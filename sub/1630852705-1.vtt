<i>The underdog Saints</i>

00:39.375 --> 00:42.916

00:43.750 --> 00:46.375
<i>If Peyton Manning</i>

00:46.458 --> 00:50.791

00:53.833 --> 00:57.250
<i>They just have some toughness</i>
<i>that they've shown all year.</i>

00:57.333 --> 00:59.083
<i>And I'll tell you, Super Bowl week,</i>

00:59.166 --> 01:02.083
<i>they weren't out playing patty-cake</i>
<i>gettin' ready for this game.</i>

01:02.166 --> 01:03.333
<i>They practiced hard.</i>

01:03.416 --> 01:05.166
Let's go! Let's go! Hut!

01:12.458 --> 01:14.708
<i>It's picked off!</i>
<i>It's picked off!</i>

01:14.791 --> 01:17.125
<i>It's Tracy Porter again!</i>
<i>He's running free!</i>

01:17.208 --> 01:18.791
<i>He's gonna go all the way!</i>

01:18.875 --> 01:22.041
<i>Hands outstretched!</i>
<i>It is a Saint touchdown!</i>

01:22.125 --> 01:24.291
<i>Seventy yards on the return!</i>

01:28.333 --> 01:30.125
<i>For the first time ever,</i>

01:30.208 --> 01:33.583
<i>the New Orleans Saints</i>
<i>are the world champions.</i>

01:39.208 --> 01:42.875
<i>It's time for the presentation</i>
<i>of the Lombardi trophy.</i>

01:42.958 --> 01:46.833
Coach Payton, what does it feel like
to be holding that trophy?

01:46.916 --> 01:49.833
Nobody thought we had a chance
when I came to New Orleans.

01:49.916 --> 01:52.291
Nobody thought we had a chance
entering this season.

01:52.791 --> 01:56.166
Nobody thought we had a chance
entering this game. It feels pretty good.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.375
I'll bet it does, Coach.

01:57.458 --> 01:59.791
But, for the record, I believed in you,

01:59.875 --> 02:02.250
and I believed in this team
from the very start.

02:02.958 --> 02:04.583
I don't remember you saying that.

02:04.666 --> 02:08.833
I didn't share that opinion publicly,
but I said it a few times around my house.

02:08.916 --> 02:09.750
Okay.

02:11.166 --> 02:12.500
You can get going now.

02:12.583 --> 02:14.000
You got it, Coach.

02:43.541 --> 02:44.625
Hey, come on in.

02:45.416 --> 02:47.416
Hey, Coach, um, I was just wondering--

02:47.500 --> 02:48.875
Get me a piece of Juicy Fruit.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.083
Okay, is that code for something?

02:52.833 --> 02:54.916
Yeah, it's code for
"I-I like the taste of gum."

02:55.000 --> 02:55.916
Get it.

03:07.166 --> 03:09.041
-You need something?
-Uh, yeah.

03:09.125 --> 03:12.625
Uh, Mr. Good-all is on the phone.
Line one.

03:13.208 --> 03:15.000
Roger Goodell on the phone?
The commissioner.

03:15.083 --> 03:16.958
Uh, he didn't say what his job was.

03:26.166 --> 03:27.000
Roger.

03:27.083 --> 03:28.708
<i>The National Football League,</i>

03:28.791 --> 03:33.875
an American institution
and ten billion-dollar-a-year industry,

03:33.958 --> 03:36.291
is caught up
in one of its biggest scandals.

03:36.375 --> 03:40.291
The New Orleans Saints paying players
to injure opponents on the field.

03:40.375 --> 03:43.583
<i>He condoned a bounty system.</i>

03:43.666 --> 03:46.166
<i>He lied about it to the NFL's faces.</i>

03:46.250 --> 03:47.541
<i>As a head coach,</i>

03:47.625 --> 03:50.000
<i>you need to be held accountable</i>
<i>and responsible.</i>

03:50.083 --> 03:52.333
<i>Coach Payton</i>
<i>has been suspended for a year.</i>

03:52.416 --> 03:54.958
<i>How much contact</i>
<i>can he have with the team?</i>

03:55.041 --> 03:57.500
<i>The league has told me Sean Payton's</i>

03:57.583 --> 04:01.166
<i>not to have any communication</i>
<i>that relates to coaching activity.</i>

04:01.250 --> 04:03.291
Okay, so you're out in front of it.

04:03.375 --> 04:07.375
Then why is it all over the news, huh?
They're throwing me to the wolves. You--

04:07.458 --> 04:08.500
<i>It cannot be condoned…</i>

04:08.583 --> 04:11.125
Well, just fix it. All right? Do your job!

04:11.208 --> 04:12.875
<i>Payton should be gone for the year.</i>

04:12.958 --> 04:15.416
<i>You know what I think</i>
<i>when people say they didn't do enough?</i>

04:15.500 --> 04:18.416
<i>You did nothing.</i>
<i>All these guys deserve what they got.</i>

05:14.541 --> 05:18.000
-Watch the line.
-On your feet, everyone. Let's go.

05:21.875 --> 05:23.666
Hey, Coach Bizone is here.

05:23.750 --> 05:26.041
I'm sorry I'm late, guys. Freaking chain.

05:26.125 --> 05:30.250
-Cool bike. You get it for Christmas?
-No. It was my neighbor's. He died.

05:30.875 --> 05:34.041
Oh, I'm sorry for your loss.
No kickstand, Coach?

05:34.125 --> 05:36.208
It didn't come with one.
That's why you lean.

05:36.291 --> 05:39.375
Coach Bizone taught us something.
It only took three seasons.

05:39.458 --> 05:42.541
All right.
That's enough. That's enough. Take a lap.

05:42.625 --> 05:43.541
Who, me?

05:44.041 --> 05:46.416
No, Mitch, not you. Them. Go. Let's go.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.458
Okay, good. I don't take a lap for nobody.

05:48.541 --> 05:49.833
You get out of here too.

05:49.916 --> 05:52.166
All right, let's get going, guys.

05:52.708 --> 05:54.041
All right, Warriors.

05:54.125 --> 05:54.958
Uh…

05:55.833 --> 05:57.458
It was a good practice, right?

05:57.541 --> 06:00.458
Marcos, way to hustle.
The rest of you, um…

06:01.166 --> 06:02.541
Yeah. You know?

06:02.625 --> 06:05.125
Remember, game is tomorrow at two o'clock.

06:05.208 --> 06:07.166
Wait. Two? I thought it was four.

06:07.250 --> 06:09.875
Come on. It was four last week
'cause it was an away game.

06:09.958 --> 06:12.208
Tomorrow's at two
because we're playing at home.

06:12.291 --> 06:14.083
Wait, who did we lose to last week?

06:14.166 --> 06:17.708
I forget. It was the team
with the orange helmets and the swords.

06:17.791 --> 06:20.541
Could've been the Vikings,
the Romans, or the Knights.

06:20.625 --> 06:22.416
-The Blacksmiths.
-Thanks, Paulie.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.791
Marcos, count us out.

06:24.875 --> 06:27.166
All right. Come on! Come in here, baby!

06:27.250 --> 06:29.458
Come on, come on! Hype up, hype up!

06:29.541 --> 06:31.041
-My body hurts.
-All right.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.041
Ready? One, two--

06:33.125 --> 06:36.291
Warriors!

06:36.375 --> 06:37.541
I got you, Coach.

06:46.791 --> 06:48.416
Hello, and how are we tonight?

06:48.500 --> 06:52.000
Uh, good, I guess.
Not sure why I even drove out here.

06:54.166 --> 06:57.500
-Are you staying with us tonight?
-Yeah, what do you have available?

06:57.583 --> 07:01.000
Let's see. All we have left
is our presidential suite.

07:01.083 --> 07:02.250
Great. I'll take it.

07:02.333 --> 07:03.833
Ah.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.958
It's $125 a night.

07:07.041 --> 07:08.166
That's fine.

07:09.291 --> 07:11.083
Do you know how long
you're gonna be staying?

07:11.166 --> 07:12.375
Mm, not sure.

07:12.458 --> 07:16.458
Because I have to put in a check-out date
in the computer. That's how it works.

07:17.750 --> 07:19.125
Let's just say three nights.

07:19.208 --> 07:21.375
If you stay four nights,
you can get the fifth free.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.958
-Fine, four nights.
-So you don't want the fifth night?

07:24.041 --> 07:26.208
Why don't you tell me
how many nights I should stay?

07:26.291 --> 07:27.916
I'm not allowed to do that, sir.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.375
Then let's go with five, as long as
the fifth night isn't more of this.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.541
Thank you for that thoughtful answer.

07:57.958 --> 08:01.458
<i>And with the blue and white</i>
<i>Warriors losing by 34 points,</i>

08:01.541 --> 08:03.916
here comes Harlan Haire
for the field goal.

08:05.625 --> 08:09.166
-There's our boy, number 44.
-There he is. Go, Connor!

08:09.250 --> 08:11.750
-Let's go, Connor!
-Connor!

08:15.333 --> 08:16.708
Harlan, you okay?

08:17.958 --> 08:19.458
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

08:21.000 --> 08:21.916
Hut!

08:27.375 --> 08:29.583
-My butthole!

08:33.125 --> 08:34.041
This is nice, huh?

08:34.625 --> 08:37.041
I'm feeling kind of dumb
wearing this, Jamie.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.583
It's cozy.

08:38.666 --> 08:43.000
Our combined body heat's actually melting
the M&M's in my trail mix.

08:43.916 --> 08:47.000
Baby, everyone is staring at us.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.250
They're not staring at us.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.000
They're staring at your ex-husband.

08:55.166 --> 08:56.250
Sean?

08:56.833 --> 08:58.208
What are you doin' here?

08:58.291 --> 09:01.250
Hey. It's nice to see you too.

09:02.250 --> 09:05.000
I didn't mean it like that.
Like, "What are you doin' here?"

09:05.083 --> 09:08.541
I meant it like, "It's nice to see you,
but what are you doin' here?"

09:08.625 --> 09:10.208
Just came to watch my son play.

09:10.291 --> 09:12.291
It's nice to meet you.
I'm a little nervous.

09:12.375 --> 09:13.708
I've only seen you on TV

09:13.791 --> 09:16.791
and in the pictures
that your ex-wife threw away of you.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.875
I'm Jamie, Beth's new husband.

09:19.958 --> 09:22.250
Oh. Sean.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.875
Sorry about the chocolate. Um…

09:25.958 --> 09:27.416
Just awkward, you know.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.000
This is your Snuggie, and you're…

09:30.666 --> 09:32.583
Don't be awkward.

09:32.666 --> 09:35.416
I'm just happy, uh,
Beth found someone to Snuggie with.

09:38.708 --> 09:41.458
What the heck was that, ref?
Come on!

09:42.083 --> 09:43.750
These kids are 12 years old!

09:43.833 --> 09:47.250
What are we teaching them about violence
and conflict resolution?

09:47.333 --> 09:49.833
<i>That's another touchdown</i>
<i>for the Vikings.</i>

09:49.916 --> 09:51.541
I'm guessing we're not the Vikings.

09:52.708 --> 09:53.833
<i>That'll do it.</i>

09:53.916 --> 09:57.666
Seems like the Warriors are gonna
save on some electricity yet again.

09:57.750 --> 09:58.791
What's with that?

09:58.875 --> 10:03.000
Once a team gets up by 40,
they turn off the scoreboard. Game over.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.708
Kind of put an end
to the trauma pain fest.

10:06.625 --> 10:08.125
Big football fan, Jamie?

10:08.208 --> 10:10.375
I'm, uh, more of a fan of my stepson.

10:11.291 --> 10:13.291
-That's why I'm here.

10:32.125 --> 10:33.041
Hi, Con.

10:34.375 --> 10:38.000
-What are you doing here?
-Wow. Glad everybody's happy to see me.

10:38.083 --> 10:40.625
Oh, he didn't mean it like that.
Did you, honey?

10:42.708 --> 10:44.416
I just came here to do some scouting.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.666
You never can find
good prospects too early.

10:47.541 --> 10:50.083
Hey, you, uh,
you played a great game out there.

10:50.666 --> 10:52.041
We lost zero to 40.

10:52.125 --> 10:55.458
No, no, I mean, you.
You were personally great.

10:55.541 --> 10:57.916
You can't help it
if all your teammates are horrible.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.166
No, no. He was…
he was good too. Couple of good guys.

11:01.250 --> 11:02.541
Couple of horrible ones.

11:02.625 --> 11:05.083
Listen, I was just hoping
to get some time together.

11:05.166 --> 11:06.791
Maybe we can catch up, you know?

11:10.875 --> 11:12.250
Good game, Connor.

11:12.333 --> 11:15.791
Hey, we're having a barbecue tomorrow
with some of Connor's teammates.

11:15.875 --> 11:16.750
Why don't you come by?

11:17.875 --> 11:20.291
-All right. Yeah, that sounds good.
-Okay.

11:20.375 --> 11:24.041
It's at three o'clock. I'm doing
some interesting things with saffron.

11:27.083 --> 11:28.750
The scoreboard thing is tough, huh?

11:29.250 --> 11:31.875
The league don't want the boys
to feel too bad about themselves.

11:31.958 --> 11:33.458
I think it makes 'em feel worse.

11:33.541 --> 11:35.625
-Definitely doesn't feel great.

11:36.250 --> 11:38.333
You did a nice job out there, Coach.

11:38.416 --> 11:41.083
Thanks. We're getting there. Troy Lambert.

11:41.166 --> 11:42.791
Hey, Troy, I'm Sean. Sean--

11:42.875 --> 11:45.875
I know who you are.
Connor's a fine young man.

11:45.958 --> 11:47.958
Well, his mom did a great job.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.958
That she did.
It was a pleasure meeting you.

11:50.041 --> 11:50.875
Okay.

11:54.166 --> 11:55.125
Hey, Sean.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.916
How you doing? Mitch Bizone.
I'm Connor's coach.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.375
Well, assistant coach. But, still,
you know, we're all part of the team.

12:02.458 --> 12:05.416
Uh, anyway, um,
I-I hope I'm not out of line here,

12:05.500 --> 12:09.208
but, uh, I am really sorry about
everything that's been goin' on with you.

12:09.291 --> 12:11.875
I mean, I've been seein'
everything all over the news.

12:11.958 --> 12:13.208
It's all good. Thank you.

12:13.291 --> 12:14.333
Bountygate!

12:14.416 --> 12:16.333
Yep. That's what they're callin' it.

12:16.416 --> 12:18.458
Yep. Newspapers, radio…

12:19.208 --> 12:20.791
-It's online too.
-Yep, I know.

12:20.875 --> 12:23.208
-You know, the Internet--
-I know what the Internet is.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.708
Yep. Bountygate.

12:24.791 --> 12:26.416
-Everyone's talking about it.
-Okay.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.208
-You okay on that thing?
-All good.

12:52.458 --> 12:54.500
Front desk. Eric speaking.

12:54.583 --> 12:57.458
Yeah, uh, could you send,
uh, maintenance up here?

12:57.541 --> 13:00.541
Uh, turn this Jacuzzi off.
It's making a lot of noise.

13:00.625 --> 13:03.166
Oh, it's not on. It's just the filter.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.375
Okay, well,
how do we get rid of the noise?

13:05.458 --> 13:07.875
Most guests find the sound soothing, sir.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.250
I find it aggravating.

13:10.750 --> 13:14.166
Okay, I could bring you up a fan
to counter the noise.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.583
But then, wouldn't I hear the fan?

13:16.666 --> 13:17.666
<i>Very much so.</i>

13:36.000 --> 13:38.291
Sean, so glad you could make it.
Come on in.

13:39.666 --> 13:42.208
I wanna shake the hand
that shook the hand of Drew Brees.

13:42.291 --> 13:45.041
-There you go. All right?
-So are you gonna be our new coach?

13:45.125 --> 13:48.208
-We need you. Like, we really need you.
-We suck so bad.

13:48.291 --> 13:49.708
Sadly, it's true.

13:49.791 --> 13:53.000
If we didn't have Marcos,
we'd be the worst team in the league.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.458
We are the worst team.

13:54.541 --> 13:58.625
But, Brian, can you imagine
how bad we'd be without Marcos?

13:58.708 --> 14:01.541
Hell yeah! I'm blowing up, man.
And I'm not gonna be here long.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.208
-Lucky to have me.
-Tell you what.

14:03.291 --> 14:04.791
You hang on to that confidence.

14:04.875 --> 14:08.333
And the rest of you, listen to your coach.
Coach Troy and Coach Bizone.

14:08.416 --> 14:10.000
-That's what you do.
-Coach Bizone.

14:10.083 --> 14:10.916
Bizone.

14:13.916 --> 14:17.375
-What's with Coach?
-He keeps drinking too much coach's juice.

14:17.458 --> 14:20.583
He doesn't think we know, but he got
his license taken away four years ago.

14:20.666 --> 14:23.000
Says the bike's part of a fitness regimen.

14:24.416 --> 14:25.625
Hey, where's Connor?

14:25.708 --> 14:27.208
Oh, he's still downstairs.

14:27.291 --> 14:30.000
All right, boys. Food's ready outside.

14:34.583 --> 14:35.416
Hey, Con.

14:39.708 --> 14:42.333
-Our boy doesn't talk much, does he?
-Can you blame him?

14:42.416 --> 14:44.500
-You missed a lot, Sean.
-I understand.

14:45.083 --> 14:47.541
But that's… That's why I'm here.

14:47.625 --> 14:49.791
That's great,
but it's gonna take some time.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.041
Let's go.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.416
Where's your helmets?

15:02.041 --> 15:03.041
Helmets.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.708
-New Orleans Saints.
<i>Emma. I-It's Emma, right?</i>

15:09.791 --> 15:12.500
Listen, it's Coach Payton.
I'm trying to get through.

15:12.583 --> 15:14.916
I need to get
to the, uh, new defensive coordinator.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.791
Mm, I'm not allowed
to be talking to you. No contact.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.416
Well, first of all,
this is nothing official, all right?

15:20.500 --> 15:23.083
We're just two friends talking.
That's all we're doing.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.750
Yeah, I'm so sorry.
I don't wanna get in trouble. Bye!

15:25.833 --> 15:28.041
Emma. Emma! Uh, Emma! Emily?

15:28.750 --> 15:29.875
Was it Emily?

15:32.500 --> 15:33.625
I think it was Emily.

15:41.041 --> 15:44.583
Connor, you've got outside contained.
Don't… don't guess.

15:49.708 --> 15:51.208
-Let's run it again.

15:51.708 --> 15:53.833
Hey, Coach, my boy's Paulie, the center.

15:53.916 --> 15:56.083
You got any pointers,
you just pipe right on up.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.500
-He needs all the help he can get.
-Sure thing.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.750
Take a look at him. He's good.

16:00.833 --> 16:02.333
He's not great, but he's good.

16:03.541 --> 16:06.541
Pretty good. He's okay.
See what you can do with him.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.000
Try that if you want to.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.708
Connor, Harlan, you guys
up for some vegan ice cream?

16:13.791 --> 16:15.750
It tastes just like regular ice cream.

16:15.833 --> 16:18.250
As long as you've never eaten
regular ice cream.

16:18.333 --> 16:19.250
Try it?

16:20.208 --> 16:21.125
Come on!

16:21.208 --> 16:23.541
It's made with green tea, banana leaves.

16:23.625 --> 16:25.083
-You'll love it.
-Sure.

16:25.166 --> 16:27.708
It's a new hemp ice cream place.
Gonna close in two weeks.

16:27.791 --> 16:29.083
I guarantee it. Come on in.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.916
Any one of you guys got any cash?
Your dad give you a credit card?

16:36.000 --> 16:37.375
Wait, you want me to pay?

16:39.291 --> 16:42.333
-Who this?
-I'm sorry. Uh, what's up, man?

16:42.416 --> 16:44.500
Nothing. I'm just saying, "Who this."

16:45.375 --> 16:46.250
Okay.

16:52.666 --> 16:54.125
Black and gold, baby.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.625
Argh! Son of a… Not again.

17:00.083 --> 17:01.708
Stupid, cheap chain.

17:16.875 --> 17:17.708
Freaking…

17:17.791 --> 17:20.583
-Another tie.

17:21.416 --> 17:22.583
Front desk.

17:22.666 --> 17:25.750
Okay. Well, now the Jacuzzi filter
won't stop babbling.

17:25.833 --> 17:27.833
Sounds like a guy
that doesn't know when to shut up.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.041
Oh, no, no, Mr. Payton.

17:30.125 --> 17:33.291
Those voices you're hearing
are from the Jacuzzi in our royal suite.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.166
-You guys have a royal suite?
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

17:36.250 --> 17:38.791
There's some fellows in there from SMU.

17:38.875 --> 17:41.291
Let me know if they get too loud.
I'll bring up a fan.

17:41.375 --> 17:45.000
Tell you what. Bring up a toaster.
We can end it all. Sound good?

17:45.083 --> 17:46.250
All right. See you then.

17:56.583 --> 17:58.541
Set! Down!

17:59.250 --> 18:00.666
Blue, white! Blue, white!

18:01.375 --> 18:02.208
Hut!

18:02.750 --> 18:04.250
<i>Marcos drops back.</i>

18:04.333 --> 18:08.166
<i>Makes the throw,</i>
<i>and it sails way over Brian's head.</i>

18:08.250 --> 18:12.833
<i>And the Warriors blow yet another chance</i>
<i>to score in the red zone.</i>

18:12.916 --> 18:15.041
<i>The Knights will now take possession.</i>

18:17.041 --> 18:19.250
It's over! Step up.

18:34.083 --> 18:35.250
This guy's got all day.

18:38.958 --> 18:40.333
Get it, get it! Come on!

18:43.958 --> 18:45.500
-Time-out.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.416
Come on, guys.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.916
Hey, Payton, two more points,
then it's lights out.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.125
This quarterback's unstoppable.

18:52.208 --> 18:55.708
No. The QB doesn't check his blind side
when he drops into the pocket.

18:56.208 --> 18:58.041
They should just bring the safeties.

19:04.708 --> 19:05.958
Where's he going?

19:06.041 --> 19:09.375
Hopefully he's gonna teach 'em to cheat.
We're getting killed out there.

19:12.250 --> 19:16.375
Oh. Coach, did you see that?
Some punk just threw my visor.

19:16.458 --> 19:19.541
-Huddle up. Let's go.
-Who? Point him out. I'll snap his neck.

19:21.625 --> 19:23.625
All right, guys.
It's that time of the game.

19:23.708 --> 19:25.083
We can't let 'em score here.

19:25.166 --> 19:27.666
I want all you d-backs
to drop into coverage, okay?

19:31.875 --> 19:33.541
Actually, not… not all of you.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.125
We're gonna blitz.

19:37.791 --> 19:38.791
Linebacker blitz?

19:40.125 --> 19:41.541
Safety blitz.

19:42.166 --> 19:43.333
From the right?

19:44.125 --> 19:47.375
From the left? Weak side safety blitz.

19:47.458 --> 19:50.041
You heard… Yeah.
Weak side safety blitz, all right, guys.

19:50.125 --> 19:51.791
Let's go get 'em. Come on! Come on!

19:51.875 --> 19:53.416
Let's do this. Come on, guys.

19:54.916 --> 19:58.291
Is this the one? Say you're sorry
to the man for throwing his visor.

19:58.375 --> 19:59.708
-Sorry.
-It's not him!

19:59.791 --> 20:01.625
You can't grab people by the neck.

20:01.708 --> 20:03.208
It's fine. It's my nephew.

20:03.291 --> 20:04.458
Son of a…

20:06.875 --> 20:08.375
Uncle Mitch, you're the worst.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.541
You're an embarrassment
to the family tree.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.125
I'll pedal over to your mama's house.

20:12.208 --> 20:15.083
You're gonna be on time-out
for, like, a month and a half.

20:16.375 --> 20:17.541
Little punk-ass.

20:27.041 --> 20:30.041
Blind 38! Blind 38!

20:36.791 --> 20:38.125
Oh, and it's a fumble.

20:39.208 --> 20:40.791
<i>Connor Payton picks it up.</i>

20:41.541 --> 20:45.500
<i>Oh my God! Can you believe this?</i>
<i>Can you believe this?</i>

20:45.583 --> 20:48.000
<i>He's at the 20. He's at the ten.</i>

20:48.666 --> 20:51.125
Oh my God! Touchdown, Warriors!

20:53.375 --> 20:55.166
-Connor!
-Connor!

20:55.250 --> 20:56.791
-That was our guy!

20:56.875 --> 20:58.708
First touchdown of the season!

20:58.791 --> 21:01.166
<i>And just as the game comes to an end.</i>

21:03.916 --> 21:05.791
That was a touchdown! A real touchdown!

21:05.875 --> 21:07.875
Take it easy. Act like you've been here.

21:07.958 --> 21:08.916
Fully happened!

21:11.416 --> 21:13.125
<i>Folks, that'll do it.</i>

21:13.208 --> 21:16.875
<i>Final score here,</i>
<i>Warriors, 6. Knights, 38.</i>

21:29.250 --> 21:33.208
Boys, boys, boys! Hey! Everybody, take
a look over there. You see what I see?

21:33.291 --> 21:36.625
Electricity!

21:42.708 --> 21:46.416
One, two, three, Warriors!

21:52.416 --> 21:53.583
This is a Manhattan?

21:54.208 --> 21:58.333
At J.D. McGilligan's,
our middle name is "Fun."

21:58.833 --> 22:03.208
Well, if that's true, shouldn't it be
"J.F. McGilligan's?"

22:04.583 --> 22:06.208
I'll ask Mr. McGilligan.

22:08.291 --> 22:11.458
Okay. I'm… I'm gonna change this
into a Lone Star? How about that?

22:17.666 --> 22:19.416
Actually, make that two Lone Stars.

22:20.333 --> 22:23.000
I hope you didn't mind me
butting in like that.

22:23.083 --> 22:26.000
Mind? That was
our first touchdown all year.

22:26.583 --> 22:27.916
Tough year, huh?

22:28.458 --> 22:30.416
Look, they're great kids.

22:31.166 --> 22:32.875
And they're not untalented.

22:32.958 --> 22:34.791
No, I know. I see speed.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.416
They're eager to learn.
They've got a good attitude.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.458
-Yeah.
-You know.

22:38.541 --> 22:39.750
Yeah. They just…

22:39.833 --> 22:43.791
They need some better plays to run
and maybe a little motivation.

22:43.875 --> 22:46.250
That's why I'm fixin'
to get a whistle around your neck.

22:46.333 --> 22:48.375
Oh, right.

22:49.958 --> 22:50.958
Oh, you're serious?

22:51.041 --> 22:54.458
No… no pressure.
Uh, we'd… we'd love to have you.

22:54.541 --> 22:58.541
I don't know how long I'm gonna be here,
'cause I'm appealing my suspension.

22:58.625 --> 23:02.375
I'm hoping to be back at work
before the season starts.

23:02.458 --> 23:03.666
You miss it?

23:03.750 --> 23:06.041
I really don't know
anything else, you know.

23:06.541 --> 23:10.750
I mean, being a head coach of an NFL team
is like going a hundred miles an hour,

23:10.833 --> 23:12.583
365 days a year.

23:12.666 --> 23:14.041
Look, I figured.

23:14.125 --> 23:16.875
I mean, I've been coaching your son
since peewee league.

23:17.500 --> 23:18.791
I just met you last week.

23:21.333 --> 23:25.958
Another reason I don't want a whistle.
I'm not even sure Connor would like it.

23:26.041 --> 23:29.708
Look, being Sean Payton's son ain't easy.

23:30.416 --> 23:32.625
Not for a kid playing football in Texas.

23:33.541 --> 23:35.750
Hell, my dad
coached our local high school team,

23:35.833 --> 23:37.166
and I never lived it down.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.333
You won the damn Super Bowl.

23:39.416 --> 23:42.333
-I never pushed him to play.
-No, but he did.

23:42.916 --> 23:45.416
And it may be easier on him,

23:45.500 --> 23:48.041
and you, and, frankly, me

23:48.916 --> 23:51.000
if you were on that field
with us every day.

23:56.125 --> 23:59.250
Come on! Get off the wall!

24:07.791 --> 24:09.208
My chain now, McGilligan.

24:09.958 --> 24:10.958
You do need help.

24:44.916 --> 24:47.583
Hey, you got any more bagels back there?

24:47.666 --> 24:49.500
Um, no.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.041
Well, what about those right there?

24:53.083 --> 24:54.833
Oh, yeah, those are for my wife.

24:54.916 --> 24:56.000
She's pregnant.

24:56.583 --> 24:57.583
This is your first?

24:57.666 --> 25:01.125
No, it's my third.
I've been nibbling all morning.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.458
I meant kids.

25:02.541 --> 25:04.250
Oh. Yeah, it's my first.

25:04.333 --> 25:06.583
Hey, listen, I'm, uh,
gonna extend my stay.

25:06.666 --> 25:08.958
-How long?
-I'm not doin' this again with you.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.291
Just extend it, okay?

25:10.375 --> 25:14.625
Now, you guys got a copy machine?
I'm gonna need 23 copies of this.

25:14.708 --> 25:16.666
Oh, technically it's self-service.

25:17.916 --> 25:20.041
I got you, Mr. Payton.

25:20.125 --> 25:24.125
-Got anything I can spread this jelly on?
-There's some hard-boiled eggs over there.

25:24.708 --> 25:26.875
I didn't say the worst thing
you could spread jelly on.

25:27.500 --> 25:28.916
You didn't say the best.

25:29.500 --> 25:30.333
God.

25:43.541 --> 25:44.500
What are you doing?

25:45.625 --> 25:46.666
What <i>was</i> I doing?

25:48.250 --> 25:49.583
Transcendental Meditation.

25:50.833 --> 25:53.000
It's where I repeat a mantra to myself

25:53.083 --> 25:55.125
until I reach
a deeper state of consciousness.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.375
Hmm. What's a mantra?

25:58.625 --> 26:02.333
A mantra is a word or a phrase
or even a noise that you repeat

26:02.416 --> 26:04.708
and it helps you focus
and clear your mind.

26:04.791 --> 26:06.541
You know, we could meditate together,

26:06.625 --> 26:09.333
and clear our minds
and share memories and feelings.

26:09.416 --> 26:11.250
-Isn't that cool?
-Well, like what?

26:11.916 --> 26:14.125
I could tell you about the time
when I was in college

26:14.208 --> 26:16.333
and I was backpacking through Asia.

26:16.416 --> 26:18.750
I thought for sure they were all women.

26:18.833 --> 26:20.041
-Jamie.
-Yes?

26:20.125 --> 26:22.375
Connor shouldn't be
hearing about that at his age.

26:22.458 --> 26:24.541
But he's… he's not hearing. He's feeling.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.166
That's even worse.

26:27.583 --> 26:30.333
Oh, that must be your dad.
He's gonna take you to practice today.

26:30.416 --> 26:31.333
What?

26:31.416 --> 26:33.833
He called this morning
and asked if he could take you.

26:33.916 --> 26:35.541
Why didn't you say no?

26:36.833 --> 26:40.458
I think it'll be good for you guys
to connect and get some one-on-one time.

26:41.375 --> 26:43.291
Well, I don't want
any one-on-one time with him.

26:45.166 --> 26:48.166
-I'm not going to practice.
-Yeah, skip practice.

26:48.250 --> 26:50.958
Stay here. I'll share with you
the time I was in a bathhouse

26:51.041 --> 26:52.625
with ten sumo wrestlers.

26:52.708 --> 26:55.375
-These guys prune up everywhere.
-All right. I'll go. I'll go.

27:03.250 --> 27:04.375
Any music you like?

27:08.916 --> 27:10.083
You still into country?

27:13.125 --> 27:14.458
You know where you're going?

27:15.500 --> 27:18.125
The only place I've been
other than my hotel for the last week?

27:18.208 --> 27:19.250
Yeah, I got an idea.

27:21.416 --> 27:22.666
I meant from my house.

27:23.958 --> 27:28.375
You know I used to live there, right?
Before the dream catchers and salt lamps.

27:29.916 --> 27:30.916
I've been told.

27:34.708 --> 27:35.541
So,

27:36.583 --> 27:39.833
guess who the new offensive coordinator
for the Warriors is?

27:41.791 --> 27:42.791
How did that happen?

27:44.125 --> 27:45.291
Coach Troy asked me,

27:45.375 --> 27:48.375
and I thought it'd be cool
because we'll get to hang.

27:49.208 --> 27:50.041
Hang?

27:50.833 --> 27:53.208
Yeah. What we're doing right now. Hangin'.

27:54.416 --> 27:57.166
It's tough enough right now
with you just in the bleachers.

27:57.666 --> 27:59.625
You know what Paulie's dad said about you?

27:59.708 --> 28:02.750
I don't give a crap
about what Paulie's dad thinks.

28:03.666 --> 28:04.541
Maybe I do.

28:08.333 --> 28:11.416
Hell yeah, I want stuffed crust.
What kind of question's that?

28:11.500 --> 28:14.083
Paulie, are you seriously
ordering a pizza right now?

28:14.166 --> 28:15.541
We're about to practice.

28:15.625 --> 28:18.541
Ordering it now
so it gets here at the peak of my hunger.

28:18.625 --> 28:20.250
I don't care. Hang up the phone.

28:20.791 --> 28:23.958
All right, Warriors. Our season
hasn't got off to the best start.

28:24.041 --> 28:26.333
What are you talking about?
We scored a touchdown.

28:31.250 --> 28:35.041
All right. All right.
True, but we did still lose 38 to 6.

28:35.125 --> 28:37.166
Wow, killing the vibe, Coach.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.416
Look, I know each of y'all
are doing your best, okay?

28:40.500 --> 28:43.958
We just need somethin'
to pull it all together. A new voice.

28:44.041 --> 28:46.250
Is Mr. Payton gonna be our new coach?

28:50.166 --> 28:53.833
Coach Payton is gonna be
our new offensive coordinator.

28:54.875 --> 28:56.208
-Okay.
-How about that?

28:56.791 --> 28:58.666
Our defense sucks too.

28:59.708 --> 29:00.583
Thank you.

29:00.666 --> 29:04.875
Look, I want you boys to treat Mr. Payton
with the same respect you treat me.

29:04.958 --> 29:07.083
Oh, oh, we can do better than that.

29:07.708 --> 29:11.875
But to clarify,
Coach Payton is third in line.

29:11.958 --> 29:14.750
In other words,
if Coach Troy were the president,

29:14.833 --> 29:16.166
I'd be the vice president.

29:16.750 --> 29:18.958
And if Coach Troy
happened to get assassinated,

29:19.041 --> 29:20.375
I'd take over.

29:20.458 --> 29:22.708
Coach Payton would then become
the vice president.

29:22.791 --> 29:25.750
Um, what happens
if both of you guys got shot?

29:26.458 --> 29:29.541
Well, I think they'd, uh, cancel.
I don't think we could play that game.

29:29.625 --> 29:32.000
Okay, that's good to know.
Guys, let's line up.

29:32.625 --> 29:35.875
-Hey, when I tell my guys to line up,

29:35.958 --> 29:38.458
the last one there,
he'd be running stairs till sundown.

29:45.666 --> 29:48.041
Gentlemen, it's about speed.

29:48.125 --> 29:50.875
So if you don't got it,
you better hurry up and get it.

29:50.958 --> 29:52.041
Now, on my count,

29:52.125 --> 29:54.625
we're gonna run to that 40-yard line
as fast as you can.

29:54.708 --> 29:56.416
You said, "On my count."

29:56.500 --> 29:58.958
How many Mississippis is that gonna be?

29:59.041 --> 30:01.250
How about this?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.625
One, two, three, four.

30:08.125 --> 30:11.833
Congratulations. You four
just became our new wide receivers.

30:13.875 --> 30:16.208
Let's get those pads on.
Let's get to work. Come on.

30:17.208 --> 30:18.833
Get over that. Go, go, go, go!

30:19.541 --> 30:20.500
Keep goin'.

30:21.500 --> 30:23.541
Whoa! Slow down there, buddy.

30:26.833 --> 30:28.250
Drop them hips down.

30:29.250 --> 30:30.250
What happened here?

30:33.166 --> 30:34.666
Quick feet, quick feet!

30:35.166 --> 30:36.791
Quick shoes. I like that.

30:37.416 --> 30:39.750
There you go. All right, come on.

30:40.500 --> 30:43.583
-Full rush, let me see it. Set, hit!

30:44.250 --> 30:46.791
Nice. Okay, Nate, all right,
let me see that spin.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.208
Set, hit!

30:55.041 --> 30:56.208
We'll get it, okay?

30:56.791 --> 30:57.958
Hey, Mitch.

31:00.750 --> 31:02.791
-That's what you get!
-Bizone is down!

31:02.875 --> 31:04.333
-All right.
-Thanks.

31:12.458 --> 31:14.833
There you go, Harlan. You got a great leg.

31:15.958 --> 31:17.250
What's happenin' during the game?

31:17.750 --> 31:20.708
This is practice. No pressure in practice.

31:20.791 --> 31:23.000
That's your problem.
You know what the pros do?

31:23.083 --> 31:25.083
They put all the pressure on
during practice

31:25.166 --> 31:27.541
so that when the game comes along,
there's none left.

31:27.625 --> 31:29.291
Paulie, how you doing at center?

31:29.375 --> 31:32.875
It doesn't matter. I'm just playing
so my dad can relive his glory days.

31:32.958 --> 31:36.875
If you're not happy by end of the season,
I'll talk to him. How's that sound?

31:36.958 --> 31:38.833
-Really?
-Yep, but I'm not gonna have to.

31:38.916 --> 31:40.083
Everybody, listen up.

31:40.166 --> 31:43.250
The only reason to play football
is to have fun.

31:43.333 --> 31:44.750
And the only way to have fun

31:45.750 --> 31:46.583
is to win.

31:47.666 --> 31:49.000
And the only way to win

31:50.791 --> 31:52.000
is with this.

31:52.083 --> 31:53.166
A new playbook?

31:53.250 --> 31:55.875
Whoa!

31:55.958 --> 31:56.916
Awesome!

32:00.000 --> 32:01.833
Are these real NFL plays?

32:01.916 --> 32:03.208
Oh my God!

32:03.291 --> 32:05.083
We'll be winning the championship.

32:06.166 --> 32:07.958
-How can they stop us?
-Whoa!

32:08.041 --> 32:09.041
Look at Page 16.

32:09.875 --> 32:12.041
I see you made a few minor changes.

32:12.125 --> 32:14.041
It's upside down. Just turn it.

32:14.541 --> 32:15.541
-Oh.
-Yeah.

32:16.458 --> 32:17.375
Got it.

32:17.458 --> 32:20.583
Yeah. The base is all there.
I just expanded on it, that's all.

32:20.666 --> 32:23.791
Listen, I want you to study them,
take 'em home with you tonight.

32:23.875 --> 32:26.666
-Keep 'em with you at all times.
-Yes, sir.

32:26.750 --> 32:27.708
All right.

32:30.583 --> 32:31.791
What play is this?

32:35.458 --> 32:38.791
Mr. Coach Payton.
Cindy Jenkins, Dennis's mom.

32:38.875 --> 32:41.333
-Nice to meet you.
-I wanna talk to you about Dennis.

32:41.416 --> 32:44.750
Whatever position I asked him to play,
that's what he's playing for a while.

32:44.833 --> 32:48.041
I don't care what position he's playin'
as long as he's playin' football.

32:48.125 --> 32:52.083
I just don't want you goin' easy on him.
That little peanut needs toughenin' up.

32:52.166 --> 32:55.041
I treat all my players the same.
Always have.

32:55.125 --> 32:57.416
It's just Dennis is so nice and sweet.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.875
This is Texas, Coach. That won't fly.

32:59.958 --> 33:03.500
-Sounds like a job for Dennis's dad.
-Oh, he's out the picture.

33:03.583 --> 33:07.208
He went out to Meineke for a new muffler
in 2007 and never came back.

33:07.291 --> 33:09.416
All right, well, I'm sorry about that.

33:10.333 --> 33:12.500
Listen, come on over to the house.

33:12.583 --> 33:16.083
Run some drills with him, maybe me.
I'll make dinner.

33:16.666 --> 33:20.708
It's awful nice of you,
but, uh, it's not necessary.

33:20.791 --> 33:24.333
Well, how many nights in a row
can you eat at J.D. McGilligan's?

33:24.416 --> 33:25.875
I'm making gumbo.

33:27.708 --> 33:29.583
Please, for Dennis.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.708
All right, fine, but for now,
I got a game to get ready for, so…

33:33.791 --> 33:35.791
-You do you, baby.
-Mm-hmm.

33:39.708 --> 33:41.250
Got a girlfriend!

33:41.916 --> 33:43.541
New Orleans Saints, huh?

33:44.125 --> 33:46.291
I was a hell of a running back myself.

33:46.375 --> 33:49.625
In '86, I was the man.

33:49.708 --> 33:53.708
I scored a touchdown
with four defenders on my back.

33:53.791 --> 33:56.208
Blown out knee, blown out ankle,

33:56.291 --> 33:59.583
severe jock itch, a cavity,

33:59.666 --> 34:01.375
everybody still on my back,

34:02.041 --> 34:03.958
helped a woman have a baby,

34:04.041 --> 34:05.625
scored the touchdown,

34:05.708 --> 34:08.083
did my touchdown dance,

34:08.166 --> 34:11.458
and came home to save my mama
from a heart attack.

34:12.625 --> 34:14.625
Gus, keep your eyes on the road.

34:15.875 --> 34:17.583
Still got the jock itch though.

34:21.041 --> 34:22.875
<i>With the Rams leading 6-0,</i>

34:22.958 --> 34:26.125
<i>they have the ball</i>
<i>on the Warriors' 45-yard line.</i>

34:26.208 --> 34:28.875
<i>Second down with three yards to go</i>
<i>for the first down.</i>

34:32.500 --> 34:33.708
Come on, Dennis!

34:34.625 --> 34:36.416
Go, Dennis!

34:37.916 --> 34:39.250
Mama!

34:48.541 --> 34:52.041
-Did Dennis just fall down?
-Yeah, he doesn't like contact.

34:52.125 --> 34:53.583
Does he know he's playin' football?

34:58.500 --> 35:00.208
Hey, uh, Dennis, come here.

35:01.708 --> 35:04.916
So you, uh…
you wanna tackle that guy, huh?

35:05.625 --> 35:07.791
I mean, I did. Then I didn't.

35:09.791 --> 35:11.583
Coach Troy and I
have been thinking about it,

35:11.666 --> 35:13.708
and we're gonna move you to fullback.

35:14.416 --> 35:17.666
Fullback? I-I can't play fullback.
Everyone's gonna try and hit me.

35:17.750 --> 35:19.708
Well, you better make sure
that they don't.

35:25.541 --> 35:28.791
That was good.
Some real sports psychology right there.

35:28.875 --> 35:30.041
Yeah, a little bit.

35:31.750 --> 35:33.208
What you got in there?

35:33.291 --> 35:34.333
Uh, it's for my…

35:35.250 --> 35:37.375
It's for my, uh, skin condition.

35:39.041 --> 35:39.875
Yeah.

35:41.208 --> 35:46.041
I want 42 long, I-formation,
wideout trips, all right? Go, go, go, go!

35:48.041 --> 35:49.541
All right, huddle up, uh…

35:50.416 --> 35:55.208
42 long, I-formation wide,
something, something.

35:55.291 --> 35:58.041
-Wait. Am I the formation?
-Who's number 42?

35:58.125 --> 36:00.250
-Dennis, we're on offense.
-They told me to come.

36:00.333 --> 36:02.916
-Where am I supposed to line up?
-You're the center.

36:03.000 --> 36:03.958
Right.

36:04.041 --> 36:05.666
Didn't any of you study the plays?

36:05.750 --> 36:07.708
My dad didn't even understand these plays.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.875
-Everyone, just go long.
-Okay, ready?

36:09.958 --> 36:10.916
Ready!

36:11.000 --> 36:13.041
Watch that pass! Watch that pass!

36:15.500 --> 36:17.708
Set! Set!

36:17.791 --> 36:20.458
Blue, white. Blue, white. Hut!

36:37.583 --> 36:39.125
-Whoa!
-Uh, thanks.

36:39.791 --> 36:40.833
Way to go, Coach.

36:40.916 --> 36:42.458
Good job, good job.

36:42.541 --> 36:44.416
Marcos, nice throw.

36:47.666 --> 36:50.250
All right. Hey, good first half.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.541
Some minor adjustments, all right? Marcos.

36:52.625 --> 36:53.500
Coach.

36:53.583 --> 36:55.583
You are the most talented player
on our team.

36:55.666 --> 36:56.958
-Too true.
-Don't remind him.

36:57.041 --> 36:59.208
-Second most talented.

36:59.291 --> 37:02.541
Focus up, boys.
Listen. You're not a quarterback.

37:02.625 --> 37:05.291
-We're moving you to running back.
-I'll do both. I could do it all.

37:05.375 --> 37:08.166
You can't play QB and running back
at the same time.

37:08.250 --> 37:10.458
All good. Whatever the team needs, baby.

37:10.541 --> 37:12.041
Okay. What did you call me?

37:13.041 --> 37:14.500
-Coach.
-That's what I thought.

37:14.583 --> 37:17.250
-Brian, you're new starting quarterback.
-Yes!

37:17.750 --> 37:19.458
Finally! You can all suck it.

37:19.541 --> 37:22.375
Brian, you know in the NFL,
when the linemen don't like the QB,

37:22.458 --> 37:24.875
you know what they do?
They let the defense through.

37:25.458 --> 37:27.500
Sorry, everybody. I'll suck it.

37:27.583 --> 37:28.541
Yeah!

37:28.625 --> 37:30.000
Okay, guys, let's go.

37:30.666 --> 37:32.791
Everybody else,
you're in the same positions.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.500
Let's get some effort.
A little energy. Let's go!

37:37.583 --> 37:39.125
Sure about doing this at halftime?

37:39.208 --> 37:41.583
What we were doing wasn't workin'.
We gotta adjust.

37:41.666 --> 37:44.291
I don't wanna adjust these kids
into the emergency room.

37:44.375 --> 37:45.208
They'll be fine.

37:45.291 --> 37:47.833
They can barely play the positions
they've been playing all year.

37:58.541 --> 38:02.083
They're all in different places.
That's good?

38:02.166 --> 38:03.583
He switched it all up.

38:04.166 --> 38:05.916
Dennis, I think you're over here.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.708
-Why ain't Marcos the quarterback?
-I don't know.

38:10.875 --> 38:13.500
Ready. Set. Go!

38:24.125 --> 38:26.666
Now that could not have been
an actual play.

38:27.333 --> 38:30.958
Maybe we go back to the old, dumb,
peewee playbook for the rest of the game.

38:31.041 --> 38:34.291
I know this is like buildin' an airplane
while you're flyin' it, but trust me.

38:34.375 --> 38:39.125
Yeah, more like crappin' in a rainstorm
when you're buildin' an outhouse.

38:39.708 --> 38:42.291
-That doesn't make sense.
-Neither do these plays, Troy.

38:42.375 --> 38:45.208
Let's get you some water.
Come on, come on.

38:45.291 --> 38:46.625
Let's go. Field goal unit.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.458
What the hell is he lookin' at?

39:04.083 --> 39:04.958
Harlan.

39:07.500 --> 39:08.416
Hike.

39:11.125 --> 39:13.083
My butthole!

39:13.166 --> 39:14.416
Come on!

39:17.333 --> 39:18.416
Hey, Payton!

39:18.500 --> 39:21.125
You can't just switch everything up.
This ain't no merry-go-round.

39:21.208 --> 39:24.250
What you doin'? Marcos has been
a quarterback his whole life.

39:24.333 --> 39:26.333
He'll be a running back
for the rest of it.

39:26.416 --> 39:28.208
Are you blind? My boy's got a cannon.

39:28.291 --> 39:30.333
He's the best player on the team
besides Paulie.

39:30.416 --> 39:32.416
He's more of an asset as a running back.

39:32.500 --> 39:36.500
He's not one of your assets.
He's my son, and he's a quarterback.

39:36.583 --> 39:37.458
Here's the thing.

39:38.250 --> 39:39.583
I'm here to win games,

39:39.666 --> 39:42.625
not make you feel better
about what position your son's playing.

39:42.708 --> 39:44.875
So stay in the stands with the parents,

39:44.958 --> 39:46.958
and I'll be on the sidelines
with the coaches.

39:48.666 --> 39:51.208
Guys, give it a chance, please.

39:56.083 --> 39:59.333
I think we're, uh, finished here, fellas,
for the day.

40:02.208 --> 40:03.958
The bus is full anyway.

40:08.458 --> 40:10.916
Man, I expected today to go better.

40:11.500 --> 40:14.125
Yeah, we're worse than we were
before he showed up.

40:14.208 --> 40:17.375
I thought this guy was supposed to be
some type of Super Bowl-winning coach.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.916
Yeah, and we scored a touchdown
without him.

40:20.000 --> 40:20.916
Yeah.

40:27.583 --> 40:29.583
All right, boys, listen up.

40:29.666 --> 40:34.083
I know it might not have felt like it,
but I saw a lot of improvement out there.

40:34.166 --> 40:35.958
As soon as we get a handle
on these new plays,

40:36.041 --> 40:38.000
we're gonna turn things around real quick.

40:38.083 --> 40:42.083
Yeah, um, Coach, I don't think any of us
understand the new plays.

40:42.166 --> 40:45.041
What? Who's having trouble
with the playbook?

40:48.000 --> 40:51.125
It looks unanimous.

40:52.291 --> 40:54.958
Gotta line up here.
I want everybody hip-to-hip here.

40:55.041 --> 40:57.958
I don't want any space here.
People were getting through here.

40:58.041 --> 41:00.125
Salt shaker right there… Okay?

41:00.208 --> 41:01.708
We gotta get set up here.

41:01.791 --> 41:04.166
Connor, Jason, you are our tortilla chips.

41:04.250 --> 41:08.041
That means, Dennis and Marcos,
you're our lime wedges. You're right here.

41:08.125 --> 41:12.291
-Which makes our hot sauce… That's Brian.
-Brian's more of a napkin.

41:12.375 --> 41:16.125
We're going green right formation.
That's our initial formation. You with me?

41:16.208 --> 41:17.416
Yes, Coach. Yeah.

41:17.500 --> 41:21.375
Great. Okay. Now we have our X chip
on the side here, and our Z--

41:21.458 --> 41:24.000
-Where's the Z chip? What did you do?
-Sorry.

41:24.083 --> 41:25.375
All right. Okay, here we go.

41:25.458 --> 41:28.541
We got our Z chip here,
but we're gonna send our Z chip in motion.

41:28.625 --> 41:31.000
Now we have both wide receivers
on this side.

41:31.083 --> 41:34.708
Once they cross the line of scrimmage,
they cut right, which means our hot sauce…

41:34.791 --> 41:37.083
-I drop back and fake it to the lime.
-Yes.

41:37.166 --> 41:39.166
I'm the lime.
I pretend to get the ball and block?

41:39.250 --> 41:40.250
Yeah.

41:40.333 --> 41:43.625
-Jason and I cut to the right.
-I throw it to the open tortilla chip.

41:43.708 --> 41:45.250
Yes! There you go!

41:47.500 --> 41:48.875
Now let's go with X whip.

41:48.958 --> 41:51.416
We're gonna do the same thing,
but we're not linin' up that way.

41:51.500 --> 41:53.541
We'll bring this chip here. Don't eat it.

41:53.625 --> 41:56.166
Hey, Coach, what if a cupcake
tries to attack 'em?

41:56.250 --> 41:59.166
-You're afraid of a cupcake now?
-Cupcakes sound good.

41:59.250 --> 42:01.291
-Can I see a dessert menu?

42:01.375 --> 42:04.375
You get that first step,
you're up the sideline, you know?

42:04.458 --> 42:05.375
It's all you.

42:06.916 --> 42:09.416
You gonna stick around
for the rest of the season?

42:10.708 --> 42:14.875
Well, if I win my appeal, I'll probably…
I'll probably have to go back.

42:17.625 --> 42:18.458
Con,

42:19.208 --> 42:20.083
it's my job.

42:21.916 --> 42:26.000
-I wish you guys were closer.
-Why can't you be closer?

42:26.083 --> 42:29.541
Coach the Cowboys.
Dallas is, like, 45 minutes away.

42:29.625 --> 42:31.500
'Cause Dallas already has a coach.

42:33.625 --> 42:34.458
Look,

42:35.666 --> 42:37.375
I know this hasn't been easy.

42:38.500 --> 42:39.333
No, you don't.

42:40.583 --> 42:41.541
What do you mean?

42:45.125 --> 42:46.291
What is it, Con?

42:49.000 --> 42:51.500
People always ask me about you.

42:53.458 --> 42:56.291
And most of the time,
I have to just make it up, because…

42:59.833 --> 43:00.708
I don't know you.

43:04.041 --> 43:07.541
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
C-Connor, look, I'm here.

43:08.208 --> 43:09.041
I'm here now.

43:10.666 --> 43:11.875
You can ask me anything.

43:13.500 --> 43:14.666
What do you wanna know?

43:19.541 --> 43:22.750
What made you decide to go
for the onside kick in the Super Bowl?

43:24.416 --> 43:25.666
That's a good question.

43:26.375 --> 43:29.041
Sometimes to succeed,
you need to do the unexpected.

43:29.541 --> 43:33.250
That's what I did with that onside kick.
I knew it would surprise 'em, and it did.

43:35.500 --> 43:37.000
Any other questions?

43:38.833 --> 43:39.666
Did you do it?

43:41.750 --> 43:42.666
Do what?

43:43.416 --> 43:44.875
What happened with your team.

43:46.833 --> 43:48.125
It's complicated, Connor.

43:49.250 --> 43:51.833
But look, at the end of the day,
I'm the head coach,

43:51.916 --> 43:54.541
so I-I-I've gotta be the one
to take responsibility.

43:57.541 --> 44:00.250
If you're taking responsibility,
then why are you appealing?

44:01.250 --> 44:02.083
Wow.

44:03.375 --> 44:05.250
That's another good question.

44:07.041 --> 44:08.166
I don't know. I guess…

44:09.500 --> 44:12.791
I couldn't see myself
being away from football for another year.

44:13.916 --> 44:16.416
Well, you're not away from it anymore,
I guess.

44:22.125 --> 44:24.250
You gonna pick me up
for practice tomorrow?

44:24.333 --> 44:26.583
Assuming Coach Troy doesn't fire me.

44:46.291 --> 44:50.375
Nine seconds left. We're down
by two. This is it. This is our season.

44:50.458 --> 44:53.375
We make it or break it right here.
We got time for one more play.

44:54.750 --> 44:58.500
And this is how we define ourselves.
We gotta decide who do we want to be?

44:58.583 --> 45:00.625
-Paulie, pay attention!
-Y-Yes, Coach.

45:00.708 --> 45:04.625
Here's where we're goin'. We're gonna go
turbo stack, green four. Okay?

45:04.708 --> 45:07.208
-What?
-Two limes. One hot sauce.

45:07.291 --> 45:09.250
-Bring the queso?
-Bring the queso, guys!

45:09.333 --> 45:13.000
Yeah!

45:16.000 --> 45:16.875
Let's go!

45:19.500 --> 45:20.750
Go, seven!

45:21.833 --> 45:22.791
Let's go!

45:30.083 --> 45:32.416
Get down! Go, baby! Go!

45:33.291 --> 45:35.500
Down, set, go!

45:38.333 --> 45:41.208
Get it. You got it. Yeah!

45:41.875 --> 45:42.916
Come on, Marcos.

45:47.458 --> 45:50.291
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go!

46:00.333 --> 46:02.041
Jamie, we won! We won!

46:02.708 --> 46:04.666
-We won our first game!
-We won!

46:14.916 --> 46:16.083
Way to go, man.

46:26.375 --> 46:28.500
Over here! I'm open!

46:30.291 --> 46:32.958
Ah, so this is what it feels like to win.

46:33.041 --> 46:35.458
-Next stop, championship!
-Yeah!

46:36.000 --> 46:37.500
Don't get ahead of yourself, Jason.

46:37.583 --> 46:40.750
No, no, no. I like the energy.
Hey, listen up, everybody.

46:40.833 --> 46:43.958
Hey, you guys earned this, okay? Enjoy it.

46:44.458 --> 46:46.500
I want you to carry this feeling
to the next game.

46:46.583 --> 46:48.750
Yeah!

47:01.666 --> 47:04.291
Hi. We're getting a lot of complaints.

47:04.375 --> 47:05.458
About what?

47:05.541 --> 47:08.875
The noise. Splashing noises, mostly,
with some yelling.

47:09.875 --> 47:10.708
Who complained?

47:11.291 --> 47:13.250
Uh, hotel people.

47:13.333 --> 47:14.416
What hotel people?

47:14.500 --> 47:15.333
Uh…

47:18.416 --> 47:20.000
No one complained, did they, Eric?

47:20.625 --> 47:21.583
No.

47:21.666 --> 47:23.416
Why are you upset about the noise?

47:23.500 --> 47:26.083
It's bumming me out that you guys
get to swim and I have to work.

47:26.166 --> 47:28.541
Well, why don't you take a break
and swim with us?

47:28.625 --> 47:29.666
-Really?
-Absolutely.

47:29.750 --> 47:32.625
That would be great! Do you think
it'd be okay if I swam in my underwear?

47:32.708 --> 47:34.958
-I think that would be inappropriate.
-Oh.

47:35.041 --> 47:36.083
Hey, do you work here?

47:36.166 --> 47:37.000
I do.

47:37.083 --> 47:39.125
Someone got their hand stuck
in the ice machine.

47:39.208 --> 47:40.041
Oh.

47:41.083 --> 47:42.333
We've all been there.

47:42.916 --> 47:44.083
Hey, good move.

47:48.208 --> 47:49.541
Connor, go deep.

48:13.916 --> 48:15.166
Warriors!

48:17.250 --> 48:18.791
Dennis, don't turn around.

48:23.333 --> 48:25.416
Oh my God, Connor Payton recovers!

48:35.791 --> 48:36.708
Come on. Come on.

48:37.333 --> 48:38.375
Whoa!

48:51.166 --> 48:52.166
Yes!

48:52.250 --> 48:53.166
That's my boy!

48:55.458 --> 48:56.833
Harlan, get in here.

48:58.125 --> 48:59.291
Okay, Coach.

49:01.833 --> 49:03.958
Is that what this is about?
That young lady?

49:04.041 --> 49:05.500
It's got nothing to do with her.

49:05.583 --> 49:08.791
Hey, I need you to focus.
Forget about everything else.

49:08.875 --> 49:12.000
Block it out. All right?
She… she is not here.

49:12.083 --> 49:14.375
She's right there. I see her.

49:14.458 --> 49:18.958
Hey, hey, we practice hard so that
there's no pressure in the game, remember?

49:19.041 --> 49:21.416
Okay. I'm gonna do it, Coach.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.416
All right. That's my boy. Go get 'em.

49:23.500 --> 49:25.166
Line it up. Let's go.

49:25.250 --> 49:26.958
-Think he's gonna do it?
-Nope.

49:27.458 --> 49:29.708
He looks even more scared
than the last time.

49:29.791 --> 49:31.958
I know. What a little wussy.

49:32.041 --> 49:34.208
Come on! Let's go, Warriors!

49:34.708 --> 49:36.500
-Hut!
<i>The ball is snapped.</i>

49:36.583 --> 49:38.125
<i>-Harlan with the kick.</i>

49:39.583 --> 49:40.916
My butthole!

49:41.000 --> 49:44.791
And the Warriors win,
but the extra point is no good.

49:46.875 --> 49:47.750
Thank you, Mom.

49:49.166 --> 49:50.708
Let's go!

49:54.833 --> 49:56.791
Did you see Connor score that goal?

49:56.875 --> 49:59.375
Yeah. I was, uh… I was… I was out there.

49:59.458 --> 50:01.166
Yes, I saw you.

50:01.958 --> 50:03.666
I like you and Connor connecting.

50:03.750 --> 50:05.750
You said it would take some time,
and it did,

50:05.833 --> 50:08.291
but I feel like we're moving
in the right direction.

50:08.375 --> 50:11.333
You know, when I was a kid,
I idolized my father so much.

50:11.416 --> 50:14.125
Then, when I was eight, they got divorced.

50:14.208 --> 50:17.416
My dad moved out.
I resented him so much. I…

50:18.125 --> 50:20.750
He used to call the house.
I wouldn't even pick up the phone.

50:21.666 --> 50:23.666
He'd come by outside school, and I…

50:24.916 --> 50:27.833
I'd walk right by him
and not even acknowledge him.

50:27.916 --> 50:29.375
I know that must've hurt him.

50:32.041 --> 50:33.666
So when did you guys reconnect?

50:33.750 --> 50:35.000
Oh, we never did.

50:35.625 --> 50:39.416
Yeah. He could be dead by now.
It was 30 years ago, but…

50:40.125 --> 50:41.958
Anyway, good game today.

50:42.958 --> 50:45.500
Uh, why… Why would you tell me that story?

50:46.750 --> 50:50.916
You're wearing the same cologne as he did,
and it just reminded me of him.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.083
I-I don't wear cologne.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.666
Oh. My bad. Sorry about that.

51:00.750 --> 51:01.666
I just thought…

51:01.750 --> 51:05.666
I-I got a whiff of something, and I…
I just spilled my maté.

51:05.750 --> 51:06.708
It's okay.

51:07.333 --> 51:08.416
Sorry again.

51:13.291 --> 51:15.625
Oh, right on time.

51:15.708 --> 51:17.500
Oh, and dressed so snazzy.

51:17.583 --> 51:19.958
-Come on in.
-Thank you for having me.

51:20.041 --> 51:22.041
Oh, and you brought a tiny cake.

51:25.083 --> 51:27.583
Hey there, buddy. What you working on?

51:27.666 --> 51:29.958
-Oh, Spanish.
-<i>Bueno.</i>

51:30.041 --> 51:30.875
Huh?

51:32.291 --> 51:35.708
I hope you like Pinot Grigio.
We drink a lot of it.

51:35.791 --> 51:36.875
"We"?

51:38.000 --> 51:42.208
Well, just me.
Makes it more fun around here.

51:42.291 --> 51:44.708
You know, I-I think I'm good on the wine.

51:44.791 --> 51:48.250
You know, we got a big game tomorrow.
Right, Dennis? The Porcupines.

51:48.333 --> 51:50.791
They've been league champs
for four years in a row.

51:50.875 --> 51:52.750
Hope they don't humiliate us too bad.

51:52.833 --> 51:54.833
Hey, <i>muy pesimistico.</i>

51:58.958 --> 52:01.291
Oh, you're so funny, Sean.

52:10.541 --> 52:15.083
But I sense a lot of pain
underneath that jovial exterior.

52:15.166 --> 52:17.083
Was it a rough breakup with Beth?

52:17.166 --> 52:19.166
It was… It was just one of those things.

52:19.250 --> 52:20.791
Oh, I see.

52:21.291 --> 52:25.250
Yeah, those skinny girls
can never handle a strong, robust man.

52:25.333 --> 52:28.208
They snap like a twig under real pressure.

52:29.625 --> 52:32.041
I don't think we should talk about it
in front of Dennis.

52:32.125 --> 52:33.958
-Dennis, go to your room.
-But I'm hungry.

52:34.041 --> 52:35.791
You always hungry.

52:35.875 --> 52:40.625
I'm pretty hungry too. It smells amazing.
So why don't we, uh, get to dinner, huh?

52:41.250 --> 52:43.125
You should see how I do on breakfast.

52:44.708 --> 52:45.708
Oh, hold on now.

52:46.250 --> 52:47.875
Oh, eyelash stuck. Hold on.

52:47.958 --> 52:51.166
Let me just see if I can just
put my fingernail up in there.

52:51.250 --> 52:53.500
And, nope. Damn it. I can't get it open.

52:53.583 --> 52:56.000
I need to run to the ladies' room
to unstick this.

52:56.083 --> 52:58.458
It won't be but a minute.

52:58.541 --> 53:00.916
Dennis, check on that gumbo.

53:01.000 --> 53:03.833
-I don't wanna get it burnt up for Coach.
-Yes, Mama.

53:07.500 --> 53:10.791
-I gotta take this. This is important.
-This is your chance to get out.

53:11.916 --> 53:14.833
-Yeah. Tell your mom I said thank you.
Just go!

53:16.541 --> 53:19.500
Hey, great timing with the call.
How'd we do?

53:19.583 --> 53:22.375
<i>Sorry. It's over.</i>
<i>They aren't gonna let you coach this year.</i>

53:22.458 --> 53:24.958
What? You said
you were out in front of this thing.

53:25.041 --> 53:27.625
-Come on, guys. Let's go.

53:27.708 --> 53:29.125
There he is. Hurry up.

53:29.208 --> 53:31.541
You lost your appeal with the NFL.
Any comments?

53:31.625 --> 53:33.541
I'm just here
to watch my son play football.

53:33.625 --> 53:36.083
It has nothing to do
with my situation with the NFL.

53:36.166 --> 53:37.666
-Just a few questions.
-No comment.

53:37.750 --> 53:40.000
-Hey, Marcos, say something.
-I have a comment.

53:40.083 --> 53:41.250
Coach Payton is the best!

53:41.333 --> 53:43.750
-Yeah!
-Come on. Let's go.

53:43.833 --> 53:46.458
-We got a game. Focus.
-Harlan loves you, Brooke Davis!

53:46.541 --> 53:49.333
-Not guilty!
-No comment. No comment.

53:49.416 --> 53:50.916
They weren't asking you nothin'.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.875
-Porcupine! Stick 'em!

53:53.958 --> 53:55.375
-Stick 'em!

53:55.875 --> 53:57.083
Stick 'em!

53:59.375 --> 54:00.875
-Stick 'em!

54:06.583 --> 54:08.333
Hey, don't… don't look at them.

54:09.250 --> 54:11.666
Eyes up here, guys. Let's go. Come on.

54:11.750 --> 54:14.750
Why, ain't this nice?
Super Bowl-winning coach.

54:15.375 --> 54:17.375
Eastern Illinois Hall of Fame.

54:17.458 --> 54:20.291
Coach of the Year, 2006.

54:21.666 --> 54:22.666
And now you're here.

54:23.250 --> 54:24.625
-Porcupine!

54:24.708 --> 54:26.166
-Stick 'em!

54:34.083 --> 54:36.500
Oh!

54:37.500 --> 54:40.041
Personal foul! Roughing the passer!

54:40.541 --> 54:41.541
Yes!

54:41.625 --> 54:44.583
Was that Drew Brees we just
dropped? Don't look like Drew Brees.

54:44.666 --> 54:47.875
Not quite the same footwork.

54:47.958 --> 54:50.083
Give me some.
You gotta give me some quicker.

54:50.166 --> 54:54.416
I mean, there's no way these guys are 12.
52 doesn't look like no kid.

54:55.083 --> 54:56.458
He looks like he has a kid.

54:58.041 --> 55:01.166
Set. Blue, 88. Blue, 88. Hike.

55:04.291 --> 55:05.333
Go! Go!

55:06.166 --> 55:08.958
<i>That's another touchdown</i>
<i>for the Porcupines.</i>

55:09.041 --> 55:09.875
Yes!

55:09.958 --> 55:11.375
Hey, Fancy Pants!

55:11.458 --> 55:13.791
Your big ole trophy don't scare me.

55:13.875 --> 55:16.250
You in football country now. I own you.

55:16.333 --> 55:18.541
-Is there any way to stop them?

55:19.083 --> 55:21.125
Not unless you wanna put Gus on the line.

55:21.208 --> 55:22.750
Put me in, Coach.

55:24.458 --> 55:26.291
Down, set, go.

55:31.125 --> 55:34.000
Fumble! Go! Go! Go!

55:52.791 --> 55:56.083
<i>And that's another touchdown</i>
<i>for the Porcupines.</i>

55:56.166 --> 55:57.458
It's too easy!

55:57.541 --> 55:59.500
<i>Which will</i>
<i>close this one out.</i>

56:00.000 --> 56:03.125
Guys, just a disastrous effort
by Sean Payton.

56:03.208 --> 56:04.041
That's that.

56:09.666 --> 56:10.916
Good game, Big Time.

56:11.416 --> 56:13.500
<i>You remember</i>
<i>the last time Sean Payton was on?</i>

56:13.583 --> 56:16.958
<i>I think he injured his shoulder.</i>
<i>He was pattin' himself on the back,</i>

56:17.041 --> 56:20.625
<i>telling us the offensive innovator</i>
<i>and all this great stuff.</i>

56:20.708 --> 56:22.750
<i>Well, he lost his appeal.</i>

56:22.833 --> 56:25.125
<i>The Saints just won</i>
<i>their first game without him,</i>

56:25.208 --> 56:27.708
<i>and he's coaching</i>
<i>his 12-year-old son's football team.</i>

56:27.791 --> 56:30.500
<i>And what did they do</i>
<i>with Sean Payton as their head coach?</i>

56:30.583 --> 56:33.625
<i>They got crushed</i>
<i>by their crosstown rivals, the Porcupines.</i>

56:33.708 --> 56:38.041
<i>Woo! That's the hit</i>
<i>you only see in your nightmares. </i>

56:38.125 --> 56:43.166
<i>I know that coach, Daryl Fitzsimmons,</i>
<i>had to love this, because he…</i>

56:43.250 --> 56:45.375
Hey, change the channel, would you?

56:46.333 --> 56:47.791
<i>Doesn't get any worse than that--</i>

56:47.875 --> 56:50.541
<i>Ouch. Maybe Payton's lost his magic touch.</i>

56:50.625 --> 56:53.416
<i>It makes you wonder</i>
<i>if the Saints will even bring him back.</i>

56:53.500 --> 56:55.708
<i>Maybe they'll hire</i>
<i>the coach from the Porcupines.</i>

56:55.791 --> 56:58.250
That Porcupines coach is pretty good.

56:59.250 --> 57:00.916
Has some funny zingers.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.333
Like, one time at a gas station,

57:03.416 --> 57:07.791
he told me I looked like
if Ellen DeGeneres and a robot had a baby.

57:07.875 --> 57:09.125
So good.

57:12.166 --> 57:13.125
God.

57:19.833 --> 57:23.500
Payton, maybe it's time to give Marcos
another chance at QB? What do you say?

57:23.583 --> 57:26.833
Hey, Calvin. Funny, I didn't hear from you
when we won six straight.

57:26.916 --> 57:29.500
Yeah, and Paulie's tired
of getting kicked in the ass too.

57:29.583 --> 57:31.958
All right. I forgot my notebook
on the sidelines.

57:32.041 --> 57:34.333
Let me go grab it
so I can write some notes down.

57:34.833 --> 57:37.166
-Oh. Okay.
-Thanks for considering that.

57:42.791 --> 57:45.250
-You mind if I address the whole team?
-Be my guest.

57:47.166 --> 57:48.333
Everybody, take a knee.

57:52.041 --> 57:53.791
That was a bad loss.

57:54.416 --> 57:56.291
We are going to get our revenge.

57:56.375 --> 57:57.916
We don't play them again.

57:58.000 --> 57:58.958
Oh, thank God.

57:59.458 --> 58:03.375
We play them again in 27 days.
In the championship game.

58:03.458 --> 58:05.875
I know they're gonna be
at the championship game,

58:05.958 --> 58:08.166
but how are we gonna get there?

58:08.250 --> 58:11.125
-We'd have to win the rest of our games.
-That's right, Jason.

58:11.208 --> 58:13.875
You guys know what Drew Brees does
after every game?

58:14.916 --> 58:18.791
When everybody else has gone home,
Drew stays on the field,

58:18.875 --> 58:21.250
and he runs through
the progressions in his head

58:22.083 --> 58:23.916
to see what he could've done better.

58:24.416 --> 58:26.625
That's what separates him from the rest.

58:27.208 --> 58:29.000
That's how you become great.

58:29.583 --> 58:30.958
You think we can beat 'em, Dad?

58:31.625 --> 58:32.916
We're not only gonna beat 'em,

58:33.000 --> 58:35.583
we're gonna shut the scoreboard off.
How about that?

58:35.666 --> 58:36.583
Yeah, boys.

58:37.208 --> 58:38.291
Yeah!

58:39.416 --> 58:43.375
Last Saturday,
I saw a team get beat mentally!

58:44.958 --> 58:46.000
I saw guys quitting!

58:46.583 --> 58:48.958
I saw guys not at their physical best.

58:49.041 --> 58:51.291
So how do we bring that to the next level?

58:51.875 --> 58:52.916
I'll tell you how.

58:54.083 --> 58:56.458
We start running laps. Go!

59:03.083 --> 59:07.791
He wasn't talking about me quitting
and not being my physical best, was he?

59:08.666 --> 59:11.250
He wasn't,
but a couple of laps wouldn't hurt.

59:29.916 --> 59:34.166
Let's go. Get in there. Get in there.
Line it up. Let's go. Who wants it now?

59:36.916 --> 59:37.833
Yeah!

59:37.916 --> 59:40.333
Again! Harder!
You knock him in the dirt!

59:41.541 --> 59:44.291
Paulie, put the pizza down.
That's not your physical best.

59:44.375 --> 59:45.666
Listen up, guys.

59:46.458 --> 59:49.875
We need to address our weakest link,
which is our kicking game.

59:49.958 --> 59:52.750
-My butt hurts, man.
-It's because of Harlan's girlfriend.

59:52.833 --> 59:54.208
She's not my girlfriend.

59:54.291 --> 59:56.625
-Tell her not to come.
-You need to focus, man.

59:59.416 --> 1:00:01.208
Hey, hey, hey, cut it out.

1:00:01.291 --> 1:00:05.375
Listen up. Harlan's your teammate. You're
all gonna go through the same thing,

1:00:05.458 --> 1:00:08.458
so we need to help him
with his girlfriend problems.

1:00:08.541 --> 1:00:12.333
Guys, she's not my girlfriend.
She doesn't even know I exist.

1:00:12.416 --> 1:00:14.750
-Have you ever talked to this girl?
-I can't.

1:00:14.833 --> 1:00:17.250
I dropped out of chorus
the first day she joined.

1:00:17.333 --> 1:00:20.750
Aw, big loss.
Harlan's got the voice of an angel.

1:00:20.833 --> 1:00:22.125
I say stay away from her.

1:00:23.125 --> 1:00:24.958
-Oh God, not again.
-She'll break your heart.

1:00:25.041 --> 1:00:27.666
-Next thing, she's seeing some busboy.
-Mitch.

1:00:27.750 --> 1:00:30.291
-Then you're moving in with your mother.
-We talked about this.

1:00:30.375 --> 1:00:32.916
-M-M-Mitch, stop.
-And this kid's gonna kick my ass?

1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:33.875
Okay, Mitchell.

1:00:33.958 --> 1:00:36.916
-25 years old? H-How am I gonna fight him?
-Mitch, shut up.

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:40.416
I've got a bad hip and a back made
out of saltines, for crying out loud.

1:00:40.500 --> 1:00:41.333
Hey!

1:00:41.958 --> 1:00:45.708
Hey, Mitch, chill, man.
I'm setting you up with my twin sister.

1:00:45.791 --> 1:00:48.000
Guys, look, Harlan's our teammate, okay?

1:00:48.083 --> 1:00:50.083
He's got a problem.
We need to help him solve it.

1:00:50.666 --> 1:00:53.291
I mean, my mom likes it
when I make her breakfast in the morning.

1:00:53.375 --> 1:00:54.500
Make her breakfast.

1:00:54.583 --> 1:00:57.916
-I don't even know how to cook.
-But you do know how to sing.

1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.791
Trust me, this is gonna work.
Ladies, they love the lanterns.

1:01:01.875 --> 1:01:04.041
Had these left over
from my third wedding.

1:01:06.750 --> 1:01:08.583
Ah, I always have problems.

1:01:10.125 --> 1:01:11.625
Good luck, kid. Don't screw it up.

1:01:50.041 --> 1:01:50.958
Woo!

1:02:10.625 --> 1:02:11.791
Woo!

1:02:24.250 --> 1:02:25.375
Here she comes!

1:02:27.500 --> 1:02:29.291
What do you want?

1:02:30.333 --> 1:02:33.208
Wow, she's much older
than I thought she would be.

1:02:33.291 --> 1:02:36.416
I was sleepin'.
Do you know what time it is?

1:02:37.291 --> 1:02:38.833
It's like 7:30.

1:02:38.916 --> 1:02:41.833
Uh, hi. Is Brooke home?

1:02:41.916 --> 1:02:44.958
Wrong house, dummy.
It's across the street.

1:02:45.041 --> 1:02:47.208
Argh, fire!

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:51.833
Mom!

1:02:52.416 --> 1:02:55.083
Okay, guys, uh,
I think I'm gonna call it a night.

1:03:03.416 --> 1:03:09.791
-How are you gonna get to work tomorrow?
-I won't. I'll be fired, but I'll be okay.

1:03:12.125 --> 1:03:14.541
Well, at least she knows who you are now.

1:03:14.625 --> 1:03:16.083
Coming down there!

1:03:16.166 --> 1:03:18.500
-Yeah, boys.
-Yeah, yeah.

1:03:19.291 --> 1:03:22.708
There is excitement
in Argyle, Texas, today, boys.

1:03:23.333 --> 1:03:25.708
-Gentlemen. Amazing news.
-Hey, Jamie.

1:03:25.791 --> 1:03:27.458
Since I got fired
from the health food store

1:03:27.541 --> 1:03:29.083
for letting the cat sleep in the kale,

1:03:29.166 --> 1:03:31.208
I've been in the kitchen,
your old kitchen,

1:03:31.291 --> 1:03:33.583
perfecting my recipe
for the ultimate energy bar.

1:03:33.666 --> 1:03:35.583
-Okay.
-And today, I finally succeeded.

1:03:35.666 --> 1:03:39.291
Gentlemen, may I present to you
the Super Log.

1:03:39.916 --> 1:03:42.833
-Okay, great. Thank you.
-You mind if I hand 'em out to the boys?

1:03:42.916 --> 1:03:44.000
Great, Jamie. Go ahead.

1:03:44.083 --> 1:03:47.625
Hey, listen, guys. Wake up!
Come on over here. Everybody. Let's go.

1:03:47.708 --> 1:03:48.750
Come on.

1:03:48.833 --> 1:03:50.583
Now, we are one game away.

1:03:51.375 --> 1:03:53.500
One game away from the championship.

1:03:53.583 --> 1:03:55.916
I can't go out there and win it for you.

1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.250
Each and every one of you
has to do your job.

1:03:58.333 --> 1:04:00.708
Do your job and have fun.

1:04:03.375 --> 1:04:08.458
-Let's get on that bus. Let's go!
-Yeah!

1:04:08.541 --> 1:04:12.250
Super Log. Super Log.
Grab one, a Super Log.

1:04:12.833 --> 1:04:15.583
Uh, do you think I'll get in today, Coach?

1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:19.833
-Let me talk to Coach Payton about it.
-Okay.

1:04:19.916 --> 1:04:20.833
All right.

1:04:28.750 --> 1:04:30.958
<i>The Warriors</i>
<i>could win with a field goal,</i>

1:04:31.041 --> 1:04:33.583
<i>but Coach Payton has decided</i>
<i>to go for the touchdown.</i>

1:04:33.666 --> 1:04:36.083
<i>With a trip to the championship at stake,</i>

1:04:36.166 --> 1:04:38.458
<i>they'll have one final play</i>
<i>to secure their spot.</i>

1:04:46.875 --> 1:04:49.333
Ain't gonna score, boys.
Season's over for ya.

1:04:49.416 --> 1:04:51.958
That's what you think.
We're going to the champ--

1:04:52.041 --> 1:04:53.791
Ugh. Ew!

1:04:54.625 --> 1:04:56.041
Ew, dude!

1:05:00.208 --> 1:05:01.166
Time-out! Time-out!

1:05:01.250 --> 1:05:03.458
That's our last time-out!
What are you doin'?

1:05:07.416 --> 1:05:08.250
You okay, Paulie?

1:05:08.333 --> 1:05:10.500
-I am feeling better now that I hurled.
-Okay.

1:05:13.750 --> 1:05:15.666
Coach, I don't feel so--

1:05:17.083 --> 1:05:19.375
Ew, Marcos, that's so--

1:05:21.875 --> 1:05:23.291
What the hell is happening?

1:05:23.375 --> 1:05:25.000
Jamie's Power Logs.

1:05:25.083 --> 1:05:27.666
-Super Logs.
-How many of y'all had a Log?

1:05:32.958 --> 1:05:34.583
Oh, I forgot I had one.

1:05:34.666 --> 1:05:38.000
I don't know what the penalty is,
but I'm calling a forfeit.

1:05:38.083 --> 1:05:42.166
Don't forfeit. We are five yards away
from a championship game.

1:05:42.250 --> 1:05:44.291
-We are finishing this.
-They're all sick.

1:05:44.375 --> 1:05:47.458
Blue Delta Lightning! Let's go! Let's go!

1:06:26.333 --> 1:06:27.166
Ten!

1:06:54.416 --> 1:06:58.291
<i>Touchdown, Warriors!</i>
<i>Incredible victory!</i>

1:06:58.375 --> 1:07:01.250
<i>The Warriors have barfed their way</i>
<i>into the championship.</i>

1:07:15.041 --> 1:07:17.583
<i>The championship game is set.</i>

1:07:17.666 --> 1:07:20.208
<i>Warriors versus the Porcupines.</i>

1:07:37.666 --> 1:07:40.333
-Sean.How you holding up?
Been better, Coach.

1:07:40.416 --> 1:07:43.291
I can't hear you.
Are you in a tornado or something?

1:07:43.375 --> 1:07:47.083
Oh, no, no, it's a-a Jacuzzi filter
a-and a fan.

1:07:47.833 --> 1:07:51.708
Uh, look, um,
I-I'm coaching my son's team,

1:07:51.791 --> 1:07:55.625
and we-we're coming up against an offense
I've never seen before.

1:07:55.708 --> 1:07:57.125
Okay, what's it look like?

1:07:57.208 --> 1:08:00.458
They got four backs,
an unbalanced lineman, and it just--

1:08:00.541 --> 1:08:01.833
<i>Single wing.</i>

1:08:01.916 --> 1:08:05.375
The Steelers used to use this
as their base formation in their offense

1:08:05.458 --> 1:08:06.708
<i>up until the early '50s.</i>

1:08:06.791 --> 1:08:08.708
For the life of me, I can't figure it out.

1:08:08.791 --> 1:08:12.083
Easy. Take your wide receivers
and make them linebackers.

1:08:12.666 --> 1:08:14.833
-Okay.
-<i>This is not about skill set.</i>

1:08:14.916 --> 1:08:16.041
<i>It's about speed.</i>

1:08:16.125 --> 1:08:19.708
By the way, if you lose,
do not tell anybody that I helped you.

1:08:19.791 --> 1:08:21.916
-Yeah, I promise.
<i>Good.</i>

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:23.708
<i>The other thing</i>
<i>you have to focus on is this.</i>

1:08:23.791 --> 1:08:26.750
<i>You're taking offensive players</i>
<i>to defense…</i>

1:08:26.833 --> 1:08:29.333
Oh, I love that.
Okay, great. That's great.

1:08:39.375 --> 1:08:42.625
<i>And welcome</i>
<i>to the North Central Texas Championship,</i>

1:08:42.708 --> 1:08:46.958
<i>where today's matchup is against</i>
<i>the defending Springtown Porcupines</i>

1:08:47.041 --> 1:08:49.000
<i>and the Argyle Warriors.</i>

1:08:50.666 --> 1:08:51.916
Captains to the center.

1:08:52.416 --> 1:08:54.041
That's far enough. For the toss,

1:08:54.125 --> 1:08:57.958
we'll be using the North Central
Texas Championship commemorative coin.

1:08:58.041 --> 1:08:59.791
Warriors, call it in the air.

1:08:59.875 --> 1:09:00.750
Tails.

1:09:01.833 --> 1:09:04.125
-Tails it is. Kick or receive?
-Receive.

1:09:04.208 --> 1:09:06.791
Enjoy it. It's the only thing
you're gonna win all night.

1:09:06.875 --> 1:09:11.125
That's a good one. Do you have
a response? No? That's all right.

1:09:11.708 --> 1:09:12.875
And away we go.

1:09:15.708 --> 1:09:19.125
Remember the feeling you had
after we lost to these guys.

1:09:20.791 --> 1:09:23.250
A lot of times,
we don't get a shot at redemption.

1:09:24.166 --> 1:09:26.125
In the NFL, you lose to a team,

1:09:26.208 --> 1:09:28.166
you may not see them
for the rest of the season.

1:09:28.250 --> 1:09:30.541
You gotta carry that feeling
for another year.

1:09:31.291 --> 1:09:32.791
You guys earned this,

1:09:33.375 --> 1:09:36.833
and tonight we get to put that right
by showing them exactly who we are.

1:09:37.416 --> 1:09:38.375
Now, who are we?

1:09:38.458 --> 1:09:41.000
Warriors!

1:09:41.083 --> 1:09:42.958
Now, let's
shut that scoreboard down.

1:09:43.041 --> 1:09:45.666
-Let's go, boys. Game time!
-Get in there! Let's go!

1:09:45.750 --> 1:09:48.250
That got me. That got me.

1:09:48.333 --> 1:09:49.500
Uh, hey, uh,

1:09:50.458 --> 1:09:52.541
do you think Harlan could play tonight?

1:09:52.625 --> 1:09:54.958
-What?
-Well, he hasn't played in a while.

1:09:55.583 --> 1:09:58.666
I understand he's your bud and all,
but, uh, no, he-he sits.

1:10:02.083 --> 1:10:03.541
I got you, Payton!

1:10:03.625 --> 1:10:04.875
We about to eat!

1:10:05.458 --> 1:10:07.916
We about to eat good too!

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.416
Y'all ready? Y'all ready?
Let's do this! Let's do this! Come on!

1:10:28.916 --> 1:10:31.833
Here we go. Here we go.
Here we go. Get that ball.

1:10:34.625 --> 1:10:36.291
Marcos Gutierrez to return.

1:10:36.375 --> 1:10:37.875
-Come on!
-Run it! Run it!

1:10:39.291 --> 1:10:40.916
Yes! Yes!

1:10:41.416 --> 1:10:43.166
Hey! Hey!

1:10:43.250 --> 1:10:45.166
Here we go! Here we go!

1:10:45.250 --> 1:10:46.250
<i>To the 30.</i>

1:10:46.333 --> 1:10:47.500
<i>-To the 20.</i>
-Go!

1:10:47.583 --> 1:10:48.541
To the ten!

1:10:52.750 --> 1:10:55.083
-<i>Touchdown, Warriors!</i>
-Woo!

1:10:55.166 --> 1:10:57.208
Let's go! Yeah! Let's go. Come on!

1:10:57.291 --> 1:11:00.125
What a tremendous open for the Warriors.

1:11:00.208 --> 1:11:02.708
Okay! Okay. Okay, Payton!

1:11:03.416 --> 1:11:06.958
All right! Let's go, defense! D-D-D!

1:11:07.041 --> 1:11:08.791
Hey! That's what I'm talking about.

1:11:08.875 --> 1:11:11.166
Get in there.
Way to go, guys. Get it done.

1:11:11.250 --> 1:11:12.291
Here, listen up.

1:11:12.375 --> 1:11:15.250
Okay, when we get out there,
we're gonna be in a 3-4.

1:11:15.333 --> 1:11:17.041
But, Jason, I had an idea for you.

1:11:17.125 --> 1:11:18.666
I know how to attack this offense.

1:11:18.750 --> 1:11:21.958
Okay? What they're running
is called a "single wing." And we gotta--

1:11:22.041 --> 1:11:23.666
Aren't you running the offense now?

1:11:23.750 --> 1:11:25.291
I can do both. Here's the deal.

1:11:25.375 --> 1:11:28.083
To beat the single wing,
we gotta do this with speed.

1:11:28.166 --> 1:11:31.208
We're gonna take our two fastest players,
Connor and Marcos,

1:11:31.291 --> 1:11:33.125
and we're gonna put you guys
as defensive ends--

1:11:33.208 --> 1:11:35.666
Uh, uh, I thought
I was the defensive lineb--

1:11:35.750 --> 1:11:38.875
You were. Okay? You're not now.
We gotta be able to adjust, okay?

1:11:38.958 --> 1:11:41.000
-When did you come up with this?
-Last night.

1:11:41.083 --> 1:11:44.333
By myself. Layin' on my bed
in a crappy hotel, drinkin' a scotch.

1:11:44.416 --> 1:11:45.791
Okay, here it is.

1:11:45.875 --> 1:11:50.083
Defensive ends, we're gonna send them all
with speed, speed, speed, okay? Let's go.

1:11:50.166 --> 1:11:51.291
Get it done.

1:11:51.375 --> 1:11:54.875
-So we're not on D anymore?
-I don't know what we're doing.

1:11:54.958 --> 1:11:57.875
Don't you think you have your hands full
with the offense?

1:11:57.958 --> 1:12:00.875
Listen, this game is gonna be
either won or lost by defense.

1:12:00.958 --> 1:12:03.416
But I don't know how I feel
about sitting so many guys.

1:12:03.500 --> 1:12:04.958
I know exactly how I feel.

1:12:11.583 --> 1:12:13.333
Hey, what's goin' on?

1:12:15.875 --> 1:12:16.750
Hike!

1:12:21.791 --> 1:12:24.000
That's my boy! Okay, get 'em, okay!

1:12:24.791 --> 1:12:25.666
Yeah!

1:12:25.750 --> 1:12:28.041
Oh, so you wanna make adjustments?

1:12:28.125 --> 1:12:29.208
I can adjust too.

1:12:29.291 --> 1:12:31.083
I'm an adjustable chair, baby.

1:12:31.166 --> 1:12:34.041
I'mma pull it back on you.
I'm reclining on you.

1:12:34.125 --> 1:12:36.000
You ain't never seen a La-Z-Boy like this.

1:12:38.750 --> 1:12:40.250
-Hut!

1:12:43.208 --> 1:12:44.750
-<i>Ball is loose!</i>
-Get on it!

1:12:47.458 --> 1:12:48.416
Yeah!

1:12:49.500 --> 1:12:51.875
-Warrior ball!
<i>And Warriors recover!</i>

1:12:52.500 --> 1:12:54.500
-That's right!
-That's how you play football!

1:12:54.583 --> 1:12:55.875
-Yeah, Connor!
-Yes!

1:12:56.833 --> 1:12:57.958
You seeing this, Ronald?

1:12:58.041 --> 1:12:59.791
All right, good stuff, team. Good stuff!

1:12:59.875 --> 1:13:03.166
There you guys go. Way to go.
What are you guys doing? Get out there.

1:13:03.250 --> 1:13:05.041
Wait, Marcos and I are on offense too?

1:13:05.125 --> 1:13:07.666
Yeah, offense and defense.
Let's go. Come on.

1:13:12.666 --> 1:13:14.666
All right, everyone! Let's go! Let's go!

1:13:17.791 --> 1:13:19.625
3-8-8. Set!

1:13:21.916 --> 1:13:24.333
-<i>Brian drops back.</i>

1:13:24.833 --> 1:13:25.916
He airs it out to Payton.

1:13:27.666 --> 1:13:30.458
<i>Who hauls it in.</i>
<i>Touchdown, Warriors!</i>

1:13:31.791 --> 1:13:33.333
There we go! There we go!

1:13:33.416 --> 1:13:35.500
What was that?

1:13:35.583 --> 1:13:36.875
<i>And just like that,</i>

1:13:36.958 --> 1:13:39.666
<i>the Warriors take</i>
<i>an early two-touchdown lead.</i>

1:13:43.208 --> 1:13:44.291
Blue 88.

1:13:44.375 --> 1:13:46.291
I'm comin' for you! I'm comin' for you!

1:13:46.375 --> 1:13:49.125
<i>The Porcupines</i>
<i>will try to capitalize in the red zone</i>

1:13:49.208 --> 1:13:51.041
<i>and put some points on the board.</i>

1:13:51.125 --> 1:13:54.041
<i>It's a handoff to Bunche.</i>
<i>Oh, he jukes a defender.</i>

1:13:54.125 --> 1:13:55.916
<i>-Touchdown Porcupines.</i>
What I'm talking about.

1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:58.541
They can't hold you! They can't hold you!

1:13:58.625 --> 1:14:01.833
They can't hold him!
They can't hold him! They can't hold him!

1:14:01.916 --> 1:14:04.041
You can't hold him!

1:14:06.750 --> 1:14:08.083
Set, hut!

1:14:11.333 --> 1:14:13.500
<i>Another throw</i>
<i>from Brian to Connor.</i>

1:14:13.583 --> 1:14:15.125
<i>Touchdown, Warriors!</i>

1:14:15.875 --> 1:14:18.375
<i>Neither team ready</i>
<i>to take their foot off the gas.</i>

1:14:18.458 --> 1:14:19.625
<i>We head to the second quarter.</i>

1:14:27.583 --> 1:14:29.708
Sean Payton is runnin' these kids ragged.

1:14:29.791 --> 1:14:32.125
<i>And with just seven seconds</i>
<i>left in the half,</i>

1:14:32.208 --> 1:14:35.958
<i>the Porcupines will have one last shot</i>
<i>at the end zone to tighten the score.</i>

1:14:42.333 --> 1:14:44.208
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1:14:44.833 --> 1:14:47.250
<i>That's a touchdown</i>
<i>for the Porcupines.</i>

1:14:47.333 --> 1:14:48.875
Yes! You can't coach speed.

1:14:48.958 --> 1:14:51.666
You got all of halftime
to think about that one, Sean.

1:14:53.375 --> 1:14:55.291
<i>That'll do it</i>
<i>for the first half.</i>

1:14:55.375 --> 1:14:57.041
<i>For the first time all season,</i>

1:14:57.125 --> 1:14:59.000
the Porcupines are down.

1:14:59.083 --> 1:15:01.833
Warriors lead 18 to 17.

1:15:01.916 --> 1:15:05.333
Ronald is already celebrating
with his lucky halftime pickle.

1:15:10.416 --> 1:15:11.791
We're looking good.

1:15:11.875 --> 1:15:14.208
You can be sure
they're gonna make adjustments.

1:15:14.291 --> 1:15:16.416
So we need to be ready.

1:15:16.500 --> 1:15:20.000
-I'm tired, Coach.
-That happens when you put the work in.

1:15:20.083 --> 1:15:23.083
-You're gonna get tired. Suck it up.
-I'm exhausted too, Dad.

1:15:23.708 --> 1:15:25.708
Why can't Nate and Jason
get back on defense, Coach?

1:15:25.791 --> 1:15:28.958
'Cause sometimes you need to sacrifice
for the good of the team, Dennis.

1:15:29.041 --> 1:15:30.750
Yeah, right.

1:15:31.833 --> 1:15:32.791
I'm sorry?

1:15:32.875 --> 1:15:36.541
You never sacrifice for anyone.
You make everyone else sacrifice for you.

1:15:39.166 --> 1:15:42.000
Settle down there, son.
Listen, Brian. I want you to--

1:15:42.083 --> 1:15:43.375
You're yelling at everybody

1:15:43.458 --> 1:15:45.583
and won't let anybody listen
to Coach Troy.

1:15:46.125 --> 1:15:49.875
-You haven't let Harlan play in weeks.
-I'm trying to win a championship.

1:15:49.958 --> 1:15:51.333
Just so you don't look bad.

1:15:52.083 --> 1:15:55.583
Ever since you got embarrassed on ESPN,
you've been riding all of us.

1:15:55.666 --> 1:15:59.291
-I thought this was supposed to be fun.
-W-Was it fun losin' every week?

1:15:59.375 --> 1:16:00.666
Was that fun?

1:16:00.750 --> 1:16:02.416
It was more fun than this.

1:16:02.500 --> 1:16:05.958
Hey, if you're not having fun,
you're welcome to ride the bench. Okay?

1:16:07.250 --> 1:16:11.250
So you're just gonna bench the whole team
then? What is your problem?

1:16:11.333 --> 1:16:13.083
I am here trying to make this work!

1:16:18.041 --> 1:16:20.166
You're only here 'cause you got suspended.

1:16:30.625 --> 1:16:32.541
Okay, guys, that's halftime.

1:16:33.833 --> 1:16:38.500
Ooh, no, no, my bad. We got another five…
Seven minutes. Another seven minutes.

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:42.500
That's okay. Let's just…
Let's… let's go now.

1:17:06.958 --> 1:17:08.083
Fourth down!

1:17:19.125 --> 1:17:21.666
<i>And Connor Payton</i>
<i>goes down hard.</i>

1:17:22.291 --> 1:17:24.333
<i>No gain on the fourth down.</i>

1:17:24.416 --> 1:17:28.083
<i>And the Porcupines will take over</i>
<i>at their own 35-yard line.</i>

1:17:33.375 --> 1:17:36.333
Hey, you remember
what you told me that night?

1:17:36.416 --> 1:17:39.000
You said you didn't want
a whistle around your neck

1:17:39.083 --> 1:17:41.083
because you didn't think
Connor would like it.

1:17:42.500 --> 1:17:43.333
Yeah.

1:17:46.583 --> 1:17:48.666
I know you don't wanna be right.

1:18:12.791 --> 1:18:13.791
Hey, you two.

1:18:14.541 --> 1:18:15.958
You guys take a break.

1:18:16.041 --> 1:18:20.125
Nate, Jason, get back in
on defense. Let's go.

1:18:23.541 --> 1:18:25.791
We're playing
in the championship game, Nate.

1:18:25.875 --> 1:18:28.833
-This is awesome!
-I know. I'm terrified!

1:18:31.125 --> 1:18:33.208
<i>We are deep</i>
<i>in this fourth quarter.</i>

1:18:33.291 --> 1:18:36.208
This next field goal should put it
out of reach for the Warriors.

1:18:41.833 --> 1:18:44.750
<i>There's the snap.</i>
<i>The hold. The kick.</i>

1:18:45.583 --> 1:18:46.625
Yes!

1:18:47.416 --> 1:18:48.875
-And it's blocked!
-Yes!

1:18:49.708 --> 1:18:52.333
<i>First down, Warriors!</i>

1:18:53.791 --> 1:18:54.916
Attaboy, Nate.

1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:58.000
Hey, hey, hey. You ready, big man?

1:18:58.083 --> 1:19:00.208
The question is, are <i>they</i> ready?

1:19:00.291 --> 1:19:01.125
All right!

1:19:01.916 --> 1:19:05.416
All right, hey, hey, hey! Come here.
Listen, trips right, red seven.

1:19:06.166 --> 1:19:07.708
-What?
-All right.

1:19:08.666 --> 1:19:10.166
Grande burrito with everything.

1:19:10.250 --> 1:19:11.541
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah!

1:19:13.166 --> 1:19:17.833
<i>Go team, go! Go team, go!</i>

1:19:19.125 --> 1:19:21.416
Grande burrito. Grande burrito!

1:19:25.291 --> 1:19:26.166
Hike!

1:19:30.416 --> 1:19:32.083
Come on, Dennis!

1:19:37.166 --> 1:19:38.791
-Yes. Yes!
-Go!

1:19:42.250 --> 1:19:43.583
Keep going!

1:19:51.041 --> 1:19:51.875
Yes!

1:19:58.416 --> 1:19:59.458
Yeah!

1:19:59.541 --> 1:20:01.625
That's my baby! That's my boy!

1:20:05.458 --> 1:20:08.958
Thanks for getting me where I needed to be
on this journey. I will never forget you.

1:20:09.958 --> 1:20:11.125
All right, all right!

1:20:11.208 --> 1:20:15.291
Hey, we got time for one more play.
Green Stick Lookie! Let's finish this!

1:20:22.958 --> 1:20:25.458
It's Wildcat! Wildcat!

1:20:43.708 --> 1:20:45.958
T-T-Time-out! Change of play!

1:20:47.375 --> 1:20:48.458
Hey, hey, hey!

1:20:48.958 --> 1:20:50.250
Field goal unit.

1:20:50.333 --> 1:20:51.500
What?

1:20:51.583 --> 1:20:53.208
You realize that's just gonna tie.

1:20:53.291 --> 1:20:56.666
Yeah. That's right. Harlan.
Harlan. Come on. Get in here.

1:20:57.333 --> 1:20:59.750
Hey, hey, I thought
we earned it. Redemption.

1:20:59.833 --> 1:21:01.541
Yeah, that's what I'm doin'.

1:21:06.250 --> 1:21:07.458
Are you sure, Dad?

1:21:07.541 --> 1:21:10.333
Yeah. Last game of the season.
Everybody plays.

1:21:10.916 --> 1:21:12.958
Come on. Get in there. Get in there.

1:21:14.583 --> 1:21:17.208
All right, boys.
Let's do our field goal.

1:21:19.541 --> 1:21:20.458
I can't believe it.

1:21:20.541 --> 1:21:23.916
Sean Payton, down three,
has decided to go for the tie

1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:27.041
with a field goal kicker
that hasn't made one all season.

1:21:28.875 --> 1:21:29.708
Wow.

1:21:33.333 --> 1:21:36.250
Come on, let's go. Let's make this happen.

1:21:40.791 --> 1:21:42.583
Let's go, Harlan!

1:22:10.375 --> 1:22:12.875
Why is my stepdaughter
blowing that kid a kiss?

1:22:18.208 --> 1:22:19.333
Hut.

1:22:19.416 --> 1:22:21.333
Snap is back. The ball is down.

1:22:26.958 --> 1:22:27.791
The kick is up.

1:22:30.333 --> 1:22:31.375
<i>It's goin'.</i>

1:22:32.833 --> 1:22:34.333
<i>It's goin' wide.</i>

1:22:34.916 --> 1:22:36.333
<i>It's goin' very wide.</i>

1:22:36.916 --> 1:22:38.208
Oh my goodness. It's still goin'.

1:22:45.291 --> 1:22:47.041
No good.

1:22:48.458 --> 1:22:50.125
Yes! Yes!

1:22:57.166 --> 1:22:59.416
Oh, explosion!

1:23:18.541 --> 1:23:21.791
There is fireworks
in Argyle, Texas, tonight.

1:23:43.458 --> 1:23:45.125
We shut it down!

1:23:53.500 --> 1:23:54.333
What?

1:23:56.666 --> 1:23:58.291
Dennis! Yes, Dennis!

1:24:02.041 --> 1:24:03.666
Oh, this is such a great ending.

1:24:05.291 --> 1:24:09.208
The Porcupines have won the game, though,
just to be totally clear.

1:24:11.625 --> 1:24:15.791
Harlan! Harlan!
Harlan! Harlan! Harlan!

1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:51.208
Hey. Played a heck of a game.

1:24:51.291 --> 1:24:54.458
Yeah, and I coached it. Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1:24:54.541 --> 1:24:55.583
Ooh, baby!

1:24:57.625 --> 1:24:59.041
-How you feeling?
-I'm feeling good.

1:24:59.125 --> 1:25:00.500
-Yeah.
-I feel real good.

1:25:00.583 --> 1:25:03.041
Thank you, again,
for everything. Seriously.

1:25:03.125 --> 1:25:05.541
Hopefully, I'll have your playbook down
before next season.

1:25:06.041 --> 1:25:08.625
I'm sure if you don't,
Coach Mitch will have you covered.

1:25:10.125 --> 1:25:12.833
Oh! Looks like
he found his ride home.

1:25:12.916 --> 1:25:15.416
-Oh. You know he likes gumbo.

1:25:15.500 --> 1:25:18.916
Hey, listen, I wanted to thank you.
You've taught me so much this season.

1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:19.958
You really did.

1:25:20.041 --> 1:25:22.000
You keep coaching like this,
I promise you,

1:25:22.083 --> 1:25:25.916
you're gonna earn yourself one of these.
Try it on.

1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.625
Connor's dad is giving his Super Bowl ring
to Coach Troy.

1:25:28.708 --> 1:25:31.375
No. He's just tryin' it on.
He's borrowing it. That's all.

1:25:31.458 --> 1:25:35.541
That's all, guys. Hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Whoa, guys!

1:25:36.125 --> 1:25:37.875
-Awesome!
-Hey, come on.

1:25:54.083 --> 1:25:55.291
You take care, Eric.

1:25:55.916 --> 1:25:57.625
Oh, Mr. Payton, you're checking out?

1:25:58.125 --> 1:26:01.333
Uh, yeah. What gave it away?
The, uh, "take care" or the bag?

1:26:01.416 --> 1:26:04.250
Well, I hope
you enjoyed your stay here, and…

1:26:04.333 --> 1:26:06.791
Oh, wait. You gotta see this.

1:26:07.541 --> 1:26:08.625
Look, it's a boy!

1:26:09.291 --> 1:26:12.166
Whoa. Is… is that mid-birth?

1:26:12.250 --> 1:26:15.208
Isn't it beautiful?
That's his little head poking out.

1:26:15.291 --> 1:26:17.250
Wow. He… he looks just like you.

1:26:17.333 --> 1:26:21.166
Your wife might not appreciate you
showing that picture to a lot of people.

1:26:23.083 --> 1:26:24.250
Oh crap.

1:26:27.750 --> 1:26:30.541
Gotta say I was really impressed
with your speed this season.

1:26:30.625 --> 1:26:34.208
-Guessing you get that from your old man.
-Oh, definitely not.

1:26:34.791 --> 1:26:36.125
I think I get that from Mom.

1:26:36.625 --> 1:26:40.125
I get the soft hands from
Jamie. He makes his own lavender soap.

1:26:40.208 --> 1:26:41.666
Of course he does.

1:26:44.208 --> 1:26:45.583
Hey, I wanted to thank you.

1:26:47.250 --> 1:26:48.083
For what?

1:26:48.583 --> 1:26:50.416
Well, I wanted you to know that

1:26:50.916 --> 1:26:52.791
I-I needed you and the…

1:26:54.125 --> 1:26:56.250
and the team more than you guys needed me.

1:26:58.250 --> 1:26:59.083
Yeah, you did.

1:27:04.375 --> 1:27:05.583
I was talking to your mom.

1:27:05.666 --> 1:27:08.583
Thought maybe you comin' out
to New Orleans for some visits this year.

1:27:08.666 --> 1:27:10.375
-What do you think of that?
-For sure.

1:27:10.458 --> 1:27:13.250
-Okay.
-That'd be really fun. I'd love that.

1:27:13.333 --> 1:27:14.583
-All right.

1:27:15.083 --> 1:27:16.166
Can I go to games?

1:27:16.250 --> 1:27:19.500
That's what you're coming out there for.
You're not stayin' in my house!

1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.291
-You think I can meet Drew?
-Nah, he don't wanna meet you.

1:27:27.958 --> 1:27:29.333
We'll have some fun.

1:27:30.166 --> 1:27:32.791
-I love you, Connor.
-I love you too, Dad.

1:27:35.875 --> 1:27:38.458
I'm gonna need a scouting report
on every RB in the draft.

1:27:38.541 --> 1:27:41.375
And RB is Russell brouts?

1:27:41.875 --> 1:27:45.333
No, a running back,
and that's not how you say that vegetable.

1:27:45.416 --> 1:27:48.791
Oh. A-And we get
these scouting reports from…

1:27:48.875 --> 1:27:50.083
The scouting department.

1:27:51.083 --> 1:27:54.666
Wow! You're a lot more patient with me
after working with kids for a year.

1:27:54.750 --> 1:27:56.625
Yeah. Enjoy it while it lasts, Emma.

1:28:00.625 --> 1:28:02.875
-Lionel!
-Coach!

1:28:02.958 --> 1:28:05.000
-Good to have you back.
-It's good to be back.

1:28:05.083 --> 1:28:06.416
I missed you so much.

1:28:06.500 --> 1:28:07.916
Ah, I missed you too.

1:28:11.333 --> 1:28:12.750
We really suck without you.
