I've seen happier faces
on a school bus
going over a cliff.

14:33.373 --> 14:37.209
But they can't
stop looking, can they?

14:43.132 --> 14:45.634
Audiences want to
be shocked, Barney.

14:45.802 --> 14:50.013
They want something different,
and this is it.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.391
Every time you want to do
something different...

14:52.559 --> 14:56.478
like The Wrong Man
or Vertigo...

14:56.646 --> 14:57.729
someone loses money.

14:57.897 --> 15:01.066
So, we should stop trying
to give them something new?

15:01.234 --> 15:04.486
You owe Paramount
one last picture, Hitch.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.322
Now,
can't you do something
like North by Northwest...

15:07.490 --> 15:11.159
but for us this time,
instead of for MGM?

15:13.580 --> 15:14.746
Psycho.

15:19.002 --> 15:22.504
No one respects
the name "Hitchcock"
like Paramount.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.718
Are you telling
me "no," Barney?

15:28.678 --> 15:32.014
I think you know me
better than that, Hitch.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.434
LEW: What a putz.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.937
You know what his family did
before they built
those movie palaces?

15:39.105 --> 15:41.023
Ran a grocery store.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.900
My father ran
a grocery store.

15:45.361 --> 15:49.281
Exactly,
that's what I'm saying.
He should show some respect.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.201
They think I've
lost my touch, Lew.

15:54.454 --> 15:58.540
My association
with television
has cheapened me.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.250
Are you referring
to that deal I got you...

16:00.418 --> 16:02.878
where Bristol-Myers
pays you $29,000
an episode,

16:02.962 --> 16:04.463
and you own the negative?

16:04.631 --> 16:06.882
That's my kind of cheap.

16:07.050 --> 16:10.719
They just want the same thing
over and over and over.

16:10.887 --> 16:14.473
They've put me in a coffin,
and now they're nailing
down the lid.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.767
Hitch, as your agent...

16:16.934 --> 16:19.227
I will never let that happen.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.233
How much do you
think you can make
this picture for?

16:26.736 --> 16:29.237
$800,000, give or take.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.907
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

16:38.289 --> 16:40.123
You're home early.

16:41.584 --> 16:42.626
Oh!

16:43.503 --> 16:45.587
It's lovely, actually.

16:46.047 --> 16:47.255
Oh!

16:57.100 --> 17:01.520
You know, I'm disappointed
you didn't give
Whit's book a chance.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.606
And what about Whit?
Is he disappointed?

17:04.773 --> 17:06.608
No, he knows you well enough.

17:06.776 --> 17:07.776
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Look at that.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.112
Time for a new one, anyway.

17:10.696 --> 17:14.116
Well, you better
enjoy the pool, my dear,
while you can.

17:16.618 --> 17:19.454
We might not
have it much longer.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.373
Why?

17:21.540 --> 17:24.291
Paramount refuses
to finance the movie.

17:24.961 --> 17:27.212
Oh, Hitch, I'm so sorry.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.967
Lew can't find the money.
At least, not fast enough.

17:32.802 --> 17:34.678
Well, why not wait?

17:36.180 --> 17:37.305
No.

17:40.476 --> 17:44.312
We're just going to
have to go it alone,
old girl.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.358
Finance it ourselves.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.075
Well, are we going to
have to sell
the whole house,

17:57.160 --> 17:59.244
or just the pool?

18:00.496 --> 18:02.664
I just want to do the film.

18:09.672 --> 18:10.881
I'm going to
ask you this once,

18:10.965 --> 18:13.175
and I'll never
mention it again.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.011
Why this one, Hitch?

18:18.514 --> 18:21.892
It's not just because
so many people are
saying "no," is it?

18:24.020 --> 18:28.523
Do you remember the fun we
had when we started out
all those years ago?

18:29.442 --> 18:30.901
We didn't have any
money then, did we?

18:31.068 --> 18:32.861
We didn't have
any time, either.

18:33.029 --> 18:35.197
But we took risks,
do you remember?

18:37.408 --> 18:38.450
We experimented.

18:38.618 --> 18:43.789
We invented new ways
of making pictures...

18:44.707 --> 18:46.875
because we had to.

18:49.754 --> 18:50.921
I just want to feel...

18:51.088 --> 18:55.717
that kind of... freedom again.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.430
Like we used to, you know?

19:07.522 --> 19:12.776
We are about to propose
a restructured
deal for Psycho.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.945
I'm listening.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.531
We finance it.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.866
Independently.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.993
Hitch waives his
directorial fee...

19:22.245 --> 19:25.205
Paramount only
distributes it...

19:25.373 --> 19:28.166
in exchange for
40% of the profits.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.460
BARNEY: Interesting.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.421
But what exactly
is Paramount distributing?

19:34.215 --> 19:36.508
Is this still
a picture about a queer

19:36.592 --> 19:38.844
killing people in
his mother's dress?

19:39.011 --> 19:42.389
LEW: What this picture is
about is the reputation
of Alfred Hitchcock.

19:42.557 --> 19:43.723
BARNEY:
No one is arguing that.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.141
Barney...

19:46.143 --> 19:47.894
it's very simple.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.314
This is Mister Hitchcock's
next film.

19:52.275 --> 19:56.319
Are you in, or are you out?

20:02.118 --> 20:03.285
Fine.

20:04.078 --> 20:06.371
We'll take that deal...

20:07.915 --> 20:09.916
if you can get the money.

20:10.668 --> 20:13.837
We already have
the money, Barney.

20:20.344 --> 20:23.638
Who do I make it out to?

20:28.728 --> 20:31.938
If this picture
fails, Alma...

20:32.106 --> 20:37.611
we'll be in for a long,
humiliating bout
of crow-eating.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.531
It will be splendid.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.326
Are you sure?

20:44.493 --> 20:47.454
Of the movie?
Not at all.

20:49.624 --> 20:53.418
But of you, unquestionably.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.927
PEGGY: Ahem.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.680
Joe Stefano.
Good to meet you.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.557
Sit down.
I'm sorry I was late.

21:07.725 --> 21:09.643
My shrink session
went overtime.

21:13.356 --> 21:16.274
I see him every day.
It's still not enough.
(DOOR CLOSES)

21:16.442 --> 21:19.945
I thought it was only
director's assistants
who needed psychiatrists.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.613
Not writers.

21:21.697 --> 21:23.031
(CHUCKLES)

21:26.994 --> 21:29.037
Do you see a shrink,
Mister Hitchcock?

21:29.205 --> 21:31.665
I have to confess,
Mister Stefano...

21:31.832 --> 21:33.708
it boggles my brain
just trying to imagine...

21:33.876 --> 21:35.502
what on earth
you and your shrink

21:35.586 --> 21:38.421
could possibly
talk about every day.

21:40.716 --> 21:41.841
Just the usual.

21:42.009 --> 21:45.345
Sex, rage, my mother.

21:55.022 --> 21:57.023
Good morning.
Good morning, sir.

21:59.735 --> 22:00.777
Let me have a look at you.

22:00.945 --> 22:03.697
You know, the only thing worse
than a visit to the dentist...

22:03.864 --> 22:05.407
is a visit to the censor.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.827
Whatever you do, Hitch,
don't lose your temper.

22:10.538 --> 22:12.247
See you later.
Good luck.

22:13.416 --> 22:14.666
Thank you.
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

22:15.251 --> 22:17.293
GEOFFREY: The code
will absolutely not
permit you

22:17.378 --> 22:21.589
to show a knife
penetrating a woman's flesh.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.550
I assure you, Geoffrey...

22:23.718 --> 22:28.596
my murders are always models
of taste and discretion.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.599
Is there any
improper suggestion
of nudity...

22:31.767 --> 22:34.602
in this murder scene
in the shower?

22:34.979 --> 22:39.566
She won't be nude,
she'll be wearing
a shower cap.

22:40.901 --> 22:42.068
Hmm...

22:44.280 --> 22:47.115
We might accept a shot
from outside
the bathroom window...

22:47.283 --> 22:49.659
of Marion in silhouette,
above the shoulders...

22:49.827 --> 22:52.537
provided that
the glass is frosted.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.581
Thank you.

22:54.999 --> 22:56.124
GEOFFREY: And...

22:57.001 --> 22:59.377
this scene with a toilet.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.713
Well,
it is completely necessary
to show the toilet...

23:01.881 --> 23:04.966
because Marion Crane
attempts to flush
evidence down it.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.136
Remnants of which
are later discovered
by her sister.

23:08.304 --> 23:12.974
These remnants,
you understand,
are clues to her vanishing.

23:14.477 --> 23:19.064
No American movie has ever
found it necessary
to show a toilet...

23:19.231 --> 23:21.483
let alone to flush one.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.486
Well, perhaps
we ought to shoot
the film in France.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.488
Use a bidet instead.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.285
Mister Hitchcock...

23:33.120 --> 23:35.163
if this office
denies you a seal...

23:35.331 --> 23:37.999
and we're certainly heading
in that direction...

23:38.167 --> 23:39.959
your movie will
not be released

23:40.044 --> 23:42.420
in a single theater
in this country.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.174
Will you be making jokes then?

23:48.803 --> 23:51.971
HITCHCOCK: Everyone in
Hollywood resents me.

23:52.598 --> 23:54.682
I make them
millions of dollars...

23:54.850 --> 23:59.604
and every year I sit at those
dreadful award show dinners...

23:59.772 --> 24:02.148
waiting for someone
just to say...

24:02.608 --> 24:04.025
"You're good."

24:06.028 --> 24:10.824
They take sadistic pleasure
in denying me that
one little moment.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.201
MAN: That must hurt.

24:16.205 --> 24:17.831
Deeply, Ed.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.708
Deeply.

24:21.544 --> 24:23.336
I'm sorry, but...

24:25.005 --> 24:27.715
I'm just not used to this...

24:28.175 --> 24:29.676
process.

24:31.387 --> 24:34.722
ED: Just think of me
more like a friend.

24:34.890 --> 24:38.560
It's just that more and more,
I've been having these...

24:39.145 --> 24:40.311
impulses.

24:45.151 --> 24:47.694
ED: What kind of impulses?

24:53.242 --> 24:55.410
Strong ones.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.263
Here.

25:16.432 --> 25:19.225
The Lazar office tells me
he's crazy to work with you.

25:19.393 --> 25:20.852
Well, tell Swifty Lazar
he should not have

25:20.936 --> 25:22.937
overexposed his
client on television.

25:23.105 --> 25:25.607
Unlike some we could mention.

25:28.402 --> 25:29.611
Anthony Perkins.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.237
Oh.

25:31.572 --> 25:34.699
Think of the duality
he could bring
to the role of Norman.

25:34.867 --> 25:37.243
The rage lurking beneath
that little boy grin...

25:37.411 --> 25:40.872
the winsome charm he uses
to keep from being
(WHISPERS) found out.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.123
PEGGY: Why, Alma.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.542
You're not suggesting
Mister Perkins is...

25:45.628 --> 25:46.836
Mmm-hmm.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.256
What?

25:56.305 --> 25:57.972
I like your office.

26:01.477 --> 26:05.647
I can't count
how many times I've
seen Strangers on a Train.

26:06.482 --> 26:07.982
And Rope.

26:09.318 --> 26:12.403
Well, Norman Bates is
the logical extension

26:12.488 --> 26:14.405
of those two characters
in that movie.

26:14.740 --> 26:16.616
Appealing, sensitive...

26:16.784 --> 26:19.744
suffering the terrible
burden of being forced

26:19.828 --> 26:22.830
to pretend to be
something he is not.

26:25.626 --> 26:27.543
Well, I'm sick of
all this romantic crap

26:27.628 --> 26:29.671
the studios keep
shoving me into.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.173
But my only worry is...

26:33.092 --> 26:36.302
Well, playing Norman
might cut too close to home.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.180
How so?

26:39.640 --> 26:40.723
Uh...

26:42.351 --> 26:44.686
When I was younger...

26:45.187 --> 26:48.022
I was incredibly
close to my mother.

26:49.191 --> 26:53.945
So close that I remember
wishing my father
would drop dead.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.699
And when I was five,
he did just that.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.536
He keeled over
from a heart attack.

27:08.544 --> 27:12.380
You see, I've been
guilty my whole life,
Mister Hitchcock.

27:17.886 --> 27:20.555
You know,
I'm getting blisters
just watching you.

27:20.723 --> 27:22.015
Oh, stop complaining.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.183
A bit of fresh air
and exercise will
do you good.

27:25.060 --> 27:26.394
I'm going to have a drink.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.563
No, you're not.
You're going to
finish that hedge.

27:28.731 --> 27:30.815
You've got to go all
the way around there,
all the way around there.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.066
That's impossible.
I can't do that.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.234
Yes, you can.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.905
You know, I was thinking...

27:38.073 --> 27:40.783
if I could get Grace Kelly
to play the girl...

27:40.951 --> 27:43.202
they'd let me get
away with murder.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.204
Well, you can't.
She's a princess now,

27:45.289 --> 27:46.956
which makes her
permanently unattainable.

27:47.124 --> 27:49.459
And all the more desirable.

27:49.626 --> 27:51.044
How about Deborah Kerr?

27:51.211 --> 27:52.754
Lew mentioned her.

27:53.047 --> 27:54.964
No, she's too Scottish.

27:56.759 --> 27:58.426
How about Janet Leigh?

27:59.219 --> 28:00.803
I know she's normally
the good girl,

28:00.888 --> 28:03.306
but she was awfully
good in Touch of Evil.

28:03.474 --> 28:05.683
You remember how
you always used to remark

28:05.768 --> 28:08.269
on her figure at
the Wasserman's parties?

28:09.355 --> 28:10.730
Yeah.

28:16.945 --> 28:17.987
Good evening.

28:18.072 --> 28:19.822
Hello. Lovely to see you.

28:19.990 --> 28:21.324
Charmed.
Hi.

28:21.492 --> 28:22.909
Hello, Janet.
How are you again?

28:22.993 --> 28:24.369
Wonderful to see you.

28:24.912 --> 28:26.829
Well, my dear,
you're looking
very beautiful.

28:26.997 --> 28:28.164
Thank you.

28:28.624 --> 28:30.249
Very beautiful.

28:34.797 --> 28:37.632
Of course, the real secret
of Mrs. Simpson's appeal

28:37.716 --> 28:38.800
to the Duke of Windsor...

28:38.967 --> 28:42.929
was that she
could make a toothpick
feel like a cigar.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.138
(LAUGHS)

28:45.432 --> 28:47.934
I've been so immersed
in preparing to play Marion,

28:48.018 --> 28:49.811
I'd almost forgotten
how to laugh.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.229
Oh, really?
Yes.

28:51.397 --> 28:54.232
Well, now you must try
the banana shortcake.

28:54.400 --> 28:57.652
Oh, no,
nothing for me, thank you.
I'm watching my figure.

28:57.820 --> 29:00.446
Yes, you're not the only one.
We're fine, thank you.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.156
George, bring her
the banana shortcake.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.867
In fact, make that
two large portions.

29:04.952 --> 29:05.993
Thank you.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.078
Now, tell me, my dear,

29:07.162 --> 29:09.872
how else have you prepared
for the part of Marion Crane?

29:10.040 --> 29:12.417
Well, I've written
an entire history for her...

29:12.584 --> 29:15.962
which seems
a little silly, I know,
but it really does help.

29:16.130 --> 29:17.588
It doesn't sound
silly at all.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.798
No?

29:18.882 --> 29:22.885
Why don't you tell us
one of her deepest secrets?

29:24.763 --> 29:26.639
Well, she leads a double life.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.394
At the Lowery office,
she wears Tweed perfume.

29:31.562 --> 29:33.729
But when she's with Sam...

29:33.897 --> 29:38.359
she recklessly breaks out
her most expensive bottle.

29:38.527 --> 29:41.237

Yes.

29:45.617 --> 29:48.202

a concern or two.

29:48.370 --> 29:49.954

I'm an actress, of course,

29:50.038 --> 29:52.457

a wife and a mother.

29:52.624 --> 29:55.751
And I'm just
curious to know...

29:55.919 --> 29:58.463
how are you going to shoot
this shower scene?

29:58.630 --> 30:01.132
Yes, you and the
Shurlock Office.

30:01.300 --> 30:06.012
It's only that,
well, from here up,
I'm not exactly boyish, so...

30:06.680 --> 30:09.557
Allow me to set
your mind at rest,
my dear.

30:09.850 --> 30:13.436
I will be shooting
short bits of film
from various angles.

30:13.604 --> 30:15.938
Cut together,
the montage will only

30:16.023 --> 30:18.858
suggest nudity,
suggest violence.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.152
Nothing will
actually be shown.

30:22.404 --> 30:25.198
But of course,
having you
in the shower...

30:25.365 --> 30:27.909
will make it all
that more, well...

We'll have to find
other places to cut.

why I'm watching

37:45.889 --> 37:47.723
I feel I should
take offense at that.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.935
Perhaps Norman
secretly watched
his mother

37:51.019 --> 37:52.895
preparing for her
nightly bath.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.774

over the bathroom door.

44:38.760 --> 44:41.178
I thought you could use
a little pick-me-up.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.471
Oh! You're so sweet.
Thank you.

44:42.555 --> 44:43.597
Not at all.

44:43.765 --> 44:45.766
Here, have a seat.
Thanks.

44:46.642 --> 44:48.518
I can't imagine
your husband would
be too pleased

44:48.603 --> 44:50.437
with what just happened.

44:50.605 --> 44:52.439
Well, you know...

44:52.857 --> 44:54.441
with Tony and the kids,
you'd be surprised

44:54.525 --> 44:55.984
what comes out
of their mouths sometimes.

44:56.152 --> 44:57.611
(LAUGHS) That's true.

44:59.113 --> 45:02.157
You haven't spoken
to him much about your
personal life, have you?

45:02.450 --> 45:03.575
Hitch?
Mm-hmm.

45:03.743 --> 45:05.660
No. Not really.

45:06.662 --> 45:09.623
I would keep it that
way if I were you.

45:13.753 --> 45:14.753
Why?

45:15.797 --> 45:18.340
Well, it starts
with him wanting to
choose your hairstyle.

45:18.508 --> 45:20.300
Then, he wants to
choose your clothes...

45:20.468 --> 45:23.637
and your friends,
and how many children
you should have.

45:25.264 --> 45:27.224
You know that poor,
tortured soul

45:27.308 --> 45:29.643
Jimmy Stewart
played in Vertigo?
Hmm.

45:29.811 --> 45:31.478
That's Hitch.

45:32.480 --> 45:34.856
Only younger, slimmer
and better-looking.

45:35.024 --> 45:36.983
Well, I don't know.

45:37.151 --> 45:39.319
Compared to Orson Welles,
he's a sweetheart.

Yeah?

46:32.248 --> 46:33.290
How long is
this going to take?

46:33.374 --> 46:34.374
Give me five minutes.

I haven't got all day.

burning out all the time?

46:39.005 --> 46:41.548

So what's the hold-up?

46:41.716 --> 46:42.674
It's still engaged.

46:42.758 --> 46:43.842
All right,
give it to me,
I'll try it.

46:44.010 --> 46:45.385
Here, I've dialed.
Hitch.

46:45.553 --> 46:46.678
I'm stuck on
Lila's first scene.

46:46.846 --> 46:49.222
I don't know how strongly
I should confront Sam
and the detective...

You know how to do that. Act.

to carry a light stand?

Hilton!

47:02.778 --> 47:03.987
I'll take care of
it right away, Mr. Hitchcock.

47:04.071 --> 47:05.363
It makes all the difference
when the money's

47:05.448 --> 47:06.781
coming out of your
own pocket, doesn't it?

(LAUGHS) Right.

47:08.910 --> 47:10.911
I'll make
reservations for 1:30.

47:11.078 --> 47:14.206
Oh, Whit. What would
I do without you?

47:15.333 --> 47:17.375
Until then, bye-bye.

47:30.890 --> 47:37.938
Whit?

48:00.628 --> 48:02.128
Mister Hitchcock,
sir, please.
No, no.

48:02.296 --> 48:03.713
Every press outlet
is dying for photos.

48:03.798 --> 48:05.131
If we could just
get one photo...

48:05.299 --> 48:09.135
Get off my set!
I'll have security...
Get off my set. Just go.

48:09.303 --> 48:12.472
Get rid of this man.
He's a bloody pest.
Get him off the set, now.

48:12.640 --> 48:13.890
Are you okay?
You've gone very pale.

48:13.975 --> 48:15.225
I told you to get away.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.811
Stop following me
around like a puppy dog
and get me a drink.

48:17.979 --> 48:19.062
It's not even three!

48:19.146 --> 48:20.814
Then give me the key
to the cabinet.

48:25.278 --> 48:28.113
Hello, Hitch.
How's the picture?

48:28.281 --> 48:29.990
I'm hearing
interesting things.

48:30.157 --> 48:31.992
It's a miracle anyone
can hear anything...

48:32.159 --> 48:35.245
above the noise coming from
Geoffrey Shurlock's office.

48:35.413 --> 48:38.415
You know,
I shouldn't be in a position
of just hearing things, Hitch.

48:38.583 --> 48:39.749
It's time you showed
me some footage.

48:39.834 --> 48:41.001
Why?

48:41.669 --> 48:43.086
To see if you're
making a picture

48:43.170 --> 48:44.838
Paramount can
actually release.

48:45.006 --> 48:46.339
As you well know...

48:46.507 --> 48:49.843
my contract
guarantees me final cut.

48:50.011 --> 48:51.678
Your contract also says...

48:51.846 --> 48:53.680
Paramount isn't
required to distribute

48:53.764 --> 48:55.974
any film that could
cause us embarrassment.

48:56.142 --> 48:59.603
Unlike the last five
Martin and Lewis films
you're all so proud of.

48:59.770 --> 49:01.646
I demand to see some footage!

49:01.814 --> 49:02.856

the same thing.

Well, I can give you
a ride if you'd like.

49:57.870 --> 50:00.747
HITCHCOCK: Oh, my God.
What a tiny car.
Mmm-hmm.

50:01.040 --> 50:03.249
What are these things?
I keep looking at them,
what are they?

50:03.417 --> 50:05.043
Candy corn.
Girls love them.

50:05.211 --> 50:06.336
Candy corn.

50:06.504 --> 50:08.922
I nicked them from
Tony's dressing room.

50:09.006 --> 50:10.423
Oh.
Mmm-hmm.

50:10.508 --> 50:11.758

Did you know,
before we got together,
I was his boss?

50:41.539 --> 50:43.456
He had to work his way
up to Assistant Director

50:43.541 --> 50:44.958
before he dared ask me out.

going to play
the lead in Vertigo.

filming, she told me
she was pregnant, and...

51:51.192 --> 51:54.152
I was going to make
her into a star...

51:54.320 --> 51:58.490
but she chose the life
of a housewife instead.

I wonder?

56:26.717 --> 56:27.800

First of all,
the plot's a bit of
a muddle, isn't it?

jokes are awfully

so much better...

and the hero...

So, what's the verdict?
(SIGHS)

01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:34.636
Let's just say it was
a four-letter review,
and it wasn't "good."

01:14:36.889 --> 01:14:37.889
Screw him!

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:42.352
It's too late for
Paramount to back out,
no matter what Balaban says.

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:46.523
You know, the other
route is to recut it

01:14:46.607 --> 01:14:48.525
as a two-parter
for the TV series.

01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:51.027
Because of the budget
and the Hitchcock name,

01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:53.238
we stand a good
chance of breaking even.

01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:59.911

a millionaire
on winchester '73.

01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:16.446

working with you.

Well, there's no
other way of saying it,
is there?

01:17:07.707 --> 01:17:10.542
It's stillborn.

01:17:16.007 --> 01:17:18.550
I let you down, my love.

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:25.890
You deserve better.

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:36.901

Geoffrey and Stanley.

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:42.741

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:05.263
Good boys.

01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.028
I don't think I
can stand us both
being maudlin.

01:19:04.115 --> 01:19:06.699
That tiresome little
Hitchcock imitation

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:09.327
I've been helping
Whit finish is done.

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:14.624
You know, there's
only one solution
to all this.

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:17.001
That we get back
to work together.

01:19:18.212 --> 01:19:21.172
The fact is, I rather like
living in this house.

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.133
So I suggest,
for everyone's sake,

01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:25.009
we start whipping
Psycho into shape.

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:30.390
You may not be
the easiest man
to live with...

01:19:30.558 --> 01:19:34.144
but you do know
how to cut a picture
better than anyone else.

01:19:38.232 --> 01:19:40.650
Except for you.

01:19:43.195 --> 01:19:46.030
The second take,
the light is much
better on the hands.

01:19:50.161 --> 01:19:52.745
Only cut back to Janet
once her car's already moving.

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:53.913
Cut it tighter.

01:19:58.085 --> 01:20:01.087
Oh, you imp.
You've got nudity in there!

01:20:01.255 --> 01:20:03.339
Well, her breasts
were rather large.

01:20:03.507 --> 01:20:05.425
It was a challenge
not to show them.

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:07.844
You'll have to cut those
six or seven frames...

01:20:08.012 --> 01:20:10.221
where she blinks
after she's supposed
to be dead.

01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:13.391
Alma, we've viewed the film
a thousand times.

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:15.226
She does not blink.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.564
How's it going in there?

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:21.065
Swimmingly.

01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:23.693
Well, everyone's saying
it's like a dog with fleas.

01:20:25.029 --> 01:20:26.863
HITCHCOCK:
No, absolutely not.

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:30.200
I do not want music
over the shower murder scene.

01:20:30.367 --> 01:20:32.535
But what Alma
and I talked about
is really going to play.

01:20:32.703 --> 01:20:35.955
Bernie, this is not Vertigo.
It's not a romantic movie!

01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:37.749
The images must
work on their own.

01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:39.959
Yes, but you can't
scare people just
by going "boo."

01:20:40.127 --> 01:20:42.045
All right,
you do it then.
You know best.

01:20:42.213 --> 01:20:45.381
Hitch, they have
to anticipate it.
Just take a step back!

01:20:45.549 --> 01:20:49.093
Well, thank God
we have Cinderfella
for the holidays.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:52.680

unbelievable music.

01:21:01.899 --> 01:21:04.108
I think I'll never
have a shower again.

01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:16.621
I distinctly saw
both the stabbing
and the nudity.

What you think
you're seeing

01:21:18.207 --> 01:21:21.209
is purely informed by
the power of suggestion.

I assure you,
once you view
the final version...

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:27.131
with Mister Herrmann's
lovely, lyrical score...

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:31.135
A lyrical score
is not going to
change my opinion.

this project...

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:44.208
you invite him to the set,
and he doesn't even show up.

"You're only as good
as your last picture."

01:30:07.861 --> 01:30:12.239
So, if you'll excuse me,
I had better toddle away...

01:30:12.407 --> 01:30:16.952
to begin the exhaustive search
for my next project.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:21.332
Unfortunately,
I find myself,
once again...

01:30:21.500 --> 01:30:24.668
quite bereft of
any inspiration.

01:30:24.836 --> 01:30:26.212
However...

01:30:26.379 --> 01:30:30.257
I do hope something
comes along soon.
