09:31.580 --> 09:33.710
this just isn't a normal day.

09:33.710 --> 09:37.080
Just as ours is not
a normal friendship,

09:37.080 --> 09:38.500
it's special.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.420

09:45.790 --> 09:48.000
It doesn't have
to be a big deal!

09:48.000 --> 09:49.420
We just gather up
some photos

09:49.420 --> 09:50.960
and a few mementos...

09:50.960 --> 09:52.620
We already have
our first one.

09:53.620 --> 09:54.830
The final baby tater.

10:05.460 --> 10:07.880
I don't want it.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.380
I don't want a ceremony.

10:09.380 --> 10:11.580
I don't want to dig
a hole in the ground

10:14.960 --> 10:17.170
All I wanted was a normal day.

10:18.330 --> 10:20.960
And now, it's starting
to feel like my funeral.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.040
Which I will not be going to.

10:34.210 --> 10:36.080
What was that?

10:38.830 --> 10:40.750
I think that was goodbye.

10:49.330 --> 10:51.040
I just don't
want that to be

10:51.040 --> 10:54.120
the last conversation we have
before she leaves.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.920
I'm sure she doesn't
want that either.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.120
I can't stop thinking
that tomorrow morning,

10:58.120 --> 11:01.120

Buffy will be gone.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.880
It must be even
harder for her.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.040
At least you get to stay.
She has to leave.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.000
Listen to you.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.670
What'd I say?

11:10.670 --> 11:13.380
You're so in touch
with your feelings.

11:13.380 --> 11:15.330
I guess now that
you're a songwriter.

11:15.330 --> 11:16.880
-(Andi chuckles)
-Hardly.

11:16.880 --> 11:19.710
Modest, too.
I wish Buffy was hearing this.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.210
Why?

11:21.210 --> 11:22.750
Doesn't Buffy like me?

11:22.750 --> 11:25.880
Of course she likes you.

11:25.880 --> 11:29.170
I just meant that this
is a fun conversation

11:29.170 --> 11:31.120
that she would enjoy...

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
if it wasn't so sad.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.040
I think you should do
that time capsule.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.580
No. She was very clear
about that.

11:38.580 --> 11:42.330
She was the first girl
to play basketball
at Jefferson Middle School.

11:42.330 --> 11:44.540
She made history.

11:44.540 --> 11:46.120
She's gonna want
that jersey someday.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.920
You're probably right,

11:48.920 --> 11:52.330
but she doesn't want
a time capsule.

11:52.330 --> 11:54.620
She said it'd be like going
to her own funeral.

11:54.620 --> 11:56.540
What if you don't bury it?

11:56.540 --> 11:58.210
That's kind of the point.

11:58.210 --> 12:00.170
I thought the point
was to show Buffy

12:00.170 --> 12:01.880
how much she means to you.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.920
So, we just go, "Here!
We made you a time capsule"?

12:06.920 --> 12:10.920
"And we didn't bury it,
so you can open it at any time."

12:10.920 --> 12:12.250
What's wrong with that?

12:14.290 --> 12:16.170
Absolutely nothing.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.120
(chuckles)

12:24.080 --> 12:25.710
Psst!

12:29.620 --> 12:30.960
Like your hat.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.120
Please keep it down.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.210
Buffy can't know
we're here.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.620
Covert operation.
Gotcha.

12:35.620 --> 12:37.250
I'm the eyes
for this mission.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.540
Andi will fill you in.

12:38.540 --> 12:40.290
I so regret giving you
those binoculars

12:40.290 --> 12:41.960
for your seventh birthday.

12:44.330 --> 12:46.380
Buffy doesn't wanna
say goodbye,

12:46.380 --> 12:48.790
but we need to.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.620
So, we're making her--

12:50.620 --> 12:52.170
It's not really
a time capsule.

12:52.170 --> 12:54.290
It's more of
a timeless capsule.

12:55.420 --> 12:58.210
Which she can open
whenever she wants.

12:58.210 --> 13:00.170
These are some things
we'd like to put in it.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.540
"Flat iron?"

13:02.540 --> 13:04.290
Buffy never uses a flat iron.

13:04.290 --> 13:06.540
She used it once.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.710
-"Prison jumpsuit?"
-(Cyrus and Andi giggle)

13:11.170 --> 13:13.670
Clearly I've missed
some major stuff
in my daughter's life.

13:15.290 --> 13:17.710
What do I do if I find
any of these things?

13:17.710 --> 13:20.040
Text us from a burner phone
using the code phrase,

13:20.040 --> 13:21.380
"I don't recommend
the eggplant."

13:21.380 --> 13:24.500
Or you can just
leave it in a box
by your front door.

13:24.500 --> 13:25.670
Copy that.

13:26.710 --> 13:29.120
-It's like you want
to get caught.
-(sighs)

13:33.790 --> 13:35.460
Celia:
He's not upstairs.

13:38.290 --> 13:40.250
-It's not hide-and-seek, Mom.
-(phone chimes)

13:40.250 --> 13:42.170
-Oh! Is that him?
-Oh!

13:42.170 --> 13:43.380
No. Words with Buddies.

13:43.380 --> 13:45.170
Well, turn off
your notifications.

13:45.170 --> 13:46.420
We're in crisis mode!

13:50.080 --> 13:51.790
Are you taking your turn?

13:51.790 --> 13:54.170
I have an X.

13:54.170 --> 13:55.380
(door closes)

13:57.000 --> 13:58.620
Hey, guys.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.670
I need a time capsule.

14:00.670 --> 14:03.120
Oh, sure.
You can have my spare one.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.830
Why don't you text Pops?
Pops is really good
with stuff like that.

14:05.830 --> 14:08.620
And Pops always
returns her texts.

14:08.620 --> 14:12.330
Yeah, uh, text him
and ask where you can
find a time capsule.

14:13.670 --> 14:15.420
She just said that.

14:15.420 --> 14:17.500
Yeah, and it's
a very good idea.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.040
Tell him you need it
right away.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.210
It's an emergency.

14:20.210 --> 14:21.880
I do need it right away.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.170
This is an emergency.

14:23.170 --> 14:24.250
-Yeah! Just like that.
-(phone chimes)

14:24.250 --> 14:25.830
-(Andi scoffs)
-Is that him?

14:27.210 --> 14:28.330
No.

14:28.330 --> 14:32.040
"Axis."
Good one, Mom.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.120
(chuckles)

14:41.420 --> 14:43.670
He's cute.
What's his name?

14:43.670 --> 14:46.210
(chuckles)
Marty from the Party.

14:46.210 --> 14:48.330
That's what I used
to call him.

14:48.330 --> 14:50.250
Was he your boyfriend?

14:50.250 --> 14:53.290
(sighs)
No, not really.

14:53.290 --> 14:54.290
We don't talk anymore,

14:54.290 --> 14:57.380
so he probably doesn't
even know that I'm leaving.

14:57.380 --> 15:00.620
Which is a shame,
because he'd love to know
that I'm leaving.

15:00.620 --> 15:03.540
What about Cyrus?
Ever go out with him?

15:03.540 --> 15:06.460
Pretty much every day.

15:06.460 --> 15:08.420
I'd like to hold on to these.

15:08.420 --> 15:11.120
I'd rather keep
all my pictures together.

15:14.920 --> 15:16.250
You're being weird.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.790
No, I'm not.

15:17.790 --> 15:19.670
Said the robot.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.170
-(laughing)
-What is going on?

15:23.460 --> 15:28.210
How is it that I can command
50 members of a platoon,

15:28.210 --> 15:30.420
but when it comes to keeping
secrets from my daughter,

15:30.420 --> 15:31.710
I am powerless?

15:31.710 --> 15:33.290
Secrets?

15:33.290 --> 15:36.080
(sighs) I can't.
I can't ruin it.

15:36.080 --> 15:37.790
I think you kinda
already have.

15:39.620 --> 15:44.460
Andi and Cyrus are collecting
mementos for a time capsule.

15:44.460 --> 15:45.330
(sighs)

15:45.330 --> 15:48.380
I specifically told them
I didn't want one.

15:48.380 --> 15:50.670
Hey! They actually put
a lot of thought into it.

15:50.670 --> 15:53.120
It sounds like a lovely
way to say goodbye.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.500
I can't say goodbye.

15:57.500 --> 15:59.000
Why not?

16:00.170 --> 16:02.750
Because...

16:02.750 --> 16:06.830
I can't remember my life
before I met Andi and Cyrus.

16:07.880 --> 16:09.710
We were seven,

16:09.710 --> 16:12.330
so there's not
a lot to remember.

16:13.580 --> 16:15.120
But now...

16:17.210 --> 16:20.420
I can't imagine
my life without them.

16:23.210 --> 16:24.880
They're a part of me.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.880
And we're an ecosystem.

16:30.750 --> 16:32.380
Is this making any sense?

16:32.380 --> 16:34.460
Yes.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.540
If I have to say
goodbye to them,

16:36.540 --> 16:38.880
I'll cry, I know I will.

16:38.880 --> 16:40.580
And what's wrong with that?

16:40.580 --> 16:42.880
I don't want their
last image of me

16:42.880 --> 16:44.750
to be me falling apart.

16:46.580 --> 16:48.920
I wish I was as strong as you.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.040
I thought I could be...

16:52.040 --> 16:53.380
but I'm not.

16:53.380 --> 16:56.380
I'm not as strong
as you think I am.

16:56.380 --> 16:58.040
You don't even cry.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.670
I certainly do.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.540
I've never seen you.

17:01.540 --> 17:04.330
Every time I'm deployed,

17:04.330 --> 17:08.670
I hold it together
just barely long enough
to say goodbye.

17:08.670 --> 17:10.920
But once I leave the room,

17:10.920 --> 17:14.330
the second I know
you can't see me...

17:16.500 --> 17:18.380
(whispers)
I cry.

17:18.380 --> 17:20.250
Oh, boy, do I cry.

17:23.420 --> 17:24.790
I didn't know that.

17:24.790 --> 17:26.500
Hey.

17:26.500 --> 17:29.460
I'll show you my tears
if you show me yours.

17:38.960 --> 17:41.420
♪ ♪

17:57.460 --> 18:00.000
I've been
grandparent-trapped.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.170
They used me as bait.

18:02.170 --> 18:04.120
Is this what you need?

18:04.120 --> 18:07.000
It's perfect.
Thanks, Pops.

18:10.670 --> 18:12.330
You two are shameless.

18:12.330 --> 18:15.290
Hey, you got
a time capsule
out of it.

18:15.290 --> 18:16.830
True.

18:20.580 --> 18:22.460
I'm not buying
The Fringe.

18:22.460 --> 18:23.830
I called off the deal.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.380
I saw her do it.

18:26.380 --> 18:27.880
Good.

18:27.880 --> 18:29.120
I'm sorry.

18:29.120 --> 18:31.580
You can't do this
again, Celia.

18:31.580 --> 18:33.670
-From now on,
you gotta talk to me first.
-I will.

18:33.670 --> 18:34.880
I promise.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.120
Oh!

18:37.120 --> 18:38.670
On that note...

18:38.670 --> 18:41.040
Um, here, have a seat.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.880
You can say no.

18:55.330 --> 18:57.580
Yeah, like I've ever
been able to.

19:04.460 --> 19:05.920
What do you got?

19:09.580 --> 19:11.750
You actually
made the T-shirts.

19:11.750 --> 19:12.830
I said I would.

19:13.830 --> 19:14.920
Also...

19:16.290 --> 19:18.170
I think this is
my best poster.

19:18.170 --> 19:19.620
What about the megaphones?

19:19.620 --> 19:20.420
Right here.

19:21.790 --> 19:23.080
What do you got?

19:23.080 --> 19:24.540
Oh.

19:24.540 --> 19:26.500
The school dress code
she helped change.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.540
Nice.

19:30.750 --> 19:34.210
A picture from Costume Day
in sixth grade.

19:34.210 --> 19:36.290
We were vampire dinosaurs.

19:36.290 --> 19:37.670
First of their kind.

19:42.540 --> 19:46.460
You made a belt out of our
social experiment wristbands.

19:48.290 --> 19:49.790
No time capsule
would be complete

19:49.790 --> 19:51.250
without an Andi Mack craft.

19:57.670 --> 19:59.790
-What's this?
-It's from Marty.

19:59.790 --> 20:02.620
-Really?
-Shoelaces.

20:02.620 --> 20:05.210
"Okay! So you were faster.

20:05.210 --> 20:09.500
"From your virtual boyfriend,
AKA Marty from the Party

20:09.500 --> 20:12.790
AKA 11.5."

20:12.790 --> 20:14.120
How's it going?

20:14.120 --> 20:15.420
Really well.

20:15.420 --> 20:16.710
Can I put something in?

20:16.710 --> 20:17.540
Of course.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.120
Buffy, season three.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.290
Why season three?

20:22.290 --> 20:23.790
They day I helped her
with her hair,

20:23.790 --> 20:25.750
she told me it was
her favorite season.

20:25.750 --> 20:28.540
Plus, it's the one
with Faith. Der.

20:33.250 --> 20:36.120
And now,
for the pièce de résistance.

20:40.040 --> 20:44.080

reverent music)

(humming continues)

20:52.750 --> 20:54.120
(humming ends)

20:57.620 --> 20:59.580
-I thought Jonah
was bringing something.
-(knocking on door)

20:59.580 --> 21:01.500
That's probably him now.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.420
Hope I'm not late.

21:06.420 --> 21:08.500
I just wanted to get everyone
on the team to sign this.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.170
Wow!

21:15.120 --> 21:16.420
Do you see this?

21:18.080 --> 21:19.620
You got TJ!

21:19.620 --> 21:22.120
Everyone's really
going to miss Buffy.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.580
Even her nemesis.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.790
He's her Faith!

21:26.790 --> 21:29.460
Mom! Don't spoil
season three!

21:29.460 --> 21:31.170
Sorry.

21:54.670 --> 21:56.080
This is an epic
time capsule.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.620
Buffy's gonna love it.

21:57.620 --> 21:59.620
Pat didn't leave us a box.

21:59.620 --> 22:01.580
Doesn't matter.
We still got a lot
of great stuff.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.000
Come on.

22:21.670 --> 22:23.380
Andi:
Pat's listening for us.

22:23.380 --> 22:24.710
(knocking on door)

22:24.710 --> 22:27.040
Does it matter if Buffy
answers the door?

22:27.040 --> 22:28.790
It's still a surprise.

22:28.790 --> 22:30.210
Good point.

22:31.830 --> 22:33.710
Buffy!

22:33.710 --> 22:36.670
-Buffy!
-Buffy!

22:36.670 --> 22:38.420
Do you think she's
still mad at us?

22:39.790 --> 22:42.120
-Buffy! Please!
-Open the door!

22:42.120 --> 22:44.120
-Buffy!
-Guys.

22:50.170 --> 22:51.380
Cyrus.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.210
She left already.

23:00.620 --> 23:03.170
No. She's not leaving
till the morning.

23:03.170 --> 23:05.120
Cyrus.

23:05.120 --> 23:07.210
She can't
just be gone.

23:08.670 --> 23:10.670
She never wanted
to say goodbye.

23:14.620 --> 23:15.710
So she didn't.

It's just, I have a boyfriend.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.830
Do me a favor and just
keep the shoes anyway.

23:46.830 --> 23:49.330
-I like your sneaks.
-They were a gift from a friend.

23:49.330 --> 23:50.830
It's okay.
I know who the friend is.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.040
Jonah, wait.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.790
At least Time Capsule Buffy
would never leave us

23:55.790 --> 23:56.880
without saying goodbye.

23:56.880 --> 23:58.540
I miss her so much.

23:58.540 --> 24:01.750
Andi:
I just wish she'd return
one of my 57 voice mails.

24:01.750 --> 24:03.790
Am I ever gonna hear
your voice again?
