WEBVTT

00:00.753 --> 00:01.978
He-Man.

00:02.020 --> 00:06.278
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.320 --> 00:08.178
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia

00:08.220 --> 00:11.578
and defender of the
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.620 --> 00:15.744
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.786 --> 00:19.778
Fabulous secret powers were
revealed to me the day I held

00:19.820 --> 00:24.444
aloft my magic sword and said,
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.220 --> 00:31.378
I have the power.

00:38.586 --> 00:41.778
Cringer became the
mighty Battle Cat, and I

00:41.820 --> 00:46.178
became He-Man, the most
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.086 --> 00:51.578
Only three others share this secret:

00:51.620 --> 00:55.911
Our friends the Sorceress,
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:57.120 --> 01:01.178
Together we defend Castle Grayskull
from the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:33.053 --> 01:35.244
Oh, no, oh no.

01:35.286 --> 01:36.678
Whoops.

01:36.720 --> 01:38.178
Oh no!

01:38.220 --> 01:39.596
Oh come on,
you bothersome balloons

01:39.620 --> 01:41.878
I've got to get everything
ready for the Queen's party.

01:43.620 --> 01:45.044
Oh, work, work, work.

01:45.086 --> 01:48.378
If I'm not charging
around as that brute,

01:48.420 --> 01:52.978
Battle Cat, I'm serving
refreshments at the palace.

01:53.020 --> 01:54.844
I need a vacation.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.111
What did you say?

02:04.153 --> 02:07.311
I said why don't
you watch where you're going?

02:07.353 --> 02:09.544
Me? It was your fault.

02:09.586 --> 02:10.811
Was not.

02:10.853 --> 02:11.878
Was so.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.044
Was not.

02:13.086 --> 02:14.044
Was so.

02:14.086 --> 02:15.578
Was not.

02:17.620 --> 02:20.278
Hey hold on here,
hey what are you guys doing?

02:20.320 --> 02:22.478
You're supposed to be
helping with the party.

02:23.686 --> 02:25.578
I'm sorry, Adam, but Orko...

02:25.620 --> 02:27.344
I did not.

02:27.386 --> 02:29.011
You two had better get this mess

02:29.053 --> 02:31.778
cleaned up or you'll
miss our special surprise.

02:31.820 --> 02:32.843
Surprise?

02:32.868 --> 02:35.911
Well why didn't you say so?

02:35.953 --> 02:37.244
Well, we got the room

02:37.286 --> 02:38.371
all decorated.

02:38.396 --> 02:41.011
So where's the big surprise?

02:41.053 --> 02:42.178
Right there.

02:44.553 --> 02:46.644
Yikes.
-Yipe!

02:46.686 --> 02:49.578
If you don't care for monsters,
perhaps you'd prefer a robot?

02:52.220 --> 02:54.744
What is your command?

02:54.786 --> 02:56.944
Hey, I know who that is.

02:56.986 --> 02:59.678
It's Man-E-Faces.

02:59.720 --> 03:00.978
At your service.

03:01.020 --> 03:04.111
Man-E agreed to be our
entertainment for the party tonight.

03:04.153 --> 03:06.511
Take a look at the new
faces I've been working on, Orko.

03:10.786 --> 03:12.311
It's Skeletor!

03:12.353 --> 03:13.544
And now!

03:14.886 --> 03:16.478
How about this?

03:17.420 --> 03:20.011
Beast Man!
That's really scary.

03:20.053 --> 03:21.611
Here's my grand finale.

03:23.853 --> 03:27.478
Yikes!

03:27.520 --> 03:30.978
Oh, oh, oh that's
the scariest one yet.

03:32.886 --> 03:34.106
Well what's this?

03:34.131 --> 03:36.435
A king-sized Orko?

03:37.853 --> 03:42.639
Man-E-Faces, I'd like you
to meet Duncan, our Man-at-Arms.

03:43.053 --> 03:45.111
My pleasure.

03:45.153 --> 03:47.811
I've heard my
daughter Teela talk about you.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.478
She says you're quite an actor.

03:49.520 --> 03:53.044
Uh, I am, thanks to her, and to He-Man.

03:53.086 --> 03:55.944
And now my friends I
must prepare for the show.

03:58.553 --> 04:00.244
I'll see ya there.

04:00.286 --> 04:03.611
What did he mean,
thanks to Teela and He-Man?

04:03.653 --> 04:04.744
That's right.

04:04.786 --> 04:05.962
You were away when it happened.

04:05.986 --> 04:07.811
But I'll never forget it.

04:07.853 --> 04:10.078
... and neither will I.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.778
Well would
somebody please fill me in?

04:12.820 --> 04:14.711
Well, it's
a long story, but once

04:14.753 --> 04:18.111
Man-E-Faces wasn't the
kindly soul he is today.

04:18.153 --> 04:21.043
And if you don't believe me, you can
ask our little friends the Widgets.

04:21.086 --> 04:24.578
For, our story really begins with them,

04:24.620 --> 04:26.844
and the monster that for several nights

04:26.886 --> 04:29.544
had been haunting their fortress.

04:35.286 --> 04:38.111
Do... do you think the monster
might be back tonight?

04:38.153 --> 04:39.411
I sure hope not.

04:49.253 --> 04:50.878
Did you hear that?

04:50.920 --> 04:53.678
It sounds close.

04:53.720 --> 04:55.744
Squinch, can you see anything?

04:55.786 --> 04:57.311
Squinch, where are you?

04:57.353 --> 04:58.611
I'm right here.

05:00.986 --> 05:03.744
It's uh... uh...
it's scary up there.

05:03.786 --> 05:06.244
Squinch, I'm warning you.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.944
Yes the monster was
none other than Man-E-Faces.

05:11.986 --> 05:15.611
But he wasn't the
friendly actor we know now.

05:15.653 --> 05:17.911
In those days well, he was

05:17.953 --> 05:21.611
solemn and harsh, a bitter outcast.

05:23.253 --> 05:25.644
Go away you creepy creature!

05:25.686 --> 05:27.344
Let me in!

05:27.386 --> 05:28.744
Let me in!

05:28.786 --> 05:29.944
You little worms!

05:29.986 --> 05:31.678
I'll force you to open your door.

05:39.986 --> 05:41.678
Stay back.

05:50.920 --> 05:54.978
Cork, Squinch, fire
the signal flare and call He-Man.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.611
Oh no you don't.

06:01.653 --> 06:02.911
You're not calling anyone.

06:07.353 --> 06:11.711
I'm in charge here and you can forget
about anyone coming to help you.

06:21.586 --> 06:26.578
Hm, take a look, Beast Man, I
think you'll find this interesting.

06:26.620 --> 06:30.078
Ah, who is he Skeletor?

06:30.120 --> 06:33.544
I don't know, but
with most of our evil allies

06:33.586 --> 06:38.157
in jail or on missions elsewhere
I could use his sinister power.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.778
Get the Collector ready.

06:40.820 --> 06:44.778
We'll leave for Widget Woods and
meet this mysterious stranger.

06:46.253 --> 06:49.178
But Skeletor wasn't the
only one watching the stranger.

06:51.820 --> 06:55.411
Zoar the Falcon had seen the
Widget's troubles and flew to tell me.

07:02.353 --> 07:03.411
Adam?

07:03.453 --> 07:04.611
Yeah?

07:04.653 --> 07:07.811
Um, how about tur...
turning off the alarm clock?

07:07.853 --> 07:10.411
Mm, we don't
have an alarm clock.

07:10.453 --> 07:14.453
Well then, turn off the falcon.

07:15.453 --> 07:16.911
Oh okay.

07:16.953 --> 07:18.244
Falcon?!

07:18.286 --> 07:20.678
I'm sorry to disturb
your sleep, my friends,

07:20.720 --> 07:24.244
but the Widget people are
in dire need of He-Man.

07:24.286 --> 07:27.611
Oh, Adam, I
need my beauty sleep.

07:29.386 --> 07:32.944
Sorry Cringer, the
Widgets need He-Man and Battle Cat.

07:38.253 --> 07:40.444
By the power of Grayskull.

07:45.620 --> 07:49.620
I have the power.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.953
He-Man!

08:19.886 --> 08:21.744
Where are you heading to, this early?

08:21.786 --> 08:23.078
The Widget
people are in trouble.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.411
How about giving us a hand?

08:24.453 --> 08:26.211
You got it.

08:38.520 --> 08:40.443
Hurry up with
that food, I'm hungry.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.644
Yuck.

08:49.686 --> 08:50.844
I don't want this slop.

08:50.886 --> 08:52.278
Bring me something else.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.244
I'd like to bring
him a fast boot out the door.

08:55.286 --> 08:58.844
No. Now Laurel,
we mustn't make our guest angry.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.144
He's not our guest.

09:00.186 --> 09:02.911
He's a bully. And we
should stand up to him.

09:02.953 --> 09:05.078
What's going on
here? Where's my dinner?

09:05.120 --> 09:08.211
I've had enough of you,
you funny faced weirdo!

09:08.253 --> 09:09.778
Hey, put that down!

09:09.820 --> 09:11.344
Widgets!

09:11.386 --> 09:12.311
Huh?

09:12.353 --> 09:14.511
Open your fortress, it's He-Man!

09:14.553 --> 09:16.644
Cool! It's He-Man!

09:16.686 --> 09:18.278
Ha, you're in for it now!

09:18.320 --> 09:20.244
Widgets, can you hear me?

09:21.453 --> 09:22.611
Widgets!

09:22.653 --> 09:24.211
Tell him to go away.

09:24.253 --> 09:27.778
Uh, uh, well uh, he he.

09:27.820 --> 09:29.911
Go on, do it or I'll-

09:29.953 --> 09:33.211
He-Man help!

09:33.253 --> 09:35.411
We're trapped inside.

09:35.453 --> 09:37.611
Hurry, Battle Cat,
they're in danger!

09:37.653 --> 09:40.311
Ah, to the rescue!

09:47.953 --> 09:49.378
Who are you?

09:49.420 --> 09:52.311
I'm called He-Man,
and the Widgets are my friends.

09:52.353 --> 09:56.078
Ah, picking on little guys huh?

09:56.120 --> 09:58.744
How'd you like to take me on?

09:59.953 --> 10:02.078
Stay back I'm warning you.

10:02.120 --> 10:06.078
Careful cat, this
guy isn't all he seems.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.644
Go away.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.578
Don't laugh at me.

10:17.620 --> 10:20.678
Everyone always laughs at me.

10:29.453 --> 10:32.144
Give yourself up
we don't want to hurt you.

10:32.186 --> 10:34.478
Three against one not fair.

10:34.520 --> 10:38.311
Oh, now look who's talking
about what's not fair.

10:38.353 --> 10:42.353
I'll handle this, Teela.

10:47.120 --> 10:51.120
No, you won't catch me!

10:55.786 --> 10:59.244
You're pretty tricky fella, but
we'll stop you if we have to.

11:01.053 --> 11:02.344
Why, he's gone!

11:05.653 --> 11:07.811
What... what am I doing here?

11:07.853 --> 11:09.811
Welcome, stranger.

11:09.853 --> 11:12.678
I am Skeletor and this is Beast Man.

11:12.720 --> 11:16.911
You might as well make yourself at
home, because you won't be leaving.

11:31.626 --> 11:34.451
He-Man.. that big ship..

11:34.493 --> 11:37.051
I know Teela,
that's Skeletor's Collector.

11:37.093 --> 11:41.784
Oh it figures, that creep
was one of the Skeletor's gang.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.718
Was he, Squinch, I wonder?

11:43.760 --> 11:46.318
Come on, He-Man,
you saw what he did to

11:46.360 --> 11:50.051
the Widgets, picking on those
poor little squirts like that.

11:50.093 --> 11:53.551
Hey, watch who you're
callin' a squirt, half-pint.

11:53.593 --> 11:55.651
He-Man is right, my friends.

11:57.360 --> 11:59.469
Though the stranger was hostile,

11:59.494 --> 12:02.484
I sense there is no real evil in him.

12:02.526 --> 12:05.918
He is a man terribly alone and afraid.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.784
Well, he made us feel terribly afraid.

12:08.826 --> 12:12.884
Sometimes, Squinch,
the ones who seem the worst

12:12.926 --> 12:15.418
are the ones who need our help the most.

12:15.460 --> 12:19.460
Ah, I'm getting a psychic
signal from Grayskull.

12:20.360 --> 12:22.002
Skeletor is on his way
there to attack it.

12:24.760 --> 12:25.760
Let's go.

12:27.526 --> 12:28.618
We'll come too, He-Man.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.018
Thanks, Kando, but if Skeletor is

12:31.060 --> 12:33.318
behind this, we'd better face him first.

12:37.526 --> 12:41.184
Bye, He-Man! Bye!

12:44.460 --> 12:47.451
I've been watching you stranger.

12:47.493 --> 12:49.086
Your ability to change your

12:49.111 --> 12:51.151
faces, and your strength would be

12:51.193 --> 12:52.872
of great use to me and my

12:52.897 --> 12:54.618
conquest of this planet.

12:54.660 --> 12:56.351
I don't work with anyone.

12:56.393 --> 12:59.618
Yeah, but think
of the power we could share.

12:59.660 --> 13:01.984
No one would ever laugh at you again.

13:02.026 --> 13:05.218
Least of all He-Man and
those miserable Widgets.

13:05.260 --> 13:07.484
I said no,
now let me out of here.

13:07.526 --> 13:10.251
No one says no to Skeletor, fool!

13:10.293 --> 13:13.018
I'll force you to serve me.

13:13.060 --> 13:16.018
No!

13:18.326 --> 13:20.184
Fool!

13:20.226 --> 13:21.853
Beast Man, use your mental

13:21.878 --> 13:23.942
powers to control that monster!

13:29.026 --> 13:31.484
Ah! I-I-I-I-

13:31.526 --> 13:33.951
I can't resist his power!

13:33.993 --> 13:37.218
Your will is mine now.

13:37.260 --> 13:39.551
Have to give in.

13:39.593 --> 13:42.518
Have to obey.

13:42.560 --> 13:46.560
Yes master what is your command?

13:50.060 --> 13:53.251
After we use this dolt to
help us break into Grayskull.

13:53.293 --> 13:57.118
You can have him for a slave, Beast Man.

13:57.160 --> 14:00.484
A slave of my own.

14:00.526 --> 14:02.641
Now I'll have someone,

14:02.666 --> 14:04.950
to boss around for a change.

14:13.493 --> 14:14.984
There's the castle.

14:15.026 --> 14:16.284
Fire!

14:18.260 --> 14:19.951
Only here at Grayskull are

14:19.993 --> 14:21.851
my powers strong enough
to combat Skeletor.

14:21.893 --> 14:24.851
I hope they are equal to the
test, this time.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.379
She's fighting back,

14:28.404 --> 14:30.818
but our mystic shields are holding.

14:30.860 --> 14:32.585
Take our slave and get going,

14:32.610 --> 14:34.884
you know what to do.

14:39.326 --> 14:43.418
Oh, I can't keep
them away much longer.

14:50.293 --> 14:54.151
Follow me, and do as I say.

14:54.193 --> 14:56.718
Yes, Master.

14:59.426 --> 15:03.018
Ah, the sorceress
is so busy fighting

15:03.060 --> 15:06.851
Skeletor, her barrier around
the castle is weakening.

15:06.893 --> 15:10.893
Here slave, start pulling!

15:12.526 --> 15:16.526
Use your monster strength
to open Grayskull!

15:18.393 --> 15:20.451
Beast Man and the
stranger are breaking in!

15:20.493 --> 15:23.651
But I can't drop my
defenses to stop them!

15:23.693 --> 15:27.907
Another few
seconds and Grayskull is mine!

15:30.393 --> 15:32.284
Pull, slave. Pull!

15:35.326 --> 15:38.684
Ah, it's working.

15:38.726 --> 15:41.110
Ah, hurry, hurry cur,

15:41.135 --> 15:42.818
she was almost open.

15:42.860 --> 15:46.860
Let go of that rope fuzz-face.

15:48.026 --> 15:49.684
He-Man?!

15:54.660 --> 15:57.418
Slave, come help me!

15:57.460 --> 15:59.918
I obey, Master.

16:05.426 --> 16:08.384
I don't want to fight you.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.918
I am not evil.

16:11.893 --> 16:14.051
Please help me.

16:14.093 --> 16:17.118
Get him. Get him!

16:17.160 --> 16:19.651
No, I have to do it.

16:19.693 --> 16:21.418
Beast Man commands.

16:27.726 --> 16:28.726
Hold it.

16:28.826 --> 16:30.768
The Sorceress says you're not evil, but uh,

16:30.793 --> 16:32.218
we're not taking any chances.

16:32.660 --> 16:33.660
Sorceress.

16:33.860 --> 16:36.451
Use your magic to help the stranger.

16:36.493 --> 16:38.384
I. think he's on our side.

16:38.426 --> 16:39.818
The stranger?

16:40.760 --> 16:41.918
Yes.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.284
He's the answer.

16:43.326 --> 16:44.751
Stranger!

16:44.793 --> 16:46.408
Be a monster no more,

16:46.433 --> 16:48.817
turn back to your human self.

16:50.693 --> 16:51.812
I'm myself again,

16:51.837 --> 16:54.075
the Beast Man's spell is broken.

17:00.826 --> 17:03.484
Aah, aah!

17:03.526 --> 17:05.251
Put me down!

17:05.292 --> 17:07.406
Curse He-Man and that stranger,

17:07.431 --> 17:09.518
they've destroyed everything.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.356
Skeletor, help me.

17:11.381 --> 17:13.474
Get me out of here!

17:14.560 --> 17:16.306
What do you say we pay a visit

17:16.330 --> 17:18.018
on old bone head, friend?

17:19.260 --> 17:20.351
I'm with you.

17:25.292 --> 17:27.251
Where did they go?

17:27.292 --> 17:31.722
I think I know and I don't think
Skeletor is going to like it.

17:38.493 --> 17:39.751
He-Man!

17:39.793 --> 17:41.618
Your Collector isn't
welcome here Skeletor.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.818
So we're shutting it down.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.151
No.

18:16.326 --> 18:19.151
I'll get you for this, He-Maaaan!

18:27.726 --> 18:32.518
I fear even the bottomless gorge
will not stop Skeletor for long.

18:32.560 --> 18:35.184
But I thank you for
your assistance, He-Man.

18:35.226 --> 18:36.451
You too, stranger.

18:36.493 --> 18:39.751
Yeah, sure.
Well, I guess I'll be going now.

18:39.793 --> 18:42.984
Wait, you
might have been mean to

18:43.026 --> 18:45.751
the Widgets, but we know
you're not a villain.

18:45.793 --> 18:46.751
Who are you?

18:46.793 --> 18:49.118
No one ever asked me that before.

18:49.160 --> 18:52.351
People were always afraid of
me, and the things I could do.

18:52.393 --> 18:55.284
Because I could change my appearance
they thought I was a monster

18:55.326 --> 18:59.118
and since nobody wanted me around,
I, I became cold and cruel.

18:59.160 --> 19:02.384
I learned to take what I wanted
from those weaker than me.

19:02.426 --> 19:03.851
Like the Widgets.

19:03.893 --> 19:07.684
Yes, but after my
encounter with Skeletor and Beast Man,

19:07.726 --> 19:11.551
I know what it's like
to pushed around and bullied.

19:11.593 --> 19:14.551
Thanks for helping me
understand myself, He-Man.

19:14.593 --> 19:17.584
It's like the Sorceress
said, sometimes the ones

19:17.626 --> 19:20.951
who seem the worst
need our help the most.

19:20.993 --> 19:22.051
You're learning.

19:22.093 --> 19:23.518
Well, if we've got a new

19:23.560 --> 19:26.351
friend, I'd like to know his name.

19:26.393 --> 19:28.384
Name? I never had one.

19:28.426 --> 19:29.784
Not a real one anyway.

19:29.826 --> 19:31.284
Then, we will give you one.

19:31.326 --> 19:34.151
One that is fitting
for your many talents.

19:34.193 --> 19:35.484
And many faces.

19:35.526 --> 19:37.118
Hey, that's it!

19:37.160 --> 19:40.018
Man-E-Faces.

19:43.093 --> 19:45.784
Well after that,
Man-E learned to put his face

19:45.826 --> 19:47.418
changing ability to good use

19:47.460 --> 19:49.751
and became Eternia's most famous actor.

19:49.793 --> 19:51.751
Which reminds me,
we've been so wrapped

19:51.793 --> 19:54.651
up in your story,
we've probably missed his performance.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.784
Hey, that's right!

20:11.526 --> 20:13.451
Thank you, my friends.

20:13.493 --> 20:15.051
Thank you.

20:29.593 --> 20:32.184
And Man-E, could
help me with a problem?

20:32.226 --> 20:33.451
Sure, Orko.

20:33.493 --> 20:34.984
I can never remember anything.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.584
How do actors learn their speeches?

20:37.626 --> 20:38.416
By rehearsing,

20:38.441 --> 20:40.084
we practice saying them again and again.

20:40.426 --> 20:42.502
Well, that's what you have
to do if you're trying to

20:42.526 --> 20:43.564
remember something from school,

20:43.589 --> 20:45.160
say it to yourself
over and over again.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.902
Rehearse it in your
mind just like an actor.

20:47.026 --> 20:50.284
Say goodbye,
say goodbye, say goodbye.

20:50.326 --> 20:52.122
What are you doing?
-Oh, I'm trying to

20:52.147 --> 20:54.151
remember to say goodbye. Bye!

20:54.193 --> 20:55.193
It worked.
