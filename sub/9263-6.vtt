WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:01.698
What do you want to talk about, Tim?

00:01.700 --> 00:04.846
The fact that you're sleeping with
your paralyzed best friend's girlfriend?

00:05.661 --> 00:07.046
Tatom, get over here

00:07.047 --> 00:08.977
We gonna win, we gonna play my way.

00:09.441 --> 00:11.298
<i>Oh, and it's picked off!</i>

00:11.741 --> 00:13.079
Get outta my sight, son!

00:13.080 --> 00:14.386
You are done!

00:14.387 --> 00:15.840
- I don't care!
- You are done here!

00:15.841 --> 00:18.141
Some questions have arisen about
about Ray Tatom's eligibility.

00:18.146 --> 00:20.140
If he is deemed ineligible,

00:20.143 --> 00:22.245
Ray Tatom won't be playing
football here anymore.

00:22.248 --> 00:24.509
And Dillon will be stripped
of last night's victory.

00:27.549 --> 00:31.541
<i>I'm here tonight at the Texas High School
Athletic Administration District meeting.</i>

00:31.549 --> 00:34.440
<i>If it is found that district
regulations were violated,</i>

00:34.446 --> 00:38.641
<i>Ray Tatom no longer be allowed to
participate in any varsity athletics.</i>

00:38.646 --> 00:40.843
<i>More importantly,
last week's Dillon Panther win</i>

00:40.848 --> 00:44.140
<i>over the Arnett Mead Tigers
would be ruled a loss.</i>

00:44.147 --> 00:47.073
<i>- Can we change the channel?
...to see how this turns out for the Panthers...</i>

00:49.445 --> 00:51.541
I don't get what the big deal is.

00:51.548 --> 00:55.142
Kaster, she's just asking you
to turn your volume down.

00:55.146 --> 00:57.650
It's not just me playing loud.
We're all doing it.

00:57.665 --> 01:00.643
No, see, actually, she did
single out the bass player.

01:00.846 --> 01:02.421
Hey, Saracen!

01:02.427 --> 01:03.843
Get over here, man.

01:04.644 --> 01:05.842
I'll be right back.

01:05.847 --> 01:07.510
I'll count the seconds.

01:09.145 --> 01:10.940
Hey, I want you
to meet some people here.

01:10.947 --> 01:12.541
This is Tiff.

01:12.545 --> 01:15.200
Look, I'm telling, Tiff.
This man right here is golden.

01:15.206 --> 01:17.341
You better get him now before
somebody beats you to it.

01:18.217 --> 01:19.423
Hey, that's not--
That's a Joke.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.332
He's totally crossed over, man.

01:23.607 --> 01:25.082
Would you calm down?
No, man.

01:25.506 --> 01:26.403
Look at him.

01:26.408 --> 01:28.350
Like the entire world
revolves around them.

01:28.357 --> 01:31.400
Don't they know they're gonna
end up menial laborers one day anyway?

01:31.667 --> 01:33.531
Virgin territory.
Smash, no. See, now that's--

01:33.568 --> 01:35.213
I'm trying to help you out, man.

01:37.000 --> 01:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.705 --> 01:47.302
What you doing here, Voodoo?

01:47.305 --> 01:49.503
Just getting a burger and fries, man.
You got a problem with that?

01:49.508 --> 01:51.002
Yeah, I got a problem with that.

01:51.008 --> 01:52.401
We all got a problem with that.

01:52.408 --> 01:54.103
Why don't you find another
restaurant, man?

01:54.106 --> 01:56.501
Why don't you go on back
cross that river?

01:56.508 --> 01:58.000
What'd you say to me?

01:58.005 --> 01:59.703
I said you should take
your wetback ass

01:59.705 --> 02:01.603
right on across the river.

02:03.305 --> 02:07.290
- It's not worth it.
- Just chill, just chill. Don't even listen.

02:07.905 --> 02:11.401
- Don't even listen to him. All right, just chill.
- Everybody needs to just chill out.

02:11.405 --> 02:13.730
Last thing you need right now
is to mix up with us, man.

02:13.738 --> 02:15.073
Trust me.

02:17.408 --> 02:19.461
Food sucks here anyway.

02:22.908 --> 02:24.651
Move.

02:24.908 --> 02:27.003
Take your bodyguards with you.

02:27.805 --> 02:30.190
My man Rig.
Making the peace.

02:31.796 --> 02:32.710
Hey, the news!

02:33.007 --> 02:35.270
<i>We're live with Channel 8 Action Update.
We are here at the Texas High School
Athletic Administration District meeting</i>

02:36.008 --> 02:38.272
<i>where board member Lance
Jennings is about to announce</i>

02:38.275 --> 02:41.550
<i>the board's decision
about Dillon quarterback</i>

02:41.557 --> 02:43.103
<i>Ray Voodoo Tatom's eligibility.</i>

02:43.108 --> 02:46.501
<i>I would like to thank everyone
for their patience in this matter,</i>

02:46.506 --> 02:49.520
<i>but I feel we need more time
for deliberations. Therefore,</i>

02:49.528 --> 02:52.503
<i>we will not be issuing a final ruling
until some time later in the week.</i>

03:02.405 --> 03:05.502
Hey, we're heading out.
You need a ride?

03:05.908 --> 03:08.400
Uh, yeah.
Just gimme one minute, okay?

03:08.407 --> 03:10.602
Get over yourself, man.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.702
It's just a stupid football game.

03:12.705 --> 03:15.900
In the large scheme of things,
do you think anyone's gonna give a crap?

03:15.905 --> 03:17.101
Kaster, please, just go wait--

03:17.105 --> 03:19.202
Am I right about that?

03:19.208 --> 03:21.691
- Just go wait outside, all right?
- That's fine.

03:22.656 --> 03:24.650
- Is this your buddy?
- Is he being serious right now?

03:24.676 --> 03:26.530
He's joking.
He's making jokes.

03:26.976 --> 03:28.810
I mean, I like Kaster okay
and everything.

03:28.815 --> 03:31.212
But seriously, he's gotta learn
that he can't just talk to people like that.

03:31.216 --> 03:33.960
I know.
I said that I'll talk to him.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.240
What a dumb-ass thing to say, man.

03:38.317 --> 03:39.613
Look, I'm sorry, man.

03:39.617 --> 03:41.811
Sorry?

03:41.818 --> 03:45.310
Look, man,
I'm sorry, all right?

03:45.317 --> 03:47.911
You don't look sorry.

03:47.915 --> 03:48.911
What's your problem, man?

03:48.917 --> 03:50.113
Dumb football players, huh?

03:50.116 --> 03:51.180
Man, chill. Come on.

03:51.188 --> 03:52.580
You know that's not what I meant.

03:53.117 --> 03:55.530
Is that what you heard?

03:57.977 --> 03:59.371
Do you mean that?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.333
Get off, man! Hey, Kaster!
Get off him! Kaster! Reyes!

04:11.297 --> 04:12.531
Man, what the hell you doin'?

04:12.598 --> 04:13.981
What the hell, man?
Let's turn him.

04:15.198 --> 04:18.482
- Easy!
- No, just stay there. Just stay right there!

04:18.517 --> 04:20.992
- Oh, my God.
- Breathe, man.

04:29.598 --> 04:33.491
Friday Night Lights
s01e06 - El Accident

05:09.125 --> 05:11.703
Blue, 52.
Hut!

05:15.405 --> 05:17.530
Bring it back.
Hustle up, come on!

05:18.265 --> 05:20.833
Coach, the board didn't come
to a decision.

05:20.836 --> 05:23.212
So why am I not getting snaps?

05:24.216 --> 05:28.152
All right, now, hey, coach!
Let's get 'em together. One minute, take a break.

05:29.787 --> 05:32.191
One minute, bring it back
to the 30, let's go.

05:32.198 --> 05:35.692
Hey, Reyes. Reyes.
What happened?

05:35.697 --> 05:36.893
What are you talking about?

05:36.896 --> 05:39.291
Last night with Kaster.
I know that kid.

05:39.296 --> 05:42.393
He dissed us.
You heard him.

05:42.398 --> 05:44.193
What are you talking about,
that stupid thing that he said?

05:44.197 --> 05:46.141
It's done, man.
Get over it.

05:46.696 --> 05:48.693
Let's go, gentlemen!
Let's go! Let's go!

05:48.698 --> 05:49.812
Coach.

05:51.497 --> 05:54.331
Sorry to interrupt your practice, Coach.
We need Bobby Reyes.

05:54.338 --> 05:55.520
I've got a warrant on him.

05:56.396 --> 05:58.193
What do you need Bobby for?

05:58.196 --> 05:59.853
A ssault.

06:01.198 --> 06:02.503
Get him.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.252
Reyes!

06:05.595 --> 06:06.871
Yeah, Coach?

06:07.898 --> 06:10.193
Ron, you don't need
to use handcuffs.

06:10.196 --> 06:12.532
Hell, come on.
Where's he gonna go?

06:15.296 --> 06:17.193
Sorry about your practice.

06:17.195 --> 06:18.763
Let's go. Come on.

06:20.496 --> 06:23.163
Concentrate on the field.
Let that go, come on!

06:23.168 --> 06:25.811
This is your job right here!

06:25.816 --> 06:28.611
- Get under it, Saracen. Let's run this.
- It'll be all right, Reyes!

06:28.678 --> 06:30.100
Tyra...

06:31.246 --> 06:32.993
you're flunking algebra.

06:32.996 --> 06:34.192
Ms. Kincaid hates me.

06:34.195 --> 06:35.591
- She does not. Come on. 
- Yes, she does.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.281
Well, if you fail it
with Mrs. Kincaid,

06:37.286 --> 06:39.192
you're gonna have to go do it
next semester with Mr. Wendell.

06:39.195 --> 06:40.491
Well, I'm not gonna be here
next semester.

06:40.497 --> 06:41.791
Where're you gonna go?

06:41.798 --> 06:43.693
California.

06:43.698 --> 06:46.292
What are you gonna do in California
without a high school education?

06:46.297 --> 06:47.591
I'm taking my GED.

06:47.596 --> 06:50.693
Listen, I know.
I was just like you.

06:50.696 --> 06:54.292
I was the pretty girl in school.
I was terrible at math.

06:54.296 --> 06:56.493
I got myself through it.

06:56.496 --> 07:01.092
I don't wanna be you, Mrs. Taylor.

07:01.097 --> 07:04.891
I don't wanna stay here.
Stuck in this small town...

07:04.907 --> 07:07.090
in a job like this...

07:07.095 --> 07:08.891
married to a coach.

07:08.897 --> 07:12.393
Tyra, it's your choice.
If you wanna go off and take the GED, fine.

07:12.396 --> 07:14.791
But you better bring me proof
that you did it.

07:14.795 --> 07:18.491
Otherwise, you're taking algebra
with Mr. Wendell next semester.

07:18.498 --> 07:20.150
Fine.

07:26.893 --> 07:28.095
Mrs. Taylor?

07:28.098 --> 07:29.099
Yes, ma'am.

07:29.099 --> 07:30.491
I'm Kurt Kaster's mother.

07:30.499 --> 07:32.291
Oh, come on in. Come on in.

07:32.298 --> 07:33.990
I'm so sorry to hear about
what happened with your son.

07:33.997 --> 07:35.023
Have a seat.

07:35.027 --> 07:36.923
I was told to see you about
getting his homework

07:36.925 --> 07:38.841
sent over to him at the hospital.

07:38.847 --> 07:41.643
Yes, we've already arranged
that his daily assignments

07:41.645 --> 07:43.521
are gonna be taken over there
every afternoon.

07:43.617 --> 07:47.351
And then everything else that we need to do
academically will be taken care of.

07:47.356 --> 07:48.571
I appreciate that.

07:48.815 --> 07:49.552
Absolutely.

07:49.638 --> 07:52.112
And just--if there's anything
else that I can do...

07:52.147 --> 07:54.311
I raised my boy right,
Mrs. Taylor.

07:54.347 --> 07:55.271
He's a good boy.

07:55.317 --> 07:57.973
- Yes, he is.
- He doesn't get into fights.

07:58.016 --> 08:01.493
A few days from now, that Reyes boy
is gonna be back on the football team

08:01.527 --> 08:03.561
like nothing ever happened.

08:03.605 --> 08:05.912
But I don't need
to tell you this, do I ?

08:05.945 --> 08:08.901
You're the coach's wife.
You know how all this works.

08:08.907 --> 08:10.143
Well, no, I don't actually.

08:10.148 --> 08:12.250
Thank you for helping
about the homework.

08:17.716 --> 08:19.300
You tellin' me the truth
straight up?

08:19.416 --> 08:21.642
That's it.
They just talked.

08:21.777 --> 08:23.931
Y'all are telling me
everything you saw?

08:24.606 --> 08:25.232
That's it.

08:25.308 --> 08:28.921
You have any idea how difficult it is
with these recruitment accusations

08:28.997 --> 08:30.001
flying around right now?

08:30.076 --> 08:33.261
Now I gotta deal with Reyes
and this Kaster kid situation.

08:33.475 --> 08:35.510
It's just as much your fault
as it is his.

08:35.636 --> 08:36.971
From now on, when you're out,

08:37.138 --> 08:39.801
you hear something, you see something
you're gonna stop it.

08:39.866 --> 08:43.100
As leaders of this team, that is gonna be
your job. Are we clear?

08:43.308 --> 08:44.491
Yes, sir.

08:44.636 --> 08:47.000
Good.
That's all I got to say.

08:47.797 --> 08:50.091
You ever get an answer back
on that request we put in

08:50.136 --> 08:51.790
for extra time
in the weight room?

08:51.837 --> 08:53.043
Not yet.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.332
Jason's making world-class progress.

08:56.465 --> 08:58.192
I'll make sure and get you
an answer on that.

08:58.235 --> 08:59.461
Thanks.

09:01.736 --> 09:03.460
What's so funny?

09:03.598 --> 09:05.590
You know what they call you
around here?

09:05.938 --> 09:08.001
- What?
- "Advocado."

09:08.138 --> 09:09.730
I don't get it.

09:09.768 --> 09:13.402
- It's like advocate and avocado.
- I don't find that very amusing.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.890
It is funny.
Come on, think about it.

09:17.935 --> 09:19.930
They pumping you
with nitrous or something?

09:19.996 --> 09:21.390
What is going on with you?

09:21.437 --> 09:23.801
- I don't know.
- What are you doing?

09:23.937 --> 09:25.093
Come here.

09:25.436 --> 09:27.490
- Jason, we can't do this.
- Yeah, we can.

09:27.537 --> 09:30.403
- We're in a public place.
- I knew it.

09:30.537 --> 09:31.761
- I knew it!
- What?

09:31.798 --> 09:34.263
We have a visitor.

09:34.697 --> 09:35.990
Oh, my...

09:38.265 --> 09:40.860
Lyla, I gotta tell you.
I am horny as hell right now.

09:40.958 --> 09:42.031
- Jason!
- What?

09:42.097 --> 09:45.792
I have never heard you talk
like this in my life.

09:46.406 --> 09:49.293
- That's just naughty.
- Naughty.

09:52.936 --> 09:55.360
You are one of a kind,
you know that?

10:01.667 --> 10:03.491
Hey, Lyla.

10:03.938 --> 10:05.332
Hi, Francine.

10:05.565 --> 10:08.203
Is it possible that we could have
about 40 minutes of privacy?

10:08.337 --> 10:10.302
No, Jason.
We don't need it.

10:10.437 --> 10:11.833
Can I talk to him for
a second, Lyla?

10:11.865 --> 10:14.193
Yeah, sure.
I'll just be outside.

10:17.898 --> 10:20.661
You wanna make sure you don't get any dirt
up in this carburetor.

10:20.737 --> 10:22.861
Mess your engine up something fierce.

10:23.796 --> 10:25.162
Looks like we got company.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.692
What's up?

10:36.766 --> 10:39.413
Tim, we have to stop this.

10:45.506 --> 10:47.433
Look at me, Tim.

10:47.608 --> 10:49.153
Please.

10:51.867 --> 10:54.602
Jason is getting out of there soon.
He's changing.

10:55.107 --> 10:57.662
He's getting back to his old self.

10:58.877 --> 11:01.610
So you're done with me?

11:02.246 --> 11:03.943
- Tim, don't.
- Don't what?

11:03.978 --> 11:07.503
Don't react like that.
You knew this had to end.

11:08.275 --> 11:11.601
Look, I take full responsibility for
everything that's happened.

11:11.706 --> 11:13.130
It's all my fault.

11:13.337 --> 11:16.370
Sounds like it was the biggest
mistake of your life, Lyla.

11:16.506 --> 11:19.103
I feel like I have to make
a choice here, Tim,

11:19.236 --> 11:23.400
before things get more messed up
than they already are.

11:23.806 --> 11:26.873
I care about you, Tim.
I do.

11:27.108 --> 11:28.270
I just...

11:28.406 --> 11:32.000
I can't live
with myself anymore.

11:35.577 --> 11:37.601
Bye, Lyla.

11:42.408 --> 11:44.460
So you're telling me
I can't have sex?

11:44.628 --> 11:48.040
No, I said it isn't
medically safe to ejaculate.

11:48.845 --> 11:52.203
You see, that's funny 'cause I always
kinda put the two together.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.501
Jason, look.

11:53.548 --> 11:57.703
Semen can backflow into your bladder
and it can cause a whole bunch of things,

11:57.796 --> 12:01.342
especially a severe
urinary tract infection.

12:01.578 --> 12:04.063
You know, I like you
a lot, Francine, but...

12:05.878 --> 12:08.403
you really know how
to break a guy's heart.

12:08.808 --> 12:11.191
I'll check on you later, okay?

12:15.247 --> 12:17.703
Mrs. Kaster came
and talked to me today.

12:17.745 --> 12:20.072
I don't...oh, yeah.
How's the boy doing?

12:20.207 --> 12:23.402
Well, he's not doing very well.
You know, Reyes really did a number on him.

12:23.505 --> 12:26.401
I know. Listen, he's a good kid.
He just gets a little hot under the collar.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.501
A little hot under the collar?

12:27.546 --> 12:29.103
I mean, he put him
in a hospital, bad.

12:29.207 --> 12:30.001
I understand that.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.771
I guess I'm just a little
curious about what you think--

12:32.806 --> 12:35.000
You know, what you're going to
do about that whole situation.

12:35.097 --> 12:36.440
What do you mean, what am I
gonna do about it?

12:36.477 --> 12:37.903
Well, I mean,
I think you're in a position

12:38.006 --> 12:39.903
- where you might be able to--
- Wait, wait-- Let me ask a question.

12:39.945 --> 12:41.072
Who am I talking to right now?

12:41.108 --> 12:43.001
Am I talking to the guidance counselor,
or am I talking to my wife?

12:43.075 --> 12:45.501
- Oh, come on.
- I'm serious.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.103
What do you mean, I'm either speaking to you
as a guidance counselor,

12:47.208 --> 12:48.601
- as your wife.
- Sometimes I don't really know.

12:48.707 --> 12:50.100
It doesn't make a difference
how I'm speaking to you.

12:50.147 --> 12:51.801
Sometimes it does make--
There's something that I--

12:51.908 --> 12:52.903
Well, I'm just curious about
how you're--

12:53.008 --> 12:53.900
...involved in the situation.

12:53.945 --> 12:54.870
This is a very serious situation.

12:54.907 --> 12:56.241
Hey, honey.
How are you today?

12:56.276 --> 12:57.741
Hey, guys.
You all good?

12:57.777 --> 12:58.872
Gooood.

12:58.906 --> 13:00.101
You have a good day at school?

13:00.147 --> 13:01.202
Yeah, a blast.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.341
Here, I got you something.
I got you something.

13:02.475 --> 13:03.842
I got you an apple.

13:03.877 --> 13:05.002
Oh. Gee whiz.

13:05.048 --> 13:06.702
Apple of your daddy's eye.

13:15.275 --> 13:18.300
- Yeah?
- Hey, it's me.

13:26.075 --> 13:27.223
Hi.

13:28.277 --> 13:29.530
Thanks.

13:30.305 --> 13:31.503
Come on in.

13:31.606 --> 13:32.972
I just, you know,

13:33.505 --> 13:36.603
wanted to stop by to let you know
that Bart Oliver asked me out.

13:36.707 --> 13:38.771
- Bart?
- Hummm...

13:38.807 --> 13:40.602
He's a defensive end.

13:41.007 --> 13:43.200
Yeah, I know who he is.

13:44.247 --> 13:45.902
Well, you know, I just wanted
to give you a heads-up

13:46.007 --> 13:49.003
before anyone else ends up in the
hospital like that Kaster kid.

13:49.106 --> 13:51.042
Don't flatter yourself, Tyra.

13:51.577 --> 13:53.742
You know, I'm trying to be
the mature one here.

13:54.005 --> 13:56.600
- Douche bag.
- That's classy.

14:00.407 --> 14:01.440
Have a good day.

14:01.476 --> 14:03.772
You're such a jerk, Tim.
You know that?

14:04.507 --> 14:05.242
H ello?

14:05.475 --> 14:07.503
I need you to come down here, Timmy.

14:08.435 --> 14:09.103
J?

14:09.195 --> 14:10.861
There's something I gotta talk
to you about.

14:11.208 --> 14:13.153
Where?
The rehab center?

14:13.577 --> 14:14.800
Where do you think?

14:14.906 --> 14:16.840
Come on.
Just get down here, all right?

14:17.228 --> 14:18.900
Yeah, man.

14:25.006 --> 14:27.432
Well, i'm glad you called me on this, Eric.

14:27.526 --> 14:28.800
It's the right thing to do.

14:28.906 --> 14:30.952
I'll make sure this kid
gets a fair shake.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.080
He's a good kid.

14:32.126 --> 14:35.603
And the last thing this team needs
is having our star defensive player

14:35.788 --> 14:38.150
sitting over here in the jail.
Oh, and another thing.

14:38.217 --> 14:42.902
We may have to go back in again in front
of the Athletic Administration.

14:43.207 --> 14:43.900
What?

14:43.986 --> 14:47.303
Well, evidently, when they interviewed
Voodoo's family, somebody mentioned

14:47.405 --> 14:50.203
the "academic council"
we had with Voodoo.

14:50.305 --> 14:52.402
That's what you call that?
Academic council?

14:52.605 --> 14:54.352
Yeah.
The meeting we had.

14:54.408 --> 14:55.583
- Damn, Buddy.
- What?

14:55.657 --> 14:57.213
When did all this take place?

14:57.255 --> 15:00.651
Look, he has to have 30 days
of established residence

15:00.697 --> 15:02.901
- before he even puts a uniform on.
- Damn, Buddy.

15:03.008 --> 15:04.912
The meeting took place in July.

15:05.007 --> 15:07.001
The meeting took place two weeks ago.

15:07.008 --> 15:09.300
- Hey, don't worry about it, okay?
- Oh, don't worry about it.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.000
Every single team
in the district did exactly

15:12.066 --> 15:14.863
- the same thing that we did.
- Don't ask me to lie.

15:14.966 --> 15:16.603
I'm not gonna ask you to lie.

15:16.738 --> 15:20.001
Let's just solve this crisis
right now, okay? One crisis at a time.

15:20.106 --> 15:23.102
Let's take care of Reyes,
and then we'll do the other deal later.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.732
Made a mistake, Coach.

15:27.868 --> 15:30.763
I don't know what to do. I'm scared.

15:30.808 --> 15:32.360
Yeah, well, it sounds like
you made a mistake.

15:32.407 --> 15:34.700
Why don't you tell me exactly
what happened?

15:34.836 --> 15:38.500
We're at the sandwich shop.
Just there, you know, hanging out.

15:39.035 --> 15:41.392
We, uh--we were watching
the hearing on TV.

15:42.136 --> 15:43.363
I guess I was a little pissed.

15:43.775 --> 15:47.201
Then Voodoo comes in... comes right in,
like nothing even happened.

15:47.306 --> 15:49.902
All right, that's all great.
How'd the Kaster kid get involved?

15:50.006 --> 15:54.201
When that guy came on TV and said that
they were coming up with a decision,

15:54.407 --> 15:56.402
you know, we all got upset.

15:57.447 --> 16:00.061
Then that Kaster kid comes in
and he starts mouthing off

16:00.545 --> 16:03.803
about football players
and talking smack about the team.

16:04.268 --> 16:07.703
You know that no matter
what anyone says to you,

16:07.795 --> 16:11.192
that doesn't give you the right
to cause physical harm to them, don't you?

16:11.237 --> 16:13.500
- You understand that?
- Yeah, Coach.

16:13.608 --> 16:16.503
Then why would you be so stupid, son?

16:22.065 --> 16:22.920
Then I...

16:25.165 --> 16:27.500
Kaster kid called me a wetback.

16:27.938 --> 16:31.703
Well, that's not right.
I mean, that's just racist is what that is.

16:31.765 --> 16:34.362
He said I should go back to Mexico.

16:34.606 --> 16:36.232
I'm not even from Mexico, Coach.

16:36.268 --> 16:39.400
Anyway, I went outside afterwards

16:39.438 --> 16:41.560
and asked him to apologize
for what he said.

16:41.708 --> 16:43.431
He didn't want to apologize.

16:44.107 --> 16:46.803
So he goes up
and he tries to hit me.

16:46.907 --> 16:48.830
So we started fighting, Coach.

16:48.966 --> 16:53.601
He's trying to fight me. I fight back.
It just set me off so bad.

16:54.166 --> 16:57.502
I've been trying to control my temper.
You know I have, Coach.

16:58.367 --> 17:00.003
You're telling me the truth?

17:00.235 --> 17:02.301
- Yes, sir.
- You look me right in the eye.

17:02.398 --> 17:04.511
You tell me you're telling me the truth.

17:04.807 --> 17:06.942
Coach, I'm telling you the truth.

17:29.885 --> 17:30.710
Six.

17:32.606 --> 17:34.293
Took you long enough to get here, man.

17:34.398 --> 17:36.472
My truck ain't runnin'.

17:37.095 --> 17:40.423
We're putting in this
four-barrel carb.

17:40.555 --> 17:41.722
I hitched a ride, man.

17:41.958 --> 17:42.892
Sorry.

17:42.927 --> 17:45.221
I'm guessing you know
what this is about.

17:45.467 --> 17:48.003
- I do?
- Yeah, of course you do.

17:49.005 --> 17:50.301
You wanna call yourself
my best friend

17:50.407 --> 17:53.001
and you haven't shown up but once
since I've been in here.

17:53.196 --> 17:55.002
Six weeks, man.
Six weeks.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.060
Let me go ahead and recap my life for you
over the last couple of weeks, huh?

17:58.507 --> 18:00.693
My day starts out with me
laying down on this bed.

18:00.728 --> 18:03.203
Well, pretty much the whole day
takes place with me laying down

18:03.305 --> 18:05.091
on this bed on my sorry
quadriplegic ass.

18:05.428 --> 18:07.220
Every day, people come in here
and poke and prod at me

18:07.267 --> 18:08.792
like I'm a piece of meat.

18:08.826 --> 18:12.001
Go ahead and stick a catheter in me
in places you don't even want to know about.

18:12.195 --> 18:14.552
My big adventure of the day
is going to the commode.

18:14.705 --> 18:16.392
'Cause I gotta go
the same time every day

18:16.426 --> 18:19.063
so I can teach my body
how to crap on cue.

18:19.196 --> 18:20.422
Impressive, huh?

18:20.457 --> 18:22.591
And then Lyla comes running in.

18:23.298 --> 18:26.691
I wanna know if she's as chipper
out there as she is in here.

18:26.725 --> 18:29.000
'Cause I'll tell you what--
I love that girl... I do.

18:29.107 --> 18:31.501
I love her more than life itself.
But I'll tell you what.

18:31.607 --> 18:33.853
If she tells me how great
everything's gonna be when...

18:33.996 --> 18:36.752
I finally get out of here
one more time, I'm gonna lose it.

18:37.108 --> 18:38.323
Point is this, Timmy.

18:38.455 --> 18:42.023
While I'm in here dealing 
with all this, by myself,

18:42.066 --> 18:43.562
and my best friend's out there

18:43.996 --> 18:46.692
putting a four-barrel carb
in his damn truck.

18:46.727 --> 18:48.552
Is that what's important
right now?

18:49.895 --> 18:51.451
Answer me this, Timmy...

18:51.495 --> 18:54.202
What happened to Texas forever?
Huh?

18:54.267 --> 18:55.620
What happened to livin' large?

18:55.655 --> 18:57.122
What happened to that eternal bond

18:57.168 --> 18:58.350
that you used to love to throw
around when I was still health

18:58.397 --> 18:59.990
and headed towards the NFL, huh?

19:00.106 --> 19:04.603
I need you here, Tim.
I need you here.

19:05.097 --> 19:07.003
I expect...

19:08.206 --> 19:10.400
I expect you here.

19:11.505 --> 19:13.351
You are my best friend.

19:15.297 --> 19:17.501
Grace period's over.

19:19.966 --> 19:23.092
It's embarrassing for me to admit, but...

19:23.725 --> 19:25.062
before things got physical,

19:25.195 --> 19:28.290
Kurt Kaster called me
and my family racist names.

19:29.727 --> 19:31.591
Said I was a...

19:31.628 --> 19:34.321
A dirty wetback jock who should
go back over the border

19:34.358 --> 19:36.731
with my dirty wetback mom.

19:37.356 --> 19:39.852
I realize that--
that what I did was wrong.

19:40.196 --> 19:43.541
And that I should have responded
in a more mature way.

19:43.757 --> 19:46.751
I've been released on bail,
but the Kaster family

19:46.795 --> 19:48.823
is still pressing charges against me.

19:49.008 --> 19:51.721
I just wanted everyone to hear the truth.

19:51.755 --> 19:53.860
You know, directly from me.

19:53.998 --> 19:55.492
Thank you.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.961
I'm not buying his story.
I'm not buying that.

19:58.098 --> 19:59.462
What do you mean
you're not buying it?

19:59.505 --> 20:02.591
Kurt Kaster is a straight-A student.

20:02.625 --> 20:05.160
He's on the student mentoring program.

20:05.196 --> 20:06.790
And I talked to his mother.

20:06.825 --> 20:08.091
I just--
I just--

20:08.126 --> 20:11.621
I don't feel that he
would've said those things.

20:11.656 --> 20:13.690
Look, people--
they say stupid things.

20:13.726 --> 20:15.493
They're--they're teenagers.

20:15.525 --> 20:18.701
She just knew in her heart that
he didn't do it. I believed her.

20:18.797 --> 20:21.903
Look, I've known Reyes for a long time.
I've coached him for a long time.

20:22.008 --> 20:22.861
- Did you know that--
- He's not the kind of kid

20:22.898 --> 20:24.190
- he's got a record?
- That's gonna go and do something like that.

20:24.227 --> 20:26.062
Did you know that he's been arrested twice?

20:26.295 --> 20:29.792
Two burglaries, and one of them,
he resisted arrest.

20:29.826 --> 20:32.601
Well, he is a little bit--
He's had a tough upbringing.

20:32.698 --> 20:33.961
That's not what we're talking about.

20:33.995 --> 20:37.600
I'm not saying it was the right thing
for him to do-- beat the hell out of this kid.

20:37.728 --> 20:39.392
But he was obviously provoked.

20:39.505 --> 20:43.702
I would like for you to really look
at all sides of this thing.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.401
Of course I've looked at all sides of it, honey.
I'm just telling ya...

20:46.507 --> 20:48.301
I looked that kid right in the eye.
He's telling the truth.

20:48.905 --> 20:49.752
All right?

20:50.095 --> 20:52.120
I can tell.

20:54.106 --> 20:55.511
Hey, who you taking to homecoming?

20:55.626 --> 20:58.101
Man, you should take
that, uh, rally girl, Drew.

20:58.196 --> 21:00.892
Uh, no, I got--I got someone
else in mind, so--.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.003
Aw, man, quit stalling!
Come on.

21:03.025 --> 21:05.452
Hey, I bet your granny
still cut an ill two-step.

21:06.586 --> 21:08.021
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.

21:08.057 --> 21:09.620
Can I talk to you for a second?

21:09.657 --> 21:11.703
- Hey, what's up?
- What's up? What's going on?

21:11.786 --> 21:13.021
Reyes lied.

21:13.935 --> 21:15.763
Look, man, you weren't outside, okay?

21:15.787 --> 21:17.801
Neither of us were.
We don't know that for sure.

21:17.895 --> 21:19.893
Well I mean, we've known Kaster
since the seventh grade.

21:19.937 --> 21:21.263
I mean, he's not a racist.

21:21.296 --> 21:23.233
He's never said one racist thing.

21:23.266 --> 21:24.562
Voodoo's the one who said
all that stuff.

21:24.595 --> 21:26.902
Yeah, but it's over now, okay?
It's done.

21:26.967 --> 21:29.101
It's--It's not over.
I mean, you-- you can do something.

21:29.197 --> 21:31.103
- What am I supposed to do?
- You wanna make a statement?

21:31.235 --> 21:32.203
Call a press conference?

21:32.397 --> 21:33.963
I mean, you're the starting
quarterback, aren't you?

21:33.997 --> 21:35.232
Wait, I'm not--
I'm not Peyton Manning.

21:35.267 --> 21:36.761
I can't call a press conference.

21:36.798 --> 21:40.803
I've played three high school football games.
I haven't even started all of them.

21:48.866 --> 21:51.261
If we need to stop at 12 we can.

21:51.297 --> 21:53.303
- I can do 15.
- Okay.

21:55.165 --> 21:56.590
J. Street.

21:58.467 --> 22:00.031
- Hey, uh, Kristen?
- Yeah?

22:00.107 --> 22:02.761
Could we, uh...
Could we get just a couple minutes?

22:02.897 --> 22:03.962
Sure.

22:04.197 --> 22:05.732
Can you spot him so he
can't--doesn't fall forward?

22:05.768 --> 22:07.301
- Yes, ma'am.
- He just got his brace off.

22:07.406 --> 22:10.401
Put one hand right there.
There you go.

22:10.898 --> 22:13.100
And you do it slow.
There you go.

22:13.498 --> 22:14.633
Thank you.

22:15.208 --> 22:18.501
Brace off today.
How nice. Congrats.

22:23.436 --> 22:26.203
What say you and me
get out of here later?

22:26.295 --> 22:28.362
Yeah, great idea.

22:28.797 --> 22:32.001
- Where do you think we're gonna go?
- I got some ideas.

22:32.238 --> 22:34.633
Tell you what,
anywhere but here, man.

22:34.965 --> 22:36.120
It smells.

22:37.297 --> 22:40.303
It smells like a hospital, man.
I hate hospitals.

22:40.366 --> 22:42.591
All right, genius, when--
when are we doing this?

22:42.936 --> 22:45.333
I'm thinking tonight.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.063
Let's do it.

22:54.358 --> 22:55.302
I'm not lying.

22:55.585 --> 22:56.612
Hey--

22:56.655 --> 22:58.510
You wanna coach big time
high school football?

22:58.856 --> 23:02.011
'Cause that's what every single
one of these coaches does.

23:02.157 --> 23:03.400
This is part of the deal.

23:03.505 --> 23:05.612
You wanna coach,
you better get ready for this.

23:05.656 --> 23:08.403
This is just the way it is,
and I don't like it any more than you do.

23:08.518 --> 23:09.712
So get it together.

23:09.756 --> 23:12.332
Let's go in there and get this done.

23:15.056 --> 23:16.882
Gentlemen, thank you for coming.

23:17.016 --> 23:20.152
My God, Taylor.
Forrest frickin' Aiken.

23:20.317 --> 23:22.181
- How are you, man?
- Good to see ya.

23:22.216 --> 23:23.453
Good to see you, Buddy.
How's Pam?

23:23.486 --> 23:26.000
She's fine, she's fine.
How about yours?

23:26.088 --> 23:27.352
Doin' well. Keeping me in line.

23:27.385 --> 23:28.380
Yes, sir.

23:28.415 --> 23:30.601
Listen, have a seat, have a seat.
Yeah. I can't believe it's you.

23:30.687 --> 23:32.180
Hey, Coach, this is my old buddy--

23:32.218 --> 23:34.402
- Forrest Aiken.
- Hi, how are you doing?

23:34.457 --> 23:36.612
We played football together at UT.

23:36.695 --> 23:38.411
Played defense.

23:38.758 --> 23:41.701
- Coach, how you doin'?
- Uh, just fine. Everything's going just fine.

23:41.856 --> 23:44.702
You know, Coach, I hate that
you're having to go through all this.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.003
And I'm sure you'd rather be spending
time with your boys right now.

23:47.055 --> 23:48.481
I know you got a big game
this Friday night.

23:48.517 --> 23:50.483
Yes, a big one coming up.
That's for sure.

23:50.517 --> 23:54.100
Well, I've looked through this and, uh,
let's cut through all the hoopla.

23:54.185 --> 23:55.512
- Oh.
- Yeah, let's--

23:55.557 --> 23:58.501
- Let's settle this matter.
- That sounds good to me.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.112
I feel real comfortable with it.

24:00.195 --> 24:01.580
I've looked over it
and I feel real good about it.

24:01.617 --> 24:05.201
- I think everything's gonna be just fine.
- That's good.

24:06.616 --> 24:08.252
Attention please.

24:08.288 --> 24:11.583
Assistant Principal Trucks here
with a little news update.

24:11.617 --> 24:14.911
The ruling just came down from
the Athletic Administration.

24:14.956 --> 24:18.983
Ray Tatom was deemed eligible
to play in last week's game.

24:19.015 --> 24:22.900
This means the Panther victory
over Arnett Mead still stands.

24:22.987 --> 24:23.932
Oh, yeah!

24:42.177 --> 24:44.103
State! State! State!

24:44.146 --> 24:45.851
Just reach behind me and lift.

24:45.907 --> 24:46.800
- Ready?
- Yep.

24:48.507 --> 24:50.372
Why don't you save some of that Jell-O

24:50.407 --> 24:52.070
for the other patients, Street?

24:52.106 --> 24:53.943
You kidding me?

24:53.976 --> 24:55.503
- You good?
- I'm in.

24:55.547 --> 24:56.540
I'm in, I'm in.

24:56.875 --> 24:58.871
Just swing my legs around.

24:59.008 --> 25:00.543
Okay, I got you.

25:00.678 --> 25:01.870
What is going on?

25:03.947 --> 25:06.552
- Field trip.
- Field trip?

25:06.646 --> 25:07.572
Yeah.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.001
Who did you clear this with?

25:09.205 --> 25:11.001
Street.

25:12.076 --> 25:14.003
Can I talk to you for a second?

25:14.746 --> 25:16.041
Yes.

25:16.078 --> 25:17.272
Go easy on him, boss.

25:18.976 --> 25:22.702
- Tim, what are you doing?
- We're going on a little ride.

25:22.797 --> 25:24.603
Going on a little ride?

25:24.848 --> 25:26.041
Yes.

25:33.076 --> 25:35.441
You ready to rock and roll?

25:35.676 --> 25:36.772
Hold on just a second.

25:37.207 --> 25:38.671
Lyla...

25:39.106 --> 25:39.670
Come with us.

25:39.708 --> 25:42.203
No, no. You guys go.

25:42.245 --> 25:44.270
I'll be behind you
with the police brigade.

25:44.405 --> 25:47.403
Come here. Come here.

25:50.605 --> 25:52.900
Let's just for once let
the rules go, all right?

25:52.945 --> 25:55.141
I need this.
You know I need this.

25:56.645 --> 25:58.270
Come on.

26:01.075 --> 26:02.172
You guys are crazy.

26:02.207 --> 26:05.002
Timmy, let her in.
She's coming along.

26:10.805 --> 26:15.272
<i>A man named Gene's
got a beautiful voice</i>

26:15.305 --> 26:16.802
You know how great this is?

26:16.848 --> 26:21.001
Me, you, Riggs, open road, fresh air.

26:21.578 --> 26:23.273
No hospitals.

26:23.406 --> 26:24.801
Man, did I need this.

26:24.848 --> 26:27.371
<i>Just sing me a song</i>

26:27.406 --> 26:28.973
<i>And if it's sad</i>

26:29.005 --> 26:31.401
<i>I'll sing along,
long, long</i>

26:31.447 --> 26:35.140
<i>I told you
I knew every word</i>

26:35.378 --> 26:37.600
- And a straw.
- Don't forget the straw!

26:37.775 --> 26:40.003
Don't forget the straw!

26:42.408 --> 26:44.272
I'm really glad you came, babe.

26:45.005 --> 26:46.372
Me too.

26:54.907 --> 26:56.641
I, uh...

26:56.975 --> 26:59.000
Running a little low on the cash.

26:59.605 --> 27:01.200
What a surprise.

27:02.308 --> 27:04.271
- Be right back.
- Ok.

27:09.605 --> 27:11.201
I don't want this to be awkward.

27:11.296 --> 27:13.103
Well maybe we can start
by you not shoving

27:13.206 --> 27:14.952
your tongue down his throat, Lyla.

27:15.007 --> 27:16.700
I can't take all the blame for this.

27:16.805 --> 27:18.300
Oh, and here I thought you
were taking responsibility.

27:18.407 --> 27:19.301
Oh, shut up, Tim.

27:19.948 --> 27:22.001
Lyla, look--

27:22.607 --> 27:26.603
It's J's night, all right?
Let's just get through this for him.

27:32.278 --> 27:33.272
You ready?

27:35.976 --> 27:37.070
Uh!

27:37.107 --> 27:39.702
You ain't in game shape,
are you, Streeter?

27:39.947 --> 27:42.403
How are you supposed to carry your team?
You can't even carry me.

27:42.497 --> 27:43.743
Maybe I should just
get rid of the chair

27:43.776 --> 27:45.803
and have you carry me around everywhere.

27:47.008 --> 27:48.742
Street!

27:48.975 --> 27:51.241
Here you go.
Two burgers, straight up.

27:53.378 --> 27:55.802
- Hey, picking up for Taylor.
- Sure, one minute.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.071
Thank you.

27:57.858 --> 27:58.542
Hey.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.002
Hey.

28:00.508 --> 28:02.500
So where's the other one?

28:05.375 --> 28:06.803
Ah.
Trouble in paradise.

28:07.506 --> 28:09.073
It's this whole Reyes thing.

28:09.307 --> 28:11.901
You mean the guy who nearly
killed the other kid

28:11.976 --> 28:14.903
but nobody's gonna do anything about it
because he plays football?

28:15.005 --> 28:16.773
So I guess that puts you
on his side?

28:16.908 --> 28:18.570
No, it...

28:19.005 --> 28:21.243
I just think you should man up
and talk to him.

28:21.275 --> 28:24.142
I mean, you two look pretty
pathetic without each other.

28:25.477 --> 28:27.503
There you go, hon.
Do you need any utensils?

28:27.648 --> 28:29.742
Uh, no, I'm good.
Thanks.

28:37.746 --> 28:40.473
All right, look, I thought about
what you said, all right?

28:41.105 --> 28:42.071
And?

28:42.105 --> 28:45.970
And I think, well, you're not really
recognizing my position in all this.

28:46.175 --> 28:47.800
Look--I'm under a lot of pressure.

28:47.848 --> 28:51.202
I'm supposed to lead this team.
They're depending on me.

28:51.475 --> 28:54.700
I just can't make accusations
about my teammates.

28:54.776 --> 28:57.042
You're Matt Saracen.
QB1, right?

28:57.145 --> 29:00.670
Look, can you just cut me some slack?
You're supposed to be my best friend, okay?

29:01.008 --> 29:02.600
Fine, all right?

29:02.848 --> 29:07.303
Reyes--Reyes is a crazy son of a bitch,
but he's key to our defense.

29:07.545 --> 29:08.603
We're relying on him.

29:08.678 --> 29:11.071
He also assaulted
one of our friends.

29:11.675 --> 29:15.003
Or do you not have time to think about that
with all the pressures and everything?

29:15.978 --> 29:17.300
Lovers spat?

29:17.397 --> 29:19.200
Look, not now, Reyes, all right?

29:21.208 --> 29:22.443
What's wrong?

29:23.377 --> 29:24.372
Where are you going?

29:24.708 --> 29:25.471
Home.

29:25.606 --> 29:26.970
Did I upset you?

29:28.008 --> 29:29.300
- Just leave him alone.
- What's wrong with him?

29:29.348 --> 29:30.841
Just leave him alone, okay?

29:30.977 --> 29:35.270
I mean, do you realize that if you weren't
a Panther you'd be in jail right now?

29:35.546 --> 29:37.901
- Excuse me?
- He didn't say nothing.

29:38.096 --> 29:39.900
You assaulted Kaster.

29:40.047 --> 29:42.402
And you just think that you're gonna
get away with it, don't you?

29:42.505 --> 29:44.002
You better watch what you're saying, man.
Seriously.

29:44.105 --> 29:46.500
I'm not afraid of you.
If that's what you think.

29:46.708 --> 29:48.840
What are you talking about?

29:54.808 --> 29:56.000
Reyes..

30:00.578 --> 30:02.102
You're not worth it, man.

30:07.275 --> 30:08.102
Hey--

30:08.508 --> 30:09.502
Landry!

30:13.005 --> 30:14.543
Get him off me!

30:15.978 --> 30:17.300
Lay off me!

30:17.347 --> 30:18.743
Come on, man!

30:19.076 --> 30:21.400
Go home! You don't need this!
Okay?

30:21.877 --> 30:23.742
Just stop!

30:26.077 --> 30:27.271
Just go home!

30:28.705 --> 30:31.140
You know what?
Kaster was right about you.

30:31.278 --> 30:34.503
You did cross over.
You're one of them. Congratulations.

30:53.737 --> 30:56.230
I could be out here
all night listening to this.

30:56.328 --> 30:58.063
Just nothin'...

31:07.595 --> 31:10.753
Congratulations on the Voodoo decision.

31:10.996 --> 31:13.090
You know it could've gone
the other way, don't you?

31:13.126 --> 31:15.191
Why, exactly?

31:15.326 --> 31:19.803
You go with Buddy Garrity
out to a seedy little motel

31:20.505 --> 31:24.802
to meet a kid named Voodoo.
Along with a manager.

31:24.925 --> 31:28.801
And then ol' Buddy,
he starts promising things.

31:28.855 --> 31:31.502
- What kind of things?
- He starts promising things.

31:31.998 --> 31:33.922
But you didn't do that, sugar?

31:34.607 --> 31:41.202
I think sometimes that for anyone to do
what I do it is damn near impossible

31:41.328 --> 31:44.823
to not to sell your soul just
a little bit down the river.

31:45.007 --> 31:47.450
Think you just keep doing
what you're doing, Coach.

31:47.495 --> 31:51.895
- Taking it one day at a time.
- You know what I really love?

31:51.895 --> 31:53.492
Mm-hmm.

31:53.525 --> 31:54.593
I love football.

31:55.898 --> 31:58.652
- I love football.
- I know.

31:58.955 --> 32:00.353
I love those kids.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.193
Hey, Matt.

32:08.225 --> 32:13.301
- Hi, Julie. H--how's it going?
- Um, not bad.

32:13.456 --> 32:14.903
How was dance rehearsals?

32:15.008 --> 32:18.000
Dance--It's--
It's going really good, you know.

32:18.098 --> 32:21.203
We have, uh, like,
three practices a week now.

32:21.295 --> 32:23.820
Um, the girls are doing
really good, so...

32:23.897 --> 32:25.393
- That's good.
- Yeah.

32:26.006 --> 32:28.190
Uh, is--Is your dad around?

32:28.227 --> 32:30.352
Uh, yeah, yeah.

32:31.755 --> 32:34.320
Um... Dad, Saracen's here.

32:37.627 --> 32:38.720
What's going on?

32:39.505 --> 32:40.320
You all right?

32:40.626 --> 32:42.003
Yeah.

32:45.796 --> 32:46.792
What's up?

32:47.108 --> 32:49.651
Kaster didn't say anything racist.

32:49.897 --> 32:52.021
Thought you said you weren't outside.

32:52.155 --> 32:53.053
I wasn't.

32:53.398 --> 32:55.951
I--I was inside, but...

32:56.098 --> 32:57.651
But I know Kaster.

32:57.998 --> 33:01.502
I've known him a long time, and I don't think
he would say anything like that.

33:02.456 --> 33:04.820
And besides, that wasn't really
the way it was going anyway.

33:05.057 --> 33:08.000
Voodoo's the one who called
Reyes a wetback.

33:08.926 --> 33:09.850
Not Kaster.

33:10.506 --> 33:14.653
And I think Reyes was probably just ...
all riled up...after that.

33:14.757 --> 33:19.000
And then Kaster was just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

33:20.625 --> 33:23.350
I know I should've said something sooner.

33:23.896 --> 33:27.720
I think I might've been confused
between what was right for the team and what...

33:29.425 --> 33:30.650
And what was right.

33:30.696 --> 33:33.593
Anyway...
sorry I bothered you.

33:33.627 --> 33:35.253
Good night, Coach.

33:35.495 --> 33:36.450
Hey, Matt.

33:39.006 --> 33:41.171
Tell your grandmother
I say hello.

33:42.096 --> 33:43.761
I will.

33:45.428 --> 33:46.850
Good night.

33:52.407 --> 33:53.952
Hey, I'm Coach Taylor.

33:54.295 --> 33:56.023
Yeah, I know who you are.

33:56.605 --> 33:59.523
I was wondering if, uh,
if I could talk to Kurt.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.602
Please.

34:03.007 --> 34:04.761
Hey there, son.

34:13.857 --> 34:16.290
I want to apologize for what happened.

34:16.525 --> 34:17.902
When I get back to school,

34:18.005 --> 34:22.003
every football player's gonna have a
piece of me on a daily basis.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.250
Thanks for the apology, Coach.

34:24.397 --> 34:27.533
I can guarantee you no football
player's gonna come near you.

34:28.206 --> 34:32.101
There is no excuse
what Bobby Reyes did to you.

34:39.925 --> 34:44.000
Remember when we were just junior high
schoolers, Street, sneaking down here?

34:44.355 --> 34:46.500
Dreaming about playing varsity?

34:46.797 --> 34:49.322
You know, things have changed, Tim.

34:49.456 --> 34:51.091
We're still getting
that hunting ranch, Street.

34:51.125 --> 34:55.603
Yeah, and how are we gonna do that
without my NFL money and your whopping 1%?

34:55.697 --> 34:59.500
That's just it.
I think I'm gonna go pro.

35:01.507 --> 35:02.891
You think you can do that?

35:03.028 --> 35:03.892
No.

35:06.558 --> 35:08.003
Nope.

35:09.027 --> 35:11.653
But, I mean, that's just
the money part anyways.

35:11.896 --> 35:13.893
We can figure that out.

35:14.258 --> 35:18.791
Best friends, right? Wasn't that
always more important than football?

35:18.907 --> 35:20.393
No.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.650
Not always.

35:25.297 --> 35:27.120
It is now.

35:27.455 --> 35:28.990
Three of us.

35:29.126 --> 35:32.923
We'll rise up.
Together.

35:33.525 --> 35:35.822
Get through anything.

35:37.055 --> 35:38.252
Anything at all.

35:53.227 --> 35:54.332
Have a seat.

36:01.686 --> 36:02.951
What's up, Coach?

36:04.538 --> 36:08.203
I was down there trying to help you,
and you looked me right in the eye and you lied.

36:10.927 --> 36:12.893
I'm not wrong, am I?

36:16.328 --> 36:18.621
Can you even admit the truth?

36:18.766 --> 36:21.260
That boy didn't call you
any names, did he?

36:23.095 --> 36:24.290
No, sir.

36:24.328 --> 36:26.502
You went and you beat the hell
out of that kid

36:26.608 --> 36:29.620
and then you made up a lie
and ditched everything onto him.

36:29.667 --> 36:32.220
That's a hell of a position
you put me in, isn't it?

36:32.267 --> 36:35.300
Come on, Coach. I had to lie, Coach.
You know I had to lie.

36:35.395 --> 36:36.720
I was scared, Coach.

36:36.868 --> 36:40.103
You need to pack up your personals and clear
out your locker. You're off the team.

36:40.196 --> 36:41.802
You can't do that to me, Coach.

36:41.867 --> 36:44.821
Football's all I got.
You screwed yourself real good.

36:44.867 --> 36:47.533
I believe in you,
but I cannot help you here.

36:47.566 --> 36:50.100
You are on your own at this point
and I'm gonna tell you what I suggest.

36:50.265 --> 36:51.992
You go over to the guidance counselor office

36:52.025 --> 36:55.391
and you start working on your anger problems.

36:55.537 --> 36:58.193
There's nothing else
I can do for you.

37:03.066 --> 37:04.822
Go clear it out.

37:13.025 --> 37:15.590
Hold your water, lineman!
Hold your water! Here we go.

37:16.006 --> 37:16.962
Hut!

37:21.798 --> 37:25.402
- Aw, come on, Matt.
- Come on, let's go!

37:25.536 --> 37:26.962
- Nice play, Voodoo.
- Take a break, Matt.

37:27.098 --> 37:28.323
Hey, get in here.

37:28.668 --> 37:29.292
Coach--

37:29.928 --> 37:31.360
Coach, why you got me
playing D?

37:31.396 --> 37:32.793
Get back to practice, son.

37:32.827 --> 37:36.167
All due respect, I got a state ring sitting
in my drawer and it's not for defense.

37:36.167 --> 37:39.390
With all due respect, you can go
sit on that bench if you like.

37:41.206 --> 37:42.223
Hustle up, guys!

37:51.437 --> 37:53.291
Guess who came in for counseling today.

37:55.367 --> 37:56.620
Bobby Reyes.
