00:19.152 --> 00:20.983
It's alive!

00:39.406 --> 00:40.737
Flip the switch!

00:40.774 --> 00:43.208
The governor just called!
This man is innocent!

00:43.243 --> 00:45.074
- Aw.
- Boo.

00:45.111 --> 00:48.308
All right, show of hands.
Flip it anyway?

00:48.348 --> 00:49.713
Wait, wait! What?!

00:51.618 --> 00:52.710
Kill him!

01:04.563 --> 01:06.361
7-Mary-3 in pursuit of...
Hold on!

01:09.035 --> 01:12.232
Whoo-hoo! <i>TRL</i> is awesome!
I love Sway!

01:12.272 --> 01:14.240
<i>TRL</i> in Times Square
on MTV is the best!

01:14.274 --> 01:15.901
Sway rules!
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

01:15.942 --> 01:18.570
Welcome back to <i>TRL.</i>
As I promised...

01:18.611 --> 01:20.943
I present to you Usher!

01:20.980 --> 01:22.345
Oh, my gosh! I love Usher!

01:22.382 --> 01:27.547
Whoo-hoo! Usher's awesome!
He doesn't wear a shirt...

01:27.587 --> 01:29.077
Whoo-hoo! All right, guys,
I'll see you later!

01:29.122 --> 01:31.090
Whoo-hoo!
To Grand Central Station!

01:31.124 --> 01:32.716
Whoo-hoo! People call it
Grand Central Station...

01:32.759 --> 01:34.124
but it's really
Grand Central Terminal!

01:34.160 --> 01:35.252
It's awesome! Whoo-hoo!

01:35.295 --> 01:36.819
Whoo-hoo! Keep the change!

01:36.863 --> 01:38.490
Foreign cabbies rock!
The fare was $7...

01:38.531 --> 01:40.089
and I totally gave him 10,
and that's awesome!

01:40.133 --> 01:41.691
'Cause immigrants need money!
Whoo-hoo!

01:41.734 --> 01:43.395
Metro North's
Hudson River line rules!

01:43.436 --> 01:46.496
I saved $5 on a monthly pass.
And somebody smells! Whoo-hoo!

01:46.539 --> 01:48.507
Whoo-hoo! Mom's mashed potatoes
are the greatest!

01:48.541 --> 01:50.065
There's some carrots and peas
in there, too!

01:50.110 --> 01:51.737
Mom and Dad aren't fighting
tonight, and that's awesome!

01:51.778 --> 01:53.302
I already finished my homework.
That rocks! Whoo-hoo!

01:53.346 --> 01:55.143
Whoo-hoo!
I'm all tucked into bed...

01:55.181 --> 01:57.240
and I said my nightly prayers,
'cause God is awesome!

01:57.283 --> 01:59.615
Whoo-hoo! And now I'm gonna
drift off to sleep 'cause I'm...

01:59.652 --> 02:00.949
dreaming...

02:00.987 --> 02:03.148
I gotta... whoo-hoo.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.123
Gotta... go to bed...

02:05.158 --> 02:06.716
whoo-hoo.

02:06.759 --> 02:09.091
Whoo. Hoo.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.154
More butter! More butter!

02:11.197 --> 02:12.892
More butter! Oh, yeah! Yeah!

02:12.932 --> 02:16.095
Give it, give it, give it!
I gotta put it in my...

02:18.938 --> 02:21.532
Oh, yeah, butter!

02:27.814 --> 02:29.611
Excuse me,
but if your people...

02:29.649 --> 02:31.549
built this wall
to keep King Kong out...

02:31.584 --> 02:34.678
well, then why build a door
large enough for him to get through?

02:43.363 --> 02:45.957
For that matter,
kong's a giant monkey.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.433
I mean, why can't he just
climb over the wall?

02:52.906 --> 02:54.601
The new fall TV season
is starting...

02:54.641 --> 02:57.337
and <i>The Insider</i> has the scoop
on all the new series.

02:57.377 --> 03:00.403
P.S. To the competition...
go [Bleep] yourselves.

03:00.446 --> 03:02.937
This year's <i>Amazing Race</i>
will be more amazing than ever...

03:02.982 --> 03:05.576
now that religious deities
are joining the action.

03:05.618 --> 03:08.143
Oh, Jesus, please help us!

03:08.188 --> 03:09.849
Jesus!

03:09.889 --> 03:10.981
I'm here.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.889
I've brought you
a tire iron, my son.

03:12.926 --> 03:14.325
Praise Jesus!

03:14.360 --> 03:16.555
Mr. Christ,
please help steer this camel.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.588
Oh, Lord Jesus, we could
really go for some cab fare.

03:19.632 --> 03:22.362
Whoo-hoo!
Buddha's the way to go, jackass!

03:22.402 --> 03:24.802
Buddha's all up in your grill!

03:24.837 --> 03:27.635
Tired of their liberal shenanigans,
FOX owner Rupert Murdoch...

03:27.674 --> 03:29.335
fired <i>Simpsons</i> creator
Matt Groening...

03:29.375 --> 03:32.401
and promises same show,
brand new attitude this season.

03:32.445 --> 03:33.969
Morning, Apu.

03:34.013 --> 03:36.277
One order of freedom fries,
please.

03:36.316 --> 03:38.546
Oh, for the love
of my heathen god.

03:38.585 --> 03:41.520
They're called french fries,
you fat, stupid American!

03:41.554 --> 03:43.852
Department of homeland security!
Don't move!

03:43.890 --> 03:45.824
But...

03:45.858 --> 03:48.053
Happy birthday, America!

03:48.094 --> 03:50.460
Mmm. I hope Apu
has learned his lesson.

03:50.496 --> 03:53.158
I am so sorry
I ever dared question...

03:53.199 --> 03:56.862
the wisdom and strength
of the United States of America.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.236
Damn straight! Yee-haw!

04:00.273 --> 04:03.299
Uh-oh. J-Lo's new beau
is a no-go on the phone-o.

04:03.343 --> 04:05.937
But take it from P.O.,
her new line of Day-Glo Faygo...

04:05.979 --> 04:07.708
will make fans say, "Ho-o-o!"

04:07.747 --> 04:09.305
And now we enter day three...

04:09.349 --> 04:11.112
of our Kirsten Dunst
headache watch.

04:11.150 --> 04:14.085
Kiki's representatives insist
the megastar is just fine...

04:14.120 --> 04:15.815
but eyewitness accounts
say otherwise.

04:15.855 --> 04:17.914
I saw Kirsten Dunst
in the duty-free store...

04:17.957 --> 04:20.687
buying Tylenol... a lot of it.

04:20.726 --> 04:22.752
Even medical experts agree.

04:22.795 --> 04:24.262
Well, a headache
could be indicative...

04:24.297 --> 04:26.891
of a failed movie deal.
Or possibly a pregnancy!

04:26.933 --> 04:28.901
Time now
for celebrity birthdays.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.460
<i>Diff'rent Strokes</i> star
Conrad Bain is 82.

04:31.504 --> 04:35.702
Adult film star Ron Jeremy
is 69.

04:35.742 --> 04:39.234
And comedy trailblazer
Fatty Arbuckle is 118.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.713
At least he would be
if he wasn't [Bleep] worm food.

04:41.748 --> 04:43.613
In your face, Fatty Arbuckle...

04:43.650 --> 04:46.118
you fat, filthy, [Bleep],
[Bleep], [Bleep], [Bleep]...

04:46.152 --> 04:47.380
fat [Bleep] [Bleep]!

04:47.420 --> 04:49.354
Finally tonight, the fans
have been waiting for weeks...

04:49.389 --> 04:52.916
to learn the winner of our
Win Russell Crowe's Trash Contest.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.689
The grand prize goes
to Mrs. Carmelita Caylo...

04:55.728 --> 04:57.093
of Nyack, New York.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.765
Oh, it's here!
It's here! It's here!

04:59.799 --> 05:00.925
Oh, oh!

05:00.967 --> 05:04.801
It's Russell Crowe's underwear!

05:04.837 --> 05:08.671
Oh, hallelujah!

05:11.244 --> 05:14.213
Hey, hey, hey. A little help?

05:16.816 --> 05:20.445
Ladies, can I interest you
in some big balls?

05:21.621 --> 05:24.681
Aw, I'm so ugly and fat!

05:24.724 --> 05:26.487
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

05:26.526 --> 05:28.687
So, who does what now?

05:31.798 --> 05:33.698
I'm gonna [Bleep] that pig.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.667
Here I come, baby.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.010
Today, my son,
you will become a man.

05:45.044 --> 05:47.274
You're gonna teach me
how to kill, Papa?

05:47.313 --> 05:49.076
No, more important than that.

05:49.115 --> 05:51.379
I'm going to teach you
to poop on things.

05:51.417 --> 05:54.818
I'm ready, Papa. I had
spicy sausage for breakfast.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.687
Oh, excellent.
Now, who do you think...

05:57.724 --> 05:59.555
will make your best target?

06:01.594 --> 06:03.323
On that man's head, Papa?

06:03.363 --> 06:06.059
No, son.
Now, that is too obvious.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.124
Pick again.

06:09.335 --> 06:10.893
In there, Papa?

06:10.937 --> 06:15.704
No, my son. For he is a child,
and children are innocent.

06:15.742 --> 06:18.404
On the expensive
sports car, Papa?

06:18.444 --> 06:20.912
No, no. For it is white...

06:20.947 --> 06:23.279
and our poop would not
show up well on it.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.147
Think harder, my son.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.884
In there, Papa.

06:33.926 --> 06:36.724
Yes, yes, my son!
Excellent! Excellent!

06:36.763 --> 06:38.230
Now, let me see what you can do!

06:38.264 --> 06:39.288
OK.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.965
Did I do good, Papa?

06:49.008 --> 06:51.203
Yes. Yes, my son.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.008
You made me very proud.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.879
And come on! I mean,
there can't just be one Kong.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.281
There's got to be others.

06:58.317 --> 06:59.443
La la la, I can't hear you!

06:59.485 --> 07:02.010
That's not another monkey
climbing over the wall, la la!

07:05.258 --> 07:06.486
- Excuse me.
- Ass!

07:06.526 --> 07:08.323
One side. Smurfing through.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.795
Papa Smurf needs
to see me right away.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.321
- Official business.
- Douche.

07:14.667 --> 07:16.225
Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf!

07:16.269 --> 07:18.260
I smurfed here
as fast as I could.

07:18.304 --> 07:21.831
Brainy, Baker Smurf
has been murdered!

07:21.874 --> 07:23.171
But... but... but how?!

07:32.018 --> 07:34.680
I was right on the verge
for a while...

07:34.720 --> 07:37.120
but then seeing you
do it made me...

07:38.157 --> 07:40.751
Someone stuffed Baker
with cream filling...

07:40.793 --> 07:45.560
until he was ready to burst,
then smurfed him at 350 degrees.

07:45.598 --> 07:48.328
This could not be more horrible.

07:52.672 --> 07:54.264
I stand corrected.

07:54.307 --> 07:55.399
What's going on, Brainy?

07:55.441 --> 07:59.002
It is my solemn duty
to inform you...

07:59.045 --> 08:02.014
that Baker Smurf
has been smurfed.

08:04.116 --> 08:08.348
More importantly, Papa Smurf
has placed me in charge...

08:08.387 --> 08:09.877
of the investigation.

08:09.922 --> 08:11.947
Papa Smurf is always right...

08:11.991 --> 08:15.620
and Papa Smurf knows I'm
the most educated Smurf, so it...

08:18.164 --> 08:20.291
Mothersmurfer.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.096
How do I never see that coming?

08:24.337 --> 08:26.771
You're the most likely suspect,
Gargamel.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.239
Preposterous!

08:28.274 --> 08:32.073
I want to turn Smurfs into gold,
not kill them.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.841
I thought you wanted
to eat the Smurfs.

08:34.881 --> 08:38.111
Actually, I've never been
all that clear on my motivations.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.311
At any rate,
I just got back from Branson...

08:40.352 --> 08:41.820
so my alibi is solid.

08:41.854 --> 08:44.880
If Gargamel didn't do it,
who did?

08:44.924 --> 08:47.449
Brainy, there's been
another murder!

08:49.262 --> 08:51.628
[Bleep] smurfing [Bleep]!

08:53.132 --> 08:54.827
The comb is in his...

08:57.236 --> 08:59.170
And... and the lipstick is...

09:01.007 --> 09:02.474
I can't look!

09:02.508 --> 09:06.274
Wait a minute. Baker Smurf
was a fat-assed pig in life.

09:06.312 --> 09:08.303
And look how he died.

09:08.347 --> 09:11.111
Vanity was a primping,
preening pretty-boy.

09:11.150 --> 09:13.141
Gluttony, vanity.

09:13.185 --> 09:17.747
Lazy Smurf was horrifically
mutilated in his Barcalounger.

09:17.790 --> 09:18.916
Sloth.

09:18.958 --> 09:22.394
Our killer is mimicking
the seven deadly sins.

09:22.428 --> 09:24.589
But what sins still remain?

09:24.630 --> 09:26.689
The sin of lust, for one.

09:26.732 --> 09:27.994
Papa, Brainy...

09:28.034 --> 09:30.127
Chronic Masturbator Smurf
was just found...

09:30.169 --> 09:33.605
with his wang chopped off
and stuffed up his Smurf hole!

09:33.639 --> 09:36.665
But we still don't have
any suspects.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.574
Go get Smurfette.
Maybe a little massage...

09:38.611 --> 09:40.306
will help us concentrate.

09:40.346 --> 09:42.940
- Happy ending?
- Happy ending.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.975
Smurfette?

09:46.018 --> 09:47.508
Hello?

09:52.992 --> 09:54.482
Smurfette, are you here?

09:54.527 --> 09:56.722
Oh, Brainy!

09:56.762 --> 09:59.890
Hi, Brainy.

09:59.932 --> 10:03.925
Oh, no, Jokey.
Your sick sense of humor...

10:03.970 --> 10:07.906
your total disregard
for Smurf safety...

10:07.940 --> 10:11.876
your <i>Se7en</i> movie
trading card collection.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.003
You're the killer!

10:13.045 --> 10:15.013
I got you a present!

10:15.047 --> 10:18.073
What's in the box, Jokey?
What's in the box?

10:18.117 --> 10:20.176
It's a surprise!

10:22.555 --> 10:23.954
No!

10:23.990 --> 10:27.016
Oh, Smurfette, no!

10:28.995 --> 10:30.860
Surprise!

10:32.965 --> 10:35.058
What the [Bleep]
is wrong with you?

10:38.404 --> 10:39.962
Nice work, Brainy.

10:40.006 --> 10:42.566
Now we just gotta find her body.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.773
Just because
you're a headless corpse...

10:45.811 --> 10:48.541
doesn't mean we can't have
some fun, Smurfette.
