WEBVTT

00:00.549 --> 00:02.416
She really is amazing.

00:02.451 --> 00:03.417
(Glenn)
That is not

00:03.452 --> 00:05.286
this challenge.

00:05.320 --> 00:07.088
I'm really impressed.

00:07.122 --> 00:08.789
(McKenzie)
Previously on <i> Face Off,</i>

00:08.824 --> 00:12.226
Darla's alien beauty queen
earned her her first win.

00:12.261 --> 00:13.794
But Kelly was eliminated,

00:13.829 --> 00:16.697
leaving Team Anthony
with just one artist.

00:19.668 --> 00:21.702
Now seven artists remain,

00:21.737 --> 00:23.938
and tonight their skills
will be tested

00:23.972 --> 00:25.473
unlike ever before.

00:25.507 --> 00:26.674
This challenge might be

00:26.708 --> 00:29.677
the most daunting
in <i> Face Off</i> history.

00:29.711 --> 00:31.612
(Emily) This is the hardest
thing I will ever do.

00:31.647 --> 00:33.047
Oh, no.

00:33.081 --> 00:35.216
(Stephanie) Just kind of
get, like, a little frazzled

00:35.250 --> 00:36.217
and a little frustrated.

00:36.251 --> 00:37.218
Mm.

00:37.252 --> 00:38.819
Toohm!

00:38.854 --> 00:40.521
I am very happy with this.

00:40.555 --> 00:41.856
(McKenzie)
In the end,

00:41.890 --> 00:42.990
only one will win a VIP trip

00:43.025 --> 00:44.792
from Kryolan
Professional Make-Up

00:44.826 --> 00:47.295
to one of their 85
international locations,

00:47.329 --> 00:50.231
a brand new 2014 Fiat 500,

00:50.265 --> 00:52.400
and $100,000.

00:54.136 --> 00:55.770
This is <i> Face Off.</i>

01:36.511 --> 01:37.611
Good morning.

01:37.646 --> 01:38.746
- Hey.
- What's up?

01:38.780 --> 01:40.014
Big winner.

01:40.048 --> 01:41.115
What's up, loser?

01:41.149 --> 01:42.350
[giggles]

01:42.384 --> 01:43.484
Congrats, by the way.

01:43.518 --> 01:44.485
Thank you.

01:44.519 --> 01:45.786
Ben, how does it feel

01:45.821 --> 01:48.222
to be the last man standing
on Team Anthony?

01:48.256 --> 01:49.390
(Ben)
It sucks.

01:49.424 --> 01:50.858
I feel like we had
a pretty good team.

01:50.892 --> 01:52.860
(Ben) Since I'm the only
one left on Team Anthony,

01:52.894 --> 01:54.228
there's a lot of pressure,

01:54.262 --> 01:56.697
so I got to put my best foot
forward even more so

01:56.732 --> 01:58.766
because, being that
he's such a good coach,

01:58.800 --> 02:00.534
I really don't want
to let him down.

02:09.811 --> 02:11.746
[horn honking]

02:11.780 --> 02:14.482
(Stephanie) We're in downtown
LA walking down the street.

02:14.516 --> 02:16.183
I'm not familiar with LA,

02:16.218 --> 02:17.852
so I have no idea
where we're going

02:17.886 --> 02:19.286
or what we're gonna be doing.

02:22.557 --> 02:25.226
We finally go
into this beautiful building,

02:25.260 --> 02:27.762
but it's got this
haunted old feel to it.

02:27.796 --> 02:29.363
I'm thinking lots of cool stuff

02:29.398 --> 02:31.399
probably happened here.

02:31.433 --> 02:32.500
Hey, guys.

02:32.534 --> 02:33.667
(all)
Hey.

02:33.702 --> 02:36.203
Welcome to
the Herald Examiner building.

02:36.238 --> 02:38.072
Once home to one of the nation's

02:38.106 --> 02:40.241
most highly-circulated
newspapers,

02:40.275 --> 02:42.009
it's now a popular
filming location

02:42.044 --> 02:44.011
for movies like
<i>The Usual Suspects,</i>

02:44.046 --> 02:47.048
<i>Collateral,</i>
and <i> Spider-Man 3.</i>

02:47.082 --> 02:49.283
This week's spotlight
challenge delves

02:49.317 --> 02:51.252
into a type of character
that has inspired

02:51.286 --> 02:54.722
generations of children
and adults alike...

02:54.756 --> 02:57.491
superheroes.

02:57.526 --> 02:58.492
[laughs]

02:58.527 --> 02:59.660
(Adam)
This is awesome for me

02:59.694 --> 03:01.662
because in my younger
artistic days,

03:01.696 --> 03:04.198
I used to attempt
to draw superheroes.

03:04.232 --> 03:05.766
So I'm really excited.

03:05.801 --> 03:07.134
[laughs]

03:07.169 --> 03:10.171
Now, for every Batman,
Spider-Man, and Superman,

03:10.205 --> 03:11.372
there's a Bruce Wayne,

03:11.406 --> 03:13.140
Peter Parker, and Clark Kent.

03:13.175 --> 03:15.643
These alter egos
are seemingly regular guys

03:15.677 --> 03:17.311
who transform into superheroes

03:17.345 --> 03:19.647
when danger is lurking.

03:19.681 --> 03:21.749
So for this spotlight challenge,

03:21.783 --> 03:24.985
you will transform
a seemingly ordinary person

03:25.020 --> 03:28.355
into an extraordinary
superhero character.

03:28.390 --> 03:30.591
(McKenzie) Of course,
there's just one thing.

03:30.625 --> 03:32.126
Always.

03:32.160 --> 03:34.028
Simply making
a superhero character

03:34.062 --> 03:37.098
is way too straightforward.

03:37.132 --> 03:40.234
This challenge might actually
be the most daunting

03:40.268 --> 03:41.635
in <i> Face Off</i> history.

03:41.670 --> 03:43.037
Ooh.

03:43.071 --> 03:45.005
What more could we do?
What is it?

03:45.040 --> 03:48.275
Because you are the alter egos
this week,

03:48.310 --> 03:50.344
and you'll be transforming
yourselves

03:50.378 --> 03:52.012
into superheroes.

03:52.047 --> 03:53.881
Oh, my goodness.

03:53.915 --> 03:55.182
[groans]

03:55.217 --> 03:56.884
This is gonna be
the hardest challenge

03:56.918 --> 03:58.419
and the hardest thing
I will ever do.

03:58.453 --> 04:00.054
Oh, my God.

04:00.088 --> 04:02.990
[laughter and applause]

04:03.024 --> 04:05.726
Okay, is this excitement
across the board?

04:05.760 --> 04:06.727
Yeah?

04:06.761 --> 04:08.362
Yes.

04:08.396 --> 04:10.064
(McKenzie)
Now I know it's very difficult

04:10.098 --> 04:11.732
to apply make-up
to yourselves,

04:11.766 --> 04:13.667
so you will have
make-up assistants

04:13.702 --> 04:15.769
on application day
to help you apply

04:15.804 --> 04:16.870
your prosthetics.

04:16.904 --> 04:17.904
Nice.

04:17.939 --> 04:19.673
All right, guys,
go ahead and get started

04:19.708 --> 04:20.774
on your designs.

04:20.809 --> 04:22.209
I can't wait
to see you guys onstage.

04:22.244 --> 04:23.711
Bye.

04:27.816 --> 04:30.484
(Logan) We're going to be
applying makeup to ourselves.

04:30.519 --> 04:32.052
No big deal.

04:32.087 --> 04:34.288
No big deal at all.

04:34.322 --> 04:36.524
My character has many elements

04:36.558 --> 04:37.958
of my life incorporated into it,

04:37.993 --> 04:41.162
including a fascination
for dragons

04:41.196 --> 04:42.963
and vigilante justice.

04:42.998 --> 04:44.532
I'm envisioning a new character

04:44.566 --> 04:45.833
in an older world.

04:45.867 --> 04:47.234
I've named him Slayer.

04:47.269 --> 04:48.869
This is a dragon-human hybrid.

04:48.904 --> 04:50.304
He's an immortal assassin,

04:50.338 --> 04:52.439
and he protects people
from corruption.

04:57.145 --> 04:58.546
I'm very excited

04:58.580 --> 05:00.948
and I'm not excited
at the same time.

05:00.982 --> 05:03.617
I'm very introverted, and...

05:03.652 --> 05:05.586
nature was always my outlet.

05:05.620 --> 05:07.087
So for my alter ego,

05:07.122 --> 05:09.089
I want to pull inspiration
from nature.

05:09.124 --> 05:12.693
I want to do a mother
nature-inspired superhero,

05:12.727 --> 05:13.861
who is a healer.

05:13.895 --> 05:15.863
This is gonna be

05:15.897 --> 05:17.298
a cool makeup.

05:20.335 --> 05:21.802
I have nothing solid yet.

05:21.836 --> 05:24.538
I'm just throwing shapes
around and poses.

05:24.573 --> 05:25.806
I'm drawing a blank.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.841
What would I look like
if I was a superhero.

05:27.876 --> 05:29.810
Superheroes
and super villains are cool,

05:29.844 --> 05:32.179
but I don't know what
I'm gonna do for myself.

05:37.586 --> 05:40.454
(Darla) Growing up, I
was very quiet and shy

05:40.488 --> 05:42.022
and kind of introverted.

05:42.057 --> 05:44.892
So I start thinking
of ways that I can take

05:44.926 --> 05:47.027
those aspects of me

05:47.062 --> 05:49.129
and create the exact opposite.

05:49.164 --> 05:51.565
I want to do more
of a guardian angel

05:51.600 --> 05:53.033
type superhero.

05:53.068 --> 05:54.935
She's elegant and beautiful.

05:54.970 --> 05:57.705
And I want a very
powerful silhouette.

05:57.739 --> 05:59.106
So I'm excited to get back
to the lab

05:59.140 --> 06:00.708
and start working on this.

06:12.787 --> 06:14.088
(Ben) We get back to the lab,

06:14.122 --> 06:16.190
and we have five hours
on the clock to work today.

06:16.224 --> 06:18.158
Can we see our ugly mugs?

06:25.867 --> 06:28.636
(Ben) To have a live cast
of myself is really weird.

06:28.670 --> 06:30.371
I've got one at the house,

06:30.405 --> 06:32.706
but for some reason, this one
looks like I'm a lot fatter,

06:32.741 --> 06:34.608
which is un-superhero-ish.

06:34.643 --> 06:36.910
But that's okay.
I'll go with it.

06:41.983 --> 06:43.517
Hey, guys!

06:43.551 --> 06:44.818
Hello!

06:44.853 --> 06:46.820
We got a birth... a
birthday in the house, right?

06:46.855 --> 06:48.255
So everybody get over here.

06:48.290 --> 06:50.724
Aww, thanks, guys.

06:50.759 --> 06:52.026
Thank you.

06:52.060 --> 06:53.527
How many people can say

06:53.561 --> 06:55.896
that they had their birthday
on <i> Face Off?</i>

06:55.930 --> 06:59.300
I can.

06:59.334 --> 07:01.101
This being my first birthday
away from home,

07:01.136 --> 07:02.303
it means a lot to me.

07:02.337 --> 07:03.804
Thank you, guys.

07:09.177 --> 07:12.613
I'm thinking, um,
he was a military experiment.

07:12.647 --> 07:13.814
Mm-hmm.

07:13.848 --> 07:15.115
Instead of doing a superhero,

07:15.150 --> 07:17.718
I'm actually going
for a villain.

07:17.752 --> 07:20.387
I spent five years in the Marine
Corps as a helicopter mechanic.

07:20.422 --> 07:24.558
So my concept is a super soldier
that was in a helicopter crash,

07:24.592 --> 07:26.593
and the government
put him back together

07:26.628 --> 07:28.662
to create this war machine.

07:28.697 --> 07:30.130
This is kind of
like the RoboCop,

07:30.165 --> 07:31.398
Terminator type line.

07:31.433 --> 07:32.433
Yeah.

07:32.467 --> 07:33.967
Ben is the last person
on my team.

07:34.002 --> 07:37.471
So it gives me the opportunity
to give all my attention to him.

07:37.505 --> 07:42.176
Maybe on the cowl,
sculpt the top of your cranium.

07:44.045 --> 07:46.480
He's also my last chance
to get to the finale.

07:46.514 --> 07:48.549
And I hope I can get him there.

07:49.718 --> 07:51.485
He's kind of an anti-hero.

07:51.519 --> 07:54.722
He's constantly fighting
the urge to do evil things.

07:54.756 --> 07:55.923
Yes.

07:55.957 --> 07:58.592
His name is Reckoning,
and he is an anti-hero

07:58.626 --> 08:00.694
who is a human that has made
a deal with the devil

08:00.729 --> 08:02.129
to take up his job.

08:02.163 --> 08:03.831
And he wants to use his powers
for good,

08:03.865 --> 08:05.699
but he's slowly
becoming a villain.

08:05.734 --> 08:08.602
Instead of doing
the traditional, two-horn devil,

08:08.636 --> 08:10.938
I decided to go
with almost like a crown shape.

08:10.972 --> 08:12.473
So I'm really happy and excited

08:12.507 --> 08:14.007
to see
how this is gonna turn out.

08:19.347 --> 08:22.750
My hero,
he fights giant monsters, right?

08:22.784 --> 08:24.451
But he has
no fucking experience.

08:24.486 --> 08:26.086
He doesn't know what he's doing,

08:26.121 --> 08:29.056
so he's just destroying cities
as he's trying to help people.

08:29.090 --> 08:30.758
I want my superhero to be funny.

08:30.792 --> 08:33.861
So he's a bumbling superhero
of Japan

08:33.895 --> 08:35.895
who created these gloves.

08:35.929 --> 08:37.898
But the gloves work in reverse

08:37.932 --> 08:40.000
and actually amplify the person
wearing the gloves.

08:40.034 --> 08:42.803
So he's able to grow
to immense sizes.

08:42.837 --> 08:44.471
He tries to help people,

08:44.506 --> 08:47.941
but he's just ruining the city
and millions of people's lives

08:47.976 --> 08:49.209
at the same time.

08:49.244 --> 08:51.979
And much like my life,
he is a fish out of water.

08:56.851 --> 08:58.318
My mom's a wigmaker.

08:58.353 --> 09:00.387
And she's showed me a lot
of the stuff that I know now.

09:00.422 --> 09:02.489
So I'm gonna make sure
that I incorporate a wig

09:02.524 --> 09:05.392
and make it the biggest wig
I have ever made,

09:05.427 --> 09:07.027
because my mom is my superhero.

09:07.061 --> 09:09.129
So the wig's for her.

09:09.164 --> 09:10.631
And I start pulling
the hair back

09:10.665 --> 09:13.534
and just rolling it so it
can get a more simple shape.

09:13.568 --> 09:17.438
And then I use cheesecloth
and wrap it so I have something

09:17.472 --> 09:19.706
to give the moss on.

09:19.741 --> 09:22.075
Then I spray it black
and then start gluing moss.

09:22.110 --> 09:24.778
It's huge.
And I love it.

09:29.484 --> 09:34.021
What is the idea
behind the whole character?

09:34.055 --> 09:35.456
Um, mostly taking, like,

09:35.490 --> 09:37.257
a post-apocalyptic kind
of world.

09:37.292 --> 09:38.659
I finally have a concept.

09:38.693 --> 09:40.527
And it's a sort of anti-hero.

09:40.562 --> 09:41.628
Like, a part demon.

09:41.663 --> 09:42.863
She protects humans.

09:42.897 --> 09:45.532
And I'm planning
on doing it black and white

09:45.567 --> 09:47.568
like she jumped
out of the comic book.

09:47.602 --> 09:49.169
I work at haunted houses.

09:49.204 --> 09:50.604
I scare people for a living.

09:50.638 --> 09:53.974
So her superpower is basically
scaring them to death.

09:54.008 --> 09:55.242
What does the face look like?

09:55.276 --> 09:56.610
I don't know yet.

09:56.644 --> 09:58.545
That's... that's
what I'm trying to figure out.

09:58.580 --> 09:59.780
- All righty.
- Um.

09:59.814 --> 10:01.281
And I'm having trouble, like,

10:01.316 --> 10:03.417
nailing down exactly what I
want the face to look like.

10:03.451 --> 10:04.718
And I just kind of get, like,

10:04.752 --> 10:06.420
a little frazzled
and a little frustrated.

10:06.454 --> 10:07.955
Hmm.

10:07.989 --> 10:10.390
(Laura) Stephanie's losing a lot
of time by not moving ahead.

10:10.425 --> 10:12.926
She needs to come up
with something very fast.

10:13.962 --> 10:15.462
It's halfway through the day,

10:15.497 --> 10:18.165
and I still haven't
started sculpting.

10:18.199 --> 10:20.100
I really want to do well
on this challenge,

10:20.134 --> 10:23.337
but I can't even think
of something to make.

10:23.371 --> 10:24.638
I'm totally lost.

10:29.624 --> 10:31.659
It looks like
a comic book character.

10:31.693 --> 10:32.993
Yeah.

10:33.028 --> 10:34.962
You just need to figure out
the perfect face.

10:34.996 --> 10:36.530
It's Day 1
of our Superhero Challenge.

10:36.564 --> 10:37.931
And I finally have a concept,

10:37.966 --> 10:39.967
but I'm having trouble
figuring out the face.

10:40.001 --> 10:42.936
So maybe
a smaller, subtler piece.

10:42.971 --> 10:45.339
That's what I was... I was
thinking of just doing a brow.

10:45.373 --> 10:46.640
(Laura) Yeah. A brow's great.

10:46.675 --> 10:48.976
Just make sure
your makeup looks flawless.

10:49.010 --> 10:49.977
Yeah.

10:50.011 --> 10:51.145
(Stephanie)
Laura's right.

10:51.179 --> 10:52.379
No matter what I do,

10:52.414 --> 10:54.114
I need to make sure
my makeup looks perfect.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.490
I'm going to do a dome shell,

11:03.525 --> 11:04.792
which is kind of like a helmet.

11:04.826 --> 11:06.093
In the Marine Corps,

11:06.127 --> 11:08.562
I did hydraulic sheet metal
fiberglass work.

11:08.596 --> 11:11.899
So this is really an opportunity
to show some of my skills.

11:11.933 --> 11:14.668
To make this helmet,
I sculpted out in wet clay

11:14.703 --> 11:16.470
and then take it over
at the black floor machine.

11:16.504 --> 11:17.571
That's cool.

11:17.605 --> 11:18.706
And then I can go ahead

11:18.740 --> 11:20.307
and start sculpting the cowl
around this

11:20.342 --> 11:22.042
to make sure it fits.

11:23.311 --> 11:25.212
(Emily) We have mirrors
set up at our stations,

11:25.246 --> 11:27.881
so I want to do a test makeup
because we are our models.

11:27.916 --> 11:29.850
So might as well test it out.

11:29.884 --> 11:34.121
I'm using Kryolan aqua colors,
lavenders, and greens.

11:34.155 --> 11:37.057
And I hate it.

11:37.092 --> 11:39.860
So I go for my second option,
which is more natural tones.

11:39.894 --> 11:41.729
I use a flesh-tone color,

11:41.763 --> 11:43.564
and I like that one.

11:43.598 --> 11:45.099
It goes with the natural theme.

11:45.133 --> 11:48.168
And I'm so happy
I decided to do this now.

11:53.975 --> 11:57.811
One of the most iconic parts
of a superhero

11:57.846 --> 11:59.413
is how their mask is shaped.

11:59.447 --> 12:00.814
So I'm just going

12:00.849 --> 12:02.783
for one that looks
like maybe a dragon would wear.

12:02.817 --> 12:04.151
The biggest thing with scales...

12:04.185 --> 12:05.753
you want them to read
from far away,

12:05.787 --> 12:07.621
even if they're subtle scales.

12:07.655 --> 12:09.022
The objective is to subtly

12:09.057 --> 12:11.392
suggest that he comes
from a world with dragons,

12:11.426 --> 12:13.093
but he's still a human.

12:13.128 --> 12:15.429
So I'm putting in scales,
but not too many scales.

12:15.463 --> 12:18.432
There's a lot of freedom
with this particular design.

12:18.466 --> 12:20.334
Because dragons didn't exist.

12:25.707 --> 12:26.840
[sighs]

12:26.875 --> 12:28.342
(Stephanie)
I'm throwing clay down.

12:28.376 --> 12:29.610
I'm pushing it around.

12:29.644 --> 12:30.944
I'm trying
to get a subtle shape.

12:30.979 --> 12:32.646
I don't want
to do a superhero mask.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.582
I'm going for a more organic,
demonic look.

12:35.617 --> 12:39.086
I named her Doll Face because I
want her to be a pretty demon.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.021
(Laura) Did you figure
out your concept?

12:41.055 --> 12:44.258
Yeah. Just worrying about
not doing enough on the face.

12:44.292 --> 12:46.126
(Laura)
You just do an immaculate job.

12:46.161 --> 12:47.494
Yeah.

12:47.529 --> 12:50.130
Okay, just...
it's got to be perfect.

12:50.165 --> 12:51.532
30 minutes, everybody.

13:00.408 --> 13:01.575
That's time, everybody.

13:01.609 --> 13:04.645
Okay, good enough.

13:04.679 --> 13:05.946
[sighs]

13:05.980 --> 13:07.314
(Stephanie)
By the end of Day 1,

13:07.348 --> 13:08.749
I have enough clay

13:08.783 --> 13:12.219
blocked out where I know
what I'm doing for Day 2.

13:12.253 --> 13:14.154
I just got to take care
of my time management

13:14.189 --> 13:16.557
better and finish it.

13:22.897 --> 13:24.965
(Darla) It's Day 2 of the
Superhero Challenge,

13:24.999 --> 13:26.633
and we have 9 1/2 hours
in the lab.

13:26.667 --> 13:29.002
And I have quite a bit
to get done today.

13:29.036 --> 13:31.371
Should I do some filigree work
on the helmet

13:31.405 --> 13:34.074
or should I just do that on,
like, the portions...

13:34.108 --> 13:35.142
Figure out the face first.

13:35.176 --> 13:36.510
Okay.

13:36.544 --> 13:38.879
The most important thing
is getting the face sculpt done.

13:38.913 --> 13:40.380
And as I'm sculpting,

13:40.414 --> 13:43.150
I start looking at the pictures
I took at the Herald building.

13:43.184 --> 13:45.318
And I realize I can actually

13:45.353 --> 13:48.889
trace some of the filigree
pattern from those pictures

13:48.923 --> 13:51.458
and transfer it onto my sculpt.

13:51.492 --> 13:55.595
So once I trace the filigree,
I press it against my sculpture,

13:55.630 --> 13:59.432
and it transfers the lead
of the pencil onto to the clay.

13:59.467 --> 14:01.468
So now I have an outline
to follow

14:01.502 --> 14:04.271
as I'm placing the filigree.

14:07.475 --> 14:08.608
(Laura)
That's cool.

14:08.643 --> 14:10.377
(Emily) I'm feeling
good about my sculpt,

14:10.411 --> 14:12.846
so I go ahead
and start molding my face.

14:14.515 --> 14:16.216
I finished the mold
really quick.

14:16.250 --> 14:17.984
But I cannot use foam latex

14:18.019 --> 14:19.486
because I'm allergic to it.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.555
So I run in gelatin.

14:21.589 --> 14:24.991
I let it sit to set up, and then
I'll come back later on.

14:29.430 --> 14:31.998
(Julian) Yesterday I blocked
out most of the cowl.

14:32.033 --> 14:33.533
I still have to complete it,

14:33.568 --> 14:36.203
and I need to get started
and complete the face.

14:36.237 --> 14:37.571
(Laura)
Do you ever speed sculpt?

14:37.605 --> 14:38.939
Not really.

14:38.973 --> 14:40.974
Laura's concerned
about my time management.

14:41.008 --> 14:41.975
Stand up.

14:42.009 --> 14:43.310
So she gives me some tips

14:43.344 --> 14:45.011
on how to do speed sculpting.

14:45.046 --> 14:47.447
I like using my fingers
and raking the whole thing.

14:47.481 --> 14:50.750
(Julian) Laura teaches me how to
get the forms in a faster pace.

14:52.253 --> 14:53.920
There.
See how quick that was?

14:53.955 --> 14:55.922
He does like to take his time,
which is a good thing,

14:55.957 --> 14:57.224
but on this competition,

14:57.258 --> 14:59.059
you can't afford
to take too much time.

14:59.093 --> 15:00.360
I got to speed it up.

15:04.098 --> 15:07.133
I want him to look scary
and be disgusting.

15:07.168 --> 15:08.735
I want to show
the skeletal structure

15:08.769 --> 15:10.136
underneath the respirator

15:10.171 --> 15:11.738
because I think

15:11.772 --> 15:13.940
that will really bring out
the villain aspect of things.

15:13.975 --> 15:16.543
And when I open up
that respirator, it will give me

15:16.577 --> 15:20.380
that little creepy factor
that really just sells nasty.

15:24.285 --> 15:27.187
I've been thinking
about making wings for this guy.

15:27.221 --> 15:28.388
Wings?

15:28.422 --> 15:29.823
(Logan)
I'm going to create

15:29.857 --> 15:32.125
some real badass wings
sticking up out of his back.

15:32.159 --> 15:33.927
I've had
this decade-long pursuit

15:33.961 --> 15:35.595
of becoming a military pilot.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.697
I like flight,
and I think it's a cool element

15:37.732 --> 15:39.165
to add to it.

15:39.200 --> 15:42.235
And then I pick out some foam
and some steel bar.

15:42.270 --> 15:44.638
And I run the bar
through the two pieces of foam.

15:44.672 --> 15:45.872
I bend it to the shape I want.

15:45.907 --> 15:47.207
What do you think
of that profile?

15:47.241 --> 15:49.109
And then I gaff tape
it together.

15:49.143 --> 15:50.510
100 miles an hour today.

15:50.544 --> 15:52.245
I put two layers
of cheesecloth on.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.613
One on one side,
one on the other,

15:53.648 --> 15:55.015
and latex them together.

15:55.049 --> 15:59.219
It gives an effect of skin
as opposed to raw materials.

15:59.253 --> 16:02.489
Once I get latex on there, they
start to look like dragon wings.

16:02.523 --> 16:03.857
[growling]

16:03.891 --> 16:05.759
Dude, that looks awesome.

16:05.793 --> 16:06.793
[chuckles]

16:19.340 --> 16:21.508
Shit.

16:21.542 --> 16:23.343
I go to open my face and...

16:23.377 --> 16:24.711
Shit.

16:24.745 --> 16:26.479
And I can feel the tackiness
of the gelatin

16:26.514 --> 16:27.681
that's on the side of the mold,

16:27.715 --> 16:28.715
and it's not setting.

16:28.749 --> 16:30.450
Oh, no.

16:30.484 --> 16:33.186
I pop it out. Then the edges
are just atrocious.

16:33.220 --> 16:34.721
I can't use it.

16:34.755 --> 16:37.090
I'm really nervous right now
because I don't have a face

16:37.124 --> 16:39.292
for my makeup
and I don't know what to do.

16:39.327 --> 16:40.760
This is not good.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.673
Oh, no.

16:46.707 --> 16:48.975
(Emily) It's Day 2 of our Alter
Ego Superhero Challenge.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.677
And I'm really nervous right now

16:50.711 --> 16:52.612
because I don't have a face
for my makeup.

16:52.646 --> 16:54.113
The edges are just atrocious.

16:54.148 --> 16:55.782
But I'm not giving up.

16:55.816 --> 16:57.750
I just need to get it
out of the mold.

16:57.785 --> 16:59.586
So I'm powdering and peeling it.

16:59.620 --> 17:02.355
My only option
is to run it in silicon.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.958
But I don't really know
how to use it.

17:04.992 --> 17:07.193
I'm not very comfortable
with it.

17:07.228 --> 17:08.361
We'll see.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.494
(Laura)
How did it turn out?

17:09.530 --> 17:10.496
Not good.

17:10.531 --> 17:11.897
(Laura)
Oh.

17:11.932 --> 17:14.032
(Emily) But I got to get
this ready for silicone.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.436
[laughing]

17:17.471 --> 17:19.071
I love the size of it.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.839
The arm pieces
are important to my concept

17:20.874 --> 17:22.275
because they're the accidental

17:22.309 --> 17:24.410
reason my character
becomes a superhero.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.079
So I see these buckets

17:26.113 --> 17:28.513
and I think it would be kind of
funny to go really, really big

17:28.549 --> 17:31.651
with these almost non-functional
cannon arms.

17:31.685 --> 17:35.355
So I take these serving dishes
to use as a top for the bucket.

17:35.389 --> 17:37.790
And I'm attaching tubing.

17:38.926 --> 17:40.660
And then I vacuum form it.

17:40.694 --> 17:42.795
And then I cut out the bottoms
of the buckets

17:42.830 --> 17:43.930
so I can put them on my arms.

17:43.964 --> 17:45.164
They look cool.

17:45.199 --> 17:49.335
They need to be painted,
but they're 90% done.

17:49.370 --> 17:50.703
Toong!

17:52.206 --> 17:53.273
I'm gonna get out of here.

17:53.307 --> 17:54.274
All right.

17:54.308 --> 17:55.275
All right.
Good luck.

17:55.309 --> 17:56.276
- Cool, man.
- You got it.

17:56.310 --> 17:57.310
Make sure you know exactly

17:57.344 --> 17:58.745
where you're gonna
take this thing.

17:58.779 --> 17:59.746
Okay.

17:59.780 --> 18:00.880
Leaving Day 2,

18:00.914 --> 18:02.515
I think both Adam
and Logan are on track.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.818
But I only have two artists
left on my team.

18:05.853 --> 18:07.320
Bye, guys.
Have fun.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.588
(Rayce)
Losing one of them

18:08.622 --> 18:11.124
could really hurt my chance
of going to the finale.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.132
Along with the brow
that I'm doing,

18:19.166 --> 18:21.634
I'm gonna be making a mask
that she holds in her hand

18:21.669 --> 18:23.736
to help scare the other demons.

18:23.771 --> 18:26.906
I start sculpting
a really fierce demon face.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.742
I'm going with,
like, super-arched eyebrows,

18:29.777 --> 18:31.077
and, like, a pointy nose,

18:31.111 --> 18:32.412
and high cheekbones.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.080
It's not totally refined,

18:34.114 --> 18:36.582
but it looks good enough to be
a scary mask.

18:38.319 --> 18:40.486
That's time, everybody.

18:40.521 --> 18:42.922
I think everyone's
feeling a little bit nervous,

18:42.956 --> 18:45.224
but also pretty excited
about tomorrow.

18:45.259 --> 18:47.994
It's gonna be a stressful,
hectic day.

18:48.028 --> 18:50.697
But in the end, we get
to be onstage as superheroes,

18:50.731 --> 18:52.498
and that's a pretty cool thing.

19:01.175 --> 19:02.308
(Rayce)
Good luck, guys.

19:02.343 --> 19:03.676
(Laura)
Hey, the models are here.

19:03.711 --> 19:04.844
Holy shit.

19:04.878 --> 19:06.212
It's application day today,

19:06.247 --> 19:08.815
and we have four hours
in lab and one hour Last Looks.

19:08.849 --> 19:10.783
And we are all really nervous.

19:10.818 --> 19:12.218
Laura, look at the edges.

19:12.253 --> 19:13.653
(Laura) Good mornin'! I know.

19:13.687 --> 19:15.321
(Emily) I look at my
silicone appliance,

19:15.356 --> 19:18.157
and the edges are stunning.

19:18.192 --> 19:19.425
They're paper thin.

19:19.460 --> 19:21.194
This is just a weight
off my shoulder.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.328
I'm so happy.

19:22.363 --> 19:23.896
That looks really good.

19:24.766 --> 19:26.399
(Darla) It's a little
bit strange 'cause

19:26.434 --> 19:27.634
we're not waiting on the models.

19:27.668 --> 19:28.902
We are the models.

19:28.936 --> 19:31.404
Um, but we are gonna
be having assistance today.

19:31.439 --> 19:32.405
Hello. Logan.

19:32.440 --> 19:33.540
Nice to meet you.

19:33.574 --> 19:34.574
Good to meet you too.

19:34.609 --> 19:35.575
- Hi!
- Vance.

19:35.610 --> 19:36.777
Hi.

19:36.811 --> 19:38.111
- I'm Carey.
- Nice to meet you.

19:38.646 --> 19:40.747
I have applied makeup
to myself before.

19:40.781 --> 19:42.348
But it's not easy.

19:42.383 --> 19:43.750
So it's really important

19:43.784 --> 19:46.486
for me to get
the cowl completely pre-painted

19:46.520 --> 19:48.121
before I even put it on.

19:54.328 --> 19:55.862
It's just this and a chin piece.

19:55.896 --> 19:57.030
Okay.

19:57.064 --> 19:58.498
And then the rest
of it is the suit,

19:58.532 --> 19:59.999
which I'm trying
to throw together.

20:00.034 --> 20:02.068
I know that I have
a lot more fabrication

20:02.102 --> 20:03.236
than makeup application.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.470
So the first thing I do

20:04.505 --> 20:06.372
is pull the rest
of the costume together.

20:06.407 --> 20:09.208
I want to make all
that look as good as it can be.

20:09.243 --> 20:11.244
So I start to do
some dry brushing.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.379
Then I just
dress the entire costume.

20:13.414 --> 20:14.847
I just hope I've created
something

20:14.882 --> 20:17.383
different enough that the judges
will be pleased with it.

20:17.418 --> 20:18.785
Hey, Logan, still look cheap?

20:18.819 --> 20:20.386
(Logan)
No, it looks awesome.

20:23.457 --> 20:26.326
I am not a fan of putting
prosthetics on my face.

20:26.360 --> 20:27.560
So that's why I was like,

20:27.594 --> 20:29.028
"I want to make a character

20:29.063 --> 20:31.064
where I don't have
to put as much stuff on."

20:31.098 --> 20:32.765
All I got to do
is put a brow piece on

20:32.800 --> 20:35.935
and basically paint
everything in black and white.

20:35.969 --> 20:39.806
I start from the nose
and then work my way out.

20:39.840 --> 20:41.941
I just got to make sure that it
all lines up and it's not,

20:41.975 --> 20:43.509
like, totally crooked.

20:43.544 --> 20:45.545
Now I have to start
painting like crazy.

20:54.455 --> 20:56.723
So it's time
for me to apply a bald cap.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.624
Just kidding.
[laughs]

20:58.659 --> 21:01.394
What I have to do now
is get these pieces painted

21:01.428 --> 21:03.496
and get 'em ready
so that I can apply 'em.

21:03.530 --> 21:06.432
If you're able to start
pre-painting the packs on this.

21:06.467 --> 21:08.000
It's time to take the cowl

21:08.035 --> 21:11.204
and really get that black,
leathery, metal work on it.

21:11.238 --> 21:13.606
And it's looking great.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.508
So once I get
these things applied,

21:15.542 --> 21:17.343
I can just
worry about the wardrobe,

21:17.378 --> 21:19.746
and I'll have an hour
left at Last Looks.

21:22.583 --> 21:24.150
Cold.

21:24.184 --> 21:25.585
Good painting's about layers,

21:25.619 --> 21:28.354
not obvious, bold strokes.

21:28.389 --> 21:29.455
[laughs]

21:29.490 --> 21:30.690
Especially subtleties.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.325
I'm finishing painting the face.

21:32.359 --> 21:33.693
And the color scheme today

21:33.727 --> 21:35.695
is going to be very flesh-toned
and green.

21:35.729 --> 21:37.530
It's a hybrid
of a dragon and a human,

21:37.564 --> 21:40.366
so I want to incorporate
predominant colors from both.

21:40.401 --> 21:41.367
See you later.

21:41.402 --> 21:42.602
Yeah, bye.

21:42.636 --> 21:44.837
The face goes on,
and from here on out,

21:44.872 --> 21:47.607
I'm gonna be Slayer,
the Defender of Dragons.

21:53.013 --> 21:56.883
Now, how do I go in
and make it more translucent?

21:56.917 --> 22:00.720
I probably would layer upon
layer of a very watered-down

22:00.754 --> 22:04.690
translucent alcohol-based colors
on top of your flesh-tone.

22:04.725 --> 22:07.393
I'm using alcohol colors
to make it more translucent

22:07.428 --> 22:11.264
so we can really get
that looking realistic.

22:11.298 --> 22:13.466
But I'm nervous about using
alcohol paints 'cause

22:13.500 --> 22:15.301
I've only used
them for injuries.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.969
I've done a lot
of things this challenge

22:17.004 --> 22:18.604
that I have not done before.

22:18.639 --> 22:20.973
I just hope it pays off
in the end.

22:21.008 --> 22:22.809
One hour, everybody.

22:24.578 --> 22:26.846
(Stephanie) I want to make sure
that I have a graphic look.

22:26.880 --> 22:28.714
That's why I'm going
for the whole

22:28.749 --> 22:29.982
black-and-white color scheme.

22:30.017 --> 22:32.685
But it's looking really muddy
and really gray.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.353
Um...

22:34.388 --> 22:37.356
I'm starting to look
like a blue, vampirey,

22:37.391 --> 22:39.025
weird... I don't know.

22:39.059 --> 22:41.594
I'm just not liking
how it's all coming together.

22:41.628 --> 22:43.596
And I'm trying
to do some flicking

22:43.630 --> 22:45.164
just to break it up.

22:45.199 --> 22:48.167
I'm looking totally different
than what I wanted.

22:48.202 --> 22:49.769
(Rayce)
15 minutes, everybody.

22:54.842 --> 22:56.008
(Laura)
All right, that's it.

22:56.043 --> 22:57.477
Time's up!

22:57.511 --> 22:59.979
I'm really worried
because I'm looking vampirey.

23:00.013 --> 23:01.948
I mean,
I only have one appliance.

23:01.982 --> 23:05.751
There's really nothing else
to distract away from that.

23:05.786 --> 23:08.020
Ugh. It's making me really,
really nervous.

23:13.672 --> 23:16.174
(Rayce) It's game time, baby.
It's game time.

23:16.208 --> 23:17.575
(Darla)
It's Last Looks,

23:17.610 --> 23:19.444
and we have one hour
to finish our superheroes.

23:19.878 --> 23:22.446
I'm really concerned
about finishing the face

23:22.481 --> 23:24.448
and not having enough time

23:24.483 --> 23:26.317
to finish this character
the way I want to.

23:26.351 --> 23:28.920
Wow, I am not good at
airbrushing with my left hand.

23:31.189 --> 23:32.657
Are you kidding?

23:32.691 --> 23:33.858
I really got to punch up

23:33.892 --> 23:35.493
some of the highlights
just to make sure

23:35.527 --> 23:37.428
that I have some sort
of, like, graphic look to me.

23:37.462 --> 23:40.598
But I could still end up
just looking really muddy.

23:42.467 --> 23:44.001
30 minutes.

23:44.036 --> 23:45.570
(Adam)
I can't even airbrush on myself.

23:45.604 --> 23:47.772
I still have some painting
to do and some shading.

23:47.806 --> 23:50.041
But I can't do it on myself.

23:50.075 --> 23:51.342
Do you need it around your eyes?

23:51.376 --> 23:52.743
- Yeah.
- I'll do it.

23:52.778 --> 23:54.579
(Adam) We're all competing
to win this thing,

23:54.613 --> 23:56.347
but everyone needs each other
at this point.

23:56.381 --> 23:57.848
Look up for me.

24:01.353 --> 24:02.753
(Logan)
I'm trying to do modeling,

24:02.788 --> 24:03.921
but I can't see.

24:03.956 --> 24:05.389
I know that I've missed
some spots.

24:05.424 --> 24:07.191
So I ask Adam
to hit it for 15 seconds.

24:07.225 --> 24:08.659
10 minutes, everybody.

24:12.631 --> 24:14.565
That looks awesome, Ben.

24:14.600 --> 24:16.233
Looking
at everyone else's character,

24:16.268 --> 24:18.369
I realize I am not a superhero.

24:18.403 --> 24:19.971
This is so stupid.

24:20.005 --> 24:21.405
There's not much I can do.

24:26.445 --> 24:27.944
All right, it's time.

24:27.945 --> 24:28.945
Fuck.

24:29.514 --> 24:31.248
I'm all right,
I'm all right, I'm all right.

24:31.283 --> 24:32.817
(Emily) I've never
been this nervous.

24:32.851 --> 24:35.019
I don't think
I look like a superhero.

24:35.053 --> 24:38.255
Gosh, I just
want this to be over.

24:41.126 --> 24:42.393
Good evening, judges.

24:42.427 --> 24:43.661
How are you doing tonight?

24:43.695 --> 24:44.895
- Great, thank you.
- Bitchin'.

24:44.930 --> 24:46.364
(McKenzie)
Excellent.

24:46.398 --> 24:48.733
And hello as well
to our champion coaches.

24:48.767 --> 24:49.734
How are you guys doing?

24:49.768 --> 24:50.768
Pretty good.

24:50.802 --> 24:52.136
Peachy with a side of keen.

24:52.170 --> 24:53.304
All right, well,

24:53.338 --> 24:55.006
tonight's gonna be a lot of fun,
obviously.

24:55.040 --> 24:56.240
This week the contestants'

24:56.274 --> 24:58.175
Spotlight Challenge
was to create a superhero

24:58.210 --> 24:59.644
using themselves

24:59.678 --> 25:01.679
as the alter ego and inspiration
for its design.

25:01.713 --> 25:03.648
And not only that,
they had to apply the makeup

25:03.682 --> 25:05.349
to themselves as well.

25:05.384 --> 25:06.784
And I think it's safe to say

25:06.818 --> 25:08.986
that this may be
the hardest challenge

25:09.021 --> 25:10.855
that we've ever done
on this show.

25:10.889 --> 25:12.156
For sure.

25:12.190 --> 25:12.770
All right, are you guys

25:12.851 --> 25:14.136
ready to see
what they've come up with?

25:14.199 --> 25:15.200
- Oh, yeah.
- Absolutely.

25:15.283 --> 25:17.160
- Can't wait.
- Okay, well, let's take a look.

25:19.198 --> 25:21.232
All right, let's really
see what these guys can do.

25:46.392 --> 25:48.993
(Logan) This is a very different
experience coming out onstage.

25:49.027 --> 25:50.928
We have to act,
which is a blast.

25:50.963 --> 25:52.397
I'm lovin' doing this.

26:16.522 --> 26:19.023
(Julian) The makeup alone may
not read as a superhero,

26:19.057 --> 26:20.591
but the character as a whole,

26:20.626 --> 26:22.794
I think that reads
as superhero enough.

26:22.828 --> 26:24.629
This is just a lot of fun.

26:45.284 --> 26:46.984
(Stephanie)
I knew it was gonna be hard,

26:47.019 --> 26:49.353
but I'm just seeing Glenn
doing his eyebrow.

26:49.388 --> 26:52.089
He is just so stone-faced
while I'm posing, and,

26:52.124 --> 26:53.524
like, "Am I doing this right?"

26:53.559 --> 26:55.159
Yeah, it's nerve-racking.

27:16.548 --> 27:18.249
(Darla) I have a
love-hate relationship

27:18.283 --> 27:20.718
with this makeup 'cause
I really love the cowl,

27:20.752 --> 27:23.788
but I'm not happy
with how the face turned out.

27:49.548 --> 27:51.449
(Ben)
I've got this gun in my hands.

27:51.483 --> 27:53.017
I've got these creepy eyes,

27:53.051 --> 27:54.719
and I've got this skeleton face.

27:54.753 --> 27:57.455
I definitely feel badass
right now.

27:58.724 --> 28:00.858
[laughter]

28:21.146 --> 28:22.680
(Emily)
So I'm onstage.

28:22.714 --> 28:25.550
I'm like, "Okay,
I guess I'm a superhero."

28:25.584 --> 28:27.885
I've never been this nervous
in my life.

28:48.273 --> 28:50.908
(Adam) I make sure to
put my cheesy grin on.

28:50.942 --> 28:52.643
And I'm in heaven right now.

28:58.516 --> 29:00.618
This week
was such a tough challenge,

29:00.652 --> 29:02.987
but you guys did a great job.

29:03.021 --> 29:05.122
[cheers and applause]

29:05.156 --> 29:07.925
Okay, before the judges
come to take a closer look,

29:07.959 --> 29:11.395
I do have another huge surprise
for you.

29:11.429 --> 29:12.696
Oh, no.

29:12.731 --> 29:14.365
I wanted to have you
all out here together

29:14.399 --> 29:16.901
before I introduce tonight's
very special guest judge.

29:16.935 --> 29:20.037
He's a comic book industry
legend who has worked

29:20.071 --> 29:22.806
on some of its most
popular and iconic titles

29:22.841 --> 29:25.542
like Spider-Man
and The Incredible Hulk.

29:25.577 --> 29:28.646
He's also one of the founders
of Image Comics and created one

29:28.680 --> 29:33.183
of the most popular comic book
franchises of all time, Spawn.

29:33.218 --> 29:34.551
[chuckling]

29:34.586 --> 29:38.022
Please give a big welcome
to Todd McFarlane.

29:38.056 --> 29:39.490
Oh, man.

29:39.524 --> 29:40.891
Hey, McKenzie,
how are you today?

29:40.926 --> 29:42.693
Good.
Great to have you here.

29:42.727 --> 29:44.929
Oh, my God.
That's so awesome.

29:44.963 --> 29:47.097
(Adam) Todd McFarlane was
just a huge influence on me

29:47.132 --> 29:48.966
when I started drawing as a kid.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.801
It's really cool
to have him here.

29:52.304 --> 29:53.437
Now, there is no one

29:53.471 --> 29:56.674
more qualified than you
to be judging superheroes.

29:56.708 --> 29:58.008
And I know that you
were watching backstage.

29:58.043 --> 29:59.310
Yes.

29:59.344 --> 30:00.778
So are you ready to take
a closer look at these guys?

30:00.812 --> 30:02.279
Yes, we will.

30:02.314 --> 30:05.015
All right, judges,
you ready to do this?

30:05.050 --> 30:07.584
(Logan) This is a very difference
experience for closer looks.

30:07.619 --> 30:09.620
I don't know if I'm supposed
to act in character

30:09.654 --> 30:11.956
or if I'm supposed
to freeze and be just a statue.

30:11.990 --> 30:12.957
I don't know.

30:12.991 --> 30:13.991
Hi, Logan.

30:14.025 --> 30:15.826
Hi.

30:15.860 --> 30:17.328
You sure got a lot
done this week.

30:17.362 --> 30:20.097
(Glenn) Could you turn sideways
so we can see your wings?

30:20.131 --> 30:21.665
These layers really help sell

30:21.700 --> 30:23.934
these instead
of just being flat.

30:23.969 --> 30:25.569
(Todd)
Can we get a grit right here?

30:25.603 --> 30:27.171
Yeah, there we go.

30:27.205 --> 30:28.505
Give us a couple of expressions.

30:29.808 --> 30:31.909
Yeah.

30:31.943 --> 30:34.244
You look like you're kind
of diggin' this.

30:34.279 --> 30:37.348
[laughter]

30:37.382 --> 30:39.116
(Glenn) Did you have
fun this week, Julian?

30:39.150 --> 30:40.317
Oh, yeah.

30:40.352 --> 30:42.119
(Neville) Can you give
us a furrowed brow?

30:42.153 --> 30:43.420
(Glenn)
That's some nice edges

30:43.455 --> 30:45.322
for something
that you put on yourself.

30:46.458 --> 30:47.792
I think the ears

30:47.826 --> 30:49.760
could have been sculpted
much better though.

30:49.795 --> 30:50.795
I'm sorry.

30:50.829 --> 30:52.296
(Glenn)
Let's see this mask.

30:52.331 --> 30:53.865
Were you intending
on holding this up?

30:53.899 --> 30:54.866
Is this your mask?

30:54.900 --> 30:56.033
Yeah.

30:56.068 --> 30:57.401
(Glenn) Okay. So let's see this.

30:57.436 --> 30:58.803
It wouldn't actually
fit my face.

30:58.837 --> 31:00.371
Cool. Thank you.

31:00.405 --> 31:01.405
Hi, Darla.

31:01.440 --> 31:02.507
Hello.

31:02.541 --> 31:04.075
(Darla)
I'm concerned about the paint.

31:04.109 --> 31:05.142
It's starting to crack.

31:05.177 --> 31:06.944
Let's see a look of victory.

31:06.979 --> 31:11.649
(Darla) I'm trying to make as little
facial expression as possible.

31:11.683 --> 31:13.251
Now give us a look of poison.

31:13.285 --> 31:14.886
I could be in trouble.

31:19.591 --> 31:21.959
Tell us who made
your favorite superhero tonight

31:21.993 --> 31:24.194
on Twitter using #FaceOff

31:27.107 --> 31:29.508
(Darla) I'm worried that if I
move around too much, the paint

31:29.542 --> 31:30.776
is gonna start to crack.

31:30.810 --> 31:32.711
Now give us a look of poison.

31:32.745 --> 31:34.113
(Todd)
There you go.

31:34.147 --> 31:36.448
(Darla) I just hope that
the rest of the makeup

31:36.483 --> 31:38.016
is enough to keep me safe.

31:39.486 --> 31:43.922
(Glenn) All right, Ben,
give us that big reveal.

31:43.957 --> 31:47.092
(Glenn) So this is all stuff
that you built, right?

31:47.127 --> 31:48.293
How about some expressions?

31:49.295 --> 31:50.762
[chuckles]

31:57.604 --> 32:00.072
You love that big hair,
don't you, girl?

32:00.106 --> 32:02.641
All right, you got a couple
of looks for us, then?

32:02.675 --> 32:04.810
[laughter]

32:04.844 --> 32:06.612
(Emily)
It's awkward.

32:06.646 --> 32:08.847
I completely blank out.

32:08.882 --> 32:10.749
I'm digging
my hole deeper and deeper.

32:10.783 --> 32:12.584
Just made the willow weep,
I think.

32:12.619 --> 32:13.652
[laughter]

32:13.686 --> 32:14.920
Good evening.

32:14.954 --> 32:16.655
You've just been waitin'
to use that hairdo

32:16.689 --> 32:17.723
of yours, haven't you?

32:17.757 --> 32:19.224
(Adam)
Maybe.

32:19.259 --> 32:21.360
Let's see what these things are.

32:21.394 --> 32:22.928
They're protonic plasma.

32:22.962 --> 32:24.096
It's all very complicated.

32:24.130 --> 32:25.364
You don't want to hear about it.

32:25.398 --> 32:26.865
[laughter]

32:26.900 --> 32:28.433
Thank you.

32:32.772 --> 32:35.040
Okay, the judges
have scored your creations,

32:35.074 --> 32:36.842
so let's find out
what they thought.

32:36.876 --> 32:38.143
Julian,

32:38.178 --> 32:39.945
Darla,

32:39.979 --> 32:41.480
Ben.

32:41.514 --> 32:43.749
Congratulations
because you are all safe

32:43.783 --> 32:46.018
and can head back
to the makeup room.

32:54.260 --> 32:56.061
Shit.

32:56.095 --> 32:59.665
The rest of you were the best
and the worst this week.

32:59.699 --> 33:01.700
And the judges would like
to speak with each of you

33:01.734 --> 33:03.468
to find out
more about your work.

33:03.503 --> 33:05.470
Logan, if you'd please step out.

33:10.911 --> 33:12.578
Logan, I can't wait
to hear the backstory,

33:12.612 --> 33:14.980
but all in your superhero voice,
please.

33:15.015 --> 33:16.782
My name is Slayer.

33:16.816 --> 33:19.084
[laughter]

33:20.620 --> 33:22.955
I hail from the time
dragons ruled,

33:22.989 --> 33:24.256
and I defended them.

33:24.291 --> 33:25.491
Now I defend people.

33:25.525 --> 33:27.326
That's my story.

33:27.360 --> 33:30.429
[laughter]

33:30.463 --> 33:31.897
I'm very impressed

33:31.932 --> 33:34.433
with your conceptual designs
and your technical work.

33:36.002 --> 33:38.003
It's not something
I've seen before.

33:38.038 --> 33:42.341
It encourages us to want to know
more about the backstory,

33:42.375 --> 33:44.643
and its origin
is incredibly impressive.

33:44.678 --> 33:46.011
Thank you very much.

33:46.046 --> 33:47.379
I love this color palette,

33:47.414 --> 33:49.248
and it really gives it a lot
of life.

33:49.282 --> 33:51.984
And I especially love
what you did with your wings.

33:52.018 --> 33:54.920
(Ve) It really takes your imagination
someplace, which is great.

33:54.955 --> 33:56.588
I am very happy with this.

33:58.258 --> 34:01.126
Sculpturally speaking,
you've nailed it with the face.

34:01.161 --> 34:03.595
You can see that you're able
to emote through it.

34:03.630 --> 34:07.399
Yet you've somehow baked
in that expression,

34:07.434 --> 34:09.802
and it's really
quite accomplished.

34:09.835 --> 34:11.036
Thank you.

34:11.071 --> 34:13.973
You've taken
what is traditional garb...

34:14.007 --> 34:15.040
You've got a mask,

34:15.074 --> 34:16.507
you've got a logo,

34:16.543 --> 34:19.645
but you put it into a frame now
that isn't so obvious.

34:19.679 --> 34:20.913
So I like the whole message

34:20.947 --> 34:22.481
that you're bringing across
right now.

34:22.514 --> 34:24.116
Thank you very much.

34:24.150 --> 34:25.384
Logan, please step back.

34:31.458 --> 34:33.525
Emily, you're up next.

34:38.831 --> 34:40.165
(Ve)
Well, forest babe,

34:40.199 --> 34:41.467
tell us all about yourself.

34:41.501 --> 34:43.569
So I am nature's daughter.

34:43.603 --> 34:45.170
So I heal animals,

34:45.205 --> 34:49.440
and I just help bring the good
out of people.

34:49.476 --> 34:51.810
(Ve) I got to say, I
love the paint job,

34:51.844 --> 34:55.347
but I'm a little tired
of the big hairdos.

34:55.382 --> 34:56.782
I don't know what to say, honey.

34:56.815 --> 34:59.651
I'm just very disappointed
that you repeated yourself.

34:59.686 --> 35:01.020
Okay, thank you.

35:01.054 --> 35:04.556
This is, for me, not
appropriate for this challenge.

35:04.591 --> 35:07.493
You look like a hedge
or a topiary.

35:07.527 --> 35:08.961
At this point
in the competition,

35:08.995 --> 35:10.963
without allowing
yourself to evolve,

35:10.997 --> 35:13.899
you're going to be doomed.

35:13.933 --> 35:15.734
Emily, thank you very much.

35:15.769 --> 35:17.336
Please step back.

35:23.810 --> 35:25.711
Adam, please step forward.

35:31.751 --> 35:33.419
Tell us about your superhero
character.

35:33.453 --> 35:35.320
I am the Crimson Wave.

35:35.355 --> 35:37.856
I stuck my arms in these things.
They didn't come off.

35:37.891 --> 35:41.026
And I decided to throw a mask
on, move to Japan,

35:41.061 --> 35:42.661
and save the city.

35:42.695 --> 35:46.098
[laughter]

35:46.132 --> 35:47.833
Makes a lot of sense
when he says it that way.

35:47.867 --> 35:49.168
Yeah.

35:49.202 --> 35:50.836
(Neville) You've really
done a great job

35:50.870 --> 35:53.605
at creating
an overall superhero character.

35:53.640 --> 35:57.643
It's good that this is comedic
because the proportions

35:57.677 --> 36:00.612
are so insane.

36:00.647 --> 36:02.748
If I was 10 years
old, 11 years old,

36:02.782 --> 36:03.916
I'd dig you to hell.

36:03.950 --> 36:05.117
Of all the people up there,

36:05.151 --> 36:06.718
you were the one
that was in character.

36:06.753 --> 36:09.955
And after doing comic books
for 25-plus years,

36:09.989 --> 36:11.523
I dig it.

36:11.558 --> 36:14.560
(Glenn) What really counted
is you made sure that you

36:14.594 --> 36:17.696
hit that one note this week
which was superhero.

36:17.730 --> 36:21.934
And so many pieces of
your design say that so clearly.

36:21.968 --> 36:23.535
And that's what I
love about the makeup.

36:23.570 --> 36:24.570
Thank you.

36:24.604 --> 36:26.472
Adam, you can step back.

36:29.742 --> 36:31.410
Hey.

36:31.444 --> 36:33.011
Good job.

36:33.046 --> 36:34.279
Thanks, Dad.

36:34.314 --> 36:36.148
All right,
let's talk to Stephanie.

36:42.322 --> 36:45.657
Talk to us about how you got
to what is

36:45.692 --> 36:46.925
in front of us right now.

36:46.960 --> 36:48.527
My character is Doll Face,

36:48.561 --> 36:51.830
and she is set
in a post-apocalyptic world.

36:51.865 --> 36:55.734
And she is trying to protect
all the remaining humans

36:55.768 --> 36:57.436
that are left on Earth.

36:57.470 --> 37:00.405
One of the things that I
would have liked to have seen

37:00.440 --> 37:02.074
is that when we asked you
to put the mask up,

37:02.108 --> 37:03.342
you said it didn't fit.

37:03.376 --> 37:06.512
And that's a bit
of a shame to me.

37:06.546 --> 37:08.714
'Cause it would have been kind
of cool if you actually

37:08.748 --> 37:11.216
had the reveal like Beauty
and the Beast, if you will.

37:11.251 --> 37:12.951
For sure.

37:12.986 --> 37:16.021
(Glenn) You have chances to explore
demons in other challenges.

37:16.055 --> 37:19.158
So if you would have
done that extraordinarily well,

37:19.192 --> 37:20.626
I could have gotten behind it.

37:20.660 --> 37:22.361
But the forms are just...

37:22.395 --> 37:24.396
they're too derivative.

37:24.430 --> 37:26.198
(Ve)
The appliance that you have on

37:26.232 --> 37:28.300
is very similar
to what I put on Kiefer.

37:28.334 --> 37:30.569
Did you ever see the movie
<i>The Lost Boys?</i>

37:30.603 --> 37:32.004
Oh, yeah.

37:32.038 --> 37:33.505
(Ve)
So it's a little bit repetitive

37:33.540 --> 37:35.007
and boring for me to see it.

37:35.041 --> 37:37.242
And not only that, I
think you did a really poor job

37:37.277 --> 37:38.443
painting yourself.

37:38.478 --> 37:42.014
You look like an old lady
with red eyes.

37:42.048 --> 37:43.015
Stephanie, thank you.

37:43.049 --> 37:44.416
If you'd please step back.

37:52.292 --> 37:53.625
Okay, thank you, guys.

37:53.660 --> 37:55.360
If you'd please head back
to the makeup room

37:55.395 --> 37:56.995
while the judges deliberate.

38:03.036 --> 38:06.004
All right, judges, let's start
with you favorite looks tonight.

38:06.039 --> 38:07.773
How about Logan's work?

38:07.807 --> 38:09.374
(Ve)
I love Logan's.

38:09.409 --> 38:12.177
It just looked like he stepped
right out of another century.

38:12.212 --> 38:14.546
(Todd) Yeah, if you can
take him 2,000 years back

38:14.581 --> 38:16.448
and 2,000 years in the future,

38:16.482 --> 38:18.917
I could still figure out the
story that would make him work.

38:18.952 --> 38:20.419
The detailing of the makeup

38:20.453 --> 38:22.955
in addition to everything
else was pretty incredible.

38:22.989 --> 38:24.556
All right,
let's move on to Adam.

38:24.591 --> 38:26.491
(Neville) Everything
about it was successful.

38:26.526 --> 38:28.560
He literalized it
by making it a comedian.

38:28.595 --> 38:31.863
And that's what makes it also
really good as a superhero.

38:31.898 --> 38:33.999
If I could make an action
figure out of any of you,

38:34.033 --> 38:35.634
he was the guy
that I'd want to bring home

38:35.668 --> 38:36.868
to my eight-year-old son.

38:36.903 --> 38:38.237
(Glenn)
He enjoyed it so much.

38:38.271 --> 38:40.439
I forgot it was Adam
under there.

38:40.473 --> 38:43.141
All right, let's move on
to the looks you like the least.

38:43.176 --> 38:44.943
Why don't we start with Emily?

38:44.978 --> 38:46.778
(Glenn) Marge Simpson
is Poison Ivy.

38:46.813 --> 38:50.882
That absolutely absurd hedge
of a hairdo.

38:50.917 --> 38:53.018
(Neville) There was nothing
that suggested that she

38:53.052 --> 38:56.255
had any strength
as a superhero, as a woman.

38:56.289 --> 38:58.523
(Todd) She was a little bit
shy about who she was.

38:58.558 --> 39:01.493
She was still uncomfortable
in her skin even with the power.

39:01.527 --> 39:03.695
Okay, let's move
on to Stephanie.

39:03.730 --> 39:04.997
(Ve)
The paint job sucked.

39:05.031 --> 39:06.732
That's what really ruined
this for me.

39:06.766 --> 39:08.734
'Cause she looks
like a, you know, zombie.

39:08.768 --> 39:10.535
(Glenn)
It was a brow shape

39:10.570 --> 39:14.239
that we've all seen a painful
amount of times at this point.

39:14.274 --> 39:17.676
(Neville) I don't think
it was a horrible makeup.

39:17.710 --> 39:20.646
It's just that there was nothing
there but gray.

39:20.680 --> 39:22.648
All right, judges,
have you made your decisions?

39:22.682 --> 39:23.849
We have.

39:23.883 --> 39:25.117
Let's bring them back out.

39:33.493 --> 39:35.894
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's top looks.

39:35.928 --> 39:40.065
Logan, your character
certainly has a superhero vibe,

39:40.099 --> 39:43.268
but what we really love is that
he also had a mysterious quality

39:43.303 --> 39:45.804
which made us want
to know more about him.

39:45.838 --> 39:49.041
And Adam, the comedic nature
of your superhero suits

39:49.075 --> 39:50.809
your personality perfectly.

39:50.843 --> 39:53.612
And your performance gave him
extra dimension in life.

39:53.646 --> 39:54.946
All right,

39:54.981 --> 39:56.848
so who is the winner
of tonight's challenge?

39:56.883 --> 39:58.550
The winner
of tonight's challenge is...

40:04.188 --> 40:05.488
All right,

40:05.523 --> 40:06.990
so who is the winner
of tonight's challenge?

40:07.024 --> 40:09.092
The winner of tonight's
challenge is...

40:11.929 --> 40:14.030
Logan.

40:14.065 --> 40:16.800
[cheers and applause]

40:16.834 --> 40:19.069
(Glenn) Your superhero
clicked in every level.

40:19.103 --> 40:21.371
And you did astounding
technical work,

40:21.405 --> 40:24.040
especially considering
you had to apply it on yourself.

40:24.075 --> 40:25.442
Great job tonight, man.

40:25.476 --> 40:26.443
Thank you very much.

40:26.477 --> 40:27.944
(Logan)
This is a cool moment.

40:27.979 --> 40:30.280
Of all the makeups that I've
done in the competition so far,

40:30.314 --> 40:31.781
I'm most proud of this one.

40:31.816 --> 40:34.017
This is win number three for me
and I'm stoked about it.

40:34.051 --> 40:35.418
Thank to my coach, Rayce.

40:35.453 --> 40:37.153
Thank you.

40:37.188 --> 40:39.756
All right, so Logan, you
and Adam along with the coaches

40:39.790 --> 40:41.591
can all head backstage.

40:50.134 --> 40:53.403
All right, guys, that means that
you are on the bottom this week,

40:53.437 --> 40:55.005
and one of you
will be going home.

40:55.039 --> 40:56.773
Please step forward.

41:04.081 --> 41:06.616
All right, Glenn, tell us
about tonight's bottom looks.

41:06.651 --> 41:09.185
Emily, the makeup part
of your character

41:09.220 --> 41:10.720
is actually quite beautiful,

41:10.755 --> 41:12.522
but there was
an overall disconnect

41:12.556 --> 41:15.659
with the superhero aspect
of the challenge for us.

41:15.693 --> 41:17.761
Stephanie, on another week,

41:17.795 --> 41:19.729
this demon-like character
could have worked.

41:19.764 --> 41:23.233
But we really didn't feel
like we see you in this makeup.

41:23.267 --> 41:25.602
So who is going home tonight?

41:25.636 --> 41:27.604
The person going home tonight
is...

41:31.042 --> 41:33.843
Stephanie.

41:33.878 --> 41:35.412
Yep.

41:35.446 --> 41:37.247
The paint work
was pretty weak, but moreover,

41:37.281 --> 41:39.883
we just didn't feel like you
were inspired by this challenge,

41:39.917 --> 41:42.018
which showed
in the finished product.

41:42.053 --> 41:43.019
(Glenn)
I'm sorry.

41:43.054 --> 41:44.320
You know what?

41:44.355 --> 41:45.855
I had a lot of fun
in this challenge.

41:45.890 --> 41:47.323
It might not have shown,
but I did.

41:47.358 --> 41:48.358
Stephanie, I'm sorry,

41:48.392 --> 41:49.626
but you have been eliminated.

41:49.660 --> 41:51.361
That means Emily,

41:51.395 --> 41:53.630
you're safe this week and can
head back to the makeup room.

41:53.664 --> 41:54.831
Thank you.

41:54.865 --> 41:56.232
Bye, Stephanie.

41:56.267 --> 41:57.934
[sniffles]

41:59.837 --> 42:02.639
(Neville) Stephanie, it's been a
privilege to have you with us

42:02.673 --> 42:04.574
and show us your talents.

42:04.608 --> 42:06.276
It's in you, we've seen it.

42:06.310 --> 42:08.478
And I'm looking forward
to seeing that in the future.

42:08.528 --> 42:10.010
Thank you.

42:10.063 --> 42:12.797
Stephanie, it's really been
great having you here with us.

42:12.849 --> 42:14.715
If you'd please head backstage

42:14.767 --> 42:15.699
and pack up your kit.

42:15.752 --> 42:17.668
Thank you so much, everyone.

42:17.703 --> 42:19.086
Good luck.

42:19.138 --> 42:20.504
(Stephanie)
Well, I'm goin' home,

42:20.556 --> 42:21.889
and it blows.

42:21.924 --> 42:24.875
I wanted to win.
That's why I came here.

42:26.796 --> 42:28.462
It's me.

42:28.498 --> 42:30.147
Aw.

42:30.199 --> 42:33.784
But I feel really good that I
made it to the final seven.

42:33.786 --> 42:35.836
What I like about you
is you know what you want to do

42:35.888 --> 42:37.338
and you're passionate.

42:37.373 --> 42:39.774
Watching you grow
this whole competition

42:39.826 --> 42:41.158
has been a privilege.

42:41.194 --> 42:42.593
Thanks.

42:42.628 --> 42:44.512
Even though I didn't make it
through all the way,

42:44.547 --> 42:45.613
I think I did awesome.

42:45.648 --> 42:47.631
I really impressed myself.

42:47.667 --> 42:49.834
It's a bittersweet kind of end
for me.

42:49.869 --> 42:52.286
Especially, like,
me looking like this.

42:52.338 --> 42:54.021
[Laughs]

42:54.056 --> 42:56.524
At least I'm goin' out lookin'
like a badass.
