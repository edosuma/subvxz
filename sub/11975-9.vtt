WEBVTT

00:09.100 --> 00:11.367
You guys.
Rob proposed in front of her

00:11.367 --> 00:13.533
whole family at her house last
night.

00:13.533 --> 00:15.800
And you don't even tell your
sisters?

00:15.800 --> 00:18.433
We basically wake up to
the news that my brother is

00:18.433 --> 00:20.500
engaged.
"None of the women jumped on

00:20.500 --> 00:22.267
social media to congratulate
him."

00:22.267 --> 00:23.933
Why would we
congratulate him?

00:23.933 --> 00:26.833
We were thinking of
staying tomorrow and skiing.

00:26.833 --> 00:29.500
- Me and Scott and the kids.
- It makes me really

00:29.500 --> 00:32.533
happy to know that Kourtney and
Scott are having so much fun

00:32.533 --> 00:36.967
that they want to stay another
day.

00:51.767 --> 00:53.667
Snapchat?

00:58.067 --> 00:59.967
Oh, my God.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.433
- And this is all Snapchat?
- Yeah, these are fun

01:05.433 --> 01:07.400
and I can record them for the
kids.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.767
But how many different
things are there?

01:09.767 --> 01:11.467
Tons?
Or do you have to download...

01:11.467 --> 01:13.000
And they change
daily.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.500
- Oh.
- Mase loves doing

01:14.500 --> 01:17.767
- them.
- I'm sure. He's six.

01:17.767 --> 01:19.633
Like, how this
offends you...

01:19.633 --> 01:23.100
You waste a lot of
time of your life on it.

01:23.100 --> 01:25.400
- That doesn't offend...
- That took one

01:25.400 --> 01:27.600
- second in glam.
- It didn't.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.167
- 100% didn't take one second.
- No, literally.

01:29.167 --> 01:30.600
- No.
- Do you know how

01:30.600 --> 01:33.567
many people say to me that my
snaps are, like, the best?

01:33.567 --> 01:35.367
What are they gonna
say, they suck?

01:35.367 --> 01:47.667
I don't ask them.â™ª â™ª

01:54.967 --> 01:57.567
How do you spell,
like, "Damn!"

01:57.567 --> 02:02.033
Is it, like, D-A-Y... "Daymn!"
Oh. D-A-Y... U-M.

02:02.033 --> 02:05.500
A-Y. Dayum!
U-M.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.833
- How was Vail?
- Vail was super fun.

02:07.833 --> 02:11.200
Went skiing, had some fun,
like, restaurant nights.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.500
Your brother doesn't
miss going on vacation with his

02:13.500 --> 02:15.233
- family, like...?
- He was invited.

02:15.233 --> 02:17.800
And he said he was coming and he
ditched it.

02:17.800 --> 02:20.400
- It's his life to choose.
- Do you feel like he

02:20.400 --> 02:23.100
won't do it because he feels
like you guys... like... he

02:23.100 --> 02:25.367
- can't bring her?
- I don't know what she

02:25.367 --> 02:27.467
- would do on our family trips.
- I don't know-- if

02:27.467 --> 02:29.300
she's about to be family, you
might want to start thinking

02:29.300 --> 02:31.900
- about it.
- I'm not struggling

02:31.900 --> 02:35.700
that Rob got engaged.
I'm offended that Rob hasn't

02:35.700 --> 02:38.767
said anything to us.
And I think the most frustrating

02:38.767 --> 02:42.433
part is Rob and I were
always super close.

02:42.433 --> 02:45.367
So I feel like the fact that he
hasn't said anything yet, it

02:45.367 --> 02:48.400
just... I mean, it hurts my
feelings, and I just want Rob to

02:48.400 --> 02:50.967
- reach out to me.
- It's still new.

02:50.967 --> 02:54.167
You guys might be able to grow
to, like, a very family, like,

02:54.167 --> 02:57.733
way.
Crazier things have happened.

02:57.733 --> 03:02.133
Mm-hmm.
My stepdad turned into a girl.

03:02.133 --> 03:03.900
Somehow, Lamar's back in our
lives, full-time.

03:03.900 --> 03:05.500
Like, crazier things have
happened.

03:05.500 --> 03:08.500
Crazier things have
happened.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.267
Ooh, Dad got you
something.

03:23.267 --> 03:24.800
- Ooh!
- And I got you little

03:24.800 --> 03:27.767
- toys, too.
- Popcorn!

03:27.767 --> 03:31.000
I think this trip
to Vail has been a big step for

03:31.000 --> 03:34.833
my family.
I think realizing that Scott can

03:34.833 --> 03:38.133
come on our family vacations was
big.

03:38.133 --> 03:41.400
I'm glad that we had that one
extra night in Vail, but there's

03:41.400 --> 03:45.967
a lot going on in L.A., so time
to get back to reality.

03:45.967 --> 03:49.967
Rob just texted me,

03:49.967 --> 03:54.100
Kim and Khloe.
"I just had a long talk with Mom

03:54.100 --> 03:57.833
in person, and I realized that
there are a lot of things we

03:57.833 --> 04:01.500
need to talk about, and I'd like
to talk to you three in person.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.167
I love you very much and I want
you in my life.

04:04.167 --> 04:07.300
Let's talk as soon as possible.
Rob."

04:07.300 --> 04:10.267
I am happy that Rob has reached
out.

04:10.267 --> 04:15.167
The last thing I want is drama
with my own brother, and I want

04:15.167 --> 04:18.967
to figure out a way so that
everybody can get along and be a

04:18.967 --> 04:21.667
- happy family.
- You realize, if they

04:21.667 --> 04:25.367
get married, her name is gonna
be "Blac Kardashian."

04:25.367 --> 04:28.000
- Yep.
- How random is that?

04:28.000 --> 04:40.600
Finally, somebody said it.

04:40.600 --> 04:45.233
- Hello, Mother.
- Hi.

04:45.233 --> 04:50.567
So what does "carpe diem" mean?
I think it means, like, Zen.

04:50.567 --> 04:52.567
It means "seize the
day."

04:52.567 --> 04:54.000
How come I don't know
that?

04:54.000 --> 04:55.767
You went to school a
long time ago.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.767
That's for sure.

04:57.767 --> 05:02.100
- Look what I just got.
- Another new dog?

05:02.100 --> 05:05.233
Ooh. Is that the final?
That's really cool.

05:05.233 --> 05:08.367
I am so lucky and
blessed to have found my

05:08.367 --> 05:11.467
passion, which is my cosmetic
line.

05:11.467 --> 05:16.167
I am having another one of my
Lip Kit restocks, and it's a lot

05:16.167 --> 05:19.733
of hard work, but it's so much
fun.

05:19.733 --> 05:24.467
- I love every minute of it.
- Friday is the Lip Kit

05:24.467 --> 05:28.733
- launch.
- I know. It's so soon.

05:28.733 --> 05:32.967
- You good?
- Yeah.

05:32.967 --> 05:37.733
I am a little nervous about my
next Lip Kit restock, because

05:37.733 --> 05:42.700
last time, my Web site was over
capacity and it crashed.

05:42.700 --> 05:45.800
There were so many negative
comments, and when people don't

05:45.800 --> 05:49.233
like something, it really
affects me more than anything

05:49.233 --> 05:52.433
else I've ever done.
I just want to make everything

05:52.433 --> 05:55.767
- perfect.
- I think you should

05:55.767 --> 05:58.800
actually give all of your
sisters one... and me.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.967
Are you gonna give a Lip Kit to
your dad?

06:00.967 --> 06:02.867
Mm-hmm.

06:12.067 --> 06:14.700
What the  is
that?

06:14.700 --> 06:17.000
That is the bowl that I
asked you if I could get, and

06:17.000 --> 06:18.467
- you said yes.
- And what did I say?

06:18.467 --> 06:20.467
- No, I said no.
- You said yes.

06:20.467 --> 06:22.300
- It's a copy?
- That's the exact

06:22.300 --> 06:24.267
bowl I have!
You said could you have mine, I

06:24.267 --> 06:26.067
- said no.
- I asked.

06:26.067 --> 06:28.767
Okay, you're
forgiven, then.

06:28.767 --> 06:31.000
I really think I'm
gonna cancel Dubai.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.167
What are you going
to Dubai for?

06:33.167 --> 06:36.233
I'm going for business.
Now I'm just rethinking the

06:36.233 --> 06:38.267
- whole thing.
- But why?

06:38.267 --> 06:40.733
I just think it's not
the greatest time to be away and

06:40.733 --> 06:43.667
- what if somebody needs me here?
- But why isn't it a

06:43.667 --> 06:46.633
- great time to be away?
- Just to go so far away

06:46.633 --> 06:51.167
with so many changes going on.
I have a trip coming up, for

06:51.167 --> 06:55.600
business, that includes going to
Dubai and the Maldives, but I've

06:55.600 --> 06:58.800
had an opportunity to sit down
with Rob and understand

06:58.800 --> 07:03.100
everything that's going on, but
no one else in the family has.

07:03.100 --> 07:07.967
So I feel extremely
irresponsible for leaving town.

07:07.967 --> 07:10.633
I just want to be here for Rob,
if he needs me.

07:10.633 --> 07:12.967
You're always
encouraging us to see our

07:12.967 --> 07:15.033
- obligations through.
- You've left me with

07:15.033 --> 07:18.400
him before.
Think you'll be fine.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.300
Rob wants to just
explain to his sisters a little

07:22.300 --> 07:25.600
bit more about the situation,
but it makes me really anxious

07:25.600 --> 07:30.433
- not to be there.
- Mom, I'm having really

07:30.433 --> 07:33.000
bad anxiety lately.
It's the worst feeling ever.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.233
I don't like to deal with this
kind of stuff.

07:36.233 --> 07:40.167
- Hello.
- Well, well, well.

07:40.167 --> 07:43.033
I haven't seen Rob in a really
long time.

07:43.033 --> 07:50.100
It's kind of awkward.
What are you gonna say?

07:58.200 --> 08:00.833
Everyone seems so
excited to see me!

08:00.833 --> 08:02.600
All right, let's scoot,
scoot this way.

08:02.600 --> 08:06.867
- I was.
- I'm wearing my

08:06.867 --> 08:09.633
- Kylie Lip Kit today.
- What color? Candy?

08:09.633 --> 08:11.900
Mm-hmm.
- It's super cute.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.500
- Khloe, I have an orange shade...
- Well, you didn't give

08:14.500 --> 08:16.433
it to me, so, you know...

08:16.433 --> 08:17.867
Well, it's not out
yet.

08:17.867 --> 08:20.333
Oh, but Jordyn gets to
wear it.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.100
- Okrrr?
- Well, whatever.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.933
Mom, who did your
makeup yesterday?

08:24.933 --> 08:27.267
- Joyce.
- You looked so good.

08:27.267 --> 08:29.167
The best I've seen
you look in a long time.

08:29.167 --> 08:31.767
Well, good, I'll get
booed more often.

08:31.767 --> 08:34.633
I was so upset I didn't know
what to do, so I'm texting Kim,

08:34.633 --> 08:38.033
"I just got booed.
What do I do?"

08:38.033 --> 08:40.600
I was saying to Kourt,
like, when I was at the

08:40.600 --> 08:43.600
basketball game and I got booed,
like, it's just one person and

08:43.600 --> 08:45.167
then, like, the... it's like
the wave.

08:45.167 --> 08:46.767
- One person starts...
- Like, who the  wants to

08:46.767 --> 08:49.567
do the wave?
But everyone just copies.

08:49.567 --> 08:51.400
I was, like, very
upset.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.067
If you're gonna get
booed, at least look good.

08:53.067 --> 08:55.533
- And you looked good.
- Hearing my mom talk

08:55.533 --> 08:59.400
about how she got booed at an
appearance, I so feel for her.

08:59.400 --> 09:02.133
And that's the worst feeling
ever.

09:02.133 --> 09:05.333
Stories like that just stress me
out, and that's why I don't like

09:05.333 --> 09:08.900
- to deal with this kind of stuff.
- Thank you.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.200
Mom, I'm having really
bad anxiety lately.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.133
What are you doing
when you notice it the most?

09:14.133 --> 09:16.767
When I'm working a
lot.

09:16.767 --> 09:19.133
Are you just
overwhelmed or you just feel

09:19.133 --> 09:21.600
- like you have too much going on?
- It's really hard to

09:21.600 --> 09:24.700
explain, but it's, like,
something in your mind, that how

09:24.700 --> 09:26.700
your brain works, like, you
overthink a lot.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.900
Kourtney had that for a
long time.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.300
I had, like, a
therapist on call, and I would

09:31.300 --> 09:33.633
just talk to her on the phone
for an hour and talk about

09:33.633 --> 09:35.400
everything, like,
sometimes daily.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.000
I always talk about
it.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.267
- I'm talking about it right now.
- I totally forget

09:40.267 --> 09:44.933
that Kylie's 18 years old and
that she is doing so much, and

09:44.933 --> 09:49.100
then on top of it, being really
famous and having her every move

09:49.100 --> 09:53.667
watched and judged is pretty
insane.

09:53.667 --> 09:56.333
When you're really anxious,
you're not supposed to

09:56.333 --> 09:59.900
drink caffeine, alcohol or have
excessive sweets.

09:59.900 --> 10:19.300
- Yeah.
- That's horrible.

10:19.300 --> 10:22.800
Ready?
Kris, this is Diala Makki.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.467
- Hi. How are you?
- Pleasure to meet you.

10:24.467 --> 10:29.767
And my good friend,
as well.

10:29.767 --> 10:31.767
You have five
grandchildren now?

10:31.767 --> 10:33.800
- I do.
- And your daughters

10:33.800 --> 10:36.867
are getting more successful day
by day.

10:36.867 --> 10:40.600
Is-is it more difficult to spend
time together now as a family?

10:40.600 --> 10:43.667
Do you have to work harder at
getting everybody... I know you

10:43.667 --> 10:46.100
hijacked your family and put
them on a plane and took them on

10:46.100 --> 10:48.400
a vacation.
I did. I did.

10:48.400 --> 10:53.267
I said "Be there or else."
I really need to be focused on

10:53.267 --> 10:56.100
- my business trip.
- Thank you.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.367
But at the same time, I
can't help but wonder what's

10:58.367 --> 11:01.900
going on, and I just wish I was
at home.

11:01.900 --> 11:05.300
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

11:05.300 --> 11:08.233
All right, where are we
going?

11:08.233 --> 11:13.333
Great.
I'm obsessed with watches.

11:13.333 --> 11:15.167
- Me, too.
- And I love...

11:15.167 --> 11:17.100
Hello.

11:17.100 --> 11:20.100
- It's Rob.
- Hi.

11:20.100 --> 11:25.533
What are you doing?
Oh, wow. Okay.

11:25.533 --> 11:27.933
All right, well, I'm just about
to go...

11:27.933 --> 11:32.867
Okay, bye. Love you.
Okay, that was Rob.

11:32.867 --> 11:37.133
Rob calls me to tell me that
he's gonna meet his sisters,

11:37.133 --> 11:40.133
and it makes me extremely
nervous.

11:40.133 --> 11:44.967
I really pray that they will
solve their differences and

11:44.967 --> 12:00.667
see things eye-to-eye.
I just need a glass of water.

12:00.667 --> 12:03.300
You know I shot my
cover yesterday.

12:03.300 --> 12:05.600
- Yeah, how was it?
- Great. I love Yu

12:05.600 --> 12:07.600
- Tsai.
- How crazy is he?

12:07.600 --> 12:09.300
Like, he tells you
what to do.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.833
"Smile. Keep that smile."
Then he's like, "Okay, now,

12:11.833 --> 12:13.433
stop smiling."
And then he's like,

12:13.433 --> 12:15.933
"But smile through your eyes."
I would think that you

12:15.933 --> 12:18.333
- would not like that personality.
- No, I loved it.

12:18.333 --> 12:22.633
Why is Kylie having a talk

12:22.633 --> 12:24.633
- with Scott right now?
- I don't know.

12:24.633 --> 12:26.133
- About what?
- I don't know.

12:26.133 --> 12:28.100
He's like, "I'm with Kylie.
We're having a talk."

12:28.100 --> 12:29.500
- About what?
- I didn't ask.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.933
Oh, that's what I
just asked you.

12:30.933 --> 12:33.100
I feel like she was
just, like, in an anxious mood.

12:33.100 --> 12:35.567
She kept saying to me, "I'm so
anxious. I'm so anxious."

12:35.567 --> 12:38.900
And so, I was like, you know,
"Working out helps a lot.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.933
Work out with me."
Oh, I mean, for me,

12:40.933 --> 12:43.333
like, workouts took away so much
of my anxiety.

12:43.333 --> 12:45.200
- Same.
- That's my place of

12:45.200 --> 12:47.200
- solitude...
- Me, too. I'm like,

12:47.200 --> 12:49.500
- I have to work out.
- Just mentally, what it

12:49.500 --> 12:51.800
does for you and that release.
What up, girl?

12:51.800 --> 12:55.267
I had such a good
workout with Don the other day.

12:55.267 --> 12:58.100
Oh, I love him.
Like, he's so nice.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.600
This guy works out all day long.
He has the most energy I've ever

13:00.600 --> 13:02.667
seen.
He's not fazed by you and I

13:02.667 --> 13:04.433
- whatsoever.
- I forgot to tell

13:04.433 --> 13:06.667
him.
He was like, "I want to come to

13:06.667 --> 13:11.667
your shoot."
Who, Don?

13:11.667 --> 13:14.333
Who, Don wants to?

13:30.333 --> 13:32.567
Mase.
Mase.

13:32.567 --> 13:37.433
- Hello.
- What's up?

13:37.433 --> 13:41.033
Hello.
What's up?

13:41.033 --> 13:44.367
Well, well, well.
What do we have here?

13:44.367 --> 13:48.100
- Oh, a new sweat suit finally.
- Same one.

13:48.100 --> 13:50.233
Same one I wore ten days

13:50.233 --> 13:53.767
in a row.
Where's Kourt?

13:53.767 --> 13:56.100
- Kourtney?
- Rob and I can't be

13:56.100 --> 13:59.467
left alone together for too
long. Kourtney.

13:59.467 --> 14:03.267
This is uncomfortable.
I love my brother, but I haven't

14:03.267 --> 14:07.267
seen Rob in, I feel like, a
really long time, so I can't

14:07.267 --> 14:09.100
lie.
It's a little awkward.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.600
And it's almost like we don't
want to be left alone together,

14:11.600 --> 14:17.400
- which is kind of weird.
- How was Vail?

14:17.400 --> 14:20.833
It was good.
Good memories.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.667
Mm, I was supposed to
go.

14:23.667 --> 14:25.900
- I know you were.
- No one told me it was a

14:25.900 --> 14:28.033
- ski trip.
- Okay.

14:28.033 --> 14:30.167
- So...
- No one told you it was

14:30.167 --> 14:32.233
- a ski trip.
- Mom says we were flying

14:32.233 --> 14:34.367
an hour and a half away.
I had a stylist come over and

14:34.367 --> 14:37.000
- get me all shorts.
- You always find some

14:37.000 --> 14:40.433
- loophole excuse.
- Not gonna go on a ski

14:40.433 --> 14:42.267
trip with no-- with nothing.
Sorry.

14:42.267 --> 14:44.267
- No, it's...
- There's plenty of time

14:44.267 --> 14:45.933
in the year to go on a family
trip.

14:45.933 --> 14:48.000
Well, if that's your
mentality, then things will

14:48.000 --> 14:49.533
- never happen.
- There is plenty of time

14:49.533 --> 14:51.067
- in this year to go on a...
- So there's plenty of

14:51.067 --> 14:52.733
time for you to do what you
got to do, right?

14:52.733 --> 14:54.567
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Hey.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.200
Do we want to sit
in here?

15:00.200 --> 15:01.700
It's your house; you
decide where to sit.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.167
You can't leave Rob
and I alone together for too

15:03.167 --> 15:04.500
- long.
- Wait, have you seen

15:04.500 --> 15:05.867
- my movie theater room?
- No, we'll go check it

15:05.867 --> 15:07.133
- out.
- Check it out after.

15:07.133 --> 15:08.900
- We'll check it out now.
- The play room and

15:08.900 --> 15:11.667
the movie theater are
downstairs.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.767
- Hi. What are you doing?
- You look thin.

15:13.767 --> 15:15.133
- I look thin?
- Yeah.

15:15.133 --> 15:18.067
What do you think he's
gonna talk to us about?

15:18.067 --> 15:20.733
We were left alone
together for too long, and he

15:20.733 --> 15:22.900
had an attitude, so I'm not
gonna talk a lot.

15:22.900 --> 15:24.633
- It's like...
- Yeah, I think you just

15:24.633 --> 15:26.967
have to, like, you know what?
It's not your life.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.433
I'm gonna refrain from
talking.

15:29.433 --> 15:32.967
Yeah. Just be quiet.
Khloe and Rob have, like, this,

15:32.967 --> 15:36.433
you know, history of growing up
so close together.

15:36.433 --> 15:40.933
So Khloe is obviously taking
this harder than all of us.

15:40.933 --> 15:43.100
And I really do feel bad for
her.

15:43.100 --> 15:47.100
- Hey.
- My favorite sister.

15:47.100 --> 15:50.267
Khloe should probably sit over
there.

15:50.267 --> 15:52.733
Why? 'Cause I'm too
close to you?

15:52.733 --> 15:54.533
- You're in close reach.
- It's just better.

15:54.533 --> 15:56.133
Like I'm gonna hit
you?

15:56.133 --> 15:57.800
- Let's just switch.
- What are you gonna

15:57.800 --> 16:00.167
- say?
- I know you guys

16:00.167 --> 16:04.133
obviously know what happened,
just based on... whatever.

16:04.133 --> 16:06.000
- Social media.
- Social media.

16:06.000 --> 16:09.967
But everything that happened,
I'm very happy about.

16:09.967 --> 16:11.867
- It was something that I...
- So, like, did you get

16:11.867 --> 16:14.033
on, like, one knee?
I gave her

16:14.033 --> 16:16.233
the ring, and then I got on the
knee after.

16:16.233 --> 16:18.967
It happened, like,
spontaneously, so that's why you

16:18.967 --> 16:21.433
guys weren't in the loop,
'cause I was gonna do this

16:21.433 --> 16:23.500
regardless.
I just didn't know when,

16:23.500 --> 16:25.700
- and it just ended up happening.
- We want to be honest

16:25.700 --> 16:27.667
with you.
We felt like we should have just

16:27.667 --> 16:30.000
at least got a text and say,
"Hey, guys, I know you're seeing

16:30.000 --> 16:31.667
this on social media.
It's true."

16:31.667 --> 16:33.833
People were asking us, and we
were like, "We don't even know

16:33.833 --> 16:36.033
if it's true."
If you guys really were

16:36.033 --> 16:38.367
concerned and wanted to know,
you guys would have said,

16:38.367 --> 16:40.733
"Is this true?
Congratulations, you just got

16:40.733 --> 16:42.733
engaged."
Obviously, you think I'm just

16:42.733 --> 16:45.033
gonna post some fake
because I'm a media whore?

16:45.033 --> 16:46.467
- Never in my life.
- Why would I say

16:46.467 --> 16:48.033
congratulations if I don't know
if it's true or not?

16:48.033 --> 16:49.567
It's the first time I
ever proposed to someone in my

16:49.567 --> 16:50.967
life.
Why would I joke with that?

16:50.967 --> 16:52.567
- I don't joke with that.
- We understand, you

16:52.567 --> 16:54.200
- know...
- It's a two-way street.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.133
You guys could easily have
picked up the phone and called

16:56.133 --> 16:57.833
me.
No, I'm not gonna talk to you

16:57.833 --> 17:01.300
guys when you guys are in a room
with Tyga on a ski trip.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.033
But yet you put it on
social media.

17:03.033 --> 17:05.000
That's not the point.
You act like I'm supposed to

17:05.000 --> 17:06.933
just call you guys and just say,
"Oh, this and that," when you

17:06.933 --> 17:08.267
- hate this girl.
- We would have

17:08.267 --> 17:09.600
- appreciated that.
- So it's like...

17:09.600 --> 17:11.333
- But we love you.
- That's great.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.000
So we would have
appreciated that.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.467
- And she loves me.
- We're happy for you.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.633
Of course we would
be happy for you.

17:17.633 --> 17:20.400
But we're allowed to be hurt
that you didn't tell us, but

17:20.400 --> 17:22.967
we're also... you're allowed to
do it in your own way.

17:22.967 --> 17:25.967
We see that you're
happy, and that's all that

17:25.967 --> 17:28.733
matters to us, really.
Like, we obviously have tried to

17:28.733 --> 17:31.733
get you out of the house for
years, you know, and that hasn't

17:31.733 --> 17:34.667
worked.
And so, if someone else can do

17:34.667 --> 17:40.100
that, like, we are really, you
know, thankful for that.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.533
Do you understand that that was
hurtful to us that we found out

17:43.533 --> 17:45.533
about your engagement on social
media?

17:45.533 --> 17:47.967
Yes, I understand, but I
didn't understand.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.967
I didn't... I wasn't even
thinking that at the time.

17:49.967 --> 17:52.533
It happened so fast, but I get
I upset you guys.

17:52.533 --> 17:54.333
I get I'm your brother,
your only brother.

17:54.333 --> 17:56.400
You would like to know when
something important like this

17:56.400 --> 17:59.900
happens.
I apologize 'cause I wasn't

17:59.900 --> 18:03.767
trying to be rude.
So...

18:03.767 --> 18:06.300
And then there's one more thing
I have to talk to you guys

18:06.300 --> 18:10.100
about.
I don't want you guys to get

18:10.100 --> 18:12.000
mad.

18:14.967 --> 18:17.500
- Let's do this.
- Today is the day of my

18:17.500 --> 18:19.267
- Lip Kit restock.
- This is how many

18:19.267 --> 18:20.967
people are on the site right
now.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.033
What? What?

18:23.033 --> 18:24.567
It stopped.
I think they literally just

18:24.567 --> 18:26.933
- broke it.
- Kourt and I wanted to

18:26.933 --> 18:29.433
call you because now we
obviously talked to Rob.

18:29.433 --> 18:31.433
What did he say when
you talked to him?

18:31.433 --> 18:33.667
You know, just a lot.
There's nothing we can do.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.567
What's done is done.

18:39.067 --> 18:42.300
There's one more thing I
have to talk to you guys about,

18:42.300 --> 18:45.900
but I don't want you guys to get
mad.

18:45.900 --> 18:47.800
What?

18:50.833 --> 19:00.467
- You're having a baby.
- Yeah.

19:00.467 --> 19:02.100
- Just so you know...
- Are you being serious?

19:02.100 --> 19:04.167
No, I'm being Bible.
I'm being deadass, but you have

19:04.167 --> 19:06.967
to understand I've been trying
to do this.

19:06.967 --> 19:09.200
I'm not even kidding.
This was, like, really my

19:09.200 --> 19:11.400
decision.
It, like, really wasn't hers.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.400
On Dad's grave, on everything,
I'm Bible.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.900
- Did you tell Mom?
- Yeah, Mom knows.

19:16.900 --> 19:20.233
She didn't want me to say
anything to Mom and you guys

19:20.233 --> 19:24.000
until she was three months, but
I want Mom and you guys involved

19:24.000 --> 19:26.933
'cause I think it would be
worse, since obviously

19:26.933 --> 19:29.900
the engagement thing,
how you all reacted and then she

19:29.900 --> 19:32.500
starts to show or something,
but...

19:32.500 --> 19:34.833
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

19:34.833 --> 19:38.733
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

19:38.733 --> 19:40.500
I know Khloe's probably
feeling...

19:40.500 --> 19:43.967
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

19:43.967 --> 19:46.267
I don't know my
emotions right now.

19:46.267 --> 19:50.800
I know I feel... I feel more
empty and more unresolved than

19:50.800 --> 19:56.933
anything else, and... I'm, like,
internally sad.

19:56.933 --> 19:59.633
- Are you excited?
- I'm excited, yes, but I

19:59.633 --> 20:01.933
know you guys, uh, probably feel
really weird.

20:01.933 --> 20:06.367
I mean, I don't expect you guys
to be all happy, but...

20:06.367 --> 20:09.467
I'm sure you guys will
eventually.

20:09.467 --> 20:13.167
So...
She's not a bad girl at all.

20:13.167 --> 20:15.633
She's really loyal and
she helps me a lot with trying

20:15.633 --> 20:17.800
to get back on track and...
which is good.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.233
So, obviously I want you all a
part of it because

20:21.233 --> 20:24.767
it's gonna happen, so there
definitely needs to be a talk

20:24.767 --> 20:27.033
between all you guys, 'cause
she's not going anywhere.

20:27.033 --> 20:29.033
She knows I'm gonna be in her
life.

20:29.033 --> 20:30.800
She knows you guys aren't going
anywhere.

20:30.800 --> 20:33.133
I don't want it to be where it's
just like y'all don't have a

20:33.133 --> 20:41.633
relationship.
That's just weird.

20:41.633 --> 20:44.267
I do think a baby is a
blessing.

20:44.267 --> 20:47.000
I think that if this is gonna
get Rob to get his

20:47.000 --> 20:50.467
together, cool, but I personally
don't know what the next step

20:50.467 --> 20:53.867
for Rob and his girlfriend and
all of us are.

20:53.867 --> 20:56.800
- I mean, that's up to Rob.
- Obviously, things aren't

20:56.800 --> 20:58.767
gonna be, like, perfect
overnight.

20:58.767 --> 21:00.267
No, I know, but I just
wanted to...

21:00.267 --> 21:01.800
You know, I think we
should talk, you know.

21:01.800 --> 21:04.533
Yeah.
It has to start somewhere, and

21:04.533 --> 21:07.200
that's why I started with Mom
and then you guys, and I'll have

21:07.200 --> 21:10.833
my talk with Kendall and Kylie,
but I wouldn't make a decision

21:10.833 --> 21:14.833
like this if I wasn't all the
way sure with everything.

21:14.833 --> 21:17.067
- What?
- That's exciting.

21:17.067 --> 21:20.300
Babies are a blessing.
Who would have thought Rob

21:20.300 --> 21:25.000
would've been the one to join
the... North and Saint and

21:25.000 --> 21:29.500
everybody?
Who is that little guy?

21:29.500 --> 21:33.200
- Come on.
- Hi.

21:33.200 --> 21:44.833
- Ow.
- Ow!

21:44.833 --> 21:47.000
Hey.
Today is Freestyle Friday, so

21:47.000 --> 21:49.000
we're not doing the
motivational quote thing right

21:49.000 --> 21:50.700
now, we're just gonna jump into
the workout...

21:50.700 --> 21:52.033
- All right.
- ...and get it done.

21:52.033 --> 21:53.800
- Freestyle Friday!
- It's Friday!

21:53.800 --> 21:55.733
"Could not send."

21:55.733 --> 21:57.767
Kourtney, what the  is up
with your Wi-Fi?

21:57.767 --> 22:00.533
You have this big-ass house and
you can't afford a Wi-Fi box out

22:00.533 --> 22:02.400
- here?
- It's not about

22:02.400 --> 22:05.633
- affording, it's about radiation.
- You're gonna die

22:05.633 --> 22:07.567
anyway.
You understand that, right?

22:07.567 --> 22:09.933
Die with a good Snapchat going
through.

22:09.933 --> 22:12.300
- What the?
- Hey.

22:12.300 --> 22:16.767
- Kylie is here!
- Yay, you made it to

22:16.767 --> 22:18.833
- the family workout.
- Kylie is here!

22:18.833 --> 22:21.133
Hi, you guys.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.200
Kylie, get ready to

22:23.200 --> 22:25.700
- crush your anxiety.
- Crush it.

22:25.700 --> 22:28.267
Khloe and I have a
lot going on in our lives.

22:28.267 --> 22:30.633
We have, like, the
best lives and also the most

22:30.633 --> 22:32.367
up lives at the same
time.

22:32.367 --> 22:34.767
So, this is what
gets us through our days.

22:34.767 --> 22:36.400
- Here we go.
- Okay.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.233
Three, two, one.
Let's go.

22:39.233 --> 22:41.400
One.
20 seconds. Two.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.367
I'm so surprised you
could jump rope.

22:43.367 --> 22:45.933
Kim can't.
Like, we had to cut the jump

22:45.933 --> 22:49.733
rope over her.
She just swings the rope around.

22:49.733 --> 22:51.567
Good. Drop your ropes
right there.

22:51.567 --> 22:54.033
Okay, guys,
I don't know if I'm gonna

22:54.033 --> 22:56.100
- finish this.
- It's just the warm-up.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.833
I need to go home and
take a shower and get ready for

22:57.833 --> 22:59.567
- the day.
- Do one quarter and

22:59.567 --> 23:01.433
- just try it.
- I kind of want to

23:01.433 --> 23:04.267
- leave.
- Just do at least one

23:04.267 --> 23:07.200
- quarter.
- One leg up, we're going

23:07.200 --> 23:10.100
30 seconds.
One, drop.

23:10.100 --> 23:13.800
- Two, slow it down.
- Kylie really just

23:13.800 --> 23:18.000
seems like her head is
not here this morning.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.367
- You only did one quarter.
- I know.

23:20.367 --> 23:21.833
There's three more to
do and possibly overtime.

23:21.833 --> 23:23.733
You at least got to do
half.

23:23.733 --> 23:25.633
You know, Kylie being
so young and there's so much

23:25.633 --> 23:28.700
pressure and focus on her life,
I could definitely understand

23:28.700 --> 23:31.167
why she feels anxious a ton of
the time,

23:31.167 --> 23:35.100
but I know Kylie just has to
find what it is that will take

23:35.100 --> 23:38.700
- away that anxiety.
- I love you guys.

23:38.700 --> 23:40.900
Think about if you did
four, how good you would feel.

23:40.900 --> 23:42.800
Love you.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.700
Excuse me, can I help
you?

23:56.700 --> 23:58.633
- No.
- Well, that's not how

23:58.633 --> 24:01.600
you shut it.
Put the stick back.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.200
- Which one?
- That big one.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.500
Now pull it out.
Pull the drawer out.

24:06.500 --> 24:09.400
There you go.
Everything has a home.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.500
- You have a home.
- I do and you're in my

24:12.500 --> 24:15.133
home.
It's been real.

24:15.133 --> 24:17.900
- It's been so good.
- Should we call Mom

24:17.900 --> 24:20.367
- and tell her we talked to Rob?
- She's obviously known.

24:20.367 --> 24:23.800
That's obviously why she was
tripping out like that and not

24:23.800 --> 24:26.500
wanting to go, and I think if
she just knows that we're cool,

24:26.500 --> 24:30.000
- then she'll feel better.
- Yeah.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.567
Hello.

24:33.567 --> 24:37.067
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi there, pussycat.

24:37.067 --> 24:40.300
Oh.
How is Dubai going?

24:40.300 --> 24:43.367
The jet lag is always a
challenge for me, but other than

24:43.367 --> 24:45.267
that, it's all good.
What's going on?

24:45.267 --> 24:47.300
Well, nothing.
Kourt and I wanted to call you

24:47.300 --> 24:50.967
because now we obviously
talked to Rob, and we now know

24:50.967 --> 24:54.700
why you were so hesitant about
leaving and that we're all good

24:54.700 --> 24:57.233
over here, and there's nothing
you could do if you stayed here,

24:57.233 --> 24:59.833
- so don't worry about that.
- What did he say when

24:59.833 --> 25:02.267
- you talked to him?
- You know, just a lot,

25:02.267 --> 25:04.833
a lot to digest, um...

25:07.067 --> 25:10.600
You know, there's nothing we can
do, what's done is done, so...

25:10.600 --> 25:15.467
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

25:15.467 --> 25:18.500
My mom was planning on going to
the Maldives right after her

25:18.500 --> 25:21.267
Dubai trip.
She wants to be here for Rob,

25:21.267 --> 25:23.967
but Rob and all of us sisters,
we're good.

25:23.967 --> 25:26.633
There's no reason why she has to
rush back home.

25:26.633 --> 25:29.200
If anything, she needs this
vacation and she deserves this

25:29.200 --> 25:31.567
- vacation.
- Thanks for letting me

25:31.567 --> 25:33.267
know.
I'm fine now that you called and

25:33.267 --> 25:35.467
you guys are there, and it makes
me feel better.

25:35.467 --> 25:37.467
I love you guys, and I'll be
home soon. Bye, guys.

25:37.467 --> 25:41.300
- Bye.
- Love you.

25:41.300 --> 25:44.400
Kylie and Chyna-- they
were upstairs, Mom?

25:44.400 --> 25:46.267
- Yeah.
- Seeing this picture of

25:46.267 --> 25:49.000
Kylie and Chyna together, I
thought it was Photoshopped.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.500
- This is crazy.
- So how's your anxiety?

25:52.500 --> 25:55.500
I can't handle it.
I care too much, I read too

25:55.500 --> 25:58.133
- many things.
- No, but I was like that.

25:58.133 --> 26:06.033
I just know I'm not
supposed to be famous.

26:14.933 --> 26:19.533
This looks nice.
Fantasy

26:19.533 --> 26:21.433
Island.

26:26.567 --> 26:29.900
I was really anxious to
leave town at a time when my

26:29.900 --> 26:34.400
family really needs me, but I
got a call from the kids, and

26:34.400 --> 26:39.633
everything's all good with the
girls and Rob.

26:39.633 --> 26:42.367
It just gives me the
confirmation that I really

26:42.367 --> 26:53.367
needed to take a minute away
from the situation and relax.

26:53.367 --> 26:57.133
Wow, this is so cool.
Cheers.

26:57.133 --> 27:00.267
- Cheers, baby.
- This is peaceful.

27:00.267 --> 27:02.533
This makes you like you're
one of the fish.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.433
Yeah.
Look at the teeth!

27:04.433 --> 27:07.600
Why have rabbit teeth as a fish?

27:07.600 --> 27:10.067
Here comes the
whole school.

27:10.067 --> 27:12.133
- They all travel together.
- Yeah.

27:12.133 --> 27:15.467
It's like my kids.
Okay, if you were Kylie, what

27:15.467 --> 27:17.967
- fish would you be?
- I'm gonna pick out

27:17.967 --> 27:20.400
- Kylie for you.
- Okay. It has to be,

27:20.400 --> 27:23.933
like, big lips.

27:23.933 --> 27:25.933
- And Kendall.
- That's Kendall right

27:25.933 --> 27:27.700
here.
It's pretty.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.300
Uh-huh.
There goes Kim.

27:29.300 --> 27:31.200
- Hello.
- This is the paparazzi

27:31.200 --> 27:33.333
and they're trying to find Kim.

27:33.333 --> 27:36.700
Oh, look at this one.
Look at this one.

27:36.700 --> 27:40.167
That could be Rob.
I kind of miss the kids.

27:40.167 --> 27:42.033
We're almost home,
baby.

27:42.033 --> 27:46.533
- Back to Hidden Hills.
- Sometimes in life, you

27:46.533 --> 27:50.733
just need to take a minute and
walk away from a situation in

27:50.733 --> 27:53.300
order to see things more
clearly.

27:53.300 --> 27:58.800
I'm having another grandchild,
and I'm Rob's mom, and I need to

27:58.800 --> 28:04.267
just be as loving and positive
as possible for him, because

28:04.267 --> 28:06.500
that's what they need right now.
Oh...

28:06.500 --> 28:08.300
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Those two are pissed

28:08.300 --> 28:09.967
- off.
- He's probably getting

28:09.967 --> 28:12.200
after his bitch; he like, "Girl,
where the  you been

28:12.200 --> 28:15.100
swimming at all night?"

28:15.100 --> 28:18.033
You...
Okay, it's-it's time to go.

28:18.033 --> 28:23.233
We've been under the water way
too long.

28:23.233 --> 28:33.600
I'm getting a little worried
about you.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.467
This is nice.
I've never been out here.

28:36.467 --> 28:39.433
Me neither.
It's kind of cool that it has,

28:39.433 --> 28:41.767
- like, a ledge.
- I know.

28:41.767 --> 28:43.500
Hey, Bambi, come here,

28:43.500 --> 28:45.267
- Boots.
- Oh.

28:45.267 --> 28:48.633
Ew, this dog smells so bad.

28:48.633 --> 28:51.100
- She farted.
- I think you feed

28:51.100 --> 28:53.067
them weird food.
No.

28:53.067 --> 28:56.900
I honestly just can't
imagine having a pet.

28:56.900 --> 29:02.300
So how's your anxiety?

29:02.300 --> 29:04.667
I don't know, I just
feel like I've been dealing with

29:04.667 --> 29:07.100
anxiety for so long.
It's just a thing.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.833
Like, you just get
overwhelmed.

29:08.833 --> 29:11.000
Yeah, some people are
born for this life and some

29:11.000 --> 29:14.633
people aren't, and I just know
I'm not supposed to be famous.

29:14.633 --> 29:21.567
Like, I can feel it deep down
inside.

29:21.567 --> 29:24.467
Her and I were talking
about, like, Tyga a lot.

29:24.467 --> 29:27.367
And honestly, people need to
make up and get over things,

29:27.367 --> 29:28.967
- and, like...
- I'm just gonna

29:28.967 --> 29:30.900
start minding my own business.

29:35.067 --> 29:37.367
Some people are born
for this life and some people

29:37.367 --> 29:41.700
aren't, and I just know I'm not
supposed to be famous.

29:41.700 --> 29:44.033
Like, I can feel it deep down
inside.

29:44.033 --> 29:45.400
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.500
- That makes me so sad.
- I'm not supposed to be

29:47.500 --> 29:49.400
- famous...
- I'm not either, for

29:49.400 --> 29:51.167
- sure.
- Yeah.

29:51.167 --> 29:53.800
- I am.
- I know you are.

29:53.800 --> 29:56.533
- Because you can handle it.
- I can handle it, I

29:56.533 --> 29:58.567
- just don't give a.
- I can't handle it, and

29:58.567 --> 30:02.167
I give a.
I care too much, I read too many

30:02.167 --> 30:05.800
- things.
- No, but I was like that.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.367
At the beginning, I would go
out, I'd come home, and I'd sit

30:08.367 --> 30:10.267
home on the computer all night
long.

30:10.267 --> 30:13.133
- Yup.
- I do sympathize with

30:13.133 --> 30:16.400
Kylie.
It does take really thick skin

30:16.400 --> 30:20.500
to not read the comments, and it
took me up until about two years

30:20.500 --> 30:23.900
ago for me to get that way.
So I can understand that she is,

30:23.900 --> 30:26.933
like, in the height of it all
and she has so much attention

30:26.933 --> 30:29.800
around her, but your life is
just so much better when you

30:29.800 --> 30:31.933
don't pay too much attention to
it.

30:31.933 --> 30:35.533
I used to literally spend all my
days, like, just worried about

30:35.533 --> 30:39.833
media and, like, I was just so
obsessed.

30:39.833 --> 30:41.300
And then what
happened?

30:41.300 --> 30:43.300
You just stopped caring and you
realized you couldn't please

30:43.300 --> 30:46.000
- everybody?
- Kanye didn't care, so

30:46.000 --> 30:48.867
being around someone that, like,
doesn't care as much, you just

30:48.867 --> 30:51.000
let it go.
I couldn't even tell you the

30:51.000 --> 30:53.667
last time I looked at a
magazine, and I wouldn't even

30:53.667 --> 30:58.100
- care.
- I'm surprised to hear

30:58.100 --> 31:01.700
that Kim struggled with being
famous in the past, too, and it

31:01.700 --> 31:04.800
does give me a little hope that
if she got through it, I can,

31:04.800 --> 31:07.033
too.
Yeah, it's just been like this

31:07.033 --> 31:09.433
for too long.
Like, I'm way too young for

31:09.433 --> 31:11.267
- this.
- But don't you think

31:11.267 --> 31:13.700
that, like, you're like a normal
person at a party?

31:13.700 --> 31:15.233
- Not really.
- Yeah.

31:15.233 --> 31:16.833
I just don't like
parties at all.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.967
I know. On the way
walking you to the car, you're

31:18.967 --> 31:21.933
like, "By the way, I hate
parties."

31:21.933 --> 31:34.800
I hate parties.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.633
- Hi!
- We are here.

31:38.633 --> 31:40.500
Should we talk about
Lip Kit and go through some of

31:40.500 --> 31:42.167
- the stuff right now?
- Yeah.

31:42.167 --> 31:45.767
So this is what they're getting.
The box is epic.

31:45.767 --> 31:48.500
And then Kylie's note, "Thank
you so much for purchasing your

31:48.500 --> 31:50.967
Kylie Lip Kit.
I hope you enjoy using it, and I

31:50.967 --> 31:53.700
want to thank you for joining me
on my journey."

31:53.700 --> 31:58.333
Kylie, this is so good.
We have 25 minutes to go.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.833
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
- I know.

31:59.833 --> 32:04.900
- I'm getting nervous.
- I am stressing out

32:04.900 --> 32:09.533
right now because today's the
day of my Lip Kit restock and

32:09.533 --> 32:12.900
I really hope that everything
goes perfect so that no one has

32:12.900 --> 32:17.367
anything negative to say.
So I'm gonna post photo before,

32:17.367 --> 32:21.167
and I'm gonna say, "All six
shades are now available on

32:21.167 --> 32:24.300
- kyliecosmetics.com," right?
- Kyliecosmetics.com.

32:24.300 --> 32:26.967
You guys, we're, like
just a few minutes.

32:26.967 --> 32:29.733
- Yay.
- Okay, guys, showtime,

32:29.733 --> 32:32.833
go time.
Let's do this.

32:32.833 --> 32:35.533
I'm scared, I'm
scared!

32:35.533 --> 32:37.300
This is how many
people are on the site right

32:37.300 --> 32:39.033
- now.
- 14,000?

32:39.033 --> 32:40.700
- 14,000.
- Wow.

32:40.700 --> 32:42.467
- We're up.
- People have a feeling,

32:42.467 --> 32:43.933
- they have a feeling.
- I'm having, like,

32:43.933 --> 32:45.633
- heart palpitations.
- I know. Me, too.

32:45.633 --> 32:47.533
I think I'm gonna cry or
something.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.267
- Okay, it's 8:59.
- Oh, look how people are

32:49.267 --> 32:51.067
- starting to jump on.
- All right, tell me

32:51.067 --> 32:54.100
when I can post.
It's 9:00, it's 9:00.

32:54.100 --> 32:55.500
- I just shared it.
- I did it.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.933
It's 9:00.

32:57.933 --> 33:00.933
- What?
- It stopped. I think

33:00.933 --> 33:04.567
- they literally just broke it.
- What?

33:04.567 --> 33:06.533
- It just stopped.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

33:06.533 --> 33:09.767
- Is it broken already?
- Oh,.

33:09.767 --> 33:14.167
Oh, my God, you guys,
you guys.

33:14.167 --> 33:15.633
What happened with you
and Chyna?

33:15.633 --> 33:18.433
I was just like,
"Look, I'm done. I'm over it."

33:18.433 --> 33:20.967
- No.
- Yeah.

33:20.967 --> 33:23.267
All of us have been so
caught up with, like, all this

33:23.267 --> 33:25.400
Rob drama.
It's just overwhelming.

33:25.400 --> 33:29.067
I cried myself to sleep
for three years just praying he

33:29.067 --> 33:30.967
would feel and get better.

33:35.167 --> 33:37.800
It stopped. I think
they literally just broke it.

33:37.800 --> 33:41.033
- What?
- It just stopped.

33:41.033 --> 33:44.467
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Is it broken already?

33:44.467 --> 33:46.700
- Oh,.
- Oh, my God, you guys,

33:46.700 --> 33:49.600
- you guys.
- Is it our site or it's

33:49.600 --> 33:51.567
- Shopify's site?
- It's the site.

33:51.567 --> 33:53.467
- The site's down?
- Shopify...

33:53.467 --> 33:57.433
- Shopify can't get in.
- This is so stressful.

33:57.433 --> 33:59.600
Let's get Ryan on the
phone.

33:59.600 --> 34:02.200
Hey, Ryan.

34:02.200 --> 34:05.000
Um, I can't get into the back
end of the Shopify admin.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.967
- Can you?
- We're looking at that

34:06.967 --> 34:09.900
right now, but the site is open.
The I.T. guy, he says you'll be

34:09.900 --> 34:12.000
able to log in once we remove
the cache.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.767
- So they're doing it right now.
- Cash?

34:13.767 --> 34:15.233
I think they need to
clear theirs...

34:15.233 --> 34:16.767
Different "cache."
Okay.

34:16.767 --> 34:17.933
- Okay.
- Oh, my God...

34:17.933 --> 34:19.300
- You're up?
- I'm up over here.

34:19.300 --> 34:20.633
- Okay.
- So it hasn't crashed

34:20.633 --> 34:22.900
- yet?
- No.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.833
The customer's not
experiencing any problems.

34:24.833 --> 34:26.900
- It's just our end, Kris.
- Okay.

34:26.900 --> 34:28.733
- So we're selling product?
- Yeah.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.100
So almost 30,000 people
are on the site.

34:31.100 --> 34:33.300
- Amazing.
- What's it say on social?

34:33.300 --> 34:35.067
"Bam, bitches."
"Bam?"

34:35.067 --> 34:36.733
"Thank you for
improving the site.

34:36.733 --> 34:39.933
I got Posie and Koko easy.
It was such a pain last time."

34:39.933 --> 34:43.400
I just posted on

34:43.400 --> 34:47.567
- Twitter.
- Go get it, honey!

34:47.567 --> 34:51.467
- We're up over 70.
-  100,000.

34:51.467 --> 34:53.667
- Congratulations, Kylie.
- Yay, congratulations.

34:53.667 --> 34:56.100
Whoo!
Oh, now it's, now it's sold out.

34:56.100 --> 34:57.900
In less than 30
minutes.

34:57.900 --> 34:59.967
That was it.

34:59.967 --> 35:02.167
That is really-- it
makes me happy.

35:02.167 --> 35:05.367
- Congrats.
- Thank you.

35:05.367 --> 35:08.400
- You're welcome.
- This is just so...

35:08.400 --> 35:10.300
- exciting.
- Oh, my God, you're

35:10.300 --> 35:12.767
- gonna all cry!
- I'm so proud of you.

35:12.767 --> 35:16.100
Proud of you... my girl.

35:16.100 --> 35:19.333
I am so happy
everything went perfectly.

35:19.333 --> 35:22.967
The Web site didn't crash,
everybody's happy, except for

35:22.967 --> 35:26.133
the people that weren't able to
get it this time.

35:26.133 --> 35:30.500
But other than that, I'm just
focusing on the positive.

35:30.500 --> 35:35.300
Kylie, I think you've
just launched an empire.

35:35.300 --> 35:40.067
Congratulations, everybody.

35:40.067 --> 35:44.767
We kind of  rock!

35:54.533 --> 35:57.200
What kind of couch is
this?

35:57.200 --> 35:59.233
- There's, like, no back to it.
- I know.

35:59.233 --> 36:01.267
Well, there is if you take this
pillow away.

36:01.267 --> 36:03.600
What happened to your
couch that was comfortable?

36:03.600 --> 36:06.100
- I gave it away.
- Look, and then I can't

36:06.100 --> 36:07.933
even move my head back 'cause
there's no back support.

36:07.933 --> 36:10.233
Okay, well, I don't
know if you've noticed or not,

36:10.233 --> 36:13.233
but everybody moved out
of here, and I had to do

36:13.233 --> 36:18.100
something.

36:18.100 --> 36:21.600
Wait, Kylie and Chyna,
they were upstairs, Mom?

36:21.600 --> 36:23.500
Yeah.

36:25.633 --> 36:29.567
I'm just so confused.
Seeing this picture of Kylie and

36:29.567 --> 36:32.500
Chyna together, I legit thought
it was Photoshopped at first.

36:32.500 --> 36:34.900
I was like, "What am I looking
at right now?"

36:34.900 --> 36:37.600
Well, Rob came over to
have a talk.

36:37.600 --> 36:39.633
Why didn't you tell me
that?

36:39.633 --> 36:42.100
I haven't gotten a
chance to talk to you.

36:42.100 --> 36:44.167
Kylie and Blac Chyna?

36:48.400 --> 36:52.100
It feels so good to
have had the conversation with

36:52.100 --> 36:54.733
Rob and Chyna.
I said, "Look, I just want Rob

36:54.733 --> 36:57.767
to be joyful and happy and
productive and..."

36:57.767 --> 37:01.500
He goes, "Mom, I'm really happy.
This is what I want."

37:01.500 --> 37:04.100
So...
Just being with them and hearing

37:04.100 --> 37:09.500
what they had to say, and to see
how in love they are is...

37:09.500 --> 37:14.033
amazing.
He's a grown man, and he needs

37:14.033 --> 37:18.633
to make his own decisions, and I
need to let go a little bit.

37:22.733 --> 37:25.100
Did you forget to tell
me something?

37:25.100 --> 37:27.800
I just am seeing screen grabs

37:27.800 --> 37:30.000
from Twitter, and I'm like,
"What?"

37:30.000 --> 37:32.333
- This is crazy. How was it?
- Should I just tell you

37:32.333 --> 37:34.200
when you get here, the whole
story?

37:34.200 --> 37:36.067
- You are a beast.
- Let's talk when you

37:36.067 --> 37:38.167
- get here. I love you.
- M'kay. Love you, too.

37:38.167 --> 37:42.267
- Bye.
- It makes me so happy

37:42.267 --> 37:45.633
that Kylie was able to be so
mature and sit down with her

37:45.633 --> 37:49.833
brother and Chyna, and really
get some of the past issues

37:49.833 --> 37:52.167
talked about.
The next step, I think, is

37:52.167 --> 38:04.100
really for my other kids to
follow in Kylie's footsteps.

38:09.567 --> 38:14.833
- What's new, Khloe?
- Oh.

38:14.833 --> 38:17.933
Not much.
So tired.

38:17.933 --> 38:25.767
- But that's not new.
Uh-huh.

38:25.767 --> 38:27.900
Oh, what's new with
you?

38:27.900 --> 38:31.100
This is the
worst conversation, babe.

38:31.100 --> 38:33.733
- Who cares about small talk?
- Yeah, true.

38:33.733 --> 38:35.867
Make me so
uncomfortable.

38:35.867 --> 38:37.967
So, Kylie, are you
gonna tell us?

38:37.967 --> 38:39.667
- Yes.
- I need to hear what

38:39.667 --> 38:41.533
happened with you and Chyna
today.

38:41.533 --> 38:45.867
So,
pretty much, um, Rob called me

38:45.867 --> 38:49.300
about the whole situation, and I
was just like, "Look, I'm done.

38:49.300 --> 38:52.033
I'm over it."
And he was like, "Just come in

38:52.033 --> 38:54.200
for the meeting."
Her and Mom were going back and

38:54.200 --> 38:56.400
- forth for a while.
- Were they fighting or

38:56.400 --> 38:58.233
- they were fine?
- I mean, Mom was being

38:58.233 --> 39:01.633
- kind of like Mom.
- No.

39:01.633 --> 39:03.267
- Like, for sure.
- No.

39:03.267 --> 39:05.233
- Yeah.
- That's scary.

39:05.233 --> 39:07.533
She was like, "I don't
have a problem with you guys, I

39:07.533 --> 39:09.100
don't have a problem with any of
the sisters.

39:09.100 --> 39:11.000
I swear I didn't do this out of
spite.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.000
Like, it just happened."
This and that.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.967
And then her and I were talking
about, like, Tyga a lot, and,

39:15.967 --> 39:18.233
like, what went down in the
beginning, 'cause she was just

39:18.233 --> 39:20.267
like, "You know, he would still
text me."

39:20.267 --> 39:22.600
And I already knew that.
Like, T told me everything.

39:22.600 --> 39:26.500
Like, I saw all the text
messages, like, whatever.

39:26.500 --> 39:30.833
I do think I'm still working on
finding ways to let go of the

39:30.833 --> 39:35.600
things that people say about me.
So I just told Rob I want to

39:35.600 --> 39:39.567
talk to Chyna because there's so
much misunderstanding going on

39:39.567 --> 39:41.767
between her and I over social
media.

39:41.767 --> 39:45.067
We just talked a lot.
As I was talking to Chyna, she

39:45.067 --> 39:49.000
had as much to say to me as I
had to say to her, and I feel

39:49.000 --> 39:51.733
like a weight has just been
lifted off both of our

39:51.733 --> 39:54.133
shoulders.
And I feel like that's all we

39:54.133 --> 39:57.867
needed.
And then I was like, "We have to

39:57.867 --> 40:00.167
take a Snapchat so the world
knows."

40:00.167 --> 40:01.633
- You said that?
- Yeah.

40:01.633 --> 40:04.500
And then I just did the "We've
been best friends the whole

40:04.500 --> 40:05.800
time."
I swear, I thought

40:05.800 --> 40:07.700
- that was a Photoshop picture.
- Everyone did.

40:07.700 --> 40:13.100
So you guys are cool
now?

40:13.100 --> 40:17.333
- So that's that?
- Yeah.

40:17.333 --> 40:20.467
I think, at this point, we all
need to be one big happy family,

40:20.467 --> 40:22.800
'cause some things we just can't
control.

40:22.800 --> 40:26.300
Like other people's lives.
And honestly, I think you guys

40:26.300 --> 40:29.033
should talk.
It's like, people need to make

40:29.033 --> 40:30.767
up and get over things,
and, like...

40:30.767 --> 40:33.033
I'm just gonna start
minding my own business.

40:33.033 --> 40:35.600
No, because family is
family.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.100
I don't know why I
would have a sit-down with Chyna

40:38.100 --> 40:40.267
'cause I don't have any issues
with Chyna.

40:40.267 --> 40:43.500
I find it weird that Rob doesn't
think him and I should have a

40:43.500 --> 40:46.267
sit-down before anything else,
because that's where the issue

40:46.267 --> 40:49.367
is, is between Robert and
myself, and Rob can't just go

40:49.367 --> 40:51.733
into hiding.
I think the more space Rob

40:51.733 --> 40:54.500
leaves between us, it's...
it's not just gonna fix itself.

40:54.500 --> 40:57.767
Robert and I need to talk about
what happened, how did we get to

40:57.767 --> 41:00.433
this place, and how we could fix
it so we could never go back

41:00.433 --> 41:03.533
- here again.
- Who wants to have beef

41:03.533 --> 41:05.767
- with someone?
- I don't.

41:05.767 --> 41:07.667
- It's, like, tiring.
- I don't like having a

41:07.667 --> 41:09.533
- beef with anyone.
- Beef is not fun, you

41:09.533 --> 41:11.233
- know?
- I just don't like

41:11.233 --> 41:14.900
beef.
I haven't had beef in years.

41:14.900 --> 41:24.000
"I don't like
beef."

41:24.000 --> 41:26.933
Who shut the door?
Who shut the door?

41:26.933 --> 41:29.567
Did Kris Jenner do that to you?
Do you remember her?

41:29.567 --> 41:31.667
- You lived with her for a minute.
- Hi.

41:31.667 --> 41:34.300
Yeah, but is it the same dog?
Because Gabbana, I feel like,

41:34.300 --> 41:36.533
- was more gray.
- She's just happier, so

41:36.533 --> 41:39.633
- her hair turned dark.
- That's exactly why I

41:39.633 --> 41:43.033
went to the Maldives.
I wanted to be happier; I had

41:43.033 --> 41:45.633
- too much gray hair.
- How was it?

41:45.633 --> 41:47.967
It was really, really
fun.

41:47.967 --> 41:49.667
- We just, like, chilled.
- That's good.

41:49.667 --> 41:53.233
I just needed a minute,
because I just felt really

41:53.233 --> 41:56.000
overwhelmed, and I didn't want
to just come right back home

41:56.000 --> 41:59.900
before I took some time for
myself to breathe.

41:59.900 --> 42:02.267
Mm-hmm.
- And just digest

42:02.267 --> 42:06.767
everything that's been going on.
Especially after Vail.

42:06.767 --> 42:11.433
- Vail was a lot for me.
- I just think that all

42:11.433 --> 42:14.367
of us have been so caught up
with, like, all this Rob drama.

42:14.367 --> 42:17.767
- It's just overwhelming.
- You know, there's this

42:17.767 --> 42:22.400
huge part of me that just wants
him to be happy.

42:22.400 --> 42:26.067
Khloe and Rob have always been
two peas in a pod and best

42:26.067 --> 42:29.100
friends.
And it just breaks my heart that

42:29.100 --> 42:32.667
there's any divide between the
two of them whatsoever,

42:32.667 --> 42:34.567
especially over relationships.

42:36.667 --> 42:40.867
I think I cried myself to sleep
for three years just praying he

42:40.867 --> 42:46.400
would feel and get better.
I was telling Kourtney and Kim,

42:46.400 --> 42:50.267
it's like, wait till your kids
grow up and, you know, you face

42:50.267 --> 42:53.667
some real life challenges with
everyone, and then you realize

42:53.667 --> 42:59.333
what a mom really goes through.
Even when her kids are adults.

42:59.333 --> 43:03.167
The next step, I think, is
really for Khloe to hopefully

43:03.167 --> 43:07.400
have a great conversation with
Chyna and Rob, and I think that

43:07.400 --> 43:11.467
the more we all heal together
and bond together, the better

43:11.467 --> 43:13.800
life we're all gonna have.

43:18.033 --> 43:21.100
Coming up next week...
Kanye's shooting the video in

43:21.100 --> 43:23.433
- Iceland.
- This is unreal.

43:23.433 --> 43:25.433
Are you sad that
you're not with Kourt on her

43:25.433 --> 43:27.367
- birthday?
- Yeah, obviously.

43:27.367 --> 43:29.467
We need to go straight
to the video.

43:29.467 --> 43:31.467
We don't have time to go to the
hotel.

43:31.467 --> 43:33.733
I'm starting to freak out.
I'm not gonna make it to Kanye's

43:33.733 --> 43:36.367
shoot in time.
We may not make the video shoot.

43:36.367 --> 43:37.933
You should talk to
your sister.

43:37.933 --> 43:40.700
Whenever I talk to her,
it just leads to yelling at each

43:40.700 --> 43:44.067
- other.
- Look who I found.

43:44.067 --> 43:47.633
