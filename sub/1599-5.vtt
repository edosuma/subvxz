00:01.166 --> 00:03.134
<i>Sue sprung a surprise invitational</i>

00:03.168 --> 00:05.136
<i>on the New Directions and the
Warblers and Vocal Adrenaline,</i>

00:05.170 --> 00:07.138
<i>and Will's team got to go
first and they were amazing.</i>

00:07.172 --> 00:09.140
<i>Kind of hard to see how they could lose.</i>

00:09.174 --> 00:11.142
<i>Sue's a secret Klainer
and obsessed with getting.</i>

00:11.176 --> 00:13.144
<i>Kurt and Blaine back together,
except Blaine's dating Karofsky</i>

00:13.178 --> 00:16.146
<i>and Kurt went on a date with
a guy named Walter in his 50s.</i>

00:16.181 --> 00:18.149
How old are you
exactly?

00:18.183 --> 00:20.151
<i>Sue hypnotized Sam to
mess with Will and Rachel.</i>

00:20.185 --> 00:22.185
Oh, my God, I'm totally hypnotized.

00:22.187 --> 00:24.188
<i>And now Will and Rachel are, like,</i>

00:24.223 --> 00:26.190
<i>actual show choir enemies.</i>

00:26.224 --> 00:28.184
<i>And that's what you missed on Glee.</i>

00:34.834 --> 00:36.802
Vocal Adrenaline, everybody.

00:36.836 --> 00:39.271
Absolutely breathtaking, huh?

00:39.305 --> 00:41.907
I am here to inform all three teams

00:41.941 --> 00:44.142
that I, Sue Sylvester, will be judging

00:44.177 --> 00:47.245
this year's McKinley High
Show Choir Invitational.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.613
What? That's crazy.

00:48.648 --> 00:49.748
I run this school now.

00:49.782 --> 00:52.251
My school, my rules.

00:52.285 --> 00:54.252
And speaking of rules,
I would like to outline

00:54.287 --> 00:56.188
the rules for this year's invitational.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.522
Wait, Sue, you can't change the rules

00:57.557 --> 00:59.258
after one team has already performed.

00:59.292 --> 01:00.792
Sure I can. Rule number one:

01:00.827 --> 01:03.829
this year's theme is "old school."

01:03.863 --> 01:06.498
there are no more rules.

01:06.532 --> 01:09.301
The Dalton Academy Warblers
will perform tomorrow,

01:09.335 --> 01:12.271
and The New Directions will
perform the following day.

01:12.305 --> 01:14.373
Wait, this is a three-day competition?

01:14.407 --> 01:15.974
Where will we sleep?

01:16.009 --> 01:18.043
I imagine you two will
sleep inside one another.

01:18.077 --> 01:20.312
I've chosen to extend the invitational

01:20.346 --> 01:22.346
in an effort to give the
New Directions enough time

01:22.348 --> 01:25.017
to come up with the requisite 12 members,

01:25.051 --> 01:28.020
which is the only show
choir rule anyone remembers

01:28.054 --> 01:30.656
and yet every year is surprised by.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.858
This is insane. We should all boycott.

01:32.892 --> 01:35.127
Oh, no, no, no, Porcelain.
No, this is happening.

01:35.161 --> 01:38.664
Each team will perform
at this invitational.

01:38.698 --> 01:40.999
Even if one show choir's co-director is

01:41.034 --> 01:44.002
kidnapped and held against his will,

01:44.037 --> 01:47.706
causing him to miss the performance.

01:55.014 --> 01:57.015
- Mr. Schuester!
- Yes?

01:57.050 --> 01:59.017
We had a deal that you
would have Vocal Adrenaline

01:59.052 --> 02:01.253
perform at a subpar level, and
you dishonored that agreement.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.487
I never agreed to that.

02:02.522 --> 02:03.689
I guess you'll just have

02:03.723 --> 02:05.490
- to beat us on your own
terms. - You know what?

02:05.525 --> 02:08.227
We're just gonna find a
way to win on our own terms.

02:08.261 --> 02:10.095
Which is exactly what you just said.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.164
Wow, we have our work cut out for us.

02:12.198 --> 02:13.732
Vocal Adrenaline was amazing.

02:13.766 --> 02:15.601
We have two days. We have
to recruit more members

02:15.635 --> 02:17.169
and put together some sort of performance

02:17.203 --> 02:19.338
that doesn't totally
humiliate us as a team.

02:19.372 --> 02:21.273
Uh, I have an idea that
you are not gonna like,

02:21.307 --> 02:22.841
but you need to consider.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.710
We need to recruit Kitty.

02:24.744 --> 02:26.011
- No, Kurt! No!
- Rachel, come on.

02:26.045 --> 02:27.913
She's talented. She's a senior.

02:27.947 --> 02:29.948
- Kurt, she hates me.
- You don't know that.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.683
No, I do. All of those kids do, okay?

02:31.718 --> 02:33.385
I was so intent on being a Broadway star

02:33.420 --> 02:35.854
that I never even learned her
name, or any of their names.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.456
There was... there was Puck's brother

02:37.490 --> 02:39.691
and-and then there was
cross-dressing Mercedes

02:39.726 --> 02:42.261
and the one with the fat
mom and whatever... Raider.

02:42.295 --> 02:44.363
- Ryder.
- See? I was awful to them.

02:44.397 --> 02:46.131
Well, I'm sorry, Rachel.
We don't have a choice.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.533
We need to get Kitty.

02:47.567 --> 02:48.600
Don't worry. I'm gonna help you.

02:48.635 --> 02:49.635
I'll be right by your side

02:49.669 --> 02:51.670
every step of the way.

02:56.242 --> 02:57.976
You see that corner booth over there?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.779
Back in the '90s, a lady gave birth

03:00.814 --> 03:02.915
on that very table.

03:02.949 --> 03:05.384
I saw the whole damn thing.
She was just finishing up...

03:05.418 --> 03:07.820
<i>So I don't totally
know what's going on here.</i>

03:07.854 --> 03:09.988
<i>This is the second time
Walter and I have gone out.</i>

03:10.023 --> 03:11.490
<i>He's really funny and smart</i>

03:11.524 --> 03:13.058
<i>and very good looking for an older guy.</i>

03:13.093 --> 03:15.994
<i>But I can't tell if he
thinks this is a date or</i>

03:16.029 --> 03:17.129
<i>if we're just friends.</i>

03:17.163 --> 03:18.664
<i>Okay, Kurt,</i>

03:18.698 --> 03:20.766
<i>whatever you do, do not
just come out and ask him.</i>

03:20.800 --> 03:22.468
So what's going on here?

03:23.837 --> 03:25.270
<i>Would you consider this a date? Damn it!</i>

03:25.305 --> 03:26.672
Do you want it to be a date?

03:26.706 --> 03:29.641
Look, um, I had a lot of fun
the last time that we hung out,

03:29.676 --> 03:31.510
so... yes.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.612
To our second date.

03:33.646 --> 03:35.647
To our second date.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.851
Well, good evening, gentlemen.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.687
My name is Susan and I will
be taking care of you tonight.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.422
Shall we start with something to drink?

03:43.456 --> 03:46.925
Perhaps a Shirley Temple
in a sippy cup for sonny?

03:46.960 --> 03:49.094
Or how about a chalky can of Ensure,

03:49.129 --> 03:52.931
enriched with calcium to
fortify those brittle bones?

03:52.966 --> 03:55.668
Now, is your great-grand uncle

03:55.702 --> 03:59.171
in charge of his faculties or
are you going to be feeding him?

03:59.205 --> 04:01.440
Because I'll just need
to alert the bus staff

04:01.474 --> 04:03.475
that I might be changing an adult diaper.

04:03.510 --> 04:06.445
Excuse me. I can hear
everything you're saying.

04:06.479 --> 04:08.447
Well, then allow me to personally

04:08.481 --> 04:10.950
thank you for being part
of the greatest generation.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.118
All right.

04:13.153 --> 04:15.454
Here's a children's menu for baby.

04:15.488 --> 04:18.190
And the early bird menu for old timers.

04:18.224 --> 04:20.959
And, yes, of course, we
have liver and onions.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.529
I am so, so sorry.

04:23.563 --> 04:26.799
Why? I think this woman is hilarious.

04:26.833 --> 04:29.568
And you have to understand,
when you're as handsome as I am,

04:29.603 --> 04:30.803
very little bothers you.

04:30.837 --> 04:33.405
And by the way, ma'am,

04:33.440 --> 04:35.374
just how old are you?

04:36.409 --> 04:38.344
Thirty-four.

04:38.378 --> 04:40.246
Ah.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.382
I will be right back with
your hemorrhoid pillow.

04:45.919 --> 04:47.119
To our second date.

04:49.523 --> 04:52.424
I'm gonna show you something.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:01.902 --> 05:05.871
Oh, Becky, this is Klaine.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.907
And theirs is a love for the ages.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.276
But, Coach,

05:10.310 --> 05:12.444
they're barely looking at each other.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.914
Well, that's because their
chemistry is so intense, Becky,

05:14.948 --> 05:17.516
if they were actually
to make eye contact...

05:17.551 --> 05:19.585
Oh, my... the emotion would be such

05:19.619 --> 05:21.387
they'd have to disappear
behind the nearest Dumpster

05:21.421 --> 05:23.622
and just hump, hump, hump, hump, hump.

05:23.657 --> 05:26.459
Where did you get all these video clips?

05:26.493 --> 05:28.427
I have cameras everywhere, Becky.

05:28.462 --> 05:31.096
But is this, like, a dream sequence?

05:31.131 --> 05:32.798
How could you film that?

05:32.833 --> 05:35.301
Okay, Becky, shut up.
You're ruining this, honey.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.304
But it looks like they
don't even like each other.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.772
Sweet, simple, Becky,

05:39.806 --> 05:42.741
you have so much to learn about love.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.276
What are you talking about?

05:44.311 --> 05:46.378
I have a hot boyfriend.

05:46.413 --> 05:48.147
Look at them, Becky.

05:48.181 --> 05:51.784
Have there ever been two human beings

05:51.818 --> 05:53.919
more meant for each other? Oh.

05:53.954 --> 05:57.823
And yet somehow, hackneyed circumstance and

05:57.858 --> 06:00.626
a pudgy ex-bully have
somehow gotten between them.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.128
I need to get these two

06:02.162 --> 06:04.764
into a small, confined space

06:04.798 --> 06:08.734
where they're forced to
gaze into each other's eyes.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.604
And then, Becky,

06:11.638 --> 06:13.139
then

06:13.173 --> 06:17.810
the stinky frottage will commence.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.180
Hey!

06:21.214 --> 06:22.848
Your name is Kitty Wilde.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.750
You were named after a
Bruce Springsteen song.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.505
You don't trust newspapers
because you think

06:26.520 --> 06:28.187
that they lied about Watergate.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.289
You once beat up a mascot at
a little league softball game

06:30.323 --> 06:31.757
for trying to start the wave with everyone.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.626
You say that your favorite color is Jesus.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.261
Oh, you prefer Triscuits over Wheat Thins.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.695
And sometimes you don't wear underwear.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.330
But I got that last one from Artie, so...

06:38.365 --> 06:40.032
Are you trying to pick me
up? Because if you're gonna

06:40.067 --> 06:41.767
go lezzy with a cheerleader,
I think the world's kind of

06:41.802 --> 06:42.935
rooting for you and Quinn Fabray.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.370
I just want you to know

06:44.404 --> 06:46.038
that I've taken some
time to get to know you,

06:46.073 --> 06:48.174
and that who you are is important to me.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.542
So that I don't feel like I'm being used

06:49.576 --> 06:50.976
when you ask me to join the Glee Club?

06:51.011 --> 06:53.679
- Pretty much.
- Look, Rachel.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.982
You have a reputation for being
an inherently selfish person.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.818
You rarely ask people what they think,

06:58.852 --> 07:01.020
and when you do, it's
usually in the context of.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.321
"What do you think about me?"

07:02.356 --> 07:03.856
I took a chance and joined.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.825
Mr. Schuester's Glee Club because

07:05.859 --> 07:07.893
I knew that even though
it was gonna hurt my rep

07:07.928 --> 07:10.396
that it was being led
by a kind man committed

07:10.430 --> 07:13.232
to teaching and that there
were a bunch of kids in there

07:13.266 --> 07:15.386
that would have my back
when things got hairy.

07:15.402 --> 07:16.535
Now, what's there?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.204
A chubber, a transfer student

07:18.238 --> 07:20.539
and a Bizarro Jaime and Cersei Lannister,

07:20.574 --> 07:23.054
and an advisor who's
gonna jump ship as soon

07:23.076 --> 07:25.711
as the real world invites
her back to the stage.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.380
No, thanks.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.484
Kitty, we need you.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.219
All right? Your energy, your enthusiasm.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.920
I don't know you very well,

07:34.955 --> 07:37.890
but I know that you love performing.

07:39.926 --> 07:41.527
I did.

07:41.561 --> 07:44.230
I did love it.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.098
You can sing, you can dance.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.167
And-and, yes, Santana's cruelty

07:48.201 --> 07:50.169
definitely scarred me
for the rest of my life,

07:50.203 --> 07:52.738
but I know that the Glee
Club needs a top bitch

07:52.773 --> 07:54.173
to keep everyone in line.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.709
I invested everything into Glee Club.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.878
And what did it get me?

07:58.912 --> 08:00.513
They all deserted me.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.581
The only reason I'm still here is

08:02.616 --> 08:04.784
because Sue needed me for Cheerios!

08:04.818 --> 08:07.298
I miss singing and dancing

08:07.321 --> 08:10.122
and the feeling of being in the choir room.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.091
But I know Sue...

08:12.125 --> 08:13.859
and I know you.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.462
And I don't want to jump back
in just to have my heart broken

08:16.496 --> 08:19.016
again in a couple weeks
when it all goes away.

08:20.467 --> 08:22.768
Look.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.704
This is real.

08:24.738 --> 08:28.074
Okay? I'm not going anywhere
until my job here is done

08:28.108 --> 08:31.077
and the Glee Club is back
at McKinley permanently.

08:32.578 --> 08:34.080
Look, you have my word.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.881
You come back,

08:35.916 --> 08:37.984
and we'll see this through together.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.657
Oh, I'm sorry. Hi! Oh! Hi. Hi.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.891
I thought you'd be in the auditorium.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.126
The Warblers are about to go on.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.061
No, no. I know. I-I just, um...

08:49.096 --> 08:51.597
I've always wanted to use
the McKinley faculty bathroom

08:51.632 --> 08:54.066
now that I'm sort of faculty myself.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.101
Oh, so how was it?

08:55.102 --> 08:57.169
It felt really grown up.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.337
Oh, well, I'm headed back now.

08:58.372 --> 08:59.492
Do you want to walk with me?

08:59.506 --> 09:01.307
Yeah, that be nice.

09:02.442 --> 09:03.576
Oh, hey.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.244
- Is that new?
- Oh, yeah.

09:05.279 --> 09:07.513
I guess so. That's convenient.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.782
Yeah, sure, they get an elevator
after I already graduate, so...

09:09.816 --> 09:11.584
All those years of carrying up
all those stairs. Such a drag.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.319
Were you here when we had to
fight for that ramp outside?

09:13.353 --> 09:15.021
Oh, I know. That was weird, too.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.990
You excited to watch the Warblers perform?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.358
I am. They're really good.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.260
- How are the New Directions?
- Oh, you know.

09:21.295 --> 09:22.461
They'll get there.

09:22.496 --> 09:24.096
What a weird elevator.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.499
Oh, my God, look, is this
a... is this a bathroom?

09:26.533 --> 09:27.667
In an elevator?

09:28.835 --> 09:31.671
I don't think we're moving.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.373
Just press...

09:34.408 --> 09:35.508
The doors... the doors aren't opening.

09:35.542 --> 09:36.509
- No, press the buttons.
- They're not...

09:36.543 --> 09:37.510
Just press the emergency thing.

09:37.544 --> 09:38.811
Hello? Hello?

09:38.845 --> 09:40.813
It should make a buzzing noise.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.849
- Hello? Hello?
- Hi!

09:42.883 --> 09:45.017
Let's pry it open. Let's just do one

09:45.052 --> 09:47.220
at the same... at one time.  Ow!

09:48.322 --> 09:51.457
I think we're locked in.

09:51.491 --> 09:54.026
What kind of elevator is this?

09:58.432 --> 10:01.234
I don't think this is a real elevator.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.673
- Hey, where's Kurt?
- I have no idea!

10:06.707 --> 10:09.576
He's not answering any of my
calls or texts or anything.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.977
Oh, my goodness. I
have just been informed

10:11.011 --> 10:13.313
by the head Warbler...
Whose name is Tristan

10:13.347 --> 10:16.649
or Crispin or Montague or-or
something annoyingly fay...

10:16.684 --> 10:19.252
That their coach is currently missing.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.721
Which, of course, is a shock to all of us.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.691
Blaine, our hopes and prayers are with you.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.594
But the show must go on.

10:27.628 --> 10:31.097
Ladies and lady boys, I give you

12:49.403 --> 12:51.171
Geez! Gosh, you scared me.

12:52.106 --> 12:54.040
How did you even...

12:54.074 --> 12:56.309
And I'm already hypnotized.

12:56.343 --> 12:58.811
Excellent.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.814
I need you to listen to me carefully.

13:00.848 --> 13:02.182
Operation Break Rachel's Heart.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.683
While Sabotaging the New Directions

13:03.717 --> 13:05.485
is proceeding very nicely.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.720
Have you thought about using a
shorter name for the operation?

13:07.755 --> 13:09.989
Your next objective is
to convince the glee club

13:10.024 --> 13:12.392
to perform these three musical numbers

13:12.426 --> 13:13.993
at the invitational tomorrow.

13:14.028 --> 13:15.161
It'll be

13:15.196 --> 13:16.596
the worst glee club set list

13:16.630 --> 13:18.665
in human history.

13:18.699 --> 13:21.067
Song number one:

13:21.101 --> 13:24.170
"Ascension Millennium" by Corey Feldman.

13:24.205 --> 13:25.338
I don't know

13:25.372 --> 13:27.006
why Corey Feldman is writing songs.

13:27.041 --> 13:29.342
I don't know why he wrote
this particular song.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.946
All I know is that the
first time I heard this song,

13:32.980 --> 13:34.714
I literally could not move.

13:34.748 --> 13:36.783
Song number two:

13:36.817 --> 13:39.185
"Dear Mr. Jesus,"

13:39.220 --> 13:41.087
a song about the horrors of child abuse

13:41.121 --> 13:43.623
that actually makes you want
to go out and locate a child

13:43.657 --> 13:45.458
for the express purpose of beating him up.

13:45.492 --> 13:46.626
And the third

13:46.660 --> 13:49.596
and final song in the
worst glee club set list

13:49.630 --> 13:51.364
of all time:

13:51.398 --> 13:55.068
Tammy Wynette and KLF's...

13:55.102 --> 13:57.136
"Justified and Ancient."

13:57.171 --> 13:59.606
Hands down, the worst song ever written.

13:59.640 --> 14:00.807
Got it.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.609
Outstanding.

14:02.643 --> 14:04.643
Hello, Officer, yes, I would like to file

14:04.645 --> 14:06.079
a missing persons report.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.447
Um, my friend, Kurt Hummel,

14:07.481 --> 14:09.048
he didn't show up for work today.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.984
My name is Rachel Berry.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.286
Yes, that was my TV show.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.889
Yes, I've taken acting classes before.

14:15.923 --> 14:19.425
You know what, sir, that
is very rude of you, and...

14:19.460 --> 14:22.095
Hello? Hello?

14:25.366 --> 14:26.833
Sam, hey, uh, have you heard

14:26.867 --> 14:28.468
- from Kurt or Blaine at all?
- Relax, they're

14:28.502 --> 14:30.303
probably at Sheets N' Things
registering for their wedding.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.071
No, they're just friends now.

14:32.106 --> 14:34.007
No, they're endgame like
us, and to prove my love,

14:34.041 --> 14:36.609
I am going to guarantee you
an invitational championship.

14:36.644 --> 14:37.744
Boom, you're welcome.

14:37.778 --> 14:39.078
"Justified and Ancient,."

14:39.113 --> 14:40.113
"Ascension Millennium,."

14:40.114 --> 14:41.915
"Dear Mr. Jesus."

14:41.949 --> 14:44.317
- Sam, I don't, I don't know any
of these songs. - Oh, you will.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.752
And as your future husband,
I demand that you do them.

14:45.786 --> 14:47.754
- Oh, God, you're hot.
- Wait, wait.

14:47.788 --> 14:49.455
What's wrong with you?

14:49.490 --> 14:50.456
I'm crazy in love with you.

14:50.491 --> 14:52.025
Sam, you told me two days ago

14:52.059 --> 14:53.493
that you were in love with Mercedes.

14:53.527 --> 14:54.527
That old hag?

14:54.528 --> 14:57.831
Sam! No, look, I just... I'm sorry.

14:57.865 --> 15:00.266
Look, it feels really good to
have a guy be into me right now,

15:00.301 --> 15:02.368
but I just, I have so much going on.

15:02.403 --> 15:03.937
I need my friends, and honestly

15:03.971 --> 15:05.731
you're starting to freak
me out a little bit.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.475
Okay, I-I'm really sorry.

15:08.509 --> 15:11.144
I don't really understand what's
been going on with me lately.

15:11.178 --> 15:14.113
I just have these big gaps in my memory.

15:14.148 --> 15:15.648
Like, even bigger than normal.

15:15.683 --> 15:17.217
Okay, look, I promise

15:17.251 --> 15:19.118
none of that will happen again.
Whatever you want me to do,

15:19.153 --> 15:20.353
uh, just let me know. I'm here.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.055
Well, can you help me find Kurt?

15:22.089 --> 15:24.023
And, oh, if you really want
to get in my good graces,

15:24.058 --> 15:25.658
then you can help me find seven new members

15:25.693 --> 15:27.193
for the glee club. All right, I'm on it.

15:27.228 --> 15:28.461
Oh, and, Sam, I'm sorry,

15:28.496 --> 15:29.896
I-I'm not gonna use these.

15:29.930 --> 15:32.365
Might be a huge mistake,

15:32.399 --> 15:34.519
but I have to start
trusting my own instincts.

15:41.261 --> 15:42.962
Stop banging!

15:42.996 --> 15:45.364
No one can hear you.

15:45.399 --> 15:46.759
Well, why don't you use your phone?

15:46.767 --> 15:48.100
I'm at four percent.

15:48.135 --> 15:50.269
It just died.

15:50.304 --> 15:52.071
You got to stop charging every night.

15:52.105 --> 15:53.439
I've told you a hundred times.

15:53.473 --> 15:55.408
There's no reception in here anyway.

15:57.945 --> 15:59.979
Well, at least
we got that bathroom.

16:00.013 --> 16:01.414
God, I am losing my mind.

16:01.448 --> 16:03.368
We've got to find a way out of here.

16:09.990 --> 16:10.990
Yeah, I don't...

16:16.196 --> 16:17.897
Hello, Klaine.

16:17.931 --> 16:18.998
Let's play a game.

16:19.032 --> 16:21.467
You're trapped in an elevator.

16:21.502 --> 16:22.602
This isn't an elevator.

16:22.636 --> 16:24.137
You're trapped in an elevator

16:24.171 --> 16:25.271
with a bathroom.

16:25.305 --> 16:27.006
If you don't find a way out,

16:27.040 --> 16:28.741
you'll be forced to eat each other

16:28.775 --> 16:31.277
and then suffocate.

16:31.311 --> 16:33.479
But you have another choice.

16:33.514 --> 16:34.313
What?

16:34.348 --> 16:36.616
You and Blaine must kiss.

16:36.650 --> 16:38.017
If you kiss each other,

16:38.051 --> 16:39.919
you will be allowed to leave this room.

16:39.953 --> 16:41.154
That's ridiculous.

16:41.188 --> 16:42.288
That's easy.

16:42.322 --> 16:43.422
That's all we got to do?

16:43.457 --> 16:45.591
Okay. Here we go.

16:45.626 --> 16:47.126
Here we go. Blaine and I
are about to kiss. Ready?

16:47.161 --> 16:48.161
There.

16:48.162 --> 16:49.629
No, not like that.

16:49.663 --> 16:52.331
I want to see you really go at it.

16:52.366 --> 16:53.833
Just let us out, please!

16:53.867 --> 16:55.501
Just, no. We're not gonna do that.

16:55.536 --> 16:57.770
Fine, be that way.

16:57.805 --> 16:59.772
You're in for a long night,

16:59.807 --> 17:02.108
as the temperature of this
elevator with a bathroom

17:02.142 --> 17:04.877
rises and rises, and you'll be forced

17:04.912 --> 17:07.780
to remove more and more clothes.

17:09.082 --> 17:10.183
This is insane.

17:12.152 --> 17:14.820
How will you resist each other?

17:14.855 --> 17:17.356
Scantily clad, burning with desire,

17:17.391 --> 17:19.959
enjoying a romantic dinner for two

17:19.992 --> 17:23.463
of roasted corn salad
and seared lamb tapenade,

17:23.497 --> 17:26.999
paired perfectly with a bottle
of playful, full-bodied Cabernet

17:27.034 --> 17:29.669
with just the right amount of spice.

17:34.174 --> 17:37.677
Don't fight the Klaine romance.

17:37.711 --> 17:39.345
The choice is yours.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.550
Come on, no! Come on!

17:45.552 --> 17:46.919
Come on!

17:48.389 --> 17:50.256
We are not gonna...

17:50.290 --> 17:52.050
- kiss for your amusement.
- Oh, God.

17:52.059 --> 17:54.594
What's in this?

17:56.063 --> 17:57.363
Oh. Oh, that's...

17:57.398 --> 17:59.799
Oh, this is a fun one.

18:01.802 --> 18:03.536
Okay, fine.

18:03.570 --> 18:04.904
I'm in.

18:04.938 --> 18:06.572
Oh, my God, amazing.

18:08.776 --> 18:10.910
- Where is everybody?
- Oh, I called everyone

18:10.944 --> 18:12.879
and pushed glee rehearsal for an
hour because I'm still trying...

18:12.913 --> 18:14.047
To come up with a set list

18:14.081 --> 18:15.214
for a performance you're giving tomorrow?

18:15.249 --> 18:16.549
That's so Mr. Shue.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.018
I can't decide if that's sad or adorable.

18:19.053 --> 18:20.286
The answer is adorable.

18:20.320 --> 18:21.788
It's just that Sue is judging,

18:21.822 --> 18:23.523
and if she wasn't, then I'd have it,

18:23.557 --> 18:25.124
but I know she's gonna
hate anything that I pick.

18:25.159 --> 18:26.526
I know.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.194
You know what song she'd like?

18:28.228 --> 18:31.030
No, but I know where to find them.

18:31.065 --> 18:33.299
I probably shouldn't
be letting you do this,

18:33.333 --> 18:34.734
being that you're a student and all.

18:34.768 --> 18:36.703
Plus, we're probably being recorded.

18:36.737 --> 18:39.138
No, I already cut the main
line to the security cameras

18:39.173 --> 18:40.540
and the alarm.

18:40.574 --> 18:42.108
<i>Look, I may not have lived</i>

18:42.142 --> 18:44.744
in some vague outer
borough of New York City,

18:44.778 --> 18:46.646
but there's a reason I'm the only glee kid

18:46.680 --> 18:49.082
who survived Sue Sylvester's
regime at McKinley.

18:49.116 --> 18:51.117
Because I'm ruthless, too.

18:51.151 --> 18:52.618
Wait, how do you know her password?

18:54.488 --> 18:57.090
I bribed Becky with a box
of smuggled Mexican Twinkies.

18:57.124 --> 18:59.592
<i>She's got a thing for
third-world snack cakes</i>

18:59.626 --> 19:02.562
<i>made with real sugar and animal shortening.</i>

19:02.596 --> 19:04.764
I don't want to know

19:04.798 --> 19:07.467
what ThunderBolton69 means,

19:07.501 --> 19:08.968
but she hasn't changed it in years.

19:09.003 --> 19:10.937
Okay, so what exactly are we looking for?

19:10.971 --> 19:12.605
Sue has a secret playlist

19:12.640 --> 19:15.908
of songs that she's so
emotionally vulnerable to

19:15.943 --> 19:17.243
that they're hidden

19:17.278 --> 19:19.646
in an encrypted, password-protected folder

19:19.680 --> 19:20.980
only she can access.

19:21.015 --> 19:22.935
Wait, how do you have that password?

19:24.051 --> 19:26.352
<i>Nicaraguan Ding-Dongs.</i>

19:27.388 --> 19:28.921
Take a look

19:28.956 --> 19:30.690
at these.

19:38.365 --> 19:40.600
Dude, it's almost 9:00.

19:40.634 --> 19:42.268
Wow, that is some serious commitment.

19:42.303 --> 19:44.437
Well, now that Beiste
is gone and you're coach,

19:44.471 --> 19:45.939
I assumed I'm gonna be starting QB.

19:45.973 --> 19:47.340
So I got to be ready, right?

19:47.374 --> 19:51.311
Yeah, um, actually, I kind of...

19:51.345 --> 19:53.713
changed my mind about that.

19:53.747 --> 19:55.281
What?

19:55.316 --> 19:56.783
What are you talking about, man?

19:56.817 --> 19:58.518
You told me that I was gonna be starting.

19:58.552 --> 20:00.553
Well, you know, you got
the arm for it, but, uh,

20:00.588 --> 20:02.188
quarterbacks are leaders, not cowards.

20:03.490 --> 20:04.891
Are you calling me a wussy?

20:04.925 --> 20:08.027
Yes, I am, actually. I
am calling you a wussy.

20:08.062 --> 20:10.830
You don't think I've noticed
you skulking around the glee club

20:10.865 --> 20:12.966
or I haven't seen you
coincidentally reading a book

20:13.000 --> 20:14.634
just outside the choir
room during rehearsal?

20:14.668 --> 20:16.302
I'm walking a tightrope, man.

20:16.337 --> 20:17.871
I've got no wiggle room.

20:17.905 --> 20:21.407
I got to be tougher,
stronger and more manly

20:21.442 --> 20:23.076
than everyone else on the team

20:23.110 --> 20:26.179
because if they smell even
a little bit of gay on me,

20:26.213 --> 20:27.580
I'm not their teammate anymore.

20:27.615 --> 20:29.315
I'm just another homo.

20:29.350 --> 20:31.184
Dude, that's not true,
okay? Times have changed.

20:31.218 --> 20:35.154
If I join the glee club,
everything I worked so hard for,

20:35.189 --> 20:36.422
it's ruined.

20:36.457 --> 20:38.691
But you want to join.

20:38.726 --> 20:40.326
Of course I do.

20:40.361 --> 20:42.929
I'm a freakin' rock star, man.

20:42.963 --> 20:43.897
All right.

20:43.931 --> 20:45.999
But I'm stuck

20:46.033 --> 20:48.234
singing and dancing alone in my bedroom,

20:48.269 --> 20:51.104
because I don't want anyone
to think that I'm gay.

20:53.107 --> 20:54.841
Look, man.

20:56.744 --> 20:59.012
Every movement needs a
leader, someone to step out

20:59.046 --> 21:00.680
in the light and say, "Hey, this is me.

21:00.714 --> 21:02.615
This is who I am, and
this is what I stand for."

21:02.650 --> 21:04.384
Look, I get it.

21:04.418 --> 21:05.518
High school is tough.

21:05.553 --> 21:06.686
But you can do this.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.688
And they...

21:08.722 --> 21:11.925
they will lose their judgment
as soon as you lose yours.

21:11.959 --> 21:13.159
I got your back here, dude.

21:14.094 --> 21:15.528
And that guy right there,

21:15.563 --> 21:18.264
Finn, was one of my best friends,

21:18.299 --> 21:19.365
and he was

21:19.400 --> 21:21.801
the quarterback here.

21:21.836 --> 21:23.703
And when he joined the glee club,

21:23.737 --> 21:26.573
it changed everything here forever.

21:27.975 --> 21:30.710
Pick up where he left off,

21:30.745 --> 21:32.979
and it'll be the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

21:39.213 --> 21:42.381
I thought you said you'd
never join the glee club again.

21:42.416 --> 21:44.896
Well, someone has to stop you
from marrying your brother.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.689
Oh, uh, Rachel, there's a
policeman in your office.

21:49.723 --> 21:51.791
Finally.

21:53.227 --> 21:54.861
Thank you so much for coming.
My friends are missing...

21:54.895 --> 21:55.895
What are you doing?

21:55.896 --> 21:57.363
You're gonna have to speak up.

21:57.397 --> 21:58.698
I got a bum ear. Scarlet fever.

21:58.732 --> 22:00.133
I know you.

22:00.167 --> 22:01.134
You're the Deaf Choir coach.

22:01.168 --> 22:02.568
<i>Was the Deaf Choir coach.</i>

22:02.603 --> 22:04.270
Oh, yeah, our funding got cut! Again.

22:04.304 --> 22:05.605
And maybe my kids

22:05.639 --> 22:07.874
don't always sing on
key or stay on the beat,

22:07.908 --> 22:09.208
but they got a song in their heart,

22:09.243 --> 22:10.309
and that's worth more
than all the tea in China.

22:10.344 --> 22:12.411
I guarantee you, we will be back.

22:12.446 --> 22:13.646
- Okay.
- But right now,

22:13.680 --> 22:15.314
I got to make a living,

22:15.349 --> 22:16.983
so I'm a part-time cop,

22:17.017 --> 22:18.418
part-time mixed martial arts instructor.

22:18.452 --> 22:19.752
I hear your friends are missing.

22:19.787 --> 22:21.654
What are you doing?

22:21.688 --> 22:24.323
Uh, I'm sorry, we're looking
for my friends Kurt and Blaine.

22:24.358 --> 22:26.759
First we got to find Kurt
Hummel and Blaine Anderson.

22:26.794 --> 22:30.063
I'm-I'm so sorry. I'm just
really worried about my friends.

22:30.097 --> 22:31.964
You're probably worried about them,

22:31.999 --> 22:34.434
but I wouldn't if I were
you, because ten to one,

22:34.468 --> 22:36.002
they've eloped to New
York where they belong.

22:36.036 --> 22:37.636
You don't belong there; you're a quitter.

22:37.638 --> 22:40.139
You quit Broadway, you
did that horrible TV show.

22:40.174 --> 22:41.607
You get what you deserve, sister.

22:41.642 --> 22:44.077
And that Karofsky fellow... ugh.

22:44.111 --> 22:45.831
There's no way Blaine
is ending up with him.

22:45.846 --> 22:48.581
That hairy sack of crap, one
time, cut me off at a light

22:48.615 --> 22:50.116
- and gave me the finger.
- I'm sor...

22:50.150 --> 22:51.951
Once a bully, always a bully, I say.

22:51.985 --> 22:53.252
I wouldn't be the least bit surprised

22:53.287 --> 22:54.620
if he kidnapped them.

22:54.655 --> 22:56.122
Wait a minute.

22:57.057 --> 22:59.525
Maybe it was you.

22:59.560 --> 23:03.096
Funny Girl comes right back
to town, gets jealous of

23:03.130 --> 23:04.664
- her more talented friends...
- What?

23:04.698 --> 23:05.998
...so she chops them up

23:06.033 --> 23:07.767
into little bits... Okay...

23:07.801 --> 23:09.168
...puts them on her Hibachi
and feeds them to the new kids,

23:09.203 --> 23:10.203
'cause they're so naive

23:10.204 --> 23:12.004
they'd do anything you asked.

23:12.039 --> 23:13.940
- All right, I get it.
- Uh-huh. You get a lawyer.

23:13.974 --> 23:15.334
I'll do that. Don't you leave town.

23:15.342 --> 23:16.976
Okay.

23:17.010 --> 23:19.846
Uh, why don't we just do what we rehearsed?

23:19.880 --> 23:23.049
The-the Bruno Mars set
list was too predictable.

23:23.083 --> 23:24.784
These songs are more unassuming.

23:24.818 --> 23:26.652
They create an emotional resonance.

23:26.687 --> 23:28.154
Um, no disrespect,

23:28.188 --> 23:29.489
but we don't have time for a weekly lesson.

23:29.523 --> 23:30.623
Roderick is right.

23:30.657 --> 23:33.126
Maybe we should just
stick to our original plan.

23:33.160 --> 23:35.561
Or we could shut our traps
and trust our teacher.

23:35.596 --> 23:37.130
Because, the last time I checked,

23:37.164 --> 23:39.499
Rachel Berry has more
talent in her little finger

23:39.533 --> 23:42.168
than anyone in this stinkin', rotten town.

23:45.773 --> 23:49.375
Look, I'm gonna be
perfectly honest with you.

23:49.410 --> 23:51.377
Sue Sylvester hates me.

23:51.412 --> 23:52.979
She always has.

23:53.013 --> 23:54.714
And now she hates you guys

23:54.748 --> 23:56.516
for joining the only club in the school

23:56.550 --> 23:58.418
that she can't control.

23:58.452 --> 24:03.022
But it's not about winning a competition.

24:03.057 --> 24:05.825
It's about being able
to walk down the hallway

24:05.859 --> 24:09.162
and-and face Sue Sylvester...
Or any Sue Sylvester

24:09.196 --> 24:11.097
that you meet for the rest of your life

24:11.131 --> 24:13.232
and-and show them that
we may not always win,

24:13.267 --> 24:15.347
but we're not gonna go
down without a fight.

24:16.203 --> 24:17.570
So if you guys want to quit,

24:17.604 --> 24:18.838
now is the time.

24:18.872 --> 24:19.906
You'll probably have

24:19.940 --> 24:21.007
an easier experience

24:21.041 --> 24:22.608
at this school if you do.

24:22.643 --> 24:25.678
But if you don't want to,

24:25.713 --> 24:27.680
then we'll just stay here

24:27.715 --> 24:29.682
and-and we'll work super hard

24:29.717 --> 24:31.684
and put our noses to the grindstone

24:31.719 --> 24:33.519
and we might even have
to pull an all-nighter.

24:33.554 --> 24:35.088
An all-nighter?

24:35.122 --> 24:36.456
That's amazing!

24:37.825 --> 24:39.692
Yeah, and we can order pizza

24:39.727 --> 24:41.461
and root beer and have, like, a party.

24:41.495 --> 24:44.030
I'm s... Are-are you joining us?

24:44.064 --> 24:45.298
You want to win, don't you?

24:45.332 --> 24:47.367
Yes! Yes!

24:47.401 --> 24:48.641
Yes, we do!

25:03.751 --> 25:06.231
No, it's-it's
the to-go breadsticks.

25:06.253 --> 25:07.487
We're definitely not gonna kiss later,

25:07.521 --> 25:08.788
'cause I just had, like, a ton of...

25:08.822 --> 25:09.956
Now one, two, three, go.

25:09.990 --> 25:11.124
Yes, okay, I know.

25:11.158 --> 25:12.125
On three. On three means...

25:12.159 --> 25:14.327
One, two, three. Go.

25:29.610 --> 25:31.444
I'll be right back.

25:31.478 --> 25:33.012
Hey.

25:33.047 --> 25:35.087
Look, Rachel, I get that you're mad at me,

25:35.115 --> 25:36.649
but I have a job to do,

25:36.684 --> 25:37.784
and that's coaching Vocal Adrenaline.

25:37.818 --> 25:39.652
I'm sorry.

25:39.687 --> 25:41.087
I was totally out of line.

25:41.121 --> 25:42.188
You were right.

25:42.222 --> 25:43.523
You were just doing your job...

25:43.557 --> 25:45.258
Which, by the way, is a lot harder

25:45.292 --> 25:46.693
than you made it out to be

25:46.727 --> 25:48.194
when you were teaching us.

25:48.228 --> 25:49.662
I know I'm not your student anymore,

25:49.697 --> 25:51.097
but you taught me

25:51.131 --> 25:52.699
a very important lesson in being a teacher,

25:52.733 --> 25:55.201
which is that you have to
be devoted to your kids.

25:55.235 --> 25:57.270
Well, between you and me, it's a lot harder

25:57.304 --> 25:59.505
to be devoted to kids I
don't particularly like.

25:59.540 --> 26:00.840
Sorry.

26:00.874 --> 26:03.176
How are your kids doing?
Are they... they ready?

26:03.210 --> 26:04.978
They're good. Actually, I'm kind of dying.

26:05.012 --> 26:07.347
I just... I want them to be so good.

26:07.381 --> 26:08.715
I-I don't know. It's weird.

26:08.749 --> 26:09.949
I want this part to be over with.

26:09.984 --> 26:11.484
No, no, no. No.

26:11.518 --> 26:13.119
Enjoy this.

26:13.153 --> 26:14.854
Enjoy the beginning and
the not knowing and the...

26:14.888 --> 26:16.222
and the first steps with them.

26:16.256 --> 26:17.496
Because one day,

26:17.524 --> 26:18.558
years from now,

26:18.592 --> 26:20.026
you'll be talking to one of them

26:20.060 --> 26:21.894
and you'll be amazed by the
man or woman they've become.

26:21.929 --> 26:24.163
- Thanks, Mr. Shue.
- Yeah.

26:25.199 --> 26:26.532
You are welcome.

26:26.567 --> 26:28.301
But I am still a little upset with you.

26:28.335 --> 26:29.575
I mean, all I did

26:29.603 --> 26:31.070
was put the best team
I could on that stage.

26:31.105 --> 26:33.072
You were the one that started
in with the dirty tricks,

26:33.107 --> 26:34.574
like sending Sam to steal my mail.

26:34.608 --> 26:35.975
I didn't do that.

26:36.010 --> 26:37.977
- Sue.
- Sue.

26:38.012 --> 26:39.646
Hey!

26:39.680 --> 26:41.147
Let's move this thing along, huh?

26:41.181 --> 26:43.516
These rotten tomatoes are getting restless.

26:43.550 --> 26:45.018
Great.

26:45.052 --> 26:47.553
Appreciate her, too.

26:47.588 --> 26:49.522
A good nemesis only makes you better.

26:49.556 --> 26:52.036
Break a leg.

26:53.227 --> 26:55.762
Well, that can't be good.

26:55.796 --> 26:57.096
Okay, you ready for this?

26:57.131 --> 26:58.331
All right, cool. Here we go.

26:58.365 --> 26:59.732
Oh! Okay.

26:59.767 --> 27:02.769
This is, this is a,
uh, a creamy pasta dish.

27:02.803 --> 27:05.283
And we said that if we
ever had a celebrity child,

27:05.306 --> 27:07.173
this is what we would name it.

27:07.207 --> 27:09.175
- Fettuccini Alfredo.
- Yes! Yes.

27:09.209 --> 27:10.710
- I always liked that name.
- Yeah.

27:10.744 --> 27:12.412
- Alfredo.
- The little fettuccine.

27:12.446 --> 27:14.013
- Little-little feta.
- Aw...

27:14.048 --> 27:15.181
- Um, all right.
- Mm-hmm.

27:15.215 --> 27:16.616
Um, okay.

27:16.650 --> 27:18.952
If... if I was an ironic rapper,

27:18.986 --> 27:20.420
this would be my name.

27:20.454 --> 27:21.587
- Ironic rapper.
- Okay.

27:21.622 --> 27:23.423
We-we drink it when we, um...

27:23.457 --> 27:25.058
when we were, when we were playing...

27:25.092 --> 27:26.759
when we were ice skating at Bryant Park.

27:26.794 --> 27:28.428
- Definitely would have to
be something with... - Um...

27:28.462 --> 27:30.129
- ...hot chocolate.
- Yes! Yes.

27:30.164 --> 27:31.397
- Hot chocolate.
- Mm-hmm.

27:31.432 --> 27:32.532
That would be your ironic rapper name.

27:32.566 --> 27:33.566
Good one. Good job.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.760
You would be MC Hot Chocolate.

27:34.768 --> 27:36.135
MC Hot Chocolate.

27:36.170 --> 27:37.704
Oh, the life I never lived.

27:37.738 --> 27:39.138
What a tragedy. You're
in the wrong profession.

27:39.173 --> 27:40.440
What are you, a teacher now? Mm-hmm.

27:40.474 --> 27:41.474
- Yeah.
- You're blowing it.

27:41.508 --> 27:42.909
Okay, my turn. MC Hot Chocolate

27:42.943 --> 27:44.544
is calling your name. All right.

27:44.578 --> 27:46.479
Okay.

27:46.513 --> 27:47.981
Um, okay, this is a dessert.

27:48.015 --> 27:49.549
It's cold. Uh...

27:49.583 --> 27:51.217
- Um, it comes in a cart...
- Parfait.

27:51.251 --> 27:53.086
Oh, uh, Dave eats this all the time.

27:53.120 --> 27:54.587
Like, he...

27:54.622 --> 27:56.222
a little too much, if you ask me.

27:56.256 --> 27:58.736
He eats so much of this...

27:59.927 --> 28:01.967
So hot in here, I think I'm gonna be sick.

28:08.636 --> 28:11.471
Because you refuse to give back

28:11.505 --> 28:14.407
to the world the Klaine
romance you're depriving it...

28:14.441 --> 28:17.910
A romance it so desperately needs...

28:17.945 --> 28:20.647
We're going to change the game a little.

28:20.681 --> 28:22.849
What is that?

28:22.883 --> 28:25.118
It's the drug Tadalifil

28:25.152 --> 28:26.619
in aerosol form.

28:26.654 --> 28:29.922
And it's filling this room

28:29.957 --> 28:31.824
right now.

28:31.859 --> 28:35.361
It promotes sexual stimulation
by increased blood flow

28:35.396 --> 28:37.263
to the male genitalia.

28:39.566 --> 28:43.102
Try to resist the love you
have for one another, Klaine.

28:43.137 --> 28:45.838
Just know that if you choose to resist,

28:45.873 --> 28:48.107
you choose to die.

28:48.142 --> 28:49.275
The choice is yours.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.778
I want to get out of here.

28:51.812 --> 28:54.280
It's just so hot, and...

28:54.315 --> 28:55.715
Yes.

28:55.749 --> 28:58.151
Not sexually hot.

28:58.185 --> 28:59.619
It's just actually hot,

28:59.653 --> 29:01.321
and I want to go home, I
want to get out of here.

29:01.355 --> 29:03.823
Yes. Listen to Blaine.

29:09.012 --> 29:13.476
Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf
of everyone at McKinley,

36:49.822 --> 36:51.689
ladies and gentlemen, from Dalton Academy,

36:51.723 --> 36:53.843
- the Warblers.
- What?

36:55.694 --> 36:57.662
You really didn't do a very good job.

Congratulations.

this year's runner-up and winner

37:16.048 --> 37:17.348

37:20.118 --> 37:21.819
first place for this year's invitational...

37:21.854 --> 37:23.221
I don't know how they did it,

37:23.255 --> 37:24.889
because they were sitting on stools,

37:24.923 --> 37:26.357
singing in unison...

37:26.391 --> 37:28.431
Ladies and gentlemen, from McKinley High,

37:28.460 --> 37:29.594
New Directions!

37:47.980 --> 37:49.614
I'm sorry, Clint.

37:49.648 --> 37:51.182
I-I know that you feel disappointed.

37:51.216 --> 37:53.117
Disappointed?

37:53.152 --> 37:54.619
Look, it's not always about winning.

37:54.653 --> 37:55.753
Come on, please.

37:55.787 --> 37:57.288
You screwed us, Schuester.

37:57.322 --> 37:59.423
You care more about your
little prodigal troll,

37:59.458 --> 38:01.025
Rachel Berry, than us.

38:01.059 --> 38:03.628
I'm a senior; this matters to me.

38:03.662 --> 38:05.129
So you better watch your back.

38:05.164 --> 38:06.464
Don't talk to me like that.

38:06.498 --> 38:07.865
I'm your coach and your teacher.

38:07.900 --> 38:10.001
We'll see about that.

38:20.846 --> 38:22.146
Like what you see?

38:23.916 --> 38:26.884
Sweet William, here we are again.

38:26.919 --> 38:28.619
Well, I hope you're happy, Sue.

38:28.654 --> 38:30.121
Oh, I am.

38:30.155 --> 38:31.622
I'm absolutely over the moon, actually.

38:31.657 --> 38:33.624
Something profound
happened to me out there,

38:33.659 --> 38:35.560
listening to that music.

38:35.594 --> 38:37.595
I've purged the anger.

38:37.629 --> 38:39.831
Well, I'm happy for you, Sue.

38:39.865 --> 38:41.899
Oh, I'm happy for me, too.

38:41.934 --> 38:44.735
And if you...

38:44.770 --> 38:47.238
ever...

38:47.272 --> 38:50.241
litter at my school again
and expect me to clean it up,

38:50.275 --> 38:52.577
you sorry excuse for a stain

38:52.611 --> 38:56.514
on a dead tramp's lacy panties,

38:56.548 --> 38:58.683
I swear to sweet holy Satan,

38:58.717 --> 39:01.052
I will end you.

39:11.063 --> 39:12.864
Hello, Klaine.

39:12.898 --> 39:14.265
Stop calling us that!

39:14.299 --> 39:16.100
Are you aware we could have you locked up

39:16.135 --> 39:17.535
in a federal prison for 20 years?

39:17.569 --> 39:19.637
What you did to us falls
under the legal definition

39:19.671 --> 39:20.972
of kidnapping.

39:21.006 --> 39:23.307
I genuinely have no idea
what you're talking about.

39:23.342 --> 39:26.310
Are you kidding? We were
locked in an overheated elevator

39:26.345 --> 39:29.213
with a little Sue Sylvester
thing in a tracksuit

39:29.248 --> 39:31.382
and on-on a tricycle with a
hideous papier-mâché face.

39:31.417 --> 39:32.884
Remember that?

39:32.918 --> 39:35.553
Becky did it.

39:35.587 --> 39:37.155
- I can't. This is pointless.
- You know what?

39:37.189 --> 39:38.523
Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on a sec.

39:38.557 --> 39:40.792
Y-You know... you know what, Sue?

39:40.826 --> 39:43.461
Whatever you were trying to do,

39:43.495 --> 39:45.329
I want you to know that...

39:45.364 --> 39:47.331
it backfired.

39:47.366 --> 39:51.302
Because all it really
did was help Kurt and I

39:51.336 --> 39:54.672
get over whatever resentment
and whatever bitterness

39:54.706 --> 39:56.808
we were holding in, and it made us realize

39:56.842 --> 40:00.311
that-that we are... we're-we're
just better as friends, okay?

40:00.345 --> 40:02.513
So we should actually thank you.

40:02.548 --> 40:03.581
Well, then thank me.

40:03.615 --> 40:05.917
- Thank you.
- Don't actually thank her.

40:05.951 --> 40:07.819
So...

40:07.853 --> 40:09.821
Klaine is no more, huh?

40:09.855 --> 40:11.356
Okay.

40:11.390 --> 40:15.326
Well, guess I'll have to find a new hobby,

40:15.361 --> 40:18.496
like operating a bookmaking
outfit that runs the numbers

40:18.530 --> 40:21.232
on which of your current
boyfriends dies first.

40:21.266 --> 40:26.838
The gropey geriatric that
Porcelain reads the newspaper to

40:26.872 --> 40:29.107
or the bloated, suicidal,
diabetic ex-bully

40:29.141 --> 40:34.245
that the gay, shaven, teenage
Tom Selleck chooses to bone.

40:41.286 --> 40:44.956
Becky, this space feels
more like somebody's memory

40:44.990 --> 40:48.126
of a storage unit, and
that memory is fading.

40:49.995 --> 40:52.797
It's like there was never
anything here but jungle.

40:52.831 --> 40:54.899
What are you talking about?

40:54.933 --> 40:58.736
And time, well, time is a flat circle.

40:58.771 --> 41:03.608
And we have had a most awesome week, Becky.

41:03.642 --> 41:05.610
Honestly, what we accomplished in this week

41:05.644 --> 41:07.278
makes it feel like two weeks.

41:07.312 --> 41:09.480
Your plan didn't work out.

41:09.515 --> 41:13.318
Kurt and Gay Blaine aren't together.

41:13.352 --> 41:15.953
Oh, Becky.

41:15.988 --> 41:18.489
I've got Klaine right where I want them.

41:18.524 --> 41:20.992
See here? Right on schedule.

41:21.026 --> 41:24.162
Week five, Klaine friends again.

41:24.196 --> 41:27.332
We still have six more weeks for scheming,

41:27.366 --> 41:30.868
possibly seven, depending
on network preemptions.

41:32.037 --> 41:33.671
This is kind of garbage.

41:33.706 --> 41:35.406
That's not even a real trophy.

41:35.441 --> 41:37.308
It's a start.

41:37.343 --> 41:41.179
From small things, big things one day come.

41:41.213 --> 41:42.780
Hold up, Rachel.

41:42.815 --> 41:43.815
I got this.

41:44.650 --> 41:45.783
Listen up, noobs.

41:46.952 --> 41:48.186
We just went up against

41:48.220 --> 41:49.520
the two best show choirs in the state.

41:49.555 --> 41:50.955
They were full of seniors

41:50.990 --> 41:52.857
who have been working together for years.

41:52.891 --> 41:54.171
They thought they were gonna come

41:54.193 --> 41:56.094
into our house and push us around.

41:56.128 --> 41:58.208
But now they all went home
feeling like their willies

41:58.230 --> 41:59.230
are two inches shorter.

41:59.231 --> 42:00.765
Now, I expect to make fun

42:00.799 --> 42:03.034
of all of you at some point. Fat kid,

42:03.068 --> 42:05.270
gay boy, creepy incest twins, other girl.

42:05.304 --> 42:08.773
But I never want to hear any
of you disparaging the things

42:08.807 --> 42:10.942
that we do as a team.

42:10.976 --> 42:12.610
Got it?

42:12.645 --> 42:13.945
Um...

42:13.979 --> 42:15.780
can I just say something?

42:15.814 --> 42:18.149
I just wanted to say thank you to Ms. Berry

42:18.183 --> 42:20.818
and Mr. Hummel for, you
know, bringing us all together

42:20.853 --> 42:22.720
and helping us do so well up there.

42:22.755 --> 42:24.389
You guys are both really good teachers.

42:24.423 --> 42:27.458
Thank you. As your teachers, we just

42:27.493 --> 42:30.128
want to say how proud of you guys we are.

42:30.162 --> 42:31.563
I mean, I never would've
thought coming back here

42:31.597 --> 42:33.164
that I would step on a
stage without disintegrating

42:33.198 --> 42:35.667
into a puddle, but thank
you, guys, so much just for...

42:35.701 --> 42:37.635
I heard she tends
to make everything about herself.

42:37.670 --> 42:39.504
Shh, if you're
gonna say things like that to me,

42:39.538 --> 42:41.372
you need to use your psychic inside voice.

42:41.407 --> 42:43.841
It's just the
beginning, guys. - Got it?

42:43.876 --> 42:47.248
Everyone put your hand in. I'm gonna lead
you through an ancient Glee tradition.

42:47.287 --> 42:50.866
All right, on three, give me an
"amazing." Kitty, count us in.

42:50.891 --> 42:54.385
- One, two, three.
- Amazing!
