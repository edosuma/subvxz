WEBVTT

00:10.916 --> 00:12.500
[Luna] Children of Selemene,

00:13.083 --> 00:17.250
a thousand years ago,
our goddess cast out the nonbelievers

00:17.333 --> 00:19.041
from the Nightsilver Woods.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.916
In her mercy,

00:21.000 --> 00:26.375
she allowed them to live in peace
in the enclaves by the light of her moon.

00:26.458 --> 00:32.541
Now these elves,
these apostates, rise against her.

00:32.625 --> 00:36.500
They gather now to march
on the Nightsilver Woods.

00:36.583 --> 00:38.916
On you and your children.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.000
To plunge the world into ceaseless shadow.

00:42.083 --> 00:46.166
We are the line the shadow will not cross.

00:46.750 --> 00:49.833
We are the light in the darkness.

00:49.916 --> 00:51.750
[soldiers] Crescent light upon you!

00:51.833 --> 00:53.250
[Luna] Dark Moon Order…

00:54.291 --> 00:55.750
to war!

00:55.833 --> 00:57.750
[soldiers shouting]

00:57.833 --> 01:00.416
[suspenseful music]

01:01.708 --> 01:03.041
[zapping]

01:08.625 --> 01:09.791
[zaps]

01:16.875 --> 01:19.500
[suspenseful music]

01:28.541 --> 01:30.875
[ominous music]

01:35.083 --> 01:36.166
[both gasp]

01:40.166 --> 01:44.500
Elves of Coedwig,
your rebellion ends today.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.208
Lay down your arms.

01:52.041 --> 01:53.166
[strings tighten]

01:57.500 --> 01:59.375
So be it.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.416
[child crying]

02:07.750 --> 02:11.583
There is only one Goddess of the moon.

02:14.541 --> 02:15.791
Me.

02:22.791 --> 02:24.791
[ominous music]

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
[epic music]

02:45.416 --> 02:47.416
[epic music intensifies]

03:13.750 --> 03:15.750
[suspenseful music]

03:20.291 --> 03:21.333
[Mirana groans]

03:21.416 --> 03:22.666
[grunting]

03:30.833 --> 03:32.625
[growls softly]

03:36.166 --> 03:37.541
[breathes heavily]

03:39.500 --> 03:40.833
Oh.

03:40.916 --> 03:43.250
[breathes heavily]

03:47.708 --> 03:51.291
[Mirana] It's the Sage's valley,
but I don't see his tower.

03:53.291 --> 03:55.083
It has to be here somewhere.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.958
The dragon knew to bring us here.

04:04.625 --> 04:06.041
Davion.

04:12.750 --> 04:14.875
[breathes heavily]

04:15.791 --> 04:20.958
[Davion grunting]
Mirana? Marci? Kaden?

04:21.958 --> 04:23.666
Where the hell am I?

04:32.708 --> 04:34.708
[mysterious music]

04:40.125 --> 04:41.208
[gasps]

04:57.541 --> 05:00.583
You do not belong here, human.

05:02.041 --> 05:03.833
Intrusion.

05:03.916 --> 05:06.208
I don't even know where here is.

05:06.791 --> 05:12.750
It dreams of Slyrak,
and Slyrak dreams of it.

05:12.833 --> 05:16.791
You stand with the Thunder,
on Slyrak's peak.

05:16.875 --> 05:20.916
The Father of Fire is trapped
in the flesh-illusion.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.541
That doesn't help me.

05:22.625 --> 05:25.750
The last thing I remember,
I was chained to a wall and…

05:25.833 --> 05:29.000
Slyrak believes a demon hunts us.

05:29.083 --> 05:30.083
[Davion] A demon?

05:30.166 --> 05:33.125
Our brother Uldorak cried out a name.

05:33.875 --> 05:38.625
You would call him Terrorblade.
The name woke Slyrak from his slumber.

05:38.708 --> 05:39.833
He went to see.

05:39.916 --> 05:44.541
Now, Uldorak is silent. Slyrak is silent.

05:44.625 --> 05:48.000
-Dead.
-Yet not reborn.

05:48.083 --> 05:50.083
We do not die as you do.

05:50.166 --> 05:54.458
Everything that we are
passes into a new body.

05:54.541 --> 05:59.500
There is only you,
and you do not know the song.

05:59.583 --> 06:02.541
[inhales sharply]
Perhaps he is the demon,

06:02.625 --> 06:05.166
wearing mouse skin.

06:05.666 --> 06:09.041
What fun!
[laughs]

06:09.541 --> 06:11.333
Let's split him open.

06:11.416 --> 06:13.958
Let's see.

06:24.666 --> 06:25.833
Davion?

06:25.916 --> 06:27.000
Are you in there?

06:28.458 --> 06:29.916
[screams, groans]

06:30.833 --> 06:32.000
Mirana?

06:32.083 --> 06:34.250
It feels my bite.

06:34.333 --> 06:37.333
[Davion] I… I can feel her.

06:37.416 --> 06:39.458
[groans]
She's worried.

06:39.541 --> 06:40.875
Confused.

06:41.375 --> 06:42.916
Trying to help me.

06:43.916 --> 06:46.041
Him. Oh, no.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.791
Slyrak awakens.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.125
-[crackling]
-[Mirana grunts]

07:01.583 --> 07:03.958

07:06.291 --> 07:07.250
[snarls]

07:12.916 --> 07:14.625
[suspenseful music]

07:15.583 --> 07:17.041
[roars]

07:23.875 --> 07:25.625
[fire blazing]

07:29.333 --> 07:30.875
-[Mirana yells]
-[Sagan growls]

07:33.166 --> 07:34.708
[Slyrak snarls]

07:35.666 --> 07:37.291

07:41.375 --> 07:43.166
[Slyrak growls]

07:45.625 --> 07:46.458

07:46.541 --> 07:47.791
[grunts]

07:54.083 --> 07:56.125
[suspenseful music]

07:56.625 --> 07:57.541
[Mirana] Sagan…

07:58.625 --> 08:00.125
Jaro!

08:08.583 --> 08:09.583
-[crash]
-[Mirana grunts]

08:10.750 --> 08:11.666
[grunts]

08:11.750 --> 08:12.666
[snarls]

08:14.916 --> 08:16.583
[grunts, thuds]

08:17.208 --> 08:19.125
[Mirana panting]

08:23.250 --> 08:25.916
I'm not… None of this is real.

08:26.833 --> 08:30.250
Slyrak is in the world. With them.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.708
With her.

08:31.791 --> 08:35.666
Angry. Disoriented. Hungry.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.416
Questions.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.750
I need to wake up.

08:39.375 --> 08:40.416
Ugh!

08:40.916 --> 08:42.208
Why can't I wake up?

08:42.291 --> 08:45.833
[hisses]
The little mouse amuses me.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.916
Kill it slowly.

08:49.000 --> 08:52.416
Perhaps it screams.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.916
Mercy. Good can come of this.

08:56.833 --> 09:00.458
We will be patient. We will learn.

09:00.541 --> 09:02.083
What are you called?

09:02.166 --> 09:05.000
Davion. Dragon Knight.

09:05.083 --> 09:09.666
And how did you come to be here,
Davion Dragon Knight?

09:09.750 --> 09:11.291
I don't know.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.375
I don't remember.

09:14.416 --> 09:16.416
Right now, it doesn't matter.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.458
I will remember for you.

09:24.791 --> 09:27.333
-[sniffs]
-Huh?

09:27.416 --> 09:28.708
Oh!

09:28.791 --> 09:31.500
[groans]
Oh, Sagan.

09:31.583 --> 09:33.125
Oh, good boy.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.416
Marci?

09:37.750 --> 09:39.083
Marci, are you okay?

09:42.166 --> 09:43.833
[Slyrak growls]

09:47.000 --> 09:47.958
Come.

09:48.041 --> 09:50.625
Come on. On your feet.
[grunts]

09:54.666 --> 09:56.000
Come back.

10:03.458 --> 10:05.875
[suspenseful music]

10:07.000 --> 10:08.500
[Slyrak growling]

10:13.458 --> 10:14.750
[roars]

10:30.250 --> 10:31.833
[fire blazes]

10:39.500 --> 10:40.666
[Mirana] Balls.

10:46.416 --> 10:48.416
[epic music]

11:02.625 --> 11:04.625
[mysterious music]

11:25.583 --> 11:26.958
[grunts, groans]

11:27.458 --> 11:31.416
Gods. We… We fought together.

11:32.083 --> 11:36.000
Slyrak bound himself
to this tiny creature.

11:36.083 --> 11:37.541
Made them one.

11:37.625 --> 11:41.333
Body. Soul. Mind.

11:42.166 --> 11:43.375
He killed me.

11:43.458 --> 11:46.208
That is why it is here.

11:46.291 --> 11:50.416
The natural order is disrupted.
The cycle broken.

11:50.500 --> 11:53.916
Terrorblade has taken Uldorak.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.208
Slyrak has given us this.

11:56.791 --> 11:58.416
Violation.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.916
He's out there right now.
Crazy. He'll kill her!

12:03.833 --> 12:06.708
It is an abomination!

12:08.875 --> 12:13.250
Slyrak would not have undertaken
such a drastic measure without a purpose.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.416
We must divine it.

12:15.500 --> 12:18.583
The human showed mercy. Kindness.

12:18.666 --> 12:20.416
It is a Dragon Knight.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.625
It is food.

12:23.708 --> 12:24.875
Food…

12:24.958 --> 12:28.166
Perhaps there was no better option.

12:29.041 --> 12:35.666
Or he feared the demon might possess him
as he did Uldorak and steal his soul.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.375
Corrupted.

12:37.458 --> 12:40.666
Eldwyrms only do one thing
when you're awake.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.125
You eat.

12:42.708 --> 12:45.458
Mirana, Marci, they won't be enough.

12:46.250 --> 12:49.625
There are villages scattered
all around those mountains.

12:50.333 --> 12:52.791
You don't want me here,
I don't want him out there.

12:52.875 --> 12:55.625
Send me back, and maybe
we can help each other.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.125
Perhaps.

12:57.625 --> 13:03.583
After our questions have been answered,
and not a moment sooner.

13:07.666 --> 13:09.083
[Slyrak growling]

13:15.041 --> 13:16.875
Let's take a look at that leg.

13:30.041 --> 13:32.041
Hey, this is going to hurt.

13:33.166 --> 13:34.250
[Mirana grunts]

13:37.833 --> 13:39.666
We have to find a healer.

13:39.750 --> 13:42.583
If that wound gets infected,
there's nothing I can do out here.

13:42.666 --> 13:44.250
[Slyrak roaring]

13:51.708 --> 13:54.458
The Shopkeeper said this is where
we'd find the Sage,

13:54.541 --> 13:57.041
but there's not a damn thing down there.

13:59.208 --> 14:01.166
[sighs]
He made a fool of me.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.041
And I got us all killed.

14:06.416 --> 14:08.166
Marci, what are you doing?

14:11.958 --> 14:13.000
[Mirana gasps]

14:14.041 --> 14:17.708
The Shopkeeper said
we'd need this to see the Sage.

14:17.791 --> 14:20.833
It wasn't an offering, it was a riddle.
[sighs]

14:20.916 --> 14:22.166
A test.

14:23.083 --> 14:24.458
[sighs]
I failed.

14:25.333 --> 14:26.666
But you didn't.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.583
-[Slyrak growls]
-[Mirana gasps]

14:30.666 --> 14:32.666
[Mirana] Sagan should be able
to reach the bottom

14:32.750 --> 14:34.833
as long as you don't get roasted
along the way.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.000
You're going to make it.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.375
I'll make certain of it.

14:39.333 --> 14:42.000
-Sagan, yah!
-[growls]

14:50.458 --> 14:52.041
[Slyrak growling]

14:54.666 --> 14:59.458
We all want answers
about Uldorak, Terrorblade.

14:59.541 --> 15:04.333
Wake me up and I'll find them.
I'll finish what Slyrak started.

15:04.416 --> 15:07.291
Why should we trust you? You are a slayer.

15:07.375 --> 15:09.666
-A knight.
-You kill dragons.

15:09.750 --> 15:12.791
-Yes, but…
-You boast about killing dragons.

15:13.541 --> 15:14.708
It's my purpose.

15:14.791 --> 15:16.625
Your purpose is to kill?

15:17.291 --> 15:20.541
To defend the innocent.
Dragons kill people.

15:20.625 --> 15:24.541
-Many things kill your kind, do they not?
-Yes.

15:24.625 --> 15:27.291
Yet you kill us. Why?

15:31.791 --> 15:33.791
[mystical music]

15:39.458 --> 15:40.875
Answer.

15:44.208 --> 15:45.375
Because…

15:46.708 --> 15:48.333
Because I hate you.

15:48.833 --> 15:51.791
I hate every last gods-damned one of you.

15:52.333 --> 15:54.708
[epic music]

16:03.583 --> 16:04.541
[roars]

16:06.125 --> 16:07.291
[crash]

16:13.083 --> 16:14.958

[swoosh]

16:24.666 --> 16:26.375
[Slyrak growls]

16:27.291 --> 16:28.500
[Mirana yells]

16:31.916 --> 16:33.791
[panting]

16:37.666 --> 16:39.000
[breathes heavily]

16:42.833 --> 16:43.666
[Mirana grunts]

16:46.000 --> 16:48.958
[groans, grunts]

16:53.541 --> 16:55.666
A dragon killed my father,

16:55.750 --> 16:58.208
my mother, my brothers and sisters.

16:58.291 --> 17:03.208
My whole fucking village, gone.
Burnt to ash.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.458
[roaring]

17:11.333 --> 17:14.916
I devoted my life to killing
as many of you as I could find.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.750
And I found a lot.

17:21.125 --> 17:23.166
[groaning]

17:23.250 --> 17:25.208
[Slyrak growls]

17:31.708 --> 17:32.625
[whimpers]

17:33.208 --> 17:35.333
[breathing heavily]

17:39.041 --> 17:42.291
Come here, you scaly bastard!

17:45.958 --> 17:47.541
[grunts, groans]

17:47.625 --> 17:51.875
If I die today, my only regret
is I didn't kill more of you.

17:52.458 --> 17:54.291
[Eldwyrm 1] Yet you helped Slyrak.

17:54.958 --> 17:56.875
[Davion] I did. I helped him.

17:56.958 --> 17:59.958
I'd help him again,
even knowing I'd wind up here.

18:00.041 --> 18:04.125
Because no matter
how much I hate him, or you,

18:04.208 --> 18:07.666
what I saw in that cave, felt in my guts,

18:07.750 --> 18:10.000
I know the demon is worse.

18:10.083 --> 18:12.000
Terrorblade is worse.

18:12.541 --> 18:17.041
Now please, let's fix this
before anyone else dies.

18:17.125 --> 18:18.708
[Slyrak growling]

18:25.958 --> 18:27.958
What is your judgment?

18:28.041 --> 18:30.166
Let Slyrak be reborn,

18:30.250 --> 18:32.833
and he can tell us of this demon himself.

18:32.916 --> 18:35.083
He can share his plan.

18:35.166 --> 18:38.666
-Wait. What?
-Destroy the body. Release the soul.

18:41.083 --> 18:42.791
[grunting]

18:45.750 --> 18:50.291
The human must die that Slyrak may return.

18:50.375 --> 18:55.250
Let the Thunder sing as one voice.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.500
[epic music]

19:00.791 --> 19:02.625
[grunting]

19:06.666 --> 19:10.291
Kill the little mouse. Eat it.

19:13.166 --> 19:14.416
[groaning]
Mirana.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.416
-[Davion] She's…
-[grunts]

19:16.500 --> 19:19.458
He's killing her. Fucking do it!

19:19.541 --> 19:22.083
Kill me before Slyrak kills her!

19:29.916 --> 19:32.458
[Mirana panting, grunting]

19:35.541 --> 19:38.166
[Mirana breathing heavily]

19:43.791 --> 19:44.875
Come on.

19:44.958 --> 19:47.583
I can feel you in there, Davion.

19:49.166 --> 19:51.125
I know you have the strength.

19:51.208 --> 19:53.500
I know you can take control.

19:56.666 --> 19:58.583
[roars]

20:03.958 --> 20:05.375
Davion!

20:07.375 --> 20:10.375
Mirana.

20:11.500 --> 20:14.125
You slay monsters, not people.

20:24.166 --> 20:26.375
Death.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.541
No.

20:31.208 --> 20:33.291
[thunder rumbles]

20:36.750 --> 20:37.791
[groans]

20:38.458 --> 20:41.250
[grunting, groaning]

20:42.916 --> 20:45.000
[screaming]

20:48.833 --> 20:50.416
[roaring]

20:50.500 --> 20:51.875
Davion…

20:54.166 --> 20:55.458
[crash]

21:01.250 --> 21:02.541
[exhales sharply]

21:11.458 --> 21:14.000
[tranquil music]

21:16.250 --> 21:17.875
-[grunts faintly]
-Mirana?

21:22.291 --> 21:24.458
[breathing heavily]

21:25.041 --> 21:26.958
Mirana, I'm so sorry. I…

21:27.458 --> 21:30.041
Marci? And Sagan?

21:30.125 --> 21:31.208
No.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.500
-They're… They're in…
-Don't talk.

21:35.416 --> 21:39.375
Just breathe.
I'll find you help. Somewhere.

21:40.541 --> 21:41.625
[Mirana] Look.

21:51.583 --> 21:53.583
[somber music]

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
[somber music continues]

22:16.333 --> 22:18.791

22:21.625 --> 22:25.041
[breathes deeply]

22:32.000 --> 22:33.083
[grunts]

22:38.416 --> 22:39.916
We have visitors.

22:40.666 --> 22:41.833
Hmm.

22:42.416 --> 22:45.583
From the Nightsilver Woods.
I've been expecting her.

22:45.666 --> 22:47.333
She's come for the lotuses.

22:54.208 --> 22:56.208
[epic music]

22:58.208 --> 23:00.708
[panting]

23:02.458 --> 23:04.458
[closing theme music]
