WEBVTT

00:01.820 --> 00:04.084
Previously onSEAL Team...
That's Steve Porter's drill.

00:04.130 --> 00:05.609
He got something on it
during an op.

00:05.650 --> 00:07.789
Mm-hmm.
And he asked me
ifI would take it in

00:07.830 --> 00:09.604
to have our labs test it.

00:09.660 --> 00:11.082
What did the lab have to say
about it?

00:11.140 --> 00:13.176
Just had dirt on it.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.039
But if you really want to know
what's on this thing,

00:15.100 --> 00:17.056
I got to send that out
to our lab in Germany.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.055
Can you keep that quiet?

00:18.100 --> 00:19.442
The real story

00:19.490 --> 00:21.048
is rare-earth metals.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.751
Stuff's in cell phones,
laptops.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.792
And apparently this
country is sitting

00:26.850 --> 00:29.102
on about a trillion dollars'
worth just underneath the dirt,

00:29.150 --> 00:30.583
just waiting for
somebody to drill.

00:30.630 --> 00:32.063
So last night we hear
that someone's planning to hit

00:32.110 --> 00:33.543
our congressional delegation,

00:33.590 --> 00:34.989
and today, Abu Ali,

00:35.030 --> 00:37.112
one _of the world's_ best
assassms, turns up In town.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.411
You think
that's a coincidence?

00:38.470 --> 00:39.892
I sure as hell hope so.

00:39.950 --> 00:40.905
RAY:
Gun at two o'clock.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.551
RAY: He's on the move.
JASON: Bravo 2,

00:43.600 --> 00:44.510
frag him.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.513
We got a phone.

00:50.570 --> 00:52.253
MANDY: A text came in
after you picked it off him.

00:52.310 --> 00:53.823
JASON:
Whoever hired that sniper

00:53.870 --> 00:55.519
thinks he's still alive.

01:26.470 --> 01:27.596
Come on.

01:27.650 --> 01:28.867
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

01:28.910 --> 01:31.515
Negative on the target.
We were too late.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.380
Did not find our assassin.

01:35.440 --> 01:37.214
Hey, where is Abu Ali?

01:37.270 --> 01:39.397
Huh

01:50.980 --> 01:52.754
SONNY:
I'm confused.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.108
So we're faking raids
to make it look

01:54.150 --> 01:55.708
like we're searching
for a sniper

01:55.760 --> 01:58.228
that's already dead?
Yes, Abu Ali.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.541
Yeah, and grabbing
our interpreter

01:59.590 --> 02:00.841
accomplishes that how?

02:00.900 --> 02:02.549
Well, we want to make it
look like we're trying

02:02.600 --> 02:04.079
to smoke him out, Sonny.
He doesn't mind.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.417
Do you mind?
IfI want to spend my life

02:05.470 --> 02:06.767
pretending to be a terrorist,

02:06.820 --> 02:08.333
I would move to Hollywood.
SONNY: Hey, listen.

02:08.380 --> 02:09.904
Quit your whining,
or I'm gonna put that bag

02:09.950 --> 02:11.121
back on your head.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.078
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

02:14.130 --> 02:15.427
We're heading back,
unless you want us

02:15.480 --> 02:17.084
to do some more fake hits.

02:17.130 --> 02:19.394
What's that,
our fourth one tonight?

02:19.440 --> 02:21.169
Ninth once you add
in Alpha Team's.

02:21.220 --> 02:22.528
I think we're good.

02:22.570 --> 02:23.878
Yeah, I agree.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.706
I mean, I think anyone
that's paying attention's

02:25.750 --> 02:28.184
got to believe
we're looking for somebody.

02:28.230 --> 02:29.356
Copy that, 1.

02:29.410 --> 02:31.059
Come on home.

02:34.190 --> 02:36.238
You got to be kidding me, huh?

02:36.280 --> 02:38.271
There's no way
I'm drinking that, okay?

02:38.330 --> 02:39.809
If we're gonna call it a night,
I'm gonna need something

02:39.850 --> 02:42.239
a lot stronger after
four hours of SDR.

02:42.290 --> 02:44.064
Amen.
Well, I got vodka.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.724
You got vodka?

02:45.770 --> 02:47.670
No, I do not have vodka.

02:47.730 --> 02:50.290
Come on, Davis.
Don't play me like that.

02:50.340 --> 02:52.467
MANDY: The raids
are working.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.169
Fake raids aren't raids.
Fake raids.

02:54.210 --> 02:56.030
Okay, fine.
The fake raids...

02:56.080 --> 02:57.251
SONNY: Well, speaking
of fake raids,

02:57.300 --> 02:58.733
can we start
using fake SEALs?

02:58.780 --> 03:00.304
Where are we gonna find
some fake SEALs?

03:00.350 --> 03:02.250
Any bar in Virginia Beach.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.562
MANDY;
As I was saying,

03:04.610 --> 03:06.953
the fake raids
seem to be working.

03:07.010 --> 03:08.489
According to the chatter,

03:08.530 --> 03:11.260
so far everyone believes
the sniper who shot Salim Hakan

03:11.320 --> 03:12.969
is still alive and in the wind.

03:13.010 --> 03:15.092
That ain't gonna hold forever.

03:15.150 --> 03:16.401
Doesn't have to
hold for long.

03:16.450 --> 03:18.270
Just until we find
the client who hired him.

03:18.320 --> 03:20.459
Guy on the other end
of this phone.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.456
What exactly is your plan?

03:22.500 --> 03:25.151
The last text the client sent

03:25.200 --> 03:27.452
said the remainder
of Abu Ali's payment

03:27.510 --> 03:29.410
would be available in 48 hours,

03:29.470 --> 03:31.984
about midday today.

03:32.030 --> 03:34.498
Our plan is to
send the client a text

03:34.560 --> 03:36.039
saying the money
never got to us.

03:37.730 --> 03:39.129
You're gonna impersonate
the sniper?

03:39.170 --> 03:40.478
Over text.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.169
What if they were using a code,
he and the client?

03:42.220 --> 03:43.642
DAVIS:
They weren't.

03:43.700 --> 03:44.860
We went over the _entire
correspondence history

03:44.920 --> 03:45.989
with the techs.

03:46.050 --> 03:47.733
They're speaking
standard Arabic.

03:47.790 --> 03:50.395
No suspiciously odd grammar,
no suspiciously repeated words.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.658
JASON: That's great, but what
about after the 48 hours?

03:52.710 --> 03:54.575
What exactly
are you gonna text back to them?

03:54.620 --> 03:56.963
"Show me the money."
Only way

03:57.010 --> 03:58.568
this gets us somewhere is if
the guy on the other end

03:58.620 --> 04:00.235
of the phone shows up
somewhere we can grab him.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.793
SONNY:
Do you think a guy

04:01.850 --> 04:03.363
that brings in a
sniper from Syria

04:03.410 --> 04:05.753
to take out
a high-profile target

04:05.810 --> 04:07.584
is gonna drop off his own money?

04:07.630 --> 04:09.507
Come on now. _
If he sends an underllng,

04:09.550 --> 04:11.586
we follow the underling back
to whoever he works for.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.892
Yeah, the people
who took out Echo Team.

04:13.940 --> 04:15.635
Look, the phone's our only
link between our assassin

04:15.690 --> 04:16.987
and the guy who hired him.

04:17.030 --> 04:18.907
All right, if we're
gonna use that phone

04:18.950 --> 04:20.815
to get the client to
stick his head out,

04:20.860 --> 04:23.556
then we need to do it before he
realizes the assassin's dead.

04:23.610 --> 04:25.555
On second thought...
JASON: Whoa.

04:25.610 --> 04:28.477
Where-where exactly
are you going?

04:28.520 --> 04:30.784
I'm gonna see ifI can't buy us
some more time.

04:41.450 --> 04:43.793
You're not an easy woman
to get a hold of.

04:43.840 --> 04:46.536
Well, I've been a little busy
hunting the sniper

04:46.590 --> 04:49.582
who targeted an American
congressional delegation.

04:49.630 --> 04:51.234
"The coward who martyred
our great friend and ally,

04:51.290 --> 04:54.157
General Salim Hakan."
Yeah, I read the DoD statement.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.668
Amazing what death can do
for your public image.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.949
Salim was always
a saw PR man.

04:59.990 --> 05:01.116
And no truth to the rumor

05:01.170 --> 05:02.330
the assassin was killed
at the scene?

05:02.380 --> 05:04.553
If the assassin's dead,

05:04.600 --> 05:06.386
who are we so
busy looking for?

05:06.430 --> 05:07.909
How should I know?

05:07.950 --> 05:10.032
Maybe you guys are using
this manhunt as an excuse

05:10.090 --> 05:12.991
to further intimidate
the local population.

05:13.050 --> 05:14.859
Since when do we need an excuse?

05:14.920 --> 05:17.741
So he's alive, the sniper?

05:17.790 --> 05:19.576
Far as I know.

05:19.620 --> 05:22.396
I don't suppose
you've I.D.'d him yet.

05:22.450 --> 05:24.350
Or, if you have,
you'd care to share.

05:24.410 --> 05:26.355
Mm.

05:27.630 --> 05:30.929
We think he's a Syrian national

05:30.980 --> 05:32.845
known as

05:32.890 --> 05:34.369
Abu Ali.

05:34.420 --> 05:37.412
Long rsum of high-profile
murders-for-hire.

05:37.460 --> 05:40.190
Wow. Thank you.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.593
Should I assume that
this is off

05:42.640 --> 05:45.939
You can quote me
as an unnamed source

05:45.990 --> 05:47.423
from the intel community.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.949
What?
I'm just not used

05:51.000 --> 05:52.251
to you giving me anything.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.951
Usually you bat your eyelashes

05:55.000 --> 05:57.560
and ask me to do something that
provides exactly zero benefit

05:57.610 --> 05:59.089
for me or
the people I work for.

05:59.140 --> 06:00.391
Well, consider it a thank-you.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.431
Two-way street.
Exactly.

06:02.490 --> 06:05.050
We believe he's still in J-Bad,
by the way.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.614
Abu Ali. He's laying low

06:07.670 --> 06:09.444
until we get tired
of looking for him.

06:09.490 --> 06:11.924
Smart. Guys get caught
when they move.

06:14.020 --> 06:16.887
I wish I could figure out
how you're playing me.

06:16.940 --> 06:19.408
It's such a shame
to see such canCIsm

06:19.460 --> 06:20.893
in one so young.

06:20.940 --> 06:22.851
Yeah, right.

06:30.250 --> 06:32.161
It‘s been almost an hour
smce the time they set.

06:32.210 --> 06:34.428
If the client's planning
on paying our dead sniper,

06:34.480 --> 06:35.549
he's done it by now.

06:35.610 --> 06:36.907
I know.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.643
Then we good to go?

06:38.700 --> 06:40.656
Look, it's a good plan.

06:40.700 --> 06:41.917
Yeah.

06:41.960 --> 06:44.008
It's the plan we got, anyway.

06:44.050 --> 06:45.483
Read me the message
we're sending one more time.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.873
"Where's my money?
This is unacceptable."

06:49.930 --> 06:51.534
Send it.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.580
SONNY: Our dead sniper's
back in action.

06:56.630 --> 06:58.621
All right, so what now?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.103
Now we wait.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.549
SONNY:
Okay.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.376
For how long?

07:08.120 --> 07:10.020
We wait, Sonny.
That's what we do.

07:10.080 --> 07:11.593
As long as it takes, we wait.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.551
Oh, here we go.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.511
Guy wrote back.
"What do you mean?

07:15.560 --> 07:17.425
The money should be
in the account."

07:17.480 --> 07:19.084
What do you want me to say?

07:19.130 --> 07:20.563
Tell him

07:20.610 --> 07:22.305
all you know is it wasn't there
when you checked,

07:22.350 --> 07:24.864
and anyway, now that
the media has your name,

07:24.920 --> 07:27.218
you're gonna need the payment
in cash so you can disappear.

07:27.270 --> 07:28.828
You get all that?

07:28.880 --> 07:30.700
Yeah.

07:35.750 --> 07:37.570
SONNY: _
Now we waIt again.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.584
Come on.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.029
Sonny, get him, get him.

07:46.070 --> 07:48.584
Yeah, come on.
Oh!

07:48.640 --> 07:49.982
Oh, here we go.

07:50.030 --> 07:51.543
Get him.
Got to reload.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.467
JASON: Almost.
Oh, that was almost your foot.

07:54.510 --> 07:56.649
All right, listen up.
Listen up, Sonny.

07:56.690 --> 07:58.726
AV, ay, Ya-
Listen up.

07:58.780 --> 08:00.907
This is Sergeant
Percy Jacobs.

08:00.950 --> 08:02.474
He's a case officer

08:02.520 --> 08:04.476
with the Army's Criminal
Investigative Division.

08:04.520 --> 08:07.785
Okay. So what's
he investigating?

08:07.830 --> 08:09.309
No one's under investigation.

08:09.350 --> 08:11.955
I'm following up on the death
of a noncombatant.

08:12.010 --> 08:13.568
Do you mind?
JASON:
No.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.264
A local family brought us

08:16.320 --> 08:18.311
this cell phone footage.

08:30.160 --> 08:31.718
The boy was ten years old.

08:31.770 --> 08:33.419
We believe he was hit

08:33.460 --> 08:36.941
by an M67
fragmentation grenade.

08:36.990 --> 08:38.548
Well, that's sad and all,

08:38.600 --> 08:40.079
but what has that got to do
with us?

08:40.120 --> 08:42.463
It happened when we were
running down the sniper.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.557
Kid lived right beside
the target building.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.089
JACOBS: Now, before I go
looking into your AARs,

08:47.130 --> 08:48.438
does anyone...
It was my frag.

08:48.480 --> 08:49.959
Ray.
ERIC:
Hey, we don't know that.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.251
RAY:
No, I...

08:51.310 --> 08:53.266
I threw a frag
to flush the guy out.

08:53.310 --> 08:54.481
It missed.

08:54.530 --> 08:56.486
ISR and comms will confirm.

08:56.530 --> 08:58.612
So you weren't
targeting the boy?
SONNY: Hold on a second.

08:58.660 --> 09:00.446
Did you really just say that?
RAY: It's okay, Sonny.

09:00.490 --> 09:02.048
No, I wasn't targeting him.

09:02.100 --> 09:03.408
I just made a bad throw is all.

09:03.450 --> 09:06.055
You understand
it's my job to ask?

09:06.110 --> 09:08.749
RAY:
I understand.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.017
So, what happens next?

09:10.070 --> 09:12.891
We'll go over the comms logs,
any ISR footage.

09:12.940 --> 09:16.285
If it happened the way you said,
shouldn't be much of a problem.

09:16.330 --> 09:18.378
I've assured Sergeant Jacobs

09:18.420 --> 09:20.285
that he has _
our full cooperation.

09:20.340 --> 09:23.639
The sooner he can finish
hIS IanIry, the sooner

09:23.690 --> 09:25.294
we can all
put this behind us.

09:25.340 --> 09:28.298
All right, then. Let me start
getting you what you need.
Good.

09:33.130 --> 09:34.734
JASON:
Ray.

09:34.790 --> 09:36.655
Ray, look at me. Hey.

09:36.700 --> 09:38.213
It's not your fault, all right?

09:38.270 --> 09:39.612
War's messy. I mean,

09:39.660 --> 09:41.309
could've happened to
any of us, right?

09:41.360 --> 09:42.918
Right.
Right?

09:42.970 --> 09:44.392
If you say so.
All right, look at.

09:44.450 --> 09:46.008
Whatever happened,
it's on all of us.

09:46.060 --> 09:47.140
I'm the one that killed
that kid, Jason.

09:47.190 --> 09:48.532
I don't see it that way.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.753
And I know the guys don't
see it that way, either.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.587
We got you.

09:53.630 --> 09:55.586
Nothing to get.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.452
Ray.

10:00.510 --> 10:03.468
Got your back.

10:03.510 --> 10:05.501
Copy that.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.782
The client has agreed
to pay in cash.

10:18.830 --> 10:21.082
Okay, all right.
Took him long enough.

10:21.140 --> 10:22.437
He's careful_.
Wouldn't even discuss

10:22.490 --> 10:24.299
the idea of a face-to-face.

10:24.360 --> 10:26.442
Took us this long to get him
to agree to a live drop.

10:26.490 --> 10:27.661
Where's the drop?

10:27.710 --> 10:29.223
Azahrin Spice Market.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.180
4:00 this afternoon.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.926
Y'all know
he's gonna send a courier.
MANDY: Probably, but you know

10:33.980 --> 10:35.368
how this works.
Roll him up,

10:35.410 --> 10:37.321
get him to give us
the next guy up the ladder.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.156
Sooner or later, it's gonna come
to the son of a bitch

10:39.200 --> 10:40.804
that put a hit out on Echo guys.

10:40.850 --> 10:43.580
Let's go get him.
Yeah.

10:45.810 --> 10:48.074
Ray Yeah.
Right.

11:07.230 --> 11:08.788
The Azahrin Spice Market,
as promised.

11:08.840 --> 11:11.707
The drop zone is here.
After he makes the drop,

11:11.750 --> 11:13.923
he's most likely
gonna exit here.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.528
All right, look,
if it's not too crowded,

11:15.580 --> 11:18.014
we might be able to get
a scooby van in. That's tight.

11:18.060 --> 11:19.664
How many civilians
you think'll be on the ground?

11:19.720 --> 11:22.757
4:00 in the afternoon?
A lot, I'd imagine.

11:22.810 --> 11:26.029
Well, that definitely works
in the guy's favor, right?

11:26.070 --> 11:28.459
Harder to spot the courier,
harder to follow.

11:28.510 --> 11:31.684
CLAY:
Yeah, but also harder for
him to spot us following.

11:31.730 --> 11:33.721
We don't need to follow him.
JASON:
What are you thinking there,

11:33.780 --> 11:35.987
Sonny?
Use Ray and Khalid

11:36.040 --> 11:38.201
as spotters, have 'em
blend in to the market.

11:38.260 --> 11:41.479
The rest of us will be out
of sight in the scooby van.

11:41.520 --> 11:44.648
Once Ray and Khalid ID. the
money guy, we'll swarm on him,

11:44.700 --> 11:46.520
and we'll have him flexcuffed
on the van floor

11:46.570 --> 11:48.299
before anybody knows
we're in the market.

11:48.350 --> 11:50.875
§%~;\\ J
ﬁg

11:50.920 --> 11:52.399
If Sonny's gonna start doing all
the op plans, then I'm gonna...

11:52.450 --> 11:55.055
I'm gonna need
a request a transfer.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.751
I have hidden gifts
there, Mr. Spenser.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.404
All right, any objections?

11:59.450 --> 12:00.883
You know he definitely is gonna
have a guy on overwatch.

12:00.930 --> 12:02.488
ERIC:
That's possible.

12:02.540 --> 12:04.929
That's why we need to get in
and out of there double-quick.

12:04.980 --> 12:06.368
This could work, Sonny.

12:09.030 --> 12:11.157
Hey?

12:11.200 --> 12:12.599
Yeah.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.767
How's he holding up?
Is he okay?

12:16.340 --> 12:18.592
Yeah. He's fine.
All right.

12:18.650 --> 12:21.995
How youholding up?
I'm fine, too.

12:22.040 --> 12:24.474
All good, okay?
All right.

12:31.880 --> 12:34.348
Mm.
Hey, what's going on?

12:34.400 --> 12:36.129
You're not gonna believe
what I found.
All right, just slow down.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.317
You're gonna choke
on your sandwich, all right?
Okay.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.669
The drill you gave me to check
out, belonged to your friend?

12:40.710 --> 12:43.144
Wait.

12:44.320 --> 12:47.232
All right.
All right.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.975
So my guys in Germany
got back to me.

12:49.020 --> 12:50.897
Guess what they found on it.

12:50.940 --> 12:53.283
Something more
than your basic Afghan dirt?

12:53.330 --> 12:55.639
Does basic Afghan dirt have
a lanthanum concentration

12:55.680 --> 12:57.636
of over 500 parts
per million?

12:57.680 --> 12:59.500
All right, let
me back up.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.983
Lanthanum is a
rare

13:02.040 --> 13:03.905
Uh, it's used in
all kinds of stuff,

13:03.950 --> 13:05.679
like from
telescopes, cameras,

13:05.740 --> 13:08.425
especially anything with
a rechargeable battery.

13:08.480 --> 13:12.120
Anything?
Yeah, from, like,
laptops to hybrid cars.

13:12.180 --> 13:13.875
Right.
So you can
imagine the value.

13:13.920 --> 13:15.956
Phew.
And where'd you say your
friend was poking around?

13:16.010 --> 13:17.830
Under poppy fields?
Irrigation tunnels.

13:17.880 --> 13:19.836
Right. So my guess is,

13:19.880 --> 13:22.269
there's got to be a huge
lanthanum deposit down there.

13:22.320 --> 13:23.662
I mean, it wouldn't surprise me.

13:23.710 --> 13:25.098
This country's
supposed to be loaded

13:25.150 --> 13:26.799
with rare

13:26.840 --> 13:28.489
Problem is,
they can't stop fighting

13:28.540 --> 13:30.496
long enough to actually
mount a mining operation.

13:30.540 --> 13:32.496
So if somebody
got this drill bit tested,

13:32.550 --> 13:34.063
and they're saying
that it came back

13:34.110 --> 13:35.975
just your basic Afghan dirt?

13:36.030 --> 13:38.806
Well, then, they're idiots,
or they're lying, or both.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.940
Is everything okay?

13:42.990 --> 13:45.902
Yeah. Just keep this
between us, okay?

13:45.950 --> 13:47.998
Yeah. Oh.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.184
3:232 :%€
515? 7.
9.42;? g;

14:04.230 --> 14:06.312
You okay?
Why?

14:06.360 --> 14:07.884
Guy looking
into your past work.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.886
Could put a lesser man
on edge.

14:09.930 --> 14:11.488
Thank God...

14:13.980 --> 14:15.459
...I'm not a lesser man.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.896
Ray?

14:18.940 --> 14:21.545
I'm fine.

14:21.590 --> 14:23.285
You forgot your comms earpiece
in the TOC.

14:34.780 --> 14:36.862
Hey, it happens.

14:36.910 --> 14:39.390
Not to him.

14:39.440 --> 14:41.908
Guy's got a six-month-old
little boy at home, you know?

14:41.960 --> 14:43.916
Gets showed a video of him

14:43.970 --> 14:46.700
killing somebody else's
kid accidentally.

14:46.750 --> 14:48.798
That's enough to mess
with anybody's head.

14:48.840 --> 14:52.401
Yeah. If you say so.

15:48.770 --> 15:51.204
We're in position
with good eyes on the drop spot.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.299
Stand by.

15:54.340 --> 15:56.160
JASON:
Good copy, Bravo 2.

15:56.210 --> 15:58.075
Snatch team standing by.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.451
Ray, moped.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.149
Calm down. I got him.

16:28.720 --> 16:32.156
TOC, guy on a moped
making his second

16:32.200 --> 16:33.849
circle around the fountain.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.595
Could be our guy.

16:35.640 --> 16:40.339
Roger, Bravo 2. ISR has got eyes
on the moped driver.

16:44.910 --> 16:47.515
My view is blocked.
I can't see what he's doing.

16:55.100 --> 16:57.568
He appears to be
kicking at something.

16:57.620 --> 16:59.611
Could be trying to
kick-start his bike.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.717
That's him. Moped driver's
making the drop.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.068
G0, 90, 90: 90: 90-

17:11.110 --> 17:12.452
Punch it!

17:26.650 --> 17:28.777
Go! Go! I
Go! socio'

17:28.830 --> 17:31.390
TOC, this is Bravo 1.
Target secure. We're moving.

17:40.840 --> 17:42.489
Shut up!

17:42.530 --> 17:44.748
He's, uh, he's saying
that somebody gave him

17:44.800 --> 17:47.439
20 American dollars if he
leaves this bag by the fountain.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.798
He's never seen the guy
before in his life.

17:49.850 --> 17:51.238
Boss?
Yeah.

17:53.150 --> 17:55.584
He doesn't look like anyone
we've rolled up before.

17:55.630 --> 17:57.325
No, he's not a true believer.

17:57.380 --> 17:58.938
Yeah?

17:58.990 --> 18:01.072
Found smokes on him.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.588
Hey, I think
you guys should see this.

18:03.640 --> 18:05.244
We were right
about the overwatch.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.860
Look, this is a video
of the takedown. Look up

18:07.910 --> 18:10.162
at the balcony.
ERIC:
Yeah. What are they doing?

18:10.210 --> 18:11.734
They're watching the drop.

18:11.780 --> 18:13.259
Maybe waiting for Abu Ali?

18:13.300 --> 18:15.689
I don't know.
Hold on a second.

18:15.740 --> 18:18.789
Bravo 1, we may have found
somebody watching the drop,

18:18.830 --> 18:20.479
making sure
that payment got through.

18:20.530 --> 18:22.566
JASON:
Any chance you recognize him?

18:22.620 --> 18:25.748
DAVIS: Oh, my God.
Tell me that is not who

18:25.800 --> 18:27.313
I think it is.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.100
We may have something.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.237
MANDY:
Hamid Gul Baladur.

18:38.290 --> 18:41.157
Yeah. We still believe
Baladur's the number two guy

18:41.200 --> 18:43.020
in the entire Halani network?

18:43.070 --> 18:46.028
Yep.
Okay. So Nouri Halani
put the hit on Salim?

18:46.080 --> 18:48.503
Baladur's always been
an order-taker.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.857
If he organized the Salim hit,

18:49.910 --> 18:51.684
it's because
the Halanis told him to.

18:51.730 --> 18:54.164
It means that they're probably
behind the hit on Echo Team.

18:54.220 --> 18:55.608
Either way, we got one
of our biggest fish

18:55.650 --> 18:56.992
finally sticking
his head out in a place

18:57.040 --> 18:58.689
where we can reach out
and touch him.

18:58.740 --> 19:00.560
When's the last time Baladur
was seen outside the Tribals?

19:00.610 --> 19:02.168
Been years.

19:02.220 --> 19:04.484
Which is why we should be
so eager to catch up with him

19:04.530 --> 19:06.225
before he gets back
in the Tribals.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.875
Bravo 1, I need you
back here ASAP.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.091
We got a new target.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.023
Hamid Gul Baladur,
friend and protector

19:22.070 --> 19:24.061
to those
who serve the Halani network.

19:24.110 --> 19:25.850
Death to everyone else.

19:25.900 --> 19:27.856
He's masterminded
a number of hits

19:27.900 --> 19:29.629
against journalists,
Afghan officials

19:29.690 --> 19:31.635
and coalition forces.

19:31.690 --> 19:33.203
Nouri Halani is the man
in charge.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.206
He's descended

19:35.260 --> 19:38.218
from a long line of warlords
who've controlled large

19:38.260 --> 19:40.865
swaths of Nangarhar, Paktia
and Khost provinces

19:40.910 --> 19:43.253
for most of the last
few hundred years.

19:43.310 --> 19:47.428
His father was a key US. ally,
killed by the Soviets in '86.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.391
Now Under Nouri's leadership,
the Halani network

19:50.450 --> 19:52.520
works mostly like
a crime family.

19:52.580 --> 19:55.879
They collect protection money
from local businesses,

19:55.930 --> 19:57.488
especially poppy
cultivation.

19:57.540 --> 19:59.883
What about the
younger brother?
Abad Halani.

19:59.930 --> 20:01.534
He grew up
in his older brother's shadow.

20:01.590 --> 20:03.546
He's reportedly
an indecisive leader,

20:03.590 --> 20:05.717
a drinker, and even
somewhat of a womanizer.

20:05.760 --> 20:09.196
Oh, should have sent him to
Vegas, and had Moe Greene

20:09.250 --> 20:10.501
sort him out.

20:10.550 --> 20:11.938
Hmm?

20:11.990 --> 20:13.855
Fredo Corleone?

20:13.900 --> 20:16.243
Michael sent him
to work at the casinos?

20:16.300 --> 20:17.904
Come on.

20:17.950 --> 20:21.943
"He was banging the cocktail
waitress, two at a time."

20:22.000 --> 20:24.992
Okay, it's actually not
a-a terrible analogy.
Come on. Thank you.

20:25.040 --> 20:26.917
If the Halanis_are
a crime family,

20:26.960 --> 20:28.780
then Baladur's the consigliere.

20:28.830 --> 20:31.390
Makes sense that Nouri'd use him
to set up the hit on Salim.

20:31.440 --> 20:33.260
And Echo Team.

20:33.310 --> 20:34.527
Starting to see a pattern here.

20:34.580 --> 20:36.309
MANDY:
Remember, the Halanis

20:36.360 --> 20:38.134
might have had reasons
to want Salim dead

20:38.190 --> 20:39.703
that had nothing to
do with Echo Team.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.443
At least superficially,

20:41.500 --> 20:43.309
this guy was getting pretty
buddy-buddy with our side.

20:43.370 --> 20:46.885
No, no, no. They killed him
because they knew we were about

20:46.940 --> 20:49.158
to grab him for
the Echo hit.
TheirEcho hit.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.327
No, we don't know that.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.848
And if we kill Baladur,
we might never know.

20:53.900 --> 20:55.504
Which is why we're
gonna take him alive.

20:55.550 --> 20:58.769
Yeah, it might be easier said
than done. Davis?

21:03.650 --> 21:05.868
Suicide belt.

21:05.910 --> 21:08.515
Legend has it Baladur
never takes it off.

21:08.570 --> 21:10.049
So the guy'd rather
get blown all the way

21:10.090 --> 21:11.478
to hell and back
than get taken alive.

21:11.530 --> 21:12.736
Well, it sort of
makes it his call.

21:12.790 --> 21:14.394
No, it doesn't.
Not necessarily.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.396
If we want to get information
from a suicide bomber,

21:16.440 --> 21:19.000
there's one technique
we would use to take him alive.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.664
Yeah, but you need three guys
to take him down:

21:20.710 --> 21:23.053
two to hold the arms,
one to choke him out.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.239
Which means getting awful close
to a guy with a bomb belt.

21:25.280 --> 21:27.271
Yes, it does.
MANDY: Let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.060
At the moment, Baladur
is still in the wind.

21:29.110 --> 21:32.068
Okay, so we still have
the sniper's phone.

21:32.110 --> 21:34.635
Right.
Right? Okay, so why don't

21:34.680 --> 21:36.728
we text Baladur and tell him
we want another meet?

21:36.770 --> 21:38.192
It's gonna be a little bit
of a hard sell,

21:38.250 --> 21:40.810
because the last one was a trap.

21:40.860 --> 21:44.421
All right, look. Baladur thinks
that All set him up.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.552
Right? So why don't
we just flip it?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.909
Have the sniper
accuse Baladur

21:48.950 --> 21:50.998
of being the guy behind
the setup.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.691
I mean, all Baladur knows is
that the Americans were there.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.393
Hell of a long shot.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.953
What do we have to lose?

22:05.410 --> 22:07.093
NAIMA :
Baby, you'll get past this.

22:07.150 --> 22:08.401
It's not your fault.

22:08.450 --> 22:10.099
No. I threw that grenade.

22:10.150 --> 22:11.276
It was an accident.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.536
RAY:
That boy who died,

22:12.590 --> 22:14.751
he had nothing to do
with any of it.

22:14.810 --> 22:16.584
One second he's playing
with his dad, and...

22:16.630 --> 22:18.769
NAIMA:
Well, what does Jason say?

22:18.810 --> 22:20.596
What do you think he says?

22:20.640 --> 22:22.119
It's nobody's fault, it's war.

22:22.160 --> 22:25.288
Things happen.
Well, it is and they do.

22:25.340 --> 22:27.296
It doesn't matter
what he says, aanay.

22:27.340 --> 22:29.331
CID wants to find
the serviceman responsible

22:29.390 --> 22:32.291
for killing some kid,
that's what they're gonna find.

22:32.350 --> 22:34.250
But you didn't do
anything wrong.
I know I didn't.

22:34.300 --> 22:35.699
Why does everybody
keep saying that to me?

22:35.740 --> 22:37.731
What is going on, Raymond?

22:37.790 --> 22:39.394
What do you mean?

22:39.440 --> 22:40.953
Raymond Perry,

22:41.010 --> 22:43.137
just 'cause there's 7,000 miles
between us,

22:43.180 --> 22:45.398
doesn't mean I can't tell_
when you're hiding something.

22:45.450 --> 22:46.439
Naima...

22:46.490 --> 22:49.402
What are you not telling me?

22:49.450 --> 22:51.406
It's nothing.
It's just...

22:51.450 --> 22:53.236
my shoulder's
been hurting a little.

22:53.280 --> 22:55.236
Oh, my God.
And when I threw that frag,

22:55.280 --> 22:57.271
if my shoulder wasn't messed up,

22:57.330 --> 22:59.059
I make that throw,
that boy'd still be alive.

22:59.110 --> 23:01.897
Ray, listen to me. Who else
knows you deployed hurt?

23:01.940 --> 23:04.852
That you never went to see
a doctor to get clearance?

23:04.900 --> 23:06.379
No one.
Good.

23:06.420 --> 23:08.376
That's how you keep it.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.034
I can't lie to CID, Naima.

23:10.080 --> 23:11.422
Yes, you can.

23:11.470 --> 23:13.381
You are in a war, Ray.

23:13.430 --> 23:16.035
You are risking your life
every second.

23:16.090 --> 23:19.469
You are a hero, and whatever
happened on that roof,

23:19.520 --> 23:21.397
you can't let them
take that away from you.

23:21.440 --> 23:23.829
You will not mention
your shoulder.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.269
You've got to look out for
yourself 'cause I'm not there

23:26.310 --> 23:29.222
to do it for you.

23:29.270 --> 23:31.090
Tell me you understand, baby.

23:32.970 --> 23:34.403
Yeah.

23:34.450 --> 23:36.054
Kiss the kids for me, okay?

23:36.110 --> 23:38.715
And you didn't tell Jason?

23:40.240 --> 23:42.196
No.

23:42.240 --> 23:44.196
I love you.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.196
I love you, too.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.673
Bye, baby.

24:04.050 --> 24:07.611
Still no answer
from Baladur?

24:10.180 --> 24:11.738
Think he's done with us?

24:11.790 --> 24:13.963
Could be he's checking
with the Halanis

24:14.010 --> 24:15.614
for his next move.

24:15.670 --> 24:17.661
You mind if I get

24:17.710 --> 24:19.701
a hit of this coffee?
I'm a little tired.

24:19.760 --> 24:23.196
You know, sleep is not
a sign of weakness.

24:24.410 --> 24:25.934
I'll be damned.

24:25.980 --> 24:27.493
Well.

24:27.550 --> 24:29.450
He's saying
he didn't set us up.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.853
Tell him...

24:31.900 --> 24:34.152
tell him that he's got
to prove it, all right?

24:34.210 --> 24:36.849
Tell him that he's got to bring
you your money in person.

24:36.910 --> 24:38.514
Okay.

24:48.090 --> 24:51.560
MANDY: He wants to know why
he should come in person.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.999
Well, to prove that
it's not a setup.

24:59.450 --> 25:01.702
MANDY: "If you're there,
you can't summon the Americans,

25:01.760 --> 25:04.183
because they'll arrest you,
too."

25:07.150 --> 25:09.755
"What makes you think the
Americans would arrest me?

25:09.810 --> 25:11.584
You don't even know who I am."

25:11.640 --> 25:14.200
Sure we do.

25:16.810 --> 25:19.768
You are awful sly sometimes.

25:19.820 --> 25:21.515
JASON: Well, you know what?
I have my moments.

25:21.560 --> 25:23.073
What did you say?

25:23.130 --> 25:27.419
"I know you very well,
Hamid Gul Baladur."

25:27.480 --> 25:29.300
Good. Let him chew on that.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.008
We're back on.

25:36.050 --> 25:37.654
See that?
We're back on.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.661
Baladur wants to meet at a
tea house off of 40 Meter Road.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.585
It's a relatively
low traffic area,

25:49.630 --> 25:52.019
and there's only one entrance
as far as we know.

25:52.070 --> 25:53.753
Well, we got to snatch him
outside of the building

25:53.810 --> 25:55.368
before he goes inside
the building,

25:55.420 --> 25:57.024
because he's got on an S-belt.

25:57.070 --> 25:59.595
My guess is Baladur is looking
to kill the sniper.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.551
It's the only reason he's not
already back in the Tribals.

26:01.600 --> 26:03.852
So...?

26:03.910 --> 26:06.162
So he's got to figure
Ali's looking to take
the same shot at him.

26:06.210 --> 26:07.859
Yeah, he's probably worried
about getting his ass shot off

26:07.910 --> 26:09.298
on his way in,

26:09.350 --> 26:10.738
so he's probably
gonna stay out of sight

26:10.780 --> 26:12.828
until he positive I.D.s Ali.

26:12.870 --> 26:14.735
Okay, so where
does that put us?

26:14.790 --> 26:16.655
I mean, 'cause the last time
I checked, old Ali

26:16.700 --> 26:19.351
didn't really seem like he was
in the mood to be drinking tea.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.573
So we send in a decoy.

26:28.540 --> 26:29.791
How you doing?

26:31.670 --> 26:33.581
You might want to
roll those back down.

26:33.630 --> 26:35.621
I think that's the way
All was wearing his.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.022
You sure?
Yep.

26:37.070 --> 26:39.106
Good lookin' out.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.060
And for today's mission,

26:41.120 --> 26:43.759
Raymond Perry is
bringing sew back

26:43.810 --> 26:45.550
with the Syrian
sniper look.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.682
Okay, Sonny. You might want to
get your ass on the bus.

26:47.730 --> 26:49.686
Roger that.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.511
Hey, I want to
tell you something.

26:53.560 --> 26:55.425
I look really hot
as a paid assassin?

26:55.480 --> 26:56.959
Well, there is that, yes.

26:58.440 --> 27:01.261
No, about what's going on.

27:01.310 --> 27:02.914
I can handle it, Davis.

27:02.960 --> 27:04.655
I really can.

27:04.710 --> 27:09.579
Okay, but CID can make your life
miserable if they want to.

27:09.620 --> 27:11.053
One time I supplied
a dozen bridging ladders

27:11.100 --> 27:12.749
to some_Marines
training in Qatar,

27:12.800 --> 27:15.268
a couple of them fell apart
when they were extended.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.322
We're talking three or four
broken bones, that's it.

27:17.370 --> 27:19.326
The Navy investigators
came after me

27:19.370 --> 27:21.497
like I had personally
sabotaged those ladders.

27:21.550 --> 27:25.452
All I'm saying
is be careful.

27:25.510 --> 27:27.978
And all I'm saying is
is I can handle it.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.983
But thanks.

27:39.480 --> 27:42.381
Hey. Listen, Ray.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.783
Look, I know we want to
bring this guy in alive,

27:44.830 --> 27:46.741
but I don't need anybody doing
anything stupid out there.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.133
All right? This guy
is wearing an S-belt.

27:49.180 --> 27:51.489
If he's hell-bent on
going out in a bang,

27:51.530 --> 27:54.488
then you stand back
and you let him.

27:54.540 --> 27:55.962
All right?

27:56.020 --> 27:57.317
Roger that.

27:57.370 --> 27:59.361
All right.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.689
JASON:
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.685
We're in position
across from the tea house.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.731
We got eyes on the door.

28:22.780 --> 28:24.259
You are good to go.

28:24.310 --> 28:26.175
Nothing on ISR so far.

28:26.220 --> 28:28.211
Bravo 2, on you.

28:28.270 --> 28:30.568
Switching to
text communication only.

28:30.620 --> 28:32.872
Roger. On the move.

28:44.110 --> 28:45.407
He looks convincing.

28:45.460 --> 28:47.928
Yeah, let's hope so,
right?

28:54.420 --> 28:55.762
As-salaam alaikum.

28:55.820 --> 28:57.026
Wa alaikum as-salaam.

29:24.488 --> 29:24.540
Hey, Bravo 1, this is TOC.

29:24.540 --> 29:25.973
Ray is at the right-hand

29:26.020 --> 29:28.625
rear table.

29:42.860 --> 29:44.942
He said there's not a lot
of friendly faces in there.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.991
Maybe seven or eight men.

30:14.550 --> 30:16.541
He says the guy across from him
is sending a text.

30:16.590 --> 30:19.411
He could be telling
Baladur the meet's on.

30:19.460 --> 30:20.802
Be my guess.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.128
Where the hell is this guy?

30:28.170 --> 30:29.467
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

30:29.520 --> 30:31.033
Any updates?

30:31.090 --> 30:32.603
Still nothing on our end.

30:32.650 --> 30:34.561
Guy's got
to show up soon.

30:34.610 --> 30:36.475
For all he knows, Abu Ali
is in there waiting,

30:36.530 --> 30:38.395
getting madder by the minute.

30:41.620 --> 30:44.180
Bravo 1, he's got eyes
on Baladur.

30:44.230 --> 30:45.652
How'd he get inside?

30:45.710 --> 30:46.961
Bravo 1, be advised.

30:47.010 --> 30:48.147
The target is inside
the building.

30:48.190 --> 30:49.054
Must've been tunnels.

30:49.100 --> 30:51.239
TOC, we're preparing to engage.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.713
ERIC:
Negative. Tell them to hold.

30:52.760 --> 30:53.795
We're not charging
into an S-belt.

30:53.850 --> 30:55.886
DAVIS:
All call signs hold.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.322
SONNY:
Come on, Ray.

31:23.310 --> 31:25.835
Abu Ali?

31:36.540 --> 31:37.848
Go, go.

32:03.530 --> 32:04.212
Ray!

32:04.270 --> 32:05.692
Over here.

32:05.740 --> 32:06.820
Chest plate caught it.

32:06.880 --> 32:08.825
Baladur squirted. I'm good.

32:08.880 --> 32:09.960
JASON:
TOC, Bravo 2's okay.

32:10.010 --> 32:11.739
No sign of Baladur.

32:11.790 --> 32:13.701
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

32:15.450 --> 32:18.362
Come on, come on, come on.
Got him.

32:18.410 --> 32:20.059
He's two doors down,
exiting north side.

32:20.110 --> 32:21.407
JASON:
Copy that.

32:21.460 --> 32:22.973
Sonny, Brock,
lock this place down.

32:23.020 --> 32:25.068
Clay, Derek, on me.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.544
SONNY:
This is Bravo 3.

32:27.590 --> 32:30.468
1, 6, and Alpha 2
are in pursuit of the squirter.

32:30.510 --> 32:31.465
You okay?

32:31.510 --> 32:32.636
Yeah, I'm good, brother.

32:34.510 --> 32:37.070
Go that way.
See if you can cut him off.

33:01.320 --> 33:02.571
What is he doing?
Why isn't he shooting?

33:02.630 --> 33:04.325
MANDY: He's trying to
take him alive.

33:14.290 --> 33:15.507
All call signs,

33:15.550 --> 33:17.199
Bravo 1 has engaged.

33:33.960 --> 33:35.518
Don't let him pull the belt.

33:35.570 --> 33:36.559
Get his left arm.

33:37.530 --> 33:39.395
Can you get 'em?

33:41.580 --> 33:42.968
Got it?

33:43.020 --> 33:44.408
Boom.
Okay. That's good.

33:44.450 --> 33:46.532
Get this big son of a bitch
off me, will you?

33:56.680 --> 33:58.932
Thanks.

34:01.690 --> 34:04.204
I know you're from Pakistan.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.639
I know you speak English.

34:06.690 --> 34:08.908
I know who you work for.

34:08.950 --> 34:11.953
Nouri Halani.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.004
Your boss is gonna wonder
how we caught you.

34:17.050 --> 34:18.438
Even if you get out
of here--

34:18.490 --> 34:20.299
which you
probably won't--

34:20.360 --> 34:23.523
hernever_
trust you again.

34:25.490 --> 34:27.572
Baladur,

34:27.630 --> 34:29.404
the man known as Death,

34:29.450 --> 34:31.918
has been captured.

34:31.980 --> 34:35.973
So maybe I do let you out
of here, let them

34:36.030 --> 34:38.760
pick you up on the side
of the road, let them know

34:38.810 --> 34:41.984
you were broken
by the Americans.

34:42.030 --> 34:45.591
By a woman.

34:45.640 --> 34:49.292
You think you know
what you're fighting here.

34:49.340 --> 34:51.126
But, believe me...

34:51.170 --> 34:54.037
you don't.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.865
What does that mean?

35:00.480 --> 35:02.869
What's that mean?

35:11.840 --> 35:14.968
You couldn't even send yourself
to heaven.

35:15.020 --> 35:18.626
Now you have to sit here,
with all of us,

35:18.680 --> 35:22.241
for as long as we want.

35:36.220 --> 35:38.029
Hello.

35:38.090 --> 35:41.173
When you said you wanted
to come by and talk,

35:41.220 --> 35:43.085
I thought that was something
that people say.

35:43.140 --> 35:45.483
Can I come in?

35:45.530 --> 35:47.304
Yeah, come in.

35:54.410 --> 35:56.446
Let me guess, you're going back
with your wife.

35:56.500 --> 35:59.196
No. Why don't you guess again.
You can tell me. I'm a big girl.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.844
And it's my... it's
my fault anyways

36:00.890 --> 36:03.279
for breaking my "no
married guy" rule.
Amy, stop.

36:03.330 --> 36:04.888
Okay? Stop.
You know what this is about.

36:04.940 --> 36:07.636
No, I actually don't know
what this is about.

36:07.680 --> 36:09.671
You remember this?

36:09.730 --> 36:12.335
This drill bit?
Steve Porter's drill bit?

36:12.380 --> 36:15.725
Remember you had it tested
by your

36:15.780 --> 36:18.340
And it came back
as your basic Afghan dirt.

36:18.390 --> 36:20.517
You remember that?
I remember that.

36:20.560 --> 36:21.902
Well, I had it tested again.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.609
Okay.

36:23.650 --> 36:25.208
Lanthanum.
Do you know what that is?

36:25.270 --> 36:27.522
Enlighten me.

36:27.570 --> 36:29.003
It's a rare-earth metal.

36:29.050 --> 36:30.915
Used in high-tech stuff.

36:30.970 --> 36:33.438
It's worth a fortune.

36:35.410 --> 36:38.277
So either you lied to me
or your lab guys lied to me.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.276
I didn't lie to you.
I didn't lie to you.

36:40.320 --> 36:41.309
I didn't lie
to Steve.

36:41.370 --> 36:42.667
I wouldn't do that.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.676
Your company does
mining operations, right?
Yes.

36:44.720 --> 36:46.233
Your boss, Cutter,

36:46.290 --> 36:49.248
S.A.S. badass turned, uh,
contractor millionaire.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.281
How much do you really know
about him?

36:51.330 --> 36:53.673
Okay.

36:53.730 --> 36:55.243
You can go now.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.598
I-I appreciate you stopping by.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.995
This stuff is worth
a lot of money, Amy.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.869
People do a lot of funny things
when it comes to money.

37:04.910 --> 37:06.514
I don't know.

37:06.570 --> 37:09.300
Maybe, uh, murder
a bunch of operators.

37:26.540 --> 37:28.849
Ithought
disinformation campaigns

37:28.890 --> 37:30.846
went out of style
in the '605.

37:30.900 --> 37:34.279
Well, that's awfully
naive of you.
You lied to me.

37:34.330 --> 37:36.503
First day
of secret agent school,

37:36.550 --> 37:39.769
they tell us never to
answer a vague accusation.

37:39.820 --> 37:43.904
You think this is funny?
I think you're gonna have to be
a little bit more specific.

37:43.950 --> 37:47.295
The sniper who shot Salim Hakan
was killed at the scene.

37:47.350 --> 37:49.250
Three days ago.
Yesterday, you told me

37:49.310 --> 37:51.039
you believed
he was still alive.

37:51.090 --> 37:52.341
Yes.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.958
That's all you're gonna say?

37:54.010 --> 37:56.695
I gave you gold. I gave
you stuff nobody else had.

37:56.750 --> 37:58.570
I gave you the sniper's name,
his bio...

37:58.620 --> 37:59.746
So I'm not supposed to be mad

37:59.790 --> 38:02.054
because most of what you told me
was true?

38:02.100 --> 38:03.749
The guys who hired the sniper
are the same guys

38:03.800 --> 38:06.098
who blew up Echo Team.
Only way to get to them

38:06.150 --> 38:08.926
was have them believe
the sniper was still alive.

38:08.980 --> 38:11.278
It's my job to
make that happen.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.412
You could've used
another reporter.
Well, I used you.

38:13.460 --> 38:14.939
To publish your lie.

38:14.980 --> 38:16.936
There's that word again.
What do you call it?

38:16.990 --> 38:19.117
My job.
Yeah

38:19.160 --> 38:22.891
A journalist trades
on his credibility.

38:22.950 --> 38:25.339
Not only did you get me
to report fake news,

38:25.390 --> 38:27.255
you made me look
like I'm carrying water

38:27.300 --> 38:30.258
for the US. military, which a
lot of people are already primed

38:30.300 --> 38:32.165
to believe because
of who my father is.

38:32.220 --> 38:33.994
It has taken me years

38:34.050 --> 38:36.655
to build a reputation
as a truth-teller.

38:36.700 --> 38:39.692
Well, you'll understand
if I'm less concerned

38:39.750 --> 38:41.615
about preserving
your reputation

38:41.660 --> 38:45.096
than I am about finding justice
for our dead operators.

38:46.360 --> 38:47.793
Mission first.
Damn right.

38:49.500 --> 38:52.321
Before friendship.

38:52.370 --> 38:55.271
Before anything.

38:58.900 --> 39:01.243
I feel sorry for you.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.266
That was wild.

40:04.310 --> 40:05.868
What's that?

40:05.920 --> 40:07.876
Didn't I hear somebody
say you need at least

40:07.920 --> 40:09.876
three guys to take down a man
with an S

40:09.920 --> 40:11.876
I didn't have
three guys.

40:11.930 --> 40:14.057
That's not happening.

40:14.100 --> 40:16.056
Blackburn's pretty angry with
you for taking such a big risk.

40:16.100 --> 40:19.536
Huh. Yeah. I know.

40:19.590 --> 40:21.933
He laid into me
during the AAR. I got it.

40:21.980 --> 40:24.676
So, Baladur, is he talking?

40:24.720 --> 40:26.676
Mm, not really.

40:26.720 --> 40:29.598
No surprise,
hard-core guy like that.

40:29.640 --> 40:31.460
You think you'll be able
to break him?

40:31.510 --> 40:33.819
Maybe. But even
if we can't,

40:33.860 --> 40:36.647
his capture's gonna be
a big blow to Nouri Halani.

40:36.690 --> 40:39.682
Guy spent the last 17 years
thinking he's untouchable.

40:39.740 --> 40:41.253
All of a sudden, we
roll up his number two?

40:41.300 --> 40:42.733
You think he's gonna panic?

40:42.780 --> 40:44.213
Figure he's gonna do something.

40:44.260 --> 40:46.956
We just have to be ready
to take advantage when he does.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.480
Yeah.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.839
Listen, you know anything
about these rare

40:51.880 --> 40:54.098
Uh, lanthanum or whatever?

40:54.140 --> 40:56.051
Only what I read
in the paper.

40:56.100 --> 40:58.489
Afghanistan is
sitting on a...

40:58.540 --> 41:00.314
billion dollars' worth
of it or something?

41:00.370 --> 41:01.576
Trillions, I believe.

41:01.630 --> 41:03.666
Okay.
The world's
crazy enough

41:03.720 --> 41:05.108
for someone to slit your throat

41:05.150 --> 41:07.061
for a couple bucks out
of your wallet;

41:07.110 --> 41:09.158
can only imagine
what they would do

41:09.200 --> 41:10.758
to get a piece
of that trillion, huh?

41:10.810 --> 41:12.198
Where are you
going with this?

41:12.250 --> 41:15.242
Hey. Phone call for you.
Line four.

41:15.290 --> 41:16.632
You know who it is?

41:16.690 --> 41:18.078
It's a potential source,
maybe.

41:18.120 --> 41:19.678
Guy called the tip line,
said he had information

41:19.730 --> 41:22.198
about Salim's murder,
asked for you by name.

41:24.220 --> 41:26.211
Mm, can we trace it?
We're trying.

41:26.260 --> 41:27.739
Sounds like he's scrambling
his signal.

41:27.780 --> 41:29.213
We're recording, obviously.

41:32.310 --> 41:33.652
This is Amanda Ellis.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.349
This is Abad Halani.

41:35.400 --> 41:37.868
It's Abad Halani. Come here.

41:37.930 --> 41:41.536
First, I congratulate you on the
capture of Hamid Gul Baladur.

41:41.580 --> 41:44.185
I never thought
he could be taken alive.

41:44.240 --> 41:46.014
What makes you think
we have Baladur?

41:46.060 --> 41:48.881
Second, my brother,
Nouri Halani,

41:48.940 --> 41:52.364
is behind the killing
of General Salim Hakan.

41:52.420 --> 41:56.026
He is also the one who blew up
your commandos some weeks ago.

41:56.070 --> 41:58.538
Why are you telling me this?

41:58.600 --> 42:01.854
You want to impress me with
tales of your brother's power?

42:01.910 --> 42:03.298
No.

42:03.340 --> 42:05.388
I want to deliver him to you.
