- JOSHUA?
- CLICK-CLACK-CLACK,

09:18.766 --> 09:19.767
CLICK-CLACK-CLACK.

09:19.850 --> 09:22.019
- SLOW IT DOWN AND MAKE
A FEW ADJUSTMENTS HERE.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.230
- WE GOOD?

09:24.313 --> 09:26.107
- YEP.
- YOU SURE?

09:26.190 --> 09:27.108
{\an8}- LINE WORK IS EVERYTHING
IN A TATTOO.

09:27.191 --> 09:29.485
IT IS THE STRUCTURE
WHICH YOU BUILD FROM.

09:29.568 --> 09:33.197
IF ANYTHING THAT IS
THE SUPPORTING STRUCTURE

09:33.281 --> 09:36.033
IS WEAK, THE STRUCTURE FALLS,
JUST LIKE TATTOOING.

09:40.288 --> 09:43.499
- 30 MINUTES LEFT, EVERYBODY.
30 MINUTES TO GO.

09:43.582 --> 09:45.001
- LET ME SEE IF THAT WORKS.

09:45.084 --> 09:48.629
OH, I JUST BROKE IT.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.096
{\an8}- I'M FREAKING OUT.
IT'S SO EMBARRASSING.

09:58.764 --> 10:03.811
{\an8}[nails cracking]

10:06.731 --> 10:09.650
- FIVE MINUTES.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.069
- I BROKE MY COIL,
SO I HAVE TO PIGTAIL

10:12.153 --> 10:13.696
THIS WIRE BACK TOGETHER.

10:13.779 --> 10:14.780
I MORE OR LESS GOT THIS.

10:14.864 --> 10:18.367
I MEAN, THERE'S NO REASON
IT SHOULDN'T WORK NOW.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.830
DOESN'T WANT TO WORK.

10:22.913 --> 10:24.206
I DON'T KNOW.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.626
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN,

10:27.710 --> 10:31.547
SIX, FIVE, FOUR, THREE,

10:31.630 --> 10:34.175
TWO, ONE--TIME'S UP.

10:34.258 --> 10:38.012
MACHINES DOWN,
NO MORE INK.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.348
- THAT SHOULD DO IT, MAN.

10:40.431 --> 10:42.558
{\an8}THE WAY HIS ARM ENDS UP,
ALL MY STRAIGHT LINES

10:42.641 --> 10:44.143
{\an8}ARE NOW THESE,
LIKE, CURVED LINES.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.686
IT'S A [bleep] NIGHTMARE.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.730
I PUT MY MACHINE TOGETHER.
AT LEAST THAT'S SOMETHING.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.565
- SORRY.
- NO, THAT'S OKAY.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.900
- I AM VERY EMBARRASSED.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.069
{\an8}I HATE THE WORD,
"I CAN'T DO IT."

10:53.152 --> 10:55.571
I'M SO FRUSTRATED
AT THIS POINT.

10:55.654 --> 10:57.907
- I'M ACTUALLY SHOCKED
THAT TATU BABY FAILED AT THIS.

10:57.990 --> 11:00.034
{\an8}THIS IS SOMETHING EVERYBODY
SHOULD KNOW HOW TO DO.

11:00.117 --> 11:03.412
{\an8}[nail cracks]

11:04.538 --> 11:06.791
- TATU BABY,
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:06.874 --> 11:09.043
- IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE
I'VE PUT A MACHINE TOGETHER.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.920
IT DIDN'T TURN ON.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.255
- BEING A WELL-ROUNDED TATTOOER,
YOU HAVE TO KNOW YOUR EQUIPMENT.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.507
MAYBE IT'S TIME TO FOCUS
A LITTLE BIT MORE ENERGY

11:14.590 --> 11:16.675
ON KNOWING YOUR TOOLS.
- DEFINITELY.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.095
- YOU DO A LOT OF DIFFERENT
STYLE TATTOOS.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.389
KNOWING HOW TO WORK THIS MACHINE
AND KNOWING HOW TO TUNE IT,

11:21.472 --> 11:22.139
YOU COULD POTENTIALLY
DO A LOT BETTER TATTOOS

11:22.223 --> 11:24.100
IN THE LONG RUN.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.560
- THE WEAKNESS
HAS BEEN EXPOSED.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.645
- ALLY.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.605
- I DIDN'T GET THE MACHINE
PUT TOGETHER.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.565
- EITHER YOU KNOW YOUR CRAFT
OR YOU DON'T.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.692
BEING ABLE TO PUT
A MACHINE TOGETHER

11:32.775 --> 11:33.818
IS DEFINITELY
KNOWING YOUR CRAFT.

11:33.901 --> 11:36.946
{\an8}- NOT KNOWING HOW TO PUT
A TATTOO MACHINE TOGETHER

11:37.029 --> 11:38.030
{\an8}DOESN'T MEAN
I'M A BAD ARTIST.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.157
- BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING
FOR US TO CRITIQUE,

11:40.241 --> 11:42.743
YOU GOT TO BRING IN
SOME SOLID LINE WORK

11:42.827 --> 11:44.286
IN YOUR ELIMINATION TATTOO,

11:44.370 --> 11:46.288
IF, IN FACT,
YOU'RE STILL WITH US BY THEN.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.915
- OH, [bleep].

11:54.713 --> 11:55.548
- JASON.

11:55.631 --> 11:57.133
- TATTOO LOOKS SUPER CLEAN.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.134
THE LINES
HAVE ENOUGH DISTANCE

11:58.217 --> 11:59.009
SO THEY WON'T BLEED TOGETHER.

11:59.093 --> 12:00.636
- AND OBVIOUSLY,
YOU'RE PROFICIENT

12:00.719 --> 12:01.846
WITH YOUR TATTOO MACHINE.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.097
- I THINK I WAS ONE
OF THE FIRST

12:03.180 --> 12:04.598
TO GET MY MACHINE
PUT TOGETHER.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.225
- GOOD JOB.

12:06.308 --> 12:07.059
- ES.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.727
- OBVIOUSLY,
I DIDN'T FINISH IT.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.312
ONCE AGAIN,
I HAD THE TIME ISSUE.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.898
- NOT FINISHING YOUR TATTOOS,
IT'S GONNA HAUNT YOU SOON.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.150
- I'M HEARING IT.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.318
- JOSHUA, ANY TROUBLE
GETTING THIS MACHINE TOGETHER?

12:16.402 --> 12:17.862
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
VERY EXPERIENCED.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.905
- THE LINES AREN'T SUPER CLEAN,
AND IT'S A LITTLE CROOKED.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.866
THERE COULD BE A LOT MORE
VARIANCE IN THE LINE WEIGHT.

12:21.949 --> 12:23.993
- JESUS,
JOSH'S TATTOO SUCKS.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.454
{\an8}HE CAN'T FOLLOW
A STRAIGHT LINE.

12:26.537 --> 12:27.746
- KYLE.
- YOUR FLATNESS ON THE TOP

12:27.830 --> 12:30.541
AND THE BOTTOM AREN'T AS PRECISE
AS WE'D WANT TO SEE.

12:30.624 --> 12:34.336
YOU'VE JUST COME UP
A LITTLE SHORT.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.046
- CRAIG.
- IT REALLY SHOWS

12:36.130 --> 12:37.131
THAT THE MACHINE
WAS RUNNING RIGHT FOR YOU.

12:37.214 --> 12:40.009
YOU WERE ABLE TO USE
NOT ONLY VERY FINE LINES,

12:40.092 --> 12:41.302
BUT THICKER LINES.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.387
YOU SCULPTED OUT YOUR LETTERS
AND NUMBERS.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.181
THEY LOOK REALLY SUPER TIGHT.
- THANK YOU.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.724
- I WOULD LOVE TO SEE SOMETHING
THAT CRAIG CAN'T DO.

12:46.807 --> 12:50.060
{\an8}HE'S DEFINITELY
THE NUMBER-ONE RUNNER RIGHT NOW.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.188
- JACKIE.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.189
- IT'S DEFINITELY
A TOUGH SPOT TO WORK.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.065
YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE BIT
OF INCONSISTENCIES

12:55.149 --> 12:56.275
WITH KEEPING IT STRAIGHT.

12:56.358 --> 12:57.359
SOME OF THE LINES
IN THE BAR CODE

12:57.443 --> 12:58.277
LOOK LIKE THEY COME
A LITTLE BIT CLOSE TOGETHER

12:58.360 --> 13:01.238
TOWARDS THE BOTTOM.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.698
- JOEY.

13:02.781 --> 13:04.158
- A LITTLE BIT OF A TRICKY AREA
ON THE BACK OF THE NECK,

13:04.241 --> 13:06.744
BUT MAN, THIS TATTOO IS CLEAN,
IT'S SUPER TIGHT,

13:06.827 --> 13:08.704
AND THAT LETTERING
IS ALMOST FLAWLESS.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.080
- YOU GOT IT A LOT MORE SOLID

13:10.164 --> 13:11.540
THAN SOME OF THE OTHER PEOPLE
WE'VE SEEN.

13:11.624 --> 13:13.042
IT'S A GOOD JOB.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.544
- JIME.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.379
- IT LOOKS FLAT
ACROSS THE TOP AND THE BOTTOM

13:17.463 --> 13:18.756
AND THE NUMBERS
ARE SUPER CLEAN.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.299
- MAKING IT THAT NICE,
THAT SOLID,

13:20.382 --> 13:23.052
IT'S KIND OF LIKE YOU
SHOWED EVERYBODY WHAT'S UP.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.053
- MADE RICH.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.721
- FOR THAT SMALL
OF A BAR CODE,

13:25.804 --> 13:27.139
YOU COULD HAVE DONE
A LITTLE BIT BETTER

13:27.223 --> 13:29.808
GETTING THIS THING
NICE AND SQUARE.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.393
- CHRIS.
- TATTOO'S DEFINITELY

13:31.477 --> 13:32.353
THE ROUGHEST ONE
WE'VE SEEN.

13:32.436 --> 13:33.521
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO WALK AWAY

13:33.604 --> 13:34.897
OUT OF THIS ELIMINATION
CHALLENGE

13:34.980 --> 13:37.233
UNLESS YOU GET YOUR LINE WORK
A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.234
- I UNDERSTAND.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.236
{\an8}TO COMPLETELY BOMB

13:40.319 --> 13:41.987
{\an8}IN FRONT OF SOMEBODY
I RESPECT,

13:42.071 --> 13:44.156
{\an8}THAT'S BULL[bleep].

13:44.240 --> 13:47.535
I CAN'T GET MY HEAD
OUT OF MY ASS.

13:47.618 --> 13:48.410
{\an8}- WHAT THE [bleep]?

13:48.494 --> 13:49.828
{\an8}FIGURE OUT
HOW TO CUT SOME SPRINGS.

13:49.912 --> 13:50.579
{\an8}- DO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
TO KNOW THAT STUFF?

13:50.663 --> 13:52.623
{\an8}I COULD CARE [bleep] LESS.

13:52.706 --> 13:53.958
{\an8}- WHAT'S YOUR DEAL,
JIME?

13:54.041 --> 13:55.584
- YOU'RE ABOUT ONE OF
THE MOST PHONIEST [bleep] PEOPLE

13:55.668 --> 13:57.336
I'VE EVER SEEN.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.219
- ALL RIGHT, TODAY'S CHALLENGE
WAS LINE WORK.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.888
NOTHING IS MORE LINE-SPECIFIC
THAN A BAR CODE.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.098
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BOTTOM.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.099
WE HAD A COUPLE PEOPLE
WHO COULDN'T EVEN

14:10.182 --> 14:12.893
BUILD MACHINES,
ALLY AND TATU BABY.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.104
- BOTH OF THEM JUST SEEMED
TO NOT HAVE ANY CLUE

14:15.187 --> 14:16.480
ABOUT WHICH WAY TO GO.

14:16.564 --> 14:17.481
THAT'S JUST NOT
WHAT WE WANT TO SEE.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.775
- ONE GUY WHO DID
GET HIS MACHINE TOGETHER

14:19.858 --> 14:22.111
BUT MISSED
THE LINE CHALLENGE,

14:22.194 --> 14:23.445
CHRIS.
- CHRIS.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.572
- THE LINES
WERE PRETTY SHAKY.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.115
- A BIG EXCUSE
THAT WE HEAR IS,

14:26.198 --> 14:27.700
"OH, IT'S ON A HARD PART
OF THE SKIN."

14:27.783 --> 14:28.784
IF YOU'RE A MASTER, YOU SHOULD
BE ABLE TO DO THAT TATTOO

14:28.867 --> 14:31.370
ANYWHERE THE CLIENT
WANTS IT.

14:31.453 --> 14:33.622
- AS FAR AS TATTOOERS
THAT EXCELLED TODAY--

14:33.706 --> 14:36.750
- CRAIG'S SHOWN US THAT HE'S
REALLY A PROFICIENT TATTOOER.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.961
HE HAD NO PROBLEMS
PUTTING HIS MACHINE TOGETHER.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.504
- ANYBODY ELSE
RISING TO THE TOP?

14:40.588 --> 14:41.964
both: JIME.
- THING ABOUT JIME'S IS

14:42.047 --> 14:43.173
IT LOOKED
LIKE A BAR CODE.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.049
EVEN HIS THICKER LINES,
THE DETAIL,

14:44.133 --> 14:45.593
THE SQUARING THEM OFF
WAS VERY NICE.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.595
- WELL, I THINK
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR

14:47.678 --> 14:48.804
WHO THE WINNER
OF THE DAY IS.

14:48.887 --> 14:50.639
LET'S GO LET THEM KNOW.
- ALL RIGHT.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.059
- TODAY,
WE PUSHED YOUR LIMITS.

14:54.143 --> 14:54.977
NOT ONLY DID WE ASK YOU

14:55.060 --> 14:57.104
TO ASSEMBLE
YOUR OWN TATTOO MACHINE,

14:57.187 --> 15:01.650
BUT YOU ALSO HAD TO TATTOO
THE ULTIMATE TEST OF LINE.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.319
THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED

15:03.402 --> 15:07.406
THAT THE WINNER OF TODAY'S
FLASH CHALLENGE IS...

15:11.243 --> 15:14.913
CRAIG.
[light applause]

15:14.997 --> 15:18.042
YOU WILL HAVE THE POWER
TO ASSIGN ALL HUMAN CANVASES

15:18.125 --> 15:19.335
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.171
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE IT.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.631
A FEW PEOPLE
ARE GIVING LOOKS LIKE,

15:23.714 --> 15:25.966
"DON'T SCREW ME OVER,"
BUT JOSH IS OFFICIALLY

15:26.050 --> 15:29.762
THE GUY THAT HAS TO WORRY
ABOUT IT.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.096
- HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT

15:31.180 --> 15:32.681
AND GET READY
TO MEET YOUR CANVASES

15:32.765 --> 15:36.185
FOR THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

15:43.942 --> 15:46.737
- HONESTLY, LIKE,
HOW FAR DO YOU THINK

15:46.820 --> 15:48.864
YOU COULD POSSIBLY GET
IN THIS WHOLE COMPETITION

15:48.947 --> 15:51.867
AND NOT BUILD
A TATTOO MACHINE FROM SCRATCH?

15:51.950 --> 15:53.702
- YEAH.
- I AM NOT A TINKERER

15:53.786 --> 15:55.162
LIKE YOU GUYS.
- BUT I'M JUST SAYING,

15:55.245 --> 15:58.290
IN MY CAREER, THAT WAS, LIKE,
THE FOUNDATION OF STARTING

15:58.374 --> 15:59.750
TO LEARN HOW TO TATTOO.
- AND I--YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:59.833 --> 16:01.502
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I'M NOT REALLY GOOD

16:01.585 --> 16:02.795
WITH THE MECHANICAL PART OF IT.
I'LL OWN THAT.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.089
- WHAT THE [bleep]?
REALLY, LIKE,

16:05.172 --> 16:06.548
FIGURE OUT
HOW TO CUT SOME SPRINGS.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.676
{\an8}- DO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
TO KNOW THAT STUFF? YEAH.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.386
{\an8}DOES IT MAKE OR BREAK WHO I AM
AND THE TATTOO ARTIST I AM?

16:10.469 --> 16:12.304
{\an8}[bleep] NO.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.597
I DRIVE
A '66 CHEVELLE MALIBU,

16:13.681 --> 16:15.766
'CAUSE I [bleep] LOVE IT,

16:15.849 --> 16:17.017
BUT DO I KNOW HOW
TO [bleep] PULL THE MOTOR?

16:17.101 --> 16:20.688
NO. IT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M ANY LESS OF AN ARTIST

16:20.771 --> 16:22.064
BECAUSE I CAN'T PULL
MY TATTOO MACHINE APART.

16:22.147 --> 16:23.023
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT YOU WERE
LESS, I'M JUST QUESTIONING.

16:23.107 --> 16:24.942
- I'M JUST--
- WITHOUT THAT KNOWLEDGE,

16:25.025 --> 16:26.819
I OWN A BUSINESS,
I FEED MY KIDS.

16:26.902 --> 16:28.946
SO DO I THINK
IT MAKES OR BREAKS ME,

16:29.029 --> 16:32.991
WHAT THEY HAVE TO [bleep] SAY,
I COULD CARE [bleep] LESS.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.130
- WELCOME
TO THE ELIMINATION TATTOO.

16:46.213 --> 16:51.260
SUCCEED, AND YOU'LL BE
THAT MUCH CLOSER TO $100,000

16:51.343 --> 16:53.429
AND THE TITLE
OF INK MASTER.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.557
FAIL, AND YOU'LL
BE PACKING UP.

16:56.640 --> 17:00.561
YOU'LL BE JUDGED BY OLIVER PECK,
CHRIS NUNEZ, AND MYSELF,

17:00.644 --> 17:02.688
AND OF COURSE,
BY OUR GUEST JUDGE,

17:02.771 --> 17:04.272
MR. SETH CIFERRI.

17:04.356 --> 17:07.443
BUT WE'RE NOT
YOUR ONLY CRITICS.

17:07.526 --> 17:10.362
EACH WEEK, SPIKE AND TACO BELL
ARE GIVING VIEWERS

17:10.445 --> 17:13.656
THE OPPORTUNITY
TO GO TO INKMASTER.SPIKE.COM

17:13.741 --> 17:16.160
AND VOTE FOR THE TATTOO
THAT THEY THINK IS THE BEST.

17:16.242 --> 17:18.454
AMERICA'S VOTE
WILL HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT

17:18.537 --> 17:20.622
ON THE LIVE FINALE.

17:20.705 --> 17:25.127
{\an1}THIS WEEK, WE'RE TESTING A SKILL
THAT'S CRUCIAL TO ANY TATTOO--

17:25.210 --> 17:27.463
LINES.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.548
{\an8}- LINE WORK IS
THE LONGEST-LASTING ELEMENT

17:29.631 --> 17:30.758
{\an8}OF A TATTOO.

17:30.841 --> 17:31.800
EVERYTHING ELSE
IS GONNA FADE AWAY.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.261
- FOR THIS ELIMINATION TATTOO,

17:34.344 --> 17:38.098
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS
TO CREATE A CELTIC TATTOO.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.476
- [whistles]
- WHAT?

17:40.559 --> 17:42.478
{\an8}WHAT THE [bleep], CELTIC?

17:42.561 --> 17:44.104
THE LAST TIME I DID
A CELTIC DESIGN

17:44.188 --> 17:46.440
WAS ONCE UPON
A VERY LONG TIME AGO

17:46.523 --> 17:47.649
THAT I DO NOT REMEMBER.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.526
- THE ORIGINS
OF CELTIC TATTOOS

17:49.610 --> 17:51.570
DATE BACK THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

17:51.653 --> 17:52.946
- CELTIC TATTOOS

17:53.030 --> 17:55.032
ARE SOME OF THE MOST
LABOR-INTENSIVE TATTOOS.

17:55.115 --> 17:55.824
THE LINES
NEED TO BE PARALLEL.

17:55.908 --> 17:57.451
{\an8}IT NEEDS TO GO
OVER AND UNDER.

17:57.534 --> 18:01.663
{\an8}IT'S SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE IT'S
AN INTRICATELY WOVEN DESIGN.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.334
- LET'S MEET YOUR CANVASES.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.048
CRAIG, YOU WON
THE FLASH CHALLENGE.

18:11.131 --> 18:14.343
YOU NOW HAVE THE POWER TO ASSIGN
ALL THE HUMAN CANVASES,

18:14.426 --> 18:17.012
BUT CHOOSE CAREFULLY.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.347
- JOSH SHOULD BE NERVOUS.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.265
{\an8}HE'S ESTABLISHED HIMSELF
AS THAT GUY.

18:20.349 --> 18:21.517
WORST TATTOO THAT COMES UP,
GIVE IT TO JOSH.

18:21.600 --> 18:25.103
- I WANT TO GET A CELTIC TRINITY
AND INCORPORATE STEAMPUNK.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.482
{\an8}- I'M HERE
TO PLAY THE GAME,

18:28.565 --> 18:29.858
{\an8}AND THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
SHOULD BE DOING.

18:29.942 --> 18:30.943
{\an8}EVERYBODY SHOULD BE
PLAYING THE GAME.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.236
- CELTIC TREE WITH ANIMALS.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.279
- JOSH HAS BEEN FULL OF [bleep]
SINCE DAY ONE.

18:34.363 --> 18:35.989
WHEN HE'S TALKING TO YOU,
YOU IMMEDIATELY

18:36.073 --> 18:38.158
HAVE TO START THINKING
FIVE STEPS AHEAD OF JOSH.

18:38.242 --> 18:40.786
THERE'S A PLAN ALWAYS.

18:40.869 --> 18:43.121
- A CELTIC STARFISH
ON MY RIBCAGE.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.041
- ARE YOU OPEN FOR SUGGESTIONS
FROM THE TATTOO ARTIST?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.918
- NO.
- GOOD TO KNOW.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.840
- CRAIG'S JUST TIRED
OF LISTENING TO JOSH'S MOUTH.

18:52.923 --> 18:54.174
{\an8}JOSH JUST NEEDS
TO SHUT THE [bleep] UP

18:54.258 --> 18:56.552
{\an8}AND JUST PACK HIS BAGS
AND GO HOME.

18:56.635 --> 18:59.179
- CANVASES, ONE BY ONE,

18:59.263 --> 19:02.099
PLEASE READ THE NAME
ON THE BOTTOM OF YOUR SKULL.

19:02.182 --> 19:02.474
- JASON.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.768
- JIME.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.562
- CHRIS.
- CELTIC ANIMAL TREE.

19:06.645 --> 19:07.813
{\an8}I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
CELTIC ANIMAL.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.648
THAT [bleep] SUCKS.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.400
- TATU BABY.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.026
- JOEY.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.653
- CRAIG.

19:14.736 --> 19:17.781
- KYLE.
- WORD.

19:21.618 --> 19:24.079
- JOSHUA.

19:24.163 --> 19:28.041
{\an8}- CELTIC STARFISH ON HER RIBS,
PERFECT FOR JOSH.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.710
- I DON'T MIND
TATTOOING RIBCAGES.

19:29.793 --> 19:31.837
{\an8}CRAIG WAS TRYING TO GIVE ME
A CHALLENGE IN THIS ONE,

19:31.920 --> 19:33.255
{\an8}BUT IT'S GONNA WORK
TO MY ADVANTAGE.

19:33.338 --> 19:34.840
- ALLY.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.925
- MADE RICH.
- BUT IT WORK.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.760
- ES.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.470
- JACKIE.

19:40.554 --> 19:43.140
- REMEMBER, ARTISTS,
AFTER THE ELIMINATION TATTOO,

19:43.223 --> 19:45.767
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY
WILL VOTE ON THE TATTOO

19:45.851 --> 19:47.561
THAT THEY THINK
IS THE WORST

19:47.644 --> 19:50.147
AND PUT ONE ARTIST
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.732
YOU HAVE
THE REST OF THE EVENING

19:51.815 --> 19:53.650
TO CONSULT
WITH YOUR HUMAN CANVASES.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.777
TOMORROW,
YOU'LL HAVE SIX HOURS

19:55.861 --> 19:57.738
TO COMPLETE
YOUR CELTIC TATTOO.

19:57.821 --> 20:00.490
BASED ON YOUR WORK,
ONE OF YOU WILL CLOSE SHOP.

20:00.574 --> 20:02.951
GOOD LUCK.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.578
{\an8}- EVERY CELTIC DESIGN

20:04.661 --> 20:06.788
{\an8}IS GONNA BE
A LOT OF INTENSE LINE WORK.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.624
- LET'S DO IT.
COME ON THIS WAY.

20:08.707 --> 20:10.375
- THERE'S SO MANY
INTERSECTIONS.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.252
THAT NEEDLE
HAS TO GO IN AND OUT

20:12.336 --> 20:13.503
SO THAT YOUR LINES
BUTT UP PERFECTLY.

20:13.587 --> 20:18.342
EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED ARTIST
IS GONNA FEEL THE PRESSURE.

20:18.425 --> 20:19.801
- THE RIBS, THOUGH, HUH?

20:19.885 --> 20:21.887
A LOT OF LINE WORK SUCKS,
'CAUSE THAT'S THE SPOT

20:21.970 --> 20:24.640
WHERE YOU SOMETIMES GO,
"OOH, OOH, AHH, OH!"

20:24.723 --> 20:26.350
DID YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER BACKUP PLANS

20:26.433 --> 20:27.309
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY?

20:27.392 --> 20:29.645
- I COULD DO, LIKE,
MAYBE MY LEFT ARM.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.813
- THAT WOULD REALLY
MAKE MY LIFE A LOT EASIER.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.440
{\an8}JUST MAKE IT EASIER ON ME,
PLEASE.

20:33.523 --> 20:34.816
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
- YEAH, I MEAN,

20:34.900 --> 20:35.984
WE COULD DO MY OTHER ARM, THEN.
- YEAH.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.278
I WOULD LOVE TO, I MEAN,
IF YOU COULD HELP ME OUT.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.821
- YEAH.
- I COULD REALLY USE THE HELP.

20:39.905 --> 20:41.073
YOU KNOW,
I'D APPRECIATE IT.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.867
- SO I THINK I WANT SOMETHING
A LITTLE BIT MORE INTRICATE.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.786
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

20:45.869 --> 20:46.703
- DO YOU LIKE THIS?

20:46.787 --> 20:48.789
- THE LINES
ARE TOO FAR APART FOR ME.

20:48.872 --> 20:51.166
- OKAY.
LET'S SEE.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.960
{\an8}CRAIG WAS TRYING TO GIVE ME
A CHALLENGE ON THIS ONE,

20:53.043 --> 20:54.628
{\an8}BUT I'M SO GOOD
AT DEALING WITH PEOPLE,

20:54.711 --> 20:56.004
{\an8}IT'S GONNA BITE HIM
IN THE ASS.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.506
RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST KIND OF,
LIKE, GOING, "OKAY,

20:57.589 --> 20:59.091
HERE'S WHAT SHE LIKES,
HERE'S WHAT SHE DOESN'T LIKE,"

20:59.174 --> 21:01.551
SO I CAN MAKE SURE I DESIGN
SOMETHING YOU'RE GONNA LOVE.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.513
- IT'S A CELTIC KNOT CROSS,
RIGHT?

21:04.596 --> 21:07.849
- RIGHT, I ALSO NEED
THE NUMBER 13 AND 13 TO--

21:07.933 --> 21:10.477
- YEAH, LET ME THINK
ABOUT THAT ONE FOR A SECOND.

21:10.560 --> 21:14.022
- MY CANVAS WANTS A LOT
OF REALLY SPECIFIC STUFF.

21:14.106 --> 21:18.110
{\an8}HE WANTS 13s IN THE CROSS,
WHICH I AM WORRIED ABOUT

21:18.193 --> 21:21.363
{\an8}BECAUSE IT'S GONNA MESS WITH
THE INTEGRITY OF THE KNOT WORK.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.949
- IT'S JUST I REALLY
NEED THAT INCORPORATED,

21:24.032 --> 21:25.283
BECAUSE THIS IS ACTUALLY
A TATTOO

21:25.367 --> 21:28.203
THAT IS KIND OF LIKE
A TRIBUTE TO MY BROTHER.

21:28.286 --> 21:31.540
- HE DOESN'T SEEM TO WANT
TO BUDGE AT ALL.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.626
I VERY WELL COULD BE
GOING HOME FROM THIS.

21:40.799 --> 21:41.800
- HEY, BABY.

21:41.883 --> 21:44.511
SO THE GUY WANTS TO DO GREEN,
YOU KNOW, IN HERE.

21:44.594 --> 21:46.888
I WAS GONNA DO YELLOW,
LIKE, HERE.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.849
- WELL, YOU DON'T WANT
TO KEEP IT TOO BUSY.

21:48.932 --> 21:50.976
- OR IF WE DO
THE YELLOWS IN HERE,

21:51.059 --> 21:52.894
THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING.
- YEAH, I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.772
{\an8}LOOKING AT ALLY'S TATTOO,

21:55.856 --> 21:58.317
{\an8}SHE DEFINITELY GOT ONE
OF THE MOST STANDARD DESIGNS,

21:58.400 --> 22:01.695
{\an8}BUT ALLY SEEMS TO BE STRUGGLING
WITH THIS ONE.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.655
- WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?
- I WOULD RECOMMEND EITHER,

22:03.739 --> 22:06.074
LIKE,
A GRAYISH OR A BROWNISH,

22:06.158 --> 22:08.368
'CAUSE THAT'S GONNA
LOOK TOO BRIGHT.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.244
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

22:09.327 --> 22:13.665
MY DESIGN ISN'T AS GOOD
AS IT COULD BE.

22:13.749 --> 22:17.336
{\an8}I'M DEFINITELY WORRIED.

22:17.419 --> 22:21.214
- ARTISTS, YOU HAVE SIX HOURS
TO CREATE A CELTIC TATTOO.

22:21.298 --> 22:22.883
ONE BAD LINE,
AND YOU'RE SCREWED.

22:22.966 --> 22:27.012
YOUR TIME BEGINS NOW.

22:27.095 --> 22:28.096
- ALL RIGHT.
- READY.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.389
- COME ON, BUDDY.
- ALL RIGHT.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.434
{\an8}- CELTIC IS THE EPITOME
OF LINE WORK FOR THE SIMPLE FACT

22:32.517 --> 22:34.603
{\an8}THAT ALL THE LINES
HAVE TO BE PARALLEL,

22:34.686 --> 22:36.521
{\an8}PERFECTLY STRAIGHT
ON BOTH SIDES,

22:36.605 --> 22:38.732
{\an8}SAME LINE WEIGHT,
SAME THICKNESS.

22:38.815 --> 22:41.276
IT'S A STYLE
THAT ALL PROFICIENT TATTOOERS

22:41.359 --> 22:43.320
SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO.

22:43.403 --> 22:46.406
- MY CANVAS WAS EXTREMELY
SPECIFIC ON WHAT HE WANTS.

22:46.490 --> 22:49.284
- YOU GOT THE KNOTS
EXACTLY THE WAY I WANTED THEM.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.536
- I HAD TO REDRAW
QUITE A BIT.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.914
I PUT THE 13s
IN THE BACKGROUND

22:53.997 --> 22:55.832
SO THAT IT DOESN'T
MESS WITH THE CROSS ITSELF.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.043
- YOU NAILED IT.

22:58.126 --> 22:59.544
- LINES HAVE TO BE PERFECT.

22:59.628 --> 23:02.547
ARE YOU READY?

23:02.631 --> 23:03.799
[rock music]

23:03.882 --> 23:06.259
[tattoo gun buzzing]

23:06.343 --> 23:09.179
{\an8}- I'M GONNA GO
FOR AS BARE BONES

23:09.262 --> 23:10.472
{\an8}OF A TRADITIONAL CELTIC DESIGN
AS I CAN.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.433
I WANT TO DO
REALLY LIGHT SHADING ON IT.

23:13.517 --> 23:16.728
I NEED TO REDEEM MYSELF.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.731
- FOUR HOURS REMAINING.

23:19.815 --> 23:22.442
[tattoo guns buzzing]

23:22.526 --> 23:24.319
- AHH...
[breathing heavily]

23:24.402 --> 23:29.157
- MY CANVAS WANTS
A CELTIC STARFISH ON HER SIDE.

23:29.241 --> 23:29.783
IT'S REALLY, REALLY NICE
AND FITS YOU REALLY WELL.

23:29.866 --> 23:31.993
I LIKE IT A LOT.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.287
{\an8}I'M GONNA FOCUS ON MAKING SURE
THAT ALL MY LINES

23:34.371 --> 23:35.747
{\an8}ARE ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.083
- HOW ARE YOU DOING HERE,
MR. QUIET MACHINES?

23:38.166 --> 23:39.835
- MY BACK HURTS.
- UH-HUH.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.336
- AND I HAVE AROUND,
LIKE, 1,000 LINES.

23:41.419 --> 23:43.755
- RIGHT.
- THAT'S ABOUT MY DAY.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.842
DUDE, MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO
AND FINISH YOUR TATTOO.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.468
- LOOKS WONDERFUL.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.512
- WHAT A SWEETHEART.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.264
- I'M DOING A REALISTIC ELEPHANT
AT THE TOP,

23:52.347 --> 23:55.267
AND GOING TO A CELTIC DESIGN
AT THE BOTTOM.

23:55.350 --> 23:58.520
{\an8}POTENTIALLY,
I CAN BE THE NEW INK MASTER.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.438
I TOTALLY FEEL I CAN WIN IT,
ALMOST SOMEWHAT DESTINY.

24:00.522 --> 24:03.233
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
A EASY CAKE WALK EITHER.

24:03.316 --> 24:05.402
DEFINITELY GONNA HAVE
TO FIGHT FOR IT.

24:05.485 --> 24:06.820
- HOPEFULLY, ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I'M GONNA GET TO TRY

24:06.903 --> 24:08.572
TO SHOW OFF LIKE YOU.
[laughter]

24:08.655 --> 24:12.868
- CRAIG'S TATTOO IS JUST
A PAINTERLY STYLE TATTOO

24:12.951 --> 24:14.452
WITH SOME CELTIC IN IT,
WHICH I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO DO,

24:14.536 --> 24:17.539
BUT I FELT LIKE THIS
WAS A LINE WORK CHALLENGE.

24:20.917 --> 24:24.004
- I'VE GOT A BIG TATTOO TO DO,
AND TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.

24:24.087 --> 24:26.006
I'M PULLING
STUPID-LOOKING LINES.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.215
THEY'RE CROSSING OVER.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.550
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE
A BEGINNING TATTOOER.

24:28.633 --> 24:29.885
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.637
- HOLY MACKEREL!
GETTING BIG WITH IT.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.722
- THIS IS NOT GONNA
TURN OUT WELL.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.308
THERE'S JUST NO GOOD
OUTLINE QUALITY ABOUT THIS,

24:36.391 --> 24:39.144
AND THE DESIGN
OF THIS ENTIRE TATTOO

24:39.227 --> 24:40.729
IS JUST MUDDY AND JUMBLED
AND LOST.

24:40.812 --> 24:42.105
LATER, GUYS.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.441
- I'M MAKING POOR DECISIONS
WITH MY DESIGN.

24:44.524 --> 24:48.320
I NEED TO SIMPLIFY
THESE TATTOOS.

24:48.403 --> 24:49.905
- TWO HOURS TO GO.

24:49.988 --> 24:53.033
[tattoo guns buzzing]

24:53.116 --> 24:54.576
- [winces]

24:54.659 --> 24:56.244
- I DIDN'T DO SO WELL
IN THE FLASH CHALLENGE,

24:56.328 --> 24:57.954
AND NOW
I HAVE TO REDEEM MYSELF.

24:58.038 --> 25:01.291
- OH, MY GOD.

25:01.374 --> 25:03.418
I DEFINITELY FEEL LIKE
THIS IS AN OVERAMBITIOUS TATTOO.

25:03.501 --> 25:07.672
I'M TRYING TO MAKE LEMONADE
OUT OF LEMONS.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.591
- UGH.
[inhales sharply]

25:09.674 --> 25:12.260
THAT [bleep] HURTS
SO BAD.

25:12.344 --> 25:14.304
- I HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED
ON WHAT I'M DOING.

25:14.387 --> 25:15.847
I'M IN IT.
I'M IN MY ZONE.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.934
- [exhales]

25:20.769 --> 25:23.021
- GOT THE BIG CROSS?
- YEP.

25:23.104 --> 25:25.607
- ALLY'S LINE WORK
IS JUST VERY UNCLEAN.

25:25.690 --> 25:26.608
IT'S GOT BLOWOUTS,
WHICH IS

25:26.691 --> 25:28.026
WHEN THE INK ACTUALLY
GOES UNDER THE SKIN

25:28.109 --> 25:30.737
IN A WRONG DIRECTION

25:30.820 --> 25:31.988
AND CREATES, LIKE,
A BRUISING EFFECT.

25:32.072 --> 25:32.656
THAT'S NO GOOD.

25:32.739 --> 25:34.991
- I'M NOT USED TO BLOWOUTS.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.076
I TRIED
TURNING THE MACHINE DOWN.

25:36.159 --> 25:38.870
I TRIED GOING LIGHTER.

25:38.954 --> 25:42.249
I'M OFF MY GAME
IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.292
- 30 MINUTES TO GO.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.753
- I SPENT SO MUCH TIME
ON MAKING MY LINES CLEAN.

25:46.836 --> 25:48.713
I'M VERY NERVOUS
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO FINISH.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.341
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO REALLY
SIMPLIFY THE COLOR WORK ON IT,

25:51.424 --> 25:53.218
AND HOPEFULLY,
I CAN GET DONE WITH IT.

25:53.301 --> 25:58.014
- TEN, NINE, EIGHT, SEVEN,

25:58.098 --> 26:01.142
SIX, FIVE, FOUR,

26:01.226 --> 26:04.771
THREE, TWO, ONE...

26:04.854 --> 26:06.898
THAT'S IT.
MACHINES DOWN.

26:06.982 --> 26:07.983
NO MORE INK.

26:08.066 --> 26:08.817
- YOU LIKE IT?

26:08.900 --> 26:11.861
- IT'S EVEN BETTER
THAN I IMAGINED.

26:13.238 --> 26:15.991
- IT IS SO AMAZING.
- YUP.

26:16.074 --> 26:18.743
- THAT IS SICK.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.662
- ONCE AGAIN,
I RUSHED THIS DAMN TATTOO.

26:20.745 --> 26:23.999
MY LINE WORK IS [bleep].
IT'S NOT SMOOTH.

26:24.082 --> 26:25.500
I DON'T TATTOO LIKE THIS.

26:25.583 --> 26:29.921
I JUST DON'T EVEN
FEEL LIKE MYSELF ANYMORE.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.550
{\an8}- IT'S A COMPETITION.
WE'RE HERE TO WIN MONEY.

26:33.633 --> 26:34.092
{\an8}- "I'M GONNA [bleep] DO THIS
STRATEGICALLY.

26:34.175 --> 26:36.136
{\an8}I'M GONNA DO THIS."

26:36.219 --> 26:37.304
{\an8}DUDE, YOU'RE JUST,
LIKE, A DICKHEAD.

26:37.387 --> 26:38.763
- I HAVE A BIG PROBLEM
WITH THIS TATTOO.

26:38.847 --> 26:39.806
- I DREW THIS GODDAMN THING.

26:39.889 --> 26:40.724
- IT LOOKS LIKE
A TOTAL MALFUNCTION.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.233
- SO HOW WAS JOSH'S?

26:50.317 --> 26:51.693
- WHEN I SEEN IT, AT HOUR FIVE,
IT WAS STILL AN OUTLINE.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.653
- HE WENT OVER THAT [bleep]
LIKE, EIGHT TIMES.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.448
HE JUST KEPT OUTLINING,
JUST KEPT OUTLINING.

26:56.531 --> 26:58.783
- JOSH'S TATTOO
WAS JUST AN OUTLINE.

26:58.867 --> 27:02.203
IT DOESN'T LOOK FINISHED.
IT'S NOTHING ARTISTIC.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.247
- HEY, JOSH,
HOW WAS YOUR OUTLINE?

27:04.331 --> 27:06.875
YOU FINISHED?
- FINALLY FINISHED IT.

27:06.958 --> 27:09.044
- 'CAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WOULD'VE
BEEN ONE OF THE FIRST ONES DONE.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.962
- A LOT OF FRICKIN' SKIN,
MAN.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.964
- BUT HOW IN THE WORLD
DID THAT TAKE SIX HOURS?

27:13.048 --> 27:15.633
- I LITERALLY DID FIVE HOURS
OF FRICKIN' LINES.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.093
- FIVE HOURS OF LINE WORK?

27:17.177 --> 27:20.764
- I JUST--I JUST WAS SLOW.
THAT'S ALL I CAN REALLY SAY.

27:20.847 --> 27:23.058
{\an8}- IN MY OPINION, JOSH
IS GOING DOWN FOR THIS ONE.

27:23.141 --> 27:24.934
THIS GUY JUST MIGHT AS WELL
PACK HIS [bleep]

27:25.018 --> 27:26.686
AND GO HOME NOW.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.704
- TODAY, WE ASKED YOU
TO SHOW US

27:44.788 --> 27:47.874
CLEAN LINES
IN A CELTIC TATTOO.

27:47.957 --> 27:51.086
KYLE,
LET'S START WITH YOU.

27:53.046 --> 27:55.256
WHAT WERE YOUR CONCERNS
GOING INTO THIS TATTOO?

27:55.340 --> 27:57.759
- LINE WORK'S NOT REALLY
MY SPECIALTY.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.387
- WHAT MAKES DOING CELTIC
SO HARD IS THAT

28:00.470 --> 28:03.598
THE LINE WIDTH AT ALL TIMES
IS USUALLY THE SAME,

28:03.681 --> 28:06.643
AND THAT'S WHERE YOU BLOW
THE CONSISTENCY OF THE LINE,

28:06.726 --> 28:08.144
BECAUSE IT'S NOT MATCHING.

28:08.228 --> 28:11.815
TESTING ON LINE, WE HAVE
TO STICK TO THOSE GUIDELINES,

28:11.898 --> 28:14.984
AND I JUST THINK
YOU MISSED THE MARK A BIT.

28:15.068 --> 28:18.405
- JOEY.

28:18.488 --> 28:20.657
- THIS IS A GREAT JOB, MAN.
THIS IS ONE HELL OF AN OUTLINE.

28:20.740 --> 28:24.452
IT'S ALL VERY STRAIGHT.
IT'S VERY PERFECT.

28:24.536 --> 28:26.121
- NICE PARALLEL LOOK.

28:26.204 --> 28:27.497
I THINK THE FACT
THAT YOU PACKED THE COLOR

28:27.580 --> 28:28.665
IN THIS THING SO SOLID

28:28.748 --> 28:29.791
MAKES THIS CELTIC
REALLY STAND APART.

28:29.874 --> 28:34.295
SUPER TECHNICAL TATTOO, MAN.
THIS IS GREAT.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.714
- CHRIS.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.383
- LIKE, I WENT AT THIS
LIKE I JUST WANTED TO DO

28:38.466 --> 28:39.467
SOMETHING BARE BONES,
KINDA RESET MYSELF,

28:39.551 --> 28:41.428
SHOW MORE OF WHAT I CAN DO.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.179
- IN TERMS OF
A LINE CHALLENGE,

28:43.263 --> 28:43.972
YOU DIDN'T REALLY
MEET THE MARK.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.307
THE LINE
IS A BIT INCONSISTENT.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.184
IT'S SHAKY
AND KIND OF SCRATCHY,

28:48.268 --> 28:49.352
AND THERE'S A LOT OF POINTS

28:49.436 --> 28:50.895
WHERE IT BREAKS
AND DOESN'T REALLY CONNECT.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.313
- SEE, THAT'S THE PROBLEM
I'VE BEEN HAVING.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.107
IT'S LIKE, I'LL DO TOO MUCH
OR TOO LITTLE.

28:54.190 --> 28:55.984
- SLOW DOWN AND TAKE YOUR TIME
ON THOSE LINES

28:56.067 --> 28:57.318
AND MAKE THEM 100% PRECISE.

28:57.402 --> 28:58.611
WHEN YOU'RE IN A COMPETITION
LIKE THIS,

28:58.695 --> 29:01.197
YOU REALLY NEED
TO STEP YOUR GAME UP.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.908
- RICH.

29:03.992 --> 29:06.286
- WHAT WAS THIS DESIGN
THAT YOU CAME UP WITH?

29:06.369 --> 29:08.329
- BASICALLY WANTED
A GILA MONSTER.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.414
I HAND-DREW
THE WHOLE DESIGN

29:09.497 --> 29:11.916
AND PUT SOME ELEMENTS TOGETHER
THAT I THOUGHT WORKED.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.502
- THIS TONGUE DRIVES ME NUTS.
IT'S SO HEAVY.

29:14.586 --> 29:16.337
THAT'S THE FIRST THING
THAT MY EYE GOES TO, IS LIKE,

29:16.421 --> 29:17.297
"WHAT IS THAT"?

29:17.380 --> 29:20.175
AT LEAST MAKE THAT
OUTER RIGHT-SIDE EDGE

29:20.258 --> 29:21.843
CONSISTENTLY ROUND
AND FOLLOW THE SHAPE.

29:21.926 --> 29:25.805
MAN, MAKE SURE THAT WHAT
YOU DO GIVE IS METICULOUS.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.140
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING

29:27.223 --> 29:28.516
THAT HAS
A REALLY TREMENDOUS WOW FACTOR

29:28.600 --> 29:30.393
IN THIS TATTOO.

29:30.477 --> 29:33.104
- JACKIE.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.190
- RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
THIS TATTOO LOOKS COOL.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.900
IT'S A COOL DESIGN,
IT FITS ON HIS CHEST,

29:36.983 --> 29:38.693
BUT WHEN I GET IN
AND LOOK AT THE OUTLINE,

29:38.776 --> 29:42.113
FIRST THING THAT POPS OFF TO ME
IS IN THOSE ORBIT LINES

29:42.197 --> 29:43.448
NOT BEING REAL SMOOTH

29:43.531 --> 29:44.908
AND NOT BEING REALLY,
REALLY ROUND.

29:44.991 --> 29:46.784
- THAT MAIN LINE
THAT COMES UP THROUGH THERE,

29:46.868 --> 29:49.954
IT'S NOT REAL PARALLEL,
NOT REAL CRISP.

29:50.038 --> 29:51.539
IT KIND OF WAVERS
THROUGHOUT.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.916
- IT'S A LITTLE
MORE NOTICEABLE

29:52.999 --> 29:54.876
BECAUSE IT IS, LIKE,
SUCH A LONG, OPEN LINE.

29:54.959 --> 29:55.752
- I THINK IT LEAVES
A LOT TO BE DESIRED

29:55.835 --> 29:59.881
IN TERMS
OF TECHNICAL APPLICATION.

29:59.964 --> 30:02.717
- ALLY.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.385
- THIS TATTOO IS ROUGH.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.012
THESE 13s, THEY'RE BEAT.

30:06.095 --> 30:09.766
THE SHAPE OF THE 13s
ARE JUST VERY SKETCHY AND IFFY.

30:09.849 --> 30:11.768
- HE WANTED THE 13s
IN THE CROSS,

30:11.851 --> 30:14.395
AND SO I'M THINKING, "OH, NO,
THAT'S GONNA COMPROMISE

30:14.479 --> 30:15.730
DOING THE KNOT WORK
INSIDE THE CROSS,"

30:15.813 --> 30:17.440
SO I TRIED
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY

30:17.524 --> 30:18.274
TO PUT IT IN
A LITTLE MORE SUBTLE.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.235
- THAT'S NOT SUBTLE.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.571
THAT IS BIG
AND "ABRUPTOUSLY" ROUGH.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.656
- YOU HAVE INCONSISTENCIES
IN YOUR OUTLINE

30:24.739 --> 30:27.158
THAT JUST SHOW THROUGH
IN THE DESIGN.

30:27.242 --> 30:29.577
COMPARED TO WHAT
YOU'RE UP AGAINST,

30:29.661 --> 30:32.205
YOU'RE FALLING
INCREDIBLY SHORT.

30:32.288 --> 30:34.999
- TATU BABY.

30:35.083 --> 30:35.583
- FIRST OFF,
YOU LOOK AT THIS TATTOO,

30:35.667 --> 30:36.709
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL TATTOO.

30:36.793 --> 30:38.711
IT'S NOT A REAL INTRICATE
CELTIC DESIGN.

30:38.795 --> 30:41.756
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE TEETH
ON THESE GEARS,

30:41.839 --> 30:42.882
SOME OF THE TEETH
ARE SQUARED OFF

30:42.966 --> 30:45.760
AND PARTIALLY BEVELED,
SOME OF THE TEETH ARE ROUND.

30:45.843 --> 30:48.555
THERE ARE GEARS
THAT LOOK LIKE ALL OF THESE,

30:48.638 --> 30:50.557
BUT NEVER ON ONE GEAR.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.142
- I SHOULD HAVE PAID A LOT
MORE ATTENTION TO THAT DETAIL.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.395
- IF YOU WOULD HAVE JUST DONE
SUPER CLEAN GEARS BACK THERE

30:55.478 --> 30:56.312
AND MADE THEM TOUGH,

30:56.396 --> 30:58.523
YOU WOULD'VE SHOWN
TREMENDOUS LINE WORK

30:58.606 --> 31:00.942
WHILE GETTING AWAY FROM
HAVING TO DO THE CELTIC STUFF.

31:01.025 --> 31:01.776
OVERALL, IT'S A GOOD JOB
ON THE TATTOO,

31:01.859 --> 31:06.155
BUT LINE WORK,
YOU DODGED A BULLET.

31:07.615 --> 31:10.410
- ES.

31:10.493 --> 31:13.288
- WE SEE THAT YOU DO
THE SLOW, METICULOUS WORK,

31:13.371 --> 31:15.790
AND IN THIS PARTICULAR TATTOO,
IT PAYS OFF.

31:15.873 --> 31:17.500
YOU HAVE
ALL THIS BEVEL EDGE,

31:17.584 --> 31:19.335
AND IT'S AS CRISP
AS THE HARD OUTLINE IS,

31:19.419 --> 31:20.420
AND THAT'S A FEAT
IN ITSELF.

31:20.503 --> 31:21.629
THE BIG PROBLEM
IS WITH THE HEADS.

31:21.713 --> 31:24.799
THEY JUST LOOK SO SIMPLE
IN COMPARISON.

31:24.882 --> 31:27.010
- IF YOU WOULD HAVE
CONTINUED THAT BEVELING,

31:27.093 --> 31:31.764
WE'D BE LOOKING AT A MUCH MORE
COMPLETE-LOOKING TATTOO.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.143
- JASON.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.103
- THIS IS
A PRETTY BAD TATTOO.

31:37.186 --> 31:39.856
THE WINGS HAVE NO DEPTH,
NO REAL TEXTURE TO THEM.

31:39.939 --> 31:41.899
IT'S KIND OF JUST, LIKE,
HALF-ASSED SHADING.

31:41.983 --> 31:43.318
- WHAT REALLY KILLS IT FOR ME

31:43.401 --> 31:44.986
IS THE BIG CELTIC CIRCLE
AROUND THE OUTSIDE.

31:45.069 --> 31:48.197
YOU HAVE A FEW LINES
THAT DON'T COME ALL THE WAY

31:48.281 --> 31:50.992
AND SOLIDLY MEET THE LINE
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO JOIN WITH.

31:51.075 --> 31:52.118
FOR A LINE WORK CHALLENGE,

31:52.201 --> 31:53.870
WE WANT TO SEE THIS [bleep]
LOOKING CRISP.

31:53.953 --> 31:56.623
- YOU'RE NOT FIRING RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE RATTLED.

31:56.706 --> 31:57.999
- I USUALLY HAVE
EIGHT OR NINE HOURS OF SLEEP

31:58.082 --> 31:59.000
BEFORE I TATTOO.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.085
- BRO, THIS IS
A HIGH-PRESSURE SITUATION,

32:01.169 --> 32:02.545
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW
BY LOOKING AT IT...

32:02.629 --> 32:04.047
- YOU'RE POINT--
YOUR POINT'S WELL TAKEN.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.049
- IN THIS CHALLENGE,
YOU'RE FALLING TO THE BOTTOM.

32:06.132 --> 32:08.885
- YEAH.
TRUST ME, I KNOW.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.512
- CRAIG.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.849
- THE DETAIL ON THE ELEPHANT
ALONE IS REALLY INCREDIBLE.

32:14.932 --> 32:16.851
THE CELTIC
WITH THE THREE HEARTS,

32:16.934 --> 32:18.269
THE WAY THAT THING
COMES TOGETHER

32:18.353 --> 32:19.145
AND GOES INTO THE REST
OF THE TRIBAL,

32:19.228 --> 32:21.439
AND THE COLOR
SEPARATES THAT LENGTH,

32:21.522 --> 32:22.398
I REALLY LIKED THAT.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.275
- WHEN YOU FIRST CAME IN,
I DIDN'T EXPECT

32:24.359 --> 32:26.194
TO SEE THESE VARYING STYLES.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.362
IT'S IMPRESSIVE.

32:27.445 --> 32:30.657
YOU'RE DEFINITELY THE GUY
TO WATCH AT THIS POINT.

32:31.949 --> 32:33.785
- JIME.

32:33.868 --> 32:36.287
- THE LINE WORK
FALLS A LITTLE SHORT.

32:36.371 --> 32:38.539
THE SHADING IN THE HANDS
IS A LITTLE WEAK

32:38.623 --> 32:40.708
COMPARED TO WHAT I WOULD
EXPECT FROM YOU NORMALLY.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.210
- HE HAD, LIKE,
ALL THESE LITTLE SUN SORES.

32:42.293 --> 32:44.295
IF I STARTED
TO TRY TO SHADE INTO IT,

32:44.379 --> 32:45.880
IT WAS JUST KIND OF, LIKE,
OPENING UP THE SKIN.

32:45.963 --> 32:46.798
- I THINK THIS IS
A BIG REPRESENTATION

32:46.881 --> 32:49.384
FOR EVERYBODY
IN THIS COMPETITION

32:49.467 --> 32:51.344
THAT THE CLIENT YOU GET
CAN DRASTICALLY TAKE YOU

32:51.427 --> 32:53.096
FROM THE TOP ALL THE WAY
DOWN TO THE BOTTOM.

32:53.179 --> 32:55.890
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE PACK TODAY.

32:55.973 --> 32:58.226
- JOSHUA.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.270
- I HAVE ONE BIG PROBLEM
WITH THIS TATTOO.

33:01.354 --> 33:03.314
- OKAY.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.608
- IT WASN'T THE FIRST ONE
OF THE DAY

33:05.692 --> 33:06.567
SO THAT I COULD REFERENCE
YOUR TATTOO

33:06.651 --> 33:07.735
WITH EVERYBODY ELSE'S.

33:07.819 --> 33:10.363
- [sighs]
- BIG PROBLEM.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.615
THIS IS A PERFECT
GODDAMN OUTLINE.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.158
IT'S CONSISTENTLY
THE SAME WIDTH

33:14.242 --> 33:15.201
ALL THE WAY
THROUGHOUT THE TATTOO.

33:15.284 --> 33:19.580
IT'S VERY CLEAN ON ONE
OF THE HARDEST SURFACES.

33:19.664 --> 33:20.498
- YOU'RE VERY METICULOUS

33:20.581 --> 33:23.543
ON EVERY CROSSING
OF THE LINES HERE,

33:23.626 --> 33:25.837
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE CENTER
WHERE IT GETS REALLY INTENSE.

33:25.920 --> 33:28.089
YOU REALLY SHINED
ON THE LINE WORK.

33:28.172 --> 33:30.591
- THERE WAS A STATEMENT MADE
BY JIME THAT I CAN'T DRAW.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.635
I DREW
THIS GODDAMN THING, SO.

33:32.719 --> 33:33.720
- GOOD FOR YOU.
- THANK YOU.

33:33.803 --> 33:37.098
- EVEN BETTER.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.642
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

33:39.726 --> 33:41.769
IS DELIBERATING RIGHT NOW.

33:41.853 --> 33:45.565
THEIR VOTE WILL PUT ONE ARTIST
UP FOR ELIMINATION.

33:45.648 --> 33:46.691
HEAD BACK TO THE LOFT.

33:46.774 --> 33:50.820
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK
ONCE WE'VE MADE OUR DECISION.

34:00.747 --> 34:01.873
- WHAT THE [bleep]
WAS THAT?

34:01.956 --> 34:04.459
YOU BROUGHT MY NAME
INTO YOUR CRITIQUE.

34:04.542 --> 34:06.502
DUDE, YOU JUST [bleep]
LOOK LIKE A CHUMP.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.963
- WHAT'S YOUR DEAL, JIME?
I CAN'T HAVE A GOOD MOMENT?

34:09.047 --> 34:10.715
YOU KNOW,
I KICKED ASS ON THE TATTOO.

34:10.797 --> 34:14.051
- YOU DREW A STARFISH.
AWESOME.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.803
YOU THINK SOMEONE
SHOULD PAT YOU ON THE BACK

34:15.887 --> 34:18.056
FOR A SIMPLE DRAWING
THAT TOOK SIX HOURS?

34:18.139 --> 34:20.725
I'M TIRED OF JOSH GETTING
THIS FAR IN THE COMPETITION

34:20.808 --> 34:22.101
BY HALF-ASSING EVERYTHING,

34:22.185 --> 34:24.145
AND I'M TIRED OF JUST
LISTENING TO HIS BULL[bleep].

34:24.228 --> 34:25.688
"OH, I'M GONNA [bleep]
DO THIS STRATEGICALLY.

34:25.772 --> 34:26.773
I'M GONNA DO THIS.
IT'S A COMPETITION."

34:26.856 --> 34:28.900
- IT'S A COMPETITION.
WE'RE HERE TO WIN MONEY.

34:28.983 --> 34:30.650
- YOU TRY TO PLAY
SOME LITTLE [bleep] HEAD GAME,

34:30.735 --> 34:31.735
AND IT DIDN'T WORK.
- I MEAN,

34:31.819 --> 34:33.154
I FELT LIKE I HAD TOO, UH--
- TO WHAT?

34:33.237 --> 34:33.821
DUDE, WHAT THE [bleep]
DID I HAVE TO DO

34:33.905 --> 34:36.616
WITH ANY OF YOUR [bleep]?

34:36.699 --> 34:39.577
DUDE, I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR [bleep] CRITIQUE,

34:39.659 --> 34:41.161
BUT YOU BROUGHT ME INTO IT.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.496
- THAT WAS
A BIG MISTAKE THEN.

34:42.580 --> 34:43.831
I SHOULD HAVE KEPT
MY [bleep] MOUTH SHUT ABOUT IT.

34:43.915 --> 34:45.291
- "DUDE, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS, MAN.

34:45.373 --> 34:46.501
"IT WASN'T MY INTENTION
TO DO THIS.

34:46.583 --> 34:47.502
I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT."

34:47.585 --> 34:49.085
YOU BECOME ONE PERSON
ONE SECOND,

34:49.170 --> 34:50.338
ANOTHER PERSON ANOTHER.

34:50.420 --> 34:52.047
YOU'RE ABOUT ONE OF
THE MOST PHONIEST [bleep] PEOPLE

34:52.130 --> 34:53.007
I'VE EVER SEEN.

34:53.090 --> 34:55.676
DUDE, YOU'RE JUST,
LIKE, A DICKHEAD.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.930
LIKE, A [bleep] DICKHEAD.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.688
- ALL RIGHT, TODAY,
WE DID CELTIC TATTOOS.

35:07.772 --> 35:09.899
WE FOCUSED ON LINE.

35:09.982 --> 35:12.652
JOEY DID A NICE, COLORFUL
CELTIC PIECE.

35:12.735 --> 35:13.903
- I THINK
IT'S A SUPER CLEAN TATTOO.

35:13.986 --> 35:15.112
AS FAR AS THE CHALLENGES--

35:15.196 --> 35:16.864
CELTIC, LINE WORK--
I THINK HE HIT THEM BOTH.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.199
- HOW ABOUT CRAIG,
WHO DID THE ELEPHANT?

35:18.282 --> 35:19.909
- I THOUGHT HIS COMPOSITION
WAS OUTSTANDING.

35:19.992 --> 35:22.119
IT'S A REALLY GRAPHIC,
DYNAMIC DESIGN.

35:22.203 --> 35:25.581
- HOWEVER, IN MY OPINION,
JOSHUA GETS THE NOD

35:25.665 --> 35:26.749
FOR DOING THE RIBS
AS CLEAN AS HE DID IT.

35:26.833 --> 35:28.209
- AND THIS
IS A LOT OF LINES.

35:28.292 --> 35:31.546
THIS DESIGN GOING TO THE CENTER
GETS VERY COMPLEX

35:31.629 --> 35:32.880
AND IT'S VERY PRECISE.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.048
- WHAT ABOUT THE BOTTOM
OF THE DAY?

35:34.132 --> 35:36.134
- CHRIS,
DISAPPOINTING FOR SURE.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.468
- A LOT OF THESE LINES
AREN'T PARALLEL.

35:37.552 --> 35:38.094
A LOT OF THESE LINES
DON'T FOLLOW

35:38.177 --> 35:39.804
WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM.

35:39.887 --> 35:41.097
THOSE THINGS TAKE IT
FROM THE MIDDLE

35:41.180 --> 35:42.390
OF THE ROAD TO THE BOTTOM.

35:42.473 --> 35:43.057
- ALLY FELL SHORT AS WELL.

35:43.140 --> 35:44.392
- THOSE 13s ARE UNPASSABLE.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.728
I CAN THINK OF TEN DIFFERENT
WAYS TO INCORPORATE THE 13s

35:47.812 --> 35:48.896
ON THAT CROSS,
TO MAKE IT WORK.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.231
- YEAH.
- LET'S MOVE ALONG TO JASON.

35:50.314 --> 35:54.152
- THE KNOT WORK IS A MESS.
THE OUTLINING IS A MESS.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.904
- JASON DEFINITELY SHOT HIMSELF
IN THE FOOT IN THIS.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.990
- I THINK WE, UH--
WE HAVE A DECISION, HUH?

35:59.073 --> 36:01.325
- YEAH.

36:01.409 --> 36:02.410
{\an8}- LET'S GET DOWN
TO THE NITTY GRITTY.

36:02.493 --> 36:05.079
{\an8}WE'RE HERE TO PICK
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.622
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, LET'S VOTE.
- THAT'S MINE.

36:06.706 --> 36:07.373
MY ARTIST WAS JASON.

36:07.456 --> 36:09.834
I ASKED
FOR A CELTIC DRAGON.

36:09.917 --> 36:11.752
- I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT IT WAS AT FIRST.

36:11.836 --> 36:12.962
IT JUST LOOKS MESSY.

36:13.045 --> 36:14.046
- IF YOU'RE LOOKING
AT THE BOTTOM

36:14.130 --> 36:15.131
OF THE CELTIC KNOT,

36:15.214 --> 36:16.924
IT LOOKS LIKE
ONE SIDE IS WARPED.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.719
- NO.
- WHO THINKS ALLY?

36:19.802 --> 36:22.096
- THIS IS MINE.
IT'S A MEMORIAL PIECE.

36:22.179 --> 36:23.181
- THE 13s, I THINK,
COULD'VE BEEN DONE IN BLACK.

36:23.264 --> 36:25.725
- IT WOULD HAVE STAND OUT
RIGHT IN THE FLAMES.

36:25.808 --> 36:26.893
- BUT I DIDN'T WANT THAT.
- OH, OKAY.

36:26.976 --> 36:28.185
- THE WHOLE THING WAS,
I DIDN'T WANT

36:28.269 --> 36:30.521
EITHER THE 13s
OR THE CROSS

36:30.605 --> 36:31.689
TO OVERSHADOW
EACH OTHER.

36:31.772 --> 36:33.858
- I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE FLAMING.

36:33.941 --> 36:36.193
- BUT I DIDN'T WANT ONE
TO POP OUT MORE THAN THE OTHER.

36:36.277 --> 36:37.695
THAT'S WHY IT'S JUSTIFIED.

36:37.778 --> 36:38.613
- SOME OF THE POINTS
ON THE CROSS,

36:38.696 --> 36:40.114
SOME OF 'EM ARE VERY SHARP,
AND THEN

36:40.197 --> 36:41.616
SOME OF 'EM ARE ROUNDED.
- SOME ARE ROUNDED.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.159
- AND IT'S COLORED
LIKE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE METAL,

36:43.242 --> 36:45.119
BUT IT LOOKS MORE LIKE
IT WAS MADE OF PLAY-DOH.

36:45.202 --> 36:46.287
- NEXT ONE.

36:46.370 --> 36:49.457
- THIS IS MY ATOMIC PARTICLE
SYMBOL BY JACKIE.

36:49.540 --> 36:51.334
- IF YOU LOOK AT THE LINES
GOING AROUND,

36:51.417 --> 36:52.793
IT'S ACTUALLY GETTING WOBBLY.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.295
- IT LOOKS ALMOST LIKE
A PLAYGROUND RIDE

36:54.378 --> 36:55.254
I WOULDN'T GO ON.

36:55.338 --> 36:56.756
- I WOULD SAY MY LINES
ARE STRONGER

36:56.839 --> 36:58.716
THAN THE LINES ON HIS FLAMES
OR LACK THEREOF.

36:58.799 --> 37:00.217
- BUT THE OTHER THING--
- THEY LOOK UNFINISHED TO ME.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.636
- THE OTHER THING IS,
WITH YOURS,

37:01.719 --> 37:04.805
THOSE LINES ARE SO PROMINENT,
AND IT IS A LINE CHALLENGE.

37:04.889 --> 37:07.308
- THINK OF WHAT JACKIE HAD TO DO
WITH THAT INTRICATE INSIDE...

37:07.391 --> 37:08.768
- THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.
- AND COMPARE IT TO ALLY.

37:08.851 --> 37:10.061
ALLY HAD A CROSS.

37:10.144 --> 37:12.313
THAT CROSS
SHOULD HAVE BEEN PERFECT.

37:12.396 --> 37:13.940
- I MEAN, I AGREE.
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.233
LOOKS LIKE
WE'VE COME TO A DECISION.

37:18.611 --> 37:19.695
[door opening]

37:19.779 --> 37:20.821
- COME ON.

37:20.905 --> 37:24.659
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, WE'VE DECIDED
WE NEED TO SEE JOSHUA,

37:24.742 --> 37:29.497
JASON, ALLY...

37:29.580 --> 37:31.540
AND JOEY.

37:31.624 --> 37:35.127
SEE Y'ALL IN THE SHOP.

37:47.348 --> 37:50.434
- TODAY,
WE TESTED YOUR LINES,

37:50.518 --> 37:53.437
THE MOST ESSENTIAL SKILL
FOR A CELTIC TATTOO.

37:53.521 --> 37:58.025
TWO OF YOU IMPRESSED US.
TWO OF YOU FELL SHORT.

37:58.109 --> 38:02.363
JOSHUA, JOEY, YOUR TATTOOS
WERE THE TWO BEST OF THE DAY.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.489
- JOSHUA, I THINK YOU DID
A REALLY GOOD JOB.

38:03.572 --> 38:05.741
THE CUSTOMER ASKED YOU
FOR SOMETHING REALLY TRICKY,

38:05.825 --> 38:07.702
AND YOU PULLED IT OFF.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.203
VERY IMPRESSIVE.
- THANK YOU.

38:09.286 --> 38:11.831
- JOEY, THE FACT THAT YOURS
HAD SO MUCH CELTIC

38:11.914 --> 38:13.290
AND A LOT OF DETAIL
AND STILL KEPT

38:13.374 --> 38:15.918
TIGHT LINE WORK IN IT,
GOOD JOB.

38:16.002 --> 38:21.090
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED THAT
THE BEST TATTOO OF THE DAY...

38:21.799 --> 38:24.969
GOES TO JOSHUA.

38:25.052 --> 38:26.387
- CONGRATULATIONS, JOSH.

38:26.470 --> 38:28.556
YOU GAVE THE CHALLENGE
EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS

38:28.639 --> 38:29.598
THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR,

38:29.682 --> 38:31.017
A STRAIGHT, CLEAN,
ONE-PASS OUTLINE.

38:31.100 --> 38:32.560
YOU NAILED IT.
GOOD JOB, MAN.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.145
- THANK YOU.

38:34.228 --> 38:37.690
- JASON, ALLY,
FOR ONE OF YOU,

38:37.773 --> 38:41.068
THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE.

38:41.152 --> 38:44.155
ALLY, YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE
THE HUMAN CANVAS JURY

38:44.238 --> 38:48.701
VOTED THAT YOU HAVE
THE WORST TATTOO OF THE DAY.

38:48.784 --> 38:50.411
- I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

38:50.494 --> 38:52.204
- TODAY,
IN THE OUTLINE CHALLENGE,

38:52.288 --> 38:53.247
YOU CAME UP REALLY SHORT.

38:53.330 --> 38:55.708
- THIS IS DEFINITELY
NOT THE TYPE OF WORK

38:55.791 --> 38:56.959
I'M USED TO PUTTING OUT.

38:57.043 --> 38:58.753
I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET

38:58.836 --> 39:00.046
TO SOME
OF THE REALISM CHALLENGES,

39:00.129 --> 39:01.672
'CAUSE THAT'S
WHERE I SHINE.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.299
- THE IDEA IS TO BE GOOD
AT ALL OF IT

39:03.382 --> 39:04.175
AND DO THE TATTOO
THAT COMES IN THE DOOR.

39:04.258 --> 39:06.927
- I'M NOT SAYING
I JUST DO REALISM.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.179
I DO ALL DIFFERENT STYLES.

39:08.262 --> 39:11.265
- MAYBE WHAT'S BEST FOR YOU
IS TO HANG OUT IN A STREET SHOP

39:11.348 --> 39:13.726
AND TO LEARN
THE ABCs OF TATTOOING.

39:13.809 --> 39:17.229
- IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING
I'LL LOOK INTO.

39:18.272 --> 39:19.940
- JASON.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.358
THE MAIN THING
ABOUT THIS TATTOO, MAN,

39:21.442 --> 39:23.069
IS JUST
ALL THE LINE MISTAKES

39:23.152 --> 39:24.236
DRAWS YOU
STRAIGHT TO THE BOTTOM.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.739
- I COULD GO INTO
ALL MY WOES AND PROBLEMS

39:26.822 --> 39:28.157
WITH ALL THE CHALLENGES
THAT I'VE HAD

39:28.240 --> 39:29.408
WITH PANIC DISORDER
AND ANXIETY,

39:29.492 --> 39:31.535
AND TRYING TO JUST EVEN
GET OUT THE DOOR SOME DAY.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.747
- YOU'VE GOT TO BE ABLE
TO FIND A COMFORTABLE PLACE

39:34.830 --> 39:38.292
WITHIN THIS ARENA THAT YOU CAN
JUST OPERATE AT YOUR MAXIMUM.

39:38.375 --> 39:40.002
- I KNOW I CAN DO BETTER.

39:40.086 --> 39:44.381
- THE JUDGES HAVE DECIDED.

39:49.553 --> 39:51.472
ALLY,

39:51.555 --> 39:54.642
YOU DO NOT HAVE WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE INK MASTER.

39:54.725 --> 39:58.187
- I THINK THE BIGGEST THING
AGAINST YOU IS EXPERIENCE.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.355
IF YOU HAD ANOTHER DECADE
IN THE BUSINESS,

39:59.438 --> 40:02.066
YOU WOULD BE A LOT MORE
COMFORTABLE AND CONFIDENT

40:02.149 --> 40:03.275
IN EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.819
THAT'S WHERE
YOU'RE FALLING SHORT.

40:04.902 --> 40:08.239
- PLEASE PACK YOUR MACHINES
AND CLOSE SHOP.

40:11.575 --> 40:12.451
- IT'S JUST DISAPPOINTING.

40:12.535 --> 40:15.579
WITH THE SKIN THAT I HAD,
I COULDN'T WIN.

40:15.663 --> 40:17.498
I WAS OFF MY GAME
IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD.

40:17.581 --> 40:21.252
I FEEL LIKE I DIDN'T
PROPERLY REPRESENT MYSELF.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.007
announcer: ON THE NEXT EPISODE
OF <i> INK MASTER...</i>

40:27.091 --> 40:29.135
- FOR THIS FLASH CHALLENGE,

40:29.218 --> 40:31.303
YOU MUST TRANSFORM
GNARLY SCARS...

40:31.387 --> 40:33.514

- INTO PHENOMENAL TATTOOS.

40:33.597 --> 40:36.225

OH, MY GOD, YO.

YOU'RE IN THIS GAME TO TRIP

40:38.811 --> 40:41.230

GET THE [bleep] OUTTA HERE.

40:42.982 --> 40:43.941
- DOUCHEBAG.

40:44.024 --> 40:46.026
- I'M JUST CHOKING.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.027
- IT'S TIME
TO PICK YOURSELF BACK UP.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.196
- IT GETS HARDER AND HARDER
TO PULL MYSELF

40:49.280 --> 40:50.656
OUT OF THIS [bleep] HOLE.

40:50.739 --> 40:51.657
- YOU SCREWED YOURSELF.
WHAT HAPPENED?

40:51.740 --> 40:55.244
GET READY, 'CAUSE THIS
IS A ROUGH [bleep] DAY.
