01:38.480 --> 01:41.460
Edmund! Get away from there!

01:41.560 --> 01:44.160
Peter! What do you think you're doing?

01:44.270 --> 01:45.960
Peter, quickly, the shelter. Now!

01:46.070 --> 01:47.330
- Come on!
- Wait...

01:47.440 --> 01:49.060
Come on, leave it!

01:50.740 --> 01:53.470
Mommy!

01:54.940 --> 01:56.930
Lucy, come on!

01:58.450 --> 02:00.040
- Come on, quickly!
- Run!

02:00.150 --> 02:01.878
Run!

02:03.448 --> 02:05.818
- Hurry!
- Mum!

02:05.918 --> 02:08.747
- Wait! Dad!
- Ed!

02:08.858 --> 02:11.418
- Edmund, no!
- I'll get him!

02:11.528 --> 02:14.858
- Peter, come back!
- Ed! Come here!

02:14.958 --> 02:17.988
Edmund! Get down!

02:18.098 --> 02:21.188
Come on, you idiot, run!

02:21.298 --> 02:22.738
Get out!

02:28.038 --> 02:29.808
Come on!

02:32.348 --> 02:33.608
Hurry!

02:34.748 --> 02:37.778
Why can't you think of anyone
but yourself? You're so selfish!

02:37.888 --> 02:40.878
- You could've got us killed!
- Stop it!

02:40.988 --> 02:44.218
It's OK. Shh.

02:48.226 --> 02:50.756
Why can't you just do as you're told?

03:00.236 --> 03:04.006
Alms for the poor.
Alms for the poor.

03:04.106 --> 03:05.406
God bless you, sir.

03:05.506 --> 03:07.676
Children
and evacuation staff...

03:07.776 --> 03:11.616
You need to keep this on, darling.
All right?

03:11.716 --> 03:14.116
You warm enough? Good girl.

03:14.216 --> 03:18.676
Say hello to Auntie Laura.
Goodbye, darling, we love you.

03:19.256 --> 03:21.316
If Dad were here,
he wouldn't make us go.

03:21.426 --> 03:24.486
If Dad were here, it'd mean the war
was over and we wouldn't have to.

03:24.596 --> 03:27.186
You will listen to your brother,
won't you, Edmund?

03:42.014 --> 03:44.874
Promise me you'll look after the others.

03:44.984 --> 03:46.504
I will, Mum.

03:49.384 --> 03:54.254
- Good man.
- All aboard! All aboard!

03:54.354 --> 03:56.584
- Bye, darling!
- Bye!

03:56.694 --> 03:59.284
Susan.

04:00.834 --> 04:03.294
Be a big girl.

04:03.404 --> 04:06.734
Hold on to your brother's hand.
Don't let it go.

04:07.734 --> 04:11.294
All right. Off you go.

04:11.404 --> 04:15.364
- All aboard!
- Bye-bye. Love you.

04:19.281 --> 04:23.442
Hey, get off. I know
how to get on a train by myself.

04:23.552 --> 04:25.382
Get off me!

04:27.152 --> 04:29.812
May I have your tickets, please?
Tickets, please.

04:29.922 --> 04:30.892
Peter.

04:30.992 --> 04:35.792
- That's right. On you go.
- Yes. Thank you.

04:37.362 --> 04:40.732
Come along.
Come along this way, please.

04:41.632 --> 04:44.472
Come on, Lucy.
We have to stick together now.

04:44.572 --> 04:48.902
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be fine.

04:49.012 --> 04:53.672
Bye, Mommy! I love you!

05:05.420 --> 05:09.330
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Bye! We'll miss you! See you soon.

05:09.430 --> 05:11.950
- I love you, Mum! Bye!
- See you soon!

05:12.060 --> 05:14.970
- Write to us, Mum!
- Love you!

06:14.358 --> 06:17.588
Goosey Station. Goosey Station.

06:23.668 --> 06:27.728
Give me your hand. Let's get going.

07:29.224 --> 07:32.424
The professor knew we were coming.

07:32.534 --> 07:35.094
Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled.

07:35.204 --> 07:38.174
Come on, hup!

07:42.804 --> 07:46.334
And whoa. Whoa.

07:51.084 --> 07:54.414
- Mrs. Macready?
- I'm afraid so.

07:56.254 --> 07:59.784
Is this it, then?
Haven't you brought anything else?

07:59.894 --> 08:01.822
No, ma'am.

08:02.492 --> 08:04.022
It's just us.

08:05.332 --> 08:08.132
Small favors.

08:09.202 --> 08:14.162
Come on.
Good girl. Come on. Come on.

08:27.852 --> 08:32.182
Professor Kirke is not accustomed
to havin' children in this house.

08:32.292 --> 08:36.352
And, as such, there are a few rules
we need to follow.

08:36.462 --> 08:38.452
There will no shoutin'.

08:38.562 --> 08:42.861
Or runnin'.
No improper use of the dumbwaiter.

08:42.962 --> 08:45.932
No touchin' of the historical artifacts!

08:48.840 --> 08:50.670
And above all,

08:50.770 --> 08:56.010
there shall be no disturbin'
of the professor.

09:04.890 --> 09:07.860
German aircraft
carried out a number of attacks

09:07.960 --> 09:09.510
on Great Britain last night.

09:09.620 --> 09:11.920
The raids, which lasted
for several hours...

09:17.930 --> 09:20.460
The sheets feel scratchy.

09:21.170 --> 09:25.570
Wars don't last forever, Lucy.
We'll be home soon.

09:25.670 --> 09:29.340
- Yeah, if home's still there.
- Isn't it time you were in bed?

09:29.440 --> 09:31.778
- Yes, Mum.
- Ed!

09:33.678 --> 09:37.978
You saw outside.
This place is huge.

09:38.088 --> 09:40.078
We can do whatever we want here.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.658
Tomorrow's going to be great.

09:43.588 --> 09:44.958
Really.

09:49.698 --> 09:53.458
"Gastrovascular."

09:55.298 --> 09:58.198
Come on, Peter. Gastrovascular.

09:58.308 --> 10:01.538
- Is it Latin?
- Yes.

10:01.638 --> 10:05.368
Is it Latin for
"worst game ever invented"?

10:07.578 --> 10:10.018
We could play hide and seek.

10:11.318 --> 10:14.348
But we're already having so much fun.

10:15.218 --> 10:18.276
Come on, Peter, please.

10:18.386 --> 10:20.826
Pretty please?

10:21.326 --> 10:25.786
- One, two, three, four...
- What?

10:27.966 --> 10:30.766
...five, six, seven, eight,

10:30.866 --> 10:34.596
nine, ten, 11...

10:46.446 --> 10:49.286
...24, 25, 26...

11:05.104 --> 11:06.324
I was here first!

12:08.392 --> 12:13.892
...75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80,

12:14.002 --> 12:18.962
81, 82, 83, 84,

12:19.072 --> 12:23.102
- 85, 86, 85, 86, 87, 88...

12:23.212 --> 12:27.472
...89, 90, 91, 92,

12:27.582 --> 12:31.212
93, 94, 95...

15:23.754 --> 15:26.114
Were you hiding from me?

15:30.524 --> 15:31.992
No.

15:32.092 --> 15:34.022
Uh, well...

15:35.362 --> 15:36.912
I just... I...

15:37.032 --> 15:39.822
No. No. I-I-I just...

15:39.932 --> 15:42.802
I was just, um...
I didn't want to scare you.

15:45.072 --> 15:49.872
If you don't mind my asking...
what are you?

15:49.972 --> 15:53.372
Well, I'm a...
Well, I'm a faun.

15:53.482 --> 15:54.842
And what about you?

15:54.942 --> 15:58.142
You must be some kind of
beardless dwarf?

15:58.252 --> 16:01.222
I'm not a dwarf! I'm a girl!

16:03.052 --> 16:07.452
And, actually, I'm tallest in my class.

16:11.562 --> 16:14.192
You mean to say that
you're a Daughter of Eve?

16:14.302 --> 16:16.492
Well, my mum's name is Helen.

16:16.602 --> 16:21.370
Yes, but you are in fact human.

16:21.470 --> 16:24.340
Yes, of course.

16:26.010 --> 16:27.630
What are you doing here?

16:27.740 --> 16:31.340
Well, I was hiding in the wardrobe
in the spare room, and...

16:31.450 --> 16:33.540
Spare Oom? Is that in Narnia?

16:33.650 --> 16:36.080
Narnia? What's that?

16:37.190 --> 16:39.710
Well, dear girl,
you're in it.

16:39.820 --> 16:42.190
Everything from the lamppost

16:42.290 --> 16:45.730
all the way to Castle Cair Paravel
on the Eastern Ocean,

16:45.830 --> 16:48.490
every stick and stone you see,

16:48.600 --> 16:52.190
every icicle is Narnia.

16:53.740 --> 16:57.190
This is an awfully big wardrobe.

16:57.310 --> 17:00.070
War Drobe? I'm sorry.

17:00.180 --> 17:04.078
Please allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Tumnus.

17:04.178 --> 17:08.117
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Tumnus.
I'm Lucy Pevensie.

17:11.948 --> 17:16.188
- Oh, you shake it.
- Uh... Why?

17:16.988 --> 17:20.088
I... I don't know.

17:20.198 --> 17:22.428
People do it when they meet each other.

17:30.868 --> 17:36.138
Well, then, Lucy Pevensie
from the shining city of War Drobe

17:36.238 --> 17:39.148
in the wondrous land of Spare Oom,

17:39.248 --> 17:44.008
how would it be if you came
and had tea with me?

17:44.118 --> 17:46.848
Well, thank you very much, but I...

17:48.256 --> 17:50.546
I probably should be getting back.

17:50.656 --> 17:55.246
It's only just around the corner.
And there'll be a glorious fire

17:55.356 --> 17:58.816
with toast and tea and cakes.

17:58.926 --> 18:02.386
And, perhaps, we'll even
break into the sardines.

18:03.336 --> 18:06.666
- I don't know.
- Come on.

18:06.766 --> 18:09.896
It's not every day
that I get to make a new friend.

18:10.006 --> 18:15.416
Well, I suppose I could come
for a little while.

18:15.516 --> 18:16.876
If you have sardines.

18:17.946 --> 18:19.676
By the bucketload.

18:31.426 --> 18:33.824
- You all right?
- Mm-hm.

18:41.334 --> 18:42.824
Well, here we are.

18:42.934 --> 18:45.134
Come along.

18:51.244 --> 18:53.444
- After you.
- May I help you with that?

18:53.544 --> 18:56.314
- Thank you very much.
- Oh.

19:04.694 --> 19:06.624
Oh.

19:13.564 --> 19:15.764
Now, that... that is my father.

19:17.042 --> 19:19.162
He has a nice face.

19:19.942 --> 19:21.402
He looks a lot like you.

19:22.872 --> 19:24.572
No.

19:24.682 --> 19:27.582
No, I'm not very much
like him at all, really.

19:27.682 --> 19:31.082
My father's fighting in the war.

19:32.722 --> 19:35.952
My father went away to war too.

19:36.792 --> 19:39.882
But that was a long, long time ago.

19:40.362 --> 19:44.192
- Before this dreadful winter.
- Winter's not all bad.

19:44.302 --> 19:48.792
There's ice skating and snowball fights.

19:48.902 --> 19:52.772
- Oh! And Christmas!
- Not here.

19:52.872 --> 19:57.812
No. No, we haven't had a Christmas
in a hundred years.

19:57.912 --> 20:01.642
What? No presents for a hundred years?

20:01.752 --> 20:04.180
Always winter, never Christmas.

20:04.280 --> 20:07.150
It's been a long winter.

20:07.890 --> 20:11.340
But you would have loved Narnia
in summer.

20:12.120 --> 20:15.720
We fauns danced
with the dryads all night,

20:15.830 --> 20:19.760
and, you know, we never got tired.

20:19.860 --> 20:24.800
And music. Oh, such music!

20:25.870 --> 20:29.270
Would... would you
like to hear some now?

20:30.170 --> 20:32.900
Oh! Yes, please.

20:36.810 --> 20:40.180
Now, are you familiar

20:40.280 --> 20:44.150
- with any Narnian lullabies?
- Sorry, no.

20:44.260 --> 20:46.380
Well, that's good.

20:46.660 --> 20:51.588
Because this... probably
won't sound anything like one.

22:16.606 --> 22:19.164
- Oh, I should go.
- It's too late for that now.

22:20.844 --> 22:23.284
I'm such a terrible faun.

22:26.684 --> 22:28.984
Oh, no.

22:29.084 --> 22:31.814
You're the nicest faun I've ever met.

22:31.924 --> 22:35.484
Then I'm afraid you've had
a very poor sampling.

22:35.594 --> 22:40.084
No. You can't have done
anything that bad.

22:42.064 --> 22:46.304
It's not something I have done,
Lucy Pevensie.

22:46.904 --> 22:48.994
It's something I am doing.

22:49.104 --> 22:50.804
What are you doing?

22:51.614 --> 22:55.204
I'm kidnapping you.

22:55.314 --> 22:57.004
It was the White Witch.

22:57.114 --> 22:59.604
She's the one who makes it
always winter, always cold.

22:59.714 --> 23:01.244
She gave orders.

23:01.354 --> 23:04.652
If any of us ever find a human
wandering in the woods,

23:04.752 --> 23:07.082
we're supposed to turn it over to her.

23:07.892 --> 23:10.762
But, Mr. Tumnus, you wouldn't.

23:15.732 --> 23:18.822
I thought you were my friend.

23:22.702 --> 23:26.232
Now. She may already know you're here.

23:26.342 --> 23:29.002
The woods are full of her spies.

23:31.612 --> 23:34.552
Even some of the trees are on her side.

23:38.552 --> 23:41.182
Can you find your way back from here?

23:41.292 --> 23:44.422
- I think so.
- All right.

23:47.700 --> 23:51.500
Will you be all right?

23:52.230 --> 23:55.430
Hey, hey, hey.

23:55.540 --> 23:59.340
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

24:01.810 --> 24:03.570
Here.

24:04.980 --> 24:09.010
Keep it. You need it more than I do.

24:12.690 --> 24:14.920
No matter what happens,
Lucy Pevensie,

24:15.020 --> 24:17.460
I am glad to have met you.

24:17.560 --> 24:20.620
You've made me feel warmer
than I've felt in a hundred years.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.850
Now go.

24:23.970 --> 24:25.490
Go!

24:35.338 --> 24:38.368
...99, 100.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.808
Ready or not, here I come!

24:39.908 --> 24:43.148
It's all right! I'm back! I'm all right!

24:43.248 --> 24:45.618
Shut up! He's coming!

24:49.388 --> 24:52.788
You know, I'm not sure you two
have quite got the idea of this game.

24:52.888 --> 24:55.378
Weren't you wondering where I was?

24:55.498 --> 24:58.658
That's the point.
That was why he was seeking you.

24:58.768 --> 25:00.098
Does this mean I win?

25:00.198 --> 25:02.328
I don't think Lucy
wants to play anymore.

25:02.438 --> 25:04.898
I've been gone for hours.

25:19.286 --> 25:22.276
Lucy, the only wood in here
is the back of the wardrobe.

25:22.386 --> 25:26.546
One game at a time, Lu.
We don't all have your imagination.

25:30.496 --> 25:33.586
But I wasn't imagining!

25:33.696 --> 25:35.396
That's enough, Lucy.

25:35.496 --> 25:37.896
I wouldn't lie about this!

25:38.006 --> 25:39.696
Well, I believe you.

25:40.566 --> 25:43.036
- You do?
- Yeah, of course.

25:43.136 --> 25:45.666
Didn't I tell you about
the field in the cupboards?

25:45.776 --> 25:47.906
Will you just stop?

25:48.016 --> 25:50.606
You just have to make
everything worse, don't you?

25:50.716 --> 25:53.616
- It was just a joke!
- When are you gonna learn to grow up?

25:53.716 --> 25:56.986
Shut up! You think you're Dad,
but you're not!

26:00.556 --> 26:03.044
Well, that was nicely handled.

26:04.964 --> 26:09.224
But... it really was there.

26:09.334 --> 26:12.354
Susan's right, Lucy.

26:12.464 --> 26:14.364
That's enough.

27:50.160 --> 27:51.990
Lucy.

27:52.830 --> 27:54.890
Where are you?

27:57.300 --> 27:58.860
Boo!

28:05.680 --> 28:07.640
Lucy.

28:09.510 --> 28:11.910
Hope you're not afraid of the dark.

28:17.958 --> 28:19.578
Lucy?

28:25.228 --> 28:27.058
Lucy?

28:28.568 --> 28:30.118
Lucy!

28:48.648 --> 28:50.478
Lucy.

28:51.488 --> 28:53.388
Where are you?

28:55.058 --> 28:56.748
Lucy.

28:57.898 --> 29:00.298
I think I believe you now.

29:26.156 --> 29:27.776
Lucy.

29:44.706 --> 29:45.896
Lucy?

29:52.574 --> 29:53.804
Oh!

30:15.404 --> 30:17.964
- Leave me alone!
- What is it now, Ginarrbrik?

30:18.074 --> 30:20.304
Make him let me go!
I didn't do anything wrong!

30:20.404 --> 30:22.774
How dare you address
the Queen of Narnia?

30:22.874 --> 30:24.704
I didn't know!

30:24.814 --> 30:27.834
- You will know her better hereafter!
- Wait!

30:38.422 --> 30:41.482
What is your name, Son of Adam?

30:41.592 --> 30:43.822
Uh, Edmund.

30:43.922 --> 30:47.992
And how, Edmund,
did you come to enter my dominion?

30:48.102 --> 30:52.052
I'm not sure.
I was just following my sister.

30:52.172 --> 30:55.802
- Your sister? How many are you?
- Four.

30:55.902 --> 30:58.632
Lucy's the only one
that's been here before.

30:58.742 --> 31:02.642
She said she met some faun
called Tumnus.

31:02.742 --> 31:05.772
Peter and Susan didn't believe her.
I didn't either.

31:05.882 --> 31:10.542
Edmund, you look so cold.
Will you come and sit with me?

31:26.500 --> 31:29.400
Now, how about something hot to drink?

31:30.670 --> 31:34.300
Yes, please, Your Majesty.

31:51.330 --> 31:54.090
Your drink, sire.

31:54.190 --> 31:56.290
How did you do that?

31:56.400 --> 31:58.420
I can make anything you like.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.890
Can you make me taller?

32:02.000 --> 32:04.988
Anything you'd like to eat.

32:06.468 --> 32:08.668
Turkish delight?

32:34.198 --> 32:35.928
Edmund?

32:36.038 --> 32:39.268
I would very much like to meet
the rest of your family.

32:39.368 --> 32:41.308
Why?

32:41.908 --> 32:44.278
They're nothing special.

32:44.338 --> 32:50.306
Oh, I'm sure they're not nearly
as delightful as you are.

32:51.886 --> 32:55.906
But you see, Edmund,
I have no children of my own.

32:56.016 --> 32:57.956
And you are exactly the sort of boy

32:58.056 --> 33:03.356
who I could see, one day,
becoming Prince of Narnia.

33:03.726 --> 33:05.986
Maybe even King.

33:07.126 --> 33:09.066
Really?

33:09.836 --> 33:12.326
Of course, you'd have
to bring your family.

33:12.436 --> 33:13.696
Oh.

33:13.806 --> 33:17.236
Do you mean,
Peter would be king too?

33:17.336 --> 33:19.896
No! No, no.

33:20.676 --> 33:23.706
But a king needs servants.

33:24.986 --> 33:27.416
I guess I could bring 'em.

33:31.786 --> 33:34.884
Beyond these woods,
you see those two hills?

33:34.994 --> 33:38.114
My house is right between them.

33:38.224 --> 33:40.164
You'd love it there, Edmund.

33:40.264 --> 33:44.564
It has whole rooms
simply stuffed with Turkish delight.

33:44.664 --> 33:47.894
- Couldn't I have some more now?
- No!

33:50.534 --> 33:52.834
Don't want to ruin your appetite.

33:52.944 --> 33:56.574
Besides, you and I are going to be
seeing each other again very soon.

33:56.674 --> 33:59.804
I hope so, Your Majesty.

34:00.684 --> 34:05.084
Until then, dear one.
Mmm, I'm gonna miss you.

34:06.884 --> 34:10.293
Yah! Yah! Yah!

34:17.764 --> 34:19.462
Edmund?

34:20.702 --> 34:23.462
Oh, Edmund! You got in too!

34:23.572 --> 34:26.202
Isn't it wonderful?

34:26.302 --> 34:30.502
- Where have you been?
- With Mr. Tumnus. He's fine.

34:30.612 --> 34:34.442
The White Witch hasn't found out
anything about him meeting me.

34:34.552 --> 34:35.911
The White Witch?

34:36.752 --> 34:40.652
She calls herself the Queen of Narnia,
but she really isn't.

34:42.292 --> 34:45.411
Are you all right? You look awful.

34:45.522 --> 34:49.422
Well, what'd you expect?
I mean, it's freezing.

34:49.532 --> 34:53.161
- How do we get out of here?
- Come on.

34:53.262 --> 34:54.862
This way.

34:57.072 --> 34:59.542
Peter, Peter, wake up!
Peter, wake up!

34:59.642 --> 35:01.502
- It's there! It's really there!
- Shh.

35:01.612 --> 35:04.440
- Lucy, what are you talking about?
- Narnia!

35:04.540 --> 35:06.870
It's all in the wardrobe
like I told you!

35:06.980 --> 35:10.040
- You've just been dreaming, Lucy.
- But I haven't!

35:10.150 --> 35:14.110
I saw Mr. Tumnus again!
And this time Edmund went too.

35:17.320 --> 35:20.590
You... You saw the faun?

35:23.660 --> 35:27.390
Well, he didn't actually
go there with me.

35:27.760 --> 35:30.360
He...

35:33.440 --> 35:35.460
What were you doing, Edmund?

35:38.010 --> 35:40.100
I was just playing along.

35:41.350 --> 35:42.810
I'm sorry, Peter.

35:42.910 --> 35:45.310
I shouldn't have encouraged her,

35:45.420 --> 35:48.318
but you know what little children
are like these days.

35:48.418 --> 35:52.008
They just don't know
when to stop pretending.

35:58.858 --> 36:00.488
Ow!

36:01.398 --> 36:04.198
Oh!

36:09.868 --> 36:13.498
You children are one shenanigan
shy of sleepin' in the stable!

36:14.608 --> 36:20.548
Professor. I'm sorry. I told them
you were not to be disturbed.

36:20.648 --> 36:23.948
It's all right, Mrs. Macready.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

36:25.258 --> 36:28.518
But first of all, I think this one
is in need of a little hot chocolate.

36:28.628 --> 36:31.918
Come along, dear.

36:39.096 --> 36:43.656
You seem to have upset the delicate
internal balance of my housekeeper.

36:43.766 --> 36:46.566
We're very sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

36:46.676 --> 36:49.036
It's our sister, sir. Lucy.

36:49.146 --> 36:52.206
- The weeping girl.
- Yes, sir.

36:52.316 --> 36:55.246
- She's upset.
- Hence the weeping.

36:55.346 --> 36:56.746
It's nothing.

36:56.846 --> 36:59.716
- We can handle it.
- Oh, I can see that.

37:01.626 --> 37:04.316
She thinks she's found a magical land.

37:04.426 --> 37:07.256
In the upstairs wardrobe.

37:09.266 --> 37:10.956
What did you say?

37:11.066 --> 37:15.326
Um, the wardrobe, upstairs.

37:15.436 --> 37:17.866
Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.

37:17.966 --> 37:20.134
She won't stop going on about it.

37:21.074 --> 37:24.604
- What was it like?
- Like talking to a lunatic.

37:24.714 --> 37:27.174
No, no, no, not her.
The forest.

37:27.274 --> 37:30.714
- You're not saying you believe her?
- You don't?

37:30.814 --> 37:32.244
But of course not.

37:32.354 --> 37:34.844
I mean, logically, it's impossible.

37:34.954 --> 37:37.784
What do they teach in schools
these days?

37:37.884 --> 37:39.784
Edmund said they were only pretending.

37:39.894 --> 37:41.914
He's usually the more
truthful one, is he?

37:42.024 --> 37:45.894
No. This would be the first time.

37:45.994 --> 37:48.054
Well, if she's not mad
and she's not lying,

37:48.164 --> 37:52.664
then logically we must assume
she's telling the truth.

37:53.134 --> 37:56.304
You're saying that we
should just believe her?

37:57.874 --> 38:01.934
She's your sister, isn't she?
You're her family.

38:04.112 --> 38:06.912
You might just try acting like one.

38:07.482 --> 38:11.472
Peter winds up,
poised to take yet another wicket!

38:11.592 --> 38:13.212
Ow!

38:13.322 --> 38:17.122
Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream.

38:17.992 --> 38:20.122
Why can't we play hide and seek again?

38:20.232 --> 38:22.822
I thought you said it was a kid's game.

38:22.932 --> 38:27.302
Besides, we could all use the fresh air.

38:27.402 --> 38:30.102
It's not like there isn't air inside.

38:31.342 --> 38:34.872
- Are you ready?
- Are you?

38:51.060 --> 38:53.460
- Well done, Ed.
- You bowled it!

38:53.560 --> 38:56.460
- What on earth is goin' on?
- The Macready!

38:56.560 --> 38:58.160
Come on!

39:05.710 --> 39:07.640
No, no, back, back, back!

39:34.128 --> 39:37.928
- Come on!
- Oh, you've got to be joking.

39:50.248 --> 39:51.378
Get back!

39:51.448 --> 39:54.388
- My toe!
- I'm not on your toe!

39:54.488 --> 39:57.288
- Move back.
- Will you stop shoving?

40:09.038 --> 40:12.228
Impossible.

40:14.438 --> 40:15.868
Don't worry.

40:15.978 --> 40:19.426
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

40:19.546 --> 40:22.666
I don't suppose
saying we're sorry

40:22.776 --> 40:26.046
- would quite cover it.
- No. It wouldn't.

40:28.856 --> 40:31.086
- But that might!
- Oh!

40:33.756 --> 40:36.226
Oh!

40:38.726 --> 40:40.256
Ow!

40:41.066 --> 40:42.896
Stop it!

40:44.166 --> 40:45.966
You little liar.

40:46.066 --> 40:50.266
- You didn't believe her, either.
- Apologize to Lucy.

40:51.646 --> 40:55.336
- Say you're sorry.
- All right! I'm sorry.

40:55.446 --> 40:57.376
That's all right.

40:57.476 --> 41:00.446
Some children just don't know
when to stop pretending.

41:00.546 --> 41:01.986
Oh, very funny.

41:02.086 --> 41:03.914
Maybe we should go back.

41:04.014 --> 41:07.474
But shouldn't we at least
take a look around?

41:07.584 --> 41:09.284
I think Lucy should decide.

41:10.894 --> 41:14.054
I'd like you all to meet Mr. Tumnus!

41:14.164 --> 41:16.324
Well, then Mr. Tumnus it is.

41:17.434 --> 41:20.764
But we can't go hiking in the snow
dressed like this.

41:20.864 --> 41:21.834
No.

41:23.734 --> 41:27.404
But I'm sure the professor
wouldn't mind us using these.

41:27.504 --> 41:31.804
Anyway, if you think about it logically,

41:31.914 --> 41:34.274
we're not even taking them
out of the wardrobe.

41:34.384 --> 41:37.514
- But that's a girl's coat!
- I know.

42:21.732 --> 42:25.822
...lots and lots of lovely food,
and we'll have lots and lots of...

42:28.932 --> 42:30.332
Lu?

42:32.302 --> 42:33.670
Lucy!

42:51.190 --> 42:54.350
Who would do something like this?

43:11.570 --> 43:15.010
"The Faun Tumnus is hereby charged

43:15.110 --> 43:19.168
with High Treason
against Her lmperial Majesty,

43:19.278 --> 43:22.218
Jadis, Queen of Narnia,

43:22.318 --> 43:25.578
for comforting her enemies
and fraternizing with humans.

43:25.688 --> 43:29.128
Signed Maugrim,
Captain of the Secret Police.

43:29.228 --> 43:31.318
Long Live the Queen."

43:32.628 --> 43:35.828
All right.
Now we really should go back.

43:35.928 --> 43:37.558
But what about Mr. Tumnus?

43:37.668 --> 43:40.498
If he was arrested just
for being with a human,

43:40.598 --> 43:44.468
- I don't think there's much we can do.
- You don't understand, do you?

43:45.708 --> 43:47.798
I'm the human.

43:47.908 --> 43:50.308
She must have found out
he helped me.

43:50.408 --> 43:53.938
- Maybe we could call the police.
- These are the police.

43:54.048 --> 43:56.248
Don't worry, Lu.
We'll think of something.

43:56.348 --> 43:58.178
Why?

43:58.858 --> 44:00.448
I mean, he's a criminal.

44:00.958 --> 44:03.258
Psst.

44:05.526 --> 44:08.756
Did that bird just "psst" us?

44:51.364 --> 44:54.494
It... It's a beaver.

45:00.444 --> 45:02.434
Here, boy.

45:02.544 --> 45:04.514
Here, boy.

45:08.384 --> 45:11.714
I ain't gonna smell it,
if that's what you want.

45:11.824 --> 45:13.124
Oh.

45:13.224 --> 45:14.554
Sorry.

45:14.924 --> 45:17.554
Lucy Pevensie?

45:22.164 --> 45:23.724
Yes?

45:33.114 --> 45:35.302
Hey, that's the hankie
I gave to Mr. Tum...

45:35.412 --> 45:38.472
Tumnus. He got it to me
just before they took him.

45:38.582 --> 45:39.942
Is he all right?

45:40.812 --> 45:42.752
Further in.

45:44.682 --> 45:47.552
- What are you doing?
- She's right.

45:47.652 --> 45:50.212
How do we know we can trust him?

45:50.322 --> 45:52.022
He said he knows the faun.

45:52.132 --> 45:56.082
He's a beaver.
He shouldn't be saying anything!

45:56.202 --> 45:57.892
Everything all right?

45:58.002 --> 46:00.262
Yes. We were just talking.

46:00.372 --> 46:03.392
That's better left
for safer quarters.

46:04.502 --> 46:06.602
He means the trees.

46:21.320 --> 46:25.490
Come on. We don't want to be
caught out here after nightfall.

46:39.110 --> 46:42.200
Ah, blimey! Looks like the old girl
has got the kettle on.

46:42.310 --> 46:43.970
Nice cup o' Rosy Lee.

46:44.080 --> 46:46.740
- It's lovely.
- It's merely a trifle.

46:46.850 --> 46:49.140
Still plenty to do.
Ain't quite finished it yet.

46:49.250 --> 46:51.150
It'll look the business
when it is, though.

46:52.750 --> 46:56.050
Beaver, is that you?
I've been worried sick!

46:56.160 --> 46:58.850
If I find you've been
out with Badger again, I...

46:59.760 --> 47:00.990
Oh!

47:01.090 --> 47:03.360
Well, those aren't badgers.

47:03.460 --> 47:08.088
Oh, I never thought
I'd live to see this day.

47:08.998 --> 47:12.398
Look at my fur. You couldn't
give me ten minutes warning?

47:12.508 --> 47:15.028
I'd have given a week
if I thought it would've helped.

47:15.138 --> 47:17.108
Oh, come inside,

47:17.208 --> 47:19.368
and we'll see if we
can't get you some food,

47:19.478 --> 47:23.878
and some civilized company.

47:23.978 --> 47:26.248
Now, careful. Watch your step.

47:26.348 --> 47:27.908
Excuse the mess.

47:28.018 --> 47:31.048
Can't get Mr. Beaver
to get out of his chair.

47:35.298 --> 47:37.858
Enjoyin' the scenery, are we?

47:41.668 --> 47:44.358
Isn't there anything
we can do to help Tumnus?

47:44.468 --> 47:47.528
They'll have taken him to the Witch's.
You know what they say.

47:47.638 --> 47:51.466
There's few that go through
them gates that come out again.

47:51.576 --> 47:54.046
Fish 'n' chips?

47:54.676 --> 47:58.276
But there is hope, dear.
Lots of hope.

47:58.376 --> 48:01.746
Oh, yeah,
there's a right bit more than hope!

48:02.716 --> 48:05.586
Aslan is on the move.

48:12.626 --> 48:13.856
Who's Aslan?

48:13.966 --> 48:16.826
Who's Aslan?

48:16.936 --> 48:19.906
You cheeky little blighter.

48:21.636 --> 48:22.896
What?

48:25.476 --> 48:28.906
- You don't know, do you?
- We haven't exactly been here long.

48:29.016 --> 48:31.376
Well, he's only the king
of the whole wood.

48:31.476 --> 48:35.004
The top geezer.
The real King of Narnia.

48:35.114 --> 48:39.014
- He's been away for a long while.
- But he's just got back!

48:39.124 --> 48:41.884
And he's waitin' for you
near the Stone Table!

48:41.994 --> 48:45.014
- He's waiting for us?
- You're bloomin' joking!

48:45.124 --> 48:47.684
They don't even know about the prophecy!

48:47.794 --> 48:51.594
- Well, then...
- Look.

48:51.694 --> 48:53.864
Aslan's return,

48:53.964 --> 48:57.234
Tumnus' arrest, the secret police,

48:57.334 --> 48:59.434
it's all happening because of you!

48:59.544 --> 49:02.904
- You're blaming us?
- No! Not blaming.

49:03.014 --> 49:06.844
- Thanking you.
- There's a prophecy.

49:06.944 --> 49:09.814
"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone

49:09.914 --> 49:12.944
sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

49:13.054 --> 49:15.684
the evil time will be over and done."

49:15.794 --> 49:18.084
- That doesn't really rhyme.
- I know it don't.

49:18.194 --> 49:20.452
You're kinda missin' the point!

49:20.562 --> 49:22.962
It has long been foretold

49:23.062 --> 49:25.762
that two Sons of Adam
and two Daughters of Eve

49:25.862 --> 49:31.102
will defeat the White Witch
and restore peace to Narnia.

49:33.502 --> 49:34.992
And you think we're the ones?

49:35.102 --> 49:38.102
You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's
already fitted out your army.

49:38.212 --> 49:40.142
- Our army?
- Mum sent us away

49:40.242 --> 49:43.082
so we wouldn't get
caught up in a war.

49:43.882 --> 49:46.642
I think you've made a mistake.

49:46.752 --> 49:49.622
- We're not heroes.
- We're from Finchley.

49:50.692 --> 49:51.782
Hmm.

49:51.892 --> 49:54.952
Thank you for your hospitality.

49:55.962 --> 49:59.552
- But we really have to go.
- No, you can't just leave!

49:59.662 --> 50:03.292
He's right.
We have to help Mr. Tumnus.

50:03.402 --> 50:05.890
It's out of our hands.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.400
I'm sorry,

50:07.500 --> 50:10.700
but it's time the four of us
were getting home. Ed?

50:13.280 --> 50:14.940
Ed?

50:17.010 --> 50:20.350
- I'm gonna kill him.
- You may not have to.

50:20.450 --> 50:23.440
Has Edmund ever been to Narnia before?

50:50.248 --> 50:51.508
Hurry!

51:11.928 --> 51:14.528
- Edmund!
- Shh! They'll hear you!

51:15.738 --> 51:16.858
No!

51:16.968 --> 51:19.368
- Get off!
- You're playing into her hands.

51:19.478 --> 51:21.878
- We can't just let him go!
- He's our brother!

51:21.978 --> 51:24.998
He's the bait!
The Witch wants all four of you!

51:25.108 --> 51:28.978
- Why?
- To stop the prophecy from coming true.

51:29.088 --> 51:30.448
To kill you!

51:40.456 --> 51:43.686
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

51:43.796 --> 51:46.826
None of this would have happened
if you had listened to me!

51:46.936 --> 51:49.126
- You knew this would happen.
- I didn't know.

51:49.236 --> 51:51.826
Which is why we should
have left while we could!

51:51.936 --> 51:52.926
Stop it!

51:54.106 --> 51:57.836
- This isn't going to help Edmund.
- She's right.

51:57.946 --> 52:01.076
Only Aslan can help your brother now.

52:02.786 --> 52:04.376
Then take us to him.

53:14.512 --> 53:17.512
Be still, stranger,
or you'll never move again.

53:18.082 --> 53:19.712
- Who are you?
- I'm Edmund!

53:19.822 --> 53:23.412
I met the Queen in the woods!
She told me to come back here!

53:23.522 --> 53:24.962
I'm a Son of Adam!

53:25.062 --> 53:30.052
Hmm. My apologies,
fortunate favorite of the queen.

53:30.162 --> 53:33.462
Or else, not so fortunate.

53:37.772 --> 53:39.572
Right this way.

54:00.730 --> 54:02.490
Wait here.

54:41.798 --> 54:42.928
Like it?

54:43.038 --> 54:47.938
Uh... Yes, Your Majesty.

54:50.408 --> 54:52.498
I thought you might.

54:54.578 --> 54:56.278
Tell me, Edmund...

54:59.048 --> 55:01.078
Are your sisters deaf?

55:01.188 --> 55:02.848
No.

55:02.958 --> 55:05.788
And your brother, is he...

55:07.688 --> 55:09.588
...unintelligent?

55:09.698 --> 55:12.098
Well, I think so.
But Mum says...

55:12.198 --> 55:16.288
Then how dare you come alone?!

55:16.398 --> 55:19.098
- I tried!
- Edmund, I asked so little of you.

55:19.206 --> 55:22.066
- They just don't listen to me!
- You couldn't even do that.

55:22.166 --> 55:23.636
I did bring them halfway.

55:23.736 --> 55:26.406
They're at the little house at the dam
with the Beavers.

55:33.616 --> 55:35.516
Well.

55:35.616 --> 55:39.516
I suppose you're not
a total loss then, are you?

55:42.286 --> 55:44.186
Well, I was wondering,

55:45.196 --> 55:50.226
could I maybe have some more
Turkish delight now?

55:55.776 --> 55:57.826
Our guest is hungry.

56:04.514 --> 56:07.974
This way for your num-nums.

56:10.114 --> 56:13.054
Maugrim?

56:15.024 --> 56:17.114
You know what to do.

56:43.314 --> 56:44.284
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

56:45.954 --> 56:48.884
- Oh, right then.
- What's she doing?

56:49.622 --> 56:51.312
Oh, you'll be thanking me later.

56:51.422 --> 56:54.792
It's a long journey and Beaver
gets pretty cranky when he's hungry.

56:54.892 --> 56:56.382
I'm cranky now!

56:58.632 --> 56:59.892
Take them.

57:03.432 --> 57:06.892
- Do you think we'll need jam?
- Only if the Witch serves toast.

57:22.152 --> 57:23.142
Hurry.

57:38.770 --> 57:42.070
Badger and me dug this.
Comes out right near his place.

57:42.170 --> 57:44.400
You told me
it led to your mum's!

57:45.110 --> 57:46.470
Lucy!

57:48.110 --> 57:49.580
They're in the tunnel.

57:49.680 --> 57:52.670
- Quick! This way.
- Hurry!

57:53.920 --> 57:56.080
- Run!
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

58:04.430 --> 58:06.360
You should have brought a map!

58:06.460 --> 58:09.160
There wasn't room next to the jam.

58:16.040 --> 58:18.470
Come on, Lucy!

58:37.858 --> 58:41.158
I'm so sorry, dear.

58:41.258 --> 58:43.488
He was my best mate.

58:52.778 --> 58:53.998
What happened here?

58:54.108 --> 58:56.908
This is what becomes
of those who cross the Witch.

58:57.008 --> 59:00.738
You take one more step, traitor,
and I'll chew you to splinters!

59:00.848 --> 59:03.678
Relax. I'm one of the good guys.

59:03.788 --> 59:07.806
Yeah? Well, you look an awful lot
like one of the bad ones.

59:07.916 --> 59:10.216
An unfortunate family resemblance.

59:10.326 --> 59:13.516
But we can argue breeding later.
Right now we've got to move.

59:15.026 --> 59:17.016
What did you have in mind?

59:24.606 --> 59:26.226
Greetings, gents.

59:27.036 --> 59:30.376
- Lost something, have we?
- Don't patronize me!

59:30.476 --> 59:33.136
I know where your allegiance lies.

59:33.246 --> 59:36.406
We're looking for some humans.

59:36.516 --> 59:38.816
Humans? Here in Narnia?

59:38.916 --> 59:41.686
That's a valuable bit of information,
don't you think?

59:43.626 --> 59:45.916
Your reward is your life.

59:46.026 --> 59:48.456
It's not much,

59:49.256 --> 59:50.694
but still.

59:51.364 --> 59:53.384
Where are the fugitives?

01:00:00.374 --> 01:00:03.344
North. They ran north.

01:00:04.274 --> 01:00:06.244
Smell them out.

01:00:16.554 --> 01:00:20.454
They were helping Tumnus.
The Witch got here before I did.

01:00:20.554 --> 01:00:23.154
Ow! Oh!

01:00:23.264 --> 01:00:24.654
Are you all right?

01:00:24.764 --> 01:00:27.894
Well, I wish I could say their bark
was worse than their bite. Ow!

01:00:27.994 --> 01:00:32.404
Stop squirming!
You're worse than Beaver on bath day.

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:33.974
Worst day of the year.

01:00:34.074 --> 01:00:36.562
Thank you for your kindness,

01:00:36.672 --> 01:00:38.762
but that's all the cure I have time for.

01:00:38.872 --> 01:00:39.842
You're leaving?

01:00:39.942 --> 01:00:43.502
It has been a pleasure, My Queen,
and an honor, but time is short

01:00:43.612 --> 01:00:46.742
and Aslan himself has asked me
to gather more troops.

01:00:46.852 --> 01:00:50.652
- You've seen Aslan?
- What's he like?

01:00:50.752 --> 01:00:53.812
Like everything we've ever heard.

01:00:53.922 --> 01:00:57.412
You'll be glad to have him by your side
in the battle against the Witch.

01:00:57.522 --> 01:01:00.292
But we're not planning
on fighting any witch.

01:01:00.392 --> 01:01:03.162
But surely, King Peter, the prophecy!

01:01:03.262 --> 01:01:05.392
We can't go to war without you.

01:01:10.942 --> 01:01:13.202
We just want our brother back.

01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:39.660
If...

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:44.140
If you're not going to eat that...

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.600
I'd get up, but...

01:01:52.710 --> 01:01:54.940
...but my legs.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:07.288
Mr. Tumnus.

01:02:08.858 --> 01:02:10.798
What's left of him.

01:02:17.298 --> 01:02:21.138
- You're Lucy Pevensie's brother.
- I'm Edmund.

01:02:22.308 --> 01:02:25.538
Yes. Yes, you have the same nose.

01:02:30.048 --> 01:02:31.778
Is your sister all right?

01:02:34.388 --> 01:02:35.908
Is she safe?

01:02:39.828 --> 01:02:41.848
I don't know.

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:52.526
My police tore that dam apart.

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:56.996
Your little family
are nowhere to be found.

01:03:01.076 --> 01:03:03.946
- Where did they go?
- I don't know!

01:03:04.716 --> 01:03:07.306
Then you're of no further use to me.

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:11.746
Wait! The beaver
said something about Aslan!

01:03:16.196 --> 01:03:17.656
Aslan?

01:03:19.026 --> 01:03:20.016
Where?

01:03:22.696 --> 01:03:25.426
- I...
- He's a stranger here, Your Majesty.

01:03:25.536 --> 01:03:27.466
He can't be expected
to know anything.

01:03:29.436 --> 01:03:33.276
I said... where is Aslan?

01:03:37.674 --> 01:03:39.804
I... I don't know.

01:03:39.914 --> 01:03:42.274
I left before they said anything.

01:03:44.784 --> 01:03:47.114
I wanted to see you!

01:03:49.454 --> 01:03:51.214
Guard!

01:03:51.854 --> 01:03:53.624
Your Majesty.

01:03:55.864 --> 01:03:58.664
Release the faun.

01:03:59.464 --> 01:04:01.954
Ah! Ah!

01:04:11.244 --> 01:04:13.234
Do you know why you're here, faun?

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:19.812
Because I believe in a free Narnia.

01:04:20.852 --> 01:04:23.112
You're here...

01:04:23.222 --> 01:04:26.682
...because he turned you in.

01:04:28.492 --> 01:04:29.962
For sweeties.

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.662
Take him upstairs.

01:04:45.412 --> 01:04:48.042
And ready my sleigh.

01:04:48.142 --> 01:04:50.772
Edmund misses his family.

01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.690
Now, Aslan's camp
is near the Stone Table

01:05:16.810 --> 01:05:20.330
- just across the frozen river.
- River?

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:24.400
The river's been frozen solid
for a hundred years.

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:30.950
- It's so far.
- It's the world, dear.

01:05:31.050 --> 01:05:32.880
Did you expect it to be small?

01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:36.090
Smaller.

01:05:52.908 --> 01:05:55.898
When you're ready, Son of Adam.

01:06:03.548 --> 01:06:05.988
Yah! Yah! Yah!

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:34.976
Come on, humans!
While we're still young.

01:06:35.716 --> 01:06:38.476
If he tells us to hurry one more time,

01:06:38.586 --> 01:06:42.346
I'm gonna turn him
into a big, fluffy hat.

01:06:42.456 --> 01:06:44.756
Hurry up! Come on!

01:06:44.856 --> 01:06:48.556
- He is getting a little bossy.
- Behind you! It's her!

01:06:48.656 --> 01:06:50.526
- Run! Run!
- Run!

01:07:15.756 --> 01:07:17.016
Hurry!

01:07:19.854 --> 01:07:21.484
Inside!

01:07:21.594 --> 01:07:23.424
Dive! Dive!

01:07:25.924 --> 01:07:28.054
Quick! Quick, quick, quick!

01:07:56.354 --> 01:07:58.794
Maybe she's gone.

01:07:59.724 --> 01:08:02.194
- I suppose I'll go look.
- No!

01:08:02.294 --> 01:08:04.854
You're worth nothing to Narnia dead.

01:08:04.962 --> 01:08:06.932
Well, neither are you, Beaver.

01:08:07.032 --> 01:08:09.192
Thanks, sweetheart.

01:08:17.612 --> 01:08:21.202
- What's that? What's...
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:08:24.221 --> 01:08:25.952
Come out! Come out!

01:08:26.051 --> 01:08:29.212
I hope you've all been good
'cause there's someone here to see you!

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.939
Merry Christmas, sir.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:57.040
It certainly is, Lucy,
since you have arrived.

01:08:57.149 --> 01:09:01.180
Look, I've put up with a lot
since I got here, but this...

01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:04.720
- We thought you were the Witch.
- Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that,

01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:10.279
but in my defense, I have been driving
one of these longer than the Witch.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:13.490
I thought there was
no Christmas in Narnia.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:16.120
No. For a long time.

01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:20.529
But the hope that you have brought,
Your Majesties,

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.470
is finally starting
to weaken the Witch's power.

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.770
Still, I dare say
you could do with these.

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:33.609
Presents!

01:09:40.158 --> 01:09:42.457
The juice of the fire-flower.

01:09:42.558 --> 01:09:46.658
One drop will cure any injury.

01:09:48.228 --> 01:09:50.787
And though I hope
you never have to use it...

01:09:53.908 --> 01:09:55.768
Thank you, sir,

01:09:55.868 --> 01:09:59.278
but I think I could be brave enough.

01:09:59.378 --> 01:10:02.038
I'm sure you could.

01:10:02.148 --> 01:10:05.578
But battles are ugly affairs.

01:10:12.218 --> 01:10:13.988
Susan.

01:10:16.458 --> 01:10:21.256
Trust in this bow
and it will not easily miss.

01:10:22.426 --> 01:10:24.986
What happened
to "battles are ugly affairs"?

01:10:27.306 --> 01:10:30.466
Though you don't seem to have
a problem making yourself heard,

01:10:30.576 --> 01:10:34.406
blow on this
and wherever you are,

01:10:34.506 --> 01:10:36.706
help will come.

01:10:37.816 --> 01:10:39.606
Thanks.

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:42.276
Peter.

01:10:43.516 --> 01:10:47.356
The time to use these
may be near at hand.

01:10:55.066 --> 01:10:56.226
Thank you, sir.

01:10:57.036 --> 01:11:00.836
These are tools, not toys.

01:11:00.936 --> 01:11:03.126
Bear them well and wisely.

01:11:04.876 --> 01:11:07.534
Now, I must be off.

01:11:07.644 --> 01:11:10.164
Winter is almost over,

01:11:10.274 --> 01:11:14.684
and things do pile up
when you've been gone a hundred years.

01:11:18.084 --> 01:11:20.214
Long live Aslan!

01:11:22.654 --> 01:11:24.644
And Merry Christmas!

01:11:27.124 --> 01:11:29.684
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

01:11:29.794 --> 01:11:33.094
- See you next year!
- Goodbye!

01:11:33.194 --> 01:11:35.224
Told you he was real.

01:11:35.634 --> 01:11:40.404
He said winter was almost over.

01:11:40.504 --> 01:11:42.534
You know what that means.

01:11:44.174 --> 01:11:46.544
No more ice.

01:11:56.722 --> 01:11:59.982
- We need to cross, now!
- Don't beavers make dams?

01:12:00.092 --> 01:12:02.282
- I'm not that fast, dear.
- Come on!

01:12:02.392 --> 01:12:04.622
Wait! Will you think
about this for a minute?

01:12:04.732 --> 01:12:07.492
- We don't have a minute.
- I'm just trying to be realistic.

01:12:07.602 --> 01:12:11.052
No, you're trying to be smart.
As usual.

01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:48.030
Wait. Maybe I should go first.

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:50.900
Maybe you should.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:59.810
You've been sneaking
second helpings, haven't you?

01:12:59.910 --> 01:13:02.410
Well, you never know
which meal's gonna be your last.

01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:05.820
Especially with your cooking.

01:13:24.368 --> 01:13:26.308
If Mum knew what we were doing...

01:13:26.408 --> 01:13:27.768
Mum's not here.

01:13:29.808 --> 01:13:31.938
Oh, no!

01:13:32.048 --> 01:13:33.408
Run!

01:13:36.848 --> 01:13:38.278
Hurry!

01:13:48.528 --> 01:13:49.958
No!

01:13:50.098 --> 01:13:51.288
Peter!

01:13:51.998 --> 01:13:53.828
Put that down, boy.

01:13:54.538 --> 01:13:57.768
- Someone could get hurt.
- Don't worry about me!

01:13:57.868 --> 01:13:59.198
Run him through!

01:13:59.308 --> 01:14:02.968
Leave now while you can,
and your brother leaves with you.

01:14:03.078 --> 01:14:06.006
Stop, Peter!
Maybe we should listen to him!

01:14:06.106 --> 01:14:07.736
Smart girl.

01:14:07.846 --> 01:14:11.076
Don't listen to him!
Kill him! Kill him now!

01:14:11.186 --> 01:14:14.446
Oh, come on. This isn't your war.

01:14:14.556 --> 01:14:17.986
All my Queen wants is for you
to take your family and go.

01:14:18.126 --> 01:14:20.886
Look, just because some man
in a red coat hands you a sword,

01:14:20.996 --> 01:14:24.486
it doesn't make you a hero!
Just drop it!

01:14:24.626 --> 01:14:27.186
No, Peter!
Narnia needs you!

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:29.566
Gut him while you still have a chance!

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:33.726
What's it gonna be, Son of Adam?
I won't wait forever.

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:35.536
And neither will the river.

01:14:37.476 --> 01:14:38.666
Peter!

01:14:46.486 --> 01:14:47.816
Hold onto me!

01:15:47.812 --> 01:15:50.242
Lovely.

01:15:58.652 --> 01:16:00.642
What have you done?

01:16:03.122 --> 01:16:05.112
Lucy!

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:08.422
Lucy!

01:16:12.762 --> 01:16:14.892
Has anyone seen my coat?

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:23.440
Don't you worry, dear.

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:26.770
Your brother's got you
well looked after.

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:30.580
And I don't think you'll be
needing those coats anymore.

01:17:05.548 --> 01:17:09.038
It's so warm out.

01:17:12.188 --> 01:17:15.058
I'll go and check the sleigh.

01:17:16.888 --> 01:17:18.488
Your Majesty.

01:17:18.598 --> 01:17:20.288
We found the traitor.

01:17:20.398 --> 01:17:22.698
He was rallying your enemies
near the Shuddering Woods.

01:17:23.898 --> 01:17:26.128
Ah. Nice of you to drop in.

01:17:26.238 --> 01:17:28.668
You were so helpful
to my wolves last night.

01:17:29.138 --> 01:17:31.608
Perhaps you can help me now.

01:17:31.738 --> 01:17:35.578
- Forgive me, Your Majesty.
- Oh, don't waste time with flattery.

01:17:35.678 --> 01:17:40.138
Not to seem rude,
but I wasn't actually talking to you.

01:17:48.788 --> 01:17:51.226
Where are the humans headed?

01:17:55.226 --> 01:17:59.636
Wait! No! Don't. The beaver said
something about the Stone Table,

01:17:59.766 --> 01:18:01.566
and that Aslan had an army there.

01:18:03.466 --> 01:18:05.636
An army?

01:18:10.746 --> 01:18:12.766
Thank you, Edmund.

01:18:12.916 --> 01:18:16.346
I'm glad this creature
got to see some honesty...

01:18:17.716 --> 01:18:20.686
...before he dies.
- No!

01:18:31.196 --> 01:18:34.396
Think about whose side you're on,
Edmund.

01:18:34.506 --> 01:18:36.624
Mine...

01:18:38.634 --> 01:18:40.464
...or theirs.

01:18:45.974 --> 01:18:49.374
Go on ahead.
Gather the faithful.

01:18:49.784 --> 01:18:52.714
If it's a war Aslan wants...

01:18:54.484 --> 01:18:56.714
...it's a war he shall get.

01:19:57.982 --> 01:20:00.612
Why are they all staring at us?

01:20:00.722 --> 01:20:03.122
Maybe they think you look funny.

01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:11.890
Oi, stop your fussing.
You look lovely.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:32.400
We have come to see Aslan.

01:21:16.118 --> 01:21:19.518
Welcome, Peter, Son of Adam.

01:21:19.658 --> 01:21:23.528
Welcome, Susan and Lucy,
Daughters of Eve.

01:21:23.628 --> 01:21:27.158
And welcome to you, Beavers.
You have my thanks.

01:21:27.298 --> 01:21:30.238
But where is the fourth?

01:21:30.938 --> 01:21:33.868
That's why we're here, sir.

01:21:33.978 --> 01:21:35.408
We need your help.

01:21:35.508 --> 01:21:38.566
We had a little trouble along the way.

01:21:38.706 --> 01:21:41.006
Our brother's been captured
by the White Witch.

01:21:41.116 --> 01:21:43.946
Captured? How could this happen?

01:21:45.516 --> 01:21:49.916
He betrayed them, Your Majesty.

01:21:50.016 --> 01:21:53.786
- Then he has betrayed us all!
- Peace, Oreius.

01:21:53.896 --> 01:21:55.826
I'm sure there's an explanation.

01:21:58.826 --> 01:22:01.056
It's my fault, really.

01:22:02.436 --> 01:22:05.056
I was too hard on him.

01:22:08.576 --> 01:22:09.936
We all were.

01:22:10.906 --> 01:22:12.706
Sir, he's our brother.

01:22:12.806 --> 01:22:14.746
I know, dear one.

01:22:14.876 --> 01:22:18.606
But that only makes
the betrayal all the worse.

01:22:18.716 --> 01:22:21.744
This may be harder than you think.

01:22:28.654 --> 01:22:33.564
That is Cair Paravel,
the castle of the four thrones.

01:22:34.534 --> 01:22:38.864
In one of which you will sit, Peter,
as High King.

01:22:39.504 --> 01:22:41.904
You doubt the prophecy?

01:22:42.004 --> 01:22:45.404
No. That's just it.

01:22:46.904 --> 01:22:49.844
Aslan, I'm not what you all think I am.

01:22:49.944 --> 01:22:52.274
Peter Pevensie, formerly of Finchley.

01:22:53.544 --> 01:22:58.504
Beaver also mentioned that you
planned on turning him into a hat.

01:23:01.094 --> 01:23:04.544
Peter, there is a Deep Magic,

01:23:04.694 --> 01:23:06.322
more powerful than any of us,

01:23:06.422 --> 01:23:08.622
that rules over all of Narnia.

01:23:08.732 --> 01:23:11.222
It defines right from wrong,

01:23:11.362 --> 01:23:14.022
and governs all our destinies.

01:23:14.132 --> 01:23:17.122
Yours... and mine.

01:23:17.572 --> 01:23:19.662
But I couldn't even
protect my own family.

01:23:19.802 --> 01:23:22.272
You've brought them safely this far.

01:23:22.642 --> 01:23:24.472
Not all of them.

01:23:24.582 --> 01:23:28.882
Peter, I will do what I can
to help your brother,

01:23:28.982 --> 01:23:32.012
but I need you to consider
what I ask of you.

01:23:34.052 --> 01:23:36.492
I, too, want my family safe.

01:23:39.622 --> 01:23:43.622
Is our little prince uncomfortable?

01:23:43.762 --> 01:23:47.132
Does he want his pillow fluffed?

01:23:49.002 --> 01:23:53.490
Special treatment for the special boy!

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:57.170
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:01.740
You look like Mum.

01:24:01.850 --> 01:24:04.750
Mum hasn't had a dress like this
since before the war.

01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:10.050
We should bring her one back.
A whole trunk full!

01:24:11.320 --> 01:24:13.050
If we ever get back.

01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:19.660
I'm sorry I'm like that.

01:24:20.930 --> 01:24:24.370
We used to have fun together, didn't we?

01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:28.770
Yes. Before you got boring.

01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:30.270
Oh, really?

01:24:43.888 --> 01:24:45.288
Please don't try to run.

01:24:45.388 --> 01:24:49.218
- We're tired.
- And we prefer to kill you quickly.

01:24:53.128 --> 01:24:54.828
Susan!

01:25:05.108 --> 01:25:06.438
Get back!

01:25:07.478 --> 01:25:09.338
Peter! Ah!

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:12.508
Come on.

01:25:13.518 --> 01:25:16.448
We've already been through this before.

01:25:16.548 --> 01:25:19.048
We both know you haven't got it in you.

01:25:19.188 --> 01:25:20.916
Peter! Watch out!

01:25:29.996 --> 01:25:34.656
No! Stay your weapons.
This is Peter's battle.

01:25:36.206 --> 01:25:38.266
You may think you're a king,

01:25:38.406 --> 01:25:40.666
but you're going to die...

01:25:40.776 --> 01:25:42.966
...like a dog!
- Look out!

01:25:43.746 --> 01:25:45.336
Peter!

01:26:01.066 --> 01:26:03.996
After him.

01:26:05.366 --> 01:26:07.454
He'll lead you to Edmund.

01:26:11.734 --> 01:26:13.204
Peter.

01:26:14.004 --> 01:26:15.494
Clean your sword.

01:26:20.214 --> 01:26:24.804
Rise, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane,

01:26:24.954 --> 01:26:27.714
Knight of Narnia.

01:26:53.812 --> 01:26:55.472
The minotaurs will take the left flanks.

01:26:55.582 --> 01:26:58.742
We'll keep the giants in reserve
and send the dwarfs in first.

01:27:05.022 --> 01:27:06.652
Ah!

01:27:07.822 --> 01:27:09.622
The prisoner!

01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:40.440
You're not
going to kill me?

01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:45.560
Not yet.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.090
We have work to do.

01:28:22.128 --> 01:28:24.028
Edmund!

01:28:55.998 --> 01:28:58.228
What's done is done.

01:28:58.328 --> 01:29:02.358
There is no need to speak to Edmund
about what is past.

01:29:11.276 --> 01:29:12.866
Hello.

01:29:26.926 --> 01:29:29.986
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

01:29:30.126 --> 01:29:32.386
Get some sleep.

01:29:40.406 --> 01:29:42.426
And Edmund...

01:29:44.676 --> 01:29:46.236
...try not to wander off.

01:29:59.684 --> 01:30:02.054
Narnia's not going
to run out of toast, Ed.

01:30:03.854 --> 01:30:07.194
I'm sure they'll pack something up
for the journey back.

01:30:07.294 --> 01:30:08.624
We're going home?

01:30:09.594 --> 01:30:11.654
You are.

01:30:12.434 --> 01:30:14.864
I promised Mum I'd keep you three safe.

01:30:15.804 --> 01:30:18.234
But it doesn't mean
I can't stay behind and help.

01:30:18.374 --> 01:30:20.744
But they need us.

01:30:21.914 --> 01:30:24.104
All four of us.

01:30:24.214 --> 01:30:26.074
Lucy, it's too dangerous.

01:30:26.184 --> 01:30:28.674
You almost drowned!
Edmund was almost killed!

01:30:29.484 --> 01:30:32.314
Which is why we have to stay.

01:30:34.054 --> 01:30:38.782
I've seen what the White Witch can do.
And I've helped her do it.

01:30:40.222 --> 01:30:43.992
And we can't leave these
people behind to suffer for it.

01:30:51.202 --> 01:30:53.672
I suppose that's it then.

01:30:55.072 --> 01:30:56.562
Where are you going?

01:30:58.442 --> 01:31:00.842
To get in some practice.

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:26.890
Come on, Ed! Sword point up,
like Oreius showed us.

01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:29.370
- En garde!
- Now block.

01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:34.100
- Hey!
- Peter! Edmund!

01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:37.010
Whoa, horsie!

01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:39.580
- My name is Philip.
- Oh.

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.480
Sorry.

01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:44.110
The Witch has demanded
a meeting with Aslan.

01:31:45.520 --> 01:31:47.820
She's on her way here.

01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:50.530
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

01:31:51.730 --> 01:31:55.960
- Go away, Witch!
- Empress of the Lone Islands!

01:31:56.700 --> 01:31:59.640
You don't belong here!
Go away!

01:32:23.488 --> 01:32:26.018
You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

01:32:29.468 --> 01:32:32.328
His offense was not against you.

01:32:32.898 --> 01:32:36.128
Have you forgotten the laws
upon which Narnia was built?

01:32:36.238 --> 01:32:39.678
Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

01:32:39.808 --> 01:32:42.838
I was there when it was written.

01:32:43.708 --> 01:32:48.848
Then you'll remember well
that every traitor belongs to me.

01:32:49.348 --> 01:32:52.216
His blood is my property.

01:32:52.316 --> 01:32:54.586
Try and take him then.

01:32:57.356 --> 01:33:02.026
Do you really think that mere force
will deny me my right...

01:33:02.696 --> 01:33:04.426
...little King?

01:33:06.996 --> 01:33:10.736
Aslan knows that unless I have blood,
as the law demands,

01:33:10.836 --> 01:33:14.236
all of Narnia will be overturned

01:33:14.336 --> 01:33:17.276
and perish in fire and water.

01:33:17.406 --> 01:33:20.606
That boy will die

01:33:20.716 --> 01:33:24.236
on the Stone Table...

01:33:26.216 --> 01:33:28.316
...as is tradition.

01:33:30.756 --> 01:33:33.196
You dare not refuse me.

01:33:33.726 --> 01:33:35.096
Enough.

01:33:38.194 --> 01:33:40.394
I shall talk with you alone.

01:34:33.782 --> 01:34:36.582
She has renounced her claim
on the Son of Adam's blood.

01:34:38.692 --> 01:34:41.482
How do I know your promise will be kept?

01:35:34.510 --> 01:35:37.640
- Susan!
- Mm?

01:36:27.088 --> 01:36:29.888
Shouldn't you both be in bed?

01:36:32.428 --> 01:36:34.728
We couldn't sleep.

01:36:35.838 --> 01:36:38.096
Please, Aslan.

01:36:38.666 --> 01:36:40.326
Couldn't we come with you?

01:36:40.436 --> 01:36:43.496
I would be glad of the company
for a while.

01:36:45.246 --> 01:36:47.036
Thank you.

01:37:11.036 --> 01:37:12.726
It is time.

01:37:12.836 --> 01:37:16.236
From here, I must go on alone.

01:37:16.336 --> 01:37:17.736
But Aslan...

01:37:17.836 --> 01:37:21.296
You have to trust me.
For this must be done.

01:37:21.944 --> 01:37:23.674
Thank you, Susan.

01:37:23.774 --> 01:37:26.174
Thank you, Lucy.

01:37:26.284 --> 01:37:28.274
And farewell.

01:38:33.912 --> 01:38:37.542
Behold. The great lion.

01:39:03.610 --> 01:39:05.200
Do you want some milk?

01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.400
Why doesn't he fight back?

01:39:10.180 --> 01:39:12.310
Bind him!

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:15.850
Tie him up! Get him!

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:22.180
Wait!

01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:26.300
Let him first be shaved.

01:39:48.318 --> 01:39:49.808
Bring him to me.

01:40:50.976 --> 01:40:53.676
You know, Aslan,

01:40:53.776 --> 01:40:56.006
I'm a little disappointed in you.

01:40:57.916 --> 01:41:01.976
Did you honestly think by all this
that you could save the human traitor?

01:41:05.156 --> 01:41:07.984
You are giving me your life

01:41:08.094 --> 01:41:10.024
and saving no one.

01:41:12.964 --> 01:41:14.864
So much for love.

01:41:23.774 --> 01:41:25.904
Tonight...

01:41:26.644 --> 01:41:31.174
...the Deep Magic will be appeased!

01:41:34.784 --> 01:41:37.414
But tomorrow,

01:41:38.894 --> 01:41:42.844
we will take Narnia

01:41:42.994 --> 01:41:47.294
forever!

01:41:52.202 --> 01:41:54.292
In that knowledge,

01:41:54.432 --> 01:41:57.302
despair...

01:42:06.182 --> 01:42:08.912
...and die!

01:42:27.502 --> 01:42:29.402
The Great Cat...

01:42:29.502 --> 01:42:32.162
...is dead!

01:42:35.882 --> 01:42:37.870
General.

01:42:38.010 --> 01:42:40.950
Prepare your troops for battle.

01:42:44.050 --> 01:42:46.450
However short it may be.

01:43:34.128 --> 01:43:36.728
It's too late.

01:43:36.868 --> 01:43:39.168
He's gone.

01:43:59.058 --> 01:44:01.748
He must have known what he was doing.

01:44:34.926 --> 01:44:38.456
Get away! Get away, all of you!

01:44:38.596 --> 01:44:41.586
No. Look.

01:45:02.484 --> 01:45:05.074
We have to tell the others.

01:45:05.654 --> 01:45:09.244
- We can't just leave him!
- Lucy, there's no time.

01:45:09.394 --> 01:45:11.624
They need to know.

01:45:17.894 --> 01:45:19.894
The trees.

01:46:04.142 --> 01:46:06.072
Be still, my Princes.

01:46:07.912 --> 01:46:11.182
I bring grave news from your sisters.

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.160
She's right.

01:46:31.370 --> 01:46:33.200
He's gone.

01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:40.800
Then you'll have to lead us.

01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:48.210
Peter, there's an army out there
and it's ready to follow you.

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:51.810
- I can't.
- Aslan believed you could.

01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:56.760
And so do I.

01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:08.398
The Witch's army is nearing, sire.
What are your orders?

01:47:54.016 --> 01:47:57.606
They come, Your Highness, in numbers
and weapons far greater than our own.

01:47:57.716 --> 01:47:59.846
Numbers do not win a battle.

01:47:59.956 --> 01:48:03.756
No. But I bet they help.

01:49:33.812 --> 01:49:36.302
I have no interest in prisoners.

01:49:36.412 --> 01:49:38.212
Kill them all.

01:49:38.312 --> 01:49:42.372
Ahh!

01:50:26.590 --> 01:50:29.220
Go on!

01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:38.160
Look to the sky!

01:51:05.098 --> 01:51:06.998
Are you with me?

01:51:08.228 --> 01:51:09.568
To the death.

01:51:12.738 --> 01:51:17.328
For Narnia and for Aslan!

01:51:21.448 --> 01:51:23.678
Go!

01:51:23.778 --> 01:51:26.478
Go! For Aslan!

01:52:58.674 --> 01:53:00.834
We should go.

01:53:06.184 --> 01:53:08.272
I'm so cold.

01:53:28.762 --> 01:53:30.762
Ah!

01:53:34.242 --> 01:53:36.032
Susan!

01:53:52.222 --> 01:53:54.250
Where's Aslan?

01:53:55.730 --> 01:53:57.590
What have they done?

01:54:07.740 --> 01:54:09.260
Aslan!

01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:19.880
But we saw the knife. The Witch.

01:54:19.980 --> 01:54:23.470
If the Witch knew
the true meaning of sacrifice,

01:54:23.590 --> 01:54:26.890
she might have interpreted
the Deep Magic differently.

01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:29.580
That when a willing victim
who has committed no treachery

01:54:29.690 --> 01:54:31.890
is killed in a traitor's stead,

01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:35.230
the Stone Table will crack

01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:38.958
and even death itself
will turn backwards.

01:54:39.068 --> 01:54:41.558
We sent the news that you were dead.

01:54:41.668 --> 01:54:43.828
Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.

01:54:43.938 --> 01:54:45.298
We have to help them.

01:54:45.408 --> 01:54:49.168
We will, dear one, but not alone.

01:54:49.608 --> 01:54:51.268
Climb on my back.

01:54:51.378 --> 01:54:54.078
We have far to go
and little time to get there.

01:54:54.178 --> 01:54:56.878
And you may want to cover your ears.

01:55:17.808 --> 01:55:19.778
Fire!

01:55:39.456 --> 01:55:41.256
Yes!

01:55:53.536 --> 01:55:56.436
Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!

01:55:56.546 --> 01:56:00.346
That's the signal. Come on!

01:56:08.184 --> 01:56:09.584
Where are we going?

01:56:19.864 --> 01:56:21.424
Hang on!

01:56:22.704 --> 01:56:24.224
Fall back!

01:56:26.104 --> 01:56:27.534
Go on, fall back!

01:57:04.242 --> 01:57:05.532
Stop!

01:59:18.066 --> 01:59:19.896
Susan, this is...

01:59:20.006 --> 01:59:22.296
Mr. Tumnus!

01:59:23.106 --> 01:59:26.336
Come, we must hurry
and search the castle.

01:59:26.446 --> 01:59:29.176
Peter will need everyone we can find.

01:59:34.946 --> 01:59:36.316
Ah!

01:59:55.834 --> 01:59:58.394
Edmund! There's too many!

01:59:58.504 --> 02:00:00.024
Get out of here!

02:00:00.144 --> 02:00:03.044
Get the girls and get them home!

02:00:05.544 --> 02:00:08.034
You heard him! Let's go!

02:00:27.634 --> 02:00:29.224
Peter said get out of here!

02:00:29.334 --> 02:00:31.134
Peter's not king yet.

02:01:42.370 --> 02:01:43.960
Ah!

02:02:08.428 --> 02:02:09.728
Impossible!

02:02:46.068 --> 02:02:47.698
Ah!

02:03:24.266 --> 02:03:25.566
It is finished.

02:03:27.106 --> 02:03:29.436
- Peter!
- Peter!

02:03:35.076 --> 02:03:37.176
Where's Edmund?

02:03:48.754 --> 02:03:50.554
Edmund!

02:03:50.624 --> 02:03:51.714
Ah!

02:04:43.212 --> 02:04:45.642
When are you gonna learn
to do as you're told?

02:06:21.068 --> 02:06:24.008
To the glistening Eastern Sea,

02:06:24.108 --> 02:06:28.568
I give you Queen Lucy the Valiant.

02:06:53.366 --> 02:06:55.766
To the great Western Wood,

02:06:55.866 --> 02:07:00.166
King Edmund the Just.

02:07:01.306 --> 02:07:04.506
To the radiant Southern Sun,

02:07:05.616 --> 02:07:09.306
Queen Susan, the Gentle.

02:07:10.156 --> 02:07:13.316
And to the clear Northern Sky,

02:07:13.426 --> 02:07:17.086
I give you King Peter,

02:07:17.196 --> 02:07:19.486
the Magnificent.

02:07:22.966 --> 02:07:25.894
Once a King or Queen of Narnia,

02:07:25.994 --> 02:07:29.194
always a King or Queen.

02:07:29.304 --> 02:07:31.034
May your wisdom grace us

02:07:31.134 --> 02:07:34.234
until the stars rain down
from the heavens.

02:07:34.344 --> 02:07:36.674
Long live King Peter!

02:07:36.774 --> 02:07:39.404
Long live King Edmund!

02:07:39.514 --> 02:07:42.034
Long live Queen Susan!

02:07:42.144 --> 02:07:45.484
Long live Queen Lucy!

02:08:09.742 --> 02:08:11.372
Don't worry.

02:08:13.382 --> 02:08:15.312
We'll see him again.

02:08:15.412 --> 02:08:18.972
- When?
- In time.

02:08:19.082 --> 02:08:23.852
One day he'll be here
and the next he won't.

02:08:25.692 --> 02:08:27.592
But you mustn't press him.

02:08:28.462 --> 02:08:31.452
After all, he's not a tame lion.

02:08:32.132 --> 02:08:34.362
No.

02:08:34.462 --> 02:08:36.362
But he is good.

02:08:37.132 --> 02:08:38.722
Here.

02:08:40.372 --> 02:08:42.602
You need it more than I do.

02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:40.488
Are you all right, Philip?

02:09:40.598 --> 02:09:42.858
I'm not as young as I once was.

02:09:45.398 --> 02:09:47.198
Come on, Ed.

02:09:47.668 --> 02:09:50.638
- Just catching my breath.
- That's all we'll catch at this rate.

02:09:50.738 --> 02:09:53.068
- What did he say, Susan?
- "Wait in the castle.

02:09:53.168 --> 02:09:56.368
I'll get the stag myself."

02:10:00.718 --> 02:10:02.508
What's this?

02:10:08.058 --> 02:10:10.418
It seems familiar.

02:10:12.888 --> 02:10:14.788
As if from a dream.

02:10:14.898 --> 02:10:16.918
Or a dream of a dream.

02:10:20.238 --> 02:10:22.498
Spare Oom.

02:10:25.366 --> 02:10:27.896
- Lucy!
- Not again.

02:10:29.636 --> 02:10:32.106
- Lu?
- Come on!

02:10:43.116 --> 02:10:44.646
These aren't branches.

02:10:46.186 --> 02:10:47.126
Ow! Ooh!

02:10:47.256 --> 02:10:50.286
- They're coats.
- Susan, you're on my foot!

02:10:50.396 --> 02:10:52.556
Peter, move off!

02:10:52.666 --> 02:10:54.786
- Stop shoving.
- Stop it!

02:10:54.896 --> 02:10:56.696
I'm not on your toe!

02:11:11.814 --> 02:11:13.444
Oh!

02:11:14.554 --> 02:11:16.104
There you are.

02:11:18.724 --> 02:11:21.454
What were you all
doing in the wardrobe?

02:11:23.394 --> 02:11:26.154
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, sir.

02:11:31.964 --> 02:11:33.594
Try me.

02:12:36.462 --> 02:12:39.190
I don't think
you'll get back in that way.

02:12:42.330 --> 02:12:46.960
You see... I've already tried.

02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:51.010
Will we ever go back?

02:12:51.110 --> 02:12:52.770
Oh, I expect so.

02:12:53.950 --> 02:12:56.880
But it'll probably happen
when you're not looking for it.

02:12:59.450 --> 02:13:01.040
All the same...

02:13:01.150 --> 02:13:03.640
best to keep your eyes open.
