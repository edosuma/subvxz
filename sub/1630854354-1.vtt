01:06.625 --> 01:08.125
Can I get some help in here?

01:08.208 --> 01:10.333
<i>Code Blue, section 12.</i>

01:13.000 --> 01:13.875
<i>Code Blue…</i>

01:13.958 --> 01:15.625
I need some help, please!

01:16.791 --> 01:18.083
What's going on?

01:18.166 --> 01:21.208
Came in, he was seizing,
then he started coding.

01:21.291 --> 01:24.166
-I'll get the bag.
-What's going on, Charlie?

01:24.250 --> 01:27.500
I came in, he was seizing,
he went into V-tach, and then he coded.

01:27.583 --> 01:29.791
-Let's swap compressions.
-Okay.

01:29.875 --> 01:32.166
In three, two, one…

01:32.750 --> 01:34.416
-Good swap.
-<i>Section 12…</i>

01:34.500 --> 01:36.125
Breath, two, three, four…

01:36.208 --> 01:38.208
Okay, what's going on in here?

01:38.291 --> 01:41.458
I heard the alarm from the hall.
I came in and saw he was seizing,

01:41.541 --> 01:43.500
silenced the vent,
noticed he was in V-tach,

01:43.583 --> 01:44.750
and then he went asystolic.

01:44.833 --> 01:46.625
-Compressions.
-Watch out.

01:46.708 --> 01:49.375
No epi yet.
He's about a minute into compressions.

01:49.458 --> 01:51.791
Okay. Let's get the epi started, please,

01:51.875 --> 01:53.708
and let's pause in a minute
for a pulse check.

01:53.791 --> 01:54.666
Copy that.

01:55.291 --> 01:56.291
Breath.

01:56.958 --> 01:58.000
Quick compressions.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.666
-12, 13, 14, 15.
-Breath.

02:01.666 --> 02:03.458
-Breath, two.
-Two, three.

02:03.541 --> 02:06.916
-Breath.
-Six, seven, eight, nine, ten…

02:07.000 --> 02:08.208
Let's pause for a pulse check.

02:08.291 --> 02:10.250
14, 15. No pulse.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.375
-Is that a shockable rhythm?
-Yeah, it's shockable.

02:12.458 --> 02:14.958
-Uh, let's charge 150 joules.
-Charging.

02:15.041 --> 02:18.041
-Breath.
-Ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

02:18.541 --> 02:20.208
-Quick compressions.
-Come on.

02:20.291 --> 02:21.125
Five, six…

02:21.208 --> 02:23.041
-Keeping compressions.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.916
-Clear for the shock.
-You all clear?

02:25.000 --> 02:26.208
-Clear.

02:26.291 --> 02:29.083
Back on the chest.
Let's get another round of epi, please.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.958
-A little deeper with our compressions.
-Breath.

02:34.083 --> 02:35.250
Breath. Hold.

02:35.833 --> 02:38.250
-Keep your compressions.
-Talk to me.

02:38.916 --> 02:41.583
-Good compressions.
-Breath, two, three, four.

02:41.666 --> 02:43.416
-Breath.
-13, 14, 15.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.708
-Breath.
-Can I get an epi standing by?

02:45.791 --> 02:47.791
Four, five, six, seven…

02:47.875 --> 02:50.291
-And charge.
-Ten, 11, 12, 13.

02:50.375 --> 02:53.166
-All right, let's pull back.
-All clear. All is clear.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.458
-All clear.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.333
-Back on.

02:57.041 --> 02:59.458
-Three, two, one…
-Breath.

03:00.625 --> 03:02.791
-Breath.
-Faster compressions, please.

03:02.875 --> 03:03.791
Breath.

03:03.875 --> 03:05.041
14, 15…

03:06.791 --> 03:08.291
200 joules. Let's hit him.

03:08.958 --> 03:10.000
Breath.

03:10.916 --> 03:12.375
-Breath.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.416
-Hit him again.

03:16.250 --> 03:17.291
Back on.

03:18.250 --> 03:19.083
Breath.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.250
-I'm not getting anything.
-Breath.

03:21.333 --> 03:24.000
Ten, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

03:24.791 --> 03:26.708
-Fuck.
-Three, four, five…

03:26.791 --> 03:30.541
-Easing compressions.
-Eight, nine, ten, 11, 12, 13…

03:30.625 --> 03:32.291
-All right.
-14, 15.

03:32.375 --> 03:33.541
He's had enough.

03:36.833 --> 03:38.291
Mark the time of death.

03:39.166 --> 03:40.666
And let's call his wife.

04:52.166 --> 04:54.125
-Almost there.

04:54.208 --> 04:55.250
Oh.

04:55.333 --> 04:58.375
-How long have you two been married?
-Three years.

04:58.458 --> 05:01.666
Wow. Couple o' newlyweds.

05:05.791 --> 05:08.208
You know, baby, I love you so much.

05:08.708 --> 05:11.291
All right. I have got it.

05:12.375 --> 05:13.791
-All right.
-Oh.

05:16.291 --> 05:18.291
Can we get her some water, please?

05:18.375 --> 05:21.250
Sorry, she can't have any until tomorrow.
She still might choke.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.583
But here.

05:22.666 --> 05:24.458
This is gonna make her feel better.

05:29.041 --> 05:32.291
-I have to go, but I'll be back.
-No. No, you can't go.

05:32.375 --> 05:35.333
You know the rules.
I'm not allowed to stay.

05:35.416 --> 05:38.291
Hey, Sam, this chair reclines.

05:38.375 --> 05:40.541
You want a blanket and pillow?

05:41.291 --> 05:43.125
Yeah. Thanks. Yeah.

05:43.666 --> 05:45.833
Okay. I won't tell if you don't.

05:45.916 --> 05:47.750
-I'll be right back.
-Thanks.

05:48.833 --> 05:51.333
You've pushed a liter.
I don't understand why his pressure's low.

05:51.416 --> 05:54.041
They don't know, but they want
another set of labs at midnight.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.000
Okay, what about Holly?

05:57.083 --> 05:59.375
Holly is stable,
but they still need to get--

05:59.458 --> 06:00.416
Amy.

06:00.916 --> 06:03.250
I'd like to have a word with you
about 310.

06:04.666 --> 06:05.666
Jeez.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.125
You let a relative sleep over?

06:15.208 --> 06:18.041
An old man, yeah.
He was exhausted, and it was 1:00 a.m.

06:18.125 --> 06:21.125
We don't have the staff
to run a hotel for relatives.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.708
Management has got me
rationing coffee filters.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.166
Every penny is like a freaking prisoner.

06:28.250 --> 06:31.500
I had to beg Linda Garran for extra staff.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.000
Right.

06:34.375 --> 06:37.750
But I got nights some help, okay?

06:37.833 --> 06:41.375
A new guy, tons of experience,
great recommendations.

06:42.208 --> 06:44.375
-Oh.

06:45.000 --> 06:45.916
Great.

06:46.416 --> 06:48.291
-You're welcome.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.750
-It's Viv.

06:53.125 --> 06:54.833
Hey, Holly, it's Amy.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.583
All right,
I'm just gonna turn you a little bit.

06:59.083 --> 07:00.458
Just put this arm down.

07:02.041 --> 07:05.916
Hey, I ran into your sister
when I started my shift.

07:06.500 --> 07:10.000
She's so nice. Did you guys
have a good time together?

07:11.791 --> 07:14.250
I can't believe she's got twins.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.333
I don't know how…

07:18.416 --> 07:19.375
she does that.

07:19.458 --> 07:20.708
Okay.

07:26.208 --> 07:29.208
One, two, three.

07:32.125 --> 07:34.375
Okay, one…

07:43.458 --> 07:44.333
Ah…

08:46.916 --> 08:49.541
How was the fried chicken?
Did you do the paper bag shake?

08:49.625 --> 08:53.625
Yeah, I did the whole thing.
Whatever Julia Child said, I did.

08:54.708 --> 08:56.083
-Amazing.
-Um…

08:56.791 --> 09:00.916
Uh, I think… you still owe me
for last Friday.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.750
But… But it can wait, really.

09:02.833 --> 09:04.333
Oh no! I'm sorry.

09:04.416 --> 09:06.375
No, really, it's okay.

09:06.458 --> 09:07.875
I'm such an idiot.

09:08.666 --> 09:11.333
-Okay, 20, 40…
-Listen, you really don't have to do this.

09:11.416 --> 09:13.958
-I don't need it all.
-Six, seven… No, no, no. Eight, nine…

09:14.041 --> 09:16.625
Come on. Here, take it.
There's 50. Sorry about that.

09:16.708 --> 09:18.666
-Thank you. I'm sorry too.
-It's yours.

09:20.333 --> 09:23.000
Come on, Mr. Teddy.
We're going to school!

09:23.083 --> 09:26.625
I think we talked about Mr. Teddy
not going to school before.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.875
-Thanks, Mom.
-Come here, Mr. Bag.

09:29.958 --> 09:30.958
I'm ready.

09:36.416 --> 09:37.833
-Bye.
-Have the best day.

09:37.916 --> 09:39.083
-Bye!
-Love you!

09:39.166 --> 09:42.125
-You need some milk, by the way.
-Okay. I'll get it.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.041
-See you later.
-Thanks.

09:47.291 --> 09:48.791
Off to class, girls.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.166
Hmm.

10:16.375 --> 10:18.541
So it's not the news
we were hoping for.

10:18.625 --> 10:19.583
Hmm.

10:20.541 --> 10:21.875
How bad we talkin'?

10:21.958 --> 10:23.333
If you continue like this,

10:23.416 --> 10:26.791
you're looking at a serious
coronary incident within months,

10:26.875 --> 10:28.041
which could be fatal.

10:32.958 --> 10:35.333
At the last appointment,
you said that there were options.

10:35.416 --> 10:37.916
I know, but that was
before we got these results.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.083
This is now about
keeping your heart going long enough.

10:42.916 --> 10:43.916
For what?

10:45.541 --> 10:47.375
To get you on the transplant list.

10:51.041 --> 10:54.291
And you'll have to stop working,
take medical leave.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.583
I can't. I need health insurance,

10:58.666 --> 11:01.125
and I don't get paid leave
until I've been there a year.

11:04.541 --> 11:05.791
You have kids, right?

11:06.916 --> 11:07.791
Mm-hmm.

11:09.291 --> 11:12.000
Well, you're at high risk for a stroke.

11:12.083 --> 11:14.083
You should make them aware
of the symptoms.

11:14.583 --> 11:19.333
The early warning signs of an episode
are breathlessness, pressure in the chest,

11:19.416 --> 11:20.625
feeling weak or faint.

11:20.708 --> 11:24.833
You need to tell them in case
something should happen at home. Okay?

11:29.750 --> 11:31.208
-Hi. Loughren.
-Mm-hmm.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.541
I'm checking out.

11:33.208 --> 11:34.375
Sure.

11:34.916 --> 11:37.041
-So I see you're not covered?
-Nope.

11:38.541 --> 11:42.083
With the test
and consultation, it'll be $980.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.208
Um…

11:49.291 --> 11:50.625
Can I split it in two?

11:51.625 --> 11:52.625
Sure thing.

12:29.041 --> 12:32.083
<i>Maria, can you turn me up? Watch TV.</i>

12:32.166 --> 12:34.291
<i>…vitamin D. Thank you.</i>

12:51.291 --> 12:52.250
-Hey.
Oh.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.583
-You the new guy?
Ah, yeah, Charlie.

12:54.666 --> 12:55.916
Hi, Charlie. Amy.

12:56.541 --> 12:58.458
-Oh, hey, Amy.
-Nice to meet you.

13:00.041 --> 13:01.791
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

13:02.291 --> 13:05.208
-Did anyone give you the tour yet?
-Uh, no, not yet.

13:05.291 --> 13:08.458
-I got my patients, but, um…
-Okay, come on, let me show you around.

13:08.541 --> 13:10.333
The computer's free for all.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.333
There's a code to access the bathroom,
very importantly,

13:13.416 --> 13:16.125
the highly original code 4321.

13:16.208 --> 13:17.416
Uncrackable.

13:17.958 --> 13:18.791
Ha!

13:19.541 --> 13:21.250
Uh, you ever work with PYXIS?

13:21.333 --> 13:23.958
Yeah, but I think
we had the '97 model. The, um…

13:24.041 --> 13:25.875
Huh, okay, come on. Let me show you.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.833
Put in your nurse ID.

13:30.791 --> 13:32.500
And then your code.

13:35.458 --> 13:37.125
You put in what you need.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.083
And the amount.

13:45.125 --> 13:48.833
Take it out. One, two, three, four, five.
Close the drawer.

13:48.916 --> 13:50.166
-Got it?
-Yeah.

13:50.833 --> 13:53.708
Uh, they said you had a lot of experience.
Where'd you work at before?

13:53.791 --> 13:55.541
I've been all over, really.

13:55.625 --> 13:58.458
-Florians, Vance, Shawlands, St. Aloysius.
-Shawlands.

13:58.541 --> 14:00.416
A girl I trained with works at Shawlands.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.375
-Oh, yeah?
-Lori.

14:01.458 --> 14:02.500
-Lucas?
-Yes.

14:02.583 --> 14:06.583
Yeah, we worked together a lot.
She's great. She's an amazing nurse.

14:06.666 --> 14:08.541
I haven't talked to her forever.

14:08.625 --> 14:10.916
Do they still
call her "Pocket Rocket"?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.750
No. Oh my God. That's hilarious.

14:14.500 --> 14:16.625
I should… I'll call her up
and ask her about that.

14:16.708 --> 14:19.958
Oh God. Please don't.
Don't tell her I told you that.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.375
Who'd they give you tonight?

14:23.625 --> 14:25.500
Uh… Who did they give me?

14:26.083 --> 14:30.416
I have 311, uh, Stevens. 310, Martinez.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.875
Do you know their first names? You guys,
you don't put 'em on the doors here.

14:33.958 --> 14:36.000
You're like me.
First names are always better.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.500
-Ana. Let's start with her.
-Ana.

14:38.583 --> 14:41.875
She presented to the ED
with an adverse reaction to amoxicillin.

14:41.958 --> 14:43.958
Kicker is the prescription
was her husband's,

14:44.041 --> 14:46.125
so insurance is gonna try
to screw them over

14:46.208 --> 14:47.375
if we give 'em a chance.

14:47.458 --> 14:49.875
-So how's the skin?
-Sloughing off at this point.

14:49.958 --> 14:51.416
And what, so clears only?

14:51.500 --> 14:54.166
Yeah. First sip tonight.
Come on. I'll introduce you.

14:54.250 --> 14:55.541
Water later.

14:56.583 --> 14:58.333
Well, hey there, lovebirds.

14:59.541 --> 15:01.416
-Look what I brought.
-Hey.

15:03.541 --> 15:04.583
Here you go.

15:07.166 --> 15:08.000
Mm!

15:08.083 --> 15:09.958
Is that the best thing
you have ever tasted?

15:10.041 --> 15:11.333
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm?

15:11.916 --> 15:13.791
-There you go.

15:13.875 --> 15:16.541
You know what?
Let's start slow, all right?

15:16.625 --> 15:19.125
-I wanna introduce you to Charlie.
-Hey.

15:19.208 --> 15:23.875
He's gonna be your nurse this evening,
but, you know, I'm around if you need me.

15:23.958 --> 15:25.000
Okay?

15:25.333 --> 15:27.541
-So…
-How you doing, Sam? Good?

15:27.625 --> 15:29.666
You let me know when you've had enough.

15:31.791 --> 15:32.625
Mm.

15:32.708 --> 15:35.458
-Okay, is it burning? It burns? Okay.
-I'll check in in a bit.

15:35.541 --> 15:37.583
Well, let's take a pause, okay?

15:38.291 --> 15:43.416
So, um… tell me, I heard
you had a rough couple of days. Yeah?

15:43.500 --> 15:46.375
Well, you guys just push on the button
if you need anything.

15:46.458 --> 15:50.291
Anytime, I'm here.
I'm your Amy for tonight.

15:57.333 --> 15:58.541
-Hey.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.458
Hey.

15:59.541 --> 16:00.958
Uh, so mine are all settled,

16:01.041 --> 16:03.916
so I was just gonna go to the cafeteria,
grab some food.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
-You want something?
-Sorry. Cafeteria closes at 11:00.

16:07.083 --> 16:10.416
-I should've told you that.
-Oh shit. No problem. I'm not that hungry.

16:10.500 --> 16:13.250
-Sorry.
-No. I'll hit up the vending machines.

16:13.333 --> 16:16.541
-Hey, you know what? You like eggs?
-Uh…

16:16.625 --> 16:21.500
I have a large questionable…
…egg salad that I'd prefer to share.

16:21.583 --> 16:23.875
-You know, safety in numbers.
-I'm fine, thank you.

16:23.958 --> 16:27.333
No, no. I'll bring it to the desk
when I'm finished with Holly here.

16:27.416 --> 16:28.791
-You sure?
-Yeah.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.083
'Kay, thanks.

16:34.416 --> 16:35.958
I like the croutons.

16:36.041 --> 16:39.208
-Mm, you mean the soggy crackers?
-That's what they are?

16:39.291 --> 16:41.958
That's the real delicacy of the salad.

16:42.041 --> 16:43.583
Yeah. My eldest daughter made it.

16:43.666 --> 16:46.041
She comes from a long line of women
who can't cook.

16:46.125 --> 16:47.583
What, so your husband cooks?

16:47.666 --> 16:49.541
No, it's just me and my girls.

16:49.625 --> 16:51.500
Oh. I have two girls.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.041
Uh… Four and seven.

16:54.833 --> 16:56.000
Mine are five and nine.

16:56.083 --> 16:57.541
-Oh, yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

16:59.541 --> 17:05.208
I don't live with mine anymore though.
Their mom moved, like, six hours away, so…

17:06.041 --> 17:07.708
That's kinda why I'm here.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.541
-Well, I think this is great.

17:14.416 --> 17:16.083
-Okay.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.041
-Oh, he's--
307.

17:17.125 --> 17:21.541
Yep. Steven. I have about
one minute before he pees.

17:22.791 --> 17:23.750
I got it.

17:25.666 --> 17:26.916
You sure? Thanks.

17:31.083 --> 17:34.875
Hey, Steven. I'm Charlie.
I'm afraid Amy's busy right now, so…

17:34.958 --> 17:37.333
Can I help? A little problem?

17:46.666 --> 17:48.208
Yes, you can!

17:48.291 --> 17:51.000
-Look.
-So what? You don't even like her.

17:51.083 --> 17:54.250
-I do! She's my friend, Jackie!
-Nobody's gonna notice that.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.833
Everybody's gonna notice!

17:55.916 --> 17:57.875
No, they're not. Come on. Really.

17:57.958 --> 18:00.708
Yes, they are! I don't know
why I have to keep using these.

18:00.791 --> 18:01.625
Hey.

18:01.708 --> 18:02.791
It's such crap!

18:02.875 --> 18:05.375
-Stop it! What's going on here?
-You ruined my shoes!

18:05.458 --> 18:06.958
I did not! I tried to help you.

18:07.041 --> 18:10.166
-Would you mind sitting with Maya?
-No, you obviously didn't, Jackie!

18:10.250 --> 18:11.583
-She's in the--
-That's okay.

18:11.666 --> 18:13.166
Why the hell
are you yelling at Jackie?

18:13.250 --> 18:16.125
-She glued the bottom back on.
-It's not a big deal, Alex.

18:16.208 --> 18:18.041
-I can scrape it off.
-You told her to.

18:18.125 --> 18:19.791
Look, it comes right off.

18:19.875 --> 18:22.291
-But it's on both shoes.
-See? I can take it off.

18:22.375 --> 18:23.833
-I'll just--
-No, you can't.

18:23.916 --> 18:26.916
Calm down. It's not the end of the world.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
No.

18:28.083 --> 18:31.000
-Wait. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Listen. I know.
-Stop--

18:31.083 --> 18:34.375
I'm trying, okay? I know you don't have
as much as your friends, but I'm try--

18:34.458 --> 18:36.041
I don't get anything!

18:36.125 --> 18:38.083
-I don't even get to have you.
-I'm sorr…

18:46.875 --> 18:48.375
Oh fuck.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.000
Amy?

20:15.000 --> 20:16.916
What's going on? You okay?

20:18.291 --> 20:19.458
I'm fine.

20:32.250 --> 20:35.208
Okay, well, I'll just sit here
until you feel better, okay?

20:36.083 --> 20:38.125
Now breathe with me.

20:57.833 --> 20:59.291
Keep breathing.

21:04.833 --> 21:05.916
It's okay.

21:09.541 --> 21:11.541
Cardiomyopathy.

21:15.083 --> 21:17.375
Blood blisters on… on my heart.

21:19.416 --> 21:21.333
Okay. So why are you working?

21:22.666 --> 21:24.958
I don't have health insurance.

21:29.958 --> 21:30.791
What about here?

21:30.875 --> 21:33.625
-Did you speak to a cardiologist?
-No, please.

21:33.708 --> 21:34.708
Okay.

21:35.291 --> 21:36.250
Don't tell them.

21:38.375 --> 21:40.041
-I'll get fired.
-Okay.

21:41.333 --> 21:42.875
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

21:44.333 --> 21:45.666
-Okay.
-Yeah.

21:47.583 --> 21:50.791
How much longer do you need to work here
before you get your insurance?

21:52.458 --> 21:54.083
Four months.

21:54.666 --> 21:55.916
Okay.

22:04.625 --> 22:05.708
I can help you.

22:11.125 --> 22:12.166
Come on.

22:15.916 --> 22:17.083
You can do four months.

22:22.500 --> 22:23.625
You're gonna be okay.

22:27.166 --> 22:28.125
Yeah?

22:29.708 --> 22:32.416
-Are you cold?
-Mm-hmm.

22:32.916 --> 22:34.000
Here.

23:17.750 --> 23:20.458
-Something's wrong with the door.
-Oh, it's this.

23:20.541 --> 23:22.291
Ah. Thanks.

23:23.583 --> 23:26.583
-It's gonna be a long night.
-Speaking of energy, how was the park?

23:27.333 --> 23:29.458
-She canceled.
-No!

23:29.541 --> 23:31.458
-Yeah. Moved it to next week.
-Oh, that's hard.

23:31.541 --> 23:33.458
Called just as I was
about to pick up the girls.

23:33.541 --> 23:34.500
Yeah.

23:35.000 --> 23:36.583
Kind of expected it, to be honest.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.000
Uh, one sec.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.166
Hey, what's up? Where's Sonya?

23:40.250 --> 23:41.500
What have we got?

23:41.583 --> 23:45.500
She had a family thing,
so I said I'd do her handover.

23:45.583 --> 23:48.416
-Uh, 310…
-Yeah.

23:48.500 --> 23:51.458
…expired right at shift change.

23:52.541 --> 23:55.375
-Ana?
-Yes. Mrs. Martinez.

23:55.458 --> 23:57.583
Don't ask. I don't know what happened.

23:57.666 --> 24:00.291
The husband was called. He's on his way.

24:00.375 --> 24:02.791
309, he went sideways at around noon…

24:02.875 --> 24:03.958
Ana died.

24:04.041 --> 24:07.708
Should be up around eight.
Respiratory came up. They tubed him…

24:16.958 --> 24:19.250
How could they just leave her
like this?

24:23.375 --> 24:25.625
My mom died in a hospital
when I was a kid.

24:26.333 --> 24:28.750
When I got there to see her, it was…

24:28.833 --> 24:30.791
Well, first of all, they lost the body.

24:31.583 --> 24:34.708
-No.
-Yeah. Insane. Just for a couple of hours.

24:34.791 --> 24:37.208
But, you know, and then
when they did find her, it was this.

24:37.291 --> 24:42.375
She was, like, you know,
half uncovered, naked… Total mess.

24:43.458 --> 24:47.083
For the longest time, that was the memory.
That was how I thought of her.

24:47.166 --> 24:48.416
Oh, Charlie.

24:48.500 --> 24:52.583
So, for me, this is the important part.

24:52.666 --> 24:53.708
Yeah.

24:55.208 --> 24:56.541
Find some dignity.

25:00.208 --> 25:02.250
Mr. Martinez is out there.

25:03.083 --> 25:05.416
He would really like
to speak with you, Amy.

25:08.250 --> 25:09.250
Go.

25:09.916 --> 25:11.916
-You good?
-Yeah, I got this.

25:59.666 --> 26:01.666
22

26:52.166 --> 26:53.916
All right,
so give me the story again.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.250
All right, let me see.
Suspicious death of Mrs. Martinez, Ana.

26:58.916 --> 27:03.083
Presented to the emergency room
with adverse reaction to amoxicillin.

27:04.208 --> 27:06.833
All right, so?
Reacts to some antibiotic. What else?

27:06.916 --> 27:08.500
They're not sure.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.625
-They don't know what killed her?
-No.

27:12.125 --> 27:13.375
How old was she?

27:13.458 --> 27:14.708
Seventy-seven.

27:16.625 --> 27:18.125
Seventy-seven.

27:18.958 --> 27:20.250
So why are we here?

27:27.166 --> 27:28.958
<i>The conference room's</i>
<i>right this way.</i>

27:30.875 --> 27:33.916
Detectives,
Braun, Baldwin, welcome.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.833
I'm Linda Garran, risk manager.

27:35.916 --> 27:37.708
This is Duncan Beattie, attorney.

27:38.291 --> 27:39.750
Our board.

27:39.833 --> 27:43.500
You two might know Malcolm Burrel
from the City Council.

27:43.583 --> 27:46.833
I am a huge supporter of the local force
and the district attorney.

27:46.916 --> 27:49.125
Ah, well, nice to meet you all.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.125
Okay, well, we don't know much.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.125
Just that there's been a death.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.541
An unexplainable incident
in which the patient expired.

28:00.250 --> 28:01.708
Okay. Unexplainable how?

28:03.000 --> 28:05.041
Well, it's the opinion
of the medical experts

28:05.125 --> 28:09.083
that this was an unusual
adverse reaction to medications.

28:09.875 --> 28:13.750
But we found absolutely nothing
to suggest this was intentional.

28:13.833 --> 28:14.708
Then why call us?

28:14.791 --> 28:16.666
We didn't think this was a police matter,

28:16.750 --> 28:19.666
but the Department of Health dictates
when we should reach out,

28:19.750 --> 28:20.916
and here we are.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.375
What are the medications?

28:23.916 --> 28:26.708
Um… Well, all are listed.

28:26.791 --> 28:27.750
Thanks.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.500
It's quite a complicated document.

28:36.291 --> 28:37.708
I'll take my chances.

28:40.125 --> 28:42.250
Well, if you… if you turn
to the third page,

28:42.333 --> 28:46.375
you can see the window in which
patient 1 had abnormal laboratory results

28:46.458 --> 28:47.958
and life-threatening symptoms.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.250
Where's Mrs. Martinez's body?

28:50.333 --> 28:52.208
Uh, released to the family.

28:53.375 --> 28:55.125
They put a lawsuit together?

28:55.916 --> 28:58.208
We don't believe that the family are aware

28:58.291 --> 29:01.958
of the unusual circumstances
around patient 1's expiration.

29:02.833 --> 29:05.375
Isn't that something
you should've disclosed to them?

29:07.666 --> 29:10.041
It was an evolving situation.

29:10.125 --> 29:12.000
Parkfield rightly sought legal counsel

29:12.083 --> 29:14.083
to make sure
everything was done correctly.

29:14.166 --> 29:17.333
Okay, but Mrs. Martinez's body is where?
How do we get it?

29:17.916 --> 29:20.750
It's our understanding
the family have cremated her.

29:23.125 --> 29:24.166
When did she die?

29:25.666 --> 29:26.875
Seven weeks ago.

29:28.541 --> 29:31.208
We were conducting
an internal investigation.

29:31.291 --> 29:32.875
Hence the lag.

29:40.791 --> 29:42.041
Okay.

29:42.541 --> 29:46.750
Well, of course we'll need to interview
all the staff that works in the ICU.

29:48.000 --> 29:51.375
Make way, make way.
I am an important person of the town.

29:51.458 --> 29:55.500
In fact, I am <i>the</i> most important person
of the town,

29:55.583 --> 29:59.833
if not the most important person
west of the Pecos.

30:00.458 --> 30:02.333
"Wherever that is!"

30:02.833 --> 30:04.666
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

30:04.750 --> 30:05.958
"So, what do you do?"

30:06.041 --> 30:08.833
"Do"? I don't do anything. I'm the mayor.

30:08.916 --> 30:09.958
Okay.

30:10.041 --> 30:12.166
"Well, you have to do something now."

30:12.250 --> 30:15.041
"This may be just a one-horse town
without the horse,

30:15.125 --> 30:17.125
but it's been invaded by aliens."

30:17.208 --> 30:20.333
I'll have to look it up
in my book of <i>How to be Mayor.</i>

30:21.125 --> 30:23.500
One. You get to wear a fancy chain.

30:23.583 --> 30:27.666
Two. You get driven around in a big car
by your very own chauffeur.

30:27.750 --> 30:28.750
Three…

30:36.000 --> 30:36.875
Om nom!

30:36.958 --> 30:38.291
You eat. It's…

30:42.708 --> 30:45.125
"Three. You eat and drink for fr--"

30:45.208 --> 30:48.000
-I'm never gonna get this part!
-Don't get frustrated, honey.

30:48.083 --> 30:49.916
Are you kidding? This is great, Alex.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.041
No, and the teacher said that I should
wear a suit and have a mustache.

30:54.125 --> 30:58.458
Dress like a man because I'm the mayor.
He said a girl mayor would be weird.

30:58.541 --> 31:00.291
Women can be mayors.

31:00.375 --> 31:01.458
I told him that, but--

31:01.541 --> 31:05.333
It's a play about an alien invasion,
and the female mayor's the weird part?

31:05.416 --> 31:07.166
-Screw that guy.

31:07.250 --> 31:08.750
-I'm here!
-Hey!

31:08.833 --> 31:11.250
-Jackie!
-No! You can't go yet.

31:11.333 --> 31:14.458
-Oh, sorry, kiddo.
-Come on, sweetheart.

31:14.541 --> 31:16.916
-Come here.
-Guess what I brought you.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.541
Okay, take my hands.

31:19.958 --> 31:21.250
Repeat after me.

31:22.625 --> 31:24.875
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

31:24.958 --> 31:26.791
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

31:26.875 --> 31:28.875
I am the <i>mayor</i> of Humdrum Falls.

31:28.958 --> 31:30.458
I am the <i>mayor</i> of Humdrum Falls.

31:30.541 --> 31:33.375
-I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.
-I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

31:33.458 --> 31:35.291
I am the mayor of Humdrum Falls.

31:35.375 --> 31:36.291
You got this.

31:36.916 --> 31:38.583
Cream and two sugars.

31:40.750 --> 31:42.833
They send over
that internal investigation yet?

31:42.916 --> 31:47.375
Oh, not yet. They say they need more time
to compile all the relevant files.

31:47.458 --> 31:49.375
Seven weeks wasn't enough of a head start?

31:49.458 --> 31:50.583
You'd think.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.833
You want me to

31:55.833 --> 31:57.541
go through the staff?

31:57.625 --> 31:58.666
Already did.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.500
One of the nurses
had a criminal trespass charge

32:01.583 --> 32:03.166
over in Pennsylvania.

32:03.875 --> 32:04.958
Oh yeah? A nurse?

32:05.041 --> 32:08.208
Yeah, a male nurse.
Charles Cullen. C-U-L-L-E-N.

32:08.291 --> 32:09.291
Huh. When?

32:09.375 --> 32:11.458
Uh, eight years ago.

32:11.541 --> 32:14.250
-What district was it in Pennsylvania?
-Palmer.

32:18.791 --> 32:20.416
<i>-Palmer Police Department.</i>
Hello, ma'am.

32:20.500 --> 32:24.083
I'm Detective Braun with Homicide
in the Prosecutor's Office in New Jersey.

32:24.166 --> 32:26.916
I need some background
on a guy you picked up there in '95.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.291
Could you pull the case jacket for me?

32:29.875 --> 32:32.291
<i>-Do you have a name for me?</i>
-It's Charles Cullen.

32:32.375 --> 32:35.875
<i>-Oh, there's a Post-it note on the file.</i>
There's a Post-it note on the file.

32:35.958 --> 32:38.500
She's not sure if it's supposed to
be there. Can you spell that?

32:38.583 --> 32:39.958
<i>It says "digoxin."</i>

32:40.041 --> 32:43.083
Digoxin? What is that?
A medicine or something?

32:46.625 --> 32:48.583
Uh, you got anything else on him?

32:48.666 --> 32:50.083
<i>Picked up for trespassing and…</i>

32:50.166 --> 32:53.916
Okay. Picked up for trespassing
and harassment in '95.

32:54.000 --> 32:56.875
Says he slashed a coworker's tires
after they broke up.

32:56.958 --> 32:58.583
<i>The charges were dropped.</i>

32:58.666 --> 33:00.291
-What's that?
<i>-Yep, all charges.</i>

33:00.375 --> 33:01.625
Charges were dropped?

33:01.708 --> 33:03.583
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Oh.

33:04.791 --> 33:06.125
Okay, thanks so much.

33:06.208 --> 33:07.458
<i>-Yep.</i>
-Bye-bye.

33:11.625 --> 33:12.958
Something's not right.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.625
Parkfield waited almost two months
to report it.

33:16.708 --> 33:18.708
Internal investigation
you don't wanna share.

33:18.791 --> 33:19.875
Expensive lawyers.

33:22.500 --> 33:23.500
Okay.

33:24.500 --> 33:25.500
Well…

33:27.291 --> 33:30.041
What possible reason could they have
for covering up a death?

33:30.125 --> 33:31.541
Right? What are the motives?

33:31.625 --> 33:34.541
It's a business. There's never
a better motivation than money

33:34.625 --> 33:36.083
when it comes to that shit, right?

33:44.916 --> 33:48.000
Hello? You can keep eating.

33:48.083 --> 33:50.458
We won't take up too much of your time.

33:50.541 --> 33:54.916
We just wanna make you aware
of an event the hospital is looking into.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.458
We wanted to assure you all
that the board and I

33:57.541 --> 34:00.750
are dealing with the incident
and everything connected to it.

34:00.833 --> 34:03.291
But we thought it best
to bring you all together,

34:03.375 --> 34:07.500
make everyone universally aware
that the police are also involved.

34:07.583 --> 34:09.083
-And that--
-What is this about?

34:10.750 --> 34:14.458
Uh, there's been an issue
with a patient's death in the ICU.

34:14.541 --> 34:18.208
Was the death suspicious?
I mean, if the police are investigating…

34:18.291 --> 34:22.000
I wanna be clear. <i>We</i> are investigating
with the assistance of the local police.

34:22.083 --> 34:24.208
-Do you know which patient?
-No.

34:24.291 --> 34:27.708
But due to the fact
that outside investigation is involved,

34:27.791 --> 34:30.208
uh, Mr. Beattie, our attorney, is here,

34:30.291 --> 34:32.833
and he would like
to say something as well.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.000
Thanks.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.583
Yes, uh, I just wanna say

34:38.666 --> 34:41.250
that I'll be discussing
with each of you individually,

34:41.333 --> 34:44.250
but as a blanket statement to all,

34:44.791 --> 34:47.250
I just wanna say that in times like this,

34:47.333 --> 34:51.250
patient confidentiality
has to be an absolute priority.

34:52.208 --> 34:55.583
Your individual contracts
are very precise when it comes to this.

34:55.666 --> 34:57.416
Anyone speaking to the police

34:57.500 --> 35:00.166
without a representative
of the hospital present

35:00.250 --> 35:02.000
would be in breach of their contract.

35:08.375 --> 35:12.833
So at the end of the day,
Mr. Beattie and I are here for you.

35:12.916 --> 35:15.125
Uh, we wanna be present
for any interviews,

35:15.208 --> 35:17.208
because we have
your best interests at heart.

35:18.041 --> 35:20.708
You have full access,
but she's gotta be in the room.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.708
No. Absolutely not. She can't be in there.

35:24.791 --> 35:27.208
That lady's the risk manager.
It's her job to be in there.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.458
Who's gonna talk
if their boss is in the interview?

35:29.541 --> 35:32.958
We don't even know what happened.
We don't even have a body.

35:33.458 --> 35:36.625
The only condition that they asked for
is that she be in the room

35:36.708 --> 35:39.000
and that you don't talk specific
about medications.

35:39.083 --> 35:42.833
I understand them asking for it,
but why did you give it to them?

35:42.916 --> 35:45.166
You're supposed to be the prosecutor.

35:47.083 --> 35:48.166
As far as I can see,

35:48.250 --> 35:50.916
they're cooperating fully
with your investigation.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.875
This is all we have. Is this cooperation?

35:52.958 --> 35:54.583
They told me about that.

35:54.666 --> 35:58.375
They're getting the documents together.
It's done. They're sending it first thing.

35:59.916 --> 36:00.833
Let me ask.

36:01.625 --> 36:04.541
Why would Parkfield
conduct an internal investigation,

36:04.625 --> 36:06.333
a seven-week internal investigation,

36:06.416 --> 36:10.125
then call us in
and put her in the room if it was nothing?

36:12.291 --> 36:13.458
Due diligence.

36:16.291 --> 36:18.875
I'm shutting it down. She's in the room.

36:19.583 --> 36:20.583
Done.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.208
Hi, Amy.

36:31.291 --> 36:32.583
Hi.

36:33.958 --> 36:35.416
Nurse Loughren.

36:35.500 --> 36:38.166
-This is Officer Braun, Baldwin.
-How you doin'?

36:38.250 --> 36:41.083
-What is this about?
-Just some informal questions.

36:41.166 --> 36:44.541
The officers are speaking
to a number of staff in the ICU.

36:45.625 --> 36:46.625
Okay.

36:51.916 --> 36:54.416
Do you remember Ana Martinez?

36:57.291 --> 36:59.000
Yeah, Ana was my patient.

36:59.541 --> 37:03.291
Do you recall anything odd
about what happened to her?

37:04.416 --> 37:05.583
Odd?

37:05.666 --> 37:07.166
Well, she died.

37:07.791 --> 37:11.041
Yeah, and it was very sad. It was sudden.

37:11.666 --> 37:12.708
Sudden?

37:12.791 --> 37:14.875
Well, patients die in the ICU, but…

37:16.625 --> 37:17.625
we didn't expect it.

37:19.916 --> 37:22.916
I don't mean to interrupt.
Can I see you for a minute?

37:24.625 --> 37:27.541
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

37:28.291 --> 37:31.625
This better be important.
I wanted no interruptions.

37:38.833 --> 37:40.625
You see any deviations there?

37:47.708 --> 37:48.666
Mm-mm.

37:52.333 --> 37:54.375
Wait, yeah. Her glucose.

37:54.458 --> 37:55.625
It's, uh…

37:57.625 --> 37:59.500
Yeah, the blood sugars, it's wrong.

37:59.583 --> 38:02.291
Uh, there's no C-peps.

38:02.375 --> 38:04.083
-That's weird.
-What does that mean?

38:04.166 --> 38:08.875
Uh, it means that the insulin
in her system wasn't made in her body.

38:08.958 --> 38:10.500
Someone gave it to her.

38:10.583 --> 38:12.791
So you can tell from that
that she was given insulin?

38:13.375 --> 38:17.208
Well, it's not on the list,
and, you know, she's, uh… not diabetic,

38:17.291 --> 38:20.166
so the insulin would've been
a double medication error,

38:20.250 --> 38:22.041
which is really rare, so…

38:22.125 --> 38:24.083
A double medication error? It's rare?

38:24.166 --> 38:25.333
Yeah.

38:27.041 --> 38:29.708
-Would that have killed her?
-Sure.

38:33.916 --> 38:34.916
Sorry.

38:36.416 --> 38:38.291
-Where were we?

38:38.375 --> 38:39.583
Uh, let's see. Oh.

38:39.666 --> 38:43.666
Can you tell us anything
about your coworkers?

38:43.750 --> 38:46.833
You don't mind if she answers a question
about a colleague, do you, Ms. Garran?

38:46.916 --> 38:48.500
-Of course not.
-Good

38:48.583 --> 38:51.000
We understand
that you work with a Charlie Cullen.

38:52.250 --> 38:54.708
-Yeah.
-Could he be involved in this?

38:54.791 --> 38:57.250
I think you're jumping
to conclusions there, Officer.

38:57.333 --> 38:58.958
Charlie wasn't there.

38:59.041 --> 39:02.208
I mean, Ana died on the day shift.
Charlie and I both work nights.

39:02.291 --> 39:06.541
We have no reasons to suspect
it was anything other than an accident.

39:06.625 --> 39:07.791
Thank you, Amy.

39:09.291 --> 39:10.833
I know Charlie really well.

39:10.916 --> 39:14.458
We work every shift together,
and he's a very good nurse.

39:14.541 --> 39:16.375
He wouldn't have made a mistake like that.

39:16.458 --> 39:17.500
Thank you, Amy.

39:22.125 --> 39:25.916
-So where's that internal investigation?
-We're still reviewing everything.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.625
Well, we don't need you to review it.
We'll just take it as it is.

39:31.166 --> 39:33.750
I'll instruct the team
to send you the boxes tomorrow.

39:33.833 --> 39:38.625
But I hope you can deduce
that, um… it's been a tough seven weeks.

39:38.708 --> 39:39.750
Eight.

39:40.833 --> 39:42.291
It's been eight weeks.

39:42.375 --> 39:45.250
- Jack Ivins. July 19, '88.

39:45.333 --> 39:49.500
Recovering from gallbladder surgery
on Thursday. There was no complications.

39:50.916 --> 39:51.750
Line in.

39:51.833 --> 39:55.416
Gonna need you to get ready
to do another shock, 150 joules.

39:56.291 --> 39:58.208
-Everybody clear.
-Clear.

39:58.291 --> 40:00.250
Deliver the shock. Shock.

40:00.750 --> 40:01.958
Resume compressions.

40:02.666 --> 40:05.666
One and two and three and four
and five and six…

40:05.750 --> 40:09.000
-Compressions.
-Nine, ten, 11, 12, 13…

40:09.083 --> 40:11.166
Hold compressions.
Let's check for a rhythm.

40:11.250 --> 40:13.416
-I got nothing.
-Persistent V-fib.

40:13.500 --> 40:14.583
Resume compressions.

40:15.708 --> 40:19.000
Let's get one milligram
of epinephrine IV started.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.166
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten…

40:21.250 --> 40:24.500
Let's get prepared
to give it another shock, 200 joules.

40:24.583 --> 40:26.375
Epi ready. In line.

40:26.458 --> 40:27.875
Continue your breathing.

40:27.958 --> 40:30.083
-Twenty.
-Keep your compressions.

40:30.708 --> 40:32.083
Talk to me.

40:32.166 --> 40:33.833
-Is that epi ready?

40:33.916 --> 40:37.625
Swap in, five, four, three, two…

40:37.708 --> 40:40.125
-You're all clear.

40:40.208 --> 40:42.166
-Oxygen's clear.

40:42.250 --> 40:45.125
I'm moving in.
Low pulse, low pulse.

40:45.208 --> 40:48.000
-Shit, no pressure, still.

40:48.083 --> 40:49.875
Four and five and six and seven

40:49.958 --> 40:54.125
and eight and nine, ten,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15.

40:54.208 --> 40:55.458
Shit.

40:55.541 --> 40:57.666
Twenty-five. Now! Now!

41:01.500 --> 41:02.750
Let's go!

41:39.375 --> 41:40.375
Take these.

42:09.916 --> 42:11.291
You'll get fired.

42:15.250 --> 42:17.791
So there's a fault in the PYXIS.

42:17.875 --> 42:21.375
So if you cancel a request late enough,
it opens anyway.

42:22.750 --> 42:24.875
That's stealing meds, Charlie.

42:24.958 --> 42:30.041
Amy, stop. Now, please don't worry.
I'm gonna help you get through this.

42:45.375 --> 42:46.625
Okay, thank you.

42:48.541 --> 42:50.583
Hey, what did he say?

42:59.916 --> 43:03.833
I think he's right.
I think you probably do need to tell Alex,

43:03.916 --> 43:06.625
just in case something happens
and I'm not there.

43:08.958 --> 43:12.166
They don't have anyone but me.
I can't leave them.

43:12.250 --> 43:14.208
No, you're not leaving them, Amy.

43:14.291 --> 43:17.333
That's not happening.
It's… What is it? Two months?

43:17.416 --> 43:18.958
Okay, so I'm gonna help you do this.

43:19.041 --> 43:22.250
Get your surgery, be with your girls.
That's what's happening.

43:25.583 --> 43:26.458
Okay?

43:34.916 --> 43:36.750
But I think you should tell Alex.

44:01.416 --> 44:04.791
I know it sounds scary,
but… it really isn't.

44:05.625 --> 44:08.166
Everybody's hearts
have these ventricles.

44:08.250 --> 44:09.791
-They're just these spaces.
-Yeah.

44:09.875 --> 44:12.666
They're two little spaces
like balloons that fill with blood.

44:12.750 --> 44:15.166
-They move the blood around the body.
-Mm-hmm.

44:16.291 --> 44:20.250
And um… mine, they just, you know,

44:21.583 --> 44:27.208
they're too big,
and they just got a little thin.

44:31.250 --> 44:33.333
But I am gonna be okay.
I've got medication.

44:33.416 --> 44:38.750
I have doctors taking care of me,
and I'm gonna feel normal soon.

44:40.083 --> 44:42.666
But your mom's gonna need our help, Alex.

44:43.166 --> 44:48.500
If she were to fall
or, um, you know, start speaking funny,

44:48.583 --> 44:51.958
or you struggle to wake her or something,

44:52.041 --> 44:54.000
then you just…
you put Maya in front of the TV,

44:54.083 --> 44:56.041
you call 911, and then you call me.

44:56.125 --> 44:58.708
Yeah, but that's not gonna happen.
It's not gonna happen.

45:02.916 --> 45:05.208
Everything's gonna be fine.
I'm gonna be okay.

45:09.083 --> 45:10.833
Can I just go watch some TV?

45:15.208 --> 45:16.208
Okay.

45:20.041 --> 45:21.833
But I'll be here if you wanna…

45:26.458 --> 45:28.083
<i>Charles Cullen with a C.</i>

45:28.166 --> 45:29.375
C-U-L-L-E-N.

45:29.875 --> 45:32.875
<i>Sure. Give me a second</i>
<i>while I pull up his records.</i>

45:33.458 --> 45:34.500
Great, thanks.

45:48.083 --> 45:50.791
<i>Okay, I just need</i>
<i>to check something with my boss.</i>

45:50.875 --> 45:53.125
Okay. Sure.

46:08.083 --> 46:08.916
<i>Hello?</i>

46:09.000 --> 46:12.125
Hello. Detective Braun here.
Uh, who am I talking to?

46:12.208 --> 46:15.041
<i>Mark Rossi.</i>
<i>Attorney for St. Aloysius Hospital Group.</i>

46:15.958 --> 46:19.125
Mr. Rossi, hi.
I'm hoping you can help me out.

46:19.208 --> 46:22.291
I'm looking for some information
on one of your former employees

46:22.375 --> 46:24.250
from back in '96, Charles Cullen.

46:24.333 --> 46:27.916
<i>Our employee data</i>
<i>is treated with strict confidentiality.</i>

46:29.083 --> 46:32.541
I'm just looking to confirm his dates
of employment, not much more than that.

46:32.625 --> 46:35.041
<i>We'd be happy to release</i>
<i>any relevant information</i>

46:35.125 --> 46:37.125
<i>as soon as we see your subpoena.</i>

46:37.208 --> 46:39.416
Okay, yep, thank you so much.

46:39.500 --> 46:40.416
<i>Thank you.</i>

46:40.500 --> 46:41.750
This is a fucking joke.

46:41.833 --> 46:45.208
Whenever they hear his name,
no one wants to say anything.

46:46.250 --> 46:47.541
Detective Baldwin?

46:48.875 --> 46:51.250
-Yeah.
-It's from Parkfield Memorial Hospital.

46:51.333 --> 46:52.958
It's the internal investigation.

46:53.041 --> 46:55.375
-Just need you to sign here.
-All right.

46:56.666 --> 46:59.416
-Need a hand with the boxes?
-No, it's just this.

47:03.041 --> 47:04.375
Have a great day.

47:17.625 --> 47:19.541
-Ms. Garran.
-Detective Baldwin.

47:22.791 --> 47:25.166
Oh, thank you for seeing me.

47:25.250 --> 47:27.083
Anything to help wrap this up.

47:29.750 --> 47:32.333
So, I just have a couple of questions.

47:32.416 --> 47:34.916
The "Pixie" report.
You have all the drug withdrawals--

47:35.000 --> 47:36.333
Uh, PYXIS.

47:37.666 --> 47:38.708
That's right.

47:39.625 --> 47:42.833
Uh, so you've got all
of the, um, drug withdrawals

47:42.916 --> 47:44.166
for all of the nurses on this?

47:44.250 --> 47:45.416
That's correct.

47:45.500 --> 47:48.166
Well, I was hoping
I could get the full report,

47:48.250 --> 47:51.333
because this one only has a short window
around Ana's expiration.

47:51.416 --> 47:55.458
I'm told it only stores the information
for four weeks.

47:55.541 --> 47:59.416
Well, you must have gotten a copy
during the internal investigation, right?

47:59.500 --> 48:01.375
I don't believe we did, no.

48:01.458 --> 48:05.166
I mean, I can check, but, uh…
everything we had was sent to you.

48:06.291 --> 48:08.541
You see, this is page nine,

48:08.625 --> 48:12.166
so pages one to eight
gotta be around here somewhere.

48:13.500 --> 48:14.333
Hmm.

48:15.125 --> 48:17.333
-Uh, I'll be sure to look into it.

48:19.500 --> 48:23.041
Nurse Garran, it's looking a lot like
you're withholding some evidence here.

48:23.750 --> 48:27.375
-I'm not sure I follow--
-Six pages. Where's the rest of it?

48:27.458 --> 48:31.333
I'm sorry. I… I have another meeting,
and I can't shift it--

48:31.416 --> 48:33.083
Oh, I'm not done.

48:33.166 --> 48:35.166
I'm gonna reschedule with your office.

48:38.000 --> 48:38.833
Sit down.

48:38.916 --> 48:41.541
-Excuse me--
-Sit the fuck down!

48:59.375 --> 49:01.166
You know exactly what you're doing.

49:19.541 --> 49:21.666
-Hey, guys.
-Hey.

49:22.625 --> 49:25.375
Um, I know you're not supposed
to have babies in here,

49:25.458 --> 49:28.458
but I really didn't have
anyone else who could take her.

49:29.833 --> 49:32.125
-It's okay.
-Thank you.

49:32.791 --> 49:35.166
-What's her name?
-Vanessa.

49:35.250 --> 49:36.833
Messy Nessie.

49:36.916 --> 49:39.375
-Messy Nessie?
-Uh-huh.

49:39.458 --> 49:43.000
Well, I have two girls, so I hear that.

49:43.083 --> 49:45.166
-Mm.
-How old is she?

49:45.250 --> 49:46.166
Six months.

49:46.250 --> 49:48.166
Oh. She sleeping through the night yet?

49:48.250 --> 49:51.083
-No!
-She must be teething.

49:51.166 --> 49:52.708
-Oh, yeah.
-Uh-huh.

49:55.708 --> 49:59.041
Nurse Loughren? It's not urgent.
There's a Code Purple in 300.

49:59.125 --> 50:00.708
Oh, okay.

50:02.250 --> 50:03.375
What's a Code Purple?

50:03.458 --> 50:05.833
It means pizza's arrived.
Do you want a slice?

50:07.875 --> 50:08.916
Oh.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.458
Well, I can't say no to pizza.

50:10.541 --> 50:11.708
You can't.

50:11.791 --> 50:15.375
Unfortunately, though,
you're gonna have to say no to pizza.

50:15.458 --> 50:16.458
Okay.

50:16.541 --> 50:20.916
But you are healing nicely,
and will be holding Vanessa in no time.

50:21.666 --> 50:24.916
She told me to go fuck myself
15 times on the phone.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.166
Oh my God.

50:27.250 --> 50:28.333
That's not nice.

50:28.416 --> 50:30.750
I haven't even told you the best part.

50:30.833 --> 50:33.916
So now, to try and stop me
from seeing the girls,

50:34.000 --> 50:38.250
she has made up a story
about me being mean to her dog.

50:39.958 --> 50:42.958
I'm not kidding.
It gets better and better.

50:43.041 --> 50:46.666
Honestly, the whole thing
would be hilarious if it wasn't true.

50:47.250 --> 50:48.333
I'm sorry.

50:48.416 --> 50:50.958
No. Are you kidding?
It's my own fault.

50:51.041 --> 50:52.666
I picked a crazy.

50:55.791 --> 50:59.000
<i>Oh, you know,</i>
<i>it works for me.</i>

50:59.083 --> 51:01.375
<i>I mean, it's not, like… quickly.</i>

51:01.458 --> 51:03.500
-<i>Right.</i>
-<i>What did you say?</i>

51:03.583 --> 51:05.125
<i>Nothing. Nothing, bro.</i>

51:05.208 --> 51:07.916
-<i>You said a… word.</i>
<i>I didn't.</i>

51:09.375 --> 51:10.916
Two minutes, girls.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.416
Okay. Do you wanna get
your backpack and coat?

51:13.500 --> 51:15.458
-You want a ponytail for school?
-Sure.

51:19.791 --> 51:21.500
Beautiful hair.

51:23.833 --> 51:25.375
I wish we could stay home.

51:31.541 --> 51:32.958
I wish that too.

51:47.125 --> 51:48.583
-Wanna get your jacket?
-Yeah.

51:48.666 --> 51:49.875
-Love you.
-Love you.

51:57.333 --> 51:59.083
What else is in that?
Anything new?

51:59.166 --> 52:00.125
Um…

52:01.333 --> 52:04.333
Yeah, there was a list
of all the medications

52:04.416 --> 52:06.458
that were in Ana Martinez's system.

52:06.541 --> 52:08.500
-Insulin?
-Yeah, and another one.

52:08.583 --> 52:11.041
Get this. Digoxin.

52:13.250 --> 52:14.416
-Digoxin?

52:14.500 --> 52:15.375
Baldwin!

52:16.833 --> 52:18.875
-Are you serious?
-Shit.

52:19.458 --> 52:20.958
Screaming at her.

52:21.041 --> 52:23.750
Malcolm Burrel from City Council
just called.

52:23.833 --> 52:27.041
Danny will be happy
to apologize to Mrs. Garran.

52:27.125 --> 52:31.000
Well, too late. You've both been banned
from the hospital property.

52:31.083 --> 52:32.500
What?

52:32.583 --> 52:35.333
Can't ban us from the scene of a crime
that we're investigating.

52:35.416 --> 52:37.083
-What crime?
-Homicide.

52:37.166 --> 52:38.791
What do you have to back this up?

52:38.875 --> 52:41.875
The files and an interview with a nurse

52:41.958 --> 52:44.375
who was certain
that the victim was given insulin.

52:44.458 --> 52:45.333
Victim, what victim?

52:45.416 --> 52:46.666
Ana Martinez.

52:46.750 --> 52:48.625
You have no body.

52:48.708 --> 52:52.625
No body, no autopsy.
You know how this works.

53:02.458 --> 53:04.416
Banned from the fuckin' hospital?

53:11.416 --> 53:14.333
Hey, Kelly.
Tom called to check on you.

53:15.250 --> 53:18.958
I cannot get over
how cute that little Vanessa is.

53:20.416 --> 53:22.083
Who's Vanessa?

53:29.791 --> 53:31.916
Kelly, do you know
where you are right now?

53:34.000 --> 53:35.583
I need you to answer me, hon.

53:37.250 --> 53:39.333
I'm at the hospital.

53:39.416 --> 53:40.500
Which hospital?

53:45.083 --> 53:46.208
Uh…

53:46.708 --> 53:47.791
All right.

53:48.416 --> 53:49.583
Squeeze my hands.

53:51.166 --> 53:52.583
Come on. Squeeze my hands.

53:55.125 --> 53:56.250
A little light.

54:04.500 --> 54:06.083
Has Tom come by?

54:09.333 --> 54:10.875
He called to check on you.

54:14.125 --> 54:17.583
-Hey, Tom, it's Amy from the hospital.
<i>-Hi, Amy. What's going on?</i>

54:18.125 --> 54:21.708
I really think that you should come in.
There's been a change overnight.

54:26.125 --> 54:28.791
I think you should come in
sooner rather than later.

54:29.541 --> 54:30.666
Okay, see you soon.

54:31.166 --> 54:33.250
I checked in with Beth.
She's still sleeping.

54:33.333 --> 54:36.333
-Jack's been pushing on his call button--
-Oh my God.

54:36.833 --> 54:37.833
What?

54:38.875 --> 54:40.666
There's insulin in her system.

54:50.333 --> 54:52.625
<i>Code Blue. Wing West.</i>

54:53.500 --> 54:55.541
<i>Code Blue. Wing West.</i>

54:58.250 --> 55:00.291
<i>Code Blue. Wing West.</i>

56:15.583 --> 56:17.916
Oh my God! Oh God!

56:19.166 --> 56:20.250
-No!

56:20.333 --> 56:22.208
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

56:23.958 --> 56:25.958
Oh God!

56:28.166 --> 56:30.000
Oh my God!

56:40.791 --> 56:43.291
-It's okay.

57:18.250 --> 57:19.250
Shit.

57:22.458 --> 57:24.958
Hello. Sorry to bother you like this.

57:25.041 --> 57:26.083
Yeah, no.

57:29.000 --> 57:30.125
We need your help, Amy.

57:30.208 --> 57:33.458
Look, I'm sorry, guys. I… Really,
I don't know what happened to her.

57:34.208 --> 57:35.125
To who?

57:35.791 --> 57:38.125
Kelly Anderson. I… I mean…

57:39.125 --> 57:40.708
Who's Kelly Anderson?

57:41.625 --> 57:43.083
Is there another victim?

57:44.416 --> 57:46.500
Another double-medication error?

57:48.791 --> 57:51.041
Was Cullen with Kelly Anderson?

57:51.541 --> 57:53.166
This has nothing to do with Charlie.

57:53.250 --> 57:55.208
-How well do you know him?
-Really well.

57:55.291 --> 57:56.250
Do you?

57:57.500 --> 57:59.750
He's been at nine hospitals.

57:59.833 --> 58:01.833
And none of 'em will talk to us.

58:02.791 --> 58:04.166
What do you mean? I'm…

58:07.958 --> 58:10.791
No. If something had happened,
he wouldn't have been able to get a job.

58:10.875 --> 58:13.666
-The hospital would have done something.
-You'd think so.

58:13.750 --> 58:14.750
Yeah.

58:16.166 --> 58:17.958
They're stonewalling us.

58:20.166 --> 58:21.750
You have to help us.

58:24.750 --> 58:25.958
Mom, are you coming?

58:27.458 --> 58:31.583
Hey, honey. Yeah, I'll be in in a second.
Just wait inside, okay?

58:31.666 --> 58:32.791
Okay.

58:34.500 --> 58:37.291
Guys, I can't talk right now.
My kid's here. Like…

58:39.958 --> 58:42.458
Okay. Here's my card.

58:43.333 --> 58:46.375
Give me a call.
Maybe he's not who you think.

58:49.291 --> 58:50.458
Have a nice day.

58:50.541 --> 58:51.625
Thanks.

59:14.083 --> 59:15.000
Hey.

59:15.500 --> 59:16.458
Hey.

59:19.666 --> 59:21.583
-Do you need anything?
-Mm-mm.

59:21.666 --> 59:23.125
-No?
-I'm fine.

59:24.083 --> 59:26.250
Okay. You let me know if you feel tired.

59:26.333 --> 59:27.875
I'm not. I will. I feel good.

59:27.958 --> 59:29.000
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

59:31.125 --> 59:32.125
-Okay.
-Mm.

1:00:17.791 --> 1:00:21.041
Amy fucking Loughren!

1:00:21.125 --> 1:00:22.666
-Pocket Rocket!
-Mm!

1:00:24.375 --> 1:00:27.666
-It is so good to see you!
-I know. You look so good.

1:00:27.750 --> 1:00:30.708
-Really?
-Yes! You look great.

1:00:30.791 --> 1:00:32.125
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1:00:32.208 --> 1:00:34.541
-I feel exhausted.
-Hi there! You ready to order?

1:00:34.625 --> 1:00:36.958
-Oh, I'll have a cheese omelet.
-Okay.

1:00:37.041 --> 1:00:39.625
-And what pairs best with that?
-Chardonnay.

1:00:39.708 --> 1:00:43.166
Oh. A large cold glass of dry chardonnay.

1:00:43.250 --> 1:00:44.375
-Okay.
-I'll have the same.

1:00:44.458 --> 1:00:45.791
-Thanks.
-Coming right up.

1:00:45.875 --> 1:00:48.083
When was the last time
we were in this dive?

1:00:48.166 --> 1:00:50.833
A long time ago. Like, at least a decade.

1:00:50.916 --> 1:00:52.583
-What?
-Twelve years?

1:00:52.666 --> 1:00:54.625
-Ugh, Jesus.

1:00:54.708 --> 1:00:56.625
-I'm getting old.
-Here we go.

1:00:56.708 --> 1:00:57.791
Thank you.

1:00:58.333 --> 1:00:59.375
How's Paul?

1:01:00.041 --> 1:01:01.541
Uh, we split up.

1:01:01.625 --> 1:01:03.791
-Oh shit.
-I mean, it's not a big deal.

1:01:03.875 --> 1:01:08.250
It was a long time ago,
and we share custody of the dogs.

1:01:10.583 --> 1:01:14.375
We worked hard to come to that agreement.
I'm so glad that you called.

1:01:14.458 --> 1:01:17.083
Mm! Me too.

1:01:17.166 --> 1:01:19.375
Just, you know, I wanted to…
I wanted to ask you…

1:01:19.458 --> 1:01:21.708
It's… It's a little weird.

1:01:21.791 --> 1:01:22.875
I love weird.

1:01:22.958 --> 1:01:27.250
But, um… do you remember working
with someone named Charlie Cullen?

1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:32.625
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1:01:33.208 --> 1:01:34.041
Why?

1:01:34.125 --> 1:01:36.666
Well, I'm working with him
right now at Parkfield.

1:01:39.666 --> 1:01:41.666
There was a rumor about him.

1:01:41.750 --> 1:01:44.083
That he was responsible for a death.

1:01:44.166 --> 1:01:45.666
That he OD'd someone.

1:01:50.416 --> 1:01:51.416
Oh.

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:53.208
Uh, with what?

1:01:53.291 --> 1:01:56.666
They found insulin
in the dead guy's saline bag.

1:01:56.750 --> 1:01:58.500
They found it in a few.

1:01:59.041 --> 1:02:01.000
Pinpricks in the ones in the store.

1:02:01.083 --> 1:02:04.250
Somebody had dosed them
before they went out.

1:02:07.958 --> 1:02:09.916
Why did they think it was Charlie?

1:02:10.708 --> 1:02:12.000
They didn't.

1:02:12.083 --> 1:02:15.375
But we used to get codes every night.
Sometimes two or three.

1:02:15.458 --> 1:02:16.958
And then after he left,

1:02:18.291 --> 1:02:20.833
we got, like, only one a month.

1:02:28.916 --> 1:02:30.541
You get a lot of codes?

1:03:32.125 --> 1:03:33.166
Okay.

1:03:38.375 --> 1:03:39.500
Oh God.

1:04:02.791 --> 1:04:03.750
Oh!

1:05:07.416 --> 1:05:08.250
Hmm.

1:05:08.333 --> 1:05:09.291
Hey.

1:05:12.166 --> 1:05:13.583
Easy, easy.

1:05:13.666 --> 1:05:16.500
You're okay. You're okay. It's okay.

1:05:17.750 --> 1:05:20.541
-Amy, it's okay.

1:05:21.416 --> 1:05:23.708
You're in the ED. You're doing great.

1:05:26.625 --> 1:05:29.333
I checked on the girls.
Jackie's with them.

1:05:30.708 --> 1:05:32.291
I can go get 'em, bring 'em here.

1:05:32.375 --> 1:05:34.250
- No.
-No? Okay.

1:05:41.708 --> 1:05:42.916
You want some water?

1:05:52.583 --> 1:05:53.583
No?

1:05:59.583 --> 1:06:02.208
Don't you ever scare me
like that again please.

1:06:02.291 --> 1:06:05.166
-I wanna leave.
-I know, I know.

1:06:05.791 --> 1:06:06.625
I get it.

1:06:07.208 --> 1:06:08.875
We're not gonna let them find out.

1:06:10.041 --> 1:06:12.333
Where… Where's the nurse?

1:06:12.416 --> 1:06:15.458
Uh, don't worry.
Your last pressure looked pretty good.

1:06:15.541 --> 1:06:18.208
Your heart rate's been below 80
for the last hour.

1:06:18.708 --> 1:06:22.791
I saw the labs, and your troponin's high,
but it's trending down.

1:06:22.875 --> 1:06:24.625
So you're good. You're okay.

1:06:27.416 --> 1:06:29.791
You're lucky. Could've been a lot worse.

1:06:29.875 --> 1:06:32.250
-I wanna go home.
-I know.

1:06:32.333 --> 1:06:34.708
-Okay.
-Hey. Saw her heart rate blip up.

1:06:34.791 --> 1:06:36.375
-You awake?
-Yeah--

1:06:36.458 --> 1:06:38.166
Bring me a discharge form.

1:06:38.250 --> 1:06:40.791
Hey. I don't think that's a good idea.
She should stay overnight.

1:06:40.875 --> 1:06:42.916
-Yeah, we got this.
-I wanna leave AMA.

1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:44.083
-You sure?

1:06:44.166 --> 1:06:46.875
I'll drive her home.
Make sure she's looked after. Thank you.

1:06:46.958 --> 1:06:49.125
-We're good. Thank you.

1:06:49.916 --> 1:06:50.916
Hey.

1:06:52.208 --> 1:06:54.208
-Please, stop.

1:06:56.416 --> 1:06:57.750
Okay.

1:07:02.083 --> 1:07:03.291
Give me your arm.

1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.375
So you sure you don't want me to come in?

1:07:22.958 --> 1:07:25.541
I'm happy to sleep on the couch. I can…

1:07:29.583 --> 1:07:33.208
-I can take the girls to school.
-I don't wanna scare them.

1:07:35.291 --> 1:07:37.916
Nothing's gonna happen.
I just… I just need to sleep.

1:07:38.416 --> 1:07:40.291
-You're right.

1:07:41.916 --> 1:07:43.541
-Thanks, Charlie.
-Yeah.

1:07:46.791 --> 1:07:48.458
But if you need anything…

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:52.000
I'll call you.

1:07:52.083 --> 1:07:53.041
Yeah?

1:07:58.750 --> 1:08:00.166
It's a month, Amy.

1:08:02.833 --> 1:08:04.041
We got this.

1:08:09.666 --> 1:08:11.416
You're freezing. Go.

1:08:18.875 --> 1:08:19.916
Call me.

1:08:34.166 --> 1:08:35.750
It has to be a secret.

1:08:42.458 --> 1:08:43.791
Oh God.

1:08:46.125 --> 1:08:47.500
No one can know.

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:50.333
I'll get fired.

1:08:51.541 --> 1:08:52.666
Understood.

1:08:54.333 --> 1:08:56.166
He does it in the storage room…

1:08:57.958 --> 1:08:59.458
before it even goes out.

1:09:00.041 --> 1:09:02.208
He injects the insulin into the bags,

1:09:02.291 --> 1:09:05.541
and because it enters
the bloodstream slowly,

1:09:05.625 --> 1:09:08.833
it could take hours
or even, you know, a day to kill someone.

1:09:12.541 --> 1:09:14.750
So he's killing 'em
without ever touching 'em.

1:09:14.833 --> 1:09:18.291
Could he put something other than insulin
inside those bags?

1:09:20.166 --> 1:09:22.500
Yeah, any clear liquid
wouldn't be detected.

1:09:23.250 --> 1:09:25.458
Is digoxin a clear liquid?

1:09:26.791 --> 1:09:27.750
Yeah.

1:09:28.750 --> 1:09:30.250
Could it kill someone?

1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.416
Okay, and the nurse you met with,
you think she'll talk to us?

1:09:43.500 --> 1:09:44.541
No.

1:09:45.125 --> 1:09:46.875
No, she'll lose her job.

1:09:46.958 --> 1:09:51.000
Do you mind taking a look
at what we got here from Parkfield?

1:09:51.083 --> 1:09:52.666
Where's the rest of it?

1:09:52.750 --> 1:09:55.833
That's it. That's all we have.
That's all they gave us.

1:09:56.500 --> 1:09:58.666
The PYXIS report's just two pages.

1:09:59.291 --> 1:10:01.583
They said it only keeps the file
for four weeks.

1:10:01.666 --> 1:10:03.083
No, it's a computer.

1:10:03.166 --> 1:10:06.833
It keeps the information
for as long as it was installed. It's…

1:10:15.541 --> 1:10:20.375
I'll pull Charlie's PYXIS report
from the machine in my ward,

1:10:20.458 --> 1:10:24.250
and we'll use that to prove
that he withdrew insulin

1:10:24.333 --> 1:10:26.291
and digoxin when Ana died.

1:10:26.375 --> 1:10:30.000
Yeah, see, the problem is
that Ana Martinez was cremated,

1:10:30.083 --> 1:10:32.041
so we don't have an autopsy.

1:10:32.833 --> 1:10:35.416
What we need is an actual body.

1:13:48.208 --> 1:13:50.916
As you know, we got permission
from Kelly Anderson's husband

1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.958
to dig up her body for examination.

1:13:53.041 --> 1:13:56.083
From the autopsy, we know
that a combination of insulin and digoxin

1:13:56.166 --> 1:13:57.958
were in Kelly's system
and led to her death

1:13:58.041 --> 1:13:59.541
in the early hours of the 15th.

1:13:59.625 --> 1:14:03.250
Right,
and then on the 14th at 20:47,

1:14:03.333 --> 1:14:08.000
you see that Charlie took out
insulin and digoxin from the PYXIS.

1:14:10.375 --> 1:14:14.041
And if you see Kelly's report,

1:14:14.125 --> 1:14:17.208
her blood sugar just drops at 21:56,

1:14:17.291 --> 1:14:19.916
so that is the insulin taking effect.

1:14:20.416 --> 1:14:22.791
And there's slow arrhythmia at 22:15,

1:14:22.875 --> 1:14:25.000
and that's digoxin.

1:14:25.083 --> 1:14:29.458
So he was holding two murder weapons.
3:57 is the time of death.

1:14:29.541 --> 1:14:30.708
Everything's there.

1:14:30.791 --> 1:14:32.208
Wait a second. Hold on.

1:14:33.125 --> 1:14:37.041
With this PYXIS, it says cancellations,
not withdrawals.

1:14:37.125 --> 1:14:39.000
Well, it's a fault in the system.

1:14:39.083 --> 1:14:42.041
So when you cancel at the last minute,
the drawer opens,

1:14:42.125 --> 1:14:44.166
but it reports it as a cancellation.

1:14:44.250 --> 1:14:45.666
And Cullen knows about that?

1:14:45.750 --> 1:14:47.291
Yeah, and I saw him do it.

1:14:48.041 --> 1:14:50.583
Insulin, digoxin.
There's hundreds of orders here.

1:14:50.666 --> 1:14:55.166
Okay, but not according to this.
This makes it look like he never got 'em.

1:14:56.208 --> 1:14:57.166
But he did.

1:14:57.833 --> 1:14:59.666
Did you actually see him do this?

1:15:08.375 --> 1:15:10.333
Guys, this is the smoking gun right here.

1:15:10.416 --> 1:15:12.791
Yeah, but this isn't.

1:15:12.875 --> 1:15:16.125
It's just cancellations.
There's nothing nefarious.

1:15:16.208 --> 1:15:18.208
There's no proof of guilt. There's--

1:15:18.291 --> 1:15:21.291
Okay, he's been doing this
since he started at Parkfield, so look.

1:15:21.375 --> 1:15:24.625
Look at all
of these repeated cancellations, right?

1:15:24.708 --> 1:15:28.125
Look. They're not followed up
with a correct order.

1:15:28.958 --> 1:15:31.875
He's had repeated orders
of vec and digoxin.

1:15:31.958 --> 1:15:35.333
I mean, it's really--
It just screams wrong. It's…

1:15:35.416 --> 1:15:39.083
Maybe. Maybe Parkfield
just didn't understand.

1:15:39.166 --> 1:15:42.625
Come on, guys.
Linda Garran used to be a nurse.

1:15:43.791 --> 1:15:44.958
She understood.

1:15:46.625 --> 1:15:49.791
Oh yeah, she knows,
and she's not doing anything.

1:16:01.166 --> 1:16:03.750
Nurse Cullen, thank you
for coming in on your day off.

1:16:03.833 --> 1:16:05.750
Hi, you can call me Charlie.

1:16:12.708 --> 1:16:16.083
Uh… We've come across something troubling.

1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:23.000
What hospital were you employed at
before you took the position here?

1:16:24.458 --> 1:16:25.750
St. Elizabeth's.

1:16:26.833 --> 1:16:29.166
And what were your dates
of employment there?

1:16:29.791 --> 1:16:30.750
Uh…

1:16:31.791 --> 1:16:34.625
I'm not sure.
Is there an issue from St. Elizabeth's?

1:16:34.708 --> 1:16:39.416
'Cause I was targeted by some coworkers.
I don't know. Maybe they're at it again.

1:16:39.500 --> 1:16:42.833
What we're concerned with are the dates
you listed on your application.

1:16:42.916 --> 1:16:44.791
Do you remember what they were?

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:46.916
Um…

1:16:50.500 --> 1:16:54.583
June '01 to August '03, maybe.

1:16:54.666 --> 1:16:56.416
-Yes, that's what you wrote.
-Right.

1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:58.750
Those dates are incorrect, Mr. Cullen.

1:16:58.833 --> 1:16:59.791
Oh.

1:16:59.875 --> 1:17:02.833
St. Elizabeth's confirmed with us
that you were employed from May,

1:17:02.916 --> 1:17:06.916
so these discrepancies
on your application form

1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.500
leave us with no option but to let you go

1:17:10.291 --> 1:17:11.875
with immediate effect.

1:17:14.125 --> 1:17:17.666
Wait, so you're firing me for writing
the wrong dates on my application?

1:17:21.916 --> 1:17:23.875
It… It is in the contract.

1:17:32.916 --> 1:17:35.958
Well, I believe I need to sign something.

1:18:12.958 --> 1:18:13.833
Is that all?

1:18:14.541 --> 1:18:15.750
That's all.

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:25.333
Thank you, Mr. Cullen.

1:19:02.625 --> 1:19:07.416
I just got news from Parkfield.
They've dealt with the Cullen issue.

1:19:07.500 --> 1:19:09.875
-What does that mean?
-He's been fired.

1:19:11.166 --> 1:19:13.583
-What?
-So they're just gonna let him go?

1:19:14.416 --> 1:19:15.750
Well, what did they say?

1:19:15.833 --> 1:19:19.708
That they fired him because they found
some discrepancy in his paperwork.

1:19:20.916 --> 1:19:23.916
Well, what was his state of mind?
Was he stable?

1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:27.791
Wait, you don't think that this could
make him more dangerous, do you?

1:19:27.875 --> 1:19:31.375
At least he can't be
anywhere near patients.

1:19:31.458 --> 1:19:33.250
He can't hurt anyone.

1:19:34.666 --> 1:19:37.625
He's been at nine hospitals. Nine.

1:19:37.708 --> 1:19:39.458
What don't you understand?

1:19:39.541 --> 1:19:42.250
They all say the same thing.
They cover up their own liabilities.

1:19:42.333 --> 1:19:44.541
It happens again and again and again.

1:19:44.625 --> 1:19:46.750
He's gonna get a new job
at another hospital,

1:19:46.833 --> 1:19:48.291
and it's all gonna continue.

1:19:49.958 --> 1:19:51.208
You allowed this.

1:19:54.958 --> 1:19:56.166
Don't look at me.

1:19:56.875 --> 1:19:57.708
You did.

1:20:05.791 --> 1:20:07.625
-Jackie, I'm back.
-Maya.

1:20:08.416 --> 1:20:11.500
-Oh my God!
-Maya! Can you just say your line?

1:20:11.583 --> 1:20:12.666
Hey, girls.

1:20:12.750 --> 1:20:14.083
I forgot it.

1:20:17.625 --> 1:20:18.500
Wow.

1:20:26.083 --> 1:20:27.125
What?

1:20:35.541 --> 1:20:37.291
Don't you have the script?

1:20:39.500 --> 1:20:41.541
-I don't have the script.
-Oh my God.

1:20:41.625 --> 1:20:43.458
Okay, I lost it.

1:20:43.541 --> 1:20:46.250
Maya, you've done this
so many times!

1:20:46.333 --> 1:20:49.125
Okay, Alex, be nice to your sister.

1:20:49.208 --> 1:20:51.125
Maya's speaking
over Charlie's part again.

1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:55.250
What are you doing here?

1:20:56.291 --> 1:20:57.291
Rehearsing.

1:20:59.166 --> 1:21:00.250
Where's Jackie?

1:21:00.833 --> 1:21:03.791
I told her she could go home.
It was just gonna be us tonight.

1:21:03.875 --> 1:21:05.125
We cooked!

1:21:05.208 --> 1:21:07.125
-We did.
-Charlie cooked.

1:21:07.208 --> 1:21:08.875
-I helped.
-No, you didn't.

1:21:08.958 --> 1:21:11.291
-Yes, I did!
-No, you didn't.

1:21:11.375 --> 1:21:13.666
-Yes, I did!
-Alex, we all cooked.

1:21:14.750 --> 1:21:16.208
Why are you being weird, Mom?

1:21:16.833 --> 1:21:17.875
I'm not.

1:21:19.416 --> 1:21:22.458
-We're making something special.
-It's his mom's recipe.

1:21:22.541 --> 1:21:23.791
-Come.
-Yummy!

1:21:23.875 --> 1:21:27.458
Sit, relax.
Enjoy the "Mayor of Humdrum Falls."

1:21:27.541 --> 1:21:29.541
Should we get your mom
to play Mop Hopsley?

1:21:29.625 --> 1:21:30.541
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

1:21:30.625 --> 1:21:31.833
Alex…

1:21:33.708 --> 1:21:35.083
Maya, please come here.

1:21:37.666 --> 1:21:40.333
-Why?
-'Cause I'm asking you to. Come here.

1:21:41.250 --> 1:21:42.125
I don't want to.

1:21:42.208 --> 1:21:43.458
Hey, go to your mom.

1:21:43.541 --> 1:21:44.416
Get over here.

1:21:46.125 --> 1:21:47.375
Get over here right now!

1:21:47.458 --> 1:21:49.625
But why? I'm having fun.

1:21:52.875 --> 1:21:55.041
Go to your room. Go.

1:21:55.833 --> 1:21:57.458
Why is she so angry?

1:21:58.500 --> 1:21:59.583
I don't know.

1:22:05.583 --> 1:22:07.333
So I'm guessing you heard.

1:22:09.625 --> 1:22:10.583
Yeah.

1:22:14.375 --> 1:22:15.583
She say why?

1:22:17.333 --> 1:22:18.250
Mm-mm.

1:22:22.125 --> 1:22:26.958
They fired me because I wrote the wrong
dates on my application form apparently.

1:22:28.083 --> 1:22:29.250
Oh.

1:22:29.333 --> 1:22:30.625
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:22:35.833 --> 1:22:37.875
It's been a wacko day.

1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:44.541
It's been a wacko couple of months.
Actually it's… Ugh.

1:22:45.291 --> 1:22:49.041
You know, I wasn't even meant
to be working here.

1:22:49.125 --> 1:22:52.666
I took this job
because I wanted to be close to my kids.

1:22:52.750 --> 1:22:57.166
Then when I get here,
she won't even let me see them,

1:22:57.250 --> 1:23:01.958
and then she starts making up this
insane stuff about poisoning the dog,

1:23:02.041 --> 1:23:03.791
and then this, you know…

1:23:12.833 --> 1:23:14.916
I think the universe hates me, Amy.

1:23:15.625 --> 1:23:17.333
-Really.
-Charlie--

1:23:17.416 --> 1:23:20.458
-At this point.
-You know that's not true.

1:23:24.291 --> 1:23:26.416
I'm really sorry this happened to you.

1:23:26.500 --> 1:23:30.333
No, please. I'm sorry, 'cause I know
you've still got three more weeks,

1:23:30.416 --> 1:23:32.208
and I'm not gonna be there to help.

1:23:32.291 --> 1:23:33.958
But I can… I can help here.

1:23:34.041 --> 1:23:36.750
I can, like, look after them,
I can make sure you eat.

1:23:36.833 --> 1:23:38.083
Anything you need.

1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:41.625
Really. Anything.

1:23:43.958 --> 1:23:45.458
That's all right.

1:23:51.166 --> 1:23:54.125
Did I tell you
Alex blew up the other day?

1:23:54.208 --> 1:23:55.541
-No.
-Yeah.

1:23:56.041 --> 1:23:57.208
She just lost it.

1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.916
She was crying and screaming,
and, like…

1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:02.541
She's really struggling.

1:24:03.291 --> 1:24:05.458
I'm working so much, so…

1:24:05.541 --> 1:24:08.958
I'm so sorry.
I mean, you know, it's a lot, you know?

1:24:09.458 --> 1:24:13.625
But what I think would be
really helpful to me is, um…

1:24:14.416 --> 1:24:17.000
if I could spend some time alone
with them, you know?

1:24:17.083 --> 1:24:18.583
Just me and the girls.

1:24:22.625 --> 1:24:25.833
And I feel really bad saying this to you,

1:24:25.916 --> 1:24:31.375
because I know that this has been
a day from hell for you.

1:24:31.458 --> 1:24:35.208
I mean, Charlie, honestly,
you've had the year from hell.

1:24:35.291 --> 1:24:36.166
No.

1:24:36.958 --> 1:24:38.291
And, um…

1:24:41.083 --> 1:24:42.916
God, I wish I could be there for you.

1:24:46.125 --> 1:24:48.250
-I just feel like shit. I'm so sorry.
-No.

1:24:48.333 --> 1:24:50.791
Amy, stop. I get it. Please.

1:24:50.875 --> 1:24:53.625
It's… It's your kids. They need this.

1:24:54.250 --> 1:24:55.083
Yeah.

1:24:58.916 --> 1:25:00.333
And you're a good mom.

1:25:01.750 --> 1:25:03.916
-No, look at me.

1:25:06.541 --> 1:25:07.750
You're a good mom.

1:25:13.666 --> 1:25:14.583
Mm.

1:25:16.500 --> 1:25:19.875
-Okay.
-I'm glad I can help.

1:25:26.375 --> 1:25:27.833
Promise me you'll eat.

1:25:29.250 --> 1:25:31.125
-It smells good.

1:25:31.208 --> 1:25:33.291
It's my mom's recipe, you know.

1:25:34.458 --> 1:25:35.916
-Okay.
-You know what?

1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:39.291
Just, actually, just, like, sitting here,
talking to you,

1:25:39.375 --> 1:25:40.875
being with you…

1:25:42.625 --> 1:25:44.875
it made me realize
everything's gonna be okay.

1:25:44.958 --> 1:25:46.041
I've got you.

1:25:46.708 --> 1:25:50.041
I got Maya and Alex. I got my girls.

1:25:51.375 --> 1:25:53.250
It's a job. I can get a job.

1:25:55.375 --> 1:25:56.416
You can.

1:26:06.125 --> 1:26:07.166
Yeah.

1:26:14.750 --> 1:26:15.791
Night.

1:27:28.625 --> 1:27:29.791
Charlie? Hey.

1:27:30.500 --> 1:27:31.416
<i>Oh, hey.</i>

1:27:32.166 --> 1:27:33.375
-I was, um--
<i>-You okay?</i>

1:27:33.458 --> 1:27:35.250
Yes! I…

1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:40.416
You know, I wanna apologize
for being so weird yesterday.

1:27:40.500 --> 1:27:42.416
Like, last night, it was just…

1:27:43.500 --> 1:27:44.666
<i>-No. Stop.</i>
Sorry.

1:27:46.166 --> 1:27:48.333
<i>Did you and Alex</i>
<i>get some time after I left?</i>

1:27:48.416 --> 1:27:50.666
We did. Yeah, thank you.

1:27:50.750 --> 1:27:52.083
<i>Yeah? Oh, good.</i>

1:27:52.166 --> 1:27:55.291
<i>I think… You know, I think that you…</i>
<i>Like, both of you needed that.</i>

1:27:55.375 --> 1:27:56.291
Mm!

1:27:57.500 --> 1:27:59.333
<i>I'm glad I could help.</i>

1:28:01.458 --> 1:28:05.125
You… You know,
I'm about to go to work, and…

1:28:05.916 --> 1:28:10.625
Charlie, it bothers me so much
that you're not gonna be there.

1:28:11.166 --> 1:28:13.916
<i>I know. I know. I miss you too.</i>

1:28:15.875 --> 1:28:19.125
<i>You wanna go to the park or something?</i>
<i>With the girls?</i>

1:28:22.916 --> 1:28:24.375
Um…

1:28:26.750 --> 1:28:27.666
<i>Amy?</i>

1:28:29.208 --> 1:28:30.583
Uh, maybe lunch?

1:28:31.625 --> 1:28:32.875
<i>-Uh, yeah.</i>
Okay.

1:28:32.958 --> 1:28:35.500
<i>Lunch. Uh… Lunch works. When's good?</i>

1:28:36.500 --> 1:28:38.541
Uh, let me think

1:28:39.541 --> 1:28:40.791
for a moment.

1:28:40.875 --> 1:28:42.000
Um…

1:28:42.875 --> 1:28:43.958
Saturday?

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:47.625
<i>Uh… Yeah. Saturday works.</i>

1:28:48.208 --> 1:28:51.458
But I have to go to work now,
so I'll find a place.

1:28:51.541 --> 1:28:54.500
<i>-Just text me</i>
<i>-I</i>'ll… I'll… I'll send you the details.

1:28:55.375 --> 1:28:56.291
<i>-Okay.</i>
-Okay, bye.

1:28:56.375 --> 1:28:57.875
<i>-Say hi to Sandra for me.</i>
-Oh, I will.

1:28:57.958 --> 1:28:59.500
<i>-Okay. Bye.</i>
-Bye.

1:28:59.583 --> 1:29:02.083
<i> See you later. Bye-bye.</i>

1:29:07.583 --> 1:29:08.416
Great job.

1:29:09.041 --> 1:29:10.500
So you remember
what we talked about?

1:29:10.583 --> 1:29:12.750
The only way we can stop him
is if he admits to doing it,

1:29:12.833 --> 1:29:14.666
so we gotta get him to confess.

1:29:23.916 --> 1:29:26.125
<i>Oh fuck. Um…</i>

1:29:29.750 --> 1:29:31.250
Man, her pulse is racing.

1:29:37.416 --> 1:29:39.500
Okay, well,
I hope you guys can hear me.

1:29:45.333 --> 1:29:46.291
Right.

1:29:55.666 --> 1:29:57.083
Oh fuck.

1:29:58.958 --> 1:30:00.541
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1:30:07.916 --> 1:30:09.416
He's walking in right now.

1:30:13.833 --> 1:30:15.333
Hey!

1:30:16.041 --> 1:30:16.958
Hey.

1:30:17.041 --> 1:30:18.250
Hello.

1:30:18.333 --> 1:30:20.083
Hi. How's it going?

1:30:20.166 --> 1:30:21.333
Well, you know.

1:30:21.416 --> 1:30:22.666
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:30:22.750 --> 1:30:24.416
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:30:24.500 --> 1:30:25.833
I like this place.

1:30:29.958 --> 1:30:31.416
What's going on?

1:30:33.833 --> 1:30:35.458
Whew.

1:30:35.541 --> 1:30:37.416
So can I get you guys something to drink?

1:30:37.500 --> 1:30:40.125
-Uh, I'll get an iced tea, please.
-Iced tea.

1:30:40.708 --> 1:30:43.541
I will just have water. Thanks.

1:30:45.666 --> 1:30:46.750
What do you think?

1:30:48.458 --> 1:30:52.750
I'm starting a new job tonight.
Hoping these will make a good impression.

1:30:54.375 --> 1:30:56.208
-Where?
-Elmsworth.

1:30:56.291 --> 1:30:58.625
-You're starting at Elmsworth tonight?
-Yeah. Tonight, yeah.

1:30:58.708 --> 1:31:01.666
Got all my stuff in the car,
ready for a new start.

1:31:02.666 --> 1:31:04.958
That's… Wow, Charlie.

1:31:07.000 --> 1:31:08.166
You ready to order?

1:31:08.250 --> 1:31:12.333
Oh. Uh… You know, I'll get a…
I'll get a cheeseburger.

1:31:13.291 --> 1:31:15.166
-Me too.
-All right.

1:31:15.250 --> 1:31:16.958
-So…
-Two cheeseburgers, please!

1:31:17.041 --> 1:31:18.333
How are the girls?

1:31:18.416 --> 1:31:20.208
-Thank you.
-They're really good.

1:31:21.208 --> 1:31:22.416
How's the mayor?

1:31:22.500 --> 1:31:23.708
Yeah, she's great.

1:31:23.791 --> 1:31:24.958
Feeling better?

1:31:25.583 --> 1:31:26.583
Yeah.

1:31:28.583 --> 1:31:31.083
Work's been pretty awful
without you there.

1:31:31.166 --> 1:31:33.250
We were like partners.

1:31:33.750 --> 1:31:34.750
I know.

1:31:35.666 --> 1:31:37.375
And, like, the worst part is

1:31:37.458 --> 1:31:39.416
that everyone is just, you know,

1:31:40.208 --> 1:31:42.041
talking shit about you all the time.

1:31:43.416 --> 1:31:45.333
I guessed they would. Yeah.

1:31:45.416 --> 1:31:48.541
It makes me mad 'cause you're not there
to defend yourself, and so…

1:31:48.625 --> 1:31:52.458
You know, I'm going to town on everyone,
and Sandra, she--

1:31:52.541 --> 1:31:53.583
Oh God!

1:31:53.666 --> 1:31:55.333
-Oh, she got an earful.

1:31:55.416 --> 1:31:57.625
Now they'll be talking shit about me.

1:32:00.375 --> 1:32:02.791
I don't wanna talk about Parkfield. It's…

1:32:07.833 --> 1:32:08.708
Why not?

1:32:20.500 --> 1:32:21.541
Is it because

1:32:23.166 --> 1:32:24.916
what they're saying's true?

1:32:27.291 --> 1:32:28.416
'Cause, you know, um…

1:32:29.666 --> 1:32:32.041
I wouldn't care if you did those things.

1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:40.583
I mean, I could understand.

1:32:45.083 --> 1:32:47.500
-You could explain it--

1:33:27.541 --> 1:33:30.000
I didn't tell you.
I got permission to see my girls.

1:33:31.416 --> 1:33:33.750
Two days every second week.

1:33:34.666 --> 1:33:36.333
I was thinking…
I don't know, I was thinking

1:33:36.416 --> 1:33:39.625
that maybe you and Maya and Alex
and then me and my girls,

1:33:39.708 --> 1:33:41.625
we could go on a day trip or something.

1:33:49.416 --> 1:33:51.416
I wanna talk about Parkfield.

1:33:54.708 --> 1:33:56.666
I wanna talk about what you did.

1:34:22.416 --> 1:34:27.916
<i>♪ That love will sometimes bring</i>

1:34:30.583 --> 1:34:31.708
I gotta go.

1:34:32.666 --> 1:34:35.750
I'm starting a new job. Can't be late, so…

1:34:35.833 --> 1:34:37.291
But I'll call soon.

1:34:42.625 --> 1:34:45.916
He's leaving. You guys, he's leaving.
He's walking out right now.

1:34:46.666 --> 1:34:48.250
What…

1:35:05.458 --> 1:35:06.500
Are you okay?

1:35:08.750 --> 1:35:12.500
Where's Elmsworth?
Amy, where's Elmsworth Hospital?

1:35:15.291 --> 1:35:17.000
Thirty miles away in Pennsylvania.

1:35:19.541 --> 1:35:20.833
I'm gonna call Ellis.

1:35:21.666 --> 1:35:23.250
I pushed him too hard.

1:35:24.583 --> 1:35:26.250
You did great, Amy.

1:35:30.833 --> 1:35:33.666
We're good. They're gonna pick him up.

1:35:33.750 --> 1:35:35.500
-All right.
-Bring him in.

1:35:36.291 --> 1:35:38.833
We can only hold him for 48 hours.

1:36:07.875 --> 1:36:09.708
-And talk to the people.

1:36:09.791 --> 1:36:13.208
And I'm gonna make sure
there's something in my mind that…

1:36:50.375 --> 1:36:51.958
Show me your hands.

1:36:52.041 --> 1:36:53.166
Open the door.

1:36:54.083 --> 1:36:55.666
Slowly. Open the door.

1:37:00.333 --> 1:37:03.125
You're under arrest.
Get out of the vehicle. Slowly.

1:37:03.208 --> 1:37:04.500
Get down on the ground.

1:37:08.958 --> 1:37:10.625
Put this hand behind your back.

1:37:11.833 --> 1:37:16.291
Put this other hand behind your back.
Stay right there. Do not move.

1:38:03.875 --> 1:38:07.291
My name is Detective Sergeant Tim Braun.
With me is Detective Dan Baldwin.

1:38:07.375 --> 1:38:09.958
Today is Saturday, December 13, 2003.

1:38:10.041 --> 1:38:13.666
The time is approximately 8:14 p.m.

1:38:14.208 --> 1:38:16.958
We're in the Major Crimes interview room
with Mr. Charles Cullen.

1:38:17.041 --> 1:38:19.958
Mr. Cullen, for the record,
could you please state your full name?

1:38:20.625 --> 1:38:22.416
Uh, Charles Cullen.

1:38:23.250 --> 1:38:24.791
Could you spell that, please?

1:38:24.875 --> 1:38:27.958
Uh, C-H-A-R-L-E-S

1:38:28.041 --> 1:38:29.833
C-U-L-L-E-N.

1:38:29.916 --> 1:38:31.750
Is it okay if we call you Charlie, then?

1:38:32.583 --> 1:38:33.416
Yeah.

1:38:34.458 --> 1:38:35.541
Okay.

1:38:44.916 --> 1:38:46.250
Okay, Charlie.

1:38:50.333 --> 1:38:52.541
Is there anything
you wanna tell us, Charlie?

1:38:54.166 --> 1:38:55.708
Um…

1:38:59.250 --> 1:39:02.333
I mean, uh… I don't think so, no.

1:39:03.125 --> 1:39:07.333
How many IV bags have you polluted
at Parkfield Memorial Hospital?

1:39:14.916 --> 1:39:16.916
We know you killed Kelly Anderson.

1:39:18.166 --> 1:39:20.750
We know you killed Ana Martinez.
We know there's others.

1:39:22.708 --> 1:39:25.125
We just wanna talk about it
with you, Charlie.

1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:29.041
I can't. I'm not meant
to talk about patients

1:39:29.125 --> 1:39:30.833
without the hospital lawyers.

1:39:30.916 --> 1:39:33.541
You don't work there anymore.
You can say whatever you want.

1:39:33.625 --> 1:39:35.416
You're free to talk here.

1:39:36.500 --> 1:39:37.916
I can't, so…

1:39:39.666 --> 1:39:40.791
Why'd you kill 'em?

1:39:43.833 --> 1:39:46.041
Was it just women, Charlie?

1:39:47.708 --> 1:39:49.916
They remind you of your ex-wife maybe?

1:39:50.416 --> 1:39:52.416
You know, that I could understand.

1:39:55.041 --> 1:39:56.250
Or your mother?

1:40:04.250 --> 1:40:05.375
I can't.

1:40:06.458 --> 1:40:07.583
I can't.

1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.833
You know, the… the saline-bag stuff,

1:40:15.125 --> 1:40:17.000
that was… was pretty smart.

1:40:17.791 --> 1:40:19.791
That was very smart, Charlie.

1:40:21.875 --> 1:40:24.208
You know, I never seen anything like that.

1:40:24.791 --> 1:40:26.458
How'd you come up with that?

1:40:32.666 --> 1:40:34.708
How many have you killed,
Charlie?

1:40:36.625 --> 1:40:38.458
Ten, 11?

1:40:43.958 --> 1:40:46.000
Hey, Charlie, stick with me here, okay?

1:40:48.375 --> 1:40:50.208
Come on back, Charlie.

1:40:50.291 --> 1:40:53.166
Just gotta have this conversation, okay?
I know you can do it.

1:40:56.208 --> 1:40:57.666
I can't…

1:40:57.750 --> 1:41:00.000
Charlie, can you look at me, please?

1:41:00.625 --> 1:41:02.291
Mm… I can't.

1:41:02.375 --> 1:41:03.833
-Come on, Charlie.
-I can't.

1:41:04.333 --> 1:41:07.291
You can. You gotta do this.
I know you can.

1:41:09.458 --> 1:41:10.875
-Hey--

1:41:11.375 --> 1:41:12.958
I can't. I can't.

1:41:13.916 --> 1:41:16.208
I can't. I can't.

1:41:16.291 --> 1:41:18.333
I can't. I can't.

1:41:18.416 --> 1:41:19.416
-Charlie.

1:41:19.500 --> 1:41:21.250
-Charlie.
-I can't.

1:41:21.333 --> 1:41:22.750
-I can't.
-Charlie, you can.

1:41:23.583 --> 1:41:25.750
I can't, I can't, I can't.

1:41:25.833 --> 1:41:27.000
I can't, I can't.

1:41:27.083 --> 1:41:28.458
Charlie!

1:41:47.041 --> 1:41:47.958
All right.

1:41:49.291 --> 1:41:51.666
We've seen your Cerner,
we've seen your PYXIS,

1:41:51.750 --> 1:41:53.791
we've seen your orders,
we've seen the cancellations.

1:41:53.875 --> 1:41:55.041
We know all about it.

1:41:55.541 --> 1:41:58.458
We know how you poisoned the bags
in the storeroom,

1:41:58.541 --> 1:42:00.041
had the other nurses hang 'em up.

1:42:02.791 --> 1:42:05.458
You know what?
I don't think you picked Kelly, did you?

1:42:07.208 --> 1:42:08.500
Did you?

1:42:08.583 --> 1:42:10.916
You know
what I've been wondering?

1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.458
Now, I got no judgment. Charlie. Listen.

1:42:13.541 --> 1:42:14.875
-I can't.
-Hey.

1:42:14.958 --> 1:42:15.791
I can't.

1:42:15.875 --> 1:42:18.583
-You can, Charlie. Yes, you can.
-I can't.

1:42:19.333 --> 1:42:20.291
I can't.

1:42:21.041 --> 1:42:21.875
I can't.

1:42:21.958 --> 1:42:22.833
-Hey.
-I can't.

1:42:22.916 --> 1:42:23.791
-Hey.
-I can't.

1:42:23.875 --> 1:42:26.750
Hey, enough of this shit!
Enough of this shit, Charlie!

1:42:26.833 --> 1:42:29.333
I can't! I can't! I can't!

1:42:29.416 --> 1:42:32.125
I can't! I can't! I can't!

1:42:32.208 --> 1:42:35.500
I can't! I can't! I can't! I can't!

1:42:35.583 --> 1:42:38.250
I can't! I can't! I can't!

1:42:38.333 --> 1:42:41.666
I can't! I can't! I can't!

1:42:42.916 --> 1:42:44.791
I can't!

1:44:03.583 --> 1:44:04.833
-Hey.
-Hi.

1:44:07.250 --> 1:44:08.416
What happened?

1:44:08.500 --> 1:44:09.875
We're not gonna get it.

1:44:10.500 --> 1:44:12.791
He's not gonna break.
He's not gonna confess.

1:44:18.625 --> 1:44:20.708
We have to release him tomorrow morning.

1:44:29.250 --> 1:44:30.291
I'm sorry.

1:44:37.083 --> 1:44:40.541
<i>What's something a pet hamster</i>
<i>spends a lot of time doing?</i>

1:44:40.625 --> 1:44:43.333
<i>A pet hamster</i>
<i>spends a lot of time in the cage.</i>

1:44:44.250 --> 1:44:45.500
-<i>In the cage?</i>
-<i>Yes!</i>

1:44:48.458 --> 1:44:49.583
<i>In the cage!</i>

1:44:51.666 --> 1:44:52.958
<i>Oh no!</i>

1:45:39.666 --> 1:45:41.166
<i>You sure you're up for this?</i>

1:45:44.875 --> 1:45:45.791
Yeah.

1:45:47.291 --> 1:45:49.083
Remember, you can't touch him.

1:45:51.291 --> 1:45:53.041
You can't even get close to him.

1:45:57.333 --> 1:45:58.833
He was my friend.

1:46:00.791 --> 1:46:02.208
I just need to see him.

1:46:40.750 --> 1:46:41.791
Hi, Charlie.

1:46:46.083 --> 1:46:48.416
Can you take his handcuffs off please?

1:46:51.250 --> 1:46:52.291
Please?

1:47:32.750 --> 1:47:33.916
Are you okay?

1:47:41.041 --> 1:47:41.875
Um…

1:47:44.125 --> 1:47:45.333
Go away, Amy.

1:47:47.375 --> 1:47:48.250
You cold?

1:47:50.250 --> 1:47:51.833
Look, you're freezing. Here.

1:47:52.333 --> 1:47:54.416
I'm just gonna put this
over your shoulders.

1:48:09.916 --> 1:48:11.000
There you go.

1:48:14.958 --> 1:48:17.666
I really needed you
these few months, you know?

1:48:27.583 --> 1:48:28.916
And then all this.

1:48:34.500 --> 1:48:35.750
It made me…

1:48:38.666 --> 1:48:40.333
forget who you were to me.

1:48:44.333 --> 1:48:48.208
Forget what you did for me, and…

1:48:54.666 --> 1:48:56.583
I forgot about your goodness.

1:49:21.458 --> 1:49:23.125
I'll never understand.

1:49:26.166 --> 1:49:27.333
Not how you,

1:49:28.333 --> 1:49:32.500
who is so kind and generous…

1:49:35.041 --> 1:49:36.583
how you could hurt people.

1:49:42.125 --> 1:49:43.583
And I'm so sorry

1:49:45.208 --> 1:49:49.791
that I lied to you
and went behind your back.

1:49:52.250 --> 1:49:54.875
That must make you feel even more alone.

1:50:19.041 --> 1:50:21.083
Hey. Hey.

1:50:32.958 --> 1:50:34.500
All… You know, I never had…

1:50:34.583 --> 1:50:37.000
You know,
I always just wanted to help you.

1:50:38.083 --> 1:50:39.125
I know.

1:50:41.250 --> 1:50:42.375
I know that.

1:50:46.750 --> 1:50:48.458
And I still need you.

1:51:00.291 --> 1:51:01.833
What do you need me to do?

1:51:07.666 --> 1:51:08.958
Tell the truth.

1:51:23.125 --> 1:51:24.375
I just did it.

1:51:35.041 --> 1:51:36.166
I just did it.

1:51:48.250 --> 1:51:51.291
I'm sorry. I'm gonna need more than that.

1:51:54.708 --> 1:51:56.208
What do you want me to tell you?

1:52:00.375 --> 1:52:01.375
Names.

1:52:02.333 --> 1:52:04.000
I can't remember all the names.

1:52:05.958 --> 1:52:07.916
Just tell me what you can remember.

1:52:15.791 --> 1:52:17.416
Douglas Stevenson.

1:52:24.333 --> 1:52:26.083
Ana Martinez.

1:52:29.125 --> 1:52:30.541
Kelly Anderson.

1:52:34.625 --> 1:52:36.208
And there… there was…

1:52:37.666 --> 1:52:38.583
Uh…

1:52:39.166 --> 1:52:42.333
I can't remember his name.
He was younger. Um…

1:52:43.666 --> 1:52:45.333
-Jack Ivins?
-Yeah. Jack.

1:52:47.041 --> 1:52:48.083
Jack. Yep.

1:52:49.041 --> 1:52:50.833
And then there… there was a…

1:52:51.833 --> 1:52:54.333
There was a… a man at my last hospital,

1:52:54.416 --> 1:52:56.875
uh, he had a German name. I can't…

1:53:02.291 --> 1:53:03.291
Why?

1:53:14.791 --> 1:53:16.291
They didn't stop me.

1:55:25.583 --> 1:55:26.666
Mm.

1:55:30.708 --> 1:55:31.833
Mm.

1:55:35.666 --> 1:55:38.375
We have to get up.
It's a school day.

1:55:41.625 --> 1:55:42.875
Not today.

1:55:45.041 --> 1:55:46.750
Today we stay in bed.
