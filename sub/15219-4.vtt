Feisty little wench,

30:13.812 --> 30:18.044
You. So we can talk,
and I won't look like a lunatic.
Where have you been?

30:18.116 --> 30:20.346
I've been with Beeks.

30:20.418 --> 30:23.182
She says I'm gonna need
five years of analysis...

30:23.254 --> 30:27.350
before I'll be able to deal
with you as a-- a woman.

30:27.425 --> 30:30.360
I'm not a woman!

30:30.428 --> 30:33.420

keep telling myself.

<i>Al, I'm ruining</i>
<i>Samantha's life.</i>

from committing suicide.

30:49.981 --> 30:53.781
- Which is?
- Tonight.

30:55.820 --> 30:58.721
I didn't really think that talking
to a woman after all these years...

30:58.790 --> 31:01.588
would be so easy,
so comfortable.

31:01.659 --> 31:05.595
Some of it has to do
with being lucky enough to find
a woman with your sensitivity.

31:05.663 --> 31:09.622
<i>I wasn't going to go out</i>
<i>on this date. Ever since Edith</i>
<i>asked me to move out,</i>

<i>Tonight I don't</i>
<i>feel angry at all.</i>

for a moment?
Sure.

- No.

I just wanted you to tell you
that I know how difficult...

32:01.452 --> 32:03.579
it's going to be
going through the divorce.

32:03.655 --> 32:07.455
And I'm going to do everything I can
to make it easier on the children.

an arrangement.

Now, whatever lies my husband
has obviously told you,

32:31.516 --> 32:33.677
he will never divorce me.

32:33.751 --> 32:36.447
Buddy is far too egotistical
to give up the status...

32:36.521 --> 32:39.422
he acquired
when he married me.

32:39.490 --> 32:44.450
And if he ever tries,
I will strip him to his shorts.

She excused herself and went
to this table in the next room.

- I can't. You're my friend.
- Then let me do this.
It's my choice.

- Neither is living.

- I love him, Sam.

I still love him.

No way.
Not with this body.

45:40.137 --> 45:42.196
Bodies can be deceiving.

45:44.274 --> 45:47.004
You can't be a man!

45:47.077 --> 45:49.477
Why, because I
turn you on?

45:49.546 --> 45:53.482
W-- Yeah.
Um, ah--

45:53.550 --> 45:56.110
I-I-I mean, no!

45:56.186 --> 45:59.678
No. Oh, no!
I-- I, uh--

45:59.757 --> 46:03.022
You, you were a, uh--
You mean you had a--

46:03.093 --> 46:06.028
Y-You did
a ChristineJorgensen?

46:06.096 --> 46:08.587
No, no. I didn't say
I used to be a man.

46:08.665 --> 46:12.567
I said...
I <i>am</i> a man.

46:12.636 --> 46:15.298
And I'll prove it to you.

46:15.372 --> 46:18.500
No!

46:18.575 --> 46:24.445
If you look closely,
you'll notice that
I walk like a man.

46:24.515 --> 46:26.483
I stand like a man.

46:26.550 --> 46:28.814
<i>And I know things</i>
<i>that only a man can know.</i>

46:28.886 --> 46:31.446
Like what it feels like
to get kicked in the crotch,

46:31.522 --> 46:34.286
how the pain just keeps
growing and growing.

46:34.358 --> 46:37.452
And then that
wonderful sensation when
it finally subsides.

46:37.528 --> 46:41.396
<i>Or what it's like to walk</i>
<i>around high school</i>
<i>with your books in front of you...</i>

46:41.465 --> 46:45.492
to cover up
an embarrassing case
of pubescent hormonal overload.

46:45.569 --> 46:47.730
You had a brother?

46:47.805 --> 46:51.241
Does a brother tell his sister
what he did looking
at his first centerfold?

46:54.077 --> 46:56.511
No, you stay away from me.

46:56.580 --> 46:58.514
I thought I turned you on.

47:00.083 --> 47:03.575
I don't have time
for this stupid game.

47:03.654 --> 47:07.351
Speaking of games,
why don't I show you
how I throw a baseball.

47:12.763 --> 47:16.164
Or better yet,
how I throw a punch.

47:29.112 --> 47:34.209
Not yet. Not yet.
[ Sighing ]

47:36.253 --> 47:39.689
[ Sighing ]
I'm ready to leap now.

47:48.198 --> 47:50.132
(music) [ Holds Note ]

47:50.200 --> 47:52.794
<i>[ Applause ]</i>

47:56.840 --> 47:58.774
Oh, boy.
