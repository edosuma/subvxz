WEBVTT

00:03.800 --> 00:05.480
Lads! One-two!

00:05.480 --> 00:07.960
So, like, I've had a think
of how I can bury me face,

00:07.960 --> 00:09.960
in your ma's arse,
but we still move on together

00:09.960 --> 00:12.160
with our relationship.
Lad, it's too early for this.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.960
No, exposure therapy
to overcome your fears.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.960
I'll come round for tea
and I'll sit opposite you,

00:17.960 --> 00:20.000
then I'll eat some tea,
then put my face in your ma's arse,

00:20.000 --> 00:22.640
eat tea, face in arse,
eat tea, face in arse.

00:22.640 --> 00:24.960
I'm gonna record you saying this
one day and send it to her.

00:24.960 --> 00:25.960
You'd shit yourself.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.960
Do it!
Be good to float the idea to her.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.960
Seriously, though, how long
would you be pissed off at me for?

00:31.960 --> 00:34.960
Or does it depend
how long I'm in there for?

00:34.960 --> 00:37.960
I suppose if you had your head in me
ma's arse for like a week straight,

00:37.960 --> 00:39.800
I'd be more pissed off, like, yeah.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.000
Lad, I'd eat a chicken dipper
out your ma's arse.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.960
Honestly, I would, cos if your ma
said to me, "Come round for tea.

00:46.960 --> 00:49.960
"You can have these chicken dippers,
only if you eat them out me arse",

00:49.960 --> 00:53.960
I'd not only do it,
I'd prefer it served that way.

00:53.960 --> 00:55.960
SCOFFS

01:01.960 --> 01:04.960
Ah, there youse are, lads.
All right, boys.

01:04.960 --> 01:06.960
Can I ask youse two something?

01:06.960 --> 01:09.960
Right, when a lad
goes out with a girl to dinner,

01:09.960 --> 01:10.960
he usually pays, right?

01:10.960 --> 01:15.960
So when you two go out, who pays,
because youse are both lads?

01:15.960 --> 01:17.960
Should I tell him?

01:17.960 --> 01:19.000
Yeah. Go on, it's time.

01:20.960 --> 01:23.160
Connor, every time we go out,

01:23.160 --> 01:26.960
we each take in turns
to wear a bra under our shirt.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.960
That's how we know who's paying.
Mm-hmm.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.960
GASPS
I didn't know that.

01:30.960 --> 01:32.960
Eh, Thomas!

01:32.960 --> 01:35.960
I've got an idea for an app
that is gonna shit all over yours.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.960
It's called ScrApp.

01:37.960 --> 01:42.960
For like-minded people
who wanna meet up for a daily scrap.

01:42.960 --> 01:46.960
Lewis Connolly, soon to be the face
of Universal Credit,

01:46.960 --> 01:49.960
treats women like they're shit
and says,

01:49.960 --> 01:51.960
"I'm not racist, me, lads,

01:51.960 --> 01:54.960
"cos I got three DVDs
of that Morgan Freeman fella."

01:54.960 --> 01:59.960
Keep chatting wham, lad, with
your little astrology dating app.

01:59.960 --> 02:03.960
All that Mars and Venus shite, lad,
it's a load of bollocks.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.960
It's a shame that you think that,

02:05.960 --> 02:08.960
cos I saw Aimee's profile on there
last night, and you two...

02:08.960 --> 02:10.960
you're perfectly matched.

02:10.960 --> 02:12.000
Really, lad?

02:12.000 --> 02:15.320
No! Because even Mars and Venus
know that you're a piece of shit

02:15.320 --> 02:17.320
Aimee's far too good for!

02:17.320 --> 02:19.960
LAUGHTER
Oh, you've been told there, lad.

02:19.960 --> 02:21.960
You whopper!

02:21.960 --> 02:24.960
Tom is well funny, you know?

02:24.960 --> 02:27.960
OK, lad?
Get off!

02:27.960 --> 02:29.960
Cor, I'm raging with Ziad!
Why?

02:29.960 --> 02:31.960
Do you know the special thing
he had planned

02:31.960 --> 02:34.160
was a scrapbook of our
first weeks together with, like,

02:34.160 --> 02:36.000
photies and tickets
from stuff we did.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
That sounds amazing.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.960
Well, no, it's not,
cos there was a photie missing -

02:40.960 --> 02:42.960
the one of us shagging!

02:42.960 --> 02:44.960
Still, it's really thoughtful,
though, innit?

02:44.960 --> 02:46.160
It's not THAT thoughtful, girl!

02:46.160 --> 02:48.960
I mean, I've got the photies on me
phone, I don't need them in a book.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.960
And he chose
all the worst ones of us.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.960
And the tickets?
I mean, I can't even use 'em again,

02:52.960 --> 02:54.960
so what's the point in that?!

02:54.960 --> 02:56.960
You didn't say this to him, did you?
Nah.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.960
I just pretended it was cute,
but like, all I was thinking

02:58.960 --> 03:01.960
was why doesn't he wanna have sex
with me? Like...

03:02.960 --> 03:05.960
...what if... he doesn't find me fit?

03:09.160 --> 03:11.320
Can't be that.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.960
Argh! What is Rory slide tackling
in the playground for?

03:15.960 --> 03:18.960
Move! Could've ended me career!

03:18.960 --> 03:20.960
Let it go, lad,
it was a good challenge.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.960
What d'you mean?
Nah, nah, nah. Next time I see him,

03:22.960 --> 03:24.960
I'm gonna kill him!

03:24.960 --> 03:27.960
With... with forgiveness.

03:27.960 --> 03:31.960
Cos Islam teaches us
the art of forgiveness

03:31.960 --> 03:32.960
to all that have wronged us.

03:32.960 --> 03:35.960
Oh... Ella Grace.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.960
I am honoured
that you trusted me with this, Mo.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.160
I know it means so much to you.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.800
And thank you
for facilitating my growth.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.000
Abdullah.

03:51.960 --> 03:52.960
Ah...

03:52.960 --> 03:54.320
CHUCKLING

03:54.320 --> 03:56.960
Are you still pretending
to be religious? Shh!

03:56.960 --> 03:58.960
You haven't got a chance
with her, mate!

03:58.960 --> 04:01.960
What's next, lad? Taking her
to the promised land, are you?

04:01.960 --> 04:02.960
Pilgrimage to Mecca? Eh?

04:02.960 --> 04:05.640
You never know, you might get
to hold her hand, then, Mo.

04:05.640 --> 04:06.960
Mm-mm-mm...
Had you all whipped.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.960
MESSAGE ALERT
Shut up, lad!

04:10.960 --> 04:13.960
♪ Will we ever be
Like the way we used to be

04:13.960 --> 04:16.960
♪ Or have we lost ourselves?

04:16.960 --> 04:18.960
♪ Thought I knew you... ♪

04:18.960 --> 04:21.480
Oh! Glad I bumped into you.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.960
Um, yesterday
at Romeo And Juliet rehearsals

04:23.960 --> 04:25.960
during the romantic scene,

04:25.960 --> 04:28.480
I kind of felt like
you got a bit TOO into it.

04:28.480 --> 04:29.960
Try to remember...

04:29.960 --> 04:31.640
..we're acting.

04:31.640 --> 04:34.960
Sorry, you're right,
but our faces get so close

04:34.960 --> 04:38.160
and that gigantic spot you had
on your nose was just too seducing.

04:38.160 --> 04:40.960
To be fair,
same here with your Scouse accent

04:40.960 --> 04:42.800
butchering Shakespeare.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.000
Ooh, it's just too alluring.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.960
Only one thing to do, then.
Ella Grace?

04:48.960 --> 04:52.960
Christopher and I are having trouble
navigating our creative relationship

04:52.960 --> 04:55.960
during rehearsals
due to some of the intimate content.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.640
Do you think you could
help guide us through our issues?

04:58.640 --> 04:59.960
I...
Yes.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.960
We want to reach a point
where a structure is in place

05:02.960 --> 05:04.960
that allows us to unleash
our best performance

05:04.960 --> 05:07.000
in an environment
that feels safe and comfortable.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.000
WHIMPERS

05:10.000 --> 05:11.960
Are you all right?

05:11.960 --> 05:13.480
Ooh. It's just so inspiring

05:13.480 --> 05:15.480
that you're collectively
thinking about this.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.960
Guys, sorry, I mean folks,

05:17.960 --> 05:22.160
I will be your intimacy coordinator.
Mm-hmm. Mm.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.000
LAUGHTER

05:26.000 --> 05:28.960
Oh, my God, she believed us!

05:28.960 --> 05:31.000
See you later.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.960
Oh!

05:32.960 --> 05:33.960
I'm back with a bang, lad!

05:33.960 --> 05:38.160
The bang being the kid I dropped
on me way in with a lazy jab.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.960
I heard Meachy
got about 20 emails saying,

05:40.960 --> 05:42.160
"Announce Lewis's return, lad."

05:42.160 --> 05:44.480
Were they all from Kieron?
Maybe.

05:44.480 --> 05:47.160
But listen, I had some time
to do some real soul searching

05:47.160 --> 05:49.960
when I was away. And I realised...

05:50.960 --> 05:52.960
...my soul's a natural born lunatic,

05:52.960 --> 05:56.960
so I found your Insta,
got a pic of your fat sponge 'ead

05:56.960 --> 05:58.960
and put it on me dart board.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.160
Why am I in black and white?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.800
Printer's out of colour,
wasn't an artistic choice!

06:02.800 --> 06:04.960
Shouldn't there be a dart in it?
I lost me darts, lad!

06:04.960 --> 06:06.960
EXHALES CALMLY

06:06.960 --> 06:10.960
The point is, stay away from her,
or I'll cripple you.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.960
I wonder what the surprise is?

06:19.960 --> 06:21.960
Maybe he's taking you
in a private jet

06:21.960 --> 06:23.960
to a posh restaurant in Paris!
Nah!

06:23.960 --> 06:26.960
I reckon he's bought you LFC!

06:26.960 --> 06:29.800
Put me on the wing,
I'm a whippet, lad!

06:29.800 --> 06:33.800
Oh. My. God! It gets even better!

06:33.800 --> 06:35.960
THEY ALL EXCLAIM

06:35.960 --> 06:37.960
That's a '23 plate.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.960
Imagine if we had a car.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.960
The birds would be all over us.
We could drive them into town!

06:42.960 --> 06:44.960
We could take the birds
to t'pictures!

06:44.960 --> 06:46.480
We could go Maccies drive thru!

06:47.960 --> 06:49.800
With the birds, obviously.

06:49.800 --> 06:52.960
You're a lucky bastard, you, Ted!
I wanna Thomas!

06:52.960 --> 06:53.960
Go 'ead, Ted!

06:53.960 --> 06:55.960
He's so lucky, you know?

07:00.960 --> 07:03.960
I didn't even know these were here.
What are they?

07:03.960 --> 07:06.800
One hundred human figures.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.800
Me grandad would take me here
sometimes when I was a kid.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.960
He believed that
the statues represent life,

07:13.960 --> 07:15.960
and the sea is death.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.960
That's why each figure
stands further out towards the sea,

07:18.960 --> 07:21.640
as we're all at different stages
of our life.

07:21.640 --> 07:25.960
And that's why in between,
we have to be bold, take chances,

07:25.960 --> 07:28.960
because one day,
you will be the last statue.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.960
And you don't wanna look back
at your past selves and think,

07:30.960 --> 07:32.960
"I wasn't brave enough,
or bold enough."

07:36.640 --> 07:38.960
And now, I come here on me own.

07:38.960 --> 07:41.320
As me grandad
DID become the last statue.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.800
TUTS

07:42.800 --> 07:44.960
He slowly faded away.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.960
Just like the image I have of him
in me 'ead.

07:48.960 --> 07:51.960
But you know what didn't fade away?

07:51.960 --> 07:55.960
What he taught me.
That's why I did my app!

07:55.960 --> 07:58.960
Because I've always believed
in astrology

07:58.960 --> 08:01.640
and how there's a soulmate out there
for all of us.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.000
Do you believe in soulmates?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.960
Yes! Don't you?

08:06.960 --> 08:09.960
There HAS to be a reason
this universe exists. Just look!

08:09.960 --> 08:14.000
It's just too deliberate,
too beautifully orchestrated.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.960
Maybe... it's to experience love.

08:19.960 --> 08:22.800
It's amazing you got all them
inspirations from these statues.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.960
I just interpreted them as

08:23.960 --> 08:26.960
"normalise getting your arse out
at the beach".

08:26.960 --> 08:30.960
THEY CHUCKLE
Ted, I love your sense of humour.

08:31.960 --> 08:35.320
But don't use it as an escape
just because you're feeling anxious.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.960
Be present, Ted.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.960
CHUCKLING

08:51.960 --> 08:56.960
As-salamu alaikum wa
Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.960
Al-hamdu lillahi rabbil 'alamin.
CRUNCHING

09:01.640 --> 09:02.960
Want one, lad?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.960
No, thanks.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.960
Can you please let me do my dua?

09:07.960 --> 09:11.960
Sorry. Sorry, yeah. Go 'ead.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.960
As-salamu alaikum wa
Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.960
As-salamu alaikum wa Rahmatullahi
wa Barakatuhu. Al-hamdu lillah...

09:17.960 --> 09:18.960
CRUNCHING

09:18.960 --> 09:21.960
So how's it going with Mia-Louise?
It's fine.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.960
I bet you're getting it
every night, lad.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.960
You know, it's none
of your business, actually.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.960
Oh, my God.
That means you're getting nothing!

09:28.960 --> 09:31.960
Sorry, do you not realise
how disrespectful you're being

09:31.960 --> 09:33.960
right now?
Yeah. Sorry, sorry.

09:35.480 --> 09:37.960
Can you not get it up, or something?
What?

09:37.960 --> 09:39.960
You know...
No.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.640
Oh.
I want to wait until marriage.

09:42.640 --> 09:45.960
Are you MAD?
I must be.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.000
Look, I want to, so much,
but I care about my religion,

09:49.000 --> 09:50.960
and I want to be
dedicated to my faith.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.320
But she is proper fit.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.480
You think I don't know that? I have
the exact same desires as you,

09:56.480 --> 09:58.960
Mohammed, OK? Sometimes I think
I'm doing the wrong thing.

09:58.960 --> 10:01.480
Like, what if she thinks
I'm a crazy religious person

10:01.480 --> 10:03.960
and she wants to end
the relationship?

10:03.960 --> 10:06.800
I get it. I wish The Brimble
was more like Mia-Louise.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.800
I'm getting nothing.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.960
You know, she's actually
probably the type of girl

10:11.960 --> 10:14.960
that appreciates the mental strength
it takes to abstain

10:14.960 --> 10:16.960
and overcome the needs of the body.

10:16.960 --> 10:18.960
You reckon?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.960
GASPING

10:22.960 --> 10:24.960
Come 'ead.

10:24.960 --> 10:29.960
BOTH RECITE IN ARABIC

10:29.960 --> 10:30.960
Do you mind if I join?

10:30.960 --> 10:33.960
It would be an honour
to strengthen my connection

10:33.960 --> 10:36.800
to your beautiful faith.
Yeah, course.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.960
Here, move.

10:38.960 --> 10:42.960
Am I OK to repeat what you guys say?

10:42.960 --> 10:47.320
Yes! Of course.
Actually, it's a great idea. Yes.

10:47.320 --> 10:49.480
But in Islam, a man and woman
cannot pray together,

10:49.480 --> 10:51.960
but that's OK. It's OK.
I will teach you something,

10:51.960 --> 10:54.960
and you repeat after me. OK?
You ready?

10:54.960 --> 10:57.960
SPEAKS IN ARABIC

11:02.960 --> 11:07.960
Wow. Bravo. Well, like, you're
amazing. We will say it together?

11:07.960 --> 11:08.960
Lad.
Yeah! Come on.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.480
We're like family here, yes?
You know, it's OK.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.960
Yeah. Family.
One, two, three...

11:17.960 --> 11:21.800
Wow. Well, very good.
You are a natural, you know?

11:22.960 --> 11:25.960
Ted, come on.
Isn't it a bit soon for us

11:25.960 --> 11:28.960
to be going to some
five-star spa resort together?

11:28.960 --> 11:30.960
Ah... shut up.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.480
I wanted to bring you here,

11:32.480 --> 11:34.960
because like you said
the beach shaped you,

11:34.960 --> 11:35.960
round here shaped me.

11:36.960 --> 11:40.480
I decided from a young age that I
wasn't gonna let any little knob 'ed

11:40.480 --> 11:43.960
from round here
not let me be who I wanted to be.

11:43.960 --> 11:47.480
Ask Liam Hughes. He kicked off,
thinkin' I was a soft touch.

11:47.480 --> 11:52.960
What kind of violent,
Neanderthal thug am I seeing?

11:52.960 --> 11:53.960
Ah, don't worry.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.960
There weren't any lasting effects
from the beating I gave Liam.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.000
All right, Liam!

11:59.960 --> 12:03.960
Oh, my God, I'm joking!
That's Smigger!

12:03.960 --> 12:05.960
Oh... Such a wind-up!

12:05.960 --> 12:08.960
All right, Smig? They're hopeful
you'll be outta that in a year!

12:10.960 --> 12:13.960
Another one that got cheeky, though.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.960
Oh, my God, I'm joking!

12:14.960 --> 12:16.480
CHUCKLING

12:17.640 --> 12:20.960
No, to be honest, Thomas,
I have to be in control.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.960
I don't let anyone in me head,
but...

12:23.960 --> 12:26.960
you have... a little bit.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.640
Right scary,
but it's exciting as well.

12:31.640 --> 12:35.960
Exactly. What's the point
of being in control all the time?

12:35.960 --> 12:37.960
It's so boring.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.960
Not being in control...

12:40.960 --> 12:44.800
...that's where the beautiful chaos
happens.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.960
GASPS

12:47.960 --> 12:50.800
What you doing?!
Have a little spin.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.960
Don't mind us!
Chaos coming through!

12:52.960 --> 12:55.960
♪ This place is where I'm from

12:55.960 --> 12:59.960
♪ Familiar faces
And the accent's like a song... ♪

13:05.480 --> 13:07.960
LAUGHING LOUDLY

13:07.960 --> 13:10.960
Why is he laughing so much?

13:10.960 --> 13:12.960
It's a bit flirty, that, innit?

13:12.960 --> 13:15.960
Read the top one.
"I'm going down the hozzy, me lad."

13:15.960 --> 13:19.320
That means you're going to
the hospital. The hospital?

13:19.320 --> 13:21.960
I'm still learning.
OK. One more, one more. OK.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.960
"An absolute belter of a lad."
LAUGHTER

13:24.960 --> 13:25.960
Ah, I say good?

13:25.960 --> 13:28.960
Oh, my God!
Why is he taking Thomas's phone?

13:28.960 --> 13:30.160
Is he giving him his number?

13:30.160 --> 13:33.960
This means to, like,
avoid someone or something.

13:33.960 --> 13:34.960
OK.
OK?

13:34.960 --> 13:36.960
All right. Ready?
Ready, OK. Go!

13:36.960 --> 13:38.640
"I'm swerving my bird tonight".

13:38.640 --> 13:39.960
SHE GASPS

13:39.960 --> 13:44.960
Did you just hear that?
He's swerving me tonight for Thomas!

13:44.960 --> 13:47.960
Aims, it all makes sense why
he doesn't wanna have sex with me.

13:47.960 --> 13:50.000
My Ziad's one of those
proper fit gays.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.960
He's not gay.

13:52.960 --> 13:56.320
A healthy, consent-driven
environment is paramount

13:56.320 --> 13:59.640
to ensuring actors
reach their creative potential.

13:59.640 --> 14:03.960
Actors are storytellers,
but I am also a storyteller.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.640
And my story ends
with established boundaries.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.960
See, that's my concern.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.960
I don't wanna overstep
any boundaries.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.320
Like, am I allowed to hug him?

14:14.320 --> 14:17.960
If you both feel comfortable
with that, and, more importantly,

14:17.960 --> 14:19.960
you communicate that to each other.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.960
So, during the hug, can I have
a slight squeeze of her arse

14:22.960 --> 14:24.960
if I feel it suits the character?

14:27.960 --> 14:29.320
How would you feel about that,
Aimee?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.960
Comfortable.

14:30.960 --> 14:32.960
Well, then, you've established
a secure space

14:32.960 --> 14:33.960
which allows that to happen.

14:33.960 --> 14:40.960
So, if we both feel comfortable
with me tickling his balls,

14:40.960 --> 14:41.960
can we do it?

14:41.960 --> 14:45.960
Ooh, erm...
If you've established boundaries

14:45.960 --> 14:48.960
and the ball tickling falls
within those boundaries, then yeah.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.800
So as long as
we're both comfortable,

14:50.800 --> 14:52.960
we can really do all of that,
even if it's not in the script?

14:52.960 --> 14:54.960
Yeah, as long as it...

14:54.960 --> 14:55.960
So, I could wank him off?

14:55.960 --> 14:57.960
Then I could finish on her tits?

14:57.960 --> 15:00.960
I could wear a strap-on
and peg his arsehole on stage?

15:00.960 --> 15:03.960
Well, yeah...
Look, let's leave it there.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.960
Sometimes it's better to take

15:05.960 --> 15:09.320
a step back from communication
to um, reflect.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.160
THEY LAUGH

15:14.960 --> 15:16.800
See you later.
Oh!

15:18.320 --> 15:22.960
Put some respect on me name, lad!
I told you to stay away from her.

15:22.960 --> 15:26.960
I can't. We're acting together.
She's Juliet, I'm Romeo.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.960
Then do the scenes separately
on a green screen

15:28.960 --> 15:30.960
and edit it together
in post-production!

15:30.960 --> 15:33.320
This is a play, not a movie.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.480
Always with the smart arse answers, lad.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.960
You've left me no choice.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.960
There's a storm comin' for Aimee.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.960
MIMICS STORMY WIND

15:42.960 --> 15:45.960
Stay indoors, lad!

15:45.960 --> 15:49.960
You don't wanna
get caught in Storm Lewis.

15:49.960 --> 15:50.960
HE LAUGHS NASTILY

15:50.960 --> 15:53.960
Unless I tell you to come out,
cos I'm gonna smash your head in.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.480
Sorry I didn't reply
to your text before.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.960
Do you wanna come over
to mine instead, though?

16:57.960 --> 17:00.960
I've got a free house,
so we're alone then.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.960
I've got homework to sort out.

17:02.960 --> 17:05.960
Well, just come after your homework.
I've been missing you today.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.960
I heard you in the toilets.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.960
Are you following me?

17:12.960 --> 17:14.960
No. I was in the cubicle
next to you,

17:14.960 --> 17:17.960
but I probably would have heard you
from the fucking gym!

17:17.960 --> 17:22.640
Why are you getting angry, Ted?
You're embarrassing yourself.

17:22.640 --> 17:24.960
Yeah, but I thought...
Yeah, but thought... what?

17:24.960 --> 17:26.960
You thought that I like you?

17:26.960 --> 17:29.960
I do, I really like you,
and I wanna see where this goes,

17:29.960 --> 17:31.960
but at the same time,
I don't wanna be tied down.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.960
I'm exploring ethical non-monogamy.

17:33.960 --> 17:35.960
I thought you believed in soulmates.

17:35.960 --> 17:38.480
I do. One day, but right now...

17:38.480 --> 17:40.960
I just wanna have fun, Ted.

17:40.960 --> 17:43.960
What do you mean by that?

17:43.960 --> 17:49.800
Look, I understand that this is
your first relationship,

17:49.800 --> 17:53.800
but you need to let me know
if you can handle this.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.960
Mia-Louise! Mia-Louise!

18:03.960 --> 18:05.960
Please, please, please...

18:05.960 --> 18:06.960
Why didn't you reply to me
last night?

18:06.960 --> 18:10.960
Cos Ziad, I know why you don't wanna
have sex with me.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.960
OK, look, I'm sorry.
I was going to tell you.

18:14.960 --> 18:15.960
I thought it would change things.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.800
It's a game changer, Ziad.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.960
Maybe if we get married,
things will be different.

18:20.960 --> 18:21.960
That's not how marriage works.

18:21.960 --> 18:23.960
So, you don't want to be with me
any more?

18:23.960 --> 18:25.320
Well, do you wanna be with me?

18:25.320 --> 18:28.960
Of course I do! Look, it's just sex.
It doesn't change our connection.

18:28.960 --> 18:31.160
Wait, so we're together,

18:31.160 --> 18:33.960
but then you just leave
to go and do that sometimes?

18:33.960 --> 18:35.960
Leave?

18:35.960 --> 18:38.960
You wanna do it in front of me?
Do what in front of you?

18:38.960 --> 18:40.960
Shag guys!

18:40.960 --> 18:42.960
Cos you're into fellas!

18:42.960 --> 18:44.960
No, I'm not.

18:44.960 --> 18:47.960
Then why don't you wanna have sex
with me?

18:47.960 --> 18:49.960
Because I...
Cos what?

18:50.960 --> 18:53.960
Because I want to wait
until marriage.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.960
Oh! Oh, my God.
Well, thank God for that!

18:56.960 --> 18:59.960
OK, so you don't think
I'm a crazy religious person?

18:59.960 --> 19:02.960
Nah, nah. I'm just made up
you're not into fellas.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.960
OK, good, because... Mia-Louise,
I want to go on a journey with you

19:05.960 --> 19:07.960
that elevates above the physical,

19:07.960 --> 19:10.800
that explores meanings that are
deeper and more everlasting,

19:10.800 --> 19:13.960
that can bind us together
as one eternal soul.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.960
HE MUTTERS

19:17.960 --> 19:19.960
And we can do some fingering.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.160
No, I can't do any sexual activity,
Mia-Louise.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.960
What about, like, oral stuff?
No. I can't do anything.

19:24.960 --> 19:25.960

19:34.480 --> 19:36.960
I've never seen you cry before, lad.

19:36.960 --> 19:38.960
TED SNIFFS

19:38.960 --> 19:40.960
Thomas just dump you?

19:40.960 --> 19:43.960
Oh... I called it, you know?

19:43.960 --> 19:47.480
I said to the others,
he's way outta your league.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.320
He didn't dump me.

19:49.320 --> 19:50.960
Then what's up?

19:50.960 --> 19:54.960
He wants to see me,
but see other people, too.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.960
Isn't that what all gays do?

19:56.960 --> 19:57.960
No.

19:57.960 --> 19:59.960
Well, not everyone.

20:00.960 --> 20:02.960
I'm not sure that's what I want.

20:02.960 --> 20:07.480
I understand, lad.
I'm onto something similar meself.

20:07.480 --> 20:08.960
What d'you mean?

20:08.960 --> 20:09.960
Reece's ma.

20:11.960 --> 20:15.960
I have these special moments
with her when I go round for tea.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.960
I tell her that her corn beef hash
is stunning,

20:18.960 --> 20:20.960
then she gives me that smile.
Hm!

20:22.960 --> 20:26.960
Then I have to leave,
and it kills me,

20:26.960 --> 20:30.960
cos I wanna see that smile
every second of every day.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.960
And then the questions
I'm left wrestling with are...

20:33.960 --> 20:37.960
"Am I OK with just living off
these special moments?"

20:37.960 --> 20:39.960
"Am I OK with not being all in?"

20:41.480 --> 20:42.960

Oh. That was short.

21:07.960 --> 21:11.960
Yeah. This Islamic meditation's
a very quick one.

21:11.960 --> 21:18.960
I mainly use it to strengthen me
mind to help with fasting, you know?

21:18.960 --> 21:20.960
And me abstinence from sex.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.000
You abstain from sex?
Yeah.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.960
Until marriage.

21:24.960 --> 21:28.960
It's easy to give in
to basic physical needs,

21:28.960 --> 21:30.960
but my brain's different.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.960
It needs to be
constantly challenged.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.960
You must be so mentally strong, Mo.

21:36.960 --> 21:41.480
Yeah. With great power
comes great responsibility.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.960
I feel embarrassed.

21:45.960 --> 21:48.320
What? No, no, no,
don't be embarrassed.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.960
You can tell me
how you feel about me.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.960
I feel embarrassed because I've been
waiting for you to make a move

21:52.960 --> 21:55.960
and that was never gonna happen,
which obviously I respect.

21:55.960 --> 21:58.000
Waiting for ME to make a move?

21:58.000 --> 22:00.960
You have changed me
so much spiritually, Mo,

22:00.960 --> 22:05.960
and I've grown to really like you,
but I am a very sexual person,

22:05.960 --> 22:07.960
who needs her mind and body
stimulated equally.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.960
But, Grace, er...

22:09.960 --> 22:11.960
I've been meaning to tell you this,
but...

22:13.640 --> 22:15.960
...I'm not actually
a practising Muslim.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.960
Mo, don't change yourself for me.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.800
I respect your religion.
No...

22:21.800 --> 22:24.960
But I don't think I can be with you
knowing it won't turn sexual.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.960
No, I'm serious...
Goodbye, Mo.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.960
I'm serious!

22:28.960 --> 22:30.960
Ella-Grace!

22:32.800 --> 22:33.960
SIGHS

22:40.960 --> 22:43.960
GROANS

22:52.960 --> 22:55.960
Thomas, I brought you back
to my area to show you some statues

22:55.960 --> 22:58.800
that will make you better
understand me.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.960
RUSTLING

23:00.960 --> 23:04.960
You asked me if I was ready for an
ethical non-monogamous relationship.

23:06.960 --> 23:11.960
And now I know the answer. You see,
I've always been the tough guy.

23:11.960 --> 23:15.480
Liam Hughes will tell you that.
No, no! Please don't hurt me!

23:15.480 --> 23:16.960
Do I get me fiver now, or what?

23:16.960 --> 23:19.960
But you taught me that I don't have
to hide behind a tough guy image.

23:20.960 --> 23:24.640
You taught me that it's good to be
vulnerable and to lay yourself bare.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.960
Then you can live moments you'll
remember for the rest of your life.

23:27.960 --> 23:30.960
So yeah, I'm ready...

23:30.960 --> 23:34.960
ready to tell you that you
can't use ethical non-monogamy

23:34.960 --> 23:37.640
as an excuse
to treat people like shit!

23:37.640 --> 23:41.000
It's your choice if you want many,
even if it's at the same time.

23:43.960 --> 23:46.960
But the clue's in the name.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.960
"Ethical".

23:48.960 --> 23:50.960
There's ways to go about it, lad.

23:50.960 --> 23:55.960
Either way, it's not what I want,
cos I don't wanna be one of many.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.960
I wanna be the one.

23:57.960 --> 23:59.960
Seen by only one.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.960
Isn't that truly what a soulmate is?

24:05.960 --> 24:10.320
And our time together's made me
realise I wanna find that soulmate,

24:10.320 --> 24:11.960
so...

24:12.960 --> 24:14.960
...goodbye, Thomas.

24:17.320 --> 24:19.960
You're the boss, lad.

24:19.960 --> 24:21.320
He's too good for you.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.960
Well done, kid.

24:27.960 --> 24:30.960
OK?
Yeah. Thanks for that, lads.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.960
I lost me head for a bit there.
God, any time, mate.

24:32.960 --> 24:36.480
Can I ask you something?
Yeah.

24:36.480 --> 24:38.960
You know all these gay questions?
Yeah.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.960
You're taking the piss really,
aren't you?

24:40.960 --> 24:43.320
Oh, no, mate. I'm genuinely curious.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.960
Yeah, look, I've got a list
of questions for you.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.960
Here y'are, let me have a look...

24:49.960 --> 24:52.960
You know when youse
are gonna have sex,

24:52.960 --> 24:54.960
how do you know who bums who?

24:54.960 --> 24:56.000
LAUGHS

24:56.000 --> 24:58.960
Come here,
me little curly-haired homophobe.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.960
You've got so much to learn.
