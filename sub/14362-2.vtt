Get up!

00:05.889 --> 00:06.769
Get up!

00:07.091 --> 00:08.730
First day of school!
I mean it, people!

00:08.851 --> 00:10.729
We are not gonna be
the la-- Oh.

00:11.153 --> 00:13.123
- You're up already.
- Yep.

00:13.238 --> 00:14.626
Turns out with no Axl

00:14.736 --> 00:16.447
pulling his dirty underwear
over my head

00:16.545 --> 00:19.731
yelling, "Time's up!" and
dragging me out of the bathroom,

00:19.835 --> 00:21.229
I had time to shower
this morning.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.949
I was even able to
rinse and repeat.

00:24.207 --> 00:25.357
Get up!

00:25.439 --> 00:27.064
First day of school!
Get up!

00:27.157 --> 00:29.070
I'm sick of-- Oh.

00:29.171 --> 00:30.194
They're up already.

00:30.289 --> 00:31.840
I couldn't sleep anyway,
it was so hot.

00:31.951 --> 00:33.572
When are we getting
the air conditioner fixed?

00:33.755 --> 00:35.180
I tried
packing myself in popsicles,

00:35.275 --> 00:36.819
but I woke up covered in ants.

00:36.926 --> 00:39.392
I told you, you don't fix the
air conditioner when it's hot.

00:39.483 --> 00:41.973
You wait till winter when
the AC guys are desperate,

00:42.077 --> 00:43.361
and then you get a discount.

00:43.570 --> 00:46.524
That's why I'm going tomorrow
to look at snowblowers.

00:46.794 --> 00:49.289
Is that why you guys didn't
buy us any school supplies?

00:49.379 --> 00:50.381
No.
That we just forgot.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.599
Look, you can get them in a
couple weeks when they're cheap.

00:52.868 --> 00:54.466
Meantime, you can just
borrow from friends.

00:54.641 --> 00:57.678
Um, that'll be probably be
more of a two-step process.

00:58.877 --> 00:59.994
What are you doing?

01:00.082 --> 01:02.661
Texting Axl to remind him
he has Philosophy at 9:00.

01:02.749 --> 01:04.226
You know,
he's not a morning person.

01:04.328 --> 01:05.804
Come on.
He's a big boy, Frankie.

01:05.959 --> 01:07.443
He doesn't need mommy
waking him up.

01:10.935 --> 01:13.298
I've been thinking, why do I need
to go to middle school, anyway?

01:13.491 --> 01:14.678
You know,
I've done some research,

01:14.765 --> 01:16.580
and homeschooling
is not out of the question.

01:16.678 --> 01:17.582
It is at this home.

01:17.680 --> 01:19.142
What now, Brick?

01:19.295 --> 01:20.627
Is this about the asbestos
again?

01:20.702 --> 01:23.089
'Cause I told you, they got that
down to acceptable levels.

01:23.266 --> 01:24.744
Okay, I'd be lying if I said

01:24.845 --> 01:26.273
I didn't have some concerns,

01:26.456 --> 01:28.913
not the least of which is
I can't go to the bathroom.

01:29.013 --> 01:30.900
Unh-unh.
No more quirks. You're done.

01:31.032 --> 01:31.932
It's not that.

01:32.082 --> 01:34.242
Everyone knows if a sixth grader
goes to the bathroom,

01:34.380 --> 01:36.595
eighth graders wait in there
to give him a swirlie.

01:36.702 --> 01:38.940
Brick, that's just a
stupid legend that goes around.

01:39.039 --> 01:40.935
That stuff doesn't really
happen. Mike, tell him.

01:41.020 --> 01:42.987
Did you ever in your whole life
get a swirlie?

01:43.161 --> 01:44.462
I didn't <i>get</i> them.

01:44.769 --> 01:45.745
You'll be fine.

01:46.286 --> 01:47.916
<i>While Brick was worried</i>
<i>about getting swirlied,</i>

01:48.049 --> 01:49.832
<i>Sue wasn't worried</i>
<i>about a thing.</i>

01:49.940 --> 01:50.968
Oh, my God.

01:51.066 --> 01:52.439
This feels amazing!

01:52.625 --> 01:55.711
I can't believe I'm actually
getting to walk down this hall.

01:55.808 --> 01:57.040
I know. Me too.

01:57.273 --> 01:58.504
Wait. Why?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.562
Axl's locker was on this hall,

02:00.657 --> 02:02.414
and he would never
let me walk down it,

02:02.548 --> 02:04.589
even though I had a class here.

02:04.751 --> 02:06.777
I would have to go outside,
and the old crossing guard

02:06.878 --> 02:09.424
would lift me up so I could
crawl through the window.

02:09.652 --> 02:12.085
Sue, we don't have
a crossing guard.

02:12.403 --> 02:14.367
Huh.
Then who was that?

02:14.459 --> 02:16.477
Anyway, I am free now.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.288
I can go wherever I want.

02:18.407 --> 02:19.969
I can do whatever I want.

02:20.133 --> 02:22.360
I can even
dance down this hallway,

02:22.458 --> 02:24.643
and there's no one here
to call me a dork.

02:24.737 --> 02:26.896
- You don't have to ask me twice!
- Whoo!

02:29.261 --> 02:30.777
Hey.

02:30.878 --> 02:31.914
Just getting home from work?

02:32.244 --> 02:34.432
Yep. Had to
catch up on some things.

02:34.539 --> 02:35.501
Uh-huh.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.776
You were sitting in the car with the
air-conditioning on, weren't you?

02:37.890 --> 02:40.556
Hey, you're always saying
you want some alone time,

02:40.690 --> 02:43.258
and I didn't know we were putting
frozen chicken down our shirts.

02:43.365 --> 02:44.895
Not when it's 100 degrees.

02:45.004 --> 02:47.862
When it's hot, I want
people around to complain to.

02:47.997 --> 02:49.060
Ugh.

02:49.152 --> 02:50.603
I can never get ahold of Axl.

02:50.688 --> 02:52.766
I swear,
this kid never texts me back.

02:52.869 --> 02:54.243
I don't hear from him anymore.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.085
What do you need to get in touch
with him for, anyway?

02:56.192 --> 02:57.763
Well, for one, he's my son,

02:57.865 --> 02:59.374
and I'd like to know
he's been eating.

02:59.555 --> 03:01.398
He's fine, Frankie.
He's an athlete.

03:01.502 --> 03:03.067
The coaches make sure
they eat right.

03:07.400 --> 03:08.999
Well, it's not just that.

03:09.112 --> 03:11.151
There's been some mix-up in his
schedule, and I need to make sure

03:11.253 --> 03:13.067
that he transferred out of
Intro to Sosh.

03:13.168 --> 03:14.717
You know what?
I'm just gonna call him.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.577
Hey, buddy.
How was--

03:16.669 --> 03:17.737
Bathroom.
Bathroom.

03:17.833 --> 03:19.546
Bathroom.
Bathroom.

03:21.878 --> 03:23.448
- He's not picking up.
- Hey, pal.

03:23.591 --> 03:26.499
Did you ever transfer
out of Intro to Sosh?

03:26.598 --> 03:29.230
Done. You know a cool thing
about being a football player?

03:29.324 --> 03:32.151
They sent some kid over to do it
for me 'cause I'm, like, way busy.

03:32.288 --> 03:34.058
- Sweet!
- All right, then.

03:34.157 --> 03:35.376
I'm gonna let you go.

03:36.462 --> 03:38.344
What was that?
He answered?

03:38.452 --> 03:40.393
- Yeah.
- What do you mean, "Yeah"?

03:40.581 --> 03:42.674
- Does he usually answer?
- Yeah.

03:42.853 --> 03:43.872
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

03:44.033 --> 03:46.505
Okay, so, you're saying
when you text him,

03:46.679 --> 03:49.030
- he texts you back?
- Yeah.

03:49.220 --> 03:50.742
Oh, my God.

03:50.868 --> 03:51.918
We have any dip?

03:52.064 --> 03:53.663
No, we don't
have any dip, Mike.

03:53.824 --> 03:55.699
I can't believe
Axl has been texting you

03:55.793 --> 03:58.260
this whole time
and he won't text me!

03:58.385 --> 03:59.939
Oh, come on.
He's texted you.

04:00.039 --> 04:01.927
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was wrong.

04:02.026 --> 04:03.368
I did get one text.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.728
It said, "K-D-J-J-J."

04:05.842 --> 04:06.930
Pretty sure it was a butt text.

04:07.033 --> 04:09.346
So, yes,
I have heard from Axl's butt.

04:09.495 --> 04:10.667
Well, that's something.

04:11.814 --> 04:14.421
I just don't get it, Mike!

04:14.667 --> 04:16.742
Why won't he text me back?!

04:16.869 --> 04:18.307
Why is he doing this to me?!

04:18.440 --> 04:20.594
Why won't he answer my calls?!

04:20.711 --> 04:22.583
Maybe 'cause of
that voice right there?

04:22.745 --> 04:24.967
I'm just saying,
moms can be kind of clingy.

04:25.097 --> 04:26.439
You got to be
cooler about this.

04:26.768 --> 04:28.635
I'm... cool.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.415
Look, you can't
text him all the time.

04:30.510 --> 04:31.838
You got to space them out.

04:31.929 --> 04:32.806
And if you just called him,

04:32.928 --> 04:34.677
maybe wait a couple days before
you call him again.

04:34.870 --> 04:36.314
Oh, and be sure to
hang up first.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.682
You don't want to be
the rambly one.

04:37.867 --> 04:39.451
You want to
make him come to you.

04:39.742 --> 04:41.621
I'm not trying to date my son.

04:41.796 --> 04:44.546
Trust me, Frankie, you just got
to give him time to miss you.

04:46.802 --> 04:48.866
But that could take years!

04:53.352 --> 04:55.483
Why is this thing
even on, Mike?

04:55.591 --> 04:58.173
That vent's just blowing
air from the outside.

04:58.289 --> 05:00.775
Look, you need the airflow
to cool you off when you sweat.

05:00.874 --> 05:02.301
It's nature's
air-conditioning.

05:02.396 --> 05:03.607
I don't want
nature's air-conditioning.

05:03.695 --> 05:05.502
I want
people's air-conditioning.

05:06.067 --> 05:08.286
Thanks, but I'm off liquids
until June.

05:08.466 --> 05:10.922
I'm training myself
not to go to the bathroom.

05:11.028 --> 05:12.673
Brick, you need to
drink something.

05:12.769 --> 05:14.067
Your kidneys
are gonna shut down,

05:14.156 --> 05:15.547
and we can't afford that.

05:15.644 --> 05:17.529
Why are you still sitting
in a lawn chair, Brick?

05:17.670 --> 05:19.803
You know, you don't have to be
in a lawn chair

05:19.889 --> 05:21.756
when there's a perfectly good
chair right there.

05:22.025 --> 05:24.437
Unh-unh. That's Axl's.
No way.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.063
Well, he's gone now.

05:26.267 --> 05:30.791
Finally, we are the size family
we were always meant to be.

05:33.405 --> 05:34.747
What?

05:34.882 --> 05:36.493
I thought
I heard my phone buzz.

05:37.810 --> 05:39.220
Look, it's been radio silence,

05:39.314 --> 05:40.587
and I've done
everything you said.

05:40.693 --> 05:42.211
I have been so good.

05:42.332 --> 05:44.345
I went for two days
without calling him.

05:44.492 --> 05:46.571
I waited 36 hours between texts

05:46.713 --> 05:49.336
and not one word back--
nothing.

05:49.489 --> 05:51.469
I said, "How'z it hanging?"
With a "Z."

05:51.579 --> 05:53.069
It doesn't get
more casual than that.

05:53.190 --> 05:55.724
I followed your stupid rules
and nothing--

05:55.824 --> 05:57.313
I still get nothing.

05:57.621 --> 05:59.274
Look, it's like I said before,
Frankie.

05:59.362 --> 06:00.538
You're too needy.

06:00.677 --> 06:02.267
Guys can smell that,
and they run.

06:02.361 --> 06:04.000
I can't help it.
I miss my son.

06:04.082 --> 06:05.202
It's normal to miss your son.

06:05.303 --> 06:06.413
It's normal for him to be gone.

06:06.580 --> 06:07.911
So you're saying
you don't miss him at all?

06:08.079 --> 06:10.755
I'm saying
it's how it's supposed to be.

06:11.441 --> 06:13.856
I mean, I-I'm perfectly fine
with him being gone.

06:14.039 --> 06:15.456
I'd be fine
if these two were gone.

06:15.724 --> 06:16.878
Right here, dad.

06:17.004 --> 06:18.416
- You know what I mean.
- Mm.

06:18.583 --> 06:20.124
Dad's right.
I'm just gonna say it.

06:20.296 --> 06:22.158
I am glad that Axl's gone.

06:22.268 --> 06:24.111
And I'm not sorry
for saying it, either.

06:24.229 --> 06:27.151
He insulted me
roughly 56 times a day,

06:27.266 --> 06:28.446
and that's being conservative.

06:28.579 --> 06:31.413
I mean, you guys have no idea
how many times it happened.

06:31.662 --> 06:34.039
- Dork says, "Hey."
- Hey!

06:34.209 --> 06:36.241
I'm sorry, but I'm a huge
supporter of animal rights,

06:36.345 --> 06:39.050
and I just think it's wrong
to put a monkey in clothes.

06:39.315 --> 06:41.041
Which finger smells like butt?

06:41.135 --> 06:42.510
Which finger
smells like butt, huh?

06:42.610 --> 06:44.275
Trick question.
They all do.

06:44.369 --> 06:46.205
- Aah!
- Aggh!

06:46.712 --> 06:48.185
But that's all in the past now.

06:48.340 --> 06:50.517
Axl's reign of terror is over.

06:50.907 --> 06:52.848
We're done
being called Pew and Ick.

06:52.995 --> 06:54.586
We are done cleaning his room

06:54.689 --> 06:57.096
only to find out
there was no 10 bucks!

06:57.250 --> 06:59.960
Our time has come, Brick. If you
won't sit in his chair, I will!

07:06.121 --> 07:07.371
We're free now.

07:07.738 --> 07:09.757
Our brother
can't hurt us anymore.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.482
Still better than
having him here.

07:34.352 --> 07:35.578
I'm honored, sir,
that you would call

07:35.671 --> 07:37.231
and trust me
in my area of expertise.

07:37.369 --> 07:38.483
So, can you fix it?

07:38.635 --> 07:39.880
No, absolutely not.

07:40.045 --> 07:42.918
I've only had two classes, and
one was picking out our shirts.

07:43.047 --> 07:44.535
<i>Okay. Future professional.</i>

07:44.620 --> 07:46.668
Well, fine. Just--
just do what you can, Darrin.

07:46.757 --> 07:48.254
Limp it along till December.

07:48.420 --> 07:49.855
Okay, but just so you know,

07:50.022 --> 07:51.832
I wouldn't feel right
about taking your money.

07:52.144 --> 07:53.748
Good, 'cause
I can't give you any.

07:59.136 --> 08:01.067
I can't take it!
I got to go!

08:01.166 --> 08:02.882
Are you crazy?
You can't go to the bathroom.

08:03.019 --> 08:04.936
Don't you know what happens
to kids who go in there?

08:05.075 --> 08:06.667
I heard there's
an old eighth grader in there

08:06.808 --> 08:08.948
who never graduated,
and if you try to run from him,

08:09.097 --> 08:11.296
your feet get stuck to the floor
because of all the pee.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.955
Well, I heard about someone
getting a royal flush.

08:14.134 --> 08:15.611
That's a double swirlie!

08:15.773 --> 08:17.300
He drank so much toilet water

08:17.445 --> 08:18.891
that eggs grew in his stomach.

08:19.046 --> 08:20.332
And when he
went to the hospital

08:20.440 --> 08:21.734
to get them
removed from his stomach,

08:21.898 --> 08:23.970
spiders crawled out.

08:28.329 --> 08:29.435
Oh.

08:30.032 --> 08:30.973
Hi.

08:31.078 --> 08:31.974
Hi!

08:37.866 --> 08:39.952
What's with us and trash, huh?

08:40.051 --> 08:41.750
Yeah.
It's like we're flies.

08:41.895 --> 08:43.003
Yeah.

08:43.342 --> 08:44.871
So, wow.

08:45.008 --> 08:46.473
I didn't even
realize you were here.

08:46.729 --> 08:48.515
The first rule of
being a good service technician

08:48.726 --> 08:51.585
is not disturbing
the occupants of the dwelling.

08:53.735 --> 08:55.834
Anyway, so, how's school going?

08:56.052 --> 08:57.135
Oh, it's great.

08:57.266 --> 08:59.330
Uh, I have a ton of
responsibilities this year.

08:59.534 --> 09:02.780
You may have heard--
I am a Junior Peer Leadership Adviser.

09:02.886 --> 09:04.653
You know, a JP-la.

09:04.757 --> 09:07.028
Yeah. I don't think
I knew they had those.

09:07.885 --> 09:09.086
Anyway,

09:09.197 --> 09:13.294
look at you,
Mr. Repairman... man.

09:13.392 --> 09:14.750
Yeah. And look at you.

09:15.041 --> 09:16.436
You do something different
with your hair?

09:16.552 --> 09:18.303
Oh, I'm rinsing
and repeating now.

09:18.487 --> 09:19.485
Me too.

09:19.614 --> 09:20.792
A lot of work goes into this.

09:26.392 --> 09:29.345
Well, I should probably
get going.

09:29.437 --> 09:32.175
You know, all the
JP-la responsibilities.

09:32.330 --> 09:34.572
And I should probably get back
to not being able to fix this.

09:36.931 --> 09:39.950
Okay. Well, bye.

09:40.118 --> 09:41.450
Bye.

09:41.742 --> 09:42.728
Uh, Sue?

09:42.831 --> 09:44.074
Mm-hmm?

09:46.166 --> 09:48.222
Oh.

09:52.914 --> 09:55.818
Oh, hey. Want to hear
an interesting conversation?

09:55.977 --> 09:56.908
Not especially.

09:57.023 --> 09:58.445
Mike-- "Call your mom."

09:58.568 --> 10:00.570
Axl-- "Ugh. Why?"

10:00.688 --> 10:02.118
What are you doing?
Is that my phone?

10:02.256 --> 10:05.452
Mike-- "'Cause she's your mom,
and she wants to hear from you."

10:05.582 --> 10:08.273
Axl-- "Why, does she have
extra nag minutes?"

10:08.392 --> 10:10.184
Mike-- "LOL".

10:10.340 --> 10:12.489
LOL?
You LOL'd that?

10:12.626 --> 10:14.192
You thought that was
laugh out loud?

10:14.299 --> 10:16.736
When have you ever
laughed out loud at anything?

10:16.900 --> 10:18.575
Look, I was just
trying to help you out.

10:18.696 --> 10:20.888
Oh, sure,
'cause your little marionette

10:20.983 --> 10:24.011
will only call his mom if the
puppet master pulls the strings?

10:24.188 --> 10:25.593
You know, this is why--

10:26.436 --> 10:27.771
Forget it.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.412
What? Say it.

10:29.549 --> 10:30.507
Nope. Don't want to.

10:30.591 --> 10:32.792
No, this is why what?

10:33.189 --> 10:34.626
Nobody wants to talk to me?

10:34.761 --> 10:37.228
You know what, Frankie?
This is dangerous territory.

10:37.329 --> 10:39.437
So, let's just forget it.
Now, give me my phone back.

10:39.539 --> 10:42.127
Yeah. Okay, okay, but just
h-h-h-hold on a second.

10:42.233 --> 10:43.554
Why? What are you doing?

10:43.668 --> 10:46.212
Hey, give-- give-- give me
the phone. Give it back!

10:46.327 --> 10:47.949
I want to see what you're doing.

10:48.045 --> 10:49.962
I-I am not kidding you.
You give me the stupid phone.

10:50.051 --> 10:51.351
- Hey! What are you, nuts?
- Give-- give--

10:51.453 --> 10:54.008
- What is this? - I don't know. How would
I know when it's not my phone?

10:54.109 --> 10:55.629
Oh, my God!

10:57.511 --> 10:59.706
Are you texting Axl as me?

10:59.831 --> 11:01.342
What?! No!

11:02.225 --> 11:03.741
"Hey, hotshot.

11:03.838 --> 11:05.358
How about that sports team?

11:05.516 --> 11:06.993
And are you
getting enough sleep?"

11:07.098 --> 11:09.214
- Frankie, really?
- Well, I'm sorry.

11:09.319 --> 11:10.454
I want to hear from my son,

11:10.560 --> 11:12.380
and I am not too proud
to pretend to be you to do it.

11:12.542 --> 11:13.927
I'm all left out in the cold

11:14.034 --> 11:15.998
while you two
are little texting buddies.

11:16.111 --> 11:18.088
Text, text, text.
"OMG".

11:18.194 --> 11:20.238
"LMAO".
"Dad's so awesome."

11:20.348 --> 11:22.110
"Smiley face.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."

11:23.315 --> 11:25.855
Fine. Just forget it.
You can have each other.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.846
You just get off on your
little bicycle built for two

11:27.947 --> 11:29.486
and ride off into the sunset.

11:29.601 --> 11:31.739
Just remember this--
Sue likes me better,

11:31.878 --> 11:32.942
and when she
goes off to college,

11:33.052 --> 11:34.408
I'm gonna tell her
not to call you.

11:34.905 --> 11:36.680
What?!
But I love dad.

11:36.769 --> 11:38.048
I would never do that!

11:38.284 --> 11:40.178
Go to bed, Sue.

11:48.707 --> 11:51.235
<i>As more tall tales of the</i>
<i>bathroom swept through school,</i>

11:51.358 --> 11:53.667
<i>Brick's quest</i>
<i>to give up liquids continued.</i>

11:53.798 --> 11:56.011
<i>He survived the track unit</i>
<i>in gym class.</i>

11:56.120 --> 11:57.326
Ten more laps!

11:57.433 --> 11:59.265
And don't forget
to drink lots of water!

11:59.358 --> 12:00.477
It's hot!

12:02.942 --> 12:04.076
<i>He survived science class,</i>

12:04.214 --> 12:05.958
<i>where they were</i>
<i>studying the Sun.</i>

12:11.067 --> 12:14.350
<i>But what he hadn't counted on</i>
<i>was Ms. Harvey's fifth period.</i>

12:14.459 --> 12:16.157
Today, we are sampling foods

12:16.252 --> 12:18.169
from our neighbor
to the south--

12:18.744 --> 12:20.039
<i>MÃ©jico!</i>

12:20.134 --> 12:21.033
<i>Cuidado.</i>

12:21.131 --> 12:23.847
The salsa is <i>muy caliente.</i>

12:23.940 --> 12:25.768
That's Mexican for "hot."

12:42.129 --> 12:43.145
Hey, Brad.

12:43.345 --> 12:44.717
I need to talk to you
about something.

12:44.897 --> 12:46.462
It's about Darrin.

12:46.564 --> 12:47.702
Ooh.

12:47.822 --> 12:49.454
I'll set the table.
You bring the dish.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.259
Okay, well, he came over
to our house yesterday.

12:52.382 --> 12:54.660
- What? Awkward.
- Yeah.

12:54.798 --> 12:55.932
At first.

12:56.052 --> 12:57.435
But then it was kind of nice.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.525
Kind of like
we'd never even broken up.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.785
It was like there was
this spark or something.

13:02.896 --> 13:04.377
And maybe this spark
is creating

13:04.490 --> 13:06.861
a blazing inferno
inside your heart?

13:07.035 --> 13:08.189
Maybe.

13:08.436 --> 13:10.117
It's just, I got to thinking.

13:10.288 --> 13:12.896
Darrin and I always
had a lot of fun together.

13:13.015 --> 13:16.832
We would play mini golf,
have crazy dance competitions,

13:16.963 --> 13:20.196
go through a drive-through
and order with British accents.

13:20.381 --> 13:22.699
The only reason
I really broke up with him

13:22.834 --> 13:25.341
was 'cause Axl
was being so weird about it.

13:25.468 --> 13:27.748
But I'm not living my life
for Axl anymore.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.113
Sue, when you
broke up with Darrin,

13:29.211 --> 13:31.879
I was all supportive, and I
said, "Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh."

13:31.987 --> 13:33.741
But inside,
I was like, "No, no, no!"

13:33.872 --> 13:35.581
- So you think I should go for it?
- Uh-huh.

13:35.704 --> 13:38.649
And the real "Uh-huh."
Not the one with the screaming "No" inside.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.083
I can't hold it anymore.

13:44.196 --> 13:45.451
I'm going to the bathroom.

13:45.711 --> 13:47.175
No, you won't survive!

13:47.355 --> 13:48.651
Want to punch me in the eye?

13:48.767 --> 13:51.264
Then you can go to the vice principal's
office and use his bathroom.

13:51.411 --> 13:54.060
That's all the way to Building "A."
I'll never make it.

13:54.196 --> 13:56.137
Building "A."
Whoop!

13:56.282 --> 13:57.352
Try sneaking in.

13:57.468 --> 13:59.851
Maybe that way, you won't
draw attention to yourself.

14:01.339 --> 14:02.525
No.

14:03.232 --> 14:04.452
No sneaking.

14:04.589 --> 14:06.282
We're sixth graders.

14:06.484 --> 14:08.561
Yeah, we may not
have hair on our arms

14:08.663 --> 14:10.631
or the courage
to look a girl in the eye,

14:10.755 --> 14:13.791
and we sometimes yearn for
the days of scheduled nap time,

14:13.995 --> 14:15.747
but we're still men--

14:15.878 --> 14:18.947
small men,
but men nonetheless--

14:19.197 --> 14:21.892
and it's time to
start acting like it.

14:23.042 --> 14:24.596
<i>So Brick set out to go</i>

14:24.689 --> 14:27.088
<i>where no sixth grader</i>
<i>had ever gone before--</i>

14:27.689 --> 14:28.940
<i>the bathroom.</i>

14:53.745 --> 14:55.082
Hey, how's it going?

14:55.482 --> 14:56.756
Hey.

15:01.795 --> 15:03.411
That big kid came out
and Brick didn't.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.890
Something horrible
has happened.

15:05.140 --> 15:06.664
Maybe we should
go in and help him.

15:06.769 --> 15:08.604
You go.
Brick and I aren't that close.

15:16.386 --> 15:18.124
- Yes!
- All right!

15:18.229 --> 15:19.363
<i>So Brick was a hero,</i>

15:19.472 --> 15:22.433
<i>admired and respected</i>
<i>by his fellow classmates--</i>

15:22.551 --> 15:24.416
<i>for about 10 seconds until...</i>

15:35.698 --> 15:36.776
Hey, Mr. Heck.

15:36.890 --> 15:38.184
I've completed
a thorough diagnostic,

15:38.297 --> 15:41.220
and I've determined I have no
idea what's wrong with the unit.

15:41.371 --> 15:44.205
But on the plus side, we have a
class on condensers Tuesday,

15:44.335 --> 15:47.052
so here's hoping
it's the condenser, huh?

15:47.152 --> 15:49.026
Yeah, well, don't count on it.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.414
It's our house.

15:50.656 --> 15:52.405
So, hey,
the Colts game's about to start.

15:52.535 --> 15:53.633
Why don't you
stick around and watch?

15:53.723 --> 15:55.834
- Oh, that sounds great.
- All right!

15:56.713 --> 15:57.952
But I can't.

15:58.198 --> 15:59.640
Aw, come on.
I owe you.

15:59.763 --> 16:01.946
The Pacers are in preseason,
the Colts are in San Francisco,

16:02.075 --> 16:03.406
Brick just read our TV manual,

16:03.512 --> 16:05.499
and it turns out
we got picture-in-picture.

16:05.610 --> 16:07.449
You know, I appreciate it,
but I got to go.

16:07.761 --> 16:09.284
It's really hot in here.

16:12.113 --> 16:14.207
<i>Yep-- turns out Mike</i>
<i>wasn't as fine as he thought</i>

16:14.307 --> 16:15.650
<i>with Axl being gone.</i>

16:28.813 --> 16:32.102
- Still here, dad.
- Oh. Sorry.

16:34.447 --> 16:35.912
Hey, you want to
watch the game?

16:36.040 --> 16:37.270
No, I do not.

16:43.757 --> 16:45.639
Uh. Uh.

16:45.732 --> 16:47.621
Darrin! Darrin!
Wait up. Wait up.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.567
Sorry.
I take abnormally big steps.

16:49.762 --> 16:51.074
I'm hard to keep up with.

16:51.303 --> 16:52.533
Uh, listen.

16:53.441 --> 16:54.829
How do I say this?

16:55.589 --> 16:57.793
Okay, uh, ever since
Axl's been gone,

16:57.898 --> 17:00.622
I don't know if you've noticed,
but I have just sort of

17:00.719 --> 17:02.977
blossomed into
this whole new person,

17:03.131 --> 17:05.582
and I started thinking more
about what I want,

17:05.757 --> 17:08.017
and I just kind of
wondered if--

17:08.132 --> 17:09.163
Hey, dude.

17:09.267 --> 17:10.220
Oh, hi, Angel.

17:10.335 --> 17:11.366
Angel, this is Sue.

17:11.473 --> 17:12.772
Sue, this is Angel.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.844
Angel's in the cosmetology
program at Orson Beauty Academy.

17:15.970 --> 17:18.018
We share a parking lot
and a cafeteria with them.

17:18.133 --> 17:19.542
Cool!

17:19.695 --> 17:21.885
Ooh, I really like your nails.

17:22.003 --> 17:23.691
Thanks, yeah,
I posted them on Facebook,

17:23.786 --> 17:26.719
and so far
I've gotten 16 likes.

17:26.847 --> 17:29.266
Ah! Amazing!

17:29.352 --> 17:31.348
So, can we go somewhere
and talk?

17:31.481 --> 17:32.664
We were going to the movies.

17:32.759 --> 17:34.256
Oh. Okay. Yeah.

17:34.337 --> 17:37.355
I guess we can all do that,
and then we can talk after?

17:37.607 --> 17:39.149
No, I meant the two of us.

17:39.238 --> 17:40.368
Oh.

17:40.491 --> 17:43.247
Well, that's weird,
'cause what is Angel gonna do?

17:43.364 --> 17:44.543
She's right there.

17:44.645 --> 17:47.629
Sue, Angel and I go to
the movies every Sunday night.

17:47.724 --> 17:49.442
Well, that just
makes it worse, Darrin,

17:49.530 --> 17:51.054
'cause now
she's expecting to go.

17:51.182 --> 17:53.807
We better get going, Darrin. The
movie's gonna be starting soon.

17:53.896 --> 17:55.394
If we miss
any of the first five minutes,

17:55.475 --> 17:56.949
he's lost, like,
the whole movie.

17:57.056 --> 17:59.990
And then I'm asking her a bunch of
questions, which drives her crazy.

18:00.064 --> 18:01.940
You're lucky you're cute.

18:02.770 --> 18:05.406
Oh, wait!

18:05.663 --> 18:07.566
I can't go to the movies.

18:07.799 --> 18:10.395
Where is my head?

18:10.500 --> 18:12.000
Oh, there it is!

18:15.284 --> 18:18.861
Anyhoo, uh, the thing is,
I totally promised my mom

18:18.961 --> 18:22.773
that I would help her...
make bolognese sauce.

18:22.876 --> 18:23.894
It's really
labor-intensive,

18:24.009 --> 18:26.502
but don't ask her about it,
because she won't remember.

18:26.613 --> 18:27.699
She's old.

18:27.971 --> 18:31.618
So have fun, you two!

18:32.028 --> 18:33.677
Go! Go!

18:34.480 --> 18:35.763
Okay, so, yeah.
The story is...

18:36.661 --> 18:38.705
Oh, hey, Sue,

18:38.873 --> 18:40.489
what did you want to
talk to me about?

18:40.794 --> 18:42.472
Oh, nothing.

18:42.767 --> 18:45.527
Uh, it was just
about the air conditioner

18:45.981 --> 18:49.977
and how it's broken
and can never be fixed.

18:50.576 --> 18:53.350
But we waited too long
to fix it,

18:53.978 --> 18:56.131
so I guess that's our fault.

18:56.236 --> 18:59.463
Well, regular air-conditioning
maintenance is important.

19:03.275 --> 19:05.416
It really is.

19:10.407 --> 19:12.558
What are you doing
sitting alone in the dark?

19:13.183 --> 19:15.562
Oh, light bulbs are hot.
They heat up the room.

19:15.673 --> 19:17.275
So, why didn't you go outside?

19:17.579 --> 19:19.212
'Cause I'm getting ready
to watch the game.

19:20.143 --> 19:23.838
With the phone in your hand and
the remote on top of the TV?

19:25.039 --> 19:26.546
You don't know
how I watch games.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.118
Oh, I know plenty.

19:28.373 --> 19:29.785
And you know what I think?

19:30.288 --> 19:31.897
I think you miss your son.

19:32.093 --> 19:33.082
Stop it.

19:33.186 --> 19:34.631
No, you do.

19:34.813 --> 19:37.483
You've got your phone in your
hand so you can keep checking it

19:37.590 --> 19:40.322
so you don't miss any possible
texts or phone calls.

19:40.479 --> 19:42.427
I know the symptoms, Mike.

19:42.634 --> 19:43.648
You miss your son.

19:43.763 --> 19:44.741
I do not.

19:44.849 --> 19:46.141
Admit it, Mike.

19:46.332 --> 19:48.409
You love your son.

19:48.505 --> 19:50.346
You love your son.

19:50.984 --> 19:53.060
Look, East Indiana played
Concordia yesterday,

19:53.173 --> 19:55.377
and I thought he would call
to tell me about the game,

19:55.500 --> 19:57.815
but he got busy, I guess.

19:57.910 --> 20:01.089
That's fine.
It's just... different.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.330
Axl and I were--

20:04.402 --> 20:06.330
you know,
we spent a lot of time together.

20:08.448 --> 20:10.963
- I don't really relate to Brick.
- Right here, dad.

20:11.057 --> 20:12.656
Nothing I wouldn't say
to your face.

20:13.654 --> 20:16.329
Well, this probably isn't
the time to rub it in,

20:16.476 --> 20:20.157
but I got a text
from Axl today.

20:20.402 --> 20:23.082
- "Send shampoo."
- Huh.

20:23.610 --> 20:25.626
Looks like
I'm the new favorite.

20:39.126 --> 20:40.797
_

20:45.130 --> 20:47.152
Hey! You're supposed to be
away at college.

20:47.283 --> 20:49.128
You got to stop calling so much.

20:49.303 --> 20:50.481
I know, right?

20:50.599 --> 20:52.593
- You, uh, watching the Colts?
- Yeah.

20:52.706 --> 20:54.701
What a fourth quarter, huh?
Did you see that pass to Wayne?

20:54.837 --> 20:56.149
Oh, yeah.
On the slant?

20:56.347 --> 20:58.138
- What a grab.
- Yeah. Awesome.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.123
Um, oh, hey, your mom is gonna
send you that shampoo,

21:00.236 --> 21:02.861
- so be looking for that.
- Okay. Will do.

21:02.966 --> 21:05.490
Oh, and, hey, don't, uh, let her
just put a bunch of dishwashing soap

21:05.601 --> 21:08.585
into a shampoo bottle,
'cause I know she does that.

21:08.676 --> 21:11.058
Okay. I'll make sure.

21:11.310 --> 21:13.233
So, uh, what's going on there?

21:13.533 --> 21:15.290
Oh, well, not much.

21:15.547 --> 21:17.501
Oh, I went outside yesterday,

21:17.771 --> 21:20.815
and, uh, I see that Ron Donahue

21:20.985 --> 21:22.821
bought
a brand-new leaf blower.

21:22.967 --> 21:23.957
Peak of the season.

21:24.587 --> 21:25.788
Just throwing money away.

21:25.789 --> 21:28.004
Sucker.

21:28.005 --> 21:29.248
â™ª the guy.

21:29.249 --> 21:31.993
Oh, so, tell me about
your game yesterday.

21:31.994 --> 21:33.249
- How did it go?
- Oh...
