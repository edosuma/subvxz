Us? Did-did you explain that
we have a strictly "detective

station" relationship?

03:45.192 --> 03:46.362
It doesn't matter.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.590
Actually, given the fact
that he's trying

03:47.595 --> 03:49.425
to dismantle everything
that we're doing,

03:49.430 --> 03:51.630
yeah, I think maybe it does.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.565
Look, I was a cop
when we got married.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.670
It worked out for him.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.112

a badge on your arm

when you're climbing
up the political ladder.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.409
Trouble is,
that he never came down.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.281
Never came home.
Forgot about his son.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.581
Left me at home to just
read all the e-mails

04:09.583 --> 04:11.453

from other women.

04:13.087 --> 04:16.387
I got tired of living that life,
so I had an affair of my own.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.120
Okay? And that...
That's that.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.526
Getting clearer, now.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.628

this is some kind of,

04:23.631 --> 04:26.061
I don't know, opportunity
to settle the score.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.866
It's... out of the question.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.739
I don't think you should make
that decision that quickly.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.298
Listen, it's always this way.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.906

08:01.982 --> 08:03.782
Just half a dozen
pieces that were left

08:03.784 --> 08:05.284

08:05.285 --> 08:08.115
They didn't even touch
the vault in the back.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.991
That doesn't make
any sense.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.520

Huh? Uh, Ada, kind of

08:24.505 --> 08:25.985
in the middle of something.
Uh-huh.

08:25.989 --> 08:27.469
So you know how I've been doing
following up on the apb calls,

08:27.474 --> 08:29.674
like, running stats
on victim outcomes,

08:29.676 --> 08:31.776
arrests, et cetera?
Yes, I remember.

08:31.778 --> 08:32.878
Could this wait, please?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.280
Okay. So, there
is a case in here

08:34.280 --> 08:35.451
that we really
need to deal with.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.979
It's one of the first users
of the app.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.654
This kid named marshawn Jackson,
a domestic violence call.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.022
Look at this.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.450
Hmm? What... what's...
What am I looking at?

08:42.456 --> 08:43.686
This is the kid's father.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.490
I ran a statistical
breakdown of the case.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.492
There have been ten calls
to this address since may.

08:47.494 --> 08:50.004
And if you factor in things
like gun ownership,

08:49.997 --> 08:51.227
uh, previous arrest records,

08:51.231 --> 08:54.201
multiple hospitalizations
for the wife and for marshawn,

08:54.201 --> 08:56.301
there's a 78% chance... hey!

08:56.303 --> 08:58.173
There's a 78% chance
that someone gets killed

08:58.171 --> 09:00.211
in that household
in the next six months.

09:00.207 --> 09:01.867
We have to do something!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.505
What? Do something like what?
I don't know.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.180
I'm an engineer, not a cop.
That's why I'm asking you.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.579
There's got to
be something...
Ada, I'm right in the middle

09:07.581 --> 09:09.251
of this shooting,
from last night.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.349
Yeah, I know!
But we're talking about

09:10.350 --> 09:12.180
an eleven-year-old kid, here.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.415
Gideon, that's how old I was
when I landed in foster care,

09:14.421 --> 09:16.091
which is exactly
where this kid is gonna end up

09:16.089 --> 09:18.159
if we don't do something.
Just look at the math.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.858
We can't arrest someone
based on math.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.190
Why not?

09:21.194 --> 09:22.994
Statistically speaking,
eyewitness testimony

09:22.996 --> 09:25.256
is less than 60% reliable
most of the time

09:25.265 --> 09:27.265
and people get arrested
based on that.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.367
My numbers are way better.

09:28.368 --> 09:31.368
Did you know that 75.6%
of statistics

09:31.371 --> 09:33.201
are made up on the spot.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.836
Only 23% of people
are actually aware of that.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.777
It is not police business

09:38.779 --> 09:41.349
if someone's <i> likely</i>
to do something.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.116
(Scoffs) Okay, fine.
Forget I said anything.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.787
(Groans)

09:49.456 --> 09:51.916
(Buzzer sounds)

10:02.936 --> 10:04.436
You want to go down
for this alone?

10:04.438 --> 10:06.738
Who said anyone's going down?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.470
You and your friends ran
from the cops.

10:09.643 --> 10:12.083
From the scene of a murder.
You got the wrong guy.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.909
We have video, kilton.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.984
James: <i> Yeah?</i>
Murphy: <i> Yeah.</i>

10:15.983 --> 10:17.983
<i>You got video of those guys in</i>
<i>masks runnin' out of the store?</i>

10:17.985 --> 10:20.545
Good for you.
That ain't video of me.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.324
Do you think, by ditching
your mask and gloves

10:22.322 --> 10:23.462
that you're protected?

10:23.457 --> 10:26.957
You drove away from the scene.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.430
Do you really think that
the jury is gonna believe...

10:29.429 --> 10:32.259
I think that a jury
will believe this:

10:32.265 --> 10:34.625
I saw some men
robbing a jewelry store.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.095
I got scared, so I ran,

10:36.103 --> 10:37.603
just like
anyone would.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.244
Conrad:
<i>He's not budging.</i>

10:39.239 --> 10:40.769
Damnedest part is, he's right.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.514
We don't have much of a case.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.109
I took a look at the evidence.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.181
We might be able to get
him on resisting arrest,

10:46.179 --> 10:47.449
maybe reckless driving.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.947
We must have video footage.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.279
Nothing that links him
directly to the crime.

10:51.284 --> 10:53.594
The getaway vehicles
were parked out of range

10:53.587 --> 10:55.347
of all the security cameras.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.085
All we can say for sure,

10:57.090 --> 10:59.690
is he was seen driving
a car away from the area.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.963
Murphy:
<i>You ran from the police.</i>

11:01.962 --> 11:04.032
How are you gonna explain that?

11:04.031 --> 11:05.831
They were screaming at me.

11:05.832 --> 11:09.102
You know, you hear
those horrible stories

11:09.102 --> 11:10.472
about the cops.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.140
I was afraid for my life.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.869
That's your story.

11:13.874 --> 11:17.184
No. That's the truth, detective.

11:18.712 --> 11:19.942
Gideon:
<i>What can we do here?</i>

11:19.946 --> 11:22.506
I wish I had
a better answer for you.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.546
Bottom line, if
we want anything,

11:25.552 --> 11:27.192
we're gonna have
to get it from him,

11:27.187 --> 11:28.647
and he's not talking.

11:28.655 --> 11:31.955
Well, then let's find a way
to make him sing like Adele.

11:31.958 --> 11:34.558
Streisand. No, Adele.
Let's go with Adele.

11:38.165 --> 11:41.395
(Buzzer sounds, door opens)
Hey.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.471
I was watching you
in there with kilton.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.500
Watching me fail?
Thanks.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.035
I promise, if I have
to tase his ass...

11:48.041 --> 11:49.571
All right, well,
before you do that,

11:49.576 --> 11:51.076
maybe I can help you.

11:51.078 --> 11:53.338
Gideon, you know how much
i appreciate

11:53.346 --> 11:54.506
everything that you do,

11:54.514 --> 11:57.424
but this--
interrogations--

11:57.417 --> 11:58.817
has nothing to do
with technology.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.020
Really? How do you know?

12:05.025 --> 12:07.055
It's sitting in a room,
getting inside a guy's head.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.890
Like a... like a chess match.

12:08.895 --> 12:11.195
Mm-hmm. Chess wasn't
about technology

12:11.198 --> 12:12.858
till a computer called deep blue

12:12.866 --> 12:15.426
beat garry Kasparov in 1997.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.365
But the computer couldn't
feel happy about it.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.370
It's about emotion--
guilt, anger, fear.

12:20.373 --> 12:22.773
Right, technology has
nothing to do with emotion?

12:22.776 --> 12:25.506
So you're not familiar
with the Internet then?

12:25.512 --> 12:26.952
Just because cops did
interrogations

12:26.947 --> 12:29.077
with a notebook and a metal
chair for a hundred years,

12:29.082 --> 12:31.182
that doesn't mean that
that's the best way.

12:31.184 --> 12:33.184
Just-just let me try.

12:33.186 --> 12:36.216
I might have an idea.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.223
Fine.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.955
But just know that
this matters to me.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.730
When I was a rookie,

12:41.728 --> 12:43.458
Linc took me
under his wing.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.463
He made sure that
the department cowboys

12:45.465 --> 12:47.395
didn't give me
too much hell.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.870
He was my friend.

12:48.869 --> 12:52.599
Yeah. I understand.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.536
I came to the 13th
'cause I lost a friend, too.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.984
So just...

12:59.980 --> 13:02.150
Just give me
a few hours.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.019
Please.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.816
Man:
<i>Gideon, as your chief counsel,</i>

13:08.822 --> 13:10.462
<i>I need to remind you</i>
<i>you're talking about</i>

13:10.457 --> 13:12.387
a $5 million piece
of equipment.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.332
Yes, I'm aware of that.
Thank you, my friend.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.727
If you recall, I'm the guy that
wrote the $5 million check.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.000
Come to think of it,

13:17.998 --> 13:19.798
I should have charged it
for the miles.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.630
This is a chair designed
for a shuttle cockpit.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.396
How does putting it
in a police station make it...

13:24.404 --> 13:27.144
See these? These are
biometric feedback sensors.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.280
They take ecg, eeg,
and eda readings

13:30.277 --> 13:32.337
to measure stress levels.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.505
In pilots, not criminals!

13:34.514 --> 13:36.684
Criminals are better
than pilots.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.523
That came out wrong.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.248
My point is, criminals are
trying to hide their stress.

13:41.254 --> 13:45.494
So if it works on them, it's
gonna work on anyone, right?

13:45.492 --> 13:47.362
In theory, maybe.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.330
Yes, in theory, maybe.
Thank you.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.759
And all we've got to do
is test that theory.

13:50.764 --> 13:52.034
I'm glad you agree.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.832
Guys, could we
box that up for me?

13:53.834 --> 13:56.534
I'm on a very
tight schedule.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.768
Man (Shouting):
What the hell?!

14:02.776 --> 14:04.206
Woman, how many times
i gotta tell you?!

14:04.211 --> 14:05.541
Woman:
I did what you
asked already!

14:05.545 --> 14:06.845
Why are you always
yelling at me?!

14:06.847 --> 14:08.177
Man:
Well, if you did what
i said the first time,

14:08.181 --> 14:09.851
we wouldn't be having
this conversation!

14:09.850 --> 14:11.350
Woman:
I did what you said
the first time!

14:11.351 --> 14:12.681
Maybe you need to get
your ears checked!

14:14.154 --> 14:15.394
Can I help you?

14:15.388 --> 14:17.658
Yeah, I'm with
the Chicago p.D.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.117
I actually wanted
to talk to you about...
Man: Who's that?

14:19.125 --> 14:21.355
Nobody!

14:21.361 --> 14:22.691
Look, this ain't a good time.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.996
Well, actually, you know,
it's really important.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.728
No, please, I can't
talk right now.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.233
Okay, wait...

14:28.235 --> 14:29.625
Man:
What the hell was that?!

14:29.636 --> 14:31.396
Woman:
No one. Just calm down.

14:31.404 --> 14:34.444
Man:
Woman, shut your mouth!

14:36.543 --> 14:39.643
Hey, hey,
you're-you're marshawn, right?

14:39.646 --> 14:41.746
You with the police?

14:42.849 --> 14:45.849
Uh, yeah, kind of.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.852
Um, I just wanted
to check up on you.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.594
Yeah, whatever.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.989
Wait. What is that
supposed to mean?

14:52.993 --> 14:56.263
Last time I called y'all,
y'all arrested my pops.

14:56.263 --> 14:57.463
Two days later he's back.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.332
Ain't no use...

15:00.333 --> 15:02.033
(Crashing)
Man:
Where the hell's marshawn, huh?!

15:02.035 --> 15:03.565
Tell him to get
his ass in here!

15:03.570 --> 15:05.040
Woman:
I told you already,
he's on his way.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.908
Wait, you can't...

15:14.347 --> 15:15.907
(Door opens)
- Man:
Boy, where you been?!

15:15.916 --> 15:17.216
Didn't I tell you to get
your ass home two hours ago?!

15:17.217 --> 15:18.377
Woman:
Don't yell at him.

Murphy:
Go. I'm listening.

15:37.537 --> 15:40.737
It's the same damn story
that I told you before.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.210
Murphy (Over speaker):
<i>Well, I want you</i>

15:43.209 --> 15:45.939
Conrad: How does this
work, exactly?

15:45.946 --> 15:48.646
Gideon: I call it
"upgraded interrogation."

15:48.648 --> 15:51.418
Sensors in my secret
special fancy chair

15:51.418 --> 15:53.378
monitor his stress levels.

15:53.386 --> 15:56.546
So if she hits a nerve,
if she asks him something

15:56.556 --> 15:58.886
that's got him worried,
we'll know.

15:58.892 --> 16:00.992
Conrad: And she can
hear you with that earpiece?

16:00.994 --> 16:02.894
Gideon: Just like
an air traffic controller.

16:02.896 --> 16:05.326
Now, let's see if we can't
wreck this guy's plane.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.662
Murphy: <i> I pulled your</i>

16:08.168 --> 16:09.628
You bounced around a lot
the last few years.

16:09.636 --> 16:12.236
Is there some kind of law
against that?

16:12.238 --> 16:14.568
No, I'm just saying.

Whoa.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.320
Murphy, he got jumpy

16:26.319 --> 16:27.989
when you mentioned
back of the yards.

Gideon (Over earpiece):

16:31.791 --> 16:33.491
You know, I've lived all around.

James, you and I both know

<i>And here's something else</i>

17:07.327 --> 17:08.857

17:13.366 --> 17:15.165
Yes, keep going. He's worried.
(Computer beeping)

17:15.167 --> 17:17.598
I want to know
<i>why</i> you were there.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.640
Because it seems to me
that it could be a few things.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.842
Maybe somebody wanted
to settle a score

17:23.843 --> 17:26.813
<i>with Linc for his cop days.</i>

17:26.813 --> 17:28.953
<i>Or maybe there this beef with</i>

17:30.717 --> 17:34.087
Or maybe, this wasn't even
the real heist.

17:36.990 --> 17:40.360
Maybe... this was just a setup
for something else.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.990

<i>You need to see this now.</i>

17:53.173 --> 17:54.413
We're definitely
getting to him.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.007
He's more stressed than o.J.

17:56.009 --> 17:57.709
When he tried on
the glove.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.710
They are definitely
planning something.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.052
Even if he is,
we don't know

18:01.047 --> 18:02.707
what it is, we don't
know where it is,

18:02.715 --> 18:04.045
and we don't know
when it is.

18:04.050 --> 18:06.250
We still don't know anything.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.352
I'm close.
I can feel it.

18:08.354 --> 18:10.564
We can't get a conviction
based on a feeling.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.057
If we want to do
something with this,

18:12.058 --> 18:13.958
we need a confession.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.060
He's talking to us
because he thinks

18:15.061 --> 18:16.431
he's running us in circles.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.199
If we push further,
he's gonna lawyer up,

18:18.198 --> 18:19.428
and then we've got nothing.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.232
Then tell me how we get
from feelings

18:21.234 --> 18:22.474

All right,
wait, wait, wait.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.112
Okay, okay, okay.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.607
So we know they're
planning something.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.539
We know James is nervous
about back of the yards.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.245
But back of the yards
is a big place.

18:34.247 --> 18:37.077
Right. We need to
make it smaller, right?

18:37.083 --> 18:40.223
So you go in there and you
start talking neighborhoods,

18:40.220 --> 18:42.550
different areas,
different corners,

18:42.555 --> 18:43.915
we might be able
to get a better idea

18:43.923 --> 18:45.163
of what he's worried about.

18:45.158 --> 18:47.388
How soon can we get goss
and Brandt out in the field?

18:47.393 --> 18:48.593
Right away.
They're on patrol.

18:48.595 --> 18:50.325
But, Gideon, even if
you narrow down the area,

18:50.330 --> 18:52.300
we still don't know
what we're looking for.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.968
(Chuckles)

18:53.967 --> 18:55.667
I know that,
you know that,

18:55.668 --> 18:57.568
but he doesn't know that.

18:57.570 --> 19:00.970
All right, all right,
the interrogation room

19:00.974 --> 19:04.344
needs, like, screens
for live video.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.444
Ada, can you...
That's... where...

19:06.446 --> 19:08.246
Where the hell is Ada?

19:44.450 --> 19:46.550
(Computer beeps)

19:46.553 --> 19:48.893
<i>Been a while.</i>

19:48.888 --> 19:50.388
<i>Thought you were 5-o now.</i>

19:51.891 --> 19:54.631
Not exactly.
We have our differences.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.027
<i>Interesting.</i>

19:56.029 --> 19:57.829
<i>Tell me more.</i>

19:57.830 --> 19:59.360
I need some
digital justice.

19:59.365 --> 20:02.395
I need you to
shut someone down.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.832
All the way down.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.996
<i>Okay. And...</i>

20:06.005 --> 20:07.605
<i>What are you gonna do for me?</i>

20:09.742 --> 20:11.612
I guess I'll owe you a favor.

20:13.079 --> 20:15.679
<i>A favor?</i>

20:15.682 --> 20:16.752
Yeah.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.449
<i>All right, send me the info.</i>

20:23.556 --> 20:24.886
(Sighs)

20:27.160 --> 20:30.330
(Indistinct radio transmission)

20:30.330 --> 20:33.330
1305, squad, we are in
back of the yards,

20:33.333 --> 20:34.703
as instructed.

20:34.701 --> 20:36.171
You want to tell us
what we're doing here?

20:36.169 --> 20:39.099
We are interrogating
James kilton.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.705
<i>He doesn't want us poking</i>
<i>around</i>

20:40.707 --> 20:43.207
<i>his old neighborhood,</i>
<i>so that's what you're doing.</i>

20:43.209 --> 20:47.139
<i>You'll be on live video, so,</i>
<i>you know, keep your clothes on.</i>

20:52.118 --> 20:53.448
Tech (Over intercom):
<i>Mr. Reeves,</i>

20:53.453 --> 20:54.753
<i>the video wall is</i>
<i>up and running.</i>

20:54.754 --> 20:57.624
Murphy, all right.

20:57.624 --> 20:59.594
We're live.

20:59.592 --> 21:02.792
Gideon:
<i>Feeding video to you now.</i>

21:04.030 --> 21:05.500
Just a few more questions.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.103
What's this?
We watching TV now?

21:09.102 --> 21:10.802
What, that?

21:10.803 --> 21:12.073
I just thought
you wanted to see

21:12.071 --> 21:13.201
how the investigation
was going.

21:19.412 --> 21:23.452
Got a source that says you've
been spending some time there.

21:23.449 --> 21:26.779
<i>Yeah? Who's your source?</i>

21:26.786 --> 21:28.216
Oh, nice, murph.

21:28.221 --> 21:30.051
His heart rate just went
through the roof.

21:30.056 --> 21:33.816
I can't kiss and tell,
now, can I?

21:33.826 --> 21:36.886
Let's just say the source
is real close to you.

21:40.099 --> 21:41.429
<i>Hey, I told you...</i>

21:41.434 --> 21:42.674
Murphy: <i> I know,</i>
<i>you weren't involved.</i>

21:42.669 --> 21:44.899
<i>You've got nothing to say.</i>
<i>Look, here's the thing.</i>

21:44.904 --> 21:46.274
<i>I don't need you to talk.</i>

21:46.272 --> 21:48.142
My source has given me
all that I need.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.253
Whoa, no, no, no, no,
we're losing him.

21:59.252 --> 22:01.992
It's just... when his
stress levels were spiking,

22:01.988 --> 22:02.988
where was he?

22:02.989 --> 22:03.989
Whiskey row.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.360
Oh, I like
the sound of that.

22:05.358 --> 22:08.088
1305, head back
to whiskey row.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.034
Coming back around.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.614
To hell with this.
Hey, sit down.

22:23.609 --> 22:25.639
Whoa, what's it...
No, murph!

22:25.645 --> 22:26.935
You gotta get him
back in the chair.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.206
You know, I don't really feel
like sittin' right now.

22:28.214 --> 22:29.784
I don't feel like
doing any of this.
- No?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.652
Do you feel like spending
the night in lockup?

22:31.651 --> 22:33.021
'Cause if you don't sit
your ass down right now,

22:33.019 --> 22:34.189
I'm gonna throw you in a cell,

22:34.187 --> 22:35.517
you're gonna have to wait
until you see a judge

22:35.521 --> 22:37.221
and pony up bail.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.929
Sit down.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.732
You ain't got nothin'
on me, detective.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.995
And we're back.
Nice work, Murphy.

22:51.003 --> 22:54.213
Okay, gettin' warmer.
Just keep him in that chair.

22:54.207 --> 22:55.707
There's duct tape
in the supply room

22:55.708 --> 22:58.738
<i>if you need it.</i>

22:58.745 --> 23:02.805
Hey, squad, there's a,
uh, long-term parking lot

23:02.815 --> 23:04.375
just around the corner.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.424
Had some calls about
some auto thefts there.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.649
I'm thinking that's where
our bad guys got their rides.

23:10.323 --> 23:13.663
That's a good thought, 1305.
Check into that.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.529
Brandt: <i> What do you want us</i>
<i>to do when we get there?</i>

23:15.528 --> 23:17.158
Gideon:
<i>Uh, just find a security guard,</i>

23:17.163 --> 23:18.333
<i>talk about the weather.</i>

23:18.331 --> 23:19.601
<i>We just need the video</i>

23:19.599 --> 23:22.599
<i>to convince James</i>
<i>we're getting close.</i>

23:22.602 --> 23:25.772
Goss: <i> 1305, squad, arriving at</i>
<i>parking lot now.</i>

23:31.010 --> 23:33.910
Oh, damn, looks like
Brandt's onto something.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.353
James sure thinks so.

23:35.348 --> 23:37.478
He is nervous
about that lot, murph.

23:38.418 --> 23:41.418
James... if you talk to us,

23:41.421 --> 23:42.751
if you help us,

23:42.755 --> 23:44.045
we can cut you a deal.

23:44.056 --> 23:46.586
(Chuckles)
Get out of here.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.592
If we crack this case without
you, the deal's off the table.

23:52.899 --> 23:55.269
Murphy:
Recognize that car lot?

23:55.268 --> 23:56.598
You do, don't you?

23:56.602 --> 23:58.102
We link you to the car,

23:58.104 --> 24:00.404
we link you to the robbery,
then you go down for murder.

24:00.406 --> 24:04.236
I don't need no deal, detective.

24:04.243 --> 24:06.383
Murphy:
Look at that screen.

24:06.379 --> 24:07.709
Do you think those cops

24:07.713 --> 24:09.983
are talking to that guard
for no reason?

24:11.984 --> 24:16.024
Fine, if that's the way
you want it, good luck in trial.

24:19.292 --> 24:22.292
(Beeping gets faster)

24:26.899 --> 24:28.469
Wait!

24:33.339 --> 24:35.369
All right!
All right.

24:39.345 --> 24:41.845
I'll tell you
what you want to know...

24:41.848 --> 24:44.518
But I want a deal, you got me?

24:44.517 --> 24:47.317
<i>I want a deal right now.</i>

24:50.089 --> 24:51.659
I think we can
work something out.

24:51.657 --> 24:54.587
And that, ladies and gentlemen,

24:54.594 --> 24:56.734
is how you engineer
a confession. Yes, yes, yes.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.502
You've worked
with this crew before?

25:01.501 --> 25:03.531
James: We all used to work
security in Indiana.

25:03.536 --> 25:06.336
Sutter, there, at the top?
He put it together.

25:06.339 --> 25:09.609
The jewelry wholesaler,
he wasn't the real target.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.379
Nah, it's just the first step.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.177
Real target's
some armored truck.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.779
<i>We hit the wholesaler</i>
<i>to get the schedules.</i>

25:15.781 --> 25:17.981
<i>The plan was, me and Adam,</i>
<i>we were gonna be the drivers.</i>

25:17.984 --> 25:20.154
Sutter, he was supposed
to blow the truck open.

25:20.152 --> 25:21.992
Now, len, len's job was
to take out the guards

25:21.988 --> 25:23.348
and get the money.

25:23.356 --> 25:25.616
When? When was all
this gonna happen?

25:25.625 --> 25:28.055
I don't know. We were supposed
to skip town at sunset, so...

25:28.060 --> 25:30.290
(Exhales loudly)
...Late this afternoon?

25:30.296 --> 25:32.396
Today? Gideon.

25:32.398 --> 25:34.128
Guess we're working
through lunch.

25:34.133 --> 25:37.233
Gideon: <i> Murphy, we need</i>
<i>more info, now.</i>

25:37.236 --> 25:40.536
James, we need to know
what truck.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.210
I don't know.
That wasn't my end.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.568
Sutter, he took
care of all that.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.536
Talking about two
or three hundred trucks.

25:45.545 --> 25:48.875
If you want this deal,
we need to know everything.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.251
I'm telling you,
i don't know.

25:51.250 --> 25:54.180
Look, you guys, you picked me up
before I got the whole plan.

25:54.186 --> 25:56.386
Look, all I know
is that we were setting up

25:56.389 --> 25:57.589
at an apartment
on Kendall street.

25:57.590 --> 25:58.820
What's the address?

25:58.824 --> 26:00.564
What do you need that for, huh?

26:00.560 --> 26:01.760
You already got
that guy talking.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.661
You-you got, you got those cops.

26:07.767 --> 26:10.227
Oh, wait.
No, no, no, no, come on.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.096
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>
<i>You lied to me.</i>

26:12.104 --> 26:14.744
<i>You didn't have nobody,</i>
<i>did you?</i>

26:14.740 --> 26:17.110
Nope...

26:17.109 --> 26:18.239
But we've got you now.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.844
You're in, James.

26:20.846 --> 26:22.846
You and your loser friends
are done.

26:22.848 --> 26:24.918
You know, you think you're
so much better than us, huh?

26:24.917 --> 26:28.287
We were making ten bucks
an hour, no benefits,

26:28.287 --> 26:29.787
carrying around
millions of dollars

26:29.789 --> 26:31.559
for rich fat cats
like your boss.

26:31.557 --> 26:33.757
All we were doing
was evening the score.

26:33.759 --> 26:37.599
Linc Richards was one of you,
you pathetic son of a bitch!

26:37.597 --> 26:41.067
You killed a good man
in cold blood.

26:41.067 --> 26:43.267
Those armored
truck companies,

26:43.269 --> 26:45.599
they're based out of Texas,

26:45.605 --> 26:47.365
which means we can
try you there.

26:47.373 --> 26:50.113
<i>Number one death penalty state</i>
<i>in the nation.</i>

26:50.109 --> 26:52.209
You don't talk?

26:52.211 --> 26:55.481
You'll wind up in the gas
chamber for killing my friend.

26:59.552 --> 27:00.722
Can she do that?

27:00.720 --> 27:03.550
Nope... but he sure
thinks she can.

27:05.224 --> 27:06.994
I want her
at my next poker game.

27:06.993 --> 27:08.633
Murphy:
<i>What's the address?</i>

27:08.628 --> 27:11.498
Give me the address now!

27:11.497 --> 27:13.297
833 Kendall street!

27:14.166 --> 27:16.666
That's all I know!

27:16.669 --> 27:19.569
We need to get a tact team
in the field.

27:19.572 --> 27:21.312
If we don't get 'em now,
we won't have another chance.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.437
Already on it.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.441
Sorry for getting
agro in there.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.613
No, no, no,
no apologies necessary.

27:26.612 --> 27:28.982
Just, uh, don't ever
get mad at me.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.651
All right,
let's get the drone in the air.

27:30.650 --> 27:31.650
Ada, could y...

27:31.651 --> 27:32.951
Damn it!

27:32.952 --> 27:34.922
Has anybody seen Ada?

27:34.920 --> 27:36.450
Yo, get back!
Hold on, man.

27:36.455 --> 27:39.255
I don't need to be
holding onto nothing, man.

27:39.258 --> 27:40.488
Come on. Let's just play.

27:40.493 --> 27:41.563
Don't want to be like you.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.999
(Phone beeps quietly)

27:52.004 --> 27:54.274
What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

27:54.273 --> 27:55.713
A pack of them menthols.

27:55.708 --> 27:57.168
(Sniffs, clears throat)

28:03.783 --> 28:05.223
(Card reader beeps)

28:06.786 --> 28:08.116
Says I got to take the card.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.220
Man, what you
talking about?

28:09.221 --> 28:10.221
Man, I just used
the damn card.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.792
Well, hold-hold on,
man, what you doing?

28:12.792 --> 28:14.462
Yo, it's a mistake!

28:14.460 --> 28:15.790
Yo, that's my card, man!

28:15.795 --> 28:16.955
Sorry, man.

28:16.962 --> 28:18.802
You got cash?
- What...

28:18.798 --> 28:20.528
No, I ain't got no cash!
That's why I had the damn card!

28:20.533 --> 28:22.073
(Laughs)

28:23.502 --> 28:24.642
What? Something funny?

28:24.637 --> 28:28.007
Yeah, I don't know.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.367
Sweaty loser who can't
afford cigarettes.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.235
It's pretty funny to me.

28:31.243 --> 28:34.143
You know, you sure got a mouth
on you, don't you, girl?

28:34.146 --> 28:35.706
I suggest you shut it.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.645
Or what?
You want to shut it for me?

28:37.650 --> 28:39.580
Bitch, if you don't get out
my face right now I just might.

28:39.585 --> 28:40.715
Clerk: Hey.
- Why don't you try
something, big guy?

28:40.720 --> 28:43.150
Better back off,
that's all I'm saying.

28:43.155 --> 28:44.715
You like hitting girls,
don't you?

28:46.492 --> 28:49.162
You like hitting girls.
You like hitting kids.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.301
Girls and kids. What's better?

28:52.732 --> 28:54.602
Probably doesn't matter,
as long as they're small, huh?

28:54.600 --> 28:58.370
Clerk: Hey!
You like that, bitch, huh?

28:58.370 --> 29:00.340

clarified, I hated my dad,

32:15.467 --> 32:18.097
Exactly.
Take a look.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.603
So I've modeled the bomb

32:19.605 --> 32:21.635
based on the information
we've gathered,

32:21.640 --> 32:23.310
and according to the

32:23.309 --> 32:24.369
it's full of det. Chord.

Plastic explosives.

32:25.878 --> 32:28.278
That's enough firepower
to bring down a building.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.750
If they put this
in an armored car,

32:29.748 --> 32:31.048
it's gonna kill
everybody inside.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.980
Pete: My best guess is
they're gonna trigger it

32:32.985 --> 32:34.785
with a burner phone,
like an ied.

32:34.787 --> 32:36.247
Can we trace it?
- Tried.

32:36.255 --> 32:37.645
They're not on yet.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.556
Chances are they're gonna
power them up at the scene

32:39.558 --> 32:40.718

32:40.726 --> 32:43.056

Mm-hmm.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.672
Just have a little faith.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.113
So,

32:56.108 --> 32:58.508
we figured since they
are using a physical map,

32:58.510 --> 32:59.980
they'd probably
be touching it.

32:59.979 --> 33:01.949
And though we didn't find

33:01.947 --> 33:04.147
