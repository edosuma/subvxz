10:38.333 --> 10:41.458
On a scale of one to French,
how do I look today?

10:41.542 --> 10:42.917
Oh, pardonnez-moi.

10:43.000 --> 10:46.166
I didn't realize you were
guiding the young mademoiselles.

10:47.709 --> 10:50.125
Francine,
do you know that dweeb?

10:50.208 --> 10:53.709
H-He's my...friend
Stan's kid.

10:53.792 --> 10:57.125
Like, 10 years ago,
he drew a picture of me,

10:57.208 --> 11:01.250
and it was, like, a circle
on top of a triangle.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.917
It's like,
"Uh...thanks?"

11:05.959 --> 11:09.875
Okay, you're kind of
my favorite person right now.

11:09.959 --> 11:11.250
Guys...

11:14.750 --> 11:16.875
So, we never
do this, but...

11:16.959 --> 11:18.250
do you want
to come hang out

11:18.333 --> 11:20.583
at Blanche's dad's lake house
this weekend?

11:20.667 --> 11:22.291
My boyfriend
drowned there last summer,

11:22.375 --> 11:25.333
so the cops let us
drive around doing whip-its.

11:25.417 --> 11:27.208
That sounds
like a blast!

11:27.291 --> 11:29.792
Okay, don't pee yourself
over it.

like a field trip?

you're allowed

11:39.667 --> 11:40.875

with the students.

11:40.959 --> 11:42.542
What are you,
the rule book?

11:42.625 --> 11:44.625
It just seems like
you're always with them.

11:44.709 --> 11:48.083
Uh, yeah.
We go to the same school.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.583
But I go
to that school,

11:49.667 --> 11:52.625

to me in the hall.

11:52.709 --> 11:54.750

with them for you.

11:54.834 --> 11:56.792
Oh, mon dieu!

11:56.875 --> 11:59.333
You're getting them to come
to my fashion show!

11:59.417 --> 12:02.875
Wha? They'd never
go to that...

12:02.959 --> 12:05.500
without your mother going
to the lake house

12:05.583 --> 12:07.250
and talking them
into it!

12:07.333 --> 12:08.875
Thank you, Mom!

Okay, don't pee yourself
over it.

different about Francine?

12:15.458 --> 12:17.959
She seems cooler
somehow.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.333
Wake up, bro.

12:19.417 --> 12:21.750
Francine is, like,
the coolest girl in school.

12:21.834 --> 12:25.125
She will be mine.

12:25.208 --> 12:29.834
All I have to do is figure out
where Steve goes to school.

12:32.375 --> 12:35.667
The moon
looks so stupid up close.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.166
Get away from me.

12:37.250 --> 12:40.000
Sometimes I wish the moon
drowned in that lake

12:40.083 --> 12:41.458
instead of Austin.

12:41.542 --> 12:44.000
Hey, Francine, why aren't you
making fun of the moon?

12:44.083 --> 12:45.250
Sorry, guys.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.583
I guess I'm just
thinking about something.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.125
Oh, no.
Why?

12:50.208 --> 12:52.166
I promised
one of the students

12:52.250 --> 12:54.792
I'd go
to his stupid fashion show.

12:54.875 --> 12:58.125
Oh! You know what
would be hilarious?

12:58.208 --> 12:59.500
Like,
if we all had sex

12:59.583 --> 13:02.125
with that cop who looks
like my step-dad?

13:02.208 --> 13:03.333
Uh...

13:03.417 --> 13:05.250
I was thinking more like

13:05.333 --> 13:08.583
we go to the fashion show
and clap,

13:08.667 --> 13:12.041
but our secret joke --
never to be revealed --

13:12.125 --> 13:16.417
would be that
we thought it was stupid.

13:17.709 --> 13:18.750
Like the moon.

13:18.834 --> 13:20.834
Oh, yeah, totally.
Dumb moon.

is such a Debbie.

bitches?
