00:02.250 --> 00:05.875
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

00:02.250 --> 00:05.875
<i>Stardate 41463.9:</i>

00:05.875 --> 00:07.709
<i>While mapping</i>

00:05.875 --> 00:07.709
<i>the Pleiades Cluster,</i>

00:07.709 --> 00:09.291
<i>we've been asked</i>

00:07.709 --> 00:09.291
<i>by the Federation</i>

00:09.291 --> 00:12.208
<i>to visit a group</i>

00:09.291 --> 00:12.208
<i>terraforming Velara III.</i>

00:12.208 --> 00:13.917
<i>Communications</i>

00:12.208 --> 00:13.917
<i>have been erratic,</i>

00:13.917 --> 00:16.500
<i>and there is some concern</i>

00:13.917 --> 00:16.500
<i>about their welfare.</i>

00:16.500 --> 00:18.375
Entering

00:16.500 --> 00:18.375
standard orbit...

00:18.375 --> 00:20.000
now.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.125
It takes very special people

00:20.000 --> 00:22.125
to live in such desolation.

00:22.125 --> 00:23.834
Visionaries who don't see

00:22.125 --> 00:23.834
the planet as it is

00:23.834 --> 00:25.333
but as it will be.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.709
I've always wanted

00:25.333 --> 00:27.709
to see terraforming

00:25.333 --> 00:27.709
in operation.

00:27.709 --> 00:29.667
Lieutenant Yar.

00:27.709 --> 00:29.667
Hailing frequencies.

00:29.667 --> 00:31.417
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

00:31.417 --> 00:32.959
Velara III base,

00:32.959 --> 00:36.291
this is Captain Picard

00:32.959 --> 00:36.291
of the Starship<i> Enterprise.</i>

00:46.625 --> 00:48.750
No malfunctioning equipment

00:46.625 --> 00:48.750
on either side, sir.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.000
They are receiving us.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.667
Velara III base,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.667
this is the<i> Enterprise.</i>

00:51.667 --> 00:53.417
Come in please. Over.

00:55.709 --> 00:58.125
Maybe no one's home.

01:01.417 --> 01:03.709
We are sensing life-forms, sir.

01:04.834 --> 01:07.542
Velara III base, do you copy?

01:07.542 --> 01:11.083
Velara base to<i> Enterprise.</i>

01:11.083 --> 01:13.667
Yes, Captain.

01:11.083 --> 01:13.667
I'm Director Mandl,

01:13.667 --> 01:15.917
and I'm sorry about the delay,

01:15.917 --> 01:19.208
but we weren't

01:15.917 --> 01:19.208
expecting visitors.

01:19.208 --> 01:21.500
Terraform Command has asked us

01:21.500 --> 01:23.667
to see how you were

01:21.500 --> 01:23.667
getting along.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.625
We were a little behind,

01:23.667 --> 01:26.625
but we're back on schedule,

01:26.625 --> 01:27.959
and I'd like to hope

01:27.959 --> 01:31.375
we'd be allowed

01:27.959 --> 01:31.375
to maintain that schedule.

01:31.375 --> 01:34.333
We alarm him

01:31.375 --> 01:34.333
for some reason.

01:36.083 --> 01:38.959
Your staff are all well,

01:36.083 --> 01:38.959
I presume, Director.

01:38.959 --> 01:40.542
Understandably tired.

01:40.542 --> 01:43.000
We're working very hard,

01:40.542 --> 01:43.000
Captain.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.917
Well, if there is anything

01:43.000 --> 01:45.917
that we can do to help...

01:45.917 --> 01:47.583
you and your staff

01:45.917 --> 01:47.583
are very welcome aboard

01:47.583 --> 01:49.458
for a change

01:47.583 --> 01:49.458
of scene, rest.

01:49.458 --> 01:51.500
We have some holodecks

01:49.458 --> 01:51.500
which you might enjoy.

01:51.500 --> 01:53.083
No disrespect, sir,

01:53.083 --> 01:55.667
but we cannot afford the time.

01:57.166 --> 01:58.333
COMPUTER:

01:57.166 --> 01:58.333
Channel closed.

01:58.333 --> 02:00.041
His fear is escalating.

02:00.041 --> 02:03.375
If you'll excuse me, sir, I...

02:00.041 --> 02:03.375
I really must get back to work.

02:03.375 --> 02:05.417
I sense deliberate

02:03.375 --> 02:05.417
concealment, sir.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.542
Of what?

02:06.542 --> 02:08.959
I don't know,

02:06.542 --> 02:08.959
but it's intense.

02:10.375 --> 02:11.750
Director Mandl, we've heard

02:11.750 --> 02:14.709
of your remarkable achievements

02:11.750 --> 02:14.709
in terraforming.

02:14.709 --> 02:17.000
My crew would very much

02:14.709 --> 02:17.000
appreciate looking around.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.500
This is not really

02:17.000 --> 02:19.500
the best time.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.750
We're at a very critical phase

02:19.500 --> 02:22.750
just now.

02:22.750 --> 02:24.792
We would require

02:22.750 --> 02:24.792
no special attention.

02:24.792 --> 02:26.834
I'm trying not to be rude, sir,

02:26.834 --> 02:31.333
but this is really

02:26.834 --> 02:31.333
very inconvenient.

02:32.542 --> 02:34.125
He<i> is</i> concealing something.

02:34.125 --> 02:36.792
It's more than

02:34.125 --> 02:36.792
just being too busy.

02:36.792 --> 02:38.583
Your announcement

02:36.792 --> 02:38.583
about coming down

02:38.583 --> 02:41.417
has sent him almost

02:38.583 --> 02:41.417
to a point of panic.

02:41.417 --> 02:44.750
Well, whether he wants us

02:41.417 --> 02:44.750
or not...

02:44.750 --> 02:46.208
Director Mandl,

02:46.208 --> 02:48.583
unless you're absolutely

02:46.208 --> 02:48.583
refusing us permission

02:48.583 --> 02:50.291
to land at your station,

02:50.291 --> 02:53.542
prepare to receive

02:50.291 --> 02:53.542
our away team.

02:53.542 --> 02:55.375
As you wish.

02:58.875 --> 03:00.917
Counselor, perhaps

02:58.875 --> 03:00.917
you'd better go along as well.

03:00.917 --> 03:02.291
Aye, sir.

03:02.291 --> 03:04.166
Someone that tense

03:02.291 --> 03:04.166
can be very unpredictable.

03:04.166 --> 03:06.417
Stay on your toes,

03:04.166 --> 03:06.417
Number One.

03:32.542 --> 03:37.208
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

03:37.208 --> 03:41.417
<i>These are the voyages</i>

03:37.208 --> 03:41.417
<i>of the Starship</i> Enterprise.

03:41.417 --> 03:43.000
<i>Its continuing mission--</i>

03:43.000 --> 03:47.083
<i>to explore</i>

03:43.000 --> 03:47.083
<i>strange new worlds,</i>

03:47.083 --> 03:51.625
<i>to seek out new life</i>

03:47.083 --> 03:51.625
<i>and new civilizations,</i>

03:51.625 --> 03:55.792
<i>to boldly go</i>

03:51.625 --> 03:55.792
<i>where no one has gone before.</i>

05:14.000 --> 05:15.959
Welcome to Velara III.

05:15.959 --> 05:17.000
Please.

05:19.208 --> 05:21.375
I want you to remember it

05:19.208 --> 05:21.375
as it is now

05:21.375 --> 05:25.709
because in a couple of decades,

05:21.375 --> 05:25.709
you won't recognize it.

05:25.709 --> 05:29.250
Luisa Kim,

05:25.709 --> 05:29.250
gardener of Edens.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.917
Commander William Riker,

05:29.250 --> 05:31.917
USS<i> Enterprise.</i>

05:31.917 --> 05:34.041
This is Counselor Troi,

05:31.917 --> 05:34.041
Lieutenant Yar,

05:34.041 --> 05:37.208
Lieutenant La Forge,

05:34.041 --> 05:37.208
Lieutenant Commander Data.

05:37.208 --> 05:39.667
Arthur Malencon,

05:37.208 --> 05:39.667
hydraulics specialist

05:39.667 --> 05:42.542
and Bjorn Bensen,

05:39.667 --> 05:42.542
chief engineer.

05:44.166 --> 05:45.667
An android?

05:45.667 --> 05:48.625
And third in command

05:45.667 --> 05:48.625
of the<i> Enterprise.</i>

05:48.625 --> 05:50.709
Where were you

05:48.625 --> 05:50.709
manufactured?

05:50.709 --> 05:52.583
Are there others

05:50.709 --> 05:52.583
like you?

05:52.583 --> 05:56.875
Both matters are subjects

05:52.583 --> 05:56.875
of protracted discussion.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.917
Remarkable.

05:58.917 --> 06:00.959
Excuse me.

06:04.709 --> 06:06.375
KIM:

06:04.709 --> 06:06.375
We don't get

06:04.709 --> 06:06.375
many visitors.

06:06.375 --> 06:08.458
It's exciting

06:06.375 --> 06:08.458
to have you here.

06:08.458 --> 06:11.375
We weren't sure

06:08.458 --> 06:11.375
how we would be received.

06:11.375 --> 06:15.500
Director Mandl was less than

06:11.375 --> 06:15.500
enthusiastic about our interest.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.750
I should apologize for him.

06:15.500 --> 06:19.750
We are at a critical phase.

06:19.750 --> 06:21.291
Usually, he's quite charming.

06:21.291 --> 06:22.875
We'll try to stay

06:21.291 --> 06:22.875
out of the way.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.333
We've never seen

06:22.875 --> 06:24.333
a terraforming station,

06:24.333 --> 06:28.000
and we appreciate

06:24.333 --> 06:28.000
the opportunity.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.083
How much do you know

06:28.000 --> 06:30.083
about the process?

06:30.083 --> 06:33.250
Theories, reports,

06:30.083 --> 06:33.250
but nothing firsthand.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.875
Oh, wonderful.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.875
Let me show you what we do.

06:35.875 --> 06:37.667
Newcomers find

06:35.875 --> 06:37.667
this imager helpful.

06:37.667 --> 06:38.834
The other two

06:37.667 --> 06:38.834
are secretive,

06:38.834 --> 06:41.083
but she is as open

06:38.834 --> 06:41.083
as she appears.

06:41.083 --> 06:44.208
What we're doing is

06:41.083 --> 06:44.208
so exciting, so inspiring.

06:44.208 --> 06:46.125
We take a lifeless planet

06:46.125 --> 06:47.750
and little by little

06:47.750 --> 06:49.959
transform it

06:47.750 --> 06:49.959
to an M-Class environment

06:49.959 --> 06:53.333
capable of supporting life.

06:53.333 --> 06:57.542
Terraforming makes you

06:53.333 --> 06:57.542
feel a little godlike.

06:57.542 --> 07:00.959
The first phase involves

06:57.542 --> 07:00.959
selecting the planet.

07:00.959 --> 07:02.583
That's very important.

07:02.583 --> 07:05.583
It must have

07:02.583 --> 07:05.583
the right mass and gravity,

07:05.583 --> 07:07.667
a correct rate of rotation,

07:07.667 --> 07:09.542
and a balanced

07:07.667 --> 07:09.542
day and night.

07:09.542 --> 07:12.083
The planet must also

07:09.542 --> 07:12.083
be without life

07:12.083 --> 07:14.792
or the prospect of life

07:12.083 --> 07:14.792
developing naturally.

07:14.792 --> 07:17.250
The Federation

07:14.792 --> 07:17.250
determines if that's so.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.375
Then, we take over.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.625
This station is Phase 2.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.542
Phase 3 involves water.

07:26.542 --> 07:29.917
Usually we create basins

07:26.542 --> 07:29.917
using hydraulic landscaping,

07:29.917 --> 07:32.792
but the water on this planet

07:29.917 --> 07:32.792
is subsurface

07:32.792 --> 07:35.291
and extremely high

07:32.792 --> 07:35.291
in salt content.

07:35.291 --> 07:39.333
We're just about to begin

07:35.291 --> 07:39.333
pumping and filtering the water,

07:39.333 --> 07:43.458
removing the salt,

07:39.333 --> 07:43.458
oxygenating and replacing.

07:43.458 --> 07:49.000
Next, we introduce

07:43.458 --> 07:49.000
microorganisms,

07:49.000 --> 07:51.083
and when the process is complete

07:51.083 --> 07:55.000
we'll have a lush,

07:51.083 --> 07:55.000
arable biosphere.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.041
You make it

07:55.000 --> 07:57.041
sound poetic.

07:57.041 --> 08:00.041
I think it's the best

07:57.041 --> 08:00.041
job in the universe.

08:04.250 --> 08:08.375
The efficiency of your

08:04.250 --> 08:08.375
hydraulic landscaping

08:04.250 --> 08:08.375
is quite elegant.

08:08.375 --> 08:11.333
It isn't yet,

08:08.375 --> 08:11.333
but it will be.

08:11.333 --> 08:14.583
Right now, I'm disturbed

08:11.333 --> 08:14.583
by erratic power surges

08:14.583 --> 08:16.667
in several

08:14.583 --> 08:16.667
of the servomechanisms

08:16.667 --> 08:19.000
that control the

08:16.667 --> 08:19.000
hydraulic probes.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.458
Could the

08:19.000 --> 08:20.458
increased conductivity

08:20.458 --> 08:22.375
be caused by

08:20.458 --> 08:22.375
the high saline content?

08:22.375 --> 08:23.917
That was my first thought,

08:22.375 --> 08:23.917
but I...

08:23.917 --> 08:25.333
BENSEN:

08:23.917 --> 08:25.333
Arthur!

08:25.333 --> 08:29.750
The factors do not

08:25.333 --> 08:29.750
support that conclusion.

08:29.750 --> 08:31.083
I'm Director Mandl,

08:31.083 --> 08:33.834
and I'm sorry

08:31.083 --> 08:33.834
about having been so abrupt

08:33.834 --> 08:36.625
during our initial contact,

08:33.834 --> 08:36.625
but being isolated

08:36.625 --> 08:39.166
one tends to forget

08:36.625 --> 08:39.166
the social graces.

08:39.166 --> 08:41.542
Are you seeing

08:39.166 --> 08:41.542
everything that

08:39.166 --> 08:41.542
you want?

08:41.542 --> 08:43.792
What you're doing

08:41.542 --> 08:43.792
here is miraculous.

08:43.792 --> 08:45.208
What we're doing here

08:45.208 --> 08:47.542
is working a difficult

08:45.208 --> 08:47.542
and demanding timetable,

08:47.542 --> 08:51.083
and there will be no miracle

08:47.542 --> 08:51.083
unless Malencon here

08:51.083 --> 08:55.583
gets the hydraulic probes

08:51.083 --> 08:55.583
back online.

08:55.583 --> 09:01.166
We are set to step up

08:55.583 --> 09:01.166
to full conversion immediately.

09:02.542 --> 09:06.083
Shouldn't you be

09:02.542 --> 09:06.083
in the hydraulic

09:02.542 --> 09:06.083
chamber, Arthur?

09:06.083 --> 09:07.667
Now?

09:07.667 --> 09:09.375
Yes.

09:11.458 --> 09:13.750
All right, Kurt.

09:13.750 --> 09:17.667
Geordi, this appears to be

09:13.750 --> 09:17.667
the master subsurface pump.

09:17.667 --> 09:19.709
You're right.

09:17.667 --> 09:19.709
Very impressive.

09:19.709 --> 09:20.917
This is interesting.

09:20.917 --> 09:22.792
The water table

09:20.917 --> 09:22.792
is a thin ribbon

09:22.792 --> 09:25.291
between the sandy surface layer

09:22.792 --> 09:25.291
and the rocks below.

09:25.291 --> 09:28.375
And those two surfaces follow

09:25.291 --> 09:28.375
that contour so precisely

09:28.375 --> 09:30.709
that the water

09:28.375 --> 09:30.709
maintains a consistent

09:28.375 --> 09:30.709
depth between them.

09:30.709 --> 09:31.959
Which would require

09:31.959 --> 09:33.542
extreme precision

09:31.959 --> 09:33.542
from the probe controls.

09:33.542 --> 09:34.500
Mm-hmm.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.917
Here we have something

09:35.917 --> 09:37.709
that may be of interest

09:35.917 --> 09:37.709
to you--

09:37.709 --> 09:40.542
a vegetation graph.

09:40.542 --> 09:45.917
It is really the key center

09:40.542 --> 09:45.917
for successful terraforming.

09:45.917 --> 09:50.542
RIKER:

09:45.917 --> 09:50.542
Incredible. It's planned month

09:45.917 --> 09:50.542
by month, decade by decade?

09:50.542 --> 09:55.417
Every single thing

09:50.542 --> 09:55.417
is specific and exact.

09:55.417 --> 09:59.709
You see grand,

09:55.417 --> 09:59.709
romantic concepts.

09:59.709 --> 10:01.750
I see unyielding rock

10:01.750 --> 10:04.000
under an

10:01.750 --> 10:04.000
ocean of sand.

10:05.500 --> 10:06.500
Commander!

10:06.500 --> 10:07.792
RIKER:

10:06.500 --> 10:07.792
What is it, Deanna?

10:07.792 --> 10:09.667
Malencon... he's in trouble!

10:09.667 --> 10:11.250
MALENCON:

10:09.667 --> 10:11.250
Help! Help!

10:11.250 --> 10:13.291
(<i> laser bursts</i> )

10:13.291 --> 10:16.500
Help!

10:16.500 --> 10:18.291
Can you open it?

10:18.291 --> 10:19.959
MANDL:

10:18.291 --> 10:19.959
It's jammed.

10:19.959 --> 10:21.667
(<i> Malencon screaming</i> )

10:21.667 --> 10:23.875
(<i> screaming stops</i> )

10:46.750 --> 10:51.000
<i>First Officer's Log,</i>

10:46.750 --> 10:51.000
<i>Stardate 41464.3:</i>

10:51.000 --> 10:53.667
<i>What began as a routine visit</i>

10:51.000 --> 10:53.667
<i>to a terraforming site</i>

10:53.667 --> 10:55.917
<i>has turned into something</i>

10:53.667 --> 10:55.917
<i>far more serious.</i>

10:55.917 --> 10:57.959
<i>Arthur Malencon,</i>

10:55.917 --> 10:57.959
<i>the hydraulics engineer,</i>

10:57.959 --> 11:00.041
<i>has been critically injured</i>

10:57.959 --> 11:00.041
<i>by a laser drill</i>

11:00.041 --> 11:02.041
<i>which appears</i>

11:00.041 --> 11:02.041
<i>to have malfunctioned.</i>

11:05.250 --> 11:07.458
PICARD:

11:05.250 --> 11:07.458
Situation report, Number One.

11:08.792 --> 11:10.208
For safety reasons

11:10.208 --> 11:12.041
we're shutting off all power

11:10.208 --> 11:12.041
to the hydraulics room

11:12.041 --> 11:14.083
before entering

11:12.041 --> 11:14.083
to recover the body.

11:14.083 --> 11:15.959
Then we'll beam him up

11:14.083 --> 11:15.959
to sick bay.

11:15.959 --> 11:18.625
But from the look

11:15.959 --> 11:18.625
of his wounds, it's

11:15.959 --> 11:18.625
probably hopeless.

11:18.625 --> 11:20.458
Keep me informed.

11:20.458 --> 11:21.750
LA FORGE:

11:20.458 --> 11:21.750
Data?

11:21.750 --> 11:23.417
Go ahead, Geordi.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.041
All set.

11:25.041 --> 11:27.208
Data, we have your section

11:25.041 --> 11:27.208
completely powered down.

11:27.208 --> 11:30.166
Bensen has just locked the

11:27.208 --> 11:30.166
master servomotor drive system,

11:30.166 --> 11:32.291
so it should be safe

11:30.166 --> 11:32.291
in there now.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.500
I'm going in.

11:33.500 --> 11:34.917
I will go with you.

11:39.208 --> 11:41.583
Transporter Room,

11:39.208 --> 11:41.583
this is Lieutenant Yar.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.375
Two to beam up to sick bay.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.542
KIM:

11:49.917 --> 11:51.542
I want to go.

11:52.709 --> 11:54.542
We should be with him.

11:56.709 --> 11:58.375
Kurt, please come, too.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.250
Transporter Room,

12:07.208 --> 12:09.250
this is Commander Riker.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.500
Beam up four

12:09.250 --> 12:11.500
at my coordinates.

12:16.291 --> 12:19.083
DATA:

12:16.291 --> 12:19.083
Geordi, this is intriguing.

12:19.083 --> 12:22.291
I have seen malfunctions,

12:22.291 --> 12:27.458
but this is almost

12:22.291 --> 12:27.458
as if the laser drill

12:27.458 --> 12:32.250
seemed to operate with a will

12:32.250 --> 12:36.291
separate from

12:32.250 --> 12:36.291
its control console.

12:36.291 --> 12:38.375
I can't explain it.

12:38.375 --> 12:42.792
The laser blasts seemed to end

12:38.375 --> 12:42.792
when the yelling stopped.

12:44.625 --> 12:47.875
Maybe Arthur stopped it,

12:44.625 --> 12:47.875
only not in time.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.208
Not possible.

12:50.208 --> 12:51.875
Then what are you suggesting?

12:51.875 --> 12:53.625
Uncertain.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.458
Geordi,

12:55.458 --> 12:57.917
please return power to the

12:55.458 --> 12:57.917
control console in this room.

12:57.917 --> 12:59.959
I wish to reactivate

12:57.917 --> 12:59.959
the program.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.917
You got it.

13:14.709 --> 13:18.166
I am now running

13:14.709 --> 13:18.166
the base drilling program.

13:24.625 --> 13:26.417
DATA:

13:24.625 --> 13:26.417
Geordi, servos off!

13:26.417 --> 13:27.792
They<i> are</i> off!

13:27.792 --> 13:28.750
Data, what's happening?

13:28.750 --> 13:30.458
Too much to explain.

13:35.500 --> 13:37.250
Can you open

13:35.500 --> 13:37.250
that? Do it!

13:37.250 --> 13:39.750
La Forge to<i> Enterprise.</i>

13:37.250 --> 13:39.750
We have a problem.

13:39.750 --> 13:40.917
Be specific.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.500
Data's in the

13:40.917 --> 13:42.500
hydraulics room alone,

13:42.500 --> 13:44.083
and we're hearing

13:42.500 --> 13:44.083
laser blasts.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.166
Get him out of there!

13:45.166 --> 13:46.750
It's not working again!

13:46.750 --> 13:48.208
We got to get

13:46.750 --> 13:48.208
this door open.

13:48.208 --> 13:49.917
Data, we can't get in!

13:51.333 --> 13:53.000
Data!

13:53.000 --> 13:55.875
Data! Data!

14:01.417 --> 14:04.333
Away team, now!

14:01.417 --> 14:04.333
What is happening?

14:04.333 --> 14:07.000
I'm going to beam him

14:04.333 --> 14:07.000
out of there!

14:07.000 --> 14:09.875
Bridge, this is

14:07.000 --> 14:09.875
Lieutenant Commander Data.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.625
No need to beam me up, sir.

14:11.625 --> 14:13.667
The situation is under control.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.083
Are you all right?

14:20.083 --> 14:22.041
Yes.

14:20.083 --> 14:22.041
Well, what happened?

14:22.041 --> 14:23.959
Did you do anything

14:22.041 --> 14:23.959
which might have set it off?

14:23.959 --> 14:27.250
No, but the firing program

14:23.959 --> 14:27.250
was dynamic.

14:27.250 --> 14:28.875
The firing pro...

14:28.875 --> 14:30.166
In what way?

14:30.166 --> 14:31.917
It adjusted to my tactics.

14:31.917 --> 14:34.041
It tracked with me,

14:31.917 --> 14:34.041
anticipating.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.291
A fixed program

14:34.041 --> 14:36.291
could not have done that.

14:36.291 --> 14:37.709
Are you suggesting

14:36.291 --> 14:37.709
that someone

14:37.709 --> 14:40.041
was controlling the aiming

14:37.709 --> 14:40.041
and firing sequence?

14:40.041 --> 14:42.166
That is exactly

14:40.041 --> 14:42.166
how it appeared.

14:42.166 --> 14:44.583
There was a mind

14:42.166 --> 14:44.583
working against me.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.875
BENSEN:

14:44.583 --> 14:46.875
What did you do

14:44.583 --> 14:46.875
to this laser drill?

14:48.542 --> 14:53.542
A year's work... destroyed!

14:53.542 --> 14:55.667
I had no choice.

15:01.834 --> 15:04.625
We were attempting to trace

15:01.834 --> 15:04.625
the source of the malfunction

15:04.625 --> 15:05.959
when it attacked me.

15:05.959 --> 15:08.083
How much more of this

15:05.959 --> 15:08.083
useless fantasy

15:08.083 --> 15:09.750
do I have to listen to?

15:09.750 --> 15:10.875
None at all, Mr. Mandl.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.458
Until this is resolved,

15:12.458 --> 15:14.208
I've provided temporary quarters

15:12.458 --> 15:14.208
for you and your staff.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.041
Perhaps you'd like

15:14.208 --> 15:16.041
to make use of them.

15:16.041 --> 15:18.500
You're overstepping

15:16.041 --> 15:18.500
your authority, Picard.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.750
You have no right

15:18.500 --> 15:20.750
to interfere.

15:20.750 --> 15:23.959
Mr. Mandl, an attack on one

15:20.750 --> 15:23.959
of my crew gives me the right.

15:23.959 --> 15:25.625
I have a schedule to meet.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.083
Your schedule is on hold

15:27.083 --> 15:29.583
until I have a satisfactory

15:27.083 --> 15:29.583
explanation of this.

15:31.458 --> 15:33.792
Director Mandl...

15:33.792 --> 15:37.417
Lieutenant Yar, would you escort

15:33.792 --> 15:37.417
the director to his quarters?

15:37.417 --> 15:38.625
Aye, sir.

15:41.417 --> 15:43.166
Go on with your report.

15:43.166 --> 15:45.250
It would appear the

15:43.166 --> 15:45.250
laser's drilling system

15:45.250 --> 15:46.750
was reprogrammed, sir.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.792
As soon as its memory

15:46.750 --> 15:48.792
bank received power,

15:48.792 --> 15:51.208
it turned itself on

15:48.792 --> 15:51.208
and went after me.

15:51.208 --> 15:53.208
Fortunately, I was

15:51.208 --> 15:53.208
able to cope with it.

15:53.208 --> 15:55.875
And not by much,

15:53.208 --> 15:55.875
from what I saw.

15:55.875 --> 15:57.375
I believe it

15:55.875 --> 15:57.375
was programmed

15:57.375 --> 15:59.709
to destroy any person

15:57.375 --> 15:59.709
moving in that room, sir.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.375
Certainty or speculation?

16:02.375 --> 16:03.500
Certainty.

16:03.500 --> 16:04.917
That would have

16:03.500 --> 16:04.917
required the talents

16:04.917 --> 16:06.166
of a master programmer.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.500
But it was done.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.166
And so,

16:07.500 --> 16:10.166
the question becomes not who.

16:10.166 --> 16:13.291
Since it clearly was one of the

16:10.166 --> 16:13.291
three remaining terraformers,

16:13.291 --> 16:15.125
the question becomes why?

16:15.125 --> 16:16.875
What are they hiding?

16:16.875 --> 16:19.542
What could be so important

16:16.875 --> 16:19.542
that one or all of them

16:19.542 --> 16:24.000
could be desperate

16:19.542 --> 16:24.000
enough to kill?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.083
Shall I have them

16:24.000 --> 16:26.083
brought in, sir?

16:28.041 --> 16:29.667
Not yet.

16:31.041 --> 16:32.458
Malencon?

16:32.458 --> 16:33.458
I couldn't save him.

16:33.458 --> 16:34.500
The injuries

16:33.458 --> 16:34.500
were too severe,

16:34.500 --> 16:36.250
the damage

16:34.500 --> 16:36.250
too extensive.

16:36.250 --> 16:39.000
The entire Velara III facility

16:36.250 --> 16:39.000
has been powered down, Captain.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.792
We just completed

16:39.000 --> 16:40.792
a remote power feed

16:40.792 --> 16:42.667
to the life-support systems.

16:42.667 --> 16:46.375
Good. Data, I want you

16:42.667 --> 16:46.375
and Geordi to return for

16:42.667 --> 16:46.375
more careful inspection.

16:46.375 --> 16:47.834
What are we to

16:46.375 --> 16:47.834
look for, sir?

16:47.834 --> 16:49.041
Evidence of tampering,

16:49.041 --> 16:51.000
negligence, sabotage,

16:49.041 --> 16:51.000
whatever...

16:51.000 --> 16:52.542
The answer is there,

16:51.000 --> 16:52.542
on the planet.

16:52.542 --> 16:54.792
Tasha, I want you to provide

16:52.542 --> 16:54.792
Counselor Troi and me

16:54.792 --> 16:57.125
with complete personnel records

16:54.792 --> 16:57.125
of our three guests.

16:57.125 --> 16:58.875
Psych profiles,

16:57.125 --> 16:58.875
training-- everything.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.542
I'm looking for

16:58.875 --> 17:00.542
motive, intent...

17:00.542 --> 17:02.500
the psychological capacity

17:00.542 --> 17:02.500
to commit one murder

17:02.500 --> 17:03.458
and to attempt another.

17:03.458 --> 17:04.834
Aye, sir.

17:04.834 --> 17:07.250
It seems we are becoming

17:04.834 --> 17:07.250
detectives, Number One.

17:26.375 --> 17:28.792
Not much left

17:26.375 --> 17:28.792
of this drill.

17:43.208 --> 17:46.166
Geordi, I need

17:43.208 --> 17:46.166
some visual assistance.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.458
Whoa...

17:51.458 --> 17:53.208
What is it?

17:57.125 --> 18:00.834
Nothing but basic elements.

18:00.834 --> 18:03.041
Inorganic...

18:03.041 --> 18:04.625
no carbon...

18:04.625 --> 18:06.375
sandy texture...

18:06.375 --> 18:10.625
but those flashes

18:06.375 --> 18:10.625
are almost...

18:10.625 --> 18:13.709
musical.

18:13.709 --> 18:15.625
I see color variations

18:15.625 --> 18:17.667
and... rhythms

18:17.667 --> 18:21.375
and complex harmonies.

18:25.875 --> 18:28.125
Speculation--

18:28.125 --> 18:30.458
could it be alive?

18:30.458 --> 18:33.875
How could it be alive?

18:30.458 --> 18:33.875
It's inorganic.

18:33.875 --> 18:35.917
Whatever it is,

18:35.917 --> 18:39.250
it could be what

18:35.917 --> 18:39.250
they are covering up--

18:39.250 --> 18:42.375
and the reason

18:39.250 --> 18:42.375
someone killed Malencon.

18:47.834 --> 18:49.375
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

18:49.375 --> 18:51.750
<i>On my order,</i>

18:49.375 --> 18:51.750
<i>Data's startling discovery</i>

18:51.750 --> 18:54.083

18:54.083 --> 18:56.834

18:54.083 --> 18:56.834

18:56.834 --> 18:58.834
<i>but unlike life on Earth</i>

18:56.834 --> 18:58.834
<i>and elsewhere</i>

18:58.834 --> 19:01.667
<i>it appears to be</i>

18:58.834 --> 19:01.667
<i>completely inorganic.</i>

19:01.667 --> 19:03.542
A test for inorganic life.

19:03.542 --> 19:04.959
It has never

19:03.542 --> 19:04.959
been done, Doctor.

19:04.959 --> 19:07.250
There are basic

19:04.959 --> 19:07.250
definitions for

19:04.959 --> 19:07.250
organic life.

19:07.250 --> 19:09.834
It must have the ability

19:07.250 --> 19:09.834
to assimilate, respirate,

19:09.834 --> 19:13.250
reproduce, grow and develop,

19:09.834 --> 19:13.250
move, secrete and excrete.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.792
Would any of those

19:13.250 --> 19:14.792
apply here?

19:14.792 --> 19:16.917
Perhaps growth

19:14.792 --> 19:16.917
and development.

19:16.917 --> 19:18.709
Reproduction?

19:18.709 --> 19:20.250
Yes.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.542
Those two may be basic

19:20.250 --> 19:22.542
for any definition of life--

19:22.542 --> 19:24.458
organic or inorganic.

19:24.458 --> 19:26.458
Well, Doctor,

19:24.458 --> 19:26.458
you're charting unknown seas.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.875
So, how do we proceed?

19:27.875 --> 19:29.667
Since we're dealing with

19:27.875 --> 19:29.667
a fundamental question,

19:29.667 --> 19:31.834
let's use the basic

19:29.667 --> 19:31.834
scientific method:

19:31.834 --> 19:35.041
observe, theorize and

19:31.834 --> 19:35.041
attempt to prove it.

19:35.041 --> 19:36.667
Activate.

19:36.667 --> 19:38.333
Let's be sure of what

19:36.667 --> 19:38.333
we're dealing with.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.250
Is the sample organic?

19:40.250 --> 19:41.959
COMPUTER:

19:40.250 --> 19:41.959
Negative carbon.

19:41.959 --> 19:44.083
Negative known life components.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.667
Substance inorganic.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.667
Mm-hmm.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.250
Recheck analysis, please.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.792
Rechecking.

19:49.792 --> 19:51.375
Analysis verified.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.542
Not organic.

19:53.542 --> 19:55.875
Magnify to screen.

19:59.417 --> 20:00.959
Factor five.

20:02.250 --> 20:04.959
Hold surface.

20:04.959 --> 20:07.000
Factor ten.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.083
(<i> soft humming</i> )

20:11.500 --> 20:13.166
What are we

20:11.500 --> 20:13.166
looking at?

20:13.166 --> 20:15.834
It's beautiful,

20:13.166 --> 20:15.834
whatever it is.

20:19.834 --> 20:21.875
What's that hum?

20:21.875 --> 20:25.458
It started after Dr. Crusher

20:21.875 --> 20:25.458
ordered the scanner to magnify.

20:25.458 --> 20:29.125
Computer, demagnify.

20:25.458 --> 20:29.125
Resume normal scan.

20:32.125 --> 20:34.500
(<i> humming gets louder</i> )

20:34.500 --> 20:36.667
Everyone stand back.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.000
(<i> humming softens</i> )

20:39.000 --> 20:40.583
Step back again.

20:40.583 --> 20:42.834
(<i> very faint humming</i> )

20:44.875 --> 20:46.625
It's us.

20:46.625 --> 20:49.709
Yes. We're causing it.

20:46.625 --> 20:49.709
Why?

20:49.709 --> 20:54.250
Unknown, but it is definitely

20:49.709 --> 20:54.250
reacting to our presence.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.458
Perhaps it is picking up

20:55.458 --> 20:57.709
the electrical impulse

20:55.458 --> 20:57.709
of our systems.

20:57.709 --> 21:00.000
The flashes haven't changed.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.500
Could the hum be connected

21:00.000 --> 21:02.500
to the flashing?

21:03.959 --> 21:05.917
Computer, magnify.

21:07.583 --> 21:09.667
What is the magnification?

21:09.667 --> 21:13.166
2500 diameters.

21:13.166 --> 21:17.125
Analyze the pattern

21:13.166 --> 21:17.125
of the flashes.

21:17.125 --> 21:19.959
Not repetitive or sequential.

21:19.959 --> 21:22.792
Pattern not recognized.

21:22.792 --> 21:24.542
What is the source

21:22.792 --> 21:24.542
of the flashes?

21:24.542 --> 21:26.625
Unable to specify.

21:26.625 --> 21:30.500
Theoretically not possible

21:26.625 --> 21:30.500
from this substance.

21:30.500 --> 21:33.709
Disregard incongruity

21:33.709 --> 21:36.291
and theorize as to source.

21:38.709 --> 21:41.000
Life.

21:53.417 --> 21:55.458
What do you mean,

21:53.417 --> 21:55.458
a life-form?

21:55.458 --> 21:57.500
What life-form?

21:57.500 --> 22:02.250
A Federation recon

21:57.500 --> 22:02.250
expedition certified

21:57.500 --> 22:02.250
Velara III lifeless.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.750
Understandable

22:03.750 --> 22:06.417
given this particular

22:03.750 --> 22:06.417
life-form's novel nature.

22:06.417 --> 22:08.583
What is that nature?

22:08.583 --> 22:10.750
Dr. Crusher is still making

22:08.583 --> 22:10.750
her determination.

22:10.750 --> 22:15.458
Mr. Mandl, you know

22:10.750 --> 22:15.458
the Prime Directive.

22:15.458 --> 22:18.709
Are you saying that I

22:15.458 --> 22:18.709
knowingly defied it?

22:18.709 --> 22:20.125
That's what I have to

22:18.709 --> 22:20.125
find out.

22:20.125 --> 22:21.792
You're a man obsessed

22:20.125 --> 22:21.792
with what you do.

22:21.792 --> 22:25.333
Who knows what an obsessed man

22:21.792 --> 22:25.333
will do to keep going.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.500
Kill, perhaps?

22:27.500 --> 22:29.959
I create life.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.083
I don't take it.

22:41.959 --> 22:45.542
You hit him pretty

22:41.959 --> 22:45.542
hard, Captain.

22:45.542 --> 22:47.083
What do you think, Counselor?

22:47.083 --> 22:49.250
It was useful.

22:49.250 --> 22:50.917
I felt two levels.

22:50.917 --> 22:52.792
He did know about the life-form,

22:52.792 --> 22:55.375
but the idea of murder

22:52.792 --> 22:55.375
seemed to shock him.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.792
Whether it was the whole idea

22:56.792 --> 22:59.291
or just being accused of it,

22:56.792 --> 22:59.291
I can't tell.

22:59.291 --> 23:01.750
What about his file,

22:59.291 --> 23:01.750
Lieutenant Yar?

23:01.750 --> 23:03.834
Could he have accomplished

23:01.750 --> 23:03.834
the reprogramming

23:03.834 --> 23:05.709
that Data says took place?

23:05.709 --> 23:07.500
Mandl holds advanced degrees

23:05.709 --> 23:07.500
in computer science

23:07.500 --> 23:09.750
as well as

23:07.500 --> 23:09.750
artificial intelligence.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.125
It's possible.

23:11.125 --> 23:13.041
What about the others,

23:11.125 --> 23:13.041
including the victim?

23:13.041 --> 23:16.291
Well, only the victim had

23:13.041 --> 23:16.291
the required expertise.

23:16.291 --> 23:18.458
Malencon did work

23:16.291 --> 23:18.458
where the...

23:18.458 --> 23:20.208
whatever it is was found.

23:20.208 --> 23:21.917
Trying to suppress

23:20.208 --> 23:21.917
that knowledge

23:21.917 --> 23:23.458
would be motive

23:21.917 --> 23:23.458
for murder

23:23.458 --> 23:25.959
<i>if</i> Mandl were

23:23.458 --> 23:25.959
obsessed enough.

23:25.959 --> 23:28.083
Terraformers are

23:25.959 --> 23:28.083
often obsessive.

23:28.083 --> 23:30.959
It frequently goes

23:28.083 --> 23:30.959
with the career profile.

23:30.959 --> 23:33.250
How do you read

23:30.959 --> 23:33.250

She is possessed of highly

23:33.250 --> 23:36.291

Lovely visions,

23:36.291 --> 23:39.083

23:39.083 --> 23:42.500
But you might do

23:39.083 --> 23:42.500
better than I.

Mind a visitor?

24:08.625 --> 24:10.500
Is it true?

24:13.500 --> 24:16.291
Did you really find

24:13.500 --> 24:16.291
a life-form?

24:16.291 --> 24:19.125
Well, the debate

24:16.291 --> 24:19.125
is still going on

24:16.291 --> 24:19.125
in some quarters,

24:19.125 --> 24:22.333
but I think so, yes.

24:23.792 --> 24:26.333
What's it like?

24:26.333 --> 24:29.375
We have nothing we

24:26.333 --> 24:29.375
can compare it with.

24:29.375 --> 24:30.500
It's microscopic.

24:30.500 --> 24:35.291
It seems

24:30.500 --> 24:35.291
colonial, simple,

24:35.291 --> 24:37.208
but it's inorganic,

24:37.208 --> 24:39.166
which is why the recon

24:37.208 --> 24:39.166
scouts missed it.

24:39.166 --> 24:41.625
It was not your mistake.

24:46.625 --> 24:50.083
Everything I've worked

24:46.625 --> 24:50.083

25:11.375 --> 25:14.083

25:16.500 --> 25:19.041
Perhaps later.

25:34.709 --> 25:36.542
Captain, this is Dr. Crusher.

27:29.083 --> 27:31.250
translator circuit?

27:31.250 --> 27:33.875
Bridge, this is the Captain.

27:33.875 --> 27:37.792
Request emergency

27:33.875 --> 27:37.792
power to initiate

27:33.875 --> 27:37.792
lab quarantine seal.

27:37.792 --> 27:39.250
Do it, Mr. Worf.

27:39.250 --> 27:40.917
Aye, sir.

27:40.917 --> 27:43.291
What's the nature of

27:40.917 --> 27:43.291
the problem, Captain?

27:40.917 --> 27:43.291
We've lost visual.

27:43.291 --> 27:46.583
We have confirmed

27:43.291 --> 27:46.583
that Data's discovery is life,

27:46.583 --> 27:49.208
but more than that...

27:49.208 --> 27:51.125
it is intelligent life.

27:53.709 --> 27:55.375
How do you know, sir?

28:00.125 --> 28:02.542
It's trying

28:00.125 --> 28:02.542
to communicate with us.

28:07.125 --> 28:08.750
<i>Captain's Log, supplemental:</i>

28:08.750 --> 28:10.750
<i>The inorganic life-form</i>

28:08.750 --> 28:10.750
<i>from Velara III</i>

28:10.750 --> 28:14.250
<i>has apparently taken over</i>

28:10.750 --> 28:14.250
<i>our medical lab.</i>

28:14.250 --> 28:15.625
It generates enough energy

28:15.625 --> 28:17.333
to interfere with the

28:15.625 --> 28:17.333
surrounding systems.

28:17.333 --> 28:19.125
Mr. La Forge,

28:17.333 --> 28:19.125
can we see into the lab yet?

28:19.125 --> 28:21.000
Negative, Captain.

28:19.125 --> 28:21.000
Reducing the backup

28:21.000 --> 28:22.500
to the quarantine seal

28:21.000 --> 28:22.500
might help.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.458
Doctor?

28:22.500 --> 28:24.458
I wouldn't.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.417
Continue quarantine.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.417
Aye, sir.

28:26.417 --> 28:28.875
YAR:

28:26.417 --> 28:28.875
Director Mandl and the others

28:26.417 --> 28:28.875
are in the observation lounge

28:28.875 --> 28:30.125
as you requested.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.417
Counselor,

28:30.125 --> 28:31.417
I shall need you.

28:31.417 --> 28:33.333
You have the Bridge,

28:31.417 --> 28:33.333
Number One.

28:37.834 --> 28:40.333
Director Mandl,

28:37.834 --> 28:40.333
I put it to you again.

28:40.333 --> 28:42.542
What do you know

28:40.333 --> 28:42.542
about these life-forms?

28:42.542 --> 28:43.875
Not a thing.

28:43.875 --> 28:45.166
Enough.

28:48.250 --> 28:49.834
Sit down, Lieutenant.

28:49.834 --> 28:52.166
You are deliberately evasive,

28:49.834 --> 28:52.166
and it must stop.

28:52.166 --> 28:53.542
You have kept information

28:52.166 --> 28:53.542
from me

28:53.542 --> 28:55.250
since our first communication.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.625
An alien life-form

28:55.250 --> 28:57.625
has taken possession

28:57.625 --> 28:59.834
of my medical lab.

29:01.542 --> 29:04.583
You knew of

29:01.542 --> 29:04.583
its existence.

29:04.583 --> 29:05.750
Yes.

29:05.750 --> 29:07.583
Is this true?

29:07.583 --> 29:10.166
You knew there was

29:07.583 --> 29:10.166
life on Velara III?

29:10.166 --> 29:13.208
I knew that there were

29:10.166 --> 29:13.208
random energy patterns.

29:13.208 --> 29:17.250
Yes, I knew that,

29:13.208 --> 29:17.250
but not life.

29:17.250 --> 29:19.959
Not by any definition

29:17.250 --> 29:19.959
that I've ever heard.

29:19.959 --> 29:23.000
But you tried to keep

29:19.959 --> 29:23.000
that knowledge from us.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.458
No, they are meaningless

29:23.000 --> 29:26.458
silicon crystals

29:26.458 --> 29:28.750
which rebroadcast sunlight.

29:28.750 --> 29:31.375
It is a life-form,

29:28.750 --> 29:31.375
and it has intelligence.

29:34.375 --> 29:36.166
Why do you say that?

29:36.166 --> 29:38.542
It's trying to communicate

29:36.166 --> 29:38.542
with us.

29:38.542 --> 29:41.500
Communicate with you?

29:41.500 --> 29:43.709
When did you first become aware

29:41.500 --> 29:43.709
of them?

29:45.875 --> 29:48.333
Tell them about the pattern

29:45.875 --> 29:48.333
in the sand.

29:48.333 --> 29:51.125
Oh, yes, do tell us.

29:54.667 --> 29:55.917
When we first arrived,

29:55.917 --> 29:57.875
we noticed that

29:55.917 --> 29:57.875
in certain areas

29:57.875 --> 30:00.709
the sand had

29:57.875 --> 30:00.709
a sparkling effect

30:00.709 --> 30:04.667
like sunlight bouncing off

30:00.709 --> 30:04.667
new-fallen snow.

30:04.667 --> 30:06.625
What did you think it was?

30:06.625 --> 30:10.083
Honestly, we did not

30:06.625 --> 30:10.083
give it any thought.

30:10.083 --> 30:14.041
Picard, I must point out again

30:14.041 --> 30:18.083
that we were assured--

30:14.041 --> 30:18.083
not once, but many times--

30:18.083 --> 30:21.542
by the best scientific minds

30:18.083 --> 30:21.542
in the Federation

30:21.542 --> 30:26.291
that this planet has no life--

30:21.542 --> 30:26.291
no life!

30:26.291 --> 30:28.333
And we were not looking,

30:28.333 --> 30:30.291
and therefore we did not see.

30:30.291 --> 30:32.375
All right,

30:30.291 --> 30:32.375
at first you dismissed it,

30:32.375 --> 30:35.166
but then,

30:32.375 --> 30:35.166
you began to understand

30:35.166 --> 30:36.792
that there was something

30:36.792 --> 30:38.667
that was different

30:36.792 --> 30:38.667
about them.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.709
You can't know that.

30:40.709 --> 30:44.792
Your apprehension suggested it

30:40.709 --> 30:44.792
when we first arrived.

30:44.792 --> 30:47.709
Tell me about these patterns.

30:47.709 --> 30:50.125
At first we thought

30:47.709 --> 30:50.125
it was just natural phenomenon

30:50.125 --> 30:51.458
unique to Velara III.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.750
Refraction

30:52.750 --> 30:55.792
in a thin atmosphere

30:52.750 --> 30:55.792
is interesting

30:55.792 --> 30:58.041
but certainly

30:55.792 --> 30:58.041
not life.

30:58.041 --> 31:00.083
Why was I never

30:58.041 --> 31:00.083
told about this?

31:00.083 --> 31:02.917
Because it's not

31:00.083 --> 31:02.917
particularly important.

31:02.917 --> 31:04.542
As the building

31:04.542 --> 31:06.792
of the terraforming

31:04.542 --> 31:06.792
station went forward,

31:06.792 --> 31:09.417
the patterns in the sand

31:06.792 --> 31:09.417
ceased being random.

31:09.417 --> 31:11.291
They became very specific.

31:11.291 --> 31:15.458
Geometric shapes suddenly

31:11.291 --> 31:15.458
appearing, disappearing,

31:15.458 --> 31:17.166
uh, changing location,

31:17.166 --> 31:18.500
changing size.

31:18.500 --> 31:20.500
Did you ever feel

31:20.500 --> 31:24.542
that these patterns

31:20.500 --> 31:24.542
were attempting to communicate?

31:27.125 --> 31:29.417
No, never.

31:30.834 --> 31:32.333
Bensen?

31:32.333 --> 31:34.208
I don't know.

31:34.208 --> 31:37.125
At the time,

31:34.208 --> 31:37.125
I didn't think so,

31:37.125 --> 31:40.792
but now after hearing

31:37.125 --> 31:40.792
what you just said...

31:40.792 --> 31:43.667
now... I don't know.

31:43.667 --> 31:46.834
RIKER:

31:43.667 --> 31:46.834
Captain, we've regained

31:43.667 --> 31:46.834
magnification on the life-form.

31:46.834 --> 31:48.208
It's divided again.

31:48.208 --> 31:50.375
Patch visual

31:48.208 --> 31:50.375
to observation lounge.

31:56.542 --> 32:01.208
There was no indication

31:56.542 --> 32:01.208
of any of this on Velara III.

32:01.208 --> 32:03.125
Absolutely none.

32:06.917 --> 32:08.625
I cannot understand

32:06.917 --> 32:08.625
the patterns.

32:08.625 --> 32:10.625
Mm, neither can I.

32:10.625 --> 32:12.500
Please show me

32:10.625 --> 32:12.500
spectral analysis--

32:12.500 --> 32:14.250
magnification 12k.

32:14.250 --> 32:16.166
COMPUTER:

32:14.250 --> 32:16.166
Silicon, germanium.

32:16.166 --> 32:17.417
Transistor material.

32:17.417 --> 32:18.792
Gallium arsenide.

32:18.792 --> 32:20.417
Emits light when charged.

32:20.417 --> 32:22.375
Cadmium selenide, sulfide.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.709
Emits charge when lit.

32:23.709 --> 32:26.375
Water, impurities,

32:23.709 --> 32:26.375
sodium salts.

32:26.375 --> 32:27.917
Conductor.

32:30.709 --> 32:32.000
But is it alive?

32:32.000 --> 32:33.792
Probability positive.

32:33.792 --> 32:35.792
I wasn't

32:33.792 --> 32:35.792
asking you.

32:35.792 --> 32:37.709
Engineering to Bridge.

32:37.709 --> 32:39.625
This is Commander Riker.

32:37.709 --> 32:39.625
Go ahead.

32:39.625 --> 32:43.125
The backup on the lab seal

32:39.625 --> 32:43.125
is fluctuating, sir.

32:43.125 --> 32:45.667
I think you should

32:43.125 --> 32:45.667
come down here.

32:45.667 --> 32:48.583
On my way.

32:48.583 --> 32:50.875
Data, you've got the Bridge.

32:50.875 --> 32:52.458
Inform the Captain.

32:57.750 --> 32:59.041
Status, Ensign.

32:59.041 --> 33:01.875
The quarantine seal

32:59.041 --> 33:01.875
is getting weaker, sir.

33:01.875 --> 33:03.542
Every time I try

33:01.875 --> 33:03.542
to redirect backup,

33:03.542 --> 33:04.959
it goes somewhere else.

33:04.959 --> 33:06.333
I think I've...

33:06.333 --> 33:09.583
No, no, it's locked three

33:06.333 --> 33:09.583
people in a turbolift

33:09.583 --> 33:12.500
and two more in the

33:09.583 --> 33:12.500
programmers' restroom.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.375
If that reading is right,

33:12.500 --> 33:14.375
there is no seal.

33:14.375 --> 33:15.834
Give me lab

33:14.375 --> 33:15.834
interior image.

33:15.834 --> 33:17.333
Yes, sir.

33:20.709 --> 33:22.542
Magnify.

33:25.792 --> 33:28.083
Picard, this is Riker.

33:28.083 --> 33:30.792
We see it, too,

33:28.083 --> 33:30.792
Number One.

33:36.834 --> 33:38.709
Get that seal back up!

33:38.709 --> 33:40.667
But, sir, no matter

33:38.709 --> 33:40.667
what I do,

33:40.667 --> 33:42.291
the energy goes

33:40.667 --> 33:42.291
somewhere else.

33:42.291 --> 33:44.166
What if it hits

33:42.291 --> 33:44.166
the sick bay or nursery?

33:44.166 --> 33:46.208
Hold off.

33:44.166 --> 33:46.208
Impossible, Captain.

33:46.208 --> 33:47.583
We haven't got the power.

a flexible container.

34:18.250 --> 34:23.417
Life force,

34:18.250 --> 34:23.417
do you understand us?

34:25.500 --> 34:27.709
We understand.

34:27.709 --> 34:30.333
We ask that you be gone.

34:30.333 --> 34:34.208
We call. We talk.

34:30.333 --> 34:34.208
You do not listen.

34:34.208 --> 34:36.041
We didn't hear you.

We come in peace.

Bag who drilled in sand of home

34:46.375 --> 34:51.291
had to die.

34:51.291 --> 34:53.208
It killed Malencon.

34:54.959 --> 34:58.041
We see and hear you now.

34:58.041 --> 35:01.041
We didn't know you were there.

All life is beautiful.

35:07.667 --> 35:10.834

35:10.834 --> 35:13.583
Caused much death.

35:13.583 --> 35:16.166

Sir, that chaos when we were

35:33.542 --> 35:37.709
studying it in the lab

35:37.709 --> 35:41.041
must have been the energy surge

35:37.709 --> 35:41.041
of a reproductive cycle.

35:41.041 --> 35:43.208
It is now a colony

36:03.667 --> 36:05.709
<i>but our attempts</i>

36:03.667 --> 36:05.709
<i>to restore communication</i>

36:05.709 --> 36:08.250
<i>with this microbrain,</i>

36:05.709 --> 36:08.250
<i>as we have come to call it,</i>

36:08.250 --> 36:09.834
<i>have been unsuccessful.</i>

36:09.834 --> 36:11.667
<i>One thing that is certain,</i>

36:09.834 --> 36:11.667
<i>however,</i>

36:11.667 --> 36:15.000
<i>this life-form</i>

36:11.667 --> 36:15.000
<i>has declared war on us.</i>

36:15.000 --> 36:16.834
The range of influence

36:15.000 --> 36:16.834
appears to be concentrated

36:16.834 --> 36:18.166
in the medical lab, Captain.

36:18.166 --> 36:19.709
All nonessential personnel have

36:18.166 --> 36:19.709
been moved

36:19.709 --> 36:21.709
to the most distant areas

36:19.709 --> 36:21.709
of the ship, sir.

36:21.709 --> 36:24.458
Data, any analysis on those

36:21.709 --> 36:24.458
bolts of light it emits?

36:24.458 --> 36:27.208
That seems to be its method

36:24.458 --> 36:27.208
of reprogramming, Captain.

36:27.208 --> 36:28.667
Each bolt of light

36:27.208 --> 36:28.667
consists

36:28.667 --> 36:30.625
of negatively

36:28.667 --> 36:30.625
and positively

36:28.667 --> 36:30.625
charged ions--

36:30.625 --> 36:33.750
a series of program

36:30.625 --> 36:33.750
instructions, as it were.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.166
It seems to have

36:33.750 --> 36:35.166
a quicker rapport

36:35.166 --> 36:36.709
with our computers

36:35.166 --> 36:36.709
than we have.

36:36.709 --> 36:39.834
What do you expect?

36:36.709 --> 36:39.834
It<i> is</i> a computer.

36:39.834 --> 36:42.542
Have we disabled the medical lab

36:39.834 --> 36:42.542
computer console?

36:42.542 --> 36:44.083
Aye, sir. As soon

36:42.542 --> 36:44.083
as Data determined

36:44.083 --> 36:45.667
the microbrain's method

36:44.083 --> 36:45.667
of operation.

36:45.667 --> 36:49.166
Captain, picking up a decrease

36:45.667 --> 36:49.166
in infrared intensity.

36:49.166 --> 36:52.208
Maybe the life-form

36:49.166 --> 36:52.208
has reached its energy level.

36:52.208 --> 36:54.333
Or maybe that's not

36:52.208 --> 36:54.333
the end of it.

36:54.333 --> 36:56.875
With single-celled

36:54.333 --> 36:56.875
life-forms,

36:56.875 --> 36:58.959
at least organic ones,

36:58.959 --> 37:02.291
cell division is preceded

36:58.959 --> 37:02.291
by a resting state.

37:02.291 --> 37:04.750
The calm before the storm.

37:04.750 --> 37:08.291
Medical lab on main viewer.

37:04.750 --> 37:08.291
Let's use this calm.

37:13.667 --> 37:15.917
It does seem dormant, Captain.

37:18.208 --> 37:19.750
Tasha...

37:22.542 --> 37:26.875
set coordinates to beam it back

37:22.542 --> 37:26.875
where it came from.

37:26.875 --> 37:28.750
Coordinates set, sir.

37:28.750 --> 37:30.667
Energize.

37:39.625 --> 37:42.458
Transporter power beam

37:39.625 --> 37:42.458
redirected, sir.

37:42.458 --> 37:46.083
We are unable

37:42.458 --> 37:46.083
to affect it.

37:53.583 --> 37:56.792
Life-form or not,

37:53.583 --> 37:56.792
intelligent or not,

37:56.792 --> 37:58.667
the safety of this ship

37:56.792 --> 37:58.667
and everyone aboard her

37:58.667 --> 38:00.291
is my primary responsibility.

38:00.291 --> 38:01.583
Data...

38:03.208 --> 38:05.250
evacuate all the air

38:03.208 --> 38:05.250
from the medical lab.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.917
I want a vacuum there.

38:06.917 --> 38:09.667
(<i> staticky beeps</i> )

38:09.667 --> 38:13.375
Environmental systems fail

38:09.667 --> 38:13.375
to respond to command, Captain.

38:13.375 --> 38:16.041
It appears the microbrain

38:13.375 --> 38:16.041
has successfully interfaced

38:16.041 --> 38:17.792
with our computers.

38:23.250 --> 38:25.625
Picard, if it did try

38:23.250 --> 38:25.625
to communicate with us,

38:25.625 --> 38:27.375
we didn't

38:25.625 --> 38:27.375
understand that!

38:27.375 --> 38:30.125
It has declared a state of war

38:27.375 --> 38:30.125
and we are on the defensive.

38:30.125 --> 38:32.750
We have no control

38:30.125 --> 38:32.750
over our medical lab,

38:30.125 --> 38:32.750
nor our computer.

38:32.750 --> 38:35.333
At this moment,

38:32.750 --> 38:35.333
it has the power

38:32.750 --> 38:35.333
to destroy this ship

38:35.333 --> 38:37.041
and everybody on it!

38:37.041 --> 38:38.208
I need your help.

38:38.208 --> 38:39.875
Unbelievable.

38:39.875 --> 38:41.333
It said you were trying

38:39.875 --> 38:41.333
to kill some of them.

38:41.333 --> 38:42.667
I need to know how.

38:42.667 --> 38:45.125
I don't know!

38:45.125 --> 38:47.917
What was Malencon doing

38:45.125 --> 38:47.917
when he was killed?

38:47.917 --> 38:49.458
There is a

38:47.917 --> 38:49.458
very thin layer

38:49.458 --> 38:52.333
of highly saline water

38:49.458 --> 38:52.333
under the sandy topsoil.

38:52.333 --> 38:54.625
He was siphoning

38:52.333 --> 38:54.625
that off.

38:54.625 --> 38:57.959
Perhaps somehow that saline

38:54.625 --> 38:57.959
water sustained them.

38:57.959 --> 38:59.375
It connected them.

38:59.375 --> 39:00.625
I don't understand.

39:00.625 --> 39:01.917
The microbrains

39:00.625 --> 39:01.917
may be

39:01.917 --> 39:03.458
like our own brain cells.

39:03.458 --> 39:06.208
Individually, a cell

39:03.458 --> 39:06.208
has life but not intelligence.

39:06.208 --> 39:08.041
Yet when

39:06.208 --> 39:08.041
interconnected,

39:08.041 --> 39:10.667
their combined

39:08.041 --> 39:10.667
intelligence

39:08.041 --> 39:10.667
is formidable.

39:10.667 --> 39:13.375
The saline fluid

39:10.667 --> 39:13.375
is their circuitry.

39:13.375 --> 39:16.834
And to prevent its loss,

39:13.375 --> 39:16.834
they killed Malencon.

39:20.208 --> 39:23.083
If we had continued

39:20.208 --> 39:23.083
to remove that water...

39:25.041 --> 39:27.667
we would have

39:25.041 --> 39:27.667
destroyed them all.

39:27.667 --> 39:31.083
A reason enough

39:27.667 --> 39:31.083
for anyone to go to war.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.875
RIKER:

39:33.000 --> 39:34.875
Captain, it's happening again.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.917
I think

39:34.875 --> 39:36.917
you'd better get in here.

39:48.458 --> 39:49.667
RIKER:

39:48.458 --> 39:49.667
If this keeps up,

39:49.667 --> 39:51.000
it will tear up

39:49.667 --> 39:51.000
the<i> Enterprise.</i>

39:51.000 --> 39:52.500
What can you determine,

39:51.000 --> 39:52.500
Mr. La Forge?

39:52.500 --> 39:55.208
Captain, our

39:52.500 --> 39:55.208
sensors indicate

39:52.500 --> 39:55.208
that the microbrain

39:55.208 --> 39:57.041
expends a tremendous

39:55.208 --> 39:57.041
amount of energy

39:57.041 --> 39:58.625
during its

39:57.041 --> 39:58.625
reproductive cycle

39:58.625 --> 40:00.542
yet there is

39:58.625 --> 40:00.542
no discernible

39:58.625 --> 40:00.542
power drain

40:00.542 --> 40:01.750
on our own systems.

40:01.750 --> 40:03.166
Then, what is feeding

40:01.750 --> 40:03.166
the damn thing?

40:03.166 --> 40:05.083
We found traces

40:03.166 --> 40:05.083
of cadmium salts.

40:05.083 --> 40:07.542
Now, cadmium is a conduit

40:05.083 --> 40:07.542
for converting infrared

40:07.542 --> 40:09.041
into electricity.

40:07.542 --> 40:09.041
Meaning?

40:09.041 --> 40:12.333
Meaning the microbrain

40:09.041 --> 40:12.333
might be photoelectric.

40:13.834 --> 40:16.500
Kill the lights in

40:13.834 --> 40:16.500
the medical lab, Mr. La Forge.

40:16.500 --> 40:19.208
Let's see if darkness

40:16.500 --> 40:19.208
will neutralize it.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.500
Sorry, sir. It still

40:19.208 --> 40:21.500
has control of the computer.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.583
We can't do it

40:21.500 --> 40:22.583
by remote.

40:22.583 --> 40:24.375
Number One.

40:22.583 --> 40:24.375
Aye, sir.

40:26.834 --> 40:29.625
The life-form must have evolved

40:26.834 --> 40:29.625
at that narrow layer

40:29.625 --> 40:33.125
where the light got through

40:29.625 --> 40:33.125
the sand to the water.

40:33.125 --> 40:38.041
Drop the water

40:33.125 --> 40:38.041
a centimeter below

40:33.125 --> 40:38.041
the light penetration level

40:38.041 --> 40:39.834
and they starve.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.583
(<i> electronic whirring</i> )

40:50.041 --> 40:52.125
Killing the lab lights...

40:52.125 --> 40:53.625
now.

40:57.083 --> 40:59.083
It's slowing down.

41:00.542 --> 41:02.917
It's getting

41:00.542 --> 41:02.917
dimmer, too.

41:04.375 --> 41:07.375
MICROBRAIN:

41:04.375 --> 41:07.375
More light, please.

41:07.375 --> 41:09.917
Only if you will talk to us.

41:09.917 --> 41:12.083
We die.

41:12.083 --> 41:15.667
Bags of water kill us.

41:15.667 --> 41:19.875
You are like others.

41:19.875 --> 41:21.667
We have no wish to kill you.

41:21.667 --> 41:22.875
We never have.

41:22.875 --> 41:26.291
You do not say truth.

41:26.291 --> 41:28.667
We will end this war

41:28.667 --> 41:30.792
if you will end the war.

41:30.792 --> 41:35.041
Darkness... death... terrible.

41:35.041 --> 41:40.250
Must go home to wet sand.

41:40.250 --> 41:43.959
War over.

41:43.959 --> 41:45.792
Agreed.

41:45.792 --> 41:49.208
We will send you home

41:45.792 --> 41:49.208
to your wet sand.

41:49.208 --> 41:51.750
Picard to Riker.

41:51.750 --> 41:53.625
Bring up the lights

41:51.750 --> 41:53.625
in the lab...

41:53.625 --> 41:54.917
just a bit.

42:01.792 --> 42:03.625
Are you better?

42:03.625 --> 42:05.458
Better.

42:05.458 --> 42:07.959
PICARD:

42:05.458 --> 42:07.959
We mean you no harm.

42:07.959 --> 42:09.959
Do you believe me?

42:09.959 --> 42:11.208
Yes.

42:11.208 --> 42:12.917
Good.

42:12.917 --> 42:16.583
It is important

42:12.917 --> 42:16.583
that you trust us.

42:16.583 --> 42:19.000
Not yet.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.083
You are still too arrogant,

42:23.083 --> 42:25.041
too primitive.

42:25.041 --> 42:30.041
Come back three centuries.

42:30.041 --> 42:34.291
Perhaps then we trust.

42:37.792 --> 42:41.500
We understand

42:37.792 --> 42:41.500
what you are saying.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.500
We will leave you.

42:45.417 --> 42:47.959
We will send you home.

43:09.750 --> 43:12.500
Riker to Transporter Chief.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.166
Pick up the coordinates

43:12.500 --> 43:14.166
of the bell jar

43:14.166 --> 43:18.750
in the medical lab

43:14.166 --> 43:18.750
for return to Velara III.

43:18.750 --> 43:21.083
Coordinates entered, sir.

43:28.333 --> 43:29.792
Riker to Bridge.

43:31.291 --> 43:32.709
Captain...

43:34.208 --> 43:38.417
we're ready to beam it

43:34.208 --> 43:38.417
back to the planet.

43:38.417 --> 43:40.917
DATA:

43:38.417 --> 43:40.917
<i>I wish we were able</i>

43:38.417 --> 43:40.917
<i>to learn more about them, sir.</i>

43:40.917 --> 43:45.000
In time, Mr. Data,

43:40.917 --> 43:45.000
when we are better prepared.

43:46.709 --> 43:51.208
I wanted to create

43:46.709 --> 43:51.208
a place where living

43:46.709 --> 43:51.208
things could thrive,

43:51.208 --> 43:52.959
and all the while

43:52.959 --> 43:57.667
I was about to destroy

43:52.959 --> 43:57.667
the life that is there.

43:57.667 --> 43:59.750
Our apologies.

43:59.750 --> 44:01.792
And respects.

44:01.792 --> 44:02.792
Lieutenant Yar?

44:02.792 --> 44:04.625
Coordinates set, sir.

44:07.208 --> 44:08.875
Energize.

44:18.458 --> 44:22.417
<i>Captain's Log,</i>

44:18.458 --> 44:22.417
<i>Stardate 41464.8:</i>

44:22.417 --> 44:26.041
<i>I have declared an indefinite</i>

44:22.417 --> 44:26.041
<i>quarantine for Velara III,</i>

44:26.041 --> 44:27.875
<i>and we are now returning</i>

44:26.041 --> 44:27.875
<i>to Starbase</i>

44:27.875 --> 44:30.166
<i>with the three surviving</i>

44:27.875 --> 44:30.166
<i>terraformers.</i>

44:30.166 --> 44:33.083
<i>Perhaps the lesson we have</i>

44:30.166 --> 44:33.083
<i>learned from this near tragedy</i>

44:33.083 --> 44:36.291
<i>will prevent it</i>

44:33.083 --> 44:36.291
<i>from happening elsewhere.</i>
