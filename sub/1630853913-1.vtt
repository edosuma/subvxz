00:11.886 --> 00:15.598
<i> It's hard to know</i>
<i>what's going on inside the mind of a cat.</i>

00:16.349 --> 00:18.727
-Dasha, come here.Come here.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.983
<i>But new discoveries</i>
<i>may finally open the door</i>

00:25.066 --> 00:27.360
<i>to our most puzzling companions.</i>

00:34.075 --> 00:34.909
Aw.

00:38.371 --> 00:41.291
<i> Some people don't think</i>
<i>cats have much to offer.</i>

00:46.421 --> 00:48.631
<i>We're here to prove them wrong.</i>

01:00.810 --> 01:03.354
<i>Forget everything you think</i>
<i>you know about cats.</i>

01:05.273 --> 01:07.859
Cat research is definitely lagging
behind the dog,

01:07.942 --> 01:11.821
but now we're seeing
an explosion of cat science.

01:12.989 --> 01:17.410
<i> A new generation of scientists</i>
<i>is challenging preconceptions.</i>

01:17.494 --> 01:20.288
We're uncovering different aspects
of their behavior,

01:20.371 --> 01:21.956
personality, physiology,

01:22.040 --> 01:24.417
-all those things that make a cat unique.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.129
They're intelligent,
they're curious,

01:28.213 --> 01:30.381
and they interact socially
quite well with people.

01:31.341 --> 01:34.761
And there is evidence to suggest
that they've evolved to do that.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.724
<i> Join us</i>
<i>as we solve the mysteries of the cat…</i>

01:40.975 --> 01:43.520
<i>…decode their crazy antics,</i>

01:44.062 --> 01:45.980
<i>and decipher their hidden language.</i>

01:48.483 --> 01:49.734
<i>It's not gonna be easy.</i>

01:50.693 --> 01:52.028
<i>Cats are complicated.</i>

01:52.112 --> 01:54.239
-Dasha, come here.

01:54.739 --> 01:55.907
Yes, they have their attitude.

01:57.909 --> 02:01.412
But if you want,
you can teach a cat to do anything.

02:08.503 --> 02:11.214
<i>Anyone can unlock</i>
<i>a cat's true potential</i>

02:12.090 --> 02:13.675
<i>if you learn their secrets.</i>

02:30.066 --> 02:31.776
<i>Cats are everywhere.</i>

02:33.486 --> 02:35.655
<i>And yet, we know so little about them.</i>

02:36.865 --> 02:40.410
<i>To understand what makes a cat a cat</i>

02:40.493 --> 02:42.579
<i>and how they've learned to live</i>
<i>with humans…</i>

02:42.662 --> 02:44.497
<i>-…we turn to the experts.</i>

02:51.588 --> 02:53.298
I think people underestimate

02:53.381 --> 02:54.716
how social cats are.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.760
Let's face it. They're just entertaining

02:57.844 --> 02:59.888
and sometimes just very funny.

03:03.766 --> 03:07.020
<i> Oddly, some of the traits</i>
<i>that make them so charming</i>

03:07.103 --> 03:09.480
<i>evolved from their killer ancestors.</i>

03:10.732 --> 03:16.696
If one were asked
to engineer the perfect land predator

03:16.779 --> 03:21.075
in terms of physical traits,
in terms of behavior, perception,

03:22.493 --> 03:24.370
it's hard to imagine
a better one than the cat.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.376
The scientific name
of the domestic cat is <i>Felis catus.</i>

03:31.252 --> 03:34.881
<i>Felis catus</i> is
a unique domesticated species

03:35.548 --> 03:37.967
that was derived from the African wildcat.

03:40.803 --> 03:44.599
<i> All cats, big and small,</i>
<i>belong to the </i>Felidae <i>family.</i>

03:46.851 --> 03:49.103
<i>Around three and a half million years ago,</i>

03:49.187 --> 03:53.566
<i>the genus </i>Felis, <i>made up of smaller cats,</i>
<i>split from </i>Panthera,

03:53.650 --> 03:56.027
<i>big cats like lions and tigers.</i>

03:58.279 --> 04:02.575
<i>Today, there are</i>
<i>400 million </i>Felis catus <i>worldwide,</i>

04:03.993 --> 04:07.372
<i>numbers that make them</i>
<i>one of the ten most successful mammals</i>

04:08.164 --> 04:09.999
<i>to ever walk the earth.</i>

04:11.125 --> 04:15.046
In ten thousand years,
their DNA has changed relatively little.

04:16.464 --> 04:21.177
Genetics-wise, you basically have
a wild animal living in your house.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.849
<i> A wild animal</i>
<i>with some amazing physical hardware.</i>

04:28.559 --> 04:32.230
<i>And at the center of it all,</i>
<i>the cat's remarkable spine.</i>

04:33.564 --> 04:36.734
They actually have
more vertebrae in them than most mammals.

04:37.318 --> 04:41.239
Their vertebrae also have
especially elastic cushioning discs

04:41.322 --> 04:44.325
between them, so their spines
are incredibly flexible.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.829
<i>This flexible design</i>
<i>helps make the cat</i>

04:47.912 --> 04:49.622
<i>the fastest animal on land.</i>

04:51.624 --> 04:54.002
If you look at a cheetah running,

04:54.085 --> 04:57.922
the flexing and contracting
of that spine stores potential energy

04:58.006 --> 05:01.968
and releases it as kinetic energy
as the cat is bounding forward.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.934
<i> Your cat is basically</i>
<i>a tiny, flexible cheetah</i>

05:11.311 --> 05:14.063
<i>with the potential to run</i>
<i>over 30 miles per hour…</i>

05:16.441 --> 05:19.360
<i>and twist into</i>
<i>some pretty crazy yoga poses.</i>

05:22.864 --> 05:25.992
<i>Cats also have</i>
<i>an efficient muscular system.</i>

05:26.701 --> 05:30.079
<i>They're one of the few mammals</i>
<i>that can activate 100%</i>

05:30.163 --> 05:32.123
<i>of their muscles when they jump.</i>

05:32.206 --> 05:34.459
<i> Ignition sequence start.</i>

05:34.542 --> 05:38.713
<i>Three, two, one, liftoff.</i>

05:38.796 --> 05:40.590
<i>We have a liftoff.</i>

05:41.424 --> 05:45.386
They can jump between five
and six times their length in height.

05:46.512 --> 05:49.182
<i> That's like a human</i>
<i>jumping over a giraffe.</i>

05:53.019 --> 05:55.938
And they use their tails
to counterbalance themselves

05:56.022 --> 05:57.732
during quick changes in direction.

06:00.777 --> 06:05.073
<i> As any gymnast will tell you,</i>
<i>what goes up must come down,</i>

06:05.823 --> 06:07.950
<i>which brings up an age-old question.</i>

06:09.285 --> 06:11.454
The saying is
that cats always land on their feet.

06:13.623 --> 06:17.210
They do have an amazing ability
to orient themselves quickly.

06:17.293 --> 06:18.795
In order to do this,

06:18.878 --> 06:22.090
they first have to recognize
where their body is in space,

06:22.173 --> 06:25.218
using a phenomenon known
as the righting reflex.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.311
<i> This reflex is</i>
<i>a function of the vestibular system.</i>

06:38.564 --> 06:41.150
<i>Hypersensitive hair cells</i>
<i>in the inner ears</i>

06:41.234 --> 06:45.154
<i>sense body position,</i>
<i>movement, and acceleration in space</i>

06:45.863 --> 06:48.533
<i>and transmit this information</i>
<i>straight into the brain.</i>

06:49.951 --> 06:53.079
So a cat always knows which way is up.

06:57.291 --> 07:00.628
<i> All mammals have</i>
<i>this righting reflex, including humans.</i>

07:01.754 --> 07:04.006
<i>But sometimes, we get disoriented.</i>

07:04.590 --> 07:06.884
<i>And we call that the twisties.</i>

07:07.552 --> 07:10.138
-You heard this thing about Simone Biles.

07:12.348 --> 07:17.228
She felt like she had lost the ability
to sense where her body was in space.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.441
And she felt that to continue
would've been dangerous,

07:21.524 --> 07:22.775
which makes sense.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.820
But, uh, you know,
it's a difficult thing to control.

07:27.822 --> 07:31.325
<i> A cat's reflexes are</i>
<i>more than twice as fast as ours…</i>

07:33.870 --> 07:36.080
<i>and faster than any other pet's.</i>

07:37.665 --> 07:42.211
You know, if you drop a dog
from the same position, and many times,

07:42.295 --> 07:44.464
they won't land on their feet.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.346
<i> Pound for pound,</i>
<i>felines could be the fastest,</i>

07:52.430 --> 07:55.808
<i>strongest, and most flexible mammal</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

08:00.062 --> 08:04.066
<i>But those wild talents</i>
<i>can also make them mysterious.</i>

08:08.404 --> 08:10.656
<i>-To find out why they do what they do…</i>

08:11.407 --> 08:13.367
<i>…perhaps a cat psychologist can help.</i>

08:14.285 --> 08:15.912
Sit back. There you go, sweetie.

08:19.957 --> 08:23.294
Over evolution,
cats have not changed all that much.

08:24.086 --> 08:28.174
And now they're kind of this mix
between, you know, being those wild cats

08:28.257 --> 08:30.843
but also being the house cats
that we want them to be.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.724
<i> Kristyn studies the mysteries</i>
<i>of the feline mind.</i>

08:37.475 --> 08:40.228
<i>She's trying to decode</i>
<i>what cats are thinking.</i>

08:41.938 --> 08:46.067
I think that the social capacity of cats
has really been underestimated.

08:46.567 --> 08:50.571
Um, especially, you know, a lot of time,
cats are being compared to dogs.

08:54.992 --> 08:59.330
People say dogs are superior
on a lot of these socio-cognitive traits.

09:00.873 --> 09:04.835
<i> Canines are often thought of</i>
<i>as the more intuitive pet.</i>

09:06.879 --> 09:10.049
<i>They know their name</i>
<i>and as many as 160 or so words.</i>

09:11.676 --> 09:13.928
<i>They can understand</i>
<i>human facial expressions</i>

09:14.011 --> 09:15.930
<i>and maybe even problem-solve.</i>

09:17.723 --> 09:22.270
<i>But Kristyn believes cats just haven't had</i>
<i>the chance to prove themselves.</i>

09:22.353 --> 09:23.187
Be nice.

09:23.896 --> 09:27.692
What we're seeing more and more
is the research hadn't been done in cats.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.988
<i> So she set out to determine</i>
<i>once and for all</i>

09:32.071 --> 09:35.366
<i>just how cats stack up</i>
<i>against their canine rivals.</i>

09:36.576 --> 09:38.578
So we're just gonna place him up here.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.914
<i> First things first,</i>
<i>do cats know their own name?</i>

09:43.958 --> 09:47.587
For this test, we're trying to figure out
if Carl recognizes his name.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.967
So we've got this Bluetooth speaker,

09:53.050 --> 09:55.469
and we're going to play
my voice through it.

09:58.222 --> 10:01.267
<i> Kristyn starts</i>
<i>with four one-syllable words.</i>

10:02.351 --> 10:03.269
Boot!

10:04.395 --> 10:06.480
<i> Carl reacts to the first word,</i>

10:06.981 --> 10:08.649
<i>a new sound in his environment.</i>

10:09.609 --> 10:10.860
Sock!

10:12.111 --> 10:14.697
<i>But he soon loses interest in the audio.</i>

10:15.281 --> 10:16.157
Day!

10:19.910 --> 10:22.830
<i> Kristyn then adds a word</i>
<i>very close to his name.</i>

10:24.582 --> 10:25.499
Girl!

10:28.669 --> 10:29.920
<i> Still nothing.</i>

10:33.591 --> 10:35.885
<i>But then, the moment of truth.</i>

10:37.595 --> 10:38.512
Carl!

10:39.764 --> 10:41.307
Good!

10:42.808 --> 10:45.519
<i> This test has been run</i>
<i>hundreds of times</i>

10:45.603 --> 10:47.021
<i>with many different cats.</i>

10:47.938 --> 10:51.651
<i>And it's clear</i>
<i>most cats do know their own name.</i>

10:54.153 --> 10:57.406
<i>Whether they choose to respond</i>
<i>is a different story.</i>

10:58.032 --> 10:58.866
Go ahead.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.660
<i>But we'll talk about that later.</i>

11:02.828 --> 11:05.456
<i>Kristyn's research</i>
<i>led her to the epicenter</i>

11:05.539 --> 11:07.750
<i>of a modern-day cat revolution.</i>

11:23.516 --> 11:28.771
<i>In 2017, cats overtook canines</i>
<i>as the most popular pet in Japan.</i>

11:35.861 --> 11:38.906
<i>Today it's home to nine million pet cats</i>

11:39.657 --> 11:42.660
<i>and one of the world's top cat scientists.</i>

11:48.541 --> 11:51.043
Compared with the research on dogs,

11:51.127 --> 11:56.507
the research on cats
is approximately 15 years behind.

11:57.133 --> 12:01.846
<i> Kristyn and Saho</i>
<i>have published 37 studies combined.</i>

12:02.805 --> 12:04.849
<i>They've helped prove that cats recognize</i>

12:04.932 --> 12:07.810
<i>both the face</i>
<i>and the voice of their people,</i>

12:07.893 --> 12:09.770
<i>not to mention other cats.</i>

12:10.896 --> 12:13.858
<i>They proved that cats</i>
<i>do know what a point means.</i>

12:14.608 --> 12:17.236
<i>They understand object permanence.</i>

12:17.319 --> 12:20.364
They are able to understand
that when an object disappears from sight,

12:20.448 --> 12:22.783
it doesn't mean it's gone from existence.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.078
<i>Bottom line,</i>
<i>they understand way more</i>

12:26.162 --> 12:27.496
<i>than we thought they did.</i>

12:28.289 --> 12:30.666
Now that the research is being conducted,

12:30.750 --> 12:35.713
we're seeing cats are behaving
and performing roughly the same as dogs.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.884
<i> The trick is knowing</i>
<i>how to tap into that potential.</i>

12:41.385 --> 12:44.388
Maryna and Svitlana interview,
ABC mark.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.940
-My name is Maryna.
-And my name is Svitlana.

12:55.024 --> 12:56.692
And we're the Savitsky Cats.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.695
We are family
of super-trained cats and humans.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.155
Come here.

13:02.406 --> 13:06.285
Training the cats,
it's kind of a magic of some sort.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.371
And it's not an easy one.

13:10.790 --> 13:15.169
<i> The amazing Savitsky Cats</i>
<i>are Ukrainian celebrities.</i>

13:15.252 --> 13:18.214
<i>They tour the world,</i>
<i>entertaining millions.</i>

13:20.841 --> 13:24.386
<i>They made it to the quarterfinals</i>
<i>of </i>America's Got Talent,<i> by the way.</i>

13:25.930 --> 13:29.391
<i>Not bad for an animal</i>
<i>often considered untrainable.</i>

13:30.976 --> 13:35.147
The difference between training a cat
and training a dog is

13:35.231 --> 13:37.191
the dogs want to please you.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.947
"I will do anything for you!
I will do… just… just say me."

13:43.030 --> 13:45.825
And the cats just kind of,
"Make me."

13:46.951 --> 13:48.577
<i>The Savitskys know the key</i>

13:48.661 --> 13:50.913
<i>to getting the most</i>
<i>out of their performers.</i>

13:51.789 --> 13:54.959
First of all,
you need to become friends with the kitty.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.966
It's important that the cat
trusts you completely.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.552
The cat shouldn't expect
any surprises from you.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.140
<i>For the past four years,</i>

14:10.224 --> 14:12.393
<i>Dasha has been their breakout star.</i>

14:14.061 --> 14:15.479
Oh, Dasha.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.566
Dasha is an actress.

14:21.735 --> 14:26.198
Whenever she sees a camera,
it's kind of like the whole world stops,

14:26.282 --> 14:28.909
and like,
"The camera is the only thing I need."

14:32.037 --> 14:35.124
<i> Dasha performs many</i>
<i>of the team's hardest tricks…</i>

14:37.626 --> 14:39.670
<i>including the Mission Impossible…</i>

14:43.549 --> 14:45.217
<i>and the high jump.</i>

14:58.564 --> 15:02.693
<i>Dasha is the undisputed captain</i>
<i>of the Savitsky Cats.</i>

15:03.986 --> 15:07.489
<i>But there are three other candidates</i>
<i>vying to take her spot.</i>

15:08.991 --> 15:12.244
<i>And any one of them</i>
<i>could be the next big star.</i>

15:14.246 --> 15:17.166
Each cat is kind of our own child,

15:17.249 --> 15:20.085
and we cannot imagine our life without it.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.465
<i> The only way to bring out</i>
<i>the best in a feline</i>

15:24.548 --> 15:26.342
<i>is to establish a bond.</i>

15:27.927 --> 15:31.805
<i>Some doctors dedicate</i>
<i>their lives to this art form.</i>

15:37.811 --> 15:40.439
Before a person adopts a cat
or purchases a cat,

15:40.522 --> 15:42.399
you want them to do some homework, right?

15:42.483 --> 15:45.611
You want them
to kind of look at what to expect

15:45.694 --> 15:47.446
when you bring home a cat.

15:47.529 --> 15:51.116
It's a big decision 'cause you're adding
a valuable family member.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.786
Adding a cat is a huge deal.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.915
<i> The learning curve</i>
<i>can be steep for beginners.</i>

16:00.000 --> 16:01.418
If you want your cat to like you,

16:01.502 --> 16:05.214
one of the very first things you can do
is a slow blink.

16:07.299 --> 16:10.761
Eye contact in the animal world
is very important.

16:10.844 --> 16:15.015
Direct eye contact,
a hard stare, non-blinking, is scary.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.644
-If you want to interact with a cat…

16:18.727 --> 16:22.523
…make yourself look small,
kind of move sideways, stand sideways.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.818
And, you know,
you can look over and do a blink.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.321
<i>To cats, this is like smiling,</i>

16:29.947 --> 16:32.366
<i>spreading happy, positive emotions.</i>

16:32.992 --> 16:34.410
<i>And they will often respond.</i>

16:35.953 --> 16:40.499
So they do the… slow blink
to tell you, "Hey, it's okay."

16:40.582 --> 16:43.085
"I'm friendly. You know, I like you."

16:43.168 --> 16:45.254
"I'm not… I'm not being threatening."

16:45.963 --> 16:48.882
And when cats do that,
like, I think of it as a compliment.

16:48.966 --> 16:51.176
"Oh, that cat likes me. Yeah."

16:51.260 --> 16:54.888
<i> If the slow blink works,</i>
<i>you can try to get a little closer.</i>

16:55.973 --> 16:58.475
Cats,
when they greet each other,

16:58.559 --> 17:01.729
cats that are friendly to each other,
will do nose touches.

17:01.812 --> 17:04.398
They will literally come up
and touch noses.

17:04.982 --> 17:08.569
If you wanna get to know your cat,
you can offer your finger to them

17:08.652 --> 17:10.654
and let them kind of do like a nose boop.

17:12.906 --> 17:16.452
They're sniffing your finger,
getting your scent, getting to know you.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.997
And that's kind of like,
for me, like a handshake.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.666
But if they like you,
what frequently happens

17:22.750 --> 17:24.668
is they'll rub along your finger.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.755
<i>Just don't come in hot from above.</i>

17:28.255 --> 17:33.427
Going back to, you know,
their wild ancestors, they are part prey.

17:33.510 --> 17:37.723
So what attacks them from above?
Things that come out with claws.

17:38.724 --> 17:42.478
You know, large raptors, owls,
eagles, things like that.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.897
So when you come over
with your hand like this,

17:44.980 --> 17:47.149
it's kind of scary, very intimidating.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.235
<i> Low and slow is the way to go.</i>

17:51.737 --> 17:54.198
I usually put the finger out
and let them sniff.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.742
And if they start rubbing,
then I go and pet

17:56.825 --> 17:58.535
along the side of their face,

17:58.619 --> 18:01.997
underneath the chin,
neutral territory, right?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.500
And if they like chin rubs
or neck rubs, right,

18:04.583 --> 18:08.170
then you got the cat
eating out of the palm of your hand.

18:09.254 --> 18:13.175
<i> Some cats, wary of contact,</i>
<i>need a little extra convincing.</i>

18:14.259 --> 18:16.345
A lot of cats are very fearful,

18:16.428 --> 18:21.016
so what we do is we have, uh…
we have a pom-pom.

18:21.100 --> 18:25.062
It's a little ball of yarn
stuck to a long dowel.

18:25.145 --> 18:29.483
We use that to initiate interactions
with the cat

18:29.566 --> 18:34.029
and let them interact with that first
to see how the cat feels.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.032
<i> When a cat is comfortable,</i>
<i>they let you know.</i>

18:37.699 --> 18:41.036
Allorubbing is an important
bond-building social behavior.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.247
-We saw that 83% of cats

18:43.330 --> 18:45.582
rubbed on their owner
when they returned to the room.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.918
We are seeing
that allorubbing seems to serve

18:48.001 --> 18:50.879
an important stress-relieving purpose
for cats as well.

18:51.547 --> 18:55.175
<i> This friendly gesture</i>
<i>might just mean you've been accepted.</i>

18:56.552 --> 18:58.637
<i>But do cats like all humans?</i>

18:59.596 --> 19:02.182
<i>Or do they play favorites?</i>

19:02.975 --> 19:07.020
This test is called paired attachment,
and in it, what we do is look at

19:07.104 --> 19:11.400
how much time the cat spends
with their owner and a stranger.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.448
<i>If Carl chooses Kristyn, his owner,</i>

19:18.532 --> 19:21.243
<i>over the stranger more than half the time,</i>

19:21.326 --> 19:23.537
<i>it'll show there's a preference.</i>

19:38.260 --> 19:40.554
Carl basically chose me every time.

19:40.637 --> 19:44.308
And so he seems to have
a preference for me, his owner,

19:44.391 --> 19:45.726
over a stranger.

19:47.603 --> 19:51.982
<i> They've run this experiment</i>
<i>and others like it thousands of times.</i>

19:52.691 --> 19:54.109
<i>And there's no doubt</i>

19:54.193 --> 19:57.446
<i>cats form strong attachment bonds</i>
<i>to their owners.</i>

19:59.156 --> 20:02.534
The human-cat attachment bond
may be an extension

20:02.618 --> 20:05.829
of that attachment bond
they have with their mother as kittens.

20:06.455 --> 20:09.791
<i> Yes, we have a connection,</i>
<i>and we certainly love them.</i>

20:10.417 --> 20:12.711
<i>But do cats actually love us?</i>

20:14.546 --> 20:16.215
<i>We'll explore that more in a bit.</i>

20:18.759 --> 20:21.678
<i>First, another key</i>
<i>to unlocking the feline mind</i>

20:21.762 --> 20:23.639
<i>is to make them feel at home.</i>

20:25.891 --> 20:29.269
<i>And just like their ancestors,</i>
<i>cats like to get high.</i>

20:30.562 --> 20:33.941
Cats like high places
because they want to know what's going on.

20:34.524 --> 20:39.029
And if they're uncomfortable,
they can go to high places to hide out.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.618
It's definitely a leftover trait
from when they were wild cats, right?

20:44.701 --> 20:48.830
This is-- Those are instinctive behavior.
You don't need to teach a cat to climb.

20:48.914 --> 20:52.125
He's gonna tell you, "I'm gonna climb,"
and if you don't provide him

20:52.209 --> 20:55.170
with cat furniture
that's appropriate for him to use,

20:55.254 --> 20:57.798
he's gonna make his own little perch.

20:57.881 --> 21:01.343
No, you haven't. You haven't!

21:01.843 --> 21:04.263
<i> Cats also like tight spaces,</i>

21:05.222 --> 21:08.016
<i>which helps explain</i>
<i>their obsession with boxes.</i>

21:09.559 --> 21:12.813
Those enclosed sides
makes us feel safe.

21:12.896 --> 21:15.857
I think that's why cats
really like boxes, and it's kind of cool

21:15.941 --> 21:18.777
to hide and jump out
and attack your owners.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.867
Cats are ambush predators,

21:25.951 --> 21:29.329
which means that they typically hide
in order to get their prey.

21:30.038 --> 21:34.418
So having a box is something
that's going to kind of help the cat

21:34.501 --> 21:36.503
complete their predatory motor pattern.

21:38.422 --> 21:42.884
Cardboard boxes actually have
a stress-relieving effect for them.

21:45.595 --> 21:48.223
Cats occupy kind of an interesting niche

21:48.307 --> 21:54.146
in ecology because when they're hunting,
they may be going into holes in trees.

21:54.229 --> 21:56.565
-They're navigating obstacles.

21:58.525 --> 22:01.820
A predator
that is able to navigate obstacles

22:01.903 --> 22:03.739
is probably gonna do better.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.950
Clearly,
that's gonna be a survival benefit.

22:08.243 --> 22:09.995
<i> Cats have specialized assets</i>

22:10.078 --> 22:12.956
<i>that help them squeeze</i>
<i>where few animals can.</i>

22:15.417 --> 22:19.880
One way we can demonstrate
this ability is to see

22:20.464 --> 22:23.091
how small a hole a cat can get through.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.260
And we can entice them to go through holes

22:25.344 --> 22:28.388
with things like food
and toys and treats like that.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.405
<i>Large holes are no problem.</i>

22:47.991 --> 22:50.494
<i>But as Bruce shrinks the size of the hole,</i>

22:50.577 --> 22:53.830
<i>they begin to show</i>
<i>their true mastery of their environment.</i>

22:56.958 --> 22:59.294
<i>And it all starts with the whiskers.</i>

23:01.004 --> 23:04.132
Now, whiskers are
a very interesting adaptation of cats.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.551
As most people know them,
they look like hairs.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.428
They're long, hairlike structures,

23:08.512 --> 23:12.474
each of which is connected
to a bundle of nerves

23:12.557 --> 23:16.770
that then sends information regarding
what that whisker touches to the brain.

23:17.270 --> 23:19.773
Most people are aware
of whiskers on the chin,

23:19.856 --> 23:22.192
but there are also whiskers
on the eyebrows,

23:22.275 --> 23:24.611
and people aren't aware
that there are whiskers

23:24.694 --> 23:27.531
behind, uh, the backs of the front paws.

23:27.614 --> 23:31.368
So these have evolved to provide
tactile or touching information

23:31.451 --> 23:32.786
regarding the environment.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.415
<i> One benefit of whiskers?</i>

23:36.498 --> 23:39.751
<i>They tell a cat</i>
<i>how small a hole she can fit through.</i>

23:44.464 --> 23:46.508
<i>Their flexible skeleton does the rest.</i>

23:48.844 --> 23:49.719
Their clavicles,

23:49.803 --> 23:53.265
or their collarbones, are not anchored
in bone. They're in muscles.

23:54.015 --> 23:56.643
<i>It's like being double-jointed everywhere.</i>

23:58.687 --> 24:00.814
As you can see
in this experiment,

24:00.897 --> 24:04.860
as we gradually make the hole
smaller and smaller,

24:04.943 --> 24:09.656
it's really pretty surprising
that these cats, which are pretty large,

24:09.739 --> 24:11.116
can make it through.

24:14.870 --> 24:18.874
<i> But whiskers don't grow</i>
<i>if a cat puts on a few extra pounds.</i>

24:20.208 --> 24:24.963
The whiskershave evolved to be
about the width of a cat

24:25.046 --> 24:27.674
that is a normal, healthy body condition.

24:28.425 --> 24:33.138
And this gets to another issue
of being overweight and obesity in cats,

24:33.221 --> 24:36.349
and many cats are obese, uh,
and it's a big problem.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.478
The whiskers will not grow

24:39.561 --> 24:43.190
to accommodate the increased girth
of a cat that is overweight.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.612
<i> Fifty-nine percent of cats</i>
<i>in the US are overweight.</i>

24:49.362 --> 24:51.907
<i>So finding the right diet is crucial.</i>

24:55.452 --> 24:57.204
<i>Our cats' wild relatives</i>

24:57.287 --> 24:59.122
<i>have to work for their food.</i>

24:59.873 --> 25:01.875
<i>They have no trouble staying slim.</i>

25:03.043 --> 25:05.545
<i>Our cats, not so much.</i>

25:06.338 --> 25:08.590
Do you wanna set him on the scale?

25:09.925 --> 25:11.218
No cheating.

25:11.968 --> 25:14.429
If you're eating and eating and eating,

25:14.513 --> 25:15.764
and you eat quickly, you know,

25:15.847 --> 25:18.975
you can get a lot of food down your throat

25:19.059 --> 25:21.895
before your stomach goes,
"Oh, wait, too much." Right?

25:21.978 --> 25:25.273
So we wanna do the same for cats.
We wanna give them something to do.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.817
So, either a cat toy, uh,

25:27.901 --> 25:31.321
feeding… interactive feeder,
but something they can work on

25:31.404 --> 25:33.073
so they know there's food in there.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.408
Dude, you got to work for it.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.496
<i>Also, regardless of what their owners eat,</i>

25:39.579 --> 25:41.414
<i>cats need to eat meat.</i>

25:43.083 --> 25:45.001
Cats are obligate carnivores.

25:45.085 --> 25:48.838
They… they must eat meat
because they are unable to synthesize

25:48.922 --> 25:51.299
certain amino acids
that are found only in meat.

25:52.092 --> 25:55.387
So please, make sure that you feed
your cat a meat-based diet.

25:55.470 --> 25:58.223
It has to be
nutritionally complete and balanced,

25:58.306 --> 26:00.141
but please don't make it vegetarian.

26:03.687 --> 26:05.939
<i>Keeping your cat healthy and happy</i>

26:06.022 --> 26:08.024
<i>can quickly become a way of life.</i>

26:14.656 --> 26:18.410
<i>One doctor in Japan</i>
<i>spends so much time around felines</i>

26:19.411 --> 26:21.955
<i>they call him the Cat Guru.</i>

26:29.629 --> 26:33.883
Cats are sensitive animals.

26:33.967 --> 26:36.469
People who do not like cats often say

26:36.553 --> 26:41.391
that they don't understand
what cats are thinking.

26:43.226 --> 26:48.106
<i>Dr. Yuki has spent</i>
<i>tens of thousands of hours studying cats.</i>

26:49.524 --> 26:53.695
<i>He's working to decode</i>
<i>the subtle nuance of their language.</i>

26:54.696 --> 26:57.866
If you look at
a cat, at their eyes, their ears,

26:57.949 --> 27:01.494
the way they are wagging their tails,
if you observe them,

27:01.578 --> 27:03.580
you can start understanding
how a cat feels.

27:06.374 --> 27:09.377
<i>When a cat's eyes</i>
<i>are open,</i> <i>and their ears are up,</i>

27:09.461 --> 27:10.503
<i>they're relaxed.</i>

27:11.379 --> 27:14.507
<i>If they narrow their eyes</i>
<i>and lower their ears,</i>

27:14.591 --> 27:16.134
<i>they're becoming aggressive.</i>

27:16.718 --> 27:21.389
<i>Eyes open but ears back means</i>
<i>they're preparing to defend themselves.</i>

27:22.349 --> 27:27.604
<i>And if they bare their teeth,</i>
<i>it means they're ready for an attack.</i>

27:28.688 --> 27:31.358
<i>Reading a cat's face can be intuitive.</i>

27:32.067 --> 27:34.235
<i>The tail is more of a mystery.</i>

27:35.278 --> 27:37.614
Movements of the tail
have various meanings.

27:37.697 --> 27:43.411
When a dog is wagging his tail,
people say that it is happy.

27:43.495 --> 27:44.996
That's not the case for a cat.

27:46.289 --> 27:49.584
<i> When a cat</i>
<i>thrashes its tail, it's annoyed.</i>

27:50.585 --> 27:53.380
<i>But when they hold it straight up,</i>
<i>they're pretty happy.</i>

27:54.464 --> 27:57.967
When I come home,
and a cat is coming towards me,

27:58.051 --> 28:03.515
holding its tail straight up,
it is in a good mood.

28:03.598 --> 28:08.144
It's saying, "Welcome home.
Where have you been? I missed you."

28:09.104 --> 28:11.564
<i>When the tip of their tail is twitching,</i>

28:11.648 --> 28:13.525
<i>it means they're intrigued.</i>

28:14.984 --> 28:17.612
<i>When a cat tucks its tail</i>
<i>between its legs,</i>

28:17.696 --> 28:20.448
<i>it's afraid and trying to look submissive.</i>

28:21.533 --> 28:26.788
<i>When all their hair stands on end,</i>
<i>it means they're downright terrified.</i>

28:27.789 --> 28:30.792
When its tail is fluffed up,
that is true fear!

28:34.754 --> 28:37.257
<i>If you understand</i>
<i>these coded messages,</i>

28:37.340 --> 28:39.175
<i>anyone can read a cat.</i>

28:40.885 --> 28:43.972
<i>And sometimes, it helps just to listen.</i>

28:45.974 --> 28:48.601
A cat has
20 different sounds

28:48.685 --> 28:50.395
to express its emotions.

28:51.062 --> 28:53.940
<i> There are sounds</i>
<i>a cat makes when it wants something…</i>

28:56.776 --> 28:58.987
<i>…and sounds when a cat is happy.</i>

29:04.117 --> 29:08.079
<i>These are warning sounds.</i>
<i>"Don't get too close."</i>

29:10.039 --> 29:10.874
<i>And this…</i>

29:12.542 --> 29:14.210
<i>…is the sound of an attack.</i>

29:15.879 --> 29:20.383
<i>But cats talk to humans</i>
<i>far more than they do other cats.</i>

29:22.051 --> 29:27.223
Cats that live with humans meow a lot.

29:28.224 --> 29:30.685
When a cat meows loudly and clearly once,

29:30.769 --> 29:33.730
it often means
that the cat is demanding something.

29:33.813 --> 29:36.441
"I'm hungry, but there's no food
in my bowl."

29:36.524 --> 29:39.736
"I want water,"
or, "Please open this door."

29:40.487 --> 29:42.697
<i>The most mysterious coded messages</i>

29:42.781 --> 29:44.741
<i>are found in the purr.</i>

29:46.117 --> 29:48.453
When a cat
makes sounds with its throat,

29:48.536 --> 29:49.662
it's feeling really great…

29:51.247 --> 29:54.667
…a little bit enchanted or mesmerized.

29:54.751 --> 29:57.420
That is the sound it makes.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.799
<i>A surprising new study has found</i>

30:00.882 --> 30:04.511
<i>they use their purr</i>
<i>to tap into our subconscious.</i>

30:07.972 --> 30:10.558
They seem to be able to insert frequencies

30:11.434 --> 30:16.689
that overlap with the frequencies
that a human baby makes when it cries.

30:19.901 --> 30:22.529
<i>When a human baby cries, the frequency,</i>

30:22.612 --> 30:24.364
<i>or the length of the sound waves,</i>

30:25.073 --> 30:27.992
<i>is between 400 and 600 hertz…</i>

30:29.369 --> 30:31.830
<i>…a sound designed to get our attention.</i>

30:33.206 --> 30:36.501
<i>Modern cats have developed</i>
<i>a special high-pitched meow</i>

30:36.584 --> 30:40.463
<i>embedded within their purr</i>
<i>that mimics this frequency.</i>

30:40.547 --> 30:42.966
-Aw.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.427
Cats have evolved a way to make

30:46.511 --> 30:49.556
a sound that humans
have a lot of difficulty ignoring.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.143
And so it seems

30:54.227 --> 30:57.897
that that's really tapping into
either the maternal or paternal instinct

30:57.981 --> 31:00.275
of the owner to care for the cat.

31:01.943 --> 31:04.529
<i>They've evolved to make us care for them.</i>

31:06.030 --> 31:10.159
<i>But there are still things</i>
<i>we can do to get them to listen to us.</i>

31:12.787 --> 31:17.584
The first and the basic command
that we teach cats to do is following us.

31:17.667 --> 31:23.423
So we can run off from them
and say, "Come to me," and they will come.

31:24.507 --> 31:26.885
<i> Teaching simple commands</i>
<i>through repetition</i>

31:26.968 --> 31:29.220
<i>is known as classical conditioning.</i>

31:30.680 --> 31:35.935
So the classical example
of classical conditioning is from Pavlov.

31:37.937 --> 31:40.815
<i>Dr. Ivan Pavlov won the Nobel Prize</i>

31:40.899 --> 31:43.610
<i>for physiology in 1904 for his discovery.</i>

31:45.445 --> 31:47.614
What he learned was that

31:47.697 --> 31:52.327
if you ring a bell
when you offer a dog food,

31:52.410 --> 31:55.914
after repeated pairings,
the sound of the bell

31:55.997 --> 31:58.249
will start causing the dog to salivate.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.544
So the dog got conditioned that

32:01.628 --> 32:04.422
hearing the bell means food's gonna come.

32:04.505 --> 32:06.341
So that's classical conditioning.

32:07.508 --> 32:10.428
<i> For cats,</i>
<i>clicker training is a good place to start.</i>

32:11.930 --> 32:13.723
You wanna offer a click sound,

32:13.806 --> 32:16.517
and within a second or two,
offer the cat a treat,

32:16.601 --> 32:18.519
so the cat goes, "Oh, hey."

32:18.603 --> 32:22.231
"Every time I hear the click,
I get to eat my special treat."

32:22.315 --> 32:25.026
So then that click becomes meaningful.

32:26.903 --> 32:30.406
<i> Cats get bored easily,</i>
<i>so keep training sessions short.</i>

32:32.033 --> 32:35.536
I would aim anywhere
between one to five minutes.

32:35.620 --> 32:38.206
I… I would be… It would be, like,

32:39.165 --> 32:41.626
exceedingly awesome
if we get five minutes.

32:41.709 --> 32:45.797
Quite honestly, I tell my owners,
like, "30 to 60 seconds, hallelujah!"

32:45.880 --> 32:47.382
"We got it!" You know?

32:47.465 --> 32:50.259
If your cat can do more than that,
that's great.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.971
<i> It's important to be patient.</i>

32:53.471 --> 32:55.723
<i>Not all cats respond the same way.</i>

32:56.975 --> 32:58.685
<i>Because all cats are different.</i>

33:00.436 --> 33:04.440
In our research, one thing
that we're seeing in a lot of cat behavior

33:04.524 --> 33:07.318
is that there's
a lot of individual variability.

33:07.402 --> 33:13.741
So cats really differ on their response
to people and their sociability.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.620
<i> Not all cats are superstars.</i>

33:20.456 --> 33:23.668
<i>Dasha got to where she is</i>
<i>through years of training.</i>

33:26.879 --> 33:30.425
<i>The other Savitsky Cats</i>
<i>are still a work in progress.</i>

33:35.346 --> 33:38.683
Not every cat can do special tricks.

33:38.766 --> 33:43.312
You must observe the cat
to understand what she is capable of

33:43.396 --> 33:46.274
and teach them things
based on their strengths.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.195
When animals are born,
they're born with a temperament.

33:54.407 --> 33:57.118
That temperament is
the initial building blocks

33:57.201 --> 34:01.372
for that personality that's going to
develop over their lifetime.

34:01.456 --> 34:04.667
All of our cats have
different personalities,

34:04.751 --> 34:06.586
and you need to adjust to them,

34:06.669 --> 34:10.715
so you cannot make them adjust to you.

34:10.798 --> 34:13.301
It's kind of not their job. It's yours.

34:13.384 --> 34:15.344
So you need to pick

34:16.262 --> 34:17.972
what works for them better.

34:19.557 --> 34:22.518
We see actually in kittens that already

34:22.602 --> 34:24.687
by the age of three days old,

34:24.771 --> 34:27.148
they're showing differences
within their litter.

34:31.110 --> 34:35.114
It's like
with humans. Some are great at computers.

34:35.198 --> 34:38.201
Some can be great ballerinas.

34:38.284 --> 34:41.996
You wouldn't teach computers
to a ballerina.

34:45.249 --> 34:48.336
Eddy, come here! Eddy!

34:49.587 --> 34:52.298
<i> The Savitskys</i>
<i>don't force their performers</i>

34:52.381 --> 34:54.050
<i>to do these amazing stunts.</i>

34:55.593 --> 34:59.138
<i>Like a sculptor who finds</i>
<i>the sculpture within the rock,</i>

34:59.764 --> 35:03.101
<i>they let each cat's potential</i>
<i>reveal itself.</i>

35:06.145 --> 35:09.732
This is Asia. She is a diva.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.400
Come on, come on.

35:11.484 --> 35:14.153
You never know, will she perform or not?

35:15.655 --> 35:17.115
Yet you never know.

35:17.198 --> 35:20.034
She's kind of, like,
really, really difficult.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.538
But the tricks she's doing,
they are really amazing.

35:23.621 --> 35:25.540
So it's worth the risk.

35:27.959 --> 35:32.255
<i> At 13, the senior member</i>
<i>of the team is a fan favorite.</i>

35:33.548 --> 35:34.715
This is Chupa.

35:35.341 --> 35:40.721
She was veryhard to train
in the beginning, like, very challenging.

35:41.305 --> 35:43.558
She didn't get it, like, at all.

35:43.641 --> 35:47.562
But a few months passed,
and, like, just it clicked.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.399
And now she is a great student.

35:53.276 --> 35:56.654
You definitely can teach
old cats to do tricks.

35:58.948 --> 36:03.077
<i> Their newest recruit, Eddy,</i>
<i>had a slightly different upbringing.</i>

36:04.620 --> 36:05.997
Eddy, it's a girl name.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.833
Uh, and she grew up with the dogs,

36:08.916 --> 36:14.547
so most of her life,
she has the doglike habits and behavior.

36:16.757 --> 36:19.385
We do know that life experience

36:19.468 --> 36:21.762
really does impact the cat's behavior.

36:22.471 --> 36:26.434
And that also impacts
how social the cat is.

36:30.605 --> 36:32.148
<i> Because of her background,</i>

36:32.231 --> 36:35.151
<i>the Savitskys train Eddy</i>
<i>a bit differently.</i>

36:38.654 --> 36:40.781
She's doing everything backwards.

36:42.450 --> 36:45.536
So she's doing, like, really crazy stuff

36:45.620 --> 36:46.954
that other cats can't do

36:47.038 --> 36:49.957
just because their brain
is not wired to do that.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.044
<i> Eddy also loves to jump.</i>

36:54.295 --> 36:57.215
<i>So they're teaching her</i>
<i>one of their hardest tricks.</i>

36:58.633 --> 37:02.011
She's currently working on
a jump through the paper hoop.

37:06.515 --> 37:10.937
I would say, like,
it's the next more challenging trick

37:11.020 --> 37:14.398
that you can do
after, like, uh, socializing them,

37:14.482 --> 37:19.153
because you basically teach
a cat how to jump into a wall.

37:20.279 --> 37:21.113
Eddy.

37:21.197 --> 37:24.492
It takes time, time, time
and a lot of practice,

37:24.575 --> 37:26.410
a lot of, like, wasted paper.

37:27.787 --> 37:29.914
It's still kind of still in process.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.792
Eddy, leap.

37:42.843 --> 37:44.929
<i>It's gonna take some practice.</i>

37:49.058 --> 37:53.229
<i>But the Savitskys are learning</i>
<i>how to motivate Eddy.</i>

37:55.898 --> 37:56.732
Good boy!

37:56.816 --> 37:59.819
<i>Different cats</i>
<i>are motivated by different rewards.</i>

38:02.238 --> 38:06.242
<i>This might seem simple enough,</i>
<i>but many new cat owners get it wrong.</i>

38:06.325 --> 38:07.243
My new love.

38:08.035 --> 38:13.082
I think part of it is that they're using
the wrong items to motivate the cats.

38:15.501 --> 38:19.088
<i> Cats are more discerning</i>
<i>than many other pets.</i>

38:19.171 --> 38:21.507
<i>Food is not always the great motivator.</i>

38:23.592 --> 38:27.471
We found that the majority of cats
actually prefer social rewards.

38:28.180 --> 38:31.767
<i> Kristyn has done</i>
<i>extensive research on what cats want.</i>

38:33.102 --> 38:34.562
<i>She gives cats a choice</i>

38:34.645 --> 38:36.605
<i>between their favorite toy,</i>

38:36.689 --> 38:38.357
<i>their favorite smell,</i>

38:38.441 --> 38:39.525
<i>their favorite food,</i>

38:40.109 --> 38:41.485
<i>or their owner.</i>

38:52.038 --> 38:55.499
<i>And more than half the time,</i>
<i>they choose their people.</i>

38:56.959 --> 38:59.170
I think he loves you.

38:59.253 --> 39:01.881
<i>It seems the heart trumps the stomach.</i>

39:03.174 --> 39:06.552
<i>So is this proof that cats love us?</i>

39:06.635 --> 39:09.555
I get asked a lot
whether cats love us or not.

39:09.638 --> 39:14.352
Love is a really complex emotion,
and even in humans, you know,

39:14.852 --> 39:18.022
someone might tell you that they love you,
but they behave very differently.

39:20.858 --> 39:24.487
<i> To answer that question</i>
<i>and understand the true nature</i>

39:24.570 --> 39:26.197
<i>of the human-cat relationship,</i>

39:26.280 --> 39:28.824
<i>we need to go</i>
<i>all the way back to the beginning.</i>

39:34.330 --> 39:38.250
<i>For years, historians believed</i>
<i>our friendship began in Egypt</i>

39:38.334 --> 39:39.919
<i>around 4,000 years ago.</i>

39:43.047 --> 39:46.300
<i>But a recent breakthrough</i>
<i>changed everything.</i>

39:53.057 --> 39:54.767
Ten thousand years ago,

39:55.267 --> 39:58.729
so before the Neolithic,
there were no cats in Cyprus.

40:01.190 --> 40:04.527
<i> Cyprus is a small island</i>
<i>in the Mediterranean</i>

40:04.610 --> 40:06.737
<i>near the cradle of civilization</i>

40:06.821 --> 40:10.616
<i>where archaeologists</i>
<i>recently unearthed a huge discovery.</i>

40:12.284 --> 40:15.121
They found a Neolithic burial of a child.

40:15.204 --> 40:18.332
And in this burial,
there was also a cat skeleton.

40:19.917 --> 40:23.629
<i> Dr. Eva Maria used DNA</i>
<i>to date this find.</i>

40:24.755 --> 40:27.133
<i>And it would become</i>
<i>the earliest known evidence</i>

40:27.216 --> 40:29.385
<i>of a human-cat relationship…</i>

40:32.763 --> 40:36.934
<i>…proving we've been together</i>
<i>for at least 10,000 years.</i>

40:39.437 --> 40:41.939
This cat did not swim over the sea.

40:43.149 --> 40:48.237
It means that people took this cat
on their ships to Cyprus.

40:48.737 --> 40:52.700
So something happened
around this time in this area.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.703
<i>What happened was the farm.</i>

40:57.496 --> 41:00.624
<i>Humans began to grow crops</i>
<i>and store grains,</i>

41:00.708 --> 41:03.544
<i>and wildcats saw an opportunity.</i>

41:05.171 --> 41:08.549
These granaries
must have attracted rodents,

41:08.632 --> 41:11.177
which was a disaster
for the early farmers.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.095
And so the cats

41:14.388 --> 41:16.891
jumped on these rodents
and thrived on the rodents.

41:17.850 --> 41:21.187
And this was probably
the beginning of this relationship

41:21.270 --> 41:24.440
between the wildcats and humans.

41:25.441 --> 41:28.068
<i>And from here, the relationship grew.</i>

41:29.570 --> 41:31.322
Egyptians worship cats.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.700
You had millions of cats mummified,

41:34.783 --> 41:40.623
and from the Egyptian iconography,
statues, all kind of depictions of cats.

41:41.540 --> 41:46.545
And there you see chairs
of noble people, very often women,

41:47.379 --> 41:49.840
and a little cat under the chair.

41:51.342 --> 41:56.013
So this shows us
that the cat had entered the house.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.933
It was on the way to become a house cat.

42:00.142 --> 42:02.019
<i>Wherever we went, cats followed…</i>

42:04.230 --> 42:05.397
<i>often by boat.</i>

42:07.399 --> 42:10.027
Ships are probably

42:10.110 --> 42:14.114
the predominant means
of spreading of the cat.

42:15.074 --> 42:17.618
The rodents went on the ships,
and the cats followed.

42:17.701 --> 42:20.412
And so there was not
a single ship, probably,

42:20.496 --> 42:22.831
that went out of the port without cats.

42:23.332 --> 42:29.338
<i>So this is how </i>Felis catus
<i>made its way to every continent on Earth.</i>

42:33.384 --> 42:39.348
It was so important on ships
that until 1975 in the British Navy,

42:39.431 --> 42:42.726
it was still compulsory
to have a cat on the ship.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.396
<i> It wasn't just the British.</i>

42:50.651 --> 42:54.071
<i> Attention, Mr. Coast Guardsman.</i>
<i>Herman the cat is on the prowl.</i>

42:54.154 --> 42:57.992
<i>In Baltimore, Herman is fingerprinted,</i>
<i>or is it, uh, paw-printed,</i>

42:58.075 --> 43:00.494
<i>so he can get</i>
<i>an official Coast Guard pass.</i>

43:02.955 --> 43:04.373
<i> This is real.</i>

43:05.457 --> 43:09.336
<i>Herman the cat was actually</i>
<i>in the US Coast Guard.</i>

43:11.297 --> 43:15.509
<i>But history hasn't always been</i>
<i>this kind to felines.</i>

43:25.227 --> 43:27.813
<i>Stories of black cats and dark magic,</i>

43:28.397 --> 43:31.358
<i>witches and cauldrons</i>
<i>did not begin in Salem</i>

43:32.067 --> 43:33.652
<i>or even Transylvania</i>

43:34.570 --> 43:38.032
<i>but with a rogue pope named Gregory IX.</i>

43:39.825 --> 43:41.744
Cats in the Middle Ages

43:42.745 --> 43:44.663
were associated to witches.

43:45.331 --> 43:47.166
Witches were actually

43:48.125 --> 43:53.964
intelligent women,
wise women who knew a lot about nature.

43:54.590 --> 43:58.969
These wise women
knew that keeping the house clean

43:59.470 --> 44:01.013
would keep you healthy.

44:01.847 --> 44:04.016
So they cleaned the house with a broom,

44:04.099 --> 44:07.186
and they had cats to get rid of rodents.

44:07.269 --> 44:10.606
There came the time when the Church,

44:11.815 --> 44:13.192
dominated by males,

44:13.859 --> 44:15.653
considered them to be a danger.

44:15.736 --> 44:18.781
So the Church tried to get rid of them.

44:19.865 --> 44:22.076
<i>Demonized during this Papal Inquisition,</i>

44:22.159 --> 44:25.037
<i>Europe's cat population was decimated,</i>

44:26.789 --> 44:30.793
<i>which some believe</i>
<i>may have contributed to the Black Plague.</i>

44:34.713 --> 44:41.679
Black Death, theplague was transmitted
by…rodents, by fleas, actually.

44:42.763 --> 44:45.683
And the fleas were
in the fur of the rodents.

44:47.184 --> 44:50.270
<i> With fewer cats,</i>
<i>the plague was out of control.</i>

44:53.440 --> 44:55.984
<i>Thankfully, even during these dark times,</i>

44:56.068 --> 44:59.697
<i>some people continued to nurture</i>
<i>a bond with cats…</i>

45:10.666 --> 45:14.336
<i>…a relationship</i>
<i>that's still evolving to this day.</i>

45:19.133 --> 45:21.927
There's a history of cats in distilleries.

45:22.678 --> 45:24.972
It's quite a traditional thing
in Scotland.

45:25.472 --> 45:28.767
There was a very famous cat
over at a distillery in Perthshire

45:28.851 --> 45:32.229
called Towser, and he's probably
the most famous distillery cat ever.

45:32.312 --> 45:35.566
-Yeah, he or she is legendary.
-Yeah.

45:35.649 --> 45:38.026
I think he is
the most famous distillery cat.

45:44.658 --> 45:47.119
<i>Five years ago,</i>
<i>Helen and Drew Mckenzie</i>

45:47.202 --> 45:48.829
<i>adopted two working cats</i>

45:49.705 --> 45:51.915
<i>to carry on an age-old tradition.</i>

45:54.877 --> 45:57.504
The abbey was founded in 1191.

45:59.673 --> 46:03.051
We have William Wallace coming here
after his victory over the English

46:03.135 --> 46:04.720
at the Battle of Black Earnside.

46:08.056 --> 46:09.683
So it's got a huge history.

46:10.350 --> 46:12.936
I suppose we're continuing the tradition.

46:13.020 --> 46:15.898
You know, all the cats
that have been here over the years.

46:18.567 --> 46:21.320
<i>They named</i>
<i>the black male Friar John Claw…</i>

46:23.322 --> 46:24.907
<i>and the calico female Vespers,</i>

46:26.366 --> 46:28.827
<i>a nod to the medieval monks</i>
<i>that lived here.</i>

46:29.661 --> 46:34.666
<i>And just like those monks,</i>
<i>these cats begin their services at night.</i>

46:46.428 --> 46:49.681
The eyes of cats are very large
compared to the size of the skull.

46:51.558 --> 46:54.019
They also have something
called the tapetum lucidum,

46:54.102 --> 46:56.855
which is a layer of cells
at the back of the eye

46:56.939 --> 46:59.149
that reflects light back to the retina,

46:59.900 --> 47:03.570
so it allows them
to see very well in low-light conditions.

47:05.239 --> 47:08.242
<i> What they're looking for</i>
<i>poses a very real danger</i>

47:08.325 --> 47:09.952
<i>to the health of the distillery.</i>

47:11.662 --> 47:14.164
Mice are always present
in a distillery

47:14.248 --> 47:18.252
because of the huge amounts of barely,
and grain obviously attracts mice.

47:19.545 --> 47:22.005
Unfortunately,
without getting too technical,

47:22.089 --> 47:25.300
mice kind of wee
all the time, so…

47:25.384 --> 47:28.929
For want of a better expression.
Um, and that's not a good thing.

47:30.347 --> 47:33.767
<i> To find these vermin,</i>
<i>the cats need to get ultrasonic.</i>

47:35.978 --> 47:39.523
The ears of cats
can rotate about 180 degrees.

47:40.566 --> 47:42.693
And they can hear very high frequencies.

47:42.776 --> 47:47.906
This is because the prey that they seek
vocalizes in this auditory range.

47:49.741 --> 47:54.371
So this allows them to kind of localize
and kind of triangulate on prey.

48:08.552 --> 48:10.470
<i> The cats do their job well.</i>

48:13.932 --> 48:18.020
<i>But Helen and Drew were curious</i>
<i>what exactly they were up to.</i>

48:19.938 --> 48:23.483
<i>So Helen put on GPS trackers to find out.</i>

48:26.028 --> 48:28.697
<i>The GPS collars revealed that each night,</i>

48:28.780 --> 48:31.158
<i>Vespers travels more than a mile,</i>

48:31.867 --> 48:34.328
<i>but she never strays too far from home.</i>

48:35.579 --> 48:38.415
Vespers, who is officially
the chief mouser,

48:38.498 --> 48:41.084
is busy getting on with
the day job and night job.

48:42.002 --> 48:44.963
<i>And she's most active just before dawn,</i>

48:45.797 --> 48:47.257
<i>prime rodent time.</i>

48:48.175 --> 48:51.762
Cats are crepuscular animals, okay?

48:52.346 --> 48:55.015
Crespuc-- Crep--
Crepuscular animals

48:55.098 --> 49:00.270
means that they're active
early dawn and at dusk.

49:01.772 --> 49:04.691
<i>Which may explain why cats are so crazy</i>

49:04.775 --> 49:06.276
<i>in the wee hours of the night.</i>

49:08.028 --> 49:11.448
My cats tend to have
the zoomies after we go to bed.

49:14.326 --> 49:17.663
The zoomies, you know,
when cats have a sudden burst of energy.

49:18.705 --> 49:21.708
We call it "FRAP," F-R-A-P.

49:25.587 --> 49:28.674
You can see them, like,
make little chirping noises,

49:28.757 --> 49:31.969
and they get low to the ground,
and they jump from here to there.

49:33.261 --> 49:35.639
They're chasing each other,
they're vocalizing,

49:35.722 --> 49:38.684
just having a grand time
when the rest of us are sleeping.

49:40.727 --> 49:42.187
This is all instinctive behavior.

49:42.270 --> 49:45.065
It goes back to… to the circadian rhythm.

49:45.148 --> 49:49.277
This is an internal clock in our body
that we got from our ancestors.

49:50.320 --> 49:54.408
<i> Some cats have</i>
<i>another peculiar nighttime ritual.</i>

49:55.867 --> 49:59.246
Vespers, in particular,
she is a big present giver.

49:59.746 --> 50:04.459
I reckon Ves probably catches…
four or five things a day.

50:04.543 --> 50:08.547
<i>But why do cats</i>
<i>bring their owners gifts?</i>

50:09.047 --> 50:12.217
We know
that when a mother cat has kittens,

50:12.300 --> 50:15.721
that she will basically bring
the prey back for the kittens,

50:15.804 --> 50:18.932
so they can learn
what kinds of prey are suitable

50:19.016 --> 50:22.102
and kind of let them play with it, uh,

50:22.185 --> 50:26.815
and in kind of a morbid sense,
to get practice trying to get the prey.

50:28.608 --> 50:31.069
<i>Whatever the reason,</i>
<i>it's a compliment.</i>

50:31.695 --> 50:33.363
<i>It means you're family.</i>

50:34.322 --> 50:36.408
And there's few things less pleasant

50:36.491 --> 50:38.994
when you're walking
without slippers on in the morning.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.582
<i> While Vespers performs</i>
<i>the traditional duties,</i>

50:44.541 --> 50:47.878
<i>Friar John Claw has</i>
<i>a more modern approach.</i>

50:48.879 --> 50:50.422
He's very laid-back,

50:51.089 --> 50:53.967
you know, loves the public,
spends a huge amount of time

50:54.051 --> 50:57.220
in the actual visitor center itself
just being stroked.

50:58.096 --> 51:02.017
<i> FJC realized</i>
<i>his sister is all over the mice.</i>

51:02.893 --> 51:04.936
<i>His talents are better used elsewhere.</i>

51:06.521 --> 51:09.775
FJC's role, it could be said,
is more of an ambassador.

51:16.656 --> 51:17.908
He's front of house.

51:17.991 --> 51:21.286
-She's back of house.
-She's back of house, doing the hard work.

51:22.621 --> 51:24.998
<i> Vespers uses instinct.</i>

51:25.082 --> 51:27.918
<i>Friar John Claw uses Instagram.</i>

51:29.461 --> 51:32.839
<i>What started 10,000 years ago</i>
<i>as a working relationship</i>

51:33.965 --> 51:36.259
<i>has evolved into a global obsession.</i>

51:40.555 --> 51:43.391
The way that cats
have gone viral on the Internet is…

51:43.475 --> 51:46.394
I think really exceeds
anything that anyone would have expected.

51:46.478 --> 51:49.940
I believe the second most common reason
people go to the Internet

51:50.023 --> 51:51.358
is to watch cat videos.

51:52.651 --> 51:55.946
<i> Cats are</i>
<i>the number one family-friendly thing</i>

51:56.029 --> 51:57.030
<i>on the Internet…</i>

51:59.116 --> 52:01.618
…<i>with more than 25 billion views.</i>

52:01.701 --> 52:02.536
Oh-ho-ho!

52:03.870 --> 52:05.705
<i> A new study</i>
<i>found that cat videos</i>

52:05.789 --> 52:08.291
<i>actually boost positive emotions</i>

52:08.375 --> 52:10.127
<i>and decrease negative feelings.</i>

52:12.087 --> 52:15.507
<i>In other words,</i>
<i>they provide a big ol' shot of dopamine.</i>

52:17.884 --> 52:20.804
I think that the Internet
has kind of become a space

52:20.887 --> 52:24.474
where cat-lovers can all
kind of unite and just love

52:24.558 --> 52:26.393
cats and laugh at them

52:26.476 --> 52:29.521
and kind of bond over
the silly things that our cats do.

52:29.604 --> 52:31.690
It kind of gives us a space to do that.

52:34.025 --> 52:36.278
<i>Bad behavior makes for a fun video.</i>

52:37.821 --> 52:41.241
<i>But it's not always funny</i>
<i>when it's happening in your own home.</i>

52:43.451 --> 52:46.079
When we have unwanted behavior,

52:46.163 --> 52:49.040
keep in mind that,
you know, cats are being cats.

52:49.124 --> 52:51.459
They don't know you don't want them
on top of your counter.

52:53.170 --> 52:56.047
<i>Rule number one,</i>
<i>never punish a cat.</i>

52:57.757 --> 53:01.011
When your cat is doing
something you don't want,

53:01.094 --> 53:02.429
right, and you punish him,

53:03.054 --> 53:07.100
he sometimes doesn't understand
why you don't like it, right?

53:07.184 --> 53:09.519
It also makes you feel unpredictable.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.814
"All of a sudden,
you're yelling and screaming."

53:12.898 --> 53:14.649
"I don't understand what happened."

53:16.193 --> 53:18.028
<i> The key is positivity.</i>

53:22.657 --> 53:24.910
If your cat is doing
something you don't want,

53:24.993 --> 53:28.955
you wanna be able to distract the cat
and then tell him. Tell him what you want.

53:29.039 --> 53:31.875
"Hey, let's do this.
Come over and touch my hand."

53:31.958 --> 53:35.837
"Go to your bed.
What a smart kitty, yay!"

53:35.921 --> 53:39.007
And your cat goes,
"Yeah, I'm the best cat ever!"

53:41.968 --> 53:45.889
<i> For really bad habits,</i>
<i>classical conditioning is not enough.</i>

53:47.599 --> 53:53.104
Counterconditioning is the process
of changing an emotional response.

53:54.314 --> 53:57.359
<i>This is when you pull out the good stuff,</i>

53:57.442 --> 54:00.111
<i>their favorite, most irresistible treat.</i>

54:00.779 --> 54:04.199
Offering something
so highly valuable or rewarding

54:04.282 --> 54:08.411
that the animal goes,
"Oh! That wasn't so bad. I like this."

54:09.746 --> 54:11.706
I always give the example to my clients

54:11.790 --> 54:14.501
of, what if every time
you walked out of the house,

54:14.584 --> 54:17.921
you had a snarky neighbor,
and he always said something mean to you?

54:18.421 --> 54:20.966
So you try to avoid going out
when he's out there.

54:22.259 --> 54:25.553
But what if every time
you went out there, I gave you $1,000?

54:25.637 --> 54:26.763
Huh?

54:27.681 --> 54:31.059
Then you're like, "That's not so bad.
I don't mind seeing that guy."

54:31.977 --> 54:34.312
What if you saw him four times a day,
and you got $4,000?

54:34.396 --> 54:36.898
You're gonna be like, "Yeah! Bring it on!"

54:36.982 --> 54:39.818
"Where is he?" You're gonna wanna see
that guy all the time, right?

54:41.111 --> 54:43.238
So that's what counterconditioning is.

54:43.321 --> 54:45.240
You can change a situation

54:45.323 --> 54:50.120
from being negative,
to more neutral, to then positive.

54:52.747 --> 54:56.001
<i> Like any relationship,</i>
<i>it can take patience,</i>

54:56.626 --> 54:58.253
<i>but it's worth it.</i>

54:59.337 --> 55:02.799
You get the sense sometimes
that they might not need you,

55:03.967 --> 55:05.552
but they still want you.

55:05.635 --> 55:10.598
And that's this very unique and mystical
and deep-seated relationship.

55:11.182 --> 55:13.184
<i>A cat's true motivation</i>

55:13.268 --> 55:16.521
<i>isn't as easy to interpret</i>
<i>as some other pets'.</i>

55:17.939 --> 55:21.234
Dogs see
their owners as gods.

55:22.610 --> 55:24.487
But cats think of <i>themselves </i>as gods.

55:26.031 --> 55:27.866
Cats don't want to do
what they don't like.

55:28.533 --> 55:30.577
They want to sleep
when they want to sleep,

55:30.660 --> 55:33.121
eat when they want to eat,
play when they want to play.

55:36.750 --> 55:40.045
<i> Don't mistake</i>
<i>independence for indifference.</i>

55:40.754 --> 55:44.090
If you kind of have that perception
that cats are aloof,

55:44.174 --> 55:46.259
they don't care about social interaction,

55:46.343 --> 55:48.428
so you don't go out of your way
to interact with them,

55:49.012 --> 55:52.307
you're basically shaping
the cat to then also be aloof

55:52.390 --> 55:54.559
because that was what
you expected of them.

55:55.602 --> 55:57.812
In our work, we found that

55:57.896 --> 56:01.441
how the person behaves
really does impact the cat's behavior.

56:02.817 --> 56:05.904
<i>Kristyn's research is proving</i>
<i>how a cat treats you</i>

56:06.488 --> 56:09.449
<i>directly reflects how you treat them.</i>

56:10.992 --> 56:15.580
<i>One step further, her work is showing</i>
<i>they might even pick up on how we feel.</i>

56:18.166 --> 56:21.294
So this is known as
the social-referencing test.

56:21.378 --> 56:24.422
And the whole idea is
that this fan with streamers

56:24.506 --> 56:26.466
is totally novel to the cat.

56:26.549 --> 56:30.053
So he doesn't know if it's something scary
or if it's something fun.

56:30.553 --> 56:34.140
So the whole idea is that the person
can put off emotional cues

56:34.224 --> 56:36.226
and see how the cat responds.

56:36.976 --> 56:38.603
Carl, that's scary!

56:39.646 --> 56:41.689
Carl, that's scary, isn't it?

56:42.482 --> 56:43.983
Oh no!

56:44.067 --> 56:46.820
Oh no! Oh my gosh!

56:47.695 --> 56:48.780
Look at that!

56:48.863 --> 56:51.241
<i>When Kristyn acts scared of the fan,</i>

56:51.324 --> 56:52.742
<i>Carl tries to hide.</i>

56:55.703 --> 56:57.414
Is the fan scary?

56:58.164 --> 57:00.750
<i>A quick reset</i>
<i>and an attitude adjustment,</i>

57:00.834 --> 57:02.419
<i>and it's time for round two.</i>

57:06.464 --> 57:08.550
So if I'm happy towards the fan,

57:08.633 --> 57:11.719
we should see if the cat
can pick up on my emotions.

57:16.850 --> 57:19.811
Look. Look at what a nice fan.

57:21.354 --> 57:23.231
Look at what a good fan.

57:23.314 --> 57:27.026
<i> When she speaks nicely</i>
<i>to the fan and is not scared,</i>

57:27.110 --> 57:28.903
<i>Carl seems more confident.</i>

57:29.654 --> 57:31.656
Look at those streamers.

57:33.116 --> 57:34.200
Look.

57:35.076 --> 57:37.495
<i> The fan is no longer a threat.</i>

57:38.246 --> 57:39.330
No more fear!

57:43.126 --> 57:44.461
<i> It's not just Carl.</i>

57:45.962 --> 57:50.258
<i>Seventy-nine percent of cats</i>
<i>look to their owners for emotional advice.</i>

57:51.926 --> 57:54.387
<i>For scientists, it's another breakthrough.</i>

57:57.307 --> 58:01.019
<i>It seems cats</i>
<i>are experts at feeling our feelings…</i>

58:03.730 --> 58:05.356
<i>good and bad.</i>

58:06.858 --> 58:10.320
If you even have a bad mood
and you go into training cats,

58:10.403 --> 58:11.738
just walk away.

58:11.821 --> 58:13.823
Do not go… Do not go there.

58:13.907 --> 58:17.535
They feel everything,
and they make it worse.

58:18.077 --> 58:19.245
Asia, come here.

58:22.707 --> 58:26.669
<i> Cats have learned to be empaths</i>
<i>to adapt and survive.</i>

58:28.254 --> 58:30.965
There is an evolutionary advantage

58:31.049 --> 58:34.761
to being able to look at social partners
in your environment

58:34.844 --> 58:36.596
and gather information.

58:36.679 --> 58:40.183
So if you're unable to read
anybody's response,

58:40.266 --> 58:43.061
then you have really cut yourself off

58:43.144 --> 58:46.981
from a whole lot of information
about how to react

58:47.065 --> 58:49.108
to something potentially dangerous.

58:50.318 --> 58:53.655
<i> This revelation</i>
<i>that cats pick up on our feelings</i>

58:53.738 --> 58:57.242
<i>then took a much bigger turn</i>
<i>than anyone ever expected.</i>

59:01.538 --> 59:04.916
<i>Back in Japan,</i>
<i>Dr. Saho Takagi noticed something.</i>

59:07.669 --> 59:11.589
I realized
that we can observe different behaviors

59:11.673 --> 59:15.343
in cats in the US and the ones in Japan.

59:17.971 --> 59:22.308
In Japan, cats have a hard time
with unfamiliar places.

59:23.851 --> 59:25.645
However, cats I saw in the US…

59:28.648 --> 59:34.237
…act normal even in unfamiliar places.

59:34.320 --> 59:41.244
So Japanese and American cats
might have different personalities.

59:42.245 --> 59:45.498
<i> Kristyn and Saho</i>
<i>decided to run the same experiments</i>

59:45.582 --> 59:47.584
<i>in the US and in Japan.</i>

59:49.460 --> 59:52.505
<i>And they're finding</i>
<i>the cats are different.</i>

59:56.050 --> 59:59.387
We're seeing social differences
between cats in Japan and the US.

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:07.312
I realized
that our cultural differences affect cats.

1:00:09.689 --> 1:00:12.775
<i>Is human culture changing cat culture?</i>

1:00:14.193 --> 1:00:17.614
Japan is an island nation.

1:00:18.823 --> 1:00:23.119
Most cat owners keep
their cats completely indoors.

1:00:23.202 --> 1:00:27.123
People in Japan
rarely have a party at home.

1:00:27.957 --> 1:00:30.835
Therefore, for cats in Japan,
the frequency of meeting strangers

1:00:30.918 --> 1:00:33.838
is much less than for cats in the US.

1:00:34.756 --> 1:00:39.385
These might be factors contributing
to the differences between cats in Japan

1:00:39.469 --> 1:00:41.471
and cats in the US.

1:00:43.556 --> 1:00:46.601
<i> Their research</i>
<i>suggests these cultural differences</i>

1:00:46.684 --> 1:00:50.355
<i>might actually be handed down</i>
<i>from generation to generation.</i>

1:00:53.941 --> 1:00:58.404
<i>And in one culture, it's bringing</i>
<i>our species even closer together.</i>

1:01:11.876 --> 1:01:14.504
<i>Even before Istanbul was Constantinople,</i>

1:01:14.587 --> 1:01:17.090
<i>it was the city of cats.</i>

1:01:18.966 --> 1:01:23.846
<i>These streets are home</i>
<i>to more than 100,000 community cats</i>

1:01:23.930 --> 1:01:26.724
<i>perfectly suited to an urban lifestyle.</i>

1:01:31.771 --> 1:01:35.358
Nowadays, when you go to Istanbul,
you find these cats around.

1:01:36.943 --> 1:01:40.530
They are cats
that belong to the neighborhood.

1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:43.658
They are not owned by a specific person.

1:01:44.450 --> 1:01:48.204
People provide the infrastructure for cats

1:01:48.287 --> 1:01:50.248
so that they can survive,

1:01:50.331 --> 1:01:54.252
but they are not… They do not belong
to somebody specifically.

1:01:56.379 --> 1:02:02.093
<i> In 2021, Istanbul introduced</i>
<i>new laws protecting these cats,</i>

1:02:02.176 --> 1:02:05.221
<i>some of the most progressive legislation</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

1:02:07.348 --> 1:02:11.644
<i>Treating a cat as an equal</i>
<i>and seeing things from their point of view</i>

1:02:11.728 --> 1:02:14.564
<i>is the best way</i>
<i>to strengthen the relationship.</i>

1:02:15.857 --> 1:02:16.691
Hi.

1:02:25.283 --> 1:02:27.452
The whole reason
my specialty exists

1:02:27.535 --> 1:02:30.955
is because people recognize
they have this deep bond with this animal,

1:02:31.038 --> 1:02:32.290
this deep love.

1:02:34.292 --> 1:02:36.002
We do it for the love of animals.

1:02:36.627 --> 1:02:39.213
We do it because we recognize
the human-animal bond.

1:02:40.882 --> 1:02:43.718
And I don't know why I'm crying.
Stop making me cry.

1:02:43.801 --> 1:02:47.805
Um… yeah, this is why we do it,
because we love animals.

1:02:49.932 --> 1:02:52.810
<i> It's clear we love cats.</i>

1:02:53.853 --> 1:02:56.773
<i>Which leads us</i>
<i>to the biggest cat question of all.</i>

1:02:59.233 --> 1:03:01.694
Do I think cats love us?

1:03:02.737 --> 1:03:05.656
It's really hard to measure
emotions in cats,

1:03:05.740 --> 1:03:07.909
but I do feel like,
based on their behavior,

1:03:07.992 --> 1:03:09.827
based on their relationship,

1:03:09.911 --> 1:03:15.374
that cats can form such a deep bond
with someone that it is akin to love.

1:03:19.962 --> 1:03:22.715
Cats love their owners very much.

1:03:22.799 --> 1:03:28.679
I believe that my cats definitely love me.

1:03:30.389 --> 1:03:32.850
It's pretty clear
that cats provide

1:03:33.476 --> 1:03:37.313
emotional support,
a feeling of wellness, happiness.

1:03:37.939 --> 1:03:42.860
This notion that you can come home
and have unconditional love from your cat

1:03:42.944 --> 1:03:44.821
is something that's vital.

1:03:50.576 --> 1:03:52.495
<i>With all the devotion of her family,</i>

1:03:52.578 --> 1:03:56.415
<i>Eddy is perfectly positioned</i>
<i>to become the next big superstar.</i>

1:03:59.585 --> 1:04:03.089
<i> All she needs to do</i>
<i>is complete the paper hoop.</i>

1:04:08.845 --> 1:04:12.598
<i>We're only beginning</i>
<i>to realize the potential of cats.</i>

1:04:13.224 --> 1:04:17.812
There is still so much
we don't know about cats.

1:04:17.895 --> 1:04:21.107
The future will bring
more discoveries bit by bit.

1:04:23.150 --> 1:04:24.694
<i> The more we learn,</i>

1:04:24.777 --> 1:04:28.239
<i>the more we realize</i>
<i>just how deep our connection is.</i>

1:04:30.867 --> 1:04:33.786
They feel the love
that you giving to them.

1:04:33.870 --> 1:04:37.290
And they are kind of, like, feeding on it.

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.710
Love is going both ways.

1:04:42.837 --> 1:04:46.340
<i> If we can learn</i>
<i>how to bring out the best in our felines,</i>

1:04:46.424 --> 1:04:48.801
<i>they will bring out the best in us.</i>

1:04:50.803 --> 1:04:53.598
I can't imagine my life without cats.

1:04:54.265 --> 1:04:57.393
They are my animals. I feel them.

1:04:57.476 --> 1:05:00.980
And I hope they love me
as much as I love them.

1:05:02.398 --> 1:05:04.525
<i>When everything comes together,</i>

1:05:04.609 --> 1:05:07.153
<i>the results can be magical.</i>
