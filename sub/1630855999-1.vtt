14:37.411 --> 14:40.582
You texted me today
to meet you at school.

14:40.715 --> 14:42.316
[Sarah] <i>You texted me!</i>

14:42.684 --> 14:44.351
Sarah, I didn't meet you
until this afternoon.

14:44.485 --> 14:46.120
How would I have your number?

14:46.387 --> 14:47.856
[Sarah] <i>I should hang up.</i>

14:47.988 --> 14:49.356
No, no, no, Sarah,
I need your help.

14:49.490 --> 14:51.291
Okay, you were the last person

14:51.425 --> 14:53.160
to talk to Ruby last night.

14:53.595 --> 14:56.765
[sobs] <i>Not like in person.</i>
<i>We Snapchatted.</i>

14:57.565 --> 15:00.467
-What exactly did she say?
- <i>I told you already.</i>

15:00.968 --> 15:02.469
[Tom]
Tell me again.

15:02.637 --> 15:04.104
[Sarah] <i>She said she was</i>
<i>looking for her father,</i>

15:04.238 --> 15:05.807
<i>but he wasn't answering.</i>

15:06.140 --> 15:09.143
Yeah I was out late.
I was, it was really late,

15:09.276 --> 15:11.211
and I didn't hear her message
until this morning.

15:11.546 --> 15:13.748
[Sarah] <i>Could've meant her other</i>
<i>father. She just said father!</i>

15:13.882 --> 15:17.117
<i>I don't know which one.</i>
<i>Then she sent me the picture.</i>

15:17.418 --> 15:19.086
<i>I took a screenshot.</i>

15:19.219 --> 15:20.954
Okay, what happened
to the original?

15:21.121 --> 15:23.725
-[Sarah] <i>It-it-it disappeared.</i>
-What?

15:23.957 --> 15:26.026
[Sarah] <i>You know... Snapchat?</i>

15:27.060 --> 15:29.129
Yes. Sarah,
have you told your mum

15:29.263 --> 15:31.633
or the police
about the photograph, about--

15:31.766 --> 15:34.301
[Sarah] <i>God no! Ruby made me</i>
<i>swear never to tell anyone!</i>

15:34.869 --> 15:37.505
<i>And I deleted the picture</i>
<i>like you said.</i>

15:39.006 --> 15:42.309
Sarah, there's a reason
that you confided in me today.

15:42.443 --> 15:45.145
Why you showed me the photo
and no one else.

15:45.446 --> 15:47.381
[Sarah] <i>Because, like,</i>
<i>you're her dad.</i>

15:47.515 --> 15:49.784
That's right. I'm her dad.
I'm her dad, Sarah.

15:49.918 --> 15:51.151
Now I need your help.

15:51.285 --> 15:54.254
Is there anyone or anywhere

15:54.388 --> 15:56.390
you can think of
that she might be?

15:56.624 --> 15:58.325
[Sarah] <i>I don't want him</i>
<i>to get in trouble.</i>

15:58.459 --> 15:59.894
<i>No one's getting in trouble,</i>
<i>Sarah.</i>

16:00.127 --> 16:02.029
<i>She could be with Dario.</i>

16:02.664 --> 16:03.964
Who the fuck is Dario?

16:04.231 --> 16:06.568
-[Sarah] <i>Her boyfriend.</i>
-Boyfriend? She's 12.

16:06.734 --> 16:09.403
-[Sarah] <i>He's older.</i>
-Jesus fucking Christ.

16:09.537 --> 16:11.573
[Sarah] <i>He's in grade seven!</i>

16:13.641 --> 16:15.375
Okay, give me Dario's number.

16:15.677 --> 16:17.712
[Sarah] <i>I... I don't know</i>
<i>if I should.</i>

16:17.879 --> 16:20.047
<i>I'm supposed to</i>
<i>contact the police if...</i>

16:20.214 --> 16:21.850
Give me Dario's number, Sarah.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.251
And then you can call the police
and you can tell them we talked.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.387
All I care about is Ruby
and finding her.

16:29.990 --> 16:32.192
I'm worried about her, Sarah.

16:33.227 --> 16:34.929
Ruby's impulsive, you know.

16:35.395 --> 16:38.900
Like... Like that time, she-she
spray-painted the teacher's car

16:39.399 --> 16:40.668
[Sarah] <i>What?</i>

16:41.068 --> 16:43.605
When he told her she should
smile more. Remember?

16:44.338 --> 16:46.473
[Sarah] <i>That might have been</i>
<i>her old school.</i>

16:47.509 --> 16:49.309
I'm worried she's going
to do something to herself.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.345
That she, that she,
might hurt herself.

16:53.046 --> 16:56.316
[Sarah] <i>Okay.</i>
<i>I texted you Dario's number.</i>

16:57.284 --> 16:58.887
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you, Sarah.

16:59.052 --> 17:01.154

<i>she wouldn't do that.</i>

36:52.379 --> 36:54.882
<i>What shit? He was a fucking</i>
<i>insurance salesman, Tom.</i>

36:55.016 --> 36:57.685
<i>He was dull as hell. His office</i>
<i>was above our garage.</i>

36:57.819 --> 37:00.121
You must have seen something,
Terri. Are you fucking blind?

37:00.253 --> 37:02.255
<i>Oh, I must be, I married you,</i>
<i>didn't I?</i>

37:02.990 --> 37:05.560
-Terri, I just need some time.
<i>-Just bring her back, Tom.</i>

37:05.693 --> 37:07.327
<i>I'll explain everything</i>
<i>to the cops.</i>

37:07.461 --> 37:08.896
No don't!
Do not talk to the cops.

37:09.030 --> 37:10.297
<i>They already know</i>
<i>you have her, Tom.</i>

37:10.430 --> 37:11.899

37:20.007 --> 37:22.210
-Terri.
<i>-Just bring her back to me.</i>

I'd do anything

37:23.578 --> 37:24.979

37:31.384 --> 37:33.087
Yeah, I killed the bastard.

37:33.221 --> 37:35.322
I killed him for her. And
I'd kill him again if I could.

And so would you.

37:41.996 --> 37:43.931
You need to trust me.
I just need time.

You can't say anything
to anyone, okay?

37:46.500 --> 37:47.935
Especially the cops.

37:48.569 --> 37:51.973
<i>Okay. Okay. But I need you</i>

37:54.307 --> 37:56.276

46:31.091 --> 46:32.893

46:33.027 --> 46:35.697

46:38.332 --> 46:40.934
<i>actions and consequences.</i>

46:41.068 --> 46:42.403
<i>It's really very simple.</i>

46:42.537 --> 46:44.805
I don't want to talk about me
anymore.

46:46.775 --> 46:48.942
<i>Let's talk about Ruby.</i>

46:53.013 --> 46:55.382
[intense music]

47:19.873 --> 47:21.509
<i>Easy, Tom.</i>

47:21.643 --> 47:24.546
<i>You don't have any points</i>
<i>left on your license.</i>

47:33.354 --> 47:36.957
<i>It's best to accept</i>
<i>the inevitable, Tom.</i>

47:37.091 --> 47:39.259
<i>It's not a matter</i>
<i>of my patience.</i>

47:39.393 --> 47:43.364
<i>I'm enjoying our discussion</i>
<i>and getting to know you.</i>

47:43.964 --> 47:46.735
<i>It's just that</i>
<i>we have so little time.</i>

47:46.867 --> 47:48.636
<i>And this is, if you recall...</i>

47:48.770 --> 47:50.337
A matter of life and death.

47:50.471 --> 47:53.874
<i>Yes. I think we should</i>
<i>get to the point, Tom.</i>

47:54.007 --> 47:55.376
Please.

47:55.510 --> 47:58.278
<i>There's a reason</i>
<i>I was called in.</i>

47:58.780 --> 48:00.849
<i>There's always a reason.</i>

48:01.348 --> 48:03.283
I just want my daughter back.

48:03.417 --> 48:07.187
<i>Once you've compensated</i>
<i>for the loss, it's only fair.</i>

48:07.722 --> 48:10.190
<i>Someone has to pay</i>
<i>for Shane Bader.</i>

48:10.324 --> 48:11.793
He got what he deserved.

48:11.925 --> 48:14.562
<i>But you interrupted</i>
<i>a negotiation, Tom.</i>

48:14.696 --> 48:17.732
<i>He and I were in the middle</i>
<i>of a pleasant conversation.</i>

48:17.866 --> 48:20.501
<i>Much like the one</i>
<i>you and I are having,</i>

48:20.635 --> 48:22.871
<i>at this very moment.</i>

48:23.003 --> 48:25.472
<i>He, too, was in a life or death</i>
<i>situation,</i>

48:25.607 --> 48:28.942
<i>the nature of which</i>
<i>I'm not at liberty to reveal.</i>

48:29.476 --> 48:33.914
<i>Trust me. These mistakes</i>
<i>happen all the time, Tom.</i>

48:34.047 --> 48:35.382
<i>You're only human.</i>

48:36.316 --> 48:40.220
<i>But the fact remains, Mr. Bader</i>
<i>wasn't yours to judge.</i>

48:40.354 --> 48:41.856
You don't know what he did.

48:41.989 --> 48:44.324
<i>You'd be surprised what I know.</i>

48:44.458 --> 48:46.694
Any father would have done
the same.

48:48.696 --> 48:50.164
She's my daughter.

48:52.834 --> 48:54.234
I'm sorry.

48:54.736 --> 48:56.604
<i>Sorry for what, Tom?</i>

48:57.271 --> 48:58.706
<i>Your temper?</i>

48:59.607 --> 49:00.842
Can you blame me?

49:00.974 --> 49:02.911
<i>You are who you are, Tom.</i>

49:03.043 --> 49:07.147
<i>The apportion of blame</i>
<i>is relevant only to actions.</i>

49:07.649 --> 49:09.684
<i>But looking back</i>
<i>over your history</i>

49:09.818 --> 49:13.487
<i>and the events leading</i>
<i>to our discussion today,</i>

49:13.621 --> 49:17.224
<i>I'm afraid your temper</i>
<i>must be viewed as causation.</i>

49:17.357 --> 49:20.695
My temper wasn't the problem.
It was the drink that did me in.

49:21.962 --> 49:23.665
But I've been sober for years.

49:23.798 --> 49:28.368
<i>Eight years, seven months,</i>
<i>13 days to be exact.</i>

49:29.938 --> 49:33.508
This is the day my wife left me,
and took away my little girl.

49:34.676 --> 49:37.512
<i>She left you because of your</i>
<i>drinking.</i>

49:38.045 --> 49:39.781
When I drank I got mean.

49:40.682 --> 49:45.052
<i>And your sobriety hasn't really</i>
<i>resolved your anger issues?</i>

49:45.587 --> 49:47.488
<i>-Has it?</i>
-Not really.

49:48.455 --> 49:51.091
<i>-You're still angry?</i>
-Of course I'm fucking angry.

49:51.726 --> 49:54.328
I lost my only daughter,
I've lost my kid!

49:54.461 --> 49:56.296
<i>And you blame Shane Bader.</i>

49:56.430 --> 49:58.098
Well, he kept her from me,
didn't he?

49:58.232 --> 50:01.201
<i>His actions fall well</i>
<i>within his rights, Tom.</i>

50:01.335 --> 50:04.137
<i>He was after all her legal</i>
<i>custodian.</i>

50:04.271 --> 50:05.773
Not anymore!

50:08.242 --> 50:10.444
I saved her from that sick fuck.

50:10.578 --> 50:13.581
<i>Have you, Tom,</i>
<i>saved your daughter?</i>

50:13.715 --> 50:16.416
Yeah, mate, I did. I saved her
from the unspeakable.

50:16.551 --> 50:19.119
<i>About that photograph, Tom.</i>

50:19.654 --> 50:23.825
<i>No doubt you've considered</i>
<i>the power of that single image.</i>

50:24.592 --> 50:27.929
<i>The havoc it could wreak</i>
<i>on your daughter's innocence.</i>

50:28.763 --> 50:32.165
<i>What if there is</i>
<i>more than one image, Tom?</i>

50:33.433 --> 50:37.070
<i>What if Mr. Bader kept videos?</i>

50:41.910 --> 50:44.278
<i>Anything is possible.</i>

50:49.116 --> 50:51.819
<i>You need to be certain, Tom.</i>

50:58.793 --> 51:00.662
Tell me what to do.

51:04.164 --> 51:08.101
<i>Are you familiar</i>
<i>with Shane Bader's office?</i>

51:10.270 --> 51:12.339
It's above his garage.

51:12.472 --> 51:14.642
<i>You need to burn it, Tom.</i>

51:14.776 --> 51:17.879
-Burn down his office?
<i>-The entire garage.</i>

51:18.012 --> 51:20.247
<i>You need to burn it</i>
<i>to the ground.</i>

51:20.380 --> 51:22.050
Like now? It's impossible.

51:22.182 --> 51:25.787
<i>I'll need proof, of course.</i>
<i>A video text is fine.</i>

51:25.920 --> 51:27.722
I can't go back there.
They're waiting for me.

51:27.855 --> 51:30.892
<i>It's the only way to save</i>
<i>your daughter, Tom.</i>

51:31.025 --> 51:32.860
<i>There are still 37 minutes.</i>

51:32.994 --> 51:35.495
