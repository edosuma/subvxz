00:01.516 --> 00:04.516
<b>2x08 - Nemesis Prime</b>

00:08.617 --> 00:10.485
At ease, soldier.

00:12.000 --> 00:18.074

00:45.088 --> 00:46.988
Go around, you jerk.

00:57.868 --> 00:59.467
That's no road rage.

00:59.536 --> 01:04.539
Someone's trying to bump me off.

01:04.608 --> 01:06.474
Prime?

01:11.521 --> 01:14.834
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

02:08.425 --> 02:12.127
Prime, have you flipped your
metal wig?

02:21.806 --> 02:23.305
- Yes!
- Go! Go! Go!

02:23.374 --> 02:26.141
- Metal to the pedal, Miko.
- Go, Jack, go!

02:26.210 --> 02:29.111
No way!
Raf's scorching us.

02:30.614 --> 02:34.350
<i>Prime?
Do you read me?</i>

02:34.418 --> 02:37.519
I'm sorry, Agent Fowler.
Optimus isn't here at the moment.

02:37.588 --> 02:39.988
<i>Then I'll take that as
a confirmation that he's</i>

02:40.057 --> 02:43.525
<i>presently trying to run me off the road!</i>

02:43.594 --> 02:46.695
Agent Fowler,
that hardly seems likely.

02:46.764 --> 02:49.832
<i>Tell that to my burning treads!</i>

03:27.938 --> 03:32.341
Come on.
Come on.

03:39.950 --> 03:44.686
Prime, no!

04:06.844 --> 04:11.246
- Looks like Optimus.
- Primes don't run.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.332
You all right in there?

04:31.068 --> 04:32.468
At ease, soldier.

04:58.228 --> 05:02.464
Yes, that's it.
Follow the light.

05:04.034 --> 05:06.001
Wait. What?

05:08.005 --> 05:11.807
Not the best choice of words, Ratchet.

05:12.276 --> 05:14.009
Arcee, are you all right?

05:14.078 --> 05:18.447
Sure. Except for being
blindsided by Optimus.

05:18.516 --> 05:20.349
Didn't I tell you?

05:20.417 --> 05:23.752
- Impossible.
- I'm only reporting what I saw.

05:23.821 --> 05:26.722
Why would Optimus try
to knock off Agent Fowler?

05:26.790 --> 05:29.958
Maybe Optimus believes he's
a Decepticon all over again.

05:30.027 --> 05:33.929
Or he's been faking being
a good guy all this time.

05:33.998 --> 05:39.067
If Prime has gone off the rails
for any reason, we have a serious problem.

05:39.136 --> 05:42.271
This is absurd.

05:42.339 --> 05:45.140
A quick check for Optimus'
signal will reveal that he's

05:45.209 --> 05:48.076
nowhere near the location of
tonight's incident.

05:49.113 --> 05:54.850
In fact...
he's just returning now.

06:20.443 --> 06:22.377
Is something wrong?

06:22.446 --> 06:26.748
We were just...
wondering where you've been.

06:26.817 --> 06:29.451
We haven't been able to reach you.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.889
I have been outside of our
communication range...

06:41.465 --> 06:44.800
Come on. It's our guy.
Can't you tell?

06:50.440 --> 06:53.275
We're... sorry.

06:53.344 --> 06:54.876
Don't blame them, Prime.

06:54.945 --> 06:58.447
I was attacked earlier tonight
out on the open highway by a big rig --

06:58.515 --> 07:02.451
<i>one that bore a striking
resemblance to you.</i>

07:15.798 --> 07:17.432
Halt!

07:51.402 --> 07:53.969
<i>This is a restricted area.</i>

07:54.038 --> 07:57.739
<i>Exit the vehicle, or we will open fire.</i>

08:22.932 --> 08:30.672
I am Optimus Prime, leader of the autobots,
and I bring you this message.

08:38.749 --> 08:40.750
Fowler.

08:42.048 --> 08:42.484
What?!

08:42.553 --> 08:45.054
That's not possible.
I can tell you sure as there are

08:45.122 --> 08:50.693
50 stars on my star-spangled
shorts it isn't him.

08:50.761 --> 08:54.930
Alden military base is under attack...
by Optimus Prime.

08:54.999 --> 09:01.070
- The truck?
- The 'Bot.

09:01.138 --> 09:02.604
Fire! Fire!

09:34.638 --> 09:36.972
There.
They brought reinforcements.

09:37.041 --> 09:41.176
Resume fire!

09:41.245 --> 09:45.247
Autobots, return to base.

09:45.316 --> 09:48.917
We must not inflict human casualties.

10:08.004 --> 10:13.142
No, General Bryce.
Optimus Prime did not attack our boys.

10:13.210 --> 10:17.112
Because I was with Prime
when I received the alert.

10:17.181 --> 10:19.848
Yes, sir.
The autobots were at your base,

10:19.917 --> 10:25.487
but only in response to the initial attack.
But, sir, I --

10:25.556 --> 10:27.923
Yes, sir.
I understand.

10:27.992 --> 10:29.458
So, what's the damage?

10:30.361 --> 10:32.194
All military personnel are under

10:32.263 --> 10:35.898
strict orders to destroy any and
all 'Bots on sight.

10:35.966 --> 10:37.266
Are you kidding?!

10:37.334 --> 10:40.536
- But th-they're innocent.
- Optimus was framed!

10:40.604 --> 10:45.174
Though unfortunate, the
military order changes nothing.

10:45.242 --> 10:49.711
Our imposter clearly poses a grave
threat to humanity.

10:49.780 --> 10:52.748
A 30-foot-tall
transforming imposter.

10:52.817 --> 10:55.050
They actually did it.

10:55.119 --> 10:58.687
Those butchers managed
to crack the code.

10:58.756 --> 11:01.223
M.E.C.H.

11:28.651 --> 11:31.854
Sir, any parallax or latency issues?

11:31.922 --> 11:35.057
The telepresence interface
performed flawlessly.

11:35.125 --> 11:38.026
In vehicular and robot mode.

11:38.095 --> 11:41.964
M.E.C.H. abducted Breakdown...
and by all indications,

11:42.032 --> 11:46.001
deconstructed him from cranial
chamber to heel strut.

11:46.070 --> 11:47.336
I was there.

11:47.404 --> 11:53.175
And we know that, more recently,
they obtained Starscream's T-cog.

11:53.244 --> 11:56.445
Which they evidently
installed in a knockoff of you.

11:56.513 --> 12:00.215
Which, in turn, scanned an
appropriate vehicle form.

12:00.284 --> 12:05.687
- Fill the tank with Energon...
- ...and say hello to Nemesis Prime.

12:05.756 --> 12:08.824
So, where do we start?
M.E.C.H.'s base could be anywhere.

12:08.893 --> 12:10.259
Not necessarily.

12:10.327 --> 12:13.795
While M.E.C.H. may have learned much
of our biology...

12:13.864 --> 12:17.666
They haven't necessarily
absorbed our technology.

12:17.735 --> 12:22.271
Without access to a ground
bridge, Nemesis Prime would rely

12:22.339 --> 12:25.974
solely on its vehicle mode
for transportation.

12:26.043 --> 12:30.312
Chances are the M.E.C.H. base is
within driving distance of both incidents.

12:30.381 --> 12:31.647
What are we waiting for?

12:31.715 --> 12:34.683
Let's get out there and mash
M.E.C.H's little science project.

12:34.752 --> 12:39.187
Agent Fowler, I do not think
it advisable to put yourself

12:39.256 --> 12:41.823
in harm's way of M.E.C.H's
robot again.

12:41.892 --> 12:44.559
Well, I'm not sure it's
advisable for 'Bots to be

12:44.628 --> 12:48.096
running recon with the military
out there gunning for you.

12:48.165 --> 12:53.702
We will maintain vehicular
cover until absolutely necessary.

12:59.876 --> 13:01.977
Nothing but tumbleweeds.

13:05.482 --> 13:08.216
Just a whole lot of empty.

13:19.963 --> 13:23.899
<i>Bumblebee, proceed with
utmost caution.</i>

13:23.968 --> 13:26.368
Reconnaissance only.

13:26.437 --> 13:29.972
We will rendezvous at your coordinates.

13:39.350 --> 13:43.785
The autobots are persistent.
Time to meet their match.

14:03.206 --> 14:04.885
Bumblebee.

14:08.196 --> 14:11.913
Be on your guard.
My double could be anywhere.

14:16.053 --> 14:19.654
I'm sorry. What?

14:39.317 --> 14:43.120
Bumblebee.
Do you read?

14:44.523 --> 14:47.491
Fan out?

14:47.560 --> 14:52.096
And beware of anything
that might resemble me.

15:34.507 --> 15:38.208
If I can isolate the control
frequency of the remote link

15:38.277 --> 15:43.447
Silas is employing, I should be
able to pinpoint his exact position.

15:43.516 --> 15:44.414
Remote link?

15:44.483 --> 15:47.718
You didn't think M.E.C.H.
possessed the ability to build

15:47.787 --> 15:50.087
a completely autonomous
robot, did you?

15:50.156 --> 15:53.190
I was hoping Silas would be
operating the 'Bot from inside

15:53.259 --> 16:00.264
because one punch from Bulkhead,
and booyah!

16:00.933 --> 16:04.701
Aha!
Frequency isolated.

16:04.770 --> 16:06.770
Then reopen that bridge.

16:06.839 --> 16:11.038
Agent Fowler, did you not hear
Optimus advise against your involvement?

16:11.081 --> 16:12.910
It's for your own safety.

16:12.978 --> 16:15.979
Look, doc, I don't plan on
dancing with any 'Bots,

16:16.048 --> 16:19.283
but there's a human element in play
here, and in case you haven't

16:19.351 --> 16:24.421
noticed, I happen to be a highly
trained, government-grade... human.

16:24.490 --> 16:27.758
Yeah. Plus,
Silas tried to run him off the road.

16:27.827 --> 16:29.693
It's personal.

16:42.040 --> 16:45.342
<i>Optimus Prime.
We meet again.</i>

16:45.411 --> 16:50.013
- The deception ends here, Silas.
- Does it?

17:05.731 --> 17:09.333
I think I'm gonna toss
the breakfast I ate back in flight school.

17:16.474 --> 17:20.077
<i>Agent Fowler, the control
frequency is transmitting from</i>

17:20.145 --> 17:23.079
<i>a structure 100 meters due north.</i>

17:23.147 --> 17:24.548
Copy that.

17:48.873 --> 17:50.874
<i>My robot chassis possesses</i>

17:50.943 --> 17:54.411
<i>all your strength, speed,
and firepower.</i>

18:01.185 --> 18:04.588
Add my extensive combat
training, and M.E.C.H. has clearly

18:04.657 --> 18:08.091
achieved the perfect meld of
man and machine.

18:38.457 --> 18:42.059
<i>But the key difference
between you and me?</i>

18:42.127 --> 18:44.127
<i>My body can't feel pain!</i>

18:46.699 --> 18:48.398
<i>This is just the beginning.</i>

18:48.467 --> 18:51.969
<i>Imagine an army
of transforming robots.</i>

18:52.037 --> 18:56.373
No one will stand against the
newly rebooted M.E.C.H.

18:56.442 --> 18:58.942
<i>Think again, Si.</i>

18:59.011 --> 19:03.981
Agent Fowler in the flesh at last.

19:04.049 --> 19:07.451
And I'm pulling the plug on
your video game.

19:11.690 --> 19:13.190
Ex-military?

19:13.258 --> 19:16.493
Special tactics.
You?

19:19.531 --> 19:21.698
Army rangers.

19:21.767 --> 19:24.334
Retired, clearly.

19:24.403 --> 19:27.204
I may be out of shape,
but I don't need to bust you up.

19:33.479 --> 19:36.313
I just need to buy Prime
a little time.

19:53.297 --> 19:54.831
No. No!

20:07.745 --> 20:12.249
No! No!
Nooo!

20:21.093 --> 20:22.626
<i>Agent Fowler?</i>

20:26.565 --> 20:28.365
That would be our boys.

20:28.434 --> 20:30.634
I advise you to get back to
base, Prime.

20:30.702 --> 20:32.369
I'll handle uncle sam.

20:41.012 --> 20:44.047
So, how weird was it to see
someone who looked exactly like

20:44.116 --> 20:46.349
Optimus kicking the scrap
out of you?

20:47.219 --> 20:50.655
It's a sight I won't soon forget.

20:51.723 --> 20:54.558
The question remains whether
M.E.C.H. will continue to function

20:54.626 --> 20:57.727
as we know it...
without its leader.

20:57.796 --> 20:59.563
<i>Well, here's the kicker.</i>

20:59.631 --> 21:02.699
<i>We sifted through the wreckage
with a fine-tooth comb...</i>

21:02.768 --> 21:06.803
<i>and couldn't find any trace of Silas.</i>

21:08.140 --> 21:11.708
The internal damage to his
organs is massive and beyond the

21:11.777 --> 21:13.947
scope of conventional medicine.

21:14.012 --> 21:19.182
Fortunately for our leader,
M.E.C.H. is anything but conventional.
