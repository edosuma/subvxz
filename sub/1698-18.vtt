WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:03.050
Tonight you're going to see a special story.

00:03.390 --> 00:06.320
A pop star and her fight for love and glory.

00:06.990 --> 00:09.630
We wish it was a little bit more gory!

00:10.130 --> 00:13.010
But they said we had to tell a family story.

00:13.760 --> 00:16.239
In the tale we tell not everything is fair.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.650
And someone gets some news they cannot bare.

00:20.560 --> 00:23.040
You blow the end I'll kick your diary air!

00:23.730 --> 00:26.290
OK. OK. Our story starts in there!

00:26.320 --> 00:28.790
In there. In there. In there.

00:29.500 --> 00:33.260
I'm not going your way, I'm not going your way

00:33.290 --> 00:34.750
And when you're talking to me

00:34.750 --> 00:37.190
don't wanna hear the words that you say

00:37.210 --> 00:40.970
I'm not going your way, I'm not going your way

00:41.040 --> 00:42.220
I keep blind keep telling you

00:42.220 --> 00:45.600
telling you baby I'm just having fun just having fun

00:45.720 --> 00:49.620
And I'm just having fun, I'm just having fun

00:49.780 --> 00:51.620
Hey guys uh

00:51.820 --> 00:53.730
Y'all sound great it's just

00:54.040 --> 00:56.120
I mean the lyrics... I wrote them a month ago

00:56.160 --> 00:57.570
and they're starting to sound as tired as

00:57.590 --> 01:00.150
one of my dad's "back when I was in a band" stories.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.650
You know back when I was in a band -

01:02.690 --> 01:05.560
we didn't have cheese near this fancy

01:06.500 --> 01:08.190
We had nacho cheese.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.350
That's the cheese that we'd steal from ZZ Top's dressing room.

01:11.570 --> 01:13.090
There's some dude came up to me and said, hey

01:13.190 --> 01:15.890
that's not yo-cheese.

01:17.600 --> 01:19.910
Hey Hannah you know the lyrics aren't that bad.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.100
Yeah but they're not that good either.

01:22.810 --> 01:26.660
I'm not going your way, I'm not going your way

01:29.960 --> 01:33.250
I was only kidding. You look really pretty.

01:34.420 --> 01:36.170
Oh don't think I didn't notice you

01:36.170 --> 01:38.400
bailing on the one you said you love.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.710
Oliver, Lily is the one who loves you OK.

01:41.750 --> 01:44.410
Lola is dating Justin Timberlake according to

01:44.420 --> 01:46.590
some internet rumor I have no idea who started.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.120
Hey guys - y'all can take off.

01:50.130 --> 01:52.000
I've still got a little work to do on the lyrics.

01:52.130 --> 01:53.380
A little work?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.650
That's like saying Taylor Swift is a little bit cute.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.450
Oh what - you can fake date and I can't?

02:00.460 --> 02:01.460
-Yeah.  -...OK.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.690
Hey, wanna grab some lunch?

02:04.880 --> 02:08.660
Hey Jesse... you know that's really sweet

02:08.729 --> 02:10.460
but you know I kind of make it a thing

02:10.460 --> 02:11.530
not to date guys in my band...

02:11.570 --> 02:14.030
so if at some point you want to have lunch...

02:14.290 --> 02:17.570
you know that's cool but you know... just not "have lunch".

02:18.290 --> 02:20.520
OK yeah... cool.

02:22.990 --> 02:24.120
What are you doing?

02:24.820 --> 02:26.410
OK. If I were you

02:26.410 --> 02:30.320
I'd be grabbing lunch and staying for dessert.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.500
That'd be Lola talking right?

02:34.140 --> 02:35.210
Sure.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.890
Listen, you know... I know Jesse's really cute but...

02:39.970 --> 02:42.750
he's got a rep as a real player and

02:43.000 --> 02:44.540
my dad told me to steer clear of 'em.

02:44.930 --> 02:47.990
So... you're not going to date 'that guy'

02:48.640 --> 02:50.160
just because...

02:50.540 --> 02:52.740
That's nacho cheese...get it!

02:54.990 --> 02:56.860
...that guy told you not to?

02:56.900 --> 02:57.900
Absolutely.

03:02.810 --> 03:03.880
Why aren't you answering?

03:03.880 --> 03:04.580
It's nobody.

03:06.330 --> 03:09.220
-No, you're not seriously telling me that  -Telling you what?

03:09.280 --> 03:10.880
-I knew you'd be this way!  -What way?

03:10.880 --> 03:12.860
-Well how could you be so stupid!  -Why is she stupid?

03:12.890 --> 03:15.110
-Lily, you don't understand.  -I don't understand anything.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.140
Hi Jake!

03:18.210 --> 03:19.430
Hey Miley!

03:20.450 --> 03:21.860
I'm done filming for today.

03:21.860 --> 03:23.320
You want to meet at the usual place?

03:24.450 --> 03:25.570
It's Lily!

03:28.220 --> 03:33.860
I mean ah... your order of meat is ready at the usual place.

03:34.490 --> 03:35.630
Miley away.

03:36.760 --> 03:37.770
Bye bye!

03:40.700 --> 03:42.070
I forgot to tell you.

03:42.660 --> 03:44.010
I'm dating Jake Ryan!

03:45.170 --> 03:46.000
What?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.660
Oh keep up!

03:55.770 --> 03:58.560
You get the limo out front.

03:59.870 --> 04:03.390
Hottest styles, every shoe, every color.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.760
Yea when your famous it can be kinda fun.

04:07.170 --> 04:11.430
It's really you but no one ever discovers.

04:11.880 --> 04:15.410
Who would've thought that a girl like me

04:15.560 --> 04:20.769
would double as a superstar?

04:21.470 --> 04:25.400
You get the best of both worlds.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.450
Chill it out, take it slow,

04:27.550 --> 04:29.280
then you rock out the show.

04:29.280 --> 04:33.290
You get the best of both worlds.

04:33.550 --> 04:36.170
Mix it all together and you know that

04:36.180 --> 04:38.760
It's the best of both worlds.

04:39.380 --> 04:43.840
Hannah Montana  S03E18  He Could Be The One

04:43.980 --> 04:45.380
How could you not tell us?

04:45.600 --> 04:47.990
Look, I wanted to tell you, but

04:47.990 --> 04:50.510
I mean after everything that Jake and I have gone through

04:50.510 --> 04:51.750
I just knew that you would say...

04:51.830 --> 04:54.120
You are making the biggest mistake of your life!

04:55.470 --> 04:59.130
Yes, yes... but then I would have continued and said,

04:59.140 --> 05:00.150
you know, it's your life,

05:00.190 --> 05:03.150
and if that's what makes you happy, then who am I to judge?

05:03.150 --> 05:05.880
I mean, the heart, wants what it wants.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.550
Even if it's some... you know,

05:07.610 --> 05:10.960
goofy, klutzy guy who's not half as cool as he thinks he is.

05:11.750 --> 05:13.350
-Ain't that the truth...  -Yeah

05:13.870 --> 05:15.860
Wait a minute, we're still talking about Jake aren't we...

05:15.860 --> 05:16.390
Sure.

05:16.430 --> 05:20.000
Look, guys, it's not like I totally caved into Jake,

05:20.070 --> 05:22.270
I mean I made him work for it, I made him beg.

05:27.140 --> 05:28.120
Miley!

05:29.830 --> 05:32.320
I wouldn't blame you, if you never wanted to see me again...

05:32.670 --> 05:33.300
but...

05:33.310 --> 05:35.980
Jake!

05:39.370 --> 05:42.400
Yep. Miley Stewart kept her dignity!

05:42.440 --> 05:43.780
Good for you.

05:43.870 --> 05:45.620
I'm just amazed that your dad's cool with it,

05:45.620 --> 05:47.100
after everything he put you through,

05:47.150 --> 05:49.490
I mean, the whole, I kissed you, I'm leaving...

05:49.530 --> 05:51.190
I love you, I'm leaving.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.160
I'm spending the rest of my life with Traci, psych.

05:55.260 --> 05:57.590
Oh please. Like she told her dad,

05:57.670 --> 06:00.270
I mean it's probably been nothing but secret meetings,

06:00.270 --> 06:02.090
and late-night phone calls,

06:02.100 --> 06:04.500
oh and, I bet they even have code names for each other

06:04.500 --> 06:06.620
like "Falcon" and "Snowbird".

06:07.850 --> 06:09.300
You are so wrong!

06:11.000 --> 06:13.940
It's Anakin and Queen Amidala.

06:14.330 --> 06:15.470
So, I mean what are you going to do?

06:15.510 --> 06:17.440
I mean, you can't keep this secret from your dad forever.

06:17.650 --> 06:19.440
I'm not gonna, I just gotta continue to

06:19.440 --> 06:20.610
work on Jake's image...

06:20.670 --> 06:21.530
look at this.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.420
I got my publicity guy to get Jake Ryan

06:25.430 --> 06:26.710
and a pet adoption,

06:26.740 --> 06:28.300
in the front page of the newspaper.

06:28.350 --> 06:29.380
(Jake Ryan mugs for pugs)

06:29.380 --> 06:31.270
Dad loves dogs and I'm going to put this in the bathroom

06:31.270 --> 06:33.860
where Dad does his, you know... heavy reading.

06:35.500 --> 06:36.870
Not your cheese!

06:37.070 --> 06:39.250
Come on man, that's funny stuff!

06:39.440 --> 06:41.820
I swear your band has no sense of humour.

06:41.980 --> 06:43.240
You ready to go?

06:43.480 --> 06:47.520
-Look.  -Oh, look at that little puppy.

06:48.490 --> 06:49.660
Isn't he cute?

06:49.660 --> 06:50.710
So cute.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.370
Now, let's get you away from

06:53.370 --> 06:56.200
that miserable punk who broke my daughters heart!

06:59.050 --> 06:59.950
There.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.150
All better.

07:09.080 --> 07:11.340
Well their plan didn't work with the pictures of Jake,

07:11.340 --> 07:13.560
and she's wondering now what on Earth it will take,

07:13.560 --> 07:15.760
to make her dad like her beau, should she bake him a cake?

07:15.780 --> 07:17.980
-But wait, he likes pie.  -Yes, you're right, my mistake.

07:19.000 --> 07:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:29.570 --> 07:32.640
Talk about your sweet niblets! This looks incredible.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.040
Well, if all this...

07:36.140 --> 07:39.470
and... Mamaw's award-winning boysenberry pie

07:39.500 --> 07:41.910
isn't going to soften Dad up for the big Jake news...

07:41.920 --> 07:43.100
I don't know what will.

07:43.190 --> 07:44.960
Hey, you know what would really soften it up.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.640
If you dug out your old kitty sweater

07:46.640 --> 07:48.460
that he got you for your fourteenth birthday...

07:49.000 --> 07:49.930
...oh my.

07:52.870 --> 07:54.170
Now that's commitment.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.060
Tell me about it. But argh...

07:56.290 --> 07:57.870
if you see me turning blue,

07:57.940 --> 07:59.420
grab one of these butter knives and

07:59.420 --> 08:01.580
cut me out of this poly cotton death trap.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.390
Yeah sure You got it.

08:04.700 --> 08:07.150
Mmm, hey this is really good, what is it?

08:07.240 --> 08:09.670
Oh, it's dad's favourite, it's argh... catfish stew.

08:09.830 --> 08:11.500
-What's this?  -No, no, no, no!

08:11.560 --> 08:13.020
Oh this is great!

08:14.050 --> 08:16.300
It really bursts with flavour.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.680
That's the eyeball!

08:20.000 --> 08:23.310
Hey! That's the best part!

08:24.540 --> 08:26.900
Now I'm going to have to give dad the other one.

08:28.310 --> 08:30.180
Excuse me, I'm just gonna go argh...

08:30.340 --> 08:32.620
walk through the carwash with my mouth open!

08:34.120 --> 08:38.400
Lily! Hey... how you been?

08:38.620 --> 08:42.000
Nah, don't you 'how you been' me, Anakin. OK.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.890
I got my eye on you.

08:44.150 --> 08:45.750
And so does that stew!

08:47.150 --> 08:49.240
Jake, what are you doing here,

08:49.240 --> 08:50.450
my dad's going to be home any minute.

08:50.510 --> 08:51.990
I don't care, I...

08:52.880 --> 08:56.440
Whoa. That sweater... is adorable.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.140
I'm only wearing it because my dad gave it to me, but,

08:59.160 --> 09:00.580
thanks for the fake compliment.

09:00.580 --> 09:01.860
Good boyfriend stuff, keep it up.

09:04.530 --> 09:06.600
Well the meow of you too!

09:06.640 --> 09:08.120
That was my sweater!

09:08.890 --> 09:11.090
Seriously, you 'gotta get out of here before my dad sees you.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.470
No, no, no. Look, I don't care if he sees me.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.890
I'm tired of sneaking around behind his back,

09:15.890 --> 09:16.760
we need to tell him.

09:17.650 --> 09:18.380
And we will.

09:18.380 --> 09:21.010
You know I've just gotta give him a spoonful of catfish and...

09:21.310 --> 09:22.630
my eyeball!

09:23.440 --> 09:24.290
What?

09:24.590 --> 09:25.880
Never mind.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.780
Just, you 'gotta trust me on this Jake.

09:27.790 --> 09:29.520
I'm gonna feed him, and then,

09:29.520 --> 09:31.380
I'm going to close the deal by argh...

09:31.590 --> 09:32.940
showing him this movie

09:32.980 --> 09:36.740
about a dad who hates the guy that he's daughter's dating,

09:36.790 --> 09:37.990
but learns to love him anyways.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.500
I was up for that part!

09:39.760 --> 09:41.330
But apparently Shia LaBuff

09:41.330 --> 09:44.000
has bigger box office appeal.

09:44.530 --> 09:45.490
Dad's home!

09:45.600 --> 09:48.230
I mean my box office is just as big as his!

09:48.440 --> 09:51.070
Oh, sure it is honey, we'll talk about that later.

09:51.610 --> 09:54.080
OK but I'm coming back after the movie

09:54.100 --> 09:55.910
whether it works or not. We're telling your Dad.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.430
OK, OK, just leave!

09:57.490 --> 10:00.800
Because when Jake Ryan loves a girl, he...

10:00.810 --> 10:02.920
...Never gives up! I get it! Get out.

10:03.400 --> 10:04.250
Bye

10:05.350 --> 10:07.020
Actors!

10:10.560 --> 10:13.750
Yee doggies! Is that catfish stew I smell?

10:13.750 --> 10:14.830
Surprise Daddy!

10:17.010 --> 10:18.030
Now, hold on here.

10:18.710 --> 10:21.610
My favorite stew, boysenberry pie...

10:21.890 --> 10:23.640
and you got on that little kitty sweater

10:23.650 --> 10:25.230
I got you a couple of years ago?

10:26.090 --> 10:27.520
Miley Ray Stewart, you want something.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.490
I just want my Daddy to know how much I love him.

10:33.310 --> 10:36.200
This is gonna cost me big time, but I'm OK with it,

10:36.200 --> 10:37.500
as long as I get an eyeball.

10:38.510 --> 10:39.730
Dang Lily!

10:45.330 --> 10:47.080
Wasn't that a touching movie?

10:47.590 --> 10:49.770
The way that that dad learned how to

10:49.770 --> 10:52.210
accept the boy that his daughter loves.

10:52.880 --> 10:56.280
Now that is a role model for supportive parenting.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.610
I'm just saying.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.630
I 'gotta admit, heartwarming story...

11:01.860 --> 11:03.230
It's a nice movie.

11:03.620 --> 11:04.790
Certainly was.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.830
-...It was all a bunch of hooie!  -Hoo what?

11:10.490 --> 11:12.070
There ain't no father in his right mind gonna forgive

11:12.070 --> 11:15.390
that slime ball kid for what he did for hurting his daughter.

11:16.860 --> 11:18.050
I know I wouldn't.

11:18.050 --> 11:21.950
Oh, Dad. You don't mean that!

11:22.360 --> 11:23.870
How about a fourth piece of pie?

11:23.960 --> 11:25.510
Oh, sounds good but

11:26.060 --> 11:29.070
You know what now I'm too agitated thinking about

11:29.080 --> 11:31.910
what I do to that kid for breaking my daughter's heart!

11:33.500 --> 11:35.940
It'd get mighty ugly, I'll tell you what.

11:44.110 --> 11:48.310
Slime-ball stew! my favorite.

11:48.390 --> 11:50.870
No, Mr Stewart please!

11:50.880 --> 11:52.410
Miley will never forgive you!

11:52.460 --> 11:54.180
Oh, sure she will.

11:54.350 --> 11:57.430
As long as she gets an eyeball!

12:10.020 --> 12:11.440
Where'd that breeze come from?

12:11.600 --> 12:16.920
From that dry, baron wasteland of your cold, cold heart!

12:17.490 --> 12:18.240
Huh?

12:18.360 --> 12:19.250
Never mind.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.900
And you are doing the dishes tonight,

12:21.020 --> 12:24.720
you movie-hating, eyeball-hogging hillbilly! Whoa!

12:25.660 --> 12:27.900
No, I'm not running away!

12:28.000 --> 12:28.750
Oh boy

12:29.240 --> 12:30.810
I'm through hiding!

12:31.370 --> 12:31.950
Jake!

12:34.110 --> 12:35.090
What are you doing?

12:35.170 --> 12:36.790
Standing up for us!

12:37.220 --> 12:40.050
And... protecting my face. Filming tomorrow.

12:42.240 --> 12:45.610
Listen, Mr Stewart, I'm in love with your daughter,

12:45.730 --> 12:48.790
and you're just going to have to deal with it... sir?

12:50.210 --> 12:52.650
OK. I just got one question.

12:52.740 --> 12:53.740
Who are you?

12:58.140 --> 13:00.100
We've been dating for the past three weeks.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.770
Three weeks, two days, and eight and a half hours.

13:04.180 --> 13:06.870
Oh, babe, you got the hours...

13:06.930 --> 13:08.080
I invented that myself!

13:08.250 --> 13:09.980
I didn't even have my assistant to do it.

13:11.390 --> 13:12.660
Now is he a keeper or what!

13:12.710 --> 13:14.590
I think I could just wrap him in a recycling bag

13:14.590 --> 13:15.530
and take him home!

13:18.060 --> 13:19.080
Alright, Dad, look.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.660
Go ahead, and yell at me.

13:21.890 --> 13:23.780
Tell me how much you don't like him,

13:23.790 --> 13:25.920
tell me I'm making the biggest mistake of my life,

13:25.930 --> 13:27.530
because no matter what you say,

13:27.530 --> 13:29.130
it's not going to make a difference.

13:29.670 --> 13:31.470
I just can't believe you kept this from me.

13:31.770 --> 13:34.150
I thought we had a better relationship than that.

13:34.570 --> 13:36.040
Evidently I was wrong.

13:39.350 --> 13:40.550
So was I...

13:41.720 --> 13:43.440
that did make a difference.

13:50.370 --> 13:54.380
Well Robby's mad... and Miley's sad.

13:55.160 --> 13:59.290
Normally this, will make me glad

13:59.580 --> 14:01.950
She's on her knees, she's begging please...

14:01.970 --> 14:04.420
give her the chance of true romance!

14:04.490 --> 14:06.580
She wanna things to be more better,

14:06.780 --> 14:10.930
she even wore that kitty sweater. Meow!

14:17.620 --> 14:21.610
What will she say? To Robby Ray?

14:22.420 --> 14:28.950
If you 'wanna know, don't go away! Oohh yeah!

14:33.160 --> 14:35.530
Oooh, boxing.

14:36.150 --> 14:38.500
Nothing brings a father and daughter together more than

14:38.700 --> 14:41.250
two grown men beating the snot out of each other.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.410
Oh, that's gonna leave a mark.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.530
But, I don't care...

14:46.550 --> 14:47.970
I mean, this is just so nice.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.940
Hey, daddy! Nacho cheese!

14:58.620 --> 15:00.110
I get it now!

15:01.200 --> 15:02.250
It's funny.

15:08.030 --> 15:10.410
Hey Daddy, I'm trying to decide on what to

15:10.420 --> 15:13.000
wear to next year's "Tween-Scene Awards".

15:13.010 --> 15:14.980
I mean, I'm not nominated yet, but

15:15.200 --> 15:17.090
with the incredible songs that you write,

15:17.090 --> 15:18.450
I know I'm a true win.

15:18.650 --> 15:20.120
So, what do you think?

15:20.320 --> 15:21.930
It doesn't matter what I think.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.640
You're gonna pick what you want anyway and then not tell me

15:24.690 --> 15:27.160
until he walks into my house hiding behind a surfboard.

15:28.540 --> 15:31.640
Fine. I guess I just won't wear anything.

15:33.060 --> 15:34.940
All natural

15:35.790 --> 15:37.730
My birthday suit

15:38.870 --> 15:40.260
My skin sweater

15:41.350 --> 15:42.270
Whatever.

15:52.160 --> 15:53.370
Hey, big guy.

15:53.690 --> 15:55.890
Remember that one time that I, argh, tried to go to

15:55.890 --> 15:58.450
Florida all alone even though you said I couldn't.

15:58.800 --> 16:01.580
Whoa, were you mad at me!

16:02.440 --> 16:04.490
But then you wrote that beautiful song called

16:04.490 --> 16:05.340
"Ready, Set, Don't Go,"

16:05.690 --> 16:09.270
and we had a deeper richer relationship.

16:12.150 --> 16:13.800
Not to mention a number one song!

16:13.800 --> 16:15.990
Argh, talk about your biscuits and gravy.

16:16.610 --> 16:19.030
So argh, how about we write a song about

16:19.030 --> 16:20.470
what we're going through right now.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.370
I'll start.

16:23.200 --> 16:27.140
I want the best for my girl,

16:27.260 --> 16:30.740
she can date any guy, do do dah.

16:30.820 --> 16:34.690
Here we go, I want the best for my girl!

16:34.970 --> 16:38.560
Mix it all together and... just the guys now!

16:51.820 --> 16:55.470
I don't care what you say, I don't care what you say

16:55.530 --> 16:59.080
Just cause you're my daddy doesn't mean you get it your way

16:59.180 --> 17:02.640
Meany meany meaner, you're so meaner meaner

17:03.000 --> 17:04.069
What do you think?

17:04.990 --> 17:06.000
Truth or lying?

17:06.109 --> 17:06.790
Lying, please.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.050
-Whoa!  -Best song ever!

17:09.180 --> 17:10.510
I know, it's terrible.

17:10.670 --> 17:12.760
-Stinkin'.  -Worst song ever

17:12.990 --> 17:15.920
Come on, you guys, I just can't concentrate.

17:16.390 --> 17:20.150
I mean, as long as I keep dating Jake Dad's gonna be mad,

17:20.160 --> 17:22.410
and, if I stop dating Jake I'm gonna be mad.

17:23.020 --> 17:26.140
Whoa. That's... tough.

17:27.069 --> 17:29.650
That's tough? That's all you got?

17:29.810 --> 17:31.690
I mean, if it was your problem,

17:31.760 --> 17:32.830
I would come up with

17:32.830 --> 17:35.000
some crazy plan that would ultimately fix everything.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.580
Someone forgot to bring a present to the friendship party!

17:42.020 --> 17:44.840
I hope she's talking about you, 'cause I bought nothing.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.900
This is not fair! I give you great ideas all the time, OK.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.590
Remember last week, when we didn't know what to do,

17:53.600 --> 17:55.740
and I suggested, "let's go to a movie".

17:56.280 --> 17:57.310
And we did.

17:57.370 --> 17:59.360
And then afterwards, you were hungry,

17:59.380 --> 18:02.170
and I suggested pizza. And you loved it!

18:02.180 --> 18:05.010
OK, that's two great ideas in one night.

18:05.170 --> 18:07.330
Need I go on? I think not!

18:10.000 --> 18:11.660
Hey Mr Stewart, how's it going?

18:11.810 --> 18:14.500
Well it doesn't really matter how I think it's going, does it?

18:16.380 --> 18:18.950
Why don't you ask my daughter how she thinks it's going,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.100
that's all that seems to matter in my house!

18:22.790 --> 18:24.160
OK, then.

18:24.220 --> 18:27.430
I'm just gonna sit here, eat my shrimp and avoid eye contact.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.330
But, Jesse, I love you!

18:31.770 --> 18:33.270
It can't be over.

18:33.300 --> 18:35.760
Look Rachel, I have been telling you for weeks,

18:35.780 --> 18:37.430
I am just not feeling it anymore.

18:39.940 --> 18:40.870
I'm sorry.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.620
OK. Bye

18:46.760 --> 18:48.290
Hey, Jesse, you and I need to have a little...

18:48.290 --> 18:49.330
Hang on, boss.

18:49.410 --> 18:51.150
Two, one...

18:52.960 --> 18:55.660
Fine, I'll go, I have my pride

18:55.730 --> 18:59.640
Just don't you even think about calling me at my new number.

18:59.730 --> 19:01.960
Five, five, five, zero, one, two, nine.

19:02.060 --> 19:05.000
Just get 5550129 out of your head,

19:05.020 --> 19:06.590
'cause I won't answer!

19:08.300 --> 19:11.100
-Hey, listen, man, you and I, we need to...  -Not quite.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.310
And I mean it!

19:13.610 --> 19:16.710
Never call 5550129.

19:17.310 --> 19:20.560
Even though we're on the same plan, it'll cost you.

19:23.020 --> 19:24.740
OK, that's usually it.

19:24.750 --> 19:26.450
Sounds like you go through this quite a bit.

19:26.490 --> 19:27.660
Yeah. Chicks, huh?

19:27.670 --> 19:28.690
Well it better stop.

19:29.710 --> 19:30.670
Hey, listen, man,

19:30.670 --> 19:32.590
I don't like the fact that you keep showing up late,

19:32.630 --> 19:34.450
and I really don't like the way you treat chicks.

19:34.500 --> 19:37.160
-But...  -And I hate the fact that you keep interrupting me.

19:37.470 --> 19:38.750
Now, you're a good guitar player,

19:38.750 --> 19:39.710
but you're not that dang good.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.590
You better pull yourself together or get out.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.730
OK, OK. It won't happen again.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.330
Whoa. Your dad does not like Jesse.

19:50.360 --> 19:51.510
Not kidding.

19:52.090 --> 19:54.730
I mean, he pushes his buttons.

19:55.000 --> 19:58.660
He's late... he's mean to girls...

19:59.000 --> 20:01.530
heck, the only button he hasn't pushed is...

20:01.570 --> 20:03.290
Who ate the last apple fritter?

20:08.150 --> 20:10.240
Whoa. Man, imagine if you had gone out

20:10.240 --> 20:11.380
with Jesse when he asked you.

20:11.410 --> 20:15.810
I know. I mean compared to Jesse, Jake is like...

20:15.980 --> 20:19.330
one, big, yummy catfish eyeball!

20:21.000 --> 20:22.360
Hey, hey. Wait, I got it!

20:22.500 --> 20:25.420
OK, after rehearsal, you get Jesse to ask you out,

20:25.490 --> 20:28.350
making sure your dad can hear, which of course, freaks him out

20:28.450 --> 20:29.080
and you say,

20:29.080 --> 20:31.620
"Oh, oh, would you rather I date Jake?"

20:31.700 --> 20:34.500
and he says, "Yes, anybody but, Mr always late,

20:34.500 --> 20:36.450
mean to girls, eats apple fritter guy!"

20:37.020 --> 20:39.520
Boo ya! Another great idea from the mind

20:39.520 --> 20:41.550
that brought you movies and a pizza!

20:41.660 --> 20:42.510
Finally!

20:47.440 --> 20:52.520
Let's do this

20:54.620 --> 20:56.740
Yeah! Great rehearsal everybody.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.130
'Course, that's just my opinion.

20:59.350 --> 21:00.810
It probably doesn't mean much.

21:01.700 --> 21:02.520
Alright.

21:03.550 --> 21:06.450
That's it. Time for operation 'Dad's da-loob'.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.230
What?

21:07.390 --> 21:08.300
Dad's da-loob.

21:08.300 --> 21:10.480
Operation Date a bad boy so Jake looks better.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.460
D'argh!

21:11.840 --> 21:14.480
Whoa. You two are freaky.

21:15.860 --> 21:19.520
Hey, hey Jesse. Can I talk to you for a minute in private?

21:19.670 --> 21:20.370
Sure, we can go...

21:20.370 --> 21:23.820
No, no, no, no. It's way to drafty, bad for the pipes.

21:23.830 --> 21:28.490
M... M... M... Much better, right here!

21:29.580 --> 21:32.090
Argh, yeah. Under the air vent.

21:32.210 --> 21:34.770
Much better. So, what's up?

21:35.230 --> 21:37.920
Yeah, remember the other day when you, argh, you know...

21:38.070 --> 21:40.070
Yeah, Gary, listen. Robby Ray here,

21:40.120 --> 21:42.120
let me take this outside for a second...

21:42.230 --> 21:45.170
Oh, you're right, it's like a meat locker in here! Let's go!

21:47.000 --> 21:48.170
Yeah, listen, Gary, I think we're going to

21:48.170 --> 21:50.380
have to flip the boat of the show at the Seattle date.

21:50.950 --> 21:51.620
Aha?

21:51.840 --> 21:54.140
Yeah, so um, you remember the other day when you argh...

21:54.210 --> 21:55.360
Asked me out!

21:55.780 --> 21:57.330
I'm right here!

21:57.560 --> 21:58.990
Yeah, let me take this outside,

21:58.990 --> 22:01.270
these folks have evidently never been out of the house before.

22:03.380 --> 22:04.990
So, you wanna go out?

22:05.020 --> 22:05.630
What!

22:06.220 --> 22:08.990
-Do you want to go out?  -What!

22:09.730 --> 22:12.630
Do you wanna go out? And that's as loud as I'm doing it.

22:14.450 --> 22:15.960
Oh, I think that did the trick.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.820
Hannah, I'm not sure what's going on, but...

22:17.960 --> 22:18.970
Well I am.

22:19.010 --> 22:21.210
See, Hannah likes a boy that I don't like.

22:21.310 --> 22:23.240
And she knows that I don't like you.

22:23.490 --> 22:26.550
So she's asked you out hoping that I don't like you

22:26.610 --> 22:29.100
more than the boy that I don't like that she does.

22:29.770 --> 22:30.550
Simple.

22:31.030 --> 22:32.280
Dad, that's not true.

22:32.530 --> 22:33.850
I really like Jesse,

22:33.880 --> 22:37.000
because he is an apple-fritter stealing bad boy.

22:37.460 --> 22:38.830
Bad to the bone.

22:40.080 --> 22:42.270
Oh, Okey-dokey.

22:42.580 --> 22:44.460
In that case, here's the keys to my car,

22:44.460 --> 22:45.620
have her home by morning.

22:45.640 --> 22:46.590
What?

22:46.830 --> 22:49.580
Do you see the words "FOOL" written on this forehead?

22:50.000 --> 22:52.210
I weren't a fool yesterday and I ain't one today.

22:52.650 --> 22:53.610
Neither am I.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.150
And I don't like being liked just to prove that

22:56.150 --> 22:58.810
I am less likeable than some other guy that he doesn't like.

22:59.080 --> 23:02.110
And yeah, I did eat the apple fritter, and it was good.

23:05.320 --> 23:06.330
Hi!

23:07.160 --> 23:08.430
Hope you like the show.

23:10.220 --> 23:11.930
We weren't ears dropping!

23:13.610 --> 23:17.480
-We were just... -filling ourselves in, ahead of time,

23:17.550 --> 23:19.350
to save you the trouble later.

23:19.350 --> 23:22.650
-It's really a consideration thing.  -Yeah...

23:22.720 --> 23:24.710
-We...  -Yeah, we'll see you at home.

23:26.170 --> 23:29.590
Dad. I'm gonna' date Jake.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.390
I just don't want to do it behind your back.

23:33.950 --> 23:37.140
Well, I don't want you to do that either.

23:38.090 --> 23:39.410
So what are we going to do about it?

23:42.640 --> 23:44.680
I guess we'll do it like we do everything else.

23:45.240 --> 23:46.970
Take one step at a time.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.880
You know, I'm still not sure I like that boy, but

23:50.670 --> 23:52.380
you went through all that trouble,

23:52.380 --> 23:54.150
I should at least give you a chance.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.020
I love you, Dad.

23:56.680 --> 24:00.270
-Unless you were to change your mind...  -Daddy!

24:01.220 --> 24:02.230
You're right, you're right.

24:02.600 --> 24:05.770
Bad parenting. I should be ashamed.

24:06.120 --> 24:07.730
Unless you were to change your mind then...

24:07.740 --> 24:08.970
Afraid not, big guy.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.120
No offense, but

24:14.280 --> 24:16.570
what in the same heck am I doing sitting here hugging you?

24:16.580 --> 24:18.550
I got a boyfriend to call! Bye

24:22.920 --> 24:26.030
They're no longer in a fight, man.

24:26.170 --> 24:28.970
Everything gonna be alright, man.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.920
All day and all the night, man.

24:36.220 --> 24:37.750
Or is it, man?

24:40.090 --> 24:42.190
Jake, I couldn't wait to tell you...

24:44.890 --> 24:46.090
I'll call you back.

24:48.160 --> 24:49.030
Jesse.

24:50.360 --> 24:51.310
Hey, man, listen.

24:52.440 --> 24:54.560
I'm really sorry about the whole dating thing.

24:54.590 --> 24:55.330
Forget it!

24:55.680 --> 24:57.630
Come on, Jesse, you can't be mad,

24:57.650 --> 24:59.340
I mean it's not like we were together or anything.

24:59.970 --> 25:00.970
Jesse!

25:01.560 --> 25:02.500
Oh, come on!

25:03.900 --> 25:04.980
Come on!

25:05.990 --> 25:06.870
Jesse?

25:08.430 --> 25:10.580
I'm happy for you. Looks like you got what you wanted.

25:11.620 --> 25:15.870
Okey... still sensing a little bit of edge here.

25:16.820 --> 25:18.310
Oh, I get it.

25:19.190 --> 25:21.600
Someone's used to being in control!

25:22.810 --> 25:23.830
Am I right?

25:25.310 --> 25:26.670
Am I right?

25:27.040 --> 25:28.230
Who's right? I am!

25:29.160 --> 25:31.460
I really like you, OK?

25:32.370 --> 25:33.200
What?

25:33.610 --> 25:37.320
Don't worry about it. I am a big boy, and I will get over it.

25:39.190 --> 25:40.420
Besides, it's pretty obvious

25:40.420 --> 25:42.050
that you're winning this other guy.

25:42.470 --> 25:43.390
I am.

25:43.970 --> 25:47.970
Well. He's very lucky... and I hope he knows it.

25:48.830 --> 25:49.990
Thanks.

25:50.350 --> 25:53.440
I mean... I kinda think that he could be the one.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.530
That's a good line for a song.

25:57.150 --> 25:58.940
I mean, I'd lose the whole kinda part,

25:58.980 --> 26:00.870
it makes it sound a little bit one foot in, one foot out.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.540
Yeah...

26:05.300 --> 26:06.370
he could be the one.

26:08.330 --> 26:12.700
He could be the one. He could be the one.

26:12.790 --> 26:16.470
He could be the one.

26:16.500 --> 26:20.450
He could be the one. He could be the one.

26:20.480 --> 26:24.160
He could be the one.

26:24.600 --> 26:25.990
He's lightning

26:26.350 --> 26:28.050
Sparks are flyin'

26:28.320 --> 26:31.860
Everywhere I go he's always on my mind and

26:32.160 --> 26:33.830
I'm goin' crazy

26:34.000 --> 26:35.870
About him lately

26:37.740 --> 26:40.780
I can't help myself from how my heart is racing

26:41.630 --> 26:42.520
Perfect!

26:43.210 --> 26:47.330
And I can't help myself from how my heart is racing

26:47.870 --> 26:53.160
And I think I'm really digging on his vibe

26:54.430 --> 26:58.010
He really blows me away

26:58.540 --> 27:02.440
He's got something special, He's got something special

27:02.530 --> 27:06.330
And when he's looking at me I wanna get all sentimental

27:06.840 --> 27:08.470
Smooth-talking

27:08.820 --> 27:10.280
So rockin'

27:10.610 --> 27:13.770
He's got everything that a girl's wantin'

27:14.190 --> 27:15.650
He's such a cutie

27:15.890 --> 27:17.570
He's getting to me

27:17.610 --> 27:20.750
And when he's walking to his room it's like a movie

27:20.770 --> 27:23.860
Think I'm really falling for his smile

27:24.040 --> 27:27.140
Get butterflies when he says my name

27:27.560 --> 27:31.260
He's got something special, He's got something special

27:31.270 --> 27:34.770
And when he's talking to me I wanna get all sentimental

27:34.970 --> 27:38.410
He's got something special, He's got something special

27:38.580 --> 27:40.520
I can hardly breathe, something telling me,

27:40.520 --> 27:44.830
telling me maybe he could be the one

27:46.630 --> 27:48.210
Oh, look at you.

27:48.260 --> 27:50.350
You're all chocked up, come here.

27:52.650 --> 27:53.890
I love the song.

27:54.140 --> 27:56.410
And I love that you wrote it just for me.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.130
Yep... that's what I did.

28:12.290 --> 28:16.200
First Miley had a guy, who she had to hide.

28:16.530 --> 28:20.210
But her daddy said OK and she was satisfied.

28:20.620 --> 28:22.830
Then Jesse came and knocked her cool,

28:22.840 --> 28:24.830
and Miley turned into a fool.

28:24.850 --> 28:26.760
A fool for love.

28:26.890 --> 28:29.150
She needs help from above!

28:29.520 --> 28:32.420
Now Jesse's here, and so is Jake.

28:32.930 --> 28:36.760
But which one will she pick so she won't make a huge mistake?

28:37.120 --> 28:39.240
Jake, as cute as he can be.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.270
But Jesse brings some mystery.

28:41.350 --> 28:43.340
Which will she choose? Which guy will win?

28:43.380 --> 28:45.620
Which guy will lose? Say hey!

28:51.580 --> 28:55.180
I can't believe it, everything is finally working out for us!

28:55.460 --> 28:56.710
Sure is.

29:01.680 --> 29:04.030
I, argh... got a tickle.

29:04.050 --> 29:05.010
Really?

29:05.060 --> 29:06.630
Yeah, you know, I wouldn't want to

29:06.630 --> 29:09.440
kiss you and then sneeze on you

29:09.460 --> 29:11.020
and get you all Jesse... messy!

29:11.100 --> 29:13.110
Get you all messy.

29:13.160 --> 29:16.110
Yeah, I... get you sick too. Whoa, would not want that.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.170
I think it's worth the risk.

29:18.210 --> 29:21.040
Not me! Yeah Not me! Because, argh...

29:21.100 --> 29:23.030
I care too much about you, mister.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.050
So I'm going to be strong for the both of us and say,

29:25.060 --> 29:27.050
see you later guitar player... Gladiator!

29:28.750 --> 29:30.120
See you later guitar player's

29:30.120 --> 29:32.360
what I used to say to my Dad when I was little.

29:32.700 --> 29:35.090
'Cause, my dad's a guitar player.

29:36.710 --> 29:38.120
Whoa, yep that's fever.

29:39.340 --> 29:42.720
OK, well you get some rest and feel better

29:42.870 --> 29:44.040
and know that I am thinking about you

29:44.040 --> 29:45.710
every minute until I see you again,

29:45.740 --> 29:48.890
and when I fall asleep, I'll dream about you.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.260
Are you going to dream about me?

29:51.390 --> 29:52.880
Oh, I sure hope so.

29:55.140 --> 29:59.590
But, you know, dreams, they're uncontrollable little suckers.

30:00.260 --> 30:02.770
Can't control what pops into your head but

29:59.600 --> 30:00.230
Yeah.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.450
it could be you, could be a sandwich, I mean,

30:05.470 --> 30:07.370
your Jess... guess.

30:07.470 --> 30:10.060
Your guess is just as good as mine.

30:10.640 --> 30:11.670
Air kiss, bye!

30:15.680 --> 30:18.940
Lily, it's me. You have got to get over here right now!

30:19.210 --> 30:21.470
Yeah, Miley, I'm a little busy right now.

30:21.530 --> 30:23.780
-Pulling, pulling, pulling!  -I'm sorry!

30:24.560 --> 30:26.450
Oliver's got this big knot in his hair

30:26.450 --> 30:27.470
and I'm trying to get it out with a...

30:27.510 --> 30:30.230
-Hurting, hurting, hurting!  -Sorry, honey!

30:30.800 --> 30:33.600
Lily, I mean it! Right now, it's code red!

30:33.690 --> 30:35.430
Code red!

30:35.840 --> 30:37.490
Why didn't you say so?

30:39.050 --> 30:40.980
Man, you weren't kidding about that knot.

30:44.580 --> 30:46.420
And he thought I couldn't get it out.

30:59.980 --> 31:02.250
Oh my gosh, you're in love with Jesse?

31:02.250 --> 31:03.210
Not in love with Jesse!

31:03.220 --> 31:06.050
And yet you're seeing his head on Jake's body?

31:06.060 --> 31:07.020
Interesting...

31:08.100 --> 31:09.160
OK, fine!

31:09.580 --> 31:11.750
I'm a little bit attracted to him, but...

31:11.860 --> 31:13.060
I can control it.

31:13.440 --> 31:14.920
Because I am not gonna let this ruin

31:14.930 --> 31:16.560
you know, what I have with Jake.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.270
I mean, we have such... history, we have way too much history

31:19.380 --> 31:20.640
you know throw it away

31:20.640 --> 31:24.940
on some intense, imbruting, passionate,

31:25.580 --> 31:29.950
strong... yet sensitive guy...

31:30.060 --> 31:30.700
Miley!

31:30.970 --> 31:33.540
Who has his warm, brown eyes...

31:33.720 --> 31:37.130
that move you like the moon with the tide,

31:37.260 --> 31:40.300
you know, it...dances, dances all the time itself.

31:41.530 --> 31:43.250
Well, as long as you can control it.

31:44.090 --> 31:45.360
Control what?

31:46.000 --> 31:47.090
Oh boy!

31:48.290 --> 31:51.790
Whoa! Nothing like a two mile run to make a man

31:51.790 --> 31:53.090
feel the one in the world.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.200
Great, must be nice to be you.

31:57.620 --> 32:00.590
Well, hello to you little Miss Mood Swing!

32:01.600 --> 32:03.890
I thought you'd be all happy now that everything is

32:03.890 --> 32:05.180
in the open with you and Jake.

32:05.250 --> 32:08.500
I am happy! I'm thrilled.

32:09.370 --> 32:13.210
Overjoyed. Ecstatic!

32:16.790 --> 32:18.130
Isn't that right Lily?

32:20.810 --> 32:23.100
Right, yeah, happy!

32:23.250 --> 32:24.270
Never seen her happier,

32:24.270 --> 32:26.280
is that the face of a happy girl or what!

32:28.000 --> 32:31.450
OK, then... argh, you should be excited to know that

32:31.480 --> 32:33.430
I was thinking about inviting Jake over for dinner

32:33.490 --> 32:35.540
so he and I can get to know each other a little better!

32:36.140 --> 32:38.940
Yeah, that sounds like a great idea!

32:39.180 --> 32:41.410
Having Jake over for dinner, 'cause he's my boyfriend.

32:42.230 --> 32:43.900
My only boyfriend.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.750
The only one that I want.

32:46.260 --> 32:47.740
The only one that I need.

32:48.730 --> 32:49.990
You get that, mister!

32:51.190 --> 32:54.000
Sweet niblets! Honey, what I'm trying to say is, argh,

32:54.000 --> 32:56.390
you and I need a little code word for

32:56.390 --> 32:59.280
when you're dealing with these teenage girl things.

32:59.740 --> 33:03.220
Something like... the walrus sings at midnight.

33:05.220 --> 33:06.840
The walrus sings at Midnight?

33:07.000 --> 33:08.920
The walrus sings at midnight, that's it.

33:09.150 --> 33:13.830
Daddy, the walrus sings at midnight!

33:15.230 --> 33:17.740
Right, I get it I get it, argh...

33:17.820 --> 33:19.200
I might go for another run,

33:19.200 --> 33:21.840
a little more wonders with the world you know what I mean.

33:23.380 --> 33:27.500
I have got... I have got to get over this stupid Jesse thing!

33:27.660 --> 33:30.000
How? I mean, you're with him like every day!

33:30.480 --> 33:31.910
I know, but I'm a professional.

33:32.000 --> 33:33.280
I can shake it off.

33:33.300 --> 33:35.360
Really? OK, alright, well...

33:36.000 --> 33:38.790
Let's say this cookie jar is Jessie. OK?

33:38.960 --> 33:42.800
And he's playing, and your eyes meet as you're singing,

33:42.910 --> 33:45.940
He could be the one, He could be the one...

33:51.780 --> 33:54.360
Miley? Miley!

33:56.150 --> 33:57.540
-Miley! -Arghh!

33:59.480 --> 34:01.370
That was not me, that was the cookie jar!

34:02.030 --> 34:03.250
He made the first move.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.510
The toaster warned me about you, mister!

34:06.350 --> 34:07.520
Bad monkey.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.050
Miley, you just kissed a ceramic monkey

34:12.050 --> 34:13.260
and then broke up with it!

34:15.780 --> 34:17.110
How are you going to control yourself

34:17.110 --> 34:18.550
when you see the real Jesse, I mean,

34:18.580 --> 34:20.320
put a paper bag over his head?

34:22.830 --> 34:24.150
Of course not,

34:24.150 --> 34:26.659
come on, Lily, that is, that is ridiculous.

34:27.810 --> 34:29.929
I can hardly breathe, something telling me,

34:29.940 --> 34:32.530
telling me maybe he could be the one

34:32.699 --> 34:38.230
he could be the one. he could be the one.

34:38.429 --> 34:42.100
he could be the one. he could be the one.

34:42.239 --> 34:47.050
he could be the one.

34:47.770 --> 34:49.449
OK, this is not working!

34:50.120 --> 34:52.679
That's because you, are not giving it a chance.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.870
Kids are going to love the whole you know

34:54.870 --> 34:57.090
"Hannah Mont-animal" thing.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.250
It's going to be great for the tour!

34:59.310 --> 35:02.160
Because it's like the circus, with music.

35:02.350 --> 35:06.880
Am I right? I am always thinking. Always... whoa!

35:10.890 --> 35:11.980
I'm alright!

35:12.250 --> 35:13.980
Maybe we should just call it a day.

35:14.030 --> 35:16.840
Yeah, um, OK...

35:17.010 --> 35:18.720
Alright I'm going out on a limb here,

35:18.720 --> 35:22.720
but this is not your best idea.

35:22.970 --> 35:24.190
I know.

35:24.640 --> 35:28.200
I just 'gotta learn you know, to be around Jesse

35:28.250 --> 35:30.020
without getting all you know, weak-kneed.

35:33.170 --> 35:35.470
Oh, sweet sweaty niblets!

35:35.480 --> 35:36.780
OK OK Alright, alright.

35:38.090 --> 35:40.220
Be strong. Be strong, you can do this.

35:40.580 --> 35:43.430
OK, what give, you are way too smart

35:43.430 --> 35:45.330
to come up with something this stupid.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.580
Hey! For your information

35:47.750 --> 35:49.610
you are looking at a girl stupid enough

35:49.610 --> 35:52.940
to dress up as a chicken, a duck, a swan...

35:52.980 --> 35:54.600
A pirate, a carrot.

35:54.700 --> 35:56.560
Oh, and once, at Make-a-Moose,

35:56.560 --> 35:58.420
she had an explosion in her pants.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.160
It's not what it sounds like.

36:01.990 --> 36:04.690
Look, my point is, I am completely stupid.

36:05.970 --> 36:08.500
Fine, if you don't want to tell me what's going on,

36:08.500 --> 36:09.310
I'm outta here.

36:10.100 --> 36:12.020
No, Jesse, please.

36:14.790 --> 36:16.090
It's honesty time.

36:18.020 --> 36:19.390
-Lola?  -Yeah.

36:20.900 --> 36:22.070
It's honesty time.

36:23.310 --> 36:24.280
Yeah.

36:25.420 --> 36:26.410
Go!

36:28.050 --> 36:29.670
Fine, I'll go to the bathroom...

36:33.890 --> 36:35.340
I'm attracted to you, OK!

36:38.290 --> 36:39.360
Really?

36:39.450 --> 36:41.760
Yes, but I'm not going to do anything about it.

36:43.150 --> 36:44.160
Really?

36:45.120 --> 36:46.030
Really.

36:46.150 --> 36:51.410
Because, you know... I have someone, that's caring, and loyal

36:51.420 --> 36:52.710
and is always going to be there for me.

36:53.050 --> 36:55.800
Are you dating a guy, or a golden retriever?

36:56.040 --> 37:00.710
Stop it! Look, the point is that I love Jake.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.960
And, I'm not going to ruin that

37:02.960 --> 37:04.780
just because of some smooth-talking,

37:04.990 --> 37:08.180
good looking and tense bruting,

37:09.780 --> 37:14.530
sweetie. Strong, yet sensitive guy who...

37:15.480 --> 37:16.650
Do me a favor.

37:18.580 --> 37:19.760
Put this on for me.

37:21.410 --> 37:22.250
There.

37:22.580 --> 37:23.720
You're a heartbreaker,

37:23.720 --> 37:28.330
and I just, I just can't be with someone like that.

37:28.420 --> 37:29.940
-Wait a min...  -Hey.

37:29.980 --> 37:31.790
I saw you dump that girl the other day.

37:33.150 --> 37:34.360
Just what I thought.

37:36.830 --> 37:38.520
I dumped her because I met you.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.420
How many times have you used that one before?

37:45.790 --> 37:47.710
OK... a lot.

37:49.130 --> 37:50.280
But this time I mean it.

37:51.470 --> 37:52.790
It's different with you,

37:53.320 --> 37:54.680
I can't get you out of my head.

37:55.810 --> 38:01.570
Your laugh... the way you lose yourself in a song...

38:02.260 --> 38:03.800
the way you love life...

38:06.970 --> 38:08.720
Just say no if you want me to stop.

38:09.790 --> 38:12.110
No! No! No!

38:12.570 --> 38:14.540
See, I can't do this because, argh,

38:15.000 --> 38:16.400
I mean, I wanna kiss you.

38:17.710 --> 38:21.110
You have no idea how much I want to kiss you.

38:22.250 --> 38:24.120
Boy, do I want to kiss you!

38:24.350 --> 38:25.630
You wanna what?

38:27.040 --> 38:28.800
Jakey!

38:28.970 --> 38:30.550
I was just writing a song for you,

38:30.560 --> 38:32.250
You have no idea how much I want to kiss you.

38:32.280 --> 38:35.070
My Jakey wakey baby, yeah yeah yeah let's go!

38:35.430 --> 38:36.580
Isn't that right Jesse?

38:37.170 --> 38:38.240
What?

38:38.270 --> 38:40.190
Yeah... I don't believe it either.

38:40.210 --> 38:41.630
Look Jake, nothing happened

38:41.630 --> 38:42.740
and nothing was going to happen.

38:42.770 --> 38:43.600
She wanted it to.

38:43.880 --> 38:45.640
One problem at a time, please.

38:46.000 --> 38:48.300
Look, you know how I feel about you Jake.

38:48.310 --> 38:49.270
I thought I did!

38:49.360 --> 38:51.120
Now, I'm not so sure.

38:51.420 --> 38:53.090
When you figure it out, let me know.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.270
Me too.

38:57.470 --> 39:01.280
But for what it was worth, I wanted to kiss you too.

39:05.620 --> 39:06.790
Whoaw.

39:07.500 --> 39:09.740
Go to the bathroom, you just miss everything.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.130
Hey Miles, we got here as fast as we could.

39:20.130 --> 39:21.490
Yeah, we would've been here sooner,

39:21.500 --> 39:23.590
but somebody thought code red meant

39:23.590 --> 39:26.030
stop and get frozen yoghurt on the way to Miley's!

39:26.630 --> 39:27.980
Oh, that's funny.

39:27.980 --> 39:29.430
I don't remember this bothering you

39:29.430 --> 39:30.770
when you were eating most of it!

39:30.770 --> 39:31.650
Hey.

39:32.530 --> 39:34.950
Oh. How selfish am I.

39:35.240 --> 39:38.940
I mean, my life is practically falling apart, but argh...

39:38.980 --> 39:41.760
I'm interrupting a yoghurt crisis!

39:42.510 --> 39:43.980
Sorry, OK. We're here for you.

39:44.250 --> 39:46.140
OK, so argh...so what's the deal?

39:46.470 --> 39:47.290
Both of these guys are

39:47.290 --> 39:48.770
just waiting for you to make up your mind?

39:49.100 --> 39:50.030
Yeah.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.860
Man. I 'gotta tell you Miley,

39:52.900 --> 39:55.080
if I found out that Lily was torn between me and another guy,

39:55.080 --> 39:57.440
I would walk right up to her, and I would say...

39:57.440 --> 39:58.090
What?

39:58.310 --> 39:59.900
You would say what?

40:00.840 --> 40:02.420
...You take all the time you need, sweetheart,

40:02.430 --> 40:03.530
I am here for you and only you,

40:03.600 --> 40:04.900
would you like a foot massage?

40:05.090 --> 40:08.740
Oh. See, this is why I love you.

40:08.790 --> 40:10.530
And why you would even think

40:10.530 --> 40:11.820
I would even look at another guy,

40:11.850 --> 40:14.030
because I am a one-guy kind of girl.

40:14.110 --> 40:17.350
I don't go buzzing around like some little Queen diva who...

40:17.350 --> 40:19.850
One little pretty flower, next pretty flower

40:19.890 --> 40:21.010
But that's just me!

40:21.210 --> 40:23.540
You know, I don't make any judgements.

40:23.670 --> 40:25.720
Oh, look at the time, we're late!

40:27.490 --> 40:29.180
Late for what, we just got here.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.450
-We're just late, OK!  -OK!

40:32.450 --> 40:35.320
You know, whatever choice you make, it's gonna be OK.

40:36.450 --> 40:38.190
Let's face it, they're both gorgeous.

40:38.200 --> 40:38.980
What!

40:39.000 --> 40:42.500
In a way that's totally unattractive to me personally,

40:42.510 --> 40:45.050
because to me, it's not about the looks.

40:45.570 --> 40:46.520
Excuse me?

40:47.800 --> 40:51.520
Which is why your rigid good looks are just icing on the cake!

40:51.680 --> 40:52.640
-You're darn right, there.  -Yeah!

40:56.280 --> 40:58.170
Man, this is just so hard.

40:58.550 --> 41:01.940
I mean, you... we have so much history.

41:02.350 --> 41:04.980
I mean, I loved you, and then I couldn't stand you,

41:05.050 --> 41:08.040
then I loved you, then I couldn't stand you again, and

41:08.380 --> 41:10.150
then you did the whole 'Gotcha' thing

41:10.150 --> 41:12.060
and then then we kissed and...

41:12.070 --> 41:13.280
argh!

41:13.930 --> 41:18.280
And you. I mean, Jesse, we have no history.

41:18.560 --> 41:22.830
But when we were writing that song... something just clicked.

41:23.180 --> 41:26.120
And then you said all those incredibly sweet things and

41:26.240 --> 41:30.000
then we almost kissed, which brings me back to... argh!

41:30.420 --> 41:32.270
Why do you have to be so wonderful!

41:32.570 --> 41:34.980
Why can't you guys just do the honorable thing and stink!

41:36.010 --> 41:37.720
Hey, watch it!

41:38.560 --> 41:40.840
What do you see in this guy anyway?

41:41.190 --> 41:44.870
Oh, real macho movie star are you,

41:44.870 --> 41:46.600
not to fight not to fight

41:49.830 --> 41:52.000
Come on, I know you had a thing with him

41:52.000 --> 41:54.200
but that doesn't mean you have to stay with him out of guilt.

41:54.390 --> 41:57.160
Guilt? She loves me!

41:57.170 --> 41:58.500
-Oh.  -Not you.

41:58.570 --> 42:01.460
I think you mean loved.

42:01.480 --> 42:03.610
As in, the past.

42:03.700 --> 42:07.310
As in, that was then, and this is Jesse-time.

42:07.870 --> 42:10.520
-Jake time.  -Jesse time!

42:10.680 --> 42:11.980
-Jake!  -Jesse!

42:12.710 --> 42:14.130
-Jake!  -Jesse!

42:15.060 --> 42:16.120
-Jake!  -Jesse!

42:16.200 --> 42:17.850
Stop it! Arghh!!!

42:20.040 --> 42:21.170
You OK?

42:22.780 --> 42:25.370
Daddy. I'm yelling at pictures.

42:25.390 --> 42:27.160
Does this seem normal to you?

42:27.170 --> 42:28.450
Mile, in this family

42:28.450 --> 42:30.700
I stopped expecting normal a long time ago.

42:30.950 --> 42:31.850
What's going on?

42:32.040 --> 42:33.670
Well, remember Jesse?

42:33.980 --> 42:35.320
The one that I pretended to like

42:35.320 --> 42:36.670
so maybe you'd like Jake a little better?

42:36.840 --> 42:38.550
-Oh, no.  -Oh yeah.

42:38.740 --> 42:40.140
So you don't like Jake anymore?

42:40.220 --> 42:41.330
Didn't say that!

42:41.330 --> 42:42.670
-Oh, no.  -Oh yeah.

42:42.670 --> 42:45.220
-Oh, boy.  -Actually, oh boys.

42:46.470 --> 42:48.800
Oh, well.

42:51.290 --> 42:52.820
Sounds like you got yourself into

42:52.820 --> 42:54.360
a pretty tough situation here.

42:54.580 --> 42:55.980
I really feel for you.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.210
Oh, but it's clear to me there's only one thing you can do.

43:00.720 --> 43:04.190
Dump 'em both, and buy shoes. Two pair, I'll pay, your choice.

43:05.730 --> 43:06.690
Daddy.

43:07.060 --> 43:08.520
OK. Three pair,

43:08.520 --> 43:10.330
and I'll go with Italian not even blink an eye

43:11.000 --> 43:13.700
Dad, you are no help at all. No guy is!

43:13.880 --> 43:16.610
The only thing you are good for is opening jars, changing tires

43:16.620 --> 43:18.080
and going downstairs with a baseball bat

43:18.080 --> 43:19.380
when we think we hear something.

43:24.300 --> 43:27.950
Men are useless, yes it's true.

43:27.960 --> 43:31.410
I'm a man, and so are you.

43:31.550 --> 43:34.940
Don't ask us stuff, 'cause we're always wrong.

43:35.120 --> 43:38.720
We don't even know how to end this song.

43:41.190 --> 43:46.470
La la la la la la la la

43:53.700 --> 43:58.130
Dad. You can show me as many pictures of shoes as you want,

43:58.320 --> 43:59.790
but it's not going to change anything.

44:00.330 --> 44:02.260
But bookmark the page for when I'm feeling better.

44:03.270 --> 44:04.130
Now Mile,

44:04.130 --> 44:07.100
I know I'm not much good when it comes to this kind of thing,

44:07.310 --> 44:09.510
but I think I know someone who is.

44:10.030 --> 44:11.250
Oh no.

44:11.330 --> 44:12.710
Dad, you're not going to show me

44:12.710 --> 44:13.810
that Gilligan's Island episode

44:13.820 --> 44:15.990
where he has to choose between Ginger and Mary-Anne

44:16.000 --> 44:17.430
and ends up loosing the both of them.

44:17.440 --> 44:19.280
Yeah, and the banana raft.

44:19.320 --> 44:20.580
I thought for sure it was going to

44:20.580 --> 44:21.990
get them off the island that time.

44:22.980 --> 44:27.450
But don't worry, I am positive you have not seen this before.

44:28.660 --> 44:30.020
Just click on play.

44:35.020 --> 44:36.290
Hey, baby girl.

44:36.580 --> 44:37.520
Mom?

44:37.860 --> 44:39.270
Well, if you're watching this,

44:39.270 --> 44:40.540
it means you've reached an age

44:40.540 --> 44:42.080
where you're having boy troubles,

44:42.110 --> 44:43.670
and your daddy's only solution is

44:43.670 --> 44:47.160
to bring out one of those goofy Gilligan Island episodes.

44:47.480 --> 44:51.460
Hey, the Gilligan messages are about the option deals a lot

44:53.540 --> 44:54.470
Blue Jeans' right,

44:54.470 --> 44:57.090
he says would you just hush up and hold the camera?

44:57.830 --> 44:58.760
Come here.

44:59.370 --> 45:03.060
Now, honey, you're probably wishing I was there to help you.

45:03.730 --> 45:05.220
But the truth is, even if I was,

45:05.220 --> 45:07.890
I'd be telling you exactly what I am telling you now.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.550
The only voice that really matters, is the one inside you.

45:13.310 --> 45:15.170
It's easier than you think.

45:17.240 --> 45:18.890
And if you listen to your heart,

45:18.890 --> 45:20.690
an answer will always come to you.

45:21.850 --> 45:24.960
It's gonna be OK, sweet pea. I love you.

45:25.400 --> 45:26.830
I love you too.

45:28.730 --> 45:31.530
Alright. OK,

45:35.580 --> 45:39.280
OK, heart. I'm listening, let's hear the answer.

45:42.330 --> 45:43.630
Still listening.

45:45.600 --> 45:48.520
Don't be shy. Just you and me here!

45:51.960 --> 45:52.910
...Jake.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.250
Well I guess that this means...

45:57.820 --> 46:00.550
Jesse? Oh, mud crunkies!

46:02.000 --> 46:03.770
Hi, I can't get to the phone right now,

46:03.780 --> 46:05.560
but I really, really want to hear what you have to say.

46:05.610 --> 46:06.770
Please leave me a message.

46:06.970 --> 46:08.650
And I don't care what links,

46:08.650 --> 46:10.470
because I really, really want to hear what you have to say.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.160
Beep!

46:12.480 --> 46:16.540
Hey, it's me. I just wanted to say that...

46:16.550 --> 46:17.790
I feel kinda bad about...

46:17.790 --> 46:19.180
Putting you on the spot like that.

46:19.750 --> 46:21.040
The bottom line is...

46:21.300 --> 46:22.690
No matter what you decide...

46:22.920 --> 46:24.700
I just want you to be happy.

46:26.880 --> 46:27.950
Arghh!

46:28.060 --> 46:30.340
Two boys that just want me to be happy?

46:30.530 --> 46:32.790
You didn't see that one coming, did you mom?

46:41.000 --> 46:42.850
I thought you said it was easy...

46:43.550 --> 46:45.050
"listening to your heart".

46:45.200 --> 46:50.230
I thought you said it was easy,

46:50.490 --> 46:55.610
listening to your heart

46:55.950 --> 47:01.120
I thought you said I'd be ok

47:01.310 --> 47:05.140
So why am I breaking apart?

47:05.140 --> 47:06.570
Don't wanna be torn

47:06.600 --> 47:09.410
Why is all this so confusing

47:09.430 --> 47:12.110
complicated and consuming

47:12.220 --> 47:14.830
Why did all this made me angry

47:14.830 --> 47:21.590
I want to go back to being happy

47:21.840 --> 47:23.400
(Hannah Montana - Don't Wanna Be Torn)

47:24.390 --> 47:25.460
Whoaw.

47:27.110 --> 47:28.390
So it's not me.

47:30.420 --> 47:34.080
It's just... when your picture landed in front of me,

47:34.950 --> 47:35.900
I...

47:36.000 --> 47:37.160
You were disappointed.

47:37.910 --> 47:39.790
I'm sorry, Jesse...

47:39.800 --> 47:42.180
there's just something between Jake and me.

47:44.630 --> 47:47.760
Well like I said, he's a lucky guy.

47:54.000 --> 47:55.720
Go on. It's OK.

47:56.790 --> 47:57.530
Thanks.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.140
Miley, Miley!

48:13.160 --> 48:16.060
I got your message, so is it me, or...

48:16.090 --> 48:18.950
Jake!!

48:20.580 --> 48:24.740
She was in love with both guys!

48:24.750 --> 48:26.450
But she had to choose.

48:26.460 --> 48:28.410
Which meant the other would lose.

48:28.410 --> 48:32.350
She was in love with both guys!

48:32.350 --> 48:34.200
Then she listened to her heart

48:34.200 --> 48:37.280
and now you know it helped her choose the right guy.

48:40.580 --> 48:44.540
He's got something special, He's got something special

48:44.650 --> 48:48.370
And when he's looking at me I wanna get all sentimental

48:48.590 --> 48:52.220
He's got something special, He's got something special

48:52.300 --> 48:54.260
I can hardly breathe, something telling me,

48:54.290 --> 48:56.980
telling me maybe he could be the one

48:57.120 --> 49:02.750
he could be the one. he could be the one.

49:02.890 --> 49:06.530
he could be the one. he could be the one.

49:06.600 --> 49:09.610
he could be the one.

49:09.620 --> 49:10.360
You sure?

49:11.400 --> 49:15.380
he could be the one.

49:15.500 --> 49:17.180
