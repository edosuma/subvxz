WEBVTT

00:02.386 --> 00:05.254
- She was taken to a party.
- Drugged, raped...

00:05.256 --> 00:07.056
Police?
Some.

00:08.491 --> 00:10.993
Weird shit has been happening
since my aunt died.

00:10.995 --> 00:12.061
Is someone following you?

00:12.063 --> 00:13.562
All the time.

00:13.564 --> 00:15.264
The person you
need to talk to

00:15.266 --> 00:16.765
Is chuchito.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.500
Hello? Chuchito?

00:21.271 --> 00:22.771
Captain robles
sent me here

00:22.773 --> 00:23.773
To work the case.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.407
That's all we got.

00:25.409 --> 00:26.275
Who else was
in the car?

00:26.277 --> 00:27.576
He crossed with a woman.

00:27.578 --> 00:29.411
Kind of strange-looking.

00:29.413 --> 00:32.414
You want me to get
some guys together?
No.

00:32.415 --> 00:34.617
I want to let the local cops
chase her.

00:34.619 --> 00:36.585
Have you been
with a woman before?

00:36.587 --> 00:37.587
No.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.614
Need some help?

01:05.616 --> 01:08.050
Uh... Are all
these things on sale?

01:08.052 --> 01:09.052
Yeah.

01:09.053 --> 01:10.653
Buy one, get
one half off.

01:10.655 --> 01:13.455
I would like to try
them on, please.

01:13.457 --> 01:14.890
You betcha.

01:20.930 --> 01:22.631
You'll have to leave
the bag out here.

01:22.633 --> 01:24.500
Store policy.

01:26.469 --> 01:28.437
I'm not going to steal anything.

01:28.439 --> 01:29.738
I promise.

01:33.343 --> 01:34.677
I guess it's okay.

01:34.679 --> 01:36.478
I'll be right
out here

01:36.480 --> 01:39.448
If you need another
size or anything.

01:39.450 --> 01:41.684
No.

01:41.686 --> 01:44.153
I prefer to be by myself,
if that's okay.

03:56.386 --> 03:58.054
What?

03:58.056 --> 04:01.390
That wasn't as good
as the first time.

04:01.392 --> 04:02.892
For me, I mean.

04:05.729 --> 04:07.063
You always, uh...

04:07.065 --> 04:09.031
Are you always
this honest?

04:09.033 --> 04:11.100
Should I lie?

04:14.005 --> 04:15.872
Um... No.

04:15.874 --> 04:17.940
No, you shouldn't.

04:20.410 --> 04:22.545
Don't worry.

04:22.547 --> 04:24.547
It will be better next time.

04:26.718 --> 04:28.918
Sure.

04:31.889 --> 04:33.055
<i>All right, then,
well, you're official.</i>

04:33.057 --> 04:35.057
<i>Gracias.</i>

04:35.059 --> 04:36.993
Just going to wait around
for the lieutenant?

04:36.995 --> 04:39.061
Got nothing
better to do.

04:39.063 --> 04:40.730
Okay. Well, if you don't
have a place to stay,

04:40.732 --> 04:42.932
I got one of those
air mattress thingies.

04:42.934 --> 04:44.567
Thank you.

04:44.569 --> 04:45.868
Thanks.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.069
I-I'm fine.

04:47.071 --> 04:49.872
All right.
Well, if you change your mind,

04:49.874 --> 04:51.440
I make a mean omelet.

04:51.442 --> 04:53.075
I'm sure you do.

04:54.913 --> 04:56.045
Take care, kitty.

04:56.047 --> 04:58.447
You, too.

04:58.449 --> 04:59.548
Good night,
lieutenant.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.919
Good night,
miss kitty.

05:02.921 --> 05:04.453
Marco ruiz.

05:04.455 --> 05:05.755
Hey, hank.

05:07.124 --> 05:09.091
Welcome back.
Good to
see you.

05:09.093 --> 05:10.693
How you been?

05:10.695 --> 05:13.696
I've been okay. You know...

05:13.698 --> 05:15.097
You going back across tonight?

05:15.099 --> 05:17.466
No, I don't think so.

05:17.468 --> 05:20.036
Well, then, I've got
some fancy rye whiskey

05:20.038 --> 05:22.471
I would like to
dip into. Come on.

05:24.042 --> 05:26.122
Sonya tells me you're having
some trouble down there.

05:28.111 --> 05:30.012
One of my own men
tried to kill me.

05:32.749 --> 05:35.551
This thing with eva...

05:35.553 --> 05:37.486
She someplace
safe?

05:37.488 --> 05:38.788
For now.

05:38.790 --> 05:40.122
Good.

05:40.124 --> 05:41.090
Hey, you want to go see her?

05:41.092 --> 05:42.491
I can arrange that.

05:42.493 --> 05:45.094
I'd rather not.

05:45.096 --> 05:46.963
They have men watching me.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.969
Sent a prosecutor out
from mexico city.

05:52.971 --> 05:54.870
He's been asking questions.

05:55.973 --> 05:59.008
Well, until things cool down
down there, I...

05:59.010 --> 06:01.110
I could use you on this case.

06:01.112 --> 06:03.779
Dea's all
over it,

06:03.781 --> 06:06.849
Cartel implications,
you know the drill.

06:06.851 --> 06:09.819
We could use your
perspective on things.

06:11.188 --> 06:12.822
Of course.

06:12.824 --> 06:14.824
I'll see what I can do.

06:14.826 --> 06:15.992
And if you
want me to cover

06:15.994 --> 06:18.828
For you with robles,
you just say the word.

06:21.098 --> 06:22.164
<i>Gracias, hank.</i>

06:29.673 --> 06:31.173
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I wasn't finished with that!

06:31.175 --> 06:32.608
Hey, hold the wheel.

06:32.610 --> 06:34.010
I gotta drain
rayray.

06:34.012 --> 06:36.145
Oh, come on,
man...
What?

06:36.147 --> 06:38.781
<i>A man's gotta go
when a man's gotta go.</i>

06:38.783 --> 06:40.016
Sick pig.

06:40.018 --> 06:41.650
One of these days,

06:41.652 --> 06:43.786
I'm gonna learn how to
speak mexican, cesar.

06:43.788 --> 06:45.187
<i>The wheel,
compadre.</i>

06:51.895 --> 06:53.796
Holy...
Did you see that?

06:53.798 --> 06:54.864
Watch it,
watch it, watch it!

06:54.866 --> 06:56.232
What the hell?

07:03.207 --> 07:05.141
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Okay, okay!

07:12.016 --> 07:13.649
Keys. Phone.

07:13.651 --> 07:16.052
Shit, man, okay, okay.
Okay.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.588
All right.

07:19.590 --> 07:20.723
Relax.

07:20.725 --> 07:21.857
We're just here
for the dope, okay?

07:21.859 --> 07:23.659
<i>No comprende.</i>

07:25.595 --> 07:26.896
We do him first, then you.
All right?

07:26.898 --> 07:27.898
The dope...

07:27.899 --> 07:30.199
It's not yours.

07:30.201 --> 07:31.901
Why die for it?

07:33.603 --> 07:35.171
It's in the back.

07:43.213 --> 07:47.049
<i>Nada.</i>

07:52.856 --> 07:54.290
Where is it?

07:54.292 --> 07:55.991
Eat shit, paco.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.262
Where is it?

08:01.932 --> 08:04.266
It's in the horse.

08:06.269 --> 08:07.269
Up its ass.

08:09.106 --> 08:10.106
What?

08:10.108 --> 08:11.707
Ask him.

08:11.709 --> 08:13.342
It was his idea.

08:19.283 --> 08:21.317
Oh.

08:21.319 --> 08:22.319
Oh...

08:22.320 --> 08:24.153
Sorry 'bout that, vickers.

08:28.291 --> 08:30.126
Ugh!

08:35.131 --> 08:37.198
Ugh...

08:40.003 --> 08:41.169
There.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.176
Now what?

08:53.150 --> 08:54.283
Okay.

08:54.285 --> 08:57.219
If you're going to do it,
do it!

09:00.157 --> 09:02.358
I'm not gonna shoot you.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.163
I'll leave that
up to fausto galvan.

09:07.165 --> 09:09.298
<i>Adios,
amigos.</i>

09:09.300 --> 09:11.167
Get that shit.

09:25.316 --> 09:26.715
Ray?

09:26.717 --> 09:28.350
Oh. Where have
you been?

09:28.352 --> 09:29.852
Well, didn't you get my text?

09:29.854 --> 09:31.954
I fell off my horse.
I broke my wrist.

09:31.956 --> 09:33.222
We got hit.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.356
What?

09:34.358 --> 09:35.191
Hit, hit.

09:35.193 --> 09:36.325
You know.

09:36.327 --> 09:37.993
Are you okay?

09:37.995 --> 09:38.995
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:38.996 --> 09:40.996
Vickers ain't
so good, though.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.231
What happened?

09:42.233 --> 09:44.366
Char, we can't talk
about this on the phone.

09:44.368 --> 09:45.368
<i>¿comprendo?</i>

09:45.369 --> 09:47.002
Uh-huh.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.370
All right.
Pack a bag and hang tight.

09:48.372 --> 09:51.207
Remember the plan.

09:58.215 --> 09:59.215
Hey.

09:59.217 --> 10:00.217
Hey.

10:00.218 --> 10:01.218
What's up?

10:01.219 --> 10:03.352
The kid.

10:03.354 --> 10:05.254
Just came in with his mom.

10:05.256 --> 10:07.389
He says he saw a woman
that fits our description.

10:07.391 --> 10:10.192
When?
That night.

10:10.194 --> 10:12.194
Washing blood off herself.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.263
About a mile
from the crime scene.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.831
Have you talked to him yet?

10:15.833 --> 10:17.199
I'm just going in.

10:17.201 --> 10:18.400
Can I sit in?

10:18.402 --> 10:19.501
Of course.

10:22.339 --> 10:24.406
Focus, dex.

10:26.776 --> 10:28.911
Good.

10:28.913 --> 10:30.379
Is this her?

10:30.381 --> 10:33.415
Yeah.

10:33.417 --> 10:36.352
But you said
she was naked, right?

10:36.354 --> 10:38.120
Yeah.

10:38.122 --> 10:40.089
She had tattoos

10:40.091 --> 10:43.225
Like aunt molly
has on her back.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.860
What kind of tattoos?

10:44.862 --> 10:47.429
Scary.

10:47.431 --> 10:49.265
I-I didn't get very close.

10:49.267 --> 10:52.101
She came toward us and I ran.

10:52.103 --> 10:53.402
Kyle stayed, though.

10:53.404 --> 10:55.537
That's your friend?

10:57.307 --> 10:58.440
Why didn't he run?

10:58.442 --> 11:02.244
'cause she was naked, I guess.

11:02.246 --> 11:06.415
And do you know where
your friend is right now?

11:06.417 --> 11:08.884
That's the thing.
I don't.

11:08.886 --> 11:10.886
He didn't show up at school

11:10.888 --> 11:12.054
And he isn't texting me back.

11:12.056 --> 11:14.390
What did this woman do?

11:14.392 --> 11:15.424
That is what we're

11:15.426 --> 11:17.459
Trying to find out, ma'am.

11:17.461 --> 11:19.461
Have you told
anybody else about this?

11:19.463 --> 11:23.332
I brought him right here
as soon as I heard this.

11:25.468 --> 11:28.270
Do you think
kyle's gonna be okay?

11:28.272 --> 11:31.473
Well, we don't know.

11:31.475 --> 11:34.076
I should've stayed.

11:34.078 --> 11:35.277
No, no, no, no.

11:35.279 --> 11:37.079
You did the right thing.

11:37.081 --> 11:39.315
We'll find him.

11:39.317 --> 11:42.384
Oh, it's okay.

11:46.523 --> 11:47.990
<i>He didn't go to school.</i>

11:47.992 --> 11:49.491
And the car?

11:49.493 --> 11:51.493
Uh, minivan.

11:51.495 --> 11:54.663
I mean, we would let him use it,
but only with one of us.

11:54.665 --> 11:57.099
He knows better.

11:57.101 --> 11:58.967
Is anything else missing?

11:58.969 --> 12:02.338
Just some of my wife's clothes.

12:03.506 --> 12:06.608
What else?

12:06.610 --> 12:09.111
Left the milk
and the bread out.

12:09.113 --> 12:11.113
But that's normal
operating procedure for him

12:11.115 --> 12:12.481
When he comes home late.

12:12.483 --> 12:15.384
He didn't have a curfew?

12:15.386 --> 12:18.887
We tried, but he would
sneak out with his friends.

12:18.889 --> 12:20.189
Do you have kids?

12:20.191 --> 12:21.191
Uh, no.

12:21.192 --> 12:24.526
Children do better with curfews.

12:24.528 --> 12:26.195
How is this helping

12:26.197 --> 12:28.263
To get our son back?

12:32.135 --> 12:33.502
These are very cool.

12:33.504 --> 12:35.871
Thanks.

12:37.207 --> 12:40.909
I know many of these people
already asked you, but...

12:40.911 --> 12:43.746
Just between you and me...

12:43.748 --> 12:45.981
You see anything

12:45.983 --> 12:48.550
The morning your brother left?

12:48.552 --> 12:51.553
Someone took
my metamorphosis card.

12:51.555 --> 12:55.157
What's a "metamorphosis card"?

12:55.159 --> 12:57.226
I'll show you.

13:45.576 --> 13:48.076
- Hey, señora?
- Señora!

13:49.914 --> 13:53.582
<i>No gracias.</i>

13:53.584 --> 13:55.784
Oh, not him.
Why you want him?

13:55.786 --> 13:57.619
He had an accident.

13:57.621 --> 13:58.887
He's not right.

14:02.225 --> 14:03.659
What is your name?

14:04.594 --> 14:07.229
Jaime.

14:07.231 --> 14:10.899
Do you want a job, jaime?

14:16.473 --> 14:19.208
Okay.

14:25.648 --> 14:27.649
You work for me?

14:27.651 --> 14:29.885
You walk faster.

14:34.257 --> 14:37.025
Any idea how the boy
figures into this?

14:37.027 --> 14:39.161
Oh, she's using him.

14:39.163 --> 14:41.630
She got a car, clothes.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.532
Who knows what else?

14:43.534 --> 14:45.701
That's all?
So far.

14:45.703 --> 14:48.837
We have reasons to believe
that he's still with her.

14:48.839 --> 14:50.772
Hmm.

14:50.774 --> 14:53.175
Could be some kind
of sex thing.

14:54.544 --> 14:56.512
You said she has tattoos, right?

14:56.514 --> 14:57.980
I don't follow you.

14:57.982 --> 15:00.716
Women with tattoos,
statistically speaking,

15:00.718 --> 15:02.417
Are more sexually
adventurous.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.858
Why don't you tell us

15:09.860 --> 15:12.661
How she fits into the cartel?

15:12.663 --> 15:15.130
She's not a girlfriend.

15:16.866 --> 15:19.067
There's been some chatter
about a woman working

15:19.069 --> 15:20.903
In the fausto galvan operation.

15:20.905 --> 15:24.006
Unsubstantiated chatter,
mind you, but they say that

15:24.008 --> 15:25.307
She is a mennonite.

15:25.309 --> 15:26.675
You're serious?

15:26.677 --> 15:27.809
Shunned mennonite.

15:27.811 --> 15:29.811
Normally cartels
don't employ women

15:29.813 --> 15:30.979
In the upper levels.

15:30.981 --> 15:33.882
It sounds like they've
made an exception.

15:33.884 --> 15:37.019
So, what makes
this woman so special?

15:37.021 --> 15:40.155
I'm not at liberty to say.

15:41.324 --> 15:42.891
We share, you share.

15:42.893 --> 15:45.093
That deal only extends
to our partners

15:45.095 --> 15:46.895
Here in the el paso
police department.

15:46.897 --> 15:49.831
Detective ruiz is a member

15:49.833 --> 15:51.099
Of our team.

15:51.101 --> 15:52.768
With all due respect,
lieutenant,

15:52.770 --> 15:54.770
You might've found

15:54.772 --> 15:57.406
Jimmy tecca's body
buried under beetles

15:57.408 --> 16:01.009
Here in el paso,
but he was murdered in juárez.

16:01.011 --> 16:03.946
And we have our reasons
for not trusting

16:03.948 --> 16:05.347
The mexican police.

16:06.784 --> 16:08.784
What's up?

16:08.786 --> 16:11.119
A feller at mine key storage
up on dakota ridge

16:11.121 --> 16:12.354
I.D.'d yovani garza

16:12.356 --> 16:13.622
Coming in three days ago.

16:13.624 --> 16:14.923
He was with a woman.

16:14.925 --> 16:16.124
Let's go see this.

16:16.126 --> 16:17.192
Hey there, joe?

16:17.194 --> 16:19.127
You got a minute?

16:19.129 --> 16:20.796
What's on your mind, hank?

16:20.798 --> 16:23.932
Okay, and what else are
you not sharing with me?

16:23.934 --> 16:26.935
Her name is eleanor nacht.

16:26.937 --> 16:28.937
One of fausto's money people.

16:28.939 --> 16:31.139
We grab her,
we have a legitimate shot

16:31.141 --> 16:32.975
At bringing down
fausto galvan.

16:32.977 --> 16:34.977
Do the world a favor.

16:34.979 --> 16:36.378
Not really.

16:36.380 --> 16:37.646
He exists

16:37.648 --> 16:39.081
Because higher-ups on both sides

16:39.083 --> 16:41.750
Of the border let him exist.

16:41.752 --> 16:43.385
Yeah, copy that.

16:43.387 --> 16:44.387
Mm-hmm.

16:44.388 --> 16:45.654
All I ask is

16:45.656 --> 16:47.456
That you manage your people

16:47.458 --> 16:49.625
And keep the big picture
in mind.

16:49.627 --> 16:51.660
"the big picture."

16:51.662 --> 16:53.428
Mm-hmm.

16:53.430 --> 16:55.497
Okay.

17:07.977 --> 17:10.045
This is it, right?

17:13.816 --> 17:15.916
Please be alive.

17:15.919 --> 17:17.185
Aw.

17:17.186 --> 17:18.787
I was kind of hoping
you'd be all dressed up.

17:18.789 --> 17:20.122
Were you followed?

17:20.124 --> 17:22.424
Uh, no.

17:22.425 --> 17:24.192
<i>But we did find your bonboncito.</i>

17:24.194 --> 17:25.560
You want to let us in?

17:32.035 --> 17:34.102
I knew it.

17:41.811 --> 17:44.713
What did they do to him?

17:44.715 --> 17:47.716
It was bad.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.885
They stuffed him
into a duffel bag.

17:49.887 --> 17:51.953
Oh, my god.

17:54.524 --> 17:58.026
Look, I don't want
to be an asshole

17:58.028 --> 17:59.828
Or whatever, but if you know
who killed chuchito,

17:59.830 --> 18:02.030
You got to tell us, man.

18:02.032 --> 18:03.799
Was it the cartel?

18:05.134 --> 18:08.336
He had another job
with the cartel.

18:08.338 --> 18:11.907
Setting up
a new money house.

18:11.909 --> 18:13.542
I saw him
with the woman in charge.

18:16.145 --> 18:18.513
I don't understand.
Why would they kill him?

18:18.515 --> 18:21.917
It's the cartel.
It's just how they do business.

18:21.919 --> 18:25.087
It wasn't them.

18:25.089 --> 18:26.555
Then who was it?

18:26.557 --> 18:29.725
I don't know.

18:29.727 --> 18:33.995
But they'll be
following you now.

18:33.997 --> 18:36.798
Have fun with that.

18:48.512 --> 18:51.413
Has marco found her yet?

18:51.415 --> 18:52.948
No.

18:52.950 --> 18:55.217
They think she took a kid.

18:55.219 --> 18:56.284
Why do they say that?

18:56.286 --> 18:58.086
What do I know?

18:58.088 --> 19:01.523
Maybe she likes kids.

19:01.525 --> 19:03.225
I lost a load.

19:03.227 --> 19:05.193
Cost of doing business.

19:07.296 --> 19:10.098
Don't tell me
how to handle my business.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.200
I didn't know.

19:12.202 --> 19:14.202
When did it happen?

19:14.204 --> 19:15.904
Last night.

19:15.906 --> 19:17.205
In el paso.

19:17.207 --> 19:20.942
It was a small load.

19:20.944 --> 19:23.311
Punk kids from juárez.

19:23.313 --> 19:25.247
The bellagua neighborhood.

19:25.249 --> 19:26.615
Do you want me
to take care of it?

19:26.617 --> 19:28.650
No.

19:33.389 --> 19:35.791
I'll make my point.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.563
Maybe your men should stay away

19:41.565 --> 19:43.965
From the bellagua neighborhood
for the next few days.

19:43.967 --> 19:47.202
Okay. I'll make sure of it.

19:49.005 --> 19:50.238
The prosecutor?

19:51.975 --> 19:55.010
Boy sent to do a man's job.

19:55.012 --> 19:56.912
I'll take care of him.

19:59.849 --> 20:01.917
Good.

20:40.991 --> 20:43.291
Sorry. I didn't know
you were here.

20:43.293 --> 20:44.960
Well, keep looking.

20:52.069 --> 20:54.069
What about this?

20:54.071 --> 20:55.403
How much for this?

20:59.209 --> 21:01.743
Who is this going to be for?

21:03.079 --> 21:06.414
Just... A girl.

21:06.416 --> 21:08.083
I'd say it's $18.

21:08.085 --> 21:10.085
Okay.

21:10.087 --> 21:11.219
Now...

21:11.221 --> 21:15.724
Would you like a rock?

21:15.726 --> 21:18.026
Well, what would I want
with a rock?

21:18.028 --> 21:20.228
Take it. You'll need it.

21:20.230 --> 21:22.530
David took

21:22.532 --> 21:26.034
That son of a bitch goliath
down with a single stone.

21:43.287 --> 21:45.687
Bob.

21:45.689 --> 21:47.722
I pretty much need
some ibuprofen right now.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.291
All right, we'll have
inez fix you up after.

21:49.293 --> 21:51.259
We got business.
What's going on?

21:51.261 --> 21:53.595
We had a security breach
in the northwest quadrant

21:53.597 --> 21:55.130
Last night.

21:55.132 --> 21:57.565
Guy got caught up
in the concertina wire

21:57.567 --> 21:59.067
Out there by the stock tank.

22:08.978 --> 22:11.112
Who is it?

22:11.114 --> 22:13.415
Mexican cop.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.784
Came looking for eva.

22:15.786 --> 22:19.721
Pretty sure he's the same guy
that went out to hank's place.

22:19.723 --> 22:22.123
What for?

22:22.125 --> 22:23.959
Well, it wasn't exactly
a social call

22:23.961 --> 22:27.662
'cause he had a knife on him.

22:29.298 --> 22:31.299
You been questioning him?

22:31.301 --> 22:34.135
He has been what you might call

22:34.137 --> 22:37.439
A little bit stoic, but...

22:37.441 --> 22:39.774
We're working around that.

22:39.776 --> 22:42.410
Isn't that right,
alejandro?

22:45.147 --> 22:47.515
<i>Hola, amigo.</i>

22:47.517 --> 22:49.517
There's no need
for spanish, steven.

22:49.519 --> 22:52.153
We're speaking
the universal language of pain.

22:53.190 --> 22:54.756
Bob...
Trying to show him the truth.

22:54.758 --> 22:57.125
Bob!

22:57.127 --> 22:59.427
You give me one minute, bob.

23:09.038 --> 23:11.106
I want to hear his story.

23:21.784 --> 23:23.852
Here.

23:33.562 --> 23:35.430
Clear.

23:47.376 --> 23:49.477
These are kyle's clothes.

24:17.607 --> 24:19.075
Miss nacht.

24:19.077 --> 24:20.242
Hello.

24:20.244 --> 24:21.944
What can I do for you?

24:21.946 --> 24:24.013
Something happened.

24:26.216 --> 24:30.186
No, no. I'm managing it.
I'm managing it.

24:35.258 --> 24:37.693
Jaime!

24:37.695 --> 24:38.994
Careful.

24:43.767 --> 24:45.768
There's one more thing
I need to take care of

24:45.770 --> 24:47.136
Before I go to juárez.

25:12.129 --> 25:14.296
I got to take this. Sorry.

25:14.298 --> 25:16.132
What's up?

25:16.933 --> 25:18.734
<i>Sí.</i>

25:18.736 --> 25:20.669
No, I can't.

25:20.671 --> 25:22.304
Things got complicated
because this woman has

25:22.306 --> 25:24.173
One of these storage units.

25:24.175 --> 25:26.308
I don't know.
I'm still here.

25:26.310 --> 25:28.677
I gotta go.

25:28.679 --> 25:30.012
Who was that?

25:30.014 --> 25:32.281
Captain robles.

25:32.283 --> 25:34.917
He wanted an update
on the case.

25:34.919 --> 25:36.185
Kyle's dead.

25:36.187 --> 25:38.254
We don't know that, sonya.

25:38.256 --> 25:39.688
If he's alive, where is he?

25:39.690 --> 25:40.990
Let's go find him.

25:52.035 --> 25:54.303
All right, we'll be by
to pick you up in five.

25:54.305 --> 25:57.206
I'm not going anywhere.

25:57.208 --> 25:59.175
Oh, dude, what are
you talking about?

25:59.177 --> 26:00.843
They knew exactly
how much dope we had,

26:00.845 --> 26:03.145
Which means
we are being set up.

26:03.147 --> 26:04.313
I'm going home.

26:04.315 --> 26:06.849
I'm gonna be with
my wife, my kids.

26:06.851 --> 26:08.717
Maybe watch a video.

26:08.719 --> 26:10.986
What kind of zen
bullshit is that?

26:10.988 --> 26:13.222
Running will only piss him off.

26:14.324 --> 26:16.959
Whatever.

26:16.961 --> 26:19.461
Good luck, ray.

26:25.335 --> 26:26.335
You get a hold of monte?

26:26.337 --> 26:27.803
No, he's not picking up.

26:27.805 --> 26:30.239
What in the hell
we pay him for?

26:30.241 --> 26:31.874
How-how did they know?

26:31.876 --> 26:33.742
Don't know.
They were waiting for us.

26:33.744 --> 26:35.010
You believe that shit?

26:35.012 --> 26:37.980
I got ripped by a bunch
of taco benders on bikes.

26:37.982 --> 26:40.049
Well, where are we gonna go?

26:40.051 --> 26:41.750
I'm thinking alaska.

26:41.752 --> 26:43.052
"alaska"?

26:43.054 --> 26:44.320
Yeah. It's cold.

26:44.322 --> 26:46.355
Mexicans don't like the cold.

26:46.357 --> 26:49.225
Look, what if there
was another option?

26:49.227 --> 26:51.260
What? Like what?

26:51.262 --> 26:52.761
Like maybe we call the police,

26:52.763 --> 26:54.230
Uh, or-or somebody like that.

26:54.232 --> 26:55.898
Maybe we make a deal.

26:55.900 --> 26:58.234
"deal"? Babe, let me
stop you right there.

26:58.236 --> 27:00.836
There is no deal, okay?

27:00.838 --> 27:02.371
We lost a load
and we survived,

27:02.373 --> 27:05.074
Which means fausto's gonna think
we had something to do with it,

27:05.076 --> 27:06.242
Which means
he's gonna ask us questions,

27:06.244 --> 27:08.911
And by "questions,"
I mean torture!

27:08.913 --> 27:10.379
All right?
Maybe something with dogs

27:10.381 --> 27:12.414
Or a tire, gasoline...
I don't know.

27:12.416 --> 27:15.384
But I'm not gonna stick
around and find out.

27:15.386 --> 27:17.786
So I say we act like
white people and disappear

27:17.788 --> 27:19.855
And let our lawyer
do the talking.

27:22.259 --> 27:24.260
Does that guy look like he's got

27:24.262 --> 27:26.895
Seven different bank accounts?

27:26.897 --> 27:29.265
So it was chuchito's job
to take big chunks of money,

27:29.267 --> 27:31.267
Split it up,
and put it in a bank.

27:31.269 --> 27:33.269
Yeah, not "a" bank.

27:33.271 --> 27:35.237
Rayburn national bank.

27:35.239 --> 27:37.273
Look it... now he's gonna walk
back to the guy in the truck.

27:37.275 --> 27:39.441
Who's that guy?

27:39.443 --> 27:42.444
And you're telling me all
these men work for a woman?

27:42.446 --> 27:45.047
You ever heard of a woman
that works for the cartel?

27:45.049 --> 27:47.149
Not unless she's
sucking on a dick.

27:47.151 --> 27:49.285
I'm serious.

27:49.287 --> 27:51.453
Chuchito was supposed
to set up a new money house

27:51.455 --> 27:52.821
And then he was killed.

27:52.823 --> 27:54.089
It doesn't really
look like it's

27:54.091 --> 27:56.392
Affecting business
much, does it?

28:03.099 --> 28:06.201
<i>Do you ever think about tate?</i>

28:08.338 --> 28:10.072
He killed my son.

28:10.074 --> 28:12.474
Of course I think about him.

28:12.476 --> 28:15.444
Why did he do it?

28:15.446 --> 28:18.514
Sometimes...

28:18.516 --> 28:22.017
In the middle of the night...

28:23.486 --> 28:26.288
...Gus is there with me.

28:26.290 --> 28:28.924
I don't believe in ghosts.

28:28.926 --> 28:32.161
No. It's not like that.

28:34.464 --> 28:37.333
I can feel his presence
in the room.

28:37.335 --> 28:40.502
And it's good.

28:40.504 --> 28:44.173
Sometimes I think
I can hear his voice.

28:49.113 --> 28:51.547
That's never happened to me.

28:53.883 --> 28:56.251
Well, that is all I have left.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.463
You still haven't shaved.

29:13.336 --> 29:15.404
I brought you something.

29:23.380 --> 29:25.981
It's an apache tear.

29:25.983 --> 29:28.050
Here.

29:30.420 --> 29:32.588
It's beautiful.

29:32.590 --> 29:34.256
When the apaches
were fighting the cavalry,

29:34.258 --> 29:37.025
They knew they were gonna lose.

29:37.027 --> 29:39.428
So they rode their
horses off cliffs.

29:39.430 --> 29:41.397
When their mothers cried,

29:41.399 --> 29:44.233
Their tears turned
into stones.

29:44.235 --> 29:45.501
Like this one.

29:47.937 --> 29:50.172
So they say.

29:50.174 --> 29:51.440
It made you think of me?

29:51.442 --> 29:53.442
Yes.

29:56.613 --> 29:57.679
Thank you.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.187
Bob told me
you're, uh,

30:05.189 --> 30:07.456
Beginning to remember
details about that night.

30:13.229 --> 30:14.963
If you want to...

30:14.965 --> 30:17.599
Talk...

30:17.601 --> 30:19.535
I could be the one to listen.

30:24.274 --> 30:28.343
None of those men will ever pay
for what they did.

30:29.446 --> 30:31.413
Nothing I say will stop it

30:31.415 --> 30:32.415
From happening again.

30:32.416 --> 30:34.149
I don't agree.

30:37.086 --> 30:38.387
I do not agree.

30:43.126 --> 30:45.561
You're not alone
in the darkness.

31:05.682 --> 31:08.250
What do you want to know?

31:08.252 --> 31:10.018
You see what I mean?

31:10.020 --> 31:13.021
The creature is essentially
just a sphere with eyeballs.

31:13.023 --> 31:16.258
And we can't even
begin to comprehend

31:16.260 --> 31:19.461
The-the scope and range

31:19.463 --> 31:20.629
Of that creature's vision.

31:20.631 --> 31:22.264
And I'm not talking about,

31:22.266 --> 31:23.632
Like, a seven-headed hydra,
I'm talking...

31:23.634 --> 31:25.667
Sunday school's over, bob.

31:29.272 --> 31:30.272
Aah!

31:56.568 --> 31:59.503
Dex.

31:59.505 --> 32:00.704
You make noise,
I will kill your mother.

32:00.706 --> 32:02.773
Do you understand?

32:05.410 --> 32:07.478
Good boy.

32:11.750 --> 32:14.218
Do you know why I'm here?

32:14.220 --> 32:15.286
No.

32:18.323 --> 32:19.690
Please...

32:19.692 --> 32:22.660
You looked upon me, dex.

32:23.728 --> 32:25.763
I didn't mean to.

32:25.765 --> 32:26.765
Please...

32:26.766 --> 32:29.700
Kyle wanted to touch.

32:29.702 --> 32:31.101
Do you want to touch?

32:31.103 --> 32:32.236
No.

32:34.172 --> 32:35.172
Where is kyle?

32:35.174 --> 32:37.174
I changed him.

32:37.176 --> 32:38.342
Do you want to see?

32:38.344 --> 32:40.778
No.

32:40.780 --> 32:42.346
Come, I'll show you.

32:42.348 --> 32:43.747
Come.
No, I really
don't want to.

32:51.756 --> 32:54.625
You're really just
a little boy, aren't you?

32:57.463 --> 32:59.530
I can see the light.

33:02.601 --> 33:05.202
You are full of it.

33:07.238 --> 33:08.806
Close your eyes.

33:10.609 --> 33:12.576
Close your eyes.

33:25.156 --> 33:28.826
Your friend...
He's with the butterflies.

33:53.518 --> 33:55.419
What else
did she say?

33:55.421 --> 33:57.521
She said she had kyle

33:57.523 --> 33:59.189
And she wanted me to go see him.

33:59.191 --> 34:00.658
Why didn't you?

34:00.660 --> 34:03.427
She changed her mind, I guess.

34:03.429 --> 34:05.429
And then she just left?

34:05.431 --> 34:06.497
Why?

34:07.465 --> 34:09.565
Something happened.

34:11.302 --> 34:13.303
You need to tell us everything,

34:13.304 --> 34:15.773
Dex.

34:15.775 --> 34:16.674
I had an accident.

34:16.676 --> 34:17.875
I couldn't help it.

34:17.877 --> 34:18.942
I peed in the bed.

34:22.647 --> 34:24.648
She told me to
close my eyes

34:24.650 --> 34:26.216
And then, when
I opened them,

34:26.217 --> 34:27.217
She was gone.

34:27.219 --> 34:29.286
Did she say where kyle was?

34:29.288 --> 34:30.821
No...

34:30.822 --> 34:33.857
Just that he was
with the butterflies.

34:33.859 --> 34:36.694
I don't know
what she meant.

34:44.902 --> 34:47.571
If I scream...

34:47.572 --> 34:49.639
It's gonna be the same.

34:51.909 --> 34:53.976
You understand?

34:55.880 --> 34:57.715
Yes.

35:00.919 --> 35:02.319
N-no.

35:03.254 --> 35:05.322
Please, not the gun.

35:07.325 --> 35:08.759
I want to be pretty.

35:21.506 --> 35:22.773
This is what
I'm gonna do.

35:22.775 --> 35:26.343
I'm gonna put it
up into your ribs.

35:26.345 --> 35:28.579
Straight into
your heart.

35:28.581 --> 35:29.880
You understand?

35:29.882 --> 35:33.517
Oh... Don't cry, beautiful.

35:52.303 --> 35:54.371
Jesus.

36:13.625 --> 36:15.893
What have I done?

36:38.650 --> 36:39.983
There.

36:43.354 --> 36:44.788
What the hell?

36:44.790 --> 36:45.856
What is this place?

36:45.858 --> 36:48.826
It used to be a sanctuary
for butterflies.

36:48.828 --> 36:50.594
Monarchs.

36:50.596 --> 36:53.664
My sister took
me here once.

36:53.666 --> 36:55.833
They still use it
on their way to mexico.

37:08.046 --> 37:09.546
Hey. Look.

37:24.395 --> 37:25.395
Oh...

37:30.835 --> 37:32.035
It's kyle.
