00:02.336 --> 00:03.670
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:05.422 --> 00:09.050
Winona, do you know what's going on here?
I'm being framed of a murder I didn't commit.

00:09.385 --> 00:10.593
I found the gun.

00:11.595 --> 00:12.595
Thank you.

00:12.888 --> 00:14.639
This time, seriously, don't come find me.

00:14.765 --> 00:15.848
Go tell your boss

00:15.933 --> 00:17.433
- I got the gun that killed Gary.
- Do you?

00:17.518 --> 00:19.143
Ask him where he thinks
it might turn up next.

00:19.228 --> 00:20.937
You have no idea...

00:21.605 --> 00:22.939
What are you gonna do?

00:23.273 --> 00:25.024
Make sure Ellen May don't get hurt.

00:25.109 --> 00:26.609
Thanks for coming by, Raylan.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.446
What brings you to Lexington?

00:30.531 --> 00:33.866
I just wanted to let you know
Boyd Crowder is backing a man for sheriff.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.618
You came all this way to tell me that?

00:35.786 --> 00:38.162
I likes to back the winning side.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.832
I'm gonna want to know
what Mr. Quarles is up to.

00:41.125 --> 00:42.625
I believe you can help me out there, huh?

00:43.127 --> 00:44.961
You need someone
who knows his way around Harlan.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.548
- I got the sheriff.
- Well, someone who ain't the law.

00:48.632 --> 00:51.175
So what I need is a federal fugitive
who assaulted a US Marshal.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.385
I don't think so.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.470
Mr. Quarles, sir,
I will do anything to make it right.

00:58.475 --> 01:02.311
You were supposed to wait until I get back
in the house before you set that thing off.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.063
Get me what you owe me,

01:04.147 --> 01:06.607
or next time, I won't even wait
for you to get out of the car.

02:32.778 --> 02:34.070
Rachel said you wanted to see me.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.697
Yes, come in. Shut that door behind you.

02:36.990 --> 02:37.990
This isn't good.

02:38.534 --> 02:41.744
No. I'll be gentle. Who's Brady Hughes?

02:43.705 --> 02:44.914
You been checking up on me?

02:45.040 --> 02:47.458
Yes. Duh. Who is he?

02:47.793 --> 02:50.962
Switchboard said that yesterday
you got an anonymous call

02:51.046 --> 02:54.924
that said, "Tell Deputy Givens
to ask Quarles about Brady Hughes."

02:55.008 --> 02:57.677
All I can tell you is what I got when
I ran the name through the database,

02:57.761 --> 03:00.429
which I'm not gonna share with you
'cause I know you already did the same.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.184
What does Quarles want
with a missing hustler?

03:05.978 --> 03:07.603
He just about killed one in Detroit.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.523
So, what? You went down there
to where Brady turns his tricks...

03:10.607 --> 03:12.066
- Yeah.
- ...and then you asked them all

03:12.150 --> 03:14.527
if anybody had seen him with Quarles?

03:14.778 --> 03:17.280
None of the other rent boys
were too anxious to speak.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.823
What do you have on Quarles?

03:19.449 --> 03:21.033
- What do I have on Quarles?
- Yeah.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.202
What have we been talking about?

03:23.287 --> 03:26.289
What do you have on Quarles right now
that you can prove?

03:28.542 --> 03:31.002
That's what I thought.
Look, we're gonna shut this down.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.920
- Shut what down?
- You and Quarles.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.840
Us and Quarles. 'Cause no matter
how big a scumbag he is,

03:35.924 --> 03:39.093
until he runs afoul of federal law
enforcement, he's not Marshal business.

03:39.177 --> 03:40.219
He tried to destroy my life.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.805
And even if he was Marshal business,
he wouldn't be yours.

03:43.515 --> 03:46.475
You're gonna have to step back now.
You got it?

03:50.272 --> 03:51.606
Don't hog it all!

03:51.857 --> 03:52.857
I'm not.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.486
All right. There's plenty for everybody.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.405
Just hurry your asses up.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.908
You want us to be pumped, don't you?

04:01.992 --> 04:04.952
No, what I want is for you to go out
and make me some goddamn money.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.041
You bitches ready? It's show time.

04:31.355 --> 04:35.483
Everybody get down on the ground!
You too! You deaf?

04:46.328 --> 04:47.578
Oh, shit!

04:49.206 --> 04:50.831
J.J., open the door! Open the door!
You got her?

04:50.916 --> 04:53.042
I got her, J.J.! I got her!

04:53.710 --> 04:54.752
Come on!

04:55.087 --> 04:57.380
- Oh, shit!
- Go, go!

05:29.913 --> 05:32.081
He grabbed my gun!
There was nothing I could do!

05:32.165 --> 05:33.666
She's right. It happened so fast.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.127
God damn it! You kill anybody?

05:36.211 --> 05:37.837
I don't know. Krystal shot back at him.

05:37.921 --> 05:41.424
Took off half his skull.
The clerk took a bullet, too.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.758
Shit.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.720
It's okay, baby-poo! Oh, my God.
We're gonna get you help.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.388
Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

05:47.472 --> 05:48.848
What? What?

05:48.932 --> 05:50.891
- No, no, no!
- She's dead.

05:52.269 --> 05:54.520
- You shut up!
- Ellen May, shut her up

05:54.604 --> 05:57.231
or hand to God, I'll run this van
right off a goddamn cliff!

05:57.315 --> 06:00.026
Shut up! Shut up!
You got to shut up right now.

06:00.110 --> 06:01.652
- You got to shut up.
- All right.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.947
Now, it's terrible
what happened to Krystal, huh?

06:05.032 --> 06:08.242
Don't make it worse by losing your shit.
That's the last thing she'd want.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.413
The last thing she'd want
is to have her guts spilling on the ground.

06:12.539 --> 06:16.125
Krystal was a soldier. She knew the risks.

06:16.918 --> 06:20.212
And she'd want us to, you know,
soldier on, huh?

06:20.756 --> 06:24.800
Wouldn't she?

06:25.427 --> 06:27.303
- Yes.
- I suppose.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.889
All right. Let's fix this.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.809
For Krystal, huh?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.395
I could use a pill.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.525
Now, that's more like it. Yeah.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.236
Ask and ye shall receive.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.074
Can't we just bury her?

06:48.617 --> 06:51.869
No, darling. We need the slurry to eat her up.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.206
Couple days, there'll be nothing left of her.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.832
She deserves better than this.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.126
You got something to say, Ellen May?

07:00.003 --> 07:02.254
- No.
- All right. Best not.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.178
Go on. Toss her in.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.158
- Well, what do we do now?
- We cover our tracks.

07:34.538 --> 07:37.456
Ellen May? Ellen May?

07:56.476 --> 08:00.062
Ava Crowder, just what my day
has been missing.

08:00.939 --> 08:04.066
Bet you feel like
all I do lately is ask you for favors,

08:04.234 --> 08:06.110
but, Raylan, if you just give me...

08:09.239 --> 08:12.408
For you, I got all the time in the world.

08:14.077 --> 08:18.372
- So, you're saying you ended it this time?
- I'm saying I played a big part.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.918
- Elmer T. Lee single barrel, water back.
- I just asked for a whiskey.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.795
Friends of the deputy get top shelf.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.174
She clearly has a crush on you.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.802
- Are we talking about the bartender?
- She is awful pretty.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.596
If you're into that sort of thing.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.764
Little long in the tooth
to be dressed like that, though.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.265
I'm willing to forgive her.

08:38.268 --> 08:39.476
Boyd tells me you shot a woman.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.770
Are you two still close?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.606
What was that like? Different?

08:43.690 --> 08:46.192
I can't say what it's like
to shoot anybody, Ava.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.818
As a rule, women aren't into crimes

08:47.903 --> 08:49.987
where they get shot
by people in law enforcement,

08:50.071 --> 08:52.948
so we don't get that many opportunities
to shoot women.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.452
Well, if a person's holding a gun at you,
doesn't matter if they're wearing a dress.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.412
She was wearing pants.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.249
- Boyd the reason you're here?
- He is.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.293
Still think you can change him, huh?

09:04.377 --> 09:06.795
Not trying to change him.
I'm trying to help him.

09:08.757 --> 09:09.840
What?

09:10.050 --> 09:14.720
I'm reminded of a fugitive we were chasing,
a big fella named Tiny.

09:14.804 --> 09:19.725
Found out he was stepping out on his wife
with this pretty sorta-Rican girl.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.102
We knock on her door.
She answers in a see-through number.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.146
My boss says, "Where's Tiny?"

09:24.648 --> 09:26.023
And then she says, "He ain't here."

09:26.107 --> 09:31.445
And he says, "If he's here and you're lying,
you're going to jail."

09:32.322 --> 09:34.281
She says, "He's in the back."

09:36.159 --> 09:40.287
You understand? It wasn't like
she was hurting him or telling on him.

09:41.414 --> 09:45.334
There was just nothing she could do for him,
so she said, "Yeah, he's in the back."

09:46.670 --> 09:47.878
Did you catch him?

09:49.547 --> 09:52.508
You do know what Boyd is, right?

09:54.636 --> 09:55.844
I mean, you do know.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.433
He says he can help you
get to Robert Quarles.

10:04.771 --> 10:08.107
Then why didn't he come down here
and tell me himself?

10:11.152 --> 10:14.738
Well, I knew if anybody could sweet-talk you
into coming to see me, it'd be Ava.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.909
I hope you had a pleasant time,
but not too pleasant.

10:19.494 --> 10:21.704
Well, I'm here. That's the main thing.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.205
What do you got for me?

10:23.290 --> 10:25.457
The man who did the shooting
out at your Aunt Helen's house,

10:25.542 --> 10:27.042
- man with a limp...
- You know him?

10:27.127 --> 10:30.462
Well, I believe he's Robert Quarles'
point person in Harlan.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.548
He tried to turn Devil against me.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.635
- You gave him the limp.
- Well, I can get territorial.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.637
How is Devil? I haven't seen him.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.598
Well, he's calmed down a good bit
since last you saw him.

10:45.687 --> 10:46.812
And what's in this for you?

10:46.896 --> 10:50.190
Well, the man you threw out of that trailer
happens to be, I believe,

10:50.275 --> 10:52.026
the same man who committed the crime

10:52.110 --> 10:54.445
for which I find myself
currently incarcerated.

10:54.904 --> 10:57.573
You're asking me to go find
your "get out of jail free" card.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.702
Well, think of it this way. Now, you find
this guy, you get your man Quarles

11:02.162 --> 11:04.246
and you get to help out an old friend.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.248
Now, that's a win-win.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.002
You got a name?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.880
<i>Now, just exactly
where did this information come from?</i>

11:12.964 --> 11:17.509
Oh, Tom Bergen and his boys.
They been down here rattling the bushes.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.595
Fella name of Tanner Dodd popped up.

11:20.430 --> 11:24.641
Bergen, huh? You say his source is solid?

11:24.768 --> 11:27.144
100%. He's a known scumbag.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.147
I ain't surprised at all to hear
he's the same fella I threw out of the trailer.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.649
All right. Go get your fugitive.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.026
All right. Will do.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.363
Hey, Raylan.

11:37.447 --> 11:40.032
You ever hear of a fella named Tanner Dodd?

11:42.952 --> 11:44.244
You want me to frisk him?

11:44.329 --> 11:47.706
- Nah, that ain't necessary.
- I told him we were all pals up here now.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.751
Have a seat, Mr. Quarles. You hungry?

11:51.169 --> 11:53.212
No, thank you. I've eaten.

11:53.463 --> 11:57.716
You sure? Hell, Bernard's little, pretty mama
make the best shoofly pie I ever ate.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.301
You ever had shoofly pie?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.553
No, but judging by the name,
I'm sure it's delicious.

12:02.597 --> 12:05.557
Molasses. Butter, brown sugar.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.310
My, that sure am sweet!

12:10.021 --> 12:14.566
Indeed. And, like all sweet things,
it draws pests.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.235
Hence "shoofly"?

12:18.405 --> 12:20.322
Mr. Limehouse,
I'm sure you didn't invite me up here

12:20.407 --> 12:22.491
to discuss the sociology of baked goods.

12:22.617 --> 12:26.745
Well, last we spoke, you said you had a plan
for this county included the election.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.580
Of course. I'm from Detroit.

12:28.665 --> 12:32.084
Elected officials are always part
of the business plan. Are you on board?

12:32.168 --> 12:35.546
I am, just as soon as you tell me
who your campaign manager is.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.006
- Excuse me?
- For the election.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.510
No, no, no, no, no. I heard you.
I just don't understand why I need one.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.929
Crowder's in jail, Napier's a hero.
It's as good as won.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.806
Now, I'm sure it seems like that
from the outside,

12:45.890 --> 12:50.102
but around here,
elections ain't won without insurance.

12:51.479 --> 12:54.898
And no doubt you'll be
adding that "insurance" to my tab.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.652
Afraid I don't make donations
unless they tax-deductible.

12:58.736 --> 13:00.988
- Now, is that gonna be a problem?
- Open the box.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.079
No. It's not gonna be a problem.

13:09.539 --> 13:13.876
Good. Then you can give that box right there
to your new campaign manager.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.544
And where do I find this fella?

13:15.628 --> 13:17.713
He gonna be in my seat in about 10 minutes.

13:19.466 --> 13:20.883
Mr. Quarles.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.765
We're not open!

13:32.103 --> 13:34.855
Christ, we're not the only place in town
to get a drink!

13:41.279 --> 13:45.240
Ava, I prayed you'd be here.
Please. Please, you got to help me.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.829
Thank God you're here! Come on!

13:50.914 --> 13:53.332
- Mrs. Dodd?
- Hurry up! I think he's gonna kill her.

13:53.416 --> 13:54.666
- Who is?
- Vincent.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.376
- Where is he?
- He's in the woods.

13:57.629 --> 14:02.716
See, he was hunting, and he shot
what he thought was a deer.

14:02.800 --> 14:06.678
But it wasn't. It was Bernice.
She was spying on him.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.181
Well, at least I think it was Bernice.

14:09.557 --> 14:13.477
See, it could have been
her evil twin sister, Eloise.

14:13.937 --> 14:18.190
The problem is, I could not see
the beauty mark on the TV.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.192
Mrs. Dodd, is there anyone
in the house with you?

14:20.276 --> 14:21.735
No. That's why I need you.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.320
I've got something
I need to discuss with you.

14:23.404 --> 14:27.449
Here. Well, I ain't discussing nothing
until you help me get this TV working.

14:27.575 --> 14:30.118
- Now, hold that up high.
- Mrs. Dodd. Mrs. Dodd.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.871
No, call me Imogene.
And hold that up nice and high.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.289
- I'm sorry, Imogene.
- No, wait. What?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.375
I'm not here to help you with your TV.

14:36.459 --> 14:40.087
I'm here
because I'm looking for your boy, Tanner.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.799
- I haven't seen him in years.
- I don't think that's true.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.844
I think you saw him the other day,
when he brought over that brand-new TV.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.763
He brought it because he loves his mama.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.057
Only he didn't have a chance to hook it up,
did he?

14:52.141 --> 14:53.892
No. Because he's in trouble.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.478
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:56.563 --> 14:59.064
I think you do. I know you love your boy

14:59.148 --> 15:01.066
and you don't want to see him
get in any more trouble,

15:01.150 --> 15:03.527
but you should know,
I'm not the only one looking for him.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.280
There are some very dangerous men
after him, too.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.489
- Really?
- And don't you think

15:07.574 --> 15:10.492
it would be best if I found him first?

15:11.828 --> 15:13.704
- So you could help him?
- That's right.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.998
Oh, that would be so good.

15:17.208 --> 15:22.629
Did you ever think of trying the one
where he accidentally ingested poison

15:22.714 --> 15:25.299
and you're the only one with the antidote?

15:25.383 --> 15:26.717
Excuse me?

15:26.801 --> 15:32.806
Look, the first time some no-dick lawman
came around and ran that game with me,

15:32.890 --> 15:36.727
Tanner was 10 years old.
Now you get the hell out!

15:39.314 --> 15:42.482
Yes, ma'am. In case you change your mind.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.739
Now, we'll concentrate our first haul here

15:48.823 --> 15:51.450
'cause if you ain't got Vernon Creek,
you ain't gonna win.

15:51.534 --> 15:54.119
Now, that is, unless you got Jameston Holler.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.705
Now, once we make sure they vote right,

15:56.789 --> 15:59.458
we give them each a playing card
to exchange for the booze.

15:59.542 --> 16:03.295
Now, personally, I like to use a face card
because they're more distinct to a deck,

16:03.379 --> 16:04.671
makes it harder for people
to bring in their own...

16:04.756 --> 16:07.799
Excuse me, Harvey?
Aren't I paying you to do this for me?

16:08.384 --> 16:11.261
Well, yeah. Oh, but I take pride in my work.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.472
I like people to understand
the services I am providing.

16:13.556 --> 16:16.016
And this town-hall-debate circle jerk?

16:16.225 --> 16:17.809
Well, that's VFW. That ain't town hall.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.604
You know, we gonna
have to tread light with that, too.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.522
No, I'm serious.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.816
As many times as votes been rigged
for these people,

16:24.901 --> 16:26.943
they're pretty quick
to spot a fix when they see one.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.153
You know, I got to be honest with you,
Harvey,

16:28.237 --> 16:31.031
I'm not sure I'm understanding
the services you're providing on that one.

16:31.115 --> 16:34.743
Well, we make sure that Napier scores,

16:34.827 --> 16:38.664
and then I just gavel out
before Shelby can even respond.

16:38.748 --> 16:42.793
Now, as I was saying,
a face card gets a bottle.

16:42.877 --> 16:45.212
The more status a person has,
the bigger bottle they get.

16:46.297 --> 16:48.507
I found that works, you know.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.176
- How long's he gonna be in there?
- Relax.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.595
They're almost done.

16:55.723 --> 16:57.391
Hey, Ma. What?

16:58.142 --> 16:59.226
Shit.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.978
Okay. I love you, too.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.232
I got a problem.

17:11.114 --> 17:14.031
Tanner's mama says the marshal's
been coming around looking for him.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.368
He's thinking of running.

17:19.288 --> 17:21.915
He got any unfinished business
could come back on us?

17:21.999 --> 17:23.916
- I don't know.
- "I don't know."

17:24.210 --> 17:29.047
That's an acceptable answer if I ask you
why the sun come up each day

17:29.132 --> 17:32.300
or why God chose to give man
dominion over the animals.

17:32.635 --> 17:37.514
But if I ask you if your friend Tanner
left any loose ends

17:37.598 --> 17:39.808
that could point probing fingers
back at this holler,

17:40.476 --> 17:42.185
you say, "No," you understand me?

17:42.520 --> 17:44.354
Yes, sir, Mr. Limehouse.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.106
Now, you go with Tanner,

17:46.190 --> 17:50.819
and you make sure he ties things
in a tight, little bow before he take flight,

17:50.903 --> 17:53.655
else we have our own unfinished business
to tend to.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.743
Hear?

18:02.248 --> 18:07.669
It has been an honor and a privilege
to serve the people of this county.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.171
- Come in.
- Sheriff Napier.

18:10.131 --> 18:11.590
US Marshal Raylan Givens.

18:11.674 --> 18:14.634
- What can I do for the Marshals Office?
- This is Special Agent Masters, ATF.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.763
- ATF?
- I never understood why it's not ATFE.

18:18.097 --> 18:21.600
"E" is what brought us here,
the recent bombing of your car.

18:21.684 --> 18:24.269
Well, that case was closed. We have the man
who set the device in custody.

18:24.353 --> 18:28.106
Our concern is that Crowder
may have not acted alone,

18:28.191 --> 18:30.984
may have had an accomplice,
a fella named Tanner Dodd.

18:31.068 --> 18:32.152
Never heard of him.

18:32.236 --> 18:35.697
Well, his name's come up
in a number of bombing investigations.

18:35.865 --> 18:38.200
So, Masters checked out your car
this morning.

18:40.036 --> 18:41.077
He what?

18:42.538 --> 18:43.705
On whose authority?

18:44.165 --> 18:48.335
President, Congress, United States
of America. Anyway, sure enough,

18:48.419 --> 18:51.922
the rigging device, it matched Tanner's MO.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.800
We're pretty confident
Boyd Crowder acted alone.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.635
Agent Masters is one of the best.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.428
That why he doesn't talk, doesn't smile?

18:58.554 --> 19:01.932
Just stands in my doorway
like a big, hot, steaming pile of shit?

19:04.435 --> 19:06.728
Social awkwardness
is often the curse of genius.

19:07.355 --> 19:10.065
Anyway, you get a line on this guy Dodd,

19:10.149 --> 19:12.234
we're gonna want to talk to him
as soon as possible.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.777
You give us a call if you do, okay?

19:14.237 --> 19:15.654
- Count on it.
- Pleasure.

19:20.368 --> 19:21.743
Good luck with that speech.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.579
- I did good, didn't I?
- You did.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.040
Hey, man, you want to grab a beer
or something?

19:27.124 --> 19:29.251
It's a little early in the morning for me.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.253
Plus, I'd like you to get going
before the sheriff spots you,

19:31.337 --> 19:33.463
wonders why a bomb tech drives a big rig.

19:35.007 --> 19:37.259
Hey. My vest?

19:38.135 --> 19:40.303
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.058
Take it easy, buddy.

19:49.272 --> 19:50.897
Might be a little ragged, but it's clean.

19:52.400 --> 19:53.525
There we go.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.113
Music always helps me
take my mind off things.

19:58.531 --> 20:02.242
- Ava, I can't...
- It's okay, honey. You just relax.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.493
Yeah.

20:04.745 --> 20:06.371
Maybe even get a little sleep.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.956
Ava!

20:08.124 --> 20:10.917
It's okay! It's okay! You're safe. You're okay.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.296
Ava!

20:15.923 --> 20:17.883
Why was the damn door locked?
Should have been open an hour ago.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.801
Johnny. Ellen May's here.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.263
- Delroy's girl?
- Said Delroy killed another girl

20:23.347 --> 20:24.764
and she's gonna be next.

20:26.475 --> 20:30.103
Look, Ava, I know you got a big heart
and you're always bringing in broken things,

20:30.187 --> 20:32.731
trying to make them well,
but she ain't a stray kitten.

20:32.815 --> 20:33.899
You can't keep her.

20:33.983 --> 20:36.526
I was thinking that maybe you'd take her in.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.155
Might do you good
having a woman around the house.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.825
That's what you were thinking, huh?

20:48.331 --> 20:52.125
That is very sweet of you, Ava,

20:55.212 --> 20:56.588
but I always wanted a blond.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.135
Go back there and look at her,
how messed up she is.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.930
Look, it's not about that.
This is just business, okay?

21:05.014 --> 21:07.974
Delroy pays us protection money.
She does not.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.517
- You got to turn her over.
- He'll kill her.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.686
That's what she told you,
but she's an Oxy addict.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.146
How do you know
she's not here scheming you

21:13.230 --> 21:15.482
for more pills or money or some shit?

21:19.362 --> 21:22.238
Boyd is in jail again.

21:23.532 --> 21:24.783
And we don't know for how long.

21:25.201 --> 21:28.787
And in the meantime,
everyone's got to just make their own way.

21:29.163 --> 21:32.290
You and me,
we got to take care of each other.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.211
All right.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.880
- "All right" what?
- I'll turn her in.

21:41.008 --> 21:42.175
That's what Boyd would do.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.594
I don't believe you.

22:02.571 --> 22:05.573
- Who's this?
- Delroy. It's Ava Crowder.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.493
Ms. Crowder, this ain't such a good time.
I can't...

22:08.577 --> 22:10.954
- I got your girl.
- Which girl?

22:11.080 --> 22:13.581
You know which one. You want her back,

22:13.666 --> 22:15.875
you're gonna have to bring me
a little something for my trouble.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.003
I already pay Boyd protection.

22:18.087 --> 22:21.297
Well, Boyd didn't find her, I did.
And I charge a finder's fee.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.258
How's 2 grand sound?

22:24.427 --> 22:25.844
Sounds like I don't have a choice.

22:25.928 --> 22:28.179
You don't. It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.184
Believe me now?

22:37.940 --> 22:39.941
Well, how much did you pay
for the explosives?

22:40.026 --> 22:41.359
5 grand. Why?

22:41.444 --> 22:43.778
You might as well get your money back
before you pop him.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.157
Hold up. Yeah, what do you want?

22:47.283 --> 22:48.658
I just want to give you what I owe you.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.368
Yeah? What brought you to your senses?

22:50.453 --> 22:53.121
Well, that's a lot of money.
Takes time to gather, is all.

22:53.372 --> 22:54.873
How about I come by your place tonight?

22:54.957 --> 22:57.167
<i>Well, actually,
I think you ought to stay out of sight.</i>

22:57.626 --> 23:02.505
How about... How about we meet?
Meet at Pine Top in two hours.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.215
Fine.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.635
Looks like I'm about to double my money.

23:36.373 --> 23:37.415
Back for more?

23:37.792 --> 23:38.875
Not exactly.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.294
I need a refund.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.213
So that's how it is.

23:44.006 --> 23:45.048
Pretty much.

23:45.674 --> 23:49.177
Well, money's in the back,
on top of the green cabinet.

23:50.346 --> 23:51.679
After you.

23:55.518 --> 23:56.601
As you like it.

24:04.193 --> 24:06.611
You do anything squirrelly,
you get a bullet in the back of your head.

24:08.864 --> 24:10.156
It's up there.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.163
What was that?

24:17.248 --> 24:20.416
Son, you best don't move,
else we're all dead.

24:20.709 --> 24:21.835
Bullshit.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.087
- You ever heard of a Bouncing Betty?
- A what?

24:24.505 --> 24:27.215
- It's a goddamn land mine!
- That's right.

24:27.883 --> 24:31.094
In Vietnam, I've seen them cut men in half.

24:31.554 --> 24:36.391
I got this one rigged so that it don't bounce.
Less damage to my shop.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.227
Don't make any difference to you.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.606
Turn it off. Turn it off right goddamn now!

24:43.816 --> 24:48.194
Son, you shoot me now,
you'll spend the rest of your life in this room.

24:48.571 --> 24:50.363
I'm the only one that can disarm it.

24:50.990 --> 24:56.035
And I will, but not until you boys
hand over your weapons. Both of them.

24:56.871 --> 24:59.414
Shit. You goddamn son of a bitch!

25:00.875 --> 25:02.208
Choice is yours, son.

25:07.631 --> 25:10.133
I put down my gun, I won't blow up?

25:10.885 --> 25:12.302
Not if you do it slow.

25:20.978 --> 25:22.770
Goddamn, Errol! What did you do that for?

25:22.855 --> 25:25.440
Sorry, man. I got my own loose ends
to clean up.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.108
You try to leave, I'll shoot you.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.696
I don't think you want to do that.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.781
Now I'm the only one
who knows about this here predicament.

25:33.908 --> 25:34.991
Unless you gonna call the cops,

25:35.075 --> 25:37.577
you need me to go and look for somebody
to turn that bad boy off.

25:37.661 --> 25:39.245
Bullshit.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.206
You're not gonna tell anyone where I'm at.

25:41.874 --> 25:45.543
You're gonna leave me here to either blow up
or spend the rest of my life in prison.

25:45.628 --> 25:48.963
How about I step off this thing right now,
take you with me?

25:49.798 --> 25:53.885
You could. But won't be no one left to
make sure your mama don't fall to no harm.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.765
Now, you let me walk out of that door
right there,

25:58.849 --> 25:59.891
I'll take that bag of cash to her,

25:59.975 --> 26:02.518
make sure she don't never want for anything
as long as she lives.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.646
You got Mr. Limehouse's word on that.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.173
Errol.

26:54.822 --> 26:55.822
Givens.

26:55.906 --> 26:58.283
- Raylan, we found Tanner.
- You did? How?

26:58.367 --> 26:59.534
<i>Believe it or not, he called us.</i>

27:00.286 --> 27:01.286
<i>How's he doing?</i>

27:01.370 --> 27:04.706
Not so good. He's over at Lemuel Briggs'
place, standing on a land mine.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.418
Unbelievable. See you in a bit.

27:22.725 --> 27:25.518
Sheriff, I'm pretty certain he ain't coming.

27:31.275 --> 27:32.525
Ellen May.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.485
Wake up.

27:38.866 --> 27:41.117
I can't believe I actually slept.

27:42.244 --> 27:44.912
- Here. Drink this.
- Thanks.

27:51.879 --> 27:54.339
- Put this around your wrists.
- Huh?

27:55.049 --> 27:56.591
- Go on.
- Wait!

27:56.675 --> 27:59.260
- Tighten it up.
- No. What did I do? No, please.

27:59.386 --> 28:01.679
- I need you to stand up.
- What did I do? No!

28:01.764 --> 28:06.559
- Walk to the door, Ellen May.
- No, please! I'm sorry! No, please.

28:06.769 --> 28:08.269
- Open the door.
- Please don't make me do this.

28:08.354 --> 28:10.730
- Open the door, Ellen May!
- Don't make me...

28:10.898 --> 28:12.607
Shut up! Walk!

28:13.025 --> 28:14.108
Hey, darling.

28:14.735 --> 28:18.279
No, no, no, no, no! Please! Please, Ava!
No, please! He's gonna kill me!

28:18.364 --> 28:19.822
- Shut up!
- Please! He's gonna...

28:19.907 --> 28:22.408
I got to tell you to shut up again,
I'll shoot you myself!

28:25.329 --> 28:27.955
- Satisfied?
- Yeah. All right.

28:31.627 --> 28:32.835
All right.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.380
See, darling, you got to understand,
business is always gonna triumph.

28:46.517 --> 28:47.934
Help me clean this up.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.609
- Raylan, you know Keaton from ATF.
- Happy you're here.

28:57.236 --> 29:01.406
Not sure I am. Lemuel Briggs
is one crafty son of a bitch,

29:01.490 --> 29:03.783
knows explosives
better than most of my techs.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.743
- I ain't going near that thing.
- He still armed?

29:05.828 --> 29:08.746
Yeah. He's afraid to put his gun down,
says the weight change might set it off.

29:08.831 --> 29:11.416
Knowing Lemuel, he might not be wrong.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.167
Make sure all communications are off.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.800
- Tanner.
- Marshal.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.469
- I need you to drop that gun.
- Can't.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.847
Lemuel said if I move, I blow up.

29:32.855 --> 29:35.690
Well, you raise it,
the situation's gonna be a lot simpler.

29:35.858 --> 29:37.567
I ain't raising shit.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.194
Can't even hardly feel my arms.

29:40.279 --> 29:41.696
Damn, that's a nice setup.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.573
- Can you defuse it?
- Of course.

29:45.242 --> 29:46.576
It's gonna take a few hours.

29:46.660 --> 29:48.744
No way, man.
You got to work faster than that.

29:48.829 --> 29:51.205
My legs are about to give out,
and I got to piss like a racehorse.

29:51.373 --> 29:53.833
All right, take it easy, Tanner.
He's working on it.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.377
How about you take this time
to tell me about your boss, huh?

29:56.503 --> 29:57.962
How about you get me the hell out of here?

29:58.046 --> 30:00.173
You know, I just left your friend Napier.

30:00.257 --> 30:04.135
He was waiting for you in a secluded spot
with a shovel and a rope.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.304
What was that about?
You guys doing some gardening?

30:07.264 --> 30:10.308
- Did Quarles order the car bombing?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

30:10.392 --> 30:11.559
Come on, Tanner.

30:11.643 --> 30:15.855
We already got you on multiple murders,
not to mention assaulting a federal officer.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.149
And, although I haven't done forensics yet,

30:18.233 --> 30:20.818
I'm pretty sure that's a dead body
at your feet there.

30:20.903 --> 30:22.695
Now, why don't you tell me something

30:22.779 --> 30:25.156
that'll make life easier for you
down the road?

30:26.158 --> 30:28.951
Are you trying to cut a deal with me
when I'm standing on a land mine?

30:29.953 --> 30:31.162
No better time.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.330
Shit.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.332
You're just like your mama.

30:35.751 --> 30:36.876
She okay?

30:37.419 --> 30:38.920
She is. She misses you.

30:39.171 --> 30:43.007
Tell you what, you help me out,
we get you out of here,

30:43.091 --> 30:45.801
I'll take you by her place,
you can help her set up her TV, huh?

30:45.928 --> 30:48.095
Hey, you get me off this thing,
I'll tell you anything.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.222
Quarles, Napier, whoever.

30:49.306 --> 30:53.059
No. You tell me right now, or Keaton and I
are gonna take a lunch break.

30:53.143 --> 30:55.061
- I'm a little hungry.
- Bullshit.

30:55.270 --> 30:57.021
Quarles order the hit on the Oxy clinic?

30:57.105 --> 30:59.607
My legs are giving out, man,
and my hands are sweating rivers!

30:59.691 --> 31:01.192
Did he kill Gary?

31:01.318 --> 31:03.444
You need to chill out, pal.

31:03.529 --> 31:04.820
Oh, shit!

31:06.740 --> 31:09.033
- You sit tight.
- What happened? What'd I do?

31:09.117 --> 31:11.869
Oh, you're gonna be fine.
I'm just gonna go get the robot.

31:11.954 --> 31:13.829
- Oh, no, no, no, man.
- We need to get out of here.

31:13.956 --> 31:16.290
- He needs to tell me what I...
- Come on, man!

31:16.416 --> 31:19.252
God damn it! Did Quarles kill Gary?

31:19.503 --> 31:20.795
Everybody get back!

31:21.004 --> 31:23.839
- Keaton, what the hell's going on?
- The thing armed itself.

31:23.924 --> 31:26.467
Armed itself? Are you saying
that thing's gonna go off?

31:26.552 --> 31:29.178
It's hard to say. But if the thing arms itself,
you get the hell...

31:44.903 --> 31:50.992
<i>Since I've been in office, violent crime
in this county's down almost 12%.</i>

31:52.286 --> 31:56.789
<i>Now, Washington's always trying
to fix something that ain't broke.</i>

31:56.873 --> 32:00.459
<i>But I like to think down here, we know better.</i>

32:01.336 --> 32:02.503
Rebuttal?

32:02.588 --> 32:06.632
<i>Way I understand it,
violent crime is down all over.</i>

32:06.717 --> 32:10.511
<i>Mr. Shelby, I believe
you'll want to argue against me.</i>

32:13.348 --> 32:15.433
Now, I will remind both candidates

32:15.517 --> 32:19.145
to please not interrupt
or address each other directly.

32:19.229 --> 32:21.939
<i>Yes, sir, but given Mr. Shelby's
lack of experience,</i>

32:22.024 --> 32:24.650
<i>I'm trying to help him understand
the concerns of the local...</i>

32:24.735 --> 32:27.445
<i>I was a lawman for 20 years.</i>

32:27.529 --> 32:31.032
<i>And now you work at the Mega Shop
as a greeter.</i>

32:32.284 --> 32:34.118
<i>There's nothing wrong with honest work.</i>

32:34.202 --> 32:36.287
<i>Odd you would mention honest work,</i>

32:36.371 --> 32:40.458
<i>being as how you lost your security job
after a robbery</i>

32:40.542 --> 32:44.211
<i>in which you were suspected
of being the inside man.</i>

32:46.715 --> 32:48.174
That's enough.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.760
Now, next question.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.262
I got a question.

32:55.057 --> 33:00.811
<i>Mr. Moderator, this man is a convicted felon.
We don't let felons vote in this state, do we?</i>

33:00.896 --> 33:02.063
Well, I didn't come here to vote.

33:02.147 --> 33:04.774
<i>You wouldn't be here at all
if it weren't for the fact that a few hours ago,</i>

33:04.858 --> 33:07.485
<i>friends of yours
in the federal law enforcement field</i>

33:07.569 --> 33:10.196
<i>saw fit to intervene in our local affairs.</i>

33:10.280 --> 33:13.199
<i>Forced us to release him from the cell
he's been occupying</i>

33:13.283 --> 33:16.327
<i>since his cowardly attempt on my life.</i>

33:16.453 --> 33:19.955
Well, Mr. Napier, I'd like to think that
if I was behind an attempt on your life,

33:20.040 --> 33:21.916
at the very least,
I would have messed up your hair.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.003
All right, now.

33:26.505 --> 33:27.797
What's your question there, Boyd?

33:27.881 --> 33:29.840
Thank you, Harvey. My question is,

33:29.925 --> 33:33.260
does Mr. Napier know
the name of the company

33:33.345 --> 33:35.930
that fired Shelby from his security job?

33:36.932 --> 33:38.099
Well, I'll save you the trouble.

33:38.183 --> 33:40.267
The name of that company
was Black Pike Coal.

33:40.936 --> 33:44.814
Now, do you want us all to believe
that Shelby here's a dishonest man

33:44.898 --> 33:46.941
because Black Pike tells us so?

33:47.609 --> 33:49.652
Do you think that Shelby's
the only man in this room

33:49.736 --> 33:52.029
been done wrong
by a coal-mining company?

33:52.114 --> 33:55.700
<i>Mr. Moderator, how many questions
you gonna let this convict ask?</i>

33:55.784 --> 33:57.702
Mr. Napier, everybody here knows

33:57.786 --> 34:00.996
that the only men the company
doesn't do wrong are company men.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.334
And you stand up there
with your slick haircut.

34:05.919 --> 34:08.879
You look down on Shelby
because this man works for a living.

34:10.090 --> 34:13.134
You talk down to me
because I've been in trouble with the law.

34:13.217 --> 34:14.802
Well, you know when that trouble began?

34:15.637 --> 34:18.097
Why don't you ask your good friend
Harvey Jones? He was there.

34:18.639 --> 34:24.353
He was on the line when we struck out
at Eastover, Brookside, Duke Power scabs,

34:24.438 --> 34:29.442
and gun thugs coming after us
with bicycle chains and bats!

34:29.525 --> 34:31.569
Trying to run us over in their cars!

34:32.821 --> 34:37.241
And I know that you weren't there,
Mr. Napier.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.203
But there sure were a lot of men there
who looked like you.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.833
Men standing on the company side,

34:46.918 --> 34:48.918
laughing at all us hillbillies

34:49.004 --> 34:52.380
who were just trying to stand up
for what we believed in.

34:54.467 --> 34:57.845
Now, I'm not saying you're a bad man,
Mr. Napier. That I don't know.

34:59.306 --> 35:01.515
But what I do know

35:01.600 --> 35:04.143
is that you've been feeding too long
at the public trough.

35:07.355 --> 35:13.152
Now, I don't know about the rest of you,
but I'm gonna say no to the company man.

35:13.361 --> 35:15.571
- No!
- I'm gonna say no

35:15.655 --> 35:19.909
to the lawmen who disrespect the rights
of the people

35:19.993 --> 35:21.827
whose taxes pay for their salaries!

35:22.496 --> 35:25.498
And I'm gonna say no, I'm gonna say no,

35:25.582 --> 35:28.125
I'm gonna say no to Sheriff Tillman Napier,

35:28.210 --> 35:32.004
who laughs in our faces
while he makes money off our backs!

35:40.055 --> 35:41.555
Here's to Sheriff Shelby.

35:44.643 --> 35:46.310
Oh, you got to like the sound of that.

35:46.394 --> 35:48.646
Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves here,
son.

35:48.730 --> 35:51.232
Oh, come on. No one's gonna vote
for that son of a bitch now.

35:51.316 --> 35:52.733
He's right, cousin Johnny.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.110
Harlan County elections ain't over
till the dead have voted.

35:55.237 --> 35:58.906
But I will allow, we've had a very good day.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.659
Baby, can I have a word?

36:01.743 --> 36:05.496
Yes, baby, right after we finish this round.
You want to join us?

36:05.580 --> 36:07.832
I'm good. And sooner's better.

36:09.459 --> 36:11.961
Well, sooner it is. Boys.

36:21.513 --> 36:25.641
Here? In that bar,

36:26.768 --> 36:29.061
where all them people are standing?

36:29.604 --> 36:32.106
Yeah, but you ain't got to worry about that,
because me and Ellen May,

36:32.190 --> 36:35.943
we cleaned up every drop.
We even got out stains been there 10 years.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.779
Where's Delroy now?

36:39.489 --> 36:43.284
Well, he's stinking up an old splinter shaft
out past Neary Holler.

36:47.497 --> 36:53.377
Well, Ava, I appreciate your thoroughness,
but now you understand that...

36:53.920 --> 36:56.463
Well, that Delroy was under our protection.

36:57.007 --> 36:59.884
I know, but buying protection
doesn't entitle him

36:59.968 --> 37:02.636
to bring his mess to our front door like that.

37:03.305 --> 37:05.848
And, Boyd, you didn't see Ellen May.

37:06.850 --> 37:11.520
She was scared. She was scared
as a jackrabbit running from a wildcat.

37:12.814 --> 37:15.691
You know what, baby? If that's the decision
you felt you needed to make,

37:16.401 --> 37:17.902
well, then I respect it.

37:18.778 --> 37:19.904
Good.

37:21.448 --> 37:25.951
'Cause I was also thinking,
in Delroy's absence,

37:27.120 --> 37:28.245
someone's gonna need to keep them girls

37:28.330 --> 37:30.331
from getting swallowed up
from some other animal.

37:30.624 --> 37:36.003
Well, now, that is very true.
But what about your "no whores" policy?

37:36.379 --> 37:37.588
Well, I wasn't talking about you.

37:38.256 --> 37:41.008
Oh, I'm sorry. Who were you talking about?

37:41.760 --> 37:42.968
Me.

37:46.473 --> 37:47.514
Hi.

37:47.807 --> 37:52.311
Ms. Dodd. Got something for you.
From Tanner.

37:59.903 --> 38:01.028
Thanks, Errol.

38:02.322 --> 38:04.156
If you need anything, will you let me know?

38:05.367 --> 38:06.492
I will.

38:09.371 --> 38:10.704
Thank you, Errol.

38:11.539 --> 38:12.706
You're welcome.

38:13.708 --> 38:14.833
Bye.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.469
Thank you, Imogene.

38:28.556 --> 38:29.974
I'm gonna let myself out the back.

38:34.187 --> 38:36.355
And I truly am sorry for your loss.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.413
<i>Why didn't you say grace?
Because he's bad?</i>

38:52.747 --> 38:54.081
<i>I simply forgot it, dear.</i>

38:54.332 --> 38:56.667
<i>Aren't you supposed to say grace
with bad people?</i>

38:59.087 --> 39:02.006
Marshal. Kitchen's closed,

39:02.090 --> 39:04.508
but I might could whip up something
if you're desperate.

39:04.592 --> 39:08.345
Closed, huh? Funny, I was just thinking
I might have to do the same thing.

39:08.972 --> 39:10.931
- What's that?
- Close you down.

39:11.141 --> 39:12.516
For what?

39:12.767 --> 39:17.604
I see to it myself, my kitchen's so clean that
the Virgin Mother herself would eat off of it.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.523
Ellstin, you think for a minute

39:19.607 --> 39:23.569
you could cut out that country-bumpkin,
barbecue-king bullshit?

39:23.653 --> 39:25.154
You'd rather talk pig shit?

39:25.447 --> 39:28.198
Close. Robert Quarles.

39:33.455 --> 39:35.372
That supposed to mean something to me?

39:35.457 --> 39:38.375
I'm either gonna put him in prison
or in the ground.

39:38.460 --> 39:41.962
Well, I'm sure you got your reasons,
Marshal. Not sure how I fit in.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.339
You're gonna help me.

39:44.424 --> 39:47.676
I would if I could, but like I said,
I don't know any Quarles.

39:47.761 --> 39:50.763
Quarles' point man in Harlan County
got blowed up today.

39:51.222 --> 39:55.976
A few hours later, I watched your boy Errol
pay the grieving mother.

39:57.270 --> 40:00.064
Tell me again
that you don't know Robert Quarles.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.443
- I'm sorry, Marshal. I lied to you.
- I know you did.

40:04.527 --> 40:08.113
No, not just now. I mean before, when I
said I did not remember your daddy.

40:08.198 --> 40:10.574
I do remember him.

40:10.658 --> 40:16.580
Truth is, I remember every shot I gave him,
the way his blood felt on my hands,

40:16.664 --> 40:19.500
the crying sound he made
when I was laying in on him,

40:19.584 --> 40:23.462
and just when the sound was about to stop,
he was on his way out,

40:23.546 --> 40:27.674
I was gonna finish him off
and looked up and saw you looking,

40:27.759 --> 40:30.677
eyes big as dollar coins.

40:31.221 --> 40:33.430
You was about to pee
down your little pants leg.

40:36.142 --> 40:41.814
Well, if you thought that memory
was gonna upset me, I'm sorry to disappoint.

40:42.398 --> 40:45.651
Well, if you like, I can tell you
what I remember about your mama.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.158
That would upset me.

41:02.127 --> 41:06.630
Ellstin, you must know
why Quarles is down here.

41:06.881 --> 41:11.468
There's a war coming. You really want to see
Nobles become a battleground?

41:12.595 --> 41:15.389
I appreciate your concern, Marshal.
I really do.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.810
But plenty of kings
have tried to lay claim on Nobles Holler,

41:19.894 --> 41:21.979
and none have ever succeeded.

41:22.063 --> 41:24.523
- Thanks to you and your family.
- That's right.

41:24.607 --> 41:28.277
That's what you're doing, huh?
Just protecting this holler?

41:29.404 --> 41:31.572
Right now, I'm just trying to close up
for the night.

41:34.242 --> 41:41.707
So be it.
