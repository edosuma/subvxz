WEBVTT

00:09.142 --> 00:11.378
You were having
a wee bit of a spats

00:11.444 --> 00:12.946
with your pal the other day.

00:12.979 --> 00:14.214
- You did it on purpose.
- No I never.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.049
- You did it on purpose!
- No I never!

00:16.116 --> 00:19.519
- You did it on purpose!
- No I nevers!

00:19.552 --> 00:21.554
- How're ya now.
- Can't you see

00:21.621 --> 00:24.224
- we're having a spat?
- That's a Texas-sized 10-4.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.393
Well, don't you feels compelled
?

00:26.459 --> 00:28.294
Well, people are allowed to
disagree and what have you.

00:28.328 --> 00:30.030
Well yeah, but usually when
we're having a spat

00:30.063 --> 00:32.032
- you intervene and all that.
-?

00:32.065 --> 00:36.302
Could you at least ask us what
the problems is?

00:36.336 --> 00:38.071
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:38.138 --> 00:39.973
Okay.

00:40.006 --> 00:41.241
'Kay.

00:45.311 --> 00:46.646
What's the problem?

00:46.679 --> 00:48.381
Katy's big tarts.
- What's that?

00:48.415 --> 00:50.083
Oh, I just love Katy's baked
tarts.

00:50.150 --> 00:53.920
Youse, uh... trying to provoke
me here?

00:53.987 --> 00:56.256
They're perfect.
Katy's got perfect tarts.

00:56.322 --> 00:58.224
I feel like youse know full well
what youse are doing.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.260
- I just love those tarts.
- So I've gathered.

01:00.326 --> 01:02.996
Mercy, those big, soft tarts
of hers.

01:03.029 --> 01:05.732
- So we crushed a tub of 'em.
- Did youse eat a whole tub?

01:05.765 --> 01:07.434
Well okay, there was two tubs,
and so we only crushed

01:07.500 --> 01:08.902
one of the tubs, so there's
still a tub left.

01:08.935 --> 01:10.570
There was fucking 19 to a tub.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.238
Neither of us is prouds about
eatins a whole tub.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.107
Well, I didn't see an empty tub
on the counter.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.776
Well, that's because we washed
and dried and put away the tub

01:16.843 --> 01:18.511
so that you wouldn't've seen
that we ate the tub.

01:18.545 --> 01:20.747
- Sneaky as the Dickens.
- So we get to the bottom

01:20.780 --> 01:23.450
of the tub and there's one left,
so we decide to split it.

01:23.516 --> 01:25.518
So Dan's gonna take a bite and
then hand me the other half.

01:25.552 --> 01:27.187
It's good of you to give him
the dividing bite.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.755
Well, that's what I thought it
was, too.

01:28.788 --> 01:31.357
I expressed my appreciations on
.

01:31.391 --> 01:33.026
And then he ate the whole thing!

01:33.059 --> 01:34.527
- You did not.
- It was on accident!

01:34.561 --> 01:37.197
- He did.
- You did n.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.966
- It was on accident!
- Yes he did do that to Darry!

01:40.033 --> 01:41.468
It was on accidents, Darrys!

01:41.534 --> 01:43.369
How do you accidentally eat a
full tart when

01:43.403 --> 01:44.871
you previously agreed to go
halves on the tart?

01:44.904 --> 01:46.606
- I'm gonna say!
- Well you can get saying!

01:46.639 --> 01:48.141
- Go on and say it!
- I'm gonna say!

01:48.208 --> 01:50.143
- Well you can get saying!
- Go on and say it!

01:50.210 --> 01:53.046
I'm gonna day, Darrys!

01:53.079 --> 01:55.048
So...

01:55.081 --> 01:57.150
Katy's got those
big old tarts.

01:57.217 --> 02:00.620
- Come off it.
- I mean, Lord, I'd have one

02:00.653 --> 02:02.622
of them tarts down my gullet all
hours of the day if I could.

02:02.655 --> 02:05.058
Ah, I'm just dreaming of Katy's
big ol' tarts in my hands.

02:05.091 --> 02:06.659
Move... fuckin' onwards.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.328
So I goes to takes the dividing
bites of the tarts,

02:08.394 --> 02:10.296
and the other half of the tart
just crumbles

02:10.330 --> 02:11.431
right theres in my hands!

02:11.464 --> 02:13.066
- That'll happen.
- So it's either let

02:13.099 --> 02:15.001
the crumbled half just fall
right there on the floor

02:15.068 --> 02:16.402
or I just hoover up
the other halfs!

02:16.436 --> 02:17.804
You know I eat stuff off
the floor!

02:17.837 --> 02:19.172
You know that I eat stuff
off the floor!

02:19.239 --> 02:20.740
Darry's always eating thing off
the floor.

02:20.773 --> 02:22.408
He's right! I'm always eating
things up off the floor!

02:22.442 --> 02:24.077
Surprised he isn't eating
something off the floor

02:24.110 --> 02:25.178
right now.

02:25.245 --> 02:26.579
It's not my fault the tarts
crumbled.

02:26.613 --> 02:28.581
- Tarts crumbles all the time.
- Almost every day.

02:28.615 --> 02:30.250
I mean, I was just as surprised
as everyone,

02:30.283 --> 02:32.352
'cause you know that Katy's
ta.

02:32.418 --> 02:34.420
You coulda' put the tub
unde!

02:34.454 --> 02:37.090
We'd already washed and dried
and put away the tub, Darry!

02:37.123 --> 02:39.159
Sneaky as the Dickens!

02:39.192 --> 02:41.094
That doesn't change that I still
eat things off the floor!

02:41.127 --> 02:42.595
I always eat things off
the floor,

02:42.629 --> 02:44.164
and I'm never backing down
from that. Never!

02:44.197 --> 02:45.632
Hey, gents.

02:52.639 --> 02:54.774
Where's this end?

03:05.718 --> 03:08.354
Does anyone want the other half
of this?

03:08.388 --> 03:11.224
I believes my good buddy
Darry's woulds.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.825
Hey, thanks, good buddy,

03:15.461 --> 03:17.397
It's just too much.

03:17.463 --> 03:19.465
Why are my tarts so big?

03:21.401 --> 03:23.903
- DAN/
Makes them perfect
for sharings with a pal.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.138
Come off it!

03:37.684 --> 03:41.221
Schmellies. If he needs a hand,
I'm happy to lend one.

03:41.254 --> 03:42.889
Just as long as his daughters
aren't there.

03:42.922 --> 03:44.657
What, you got something against
daughters, Darry?

03:44.691 --> 03:46.593
Well, just those daughters in
particular.

03:46.659 --> 03:49.362
Ain't much wrong with
the sisters though, eh?

03:55.702 --> 03:58.671
Hello unto ye.

03:58.705 --> 04:01.007
He's a bit spooked
this glorious day.

04:01.040 --> 04:04.844
Best I stroke this big Dyck 'til
he calms once. There.

04:08.848 --> 04:11.718
Almost there. There.

04:13.286 --> 04:16.122
What a miraculous day the Lord
hath made.

04:16.189 --> 04:19.759
Let us be glad and rejoice for
he is inside all of us.

04:19.792 --> 04:21.628
Noah, how are you now?

04:21.694 --> 04:24.030
"Noah" worse off than the next
guy, I suppose.

04:25.398 --> 04:27.033
Daniel!
- I haven't seen ye in--

04:27.066 --> 04:29.469
The age of dog once, yep.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.537
- Darryl.
- What can we do for you?

04:33.373 --> 04:36.776
Wayne, your community has always
used us right. Hopefully--

04:36.809 --> 04:38.711
You feel as though
we've used you right.

04:38.745 --> 04:41.147
- Once.
- You said it at least twice.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.548
- Twice once?
- Eh, at least twice.

04:42.582 --> 04:44.550
- Least twice once?
- Twice or more.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.219
- Not once or twice once?
- At least twice.

04:46.252 --> 04:48.721
- Twice or more once.
- Can confirm.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.790
Wayne, you've been a great
friend unto me

04:50.823 --> 04:52.158
for many years now.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.559
- Okay.
- For banging the boxes

04:53.593 --> 04:55.828
summer last, I feel the great
need deep within me

04:55.895 --> 04:58.064
to repay you
for the kindnesses shown,

04:58.097 --> 04:59.899
the very best way I know how.

04:59.932 --> 05:02.068
- Oh, here we go.
- Well, how's that?

05:02.101 --> 05:05.071
With a sausage party!
- Wait, first a box hammer,

05:05.104 --> 05:06.639
- and now...
A which?

05:06.673 --> 05:09.409
- A sausage party.
- Well,.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.477
I've spent the majority of mine
adult life

05:11.511 --> 05:13.313
stuffing my meat into casings.

05:13.346 --> 05:15.081
It's thrilling work, rewarding
and exhausting,

05:15.114 --> 05:18.918
yet I won't rest until my
sausage has touched

05:18.951 --> 05:20.920
the back of your throats.

05:20.953 --> 05:23.356
- Well, I do's loves sausages.
- Me too.

05:23.423 --> 05:25.692
Like, I love it so much.

05:25.758 --> 05:27.360
I'd feel a bit better if we
could bring a date.

05:27.427 --> 05:30.930
Ah, I'm afraid there's only one
rule at a sausage party.

05:30.963 --> 05:32.498
No women allowed.

05:32.532 --> 05:35.268
Okay, so he meant literally
as well as figuratively.

05:35.301 --> 05:36.936
Are your daughters
going to be around?

05:36.969 --> 05:39.772
Not today. They're having
a party with mine wife

05:39.806 --> 05:42.175
- in our very own kitchen.
- That's a good thing.

05:42.208 --> 05:46.779
Besides, a sausage party is
a .

05:46.813 --> 05:48.614
off a little steam.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.550
I'm not sure we can make it,
Noah.

05:50.616 --> 05:53.353
Darryl, you silly gosling!
I h!

05:53.386 --> 05:55.888
- Right. Shoot.
- It's today!

05:55.955 --> 05:58.791
- We'll be there.
- I love sausages.

05:58.825 --> 06:00.460
Me too. Like, it's so god.

06:00.493 --> 06:02.061
What goes on at a sausage party?

06:02.128 --> 06:03.896
Well, Darryl, it sounds like
it's a party

06:03.963 --> 06:05.631
where guys eats a lot of
sausages.

06:05.665 --> 06:07.367
Like, literally,
a sausages party.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.469
But also it's a dudes-only
party,

06:09.502 --> 06:11.704
so figuratively it's a sausages
party as well.

06:11.738 --> 06:14.807
Daniel, I must confess,
you are testing the limits

06:14.841 --> 06:16.976
of my one-room schoolhouse
education

06:17.009 --> 06:18.978
with all those fancy words.

06:19.011 --> 06:21.981
I know that Mennonites aren't
exactly known for having

06:22.014 --> 06:23.583
a wagon-load of grey matter.

06:23.649 --> 06:25.251
But fuck can they run...

06:25.318 --> 06:28.187
Still, I do wish I could give
mine children great brain.

06:30.356 --> 06:33.760
Alas, it's of no matter.
So what sayeth ye?

06:33.826 --> 06:36.329
I won't take "Noah"
for an answer.

06:36.362 --> 06:38.564
- So no daughters?
- No, not on this day.

06:38.598 --> 06:40.566
- What about sisters?
- Daniel, time will tell.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.771
By the looks of the sun,
it's fast approaching noon.

06:44.837 --> 06:47.774
- It's 3 pm.
- I'd best.

06:50.777 --> 06:53.112
It's as much for your benefit
as mine.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.114
For ye haven't truly lived

06:55.181 --> 06:57.550
until you've had Dyck meat
in your mouth.

07:11.397 --> 07:13.533
- Bugs and Daffy.
- Stewart!

07:13.566 --> 07:15.034
The fuck are you vampires
doing here?

07:15.067 --> 07:18.371
This is where we get...
dirty.

07:18.404 --> 07:19.972
What are you doing here?

07:20.039 --> 07:22.842
The supplement store...
is that way.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.112
I didn't know Letterkenny had
a supplement store.

07:26.145 --> 07:27.880
Where?

07:27.914 --> 07:31.484
Yeah, uh... you know the bridge
by the Kinsmen pool

07:31.551 --> 07:33.719
- that goes over top of the dam?
Yeah.

07:33.753 --> 07:36.222
Oh, just walk halfway across it
and jump off.

07:36.255 --> 07:37.723
Stewart!

07:37.757 --> 07:40.293
I never noticed a supplement
store there, buddy.

07:40.326 --> 07:41.961
- Let's look on our way back.
- Yeah.

07:41.994 --> 07:44.464
I'm gonna buy the Dynamic
Stimulant free core

07:44.497 --> 07:45.965
- slimming complex.
- Nice.

07:45.998 --> 07:47.567
I'm out of my Nexo Bionic extra
strength

07:47.600 --> 07:49.168
advanced multi-probiotic.

07:49.235 --> 07:50.636
- Bet you they have it.
- I hope so.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.238
- On your way back where?
- Play Chel.

07:52.271 --> 07:54.674
- My crib's around the corner.
- Your mom's crib--

07:54.740 --> 07:58.411
Roald!
You wanna rip some Chel?

07:58.444 --> 08:00.313
Roll up.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.181
- Sure. Yeah.
- Cool.

08:02.248 --> 08:04.917
But yo, let's actually stop by
that suppy store

08:04.951 --> 08:07.086
on the way home.
I'm out of my amino nitrate

08:07.119 --> 08:10.590
sodium bicarbonate beta alanine
creatine with BCAAs.

08:10.623 --> 08:12.692
Sick! I'm out of my amino acid
up and recovery

08:12.758 --> 08:16.162
3-in-1 macro tracking exogenic
ketones.

08:16.195 --> 08:17.830
- Bet you they have it.
- I hope so!

08:17.864 --> 08:20.700
Don't forget you
Flintsto)

08:20.766 --> 08:23.936
- Wilma's my favourite flavour!
- I prefer Fred.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.638
Noted.

08:33.813 --> 08:36.115
Sausage seekers! Ye came!

08:36.148 --> 08:37.617
Well, it woulda been rudes
not to.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.452
- Half rude.
- You don'.

08:39.485 --> 08:40.520
I wasn't half rude.

08:40.553 --> 08:41.787
Well, not coming would be whole
rude.

08:41.821 --> 08:43.322
Well, in which case,
I'd rather be half rude.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.124
- You never wanna be half rude.
- Well, I wasn't half rude.

08:45.157 --> 08:46.659
Good. 'Cause you don't wanna
be half rude.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.962
I must confess, my first batch
of sausages did not turn out

08:49.996 --> 08:52.298
to the usual Dyck standards.

08:52.331 --> 08:56.135
Shameful, but I blew a load
right here in the yard.

08:56.168 --> 08:58.971
Luckily mine daughters were here
to clean it up

08:59.005 --> 09:01.307
and even eat what could be
salvaged.

09:01.340 --> 09:06.045
What a treat it was to watch my
own children enjoy my load,

09:06.078 --> 09:08.047
despite its premature
completion.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.483
Even the dog wandered over and
began to suck up the excess--

09:10.516 --> 09:12.485
Good enough!

09:12.518 --> 09:17.456
Praise be, this next batch will
remain firmly in my hands.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.262
Breathe deeply.

09:26.699 --> 09:30.336
For the air is thick with
the sweet scent of Dyck meat.

09:30.369 --> 09:34.340
Come! Let us gather by the fire
and devour endless sausages

09:34.373 --> 09:36.909
with our mouths together
as men.

09:36.943 --> 09:39.345
I don't care how gross
you makes it sound.

09:39.378 --> 09:41.948
Leads me to that meats.
Is Lavinas on the properties?

09:42.014 --> 09:43.749
Time will soon tell, Daniel.

09:43.783 --> 09:46.686
By the looks of the sun, why,
it's almost afternoon.

09:46.719 --> 09:48.854
- It's evening.
- Trust.

09:48.888 --> 09:51.023
My sausages will remove all
thoughts of women.

09:51.057 --> 09:52.625
I care how gross
he makes it sound.

09:52.692 --> 09:54.193
What'd I tell you about being
half rude?

09:54.226 --> 09:56.195
- Well, I wasn't half rude.
- .

09:56.228 --> 09:57.363
Well, I wasn't half rude.

09:57.396 --> 09:59.031
Hey, what's your favourite
football movie?

09:59.065 --> 10:01.434
- Rudy.
- Is it really?

10:01.467 --> 10:03.302
I would've thought you said
Varsity Blues.

10:13.746 --> 10:16.215
-
- You fucker!

10:24.924 --> 10:26.659
- Spellbinding!
- Hot.

10:26.726 --> 10:27.793
Breathtaking.

10:27.827 --> 10:30.396
I'm gonna come on my coveralls,
Stewart!

10:31.597 --> 10:33.132
Have you ever seen such
primitive emotion?

10:33.165 --> 10:34.400
Primal.

10:34.433 --> 10:36.736
I think it's called
"toxic masculinity."

10:36.769 --> 10:39.071
Oh, gonna fucking gack me up
with it.

10:39.105 --> 10:41.307
Gack all over me with it.

10:46.445 --> 10:47.913
This isn't fair, buddy!

10:47.947 --> 10:49.849
You had home ice advantage, bro!

10:49.915 --> 10:52.418
We're taking the Chel station
back to our billet mom's,

10:52.451 --> 10:56.355
- and you can play us there!
- On our home ice this time!

10:56.422 --> 10:59.425
- Let's go, Reilly!
- Let's go, Jonesy!

10:59.458 --> 11:01.127
Fuck!

11:05.598 --> 11:08.100
Did they just invite us over?

11:08.134 --> 11:10.936
- I'm glad they had fun.
-

11:12.938 --> 11:16.342
Before our sausage party begins,
let us take a moment

11:16.375 --> 11:19.879
to thank the good Lord for this
"meat-up".

11:19.945 --> 11:21.614
Join hands.

11:21.647 --> 11:25.384
I'll links for links.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.020
Lord, we thank ye for
the beautiful bounty

11:28.054 --> 11:30.690
ye hath bestowed on us this
glorious day.

11:30.723 --> 11:34.026
Bless this meal as to thy
ser.

11:34.060 --> 11:38.130
We pray this for Jesus' sake.
Amen.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.032
That wasn't so bad.

11:40.066 --> 11:43.469
Okay, now... pork.

11:43.502 --> 11:45.404
The aroma doth make
the mouth water.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.473
You wanna know what,
it really does.

11:47.506 --> 11:50.409
Kinda reminds me of the Kinsmen
barbeque from last year.

11:50.476 --> 11:53.479
Yeah.
You got MVG.

11:53.512 --> 11:56.248
- Yeah.
- Most Valuable Griller.

11:56.315 --> 11:58.984
Ah, put it on a t-shirt for me,
thought that was pretty neat.

11:59.018 --> 12:01.821
Wayne, for mercy's sake,
at least give me a chance

12:01.854 --> 12:03.322
to beat your meat.

12:03.355 --> 12:05.091
'Kay.

12:05.157 --> 12:07.226
Well, that's a relief.
Some help serving?

12:07.259 --> 12:09.562
- It'd be my pleasures.
- I always say,

12:09.595 --> 12:11.897
there's only two things a man
needs in life.

12:11.931 --> 12:15.234
Sausage and spit.
Why, I e

12:15.267 --> 12:17.503
every opportunity I get.

12:17.536 --> 12:22.174
Daniel, my wife constructed
a smoker for us.

12:22.208 --> 12:25.377
Won't ye do me the honours of
parting her meat curtains?

12:30.382 --> 12:32.585
-
- Oh...

12:40.726 --> 12:44.263
You tricked the cards!
Tricked the cards!

12:44.296 --> 12:45.965
- Ex-squeeze me?

12:46.031 --> 12:48.200
- You tricked the cards!
- You mean, like,

12:48.234 --> 12:50.703
- "stacked the deck?"
- He admits it! He admits it!

12:50.736 --> 12:53.539
You downloaded some funky
dark web shit onto your system

12:53.572 --> 12:54.974
and that's why you dummied us!

12:55.040 --> 12:56.942
You speed-bagged us, boys!

12:56.976 --> 12:59.044
You fucking... rigged all this!

12:59.078 --> 13:01.046
- How dare you?
- Stewart.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.283
How dare you accuse us of using
the... dark web

13:04.316 --> 13:05.951
to gain a gaming
competitive edge!

13:05.985 --> 13:08.821
That is a one-way ticket
to C.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.890
Have you guys been drinking
Chel-o shooters?

13:10.923 --> 13:12.158
How dare you.

13:12.224 --> 13:13.793
'Cause you're acting like a
bunch of children.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.161
- How dare you!

13:15.227 --> 13:17.563
It's one bombshell after another
in this rumpus room!

13:17.596 --> 13:20.900
Let me give it to you in
a nut-Chel.

13:20.933 --> 13:23.736
We are through walking on
egg-Chels with the two of you.

13:23.769 --> 13:26.138
Perhaps you pick up some
beta blockers

13:26.172 --> 13:28.741
- at the supplement store.
- Yeah, take a Chel pill.

13:28.774 --> 13:29.742
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

13:29.775 --> 13:30.843
Just don't forget where it is.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.078
Just walk halfway across
the bridge,

13:33.112 --> 13:36.582
overtop of the dam,
and jump off!

13:36.615 --> 13:40.019
- Let's go, Roald.
- Yeah, let's go, Roald.

13:41.420 --> 13:42.721
Thank you.

13:51.797 --> 13:53.365
- Huh?
- Huh?

13:56.635 --> 13:58.704
First let's start with
the wurst.

13:58.771 --> 14:01.340
- Oh, I gots a thirst for wurst.
-

14:01.373 --> 14:04.276
I've been known to show
a kielbasa who's boss-ah.

14:06.645 --> 14:09.281
Charcuterie-style mettwurst.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.450
Soft, moist,
melts in the mouth once.

14:11.483 --> 14:12.952
You don't have to tell me twice.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.733
Bratwurst. Coarse, juicy.

14:27.800 --> 14:29.468
Made from pork.

14:29.501 --> 14:32.071
Pork, you say?
Excuse me's for pigging outs.

14:46.185 --> 14:47.386
Knackwurst.

14:47.419 --> 14:50.489
Pork and garlic,
often highly seasoned.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.491
Well, never so bad
it couldn't be wurst.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.606
Weisswurst.

15:07.673 --> 15:09.775
These... wurst...

15:13.512 --> 15:16.615
Hey, Noah, which sausage makes
the funniest sounds?

15:16.682 --> 15:19.018
Why, I don't know, Daniel.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.619
Frankfarters.

15:23.055 --> 15:26.425
Uh-oh! This one looks like
a franksquirter.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.708
- Stewart.
- Mary-Kate.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.376
- Roald.
- Ashley.

15:44.410 --> 15:47.546
Um, this is your Chel station
from when we booked it

15:47.579 --> 15:49.081
out of your house earlier.

15:52.084 --> 15:53.886
Um, this is your Chel
station from when

15:53.919 --> 15:55.754
we booked it out of your house
earlier.

15:59.758 --> 16:02.227
- Get over here!
- Whoop!

16:02.261 --> 16:06.065
Um, anyway, you were right to
'chel' us off earlier.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.833
Oh?

16:07.900 --> 16:10.502
Yeah, we... we deserved it,
boys.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.171
Guess we thought we were
better at that game

16:12.237 --> 16:13.472
than we actually are.

16:13.505 --> 16:15.808
You are no
Alexander Graham Chel.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.743
-
- Do you know who that is?

16:17.776 --> 16:19.745
I don't know who that is.

16:19.778 --> 16:22.648
We don't know who that is,
but I dunno,

16:22.681 --> 16:26.318
we just wanted to say something
like... sorry.

16:26.352 --> 16:29.855
- Yeah, like, we regret it.
- Why?

16:29.922 --> 16:32.358
You gotta be able to take
the.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.994
It doesn't matter if it's Chel
or the National League, boys.

16:35.027 --> 16:37.763
don't get too
high, don't get too low.

16:37.796 --> 16:39.832
- Too high.
- Too high!

16:39.865 --> 16:42.768
Gotta approach life with
a playoff mentality, boys.

16:42.801 --> 16:44.870
- So...

16:44.937 --> 16:47.206
- Later.
-

16:47.272 --> 16:48.807
- Stewart!
- Yo!

16:51.643 --> 16:52.978
Where you heading?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.214
We were gonna go check out that
new supplement store

16:55.280 --> 16:56.615
you were telling us about

16:56.648 --> 16:58.450
-
- I don't know what to do.

16:58.484 --> 17:00.452
I don't know what to do either.

17:00.486 --> 17:03.055
You guys, uh, ever play FIF'.

17:03.122 --> 17:06.392
You ever, uh, FIF-it?

17:06.458 --> 17:09.294
Yeah, I've sampled
the FIF' brisket.

17:09.328 --> 17:11.630
- FIF-ing it real?
- Commander in FIF.

17:11.663 --> 17:14.199
Two things we do not
joke around about.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.069
Schneef and FIF'.

17:17.136 --> 17:20.072
Let's say we turn over a new
FIF'.

17:20.139 --> 17:21.807
- Shotty Brazil!
- We'll go check out

17:21.840 --> 17:23.475
that supplement store another
time, buddy.

17:23.509 --> 17:25.044
Supplement store is going
nowhere, bro!

17:25.077 --> 17:27.246
Ninja dust!

17:39.758 --> 17:41.427
Delicious.

17:41.493 --> 17:43.062
That's not so bad, is it, Darry?

17:43.095 --> 17:45.264
Key to the day was
the daughters away.

17:45.330 --> 17:47.232
I wouldn't've minded seeing
the sisters, though.

17:49.535 --> 17:51.437
Oh, pardon me, brethren.

17:51.503 --> 17:54.406
I just had
my funny bone jerked.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.910
Not sure I've had my bone jerked
quite that hard before.

17:57.943 --> 18:00.446
- But in speaking of daughters--
- No.

18:00.512 --> 18:02.347
- And of sisters...
- Yes.

18:02.381 --> 18:05.350
- It's time... to come inside.
- Why?

18:06.852 --> 18:09.555
Well, that's where the Dyck
suckers are.

18:11.557 --> 18:12.958
I don't want to go in there.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.593
Well, fine, I'll bring them
out here.

18:14.626 --> 18:18.197
Charity Dyck! Chastity Dyck!
Anita Dyck!

18:20.065 --> 18:21.700
Ah, my little Dyck suckers.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.538
Charity is leading Bible study
.

18:26.572 --> 18:27.906
Darryl.

18:32.911 --> 18:36.748
Sweetest, stickiest treat
a man could ever eat.

18:39.751 --> 18:41.286
Our sap runneth over.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.955
- Daniel.
- Lavinas.

18:42.988 --> 18:45.390
Judging by the sun, it's just
past suppertime.

18:45.424 --> 18:47.226
- This is correct.
- Dessert?

18:47.259 --> 18:49.228
Please and thank yous.

18:49.261 --> 18:51.330
Can I interest any of yous in
some Dyck milk?

18:51.396 --> 18:53.232
No thank you.

18:53.265 --> 18:56.135
Don't be shy. We have an awful
lot of it.

18:56.168 --> 18:59.338
In fact, enough to make a long
hot summer of Dyck cheese.

19:09.181 --> 19:11.250
Oh, I do love your Dyck cheese.
