00:52.928 --> 00:56.547
<i>Lieutenant Joe Kennedy, Jr.,
the eldest son of former ambassador...</i>

00:57.140 --> 00:59.883
<i>...died instantly,
after the plane he was piloting exploded</i>

00:59.977 --> 01:01.388
<i>during a mission over the North Sea.</i>

01:01.478 --> 01:03.640
<i>President Kennedy was shot</i>

01:03.730 --> 01:06.848
<i>as he drove from Dallas airport
to downtown Dallas.</i>

01:07.317 --> 01:10.560
<i>...an ambulance, and the car rushed to...</i>

01:10.654 --> 01:12.520
<i>Bobby Kennedy was shot</i>

01:12.614 --> 01:15.527
<i>at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles.</i>

01:21.623 --> 01:22.864
<i>Senator Edward Kennedy,</i>

01:22.958 --> 01:25.371
<i>the only one of the four brothers
left alive...</i>

01:25.460 --> 01:26.996
<i>Teddy Kennedy would most certainly</i>

01:27.087 --> 01:29.921
<i>be the candidate to beat
in the next presidential election.</i>

01:30.007 --> 01:31.293
<i>But will he run?</i>

01:31.383 --> 01:33.500
<i>That's the question. Will Ted Kennedy run?</i>

01:39.766 --> 01:41.098
<i>Senator, can I get you anything?</i>

01:41.643 --> 01:42.804
<i>No, thank you.</i>

01:43.312 --> 01:46.430
- <i>Roll sound.</i>
- <i>Okay, roll camera.</i>

01:49.901 --> 01:51.358
- Are you all set, Senator?
- Yes, Bob.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.686
Great.

01:57.159 --> 01:59.776
<i>"We choose to go
to the moon, not because it is easy,</i>

02:00.120 --> 02:01.486
<i>but because it is hard."</i>

02:02.831 --> 02:05.448
<i>What does your brother's
promise to America mean to you?</i>

02:07.127 --> 02:10.086
Well, he was always someone
who kept his promises.

02:10.672 --> 02:14.131
My brother committed his life
to the idea that

02:14.217 --> 02:17.255
the United States is
a beacon of democracy.

02:18.847 --> 02:22.306
<i>And so too for my family,
I think he was a beacon.</i>

02:23.060 --> 02:24.722
<i>Someone we all hoped to look up to.</i>

02:25.979 --> 02:27.265
<i>I know I sure did.</i>

02:28.357 --> 02:31.065
<i>He said this mission
would have, quote,</i>

02:31.151 --> 02:34.315
"a great impact on the minds
of the men across America."

02:34.404 --> 02:37.397
I think my brother set
a course for the entire nation

02:37.491 --> 02:39.073
in a way that we can never abandon.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.738
You see it in the space program, sure.

02:42.788 --> 02:45.246
<i>But even in my own life,
I often ask myself,</i>

02:46.416 --> 02:48.749
"What would Jack have me do?"

02:49.961 --> 02:52.874
<i>President Kennedy bast
a long shadow and still does.</i>

02:52.964 --> 02:55.707
<i>It's one I walk in every day.</i>

02:57.094 --> 02:59.381
What's it like walking in that shadow?

03:14.695 --> 03:15.526
<i>Senator?</i>

03:17.656 --> 03:20.490
I think you have what you need, Bob.
Thank you very much.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.237
- Thanks for your time.
- All right, cut.

03:22.661 --> 03:23.822
- Bob.
- Senator.

03:23.912 --> 03:24.868
Pleasure.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.487
Do we have Joe yet?

03:26.581 --> 03:29.039
I was a little more focused
on salvaging our relationship

03:29.126 --> 03:29.991
with the majority leader.

03:30.419 --> 03:31.910
You're worried about the wrong thing.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.162
Come on. Mansfield's smart enough to know

03:34.256 --> 03:36.088
Ted's gonna be his boss in three years.

03:36.174 --> 03:37.164
Well, do we have him?

03:37.259 --> 03:39.342
<i>Yes. Mr. Gargan is on hold for you now.</i>

03:39.428 --> 03:40.259
<i>You're connected.</i>

03:40.345 --> 03:42.553
What's going on, Teddy?
I've been on hold here for 10 minutes.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.005
<i>Well, I really needed
to talk to you.</i>

03:44.099 --> 03:46.682
Well, it must be something
really damn important.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.680
The hotel in the Vineyard is overbooked.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.261
<i>What are you talking about?
I just checked us in.</i>

03:50.355 --> 03:52.062
<i>- I got the key in my pocket right now.</i>
- No.

03:52.149 --> 03:54.607
No. Not our room, the girls' room.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.059
<i>- They just balled.</i>
- Oh, come on.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.360
They ran Bobby's campaign, Teddy.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.903
I'm sure they can sort it out
for themselves.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.322
<i>Joey, they don't know the island.
I need this handled properly.</i>

04:01.408 --> 04:04.196
Well, what do you want me to do?
Slap an injunction on the desk clerk

04:04.286 --> 04:05.993
<i>- until he boughs up a room?</i>
- I don't need my lawyer.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.991
I need my cousin. I need my advance man.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.789
I gotta rig the boat, Teddy.
The regatta's this afternoon.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.742
I know when the race is.
I'm sailing the damn boat with you.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.499
And I'm still getting the cottage
organized for the party.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.875
Joey, there is no party
without the Boiler Room Girls.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.208
<i>All right, I'll see what I ban do,
but I can't just jump in...</i>

04:20.302 --> 04:23.090
Listen, listen, listen.
Ol' Joey will fix it, right?

04:24.598 --> 04:26.715
You know, when your dad said that,
it was a compliment.

04:26.808 --> 04:29.516
When my dad said that,
he said I could always count on you.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.886
Now, can I count on you?

04:33.815 --> 04:35.932
Yeah. Sure.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.109
- Ol' Joey will fix it.
<i>- That's great.</i>

04:38.195 --> 04:39.982
All right, I'll see you soon.

04:40.071 --> 04:43.690
<i>Three, two, one, zero.</i>

04:43.784 --> 04:47.949
<i>All engines running.
Liftoff. We have a liftoff.</i>

04:48.038 --> 04:51.952
<i>Thirty-two minutes past the hour.
Liftoff on Apollo 11.</i>

04:55.045 --> 04:56.752
<i>Apollo 11 is on the way.</i>

04:56.838 --> 05:01.128
<i>Riding that pillar of flame,
into the skies out there,</i>

05:01.218 --> 05:03.631
<i>250,000 miles away,</i>

05:03.720 --> 05:07.839
<i>where the moon is waiting
for man's first arrival.</i>

05:08.475 --> 05:10.717
<i>Flight to take three days,</i>

05:10.811 --> 05:15.681
<i>and the spacecraft
to reach there on Saturday.</i>

05:15.774 --> 05:17.857
<i>The landing to take place on Sunday,</i>

05:17.943 --> 05:20.856
<i>and Neil Armstrong to set foot on the moon</i>

05:20.946 --> 05:24.530
<i>at 2:21 a.m. on Monday morning.</i>

05:24.616 --> 05:28.326
<i>The first critical phase
of this flight is over, the launch.</i>

05:28.411 --> 05:29.527
<i>They're now in Earth orbit.</i>

05:29.621 --> 05:34.241
<i>They are now over the Atlantic
approaching the coast of Africa.</i>

05:34.334 --> 05:37.668
<i>In touch shortly with
the Canary tracking station,</i>

05:37.754 --> 05:39.461
<i>we may hear some more from them,</i>

05:39.548 --> 05:42.086
<i>and then out over Africa,
the Indian Ocean,</i>

05:42.175 --> 05:45.509
<i>past Australia, back around
for the first trip...</i>

06:46.990 --> 06:48.026
Did he ask?

06:49.409 --> 06:50.900
Did he hint in any way?

06:53.121 --> 06:55.329
Even if he did, do you really
think I would tell you?

06:55.415 --> 06:57.623
I've kept bigger secrets.

07:00.879 --> 07:03.462
Hmm. I'll take that as a yes.

07:05.050 --> 07:08.134
You're brilliant, Mary Jo,
and you're available.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.132
There is no reason
why he wouldn't want you.

07:13.058 --> 07:14.640
Considering my options.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.264
- That's a surprise.
- Why?

07:17.354 --> 07:19.641
Last time we talked,
you said you'd never go back.

07:20.649 --> 07:23.141
- To Washington?
- To politics.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.528
With Bobby it was different.

07:29.074 --> 07:31.782
It didn't feel like politics.
It felt like public service.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.403
And after he was gone, I...

07:40.085 --> 07:44.375
Anyway, yes, Ted asked,
and I'm thinking about it.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.332
Well, you're thinking too hard.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.133
How is he doing?

07:49.594 --> 07:52.803
He just became the youngest
majority whip in U.S. history.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.468
Pretty good, I'd say.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.642
Trading state secrets is
an act of treason, you know.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.891
Hello, Senator.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.050
Good to see you, Rachel.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.935
- Mary Jo.
- Senator.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.739
How are the kids, Senator?

08:12.826 --> 08:14.408
Fine. Yeah, just fine.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.985
And your wife?

08:16.079 --> 08:18.822
She's at home on bed rest, I'm afraid.

08:18.915 --> 08:19.996
Yeah, it was doctor's orders.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.163
Well, I think I'm gonna go for a swim.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.836
- Are you coming?
- Maybe later.

08:27.924 --> 08:30.166
Good luck in the race
this afternoon, Senator.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.296
Thank you.

08:37.976 --> 08:38.966
<i>Thanks for coming.</i>

08:40.687 --> 08:42.974
It's a reunion. Why wouldn't I?

08:46.401 --> 08:49.769
Did you consider my offer?

08:52.741 --> 08:54.073
It'll never be the same.

08:54.743 --> 08:57.577
You can't hide in Jersey City forever.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.539
Come back to Washington, work on my staff.

09:04.502 --> 09:07.415
- Too many memories there.
- Build new ones.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.217
I don't think I could handle
another presidential campaign.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.305
I...

09:21.269 --> 09:24.888
I don't... know if you'll have to.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.527
- At my mark...
- Drop the chute, Teddy!

09:39.621 --> 09:40.907
Senator, they have right of way.

09:40.997 --> 09:41.987
Trim it! Trim it!

09:42.082 --> 09:44.415
- We're gonna clear them!
- I'm coming up!

09:45.085 --> 09:47.077
Joey, call it out!

09:47.462 --> 09:49.545
Ten boat lengths, Teddy.
We gotta drop the spinnaker.

09:49.631 --> 09:50.872
Not yet!

09:51.466 --> 09:53.332
Teddy, come on! We gotta duck these guys.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.964
Joey, this boat's been in
my family longer than I have.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.761
If anyone knows how she handles, it's me.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.679
We gotta fall off
and let them overtake us.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.973
Are you kidding me, Teddy?

10:01.059 --> 10:02.971
- Drop the spinnaker!
- Not yet!

10:10.485 --> 10:11.771
God damn it!

10:14.739 --> 10:16.696
Good one, Ted!

10:45.436 --> 10:47.769
Hey! Hey! Here he is.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.518
It's the senator.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.017
Hey, everybody, come in here.
Get in here. Come on.

10:53.111 --> 10:56.775
Everybody, raise your glasses
to the senator.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.653
Ninth in the race,
but still first in our hearts.

10:59.742 --> 11:00.858
Hear, hear. Cheers.

11:00.952 --> 11:01.942
While we're raising glasses,

11:02.036 --> 11:04.824
we should raise a few more
for the Boiler Room Girls.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.031
- Quite right. Hear, hear.
- Absolutely.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.959
Uh, Rach, can you turn that down, please?

11:11.713 --> 11:15.297
Can someone please peel
the U.S. Attorney away from Nance Lyons?

11:15.383 --> 11:16.919
Come in, Nance.

11:19.137 --> 11:23.051
Come in, all of you. Just come in.
I want you all to hear this.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.299
Family.

11:25.977 --> 11:28.219
There's no more important word.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.392
Family is more than just a name.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.604
Joey Gargan and I don't share a name.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.145
We share a lifetime bond.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.238
We're family.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.609
We named you girls the Boiler Room Girls.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.829
I like to think
we called you that because,

11:47.415 --> 11:49.031
working on Bobby's campaign...

11:50.168 --> 11:52.535
he had such a fire in your bellies.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.629
Wanting to live up to the name
on that ticket.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.713
Wanting to prove yourselves
worthy of it...

12:01.346 --> 12:02.712
the Kennedy name.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.929
We miss him every day.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.095
His memory endures.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.394
His ideals will endure.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.434
And we will persevere,

12:17.528 --> 12:19.520
because that's what Kennedy's do.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.942
And I want you all to know that,

12:22.450 --> 12:25.363
because you're all part of
the Kennedy family now.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.780
To family.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.831
- To family.
- To family.

12:31.918 --> 12:35.377
And to Ted in the White House in '72.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.523
You should come up
to Boston this summer.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.350
We can take in a Red Sox game.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.232
I don't know.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.690
Come on, this could be our year.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.861
You say that every year, Joey.

13:05.952 --> 13:08.194
Yeah, but Yastrzemski's on fire.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.907
- I mean, really.
- Maybe. I'm actually running

13:12.000 --> 13:14.208
this campaign in Jersey City, so...

13:14.294 --> 13:16.536
We could head out to Hyannis.
Drop in on Ethel and the kids.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.087
I know she'd love to see you again.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.919
- How's she doing?
- She's great.

13:22.468 --> 13:26.337
She's running that charity
that she set up in Bobby's name.

13:26.431 --> 13:29.424
- Yeah, I know.
- So she's busy with that.

13:32.562 --> 13:36.272
She's a widow with 11 kids. It's rough.

13:36.733 --> 13:38.349
It's rough on the whole family.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.443
But, hey, what are you
doing wasting your talents on

13:42.530 --> 13:45.568
- a mayor's race in Jersey City?
- Excuse me. Sorry.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.367
Go Sox.

14:09.015 --> 14:11.632
<i>Houston, if you could comply,</i>

14:11.726 --> 14:14.560
<i>we'd like to see
little smiling faces up there.</i>

14:14.645 --> 14:16.011
<i>If you could give us some interior views,</i>

14:16.105 --> 14:19.473
<i>I'm sure everybody would
like to see you. Over.</i>

14:23.404 --> 14:25.896
My dad once said to me...

14:25.990 --> 14:28.232
..."Teddy, you can lead a serious life

14:28.326 --> 14:30.238
or you can lead a non-serious life.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.285
And I'll still love you
whichever choice you make.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.910
But if you choose to lead
a non-serious life,

14:34.999 --> 14:37.241
I just won't have much time for you."

14:39.629 --> 14:41.541
I can't believe he would say
something like that.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.757
No, it's okay. I was just a kid.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.924
What were you gonna say before?

14:55.520 --> 14:57.261
Before you were interrupted, about Bobby?

14:57.355 --> 14:59.221
Um... No, never mind.

14:59.315 --> 15:01.307
No, go on. You were gonna ask,

15:02.193 --> 15:03.775
after Bobby was killed...

15:06.114 --> 15:07.821
why didn't I run in his place?

15:11.577 --> 15:12.738
What would you have done?

15:13.454 --> 15:16.162
If you were me and he was your brother,
what would you have done?

15:19.585 --> 15:24.080
I'd quit, leave Washington,
never look back.

15:25.508 --> 15:27.249
Which is exactly what I did.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.883
But I'm not you. He wasn't my brother.

15:32.723 --> 15:35.887
Yeah, well, I had three generations
of advisors up my ass,

15:35.977 --> 15:37.388
trying to convince me to run.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.936
None of them listened to me.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.605
I mean, everyone tried to
convince me otherwise.

15:42.692 --> 15:45.184
Everyone except... Except Joey.

15:45.987 --> 15:47.444
Said the country needed me.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.230
They just needed my name.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.867
I wasn't ready.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.863
Could you ever be?

16:04.046 --> 16:07.665
Sometimes the path you're on
isn't always the path you choose.

16:08.759 --> 16:11.843
What's stopping you from
making that choice yourself?

16:18.102 --> 16:20.890
<i>We should get back.</i>

16:20.980 --> 16:23.688
<i>No. We should go to the beach.</i>

17:06.275 --> 17:07.265
Hey!

17:11.239 --> 17:13.696
- Hello!
- Ted.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.534
You folks having some car troubles?

18:00.288 --> 18:01.244
Teddy!

18:12.883 --> 18:14.715
<i>Mary Jo!</i>

18:15.845 --> 18:17.711
<i>Mary Jo!</i>

19:09.398 --> 19:12.106
So you must have sailed with Bobby too?

19:14.028 --> 19:16.270
Yeah. And Jack.

19:17.615 --> 19:20.153
Bobby's actually the one that
taught Teddy and me how to sail.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.576
I bet he was a great sailor.

19:23.704 --> 19:27.197
No. He actually wasn't.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.834
It's okay. I can say that sort of thing.
We're brothers.

19:32.588 --> 19:33.874
Nice try.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.419
Aren't you cousins or something?

19:38.344 --> 19:40.131
Yeah, but they adopted me.

19:41.806 --> 19:45.265
Yeah. You don't really look
like a Kennedy.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.722
<i>...the Command Module, a wonderful shot.</i>

19:48.813 --> 19:52.352
<i>At this point, they were
203,00a miles from the Earth.</i>

19:52.441 --> 19:54.854
<i>43,000 miles from the moon.</i>

20:00.616 --> 20:04.530
Get Joe Gargan.
We've got a problem.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.610
Sure, Ted.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.334
What the hell happened to you?

20:20.428 --> 20:22.135
You better get Paul too.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.885
Come on, Teddy, what's the big idea?

20:30.104 --> 20:32.221
I'm not gonna be president.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.959
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

20:55.045 --> 20:57.503
- Jesus, she's still in there?
- No, no, no. Paul.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.628
Showing back up at the party
in wet clothes will lessen our options.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.199
I can't get it open!
Can't swim with my knee.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.121
Then get up on the car
if you can't swim!

21:32.208 --> 21:33.744
I can't save us both.

21:36.837 --> 21:40.922
It's really dark down there.
I'm just going by feel.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.926
Joey, try the other side.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.548
Break a window or something.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.380
I already tried
breaking the window.

22:09.870 --> 22:14.706
Oh, my God, what have I done?
What have I done?

22:21.924 --> 22:24.166
She was already dead.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.373
What the hell happened, Teddy?

22:59.169 --> 23:02.082
You guys need to get me back to Edgartown.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.896
Teddy, listen to me.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.269
The only advice I have for you, and...

23:22.359 --> 23:25.272
And I say this to you not as your friend,

23:25.362 --> 23:28.025
not as your family, but as your lawyer...

23:29.158 --> 23:31.946
you gotta report this thing
and you've gotta do it right now.

23:34.038 --> 23:35.495
Joey's right, Senator.

23:35.915 --> 23:39.124
You got the U.S. Attorney of Massachusetts
saying the same thing.

23:41.337 --> 23:44.250
All right, I'll report it.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.963
Where the hell
are you going, Teddy?

23:57.519 --> 23:59.852
Paul, turn the car off.

24:02.691 --> 24:05.434
Ted! What are you doing?

24:07.154 --> 24:09.737
Do we even know whose boat that is?

24:25.673 --> 24:26.629
Hey.

24:28.384 --> 24:31.001
You're gonna survive, okay?

24:33.722 --> 24:36.135
Teddy, promise me you're gonna
call your mother first.

24:37.768 --> 24:40.806
Don't let her find out about another
family tragedy in the news.

24:53.117 --> 24:54.107
Ted!

24:58.872 --> 25:00.283
You'll report it, right?

25:01.875 --> 25:03.286
I'll handle it.

25:13.929 --> 25:16.421
Come on.
We gotta get this boat back.

25:18.267 --> 25:19.633
Watch your step.

25:19.727 --> 25:21.059
Don't move so fast.

26:05.147 --> 26:06.137
Teddy!

26:25.834 --> 26:27.120
Ted!

26:53.570 --> 26:54.560
Ted!

27:07.584 --> 27:09.701
Help. Help.

27:10.212 --> 27:12.795
<i>Our Father, who art in heaven,</i>

27:12.881 --> 27:15.043
<i>hallowed be Your name...</i>

27:15.134 --> 27:17.672
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

27:17.761 --> 27:19.593
<i>Blessed art thou amongst women,</i>

27:19.680 --> 27:21.546
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.723
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

27:23.809 --> 27:25.596
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

27:25.894 --> 27:27.851
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Your name.

27:27.938 --> 27:29.770
<i>Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,</i>

27:29.857 --> 27:31.223
<i>on Earth as it is in heaven.</i>

27:31.483 --> 27:34.647
<i>Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses,</i>

27:34.987 --> 27:37.445
<i>as we forgive those
who trespass against us.</i>

27:37.823 --> 27:39.655
<i>Lead us not into temptation,</i>

27:39.908 --> 27:42.275
<i>but deliver us from evil. Amen.</i>

27:44.121 --> 27:46.738
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.</i>

27:47.166 --> 27:48.953
<i>Blessed art thou amongst women,</i>

27:49.042 --> 27:51.955
<i>and blessed is the fruit

27:53.422 --> 27:55.789
<i>Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,</i>

27:55.883 --> 27:58.500
<i>now and at the hour of our death. Amen.</i>

28:08.896 --> 28:10.387
<i>Operator. How may I help you?</i>

28:11.356 --> 28:13.018
I need to make a collect call.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.274
<i>- Your name?</i>
- Ted.

28:18.447 --> 28:19.528
<i>Hello?</i>

28:19.615 --> 28:22.153
<i>I have a collect ball from Ted.
Will you accept the charges?</i>

28:22.659 --> 28:24.651
- <i>Yes, I will.</i>
- <i>Go ahead, please.</i>

28:24.745 --> 28:26.702
I need to speak with my father.

28:26.788 --> 28:28.450
- <i>Ted?</i>
- Now, Ann.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.669
<i>Okay, Ted, I have Joe for you.</i>

28:36.715 --> 28:41.245
Dad, I'm sorry to be calling so late, I...

28:43.138 --> 28:47.257
I've gotten myself into
the deepest kind of trouble.

28:49.228 --> 28:52.437
There was an accident and, well...

28:58.528 --> 29:00.645
One of Bobby's secretaries is dead.

29:01.657 --> 29:02.818
<i>Ah.</i>

29:02.908 --> 29:04.240
And I was driving.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.530
<i>Ah...</i>

29:06.620 --> 29:07.952
No one else was involved.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.663
And I'm okay.

29:12.876 --> 29:16.085
I may have had too much to drink.
I just don't know. I don't know.

29:19.299 --> 29:22.963
I need your help, Dad. Need it.

29:30.143 --> 29:31.554
Dad?

29:34.731 --> 29:36.142
Dad?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.475
<i>Al...</i>

29:40.821 --> 29:43.313
<i>Alibi.</i>

30:08.390 --> 30:10.757
- Good evening, sir.
- Do you have the time?

30:12.060 --> 30:15.053
- It's 2:25.
- Okay.

30:15.522 --> 30:19.061
Been having a little trouble sleeping.

30:19.693 --> 30:20.979
You have a good night.

30:22.029 --> 30:23.736
Good night, Senator.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.018
Dad!

31:45.070 --> 31:47.653
Go! Go to that house.
Tell them to call the cops.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.403
Hey, Chief.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.862
So that's the car there, huh?

32:38.582 --> 32:39.914
Mmm-hmm.

32:41.793 --> 32:44.581
Guess I'm gonna have to
find a bathing suit.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.253
- Good morning, Senator.
- Good morning.

32:46.339 --> 32:47.580
Morning.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.261
<i>This is Ted Sorensen.</i>

32:57.350 --> 33:00.309
<i>It's Teddy. Listen,
I'm gonna need someone with your</i>

33:00.395 --> 33:02.762
<i>legal and public relation skills.</i>

33:02.856 --> 33:04.267
<i>Are you alone?</i>

33:04.357 --> 33:07.316
I got the boys this weekend,
but I can talk.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.936
Listen, you're the first person
I'm telling this to.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.863
I'm not even sure
the authorities know yet.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.375
Huck, keep all those people back!

33:25.462 --> 33:29.331
Hey, come on back.
Sylvia, Walter, come on. Step on back.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.529
Paul. Paul!

34:01.289 --> 34:02.780
- Hey, Huck.
- Hey, John.

34:03.792 --> 34:05.954
Yeah, it's a '67 black Oldsmobile.

34:07.295 --> 34:09.536
- Hey.
- Hey, John.

34:09.630 --> 34:11.088
It was too dark. I couldn't see anything.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.757
Don't you worry. If anyone's down there,
I'll have 'em up in 10 minutes.

34:14.219 --> 34:16.335
Chief! That's the car
I was telling you about.

34:16.429 --> 34:17.965
The one I saw last night.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.594
Will you just pipe down
and ID whose car this is?

34:21.685 --> 34:23.301
It's coming over the radio now.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.181
<i>...registered to Edward M. Kennedy.</i>

34:25.272 --> 34:27.639
It's registered to Edward M. Kennedy.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.815
- <i>Well, who was driving?</i>
- I'd say she was.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.688
Then I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

34:31.777 --> 34:33.440
And that story plays?

34:33.530 --> 34:35.021
<i>That's what happened, isn't it?</i>

34:35.447 --> 34:36.780
Teddy boy!

34:37.534 --> 34:39.571
About to sit down to brunch.
Come on and join us.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.036
- Come on!
- I gotta let you go.

34:57.094 --> 35:00.133
Chief, we got a body.

35:11.443 --> 35:12.979
He didn't report it.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.810
That son of a bitch.

35:38.803 --> 35:41.090
There was some damage done,

35:41.181 --> 35:43.639
but I did offer to pay for it.
They kicked me out anyway.

35:43.725 --> 35:46.968
I spent all night last night
just walking around.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.559
Hey. There's Joey.

35:53.818 --> 35:54.649
Ted.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.153
I'd like to speak with you in your room.

35:58.865 --> 35:59.696
Right now.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.070
Don't be rude, Joey.
We just sat down with the Richards.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.152
It's a matter of some importance.

36:11.127 --> 36:12.618
What the fuck is going on, Ted?

36:12.712 --> 36:14.078
Wait a minute, Joey.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.255
You were supposed to
report the accident.

36:16.341 --> 36:18.003
What the hell happened last night?

36:20.595 --> 36:22.632
- I didn't report it.
- Oh, my...

36:22.722 --> 36:23.712
Shit!

36:26.810 --> 36:28.767
What could you possibly be thinking?

36:28.853 --> 36:30.640
How could you let this much time go by?

36:30.730 --> 36:33.017
Well, did you see the police arrive
at the cottage last night?

36:33.983 --> 36:34.973
No.

36:35.402 --> 36:36.563
- No.
- No?

36:36.653 --> 36:38.269
Well, don't you think,
if I had reported it,

36:38.363 --> 36:40.275
the police would have been there
within the hour?

36:40.657 --> 36:41.647
I guess so.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.778
I thought this matter had been handled.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.234
I thought I could count on you.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.613
The moment the police didn't arrive
at the cottage, you should have known.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.573
You should have known
it was your responsibility

36:50.667 --> 36:52.533
to report it to the authorities.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.993
What the hell are you talking about?

36:54.087 --> 36:55.544
No, you bungled this, Joey.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.622
You bungled it.
Now I gotta deal with it myself.

36:58.466 --> 37:00.458
We're all three implicated in this now.

37:01.010 --> 37:03.502
You can't just go
and pull this John Wayne shit!

37:05.724 --> 37:07.056
They're treating this like a crime scene.

37:07.142 --> 37:08.678
There's a dead girl out there,
for Christ's sakes.

37:08.768 --> 37:11.602
Attorney-client privilege
doesn't extend to aiding and abetting.

37:11.688 --> 37:12.974
I'm not gonna sugarcoat this.

37:13.356 --> 37:15.769
This situation's a lot worse than it was.

37:15.859 --> 37:19.102
You put us in a very
difficult position, Senator.

37:19.779 --> 37:22.567
Look, none of us has to
lose our jobs over this.

37:23.116 --> 37:27.030
You're gonna protect Paul and me,
and yourself. Okay?

37:29.372 --> 37:32.206
You just have to do
what you know is right.

37:34.544 --> 37:37.582
Okay. I'll report it.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.500
Okay.

37:41.468 --> 37:43.505
I'm going to have to say
Mary Jo was driving.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.303
- Christ.
- Joey, I love you, okay? You know that.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.005
But we both know what's at stake here.

37:48.767 --> 37:51.931
Now, we need to find a phone I can use
without someone breathing down my neck.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.511
There's one right here.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.097
You really want the desk clerk
listening in on this, Paul?

38:05.784 --> 38:06.774
Hey, Eugene.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.951
All right, let's wrap this up.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.199
I got a patient going
into labor any time now.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.952
You just tell me what's proper.
You're the medical examiner, so...

38:14.042 --> 38:16.034
- Associate medical examiner.
- What?

38:16.127 --> 38:18.414
Dr. Nevins is the resident
medical examiner.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.041
Mills here is just the associate.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.248
Yeah, well, Dr. Nevins is off today,

38:22.342 --> 38:24.675
so can we get this examination underway?

38:24.761 --> 38:26.218
Is that okay with you, Eugene?

38:26.304 --> 38:27.920
Yeah, sure.

38:30.558 --> 38:31.969
No signs of a struggle.

38:33.436 --> 38:35.393
No blood or obvious contusions.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.106
Let me check out what's in the lungs.

38:47.909 --> 38:50.617
So you said you found her
completely submerged, right?

38:50.703 --> 38:51.910
Yeah, that's right.

38:51.996 --> 38:54.955
Well, I think it's an open
and shut case. Drowning.

38:55.291 --> 38:56.953
She's been submerged for hours.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.414
A teaspoon of water
in her mouth means nothing.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.087
The foam around all the air passages,

39:02.173 --> 39:03.880
that suggests suffocation to me.

39:03.967 --> 39:07.756
I didn't realize that you undertakers
had a medical degree now.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.803
I don't, but I've seen enough dead bodies.

39:10.515 --> 39:13.724
Are you saying that there's a possibility
that maybe she didn't drown?

39:13.810 --> 39:16.302
Hey, when I was down there,
she was holding herself up

39:16.396 --> 39:18.228
like she was trying to get
her last breath of air.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.932
I could have had her out
of that car in 25 minutes

39:21.025 --> 39:23.017
if I got the call, but no one called.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.148
<i>Senator Kennedy's office.</i>

39:29.242 --> 39:30.198
<i>David.</i>

39:30.285 --> 39:32.948
<i>We have a situation here on
Chappaquiddick.</i>

39:33.037 --> 39:34.528
<i>What kind of situation?</i>

39:34.622 --> 39:37.410
There's a firestorm headed your way
and you need to be ready for it.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.459
<i>Okay, but I'll be more ready
when I know what it's about.</i>

39:40.545 --> 39:43.879
Listen, the situation is,

39:44.465 --> 39:47.048
my car was involved in an accident.

39:47.427 --> 39:50.295
I am going to be saying that
I wasn't the one driving.

39:51.306 --> 39:53.719
<i>Well, were you driving?</i>

39:56.311 --> 39:59.134
<i>Senator. Were you driving?</i>

40:01.316 --> 40:02.397
<i>Senator?</i>

40:05.486 --> 40:06.977
<i>Senator, are you okay?</i>

40:07.405 --> 40:09.943
<i>Was anyone hurt?
Have the police been notified?</i>

40:10.867 --> 40:15.487
<i>Ted, it would help a lot
if you gave me some details.</i>

40:16.539 --> 40:18.656
<i>Ted? Ted, are you there?</i>

40:19.375 --> 40:21.458
Uh, that's all you need to know for now.

40:29.844 --> 40:31.631
Uh, I'm headed back to town.

40:31.721 --> 40:34.054
- Yeah. That's a good idea.
- Joey, take care of the girls.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.507
Make sure they don't get
wrapped up in any of this.

40:36.601 --> 40:39.344
- I was thinking the same thing.
- Paul, you, uh...

40:39.437 --> 40:42.054
Paul, you go with Ted. Run interference.

40:42.148 --> 40:43.935
Make sure he doesn't
talk with anyone else.

40:44.025 --> 40:44.856
Got it.

40:54.702 --> 40:55.909
Wake up, everybody!

40:55.995 --> 40:57.406
Wake up, get packed, get dressed.

40:57.497 --> 40:58.954
We're leaving as soon as possible.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.203
This garbage can is for
all of the responsible,

41:05.296 --> 41:07.333
non-alcoholic, upright citizens' trash.

41:10.718 --> 41:11.708
This one's for everything else.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.339
All the bottles, cans...

41:13.429 --> 41:15.261
Joey, will you just tell us
what's going on already?

41:15.348 --> 41:16.338
No bullshit.

41:18.351 --> 41:20.843
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.137
There's, um...

41:24.232 --> 41:26.724
- There's been an accident.
- What?

41:26.818 --> 41:30.357
Senator Kennedy's car went off the bridge
at Poucha Pond last night.

41:31.030 --> 41:35.616
He's okay, but we cannot find Mary Jo.

41:35.702 --> 41:37.284
Are the police looking for her?

41:45.795 --> 41:49.254
I want you to know that every effort
possible was made to save her.

41:50.383 --> 41:52.750
Oh, my God, she's dead.

41:59.267 --> 42:02.681
Okay. What do we need to do now?

42:04.397 --> 42:06.389
What do we do to help the senator?

42:10.319 --> 42:13.278
<i>You all need to
get off the island as soon as possible.</i>

42:14.574 --> 42:15.940
<i>Nobody knows you're here.</i>

42:17.035 --> 42:20.779
<i>Just get yourselves home and keep quiet.</i>

42:22.665 --> 42:24.327
<i>Remember what Ted said last night.</i>

42:26.085 --> 42:27.201
<i>We're family.</i>

42:28.963 --> 42:31.296
We need to protect each other like family.

42:38.056 --> 42:41.140
Senator, I hear you were in
an accident this morning.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.761
I can't make any statements.

42:42.852 --> 42:44.138
There're a lot of questions being asked.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.060
Jim, I'd appreciate
some understanding on this.

42:46.522 --> 42:47.888
If the rumors are true,

42:48.316 --> 42:50.182
I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

42:53.738 --> 42:56.025
The senator won't be
making any statements.

43:03.998 --> 43:05.580
- Senator.
- Is the chief in?

43:05.666 --> 43:08.955
The chief's not here.
That's his private office.

43:09.420 --> 43:13.380
We're just gonna wait in there
until the chief gets back, okay?

43:18.179 --> 43:20.091
Come on, folks.
Let's step it back a little bit.

43:21.140 --> 43:23.928
Can somebody tell me why
we haven't found Senator Kennedy yet?

43:24.310 --> 43:26.518
<i>He's right here at the station, Chief.</i>

43:28.981 --> 43:31.064
Well, can you tell him to
get his ass down here?

43:32.401 --> 43:34.609
<i>The senator wants you to come to him.</i>

43:39.659 --> 43:42.868
Sorry, he's not here.
No, I don't have...

43:42.954 --> 43:44.286
Chief's on his way.

43:44.956 --> 43:47.414
Good, thanks, Paul. That'll be fine.

43:50.002 --> 43:51.538
Will you please give me a moment?

43:53.840 --> 43:54.830
Sure.

44:03.432 --> 44:05.594
<i>Directory assistance.
What listing, please?</i>

44:06.352 --> 44:09.390
Uh, Kopechne, Berkeley Heights,
New Jersey, I think.

44:09.480 --> 44:10.891
I'm unsure of the spelling.

44:13.609 --> 44:14.816
<i>I'll connect you.</i>

44:19.448 --> 44:20.529
<i>Hello?</i>

44:20.616 --> 44:24.280
- Hello, Mrs. Kopechne?
<i>- Yes, it is.</i>

44:24.745 --> 44:28.489
This is Senator Ted Kennedy,
Mrs. Kopechne.

44:28.583 --> 44:29.994
Could I please speak to your husband?

44:30.376 --> 44:32.413
<i>Oh, Senator.</i>

44:33.212 --> 44:35.670
<i>Joseph's not here at the moment.</i>

44:36.340 --> 44:38.332
<i>Can I take a message for him?</i>

44:41.804 --> 44:44.592
Mrs. Kopechne,
Mary Jo was involved in an accident.

44:46.767 --> 44:48.599
<i>Was it in a car?</i>

44:48.686 --> 44:50.598
It was an automobile accident.

44:52.940 --> 44:57.025
She was... She was returning to take
a ferry back to the mainland

44:57.111 --> 44:58.602
when the accident occurred.

45:04.118 --> 45:05.905
<i>Was my daughter killed?</i>

45:10.041 --> 45:11.031
Yes.

45:15.171 --> 45:18.505
Mary Jo was an exceptional human being.

45:20.092 --> 45:25.463
She served my brother and my family

45:26.307 --> 45:30.301
with grace, dignity...

46:30.705 --> 46:33.038
<i>Ted, you're on with Joe.</i>

46:33.124 --> 46:35.958
<i>Dad, I'm at the police station.</i>

46:37.003 --> 46:39.791
I'm telling you this because
I wanted to let you know

46:39.880 --> 46:42.543
that I am going to explain
to them what happened.

46:43.634 --> 46:46.001
And I'm going to say that
I was the one driving.

46:47.513 --> 46:51.553
I will protect myself,
but I have to do what's right.

46:52.643 --> 46:54.225
I have to tell the truth.

46:55.062 --> 46:56.598
<i>Alibi.</i>

47:05.448 --> 47:08.361
I'm not going to be the one
defined by my flaws.

47:09.368 --> 47:13.237
Joe Jr. Was the favorite one.
Jack was the charming one.

47:13.331 --> 47:14.538
Bobby was the brilliant one.

47:14.623 --> 47:15.989
And what did that leave me, Dad?

47:16.083 --> 47:18.200
The fat one? The stupid one?

47:18.294 --> 47:20.251
I'll tell you what.
The one who got in the most trouble.

47:21.380 --> 47:23.963
Well, I can be charming.
I can be brilliant. I can...

47:25.343 --> 47:27.380
I am the only son you got left.

47:28.971 --> 47:31.429
I'm the one making this decision, Dad.
I'm the one...

47:31.515 --> 47:34.428
<i>Ted, he's writing something.</i>

47:37.646 --> 47:40.935
<i>He says, "You're the head
of the family now. Start acting like it."</i>

47:41.025 --> 47:42.015
Goodbye, Dad.

48:03.923 --> 48:04.834
<i>This is Dun Gifford.</i>

48:04.924 --> 48:07.917
Dun, I need you on
the next plane to Edgartown.

48:08.010 --> 48:10.218
<i>Yeah, I've been expecting
your call. David filled me in.</i>

48:10.304 --> 48:11.135
Good.

48:11.722 --> 48:14.260
Listen, we've made mistakes here.
I want you to understand that.

48:15.017 --> 48:16.804
But I want to make sure, going forward,

48:16.894 --> 48:18.635
we handle everything
with the utmost integrity.

48:18.938 --> 48:20.019
<i>I understand.</i>

48:21.107 --> 48:24.521
We need to make sure the poor girl's body
gets to her family right away.

48:24.610 --> 48:26.192
Can you... Can you do that for me?

48:26.278 --> 48:30.272
<i>Uh, okay, but there may be a delay
if they want to perform an autopsy.</i>

48:30.366 --> 48:32.358
Why do you think I want it out of here?

48:33.411 --> 48:35.027
Can you handle this or not?

48:35.121 --> 48:37.454
<i>Of course, Senator,
but what if they demand...</i>

48:39.166 --> 48:40.156
Paul.

48:47.967 --> 48:49.128
Paul, I, uh...

48:50.136 --> 48:52.469
I need you to help me come up
with a written statement.

48:52.847 --> 48:54.509
I'm going to say I was driving.

48:55.599 --> 48:58.216
I don't want to drag you and Joey into
this any more than I already have.

48:58.310 --> 48:59.801
So we're just gonna leave that part out.

48:59.895 --> 49:03.104
I mean any part that can hurt my position
with the police or the public,

49:03.816 --> 49:07.025
we're gonna leave out. Can you do that?

49:10.656 --> 49:11.646
Sure.

49:12.283 --> 49:13.649
Is there any truth to the rumor?

49:13.742 --> 49:16.200
Has the senator been found?

49:23.043 --> 49:24.284
Hold all my calls.

49:24.378 --> 49:26.961
Bob, there's a bunch of reporters outside.
Keep them out there, all right?

49:27.047 --> 49:28.083
- Yes, sir.
- Outside.

49:30.551 --> 49:32.008
Good morning, Chief.

49:34.513 --> 49:35.503
Senator.

49:36.307 --> 49:39.141
I have a statement I'd like to read,
if that's okay.

49:40.478 --> 49:41.889
Okay.

49:52.323 --> 49:54.940
"On July 18, 1969,

49:55.701 --> 49:57.784
at approximately 11:15 p.m.

49:58.329 --> 50:00.946
in Chappaquiddick, Martha's Vineyard,
Massachusetts,

50:02.333 --> 50:04.416
<i>I was driving my car on Main Street</i>

50:04.502 --> 50:06.539
<i>on the way to get the ferry
back to Edgartown.</i>

50:08.339 --> 50:11.047
<i>I was unfamiliar with the road
and turned right onto Dike Road</i>

50:11.133 --> 50:13.750
<i>instead of bearing a hard left
onto Main Street.</i>

50:14.970 --> 50:18.008
After proceeding for
approximately one half mile...

50:18.974 --> 50:22.388
I discovered a hill
and came upon a narrow bridge...

50:23.479 --> 50:25.436
then went off the edge of the bridge.

50:27.608 --> 50:30.146
There was one passenger
in the car with me,

50:31.237 --> 50:32.694
Miss Mary Jo Kopechne.

50:33.989 --> 50:37.153
She was a former secretary of my brother
Robert F. Kennedy.

50:38.911 --> 50:42.450
<i>The car turned over and landed
on the roof, resting on the bottom.</i>

50:43.749 --> 50:46.537
I attempted to open the door
and the window of the car,

50:47.419 --> 50:49.706
and have no recollection of
how I got out."

50:52.716 --> 50:56.630
<i>"I came to the surface
and then repeatedly dove down</i>

50:56.720 --> 50:59.303
<i>to see if the passenger
was still in the car."</i>

51:13.779 --> 51:15.065
Mary Jo!

51:16.740 --> 51:19.073
Come on. Come on. Mary Jo!

51:20.244 --> 51:22.361
<i>"I was unsuccessful in the attempt."</i>

51:25.165 --> 51:27.657
<i>"I was exhausted and in a state of shock.</i>

51:30.045 --> 51:32.628
<i>I recall walking back to
where my friends were eating.</i>

51:34.133 --> 51:36.250
<i>I then asked someone to
bring me back to Edgartown.</i>

51:37.636 --> 51:39.923
<i>I remember walking around
for a period of time</i>

51:40.014 --> 51:41.755
<i>and then going to my hotel room.</i>

51:43.017 --> 51:45.600
When I fully realized
what had happened this morning,

51:46.312 --> 51:48.520
I immediately contacted the police."

51:55.863 --> 51:57.525
Well, I'm glad you're okay, Senator.

52:02.661 --> 52:04.948
Normally, I would need to
hold you for questioning.

52:05.039 --> 52:06.200
Type this up, please.

52:06.290 --> 52:07.371
Are you sure that's necessary?

52:07.458 --> 52:08.539
Whatever you think is right.

52:08.626 --> 52:10.288
But your written statement here
pretty much answers

52:10.377 --> 52:11.788
- any questions I might have.
- I agree.

52:11.879 --> 52:13.336
I trust your experience, Chief.

52:13.672 --> 52:16.255
Why don't we see if we can get you
back to Hyannis Port right away?

52:16.592 --> 52:18.800
I got a friend who's a pilot,
he can get you there in no time.

52:18.886 --> 52:20.468
The senator would really appreciate that.

52:31.398 --> 52:33.105
Sounds fine. Fine, Chief.

52:33.692 --> 52:36.309
Now, Chief,
if you wouldn't mind not letting

52:36.403 --> 52:37.860
the press get a hold of that statement,

52:37.946 --> 52:39.812
you know, just till I get the all clear
from my lawyer.

52:39.907 --> 52:41.899
Not a problem, Senator.
Just, uh...

52:41.992 --> 52:44.405
You just let me know
if there's anything else I can do for you.

52:44.495 --> 52:48.114
No, sir. You're doing
a bang-up job here, Dominic.

52:48.207 --> 52:49.493
A bang-up job.

52:52.086 --> 52:54.920
Is there a, uh...
You got another way out of here?

52:56.507 --> 52:58.715
- <i>Where's Ted now?</i>
- <i>Flying home as we speak.</i>

52:59.176 --> 53:00.838
<i>What concerns me is
his written statement.</i>

53:00.928 --> 53:02.590
<i>Has anyone even reached this police chief?</i>

53:02.680 --> 53:04.717
<i>Absolutely no comment.
Not a damn word from anybody.</i>

53:04.807 --> 53:06.218
<i>No sweat. Count on us.</i>

53:06.308 --> 53:08.470
<i>Said he'd hold off
releasing Ted's statement...</i>

53:09.937 --> 53:11.223
<i>Leaving the scene is bad enough,</i>

53:11.313 --> 53:13.020
<i>but what the hell was he doing
for eight hours?</i>

53:13.107 --> 53:14.769
<i>Do we know for sure
there were no witnesses?</i>

53:14.858 --> 53:16.690
<i>If we're lucky,
it'll be leaving the scene.</i>

53:17.736 --> 53:19.318
- <i>Get a copy.</i>
- <i>Manslaughter.</i>

53:19.405 --> 53:22.489
<i>Anybody calls,
I don't care who it is, no comment.</i>

53:23.492 --> 53:24.858
<i>Absolutely no comment.</i>

53:59.653 --> 54:01.269
Oh, Ted.

54:02.072 --> 54:04.053
Your father wasn't expecting you so soon.

54:05.200 --> 54:08.034
How's he, uh... How's he holding up, Ann?

54:08.996 --> 54:11.204
Oh... Uncle Joe was rather emotional.

54:12.499 --> 54:14.582
But physically, he's doing better.

54:16.170 --> 54:17.251
Good.

54:22.718 --> 54:23.834
Wait here, Ted.

54:28.724 --> 54:30.306
He'd prefer to come to you.

54:42.112 --> 54:43.944
Teddy's arrived, Joe.

55:18.565 --> 55:19.646
I'm glad to see you, Dad.

55:21.944 --> 55:23.060
You look good.

55:30.035 --> 55:32.698
I want to tell you again
how sincerely sorry I am...

55:34.623 --> 55:36.910
that I ever let a thing like this happen.

55:38.585 --> 55:40.827
And reassure you that
I have the situation,

55:40.921 --> 55:43.459
as terrible as it is,
under my complete control.

55:46.260 --> 55:47.796
I know...

55:50.264 --> 55:54.008
I'm sorry I got us into this.

55:57.020 --> 55:58.852
But if you can trust me, Dad,

55:59.106 --> 56:01.314
I have faith I can get us out.

56:03.026 --> 56:04.767
Your father would like to tell you...

56:08.115 --> 56:09.651
"You've lost my confidence.

56:10.576 --> 56:12.738
Do as I say and never lose it again.

56:13.495 --> 56:16.078
Otherwise, it will be
a nearly impossible task

56:16.164 --> 56:17.530
to restore it."

56:23.797 --> 56:25.663
Your dad really does love you.

56:27.509 --> 56:30.172
He hasn't been this active
since before Bobby died.

56:45.777 --> 56:47.018
Ted.

57:02.628 --> 57:06.212
Well, Bob, you handled
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

57:06.924 --> 57:08.756
Now let's see what you can do
with this one.

57:10.594 --> 57:12.426
- Hello, Mr. Kennedy.
- Joe.

57:13.388 --> 57:14.845
Hi, Teddy.

57:18.018 --> 57:21.102
Dad. I see you're still the man
with all the influence.

57:24.608 --> 57:28.773
Gentlemen, I appreciate

57:29.279 --> 57:31.612
you all making this short trip
on my behalf.

57:33.116 --> 57:35.654
But I hope you'll understand
I'm going to handle this with my own team,

57:36.328 --> 57:38.615
since it's my political future
here at stake.

57:38.705 --> 57:41.288
You won't have a political future
if you're in jail, Ted.

57:42.084 --> 57:44.246
You're fighting a battle
on two fronts and you don't even know it.

57:44.336 --> 57:46.168
I think you need to cool down here, Bob.

57:46.672 --> 57:48.584
Okay? I understand my problem
with the press

57:48.674 --> 57:50.256
and with the people of Massachusetts.

57:50.342 --> 57:51.924
That's just the half of it.

57:52.010 --> 57:53.842
You're also in serious legal trouble, son.

57:55.097 --> 57:56.133
Teddy.

57:57.641 --> 58:02.056
Teddy, if they find that your negligence
contributed to this girl's death,

58:02.145 --> 58:03.932
that's involuntary manslaughter.

58:04.022 --> 58:07.390
If there's even a whisper that you're
not as clean as Mother Teresa,

58:07.651 --> 58:08.983
you will be charged.

58:09.653 --> 58:11.986
And there's not a lot of senators
that are charged with manslaughter

58:12.072 --> 58:14.689
- that go on to become president.
- Oh, I understand, Bob.

58:14.783 --> 58:16.991
That is to say
nothing about being convicted.

58:17.077 --> 58:18.613
If you are even indicted,

58:18.704 --> 58:20.240
it won't matter what verdict comes back.

58:20.872 --> 58:22.784
The court of public opinion
will have your head on a stake.

58:23.458 --> 58:25.825
We'll give it to Sorensen.
We won't have that problem.

58:25.919 --> 58:28.457
"Problems," Ted. Problems, plural.

58:29.339 --> 58:30.375
They are threefold.

58:31.299 --> 58:35.543
One, the information we know that we need
to make sure no one else knows.

58:35.637 --> 58:39.381
Two, the information we don't know
that we need to make sure stays unknown.

58:39.474 --> 58:41.887
Three, the information that
you have already admitted to

58:41.977 --> 58:43.684
that we need to make people forget.

58:44.604 --> 58:45.765
Now, to the first point.

58:46.356 --> 58:48.097
A dead body holds a lot of secrets.

58:48.191 --> 58:50.729
Those secrets can be the difference
between guilt and innocence,

58:50.819 --> 58:52.185
so we need to be in control of them.

58:52.487 --> 58:55.651
The only way to do that is
to be in control of that dead girl's body.

58:55.741 --> 58:58.950
Good. Because my staffer, Dun Gifford,

58:59.327 --> 59:01.159
is already at the funeral home right now.

59:01.621 --> 59:05.080
And that poor girl's body isn't going
anywhere except home to New Jersey

59:05.167 --> 59:06.248
without us knowing about it.

59:06.334 --> 59:07.916
Senator, with all due respect,

59:08.003 --> 59:11.087
having a gofer sitting on his hands
in the lobby isn't getting us anywhere.

59:12.632 --> 59:15.750
Now, there are explicit procedures

59:16.344 --> 59:19.212
that must be followed
for moving a body across state lines.

59:20.015 --> 59:21.472
Do you have any idea,

59:21.558 --> 59:23.800
has the death certificate
even been signed yet?

59:32.360 --> 59:33.646
Dun Gifford.

59:33.737 --> 59:35.478
Dun, listen, we're in this
deeper than I thought.

59:35.572 --> 59:38.406
I need you to get the death certificate
signed as soon as possible.

59:38.867 --> 59:42.201
- Do whatever it takes.
<i>- Yeah. I'll look into that.</i>

59:42.996 --> 59:43.986
Ted?

59:45.165 --> 59:47.578
Good as done. Just waiting on word back.

59:47.667 --> 59:50.000
Good. Now, as I was saying,

59:50.087 --> 59:51.999
we need to parse through
the unknowns of this case

59:52.089 --> 59:54.502
to determine if there's any liabilities
hiding in the trees.

59:55.425 --> 59:59.510
So what evidence can be used against Ted
to prove he acted negligently, hmm?

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.838
Why are we just assuming that
I acted negligently, Bob?

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:03.844
There's a dead body in
the Edgartown mortuary

01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.721
that would suggest it's a possibility.

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:08.394
There's no witnesses. There's no evidence.

01:00:09.272 --> 01:00:10.854
I mean, what proof can there possibly be?

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:12.939
Were your headlights working, Ted?

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.312
Oh, of course they were working.

01:00:14.402 --> 01:00:15.984
Was your license
in good standing?

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:18.358
- Anyone see you drinking?
- Were you wearing your safety belts?

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.110
Did you tires leave skid marks?

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:23.192
I think my license might be expired.

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:25.570
Your license is expired?

01:00:25.664 --> 01:00:27.371
What, do you really think
that's a problem?

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:28.868
- Teddy!
- How is that negligent?

01:00:28.959 --> 01:00:31.997
Anytime you get behind the wheel,
you are in breach of the law.

01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:33.498
I'd say that's pretty negligent.

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:35.671
That means that he
was driving against the law.

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:36.873
This thing is worse than I thought.

01:00:39.719 --> 01:00:42.553
Joe Greelish runs
the Hyannis motor registry.

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:47.425
We can get him to run the license
through his connections in Edgartown.

01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:48.726
Let Gifford talk to him.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.724
Damn it, Ted, you can't
be connected to this!

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.180
It's all right.
I know just the guy.

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:53.390
James Smith.

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:56.692
He worked as an advance man
for Jack on the '60 campaign.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:58.356
Off the books.

01:00:59.364 --> 01:01:02.482
<i>Just so happens he finds himself
working in the local DA's office.</i>

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:04.984
<i>How's that gonna help us?</i>

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:08.446
<i>He'll know people in government
sympathetic to the cause.</i>

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:10.281
<i>You know.
Look into it, maybe?</i>

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:12.742
Of course, James.
I'll make some calls.

01:01:12.836 --> 01:01:14.327
<i>That's excellent, Walter.</i>

01:01:14.421 --> 01:01:16.458
Ted and I go
way back to Suffolk County.

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:18.835
<i>I'm sure the senator
would appreciate it.</i>

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:20.670
I'll see what I can do.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.876
<i>Thanks, Walter.</i>

01:01:28.685 --> 01:01:30.096
We got it.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:37.767
Whoa! As soon as I have more information,

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.693
I'll get it to you. Thank you.

01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:45.441
<i>...200 feet per second.</i>

01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:47.822
<i>The astronauts fully expected
they would need to perform</i>

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:50.371
<i>another course correction
to make certain they entered</i>

01:01:50.457 --> 01:01:52.289
<i>the correct orbit around the moon...</i>

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:54.704
What's the cutoff for the national papers?

01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:57.502
On Saturday, 5:00 p.m. Why?

01:01:57.589 --> 01:02:00.047
A story like this could dominate
the headlines for weeks.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:03.134
It'll take nothing short
of men walking on the moon

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.552
to knock it off the front page.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:09.307
Fortunately for us, it looks like
Ted's big brother arranged for just that.

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.468
Now, if we can keep a tight lid on this

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.018
for a couple more hours,

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:16.229
we might actually be able to
develop a decent PR strategy.

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:18.103
By the time the papers have room for Ted,

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:20.059
they'll all be writing
exactly what we want them to.

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:23.021
After a thorough examination,
Ted's doctor here

01:02:23.114 --> 01:02:26.653
deduced he suffered a concussion
and was in a state of shock.

01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:29.118
But I haven't even
examined the patient yet.

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:30.661
That won't be necessary.

01:02:30.747 --> 01:02:33.956
There's nothing left to do
but run out the clock, gentlemen.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:35.578
Come 5:00 p.m.,

01:02:35.669 --> 01:02:37.581
we'll be back out in front of the problem.

01:02:39.965 --> 01:02:42.207
Actually, <i>New York Times</i>
already has a story.

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:44.337
- What?
- Excuse me?

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:48.297
On my way to the station,
I bumped into a reporter.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:50.802
Seemed to know that
I was involved in an accident.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:52.884
Who was it, Ted?
What was his name?

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:55.685
James Reston.

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.764
- Reston.
- James Reston?

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:00.144
The chief political correspondent
and executive editor.

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:03.399
How? How could you forget to mention that?

01:03:03.488 --> 01:03:04.820
I was in a state of shock.

01:03:04.906 --> 01:03:07.023
- Bullshit, Ted!
- Hey, hey.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.700
Now we gotta get someone
to the Kopechnes as soon as possible.

01:03:09.786 --> 01:03:11.778
Someone's gotta run
interference with any press

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:14.784
before one of her parents
says something that totally sinks us.

01:03:14.874 --> 01:03:17.116
They're in New Jersey, so someone
ought to get over there quick.

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:22.208
What are you still doing here?

01:03:24.092 --> 01:03:26.550
Markham, you get that chief on the line
and you make sure he understands

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:29.970
he is not to release that written
statement under any circumstances.

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:31.467
<i>Times</i> may have this right now,

01:03:31.558 --> 01:03:33.299
but let's see if
we can keep it an exclusive.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.350
Ted, get your press secretary, uh...

01:03:36.062 --> 01:03:37.303
- Dick, um...
- Drayne.

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:39.639
Get Dick Drayne to feed
a leak to the <i>Times.</i>

01:03:39.733 --> 01:03:41.224
Let him know that, uh...

01:03:42.485 --> 01:03:44.522
you've been diagnosed with
a very serious concussion.

01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:47.104
That would explain
why you're acting like a mental patient.

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:50.741
Anything else, gentlemen?

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.409
Be sympathetic.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:04:00.375
"When I, Ted, fully realized
what had happened..."

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:02.044
Chief Arena, telephone.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.543
Hang on.
Hang on, guys. I gotta take this.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:08.797
Hello.

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:12.301
Chief, thank God I got you.
Uh, I need to ask a big favor.

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:15.133
Uh, can you hold off on the senator's
statement just a little longer?

01:04:15.226 --> 01:04:17.343
<i>- Couple hours.</i>
- You're gonna have to speak up, son.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:18.973
I've got a room full of reporters here.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:21.101
I need you to hold off

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:23.934
on releasing the senator's statement

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:25.313
a little longer.

01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:27.269
Well, I'm sorry, I've already released it.

01:04:27.364 --> 01:04:28.275
What?

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:30.322
<i>I'm just going through it
for the third time.</i>

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:32.240
Oh, Jesus.

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:34.910
Actually, I have a few questions
for you, Mr. Markham.

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:38.368
Now, remember, Dick, this is an exclusive.

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:39.915
You don't need to overdo it.

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:42.163
We're just trying to make sure
this doesn't spin out of control

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:43.789
into something like manslaughter...

01:04:44.923 --> 01:04:46.789
or an affair, God forbid.

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.962
<i>You don't need to say another word.</i>

01:04:49.636 --> 01:04:51.798
And throw it something about
me being on sedatives.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:53.254
Make it sound dramatic.

01:05:00.563 --> 01:05:02.680
This is James Reston
of the <i>New York Times.</i>

01:05:02.774 --> 01:05:05.687
<i>- James, Dick Drayne here.</i>
- Hello, Dick.

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:07.734
<i>It's a terrible thing
about this accident.</i>

01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:09.232
Yes. Yes, it is.

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:11.697
<i>The senator suffered a serious concussion.</i>

01:05:11.783 --> 01:05:15.823
<i>His physician has him on sedatives
just so he can manage the pain.</i>

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:21.703
Sedatives? With a concussion?

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:27.671
Your friend the police chief
just sank this entire ship.

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:29.293
What do you mean? How?

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:31.417
Mr. Markham?

01:05:31.511 --> 01:05:33.673
He read the written statement
to the press.

01:05:34.681 --> 01:05:36.092
Three times, apparently.

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:38.174
The story's gonna hit the wire any minute.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:40.305
Okay, look, we're not sunk yet.

01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:43.138
- That statement's pretty airtight.
- Oh, airtight, huh?

01:05:43.231 --> 01:05:45.644
You contradict yourself
in the first two sentences.

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:48.350
Main road's paved, Teddy. Dike Road's not.

01:05:48.445 --> 01:05:50.607
Doesn't take an expert cartographer
to tell the difference.

01:05:50.697 --> 01:05:53.405
And what about this deputy that
saw your car driving away from the ferry

01:05:53.491 --> 01:05:54.902
at a quarter to 1:00 in the morning?

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:56.825
Yeah, well, that's just
his word against mine.

01:05:56.911 --> 01:05:58.868
We gotta go through
his statement line by line.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:02.198
Guys, guys, I think we're
overreacting here. All right?

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:03.749
Dick's running the concussion story.

01:06:03.835 --> 01:06:05.667
That's going to explain
any inconsistencies.

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.955
Dick Drayne on line three.

01:06:10.049 --> 01:06:11.665
This should be interesting.

01:06:13.303 --> 01:06:15.090
Dick, you're on with the boys.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:17.297
So, did the sedative stuff play?

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:20.800
<i>Did any of you guys
actually consult a physician?</i>

01:06:20.894 --> 01:06:22.260
Yeah, of course.

01:06:22.353 --> 01:06:24.515
<i>Well, according to Reston,
you don't give sedatives</i>

01:06:24.606 --> 01:06:27.144
<i>to a patient who's had a concussion.</i>

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:28.440
<i>It could kill them.</i>

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:31.109
- Sedatives?
- Good Lord.

01:06:31.196 --> 01:06:33.813
Bay of Pigs was a better run operation.

01:06:35.617 --> 01:06:37.984
<i>We need to seriously
rebalance this equation.</i>

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:40.907
Edna, hang up.
Don't talk to anybody, all right?

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:45.248
Walter? What are you doing here?

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:47.163
I'm the special prosecutor.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:48.619
They assigned me to the Kennedy case.

01:06:48.713 --> 01:06:50.796
Thank God.

01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:53.920
We can use all the help we can get.

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:58.338
<i>Mary Jo Kopechne,</i>

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:00.798
<i>a passenger in the senator's automobile,</i>

01:07:00.892 --> 01:07:02.474
<i>was drowned early Saturday morning</i>

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:05.724
<i>when he drove the car off a bridge
and overturned in a pond.</i>

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:08.522
<i>Police say that Kennedy
reported the accident</i>

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:10.224
<i>about nine hours later.</i>

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:12.731
<i>The last ferry left at midnight.</i>

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.732
<i>The crewmen say Kennedy was not on it.</i>

01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:16.355
<i>The questions arise,</i>

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:18.031
<i>who took him across the channel?</i>

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:20.617
<i>And didn't one of his friends
ask him where he'd been?</i>

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:22.236
<i>How he got wet?</i>

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:24.492
<i>Where his car and Miss Kopechne were?</i>

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.867
<i>If the questions were raised,
what were the answers?</i>

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:31.870
Seems like
they want you back inside.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.128
I'm busy. Can't you tell?

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:41.592
I can't watch you do this, Ted.

01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:45.184
- Do what, Joe?
- Self-destruct.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:49.642
Nobody's said anything.

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:52.437
Perhaps they haven't seen it, but I have.

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:56.737
You've been on this path since Bobby died.

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:02.034
Your expectations for your
whole life didn't change

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.702
the moment he hit the ground.

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.365
There never were any expectations
for my life.

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:09.575
Yes, there were, Joey. There always were.

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:14.205
I needed you. I needed you to protect me.

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:18.171
You're the only brother I have left, Joe.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:24.048
This has to be the end of my involvement.

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:27.969
I'm sorry, Teddy.
I wish ol' Joey could fix it,

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:30.062
but I can't.

01:08:33.276 --> 01:08:35.859
<i>"We choose to go to
the moon not because it is easy,</i>

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.652
<i>but because it is hard."</i>

01:08:38.906 --> 01:08:41.523
<i>What does your brother's promise
to America mean to you?</i>

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:46.738
<i>He was always someone
who kept his promises.</i>

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:51.785
<i>My brother committed his life
to the idea that</i>

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:55.042
<i>the United States is
a beacon of democracy.</i>

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:56.997
<i>And so too for my family,</i>

01:08:57.425 --> 01:09:00.042
<i>I think he was a beacon.
Someone we all hoped to...</i>

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:01.468
That looks good.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:02.886
Hard to believe this was yesterday.

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:05.259
<i>He said this mission
would have, quote,</i>

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:08.593
<i>"a great impact on the minds
of the men across America."</i>

01:09:08.685 --> 01:09:11.429
<i>I think my brother set a course
for the entire nation</i>

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.180
<i>in a way that we can never abandon.</i>

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:18.106
Anyone watching now would think
it's business as usual with the Kennedy's.

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.651
<i>Even in my own life,
I've often asked,</i>

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:23.657
<i>what would Jack have me do?</i>

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:25.568
<i>Space is there.</i>

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.032
<i>And the moon and the planets are there.</i>

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.823
<i>And new hopes for knowledge
and peace are there.</i>

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:35.745
<i>And therefore as we set sail,
we ask God's blessing</i>

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:38.421
<i>on the most hazardous and dangerous</i>

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:41.966
<i>and greatest adventure
on which man has ever embarked.</i>

01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:44.886
Uncle Jack could do anything, huh, Dad?

01:09:46.808 --> 01:09:49.926
<i>President Kennedy bast
a long shadow and still does.</i>

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:52.432
<i>It's one I walk in every day.</i>

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:54.228
<i>Thank you, Senator.</i>

01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:57.399
<i>Now we hear
from Houston that the crew has, uh,</i>

01:09:57.485 --> 01:09:59.727
<i>completed putting on the spacesuits,</i>

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:01.483
<i>and the boots, helmets,</i>

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:05.316
<i>and are now donning their
portable life support system.</i>

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:09.324
<i>That backpack that carries
their oxygen, the cooling liquids,</i>

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:11.371
<i>and their communications equipment.</i>

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:14.666
<i>And they're set for a four-hour
stay on the lunar surface.</i>

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:16.585
<i>Well within that margin,</i>

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:18.458
<i>they will get back in the spacecraft</i>

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:22.041
<i>after 2 hours and 40 minutes
on the lunar surface.</i>

01:10:22.135 --> 01:10:24.627
<i>We've had no further estimate
in the last few minutes</i>

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:28.340
<i>as to the actual time
when they will step out of the spacecraft.</i>

01:10:28.433 --> 01:10:32.473
<i>Of course, we're standing by
for further word from Houston on that.</i>

01:10:50.705 --> 01:10:52.321
Don't worry. I'll get it.

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:58.581
Oh, hello.
Are Gwen and Joe here?

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:00.458
We've heard about their loss
and we're so sorry.

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:03.086
The Kopechnes thank you for your kindness.

01:11:03.176 --> 01:11:06.135
Would we be able to see them
just for a moment, please?

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:09.171
<i>Okay, Neil, we ban
see you coming down the ladder now.</i>

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.552
<i>There he is.
There's a foot coming down the step.</i>

01:11:11.642 --> 01:11:13.759
<i>I'm at the foot of the ladder.</i>

01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:16.603
<i>The LM footpads are only, uh...</i>

01:11:18.232 --> 01:11:22.772
<i>depressed in the surface
about one or two inches.</i>

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:25.653
<i>Although the surface appears to be,</i>

01:11:25.948 --> 01:11:30.739
<i>uh, very, very fine-grained
as you get close to it.</i>

01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:32.535
<i>It's almost like a powder.</i>

01:11:33.498 --> 01:11:36.206
<i>Down there, it's very fine.</i>

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:40.377
<i>I'm going to step off the LM now.</i>

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:44.752
<i>Armstrong is on the moon.</i>

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:53.390
<i>On this July 20th, 1969.</i>

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:56.344
<i>That's one small step for man...</i>

01:11:57.396 --> 01:12:00.230
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.440
<i>I think that was Neil's quote.</i>

01:12:02.527 --> 01:12:03.563
<i>I didn't understand.</i>

01:12:03.653 --> 01:12:05.315
<i>One small step for man,</i>

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:06.645
<i>but I didn't get the second phrase.</i>

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:10.069
<i>Some more of our monitors here...</i>

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:19.040
<i>It was only this
morning, by evolution's clock,</i>

01:12:19.126 --> 01:12:21.869
<i>that he fashioned the glass
that brought distance close,</i>

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:25.001
<i>showed him that his world,
the epicenter of everything,</i>

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:28.505
<i>is only a small speck in the
second-rate solar system...</i>

01:12:36.727 --> 01:12:39.470
Teddy, what the hell are you doing?

01:12:40.064 --> 01:12:41.805
What does it look like?

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:44.516
Well, whatever you're doing,
it looks ridiculous.

01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:47.523
I'm winning back the sympathies
of my constituents.

01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:49.859
Yeah? It looks fake.

01:12:49.949 --> 01:12:51.941
It's as real as can be.
It's a real neck brace.

01:12:52.034 --> 01:12:54.151
Well, it looks fake on you.

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:55.869
That's 'cause you know me.

01:12:56.581 --> 01:12:57.822
Come on, Teddy. Take that thing off.

01:12:58.082 --> 01:12:59.664
No. Joey, no. I'm gonna wear it. No.

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:01.286
Ted, come on. It's stupid.

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:02.910
Joey, no, I like it.

01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:05.121
Don't, Joey! No, no, no!

01:13:08.134 --> 01:13:08.965
Joey!

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.093
That's it!
Take it... Take it off!

01:13:12.179 --> 01:13:14.045
My back! My back, Joey!
Get off of me.

01:13:15.141 --> 01:13:17.929
Aw, my back.

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:21.520
You're not a victim, Ted!

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:25.307
Jesus.

01:13:26.986 --> 01:13:29.319
I'm gonna ask Dad and see what he says.

01:13:36.996 --> 01:13:38.407
- Come in.
- Dad.

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:40.746
- Hey, Teddy.
- Oh, hey, guys.

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:43.666
Listen. Fellas, what do you think about me
wearing this to the funeral?

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:45.210
I think it might gain us some sympathy.

01:13:45.296 --> 01:13:46.912
You look like a putz, Ted.

01:13:47.006 --> 01:13:48.668
You know how weak
that'll look to the Russians?

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:49.874
The hell with you guys!

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:53.210
I'll wear what I want.

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:06.557
Thanks for doing this, Joany.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:10.185
Go fuck yourself, Teddy.

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:18.614
I, uh, I lost my family
when I was very young.

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.115
Both parents.

01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:25.166
I can only imagine
how much harder this is.

01:14:26.545 --> 01:14:28.753
I just wanted you to know,

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:32.128
I needed to tell you both that...

01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:36.087
I did everything I could for Mary Jo.

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:41.512
I tried to save her, Mr. Kopechne.

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:44.728
I did everything I could.

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:49.687
What did you say your name was, again?

01:14:54.615 --> 01:14:56.322
Senator,
thank you so much for being here.

01:14:56.409 --> 01:14:57.399
Mr. Kopechne.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:59.325
I know
what a sacrifice you must have made.

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:00.948
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:15:01.038 --> 01:15:02.574
Thank you
for trying to save our daughter.

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:04.122
If there's anything
I can do, please.

01:15:23.894 --> 01:15:25.806
...sayeth to the angel,

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:28.897
"Here am I, the servant of the Lord.

01:15:28.983 --> 01:15:31.646
Let it be with me according to your word."

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:35.316
And so it was with our Mary Jo,

01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:38.114
that from faith she drew her strength,

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.362
her conviction and purpose in this world.

01:15:40.453 --> 01:15:43.070
It was faith that led Mary Jo...

01:16:01.223 --> 01:16:03.636
<i>Please tell me
I can believe in you.</i>

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:21.445
What are you so afraid of?

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:23.743
<i>Senator?</i>

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:26.913
Senator.

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:32.957
You were up there for a very long time.

01:16:36.634 --> 01:16:38.546
I got lost in my thoughts.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:40.927
How's your wife?

01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:44.047
She's okay.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:47.384
I really am curious.

01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:50.763
Tragedy has a way of defining people.

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:54.149
On one hand, you have someone
like Jackie who goes

01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:56.818
and practically becomes
ambassador for the family.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.112
Keeping the legacy alive.

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.402
On the other hand,

01:17:01.492 --> 01:17:04.075
a tragedy like this
cripples some people...

01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:08.242
till they curl up into a ball.

01:17:11.418 --> 01:17:13.080
Joany's more the latter.

01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:16.417
I think there's a third kind of person.

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:21.467
The kind of person
who defines their own legacy.

01:17:23.013 --> 01:17:26.506
I think my chance to define my legacy
died with Mary Jo.

01:17:27.268 --> 01:17:30.227
Senator, look at Mr. And Mrs. Kopechne.

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:34.097
They don't blame you.

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:37.980
Why should America?

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:45.488
Senator, an officer's saying
he saw you at 12:45

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:47.911
with a woman after the ferry closed.

01:17:47.997 --> 01:17:50.785
What about the rumors that
Ms. Kopechne was pregnant?

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:52.537
"Kennedy walked around with an open collar

01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:54.663
showing off a previously
unseen neck brace."

01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:56.620
<i>What affect do you think</i>

01:17:56.714 --> 01:17:58.626
this will have on your
political career, Senator?

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:01.379
And when can we expect some answers
to some of these questions?

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:02.959
"For a man wearing a neck brace,

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:06.842
Kennedy had no trouble craning around
to see who was behind him at the funeral."

01:18:06.932 --> 01:18:07.843
<i>Senator!</i>

01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:09.799
I'll make a statement
at the appropriate time.

01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:12.602
And when exactly will
that appropriate time be, Senator?

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:14.270
Can you give us an indication

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:15.722
of when that appropriate
time will be, Senator?

01:18:20.070 --> 01:18:21.402
Those are the Boston papers.

01:18:21.822 --> 01:18:22.858
You want to hear from the <i>New York Times</i> ?

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:25.235
No, I got it.

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.117
The neck brace was a mistake.
I see that now.

01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:31.237
Damn it.

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:36.076
This country has a deep connection
to the Kennedy name,

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:38.036
and that is a valuable thing, gentlemen.

01:18:38.714 --> 01:18:40.455
And we can't just let that go to waste.

01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:45.301
We need to remind the American people
what this family has been through.

01:18:46.222 --> 01:18:47.679
And how much more we have left to achieve.

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:50.007
And how are you planning
on doing that, Ted?

01:18:52.686 --> 01:18:54.473
A nationally televised statement.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:59.395
All three networks, prime time.

01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:01.477
Is that all?

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:05.943
Why not have Ted fill in for
Carson on <i>The Tonight Show</i> ?

01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:08.487
That's actually not a bad idea.

01:19:09.203 --> 01:19:11.786
The networks will donate the time
if it's part of their news coverage.

01:19:12.206 --> 01:19:15.040
We could frame the national conversation
the way we want it framed.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:17.412
- How do we do that?
- He's got to look sympathetic.

01:19:17.503 --> 01:19:19.790
It'd be easier to get him
to fill in for Carson.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.246
We tell the truth.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:23.460
Or at least our version of it.

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:27.339
And it ends with an appeal to the voters,

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:29.216
to the people that elected me.

01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:32.470
We need to remind them
that this family perseveres,

01:19:32.559 --> 01:19:34.346
that we don't back down from a fight,

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:36.177
that we don't get backed into a corner.

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:38.639
We have a true compass and we follow it.

01:19:39.984 --> 01:19:41.941
Now I followed mine
the best I could that night.

01:19:42.027 --> 01:19:44.189
And me and Paul and Joe,

01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.738
we did everything we could
to save that poor girl.

01:19:46.824 --> 01:19:48.690
- You got a winner there, son.
- Amen to that, Bob.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:50.571
Son of a bitch,
that's a hell of a winner.

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:52.660
We get Sorensen to dress this speech up,

01:19:52.746 --> 01:19:54.408
you might make it through
this thing unscathed.

01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:56.865
If we do this right,
you might be more electable.

01:19:56.959 --> 01:19:58.291
That's good.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:01.127
A girl dies,

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:05.006
and yet somehow Ted is the martyr?

01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:08.584
Think about it.

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:13.470
Do we really want to prop him up
as an injured hero here?

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:15.551
This strategy's the only thing
we've come up with

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:18.227
that has a chance of saving Ted.
We need to all get behind it.

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:23.105
I'm telling you, these theatrics
are not gonna hold up in a court of law!

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:25.022
He's right.

01:20:26.030 --> 01:20:28.773
We need to make sure this case is closed
before Ted talks to the press.

01:20:28.866 --> 01:20:30.402
The hearing's not till Monday.

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:33.155
Then we move it up immediately
or we will not survive the weekend.

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:34.326
I'll give Steele a call.

01:20:34.413 --> 01:20:36.075
First, get a solid plea deal in place.

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:37.997
I want his word on that,
and I want it in person.

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:41.159
Markham. Markham!

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.286
- Me?
- Yes, you.

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:48.208
Joe, I meant it before.
I need you with me on this.

01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:51.340
I meant what I said before too, Ted.

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:52.511
I can't go any further.

01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.427
I'm packing my bags.
I'll be gone tomorrow.

01:20:56.727 --> 01:21:00.311
Joe, this is your family too.
Start acting like it.

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:06.601
<i>This is Steele.</i>

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:08.277
<i>I'd like to speak
with the district attorney.</i>

01:21:08.364 --> 01:21:10.777
- <i>One moment.</i>
- <i>This is Dinis.</i>

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:13.358
<i>I'm still down here
in Edgartown with Chief Arena.</i>

01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:15.193
<i>I just got a call about the hearing...</i>

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:17.199
<i>Yeah, yeah,
I got the same call, Walter.</i>

01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:20.953
- <i>How do you want to proceed?</i>
- <i>Look, as far as I understand it,</i>

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:22.909
<i>we don't really have
the evidence to build a case.</i>

01:21:23.003 --> 01:21:25.620
<i>There's no autopsy report,
the girl's already been embalmed.</i>

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.296
<i>He's got an impeccable driving record.</i>

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:29.716
<i>And for God sakes,
the guy had a concussion.</i>

01:21:30.094 --> 01:21:31.926
<i>You're very wise, sir.</i>

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:34.386
<i>I want you to pass along
a message for me.</i>

01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:35.589
<i>What's that?</i>

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:38.550
<i>From me through you
to Ted and no one else.</i>

01:21:38.644 --> 01:21:41.637
<i>I won't touch this case
unless Ted wants me to.</i>

01:21:43.357 --> 01:21:44.347
Paul.

01:21:45.776 --> 01:21:47.142
Walter.

01:21:48.946 --> 01:21:52.314
It's done. Hearing's been
moved to Friday morning.

01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:54.820
Good. The senator will be there.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:58.237
He's prepared to plead guilty
to leaving the scene.

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.913
The Commonwealth
will recommend a minimum of

01:22:01.208 --> 01:22:03.200
two months incarceration.

01:22:05.170 --> 01:22:08.413
<i>Upon the 200th year
of this nation's life,</i>

01:22:08.507 --> 01:22:11.625
<i>it would be wonderful if we could do
the same thing with domestic issues</i>

01:22:11.718 --> 01:22:14.176
<i>that President Kennedy did
with the space program.</i>

01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:19.595
<i>Arena says he also has witnesses</i>

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.802
<i>who can account for
the senator's movements</i>

01:22:21.895 --> 01:22:25.013
<i>during the eight hours between
the death of Mary Jo Kopechne</i>

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:27.520
<i>and when the senator
reported it to the police.</i>

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.441
<i>Now, Senator Kennedy</i>

01:22:29.528 --> 01:22:32.612
<i>is back in the Kennedy compound
in seclusion.</i>

01:22:32.698 --> 01:22:36.692
<i>And when or if he will answer questions
about the death of Mary Jo Kopechne</i>

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:38.401
<i>is still unknown.</i>

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.073
<i>I'll fix it right now.</i>

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:44.291
<i>Ice-cold lemonade.</i>

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:45.708
<i>Where's Dad?</i>

01:22:46.044 --> 01:22:48.206
<i>Five cents a glass.</i>

01:22:49.173 --> 01:22:52.086
<i>Five bents says he's
having another cup of coffee.</i>

01:22:59.766 --> 01:23:01.758
Your father wanted to speak with you.

01:23:08.609 --> 01:23:10.350
What is it, Dad?

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:20.611
Ann, I need you to leave us, please.

01:23:21.622 --> 01:23:23.705
It's very rare these days
I'm alone with my father

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:25.156
and the things I need to say to him,

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.207
I need to say to him in private.

01:23:29.296 --> 01:23:30.912
Of course, Teddy.

01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:48.930
Dad, did you know I never
wanted to be president?

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:51.683
Does it even matter to you?

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:55.978
I wanted to make you proud.

01:23:57.282 --> 01:23:58.944
That's all I've ever wanted.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.492
I spent my whole life...

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:06.073
chasing your dreams for you, just like...

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:10.493
Joe and just like Jack

01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:13.337
and just like Bobby, and look

01:24:13.966 --> 01:24:15.548
what happened to them.

01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:20.381
They were great men...

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:24.382
but they weren't great
because of who you were.

01:24:25.352 --> 01:24:27.810
They were great because of who they were.

01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:31.355
Dad...

01:24:32.442 --> 01:24:35.731
I want to be a great man.

01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:39.230
I just don't know who I am.

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:48.823
You...

01:24:51.503 --> 01:24:54.871
will never...

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:58.670
be great.

01:25:10.647 --> 01:25:12.104
Come here.

01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:50.810
Joey, no. I need you...

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:53.183
If it's about the statement,
I want nothing to do with it.

01:25:53.273 --> 01:25:54.889
Just the opposite.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:56.690
I need you to write me a resignation.

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:01.938
I'll take care of it.

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:06.735
Thank you. For the last time.

01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:12.407
I'm proud of you.

01:26:13.251 --> 01:26:15.538
Well, don't tell anyone else
how proud you are.

01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:17.871
And let's just keep this
between the two of us.

01:26:26.932 --> 01:26:28.264
<i>Senator Edward Kennedy,</i>

01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:31.305
<i>the only one of
the four brothers left alive,</i>

01:26:31.395 --> 01:26:35.355
<i>went into court today and pleaded guilty
to leaving the scene</i>

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:37.397
<i>of an accident where
a young woman drowned.</i>

01:26:37.734 --> 01:26:40.192
<i>He got a sentence of two months in jail,</i>

01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:43.021
<i>the sentence suspended,
and a year's probation.</i>

01:26:43.115 --> 01:26:46.984
<i>The judge gave him the minimum jail
sentence and suspended that,</i>

01:26:47.119 --> 01:26:51.238
<i>because, he said, Kennedy already had been
and would be punished</i>

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:54.119
<i>more than anything
the court could do to him.</i>

01:26:55.085 --> 01:26:56.747
I have made my plea.

01:26:56.837 --> 01:26:59.250
I have requested time
on the networks tonight

01:27:00.006 --> 01:27:02.373
to speak to the people of
Massachusetts and the nation.

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:04.967
Your questions will all be answered then.

01:27:05.679 --> 01:27:08.888
<i>The suspended sentence
took many among the crowd</i>

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:10.636
<i>waiting outside the courthouse
by surprise.</i>

01:27:21.778 --> 01:27:23.019
Mr. Steele,

01:27:23.113 --> 01:27:25.856
is it true that you and Senator Kennedy
were friends and co-workers

01:27:25.949 --> 01:27:27.156
when you were in Suffolk County?

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:28.528
Please just answer the question.

01:27:28.618 --> 01:27:29.950
Are you friends with Ted Kennedy?

01:27:30.036 --> 01:27:32.198
Mr. Steele, please just
answer the question.

01:27:32.789 --> 01:27:35.497
<i>Senator Kennedy's
suspended sentence was granted</i>

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:39.419
<i>on the basis of his character
and his worldwide reputation.</i>

01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:43.168
<i>But it's this worldwide reputation
that is now the larger question.</i>

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:46.543
<i>What can or will he do
to preserve his potential</i>

01:27:46.636 --> 01:27:49.003
<i>as a candidate for
President of the United States?</i>

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.009
<i>Kennedy will
make a statement on television</i>

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:53.762
<i>tonight at 7:30 Eastern Time.</i>

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:56.265
<i>It will, of course, be seen live.</i>

01:27:56.354 --> 01:27:58.186
<i>It will be a statement only.</i>

01:27:58.273 --> 01:28:01.016
<i>No reporters will be allowed in,
by his decision,</i>

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:03.066
<i>and so no questions will be asked.</i>

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:07.693
<i>We've heard speculation on the possibility
he might resign from the Senate.</i>

01:28:07.949 --> 01:28:11.408
<i>But it is only speculation,
and we don't know what he will say.</i>

01:28:11.703 --> 01:28:12.910
Sorensen been through this?

01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:14.988
This whole thing is Sorensen's baby.

01:28:15.081 --> 01:28:16.492
I think we've got a real winner here.

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:17.790
If you say so.

01:28:18.919 --> 01:28:20.535
Okay, so for
the first half of the speech,

01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:23.246
we felt it would seem more stately
for you to be reading.

01:28:23.799 --> 01:28:25.006
Then halfway through,

01:28:25.091 --> 01:28:27.504
we have you make a direct appeal
to the voters.

01:28:27.594 --> 01:28:30.337
And we think, in order to get them
to really want to write in,

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:33.969
mail letters and show their support
for you and the family,

01:28:34.059 --> 01:28:36.221
you should look straight into camera,

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:37.722
set the papers down,

01:28:37.813 --> 01:28:40.271
and just talk from the heart.

01:28:42.943 --> 01:28:44.855
David, I'm not off-script on this.

01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:46.686
No, no, we'll have cue cards.

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:48.066
They're being done right now.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:49.313
Okay.

01:28:50.742 --> 01:28:53.735
- Sorensen's here.
- Hey, Teddy.

01:28:55.372 --> 01:28:59.457
So, what do you think?

01:28:59.543 --> 01:29:01.785
- What do I think?
- Well, yeah, you wrote it.

01:29:02.128 --> 01:29:04.336
You know, what's your feeling on it?

01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:06.873
I don't know, Teddy.

01:29:07.425 --> 01:29:10.259
History usually has the final word
on these things.

01:29:13.431 --> 01:29:14.763
Good luck.

01:30:07.068 --> 01:30:09.310
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Bring them in.

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:10.861
Who's doing cue cards?

01:30:10.947 --> 01:30:12.233
Where are the cue cards?

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:16.946
Oh, hey, Joey.

01:30:17.037 --> 01:30:19.745
Ted, I got it. It's right here.

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:23.912
Thanks. I appreciate it.

01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.127
Senator.

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:31.003
Want to look it over?

01:30:32.052 --> 01:30:33.463
Okay, yeah.

01:30:39.142 --> 01:30:40.678
I've been thinking.

01:30:42.312 --> 01:30:46.773
Joey, we both have flaws, do we not?

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:48.224
Okay, live in two minutes.

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.943
Yeah, of course we do. We all do.

01:30:51.529 --> 01:30:54.863
Right. Right. I thought that myself.

01:30:54.950 --> 01:30:57.363
What's right is here
in front of you.

01:30:57.744 --> 01:30:59.781
I don't know what's right anymore.

01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:02.200
Joey, let's wrap things up.

01:31:04.125 --> 01:31:08.085
Ted, I didn't say this before,
but I agree with you

01:31:08.171 --> 01:31:10.663
that Kennedy's do have a true compass.

01:31:10.757 --> 01:31:12.544
And it's because you're following yours

01:31:12.634 --> 01:31:14.091
that we're here right now.

01:31:14.594 --> 01:31:17.883
You told the police that you were driving.
You told the truth.

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:20.636
You had me write this resignation.

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:22.808
Sorensen's speech...

01:31:22.894 --> 01:31:25.136
Sorensen's speech is bullshit.

01:31:25.563 --> 01:31:27.555
Every word of it. He made it up.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:30.141
All the thoughts and emotions.

01:31:30.944 --> 01:31:32.105
I was there.

01:31:32.612 --> 01:31:35.696
I've been there with you
from the very beginning.

01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:39.658
This may give me a chance
at a new beginning.

01:31:39.744 --> 01:31:42.657
This isn't about opportunity.
It's about integrity.

01:31:44.249 --> 01:31:46.491
- One minute.
- One minute, Joey!

01:31:49.379 --> 01:31:51.166
Joey, you have flaws.

01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:55.382
We all do. You said so yourself.

01:31:56.469 --> 01:31:57.801
Moses had a temper.

01:31:58.763 --> 01:32:00.629
Peter betrayed Jesus.

01:32:01.683 --> 01:32:02.844
I have Chappaquiddick.

01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:06.470
Yeah, Moses had a temper,

01:32:06.563 --> 01:32:09.271
but he never left a girl
at the bottom of the Red Sea.

01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:12.733
I still need someone
to hold these cue cards.

01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:16.737
Ol' Joey will fix it.

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:20.153
Be a great cue card holder,
wouldn't you, Joey?

01:32:20.869 --> 01:32:22.280
Thirty seconds!

01:32:22.829 --> 01:32:25.492
That's great.
Now, right over this way.

01:32:25.582 --> 01:32:27.574
Right down here, in front of the camera.

01:32:28.126 --> 01:32:30.368
Right there. Hey, thanks, pal.

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:34.288
Okay, people, we're live

01:32:34.924 --> 01:32:37.382
in ten, nine,

01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:41.721
eight, seven, six,

01:32:42.015 --> 01:32:44.678
five, four,

01:32:45.101 --> 01:32:46.262
three...

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:52.856
My fellow citizens...

01:32:54.027 --> 01:32:57.486
I have requested this opportunity
to talk to the people of Massachusetts

01:32:57.906 --> 01:33:00.774
about the tragedy which happened
last Friday evening.

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:03.909
This morning I entered a plea of guilty

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:06.328
to the charge of leaving
the scene of an accident.

01:33:07.207 --> 01:33:08.664
Prior to my appearance in court,

01:33:08.750 --> 01:33:12.744
it would have been improper
for me to comment on these matters.

01:33:13.379 --> 01:33:15.712
But tonight I am free to tell you

01:33:15.799 --> 01:33:19.543
what happened and to say
what it means to me.

01:33:20.804 --> 01:33:22.591
On the weekend of July 18th...

01:33:23.473 --> 01:33:25.886
I was on Martha's Vineyard Island
participating

01:33:26.184 --> 01:33:28.642
with my cousin, Joseph Gargan,

01:33:29.312 --> 01:33:32.146
as for 30 years my family has participated

01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:35.775
in the annual Edgartown sailing regatta.

01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:40.397
Only reasons of health
prevented my wife from accompanying me.

01:33:43.368 --> 01:33:46.657
On Chappaquiddick Island
off Martha's Vineyard,

01:33:47.288 --> 01:33:51.123
I attended on Friday evening,
July 18th, a cookout

01:33:51.668 --> 01:33:53.534
I had encouraged and helped sponsor

01:33:54.003 --> 01:33:57.121
for a devoted group of
Kennedy campaign secretaries.

01:33:57.966 --> 01:34:01.255
<i>When I left the party around 11:15 p.m.,</i>

01:34:01.928 --> 01:34:03.965
<i>I was accompanied by one of these girls,</i>

01:34:04.722 --> 01:34:06.429
<i>Miss Mary Jo Kopechne.</i>

01:34:07.809 --> 01:34:10.267
<i>Mary Jo was one of the most
devoted members of the staff</i>

01:34:10.353 --> 01:34:12.265
<i>of Senator Robert Kennedy.</i>

01:34:12.564 --> 01:34:15.978
<i>She worked for him for four years
and was broken up over his death.</i>

01:34:16.943 --> 01:34:21.563
<i>For this reason and because she was
such a gentle, kind and idealistic person,</i>

01:34:22.407 --> 01:34:25.115
<i>all of us tried to help her feel
that she still had a home</i>

01:34:25.201 --> 01:34:26.487
<i>with the Kennedy family.</i>

01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:30.613
<i>There is no truth, no truth whatever,</i>

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:34.534
<i>to the widely circulated
suspicions of immoral conduct</i>

01:34:34.627 --> 01:34:38.997
<i>that have been leveled at my behavior
and hers regarding that evening.</i>

01:34:39.883 --> 01:34:41.795
<i>I know nothing in Mary Jo's conduct</i>

01:34:42.302 --> 01:34:44.043
<i>on that or any other occasion,</i>

01:34:44.387 --> 01:34:46.970
<i>and the same is true for
the other girls at that party,</i>

01:34:47.849 --> 01:34:50.762
<i>that would lend any substance
to such ugly speculation</i>

01:34:50.852 --> 01:34:52.559
<i>about their character.</i>

01:34:53.646 --> 01:34:55.933
<i>Nor was I driving under
the influence of liquor.</i>

01:34:57.567 --> 01:34:58.899
We should get back.

01:34:58.985 --> 01:35:00.772
<i>Little over a mile away,</i>

01:35:01.112 --> 01:35:03.024
the car that I was driving
on an unlit road

01:35:03.615 --> 01:35:06.073
<i>went off a narrow bridge
which had no guardrails</i>

01:35:06.659 --> 01:35:09.493
and was built on a left angle to the road.

01:35:09.954 --> 01:35:11.991
<i>The car overturned in a deep pond</i>

01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:13.788
and immediately filled with water.

01:35:15.210 --> 01:35:18.294
I remember thinking, as the cold water
rushed in around my head,

01:35:18.379 --> 01:35:21.122
that I was for certain drowning.

01:35:21.466 --> 01:35:24.083
<i>But somehow I struggled to surface alive.</i>

01:35:24.177 --> 01:35:26.885
<i>Made immediate and repeated
efforts to save Mary Jo...</i>

01:35:26.971 --> 01:35:29.714
<i>...succeeded only in increasing
my state of utter exhaustion.</i>

01:35:29.807 --> 01:35:33.141
<i>My conduct during the next several hours</i>

01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:35.140
<i>makes no sense to me at all.</i>

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:39.682
<i>My doctors informed me that I suffered
a cerebral concussion as well as shock.</i>

01:35:40.109 --> 01:35:42.647
<i>I walked back to the cottage
where the party was being held</i>

01:35:42.737 --> 01:35:44.478
<i>and requested the help of two friends,</i>

01:35:44.739 --> 01:35:46.901
<i>my cousin Joseph Gargan and Paul Markham.</i>

01:35:46.991 --> 01:35:50.280
Their strenuous efforts
also proved futile.

01:35:50.370 --> 01:35:52.202
<i>I had them take me to the ferry crossing.</i>

01:35:52.288 --> 01:35:53.620
<i>This was some time after midnight.</i>

01:35:53.706 --> 01:35:55.163
<i>The ferry having shut down for the night,</i>

01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:56.707
<i>I suddenly jumped into the water</i>

01:35:56.793 --> 01:35:59.080
<i>and impulsively swam across,</i>

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:02.288
nearly drowning once again in the effort.

01:36:03.132 --> 01:36:04.964
I regard as indefensible

01:36:05.343 --> 01:36:09.633
<i>the fact that I did not report
the accident to the police immediately.</i>

01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:15.309
<i>All kinds of scrambled thoughts
which I cannot recall,</i>

01:36:15.395 --> 01:36:17.682
<i>some of them confused,
some of them irrational,</i>

01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:19.559
<i>went through my mind.</i>

01:36:19.899 --> 01:36:22.892
<i>I was overcome by a jumble of emotions.</i>

01:36:22.986 --> 01:36:25.899
<i>Grief, fear, doubt,</i>

01:36:26.572 --> 01:36:29.656
<i>exhaustion, panic, confusion.</i>

01:36:29.742 --> 01:36:32.280
<i>I remember thinking, whether somehow</i>

01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:37.786
<i>some awful curse did
actually hang over all the Kennedy's.</i>

01:36:44.048 --> 01:36:46.335
These events, the publicity,

01:36:46.426 --> 01:36:49.214
innuendo and whispers
which have surrounded them,

01:36:49.846 --> 01:36:51.712
and my admission of guilt this morning,

01:36:52.265 --> 01:36:54.507
raises the question in my mind

01:36:55.143 --> 01:36:57.351
of whether my standing
among the people of my state

01:36:57.437 --> 01:37:01.272
has been so impaired
that I should resign my seat

01:37:01.733 --> 01:37:03.474
in the United States Senate.

01:37:05.403 --> 01:37:09.397
<i>The stories of past courage
cannot supply courage itself.</i>

01:37:10.074 --> 01:37:13.943
<i>For this, each man must look
into his own soul.</i>

01:37:14.954 --> 01:37:19.449
And so I ask you tonight,
the people of Massachusetts,

01:37:20.084 --> 01:37:21.620
to think this through with me.

01:37:22.545 --> 01:37:25.754
In facing this decision,
I seek your advice and opinion.

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:29.087
In making it, I seek your prayers.

01:37:30.219 --> 01:37:33.803
For this is a decision that I will finally
have to make on my own.

01:37:37.477 --> 01:37:41.016
I pray that I can have the courage
to make the right decision.

01:37:43.274 --> 01:37:44.515
Whatever is decided,

01:37:45.318 --> 01:37:47.480
whatever the future holds for me,

01:37:48.446 --> 01:37:54.989
I hope that I shall be able
to put this most recent tragedy behind me.

01:37:59.707 --> 01:38:02.324
Thank you and good night.

01:38:14.097 --> 01:38:16.510
What do you think about
Senator Kennedy's accident

01:38:16.599 --> 01:38:18.261
and his statement last night?
Did you see it on television?

01:38:18.351 --> 01:38:19.967
- Yes, I did see it.
- What did you think?

01:38:20.061 --> 01:38:22.804
Well, I was quite impressed by it.

01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:25.389
I think it's a tough break for the guy.
The guy's a good guy.

01:38:25.483 --> 01:38:27.770
He tried to help the girl
and he's all mixed up.

01:38:27.860 --> 01:38:29.647
He's always had tough breaks.
The family and everything.

01:38:29.737 --> 01:38:30.568
I'm in favor of him.

01:38:30.655 --> 01:38:34.023
Well, I feel if it was anybody else,
they would have hung him.

01:38:34.117 --> 01:38:36.279
I think he should quit.
Quit his job right now.

01:38:36.369 --> 01:38:39.237
Hell, if a guy's drinking,
those things can happen all the time.

01:38:39.330 --> 01:38:40.821
What makes you think
he was drinking?

01:38:41.290 --> 01:38:42.906
Well, you don't go to a party
and no drinking.

01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.164
I mean, there's more to it than what we
know, I believe, you know?

01:38:46.671 --> 01:38:48.253
But I actually would vote for him.

01:38:48.339 --> 01:38:51.503
- Would you vote for him again?
- I certainly would. Definitely.

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:53.925
There's a lot of things missing
that I didn't understand.

01:38:54.011 --> 01:38:56.344
But, like, as the story progressed,
you know,

01:38:56.431 --> 01:38:59.390
you hear different versions
and you make your own opinions.

01:39:00.101 --> 01:39:01.558
What was your final opinion?

01:39:02.645 --> 01:39:06.434
That he really was, you know...
He didn't remember what he really did.

01:39:06.524 --> 01:39:07.810
That he's telling the truth.

01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:10.483
Would you vote for him?
Do you think he should be the president?

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:13.277
Oh, I'm not qualified to say that.
I really don't know.

01:39:13.364 --> 01:39:14.855
I think I would vote for him, though.

01:39:14.949 --> 01:39:16.190
<i>Would you vote for him again?</i>

01:39:16.284 --> 01:39:17.991
- <i>Yes, I really would.</i>
- <i>Certainly.</i>

01:39:18.077 --> 01:39:19.784
