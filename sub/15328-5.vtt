19:17.948 --> 19:18.866
- What am I go gonna do?

19:18.949 --> 19:21.326
My swag bags are ruined.

19:21.410 --> 19:21.869
My career is ruined.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.163
My hair is ruined!

19:24.246 --> 19:24.746
- Steph, calm down.

19:24.830 --> 19:25.581
We can fix this.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.749
- No, we can't!

19:27.833 --> 19:28.667
There's no coming back
from this.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.670
This is a disaster!

19:31.753 --> 19:33.046
- You know
what's really a disaster?

19:33.130 --> 19:35.090
- My makeup?

19:35.173 --> 19:36.383
- No.

19:36.466 --> 19:38.135
Yes, but no.

19:38.218 --> 19:41.722
I was talking about
an actual hurricane.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.807
We'll tell all the guests these
bags are just part of a theme.

19:43.891 --> 19:44.850
They'll be all over it.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.519
They paid $300 a plate.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.856
Rich people love to feel like
they've gone through something.

19:50.939 --> 19:51.732
- You think it'll work?

19:51.815 --> 19:53.775
- Oh, yeah.

19:53.859 --> 19:54.735
I'll start putting these
under the chairs,

19:54.818 --> 19:57.362
and making the wait staff
look windblown.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.614
You go deal with the caterers,

19:58.697 --> 20:01.617
and then throw some sticks
and leaves in your hair.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.453
- Wow.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.955
You listened.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.206
You empathized.

20:08.290 --> 20:08.665
You asked questions.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.542
You didn't yell.

20:10.626 --> 20:14.588
Gabby, you LEAD--ed.

20:14.671 --> 20:16.798
- I did.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.052
- I am so proud of you.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.930
[laughs] Oh.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.932
- Now let's go
fake us a hurricane.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.350
Oh, if you find
any stray kittens,

20:26.433 --> 20:29.019
wet 'em down
and sit 'em in a swag bag.
