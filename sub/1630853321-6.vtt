Annie, Annie.

eating after midnight!

Get out of here!

00:40.882 --> 00:42.719
Ugh!

00:45.324 --> 00:48.531
That's not
what I sound like.

00:50.535 --> 00:53.340
You guys, scat!

00:56.680 --> 00:58.651
Aww, our poor trash.

00:58.718 --> 01:01.022
It was so happy in our kitchen.

01:01.089 --> 01:03.694
This is all because someone
didn't want to pay

01:03.761 --> 01:05.732
the extra $5 for locking lids.

01:05.765 --> 01:09.238
Hey, that $5 got me
this raccoon poison

01:09.305 --> 01:12.177
that I didn't have
the heart to use.

01:12.244 --> 01:14.148
Can't we just wait
until the snow covers it?

01:14.181 --> 01:15.752
The longer you complain
about it,

01:15.818 --> 01:17.087
the longer it doesn't get done.

01:17.154 --> 01:19.258
So, if we complain
until the snow covers it...

01:19.358 --> 01:21.997
Make with the rakes.
all: Aww.

01:22.064 --> 01:23.868
Am I the only one having fun?

01:23.935 --> 01:27.241
Hee-hee, hee-hee, hee-hee.
Ha-ha!

01:27.308 --> 01:30.314
Duncan, you accidentally
threw away your report card.

01:30.380 --> 01:33.621
"Still struggling
with everything."

01:36.392 --> 01:37.829
Going somewhere, Helen?

01:37.896 --> 01:40.535
My oldest sister had a baby.

01:40.568 --> 01:41.804
A living one?

01:41.904 --> 01:43.106
She means we're just surprised,

01:43.173 --> 01:45.310
because you're so old, and we--

01:45.344 --> 01:48.316
- How old do you think I am?
- Two hundred--

01:48.350 --> 01:50.922
Congratulations
to your sister

01:50.989 --> 01:52.057
and her miracle child.

01:52.091 --> 01:53.961
You should come with me, Duncan.

01:53.995 --> 01:55.632
You might get baby fever.

01:55.665 --> 02:00.007
- Better than raking trash.
- Give your sister our best.

02:00.742 --> 02:04.215
All right, everybody, that
trash isn't gonna clean itself.

02:04.281 --> 02:07.421
- It's the city's problem now.
- Woo-hoo!

02:07.488 --> 02:10.260
- Yeah!
- Well, there goes my day.

02:12.431 --> 02:15.805
Kimberly, look,
an adult guy in jorts.

02:15.838 --> 02:17.742
I make $42 an hour.

02:17.809 --> 02:19.846
That's good money, but--

02:19.946 --> 02:24.021
Sorry about them.
Can I help--you--

02:24.088 --> 02:25.223
I have a package
for Helen Diggins,

02:25.257 --> 02:26.894
and there's nothing in it
I want.

02:26.927 --> 02:28.129
You can leave it
on her porch.

02:28.163 --> 02:29.666
No, Jack.
I just read an article

02:29.700 --> 02:33.306
about the scourge of
porch pirates in Porch Weekly.

02:33.373 --> 02:36.379
Oh, I love Porch Weekly.
The crosswords are so hard.

02:36.412 --> 02:38.784
- She's married, dude.
- Happily?

02:38.851 --> 02:40.120
Hit the road, shorts.

02:40.153 --> 02:41.990
We'll leave it
in the back of the house.

02:42.024 --> 02:43.761
Porch pirates hate that.

02:46.099 --> 02:49.238
Argh, the back of the house?

02:49.305 --> 02:53.948
The day is lost, boys. Argh.

02:54.015 --> 02:55.852
Why are we doing a favor
for Helen?

02:55.885 --> 02:57.087
She treats us like crap,

02:57.154 --> 02:58.390
and she's always
hitting on our son.

02:58.423 --> 03:00.427
Look, she's an awful neighbor
and predator,

03:00.460 --> 03:02.532
but that's no reason
to not be nice.

03:02.565 --> 03:05.638
You're right, honey.
Let's be good neighbors.

03:08.944 --> 03:10.280
Splash?

03:10.313 --> 03:12.919
Helen doesn't own anything
that goes splash.

03:12.952 --> 03:14.221
That was a splash, right?

03:14.288 --> 03:16.593
Oh, I know water,
and that was a splash.

03:24.643 --> 03:25.945

03:25.978 --> 03:28.984
So this is what you can buy
when you don't have kids?

03:29.018 --> 03:31.456
A TV outside?

03:31.523 --> 03:35.330
Well, in all my years.
- And there's a deck?

03:35.397 --> 03:38.203
As long as I can remember,
I've always wanted

03:38.236 --> 03:41.442
to be a deck guy
hosting epic backyard parties,

03:41.476 --> 03:43.948
inviting everyone
in the neighborhood to my home,

03:43.981 --> 03:45.317
but not in my home.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.289
Flipping burgers, plating
burgers, talking burgers,

03:48.323 --> 03:50.628
and then everyone raises
their burgers in my honor

03:50.661 --> 03:54.435
and yell, "To Jack,
the king of the deck!"

03:54.468 --> 03:57.040
You've wanted that as long
as you can remember?

03:57.040 --> 03:58.644
More than anything.

03:58.711 --> 04:01.984
Helen's yard is so much
cooler than ours, Mom.

04:02.050 --> 04:03.253
Can we use it while she's gone?

04:03.353 --> 04:05.858
all: Can we?
Please, Mommy.

04:05.892 --> 04:08.764
Please don't make us
go back to that dump.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.601
Our yard isn't that bad.

04:17.515 --> 04:22.391

04:28.470 --> 04:31.109
Kimberly, come on,
we're outdoors now.

04:31.142 --> 04:33.848
You know you've
got to turn it up.

04:33.914 --> 04:37.287
Tylan, I have to take our son
to his soccer practice,

04:37.354 --> 04:41.062
and then you have to take me
to my soccer practice.

04:41.095 --> 04:42.999
But Brendell, my bike
only seats two.

04:42.999 --> 04:44.135
That does it.

04:44.201 --> 04:47.174
I'm serving you papers
at semi-formal.

04:47.241 --> 04:50.046
Those two,
always on the rocks.

04:53.286 --> 04:55.257
Man,
this is the kind of resistance

04:55.290 --> 04:57.494
you just can't get on land.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.906
How long was that?
- Four seconds.

05:02.972 --> 05:04.175
Yes!
New record.

05:04.175 --> 05:07.314
Dunkie, you remember the
first time I took you swimming?

05:07.381 --> 05:10.353
Yes. You tell this story
like 50 times a day.

05:10.387 --> 05:12.892
The beach was packed
for 4th of July.

05:12.959 --> 05:14.161
You walked into the lake.

05:14.195 --> 05:15.665
A fish brushed
against your foot,

05:15.698 --> 05:19.371
and you screamed, "Mommy!"
and you ran out of the water.

05:19.405 --> 05:22.411
- I was there, Mom.
- I'm not done.

05:22.512 --> 05:25.885
But your trunks were too big,
so they came right off,

05:25.952 --> 05:27.956
and there was it was,
your itty-bitty,

05:28.022 --> 05:31.964
teeny-weeny button
for all of Oakdale to see.

05:32.030 --> 05:33.132
Remember that, Jack?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.603
Remember what, honey?

05:34.636 --> 05:37.509
The beach was packed
for the 4th of July.

05:37.542 --> 05:39.813
Dunkie walked into the lake,
and a fish--

05:39.846 --> 05:42.886
All of Oakdale
saw Duncan's button.

05:47.729 --> 05:49.398
Sup?

05:49.431 --> 05:53.239
<i>Whoa, man, where are you?
Hawaii? I'm jealous.</i>

05:53.273 --> 05:54.441
Huh?
Oh, yeah.

05:54.475 --> 05:56.947
Anytime you guys
don't see me, I'm in Hawaii.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.022
<i>Are we hearing
the same fire truck?</i>

06:01.088 --> 06:02.592
What?
No.

grass skirt is burning.

<i>You look kind of cool
by firelight, Duncan.</i>

06:17.589 --> 06:19.593
<i>It makes you look like
you have cheek bones.</i>

06:19.626 --> 06:21.663
<i>I mean, I know they're
not there, but still.</i>

06:21.730 --> 06:24.168
<i>Yeah, you look

06:24.235 --> 06:25.871
<i>Ooh, yeah.
Total Willem Dafoe.</i>

06:25.905 --> 06:29.546
<i>Ladies, ladies,
can we go a day without Dafoe?</i>

Kimber,
can you take over the grill

06:32.484 --> 06:34.288
while these firemen put me out?

06:34.321 --> 06:36.827
- Sweet deck you got here.
- You think so?

06:36.927 --> 06:38.196
Oh, yeah.

06:38.263 --> 06:41.135
I'd trade the lust of every
married woman in town for this.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.607
Hey, Annie.
- Hi, Lance.

06:45.377 --> 06:47.515
Okay, we all had
a fun day trespassing

06:47.548 --> 06:49.218
in our neighbor's yard.
Time for bed.

06:49.285 --> 06:50.855
What about our baths?

06:50.888 --> 06:53.594
That's the beauty of a pool.
Chlorine is nature's soap.

06:53.661 --> 06:55.631
Is it also nature's
toothpaste?

06:55.665 --> 06:57.835
It's nature's everything. Goodnight.

06:57.902 --> 06:58.871
all: Whoo-hoo!

06:59.004 --> 07:02.344
Slow down, big boy.
We're going skinny dipping.

07:02.411 --> 07:04.849
Wow, I thought no bath
was exciting!

07:04.950 --> 07:07.755
You grab the wine, I'll grab
my skinny dipping t-shirt.

07:07.789 --> 07:09.291
I'm having a body judgment day.

07:09.325 --> 07:13.534

<i>Wait, Duncan,
are you still inside?</i>

07:29.231 --> 07:30.735

07:30.801 --> 07:34.809
- Open a window!
- Are you as sleepy as I am?

07:34.843 --> 07:37.014
You're getting carbon
monoxide poisoning.

07:37.047 --> 07:38.917
Stomp it out!

Call you right back.

♪ Pool loving,
and I'm feeling sexy ♪

07:45.998 --> 07:50.608
♪ I got a t-shirt,
and it's down to my knees ♪

07:59.191 --> 08:01.930
Take me to
the deep end, daddy.

08:04.636 --> 08:07.341
- What are you doing here?
- Fire pit cheekbones.

08:07.407 --> 08:08.911
Why are you naked?

08:08.977 --> 08:13.052
Hope you brought the skinny,
'cause I brought the dip.

08:13.086 --> 08:14.856
Oh!
Ugh!

08:19.465 --> 08:20.801
Poor Dunkie.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.339
Why was it so important
to go skinny dipping?

08:23.406 --> 08:26.045
Why didn't I wear
a weird oversized M&M

08:26.112 --> 08:27.582
Store man dress like you?

08:27.615 --> 08:29.018
Honey, don't
beat yourself up.

08:29.051 --> 08:32.190
You were naked and mistakenly
propositioned your son.

08:32.224 --> 08:33.459
It happens.

08:33.493 --> 08:35.463
But he looked so traumatized.

08:35.531 --> 08:36.967
Like that time at Disneyland,

08:37.034 --> 08:39.873
when he saw Jiminy Cricket
smoking in the men's room.

08:39.906 --> 08:42.879
Relax, Annie.
Kids see so much crazy stuff

08:42.912 --> 08:46.085
on the internet these days,
it washes right over them.

08:50.528 --> 08:51.997
I'm not my mother's daddy.

08:52.030 --> 08:54.836
I'm not my mother's daddy.
Why isn't this working?

08:54.903 --> 08:59.278
I'm tear-free, daddy.

09:01.750 --> 09:05.791
- I'm a three-way bulb.
- Why are you telling me that?

09:08.964 --> 09:12.304
Oh, thank God, a G-rated room.
Can I sleep in here?

09:12.370 --> 09:15.511
Sure. Want to play Barbies?
Today's laundry day.

09:15.544 --> 09:18.584
My delicates are in the wash.

09:22.124 --> 09:24.562
I see trauma.

09:28.436 --> 09:29.873
Come on, Mom.
It's our last day

09:29.939 --> 09:32.043
with Helen's yard.
We're having a pool party.

09:32.077 --> 09:33.814
Yeah, everyone's
gonna be there.

09:33.847 --> 09:37.855
Bradley, Lil Joey--that's
all the people I know.

09:37.922 --> 09:40.661
I'm not really in
a bathing suit mood today.

09:40.694 --> 09:41.596
Is this about Duncan
seeing you naked?

09:41.630 --> 09:43.867
Dad told us.
You definitely scarred him.

09:43.934 --> 09:45.170
To the deck!

09:45.236 --> 09:47.441
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

09:47.474 --> 09:49.311
Come on, honey.

09:49.378 --> 09:50.681
Helen will be home
in a few hours,

09:50.714 --> 09:52.785
and this is my only chance
to be king of the deck.

09:52.819 --> 09:54.856
They might even
burger toast me.

09:54.956 --> 09:58.196
Sorry, but I don't want
my naked encounter with Duncan

09:58.262 --> 09:59.599
to become a thing between us.

09:59.666 --> 10:02.638
He has to come down
those stairs sometime.

10:12.859 --> 10:15.196
My own son can't
even look at me.

10:15.263 --> 10:16.633
Yeah, devastating.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.402
Anyhoo, if you change your mind
about my deck party,

10:18.469 --> 10:22.177
I got Jarts.
They're illegal.

10:25.618 --> 10:27.855
So, you saw your mom
full frontal?

10:27.922 --> 10:30.528
And my dad's ass.

10:30.594 --> 10:32.632
And then my mom ran
to get a towel,

10:32.698 --> 10:35.571
but that just activated
the backyard spotlight.

10:35.638 --> 10:38.944
Slow down. So, you saw
your mom's everything?

10:39.044 --> 10:40.180
Everything.

10:40.246 --> 10:43.854
Sometimes it can help to talk
about these things slowly.

10:43.887 --> 10:45.724
I know it was a shock,
but it's kind of cute

10:45.758 --> 10:48.797
your parents
still have romantic rendezvous.

10:48.864 --> 10:51.770
What? I'm just trying to put
a nice spin on a gross story.

10:51.837 --> 10:53.907
I'll get over this
eventually, right?

10:53.941 --> 10:56.011
Oh, no, this is gonna
jack you up for life.

10:56.078 --> 10:58.884
Yeah, you can't unsee
your mom's frisbees.

10:58.917 --> 11:01.388
I saw my mom naked once,
and I tell everyone I meet.

11:01.488 --> 11:02.825
Would you like to meet my mom?

11:02.892 --> 11:05.898
Get out of here, man.
I've warned you so many times.

11:05.965 --> 11:08.704
I'm just gonna avoid her
until I go to college.

11:08.737 --> 11:12.712
Oh, no! I'm gonna have
to go to college!

11:12.745 --> 11:15.651
Okay, burgers cooking,
beers chilling,

11:15.718 --> 11:17.387
potato salad spoiling.

11:17.454 --> 11:19.391
Am I forgetting anything,
Kimber?

11:19.458 --> 11:22.163
- Fun?
- What do you mean?

11:22.230 --> 11:23.734
This party sucks, Dad.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.270
Everyone's just
standing around.

11:25.303 --> 11:27.942
Jing's making small talk
with Mayor Jen.

11:28.009 --> 11:31.282
Anyway, that's the summer
my husband left me for a man.

11:31.348 --> 11:32.718
What's your deal?

11:32.785 --> 11:36.225
I can talk like a robot.
Beep, beep, boop-bop.

11:36.258 --> 11:37.929
I don't care for that.

11:37.995 --> 11:39.933
I hope someone's house
catches fire,

11:39.966 --> 11:42.270
so I can leave
without being rude.

11:42.337 --> 11:44.141
You and me both, beefcake.

11:44.208 --> 11:46.713
I thought your dream
was to be a weird deck guy.

11:46.746 --> 11:50.521
It is! That's why I did
everything in this book!

11:50.554 --> 11:53.426
Give me that.
The problem is you have

11:53.459 --> 11:56.566
a big deck, but you don't
have big deck energy.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.806
- You are saying "deck," right?
- Uh-huh.

You feel me?

12:43.927 --> 12:46.533
Duncan? It's me.
We need to talk.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.735
Are you decent?

12:47.835 --> 12:49.973
Oh, I'm wearing my butt
crack leggings.

12:50.006 --> 12:52.612
Hold on a sec.
I think we should talk

12:52.712 --> 12:55.718
so things
don't get weird between us.

12:55.751 --> 12:57.087
Oh, for Pete's sake, Dunkie,

12:57.120 --> 12:59.024
I know it was strange
because I'm your mom.

12:59.091 --> 13:01.930
But if we were
of the Swedish culture,

13:01.963 --> 13:04.502
we would see each other naked
all the time--

13:04.569 --> 13:06.840
in the sauna,
at dinner, at IKEA.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.777
Mom, you're ruining IKEA!

13:08.810 --> 13:09.946
You know that's
my favorite restaurant!

13:10.079 --> 13:13.419
You know, cavemen would see
their moms naked all the time.

13:13.452 --> 13:15.123
Did you think about
the cavemen, Duncan?

13:15.189 --> 13:17.027
Of course I thought
about the cavemen!

13:17.127 --> 13:19.398
You're making a big deal
out of nothing.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.670
This will just be
one of your many funny,

13:21.736 --> 13:23.039
embarrassing stories

13:23.072 --> 13:26.445
that you enjoy me
telling to total strangers.

13:26.478 --> 13:28.182
- Please leave.
- Okay.

13:28.215 --> 13:30.788
But I'm just gonna leave this
book of Renaissance paintings,

13:30.821 --> 13:33.326
in case you're curious about--

13:33.359 --> 13:35.496
Just go!

13:35.564 --> 13:36.866
Hey, Siri, how do I get

13:36.933 --> 13:38.169
something horrible
out of my head?

13:38.235 --> 13:42.110
<i>There are six jart
removal locations nearby.</i>

13:42.177 --> 13:43.914
No, seeing my mom naked.

13:43.947 --> 13:45.718
<i>Searching "naked moms."</i>

13:45.784 --> 13:47.588
No!
Just forget it.

13:47.655 --> 13:49.792
<i>Searching "forget it."</i>

13:49.826 --> 13:52.330
That's it!

13:55.504 --> 13:57.240
Dunkie!

13:57.340 --> 13:59.277
Leave me alone.

14:02.918 --> 14:04.956
Wow, naked mom at the pool.

14:05.023 --> 14:07.995
Well, Freud said trauma
starts with the mama.

14:08.062 --> 14:11.135
Whatever. Just help me stop
seeing my mom's frisbees.

14:11.201 --> 14:13.039
Okay.
But before I wipe the memory,

14:13.105 --> 14:16.546
you must read these seven pages
of risks and sign--

14:16.613 --> 14:18.349
- Wipe me.
- It's not that simple.

14:18.382 --> 14:20.219
You must find the memory
of your mother

14:20.253 --> 14:22.925
and remove it
without disturbing the others.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.929
Memories are interconnected.

14:24.962 --> 14:26.766
Like this metal pin
on my chair.

14:26.833 --> 14:30.173
You pull it out,
the whole thing collapses.

14:30.206 --> 14:32.310
I gotta think of another way
to demonstrate that.

14:32.410 --> 14:33.479
Yeah, yeah.

14:33.513 --> 14:34.816
If I need to remember
something important,

14:34.882 --> 14:36.720
Facebook will send me
a notification.

14:36.753 --> 14:38.890
You want your $20 or not?

14:43.232 --> 14:45.369
You're in a hallway
lined with doors.

14:45.436 --> 14:48.810
Behind each door are
your most significant memories.

14:48.844 --> 14:51.381
Largest poops.

14:51.448 --> 14:55.089
Don't get distracted.
Find the door that says "Mom."

14:56.893 --> 14:59.832
Got it.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.370
Are those too tight
in the crotch?

15:02.437 --> 15:03.507
Zip me up, Dunkie.

15:03.573 --> 15:04.742
Blast!

15:04.776 --> 15:06.613
Someone's going
through puberty.

15:06.679 --> 15:07.948
And that's where
babies come from.

15:07.982 --> 15:10.453
Suppository!
Nocturnal emissions!

15:10.554 --> 15:12.792
Take me to the deep end, daddy.

15:13.192 --> 15:16.131
- Die, memory, die.
- Hot flash!

15:16.231 --> 15:19.204
Just use the girls' room.
Teeny-weeny button.

15:19.271 --> 15:21.543
Kiss your grandma.
Butt crack leggings.

15:21.609 --> 15:23.613
Crunchy sock.
Foreskin!

15:23.647 --> 15:26.118
Yeah! Smoked her.
Ba-bam!

15:26.185 --> 15:28.557
Dude, you gotta release this
for PlayStation.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.527
Am I cured?
- That depends.

15:30.561 --> 15:33.132
What do these frisbees
make you think of?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.604
- Dogs?
- You're cured.

15:35.637 --> 15:37.775
Yes!
You saved my life.

15:37.842 --> 15:40.346
And I got this sweet keychain.

15:42.016 --> 15:44.454
Is this the jart
removal place?

15:44.488 --> 15:45.824
No, that's next door.

15:45.891 --> 15:47.995
All right.
Thank you.

15:51.903 --> 15:54.007
Deck guy says, "Move right."

15:54.040 --> 15:56.245
Deck guy says, "Move left."

15:56.311 --> 15:58.149
Deck guy keeps it tight.

15:58.215 --> 16:01.155
- Deck guy, he don't mess.
- Deck guy.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.292
Touch the sky!

16:03.359 --> 16:06.498
I love dancing to songs
that have instructions.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.637
You're white, Jack.
Of course you do.

16:08.670 --> 16:10.072
Dad, I'm so proud of you.

16:10.106 --> 16:12.310
I'm gonna do something
I've never done before.

16:12.377 --> 16:15.383
Hey, everyone, this is my dad!

16:16.820 --> 16:19.992
All right, everyone raise
your burgers in the air...

16:20.059 --> 16:24.067
Oh my God, here it comes.
The burger toast.

16:24.134 --> 16:26.773
To my man, Jack,
the king of the--

16:26.840 --> 16:28.810
Hey, are you Big Deck Jack?

16:28.844 --> 16:30.346
If the apron fits.

16:30.413 --> 16:32.818
We saw your party on
Porch Weekly's Instagram feed.

16:32.852 --> 16:34.120
Okay if we join?

16:34.187 --> 16:38.028
Sure, I'll throw two
more portobels on the rack.

16:38.095 --> 16:42.738
Hey, the old jerk said okay.

16:43.707 --> 16:44.909
Uh-oh.

16:44.942 --> 16:47.013
We're gonna need
a bigger deck.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.353
Sup, Mom? What's for lunch?

16:50.386 --> 16:53.994
Sandwich. Wait, Duncan,
you're looking at me.

16:54.060 --> 16:56.966
Yeah, why wouldn't I?
Extra mayo, please.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.371
So, the incident
over at Helen's?

16:59.404 --> 17:00.473
Oh.

17:00.607 --> 17:03.345
I know something happened,
but can't remember what it was.

17:03.412 --> 17:04.715
So, we cool.

17:04.782 --> 17:08.389
Oh, Dunkie, it is so nice
to have my baby boy back.

17:08.422 --> 17:11.495
I was worried we were
never gonna have any fun times

17:11.563 --> 17:12.665
together again.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.537
Like that 4th of July.
The beach was packed.

17:15.571 --> 17:18.910
You walked into the lake, and a
fish brushed against your foot.

17:18.977 --> 17:21.481
And--hey, you're not
rolling your eyes at me.

17:21.549 --> 17:22.417
Why would I?

17:22.585 --> 17:24.789
You heard it a million times,
and you hate it.

17:24.855 --> 17:25.991
What's wrong with you?

17:26.058 --> 17:28.262
Nothing. I just paid
some brain dude

17:28.295 --> 17:31.068
to let me go ham on memories
I don't want.

17:31.134 --> 17:35.042
"Go ham"?
You went ham on your brain?

17:35.109 --> 17:36.345
So, do you remember

17:36.411 --> 17:38.249
what happened
at your sixth birthday party?

17:38.282 --> 17:41.188
- I turned six?
- Now, the clown scared you,

17:41.221 --> 17:43.325
and I beat him
with his giant shoe!

17:43.392 --> 17:47.568
And you started giggling and
clapping, and it was adorable.

17:47.601 --> 17:49.070
Sounds funny.
Wish I was there.

17:49.137 --> 17:52.076
You were there!
Oh, my God!

17:52.143 --> 17:54.414
You destroyed our memories.

17:54.447 --> 17:55.951
Just the embarrassing ones.

17:56.018 --> 17:57.788
Who cares?
- I care!

17:57.821 --> 18:01.161
After I saved you from
that fish on the 4th of July,

18:01.194 --> 18:02.932
you colored me
a thank you note,

18:02.998 --> 18:05.036
and it was the first time
you ever wrote

18:05.102 --> 18:07.775
"I love you, Mommy."

18:07.841 --> 18:10.346
I called it a "pish."

18:10.379 --> 18:13.052
Those moments embarrass you
now because you're a teenager.

18:13.085 --> 18:14.555
But they're precious.

18:14.588 --> 18:16.458
You would have seen
that one day.

18:16.491 --> 18:20.399
You just didn't erase memories.
You erased us.

18:22.905 --> 18:25.811
My first new memory,
and it sucks.

18:26.144 --> 18:28.717
Helen's gonna be
home any minute.

18:28.750 --> 18:30.988
Everybody, please go,
and if you could each

18:31.054 --> 18:34.260
just pick up one piece of trash
on the way out.

18:37.568 --> 18:39.204
I know we should do
something about that,

18:39.237 --> 18:41.876
but my shift ended
five minutes ago.

18:42.578 --> 18:45.149
both: Whoa! Ahh!

18:45.249 --> 18:47.420
- Ow!
- Dad, do something!

18:47.487 --> 18:50.159
Mr. Mitch,
how do I stop this party?

18:50.226 --> 18:52.030
Sorry, I just know
how to get them started.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.568
Stopping them is a cop thing.

18:54.635 --> 18:57.340
Excuse me, college kids,
bad news.

18:57.373 --> 18:59.979
I gotta shut it down.
- Shut it down?

19:00.012 --> 19:01.983
I thought you were
Big Deck Jack.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.787
You're right.
Carry on.

19:08.162 --> 19:11.803
- She's going down!
- Thank you for having us.

19:11.869 --> 19:13.405
- Jump, Dad!
- No!

19:13.506 --> 19:16.178
I've got to go down
with the deck.

19:21.889 --> 19:23.893
- Helen's home!
- What do we do?

19:23.960 --> 19:25.964
There's only one thing
we can do.

19:25.997 --> 19:28.870
- Run like hell?
- Language, and yes!

19:31.208 --> 19:33.212
You wiped all
my childhood memories,

19:33.278 --> 19:35.449
and now my mom
is sobbing into a sandwich.

19:35.517 --> 19:38.322
No, you wiped
your childhood memories.

19:38.389 --> 19:41.328
What did I say about pulling
the pin in the chair, Duncan?

19:41.361 --> 19:42.296
I know, I know,

19:42.363 --> 19:44.367
but you put your chair
back together, right?

19:44.401 --> 19:46.706
No, I buy
a new one every time.

19:46.773 --> 19:48.475
There has to be something
I can do.

19:48.543 --> 19:51.916
There may be one way,
but it's highly controversial.

19:51.983 --> 19:54.320
I'll do anything.

19:54.387 --> 19:55.891
I have to do what?

20:02.103 --> 20:04.174
Did you lose your mind
with those memories?

20:04.240 --> 20:05.309
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry!

20:05.342 --> 20:07.781
I felt awful that
I made you cry,

20:07.815 --> 20:08.917
and the doctor said

20:08.983 --> 20:10.352
the only way
to get my memories back

20:10.419 --> 20:13.292
was to recreate the horror
of seeing you naked.

20:13.325 --> 20:17.668
- Did it work?
- It was the 4th of July.

20:17.701 --> 20:19.204
Beach was packed.

20:19.237 --> 20:21.241
That's right.
Then what happened?

20:21.308 --> 20:23.680
A pish touched my foot.

20:23.713 --> 20:26.485
- Uh-huh.
- I ran out of the water.

20:26.552 --> 20:30.192
Lost my shorts.
And everyone saw my...

20:30.226 --> 20:32.130
both: Itty-bitty,
teeny-weeny button.

20:32.196 --> 20:34.635
- Dunkie, you did it!
- I 'membered!

20:34.668 --> 20:37.440
So, that's why you barged
into my showed!

20:37.541 --> 20:41.749
Thank you so much for that
touching and intrusive gesture.

20:43.085 --> 20:44.421
Hey, can this be a story

20:44.487 --> 20:46.358
we just keep to ourselves
until we die?

20:46.425 --> 20:48.696
Oh, yeah.
I'm not even telling your dad.

20:52.136 --> 20:53.773
Okay, Helen,
we're walking down

20:53.807 --> 20:55.309
a long flight of stairs,

20:55.376 --> 20:56.712
and when we get to the bottom,

20:56.746 --> 20:58.917
we're gonna be
inside your mind.

20:58.950 --> 21:00.319
Okay.

21:00.386 --> 21:01.789
Dad, do you really thinking
this is gonna work?

21:01.889 --> 21:04.995
The only other option we have
is to move or kill Helen,

21:05.029 --> 21:06.799
and your mom said no to both.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.404
Your deck was destroyed
by a meteor,

21:09.471 --> 21:11.208
and you want to build
an even bigger

21:11.274 --> 21:13.980
and better one
to share with your neighbors.

21:14.013 --> 21:15.483
Okay.

21:15.517 --> 21:18.055
And you give us presents
on Christmas and every day,

21:18.088 --> 21:19.324
just because.

21:19.357 --> 21:21.529
- Okay.
- You'll let me throw my

21:21.562 --> 21:24.535
Sweet Sixteen here,
and my Dirty Thirty.

21:24.602 --> 21:25.604
Okay.

21:25.670 --> 21:28.408
And you're no longer
attracted to Duncan.

21:28.442 --> 21:31.348
Like hell.
