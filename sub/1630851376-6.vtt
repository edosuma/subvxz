17:06.523 --> 17:08.385
There's no conflict, no debate,
unlike my family--

17:08.485 --> 17:11.027
Whoa-kay.

17:11.127 --> 17:12.749
Do we like hanging out
with my family?

17:12.849 --> 17:15.271
- No. Maybe.

17:15.371 --> 17:18.475
- I mean, we fight,
but at least it's interesting.

17:18.575 --> 17:20.597
- Oh, my God.
We're friends with your family.

17:20.697 --> 17:21.958
- Tom!
- Oh--

17:22.058 --> 17:23.640
- Have you checked out the new
All Wings cross-trainer?

17:23.740 --> 17:24.761
- It's great.
It's like running on air.

17:24.861 --> 17:26.402
We got to get going.

17:26.502 --> 17:28.084
- Cookies?
- This was fun.

17:28.184 --> 17:30.647
- So great meeting you.
- Let's do it again.

17:30.747 --> 17:32.408
- Oh, it was our pleasure.

17:32.508 --> 17:35.011
- If they reach out, we'll just
say we're busy with kid stuff.

17:35.111 --> 17:36.773
- Oh, that was torture.

17:36.873 --> 17:40.937
If they ask us over, let's just
say we're busy with kid stuff.

[spooky music]

17:43.159 --> 17:46.863
- I got a box of French
truffles, Swiss caramels.

17:46.963 --> 17:49.946
Dad, is Dogecoin
worth anything?

17:50.046 --> 17:52.588
- It depends on the market,
sweetie.

17:52.688 --> 17:56.472
- What's wrong, Daddy?
- Nothing. I just--

17:56.572 --> 17:59.996
I thought we'd get at least
one T-and-T-er tonight.

18:00.096 --> 18:02.318
I think our house
is too far from the road.

18:02.418 --> 18:04.640
- Aunt Sarah says
our landscaping is hostile.

18:16.872 --> 18:19.695
- Just checking in to see
how the other half Halloweens.

18:19.795 --> 18:21.857

weren't fun?

18:21.957 --> 18:23.659
- Oh, we had the best time.

18:23.759 --> 18:24.900
- Oh, so fun.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.002
No tears at all.

18:28.724 --> 18:30.726

18:34.209 --> 18:37.473
Oh, my God, that's so cool.

18:37.573 --> 18:39.074
- Yeah,
so I'm not going to lie.

18:39.174 --> 18:42.397
Trick-or-treating with Emily
was a little tough.

18:42.497 --> 18:45.400
Kind of wish we had
all been together.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.002
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

18:47.102 --> 18:49.364

something?

18:51.506 --> 18:53.368
- Hmm?
- Do you have orange wine?

18:53.468 --> 18:55.931
- What's that?
Sounds gross.

18:56.031 --> 18:58.934
- Halloween isn't usually
a sentimental holiday.

18:59.034 --> 19:01.777
That's reserved for Christmas
or Thanksgiving

19:01.877 --> 19:03.618
or a drunken Fourth of July.

19:03.718 --> 19:07.422

lollipops for the Dogecoin.

19:07.522 --> 19:09.985

of all common sense,

this family didn't just need
to spend time together.

19:22.657 --> 19:24.159
They actually liked to.

It's an exact replica.

19:27.021 --> 19:28.723

19:28.823 --> 19:30.845
I made mine,

And, yeah,
I know what you're thinking.

J.A.R.V.I.S. is the one
who actually made it.

But who made J.A.R.V.I.S., huh?

so bad right now.

- No, seriously, sit down.
I can make some space.

I physically can't. I tried.

19:52.647 --> 19:54.148

the worst thing

19:55.369 --> 19:56.671

a little bit.

these sugar-crazed monsters?
