WEBVTT

00:32.949 --> 00:34.451
She said, "No, Mrs. Hill,

00:34.534 --> 00:36.953
this is advanced placement Latin."

00:37.037 --> 00:40.707
And I said, "Well then,
what's Latin for 'my bad?'"

00:41.833 --> 00:44.669
Mom, you kill me.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.087
-

00:46.171 --> 00:47.005
Hello.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.174
Yes... Right...

00:50.008 --> 00:51.509
Okay, fine, then.

00:51.593 --> 00:52.761
Thank you.

00:58.349 --> 01:00.685
-Telemarketer?
No. It was my mother.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.479
Your mother?

01:02.562 --> 01:05.398
-Wow, what's it been, 20 years?
Mm-hmm.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.566
Well, what did she say?

01:06.649 --> 01:08.985
She wants us to come
to the ranch this weekend.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.111
In Montana?

01:10.195 --> 01:11.321
-Mm-hmm.
-Really?

01:11.404 --> 01:14.407
Do you think you could knock it off
with all the personal questions, Hank?

01:14.491 --> 01:17.035
All you ever do is grill me
about my emotional life,

01:17.118 --> 01:19.662
pushing and prodding me
to talk about my feelings.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.791
It's like living
with Barbara freakin' Walters.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.838
The nerve. She spends
my whole childhood criticizing me,

01:28.922 --> 01:30.590
and my whole adulthood ignoring me.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.967
Now she wants me to visit? What for?

01:33.218 --> 01:34.636
Well, I know it's unpleasant,

01:34.719 --> 01:37.138
but have you considered
that she might be, uh,

01:37.555 --> 01:39.474
you know... dying?

01:40.517 --> 01:41.476
No chance.

01:41.559 --> 01:42.977
Dying is not her style.

01:43.353 --> 01:45.313
That would be a sign of weakness.

01:46.648 --> 01:50.485
You know, I think this
not-having-contact-with-your-mother thing

01:50.568 --> 01:51.945
might have a downside.

01:52.028 --> 01:53.738
Don't be ridiculous. It's been great.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.699
I think you've allowed your imagination
to run wild.

01:56.991 --> 02:00.703
In your head, your mom's become
some kind of crazy evil spirit

02:00.787 --> 02:02.997
with the power of eternal life.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.416
But really, she's just an old,
tired, cattle-rancher woman

02:05.500 --> 02:06.793
who misses her daughter,

02:06.876 --> 02:08.586
and wants to make peace.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.296
That's why she called you tonight.

02:10.880 --> 02:14.425
Yep. That old cow's
just looking for her calf.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.803
My God, Hank. Of course.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.889
You really are an emotional genius,
aren't you?

02:20.223 --> 02:23.143
You really are my Barbara Walters.

02:24.602 --> 02:27.272
I've been waiting 20 years for this trip.

02:27.772 --> 02:30.400
Montana. It even sounds rugged.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.569
I almost threw up once in Montana.

02:33.069 --> 02:34.362
I made it to Idaho.

02:34.445 --> 02:37.782
Making it out of the car
would have been the real accomplishment.

02:38.533 --> 02:39.951
So I've already decided.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.579
This is where Bobby
will spend his summers.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.665
Every fall, he'll come back taller
and hardier

02:45.748 --> 02:48.835
and maybe, maybe
just a little bit quieter.

02:51.212 --> 02:52.839
Well, I better go pack.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.553
Whoa, Boomhauer, you're taking this well.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.145
Purple mountain's majesty.

03:07.687 --> 03:10.148
Is there anything fun to do around here?

03:10.231 --> 03:13.359
Bobby, there's nowhere more fun
in all of America.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.570
They've got horses and tractors,

03:15.695 --> 03:17.739
and people who know
how to grow their own food

03:17.822 --> 03:19.115
and fix their own roofs.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.283
You want fun?

03:20.366 --> 03:25.038
You're standing in a five-ring circus
of simplicity and self-reliance.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.372
Uh-oh.

03:26.664 --> 03:29.375
Uh, that's your rental there in space 62.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.754
No, no, that's one of those Rovers.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.423
-I'm supposed to have a pickup.
-We're all out.

03:35.506 --> 03:37.091
But this is a nicer vehicle,

03:37.175 --> 03:39.052
and you'll get the same price
as the pickup.

03:39.135 --> 03:41.137
Uh-huh, but I'm not interested in hav...

03:41.221 --> 03:43.056
It's the only car we have right now.

03:52.774 --> 03:57.320
This is the most beautiful
got-dang sight I have ever seen.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.701
Oh, my God. There's Mom.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.206
You know, I wasn't completely sure
until now,

04:08.289 --> 04:09.832
but you were right, Hank.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.126
I mean, look at her.
Look at the way she moves.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.421
That is a different woman
than the one I grew up with.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.465
Yes. There's a tenderness now.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.633
I can see it.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.803
Hank, thank you for making me do this.

04:29.060 --> 04:29.894
Oh.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.604
Oh, Mom.

04:31.688 --> 04:32.605
What?

04:40.697 --> 04:43.074
So, Mom, at the risk of boasting,

04:43.157 --> 04:45.159
I've become quite a little success.

04:45.743 --> 04:49.038
I won the Substitute Teacher
of the Year Award, three years in a row.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.248
Well, how about that?

04:50.623 --> 04:51.582
What was your subject,

04:51.666 --> 04:54.460
"How To Avoid A Life
of Working With Your Hands"?

04:55.878 --> 04:57.463
No, it was Spanish.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.924
Uh-huh. What do you think about it, Doc?

05:00.008 --> 05:02.802
You ever have a use
for a substitute teacher?

05:04.053 --> 05:05.054
Well...

05:10.184 --> 05:15.523
I suppose I can't tell you much
that them mountains can't tell you better.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.194
What's Grandpa talking about?

05:20.486 --> 05:22.280
It didn't make any sense.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.741
That's the talk of an old cowboy, son.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.075
And you'll see someday,

05:26.159 --> 05:29.078
it's the only kind of talk
that does make sense.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.545
She's just as cold and mean
and critical as she ever was.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.422
Ugh, this is so hard.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.258
Hank, you can never let me
become my mother.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.093
Bobby, from this day forward,

05:44.177 --> 05:46.596
-I will coddle you.
-All right.

05:49.265 --> 05:50.391
Morning, fellas.

05:50.475 --> 05:52.435
Thought I'd give you guys a hand today.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.187
If you like.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.738
Are you sure you wouldn't rather
just polish your Rover or something?

06:03.821 --> 06:06.282
Oh, believe me, I didn't want it.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.035
I asked for a pickup,
but that was all they had.

06:09.118 --> 06:11.120
Whatever you say, Hollywood.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.456
So, uh, what are we doing first?

06:14.040 --> 06:16.709
He's got the lump jaw.
Gotta drain the abscess.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.839
We're gonna need another bucket.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.388
Mom, I know that you and I
have some real talking to do...

06:28.471 --> 06:30.014
See that cow over there?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.057
She's calving.

06:31.140 --> 06:33.184
It's coming out backwards.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.397
Tie her head to the wall, keep her still.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.357
-I'm on it.
-And hold my wedding ring.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.026
All right, I got the chains on.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.362
Get back here and help me pull.

06:44.445 --> 06:46.989
One, two, three... go.

06:50.827 --> 06:51.994
He's out!

06:54.122 --> 06:55.790
Oh, will you look at that.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.918
It has been a long time
since I've seen that sight.

06:59.502 --> 07:03.506
I see it hundreds of times a year
and it never stops amazing me.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.383
Can you believe it's been 20 years,

07:05.466 --> 07:08.344
and I still calved a breech
without missing a beat?

07:08.719 --> 07:10.304
That's cause you did what I told you.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.223
If you'd been out on the range
by yourself,

07:12.306 --> 07:13.808
that calf would still be in there.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.521
You ruined my childhood.

07:18.813 --> 07:20.481
Oh, it's all about you, isn't it?

07:20.565 --> 07:23.776
Why didn't you ever do
one damn thing I asked you to?

07:23.860 --> 07:26.195
Why didn't you marry that boy
from across the road?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.156
Sven Grammersdorf?

07:28.239 --> 07:29.866
The alfalfa farmer's son?

07:29.949 --> 07:31.951
He was a decent man from good stock.

07:32.034 --> 07:34.370
Well, I did not have feelings for him,
Mom.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.538
No one asked you to.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.249
We were trying to run a ranch,
not a "feelings" factory.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.877
If you'd married Sven,
we'd be doing all right.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.838
But you ran away.
And now we're all paying for it.

07:43.921 --> 07:45.631
What are you talking about?

07:45.715 --> 07:49.510
I invited you here so you could take
a last look at your childhood home.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.512
We're losing the ranch.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.806
Wha... You're losing the ranch?

07:53.890 --> 07:55.725
Well, I... I don't know what to say.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.478
How about "sorry"? It's all your fault.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.772
You and people like Henry Winkler.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.776
Henry Winkler?

08:06.819 --> 08:08.029
Howdy.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.032
The Fonz?

08:11.324 --> 08:12.783
So, how's it going with your mom?

08:13.034 --> 08:14.494
We're losing the ranch.

08:14.577 --> 08:15.995
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.623
Oh, and that's Henry Winkler.

08:18.706 --> 08:19.999
Howdy.

08:20.541 --> 08:23.669
What the hell is going on around here?

08:26.547 --> 08:28.466
See that trail leading up
into the mountains?

08:28.549 --> 08:30.551
That's where we send the cows every April.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.386
-For spring grazing, right?
-Yep.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.597
See, it's not legally our property.

08:34.680 --> 08:37.517
The Grammersdorfs kindly shared it
with us for 50 years,

08:37.600 --> 08:42.188
but their boy, Sven, moved to Seattle,
so they sold the place to Henry Winkler,

08:43.606 --> 08:45.149
and he won't let us use the trail.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.902
Cows were supposed to head up there
this week.

08:48.444 --> 08:51.531
Thanks to old man Winkler,
they've got nowhere to go.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.575
Well, why would a guy like him
even be living out here?

08:54.659 --> 08:56.869
All you Hollywood folks are moving here.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.287
You burn out on city life,

08:58.412 --> 09:00.748
you come out here,
see all this wide-open space,

09:00.831 --> 09:02.833
and you start making fancy pizzas.

09:02.917 --> 09:05.419
Fellows, look,
you have every right to be mad,

09:05.503 --> 09:08.256
but for the record,
I'm not from Hollywood.

09:08.339 --> 09:09.966
I'm from Arlen, Texas.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.926
Arlen. New York. Hollywood.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.973
Well, why don't you just rent the trail
from Henry Winkler?

09:17.056 --> 09:17.890
We're broke.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.810
You Hollywood folks made property taxes
skyrocket.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.104
You got any more questions,
Stevie Spielberg?

09:23.187 --> 09:26.065
Dang it, I am not Steven Spielberg.

09:26.148 --> 09:27.858
Well, I respectfully disagree.

09:29.151 --> 09:32.655
And then he told me that you can't even
buy groceries in town anymore.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.575
It's all been taken over
by gourmet restaurants

09:35.658 --> 09:36.659
and...

09:36.742 --> 09:37.785
...day spas.

09:37.868 --> 09:39.537
Yeah, well, that's progress, I guess.

09:39.620 --> 09:42.164
What do you mean?
Aren't you upset by this?

09:42.248 --> 09:45.751
I cannot wait to wave a last goodbye
to this place.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.712
What about this saddle?

09:47.795 --> 09:50.548
Are you telling me this doesn't
bring back any good memories?

09:50.631 --> 09:53.801
Of course. It reminds me of Missoula,

09:53.884 --> 09:55.595
my old gelding horse.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.598
Mom made me castrate him myself.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.104
<i>Man, this place is boring.</i>

10:06.063 --> 10:07.898
<i>-Nothing happens here.</i>

10:08.983 --> 10:12.153
<i>I'm gonna try to sleep</i>
<i>for two days straight.</i>

10:13.154 --> 10:15.239
<i>I hope this battery</i><i>lasts the weekend.</i>

10:17.617 --> 10:19.535
Oh, hello.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.166
You want some candy, huh?

10:26.167 --> 10:27.752
Well, I don't blame you.

10:28.210 --> 10:29.503
I've had hay.

10:32.006 --> 10:35.301
Doc, I heard about what's happening
and it breaks my heart.

10:35.926 --> 10:36.969
Well...

10:37.511 --> 10:40.264
I never could figure
what the sky was thinking,

10:41.057 --> 10:44.352
but the soil,
she don't keep too many secrets.

10:45.519 --> 10:48.230
I will never forget you, Doc Platter.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.316
Dang it.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.109
I'm not gonna let this happen.

10:59.700 --> 11:00.743
Well, hi, there.

11:00.826 --> 11:04.413
I don't know you
but I'd absolutely love that to change.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.290
-I'm Henry.
-Hank Hill.

11:06.374 --> 11:11.170
Uh, I'm just up the road, and I, uh,
thought I'd come by for a friendly visit.

11:11.253 --> 11:13.422
Hank, I love that.

11:13.547 --> 11:16.175
That is so... "the West."

11:16.467 --> 11:18.719
I wish the whole world would stop by

11:18.803 --> 11:20.054
for a friendly visit.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.722
Oh, God.

11:22.973 --> 11:23.849
So, uh...

11:23.933 --> 11:26.435
-Henry, the reason I'm here...
-Shh.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.397
Don't you love how peaceful it is here?

11:29.480 --> 11:33.526
You know, back in LA,
my brain just gets... it gets muddy.

11:33.609 --> 11:34.902
The agents and the lawyers

11:34.985 --> 11:37.405
and the paparazzi,
they walk into my skull, and they...

11:37.780 --> 11:39.532
they get dirt in there,
you know what I mean?

11:39.615 --> 11:43.285
-Well, I'm not sure if I...
-That's why I fish.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.620
Well, hey, I fish, too.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.706
Then you understand.

11:46.789 --> 11:51.335
You know, I always say that fishing
is like a washing machine for your brain.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.671
It's so deliciously Zen.

11:53.754 --> 11:57.049
Uh, I think I might do
a different kind of fishing.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.259
Oh, you know what?

11:58.342 --> 12:00.720
Hold on for a second.
I can explain this so much better.

12:03.889 --> 12:06.183
Thelonius Monk.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.394
He must've fished.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.574
I mean, look at that bluff right there.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.075
Perfect for squares.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.202
-Squares?
<i>-The Hollywood Squares.</i>

12:25.286 --> 12:26.704
I'm the executive producer.

12:26.787 --> 12:29.874
Can you imagine Kathie Lee,
Joan and Melissa

12:29.957 --> 12:31.375
and Dom in the giant squares,

12:31.459 --> 12:34.128
gazing out at all this majesty?

12:34.211 --> 12:38.215
And all this majesty
is gazing right back at them.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.800
Well, that's actually

12:39.884 --> 12:42.553
the sort of land-use issue
that I'd like to discuss.

12:42.636 --> 12:46.056
-See, the reason I'm...
-Hank, you and I, we're artists.

12:46.140 --> 12:49.518
It's our job to bring humanity
and nature closer together.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.605
Look, I'm not an artist
and I'm not from Hollywood.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.356
I'm from Arlen, Texas.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.901
Oh, my God, I adore Austin.

12:56.984 --> 12:57.818
Arlen.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.286
Dad, have you seen Bobby?

13:07.995 --> 13:11.290
Well, the way I figure it,

13:11.749 --> 13:14.835
-the grass on a prairie...
-Oh, there he is.

13:18.005 --> 13:18.839
Hey, Mom.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.508
This is Tennessee.

13:20.591 --> 13:23.761
Yeah, that's nice. Look, Bobby,
we've got to pack up and get out of here.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.971
Oh. Okay.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.266
Well, I guess I'll be seeing you.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.357
Did you clean his hooves?

13:37.858 --> 13:40.236
That's one of the most important parts
of grooming a horse.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.988
Oh. Next time, I guess.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.828
Are you sure he won't mind?

13:48.911 --> 13:52.206
Honey, he weighs a thousand pounds.
To him, you're like a hat.

13:57.545 --> 14:00.673
Don't slouch. Straighten up your back.
That's right.

14:00.756 --> 14:03.717
Now go ahead, give him
a little squeeze with your heels.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.638
Hey. We're going.

14:07.721 --> 14:10.307
Tennessee, you're a genius.

14:13.811 --> 14:17.565
So if you'd be willing to open that trail
for just a few days a year,

14:17.648 --> 14:19.358
it would make all the difference.

14:19.441 --> 14:22.403
Hank, have you ever seen the movie
<i>A River Runs Through It?</i>

14:22.486 --> 14:25.614
Can you imagine
if cows just tromped across that river,

14:25.698 --> 14:28.492
getting all tangled up
in the fly-fishing lines?

14:28.784 --> 14:30.744
Now that would be an awful movie.

14:30.828 --> 14:35.499
Uh-huh. Well, the river's over there
and the cattle trail is way over there.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.668
So it seems like you could
let the cattle through

14:37.751 --> 14:38.961
without much of a problem.

14:39.044 --> 14:41.755
Excuse me. It would be a serious problem.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.216
Cows have very dirty feet.

14:44.300 --> 14:45.467
They walk through poo,

14:45.551 --> 14:48.429
and they could track giardia microbes
onto the land,

14:48.512 --> 14:51.390
which could wash into the river
and contaminate the fish.

14:51.473 --> 14:55.561
If there's no fish, Hank,
then what am I washing my brain with?

14:56.437 --> 15:00.107
Look, cows and fish
have gotten along fine for centuries.

15:00.190 --> 15:03.819
Hank, sure I could open the cattle road
and tomorrow there would be steak,

15:04.236 --> 15:08.032
but someday, our children will ask us,
"Where are the trees?"

15:08.115 --> 15:11.160
What they'll ask is,
"Where's the got dang steak?"

15:17.958 --> 15:21.086
Enjoy your celebrity cocktail hour,
Mr. Hollywood?

15:21.170 --> 15:25.424
Dang it. I am sick and tired
of everyone's asinine ideas about me.

15:25.507 --> 15:27.468
I am not some redneck

15:27.551 --> 15:29.386
and I'm not a Hollywood jerk.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.305
I'm something else entirely.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.766
I'm... I'm complicated.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.487
Mom. I did it.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.613
Ho-yeah.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.239
Peggy, let's go home.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.367
I've had it with Henry Winkler,

15:51.450 --> 15:54.244
and I've had it with your family
and this got dang ranch.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.997
Hank, are you insane? Look at that.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.420
Dang that Henry Winkler.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.923
This should've been
the best moment of my life,

16:06.006 --> 16:07.591
and I can't even enjoy it.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.385
Look how happy he is.

16:09.468 --> 16:12.763
Ah. It reminds me of myself at his age.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.224
But I thought you said
you were never happy here.

16:15.307 --> 16:20.104
I just let my awful memories of Mom
cloud my good memories of growing up here.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.772
Well, that's nice.

16:21.855 --> 16:25.192
Anyway, if we hurry,
we can get the 5:45 flight to Dallas.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.735
We can't leave now.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.946
Maybe I didn't marry Sven Grammersdorf,

16:29.029 --> 16:31.198
but I can still save this ranch.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.661
Sven Grammersdorf?

16:39.790 --> 16:41.792
What about our neighbors to the east?

16:41.875 --> 16:43.711
Don't they have an old cattle trail?

16:43.794 --> 16:45.337
You mean the Fondas?

16:46.714 --> 16:49.299
Hey, there's that old white-haired fella
just up to the north.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.885
Looked like he'd spent some years
working outdoors.

16:51.969 --> 16:52.970
Has he got a trail?

16:53.053 --> 16:54.847
Larry David? Good luck.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.598
Got dang it.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.725
Forget it, Peggy.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.685
This place ain't about agriculture
anymore.

16:59.768 --> 17:01.353
The Hollywood folks changed the landscape

17:01.437 --> 17:03.105
and they've changed the laws.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.239
"Ordinance of 1857.

17:12.489 --> 17:15.284
If an act of God or other adverse..."

17:15.993 --> 17:18.662
Typical. You're on vacation for two days,

17:18.746 --> 17:20.831
and you can't stay away from your books.

17:25.836 --> 17:31.050
Uh, Peggy, are you sure this isn't, uh,
you know, a pretty darned bad idea?

17:31.133 --> 17:34.720
Don't you worry. I know what I'm doing
and it is going to work.

17:35.095 --> 17:36.513
You both remember the plan.

17:36.597 --> 17:39.683
Bobby, you stay by me.
Hank, bring up the rear.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.023
Let's ride.

18:00.954 --> 18:03.499
Look, Mommy.

18:03.582 --> 18:04.625
Moo cow.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.634
Ma'am, what are you doing
with a herd of cattle

18:13.717 --> 18:14.760
on a public thoroughfare?

18:14.843 --> 18:16.303
We're heading to the mountains.

18:16.386 --> 18:17.679
We're taking the long route

18:17.763 --> 18:21.016
because our cattle trail has been blocked
by Henry Winkler.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.394
Oh, come on.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.772
I've got people coming for brunch.

18:39.618 --> 18:42.162
Ma'am, I'm sorry you're having
a dispute with your neighbors,

18:42.246 --> 18:43.956
but you can't take it out on the town.

18:44.039 --> 18:46.291
These folks are just trying
to enjoy their vacation.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.961
Well, then, here's some vacation reading
for them.

18:49.044 --> 18:52.714
Article 32C from the Osage County Charter.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.759
"Should a dedicated cattle road
become impassable,

18:55.843 --> 18:58.512
Main Street can serve as a temporary pass

18:58.595 --> 19:01.515
until such time as said road reopens."

19:02.015 --> 19:05.477
This law was made more than 100 years ago.
It doesn't have any meaning now.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.312
Well, it means plenty to us, sir.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.731
So we'll be driving cattle
right through here,

19:09.815 --> 19:11.066
50 head at a time,

19:11.150 --> 19:13.986
until we've got all 2,000
head up in the mountains.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.322
Unless Mr. Winkler
would like to yield his road.

19:23.912 --> 19:26.874
Stampede!

19:33.046 --> 19:34.339
Yee-ha!

19:34.423 --> 19:35.799
Yeah, dogies.

19:40.387 --> 19:43.390
Hank, you crazy cowboy.
What the hell are you guys doing?

19:43.473 --> 19:46.143
Well, right about now,
I'm trying not to die.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.770
Lift up off the saddle.
You won't bounce as much.

19:56.904 --> 20:00.449
Can you believe I got Henry Winkler
to open up this trail?

20:02.034 --> 20:04.912
So what do you think, Mom? Peggy Hill.

20:04.995 --> 20:08.040
Educator, mother, rancher.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.001
You were just fixing the mess you made
in the first place.

20:11.084 --> 20:14.046
And half them cattle in the drive
wasn't branded yet.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.881
We could've lost 'em to rustlers.

20:17.674 --> 20:19.092
Peggy, check this out.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.554
-Hey, where are you going?
-To finish the work around here.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.724
I will castrate, vaccinate,
dehorn and brand

20:25.807 --> 20:28.018
every steer in the herd, by myself.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.269
Peggy, that's crazy.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.187
I don't care.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.940
I'm not stopping until my mother sees
that I'm...

20:33.607 --> 20:36.068
Well, I just thought
that if I saved the ranch,

20:36.151 --> 20:38.570
it would finally make Mom proud of me.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.572
But it didn't.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.824
I'm sorry, Peggy.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.869
If saving the ranch didn't change anything
between you two,

20:45.953 --> 20:46.870
nothing's gonna.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.706
Well, then what did we come here for?

20:49.790 --> 20:56.213
What was the point of this whole
stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid trip?

21:24.783 --> 21:25.867
Hello there.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.995
Mr. Winkler here would like you to know

21:28.078 --> 21:32.040
that it was always his intention
to let the Platters' cattle use his trail.

21:32.457 --> 21:37.546
Because cattle, like jazz music,
feed the soul of America.

21:37.629 --> 21:40.799
And that, uh, if all the leaders
of the world

21:40.882 --> 21:42.426
would just fish together,

21:42.509 --> 21:44.386
the planet would live in harmony.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.096
Thank you, Hank.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.019
-<i>Sven Grammersdorf?</i>
