00:12.779 --> 00:16.545
Tonight, James races a man in wellies,

00:16.616 --> 00:19.107
Richard crashes some motorhomes,

00:19.185 --> 00:22.245
and I close down Manchester airport.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.758
(Applause)

00:31.965 --> 00:34.126
Thank you very much, thank you.

00:34.200 --> 00:36.794
Hello. Hello and welcome.

00:38.271 --> 00:44.699
Now, in a minute, I am going to be reviewing
this new Honda Civic Type R,

00:44.778 --> 00:50.148
but first, let's remind ourselves
what made the old Type R such a hit,

00:50.216 --> 00:54.084
particularly among the sort of young men
who have spiky product in their hair

00:54.154 --> 00:55.951
and communicate by grunting.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.982
- Him, really.
- (Laughter)

01:02.262 --> 01:05.698
To be honest, there was plenty to like
about this car.

01:08.435 --> 01:14.032
Its engine spins so fast,
it generates its own little gravity field.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.769
8,000 rpm.

01:16.843 --> 01:18.970
I'm surprised it doesn't come
with its own moon!

01:22.949 --> 01:26.214
There isn't that much actual power,

01:26.286 --> 01:30.814
but it makes up for that
by being so urgent and so... eager.

01:30.890 --> 01:32.949
If you liken all cars to dogs -

01:33.026 --> 01:35.494
this one is like a pensioner's terrier -

01:35.562 --> 01:38.895
you just open up the door and it's... (Yaps)

01:38.965 --> 01:40.694
Out, over your shoulder.

01:43.670 --> 01:44.830
It handled nicely too.

01:46.005 --> 01:47.939
It feels light and it feels agile.

01:48.007 --> 01:52.068
If you turn into a corner with no power on,
the back slides round,

01:52.145 --> 01:54.739
it's like an old-fashioned Peugeot -
brilliant!

01:56.049 --> 01:57.846
Of course, it's like a tripod -

01:57.917 --> 02:00.909
always one back wheel off the ground.

02:02.956 --> 02:09.156
Yes, I am a little terrier.
I'm cocking my leg now.

02:09.229 --> 02:12.528
But it was the practical stuff
that made this car such a hit.

02:12.599 --> 02:15.659
It was cheaper to buy
than almost all its rivals,

02:15.735 --> 02:17.896
and cheaper to insure.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.170
And because the boot is so big,

02:21.241 --> 02:25.268
there's plenty of space
for a decent pair of speakers -

02:25.345 --> 02:33.081
the most important accessory... for the young
man who made this car... so popular.

02:37.624 --> 02:39.592
(Pumping music drowns out speech)

02:44.063 --> 02:47.726
...ten pints of Stella
and a dollop of chlamydia.

02:56.876 --> 03:01.108
You would imagine then
that the new Type R would be even better.

03:02.148 --> 03:07.450
It's based on the new Civic, so it comes
with funky triangular exhaust tailpipes,

03:07.520 --> 03:09.454
a dashboard from the Romulans,

03:09.522 --> 03:12.548
and door handles from a 1950s fridge.

03:12.625 --> 03:16.789
It's very striking, but like the old model,
it's not that expensive.

03:18.198 --> 03:23.864
This GT version with satnav
and various other luxuries is L18,200.

03:23.937 --> 03:30.137
Equip a Golf GTI to the same level
and it would be a whopping L5,000 more.

03:31.778 --> 03:36.306
Unfortunately, however, from there on in,
things start to go a bit wrong.

03:39.719 --> 03:43.086
This car is bigger and heavier
than the old model,

03:43.156 --> 03:46.887
so, d'you wanna guess
how many more horsepowers it's got?

03:46.960 --> 03:48.723
Thirty?

03:48.795 --> 03:49.819
Forty?

03:49.896 --> 03:52.626
No. One.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.332
One more!

03:57.270 --> 04:01.900
Honda say, that despite this,
this is just as fast as the old car.

04:01.975 --> 04:05.001
They say it'll do naught to 60
in six and a half seconds,

04:05.078 --> 04:09.344
and that flat-out you'll be doing 146,
but from where I'm sitting,

04:09.415 --> 04:12.873
it just doest feel that quick.

04:12.952 --> 04:15.079
The revs just take longer.

04:15.154 --> 04:19.351
It feels like a big car with a small engine.

04:21.361 --> 04:23.352
Then there's the handling.

04:23.429 --> 04:28.833
The old car was a joy in the bends because
it had fully independent rear suspension.

04:28.901 --> 04:32.428
Unfortunately, independent rear suspension
is jolly expensive,

04:32.505 --> 04:35.633
so, in this, it's been replaced
with a simple torsion bar.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.041
That makes the car cheaper to make,

04:39.112 --> 04:41.239
and worse.

04:47.520 --> 04:51.081
I'm not saying it's going to fall over
or hit a tree,

04:51.157 --> 04:55.560
but, all the poise and controllability
that you used to get in the old car,

04:55.628 --> 04:57.994
has just sort of... gone,

04:58.064 --> 05:01.124
and all you get instead is,
oh, I don't know...

05:01.200 --> 05:03.998
about 15 miles of... Look at this -

05:04.070 --> 05:05.162
hideous understeer!

05:10.209 --> 05:15.670
Still, let's see how this new car
gets on in a race against its dad.

05:19.719 --> 05:20.913
(Tires squeal)

05:24.524 --> 05:25.718
He's getting away!

05:25.792 --> 05:28.727
I'm gonna have to tuck in behind him here!

05:28.795 --> 05:30.160
Nothing I can do.

05:33.232 --> 05:36.998
He's cocked his leg, his back wheel's
off the ground. (Laughs)

05:38.538 --> 05:40.438
Look at that!
Look at that now - look at him!

05:40.506 --> 05:42.633
He's just roaring away!

05:43.409 --> 05:48.870
He's not only faster, but he's having more fun
because it's just so much nicer to drive.

05:48.948 --> 05:53.044
The whole point of a new car is it's supposed to
be better than the one that went before,

05:53.119 --> 05:55.314
and this plainly isn't! Look.

05:56.055 --> 05:58.387
Ooh, come on, come on, turn in!

06:02.495 --> 06:06.022
Off the track there -
that's just the understeer killing the fun,

06:06.099 --> 06:08.226
killing the power, killing everything.

06:11.104 --> 06:14.437
So, it's slower than its dad
and then there's the spoiler,

06:14.507 --> 06:18.409
which goes right across the middle
of the rear window.

06:18.478 --> 06:21.447
I mean, who thought that was a good idea?

06:22.515 --> 06:24.847
And while we're on the subject
of not very good ideas...

06:26.486 --> 06:28.147
- (Beeping)
- Can you hear that?

06:28.221 --> 06:31.952
That beep is to tell me
the ignition key's still in.

06:32.024 --> 06:36.552
Why? I know the ignition key's in,
cos I've just driven here.

06:36.629 --> 06:38.620
And then there's the um,
then there's the seat.

06:38.698 --> 06:42.828
Instead of having a wheel here,
so you can infinitely adjust the backrest,

06:42.902 --> 06:46.963
you get a ratchet - so you either sit
bolt upright, like you're at work,

06:47.039 --> 06:49.234
or you pull it and then you recline,

06:49.308 --> 06:52.937
like it's a chaise longue
and you're a Victorian prostitute.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.639
Oh, and how's this for a brainwave, OK?

06:54.714 --> 06:57.205
You pull up, you want to get something
from the back seat,

06:57.283 --> 07:01.913
so, you pull that lever, pull the seat forward,
get whatever it is that you wanted,

07:01.988 --> 07:03.387
pop it back,

07:03.456 --> 07:06.789
and it assumes that in the brief moment
you were out of the car,

07:06.859 --> 07:09.327
you've become Richard Hammond.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.955
Why doesn't it go back to where you left it?

07:12.031 --> 07:14.022
I mean, what were they thinking of?

07:16.202 --> 07:19.399
The worst part of this car though,
is the ride comfort.

07:19.472 --> 07:22.168
It's all right here on our smooth track,

07:22.241 --> 07:25.142
but on normal roads it is intolerable.

07:25.211 --> 07:28.612
And it's not just me being a fat old man,
I promise.

07:29.649 --> 07:31.378
Even if you're a teenager,

07:31.451 --> 07:35.945
even if you're used to sleeping on the floor
at parties and being stabbed,

07:36.022 --> 07:38.320
this is completely unacceptable.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.189
You need a skeleton made of granite.

07:43.563 --> 07:48.193
I like hot hatchbacks.
I always have done, but this one...

07:48.267 --> 07:50.758
It's absolutely hopeless.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.969
(Applause)

07:58.878 --> 08:00.175
Out!

08:00.880 --> 08:02.973
You can't hide in there.

08:04.584 --> 08:06.484
Get out. What?

08:06.552 --> 08:08.520
That man,

08:08.588 --> 08:11.318
that man over there told me
while we were watching that film,

08:11.390 --> 08:14.518
- that he's just bought one of these.
- Oh, that is awkward.

08:14.594 --> 08:15.993
- (Laughter)
- Sorry.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.393
How do you feel now?

08:17.463 --> 08:21.229
I took them both out
and I think that one's a much nicer car.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.733
- What, the new one?
- The new one.

08:22.802 --> 08:25.999
The styling's a lot better,
and also a higher rpm.

08:26.072 --> 08:30.406
That sounds much nicer.
This one sounds like you're just thrashing it.

08:30.476 --> 08:32.239
What if you're completely wrong?

08:32.311 --> 08:34.279
(Laughter)

08:34.347 --> 08:36.837
Which, because it's a different opinion
to mine, you are.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.110
- (Laughter)
- The thing is,

08:38.183 --> 08:42.712
what we're talking about here is like a bad
sequel, isn't it? Because this is Die Hard 1,

08:42.788 --> 08:45.586
- and then that's Die Hard 2.
- That is exactly right.

08:45.658 --> 08:49.321
What I was hoping for here was Godfather 2

08:49.395 --> 08:53.263
- and what it is, is Police Academy 7.
- (Laughter)

08:53.332 --> 08:56.392
That's Emmanuelle In Bangkok which...

08:56.469 --> 09:01.771
- (Laughter)
...wasn't as good...

09:01.841 --> 09:03.832
Really?
I wouldn't know about that.

09:03.910 --> 09:07.437
All I do know is this is 18,000 quid,
there or thereabouts.

09:07.513 --> 09:13.315
You can buy a good tidy one of the old ones
for about ten, and that's what I'd do.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.822
And it's a Honda, so it'll be as reliable
as the universe, it'll go on forever.

09:16.889 --> 09:20.256
Absolutely.
And we must now find out how fast it goes,

09:20.326 --> 09:22.487
this one rather, goes round our track,

09:22.562 --> 09:26.589
and that of course means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

09:26.666 --> 09:30.500
Some say that he thought Star Wars
was a documentary...

09:30.570 --> 09:32.060
(Laughter)

09:32.138 --> 09:37.474
...and that he recently pulled out of I'm A
Celebrity because he's frightened of trees...

09:37.543 --> 09:40.273
- (Laughter)
...and Australia...

09:40.346 --> 09:42.906
- (Laughter)
...and Koo Stark.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.381
(Laughter)

09:44.450 --> 09:47.385
And Ant... and Dec.

09:47.453 --> 09:48.579
(Laughter)

09:48.654 --> 09:50.747
All we know is, he's called The Stig.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.955
And away he goes.

09:54.026 --> 09:57.962
Not a particularly fast start, but then frankly,
this really isn't a very fast car.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.328
Talk among yourselves now.

10:00.399 --> 10:03.891
There he is finally at the first corner.
Lots of tire squeal as he goes through.

10:03.970 --> 10:07.098
The understeer seems to be
just about under control so far.

10:07.173 --> 10:10.540
(Man)... ask the prospect if he can
envision himself in the future

10:10.610 --> 10:12.703
with this product, service or opportunity.

10:12.778 --> 10:17.306
(Jeremy) 0h, dear, for some terrifying reason,
Stig's learning how to be a killer salesman.

10:17.383 --> 10:20.875
He drags it round Chicago
in a lumpen and joyless way,

10:20.953 --> 10:22.113
and into the Hammerhead.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.746
Turns in.

10:23.823 --> 10:26.621
0h, God, yeah, look, there's the understeer
and lots of it.

10:26.692 --> 10:31.254
If Stig could experience human emotions,
he'd be feeling mild disappointment now.

10:31.330 --> 10:34.788
(Man) Also remember
that every dog has its day.

10:34.867 --> 10:38.166
Success will prevail. You're in the zone.

10:38.237 --> 10:42.264
(Jeremy) Yes, he is, he's in the VTEC zone
and let's see if it can give him some speed.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.901
Through the Follow-through.
0oh, there we go, not bad.

10:44.977 --> 10:48.970
Difficult second movie now coming into the
difficult second to last corner. That's 0K.

10:49.048 --> 10:53.348
Up to Gambon. Turns in, keeps it straight
and tight and across the line.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.944
- (Applause)
- Yeah, got the time here.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.715
You're gonna be pleased by this.

11:00.793 --> 11:02.317
You're gonna be pleased...

11:03.329 --> 11:07.197
...because it did it
in one minute 16 point...

11:07.266 --> 11:09.029
- No, I'm lying.
- (Laughter)

11:09.101 --> 11:12.628
It actually did it in 1.33.5,

11:12.705 --> 11:15.503
so, it's a little bit faster than a Golf GTI
but a lot worse.

11:15.574 --> 11:17.303
- (Laughter)
- The styling's better.

11:17.376 --> 11:18.968
- Shut up!
- (Laughter)

11:20.513 --> 11:22.242
And now, the news,

11:22.314 --> 11:24.748
and I'm afraid it's very bad.

11:24.817 --> 11:27.012
Jeremy Clarkson has a cold.

11:27.086 --> 11:29.919
I have not got a cold.
I've got bird flu.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.547
(Laughter)

11:31.624 --> 11:35.958
I have. I'm living, breathing proof,
soon to not be living or breathing,

11:36.028 --> 11:38.155
that it can jump species.

11:38.230 --> 11:41.529
Wow, that means it's only one species away
from humans,

11:41.600 --> 11:43.898
- so we could all get it.
- (Laughter)

11:43.969 --> 11:47.234
On with the news. The government
has a new solution for cutting congestion,

11:47.306 --> 11:50.969
which is to ban us all from driving...
to work.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.977
Good, I can't drive, I've got bird flu.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.535
(Laughter)

11:54.613 --> 11:58.674
They're going to introduce,
for speeding, you get six points,

11:58.751 --> 12:00.946
which means two strikes and you're out.

12:01.020 --> 12:03.853
On the plus side, they are talking about
introducing that scheme

12:03.923 --> 12:06.983
where you get two points
if you're only just over the limit.

12:07.059 --> 12:10.119
No, no, no, they're scrapping that,
I read this week,

12:10.196 --> 12:15.099
cos it goes against their policy of all speed
of any sort kills, which actually isn't true.

12:15.167 --> 12:18.830
I read a survey this week, which I've got here.
I brought it out with me.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.873
OK, on country roads,
rural normal roads out of a city,

12:21.941 --> 12:27.140
guess how many injury and, you know,
death accidents are put down to speed?

12:27.213 --> 12:30.205
I dunno, rural, probably 50%, 60%.

12:30.282 --> 12:33.513
- No, yokels. 80%.
- Four.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.680
- 40%.
- 4%.

12:36.756 --> 12:42.717
96% of accidents on rural roads have got
nothing to do with speed, so what is it then?

12:42.795 --> 12:45.992
- What causes the other 96% of accidents?
- Yeah.

12:46.065 --> 12:48.693
Because it's dark and it smells funny
in the countryside.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.464
- (Laughter)
- Does anyone have any ideas?

12:51.537 --> 12:53.471
- What?
- (Man) Tractors.

12:53.539 --> 12:55.439
Horses.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.068
No, I think the man with horses
is onto something.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.702
I genuinely believe it's animals.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.010
People swerving.
You know, they've got their kids in the back,

13:03.082 --> 13:07.314
and swerve on the wrong side of the road
just to miss some fox, which is just a rat.

13:07.386 --> 13:09.183
(Laughter)

13:09.255 --> 13:10.449
- No, it isn't.
- It is.

13:10.523 --> 13:14.186
No, a rat is quite small
and has like a really bald long tail,

13:14.260 --> 13:19.220
and a fox is quite big and fluffy
and has a big bushy tail, and a name - Basil.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.960
- (Laughter)
- You're not a country man, are you?

13:22.034 --> 13:24.901
- Not all of them are called Basil.
- No, no, it's like badgers,

13:24.970 --> 13:28.736
cos have you seen...
I bet you tune in, I do.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.935
- Kate Humble's Badger Watch.
- Every week.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.739
It's not what you'd think at all.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.404
(Laughter)

13:36.015 --> 13:39.416
I tuned in, she was talking about
some stupid little animal

13:39.485 --> 13:41.453
that basically
is a chemical weapons factory

13:41.520 --> 13:43.681
spreading tuberculosis
around the countryside.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.224
- (Laughter)
- People get it into their heads like you

13:46.292 --> 13:48.726
that foxes are cute and badgers are cute,
and they're not.

13:48.794 --> 13:51.354
I honestly believe, genuinely, that the country,

13:51.430 --> 13:56.527
cos we've established
only 4% of accidents are caused by speed,

13:56.602 --> 14:00.368
and I bet most of those are bikers, so
driving in the countryside is completely safe

14:00.439 --> 14:03.306
and would be better
if you could get rid of all the animals.

14:03.375 --> 14:06.776
You've got that the wrong way round.
You know Richmond Park outside London -

14:06.846 --> 14:10.282
everybody drives through there
at 15 or 20 mph,

14:10.349 --> 14:14.308
because they're scared about
running over Bambi, cos it's full of deer.

14:14.386 --> 14:17.480
Then, as soon as they get to the city,
where they'll only run over people,

14:17.556 --> 14:20.354
- they all speed up and drive like lunatics.
- (Laughter)

14:20.426 --> 14:21.620
So, what are you suggesting?

14:21.694 --> 14:24.128
Put the deer in the town.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.426
(Laughter)

14:26.498 --> 14:28.193
Yeah, but actually...

14:28.267 --> 14:31.634
If you empty the countryside of all the animals
and put them in...

14:32.938 --> 14:35.372
James,
you've hit, for the first time in your life...

14:35.441 --> 14:38.706
When I come to power,
I'm gonna make you my minister of transport,

14:38.777 --> 14:42.235
- and you can implement that.
- Oh, there's a rosy future for us all!

14:42.314 --> 14:43.611
(Laughter)

14:43.682 --> 14:45.707
Now, I'd like to talk about a car.

14:45.784 --> 14:47.046
Ooh!

14:47.119 --> 14:48.643
On Top Gear? No!

14:48.721 --> 14:52.452
Seriously, look at this, this is
the Mercedes McLaren SLR Roadster,

14:52.524 --> 14:56.824
which is now officially
the fastest convertible in the world.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.626
That'll do 206 mph,

14:59.698 --> 15:00.960
with the roof down.

15:01.033 --> 15:06.266
But, if a bluebottle flies over the top
of the windscreen at that speed,

15:06.338 --> 15:09.102
and hits you
in the middle of your forehead,

15:09.174 --> 15:10.937
it'll go straight through...

15:11.977 --> 15:13.740
...its own arse.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.439
(Laughter)

15:15.514 --> 15:18.540
- I thought you'd say it'll go through your head.
- I was expecting that.

15:18.617 --> 15:20.107
No, your head'll be fine.

15:20.185 --> 15:24.417
Anyway, you know those Citroëns
that have got a vibrating seat?

15:24.490 --> 15:27.687
And the idea is that if you nod off
and stray out of lane on the motorway,

15:27.760 --> 15:31.218
the seat base vibrates and wakes you up
and ooh, you can get back in lane.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.663
I was talking to a girl the other day
who got one,

15:33.732 --> 15:36.030
and she said she'd gone
from London to Birmingham,

15:36.101 --> 15:38.501
deliberately on the hard shoulder
because it was so nice.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.037
(Laughter)

15:40.105 --> 15:41.504
The only problem with that is,

15:41.573 --> 15:45.532
is that in order to have this excellent facility,
you have to buy a Citroën...

15:45.611 --> 15:50.776
- Which is terrible.
- But now... I've come across this.

15:50.849 --> 15:53.249
- What is it?
- Well, it's a seat base

15:53.319 --> 15:55.253
that you put on your car seat, like that,

15:55.321 --> 15:58.779
and then you turn it on
and the middle bit vibrates.

15:58.857 --> 16:00.586
You sit on it and it vibrates.

16:00.659 --> 16:03.628
- You don't have to go over the lanes?
- You don't need a Citroën either,

16:03.696 --> 16:06.688
you just have this.
The thing is, it's quite annoying.

16:06.765 --> 16:08.790
I think it's probably not meant for you.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.630
(Laughter)

16:10.703 --> 16:11.897
Is it meant for you?

16:11.971 --> 16:15.202
- No, I think you have to be a girl.
- Oh, yeah.

16:15.274 --> 16:18.300
- They're like chaps but they've got...
- Want to come and try this out?

16:18.377 --> 16:19.674
She's blushing.

16:19.745 --> 16:21.440
Come on, try it out.

16:21.513 --> 16:25.779
Try out my captain's chair and tell me
if that's good and you'd like that in your car.

16:26.885 --> 16:29.080
- Are you ready?
- OK.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.985
- Oh, that's good.
- (Laughter)

16:36.028 --> 16:37.518
Does anybody else want a go?

16:38.897 --> 16:40.762
How can this be legal?

16:40.833 --> 16:44.394
Honestly, you can't drive while eating an apple
or using a mobile phone.

16:44.470 --> 16:47.098
But you can drive
when you're all cross-eyed and sweaty!

16:47.172 --> 16:48.366
(Laughter)

16:49.641 --> 16:54.044
- That's 59.99.
- So, it's more expensive than a Citroën.

16:54.113 --> 16:56.274
- (Laughter)
- But it's worth it.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.872
Do you like the Dodge Viper?

16:57.950 --> 16:59.349
- Yeah.
- You do?

16:59.418 --> 17:02.649
Well, there's a new version out - here it is.
It's called the ACR,

17:02.721 --> 17:05.189
and they've squeezed more power
out of the engine,

17:05.257 --> 17:08.589
the 8.4 liter V10 -
has 600 brake horsepower.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.527
And you can buy what they're calling
the hardcore pack.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.997
- Really?
- They'll strip out all the interior -

17:14.066 --> 17:19.367
carpets, radio, and that saves 40 pounds,
which in America is lunch, isn't it?

17:19.438 --> 17:22.669
- (Laughter)
- Anyway, can I make an important point?

17:22.741 --> 17:24.299
- Yes.
- You know petrol

17:24.376 --> 17:26.435
went past a pound a liter this week,

17:26.512 --> 17:30.539
and everybody's saying, "It's too expensive,
we've all got to commit suicide?"

17:30.616 --> 17:34.177
But it isn't expensive at all.
It's cheap.

17:34.253 --> 17:38.713
Well, it is, actually, because some
mineral water I saw was L4.99 a liter.

17:38.791 --> 17:42.192
Exactly. And it's a good job
your car doesn't run on bull semen.

17:42.261 --> 17:43.626
Well, it is, yes, but why?

17:43.695 --> 17:45.526
Because do you know
how much bull semen is?

17:45.597 --> 17:48.259
D'you know, I can't remember
off the top of my head.

17:48.333 --> 17:51.996
- (Laughter)
- L24,000 a liter.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.335
- No way!
- This is my point.

17:54.406 --> 17:58.137
Seriously, I mean, petrol, they've gotta
build an oil rig, float it out to sea,

17:58.210 --> 18:00.644
dig a hole with nothing in it,
dig another, then another,

18:00.712 --> 18:02.407
then you get oil then you put it a ship,

18:02.481 --> 18:04.711
float it halfway round the world
to another country,

18:04.783 --> 18:07.377
put it in a refinery,
which is the size of a small county,

18:07.453 --> 18:10.547
turn it into petrol, ship it to a garage,
put it in a flame-proof tank

18:10.622 --> 18:15.423
and sell it to the customer, and they're doing
that for a pound a liter - I find that incredible.

18:15.494 --> 18:18.759
Actually, no. No, because
the government takes 65 pence,

18:18.831 --> 18:21.322
so, they're actually doing that
for 35 pence a liter.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.062
- Exactly.
- And if you buy ten liters, you get a torch.

18:24.136 --> 18:25.569
- Well, there you go.
- (Laughter)

18:25.637 --> 18:29.937
Oh, no, that said, I filled my car up with petrol
a couple of months ago,

18:30.008 --> 18:31.999
- d'you know how much that cost?
- Well, no.

18:32.077 --> 18:35.843
- Ninety quid.
- No, L35,000.

18:35.914 --> 18:39.042
- You filled it up with bull sperm, you idiot!
- (Laughter)

18:39.118 --> 18:42.781
No, somebody nicked my...
The garage did that credit card thing

18:42.855 --> 18:44.447
- where they sell it to somebody.
- Oh.

18:44.523 --> 18:48.050
Somebody's been running around in California
spending my money on stuff.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.822
I reckon he spent it on bull sperm.

18:49.895 --> 18:53.160
- (Laughter)
- Did you not notice the pump was different?

18:53.232 --> 18:54.893
(Laughter)

18:54.967 --> 18:57.595
Moo! It keeps mooving!

18:59.838 --> 19:04.241
Now it's chasing me!
I don't want it any more.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.001
I've got bird flu, be nice.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.273
(Laughter)

19:08.347 --> 19:15.651
Now, Alfa Romeo has launched a replacement
for its 156 which is called the 159.

19:15.721 --> 19:18.815
Actually, James,
that was launched two years ago.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.155
Yes, it was,
but we weren't paying attention.

19:21.226 --> 19:23.717
- (Laughter)
- Never mind, we like Alfas on Top Gear,

19:23.795 --> 19:28.562
so, I thought that, belatedly, I admit,
I should go and find out what's what.

19:33.305 --> 19:36.103
So, better late than never, here it is.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.770
But before we get stuck in, we have
to take care of some housekeeping.

19:41.046 --> 19:45.881
I have here, the Top Gear Italian Car
Road Test Cliché Swear Box,

19:45.951 --> 19:49.409
and every time I use a word
like "soul" or "passion",

19:49.488 --> 19:55.324
or any bit of fake Italiano to describe this car,
I've gotta put a pound in it.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.755
Let me explain the problem.

20:00.832 --> 20:04.199
For years, people who do my job,
people who test cars,

20:04.269 --> 20:08.069
have only ever been able to say
exactly the same thing about Alfa Romeos,

20:08.140 --> 20:12.201
and it is "Yes, the build quality
is a bit ropey in places,

20:12.277 --> 20:14.871
"and the electrics will probably prove
to be a bit iffy..."

20:16.548 --> 20:18.015
"But we prefer them to BMWs,

20:18.083 --> 20:21.348
"because an Alfa's beautiful looks
and gorgeous engine note...

20:22.955 --> 20:24.923
"...fill it with soul and passion."

20:24.990 --> 20:30.394
Oh, God! Anyway, you see the problem.
This is what Alfa Romeo is about.

20:30.462 --> 20:34.865
To be honest, I could take the road test
on the 156, which we did nine years ago,

20:34.933 --> 20:37.458
and just change the six to a nine.

20:38.503 --> 20:41.631
Still, you never know,
maybe this time things will be different.

20:45.611 --> 20:47.841
Let's start with the looks.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.814
That front end, those lights,

20:50.882 --> 20:53.783
that sweeping bonnet line,
the striking grille,

20:53.852 --> 20:56.047
and it's the same story round the back.

20:58.357 --> 21:02.316
Inside, there are lots of silvery bits
and lovely dials.

21:03.362 --> 21:09.028
In fact, there are two words that perfectly
encapsulate the stylistic beauty of this car.

21:15.340 --> 21:18.400
So, business as usual
when it comes to appearances,

21:18.477 --> 21:22.106
but that could be the last time
I put my hand in my pocket.

21:23.615 --> 21:27.915
You see, Alfa Romeo has now put ein German
in charge of the company,

21:27.986 --> 21:32.286
and he's a man who used to be responsible
for things like BMW M series cars,

21:32.357 --> 21:34.689
and more recently,
the Rolls-Royce Phantom.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.024
Stuff that doesn't fall apart.

21:39.197 --> 21:41.961
Apparently,
he's passionate about build quality,

21:42.034 --> 21:46.630
and he's promising that the electrics will
no longer be installed by a toddler group.

21:46.705 --> 21:51.267
And he better be right, frankly, because this
thing is now stuffed with electrical gizmos.

21:51.343 --> 21:55.211
It's got an electronic key,
it's got automatic climate control,

21:55.280 --> 21:57.271
it's got an mp3 compatible stereo,

21:57.349 --> 21:59.180
it's got parking sensors,

21:59.251 --> 22:02.482
you can have satnav and you can have
an integrated mobile phone.

22:02.554 --> 22:10.586
All this on a car which, at L22,500, is two grand
less than the equivalent 3-series.

22:12.764 --> 22:15.699
Now, we won't know
if this quality regime works

22:15.767 --> 22:19.100
until you tell us what the 159 is like
to live with,

22:19.171 --> 22:21.639
but for now,
there's a more pressing issue.

22:23.008 --> 22:25.738
The danger is that under this new regime,

22:25.811 --> 22:29.542
the alternator will work, the headlights
will come on when you turn the switch,

22:29.614 --> 22:34.142
but the 159 will have lost
its essentially Alfa you-know-what,

22:34.219 --> 22:39.919
and it won't drive with all the Alfa
traditional... diddly and doodah.

22:41.593 --> 22:44.926
To find out,
we need to take it for a good drive.

22:44.996 --> 22:47.521
And for that,
we've come to the River Humber.

22:47.599 --> 22:50.227
It's an amazing feat of nature,

22:50.302 --> 22:54.602
which every day,
drains one fifth of England.

22:56.108 --> 22:59.441
My job today
is to get from one side to the other,

22:59.511 --> 23:03.277
and to keep the Alfa on its toes,
I'll be racing against a man.

23:05.517 --> 23:08.953
Yes, it's another
of our real life situation tests.

23:09.020 --> 23:14.549
This is Graham Bowness. He's rather tall
and on this occasion, that's a good thing.

23:17.763 --> 23:21.494
You see, the easiest and quickest way
across the mile-wide river,

23:21.566 --> 23:24.126
is the magnificent Humber Bridge...

23:25.971 --> 23:29.338
...but in our race,
neither of us is allowed to use it.

23:30.742 --> 23:33.404
So, I'm gonna drive round the estuary
the long way,

23:33.478 --> 23:36.038
starting here, go up here, bit of motorway,

23:36.114 --> 23:39.140
and then this series
of spaghetti-like B roads,

23:39.217 --> 23:44.280
where I'll find out if the Alfa still has
the soul and the passion.

23:46.358 --> 23:49.816
And Graham? He's going to do
something rather amazing.

23:49.895 --> 23:51.954
He's going to walk across.

23:52.030 --> 23:54.123
Is there a risk that you'll just get stuck?

23:54.199 --> 23:58.966
There is, yeah. There's a risk that when
I'm in the thick mud that's across there,

23:59.037 --> 24:03.736
exhaustion can maybe get the better of me
and then I'll just, you know, pass out.

24:03.809 --> 24:07.745
So, you haven't got a breathing tube
or a small aqualung or anything like that?

24:07.813 --> 24:10.680
You can only breathe as long as your head
is above the water,

24:10.749 --> 24:13.650
- and it will only just be above the water.
- Yeah.

24:13.718 --> 24:16.881
- So you've either gotta make it or you drown?
- Correct.

24:18.557 --> 24:21.958
What else can I say
but three, two, one...

24:22.027 --> 24:23.255
Go.

24:33.171 --> 24:37.164
Right, I'm not gonna be beaten by a man in
a giant condom walking across a muddy river.

24:39.611 --> 24:44.275
Graham's journey of 1.8 miles
should take him about an hour and a half,

24:44.349 --> 24:49.048
and my journey of 65 miles,
should take me about the same.

24:51.823 --> 24:55.418
I'll just tell you quickly about the new engine
in this car while I'm in the village.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.463
It's a 2.2 liter petrol four-cylinder,
it's very modern.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.896
It's got words like "variable"
written on the top of it.

25:06.171 --> 25:10.005
There's a lovely bit in this engine as you get
into the higher reaches of the rev range.

25:10.075 --> 25:12.703
It really comes alive.

25:13.778 --> 25:16.440
That's a quid in the box whatever that is.

25:22.687 --> 25:26.953
As thousands of tonnes of tidal water
tore away at Graham's muscles,

25:27.025 --> 25:29.960
I left the B roads
for a quick motorway blast.

25:34.499 --> 25:35.932
Here we go.

25:37.602 --> 25:39.467
Get into fifth.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.396
The great thing about an Alfa is,

25:42.474 --> 25:46.274
somehow the Italians do know
how to make a car feel elemental.

25:46.344 --> 25:49.836
But I suppose that's not surprising
from a nation that gave us Verdi.

25:59.124 --> 26:01.354
It was time to leave the motorway.

26:01.426 --> 26:04.691
Ahead lay 35 more miles of B road.

26:04.763 --> 26:06.355
Now it gets interesting.

26:11.102 --> 26:13.434
Graham was past the halfway point,

26:13.505 --> 26:15.405
and despite his immense strength,

26:15.473 --> 26:19.671
he was struggling against
the incoming 12 mph tide.

26:23.481 --> 26:25.881
I was also struggling
to keep hold of my money.

26:28.219 --> 26:31.882
I'm just stringing this series
of sweeping bends together,

26:31.957 --> 26:36.257
like someone who's really skilled
at using a fork to roll up their spaghett...

26:43.301 --> 26:45.428
Nice tight right-hander coming up here.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.203
It's got a little kick
and a shimmy from the front.

26:50.275 --> 26:53.676
It's all frisky like one of those Peio ponies.

26:54.980 --> 26:56.208
This is getting expensive.

27:02.520 --> 27:06.718
The Alfa's handling had cost me dear -
four quid, in fact...

27:08.526 --> 27:11.256
...but now we were in the final stages
of the race.

27:14.733 --> 27:15.757
Come on!

27:32.217 --> 27:34.048
This is it, this is the home stretch bit.

27:37.722 --> 27:39.815
Come on.

27:47.866 --> 27:51.461
I'm looking for the waterside beacon.

27:56.941 --> 27:59.034
There it is.
That's the beacon.

28:07.786 --> 28:09.083
Oh, for Pete's sake!

28:11.122 --> 28:13.386
I'd lost and I was broke.

28:13.458 --> 28:14.925
Congratulations anyway.

28:14.993 --> 28:17.860
- Thank you.
- Do you mind if I don't?

28:17.929 --> 28:19.954
(Applause)

28:21.399 --> 28:25.893
Now, not so long ago,
we in Britain bought more estate cars

28:25.970 --> 28:29.030
than any other nation on earth,
but then all of a sudden,

28:29.107 --> 28:33.476
everybody decided that what they
really wanted was a big 4x4 of some sort.

28:33.545 --> 28:37.709
The problem is, though, that these days,
if you drive a big 4x4 into a city,

28:37.782 --> 28:42.378
communists and ecologicals throw eggs
at you and make rude gestures.

28:42.454 --> 28:47.221
Obviously, one solution is to buy
a 1963 Opel Kadett, preferably yellow.

28:47.292 --> 28:50.750
- I called mine...
- No, Richard, that's not a solution,

28:50.829 --> 28:52.262
but I think I've got one.

28:52.330 --> 28:56.596
What's the matter
with going back to the estate car?

29:00.071 --> 29:03.973
For the same sort of money as
a Porsche Cayenne or a Range Rover,

29:04.042 --> 29:06.135
you could have either of these.

29:06.211 --> 29:10.113
There's the BMWM5 Touring...

29:13.785 --> 29:17.949
...or the AMG Mercedes E Class.

29:21.459 --> 29:24.155
Both will take five people in comfort,

29:24.229 --> 29:28.666
in the same way that a Range Rover
will take five people in comfort.

29:28.733 --> 29:32.464
And it's not like you're wanting for space
in the boot either.

29:32.537 --> 29:34.596
In here, with the back seats folded down,

29:34.672 --> 29:40.338
I have been able to fit
a massive 60 cubic feet of cheese,

29:40.411 --> 29:45.542
so if you're in the cheese-making industry,
this is a very practical and impressive car.

29:47.252 --> 29:51.882
Now, because the Mercedes is lower,
obviously you get less space in the back,

29:51.956 --> 29:53.685
but you'd be surprised how close it is.

29:53.758 --> 29:56.886
I've actually got
57 cubic feet of cheese in there.

29:56.961 --> 30:03.594
And if you convert cheese into dogs,
that's 4.3 Great Danes.

30:03.668 --> 30:06.796
And what's more,
if I push this button here,

30:06.871 --> 30:11.740
the whole floor slides out,
so, if this cheddar were a dog,

30:11.810 --> 30:15.473
it would be able to get in and out
more easily.

30:17.148 --> 30:23.087
Sadly, the BMW isn't quite as commodious,
and the rear seats don't fold down flat,

30:23.154 --> 30:26.123
but it's still not what you'd call poky in there.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.388
So, if it's space you're worried about,

30:31.462 --> 30:35.990
these cars are very nearly as good
as the four-wheel drive alternatives.

30:41.606 --> 30:43.870
They're also just children-proof.

30:43.942 --> 30:47.469
I mean, yes, obviously there's a lot of leather
and carpet back there,

30:47.545 --> 30:49.877
into which kids can rub jam and chocolate,

30:49.948 --> 30:55.284
but then, the back of a Porsche Cayenne
isn't exactly a Fisher-Price ball pit, is it?

30:57.989 --> 31:00.719
So, what about the environment?

31:02.327 --> 31:04.921
Well, this is the Ape and Apple pub.

31:04.996 --> 31:07.863
It's where the Manchester branch
of Greenpeace meets

31:07.932 --> 31:13.302
to discuss polar bears and algae
over a lovely pint of wheatgrass.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.532
Now, the fact of the matter is,

31:15.607 --> 31:18.804
those cars produce about the same amount
of greenhouse gases

31:18.877 --> 31:20.538
as a Porsche Cayenne Turbo,

31:20.612 --> 31:24.605
but, because ecohippies
are so hung up on off-road cars,

31:24.682 --> 31:28.448
nobody's really paying them
any attention at all.

31:28.519 --> 31:31.977
In a whole hour, not one person
pulled off their windscreen wipers

31:32.056 --> 31:33.887
or let down their tires.

31:36.227 --> 31:38.195
And there's more good news.

31:38.263 --> 31:40.959
These cars are more comfortable
than any 4x4.

31:41.032 --> 31:47.062
Yes, sure, the BMW crashes about a bit,
but the ride in the Merc is sublime.

31:47.138 --> 31:53.202
And so is its onboard entertainment, navigation
command system thing.

31:53.278 --> 31:55.178
The BMW's is far too complicated

31:55.246 --> 31:59.546
but even I can get this one to work
without hitting it with a hammer.

31:59.617 --> 32:02.518
- Your route is being calculated.
- There you go. Easy-peasy.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.953
Please turn right. Now turn right.

32:05.023 --> 32:09.153
And to shut her up,
we just push that and she's silenced.

32:10.194 --> 32:13.527
Please turn right in 100 yards.

32:29.380 --> 32:33.578
0f course, where both cars fall down
is out here.

32:35.153 --> 32:39.613
Neither could pull a horsebox
up a slippery field, for instance.

32:39.691 --> 32:44.060
I know this because neither can even
pull themselves up a slippery field.

32:45.129 --> 32:52.797
So, if you... If you get stuck in a field,
these cars are not ideal.

32:52.870 --> 32:58.365
But what if you were to get stuck say,
on the tarmac at Manchester Airport,

32:58.443 --> 33:01.207
when it was deserted
because of a fire drill?

33:38.750 --> 33:40.377
(Squealing tires)

33:44.822 --> 33:47.814
Why does anybody buy
a Range Rover Sport?

33:47.892 --> 33:52.886
If you want sport, get an M5,
turn the traction control on,

33:52.964 --> 33:56.957
and mash your foot into the Axminster.

33:57.035 --> 33:58.502
(Tires squeal)

34:10.715 --> 34:15.277
Like the normal M5, it's got
a 500 brake horsepower V10 engine.

34:18.389 --> 34:22.882
It's got a seven-speed flappy paddle gearbox
with shift ferocity control.

34:25.429 --> 34:27.591
It's got an electronic differential.

34:29.100 --> 34:32.069
It is one of the most exciting cars
made today.

34:32.136 --> 34:36.572
0nly now, because this is an estate,
your dog can come too.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.943
OK, that's 100 mph.
Just watch these numbers come.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.443
Remember, it's limited to 155.

34:49.520 --> 34:52.784
That's 140. Here we go, that's a 150.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.083
160?

34:57.295 --> 34:59.786
I'm looking through a head-up display.

34:59.864 --> 35:03.800
We're moving to now, 175 mph.

35:03.868 --> 35:09.204
On a runway, you really do think
"I'm gonna take off!"

35:22.487 --> 35:25.012
The bigger, softer, more practical Mercedes

35:25.089 --> 35:29.651
doesn't look like it could hold a candle
to the BMW, but don't be fooled.

35:31.896 --> 35:39.530
Because its 6.2 liter V8 pumps out
an astonishing 507 brake horsepower.

35:46.410 --> 35:50.005
This thing is more powerful
than a Ferrari F40.

35:51.449 --> 35:53.474
It's more powerful than Mexico.

35:58.156 --> 36:03.617
The extraordinary thing about the Merc
is it doesn't have an electronic diff,

36:03.694 --> 36:05.525
it doesn't have variable anything.

36:05.596 --> 36:08.121
You just wanna get in and go.

36:09.934 --> 36:11.367
And then go some more.

36:12.970 --> 36:14.301
And more.

36:18.276 --> 36:19.265
(Laughs)

36:27.852 --> 36:29.683
So, which is quicker?

36:29.754 --> 36:31.654
Tell you what,

36:31.722 --> 36:33.713
let's find out.

36:33.791 --> 36:35.088
(Tires squeal)

36:41.732 --> 36:44.200
I think that the BMW brakes better than this.

36:47.238 --> 36:51.402
I think it handles better than this,
I think it's quicker through the corners...

36:52.443 --> 36:55.571
but as soon as you get this thing
on a straight...

36:58.716 --> 37:03.085
...the BMW doesn't stand a chance!

37:12.463 --> 37:15.227
These cars then, they're both brilliant.

37:15.299 --> 37:17.961
Sure, they can't off-road
like a big 4x4,

37:18.035 --> 37:21.869
but they're so much more fun
where you spend most of your time -

37:21.939 --> 37:26.239
on the runway at Manchester Airport.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.417
(Applause)

37:41.792 --> 37:43.089
Thank you.

37:44.161 --> 37:45.788
- Come on then.
- What?

37:45.863 --> 37:48.058
- Which is best?
- Which is best?

37:48.132 --> 37:53.195
Er, well, the BMW is more fun to drive
and a teeny-weeny bit cheaper,

37:53.271 --> 37:54.932
and I think slightly better-looking,

37:55.006 --> 37:59.340
but, the Merc is bigger, more comfortable,
more practical, faster,

37:59.410 --> 38:03.312
easier to use
and it sounds like amplified thunder.

38:03.381 --> 38:04.541
So, you'd have the Merc.

38:04.615 --> 38:06.742
- No.
- Why not?

38:06.817 --> 38:09.684
- Because I'd have a Range Rover.
- What?! Why?

38:09.754 --> 38:11.915
- (Laughter)
- Because when you drive a Range Rover,

38:11.989 --> 38:14.355
you get this warm, moist feeling inside

38:14.425 --> 38:17.417
- that you're annoying Bill Oddie.
- (Laughter)

38:18.362 --> 38:21.763
Now, here on Top Gear we're always
on the lookout for new forms of motor sport,

38:21.832 --> 38:25.461
and this week, we think
we've come up with a good one.

38:29.740 --> 38:33.107
Traditionally, amateur racers
go off for a weekend of motor sport,

38:33.177 --> 38:37.113
with a motorhome to sleep in
and the car on the trailer behind.

38:39.750 --> 38:43.186
But I've thought of a cunning way
to streamline this whole business.

38:43.254 --> 38:46.849
Just leave the car and trailer behind
and race the motorhome.

38:49.593 --> 38:52.562
I think this plan
has a stench of genius about it.

38:52.630 --> 38:55.861
You've still got something to get there in,
something to sleep in,

38:55.933 --> 38:59.198
something to race,
and you've still got something to go home in.

39:04.508 --> 39:09.912
To test this theory, I've come here
to Essex Raceway in Essex.

39:09.980 --> 39:13.347
Home to banger racing, stock-car racing

39:13.417 --> 39:18.150
and from next year, the British round
of the Formula 0ne world championship.

39:19.790 --> 39:24.159
This is my motorhome, a Ford Midas. Nice.

39:24.228 --> 39:29.689
Now, let's meet my fellow competitors and
their mobile motor sport racing living quarters.

39:31.969 --> 39:37.066
In the Mitsubishi L300,
we've got touring car star, Matt Neal.

39:39.310 --> 39:44.111
In the Toyota Liteace
we've got touring car star, Anthony Reid.

39:45.583 --> 39:50.043
In the Chevrolet, we've got touring car star,
Tom Chilton.

39:51.722 --> 39:55.351
In the left hand drive
Fiat Ducato NV70 Globetrotter,

39:55.426 --> 39:58.623
we've got touring car star, Mat Jackson.

39:59.663 --> 40:01.961
And in the Transit,
we've got desperate.

40:05.403 --> 40:09.499
So, we have all sizes and shapes
of luxury motorhome here,

40:09.573 --> 40:13.566
and all manner of engines and power outputs,
and that's good,

40:13.644 --> 40:17.603
because it leads to the one thing
you want most of all in motor sport -

40:17.681 --> 40:19.740
unpredictability.

40:21.385 --> 40:23.945
And the unpredictability doesn't end there,

40:24.021 --> 40:28.890
because motorhome racing brings with it
a whole new set of tactical decisions.

40:30.528 --> 40:36.296
You see, the governing body of motorhome
racing states in the official 2007 rulebook

40:36.367 --> 40:40.861
that you must prepare your motorhome
for racing the night before the race.

40:40.938 --> 40:44.396
Once the sun goes down,
you may not make any further changes.

40:46.710 --> 40:48.644
Which leaves you with a dilemma -

40:48.712 --> 40:51.613
do you strip it out
and endure a terrible night's sleep

40:51.682 --> 40:53.946
that means you're not on form for the race,

40:54.018 --> 40:56.248
or do you leave the luxuries in place,

40:56.320 --> 41:01.121
and then face having to compete
with all the extra weight onboard?

41:03.861 --> 41:07.353
I went for the strip it all out,
have a bad night option...

41:09.633 --> 41:12.397
...and actually,
so did all the other drivers.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.028
Well, nearly all.

41:16.173 --> 41:18.664
Gravy juice, pan, warm.

41:18.742 --> 41:21.040
Peas, carrots, add.

41:26.951 --> 41:28.976
Finally, everything was ready...

41:29.053 --> 41:30.384
That's a pie.

41:30.454 --> 41:32.217
...for next day's big race.

41:36.560 --> 41:38.755
Night descended over Essex.

41:38.829 --> 41:41.093
- (Dog barking)
- (Gunfire)

41:45.135 --> 41:47.126
Morning broke over Essex.

41:47.204 --> 41:49.195
- (Barking)
- (Gunfire)

41:49.273 --> 41:53.039
It was time to celebrate the birth
of a new motor sport.

42:03.521 --> 42:05.682
Great day for a race, this -

42:05.756 --> 42:07.087
Friday the 13th.

42:13.697 --> 42:15.358
(Horn)

42:22.706 --> 42:26.699
As one of the sport's co-founders,
I was in car number one,

42:26.777 --> 42:28.972
and James was in car number six.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.774
Turn it in, feed it through the apex.

42:32.850 --> 42:35.341
There's quite a lot of understeer occurring.

42:35.419 --> 42:37.011
0oh-hool

42:39.957 --> 42:41.390
Now, the point of this sport

42:41.458 --> 42:44.916
is that you should be able to drive
your motorhome home again,

42:44.995 --> 42:48.453
so the rules are simple -
15 laps and no body contact.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.461
Oh!

42:54.471 --> 42:55.733
(Horn)

42:57.975 --> 43:01.274
Mind you,
we had invited touring car drivers.

43:01.345 --> 43:06.112
Right, we're three abreast.
This is gonna be a late braking competition.

43:07.184 --> 43:08.378
Oh, no!

43:08.452 --> 43:09.419
Oh!

43:10.120 --> 43:13.180
I've just seen the door of the kitchen unit
on the track,

43:13.257 --> 43:14.918
and that doesn't happen at Silverstone.

43:15.960 --> 43:19.862
James' tactic of a good night's sleep
wasn't working out.

43:19.930 --> 43:23.366
He was at the back of the field,
but he had a plan.

43:23.434 --> 43:29.168
But the trick, I think,
is to take a slow but inside line,

43:29.239 --> 43:32.675
so that, as they get carried away,
I can sneak through on the left-hand edge.

43:32.743 --> 43:38.010
The little red Toyota had no bulk
and no power but was plucky,

43:38.082 --> 43:40.812
and we respected that... for a bit.

43:46.523 --> 43:47.683
(Laughs)

43:47.758 --> 43:49.953
But with some aerodynamic tweaks...

43:50.794 --> 43:52.819
the Toyota found some speed.

43:54.865 --> 43:56.662
No, the Toyota's gone through!

44:05.542 --> 44:09.945
Lap eight, and amazingly,
James had managed to get lost on an oval.

44:15.953 --> 44:19.650
0n lap ten,
I lost a bit of structural rigidity.

44:22.326 --> 44:23.725
Oh, nuts!

44:25.262 --> 44:27.822
May have been a slight touch there.

44:27.898 --> 44:31.732
Most of this will clean up.
Most of that will clean out.

44:32.836 --> 44:34.303
I'm having a burst of power,

44:34.371 --> 44:37.863
and it's not...
it's coming from me own motor.

44:38.876 --> 44:42.403
With just three laps to go,
the red mist descended.

44:57.828 --> 45:00.422
Luckily, my structure was still holding.

45:04.034 --> 45:05.831
No, it wasn't.

45:05.903 --> 45:07.165
(James) Oh, Hammond's gone!

45:07.237 --> 45:09.068
Lightness is everything.

45:10.741 --> 45:11.901
Whoa!

45:13.410 --> 45:15.674
That shelving unit was my downfall.

45:18.415 --> 45:19.746
Bloody pikeys!

45:22.786 --> 45:24.947
Oh, right on my inside line!

45:27.124 --> 45:30.321
0n the checkered flag,
the little red Toyota was first,

45:30.394 --> 45:32.157
and I came home third.

45:46.076 --> 45:49.307
Well, I think the "no contact" rule
needs a bit of a tweak,

45:49.379 --> 45:50.869
but we are onto something here.

45:52.950 --> 45:56.716
Like I said, you turn up in one vehicle,
you sleep in it,

45:56.787 --> 46:00.223
you race in it and then you drive it home.

46:06.530 --> 46:08.828
(Applause)

46:08.899 --> 46:10.389
Well done.

46:11.802 --> 46:14.669
So... Were you impressed?

46:14.738 --> 46:19.368
Well, not really, because if I'd have been invited
to take part in your new sport,

46:19.443 --> 46:21.843
I would have brought one of these.

46:21.912 --> 46:25.507
It's made in Germany
and it's called The Performance.

46:25.582 --> 46:27.243
- Is it fast?
- No.

46:27.317 --> 46:30.844
It has a 12,000cc engine
with a turbocharger,

46:30.921 --> 46:33.287
but it's quite heavy.

46:33.357 --> 46:34.619
Why, what's in it?

46:34.691 --> 46:35.953
Well, let me show you.

46:36.026 --> 46:37.391
Step this way.

46:37.461 --> 46:39.656
- Do you need a ladder?
- No, I'll be fine.

46:39.730 --> 46:41.493
- OK.
- (Laughter)

46:41.565 --> 46:45.126
These stairs, for example, are granite -
you can see the glitter.

46:45.202 --> 46:46.965
It's all sparkly!
I want that in my house!

46:47.037 --> 46:49.471
Well, there's a lot more
you'll want in your house in here.

46:49.540 --> 46:51.371
- The table's granite.
- I want that.

46:51.441 --> 46:54.410
This work surface here, OK -
you looking at it?

46:54.478 --> 46:56.070
It's sparkly, I want it in my house.

46:56.146 --> 46:58.341
- Check this out.
- Whoa, what's that?

46:58.415 --> 47:02.579
- That's the plasma television coming up.
- I want that in my home!

47:02.653 --> 47:04.484
Come look at the bathroom.

47:04.555 --> 47:07.854
There's a power shower -
I mean, it massages you, OK?

47:07.925 --> 47:10.086
- And then, look at the floor.
- Oh, look at that!

47:10.160 --> 47:13.425
Look at the underfloor lighting
and then look at these taps, OK?

47:13.497 --> 47:17.228
Just touch that... and it comes on.

47:17.301 --> 47:19.633
Ok, and that's blue, so it's cold.

47:19.703 --> 47:22.228
Push that, it goes red when it's hot!

47:22.306 --> 47:24.638
And then, in there, is your bedroom.

47:24.708 --> 47:26.505
Wow!

47:26.577 --> 47:28.602
You see, I don't think that's gonna work,

47:28.679 --> 47:31.512
because as I proved,
if you don't strip all that stuff out,

47:31.582 --> 47:33.516
it'll be too heavy and you'll come last.

47:33.584 --> 47:34.949
No, James, you're wrong,

47:35.018 --> 47:38.317
cos you haven't seen this thing's
piece de résistance yet.

47:38.388 --> 47:43.189
What you have to do is come down here
like this, open this up,

47:43.260 --> 47:45.490
and there you are.

47:45.562 --> 47:46.756
(Richard) Wow!

47:46.830 --> 47:50.231
What I'm gonna do now
is just lower that down.

47:51.268 --> 47:52.633
Check it out.

47:52.703 --> 47:55.035
(Gasps and laughter)

47:55.105 --> 47:56.436
Oh, that is brilliant.

47:56.506 --> 47:58.440
Yeah!

47:58.508 --> 48:00.442
(Applause)

48:02.546 --> 48:03.843
That is...

48:04.414 --> 48:05.745
That is amazing!

48:05.816 --> 48:08.182
So, when this gets all smashed up
in the race,

48:08.252 --> 48:09.776
you can drive home in your posh car.

48:09.853 --> 48:14.950
Exactly. That's what you need, Richard,
to win a motorhome race, is ingenuity.

48:15.025 --> 48:16.253
How much is it?

48:16.326 --> 48:18.226
- Er, and cash.
- How much?

48:18.295 --> 48:22.755
Er, well, excluding the car,
this would cost you...

48:24.601 --> 48:26.762
...L750,000.

48:26.837 --> 48:28.702
- That's a lot.
- It is.

48:28.772 --> 48:30.706
You could almost buy a house for that.

48:30.774 --> 48:32.469
(Laughter)

48:32.542 --> 48:35.033
And on that bombshell, it's time to end.

48:35.112 --> 48:38.275
Thank you very much for watching.
See you next week. Good night.
