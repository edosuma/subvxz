You're gonna

Will not!

about porcupine tag!

I cannot leave you
two alone

get up the flagpole?

00:56.723 --> 00:57.932
I shimmied!

You keep stepping

It's kinda hard not to
when it's such a big target.

01:44.604 --> 01:45.939
I am proportional.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.860
Destiny,
what's taking you so long?

01:51.736 --> 01:53.905
I like my pillows
extra fluffed.

01:55.323 --> 01:57.784
Ladies,
we're going spelunking.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.787
Yay! It's been so long
since I had a spa day.

02:01.287 --> 02:04.999
No, Emma.
Spelunking means
exploring caves.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.877
I would like to
retract my "yay"
and submit a "boo."

02:08.336 --> 02:10.004
I second that boo.

02:10.004 --> 02:13.258
You want us to crawl around
in some cold, filthy caves?

02:13.258 --> 02:16.845
It'll be great! It's spooky,
dark, and there are bats!

02:18.680 --> 02:20.223
Not really
selling it, Lou.

02:21.057 --> 02:23.226
Did I mention
you get to wear
these cool hats?

02:24.352 --> 02:26.271
Hmm. I do love
accessories.

02:28.064 --> 02:30.108
And I love when
there's a spotlight
on me.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.116
Sorry.
Force of habit.

02:41.619 --> 02:43.621
Why do we need
to be in here with you?

02:43.913 --> 02:46.666
Because I cannot be
in multiple places
at once.

02:47.083 --> 02:49.544
I am co-owner of the camp,
I run the kitchen,

02:49.544 --> 02:51.796
and I must keep
you two from doing
something dangerous.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.590
You mean
like that?

02:54.215 --> 02:56.301
Finn!
What are you doing?

02:56.801 --> 02:58.136
Untying my shoe.

02:59.679 --> 03:00.763
Stop that.

The sharpest thing
you are allowed

03:02.891 --> 03:04.642
to go near
is my wit. (CHUCKLES)

03:05.101 --> 03:07.437
That wouldn't
cut through soft butter.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.316
I'm bored!

03:11.649 --> 03:14.777
Well, I am sorry,
but this is the new rule,

03:14.777 --> 03:17.739
when you are not engaged
in supervised camp activities,

03:17.739 --> 03:19.198
you must be
with Papa Grizzly.

03:19.699 --> 03:21.868
Please don't
call yourself Papa Grizzly.

03:22.368 --> 03:23.369
It's disturbing.

03:23.703 --> 03:24.704
Very.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.041
Ooh, I wonder if I can
fit my head in
that toaster.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.959
No, no.
You can't.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.212
And, newer rule,
Papa Grizzly says

03:33.212 --> 03:34.380
go outside and play.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.469
The kitchen is obviously
way too dangerous for them.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.554
(YELLING IN PAIN) Ow, ow, ow!
Still hot!

03:45.725 --> 03:48.144
Okay, now remember,
once we get inside,

03:48.144 --> 03:51.064
there's more twists and turns
than a pig's intestinal tract.

03:51.814 --> 03:54.067
That's the ninth
thing today
she's compared

03:54.067 --> 03:55.443
to a pig's
intestinal tract.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.197
So, before we go in,
some basic safety rules.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.199
Stay close
at all times.

04:01.199 --> 04:04.535
If you do get lost,
stay put and wait
for me to find you.

04:04.535 --> 04:07.205
And watch out
for the three-legged goat,
he's a biter.

04:08.122 --> 04:09.123
What?

04:10.708 --> 04:12.377
Oh, sorry, that was from
my spiel for the petting
zoo back home.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.171
Flashlights on.

Don't be scared
to go into the cave, Prancy.

what she's doing.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.472
LOU: Okay,
watch your step.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.266
Ow!

04:27.350 --> 04:29.811
Careful. Those'll
sneak up on you.

04:30.895 --> 04:33.022
Right. It was cleverly
hiding at eye level.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.234
Ow! My head!

04:37.235 --> 04:38.820
Told you
it was a big target.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.408
And I told you
I'm proportional.

04:48.413 --> 04:49.956
Maybe we should
rethink this.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.963
(NERVOUSLY)
Okay, I'm ready!

04:57.213 --> 04:58.756
One,

04:59.674 --> 05:00.883
two...

05:00.883 --> 05:01.926
Finn!

05:03.303 --> 05:04.762
What are
you doing?

05:05.221 --> 05:07.807
Seeing how good my aim is
without my contact lenses.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.058
What?

05:10.601 --> 05:13.271
Despite my best efforts,
you both keep getting
into trouble.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.816
It is clear to me now
that more drastic measures
are required.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.278
Ah. We can't
handle anymore
"stern talking-to".

05:27.160 --> 05:28.286
EMMA: Wow.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.913
The farther in we go,
the darker it gets.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.458
Yes, Emma,
that's how caves work.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.086
ZURI: Oh, look!
A cave painting!

05:37.962 --> 05:39.464
Cool!

05:39.464 --> 05:41.966
Is that the Kikiwaka
monster that the camp
is named after?

05:42.341 --> 05:45.762
Yep. But the real one
is even more terrifying.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.347
There's a real
Kikiwaka monster?

05:48.347 --> 05:51.350
(CHUCKLES) Nope.
Because that might
scare the campers,

05:51.350 --> 05:53.144
which would be bad
for business.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.733
Wow. The goddess
in that painting
kinda looks familiar.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.069
It should.
It's your mom.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.112
I drew it
because I worship her.

06:03.362 --> 06:05.698
See the minion offering
up the season's harvest?

06:06.783 --> 06:07.867
That's me.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.370
And this cave
just got a whole
lot creepier.

06:19.337 --> 06:20.546
(FAINT SQUEAK)

06:22.298 --> 06:24.133
Please tell me
that was a floorboard.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.469
Emma,
we're in a cave.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.179
And we're
gonna be fine.

(DISTANT SQUEAKING)

06:31.349 --> 06:32.350
Lou?

06:33.893 --> 06:35.978
Okay, girls. Remember,
there's nothing
to be afraid of.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.438
So stay calm,

06:37.438 --> 06:39.941

you do, don't...

there were bats in the caves!

you just meant
we had boogers!

06:51.953 --> 06:52.954

07:01.462 --> 07:03.089
Great field trip, Lou.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.175
Ugh. We're covered
in bat poop!

07:07.176 --> 07:08.886
Quit complaining.

07:08.886 --> 07:12.723
You saw nature, you saw art,
and running in terror
was great cardio.

Prancy!

07:17.019 --> 07:18.354
Destiny?
Are you okay?

07:18.354 --> 07:21.732

as they don't lay eggs...

trust fall!
It'll be fun!

07:38.416 --> 07:40.585
It's not fun,
and I don't trust you.

This is Ghost Ravi.

08:09.947 --> 08:13.451
Or he's watching us

08:14.994 --> 08:17.497
Correct!
With my new
surveillance system,

08:17.497 --> 08:19.874
I can see you
wherever you are.

08:20.416 --> 08:23.044
How many of these
cameras did you
install around camp?

08:23.377 --> 08:24.378
56.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.297
I got a great deal
on a bulk order.

You mean from now on
you're gonna watch us

08:30.092 --> 08:32.470

08:55.868 --> 08:58.788
You just answered my question,
so you can't be sleepwalking.

on our field trip
to the bat toilet.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.076
No. He's my stuffed animal.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.495
And he makes me
feel safe, okay?

09:39.495 --> 09:41.455
I didn't want to tell anyone
'cause I was embarrassed.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.791
Go ahead and laugh.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.423
You shouldn't go
by yourself.
I'll get the gear.

09:52.466 --> 09:55.344
Wow, you're being
so sweet, Zuri.

09:56.178 --> 09:57.513
Don't let it
get out.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.889
It'll ruin
my rep.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.899
Well, Dancy was nowhere
along the trail.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.986
His name is Prancy.

10:12.528 --> 10:15.865
Short for
Sir Prancifald Winston
Hartfield the...

10:15.865 --> 10:16.866
Never mind.

10:18.659 --> 10:19.785
I guess
I must have dropped him

10:19.785 --> 10:21.287
when we ran away
from the bats.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.045
You sure you wanna
go back in there?

10:29.545 --> 10:30.546
I have to.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.549
I know
he's just
a stuffed animal,

10:33.549 --> 10:36.636
but Prancy's been
my best friend
since forever.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.472
I don't expect you
to understand.

10:41.641 --> 10:43.601
Actually,
I understand completely.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.436
You do?

10:45.770 --> 10:46.771
Sure.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.356
When I was your age,

10:48.356 --> 10:50.733
I had an imaginary
best friend,
Millie the Mermaid.

10:51.567 --> 10:54.570
Wait. Your best friend
was an imaginary mermaid?

10:55.279 --> 10:56.614
(CHUCKLES)
That's weird.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.617
You want your horse
back or not?

11:00.242 --> 11:01.285
Let's go.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.415
Where is he?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.379
I stepped on
something.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.214
Ooh, I think
it's Prancy!

11:14.382 --> 11:17.635
A bone? How could you
think that was Prancy?

11:17.635 --> 11:19.553
I don't know,
I never met the guy.

11:20.596 --> 11:21.639
Or this guy.

11:23.724 --> 11:25.684
We're never
gonna find him.

11:25.684 --> 11:29.772
Well, maybe we could
find you a new best friend
in the Lost and Found.

11:29.980 --> 11:32.525
There's a one-eyed bear
who's been there
since the 90s.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.778
No. I am not leaving
without Prancy.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.118
Prancy!

11:42.701 --> 11:44.203
I missed you
so much!

11:44.203 --> 11:47.748
You must have been
so cold and scared
out here all alone.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.251
I'm so glad
you found him.

11:50.626 --> 11:51.836
Now let's
get out here.

11:54.380 --> 11:57.091
Um. How do
we get out of here?

11:57.508 --> 11:59.468
Easy. Just go back
the way we came.

12:00.094 --> 12:01.137
Which was?

12:06.559 --> 12:07.810
It all
looks the same.

12:08.727 --> 12:10.604
We're never gonna
find our way out.

12:11.188 --> 12:12.398
Don't worry.

12:12.815 --> 12:16.402
That wall has a sticky-out
rock thing, and that wall...

12:18.279 --> 12:19.530
(PANICKING) It all
looks the same!

12:25.995 --> 12:28.330
(CHICKEN CLUCKING
ALARM TUNE PLAYING)

12:29.707 --> 12:32.501
Ugh. I hate
that clucking clock.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.924
Wait a minute,
where's Zuri?
And Destiny?

12:40.759 --> 12:41.927
They're not
in the bathroom.

12:42.386 --> 12:44.180
Maybe they got up early
to help Ravi
in the kitchen?

12:44.680 --> 12:46.432
We're talking about Zuri
and Destiny here.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.642
They wouldn't get
up early if the cabin
was on fire.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.520
Good thing they weren't
here when the cabin
was on fire.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.814
What could
they be doing?

12:53.814 --> 12:55.441
I don't know,
but we need to find them.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.526
(DRAMATICALLY) Release
the hounds.

12:59.278 --> 13:02.573
Lou, for the last time,
we don't have hounds!

13:03.741 --> 13:05.201
I know,
I just like saying it.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.540
Ravi!

13:12.958 --> 13:16.587
This better be important
whoever you are.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.340
Oh!

13:20.466 --> 13:21.717
We can't find Zuri
and Destiny.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.177
Didn't you put up
surveillance cameras

13:23.177 --> 13:25.262
around the camp
because you can't
control your kids?

13:25.679 --> 13:28.807
You know, normally people
are less critical
when they ask for a favor.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.685
Just show us
the footage
from last night.

13:31.894 --> 13:32.978
(SIGHING) Very well.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.734
This is the great lawn,
late last night.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.612
(CHUCKLING)
Is that you
breakdancing?

13:41.612 --> 13:43.280
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
No.

13:43.864 --> 13:45.199
Fast-forward.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.159
EMMA: Oh, wait.
That's them.
