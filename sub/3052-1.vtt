00:22.389 --> 00:25.024
Mother.
This is Raider 3-niner-5.

00:25.026 --> 00:27.426
I have the Jordanian
vessels in sight.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.495
Copy. Raider. 3-9-5.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.930
The Jordanians
have dropped their moorings and

00:31.932 --> 00:35.100
are headed to the designated
exercise area.

00:35.102 --> 00:38.037
Understood Raider 3-9-5.
You are cleared from surveillance.

00:38.039 --> 00:40.005
Return to Mother.

00:40.473 --> 00:42.041
Copy Mother.

00:42.043 --> 00:44.743
Heading home.

00:48.214 --> 00:52.985
Raider 3-9-5. Use ILS approach
07, call the ball.

00:52.987 --> 00:54.253
Will call, Mother.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.421
I have the ball.

00:55.423 --> 00:58.390
I am on ILS glideslope.

00:59.826 --> 01:02.027
I love this job.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.337
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

01:12.472 --> 01:14.840
Jesus Christ!

01:15.341 --> 01:18.377
Raider 395. You are off the
glideslope and too slow!

01:18.379 --> 01:20.180
Increase your speed and go
around.

01:20.181 --> 01:22.414
I repeat. Go around!

01:22.416 --> 01:23.482
Son of a bitch!

01:23.484 --> 01:26.385
Come on baby! Work with me!

01:26.387 --> 01:29.521
Raider 3-9-5. Eject! Eject!

01:29.523 --> 01:31.857
Punching out!

01:40.868 --> 01:45.804
Sea Hawk is in bound to retrieve
395. We're on our way.

01:49.409 --> 01:54.079
Water rescue alpha, we have his
position. Sending it to you now.

01:54.081 --> 01:57.883
Copy, ETA on scene in less than
one minute.

02:00.855 --> 02:06.091
I see him in the water! Got him
over here! Turn him over.

02:07.927 --> 02:10.027
He didn't make it.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.085
What do you think?

02:33.087 --> 02:34.019
We're picking up
extreme temperature

02:34.021 --> 02:36.455
-spikes all around us. -Sir.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.257
Island navigation is reporting

02:38.259 --> 02:40.225
multiple seismic anomalies.

02:40.227 --> 02:41.193
Is this a live feed?

02:41.195 --> 02:42.594
Yes, sir.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.663
It's not localized.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.432
It's the entire Arabian plate!

02:47.634 --> 02:49.668
Tell the Regan to lock
down the flight decks.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.836
Get everything
they can in the air.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.070
Notify the Jordanian fleet.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.112
Get me NAVCENT Bahrain
on the line, Now!

03:50.631 --> 03:52.297
Help!

05:17.083 --> 05:20.185
I'm pleased to be your tour
guide first thing this morning!

05:20.187 --> 05:23.188
I know it's a desert but I did not expect
it to be this hot at 8 in the morning.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.057
They are used to the warm
temperatures here.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.359
No! Too hot...

05:32.265 --> 05:34.399
The Pyramids were built over
4,500 years ago

05:34.401 --> 05:36.368
from 2.5 million stones.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.770
Now these tombs are more then
just burial sites.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.405
They are described through art,

05:40.407 --> 05:42.407
inscription and
text on the walls.

05:42.409 --> 05:45.744
And they tell us how these
people lived their daily lives.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.246
I'm learning so much more
actually being here than

05:48.248 --> 05:50.415
just studying it in school.

05:50.417 --> 05:53.352
Your mother was once a buyer for
Naufal & Sons,

05:53.354 --> 05:56.421
we spent so much time in this
part of the world.

05:56.423 --> 05:59.358
So, why couldn't mom come with
us?

05:59.360 --> 06:03.929
She's still out looking for regional
artwork for the new boutique.

06:03.931 --> 06:04.796
Oh!

06:04.798 --> 06:06.531
Sorry! Excuse me.

06:06.533 --> 06:09.267
I'm so clumsy sometimes.

06:09.635 --> 06:12.104
I see that you're reading about
the pyramid constructions?

06:12.106 --> 06:14.573
Yeah! This says it only took 20
years to build, but,

06:14.575 --> 06:17.275
I mean, that doesn't technically
make sense?

06:17.277 --> 06:21.313
I mean, 2.5 million stones being
brought in...

06:22.382 --> 06:24.649
- What?
- No! It's just that...

06:24.651 --> 06:27.152
I use to try figuring out
myself, you know?

06:27.154 --> 06:29.621
And all I did was confuse myself
even more.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.393
Bye.

06:41.467 --> 06:44.336
I want to see what's back here!

06:50.276 --> 06:51.376
Who was that?

06:51.378 --> 06:52.611
That was uh,

06:52.613 --> 06:57.582
someone paying their respects to
an old friend.

06:57.584 --> 07:02.621
Skilled workers stayed in the
temporary city near by...

07:02.623 --> 07:05.724
the Ancient Egyptians
created a piece of

07:05.726 --> 07:10.729
architecture made to
last an eternity.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.231
And even today their struggle to
survive makes anything we

07:13.233 --> 07:16.201
complain about just pale
in comparison.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.869
We don't struggle now?

07:17.871 --> 07:18.970
Not like they did!

07:18.972 --> 07:20.872
Besides, we have modern
conveniences,

07:20.874 --> 07:22.674
technology, toys...

07:22.676 --> 07:24.676
You mean like those new
conveniences and toys

07:24.678 --> 07:28.180
you put in the buildings
that you design?

07:28.182 --> 07:30.482
Speaking of toys, why don't you
put that thing away, Dylan.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.184
And join us.

07:32.186 --> 07:37.122
This is cool, Dad, but I'm stuck
in this one part of my game.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.093
Son of a bitch!

07:42.095 --> 07:43.895
Dylan! Language!

07:45.466 --> 07:47.399
What are you doing anyway?

07:47.767 --> 07:52.437
The bat is escaping these
monsters in this huge building.

07:52.439 --> 07:55.740
I have to use sound waves to guide them
to the next floor of the building.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.776
If you don't put that thing
away,

07:57.778 --> 08:00.579
you're going to escape this
ancient building only to wind up

08:00.581 --> 08:03.582
in a modern bedroom with
a month of no games!

08:03.584 --> 08:05.817
Fine! Jeez.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.553
So 2.5 million stones were used
in the construction

08:08.555 --> 08:11.212
of the pyramids. And it
took skilled workers

08:11.238 --> 08:13.692
closed to 20 years to
finish the project.

08:13.694 --> 08:16.661
Yeah, I saw an episode on the
Discovery Channel about that.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.863
Come on, we're missing
the tour!

08:17.865 --> 08:20.599
Amber, don't drive the tour
guide crazy!

09:01.341 --> 09:04.609
So we still have to make time for the
camel ride around the Sphinx at sunset!

09:04.611 --> 09:06.344
Um, maybe your mom can go with
you for that.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.779
- I'm up for whatever.
- Ok.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.214
Great tour Akram! I'm
really surprised that you

09:09.216 --> 09:12.517
didn't know that part about
the Valley Temple, though.

09:12.785 --> 09:15.554
Thank you for using Anubis
Tours!

09:16.322 --> 09:17.856
Sorry.

09:28.701 --> 09:30.735
Hi honey.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.038
I was able to get the pottery
supplier to meet my terms

09:33.040 --> 09:38.643
and found some amazing fertility sculptures
the clients are just gonna love.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.547
Well, the tour guide didn't even
mention that the Great Pyramid

09:42.549 --> 09:45.550
was once the tallest man-made
structure in the world,

09:45.552 --> 09:46.918
or that it's the oldest...

09:46.920 --> 09:49.654
Ok Amber! We don't care.

09:49.656 --> 09:51.890
The Pyramids were really
something,

09:51.892 --> 09:53.258
Weren't they, Dylan?

09:53.260 --> 09:57.295
It's too hot here, next year
we're going to Tahoe!

09:59.465 --> 10:01.633
Well, I'm starving.

10:01.867 --> 10:03.668
How about an early lunch?

10:03.670 --> 10:05.003
Hamburgers!

10:05.005 --> 10:07.939
I'm not eating mushed beans
again!

10:07.941 --> 10:10.108
You mean hummus Dylan?

10:10.110 --> 10:13.044
Maybe Amber can move here and be
a know-it-all tour guide!

10:13.046 --> 10:15.046
Oh, go play with your bats!

10:40.674 --> 10:43.041
No, no, no, no, no!

10:44.910 --> 10:46.911
Dad! Look!
It's that kid from the tour!

10:46.913 --> 10:49.981
Over there! Over there!
Go! Now! Now!

11:06.667 --> 11:07.666
Go!

11:14.174 --> 11:16.574
-I cannot thank you enough!
-Are you all right?

11:16.576 --> 11:17.842
I'm a bit shaky but
I'll be fine.

11:17.844 --> 11:18.943
- Tariq.
- Jack.

11:18.945 --> 11:22.013
- Oh my god! Jack! Are you ok?
- Yeah yeah!

11:22.548 --> 11:25.050
I'm gonna go and get help, ok?

11:25.052 --> 11:26.618
Jack!

11:30.790 --> 11:32.090
What is going on?

11:32.092 --> 11:34.843
-I cannot let you back in.
-What are we suppose to do?

11:34.869 --> 11:36.294
Where are we supposed to go?

11:36.296 --> 11:37.495
We're trying to help the injured
here, sir.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.831
Please wait with the others
where it's safe.

11:39.833 --> 11:42.153
We'll make sure to let you know
when we can assist you.

11:43.436 --> 11:46.438
-Well? -The hotel said we should
just stay here and somebody

11:46.440 --> 11:48.640
- Will come get us, ok?
- Ok.

11:48.808 --> 11:51.042
It's fine. It's fine.

12:31.651 --> 12:32.751
Anything?

12:32.753 --> 12:34.786
No, nothing!

12:34.788 --> 12:36.421
Have you seen anything on the
TV?

12:36.423 --> 12:40.892
Yes, the newscaster said it was the
Arabian Peninsula that shifted.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.127
What?

12:42.129 --> 12:44.696
The entire Arabian Peninsula
that shifted.

12:44.698 --> 12:46.931
There are earthquakes from here
to Dubai.

12:46.933 --> 12:48.266
Anything else?

12:48.268 --> 12:51.803
Uh, the edge of the Arabian
tectonic plate that runs

12:51.805 --> 12:53.271
down the middle of the
Red Sea parted,

12:53.273 --> 12:58.810
Exposing salt water directly to
magma for over 1,000 miles.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.545
The TV then went to static.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.114
Jack, I was able to get a hold
of my father,

13:03.116 --> 13:05.717
and he thinks this is much
bigger than it seems. Bigger?

13:14.293 --> 13:16.127
What did he just say?

13:16.129 --> 13:18.763
He says that you should go to the US
Embassy and you'll be safe there.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.665
- That sounds like...
- They're lying, Jack.

13:20.667 --> 13:25.570
-Why would they do that?
-Because that is the US Embassy.

13:25.572 --> 13:27.005
To keep people safe...

13:27.007 --> 13:28.239
and calm.

13:28.241 --> 13:32.243
What else did your father tell
you, Tariq?

13:32.378 --> 13:33.711
Jesus. What are these circles?

13:33.713 --> 13:37.148
Vaporized salt water is seeding
through the clouds.

13:37.150 --> 13:40.018
Creating a massive unstable
low-pressure system.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.854
He said that people in those
circles, need to evacuate

13:42.856 --> 13:45.089
immediately as temperature
will drop below zero

13:45.091 --> 13:48.259
making the whole area
inhabitable by sundown.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.761
Are we in this circle
right here?

13:49.763 --> 13:51.262
Yes.

13:51.264 --> 13:55.567
Ok, so there's lava and a cold
front and shifting plates...

13:55.901 --> 13:57.335
We need to go somewhere else?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.704
That's what it sounds like.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.317
It's salty!

14:12.319 --> 14:14.719
Ok, I'm thinking we need to get
to the airport and get back home.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.055
Babe, a plane isn't gonna be
able to fly in this!

14:17.057 --> 14:19.791
The US Embassy is in the heart
of the city over there.

14:19.793 --> 14:22.227
Um, yeah, that's not
going to happen.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.062
Can't we just find
shelter and stay here?

14:24.064 --> 14:28.066
No outside help is going to be able
to get in here if things get worse.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.235
We have to get out, Now!

14:30.636 --> 14:31.803
Ok.

14:32.638 --> 14:34.038
Let's see.

14:35.441 --> 14:36.808
Ok. Their airport is
right here, and it's outside

14:36.810 --> 14:39.644
of the city and it's away from
the tall buildings.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.347
Architecturally it's a very modern
building; it's probably the safest.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.749
Yeah, architecture will save us.

14:44.751 --> 14:45.950
I can't get in touch with my
father.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.986
I need to get in contact with
him again.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.821
You should definitely contact
your father.

14:49.823 --> 14:52.957
The temperature is
already dropping, Dad.

14:52.959 --> 14:56.628
Let's contact your father, after
we get to the airport.

14:58.097 --> 15:00.828
Look, we have to get out
of here before sundown.

15:00.854 --> 15:02.166
That's what? 7 o'clock?

15:02.168 --> 15:03.935
Yes, about that.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.203
Let's get a taxi.

15:05.205 --> 15:08.006
A taxi? No taxi is gonna come
through here.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.008
Nothing is gonna come to the
hotel!

15:10.010 --> 15:11.242
We'll take out chances.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.745
I appreciate everything you've
done for me,

15:13.747 --> 15:16.080
but I need to get in contact
with my father again.

15:16.082 --> 15:18.182
I understand all that, but
you have to come with us.

15:18.184 --> 15:21.052
Please, at least come with us to
the airport.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.087
I don't want to impose.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.989
We're in this together now.

15:24.991 --> 15:27.025
All right. Come on.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.596
Hey!

15:32.064 --> 15:33.197
Come on!

15:33.199 --> 15:34.299
Come on!

15:40.773 --> 15:42.173
Come on!

15:45.210 --> 15:46.277
Hey!

15:49.915 --> 15:50.648
Hey!

15:57.123 --> 15:58.289
Come on!

15:59.291 --> 16:01.326
Let's go! Let's go!

16:12.071 --> 16:13.137
Go!

16:18.711 --> 16:20.178
Mariam?

16:25.485 --> 16:28.152
Dylan, give me your bag.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.021
Here.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.357
We can use these to dry off.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.663
Thank you.

16:45.404 --> 16:48.072
So, Tariq, where are you from?

16:48.074 --> 16:49.941
I am from Jordan. That's...

16:49.943 --> 16:51.442
I know where that is.

16:51.444 --> 16:57.148
Of course you do. I left after
my father and I had an argument.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.484
What kind of argument?

16:59.486 --> 17:01.786
Dad! It's snowing!

17:01.954 --> 17:04.955
How's it snowing so fast?
Wow, look at the airport!

17:04.958 --> 17:09.426
It's completely covered. Dad, they'll
never let us fly out of there.

17:18.038 --> 17:20.505
Ok, we can use these to keep
warm.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.407
Just wrap your heads.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.985
Hello? Mariam?

17:34.420 --> 17:36.521
Dad, can we get on the plane?

17:36.523 --> 17:40.425
Yeah buddy, it's just like LAX
on a Monday morning, right?

17:44.464 --> 17:47.565
Mariam?

17:47.567 --> 17:48.933
Sir, can you keep it down?

17:48.935 --> 17:51.502
You're scaring the children.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.359
We haven't moved an
inch in 15 minutes.

18:15.361 --> 18:19.263
It's ok. It's ok. The safest place
for us right now is in this cab.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.232
Until we are inside the airport
gates.

18:21.234 --> 18:23.234
I don't wanna go out there!

18:23.236 --> 18:24.969
Then you don't have to.

18:29.042 --> 18:31.342
- Ok, I've had enough of that!
- Let me try.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.586
Hey!

18:43.923 --> 18:44.989
- Where is he going? Um...

18:52.932 --> 18:55.500
- Oh my god!
- Did you see that?

18:57.035 --> 18:58.603
How are the planes gonna be able
to take off?

18:58.605 --> 19:00.538
It's fine, they just uh...

19:00.540 --> 19:03.107
the de-ice the plane on the
runway.

19:03.109 --> 19:06.344
Dad, this is the desert. Do they
do that here?

19:06.545 --> 19:08.412
Do they?

19:09.948 --> 19:10.882
It's ok.

19:10.884 --> 19:12.517
You know what?

19:12.519 --> 19:16.320
We've gone about as far as we can
by car anyway. Why don't we...

19:16.322 --> 19:18.122
Are you sure about this?

19:18.124 --> 19:20.091
Yeah, I'm sure.

19:20.093 --> 19:21.559
Ok.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.897
All right, Amber, stay with mom. Dylan,
hold my hand and Tariq, try and keep up.

19:25.899 --> 19:27.198
You ready?

19:31.336 --> 19:33.571
Whoa. Keep up Dylan, OK?

19:33.573 --> 19:35.940
I'm trying! I'm trying!

19:37.911 --> 19:40.444
It's an ice age plane!

19:41.713 --> 19:42.647
My god.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.968
Jack!

20:03.970 --> 20:05.870
Look!

20:09.341 --> 20:10.675
Perfect.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.977
Come on.

20:27.392 --> 20:29.427
Wow! There's no one here.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.629
When is the next train?

20:33.599 --> 20:36.133
Dad, the landlines are down
too.

20:37.502 --> 20:39.637
The train comes through every hour. There
should be one leaving now. Come on.

20:39.639 --> 20:42.340
-Are you sure? -Yes, I don't just speak
Arabic, Jack. I can read it too.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.208
Right! Of course you can.

20:49.114 --> 20:50.181
Come on.

20:50.183 --> 20:52.383
I wish the snow would let up.

20:54.019 --> 20:55.353
Stick with me.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.554
Stick together.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.357
There's not gonna be
another train.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.459
Come on buddy. I gotcha.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.074
Honey!

21:18.510 --> 21:20.144
- Grab my hand!
- Mom!

21:21.714 --> 21:24.348
Come up! I got ya!

21:40.198 --> 21:42.033
- Wow!
- Dylan!

21:44.036 --> 21:45.703
Dylan! Dylan!

21:48.140 --> 21:50.541
Amber! No! Amber!

21:55.381 --> 21:57.114
Come on honey!

21:58.583 --> 22:00.384
You can make it!

22:02.788 --> 22:04.221
Come on!

22:09.127 --> 22:10.695
They're not gonna make it.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.196
On 3?

22:12.198 --> 22:13.564
Ok, 1.

22:13.566 --> 22:14.632
2.

22:14.634 --> 22:15.833
3!

22:21.274 --> 22:23.374
Honey, are you ok?

22:37.423 --> 22:38.856
Jack?

22:41.127 --> 22:42.760
Just give me a minute to think.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.428
Guys, don't fight. Not now!
Whoa! Jack!

22:44.430 --> 22:47.365
Calm down! If only we've gotten
there just a minute sooner.

22:47.367 --> 22:51.669
How in the world... How the hell are
we gonna find transportation now?

22:51.671 --> 22:54.872
I don't know. We'll figure something out.
Excuse me?

22:54.874 --> 22:57.571
Maybe we can go back to the
city and find a taxicab.

22:57.597 --> 22:58.843
It's gonna take us hours

22:58.845 --> 23:01.345
to get back to the city and find
a cab. We don't have time!

23:01.347 --> 23:03.180
- Excuse me!
- What?!

23:03.182 --> 23:05.216
I was able to get
a hold of my father.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.817
And he's sending
a pickup for us.

23:06.819 --> 23:09.220
We need to get down to the
highway quickly!

23:09.222 --> 23:11.288
Are the phones working now?

23:11.423 --> 23:12.757
Mine's still dead.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.291
Nothing on mine.

23:14.293 --> 23:15.593
Mine too.

23:15.595 --> 23:17.595
We have to move if you're going
to catch our ride.

23:17.597 --> 23:20.865
Right. You're right.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.134
I'm sorry.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.515
We need to be at mile marker at
17.

23:37.517 --> 23:38.449
There it is!

23:38.451 --> 23:40.384
Any minute now.

23:43.321 --> 23:46.457
They could drive right past us
and not even see us here.

23:47.325 --> 23:50.728
Quick, turn on the flashlights on
your phone and give them to me!

23:55.500 --> 23:56.867
Come on!

24:04.643 --> 24:07.278
Here they are! Everyone! Back!

24:07.412 --> 24:09.880
Why? It's just a pickup.

24:13.852 --> 24:15.553
Whoa!

24:15.555 --> 24:17.321
Come on guys!

24:18.423 --> 24:20.103
Come on guys! Let's go!

24:20.358 --> 24:22.126
Got your phones.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.895
- Who is this guy?
- You got me.

24:40.779 --> 24:42.947
Well if no body else is gonna
say anything...

24:42.949 --> 24:44.682
Who the hell are you?

24:44.684 --> 24:46.851
Dylan!

24:50.522 --> 24:51.589
Well?

24:51.591 --> 24:53.591
Who the hell are you?

24:54.759 --> 24:58.295
My father is a very important
person in Jordan.

24:58.297 --> 25:01.799
-How important? -Obviously very important
considering the ride we've got.

25:01.801 --> 25:04.735
-When you said pickup, I thought
you meant a truck. -No Crap!

25:04.737 --> 25:06.837
Dylan!

25:09.574 --> 25:10.875
It really isn't important.

25:10.877 --> 25:13.477
I think it's important.

25:13.612 --> 25:15.546
My father is the Minister of
Defense.

25:15.548 --> 25:20.451
All the large highways here were built as
secondary runways in case of emergency.

25:20.453 --> 25:22.353
Your bodyguards make sense now.

25:22.355 --> 25:27.892
I'm surprised you were in public even with
them after the uh, incident in Amman.

25:27.894 --> 25:31.729
So that's what you meant when
you said and argument.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.701
Oh my god!

25:46.311 --> 25:47.311
Everyone, hold on tight.

25:47.313 --> 25:48.746
Stay here.

25:53.519 --> 25:58.889
Suez Center, this is RJA
5150, come in Suez Center.

25:58.891 --> 26:01.025
I'm putting us on a heading
of 270 and dropping to

26:01.027 --> 26:03.827
5000 feet AGL to get below this.

26:08.967 --> 26:10.134
Can you fly into that?

26:10.136 --> 26:12.803
We don't have a choice, it's all
around us.

26:29.754 --> 26:30.988
I can't contact anyone anymore.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.189
The weather blocking off all
communication.

26:32.191 --> 26:33.557
I can't even get text on the
satellite link.

26:33.559 --> 26:36.660
That means my phone won't work
here anymore either.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.744
We can't fly into this!

26:57.783 --> 26:59.950
The engines are freezing up!

27:05.857 --> 27:08.359
GPS is down! I need a chart!

27:09.394 --> 27:11.462
We need the blue binder.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.364
Behind my seat!

27:20.005 --> 27:22.906
We aren't near any airports or
Highways.

27:22.908 --> 27:25.376
We need to set down! Now!

27:30.081 --> 27:33.083
We can come back around and put down here.
It's the safest place.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.152
A water landing? You crazy?

27:35.154 --> 27:37.321
Not exactly.

27:44.863 --> 27:46.764
Go back to your seats! This is
getting rough!

27:46.766 --> 27:49.566
Come on Jack. Their guys know
what they're doing.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.949
- Are we gonna make it?
- We're gonna make it.

28:07.652 --> 28:11.689
Heading 340, we're lined up
perfectly.

28:13.158 --> 28:14.825
Ok.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.894
Here we go.

28:18.630 --> 28:19.930
Gear is on green light.

28:19.932 --> 28:21.498
10 feet off the deck.

28:29.974 --> 28:31.709
Hold us up as long as you can.

28:31.711 --> 28:34.378
We don't know how thick the ice
is.

28:41.654 --> 28:42.886
Come on!

28:42.888 --> 28:44.455
Hold it!

28:45.690 --> 28:47.524
Hold it!

28:47.692 --> 28:50.461
Come on! Hold on!

29:00.505 --> 29:02.406
Hold it!

29:29.634 --> 29:31.835
We did it.

29:34.506 --> 29:36.974
Everyone get out as fast as you
can.

29:36.976 --> 29:38.509
- Come on kids.
- -The ice beneath us is

29:38.511 --> 29:41.578
breaking from the
weight of the plane!

29:45.917 --> 29:46.917
Watch out!

29:48.987 --> 29:50.053
Come on.

30:19.584 --> 30:23.187
Ashton! Look! Look over there!

30:29.594 --> 30:30.894
Mom! Help!

30:31.563 --> 30:35.933
Jack! Jack! He still
can't swim very well.

30:43.708 --> 30:45.642
Are you ok?

30:45.910 --> 30:47.878
My boy. Are you hurting?

30:47.880 --> 30:50.047
I'm not a very good swimmer yet.

30:50.281 --> 30:51.682
What are you doing out here?

30:51.684 --> 30:54.051
We're trying to make it to the
banks of the Red Sea.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.786
Are you crazy?

30:55.788 --> 30:57.688
The last tweets I was able to
read before the signal went down,

30:57.690 --> 31:00.128
were saying they was an
ongoing evacuation center.

31:00.154 --> 31:01.658
That's why we have to go there.

31:01.660 --> 31:04.027
It was something about the
weather.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.797
A warm zone next to the
eruption.

31:11.604 --> 31:12.836
What is he saying?

31:12.838 --> 31:14.204
I'm not quite sure, it doesn't
make sense.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.808
Excuse my husband. He
doesn't speak English.

31:17.810 --> 31:21.912
What he is trying to say is that we
believe that god will protect us.

31:21.914 --> 31:26.717
Just like he protected Moses and
the Israelites by the Red Sea.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.619
I know. I don't believe in god,
sir.

31:28.621 --> 31:33.257
You're going into the storm? Why
aren't you running from it?

31:33.259 --> 31:34.976
We would die of exposure
before we got a

31:35.002 --> 31:36.860
quarter of the way to
the nearest safe zone.

31:36.862 --> 31:38.862
The Red Sea is 1,000 miles long!

31:38.864 --> 31:41.298
Do you know the exact point of
the evacuation?

31:41.300 --> 31:44.401
I'm not buying this. It doesn't
make any sense.

31:44.403 --> 31:48.071
Actually, this all does make
sense.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.774
What does? Going into the storm?

31:50.776 --> 31:54.411
I flew a rescue mission into a
tropical depression once.

31:54.413 --> 31:58.081
Low on fuel, we were having a
hard time landing.

31:58.083 --> 32:02.386
Then all of a sudden, as if a
switch had been turned

32:02.388 --> 32:06.023
the wind died down and the skies
opened up.

32:06.025 --> 32:10.294
Ok, so it's calm in the eye of the storm,
but where is the eye of this storm?

32:10.296 --> 32:12.095
I-I still don't understand.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.997
Ok, one moment.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.067
Look.

32:18.469 --> 32:24.241
The magma is boiling the water
into the atmosphere. Here.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.209
And causing...

32:27.145 --> 32:30.847
an extreme cold front to
circulate here.

32:30.849 --> 32:36.286
And creating a narrow temperate zone
along the shores of the Red Sea here.

32:36.688 --> 32:40.924
And I know where the logical
evacuation point would be.

32:40.926 --> 32:42.559
Right here.

32:42.561 --> 32:46.129
Simon is right, and we are only
20 miles from it.

32:46.131 --> 32:49.066
I knew I was right. I knew we
were going the right direction.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.335
It is all God's will.

32:51.337 --> 32:56.006
Well whoever's will it is, we
have a plan.

32:57.241 --> 32:58.909
What do you think?

32:58.911 --> 33:02.946
I think our 6 should go
with their 4.

33:02.948 --> 33:05.349
I think you're right.

33:05.351 --> 33:07.751
God, I love you.

33:14.459 --> 33:17.461
We don't have a lot of time to
get them out of here.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.229
Ok.

33:19.231 --> 33:24.034
If we don't get out of here by
sundown, the storm will cut us off...

33:24.036 --> 33:30.140
and by my calculations, we really
will freeze to death out here.

33:34.979 --> 33:37.080
Ok. Let's go.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.282
I shouldn't get my hopes up.

34:45.284 --> 34:50.920
I think this is what the call a
temporary reprieve. It won't last.

34:56.893 --> 34:58.929
What's this?

35:06.204 --> 35:07.404
Dad!

35:13.578 --> 35:15.979
It's a camel farm.

35:17.982 --> 35:19.483
Amber.

35:19.485 --> 35:23.453
I think you're gonna get that
camel ride at sunset after all.

35:47.078 --> 35:54.451
Ok, lets get these camels
settled up... and ready to ride.

35:55.119 --> 35:56.119
Wow.

35:56.954 --> 35:59.122
This is really happening, isn't
it?

36:00.191 --> 36:04.261
It looks like our luck my have
ran out with the weather.

36:04.395 --> 36:06.329
Look, blankets.

36:06.631 --> 36:08.965
I think we'll have to double up.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.167
I'm riding with you.

36:10.169 --> 36:12.068
Of course!

36:18.176 --> 36:20.377
-Have you ever ridden a horse before?
-Yes I have!

36:20.379 --> 36:22.045
It's nothing like that.

36:22.047 --> 36:25.549
On a horse your legs dangle on the
side with stirrups for support.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.184
Ok, show me.

36:27.186 --> 36:29.252
See this saddle post?

36:30.688 --> 36:33.423
Your legs wrap around the front
and when the camel moves,

36:33.425 --> 36:36.626
You move rhythmically with the
camel for balance.

36:36.628 --> 36:37.561
You go that, Amber?

36:37.563 --> 36:39.496
Yeah, I think so.

36:39.964 --> 36:42.098
Just follow me and you'll be
fine.

36:44.435 --> 36:45.468
Time?

36:45.603 --> 36:48.638
He right, time is getting away
from us!

36:48.640 --> 36:50.173
Let's go.

37:43.996 --> 37:45.528
Hey Dad!

37:46.931 --> 37:50.033
You know how when you're in the
desert you can see a mirage?

37:50.035 --> 37:51.935
Of course, son.

37:53.537 --> 37:56.940
When you're in the desert can you
see a mirage when it's snowing?

37:59.477 --> 38:01.144
What are you seeing, Dylan?

38:01.146 --> 38:03.179
Something shinny.

38:05.316 --> 38:07.717
It's glittering up ahead.

38:08.619 --> 38:11.254
It looks like a mini pyramid!

38:14.725 --> 38:17.694
Maybe it's a marker for
something!

38:17.828 --> 38:20.509
-Dylan! Dylan, please be careful!
-Whoa!

38:25.770 --> 38:28.004
Slow down, Dylan!

38:41.786 --> 38:44.254
- Dylan!
- Dylan!

38:48.359 --> 38:49.626
Jack!

38:59.437 --> 39:00.904
- Are you hurt?
- I think so.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.173
You can't run off like that.

39:03.307 --> 39:05.508
You could have got yourself
killed!

39:05.643 --> 39:08.211
Are you both ok?

39:08.346 --> 39:11.548
Come on, we need help! We need
to keep heading east!

39:11.550 --> 39:15.185
Great idea, but are we going to
get the camels down?

39:15.187 --> 39:16.886
Well, I'm not sure we can
do that!

39:16.888 --> 39:21.191
We could cut them open for warmth
like the Empire Strikes back?

39:21.193 --> 39:24.327
We'll shoo them off and they'll
find their way back home.

39:24.329 --> 39:27.230
Are you sure you're both ok?

39:27.232 --> 39:30.367
- We're ok! It's the side of
a pyramid, slide down. Ok!

39:59.130 --> 40:03.266
Cap? Is that a piece of
your plane?

40:03.268 --> 40:08.638
Sure is. This must be
where we circled back.

40:09.607 --> 40:11.808
This sucks!

40:12.276 --> 40:14.744
Please tell me we're not
screwed.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.447
Yeah, we kinda are.

40:17.449 --> 40:20.283
Actually we need to keep heading
east.

40:20.818 --> 40:24.554
-Any luck, Tariq? -No, but I have
to get in touch with my father.

40:24.556 --> 40:30.693
There's no way, Tariq. There's no safety,
there's no higher ground, this is it!

40:30.695 --> 40:37.600
Jack, less then 9 miles.
Less then 3 hours, Jack.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.105
And look at that!

40:44.675 --> 40:46.810
We need to keep moving...

40:46.944 --> 40:49.779
A detour now will double how far
we have to go.

40:49.781 --> 40:53.183
Tariq, I would love to have your
father's help!

40:53.185 --> 40:56.314
But this is all we have
now and we have a chance.

40:56.340 --> 40:57.754
We have to keep going.

40:57.756 --> 41:00.757
We have to do this together.

41:00.759 --> 41:04.794
There is still hope, right?

41:04.796 --> 41:06.496
Dad, I think Tariq's father can
help us.

41:06.498 --> 41:10.533
He has the means... How? How are
we gonna do that Amber? How?

41:10.535 --> 41:12.569
- Dad! I believe him!
- How?!

41:12.571 --> 41:14.637
Dad, do you think we're gonna
survive out here?

41:14.639 --> 41:19.342
No! We're gonna die! When all we
have is this first aid kit?

41:20.878 --> 41:22.812
Amber. Amber. It's ok.

41:22.814 --> 41:26.416
Guys, listen to me!

41:26.717 --> 41:30.253
I know Tariq's got great ideas, and
you've been a huge help to us.

41:30.255 --> 41:33.623
But we're beyond outside help.

41:33.625 --> 41:40.530
We have to go on as we are, as best
we know how, on our own. On foot.

41:40.532 --> 41:42.932
He's-He's right.

41:42.934 --> 41:47.003
Trying to find high ground where
I might get a call is pointless.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.538
I'll try on the way.

41:48.540 --> 41:51.574
This is our only chance.

41:52.676 --> 41:54.444
Do you hear something?

41:54.446 --> 41:56.546
Over there!

41:58.516 --> 42:01.551
Hey!

42:01.553 --> 42:05.622
Over here!

42:05.624 --> 42:07.824
Hey!

42:07.826 --> 42:09.425
Dylan! No! Wait!

42:09.427 --> 42:11.895
Dylan! That was our only flare!
Come on, Come on Simon,

42:11.897 --> 42:13.930
Let's cut them off!
Somebody up there heard us!

42:13.932 --> 42:16.666
You're getting religious
on me now too?

42:16.668 --> 42:21.771
If people have the will,
they can control their destiny.

42:37.622 --> 42:39.556
He saw our plane go down.

42:42.761 --> 42:45.028
He saw pieces flying and
then he followed.

42:45.030 --> 42:47.150
Please, you have to help us get
out of here.

42:53.371 --> 42:56.973
He said that the storm is ending and
that they are looking for supplies.

42:56.975 --> 43:00.476
End? No, things are about to get
a lot worse.

43:08.652 --> 43:12.555
Please! You can't just leave us!

43:14.859 --> 43:16.826
Come on!

43:30.541 --> 43:31.874
Heat! Heat!

43:31.876 --> 43:36.012
That's the first heat we've felt
in a... long time.

43:36.014 --> 43:38.648
Enjoy while it last, buddy.

44:08.679 --> 44:09.946
Where are we?

44:09.948 --> 44:11.681
It's an oil refinery.

44:18.823 --> 44:20.857
They have been gathering
supplies.

44:20.859 --> 44:26.129
These locals made this their base camp
after the employees were evacuated.

44:26.131 --> 44:29.632
Can we get some food?
We're famished.

44:37.942 --> 44:38.808
Is he serious?

44:38.810 --> 44:42.745
Just um, let him talk.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.932
What's that about?

45:02.934 --> 45:05.601
The village where they got most
of the supplies, many of the

45:05.603 --> 45:07.570
people were killed
by the earthquake.

45:07.572 --> 45:11.874
Finding what they needed was much easier
and more plentiful than they expected.

45:12.609 --> 45:16.579
What did you say...
Uh Amber! Um...

45:16.581 --> 45:17.947
Just go eat some food.

45:17.949 --> 45:19.849
It's ok.

45:24.655 --> 45:25.922
What did you offer?

45:25.924 --> 45:28.725
You don't wanna know.

45:34.698 --> 45:37.633
I gotta thank you for everything
you've don for us.

45:37.635 --> 45:39.555
I have one more favor to ask
you.

45:43.040 --> 45:48.611
How many of those work trucks
can you spare?

45:57.087 --> 45:58.788
You are leaving now?

45:58.790 --> 46:03.092
We heard that there's an evacuation
center in the banks of the Red Sea.

46:04.161 --> 46:07.029
This storm isn't temporary.

46:07.164 --> 46:11.033
It's getting colder and colder
by the minute.

46:12.069 --> 46:15.738
I just want to get my family to
safety before sundown...

46:15.740 --> 46:17.140
when things get really bad.

46:17.142 --> 46:20.143
How do you know there's an
evacuation point waiting?

46:20.145 --> 46:21.811
That's what we heard.

46:23.515 --> 46:25.848
So you're going on faith?

46:26.717 --> 46:28.551
Yeah I guess we are.

46:42.099 --> 46:43.599
- Move!
- Get outta the way!

46:43.601 --> 46:46.536
- Go!
- Get outta the way!

47:09.960 --> 47:13.696
Do your really not see how
dangerous it is to stay here?

47:16.867 --> 47:18.034
Come on.

47:18.168 --> 47:19.602
Come over here.

47:19.604 --> 47:21.804
Tell them what I'm saying.

47:24.942 --> 47:27.310
We've heard...

47:27.312 --> 47:30.680
There is an evacuation center.

47:30.682 --> 47:34.784
On the banks of the Red Sea.

47:34.786 --> 47:37.186
We are leaving...

47:37.188 --> 47:40.957
in those trucks.

47:40.959 --> 47:46.562
If you stay here, you will
freeze to death.

47:56.073 --> 48:01.911
We have heat and supplies.

48:03.882 --> 48:05.314
That will last us for days.

48:06.551 --> 48:08.317
Weeks even.

48:09.687 --> 48:11.721
If you want to leave...

48:13.224 --> 48:16.259
based on rumors and whispers...

48:19.063 --> 48:22.565
then you will be on your own.

48:24.968 --> 48:26.769
Dylan?

48:27.905 --> 48:30.673
Do you have some snacks for the
road?

48:30.675 --> 48:34.043
I got some cheesy crackers.
I'm good.

48:39.149 --> 48:41.918
Thank you for everything you've
done.

48:41.920 --> 48:45.755
You saved our lives and I won't
forget that.

48:56.333 --> 49:00.770
I want you two to ride in the
cab of the truck. Not the back.

49:00.971 --> 49:03.105
You go with your mother.
Dylan, you come with me.

49:03.107 --> 49:04.774
I wanna go with the Captain!

49:04.776 --> 49:07.310
Dylan you heard your father!

49:07.312 --> 49:09.879
He is a Captain.

49:12.416 --> 49:16.886
All right, Dylan. But if Captain Kawar
tells you to do something, you do it.

49:16.888 --> 49:19.055
Ok mom, cool!

49:19.057 --> 49:22.358
Come on boy, you ride in the cab
with me.

49:22.360 --> 49:24.327
Ok well if Dylan is riding in
the cab with Captain Kawar

49:24.329 --> 49:27.930
then I wanna ride with...
- I don't think so.

49:58.228 --> 50:00.296
I hope they know what they're
doing.

50:33.531 --> 50:35.131
Is that hail?

50:35.133 --> 50:37.133
It's huge!

51:34.024 --> 51:37.259
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Bloody hell.

51:39.029 --> 51:40.996
They should have left.

51:49.406 --> 51:51.807
No!!

52:11.528 --> 52:14.463
Dylan, are you ok?

52:20.203 --> 52:22.238
Are you all right?

52:22.240 --> 52:24.306
I don't know.

52:25.008 --> 52:27.209
Amber! Amber! No wait!

52:41.892 --> 52:43.559
- Amber!
- Tariq!

52:43.561 --> 52:46.829
Tariq. Ouch! Ouch!

52:47.664 --> 52:51.100
Get in the truck! You're going
to get killed!

53:05.415 --> 53:08.317
Amber, Honey!
How are you feeling?

53:08.319 --> 53:10.319
I'll be ok, Dad. Don't worry
about me.

53:10.321 --> 53:14.456
Can you move your arm? Here.
I'll put it in a sling.

53:14.458 --> 53:16.292
Amber, baby you're bleeding.

53:16.294 --> 53:19.595
- Dad, I'm fine.
- There you go.

53:19.729 --> 53:21.363
It's ok.

53:21.698 --> 53:23.098
It's a Tariq-niquet...

53:23.100 --> 53:26.202
There she is. I told you, she
was going to be fine.

53:26.204 --> 53:28.871
Amber, where were you hit?

53:30.006 --> 53:31.674
It's probably broken, actually.

53:31.676 --> 53:36.378
We gotta keep the fracture
isolated or it becomes compounded.

53:38.982 --> 53:40.983
Dylan, are you ok?

53:40.985 --> 53:43.118
I'm fine, mom.

53:45.021 --> 53:46.989
It's just a little blood.

53:46.991 --> 53:51.060
Good God! Eww! That
disgusting, Dylan!

53:51.062 --> 53:53.495
I'm glad you're riding with us.

53:53.497 --> 53:54.730
I wanna ride with the Captain!

53:54.732 --> 53:56.432
Dylan that's not a question!

53:56.434 --> 53:58.267
You're riding with us.

53:58.269 --> 54:00.069
Sit with me.

54:02.305 --> 54:04.139
Right.

54:04.141 --> 54:06.075
Hour and a half till sunset.

54:06.077 --> 54:07.643
Ok, this is it.

54:07.645 --> 54:09.111
We're almost there.

54:09.113 --> 54:10.646
Ok.

54:30.734 --> 54:35.137
Captain, do you know how much
longer do we have left?

54:35.139 --> 54:38.507
We-we're almost to the top of
this hill.

54:38.509 --> 54:43.145
And across the narrow valley, up the
valley wall, and we will be there.

54:43.147 --> 54:45.414
So not very far.

54:45.416 --> 54:47.449
Don't worry.

55:02.632 --> 55:05.067
Is everything ok, Captain?

55:05.069 --> 55:07.202
Captain?

55:07.204 --> 55:09.571
I'm not sure.

55:17.113 --> 55:19.581
Everyone, stay here.

55:37.467 --> 55:39.635
What are you looking at?

55:39.637 --> 55:45.074
I swear, I can see something
through the storm out there.

55:45.542 --> 55:49.611
Through some swirls of the
storm, I thought I saw...

55:49.613 --> 55:51.780
Ah.

55:57.654 --> 55:59.154
Is that the evac point?

55:59.156 --> 56:03.625
It could be but, I thought we
had one more ridge to cross.

56:04.561 --> 56:07.129
Dad! Stop!

56:07.131 --> 56:08.230
Don't move!

56:08.232 --> 56:12.234
Why? I told you stay in the
truck!

56:31.421 --> 56:33.756
You ok, buddy?

56:33.890 --> 56:35.924
That was close.

56:35.926 --> 56:38.699
That could be a temporary
runway, but I don't

56:38.725 --> 56:41.255
see what could be
flying in this weather?

56:41.531 --> 56:43.599
Please the me the cell phones
work now.

56:43.601 --> 56:50.439
No, still no signal, but I cached the maps
for the whole area before we left London.

56:50.907 --> 56:53.308
You see that point?

56:53.576 --> 56:56.278
That's that point there.

56:56.280 --> 56:58.414
And this one?

56:58.416 --> 57:00.115
Is that point there.

57:00.117 --> 57:05.521
And that means that must be the evacuation!
-It's amazing, Ashton.

57:05.523 --> 57:08.690
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Slow down
their cowboy. Let me see that.

57:22.505 --> 57:24.106
Think quick.

57:24.441 --> 57:26.375
You were looking at it
backwards.

57:29.280 --> 57:31.847
That point is the opposite of
what you said.

57:31.849 --> 57:35.317
We still need to cross the valley,
but that's not what worries me.

57:35.319 --> 57:37.186
- That's not what worries me?
- No.

57:37.188 --> 57:41.957
What worries me is that
according to that map,

57:41.959 --> 57:46.161
there should be a road right
there.

57:46.429 --> 57:49.298
It must have been washed away in
the storm.

57:49.300 --> 57:51.500
- That's what I'm thinking.
- We still need to go that way.

57:51.502 --> 57:54.470
Those lights could still
be the evac center!

57:54.671 --> 57:58.807
It could be but I don't know
how we're going to do it.

58:01.377 --> 58:04.513
About how far down does the
cliff go?

58:10.487 --> 58:12.554
About 80 feet.

58:12.556 --> 58:14.389
Why, Dylan?

58:14.391 --> 58:16.692
We could use that.

58:20.598 --> 58:23.599
Why that would be how
we are going to do it.

58:37.981 --> 58:41.016
And I told my dad I
didn't want and office job.

58:41.018 --> 58:42.417
What was that, Tariq?

58:42.419 --> 58:43.585
Nothing!

58:52.295 --> 58:54.363
Take it back up!

58:56.900 --> 58:57.956
You ok there, buddy?

58:57.982 --> 59:00.702
Yes, I'm fine. I'm worried
about Amber though.

59:00.704 --> 59:04.673
I am too Tariq. I am too.

59:07.844 --> 59:09.344
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
- Hey hey!

59:09.346 --> 59:10.746
Take it easy there!

59:10.748 --> 59:13.649
Yeah! Sorry about that!

59:13.651 --> 59:14.650
Ok Amber, you're next.

59:14.652 --> 59:16.451
Mom?

59:16.453 --> 59:19.821
You'll will be ok, honey. Look how
thick and strong that steel cable is.

59:19.823 --> 59:23.325
And it's attached to a 2-ton
truck.

59:23.327 --> 59:25.327
That's not going anywhere.

59:25.329 --> 59:27.429
Let's get this over with.

59:27.431 --> 59:29.665
I've got you, Amber.

59:29.799 --> 59:33.235
Just lean back and I will lower
you down.

59:35.772 --> 59:39.308
Ok, lean your weight on
the cable.

59:40.343 --> 59:41.977
And I will set you down like a
feather.

59:41.979 --> 59:43.745
Ok?

59:44.380 --> 59:46.481
Oh no no no no!

59:47.083 --> 59:49.384
Amber! Don't look down!

59:49.386 --> 59:51.887
Just look at the rocks in front
of you.

59:52.488 --> 59:54.690
It's ok, I've got it.

01:00:00.663 --> 01:00:04.766
Ash! Lock that truck down, now!

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:29.524
Quick! Lock it down!

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:36.298
I'm doing the best I can!
It is sliding on the ice!

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:53.649
We need to hurry this up now! We
need to get everyone down!

01:00:53.651 --> 01:00:59.688
Get some rocks behind those
tires to block them! Please!

01:01:10.466 --> 01:01:11.400
Are you ok?

01:01:11.402 --> 01:01:13.468
I'm not sure...

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:18.006
I'm ok.

01:01:32.989 --> 01:01:34.823
Here we go.

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:45.033
You're doing great!

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:49.838
Are you ok?

01:01:52.775 --> 01:01:53.975
Are you all right?

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:03.085
Diane!

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:10.726
Hold on!

01:02:20.104 --> 01:02:22.504
Diane! Hang on, ok?!

01:02:22.506 --> 01:02:23.872
Hang on!

01:02:25.108 --> 01:02:26.708
Hang on!

01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:50.565
Ash!

01:02:50.567 --> 01:02:52.200
Dad! Look out!

01:02:55.805 --> 01:02:57.439
Ash!

01:03:12.856 --> 01:03:14.289
Dylan!

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:17.025
Tell everyone to wait here while
we check out those lights.

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:18.827
Ok, Dad!

01:03:26.602 --> 01:03:28.537
Dad, come quick.

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:47.055
Come on. Come on, Amber. You don't
need to see that. Let's go.

01:03:47.057 --> 01:03:48.924
Come on.

01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:10.245
How in the world they get
down here?

01:04:15.651 --> 01:04:19.855
I found a maze of switchbacks on
the map on Ashton's phone.

01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:28.897
I helped too.

01:04:28.899 --> 01:04:33.301
Good job.

01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:35.537
Good job, son!

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:22.050
I'm freezing Dad. Does
the heater even work?

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:24.653
It's on as high as it can get.

01:05:31.394 --> 01:05:33.695
What is that?

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:39.601
Oh my god.

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:51.880
Jack! This is the evacuation
point, right here!

01:05:51.882 --> 01:05:54.716
- Simon! Calm down!

01:05:54.718 --> 01:05:56.918
Stop the truck now!

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.358
Son of a bitch!

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:16.104
Everybody out. We're on foot
from here.

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:17.872
Everybody out!

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:43.131
Simon, what's going on?

01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:45.800
Guys, this is the evac point!

01:06:45.802 --> 01:06:47.736
Look at the security fences and
guard booths!

01:06:47.738 --> 01:06:49.704
It's here!

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:53.141
Jack?

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:55.276
It's a dam!

01:06:58.114 --> 01:07:00.148
Now that...

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:02.384
is impressive.

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:07.789
That is the Safaga dam.

01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:10.392
The Red Sea and the Evac point
on the other side.

01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:16.064
They must have shuttling people across,
and abandoned it when the storm got bad.

01:07:16.066 --> 01:07:19.267
The valley wall is only 50
meters over there.

01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:21.936
It is just through the... Aah!

01:07:29.912 --> 01:07:32.247
Aftershock?

01:07:32.249 --> 01:07:34.449
Let-let's get the truck out.

01:07:34.451 --> 01:07:37.819
That's not an aftershock, it's
the DAM!

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:05.880
Damn.

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:11.019
Can you believe that?

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.390
Tariq?

01:08:16.393 --> 01:08:17.358
Did you hear that?

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.060
Yes.

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:22.964
Ah!

01:08:22.966 --> 01:08:25.533
What are you whining about?

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:36.511
Everybody up the valley wall!

01:08:36.879 --> 01:08:39.380
Move move move, Now!

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.428
Aah!

01:08:55.464 --> 01:08:57.499
Tomas!

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:30.198
We're in an abandoned
phosphate mine.

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:32.399
Honey?

01:09:32.402 --> 01:09:34.368
Are you ok?

01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:38.173
Yeah mom, I'm ok.

01:09:39.575 --> 01:09:42.042
There's no way we're getting out
that way, are we?

01:09:42.045 --> 01:09:47.515
I don't think so, we're gonna have
to find another way out of here.

01:09:47.517 --> 01:09:50.151
Ok, don't let go of my hand.

01:09:50.153 --> 01:09:52.386
You don't let go of my hand!

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:56.491
All right.

01:09:56.692 --> 01:09:58.226
Ok.

01:10:03.432 --> 01:10:05.466
This isn't doing very much, ay.

01:10:05.468 --> 01:10:07.068
I don't know which way to go.

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.237
Mom, mom, give me the phone!

01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:11.973
-Why? -Just give it
me for a second.

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:14.976
Honey, what are you doing?

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:19.714
Mom, it's just like my game!

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:22.050
We can use our breath to guide
us out.

01:10:22.052 --> 01:10:26.354
Now we are the bats and our
breath is the sound!

01:10:26.356 --> 01:10:30.191
Of course, cause the airflow
must lead to an opening!

01:10:30.193 --> 01:10:31.459
That's brilliant!

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:34.062
It's going this way.

01:10:34.064 --> 01:10:35.230
Ok.

01:10:41.605 --> 01:10:43.404
Be careful.

01:10:46.642 --> 01:10:49.711
Diane! Dylan!

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:58.052
Jack! We're over here!

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:03.358
Oh my god. Oh my god.

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:05.260
You ok?

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:07.195
Yeah.

01:11:13.637 --> 01:11:16.604
Yeah! Your son is brilliant!

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:22.277
-Aah! -Amber! Hey!
Whoa whoa whoa!

01:11:24.079 --> 01:11:25.246
Can you stand?

01:11:25.248 --> 01:11:27.181
I think-I think so.

01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:32.120
Whoa whoa whoa! Take it easy. Take it easy.
Don't put pressure on your shoulder.

01:11:32.254 --> 01:11:33.755
Jack!

01:11:33.757 --> 01:11:36.124
Amber's getting worse.

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:37.659
You think you can walk?

01:11:37.661 --> 01:11:40.028
Yeah, I think so.

01:11:40.030 --> 01:11:43.031
Come on. Come on. Easy. Easy.

01:11:43.232 --> 01:11:45.366
Yes, yes, I can walk.

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.236
We need to move fast.

01:11:48.238 --> 01:11:50.138
There isn't much light left.

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:13.394
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:13:45.888 --> 01:13:48.489
Oh you gotta be kidding me.

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:51.859
It is from the bowels of hell.

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:55.363
- We can't go through that!
- I know. I know.

01:13:55.365 --> 01:13:57.832
It's just wind! It can't stop us
now!

01:13:57.834 --> 01:13:59.801
No no no! Stop!

01:13:59.803 --> 01:14:01.502
Stop!

01:14:04.206 --> 01:14:06.641
No no no! Stop! Stop!

01:14:06.643 --> 01:14:08.810
I can make it through!

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:14.348
Oh my god!

01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:19.220
Oh my god!

01:14:20.923 --> 01:14:24.621
I have an idea! The
crevasse we came out of.

01:14:24.647 --> 01:14:26.594
There's other passages.

01:14:26.596 --> 01:14:29.263
Let's go! Fast!

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:37.538
We came out right here.

01:14:45.380 --> 01:14:46.814
Amber, what is it?

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:49.617
Can you feel it?

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:51.619
The air.

01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:53.054
It's warm! Come on!

01:14:53.056 --> 01:14:55.957
Amber wait! You're gonna
get lost in there!

01:14:55.959 --> 01:14:57.592
I am not going in there!

01:14:57.594 --> 01:15:00.628
Then you are going to die out
here!

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.566
Can you hear it?

01:15:05.568 --> 01:15:06.601
Hear what?

01:15:06.603 --> 01:15:09.704
Ssh! Listen!

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:11.873
Rushing water! It's not frozen!

01:15:11.875 --> 01:15:13.641
Amber. Stop. Stop. Dad,
remember this whole

01:15:13.643 --> 01:15:18.980
thing started from volcanic activity!
And we're going to warm area!

01:15:18.982 --> 01:15:20.615
Yeah?

01:15:20.749 --> 01:15:22.950
The water is warm!

01:15:23.085 --> 01:15:25.486
Of course it is!

01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:26.954
You can feel it in the air.

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:34.362
- Amber, stop! Stop! Stop!
- Amber!

01:16:28.651 --> 01:16:30.551
Ok. Jack!

01:16:30.686 --> 01:16:31.886
Jack!

01:16:31.888 --> 01:16:33.454
Amber!

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:35.957
Oh, Amber!

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:37.391
Jack!

01:16:37.393 --> 01:16:39.760
We need to get her!

01:16:40.862 --> 01:16:43.564
Boost me up, Ok?

01:16:43.566 --> 01:16:44.732
Go!

01:16:52.841 --> 01:16:54.842
Easy!

01:16:54.844 --> 01:16:57.345
Come on.

01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:09.457
Jack! She needs medical
attention.

01:17:09.459 --> 01:17:10.992
Dylan?

01:17:10.994 --> 01:17:12.627
Dylan?

01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:13.728
Dylan?

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:14.895
Dylan! Dylan!

01:17:14.897 --> 01:17:19.734
Dad, go help mom find Dylan!
-Dylan!

01:17:19.736 --> 01:17:24.805
- Dylan!
- He's not here, Jack!

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:25.906
Dylan!

01:17:25.908 --> 01:17:28.142
Jack! I'm serious! She needs
help!

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:31.345
Stay there! Hold on!

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.549
See that rushing water? Maybe he
shot out into the ocean?

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:42.023
Jack! Amber, Now!

01:17:48.398 --> 01:17:49.697
Come on!

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:55.436
Easy.

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.606
Come on!

01:18:04.814 --> 01:18:05.913
Dylan!

01:18:05.915 --> 01:18:09.383
Dylan! Dylan!

01:18:14.022 --> 01:18:16.590
Dylan!

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.026
Dylan!

01:18:20.729 --> 01:18:22.763
Dylan! Dylan!

01:18:22.765 --> 01:18:28.035
Dylan! Dylan!

01:18:30.006 --> 01:18:32.673
Dylan!

01:18:33.508 --> 01:18:35.509
I can't.

01:18:35.944 --> 01:18:39.146
I can't see him anywhere.

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:43.751
- Jack! Jack!
- Dad!

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:46.687
Please help! -Daddy! It's going to be ok!
-Jack! Can you hear me?

01:18:46.689 --> 01:18:49.090
Help! Please! I don't
know what happened?

01:18:49.092 --> 01:18:51.459
Jack, can you hear me?

01:18:51.461 --> 01:18:53.894
Sir! Can you hear me, sir?

01:18:54.996 --> 01:18:56.464
Can you hear me, sir?

01:18:56.466 --> 01:18:57.765
What's wrong? What's going on?

01:18:57.767 --> 01:19:00.334
He's in shock. Get me the
backboard and blankets.

01:19:00.336 --> 01:19:01.435
Jack?

01:19:01.437 --> 01:19:03.504
Give him some space.

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:11.712
So, I'm going to place you on this
backboard and carry to the triage area.

01:19:11.847 --> 01:19:14.148
-You're gonna be ok. Just hang on.
-Lift his head.

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:16.784
Dad! Dad! Dad! Wake up!

01:19:19.087 --> 01:19:21.088
Dad! Dad! Wake up!

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:39.640
What happened?

01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:41.642
Tariq's boat picked me up!

01:19:41.644 --> 01:19:43.711
What?

01:19:43.713 --> 01:19:45.576
Well, it's not my boat.
My father and had half

01:19:45.602 --> 01:19:47.281
the Navy in the Red Sea
when this happened

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:52.019
and it looks like they took the
lead in the rescue operation.

01:19:52.021 --> 01:19:53.087
It was so cool!

01:19:53.089 --> 01:19:54.555
I shot out of the cave and into
the air,

01:19:54.557 --> 01:19:57.792
Then into the ocean, and then I
was pulled up on the boat...

01:19:57.794 --> 01:19:59.823
and we were jumping waves!
it was so much fun!

01:19:59.849 --> 01:20:01.162
-Whoa whoa! Of course you did!

01:20:01.164 --> 01:20:02.897
Of course you did, buddy.

01:20:02.899 --> 01:20:04.765
Of course you did.

01:20:17.913 --> 01:20:20.714
It's all so surreal.

01:20:26.823 --> 01:20:29.623
Just glad our family made it.

01:20:32.961 --> 01:20:35.796
So many others didn't.
