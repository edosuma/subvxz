00:02.628 --> 00:03.708
ZOE: I got offered
early admission

00:03.837 --> 00:06.374
to an undergrad
pre-med program
at Harvard.

00:07.591 --> 00:10.333
SARAH: I still can't
believe our little girl
is leaving home.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.505
This isn't
how I pictured
it going for us, either.

00:12.638 --> 00:13.844
Yeah, bad timing.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.348
Come here, Tess.
Mmm.

00:15.474 --> 00:19.433
A private funder is
building a new ultra-large
radio telescope array,

00:19.561 --> 00:20.971
and they need
someone to run it.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.514
And where is it?

00:22.648 --> 00:23.979
Australia.

00:24.316 --> 00:25.647
That's far.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.607
TESS: I don't
have you here.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.191
lt's notjust
the distance, is it?

00:32.074 --> 00:34.565
| just don't know
if I can do it anymore.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.612
Bye, Jack.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.490
Bye, Tess.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.698
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

00:53.804 --> 00:54.964
Hey, Henry!

00:55.973 --> 00:56.928
Nice ride!

00:57.057 --> 00:58.046
Jack.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.559
A classic.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.768
1947 Chrysler New Yorker.

01:02.938 --> 01:03.848
Wow.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.596
Isn't that
something?
Yeah.

01:06.108 --> 01:08.645
Sadly not mine
and, at the moment,
not running.

01:08.777 --> 01:10.392
Where's your tow truck
when you need it, huh?

01:10.529 --> 01:11.860
Yeah, if only
there were two of me.

01:11.989 --> 01:14.025
Oh, don't tempt fate.

01:14.157 --> 01:16.148
Wow! Engine parts
I can actually name.

01:16.285 --> 01:18.697
(CHUCKLING) Yeah,
there's no fusion
power cells in this one.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.694
I'm getting it ready
for Founders' Day.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.030
Ah, right!

01:24.042 --> 01:25.031
Right?

01:25.168 --> 01:27.830
Come on, 60th anniversary.
It's gonna be a big party.

01:27.963 --> 01:28.952
Yeah.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.956
No, I'm not
in a party
sort of mood.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.381
Oh, yeah?

01:33.510 --> 01:34.590
Everything okay?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.128
Yeah.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.300
Yeah, no,
Tess and I just...

01:39.433 --> 01:41.549
Oh, no, what happened?

01:41.685 --> 01:43.266
Oh, oh, don't worry.

01:43.395 --> 01:46.979
It's just, I think,
a clogged fuel filter.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.521
Well, it's no wonder.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.481
It's been sitting
in the museum
for the last decade.

01:50.611 --> 01:51.817
Well, you can't
have Founders' Day

01:51.945 --> 01:53.981
without the founder's car,
so I'll give you a hand.

01:54.823 --> 01:55.858
Great.

01:55.991 --> 01:59.575
Uh, Sheriff Jack Carter,
this is, uh... I'm sorry.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.489
Grace Monroe.
Grace Monroe.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.824
l was volunteered
to organize Founders' Day.

02:03.957 --> 02:04.821
That's a big job.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.823
Oh, you have
no idea, Sheriff.
(PHONE RINGING)

02:06.960 --> 02:08.666
Oh, think I might...
Oh, yeah?

02:10.714 --> 02:11.624
Allison.

02:11.757 --> 02:13.713
Yeah, sure.
So we'll talk later.
Yeah, yeah.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.006
Hey!

02:15.135 --> 02:16.466
All right,
so the filter's
down there.

02:16.595 --> 02:17.584
Yeah...

(BABY COOING)

02:19.973 --> 02:21.179

what's up?

02:21.308 --> 02:23.390
Oh, my blood pressure.

02:23.518 --> 02:24.507
(CHUCKLES)

02:24.686 --> 02:25.846
I need you to help
me with logistics

02:25.979 --> 02:27.935
or Founders' Day
is going to be
the end of me.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.430
Yeah?
I'm starting
to see why.

02:29.608 --> 02:30.848
Yeah, all this
plus we're testing

02:30.984 --> 02:32.849
dozens of projects
at Global Dynamics.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.851
Kevin started with
a new rec therapist,

02:34.988 --> 02:38.151
and Jenna,
she still hasn't slept
through the whole night.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.194

Mama's brain, aren't you?

in charge of the most
dangerous minds
in the world.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.576
It's a scientific
think tank, Carter,

02:46.708 --> 02:47.823
not an insane asylum.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.119
Yeah, tomato,
tom-ahto.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.379
Hey, guys.
Cold War Cappuccino?

02:51.588 --> 02:52.623
No, no, thank you.
No thanks.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.041
Okay.
Thanks.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.833
So I heard about Tess.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.844
Oh, come on,
that just happened.
That just happened!

03:00.972 --> 03:03.133
I know.
I called the house
to talk to you,

03:03.266 --> 03:05.973
and SARAH answered.
I'm sorry.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.134
Thanks.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.728
You okay?
Uh... Yeah.

03:11.024 --> 03:13.060
Yeah, I mean,
Zoe's coming home
from Harvard after finals,

03:13.193 --> 03:15.024
and the house
has been really quiet,
so that'll be great.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.142
Oh, well,
if you need noise,

03:16.279 --> 03:17.735
you can always
come to my house.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.695
I'd be happy
to take the kids
if you need a break.

03:19.825 --> 03:20.905
No, no, no,
that's okay.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.821
I actually,
finally found a nanny.

03:24.621 --> 03:25.952
A nanny?
Mmm-hmm.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.246
A nanny?
What has a nanny got...

03:28.375 --> 03:30.491
What has a nanny got
that I don't have?

03:30.627 --> 03:32.834
Like a PhD in early
childhood development

03:32.963 --> 03:34.954
with an emphasis
on organic nutrition?

03:35.674 --> 03:36.754
Lightweight.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.794
Yeah, even Kevin
seems to like the guy,

03:38.927 --> 03:40.667
which is unusual
with autism.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.546
He's usually more comfortable
with technology than people.

03:43.682 --> 03:45.843
Hey, baby,
how you doing?
You working hard?

03:46.226 --> 03:47.386
He sure is.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.055
These classics
aren't gonna
reassemble themselves.

03:49.354 --> 03:50.969
Nice 'stache!

03:51.148 --> 03:53.013
Thanks. Just showing
my town spirit, Sheriff.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.521
Founders' Day celebrates
Albert Einstein's vision,

03:56.653 --> 03:59.395
of building a haven
for the world's
greatest thinkers

03:59.531 --> 04:00.941
to live and create.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.776
Create havoc.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.069
Well, not all the time.

04:04.202 --> 04:07.239
I mean, these early
inventions are a testament
to that vision.

04:08.457 --> 04:09.492
What's this one do?

04:09.624 --> 04:10.955
That's a Van de Graaff
generator,

04:11.960 --> 04:15.373
turned way down in case
someone's crazy enough
to actually touch it.

04:15.964 --> 04:16.953
Look at my arm,
look at my arm!

04:17.090 --> 04:18.330
What... Oh.

04:19.092 --> 04:20.127
How old are you?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.125
All right, I'm gonna take
Jenna back to the house.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.877
Fargo, he's all yours.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.879
Oh, I don't like
the sound of that.

04:26.016 --> 04:28.257
All right,
we're gonna need
some traffic control,

04:28.393 --> 04:30.634
nighttime security
for the science exhibits,

04:30.771 --> 04:36.141
and if you could put
on a '40s-era uniform,
that'd be super.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.145
We strive
for authenticity.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.568
Yeah, can I finish
my run first?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.521
Um, sure.
I'm not unreasonable.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.611
Oh, man,
Cold War Cappuccino.
This is gonna stain.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.695
Same Eureka,
different day.

doing in my cell?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.377
Reminding you
how we first met.

05:02.511 --> 05:03.591
Hmm.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.960

05:05.972 --> 05:07.223
I got you something.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.597
Did you, now?

05:10.101 --> 05:11.181
Hmm.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.013
Huh.

05:13.480 --> 05:17.268
And I suppose you'd like me
to try this on for you?

05:20.946 --> 05:22.356
Something like that.

05:28.245 --> 05:29.485

05:36.127 --> 05:38.709

an honest man of me,

05:38.839 --> 05:40.375

what to say.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.026
No!

(LAUGHING) No!

06:07.409 --> 06:09.491
Well, congratulations.
Congratulations.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.425
Okay? Yeah.
Sure.

06:34.352 --> 06:37.219
If you need anything,
you just call. Okay?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.096
Yeah, I...

07:21.691 --> 07:22.680
Oh!

Sorry, thought you
were Henry Deacon.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.312
No. Dr. Trevor Grant.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.813
Nice to meet you,
Trevor. Nice suit.

07:29.950 --> 07:30.860
You do Eureka proud.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.402
I prefer "Dr. Grant."

07:32.535 --> 07:33.524
And you are?

07:33.662 --> 07:35.823
Already sick
of Founders' Day.

me a lift back into town?

I got some tree
shrinkage to deal with.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.164
Sure, sport.
Climb on in.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.537

this is Red Barber
at Ebbets Field,

where Negro League star,
Jackie Robinson...
(SIGHING) No way.

...is making his Major
League Baseball debut,

07:56.685 --> 07:58.346

battle the Boston Braves...

07:58.478 --> 08:01.094

Founders' Day to
a whole new level.

and Robinson is thrown
out at first base.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.984
Wow! What a career!

08:12.117 --> 08:13.778
He goes
oh for three
in this game,

08:13.910 --> 08:15.696
and then
six months later,
he's rookie of the year.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.036
Amazing.
Changed the face
of baseball.

you wouldn't happen
to have a badge

08:46.943 --> 08:48.808
or a gun, would you?

08:48.987 --> 08:51.353
Yeah. They're
back at my office.

time for this.

for a costume party,

You just assaulted
an officer of the law.

10:28.503 --> 10:29.458
Do you understand that?

10:29.587 --> 10:30.838
Right, because you're
the town sheriff.

10:30.964 --> 10:31.874
Yes.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.595
I need him healthy
enough to stand trial.

10:50.859 --> 10:51.939
Allison,

10:52.443 --> 10:53.819
I'm having
the weirdest dream.

10:53.945 --> 10:54.980
(DOOR CLOSING)

10:55.446 --> 10:56.652
I mean, the uniform's
usually smaller.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.942
Carter, I don't think
this is a dream.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.282
I think it's a dream.

11:02.954 --> 11:03.818
For the handcuffs.

11:03.955 --> 11:04.944
Oh!

11:05.832 --> 11:06.992
This is familiar.

11:08.084 --> 11:08.994
This is good.

11:09.127 --> 11:11.960
Carter, stop messing around.
I need to get you out of here.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.921
(MEN CHATTERING)

11:17.844 --> 11:18.924
He's awake.

11:19.762 --> 11:20.968
You get anything
on him?

11:21.598 --> 11:24.590
He's not in any military
or law enforcement
personnel records.

11:24.726 --> 11:26.091
You figure out
what that thing is?

11:26.936 --> 11:28.187
Beats me.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.011
Maybe a communication device.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.310
I've never seen
technology so advanced.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.526
This is a serious
security breach, Grant.

11:36.654 --> 11:38.190
I'm gonna have
to call the General.

11:38.323 --> 11:39.403
And tell him what?

11:39.532 --> 11:40.692
Telegram for you, sir.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.575
That this
intellectual community

11:44.704 --> 11:46.695
that you're proposing
we build here
has been infiltrated

11:46.831 --> 11:48.116
by a potential spy.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.745
We don't know that, Ryan.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.463
President Truman's

Einstein right now.

MAN ON RADIO: ...in Brooklyn,
where Negro League baseball
star Jackie Robinson

11:58.927 --> 12:01.669
went oh for three
at bat in his first
Major League game...

12:01.804 --> 12:03.340
Did he say Robinson
went oh for three?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.259
Hey, did he say Robinson
went oh for three?

12:05.391 --> 12:06.346
That's right,
Dr. Grant.

12:06.476 --> 12:07.807
Told you he was overrated.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.728
Let's go speak
to our town sheriff.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.908
Where is he?

12:24.744 --> 12:25.824
(SIGHING)

12:25.954 --> 12:26.818
l'll sound the alarm.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.661
No, no.
Don't sound the alarm.

12:29.958 --> 12:30.993
Lock down the base.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.827
We're about to celebrate
the official sanctioning
of this town.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.248
I want this kept quiet.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.588
So secure the base
and find him
without causing a panic,

12:39.842 --> 12:41.924
or the project will
be over before it begins.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.171
Here, try this.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.798
You sure this isn't
some kind of science-
geek-Ren-fair thing?

12:49.185 --> 12:52.348
Well, either we're sharing
the same delusion
or we're stuck in 1947.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.309
Yeah, all right.
So what were you
doing, exactly,

12:55.441 --> 12:56.476
right before you
came back here?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.816
Well, I mean,
after I saw you,

12:58.945 --> 13:01.061
I went back to my car,
and my phone died,

13:01.197 --> 13:03.404
and then I was
in Casablanca.

13:03.658 --> 13:04.693
My phone went dead too.

13:04.826 --> 13:07.067
So? Maybe because
of whatever it was
that sent us here.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.570
Okay, what about
the machine
in the street?

13:10.707 --> 13:11.947
The thing that makes
the hair stand up
on your arm?

13:12.083 --> 13:15.166
No, Van de Graaff devices
are electrostatic
energy generators,

13:15.295 --> 13:16.785
not time machines.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.502
Oh, all right, well,
maybe by themselves.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.794
What happens if you
use it with a...
And you know...

13:23.136 --> 13:24.592
What are you
doing in here?

13:24.929 --> 13:27.090
Uh... Inventory.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.304
(SIGHING)
You and half the base.
Save it for the dance.

13:32.562 --> 13:33.677
Out.

13:33.813 --> 13:34.928
Yeah.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.066
Not exactly Mayberry,
is it?

13:44.198 --> 13:46.109
Well, Eureka started
out as a military base.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.109
The town
wasn't officially
founded until 1950.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.368
Well, how do we get back
to our town and our time?

13:51.497 --> 13:52.828
Well, lwish I knew.
Watch it, watch it.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.117
What?

13:54.625 --> 13:57.992
It's the jackass
who brought me in.
Dr. Grant.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.744
We better not
let him find you.

13:59.922 --> 14:00.786
lfthis is real,

14:00.923 --> 14:03.505
our presence here
could change the course
of future events.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.044
We have to keep
a low profile.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.085

No.

with you bouncing
on his chest like that?

with your patient?

17:50.945 --> 17:51.934

Hey, maybe you should
focus a little less
on the pretty nurse

17:55.616 --> 17:58.028

that we just had
a major security breach.

who these people are.

and then I was
standing, naked,

l froze.

we're in 1947.

how to get back.

turned out to be.

count him out

streaking through the camp.

20:58.716 --> 20:59.956

21:00.092 --> 21:01.798
They're holding him
with Jo, which is a shame,

21:01.927 --> 21:04.543
because he loves swing
and they're having
a dance tonight.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.804
Henry, why are you not
more concerned about this?

21:06.932 --> 21:09.423
I'm very concerned
about this, but we
have the opportunity

21:09.560 --> 21:11.141
to view Eureka
before its founding,

21:11.270 --> 21:13.135
when a few visionaries
changed the future.

21:13.314 --> 21:14.770
Well, until "A,"
we destroy that future,

21:14.899 --> 21:17.766

21:17.902 --> 21:19.893

there is a downside.

21:20.654 --> 21:21.905
Okay, so...

21:23.491 --> 21:24.901
How did we get here?

21:25.910 --> 21:28.401
l was working under
the hood of that Chrysler
with that woman...

21:28.537 --> 21:29.788
Oh, Grace.
Right.

21:29.914 --> 21:32.781
And then my phone rang,
and l was under the hood
of thatjeep.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.249
My phone rang, too,
as did Allison's.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.285
Huh.
They're all fried.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.581
So is mine.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.296
Possibly an
electromagnetic pulse.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.833
But whatever made this
happen would have to put out

21:43.969 --> 21:45.584
a tremendous amount
of negative energy

21:45.721 --> 21:48.588
in order to transfer matter
in a closed timelike curve.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.548
Well, Tess was
saying something

21:50.684 --> 21:53.300
about more solar flares
than they'd seen in decades,

21:53.437 --> 21:55.302
putting out tons
of negative energy,

21:56.273 --> 21:58.980
ironically right before
she broke up with me.
It was...

21:59.693 --> 22:01.479
I know.
I'm sorry, Jack.
Yeah.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.272
But I think she was right.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.535
No, I mean about
the solar flares.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.071
They cycle
every 11 years.

22:10.329 --> 22:13.913
The last peak
of this magnitude was
in the late 1940s.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.911
Well, that's it.

22:16.210 --> 22:17.791
I mean, that can't be
a coincidence, can it?

22:17.920 --> 22:21.333
But, still, it would take
a massive satellite antenna

22:21.465 --> 22:22.671
to harness
that kind of energy,

22:22.800 --> 22:24.461
and satellites haven't
been invented yet.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.676
You sure about that?

22:27.805 --> 22:29.295
Yeah, last time I looked.

22:30.307 --> 22:31.422
Look again.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.599
Okay.

22:39.900 --> 22:42.016
Uh, we need to go
in there. Come on!

22:44.113 --> 22:45.444
Henry.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.030
Hello, again.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.029
Oh, hello.

22:55.165 --> 22:56.701
How's the patient?

22:56.876 --> 23:00.039
Well, it was close,
but I think he's
gonna make it.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.453
You know, I'm more
of a physicist
than physician,

23:02.590 --> 23:05.297
but from where I stood,
you pulled off
a minor miracle.

23:05.926 --> 23:08.042
Sometimes you just
have to improvise.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.840
lmprovise. | see.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.883
So tell me, Allison,

23:12.391 --> 23:13.927
how is it somebody
with your...

23:15.811 --> 23:18.268
Skills is, uh,
is still only a nurse?

23:21.400 --> 23:24.608
So you think nurses
are less valuable
than doctors?

23:25.613 --> 23:27.899
No, ma'am.
Just less appreciated.

23:29.700 --> 23:30.780
Look, we have
a woman in custody.

23:30.910 --> 23:31.945
She needs her
injuries treated.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.568
And there's this naked kid,
needs some clothes.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.870
I would be happy
to take a look.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.921
At the injuries,
not the naked kid.

23:43.339 --> 23:44.795
Glad you clarified that.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.168
(DOOR CLOSES)
Whoo!

23:50.638 --> 23:52.799
You keep searching.
I want him found. Go!

23:52.932 --> 23:53.921
Yes, sir.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.389
Major Ryan.

23:55.517 --> 23:57.678
I just found these
hidden in the supply room.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.264
And this.

24:07.154 --> 24:09.190
(SIGHS)
Wow!

24:10.908 --> 24:12.944
Well, do we know
what we're looking for?

24:16.580 --> 24:18.696
I've seen this
equation before.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.083
Yeah, and I've seen
this before.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.541
This is the machine that
Kevin was fiddling with
on Main Street.

24:22.670 --> 24:23.910
Oh, my God!

24:24.088 --> 24:26.374
Is that good
"Oh, my God,"

24:26.507 --> 24:28.213
or we're screwed
"Oh, my God"?

24:28.342 --> 24:29.707
Well,
if that transmitter's
what I think it is,

24:29.843 --> 24:31.549
then Kevin must have
created a link,

24:31.679 --> 24:33.385
a network between
us and the machine.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.224
Could he have used
our cell phones?

24:36.350 --> 24:37.760
Well, they all rang
before we were transported.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.758
They acted like beacons.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.726
Henry, could he have
done this on purpose?

24:43.357 --> 24:44.563
I'm not sure,

24:44.942 --> 24:46.148
but I know who built this.

24:47.653 --> 24:48.893
Hey, sport.

24:49.905 --> 24:53.068
You boys want to tell
me what you're doing
in Dr. Einstein's lab?

25:00.708 --> 25:03.415
Okay, gents,
start talking.

25:03.544 --> 25:04.829
Make it snappy.

25:05.796 --> 25:08.708
Okay.
You remember me,
uh, Jack Carter,

25:09.299 --> 25:10.709
first-time caller,
longtime fan.

25:12.594 --> 25:13.754
(ZIPPO CLICKING)

25:13.887 --> 25:15.388
Henry Deacon,
Dr. Grant.

25:16.473 --> 25:17.679
(STUTTERING) Wait...

25:18.892 --> 25:20.348
Trevor Grant?

25:20.477 --> 25:21.762
Uh, Deacon,
he prefers "Doctor."

25:21.895 --> 25:23.146
He's kind of
sensitive about it.

25:23.272 --> 25:24.762
Do I know you?
HENRY: No, but I know you.

25:24.898 --> 25:26.684
I mean, Einstein
got all the press,

25:26.817 --> 25:28.523
but your work is critical
to how we understand

25:28.652 --> 25:30.734
21 st century
theoretical physics.

25:32.906 --> 25:36.148
Did you say my work
and 21st century?

25:36.285 --> 25:38.992
We're not
from around here.
Well, not yet anyway.

25:39.621 --> 25:42.328
Einstein proposed that
two points in time-space

25:42.458 --> 25:44.699
could be bridged with
a Lorentzian wormhole.
Wormhole.

25:44.835 --> 25:48.919
Well, you helped build
the Einstein-Grant Bridge
to test the theory.

25:50.007 --> 25:51.167
What, that?

25:51.300 --> 25:53.086
We've been working
on it for years.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.839
I've gotten close,
but I've never been
able to harness enough

25:55.971 --> 25:57.472
of the sun's energy
to make it work.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.592
Well, maybe energy
wasn't your problem.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.966
Jack, you saw Kevin
with this same machine
on Main Street.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.512
Maybe half an hour
before we arrived.

26:03.645 --> 26:05.476
If he activated
it in 2010,

26:05.606 --> 26:06.641
with the solar flares
we were seeing,

26:06.774 --> 26:10.608
then maybe the machines
created a link
between the two times.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.769
Until then,
you were building
a bridge to nowhere.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.520
We built the other side.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.066
Do you seriously
expect me to believe

26:16.200 --> 26:17.235
that you're from
the future?

26:17.367 --> 26:18.402
I think you already believe,

26:18.535 --> 26:20.150
othenNise you would have
called the MPs by now.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.081
That strange naked kid,

26:26.710 --> 26:29.417
that terrifying woman,
they're with you.

26:29.546 --> 26:30.501
Fargo.

26:30.631 --> 26:31.666
That was Fargo
and Jo Lupo, yes.

26:31.799 --> 26:33.630
And the nurse
with the unorthodox
training

26:33.759 --> 26:34.748
and the amazing gams.

26:34.885 --> 26:37.217
Oh, easy on the gams.
Allison, yes?

26:37.346 --> 26:38.506
Yeah, whatever.

26:38.639 --> 26:39.628
You're all together.

26:39.765 --> 26:42.131
Well, we're all
from the Eureka
that you help create.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.007
Now we need your help
to get us back.

26:44.603 --> 26:47.140
(LAUGHS) rrr can.

26:48.065 --> 26:50.056
The device is powered
by solar flares.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.892
Satellite goes into eclipse
just after 11:00 pm.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.734
After that,
bridge closed,

26:54.863 --> 26:55.898
ain't nobody
going nowhere.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.146
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

26:57.574 --> 26:59.951
Dr. Grant,
it's Major Ryan.
Open the door.

27:00.077 --> 27:01.783
Because that's
exactly the kind
of day I'm having...

27:01.912 --> 27:04.494
Hide. l'mjust
on the phone with, uh,

27:05.332 --> 27:06.742
Professor Einstein.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.035
(POUNDING CONTINUES)

27:09.920 --> 27:12.536
I thought I said
conduct the search
quietly.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.584
Dr. Grant, we may
have another spy.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.581
I found these and this.

27:19.596 --> 27:22.713
That means we have
two in custody
and another two on base.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.598
Any idea who
these belong to?

27:25.727 --> 27:27.308
I'm narrowing the search.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.149
Listen to me, Ryan,

27:31.900 --> 27:34.391
I'm not entirely convinced
these people are spies.

27:35.404 --> 27:36.439
Really?
Really.

27:36.572 --> 27:37.778
lam.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.113
I'm gonna find them,
prosecute them

27:40.242 --> 27:42.608
and anyone who attempts
to protect them.

27:59.887 --> 28:02.094
Dr. Grant asked me
to check her injuries.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.723
Can you open
the cell, please?

28:06.894 --> 28:08.600
You can treat her
through the bars.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.390
She's surprisingly strong.

28:13.275 --> 28:14.606
She'll need to disrobe.

28:14.735 --> 28:16.726
Can we get some
privacy, please?

28:19.239 --> 28:21.195
Sure. I could use
a smoke anyway.

28:26.246 --> 28:27.452
Are you guys okay?

28:27.581 --> 28:28.570
Do we look okay?

28:28.707 --> 28:29.867
Well, I brought
you some clothes.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.410
Thank God!
Thank God!

28:31.877 --> 28:33.242
Henry and Carter
are here, too.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.585
They went into
the concrete bunker
under the dish.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.750
Here. We're gonna get
you guys outta here.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.669
What's that?
Magnesium powder
from the fireworks

28:39.801 --> 28:41.177
for the big
swing dance on base.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.929
Really?
I love swing dancing.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.420
Fargo, focus.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.342
The powder should
burn hot enough
to melt the lock.

28:46.475 --> 28:47.885
What about the MP?

28:48.393 --> 28:50.224
I'll distract him
for as long as I can.

28:56.777 --> 28:57.766
All finished.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.894
So...
Going to the dance?

29:06.119 --> 29:07.734
Okay, the lock is packed.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.372
Try not to burn
the place down.

29:15.963 --> 29:18.500
That's it?
This is gonna
take forever.

29:18.632 --> 29:20.247
Can't we blow on
it or something?

29:20.384 --> 29:22.500
No, but if we spray
it with water,

29:22.636 --> 29:25.753
the hydrogen and oxygen
atoms will split
and intensify the heat.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.096
Yeah, well, we're in jail.
Where are we supposed
to get water from?

29:28.225 --> 29:29.886
Well, from us.

29:31.144 --> 29:33.977
Tell me you are
not suggesting that
l pee on the flame.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.807
Fine, I'll do it,
but turn around.

29:37.943 --> 29:39.649
I can't go
if you're watching.

29:39.861 --> 29:40.850
Hmm.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.228
My hero.

29:51.373 --> 29:54.661

Oh, sparks! So hot!

29:56.628 --> 29:57.834
(FARGO EXCLAIMING)

29:57.963 --> 29:58.952
You hear that?

29:59.089 --> 30:00.545
It must be the dance.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.751
Well, the batteries
are dead,

30:06.888 --> 30:08.844
but the computer chips
are still good.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.178
This technology
is astonishing.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.892
It's just astonishing.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.770
We've been developing
prototype transistors

30:16.898 --> 30:19.184
for satellite
communications.
Where are they?

30:19.484 --> 30:20.860
Yes, yes.

30:21.695 --> 30:23.936
We may be able
to adapt these
to the telephones.

30:24.072 --> 30:25.232
If we set them
to the same frequency

30:25.365 --> 30:27.105
as the bridge device,
we can set up a network.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.285
A network.
Yes, exactly.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.527
So did you really set
a satellite in orbit,

30:31.663 --> 30:32.903
a decade before
the world knew?

30:33.040 --> 30:34.496
Oh, yes, we did.

30:34.624 --> 30:35.750
It wasn't even that hard.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.457
Wow, you rule,

30:37.586 --> 30:38.826
but we still have
a big problem.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.543
I got three
people out there,

30:40.672 --> 30:41.752

are in here.

Okay, listen, Sheriff.

30:49.556 --> 30:50.762
Yeah?

10 degrees to the south.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.016

where do | go?

30:58.023 --> 30:59.263

scrapes and bruises.

31:08.867 --> 31:09.982
She's getting dressed now.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.858
Just give her
a few minutes.
Good, good.

31:11.995 --> 31:13.860
Actually, I came
here to see you.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.910
A token
of my appreciation
for all your help.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.748
Thought maybe you could
wear them at the dance.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.042
Thank you, sir,
but that's not necessary.

31:29.721 --> 31:30.881
Where is he?

31:31.598 --> 31:32.883
"He" who?

31:33.392 --> 31:36.225
The guy the clerk saw you
with in the supply closet,

31:37.062 --> 31:38.598
where she found these.

33:07.152 --> 33:08.358
Well, I've got
two ready, I hope.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.852
Great. You hope?

33:10.155 --> 33:12.146
You'll never reach her
without getting caught.
I'll go with you.

33:12.282 --> 33:13.738
Wait, I can't do
the others alone.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.573
Well, I can't help.
I've gotta help him.

33:15.827 --> 33:16.907
Well, maybe
we can help.

33:17.037 --> 33:18.402
Fargo,
why are you on fire?

33:18.538 --> 33:19.994
(SIGHING) I'd rather
not talk about it.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.078
He stepped up.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.540
Allison helped us out.
She said she saw you
headed this way.

33:23.668 --> 33:24.748
Yeah, Ryan got her.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.243
Jo, I need you
to guard the lab,

33:26.379 --> 33:27.755
make sure Henry
and Fargo can work.

33:27.881 --> 33:28.961
Done.
All right.

33:29.382 --> 33:32.294
And you're all
from 2010?

33:32.427 --> 33:33.758
Yeah.
Who's this guy?

33:33.887 --> 33:34.751
Dr. Trevor Grant.

33:34.888 --> 33:35.798
The Trevor Grant?

33:35.931 --> 33:36.886
Yes, I am, actually.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.004
(WHISTLING) We gotta go!

33:38.141 --> 33:40.097
Yes. We'll get to Allison
as quickly as we can,

33:40.227 --> 33:42.969
but Henry, you have to
turn on the beacons
before 11:00 pm,

33:43.104 --> 33:44.093
or you'll all
be stranded here.

33:44.231 --> 33:45.471
Got it.
I wish I was
coming with you.

33:45.857 --> 33:46.972
It's a real pleasure
to meet you, Dr. Deacon.

33:47.108 --> 33:48.484
No, the honor
is mine, Dr. Grant.

33:48.693 --> 33:49.899
Don't break that.
That would suck.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.564
Suck what?
Uh, forget it.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.329
Here.
What?

34:00.455 --> 34:02.286
Better take my jacket.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.666
Here?

34:09.881 --> 34:10.961
Thanks.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.334
I hardly recognize
you, sport.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.049
Seriously,

34:19.558 --> 34:21.389
don't call me "sport."

34:21.893 --> 34:22.757
Where are they?

34:22.894 --> 34:24.600
I told you,
I don't know.

34:24.854 --> 34:27.846
That's convenient that
they managed to escape
right after you were here.

34:28.191 --> 34:29.727
Well, not so
convenient for me.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.395
Oh, you think
this is funny.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.602
Well, I think
she's funny.

34:34.197 --> 34:35.937
And easy on the eyes.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.531
And one
hell of a nurse.

34:39.869 --> 34:41.405
What are you doing
here, Grant?

34:41.955 --> 34:43.570
Looking for someone
to dance with,

34:44.541 --> 34:45.872
and you're not my type.

34:46.293 --> 34:47.749
Shall we, darling?

34:47.877 --> 34:49.083
Uh...

34:49.504 --> 34:50.539
Hey.

34:50.672 --> 34:51.752
You didn't really
think I'd just let you

34:51.881 --> 34:53.382
walk out of here
with her, did you?

34:54.926 --> 34:58.043
I did.
You know, I did,
but he didn't.

34:58.763 --> 34:59.798
Who?

35:04.394 --> 35:05.474
Him.

35:06.980 --> 35:07.969
Told you I'd be back.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.346
Carter.

35:10.525 --> 35:11.765
(CHUCKLES)

35:14.863 --> 35:16.945
Here, take this.
What is it?

35:17.073 --> 35:18.324
It's your ticket
home, sweetheart,

35:18.450 --> 35:19.360
if they don't
catch us first.

35:19.492 --> 35:20.868
Uh, I think
we got trouble.

35:22.037 --> 35:24.028
Henry needs time
to finish the beacons.

35:26.666 --> 35:27.746
Quick, in there.

35:27.876 --> 35:28.740
It's easier
to hide in a crowd.

35:28.877 --> 35:30.208
I'll try to buy you
some time. Go!

35:30.337 --> 35:31.417
Okay. Thank you
for your help.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.207
Don't thank me yet,
doll. Go, go!

35:33.340 --> 35:34.750
(CHATTERING OVER PA)

35:36.676 --> 35:37.882
(SWING MUSIC PLAYING)

35:47.854 --> 35:49.719
What now?
Now we dance.

35:50.774 --> 35:51.854
You dance?

35:51.983 --> 35:53.314
I know some stuff.

35:55.862 --> 35:56.851
Come on, Henry.

36:06.956 --> 36:07.945
(MUSIC STOPS)

36:12.671 --> 36:14.161
Almost there.

36:14.881 --> 36:16.462
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

36:25.350 --> 36:26.806
(SINGING)

36:29.062 --> 36:30.222
Oh...

36:31.731 --> 36:32.846
Can I have this dance?

36:41.825 --> 36:42.860
Anytime, Henry.

36:44.869 --> 36:45.949
Oh!

37:01.761 --> 37:02.841
It's time.

37:11.104 --> 37:12.059
Here we go.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.724
Okay, uh, do you
have your phone?

37:13.857 --> 37:16.519
Ah! I left it
in the otherjacket.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.857
You what?

37:20.530 --> 37:22.111
Go, go.
No, no way.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.741
You have Kevin
and the baby.
And you have Zoe.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.027
We don't have
time to argue.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.321
You know what?
Maybe we don't
have to argue.

37:27.495 --> 37:28.746
Hold my hands.

37:28.872 --> 37:30.863
Hold your hands?
Hold my hands!

37:33.501 --> 37:35.332
Look, I would rather us
be stuck here together

37:35.462 --> 37:37.168
than leave either
one of us alone.

37:41.384 --> 37:42.624
(SINGING CONTINUES)

37:45.764 --> 37:46.844
Just for luck.

38:34.646 --> 38:35.852
ALLISON: Carter!

38:40.610 --> 38:41.975
Sorry, sorry.

38:42.570 --> 38:43.605
Allison!

38:43.738 --> 38:44.727
(PANTING)

38:44.864 --> 38:46.195
Hey, hey.

38:51.704 --> 38:53.285
You okay?
I think so.

38:53.873 --> 38:54.953
How'd you know
that was gonna work?

38:55.083 --> 38:56.289
(LAUGHING) I didn't.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.578
You... Well,
thanks for keeping
that to yourself.

38:59.254 --> 39:00.960
Thanks for the
"Just for luck."

39:02.799 --> 39:03.834
(SIGHING)

39:05.844 --> 39:06.959
Hey!

39:07.720 --> 39:08.709
Everybody's here.
You okay?

39:08.847 --> 39:10.587
Yeah. Can't believe it.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.463
(ALL LAUGHING)
Thanks for getting
us home, Henry.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.589
Couldn't have done
it without you.

39:13.726 --> 39:16.388
Hey, hey, guys!
Great costumes.

39:16.521 --> 39:17.886
(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

39:18.857 --> 39:20.563
I never thought
I'd be relieved
to see Founders' Day.

39:20.692 --> 39:21.727
Mmm-hmm.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.316
And somehow everything
is just the same.

39:23.611 --> 39:24.600
Yeah.

39:24.737 --> 39:26.602
Uh, almost everything.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.824
Archimedes used
to be granite.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.413
CARTER: That isn't granite.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.241
ALLISON: That's bronze.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.412
Okay, wait,
if that's different,

39:40.545 --> 39:41.955
other stuff could
be too, right?

39:42.213 --> 39:43.248
Right.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.791
I gotta get home.
Okay.

39:52.515 --> 39:53.630
Zane.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.472
I can't believe
you're still here.

39:56.269 --> 39:57.975
Where else would I be?

39:58.104 --> 40:00.311
I thought
after the way
that l reacted...

40:01.149 --> 40:02.514
(SIGHING)

40:03.067 --> 40:04.182
I'm sorry.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.567
I don't know
what I was thinking.

40:06.863 --> 40:08.728
Maybe I was just
thinking too much.

40:08.865 --> 40:11.231
You know, I...
I do that
sometimes and...

40:11.367 --> 40:13.653
Lupo, what the hell
are you trying to say?

40:16.164 --> 40:17.870
I'm trying to say, "Yes."

40:22.211 --> 40:23.337
Yes?

40:24.130 --> 40:25.245
Yeah.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.672
You'll ask Carter to let
me off for good behavior?

40:30.845 --> 40:32.176
No, l...

40:32.805 --> 40:34.841
Yes, lwill marry you.

40:37.769 --> 40:41.182
(LAUGHING)
Me marry you?

40:41.314 --> 40:42.474
Mmm-hmm.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.559
In what universe?

41:14.973 --> 41:16.554

Yeah.
Hmm. Okay.

Where are you? Kevin!

Uh, where's your sister?

41:51.843 --> 41:53.049
The nanny is
giving her a bottle.

41:53.469 --> 41:57.212
I'm going to Dre's house.
He asked me to play Xbox,
and I finished my homework.

41:57.348 --> 41:59.054
So can I go?

41:59.183 --> 42:00.138
What?

42:00.268 --> 42:02.725
Xbox, Dre's house, me.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.182
(CLICKING TONGUE)
I'll be home before dinner.

42:05.314 --> 42:06.690

still at Harvard?

42:28.713 --> 42:31.250
Of course she is, Jack.
Where else would she be?

never get here.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.263
Yeah, me neither.

42:46.022 --> 42:47.228
Can I get you a drink?

Hi, wow, nice clothes.
Vintage?

43:06.834 --> 43:08.210
Yeah, you might
say that.

43:08.336 --> 43:09.451
I wonder if you
could help me out.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.953
I'm looking
for Allison Blake.
