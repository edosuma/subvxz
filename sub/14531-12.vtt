WEBVTT

00:44.508 --> 00:48.262
Day seven of moving on from Sol.

00:48.345 --> 00:53.684
I'm going it alone. I'm not
responding to texts, emails, or calls.

00:53.768 --> 00:57.605
Today he sent me a
photo of a Corgi wedding,

00:57.688 --> 00:59.356
but I did not write back.

00:59.440 --> 01:04.028
In truth, I had to suppress a
powerful urge to text him back

01:04.111 --> 01:08.574
that Corgis are the preferred mode of
transportation for woodland faeries,

01:08.658 --> 01:13.245
so I practiced my laughter yoga
which I will demonstrate now.

01:13.329 --> 01:16.290
Ho ho. Ha ha ha.

01:16.373 --> 01:18.793
I gained another pound today,

01:18.876 --> 01:21.629
but I think it's a pound of knowledge.

01:21.712 --> 01:25.257
Ho ho ho, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

01:25.341 --> 01:28.052
I'm now ready for today's big step.

01:28.135 --> 01:32.222
It will be hard, and I should
have a nurturing friend nearby,

01:32.306 --> 01:35.018
but Grace, of course, is out with Guy.

01:35.100 --> 01:38.354
This is the unbroken circle,

01:38.437 --> 01:42.525
or the thing that has no beginning and
no end, or some other shit like that,

01:42.608 --> 01:47.237
but today its life on my
finger is coming to an end.

01:56.706 --> 01:59.042
Finger, there, be free. Be free.

01:59.124 --> 02:00.835
- Be free.
- [cell phone ringing]

02:00.918 --> 02:03.796
Excuse me, you're ringing. I must get you.

02:03.880 --> 02:05.882
- Hi, honey.
- Sorry I haven't called back.

02:05.965 --> 02:09.092
It's been really crazy. And
double sorry, I only have a minute.

02:09.175 --> 02:12.930
Pull out your Beatle wig. The
Fab Faux are in town Saturday.

02:13.014 --> 02:17.727
- I know how you love their Ringo.
- Aw, you're killin' me, Mom. I can't.

02:17.810 --> 02:20.771
- We're throwing Dad's bachelor party.
- Oh, right.

02:20.855 --> 02:22.356
- [knock on door]
- I'm really sorry, Mom,

02:22.439 --> 02:23.440
and I'll make it up to you

02:23.524 --> 02:25.943
next time Candace Joplin is
in town, but I have to go.

02:26.027 --> 02:28.779
I have to go, too. I'm
having a party right now.

02:28.863 --> 02:31.032
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll be
right there with the dip.

02:31.115 --> 02:33.534
Where's Kevin? Hey, Kevin!

02:33.617 --> 02:35.369
- [laughs]
- [phone beeps]

02:39.415 --> 02:40.541
[sighs]

02:44.879 --> 02:48.173
Last time we came here for brunch,
you basically threw a bagel at us.

02:48.257 --> 02:52.053
Today there's pumpkin pancakes
and syrup in pitchers. What's up?

02:52.136 --> 02:54.179
What? We're officially a family now.

02:54.263 --> 02:57.224
Yeah. We just want our sisters
to enjoy a nice breakfast.

02:57.307 --> 02:58.392
What do you want?

02:58.475 --> 03:03.647
What we want is for you
to eat and enjoy and...

03:03.731 --> 03:06.358
- Help us throw our dads' bachelor party.
- Ah.

03:06.442 --> 03:09.236
Well, first of all, isn't
that more of a best man thing?

03:09.319 --> 03:11.655
We're having a little trouble
realizing their vision.

03:11.739 --> 03:13.240
They want classy and elegant,

03:13.323 --> 03:16.077
turns out we don't know as
much about that as we thought.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.788
To be fair, we never
thought we knew that much.

03:18.871 --> 03:21.290
It's a bachelor party, it's not
supposed to be classy and elegant.

03:21.373 --> 03:22.833
It's supposed to be crass and tacky.

03:22.917 --> 03:25.086
- That's what I said!
- It's not what they want.

03:25.169 --> 03:28.589
So we're going to give them classy
and elegant... with your help.

03:28.672 --> 03:32.217
It's easy. We have one signature
cocktail, three passed appetizers,

03:32.301 --> 03:34.386
prosciutto-wrapped
asparagus, turkey meatballs,

03:34.470 --> 03:36.722
maybe those little tea cups
with the matzo ball soup.

03:36.806 --> 03:39.725
That's two references to balls.
They'll think we're making a joke.

03:39.809 --> 03:41.602
- When is this party again?
- Saturday.

03:41.685 --> 03:45.481
Ah, are you fucking insane? We can't
throw a party in less than a week.

03:45.564 --> 03:47.441
- We can't do it!
- Martha... Martha...

03:47.524 --> 03:50.153
It's gonna be okay. Guys,
you can't do this to her,

03:50.235 --> 03:54.490
and first of all, I think you do
want to make a joke about balls.

03:54.573 --> 03:56.826
I mean, it's a bachelor
party, but they're gay men,

03:56.909 --> 04:01.831
so it should be like a wild
bachelorette thing with penises and balls

04:01.914 --> 04:05.250
and party games where you're
pinning penises onto balls.

04:05.334 --> 04:07.336
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!
- But we can't do that.

04:07.419 --> 04:09.713
They said they wanted a party
that reflects who they are.

04:09.797 --> 04:12.382
Of course, they could have told
us that before I sent out the Evite

04:12.466 --> 04:13.926
with a cowboy in assless chaps.

04:14.010 --> 04:16.512
- See, now that's a party I will go to.
- We will help you.

04:16.595 --> 04:19.182
- I am so busy.
- I will help you.

04:19.264 --> 04:20.099
Thank you.

04:20.183 --> 04:21.433
But first we need to make a list.

04:21.517 --> 04:24.228
Before that we need to make a list
of all the lists that we need to make.

04:24.311 --> 04:26.605
- I'm gonna put us all in a group text.
- Can I just say,

04:26.689 --> 04:28.816
this is a fairly elegant spread.

04:28.899 --> 04:31.110
Yeah, well, we paid our
neighbor to cook it for us.

04:31.194 --> 04:32.611
You may want to look out for cat hair.

04:32.695 --> 04:35.364
- Got a piece on it right there, actually.
- Oh, God! Get it.

04:46.167 --> 04:49.003
- What are your plans for tonight?
- Oh, not much.

04:49.086 --> 04:52.840
I thought about crocheting myself a noose,

04:52.923 --> 04:55.634
but I can't decide on purple or pink.

04:55.718 --> 04:57.302
So you're not feeling better.

04:57.386 --> 05:01.306
No, I was coming out of my
psycho-physical Sol withdrawal,

05:01.390 --> 05:04.101
- but then with tonight...
- Is this about the bachelor party?

05:04.185 --> 05:06.812
No. I'm happy those fuckers
are gonna have a good time.

05:06.896 --> 05:10.107
Oh... I hate seeing you like this.

05:10.191 --> 05:14.195
- Then go out.
- No. Come on. Let's do something fun.

05:14.278 --> 05:19.366
No, no. Don't worry about me. Just go
pick up Guy at the airport or something.

05:19.449 --> 05:22.870
He's a grown man. I'll
tell him to take a cab home.

05:22.953 --> 05:25.539
You are in need of some
serious cheering up.

05:25.622 --> 05:28.625
I'm not without cheer. I'm a little down.

05:28.709 --> 05:32.504
It's an honest down,
and since you're so up,

05:32.588 --> 05:34.715
there's a homeostatic balance.

05:34.798 --> 05:36.717
Come on, Frankie, what do you want to do?

05:36.800 --> 05:39.553
- I don't know. Nap.
- [chuckles]

05:39.636 --> 05:41.513
Tweet a sad haiku.

05:41.597 --> 05:44.808
You like to liberate the lobsters
from the tank at the Food Giant.

05:44.892 --> 05:48.520
Ah, the fish guy knows me. My
picture's next to the shrimp.

05:48.604 --> 05:51.065
Okay. You want to go to the art
museum and touch the paintings?

05:51.148 --> 05:55.611
- I did that last week.
- I'll do anything. I'll drink beer!

05:55.694 --> 05:57.446
- I'll wear a hat!
- A funny hat?

05:57.529 --> 06:01.867
- A funny hat.
- I always like a good say yes night.

06:01.951 --> 06:03.410
Remind me again what that is.

06:03.493 --> 06:07.748
You go out and you say "yes"
to everything, all night.

06:07.831 --> 06:10.459
There's no "no" until it's over.

06:10.542 --> 06:12.086
Sounds lengthy.

06:13.420 --> 06:16.506
You know, say yes takes you
places you've never been.

06:16.590 --> 06:20.719
One time Sol and I ended up
buying a Del Taco franchise.

06:20.803 --> 06:21.845
How did that happen?

06:21.929 --> 06:25.182
A guy asked us, "Do you want
to buy a Del Taco franchise?"

06:25.266 --> 06:27.559
- [laughs]
- We had to say yes. [laughs]

06:27.643 --> 06:29.645
Well, we'll stay away from that guy.

06:29.728 --> 06:32.189
You know, just thinking about
it cheers me up a little bit.

06:32.273 --> 06:34.650
- There you go.
- Let's do it.

06:34.733 --> 06:36.068
All right!

06:36.152 --> 06:39.404
? And the spear goes through the
meatball Till it hits the plate ?

06:39.488 --> 06:43.408
? And you don't eat the meatballs Coyote ?

06:43.492 --> 06:45.328
- Good boy.
- These Soljitos are great,

06:45.410 --> 06:48.080
but those Robertritas... Satan's work.

06:48.164 --> 06:50.374
Mm, the secret is the jalapeÃ±o tequila.

06:50.457 --> 06:53.169
Okay. Don't pour too many.
These are presentational.

06:53.252 --> 06:55.504
We can serve the real
ones when people get here.

06:55.587 --> 06:58.215
- [doorbell rings]
- What the fuck?! Someone's here?

06:58.299 --> 07:01.051
Seriously... you've got
to bring it way down.

07:01.135 --> 07:02.845
- [sighs]
- [Robert] I'll get it!

07:04.972 --> 07:08.267
No, I wanna get it. I love parties!

07:09.768 --> 07:11.103
- Nelson.
- Nelson!

07:11.187 --> 07:13.272
- Nelson?
- I can't believe it.

07:13.356 --> 07:16.775
You came all the way from
Utah. I am so tickled!

07:16.859 --> 07:18.819
You know me, Robert. I like a good party.

07:18.902 --> 07:21.071
[chuckling]

07:21.155 --> 07:23.782
Well, you're welcome. Let me take
your coat. Can I get you a drink?

07:23.866 --> 07:25.326
- A scotch would be great.
- Okay.

07:25.409 --> 07:28.037
Actually, we have Soljitos and Robertritas,

07:28.120 --> 07:32.249
but those are just presentational.
Come, I'll make you a new one.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.918
Follow that handsome young man.

07:35.002 --> 07:36.586
And you're welcome.

07:36.670 --> 07:39.715
Why is Nelson Queller here? He
wasn't on the list we gave the boys.

07:39.798 --> 07:43.468
Well, I know, but we were emailing,
and I felt bad, so I invited him.

07:43.552 --> 07:45.637
Look, I didn't think he would even come.

07:45.721 --> 07:48.891
- You know how I feel about that man.
- All right, but he's been good to us.

07:48.974 --> 07:51.101
Remember, he took us
under his wing at the firm.

07:51.185 --> 07:52.561
No. He took you under his wing.

07:52.644 --> 07:56.815
He still thinks I'm the hippie Jew with
the black son and the communist wife.

07:56.899 --> 07:58.901
What about your
drug-addict son... Nothing?

07:58.984 --> 08:01.737
- Ha.
- Look, Nelson's not a bad guy.

08:01.820 --> 08:04.114
I mean, didn't he come
all this way just for us?

08:04.198 --> 08:05.991
He's not the person you think.

08:06.075 --> 08:10.329
Wait a minute. Is Nelson why you
didn't want any ribaldry tonight?

08:10.413 --> 08:12.373
We both didn't want it. It's not our style.

08:12.456 --> 08:14.833
No, it's not, but with Nelson coming,

08:14.917 --> 08:17.461
it's a good thing our
party is squeaky clean.

08:17.544 --> 08:19.255
- What's your point?
- My point is

08:19.338 --> 08:22.341
I'm suddenly in the
mood for a penis balloon.

08:22.425 --> 08:25.052
No. You're just saying that
because you can't have one.

08:25.135 --> 08:26.845
[laughs]

08:26.929 --> 08:28.764
Maybe you're right.

08:28.847 --> 08:32.226
It's our party, and
nothing's going to bother me.

08:32.308 --> 08:36.145
I have a drink named after
me. I'm going to get a Soljito.

08:36.230 --> 08:38.565
I have one named after me, as well.

08:38.648 --> 08:40.817
Why does Nelson think
that I am a drug addict?

08:40.900 --> 08:45.364
Can you go explain to him that you
are the addict and I am the black one?

08:46.323 --> 08:49.576
All right, guys. My work here is done.
You guys are set for a great party.

08:49.659 --> 08:50.869
- What?
- You're not leaving!

08:50.953 --> 08:53.830
We don't know anything about
hosting a party like this.

08:53.914 --> 08:56.417
Yeah, we're no classier
than we were five days ago.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.795
You guys, I gotta go. My
actual children need me, okay?

08:59.878 --> 09:02.131
The text chain is still
alive if you need anything.

09:02.214 --> 09:03.632
Bye, Dad. Bye, Uncle Sol.

09:03.715 --> 09:06.009
[Robert] Bye-bye, sweetheart. Thank you.

09:06.093 --> 09:07.094
[sighs]

09:09.554 --> 09:11.640
[Grace] Frankie, are you ready to go out?

09:11.723 --> 09:12.849
Yeah.

09:15.018 --> 09:19.064
- See. This-this is part of the
problem. - What, I shouldn't eat?

09:19.148 --> 09:20.941
No. It's your outfit. Stand up.

09:21.024 --> 09:23.193
Well, there's a few crumbs.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.738
Yeah, turn around. Here's the thing,

09:26.822 --> 09:29.992
you can't start a new life in old clothes.

09:30.075 --> 09:32.953
How am I going to steal the
garnish dispenser from the bar?

09:33.036 --> 09:35.289
[laughs] We've already got two.

09:35.372 --> 09:38.208
You have a waist and hips!

09:38.292 --> 09:42.171
And... Let me just see here now.

09:43.172 --> 09:46.216
And... even breasts!

09:46.300 --> 09:49.052
Look at those girls! Welcome to the world.

09:49.136 --> 09:52.181
- Oh, my Lord, sexy and gorgeous!
- I'm not arguing.

09:52.264 --> 09:55.476
Let me get that beautiful
hair up off your neck,

09:55.559 --> 09:58.854
and oh, Frankie, you've even got cute ears!

09:58.937 --> 10:00.314
- I do?
- Yes!

10:00.397 --> 10:03.608
- Let's go.
- No, you can't go in chip clips.

10:03.692 --> 10:05.735
That's just a demonstration.

10:08.905 --> 10:10.991
- I'm going to dress you tonight.
- Oh, no!

10:11.074 --> 10:14.953
- Oh! You have to say yes.
- Oh, heavens to Betsy and back!

10:15.037 --> 10:16.413
- You're right.
- Yeah.

10:16.497 --> 10:18.499
- Well then, yes.
- Oh, this is going to be fun!

10:18.582 --> 10:22.127
Oh, but if you're gonna
dress me, I'm gonna dress you!

10:22.211 --> 10:24.547
Uh-oh, this is gonna be fun!

10:27.007 --> 10:31.345
- Oh, we look fabulous.
- I feel ridiculous.

10:31.428 --> 10:34.848
Well, I'm going with it. I
love this antigravity bra.

10:34.931 --> 10:38.227
- Cleavage.
- I can't believe I'm not wearing a bra!

10:38.310 --> 10:41.480
- Jiggly, right?
- And a tee shirt at night.

10:41.564 --> 10:43.440
The only thing I hate are these shoes.

10:43.524 --> 10:46.109
- Do you get used to the pain?
- No.

10:46.193 --> 10:47.861
There's the sign.

10:47.944 --> 10:51.407
- This is the place you picked?
- I haven't been here since forever.

10:51.490 --> 10:55.827
It's dark, it's dirty, it's got
urine-soaked sawdust on the floor.

10:55.911 --> 10:57.954
- Ew.
- [sighs]

10:58.038 --> 11:00.832
This is where I got in
my first knife fight.

11:01.542 --> 11:03.544
[dance music playing]

11:11.510 --> 11:14.471
- Oh, nice!
- Oh, no.

11:18.767 --> 11:20.727
[mellow music playing]

11:20.810 --> 11:24.022
Wasn't the Evite for this party
a picture of a cowboy's ass?

11:24.106 --> 11:27.192
You figure there'd be at least one
game of pin the junk on the hunk.

11:27.276 --> 11:30.028
Well, maybe there's going to be a stripper.

11:31.196 --> 11:33.449
Maybe he's already here.

11:33.532 --> 11:35.409
I hope not.

11:43.166 --> 11:44.918
Hey.

11:46.128 --> 11:48.589
Hey, did you guys know that
the Fab Faux are in town?

11:48.672 --> 11:51.967
You ever seen them? It's uncanny!

11:52.050 --> 11:53.260
- No.
- No.

11:53.343 --> 11:55.011
No?

11:57.973 --> 12:01.477
Did you get the annual tote bag
from the California Bar Association?

12:01.560 --> 12:04.146
It's... it's blue this year.

12:04.229 --> 12:06.022
- No.
- No.

12:06.106 --> 12:10.735
I got a "we're sorry we missed
you" slip from the UPS guy.

12:10.819 --> 12:11.903
Maybe it was that.

12:11.987 --> 12:13.780
Maybe.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.949
Should totally follow up.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.372
Did you hear that rain last night?

12:22.456 --> 12:23.957
We had tickets for Barbra Streisand.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.542
So did we.

12:25.626 --> 12:28.378
But this is fun, too.

12:36.512 --> 12:39.682
[laughing] It sounds like retirement
is suiting you just fine, Nelson.

12:39.764 --> 12:43.852
I can't complain. I do,
but I shouldn't. [chuckles]

12:43.935 --> 12:45.688
You have to come to Utah.

12:45.770 --> 12:47.105
We'd love to.

12:47.189 --> 12:48.982
What?

12:49.065 --> 12:51.443
Oh, yeah, sure.

12:52.402 --> 12:56.699
Out on the ranch, it's
mostly skiing and hunting.

12:56.781 --> 12:58.950
I'm not sure if that's your kind of thing.

12:59.034 --> 13:01.161
Oh, no. I love shooting deers in the face.

13:02.204 --> 13:04.206
Deer, dear.

13:04.289 --> 13:07.083
That's what I said, dear.

13:09.336 --> 13:13.423
This is the worst party I've ever
been to, and I was at Jonestown.

13:19.513 --> 13:21.390
Okay. Two things.

13:21.473 --> 13:25.143
This party blows, and did you
know that Charlie was at Jonestown?

13:25.227 --> 13:28.355
Oh, my God, do we have some of that
punch, because this party is awful.

13:28.438 --> 13:30.190
- We've got to do something!
- I know.

13:30.273 --> 13:33.276
- God. Dad looks miserable.
- What do we do? What do we do?

13:33.360 --> 13:35.820
- What do we do?
- I have no idea.

13:35.904 --> 13:42.411
- Maybe if I drink more, I will care less.
- I wouldn't know anything about that.

13:42.494 --> 13:46.289
- I'm gonna have one of these Robertritas.
- That's a Sol... jito.

13:48.124 --> 13:50.919
Doesn't matter. It's workin'.

13:52.128 --> 13:55.507
Hey, Brianna. It's
Coyote. I need your help.

13:55.591 --> 13:58.719
It's Coyote Bergstein. Stop
laughing! That's never funny.

13:58.802 --> 14:01.012
[club music playing]

14:03.682 --> 14:05.768
Doesn't even smell bad.

14:05.850 --> 14:08.103
I know! It's a little noisy, though.

14:08.186 --> 14:09.187
Who's from Boise?

14:10.397 --> 14:12.399
No one. Oh, look!

14:12.482 --> 14:15.235
The bar has those little
hooks for our purses.

14:15.318 --> 14:16.945
Yeah, they must have added them.

14:17.028 --> 14:18.614
Cool outfit.

14:18.697 --> 14:21.199
- Oh, thank you.
- Go away. You're fake.

14:21.283 --> 14:23.619
- You're all fake!
- Frankie.

14:23.702 --> 14:27.330
This place used to be
filled with real dirtbags.

14:27.414 --> 14:29.999
Now it's filled with fake dirtbags.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.753
Look. Look at this artisanal cocktail menu.

14:32.836 --> 14:36.673
I'm feeling really crushed by
the evils of gentrification.

14:36.757 --> 14:42.429
I used to dance on this bar in my
bare feet, periodically topless.

14:42.512 --> 14:45.348
- What's this?
- Two whiskey flights.

14:45.432 --> 14:46.475
We didn't order those.

14:48.644 --> 14:50.729
- Oh, brother.
- Oh, that's so sweet.

14:50.813 --> 14:54.274
- Oh, that's very pretentious.
- Frankie!

14:54.357 --> 14:57.277
But I do like whiskey and
since I have to say yes...

14:57.360 --> 14:59.780
- So, that's a yes?
- That's a yes.

15:09.122 --> 15:11.792
Great. Now they think I
have alien hand syndrome.

15:13.126 --> 15:14.503
It's a thing, look it up!

15:17.046 --> 15:18.590
Come on.

15:22.803 --> 15:25.305
[laughs] There you go!

15:25.388 --> 15:27.015
[pop music playing]

15:31.060 --> 15:34.898
Number three here is definitely
worse than number two.

15:34.981 --> 15:37.693
[laughter]

15:37.776 --> 15:39.361
I'm sorry. Was there a joke in there?

15:39.444 --> 15:40.987
Hey, can I get you guys anything?

15:41.070 --> 15:43.323
- Oh, you again.
- Frankie, are you hungry?

15:43.406 --> 15:46.159
- I am, actually.
- Grace, get the duck sliders.

15:46.242 --> 15:48.871
- They're amazing.
- But it's Frankie that's hungry.

15:48.953 --> 15:50.580
She doesn't eat.

15:50.664 --> 15:55.752
But you must have a few bites
of this deeply fried calamari.

15:55.836 --> 15:58.046
Say yes. Let me hear you say it.

15:58.129 --> 15:59.673
Yes.

15:59.756 --> 16:04.302
Ah, you're going to love the
rabbit stew. Extra rabbit.

16:04.386 --> 16:06.555
- Say yes.
- Yes.

16:06.638 --> 16:08.849
We'll share the duck sliders
and the quail, please.

16:08.932 --> 16:11.810
- Can I get you another flight?
- No, no, no. I'll get her flight.

16:11.894 --> 16:15.230
Guys, guys, please. Don't
fight over getting me nothing.

16:15.313 --> 16:20.819
Full disclosure: I do have a
boyfriend, but Frankie is single.

16:20.903 --> 16:22.612
- Oh, my God.
- Well, good for you.

16:22.696 --> 16:25.866
- Is it serious with this guy?
- It's getting there.

16:25.949 --> 16:29.244
- He told me he loved me.
- Oh, he's a lucky fella.

16:29.327 --> 16:32.288
- Excuse me. Guy told you he loved you?
- That you hear.

16:32.372 --> 16:34.207
- When?
- Last week.

16:34.290 --> 16:35.751
Why didn't you tell me?

16:35.834 --> 16:38.044
You were having a rough time.

16:38.127 --> 16:40.088
So what does that have to do with anything?

16:40.171 --> 16:43.550
- I didn't want to make you feel bad.
- Like not telling me does.

16:48.430 --> 16:52.141
? And the spear goes through the
meatball Till it hits the... plate! ?

16:52.225 --> 16:55.395
? And Coyote is living a nightmare ?

16:55.478 --> 16:57.230
Hey, crazy.

16:57.313 --> 17:00.066
Oh. Thank God you're here.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.402
Wait, where's all the stuff?

17:02.485 --> 17:05.864
I thought you said you were going to save
the party with a bunch of penis stuff.

17:05.948 --> 17:09.200
Boys-a-rama was closed,
but it's all taken care of.

17:09.284 --> 17:11.828
- Oh, okay.
- Look outside.

17:13.371 --> 17:15.373
- What? Look out here?
- Yeah, yeah.

17:15.457 --> 17:17.666
[laughs]

17:22.672 --> 17:24.507
Holy shit!

17:27.301 --> 17:29.429
I think that we may have over-corrected.

17:29.512 --> 17:31.848
No! What? It's great!

17:31.932 --> 17:36.060
It's just like a mechanical
bull, but, you know, a dick.

17:36.144 --> 17:37.145
Yes, I get it.

17:37.228 --> 17:40.565
Okay, well, you talk so slow,
sometimes I think you're dumb.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.568
I'm just worried about...

17:43.652 --> 17:45.612
[Robert] Good God! What
is that on the lawn?

17:45.695 --> 17:47.656
That. Worried about that.

17:55.956 --> 17:57.874
There's a giant schmeckle out there.

17:57.958 --> 18:01.252
Hey, so that I can tell Carlos,
are you guys gonna want the saddle

18:01.336 --> 18:02.796
or you wanna ride it bareback?

18:02.879 --> 18:05.966
- Get that thing off the lawn!
- Yeah, get that thing off the lawn!

18:06.049 --> 18:09.135
And do it fast before Mrs. Applebaum
across the street has a heart attack.

18:09.218 --> 18:12.681
- Oh, and like that would be a huge loss.
- Look, guys, it's a party.

18:12.764 --> 18:14.599
We just wanted you guys to have some fun.

18:14.683 --> 18:17.811
Twister is fun. Trivial Pursuit can be fun.

18:17.894 --> 18:21.314
This is mortifying! Can anyone
at least go out and cover it up?

18:21.397 --> 18:22.691
I'll cover it up.

18:22.774 --> 18:25.527
Bud's gonna cover it up. I'm Bud.

18:25.610 --> 18:28.154
Good. Good man. Come, quickly.

18:28.237 --> 18:31.324
Come, quickly. Good man
yourself. Come on, quickly.

18:31.407 --> 18:34.410
Get out there. That's it.
Good man yourself. Good.

18:34.494 --> 18:36.079
[Bud] All right.

18:36.162 --> 18:38.164
Bud is here.

18:39.916 --> 18:43.378
Everything is fine. No one is upset.

18:44.379 --> 18:45.797
Whoa!

18:48.466 --> 18:49.801
I'm Bud.

18:52.178 --> 18:53.638
Ho!

18:55.431 --> 18:57.517
[chuckles]

19:03.857 --> 19:04.983
I got it.

19:05.067 --> 19:07.151
It's covered. I got it covered.

19:07.861 --> 19:08.945
I'm stuck.

19:10.113 --> 19:12.908
Whoa-oh! Whoa...

19:18.747 --> 19:20.082
It's not covered.

19:20.164 --> 19:23.585
It looks like a dead
petting zoo on this table.

19:25.587 --> 19:30.133
Okay, guys. Would you mind
getting us a couple more flyers?

19:30.216 --> 19:31.885
- Flight.
- Absolutely.

19:31.968 --> 19:34.930
Whatever. Okay, Frankie, enough.

19:35.013 --> 19:38.391
I didn't tell you about Guy because...

19:38.474 --> 19:40.810
I was afraid I would make you
feel worse than you already do.

19:40.894 --> 19:43.021
I was just trying to protect your feelings.

19:43.105 --> 19:45.815
That's so insulting. You
don't have to manage me.

19:45.899 --> 19:49.360
I'm not managing anything. I just
want you to have a good time tonight.

19:49.444 --> 19:52.697
I'm not your project. I
have a right to be down.

19:52.781 --> 19:54.574
I have a right to try to cheer you up.

19:54.657 --> 19:57.368
You don't understand.
Everything's changing.

19:57.452 --> 20:01.164
Even this stupid bar. Whiskey flights.

20:01.247 --> 20:03.207
You think you know a bar
and it's there for you,

20:03.291 --> 20:07.712
but suddenly it's not there for
you. It's under new management.

20:07.796 --> 20:11.049
It's moving on without you.

20:11.133 --> 20:12.467
Everything's changing.

20:12.550 --> 20:18.431
I know, I know things are changing,
but maybe not as much as you think.

20:19.432 --> 20:22.185
- What do you mean?
- You can still dance on this bar.

20:22.268 --> 20:26.230
Come on. Don't you want to
do it, just a little bit?

20:26.314 --> 20:29.233
I know I'm supposed to
say yes, but watch my head.

20:29.317 --> 20:31.527
No, come on. I'll do it with you.

20:31.653 --> 20:32.821
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I will.

20:32.904 --> 20:36.407
Can someone please help me
get onto the bar, please?

20:39.119 --> 20:39.953
Oh.

20:40.036 --> 20:43.665
Oh. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I can't do this without her.

20:43.748 --> 20:46.001
[rap music playing]

20:57.846 --> 21:00.556
- Whoa! Don't bump me!
- Maybe you just don't have any rhythm.

21:00.640 --> 21:04.435
You stop right there. Reverse
psychology usually doesn't work on me,

21:04.519 --> 21:06.270
but I'm feeling vulnerable.

21:06.354 --> 21:07.897
Well, dance it out.

21:07.981 --> 21:09.899
I am dancing it.

21:09.983 --> 21:13.069
Excuse me, ma'ams. You're
going to have to get down.

21:13.153 --> 21:15.113
I am getting down!

21:15.197 --> 21:18.783
- [grunting]
- Yo, go girl, yeah, yeah!

21:32.172 --> 21:33.923
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

21:49.772 --> 21:51.066
Whoo!

21:51.149 --> 21:53.609
[laughing]

21:53.693 --> 21:55.361
You are not welcome here!

21:55.444 --> 21:58.489
- Oh, now that I can say yes to!
- [laughs]

21:58.573 --> 22:01.617
- We got kicked out of that bar!
- Oh, we did!

22:01.701 --> 22:04.787
We got roughed up! Like
a couple of hellions.

22:04.871 --> 22:07.749
- You were so bad ass!
- Thank you!

22:07.832 --> 22:09.167
No, no. When someone says that,

22:09.251 --> 22:11.544
you have to say, "That's
right, motherfucker."

22:11.627 --> 22:14.172
- That's right, motherfucker.
- [laughs]

22:14.256 --> 22:16.674
We'll work on it.

22:16.758 --> 22:19.052
- [cheering]
- More juice, Carlos. I'm a big boy.

22:19.135 --> 22:21.263
Whoa!

22:21.345 --> 22:22.972
Mr. Peterson, you're on deck.

22:24.348 --> 22:26.101
[man] Have a little dignity!

22:26.184 --> 22:28.394
Nelson, wait. I'm sorry the
party devolved into this.

22:28.477 --> 22:31.106
It was never our intention to offend.

22:31.189 --> 22:32.648
[crowd cheering]

22:32.732 --> 22:35.526
Good God! Is there another way out of here?

22:35.610 --> 22:38.362
Fine, we'll take you out the
back, but just to be clear,

22:38.446 --> 22:41.407
we have the right to
celebrate any way that we want.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.159
Is that what you think?

22:43.243 --> 22:45.620
The kids thought we'd think it was fun.

22:45.703 --> 22:47.205
They didn't mean any harm.

22:47.289 --> 22:49.540
You know, Robert, you and I go a ways back.

22:49.624 --> 22:50.833
Yes, we do.

22:50.917 --> 22:54.296
And I have to admit every once in a
while, I began to wonder about you.

22:54.378 --> 22:57.715
The pocket squares, always humming opera,

22:57.799 --> 23:00.384
the beautiful wife you never
paid that much attention to.

23:01.677 --> 23:04.013
Then I heard about you
and Sol and I thought,

23:04.097 --> 23:07.309
the less I know about that the better.

23:07.391 --> 23:11.104
But I came tonight
because I am your friend,

23:11.187 --> 23:13.106
and then what do you do?

23:13.189 --> 23:15.191
You throw your lifestyle in my face.

23:15.275 --> 23:18.527
I don't have a problem
with you being a homosexual,

23:18.611 --> 23:21.697
but when did you become such a faggot?

23:23.366 --> 23:26.119
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! He's not worth it.

23:27.287 --> 23:28.330
You're right.

23:29.789 --> 23:31.457
And you're just lucky that that faggot

23:31.540 --> 23:33.876
stopped this faggot from
putting you on your ass.

23:35.128 --> 23:37.046
You can go out the front door,

23:37.130 --> 23:41.926
but you might want to stop for
a picture with the giant phallus.

23:44.762 --> 23:47.473
I'm sorry, Sol. You were right about him.

23:47.556 --> 23:51.311
- You almost hit a man in our foyer.
- I know.

23:52.187 --> 23:56.065
You are so hot right now!

23:59.152 --> 24:02.530
- [laughs]
- Do you want to go outside?

24:02.613 --> 24:05.950
- Oh, God, no!
- Whew, neither do I.

24:06.034 --> 24:08.036
I'll call Mrs. Applebaum.

24:08.119 --> 24:10.372
I'll offer to walk her dog for a month.

24:10.454 --> 24:13.541
- It might take two.
- This turned into a good party.

24:13.624 --> 24:16.127
I know we parked it on the street.

24:16.211 --> 24:19.505
It was near another street, and
there was a black car nearby.

24:19.588 --> 24:20.756
Wasn't it silver?

24:20.840 --> 24:24.427
- Black or silver, it was...
- Where are you going?

24:24.510 --> 24:27.596
- I'm gonna talk to that man.
- He's homeless.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.349
He can still talk.

24:31.267 --> 24:33.769
Excuse me. Have you seen a Leaf?

24:33.853 --> 24:38.400
I see lots of leafs. I
also saw your car get towed.

24:38.482 --> 24:42.028
- Oh.
- Oh, okay. Thanks.

24:43.612 --> 24:47.200
The good news is I know
exactly where the tow lot is.

24:47.283 --> 24:51.413
The bad news, I have so
much weed in that car.

24:51.495 --> 24:53.373
- We'll call a cab.
- Okay.

24:53.456 --> 24:57.210
[sighs] Oh.

24:57.293 --> 25:00.422
- You're gonna sit down there?
- Yeah.

25:04.550 --> 25:08.471
So how did this say yes night measure up?

25:08.554 --> 25:12.600
Grace, we got kicked out of a bar.

25:12.683 --> 25:15.144
My Leaf got towed.

25:15.228 --> 25:17.813
That immediately puts it in the top five.

25:19.357 --> 25:23.111
- So you're feeling a little better?
- I do.

25:23.194 --> 25:25.196
But I'm tired.

25:25.280 --> 25:28.157
Would you tickle my arm?

25:28.241 --> 25:30.118
- [laughs]
- [scoffs]

25:30.201 --> 25:34.038
- When does say yes end?
- When we get home.

25:34.122 --> 25:36.332
Then yes.

25:39.794 --> 25:43.589
- [chuckles]
- [moans]

25:43.672 --> 25:45.300
[laughs]

25:45.383 --> 25:48.719
You know, thinking of you in that bar,

25:48.803 --> 25:52.390
there was some serious shimmying went down.

25:54.142 --> 25:58.729
- We should do it again sometime.
- Mmm, that's nice of you to say.

25:58.813 --> 26:04.444
I know you have Guy, so... I get it.

26:04.527 --> 26:06.904
By the by, I'm happy for you.

26:09.115 --> 26:10.992
I didn't say it back.

26:11.075 --> 26:12.494
What?

26:12.576 --> 26:14.703
When Guy told me he was
falling in love with me,

26:14.787 --> 26:17.999
I didn't say... anything.

26:18.082 --> 26:20.502
- Oh.
- Yeah.

26:20.584 --> 26:23.879
- That's big.
- I know.

26:23.963 --> 26:25.340
What are you going to do?

26:27.008 --> 26:29.635
[sighs] I don't know.

26:40.229 --> 26:43.191
When's that cab gonna get here?

26:43.274 --> 26:45.318
After we call it.

26:45.401 --> 26:47.069
[laughs]

26:47.153 --> 26:48.530
Oh.
