WEBVTT

00:09.142 --> 00:10.844
Use your Mage Armour!

00:10.944 --> 00:14.414
If that mind flayer gets you,
we're done for.

00:14.514 --> 00:17.250
Just say you need a bailout, Paladin.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.618
Stand back, boys.

00:18.718 --> 00:21.888
This is clearly a job
for me and my new battle axe.

00:21.988 --> 00:24.657
Funny,
that is your new nickname.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.927
Watch it, halfling,
or I'll use this thing on you.

00:29.562 --> 00:31.264
I'm surprised
you guys were free.

00:31.364 --> 00:33.099
Doesn't your app
go live this weekend?

00:33.199 --> 00:34.901
Yeah, we were working
on it all night.

00:35.001 --> 00:35.969
Needed a brain break.

00:36.069 --> 00:37.537
Yeah, don't tell Lee.
He'll freak.

00:37.637 --> 00:40.273
Besides, all apps
come out with some bugs.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.541
That's what updates are for.

00:41.641 --> 00:42.776
Isn't that right, Es?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.377
That's what
you keep telling me!

00:44.477 --> 00:45.812
Hang on.

00:45.912 --> 00:47.680
Did you guys hear something?

00:47.781 --> 00:48.681
No.

00:48.782 --> 00:50.116
I'm gonna go check it out.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.385
And a Magic Missile.

00:52.485 --> 00:55.055
This mind flayer
is getting to me, man.

00:58.458 --> 00:59.626
Es?

00:59.726 --> 01:00.693
You okay?

01:00.794 --> 01:01.728
Clark, what's going on?

01:01.828 --> 01:03.863
Es?
Hon?

01:04.864 --> 01:05.965
Oh my God.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.934
Esme?
Clark?

01:08.034 --> 01:11.204

Ahh!

02:03.456 --> 02:05.291
Oh...

02:09.496 --> 02:12.832
Oh...

02:12.932 --> 02:15.335
Eeh...

02:20.206 --> 02:21.374
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:21.474 --> 02:23.209
Oh God!
Mom, what are you wearing?

02:23.309 --> 02:25.178
- Put clothes on!
- It's my bathroom!

02:25.278 --> 02:26.546
What are you doing in here?

02:26.646 --> 02:27.614
I had a headache.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.115
I just wanted to...

02:29.215 --> 02:30.617
get a cold compress.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.485
Yeah, well, I heard
something breaking.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.654
Nope.
Just my spirit.

02:34.754 --> 02:35.855
Alastair called.

02:35.955 --> 02:38.324
His tech developer friends
might have a case for us.

02:38.424 --> 02:40.360
What does Alastair do, exactly?

02:40.460 --> 02:42.328
He is an IT consultant.

02:42.428 --> 02:43.897
Mm-hm?

02:43.997 --> 02:45.331
I'll go change.

02:45.431 --> 02:47.367
Let me know if you
want to borrow a hairbrush.

02:47.467 --> 02:48.568
Ugh!

02:57.911 --> 03:00.847
Isn't this more of a "pickleball
and preserves" kind of town?

03:00.947 --> 03:02.882
Why would tech developers
be based here?

03:02.982 --> 03:05.251
Actually, the tech biz
is booming in Alder Bluffs.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.086
They call it
Silicon Valley North!

03:07.187 --> 03:09.355
Okay, now you're
just making stuff up.

03:09.455 --> 03:11.357
Oh, one second.

03:11.457 --> 03:13.826
Ah...

03:13.927 --> 03:15.061
Hey, thanks for coming.

03:15.161 --> 03:16.129
You're Alastair's friends, right?

03:16.229 --> 03:18.264
Yes, Victoria,
and this is Darby.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.999
We're the Spencer Sisters.

03:20.099 --> 03:21.834
We're not sisters.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.036
Right, uh...

03:23.136 --> 03:25.305
Well, uh, Alastair told me
you're an expert in crime.

03:25.405 --> 03:26.372
Uh, solving crime!

03:26.472 --> 03:28.508
Right, well, I'm Clark
and this is Esme.

03:28.608 --> 03:30.877
Oh, dear.

03:30.977 --> 03:32.478
Can you tell us what happened?

03:32.579 --> 03:34.514
Well, we were gaming
with Alastair.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.182
I heard Esme scream.

03:36.282 --> 03:38.084
I ran downstairs
and found her in the kitchen.

03:38.184 --> 03:39.586
Someone attacked her.

03:39.686 --> 03:40.620
Who?

03:40.720 --> 03:41.754
I don't know.

03:41.854 --> 03:45.024
But whoever they were,
they stole our server.

03:45.124 --> 03:47.393
All of our data
for the app was on it.

03:47.493 --> 03:49.729
We're developing
a health care app called Triaj.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.497
We're supposed to
go live in three days.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.366
Why didn't you
just call the police?

03:53.466 --> 03:55.235
Let's just say
I'm not the biggest fan

03:55.335 --> 03:56.402
of Alder Bluffs' finest.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.705
We may have, uh,
said police departments

03:58.805 --> 04:01.441
should receive less funding
and/or be abolished,

04:01.541 --> 04:02.775
publicly and repeatedly.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.278
Hmm, my sister
used to be a police officer.

04:05.378 --> 04:07.947
We're not sisters.

04:08.047 --> 04:09.682
Hey, are you okay?

04:09.782 --> 04:11.451
I came as soon
as I got your call.

04:11.551 --> 04:13.820
I'm fine, Lee.
I swear.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.887
These are Alastair's friends.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.122
They're detectives.

04:16.222 --> 04:17.290
Our roommate, Lee.

04:17.390 --> 04:18.791
The money guy.

04:18.891 --> 04:19.792
Hello.

04:19.892 --> 04:22.195
Is the backup server okay?

04:23.663 --> 04:26.766
Okay, we're running.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.638
No, no, my God!

04:31.738 --> 04:33.873
Oh, we're screwed!

04:35.975 --> 04:38.244
Why is the garage door open?

04:43.850 --> 04:45.285
Oh!

04:45.385 --> 04:46.819
The server!

04:46.919 --> 04:48.421
No, no, no, no!

04:48.521 --> 04:49.822
Yeah, it's the backup.

04:49.922 --> 04:52.325
Two years'
worth of work, gone!

04:52.425 --> 04:53.960
We go live with
the app on Sunday

04:54.060 --> 04:55.595
or we lose 500,000 subscribers.

04:55.695 --> 04:58.765
And get destroyed in reviews.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.600
Can you help us get
our stolen server back?

05:00.700 --> 05:01.834
Of course.

05:01.934 --> 05:03.736
Any friends of Alastair's
are friends of ours.

05:03.836 --> 05:06.205
Maybe we should
discuss the terms first,

05:06.306 --> 05:08.708
including payment?

05:08.808 --> 05:10.643
Sorry, I know
it's not a great time;

05:10.743 --> 05:12.545
it's just that what
we're doing together now

05:12.645 --> 05:14.514
is a business, so...

05:14.614 --> 05:16.282
We'll save
the paperwork for later.

05:16.382 --> 05:20.753
We do this because we love it,
not for the money!

05:40.340 --> 05:42.975
I was here,
gaming with Alastair and Clark.

05:43.076 --> 05:47.013
I heard a noise in the kitchen,
and I knew Lee was out,

05:47.113 --> 05:48.381
so I went to see.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.183
Okay, show me
what happened next.

05:50.283 --> 05:54.487
The front door was closed,
so I walked through here.

05:54.587 --> 05:59.158
When I came around the corner,
he hit me with something.

05:59.258 --> 06:01.427
When I passed out,
he must've grabbed the server.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.196
Was he tall, short?

06:03.296 --> 06:05.498
Did you get a sense of
what he was wearing?

06:05.598 --> 06:07.033
He was dressed
in all black,

06:07.133 --> 06:08.568
wearing gloves, I think?

06:08.668 --> 06:10.370
It was a blur, sorry.

06:10.470 --> 06:11.838
Okay.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.773
Are there any security cameras
in the house?

06:13.873 --> 06:15.074
A doorbell cam.

06:15.174 --> 06:16.909
I can email you the footage.

06:17.009 --> 06:18.711
Yeah, do that.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.323
Bingo.

06:32.792 --> 06:34.560
Why don't you tell me
about the app?

06:34.660 --> 06:36.462
Well, it's called
"Triaj" with a J.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.798
It's a wellness app designed
to give people more agency

06:38.898 --> 06:40.066
into their own health care.

06:40.166 --> 06:42.101
Basically,
users input biometric data--

06:42.201 --> 06:44.370
Or it's collected from
pre-existing wearable tech,

06:44.470 --> 06:45.571
like a smart watch--

06:45.671 --> 06:46.706
Cool!

06:46.806 --> 06:48.141
And the app monitors symptoms

06:48.241 --> 06:49.809
and diagnoses problems
based off probabilities.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.477
So if it detects a heart murmur,

06:51.577 --> 06:52.945
you can get ahead
of heart disease--

06:53.045 --> 06:54.547
Yeah, tell her
about the eye scan!

06:54.647 --> 06:56.115
Yeah, so Clark coded
this cool feature

06:56.215 --> 06:58.117
where the app uses the phone's
camera and flashlight

06:58.217 --> 06:59.452
to record a retinal scan.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.053
A retinal scan with this?

07:01.154 --> 07:03.589
Yeah, and it can detect
things like Lyme disease,

07:03.689 --> 07:04.657
jaundice...

07:04.757 --> 07:05.758
- And, uh...
- Diabetes.

07:05.858 --> 07:06.959
Yeah, yeah.

07:07.059 --> 07:09.796
Can it warn you before
you have a hot flash?

07:09.896 --> 07:11.130
That is a great idea.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.132
We need to put that
in the next version.

07:13.232 --> 07:14.233
Where's a pen?
Oh...

07:14.333 --> 07:16.402
Okay,
are there any other investors?

07:16.502 --> 07:18.171
No, we wanted
to retain ownership,

07:18.271 --> 07:19.405
so Lee bankrolled development,

07:19.505 --> 07:21.340
and it's finally ready
to launch to its users.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.142
I've been hyping it
at TechSummit.

07:23.242 --> 07:25.845
We've got hundreds of thousands
of early-bird subscribers.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.314
Yeah, and if we don't deliver,

07:28.414 --> 07:29.649
they'll leave
and never come back.

07:29.749 --> 07:33.486
And all that money
down the drain...

07:33.586 --> 07:34.454
Hey, you!

07:34.554 --> 07:35.922
It's been a minute.

07:36.022 --> 07:37.023
Uh, my God, I'm so sorry.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.791
I totally forgot
you were waiting in the car.

07:38.891 --> 07:40.326
Yeah, you going back
to the conference?

07:40.426 --> 07:41.961
'Cause I can just chill
and wait here.

07:42.061 --> 07:43.796
I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

07:43.896 --> 07:44.997
Can I call you a cab?

07:45.097 --> 07:46.098
Okay, 2015!

07:46.199 --> 07:47.834
I'll just call a ride share.

07:47.934 --> 07:49.001
Girlfriend?

07:49.101 --> 07:50.169
Influencer.

07:50.269 --> 07:52.505
Candy Boisclair,
A.K.A. "Candy B."

07:52.605 --> 07:54.006
Half a million followers.

07:54.106 --> 07:56.209
Lee's hanging with her
in hopes she'll hype Triaj.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.010
- Hmph! Tough gig.
- Mm-hm.

07:58.110 --> 08:01.614
Huh, no scratch marks
or warping in any of the doors

08:01.714 --> 08:03.316
to indicate a break-in.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.384
I think I found
the weapon of convenience.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.686
That could've killed her!

08:06.786 --> 08:08.087
I'm fine, babe.

08:08.187 --> 08:09.856
If the intruder wanted
to hurt Esme seriously,

08:09.956 --> 08:10.890
they would have.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.959
This must be about the server.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.460
Do you have any idea

08:14.560 --> 08:17.196
who might've wanted
access to your work?

08:17.296 --> 08:18.698
Parker Dunn.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.833
He's a developer
working on something similar

08:20.933 --> 08:22.235
in the VR space.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.504
You know, he actually
took me out a few months ago.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.138
Tried to get me drunk.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.974
Tried getting details
about how Triaj works.

08:28.074 --> 08:29.542
Where might we find him?

08:29.642 --> 08:31.711
Well, he's doing demos
at TechSummit this week, right?

08:31.811 --> 08:33.713
You should definitely
check out TechSummit.

08:33.813 --> 08:36.148
Developers and investors
come from all over.

08:36.249 --> 08:39.552
This area's kind of like
Silicon Valley North.

08:39.652 --> 08:41.187
Told ya.

08:41.287 --> 08:43.556
And pickleball is great workout,
by the way.

08:43.656 --> 08:45.124
Pew!

08:51.297 --> 08:52.932
Very nerdy, but...

08:53.032 --> 08:55.668
cool.

08:55.768 --> 08:57.670
You know,
I've always been interested

08:57.770 --> 08:59.171
in virtual reality.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.041
Your whole life
is a virtual reality.

09:02.141 --> 09:03.409
True.
I think that's him.

09:03.509 --> 09:05.011
Yeah.

09:07.346 --> 09:08.581
Parker?

09:08.681 --> 09:09.682
Could we have a minute?

09:09.782 --> 09:11.384
You looking to
try this thing out?

09:11.484 --> 09:14.387
No, we were hoping to
chat with you about Triaj.

09:14.487 --> 09:15.588
Triaj?

09:15.688 --> 09:17.957
I'm not a part of Triaj.
You'll have to talk to Lee.

09:18.057 --> 09:19.191
We did talk to Lee,

09:19.292 --> 09:21.260
and we understand
that you were keen on it.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.261
Lee said that?

09:22.361 --> 09:23.229
Mm-hm.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.530
Well, it's not true.

09:24.630 --> 09:28.100
We're working on a health care
app as well, okay?

09:28.200 --> 09:29.168
A different one.

09:29.268 --> 09:31.537
It helps you actually
visualize your diagnosis

09:31.637 --> 09:32.772
and treatment options,

09:32.872 --> 09:34.440
and connects you
with the right specialist.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.142
Sounds a lot like Triaj,
doesn't it?

09:36.242 --> 09:37.710
Mm-hm.

09:37.810 --> 09:41.113
Lee wishes that he thought
of this first, okay?

09:41.213 --> 09:42.582
But you know the expression,

09:42.682 --> 09:45.017
"Know your enemy.
In war and business."

09:45.117 --> 09:46.118
Enemy?

09:46.218 --> 09:47.553
Wow.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.388
Where were you this morning,

09:49.488 --> 09:51.557
between 7 and 8 am?

09:51.657 --> 09:54.327
I was on
an Early Bird Breakfast Panel,

09:54.427 --> 09:56.996
which you can confirm
with a couple of hundred people

09:57.096 --> 09:58.764
who made it there to see me.

10:03.469 --> 10:05.471
The conference
is on for two more days.

10:05.571 --> 10:07.406
We need to see who else
was targeting Triaj.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.378
No, no--

10:12.478 --> 10:14.947
that's a gift from
the Duchess of Warwick!

10:15.047 --> 10:16.983
No!

10:17.083 --> 10:19.418
Hands where I can see them!
Who are you?

10:19.518 --> 10:21.220
Are you here about
the stolen server?

10:21.320 --> 10:22.755
Uh... no?

10:22.855 --> 10:27.760
I am here to transform
this space into a functional

10:27.860 --> 10:29.462
yet elegant professional milieu.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.998
Ugh, Rory, it's you!

10:32.098 --> 10:36.636
Rory is my friend and interior
designer extraordinaire.

10:36.736 --> 10:40.806
Vic, she always gets my
friend discount on my expertise,

10:40.906 --> 10:42.508
which is considerable.

10:42.608 --> 10:44.510
My expertise, not the discount.

10:44.610 --> 10:47.113
I asked Rory to come help us
set up our new office.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.281
I gave him the keys,
but I thought you said Friday!

10:49.382 --> 10:50.449
Oh, well, I had a window,

10:50.549 --> 10:52.418
so I thought I'd come
and take some measurements.

10:52.518 --> 10:53.552
Hang on!

10:53.653 --> 10:55.388
You were gonna turn my bedroom
into our office?

10:55.488 --> 10:56.455
Yeah, it's the ideal space!

10:56.555 --> 10:58.591
Ideal for me to sleep in!

10:58.691 --> 11:00.192
Were you even gonna ask me?

11:00.292 --> 11:03.963
There are plenty of other
rooms in the house, honey.

11:04.063 --> 11:06.499
Besides, this wasn't even
supposed to be a bedroom.

11:06.599 --> 11:07.900
It's miles away from the others.

11:08.000 --> 11:08.834
Yeah, I know!

11:08.934 --> 11:10.736
Why do you think
13-year-old me chose it?

11:10.836 --> 11:13.939
You are not kicking me
out of my bedroom, mm-mm.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.175
Besides, I know
a much better office space!

11:16.275 --> 11:17.843
- Huh?
- Come!

11:17.943 --> 11:19.011
See?

11:19.111 --> 11:21.047
It's spacious,
there's great lighting,

11:21.147 --> 11:23.883
it's accessible from
the main entrance...

11:23.983 --> 11:26.485
This is a lovely space.

11:26.585 --> 11:29.055
This is my writing room.
I need to write!

11:29.155 --> 11:31.791
"There are plenty of other
rooms in the house, honey."

11:31.891 --> 11:33.192
Not gonna happen.

11:36.762 --> 11:38.798
Esme sent the footage.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.909
Hmm,
there's no one coming or going.

11:50.009 --> 11:51.077
Hmm.

11:51.177 --> 11:52.912
The thief must have
used the kitchen door,

11:53.012 --> 11:54.680
where there's no camera.

11:54.780 --> 11:58.284
Oh, look!
That's us arriving.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.719
- See, you do slouch.
- Ugh!

11:59.819 --> 12:03.222
Oh my...

12:03.322 --> 12:06.759
Oh, that's Lee!

12:06.859 --> 12:08.594
Who's that with him?

12:08.694 --> 12:09.995
That must be Candy B,

12:10.096 --> 12:12.398
some kind of
internet influencer.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.100
Wait, wait, wait, hang on.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.868
What the hell
is she doing?

12:15.968 --> 12:18.104
Why is she taking
pictures of his stuff?

12:18.204 --> 12:19.505
We should talk to Candy B.

12:19.605 --> 12:21.407
Yes, we should!

12:21.507 --> 12:23.042
I mean, you should...

12:23.142 --> 12:24.310
definitely handle it.

12:24.410 --> 12:25.678
Come on.

12:27.913 --> 12:30.950
Lee said he thinks
Candy's staying in Room 513.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.218
That's this way.

12:32.318 --> 12:36.288
Yes, Mom, I know how
sequential numbering works.

12:42.061 --> 12:43.863
Hello, again.

12:43.963 --> 12:46.165
Who is it?

12:46.265 --> 12:49.101
Oh, crap.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.042
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

12:57.143 --> 12:58.644
You two are just friends,

12:58.744 --> 13:01.580
but somehow you convinced her
to be a honeytrap for Lee?

13:01.680 --> 13:04.283
Well, Candy is
a legit influencer.

13:04.383 --> 13:06.919
And, "You cannot call yourself
a proper warrior

13:07.019 --> 13:10.389
"if you refuse to use all
the weapons in your arsenal."

13:10.489 --> 13:11.757
Sun Tzu.

13:11.857 --> 13:14.326
Didn't know "The Art of War"
applied to health care apps.

13:14.426 --> 13:16.262
I barely got
anything out of Lee.

13:16.362 --> 13:19.231
Yeah, he wasn't that into me,
for some reason.

13:19.331 --> 13:20.332
Huh.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.168
Well, let me ask you a question.

13:22.268 --> 13:25.204
Were you with him
this morning before 8 am?

13:25.304 --> 13:27.740
We were going to the first panel
of the day together,

13:27.840 --> 13:29.308
so we had breakfast at the bar.

13:29.408 --> 13:33.312
But he saw someone, bolted--
no explanation.

13:33.412 --> 13:36.081
And he was gone
about 45 minutes.

13:36.182 --> 13:37.950
- Bolted?
- Yeah.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.585
Where were you while you waited?

13:39.685 --> 13:42.688
At the bar.
I had two mimosas.

13:42.788 --> 13:44.590
Seriously?

13:44.690 --> 13:45.591
What?

13:45.691 --> 13:48.761
Ugh, spying's hard work!

13:48.861 --> 13:51.063
I agree.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.432
Yes, the one
in the bright pink jacket.

13:53.532 --> 13:56.602
Okay, great.
Thank you so much.

13:56.702 --> 13:59.371
The bartender definitely
remembers that she was there,

13:59.471 --> 14:01.774
and her delicious
pair of mimosas.

14:02.875 --> 14:05.244
Hey, I have
some whitefish.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.379
How about some dinner?
We could whip up a salad.

14:07.479 --> 14:08.347
That's okay.

14:08.447 --> 14:09.982
I have a burrito
in here somewhere.

14:10.082 --> 14:11.417
Oh, I threw it away.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.219
What?

14:13.319 --> 14:14.553
That was mine!

14:14.653 --> 14:16.322
I happen to like a clean fridge.

14:16.422 --> 14:18.757
Well, I happen to like
a fridge that has the burrito

14:18.858 --> 14:20.359
I was saving in it.

14:20.459 --> 14:22.027
Please don't touch my stuff!

14:22.127 --> 14:24.296
You're one to talk!
I found my face cream.

14:24.396 --> 14:25.965
Or at least its burial site.

14:26.065 --> 14:28.267
Well, that was different
because that was an accident.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.603
The breaking it, or the snooping
around in my bathroom?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.805
I wasn't sn--
Ugh!

14:32.905 --> 14:34.740
I'm not hungry anymore.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.008
Oh, okay.

14:36.108 --> 14:37.843
Fine, be that way.

14:42.615 --> 14:43.916
It wasn't ready anyway!

14:44.016 --> 14:46.185
Because if you'd have
worked out the bugs earlier,

14:46.285 --> 14:47.786
we would've launched months ago!

14:47.887 --> 14:49.922
Uh-huh, easy for you
to say, Mr. Trust Fund!

14:50.022 --> 14:51.657
You don't do any
of the actual work.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.058
And why haven't
we transferred already

14:53.158 --> 14:54.426
to an offsite
storage server, huh?

14:55.594 --> 14:57.296
We have updates!

14:57.396 --> 14:59.365
Parker was a dead end.

14:59.465 --> 15:00.633
And, plot twist,

15:00.733 --> 15:04.136
Candy was his friend
and she was spying on you all.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.137
What?

15:05.237 --> 15:07.306
Wow, way to vet
your girlfriends.

15:07.406 --> 15:09.808
In Lee's defence,
she says she didn't learn much.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.644
And her alibi is airtight.

15:11.744 --> 15:15.281
So, if it wasn't Parker,
who else knew about the app?

15:15.381 --> 15:17.149
Or where the server was located?

15:17.249 --> 15:18.951
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

15:19.051 --> 15:22.988
Six months ago, Lee did
a livestream about Triaj.

15:23.088 --> 15:26.492
He videoed a walkthrough
around the house, introduced us,

15:26.592 --> 15:28.494
and gave a sneak peek
about our work.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.963
You showed the thief
exactly where to go!

15:31.063 --> 15:32.431
So, the walkthrough
brought out

15:32.531 --> 15:33.999
all kinds of trolls
in the comments.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.467
A lot of scumbags
went after Esme.

15:35.567 --> 15:36.635
Why Esme?

15:36.735 --> 15:39.705
'Cause I dare to do my job
while having lady parts.

15:39.805 --> 15:41.774
Oh, yeah.
We get that.

15:44.643 --> 15:48.547
Okay, do any of these trolls
live under local bridges?

15:50.516 --> 15:52.418
Thank you, Alastair.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.486
So, Alastair went through
the comments

15:54.586 --> 15:55.721
on Lee's live stream

15:55.821 --> 15:57.723
and filtered for
local IP addresses.

15:57.823 --> 15:58.857
And?

15:58.958 --> 16:01.593
There's only one,
a guy named Jesse France.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.395
He went after Esme in a big way,

16:03.495 --> 16:05.097
so he's gonna
text us his address.

16:05.197 --> 16:07.266
How does Alastair have
this guy's home address?

16:07.366 --> 16:09.935
He's a very talented
IT consultant.

16:10.035 --> 16:12.004
Well, look who's here.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.205
More coffee?

16:13.305 --> 16:14.573
When are you gonna tell Antonio

16:14.673 --> 16:16.408
that you married him
for his Americanos?

16:16.508 --> 16:17.576
Never, and neither are you.

16:17.676 --> 16:20.145
Victoria, Darby, perfecto!

16:20.245 --> 16:24.750
I am working out the kinks
on these coxinha de frango.

16:24.850 --> 16:26.885
Mmm, incredible!

16:26.986 --> 16:28.153
Really?

16:28.253 --> 16:29.488
I think I can die happy now.

16:29.588 --> 16:30.923
- Yes!
- Wow.

16:31.023 --> 16:33.792
So, um, I'm gonna add them
to the list for your party.

16:33.892 --> 16:34.927
Party?

16:35.027 --> 16:37.596
We're throwing an intimate
cocktail party tomorrow

16:37.696 --> 16:41.200
to celebrate the opening
of the Spencer Sisters agency!

16:41.300 --> 16:43.068
Who's we?
When was this decided?

16:43.168 --> 16:46.071
Well, I didn't think
I need permission

16:46.171 --> 16:48.073
to invite people
to my own house.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.442
It's my house, too.
I also live there.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.244
Very dramatic!

16:52.344 --> 16:53.612
What else do we have?

16:53.712 --> 16:56.615
- Come with me.
- Okay.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.918
I didn't know
you didn't know.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.587
So, what,
you're pals with my mom now?

17:01.687 --> 17:04.289
She's fun!
And a great storyteller.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.225
She told us about
this time you were six,

17:06.325 --> 17:10.729
you had to pee but couldn't
get the snowsuit off in time...

17:10.829 --> 17:11.930
You had to be there.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.098
I was there!

17:13.198 --> 17:14.333
The first time!

17:14.433 --> 17:16.702
Come on, you know you'll
always be my ride or die.

17:16.802 --> 17:18.971
Yeah, except now I have
to share you with my mother.

17:19.071 --> 17:21.673
Like everything else.

17:21.774 --> 17:24.810
Ah, alright!
Time to go get our troll!

17:26.945 --> 17:27.846
Goodbye!

17:27.946 --> 17:28.814
Thanks!

17:28.914 --> 17:29.882
Yeah.

17:29.982 --> 17:30.916
Not bad.

17:31.016 --> 17:32.151
Trolls, trolls, trolls.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.586
Ugh, I bet
he lives at his mom's house.

17:34.686 --> 17:36.355
I live in my mom's house!

17:36.455 --> 17:38.457
That's different!

17:38.557 --> 17:39.558
Jesse France?

17:39.658 --> 17:40.659
Yeah?

17:40.759 --> 17:41.660
Who's asking?

17:41.760 --> 17:43.162
We are.

17:43.262 --> 17:45.697
We have a few questions for you
about your online activity.

17:48.133 --> 17:50.969
I just sent in my application
like last week.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.372
Come again?

17:57.242 --> 18:00.779
You guys are with CSIS, right?

18:00.879 --> 18:03.515
Okay.
Yeah, we got your application.

18:03.615 --> 18:06.051
And, as you know,
we thoroughly vet

18:06.151 --> 18:08.320
all of our
prospective operatives.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.988
Operatives, yeah.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.623
And in looking into you,

18:11.723 --> 18:15.027
we found evidence of you
harassing women online.

18:15.127 --> 18:16.695
No, I don't--
I don't do that.

18:16.795 --> 18:20.365
Did you or did you not
comment on a live stream

18:20.466 --> 18:22.367
for a company called Triaj,

18:22.468 --> 18:24.536
and refer to
the female coder as,

18:24.636 --> 18:29.041
and I quote,
"Basic Java Feminazi b-word"?

18:29.141 --> 18:30.976
Okay, uh, yes, I did that.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.144
I did that, but I--

18:32.244 --> 18:33.512
I didn't mean anything by it.

18:33.612 --> 18:34.847
I just get pissed off sometimes.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.482
Oh, I bet you do.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.951
It must be tough for you
when people claim space

18:39.051 --> 18:40.619
that you think
is rightfully yours.

18:40.719 --> 18:41.987
I guess?

18:42.087 --> 18:44.890
You ever get so pissed off
that you wanted to hurt Esme?

18:44.990 --> 18:45.891
And her company?

18:45.991 --> 18:46.959
Well, no, no!

18:47.059 --> 18:49.828
Look, I stopped bugging her.
I swear, okay?

18:49.928 --> 18:51.663
After her aggro boyfriend
came around

18:51.763 --> 18:53.532
and I thought he was
gonna kill me.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.967
Kill you?
Her boyfriend?

18:55.067 --> 18:56.301
Yeah.

18:56.401 --> 18:58.504
The-- the nerdy guy with
the long hair and the glasses?

18:58.604 --> 19:01.707
No, the fancy suit guy
from the live stream.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.076
Luke.
Or Lee something.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.044
Lee!

19:08.380 --> 19:11.083
Alright, Jesse.
Thank you so much for your time.

19:11.183 --> 19:12.684
Wait, hold on.

19:12.784 --> 19:14.253
So, do I get the job?

19:14.353 --> 19:16.588
Stop being a lowlife
and start respecting women,

19:16.688 --> 19:20.859
and maybe
we'll talk to you again.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.861
Yes, sir!

19:22.961 --> 19:25.230
I mean ma'am!

19:25.330 --> 19:26.565
I can do that.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.301
So Lee tracked him down
and threatened him

19:29.401 --> 19:31.670
and never mentioned it to us?

19:31.770 --> 19:33.639
What else is he lying about?

19:38.510 --> 19:40.746
Lee, still attending TechSummit?

19:40.846 --> 19:43.815
Yeah, we're, uh...
keeping up appearances.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.284
If we can get our server back,

19:45.384 --> 19:47.719
we'll still want to make
the app go live on Sunday.

19:47.819 --> 19:49.321
- We met with Esme's troll.
- Mm!

19:49.421 --> 19:51.590
He said you paid him a visit.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.824
Yeah, I did.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.526
It's my job to make sure
that Clark and Esme

19:54.626 --> 19:56.628
can focus on work.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.297
I was just resolving a problem.

19:58.397 --> 19:59.264
Mm-hm?

19:59.364 --> 20:01.633
How did you find Jesse?

20:01.733 --> 20:04.102
I pretended to be a troll.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.138
It's actually ridiculously easy

20:06.238 --> 20:07.773
to get them to believe
you're one of them.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.341
It's kind of pathetic, really.

20:09.441 --> 20:11.343
Wouldn't sending
a cease and desist

20:11.443 --> 20:14.980
have been more professional?

20:15.080 --> 20:19.818
Oh,
you have feelings for Esme...

20:19.918 --> 20:21.119
Yeah.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.155
Esme and I were together.

20:23.255 --> 20:24.556
This year,
she got interested in Clark.

20:24.656 --> 20:25.857
I wish them
nothing but the best.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.126
But you haven't totally moved on

20:28.227 --> 20:32.464
and you don't want either
of them to know that, right?

20:32.564 --> 20:34.833
It's kind of a messy situation.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.001
Okay, yes.

20:36.101 --> 20:37.369
Yeah, I still love Esme.

20:37.469 --> 20:39.605
So you can't blame me
for going after the guy

20:39.705 --> 20:42.374
threatening the person
I love, alright?

20:42.474 --> 20:44.343
I'm so sorry, sir.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.144
Your card was declined.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.914
That's strange.
Here, just use this one instead.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.782
We heard you left
Candy at the bar.

20:50.882 --> 20:52.017
Who did you meet with?

20:52.117 --> 20:54.419
Uh, there was an old friend
passing through.

20:54.519 --> 20:59.625
We caught up.
Can you excuse me?

20:59.725 --> 21:01.126
I'm not quite buying it.

21:01.226 --> 21:03.061
He seems awfully secretive
about this meeting.

21:03.161 --> 21:05.097
He's secretive about everything.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.299
Technically,
he would've had time to go home

21:07.399 --> 21:08.667
and commit the theft...

21:08.767 --> 21:12.504
Wow, you don't actually think
he would hit Esme, do you?

21:13.939 --> 21:17.242
Wait, hold on.
I have an idea.

21:20.912 --> 21:22.247
Excuse me.

21:22.347 --> 21:23.615
I'm so sorry to bother you.

21:23.715 --> 21:25.017
No, not a problem.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.853
When you were here...

21:27.953 --> 21:30.889
I'm so sorry!

21:30.989 --> 21:32.257
I really appreciate it.

21:32.357 --> 21:35.260
- No, of course.
- Thanks!

21:35.360 --> 21:37.362
That waiter was working
breakfast yesterday

21:37.462 --> 21:39.831
and saw Lee leave
after another woman.

21:39.931 --> 21:41.199
Her name was Monica Chandras.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.234
Who's that?

21:42.334 --> 21:43.835
He says she's
the panellist here.

21:43.935 --> 21:45.570
She's some big deal.
I don't know.

21:45.671 --> 21:46.672
Let's go find her.

21:46.772 --> 21:48.407
Is there anyone
you won't flirt with?

21:48.507 --> 21:49.975
I was just being cordial.

21:50.075 --> 21:52.444
You would know it
if I was flirting.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.548
So Monica,
you met with Lee?

21:56.648 --> 21:58.317
Sure, I met with Lee.

21:58.417 --> 22:00.118
He was looking for
an eleventh-hour investor.

22:00.218 --> 22:02.220
We understood Triaj
didn't want outside investment;

22:02.321 --> 22:04.356
they wanted to retain ownership
of the company.

22:04.456 --> 22:06.191
That's not what he told me.

22:06.291 --> 22:08.593
Well, were you interested
in investing?

22:08.694 --> 22:11.363
I'm not interested
in the health care space.

22:11.463 --> 22:13.532
Theranos killed that for me.

22:13.632 --> 22:15.567
Please join me
in welcoming

22:15.667 --> 22:17.469
one of the most influential
women in tech...

22:17.569 --> 22:18.870
Excuse me.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.239
...Monica Chandras!

22:24.176 --> 22:25.444
They were about to launch.

22:25.544 --> 22:29.247
Why would Lee be
meeting a new investor?

22:29.348 --> 22:30.582
Hmm.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.851
So, I pulled these
from Lee's socials.

22:32.951 --> 22:35.887
So, okay, you know,
he's clearly a guy who travels.

22:35.987 --> 22:37.622
And he looks
pretty good doing it.

22:37.723 --> 22:41.793
Look at that.
He's got a $6,000 Nadia suit.

22:41.893 --> 22:43.395
$6,000?

22:43.495 --> 22:44.763
That's more than my car!

22:44.863 --> 22:48.133
Yeah, by about $5,000.

22:48.233 --> 22:49.301
Oh, wait...

22:49.401 --> 22:53.271
Now, there are
the pants from it.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.407
And here's the jacket from it.

22:55.507 --> 22:56.441
Huh...

22:56.541 --> 22:57.876
That's weird.

22:57.976 --> 23:00.011
So he mixes and matches
pieces from the same suit.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.012
So what?

23:01.113 --> 23:02.814
Honey, if you can
afford a Nadia suit,

23:02.914 --> 23:03.949
you don't "mix and match."

23:04.049 --> 23:06.084
You have a whole closet
full of them.

23:06.184 --> 23:07.285
Huh.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.954
I think something's off here.

23:09.054 --> 23:12.290
That's a bright, sunny day,
but Lee doesn't cast a shadow.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.626
So, he's a ghost?

23:14.726 --> 23:18.597
Hmm, let me do
a reverse image search.

23:25.771 --> 23:27.472
That's the same picture!

23:27.572 --> 23:30.175
He just comped himself in?

23:30.275 --> 23:33.979
Lee's not a ghost.
He's a fake.

23:40.485 --> 23:42.053
Lee?

23:42.154 --> 23:43.555
Lee, we need to talk!

23:43.655 --> 23:47.893
Let the man
finish his swim.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.995
Okay.

23:53.498 --> 23:56.334
We know about your
fake photos on social media.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.036
And your credit card
was declined.

23:58.136 --> 23:59.738
What's your story?

23:59.838 --> 24:02.607
You're not rich, are you?

24:04.709 --> 24:07.712
My family lost everything
while I was in university.

24:07.813 --> 24:11.049
Bad investments.

24:11.149 --> 24:14.886
I was so used to living
that life, I just kept it up.

24:14.986 --> 24:17.222
People take you seriously
when you're rich.

24:17.322 --> 24:20.959
Do Clark and Esme
know about this?

24:21.059 --> 24:22.060
No.

24:22.160 --> 24:23.728
That's a lot of secrets
for one house.

24:23.829 --> 24:25.630
Look, I didn't steal
the server, okay?

24:25.730 --> 24:29.401
The others think I'm personally
bankrolling development...

24:29.501 --> 24:31.002
Hundreds of thousands in debt.

24:31.102 --> 24:32.637
Is that why you met with Monica?

24:32.737 --> 24:34.806
Yeah, we had a huge influx
of subscribers

24:34.906 --> 24:36.174
at the beginning of TechSummit.

24:36.274 --> 24:38.577
We needed to scale up
to offsite storage.

24:38.677 --> 24:40.045
That's crazy expensive.

24:40.145 --> 24:44.216
You know, no cash flow,
no chance at a bridge loan.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.151
Going to Monica
was our Hail Mary.

24:46.251 --> 24:47.352
But she wasn't interested.

24:47.452 --> 24:49.654
Oh, she was
definitely interested.

24:49.754 --> 24:51.857
But in pieces of the app.

24:51.957 --> 24:55.627
I didn't want her
breaking Triaj up for parts.

24:55.727 --> 24:58.296
What's going on?

24:58.396 --> 25:00.765
Lee, we'll check in
with you tomorrow.

25:00.866 --> 25:04.202
Seems like you guys
have a lot to talk about.

25:32.964 --> 25:34.866
See, I'm--
I'm responsible

25:34.966 --> 25:36.535
for the agency's aesthetic,

25:36.635 --> 25:40.305
which is much more integral
than you might think.

25:40.405 --> 25:42.641
Excuse me.

25:42.741 --> 25:44.142
Isn't it kind of wrong to party

25:44.242 --> 25:45.810
when we've hit a wall
with the case?

25:45.911 --> 25:47.212
Don't be such a wet blanket!

25:47.312 --> 25:48.847
Life can't just stop, you know?

25:50.448 --> 25:52.884
Please tell me
you did not invite my ex.

25:52.984 --> 25:55.887
Well, that would
obviously be a lie.

25:57.088 --> 25:58.890
Oh, come on!
We're all friends.

25:58.990 --> 25:59.891
No.

25:59.991 --> 26:01.159
Someone needs a drink!

26:01.259 --> 26:04.729
Oh, thank you!
I really needed this.

26:04.829 --> 26:06.164
Mmm!

26:06.264 --> 26:08.133
Excellent.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.701
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Zane.

26:09.801 --> 26:10.902
Hey, everybody!

26:13.204 --> 26:16.741
Oh, it is so wonderful
to have you all here

26:16.841 --> 26:19.377
at the start of this
thrilling new venture.

26:19.477 --> 26:24.416
And I am extra excited
to be working alongside

26:24.516 --> 26:27.852
a woman who is often, well,
mistaken as my sister!

26:29.054 --> 26:30.889
Hence the name...

26:30.989 --> 26:32.924
"The Spencer Sisters"!

26:35.961 --> 26:37.262
Darby, come on up!

26:37.362 --> 26:39.097
Darby?

26:39.197 --> 26:40.699
Honey?

26:40.799 --> 26:42.934
Oh, uh, Darby?

26:44.102 --> 26:45.971
Where could she possibly be?

26:46.071 --> 26:48.006
Under here?
No?

26:48.106 --> 26:50.342
Darby, honey!
She's a little shy.

26:56.982 --> 26:58.216
Not much for speeches, huh?

26:58.316 --> 27:00.352
Wheat ale.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.721
My favourite.
Thank you.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.990
I should've known you'd find me.

27:05.090 --> 27:06.791
Yeah, I want to apologize.

27:06.891 --> 27:09.961
I should've checked to see
if it was cool that we came.

27:10.061 --> 27:11.062
No, it's okay.

27:11.162 --> 27:12.631
You have nothing
to apologize for.

27:12.731 --> 27:14.666
Yeah, it's one thing
to be in the same town,

27:14.766 --> 27:15.934
another to come to your house.

27:16.034 --> 27:19.971
Oh, this is very
clearly not my house.

27:20.071 --> 27:23.441
So, how's the new
business going?

27:23.541 --> 27:26.678
Well, my mom and I
argue about a lot.

27:26.778 --> 27:30.048
Like whether or not
she has boundary issues.

27:30.148 --> 27:32.584
Spoiler alert:
hard yes.

27:32.684 --> 27:35.286
I don't doubt that!

27:35.387 --> 27:36.821
What's the case
that you're working on?

27:36.921 --> 27:38.156
- Right now?
- Yeah.

27:38.256 --> 27:39.624
IP theft.

27:39.724 --> 27:41.326
Stolen tech for an app.

27:41.426 --> 27:44.029
The Luddite
is investigating technology?

27:44.129 --> 27:47.565
Hey, I prefer to identify
as technologically-challenged.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.566
Okay.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.368
No, the app's actually
pretty cool.

27:50.468 --> 27:53.171
It takes a bunch of your
health data and then determines

27:53.271 --> 27:54.673
if you need to see a doctor.

27:54.773 --> 27:55.740
That sounds...

27:55.840 --> 27:56.675
awful.

27:56.775 --> 27:58.009
What?
Why?

27:58.109 --> 28:02.247
Because patients get
so much bad information online.

28:02.347 --> 28:03.982
And doctors
need a lot of context

28:04.082 --> 28:07.185
to make a good diagnosis.

28:07.285 --> 28:09.988
There's just too many ways for
an app like that to go wrong.

28:10.088 --> 28:14.359
Hmm, I never thought
about it like that.

28:14.459 --> 28:15.827
Hey!

28:15.927 --> 28:16.828
Hi!

28:16.928 --> 28:18.129
Is this
a private party?

28:18.229 --> 28:19.164
No!

28:19.264 --> 28:20.465
No, not at all!

28:20.565 --> 28:23.735
Darby and Victoria were having
a, um, communication issue

28:23.835 --> 28:25.203
and, uh, she needed to get away.

28:25.303 --> 28:26.504
Yeah, you know how it is.

28:26.604 --> 28:27.539
Come in!

28:27.639 --> 28:29.974
You guys should
enjoy your drinks here.

28:30.075 --> 28:31.342
I have to run anyway.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.545
I have some work
to do on the app.

28:33.645 --> 28:34.979
I mean, the...

28:35.080 --> 28:38.717
Bye!

28:38.817 --> 28:40.051
Okay, have fun!

28:40.151 --> 28:41.953
Bye.

28:44.122 --> 28:45.990
I'm working on the cluster now.

28:46.091 --> 28:47.759
Yeah.

28:53.832 --> 28:56.701
Yeah, well, why don't
you call Elon to verify?

28:56.801 --> 28:59.404
No, tonight.

28:59.504 --> 29:00.438
Sorry about that.

29:00.538 --> 29:01.773
Elon?

29:01.873 --> 29:03.608
A different Elon.

29:03.708 --> 29:06.244
Please, sit.
Sit!

29:06.344 --> 29:07.779
What can I do for you?

29:07.879 --> 29:10.381
What does an IT consultant do, exactly?

29:10.482 --> 29:12.917
I, um...

29:13.017 --> 29:15.887
consult, you know?

29:17.522 --> 29:18.823
Okay.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.992
So, what can you
tell me about Triaj?

29:21.092 --> 29:22.093
Right...

29:22.193 --> 29:24.729
Well, I've been
going through what's left

29:24.829 --> 29:27.031
of the backup server.

29:27.132 --> 29:28.700
The coding files
are totally corrupted,

29:28.800 --> 29:31.736
but the testing logs
indicated that the app was,

29:31.836 --> 29:33.404
mmm, kind of unreliable.

29:33.505 --> 29:34.539
Unreliable?

29:34.639 --> 29:35.907
But they were about to launch.

29:36.007 --> 29:37.575
Well, most of the analysis
tested great,

29:37.675 --> 29:39.711
so heart stuff,
eye scan stuff,

29:39.811 --> 29:42.147
but anything
skin-related was glitchy.

29:42.247 --> 29:43.448
Give me an example?

29:43.548 --> 29:46.317
Okay, so out of the 300
random test subjects

29:46.417 --> 29:47.952
that uploaded a picture
of their birthmark...

29:48.052 --> 29:49.087
Mm-hm?

29:49.187 --> 29:52.023
The app flagged 296 of them
as likely melanoma.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.058
That is statistically impossible.

29:54.159 --> 29:57.228
So the app wasn't market-ready?

29:57.328 --> 29:58.730
That's being generous.

29:58.830 --> 30:01.132
And no one at Triaj said a word.

30:01.232 --> 30:02.767
Uh-uh.

30:32.363 --> 30:33.865
I'm trying to write!

30:33.965 --> 30:37.001
Oh, I'm sorry,
am I being extremely annoying

30:37.101 --> 30:39.237
first thing in the morning?

30:43.508 --> 30:46.344
I see you're
looking for a fight.

30:46.444 --> 30:49.614
Inviting Lucas to the party
was looking for a fight.

30:49.714 --> 30:50.815
You crossed a line.

30:50.915 --> 30:51.950
I threw a party.

30:52.050 --> 30:54.118
I didn't force anyone
to spend time together.

30:54.219 --> 30:56.788
If Lucas sought you out,
it's not on me.

30:56.888 --> 30:59.157
I'm not just your kid
moving back into your house.

30:59.257 --> 31:01.392
I'm a grown woman!
I have my own life.

31:01.492 --> 31:03.528
Okay, so this is
about the burrito?

31:03.628 --> 31:05.663
No, it's...

31:05.763 --> 31:06.931
Yes!

31:07.031 --> 31:10.501
It's about you not
respecting my boundaries.

31:10.602 --> 31:13.137
Okay, if we're talking
about boundaries,

31:13.238 --> 31:16.374
I need you to respect
my writing time!

31:16.474 --> 31:18.509
I need peace and quiet
to concentrate.

31:18.610 --> 31:22.313
After all, Bryn Martell still
pays the bills around here.

31:22.413 --> 31:24.515
Because you won't
charge our clients!

31:24.616 --> 31:26.017
Are we in business or not?

31:26.117 --> 31:27.118
Well, of course we are.

31:27.218 --> 31:29.053
Then why are you throwing
parties at the house

31:29.153 --> 31:31.890
while I'm out finding clues?

31:31.990 --> 31:33.892
Clues?

31:33.992 --> 31:37.161
What did you find out?

31:37.262 --> 31:40.398
Alastair was able to check
the test logs for Triaj.

31:40.498 --> 31:41.900
The app wasn't market-ready.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.735
But they were gonna
launch it tomorrow!

31:43.835 --> 31:45.036
Exactly.

31:45.136 --> 31:47.872
Maybe someone in the house
wanted to prevent that.

31:47.972 --> 31:50.708
Lee seemed to genuinely
need the app to succeed.

31:50.808 --> 31:51.743
Mm-hm.

31:51.843 --> 31:53.745
Clark, or Esme?

31:53.845 --> 31:55.113
Or the two of them together?

31:55.213 --> 31:57.415
You dig into Esme,
I'll take Clark.

31:57.515 --> 31:59.117
A break from my "sister"!

31:59.217 --> 32:00.919
Perfect.

32:01.019 --> 32:04.856
By the way, you owe me
300 bucks for that face cream.

32:04.956 --> 32:07.725
Who spends $300 on face cream?

32:07.825 --> 32:10.728
Someone who look fantastic,
that's who.

32:13.998 --> 32:16.034
You know,
all this video-gaming eludes me.

32:16.134 --> 32:18.569
Thank you for walking me
through this, Alastair.

32:18.670 --> 32:22.774
Yeah.
Yeah, happy to help.

32:22.874 --> 32:23.942
Are you okay?

32:24.042 --> 32:27.512
You seem a little, um... down.

32:27.612 --> 32:30.348
Oh, that's sweet.

32:30.448 --> 32:34.052
Just growing pains at home,
I think.

32:36.554 --> 32:37.488
Candy?

32:39.023 --> 32:40.925
These are
my absolute favourites!

32:41.025 --> 32:43.094
I've never seen them
outside of Portugal!

32:43.194 --> 32:44.762
Where did you find them?

32:44.862 --> 32:46.965
Oh, I got a...
I got a candy guy.

32:47.065 --> 32:48.099
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

32:48.199 --> 32:49.233
Can I take another?

32:49.334 --> 32:50.735
Take as many as you want!

32:50.835 --> 32:51.869
Thank you!

32:51.970 --> 32:55.273
Um, okay.
Uh, here we go.

32:55.373 --> 32:57.208
Here we go...

32:57.308 --> 32:59.844
Archived footage
from the time of the attack.

32:59.944 --> 33:01.512
If that mind flayer gets you,

33:01.612 --> 33:02.814
we're done for.

33:02.914 --> 33:04.582
[video] Just say you
need a bailout, Paladin.

33:04.682 --> 33:05.817
Stand back, boys.

33:05.917 --> 33:08.353
This is clearly a job
for me and my new battle axe.

33:08.453 --> 33:10.788
Okay, can you get me a better
view of what's happening?

33:10.888 --> 33:12.390
I can show you
different player POVs.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.624
This is Esme's.

33:13.725 --> 33:15.360
[video] All apps
come out with a few bugs.

33:15.460 --> 33:16.527
That's what updates are for.

33:16.627 --> 33:17.695
Isn't that right, Es?

33:17.795 --> 33:19.530
[video] That's what
you keep telling me!

33:19.630 --> 33:21.399
Hang on.

33:21.499 --> 33:22.967
[video] Did you guys
hear something?

33:23.067 --> 33:24.102
No.

33:24.202 --> 33:25.803
I'm gonna go check it out.

33:25.903 --> 33:28.272
[video] Okay, this mind
flayer is getting to me, man.

33:28.373 --> 33:30.575
-
- Es?

33:30.675 --> 33:32.110
Was that
Esme screaming?

33:32.210 --> 33:33.411
Es?

33:33.511 --> 33:35.213
Okay, if Clark is in on it,

33:35.313 --> 33:37.615
then he deserves
an Oscar for that performance.

33:37.715 --> 33:38.816
Take a look at Clark's POV.

33:38.916 --> 33:40.718
[video] Yeah, we were
working on it all night.

33:40.818 --> 33:42.153
- Needed a brain break.
- Wait, stop!

33:42.253 --> 33:42.987
Look at that.

33:43.087 --> 33:45.823
Replay it.

33:45.923 --> 33:47.725
[video] Yeah, we were
working on it all night.

33:47.825 --> 33:48.693
Needed a brain break.

33:48.793 --> 33:50.461
Look, Esme
turned her camera off

33:50.561 --> 33:51.963
and her character
is not moving.

33:52.063 --> 33:53.097
What are you thinking?

33:53.197 --> 33:54.532
She's away
from her keyboard.

33:54.632 --> 33:56.567
She wasn't playing...

33:56.667 --> 34:00.271
She was pretending to play.

34:07.278 --> 34:08.212
Hey!

34:08.312 --> 34:09.347
You survived the party.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.549
Yeah, by leaving it.

34:11.649 --> 34:13.284
We had fun.

34:13.384 --> 34:14.585
Good.

34:14.685 --> 34:17.622
So, can I ask you something?
It's for the case.

34:17.722 --> 34:21.292
I'm trying to verify
if an injury was legit.

34:21.392 --> 34:22.427
Sure.

34:22.527 --> 34:25.329
This is Esme,
and she said

34:25.430 --> 34:27.165
that she heard a noise
in the kitchen,

34:27.265 --> 34:28.766
so she went in to check it out,

34:28.866 --> 34:30.501
and someone hit her
on the forehead.

34:30.601 --> 34:34.072
And we think this was the weapon
because the bottom of it,

34:34.172 --> 34:37.141
the shape matches
the shape of the wound.

34:39.343 --> 34:40.578
No.

34:40.678 --> 34:42.113
No?

34:42.213 --> 34:43.781
No, the wound edge is diffuse.

34:43.881 --> 34:45.583
It didn't penetrate
the lower tissue.

34:45.683 --> 34:48.252
Okay, and for the non-MDs
in the house?

34:48.352 --> 34:50.121
It's a scrape.

34:50.221 --> 34:51.322
If someone took that pepper mill

34:51.422 --> 34:52.690
and brought it down
on her forehead,

34:52.790 --> 34:54.725
it would go through
several layers of tissue.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.194
Be more like a gouge.

34:56.294 --> 34:59.163
So then... what created that?

35:09.373 --> 35:11.476
Boom.

35:16.547 --> 35:21.219
Hold on, so you're saying
the wound is self-inflicted?

35:21.319 --> 35:25.289
She faked the attack?

35:25.389 --> 35:26.524
Looks like it.

35:28.059 --> 35:29.627
Sorry, guys.

35:29.727 --> 35:31.896
Look, I did all
that I could with this,

35:31.996 --> 35:34.665
but it's pretty much toast.

35:34.765 --> 35:37.435
So, why are we here?

35:37.535 --> 35:39.904
We wanted to meet you
without Esme.

35:40.004 --> 35:41.239
She faked her attack.

35:41.339 --> 35:42.907
What?
That's ridiculous.

35:43.007 --> 35:44.142
She pretended to keep playing

35:44.242 --> 35:46.644
and gave herself enough time
to hide the main server.

35:46.744 --> 35:48.312
And put the backup in the pool.

35:48.412 --> 35:49.714
No way!
She wouldn't do that.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.150
Okay, look, I know
you care a lot about Esme,

35:52.250 --> 35:54.252
but come on!
Think about it.

35:54.352 --> 35:59.190
Did Esme ever express concerns
about the app not working?

35:59.290 --> 36:02.426
She asked me to push the launch
by six months, but...

36:02.527 --> 36:03.494
I said no.

36:03.594 --> 36:05.363
Well, no,
she's an anxious person.

36:05.463 --> 36:06.964
She just wanted it
to be perfect.

36:07.064 --> 36:08.299
She wanted it to be safe.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.701
I was just...
too focused on the money.

36:10.801 --> 36:13.471
She stole the server
to prevent us from going live.

36:13.571 --> 36:15.139
Do you know where
she is right now?

36:15.239 --> 36:16.474
She had a doctor's appointment.

36:16.574 --> 36:18.743
Ah... Do you have
access to her emails?

36:18.843 --> 36:22.346
No, it's password-protected.

36:22.446 --> 36:26.150
Okay...

36:26.250 --> 36:29.020
"IT consultant," my ass.

36:33.291 --> 36:34.492
Look at that!

36:34.592 --> 36:38.229
Esme is planning to sell
the app to Monica Chandras!

36:38.329 --> 36:39.330
What for?

36:39.430 --> 36:41.032
Monica said she had
no interest in health care.

36:41.132 --> 36:43.100
But she was interested
in parts of Triaj.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.236
Maybe Esme was
trying to find a way

36:45.336 --> 36:47.071
to bail the three of you out.

36:47.171 --> 36:48.372
Yikes...

36:48.472 --> 36:50.775
One of the startups in Monica's
portfolio is Hass Systems.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.410
They sell and collect
people's information.

36:52.510 --> 36:55.012
All of our subscribers'
information was on that server.

36:55.112 --> 36:57.448
Well, isn't all of our
information out there anyway?

36:57.548 --> 36:58.649
- Hmm, no.
- No.

36:58.749 --> 36:59.850
Not retinal scans.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.686
That is highly sensitive
medical information

37:01.786 --> 37:03.788
that could be sold
to the highest bidder.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.557
And we just gave Hass
a whack of new inventory.

37:06.657 --> 37:08.993
Not if we can
get to Esme first...

37:09.093 --> 37:11.195
and stop that sale.

37:12.396 --> 37:12.563
are they?

37:14.632 --> 37:15.700
I don't know.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.468
This is where they
were supposed to meet.

37:17.568 --> 37:20.605
Ooh, it's your boyfriend--
ask him!

37:20.705 --> 37:26.177
Hello, have you seen
Monica Chandras?

37:26.277 --> 37:28.446
Well, she just left
for the airport.

37:28.546 --> 37:31.215
Was she with this woman?

37:31.315 --> 37:32.717
She may have been.

37:32.817 --> 37:34.719
Hmm, then we're too late.

37:34.819 --> 37:35.820
Not necessarily.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.655
There may be
another way to stop them.

37:37.755 --> 37:41.092
And believe it or not,
I actually want you to drive!

37:43.828 --> 37:46.564
And remember, I want
the money split three ways.

37:46.664 --> 37:49.066
Fine, whatever.

37:49.166 --> 37:50.401
You destroyed the backup?

37:50.501 --> 37:52.503
Yes.

37:52.603 --> 37:53.638
Pass me the server.

37:53.738 --> 37:57.541
I want to make sure
I have everything I need.

37:59.510 --> 38:01.712
I made a workflow plan
for the areas I think

38:01.812 --> 38:04.115
you'll need to focus on
to get everything working right.

38:04.215 --> 38:06.751
Fine, fine.

38:06.851 --> 38:10.354
Where's the retinal scan data?

38:10.454 --> 38:12.323
It's integrated with
the rest of the data.

38:12.423 --> 38:14.392
Just need the retinal scans.

38:14.492 --> 38:16.560
Show me.

38:24.435 --> 38:26.504
It's all there.
This is perfect.

38:26.604 --> 38:28.706
You're doing the right thing.
Your friends need the money.

38:28.806 --> 38:30.608
What the hell?

38:30.708 --> 38:32.710
Dmitri!

38:32.810 --> 38:35.713
A crazy woman
jammed on her brakes.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.318
You know,
I thought I saw a squirrel.

38:40.418 --> 38:42.353
And you know when
they run past your car

38:42.453 --> 38:43.788
and you're like, "Ahh!"?

38:43.888 --> 38:45.389
You ever the show
"World's Worst Driver"?

38:45.489 --> 38:46.991
My mom would've
killed on that show.

38:47.091 --> 38:48.059
Literally.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.493
Uh, what are you doing here?

38:49.593 --> 38:51.128
Monica's company
owns Hass Systems.

38:51.228 --> 38:52.663
She doesn't want to save Triaj,

38:52.763 --> 38:55.232
she wants all your subscribers
for their retinal scans.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.202
Oh my God!
What are we gonna do?

38:58.302 --> 38:59.704
What is happening?

38:59.804 --> 39:01.138
We have to go!

39:01.238 --> 39:02.573
Move your car.

39:02.673 --> 39:05.009
Hey, you know what, you're
the one that rear-ended me, so--

39:05.109 --> 39:06.143
You!

39:06.243 --> 39:08.212
What are you doing here?

39:08.312 --> 39:10.381
There isn't even any damage.

39:10.481 --> 39:11.582
We have a plane to catch.

39:11.682 --> 39:12.817
Esme, let's go!

39:12.917 --> 39:14.385
I changed my mind.

39:14.485 --> 39:17.421
I'm not selling.

39:17.521 --> 39:21.225
Well, too bad,
'cause a deal's a deal.

39:21.325 --> 39:22.793
Dmitri, let's go.

39:22.893 --> 39:24.462
Fine,
I'll move my car.

39:24.562 --> 39:26.931
Safe travels.
Sorry again.

39:41.011 --> 39:42.246
They still have our data!

39:42.346 --> 39:46.517
No, they don't.
I swapped it.

39:46.617 --> 39:49.387
They have the corrupted server.

39:56.293 --> 39:59.397
What the hell?

39:59.497 --> 40:01.932
Ugh!

40:02.032 --> 40:03.667
It's all good.
It's over.

40:03.768 --> 40:06.370
Ah...

40:06.470 --> 40:08.606
I really messed up.

40:08.706 --> 40:10.808
Clark and Lee are
never gonna forgive me.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.777
You never know.

40:12.877 --> 40:17.148
Your roommates might be more
understanding than you think.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.183
This is all so lovely,
but don't you think we should

40:19.283 --> 40:21.519
get out of here before
Monica and her goon get back?

40:21.619 --> 40:22.787
Come on, let's go!

40:22.887 --> 40:23.954
Yeah, let's go.

40:30.361 --> 40:31.829
So, are
you all moving out?

40:31.929 --> 40:32.830
Uh, no.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.532
Esme and I are gonna stay

40:34.632 --> 40:36.133
and we're gonna
rent out Lee's room.

40:36.233 --> 40:38.102
Oh!
How much is rent?

40:38.202 --> 40:40.204
I'm gonna crash
with my folks for a while,

40:40.304 --> 40:42.039
while I figure things out,
you know?

40:42.139 --> 40:43.774
What about Triaj?

40:43.874 --> 40:46.277
We'll all still work together.

40:46.377 --> 40:49.079
This time with
better communication.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.148
Smart.

40:51.248 --> 40:54.251
I'm sorry we can't
afford to pay you,

40:54.351 --> 40:56.187
but I really want
to thank you both.

40:56.287 --> 40:59.757
Without you, things would've
ended a lot differently.

41:02.226 --> 41:03.861
Call us if you need a website!

41:07.998 --> 41:09.600
Well, another case,

41:09.700 --> 41:12.837
another satisfied customer
too broke to pay their bill.

41:12.937 --> 41:15.372
Oh, I forgot to tell you,
Alastair paid our fee,

41:15.473 --> 41:16.707
$8,000.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.175
How?

41:18.275 --> 41:21.812
Best not to ask
too many questions.

41:21.912 --> 41:25.015
Mom, moving forward,

41:25.115 --> 41:27.852
I promise to respect
your writing time.

41:27.952 --> 41:31.889
And I promise to stop
messing with your love life.

41:31.989 --> 41:34.892
Or lack thereof.

41:34.992 --> 41:36.760
That's generous of you.

41:36.861 --> 41:37.895
Thank you.

41:37.995 --> 41:40.364
Oh, wait!
I want to show you something.

41:40.464 --> 41:42.633
Come here.

41:47.771 --> 41:50.341
Voilà!

41:50.441 --> 41:51.909
Your writing room!

41:52.009 --> 41:53.577
Mm-mm.
Our office!

41:53.677 --> 41:56.080
I had Rory redecorate it
while we were out.

41:56.180 --> 41:59.350
He repainted, brought in a new
desk, and rearranged things.

41:59.450 --> 42:01.352
I guess I should
have asked you first.

42:01.452 --> 42:02.920
No, that's okay.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.788
I know you want your own space,

42:04.889 --> 42:06.624
but I wanted us
to be close enough

42:06.724 --> 42:08.125
so that we could communicate.

42:08.225 --> 42:11.262
It's incredible.
Thanks, Mom.

42:11.362 --> 42:13.330
I'm glad you like it.

42:13.430 --> 42:15.966
I wanted it to feel
like home to us both.

42:16.066 --> 42:17.468
We should celebrate.

42:17.568 --> 42:18.869
Dinner's on me.

42:18.969 --> 42:20.771
I suppose you're
ordering takeout.

42:20.871 --> 42:22.973
Oh, definitely...
What do you want, burritos?

42:24.074 --> 42:25.609
And you wonder
why you break out.

42:25.709 --> 42:28.312
Guess I'll just have to start
using your fancy face cream.

42:28.412 --> 42:29.313
Uh-huh.

42:29.413 --> 42:31.248
You're gonna have to
replace it first!
