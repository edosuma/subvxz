00:01.040 --> 00:03.560
WOMAN: Last season
on A Place To Call Home...

00:06.040 --> 00:07.520
I love you with all my heart.

00:08.600 --> 00:09.760
Marry me.

00:10.760 --> 00:12.480
Yes.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.400
We're in love, Papa.
We're going to get married.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.680
I'm suggesting you let them
live together for three months

00:18.680 --> 00:20.480
as if they were married...
No. Impossible.

00:20.480 --> 00:22.680
..in every way except sharing a bed.

00:22.680 --> 00:25.520
Anna could move into your home
in a separate room

00:25.520 --> 00:27.520
and live the life of Gino's wife.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.800
While Anna lives with the Polettis

00:29.800 --> 00:33.000
testing her resolve
to marry inappropriately,

00:33.000 --> 00:35.920
you will spend three months
at Ash Park doing the same.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.480
Mother will do anything
to sabotage you.

00:39.480 --> 00:40.520
Let her.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.480
She's tough.
I'm tougher.

00:42.480 --> 00:46.600
I caught a glimpse last night
into the true nature of Sarah Adams.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.640
I saw a very dangerous woman.

00:48.640 --> 00:50.960
I don't care what it costs.

00:50.960 --> 00:54.280
Find something
that will rid us of her forever.

00:55.320 --> 00:59.240
The child I had, my darling,
it was you.

01:00.520 --> 01:03.960
Our situation is a complication
you don't need in the mix.

01:03.960 --> 01:06.400
I understand if you don't tell
the family just yet.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.520
I've come to talk
about our daughter.

01:12.520 --> 01:13.880
JAMES: I want you to cure me.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.240
MAN: I will need
your total commitment.

01:16.240 --> 01:17.240
You have it.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.880
OLIVIA: What if Dr Stewart
can't cure him?

01:19.880 --> 01:22.960
He just said that...
What if he can't?

01:22.960 --> 01:26.440
I'll still love him. Will you?

01:26.440 --> 01:27.880
What's it worth to you

01:27.880 --> 01:30.880
for the world not to find out
that your son's a queer?

01:33.080 --> 01:36.680
He's been seen with Harry Polson.
We're being blackmailed.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.320
You cross me on this...

01:39.520 --> 01:40.720
..you'll regret it.

Hiya. How is she?

Bright.

02:29.080 --> 02:31.760
Ah, here she is.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.240
How are you, Sarah?
Still here.

02:38.440 --> 02:40.080
Are you ready to get back into it?

02:41.400 --> 02:43.440
We left off so suddenly last time.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.040
Coffee and strudel?

02:45.040 --> 02:46.520
Ooh, thank you, Leah.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.640
Could you turn the radio off,
please?

02:51.240 --> 02:56.440
So, how is the writing going?
Good. I'm well into it.

02:57.680 --> 03:00.680
Um, I couldn't find anything
in the records

03:00.680 --> 03:02.240
about the body you mentioned.

03:02.240 --> 03:04.160
Body?

03:04.160 --> 03:07.480
Before we stopped,
you mentioned a body in the river.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.400
I couldn't find any record of it.

03:13.040 --> 03:15.880
You don't remember?
Body? No.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.800
So, where were we, apart from that?

03:18.800 --> 03:21.120
James had just started
his treatment.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.640
His torture.

03:26.320 --> 03:28.400
I can't believe
they actually used to do that.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.800
And worse.
All in the name of normalcy.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.960
How did Gran take it?
Poor Olivia.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.640
Soon with so many lies of her own.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.680
But that was later.

03:49.680 --> 03:53.760
Anna.
She was moving out to be with Gino.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.920
Ah, yes. Her new life.

03:56.960 --> 04:01.600
Such a confusing time,
losing a child and gaining a father.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.240
When did she find out
it was Jack Duncan?

04:04.240 --> 04:07.160
Oh, it was quite some time
before that happened.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.760
She had quite enough
to contend with as it was.

Before I forget,

04:21.800 --> 04:25.680
you didn't say what Roy felt
about you leaving the farm.

04:48.680 --> 04:50.680
How did Roy feel?
I heard you, dear.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.280
He was happy for me.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.960

05:15.960 --> 05:17.440
Yeah.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.360

so much a part of the future.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.920

Wait!

05:37.320 --> 05:38.520
We had a child?

05:40.320 --> 05:41.960
You left me.
I had no choice.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.480
I don't see you for 20 years...
I know.

05:43.480 --> 05:45.040
..and you turn up like this.
I'm sorry.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.880
Our daughter?
I'm trying to do the right thing.

05:47.880 --> 05:49.600

Both of us.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.600
Right.

There were reasons I never told you,
but I am trying to fix it.

I...I...

05:58.880 --> 06:00.760
Well, is she here? Overseas?
I can't tell you.

06:00.760 --> 06:01.880
Why?
Not yet.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.320
Why not?!
It's difficult.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.480
So, why now?

06:07.480 --> 06:10.400
She's just found out about me...

06:11.400 --> 06:13.760

before she asks about her father.

I may be of assistance,

07:25.400 --> 07:27.840
Well, you've heard the news,
I assume.

07:29.160 --> 07:30.400
About Anna.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.960
I make it my business
never to listen to tittle-tattle.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.640
Oh, that they were more like you.

Is there a problem?

07:40.480 --> 07:42.120
Oh, not at all, no.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.160
Anna's moved in with the Polettis
for a period.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.480
But they're Italian.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.520
Unorthodox.
Unorthodox.

07:47.520 --> 07:50.480
She has her heart set on Italy
for the northern summer.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.240
She and Carla are very close

07:52.240 --> 07:54.160
so what better way
to learn the language?

07:54.160 --> 07:55.440
I see.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.600
But there is an unmarried son
in the house

07:57.600 --> 08:00.600
and baser minds may see gossip
where there is none.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.280
No!
Sadly.

08:03.680 --> 08:06.680
As a mother of sorts
to two young girls,

08:06.680 --> 08:08.960
I understand the importance
of protecting their reputation.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.960
If I hear any scurrilous rumours...

08:10.960 --> 08:12.200

you should see Anna's dresses.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.800
They don't fit in the wardrobe.

three dresses are enough -

08:33.520 --> 08:35.480
two for everyday and one for church.

Is she not staying?

09:39.960 --> 09:41.760
Of course.
Indeed.

Will wonders never cease?
I hope not.

That's what fathers do.

Nothing.

Five minutes?

11:16.800 --> 11:20.320
See if you can remember what
you were going to tell me about Roy.

11:22.160 --> 11:23.320
Hi. It's Sam.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.960
Roy, what's the matter?

12:45.974 --> 12:48.694
I thought
our communicating by telephone

12:48.694 --> 12:51.694
was simply
a necessarily evil consequence

12:51.694 --> 12:53.214
of your living in the city.

12:54.254 --> 12:56.614
Clearly,
you simply prefer the separation.

division follows.

that encourages skulking.

Oh, spare me the metaphors.

13:22.694 --> 13:25.774
I'm doing what I must
to protect us all.

13:25.774 --> 13:28.854
From what?
The woman's influence.

13:29.854 --> 13:32.334
You'll end up with no-one
if you're not careful.

13:32.334 --> 13:35.054
Then what's left for you to protect?

13:35.054 --> 13:36.374
Our good name...

13:37.414 --> 13:39.614

seem intent on ruining.

to any flames whilst you're here,

14:41.694 --> 14:43.694
Are you right with what we've done?

14:46.614 --> 14:48.574
We saved more lives
from being ruined.

14:50.614 --> 14:52.094
You know the alternative.

you want to tell me.

15:05.414 --> 15:07.774
I do keep rambling back to it.

15:09.854 --> 15:13.414
Talking to you has unearthed
so many ghosts.

disposed of the body.

15:35.694 --> 15:37.334

Roy? No, no, someone else.
Someone we needed to protect.

15:41.134 --> 15:43.134
Who?

15:45.774 --> 15:47.694
You can't just tell me
about a murder...

to ask that at the loony bin.

Sorry. Um, I was just passing.

16:11.494 --> 16:14.014
You seem to be heading towards,
not past.

A friend from London.

16:17.494 --> 16:21.894
She lives here now
and she has a nervous complaint.

I didn't think you had friends
in Australia.

16:27.934 --> 16:29.694
An old school friend.

16:29.694 --> 16:32.054
Well, I'm checking up on father.
He's drying out.

16:32.054 --> 16:34.014
Oh, I didn't...
Look, don't feel uncomfortable.

16:34.014 --> 16:36.934
The lecherous old reprobate has
forfeited his right to discretion.

16:38.454 --> 16:42.614
Well, I won't keep you.
Wish him my best.

16:42.614 --> 16:43.974
What are you doing in the city?

16:43.974 --> 16:49.174
Um...James and I
are spending time here.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.974
A holiday of sorts.

16:50.974 --> 16:52.334
And where's he?

16:52.334 --> 16:54.454
James? At the hotel.

16:56.654 --> 17:00.494
You really should visit Anna,
you know.

17:00.494 --> 17:01.734
She'd love to see you.

17:01.734 --> 17:04.814
Really?
Of course.

17:04.814 --> 17:07.814
Without us at Ash Park,
she'd relish the company.

17:07.814 --> 17:09.854
I have been thinking of her lately.

17:10.973 --> 17:12.013
I won't detain you.

17:13.374 --> 17:14.614
Give James my best.

17:48.214 --> 17:49.934
How are you feeling, my darling?

17:51.374 --> 17:52.494
I think...

17:54.974 --> 17:57.414
I don't know what...

18:01.654 --> 18:03.814
I hate seeing you like this.

18:06.654 --> 18:08.334
Come back to me.

18:11.134 --> 18:12.854
Who are you?

18:14.654 --> 18:17.854
If you don't want
to do this anymore,

18:17.854 --> 18:20.014
you just say.

18:20.014 --> 18:22.534
Do you hear me?

18:22.534 --> 18:26.614
If it gets too much, just say.

18:26.614 --> 18:28.574
Ah, we're awake.

18:28.574 --> 18:30.974
How are we feeling, James?

18:30.974 --> 18:33.374
Foggy.
Mm-hm.

18:33.374 --> 18:36.094
You must be Mrs Bligh.
I'm Dr Wilson.

18:36.094 --> 18:38.454
I oversee James's daily treatment.

18:38.454 --> 18:40.414
I thought Dr Stewart was in charge.

18:40.414 --> 18:43.494
Rest assured,
I work closely with Dr Stewart.

18:43.494 --> 18:46.654
I specialise
in this particular form of deviancy.

18:46.654 --> 18:49.694
His memory still isn't back.

18:49.694 --> 18:51.694
Is that normal?
It is.

18:51.694 --> 18:53.854
Are you ready
for your next treatment, old man?

18:54.814 --> 18:57.054
But he's barely rested
from the last.

18:57.054 --> 18:58.294
Mrs Bligh...

18:58.294 --> 19:01.734
Shouldn't you at least wait
until he's himself again?

19:01.734 --> 19:03.894
Being himself
is precisely the problem.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.654
This is the treatment.

19:05.654 --> 19:07.374
This is what Dr Stewart
discussed with you.

19:07.374 --> 19:08.934
Yes, but...
James trusts me.

19:08.934 --> 19:10.214
Don't you, James?

19:10.214 --> 19:12.014
Yes.

19:13.214 --> 19:16.414
So, if you could wait outside,
we'll talk in a moment.

19:26.614 --> 19:27.934
Livy.

19:29.254 --> 19:32.734
Excuse me,
I'm meeting Mrs James Bligh here.

19:32.734 --> 19:35.694
I was hoping you might tell me
where I could find her.

19:49.054 --> 19:53.054
Ah, Doctor, a moment, if I may.
Rather not.

19:53.054 --> 19:56.974
There's an issue of some import
I wish to canvass with you, Doctor.

19:56.974 --> 20:01.054
No doubt you saw me arrive earlier
in the Bligh car.

20:01.054 --> 20:02.174
I didn't.

20:02.174 --> 20:05.974
Oh, well, I'm sure
the staff was abuzz

20:05.974 --> 20:08.734
and I would hate the girls to think
I'm somehow above them

20:08.734 --> 20:10.294
after the experience.

20:10.294 --> 20:13.694
Rest assured,
I'm still the same Doris Collins.

20:13.694 --> 20:16.374
I must say, even Norman
seemed a little disconcerted

20:16.374 --> 20:18.774
to be addressed so openly
from the rear seat.

20:18.774 --> 20:21.094
One imagines
he's unused to passengers

20:21.094 --> 20:22.694
bridging the social divide,

20:22.694 --> 20:25.614
but front seat or back,
I'm the same woman.

20:25.614 --> 20:27.014
Doctor?

20:41.414 --> 20:43.854
I was starting to give up on you.
I'm not here to chat.

20:44.894 --> 20:46.054
Please, can't we just...?

20:46.054 --> 20:47.774
What happens if she doesn't want
to know about me?

20:47.774 --> 20:49.214
If she doesn't ask?

20:50.774 --> 20:52.014
Come inside. Let me get you a drink.

20:52.014 --> 20:55.294
I'm teetotal, which you'd know if
you hadn't ignored me for 20 years.

20:55.294 --> 20:57.254
I'm sure she will ask.

20:57.254 --> 21:00.014
If she doesn't,
what will you tell her?

21:00.014 --> 21:01.334
Will you tell her about me anyway?

21:04.134 --> 21:05.254
That's what I thought.

21:05.254 --> 21:07.694
It's not that simple.
She has a father.

21:07.694 --> 21:08.814
Damn right she does! Me!

21:08.814 --> 21:10.974
She comes first.

21:10.974 --> 21:13.494
If she asks, I will tell her,
but if she doesn't...

21:13.494 --> 21:15.214
You made me miss her whole life!

21:16.334 --> 21:19.014
Then you hold her in front of me
and tell me maybe I can't have it.

21:19.014 --> 21:20.334
No, I don't need your permission.

21:20.334 --> 21:22.294
Jack!
You can shove your bloody offer.

21:22.294 --> 21:24.494
Can we just...?
Wherever she is, I'll find her.

21:24.494 --> 21:26.094
I will find her.

21:57.674 --> 22:00.794
You'll be here, of course,
when Sarah arrives.

22:00.794 --> 22:02.594
Naturally.

22:04.154 --> 22:05.234
Naturally.

22:07.074 --> 22:09.474
I think it's best
Anna is left to her own devices,

22:09.474 --> 22:11.234
for a few days at least.

22:11.234 --> 22:12.954
I agree.

22:12.954 --> 22:16.234
I've already taken steps
to quash gossip on both accounts.

22:16.234 --> 22:17.754
Good.

22:17.754 --> 22:20.074
(CLOCK CHIMES)

22:20.074 --> 22:21.234
Well, excuse me.

22:22.754 --> 22:24.474
When did you intend telling me?

22:25.514 --> 22:26.554
What?

22:26.554 --> 22:28.594
About your sister.

22:40.674 --> 22:41.954
George!

22:45.314 --> 22:46.874
Well, if you're here to see Sarah,

22:46.874 --> 22:48.554
you have a strange way
of showing it.

22:48.554 --> 22:50.794
You didn't tell mother, did you?
No, no, no.

22:50.794 --> 22:52.954
I was quick enough on my feet
to cover for you.

22:52.954 --> 22:55.994
Assuming it's Anna you're here for.
Yes.

22:55.994 --> 22:57.754
I should have guessed
with all the trips to the city.

22:57.754 --> 22:59.314
She's been talking to you
about Gino.

22:59.314 --> 23:01.154
You know about him?
I do now.

23:02.474 --> 23:05.514
She needed someone.
I'm glad it was you.

23:06.434 --> 23:08.594
I've been so caught up
in my own problems, I didn't see it.

23:08.594 --> 23:12.114
She loves him.
Yes.

23:12.114 --> 23:13.354
Have you been to the farm?

23:14.634 --> 23:17.954
Mother didn't tell you?
Tell me what?

23:17.954 --> 23:19.954
Anna's living with the Polettis
for three months.

23:19.954 --> 23:22.754
(GASPS) She's...?
We struck a deal.

23:22.754 --> 23:25.834
She's there to get a taste
of married life.

23:25.834 --> 23:28.914
Separate beds, I assume.
Only you would ask that.

23:28.914 --> 23:31.474
If they can make it work,
they have my blessing.

23:31.474 --> 23:33.874
I'm impressed.
It was Sarah's idea.

23:33.874 --> 23:35.594
But you agreed to it.

23:35.594 --> 23:37.154
I like your Sarah.

23:37.154 --> 23:39.234
You'd like her even more
when you meet her.

23:39.234 --> 23:41.554
Being there for Anna's taken
all my attention,

23:41.554 --> 23:43.354
but I promise I will make up for it.

23:45.594 --> 23:49.594
It must be hard sometimes,
being Aunt Carolyn.

23:52.954 --> 23:54.314
It's the price I pay.

24:03.194 --> 24:06.754
What are you doing?
What are YOU doing?

24:06.754 --> 24:10.514
Turns out that a French polish isn't
compatible with doing the dishes.

24:10.514 --> 24:14.074
(SPEAKS ITALIAN)
They're just nails.

24:14.074 --> 24:15.234
Well, they're beautiful.

24:16.434 --> 24:19.314
And I love you for doing this.

24:19.314 --> 24:20.874
Gino!

24:23.434 --> 24:25.754
Gino's kissing Anna!
Hey, get out of here!

24:25.754 --> 24:26.954
Gino's kissing Anna!

24:26.954 --> 24:28.234
Get out of here!
Please get out.

24:28.234 --> 24:29.834
Mamma! Mamma! Gino's kissing Anna!

24:29.834 --> 24:31.314
No, we weren't.

24:31.314 --> 24:34.714
(ALL SPEAK ITALIAN)

24:34.714 --> 24:35.834
I didn't do anything!

(ALL SPEAK ITALIAN)

24:43.834 --> 24:44.874
Sit.

24:49.514 --> 24:52.194
We have one rule - no touching.

24:52.194 --> 24:53.914
You touch, she goes.
Mamma, please...

24:53.914 --> 24:55.354
"Mamma," nothing.

24:55.354 --> 24:57.034
Anna, to the kitchen.

25:02.114 --> 25:03.954
Your papa is right.

25:05.154 --> 25:08.674
A man controls himself.
A decent man.

25:09.914 --> 25:11.314
Hmm?
Si.

25:12.554 --> 25:13.674
Si.

25:27.754 --> 25:29.874
Thought I saw you arrive.

25:29.874 --> 25:32.074
Where's James?
In his treatment.

25:32.074 --> 25:34.154
He has it in the afternoon.

25:34.154 --> 25:35.994
Twice a day now.

25:35.994 --> 25:38.154
That's too much.
Mrs Bligh.

25:38.154 --> 25:40.114
It is too much.

25:41.274 --> 25:43.154
Mrs Bligh, I'm afraid
I'm going to have to ask you

25:43.154 --> 25:44.274
to stay away for a while.

25:44.274 --> 25:45.274
No!

25:45.274 --> 25:48.194
Any progress we make with James, you
undo with your displays of distress.

25:48.194 --> 25:49.354
I don't!

25:49.354 --> 25:51.274
You fret over him,
aggravating his fears,

25:51.274 --> 25:52.834
making treatment nigh on impossible.

25:52.834 --> 25:55.314
You are counter-productive
to his health

25:55.314 --> 25:58.514
and your own,
not to mention the unborn.

26:01.234 --> 26:06.034
Do you want James cured
of this perversion or not?

26:07.034 --> 26:08.274
I...

26:11.954 --> 26:13.714
I want him better.

26:13.714 --> 26:17.594
Then we will review the advisability
of you visiting him in a few weeks.

26:17.594 --> 26:19.514
But Dr Stewart said...

26:19.514 --> 26:21.034
He's in complete agreement.

26:26.034 --> 26:27.354
Excellent.

27:03.994 --> 27:06.194
Not exactly the sort of farewell
I wanted for you.

27:07.234 --> 27:08.474
Me neither.

27:10.434 --> 27:11.994
You look after her, Mr Bligh.

27:13.234 --> 27:15.154
Don't worry. She's in good hands.

27:15.154 --> 27:16.354
(DOG BARKS)

27:16.354 --> 27:18.074
Just like he is.

27:18.074 --> 27:20.594
Looks like you'll have two old dogs
to come visit, eh?

27:32.194 --> 27:33.834
If you can't live with it...

27:33.834 --> 27:35.194
I will.

28:37.554 --> 28:39.594
Oh, it was kind of you to meet me,
Mrs Bligh.

28:39.594 --> 28:41.874
The least any guest can expect.

28:41.874 --> 28:44.194
The grey room for Miss Adams,
I think, Amy.

28:44.194 --> 28:45.194
Yes, Mrs Bligh.

28:45.194 --> 28:46.954
Actually, Amy,
Anna offered her room.

28:46.954 --> 28:49.274
It'll be much nicer.
Yes, sir.

28:49.274 --> 28:50.794
But who knows when she'll be back.

28:50.794 --> 28:52.074
No, the grey room, Amy.

28:52.074 --> 28:53.834
Anna's determined
to stay the course.

28:53.834 --> 28:56.194
Best err on the side of caution.

28:56.194 --> 28:58.794
Sarah's more than a guest.
And will be treated accordingly.

thank you.

I can't believe I'm actually here.

29:12.274 --> 29:14.234
I want Ash Park
to feel like your home.

29:15.634 --> 29:17.594
This is home.

It's hardly our most luxurious
accommodation.

I think it's perfect.

you'll be in with me.

Do you think George will be hurt?

31:23.415 --> 31:26.095
He is still your father.
But he won't be.

31:26.095 --> 31:27.855
No.

31:31.255 --> 31:34.895
And your real father?
You're not curious?

31:34.895 --> 31:36.255
Of course.

31:38.695 --> 31:40.455
It's complex enough already.

31:57.095 --> 31:58.575
JAMES: Hey.

32:02.535 --> 32:05.375
You're back with us.
You're doing very well, James.

32:05.375 --> 32:08.615
Where...where's Livy?

32:08.615 --> 32:11.455
Mrs Bligh won't be with us
for some time.

32:12.375 --> 32:16.055
Thought it best that you have
some peace and quiet to recover

32:16.055 --> 32:18.735
and to allow the treatment
the best chance of success.

32:19.815 --> 32:21.295
It's what you want, isn't it?

32:22.535 --> 32:24.615
To enjoy your wife and your family

32:24.615 --> 32:26.535
without the spectre of perversion
hovering?

32:26.535 --> 32:28.335
My head hurts.

32:28.335 --> 32:32.695
We're making you better
and that's what we want.

32:32.695 --> 32:33.695
Yes?

32:40.615 --> 32:43.175
We're on voltage two at the moment.
We'll take it up to five.

33:38.615 --> 33:40.775
WOMAN: Just down here to the right,
Mr Richards.

34:26.895 --> 34:29.895
Oh, Miss Adams! More than punctual.

34:29.895 --> 34:32.135
I hoped we might talk before dinner.

34:34.614 --> 34:36.054
I come in peace.

34:37.614 --> 34:40.614
We both know that you'll try
to stop this marriage

34:40.614 --> 34:42.534
and we also know
I'm not about to let you.

34:43.735 --> 34:45.815
So, this is your line
drawn in the sand?

34:45.815 --> 34:49.094
More our Geneva Convention.
Oh, your rules of engagement.

34:49.094 --> 34:50.255
A rule.

34:51.895 --> 34:54.614
Whatever blows we land,
we leave George out of it.

34:55.695 --> 34:58.895
We both love him.
We don't want him hurt.

34:58.895 --> 35:00.055
Agreed.

35:00.055 --> 35:01.335
Thank you.

35:01.335 --> 35:03.695
Although we did make an agreement
once before.

35:03.695 --> 35:05.735
James.
Yes.

35:07.015 --> 35:08.895
Break this one at your peril.

35:09.975 --> 35:13.695
Sherry?
Thank you.

35:16.615 --> 35:20.255
Anna should do that.
Ma, she's tired.

35:20.255 --> 35:24.215
A farmer's wife doesn't rest
so SHE doesn't rest.

35:24.215 --> 35:25.815
Ma!

35:47.855 --> 35:49.095
(WHISPERS) Ma...

35:50.255 --> 35:51.655
..let her sleep.

35:51.655 --> 35:53.095
Tonight.

35:54.175 --> 35:55.535
Tomorrow, dishes.

36:03.375 --> 36:05.135
Now, I hope you won't mind

36:05.135 --> 36:08.015
if I leave you both alone
for a few days.

36:08.015 --> 36:09.055
Where are you going?

36:09.055 --> 36:11.015
I'd like to visit James and Olivia

36:11.015 --> 36:13.335
so I intend to leave
on Sunday after Matins,

36:13.335 --> 36:14.855
unless you have any objections.

36:14.855 --> 36:16.695
No, no. By all means.

36:16.695 --> 36:19.655
I thought not.
It's not your heart, is it?

36:19.655 --> 36:21.975
Oh, don't be so dramatic, George.

36:21.975 --> 36:24.655
Although I do intend
to see my specialist.

36:24.655 --> 36:27.175
I thought Miss Adams might like
the chance to settle in,

36:27.175 --> 36:28.535
to adjust.

36:28.535 --> 36:30.095
That's very thoughtful.

36:31.775 --> 36:33.255
Well, it's been a long day.

36:33.255 --> 36:34.415
If you'll excuse me.

36:36.015 --> 36:37.935
Goodnight, Miss Adams.
Goodnight.

36:37.935 --> 36:39.535
Goodnight, mother.
Goodnight, George.

36:45.135 --> 36:46.975
That's the last thing I expected.

37:00.855 --> 37:02.775
Yes, I'd like to make
a long-distance call

37:02.775 --> 37:04.775
to Sydney, please, Mildred.

37:04.775 --> 37:06.175
To the Australia Hotel.

37:07.895 --> 37:08.935
Mm-hm.

37:08.935 --> 37:13.655
And I want to speak to a guest,
Mrs Regina Standish.

37:15.295 --> 37:17.495
There are things I haven't told you.

37:19.375 --> 37:23.055
Mother has reason
to be concerned about James.

37:25.215 --> 37:28.295
Best you settle before I burden you
with family problems.

37:28.295 --> 37:31.015
When it's right.
Soon.

37:32.735 --> 37:35.855
And then, no secrets between us...

37:36.855 --> 37:37.975
..ever.

37:44.575 --> 37:46.935
I had to lie.

37:46.935 --> 37:49.055
I had no choice.

37:52.775 --> 37:54.935
That's enough for today.
It's getting late.

37:56.575 --> 37:58.655
So many secrets.

37:59.935 --> 38:03.375
Did you finally tell him?
Never about the murder.

38:05.335 --> 38:07.975
Other secrets refused
to stay silent.

38:09.735 --> 38:11.935
Even some I didn't know myself.

38:25.039 --> 38:28.239
Bye, Samantha.
Bye, Leah. Thank you.

38:31.599 --> 38:33.639
She told me
something extraordinary...

38:34.799 --> 38:36.039
..in confidence.

38:36.039 --> 38:38.479
She's led an extraordinary life.

38:39.799 --> 38:41.959
Just hope my book
can do her justice.

38:41.959 --> 38:42.999
See you.
