WEBVTT

00:04.587 --> 00:06.798
You get into, like, this mood,
and we can all feel it.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.508
I feel like I’m carrying more
than my load.

00:08.550 --> 00:10.260
I feel that it’s
the other way around.

00:10.301 --> 00:13.263
I don’t wanna leave
anyone high and dry, but...

00:13.304 --> 00:14.347
-No, that...
-I’m telling you right now.

00:14.389 --> 00:15.849
-Yeah.
-Bring someone else in.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.350
I didn’t plan on ever
quitting or whatever,

00:17.392 --> 00:18.977
but it’s like [bleep].

00:19.019 --> 00:21.563
I feel closer to the fish in
the water than the deck crew.

00:21.604 --> 00:24.691
Jason, you’ve always
been awesome on deck,

00:24.733 --> 00:26.192
and I found someone.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.570
He’ll be here before
the next charter.

00:28.611 --> 00:30.030
What the hell?

00:30.071 --> 00:32.407
We already have so much
of all this.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.039
I think Natalya wants
to be the chief stew,

00:39.080 --> 00:42.167
and she just tries
to make me look bad.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.585
Oh [bleep], I’m exhausted.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.921
Please, can you do
eight tequila shots?

00:46.963 --> 00:47.922
-Okay.
-Guys?

00:47.964 --> 00:49.299
Yes?

00:49.341 --> 00:50.717
Mzi really needed help
lifting that stuff down.

00:50.759 --> 00:53.011
No...

00:53.053 --> 00:54.554
Bullsh--.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.306
I wanna put some sort of,
like, lead position in my team,

00:56.348 --> 00:58.725
and I’ve got a very good
friend working really hard,

00:58.767 --> 01:00.060
and then I had Courtney
come in and just

01:00.101 --> 01:01.269
completely blow me away.

01:01.311 --> 01:02.479
For that reason,
I wanna go with her.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.980
Yeah.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.149
Are you guys nervous about
who’s gonna join your team?

01:11.738 --> 01:13.531
I’ve gotta have
this conversation tonight.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.991
What convo?

01:15.033 --> 01:17.577
[bleep] it, like,
why not tonight?

01:17.619 --> 01:19.245
Right now is not
the time or place.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.373
Both of you have
absolutely killed it.

01:21.414 --> 01:23.625
I’d like to make you
my lead deckhand.

01:23.667 --> 01:26.586
Holy sh--, like,
what is going on?

01:26.628 --> 01:27.796
Thank you, I appreciate it
so much.

01:27.837 --> 01:28.922
I love you.

01:28.963 --> 01:30.507
It is quite disappointing.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.720
No, it’s not while
you’re out of work hours.

01:43.853 --> 01:46.564
I can’t take you anymore,
----ing hell.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.233
Just get the [bleep]
out of my life.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.651
Storm.

01:58.993 --> 02:00.912
Oh, my God,
the anxiety, man.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.333
Okay.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.210
Honestly, he’s the most
dramatic person.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.758
You are not, though, Storm.

02:18.513 --> 02:19.639
look like anything.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.715
Why didn’t he say goodbye?

02:53.757 --> 02:55.342
Right, leave him to it,
it’s fine.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.515
This is the worst night yet.

03:02.557 --> 03:05.226
Like, everything’s
just everywhere, it sucks.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.521
Hey, enjoy your food?

03:08.563 --> 03:10.065
He’s getting too dramatic.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.192
By the way, my food is
delicious, is anyone else’s?

03:12.233 --> 03:13.568
Me, too.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.986
Same, I’m, like, living
my best life right now.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.197
-Nat.
-Is it me?

03:17.238 --> 03:18.698
No, don’t ----ing...

03:18.740 --> 03:20.658
I’m just telling him
not to stress.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.369
I know, but...

03:25.038 --> 03:26.748
Guys, just saying
if anybody wants it,

03:26.790 --> 03:27.999
I bought it for anyone.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.000
Oh, my God, yeah.

03:31.086 --> 03:32.587
We’re gonna have onion
breath all night now.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.713
And it just squirted on me.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.423
No one’s picking up tonight.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.735
How are your shoes?

03:55.777 --> 03:57.195
Are they dry?

03:57.237 --> 03:58.738
Yeah, of course they’re dry.
Give me your right foot.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.282
Okay, I’m dying.

04:01.324 --> 04:04.202
As much as Dave and
I have our problems,

04:04.244 --> 04:06.705
he is still like a friend.

04:08.665 --> 04:11.543
My boyfriend clearly
wants me to be away from Dave.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.591
But I can’t, because
I have to work with him.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.760
That’s the worst
part about yachting...

04:20.802 --> 04:22.971
you just have to put
your work life first.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.476
Night.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.440
-To the next spot.
-To the next spot!

04:33.481 --> 04:35.942
It is the very last night...
I’m done.

04:35.984 --> 04:37.652
So, I’m pumped.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.779
Okay, we’re going.

04:39.821 --> 04:41.573
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.074
Wait, I’ve got Prince Charming
here putting my shoes...

04:43.116 --> 04:44.367
Come on, guys.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.368
I’m putting my shoes on.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.786
Oh, my God, old couple.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.622
I’m in the corner.

04:49.664 --> 04:50.790
I’m in the front.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.133
Is it just us three, darling?

05:00.175 --> 05:01.843
The interior dream team.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.511
Here we are.

05:03.553 --> 05:07.015
Honestly, I’m so glad I’ve got
you two, because [bleep] that.

05:10.769 --> 05:13.271
I connect with Kyle, I just
can’t connect with Natasha.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.856
I’ve really tried.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.650
Although, like, I feel
like she’s not a chief stew.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.110
You or Kyle would
run it better.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.614
What are we drinking?

05:22.655 --> 05:26.242
Anything heavy and flowy
and loud and let’s do it.

05:26.284 --> 05:28.078
Woo!

05:28.119 --> 05:29.371
Oh, wow.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.959
That lead deckhand situation,

05:35.001 --> 05:37.671
it’s a little bit
soul-destroying.

05:37.712 --> 05:39.339
But at the same time,

05:39.381 --> 05:42.676
I think Courtney’s happiness
here overrides my sadness.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.314
Woo-hoo!

05:56.356 --> 05:58.942
Yes!

05:58.983 --> 06:01.653
[screaming]

06:03.863 --> 06:05.448
[snoring]

06:05.490 --> 06:07.200
Oh, whoa!

06:07.242 --> 06:08.910
Yes, girl.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.546
Ah, there we go.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.717
Oh, mate.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.886
Yeah. Work it.
Woo-hoo!

06:32.267 --> 06:33.768
Hey?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.917
What?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.550
[sobbing]

07:21.274 --> 07:22.776
Yeah, let’s go home.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.111
Fine, yeah, we’ll go, we
just need to wait for Tash.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.446
Wait, where is she?

07:26.488 --> 07:27.822
She’s in the bathroom
over there.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.203
[sobbing]

07:33.244 --> 07:34.454
What time is it?

07:34.496 --> 07:35.955
It’s time for me to push out.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.546
I know, I know.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.759
[sobbing]

07:49.594 --> 07:51.096
-Have we got everything?
-Mm-hmm.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.598
-I’ve got Kyle’s bag.
-All right, thank you.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.497
Coming up...

08:17.539 --> 08:19.290
<i>I think the new</i>
<i>deckie’s arriving.</i>

08:19.332 --> 08:21.001
Oh, guys, he’s gonna be gay.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.252
Rawr!

08:27.048 --> 08:28.049
Mother----er.

08:28.091 --> 08:29.676
Do not say "the head
of housekeeping

08:29.718 --> 08:30.969
wasn’t able to get
to your cabin today."

08:31.011 --> 08:32.345
Do not go and try to blame me.

08:32.387 --> 08:33.930
Time management.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.432
If you think you’re gonna
come for me like you come

08:51.114 --> 08:53.074
[sobbing]

09:03.877 --> 09:05.462
No, no more.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.630
I need to calm down before I go
out, because I don’t wanna...

09:07.672 --> 09:09.758
That’s fine, you can calm down.

09:09.799 --> 09:11.301
Here we go.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.683
Let’s go.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.688
I don’t know if I might have
your eyelash on my cheek.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.774
-No.
-Okay, thank God.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.950
I’ve always been in
really long-term relationships.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.827
I get attached
to people very easily.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.371
I don’t know how to be alone,

09:39.412 --> 09:42.582
so I’ve never really
experienced being single.

09:42.624 --> 09:46.920
I would put all my time and
energy into that one person,

09:46.961 --> 09:50.632
and just make
them feel so loved.

09:50.674 --> 09:53.385
And I guess I want
that feeling back.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.680
* Tell me something *

09:58.682 --> 10:00.016
Ah!

10:02.060 --> 10:04.312
-Oh, I love a boat ride.
-I know.

10:06.523 --> 10:08.316
Straight to the crew mess,
straight to the fridge,

10:08.358 --> 10:11.486
-straight to the snacks.
-Straight to the choccies.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.446
-Oh, hello, Storm.
-Hello.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.326
Let’s rock, bitches.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.667
Storm’s quite an
emotional drinker.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.336
He’s upset and he’s hurt,
but there’s no reason

10:28.378 --> 10:30.505
to literally storm off
from a table.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.007
He causes his own drama.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.134
Like, there’s a lot better
ways to manage things.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.677
Now I’m just over it.

10:35.719 --> 10:38.555
I’m not chasing anyone down
beaches or bars anymore.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.390
Night, guys.

10:40.432 --> 10:41.891
Oh, straight to bed.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.242
Jason?

11:05.915 --> 11:07.250
Okay, we got lines?

11:07.292 --> 11:09.544
Find my shoes...
hey, Courts.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.129
Morning, there’s some in there.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.173
I’m being promoted
to lead deckhand,

11:13.214 --> 11:15.633
which is amazing,
and I’m, like, so excited.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.093
But also, like,
I almost feel bad

11:17.135 --> 11:18.887
because of the whole
Mzi situation.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.430
I don’t think
Mzi actually cares.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.349
Like, I don’t think his ego
is hurt or anything.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.059
Like, I think he’s
fine, because...

11:25.143 --> 11:26.686
well, yeah, I don’t know.

11:26.728 --> 11:27.854
I don’t know.

11:31.941 --> 11:33.568
You all right?

11:33.610 --> 11:34.986
I’m good, how are you doing?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.404
-All right.
-That’s good.

11:36.446 --> 11:37.697
Ah, this weather!

11:37.739 --> 11:39.282
Yeah, it’s been
raining all night.

11:39.324 --> 11:40.867
-Yeah.
-Okay.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.995
-Hey.
-Hi.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.455
-You all right?
-How are you?

11:45.497 --> 11:46.873
Good.

11:49.125 --> 11:52.837
Deck crew, deck crew,
we are going back to the dock.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.964
It’s going to start
pouring on you guys.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.305
All right, copy, Captain.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.265
Coffee.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.937
Ugh!

12:08.978 --> 12:10.689
-Good morning.
-Hey, good morning.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.065
We’re gonna move.

12:13.316 --> 12:15.568
Okay. Will you put
these clothes on?

12:15.610 --> 12:16.861
Thank you.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.113
Let’s just do
everything together.

12:19.239 --> 12:20.990
Why, can’t you do
things alone?

12:26.287 --> 12:28.081
I mean, if we were running
the boat the way

12:28.123 --> 12:30.917
that Natalya’s running the boat,
we would have no guests.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.794
We’re just making sure
that the laundry’s all good

12:32.836 --> 12:35.130
and we have a place to sleep
in the guest beds at times.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.924
But yeah, tell me more
about your problems.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.515
A bit of both.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.525
You can start hauling
the anchor.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.118
Thank you.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.786
----ing cold, eh?

13:06.828 --> 13:08.788
Not a vibe.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.249
Can you maybe just
start unraveling the fenders,

13:11.291 --> 13:13.460
-so we can get them?
-Yep.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.420
ETA, 38 minutes.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.173
Do you wanna launch
into the master?

13:18.214 --> 13:19.674
Sure, I’ll do that for you.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.051
Thanks, my love.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.889
Gotta dock in the rain now.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.057
This one here?

13:34.856 --> 13:37.359
You really... you’re stuck.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.735
Oh!

13:38.777 --> 13:40.362
-You’re stuck in--
-Do you guys have any spray?

13:40.403 --> 13:41.863
You’re like a Hobbit.
You’re like a Dement...

13:41.905 --> 13:43.365
you’re like a Dementor,
like a moth.

13:43.406 --> 13:45.158
-Have you seen Tash?
-You’re a big, giant moth.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.502
<i>All right, I’m on</i>
<i>the port side, okay?</i>

13:55.543 --> 13:56.628
<i>Yeah, copy that.</i>

14:00.340 --> 14:02.384
You’re gonna do the spring
lines first this time.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.760
Yeah.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.512
<i>Your stern is all clear.</i>

14:20.527 --> 14:22.153
<i>Jason, can you lock off</i>
<i>on the bow, please?</i>

14:22.195 --> 14:23.655
<i>Please lock off on the bow.</i>

14:23.697 --> 14:26.866
Copy port, starboard’s
getting locked off now.

14:26.908 --> 14:28.284
Okay, Court first.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.414
<i>Good job.</i>

14:32.455 --> 14:33.623
Good?

14:33.665 --> 14:35.750
Yeah, we’re good,
we can lock this off.

14:35.792 --> 14:36.918
Thank you.

14:36.960 --> 14:38.086
<i>Good job, dude.</i>

14:40.171 --> 14:41.339
I love the smell
of toilet cleaner.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.299
Ugh, it’s so good, me too.

14:45.385 --> 14:46.302
Nat.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.263
-Are you off?
-Yeah, I’m off.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.222
Goodbye!

14:49.264 --> 14:50.432
It was great hanging.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.307
I’m out.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.727
Okay, honey.
Lucky you.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.478
Come give Dad a hug.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.813
Goodbye, babe.

14:56.855 --> 14:58.398
I’ll be seeing you in Miami.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.485
Really enjoyed
meeting you guys.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.281
You did not!

15:06.322 --> 15:07.824
Be true to yourselves,
that’s all I can say.

15:07.866 --> 15:08.950
And be true to you.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.994
How do guys pack so lightly?

15:15.040 --> 15:16.207
-Hey.
-Hi, Captain Sandy.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.625
-You headed out?
-I just wanted to...

15:17.667 --> 15:19.336
yeah, I just wanted to
say I’m heading out.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.254
That’s pretty awesome,
with the toenails.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.506
Unfortunately,
it’s pretty consistent.

15:23.548 --> 15:24.424
I love it.

15:24.466 --> 15:25.633
-So...
-It was a pleasure.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.427
-You have my number.
-Yes, I do.

15:27.469 --> 15:28.428
I’ll text you, just to
make sure you’ve got my...

15:28.470 --> 15:29.637
-Okay.
-Yeah, awesome.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.014
So, if an Indiana number
comes through...

15:31.056 --> 15:32.307
-Okay.
-Well, text me your name.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.683
-Yeah, of course.
-That way, I know.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.143
Absolutely.

15:35.185 --> 15:36.478
-Thanks again, Captain Sandy.
-Yeah, thank you.

15:36.519 --> 15:38.313
I’m looking forward
to going home.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.898
But I’m actually really sad
that I’m leaving

15:39.939 --> 15:42.650
because it’s not what
I planned or expected.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.903
But when it comes to
my place on the deck crew,

15:44.944 --> 15:50.825
you’ve got three friends
and you’ve got one outsider.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.744
Unfortunately, that’s me.

15:52.786 --> 15:56.247
That’s actually really sad, to
actually hear the emotion in me.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.707
Thank you, my man.
I appreciate it, dude.

15:57.749 --> 15:58.708
-Cheers.
-Thanks, buddy.

15:58.750 --> 15:59.834
Travel safe.

15:59.876 --> 16:00.835
-Cheers, J.
-Cheers, guys.

16:00.877 --> 16:01.836
Bye!

16:01.878 --> 16:03.672
Oh, the emotional part.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.142
All right, I’m gonna
go get the crew mess rubbish,

16:16.184 --> 16:17.644
because it’s full.

16:17.686 --> 16:18.853
Cool, and then we’ll get
the rubbish from the bar.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.647
Yeah.

16:20.689 --> 16:22.774
-You’re rubbish from the bar.
-You’re rubbish from the bar.

16:25.402 --> 16:28.029
David, Natasha, Storm,
meet me in the crew mess.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.865
-Copy.
-Copy.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.742
Charter number seven.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.202
The cool thing is,

16:34.244 --> 16:36.705
co-primary charter guests
are repeat clients.

16:36.746 --> 16:37.956
Oh, yay.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.417
Jonathan DePaz
and Eric Cotson.

16:40.458 --> 16:43.670
Eric, where did all of
these remote vibrators...

16:43.712 --> 16:45.213
I get the pink one.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.590
-Oh, mine just woke up.
-Woo!

16:47.632 --> 16:49.968
Eric is an entrepreneur
who has successfully retired

16:50.010 --> 16:51.386
at the age of 59.

16:51.428 --> 16:53.555
Jonathan is a personal trainer
in Los Angeles

16:53.596 --> 16:55.223
and loves traveling
the world.

16:55.265 --> 16:56.766
Eric and Jonathan will
be accompanied

16:56.808 --> 16:59.561
by Jonathan’s clients,
Hannah, Amanda, and Brett.

16:59.602 --> 17:00.812
It looks like they’re gonna
want a lot

17:00.854 --> 17:02.355
of healthy, nutritious food.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.607
Diana’s extremely
particular about cleanliness.

17:04.649 --> 17:08.486
She has to have her cabin
spotless at all times.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.405
Amanda is a
professional dominatrix

17:10.447 --> 17:14.242
and is looking forward
to having a BDSM-themed evening

17:14.284 --> 17:17.037
with all of her friends...
wow.

17:17.078 --> 17:18.246
That’s interesting.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.582
What’s "BDSM?"

17:20.623 --> 17:25.003
It’s like leather and dominating
and masks and straps and swings.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.755
Oh, God.

17:26.796 --> 17:31.259
People think of yachts
as elegant and posh,

17:31.301 --> 17:34.220
whatever, but this
theme is quite seedy.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.181
Oh, my God.

17:36.222 --> 17:38.058
This is gonna be
an awesome charter.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.185
As long as we do what we’ve been
doing, I reckon it’ll be great.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.770
All right, everyone,
thank you.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.104
-Thanks, Cap.
-Thank you, Sandy.

17:43.146 --> 17:44.272
Thanks, Sandy.

17:44.314 --> 17:47.150
Okay, trash, done.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.527
Covers, still on because
it’s still raining.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.490
<i>I think the new</i>
<i>deckie’s arriving.</i>

17:56.284 --> 17:57.243
Excited for, like, a newbie?

17:57.285 --> 17:58.661
Yeah.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.330
For this next charter,
it’s more pressure

18:00.372 --> 18:01.956
because it’s my first one
as lead deckhand.

18:01.998 --> 18:06.252
Please, Lord, can
the new deckhand be helpful,

18:06.294 --> 18:10.590
good at his job,
and good-looking.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.097
Coming up...

18:17.138 --> 18:18.473
It’s just hard for me right
now, because, like,

18:18.515 --> 18:19.808
we have such a good time
on this boat,

18:19.849 --> 18:21.267
and then, like, as soon as
we get out there

18:21.309 --> 18:22.435
and there’s drinking involved,

18:22.477 --> 18:24.187
it becomes a bit
heavy too quickly.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.281
She’s a pretty piece of work.

18:37.701 --> 18:38.993
No way.

18:44.541 --> 18:46.376
-Hey.
-Hey, Captain, how are you?

18:46.418 --> 18:48.128
How are you?
Welcome aboard.

18:48.169 --> 18:49.337
-Reid Jenkins.
-Nice to meet you.

18:49.379 --> 18:50.839
Pleasure to meet you.

18:50.880 --> 18:53.508
Storm, Storm, to the bridge,
Storm, to the bridge.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.051
How was your trip?

18:55.093 --> 18:57.429
Eighteen hours of flying,
but glad to be here.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.305
Nice and jet-lagged for
your first day of charter?

18:59.347 --> 19:00.348
Whew.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.058
Hello.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.935
-Hey, how you doing, I’m Reid.
-Storm, nice to meet you, mate.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.895
Pleasure to meet you.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.230
Awesome.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.732
Dude, are your bags on board?

19:08.773 --> 19:10.567
Yes, I just dropped one bag off
on the main deck aft.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.110
-You’ve just got one?
-Yeah.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.738
We gotta meet in the main salon
in our uniforms at 11:55.

19:14.779 --> 19:15.905
Oh, wow, okay.

19:15.947 --> 19:17.532
Yeah, we’ve got less
than an hour.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.075
-Okay, then.
-So, let’s get cracking, eh?

19:19.117 --> 19:21.077
Awesome, thank you, it was
a pleasure to meet you.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.454
Yeah, you too.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.247
-Hi.
-Hey.

19:24.289 --> 19:27.250
I’m Captain Kyle,
nice to meet you.

19:27.292 --> 19:28.418
-Courts, this is Reid.
-Hi.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.753
This is our...
she’s our lead.

19:29.794 --> 19:30.962
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure to meet you.

19:31.004 --> 19:32.130
Dave is your roommate.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.965
-Hi, Reid.
-Hey, Dave.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.050
Dave, nice to meet you.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.385
Oh, wow.
This is pretty.

19:37.427 --> 19:38.511
All right, Mzi,
this is Reid.

19:38.553 --> 19:39.929
-Nice to meet you.
-Welcome!

19:39.971 --> 19:41.222
We’ve taken care of you
and sorted you out.

19:41.264 --> 19:42.223
Sorted your uniform out.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.224
Oh, cool.

19:43.266 --> 19:44.642
Kyle.

19:49.147 --> 19:53.151
I grew up in Decatur, Alabama,
and it’s just a small town,

19:53.193 --> 19:56.363
small-town charm,
but it didn’t give you

19:56.404 --> 19:59.366
a lot of opportunity to
excel and stand out.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.950
I graduated from the
University of Alabama.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.702
I am a fourth
generation graduate.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.496
I should have said Roll Tide.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.039
So, I should have said
I graduated

20:06.081 --> 20:09.000
from the University of
Alabama in 2019, Roll Tide.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.423
Hi, Rich.

20:15.465 --> 20:17.425
Is it possible to
get some Veuve champagne,

20:17.467 --> 20:18.843
get, like, eight bottles?

20:21.930 --> 20:23.390
Thank you so much.

20:30.647 --> 20:32.357
Nat, how you feeling?

20:32.399 --> 20:34.442
Not amazing.
Why’d you leave?

20:34.484 --> 20:37.112
Because I needed to
go back to the boat.

20:39.364 --> 20:40.573
Obviously I know
you’re pissed off at me

20:40.615 --> 20:42.951
for the whole situation--

20:42.992 --> 20:44.327
It was just in
front of everyone.

20:44.369 --> 20:45.995
We were this close
to each other,

20:46.037 --> 20:47.706
having a private conversation
that no one else was a part of.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.790
It was supposed to be a
fun thing

20:48.832 --> 20:50.333
that turned into
a sh---show, so.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.419
It’s just hard for me
right now, because, like,

20:52.460 --> 20:54.087
we have such a good time
on this boat,

20:54.129 --> 20:55.755
and I’m, like so excited
to see you every day,

20:55.797 --> 20:57.340
and as soon as we get out
there

20:57.382 --> 20:59.009
and there’s drinking involved
and stuff, it just...

20:59.050 --> 21:01.594
it just becomes a vibe that
I don’t wanna

21:01.636 --> 21:03.054
be around at the time.

21:03.096 --> 21:05.849
Because it just becomes a
bit heavy too quickly.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.893
This is just too much.
I’m being honest at the moment.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.062
I know pretty quickly
if I love someone.

21:11.104 --> 21:14.232
Like, I’m like, yeah,
that’s my energy, they match it.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.193
But I see Storm as a friend
that I would love,

21:17.235 --> 21:19.070
maybe not a boyfriend.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.031
If I don’t see them being,
like, the father of my children,

21:21.072 --> 21:23.033
then, like, I just don’t see
the point in dating them.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.702
Yeah, all right, well, it’s the
last thing that I wanted to do,

21:25.744 --> 21:27.328
is to make you feel
a certain way.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.913
Have a good day.

21:52.937 --> 21:55.273
We can just wash these bits,
do you know what I mean?

21:55.315 --> 21:57.025
I’ll just start rinsing.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.364
All crew, all crew,
we have provisions on the dock.

22:02.405 --> 22:03.531
<i>Yeah, coming up.</i>

22:05.617 --> 22:06.701
Oh sh-- this looks heavy.

22:06.743 --> 22:07.786
Oh, my God, Courtney.

22:07.827 --> 22:08.995
Oh, are you all right?

22:09.037 --> 22:09.996
----ing help!

22:10.038 --> 22:11.706
-Pantry counter?
-Right over here.

22:11.748 --> 22:12.957
-Right here?
-Okay, go.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.209
-Got it?
-Yeah.

22:20.507 --> 22:22.133
-I can’t deal.
-Me, either.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.052
This sh-- drives me up
the absolute wall.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.097
And that’s a nice way
to put it.

22:27.138 --> 22:29.057
-Tell me what you need.
-Oh, there’s more beer.

22:29.099 --> 22:31.142
Oh, now we’ve
got all the wines.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.024
Okay.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.442
I might put these
in the hallway,

22:39.484 --> 22:40.777
because they were
really expensive.

22:40.819 --> 22:41.778
Yes.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.659
Ridiculous... like, this
was zero when we arrived.

22:53.623 --> 22:55.333
What’s going on?

22:55.375 --> 22:56.501
Well, if you’ve seen the laz...

22:56.543 --> 22:57.919
No.

22:57.961 --> 23:00.422
There’s, like, what,
80 bottles of wine.

23:00.463 --> 23:01.923
What’s the problem?

23:15.061 --> 23:17.147
Jeez, I got out of the South,
I thought that I was away

23:17.188 --> 23:19.566
from the humidity for
at least a little while.

23:19.607 --> 23:20.608
It’s so humid here.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.068
Sh--, dude.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.820
Where do y’all store covers,
all in there?

23:23.862 --> 23:25.030
Yeah, in these lockers, yeah.

23:25.071 --> 23:25.864
Okay.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.323
I’m gonna be honest...

23:27.365 --> 23:29.492
one of my best friends,
she said,

23:29.534 --> 23:31.411
"Reid, when you first
get on the boat,

23:31.453 --> 23:32.746
keep your head down and
your mouth shut

23:32.787 --> 23:34.289
and don’t piss anybody off."

23:34.330 --> 23:36.750
Because for whatever reason,
I’m just really good

23:36.791 --> 23:38.168
at shoving my foot in my mouth.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.919
What was the story
with the other guy?

23:39.961 --> 23:41.296
Oh, um...

23:48.720 --> 23:51.348
Sometimes I say or do something,
I just feel nervous.

23:51.389 --> 23:53.683
I feel like I need to fit in,
I need to crack a joke

23:53.725 --> 23:55.226
to come off as funny,

23:55.268 --> 23:58.521
and I always end up doing
something wrong to someone.

23:58.563 --> 24:00.523
I have a sh-- sense of humor.

24:00.565 --> 24:02.525
Only person that thinks
I’m funny is me.

24:02.567 --> 24:04.694
Well, I’m thankful to be here,

24:04.736 --> 24:06.029
at least for
a little while, you know?

24:06.071 --> 24:07.989
Tash, your laundry has arrived.

24:08.031 --> 24:10.408
-Laundry’s here.
-Oh, my God.

24:10.450 --> 24:13.161
Kyle, Kyle, are you free to
help me with all the linen?

24:13.203 --> 24:14.913
There’s, like, six bags.

24:17.749 --> 24:19.376
-Priorities right now.
-Yeah, I mean...

24:19.417 --> 24:20.710
It’s, like, setting
a table

24:20.752 --> 24:21.711
or getting all the
provisions freaking on.

24:21.753 --> 24:22.796
Where does it go?

24:22.837 --> 24:24.589
Just the main salon

24:26.800 --> 24:28.093
We’re out of space.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.763
Oh, I don’t want
that down there.

24:31.805 --> 24:32.764
-Who told you that?
-Tash.

24:32.806 --> 24:33.973
That goes in pantry.

24:36.101 --> 24:37.268
I know, but it goes in the...

24:39.312 --> 24:40.855
Nat, you’re gonna have
to calm down,

24:40.897 --> 24:42.273
the way you’re
speaking to people.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.234
The way I speak?
I didn’t say anything to you.

24:44.275 --> 24:45.735
Just don’t give me
sh-- now, okay?

24:45.777 --> 24:47.237
I can’t be bothered.

24:47.278 --> 24:48.613
I’m gonna speak to her,
I’m ready to go off.

24:48.655 --> 24:51.449
Like, sorry, I’m going in hot.

24:51.491 --> 24:52.617
Tash?

24:58.039 --> 24:59.332
Calm the what down,
the way I speak?

24:59.374 --> 25:01.042
I didn’t say anything
to you, Tash.

25:01.084 --> 25:02.252
Nat, you’re just a
bit snappy with everyone.

25:02.293 --> 25:03.795
A bit snappy?

25:03.837 --> 25:05.088
Tash, there’s about five boxes
of each beers down there.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.423
They are obviously annoyed,

25:06.464 --> 25:08.174
because then now
they’re backtracked,

25:08.216 --> 25:09.592
because they’re trying...
I feel bad, there’s...

25:09.634 --> 25:10.760
And this is where people
need to help me,

25:10.802 --> 25:12.387
because
I can’t do everything.

25:12.429 --> 25:13.722
Yeah, but you need to delegate.

25:13.763 --> 25:14.806
And, like, this here,
just getting it--

25:14.848 --> 25:16.141
I am delegating...

25:16.182 --> 25:17.434
Kyle’s setting
the table right now.

25:17.475 --> 25:18.727
That doesn’t need to be done.

25:18.768 --> 25:19.769
And I asked the deck crew
to help us

25:19.811 --> 25:21.396
because they’re finished.

25:21.438 --> 25:22.814
They can’t help us,
Tash, because you’ve literally

25:22.856 --> 25:23.940
ordered about six kinds
of each thing

25:23.982 --> 25:24.983
and they’ve got no space for it.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.401
Don’t speak to me like that.

25:26.443 --> 25:27.610
I haven’t spoken to you
in any way, Tash.

25:27.652 --> 25:29.279
No, don’t disrespect me.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.031
-That’s just being ridiculous.
-I don’t stand for that.

25:31.072 --> 25:32.699
It’s disrespectful to speak
to someone like that.

25:42.292 --> 25:43.293
Kyle’s setting
the table right now.

25:44.919 --> 25:46.421
That doesn’t need
to be done right now.

25:46.463 --> 25:47.505
I told them to come and help.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.174
They can’t help us, Tash,

25:49.215 --> 25:50.508
because you’ve literally ordered
about six kinds of each thing

25:50.550 --> 25:51.676
and they’ve got no space for it.

25:51.718 --> 25:52.927
Don’t speak to me like that.

25:52.969 --> 25:54.012
I haven’t spoken
to you in any way, Tash.

25:54.054 --> 25:55.680
No, don’t disrespect me.

25:55.722 --> 25:56.973
-That’s just being ridiculous.
-I don’t stand for that.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.808
Do not shout at me.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.854
I need the fresh air.

26:02.896 --> 26:05.315
-Told you, ticking time bomb.
-Yeah.

26:15.867 --> 26:17.160
Let me hear what happened.

26:17.202 --> 26:18.703
No, I can’t be spoken
to like that.

26:18.745 --> 26:20.372
I can see your face
has gone down, hon.

26:20.413 --> 26:22.248
No, I treat people the way
that I wanna be treated.

26:22.290 --> 26:24.584
Tash, I’m right here,
and you keep--

26:24.626 --> 26:27.253
Yes, Nat, you can’t speak to me
like that, it’s really rude.

26:27.295 --> 26:28.880
Speak what, Tash? I’ve not
spoken to anyone saying...

26:28.922 --> 26:29.881
I was even yelling.

26:29.923 --> 26:31.257
Just stop shouting at me,

26:31.299 --> 26:32.467
I can’t be dealing with that
right now.

26:32.509 --> 26:33.885
No one is shouting at you.

26:33.927 --> 26:35.470
If you wanna hear shouting,
then I’ll shout.

26:35.512 --> 26:36.680
You’re meant to be supporting
me, not shouting at me.

26:36.721 --> 26:37.847
No one is shouting at you.

26:37.889 --> 26:39.349
If you wanna have
a conversation,

26:39.391 --> 26:40.892
don’t bring it up with Kyle,
be a chief stew...

26:40.934 --> 26:41.935
You come down to the crew mess,
screaming at me.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.145
I did not scream at you.

26:44.187 --> 26:45.563
This is so frustrating.
If you wanna have a chat...

26:45.605 --> 26:47.065
I don’t need people screaming
at me right now.

26:47.107 --> 26:48.191
Tash, if you wanna have
a chat with me,

26:48.233 --> 26:49.567
then take it somewhere private.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.236
Don’t bring it up with Kyle.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.863
-No one is shouting at you.
-You’re shouting at me now.

26:53.905 --> 26:55.907
She’s trying to make me
look bad at my job,

26:55.949 --> 26:57.534
and I’m not bad at my job.

26:57.575 --> 27:00.328
I’ve done this for 10 years.
I know what I’m doing.

27:00.370 --> 27:03.039
Don’t bitch and moan
about me to everyone else.

27:03.081 --> 27:06.793
I am her boss,
and she’s really pissing me off.

27:06.835 --> 27:08.503
Like, she’s not respecting me.

27:08.545 --> 27:10.422
And next time, Tash,
I would appreciate it

27:10.463 --> 27:12.966
if you spoke to me and
not everybody else.

27:15.844 --> 27:18.805
We’re gonna take a second.

27:18.847 --> 27:21.266
Mm.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.892
It’s all right,
I won’t bring you into it.

27:22.934 --> 27:25.687
Me?
[laughing]

27:25.729 --> 27:28.732
Ain’t nobody can get me down.

27:28.773 --> 27:30.233
<i>All crew, all crew,</i>

27:30.275 --> 27:33.778
let’s be in our whites in
the main salon at 12:25.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.488
-Copy for deck.
-Copy that.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.618
-Are we all running?
-Yeah, we’re all running.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.454
Oh, no!

27:42.495 --> 27:45.165
Hello, my angel of peace,
serenity.

27:47.625 --> 27:50.587
<i>The boat looks pristine,</i>
<i>really good job.</i>

27:50.628 --> 27:51.921
Let’s go to the dock.

27:51.963 --> 27:54.924
Let’s go, sun’s out, buns out.

27:54.966 --> 27:56.092
The weather looks nice now.

27:56.134 --> 27:57.552
It’s quite nice.

27:57.594 --> 27:59.179
The guests are actually
walking up to us right now.

28:00.889 --> 28:03.308
-Here we go.
-Hey.

28:03.350 --> 28:04.517
Welcome back.

28:04.559 --> 28:05.810
-Hey, it’s great to see you.
-You too.

28:05.852 --> 28:06.895
David, nice to meet you.

28:06.936 --> 28:08.146
David, nice to meet you, David.

28:08.188 --> 28:09.189
-Hi, Natasha, nice to meet you.
-How you doing?

28:09.230 --> 28:10.482
-Hi, Diana.
-Natalya.

28:10.523 --> 28:11.858
Natalya...
wait a minute, Natalya...

28:11.900 --> 28:13.443
-Natasha...
-Tasha, Nat, Tasha, Nat.

28:13.485 --> 28:14.611
Excellent.

28:14.652 --> 28:16.071
Welcome back,
it’s good to have you.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.655
Thank you, it’s good
to be back.

28:17.697 --> 28:19.449
Different boat, our chief stew’s
gonna show you around,

28:19.491 --> 28:20.658
and then we’ll get your luggage
on board and underway.

28:20.700 --> 28:21.951
Great stuff.

28:21.993 --> 28:23.495
-Follow me.
-Here we are, cold towel.

28:23.536 --> 28:24.662
Oh, thank you very much.

28:24.704 --> 28:25.830
-Champagne, babe?
-Thank you.

28:25.872 --> 28:26.998
You’re welcome.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.583
-Salute.
-Cheers.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.336
-We’re here!
-We made it, oh, my God!

28:31.378 --> 28:32.712
-She’s a dominatrix, yeah.
-Oh, really?

28:32.754 --> 28:34.005
Yeah.

28:34.047 --> 28:35.757
Tomorrow night,
there’s a BDSM party.

28:35.799 --> 28:37.425
What we’re gonna do is we’re
gonna wrap your face in leather,

28:37.467 --> 28:38.635
and Amanda’s gonna do
what she wants to you.

28:38.677 --> 28:40.970
Um...

28:42.305 --> 28:44.849
So, this is
the bridge deck aft.

28:44.891 --> 28:46.893
This is where most
of the meals will be.

28:46.935 --> 28:48.353
That’s cool.

28:48.395 --> 28:49.604
And then we go this way,
where you guys

28:49.646 --> 28:51.648
will probably chill and party.

28:53.108 --> 28:55.360
-And tan, yeah.
-Yeah.

28:55.402 --> 28:56.569
How are we doing this, just
walking it straight on, or...

28:56.611 --> 28:57.570
-Yeah.
-Okay.

28:57.612 --> 28:59.406
Whoa, a lot of sh--.

29:01.199 --> 29:04.202
-So, here’s the Jacuzzi.
-Ooh, cozy Jacuzzi.

29:04.244 --> 29:05.495
I love this.
Oh, this is great.

29:05.537 --> 29:06.496
It’s beautiful.

29:06.538 --> 29:07.539
-Ooh.
-Yeah.

29:07.580 --> 29:08.957
You can see right
out to the bow.

29:08.998 --> 29:11.042
You can actually sit
in those two seats

29:11.084 --> 29:12.585
-while we’re moving.
-Oh, really?

29:12.627 --> 29:14.462
That sounds fun!

29:14.504 --> 29:16.256
I just wanna get everything
on board as soon as we can.

29:16.297 --> 29:18.675
Jesus, brü, this must
be the dominatrix stuff.

29:18.717 --> 29:20.301
-Sh--.
-Holy sh--!

29:20.343 --> 29:24.973
Look at the lighting
in here, so modern.

29:25.015 --> 29:26.224
And here we have
the owner’s suite.

29:26.266 --> 29:27.559
This whole thing
is the master suite?

29:27.600 --> 29:29.019
-Interesting toilet.
-Why is it interesting?

29:29.060 --> 29:30.353
It washes, it dries, it does...

29:30.395 --> 29:31.563
Oh, it’s a Toto,
I have those in my home.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.106
It does everything.

29:33.148 --> 29:34.315
You think sensual thoughts,
you can orgasm on your toilet.

29:34.357 --> 29:35.692
-Oh, my God.
-TMI.

29:35.734 --> 29:37.736
See, this one’s way heavier.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.070
Some of them are quite heavy.

29:39.112 --> 29:40.071
A lot of photography equipment.

29:40.113 --> 29:41.197
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

29:41.239 --> 29:42.574
-Nice.
-Are you a photographer?

29:42.615 --> 29:43.658
I am.

29:43.700 --> 29:44.951
Oh, wow...

29:44.993 --> 29:45.952
I mean, not, like,
a paid one or anything.

29:45.994 --> 29:47.454
<i>All the luggage is in.</i>

29:47.495 --> 29:48.705
-When we’re leaving...
-Yeah.

29:48.747 --> 29:50.081
You’re gonna stand up here

29:50.123 --> 29:51.249
and you’re gonna look
at Captain Sandy.

29:51.291 --> 29:52.459
I will be calling
from the stern.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.626
Yeah.

29:53.668 --> 29:55.045
You’re gonna do your
black lines first.

29:55.086 --> 29:56.046
-Yeah, blacks and yellows.
-Yeah.

29:56.087 --> 29:57.422
All good.

29:57.464 --> 29:58.840
And she’ll also tell
you what you need to do.

29:58.882 --> 30:00.216
-Okay.
-All right, I got it, man.

30:00.258 --> 30:01.634
So, this is the prep,
but not the galley.

30:01.676 --> 30:03.303
-The galley’s down below.
-Correct, the...

30:03.345 --> 30:05.096
no, the galley’s
right over there.

30:05.138 --> 30:06.264
Hey, John, you wanna
see the galley?

30:06.306 --> 30:07.640
Here.

30:07.682 --> 30:08.641
Howdy.

30:08.683 --> 30:09.851
Oh, how we doing?

30:09.893 --> 30:11.644
-Is this lunch?
-It is lunch, yeah.

30:11.686 --> 30:14.272
These are all prepped for sous
vide cooking, it looks like.

30:14.314 --> 30:16.524
Can you guys do, like,
a sea bass baked in salt?

30:16.566 --> 30:17.817
A whole sea bass?

30:17.859 --> 30:19.611
Because it’s perfect,
just, it looks nice...

30:19.652 --> 30:21.613
Yeah, I know how to
do salt-baked fish.

30:21.654 --> 30:22.947
And it’s perfect.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.157
It seems to me like
David can do anything.

30:24.199 --> 30:25.408
-That would be great.
-Anything.

30:25.450 --> 30:26.951
No worries.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.286
Awesome, well, I’m looking
forward to eat your cooking.

30:28.328 --> 30:29.496
The last time,
the chef was excellent.

30:29.537 --> 30:30.330
We had great food.

30:30.372 --> 30:32.415
We’re really big foodies.

30:32.457 --> 30:34.292
All right, once they
have the onion on top,

30:34.334 --> 30:35.460
then they can go, okay?

30:35.502 --> 30:36.294
Fabulous.

30:36.336 --> 30:37.754
Thank you... wow.

30:37.796 --> 30:41.174
We have a roast Wagyu
fillet with braised cheek.

30:41.216 --> 30:43.093
-Mm!
-Oh, my God.

30:43.134 --> 30:44.636
-The chef’s really good.
-Mm.

30:44.678 --> 30:46.179
I’m really looking
forward to it.

30:46.221 --> 30:47.472
Fingers crossed...

30:47.514 --> 30:50.141
The chef last time
was amazing, by the way.

30:50.183 --> 30:51.768
[bleep] off.

30:51.810 --> 30:55.021
When people challenge me, I
go 20 times my original pace.

30:56.690 --> 30:59.192
Courts will go off last,
unless captain changes it.

30:59.234 --> 31:01.653
Storm, you can start
releasing the lines.

31:01.695 --> 31:03.613
All right release everything
on the stern.

31:03.655 --> 31:05.615
You could drop both lines
on the starboard side.

31:05.657 --> 31:06.700
Copy that.

31:06.741 --> 31:08.201
And then single up on the port
side.

31:08.243 --> 31:10.495
Reid worked on tugboats,
comes from a family

31:10.537 --> 31:11.996
that owns a towing company.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.666
He’s a line-handler,
that’s all they do.

31:14.708 --> 31:17.377
So, I’m fine with
Reid handling lines.

31:17.419 --> 31:19.129
I’m on the starboard side
of the vessel,

31:19.170 --> 31:20.714
so you’ll have to let me
know when it’s clear to swing.

31:20.755 --> 31:22.090
Copy that, Cap.

31:22.132 --> 31:23.675
You know how important
it is to pull fast?

31:23.717 --> 31:26.845
-Yes, sir... ma’am.
-That’s fine. It’s fine.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.346
Shouldn’t have said that.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.225
<i>That’s all lines</i>
<i>on deck on the stern,</i>

31:32.267 --> 31:34.185
<i>all lines on deck on the stern.</i>

31:36.312 --> 31:37.689
Starboard’s loose.

31:37.731 --> 31:38.773
Port bowline is on deck,

31:38.815 --> 31:40.567
you are free, Captain,
you are free.

31:43.445 --> 31:45.196
Storm, I can do the fender.

31:45.238 --> 31:47.615
All right, I’ll let you know.

31:47.657 --> 31:50.076
<i>Three meters to</i>
<i>V4 off your port.</i>

31:56.166 --> 31:59.294
One meter to V4,
port quarter.

32:00.754 --> 32:03.423
Your stern is clear.
Cap, you are clear to swing.

32:15.769 --> 32:17.145
<i>Thank you, Courtney.</i>

32:17.187 --> 32:20.940
First charter as lead deckhand,
boat’s not crashed.

32:20.982 --> 32:22.817
So far, so good on this job.

32:22.859 --> 32:24.402
[laughing]

32:24.444 --> 32:27.113
It really is a beautiful harbor,
the way it’s framed.

32:27.155 --> 32:28.990
Yeah.
This is amazing.

32:29.032 --> 32:32.202
You got two, big boy?

32:32.243 --> 32:33.745
-Dude, nice job.
-Thanks.

32:33.787 --> 32:35.914
You’re gonna go down and
get changed into your red polo.

32:35.955 --> 32:36.915
Got it.

32:36.956 --> 32:37.916
Excuse me, ladies.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.709
Mystery suitcase.

32:41.628 --> 32:43.546
Stuff really
is gonna get freaky.

32:43.588 --> 32:45.590
All right, who’s gonna be the
first person in the baby seat?

32:45.632 --> 32:46.591
We are!

32:46.633 --> 32:47.926
[laughing]

32:47.967 --> 32:49.511
[gasps]

32:53.556 --> 32:55.725
Gonna be a lit couple of days.

32:58.937 --> 33:00.146
Yeah.

33:03.024 --> 33:04.442
Cheers.

33:04.484 --> 33:06.277
I’m gonna get changed.

33:06.319 --> 33:08.113
On that note.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.739
Oh, my God.

33:17.205 --> 33:18.498
That’s luxury.

33:18.540 --> 33:21.084
-I need that smile back.
-Has my smile gone?

33:21.126 --> 33:23.044
-Yeah.
-Has it? Why?

33:23.086 --> 33:24.629
Do you think?

33:24.671 --> 33:25.964
You know, it’s when
people disrespect you.

33:26.006 --> 33:28.925
-I get it.
-Shut up. Stop winding me up.

33:28.967 --> 33:32.679
With Natalya, I do need
to confront things face-on.

33:32.721 --> 33:35.557
But she’s just gonna
scream and shout.

33:35.598 --> 33:37.684
I can see it getting
even more heated.

33:37.726 --> 33:39.644
The guests, they’re on vacation.

33:39.686 --> 33:42.647
They don’t need
negativity draining them.

33:45.066 --> 33:47.152
For now.

33:47.193 --> 33:48.570
All right, ladies,
step on down.

33:48.611 --> 33:49.779
Should we get
naked first, though?

33:49.821 --> 33:51.072
Ah!

33:51.114 --> 33:52.240
Yeah, you can do whatever
you’d like to do.

33:52.282 --> 33:54.993
-Okay.
-All righty.

33:55.035 --> 33:56.578
Oh, my God.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.496
Like, wow, what
the [bleep] is going on?

33:58.538 --> 34:01.916
Jump on here,
then jump in there.

34:01.958 --> 34:03.668
And then pull your straps on.

34:03.710 --> 34:05.170
I’m trying to be
respectful here,

34:05.211 --> 34:07.130
because I don’t really
know what to do.

34:07.172 --> 34:08.173
Okay, you ready?

34:08.214 --> 34:10.842
Ready!

34:10.884 --> 34:12.052
Holy sh--.

34:12.093 --> 34:13.345
Oh, my God.

34:13.386 --> 34:15.680
They’re completely nude
in the chairs.

34:15.722 --> 34:17.849
-What, are they just naked?
-Completely nude.

34:17.891 --> 34:18.975
No, they’re not.

34:19.017 --> 34:21.186
Stripped down right
in front of Storm.

34:21.227 --> 34:23.480
Is their vagina out?

34:23.521 --> 34:24.522
I’m not jealous.

34:24.564 --> 34:25.982
Did I just walk into, like,

34:26.024 --> 34:27.525
the weirdest thing
that I’ve ever seen?

34:27.567 --> 34:29.861
But maybe their panties
could stay on.

34:29.903 --> 34:32.197
Storm, get
from eye-level, mate.

34:32.238 --> 34:34.199
[laughing]

34:51.341 --> 34:52.050
Is the anchor ready to drop?

34:53.551 --> 34:54.886
We are ready to drop, Captain,
we are ready to drop.

34:54.928 --> 34:56.346
Woo!

34:56.388 --> 34:58.223
We’re gonna need to go
four shackles in the water.

34:58.264 --> 35:00.100
You release, I’ll count.

35:00.141 --> 35:01.810
Okay, anchor down, anchor down.

35:01.851 --> 35:03.561
Yeah, this way, lefty loosey,
there we go.

35:09.109 --> 35:10.360
You’re doing a good job.

35:10.402 --> 35:11.945
Reid’s very keen
to get things done.

35:11.986 --> 35:14.948
Where I felt sometimes Jason
was a lot in, like, a limbo,

35:14.989 --> 35:18.076
I’m definitely gonna have
more of a communication line

35:18.118 --> 35:24.332
between me and Reid to avoid
any Jason-like problems.

35:27.502 --> 35:28.878
That’s good, Storm,
you can lock it off,

35:28.920 --> 35:30.839
and then just let me know
what the stay is.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.549
Eleven o’clock long stay, Cap.

35:32.590 --> 35:34.551
Okay, we’re good, you can
put the anchor ball up.

35:34.592 --> 35:35.719
We’re all set.
Thank you.

35:41.683 --> 35:42.684
Yeah.

35:42.726 --> 35:44.811
One of us needs
to go to the beach.

35:44.853 --> 35:47.981
They’re gonna hike up the rock,
then they’re gonna have drinks.

35:48.023 --> 35:50.775
-Do you want to go?
-I’ll go to the beach.

35:50.817 --> 35:52.152
Do you wanna go get all
that stuff ready, then?

35:52.193 --> 35:53.778
Yeah, so what do you want?

35:53.820 --> 35:57.824
The little plates, obviously,
to put the fruit onto, napkins.

36:02.829 --> 36:05.707
Natalya, take everyone to
the beach while we relax

36:05.749 --> 36:08.960
on the yacht
with no guests and no duties.

36:14.174 --> 36:15.800
Do you need a hand there?

36:15.842 --> 36:17.427
-No, she’s good.
-Pardon?

36:17.469 --> 36:19.304
No, I’m all good.
Thanks.

36:19.346 --> 36:20.472
She’s a ----ing weapon.

36:20.513 --> 36:23.308
So, did you manage
to find a beach?

36:23.350 --> 36:25.352
You know what, the nude beach...

36:25.393 --> 36:27.520
it wasn’t a nude beach
until you guys got on there,

36:27.562 --> 36:29.189
so now it’s the nude beach.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.815
-Excellent, excellent.
-Yeah.

36:30.857 --> 36:33.693
Okay, so, after the guests
have something to eat,

36:33.735 --> 36:34.903
we’re gonna take them on a hike.

36:34.944 --> 36:36.738
You three are gonna
go with them.

36:36.780 --> 36:39.699
We’ll just take snacks,
it’s not gonna be a food affair.

36:39.741 --> 36:43.036
All right, let’s start slugging
all that sh-- down, yeah.

36:43.078 --> 36:46.706
Ooh, I didn’t see this.

36:50.168 --> 36:51.503
Mm!

36:53.755 --> 36:54.881
So, how’s it going?

36:54.923 --> 36:56.758
Are you announcing
anything, or...

36:56.800 --> 36:58.885
I’ll come up there
and talk to the wankers.

36:58.927 --> 37:00.428
Mm, interesting.

37:00.470 --> 37:01.971
Not the flavor I thought
it was gonna be.

37:02.013 --> 37:03.431
-Ooh, that looks lovely.
-Doesn’t it?

37:03.473 --> 37:05.058
Yeah.

37:05.100 --> 37:06.142
Done.

37:06.184 --> 37:07.602
Cute.

37:08.812 --> 37:10.021
Let me ask you a question...

37:10.063 --> 37:11.398
have we been total pigs
because we already

37:11.439 --> 37:12.941
ruined the display
by eating one?

37:12.982 --> 37:14.401
Oh!

37:14.442 --> 37:16.486
We just didn’t have the
willpower, it looked so good.

37:16.528 --> 37:17.987
I wanna do that to this one too,

37:18.029 --> 37:20.115
but I don’t wanna ruin
the nice job he’s done.

37:23.618 --> 37:24.577
All right.

37:24.619 --> 37:27.789
Okay with the seating?

37:27.831 --> 37:29.124
This looks great,
Tash, thank you.

37:30.291 --> 37:31.334
-You got it?
-Yeah.

37:31.376 --> 37:32.961
Oh, I’ll have some of that.

37:33.003 --> 37:35.880
-Hey, good-lookin’.
-Ooh, love the robe.

37:37.590 --> 37:38.925
Just all back on the swim?

37:38.967 --> 37:40.969
Yeah, just neatly
on the side, yeah?

37:41.011 --> 37:42.095
Yeah.

37:42.137 --> 37:43.888
-Clear?
-Yeah.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.519
-Hey, guys.
-Chef!

37:49.561 --> 37:50.937
Great stuff.

37:50.979 --> 37:51.980
-Everything tastes great.
-Great, thank you.

37:52.022 --> 37:53.690
So, I’ll talk you through it

37:53.732 --> 37:55.608
So, I’ve got some
braised wild rice, some quinoa,

37:55.650 --> 37:57.610
just seasoned with
beetroot, lots of orange.

37:57.652 --> 37:59.279
Got some nori rolls there with

37:59.320 --> 38:02.282
a carrot and ginger puree,
some grilled filet.

38:02.323 --> 38:03.366
All right, I hope you enjoy it.

38:03.408 --> 38:04.367
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank you.

38:04.409 --> 38:05.368
Thank you, Dave.

38:05.410 --> 38:06.619
This is, like, a perfect lunch.

38:06.661 --> 38:08.163
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

38:08.204 --> 38:10.415
Thanks so much.

38:10.457 --> 38:12.000
Why have I done
this so awkwardly?

38:12.042 --> 38:13.668
So, when I come back from
the beach, it’ll just be,

38:13.710 --> 38:16.838
like, champagne and then,
like, mimosas and stuff?

38:20.091 --> 38:22.594
So, VIP...

38:22.635 --> 38:23.762
-Of the double, gotcha.
-Okay.

38:23.803 --> 38:25.096
The steak is in truffle.

38:25.138 --> 38:26.806
Truffle oil has nothing
to do with truffles.

38:26.848 --> 38:28.224
Mm-hmm.

38:28.266 --> 38:29.476
Well, what’s it made from,
then, if it’s not...

38:29.517 --> 38:30.518
-Chemicals.
-All chemicals?

38:30.560 --> 38:31.811
Chemicals.

38:31.853 --> 38:33.646
The center of a fig
is a dead wasp.

38:33.688 --> 38:35.815
-No.
-That’s decomposed.

38:35.857 --> 38:39.652
Yeah, that’s how the fig
gets pollinated or whatever.

38:39.694 --> 38:41.821
So, every fig starts
with a dead wasp,

38:41.863 --> 38:44.449
or a wasp that did something,

38:44.491 --> 38:47.827
died in it, and then the fig
reacts around the dead wasp.

38:47.869 --> 38:48.912
No.

38:48.953 --> 38:50.830
Yeah, and then
the wasp dissolves...

38:50.872 --> 38:52.207
No.

38:52.248 --> 38:53.833
And so, you’re eating,
like, the decomposed parts

38:53.875 --> 38:55.669
-of a dead wasp...
-No.

38:55.710 --> 38:57.170
...every time you eat a fig.

38:57.212 --> 38:59.631
-That’s cool, I like that.
-No, you can look it up.

39:03.176 --> 39:06.137
All right, JT.

39:06.179 --> 39:08.598
Okay. Ow.

39:08.640 --> 39:09.808
That was my head.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.524
So, what’s the plan,
we’re going for a hike?

39:17.565 --> 39:18.900
Yeah, we’re gonna go for a hike,

39:18.942 --> 39:20.694
and then I’ll take
some pictures up there.

39:20.735 --> 39:22.320
You guys can
do some TikToks.

39:25.782 --> 39:26.991
Through the feed leader.

39:27.033 --> 39:28.702
-Howdy.
-Howdy, ma’am.

39:28.743 --> 39:29.703
I’m coming to the beach.

39:29.744 --> 39:30.995
Are you coming with?

39:31.037 --> 39:32.372
Yeah, are you gonna
come to the beach?

39:32.414 --> 39:34.374
I’m gonna come now,
but then not later.

39:34.416 --> 39:37.043
Because I’ve gotta stay here and
put all the skis and toys in.

39:37.085 --> 39:38.169
Ah.

39:43.383 --> 39:45.635
-I hope everything’s fine.
-Yeah.

39:48.596 --> 39:50.557
Shake them here on the
table if they’ve got food,

39:50.598 --> 39:52.642
-and then just wipe the table.
-Mm-hmm.

39:55.103 --> 39:55.854
Hi.

39:55.895 --> 39:57.272
Fancy seeing you here.

39:57.313 --> 39:59.691
Toss the line.

39:59.733 --> 40:01.359
Welcome to the moon.

40:03.611 --> 40:04.946
You know NASA faked
the moon landing,

40:04.988 --> 40:06.322
so this is actually
where they filmed it.

40:06.364 --> 40:07.907
This is... is that where
the sign is, over there?

40:07.949 --> 40:10.118
Yeah, that’s the American flag,
right there.

40:10.160 --> 40:12.370
-Ready, guys?
-Let’s go.

40:14.956 --> 40:16.374
All right, who’s my mule?

40:16.416 --> 40:17.542
Hello.

40:17.584 --> 40:19.210
We are mules for
you on the beach.

40:19.252 --> 40:21.796
Okay, let’s make this place look
like a Catalina wine mixer.

40:21.838 --> 40:24.007
And into the boat you go.
Well done, good job.

40:24.049 --> 40:27.135
There you go,
Bob’s your uncle.

40:29.637 --> 40:31.556
How you finding work
so far, you loving life?

40:31.598 --> 40:33.767
I... it just...

40:33.808 --> 40:34.976
-Adjusting?
-Yeah.

40:35.018 --> 40:36.394
How’s it been for y’all?

40:36.436 --> 40:38.146
Y’all have definitely
been here longer.

40:38.188 --> 40:40.482
Yeah, having to deal with
that, you know, every day...

40:40.523 --> 40:41.941
That makes sense.

40:41.983 --> 40:45.111
It’s a lot, and plus
Courtney, plus Storm.

40:45.153 --> 40:46.988
Like, being the only
legend on the boat

40:47.030 --> 40:48.615
and the vessel,
it’s, like, really hard.

40:48.656 --> 40:50.450
Me and Captain Sandy have
this really good relationship,

40:50.492 --> 40:52.285
and she doesn’t like
anyone else, so it’s, like...

40:52.327 --> 40:54.996
Yeah, you shoulder the whole
burden of everybody else.

40:55.038 --> 40:57.165
Yeah, so it’s really hard,
carrying everyone, but...

40:57.207 --> 40:58.750
-It’s tough.
-It’s been all right.

40:58.792 --> 41:00.085
So, have fun,
I’ll see you shortly.

41:00.126 --> 41:02.087
Au revoir.

41:02.128 --> 41:03.630
We’re going on a hike!

41:03.672 --> 41:05.131
Woo!

41:05.173 --> 41:06.800
Interior, interior, interior,

41:06.841 --> 41:09.719
that is guests leaving the boat,
guests leaving the boat.

41:09.761 --> 41:11.680
All you have on
this table is fatty foods.

41:11.721 --> 41:13.390
I’ve got nuts.

41:13.431 --> 41:15.642
-Captain Courtney.
-Captain Courtney!

41:15.684 --> 41:16.851
Woo!

41:16.893 --> 41:17.977
Oh, here they are.

41:18.019 --> 41:21.481
Oh, this is fantastic.

41:21.523 --> 41:22.774
Nice location!

41:22.816 --> 41:25.151
Good job, Captain Courtney.

41:25.193 --> 41:26.319
Hey, guys!

41:29.239 --> 41:33.284
Jesus, I wanna go on a yacht
and drink and eat and be merry,

41:33.326 --> 41:36.496
and I’ll pose
in the nude for someone,

41:36.538 --> 41:38.957
if that’s what it takes.

41:38.998 --> 41:40.250
-Boom.
-Thank you.

41:40.291 --> 41:41.835
You getting ready
to do the slide?

41:41.876 --> 41:43.837
I’m gonna do
the trampoline first,

41:43.878 --> 41:46.172
and then I’ll do
the slide straight after.

41:46.214 --> 41:48.008
This is great,
look at this.

41:48.049 --> 41:49.009
Like a moonscape!

41:49.050 --> 41:50.176
-Love it.
-Woo-hoo!

41:50.218 --> 41:51.720
-Hi, everyone, welcome.
-Woo-hoo!

41:51.761 --> 41:52.762
Nice!

41:52.804 --> 41:54.014
...editions.

41:54.055 --> 41:55.181
Reid, I’m gonna run Mzi back.

41:55.223 --> 41:56.349
-Yeah.
-Then I’ll come...

41:56.391 --> 41:57.767
If you wanna take
the photo stuff,

41:57.809 --> 41:59.477
then I’ll come up
with the waters.

41:59.519 --> 42:00.812
Wanna go for a ride?

42:00.854 --> 42:03.398
-This is your new bar.
-Yeah.

42:03.440 --> 42:04.858
Yee-haw!

42:08.987 --> 42:10.321
Okay, bye forever.

42:16.953 --> 42:18.163
And we’re parked.

42:20.457 --> 42:21.916
Whew, perfect.

42:21.958 --> 42:22.959
I just wanna tell you
real quick,

42:23.001 --> 42:24.252
we are gonna go up this incline,

42:24.294 --> 42:25.670
so we’re gonna
take it really slow.

42:25.712 --> 42:27.047
We’re gonna go up to the top,

42:27.088 --> 42:28.506
we’re gonna
follow that ridge around

42:28.548 --> 42:29.883
and then up between that gap.

42:29.924 --> 42:30.884
-You all ready?
-That’s cool.

42:30.925 --> 42:32.177
Let’s do it.

42:32.218 --> 42:33.511
This is gonna be fun
going down, Eric.

42:33.553 --> 42:35.138
This is the quad day.

42:35.180 --> 42:36.639
I’m not great with heights.

42:36.681 --> 42:39.434
Don’t look down, Hannah,
just don’t look down.

42:39.476 --> 42:41.770
There’s no way in hell
that I’m walking up that hill.

42:41.811 --> 42:43.563
I hate any physical activity...

42:43.605 --> 42:45.940
exercise, gross;
walking, gross.

42:48.568 --> 42:49.736
It’s just not my thing.

42:49.778 --> 42:50.779
I see some great
shots on these rocks.

42:50.820 --> 42:51.988
Wow.

42:52.030 --> 42:53.406
You need to
put fuel in firstly.

42:53.448 --> 42:54.908
You wanna do your welcome
drinks and towels.

42:54.949 --> 42:56.910
I’ll get this then
go the other way.

42:56.951 --> 42:58.536
Where is the scary part?

42:58.578 --> 42:59.496
Awesome.

43:01.122 --> 43:03.249
Good job, give
yourself some leeway.

43:03.291 --> 43:06.169
Drop-off tomorrow, thank gosh.

43:06.211 --> 43:09.339
-Oh, JT!
-That’s what happens!

43:09.381 --> 43:10.340
[shouting]

43:10.382 --> 43:12.175
-Woo woo woo!
-Here, here, here.

43:12.217 --> 43:14.219
So then as soon as you’re
done here, you can go down.

43:14.260 --> 43:17.180
You got up there
quickly, Courtney.

43:17.222 --> 43:18.932
So pretty...
what do you think?

43:18.973 --> 43:19.933
I think this is great.

43:19.974 --> 43:20.934
-Photos?
-Yep.

43:20.975 --> 43:21.935
Are we ----ing nude?

43:21.976 --> 43:23.186
Nude, whatever you wanna shoot.

43:23.228 --> 43:24.396
-Okay. I...
-I was gonna do nude.

43:24.437 --> 43:26.314
Yeah.

43:26.356 --> 43:29.359
I’m gonna shoot some
from here, okay?

43:29.401 --> 43:31.486
All right, all right,
I’m shooting now.

43:31.528 --> 43:32.987
Nice.

43:33.029 --> 43:36.116
That looks hot.

43:36.157 --> 43:38.284
That looks great!

43:44.249 --> 43:47.043
Back arched, butt up in
the air, legs crossed.

43:47.085 --> 43:48.378
I feel really awkward.

43:48.420 --> 43:49.838
I know it’s just
a woman that’s naked...

43:49.879 --> 43:51.256
like, fine.

43:51.297 --> 43:53.800
But I come from a
really conservative place,

43:53.842 --> 43:56.011
and I just feel uncomfortable.

43:56.052 --> 43:57.846
My mom would be
in such disbelief.

43:57.887 --> 44:00.348
She would say,
"This ain’t right."

44:00.390 --> 44:02.726
-Cool pics.
-Great stuff.

44:02.767 --> 44:04.436
My God.

44:05.520 --> 44:06.771
Coming up...

44:06.813 --> 44:08.023
You’ve been... Between the two
of you,

44:08.064 --> 44:09.274
someone could
have done that cabin.

44:09.315 --> 44:10.900
Time management...
make it better.

44:10.942 --> 44:12.402
I’m not gonna eat
your bullsh--.

44:22.579 --> 44:23.830
A little bit more that way,
so I can see your butt.

44:26.166 --> 44:27.834
Just a little bit...

44:27.876 --> 44:29.627
There, there, perfect.

44:31.046 --> 44:33.381
Cutlery, might as well
just do that now.

44:35.633 --> 44:37.177
Wipe this table down.

44:39.095 --> 44:40.388
All right, good, we’re done.

44:40.430 --> 44:41.806
Let’s go.

44:41.848 --> 44:43.099
Round up.

45:16.633 --> 45:17.634
Yes, please.

45:24.683 --> 45:26.851
You want me to hold
the towel for you?

45:26.893 --> 45:28.186
Changing room.

45:36.361 --> 45:37.237
Hey?

45:37.278 --> 45:38.905
You gonna let it go?

45:38.947 --> 45:42.742
Yeah, you know what I’m like.
Just forgive and move on.

45:42.784 --> 45:45.870
You live in the present
and not in the past.

45:45.912 --> 45:47.247
Good attitude.

45:47.288 --> 45:49.040
Are you gonna have
that attitude, too?

45:49.082 --> 45:50.625
I’m a big more ----ed
up than you, though, so.

45:50.667 --> 45:52.585
That’s a bit harsh
on yourself, Dave.

45:56.548 --> 45:57.882
Hello, welcome.

45:57.924 --> 45:58.883
Would you like a mimosa?

45:58.925 --> 46:00.135
-Yeah.
-That was fun.

46:00.176 --> 46:02.053
All right.
That was great.

46:02.095 --> 46:03.304
You want straight champers?

46:03.346 --> 46:04.889
As the French say,
just a little, eh?

46:04.931 --> 46:06.516
-Just a little.
-Just a little, eh?

46:07.851 --> 46:10.020
Very cute.
Hold on, let me zoom in.

46:10.937 --> 46:12.230
I like it.

46:12.272 --> 46:14.399
They looked amazing
up there, honestly.

46:14.441 --> 46:15.442
Incredible.

46:15.483 --> 46:16.484
Should have got
some good photos...

46:16.526 --> 46:17.652
-Yeah, yeah.
-...of the crew.

46:17.694 --> 46:18.820
That was incredible.

46:18.862 --> 46:20.697
The rest of...
the other half of the crew

46:20.739 --> 46:22.073
that’s waiting on the boat,
they’re raring to go.

46:23.158 --> 46:24.868
Towels done,
welcome drinks to do...

46:24.909 --> 46:26.119
Yay, nice.

46:26.161 --> 46:27.495
Clean up here,
I have to clean the VIP,

46:27.537 --> 46:29.164
because that wasn’t done at all.

46:29.205 --> 46:32.167
-Storm, Storm, Court.
-Go ahead, Courts.

46:32.208 --> 46:34.836
So, they’re starting to
wrap everything up now.

46:34.878 --> 46:37.297
<i>So we’ll start</i>
<i>packing away, and head back.</i>

46:37.339 --> 46:38.840
<i>I’ll let you know when</i>
<i>we’re leaving the dock.</i>

46:38.882 --> 46:41.551
<i>Yeah, thanks so much,</i>
<i>and I’m ready for you.</i>

46:45.472 --> 46:47.515
I’m definitely
reaping the rewards

46:47.557 --> 46:49.476
of Courtney’s workmanship.

46:49.517 --> 46:51.561
We’re getting fuel
when we get back.

46:51.603 --> 46:53.855
-How much?
-Twenty thousand liters.

46:53.897 --> 46:55.774
Fantastic.

46:55.815 --> 46:57.192
Do you wanna do
welcome drinks and towels?

46:57.233 --> 46:59.069
All righty.

46:59.944 --> 47:01.529
Everyone good?

47:01.571 --> 47:03.490
Bye, everyone!

47:11.081 --> 47:12.540
Mm!

47:12.582 --> 47:14.542
All right, let’s get this
stuff packed away, huh?

47:14.584 --> 47:15.752
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Courtney.

47:15.794 --> 47:17.879
-Well done.
-Hi.

47:17.921 --> 47:20.382
Would you guys like a
cold towel and a mango daiquiri?

47:20.423 --> 47:23.593
Ooh, oh, I live for these.

47:25.303 --> 47:27.305
First day done, one day left.

47:29.265 --> 47:30.725
Well done.
Thanks, guys.

47:30.767 --> 47:31.893
-Can I pass you these on board?
-Yeah, you can.

47:31.935 --> 47:33.228
Did you have lunch?

47:33.269 --> 47:34.813
-I made you a pasta.
-Was it a hot pasta?

47:34.854 --> 47:36.314
Cold pasta salad’s the
worst thing ever invented.

47:36.356 --> 47:38.024
Just heat it up, obviously.

47:38.066 --> 47:39.359
That’s like saying do you want
some cold Vegemite toast.

47:39.401 --> 47:40.652
It’s just not a thing.

47:40.694 --> 47:43.363
Three charters left.
It’ll be fun.

47:43.405 --> 47:46.449
-Oh!
-Thanks, pal.

47:46.491 --> 47:48.034
Ooh.

47:48.076 --> 47:49.077
Just pack it on
the deck behind you.

47:49.119 --> 47:50.328
Yep.

47:53.665 --> 47:55.667
Right.

47:55.709 --> 47:57.627
So, if it was gonna be at...
we’re gonna do the...

47:57.669 --> 47:59.504
we’re gonna
have Mediterranean...

48:05.010 --> 48:06.803
-Hey, thank you.
-Thank you.

48:06.845 --> 48:08.763
-I had fun with you today.
-We had fun.

48:15.979 --> 48:17.605
-Heya.
-Hi.

48:17.647 --> 48:19.107
-You all right, my love?
-Yeah.

48:19.149 --> 48:20.567
Did you have a nice one?

48:20.608 --> 48:22.027
Sorry, I’m just
gonna put--

48:22.068 --> 48:23.278
It was so hot...
no shade.

48:23.319 --> 48:24.446
-Oh!
-At all.

48:24.487 --> 48:26.114
Yeah, I can imagine.

48:26.156 --> 48:27.323
Can I get some chow-chow?

48:27.365 --> 48:29.034
-Yeah.
-Downstairs?

48:29.075 --> 48:30.493
Yeah, go on your break.

48:36.708 --> 48:37.667
Woo!

48:39.753 --> 48:40.879
How was it?

48:40.920 --> 48:43.298
They loved it,
they had an amazing time.

48:43.340 --> 48:45.133
They got some cool photos.

48:45.175 --> 48:46.843
Yeah!

48:55.560 --> 48:56.936
You’re back already?

48:56.978 --> 48:58.355
Yeah, it’s 5:30.

48:58.396 --> 49:00.315
Oh, my God, I didn’t
realize the time passed.

49:00.357 --> 49:02.442
-It went so fast.
-It did go fast.

49:14.662 --> 49:18.249
To find out that Kyle and
Tash have not been in the VIP,

49:18.291 --> 49:19.918
I’m pissed off,

49:19.959 --> 49:23.421
because I cannot take breaks
knowing that cabin wasn’t done.

49:23.463 --> 49:25.090
I know exactly what they
were probably

49:25.131 --> 49:26.633
would have doing
when I was gone.

49:26.675 --> 49:28.176
They’ve been talking sh--
and eating food.

49:28.218 --> 49:30.929
The dream team
has gone downhill.

49:30.970 --> 49:32.806
I can’t believe
the VIP’s not been done.

49:40.939 --> 49:41.356
That was good.

49:42.691 --> 49:43.733
That was good,
I did not throw up.

49:43.775 --> 49:44.943
-Yeah.
-That was also good.

49:44.984 --> 49:45.902
Woo!

49:48.780 --> 49:49.906
Oh, my God.

49:51.783 --> 49:55.120
Will we be able to ride flight
boards, like, tomorrow morning?

49:55.161 --> 49:57.330
Yeah, we’ll have all the
same stuff out tomorrow.

49:57.372 --> 50:00.417
It is weather-dependent.

50:01.626 --> 50:03.628
So, what’s your plan
for tonight?

50:03.670 --> 50:08.216
Big salt-baked fish,
and then starch, veg.

50:08.258 --> 50:09.634
Go ahead.

50:15.807 --> 50:17.225
You’re not gonna ----ing
fit in there,

50:17.267 --> 50:18.893
are you, you little bastard?

50:18.935 --> 50:20.895
It’s super-difficult, because
I’ve got so much fish.

50:20.937 --> 50:23.732
So, I have to bend the
fish to get it in the oven

50:23.773 --> 50:25.775
It’s like [bleep], how am
I gonna make this look good?

50:25.817 --> 50:29.279
I’m sh--ting myself because
it’s too big to get it in there.

50:29.320 --> 50:31.614
It’s gonna almost fuse together.

50:36.578 --> 50:37.996
What’s their evening plan?

50:38.038 --> 50:42.125
We can do, like, black leather,
and maybe some reds.

50:42.167 --> 50:44.919
We’re gonna host
a BDSM party...

50:44.961 --> 50:46.504
----ing outstanding.

50:46.546 --> 50:49.257
I mean, look, at the end of the
day, we’re all wild animals.

50:49.299 --> 50:50.842
We need to learn to be tame,

50:50.884 --> 50:53.303
and Kyle the zookeeper’s
to the rescue, honey.

50:53.345 --> 50:56.306
Yes, bitch!

51:01.686 --> 51:02.520
What?

51:02.562 --> 51:03.855
That’s ass juice on there.

51:06.316 --> 51:07.776
Holy sh--.

51:07.817 --> 51:09.944
You look like that sexy,
one off "Cruel Intentions."

51:09.986 --> 51:11.821
Oh, my God.

51:13.114 --> 51:14.616
Lovely stuff.

51:14.657 --> 51:16.284
I don’t know if you
wanna hang the red curtains

51:16.326 --> 51:17.619
on each side there.

51:17.660 --> 51:19.120
I was thinking
that’d be a whole, like,

51:19.162 --> 51:22.123
red light district vibe.

51:22.165 --> 51:23.625
It’s gotta be dirty.

51:25.710 --> 51:27.170
-Is he actually, though?
-Yeah.

51:27.212 --> 51:29.506
Oh, he’s here.

51:31.466 --> 51:33.301
He’s the naked stripper
of the boat.

51:33.343 --> 51:34.886
Come on.

51:38.682 --> 51:40.141
Out of all the crew.

51:40.183 --> 51:41.559
Get us that tip money.

51:41.601 --> 51:43.353
Get us tip money.

51:43.395 --> 51:48.525
Tash, she looks ----ing
so hot, Jesus.

51:52.195 --> 51:53.530
Ooh!

51:53.571 --> 51:54.823
-Rawr.
-Well done, sisters.

51:54.864 --> 51:57.033
This looks really
good, guys.

51:58.660 --> 52:00.870
Okay, I’m gonna
go to laundry, guys.

52:03.873 --> 52:05.333
I figured out why
my pants don’t fit...

52:05.375 --> 52:08.461
they’re 32x30s, not 32x32.

52:08.503 --> 52:11.089
So, I had to tighten my
belt a little bit.

52:13.258 --> 52:14.592
Absolutely not.

52:14.634 --> 52:18.138
I lost, like, 20 pounds
in the last year.

52:19.889 --> 52:22.392
You’re talking to people who
use the metric system, mate.

52:22.434 --> 52:25.854
I don’t know, what is 20 pounds,
like six meters?

52:25.895 --> 52:27.355
-No, like...
-No, what’s that?

52:27.397 --> 52:28.940
-That’s the wrong measurement.
-No!

52:31.317 --> 52:34.029
You’ve gotta, like, put
your hands up onto each side.

52:34.070 --> 52:35.363
[laughing]

52:35.405 --> 52:36.489
Will you take one of us?

52:36.531 --> 52:38.158
-Yeah, I got it.
-Get in, get in.

52:38.199 --> 52:40.368
All right, I love that.

52:40.410 --> 52:43.204
Dude, this is the craziest
thing I’ve ever been a part of.

52:43.246 --> 52:44.706
Well, welcome.

52:44.748 --> 52:47.292
No, no, the best, but crazy.

52:47.334 --> 52:48.460
Are they uncomfortable?

52:48.501 --> 52:49.586
Not at all.

52:49.627 --> 52:51.171
Look at that.

52:51.212 --> 52:52.881
Oh!

52:54.507 --> 52:55.842
No, I’m good.

53:07.437 --> 53:08.938
I think so.

53:10.565 --> 53:11.566
Yeah.

53:11.608 --> 53:13.109
So, apologies for the delay.

53:19.616 --> 53:22.202
Ooh, you all right?

53:22.243 --> 53:24.871
-Oh, yeah, totally, thank you.
-Okay, love.

53:30.627 --> 53:32.253
You’ve really pissed me off.

53:32.295 --> 53:34.130
Okay, first of all, do not say,

53:34.172 --> 53:37.258
"Sorry the head of housekeeping
wasn’t here to do your cabin."

53:37.300 --> 53:38.927
There’s two of you on the boat.

53:38.968 --> 53:40.512
You’ve been a chief stew,
you’ve been a chief stew.

53:40.553 --> 53:41.763
Both of you are equal.

53:41.805 --> 53:43.306
One...

53:43.348 --> 53:44.474
between the two of you, someone
could have done that cabin.

53:44.516 --> 53:45.475
-No.
-Time management.

53:45.517 --> 53:46.893
-No.
-Make it better.

53:46.935 --> 53:48.186
Do not say, "The head of
housekeeping wasn’t able

53:48.228 --> 53:49.854
to get to your cabin today."

53:49.896 --> 53:51.606
You are also responsible for
the housekeeping on this boat.

53:51.648 --> 53:52.774
There’s no head of housekeeping,

53:52.816 --> 53:54.776
but do not go and try to
blame me.

53:54.818 --> 53:56.277
No one blamed you.

53:56.319 --> 53:57.904
No, because you’ve just said

53:57.946 --> 53:59.406
the head of housekeeping
was not here, Kyle.

53:59.447 --> 54:00.782
You didn’t hear the full story.

54:00.824 --> 54:02.450
If you think you’re gonna
come for me

54:02.492 --> 54:04.994
like you come for everyone else,
you’re highly ----ing mistaken.

54:05.036 --> 54:06.955
I’ll put you right in
your place, trust me.

54:06.996 --> 54:08.498
I’m not gonna eat your
bullsh--

54:08.540 --> 54:10.125
like you can pick
on everybody else.

54:10.166 --> 54:12.544
You’re 24 ----ing years old,
act mature.

54:14.129 --> 54:16.965
I’ll switch that bitch off
in two ----ing seconds.

54:19.134 --> 54:21.886
Not on my watch.

54:21.928 --> 54:23.555
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

54:23.596 --> 54:24.848
Come in just straight to me.

54:24.889 --> 54:26.057
Kill it, kill it, kill it...

54:26.099 --> 54:27.100
reverse, reverse...

54:27.142 --> 54:29.477
-[crunch]
-Oh!

54:29.519 --> 54:33.064
Oh [bleep] me.
[bleep] me.

54:33.106 --> 54:35.316
Do you fancy anybody
on board, other than me?

54:35.358 --> 54:36.693
No, I’m joking.

54:36.735 --> 54:39.404
You have an undiagnosed
case of narcissism.

54:39.446 --> 54:42.532
Wow, ----ing hell.

54:42.574 --> 54:44.951
Body image, it’s really hard
for me to,

54:44.993 --> 54:46.703
like, suppress that part down,

54:46.745 --> 54:48.663
and he’s literally just,
like ----ing let it roar

54:48.705 --> 54:50.415
in my ----ing brain.

54:50.457 --> 54:52.584
I’ve never said
anything like that.

54:55.420 --> 54:57.088
I am fed up with
the interior crew.

54:57.130 --> 54:58.715
I’m just over it.

54:58.757 --> 55:00.592
I’ve got nothing else more to
explain to you than what I did.

55:00.633 --> 55:01.676
Don’t try this bullsh--.

55:01.718 --> 55:02.677
Kyle, pipe down.

55:02.719 --> 55:04.429
You’ve been taking trash.

55:04.471 --> 55:06.097
I’m literally the most
calmest person sitting here.

55:06.139 --> 55:07.223
I’m ----ing calm.

55:07.265 --> 55:08.433
-I’m...
-You know, let’s just stop.

55:08.475 --> 55:09.559
Shut your ----ing sh--.

55:09.601 --> 55:10.852
Kyle, come to the toilet.
