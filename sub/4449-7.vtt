23:22.741 --> 23:25.243
I'M JUST WORKING
ON SOME OF THE ADVANCED BADGES.

23:31.549 --> 23:33.585
- GOOD OF YOU TO JUMP IN,
FIRST DAY AND ALL.

23:33.618 --> 23:35.220
- JUST TRYING
TO MAKE MYSELF USEFUL.

23:35.220 --> 23:38.690
- GOT TO MAKE SURE WE
DON'T BECOME OBSOLETE, DON'T WE?

23:38.723 --> 23:41.192
SO, SINCE YOU'RE LEARNING
THE LAY OF THE LAND STILL,

23:41.226 --> 23:42.627
I'M JUST GONNA PUT YOU
ON SUPPORT.

23:42.627 --> 23:44.763
- YOU SURE? I'M HAPPY TO BE DOWN
ON THE FRONT LINES.

23:44.763 --> 23:46.031
- AH, EASY.

23:46.064 --> 23:47.632
MY TEAM'S, UH,
ON THE FRONT LINES.

23:47.666 --> 23:49.567
IT'S JUST THE WAY WE WORK.
- ALL RIGHT.

23:49.601 --> 23:51.169
- BUT WHAT'S THAT SAYING?

23:51.202 --> 23:53.238
NO SMALL PARTS,
JUST SMALL PLAYERS.

23:53.238 --> 23:55.740
- [laughs]

24:01.079 --> 24:03.214
- [laughing]

24:03.214 --> 24:07.218
- [snorting]

24:07.218 --> 24:08.353
WHOO!

24:12.557 --> 24:14.492
- AHH!

24:14.492 --> 24:16.027
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

24:16.061 --> 24:18.163
- DIEGO SAID THAT
CARLITO WAS SELLING HIM

24:18.196 --> 24:20.231
SOME SORT
OF MILITARY-GRADE WEAPONS.

24:20.265 --> 24:23.134
- OKAY, THEN W-WHEN ARE
THE GUNS SUPPOSED TO GET HERE?

24:23.168 --> 24:25.070
- JOHNNY, THERE ARE NO GUNS.

24:25.103 --> 24:26.404
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
"THERE ARE NO GUNS"?

24:26.404 --> 24:28.139
- I OVERHEARD CARLITO SAYING
THAT THEY GOT BLOWN UP

24:28.173 --> 24:29.708
IN A SHIPMENT OR SOMETHING.
I DON'T--

24:29.741 --> 24:33.278
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY.

24:33.311 --> 24:35.380
- THEN WHAT THE HELL
ARE WE STALLING FOR?

24:35.380 --> 24:36.982
- THE MAN THAT MY FATHER
USUALLY SENDS

24:37.015 --> 24:38.650
FOR THESE THINGS
WASN'T AVAILABLE,

24:38.683 --> 24:41.019
SO HE SENT SIMON FROM MEJICO.

24:43.722 --> 24:45.590
- TIME'S UP.

24:47.726 --> 24:49.694
[snorting]

24:49.728 --> 24:52.230
[doorbell rings]

24:54.099 --> 24:55.400
- STAY PUT.

24:55.433 --> 24:56.634
- IS THAT HIM?

24:56.668 --> 24:58.570
- HE'S HERE.

24:58.570 --> 25:00.105
- YOU GOT THE GUNS?

25:00.138 --> 25:01.373
- WHERE'S LUCIA?

25:07.012 --> 25:08.246
- [snaps]

25:10.682 --> 25:13.418
- YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I'M JUST GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

25:15.420 --> 25:16.388
- [sniffs]

25:16.421 --> 25:18.356
- CUT THEM OUT OF THESE, NOW.

25:18.390 --> 25:21.359
- YOU'RE LATE, AND THEN
YOU START BARKING ORDERS AT US?

25:21.393 --> 25:23.995
- MR. SOLANO WILL NOT BE HAPPY

25:24.029 --> 25:26.297
TO HEAR ABOUT HOW YOU
TREATED HIS DAUGHTER.

25:32.303 --> 25:33.538
- NOW...

25:33.571 --> 25:36.174
OUR GUNS.

25:36.207 --> 25:38.576
- THE M4 ASSAULT RIFLE--

25:38.610 --> 25:42.480
GAS-OPERATED, MAGAZINE-FED.

25:42.514 --> 25:45.083
A THING OF BEAUTY.

26:25.223 --> 26:28.693
- I'M SORRY THAT I'VE DRAGGED
YOU INTO ALL THIS...

26:28.726 --> 26:30.495
ALL THIS MESS.

26:30.495 --> 26:35.133
- HEY, LET'S GET YOU OUT
OF HERE BEFORE THE POLICE COME.

26:35.166 --> 26:37.702
- WHERE CAN WE GO?

26:37.735 --> 26:39.337
- I'M NOT SURE YET.

26:39.370 --> 26:41.339
UM, HOW ABOUT A HOTEL?

26:41.372 --> 26:42.607
- THEY CAME TO MY HOUSE.

26:42.607 --> 26:44.342
THEY'RE GONNA FIND ME
IN SOME STUPID MOTEL.

26:44.375 --> 26:47.278
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
WHAT ABOUT A FRIEND'S HOUSE?

26:47.312 --> 26:48.980
- I CAN'T PUT ANYONE ELSE
IN DANGER.

26:49.013 --> 26:50.582
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY JUST GO.

26:50.615 --> 26:53.151
- LOOK, I'M NOT JUST GONNA
LEAVE YOU.

26:53.184 --> 26:55.019
UM...
- [sniffles]

26:55.053 --> 26:56.488
- MIRA...

26:56.521 --> 26:58.756
COME ON, I GOT SOMEWHERE
WE CAN GO, OKAY?

26:58.990 --> 27:00.592
COME ON.

27:08.266 --> 27:12.070
- MS. WILSON?
- YES, HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

27:12.103 --> 27:15.006
- MIKE WARREN, FBI.
THIS IS SPECIAL AGENT DEMARCO.

27:15.039 --> 27:16.574
WOULD YOU BE ABLE
TO POINT US IN THE DIRECTION

27:16.608 --> 27:17.976
OF THE SECRET SERVICE?

27:17.976 --> 27:20.211
- YES, OF COURSE, AGENT WARREN.
PLEASE, FOLLOW ME.

27:22.180 --> 27:24.382
- SO WE'RE GONNA PUT A WIRE
ON RANDY,

27:24.415 --> 27:26.217
AND WHEN THE BUY IS A GO,
WE'RE GONNA HOP--

27:26.251 --> 27:27.452
- WHOA, WHOA, WIRE?

27:27.485 --> 27:29.687
YOU AIN'T SAY NOTHING
ABOUT NO WIRE.

27:29.721 --> 27:31.723
- WELL, RANDY,
WE GOT TO GET THE BUY ON TAPE.

27:31.756 --> 27:32.757
WE NEED EARS IN THERE, TOO,

27:32.991 --> 27:34.058
IN CASE ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO YOU, MAN.

27:34.092 --> 27:35.126
- MAN, I WAS IN THERE WITH KYLE

27:35.126 --> 27:36.427
WHEN HE DID A DEAL
WITH THE TRIAD.

27:36.461 --> 27:37.662
DUDE THOUGHT
HE WAS WEARING A WIRE

27:37.662 --> 27:39.397
AND BLEW HIS HEAD OFF.
- RANDY, RANDY.

27:39.397 --> 27:40.999
LISTEN, MAN,
YOU GOT TO RELAX, OKAY?

27:40.999 --> 27:42.133
WE'RE GONNA BE RIGHT THERE.

27:42.133 --> 27:45.570
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE,
ALL RIGHT?

27:45.570 --> 27:48.373
- LET ME SEE THE WIRE.

27:51.142 --> 27:53.111
OH, HELL, NO.
HELL, NO.

27:53.144 --> 27:54.546
IF IT WAS A PIN
OR SOME WATCH OR SOME SH--,

27:54.579 --> 27:57.182
BUT I'M NOT WEARING
NO CRAPPED OUT WIRE FROM 1976.

27:57.215 --> 28:00.351
- RANDY, RANDY, RANDY,
COME ON, WE HAD A DEAL, PAL.

28:00.385 --> 28:01.586
- MY DEAL WAS TO GET YOU
TO MEET.

28:01.619 --> 28:03.121
- NO. NO.
- NOW, IF I GO IN AND GET

28:03.154 --> 28:05.223
MY HEAD BLOWN OFF, WHO'S
GONNA TAKE CARE OF MY BROTHER?

28:05.256 --> 28:07.625
- I'LL WEAR THE WIRE.

28:07.659 --> 28:10.528
HEY, I WORKED THE SANTANAS
DOWN IN EL PASO, YOU KNOW.

28:10.562 --> 28:12.363
READ RANDY'S CASE FILE.
LET ME MAKE THE BUY.

28:12.397 --> 28:13.698
- SLOW DOWN.
SLOW DOWN, WEST.

28:13.698 --> 28:15.300
- THEY ONLY DO BUSINESS
IN TAGALOG.

28:15.333 --> 28:16.434
RANDY WON'T DO IT.

28:16.467 --> 28:18.636
I KNOW ENOUGH
THAT I CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

28:18.670 --> 28:20.405
- SO YOU SPEAK, UM, TAGALOG.

28:20.438 --> 28:23.174
- [speaking Tagalog]

28:23.208 --> 28:24.342
HUH?

28:24.375 --> 28:26.044
COME ON, COACH,
YOU SAID YOU NEED THESE DRUGS

28:26.077 --> 28:27.245
BEFORE THEY HIT
THE STREETS, RIGHT?

28:27.278 --> 28:28.513
RANDALL,
WHAT'S THE PASSWORD?

28:28.546 --> 28:30.515
- IT'S
"ADVANTAGE RED SHELL TOE."

28:30.548 --> 28:33.418
TELL KYLE
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

28:36.688 --> 28:39.123
- DO IT. GO AHEAD, SUIT UP.
- OKAY.

28:39.157 --> 28:41.426
ALL RIGHT.

28:53.718 --> 28:56.387
- UM...

28:58.423 --> 29:01.392
JUST, UH...

29:01.426 --> 29:03.795
JUST GIVE ME A SEC, OKAY?

29:03.828 --> 29:06.431
- WHAT IF SHE SAYS NO?

29:08.599 --> 29:11.336
- I'LL MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T.

29:14.205 --> 29:16.307
[car door opens, beeping]

29:16.307 --> 29:19.744
[dog barking]

29:25.616 --> 29:28.619
[doorbell rings]

29:33.725 --> 29:35.259
HI, MA.

29:35.293 --> 29:36.461
- THREE MONTHS.

29:36.494 --> 29:37.829
THREE MONTHS
I DON'T HEAR FROM YOU.

29:38.062 --> 29:39.764
AND NOW YOU JUST DROP BY.
- HI, MA.

29:39.797 --> 29:41.332
- "HI, MA"? THAT'S ALL
YOU HAVE TO SAY TO ME?

29:41.366 --> 29:42.433
- NO, I JUST--

29:42.467 --> 29:44.102
- I CALLED YOU.
- I KNOW YOU DID. I KNOW.

29:44.135 --> 29:46.537
BROKE MY PHONE, RIGHT,
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING AND--

29:46.571 --> 29:48.072
- NO, NO.

29:48.106 --> 29:49.240
NO, NO.
- MA.

29:49.273 --> 29:50.608
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE?
- NOTHING, MA.

29:50.641 --> 29:52.343
- DID YOU HURT YOURSELF?
- I'M OKAY.

29:52.343 --> 29:55.113
- ARE YOU-- YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.
- NO.

29:55.146 --> 29:58.216
NO, I PROMISE, OKAY?

29:58.249 --> 30:01.619
BUT MY FRIEND...

30:01.619 --> 30:03.721
SHE NEEDS A PLACE TO STAY
FOR THE NIGHT.

30:03.755 --> 30:05.623
- YOU BRINGING TROUBLE
INTO MY HOME?

30:05.656 --> 30:07.592
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS GO THERE?

30:07.592 --> 30:11.095
SHE'S JUST SOMEBODY WHO NEEDS
A LITTLE DECENCY TODAY.

30:14.365 --> 30:17.702
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
YEAH?

30:19.303 --> 30:22.407
- GET IN HERE.
- I LOVE YOU.

30:22.440 --> 30:25.476
THANK YOU.

30:27.612 --> 30:30.214
- MS. WILSON,
WE ALSO NEED A LIST

30:30.248 --> 30:32.583
OF ALL THE DEPOSITS MADE
IN THE LAST 24 HOURS.

30:32.617 --> 30:35.253
THEN HOPEFULLY, WE CAN SEE WHERE
THIS COUNTERFEIT BILL CAME FROM.

30:35.286 --> 30:36.487
- OF COURSE.

30:36.521 --> 30:38.723
[keys clacking]

30:40.224 --> 30:41.692
HERE YOU ARE.

30:41.726 --> 30:43.594

THE COUNTERFEIT BILL, PLEASE?

30:43.628 --> 30:46.497
- YES, I THINK MS. LANKTON
HAS IT OVER THERE.

30:46.531 --> 30:48.499

[copier humming]

31:34.846 --> 31:37.415
[reggaeton music playing]

31:37.448 --> 31:39.550
- YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
IN PARTICULAR?

31:39.584 --> 31:41.719
WE GOT A SALE ON CHUCKS
RIGHT NOW.

31:41.752 --> 31:45.323

WHAT'S THIS SH--?

31:49.494 --> 31:50.795
WHERE'S RANDY?

31:50.828 --> 31:53.164
- RANDY REPORTS TO ME NOW.
I'M PAUL.

31:53.197 --> 31:54.565
THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE
IN MANAGEMENT.

31:54.599 --> 31:56.567
- I DON'T CARE
WHO YOU ARE, PAUL.

31:56.567 --> 31:58.302
I DEAL WITH RANDY.

31:58.302 --> 31:59.737
NO RANDY, NO SALE.

31:59.770 --> 32:02.673
- OKAY, MAYBE THIS MIGHT
CHANGE YOUR MIND NOW.

32:08.079 --> 32:11.282
- SORRY YOU CAME ALL THIS WAY
WITH ALL THIS CASH,

32:11.315 --> 32:14.085
BUT NO DEAL WITHOUT MY BOY.

32:14.118 --> 32:17.522
VINCE, SEE PAUL OUT.

32:17.555 --> 32:20.791

32:23.761 --> 32:26.063
THAT'S A NEAT TRICK,

32:26.097 --> 32:28.332
BUT I ONLY DEAL
WITH PEOPLE I KNOW.

32:28.366 --> 32:29.734
SORRY.

32:34.138 --> 32:37.174
MOTHER--
ARE YOU WEARING A WIRE?

32:37.208 --> 32:38.409
- YEAH, I'M WEARING A WIRE.

32:38.442 --> 32:39.577
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT'S HE DOING?

32:39.610 --> 32:42.380
DID HE JUST TELL THEM
HE WAS WEARING A WIRE?

32:52.323 --> 32:54.425
GO!
COME ON, GO, GO!

33:43.374 --> 33:45.509
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

33:45.509 --> 33:47.745

34:01.092 --> 34:02.660
- CASH?

34:02.693 --> 34:04.228
- PROBABLY.

34:04.261 --> 34:07.198
- IT'S ONE HELL OF A PARACHUTE.

34:07.231 --> 34:09.233
- YOU BELIEVE ME NOW?

34:20.144 --> 34:22.813
- HEY, WEST.
- YEAH.

34:22.847 --> 34:24.649

34:24.682 --> 34:27.084
- SLICK WORK OUT THERE TODAY.
- OH, THANKS.

34:27.118 --> 34:29.153
YOU KNOW, SH-- WENT SOUTH,
SO I HAD TO IMPROVISE.

34:29.186 --> 34:30.588
I HOPE I DIDN'T
STEP ON YOUR TOES.

34:30.621 --> 34:34.258
- YOU KIDDING ME? JOB GOT DONE.
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

34:34.291 --> 34:36.427
I COULD USE A GUY LIKE YOU.

34:36.460 --> 34:39.730
- IS THAT AN OFFER?
- YEAH.

34:39.764 --> 34:42.433
LET'S GO GRAB A BEER, YEAH?
- YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT BACK UP.

34:42.433 --> 34:45.636
I JUST GOT TO WASH OFF
THE STINK OF THE DAY.

34:47.605 --> 34:51.342
- OH, MY GOD.
[laughter]

34:51.375 --> 34:52.843
- I NEVER THOUGHT OF MAKING IT
WITH TOMATILLOS,

34:53.077 --> 34:54.345
BUT I LIKE THE TARTNESS.

34:54.378 --> 34:55.713
- MY FATHER TAUGHT ME.

34:55.746 --> 34:58.849
ALWAYS SAYS,
BEST WAY TO HAVE WHAT YOU WANT,

34:59.083 --> 34:59.850
MAKE IT YOURSELF.

35:00.084 --> 35:01.519
- YEAH.
- MM.

35:01.552 --> 35:02.853
- YOU KNOW, MY SON COOKS.

35:02.853 --> 35:04.121
- MM-MM-MM-MM.
- OH?

35:04.155 --> 35:06.057
- LOOK AT ME.
DON'T TELL THAT STORY.

35:06.090 --> 35:07.158
- [laughs]
- DON'T TELL HER, MA.

35:07.191 --> 35:08.559
- SO I COME HOME FROM WORK...
- [laughs]

35:08.559 --> 35:10.094
- AND I BRING HOME
A BOX OF PAAS,

35:10.127 --> 35:12.229
AND I TOLD HIM TO MAKE THE EGGS
SO WE CAN DYE THEM.

35:12.263 --> 35:14.565
- I WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD.
- I KNOW.

35:14.598 --> 35:15.733
SO I'M IN THE BATHROOM,

35:15.766 --> 35:17.568
AND I HEAR WHAT SOUNDS
LIKE GUNSHOTS.

35:17.601 --> 35:19.637
WE LIVED
IN A BAD NEIGHBORHOOD THEN.

35:19.670 --> 35:22.173
SO I RUN INTO THE KITCHEN
TO MAKE SURE THAT MY BOYS

35:22.206 --> 35:24.308
AREN'T HIT BY ANY STRAY FIRE.
- OF COURSE.

35:24.341 --> 35:27.778
- AND THEN I SEE
THAT IT'S NOT GUNFIRE,

35:27.812 --> 35:29.380
BUT...
[laughs]

35:29.413 --> 35:31.615
BUT EGGS-- EGGS EXPLODING
IN THE MICROWAVE.

35:31.649 --> 35:32.850
- [laughs]
- HUH?

35:33.084 --> 35:34.418
IT WAS LIKE PA,
PA, PA, PA, PA, PA, POW!

35:34.452 --> 35:36.187
PA, PA, PA, PA, POW! POW!
- IT'S SO FUNNY.

35:36.187 --> 35:39.156
IT AIN'T THAT FUNNY.
- [laughs] IT'S REALLY FUNNY.

35:39.190 --> 35:41.492
- FIRST TIME MY SON MADE EGGS.
YOU DID GOOD.

35:41.525 --> 35:43.060
- SO, YO, I'M GOOD
AT PANCAKES, RIGHT?

35:43.094 --> 35:45.629
TELL HER, MA.
- YEAH, H-HE'S GOOD AT PANCAKES.

35:45.663 --> 35:47.765

TO INGRATIATE YOURSELF

37:28.265 --> 37:29.500

NAH, WITH YOU...

37:33.771 --> 37:36.507

A MISTAKE.

37:45.516 --> 37:47.685

UNTIL HE DOES.

37:47.718 --> 37:49.386

RUNNING CLEAN OPS,

37:49.420 --> 37:51.422
AND I CAN'T CONNECT HIM
TO THE GIRLS.

37:51.422 --> 37:52.723

WITH SOLANO BEFORE.

37:52.756 --> 37:55.159
HE SEEMS TO HAVE PRESSED PAUSE
OR RETIRED ALTOGETHER.

37:55.192 --> 37:56.560
I DON'T KNOW.
- YOU DON'T JUST RETIRE.

37:56.560 --> 37:57.728

YOU'RE ON A WINNING STREAK

37:57.761 --> 37:59.730

IN SAFETY DEPOSIT BOXES.

37:59.763 --> 38:01.298

WHAT WE'LL NAIL HIM ON.

- WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN FORCE
HIM BACK THROUGH SHEER WILL.

38:14.545 --> 38:16.814

THAT'S A GAMBLE.

39:39.096 --> 39:41.131
