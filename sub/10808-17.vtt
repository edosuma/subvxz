00:03.070 --> 00:06.062
(theme music playing)

00:19.687 --> 00:24.558
NARRATOR:
Man lives in the sunlit world

00:24.558 --> 00:29.018
of what he believes
to be reality.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.968
But... there is,

00:33.968 --> 00:38.505
unseen by most, an underworld.

00:38.505 --> 00:42.176
A place that is just as real

00:42.176 --> 00:46.280
but not as brightly lit.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.044
A dark side.

01:16.110 --> 01:17.805
J‘J‘

01:23.917 --> 01:27.688
WOMAN:
| photograph everything.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.246
That is my mission.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.220
But I should not have joined
the group.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.365
MAN:
Every time I touched you...

01:38.365 --> 01:40.367
nothing!

01:40.367 --> 01:41.935
It was sick!

01:41.935 --> 01:44.495
Poison! Hateful!

01:46.006 --> 01:49.032
I want to tear your heart out.

01:51.145 --> 01:54.171
(sighs)

01:58.719 --> 02:02.556
What's happened, Lee?

02:02.556 --> 02:04.792
I'm taking a break.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.795
Are you finished with your wife?

02:07.795 --> 02:10.597
How does it look to you, Amy?

02:10.597 --> 02:13.000
Looks finished to me.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.402
Down-the-tubes finished.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.937
I can't do this anymore.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.272
Breathe... (inhales deeply)

02:18.272 --> 02:20.274
I am breathing.

02:20.274 --> 02:22.376
You're not breathing now.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.812
I'm breathing irregularly, okay?

02:24.812 --> 02:28.082
(both inhaling, exhaling)

02:28.082 --> 02:29.249
Look, it happens.

02:29.249 --> 02:30.517
l'm-l'm-l'm angry.

02:30.517 --> 02:32.686
Who are you angry with?

02:32.686 --> 02:34.054
Your wife?

02:34.054 --> 02:36.352
Oh, no,
I'm done with that folly.

02:39.126 --> 02:42.029
I'm angry at her.

02:42.029 --> 02:43.530
Who are you talking to?

02:43.530 --> 02:45.199
He's talking to the floor.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.934
Maybe he doesn't like
the carpet.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.135
I'm talking to you, Claire.

02:48.135 --> 02:51.138
The way you just stand there
and stare.

02:51.138 --> 02:54.608
How am I supposed to deal
with such total passivity?

02:54.608 --> 02:57.168
Tell her what you want.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.318
I want her to give a damn!

03:04.318 --> 03:06.153
"You"-- I want "you."

03:06.153 --> 03:07.721
I want you to bestow

03:07.721 --> 03:10.324
a little humanity
on this enterprise.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.392
Not once in a while.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.561
Show some vital signs.

03:14.561 --> 03:16.530
He's right.
You've been standing there

03:16.530 --> 03:18.298
for weeks, like a voyeur.

03:18.298 --> 03:19.466
She's beautiful.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.969
It's her license to offend.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.471
How do you feel
about that, Claire?

03:24.471 --> 03:27.441
It's uncomfortable.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.275
"It's"?

03:28.275 --> 03:32.412
I'm uncomfortable.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.314
You don't feel a thing.

03:34.314 --> 03:37.651
I don't show emotion.

03:37.651 --> 03:40.621
You're making yourself
and the rest of us nutso.

03:40.621 --> 03:42.389
What are you worried about,
Claire?

03:42.389 --> 03:44.191
Let yourself go.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.056
As a public service?

03:50.631 --> 03:51.893
I don't do that.

04:02.176 --> 04:04.235
(clattering)

04:13.220 --> 04:15.222
CLAIRE:
Stupid, stupid.

04:15.222 --> 04:18.625
I should not have joined
the group.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.060
It seemed like a good idea.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.529
The material was so rich.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.598
What are you worried about,
Claire?

04:24.598 --> 04:26.600
Let yourself go.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.058
CLAIRE:
They know something is wrong.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.254
WOMAN: Pretty white artist--
ﬁve-feet-three,

04:47.254 --> 04:49.356
successful and fun-loving,

04:49.356 --> 04:51.425
needs slightly submissive
sexy man...

04:51.425 --> 04:53.527
WOMAN 2: Desirable woman
with creativity and depth.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.696
-Hurt by Iove's roving eye...
-(various overlapping voices)

04:55.696 --> 04:58.532
LEE: Gorgeous television actor
with ﬁrm, athletic body seeks

04:58.532 --> 05:01.301
attractive, passionate,
adventurous, uninhibited female

05:01.301 --> 05:04.004
for midnight drives
in my sports car.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.739
Any age okay.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.274
You changed!

05:07.274 --> 05:09.743
CLAIRE:
They frighten me.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.078
All their anger.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.380
I wanted to tear your heart out!

05:13.380 --> 05:15.916
CLAIRE:
How primitive they are.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.247
Faster.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.554
I don't fool these creatures.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.289
I try to be like them--

05:22.289 --> 05:25.459
I replicate their looks
and gestures, but...

05:25.459 --> 05:28.257
they know I am different.

05:29.796 --> 05:32.162
Stop.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.739
(clicking repeatedly)

05:38.739 --> 05:42.009
CLAIRE:
I photograph everything.

05:42.009 --> 05:45.846
Trying to understand
the natives,

05:45.846 --> 05:49.646
what it is to be human.

05:52.686 --> 05:56.556
Everything is ﬁlled
with mystery.

05:56.556 --> 06:00.294
Each building, each face.

06:00.294 --> 06:02.129
(siren wails,
distant explosion)

06:02.129 --> 06:05.565
The city... the sky...

06:06.566 --> 06:09.303
...this alien body I inhabit.

06:09.303 --> 06:11.134
(clicking repeatedly)

06:12.139 --> 06:14.164
I am alone.

06:15.676 --> 06:19.479
Surrounded
by mysterious surfaces.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.845
(doorbell rings)

06:22.883 --> 06:25.185
Yes?

06:25.185 --> 06:28.086
AMY (muffled):
It's Amy. From group.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.735
Hi.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.904
I'm so sorry to barge in,

06:43.904 --> 06:45.439
but your phone was busy.

06:45.439 --> 06:47.600
The operator said
it was off the hook.

06:49.609 --> 06:51.907
My!

06:55.349 --> 06:58.250
What a lovely space.

06:59.286 --> 07:02.356
Oh, well...

07:02.356 --> 07:05.025
Frankly,
I was worried about you.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.516
The group can be
a bit rough sometimes.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.565
Ye-Yes.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.166
I hope you don't mind too much

07:13.166 --> 07:15.502
or take it personally,
for God's sake.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.071
Sometimes people put up
violent defenses,

07:18.071 --> 07:21.508
when they're just about
to face their real problems,

07:21.508 --> 07:24.678
and strong emotions
can be so frightening.

07:24.678 --> 07:26.680
But the shouting and the tears

07:26.680 --> 07:29.049
are all part of the work.

07:29.049 --> 07:33.153
Anyway, I hope
we'll see you next time?

07:33.153 --> 07:34.955
Yes!

07:34.955 --> 07:38.191
(chuckling):
Oh, good, I'm so glad.

07:38.191 --> 07:40.293
CLAIRE:
I lied to her.

07:40.293 --> 07:43.023
Till next week, then?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.497
Bye.

07:48.502 --> 07:49.636
No!

07:49.636 --> 07:52.773
I can't go back.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.941
The group is dangerous
to my mission.

07:54.941 --> 07:56.977
They can draw me out,
expose me.

07:56.977 --> 08:01.748
I must... I must photograph
everything,

08:01.748 --> 08:04.451
collect images of the natives.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.510
Start.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.856
They huddle together
in huge cities.

08:17.731 --> 08:21.292
They huddle together,
but they're still alone.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.845
They fear loneliness...

08:31.845 --> 08:34.211
the way they fear death.

08:37.217 --> 08:41.321
(doorbell rings)

08:41.321 --> 08:42.689
Yes?

08:42.689 --> 08:44.680
LEE:
It's Lee. From group.

08:56.336 --> 09:00.807
(latch rattles,
door creaks open)

09:00.807 --> 09:04.140
I came to apologize,
if it's not too late.

09:06.012 --> 09:07.981
I said some off-the-wall things.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.283
Who knows
where that stuff comes from?

09:10.283 --> 09:14.154
I mean, I'm on this wild roll
because my life is a shambles.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.723
lfl hurt you, I'm sorry.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.714
We all want you back.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.197
This is an amazing place.

09:40.046 --> 09:42.349
Hmm, so...

09:42.349 --> 09:43.884
how is life in the arts?

09:43.884 --> 09:45.852
Looks like you do well.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.685
You look good.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.393
You're a photographer, right?

09:53.393 --> 09:55.629
Yes.

09:55.629 --> 09:57.631
Now, that's a major commitment.

09:57.631 --> 09:59.933
My ex-wife-- we're separated.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.835
She will be my ex-wife
in a couple of months,

10:01.835 --> 10:03.036
so I'm notjumping the gun.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.939
She took these courses
in the visual arts.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.341
It revolutionized
my entire outlook.

10:08.341 --> 10:10.977
With that horror show
between us, there was still

10:10.977 --> 10:13.912
a subterranean
educational process going on.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.751
I go to galleries on weekends.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.153
Just to relax, you know?

10:20.153 --> 10:23.423
I mean, it's hard being
continuously insensitive.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.325
You go with her?

10:25.325 --> 10:26.326
Who, my ex?

10:26.326 --> 10:27.561
Oh, no, no.

10:27.561 --> 10:29.896
I tried taking Janine
from group.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.131
We met on a soap opera.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.567
l was the doctor,
she was my nurse.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.402
Didn't work out.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.970
I mean, in real life.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.272
Hey, tell me something.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.941
Are you seeing anybody?

10:40.941 --> 10:43.677
No.

10:43.677 --> 10:48.080
Oh, well, maybe we could go
to a gallery, pal around...

10:51.484 --> 10:54.221
No.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.823
No?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.825
That's kind of definite.

10:58.825 --> 11:01.020
Doesn't leave a lot of room
for interpretation.

11:03.630 --> 11:06.599
Hey, just a goof.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.075
Just think about group.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.943
That's the main thing.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.672
Group.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.582
(door clunks,
latch rattles)

11:26.786 --> 11:30.156
CLAIRE:
Few of the natives are alive.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.058
One in a hundred.

11:32.058 --> 11:35.428
The rest repeat their behavior
in a routine,

11:35.428 --> 11:37.297
like sleepwalkers.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.532
(cheering and whistling)

11:39.532 --> 11:42.902
The mass of people
are half alive.

11:42.902 --> 11:44.638
They live unconsciously.

11:44.638 --> 11:48.575
They hate being together,
and fear being alone,

11:48.575 --> 11:51.177
so they sink into deadness.

11:51.177 --> 11:54.481
It's their defense.

11:54.481 --> 11:55.749
(click)

11:55.749 --> 11:57.183
WOMAN (on TV):
Are you telling me

11:57.183 --> 11:58.652
not to have the baby?

11:58.652 --> 12:01.721
CLAIRE: The natives enjoy
one-way picture communication.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.691
MAN (on TV): I thought I could
be cold-blooded and selfish.

12:04.691 --> 12:06.259
Well, maybe I'm not so tough.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.894
Maybe I learned a few things.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.429
CLAIRE:
Stories of wish fulﬁllment.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.098
MAN (on TV):
I know I want you and that child

12:12.098 --> 12:13.667
more than anything
in this world.

12:13.667 --> 12:15.535
CLAIRE: They dream the dreams
of others.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.936
WOMAN (on TV):
What about Sybil?

12:16.936 --> 12:19.205
MAN (on TV): My wife
and I haven't touched each other

12:19.205 --> 12:20.674
in six months.

12:20.674 --> 12:23.510
CLAIRE:
Who dictates these images?

12:23.510 --> 12:28.615
Food, lingerie, cars,
furs, rocks,

12:28.615 --> 12:31.117
things, things,

12:31.117 --> 12:34.788
things, things, things!

12:34.788 --> 12:38.986
Advertising tells the natives
what to value.

12:47.067 --> 12:50.298
This is their antidote
for solitude.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.057
(sultry jazz theme playing)

13:42.655 --> 13:45.123
I need... contact.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.894
I should have invited him in.

14:02.308 --> 14:04.299
Love it.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.469
Love it!

14:08.882 --> 14:10.884
You know, in the bar,

14:10.884 --> 14:12.977
I knew you were
some sort of artist.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.612
Photography, huh?

14:18.091 --> 14:20.321
Well, you can take my picture
some time.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.731
You know...

14:24.731 --> 14:27.029
you have a great look.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.692
And you don't talk much.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.465
I can get into that.

14:39.779 --> 14:42.179
CLAIRE: My training
prepared me for this.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.210
It was no problem
physiologically.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.293
They have an expression here.

14:59.098 --> 15:02.864
"Losing... your... mind. "

15:08.308 --> 15:10.844
(crying):
I wanted to be, you know...

15:10.844 --> 15:14.247
a good little girl,

15:14.247 --> 15:16.306
but my father used me.

15:17.650 --> 15:19.552
And the thing is...

15:19.552 --> 15:21.543
I still miss him.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.525
Whatever he did to me,

15:25.525 --> 15:27.994
I still want to hear...

15:27.994 --> 15:30.663
(crying):
that he loves me.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.654
(woman sobbing)

15:36.302 --> 15:38.827
This is dangerous.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.243
WOMAN:
Oddly enough, I have this friend

15:43.243 --> 15:46.212
who teaches a course
in self-actualization.

15:46.212 --> 15:49.649
Now he also teaches a course
in the uncanny.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.385
I know exactly where
you were coming from back there.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.376
Don't touch me!

15:55.755 --> 15:58.280
I want to show you my work.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.158
LEE:
I love it.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.436
LEE: It's like you're reporting
on the whole culture.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.610
You don't have anybody
in your life, do you?

16:17.610 --> 16:19.612
Anybody close?

16:19.612 --> 16:21.347
(Claire sighs)

16:21.347 --> 16:22.507
You're an observer.

16:26.352 --> 16:28.081
Must be terribly lonely.

16:31.024 --> 16:33.356
Do you know
what's going on here?

16:52.412 --> 16:55.108
CLAIRE:
Nothing prepared me for this.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.653
That...

17:00.653 --> 17:04.157
creatures who are so violent...

17:04.157 --> 17:06.591
can be so tender.

17:16.936 --> 17:20.006
I want you to put your mother
on the cushion...

17:20.006 --> 17:21.997
and talk to her.

17:24.177 --> 17:27.908
Are you frightened
of doing that?

17:33.319 --> 17:35.788
What scares you?

17:35.788 --> 17:37.223
I could lose control.

17:37.223 --> 17:38.725
Trust me.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.661
I'll be here.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.425
You don't have to do it
if you don't want to.

17:54.374 --> 17:56.909
I'd like you
to put your mother there,

17:56.909 --> 17:59.412
and, uh,

17:59.412 --> 18:01.981
try this line:

18:01.981 --> 18:04.150
You never loved me...

18:04.150 --> 18:06.141
enough.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.490
Does that fit for you?

18:10.490 --> 18:12.225
CLAIRE:
I never knew her.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.327
It's absurd.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.096
Go on.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.564
See what happens.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.104
You never loved me enough.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.038
Again.

18:30.176 --> 18:32.311
You never loved me enough.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.113
Really tell her.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.172
Let go.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.241
(laughs)

18:40.486 --> 18:42.579
(voice breaking):
You never loved me enough.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.748
(crying):
You never loved me enough!

18:47.326 --> 18:49.796
You never loved me enough!

18:49.796 --> 18:53.366
You never
loved me enough!

18:53.366 --> 18:55.868
You never loved me enough!

18:55.868 --> 18:58.359
(sobbing)

19:01.708 --> 19:03.198
(sobbing continues)

19:04.911 --> 19:08.779
CLAIRE:
They have... an... expression.

19:10.116 --> 19:16.021
"Losing... your... mind. "

19:22.195 --> 19:23.362
(knocking on door)

19:23.362 --> 19:25.131
LEE:
Yes.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.467
CLAIRE:
I must talk to you.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.235
I don't know what's happening.

19:29.235 --> 19:31.270
What is it?

19:31.270 --> 19:32.672
(sighing)

19:32.672 --> 19:34.697
(Claire yelling)

19:36.242 --> 19:38.377
(Claire yells,
Lee mutters)

19:38.377 --> 19:41.981
(Claire yelling)

19:41.981 --> 19:43.972
(Claire gasps)

19:47.653 --> 19:50.123
(Claire gasps)

19:50.123 --> 19:51.791
CLAIRE:
I've ruined

19:51.791 --> 19:53.159
everything, like a animal.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.695
A stupid, human animal.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.263
Why do you say that, Claire?

19:57.263 --> 19:59.398
Because I can feel now.

19:59.398 --> 20:00.833
Everything that you feel.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.169
I'm just like you!

20:03.169 --> 20:05.104
That's why you're here...

20:05.104 --> 20:07.173
No! I'm not one of you.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.709
I'm supposed to report on you.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.511
You feel different from us?

20:11.511 --> 20:13.179
I am.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.681
I come from... far away.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.383
You wouldn't understand.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.051
Oh, Claire.

20:19.051 --> 20:21.788
We all feel that way
from time to time.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.189
No!

20:23.189 --> 20:25.458
I can never go home.

20:25.458 --> 20:28.094
None of us can go back
to the past,

20:28.094 --> 20:31.097
and we all feel alienated
occasionally.

20:31.097 --> 20:34.967
I am not from this world.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.637
I don't belong here!

20:37.637 --> 20:39.305
But you are here.

20:39.305 --> 20:40.840
(Claire sighs)

20:40.840 --> 20:43.242
And we have to go on growing.

20:43.242 --> 20:47.814
What you feel is just
a simple human reaction.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.216
(crying):
No! No!

20:50.216 --> 20:51.851
No...!

20:51.851 --> 20:53.553
No!

20:53.553 --> 20:56.923
(overlapping, echoing):
No! No! No! No...!

20:56.923 --> 20:58.825
CLAIRE:
My mission is over.

20:58.825 --> 21:01.327
I know
what these creatures feel.

21:01.327 --> 21:03.830
Solitude.

21:03.830 --> 21:07.288
That is what it is to be human.

21:16.509 --> 21:20.313
NARRATOR:
The dark side is always there.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.849
Waiting for us to enter.

21:22.849 --> 21:26.085
Waiting to enter us.

21:26.085 --> 21:32.320
Until next time,
try to enjoy the daylight.
