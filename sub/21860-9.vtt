00:08.209 --> 00:10.744

00:13.013 --> 00:15.683
ANNOUNCER:
FX presents Better Things.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.490
(crying)

00:22.523 --> 00:25.059
Dude, stop crying.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.227
SAM:
What's wrong?

00:26.260 --> 00:27.561
What happened?

00:27.595 --> 00:29.163
This is fake.
She's faking.

00:29.197 --> 00:30.664
She started when she heard
your car pull up.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.367
Duke, tell Mommy
why you're crying.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.002
Mom, I need to talk to you.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.004
Duke, stop crying
or I'm gonna

00:37.037 --> 00:38.406
beat the shit
out of you.

00:38.439 --> 00:39.840
Frankie!
MAX: Mom!

00:39.873 --> 00:41.242
SAM
What?

00:41.275 --> 00:42.443
Harvey got Paisley pregnant.

00:42.476 --> 00:43.677
What?

00:43.711 --> 00:44.912
She thinks she's pregnant

00:44.945 --> 00:47.281
and she had sex with Harvey.

00:47.315 --> 00:50.017
Ew.
Mom!

00:50.050 --> 00:52.586
Harvey.
Blech.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.522
* Mother

00:54.555 --> 00:58.025
* You had me

00:58.058 --> 01:00.761
* But I never had you

01:02.896 --> 01:04.665
*

01:06.934 --> 01:10.804
* I wanted you

01:12.473 --> 01:15.476
* You didn't want me.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.813
*

01:19.847 --> 01:22.783
(classical music playing)

01:22.816 --> 01:24.818
(phone ringing)

01:30.023 --> 01:31.925
Hello?

01:31.959 --> 01:33.261
Oh, Sam.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.995
Hello.
WOMAN: Who is it?

01:35.028 --> 01:36.997
It's Sam.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.167
Hmm?

01:39.200 --> 01:40.568
Yes.

01:40.601 --> 01:42.002
All welcome.

01:42.035 --> 01:43.937
Lovely.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.606
Anytime.

01:45.639 --> 01:46.974
Bye, sweetheart.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.342
Bye.

01:57.285 --> 01:59.287
(squawking)

02:08.696 --> 02:11.098
Can anyone
carry anything?

02:11.131 --> 02:13.601
I mean, I can.
Technically.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.870
Max? Max, you suck.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.372
Ha.

02:18.406 --> 02:19.940
Mom, I'll help you.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.843
No, baby. You stay.
Fun ride.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.679
Yeah, Duke, when Mom says
"Can anyone help,"

02:25.713 --> 02:27.481
she never means you.

02:27.515 --> 02:30.384
That's right,
Frankie. I don't.

02:30.418 --> 02:33.153
Ooh, totems.
Canada.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.524
Hello.
Hi, Uncle Lester.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.058
Hi.
Hello.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.660
DUKE: Hi, Aunt Jarita.
Hello.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.329
Hi.
Ah.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.964
Hello.
Hello. Mmm.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.533
Good to see you.

02:45.566 --> 02:46.700
Come on in.

02:46.734 --> 02:47.735
Thank you.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.704
Oh.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.140
I'm gonna cry.
Oh, no. Don't be daft.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.243
Oh, come on.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.077
So good to
have you here.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.912
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.881
Can this really be Frankie?

03:00.914 --> 03:02.883
(chuckles)
I'm me, yeah.

03:02.916 --> 03:04.151
Oh, you, look at you.
(grunts)

03:04.184 --> 03:05.386
SAM:
Isn't she tall?

03:05.419 --> 03:07.421
Yes.
(laughs)

03:07.455 --> 03:09.823
Max. Headphones.
Mom.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.992
No, no, no,
let her have her music.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.094
That's rude.
Come... come on,
darling.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.129
Rude.
Come on.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.868
* Hey, hey, hey, hey

03:20.901 --> 03:22.370
MAX:
I'm sorry

03:22.403 --> 03:24.438
about the headphones.
I'll take 'em off.

03:24.472 --> 03:27.441
Oh, no, don't, darling.
That's your music.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.443
Listen, I grew up
in Liverpool,

03:29.477 --> 03:32.946
and we used to go see
The Beatles twice a week.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.283
Seriously?
Yes. I even had

03:35.316 --> 03:36.950
a little snog with John,

03:36.984 --> 03:39.720
which is none of your business.

03:39.753 --> 03:42.556
Anyway, I used to
put on my records,

03:42.590 --> 03:45.626
shut my bedroom door
against my mother,

03:45.659 --> 03:48.462
and if I could have had 'em
'round my head like yourself,

03:48.496 --> 03:51.064
I would have.
So good on you.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.066
Thanks.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.068
Listen, you stay here.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.937
I'll fetch you up
your supper.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.606
No need to come down.

03:58.639 --> 04:00.708
Have your own time.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.743
Ta-ra, darling.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.882
Wait, what happened
with John Lennon?

04:08.916 --> 04:10.451
You made all
these chairs?

04:10.484 --> 04:12.286
Aye. And the table.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.088
And the roof above your head
and the floor beneath your feet.

04:15.122 --> 04:18.058
You made all of it?
Aye.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.993
I want to learn
to do that.
Well,

04:20.027 --> 04:21.895
come move up here
and be my apprentice.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.498
Yes, I would do
that in a second.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.734
Well...
(soft chuckle)

04:26.767 --> 04:29.236
...you, uh, you can't
have an apprentice

04:29.269 --> 04:32.272
unless you can
do it yourself.

04:32.306 --> 04:34.174
My hands won't let me, Frankie.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.910
That's how
life goes.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.812
You build it.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.449
And you grow old.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.151
And you die in it.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.088
(laughs)

04:48.121 --> 04:49.423
Frankie.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.592
How's Jarita's health?

04:51.625 --> 04:53.093
She's all right.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.495
Last year was tough.

04:54.528 --> 04:56.964
This has been a good one.
That's good.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.999
She looks great.
Mm-hmm.

04:59.032 --> 05:01.301
You look... all right.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.870
How's your mum?

05:03.904 --> 05:06.507
Um... she's okay.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.241
Couldn't she come with you?

05:09.242 --> 05:11.244
She, uh...

05:13.246 --> 05:15.949
Um...

05:15.983 --> 05:18.452
I didn't tell her
I was coming, Lester.

05:18.486 --> 05:21.054
I just...

05:21.088 --> 05:23.691
didn't tell her.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.329
(laughing)

05:31.732 --> 05:33.567
You didn't tell her.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.168
(laughs)

05:35.202 --> 05:38.238
That's marvelous.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.473
Oh, Sam.

05:39.507 --> 05:40.908
Had I ever the courage

05:40.941 --> 05:43.377
not to tell Phil anything.
Oh,

05:43.411 --> 05:44.978
it would have saved me
a lot of pain.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.647
(sighs) Yeah.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.215
Yeah.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.718
But promise me to
put my sister on a plane here

05:50.751 --> 05:52.720
before the year is out.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.555
Okay, I-I promise.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.391
No, no... promise me, Sam.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.393
Send her up
to see me.

05:59.427 --> 06:01.028
Just her.
I can handle her.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.663
But promise me.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.165
I do, Lester.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.267
I-I promise.

06:08.602 --> 06:09.870
I do.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.906
Cool.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.643
*

06:24.485 --> 06:28.422
* Why
* Why, why, why

06:28.456 --> 06:30.357
Oh! Get over here,

06:30.390 --> 06:32.059
you little piece of shit!

06:32.092 --> 06:34.061
(laughing)

06:34.094 --> 06:37.698
* Why
* Why, why, why

06:37.731 --> 06:41.469
* Do

06:42.470 --> 06:44.472
* We stay...

06:57.751 --> 06:59.487
Frankie.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.902
Hey.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.937
Oh!

07:27.881 --> 07:30.017
I wish I could live
on that beach.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.752
Sad Lady Beach.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.453
What? Sand Lady?

07:33.487 --> 07:35.656
Sad Lady Beach. Sad.

07:35.689 --> 07:37.124
Why do they call it that?

07:37.157 --> 07:40.360
The story is that
back in the 1800s,

07:40.393 --> 07:43.531
there was a lady
that went to that beach,

07:43.564 --> 07:47.467
she looked out at the water
for a long while...

07:47.501 --> 07:50.037
then she walked
right in front of the train,

07:50.070 --> 07:52.105
killing herself to death.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.641
Oh, my God.
Jesus,

07:53.674 --> 07:54.708
is that real?

07:54.742 --> 07:56.343
They named the beach after her.

07:56.376 --> 07:58.779
The train cut her right in two.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.948
LESTER: Oh, shut up, Jarita.
SAM: No, I want to hear

08:00.981 --> 08:03.316
about Sad Lady.
Why did she do it?

08:03.350 --> 08:04.818
No one knows.

08:04.852 --> 08:06.286
No one knew her name.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.789
No one knew where she came from.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.891
Wow.
That's crazy.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.025
I should say so.

08:12.059 --> 08:14.027
Aunt Jarita knew John Lennon.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.629
What?!

08:15.663 --> 08:16.630
Serious?

08:16.664 --> 08:19.066
Well, a little.

08:19.099 --> 08:22.202
I think everyone in Liverpool
knew a Beatle back then.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.471
What was Liverpool like?

08:24.504 --> 08:25.839
Well, it was a miserable,

08:25.873 --> 08:27.708
gray place.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.711
And it was
loads of fun for kids.
(laughs)

08:30.744 --> 08:33.747
You know, I remember one day
we all were taken out on a trip.

08:33.781 --> 08:36.650
It was me, your gran, Phyllis,

08:36.684 --> 08:38.218
my late brother Donal

08:38.251 --> 08:39.820
and Marion.
And we were taken...

08:39.853 --> 08:41.321
Wait, who's Marion?

08:41.354 --> 08:43.190
Marion.
My sister Marion.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.925
What sister Marion?

08:44.958 --> 08:46.359
My sister
Marion, dear.

08:46.393 --> 08:47.861
There was me, your mum,

08:47.895 --> 08:50.197
Donal, and Marion, the youngest.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.565
I don't understand, Lester.

08:51.599 --> 08:54.702
My mom had you
and her other brother.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.070
No, darling.
There was Marion.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.072
We were four.
Two girls, two boys.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.708
Until Donal died.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.543
Lester, Lester.
I don't understand.

09:03.577 --> 09:05.412
Oh. Oh, Christ.

09:05.445 --> 09:08.882
Uh... did I just shoot
the Pope at supper?

09:10.784 --> 09:12.886
Sam.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.922
Your mum and I have a sister.

09:19.593 --> 09:20.894
Where?

09:20.928 --> 09:23.964
Well, when she was 17,
they put...

09:23.997 --> 09:26.033
Well, she was...

09:26.066 --> 09:28.736
mentally unstable,

09:28.769 --> 09:30.237
as they say.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.872
You know.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.707
No, I don't.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.542
Anyway, I haven't
heard anything about her

09:35.575 --> 09:38.011
since they... put her there.

09:41.448 --> 09:42.950
(Sam sighs)

09:42.983 --> 09:44.985
What's going on?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.554
Your mum

09:47.587 --> 09:50.457
has an Auntie Marion
that she never knew about

09:50.490 --> 09:52.893
because her mum didn't tell her.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.795
She lived
her whole adult life

09:54.828 --> 09:56.730
in a mental institution.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.231
LESTER:
Jarita.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.433
Well, we better tell them.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.502
Phyllis never
told her,

10:02.535 --> 10:04.404
and look at her now.
Goddamn

10:04.437 --> 10:05.773
family secrets.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.775
They're poison.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.376
Let them have it.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.479
Mommy.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.184
(Sam sighs)

10:17.217 --> 10:18.819
JARITA:
She'll be all right

10:18.852 --> 10:20.453
in a minute.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.455
Eat up.
* All this wreckage...

10:22.489 --> 10:24.257
Don't let it get cold.
LESTER: Come on.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.592
Eat up.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.927
Now you've done it.

10:26.960 --> 10:30.497
* All this niceness

10:30.530 --> 10:34.601
* It's a half-life

10:34.634 --> 10:37.805
* Let me see it

10:37.838 --> 10:39.306
Hi.

10:39.339 --> 10:41.541
Frankie. I'm so mad.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.944
I'm mad at my mom.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.612
Why?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.214
Because I just found out
I have an aunt

10:47.247 --> 10:49.149
who I never even knew existed,

10:49.182 --> 10:52.119
who's probably 80
if she's even alive.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.486
So?

10:53.520 --> 10:55.555
Guess what.

10:55.588 --> 10:58.225
I have an uncle,
your brother Marion?

10:58.258 --> 11:00.160
Yeah, I never see him.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.896
I never see my
cousin Dormin.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.231
Families fall apart, Mom.

11:04.264 --> 11:05.799
It's what happens.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.535
How often do I even see
my own dad, Mom?

11:08.568 --> 11:10.670
How do you think that
makes me feel?

11:10.704 --> 11:13.907
Frankie, your father is...

11:13.941 --> 11:15.575
I don't care, Mom.

11:15.608 --> 11:18.178
Yeah, I get it.
I mean, I'm just saying.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.480
Family's just kind of bullshit.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.983
Everybody ends up alone, anyway.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.752
You know as well as I do

11:24.785 --> 11:26.353
that there's plenty of families

11:26.386 --> 11:27.855
where the parents
stayed together

11:27.888 --> 11:29.656
and everyone's miserable.

11:29.689 --> 11:33.526
Yeah, well, you guys didn't
and we're all miserable.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.396
Is that how you feel?

11:36.429 --> 11:38.665
You think we're all miserable?

11:38.698 --> 11:40.367
Not all the time, Mom.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.702
Don't make a thing out of it.
It's all fine.

11:42.736 --> 11:45.238
I'm just saying, if you're
gonna get mad at your mom,

11:45.272 --> 11:46.673
it leads to this.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.609
So just chill.

11:49.642 --> 11:53.680
* It's a half-life.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.183
MAX:
Mom.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.218
No offense,

11:58.251 --> 12:02.455
but it's kind of your fault that
Harvey's sleeping with Paisley.

12:02.489 --> 12:03.924
'Cause you don't let him
sleep in my room,

12:03.957 --> 12:05.458
and Paisley's mom lets him.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.097
(sighs)

12:18.438 --> 12:19.940
Hi.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.241
(whispering):
Hi.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.043
(whispering):
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.144
(whispering):
It's okay.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.179
Come on in.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.717
Um...

12:30.750 --> 12:34.221
Now...

12:34.254 --> 12:36.790
This is everything
I could find.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.392
There's your mum.

12:39.426 --> 12:42.996
And here's Marion and Da.

12:43.030 --> 12:47.300
She's about... five there.

12:49.136 --> 12:53.273
And Marion, she's
16 in this picture.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.179
And, uh, this is the name

12:59.212 --> 13:01.849
and the number of the place.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.817
Now, I don't expect
the number will work now,

13:03.851 --> 13:07.020
but it's something
to go on.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.656
Yeah. I...

13:09.689 --> 13:12.159
I guess I could Google it.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.329
Oh, I'm sorry, Sam.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.832
I just thought your mum
might have told you.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.934
Hmm.

13:20.968 --> 13:24.571
Do you ever think about her?

13:25.805 --> 13:28.108
(sighs)

13:28.141 --> 13:30.978
You never met your
grandparents, did you?

13:31.011 --> 13:32.545
No.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.181
They died so young.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.849
Aye, they did.

13:35.883 --> 13:39.186
After Donal died,

13:39.219 --> 13:41.688
we never said his name again.

13:41.721 --> 13:44.791
And when Marion

13:44.824 --> 13:47.794
couldn't be managed any longer,

13:47.827 --> 13:49.662
they sent her away.

13:49.696 --> 13:54.634
And then your mum
married a Jewish man,

13:54.667 --> 13:57.437
and she was shut out.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.209
I suppose I got used to it.

14:04.211 --> 14:07.714
I'll, uh,
I'll leave this here.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.482
See you in the morning.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.384
You sleep well, okay?

14:19.626 --> 14:21.628
(sighs)

14:29.802 --> 14:32.205
(sighs)

14:37.244 --> 14:39.279
Why do we have to go
to an effing museum?

14:39.312 --> 14:43.183
Because you should learn
about the places you visit.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.186
And also, when you visit
older people,

14:46.219 --> 14:49.456
it's nice to give them a break
the day after you arrive.

14:49.489 --> 14:52.025
Because we're a lot.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.460
I was just transferred to you.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.794
Do you know about the thing?

14:54.827 --> 14:57.630
Or do I have to...

14:57.664 --> 15:01.568
Okay. I would like to be able
to call England,

15:01.601 --> 15:04.704
but my phone says I don't have
international calling,

15:04.737 --> 15:06.239
but I'm in Canada,

15:06.273 --> 15:09.476
and my phone's American.

15:09.509 --> 15:13.046
Yes. I would like you
to be able to help me,

15:13.080 --> 15:15.548
please, let my phone
call England.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.884
No, no, no.
Not from home, from here.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.752
Unless you want me
to give you the number

15:19.786 --> 15:21.588
of the place and you can call
and find out

15:21.621 --> 15:24.657
if my crazy auntie is dead
or not, and then let me know.

15:24.691 --> 15:26.626
No?

15:26.659 --> 15:28.128
(traditional
Native American singing plays)
Now, these artifacts

15:28.161 --> 15:29.796
are great examples
of household items

15:29.829 --> 15:32.665
that were used amongst the
different coastal tribes.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.334
Here we have a totem pole.
(singing continues)

15:34.367 --> 15:36.236
Now, totem poles

15:36.269 --> 15:38.305
are used for different things,

15:38.338 --> 15:40.407
but mostly to mark homes,

15:40.440 --> 15:42.909
to let you know which
family lived in what house,

15:42.942 --> 15:44.978
and their family stories.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.314
This family here represents

15:47.347 --> 15:49.016
the chief of the seas,

15:49.049 --> 15:50.917
which means wealth
and prosperity.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.519
Which means this was a very

15:52.552 --> 15:55.522
wealthy house to visit.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.358
You took this from my people.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.261
All of this belongs
to my family!

16:01.294 --> 16:03.296
That chair belonged
to my grandmother.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.631
DOCENT:
This particular mask...

16:04.664 --> 16:07.767
Our grandmothers are vanishing.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.270
This is our legacy.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.105
DOCENT:
Let's move on, shall we?

16:12.139 --> 16:14.141
(singing continues)

16:23.983 --> 16:25.185
SAM:
Duke.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.186
Come on. We're leaving.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.487
LESTER:
The trick is,

16:27.520 --> 16:30.623
put the net
where he wants to go.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.026
They're too clever
to be caught.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.795
The only way to catch them
is to tell their future.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.064
Now, you see him?

16:37.097 --> 16:38.665
Wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.867
Now, there you go.
There you go-- Oh.

16:40.900 --> 16:42.035
Oh, nearly, Frankie.
(laughs)

16:42.069 --> 16:43.736
Damn it. I
had that one.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.172
Come.
Let's do it again.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.307
* Last night

16:47.340 --> 16:50.243
* I stumbled onto heaven...

16:50.277 --> 16:53.046
Oh.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.348
I just caught some
very nice seaweed.

16:55.382 --> 16:58.651
Ooh, we should keep that.

16:58.685 --> 17:02.089
The worst part is seeing
all my friends get smarter.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.191
I'm so stupid.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.193
Oh, listen.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.162
If there's one thing
stupid people are good at,

17:09.196 --> 17:12.432
is recognizing
other stupid people.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.235
And take it from me,
you're not one of them.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.003
I feel stupid.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.771
That's because
you're aware.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.773
And you're starting
to catch a glimpse

17:20.807 --> 17:24.344
of what a big world you're in
and you feel small.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.747
That's all right,
you'll get used to it.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.286
Yes. Do you see him?

17:33.320 --> 17:34.887
There you go.
There you go.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.923
Ooh. Oh, almost, Frankie.
(phone beeps)

17:36.956 --> 17:39.692
WOMAN:
Mann Institute. Can I help you?

17:39.726 --> 17:41.761
Hi. Yes. I'm calling...

17:41.794 --> 17:43.763
(exhales)

17:43.796 --> 17:45.765
I'm sorry.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.201
I'm nervous. Whew.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.737
I don't know why. Huh.

17:50.770 --> 17:54.241
Um, I have an aunt,
Marion Darby,

17:54.274 --> 17:56.876
who was put in your place,

17:56.909 --> 17:59.112
which was then called Rosewood,

17:59.146 --> 18:01.281
back when she was 17,

18:01.314 --> 18:03.750
back, like, in the '40s,

18:03.783 --> 18:05.785
by my grandparents.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.989
(sighs) And I just found out
she even existed,

18:10.022 --> 18:12.058
which I never knew.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.060
I'm just trying to find her.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.762
For what reason
are you inquiring?

18:15.795 --> 18:17.230
What are you after?

18:17.264 --> 18:20.066
Look, uh, what's your name,
please?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.635
I'm Letty.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.671
I'm Sam.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.673
Listen, Letty.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.075
I don't want anything.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.311
I just didn't know
I had an aunt.

18:31.344 --> 18:34.647
Huh.
My mom didn't tell me.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.150
I guess they just shut her away,
and put her there,

18:37.184 --> 18:39.419
and left her there,
and forgot her.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.422
Honestly, I don't know
why I'm calling.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.292
I mean, I got three kids,
I work, I have a mom

18:45.325 --> 18:49.262
who's a full-time job
just to listen to. (sighs)

18:49.296 --> 18:51.030
I just, uh, I would like to know

18:51.063 --> 18:54.534
if someone over there needs me.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.303
Or something, I think.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.704
I don't know, Letty.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.672
Should I just hang up now?

18:59.706 --> 19:01.508
Tell you what, love.
Call me back tomorrow,

19:01.541 --> 19:03.210
and I'll have something for you,
all right?

19:03.243 --> 19:05.478
Okay. Great.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.947
Thank you so much, Letty.

19:07.980 --> 19:11.518
What was it like?

19:11.551 --> 19:14.221
He was a lousy kisser,

19:14.254 --> 19:15.955
and he never stopped talking.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.490
A real bore.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.192
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

19:19.226 --> 19:22.128
*

19:22.161 --> 19:24.297
Duke!

19:24.331 --> 19:25.865
Come on over here.

19:25.898 --> 19:28.835
That's enough with being
on your own.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.172
Okay, they go that way.
Go, go, Frankie.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.007
Yeah, you got him!
You got him!

19:35.041 --> 19:37.544
Well done.
(laughs)

19:37.577 --> 19:39.812
Oh. Look,
they've caught a fish.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.482
Mom! I caught
a fucking fish!

19:42.515 --> 19:44.717
Oh!

19:44.751 --> 19:47.387
(laughing):
Frankie!

19:47.420 --> 19:51.224
(laughing):
Supper! Frankie caught supper.

19:52.859 --> 19:56.162
Amazing.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.830
Oh, my God.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.699
FRANKIE:
I touched it.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.504
Oh, shit. That
smells amazing.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.739
Mmm.

20:06.773 --> 20:09.008
I'm gonna eat it
out of the pan.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.377
Off it.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.878
It's nothing now.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.046
It needs another
20 minutes at least.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.115
No way! I'm gonna
eat it right now.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.149
Off.
(grunting)

20:19.486 --> 20:20.787
Oh. Those.
Mm-hmm?

20:20.820 --> 20:22.822
I've seen those...
somewhere.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.258
Right here.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.026
Mm. "Colitiamite daisy."

20:27.059 --> 20:29.462
They get the name
from the mineral in the soil,

20:29.496 --> 20:31.464
which gives them that color.

20:31.498 --> 20:34.467
Those were once
all over the bay,

20:34.501 --> 20:36.769
bushes of them growing wild.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.005
But there are none left.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.642
These are the last ones
I ever saw.

20:44.344 --> 20:47.780
(chuckles): They've been dead
in that vase for two years.

20:49.015 --> 20:51.117
Where did they all go?

20:51.150 --> 20:52.785
Well...

20:52.819 --> 20:54.721
the bees.

20:54.754 --> 20:58.525
There are no more bees,
so the daisies go.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.595
Once those turn to dust...

21:02.629 --> 21:04.764
that'll be it.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.771
*

21:14.841 --> 21:16.843
(sighs)

21:25.885 --> 21:27.354
* Wheat fields

21:27.387 --> 21:30.623
* Begin to sway, and
(line ringing)

21:30.657 --> 21:32.692
* Slow tears falling...

21:32.725 --> 21:35.161
Letty speaking.

21:35.194 --> 21:38.097
Hi, Letty.
This is Sam from yesterday.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.098
Hi, Sam.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.667
Hi.

21:40.700 --> 21:44.504
Sam, I want to apologize
for being cagey when you called.

21:44.537 --> 21:48.107
Understand that people
are often left here for years,

21:48.140 --> 21:50.510
and sometimes when distant
family comes sniffing around,

21:50.543 --> 21:52.144
it's for bad reasons.

21:52.178 --> 21:53.713
You understand?

21:53.746 --> 21:55.815
Sure. Sure.

21:57.083 --> 21:58.284
Well, I...

21:58.317 --> 21:59.318
Sam,

21:59.352 --> 22:03.255
your Aunt Marion died in 1983.

22:05.191 --> 22:08.060
Huh.

22:08.094 --> 22:09.729
Hmm.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.664
I was in high school.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.299
I'm sorry, Sam.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.001
(sighs)

22:15.034 --> 22:19.839
Well, is there anything else
you can tell me about her?

22:19.872 --> 22:21.641
I'm afraid I didn't know her,

22:21.674 --> 22:24.677
and a lot of the staff that
were there then are gone now.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.580
I asked this fellow
who cleans here,

22:27.614 --> 22:30.583
who's been here for ages,
but he couldn't recall her.

22:30.617 --> 22:32.385
So, then...

22:32.419 --> 22:34.821
everyone forgot her.

22:34.854 --> 22:38.157
Well, you didn't, did you?

22:38.190 --> 22:40.527
(sighs)

22:40.560 --> 22:43.430
How can you forget someone
you never knew?

22:43.463 --> 22:44.997
I'm sorry, Sam.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.734
Would you like me to send you
her file folder?

22:47.767 --> 22:50.537
No. No,
you should keep it there.

22:50.570 --> 22:53.406
Someone else
might come looking for her.

22:53.440 --> 22:56.175
Well, we are going digital, so
we're likely to throw it away.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.878
Okay, throw it away, then.
But if you give me

22:58.911 --> 23:00.913
your address,
I can pop it in the post.

23:00.947 --> 23:02.181
No.

23:02.214 --> 23:04.050
It's fine. Toss it.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.852
And, um...

23:05.885 --> 23:07.386
thanks, Letty.

23:07.420 --> 23:10.457
Just... thank you very much.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.724
All right, love.

23:11.758 --> 23:15.261
*

23:15.294 --> 23:17.964
* Hey, hey, hey, hey

23:20.099 --> 23:24.103
* Hey, hey, hey, hey.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.371
There you go, sweetie.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.372
MAX:
Thanks.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.207
Find anything out?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.942
Yeah.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.144
Your sister's dead.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.480
Mom.

23:33.513 --> 23:34.981
Well, I thought

23:35.014 --> 23:38.217
everyone tells everybody
everything now. What?

23:38.250 --> 23:40.653
Let him have it.
Right, Jarita?

23:46.192 --> 23:48.060
(chuckling)

23:48.094 --> 23:50.396
(snickers)

23:50.429 --> 23:54.601
LESTER (laughing):
Oh, Sam. Oh, Sam.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.603
You're gonna give me
another five years.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.571
(Jarita laughing)

23:58.605 --> 24:01.273
You're a delight.

24:01.307 --> 24:03.643
Oh, my goodness,
why am I laughing?

24:03.676 --> 24:05.244
Oh, my God.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.680
Thank God.

24:07.714 --> 24:09.916
(laughter continues)

24:09.949 --> 24:11.651
LESTER:
Why am I laughing?

24:11.684 --> 24:12.919
You have to.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.621
Because you have to.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.455
You have to.

24:16.489 --> 24:19.626
(laughter continues)

24:19.659 --> 24:22.862
(laughter stops)
Ah.

24:22.895 --> 24:25.097
So, when did she die, Sam?

24:25.131 --> 24:28.034
1983, apparently.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.602
'83?

24:29.636 --> 24:31.037
That's the year we moved here.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.505
Aye.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.541
Oh, my goodness,
you don't suppose...

24:34.574 --> 24:36.643
No, no,
chut-chut-chut-chut-chut.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.611
What?

24:38.645 --> 24:41.180
When we first
moved here,

24:41.213 --> 24:43.382
Lester used to think
he saw a ghost

24:43.415 --> 24:44.651
now and again.

24:44.684 --> 24:49.055
Perhaps it was old
Marion haunting me.

24:49.088 --> 24:52.324
Maybe. Maybe.
Mm-hmm.

24:52.358 --> 24:53.359
Creepy.

24:53.392 --> 24:54.661
Serves me right,
I suppose.

24:54.694 --> 24:58.064
SAM: Yes, Lester,
serves you right.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.435
Mom, can we please
come back here in the summer?

25:04.571 --> 25:06.038
Really?

25:07.206 --> 25:09.742
Yeah. I love it here.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.510
Oh, baby...
Mom, don't.

25:11.544 --> 25:13.813
Okay.

25:13.846 --> 25:17.483
Do you guys have a living will
by any chance? No reason.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.485
My God, Mom.
JARITA: Yes.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.688
You do?
LESTER AND JARITA:
Mm-hmm.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.322
Do tell.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.091
LESTER:
You might have to wait...

25:25.124 --> 25:28.260
Tu-tu-tuy.
JARITA:
Tu-tu-tuy-tuy, indeed.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.662
Cheers.
Cheers, cheers,
everyone.

25:29.696 --> 25:31.263
Cheers.
Cheers.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.066
Next time you come, there
will be a small charge.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.702
(laughter)

25:36.736 --> 25:38.738
*

25:47.880 --> 25:51.017
* Girl, you know it's fine...

25:51.050 --> 25:52.952
JARITA:
Don't forget to write us.

25:52.985 --> 25:55.421
Do you have e-mail?
No. I'm afraid you're
gonna have to learn

25:55.454 --> 25:57.123
to use a pencil.
LESTER:
Frankie.

25:58.157 --> 25:59.759
Now...

26:01.260 --> 26:02.729
These...

26:02.762 --> 26:04.396
are the chairs.

26:04.430 --> 26:06.532
I wanted to make a set,

26:06.565 --> 26:09.435
so this is the only time
I made a blueprint.

26:09.468 --> 26:12.905
Now, if you can teach
yourself to work with wood,

26:12.939 --> 26:16.976
you can use these, and you can
make exactly the same chairs

26:17.009 --> 26:18.878
as we have here.

26:18.911 --> 26:20.613
It's like a recipe.

26:20.647 --> 26:23.115
(sobbing)

26:24.817 --> 26:27.754
Oh...

26:28.788 --> 26:30.156
Duke?

26:30.189 --> 26:31.724
(clears throat)

26:31.758 --> 26:33.793
* If what they're holding's

26:33.826 --> 26:37.063
* Too heavy now, baby

26:37.096 --> 26:38.297
(sobs)

26:38.330 --> 26:42.301
* You can lay it on me

26:42.334 --> 26:45.237
* I can't wait until you

26:45.271 --> 26:47.439
* Believe

26:51.310 --> 26:53.079
Hi.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.347
Um...

26:55.381 --> 26:58.350
I don't know
if you're here right now

26:58.384 --> 27:01.020
or if you're real

27:01.053 --> 27:03.656
or if I made you up

27:03.690 --> 27:06.458
or if you're dead

27:06.492 --> 27:08.995
or if you're the sad lady

27:09.028 --> 27:11.463
or if you're Aunt Marion,

27:11.497 --> 27:14.801
but I brought you these flowers.

27:14.834 --> 27:18.771
And I wanted to just say
that I hope you're okay

27:18.805 --> 27:20.940
and that you can not be sad

27:20.973 --> 27:23.009
and that you feel better.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.044
*

27:27.646 --> 27:30.182
And I'm not scared of you.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.659
Thanks.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.531
SAM:
Duke?

27:45.564 --> 27:47.299
Come on.

27:47.333 --> 27:49.035
We're leaving.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.870
Come on.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.939

No, Mom, I got it.

28:13.092 --> 28:14.193
Really?

28:14.226 --> 28:15.194
Uh-huh.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.929
Thank you.

28:25.271 --> 28:26.739
Uh...

28:30.609 --> 28:31.778

28:31.811 --> 28:33.645
Hello.

28:34.646 --> 28:36.248
Hi.

Hello?

Hi, Mom.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.567
Hi.

28:55.601 --> 28:57.837
Where have
you all been?

29:03.075 --> 29:05.411
Where have you all
just come from?

29:05.444 --> 29:07.814
Um...

29:09.348 --> 29:11.417
W-We went to White Rock

29:11.450 --> 29:13.853
to see Lester and Jarita.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.890
You went to see my brother?

29:17.924 --> 29:19.091
Yeah, Mom.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.627
We were there for three days.

29:21.660 --> 29:23.930
It was amazing.

29:35.808 --> 29:38.477
* We were sailing along

29:40.712 --> 29:43.983
* On Moonlight Bay

29:45.551 --> 29:49.488
* We could hear
the voices ringing *

29:50.957 --> 29:54.026
* They seemed to say

29:56.128 --> 29:58.630
* You have stolen her heart

29:58.664 --> 30:01.033
* You have stolen
her heart *

30:01.067 --> 30:03.836
* Now don't go 'way

30:03.870 --> 30:06.772
* Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

30:06.805 --> 30:08.975
* As we sang

30:09.008 --> 30:12.945
* Love's old sweet songs

30:12.979 --> 30:16.883
* On Moonlight Bay

30:16.916 --> 30:21.053

a Syrian refugee baby?

30:36.535 --> 30:38.737
No!
They're dying
every day.

murdering a baby
