at the height
of his Beatles fame.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.389
It was a classic
fatal-attraction situation.

16:29.422 --> 16:30.557
I had to do two things.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.325
One -- get through
the next 10 minutes

16:32.359 --> 16:34.227
'til the deadline to drop
my class had passed

16:34.261 --> 16:36.296
by distracting her
with light banter

16:36.329 --> 16:38.831
and enjoying her Tuscan cooking,
and, two --

16:38.865 --> 16:42.001
check to see if she had beaten
and restrained Claire.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.903
I'm not coming on
too strongly,

16:43.936 --> 16:45.538
am I,
with this dress?

16:45.572 --> 16:47.207
Oh. No.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.342
Lovely.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.911
I'm really nervous
about my cooking.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.413
If a guy doesn't eat
every bite

16:53.446 --> 16:54.981
of my grandma's ravioli,

16:55.014 --> 16:56.483
I go nuts.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.386
Well,
we certainly...

16:59.419 --> 17:01.688
don't want that
to happen,

17:01.721 --> 17:02.822
do we?
[ Chuckles ]

17:02.855 --> 17:04.391
Now, uh...

17:04.424 --> 17:06.159
where are you from?

17:06.193 --> 17:07.227
[ Muffled ]
Originally.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.661
I would say Italy,

17:08.695 --> 17:10.163
but there's no accent,

17:10.197 --> 17:11.598
so, obviously,
that's not the case.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.067
Oh, Luke, Luke.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.169
Luke, any word on
my Monroe Doctrine paper?

17:16.203 --> 17:17.604
Oh, actually, I decided

17:17.637 --> 17:19.239
not to drop that class,

17:19.272 --> 17:20.840
so it didn't feel right
turning it in.
Huh.

17:20.873 --> 17:22.041
But something funny
did happen.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.243
I had your paper open
on my computer.

17:23.276 --> 17:25.044
Paige saw it
and thought it was mine.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.446
She made some
really good changes.

17:26.479 --> 17:28.248
Changes?
Yeah, well,

17:28.281 --> 17:29.682
she cut to the chase
in a few places,

17:29.716 --> 17:31.017
cleaned up the ending.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.219
She's a history major,
you know.

17:32.252 --> 17:34.387
Get it.
Mom, I'm...

17:34.421 --> 17:35.922
kind of in the middle
of a dinner date.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.424
Are you?
By now you might be

17:37.457 --> 17:38.725
in the middle of a movie
or a board game.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.393
We all know how obsessed
she is with changing things.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.461
Go get the paper,
Luke.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.898
Oh, good,
you're okay.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.367
I'm not that okay.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.402
I'm not a fan
of this Paige.

17:49.436 --> 17:51.271
She's got some nerve.
So you're aware.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.039
Oh, I'm aware. I'm aware
that she has no problem

17:53.072 --> 17:54.407
putting her grubby,
little paws all over

17:54.441 --> 17:55.708
something that doesn't
belong to her.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.877
I can see
you're upset.
I am.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.879
I'm upset because
I basically took

17:59.912 --> 18:01.881
the most boring thing
in history

18:01.914 --> 18:03.883
and made it interesting.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.952
She thinks she can just come in
here and just make it hers.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.420
No.
Feels a little hurtful,

18:07.454 --> 18:09.722
but she is my student,
and I have a lot at stake here,

18:09.756 --> 18:11.958
so can I please
just handle this myself?
[ Sighs ]

18:14.494 --> 18:16.929
You didn't miss much
with the ravioli.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.998
The showstopper
is my branzino.

18:19.031 --> 18:20.433
It smells great.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.468
We don't get to have
fish around here.

18:21.501 --> 18:22.569
My dad hates it.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.137
Well, this one's
a family recipe,

18:24.171 --> 18:25.438
so if you
don't like it,

18:25.472 --> 18:27.774
I'll pretty much
have to drop you.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.776
Well...

18:29.809 --> 18:30.843
let's not have

18:30.877 --> 18:32.612
any of that

18:32.645 --> 18:34.414
crazy...talk.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.416
Two minutes to deadline.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.318
I couldn't let her
drop my class!

18:40.387 --> 18:42.121
Now [clears throat]

18:42.155 --> 18:43.323
...back...
[breathing shakily]

18:45.392 --> 18:46.759
...[muffled]
to where you're from.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.094
Encino.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.529
Oh. [ Gags ]

18:49.562 --> 18:51.498
[ Quietly ]
Damn it.

18:51.531 --> 18:52.999
Mom, don't be mad at her.
She was just --

18:53.032 --> 18:54.634
No, she made it better.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.503
What was I thinking
with this sentence?

18:56.536 --> 18:59.138
"The esteemed barrister's
argument was as layered

18:59.172 --> 19:01.641
as the cuffs on
his after-dinner breeches"?

19:01.674 --> 19:04.043
That is the third time
I mentioned breeches.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.278
What was I
going through?

19:05.312 --> 19:07.514
Can I go now?
[ Sighing ] Yeah.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.182
Oh, wait, honey.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.451
I like
this girl for you.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.520
She deserves better
than boxed wine.

19:13.553 --> 19:14.921
Haley keeps a nice bottle
under her bed.

19:17.724 --> 19:20.827
You really seemed
to like that.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.162
Oh, yeah.
I could
make another one,

19:23.196 --> 19:24.664
but it would
take a while.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.065
Let's see.
It's 7:00 now --

19:26.098 --> 19:28.335
Oh, thank God.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.737
Paige, we have to talk.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.340
I-I may have sent some signals
I didn't mean to send.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.041
Nonetheless,
some of your behavior

19:35.074 --> 19:37.344
has been a little
inappropriate, frankly,

19:37.377 --> 19:39.178
kind of disrespectful
to my wife.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.547
Oh, wait, hang on.
Hang on.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.981
I changed my mind
about that.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.883
I am
not mad at you.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.485
All you did was take
an interest in something

19:45.518 --> 19:48.187
that I should have dropped
25 years ago.

19:48.221 --> 19:50.423
Um, Claire.
And can I say something else?

19:50.457 --> 19:52.425
I'm all in favor
of this relationship.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.193
Claire?
I don't want to jinx it,

19:54.227 --> 19:56.162
but I think
you could be

19:56.195 --> 19:57.830
exactly what he needs.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.433
I know, he may look
like a man,

20:00.467 --> 20:01.668
but, honestly,
in a lot of ways,

20:01.701 --> 20:02.769
he's still
just a little boy.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.505
Complete mess
in the bedroom.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.674
Although,
here's a tip for you.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.777
He actually does respond well
if you stay on top of him.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.280
So, you're okay with --
Absolutely.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.382
As a certain U.S. president
once said,

20:15.415 --> 20:17.950
"Let the era
of good feelings commence."

20:17.984 --> 20:20.253
Oh, my God!
This is the best day ever!

20:20.287 --> 20:21.521
Phil: Oh!

20:21.554 --> 20:22.889
Huh.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.557
Huh.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.193
So, it turns out Paige was
only making dinner for me

20:27.226 --> 20:28.895
so she could
get close to my dad.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.397
I am sorry, buddy,
but I did warn everyone

20:30.430 --> 20:31.564
about the Dunphy charm.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.232
It's also
a little interesting

20:33.266 --> 20:35.368
that Paige's Realtor dad
abandoned the family

20:35.402 --> 20:37.270
when she was 12.
Seems irrelevant.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.605
He also
dabbled in magic.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.040
Now we're just having
two separate conversations.

20:41.073 --> 20:43.109
Did you know her last
three boyfriends were 50?

20:43.142 --> 20:44.744
Maybe spend a little less time
with your nose

20:44.777 --> 20:46.746
in that psych book and a little
more time being sexy.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.250
Ah, ah, ah.
You'll get this back

20:51.284 --> 20:51.984
when your homework
is done.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.153
Joe,
what is this?

20:54.186 --> 20:55.722
Just some notes
from my friend Hannah.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.824
Friend? This doesn't sound
to me like that.

20:57.857 --> 20:58.925
This is
very flirty.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.760
Let me see that.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.463
"Dear, Joe, want to share
half my Fruit Roll-Up?"

21:03.496 --> 21:04.997
Well, this is just
kids being kids.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.499
Ay, don't be a fool.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.900
[ Sultry voice ]
"Dear Joe, wanna share

21:07.934 --> 21:09.936
half my Fruit Roll-Up?"

21:09.969 --> 21:11.404
That's a different
spin on it.

21:11.438 --> 21:12.339
Where's
that voice been?

21:12.372 --> 21:13.640
Try this one.

21:13.673 --> 21:16.008
"It was so fun
running at recess."

21:17.710 --> 21:20.313
"Randy's rash
is really gross."

21:20.347 --> 21:21.648
Maybe we should
go upstairs.

21:21.681 --> 21:22.982
Watch your movie, Joe.
