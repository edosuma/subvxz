00:04.520 --> 00:07.120
Please be aware, Mr Shelby,
that the deaths of your people

00:07.120 --> 00:09.160
are your own responsibility.

00:09.160 --> 00:11.120
Since my mother
passed away four years ago,

00:11.120 --> 00:12.520
Tommy and I haven't even spoken.

00:12.520 --> 00:15.200
I'm very much looking forward to
working with you again, Michael.

00:15.200 --> 00:18.200
That, my friend, is the finest opium
in the world.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.840
Why would you sell? The Irish
are being difficult.

00:20.840 --> 00:22.200
The Italians are not an option.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.360
You're going to America? To Canada,
to collect payment for the shipment.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.760
Elizabeth,
you are a very lucky woman,

00:27.760 --> 00:29.920
to have each day what
I have only sampled once.

00:29.920 --> 00:32.440
Mr Shelby,
your daughter has consumption.

00:32.440 --> 00:34.600
She's gone, Tommy. She's gone.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.840
A daughter lost. A son found.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.880
This is my son.
They call him Duke.

00:38.880 --> 00:42.640
It is tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

00:42.640 --> 00:44.560
How long? Perhaps 18 months.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.160
My associates are going
to take care of Thomas Shelby,

00:47.160 --> 00:49.080
and you are going
to give us his brother.

00:49.080 --> 00:51.680
What are Michael's real intentions
towards me, Gina?

00:51.680 --> 00:53.560
And if you lie, I will know.

00:53.560 --> 00:56.000
It is my intention
to kill Tommy Shelby.

00:57.160 --> 01:02.200
This programme contains
scenes of Repetitive Flashing Images

01:02.200 --> 01:07.400
and some scenes which some viewers
may find upsetting,

01:07.400 --> 01:13.040
and very strong language and some
violent scenes from the start.

01:22.120 --> 01:26.800
It was the ambitions and strategies
of one man that caused this.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.560
I will take revenge
on Tommy Shelby.

01:58.840 --> 02:02.640
Do you want a drink first
or a whore first?

02:04.080 --> 02:06.880
I want to see my wife first.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.560
After you've fucked your wife,

02:08.560 --> 02:11.080
you're going to kill a man,
right?

02:40.280 --> 02:41.760
DOOR OPENS

02:41.760 --> 02:43.320
SNIFFLING

02:56.560 --> 02:59.040
The smoke
from your daughter's funeral

02:59.040 --> 03:01.000
is still in your clothes...

03:02.360 --> 03:04.480
...and you slept with someone.

03:06.960 --> 03:09.920
Not just someone.

03:09.920 --> 03:11.400
The enemy.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.920
Every enemy we ever had
in one woman.

03:17.920 --> 03:21.320
There are some things
that I do, Lizzie, that I...

03:21.320 --> 03:24.160
You're not so good
at lying any more, Tommy.

03:24.160 --> 03:27.240
These days,
the truth gets in your eyes.

03:30.160 --> 03:32.360
I have to go to Canada, Lizzie.

03:33.720 --> 03:37.440
I need to know where you will go.
See? You just accept it.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.560
You don't fight it.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.560
You ARE cursed, Tommy.

03:46.920 --> 03:51.200
Never to understand the limits
that other people will accept.

03:53.760 --> 03:57.280
Never to be allowed in
where everybody else is.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.200
A curse never to be lifted.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.680
I will be away, Lizzie.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.720
And while I'm gone,
I know a place where...

04:10.720 --> 04:13.360
Always gone, always away.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.560
Well, now your rings are gone,

04:17.560 --> 04:19.840
your rings are away.

04:19.840 --> 04:21.800
I'm already packed.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.560
Now leave me to say goodbye
to Ruby.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.720
I have to go away for a bit,
Charlie.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.680
Look at me.

04:53.680 --> 04:55.600
Hey. Look at me.

05:00.240 --> 05:03.720
Mum already told me
she's leaving...

05:03.720 --> 05:06.000
..and she told me why.

05:15.800 --> 05:18.480
Mum, where are you going?

05:22.000 --> 05:23.680
A hotel.

05:23.680 --> 05:26.560
And then your father
will get me a house.

05:31.400 --> 05:34.880
Mum, I'll come with you.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.520
I'd rather be with you.

05:38.520 --> 05:39.760
Wherever it is.

05:41.280 --> 05:42.560
You're not my mum...

05:44.120 --> 05:46.680
..but you're more my mum
than he's my dad.

05:48.480 --> 05:50.200
He's never here.

05:52.120 --> 05:54.720
I'd be on my own here.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.440
Oh, Charles, love...

05:58.480 --> 06:01.360
..I don't think your father
would allow that.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.680
You can go.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.400
You can go, son.

06:09.880 --> 06:11.640
I know a good place.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.000
Lizzie,
I'll arrange that place.

06:14.000 --> 06:16.920
And, Charlie,
you can take him, eh?

06:18.320 --> 06:20.800
They have stables
at this new place.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.080
After a while, he'll...
He'll listen to you.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.520
He'll forget about Ruby.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.400
That's how horses are.

06:29.760 --> 06:32.600
And you'll be here all alone.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.120
I'm buying land, Lizzie.
I'm buying up land.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.960
This place I've bought

06:37.960 --> 06:41.680
I was going to knock down,
but you can go there. Dad...

06:44.600 --> 06:46.760
Where will you go?

06:52.520 --> 06:54.200
KEYS CLANK

06:54.200 --> 06:56.800
This is
the Peaky Blinders' armoury.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.400
We have
a very good relationship

06:59.400 --> 07:01.760
with the BSA factory
in Armoury Road.

07:03.720 --> 07:08.280
Two dozen machine guns,
half a dozen sub-machine guns,

07:08.280 --> 07:12.080
BSA sniper rifles,
three boxes of hand grenades.

07:12.080 --> 07:13.760
For what purpose?

07:15.440 --> 07:19.640
For eventualities like
the one that is about to occur.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.760
When men come to us
with bad intentions,

07:22.760 --> 07:24.720
the family come together.

07:24.720 --> 07:27.240
Tommy says it's time
you join the family.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.720
But you're not just going to be
a soldier.

07:31.720 --> 07:35.360
You're going to be a general...
some day.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.240
So, I need to ask you
some questions.

07:50.640 --> 07:52.760
What have you ever fired?

07:55.440 --> 07:56.920
Shotgun.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.840
Pistol.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.040
22.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.360
What have you ever killed?

08:06.360 --> 08:08.440
Few rabbits.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.480
Pheasant, partridge. A stag.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.920
Arthur tells me when they were
taking care of some business

08:15.920 --> 08:19.320
at the betting shop,
you ran away.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.440
It was unfair.

08:24.560 --> 08:27.720
Fairness is not
a soldier's concern.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.560
You do what you do.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.680
I already have done.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.560
Fair and square.

08:35.560 --> 08:37.920
I have killed a man.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.960
Tommy's always right.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.880
We were outside
a hospital in Bridgnorth.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.560
In the Black Country.

08:52.560 --> 08:54.600
My mother was dying.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.920
And the orderly
wouldn't give her a bed

08:58.920 --> 09:01.840
cos she was a Gypsy -
she had no insurance.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.200
She never saw the sunrise.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.080
Nor did that man
who denied her.

09:15.240 --> 09:18.240
Just one more thing
we need to know about you.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.360
Can you keep a secret?

09:29.560 --> 09:31.080
I know, brother.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.160
I know.

09:47.120 --> 09:48.880
I know.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.080
I stole your keys.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.080
Tuberculoma.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.720
In your brain.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.400
Yeah.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.080
But I still have time
to do what I need to do.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.480
Fuck you, Tommy.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.680
I don't need anyone to know,
Arthur.

10:17.040 --> 10:18.960
No, you don't, do you?

10:18.960 --> 10:21.040
You don't need anything,
do you?

10:21.040 --> 10:22.480
No, I don't need anything.

10:22.480 --> 10:24.600
I don't need anything.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.240
How long
have we been dead for, eh?

10:27.240 --> 10:29.200
You and me, how long?

10:29.200 --> 10:31.080
At least now
I'll have a certificate.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.560
ARTHUR SCOFFS

10:32.560 --> 10:33.960
Wherever it is,

10:33.960 --> 10:36.520
I'll get the drinks in
and I'll wait for you.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.200
Fuck's sake. Yeah.

10:43.280 --> 10:45.680
All them bullets that missed.

10:45.680 --> 10:48.160
TOMMY CHUCKLES
It's funny, Arthur.

10:48.160 --> 10:50.080
It's funny is what it is.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.400
So don't you fucking weep.

10:56.840 --> 10:58.320
Weep!

10:59.600 --> 11:02.440
When everyone is taken care
of financially,

11:02.440 --> 11:04.960
I will take myself away.
On my own.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.800
I don't want anyone...

11:12.960 --> 11:16.440
..anyone who may or may not
love me...

11:18.080 --> 11:20.560
..to have to see me crawl...

11:21.560 --> 11:23.560
..or grow insane and helpless.

11:23.560 --> 11:28.040
It would be a cruelty to me
and to them.

11:28.040 --> 11:33.720
By the time people know
the truth, I will be gone.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.920
What about Lizzie?

11:37.920 --> 11:40.200
I have some papers
I need you to sign

11:40.200 --> 11:42.080
on behalf of the company.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.960
Told Lizzie?

11:43.960 --> 11:46.920
I'm working
with the housing minister.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.920
I will be allocating contracts,

11:48.920 --> 11:51.400
construction contracts,
worth £10 million.

11:51.400 --> 11:53.240
You haven't told Lizzie?

11:53.240 --> 11:55.080
Some of the contracts
I will be allocating

11:55.080 --> 11:57.080
are with companies
in which we have an interest.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.600
Fuck you and your contracts!

11:59.600 --> 12:03.120
So the Shelby Company Limited
will continue to earn money.

12:04.200 --> 12:07.920
But mostly, Arthur, I'm doing it
because it's a good thing.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.200
Building houses. Oh...

12:10.200 --> 12:13.680
Yeah, for ordinary working people...
Oh, yeah, good for you. Fuckin'...

12:13.680 --> 12:16.560
..in the interests
of a fairer future.

12:16.560 --> 12:21.000
And before that,
I will be going to Canada

12:21.000 --> 12:23.800
to collect payment
for the shipment - £5 million!

12:23.800 --> 12:25.600
Oh, five fucking million?

12:25.600 --> 12:29.000
Which I will share
among the Shelby family.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.800
And that will be my legacy.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.520
Instead of me,
there will be money.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.360
Because for most
of the people

12:37.360 --> 12:39.600
who are close to me,
that is what I am!

12:39.600 --> 12:42.320
Fucking money.
That is my agency.

12:42.320 --> 12:45.640
Is that all you think you are,
eh? Hmm?

12:47.360 --> 12:49.120
Stand up.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.600
You heard me.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.680
Stand up.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.440
On your feet.

12:58.440 --> 13:00.720
On your fucking feet. Arthur...

13:00.720 --> 13:03.120
On your feet, Soldier.
On your feet.

13:03.120 --> 13:04.920
Stand the fuck up! Come here.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.240
No!

13:10.240 --> 13:11.520
No.

13:12.560 --> 13:14.040
You hear me?

13:14.040 --> 13:15.440
Enough.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.680
Enough!

13:26.120 --> 13:27.800
Now you know.

13:29.680 --> 13:31.240
You tell no-one else...

13:32.720 --> 13:34.120
..until I am gone.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.720
Until you're gone, yeah?

13:39.120 --> 13:42.040
When the time comes,
I'll call you.

13:45.280 --> 13:48.120
I'll tell you where.
It'll be a wagon.

13:48.120 --> 13:50.720
Fuck your wagon!

13:50.720 --> 13:52.560
You light the flame.

13:52.560 --> 13:55.760
You bring Charlie and Curly
and no-one else.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.720
Get drunk.

13:58.720 --> 14:00.680
Rake the ashes
for silver and gold.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.360
Fuck you!

14:03.560 --> 14:05.760
And your fucking plans!

14:20.360 --> 14:23.600
That time,
I did let you fucking win.

14:30.760 --> 14:31.800
John...

14:35.280 --> 14:37.280
Fuckin' you, John.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.040
Fuckin' both of you.

14:44.440 --> 14:45.840
Arthur...

14:47.200 --> 14:49.160
Arthur.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.520
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.800
ARTHUR SOBS
Come here.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.280
Come here.

14:56.560 --> 14:58.320
Come here.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.760
Let me see your eyes.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.520
I'm clean, man.

15:02.520 --> 15:05.200
The dragon's fucking gone.

15:05.200 --> 15:09.040
Thanks to you. Fucking...
Fucking thanks to you.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.640
You all right?

15:37.640 --> 15:38.960
Come on.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.280
Fucking...
Hey, I'm still fucking here.

15:43.280 --> 15:46.080
Pull yourself together,
come on. We have work to do.

15:47.800 --> 15:49.200
Come on!

16:03.480 --> 16:05.640
DOOR OPENS

16:12.360 --> 16:15.960
You're sure you want Billy?
I had to shut up the shop.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.640
Yes. We want Billy.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.400
Sit down, Billy.

16:25.320 --> 16:27.840
Thank you for inviting me,
Mr Shelby.

16:29.880 --> 16:32.160
Good to see you again, Billy.

16:38.400 --> 16:42.440
No. Mary says
not until after six o'clock.

16:47.920 --> 16:51.120
He said to tell his father
he feels OK about it.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.920
Good. Shut the door, Duke.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.560
Now, we are all gathered...

17:07.040 --> 17:08.080
...and those...

17:13.520 --> 17:17.880
Apologies, Mr Shelby,
I still don't speak the lingo.

17:17.880 --> 17:21.000
Well, Finn here never even
bothered to learn it.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.680
I heard "tachipen".

17:22.680 --> 17:26.000
Truth. You said something
about the truth.

17:26.000 --> 17:29.000
Truth. The truth is...

17:29.000 --> 17:31.440
..I called men here
that I could trust...

17:31.440 --> 17:33.560
..because I will be going away.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.240
I have to collect payment
for a shipment of goods

17:38.240 --> 17:42.120
which left Liverpool
ten days ago. Payment from who?

17:42.120 --> 17:44.600
South Boston Irish, Finn.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.400
Bootleggers.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.640
Are you going alone?

17:51.640 --> 17:54.520
Johnny Dogs has already sailed
for Canada.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.640
Michael will be there.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.280
Michael is family.

17:59.280 --> 18:01.960
Michael will be my guarantee
of safety.

18:01.960 --> 18:05.320
But while I'm away,
I have a job for you all.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.840
I need you to go
to Arrow House.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.960
I will be leaving Arrow House
for good,

18:09.960 --> 18:12.600
and there are things
that need removing.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.720
I need men that I can trust.

18:14.720 --> 18:17.200
There is cash,
there is valuables.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.600
There is information
about important people

18:19.600 --> 18:21.480
that has more value than gold.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.160
There are also bodies buried
in the grounds

18:26.160 --> 18:27.640
which need digging up

18:27.640 --> 18:29.880
before the contractors
start moving earth.

18:29.880 --> 18:31.880
Isiah, you will be in charge.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.400
In Arrow House,
there is a wine cellar.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.000
In that wine cellar,
there are fine French wines

18:38.000 --> 18:40.200
that are worth more
than a man's life.

18:40.200 --> 18:43.320
You are welcome to them, boys,
it'll be like a...

18:43.320 --> 18:45.320
..be like a farewell party.

18:46.520 --> 18:48.960
Are you ready for the party,
son?

18:53.120 --> 18:56.680
Tachipen.
The fucking truth again.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.160
What truth? You'll need shovels,
you'll need boxes,

19:01.160 --> 19:03.440
and you'll take the bones
to Mr Patches

19:03.440 --> 19:06.080
to put in the furnace
at Greenham's.

19:06.080 --> 19:08.120
Got it?

19:08.120 --> 19:09.960
Right. Any questions?

19:09.960 --> 19:12.520
Yeah. If it's a party,
can we bring girls?

19:12.520 --> 19:13.760
BILLY CHUCKLES

19:13.760 --> 19:16.800
No, Billy. All the fun will be
laid on for you.

19:19.040 --> 19:21.440
So, when is the party, Tom?

19:26.320 --> 19:28.000
Mr Shelby.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.920
Party's next Sunday, Billy.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.600
You mean this Sunday?

19:34.600 --> 19:36.440
Yeah.

19:36.440 --> 19:39.560
And while you're
digging fucking holes,

19:39.560 --> 19:42.520
I'll be here drinking
champagne with my wife.

19:42.520 --> 19:44.680
It's our wedding anniversary.

19:44.680 --> 19:45.920
Right.

19:45.920 --> 19:48.920
Oh, and, Finn, by the way,

19:48.920 --> 19:52.560
please explain to, erm,
what's her name?

19:52.560 --> 19:55.440
Mary. Mary? Yes. Is it Mary?

19:55.440 --> 19:59.120
Please explain to Mary
that you are a Shelby.

19:59.120 --> 20:01.360
It says it here
on the back of your watch.

20:01.360 --> 20:04.040
Have a look - Shelby. Look.

20:04.040 --> 20:07.240
This means you own the watch,

20:07.240 --> 20:09.080
the watch doesn't own you.

20:09.080 --> 20:12.160
The clock strikes six
when you fucking tell it to.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.760
Have a whiskey.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.200
Enjoy the party, boys.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.720
JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS

20:32.000 --> 20:34.880
SHE SIGHS
Want a drink, baby?

20:34.880 --> 20:36.240
No.

20:36.240 --> 20:38.480
Drinking water like Tommy, huh?

20:40.960 --> 20:44.080
Until this thing is done,
I need a clear head.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.920
PHONE RINGS

20:51.920 --> 20:53.320
Leave it.

21:08.280 --> 21:10.840
Yeah?

21:10.840 --> 21:12.040
Good.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.560
That's good.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.080
Look, I've got to go.

21:19.800 --> 21:22.480
Good news, Michael. Listen.

21:23.960 --> 21:27.720
That was our informant
in Birmingham.

21:27.720 --> 21:31.640
The Shelby men will all be together
on Sunday.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.960
But Arthur will be having
dinner with his wife

21:33.960 --> 21:35.880
at the bar
at the Garrison Tavern.

21:42.240 --> 21:45.840
As I recall, the Shelby table is
right next to the windows, correct?

21:45.840 --> 21:48.640
Every table's a Shelby table.
Yes, but...

21:49.880 --> 21:53.280
...maybe our people
could just drive by and...

21:53.280 --> 21:56.800
..shoot Arthur through the glass
without even getting out of the car.

21:58.720 --> 22:00.480
Michael...

22:01.520 --> 22:04.080
..we've talked about this -
there's no other choice.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.720
This business is between me
and Tommy.

22:06.720 --> 22:10.280
Yes, and when you kill Tommy,

22:10.280 --> 22:12.120
Arthur will come after you.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.880
He has to die too.

22:17.760 --> 22:20.400
If Arthur's in a bar,
he'll be drunk.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.280
Or worse.

22:23.280 --> 22:25.600
At least he'll die without pain.

22:32.600 --> 22:34.160
Who'll do the killing?

22:36.360 --> 22:39.040
Tommy's working
with a faction of the IRA.

22:39.040 --> 22:41.240
Connor has connections.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.600
They made a deal.

22:44.080 --> 22:47.280
A favour in return for guns.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.280
But, Michael...

22:52.160 --> 22:54.120
..whilst the assassin's
in this city...

22:55.640 --> 22:57.680
..Tommy has a son.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.240
He's a kid.

22:59.240 --> 23:00.640
Kids grow up.

23:02.240 --> 23:04.760
We don't kill women
and we don't kill kids.

23:06.240 --> 23:09.040
The informant also mentioned
a new boy named Duke.

23:09.040 --> 23:11.360
Do you want
a fucking bloodbath, Gina?

23:13.080 --> 23:15.160
I know about the new boy.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.440
I've decided that
the illegitimate son

23:17.440 --> 23:19.440
is not a threat. My decision.

23:22.160 --> 23:23.480
Only Arthur.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.840
Michael, baby...

23:28.320 --> 23:30.240
..everything's been agreed.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.160
Everybody wants the same things.

23:39.680 --> 23:44.400
How many men do you think they
killed with bullets and blades?

23:44.400 --> 23:46.760
That's how Tommy became king.

23:48.280 --> 23:50.760
And in three days' time,

23:50.760 --> 23:53.680
that's how you will become king.

23:55.600 --> 23:59.000
Deep down, Arthur and Tommy
want to be dead anyway.

24:00.720 --> 24:02.520
On Sunday, we'll just...

24:05.440 --> 24:08.200
..give them what they want.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.920
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

24:30.960 --> 24:33.760
DOOR OPENS

24:33.760 --> 24:36.760
Oswald was called away.
He sent me instead.

24:39.400 --> 24:41.200
Actually, that's not true.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.440
I sent Oswald away
and elected myself

24:43.440 --> 24:45.760
to be his representative.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.760
What was it you wanted?

24:49.560 --> 24:53.000
I'm planning on bringing
my housing bill before Parliament.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.040
You'll need to start drawing up
a list

24:55.040 --> 24:57.840
of all your land-owning families
with gambling debts,

24:57.840 --> 25:01.200
drug addictions, any other drain
on their resources.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.200
I will deliver offers to buy
the surplus land

25:04.200 --> 25:06.000
using Treasury bonds.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.760
Thomas, why don't we fuck here,

25:07.760 --> 25:09.200
on these benches?

25:10.400 --> 25:11.640
Right now.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.400
We wouldn't be the first.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.760
I hear your wife left you.

25:27.440 --> 25:31.880
Over the last few months, I've had
some associates of mine...

25:33.320 --> 25:35.560
..break into
some of your pals' houses.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.200
They stole paperwork.

25:37.200 --> 25:40.200
Letters, bills,
bank statements...

25:40.200 --> 25:42.240
Are you not upset?

25:45.120 --> 25:49.560
This is a list
of all land-owning families

25:49.560 --> 25:51.520
facing foreclosure.

25:55.360 --> 25:56.760
HE SIGHS

25:56.760 --> 25:58.360
And to answer your question...

26:01.760 --> 26:03.360
No.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.280
No, I'm not upset that
my wife left me.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.880
And, yeah,
if you want to fuck, I'll fuck.

26:12.880 --> 26:14.560
But you'll have to cross the floor

26:14.560 --> 26:17.040
cos I refuse to fuck
on Tory benches.

26:25.920 --> 26:27.360
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

26:32.200 --> 26:34.160
Mr Shelby.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.800
I was going to have
this delivered to you,

26:38.800 --> 26:41.400
but I decided to bring it
in person.

26:44.560 --> 26:48.400
It's an invitation
to mine and Diana's wedding.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.000
It's in Berlin.

26:51.080 --> 26:54.640
We're going to get married in
the presence of the Fuhrer himself.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.400
Were you having fun?

27:01.400 --> 27:03.760
Making paper aeroplanes.

27:05.560 --> 27:06.680
I'm afraid, er...

27:08.080 --> 27:10.720
..I have business.
I will be in Canada.

27:12.560 --> 27:14.080
Pity.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.200
Oh, and, er...

27:21.320 --> 27:24.920
..the other reason I wanted
to bring this in person

27:24.920 --> 27:27.040
was to tell you that,
after our wedding,

27:27.040 --> 27:29.400
you must understand, Mr Shelby,

27:29.400 --> 27:33.160
that if you so much as look
in my wife's direction,

27:33.160 --> 27:35.080
I will have you killed.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.360
Come, Diana.

27:43.120 --> 27:45.240
Just think...

27:45.240 --> 27:48.640
..very soon crumbling old
institutions like this one

27:48.640 --> 27:52.080
will be swept away and become
a thing of ancient memory.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.760
Fly safe.

28:17.280 --> 28:19.120
HE EXHALES

29:03.520 --> 29:06.560
Be careful with this baby.

29:06.560 --> 29:10.840
You see any potholes,
you drive round them.

29:29.280 --> 29:32.720
Mr Shelby called to say
to expect you.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.440
Yeah, we've come to do
a bit of gardening.

29:35.440 --> 29:38.920
We're hearing so many rumours about
what's happening to the house.

29:38.920 --> 29:42.120
Tommy says your second best
quality after your baking is

29:42.120 --> 29:43.720
you don't ask questions.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.840
Get everybody away from
the house until Monday.

29:51.800 --> 29:54.040
OK, let's find
these bottles of wine

29:54.040 --> 29:56.080
worth more than a man's life.

30:50.360 --> 30:52.000
There's only one guest here.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.600
The rest of the rooms are free

30:53.600 --> 30:55.680
if you want to use them
while you wait.

30:55.680 --> 30:58.760
Our friend will be here
by the time it gets dark.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.800
There was a storm last night.

31:00.800 --> 31:04.040
Last of a hurricane.
Boats all came in.

31:05.600 --> 31:08.360
He's not coming by boat,
he's coming by plane.

31:10.240 --> 31:12.200
Then your friend is dead.

31:12.200 --> 31:15.520
Wind was like...
HE WHISTLES

31:15.520 --> 31:17.720
Maybe God's done your job
for you, Mickey.

31:17.720 --> 31:19.560
My name is not fucking Mickey,

31:19.560 --> 31:22.120
there is no fucking God,
and Tommy will be here.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.760
Another one.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.200
THUNDER CRASHES

31:32.880 --> 31:34.720
RATTLING AND CREAKING

31:38.840 --> 31:41.080
There will be a war...

31:42.440 --> 31:44.240
..and one of you will die.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.600
Which one I cannot tell.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.480
You're a brave man, Mr Shelby.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.880
Where the fuck were you?

31:52.880 --> 31:55.440
She's gone Tommy. She's gone.

31:55.440 --> 31:58.560
The devils who did this will pay,
Ruby.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.600
Tuberculoma.
I am afraid it is inoperable.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.360
CRASH

32:03.360 --> 32:06.240
How long? Perhaps 18 months.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.680
I will change.
And change for good.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.880
What is this good
that you have become?

32:10.880 --> 32:14.080
Kill...and kill.

32:20.360 --> 32:22.240
CAR APPROACHES

32:40.600 --> 32:43.240
DRUNKEN LAUGHTER

32:47.280 --> 32:48.760
What's going on?

32:53.480 --> 32:54.720
What the fuck is this?

32:54.720 --> 32:56.840
I thought it was meant to be
a fucking party, lads.

32:56.840 --> 32:58.280
It is now you're here.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.120
Where's the...
Where's the fucking booze?

33:00.120 --> 33:04.160
In the kitchen. All the booze
is in the kitchen.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.320
All right.

33:17.320 --> 33:22.480
God gives a man wealth,
possessions and honour,

33:22.480 --> 33:25.040
but God steps in and says,

33:25.040 --> 33:28.240
"No, this is grievous,
mindless evil!"

33:28.240 --> 33:30.680
Where is he, Jeremiah?

33:30.680 --> 33:32.840
In heaven, looking down.

33:36.560 --> 33:40.880
God tells us that blood is given to
him from us.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.880
Why don't you turn
the fucking lights on, eh?

33:43.880 --> 33:45.880
Well, there's no longer
any power

33:45.880 --> 33:47.520
in the house of Thomas Shelby.

33:47.520 --> 33:51.280
Why not? What do you mean?
What happened?

33:51.280 --> 33:53.600
I thought there were
going to be girls here.

33:53.600 --> 33:56.240
Who need girls when you're in
a house bound for hell?

33:56.240 --> 33:57.600
Fuck d'ya mean?

33:59.520 --> 34:02.160
Hey. What the fuck do you mean?

34:06.600 --> 34:07.720
GUN COCKS

34:12.000 --> 34:13.640
Fuck!

34:13.640 --> 34:15.120
Fuck!

34:15.120 --> 34:17.680
We can do whatever we want
in this house.

34:17.680 --> 34:19.480
It's got a death sentence.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.120
HE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

34:23.120 --> 34:25.680
HE EXHALES
I don't want a drink.

34:25.680 --> 34:27.000
GLASS SMASHES

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
I want to go dig up
those fucking bodies, yeah?

34:29.000 --> 34:32.560
Billy? Yeah? Got to wait until
all the bodies are buried

34:32.560 --> 34:34.400
before you start digging them
back up.

34:34.400 --> 34:37.400
What the fuck does that mean?

34:38.840 --> 34:40.800
I'm a fucking Shelby.

34:42.440 --> 34:44.120
So am I.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.240
He's here.

35:49.640 --> 35:53.000
Step back and give me
a bit of light there, boys.

36:31.440 --> 36:34.640
HE BREATHES DEEPLY

36:51.400 --> 36:53.800
Charge is set to blow
in 30 minutes.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.880
That's at exactly 16.20.

36:55.880 --> 36:57.520
Everybody got that?

37:01.520 --> 37:03.080
I'll do it.

37:04.440 --> 37:06.400
This is between me and Tommy.

37:06.400 --> 37:09.160
I'll do it with my own hand.

37:09.160 --> 37:12.120
I'll come with you.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.280
Yeah, don't slam any doors.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.400
Easy.

37:40.840 --> 37:43.240
It's just a pity
you didn't have the guts

37:43.240 --> 37:44.840
to shoot him face to face.

37:46.040 --> 37:49.560
My mother was a Gypsy.
She saw the future.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.960
She always said
it won't be a bullet

37:51.960 --> 37:53.800
that'll kill Tommy Shelby.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.640
Hey, lads.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.440
Over by the bridge.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.760
Big, big fish.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.800
Poisson. Grande.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.280
Go on.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.120
HE GASPS

38:13.120 --> 38:14.880
Take the gun, Finn.

38:16.960 --> 38:19.240
Arthur says if you don't do it,

38:19.240 --> 38:21.600
then you can walk away
from this family for good.

38:21.600 --> 38:25.800
What the fuck do you know
about family? You're not family!

38:25.800 --> 38:29.160
You're the son
of a fucking whore!

38:32.080 --> 38:34.240
Just take the gun and do it,
Finn.

38:34.240 --> 38:36.600
Take the fucking gun.

38:45.280 --> 38:49.160
Now you have the gun, Finn,
you have the gun.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.120
Use it on these fucks!

38:58.320 --> 38:59.600
GUN CLICKS

39:01.840 --> 39:03.600
GUN CLICKS
Argh!

39:06.960 --> 39:09.080
Charlie Strong told me,

39:09.080 --> 39:10.680
"When you give Finn the gun,

39:10.680 --> 39:12.560
"make sure the first two chambers
are empty."

39:12.560 --> 39:14.200
HE CHUCKLES

39:14.200 --> 39:15.960
Good old Uncle Charlie.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.040
HE WHIMPERS

39:37.560 --> 39:40.480
You are no longer a member
of this Shelby family.

39:42.200 --> 39:47.040
By order of
the Peaky fucking Blinders.

39:47.040 --> 39:49.080
I will come for you.

39:49.080 --> 39:52.200
I will fucking come for you!

40:18.760 --> 40:21.640
JEREMIAH PREACHES IN THE DISTANCE

40:39.120 --> 40:41.920
..That find me faulting them

40:41.920 --> 40:45.560
who govern like dogs in
Garrison Lane.

40:45.560 --> 40:48.080
Hear this, then came
Jesus forth

40:48.080 --> 40:50.280
wearing the crown of thorns

40:50.280 --> 40:51.960
and the purple robe,

40:51.960 --> 40:55.640
and Pilate said,
"Behold the man,

40:55.640 --> 40:57.000
"he is the man."

40:57.000 --> 40:59.680
Not the Peaky Blinders!

40:59.680 --> 41:03.640
We see them in the automobiles,
with their whores and their...

41:03.640 --> 41:06.000
PREACHING CONTINUES

41:08.800 --> 41:10.200
WATCH TICKS

41:11.520 --> 41:13.000
Hmm.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.760
PHONE RINGS

41:26.720 --> 41:28.400
DOOR OPENS

41:29.640 --> 41:33.040
RINGING CONTINUES

42:18.760 --> 42:20.360
GUN COCKS

42:22.640 --> 42:26.200
Order your man to drop it.
Order him.

42:26.200 --> 42:28.720
Empty the fucking gun.
Tell him.

42:34.720 --> 42:36.640
You all right, Charlie?

42:36.640 --> 42:38.200
All good here, Arthur.

42:38.200 --> 42:40.320
Let's move.

42:40.320 --> 42:44.240
Take you out to the street
cos I don't want to spoil my pub.

42:55.160 --> 42:57.160
You'd shoot us like dogs?

42:57.160 --> 43:01.120
No. I don't shoot dogs.
I shoot fucking fascists. Move.

43:02.640 --> 43:04.880
GUNFIRE

44:54.520 --> 44:56.360
Fuck! Fuck!

45:04.160 --> 45:05.640
Fuck!

45:27.880 --> 45:29.480
LAURA WHISTLES

46:18.960 --> 46:20.480
Oh, Lord!

46:20.480 --> 46:25.400
Time for the chosen one
to reveal himself.

46:45.360 --> 46:47.360
BABY CRIES

46:57.520 --> 46:59.440
Let's go and see!

47:01.960 --> 47:05.880
Kids, no, come here.
I said, come here!

47:05.880 --> 47:08.360
What have I told you
about running off?

47:08.360 --> 47:11.560
Don't pick up things. Don't.

47:11.560 --> 47:12.880
Come here, come on.

47:19.560 --> 47:22.200
Emily! Emily, come on.

47:22.200 --> 47:25.400
If you get lost in the fog,
the Peaky Blinders will get you.

47:25.400 --> 47:28.120
BABY CRIES

47:28.120 --> 47:29.480
Jeremiah...

47:30.840 --> 47:34.800
..let's charm the old keepsake
from Passchendaele.

47:51.320 --> 47:52.600
Fuck!

47:54.840 --> 47:57.240
Fuck!
SHE COUGHS AND WHEEZES

48:35.080 --> 48:37.040
SHE COUGHS

48:48.240 --> 48:51.280
COUGHING CONTINUES

49:07.040 --> 49:09.040
Come here.

49:09.040 --> 49:11.800
Shh...

49:11.800 --> 49:13.560
SHE COUGHS

49:13.560 --> 49:16.400
Breathe.

49:22.840 --> 49:25.080
Her name was Elizabeth Gray.

49:28.080 --> 49:29.560
She was my Aunt Polly.

49:29.560 --> 49:31.280
SHE WHEEZES

49:31.280 --> 49:32.760
My Aunt Polly.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.680
Vengeance is for the Lord...

49:43.200 --> 49:45.680
Not in Small Heath, it ain't.

49:49.200 --> 49:51.120
Rest in peace, Pol.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.200
Leave us, Uncle Charlie.

50:26.200 --> 50:27.600
We're still in France.

51:09.840 --> 51:11.360
OK.

51:12.840 --> 51:15.200
I see him
coming out of the fog.

51:29.400 --> 51:30.880
DOOR OPENS

51:35.680 --> 51:37.960
How was the flight?

51:37.960 --> 51:41.160
They say it's the future,
I'm not so sure.

51:41.160 --> 51:42.640
Whiskey.

51:44.880 --> 51:47.040
Hello, Michael.

51:48.440 --> 51:50.080
Tommy.

51:58.880 --> 52:01.080
Give me another.

52:03.520 --> 52:07.800
We want you to take us to where the
opium is being stored.

52:07.800 --> 52:10.720
And then we will provide you
with a banker's draft

52:10.720 --> 52:12.920
for the full amount.

52:12.920 --> 52:14.560
$5 million.

52:16.520 --> 52:18.960
$5 million.

52:18.960 --> 52:20.440
Let's go.

52:27.720 --> 52:29.520
I'll go with Tommy.

52:29.520 --> 52:31.200
You boys follow behind.

52:36.880 --> 52:40.200
Ah, shit. Forgot my cigarettes.

54:34.240 --> 54:35.560
Mum...

54:38.640 --> 54:40.760
..it's done.

54:42.640 --> 54:44.200
It's over.

54:46.760 --> 54:49.120
And may God forgive me.

55:22.480 --> 55:26.280
Johnny! Johnny, where are you?

55:28.240 --> 55:31.280
I switched the ticker
like you said, Tom.

55:34.840 --> 55:37.760
Tell me I've done
a good thing here, Tom.

55:48.440 --> 55:50.320
Goodbye, Michael.

55:50.320 --> 55:51.760
Goodbye, Johnny.

55:53.800 --> 55:55.600
You're a good man.

55:58.920 --> 56:02.760
I'm going to go look at the fog,
Tom.

56:08.480 --> 56:10.200
Speak to me.

56:11.880 --> 56:13.760
Speak to me, Michael.

56:16.800 --> 56:20.360
You killed her. Polly made
her own choices, Michael.

56:20.360 --> 56:21.960
No...

56:21.960 --> 56:25.600
No-one close to you makes a choice
without your opinion, Tom.

56:27.640 --> 56:29.280
Not Arthur,

56:29.280 --> 56:32.280
not me, not Ada.

56:34.160 --> 56:36.880
We can't escape you.

56:39.000 --> 56:41.560
Your lethal hand is always
on our shoulders.

56:46.280 --> 56:47.800
Polly was half of me.

56:49.160 --> 56:51.120
Still visits me in my dreams.

56:53.240 --> 56:55.120
She'll visit me no more.

57:08.840 --> 57:11.280
I have no limitations.

58:16.000 --> 58:18.960
I smell the smell
of roasting Irishmen.

58:18.960 --> 58:21.080
Oh, yes, hello.

58:22.280 --> 58:24.800
HE PLAYS PIANO KEYS
I also smell the smell of tobacco,

58:24.800 --> 58:27.760
which is forbidden in my presence
for all except for one -

58:27.760 --> 58:29.320
my new wife, Edna.

58:30.760 --> 58:33.920
The Irish being rendered
to smoke and fat,

58:33.920 --> 58:36.600
I now own half of Boston,

58:36.600 --> 58:41.560
so, out of respect
for my restored authority...

58:43.240 --> 58:45.760
..put the fucking cigarette
out now, Tommy.

58:47.520 --> 58:49.400
Hello, Alfie.

58:49.400 --> 58:50.920
I heard it was a good wedding.

58:50.920 --> 58:53.120
Yeah, it was, actually.
Thank you.

58:53.120 --> 58:55.600
Edna's from a family circus.

58:55.600 --> 58:58.240
So, after the ketubah
and the old swapping of rings

58:58.240 --> 59:02.080
and the smashing of glass,
we left aboard elephants!

59:02.080 --> 59:03.840
Yeah, it was quite a thing.

59:03.840 --> 59:06.080
They had to shut down
Camden High Street,

59:06.080 --> 59:08.360
and even the Gentile what normally
fucking hate me,

59:08.360 --> 59:10.160
they waved with their hankies.

59:12.120 --> 59:13.440
Justice.

59:15.400 --> 59:19.040
And housekeeping. Long overdue.

59:19.040 --> 59:21.840
Yeah, look at
that little cunt ascending,

59:21.840 --> 59:24.320
he's ascending to the heavens!

59:24.320 --> 59:26.760
Right in front of us.
Before our very eyes.

59:26.760 --> 59:28.960
I can see with this eye.
I'm not blind.

59:28.960 --> 59:31.240
This eye is the eye
of a dead man.

59:31.240 --> 59:34.040
Dead men can see through life
like it was a curtain

59:34.040 --> 59:36.560
that billows with the flicker
of truth upon it.

59:36.560 --> 59:38.840
And I can see with this eye,
Tommy,

59:38.840 --> 59:43.080
that your nephew is ascending,
and he will be forgiven.

59:43.080 --> 59:44.720
Unlike you,

59:44.720 --> 59:46.960
who, on Judgment Day,

59:46.960 --> 59:50.920
is probably truly fucked when the
other shoe drops.

59:50.920 --> 59:52.360
Hmm?

59:56.000 --> 59:58.120
All right, Tommy?
How are you keeping?

1:00:00.200 --> 1:00:01.680
You know, Alfie...

1:00:03.120 --> 1:00:05.680
..so many people,

1:00:05.680 --> 1:00:07.840
so many times

1:00:07.840 --> 1:00:10.840
going to so much trouble
to kill me.

1:00:10.840 --> 1:00:12.440
I'm fucking dying anyway.

1:00:12.440 --> 1:00:14.360
We're all dying anyway.

1:00:14.360 --> 1:00:16.640
No.

1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:19.800
Not a bullet, not a bomb,

1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:21.800
not a knife.

1:00:21.800 --> 1:00:24.080
Is it clap? Is it clap?

1:00:24.080 --> 1:00:26.880
No, not even that noble.

1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:28.960
What are you trying to say?

1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:32.120
I'm about to sign over
half of fucking Camden Town

1:00:32.120 --> 1:00:33.560
to you as part of this deal.

1:00:33.560 --> 1:00:37.360
Are you saying you're
just going to die in your bed?

1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:40.280
I'm not going to die in bed, Alfie.
Who fucking dies in bed?

1:00:40.280 --> 1:00:43.080
Good people die in their bed,
Tommy. Good people.

1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:44.560
Good people, eh? Hmm.

1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:47.640
Good people.

1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:49.520
And yet here we are, Alfie,

1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:52.800
after all this time,
just you and me.

1:00:55.720 --> 1:00:57.760
And I crossed the line.

1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:02.320
Michael.

1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:05.520
Polly.

1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:09.520
Ruby.

1:01:11.600 --> 1:01:17.360
Tommy, if you are about
to express profound emotion,

1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:20.160
you might be better served
expressing it

1:01:20.160 --> 1:01:22.800
to someone
who gives a fuck,

1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:26.040
or perhaps to somebody
who is being paid

1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:28.000
to pretend to have to.

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:32.200
Like a fucking nurse.
Or a priest! Someone.

1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:36.760
And as for death,

1:01:36.760 --> 1:01:39.200
speaking as someone
who has been dead

1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:41.440
for a number of years,

1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:44.880
I can only
heartily recommend it.

1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:49.280
Well, Alfie,
your opera is complete.

1:01:55.960 --> 1:01:59.280
Shall we go
and witness the final act?

1:02:45.040 --> 1:02:47.400
Whenever you're ready, boys.

1:03:29.720 --> 1:03:31.120
That's enough.

1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:32.960
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:34.680
Thank you all for coming.

1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:38.120
Well, at least
I can say that, er...

1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:41.880
..I am one of those rare politicians

1:03:41.880 --> 1:03:43.880
who actually makes good
on his promises.

1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:47.480
Country estate -

1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:51.800
requisitioned to make way
for houses for working people.

1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:54.960
I improved my own home
with good intentions

1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:57.560
and 1,500lb of dynamite.

1:04:02.520 --> 1:04:04.040
Now I'm back where we began...

1:04:05.720 --> 1:04:07.400
..with horses and caravans...

1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:11.800
..vagabonds and thieves.

1:04:15.280 --> 1:04:17.400
Frances, sit down, please.

1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:29.920
I'd like to raise a toast.

1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:31.200
A simple toast.

1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:36.000
To family.

1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:37.720
To family. To family.

1:04:37.720 --> 1:04:41.960
Sometimes it is shelter
from the storm.

1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:46.280
Sometimes it is
the storm itself.

1:04:56.920 --> 1:04:59.320
I'm planning on going away
for a bit.

1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:02.080
After I'm gone...

1:05:05.440 --> 1:05:07.800
Ada...

1:05:07.800 --> 1:05:09.160
..in this family...

1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:12.880
..it was you who was born
to be a politician, not me.

1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:15.960
Remember that.

1:05:17.400 --> 1:05:19.960
And if ever a seat
is to become available

1:05:19.960 --> 1:05:22.400
in this ugly old city,
you should run.

1:05:22.400 --> 1:05:23.920
SHE LAUGHS

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:25.000
Where's Arthur?

1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:28.320
He went for a walk
down the river.

1:05:28.320 --> 1:05:30.600
He said he's not good
at farewells

1:05:30.600 --> 1:05:33.120
so he's decided to
go catch a trout instead.

1:05:36.560 --> 1:05:38.680
He told me to tell you that...

1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:43.560
"Where you're going, Tommy,
there will I be...

1:05:44.720 --> 1:05:47.360
"..very soon. Love, Arthur."

1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:57.520
How does Arthur know
where you're going, Tommy?

1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:01.760
You watch him, Linda.

1:06:01.760 --> 1:06:03.680
You love him.

1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:11.840
Charles, I want you
to look after your mum.

1:06:11.840 --> 1:06:15.040
You tell her I'm sorry,
you hear me?

1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:22.960
I want you to be the bes...

1:06:27.360 --> 1:06:30.760
Exactly how long
are you going away for, Tommy?

1:06:41.240 --> 1:06:42.840
Thanks, Curly.

1:06:47.960 --> 1:06:50.040
HE WHISPERS

1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:01.880
Tom, the horse.

1:07:01.880 --> 1:07:03.520
Shut up, Curly.

1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:13.200
Is she hitched, Johnny?

1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:17.320
Tommy, you tell me right now,
where are you going?

1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:20.240
You have to carry the bucket
on your own this time, Ada.

1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:22.120
Tommy, you come to me
with everything.

1:07:22.120 --> 1:07:25.520
You always come to me. Not this
time. Not this one, sister.

1:07:25.520 --> 1:07:28.640
What the fuck does that mean?
Where are you going?

1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:32.320
Tommy!

1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000
CROW CAWS

1:08:01.080 --> 1:08:03.040
CROW CAWS

1:08:06.760 --> 1:08:08.600
HE GROANS

1:08:56.240 --> 1:08:57.760
HORSE SNORTS

1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:11.080
GUN COCKS

1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:43.320
HORSE WHINNIES

1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:47.760
In the bleak midwinter...

1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:53.120
Dad... Dad, come out, come out!

1:11:54.360 --> 1:11:55.960
Dad, it's me.

1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:11.640
Did Polly send you?

1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:15.960
Did Polly send you?

1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:17.360
Or am I dead already?

1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:18.640
No.

1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:23.320
You're not dead.

1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:25.520
You're not even sick.

1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:27.000
But I am, my darling.

1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:30.360
I'm sick.

1:12:31.560 --> 1:12:33.000
Sick like you was.

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.200
No. Not true.

1:12:35.200 --> 1:12:38.000
I know it.
You've got to live, Daddy.

1:12:40.720 --> 1:12:42.800
You let the fire go out.

1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:47.520
Light the fire again
and get warm,

1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:50.680
and you will see
that you must live.

1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:55.680
You're not even sick, Daddy.

1:13:55.680 --> 1:13:57.720
HORSE WHINNIES

1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000
TOILET FLUSHES

1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:34.240
Fucking Gypsies.

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:44.680
Have you thrown the tinkers off
the top field yet?

1:14:44.680 --> 1:14:47.560
Well, I went up to the caravan,
sir, but there was no-one there.

1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:50.080
Well, go back up there
and set fire to the fucking thing.

1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:52.040
Yes, sir.

1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:00.600
Have you filled the car
with petrol?

1:15:07.680 --> 1:15:10.880
I said, have you filled the car up
with petrol?

1:15:14.320 --> 1:15:16.360
How was the wedding in Berlin?

1:15:18.880 --> 1:15:21.520
I hear Chancellor Hitler
himself was the best man.

1:15:24.040 --> 1:15:27.240
You've been my doctor now
for three years.

1:15:28.880 --> 1:15:31.400
Never knew you were
so well connected.

1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:33.840
Oh, and the doctor
at St Thomas's

1:15:33.840 --> 1:15:35.920
who you sent me to
for the second opinion,

1:15:35.920 --> 1:15:37.960
second set of X-rays?

1:15:37.960 --> 1:15:41.600
A maid of honour
at the same wedding.

1:15:41.600 --> 1:15:43.520
All so very well fucking
connected.

1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:47.400
On your knees, Holford.

1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:56.040
I'm guessing you people
all decided

1:15:56.040 --> 1:15:58.400
that the only person

1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:01.720
who could ever kill
Tommy Shelby

1:16:01.720 --> 1:16:03.640
is Tommy Shelby himself.

1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:09.160
You made me believe
death was coming.

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:11.680
Let my nature do the rest,
eh?

1:16:16.680 --> 1:16:20.280
You may not have tuberculoma,
Mr Shelby,

1:16:20.280 --> 1:16:21.920
but you are sick.

1:16:23.160 --> 1:16:24.640
I know you.

1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:27.880
You are sick with guilt.

1:16:29.640 --> 1:16:32.640
Sick of death at your own hand.

1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:35.880
Sick of who you were.

1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:40.520
You are no longer
the kind of man

1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:42.920
who would kill another man
in cold blood.

1:16:48.680 --> 1:16:52.960
Tommy, you have been
on a journey

1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:56.480
from the backstreets
to the corridors of power.

1:16:59.040 --> 1:17:00.640
You cannot go back.

1:17:02.040 --> 1:17:03.920
You are a different man.

1:17:05.480 --> 1:17:08.000
The gun no longer belongs
in your hand.

1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:16.200
Oh, but I am back.

1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:21.600
Back from under the ground.

1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:24.480
Close your eyes.

1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:29.480
Close your eyes.

1:17:31.960 --> 1:17:33.520
CLOCK BELL CHIMES

1:17:42.880 --> 1:17:44.880
WATCH TICKS

1:17:52.800 --> 1:17:54.520
The eleventh hour.

1:17:56.240 --> 1:17:58.000
Armistice.

1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:02.040
Peace at last.

1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:07.120
Peace at last.

1:18:09.880 --> 1:18:11.560
HOLFORD SCREAMS

1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:40.800
any riding done?

1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:03.280
any riding done?

1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:25.120
any riding done?

1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:43.960
any riding done?

1:19:58.120 --> 1:20:04.360
any riding done?

1:20:17.040 --> 1:20:22.400
any riding done?

1:20:36.080 --> 1:20:41.800
any riding done?
