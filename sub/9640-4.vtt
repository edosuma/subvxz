WEBVTT

00:06.692 --> 00:08.360
Is he looking at me?
Is he looking at me?

00:08.395 --> 00:10.198
- No. Walk by again.
- I can't.

00:10.232 --> 00:12.602
That'll be my fifth time.
He'll think I'm lost.

00:12.637 --> 00:15.109
How am I gonna
figure out if he likes me?

00:15.143 --> 00:16.812
Why is this
so hard for you?

00:16.846 --> 00:18.282
Because he knows
I like him,

00:18.450 --> 00:19.984
And I don't know
how he feels about me.

00:20.086 --> 00:21.820
I've never been
in this position before.

00:22.489 --> 00:25.159
That's why I play it cool around Justin.
I don't want him to know I like him.

00:25.193 --> 00:28.263
There he is! Hi, Justin I was wondering
if you wanted to come over today

00:28.298 --> 00:31.402
Because I rented three dvds and
they're not due till Monday...

00:31.437 --> 00:33.573
All right, I'll talk to you
later about it! Bye!

00:36.278 --> 00:39.680
Yeah, I can't play it
cool like you, Harper.

00:41.184 --> 00:43.118
Look, I'm just gonna
go up to him,

00:43.153 --> 00:44.686
Talk to him
and see if he likes me.

00:45.888 --> 00:47.756
- Hey, Dean!
- What's up, russo?

00:47.890 --> 00:50.292
Hey, Dean! We got the full
story on that sweet ride!

00:50.326 --> 00:52.596
- The one for the race at paramus!
- Sounds great.

00:53.064 --> 00:55.332
Joey's getting the story on this
car we might run. Tell it, joey.

00:55.366 --> 00:57.067
Yeah, tell it, joey.

00:57.269 --> 01:00.972
So, they had to rebuild. It was
completely greasy and... And...

01:01.006 --> 01:03.208
Car's not gonna be ready in time.

01:03.242 --> 01:05.810
Oh, bummer that stinks.

01:08.247 --> 01:10.548
And I'll bet they attached
thettlebrock heads

01:10.582 --> 01:13.014
And ordered a new
mylodon panatonic coat.

01:15.384 --> 01:18.720
We didn't want that car. It didn't
have rack-and-pinion steering.

01:18.754 --> 01:20.756
Yeah, 'cause steering
is important.

01:22.926 --> 01:25.929
Because without it
all roads...

01:25.963 --> 01:28.065
...Would have to be straight.

01:33.738 --> 01:36.774
"all roads would have to be
straight"? That went terrible.

01:36.808 --> 01:38.408
What's a "rack and pinion"
anyway?

01:38.642 --> 01:40.643
Well, a "rack" is what
you hang clothes on,

01:40.677 --> 01:43.479
And "'pinion" is what
you think of things.

01:43.513 --> 01:48.350
Like, "my 'pinion of that dress,
Harper, is that it's beautiful."

01:48.384 --> 01:50.085
Oh, why, thank you.

01:52.889 --> 01:55.458
Well, that sounds
kind of right, Harper,

01:55.492 --> 01:57.727
But I don't think they
were talking about clothes.

01:57.762 --> 02:00.397
Dean's always got
his posse with him.

02:00.432 --> 02:02.466
I need to get alone time
with him, you know?

02:02.501 --> 02:04.401
Aren't you afraid
of being alone with him?

02:04.536 --> 02:07.770
I hear he uses bar soap
for his body and his hair.

02:09.339 --> 02:12.141
No. That's the only way
I'll figure out if he likes me.

02:12.175 --> 02:14.009
Alone time is golden time.

02:14.044 --> 02:15.844
That's what my mom
always says to my dad

02:16.112 --> 02:18.447
Before they take their
separate vacations every summer.

02:20.382 --> 02:24.285
Um, ok, here he comes. I'm gonna try it again.
If I jack it up, just pull the fire alarm.

02:24.320 --> 02:28.022
I will not pull the fire alarm!
I'm a junior fire marshall.

02:28.057 --> 02:32.361
Hey! Um, my family owns
the waverly sub station,

02:32.395 --> 02:35.931
Which is really convenient if you want
a sandwich. You should come by sometime.

02:35.966 --> 02:38.801
You got salads there?
I likes my greens.

02:38.835 --> 02:40.635
He does.
He eats balanced.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.771
What...

02:43.805 --> 02:45.539
I wasn't panicking.
I was doing fine.

02:45.674 --> 02:47.375
It wasn't me.
This must be a real fire.

02:47.876 --> 02:51.045
All right! Nice and orderly, people!
Nice and orderly! Single file!

02:51.079 --> 02:54.182
I'm a junior fire marshall!

03:50.568 --> 03:52.969
Max, why do you
keep sending away

03:53.003 --> 03:55.138
For that stuff from the
back of the wizard weekly?

03:55.172 --> 03:56.973
It's always a rip-off.

03:57.007 --> 03:58.574
Justin, come on.

03:58.608 --> 04:02.744
There's no way an invisibility
poncho could be a rip off.

04:02.778 --> 04:05.746
Watch. All I need to do
is put this on,

04:05.781 --> 04:06.880
And I am invisible.

04:09.984 --> 04:12.018
Hey. You can't
see me, can you?

04:13.686 --> 04:15.420
I'm over here.

04:15.454 --> 04:17.788
Now, I'm over here.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.923
Now, I'm over here.

04:19.958 --> 04:23.560
Can't see me,
can you?

04:23.594 --> 04:26.262
Um, only your poncho
disappeared.

04:28.065 --> 04:30.299
Oh, man.
It's defective.

04:30.333 --> 04:33.100
Of course it's defective.
Dude, it's a rip-off.

04:33.135 --> 04:35.536
Those things never deliver
on what they promise.

04:35.837 --> 04:39.073
Instead of spending time on that, you
should be taking steps to improve yourself,

04:39.107 --> 04:40.241
Like I am.

04:40.275 --> 04:42.777
You got a job
as an ice cream man?

04:49.415 --> 04:51.682
Tennis racquet.

04:51.717 --> 04:55.619
It's gonna be hard to scoop
ice cream with that thing.

04:55.653 --> 04:58.221
I'm taking tennis lessons.

04:58.255 --> 05:02.358
I've decided that taking up a sport will
look good on my college applications.

05:02.392 --> 05:04.093
If you had a job
as an ice cream man,

05:04.127 --> 05:06.095
You wouldn't need
to go to college.

05:06.196 --> 05:09.765
Max, why don't you save
yourself some time and heartache

05:09.799 --> 05:13.702
And put your poncho package
up on your "shelf of shame."

05:13.737 --> 05:16.205
Ah, the amazing
3-d glasses.

05:16.239 --> 05:17.906
Let's put these things on,

05:17.941 --> 05:19.907
And take a look at
what else you fell for.

05:19.942 --> 05:21.475
Shall we?

05:24.078 --> 05:26.345
Ah, the amazing transport stick.

05:26.380 --> 05:27.880
I remember this one.

05:27.914 --> 05:29.815
It'll take you anywhere
you want to go,

05:29.850 --> 05:34.018
As long as it's
only 36 inches away.

05:34.052 --> 05:36.420
This one's not a rip-off.

05:36.454 --> 05:38.389
Transport!

05:42.360 --> 05:43.727
Oh, yeah.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.329
Now I remember what
the defect was.

05:48.799 --> 05:51.900
Anybody around it when I say
"transport" gets knocked out.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.769
You're right, Justin.
These things are a rip-off.

05:56.071 --> 05:58.471
Mind-reading kit!
I'm so getting this!

06:11.618 --> 06:14.720
Wow! Thank you, Harper,

06:14.755 --> 06:18.523
For going through all that trouble to make a
themed outfit for when I hang out with Dean,

06:18.558 --> 06:20.191
But you're not
a part of that, right?

06:20.226 --> 06:21.826
This isn't for you and Dean.

06:21.860 --> 06:24.161
This is for my first day
of driver's education.

06:24.195 --> 06:26.763
It can't hurt to put
your best foot forward.

06:31.368 --> 06:33.602
That's ok, mrs. Russo.
You have the right of way.

06:33.636 --> 06:35.503
Cars always yield
to pedestrians.

06:38.841 --> 06:41.176
Um, honey, listen,
I found this great charity

06:41.277 --> 06:44.179
Where you donate your used car and
they give it to someone who needs it.

06:44.213 --> 06:47.548
Great. I love charities, but
we don't have a car to donate.

06:47.582 --> 06:50.317
Uh, yeah we do. The piece
of junk in the garage,

06:50.351 --> 06:52.886
That makes us call
our laundry room the garage.

06:53.120 --> 06:56.425
And I suppose just because there's a
treadmill with your stockings hanging on it,

06:56.459 --> 06:57.659
It's a home gym, too.

07:05.433 --> 07:08.268
Oh, my gosh. He's here. What
do I do? What do I bring him?

07:08.303 --> 07:11.104
- He likes salad.
- Right. Ok.

07:15.041 --> 07:18.009
- Alex, that's not a salad.
- Oh. Right.

07:19.878 --> 07:21.046
Good.

07:23.983 --> 07:26.550
How am I going to talk to him
and find out if he likes me now?

07:26.584 --> 07:28.652
I'm gonna tell him
I need to talk to him alone.

07:28.987 --> 07:31.856
Whoa, you never tell a guy
you want to talk to him alone.

07:31.890 --> 07:34.091
You know what that sounds
like? He's in trouble.

07:34.493 --> 07:37.660
Or that a girl wants to talk about
her feelings, which is also trouble.

07:37.695 --> 07:39.695
Why would I ever
listen to you two?

07:39.863 --> 07:42.029
- Don't you want a guy's point of view?
- Yeah, sure.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.095
Why don't you nurses
find one and send him over?

07:45.463 --> 07:47.397
Five-point-four percent
of nurses are men.

07:47.431 --> 07:49.098
- It's a noble profession.
- Yeah.

07:49.233 --> 07:50.933
You know what else
is a noble profession?

07:51.334 --> 07:53.701
Continuing to speak to Alex
like she's on a tenth grade level

07:53.736 --> 07:56.904
When we know she can't
comprehend most words.

07:56.939 --> 07:59.473
- Ooh-hoo-hoo! -
"comprehend" means understand.

07:59.507 --> 08:01.708
- S-s-s-s.
- Total burn.

08:01.876 --> 08:05.343
And I would have treated that burn, if
you hadn't talked smack about nurses.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.016
Ok, look, Alex, if you
wanna talk to a guy,

08:12.050 --> 08:14.285
You gotta find an object
of common interest.

08:14.553 --> 08:17.587
For example, Dean's into cars and
roaming the halls without a pass.

08:17.621 --> 08:20.722
Nah-uh! He does have a pass.
I make them for him.

08:21.991 --> 08:23.858
Oh! Why don't you talk
to him about that car

08:23.959 --> 08:25.560
Mom and dad are always
fighting about?

08:25.794 --> 08:28.261
Dean's into cars,
you got a car... Huh?

08:28.296 --> 08:30.629
Here's your object of
common interest. Take it.

08:31.831 --> 08:33.998
I think I get it, Justin.

08:34.032 --> 08:36.166
For example, you're into
action figures.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.567
I was going through my dad's
stuff that we have to sell

08:38.702 --> 08:41.202
And I found something I'm not
sure we should keep or throw out.

08:41.236 --> 08:45.574
- It might be an action figure.
- Action figures, huh?

08:45.608 --> 08:48.277
Yeah, it's like an old boat
captain or something.

08:48.311 --> 08:52.014
With a hook for a hand and a
glass eye that's also a telescope?!

08:52.048 --> 08:53.414
Yeah. How did you know?

08:53.816 --> 08:57.117
Because that's a first edition
captain jim bob sherwood!

08:57.152 --> 09:00.487
Well, you can come over and look
at it right after we have dinner.

09:00.521 --> 09:02.088
You got it!

09:03.323 --> 09:05.190
Wow, his advice
really worked!

09:05.225 --> 09:07.792
I think we have a date.
You should listen to him more.

09:07.827 --> 09:11.162
I should listen to a lot of people
more. But what are you gonna do?

09:14.066 --> 09:15.299
Hey, salad.

09:15.334 --> 09:17.168
Just like my mama makes.

09:20.272 --> 09:21.838
Thanks, russo.

09:21.873 --> 09:24.641
So, uh,
what's going on?

09:24.675 --> 09:27.242
The guys are upset about not
having a car to race at paramus,

09:27.277 --> 09:29.311
So I thought I'd cheer
'em up with some nachos.

09:29.346 --> 09:31.013
Oh, we don't
serve nachos.

09:31.047 --> 09:32.548
But, how about
I melt some cheese

09:32.816 --> 09:34.282
On some stale bread?
Would that work?

09:35.284 --> 09:37.285
Sure. Just like my mama makes.

09:39.088 --> 09:40.955
Yes...

09:40.990 --> 09:43.857
Like your mom really
makes it like that...

09:46.393 --> 09:48.794
Oh, I'm laughing too long.

09:48.829 --> 09:50.396
Awkward.

09:52.865 --> 09:55.333
My dad has an old car
that doesn't work.

09:55.601 --> 09:58.770
It's in the garage. You can work on it
and fix it and maybe enter it in the race.

09:58.804 --> 10:01.973
Really? The race at the
paramus fair is in a week.

10:02.007 --> 10:03.173
Ooh, I love the fair!

10:03.341 --> 10:04.841
I hear in the infield
this year,

10:05.476 --> 10:09.244
They're gonna break the record by
making the world's biggest sloppy joe.

10:09.279 --> 10:12.513
So, uh, when should we come by
to check out the car?

10:12.547 --> 10:15.181
Now. You should come alone
because the garage is cramped

10:15.216 --> 10:16.883
Only room for
a couple people.

10:17.018 --> 10:20.653
Ok. Guys, I'm working
on the car by myself.

10:23.523 --> 10:26.692
Daddy, you know that car momma
says is junk but I love?

10:26.726 --> 10:27.926
You love my car?

10:28.061 --> 10:29.861
Oh, yes. Keep up with me here.
Love it.

10:30.096 --> 10:32.497
Ok. And you're going to love
that I got somebody from school

10:32.531 --> 10:34.465
To come over
and fix it for free!

10:34.499 --> 10:36.232
I do like free things.

10:43.571 --> 10:46.973
So this is the mind reading
kit you sent away for?

10:47.008 --> 10:49.008
It looks like
a toilet paper tube

10:49.042 --> 10:51.242
With glitter and macaroni
shells glued to it.

10:52.845 --> 10:55.679
It was a kit.
I followed the instructions.

10:57.916 --> 10:58.982
Ok.

11:00.017 --> 11:01.617
Now think something!

11:01.652 --> 11:04.018
Thinking.

11:05.788 --> 11:07.521
Think harder!

11:07.556 --> 11:10.490
Don't think you need one of those
to figure out what I'm thinking.

11:12.659 --> 11:15.494
<i>You got ripped
off again, dude.</i>

11:15.528 --> 11:17.696
- It works!
- It works?

11:17.730 --> 11:20.329
If you gotta stand that close
to hear someone's thoughts,

11:20.897 --> 11:24.699
The only thing you're gonna hear is, "why is
this freak holding a macaroni tube to my head?"

11:26.301 --> 11:30.202
So easy to criticize when you didn't
spend hours with a hot glue gun.

11:30.237 --> 11:34.072
It took you hours
to make this stupid thing?

11:34.107 --> 11:37.643
No, it took me a few minutes
to make this thing.

11:37.677 --> 11:41.413
It took me a few hours to get
my hand unglued from my face.

11:45.719 --> 11:47.420
Transport!

11:51.158 --> 11:54.026
That's what you get
for making fun of my stuff.

11:59.600 --> 12:00.834
Can you hold it closer?

12:00.968 --> 12:03.236
Uh, the answer
to that is yes.

12:03.270 --> 12:07.240
- Since you asked me something, I'd like to ask you something.
- Sure. Anything.

12:07.274 --> 12:13.144
Ok, well, there's a lot of
ways I could go here. So...

12:13.178 --> 12:16.547
How do you feel
about me...

12:16.582 --> 12:19.717
...In flip-flops? I'm thinking
about going casual all summer.

12:20.986 --> 12:22.453
Uh, well...

12:22.554 --> 12:25.488
That's, uh, not a shoe that
provides very much protection.

12:25.522 --> 12:29.892
- I'd vote against it.
- Yeah, totally. That's what I was thinking.

12:29.926 --> 12:32.929
Look, I'm just gonna come out and
ask you what I really want to ask you.

12:32.963 --> 12:36.498
No, no, no, no. It's my turn.
I wanna tell you something.

12:36.532 --> 12:39.200
Oh, you want to tell me
something? That's great.

12:39.235 --> 12:41.702
'cause now would be the time
to do it. No one's around.

12:41.737 --> 12:44.605
Ok, uh...

12:44.639 --> 12:48.941
Well, I've been, uh, having
this feeling that, uh...

12:56.449 --> 12:59.183
Hey, I just came down
to use the home gym.

13:05.456 --> 13:07.757
There, that should
dry nicely.

13:08.792 --> 13:10.659
So, how's my baby doing?

13:10.694 --> 13:13.228
- Daddy, I'm fine.
- Oh. Wh... Well, you are my baby.

13:13.262 --> 13:15.863
But, I was talking
about my baby.

13:17.065 --> 13:18.532
Ok, we're both fine.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.202
Hey, if the man's giving me
his car to race at paramus,

13:21.336 --> 13:24.238
- He gets to see what I'm doing to it.
- We're racing it at the fair?

13:24.272 --> 13:27.674
They're making the world's
biggest sloppy joe this year!

13:27.709 --> 13:29.876
I love food that's
bigger than it should be!

13:31.212 --> 13:33.647
All this talk about sloppy joes
is making you hungry.

13:33.681 --> 13:35.315
You should have mom
go make you one.

13:35.616 --> 13:37.616
- What's going on?
- I'm adjusting your air intake,

13:37.651 --> 13:39.284
So your fuel
will be more rich.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.154
You should try doing that
to the cash register upstairs.

13:46.091 --> 13:47.391
Oh! Watch the pipe.

13:49.494 --> 13:52.195
Guys! Guess what? We tried
out for the tennis team,

13:52.229 --> 13:53.996
And the coach told us
to get in shape.

13:54.164 --> 13:56.866
- Really?
- For the cross country team.

13:58.101 --> 13:59.734
We didn't make
the tennis team.

13:59.969 --> 14:02.002
Apparently, our headbands
were a little too tight.

14:02.036 --> 14:03.637
We got light-headed
really fast.

14:05.841 --> 14:08.275
Great story. Go tell
everybody in the sub station?

14:08.309 --> 14:10.611
Already told 'em.
They said to come down here.

14:11.145 --> 14:12.946
All right, Alex,

14:12.980 --> 14:17.950
Who shoved a super-duper bouncy
ball in my mind-reading tube?

14:17.984 --> 14:19.551
Well, I don't know.

14:19.886 --> 14:22.587
Who's the only person in this
family who has a super bouncy ball?

14:22.622 --> 14:24.555
Me, but then I lost it.

14:26.091 --> 14:29.058
If anyone sees it,
it looks just like this one.

14:29.092 --> 14:32.494
Ok! Everybody fan out and help
Max find his super bouncy ball.

14:32.529 --> 14:35.130
I think I saw it. Come
on, upstairs. Not here.

14:39.501 --> 14:44.205
Yay! It's momma, coming down
here to get you all out of here.

14:46.742 --> 14:48.976
That's a miracle.

14:49.010 --> 14:51.545
Dean, my man!
That's fantastic!

14:51.579 --> 14:53.280
Come on, let's take
it for a test drive!

14:53.314 --> 14:54.747
Yes!

14:54.782 --> 14:56.516
- Whoo!
- Bucket seats!

14:56.550 --> 14:58.784
Okay. Fine.
Let's all take a family ride

14:58.818 --> 15:00.352
In the new car.

15:00.386 --> 15:01.920
Ok.

15:03.155 --> 15:06.390
All right.

15:06.425 --> 15:09.993
Oh, uh, honey, can you open the
garage door, so we can get out of here?

15:11.896 --> 15:14.797
You wanted to
be alone, right?

15:22.614 --> 15:24.348
Well, it's not like
they ditched you, Alex.

15:24.483 --> 15:26.083
You did get to ride
in the car with Dean.

15:26.118 --> 15:27.785
Yeah, on my mom's lap

15:27.919 --> 15:30.420
With Justin and zeke signaling
truckers to blow their horn.

15:30.455 --> 15:32.922
Honk! Dork! Dork!

15:34.025 --> 15:35.492
Not how I pictured it!

15:35.760 --> 15:38.194
So, I'm sorry you didn't
get to find out if he likes you.

15:38.228 --> 15:41.062
Maybe it wouldn't even matter
if I was alone with Dean.

15:41.096 --> 15:44.498
Maybe he's the kind of guy who just
doesn't tell people if he likes them.

15:44.532 --> 15:49.068
Oh, man. Dean and I are having
the best time fixing up that car.

15:49.103 --> 15:51.937
You know what
he told me?

15:51.971 --> 15:53.271
He likes me.

15:56.508 --> 15:57.909
It made my day.

15:57.943 --> 15:59.643
I'm giddy for you, dad.

15:59.677 --> 16:02.012
But, did he happen
to mention anything about me?

16:02.046 --> 16:03.713
Why would he do that?

16:06.916 --> 16:10.484
This is so frustrating. I've tried
everything. What am I gonna do now?

16:10.519 --> 16:12.953
Yeah, too bad you
can't read his mind.

16:14.822 --> 16:18.124
Yeah... Too bad.

16:18.159 --> 16:22.194
See, right there. If I knew how to read
minds, I would know exactly what you meant

16:22.229 --> 16:26.130
By the way you said,
"yeah. Too bad."

16:43.778 --> 16:48.315
<i>I can't believe I didn't
make the cross country team.</i>

16:48.349 --> 16:51.084
<i>Everybody makes
the cross country team.</i>

16:51.118 --> 16:55.788
<i>I mean, I know I threw up.
But I kept running.</i>

16:55.822 --> 16:58.723
<i>I'll tell my family
I made the cross country team</i>

16:58.758 --> 17:02.660
<i>And then I'll sand down the soles
of my shoes to make it look real.</i>

17:05.597 --> 17:09.299
Oh, hey, Alex.
Guess what?

17:09.334 --> 17:10.767
I made the cross country team.

17:10.801 --> 17:12.469
It works. You're a liar.

17:14.003 --> 17:16.339
All right, what else
might come in handy?

17:16.373 --> 17:19.809
- Oh. "transport stick?" I wonder how it works.
- No, no, no! Alex,

17:19.843 --> 17:22.676
- Whatever you do, don't! Don't oh!
- Oh. Transport!

17:26.714 --> 17:29.816
<i>Lap five, race fans! The
racers have begun lap five!</i>

17:29.851 --> 17:32.685
Honk it! Honk your horn! Honk it!

17:32.720 --> 17:36.055
Would you two sit down?
There's no honking in racing.

17:36.090 --> 17:38.558
Hey, there's Dean in my car!

17:38.592 --> 17:41.194
Hey, he honked at me!

17:41.228 --> 17:45.264
I gotta go. I figured out a place where I
can get Dean alone and see if he likes me,

17:45.298 --> 17:47.533
During a pit stop. No one
can interrupt us there.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.768
That's not going to work.
His posse is his pit crew.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.370
- They'll be all over him.
- They'll be all over his car.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.371
- It's the only time they won't focus on him.
- I'll come with you.

17:55.506 --> 17:58.874
Really? Is this, like, whole "me and
Dean alone" thing just, like, lost on you?

17:58.908 --> 18:00.575
Not anymore. I'll stay here.

18:12.452 --> 18:14.586
Russo, how'd you get in here?

18:14.854 --> 18:18.422
You can get in anywhere with a jumpsuit and
a yardstick. I want to talk to Dean, alone.

18:18.457 --> 18:21.525
A bean burrito and a side of
hash browns. How 'bout you?

18:21.559 --> 18:23.794
What? No!
That's not what I said.

18:34.303 --> 18:35.836
Russo. What're you
doing down here?

18:35.871 --> 18:37.337
Look Dean, I was
trying to find

18:37.472 --> 18:39.038
A quiet place
so we could talk.

18:41.341 --> 18:44.342
You know that I like you and that's why
I've been acting kind of weird lately.

18:44.376 --> 18:47.645
And not my amazingly charming
and cool-without-trying self.

18:47.679 --> 18:50.681
- You're good to go! Go! Go!
- What? No, stay! Stay!

18:50.715 --> 18:52.283
Sorry, russo.
Got a race to win.

18:54.986 --> 18:56.319
Transport!

19:01.654 --> 19:03.687
Shoot! Didn't think
this through.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.488
Oh, he's looks so cute
when he's sleeping.

19:11.357 --> 19:14.794
Sorry, Dean. Transport!

19:17.231 --> 19:20.467
Oh, no. The giant sloppy joe
is full of ants.

19:20.501 --> 19:23.935
Oh, wait.
Those are people.

19:23.969 --> 19:26.136
This is gonna be great!

19:27.038 --> 19:28.238
Oh, man!

19:28.272 --> 19:30.172
Dean, are you ok?

19:32.508 --> 19:34.275
<i>I have to find
joey a girlfriend.</i>

19:34.409 --> 19:36.844
Ok, that's what
you're thinking about?

19:39.882 --> 19:43.484
What is Dean up to?
He's scratching up my baby!

19:44.920 --> 19:47.554
Wow. That looks bad enough
to ruin the car.

19:47.589 --> 19:49.656
We'll never be able
to take it home.

19:53.194 --> 19:56.294
This will never work.
The macaroni's falling off.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.663
Ok, it's time to go
old school on this.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.165
- Dean, we need to talk.
- What?

20:01.199 --> 20:03.367
Russo! What are you
going in here?

20:03.401 --> 20:05.970
Watch it!

20:06.004 --> 20:08.872
Brake, brake!
Now punch the throttle!

20:08.907 --> 20:13.909
- Not bad.
- Dean, look. I like you, a lot.

20:15.645 --> 20:16.778
Draft him. Draft him.

20:19.515 --> 20:24.819
- Do you like me, or not?
- Whoa. Yeah, yeah, I do.

20:24.853 --> 20:26.654
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:26.889 --> 20:29.690
- Why do you think I told the guys they couldn't help?
- Why?

20:29.725 --> 20:31.458
Because, I wanted
to be alone,

20:32.027 --> 20:34.627
But then your family kept piling in.
I'm trying to make a good impression.

20:34.662 --> 20:36.229
I'm not going
to tell them to leave.

20:36.263 --> 20:38.130
My uncle raised me with manners.

20:39.866 --> 20:41.633
You wanted to make
a good impression?

20:41.667 --> 20:44.836
Yeah, but I wasn't sure
how far to go.

20:44.870 --> 20:46.771
That's so sweet.

20:50.108 --> 20:52.275
Dean, sorry, maybe you
should take the wheel.

20:52.310 --> 20:53.710
Yeah.

20:54.845 --> 20:58.447
- We make a good team.
- Yeah, we do.

20:58.481 --> 21:00.415
I'm not talking
about the driving.

21:00.450 --> 21:02.150
Good, 'cause neither was I.

21:03.386 --> 21:05.120
Sloppy Joe!

21:11.458 --> 21:14.160
This is so romantic!

21:19.685 --> 21:22.753
Hey. What are you
doing out here?

21:22.787 --> 21:25.955
Oh, well, I just found out
the boy I like likes me.

21:25.989 --> 21:27.656
So, like all
those sappy movies

21:28.291 --> 21:30.659
I thought I should come out here to
the terrace and stare at the stars.

21:30.694 --> 21:32.695
But I gotta tell you,
it's really boring.

21:33.863 --> 21:36.430
So, I guess you and Dean
are an item then?

21:36.464 --> 21:38.732
I gotta say, I'm kinda sorry about that.

21:38.766 --> 21:40.800
Since when do you care?

21:40.835 --> 21:42.802
I'd always thought
when you got a boyfriend

21:43.204 --> 21:45.539
I'd be able to intimidate him if
he gets out of line or something,

21:45.573 --> 21:48.209
But I don't think
I could do that with Dean.

21:48.243 --> 21:51.314
He ripped the sleeves
off of his winter coat.

21:52.350 --> 21:54.186
Aw, don't worry about it.

21:54.655 --> 21:57.857
If he gets out of line, I'll be slapping
him silly with those winter coat sleeves.

21:57.891 --> 22:00.025
Good one.

22:00.060 --> 22:02.160
- I wish I would have
thought of that. - Yeah.

22:02.195 --> 22:03.895
So, what are you
doing out here?

22:03.929 --> 22:05.430
Hiding from dad.

22:05.464 --> 22:07.331
He thinks I'm at
cross country practice.

22:08.300 --> 22:11.367
Well, let me help you with that.

22:11.402 --> 22:14.504
- Oh!
- There. Now you're all sweaty.

22:16.838 --> 22:18.273
You wouldn't.

22:19.442 --> 22:21.042
Transport.

22:22.378 --> 22:24.311
Thank you very much.
