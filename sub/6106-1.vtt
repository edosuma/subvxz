Well, I had kind of
a weird childhood.

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:48.724
I grew up on a
survivalist compound.

01:02:50.225 --> 01:02:52.193
I haven't even told
Crispian that yet.

01:02:53.144 --> 01:02:54.646
Good answer.

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:02.492
Well, I guess when I was born,
my dad got kind of paranoid.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:04.489
He was convinced that the world

01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:07.702
was gonna run out of resources
in a matter of years.

01:03:09.828 --> 01:03:14.049
Found a lot of guys who agreed with
him, and we all moved to the Outback.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:18.045
Basically, if things got too
overpopulated, even out there,

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:20.972
he wanted me to be able
to take care of myself.

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:25.553
Moved to the States
with Mom when I was 15

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.513
but I learned a lot beforehand.

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:33.898

where Crispian is?

No, he... He ran out
right after Kelly did.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.382

I gotta go look for them.

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:05.892
