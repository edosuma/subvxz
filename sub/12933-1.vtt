02:05.834 --> 02:07.334
After twenty days of continuous bombing,

02:07.584 --> 02:10.001
Nanking finally fell to the Japanese.

02:10.501 --> 02:13.043
It was December the 13th, 1937.

02:13.584 --> 02:14.376
I remember

02:14.584 --> 02:16.084
everyone was running that day,

02:16.543 --> 02:18.709
but no one could escape that heavy fog.

02:24.126 --> 02:25.584
Major Li only had a few men left.

02:25.793 --> 02:28.459
Nanking was no longer
able to put up a fight,

02:28.793 --> 02:30.751
and those left behind, ran for their lives.

02:59.001 --> 03:00.168
Stop counting.

03:00.334 --> 03:01.834
Shu and two others are missing.

03:40.293 --> 03:41.793
Let us in!

03:41.959 --> 03:43.418
There's no room!

03:43.584 --> 03:45.501
Find your own place to hide!

03:46.293 --> 03:47.334
I said, there's no more room!

03:48.668 --> 03:49.293
Let's go.

04:02.793 --> 04:03.834
Keep going!

04:15.876 --> 04:19.000
Hey.

04:19.959 --> 04:20.918
There are people inside.

04:21.334 --> 04:21.918
Who is there?

04:22.209 --> 04:22.876
Come out!

04:24.834 --> 04:25.626
Come out!

04:31.459 --> 04:32.251
Bastards!

04:34.418 --> 04:35.459
Go to hell!

05:33.376 --> 05:34.084
Stop!

05:36.459 --> 05:37.168
Turn around!

05:43.251 --> 05:44.001
Turn around!

05:50.501 --> 05:51.126
Don't move!

05:52.126 --> 05:53.001
American.

05:53.251 --> 05:54.084
From the refuge.

05:54.251 --> 05:54.793
What?

05:55.001 --> 05:56.084
American.

05:56.959 --> 05:57.793
Not soldier.

06:04.459 --> 06:05.376
John Miller.

06:05.543 --> 06:06.543
Raise your hands!

06:06.834 --> 06:07.918
Working at the church.

06:08.293 --> 06:09.293
Raise your hands!

06:11.376 --> 06:12.626
I said raise your hands!

06:44.834 --> 06:46.001
Separated...

06:46.918 --> 06:49.376
You separated from your families?

06:51.751 --> 06:53.459
You...

06:54.126 --> 06:55.084
families...

06:55.668 --> 06:56.418
separated?

06:57.709 --> 06:58.876
I'm...

06:59.459 --> 07:00.084
going to...

07:01.834 --> 07:03.293
Winchester Cathedral.

07:04.959 --> 07:05.876
You know where it is?

07:07.376 --> 07:09.084
Where?

07:20.084 --> 07:21.084
Mister.

07:21.584 --> 07:22.334
Did you say...

07:23.459 --> 07:24.543
Did you say "mister?"

07:24.876 --> 07:25.751
Who said "mister?"

07:26.793 --> 07:27.709
You speak English?

07:28.084 --> 07:30.959
We are from Winchester Cathedral.

07:32.084 --> 07:33.001
Say that again.

07:34.043 --> 07:36.543
We are from Winchester Cathedral.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.084
You're kidding?

07:40.709 --> 07:42.626
We are students at the convent.

07:43.251 --> 07:44.251
You going there?

07:45.418 --> 07:46.793
Why do you want to go there?

07:48.876 --> 07:50.418
I'm helping to bury your father.

07:51.418 --> 07:53.418
Well, not your father father...

07:53.584 --> 07:54.251
Father Ingleman.

07:54.418 --> 07:55.376
Father Ingleman, yeah.

07:56.001 --> 07:57.084
I'm helping burying him.

07:57.918 --> 07:59.918
Father Ingleman, I'm sending him off...

08:01.709 --> 08:03.126
to heaven or wherever.

08:06.751 --> 08:07.793
You show me the way?

08:47.709 --> 08:48.293
Peng,

08:48.459 --> 08:49.501
move to the flank,

08:49.751 --> 08:51.051
prepare to engage.

08:52.834 --> 08:54.043
Damn it, are you deaf?

08:54.293 --> 08:54.959
Major Li,

08:55.334 --> 08:57.293
we are the last ones left.

08:57.918 --> 08:59.293
We should leave the city now.

09:01.709 --> 09:02.209
Keep fighting.

09:02.751 --> 09:03.251
Yes sir.

09:22.168 --> 09:23.418
Got you!

10:16.334 --> 10:16.709
Let's go.

10:16.876 --> 10:17.418
Yes sir.

10:26.751 --> 10:27.501
That way!

11:04.293 --> 11:05.876
Up there, on the right!

11:47.584 --> 11:48.959
On the left! Fire!

12:24.209 --> 12:24.793
Cover them!

12:46.876 --> 12:49.334
The Chinese army didn't
have adequate weapons

12:49.584 --> 12:51.251
to destroy the enemy's tanks,

12:51.418 --> 12:53.001
so they employed a tactic
from ancient warfare.

12:53.543 --> 12:55.376
They formed a human shield

12:55.584 --> 12:57.668
to get a bomb close to the tanks.

12:58.293 --> 12:59.501
At the time, the Chinese people

12:59.751 --> 13:01.959
couldn't bear the thought
of losing their country,

13:02.293 --> 13:03.876
and such selfless acts were not uncommon.

16:23.001 --> 16:24.126
Zhen!

16:24.751 --> 16:26.293
Let me go!

16:29.168 --> 16:30.001
Zhen!

16:34.918 --> 16:35.459
Come on!

17:04.792 --> 17:05.834
Father Ingleman...

17:06.334 --> 17:07.042
fly away.

17:07.376 --> 17:08.084
Fly away?

17:09.376 --> 17:12.126
On here, Japanese, bomb.

17:13.376 --> 17:15.126
- He flew away with the bomb, right.
- Yes.

17:15.792 --> 17:18.292
Why was the deceased out here?

17:18.667 --> 17:20.792
- Gu. All because of Gu.
- Gu?

17:20.959 --> 17:22.834
He said, bad smell.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.334
He moved the body here.

17:25.501 --> 17:26.334
Who's Gu?

17:26.667 --> 17:28.459
Gu is our cook.

17:28.834 --> 17:30.001
He ran away.

17:30.209 --> 17:31.793
He leaves some students here.

17:31.959 --> 17:34.376
Some students took away by parents.

17:34.959 --> 17:37.001
Some students nowhere to go.

17:39.334 --> 17:40.418
So who's inside?

17:41.126 --> 17:41.918
Just you and the girls?

17:43.001 --> 17:43.834
Just you and the girls.

17:47.376 --> 17:48.459
Even without a body,

17:49.376 --> 17:50.251
you gotta pay me.

17:51.001 --> 17:51.334
No.

17:51.501 --> 17:53.876
No... You gotta pay me.

17:54.043 --> 17:54.843
No.

17:55.293 --> 17:56.084
That's the rule.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.001
There's nothing I can do about it.

17:58.709 --> 17:59.501
With what I came through,

17:59.709 --> 18:01.001
I should raise the price.

18:01.334 --> 18:02.418
So is the money inside?

18:02.584 --> 18:03.376
No. No money.

18:03.543 --> 18:04.918
Money? Inside?

18:05.584 --> 18:06.168
No.

18:06.459 --> 18:07.209
Come on.

18:07.543 --> 18:08.751
There's no money inside?

18:08.918 --> 18:09.334
No.

18:09.501 --> 18:10.084
Let's look.

18:10.543 --> 18:11.668
It's a Catholic church.

18:11.834 --> 18:13.251
There's gotta be some cash inside.

18:13.418 --> 18:14.001
No.

18:14.293 --> 18:14.918
No?

18:15.084 --> 18:16.376
You say anything but no?

18:18.126 --> 18:19.543
Can you fix truck?

18:21.709 --> 18:22.501
Help us.

18:23.126 --> 18:24.126
Leave Nanking.

18:24.501 --> 18:25.209
Fix this truck?

18:26.626 --> 18:27.251
For free?

18:28.709 --> 18:29.293
No.

18:30.668 --> 18:32.209
I can take parts, sell parts.

18:32.376 --> 18:33.209
You got tools?

18:33.876 --> 18:34.501
No.

18:35.251 --> 18:35.918
Let's get inside.

18:40.043 --> 18:41.584
Zhen didn't even make a noise.

18:42.043 --> 18:43.543
Even when they stabbed her over and over,

18:44.668 --> 18:46.376
yet she didn't make a noise.

18:50.418 --> 18:51.793
It's all my fault.

18:53.376 --> 18:54.418
It's not your fault.

18:54.918 --> 18:56.334
It is your fault.

18:57.668 --> 18:59.418
Your father promised to take us

18:59.584 --> 19:02.001
on a boat and leave Nanking.

19:02.251 --> 19:03.043
Where is he?

19:03.418 --> 19:04.668
He ran off.

19:05.084 --> 19:06.376
We waited and waited

19:06.793 --> 19:08.793
and now the Japanese are here.

19:09.043 --> 19:10.793
Now the Japanese are everywhere,

19:10.959 --> 19:13.043
and it's too late to go to the refuge.

19:15.584 --> 19:17.543
Zhen died because of your father!

19:19.251 --> 19:20.084
Shut up!

19:22.084 --> 19:23.793
What are you doing?

19:24.584 --> 19:26.001
Stop!

19:27.001 --> 19:27.959
Stop fighting!

19:28.126 --> 19:28.626
Hey.

19:29.209 --> 19:29.834
Hey.

19:32.043 --> 19:33.543
Hey! Stop!

19:34.709 --> 19:35.376
Stop!

19:39.001 --> 19:41.709
I'm John. Hi.

19:42.501 --> 19:43.459
I'm American.

19:44.084 --> 19:45.626
He's the mortician for Father's funeral.

19:50.459 --> 19:51.584
I know it's hard.

19:52.126 --> 19:53.959
But you've gotta stop fighting everybody.

19:54.251 --> 19:56.376
You know you two... you've seen enough...

19:56.751 --> 19:59.293
seen enough tragedy for a lifetime today.

20:07.418 --> 20:08.209
I can't... um...

20:08.834 --> 20:10.001
I'm not good with kids.

20:10.168 --> 20:11.001
Let's go.

20:11.709 --> 20:14.084
You want some flour? You like some flour?

20:14.251 --> 20:16.834
- Make some bread for the girls.
- Buns.

20:18.001 --> 20:18.709
Buns.

20:18.876 --> 20:19.876
Buns, whatever.

20:20.001 --> 20:21.668
Let's go find the collection box.

20:27.834 --> 20:28.459
Where?

20:29.043 --> 20:30.043
- Upstairs?
- No.

20:34.543 --> 20:35.501
Oh, nice.

20:36.543 --> 20:38.084
Forget going back to the refuge,

20:38.251 --> 20:40.334
I think I'm bunking here tonight.

20:45.793 --> 20:47.376
He's grim, who's that?

20:49.876 --> 20:50.918
Is that Father Ingleman?

20:51.126 --> 20:51.709
Yes.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.084
These North Europeans they're all like,

20:54.251 --> 20:56.501
you know, tuna, playwrights,

20:57.251 --> 20:58.084
not much fun.

20:58.709 --> 20:59.918
Look at that face,

21:00.084 --> 21:02.876
he's ruining the...

21:03.709 --> 21:05.793
What do you call it? Feng... Fengshui?

21:05.959 --> 21:09.376
I can't have a priest staring at me

21:09.584 --> 21:11.709
- while I'm sleeping.
- No...

21:13.001 --> 21:13.876
My father.

21:16.626 --> 21:17.209
Me...

21:18.376 --> 21:19.376
orphan...

21:19.918 --> 21:20.793
adopted.

21:21.126 --> 21:21.709
I'm sorry.

21:21.918 --> 21:22.793
But I just...

21:23.709 --> 21:25.959
It's not good for me to have a priest

21:26.126 --> 21:27.918
staring at me while I'm sleeping.

21:28.251 --> 21:29.001
I can't.

21:29.626 --> 21:32.793
Please, I gotta just... there, better.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.793
You got any drink around here?

21:34.959 --> 21:35.543
No.

21:35.751 --> 21:37.918
You're a church. You got wine, something?

21:38.084 --> 21:38.668
Nothing.

21:39.043 --> 21:39.668
Nothing?

21:48.709 --> 21:51.084
- No.
- No, no...

21:51.959 --> 21:53.251
That's a shaving kit.

21:54.626 --> 21:55.584
What a jerk!

21:57.043 --> 21:58.209
I said you are a jerk!

21:59.793 --> 22:00.918
What did you say your name was?

22:01.751 --> 22:02.584
George Chen.

22:03.126 --> 22:03.918
George.

22:04.418 --> 22:05.251
Tomorrow,

22:06.418 --> 22:07.584
you fix truck,

22:08.834 --> 22:09.459
help us.

22:11.751 --> 22:12.501
Fix truck?

22:14.584 --> 22:15.376
No money!

22:17.043 --> 22:18.001
Money, George.

22:24.209 --> 22:24.793
Gu.

22:24.959 --> 22:26.751
Open the door, it's Ling.

22:27.126 --> 22:28.043
Can you hear me

22:29.626 --> 22:30.959
Gu.

22:31.126 --> 22:32.001
Open up.

22:32.834 --> 22:34.001
It's Ling.

22:34.418 --> 22:35.501
Did you really make a deal with him?

22:35.668 --> 22:36.376
Of course.

22:36.543 --> 22:38.001
Otherwise I wouldn't have brought you here.

22:38.459 --> 22:40.626
Gu.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.084
Open the door, it's Ling.

22:42.251 --> 22:44.001
Gu, have you gone deaf?

22:45.001 --> 22:46.334
Someone's here.

22:46.501 --> 22:47.793
Where's Gu? Ask him to come out.

22:47.959 --> 22:49.126
Go to the refuge on the west side.

22:49.293 --> 22:51.126
Leave now, go to the refuge.

22:51.293 --> 22:53.293
No, we're here for Gu.

22:53.459 --> 22:54.293
Gu's not here.

22:54.459 --> 22:55.626
Bullshit! Get out of my way!

22:56.001 --> 22:56.668
Gu told me,

22:56.834 --> 22:58.459
this church is under Western protection.

22:58.626 --> 22:59.959
The Japanese can't come in.

23:00.126 --> 23:02.334
Bastard! I served Gu all night for free,

23:02.501 --> 23:03.501
he promised to let us stay.

23:03.668 --> 23:04.709
Ask that bastard Gu to come out!

23:04.876 --> 23:05.626
He's really not here.

23:05.793 --> 23:06.293
How come?

23:06.459 --> 23:07.626
He ran off this morning.

23:07.834 --> 23:09.334
You should go to the refuge.

23:29.876 --> 23:30.793
We're not leaving.

23:45.459 --> 23:47.376
Hey! How dare you!

23:48.501 --> 23:49.209
Hurry.

23:49.376 --> 23:50.501
Go to the refuge!

23:50.918 --> 23:51.751
To the refuge!

23:51.918 --> 23:54.043
The refuge doesn't even
have space left for maggots.

23:54.209 --> 23:56.876
Please, have some mercy and let us in.

23:59.501 --> 24:00.834
Don't jump.

24:26.126 --> 24:27.543
They're from the red-light district.

24:27.793 --> 24:28.834
What's that?

24:29.168 --> 24:30.418
It means brothel.

24:37.001 --> 24:39.251
They were the famous women
of the Qin Huai River.

24:39.584 --> 24:40.959
The myths surrounding them

24:41.293 --> 24:43.584
were as ancient as the city of Nanking.

24:51.459 --> 24:53.418
That's a Westerner!

24:53.709 --> 24:54.418
Is he a priest?

24:54.584 --> 24:55.709
No way.

24:55.876 --> 24:57.418
What kind of priest would be such a flirt?

24:57.584 --> 24:58.584
Who cares,

24:58.751 --> 25:00.209
as long as he can protect us.

25:00.376 --> 25:01.251
True.

25:36.084 --> 25:37.168
Come up here.

25:38.084 --> 25:42.043
This was stolen from the bowels of hell.

25:42.459 --> 25:44.584
Long time not make bread.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.001
Long time not make bread? No bread?

25:47.418 --> 25:49.334
Not tonight, tonight we're having bread.

25:52.709 --> 25:55.293
These women quickly took over the cellar.

25:55.668 --> 25:57.793
It was once a filthy, messy place,

25:58.209 --> 25:59.709
but within hours,

26:00.001 --> 26:01.793
they had transformed it
into the Qin Huai River.

26:02.209 --> 26:03.376
The fragrance of rouge and perfume

26:03.543 --> 26:05.251
danced up through the air.

26:27.251 --> 26:28.251
I can smell the bread.

26:28.376 --> 26:29.418
We are coming up!

26:42.251 --> 26:43.876
I couldn't stop them.

26:47.834 --> 26:48.543
Hello.

26:52.334 --> 26:53.501
I remember

26:53.876 --> 26:56.084
when I first saw these women,

26:56.543 --> 26:59.084
they were tramps,
parading around in their lingerie,

26:59.459 --> 27:00.709
not the graceful ladies
that the legends of Qin Huai

27:00.876 --> 27:01.751
had portrayed them to be.

27:06.918 --> 27:08.751
Look, this should be good.

27:26.459 --> 27:27.293
George,

27:27.418 --> 27:28.501
you little shit,

27:28.918 --> 27:30.751
you said there was no wine here.

27:31.334 --> 27:32.084
Excuse me.

27:32.751 --> 27:33.834
What's he saying?

27:36.668 --> 27:38.209
Holy hooch!

27:39.959 --> 27:40.959
How dare you drink the wine!

27:41.126 --> 27:42.334
Now the Westerner knows about the wine.

27:42.501 --> 27:44.126
We sell the wine to raise
money for orphans.

27:44.293 --> 27:45.293
We're all orphans.

27:45.459 --> 27:47.084
We also need help.

27:47.293 --> 27:48.834
That's right.

27:49.126 --> 27:50.126
What are they saying?

27:50.293 --> 27:51.543
They said they're orphans!

27:51.709 --> 27:52.418
Orphans?

27:52.793 --> 27:54.293
Well, I'd like to adopt all of you,

27:54.459 --> 27:55.126
right now.

27:55.418 --> 27:56.834
Adopt all of us?

27:57.334 --> 27:59.084
You would not be able to cope.

28:02.084 --> 28:03.876
You are not the only
ones who speak English!

28:04.043 --> 28:04.668
That's right!

28:07.209 --> 28:07.918
You speak English?

28:21.834 --> 28:23.584
The Westerner is a playboy.

28:23.876 --> 28:25.418
Of course! Haven't you heard?

28:25.584 --> 28:28.709
Westerners with beards are the horniest!

28:29.334 --> 28:31.293
No wonder she is
the top girl of the Qin Huai River.

28:31.459 --> 28:32.876
Mo, use all of your skills.

28:33.043 --> 28:34.751
Seduce him!

28:34.918 --> 28:36.251
That's right.

28:36.418 --> 28:39.334
Make the big nose go crazy for us!

28:47.251 --> 28:48.376
My name is John.

28:50.501 --> 28:51.376
And you are?

28:51.709 --> 28:52.501
Yu Mo.

28:52.834 --> 28:53.751
Yu Mo.

28:54.459 --> 28:55.251
I like that.

28:56.251 --> 28:59.668
So what do you and your companions do?

29:00.793 --> 29:02.043
We are kindergarten teachers.

29:02.209 --> 29:04.168
Really? Kindergarten teachers.

29:04.376 --> 29:05.043
Shameless.

29:05.209 --> 29:05.834
And you?

29:06.001 --> 29:06.918
What do you do?

29:07.334 --> 29:09.251
I'm also a kindergarten teacher.

29:11.876 --> 29:12.876
So as,

29:13.376 --> 29:14.751
teacher to teacher,

29:15.001 --> 29:15.751
you wanna...

29:16.709 --> 29:19.501
get together and have a cup of joe, or...

29:20.001 --> 29:20.834
What're those two yapping about?

29:21.001 --> 29:21.543
Tell me.

29:21.709 --> 29:24.459
Nothing. He's asking your price.

29:24.918 --> 29:25.918
I told him.

29:26.084 --> 29:27.793
He thinks you are too cheap.

30:09.751 --> 30:10.668
There's no coffee.

30:11.084 --> 30:12.293
Let's get liquored up.

30:24.001 --> 30:24.584
Cheers.

30:27.834 --> 30:30.168
The kindergarten fee is enough?

30:42.001 --> 30:42.584
You coming?

30:44.876 --> 30:46.876
I want you to take us out of Nanking.

30:54.418 --> 30:55.126
Yeah.

30:55.834 --> 30:56.376
Right.

30:56.834 --> 30:57.501
We do this first?

30:57.668 --> 30:58.834
I'm serious.

30:59.793 --> 31:02.209
Why else you think we
were flirting with you?

31:05.209 --> 31:06.668
Out of Nanking, how?

31:08.126 --> 31:09.293
I don't know how,

31:09.793 --> 31:12.418
but I know your face is
the way out of here.

31:12.834 --> 31:14.876
The Japanese won't touch Westerners.

31:16.209 --> 31:17.543
Did you see it out there?

31:17.709 --> 31:18.834
That's not happening.

31:21.459 --> 31:21.959
No.

31:23.126 --> 31:23.959
Cash enough?

31:24.793 --> 31:26.334
Cause... let's...

31:38.043 --> 31:39.001
Are you kidding?

31:39.459 --> 31:39.959
Are you kidding?

31:40.126 --> 31:41.084
Wait...

31:41.251 --> 31:43.376
Let's work this out. Let's work it out.

31:44.543 --> 31:45.459
Think about it.

31:45.959 --> 31:47.126
If you help us,

31:47.668 --> 31:48.918
I will thank you in ways

31:49.084 --> 31:51.084
you can never imagine.

31:52.459 --> 31:53.626
All of us Will.

31:56.418 --> 31:57.751
Can I get an advance?

32:22.501 --> 32:24.709
The Japanese have posted a notice,

32:24.918 --> 32:26.793
whoever harbors soldiers will be shot.

32:27.126 --> 32:28.584
I'll shoot you first.

32:28.876 --> 32:30.168
Little bastard.

32:30.459 --> 32:32.209
Open up. Carry that guy in.

33:10.001 --> 33:10.668
Get up.

33:10.918 --> 33:11.793
Get some water.

33:20.418 --> 33:21.168
Hurry up!

33:22.834 --> 33:24.209
What a temper.

33:24.376 --> 33:25.793
He thinks he's so tough.

33:27.084 --> 33:28.251
He thinks he's a hero.

33:28.418 --> 33:30.126
Since he's fighting the Japanese,

33:30.293 --> 33:32.501
protecting Nanking and women like us,

33:32.668 --> 33:34.459
he feels he is entitled to have a temper.

33:34.668 --> 33:37.001
Women like us need to hide here.

33:37.293 --> 33:39.793
But if he hides here, he's a coward.

33:39.959 --> 33:40.501
True.

33:40.668 --> 33:42.001
Yeah, what a sissy!

33:45.876 --> 33:46.793
Got scissors?

33:54.168 --> 33:54.876
Thanks.

34:07.918 --> 34:09.418
- You ruined my dress!
- Don't touch him!

34:11.458 --> 34:12.376
Save your attitude for the Japs.

34:12.543 --> 34:13.708
They are searching for
Chinese soldiers like you.

34:13.876 --> 34:14.833
You are endangering us!

34:15.001 --> 34:16.418
There are convent girls here, too.

34:16.583 --> 34:17.501
Understand?

34:24.583 --> 34:25.251
Towel.

34:38.418 --> 34:39.668
What a handsome face.

34:41.293 --> 34:42.793
Dou has good taste in men.

34:43.251 --> 34:44.876
I mean he looks like my brother.

34:45.376 --> 34:46.958
Are you hot for him?

34:47.126 --> 34:49.293
No, he really looks like my brother.

34:49.458 --> 34:50.751
You have a crush on him.

34:50.918 --> 34:52.208
No, I don't.

34:52.376 --> 34:53.376
Dou, cool off.

34:53.543 --> 34:55.083
He doesn't even have hair down there!

35:04.959 --> 35:06.543
He was homeless, so our troop took him in.

35:06.751 --> 35:07.543
He's called Pu Sheng.

35:07.793 --> 35:08.751
He's just a child.

35:09.043 --> 35:10.293
Why are you leaving him with us?

35:11.751 --> 35:12.334
Get some cloth,

35:12.501 --> 35:13.793
tighten the bandage

35:13.959 --> 35:14.959
so he won't bleed too much.

35:15.793 --> 35:17.209
It's the best I can do.

35:18.418 --> 35:19.584
I want him to be in a warm place

35:19.751 --> 35:21.376
before he dies.

35:23.918 --> 35:24.626
Thank you.

37:05.876 --> 37:06.668
Please wait.

37:15.876 --> 37:16.876
What do you want?

37:17.126 --> 37:18.584
We have sharp tongues,

37:19.126 --> 37:20.751
and we were very rude.

37:21.543 --> 37:23.334
I hope you can forgive us.

37:33.043 --> 37:35.126
Don't point a gun at a man of the cloth.

37:38.293 --> 37:39.043
Mo.

37:39.626 --> 37:41.918
Like me as a priest? Do you?

37:44.043 --> 37:45.376
I dressed up for you.

37:45.709 --> 37:47.043
I got a chance now?

37:52.084 --> 37:53.001
Is he the priest?

37:55.209 --> 37:56.376
Does he belong to the church?

37:57.376 --> 37:58.251
You can say that.

37:59.084 --> 38:01.209
What, the bank's closed
for me, but he gets...

38:01.376 --> 38:04.001
He gets a special soldier
discount or something?

38:06.834 --> 38:07.626
Please tell him,

38:08.334 --> 38:09.626
the students can't end up

38:09.793 --> 38:11.043
in the hands of the Japanese.

38:11.376 --> 38:12.834
Otherwise my men would have died

38:13.376 --> 38:14.418
for nothing.

38:24.543 --> 38:25.751
What's wrong with you?

38:26.251 --> 38:27.126
I want to help you.

38:27.293 --> 38:28.959
I've joined the priesthood.

38:29.126 --> 38:30.709
Stop it. It's not the right time.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.001
You don't want cash.

38:32.168 --> 38:33.251
You want me to save you.

38:33.418 --> 38:34.876
I'm gonna save your soul.

38:35.126 --> 38:37.043
I'll absolve you of your sins tonight.

38:37.293 --> 38:39.459
Blessed are thee among women.

38:39.959 --> 38:42.834
Blessed are thy lips, blessed are thy eyes,

38:43.293 --> 38:44.126
blessed are thy hips...

38:44.293 --> 38:44.876
Don't.

38:45.043 --> 38:47.543
And thy gams, and thy chest...

38:47.709 --> 38:48.584
Stop it!

38:50.418 --> 38:51.293
- Stop it!
- I gotta...

38:51.459 --> 38:52.918
Stop it!

38:53.084 --> 38:54.959
You drunk bastard!

38:58.459 --> 38:59.793
This is a house of love not war,

38:59.959 --> 39:00.959
you get out of here.

39:01.293 --> 39:02.293
Who's he really?

39:02.876 --> 39:04.584
An idiot. Don't mind him.

39:05.793 --> 39:06.751
Fine, I'll leave now.

39:18.626 --> 39:19.293
See,

39:20.793 --> 39:22.293
I'm the only man for you.

39:23.043 --> 39:24.251
You're such a fool!

39:24.459 --> 39:26.501
If it wasn't for your foreign face...

39:26.668 --> 39:27.751
I like it when you're angry.

39:27.918 --> 39:28.793
I wouldn't even look at you!

39:28.959 --> 39:29.626
Harder.

39:29.959 --> 39:31.626
I'll never be into you.

39:32.251 --> 39:32.626
Come here.

39:32.793 --> 39:33.459
Get off me!

39:35.168 --> 39:36.126
I love that!

39:37.126 --> 39:38.834
I love seeing you walk away.

39:39.501 --> 39:41.126
I love seeing that ass.

39:42.084 --> 39:42.751
Mo!

39:44.043 --> 39:45.168
Mo!

39:46.751 --> 39:47.668
That night,

39:47.918 --> 39:49.251
Major Li didn't go far.

39:49.501 --> 39:51.334
He stayed at the paper
shop across the street.

39:51.959 --> 39:52.668
I know,

39:52.876 --> 39:54.834
he could have changed into
civilian clothing and fled.

40:08.751 --> 40:10.251
I said you can't go in!

40:10.626 --> 40:11.793
Little sister,

40:11.959 --> 40:14.168
we won't shit or piss in there.

40:14.418 --> 40:16.334
We just want to wash up.

40:16.501 --> 40:19.251
We always wash before bed-time.

40:19.418 --> 40:20.709
Bed-time?

40:21.168 --> 40:24.834
Morning for you is night for us.

40:25.543 --> 40:25.959
Little sister...

40:26.126 --> 40:27.001
Don't call me sister!

40:27.168 --> 40:28.501
You want to start a fight?

40:28.668 --> 40:29.501
The bathroom is for people.

40:29.668 --> 40:30.876
You mean we are not people?

40:31.043 --> 40:32.376
You know what you are!

40:32.543 --> 40:33.626
You've got some nerve!

40:33.793 --> 40:35.584
We won't share the bathroom with you!

40:36.918 --> 40:38.334
What a temper!

40:38.501 --> 40:40.293
Sorry, go back to your rat hole.

40:41.418 --> 40:42.418
What the hell?

40:42.584 --> 40:43.543
She's humiliating us.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.209
She thinks we are filthy.

40:45.376 --> 40:46.209
Little bitch!

40:46.501 --> 40:47.459
You're the bitch!

40:47.626 --> 40:49.334
Watch your mouth!

40:49.501 --> 40:51.543
Ling, want to see a good fight?

40:51.709 --> 40:52.501
Really?

40:52.709 --> 40:54.876
I thought you'd only fight for Mo.

40:55.709 --> 40:56.876
Let's pull down your pants

40:57.043 --> 40:58.751
and see what you are made of.

40:59.876 --> 41:01.418
Don't touch me, you filthy whore!

41:01.584 --> 41:04.251
Let's find out if you
really are cleaner than us.

41:05.501 --> 41:07.168
Stop it! It's not fair!

41:07.334 --> 41:08.126
I don't have to hit you,

41:08.293 --> 41:09.709
I can just crush you with my butt!

41:10.084 --> 41:12.251
I don't give a damn, I'm going in.

41:12.626 --> 41:13.918
I won't let you go in!

41:16.834 --> 41:17.918
Stop fighting!

41:18.251 --> 41:18.959
What's going on?

41:19.126 --> 41:20.126
Stop!

41:22.334 --> 41:23.126
What are you doing?

41:23.251 --> 41:24.168
Are you crazy?

41:24.793 --> 41:25.876
We are just kids!

41:26.043 --> 41:26.751
Hua, that's enough.

41:26.918 --> 41:27.918
No, it's not over!

41:28.084 --> 41:29.918
I won't let you go in!

41:37.793 --> 41:38.584
Japanese!

41:39.501 --> 41:40.793
Go to the cellar, I'll tell the others!

41:56.709 --> 41:57.834
Search the yard!

42:09.668 --> 42:11.084
Split up!

42:20.084 --> 42:21.168
Hurry! Go to the cellar!

43:01.876 --> 43:02.709
Come in, hurry!

43:08.209 --> 43:10.043
Don't shut it, let the girls in.

43:10.209 --> 43:11.418
Let the girls in!

43:14.459 --> 43:15.043
Hurry!

43:19.168 --> 43:20.001
Don't move!

43:26.418 --> 43:27.418
Lieutenant Asakura!

43:27.584 --> 43:28.751
Come over here!

43:29.501 --> 43:30.209
Upstairs!

44:23.584 --> 44:24.418
Hurry!

44:24.959 --> 44:26.126
Let's move the shelves!

44:30.626 --> 44:31.626
There are girls here!

44:31.959 --> 44:32.834
Search everywhere!

44:33.376 --> 44:34.459
Capture them alive!

46:00.501 --> 46:01.543
Lieutenant Asakura!

46:02.084 --> 46:03.209
Come up here!

46:03.584 --> 46:04.876
We've got virgins!

46:05.418 --> 46:06.626
Hurry!

46:07.543 --> 46:08.376
Stop!

46:10.001 --> 46:10.626
Girls! Girls!

47:02.459 --> 47:03.334
Stop!

47:04.501 --> 47:05.334
Stop!

47:06.584 --> 47:07.418
Stop!

47:08.459 --> 47:10.209
This is a house of the Lord!

47:10.751 --> 47:12.126
These are children!

47:12.584 --> 47:15.876
You are breaking the
laws of man and of God!

47:16.751 --> 47:18.126
No soldiers here!

47:18.293 --> 47:20.334
You have no business being here!

47:21.251 --> 47:22.293
I am the priest!

47:22.668 --> 47:23.876
And I command you,

47:24.126 --> 47:26.876
in the name of the Father to leave now!

47:27.293 --> 47:28.959
Girls, you come up here now!

47:29.626 --> 47:30.626
Come up these stairs,

47:30.834 --> 47:31.751
and stand behind me.

47:33.834 --> 47:34.959
You're honorable men,

47:35.126 --> 47:36.293
behave honorably!

48:11.626 --> 48:15.168
I'll eat you up.

48:37.501 --> 48:40.543
Stop! Stop this! Stop! Run!

48:40.876 --> 48:42.543
Stop this! Don't...

50:14.126 --> 50:15.209
Chinese soldiers!

50:15.668 --> 50:17.334
Get them!

50:18.876 --> 50:19.793
Let's go!

50:27.209 --> 50:29.293
Assemble outside! Roll call!

50:29.459 --> 50:30.668
Prepare for combat!

51:15.376 --> 51:17.001
The sniper is across the street!

51:17.709 --> 51:18.834
To your left!

51:58.293 --> 52:00.459
It's a trap! Find the enemy!

52:31.876 --> 52:32.418
Damn it!

52:32.584 --> 52:34.209
He's in the building there!

52:41.793 --> 52:42.793
Use the grenades!

53:07.626 --> 53:09.293
Behind us! Fire!

53:10.459 --> 53:11.876
Keep firing!

53:59.876 --> 54:00.959
Hold your fire!

54:47.584 --> 54:48.251
Wait!

55:12.959 --> 55:13.584
Fire!

55:59.001 --> 56:00.584
First platoon to the back gate!

56:01.168 --> 56:03.001
Second platoon to the front gate!

56:10.001 --> 56:10.793
Colonel,

56:11.001 --> 56:13.251
he used to work for the traffic department.

56:13.751 --> 56:15.251
Most roads in Nanking are destroyed.

56:15.418 --> 56:16.793
Having him can be useful.

56:17.668 --> 56:18.668
Speak Japanese?

56:18.834 --> 56:19.418
Yes.

56:49.293 --> 56:51.293
Were our soldiers here recently?

56:53.209 --> 56:54.668
Are you the resident priest?

56:57.126 --> 56:57.668
Yes.

56:57.834 --> 56:58.376
Father,

56:58.751 --> 57:01.209
I apologize on behalf of our soldiers.

57:01.709 --> 57:02.793
Please understand.

57:03.084 --> 57:04.376
In the middle of a war,

57:04.709 --> 57:07.543
occasional unfortunate
behavior is inevitable.

57:10.084 --> 57:10.876
Your church

57:11.043 --> 57:12.418
is very beautiful.

57:14.501 --> 57:15.293
How do you do?

57:16.709 --> 57:18.418
Are you students here at the convent?

57:19.084 --> 57:20.501
So sorry to have caused you alarm.

57:20.668 --> 57:21.209
Please...

57:22.418 --> 57:24.084
don't hurt the children any more.

57:24.459 --> 57:25.168
Naturally.

57:25.543 --> 57:26.876
My name is Hasegawa.

57:27.293 --> 57:29.834
I am responsible for the
safety of this area.

57:30.209 --> 57:31.376
Please do not worry...

57:32.084 --> 57:33.709
about the security of the church

57:33.876 --> 57:34.709
and the students.

57:36.376 --> 57:37.543
I apologize...

57:38.209 --> 57:42.418
but I have no confidence...
in that assurance.

57:42.793 --> 57:44.459
My guarantee is effective.

57:44.959 --> 57:45.876
From now on,

57:46.584 --> 57:48.751
I shall post armed guards
in front of the church

57:48.918 --> 57:50.209
to protect you all.

57:58.918 --> 58:00.418
There is not a lot of food

58:00.584 --> 58:02.043
in Nanking at the moment.

58:02.709 --> 58:05.126
I hope the students will not go hungry.

58:14.793 --> 58:15.418
May I?

59:13.251 --> 59:13.793
Thank you.

59:15.668 --> 59:16.543
Did you like it?

59:19.126 --> 59:21.209
This is a Japanese folk song,

59:21.668 --> 59:22.459
"My Home."

59:23.334 --> 59:24.793
It is about hills and rabbits,

59:24.959 --> 59:26.626
and streams full of fish.

59:27.209 --> 59:29.501
It is the most beautiful song in the world

59:29.668 --> 59:31.168
for those who are homesick.

59:39.668 --> 59:41.293
Do the students sing well?

59:45.209 --> 59:46.876
Very well, yes.

59:47.334 --> 59:48.126
That's good.

59:48.584 --> 59:49.334
I shall come back

59:49.501 --> 59:51.084
in a couple of days to hear them.

59:52.918 --> 59:53.543
Why?

59:53.959 --> 59:54.834
No reason.

59:56.251 --> 59:57.876
I happen to love music.

59:58.418 --> 01:00:00.709
Father, we shall meet again soon.

01:00:42.084 --> 01:00:45.918
I hope you will not be
lonely buried together.

01:01:11.126 --> 01:01:12.084
Father John.

01:01:14.126 --> 01:01:16.793
You won't leave us, will you?

01:01:32.293 --> 01:01:34.043
We shouldn't have taken over your cellar.

01:01:34.501 --> 01:01:35.251
Sorry.

01:01:39.293 --> 01:01:40.959
If we hadn't fought with that girl,

01:01:41.126 --> 01:01:42.334
she would still be alive.

01:01:42.709 --> 01:01:43.918
This is all our fault.

01:01:53.626 --> 01:01:54.418
Thank you.

01:02:06.209 --> 01:02:08.209
Why not answer Shu?

01:02:13.001 --> 01:02:14.418
She called me Father John.

01:02:15.334 --> 01:02:16.501
We all need you.

01:02:16.668 --> 01:02:17.793
I'm a mortician.

01:02:18.709 --> 01:02:19.709
You are priest.

01:02:19.876 --> 01:02:20.709
No.

01:02:22.001 --> 01:02:23.168
- If we have a priest...
- George.

01:02:23.334 --> 01:02:25.501
Maybe Japanese...

01:02:25.793 --> 01:02:27.084
not dare...

01:02:27.834 --> 01:02:28.584
You are priest!

01:02:28.751 --> 01:02:30.126
George, I'm not.

01:02:31.834 --> 01:02:33.001
I'm not a priest.

01:02:33.168 --> 01:02:33.626
I'm not!

01:02:33.793 --> 01:02:35.084
I stayed here,

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:38.126
because I was looking for your cash.

01:02:39.209 --> 01:02:41.084
And because that's the nicest bed that

01:02:41.251 --> 01:02:42.709
I've slept in in years. I didn't get there.

01:02:42.876 --> 01:02:45.126
But is that like a priest?
I'm not a priest!

01:02:45.876 --> 01:02:46.459
I'm not.

01:02:46.626 --> 01:02:49.626
I took catechism lessons as a kid.

01:02:49.793 --> 01:02:52.459
Sometimes I remember that when I'm drunk,

01:02:52.626 --> 01:02:54.501
which I am as often as I can be.

01:03:02.876 --> 01:03:04.668
You not be priest.

01:03:05.751 --> 01:03:08.043
Tell girls yourself.

01:03:28.126 --> 01:03:29.626
You little shit!

01:03:32.209 --> 01:03:33.001
You are.

01:03:50.918 --> 01:03:52.834
We've heard about what happen today.

01:03:53.376 --> 01:03:54.459
So you're staying?

01:04:02.876 --> 01:04:03.501
Yeah.

01:04:05.084 --> 01:04:05.709
Even though you were

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:07.501
a drunk bastard last night,

01:04:07.626 --> 01:04:09.584
what you did today makes you a hero.

01:04:15.293 --> 01:04:17.084
I'm sorry about last night.

01:04:19.876 --> 01:04:20.501
Yeah.

01:04:22.876 --> 01:04:24.584
I can't leave them by themselves.

01:04:25.626 --> 01:04:26.293
And that little shit

01:04:26.459 --> 01:04:28.834
has a way of just... you know.

01:04:31.418 --> 01:04:33.501
What do you think the Japanese are up to?

01:04:34.126 --> 01:04:36.418
Are they really here to
protect the students?

01:04:42.834 --> 01:04:44.084
We were counting on having you

01:04:44.251 --> 01:04:45.543
help us leave Nanking.

01:04:45.709 --> 01:04:47.334
But I guess now you'll have to

01:04:47.543 --> 01:04:49.418
stay here and be a priest.

01:04:51.043 --> 01:04:52.793
Yeah, right.

01:04:54.793 --> 01:04:55.459
Priest.

01:04:59.126 --> 01:05:00.543
Actually, I came to tell you,

01:05:00.668 --> 01:05:02.168
our offer is still good.

01:05:02.334 --> 01:05:04.251
We still want you to help us escape.

01:05:04.459 --> 01:05:06.668
As soon as the Japanese guards are gone.

01:05:08.168 --> 01:05:10.084
Just now the ladies were having a bet.

01:05:10.709 --> 01:05:13.168
They said that hero or no hero,

01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:14.376
you don't stand a chance

01:05:14.543 --> 01:05:16.918
when you're up against a beauty like me.

01:05:17.501 --> 01:05:19.126
Don't flatter yourself.

01:05:20.584 --> 01:05:21.334
We'll see.

01:05:50.918 --> 01:05:51.876
Did you like it?

01:05:55.209 --> 01:05:56.209
I only have one string.

01:05:56.376 --> 01:05:58.251
It sound like a beggar's plea. Even worse.

01:06:08.168 --> 01:06:09.209
You're Pu Sheng.

01:06:09.376 --> 01:06:10.251
Born in the Pu region?

01:06:11.584 --> 01:06:12.834
My family is also from there.

01:06:14.084 --> 01:06:14.918
When you're healthy,

01:06:15.209 --> 01:06:16.626
I'll take you to the biggest dance hall,

01:06:16.793 --> 01:06:18.126
to see the prettiest girls.

01:06:19.793 --> 01:06:20.543
Thank you.

01:06:22.209 --> 01:06:22.959
Little hometown fellow,

01:06:23.126 --> 01:06:23.918
don't thank me,

01:06:24.084 --> 01:06:24.876
marry me.

01:06:29.126 --> 01:06:30.668
I'll work in the fields with you.

01:06:32.668 --> 01:06:33.668
I don't have...

01:06:34.584 --> 01:06:35.418
fields.

01:06:36.209 --> 01:06:37.168
What do you have then?

01:06:38.751 --> 01:06:41.084
I don't have anything.

01:06:41.543 --> 01:06:43.918
Then I'll play my pipa everyday.

01:06:44.376 --> 01:06:46.126
When I play, you hold out a bowl.

01:06:46.334 --> 01:06:47.793
We'll beg for food and feed your mom.

01:06:49.293 --> 01:06:50.959
I don't have a mother.

01:06:51.459 --> 01:06:53.459
Everyone in my family is dead.

01:07:57.168 --> 01:07:59.001
If you had just come with me,

01:07:59.584 --> 01:08:01.209
this wouldn't have happened.

01:08:01.543 --> 01:08:03.459
You were so stubborn,

01:08:03.709 --> 01:08:04.959
and wouldn't leave without your classmates.

01:08:05.168 --> 01:08:06.168
How could I have gotten

01:08:06.334 --> 01:08:07.501
that many boat tickets?

01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:09.251
Because of you,

01:08:10.001 --> 01:08:11.543
I'm staying in Nanking.

01:08:17.251 --> 01:08:17.917
Tell me,

01:08:18.084 --> 01:08:19.542
what's this?

01:08:20.001 --> 01:08:21.209
Explain to me,

01:08:21.459 --> 01:08:23.042
why do you do this?

01:08:26.917 --> 01:08:28.042
If I don't do this,

01:08:28.417 --> 01:08:29.501
I can't survive.

01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:31.876
I'm doing this for you.

01:08:32.167 --> 01:08:32.917
You must believe me,

01:08:33.084 --> 01:08:34.751
I would never do anything bad.

01:08:35.459 --> 01:08:36.126
Daughter,

01:08:37.042 --> 01:08:38.334
I will find a way

01:08:38.917 --> 01:08:40.042
to get you out of Nanking.

01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:52.667
No wonder there were no boat tickets.

01:08:52.917 --> 01:08:53.751
Traitor!

01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:29.126
You work for the Japanese?

01:09:29.292 --> 01:09:30.792
Since I cannot save my country,

01:09:30.959 --> 01:09:32.001
cannot save others,

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.792
I can only try to save myself.

01:09:34.292 --> 01:09:36.459
I'm already doing my best, you know.

01:09:36.667 --> 01:09:37.834
Do you think it's easy

01:09:38.001 --> 01:09:39.126
working for the Japanese?

01:09:39.292 --> 01:09:40.501
It's good you work for the Japanese,

01:09:40.667 --> 01:09:41.417
that helps us.

01:09:41.584 --> 01:09:43.209
What is your plan for your daughter?

01:09:43.792 --> 01:09:44.876
I would like to try,

01:09:45.042 --> 01:09:46.876
and use my connections with the Japanese

01:09:47.042 --> 01:09:48.959
to get my daughter out of the city.

01:09:50.292 --> 01:09:51.292
Not to the refuge?

01:09:51.459 --> 01:09:52.251
The refuge?

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:54.126
It's not safe there at all!

01:09:57.043 --> 01:09:58.959
What's your plan for the rest of the girls?

01:10:03.584 --> 01:10:04.293
Mr. Meng?

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:07.126
I have this truck.

01:10:07.293 --> 01:10:09.709
If I can get the right tools,

01:10:09.959 --> 01:10:11.709
then maybe I can get it started.

01:10:11.876 --> 01:10:12.918
Can you help me?

01:10:15.543 --> 01:10:16.668
I have a list here.

01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:17.918
Mr. Meng.

01:10:18.209 --> 01:10:19.584
I need these tools.

01:10:20.168 --> 01:10:21.168
Can you help me get them?

01:10:22.126 --> 01:10:23.876
You're the only one who
can get them for me.

01:10:25.084 --> 01:10:26.209
I need these tools.

01:10:30.501 --> 01:10:31.334
I need these tools.

01:10:31.501 --> 01:10:32.334
Take this.

01:10:33.584 --> 01:10:34.376
Take this.

01:10:39.959 --> 01:10:41.001
If I fix the truck...

01:10:42.168 --> 01:10:44.168
If I fix the truck, what then?

01:10:44.334 --> 01:10:45.209
How would I know?

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:48.668
Wait, wait.

01:10:48.876 --> 01:10:50.251
If I fix the truck,

01:10:50.501 --> 01:10:51.876
what would I need then?

01:10:52.043 --> 01:10:53.459
Of course you'll need a permit.

01:10:53.626 --> 01:10:54.543
I need a permit?

01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:57.584
I need a permit.

01:10:58.918 --> 01:10:59.876
Don't look at me.

01:11:00.751 --> 01:11:01.959
It's too risky!

01:11:25.876 --> 01:11:27.376
Even if you fix the truck,

01:11:27.918 --> 01:11:29.959
how would you get past the Japanese guards?

01:11:30.834 --> 01:11:31.668
I don't know.

01:11:34.626 --> 01:11:36.084
I don't know how long

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:38.251
the guards will stay here.

01:11:39.543 --> 01:11:42.001
But I want to get that truck started

01:11:42.168 --> 01:11:43.376
for when they leave.

01:11:43.584 --> 01:11:46.543
It seems that you know
more than just drinking.

01:11:56.126 --> 01:11:57.959
I don't think she likes seeing us together.

01:11:58.126 --> 01:11:59.334
She has a crush on you.

01:11:59.501 --> 01:12:00.126
Really?

01:12:03.959 --> 01:12:05.376
You know, I was like her.

01:12:07.168 --> 01:12:07.751
Yeah?

01:12:10.001 --> 01:12:12.293
I was at a convent for six years.

01:12:17.084 --> 01:12:19.751
That's where you learned your English?

01:12:26.126 --> 01:12:26.876
What happened?

01:12:28.459 --> 01:12:31.126
Just another story of misfortune.

01:12:31.293 --> 01:12:34.001
It wouldn't interest a
passerby like yourself.

01:12:34.876 --> 01:12:35.626
Yeah, it would.

01:12:36.626 --> 01:12:37.209
Tell me.

01:12:41.668 --> 01:12:42.376
Tell me.

01:12:46.334 --> 01:12:48.793
I was never meant to be like this.

01:12:52.543 --> 01:12:53.459
Never mind.

01:12:55.584 --> 01:12:56.334
You know what?

01:12:57.168 --> 01:12:59.668
I was the best in my English class,

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:02.209
but everyone used to mock me.

01:13:02.668 --> 01:13:04.793
They said I put on airs and graces

01:13:05.334 --> 01:13:09.043
and acted like I was the Queen of England.

01:13:11.668 --> 01:13:13.918
Well, that's not
what you were going to tell me, but...

01:13:15.084 --> 01:13:16.668
So... the Queen of England.

01:13:17.084 --> 01:13:18.168
You mean you're not?

01:13:18.751 --> 01:13:20.376
I thought... yeah.

01:13:22.584 --> 01:13:25.251
Like Shu, I too had a crush on someone.

01:13:25.959 --> 01:13:28.834
But he was a young, fresh-faced guy,

01:13:30.334 --> 01:13:32.543
got the most beautiful eyes,

01:13:34.668 --> 01:13:36.668
not a dirty, bearded man like you.

01:13:41.793 --> 01:13:42.709
OK.

01:14:37.459 --> 01:14:38.293
It's rotten.

01:14:41.334 --> 01:14:41.876
Sister.

01:14:44.001 --> 01:14:44.543
Sister.

01:14:45.751 --> 01:14:46.543
What are you saying?

01:14:47.501 --> 01:14:48.084
Sister...

01:14:48.876 --> 01:14:49.584
Hurry...

01:14:51.459 --> 01:14:52.251
Pu Sheng,

01:14:52.501 --> 01:14:53.584
I'm here.

01:14:55.126 --> 01:14:56.168
Thunder...

01:14:57.209 --> 01:14:58.293
What are you trying to say?

01:15:00.168 --> 01:15:00.751
Rain...

01:15:01.418 --> 01:15:02.251
Rain...

01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:06.918
What rain?

01:15:07.793 --> 01:15:09.626
It's death weeping for you.

01:15:11.168 --> 01:15:15.334
The wheat is drying outside...

01:15:17.043 --> 01:15:20.293
Don't let it get soaked.

01:16:16.334 --> 01:16:18.126
That was the soldier that
the officer brought.

01:16:18.543 --> 01:16:19.876
I heard he was about our age.

01:16:20.584 --> 01:16:21.709
Which officer?

01:16:22.001 --> 01:16:23.668
The officer who saved us that day.

01:16:25.501 --> 01:16:27.501
He hid the soldier inside the cellar,

01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:29.543
and the women were taking care of him.

01:16:30.418 --> 01:16:32.834
Actually those women from the brothel...

01:16:33.501 --> 01:16:34.584
are not that bad.

01:16:36.293 --> 01:16:37.209
Where's Dou?

01:16:40.334 --> 01:16:41.543
Lan's missing too.

01:16:41.876 --> 01:16:42.668
Really?

01:16:43.418 --> 01:16:45.126
Haven't seen them for a while.

01:16:45.751 --> 01:16:46.876
Are they still in the cellar?

01:16:47.543 --> 01:16:48.793
Have you seen Dou?

01:16:55.793 --> 01:16:58.209
Dou and Lan got out.

01:16:58.834 --> 01:16:59.543
How?

01:16:59.709 --> 01:17:00.626
Where did they go?

01:17:00.918 --> 01:17:03.334
Dou insisted on getting pipa strings.

01:17:03.793 --> 01:17:05.668
She wanted to play the pipa for Pu Sheng.

01:17:06.126 --> 01:17:07.376
She said he had a hard life,

01:17:07.626 --> 01:17:08.876
and he was like her brother.

01:17:09.418 --> 01:17:11.834
She wanted to play something nice for him,

01:17:12.126 --> 01:17:13.543
but one string wasn't enough,

01:17:13.751 --> 01:17:15.459
she needed three more.

01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:16.418
What about Lan?

01:17:16.751 --> 01:17:17.584
Why did she go?

01:17:17.918 --> 01:17:20.626
She said she left her earrings behind.

01:17:21.251 --> 01:17:22.251
How could they leave?

01:17:22.751 --> 01:17:24.043
The Japanese are guarding the gates.

01:17:24.251 --> 01:17:26.501
I don't know how they got out.

01:17:26.751 --> 01:17:28.709
They disappeared when it was dark.

01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:29.959
Dou said that

01:17:30.668 --> 01:17:31.418
if she didn't go soon

01:17:31.584 --> 01:17:33.084
it would be too late for him.

01:17:33.293 --> 01:17:34.626
Why didn't you stop them!

01:17:34.793 --> 01:17:36.668
I tried, but it didn't work!

01:17:43.251 --> 01:17:44.043
What happened?

01:17:44.334 --> 01:17:46.543
Dou and Lan snuck out on their own.

01:17:47.293 --> 01:17:48.418
Dou and Lan?

01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:51.126
How? How did they leave?

01:17:51.334 --> 01:17:52.251
I don't know.

01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:53.459
You know when?

01:17:53.626 --> 01:17:54.293
No.

01:17:55.334 --> 01:17:56.126
Where did they go?

01:17:56.418 --> 01:17:59.084
They went back to our brothel
to get pipa strings.

01:18:10.126 --> 01:18:12.126
You want me to... go find them?

01:18:12.293 --> 01:18:12.793
Yeah.

01:18:14.959 --> 01:18:16.126
Mo, I'm not sure...

01:18:16.334 --> 01:18:17.168
Please.

01:18:19.418 --> 01:18:21.209
Please. Please!

01:18:30.376 --> 01:18:31.334
Alright, it's safer for me

01:18:31.459 --> 01:18:33.043
than anyone else, so I'll try.

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:34.459
I'll try.

01:18:35.168 --> 01:18:37.668
If I can leave. If they let me leave.

01:18:39.626 --> 01:18:41.418
Candles, food.

01:18:41.876 --> 01:18:43.126
There is no food.

01:18:43.834 --> 01:18:44.709
They need food.

01:18:45.334 --> 01:18:46.251
With no food.

01:18:46.918 --> 01:18:47.709
No singing.

01:18:48.293 --> 01:18:51.168
Hasegawa asks girls to sing.

01:18:52.459 --> 01:18:54.251
Sing for the girls.

01:18:54.668 --> 01:18:56.418
Hasegawa asks.

01:18:58.251 --> 01:19:00.626
But no singing with no food.

01:19:01.709 --> 01:19:03.209
And candles for Hasegawa.

01:19:03.751 --> 01:19:04.584
I go get food.

01:19:04.751 --> 01:19:06.834
Girl sing. Hasegawa happy. Yes?

01:19:07.001 --> 01:19:07.751
I go now.

01:19:07.918 --> 01:19:09.876
George, you're not coming.

01:19:10.834 --> 01:19:12.501
I go, for food?

01:19:12.834 --> 01:19:13.418
Yes?

01:19:13.584 --> 01:19:14.584
George, you're not coming.

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:16.084
Go back inside!

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:16.959
Yes?

01:19:17.334 --> 01:19:18.501
Make Hasegawa happy.

01:19:19.501 --> 01:19:20.043
Go!

01:19:20.209 --> 01:19:21.709
This is fine, I go. Thank you.

01:19:25.793 --> 01:19:27.709
Officer, is he allowed to leave?

01:19:27.876 --> 01:19:30.043
We've been told not to let the girls leave.

01:19:30.293 --> 01:19:31.251
But he's the priest.

01:19:59.251 --> 01:19:59.959
Terry?

01:20:02.918 --> 01:20:03.543
Terry.

01:20:03.959 --> 01:20:04.709
John?

01:20:06.084 --> 01:20:06.876
I tried getting back,

01:20:07.043 --> 01:20:07.959
I tried getting back to the refuge.

01:20:08.126 --> 01:20:08.751
I got stuck.

01:20:09.251 --> 01:20:10.168
I couldn't get back.

01:20:10.334 --> 01:20:11.584
I was trying to get back. I'm sorry.

01:20:11.751 --> 01:20:13.918
I thought you were... I
figured you were dead.

01:20:14.084 --> 01:20:14.959
I'm looking for two women,

01:20:15.126 --> 01:20:16.126
they got shiny dresses.

01:20:16.293 --> 01:20:18.251
I need to find them. They are in trouble.

01:20:18.418 --> 01:20:19.918
Why are you dressed like this?
What is this?

01:20:20.084 --> 01:20:21.918
I got drunk, I woke up, I was just...

01:20:22.084 --> 01:20:23.501
dressed as a priest.

01:20:25.584 --> 01:20:26.334
Who is this?

01:20:26.584 --> 01:20:27.751
This is George. This is George.

01:20:27.918 --> 01:20:28.668
Have you seen them?

01:20:28.834 --> 01:20:29.334
Seen who?

01:20:29.501 --> 01:20:30.251
The women!

01:20:30.584 --> 01:20:32.584
There're women piled up
all over the street.

01:20:32.751 --> 01:20:33.751
You haven't seen them?

01:20:33.918 --> 01:20:35.459
No, I haven't seen any women. No.

01:20:35.626 --> 01:20:37.501
You think it's safe to be
looking at the women right now?

01:20:37.668 --> 01:20:38.793
Can you help me with tools?

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:39.751
Tools for what?

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:40.918
I gotta fix a truck.

01:20:41.084 --> 01:20:42.001
Fix a truck for what?

01:20:42.168 --> 01:20:43.001
I gotta help George,

01:20:43.168 --> 01:20:44.126
I gotta help some girls,

01:20:44.293 --> 01:20:46.209
I gotta help some women,
they're prostitutes,

01:20:46.376 --> 01:20:46.959
and I gotta help them.

01:20:47.126 --> 01:20:47.959
What? Are you kidding me?

01:20:48.126 --> 01:20:49.584
You're talking about
prostitutes and trucks,

01:20:49.751 --> 01:20:50.459
and tools.

01:20:50.626 --> 01:20:52.376
I'm talking about not dying in China.

01:20:52.543 --> 01:20:53.751
I'm leaving right now.

01:20:54.126 --> 01:20:55.293
You're leaving Nanking right now?

01:20:55.459 --> 01:20:56.334
Do you wanna go?

01:20:57.001 --> 01:20:58.959
There's a boat. It's waiting for us.

01:20:59.334 --> 01:21:00.668
I'm leaving right now!

01:21:00.834 --> 01:21:02.376
If you wanna go, then let's go!

01:21:03.584 --> 01:21:04.668
It's your last chance.

01:21:09.959 --> 01:21:10.668
I gotta find them.

01:21:10.834 --> 01:21:11.543
I can't leave.

01:21:12.001 --> 01:21:13.168
Are you kidding me right now?

01:21:13.584 --> 01:21:14.501
I'll see you, Terry!

01:21:15.626 --> 01:21:16.501
I'll see ya.

01:22:18.209 --> 01:22:18.959
Take off your coat!

01:22:20.418 --> 01:22:20.918
Hurry!

01:22:24.876 --> 01:22:26.043
They went that way.

01:22:29.251 --> 01:22:30.043
Those are their coats.

01:22:31.918 --> 01:22:34.751
Look! Those are young girls' coats!

01:22:35.043 --> 01:22:36.043
The girls can't be far.

01:22:45.918 --> 01:22:47.751
Oh no, I dropped the strings!

01:22:49.334 --> 01:22:49.834
Forget it.

01:22:50.001 --> 01:22:51.418
No, I have to find them.

01:23:42.126 --> 01:23:42.959
Over there!

01:23:43.126 --> 01:23:44.418
Don't shoot!

01:23:46.168 --> 01:23:46.959
Lan!

01:23:47.501 --> 01:23:48.293
Lan!

01:23:48.626 --> 01:23:50.126
Don't run!

01:23:57.584 --> 01:23:58.334
Bitch!

01:23:58.959 --> 01:24:00.001
Go to hell!

01:24:00.293 --> 01:24:01.126
We'll deal with her later.

01:24:01.293 --> 01:24:02.334
Let's catch the other one.

01:24:02.584 --> 01:24:03.293
Let's go!

01:24:14.834 --> 01:24:16.001
Here she is!

01:24:33.626 --> 01:24:35.501
Why am I always the last one?

01:24:35.709 --> 01:24:37.043
You shouldn't have shot the other girl.

01:24:37.209 --> 01:24:38.001
It's not fair!

01:24:38.168 --> 01:24:39.168
Hurry!

01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:49.126
Fuck you!

01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:50.959
Fuck you all!

01:24:56.501 --> 01:24:59.376
Bitch! You bit me!

01:24:59.959 --> 01:25:02.209
I'll kill you!

01:25:04.584 --> 01:25:05.793
What an idiot! You got bitten!

01:25:05.959 --> 01:25:07.751
You can only handle the dead one upstairs!

01:26:13.751 --> 01:26:15.584
Is it? George, yes?

01:26:16.418 --> 01:26:16.959
Is it?

01:26:19.793 --> 01:26:20.293
Is it?

01:26:21.001 --> 01:26:21.543
Yes?

01:26:33.251 --> 01:26:35.543
Stay there, stay there.

01:27:07.334 --> 01:27:08.376
They were on their way back.

01:27:15.001 --> 01:27:17.168
It was a stray bullet or... maybe...

01:27:17.334 --> 01:27:18.084
I don't know.

01:27:22.793 --> 01:27:23.876
I don't think they suffered.

01:27:25.251 --> 01:27:26.293
I don't think so.

01:27:28.751 --> 01:27:29.709
Is that true?

01:27:31.584 --> 01:27:32.168
Yes.

01:27:37.043 --> 01:27:37.543
He said

01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:41.084
Dou and Lan were hit by stray bullets

01:27:42.751 --> 01:27:44.043
that they didn't suffer.

01:27:57.834 --> 01:27:58.584
Come in.

01:28:00.251 --> 01:28:00.959
George.

01:28:02.001 --> 01:28:03.251
Come in. George.

01:28:04.668 --> 01:28:05.334
It's me.

01:28:09.001 --> 01:28:10.418
I only have two minutes.

01:28:11.709 --> 01:28:13.459
The guards finally let me in.

01:28:14.418 --> 01:28:15.126
These tools

01:28:15.293 --> 01:28:15.918
you need.

01:28:19.418 --> 01:28:20.001
Thank you.

01:28:21.376 --> 01:28:22.209
Now, listen to me.

01:28:22.626 --> 01:28:25.501
- This permit was for my daughter.
- Right.

01:28:25.709 --> 01:28:27.793
But I can't carry out my plan.

01:28:28.751 --> 01:28:30.084
You are my only hope now.

01:28:31.834 --> 01:28:33.501
The Japanese don't trust me any more.

01:28:33.668 --> 01:28:34.418
You are a Westerner.

01:28:34.584 --> 01:28:35.626
You can help her.

01:28:37.126 --> 01:28:39.584
My daughter wouldn't leave
without her classmates.

01:28:39.959 --> 01:28:42.543
Please think of a way to
get her out of Nanking.

01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:45.418
The permit is only good for a short time.

01:28:46.043 --> 01:28:47.709
When you manage to leave the church,

01:28:47.918 --> 01:28:50.001
remember, head west.

01:28:50.501 --> 01:28:52.334
There's a way out of the city there.

01:28:53.293 --> 01:28:54.334
I have to go.

01:28:54.918 --> 01:28:55.584
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

01:28:55.751 --> 01:28:57.001
Mr. Meng, thank you.

01:28:57.168 --> 01:28:57.626
Mr. Meng,

01:28:57.793 --> 01:28:59.126
with your connections...

01:28:59.293 --> 01:29:00.334
is there anything else
you can do for us...?

01:29:00.501 --> 01:29:01.543
No, no, sorry.

01:29:01.834 --> 01:29:02.459
John,

01:29:03.084 --> 01:29:05.126
I'm handing my daughter over to you.

01:29:06.876 --> 01:29:08.418
I have promised her mother,

01:29:09.126 --> 01:29:10.834
I'll take good care of her.

01:29:11.084 --> 01:29:11.626
OK.

01:29:12.168 --> 01:29:12.793
Please.

01:29:15.626 --> 01:29:16.459
Mr. Meng,

01:29:16.834 --> 01:29:17.501
thank you.

01:29:17.918 --> 01:29:18.959
Thank you for this.

01:29:19.293 --> 01:29:20.334
You are a good man.

01:29:21.918 --> 01:29:23.293
In the eyes of my daughter,

01:29:24.084 --> 01:29:25.084
I'm a bad man,

01:29:25.751 --> 01:29:26.459
a traitor.

01:29:26.876 --> 01:29:27.418
No.

01:29:28.793 --> 01:29:29.459
Thank you.

01:30:33.501 --> 01:30:35.251
Damn Mosquito, her cat ran off.

01:30:35.418 --> 01:30:36.334
She went up to look for it.

01:31:05.584 --> 01:31:06.209
Good.

01:31:07.418 --> 01:31:08.834
You sing very well.

01:31:23.876 --> 01:31:24.668
Haven't I told you?

01:31:25.043 --> 01:31:26.126
You can't come out!

01:31:27.543 --> 01:31:28.376
Officer,

01:31:29.168 --> 01:31:32.001
this student has lost her uniform.

01:31:32.543 --> 01:31:35.251
Because we wanted to look our best today,

01:31:36.209 --> 01:31:39.584
we asked her not to
participate in the performance.

01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:42.543
Please forgive the intrusion.

01:31:55.418 --> 01:31:56.001
Father,

01:31:56.959 --> 01:31:58.918
I would like to announce some good news.

01:31:59.709 --> 01:32:01.376
Tomorrow our division is celebrating

01:32:01.543 --> 01:32:03.793
the successful occupation of Nanking.

01:32:04.209 --> 01:32:05.251
Esteemed Father,

01:32:05.793 --> 01:32:07.376
on behalf of all the officers,

01:32:07.626 --> 01:32:09.626
I would like to invite your church choir

01:32:09.793 --> 01:32:11.751
to perform and celebrate with us.

01:32:22.209 --> 01:32:24.251
This is the official invitation.

01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:31.293
They are asking us to
sing at a party tomorrow.

01:32:35.376 --> 01:32:36.751
This is a very kind invitation,

01:32:37.126 --> 01:32:38.001
Mr. Hasegawa.

01:32:39.084 --> 01:32:40.459
However, unfortunately,

01:32:40.626 --> 01:32:42.459
the children will not be able to attend.

01:32:42.959 --> 01:32:43.751
Why not?

01:32:43.918 --> 01:32:45.126
Sir, they're very young.

01:32:45.793 --> 01:32:47.751
I'm not sure that it is appropriate

01:32:47.918 --> 01:32:49.668
for them to attend an adults' party.

01:32:49.918 --> 01:32:51.459
As their guardian and protector,

01:32:51.626 --> 01:32:52.793
that's my responsibility.

01:32:53.751 --> 01:32:54.959
But we thank you very much.

01:32:57.209 --> 01:32:58.126
I am sorry.

01:32:58.376 --> 01:32:59.959
This is an order from above.

01:33:00.293 --> 01:33:01.501
I cannot disobey.

01:33:07.084 --> 01:33:07.668
Sir.

01:33:08.001 --> 01:33:09.334
Please think about the girls.

01:33:09.918 --> 01:33:12.084
I can see that you are a man with culture.

01:33:12.251 --> 01:33:14.001
Last time you played us a beautiful song,

01:33:14.168 --> 01:33:15.834
for people far from home.

01:33:16.293 --> 01:33:19.209
You missed the rivers and hills.

01:33:19.876 --> 01:33:22.418
Please consider that theirs
have been destroyed,

01:33:22.793 --> 01:33:24.876
they have no home, nothing.

01:33:25.668 --> 01:33:26.876
They are living in hell.

01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:28.501
With this invitation,

01:33:28.668 --> 01:33:30.793
you are asking them to celebrate that.

01:33:31.334 --> 01:33:32.668
I know that you understand.

01:33:32.876 --> 01:33:34.209
With respect, sir,

01:33:34.626 --> 01:33:36.668
I cannot allow that. I think that is...

01:33:39.084 --> 01:33:40.501
I think that is brutal, sir.

01:33:43.751 --> 01:33:44.959
Please remember,

01:33:46.001 --> 01:33:47.293
tomorrow at four in the afternoon,

01:33:47.459 --> 01:33:49.293
a car will come to pick up the students.

01:33:49.709 --> 01:33:52.001
I am carrying out military orders.

01:33:52.168 --> 01:33:53.084
Mr. Hasegawa,

01:33:54.626 --> 01:33:57.084
you tell me what will happen
at these celebrations.

01:34:01.918 --> 01:34:04.209
Mr. Hasegawa.

01:34:07.126 --> 01:34:09.709
You said you posted
guards for our security.

01:34:10.043 --> 01:34:11.043
Have you been keeping these girls

01:34:11.209 --> 01:34:13.209
locked up until these celebrations?

01:34:17.793 --> 01:34:20.043
The children cannot go.

01:34:22.126 --> 01:34:23.126
Mr. Hasegawa.

01:34:24.168 --> 01:34:25.251
Mr. Hasegawa!

01:34:26.126 --> 01:34:27.918
The children cannot go!

01:34:29.626 --> 01:34:31.084
The children cannot go!

01:34:46.584 --> 01:34:49.001
One, two, three, four,

01:34:49.168 --> 01:34:51.418
five, six, seven, eight,

01:34:51.584 --> 01:34:53.251
night, ten, eleven,

01:34:53.418 --> 01:34:55.168
twelve, thirteen.

01:34:56.751 --> 01:34:57.584
All,

01:34:59.001 --> 01:34:59.918
must go!

01:35:22.293 --> 01:35:23.126
Father John,

01:35:25.251 --> 01:35:27.626
what do the Japanese want us to do?

01:35:27.876 --> 01:35:29.459
Do they want us to sing?

01:35:30.126 --> 01:35:30.834
Yeah.

01:35:33.293 --> 01:35:34.459
I'm not a student.

01:35:35.126 --> 01:35:36.418
I don't have to go.

01:35:41.209 --> 01:35:42.751
Well, I'm not a student.

01:35:43.418 --> 01:35:44.293
I won't go.

01:35:44.543 --> 01:35:45.126
You have to!

01:35:45.293 --> 01:35:46.459
The Japanese have counted you!

01:35:46.626 --> 01:35:48.168
I don't care, I won't go!

01:35:48.334 --> 01:35:49.418
You have to go!

01:35:49.751 --> 01:35:51.001
Now you're saying you aren't a student.

01:35:51.168 --> 01:35:52.543
Why didn't you tell the Japanese earlier?

01:35:57.668 --> 01:36:00.751
Stop staring at me!

01:36:00.959 --> 01:36:02.584
Save your attitude for the Japanese!

01:36:04.001 --> 01:36:04.501
Do you think the Japanese

01:36:04.668 --> 01:36:06.084
really invited you to sing?

01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:07.668
Dream on!

01:36:08.251 --> 01:36:10.126
What do they do all day in Nanking?

01:36:10.543 --> 01:36:12.168
They murder, burn,

01:36:12.334 --> 01:36:13.293
and rape!

01:36:13.584 --> 01:36:14.334
You know?

01:36:14.501 --> 01:36:16.126
Go ahead and go,

01:36:16.501 --> 01:36:17.251
but I won't go!

01:36:17.418 --> 01:36:18.501
Mosquito, you shut up!

01:36:22.209 --> 01:36:23.501
You are all mean to me!

01:36:23.668 --> 01:36:25.376
I'm not going!

01:36:43.709 --> 01:36:45.959
That's not true what she said.

01:36:46.876 --> 01:36:49.834
These men are different from the others.

01:36:50.709 --> 01:36:52.084
These men are educated.

01:36:52.668 --> 01:36:53.709
They are officers.

01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:55.876
These men are gentlemen.

01:36:57.876 --> 01:37:01.376
I've been to things like
these before, and...

01:37:02.001 --> 01:37:02.918
it's nice.

01:37:03.126 --> 01:37:05.376
It's elegant, it's a...

01:37:05.793 --> 01:37:06.709
It's a party.

01:37:07.876 --> 01:37:08.959
There's nice things at parties.

01:37:09.126 --> 01:37:10.501
There's cakes and there's flowers

01:37:10.668 --> 01:37:12.293
and there's chocolates
and there's dancing...

01:37:12.459 --> 01:37:15.418
and there's... all of these things,
which are lovely.

01:37:17.376 --> 01:37:19.376
Please don't think about what she said.

01:37:22.834 --> 01:37:24.293
I'm a terrible dancer,

01:37:25.418 --> 01:37:26.751
and maybe one day one of you could

01:37:26.918 --> 01:37:29.418
teach me how to dance. That would be nice.

01:37:33.084 --> 01:37:34.501
Please don't think about that.

01:37:35.459 --> 01:37:36.709
Because that's not true.

01:38:02.209 --> 01:38:03.001
I...

01:38:05.626 --> 01:38:06.918
lied to you as well.

01:38:07.543 --> 01:38:10.459
Your two friends who went
for the pipa strings,

01:38:10.918 --> 01:38:12.126
they weren't shot.

01:38:14.168 --> 01:38:14.876
I'm sorry.

01:38:15.668 --> 01:38:17.001
I think you already knew.

01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:19.293
Yes.

01:38:23.751 --> 01:38:24.626
Sometimes,

01:38:24.793 --> 01:38:27.709
the truth is the last
thing we need to hear.

01:38:41.126 --> 01:38:43.043
I heard what you said to the girls.

01:38:44.543 --> 01:38:45.668
What are you gonna do?

01:38:46.209 --> 01:38:47.876
I gotta get the truck started.

01:38:49.376 --> 01:38:50.376
And after that?

01:38:54.501 --> 01:38:55.834
I have an idea.

01:38:57.084 --> 01:38:59.001
Maybe I can save one of them,

01:38:59.793 --> 01:39:00.543
with your help.

01:39:01.459 --> 01:39:02.043
How?

01:39:02.751 --> 01:39:03.501
The Japanese thought

01:39:03.668 --> 01:39:05.668
Mosquito was one of the girls.

01:39:06.334 --> 01:39:07.418
She tricked them.

01:39:08.001 --> 01:39:08.834
Why can't I?

01:39:12.334 --> 01:39:12.959
No.

01:39:13.668 --> 01:39:15.043
If you're saying what I
think you're saying,

01:39:15.209 --> 01:39:17.043
no.

01:39:18.209 --> 01:39:19.209
That's not happening.

01:39:21.501 --> 01:39:22.709
Remember? Like them,

01:39:22.876 --> 01:39:24.959
I was at a convent for six years.

01:39:28.376 --> 01:39:29.376
But unlike them,

01:39:30.334 --> 01:39:32.251
I was raped by my stepfather

01:39:32.418 --> 01:39:34.626
when I was thirteen years old.

01:39:39.626 --> 01:39:40.834
By their age,

01:39:42.126 --> 01:39:45.501
I was already forced to
take my first clients.

01:39:49.959 --> 01:39:51.709
I don't want them to go through that.

01:39:55.251 --> 01:39:57.084
But I can't let you do that, Mo.

01:40:00.334 --> 01:40:01.751
I can't let you do that.

01:40:13.084 --> 01:40:13.793
What are you doing?

01:40:14.918 --> 01:40:15.709
Get back in.

01:40:16.668 --> 01:40:17.668
You can't leave.

01:40:18.251 --> 01:40:18.918
Get back in!

01:40:19.418 --> 01:40:20.126
Get in there!

01:40:21.418 --> 01:40:22.718
What are you doing?

01:40:23.626 --> 01:40:24.418
Go back!

01:40:26.543 --> 01:40:27.376
I said go back in!

01:40:59.709 --> 01:41:00.876
I will be the first.

01:41:01.626 --> 01:41:03.793
Remember who's in front of you.

01:41:04.084 --> 01:41:05.043
When we go,

01:41:05.209 --> 01:41:06.709
we will stick to this order.

01:41:07.459 --> 01:41:09.959
Shu, isn't there a better solution?

01:41:10.626 --> 01:41:11.543
No.

01:41:12.543 --> 01:41:13.668
We won't let the Japanese

01:41:13.834 --> 01:41:15.376
hurt us again.

01:41:46.293 --> 01:41:46.876
Girls.

01:41:47.293 --> 01:41:48.334
Shu!

01:41:48.501 --> 01:41:49.376
Wait, just...

01:41:50.584 --> 01:41:51.376
Go away!

01:41:51.543 --> 01:41:52.084
Come down!

01:41:52.251 --> 01:41:53.334
OK, OK.

01:41:53.501 --> 01:41:55.168
Stay back, OK.

01:41:55.501 --> 01:41:56.793
Don't do anything foolish!

01:41:56.959 --> 01:41:58.001
So many people have died.

01:41:58.168 --> 01:41:59.168
Even hell is packed.

01:41:59.376 --> 01:42:00.668
Why should you add to the crowd?

01:42:04.293 --> 01:42:06.584
Shu, don't do this.

01:42:06.834 --> 01:42:08.043
You can't do this!

01:42:08.459 --> 01:42:10.209
We can't just throw our lives away.

01:42:10.668 --> 01:42:12.459
Life is a sacred gift.

01:42:12.959 --> 01:42:14.668
It's not ours to throw away.

01:42:16.668 --> 01:42:18.293
Keep away! Step back!

01:42:18.584 --> 01:42:19.376
OK.

01:42:19.876 --> 01:42:22.834
We're stepping back.

01:42:24.251 --> 01:42:24.918
Come up!

01:42:25.751 --> 01:42:27.209
Didn't we say we are
going to jump together?

01:42:28.418 --> 01:42:29.084
UP here!

01:42:30.834 --> 01:42:31.501
Come up now!

01:42:32.668 --> 01:42:34.876
Listen to me, Shu, I have an idea.

01:42:35.084 --> 01:42:35.918
I will go in your place.

01:42:38.418 --> 01:42:39.751
Tell the girls to get down.

01:42:40.376 --> 01:42:41.293
Tomorrow I will go for you.

01:42:41.668 --> 01:42:43.334
Did you hear me? I will go in your place!

01:42:44.168 --> 01:42:46.793
What? Who is going in who's place?

01:42:51.543 --> 01:42:52.751
I will also go for you.

01:42:52.918 --> 01:42:53.793
Right, we will all go instead of you.

01:42:53.959 --> 01:42:54.668
We can handle the Japs.

01:42:54.834 --> 01:42:55.834
We will protect you.

01:42:56.001 --> 01:42:56.668
We will replace you!

01:42:56.834 --> 01:42:58.584
Don't worry, you have us to protect you.

01:42:58.751 --> 01:43:00.459
Yes, we won't let the Japanese hurt you.

01:43:00.626 --> 01:43:01.543
Do you hear us?

01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:02.918
We will go in your place.

01:43:03.084 --> 01:43:05.293
Come down and don't jump.

01:43:05.459 --> 01:43:06.459
Come down.

01:43:06.751 --> 01:43:09.043
We're telling them the
idea I told you about.

01:43:11.459 --> 01:43:14.126
It's a good idea. That's it, girls.

01:43:14.459 --> 01:43:15.751
Shu, come here,

01:43:15.918 --> 01:43:17.459
it's a good idea.

01:43:17.709 --> 01:43:18.959
We can trick the Japanese.

01:43:19.584 --> 01:43:21.043
Alright? We'll make it fun.

01:43:21.251 --> 01:43:23.251
Come down, we think about it.

01:43:23.543 --> 01:43:25.418
We just come down, and think about it.

01:43:26.543 --> 01:43:27.584
We can make it work.

01:43:35.834 --> 01:43:37.418
We only said it so they would

01:43:37.584 --> 01:43:38.501
get down from the tower.

01:43:41.751 --> 01:43:44.043
But you shouldn't have lied to them.

01:43:44.501 --> 01:43:45.543
Hua, remember?

01:43:45.709 --> 01:43:46.626
If you weren't lied to,

01:43:46.793 --> 01:43:48.626
you wouldn't have ended up in a brothel.

01:43:48.793 --> 01:43:50.668
Shut up! Mosquito.

01:43:50.959 --> 01:43:51.918
I'm not stupid.

01:43:52.126 --> 01:43:53.584
If nobody goes you'll still have to go.

01:43:53.751 --> 01:43:55.918
You were counted by the Japanese!

01:43:58.959 --> 01:44:01.043
Unless the Japanese are insane,

01:44:01.209 --> 01:44:02.876
I don't think they will kill us.

01:44:03.626 --> 01:44:05.126
They just want pleasure.

01:44:05.459 --> 01:44:06.834
That's what we do.

01:44:07.543 --> 01:44:09.043
We have experienced all kinds of men.

01:44:09.626 --> 01:44:11.001
As long as we can get out alive,

01:44:11.376 --> 01:44:12.793
we will find a way to survive.

01:44:13.584 --> 01:44:14.209
Ling,

01:44:14.918 --> 01:44:15.959
how do you expect the girls

01:44:16.126 --> 01:44:17.043
to handle the Japanese?

01:44:18.793 --> 01:44:20.001
Even if they make it back alive,

01:44:21.209 --> 01:44:22.334
they won't be able to carry on.

01:44:24.459 --> 01:44:25.751
I just don't think it's worth it.

01:44:26.793 --> 01:44:28.501
They wouldn't even let us use the bathroom,

01:44:28.793 --> 01:44:29.959
yet, we're supposed to kiss their asses,

01:44:30.293 --> 01:44:31.668
and sacrifice ourselves for them?

01:44:31.834 --> 01:44:33.709
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

01:44:34.543 --> 01:44:36.584
If Shu hadn't diverted
the Japs the other day,

01:44:37.126 --> 01:44:39.418
where would we all be right now?

01:44:43.543 --> 01:44:45.626
Remember how the ancient poem describes us?

01:44:48.543 --> 01:44:49.959
"Prostitutes never care
about a falling nation,"

01:44:50.126 --> 01:44:51.626
"they sing and dance
while others are dying."

01:44:51.918 --> 01:44:53.543
You are not so foolish after all.

01:44:53.918 --> 01:44:55.251
I'm impressed.

01:44:55.459 --> 01:44:57.001
Mo just taught me those two lines.

01:44:57.626 --> 01:44:58.709
Of course we should remember

01:44:58.876 --> 01:45:00.376
the poem that criticizes us.

01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:01.543
But, I think,

01:45:02.043 --> 01:45:04.251
we should do something heroic,

01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:06.459
and change the old way of thinking.

01:45:13.709 --> 01:45:14.543
Mo,

01:45:15.084 --> 01:45:18.376
others say I always follow your lead,

01:45:19.168 --> 01:45:20.501
I say, we share the same life.

01:45:21.168 --> 01:45:22.001
Whatever you say,

01:45:22.584 --> 01:45:23.459
I will go with you.

01:45:24.334 --> 01:45:25.209
I will go too.

01:45:27.126 --> 01:45:27.876
Me too.

01:45:29.376 --> 01:45:30.168
Count me in.

01:45:32.626 --> 01:45:33.251
Mo,

01:45:35.126 --> 01:45:37.959
we worked together for three years,

01:45:38.626 --> 01:45:40.501
and you were always more popular than me.

01:45:41.251 --> 01:45:42.084
I know,

01:45:42.918 --> 01:45:44.084
you always looked down on me,

01:45:44.918 --> 01:45:46.293
and I never respected you either.

01:45:47.626 --> 01:45:48.251
Well,

01:45:48.626 --> 01:45:49.834
today I hear you.

01:45:50.959 --> 01:45:51.626
I say

01:45:52.043 --> 01:45:53.084
we all go,

01:45:53.626 --> 01:45:54.668
so we can look after each other.

01:45:55.168 --> 01:45:56.251
Mo, you are right.

01:45:56.751 --> 01:45:57.751
People say

01:45:57.918 --> 01:45:59.001
"whores are heartless."

01:46:00.418 --> 01:46:01.293
So tomorrow,

01:46:01.459 --> 01:46:03.334
let's do something
honorable with our hearts.

01:46:05.418 --> 01:46:06.459
We will all go.

01:46:11.168 --> 01:46:12.668
If they went,

01:46:13.584 --> 01:46:16.043
how would the Japanese treat them?

01:46:19.084 --> 01:46:21.709
Will they tear their clothes?

01:46:24.001 --> 01:46:25.293
Will they beat them?

01:46:27.668 --> 01:46:31.501
What if the Japanese rape them?

01:46:31.793 --> 01:46:32.543
Are you kidding?

01:46:33.543 --> 01:46:34.043
No.

01:46:34.793 --> 01:46:35.793
Have you seen these women?

01:46:36.626 --> 01:46:38.959
Those Japanese don't stand a chance.

01:46:40.668 --> 01:46:43.001
These women... these women are formidable.

01:46:44.334 --> 01:46:46.126
Brave, exquisite,

01:46:47.043 --> 01:46:47.918
skillful.

01:46:48.668 --> 01:46:49.626
They've got character,

01:46:49.793 --> 01:46:51.668
like nobody I've ever met.

01:46:52.459 --> 01:46:53.668
The Japanese?

01:46:54.793 --> 01:46:56.709
They're amateurs, amateurs.

01:46:57.043 --> 01:46:58.043
These women,

01:46:59.084 --> 01:47:00.876
they are professionals.

01:47:02.168 --> 01:47:02.918
Father John,

01:47:04.084 --> 01:47:06.001
what exactly do they do?

01:47:11.293 --> 01:47:12.251
You know... they...

01:47:12.876 --> 01:47:15.501
They love and they hate,
just like all of us.

01:47:15.668 --> 01:47:18.709
Maybe they know more
about it than any of us.

01:47:19.959 --> 01:47:21.959
These women if they came

01:47:22.126 --> 01:47:24.126
face to face with the devil himself,

01:47:24.418 --> 01:47:26.334
he'd be putty in their hands.

01:47:26.584 --> 01:47:28.543
These idiot? These soldiers?

01:47:30.334 --> 01:47:31.459
You think they're scary?

01:47:31.626 --> 01:47:33.084
They're not scary.

01:47:33.501 --> 01:47:35.001
If you think somebody's scary,

01:47:35.251 --> 01:47:36.751
you picture them with their pants around

01:47:36.876 --> 01:47:39.209
their ankles, sitting on
the crapper, alright?

01:47:39.376 --> 01:47:40.334
Picture that.

01:47:41.751 --> 01:47:42.876
Not so scary then.

01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:46.126
These women, and you girls,

01:47:46.668 --> 01:47:51.209
you gotta strength and
beauty that will never die.

01:47:51.709 --> 01:47:53.209
So don't you worry about them.

01:47:54.959 --> 01:47:56.209
Don't worry about them.

01:47:58.043 --> 01:47:58.709
But...

01:47:59.334 --> 01:48:02.793
but they don't look anything like us,

01:48:03.876 --> 01:48:05.043
how can they go?

01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:09.209
That's where my powers come in.

01:48:10.209 --> 01:48:11.709
I don't do much very well.

01:48:12.251 --> 01:48:15.543
But that, that I do well.

01:48:16.376 --> 01:48:18.751
And I'll make them look like your twins.

01:48:20.501 --> 01:48:21.293
You'll see.

01:48:29.001 --> 01:48:29.959
Father John,

01:48:30.626 --> 01:48:31.626
I was wrong,

01:48:32.668 --> 01:48:33.918
I'm sorry.

01:48:34.709 --> 01:48:36.668
Shu, you don't have to be sorry.

01:48:37.918 --> 01:48:39.501
You don't have to be sorry.

01:48:39.793 --> 01:48:41.751
No, I was wrong.

01:48:42.543 --> 01:48:43.334
What is it?

01:48:44.459 --> 01:48:48.126
From the first day she came here,

01:48:48.668 --> 01:48:50.334
I felt uncomfortable.

01:48:52.376 --> 01:48:53.209
I thought

01:48:54.876 --> 01:48:56.084
she was not good.

01:48:56.876 --> 01:48:57.918
I even thought

01:48:58.501 --> 01:49:01.959
both of you were not good.

01:49:02.918 --> 01:49:04.001
That's ok.

01:49:04.168 --> 01:49:05.959
I want to say to her,

01:49:06.543 --> 01:49:07.293
sorry.

01:49:07.834 --> 01:49:09.168
And say to you,

01:49:10.043 --> 01:49:11.251
I'm sorry.

01:49:11.626 --> 01:49:13.376
You don't have to say you're sorry.

01:49:17.834 --> 01:49:19.918
You got nothing to be sorry about.

01:49:37.918 --> 01:49:40.126
I had seen many people pray before,

01:49:40.543 --> 01:49:41.959
but that night, the sight of

01:49:42.418 --> 01:49:43.418
John's back as he prayed

01:49:43.584 --> 01:49:45.626
would stay with me for the rest of my life.

01:49:53.501 --> 01:49:55.876
They brought new uniforms.

01:49:59.668 --> 01:50:01.334
Our old uniforms were torn,

01:50:02.334 --> 01:50:03.251
so I brought you new ones.

01:50:04.334 --> 01:50:05.876
Father Ingleman wanted us

01:50:06.293 --> 01:50:07.501
to wear them for Christmas.

01:50:08.126 --> 01:50:09.418
You don't mind me wearing it?

01:50:09.959 --> 01:50:11.043
The sleeves are short.

01:50:12.001 --> 01:50:13.043
Try it on.

01:50:15.501 --> 01:50:16.168
Big sister.

01:50:22.084 --> 01:50:23.459
I can't button it up for you.

01:50:23.918 --> 01:50:25.626
I'm already skinnier from starvation.

01:50:26.376 --> 01:50:27.501
You are not built like a student,

01:50:27.668 --> 01:50:29.376
more like a student's wet nurse!

01:50:35.876 --> 01:50:37.043
I have an idea,

01:50:37.334 --> 01:50:38.501
to fool the Japanese,

01:50:38.668 --> 01:50:39.584
let's use the curtains

01:50:39.751 --> 01:50:40.876
to make the uniforms fit,

01:50:41.043 --> 01:50:42.043
and tear up the sheets

01:50:42.209 --> 01:50:43.459
to wrap our chests.

01:50:43.626 --> 01:50:45.376
So, our boobs won't pop out.

01:52:09.543 --> 01:52:10.793
What're we doing, George?

01:52:11.376 --> 01:52:12.126
What're we doing?

01:52:12.751 --> 01:52:14.126
Listen, your God teaches,

01:52:14.459 --> 01:52:15.959
everybody's born equal, right?

01:52:16.126 --> 01:52:18.459
So, the women, the girls, which?

01:52:20.418 --> 01:52:21.334
What would you do?

01:52:22.959 --> 01:52:23.793
We must.

01:52:25.293 --> 01:52:26.709
What else we can do?

01:52:34.834 --> 01:52:36.376
He gave me these bracelets

01:52:37.168 --> 01:52:38.126
so I would go with him.

01:52:39.584 --> 01:52:42.876
I didn't trust him enough so I didn't.

01:52:44.251 --> 01:52:46.209
I should have.

01:52:47.876 --> 01:52:48.584
I was so stupid.

01:52:49.126 --> 01:52:50.709
You would be even more stupid

01:52:50.876 --> 01:52:51.709
wearing them to meet the Japs.

01:52:52.043 --> 01:52:52.876
Leave them here.

01:52:53.959 --> 01:52:55.668
Fine, they are yours now.

01:53:00.209 --> 01:53:01.501
When I was your age,

01:53:01.709 --> 01:53:03.543
I had already served countless men.

01:53:04.209 --> 01:53:05.043
Little sister,

01:53:05.751 --> 01:53:07.168
remember to give this back to me.

01:53:07.751 --> 01:53:08.334
I will use the money

01:53:08.501 --> 01:53:09.918
to buy myself out of my contract.

01:53:16.001 --> 01:53:17.584
Big sister, I'm sorry.

01:53:19.834 --> 01:53:21.834
Live a good life for me.

01:53:28.959 --> 01:53:30.834
I don't have any things of value,

01:53:31.293 --> 01:53:32.543
that cat is all I have.

01:53:32.793 --> 01:53:34.376
He ran away the other day.

01:53:34.751 --> 01:53:35.543
Little sister,

01:53:35.834 --> 01:53:36.751
promise me,

01:53:37.126 --> 01:53:38.251
you will find him.

01:53:38.584 --> 01:53:39.084
OK.

01:53:50.001 --> 01:53:51.126
Remember Dou?

01:53:51.751 --> 01:53:52.959
She wasn't much taller than you.

01:53:54.251 --> 01:53:55.459
Please take good care of it.

01:53:56.334 --> 01:53:57.626
This is Dou's life.

01:53:59.334 --> 01:54:01.376
She wanted to play "The Qin Huai View,"

01:54:01.584 --> 01:54:03.084
and for that she was killed.

01:54:06.709 --> 01:54:07.709
The Qin Huai View

01:54:09.168 --> 01:54:10.751
Is that a beautiful song?

01:54:11.043 --> 01:54:13.251
That's our signature song at Jade Paradise.

01:54:15.751 --> 01:54:17.376
Why don't we sing it for Dou?

01:54:17.543 --> 01:54:18.959
It was her dying wish after all.

01:54:19.251 --> 01:54:21.084
Let's sing it for the girls,

01:54:21.334 --> 01:54:22.793
so they remember us at our best!

01:54:31.001 --> 01:54:36.251
"I have a story,"

01:54:36.459 --> 01:54:41.251
"and let me put it into song."

01:54:41.709 --> 01:54:46.668
"I hope every one of you"

01:54:46.834 --> 01:54:51.793
"can listen to me patiently."

01:54:51.959 --> 01:54:54.459
"Allow me"

01:54:54.626 --> 01:55:02.209
"to sing the legend of the Qin Huai River,"

01:55:02.376 --> 01:55:07.293
"slowly and passionately,"

01:55:07.584 --> 01:55:13.668
"for each one of you."

01:55:20.751 --> 01:55:25.793
"Ever since the ancient era,"

01:55:25.959 --> 01:55:30.626
"the river has been flowing gracefully."

01:55:31.168 --> 01:55:36.209
"it is the beauty of the South,"

01:55:36.334 --> 01:55:41.376
"the elegance of Nanking."

01:55:41.543 --> 01:55:43.959
"Walk in the famous Zhan Palace,"

01:55:44.126 --> 01:55:51.834
"enjoy the spectacular architecture."

01:55:52.001 --> 01:55:54.168
"Look at the Colony of Cranes"

01:55:54.418 --> 01:55:56.709
"with water rippling all around."

01:55:57.251 --> 01:56:04.876
"What a paradise this is."

01:56:06.876 --> 01:56:08.251
Mo, would...

01:56:10.501 --> 01:56:11.793
You look so sweet.

01:56:17.209 --> 01:56:19.501
Would you mind... lying down?

01:56:21.584 --> 01:56:23.001
I'm just not used to...

01:56:23.918 --> 01:56:24.959
People who can sit?

01:56:25.126 --> 01:56:26.543
Right, people who can sit.

01:56:28.126 --> 01:56:28.876
Would you mind?

01:56:29.043 --> 01:56:30.459
I understand, I don't mind.

01:56:40.293 --> 01:56:42.459
So madam, what will it be?

01:56:44.709 --> 01:56:46.043
Fourteen years old?

01:56:47.584 --> 01:56:48.834
How about thirteen?

01:56:53.584 --> 01:56:55.751
Until thirteen I was a good girl.

01:56:56.834 --> 01:56:57.543
Very good.

01:56:58.584 --> 01:56:59.584
Thirteen it is.

01:57:01.084 --> 01:57:02.376
So I'll straighten your hair,

01:57:03.418 --> 01:57:04.501
cut it in a bob.

01:57:09.126 --> 01:57:10.168
I have an idea,

01:57:12.168 --> 01:57:13.584
I think it'll be beautiful.

01:57:17.334 --> 01:57:18.459
This is what we need.

01:57:19.834 --> 01:57:20.751
It's perfect.

01:57:35.043 --> 01:57:36.209
The way you are now,

01:57:38.126 --> 01:57:39.543
is what I like the best.

01:57:42.793 --> 01:57:43.668
I see you.

01:57:46.126 --> 01:57:48.459
I see everything that you've been through.

01:57:51.168 --> 01:57:52.793
And I want all of that, Mo.

01:57:54.459 --> 01:57:55.334
I want all of it.

01:57:57.459 --> 01:57:58.126
I love it.

01:57:59.126 --> 01:58:00.001
I love it all.

01:58:03.793 --> 01:58:05.584
Are you going to fall in love with me?

01:58:08.293 --> 01:58:09.418
I already have.

01:58:37.918 --> 01:58:39.168
I can do this.

01:58:42.376 --> 01:58:43.959
Sorry, these are not my clothes.

01:58:51.376 --> 01:58:53.001
I wanna promise you something.

01:58:55.543 --> 01:58:57.001
When this war is over,

01:58:57.793 --> 01:58:58.959
I'm gonna find you,

01:59:02.168 --> 01:59:03.376
and I'm gonna take you home.

01:59:07.209 --> 01:59:07.751
No.

01:59:09.876 --> 01:59:10.834
After tonight,

01:59:12.834 --> 01:59:15.376
my body will no longer be mine.

01:59:21.251 --> 01:59:22.501
Take me home now.

01:59:59.751 --> 02:00:00.834
Wow, Mo!

02:00:01.001 --> 02:00:02.251
He can turn back time.

02:00:02.459 --> 02:00:03.793
He chopped away five or six years!

02:00:04.001 --> 02:00:06.084
Three more chops and we'd all be infants,

02:00:06.251 --> 02:00:08.001
so we can start our lives over again!

02:00:08.168 --> 02:00:09.334
Have you asked him,

02:00:09.501 --> 02:00:11.043
where he learned such skills?

02:00:11.793 --> 02:00:12.418
Mo,

02:00:12.584 --> 02:00:14.251
ask him to cut our hair too.

02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:17.959
They all want you to give them a makeover.

02:00:19.126 --> 02:00:20.084
My pleasure.

02:00:20.959 --> 02:00:22.626
Glad to serve you.

02:00:32.126 --> 02:00:32.709
Here.

02:00:33.084 --> 02:00:34.418
He has to work with you lying down.

02:00:35.918 --> 02:00:38.209
Right, he's a mortician,

02:00:38.376 --> 02:00:39.834
he only knows how to work on dead people.

02:00:40.126 --> 02:00:40.918
Are they disturbed...

02:00:42.501 --> 02:00:43.293
by the way I work?

02:00:43.501 --> 02:00:44.168
Sorry.

02:00:45.793 --> 02:00:47.126
He hopes you won't mind.

02:00:48.334 --> 02:00:50.001
Whatever, who cares?

02:00:50.168 --> 02:00:52.501
I just want to look like
a pretty schoolgirl.

02:00:53.126 --> 02:00:54.209
Give me a coat.

02:01:06.626 --> 02:01:08.168
His hands are so soft.

02:01:08.418 --> 02:01:10.168
Mo, did he really work on the dead?

02:01:10.918 --> 02:01:12.543
Mo, we're going to sleep.

02:01:12.668 --> 02:01:14.168
Wake us up when it's our turn.

02:01:27.459 --> 02:01:29.043
You've done this your whole life?

02:01:30.209 --> 02:01:31.126
For five years.

02:01:31.876 --> 02:01:33.251
You do this very well.

02:01:38.584 --> 02:01:39.376
It matters.

02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:41.876
It matters to me.

02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:46.001
Before my daughter died,

02:01:49.876 --> 02:01:51.084
she made me promise

02:01:52.543 --> 02:01:53.918
to make her beautiful again.

02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:57.959
That was the first time.

02:02:00.751 --> 02:02:01.584
It's important.

02:02:04.584 --> 02:02:05.584
It's important work.

02:02:07.251 --> 02:02:08.084
I'm sorry.

02:02:10.376 --> 02:02:11.751
She would have been twelve.

02:02:14.793 --> 02:02:15.709
Like the girls.

02:02:17.084 --> 02:02:17.584
Yeah.

02:02:47.626 --> 02:02:49.501
Mo, he's amazing!

02:02:51.209 --> 02:02:52.418
If only my mother were alive,

02:02:52.584 --> 02:02:53.793
she would have been so happy

02:02:54.043 --> 02:02:55.709
to see me like this.

02:02:56.126 --> 02:02:56.959
She said,

02:02:57.584 --> 02:02:59.668
we never had a scholar in our family.

02:03:03.084 --> 02:03:05.293
Now you are a scholar, so am I.

02:03:05.459 --> 02:03:07.334
My mother wouldn't recognize me either!

02:03:07.501 --> 02:03:08.126
Of course not.

02:03:08.293 --> 02:03:09.126
We are now students.

02:03:09.293 --> 02:03:11.126
Let's line up.

02:03:11.959 --> 02:03:14.001
Mo, let him see if we
all look like students.

02:03:20.293 --> 02:03:21.793
No need to count, we only have twelve.

02:03:23.668 --> 02:03:24.668
We are one short.

02:03:28.001 --> 02:03:29.584
How many did the Japanese say?

02:03:32.543 --> 02:03:33.293
How many?

02:03:35.584 --> 02:03:36.376
Thirteen.

02:03:36.668 --> 02:03:37.376
How many?

02:03:37.751 --> 02:03:40.668
Thirteen. We only have twelve here.

02:03:42.584 --> 02:03:43.459
This is a terrible joke.

02:03:45.334 --> 02:03:47.126
One of the students still has to go!

02:03:47.334 --> 02:03:48.251
We did all of this for nothing!

02:03:53.793 --> 02:03:54.626
I will go.

02:03:57.126 --> 02:03:58.168
What did he say?

02:03:58.501 --> 02:03:59.334
I will go.

02:03:59.834 --> 02:04:00.501
George.

02:04:01.209 --> 02:04:02.376
He said he would go.

02:04:02.751 --> 02:04:04.001
What are you talking about?

02:04:05.543 --> 02:04:06.418
You are a boy!

02:04:12.043 --> 02:04:15.876
Father Ingleman ask me to protect students.

02:04:16.334 --> 02:04:17.751
But I'm not good.

02:04:18.084 --> 02:04:19.584
I'm... I'm terrible.

02:04:20.209 --> 02:04:21.293
I'm... I'm bad.

02:04:21.543 --> 02:04:23.376
Who cares if we are one short?

02:04:23.543 --> 02:04:24.376
We will just say that

02:04:24.543 --> 02:04:25.876
one of us has died from an illness.

02:04:26.043 --> 02:04:27.168
My grandma told me that

02:04:27.334 --> 02:04:28.668
the Japanese can't count.

02:04:29.209 --> 02:04:30.043
We can't do that!

02:04:30.209 --> 02:04:31.751
The Japanese are very astute!

02:04:32.043 --> 02:04:33.376
They will search everywhere,

02:04:33.543 --> 02:04:35.459
and it will be the end for the students!

02:04:35.626 --> 02:04:36.584
There is nothing you can do.

02:04:36.751 --> 02:04:38.293
They will see that you are a boy.

02:04:38.459 --> 02:04:39.876
You can't fool them.

02:04:40.209 --> 02:04:42.084
Yes, it's too obvious.

02:04:42.293 --> 02:04:43.209
It's a short distance

02:04:43.376 --> 02:04:44.293
from the church to the car.

02:04:44.459 --> 02:04:45.293
If I am made-up as a girl,

02:04:45.459 --> 02:04:46.459
lower my head,

02:04:46.626 --> 02:04:48.834
and walk right behind you all,

02:04:49.001 --> 02:04:50.751
I'm sure the Japanese won't notice!

02:04:52.084 --> 02:04:53.251
If we have one missing,

02:04:53.709 --> 02:04:55.084
the Japanese will find out,

02:04:55.376 --> 02:04:57.334
then... a big trouble.

02:04:57.793 --> 02:05:00.168
You are good at make-up.

02:05:00.334 --> 02:05:01.501
You can do for me.

02:05:01.668 --> 02:05:03.501
George, I'm not that good.

02:05:03.668 --> 02:05:05.793
No, you can.

02:05:06.043 --> 02:05:07.376
George, stop it.

02:05:07.543 --> 02:05:08.709
- It can't work.
- You can!

02:05:11.251 --> 02:05:13.001
The church to the car

02:05:13.168 --> 02:05:14.418
just a short way!

02:05:14.918 --> 02:05:15.959
You are good at make-up,

02:05:16.126 --> 02:05:17.334
you can do for me!

02:05:18.293 --> 02:05:19.751
I will lower my head!

02:05:20.834 --> 02:05:23.793
It's possible, it just a short way!

02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:28.501
You can.

02:05:29.168 --> 02:05:29.876
It's possible.

02:06:38.126 --> 02:06:40.376
You know what could happen?

02:06:41.209 --> 02:06:42.834
Yes, yes, I know.

02:06:44.168 --> 02:06:47.334
I can do what Father Ingleman tell me.

02:06:49.668 --> 02:06:50.376
Amazing.

02:06:52.043 --> 02:06:53.168
I think I hear

02:06:53.334 --> 02:06:55.293
what the Father is saying right now.

02:06:55.751 --> 02:06:56.334
Yes?

02:06:56.709 --> 02:06:57.251
Yeah.

02:06:58.043 --> 02:06:59.209
What he saying?

02:06:59.584 --> 02:07:00.626
I think he's saying...

02:07:02.334 --> 02:07:03.751
that you've done an incredible...

02:07:04.668 --> 02:07:08.376
an incredible job, taking
care of the girls.

02:07:08.876 --> 02:07:11.001
And that you're good, so good.

02:07:13.709 --> 02:07:16.084
And I think he's also asking...

02:07:18.043 --> 02:07:20.334
what the hell are you doing...

02:07:20.501 --> 02:07:22.918
with that awful wig on your head?

02:07:44.626 --> 02:07:47.084
This was the last time I saw George Chen.

02:07:47.584 --> 02:07:50.043
When he was six years old,

02:07:50.501 --> 02:07:51.834
and almost died of starvation,

02:07:52.126 --> 02:07:53.584
Father Ingleman saved him.

02:07:54.209 --> 02:07:56.334
He rang the church bell, swept the floor,

02:07:56.584 --> 02:07:58.001
and worked in the kitchen.

02:07:58.418 --> 02:07:59.418
We used to laugh at him,

02:07:59.668 --> 02:08:02.334
whenever he spoke in English

02:08:02.501 --> 02:08:03.751
or in Nanking dialect.

02:08:16.459 --> 02:08:17.834
You know that,

02:08:18.709 --> 02:08:20.168
you can't really go there.

02:08:20.876 --> 02:08:23.751
You gotta escape somehow
before you get there.

02:08:24.293 --> 02:08:27.834
You gotta jump from the car
or the truck or whatever.

02:08:28.501 --> 02:08:29.793
You wait until it slows down,

02:08:29.959 --> 02:08:31.001
goes around the corner,

02:08:31.168 --> 02:08:32.168
that's when you jump.

02:08:32.584 --> 02:08:34.293
No, I'm no jumping.

02:08:34.668 --> 02:08:35.459
Don't teach me.

02:08:35.626 --> 02:08:36.293
Why not?

02:08:36.918 --> 02:08:37.834
If I jump,

02:08:39.293 --> 02:08:41.168
Japanese will find out.

02:08:42.001 --> 02:08:43.209
I will go all the way,

02:08:43.793 --> 02:08:47.626
give you more time. You and the girls

02:08:48.793 --> 02:08:50.376
get out of the church.

02:09:05.918 --> 02:09:06.751
Hide your weapons well.

02:09:06.918 --> 02:09:07.709
Don't let the Japanese see.

02:09:08.126 --> 02:09:08.668
Don't worry,

02:09:08.876 --> 02:09:10.543
at least we will get an eyeball.

02:09:21.209 --> 02:09:22.668
Have you got something as well?

02:09:59.043 --> 02:10:01.501
Following our commander's order,

02:10:01.751 --> 02:10:03.459
I'm here to pick up the students.

02:10:07.293 --> 02:10:09.084
Here is a gift bag from our troops.

02:10:10.084 --> 02:10:11.209
Please accept it.

02:10:35.043 --> 02:10:36.126
What are you doing here?

02:10:37.251 --> 02:10:38.043
Mr. Kato.

02:10:39.293 --> 02:10:42.501
Have you spoken with Colonel Hasegawa?

02:10:43.043 --> 02:10:44.168
My daughter,

02:10:44.418 --> 02:10:47.251
she doesn't have to go, right?

02:10:48.001 --> 02:10:49.418
The order is from the chief commander.

02:10:49.876 --> 02:10:51.834
Even Colonel Hasegawa can't interfere.

02:10:52.376 --> 02:10:53.251
Get out.

02:10:53.959 --> 02:10:54.668
Mr. Kato.

02:10:55.126 --> 02:10:56.584
But you promised to help.

02:10:56.751 --> 02:10:57.418
Shut up!

02:10:59.251 --> 02:11:01.126
The chief commander is in charge.

02:11:01.459 --> 02:11:02.001
Look,

02:11:02.834 --> 02:11:04.126
he sent troops just for this.

02:11:04.709 --> 02:11:06.251
We can't do anything.

02:11:07.793 --> 02:11:09.334
But we had a deal.

02:11:10.209 --> 02:11:13.459
I have given you all of my valuables.

02:11:13.834 --> 02:11:14.501
Mr. Kato.

02:11:14.876 --> 02:11:16.626
Please, you promised!

02:11:16.793 --> 02:11:18.793
When did I take your things?

02:11:23.293 --> 02:11:25.959
That was for our military expenses.

02:11:30.626 --> 02:11:31.709
Then I'm begging you,

02:11:32.293 --> 02:11:33.793
please allow me to see

02:11:34.293 --> 02:11:35.959
my daughter one last time.

02:13:18.293 --> 02:13:20.918
I'm not a student. I won't go!

02:13:21.084 --> 02:13:23.001
I won't go!

02:13:23.376 --> 02:13:24.793
I'm not a student!

02:13:26.918 --> 02:13:28.251
Isn't that your daughter?

02:13:28.418 --> 02:13:29.251
What is she saying?

02:13:29.751 --> 02:13:30.834
Why is she shouting?

02:13:31.543 --> 02:13:35.543
I'm not a student!

02:13:40.209 --> 02:13:42.793
I won't go!

02:13:50.751 --> 02:13:52.543
Be gentle with her, she's just a girl.

02:14:07.084 --> 02:14:08.626
You've seen your daughter.

02:14:59.668 --> 02:15:00.168
Let's go.

02:15:00.501 --> 02:15:01.168
Come on.

02:15:19.918 --> 02:15:20.543
Shu.

02:15:21.876 --> 02:15:22.626
Come here.

02:15:25.293 --> 02:15:27.834
Your father is a good man.

02:15:28.043 --> 02:15:28.876
We could never have done this...

02:15:29.043 --> 02:15:30.043
without your father.

02:15:30.459 --> 02:15:31.418
He's a good man.

02:15:37.959 --> 02:15:38.918
Watch your legs.

02:17:25.709 --> 02:17:26.626
John told me that his biggest regret

02:17:27.293 --> 02:17:27.918
was that, because

02:17:28.084 --> 02:17:29.959
we had to get out as quickly as possible,

02:17:30.376 --> 02:17:32.334
he couldn't give my father a proper burial.

02:18:02.126 --> 02:18:05.543
Is this good for me to go through?

02:18:08.834 --> 02:18:09.793
What's on the truck?

02:18:14.543 --> 02:18:16.126
Empty wine cases, but...

02:18:16.709 --> 02:18:18.293
four of them are full. They are...

02:18:18.459 --> 02:18:20.126
very good, very good.

02:18:20.293 --> 02:18:20.876
Here.

02:18:21.709 --> 02:18:23.001
You see, vintage.

02:18:24.543 --> 02:18:25.501
If you would like some.

02:18:27.001 --> 02:18:27.751
Open it.

02:18:33.626 --> 02:18:34.293
These.

02:18:35.709 --> 02:18:36.209
Take.

02:19:18.251 --> 02:19:19.543
Until this day

02:19:19.751 --> 02:19:21.668
I still don't know what happened

02:19:21.834 --> 02:19:23.043
to the women of the Qin Huai River.

02:19:23.626 --> 02:19:25.918
I never learned all of their names,

02:19:26.751 --> 02:19:28.043
and never saw them

02:19:28.209 --> 02:19:29.709
being taken away by the Japanese.

02:19:30.084 --> 02:19:31.876
So, I always imagine...

02:19:32.418 --> 02:19:33.251
I imagine myself standing

02:19:33.418 --> 02:19:34.834
by the large round window,

02:19:35.209 --> 02:19:36.626
watching them walk in once again.
