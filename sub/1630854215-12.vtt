WEBVTT

00:02.837 --> 00:03.713
Good morning.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.173
Not so much.

00:06.173 --> 00:09.260
- Sorry. I hate when repair guys are late.
- He wasn't late.

00:09.260 --> 00:12.263
He realized that
my isolated termite presence

00:12.263 --> 00:15.891
is actually more of a complete
and total termite infestation.

00:15.891 --> 00:17.435
I have to tent my house.

00:17.435 --> 00:19.812
No. You had to pack up
your clothes and food.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.564
Vikane gas doesn't affect clothes,

00:21.564 --> 00:25.151
but you should definitely throw out
all your food when you go home.

00:25.151 --> 00:26.610
Already did.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.237
Where are you going to stay?

00:30.406 --> 00:32.408
Stay in our guest room.

00:34.410 --> 00:35.911
I'll stay at a hotel.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.913
But you hate sleeping in hotels.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.874
I hate intruding on my friends,

00:39.874 --> 00:43.502
and I hate intruding on my friend's
pregnant wives even more.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.796
It's not an intrusion. Stay with us.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.840
I'm okay. Thank you.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.426
- We want to.
- Absolutely. We insist.

00:55.264 --> 00:56.098
Okay.

00:57.224 --> 00:58.225
Thank you.

01:00.102 --> 01:01.103
It's delicious.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.564
- It's disgusting.
- And it helps me poop.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.316
I do not need to know that.

01:05.316 --> 01:07.693
As a doctor,
you know what prune juice does--

01:07.693 --> 01:09.653
Shut up, I'm trying to eat.

01:11.447 --> 01:13.574
Coffee <i>and</i> a Red Bull.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.952
You prepping for a post-breakfast
MMA match there, big guy?

01:16.952 --> 01:18.871
I was up late, need a boost.

01:20.122 --> 01:23.542
I was catching up on some journals,
and I've already been to a meeting.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.503
Check my sign-off sheet if you want.

01:25.503 --> 01:28.088
- I didn't say anything.
- You don't need to.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.926
Wolke and Perez, you're with me.

01:31.926 --> 01:33.469
We were scheduled with Park.

01:33.469 --> 01:36.472
I just fired one resident,
and you two are on probation.

01:37.807 --> 01:40.351
Not exactly my vision for the department.

01:40.351 --> 01:43.062
It's time for me to
take a hands-on approach,

01:43.062 --> 01:45.981
see how your surgical educations
are progressing.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.983
We round in five, don't be late.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.948
I want to do another embryo transfer ASAP.

01:53.948 --> 01:55.324
Three months is ASAP.

01:55.324 --> 01:58.577
Not if we restart my hormone injections,
add methylprednisolone,

01:58.577 --> 02:00.663
and do prophylactic
endometrial scratching.

02:00.663 --> 02:03.082
Aggressive uterine prep
means more side effects.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.167
I can handle it.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.838
Morgan, I understand your impatience,

02:08.838 --> 02:11.340
but an unsuccessful embryo transfer is--

02:11.340 --> 02:13.342
I wanna do whatever it takes.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.929
Now. Not in three months.

02:19.056 --> 02:19.890
Okay.

02:20.558 --> 02:23.769
We'll start the hormones
and the methylprednisolone today.

02:25.396 --> 02:26.897
I have a new idea.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.066
The echo results were that bad?

02:30.484 --> 02:33.195
Your heart muscle's
deteriorating way too fast.

02:33.195 --> 02:35.781
We don't have time to wait
for a matching donor.

02:35.781 --> 02:37.324
We'll fix the one you have.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.410
We're going to remove the scar tissue,

02:39.410 --> 02:41.871
and use a synthetic patch
with healthy tissue

02:41.871 --> 02:44.415
to reshape your ventricle over a balloon.

02:44.415 --> 02:46.292
It's kind of like paper maché.

02:46.292 --> 02:49.753
If that's possible,
why didn't we do it sooner?

02:50.838 --> 02:52.631
It's a challenging technique...

02:52.631 --> 02:55.050
Which makes it
right in Dr. Lim's wheelhouse.

02:55.050 --> 02:58.929
But I'm confident it's the best option
for your situation.

03:02.141 --> 03:05.227
This surgery is amazing.
How did you come up with it?

03:05.227 --> 03:07.813
I didn't. It's a modified Dor Procedure,

03:07.813 --> 03:10.441
basically, an endoventricular
patch plasty.

03:10.441 --> 03:13.152
There is nothing basic about it.
I'm excited.

03:13.152 --> 03:14.528
- Spare me.
- What?

03:14.528 --> 03:17.990
Stroking my ego isn't going to
get you off of probation.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.200
I am not stroking your ego,
I am sincerely--

03:20.200 --> 03:24.079
Start with a DE-MRI
to map the scar versus functional tissue,

03:24.079 --> 03:26.290
while I finalize the surgical plan.

03:27.082 --> 03:29.752
Dr. Perez, what do I need from this MRI?

03:31.086 --> 03:34.381
Completely pristine images
of right ventricular scarring

03:34.381 --> 03:36.300
without artifact or distortion.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.553
No room for error on this.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.195
There's a small mass.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.656
Her pediatrician said it was a cyst.

03:58.656 --> 04:02.660
He doesn't think she needs surgery,
but suggested we get a consult.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.745
She definitely needs surgery.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.041
It's a minor outpatient procedure.

04:09.041 --> 04:12.461
She's only 13, with no previous symptoms.
It's most likely benign.

04:12.461 --> 04:15.673
We will need to do a needle biopsy,
and CT to confirm.

04:15.673 --> 04:19.009
- What's a needle biopsy?
- It's kind of like a shot.

04:19.593 --> 04:20.719
In my belly?

04:21.512 --> 04:24.264
Honey, it's okay. You'll be fine.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.265
Mom, no.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.727
Can you do it while she's asleep?

04:28.727 --> 04:33.065
General anesthesia would add
unnecessary risk to a needle biopsy.

04:33.065 --> 04:35.442
Please, I can't do this.

04:36.860 --> 04:40.823
Kelli, We're gonna numb you
and you'll close your eyes,

04:40.823 --> 04:43.534
hold your mom's hand and count to ten.

04:43.534 --> 04:45.369
And then it'll all be over.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.125
Do you promise?

04:51.750 --> 04:52.710
Absolutely.

05:01.010 --> 05:02.219
This is not good.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.680
Looks good to me.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.100
Any end systolic volume less than 200
is within parameters.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.227
I mean, Lim's idea for Bob's surgery.

05:10.227 --> 05:11.812
You said it was amazing.

05:11.812 --> 05:14.356
That's before I did research
to understand it.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.983
It's way too risky.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.652
You're mad 'cause she called you out
for brown-nosing.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.903
I was sincerely psyched.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.114
- After reading one article--
- I read five.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.951
Right-sided failure has resulted
in negative outcomes

05:25.951 --> 05:27.536
in every case I've reviewed.

05:30.247 --> 05:34.168
Lim's been treating this guy for years,
knows the case way better.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.964
She knows the patient better,
which could impact her objectivity.

05:39.715 --> 05:42.384
You want to question
the chief surgeon's objectivity?

05:42.384 --> 05:45.012
No, I want to suggest
she reconsider her strategy.

05:45.554 --> 05:46.388
I wouldn't.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.392
Why? Because you're scared of her?

05:50.893 --> 05:53.187
Yes. And you should be, too.

05:53.187 --> 05:56.356
My OD and you and Powell going rogue.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.775
I'd rather not add to...

06:08.118 --> 06:10.704
Can you show Mr. Zegras
how to apply the eye drops?

06:10.704 --> 06:11.830
Sure, no problem.

06:12.456 --> 06:13.665
I don't know.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.835
I don't know. I will keep this for you.

06:18.962 --> 06:19.963
Watch out.

06:21.840 --> 06:22.966
Okay.

06:24.843 --> 06:25.803
Hey.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.807
I just closed a deal

06:29.807 --> 06:32.351
with one of the biggest CRO's
on the West Coast.

06:32.351 --> 06:35.604
They will consolidate
all their clinical trials here.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.023
That's awesome.

06:38.899 --> 06:41.693
Are you telling me because
you plan to close the clinic

06:41.693 --> 06:43.195
to make room for the CRO?

06:43.195 --> 06:44.446
I have the space.

06:45.197 --> 06:48.992
But what I don't have is a smart,
aggressive, ambitious physician

06:48.992 --> 06:51.578
to manage the partnership and serve as PI.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.747
You interested?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.750
- I'm flattered.
- It'll be a ton of work,

06:56.750 --> 06:59.253
but a <i>great</i> opportunity
for St. Bon's and yourself.

06:59.253 --> 07:00.462
I agree.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.465
It's just a bit unexpected.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.883
Can I think about it?

07:07.177 --> 07:08.303
Of course.

07:08.303 --> 07:11.223
Take some time, but not too much.

07:11.223 --> 07:12.933
I need an answer by Friday.

07:25.154 --> 07:27.531
There's almost no viable cardiac tissue.

07:27.531 --> 07:30.117
And poor contractions
in what little there is.

07:30.117 --> 07:34.204
There's still an area of tissue left
that could be viable after CABG.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.664
We can't start surgery,

07:35.664 --> 07:38.458
hoping there's enough tissue
to reshape the ventricle.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.460
That's a risk to this approach.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.421
If you have another idea...

07:42.421 --> 07:44.923
A BiVAD, with an unmatched donor heart.

07:44.923 --> 07:45.841
Ruled it out.

07:45.841 --> 07:48.760
He'd reject an unmatched heart
in less than a year.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.221
Beats dying on the table
in less than 24 hours.

07:52.598 --> 07:55.434
I appreciate your opinion,
not a huge fan of the tone.

07:56.018 --> 07:56.852
Sorry.

07:57.519 --> 08:00.731
If we put Bob
on longer-term anti-rejection meds,

08:00.731 --> 08:03.317
that would buy more time
for the unmatched heart.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.820
During which time he'd be
completely vulnerable to infection.

08:08.197 --> 08:09.865
I know SVR is high risk,

08:09.865 --> 08:13.035
but given Bob's condition,
I'm convinced it's the only solution

08:13.035 --> 08:16.121
to keep him alive long enough
to find a matching donor heart.

08:16.747 --> 08:20.042
I plan to spend some time
rehearsing every surgical step,

08:20.042 --> 08:22.127
I'd suggest you two do the same.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.720
Why did you say yes?

08:31.720 --> 08:33.430
It was one of those moments

08:33.430 --> 08:37.351
when you say the thing
a polite person is supposed to say,

08:37.351 --> 08:40.395
even as you're realizing
you don't mean it at all.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.398
Okay. It'll be fine.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.234
You'll be at work all day,

08:45.234 --> 08:47.361
and at night he'll sit in a corner

08:47.361 --> 08:49.446
and read a presidential biography.

08:50.239 --> 08:52.991
That's... oddly specific.

08:52.991 --> 08:55.202
Old dudes love reading about presidents.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.788
They fantasize having done it all better.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.004
What's wrong?

09:07.422 --> 09:08.548
It's not a cyst.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.802
It's an invasive hydatidiform mole.

09:11.802 --> 09:12.970
Interesting.

09:14.012 --> 09:18.392
That type of tumor could only occur
from a mutated fertilized egg.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.228
She has had sex.

09:22.521 --> 09:24.147
She's only 13,

09:24.147 --> 09:28.193
which means even if she consented,
it's statutory rape.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.870
There's a new problem. Actually two.

09:38.870 --> 09:42.082
This type of tumor is caused
by a mutation in a fertilized egg,

09:42.082 --> 09:44.376
meaning, the surgery will be
more difficult.

09:44.376 --> 09:47.421
It also means your daughter
has had sexual intercourse.

09:47.421 --> 09:48.922
Wait, but...

09:48.922 --> 09:51.842
I'm on birth control, and we use condoms.

09:51.842 --> 09:54.261
- How could I be pregnant?
- You're not pregnant.

09:54.261 --> 09:57.764
The implanted egg mutated
into a tumor instead of a fetus,

09:57.764 --> 10:01.184
and no birth control is 100% effective.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.020
But you can still remove it, right?

10:03.020 --> 10:04.271
Yes.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.900
You don't seem surprised to learn
your daughter's had sex.

10:09.693 --> 10:10.902
I'm not learning it.

10:10.902 --> 10:14.114
She's been going steady with Ryan
for over a year.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.365
He's in her grade.

10:16.992 --> 10:17.826
He's sweet.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.620
A 13-year-old child
should not be having sex.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.623
I'm not a child,
and me and Ryan love each other.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.084
If I want to have sex, it's my decision.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.294
You okay with this?

10:27.294 --> 10:30.130
Teenagers will do it,
no matter what their parents say.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.799
So instead of forcing her to sneak around,

10:32.799 --> 10:36.428
I chose to talk to her
about safe sex, birth control,

10:36.428 --> 10:39.181
and help her have a positive experience.

10:39.181 --> 10:40.599
Your daughter is--

10:40.599 --> 10:43.185
Scheduled for surgery tomorrow morning.

10:47.689 --> 10:50.609
And as I deflate the balloon...

10:50.609 --> 10:52.277
I'll remove the final clamps.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.075
That was awesome.

10:58.075 --> 11:02.120
Still not sure it's gonna work.
But it'll definitely be exciting.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.623
Keep the pessimism to yourself this time.

11:04.623 --> 11:08.251
- I'm not a pessimist. I'm a realist.
- Who's on probation.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.252
I know.

11:09.836 --> 11:10.921
Lim's a grown up.

11:10.921 --> 11:12.964
She wants her ideas to be challenged.

11:12.964 --> 11:14.549
It's part of our job to do it.

11:14.549 --> 11:18.595
In recovery, we talk a lot
about the value of humility.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.347
Lim's not a higher power.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.682
You're confusing humility with weakness.

11:27.312 --> 11:28.605
It's Lim.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.565
But feel free to ignore it.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.609
Show her what a badass you are.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.744
Hey. I haven't seen you all day.

11:42.744 --> 11:43.912
I took it off.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.290
Lim's covering my residents,
and Kellan's in town.

11:47.290 --> 11:50.669
We're going to see Young the Giant.
I'd left these in my desk.

11:50.669 --> 11:51.753
That'll be fun.

11:52.295 --> 11:55.215
Fun for me.
I think he'd rather be with friends.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.551
Although, he enjoys
the free tickets and beer.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.137
Oh, God, he can drink now?

12:00.137 --> 12:04.516
I'm sure he's been drinking for a while,
but legally for a month now.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.352
Time flies.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.521
Faster than you'd ever imagine.

12:11.815 --> 12:12.899
Have a good night.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.153
Park.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.826
Andrews closed a partnership deal
with a big CRO.

12:22.826 --> 12:25.412
He wants me to manage it and serve as PI.

12:26.997 --> 12:28.206
Congrats.

12:28.206 --> 12:31.918
It is a great opportunity,
exactly what I've been looking for.

12:32.544 --> 12:35.380
But it's going to mean
a lot more time at work,

12:35.380 --> 12:38.008
and I'm hoping to be a mother soon.

12:40.510 --> 12:44.473
My favorite memories are all school plays,

12:44.473 --> 12:46.725
baseball games, camping trips.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.311
And my biggest regret

12:49.311 --> 12:52.147
is that I missed way too many
of those moments.

12:53.899 --> 12:54.941
Sorry.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.444
I wouldn't ask if I don't want
to hear your answer.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.488
You have a great job.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.948
Maybe not the opportunity of a lifetime,

13:01.948 --> 13:05.619
but you can have a set schedule
with reasonable hours.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.747
Seems you already
have the best of both worlds.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.416
Thanks.

13:12.667 --> 13:15.337
- Tell Kellan I said hi.
- Will do.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.638
Kelli is prepped for tomorrow morning.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.349
Good. We are going home.

13:27.349 --> 13:31.144
A 13-year-old can't consent to sex,
and we're obligated to report it.

13:32.187 --> 13:35.315
You want to call the cops
'cause she had sex with her boyfriend?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.942
No, Child Protective Services.

13:37.526 --> 13:41.571
Just because her mom says it's okay,
doesn't negate that it's statutory rape.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.156
If two 13-year-olds have sex,

13:43.156 --> 13:45.951
which one's the rapist,
and which one's the victim?

13:45.951 --> 13:47.327
They're both victims.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.539
Only if they're both rapists,
which doesn't make sense.

13:50.539 --> 13:52.374
The terminology is not the issue.

13:52.374 --> 13:54.960
She's in 7th grade,
sleeps with a teddy bear.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.587
Her mother should be
required to talk to a counselor.

13:57.587 --> 14:01.007
You think that would help,
or create an even bigger mess?

14:01.007 --> 14:01.925
Not our call.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.928
- We have a duty to--
- No, we don't.

14:05.720 --> 14:09.057
Our patient is post-pubescent,
Tanner stage 4.

14:09.057 --> 14:12.143
She can make her own decisions
regarding sexual activity

14:12.143 --> 14:14.104
as long as the partner of similar age.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.481
Just 'cause her body has matured
doesn't mean--

14:16.481 --> 14:18.900
I am the attending
and that is my decision.

14:18.900 --> 14:19.818
That's true,

14:19.818 --> 14:22.612
but maybe you should
discuss it a bit more.

14:22.612 --> 14:23.905
The law is clear.

14:23.905 --> 14:26.241
There is nothing more to discuss.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.340
That smells amazing.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.969
I am going to change.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.848
My mother's marinara.
Usually, there's roasted garlic in here,

14:49.848 --> 14:52.767
but I was told you have
certain food sensitivities.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.937
- Did he say sensitivity or--
- Explosive diarrhea?

14:56.813 --> 14:59.649
- I'm gonna wring his neck.
- As you should. Taste.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.363
- Oh, my God.
- Right?

15:05.363 --> 15:06.990
That is fantastic.

15:06.990 --> 15:10.869
It's better with the roasted garlic,
but, your house, your rules.

15:14.331 --> 15:15.915
Now I see where he learned it.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.543
Shaun cooks just like you,
pre-measures everything

15:18.543 --> 15:20.920
and arranges the bowls
in the order they go in.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.797
Surgeons, we know how to get it done.

15:27.010 --> 15:30.221
Not to mention your fondness
for extra-clean utensils.

15:30.221 --> 15:32.349
No such thing as extra clean.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.808
No, but I cleaned it.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.310
You rinsed it.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.939
I'll sauté some vegetables,
should be ready in 11 minutes.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.941
Okay. I'll get changed.

15:49.699 --> 15:53.495
There, the septal leaflet
of the tricuspid. Play it again.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.291
He's got severe regurg.

15:59.125 --> 16:00.877
We'll need to add a valve repair

16:00.877 --> 16:03.630
to the CABG
and ventricular reconstruction.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.925
- He's not strong enough.
- We don't have a choice.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.594
Need to figure how to do it
all in one procedure.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.846
We could do the BiVAD
with an unmatched donor.

16:11.846 --> 16:12.764
- No.
- It's--

16:12.764 --> 16:14.641
The same idea I said no to before.

16:17.852 --> 16:19.729
So, what do you want us to do?

16:19.729 --> 16:20.772
Nothing.

16:21.523 --> 16:24.275
- I need to think this through on my own.
- We can help you.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.528
I need to figure out
the best surgical plan.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.739
What about implanting an impella first
to decrease afterload?

16:29.739 --> 16:31.741
And increase his odds of stroking out?

16:34.786 --> 16:36.538
Sorry. Go home, get rest.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.249
This is my problem. I'll figure it out.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.351
Lim's under a lot of pressure.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.896
I'm fine.

17:01.896 --> 17:02.856
Just tired.

17:04.649 --> 17:05.692
See you tomorrow.

17:20.957 --> 17:24.836
<i>Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic voice message system.</i>

17:25.920 --> 17:28.173
Hey, Quinn, it's Danny.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.551
Could you give me a call?

17:32.177 --> 17:34.429
I'm not up for another meeting,

17:34.429 --> 17:37.432
but... I'm feeling like...

17:40.518 --> 17:42.437
I really should talk to someone.

17:43.897 --> 17:44.773
Thanks.

18:12.175 --> 18:15.470
I was about to take a shower.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.431
Unless you would like to go first.

18:19.390 --> 18:22.227
Thanks, but you can go ahead.
I'm gonna make some coffee.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.356
Dr. Glassman already made coffee.

18:26.356 --> 18:29.818
He also bought croissants for us
before he left for work.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.111
Wow.

18:34.197 --> 18:36.991
With breakfast and coffee already made,

18:36.991 --> 18:40.370
we now have time to take
an extra-long shower.

18:40.995 --> 18:41.996
Together.

18:43.832 --> 18:46.459
Yes. We do have time for that.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.886
A new ventricle and a new valve?

18:56.886 --> 18:59.222
Repaired ventricle and replaced valve.

19:01.391 --> 19:05.353
This is really my... only option?

19:06.354 --> 19:09.023
There are mechanical heart devices--

19:09.023 --> 19:11.276
That I've already considered.

19:11.276 --> 19:14.612
With heart failure advanced as yours,
it's not a better option.

19:18.575 --> 19:19.492
Okay.

19:20.702 --> 19:22.871
Okay, whatever you think is best.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.207
We're gonna take good care of you.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.377
I know. Thank you.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.806
Get the new valve prepped.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.148
Good morning.

19:51.274 --> 19:54.986
When you start your morning
with shower sex and croissants,

19:54.986 --> 19:56.321
it definitely is.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.488
Lucky you.

19:58.531 --> 20:01.117
Would you be okay if your son
was having shower sex

20:01.117 --> 20:02.869
and croissants in middle school?

20:04.621 --> 20:06.539
I'm still contemplating nursery colors,

20:06.539 --> 20:08.541
so, not ready to think about all that.

20:08.541 --> 20:12.211
But... maybe her mom has a point.

20:13.129 --> 20:16.049
I spent high school sneaking around
my parents' backs.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.343
That's not what I want with my kid.

20:18.343 --> 20:21.137
We're talking about kids. Early teens.

20:23.723 --> 20:27.060
I was 18 when I lost my virginity.
Leon Maxwell.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.271
We'd been together for a year,
I was sure I was ready.

20:30.271 --> 20:33.274
And... how was it?

20:34.400 --> 20:35.401
Fine.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.905
Fun... after we figured some things out.

20:38.905 --> 20:42.075
But starting from Leon,
then to Dwayne in med school,

20:42.075 --> 20:43.993
sex always felt like a distraction.

20:43.993 --> 20:44.953
A distraction?

20:44.953 --> 20:47.872
Sounds like those guys had no idea
what they're doing.

20:49.749 --> 20:52.335
Once I was intimate in a relationship,

20:53.211 --> 20:55.046
I felt less like my true self.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.131
And less close to God.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.551
That's why I stopped.

21:01.344 --> 21:02.470
Stopped?

21:02.971 --> 21:04.055
Like, stopped...

21:04.931 --> 21:05.974
Having sex.

21:08.851 --> 21:11.187
I don't intend to do it again
until I'm married.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.148
How long has it been?

21:14.857 --> 21:16.401
Years ago, before we met.

21:16.401 --> 21:19.278
You never told me.
We joke about sex all the time.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.948
I go along with the joke
so I don't become the joke.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.367
I'd never make fun of you for that.

21:24.367 --> 21:29.288
Leah, you told me my Bible study group
was "Fantasy Faithball."

21:31.958 --> 21:33.001
I'm sorry.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.629
But then what was your plan with Perez?

21:37.213 --> 21:38.881
The same as any guy I date.

21:38.881 --> 21:41.342
It's not like I don't kiss
or some other things.

21:42.218 --> 21:45.805
But if a man is not willing to commit
to who I am as a person

21:45.805 --> 21:48.266
or what I believe in,
he's not worth my time.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.102
It's just...

21:51.978 --> 21:53.855
seems a bit extreme.

21:55.148 --> 21:56.649
And a little sad.

21:57.275 --> 21:59.694
It can be a really fun part of life,

21:59.694 --> 22:02.321
and you've just cut yourself off from it.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.406
You're not listening.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.700
For me, it wasn't a value add, It was the...

22:07.160 --> 22:09.037
This is why I don't tell people.

22:18.796 --> 22:21.632
It's impossible to know
how to shape and size this valve

22:21.632 --> 22:23.676
without knowing the shape of the heart.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.679
We won't know until
Lim finishes repairing the ventricle.

22:30.141 --> 22:32.101
He'd be better off with a transplant.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.395
I agree.

22:35.605 --> 22:38.858
The patient's going along
because Lim's steamrolled him.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.954
A square peg won't seal a round hole,

22:51.954 --> 22:55.124
and by the time we find that out,
it'll be too late.

22:55.124 --> 22:58.628
It is not a perfect solution,
but it's the best we have.

22:58.628 --> 23:01.798
You've explained to Bob
how imperfect the solution is?

23:03.257 --> 23:06.886
He's aware of the risks,
and that he has limited options.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.597
Sometimes they need help
making difficult decisions.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.850
I don't think this is a decision
you should be making for him.

23:13.434 --> 23:14.936
And I'm not the only one.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.070
I trust you.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.866
We're operating on Bob
first thing in the morning.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.752
Her blood pressure skyrocketed.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.421
She could have a stroke.
Start IV labetalol.

23:45.341 --> 23:47.718
- This is why children shouldn't have--
- Stop.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.847
You need to focus on the medicine.

23:52.723 --> 23:56.144
She's going into critical bradycardia.
We need to push atropine.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.405
My patient's blood pressure
has remained stable.

24:07.405 --> 24:08.906
We can operate tomorrow.

24:09.407 --> 24:10.241
That's great.

24:11.409 --> 24:12.660
This smells amazing.

24:16.330 --> 24:17.665
Tastes even better.

24:17.665 --> 24:20.042
The secret is thyme. It has to be fresh.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.712
If you let it dry, it saps all the flavor.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.630
That and a little bit of lemon zest.

24:24.630 --> 24:29.093
Truth bomb. I might have oversold
my enthusiasm for you staying here,

24:29.093 --> 24:31.304
but If you keep cooking
like Gordon Ramsay,

24:31.304 --> 24:32.555
I won't let you leave.

24:33.848 --> 24:36.225
As much as I love sleeping in a twin bed

24:36.225 --> 24:38.227
in a half remodeled nursery,

24:38.227 --> 24:40.104
I think I may have to decline.

24:42.607 --> 24:43.691
Yeah, Ruben.

24:45.359 --> 24:47.028
That's double the quote.

24:47.570 --> 24:50.156
Okay. Yeah. Approved.

24:51.324 --> 24:54.827
Unbelievable. Now I have to replace
the roof rafters.

24:55.578 --> 24:58.456
If it's so much work,
why not just get a brand new house?

24:58.456 --> 25:00.625
Why do that? I love the house.

25:00.625 --> 25:05.171
It's ancient, too big for one person,
and completely falling apart.

25:05.171 --> 25:08.716
You do complain a lot about
all the repairs you have to do.

25:10.218 --> 25:13.763
That is the house where we brought
Maddie home as a newborn.

25:13.763 --> 25:17.141
That is the house where we celebrated
every birthday of hers.

25:17.725 --> 25:20.728
Every year, we turned it
into a haunted house

25:20.728 --> 25:23.940
with a cemetery in the backyard,
and a fog machine.

25:23.940 --> 25:27.443
We scared the living daylights
out of every kid in the neighborhood.

25:31.405 --> 25:34.283
I come home into that foyer...

25:35.409 --> 25:41.749
and that staircase is where
Maddie would descend in her prom dress.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.629
You can never sell that house.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.134
I can never sell that house.

25:56.097 --> 25:59.642
Clinic's low on phlebotomy kits.
Could we steal some from surgical?

25:59.642 --> 26:02.520
Sure. Just make us whole
when your shipment gets in.

26:04.522 --> 26:07.942
- Andrews offered me--
- I heard. Congrats. You deserve it.

26:07.942 --> 26:09.402
Thanks. I do.

26:09.402 --> 26:13.781
But... you're smart,
aggressive and ambitious.

26:13.781 --> 26:16.033
I'm sensing there's another "but."

26:17.743 --> 26:19.578
You decided to never have kids.

26:21.330 --> 26:24.750
Wouldn't really say I decided,
it just never happened.

26:26.127 --> 26:27.503
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

26:27.503 --> 26:29.588
I can't be both the mother I'd want to be,

26:29.588 --> 26:32.425
and the driven perfectionist
surgeon I know I am.

26:35.928 --> 26:36.846
My advice...

26:37.638 --> 26:40.141
decide what brings you
the most fulfillment

26:40.141 --> 26:42.018
and then commit fully to that.

26:42.018 --> 26:43.519
You can't have it all.

26:44.478 --> 26:47.023
- But plenty of men--
- No, they don't.

26:47.815 --> 26:50.818
They're just less conflicted about
the choices they make.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.496
You totally put me on the spot with Lim.

27:03.164 --> 27:06.792
- I never said I was gonna back you up.
- You're right. My bad.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.378
Probation means different things for us.

27:10.046 --> 27:11.547
Yours is a slap on the wrist,

27:11.547 --> 27:13.758
a correction
for coloring outside the lines.

27:14.592 --> 27:15.885
I'm in a holding pattern,

27:15.885 --> 27:19.555
while everybody watches to see
if I'm actually a surgeon or a junkie.

27:20.514 --> 27:24.977
Part of being a surgeon is standing up
and fighting for your patients.

28:13.401 --> 28:15.820
Why is your robe hanging
on the bathroom door?

28:15.820 --> 28:18.823
I didn't. I lent my extra one
to Dr. Glassman.

28:18.823 --> 28:21.200
You both hang your robes
outside the bathroom?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.952
I never noticed that before.

28:32.753 --> 28:34.672
I'm glad you find it so amusing.

28:34.672 --> 28:35.840
What'd you expect?

28:35.840 --> 28:38.717
You sneak attacked your husband
when you had a house guest.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.220
Who else hangs their robe
outside the bathroom

28:41.220 --> 28:43.514
so the steam doesn't make it moist?

28:44.723 --> 28:45.975
And that's not all.

28:45.975 --> 28:48.394
Their cooking techniques, cleaning styles,

28:48.394 --> 28:50.229
how they lay out their toiletries.

28:51.772 --> 28:54.400
- You said he's like Shaun's father.
- Yeah.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.110
The apple doesn't fall far.

28:56.110 --> 28:58.988
Somehow, in this case,
I think Shaun's the tree.

29:00.489 --> 29:03.576
One thing's clear,
Grandpa Glassman needs a new robe,

29:03.576 --> 29:05.494
different from your husband's.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.414
Grandpa Glassy. I love that.

29:08.414 --> 29:11.417
If only I could erase
a certain image of Grandpa Glassy.

29:15.171 --> 29:21.302
Hey, I'm really sorry about saying
you were extreme and sad.

29:23.012 --> 29:24.013
Thank you.

29:24.847 --> 29:29.602
It's unfair of me to blame you
for being surprised at something...

29:29.602 --> 29:31.604
I've intentionally never shared.

29:32.229 --> 29:33.731
Abstinence is important to me,

29:33.731 --> 29:37.067
but I don't always feel comfortable
being open about it.

29:37.693 --> 29:39.820
I'm really glad you did.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.617
Do you have a vibrator?

29:44.617 --> 29:47.661
Because in terms of getting closer to God,
I find--

29:47.661 --> 29:50.247
No, we're not talking about this
right now.

29:51.582 --> 29:52.958
Two croissants, please.

29:55.252 --> 29:56.879
Cut this suture, Dr. Wolke.

30:00.925 --> 30:03.886
The valve is seated... nicely.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.140
I've removed a lot of scar tissue
from this ventricle,

30:08.140 --> 30:09.433
but there's still more.

30:09.433 --> 30:12.436
We need enough viable tissue
to close this ventricle.

30:14.647 --> 30:16.148
I don't think we have it.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.692
Hold this clamp tight.

30:22.196 --> 30:24.865
This area looked good
in the pre-op MIBI scan,

30:24.865 --> 30:26.075
but it's dead now.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.410
Must be delayed apoptosis.

30:32.039 --> 30:33.082
What's the plan?

30:35.668 --> 30:38.128
I need an idea. Any idea.

30:42.299 --> 30:47.096
We could do an additional vessel bypass,
it might restore some hibernating tissue.

30:47.096 --> 30:50.057
But we'd never find enough
to make up for this deficit.

30:50.057 --> 30:51.559
Can we use a synthetic patch?

30:51.559 --> 30:54.103
It needs muscle tissue,
for the ventricle to pump.

30:54.103 --> 30:57.064
A heart can't function
without a working right ventricle.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.113
Unless, we do what we do
in babies with Ebstein's Anomaly.

31:04.113 --> 31:06.532
Bypass the defective right ventricle

31:06.532 --> 31:09.159
and divert deoxygenated blood
back to the lungs.

31:11.245 --> 31:14.290
He'd only have one ventricle
pumping blood to his entire body.

31:14.290 --> 31:16.792
In time, the left ventricle
will get stronger.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.919
Those babies live to be teenagers.

31:18.919 --> 31:21.589
- That will buy us time to find a donor.
- Let's go.

31:26.885 --> 31:27.761
Hey.

31:28.887 --> 31:32.308
They already have four clinical trials
with IRB approval.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.855
I am honored that you thought of me.

31:39.773 --> 31:40.774
It's just...

31:42.359 --> 31:45.279
I'm trying to get pregnant,
IVF with a donor.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.698
And I've decided...

31:49.742 --> 31:50.951
I can't have it all.

31:59.710 --> 32:03.631
At the risk of overstepping...

32:05.341 --> 32:07.551
I think you're selling yourself short.

32:09.845 --> 32:13.390
My mother was the Senior Director
for Human Rights First,

32:13.390 --> 32:15.017
total workaholic.

32:15.017 --> 32:17.561
Growing up, sometimes it seemed

32:17.561 --> 32:20.189
like she was always
on the phone or a plane.

32:21.148 --> 32:23.400
- Must have been hard.
- It wasn't easy.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.695
But when I really needed her,
she was always there.

32:28.238 --> 32:29.657
She was my idol.

32:29.657 --> 32:31.075
And to this day...

32:32.534 --> 32:34.787
I need advice on a tough decision...

32:35.704 --> 32:37.539
she's my first call.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.754
There's more to being a great mom
than parent teacher conferences.

32:49.426 --> 32:53.097
- Is her pressure climbing?
- No, 120 over 81, holding steady.

32:53.722 --> 32:56.141
Curettage is complete.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.143
The entire tumor's evacuated.

32:58.143 --> 32:59.853
Massage the uterine fundus.

33:03.107 --> 33:04.733
Pressure's dropping. Fast.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.527
She is going into shock.

33:07.569 --> 33:10.364
Could the tumor have caused
a bleeding disorder?

33:10.364 --> 33:12.074
There's no bleeding down here.

33:12.074 --> 33:14.034
Push vasopressors and fluids.

33:16.495 --> 33:17.496
What is this?

33:25.170 --> 33:27.673
The tumor thinned her uterine wall.

33:27.673 --> 33:30.175
She's perforated and bleeding internally.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.802
Prep her for a laparotomy.

33:31.802 --> 33:33.804
Rapid infuse two units of O neg.

33:33.804 --> 33:37.391
We need to isolate the vessel
and clamp it before she--

33:39.727 --> 33:41.395
We just lost her pulse.

33:41.395 --> 33:42.646
Retraction.

33:49.820 --> 33:52.072
A uni heart? That's new.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.074
Once we removed the scar tissue,

33:54.074 --> 33:57.745
there was even less viable muscle
than what we anticipated.

33:57.745 --> 34:00.289
Dr. Wolke came through with the audible.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.959
A sports reference,
she's saying it was your idea.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.671
Which Dr. Lim executed brilliantly.

34:07.671 --> 34:09.798
I'd say that even if she weren't here.

34:10.674 --> 34:12.801
You'll still need
a donor heart eventually,

34:12.801 --> 34:16.013
but this should buy you five years,
maybe more, before that.

34:17.055 --> 34:17.890
Thank you.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.903
The surgery was too dangerous for Bob.
You were right.

34:31.612 --> 34:35.407
And about advocating for the patient
even when you were pissing me off.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.452
Might've helped
if I had the uni-heart idea

34:38.452 --> 34:41.163
before the patient was
splayed open on the table.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.373
Sometimes great things
come out of pressure,

34:43.373 --> 34:45.375
although I try not to depend on them.

34:45.375 --> 34:49.671
It sounds like the perfect prelude
to letting me off probation...

34:49.671 --> 34:50.839
Don't push it.

34:51.548 --> 34:54.134
But... excellent work.

34:54.134 --> 34:55.302
Keep it up.

34:57.596 --> 34:58.806
You, too, Dr. Perez.

35:09.107 --> 35:09.983
Hi, honey.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.238
Is it over?

35:14.905 --> 35:19.201
Your surgery was a lot more complicated
than anticipated

35:19.201 --> 35:21.078
and it was successful.

35:22.162 --> 35:23.413
We got all the tumor.

35:25.123 --> 35:28.669
- Everything kind of hurts.
- I will increase your medication.

35:31.588 --> 35:33.090
- Ryan.
- Hey.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.886
I thought this little guy
might make you feel better.

35:39.471 --> 35:42.224
- He's such a cutie.
- I got him at the gift shop.

35:42.808 --> 35:43.892
I brought your laptop.

35:43.892 --> 35:46.728
The group-chat's blowing up
about this new Apex update.

35:47.521 --> 35:50.607
- Is there Wi-Fi here?
- Kelli needs to rest tonight.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.360
And when you go home,

35:53.360 --> 35:58.073
sexual activity will be very risky,
given the trauma of your surgery.

36:00.033 --> 36:03.161
- For how long?
- Six months at least.

36:03.996 --> 36:07.082
And maybe you should think about
waiting even longer.

36:08.584 --> 36:10.252
We'll talk more about this later.

36:13.755 --> 36:14.756
Thank you.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.010
Both.

36:20.888 --> 36:22.222
For saving my girl.

36:43.076 --> 36:45.162
Hey, it's Danny...

36:46.914 --> 36:49.291
Yeah, having a bit of a rough week.

36:50.250 --> 36:51.168
Thanks, man.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.962
You know where St. Bon's is?

36:55.255 --> 36:58.383
There's a coffee shop two blocks West.
Meet you there in 20.

36:59.092 --> 36:59.927
Okay.

37:08.518 --> 37:09.645
This is awkward.

37:11.271 --> 37:12.940
What's awkward? Nothing happened.

37:13.941 --> 37:16.151
- What do you mean?
- Nothing happened.

37:16.151 --> 37:18.111
- Right. Nothing happened.
- Exactly.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.950
That is very impressive.

37:22.950 --> 37:27.496
If I saw your mom totally naked
and I was also totally naked,

37:27.496 --> 37:28.747
I would never forget--

37:28.747 --> 37:30.624
- That's not helping.
- Thanks, Shaun.

37:31.708 --> 37:34.711
All things considered,
I actually had a really nice time.

37:35.671 --> 37:37.506
Yeah, I'll be craving that salmon.

37:37.506 --> 37:39.299
I wrote down the recipe.

37:39.299 --> 37:43.011
The salmon comes out a lot more tender
out of my Viking oven,

37:43.011 --> 37:46.139
I'm going to have you both
over to dinner as a thank you.

37:46.139 --> 37:49.142
- My neighbor is calling.
- The one who stole your lawnmower?

37:49.142 --> 37:51.520
The one who cut back my trees
without asking.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.729
Yes, Brent.

37:54.314 --> 37:55.440
Slow down.

37:58.068 --> 37:59.277
What?

38:09.955 --> 38:10.914
Danny.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.918
I was surprised to hear from you.
Heard you went to rehab.

38:15.627 --> 38:16.461
Yeah.

38:17.045 --> 38:18.714
All good. Been four times myself.

38:19.339 --> 38:20.716
I'm kind of in a hurry.

38:21.633 --> 38:26.263
It's mostly black tar around right now,
but I got little bit of white.

38:32.561 --> 38:36.440
It ain't cheap, but you're a doctor.
I'm sure you can afford it.

38:36.440 --> 38:39.443
<i>The less we say about it the better</i>

38:39.443 --> 38:42.863
<i>Make it up as we go along</i>

38:43.530 --> 38:44.614
<i>Feet on the ground</i>

38:44.614 --> 38:45.866
Yo?

38:45.866 --> 38:47.868
<i>Head in the sky</i>

38:47.868 --> 38:49.327
We doing this or not?

38:49.327 --> 38:52.330
<i>I know nothing's wrong... nothing</i>

38:52.330 --> 38:56.001
<i>Hey, yo, I got plenty of time</i>

38:56.001 --> 38:58.128
How'd your case go with the probationers?

38:59.087 --> 39:00.380
They both did good.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.090
Great to hear.

39:02.716 --> 39:03.967
Keep it up, Chief.

39:07.512 --> 39:11.516
<i>And you're standing here beside me</i>

39:12.642 --> 39:15.228
<i>I love of the passing of time</i>

39:16.438 --> 39:20.400
<i>Never for money, always for love</i>

39:20.400 --> 39:23.612
<i>Cover up and say good night</i>

39:23.612 --> 39:25.822
<i>- Say good night
- Say good night</i>

39:25.822 --> 39:32.746
<i>Say good night</i>

39:32.746 --> 39:35.999
<i>Home, is where I want to be</i>

39:35.999 --> 39:39.503
<i>But I guess I'm already there</i>

39:40.420 --> 39:41.880
<i>I come home</i>

39:42.839 --> 39:44.633
<i>She lifted up her wings</i>

39:44.633 --> 39:47.844
<i>I guess that this must be the place</i>

39:47.844 --> 39:48.762
Danny.

39:50.597 --> 39:52.057
Are you looking for me?

39:52.766 --> 39:58.647
No, I was just walking by
and I heard the choir.

40:00.607 --> 40:01.733
It's comforting.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.320
We practice every Thursday, and I'm late.

40:06.363 --> 40:09.241
Don't mind me.
I'll just sit here if that's okay.

40:09.241 --> 40:13.453
<i>Hey, yo, you got light in your eyes</i>

40:15.622 --> 40:16.623
Are you okay?

40:18.583 --> 40:19.584
Yeah.

40:21.378 --> 40:23.922
<i>I love the passing of time</i>

40:25.257 --> 40:29.636
<i>Never for money, always for love</i>

40:29.636 --> 40:32.556
<i>Cover up and say good night</i>

40:32.556 --> 40:34.850
<i>- Say good night
- Say good night</i>

40:34.850 --> 40:41.648
<i>Say good night</i>

40:49.739 --> 40:53.243
<i>Home, is where I want to be</i>

40:53.243 --> 40:56.580
<i>But I guess I'm already there</i>

40:57.330 --> 40:59.249
<i>I come home</i>

40:59.249 --> 41:01.626
<i>She lifted up her wings</i>

41:01.626 --> 41:05.213
<i>I guess that this must be the place</i>

41:06.214 --> 41:09.092
<i>I can't tell one from another</i>

41:09.801 --> 41:11.970
<i>Did I find you, or you find me?</i>

41:11.970 --> 41:13.972
- Are you the homeowner?
- What happened?

41:14.639 --> 41:17.767
Electrical fire in the kitchen.
Old house, old wiring.

41:17.767 --> 41:20.061
Wouldn't have been so bad
but the termite guys

41:20.061 --> 41:21.897
disconnected the smoke detectors.

41:22.981 --> 41:23.940
I'm sorry.

41:24.983 --> 41:28.028
<i>- You got plenty of time
- Hey, yo</i>

41:28.820 --> 41:32.782
<i>Hey, yo, hey, yo</i>

41:32.782 --> 41:34.659
<i>You got plenty of time</i>
