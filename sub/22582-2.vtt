WEBVTT

00:07.887 --> 00:09.923
- Say when.
- When.

00:11.207 --> 00:13.357
I didn't know you drank wine.

00:13.647 --> 00:17.196
Under the circumstances,
I'll allow myself a small indulgence.

00:17.327 --> 00:19.522
Make mine a large indulgence.

00:21.607 --> 00:23.438
To our science officer.

00:23.847 --> 00:28.716
It's been one year to the day
since you officially joined our crew.

00:29.847 --> 00:31.565
Here's to many more.

00:32.207 --> 00:33.560
I appreciate the sentiment...

00:33.687 --> 00:35.882
but I'm simply
carrying out my assignment.

00:36.007 --> 00:38.237
That's no small accomplishment,
considering...

00:38.367 --> 00:42.599
the previous record for a Vulcan serving
on a human ship was two weeks.

00:42.887 --> 00:44.115
Ten days.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.760
I've been filling out
your annual crew evaluation.

00:48.887 --> 00:51.162
- Just a formality.
- I understand.

00:51.527 --> 00:54.803
The High Command has requested
my evaluation of you.

00:56.447 --> 00:58.085
Just a formality.

00:58.407 --> 01:01.763
There's something in your record
I've been meaning to ask you about.

01:01.887 --> 01:05.641
While you were stationed in Sausalito,
you took a five-day leave.

01:05.767 --> 01:06.802
Yes.

01:07.007 --> 01:10.761
You went to an old mining town
in Pennsylvania, Carbon Creek.

01:11.567 --> 01:14.320
Seems like an odd place
to take a vacation.

01:14.447 --> 01:16.597
Vulcans don't take vacations.

01:17.287 --> 01:20.962
Then if I may ask, why'd you go there?

01:21.647 --> 01:23.842
Is this part of my evaluation?

01:25.327 --> 01:26.726
Just curious.

01:27.447 --> 01:29.403
It was a personal matter.

01:30.967 --> 01:34.118
You had a personal matter
in Carbon Creek, Pennsylvania?

01:34.247 --> 01:37.239
Trip, if she doesn't want to tell us...

01:37.367 --> 01:40.404
Seems a little unfair.
We tell her plenty of stories.

01:40.527 --> 01:42.358
You'd like me to tell you a story?

01:42.487 --> 01:44.159
If it's a good one.

01:46.687 --> 01:48.962
I went to Carbon Creek
because I wanted to visit...

01:49.087 --> 01:52.443
the site of first contact
between humans and Vulcans.

01:53.767 --> 01:56.327
Then you were
about 3,000 kilometres off.

01:56.447 --> 01:57.846
That took place in Montana.

01:57.967 --> 01:59.878
Actually, it didn't.

02:00.007 --> 02:01.406
Every school kid knows that...

02:01.527 --> 02:06.078
Zefram Cochrane met the Vulcans
in Bozeman, Montana, on April 5, 2063.

02:06.407 --> 02:08.841
I've been there. There's a statue.

02:08.967 --> 02:11.959
In fact, the Vulcans visited Earth
long before then.

02:12.087 --> 02:14.647
My second foremother was one of them.

02:14.807 --> 02:16.035
Your who?

02:17.527 --> 02:19.643
My mother's mother's mother.

02:25.127 --> 02:27.482
Would you like to hear the story?

02:31.167 --> 02:33.727
It's been a long road

02:36.327 --> 02:38.363
Gettin' from there to here

02:38.527 --> 02:41.325
It's been a long time

02:42.127 --> 02:45.597
But my time is finally near

02:46.087 --> 02:49.477
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

02:50.327 --> 02:53.160
I will touch the sky

02:53.567 --> 02:57.196
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

02:57.327 --> 03:00.319
No, they're not gonna change my mind

03:00.447 --> 03:04.725
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

03:04.887 --> 03:07.959
I'm going where my heart will take me

03:08.087 --> 03:12.239
I've got faith to believe

03:12.367 --> 03:15.325
I can do anything

03:15.447 --> 03:19.156
I've got strength of the soul

03:19.767 --> 03:22.759
And no one's gonna bend or break me

03:22.887 --> 03:27.085
I can reach any star

03:28.247 --> 03:30.238
I've got faith

03:32.087 --> 03:35.204
I've got faith

03:35.767 --> 03:39.043
Faith of the heart

03:41.000 --> 03:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:06.127 --> 04:07.845
I can't compensate.

04:08.607 --> 04:11.041
The refusion pressure is still dropping.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.398
If our orbit decays any further,
we'll be detected.

04:15.407 --> 04:17.125
They'd gone to Earth to investigate...

04:17.247 --> 04:20.762
the launch of its first artificial satellite,
called Sputnik.

04:20.887 --> 04:24.323
During their third week of gathering
information about humanity...

04:24.447 --> 04:27.041
their impulse manifold
began to malfunction.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.204
They had no choice
but to attempt an emergency landing.

04:30.487 --> 04:32.682
Try to find an isolated area.

04:33.487 --> 04:36.240
Send a distress call
to the High Command.

04:43.527 --> 04:45.040
One hundred kilometres.

04:45.167 --> 04:46.236
Deploy the stabilisers.

04:47.767 --> 04:50.076
Our landing vector is too steep.

05:29.807 --> 05:32.116
- Are you hurt?
- I don't think so.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.161
Captain.

05:42.007 --> 05:43.804
What are your orders?

05:46.527 --> 05:49.166
Why did the Vulcans keep this a secret?

05:49.727 --> 05:51.206
The incident is well-documented...

05:51.327 --> 05:53.921
at the Science Directorate
and the Space Council.

05:54.047 --> 05:56.083
- On Vulcan?
- Of course.

05:57.287 --> 05:58.515
Hang on.

05:59.367 --> 06:01.676
T'Mir was your great-grandmother?

06:03.047 --> 06:05.515
I'd be the last person
to question your math...

06:05.647 --> 06:07.877
but aren't you missing
a few generations?

06:08.007 --> 06:09.884
Sputnik was 200 years ago.

06:10.007 --> 06:12.441
Don't forget how long Vulcans live.

06:12.567 --> 06:13.716
Right.

06:15.087 --> 06:16.884
Just how old are you?

06:19.287 --> 06:21.437
It has got to be in her record.

06:21.927 --> 06:24.964
Trip, that's classified information.

06:26.527 --> 06:27.676
Please...

06:28.647 --> 06:29.762
go on.

06:33.447 --> 06:36.405
Their subspace transceiver
was damaged in the crash.

06:36.527 --> 06:37.960
They had no way of knowing...

06:38.087 --> 06:40.726
if their distress signal
had even been transmitted.

06:40.847 --> 06:44.157
They'd used up their emergency rations
within a week.

06:44.567 --> 06:49.118
After five days without food,
their situation was growing desperate.

07:02.447 --> 07:03.926
Two life forms.

07:20.647 --> 07:22.000
Fascinating.

07:25.167 --> 07:28.603
One of those creatures
could sustain us for some time.

07:29.567 --> 07:31.956
Are you suggesting we eat it?

07:33.167 --> 07:36.079
It's logical to take extreme measures
to survive.

07:36.287 --> 07:38.243
Even resorting to savagery?

07:38.367 --> 07:40.358
That may not be necessary.

07:40.967 --> 07:44.880
Our scans showed a settlement
approximately six kilometres away.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.919
If we're exposed,
we could contaminate their culture.

07:49.047 --> 07:52.084
And when they find our bodies
after we starve...

07:52.207 --> 07:54.163
will that contaminate their culture?

07:54.287 --> 07:57.757
Better to leave them with a mystery
than with three living aliens.

07:57.887 --> 08:00.685
We should at least
investigate the possibilities.

08:00.807 --> 08:02.479
It's too dangerous.

08:02.847 --> 08:04.200
I'm willing to take the risk.

08:06.287 --> 08:07.515
Mestral.

08:09.527 --> 08:10.926
Remain here.

08:30.047 --> 08:32.197
How do you suggest we proceed?

08:34.126 --> 08:36.482
We'll need to disguise ourselves.

08:42.727 --> 08:45.321
We're here to find food. Nothing else.

08:45.767 --> 08:49.316
We'll keep contact with the humans
to an absolute minimum.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.756
If we must interact with them...

08:54.127 --> 08:55.526
I will speak.

08:58.807 --> 09:00.126
What is it?

09:01.007 --> 09:04.761
I believe you have
that garment on backwards.

09:28.007 --> 09:29.326
Prisoners?

09:30.047 --> 09:34.120
They don't appear to be restrained.
More likely, labourers.

09:34.647 --> 09:36.797
It's hard to believe
these people were capable...

09:36.927 --> 09:38.918
of launching an artificial satellite.

09:39.487 --> 09:43.400
And he gets the sign,
and here's the pitch.

09:43.967 --> 09:46.162
Dixon hits a scorcher
down the right-field line.

09:46.287 --> 09:48.596
The first baseman makes a stab at it,
but no!

09:48.727 --> 09:52.242
Ellis is charging hard from right field,
and he scoops it up and fires.

09:52.367 --> 09:53.686
It's gonna be close.

09:53.807 --> 09:55.365
There's a collision at the plate...

09:55.487 --> 09:59.162
but Wilcox hangs on to the ball
and Thompson is out!

10:03.847 --> 10:05.599
Some type of combat, no doubt.

10:05.727 --> 10:07.479
I believe it may be an entertainment.

10:24.247 --> 10:27.319
- A communal gathering place.
- Do they have food?

10:29.567 --> 10:31.046
It appears so.

10:34.807 --> 10:36.081
Remember.

10:36.247 --> 10:37.726
I won't speak.

11:14.847 --> 11:15.882
Another?

11:16.007 --> 11:17.918
- No, I'll settle up.
- All right.

11:18.047 --> 11:19.275
I'm next.

11:22.287 --> 11:23.959
- Currency.
- Yes.

11:24.127 --> 11:26.436
The paper appears to have value.

11:28.007 --> 11:29.440
Thanks, Billy.

11:30.807 --> 11:32.525
What can I get you?

11:34.247 --> 11:37.159
Do you have anything
that doesn't require currency?

11:37.287 --> 11:38.720
You mean, free?

11:44.407 --> 11:46.716
What brings you to Carbon Creek?

11:48.487 --> 11:51.843
We had an accident with our vehicle
outside your town.

11:51.967 --> 11:53.958
- Are you okay?
- We're fine.

11:55.447 --> 11:57.039
You folks married?

11:57.207 --> 11:58.196
No.

11:58.407 --> 12:01.479
We're business associates.

12:02.527 --> 12:05.564
There's a gas station up the road.
I'd be happy to give you a lift.

12:06.527 --> 12:07.960
No, thank you.

12:08.087 --> 12:09.520
Suit yourself.

12:12.727 --> 12:15.321
Anybody up for a game? Quarter a ball?

12:15.567 --> 12:16.682
I'll play.

12:16.807 --> 12:19.241
You'd better ask your mother, Jackie.

12:23.007 --> 12:24.759
Come on, Mum.
We could use the money.

12:24.887 --> 12:27.082
Go on upstairs and do your homework.

12:27.207 --> 12:29.402
I'll bring you up some dinner.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.759
I'm up for a game.

12:36.847 --> 12:39.236
What are you doing?
I told you not to speak to anyone.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.482
I can defeat him.

12:40.647 --> 12:43.559
- You don't even know the rules.
- It's simple.

12:48.727 --> 12:51.878
- I thought you didn't have any money.
- He doesn't.

12:54.167 --> 12:57.557
Well, sorry, pal.
There's nothing in it for me.

12:58.327 --> 13:00.204
It's time for us to go.

13:01.327 --> 13:04.205
Wait a minute. We might be able
to work something out.

13:04.327 --> 13:06.238
If you win, I'll pay up.

13:06.447 --> 13:10.679
If I win, your business associate
has a drink with me.

13:11.527 --> 13:13.916
- We accept your terms.
- We do not.

13:16.847 --> 13:19.486
The game is based on simple geometry.

13:19.607 --> 13:21.643
- It wouldn't challenge a Vulcan child.
- No.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.120
We need their currency.

13:23.247 --> 13:25.602
What if you lose? I'll have to...

13:26.527 --> 13:28.199
socialise with him.

13:33.767 --> 13:36.201
Would you rather die of starvation?

13:41.447 --> 13:42.846
Tough break.

14:40.407 --> 14:42.284
The number-eight ball...

14:44.327 --> 14:45.806
in that pocket.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.120
Cryogenics.

15:03.527 --> 15:06.564
Do you suppose they've experimented
with protein replicators?

15:06.687 --> 15:08.564
Why didn't you ask the merchant?

15:08.687 --> 15:12.316
You seemed willing to engage
everyone else in conversation.

15:15.607 --> 15:17.643
I think that wine's gone to your head.

15:17.767 --> 15:19.564
What are you implying?

15:21.047 --> 15:24.801
Two Vulcans stroll into a bar,
hustle a few games of pool...

15:25.127 --> 15:27.925
and walk out with an armload
of TV dinners.

15:28.127 --> 15:31.119
Sounds like an old episode
of the Twilight Zone.

15:31.247 --> 15:33.317
If you're not interested
in hearing the rest...

15:33.447 --> 15:36.405
Hold on.
We didn't say we weren't interested.

15:46.447 --> 15:49.086
They realised
they couldn't rely on gambling...

15:49.207 --> 15:51.516
so they took whatever employment
they could find...

15:51.647 --> 15:54.719
while they waited
for a rescue vessel to arrive.

16:12.767 --> 16:14.246
But, as the weeks passed...

16:14.367 --> 16:18.121
it seemed less likely that
their distress call had been received...

16:18.247 --> 16:22.286
and it became more difficult for them
to avoid the humans.

16:23.487 --> 16:28.242
The test of a nuclear device is designed
for tactical use in place of artillery.

16:28.367 --> 16:30.801
Zero hour was just after...

16:31.447 --> 16:34.359
Nothing like an atomic test
to make your day.

16:34.687 --> 16:36.325
Doesn't it concern you?

16:36.447 --> 16:39.086
The bomb? It scares the hell out of me.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.926
I'd hate to see humanity destroy itself.

16:43.607 --> 16:45.359
That makes two of us.

16:46.647 --> 16:48.922
- Want to shoot some eight ball?
- Jack.

16:49.047 --> 16:51.720
I've got a geometry midterm next week.
It's good practice.

16:51.847 --> 16:55.078
Nice try, but there's better ways
to prepare for a math test.

16:55.207 --> 16:57.596
Are you interested in mathematics?

16:57.807 --> 17:01.356
It's what I want to study at college,
mechanical engineering.

17:01.567 --> 17:03.603
- Lf I get to go.
- You will.

17:04.646 --> 17:07.080
- He got a scholarship.
- Only a partial one.

17:07.207 --> 17:10.118
It's still a scholarship,
and you worked hard for it.

17:10.367 --> 17:13.006
Everybody's been pitching in
to help pay for his expenses:

17:13.127 --> 17:14.924
Books, room and board.

17:15.727 --> 17:17.843
You can shoot one rack, and that's it.

17:17.967 --> 17:19.116
Your break.

17:44.807 --> 17:49.039
This is the third time this week
I've had to fix Mrs. Garrett's sink.

17:49.927 --> 17:51.804
Perhaps she enjoys your company.

17:51.927 --> 17:56.045
It might be tolerable if her son
didn't insist on calling me Moe.

17:57.087 --> 17:58.805
Why does he do that?

17:59.007 --> 18:02.283
There is a comic actor
known as a "stooge" with that name.

18:02.407 --> 18:05.046
The boy believes we have similar hair.

18:05.447 --> 18:07.358
There is a resemblance.

18:08.007 --> 18:09.725
This is intolerable.

18:10.247 --> 18:12.238
I'm a warp-field engineer.

18:12.367 --> 18:15.643
Then perhaps you can help me
construct a subspace transceiver.

18:15.767 --> 18:17.917
I told you, it's impossible.

18:21.127 --> 18:23.197
If we remain here, we'll die.

18:23.327 --> 18:25.841
This world's on the brink
of self-annihilation.

18:25.967 --> 18:27.764
I don't believe that.

18:29.727 --> 18:33.356
Because your fascination
with this species is blinding you.

18:33.927 --> 18:37.602
You sit for hours each day
in front of this idiotic device.

18:37.807 --> 18:39.479
I'm doing research.

18:40.687 --> 18:43.963
Perhaps if you spent more time
observing human behaviour...

18:44.087 --> 18:46.476
you might not have
such a pessimistic view of them.

18:46.607 --> 18:49.280
Open your eyes. They revel in violence.

18:49.407 --> 18:51.477
They devote
what little technology they have...

18:51.607 --> 18:53.757
to devising ways of killing each other.

18:53.887 --> 18:55.878
So did we centuries ago.

18:57.247 --> 18:59.602
They just haven't realised
their potential yet.

18:59.727 --> 19:01.206
What potential?

19:02.927 --> 19:06.317
They have great empathy
and compassion.

19:06.967 --> 19:09.686
Look how we've been made
to feel welcome.

19:14.927 --> 19:17.521
Only because they believe we're human.

19:18.647 --> 19:20.797
If they discovered the truth...

19:21.727 --> 19:24.366
do you think
they'd be so compassionate?

19:29.727 --> 19:31.479
Where are you going?

19:32.127 --> 19:33.526
To the ship.

19:34.607 --> 19:35.676
Why?

19:35.807 --> 19:37.843
This antenna is inadequate.

19:38.407 --> 19:41.444
I believe I can use
a waveform discriminator to enhance it.

19:41.567 --> 19:45.321
It'll be safer to go after dark.
You can't risk being followed.

19:45.447 --> 19:47.039
I need to go now.

19:47.647 --> 19:49.638
I Love Lucy is on tonight.

20:14.367 --> 20:16.323
Hi. You're right on time.

20:49.527 --> 20:52.917
It was different than seeing it
on television. More...

20:53.807 --> 20:55.240
invigorating.

20:55.447 --> 20:57.802
There's another game next week,
if you'd like to go.

20:57.927 --> 21:00.964
Or we could do something else.
Take in a movie?

21:01.327 --> 21:03.238
That would be enjoyable.

21:04.207 --> 21:06.801
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

21:08.207 --> 21:10.357
What are you hiding under that cap?

21:10.487 --> 21:13.399
A pointed head?
You're not from Mars, are you?

21:15.407 --> 21:17.762
I didn't mean to make fun of you.

21:18.487 --> 21:20.045
I'm not offended.

21:21.087 --> 21:23.726
- May I ask you a question?
- Please.

21:25.207 --> 21:27.437
What happened to your mate?

21:27.887 --> 21:29.878
- You mean, my husband?
- Yes.

21:30.007 --> 21:31.918
He left a long time ago.

21:32.807 --> 21:35.162
Jack used to get letters from him
every now and then.

21:35.287 --> 21:37.881
The last we heard,
he'd moved to Phoenix.

21:39.847 --> 21:41.963
I was hoping he would help
with Jack's college...

21:42.087 --> 21:43.998
but I guess we're on our own.

21:44.127 --> 21:48.359
I can understand why he wouldn't want
to have anything to do with me, but...

21:50.807 --> 21:52.160
I'm sorry.

21:52.447 --> 21:56.884
I'm usually better at keeping a lid
on my emotions. It's not always easy.

21:57.527 --> 21:58.676
I know.

22:06.287 --> 22:08.517
I'm due back at the Pine Tree.

22:10.167 --> 22:12.158
Will I see you later?

22:28.687 --> 22:31.406
I didn't mean to. I thought...

22:31.767 --> 22:33.246
- Oh, God!
- Please.

22:33.367 --> 22:35.801
I was simply surprised. It was...

22:36.927 --> 22:39.282
- very pleasant.
- Pleasant?

22:39.807 --> 22:42.082
Wasn't that an appropriate response?

22:42.207 --> 22:44.243
Well, it's been a while
since I kissed a man...

22:44.367 --> 22:47.996
but still, I was hoping it'd be
a little bit more than pleasant.

22:49.127 --> 22:51.118
I did say very pleasant.

22:56.727 --> 22:58.365
We've got company.

23:04.567 --> 23:05.966
I should go.

23:10.647 --> 23:12.205
Thank you, again.

23:26.207 --> 23:28.084
Waveform discriminator?

23:28.727 --> 23:31.400
I went to a baseball game
in Doylestown.

23:32.927 --> 23:34.485
More research?

23:34.607 --> 23:37.201
Maggie invited me.
I didn't think it would be a problem.

23:37.327 --> 23:39.522
Then why did you lie about it?

23:39.967 --> 23:42.561
Because I knew
you wouldn't understand.

23:43.967 --> 23:46.640
You were engaging in intimate activity.

23:49.687 --> 23:51.405
I didn't initiate it.

23:53.767 --> 23:56.964
You're to have no further contact
with that woman.

23:58.607 --> 24:00.245
You can't make that decision.

24:00.367 --> 24:02.085
I'm still in command.

24:02.367 --> 24:03.959
Command of what?

24:04.527 --> 24:06.245
Our mission is over.

24:07.007 --> 24:10.920
It's time to accept the fact
that we may never leave this world.

24:46.887 --> 24:50.243
I was just gonna play some pool.
I didn't mean to bother you.

24:51.127 --> 24:52.799
What are you doing?

24:53.607 --> 24:55.484
I was about to meditate.

24:55.687 --> 24:56.881
Really?

24:57.847 --> 25:00.361
Are you just trying to clear your mind...

25:00.487 --> 25:02.876
or reach a higher spiritual plane?

25:04.047 --> 25:06.117
I spend a lot of time at the library.

25:06.247 --> 25:09.478
- Studying meditation techniques?
- Different things.

25:10.207 --> 25:12.323
Mostly about places I'd like to visit.

25:12.447 --> 25:15.723
Like Tibet. The Buddhist monks there
meditate every day.

25:15.847 --> 25:19.157
And in India,
they've got these mystics called fakirs.

25:19.287 --> 25:23.041
Supposedly, they can almost stop
their hearts just by using willpower.

25:23.167 --> 25:26.796
You'd be surprised what
a disciplined mind can accomplish.

25:28.087 --> 25:30.203
What else do you study at this library?

25:30.327 --> 25:32.841
Astronomy, literature...

25:33.207 --> 25:36.677
Sometimes, I'll just pick a book
off the shelf and start reading.

25:37.447 --> 25:39.881
What about you?
What do you like to read?

25:40.007 --> 25:43.602
- I have an interest in astronomy as well.
- Really?

25:44.407 --> 25:48.286
Did you know that minutes after dusk,
when the sun is just right...

25:48.407 --> 25:51.080
you can see Sputnik
with the naked eye?

25:52.047 --> 25:53.799
Maybe tomorrow I could show you.

25:53.927 --> 25:55.679
I've seen it already.

25:58.407 --> 26:00.602
It's amazing, don't you think?

26:02.727 --> 26:05.719
Well, I'll let you get back
to your meditating.

26:05.927 --> 26:08.487
- It was nice talking to you.
- And you.

26:22.767 --> 26:24.837
- Mestral.
- Hello.

26:24.967 --> 26:27.800
Hey, I got tickets to the ballgame
this weekend.

26:27.927 --> 26:32.159
It's a double-header.
Jim's going, Gavin, Jack, Maggie.

26:33.127 --> 26:34.765
I'm afraid I can't.

26:34.887 --> 26:38.641
What's wrong with you lately?
Maggie says you haven't even...

26:39.487 --> 26:41.796
- Are you all right, Billy?
- Yeah.

26:56.647 --> 26:59.605
- Why do you need us here?
- I'm looking for a particle weapon.

26:59.727 --> 27:01.877
- The armoury case, help me find it.
- Why?

27:02.007 --> 27:04.475
There's been an accident in the mine.

27:04.607 --> 27:06.279
At least 20 men are trapped.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.602
It could take the humans
days to free them.

27:08.727 --> 27:10.285
We can't interfere.

27:10.407 --> 27:11.840
They'll die.

27:18.367 --> 27:20.483
You'd let them suffocate...

27:20.607 --> 27:22.359
even if we could prevent it.

27:22.487 --> 27:24.318
What if they see the weapon?

27:24.447 --> 27:26.483
We'll be certain they don't.

27:26.607 --> 27:30.646
At best, these humans
only live to be 60 or 70.

27:32.127 --> 27:35.802
Is it worth the risk just to extend
their lives a few more years?

27:35.927 --> 27:38.361
We can't contaminate their culture.

27:38.927 --> 27:41.680
This has nothing to do
with contamination.

27:43.527 --> 27:45.677
It has to do with compassion.

27:45.967 --> 27:47.366
Compassion...

27:49.087 --> 27:50.520
is an emotion.

27:50.807 --> 27:53.765
They're my friends,
and I'm going to help them.

27:54.447 --> 27:56.199
Don't try to stop me.

28:42.527 --> 28:43.516
Yes.

28:43.647 --> 28:47.322
Proceed 22 metres,
then turn right at the junction.

28:47.447 --> 28:48.436
Understood.

28:50.447 --> 28:53.803
In eight metres, you'll find
a narrow opening near the ground...

28:53.927 --> 28:56.282
that leads to an abandoned shaft.

28:56.607 --> 28:58.404
I think we're getting
more guys down there.

28:58.527 --> 29:00.483
- Is the ride free up there?
- Yeah.

29:31.687 --> 29:35.236
There's a stratum of quartz
on the wall, opposite the opening.

29:35.367 --> 29:36.402
I see it.

29:36.527 --> 29:39.758
Set your dispersal radius to 7 degrees.

29:46.607 --> 29:48.199
Two more metres.

30:04.847 --> 30:06.041
How far?

30:06.247 --> 30:08.158
Approximately 30 metres.

30:14.127 --> 30:16.516
Here. Over here.

30:28.207 --> 30:30.038
After rescuing the 12 miners...

30:30.167 --> 30:32.601
Mestral became
something of a hero that day.

30:32.887 --> 30:34.878
Didn't people wonder
how he got them out?

30:35.007 --> 30:36.679
I'm sure they did.

30:36.807 --> 30:39.367
But no one ever discovered the truth.

30:39.927 --> 30:41.121
Three months passed...

30:41.247 --> 30:43.920
and just as they had resigned
themselves to the fact that...

30:44.047 --> 30:47.164
in all likelihood,
they would never leave Earth...

30:59.767 --> 31:00.882
T'Mir.

31:01.167 --> 31:04.159
This is Captain Tellus
of the Vulcan survey vessel D'Vahl.

31:04.287 --> 31:06.960
I'm responding to your distress signal.

31:07.967 --> 31:09.923
We thought it wasn't transmitted.

31:10.047 --> 31:12.720
Your signal was received
by a Tellarite freighter.

31:12.847 --> 31:15.884
It took them some time to forward it
to the High Command.

31:16.007 --> 31:17.759
We're approaching the system now.

31:17.887 --> 31:20.117
Meet us at the crash site in three days.

31:20.247 --> 31:21.600
Understood.

31:40.087 --> 31:41.884
I hear you're leaving.

31:43.087 --> 31:44.600
That's correct.

31:46.607 --> 31:47.835
Where to?

31:49.087 --> 31:50.122
Home.

31:51.727 --> 31:52.955
Up north.

31:56.807 --> 31:58.479
I'm gonna miss you.

31:59.207 --> 32:02.165
You're about the most interesting
people I've met in this town.

32:02.287 --> 32:06.041
I'm sure you'll meet a lot
of interesting people at college.

32:07.687 --> 32:09.120
I'm not going.

32:10.047 --> 32:12.242
What? Why not?

32:12.367 --> 32:14.437
We couldn't come up with
the rest of the money.

32:14.567 --> 32:17.081
The deadline
for the tuition is Friday, so...

32:17.887 --> 32:19.206
What will you do?

32:19.327 --> 32:21.079
Keep saving, I guess.

32:22.047 --> 32:23.196
Find a job.

32:23.327 --> 32:25.682
Mum doesn't want me
anywhere near the mine...

32:25.807 --> 32:28.082
but that's where
the work is around here.

32:28.207 --> 32:30.767
Can you try again next year
for the scholarship?

32:30.887 --> 32:32.525
I'll reapply, but there's no guarantee.

32:34.127 --> 32:36.880
I'm sure they will offer it to you again.

32:38.407 --> 32:40.841
And if not, there's always the library.

32:40.967 --> 32:43.037
Still a lot of books I haven't read.

32:44.567 --> 32:46.239
Good luck up north.

32:47.007 --> 32:50.886
Carbon Creek's
not exactly a vacation spot...

32:51.327 --> 32:53.283
but I hope you'll come visit us.

32:53.407 --> 32:54.601
Perhaps.

33:05.207 --> 33:07.357
He took those college boards.

33:07.887 --> 33:10.924
Got the highest score
of anybody in the county.

33:11.927 --> 33:13.406
It's not fair.

34:24.487 --> 34:29.242
So, you're the lady with the invention
that's going to change the world.

35:09.167 --> 35:10.395
Morning.

35:17.047 --> 35:18.002
Jack!

35:21.247 --> 35:22.202
Jack!

35:29.447 --> 35:32.325
- Didn't you terminate your employment?
- Yes.

35:33.767 --> 35:36.486
But I promised Mrs. Garrett
I'd repair this suction device.

35:36.607 --> 35:39.041
It's unfortunate
that you'll be leaving these people...

35:39.167 --> 35:41.635
without experiencing one thing
they have to offer.

35:42.487 --> 35:46.162
Such as? Alcohol? Frozen fish sticks?

35:46.527 --> 35:49.200
The constant threat
of nuclear annihilation?

35:49.327 --> 35:53.240
There is much more to them.
You just refuse to see it.

35:53.527 --> 35:55.119
I've seen enough.

35:55.727 --> 35:57.046
I haven't.

35:57.567 --> 35:59.285
I plan to stay here.

36:00.927 --> 36:02.997
If this is your attempt at humour...

36:03.127 --> 36:07.279
They're on the verge of countless
social and technological advancements.

36:07.887 --> 36:10.924
I have the unique opportunity
to study an emerging species.

36:11.047 --> 36:14.642
That's what you've done,
much closer than we anticipated.

36:15.487 --> 36:18.638
Your duty is to return to Vulcan
and report your findings.

36:18.767 --> 36:21.361
There's still more to learn
about these people.

36:21.487 --> 36:23.443
All of them or just one?

36:24.967 --> 36:27.401
This has nothing to do with Maggie.

36:27.807 --> 36:30.765
She has helped me
appreciate their culture...

36:31.327 --> 36:33.795
but I don't intend
to remain in Carbon Creek.

36:33.927 --> 36:35.280
Where would you go?

36:35.407 --> 36:39.116
To one of their larger cities, at first.
After that, I'm not certain.

36:41.127 --> 36:43.004
There's so much to see.

36:43.127 --> 36:45.687
The High Command will never allow it.

36:46.967 --> 36:49.003
Tell him it's not possible.

36:51.447 --> 36:52.562
T'Mir?

36:54.887 --> 36:58.596
Perhaps I can arrange for you
to be on the next survey ship.

36:58.727 --> 37:00.160
In another 20 years...

37:00.287 --> 37:03.279
running more statistical scans
from high orbit?

37:05.207 --> 37:06.845
That's not enough.

37:26.367 --> 37:27.561
Where is your captain?

37:27.687 --> 37:29.325
He was killed in the crash.

37:29.447 --> 37:31.517
There were four Vulcans
aboard your vessel.

37:31.647 --> 37:35.640
Mestral died in the crash as well.
We cremated their remains.

38:06.767 --> 38:09.486
Do you realise you've just
rewritten our history books?

38:09.607 --> 38:11.325
A footnote, at best.

38:11.607 --> 38:12.881
Footnote?

38:13.367 --> 38:14.482
This is like finding out...

38:14.607 --> 38:17.246
Neil Armstrong wasn't the first man
to walk on the moon.

38:17.367 --> 38:19.039
Perhaps he wasn't.

38:21.007 --> 38:24.761
How long did this Mestral stay on Earth?

38:25.047 --> 38:26.924
The rest of his life, presumably.

38:27.047 --> 38:30.881
And that would be what,
another 100, 150 years?

38:31.127 --> 38:32.685
Possibly longer.

38:33.967 --> 38:36.606
An alien is left on Earth in the 1950s...

38:36.727 --> 38:40.117
lives through, what, 30 presidents,
travels the world...

38:40.247 --> 38:42.044
and no one notices him?

38:42.167 --> 38:44.442
What happened when he finally
kicked the bucket?

38:44.567 --> 38:47.718
Did the undertaker
just shrug and ignore his ears?

38:48.927 --> 38:51.282
You asked me to tell you a story.

38:51.687 --> 38:53.359
And it was a good one.

38:54.327 --> 38:56.283
But did it really happen?

38:56.407 --> 39:00.116
As I said,
you asked me to tell you a story.

39:03.447 --> 39:04.926
Damn, Captain.

39:05.407 --> 39:07.284
She put one over on us.

39:07.407 --> 39:09.443
You did go to Carbon Creek.

39:09.647 --> 39:11.603
If you check my record, you'll note...

39:11.727 --> 39:15.515
that I also visited Yellowstone Park
and the Carlsbad Caverns.

39:16.007 --> 39:18.680
I'm a scientist. That includes geology.

39:22.327 --> 39:23.555
Thank you for the meal.

39:23.687 --> 39:25.086
My pleasure.

39:25.447 --> 39:28.405
You've certainly kept us entertained.

39:30.047 --> 39:31.400
Good night.

39:32.305 --> 39:38.466
