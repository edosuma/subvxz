WEBVTT

00:02.882 --> 00:03.687
Previously on Damages:

00:03.689 --> 00:06.743
I've been sitting at that
table all night hoping to get you alone.

00:06.811 --> 00:08.886
Opportunity doesn't always knock
twice.

00:08.954 --> 00:10.230
I'll take my chances.

00:10.231 --> 00:12.272
Why haven't you interviewed any
possible associates?

00:12.340 --> 00:14.476
There's only one
candidate who seems promising.

00:14.544 --> 00:16.047
Her name is Alex Benjamin.

00:16.049 --> 00:18.051
Maybe the world
needs people like Patty Hewes,

00:18.120 --> 00:20.259
but that doesn't mean that you
should go work for her.

00:20.327 --> 00:22.968
I don't understand. We never
invested with Louis Tobin.

00:23.035 --> 00:25.710
We gave our money to
Leverett and Leverett gave it to Tobin.

00:25.778 --> 00:26.814
We've lost everything.

00:26.815 --> 00:28.753
Did you know Dad was
gonna leave this behind?

00:28.821 --> 00:29.822
It explains where the money is.

00:29.823 --> 00:32.162
There's a name in there.
Stuart Zedeck.

00:32.229 --> 00:33.832
We'd like to start
making transactions.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.637
I'm afraid that's not
possible 'cause Mr. Zedeck

00:35.638 --> 00:37.408
is no longer comfortable with
the arrangement.

00:37.409 --> 00:39.867
Tell me the truth
about Danielle Marchetti.

00:39.934 --> 00:41.513
Louis had a child
with her.

00:41.514 --> 00:44.210
Yes. Do you know where
that child is now?

00:44.278 --> 00:46.163
The night he died,
I went to the apartment

00:46.164 --> 00:48.064
and I found that on the
coffee table near his body.

00:48.117 --> 00:50.478
Dr. Brandt, he made
the mix for Dad.

00:50.545 --> 00:52.882
Carol, I am really
sorry for your family.

00:55.152 --> 00:57.155
Ms. Marchetti?

00:59.460 --> 01:03.800
Roger wants to know what we think
of sending Megan to public school.

01:03.868 --> 01:06.572
No, that's not an
expense we want to cut.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.509
Well, how about the
lake house?

01:08.510 --> 01:12.180
You mean sell it?

01:12.248 --> 01:13.649
Tom makes a good living.

01:13.650 --> 01:16.120
I really don't see why we're
panicking.

01:16.188 --> 01:19.225
We're not panicking.
We're trying to be prudent.

01:19.292 --> 01:20.759
Are we?

01:20.760 --> 01:22.682
I have to say that
given the amount of financial

01:22.750 --> 01:24.946
assistance that you were
providing for both of your

01:25.014 --> 01:28.135
families, my advice would be to
make some changes.

01:28.203 --> 01:29.602
Well, I talked to my
mom.

01:29.603 --> 01:31.271
My folks are willing to cut
back.

01:31.272 --> 01:33.307
That's not gonna be
enough, all right.

01:33.374 --> 01:36.744
The Tobins have totally wiped
out our financial security.

01:36.812 --> 01:39.214
Not if you and Patty
recover more of the Tobin's funds.

01:39.281 --> 01:40.549
Don't count on that.

01:40.550 --> 01:42.184
What about Eric
Nichols?

01:42.185 --> 01:43.251
Deb.

01:43.252 --> 01:44.186
What?

01:44.187 --> 01:46.655
I don't know who
that is.

01:46.723 --> 01:48.958
Eric Nichols was our
financial advisor.

01:49.025 --> 01:51.061
He's the guy who got us all in
on the Ponzi scheme.

01:51.128 --> 01:53.697
He's a criminal.
He didn't do his due diligence.

01:53.764 --> 01:55.432
His kid goes to
Megan's school.

01:55.433 --> 01:56.933
Well, why can't we sue
him?

01:56.934 --> 01:57.934
Because...

01:57.935 --> 01:58.768
What?

01:58.769 --> 01:59.569
There's no evidence.

01:59.570 --> 02:00.937
Just stay clear of
him.

02:00.938 --> 02:04.808
There may be a way to litigate later
on, but for now just leave him alone.

02:04.876 --> 02:08.745
Going after Eric Nichols
is not the solution to our problem.

02:08.812 --> 02:11.548
We have to sell assets, we have
to cut costs.

02:11.615 --> 02:15.152
That's the only way we're gonna
save our family.

02:25.230 --> 02:27.799
Sorry, she's not handling it
well.

02:27.866 --> 02:30.535
Well, who would.

02:34.473 --> 02:40.212
Tom, you're gonna have to tell
Patty about this sooner or later.

02:40.279 --> 02:42.547
I know.

02:50.791 --> 02:54.662
I understand it was
quite a nasty car accident.

02:54.729 --> 02:58.561
Have you found out who
hit me?

02:58.629 --> 03:03.566
Do you think this
could've been done to you on purpose?

03:04.902 --> 03:10.306
Hey, Vic, what are
you doing out here?

03:10.373 --> 03:13.609
I, uh, I think
better in the cold.

03:13.676 --> 03:16.378
I think
better on the can.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.914
I just had a breakthrough.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.649
Yeah?

03:20.650 --> 03:23.485
Don't know how we
missed it.

03:23.552 --> 03:25.452
Missed what?

03:25.487 --> 03:27.488
Tom Shayes' time of
death.

03:27.556 --> 03:32.259
The M.E. report said he was dead
almost three hours when we found him.

03:32.327 --> 03:33.394
So?

03:33.395 --> 03:37.965
Well, Patty Hewes was hit
by Shayes' car two hours before that.

03:38.032 --> 03:42.002
See what I'm getting at?

03:42.070 --> 03:43.203
No.

03:43.204 --> 03:45.405
And no math, Milt.

03:45.473 --> 03:51.344
I'm saying
there's an extra two hours.

03:51.411 --> 03:52.478
So, Shayes could've

03:52.479 --> 03:53.579
been the other driver?

03:53.580 --> 03:54.547
Yeah.

03:54.548 --> 03:56.548
He could've hit Patty.

04:00.542 --> 04:06.340
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

04:42.000 --> 04:44.001
We're processing over 5,000
claims from investors that

04:44.068 --> 04:45.469
Louis Tobin has defrauded.

04:45.470 --> 04:48.705
We've liquidated all the
family's assets and holdings.

04:48.773 --> 04:50.540
I've read you
recent filing with the court.

04:50.541 --> 04:54.244
I know all the low-hanging fruit
has been plucked. t what's next?

04:54.310 --> 04:58.281
Well, it's a
complicated case, Your Honor.

04:58.349 --> 05:03.453
I'm sure you understand the difficulties
of recovering additional funds.

05:03.521 --> 05:06.923
You've always been
up front with me, Patty.

05:06.991 --> 05:08.424
I owe the same to you.

05:08.425 --> 05:10.927
Please, speak freely.

05:10.994 --> 05:14.230
People are losing
confidence in you.

05:14.297 --> 05:17.099
They don't see progress.

05:17.166 --> 05:21.735
Your investigation seems to be focused
on hidden funds that may not even exist.

05:21.803 --> 05:24.504
You know I have faith in you,
Patty.

05:24.572 --> 05:27.340
That's why I recommended your
appointment as trustee in this case.

05:27.408 --> 05:28.541
And I'm grateful.

05:28.542 --> 05:30.943
Forget grateful.
It wasn't a favor.

05:31.011 --> 05:33.012
No one's more capable than you,

05:33.079 --> 05:34.914
but without results, I don't

05:34.915 --> 05:39.618
know how long I can
keep the wolves at bay.

05:39.686 --> 05:45.958
If you don't recover more funds
soon, I may have to replace you.

05:46.025 --> 05:49.694
Thank you for giving
me the heads up.

05:49.761 --> 05:51.995
New candidate for the associate's
position's been calling.

05:52.063 --> 05:53.563
She wants to know
if she's hired.

05:53.564 --> 05:55.365
I can't think about
her right now.

05:55.366 --> 05:57.634
Tell me about Danielle
Marchetti's daughter.

05:57.701 --> 05:59.401
We tracked down her
birth certificate.

05:59.402 --> 06:01.568
She was born at Maimonides
Hospital in Brooklyn.

06:01.635 --> 06:03.135
Who's listed as the
father?

06:03.136 --> 06:04.666
No one.
Unknown.

06:04.667 --> 06:07.099
Maybe Marilyn Tobin was telling
the truth.

06:07.167 --> 06:10.096
Louis was just covering up his
illegitimate child.

06:10.163 --> 06:15.762
No. Something else must've
happened on Thanksgiving.

06:15.830 --> 06:21.667
Well, we better find out quick
before Judge Reilly cuts us off.

06:21.735 --> 06:22.968
I'll be back.

06:22.969 --> 06:24.269
Where you going?

06:24.270 --> 06:26.838
To see an old friend.

06:26.905 --> 06:29.707
The initial M.E.
report on Danielle Marchetti.

06:29.774 --> 06:32.876
He says she died of heart
failure.

06:32.944 --> 06:34.178
Same as Louis Tobin.

06:34.179 --> 06:37.049
There's gotta be a
connection between the two.

06:37.116 --> 06:38.884
Well, Danielle
Marchetti had a history of

06:38.885 --> 06:42.187
substance abuse and she was also
recovering from brain surgery.

06:42.254 --> 06:44.154
And Tobin had a history
of heart problems, so I

06:44.189 --> 06:47.557
guess, on the surface, natural
causes are a possibility.

06:47.625 --> 06:49.558
But you don't
believe in coincidences.

06:49.626 --> 06:50.593
No, I don't.

06:50.594 --> 06:54.896
Could be somebody wanted them
both dead.

06:54.964 --> 06:56.597
We got any suspects?

06:56.598 --> 06:58.599
For Marchetti, I would
say the Tobin family, but she

06:58.668 --> 07:00.000
pled the Fifth at her deposition

07:00.001 --> 07:02.202
so they wouldn't be worried she
was gonna give them up.

07:02.272 --> 07:04.037
Any suspects for
Tobin?

07:04.038 --> 07:04.770
Thousands of them.

07:04.771 --> 07:05.971
The investors.

07:05.972 --> 07:08.742
Yeah, but one in
particular- Richard Renfro.

07:08.809 --> 07:11.177
The guy who Joe Tobin assaulted.

07:11.244 --> 07:13.611
He never pressed charges,
that always felt wrong to me.

07:13.679 --> 07:15.913
Look into it?

07:15.981 --> 07:18.549
So, this is an
official inquiry.

07:18.616 --> 07:21.718
Yes, I want you to
head it up.

07:27.624 --> 07:30.559
I want you to take this with
you when you meet Zedeck.

07:30.626 --> 07:31.827
What, are you serious?

07:31.828 --> 07:34.228
Just keep it in
your coat pocket.

07:34.296 --> 07:35.096
Where did you...

07:35.097 --> 07:36.997
I don't want it.

07:38.100 --> 07:42.069
Joe, this man had Danielle killed and
he only wants to meet you alone.

07:42.137 --> 07:43.537
That worries me.

07:43.538 --> 07:45.706
What, what did you find
out about him?

07:45.773 --> 07:46.706
Not much.

07:46.707 --> 07:48.341
He owns a couple of dry cleaners

07:48.342 --> 07:50.443
and he grew up in the same
neighborhood as your father.

07:50.510 --> 07:52.111
When does he want to
meet?

07:52.112 --> 07:53.179
Tonight at 11:00.

07:53.180 --> 07:55.681
F train to Queens.

07:55.749 --> 08:00.918
You're supposed to stay on the
train till the last stop.

08:00.986 --> 08:02.153
Then what?

08:02.154 --> 08:04.021
He says you'll know
what to do when you get there.

08:04.022 --> 08:05.522
What the hell does that
mean?

08:05.523 --> 08:06.389
Who knows?

08:06.390 --> 08:08.490
Why do you think I'm nervous?

08:11.527 --> 08:14.662
Joe, you don't have to do
this, you know.

08:16.698 --> 08:18.365
Yes, I do.

08:18.366 --> 08:20.533
I wanna meet this guy.

08:27.773 --> 08:30.174
I'll call you.

08:39.750 --> 08:43.219
Hello, Sterling.

08:43.285 --> 08:46.088
It's nice to see
you, Patty.

08:47.590 --> 08:54.828
Truth be told, he most exhilarating year
of my life was your trial against me.

08:54.896 --> 08:56.563
I cherish the memory.

08:56.564 --> 08:58.231
I just loved

08:58.232 --> 09:00.166
watching you do your thing

09:00.233 --> 09:02.234
and I've kept tabs on you.

09:02.302 --> 09:04.870
I know about your divorce.

09:04.937 --> 09:06.471
Sorry about that.

09:06.472 --> 09:07.938
Oh, don't be.

09:07.939 --> 09:10.440
Change is good.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.577
Speaking of which, I want to ask

09:13.644 --> 09:14.911
you something.

09:14.912 --> 09:16.613
Hmm?

09:16.614 --> 09:18.348
I'm thinking of

09:18.349 --> 09:19.716
remodeling.

09:19.717 --> 09:22.084
It's a good idea.

09:22.152 --> 09:24.887
Marriages leave ghosts.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.154
When we came to arrest

09:26.155 --> 09:28.289
you, I remember seeing your

09:28.357 --> 09:29.924
offices.

09:29.925 --> 09:31.358
They were beautiful.

09:31.359 --> 09:33.726
Warm, unpretentious.

09:33.794 --> 09:35.694
Who was your architect?

09:35.695 --> 09:38.262
I'll get you the
name.

09:38.330 --> 09:41.564
But you're not here to discuss

09:41.632 --> 09:43.833
interior design.

09:43.901 --> 09:45.835
No.

09:45.902 --> 09:47.770
Let me guess.

09:47.771 --> 09:49.171
You wanna pick my brain about

09:49.172 --> 09:50.939
Louis Tobin.

09:50.940 --> 09:51.773
I believe he tucked

09:51.774 --> 09:53.440
away a fortune.

09:53.441 --> 09:55.609
If anyone knows how to hide

09:55.676 --> 09:58.812
money, it's you.

09:58.880 --> 10:00.147
What am I, your

10:00.148 --> 10:02.319
Hannibal Lecter?

10:02.387 --> 10:03.153
How would Tobin have

10:03.154 --> 10:04.757
done it?

10:04.758 --> 10:05.859
I mean, he must've had help, a

10:05.860 --> 10:07.831
partner in crime.

10:07.899 --> 10:10.605
Patty, don't waste

10:10.673 --> 10:11.873
your time.

10:11.874 --> 10:13.975
You're not looking for a person.

10:14.043 --> 10:16.811
What am I looking for?

10:16.879 --> 10:19.180
A government.

10:19.247 --> 10:23.884
Go on.

10:23.952 --> 10:27.420
Well, the rest is

10:27.487 --> 10:29.421
gonna cost you, you know.

10:29.489 --> 10:31.490
Quid pro quo.

10:36.162 --> 10:39.564
Name your terms.

10:39.631 --> 10:40.765
I was thinking

10:40.766 --> 10:44.067
maybe a, uh, conjugal visit

10:44.135 --> 10:47.170
would do the trick.

10:51.641 --> 10:53.108
Alex, thanks for

10:53.109 --> 10:54.276
coming.

10:54.277 --> 10:55.509
My pleasure.

10:55.510 --> 10:57.543
Take a seat.

10:57.610 --> 11:00.045
You know, to be honest,

11:00.112 --> 11:01.680
I listened to your message maybe

11:01.681 --> 11:03.181
five times trying to figure out

11:03.182 --> 11:04.548
whether you were bringing me

11:04.549 --> 11:06.149
back for good news or bad news.

11:06.150 --> 11:07.982
I have an assignment

11:07.983 --> 11:09.016
for you.

11:09.017 --> 11:10.082
Excellent.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.577
Does that mean I'm hired?

11:12.645 --> 11:14.474
Depends.

11:14.475 --> 11:16.973
How badly do you want the job?

11:17.040 --> 11:19.942
Pretty badly.

11:20.009 --> 11:23.044
This is...

11:23.112 --> 11:24.612
an unusual task.

11:24.613 --> 11:27.048
Whatever you need.

11:27.115 --> 11:31.051
Have you ever been
to prison?

11:59.846 --> 12:02.681
Last stop, Jamaica,

12:02.749 --> 12:03.883
179th Street.

12:03.884 --> 12:05.851
Last stop.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.667
Hey.

12:30.668 --> 12:31.734
Jesus!

12:31.735 --> 12:33.202
You made it.

12:33.203 --> 12:34.437
Stand up.

12:34.438 --> 12:34.971
What?

12:34.972 --> 12:35.437
Come on.

12:35.438 --> 12:36.605
What the hell you doing?

12:36.606 --> 12:37.907
I'm gonna check for a wire.

12:37.908 --> 12:38.775
No, don't touch me!

12:38.776 --> 12:41.377
Enough! Enough,
enough!

12:41.444 --> 12:43.145
Relax, Ben.

12:43.146 --> 12:44.913
His father trusted me,

12:44.914 --> 12:47.481
and I trusted him.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.083
And I extend the same respect

12:49.084 --> 12:50.117
to y.

12:50.118 --> 12:53.153
You don't remember me, do you?

12:53.220 --> 12:56.054
No, no, I don't.

12:56.122 --> 12:58.157
How's your mother holding up?

12:58.224 --> 13:02.494
How do you think?

13:02.562 --> 13:04.496
Your father and I

13:04.563 --> 13:06.230
go back a long way.

13:06.231 --> 13:08.132
And it always meant a lot to him

13:08.200 --> 13:10.067
that he could buy your mother

13:10.068 --> 13:11.769
the finest things.

13:11.770 --> 13:13.670
It must be very hard for her now

13:13.671 --> 13:15.271
without the vacations and the

13:15.272 --> 13:17.039
furs.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.974
Marilyn always loved her mink.

13:19.042 --> 13:22.010
Look, Mr. Zedeck, my

13:22.078 --> 13:24.245
father told me about the money.

13:24.313 --> 13:25.813
Okay?

13:25.814 --> 13:27.481
He left me information.

13:27.482 --> 13:29.416
Yeah, well, you

13:29.484 --> 13:30.985
weren't supposed to be part of

13:30.986 --> 13:31.920
this yet.

13:31.921 --> 13:33.354
Well, he wasn't supposed

13:33.355 --> 13:34.622
to be dead, but he is.

13:34.623 --> 13:36.557
Right?

13:36.625 --> 13:37.958
I guess that makes

13:37.959 --> 13:38.959
you and I partners.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.193
No, that makes you and

13:40.194 --> 13:41.193
I nothing.

13:41.194 --> 13:42.561
Okay?

13:42.562 --> 13:44.195
If you want me to go along with

13:44.196 --> 13:46.197
you, I need proof you can

13:46.264 --> 13:47.831
produce.

13:47.832 --> 13:49.666
What kind of proof?

13:49.667 --> 13:51.499
Money.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.434
That you have access to it.

13:54.502 --> 13:56.169
It's not a smart time

13:56.170 --> 13:57.170
for that.

13:57.171 --> 13:58.170
I don't care.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.171
Do it.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.405
Or I turn over everything my

14:00.406 --> 14:01.439
father gave me to the

14:01.440 --> 14:02.442
authorities.

14:02.443 --> 14:03.444
Ah, take it easy.

14:03.445 --> 14:04.480
No, you take it easy.

14:04.481 --> 14:05.314
You don't have to...

14:05.315 --> 14:06.315
No, no.

14:06.316 --> 14:08.918
I understand your concerns, Joe.

14:08.986 --> 14:10.920
I'll see what I can do.

14:10.988 --> 14:12.989
This train leaves back to the

14:13.057 --> 14:14.991
city now.

14:15.059 --> 14:18.060
I'll be in touch.

14:26.564 --> 14:27.563
You have to go to

14:27.564 --> 14:28.263
school with Megan?

14:28.264 --> 14:29.131
Yeah, it's parent's

14:29.132 --> 14:29.631
day.

14:29.632 --> 14:31.265
Once a year, you sit in on their

14:31.266 --> 14:32.166
classes, have lunch with your

14:32.167 --> 14:32.700
kid.

14:32.701 --> 14:34.368
I'm sure Michael's school must

14:34.369 --> 14:35.535
have had the same thing.

14:35.536 --> 14:36.869
If they did, he never

14:36.870 --> 14:38.037
told me about it.

14:38.038 --> 14:39.705
Anyway, I have to

14:39.706 --> 14:41.039
give a speech to Megan's class.

14:41.040 --> 14:42.874
Speech about what?

14:42.875 --> 14:44.207
Oh, what it's like

14:44.208 --> 14:45.375
to be a lawyer.

14:45.376 --> 14:46.576
Ooh, the 13 year olds

14:46.577 --> 14:47.877
will be riveted.

14:47.878 --> 14:48.911
I know it's bad

14:48.912 --> 14:49.611
timing, but...

14:49.612 --> 14:50.445
No, no, no.

14:50.446 --> 14:51.679
Do what you have to do.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.682
Enjoy it.

14:57.051 --> 14:58.084
This is who Gates

14:58.085 --> 14:58.785
was talking about?

14:58.786 --> 14:59.485
Yeah, Richard

14:59.486 --> 15:00.486
Renfro.

15:00.487 --> 15:01.721
Lost almost 2 million in Louis

15:01.722 --> 15:02.988
Tobin's Ponzi scheme, then he

15:02.989 --> 15:04.657
shot his mouth off to the press.

15:04.658 --> 15:05.658
What'd he say?

15:05.659 --> 15:06.692
Renfro told The New

15:06.693 --> 15:08.361
York Times, quote, "Somebody

15:08.362 --> 15:10.531
should do society a favor and

15:10.599 --> 15:13.330
slit the old man's throat.

15:13.398 --> 15:15.331
Louis Tobin needs to suffer.

15:15.399 --> 15:17.232
I want the man to bleed."

15:17.233 --> 15:19.200
Sounds like we got
a person of interest.

15:19.268 --> 15:21.468
Maybe, but if he
hated the Tobins so much, why

15:21.536 --> 15:23.504
didn't he press charges when
Joe Tobin assaulted him?

15:23.572 --> 15:24.607
See, I don't know.

15:24.608 --> 15:28.711
We tried to reach out, but he won't
talk without his attorney present.

15:28.779 --> 15:30.111
Who's his attorney?

15:30.112 --> 15:33.120
Patty Hewes.

15:34.691 --> 15:37.459
I'll see what I can
do.

15:43.065 --> 15:44.999
Fun stuff, huh?

15:45.067 --> 15:46.900
Which one's yours?

15:46.901 --> 15:47.901
Trumpet.

15:47.902 --> 15:50.336
First chair.

15:50.404 --> 15:53.338
Name a bigger waste of time.

15:53.406 --> 15:55.339
I'm sorry, but I don't think

15:55.407 --> 15:57.340
we've met.

15:57.408 --> 15:58.741
Oh, Eric Nichols.

15:58.742 --> 16:00.242
Investment advisor.

16:00.243 --> 16:03.244
Let me give you my card.

16:08.215 --> 16:09.215
Biddle!

16:09.216 --> 16:12.219
Your visitor's here.

16:21.596 --> 16:23.264
Please.

16:23.265 --> 16:26.035
Yes, Patty always had an eye for

16:26.103 --> 16:29.106
the pretty ones.

16:32.844 --> 16:34.779
I hope you're okay with this.

16:34.846 --> 16:36.180
I'm fine,

16:36.181 --> 16:39.183
Mr. Biddle.

16:42.187 --> 16:45.189
Well, then, uh...

17:00.171 --> 17:03.841
Joe Tobin, uh, gave me a black
eye and he busted my nose.

17:03.909 --> 17:05.409
Why didn't you

17:05.410 --> 17:07.344
press charges?

17:07.412 --> 17:09.246
Uh...

17:09.247 --> 17:11.949
Did you intend to take
matters into your own hands?

17:12.017 --> 17:13.017
No.

17:13.018 --> 17:14.017
No, not at all.

17:14.018 --> 17:16.619
Listen, guys, I was wrong.

17:16.688 --> 17:19.622
And I got mad, I lost control.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.523
I mean, the truth is that, um,

17:21.525 --> 17:23.192
well, I provoked Tobin and he

17:23.193 --> 17:24.694
decked me.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.029
I- I probably deserved it.

17:26.030 --> 17:28.231
Where were you on the
night of Louis Tobin's death?

17:28.299 --> 17:30.233
I was with my in-laws

17:30.300 --> 17:31.968
in Syracuse.

17:31.969 --> 17:34.070
Mr. Renfro has
witnesses and credit card

17:34.137 --> 17:36.072
receipts to verify his
whereabouts.

17:36.139 --> 17:38.341
You're welcome to check
everything out.

17:38.408 --> 17:41.344
We intend to.

17:41.412 --> 17:43.346
Uh, thank you, Mr.

17:43.414 --> 17:44.113
Renfro.

17:44.114 --> 17:44.814
Sure.

17:44.815 --> 17:45.648
We'll- uh, we'll

17:45.649 --> 17:46.649
be in touch.

17:46.650 --> 17:47.649
Thank you.

17:47.650 --> 17:49.684
Thanks.

17:49.685 --> 17:50.918
Ellen, do you have a

17:50.919 --> 17:52.853
minute?

17:52.921 --> 17:53.920
Uh, sure.

17:53.921 --> 17:54.954
We'll wait for you

17:54.955 --> 17:56.954
by reception.

17:58.956 --> 17:59.989
Why are you wasting

17:59.990 --> 18:01.922
my time?

18:01.988 --> 18:03.888
What do you mean?

18:03.921 --> 18:05.150
You just brought two

18:05.151 --> 18:06.883
lightweights into my office.

18:06.884 --> 18:08.781
We both know Louis Tobin wasn't

18:08.782 --> 18:09.779
a homicide.

18:09.780 --> 18:10.811
I'm just doing my

18:10.812 --> 18:12.075
job.

18:12.076 --> 18:13.409
My boss needs to put someone

18:13.410 --> 18:14.643
in jail and he's not getting

18:14.644 --> 18:15.644
anywhere.

18:15.645 --> 18:16.978
Ooh.

18:16.979 --> 18:18.012
That's a problem, isn't it?

18:18.013 --> 18:19.013
You made him

18:19.014 --> 18:20.048
desperate when you got Danielle

18:20.049 --> 18:21.883
Marchetti to plead the Fifth.

18:21.884 --> 18:23.385
I'm just trying to

18:23.386 --> 18:25.321
find the Tobins' money, Ellen.

18:25.389 --> 18:28.391
And I hope you do.

18:30.327 --> 18:31.560
What did you think of

18:31.561 --> 18:34.496
Alex Benjamin?

18:34.564 --> 18:37.098
I think... she's

18:37.166 --> 18:38.432
just what you're looking for.

18:38.433 --> 18:39.934
Really?

18:39.935 --> 18:41.602
In what way?

18:41.603 --> 18:43.237
She's smart,

18:43.238 --> 18:45.840
ambitious, very dedicated.

18:45.908 --> 18:48.842
She'll fit right in.

18:48.910 --> 18:50.844
I'm glad you like her.

18:50.912 --> 18:54.947
I didn't say I
liked her.

18:59.528 --> 19:00.562
This is my dad.

19:00.563 --> 19:05.200
His name is Thomas and he is
a lawyer.

19:05.267 --> 19:07.167
Thanks, Megan.

19:09.270 --> 19:11.237
That's right.
I'm a- I'm a lawyer.

19:11.304 --> 19:12.971
Does anyone here know what a

19:12.972 --> 19:15.907
lawyer does?

19:15.975 --> 19:17.642
What's your name?

19:17.643 --> 19:19.644
Charlotte.

19:19.645 --> 19:21.312
What does a lawyer do?

19:21.313 --> 19:23.913
They handle
divorces.

19:23.981 --> 19:28.149
So your daddy can marry someone
else.

19:28.217 --> 19:30.151
Uh, you're right.

19:30.219 --> 19:31.552
Yes, they do.

19:31.553 --> 19:33.453
They-they handle divorces.

19:34.556 --> 19:36.723
Anybody else know
what a lawyer does?

19:36.791 --> 19:38.724
Young sir.

19:38.792 --> 19:40.726
IPOs.

19:40.793 --> 19:42.293
SHAYES Yes.

19:42.294 --> 19:43.294
Yeah, that's right.

19:43.295 --> 19:44.961
They handle- they handle IPOs.

19:44.962 --> 19:47.230
Very good.

19:47.297 --> 19:50.465
Looks like you've all had some
experience with lawyers.

19:50.533 --> 19:52.902
Or at least your parents have.
Let me ask you this.

19:52.970 --> 19:57.206
Why do you think people become
lawyers?

19:58.441 --> 19:59.875
I mean, if doctors want to save

19:59.876 --> 20:01.543
lives and teachers want to

20:01.544 --> 20:05.279
teach... uh, why do lawyers go

20:05.347 --> 20:08.348
into law?

20:11.418 --> 20:13.686
Well, let me just tell you why,

20:13.753 --> 20:15.253
uh, I became a lawyer.

20:15.254 --> 20:17.488
I came from a-a big Irish
Catholic family.

20:17.556 --> 20:18.888
Five brothers and sisters,

20:18.889 --> 20:21.491
uncles, aunts, cousins, passing

20:21.559 --> 20:23.526
through all the time.

20:23.593 --> 20:25.093
And if there were no rules, uh,

20:25.094 --> 20:26.628
it would've been- it would've

20:26.629 --> 20:29.563
been chaos.

20:29.631 --> 20:32.598
Rules are why there were still

20:32.666 --> 20:34.900
mashed potatoes on the plate by

20:34.968 --> 20:36.802
the time it was passed to me.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.239
So, I-I respect rules.

20:39.307 --> 20:41.575
I- that's what- and that's
what laws are.

20:41.642 --> 20:42.642
They're just rules.

20:42.643 --> 20:46.611
They're there to protect people
who need protection.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.946
Because there are a lot of big

20:49.014 --> 20:52.950
brothers out there who, uh...

20:53.017 --> 20:55.451
who want to steal your mashed

20:55.519 --> 20:58.520
potatoes.

21:03.492 --> 21:06.427
Anyway, um...

21:08.163 --> 21:09.496
Thank you.

21:09.497 --> 21:10.831
I have an Alex Benjamin at

21:10.832 --> 21:12.499
reception.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.434
Yes, Mrs. Hewes, I understand.

21:15.502 --> 21:16.836
I'm sorry, she can't see you.

21:16.837 --> 21:17.836
Oh, that's okay.

21:17.837 --> 21:18.837
I can wait.

21:18.838 --> 21:20.339
She asked for you to go.

21:20.340 --> 21:21.840
Excuse me?

21:21.841 --> 21:23.508
She said she'll be busy for

21:23.509 --> 21:26.511
some time.

21:30.482 --> 21:31.481
Hewes, Shayes & Associates.

21:31.482 --> 21:34.484
How may I direct your call?

21:44.293 --> 21:46.127
Hello?

21:46.128 --> 21:48.496
117 Street and First Avenue.

21:48.563 --> 21:50.130
What about it?

21:50.131 --> 21:52.131
Get yourself there.

21:54.134 --> 21:55.334
What about Renfro?

21:55.335 --> 21:56.502
Oh, his alibi

21:56.503 --> 21:57.102
checks out.

21:57.103 --> 21:58.203
He didn't have anything to do

21:58.204 --> 21:58.837
with Tobin's death.

21:58.838 --> 21:59.671
Of course not,

21:59.672 --> 22:00.705
because it wasn't a homicide.

22:00.706 --> 22:01.939
Tobin killed himself.

22:01.940 --> 22:03.840
You think he, uh,

22:03.875 --> 22:05.441
induced his own heart attack?

22:05.442 --> 22:07.342
It's possible.

22:07.379 --> 22:08.180
The guy'sot a

22:08.181 --> 22:09.182
chemist, you know.

22:09.183 --> 22:10.282
He would have needed some help.

22:10.283 --> 22:11.250
The night that Tobin

22:11.251 --> 22:12.418
died, he was visited by the

22:12.419 --> 22:14.019
family doctor.

22:14.020 --> 22:16.387
Yup, Karl Brandt.

22:16.455 --> 22:17.288
How do you know

22:17.289 --> 22:17.789
that?

22:17.790 --> 22:18.691
'Cause all visitors

22:18.692 --> 22:19.692
had to sign in with federal

22:19.693 --> 22:20.426
marshals.

22:20.427 --> 22:21.927
Supposedly, Brandt

22:21.928 --> 22:23.062
was there to give Tobin a

22:23.063 --> 22:23.863
physical before he went

22:23.864 --> 22:24.797
to prison.

22:24.798 --> 22:25.564
So, maybe we're

22:25.565 --> 22:26.632
looking at a physician-assisted

22:26.633 --> 22:29.134
suicide?

22:29.201 --> 22:30.435
Let's bring in

22:30.436 --> 22:32.336
Dr. Brandt.

22:33.672 --> 22:35.572
Do you see the woman in the

22:35.573 --> 22:36.440
blue coat?

22:36.441 --> 22:37.709
Yeah.

22:37.710 --> 22:38.942
Good.

22:38.943 --> 22:40.943
Say hello.

22:42.112 --> 22:44.946
Hello.

22:45.014 --> 22:47.114
What's this for?

22:47.182 --> 22:49.182
Box 17.

23:19.241 --> 23:21.242
âª âª

23:32.385 --> 23:34.386
Jesus Christ.

23:40.125 --> 23:42.093
Thank you, Patty.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.595
The girl was delightful.

23:44.663 --> 23:45.829
Just what I needed.

23:45.830 --> 23:48.531
I'm glad.

23:48.599 --> 23:50.600
So...

23:52.235 --> 23:54.303
Say what you will about Reagan,

23:54.370 --> 23:56.971
the '80s were marvelous years

23:57.039 --> 23:58.373
for people like me and

23:58.374 --> 23:59.974
Louis Tobin.

23:59.975 --> 24:02.776
Global prospectors looking for

24:02.844 --> 24:05.746
boundless opportunity and if you

24:05.813 --> 24:07.781
had the money and you knew where

24:07.848 --> 24:11.117
to look, extraordinary things

24:11.184 --> 24:12.451
were happening in the

24:12.452 --> 24:14.019
Caribbean.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.420
Where in the

24:15.421 --> 24:16.755
Caribbean, exactly?

24:16.756 --> 24:18.122
All over.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.257
Especially Antigua.

24:20.325 --> 24:22.659
And if you had a few hundred

24:22.727 --> 24:24.394
million to throw around, you

24:24.395 --> 24:26.796
could really do business.

24:26.864 --> 24:27.964
Provided you were

24:27.965 --> 24:29.331
willing to go around the

24:29.332 --> 24:30.933
international banking laws.

24:30.934 --> 24:32.367
Well, of course,

24:32.368 --> 24:34.268
the feds caught on over time,

24:34.270 --> 24:36.837
but by then, it was too late.

24:36.905 --> 24:38.605
So Tobin could have

24:38.606 --> 24:40.007
buried his accounts?

24:40.008 --> 24:41.475
Before those clouds

24:41.476 --> 24:45.144
rolled in, those islands were a

24:45.212 --> 24:48.214
financial candy land.

24:48.281 --> 24:49.782
You want to find that money?

24:49.783 --> 24:51.316
Don't look further than the

24:51.317 --> 24:54.385
Caribbean.

25:07.298 --> 25:10.299
Hi.

25:26.146 --> 25:27.413
Is that it, or...?

25:27.414 --> 25:28.681
Don't forget to thank Mr.

25:28.682 --> 25:31.884
Zedeck.

25:34.887 --> 25:36.388
Okay.

25:36.389 --> 25:39.390
Thank you.

25:54.303 --> 25:57.304
Yeah, Perry.

25:59.574 --> 26:00.674
Yeah, we have an appointment.

26:00.675 --> 26:03.710
Send him up.

26:06.946 --> 26:08.980
Sort of an architect?

26:09.048 --> 26:10.749
Well, listen, I-I

26:10.750 --> 26:12.116
need to apologize for the first

26:12.117 --> 26:13.251
time we met.

26:13.252 --> 26:14.518
Yeah.

26:14.519 --> 26:16.419
Stupid as it sounds,

26:16.454 --> 26:19.756
uh... I was nervous.

26:19.824 --> 26:21.558
I'm not used to approaching

26:21.559 --> 26:23.926
people.

26:23.994 --> 26:26.095
People tend to seek me out.

26:26.162 --> 26:28.897
Well, Sterling Biddle

26:28.965 --> 26:31.166
recommends you highly.

26:31.233 --> 26:34.235
Come in.

26:40.108 --> 26:42.343
Huh.

26:42.410 --> 26:43.877
These downtown factory

26:43.878 --> 26:45.245
conversions are so rich with

26:45.246 --> 26:46.647
history.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.881
It's always felt like

26:47.882 --> 26:51.384
I'm living in a hotel.

26:51.452 --> 26:52.852
My ex-husband made all the

26:52.853 --> 26:55.855
interior design choices.

26:57.858 --> 26:58.925
I pulled the original

26:58.926 --> 27:00.827
city plans for the building.

27:00.894 --> 27:03.262
When your husband did this

27:03.329 --> 27:04.596
conversion, he was choosing

27:04.597 --> 27:08.899
clean line over original detail,

27:08.967 --> 27:13.003
but your beauty, the history,

27:13.071 --> 27:15.772
the warmth all lie behind these

27:15.840 --> 27:18.841
walls.

27:22.846 --> 27:24.479
It would take a few days demo to

27:24.480 --> 27:25.914
fully see what we have to work

27:25.915 --> 27:27.382
with.

27:27.383 --> 27:29.050
Or I could take a hammer to it

27:29.051 --> 27:30.752
right now and show you.

27:30.753 --> 27:31.986
But you'd, uh... you'd have to

27:31.987 --> 27:33.220
be willing to live with some

27:33.221 --> 27:34.421
mess.

27:34.422 --> 27:36.222
You think you're ready?

27:36.223 --> 27:37.524
Now's not a good time

27:37.525 --> 27:39.892
for that.

27:39.960 --> 27:41.861
No rush.

27:41.928 --> 27:43.595
It's your timetable.

27:43.596 --> 27:45.130
Think about it.

27:45.131 --> 27:48.133
It's a big responsibility.

27:50.136 --> 27:53.137
You know where to find me.

28:16.527 --> 28:20.293
There's a card.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.360
For your mother.

28:21.361 --> 28:22.594
This guy is full of

28:22.595 --> 28:23.996
shit.

28:23.997 --> 28:25.197
Okay, I'm missing

28:25.198 --> 28:27.499
the point he's trying to make.

28:27.567 --> 28:29.267
You said you needed proof he had

28:29.268 --> 28:31.936
access to the money.

28:32.004 --> 28:34.271
And then he sends me
this?

28:34.339 --> 28:35.339
Well, Joe, you said

28:35.340 --> 28:36.606
you'd go to the authorities if

28:36.607 --> 28:37.641
Zedeck didn't come through with

28:37.642 --> 28:38.641
the money.

28:38.642 --> 28:39.642
I know.

28:39.643 --> 28:40.676
He called your

28:40.677 --> 28:42.577
bluff.

28:42.679 --> 28:45.680
What do you want to do now?

28:47.249 --> 28:50.251
Send the coat back.

28:55.657 --> 28:56.690
Thank you for meeting

28:56.691 --> 28:59.158
me without Debbie and the kids.

28:59.226 --> 29:00.326
I hate sneaking around like

29:00.327 --> 29:01.393
this.

29:01.394 --> 29:02.728
No problem.

29:02.729 --> 29:04.429
You've given so

29:04.430 --> 29:05.730
much help already, but I don't

29:05.731 --> 29:07.331
know where else to turn.

29:07.332 --> 29:08.332
What's-What's going

29:08.333 --> 29:11.335
on?

29:14.840 --> 29:16.140
I don't know what I'm

29:16.141 --> 29:17.141
gonna do.

29:17.142 --> 29:19.410
What's going on?

29:19.478 --> 29:20.578
Your mother-in-law-

29:20.579 --> 29:21.713
you know about her cancer

29:21.714 --> 29:22.914
treatments.

29:22.915 --> 29:24.449
Sure.

29:24.450 --> 29:25.683
Well, because of the

29:25.684 --> 29:28.850
Tobins, we've lost important

29:28.918 --> 29:31.086
coverage.

29:31.154 --> 29:34.221
I'm 75 years old.

29:34.289 --> 29:35.722
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

29:35.723 --> 29:36.823
I- I can't even afford health

29:36.824 --> 29:37.490
care.

29:37.491 --> 29:38.724
I- I can't pay my premiums.

29:38.725 --> 29:39.891
Arthur, it's, uh...

29:39.892 --> 29:42.226
Just-Just tell me...

29:42.294 --> 29:45.296
How-How much do you need?

29:52.937 --> 29:55.938
Tom?

29:57.942 --> 30:00.944
Tom?!

30:05.750 --> 30:08.819
Tom?

30:17.196 --> 30:20.732
Tom, you here?

30:24.004 --> 30:27.006
Is that the money?

30:31.312 --> 30:32.847
Does Patty know about this?

30:32.848 --> 30:33.848
Don't worry about

30:33.849 --> 30:35.749
Patty.

30:42.318 --> 30:44.254
Everything Biddle
told you checks out.

30:46.022 --> 30:47.609
There was a limited
window of investment,

30:47.610 --> 30:49.264
and l thee loholes
were closed.

30:49.265 --> 30:51.233
Any accounts like
that in the Tobins' assets?

30:51.301 --> 30:54.836
No, but even if there were, we don't
know how Tobin could have managed it.

30:54.904 --> 30:57.905
These accounts require that
everything be done in person.

30:57.972 --> 30:59.940
No wire transfers, no phone
transactions.

31:00.007 --> 31:02.108
No. Tobin would have
needed someone he trusted to

31:02.175 --> 31:04.809
conduct his business in the
Caribbean, often and discreetly.

31:04.877 --> 31:06.844
Someone who could literally fly
under the radar.

31:06.912 --> 31:09.316
You've searched their
travel records?

31:09.383 --> 31:10.967
Yeah, it wasn't any
of the Tobins, or

31:10.968 --> 31:12.618
Danielle Marchetti,
or Leonard Winstone.

31:12.619 --> 31:15.054
There's no record of
any Tobin associate making the

31:15.122 --> 31:16.756
trip to anywhere in the

31:16.757 --> 31:18.657
Caribbean, let alone Antigua.

31:18.691 --> 31:20.124
One last thing?

31:20.125 --> 31:24.060
These accounts can only be
opened by a citizen of the island.

31:24.128 --> 31:27.597
So, effectively, we have to rule out
everyone we've been investigating.

31:27.665 --> 31:29.565
Afraid so.

31:30.469 --> 31:32.937
Sorry.

31:33.005 --> 31:36.072
Yes, Megan.

31:36.140 --> 31:38.308
Oh, I-I promise I'll be there.

31:38.376 --> 31:40.143
Yeah, I'll see you at the

31:40.144 --> 31:41.144
school.

31:41.145 --> 31:42.144
Okay.

31:42.145 --> 31:43.178
Dr. Brandt, how long

31:43.179 --> 31:44.613
did you know Louis Tobin?

31:44.614 --> 31:45.614
Hmm, since grade

31:45.615 --> 31:46.614
school.

31:46.615 --> 31:48.015
I was his personal physician for

31:48.016 --> 31:49.516
almost 50 years.

31:49.517 --> 31:50.517
This is Louis Tobin's

31:50.518 --> 31:50.584
au

31:50.585 --> 31:52.452
topsy report.

31:52.453 --> 31:53.720
Cause of death is listed as

31:53.721 --> 31:54.721
cardiac arrest.

31:54.722 --> 31:55.722
Oh.

31:55.723 --> 31:56.823
Toxicology report

31:56.824 --> 31:58.090
indicates high levels of

31:58.091 --> 31:59.491
potassium in his system.

31:59.492 --> 32:00.726
Well, that would be

32:00.727 --> 32:02.727
consistent with cardiac arrest.

32:02.795 --> 32:04.029
But it can also mean

32:04.030 --> 32:05.029
a potassium overdose?

32:05.030 --> 32:06.697
Isn't that right?

32:06.698 --> 32:07.765
That is very

32:07.766 --> 32:09.366
difficult to determine.

32:09.367 --> 32:11.401
Potassium levels rise normally

32:11.469 --> 32:12.769
after death.

32:12.770 --> 32:14.670
Now, in Louis's case, I think

32:14.705 --> 32:16.539
heart attack would be the more

32:16.540 --> 32:17.606
likely scenario.

32:17.607 --> 32:19.507
Why is that?

32:19.509 --> 32:21.242
Because he had a

32:21.243 --> 32:22.243
heart problem.

32:22.244 --> 32:23.244
For years.

32:23.245 --> 32:24.779
He was under medication for it.

32:24.780 --> 32:26.380
Hmm. I see.

32:26.381 --> 32:28.448
Do you know Danielle Marchetti?

32:28.516 --> 32:29.983
Uh, I read about her

32:29.984 --> 32:30.984
in the newspapers.

32:30.985 --> 32:32.018
This is her autopsy

32:32.019 --> 32:33.419
report.

32:33.420 --> 32:34.654
She had the same elevated levels

32:34.655 --> 32:37.656
of potassium in her system.

32:39.826 --> 32:40.859
Because I can think

32:40.860 --> 32:41.859
of another explanation for

32:41.860 --> 32:43.894
Louis's death.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.496
And what's that?

32:45.497 --> 32:46.330
He didn't want to

32:46.331 --> 32:47.297
face life in prison so he took

32:47.298 --> 32:49.532
an overdose of potassium.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.000
His personal physician may have

32:51.001 --> 32:53.001
helped him.

32:57.673 --> 32:58.507
You may be able to live with

32:58.508 --> 33:00.308
helping an old friend avoid

33:00.309 --> 33:01.376
jail, but do you really want

33:01.377 --> 33:02.477
Danielle Marchetti on your

33:02.478 --> 33:04.244
conscience as well?

33:04.245 --> 33:05.579
I had nothing to do

33:05.580 --> 33:07.448
with Danielle Marchetti.

33:07.449 --> 33:09.450
But Louis?

33:12.488 --> 33:13.654
He asked me for a way

33:13.655 --> 33:16.190
out.

33:16.258 --> 33:17.191
I explained to him about

33:17.192 --> 33:19.860
potassium, how it'd be painless.

33:19.928 --> 33:21.562
But I did not provide him with

33:21.563 --> 33:23.197
anything.

33:23.198 --> 33:23.998
He must've gotten that on his

33:23.999 --> 33:25.399
own.

33:25.400 --> 33:26.200
And Danielle

33:26.201 --> 33:27.801
Marchetti?

33:27.802 --> 33:28.702
I don't know anything

33:28.703 --> 33:30.203
about that.

33:30.204 --> 33:31.471
In your medical

33:31.472 --> 33:33.406
opinion, is it possible Danielle

33:33.473 --> 33:35.941
died from a similar mixture?

33:36.009 --> 33:38.176
I just don't

33:38.244 --> 33:39.411
understand how that would've

33:39.412 --> 33:43.582
happened.

33:43.649 --> 33:46.651
But, uh, I would have to say

33:46.719 --> 33:51.257
yes, it's entirely possible.

33:53.961 --> 33:54.661
Thanks for seeing

33:54.662 --> 33:55.696
me again.

33:55.697 --> 33:57.598
Sure.

33:57.665 --> 33:59.299
How's it going with Patty?

33:59.300 --> 34:01.200
Well, um, she asked

34:01.202 --> 34:02.569
me to do something for her.

34:02.570 --> 34:04.571
What?

34:18.554 --> 34:20.087
There you go.

34:20.088 --> 34:21.987
Iranian caviar.

34:21.989 --> 34:22.822
Bless you,

34:22.822 --> 34:24.222
sweetheart.

34:24.223 --> 34:28.190
Thank you for smuggling this in.

34:28.259 --> 34:32.532
Wait.

34:32.599 --> 34:36.101
Stay and watch me eat it.

34:36.168 --> 34:37.502
And she made it

34:37.503 --> 34:39.471
seem like a test- like if I did

34:39.538 --> 34:40.572
it, she'd hire me.

34:40.572 --> 34:41.940
Did you do it?

34:41.940 --> 34:42.907
Yeah.

34:42.908 --> 34:43.773
Did she hire you?

34:43.774 --> 34:45.108
No.

34:45.109 --> 34:46.108
And she's acting like I don't

34:46.109 --> 34:47.310
exist.

34:47.311 --> 34:49.212
She won't meet with me, she's

34:49.280 --> 34:51.114
not returning my calls.

34:51.114 --> 34:53.014
What should I do?

34:55.386 --> 35:00.889
Run away.

35:00.957 --> 35:04.591
Seriously, far away.

35:04.659 --> 35:06.126
Forget about the job; forget

35:06.127 --> 35:09.096
about Patty.

35:14.702 --> 35:17.404
Hey, Joe returned the mink.

35:17.472 --> 35:18.305
He didn't give it to

35:18.306 --> 35:19.206
his mother?

35:19.207 --> 35:20.607
No, he threw it back in your

35:20.608 --> 35:21.775
face.

35:21.776 --> 35:23.676
He doesn't trust you.

35:25.947 --> 35:26.780
Then I don't trust

35:26.781 --> 35:28.982
him.

35:34.185 --> 35:35.784
Tommy, I miss

35:35.785 --> 35:38.585
anything?

35:38.653 --> 35:40.086
Just the choir.

35:40.087 --> 35:41.721
Band hasn't started playing yet.

35:41.722 --> 35:42.988
That's good.

35:42.989 --> 35:44.555
Wife would've cut my balls off

35:44.556 --> 35:47.655
if I missed this shit.

35:47.723 --> 35:50.056
I just flew in from

35:50.124 --> 35:51.324
Tucson.

35:51.325 --> 35:52.158
Don't even ask me what I shot

35:52.159 --> 35:54.026
in the back nine.

35:54.027 --> 35:55.327
You were out there

35:55.328 --> 35:56.595
playing golf?

35:56.596 --> 35:57.863
Yeah, just for the

35:57.864 --> 35:58.997
day.

35:58.998 --> 35:59.964
I like to hit the links once or

35:59.965 --> 36:01.666
twice a month.

36:01.667 --> 36:04.869
Thank God for a private plane.

36:04.937 --> 36:07.104
You took the jet?

36:07.172 --> 36:07.905
Well, how else you

36:07.906 --> 36:08.805
gonna be where you need to be

36:08.806 --> 36:10.474
when you need to be there?

36:10.475 --> 36:11.207
You should come with sometime,

36:11.208 --> 36:11.942
Tom.

36:11.943 --> 36:13.843
Do you some good to get away.

36:14.544 --> 36:17.447
Oh, shit.

36:17.514 --> 36:18.748
Turn off your ringer.

36:18.749 --> 36:19.582
Save my seat, would

36:19.583 --> 36:22.449
you?

36:22.517 --> 36:24.818
No cell phones.

36:33.059 --> 36:33.892
Say no more, I'll

36:33.893 --> 36:36.761
swing by on Thursday.

36:36.829 --> 36:38.029
Yeah, no problem.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.697
All right, we'll set it up.

36:39.698 --> 36:40.798
Hey, what's going on?

36:40.799 --> 36:42.534
Meeting Debbie here?

36:42.535 --> 36:43.701
Don't.

36:43.702 --> 36:44.636
What?

36:44.637 --> 36:45.336
Act like nothing

36:45.337 --> 36:47.605
happened.

36:47.673 --> 36:49.073
Tommy, you told me

36:49.074 --> 36:50.074
to be aggressive.

36:50.075 --> 36:51.075
I lost everything; my

36:51.076 --> 36:52.176
family lost everything.

36:52.177 --> 36:53.377
You put us in Leverett; you

36:53.378 --> 36:54.846
said you had a personal "in."

36:54.847 --> 36:55.747
Yeah, so?

36:55.748 --> 36:56.514
Did you know that

36:56.515 --> 36:57.181
Leverett was invested with

36:57.182 --> 36:57.882
Tobin?

36:57.883 --> 36:58.616
I didn't.

36:58.617 --> 36:59.450
You didn't want to

36:59.451 --> 37:00.184
know.

37:00.185 --> 37:00.918
You just wanted returns.

37:00.919 --> 37:01.752
I trusted you!

37:01.753 --> 37:02.753
Look, you gambled,

37:02.754 --> 37:03.588
you lost.

37:03.589 --> 37:04.956
Now stop crying about it.

37:04.957 --> 37:05.690
All right, just unload some

37:05.691 --> 37:07.425
assets and start all over again.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.393
Regroup, regrow, you could be

37:09.461 --> 37:10.761
back on your feet in no time.

37:10.762 --> 37:11.596
Don't give me that

37:11.597 --> 37:12.463
shit!

37:12.464 --> 37:13.564
Hey.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.465
You became a lawyer because you

37:15.533 --> 37:17.000
care about the rules?

37:17.001 --> 37:18.367
Who are you kidding?

37:18.368 --> 37:19.435
You're a rich little bitch and

37:19.436 --> 37:20.268
you had too much fun at the

37:20.269 --> 37:21.036
party and now you've got a

37:21.037 --> 37:21.736
hangover.

37:21.737 --> 37:23.637
Grow up, it happens.

37:36.116 --> 37:36.849
Hello?

37:36.850 --> 37:37.683
Hey, it's Alex

37:37.684 --> 37:38.450
Benjamin, you'll never believe

37:38.451 --> 37:39.351
this.

37:39.352 --> 37:40.285
Patty just called and she hired

37:40.286 --> 37:42.120
me.

37:42.121 --> 37:43.521
Oh, really?

37:43.522 --> 37:45.389
Congratulations, that's, that's

37:45.390 --> 37:46.657
amazing.

37:46.658 --> 37:47.390
Anyway, thanks for

37:47.391 --> 37:48.557
your help.

37:48.558 --> 37:50.557
You're welcome.

37:50.625 --> 37:52.856
Good luck, Alex.

38:15.069 --> 38:16.069
You're staying in a

38:16.070 --> 38:18.437
hotel?

38:18.505 --> 38:21.941
That's no way to live, Joe.

38:22.008 --> 38:23.675
What the hell do you

38:23.676 --> 38:25.010
want?

38:25.011 --> 38:28.112
The fur.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.347
I tried to do a little something

38:29.348 --> 38:30.381
nice for your mother, but you

38:30.382 --> 38:31.648
didn't give it to her.

38:31.649 --> 38:32.416
I don't give a shit

38:32.417 --> 38:33.149
about the mink.

38:33.150 --> 38:33.917
That's not the proof I need,

38:33.918 --> 38:35.185
okay?

38:35.186 --> 38:35.952
You got some fresh

38:35.953 --> 38:37.787
mouth on you.

38:37.788 --> 38:38.655
And it's not a mink, it's a

38:38.656 --> 38:41.124
sable.

38:41.192 --> 38:42.193
When I give you a fur coat, you

38:42.194 --> 38:44.128
take it.

38:44.196 --> 38:44.996
Now I don't know if I can trust

38:44.997 --> 38:46.897
you, Joe.

38:46.965 --> 38:49.933
And I can trust you?

38:50.001 --> 38:50.934
Your father always

38:50.935 --> 38:55.805
said you were ungrateful.

38:55.873 --> 38:57.140
The fur had nothing to do with

38:57.141 --> 38:59.076
you or me.

38:59.143 --> 39:01.647
It was for your mother.

39:05.118 --> 39:07.352
Listen, just...

39:10.990 --> 39:12.057
Look in the bottom dresser

39:12.058 --> 39:14.626
drawer.

39:46.361 --> 39:47.896
Patty, I'm at

39:47.897 --> 39:49.429
Farmingdale Airport.

39:49.430 --> 39:50.362
Why? What's up?

39:50.363 --> 39:51.896
I had a talk with a

39:51.897 --> 39:53.528
guy who owns a private jet and

39:53.529 --> 39:55.259
that gave me an idea.

39:55.260 --> 39:56.426
About what?

39:56.427 --> 39:57.125
I think I know who

39:57.126 --> 39:58.224
the Tobins used to move money

39:58.225 --> 39:59.523
into the Caribbean.

39:59.524 --> 40:00.557
Yeah?

40:00.558 --> 40:03.659
Danielle Marchetti's
daughter.

40:03.727 --> 40:05.060
Turns oushe's a flight

40:05.061 --> 40:07.129
attendant for a private airline.

40:07.196 --> 40:07.996
Now deplaning,

40:07.997 --> 40:11.232
Flight #7 from Antigua.

40:22.244 --> 40:25.079
Here's Shayes' car.

40:28.583 --> 40:29.617
If Shayes was wounded in the

40:29.618 --> 40:32.586
accident, he probably bled.

40:32.653 --> 40:33.753
You see any blood?

40:33.754 --> 40:36.088
No, but I don't
think this is just an accident.

40:36.156 --> 40:38.656
Until we learn different, let's

40:38.724 --> 40:41.158
consider it a crime scene.

40:42.426 --> 40:45.027
They forgot to bag the keys.

40:45.095 --> 40:46.429
What are you doing?

40:46.430 --> 40:50.431
Before the techs get here,
I want to check something.

41:06.776 --> 41:09.043
Oh, boy.

41:12.881 --> 41:16.416
I like where this
case is heading.

41:17.418 --> 41:18.918
How was the concert?

41:18.919 --> 41:20.187
I missed it.

41:20.188 --> 41:21.655
Jesus, what happened?

41:21.656 --> 41:22.556
I made up my mind.

41:22.557 --> 41:23.224
About what?

41:23.225 --> 41:24.992
I'm not selling
anything.

41:24.993 --> 41:25.859
Tom? Tom.

41:25.860 --> 41:27.828
I'm gonna get our
money back.

41:27.896 --> 41:29.796
Tom? Tom?
