to A&E's Biography, "Twinkee the Kid."

It was difficult for Twink
to play with other children.

He was different.

10:20.954 --> 10:25.918
He was definitely... He had no bones.
And he couldn't really play any sports.

He loved that lasso.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.181
Not as much as the baton.

10:39.264 --> 10:42.893
But we put a stop to the baton.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.646
He was different enough.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.982
If we find that Twinkee factory,
we'll have all the food we need.

Maybe someday we'll return.

12:22.242 --> 12:25.704
For what? A Twinkee factory
that might not even exist anymore?

She's right.
Besides, this place is paradise.

12:51.980 --> 12:55.067
It's nice to have music while we eat.

12:55.442 --> 12:59.905
"Red-headed lady, reaching for an apple

13:00.197 --> 13:03.992
"Gonna take a bite, nope, nope

"She's gonna breathe on it first

LOIS: Let's get the hell out of here.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.821
"Yeah, they're walking down the road

13:40.904 --> 13:45.909
"Left foot, right foot,
left foot, right foot, left..."

13:47.578 --> 13:50.080
CHRIS: [Singing]
"Left foot, right foot, left foot"

13:50.163 --> 13:53.750
Please, Chris.
Mommy's got a big headache. Stop it!

13:54.543 --> 13:58.172
Thank you, sweetie.
Now, Peter, we've gotta find some food.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.673
Oh, my God! Look!

14:01.341 --> 14:02.926
It's Natick.

14:03.051 --> 14:05.179
[Cheering]

14:07.389 --> 14:09.141
There's no factory?

14:09.349 --> 14:12.019
Very good, fat man!

14:12.144 --> 14:14.021
We follow the Pied Piper of Hamsteak...

14:14.104 --> 14:16.982
...to the gates of oblivion,
and look what it's brought us!

14:17.191 --> 14:21.111
We're finished! We're done!
Game over, man! Game over!

14:21.820 --> 14:24.364
STEWIE: Damn it!
LOIS: Get out of that nuclear waste!

14:24.448 --> 14:26.575
Who knows what animals
have been in there?

14:26.783 --> 14:29.077
[Suspenseful instrumental music]

14:33.081 --> 14:34.625
[Cheering]

14:36.126 --> 14:37.753
STEWIE: It's about damn time!

14:40.756 --> 14:45.427
No words... Should have sent a poet.

14:45.511 --> 14:47.221
There's enough food to last us forever!

14:47.304 --> 14:49.640
Peter, we're saved! You were right.

14:49.723 --> 14:53.185
We can settle down here and build
a house, just like we had in Quahog.

14:53.268 --> 14:55.729
We can build a mall,
so I'll have a place to hang out!

14:55.812 --> 14:57.940
And two Denny's, so we can always say:

14:58.023 --> 15:00.150
"Let's not go there.
Let's go to the good one."

15:00.234 --> 15:02.653
We can have Quagland
get Joe out of the driveway.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.239
And we can build a community,
just like the one we had.

15:05.322 --> 15:07.533
No! We'll build a better one.

15:07.616 --> 15:10.994
I hereby proclaim this city New Quahog!

15:11.662 --> 15:13.455
[Energy pulsating]

15:13.872 --> 15:16.291
This isn't very good, now, is it?

[Cheerful instrumental music]

15:34.059 --> 15:35.269
[Quagmire screaming]

15:43.151 --> 15:45.529
-Guess who?
-Stop it, Chris.

15:45.612 --> 15:49.741
Wrong! Wait. Did you say "Chris"?

15:49.992 --> 15:52.077
Stewie, time for breakfast!

15:53.495 --> 15:56.832
Did you wash your tentacles,
my big handsome boy?

15:56.915 --> 15:58.125
What the devil are you talking about?

15:58.208 --> 16:02.171
Handsome? I'm repugnant!
I'm a radio-bloody-active freak!

16:08.677 --> 16:12.931
I fold. Come on, let's go home
and get tender with your wife.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.516
I don't know, Quagmire.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.437
Lovemaking with Loretta
has somehow lost its intimacy.

16:20.856 --> 16:22.107
All right!

16:23.275 --> 16:24.610
BRIAN: Excuse me, Mr. Mayor.

16:24.693 --> 16:26.862
An outsider
who wishes to join our community.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.947
Welcome to my fair city!

16:29.156 --> 16:31.825
If you want to become a citizen,
you have to get a job.

16:31.909 --> 16:34.077
Before the disaster, I was a physician.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.538
That's terrific. We need a doctor.

16:36.622 --> 16:40.209
We sure do. Let's hope you get it.
Now pick a job out of the hat.

16:41.627 --> 16:43.587
"Village idiot." That's a good one.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.173
On Tuesdays,
you get to wave your penis at traffic.

16:46.256 --> 16:47.424
Congratulations.

16:48.467 --> 16:50.886
JOE: Maybe we should've
just let him be a doctor.

16:50.969 --> 16:53.722
No! These are the rules of New Quahog.

16:54.097 --> 16:56.308
Besides,
that's how everyone else got their jobs.

16:56.767 --> 16:57.768
Go!

16:57.851 --> 16:59.478
[Frantic screaming]

16:59.978 --> 17:02.523
You see, Doc, my back tooth is killing me.

17:02.648 --> 17:03.649
[Screaming]

17:04.024 --> 17:06.068
And things have worked out fine so far.

17:06.151 --> 17:09.696
Peter, no offense,
but that's because we all pitched in.

17:09.821 --> 17:12.032
That's right.
We built schools, and hospitals.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.784
Yeah, not to mention the theater.

17:18.330 --> 17:22.292
"But when I saw the movie,
it looked like Audrey Hepburn not only...

17:22.376 --> 17:27.548
"...didn't have breakfast at Tiffany's,
she hadn't eaten anything in a year.

[Hooting]

17:29.132 --> 17:30.551
"I am such a bitch!"

17:30.634 --> 17:34.304
We have everything we need.
And no crime, no guns, no pollution.

17:34.388 --> 17:35.514
Brian's right.

17:35.597 --> 17:39.685
We've left ourselves defenseless.
Guys, we need to make some guns.

17:39.810 --> 17:43.021
Guns? Guns only lead to trouble.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.815
When that trouble happens,

17:44.898 --> 17:46.608
we'll be ready
to blow its freakin' head off!

17:46.775 --> 17:48.235
Besides, without guns...

17:48.318 --> 17:50.779
...how would our forefathers
settle their differences?

17:50.988 --> 17:54.908
8, 9,10, and turn!

18:00.247 --> 18:03.876
Honey, Mommy's making you
some new feetie pajamas.

18:04.168 --> 18:08.172
And look, it has a little trap door
for when you gotta make inky.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.048
I'll show you inky!

18:10.132 --> 18:12.676
-Let's see if they fit.
-Never!

18:13.552 --> 18:14.553
[Mocking laughter]

18:14.678 --> 18:17.014
Look at me! I'm Fred Astaire!

18:18.307 --> 18:21.018
Gotcha. You are getting heavy.

18:21.310 --> 18:22.978
I'll have your dad flood the basement...

18:23.061 --> 18:25.022
...so you can get some more exercise.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.774
Yes. I do seem to have gained
a bit of girth.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.861
Actually, my gullet seems to be rumbling.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.196
[Grunting]

18:32.279 --> 18:33.363
There we are.

18:34.072 --> 18:37.492
I say. I've laid an egg!
That wasn't so bad.

18:37.576 --> 18:40.495
I don't know what these women
are always complaining about...

18:41.163 --> 18:46.168
PETER: Attention, New Quahogians.
Today my vision for our future comes true.

18:46.710 --> 18:49.922
A chicken in every pot,
and a cap in every ass!

18:50.631 --> 18:54.176
Peter, put that away! Where did you get
the metal for all those guns?

18:54.259 --> 18:57.221
Recycling. I used the pipes
from our irrigation system.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.640
WOMAN: Are you crazy?
You destroyed our water pipes?

18:59.723 --> 19:01.892
MAN: We don't need guns!
We need food and water!

19:01.975 --> 19:03.352
I have a canker sore on my lip!

19:03.435 --> 19:07.064
And I keep poking at it with my tongue!
But that's only making it worse!

19:07.147 --> 19:09.525
PETER: There's a reason
I'm in charge here, okay?

19:09.608 --> 19:11.151
I knew the world was gonna end.

19:11.235 --> 19:14.363
I'm the one who found the Twinkee factory
and started this town.

19:14.446 --> 19:16.907
I'm the one who gave
elocution lessons to Rosie Perez.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.700
That's nothing to be proud of!

19:25.374 --> 19:27.501
LOIS: Wait! We can work this out!

19:31.630 --> 19:33.423
I haven't been thrown out of any place...

19:33.507 --> 19:35.926
...since I was a counselor
at the bulimia clinic.

19:36.009 --> 19:39.263
Man, did anybody else throw up
after eating that fish last night?

would we ever need guns for?

you asked me...

Honey, I'm sorry I got us
kicked out of New Quahog.

20:25.517 --> 20:27.561
I guess nobody really needs guns.

20:28.312 --> 20:29.813
I'm not always right, after all.

20:29.897 --> 20:31.064
Oh, Peter.

20:31.148 --> 20:34.484
Hearing you say that almost makes it
worth having the world blown up.

20:34.568 --> 20:35.652
Where are we gonna go?

20:35.736 --> 20:38.405
I hear there's a Carvel factory
in Framingham.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.574
All right! Fudgie the Whale!

20:40.657 --> 20:45.078

And Nutty the Chocolate Ghost!

21:19.112 --> 21:21.448
Oh, Bobby. I just had the weirdest dream.

21:21.532 --> 21:24.117
I dreamt I saw the strangest episode
of Family Guy.

21:24.201 --> 21:27.246
And there was a giant chicken!
And Stewie was an octopus.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.706
Hey, hey. Come on now.

21:30.332 --> 21:32.709
It's all right.
