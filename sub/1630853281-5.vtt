15:06.840 --> 15:09.520
Thanks, Merv.
Thanks for coming in.

It's nice to see you
looking so smart too.

Tomorrow's another day.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.600

15:23.600 --> 15:25.640
You were the one who quit.

15:30.720 --> 15:32.920
TROTTER: And you are gonna love it.
And we have spare rooms...

15:32.920 --> 15:34.680
Hey, what can I get you?

15:34.680 --> 15:36.520
What? It's a good thing.
TRACY: You don't cook dinner.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.160
I always cook the dinner, Trace.

15:38.160 --> 15:39.960
Dani, Trot's gone and bought Dumbo.

15:39.960 --> 15:41.920
Don't call it that.
Well, why's it called Dumbo?

15:41.920 --> 15:44.280
It's not.
It's a white elephant.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.200
Actually, Dumbo was grey.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.560
This rich wanker
built it on top of a cliff,

15:48.560 --> 15:50.800
then his wife divorced him
before he finished it...

15:50.800 --> 15:52.320
Didn't he pork her sister?

15:52.320 --> 15:53.840
It's all very romantic.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.640
Right? And...I got it for a steal.

15:56.640 --> 15:57.840

Dani agreed
to be interviewed for my thesis -

16:32.520 --> 16:35.280
being a woman
in a male-dominated world.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.800
Surfing, obviously.

16:37.800 --> 16:38.800
Ah.
Oh.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.920
I was on my way to
a Womyn's Camp nearby, so...

16:41.920 --> 16:44.160
..I thought I'd stop in.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.520
What's your PhD?

16:46.520 --> 16:49.640
Feminist separatism
and institutional misogyny.

16:52.080 --> 16:56.320
Well, can I buy you a drink, Tash,
or am I being a...sexist pig?

16:56.320 --> 16:58.320
Vodka. Straight.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.000

No, I'll get it.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.760
No, no, we're good. Thanks, Dad.

17:30.760 --> 17:32.440
Yeah, righto.
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

17:32.440 --> 17:33.560
Love you!

17:34.560 --> 17:36.760
You look really happy in this.

17:36.760 --> 17:39.280

all night.

18:00.640 --> 18:04.080
Yeah, you really
caught me off guard.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.440
Are you ashamed of me?

18:08.440 --> 18:10.040
Well...

18:10.040 --> 18:11.120
..yeah.

18:13.360 --> 18:15.280
What were you thinking?
I hardly know you.

18:15.280 --> 18:17.480
You can't just follow me here
and turn my life upside down.

18:17.480 --> 18:20.360
Firstly, I didn't follow you, OK?
I took a small detour.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.760
And second...
Shh. Just...

18:22.760 --> 18:24.600
No offence,
it's not like your friends

18:24.600 --> 18:25.840
are going to put us two together.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.480

27:20.800 --> 27:22.520
Haircuts, ladies.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.160
Ah! Mrs Dwyer!

27:24.160 --> 27:25.160
Mr Lockwood.

27:25.160 --> 27:27.360
I wanted to ask
how young Peter's adjusting.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.560
Uh...
He's a bit shaken up by everything,

27:30.560 --> 27:33.920
but I'm sure he'll come back to class
as soon as he's ready.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.160
Right.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.760
See, I'm running a school here,
Mrs Dwyer,

27:37.760 --> 27:39.400
not a halfway house.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.360
Now, if Peter doesn't attend
tomorrow,

27:41.360 --> 27:44.560
I'll have to take the matter
to the Department, alright?

27:55.840 --> 27:57.520
REGGIE: Dimma!

27:57.520 --> 27:59.280
Hey, Reg.

27:59.280 --> 28:01.000
So, how's life on the outside?

28:02.000 --> 28:03.760
Living the dream.

28:04.840 --> 28:06.520
Haven't seen you at Windys.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.280
I don't really feel like surfing.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.680
That's a shame. It'd help.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.120
I have to mop the kitchen.

28:17.480 --> 28:19.920
Maybe I'll see you
on the dawn patrol.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.920
Be good
to see you on the water again.

28:21.920 --> 28:23.000
Hey, Reg?

28:24.000 --> 28:26.800
I appreciate what you did for me
in juvie.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.160
Good advice.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.800
You really shouldn't
give up surfing, Dimma.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.840
I mean, what else are you good at?

28:39.840 --> 28:41.560
Shouldn't you still be in school?

28:41.560 --> 28:44.800
Dropped out, didn't I?
Got better things to do.

28:44.800 --> 28:45.960
Yeah, right.

28:45.960 --> 28:49.120
You not surfing doesn't hurt anyone
but yourself, you know?

28:52.680 --> 28:54.240
Hey, Miss!

28:54.240 --> 28:56.960
If you're not coming back to school,
you might as well call me Tracy.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.640
OK, Miss.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.720
I don't wanna hear it.

29:02.720 --> 29:04.760
The headmaster bailed me up
about you.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.840
You have to come back to school.

29:06.840 --> 29:07.840
Dimma!

29:07.840 --> 29:10.960
DE LUCA: That's it, Joey!
Where you wanna throw it.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.360
Hi, Joe.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.720
Ah, Kelly! Welcome!

29:14.720 --> 29:16.520
Hi. (CHUCKLES)
(CHUCKLES)

29:16.520 --> 29:18.960
My wife, Sofia.

29:18.960 --> 29:20.240
Nice to meet you.
Hi.

29:20.240 --> 29:21.720
And Joe Junior over there.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.280
Sweetheart,
this is the next big thing.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.160
Kelly Fox.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.080
Joe De Luca.
Oh, Buddy.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.560
Buddy, we've heard of you.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.840
My son wants to learn how to surf.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.520
Oh, you should come visit.
We'll take you out.

29:34.520 --> 29:36.000
Kelly!
Hi, Warren.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.400
Warren you know, of course.

29:38.400 --> 29:40.000
This must be the boyfriend.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.360
Oh, uh...Warren, this is...

29:41.360 --> 29:43.480
Buddy Fraser. I know you!

29:43.480 --> 29:45.600
Huge fan.

29:45.600 --> 29:50.000
Yeah, I saw you at the Hawaiian
Invitational. You were unstoppable.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.840
Well, I can't believe you saw that.

29:52.840 --> 29:54.280
Yeah, we were shooting
a picture out there.

29:54.280 --> 29:57.000
Yeah, Aloha Charlie.
You... You were really great in that.

29:57.000 --> 29:58.480
Thanks, man!
Yeah!

29:59.480 --> 30:01.200
Well, you've got a nice place here,
Joe.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.560
We like it.
What's your poison, Buddy?

30:03.560 --> 30:05.040
Uh... Got a mojito?

30:05.040 --> 30:07.480
Let me make it for ya.

30:10.280 --> 30:13.280
This is supposed
to be MY chemistry test.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.920
You've got five minutes.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.760
Uncle Hayden!

30:27.760 --> 30:29.160
Cee Cee.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.480
Hello.

30:30.480 --> 30:31.600
Mwah.

30:31.600 --> 30:34.640
This is my friend that
I was telling you about - Bernie.

30:34.640 --> 30:36.520
Bernard and Marilyn Hunter's son.

30:36.520 --> 30:37.760
Ah!

30:37.760 --> 30:39.720
Pleased to meet you, sir.
Sit down, son.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.600
Thank you, sir.

30:46.280 --> 30:49.120
Cee Cee tells me you have
a little business proposition?

30:49.120 --> 30:50.480
Yes, sir.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.840
A very exciting opportunity,
I believe,

30:53.840 --> 30:59.160
for Carroways to get in on the ground
floor of a next-wave industry.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.600
Lightwave board shorts...

31:09.600 --> 31:14.480
..are the future of beach, surf
and summer water wear.

31:14.480 --> 31:19.480
The fabric, the design, the patterns
is like nothing we've seen before,

31:19.480 --> 31:25.480
with huge market appeal for men
in that nice 18-to-40 demographic.

31:25.480 --> 31:28.160
True story, Mr Carroway -

31:28.160 --> 31:32.400
my business partner and I
were surfing Bali -

31:32.400 --> 31:34.600
we're talking actual paradise -

31:34.600 --> 31:37.040
and we had a lightbulb moment -

31:37.040 --> 31:41.800
board shorts that don't
weigh you down in the water.

31:41.800 --> 31:45.160
This is my business partner
rockin' them.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.000
Buddy Fraser.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.440
He's a three-time US surf champ.

31:50.560 --> 31:54.720
I have stores across the Midwest,
kid. No surf out there.

31:55.720 --> 31:57.680
That's right.

32:01.040 --> 32:04.960
And maybe wearing these shorts
to take the kids to the local pool

32:04.960 --> 32:08.880
is as close to the dream
as they're going to get.

32:11.240 --> 32:14.920
But every man deserves
to at least dream of paradise.

32:24.560 --> 32:27.760
What's your unit cost,
margin and mark-up?

32:44.960 --> 32:47.000
You spin a good yarn, kid.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.760
Might all be a bunch of hooey,

32:49.760 --> 32:53.280
but if Cee Cee speaks for you,
then it's good enough for me.

32:54.480 --> 32:57.000
I'll take 10,000 units
by the end of the month.

32:57.000 --> 32:59.160
Can you handle that?

32:59.160 --> 33:01.240
(LAUGHS)

33:01.240 --> 33:03.600
Yes, sir.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.520
(LAUGHS) I can't believe
that just happened!

33:06.520 --> 33:09.160
You were really good back there.
Thank you!

33:10.280 --> 33:12.360
We have to celebrate.

33:12.360 --> 33:14.120
You and me.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.720
I can't. I have a date.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.360
A date?
Mm-hm.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.280
Is it serious?

33:24.640 --> 33:26.160
Richard seems to think so.

33:27.160 --> 33:28.320
Richard.

33:28.320 --> 33:29.800
Richard Walton.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.960
Everyone calls him Dick.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.760
Mm. I bet they do.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.440
DE LUCA: Her name's Kelly Fox.

33:38.440 --> 33:41.600
I'm telling, you, Bob, Warren
wants her in the picture. (SNIFFS)

33:41.600 --> 33:45.560
I mean, she's beautiful and he fucks
everything that moves, so...

33:45.560 --> 33:47.040
Yeah, I am. Hang on.

33:47.040 --> 33:48.800
(SNORTS)

33:48.800 --> 33:50.880
Ah! (SNIFFS) Ah!

33:50.880 --> 33:53.880
And, uh...we'll do a camera test
for you, Bob. Don't worry.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.280
Hey, Warren.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.520
Hell of a party, huh?

34:06.520 --> 34:08.120
Hey, Bud.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.960
What's going on?

34:11.880 --> 34:12.880
(CHUCKLES)

34:12.880 --> 34:15.120
Sorry to have to rush off, Joe.
Not at all.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.040
See you at the camera test,
sweetheart.

34:17.040 --> 34:21.240
The studio want to see
sparks between you and Warren, hm?

34:21.240 --> 34:23.000
It's just a formality.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.280
OK.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.320
Thank you so much, Joe.

34:28.960 --> 34:30.360
(ENGINE STARTS)

34:37.080 --> 34:38.960
Listen to me.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.240
There's nothing going on
with Warren.

34:41.240 --> 34:43.640
I caught him peeing near the pool.
That's it.

34:43.640 --> 34:45.480
But you're gonna
have to get used to this.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.120
Can't you see the way
he looks at you?

34:47.120 --> 34:48.240
He's acting.

34:48.240 --> 34:50.000
He's an actor.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.680
Joe basically just said
I have the part.

34:52.680 --> 34:55.280
The camera test is a formality.

34:55.280 --> 34:57.080
Buddy, this is my big break.

34:57.080 --> 34:59.280
Can't you just be happy for me?

35:03.720 --> 35:06.760
I've never actually
been jealous before.

35:08.760 --> 35:11.400
That's 'cause you weren't with me.

35:29.200 --> 35:32.200
(SWING MUSIC PLAYS)

35:37.560 --> 35:40.280
What are we celebrating?
I got the part.

35:40.280 --> 35:42.360
I'm gonna be in a movie
with Warren Dean.

35:42.360 --> 35:45.240
(SNIFFS)
She passed her chemistry test.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.760
Right on!

35:47.760 --> 35:50.360
I see you've got your own
chemistry test going on there, Bud.

35:50.360 --> 35:52.640
J Edgar Hoover over here
is getting rid of my stash.

35:52.640 --> 35:54.120
I'm going clean for the movie.

35:54.120 --> 35:56.080
Ah! Happy to help.

35:56.080 --> 35:58.280
Well, I had a win today too.

35:58.280 --> 36:01.200
Found a way to pay Trotter
his licence fee.

36:01.200 --> 36:03.480
Hey!
Hunter!

36:03.480 --> 36:04.480
Yeah!

36:04.480 --> 36:06.600
Well done, honey.
Thank you.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.040
Yeah, you too!

36:08.040 --> 36:10.040
Well, you should come here.

36:10.040 --> 36:11.240
Come here.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.880
I wanna introduce you to my friend

36:13.880 --> 36:16.080
George Washington.

36:16.080 --> 36:17.840
No.
No, no, no, you should meet him.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.240
No.
Come on, he's nice!

36:19.240 --> 36:20.280
No. OK.

36:20.280 --> 36:21.800
Take a load off.

36:23.240 --> 36:24.720
(CLAPS) Yeah!

36:25.720 --> 36:28.000
Whoo! (LAUGHS)

36:28.000 --> 36:30.680
Whoo-hoo!

36:30.680 --> 36:32.760
(LAUGHS)
Agh!

36:32.760 --> 36:34.960
(LAUGHS)

36:37.920 --> 36:39.440
STUDENT: Did you have to
go to school in there?

36:39.440 --> 36:41.240
Yeah, what was it like in there?
Were there any fights?

36:41.240 --> 36:44.560
Yeah, what happened? Tell us all
about it. What happened in there?

36:45.560 --> 36:47.400
Hello, Miss.

36:48.480 --> 36:49.800
It's good to have you back.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.720
Sure is.

36:51.720 --> 36:53.360
I'm not coming back.

36:54.960 --> 36:57.960
Just wanted
to tell my favourite teacher that.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.640
You're kidding, right?

37:02.640 --> 37:04.640
Nope.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.360
Don't you walk away from me.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.760
STUDENTS: Ooh!

37:12.760 --> 37:15.120
Settle down. I mean it.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.440
Dimma!

37:17.440 --> 37:19.280
Peter! Stop!

37:19.280 --> 37:21.760
You're not leaving school!

37:21.760 --> 37:23.560
Watch me.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.560
I know everything
feels like a mess right now,

37:25.560 --> 37:26.720
but it will get better soon.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.920
I'm old enough,
I can make my own mind up.

37:28.920 --> 37:30.920
(SCOFFS) To do what?

37:30.920 --> 37:33.120
I don't know.
(SIGHS)

37:33.120 --> 37:35.680
This is stupid. Get back to class.

37:37.280 --> 37:39.040
You're not my teacher anymore.

37:40.040 --> 37:41.640
You think this
is what Mum would have wanted?

37:41.640 --> 37:43.920
How would I know?
You remember her.

37:43.920 --> 37:45.480
Don't you?
Not really, no.

37:45.480 --> 37:47.840
All I get is bossed around by you
and ignored by Dad.

37:47.840 --> 37:49.160
I don't need it anymore.

37:49.160 --> 37:51.480
Dimma, don't walk away.

37:51.480 --> 37:53.680
You're stronger than this.
How do you know?!

37:53.680 --> 37:56.480
You have to give yourself
another chance.

37:56.480 --> 37:59.000
You're just a kid.

38:00.240 --> 38:02.200
It's too late, Trace.

38:03.200 --> 38:04.720
I'm done.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.560
DE LUCA: Here she is!

38:19.560 --> 38:21.000
Hello!

38:21.000 --> 38:23.320
Wow. (LAUGHS)
(KISSES)

38:23.320 --> 38:24.720
Hello.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.600
Look at us. Gangster and his moll.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.680
Hey, Bud!

38:33.600 --> 38:36.960
Might be best
if he waits outside, right?

38:36.960 --> 38:39.800
I want to take a look
at the love scene too.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.400
Sounds good.
Yeah, alright. Let's do it.

38:42.400 --> 38:43.400
Let's do it.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.440
They just think
it'll be less distracting.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.080
Oh, and you think that too, do you?

38:47.080 --> 38:50.080
Look, they don't want you in there,
alright? It's a closed set.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.360
Why? Why?
So you can actually fuck him?

38:52.360 --> 38:54.080
The bed?

38:54.080 --> 38:56.840
It's a set, Buddy.
It's called acting!

38:56.840 --> 38:59.520
This is not about acting, baby, OK?

38:59.520 --> 39:03.760
He's a movie star. He... He's got
wannabes like you queueing up!

39:06.240 --> 39:09.040
Is that what you think I am?

39:09.040 --> 39:11.160
A fucking wannabe?

39:12.680 --> 39:16.120
You really think they got
the Levi's girl in for her acting.

39:19.600 --> 39:21.120
Asshole.

39:32.800 --> 39:34.800
(CRIES)

39:39.400 --> 39:41.160
Baby?

39:44.400 --> 39:45.840
I, uh...

39:46.840 --> 39:51.240

53:06.880 --> 53:08.600
You said we could pay 10% up-front

53:08.600 --> 53:10.560
and the balance in the 60 days,
yeah?

53:10.560 --> 53:12.560
Yeah, not for these numbers.

53:12.560 --> 53:15.520
If you want an order this big,
you're gonna have to pay in full.

53:15.520 --> 53:16.680
Wh..

53:17.680 --> 53:19.800
Where am I supposed
to pull that kind of money from?

53:19.800 --> 53:21.040
Not my problem.

53:21.040 --> 53:23.480
OK, look, listen,
we're good for it, trust me.

53:23.480 --> 53:26.000
We've got a nationwide retail deal
with Carroways Department Store...

53:26.000 --> 53:30.280
Exactly why you need to pay
100% up-front.

53:30.280 --> 53:32.720
OK, Gina...

53:32.720 --> 53:34.640
..you got our logos wrong.

53:34.640 --> 53:38.800
Yeah. Look, if you can find
a cheaper place, go there.

53:38.800 --> 53:41.040
I don't get paid till the back end.
You know that.

53:41.040 --> 53:42.880
Not my problem.

53:56.360 --> 53:58.760
After a party like that, it almost
feels like Dumbo could be our house.

53:58.760 --> 54:00.160
Well, good,

54:00.160 --> 54:02.160
'cause I signed Glen's contract.

54:05.720 --> 54:08.840
Anything else you wanna tell me?

54:08.840 --> 54:12.920
When the US money comes in,
we're expanding the business.

54:12.920 --> 54:15.200
Into what?

54:16.200 --> 54:17.920
Wetsuits.

54:18.920 --> 54:21.920

SONG: # Poor old Grandad

54:33.000 --> 54:36.360
# I laughed at all his words

54:36.360 --> 54:39.640
# I thought he was a bitter man

54:39.640 --> 54:42.720
# He spoke of women's ways

54:42.720 --> 54:45.960
# They'll trap you
Then they use you

54:45.960 --> 54:49.000
# Before you even know

54:49.000 --> 54:52.360
# For love is blind
and you're far too kind

54:52.360 --> 54:55.520
# Don't ever let it show

54:55.520 --> 55:00.240
# I wish that I knew what I know now

55:00.240 --> 55:01.920
# When I was younger

55:01.920 --> 55:06.600
# I wish that I knew what I know now

55:06.600 --> 55:08.280
# When I was stronger... #

55:26.800 --> 55:30.160
DANI: So you're really moving here?
Once you see it, you'll want to too.

55:30.160 --> 55:31.880
Try making wetsuits without rubber.

55:31.880 --> 55:33.680
You bastard. You locked me out.

55:33.680 --> 55:35.440
I don't know
what you're talking about, mate.

55:35.440 --> 55:38.600
The rubber has gone to Bare Feet for
years, and I'm honouring my contract.

55:38.600 --> 55:40.200
Hey, do you wanna
get dinner with me tonight?

55:40.200 --> 55:41.280
Yeah, why not?

55:41.280 --> 55:44.120
You. Shirley. Bali.

55:44.120 --> 55:45.120
Yes!

55:45.120 --> 55:46.920
Hey!
