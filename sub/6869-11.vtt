WEBVTT

00:01.551 --> 00:04.963
No, coordinate with Rome,
then get me the lastest intel,

00:05.083 --> 00:08.488
then tell Rodney they need
travel docuents an hour ago.

00:08.901 --> 00:11.436
Then bring me the file I asked for!

00:11.556 --> 00:14.312
***

00:14.352 --> 00:15.508
- What was that?
- Nothing.

00:15.628 --> 00:19.807
Good. Saved you the embarrassment
of an incredible homophobic remark.

00:22.633 --> 00:23.968
- Ow!
- Sorry!

00:24.192 --> 00:25.063
What's going on?

00:25.183 --> 00:27.626
- Where?
- Uh, this new place called here?

00:28.132 --> 00:28.986
Nothing.

00:30.654 --> 00:31.666
Malory!

00:32.338 --> 00:35.158
Good luck! She just had an electro--

00:37.402 --> 00:40.762
Electro-magnetic lock installed!

00:40.882 --> 00:42.786
Are you serious?

00:42.906 --> 00:45.073
- Malory!
- Because I'm seriously

00:45.074 --> 00:47.427
asking, did Krieger
give you robot hands?

00:47.547 --> 00:49.772
Not yet! But
you just say the word.

00:49.892 --> 00:52.125
The -

00:52.454 --> 00:54.255
Out.

00:54.256 --> 00:57.992
Can't have anything nice...
Krieger!

00:57.993 --> 00:59.860
Jazz hands!

00:59.861 --> 01:03.064
Should've never
taken him to see "The Wiz."

01:03.065 --> 01:05.966
The Broadway
show or the movie?

01:05.967 --> 01:08.436
Jazz hands!

01:08.437 --> 01:09.937
Both.

01:09.938 --> 01:12.173
Jazz hands!

01:12.174 --> 01:16.310
I -- whatever, look, obviously there's-
Nothing! Is going on,

01:16.311 --> 01:19.015
Lana! If there were, I would tell you, but-

01:19.092 --> 01:21.326
Uh, there's a
Cardinal Corelli on line one

01:21.327 --> 01:23.028
for you? Something about a
radical faction of the Swiss

01:23.029 --> 01:26.256
Guard assassinating the
pope tomorrow night?

01:27.566 --> 01:31.103
You need to get that?

02:09.071 --> 02:11.373
No, I'm sure whoever it is-

02:11.374 --> 02:14.142
It's the Vatican!
Line one! Jesus!

02:14.143 --> 02:16.978
Shit, I
hope he didn't hear that.

02:16.979 --> 02:18.179
Or that, shit!

02:18.180 --> 02:20.148
Just put him
through, you idiot!

02:20.149 --> 02:20.848
Okay,

02:20.849 --> 02:23.952
- Jesus!  Shit...
- Uhhhhh.

02:23.953 --> 02:27.322
Ah ha ha, Giancarlo! Como stai?

02:27.323 --> 02:32.593
Molto meglio, cara mia, now
that I see your eyes, your lips, your...

02:32.594 --> 02:35.563
Giancarlo!
Siete senza vergogna.

02:35.564 --> 02:38.466
And you, are the only
woman who ever made me regret

02:38.467 --> 02:40.402
taking the holy orders.

02:40.403 --> 02:43.193
And you are the only man
who ever made me-

02:43.313 --> 02:44.854
Come oonnn!

02:44.974 --> 02:46.241
I'm right here, ya know!

02:46.242 --> 02:46.908
Why?!

02:46.909 --> 02:50.111
Gettin new carpet in my office.
Which, speaking of...

02:50.112 --> 02:50.979
Ron?!

02:50.980 --> 02:52.981
Malory,
you have married?

02:52.982 --> 02:54.282
Ehh...

02:54.283 --> 02:56.418
You are a
fortunate man, signore.

02:56.419 --> 02:58.386
Ah, blow
it out yer cassock.

02:58.387 --> 02:59.120
Ron!

02:59.121 --> 03:02.991
Malory. We don't have much time.
Your agents of ISIS, they are ready?

03:02.992 --> 03:05.860
Or they are confused
verging on angry?

03:05.861 --> 03:10.265
Lana, it's an undercover mission.
At the Vatican?

03:10.266 --> 03:13.901
What, they don't have black nuns?
Although granted

03:13.902 --> 03:18.239
I've never seen one. But that's
not like, a rule, is it?

03:18.240 --> 03:20.048
- Ehh...
- Well since you're

03:20.074 --> 03:21.676
not sending me, and
I assume you're

03:21.677 --> 03:23.124
not sending Ray...

03:23.244 --> 03:25.361
To the Vatican?
You think all those Catholic

03:25.481 --> 03:30.251
priests wouldn't peg him-
as American?

03:30.252 --> 03:31.786
With that hillbilly accent?

03:31.787 --> 03:34.655
Malory, I must go now.
Please hurry!

03:34.656 --> 03:39.394
So not Ray, and not me, which leaves...

03:40.463 --> 03:47.969
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti, et cetera, et -

03:47.970 --> 03:49.170
You can't.

03:49.171 --> 03:51.306
No one is gonna believe
Archer is a priest.

03:51.307 --> 03:53.574
For your infor-
I'm in! Turn it off!

03:53.575 --> 03:54.476
Okay!

03:54.477 --> 03:56.277
Jesus!  Shit.

03:56.278 --> 03:59.481
For your information, Lana, I
have totally prepared for this mission.

03:59.482 --> 04:01.149
Well there's a firs-
First thing I did was

04:01.150 --> 04:04.052
watch every episode of "Lucy,
Daughter of the Devil." Which

04:04.053 --> 04:06.787
by the way, was grossly-
Inadequate preparation,

04:06.788 --> 04:10.425
for an undercover mission protecting the
pope from an assassination attempt!

04:10.426 --> 04:12.560
I was gonna say
"underrated," but -

04:12.561 --> 04:15.730
But even if you were prepared-
Which I truly feel that I am.

04:15.731 --> 04:19.500
-- but which you're not, who's
your backup if Ray's not going? Cyril?

04:19.502 --> 04:21.555
- No...
- No, it turns out Cyril-

04:21.676 --> 04:22.619
Aaagh!

04:22.739 --> 04:24.239
How bout a little warning?!

04:24.359 --> 04:27.175
Has a thing.
About church stuff.

04:27.176 --> 04:28.076
Since when?

04:28.077 --> 04:30.745
Since none of your beeswax, and-
Bwoohahaahaaa!

04:30.746 --> 04:31.546
Aaagh!

04:31.547 --> 04:33.023
Well...

04:33.143 --> 04:38.034
And I think I
need a spanking, because I have been a very

04:38.154 --> 04:41.313
naughty baaaaagh!

04:43.283 --> 04:46.561
Guess that explains that.
But it doesn't explain

04:46.562 --> 04:48.663
how Archer's gonna run
this mission by himself.

04:48.664 --> 04:51.866
Well, if you were
"confused verging on angry"

04:51.867 --> 04:53.535
- before...
- Aaagh!

04:53.536 --> 04:54.436
What?!

04:54.437 --> 04:57.838
Jesus Christ...
Shit. God damn it.

04:57.839 --> 04:58.639
Pam!

04:58.640 --> 04:59.340
What.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.007
Pam?!

05:00.008 --> 05:00.841
What?!

05:00.842 --> 05:01.543
Paaaam!

05:01.544 --> 05:03.945
Whaaat?!

05:03.946 --> 05:06.814
I dunno,
what're we doing?

05:06.815 --> 05:09.150
Esatto! Che
cosa stiamo facendo?!

05:09.151 --> 05:11.286
Aww man, we
have to learn Latin?

05:11.287 --> 05:13.154
Ew yeah,
that's a dealbreaker.

05:13.155 --> 05:14.322
You were speaking Latin

05:14.323 --> 05:15.590
when you walked in here -

05:15.591 --> 05:16.724
Mmmmno...

05:16.725 --> 05:19.394
-- whereas I was just
speaking Italian, which neither

05:19.395 --> 05:20.595
of you speak nor even

05:20.596 --> 05:22.564
understand, obviously, so -

05:22.565 --> 05:23.565
So?! Lana, the

05:23.566 --> 05:26.568
assassination plot is being
hatched by the Swiss Guard?

05:26.569 --> 05:27.902
So...?

05:27.903 --> 05:29.971
So it's an eight-hour
flight, so we get some tapes

05:29.972 --> 05:32.307
and brush up on our-
Swiss?

05:32.308 --> 05:32.873
Duh?

05:32.874 --> 05:35.477
Well, since Swiss isn't
a language, maybe you should

05:35.478 --> 05:38.913
get some tapes on German,
French, Italian and Romansh.

05:38.914 --> 05:40.148
Maybe I will.

05:40.149 --> 05:43.451
Alright. Lana pack a bag, you're-
No! Mother come on, we

05:43.452 --> 05:45.330
don't need-
Lana! Is going!

05:45.450 --> 05:46.198
Ha!

05:46.318 --> 05:49.090
And Pam, if you keep
your eyes open and your big

05:49.091 --> 05:51.491
mouth shut, you just might
learn something from her.

05:51.534 --> 05:52.300
Ha!

05:52.301 --> 05:53.769
Why are you going ha?!

05:53.770 --> 05:55.104
I dunno, what're we doing?

05:55.105 --> 05:57.973
I'll tell you what we
should be doing. So, who does

05:57.974 --> 05:59.608
the pope remind you of?

05:59.728 --> 06:01.110
Ha!

06:01.111 --> 06:02.011
What.

06:02.012 --> 06:02.945
Haaa!

06:02.946 --> 06:06.115
Shut up! And
you also shut up.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.116
Yessir.

06:07.117 --> 06:07.950
Haaa!

06:07.951 --> 06:09.691
Why are you
still going ha?!

06:09.811 --> 06:12.121
Pink Panther's on.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.723
Father Guido Sardoochbag?

06:19.522 --> 06:21.056
Oh really?

06:21.057 --> 06:23.625
Because she didn't
specify an agent in-command,

06:23.626 --> 06:25.617
Lana, so I would argue-
With a fence post.

06:25.737 --> 06:28.724
I wouldn't argue with a -- oof!
Move, idiot!

06:28.806 --> 06:30.240
I'm goin as fast as I can!

06:30.241 --> 06:32.309
Not you, the-
The fence post?

06:32.310 --> 06:33.043
Ha!

06:33.044 --> 06:36.379
It was a bollard! And my point was-
Fine! You're agent-in-

06:36.380 --> 06:39.382
command! Now shut up, brief
Corelli, and get the access

06:39.383 --> 06:40.416
code to the pope's apartment!

06:41.252 --> 06:44.754
I... will,
because I command me to.

06:44.755 --> 06:48.892
And you should eat, this could be
a long night, and you're... so teeny.

06:48.893 --> 06:49.659
Hm?

06:49.660 --> 06:52.829
Seriously, eat,
you're like a slow loris.

06:52.830 --> 06:55.332
Oh, no, bit
off my feed, I'm afraid.

06:55.333 --> 06:58.969
Woodhouse, you need to-
Oh c'mon, you need to fix?

06:59.803 --> 07:01.671
Well, is there some
amount you can shoot up to get

07:01.672 --> 07:05.708
right for the mission, without
gettin all... trainspotty?

07:05.709 --> 07:06.609
Back in a tick!

07:06.610 --> 07:11.047
Oh for the -- and thanks for making
me carry your bag through customs!

07:11.048 --> 07:12.983
No, thank you!

07:12.984 --> 07:13.984
Grazie.

07:13.985 --> 07:17.120
Grazie mille, vostra...
majesty-o?

07:17.121 --> 07:20.357
Your Italian
is, how you say, shit?

07:20.358 --> 07:22.492
Then you are not
gonna like my Romansh.

07:22.493 --> 07:24.928
Mio dio! You
think this is funny?!

07:24.929 --> 07:26.296
I thought that was.

07:26.297 --> 07:28.431
Assassins plan to kill
the Holy Father in his own

07:28.432 --> 07:33.370
bed, on this very night, ma tu
stai qui con la testa nel culo!

07:33.371 --> 07:37.540
Whoa whoa, take it down a notch, St.
Louis! His head is not up his ass!

07:37.541 --> 07:39.142
How'd you
know what he said?

07:39.143 --> 07:40.377
It was an
eight-hour flight.

07:40.378 --> 07:42.145
Wow, did
you learn Romansh?

07:42.146 --> 07:44.881
Who am I, Cypher?
The gayest X-man?

07:44.882 --> 07:48.451
I dunno, Gambit looks like
he knows his way around a pair of -

07:48.452 --> 07:50.420
Basta! Here is the
access card to the Holy

07:50.421 --> 07:55.392
Father's private apartment. I
assume you have a plan once inside?

07:55.393 --> 07:58.395
We call it the
old switcheroo.

07:58.396 --> 08:00.063
We absolutely do not
call it the old switcheroo.

08:00.064 --> 08:02.332
Mio dio!

08:03.334 --> 08:06.036
I know, right?
Trope alert!

08:06.037 --> 08:07.170
Che?

08:07.171 --> 08:11.741
Eh... non si traduce bene.

08:11.742 --> 08:12.809
Feeling better?

08:12.810 --> 08:15.412
Sound as
a pound, my dear.

08:15.413 --> 08:17.213
Where the hell are we?

08:17.214 --> 08:20.417
Uh, this new
place called Italy?

08:20.418 --> 08:22.385
How'd I get
all the way downtown?

08:22.386 --> 08:23.853
Wh-? Not Little Italy!

08:23.854 --> 08:25.221
Italy, Italy!

08:25.222 --> 08:27.557
Bloody hell.
What are we doing here?

08:27.558 --> 08:32.429
Thwarting an assassination attempt
on the pope. Using you as a decoy.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.431
Back in a tick!

08:34.432 --> 08:36.666
With Ken and your weekend weather.
And you may need an

08:36.667 --> 08:38.900
umbrella because it's
going to be raining.

08:38.902 --> 08:40.570
Dead ass popes.

08:40.571 --> 08:43.239
Aw crap,
he's already dead.

08:43.240 --> 08:45.875
No he's not, he's just old.
That's how Woodhouse looks

08:45.876 --> 08:46.977
when he's asleep.

08:46.978 --> 08:48.211
I'm gonna get a mirror.

08:48.212 --> 08:50.680
Right until he wakes
and sees me staring at him

08:50.681 --> 08:54.684
with night-vision goggles and
literally pisses himself. Hey,

08:54.685 --> 08:57.687
does Woodhouse seem unhappy to you,
or -- what the hell're you doing?!

08:57.688 --> 09:00.590
Gonna see if his
breath fogs it up.

09:00.591 --> 09:05.061
Put the stupid mirror back, he's not-

09:05.062 --> 09:07.464
Dead. Nice
job, Oliver Cromwell.

09:07.465 --> 09:08.398
I killed the pope!

09:08.399 --> 09:11.634
Yeah, that's why I said Oliver Crom-
Jesus Christ I'm going to

09:11.635 --> 09:15.905
hell I'm going to hell I'm going to hell I'm-

09:15.906 --> 09:16.572
Pam.

09:16.573 --> 09:18.475
Yes?

09:18.476 --> 09:21.478
Get off the pope.

09:21.479 --> 09:25.715
- Heeey, Your Holiness...
- Is he dead?!

09:25.716 --> 09:27.617
I dunno, shut up, I'm-
Should I get another

09:27.618 --> 09:30.586
mirror? But like, a
much much smaller one?

09:30.587 --> 09:32.755
No, you're
half heroin already!

09:33.491 --> 09:37.494
Okay, here's Junkie Brewster, let's...
Where's the pope?

09:37.495 --> 09:38.594
Soo, Here's the thing.

09:38.595 --> 09:39.929
Promise you won't get mad?

09:39.930 --> 09:43.433
I -- actually do not promise I won't
get mad, because here's what thing?

09:43.434 --> 09:44.426
Um...

09:44.546 --> 09:47.451
What, why is there
a giant mirror on the oh my God

09:47.571 --> 09:48.838
you crushed the pope?!

09:48.839 --> 09:52.442
Don't just stand there idiots,
help me get it off and Pam! Woodhouse!

09:52.443 --> 09:53.510
Huh? Oh!

09:53.511 --> 09:54.511
Oof!

09:54.512 --> 09:55.512
Ow!

09:55.513 --> 09:58.281
Ow! What the --
is that a needle?!

09:59.150 --> 10:00.417
Rrrrrgh!

10:01.185 --> 10:01.784
Oh thank God!

10:01.785 --> 10:04.521
Chi siete voi,
dove sono le guardie?!

10:04.522 --> 10:06.989
We're -- Your Holiness,
do you speak English?

10:06.990 --> 10:09.926
Yes, of course, but-
Ha! Way to waste your

10:09.927 --> 10:11.928
time learning Italian, Pam!

10:11.929 --> 10:15.932
Aw, stai zitto, testa di cazzo.
And could you...?

10:15.933 --> 10:17.200
Sorry.

10:17.201 --> 10:19.802
Dio mio! He
look just like me!

10:19.803 --> 10:22.072
Yes, Your Holiness, he's a decoy.
We have reason to

10:22.073 --> 10:24.607
believe a faction of the Swiss
Guard will make an attempt on

10:24.608 --> 10:26.909
your life tonight, so-
So if you don't mind

10:26.910 --> 10:31.013
- hopping out of those pope-jamas...
- Archer? We'll hide you,

10:31.014 --> 10:33.216
put him in your place,
wait for them to come in -

10:33.217 --> 10:35.452
And then what?!
You are only two!

10:35.453 --> 10:38.154
Well three, so-
Better make that two.

10:38.155 --> 10:40.990
Think I mighta grabbed the
tail of the dragon here...

10:40.991 --> 10:43.226
Ooh, then
you're in for a treat!

10:43.227 --> 10:45.962
Shut up! And with all
due respect Your Holiness,

10:45.963 --> 10:50.032
it's the Swiss Guard... I think
we can handle a few court jesters

10:50.033 --> 10:51.568
with, whatever, halberds.

10:51.569 --> 10:54.571
Which, you realize
are just ceremonial.

10:54.572 --> 10:58.741
Obviously they're ceremonial,
they were made obsolete by the arquebus.

10:58.742 --> 11:01.578
Which is why
now they use MP-5's.

11:01.579 --> 11:02.579
Oh.

11:02.580 --> 11:06.015
Which is why where's the gear bag
with all of our automatic weapons?!

11:06.016 --> 11:08.751
Well I assume in the hotel room, but-
God -

11:08.752 --> 11:10.220
I thought they
just had halberds!

11:10.221 --> 11:12.188
Do you at least
have a sidearm?!

11:12.189 --> 11:13.823
It was ruining
the lines of my cassock.

11:13.824 --> 11:14.690
Dammit!

11:14.691 --> 11:18.060
And again, I honestly
thought they just had-

11:18.061 --> 11:22.064
-- halberds. Although technically
I think they're called voulges.

11:22.065 --> 11:23.600
Santo Padre!
La porta, per favore!

11:23.601 --> 11:26.369
I got him,
just toss him down!

11:26.370 --> 11:28.738
I'm not tossing
the frickin pope!

11:28.739 --> 11:30.607
Somehow this
is all your fault.

11:30.608 --> 11:31.608
Che?

11:31.609 --> 11:34.177
Oh for the--
this is the pope!

11:34.178 --> 11:36.045
Oh, then WOODHOUSE

11:36.046 --> 11:36.679
Oof!

11:36.680 --> 11:39.382
Ow! Oh for
shit's sake, already!

11:40.451 --> 11:42.619
Archer shut up and find us some-

11:42.620 --> 11:43.319
Sparale!

11:45.589 --> 11:48.191
Oof! Transport!
Are you shitting me?!

11:48.192 --> 11:50.760
Well it was this or the Vespas!
It's not my fault

11:50.761 --> 11:54.631
Italy's so gay. Which, by the
way, Pope, on the gay thing...

11:54.632 --> 11:57.933
La Sacra Bibbia says it
is a mortal sin. But get me out

11:57.934 --> 12:01.037
of here alive and I will
pardon you for it, my son.

12:01.038 --> 12:04.274
Wh-? No, I -
Haaaa!

12:07.312 --> 12:10.547
So why are
you scared of church stuff?

12:10.548 --> 12:12.250
Did the unspeakable happen?

12:12.251 --> 12:15.686
To your slender, hairless,
adolescent body?

12:15.687 --> 12:17.188
Wh-? No!

12:17.189 --> 12:18.689
- Aww...
- Eww!

12:18.690 --> 12:19.456
Right?!

12:19.457 --> 12:23.560
First of all, I'm not- I'm not
scared of priests or nuns or -

12:23.561 --> 12:24.328
Bishops?

12:24.329 --> 12:26.497
No, I just --
Bishop the android from Aliens?

12:26.498 --> 12:29.767
No! I told Ms. Archer
that because I didn't wanna go

12:29.768 --> 12:31.769
on another mission with the
world's worst colleague.

12:31.770 --> 12:33.604
Bishop the
android from Aliens?

12:33.605 --> 12:40.111
Archer! You think he's a dick here?
On a mission he's ten times worse.

12:40.112 --> 12:41.012
That's impossible.

12:41.013 --> 12:42.180
ARCHER  Oh really?!

12:42.181 --> 12:44.348
Yes, really! A, I was a

12:44.349 --> 12:46.851
race car driver! And B-
Archer.

12:46.852 --> 12:48.219
Your Holiness,
a little help?!

12:48.220 --> 12:49.821
The pope could
drive better than you!

12:49.822 --> 12:51.956
No no, io non guido.

12:51.957 --> 12:53.224
Ugh, esatto?

12:53.225 --> 12:55.259
- Oh, capito...
- Why're you taking her

12:55.260 --> 12:56.961
side?! She's Lutheran!

12:56.962 --> 12:59.563
Eh, Luther had
some valid complaints.

12:59.564 --> 13:00.564
Archer! Owwwww!

13:00.565 --> 13:02.733
Drive the
ffffffffrickin car!

13:02.734 --> 13:05.970
Okay, Lana!
What is your problem?

13:05.971 --> 13:08.372
Well there's you...
and also that.

13:08.373 --> 13:10.407
Why aren't
they on horseback?!

13:10.408 --> 13:12.576
Because why
would they be?!

13:12.577 --> 13:16.314
Right, halberdsmen
are foot-soldiers.

13:16.315 --> 13:21.052
Mi scusi, the bigger question is,
if they really are the Swiss Guards...

13:21.053 --> 13:24.688
Why are they wearing Swiss Guard
uniforms, driving a Swiss Guard car?!

13:24.689 --> 13:25.823
Esatto.

13:25.824 --> 13:29.727
Holy sh -- it's a false flag operation!
To make it look

13:29.728 --> 13:31.162
like the Swiss Guard!

13:31.163 --> 13:34.265
Who told you I was
to be assassinated?

13:34.266 --> 13:36.834
Cardinal Corelli! He-
He wouldn't, by any

13:36.835 --> 13:41.572
chance, be next in line
for the papacy, would he?

13:41.573 --> 13:44.041
Well, there would
be an election -

13:44.042 --> 13:45.743
Right, with
the smudge-pot...

13:45.744 --> 13:48.045
-- but Corelli
would be sure to win.

13:48.046 --> 13:49.313
Pretty good motive.

13:49.314 --> 13:52.350
Yeah, you must make a shitlo-

13:52.351 --> 13:54.852
Ahhhhhhhh!!!

13:59.358 --> 14:00.992
Go! What're you doing?!

14:00.993 --> 14:02.360
I'm letting
them catch up!

14:02.361 --> 14:03.160
Why?!

14:03.161 --> 14:06.597
Can I finish?! He
asked, agent-incommandingly!

14:06.598 --> 14:09.800
Take the wheel and maintain speed!
Woodhouse, lighter!

14:09.801 --> 14:12.136
I'm only
ninety pounds wet, sir!

14:12.137 --> 14:15.373
What? No you
idiot, your spoon-cooker!

14:15.374 --> 14:16.374
Oh right.

14:16.375 --> 14:20.978
Like pulling teeth with you people.
Lana! Head toward Swiss Guard HQ!

14:20.979 --> 14:22.846
What, while you
request Freebird?!

14:22.847 --> 14:24.815
Ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha.

14:24.816 --> 14:25.383
Ahh.

14:26.952 --> 14:31.488
Actually that was pretty good, for
you at least, but no, while I do...

14:31.489 --> 14:33.824
Shit, I had a pun about flares.

14:33.825 --> 14:35.326
Fake dynamite?!

14:35.327 --> 14:38.896
That's your plan?! So hey,
can I squeeze in a confession?

14:38.897 --> 14:42.900
Oho, ora
dov'è il tuo Martin Luther?

14:42.901 --> 14:47.704
- Fine, I'll buy a damn indulgence! Oh wait...
- Wait until they're

14:47.705 --> 14:49.807
right beside us,
then swerve into em!

14:49.808 --> 14:53.844
What, so you're crushed between the-
Woohoohoohoooooooooo!

14:53.845 --> 14:56.480
Shoulda seen
that comin...

14:56.481 --> 14:57.673
Hey, I can see St. Peter's from-

14:57.793 --> 14:59.683
Archer look ooouuut!

14:59.684 --> 15:01.986
Goddammit, quit telling
me what to do! I'm the

15:01.987 --> 15:03.887
goddamn agent-in-command!

15:03.888 --> 15:08.426
- Figo, he really drops the G.D. bombs...
- Plus he's a whoremonger.

15:08.427 --> 15:09.427
Cough.

15:09.428 --> 15:14.531
Oh please, who hasn't paid for it?!
Still talking about indulgences.

15:14.532 --> 15:15.532
Lana now!

15:15.533 --> 15:17.969
He said, last wordsingly.
Hang on!

15:17.970 --> 15:19.503
Ahhhh, oh!!

15:19.504 --> 15:20.438
Sparale!

15:20.439 --> 15:21.405
Sparale!

15:22.207 --> 15:24.075
What the-?!
Pam, what'd he say?!

15:24.076 --> 15:26.944
What do you think he said, dicknuts?!
Pay attention

15:26.945 --> 15:28.745
to the frickin context!

15:28.746 --> 15:31.715
Well sorry I don't have
your language-nerd skills!

15:31.716 --> 15:34.418
Hang on... Pambit!

15:34.419 --> 15:35.886
Wrong
X-Man, dumbass!

15:35.887 --> 15:37.855
Still though...

15:37.856 --> 15:39.623
Non lui! Il papa!

15:39.624 --> 15:41.192
Spar'al papa!

15:41.193 --> 15:44.128
- Ohhhh...
- Ohhh, shit! Pam!!

15:44.129 --> 15:44.928
Get doowwwn!

15:44.929 --> 15:45.629
Ungh! Ungh!

15:47.065 --> 15:48.399
Unghh!

15:48.400 --> 15:49.733
Lanaaaa!

15:49.734 --> 15:51.935
Rrrgh. I'm fine!

15:51.936 --> 15:54.438
Yeah me too, asshole!

15:54.439 --> 15:55.473
Oh good.

15:55.474 --> 15:56.474
Is the pope hit?!

15:56.475 --> 16:00.277
Uhh... no, he's,
they're both good.

16:00.278 --> 16:02.846
Recarica!
Spara di nuovo!

16:02.847 --> 16:06.050
Really wish I hadn't focused
so heavily on the Romansh...

16:06.051 --> 16:07.751
ARCHER

16:07.752 --> 16:11.489
Lesson one.
Leshau untg.

16:11.490 --> 16:14.425
Context! They're reloading!

16:14.426 --> 16:17.594
Ohhh... That's
what you mean by context?

16:17.595 --> 16:18.496
Spara!

16:18.497 --> 16:20.331
What else could
she possibly mean?!

16:20.332 --> 16:26.237
Who am I, William Safire?!
Oh and speaking of... in the hole!

16:26.938 --> 16:27.905
What?

16:27.906 --> 16:32.843
Safire in the hole, Lana, it's a-

16:32.844 --> 16:33.511
Waaaagh!

16:33.512 --> 16:36.180
Lana look oooooouuuu-

16:37.815 --> 16:42.619
Ow.

16:42.620 --> 16:46.957
So. The good news is, my men
have apprehended Cardinal Corelli, who

16:46.958 --> 16:48.592
immediately confessed
to the plot.

16:48.593 --> 16:50.994
Hey heyyy,
that is good news!

16:50.995 --> 16:54.631
You know how the whole "the
good news is" thing works, right?

16:54.632 --> 16:56.333
The bad news is-
Oh right.

16:56.334 --> 16:59.002
-- the men you
killed were Camorra.

16:59.003 --> 17:00.438
What're they,
like the mafia?

17:00.439 --> 17:04.608
The Camorra
is like your mafia like...

17:04.608 --> 17:06.544
Seal Team Six is
like the Girl Scouts.

17:06.545 --> 17:08.212
Exactly.

17:08.213 --> 17:10.381
So... equally sexy?

17:10.382 --> 17:10.747
Eww!

17:10.748 --> 17:11.549
Oww!

17:11.550 --> 17:12.683
Oww!

17:12.684 --> 17:18.155
But the real good news, ow! Dick!
Is that we saved the pope's life.

17:18.156 --> 17:22.126
For which we are grateful.
However... We cannot tell

17:22.127 --> 17:26.564
- these two apart, so...
- So I actually have an idea about that.

17:26.565 --> 17:28.665
Is it take them both
home, see which one's a better

17:28.666 --> 17:31.569
butler, and give the other one
back to the Catholic Church?

17:31.570 --> 17:32.636
Never mind.

17:32.637 --> 17:34.805
Then why don't we leave
them both here until they come

17:34.806 --> 17:38.075
to. I'm sure Woodhouse
never gets a vacation.

17:38.076 --> 17:41.378
Are you kidding? I didn't even
let him go to his brother's funeral.

17:41.379 --> 17:42.045
What?!

17:42.046 --> 17:44.582
Oh my -- you asshole!

17:44.583 --> 17:45.449
Was he crushed?!

17:45.450 --> 17:46.584
Probably woulda been.

17:46.585 --> 17:48.185
If I'd told him about it.

17:48.186 --> 17:53.124
Ugh. But wait, why did Corelli
hire ISIS to prevent the assassination?

17:53.125 --> 17:55.659
To show the
cardinals he was trying to

17:55.660 --> 18:00.498
prevent it, all the while assuming-
What, that we'd totally

18:00.499 --> 18:03.033
bl-ow my God he assumed
we'd totally blow it?!

18:03.034 --> 18:06.937
Well... ISIS
has a certain reputation.

18:06.938 --> 18:09.607
Hey, whoa! Not
cool, Payne Stewart!

18:09.608 --> 18:10.941
Oh, my God,
if Malory ever

18:10.942 --> 18:11.975
hears about this -

18:11.976 --> 18:12.783
Which she won't!

18:12.900 --> 18:14.167
Because Pam?!

18:14.168 --> 18:15.101
What?

18:15.102 --> 18:16.336
Promise you'll
never tell Mother!

18:16.337 --> 18:19.341
Okay, I promise!
Swear to God!

18:21.842 --> 18:23.009
What?!

18:23.010 --> 18:24.177
Pam! Pam!

18:24.178 --> 18:27.347
Haaaaa!?
