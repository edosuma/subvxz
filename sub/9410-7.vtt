00:46.733 --> 00:49.933
[ Man ]
Goosebumps.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.933
Viewer beware.

00:53.933 --> 00:56.367
You're in for a scare.

[ Chuckles ]

[ Man ]
Leah, wait up now. [ Grunts ]

01:13.667 --> 01:18.100
I got it. I got it.
Keep going there. Ho! Ho!

01:18.100 --> 01:21.100
- Yeah, that's good.
- [ Chuckles ]

01:21.100 --> 01:24.700
[ Man, Indistinct ]
Easy now. Easy.

01:27.700 --> 01:30.700
It's starting to rain, Leah.
I'm getting real muddy.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.700
Maybe we should
go home now, huh?

01:32.700 --> 01:35.233
- No. I'm having too much fun.
- Okay, okay.

01:42.433 --> 01:44.267
Leah, don't go there.

01:44.267 --> 01:47.867
Grandpa will get your ball for you.

01:47.867 --> 01:49.867
Can you?

[ Roaring ]

02:39.900 --> 02:41.900
But it was too late.

02:41.900 --> 02:44.900
Neither of them
were ever seen again.

02:44.900 --> 02:48.900
They were two more victims of
the mud monster of Muddy Creek.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.033
- That was an excellent report.
- Mmm, thank you.

03:00.467 --> 03:02.467
But you do understand
it was only a legend, right?

03:02.467 --> 03:06.333
Yes. My grandfather told me
the story when I was really little.

03:06.333 --> 03:07.833
See, in my research,

03:07.833 --> 03:10.833
I found that every town
has scary stories and legends.

03:10.833 --> 03:13.333
- "In my research"?
- Little Miss Perfect.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.900
Eddie, do you have something
you'd like to say to the class?

03:16.900 --> 03:20.100
- Uh, no.
- Then please be quiet.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.033
Why do you think people
come up with stories like that?

03:23.033 --> 03:24.833
People have a need
to create monsters.

03:24.833 --> 03:27.333
It helps us believe that
the real world isn't as scary

03:27.333 --> 03:28.933
as the monsters we dream up.

03:29.433 --> 03:30.567
She talks like a book.

03:30.567 --> 03:33.500
But of course, monsters
only exist in our imagination.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.167
[ Girl ]
That's not necessarily true.

03:35.167 --> 03:37.667
There are scientists that
believe Big Foot really exists

03:37.667 --> 03:40.033
and the Loch Ness monster too.

03:40.033 --> 03:42.033
[ Teacher ] But do you have
proof that monsters exist?

03:42.033 --> 03:45.967
Yeah, you're looking at one.
Its name's Courtney.

03:45.967 --> 03:47.933
Proof?
Of course not, Ms. Prince.

03:47.933 --> 03:52.633
See, if I had proof, we wouldn't
be having this little discussion.

03:52.633 --> 03:56.333
- You got a point there, Courtney.
- [ Courtney ] I know.

03:56.333 --> 04:00.367
- A snake!
- Don't be such a chicken. It's for her.

04:00.367 --> 04:04.867
- Ah, a snake for a snake.
- Exactly.

04:04.867 --> 04:07.700
- That's very thorough, Courtney.
- I know. Thank you.

04:07.700 --> 04:11.033
[ Eddie ]
That's so excellent.

04:11.033 --> 04:14.167
You're right about that, Eddie. That
was an excellent report, Courtney.

04:14.167 --> 04:15.667
And we're looking
forward to hearing yours,

04:15.667 --> 04:18.399
if you can ever get it out
of your computer.

04:18.399 --> 04:21.233
But it really is stuck in there.

04:21.233 --> 04:25.033
If you wanna download it to a disk,
I'm sure I can help you print it.

04:25.033 --> 04:27.400
Maybe Courtney
can help you, Eddie.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.400
I can't wait until lunchtime.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.000
[ Both Hissing ]

04:32.000 --> 04:35.400
[ Chattering ]

04:37.900 --> 04:40.900
- This is gonna be good.
- Shh. She'll know something's up.

04:40.900 --> 04:44.533
- Mr. Finley, how are you?
- Very well. Thank you for asking.

04:44.967 --> 04:49.467
- And your family?
- How nice of you to ask. They're fine.

04:49.467 --> 04:51.100
What a kiss-up!

04:51.100 --> 04:55.100
- Well, you have a nice day, Courtney.
- You too, Mr. Finley.

04:55.100 --> 04:58.000
- You're not eating?
- No, I left my lunch at home today.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.633
All right already.
Get to lunch.

05:00.633 --> 05:04.600
- Then please, have a little of mine.
- Oh, no. No, I couldn't.

05:04.600 --> 05:08.733
Please, I insist. My mom,
she always packs too much anyway.

05:08.733 --> 05:11.433
Well, thank you
very much, Courtney.

05:11.433 --> 05:14.233
- She's giving it to Finley.
- Great. We'll get both of them.

05:14.233 --> 05:18.433
And maybe if we're lucky, Mr. Finley
will think Courtney did it on purpose.

05:18.433 --> 05:20.767
[ Mouths Words ]

05:20.767 --> 05:23.100
Yes.

05:23.100 --> 05:25.800
Eh, I can't.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.733
- No.
- But...

05:30.233 --> 05:32.800
it's smoked salmon with cream cheese.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.300
Smoked salmon?

05:35.800 --> 05:37.800
Oh, I can't say no to that.

- [ Girl Screams ]
- [ Children Groaning ]

05:50.333 --> 05:52.767
- Courtney, get it off me!
- It's okay. It's okay.

05:52.767 --> 05:54.967
- It's just a corn snake.
- [ Sighs ]

05:54.967 --> 05:57.033
[ Moans ]

05:57.033 --> 06:00.533
I'm sorry, Mr. Finley.
I had no idea.

06:00.533 --> 06:02.733
Someone must have put it in my bag.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.933
Oh, man. Hey, j-j-just
take that away from me.

06:07.933 --> 06:10.167
- Please.
- It's harmless, really.

06:10.167 --> 06:13.300
- You-- You're not scared?
- No.

06:13.300 --> 06:17.133
I love all creatures.
Would you like to touch it?

06:17.133 --> 06:19.433
Well, I don't-- You know,
I don't-- I-- No.

06:19.433 --> 06:22.033
I understand your reluctance,
Mr. Finley.

06:22.467 --> 06:26.867
- Most people are afraid of snakes.
- Huh? Great idea, Hat.

06:27.367 --> 06:29.667
[ Moans ]

06:29.667 --> 06:32.667
You're getting all tied up
there, aren't you?

Hey!

06:56.567 --> 06:59.067

06:59.067 --> 07:01.067
- I got another idea, Eddie, my boy.
- Forget it.

07:01.067 --> 07:03.567
- Ah, this one's a beauty.
- No, thanks.

07:03.567 --> 07:05.067
That's the thing about
computers these days.

07:05.567 --> 07:08.067
Anyone can figure 'em out.

07:08.067 --> 07:12.567
Oh. Sorry, Eddie.
I-- I didn't see you.

07:12.567 --> 07:16.067
- I'm very sorry.
- What's your idea?

07:36.200 --> 07:39.000
- No way. I ain't doing it.
- Chicken.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.333
I know you are, but what am I?

07:40.333 --> 07:42.533
That's so funny I forgot to laugh.
You get it.

07:42.533 --> 07:45.300
- No way.
- Are you scared of everything?

07:45.700 --> 07:47.667
- No.
- Then prove it.

07:51.233 --> 07:53.667
Okay, you got something
to put it in?

08:02.400 --> 08:06.400
- I don't wanna do it.
- Come on, man. It's just a bug.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.400
It's a bug.

08:14.067 --> 08:17.033
- [ Chattering ]
- Hurry up, Eddie!

08:17.033 --> 08:19.933
- I'm trying.
- [ Woman ] You've thought about this?

08:20.367 --> 08:23.667
- [ Courtney ] It's really fun.
- This really isn't necessary.

08:25.000 --> 08:27.833
[ Door Unlocking ]

08:31.767 --> 08:34.200
Courtney, you know you don't
need to do any extra work.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.200
You've already got an A-plus.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.467
Yeah, but I was hoping
I could get something higher.

08:38.467 --> 08:40.533
- There is no such thing.
- Are you sure?

08:40.533 --> 08:43.299
We're in science class.
We can invent one.

08:43.299 --> 08:45.133
I hate her.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.600
Courtney, I wish there
were more students like you.

08:47.600 --> 08:51.200
And I wish there were
more teachers like you.

09:05.067 --> 09:07.167
- Quit tickling my leg.
- Shh! I'm not.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.733
You're not?

09:09.733 --> 09:12.567

- It's okay. It's okay.
- [ Panting ]

09:24.467 --> 09:26.800
- Would you like a ride home?
- No, it's okay.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.667
I like to walk. It gives me
time to think about my classwork.

09:30.167 --> 09:32.800
Don't forget to shut the door
behind you when you're through.

09:33.233 --> 09:35.233
[ Gasps ]
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

09:35.233 --> 09:37.667
- Oh, gosh.
- It's okay. Shh.

09:37.667 --> 09:40.967
- Don't yell. It scares. That's when it--
- Help!

09:40.967 --> 09:43.833
[ Together ]
Help! Help!

09:44.333 --> 09:46.100
Help!

09:51.333 --> 09:53.000
Don't move.

10:00.833 --> 10:04.600
Hello. It's okay,
tarantula. It's okay.

10:05.100 --> 10:09.600
Tarantulas hardly ever bite. And
even if they do, it doesn't hurt.

10:10.100 --> 10:13.333
Like the snake,
it's a misunderstood creature.

10:13.333 --> 10:14.833
Would you like to touch it?

10:14.833 --> 10:18.167
- No. It's okay.
- Uh, no, no. We'll take a rain check.

[ Gurgling ]

10:34.567 --> 10:37.067
[ Ms. Prince ] Here's today's
Muddy Creek Observer.

10:37.567 --> 10:40.433
"The Legend of the Mud Monsters"
was written by Courtney King.

10:40.433 --> 10:42.933
"Coney" again?

10:44.933 --> 10:47.433
I think we should
all give Courtney a hand.

10:50.767 --> 10:54.133
It's not every day we have a
famous writer in our midst.

10:54.133 --> 10:56.633
Well, I'm not exactly famous yet.

10:56.633 --> 10:58.133
Well, you're published.
That's the first step.

10:58.633 --> 11:00.500
[ Scoffs ] Spare me.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.367
Eddie.

11:03.367 --> 11:07.500
As a published author, what would
you say the value of writing is?

11:07.500 --> 11:12.100
Well, when I was a child, I used
to be afraid of mud monsters.

11:12.100 --> 11:14.300
But as I started to do
my research, I realized...

11:14.300 --> 11:16.800
that there was nothing
to be afraid of.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.433
I was basically afraid
of the unknown.

11:18.433 --> 11:20.933
So I should say thank you,
Ms. Prince.

11:20.933 --> 11:23.033
Thank me? Why?

11:23.033 --> 11:25.533
I guess writing this report
helped me confront my fears.

11:25.967 --> 11:27.333
Now I'm not scared of anything.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.667
- [ Gasps ]
- [ Ms. Prince ] Very good.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.500
[ Whispering ] Now I know
how we can get Courtney.

11:38.800 --> 11:42.233
Look, all I'm saying is if
you're not scared, prove it.

11:42.733 --> 11:45.233
- How?
- Meet Eddie and me at Muddy Creek.

11:45.233 --> 11:47.033
After school.
We dare you. Right, Eddie?

11:47.033 --> 11:50.400
- Yeah.
- You two don't ever give up, do you?

11:50.400 --> 11:52.400
See, I told you she was
afraid of mud monsters.

11:52.400 --> 11:56.733
No. I'll be there.
I promise.

11:58.733 --> 12:02.233
- [ Bell Rings ]
- [ Snapping Fingers ]

12:11.633 --> 12:15.600
- How come I have to be the mud monster?
- 'Cause it was my idea.

12:16.067 --> 12:19.667
- So how do I look?
- Like-- Like someone covered with mud.

12:24.267 --> 12:26.700
You think she believes in them?
You know, deep down?

12:26.700 --> 12:30.667
She will after tonight.
If you'll just hold still.

12:36.233 --> 12:39.033
Yep, that's better.

13:08.367 --> 13:10.867
Okay, when she shows up
I'll bring her here,

13:10.867 --> 13:11.867
and you jump out and tell her

13:11.867 --> 13:13.867
you're gonna turn her
into a mud monster.

13:13.867 --> 13:17.367
I can't wait to see it. Big, brave
Courtney begging for her life.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.867

to be hiding.

- There's no such thing.

- I saw, Eddie.

You're just imagining.

16:31.567 --> 16:33.933
It was probably just the fog
in the swamp or something.

16:35.800 --> 16:39.033
I'm scared, Eddie.

16:42.533 --> 16:46.000
Isn't it interesting how people
keep on trying something...

16:46.500 --> 16:48.533
that has no chance of succeeding.

16:48.533 --> 16:53.300
Here we have two adolescents of
average or below intelligence...

16:53.300 --> 16:54.800
trying to outwit an adolescent

16:54.800 --> 16:57.800
of much higher than
average intelligence.

16:58.300 --> 17:01.100
I'm not bragging.
I'm just stating the facts.

17:01.100 --> 17:03.100
But what is really interesting
is your persistence--

17:03.100 --> 17:05.900
what keeps you going.

17:05.900 --> 17:10.300
It reminds me of some lab rats
I once saw in some science experiment.

17:10.300 --> 17:11.300
Lab rats?

17:11.300 --> 17:13.467
They keep on shocking
the poor little things,

17:13.467 --> 17:16.467
but they keep on insisting
to have their food pellet.

17:16.467 --> 17:19.200
- [ Eddie ] Can you believe her?
- Kind of pathetic when you think about it.

17:23.267 --> 17:26.300
- M-Mud!
- Mud?

17:26.700 --> 17:31.167
- M-Monster!
- Oh-ho. A mud monster.

17:31.167 --> 17:33.900
A mud monster is behind me.
I see.

17:35.367 --> 17:37.500
[ Low Growl ]

17:40.467 --> 17:43.700
- You are right.
- [ Growls ]

17:43.700 --> 17:45.600
Uh-uh. Don't interrupt.
I can feel your anger.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.667
- [ Sighs ]
- What?

17:48.667 --> 17:50.267
But why?
That's what we need to look at.

17:50.767 --> 17:53.033
Now, isn't that better?

17:55.033 --> 17:58.333
Now, we have to talk about
your aggressive behavior.

17:58.333 --> 18:01.267
[ Sighs ]

18:01.767 --> 18:03.267
You can't expect
sympathy from people

18:03.267 --> 18:05.467
if you're always
attacking them, you know.

18:05.467 --> 18:10.400
Well-adjusted monsters just
don't do those sorts of things.

18:10.400 --> 18:14.400
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but inside this monster we all see,

18:14.400 --> 18:17.400
I think we have an
emotionally wounded creature.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.100
It wasn't until
I admitted to myself...

18:20.100 --> 18:23.100
that there was nothing wrong
with being perfect...

18:23.100 --> 18:25.600
that I was able
to totally accept myself.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.600
It means to work
on your self-growth...

18:27.600 --> 18:31.167
and definitely do something
about your impulsive behavior.

18:31.167 --> 18:34.133
Hear me out.
Hello there. Hello.

18:35.633 --> 18:38.133
Are you even listening to me?

18:43.500 --> 18:45.433
[ Camera Shutter Snaps ]

18:45.933 --> 18:47.433
[ Man ] Courtney,
when did you first realize

18:47.433 --> 18:49.933
you were dealing with a monster?

18:49.933 --> 18:53.833
As I told the president earlier,
when he phoned to congratulate me,

18:53.833 --> 18:55.200
I always suspected that
there might be some truth

18:55.200 --> 18:57.533
to the legend of the mud monster.

18:57.533 --> 19:00.033
I think I'm gonna be sick.

19:00.033 --> 19:02.533
Only Courtney could talk
a mud monster to death.

19:02.533 --> 19:06.133
I also told him that being a hero
comes with lots of responsibility.

19:06.567 --> 19:09.033
That's why saving the lives
of two frightened little boys,

19:09.467 --> 19:12.533
Hat and Eddie,
was something I had to do.

19:12.533 --> 19:14.500
- [ Groans ]
- Oh, brother.

19:14.500 --> 19:19.567
I'll never forget the look of
absolute terror in their little faces.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.967
[ Camera Shutter Snaps ]

19:22.967 --> 19:25.400
[ Thunder Rumbling ]

19:25.400 --> 19:27.900
Oh, darn. The rain.

19:27.900 --> 19:31.133
Shall we reconvene at city hall?

19:46.500 --> 19:50.500
- Some monster!
- Yeah. Just a big dirt clod.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.633
I really thought we had her
this time. Let's just admit it.

20:22.633 --> 20:25.533
- We'll never beat Courtney.
- Yeah.

20:28.733 --> 20:32.733
- Shouldn't we get out of the rain?
- What for?

20:32.733 --> 20:35.233
Yeah.

20:35.233 --> 20:39.733
I just gotta tell you,
Eddie. Life just isn't fair.

20:39.733 --> 20:41.733
Oh, thanks, man.

20:41.733 --> 20:44.700
- [ Roaring ]
- [ Both Screaming ]
