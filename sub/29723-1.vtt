Please, brother.

<i> (reporters): The government</i>

- That's nice.
- That's...
that's a lovely name, yeah.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.497
- Mm-hmm. And you said
he's just six weeks?

06:06.367 --> 06:07.666
- Yes.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.408
- Oh, yeah.
- The money, then?

06:16.410 --> 06:19.578
- Yeah. Okay.
- We are both working and study.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.781
It's just until
we finish our studies

06:22.783 --> 06:25.083

(Tom Jones's Once Upon A Time)
- Eni, get from behind there.

07:07.428 --> 07:10.095
(baby crying)
That's why they'd all better
behave themselves

07:10.097 --> 07:12.764
and do what Mummy tells them,
else they'll all be back

07:12.766 --> 07:15.200
on the next banana boat
to bloody Wooga Wooga land.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.369
- I made the tea last time.
Do it yourself.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.704
- Mingle, shut that baby up.
Keep your mouth shut.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.807
- Read this for me, babes.
Me eyes hurt.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.409
- Don't know why you're lying.
Y'know you can't bleeding read.

07:24.411 --> 07:26.578
- "We are sorry...

07:26.580 --> 07:29.347
we could not come down again.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.516
We are working hard,

07:31.518 --> 07:33.752
and we'll try to see you soon."

07:33.754 --> 07:35.754
- Who's it from?
Which one is it?

07:35.756 --> 07:37.589
- Eni's mum.
- Eni's mum.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.624
- Blimey. Eni's parents
not coming down again.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.494
- They only live a couple
of hours away in London.

07:42.496 --> 07:45.964
Too bleeding busy
trying to become lawyers
instead of visiting their boy.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.333
Anyway.
Eni really gets on my nerves,
Lynn.

07:48.335 --> 07:50.435
- Thought you liked
having the kids.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.637
- I don't mind Dopey and Mingle,
his sisters
and the rest of them,

07:52.639 --> 07:54.906
but... he just rubs me
the wrong way.

07:54.908 --> 07:59.644
Y'know, scrounging for attention
all the time like he's special.
He's annoying.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.547
- Aw, you don't mean that, Ing.
- She's only jealous
'cause he's happy.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.049
- No, I ain't.

08:04.051 --> 08:06.585
He thinks he's better
than the rest of 'em.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.920
Look at him. Sits behind there,
talking to hisself,

08:08.922 --> 08:10.489
saying he's got
an imaginary friend.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.390
- So? What's wrong with that?

08:12.392 --> 08:16.828
- I got me an imaginary friend
and I call him Tom. Tom Jones.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.431
(laughter)
- I remember
your mother telling me

08:19.433 --> 08:21.800
you was like that as a toddler.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.602
Always in your own world.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.204
- Don't want none of my kids
growing up soft, that's all.

08:26.206 --> 08:29.574
- No chance of that.
- How much d'you say his parents
give you for Eni Ing?

08:29.576 --> 08:31.510
- £13 a week for him
and his sisters.

08:31.512 --> 08:33.945
- Mind yourselves.
- Plus their family-allowance
books.

08:33.947 --> 08:37.849
- What?
- Yeah, government gives them £5
vouchers per week, per kid.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.851
- I could do with a bit of that.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.387
My Tony's been made
redundant again, ain't he?

08:42.389 --> 08:45.323
- Lynn, you can't pick 'em up
and drop 'em as you please.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.792
- Nah, especially when you got
social workers up your arse.

08:47.794 --> 08:49.060
- They ain't bleedin' toys,
Lynn.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.529
- Right.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.332
Divvy cods!
Get from behind there.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.635
- Just needs to be put to work,

08:56.637 --> 08:58.904
instead of sitting behind
that sofa daydreaming,
playing silly buggers all day.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.540
- Yeah. No more silly buggers.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.675
(man shouting)

09:03.677 --> 09:05.844
(rock music)

09:05.846 --> 09:08.513
D'you wanna be
Mummy's favourite?

09:08.515 --> 09:11.016
Do ya? Go on.

09:14.588 --> 09:16.454
(baby crying)
Shhh.

09:30.470 --> 09:32.571
(man shouting)

09:32.573 --> 09:34.706
(baby fussing)

09:35.075 --> 09:36.708
Shhh.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.423
- Oi!
- Little bleeder!

09:51.425 --> 09:53.792
I told you not to touch
anything, didn't I?!

09:53.794 --> 09:56.761
Git, wait till I get you home,
embarrass me like that.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.065
I'm sorry.
I keep telling him not to touch.
I'm really sorry.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.835
Come here.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.871
We had to do it so we didn't
get caught, alright?

10:07.507 --> 10:10.075
Nearly got Mummy in trouble,
didn't you? Eh? Silly?

10:10.077 --> 10:13.311
Got to do better if you want
to be Mummy's favourite.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.447
Right, you lot,
I want this place spick'n'span.

10:15.449 --> 10:18.383
I don't want
no stuck-up social workers
saying my house ain't clean.

10:18.385 --> 10:21.286
I have to see if I can get
some money out of 'em.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.054
Jack, you use that
for the bloody dog.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.590
- I'll use 'em on bloody you
in a minute. Get here.

10:25.592 --> 10:28.593
It's alright
all the bloody same, innit?
You don't mind, do ya, kids?

10:28.595 --> 10:30.428
(kids): No, Dad!
(laughter)

10:30.430 --> 10:31.796
- Oi, Herberts.
When you're done,

10:31.798 --> 10:33.932
I want you to get round
to Aunty Lynn's.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.101
Don't want them knowing
how many of youse I got.

10:36.103 --> 10:39.571
- Mum, how comes Madam
doesn't have to get
her hair cut?

10:39.573 --> 10:43.408
- Don't you worry about Madam.
Any dirt, any misbehaving,

10:43.410 --> 10:46.878
I'll have 'em takes youse all
back to Wooga Wooga land.
(kids): No!

10:46.880 --> 10:50.949
- What's that? Ah!
- Oh, my God, it's a mouse!
Kill it! Kill it!

10:50.951 --> 10:53.451
- I can't.
- Jack! Kill it.

10:53.453 --> 10:54.719
Make it go outside.

10:54.721 --> 10:55.954
- It ain't gonna bloody
hurt you.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.789
It's just come for a haircut.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.232
- We love you, Mum.
(laughter)

11:09.536 --> 11:10.969
- And what is your name?

11:10.971 --> 11:12.570
- Oi.
- Madam.

11:12.572 --> 11:15.540
- Well, you're a good,
clean girl, Madam.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.842
- Leave me alone.
(Ingrid chuckling)

11:17.844 --> 11:19.711
- No lice or ringworm,

11:19.713 --> 11:21.246
and their general health
seems fine.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.214
- I keep my kids bloody clean.
- Mrs. Carpenter,

11:23.216 --> 11:25.884
when did you last speak
to the families of the children?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.852
- I ain't heard from his at all.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.455
The others, I ain't heard
or received nothing from 'em
in ages.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.457
- The farming phenomenon.
- The what?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.426
- Nigerian families fostering
their children out

11:34.428 --> 11:37.195
to white families
across the country -
it's what we term it.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.265
- They ain't bleedin' potatoes.
Why don't you call 'em
something friggin' sensible?

11:40.267 --> 11:43.168
- The practice has been tripling
in the last six months.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.969
And regrettably,
the welfare resources

11:44.971 --> 11:47.505
aren't designed
to extend to private fostering.

11:47.507 --> 11:50.809
- What d'you expect me to do?
I got nothing to feed them on.
- You can't cope?

11:50.811 --> 11:53.178
- No, I'm saying I could use
a bit of help.

11:53.180 --> 11:55.080
- If we can't track down
the natural parents,

11:55.082 --> 11:57.215
the new directives tell us
to place the children

11:57.217 --> 11:58.717
in care institutions
until they're deported

11:58.719 --> 12:00.852
to the closet known relative--
- Wait. Hang on.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.488
They were born here,
they're British.
You can't deport them.

12:03.490 --> 12:05.657
- Well, we hope
it won't come to that.

12:05.659 --> 12:07.625
We all want the best for
the children, Mrs. Carpenter.

12:07.627 --> 12:09.961
But it's a question of budget.

12:09.963 --> 12:14.766
You say your husband is
a long-distance lorry driver,
away for days at a time.

12:14.768 --> 12:16.301
Will he be coming today?

12:16.303 --> 12:18.503
We did ask to see
the both of you.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.238
- He's at work.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.906
Someone's gotta feed 'em.

12:29.449 --> 12:33.151
¶ Your love
is everything to me ¶

12:35.255 --> 12:39.457
¶ With you
is where I long to be ¶

12:41.261 --> 12:43.595
¶ You're always on my mind ¶

12:43.597 --> 12:45.964
¶ So don't waste
precious time ¶¶

12:45.966 --> 12:49.234
What you doing home?
(turning music off)
You should be at school.

13:03.517 --> 13:06.785
Go on. You can have
one of your funny half-hours.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.956
(up-tempo music)

13:11.958 --> 13:15.059
¶ I gave my mom a gift
and she gave me a smile ¶

13:15.061 --> 13:18.163
¶ Now I got this feeling
that I ain't had in a while ¶

13:18.165 --> 13:20.665
¶ Oh yeah ¶
¶ Oh yeah ¶

13:20.667 --> 13:23.668
¶ Feelin' alright oh yeah ¶
¶ Oh yeah ¶

13:23.670 --> 13:25.570
That's a good girl.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.339
- Hmm.
(Ingrid chuckling)
- Eating Daddy's dinner.

13:28.341 --> 13:32.076
Lucky Daddy didn't eat his food
last night, eh?

13:32.078 --> 13:35.213
Mummy's baby, eh? Mm.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.915
(chuckling)

13:38.451 --> 13:40.285
¶ I woke up in the morning ¶

13:40.287 --> 13:43.421
¶ And I saw in the end
She took the thing I gave her ¶

13:43.423 --> 13:45.657
Oi! Don't forget your sisters.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.392
(kids shouting)

13:47.394 --> 13:50.161
¶ I'm feelin' ashamed
Oh no ¶

13:50.163 --> 13:54.666
¶ Sho enough
she gave my heart away ¶

13:54.668 --> 13:56.501
¶ No longer Mommy's good books ¶

13:57.204 --> 14:00.371
- I told you not to walk
down here, coon! Didn't I?

14:00.373 --> 14:01.940
¶ That ain't right ¶

14:05.412 --> 14:08.112
Go get him, Sheila!!
(screaming)

14:08.114 --> 14:10.782
- It's okay, Eni. It's okay.
- It's been a bloody hour
already.

14:10.784 --> 14:13.852
Look at his leg.
I'll sort it me friggin' self.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.087
- We'll wait for Jack.
- Jack ain't here!

14:16.089 --> 14:19.624
We've been waiting for Jack
half an hour.
It's an hour, it's an hour.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.726
He said half an hour
he'd be here.

14:21.728 --> 14:24.662
(children shouting)
- What the fuck's going on here,
then?

14:24.664 --> 14:26.798
- Them bastard Smiths
set a dog on him.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.367
I've had him down the hospital.
He's had 15 stitches.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.836
What you gonna do?
- They should've stopped it.

14:31.838 --> 14:34.939
- Right. Nothing, then, is it?
- That bleeding dog
needs putting down.

14:35.742 --> 14:39.711
- They set a dog on your son,
and your gypsy cousins
just stood there and watched.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.647
Now you fucking go out there
and kill it.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.284
I mean it, Jack.
Slit its fucking throat.
I want it dead!

14:46.286 --> 14:47.819
- Shut it.

14:51.324 --> 14:53.224
Right, you, come on, get up.

14:58.765 --> 15:01.499
Now, I've told you, boy,
ain't I?
You gotta stop your whining.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.269
- Jack!
- I'm not having him come home
balling like a friggin' baby.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.838
Now, you got a choice.
You either go out there
and get beat,

15:06.840 --> 15:09.007
or come in here and get beat.
Now get out there--

15:09.009 --> 15:11.009
- Don't have him fighting.
- Send him out there
by himself?

15:11.011 --> 15:12.644
- He's got to learn
to fight for himself.

15:12.646 --> 15:15.146
Now, you pick up a brick
and you hit 'em.

15:15.849 --> 15:19.284
And don't come back
till you've done it. Alright?

15:19.286 --> 15:20.752
Now go on.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.154
- Eni, don't go out there.
- Jack.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.056
- Look, make me a sandwich.
- He's only a kid!

15:25.058 --> 15:26.858
- Jack!

15:34.634 --> 15:36.434

¶ The rain's gone away
We're going out... ¶

16:00.593 --> 16:02.093
- Eni, where are we going?

16:02.095 --> 16:04.629
- I'm looking for the end
of the rainbow.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.763
¶ We're going out to play ¶¶

16:05.765 --> 16:07.665
- Eni, I'm hungry.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.508
- Is that it?
- It's just a puddle.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.043
I want to go home.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.349
- Look, there's a rainbow.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.819
- Wow, there's a rainbow.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.844
- What's he doing?
- He's making a wish.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.445
- Let's join him.

17:08.962 --> 17:11.529
- It's gone.
(all): What?!

17:11.531 --> 17:13.698
- Let's go.
- Eni, what did you wish for?

17:13.700 --> 17:17.368
- I wished for a dog.
- I wished for a--
- Last one home's a fathead.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.237
(excited chatter)

17:21.508 --> 17:23.241
- You guys wish too much.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.818
(up-tempo music)

17:37.223 --> 17:39.157
(man shouting)

17:56.743 --> 17:59.744
- You should've wished
that we'd all be happy.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.379
- Well done, baba.

18:01.381 --> 18:02.914
- Well done,
baba.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.649
(indistinct chatter)

18:10.390 --> 18:11.823
- Eni, come.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.696

18:23.937 --> 18:26.170
Daddy's home.
(chuckling)

18:26.172 --> 18:28.206
(speaking Yoruba)

18:29.742 --> 18:32.043
- Children,
these are your sisters.

18:32.045 --> 18:33.578
Hmm?

18:33.580 --> 18:36.280
Now, make yourself at home.
Come, come, come.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.450
- Eni, come and greet
your grandfather.

18:41.187 --> 18:42.753
Eni.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.455
Here, come, come.

18:44.457 --> 18:47.358
- Enitan, go and say hello
to your grandfather.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.927
- Look at his face.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.697
They fear their own kind.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.416
- You must do the prayer ritual

19:12.418 --> 19:15.219
to bring his ancestral spirit
back home.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.455

Answer me. What is your name?

21:25.585 --> 21:27.318
So you don't want to talk?

21:28.755 --> 21:31.122
Go stand on one leg
in that corner.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.891
We will teach you to talk today,
Mr. English.

21:37.830 --> 21:39.430
You will talk.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.032
You will talk.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.238

21:51.077 --> 21:54.645
Now come here. Get up. Come.

21:57.250 --> 21:58.649
Come here.

22:02.255 --> 22:05.389
You will talk today.
You hear me?

22:06.392 --> 22:08.359
You will talk. Ah!

22:08.895 --> 22:11.962
- Femi, Femi--
- It took us everything
to get him in there.

22:11.964 --> 22:13.764
- Let's think about this
for a second.

22:13.766 --> 22:16.033
- What is there to think about?
We gave him everything.

22:17.437 --> 22:19.970
- We'll find him another school.
There's so many schools
out there.

22:19.972 --> 22:23.741
- Where, Tolu?
That was the third one.
I don't know what else to do.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.678
- Uh, okay,
we'll educate him ourselves--
- When, Tolu?

22:27.680 --> 22:30.247
We are both working
night and day.

22:30.249 --> 22:33.384
Look,
the boy is beating teachers,

22:33.386 --> 22:34.952
and he still won't speak.

22:34.954 --> 22:37.455
Can't you see there's something
wrong with him?

22:37.457 --> 22:39.657
- Femi, Femi, wait. Please.

22:40.159 --> 22:43.227
I'm afraid. I don't want
to lose my son again.

22:43.229 --> 22:45.262
- Calm down.

22:45.264 --> 22:48.032
I don't want to lose him,
either, eh?

22:48.968 --> 22:51.635
But I don't want my son
to end up a dullard.

22:51.637 --> 22:56.040
If he stays here, we know that
he's going to become a ruffian.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.376
Please.
- Remember what Elijah said.

22:58.378 --> 23:01.879
He needs to be here.
He has to be here.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.514
He told us.

23:03.516 --> 23:07.084
- But at least if he goes there,
he will go to school.

23:08.521 --> 23:13.023
And maybe begin to speak again
and behave normal.

23:22.268 --> 23:23.667
- Look at that.

23:23.669 --> 23:26.070
There, that one. What's that?

23:26.072 --> 23:28.506
- It's their religion, ain't it?

23:28.508 --> 23:31.041
- "Vooju."
- That's wicked.

23:31.677 --> 23:34.245
- Ought to report 'em
to the authorities.
- No, Ing.

23:34.247 --> 23:37.415
- Lynn. Don't want the school
coming over here blaming me.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.017
That's another thing.
He's already behind in school.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.920
Reckon they couldn't find him
a school.

23:42.922 --> 23:46.290
Kept the girls, set him back.
Bloody ridiculous.

23:46.292 --> 23:50.327
He's got bruises,
keeps carving stuff over me
furniture and he won't talk.

23:50.329 --> 23:52.029
- What ya mean, he don't talk?

23:52.031 --> 23:54.131
- They said he hasn't said
a word in six months.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.333
- He ain't spoke a word
in six months?

23:56.335 --> 23:59.370
Like one of them
deaf and dumbs?
- That's what they said.

23:59.372 --> 24:01.172
- He ain't half-dark now, Ing.

24:01.174 --> 24:03.407
- Well, I expect it's the sun,
ain't it?

24:03.409 --> 24:05.242
Six months of that
turn anyone blue.

24:05.244 --> 24:07.077
- You'll be alright, though,
Ing.

24:07.079 --> 24:10.448
Run out of electric,
all you gotta do
is ask him to smile.

24:10.450 --> 24:12.783
He'd light up
the whole bleeding street.
(laughter)

24:14.587 --> 24:17.588
- Here, watch this. Eni?

24:17.590 --> 24:19.657
What'd you think
of Wooga Wooga land?

24:20.593 --> 24:22.927
Wooga Wooga man
cut his tongue out, see?

24:22.929 --> 24:24.662
That's what happens
if you don't behave.

24:24.664 --> 24:26.664
- Ain't right,
splitting 'em up like that.

24:26.666 --> 24:29.266
- It's kidnap, ain't it?
They're allowed to just take 'em
like that?

24:29.268 --> 24:31.635
- They're fostered,
not adopted. They can take 'em
whenever they want.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.557
- Still ain't right.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.141
- He'll be alright
now he's back, won't you, son?
We won't let 'em get ya.

24:38.144 --> 24:41.645

Don't like it, don't like it!

24:42.515 --> 24:45.182

and I'm coming to get you!

24:55.328 --> 24:57.595

24:59.465 --> 25:01.465

(laughter)

25:01.467 --> 25:05.436
- Eni, come back here
and do the Wooga Wooga dance
for Mummy.

of you.

That's why he's gotta sit

(indistinct chatter)

55:45.576 --> 55:47.242
(laughter)

55:51.716 --> 55:53.749

Shhh.

56:03.494 --> 56:04.893
What d'you want?

56:06.964 --> 56:08.597
- Are you Mrs. Carpenter?

56:10.501 --> 56:13.502
I came here to speak to you
about Eni.

56:13.504 --> 56:17.539
My name is Constance Dapo.
I'm his teacher.
I work at St. Georges.

56:17.541 --> 56:19.708
- What about him?

56:20.745 --> 56:22.478
- May I come in and talk?

56:22.480 --> 56:25.080
- I said what about him?

56:27.184 --> 56:29.685
- You are Mrs. Carpenter, yes?

56:31.956 --> 56:35.824
I... honestly only came here
out of concern for Enitan.

56:37.061 --> 56:38.894
Did you know he was suspended?

56:42.166 --> 56:44.700
Well, his suspension ended
a month ago,

56:44.702 --> 56:47.035
but he hasn't returned to class.

56:47.772 --> 56:50.973
He's also being harassed by
local hooligans and skinheads.

56:50.975 --> 56:54.910
- He can handle himself.
- I saw them violate him,
Mrs. Carpenter.

56:56.847 --> 56:58.814
They took everything
that boy had.

57:00.751 --> 57:04.953
Now, Eni is a promising student,
he's done well in his tests.

57:04.955 --> 57:07.890
- He can handle himself.
- I know what it feels like...

57:09.960 --> 57:11.827
...to hate what you are.

57:11.829 --> 57:13.662
I know that feeling,
Mrs. Carpenter.

57:13.664 --> 57:16.031
If we don't help him,
it will be a tragic waste--

57:16.033 --> 57:19.668
- Listen, you, I can take care
of me own kids.

57:20.171 --> 57:23.038
So piss off and find
some other charity case.

57:27.978 --> 57:29.945
- Who was that?

57:29.947 --> 57:33.248
- Some nosey cow
trying to teach me
how to look after me own kids.

57:34.585 --> 57:37.186
(sighing)
Now, where's that bloody
bastard?

57:37.188 --> 57:39.455
(warbling and shouting)

57:49.600 --> 57:52.501
- You want to be a skin,
you gotta get rid
of this coon bush.

57:52.503 --> 57:55.737
- Take it like a man, coon.
- Get that wog slap
off his head.

57:55.739 --> 57:57.973
- Ah!
- Do his eyebrows and all.
Go on.

57:57.975 --> 58:00.309
- Shave him! Shave him!
(shouting)

58:00.311 --> 58:02.544

58:06.851 --> 58:08.917

(indistinct chatter)

58:26.971 --> 58:29.438
(excited chatter)
(Skins shouting)

58:41.352 --> 58:44.152
- Yeah! Bloody Jonesy!

58:53.764 --> 58:55.531
- Why we always wear
tennis shirts?

58:56.600 --> 59:00.068
- Tennis?
- Fred Perry's a national hero,
coon.

59:00.971 --> 59:03.138
He's won three Wimbeldons.

59:03.140 --> 59:06.308
- Cloth of our country.
- That why we roll up our jeans
three times.

59:06.310 --> 59:08.810
It's a tribute to what's great
about this country.

59:10.748 --> 59:13.615
- Churchills. Winstons.

59:13.617 --> 59:15.083
- Dumb coon.

59:15.085 --> 59:18.387
- You should be ashamed.
Get a bloody job.

59:20.958 --> 59:23.258
- Let's go catch a monkey.

59:23.260 --> 59:25.327
(bell tolling)

59:31.602 --> 59:32.901
- Eni?

59:37.841 --> 59:39.741
Eni, why aren't you back
in school?

59:39.743 --> 59:41.443
Your suspension ended
a month ago.

59:52.156 --> 59:54.823
Eni, why are you doing this?

59:55.826 --> 59:57.793
You don't need to do this.

1:00:02.533 --> 1:00:03.832
Eni...

1:00:05.102 --> 1:00:06.835
You should be in school.

1:00:08.572 --> 1:00:12.040
Please, let's talk.
You can still call me anytime.

1:00:14.545 --> 1:00:17.679
(crying out)
(laughter)

1:00:20.250 --> 1:00:22.451
Get off me! Get off me!

1:00:23.387 --> 1:00:26.054

Get off me!

1:00:28.225 --> 1:00:29.625
(laughter)

1:00:31.395 --> 1:00:33.061
Eni, stop this!

1:00:34.531 --> 1:00:36.598
- Hello, mongrel.

1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:38.567

1:00:40.771 --> 1:00:43.071

1:00:45.743 --> 1:00:47.809
Look at those little titties.

1:00:47.811 --> 1:00:51.179
(laughter)
Come here, wog.
Let me give you a mongrel baby.

1:00:51.181 --> 1:00:53.582
Oh! You fucking cunt!

1:00:58.756 --> 1:01:01.156

1:01:01.158 --> 1:01:03.825
Come round here again

1:01:09.767 --> 1:01:11.433

1:01:19.743 --> 1:01:22.377
- Go on, run, you black cunt!

1:01:22.379 --> 1:01:24.179

1:01:34.758 --> 1:01:36.458
(laughter)

1:01:46.503 --> 1:01:49.538
- That's the last fuckin' time
I go bingo on a Thursday.

1:01:49.540 --> 1:01:53.175
- I reckon Dobsy's shagging
the bingo caller.
Cow always wins the lucky draw.

1:01:53.177 --> 1:01:56.078

1:01:56.080 --> 1:01:57.946

(shouting in distance)
What's the matter with you?

1:02:12.296 --> 1:02:15.964
- No. I ain't going up there.
Not near those pigs.
They scare me.

1:02:15.966 --> 1:02:18.300
- It ain't safe round here

1:02:18.302 --> 1:02:20.669
Them and them other lot
of skinheads, them Grays,
run the bleeding streets now.

1:02:20.671 --> 1:02:22.304
- Always picking on coloureds,
ain't they?

1:02:22.306 --> 1:02:24.239
- Why don't they leave them

1:02:24.241 --> 1:02:26.441
String 'em up and shoot them.

1:02:34.852 --> 1:02:38.186

(laughter)

1:03:44.855 --> 1:03:46.655
(laughter)

1:04:08.378 --> 1:04:10.712
(Ingrid): ...bringing trouble

1:04:10.714 --> 1:04:13.348
Come on, darling,
let's go have a word with him.

1:04:13.350 --> 1:04:15.183
What's all this

1:04:15.185 --> 1:04:17.819
You've been lying to me.
I've had the school round.

1:04:20.157 --> 1:04:22.858
Go downstairs, babe.
Go on. Go on.

1:04:26.096 --> 1:04:28.830
What's all this shit
you got on my walls?

1:04:44.948 --> 1:04:47.716
You've been running
with those yobo skins, ain't ya?

1:04:47.718 --> 1:04:50.819
Fighting with them sailors.
I saw you down the docks.

1:04:53.390 --> 1:04:57.058
You better not bring
the bloody law down on me, boy.
I swear.

1:05:00.764 --> 1:05:02.430
- I am the law.

1:05:13.977 --> 1:05:17.646
- Ya know I always tried for ya,
didn't I, eh, boy?

1:05:18.949 --> 1:05:20.749
(sighing)

1:05:20.751 --> 1:05:22.884
Look, instead of running
with them yobo skins,

1:05:22.886 --> 1:05:25.820
why don't you come out
with Mummy like you used to?

1:05:25.822 --> 1:05:27.956
Who's that?

1:05:27.958 --> 1:05:30.258
Is that your girlfriend?

1:05:30.260 --> 1:05:31.826
She's nice.

1:05:33.096 --> 1:05:36.031
You could, um, you could...
give me that necklace I liked.

1:05:36.033 --> 1:05:39.334
Go nice with them other pieces
you got me a while back.

1:05:41.371 --> 1:05:42.804
- My name's Eni.

1:05:45.375 --> 1:05:46.808
Not "boy."

1:05:48.679 --> 1:05:50.645
- You ungrateful git.

1:05:51.348 --> 1:05:53.548
I knew I should never have
had you back.

1:05:53.550 --> 1:05:57.085
I should let you stay
in Nigeria to rot,
let 'em cut you to ribbons.

1:05:58.622 --> 1:06:02.490
I put a roof over your head
and this is how you repay me?

1:06:02.492 --> 1:06:04.459
You don't appreciate
nothing I do.

1:06:05.595 --> 1:06:08.263
Well, you're 16 now.
You get caught again,
you're on your own.

1:06:08.265 --> 1:06:10.966
I can kick your arse out
on the streets to go hungry.

1:06:10.968 --> 1:06:13.134
Bloody parents of yours
don't give me nothing.

1:06:13.136 --> 1:06:16.571
Don't know why
I put up with you,
you selfish little bastard.

1:06:16.573 --> 1:06:18.840
Running with them yobo skins,
thinking you're something,

1:06:18.842 --> 1:06:21.376
beating up your own kind,
thinking they want you!

1:06:21.378 --> 1:06:23.244
They don't want you,
nobody wants you!

1:06:23.246 --> 1:06:26.247
I only took you so I could have
the bleedin' girls.

1:06:28.185 --> 1:06:31.252
I've got other kids
in this bedroom! Oh!

1:06:40.964 --> 1:06:43.231

1:07:02.753 --> 1:07:06.154

You know you used to eat them

1:07:06.156 --> 1:07:08.223
- Ah, piss off,

1:07:09.793 --> 1:07:12.127

1:07:12.129 --> 1:07:14.529

Ain't that your monkey sister?

1:07:16.299 --> 1:07:19.200
- Nah, coon ain't got nothing
to do with me.

1:07:22.172 --> 1:07:24.973
¶ You better be ready

1:07:24.975 --> 1:07:28.243
¶ 'Cause I am the law ¶

1:07:28.245 --> 1:07:30.745

Black bitch!

1:07:30.747 --> 1:07:32.614

1:07:34.084 --> 1:07:36.551

1:07:36.553 --> 1:07:38.820
¶ I'm a skinhead for life
Till death do us part ¶

1:07:40.590 --> 1:07:44.292

1:07:45.162 --> 1:07:48.096

but you still got heart ¶

1:07:48.098 --> 1:07:51.433

1:07:52.169 --> 1:07:54.602

1:08:13.156 --> 1:08:15.757
¶ Button your shirt

1:08:15.759 --> 1:08:17.759

1:08:27.838 --> 1:08:31.005
Time to teach
them Tilbury fuckers a lesson.

1:08:31.007 --> 1:08:34.042
- Come on, let's have it!!
(all roaring)

1:08:35.879 --> 1:08:38.313

1:08:51.461 --> 1:08:52.961
- Thanks, lover.
- Ah!

1:08:52.963 --> 1:08:55.497

- Fuck off.

1:08:55.499 --> 1:08:57.265
(laughter)

1:08:57.267 --> 1:08:59.167
- Fuck me.

1:08:59.169 --> 1:09:02.437
- Where'd he get it, anyway?
- Broke into Basildon Zoo.

1:09:02.973 --> 1:09:06.174
- Looks like he's in love
with it.
(indistinct chatter)

1:09:06.176 --> 1:09:08.243
Popping the question next,
Paula?

1:09:08.245 --> 1:09:10.812

(laughter)

1:09:15.852 --> 1:09:18.019

- Where d'ya think you're going,
coon?

1:09:28.498 --> 1:09:30.999
Chop you up like dogmeat, Sambo.

1:09:34.271 --> 1:09:36.237
Off you fuck, then.

1:09:44.514 --> 1:09:47.248
What the fuck are you doing,
running with that?

1:09:52.155 --> 1:09:55.390
- Entertainment.
- Starting a zoo, ain't we?

1:09:55.392 --> 1:09:57.659
Monkeys and snakes.
(laughter)

1:09:59.763 --> 1:10:01.829
- More like a friggin' circus.

1:10:05.936 --> 1:10:07.769
What's this I hear?

1:10:07.771 --> 1:10:11.172
You're messing
with Stan's boy Spika
over in Grays.

1:10:11.174 --> 1:10:13.374
Robbing a post office.

1:10:13.376 --> 1:10:16.377
Now the Gray Skins reckon
they're gonna come up here
and have a ruck.

1:10:16.379 --> 1:10:18.279
- They're all mouth.

1:10:18.848 --> 1:10:20.548
They won't do nothing.

1:10:20.550 --> 1:10:22.450
- Yeah.

1:10:22.452 --> 1:10:23.952
- What you doing?

1:10:23.954 --> 1:10:25.453
Hmm?

1:10:26.756 --> 1:10:28.990
What you doing,
fighting each other?

1:10:28.992 --> 1:10:32.393
You and Spika went
to fucking school together.

1:10:32.395 --> 1:10:34.329
You should be clubbing together.

1:10:40.670 --> 1:10:42.303
What's that?

1:10:42.305 --> 1:10:44.072
Eh?

1:10:44.074 --> 1:10:46.574
Coons...

1:10:46.576 --> 1:10:48.042

1:10:49.379 --> 1:10:51.379
They have their way,

1:10:51.381 --> 1:10:53.381
there won't be
a fucking England.

1:10:53.383 --> 1:10:55.250
- Tilbury Skins keep wogs out!

1:10:55.252 --> 1:10:58.253

Go on, you black bastard.

1:11:59.549 --> 1:12:01.316
- Makes you wanna escape,
don't it?

1:12:37.387 --> 1:12:40.321
Why'd you hang round with them
when they hate you?

1:12:57.841 --> 1:12:59.574
You ain't like them.

1:13:01.978 --> 1:13:03.644
You're better.

1:13:05.382 --> 1:13:09.250
I can see it... in your eyes.

1:13:21.264 --> 1:13:22.897
You scared about Levi?

1:13:24.601 --> 1:13:26.334
He don't care about me.

1:13:27.504 --> 1:13:29.437
He don't care about nothing.

1:13:32.375 --> 1:13:34.108
I seen you looking at me.

1:13:36.179 --> 1:13:37.912
I know you like me.

1:13:47.657 --> 1:13:49.824
Oil and water don't mix.

1:13:51.928 --> 1:13:53.561
Nah.

1:13:54.764 --> 1:13:56.631
You're pure...

1:13:56.633 --> 1:13:58.566

1:14:01.771 --> 1:14:03.304
Like me.

1:16:27.584 --> 1:16:29.250
Bloody animals.

Not you, you black bastard.

1:16:50.673 --> 1:16:52.306

1:16:58.748 --> 1:17:00.948

1:17:00.950 --> 1:17:03.584

Alright, darling,

You can't go out there!

1:18:04.414 --> 1:18:06.881
He ain't coming out,
so you can fuck off.

1:18:06.883 --> 1:18:08.916

Pay for that, you spineless git.
Wait till my Jack gets home.

Tilbury: kill them all!
Tilbury: kill them all!...

1:19:21.891 --> 1:19:24.792
- That's why no one messes
with his girl.

1:19:29.198 --> 1:19:33.033
- Told him it's too early
for a rematch.
We're still fucking hurt.

1:19:34.270 --> 1:19:37.404
- They've probably pulled out
everything they've got.

1:19:37.406 --> 1:19:39.373

1:20:09.806 --> 1:20:12.239
I'll have him arrested,
that's what I'll do.

1:20:12.241 --> 1:20:14.041
- You what?

1:20:14.043 --> 1:20:16.143
- I'm gonna set the law on him,
have him arrested,

1:20:16.145 --> 1:20:18.612
and I'll call
his Nigerian parents
to come and take him back.

1:20:18.614 --> 1:20:20.080
- You sure?

1:20:20.082 --> 1:20:22.716
- We're gypsies.
We don't deal with the law.

1:20:22.718 --> 1:20:25.152
(indistinct chatter)
- Come on.

1:20:27.490 --> 1:20:30.124
- You think Levi'll have him?

1:20:30.126 --> 1:20:32.827
That Masher's a fucking psycho.

1:20:32.829 --> 1:20:34.829
- I thought
he was still locked up.

1:20:39.268 --> 1:20:40.768
- Come on!!

1:20:42.371 --> 1:20:43.971

1:20:43.973 --> 1:20:46.807
(all chanting): We want the wog!
We want the wog!...

1:20:48.177 --> 1:20:52.012

'cause he burnt Spika!

1:20:53.950 --> 1:20:57.117
(chanting continues)

1:20:58.387 --> 1:20:59.887
- Got a bottle, coon?

1:21:02.758 --> 1:21:04.959
Just get him down.

1:21:04.961 --> 1:21:06.827
- Levi?
- What you doing?

1:21:06.829 --> 1:21:08.829
(chanting continues)
- Lev.

1:21:09.966 --> 1:21:11.665
You can't let the coon go.

1:21:13.769 --> 1:21:15.836
Lev! He's a coon!

1:21:16.572 --> 1:21:18.873

1:21:21.978 --> 1:21:24.378
Lev, what are you doing?

Tilbury Skins!...

1:21:29.418 --> 1:21:31.318

1:21:32.255 --> 1:21:35.456

1:21:48.204 --> 1:21:50.437

1:22:05.855 --> 1:22:08.555
- Yeah, yeah!

1:22:19.502 --> 1:22:21.035
(can clattering)

1:22:34.083 --> 1:22:36.116
(Ingrid): I want 'em arrested.

1:22:36.118 --> 1:22:38.552
They put a brick
through me window.
They've got hammers and knives.

1:22:38.554 --> 1:22:41.722
I'm scared they're gonna do me
and me kids an injury.
Lock 'em up.

1:22:45.294 --> 1:22:47.661
(music playing)
(Skins shouting)

1:22:50.599 --> 1:22:52.366

1:23:04.213 --> 1:23:07.614

1:23:16.492 --> 1:23:19.326
- I'll be in the fucking gazette
tomorrow!
(laughing)

1:23:20.963 --> 1:23:22.830
(skin shouting)

1:23:26.669 --> 1:23:28.702
- You let 'em beat me up.

1:23:28.704 --> 1:23:31.238
You left me.
(mutterings)

1:23:32.575 --> 1:23:34.141
(laughter)

1:23:37.079 --> 1:23:40.247
Why'd you leave me?
(laughter)

1:23:40.249 --> 1:23:45.586
- You think I'd let...
a fucking monkey lead Tilbury?

1:23:45.588 --> 1:23:47.021
(laughter)

1:23:50.960 --> 1:23:52.826
You black cunt.

1:23:56.766 --> 1:23:58.232
- Black cunt.

1:24:04.173 --> 1:24:05.806
Black cunt!

1:24:07.076 --> 1:24:09.276
Black fucking cunt!

1:24:15.951 --> 1:24:18.052
Sh-sh-shitter.

1:24:18.054 --> 1:24:20.254
- Oh...
- Let's kill the fucker.

1:24:20.256 --> 1:24:22.156
(all shouting)

1:24:28.764 --> 1:24:32.066
- Kill the black bastard.
(indistinct chatter)

1:24:50.853 --> 1:24:53.253
- Come on! Fuck!
(silent shouting)

1:24:53.255 --> 1:24:55.255
(crying out)
Come on!

1:24:55.257 --> 1:24:57.691
(grunting)

1:24:59.595 --> 1:25:00.994
(slow music)

1:25:08.871 --> 1:25:11.238
(screaming)
(groaning)

1:25:12.675 --> 1:25:15.275
(gasping)

1:26:12.768 --> 1:26:14.434
- Tilbury Skins.

1:26:15.771 --> 1:26:17.638
Tilbury Skins.

1:26:19.575 --> 1:26:21.308
Tilbury Skins.
(groaning)

1:26:23.312 --> 1:26:25.245
Tilbury Skins.

1:26:27.683 --> 1:26:29.116
Tilbury Skins.

1:26:30.853 --> 1:26:32.452
Tilbury Skins.

1:26:34.490 --> 1:26:36.590
Tilbury Skins...

1:26:36.592 --> 1:26:38.025
Tilbury Skins.

1:26:38.761 --> 1:26:40.460
Tilbury Skins.

1:26:40.829 --> 1:26:42.763
Tilbury Skins!

1:26:43.165 --> 1:26:44.898
Tilbury Skins!

1:26:45.601 --> 1:26:47.501
Tilbury Skins!

1:27:25.307 --> 1:27:28.308
- You haven't seen him!
You don't know
what you're talking about!

1:27:28.310 --> 1:27:29.710
- I do know.
(child screaming)

1:27:29.712 --> 1:27:31.144
- Alright, then.

1:27:32.581 --> 1:27:35.515
- Here, I've called the police.
Don't you come in here.

1:27:35.517 --> 1:27:37.818
I warned you don't come back.

1:27:42.157 --> 1:27:44.758
Don't you dare come in here.
Don't you dare come in here!

1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:46.560
- Stop it! Stop it!

1:27:46.562 --> 1:27:48.428
(shouting)

1:27:49.965 --> 1:27:54.201
- Leave him!
- Oh, my God, look at him!
I've called the police.

1:27:54.203 --> 1:27:55.836
- Ing, stop it!
- They're coming!

1:27:55.838 --> 1:27:57.804
Didn't think I'd do it,
but I have!

1:27:57.806 --> 1:28:00.240
I've called them
and they're coming!
(all shouting)

1:28:00.242 --> 1:28:03.443
- Stop it!! Stop it!
(siren wailing)
- They're here.

1:28:04.947 --> 1:28:06.747
(barking)
He's over there.

1:28:06.749 --> 1:28:09.316
- Where is he?
- He's there.
He's hid behind there.

1:28:11.754 --> 1:28:14.755
- Come here.
- Fuck off, you fucking pigs!

1:28:14.757 --> 1:28:17.157
Fuck off!!

1:28:17.159 --> 1:28:20.494
- I told you
not to call the law!
I told you!

1:28:20.496 --> 1:28:22.362
- Tilbury Skins!
- Shut it!

1:28:22.364 --> 1:28:24.097
- Tilbury Skins!

1:28:24.099 --> 1:28:27.668
Fuck you! You never loved me,
you fucking bitch!

1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:34.274
Give me my fucking snake!

1:29:01.637 --> 1:29:03.036
- GBH.

1:29:03.972 --> 1:29:06.306
No witnesses.
You're a lucky boy.

1:29:06.308 --> 1:29:09.109
Do you want
to file a complaint?

1:29:12.381 --> 1:29:14.014
You got one chance.

1:29:15.184 --> 1:29:17.818
I'd grab it with both hands
if I was you.

1:29:18.287 --> 1:29:20.921
- I hate these friggin' places.
What's taking so bloody long?

1:29:20.923 --> 1:29:23.590
- Defendant to be released
into the custody
of natural parents.

1:29:23.592 --> 1:29:25.492
- Jesus Christ, baby,
look at this.

1:29:25.494 --> 1:29:27.828
- See, I told ya. Look at him.

1:29:30.499 --> 1:29:32.766
- What have you done
to my son?
- Don't you go whining.

1:29:32.768 --> 1:29:35.202
You could've done a better job
on the pittance you sent me,

1:29:35.204 --> 1:29:36.670
you should have brought him up
yourself.

1:29:36.672 --> 1:29:38.538
- No, no, no,
we had an agreement.

1:29:38.540 --> 1:29:41.141
- You got what you paid for.
- I trusted you!

1:29:44.346 --> 1:29:45.746
- Are you okay?

1:29:45.748 --> 1:29:47.447
- Fuck off, coon.

1:29:48.183 --> 1:29:50.617
Tilbury Skins. Tilbury Skins!

1:29:50.619 --> 1:29:52.452
- Calm down.
- Keep wogs out! Tilbury Skins!

1:29:52.454 --> 1:29:54.321
- Calm down.
- Keep wogs out!
- Hey!

1:29:54.323 --> 1:29:56.256
(Talu screaming)

1:29:56.258 --> 1:29:57.924
For fucks...

1:29:57.926 --> 1:30:00.394
- Get off of me!
- Jack, leave him.

1:30:00.396 --> 1:30:01.828
Jack, don't get him.

1:30:45.541 --> 1:30:47.307
(groaning)
- Come on, then.

1:30:48.377 --> 1:30:51.244
- Wo...wo...woggy, woggies.
Sta-station.

1:30:51.246 --> 1:30:52.913
- Come on!
- Out, out.

1:30:52.915 --> 1:30:55.382
- Dumpty, Dumpty, Dumpty,
come on.

1:30:55.384 --> 1:30:58.218
- Social. Social. Woggy, coon.
- He said the wog's out.

1:30:58.220 --> 1:31:01.254
Broke out the pig station,
the old bills looking for him.

1:31:01.256 --> 1:31:03.457
- Social, social.
I saw him by the social.

1:31:03.459 --> 1:31:05.158
- Come on!
- He won't go home.

1:31:05.160 --> 1:31:08.628
The wog lover shopped him
to the old bill.

1:31:08.630 --> 1:31:10.931
- Fuck black cunt.
Levi's in hospital.

1:31:10.933 --> 1:31:13.266
You're the new leader now,
Bomb.

1:31:13.268 --> 1:31:15.235
- Yeah. I'll make it official.

1:31:17.172 --> 1:31:18.905
I know where the coon'll be.

1:31:45.767 --> 1:31:47.434
- Sign this, please.

1:32:01.083 --> 1:32:02.949
- You need to listen to me.

1:32:02.951 --> 1:32:05.752
He's assaulted two officers,
now they're on his toes.

1:32:05.754 --> 1:32:08.021
I need to know where he's gone.

1:32:40.956 --> 1:32:42.656
(Fathead): Come on!

1:32:43.292 --> 1:32:44.824
Th-this way.

1:32:49.131 --> 1:32:51.031
Co-come on.
(laughing)

1:33:09.451 --> 1:33:11.284
- Gonna skin him?
- Skin him.

1:33:11.286 --> 1:33:14.487
- Get that shiv
and stick it up him, yeah?
(laughter)

1:33:14.489 --> 1:33:17.157
- Skin him.
- Stop talking, mate.

1:33:18.260 --> 1:33:20.994
When I see him,
I'm gonna... rip him apart.

1:34:02.170 --> 1:34:03.603
Fuck.

1:34:04.973 --> 1:34:07.641
- Coon noosed himself.
- Swinging like a monkey.

1:34:09.244 --> 1:34:11.945
(sirens wailing)
- Police. Police.

1:34:12.948 --> 1:34:15.348
- Come on.
(sirens wailing)

1:35:23.585 --> 1:35:25.018
- Hello, Eni.

1:35:37.599 --> 1:35:40.433
I received a call
from your foster mother, Ingrid.

1:35:44.072 --> 1:35:46.506
I...

1:35:46.508 --> 1:35:49.642
I'd like to welcome you
to Brighty Institute, Eni.

1:35:52.581 --> 1:35:54.481
I'm a teacher here now.

1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:02.088
The mandate here at Brighty
is better suited to pupils

1:36:02.090 --> 1:36:04.224
who need extra support.

1:36:05.560 --> 1:36:07.227
Like you.

1:36:09.030 --> 1:36:12.232
Your Nigerian parents
have provided a stipendiary
for your education.

1:36:12.768 --> 1:36:16.503
This stipendiary enabled your
release from juvenile detention.

1:36:16.505 --> 1:36:18.571
A condition of this stipendiary
is that you study law,

1:36:18.573 --> 1:36:20.540
the same
as your Nigerian father.

1:36:20.542 --> 1:36:22.876
Books have been provided
for your studies.

1:36:24.212 --> 1:36:25.745
Eni?

1:36:28.250 --> 1:36:29.816
Eni.

1:36:30.952 --> 1:36:32.452
Eni.

1:36:33.588 --> 1:36:35.021
It's okay.

1:36:39.961 --> 1:36:41.828
I know it's a lot.

1:36:45.100 --> 1:36:48.535
I cannot know
all that you have been through,

1:36:48.537 --> 1:36:54.040
but I do know that every day
we get to make a new choice.

1:36:57.245 --> 1:36:58.945
If you trust me...

1:36:59.948 --> 1:37:02.448
...I will help you
make that choice.

1:37:05.587 --> 1:37:07.187
- Can't.

1:37:16.264 --> 1:37:17.897
- I believe in you.

1:37:20.969 --> 1:37:24.637
I believe
that you can make this turn...

1:37:26.575 --> 1:37:28.141
...if you try.

1:37:32.047 --> 1:37:34.147
I want us to try.

1:37:35.383 --> 1:37:36.850
Together.

1:37:40.956 --> 1:37:42.655
- I can't.

1:37:43.391 --> 1:37:44.824
I can't.

1:37:45.493 --> 1:37:47.026
Can't.

1:37:49.197 --> 1:37:51.331
- It's okay. It's okay.

1:37:56.171 --> 1:37:57.637
It's okay.

1:37:58.506 --> 1:37:59.873
Eni.

1:38:02.978 --> 1:38:04.444
It's okay.

1:38:11.353 --> 1:38:12.919
It's okay.

1:38:19.494 --> 1:38:21.127
This is your weapon now.

1:38:26.301 --> 1:38:28.034
- No!! Oh, God!

1:38:35.977 --> 1:38:37.443
- It's okay.

1:38:41.249 --> 1:38:43.182
(shushing)
- I'm nothing.

1:38:43.184 --> 1:38:45.585
- It's okay.
(shushing)

1:38:45.587 --> 1:38:46.986
It's okay.

1:38:48.156 --> 1:38:50.823
- I-I can't. I'm a coon.
- It's okay.

1:38:53.762 --> 1:38:55.428
- I'm a coon.

1:38:59.267 --> 1:39:01.034
I'm a coon.

1:39:25.327 --> 1:39:27.860
(soft music)

1:39:46.247 --> 1:39:48.948
(soft music continues)

1:40:46.975 --> 1:40:49.809
- There's nothing you cannot
achieve now, Enitan.

1:40:53.581 --> 1:40:55.448
(cheering)

1:41:09.597 --> 1:41:11.030
- Thank you.

1:41:43.264 --> 1:41:45.031
(applause)

1:43:27.969 --> 1:43:30.236
(soul music)

1:43:38.513 --> 1:43:41.180
¶ You know that your heart ¶

1:43:41.182 --> 1:43:44.317
¶ Belongs to me ¶

1:43:47.956 --> 1:43:49.956
¶ And that's a fact ¶

1:43:49.958 --> 1:43:53.826
¶ That a blind man can see ¶

1:43:57.365 --> 1:44:01.200
¶ You know I won't go astray ¶

1:44:01.836 --> 1:44:04.237
¶ I'm here to stay ¶¶

1:44:04.239 --> 1:44:06.305
(song continues)
