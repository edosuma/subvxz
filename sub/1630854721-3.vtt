00:00.800 --> 00:01.700
[April J] Previously

00:01.767 --> 00:02.600
<i>on</i> MILF Manor,

00:02.667 --> 00:04.767
Ladies, where's
all the men at?

00:04.767 --> 00:07.300
I think it's my time
to find love. I really do.

00:07.367 --> 00:10.200
<i>Are we looking for love?</i>
<i>Are we looking for romance?</i>

00:10.266 --> 00:12.467
All of my moments
have led me to this one.

00:12.967 --> 00:14.100
You're the baby.

00:14.166 --> 00:15.700
And you're gonna be 22, right?

00:15.767 --> 00:17.367
I'm gonna be 22.

00:17.367 --> 00:19.266
-Whoo!
-[laughs]

00:19.266 --> 00:22.066
April is the woman
who immediately caught my eye.

00:22.066 --> 00:23.166
<i>Maybe I could show her</i>

00:23.166 --> 00:24.800
what it's like
with a younger man.

00:26.767 --> 00:28.100
He's not going anywhere
near my mother.

00:29.166 --> 00:30.000
It's time to play
"Wall of Secrets."

00:30.000 --> 00:31.200
It's time to play
"Wall of Secrets."

00:31.266 --> 00:35.300
"I slept
with my son's best friend."
That's unacceptable.

00:35.367 --> 00:39.400
"I had a seven-woman orgy."
Could that be my mom?

00:39.467 --> 00:42.600
My secret is,
I slept with your best friend.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.867
[all exclaiming]

00:44.867 --> 00:47.600
<i>This one hurts deep. This one</i>
<i>I did not see coming at all.</i>

00:49.100 --> 00:50.767
I didn't expect this at all.

00:50.767 --> 00:53.000
<i>I'm hoping he will forgive me.</i>

00:54.300 --> 00:56.066
Have you ever dated
older women?

00:56.066 --> 00:58.266
I've had my eye on Jose
from day one.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.000
<i>I'm definitely going for it.</i>

01:00.000 --> 01:00.266
<i>I'm definitely going for it.</i>

01:00.266 --> 01:01.767
-Pola.
-Yes?

01:01.767 --> 01:03.066
I'm taking your son out
on a date.

01:03.066 --> 01:04.000
When?

01:04.000 --> 01:06.467
Kelle is not
the type of girl for Jose.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.166
I'm 100% sure.

01:09.166 --> 01:11.967
[in Spanish]

01:11.967 --> 01:13.667
[Kelle] <i>I don't know</i>
<i>what they're talking about.</i>

01:13.667 --> 01:15.266
-Maybe they're talking
about us.
-Yeah.

01:15.266 --> 01:17.467
-No speaking in Spanish!
We don't know.
-I heard...

01:17.467 --> 01:19.667
The majority doesn't know
what you're saying.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.867
She becomes like fire.

01:21.867 --> 01:24.166
-You're excluding people
is what you're doing.
-[Pola] No!

01:24.166 --> 01:26.867
-No.
-She's shouting at me,
just like...

01:26.867 --> 01:29.867
Hopefully, you're gonna
leave Kelle just, by the side.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.667
[bleeping]

01:47.300 --> 01:48.300
I'm being greedy right now.

01:48.367 --> 01:49.266
I want a pancake, too,

01:49.266 --> 01:50.266
but I already have
a quesadilla,

01:50.266 --> 01:51.700
which is a bread.

01:51.767 --> 01:55.767
Wow. I ate a pancake
and a half, almost, too,

01:55.767 --> 01:58.166
and I'm feeling like
it's too much carbs right now.

02:02.200 --> 02:04.266
[Kelle] <i>Last night,</i>
<i>with Pola and Stefany,</i>

02:04.266 --> 02:06.266
<i>there was</i>
<i>tensions running hot.</i>

02:06.266 --> 02:08.500
Speaking Spanish
after I asked them to stop?

02:08.567 --> 02:09.900
It's like, hello?

02:09.967 --> 02:11.900
I'm sorry,
should I tell you in Spanish,

02:11.967 --> 02:13.400
just shut the [bleep] up ?

02:13.467 --> 02:14.500
[chuckles]

02:14.567 --> 02:16.100
Just say that in Spanish.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.266
<i>Callate.</i>

02:17.266 --> 02:18.166
[chuckles]

02:19.166 --> 02:20.567
<i>Honestly, I really am</i>

02:20.567 --> 02:21.967
<i>over the whole</i>
<i>speaking Spanish thing.</i>

02:21.967 --> 02:22.867
<i>I could care less.</i>

02:22.867 --> 02:23.900
If they want
to keep speaking it,

02:23.967 --> 02:24.867
keep speaking it.

02:24.867 --> 02:26.000
If they want to stop,
they'll stop.

02:26.066 --> 02:27.100
They know how I feel.

02:27.166 --> 02:28.600
<i>I'm over it.</i>

02:28.667 --> 02:30.000
I'm definitely
going to apologize,

02:30.000 --> 02:30.767
I'm definitely
going to apologize,

02:30.767 --> 02:32.567
and bury the hatchet,
so we can move on.

02:41.367 --> 02:42.867
Oh, there she is.

02:42.867 --> 02:44.066
[Stefany] Hey, what's up?

02:45.266 --> 02:47.767
You ready to finish
what we started last night?

02:47.767 --> 02:50.500
-Girl, you're...
What's up?
-I'm just kidding.

02:50.567 --> 02:51.467
-Aw!
-I love you.

02:51.467 --> 02:53.266
I love you, too.

02:53.266 --> 02:54.700
No Spanish talk, right?

02:54.767 --> 02:56.367
[chuckles]

02:56.367 --> 02:57.533
You're silly.

02:57.533 --> 03:00.000
<i>I don't know if Kelle's</i>
<i>genuine this morning.</i>

03:00.000 --> 03:00.900
<i>I don't know if Kelle's</i>
<i>genuine this morning.</i>

03:00.967 --> 03:03.667
Maybe she's just trying
to get closer to our sons.

03:03.667 --> 03:06.266
I think at this point,
I just might

03:06.266 --> 03:07.900
keep my guard up,
a little bit,

03:07.967 --> 03:11.100
just to see what
this is all about.

03:12.000 --> 03:12.934
I'll teach you.

03:12.934 --> 03:15.300
Before we leave,
you're gonna learn it all.

03:15.367 --> 03:17.467
-[Kelle] Perfect. I love you.
- <i>Mamacita.</i>

03:17.467 --> 03:19.166
-Say <i>mamacita.</i>
- <i>Mamacita.</i>

03:19.166 --> 03:20.266
<i>Soy una mamacita.</i>

03:20.266 --> 03:21.266
<i>Soy yo mamacita.</i>

03:21.266 --> 03:22.400
[Stefany chuckles]

03:22.467 --> 03:24.000
[laughs]

03:24.667 --> 03:25.500
All right, girl.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.367
Literal, no. No, no.

03:28.367 --> 03:29.367
No, no, no. Of course.

03:33.700 --> 03:34.900
When she came close to me,

03:34.967 --> 03:36.300
I thought
she was gonna scream again.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.133
Good morning.

03:38.133 --> 03:39.567
-I apologize for last night.
-[Pola] No, don't worry.

03:40.867 --> 03:43.166
Kelle apologizing
made me realize

03:43.166 --> 03:44.900
that she is actually

03:44.967 --> 03:47.000
<i>smart enough</i>
<i>to recognize her mistakes,</i>

03:47.000 --> 03:49.266
<i>but at this point,</i>
<i>I'm also open</i>

03:49.266 --> 03:51.567
to getting to know
the other women in the villa.

03:55.367 --> 03:57.800
[Pola] <i>I'm watching Kelle,</i>
<i>because I just want</i>

03:57.867 --> 03:59.500
to make sure
everything is fine,

03:59.567 --> 04:00.000
and everyone is good.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.200
and everyone is good.

04:01.266 --> 04:02.667
I watch myself.

04:02.667 --> 04:04.066
I know. I know.

04:07.667 --> 04:08.667
Bam.

04:08.667 --> 04:09.767
[chuckles]

04:09.767 --> 04:11.367
Cheers to Spanish speaking.
[chuckles]

04:11.367 --> 04:12.300
[Kelle] Do you know what?

04:12.367 --> 04:14.066
The funny part is,
is it's my fault,

04:14.066 --> 04:16.700
because I actually took
Spanish classes, like...

04:16.767 --> 04:19.400
I started taking it,
and then I quit,

04:19.467 --> 04:20.467
and now, you know what?

04:20.467 --> 04:21.567
-It bit me on the ass.
-Yeah.

04:21.567 --> 04:24.700
So what happens if you meet
this, like, hot stud

04:24.767 --> 04:26.367
that only speaks Spanish?

04:27.467 --> 04:29.400
[Kelle] Then we just
make love. [laughs]

04:36.600 --> 04:37.500
How are you doing, king?

04:37.567 --> 04:39.066
Bro, I'm doing good.

04:39.066 --> 04:41.200
[Gabriel] The secrets
and [bleep] , you know,

04:41.266 --> 04:44.100
kind of hit home for people,
and I was like, "Damn.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.367
It might be a little annoying

04:45.367 --> 04:46.900
<i>finding out</i>
<i>your mom did that</i> [bleep] .

04:46.967 --> 04:48.567
<i>I was just checking in,</i>

04:48.567 --> 04:50.100
if you wanted
to talk about it,

04:50.100 --> 04:51.000
or something, you know?

04:51.066 --> 04:53.367
The most shocking secret,
for sure,

04:53.367 --> 04:56.667
was Jimmy finding out his mom
[bleep] his best friend.

04:56.667 --> 04:57.900
Did that kind of
bother you a little bit?

04:57.967 --> 04:59.567
Oh, yeah,
it bothers me, obviously.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.000
It's odd.

05:01.000 --> 05:01.900
For one, I didn't know,

05:01.967 --> 05:02.900
for two, it's supposed to,

05:02.967 --> 05:04.166
apparently, like,
my best friend,

05:04.166 --> 05:05.867
and for three,
now everybody knows.

05:05.867 --> 05:07.867
Imagine you in my shoes,
you know what I mean?

05:07.867 --> 05:09.100
[Gabriel] I'd be
pretty pissed.

05:09.166 --> 05:10.800
<i>If you made a mistake,</i>
<i>or something,</i>

05:10.867 --> 05:12.767
when I was younger,
whatever,

05:12.767 --> 05:15.567
but for you to, like,
tell me in front of strangers

05:15.567 --> 05:18.567
would kind of be,
like, embarrassing.

05:18.567 --> 05:21.200
I definitely would have said
something to my son

05:21.266 --> 05:24.900
if I was going to reveal that
to a group of people.

05:24.967 --> 05:26.266
-[Jimmy] Come on.
-I would probably fly home.

05:26.266 --> 05:27.200
-I'm not kidding.
-[Jimmy] Yeah.

05:27.266 --> 05:28.200
-I would fly home.
-[Jimmy] Yeah.

05:28.266 --> 05:29.467
Yeah.

05:29.467 --> 05:30.000
[Gabriel] <i>I think maybe</i>
<i>he should talk to Soyoung,</i>

05:30.000 --> 05:31.767
[Gabriel] <i>I think maybe</i>
<i>he should talk to Soyoung,</i>

05:31.767 --> 05:34.200
because that's a bomb to drop.

05:34.266 --> 05:36.867
If you just want to have
a conversation that's private,

05:36.867 --> 05:38.100
I'm always here to talk.

05:38.166 --> 05:41.867
I'm just trying to get
a little lit tonight.

05:41.867 --> 05:45.567
I think that
revealing the secret

05:45.567 --> 05:47.400
was very hard for me.

05:47.467 --> 05:49.567
I don't know how
you feel towards me.

05:49.567 --> 05:51.600
Are you saying
you don't know how I feel?

05:51.667 --> 05:53.266
How would you feel,
is the question.

05:53.266 --> 05:54.600
I'm angry.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.467
I don't know how
to even look at you,

05:56.467 --> 05:57.667
and talk to you

05:57.700 --> 06:00.000
in a sensible manner, where
I can be your son right now.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.700
in a sensible manner, where
I can be your son right now.

06:01.767 --> 06:04.000
I feel like
you didn't treat me
like your son.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.100
Well, I am so sorry.

06:08.166 --> 06:10.166
I never even think that way,

06:10.166 --> 06:13.400
that I'm put in your shoes.

06:16.066 --> 06:17.266
-[Gabriel] But, cheers.
-Cheers.

06:17.266 --> 06:18.300
-I love you.
-I love you, dude.

06:18.367 --> 06:19.700
-[kisses]
-I love you.

06:22.900 --> 06:23.967
[Shannan] Bye.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.000
<i>Vamonos!</i>

06:25.000 --> 06:26.200
All right, we know.
Just kidding.

06:26.266 --> 06:27.467
<i>Adios.</i>

[all cheering]

06:38.266 --> 06:40.300
I choose Pola.

06:40.367 --> 06:41.967

<i>and I get alone time</i>
<i>with Stefany.</i>

06:49.367 --> 06:50.667
I've never been
on a double date

06:50.667 --> 06:51.567
with my mom before.

06:51.567 --> 06:53.000
[laughs]

06:53.000 --> 06:56.266
-It definitely doesn't seem
like my mom's vibe.
-I'm with Joey.

06:56.266 --> 06:57.467
He's 20.

06:57.467 --> 07:00.000
And he's such a gentleman,
which I really like in a man.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.567
And he's such a gentleman,
which I really like in a man.

07:03.200 --> 07:06.266
[festive
Mexican music playing]

07:08.467 --> 07:10.967
Whoo-hoo!

07:15.300 --> 07:17.767
[Joey] <i>I picked April</i>
<i>because I love her vibe.</i>

07:17.767 --> 07:20.000
<i>I love her energy.</i>

07:20.066 --> 07:22.967
Not only does April have

07:22.967 --> 07:25.266
<i>a beautiful face,</i>
<i>beautiful body,</i>

07:25.266 --> 07:26.700
<i>she has a great personality,</i>

07:26.767 --> 07:28.700
but she's also very wise.

07:28.767 --> 07:30.000
<i>She could teach me</i>
<i>many things.</i>

07:30.000 --> 07:30.767
<i>She could teach me</i>
<i>many things.</i>

07:30.767 --> 07:32.066
<i>It's very attractive</i>

07:32.066 --> 07:34.500
that she has
a lot of life experience.

07:34.567 --> 07:35.433
[chuckles]

07:35.467 --> 07:37.567
Welcome
to La Miserable Mezcaleria.

07:37.567 --> 07:38.500
Take a seat.

07:38.567 --> 07:39.900
<i>Vamos.</i>

07:39.967 --> 07:42.667
Stefany caught my eye
because she just seems

07:42.667 --> 07:45.667
so sweet, and I think
she's super pretty.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.700
<i>She seems like</i>
<i>a well put together gal,</i>

07:47.767 --> 07:49.867
so I could definitely,

07:49.867 --> 07:51.367
you know,
be interested in that.

07:51.367 --> 07:52.600
Thank you.

07:52.667 --> 07:56.367
I picked Pola because
she's very nice on the eyes,

07:56.367 --> 07:57.867
personality-wise,
very warm,

07:57.867 --> 07:59.467
<i>very inviting,</i>
<i>very exciting.</i>

07:59.467 --> 08:00.000
Banging body, too.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.867
Banging body, too.

08:01.867 --> 08:02.767
[waiter] I will explain to you

08:02.767 --> 08:04.667
a little bit
about mescal today.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.400
What you have today
are three different mescals

08:06.467 --> 08:08.266
from three different parts
of Mexico.

08:08.266 --> 08:10.100
You have also
a little bit of crickets.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.800
Yes, crickets,
edible crickets.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.033
-You can peel it...
-[gags]

08:13.033 --> 08:15.000
[waiter] ...and eat it,
that is, removing the legs...

08:15.066 --> 08:16.300
-[Pola] Ugh!
-[waiter] ...or you can
eat it whole.

08:16.367 --> 08:18.600
[Joey] <i>It was actually</i>
<i>the very first time</i>

08:18.667 --> 08:20.100
<i>I've seen crickets</i>

08:20.100 --> 08:21.867
on a dinner table like that.
[chuckles]

08:23.300 --> 08:25.967
If I'm gonna try them
with anyone, it'll be April J.

08:27.367 --> 08:30.000
-How do you like them?
-I didn't realize
that they were so, like,

08:30.066 --> 08:31.300
-crickety.
-[Joey laughing]
Totally, yeah!

08:31.367 --> 08:32.567
They're so crickety.

08:32.567 --> 08:33.567
Ahhh!

08:33.567 --> 08:35.700
-[both laugh]
-God!

08:36.767 --> 08:38.100
Come on, you have to.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.567
[Pola]

08:40.567 --> 08:43.667
I really enjoy that Ryan
is more secure about himself,

08:43.667 --> 08:45.800
<i>and I knew he was more mature.</i>

08:45.867 --> 08:48.166
It's good that he asked me out
on this date.

08:48.166 --> 08:50.467
-[laughs]
-It's disgusting!

08:51.166 --> 08:52.667
<i>Salud</i> , everyone.

08:52.667 --> 08:53.700
<i>Salud.</i>

08:55.000 --> 08:57.467
-[Stefany chuckling]
Oh, no, no!
-[spits]

08:58.600 --> 09:00.000
[Stefany] What happened?

09:00.000 --> 09:00.200
[Stefany] What happened?

09:02.266 --> 09:03.567
[Gabriel] Open your mouth,
close your eyes.

09:04.900 --> 09:06.567
Ahhh! [chuckles]

09:06.567 --> 09:09.500
Gabriel's throwing crickets,
and, you know,

09:09.567 --> 09:10.567
getting grossed out,

09:10.567 --> 09:12.200
and kind of being immature
about the situation.

09:12.266 --> 09:15.266
<i>It comes off</i>
<i>a bit disrespectful</i>
<i>to act that way.</i>

09:15.266 --> 09:19.567
I'm not seeing
what Stefany's seeing in him.

09:19.567 --> 09:22.166
I'm not understanding
how he's gonna find

09:22.166 --> 09:25.100
an older woman that
will actually be interested

09:25.100 --> 09:28.266
in seriously dating him,
just being that childish.

09:28.266 --> 09:30.000
From what I'm seeing,
she's sitting with a man-baby.

09:30.000 --> 09:30.767
From what I'm seeing,
she's sitting with a man-baby.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.066
[Joey] Hey!

09:35.100 --> 09:37.266
That's what you get
for asking my mom on a date!

09:37.266 --> 09:39.100
-[bleeping] [laughs]
-[Joey] Hey!

09:39.100 --> 09:40.900
[Gabriel] <i>Joey's</i>
<i>a little sly guy,</i>

09:40.967 --> 09:43.567
and now, he's trying
to hit on my mom,

09:43.567 --> 09:44.867
and it's not sitting right
with me.

09:44.867 --> 09:46.100
It's not sitting pretty.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.667
[Joey] Wow.

09:47.667 --> 09:48.900
-Hey.
-[chuckling] Calm down.

09:48.900 --> 09:50.800
-You're the most intriguing
person in the house.
-Aw!

09:50.867 --> 09:52.100
I want to be with Jose.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.500
-I love my son.
-Okay.

09:53.567 --> 09:57.367
It is a bit of mama's boy
going on with Jose and Pola.

10:05.166 --> 10:06.066
[Gabriel] Have you
ever thought

10:06.066 --> 10:07.300
you could date, like,
a younger guy?

10:07.367 --> 10:09.500
Yeah. For sure.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.667
[Gabriel] What do you like
about me?

10:10.667 --> 10:14.100
Your vibe,
it's so, you know...

10:14.166 --> 10:16.367
I think it's the energy.

10:16.367 --> 10:17.700
I love your eyes.

10:17.767 --> 10:18.567
Hmm?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.000
They're cute.

10:21.066 --> 10:22.467
[Stefany] How about you?

10:22.467 --> 10:24.166
Why did you pick me
to go out on a date?

10:25.300 --> 10:28.000
I thought you were
the prettiest. Like, my type.

10:28.066 --> 10:29.300
Thank you.

10:29.300 --> 10:30.182
It would be fun to actually
get to know you a little bit.

10:30.182 --> 10:32.166
It would be fun to actually
get to know you a little bit.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.200
<i>I make music. I'm an artist.</i>

10:35.266 --> 10:38.000
I do modeling as well.
I travel a lot, so...

10:38.066 --> 10:41.600
<i>I'd say my ideal girl needs</i>
<i>to be kind of well-rounded,</i>

10:41.667 --> 10:45.166
intelligent, really just
a happy, positive person.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.667
What's your, like,
best date idea?

10:47.667 --> 10:51.000
-Best, if you had to come up
with a dream date.
-I'm really simple.

10:51.000 --> 10:55.600
I think, just like a nice,
I think, conversation,

10:55.667 --> 10:57.367
and some candles.

10:57.367 --> 10:59.767
I feel like talking to Stefany
the first five minutes,

10:59.767 --> 11:00.182
I could already tell
she's independent,

11:00.182 --> 11:01.900
I could already tell
she's independent,

11:01.967 --> 11:05.100
she's strong, so I'm
definitely interested in that.

11:05.100 --> 11:06.200
To getting to know each other.

11:06.266 --> 11:07.367
Yes.

11:07.367 --> 11:08.700
<i>-Salud.</i>
<i>-Salud.</i>

11:08.767 --> 11:10.867
[Stefany] <i>I've never dated</i>
<i>anyone like Gabriel.</i>

11:10.867 --> 11:13.500
He's stylish,
he's spontaneous,

11:13.567 --> 11:18.266
<i>He's very funny, outgoing.</i>
<i>He just says it how it is.</i>

11:18.266 --> 11:22.900
I am excited to see
what God has in store for us.

11:22.967 --> 11:25.967
-Oh, you're the best.
-[exhales]

11:25.967 --> 11:28.000
[April J] What are the effects
of these crickets?

11:28.066 --> 11:29.367
-Are there some type of...
-[Joey] Yes.

11:29.367 --> 11:30.182
-Are they aphrodisiacs, or...
-Psychedelic? [chuckles]

11:30.182 --> 11:31.367
-Are they aphrodisiacs, or...
-Psychedelic? [chuckles]

11:31.367 --> 11:34.367
-[April J] What is it?
-[Joey] I mean, I'm assuming
they bring good luck,

11:34.367 --> 11:35.567
and good love.

11:35.567 --> 11:36.500
[chuckles]

11:36.567 --> 11:38.500
[April J] Maybe.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.100
[Gabriel] <i>Joey's</i>
<i>a little sly guy,</i>

11:40.100 --> 11:42.066
<i>and now, he's trying</i>
<i>to hit on my mom,</i>

11:42.800 --> 11:44.166
and it's not sitting right
with me.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.367
It's not sitting pretty.

11:45.367 --> 11:48.100
I would have never thought
that I would be here

11:48.100 --> 11:50.000
with such a beautiful woman.

11:50.066 --> 11:52.867
I think I'm
the oldest mom in the house,

11:52.867 --> 11:56.667
and Joey is
the youngest man in the house,

11:56.667 --> 11:57.900
<i>but Joey's so sweet,</i>

11:57.967 --> 12:00.182
<i>and complimentary,</i>
<i>and sensitive.</i>

12:00.182 --> 12:00.767
<i>and complimentary,</i>
<i>and sensitive.</i>

12:00.767 --> 12:03.166
He's actually acting
more like a man

12:03.166 --> 12:05.667
than most men twice his age.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.400
Just because, you know,

12:07.467 --> 12:10.100
my license says this,
and your license says that...

12:10.166 --> 12:11.100
[Joey] Mmm-hmm.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.000
I'm sure you have
a license, right?

12:13.000 --> 12:14.266
[both laugh]

12:14.266 --> 12:15.100
[Gabriel] Mom!

12:16.066 --> 12:17.667
How's your date going?
[chuckles]

12:18.467 --> 12:19.700
Oh, it's going great.

12:20.266 --> 12:21.900
Don't get her too wasted.

12:21.967 --> 12:24.567
-I'm trying to have
my date. "Mom!"
-[laughs]

12:24.567 --> 12:25.800
-[Gabriel] Mom,
it's about my date.
-"Mom!"

12:25.867 --> 12:27.467
-[Gabriel] it's
about our date, okay?
-"Mom!"

12:27.467 --> 12:28.667
[Joey] "Mom!" "Mom!"

12:28.700 --> 12:30.182
<i>I'm not intimidated at all</i>
<i>by having Gabriel around.</i>

12:30.182 --> 12:31.166
<i>I'm not intimidated at all</i>
<i>by having Gabriel around.</i>

12:31.166 --> 12:34.667
Well, I think Gabriel's
honestly annoyed with me.

12:34.667 --> 12:37.266
<i>He doesn't like whatever</i>
<i>is going on at my table.</i>

12:37.266 --> 12:38.800
<i>That boy better watch out.</i>

12:38.867 --> 12:40.467
I'm gonna be his papa one day.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.567
Hey!

12:42.567 --> 12:44.100
-That's what you get
for asking my mom on a date!
-[Joey] Hey!

12:44.166 --> 12:45.166
[bleeping]

12:45.166 --> 12:46.400
-[bleeping] [laughs]
-[Joey] Hey!

12:46.467 --> 12:48.900
-[Stefany chuckling]
Calm down.
-[Ryan] <i>Wow.</i>

12:48.967 --> 12:51.667
<i>I'm tired of watching</i>
<i>Gabriel be corny.</i>

12:51.667 --> 12:54.266
You know? I just want to
kind of be in my own vibes,

12:54.266 --> 12:56.200
right now, with Pola,
and just really, you know,

12:56.266 --> 12:58.166
<i>experience this date</i>
<i>for what it can be,</i>

12:58.166 --> 12:59.700
so I was,
"It's time to take a walk."

12:59.767 --> 13:00.182
-All right,
let's walk, and talk.
-Let's go.

13:00.182 --> 13:01.867
-All right,
let's walk, and talk.
-Let's go.

13:01.867 --> 13:04.200
Thanks. You don't want
to take the empanada?

13:04.266 --> 13:05.467
-I'm all set.
-[laughs]

13:05.467 --> 13:07.667
[Ryan] <i>Obviously,</i>
<i>I think Pola's attractive.</i>

13:07.667 --> 13:11.367
I think her energy
is much younger than her age.

13:11.367 --> 13:12.266
[Pola] <i>Vamos.</i>

13:12.266 --> 13:13.600
-[Ryan] Okay.
-[chuckles]

13:14.767 --> 13:16.700
[in Spanish]

13:16.767 --> 13:20.367
That is the reason why I want
to get to know Pola better.

13:20.367 --> 13:22.166
I'm not gonna have crickets.

13:22.166 --> 13:25.800
I'm never gonna do that.
Never, ever. Never.

13:25.867 --> 13:28.867
-Well, you missed out.
It was so much fun.
-It's fine. It's fine.

13:28.867 --> 13:29.767
It's okay with me.

13:29.767 --> 13:30.182
So now, anyways,
on a serious note,

13:30.182 --> 13:31.667
So now, anyways,
on a serious note,

13:31.667 --> 13:32.900
I brought you out tonight

13:32.967 --> 13:34.567
because to me, personally,

13:34.567 --> 13:36.567
-you're the most intriguing
person in the house.
-Aw!

13:36.567 --> 13:38.800
[Ryan] You have
a lot of confidence,

13:38.867 --> 13:41.000
I think
you're absolutely gorgeous,

13:41.000 --> 13:42.367
and I think, most importantly,

13:42.367 --> 13:44.567
internally
you're a great person,

13:44.567 --> 13:46.500
-and that's extremely
attractive to me.
-Thank you.

13:48.700 --> 13:52.867
When he looks at me, like,
he feels really confident,

13:52.867 --> 13:54.367
and that becomes really sexy.

13:54.867 --> 13:55.800
So, in your eyes,

13:55.867 --> 13:57.266
what's your purpose
at the house?

13:58.567 --> 13:59.400
Right now?

14:00.800 --> 14:03.266
I really want
to enjoy my company.

14:03.266 --> 14:04.166
[Ryan] Okay.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.000
I really love myself.

14:06.467 --> 14:07.300
[Ryan] Okay.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.467
So, I want to be
with myself first,

14:10.467 --> 14:12.200
than being
with anybody else.

14:12.266 --> 14:13.567
[Ryan] Okay.

14:13.567 --> 14:16.467
Then, I want to be
with Jose.

14:16.467 --> 14:18.000
-I love my son.
-Okay.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.967
Jose is my guy, but it is...

14:19.967 --> 14:23.667
It is a bit of mama's boy
going on with Jose and Pola.

14:23.667 --> 14:26.300
[Pola] And then,
I'm really open to anything.

14:26.367 --> 14:27.867
So, let me ask you this.
So far...

14:27.867 --> 14:30.100
-Yeah.
-...out of all
of your dates, so far...

14:30.100 --> 14:30.182
This has been really good.

14:30.182 --> 14:31.767
This has been really good.

14:31.767 --> 14:32.967
-This has been good?
-I like mescal, yes.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.567
-Don't give me
the friend hand on the date.
-[laughs]

14:34.567 --> 14:36.100
Don't you Jimmy me.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.300
<i>Pola, to me,</i>
<i>has the most question marks.</i>

14:40.100 --> 14:41.100
<i>Is she here to date?</i>

14:41.166 --> 14:43.567
You know,
'cause I am here to date,

14:43.567 --> 14:45.767
and you really have to be
on the same page

14:45.767 --> 14:47.767
with somebody to see

14:47.767 --> 14:49.000
if you can
further progress with them.

14:50.867 --> 14:52.767
[kissing]

14:56.367 --> 14:57.567
[kisses]

14:57.567 --> 14:59.000
[Ryan] <i>If Pola is gonna</i>
<i>continue to be guarded,</i>

14:59.066 --> 15:00.182
obviously I gotta
keep it moving.

15:00.182 --> 15:00.467
obviously I gotta
keep it moving.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.767
Um, it's like the McRib
at McDonald's, you know?

15:02.767 --> 15:04.567
Like, "limited time only,"
you know? [laughs]

15:05.567 --> 15:07.200
-All right, come on.
-That was great.

15:15.667 --> 15:16.867
-[guys laughing]
- <i>Salud.</i>

15:16.867 --> 15:18.266
<i>Salud.</i>

15:24.166 --> 15:25.867
[Gabriel] <i>"Salud,</i>
<i>salud, salud!"</i>

15:25.867 --> 15:27.567
-[Jose] That's my mama.
-[Gabriel laughs]

15:29.567 --> 15:30.182
So, are you loving it here?

15:30.182 --> 15:31.100
So, are you loving it here?

15:31.166 --> 15:33.000
Yeah. I'm super excited.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.367
I'm a very open-minded person.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.500
-[Kelle] Yeah.
-Very relaxed.

15:36.567 --> 15:38.400
"Go with the flow"
type of person.

15:39.367 --> 15:40.667
[Kelle] I'm open
to anything, too.

15:41.667 --> 15:42.567
We have to be.

15:43.467 --> 15:44.867
Even though
everything was great

15:44.867 --> 15:47.667
going to Mushroom Rock
with Jose on our first date,

15:47.667 --> 15:49.367
after the blowup,
now I feel like

15:49.367 --> 15:51.467
he's avoiding me
like the plague, so...

15:51.467 --> 15:54.200
<i>I think that Jose</i>
<i>is definitely a mama's boy,</i>
<i>for sure.</i>

15:54.266 --> 15:56.567
I mean, if he's not going
to make an effort,

15:56.567 --> 15:57.767
<i>and he's just gonna let me go,</i>

15:57.767 --> 15:59.266
<i>then I'm gonna</i>
<i>keep moving forward,</i>

15:59.266 --> 16:00.182
so that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

16:00.182 --> 16:01.667
so that's exactly
what I'm gonna do.

16:01.667 --> 16:04.467
So, now I'm gonna see
what Billy's got going on.

16:04.467 --> 16:06.367
Have you dated younger before?

16:06.367 --> 16:07.867
Yeah.

16:07.867 --> 16:10.567
Do you prefer younger,
or older, around your age?

16:10.567 --> 16:11.567
[Kelle chuckles]

16:11.567 --> 16:13.967
I feel like younger guys
are a lot more open,

16:13.967 --> 16:18.667
and they don't have a lot of,
um, constraints, I think,

16:18.667 --> 16:19.567
on their thought process.

16:19.567 --> 16:21.000
They don't, like,
overthink things

16:21.066 --> 16:22.567
because of stuff that happened
to them in the past.

16:22.567 --> 16:24.700
-They're just more free
with, like...
-[Billy] Yeah.

16:24.767 --> 16:26.667
...who they are,
and I feel like a lot of times

16:26.667 --> 16:29.900
they have more direction
on where they want to go.

16:30.467 --> 16:31.500
What about you?

16:31.567 --> 16:32.500
Um...

16:34.700 --> 16:37.867
I don't really see
too much of an age thing.

16:37.867 --> 16:40.367
Age isn't really
a problem for me.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.900
Just like you,
connection is very important,

16:42.967 --> 16:44.500
the right chemistry.

16:44.567 --> 16:46.900
[Kelle] <i>The one thing</i>
<i>that I really love,</i>

16:46.967 --> 16:49.500
that's a big turn-on for me,
is a guy that puts in effort,

16:49.567 --> 16:51.567
and that actually shows
interest in me,

16:51.567 --> 16:53.367
so the fact
that Billy's actually showing

16:53.367 --> 16:56.100
interest in me, I'm kind of
open to exploring,

16:56.100 --> 16:57.500
you know, to see
if there's anything there.

17:01.967 --> 17:03.467
-[Ryan] What's that?
The pinot?
-You want one?

17:03.467 --> 17:05.266
Where's mine?

17:05.266 --> 17:06.767
[Ryan] It's coming.

17:06.767 --> 17:08.100
-[chuckles]
-[Ryan] I'm
about to bring it over.

17:08.100 --> 17:10.467
-Thank you.
-You're killing yourself
that way, for them.

17:11.000 --> 17:11.900
Oh!

17:11.967 --> 17:13.000
[Stefany] Thank you.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.667
-[Ryan] Absolutely.
-[Stefany] You're so nice.

17:14.667 --> 17:16.166
[Ryan] I try to be.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.467
-Cheers.
-[Ryan] Cheers.

17:17.467 --> 17:19.767
<i>I feel like the date with Pola</i>
<i>goes pretty well,</i>

17:19.767 --> 17:22.900
<i>but I am here to date,</i>
<i>so I'm kind of shifting,</i>

17:22.967 --> 17:25.166
you know, my interest
at this point toward Stefany.

17:25.166 --> 17:26.867
Hopefully, I can show her
something different

17:26.867 --> 17:29.467
than she was experiencing
at the table with Gabriel.

17:29.467 --> 17:30.182
Do you date women with kids?

17:30.182 --> 17:31.100
Do you date women with kids?

17:31.166 --> 17:32.800
At my age,
I'm used to it now,

17:32.867 --> 17:35.100
but like, it's kind of, like,
the inconvenience

17:35.166 --> 17:38.967
-of trying to plan with you,
and spend time with you.
-[Stefany] Yeah.

17:38.967 --> 17:41.266
If I really like you,
I'm gonna make the time.

17:41.266 --> 17:43.767
[Ryan] <i>I think Stefany</i>
<i>is just naturally sexy,</i>

17:43.767 --> 17:45.667
<i>and extremely</i>
<i>well put together.</i>

17:45.667 --> 17:47.567
<i>She's definitely</i>
<i>an eye talker,</i>

17:47.567 --> 17:49.567
<i>and that gets me every time.</i>

17:49.567 --> 17:51.266
Even though Stefany is older,

17:51.266 --> 17:54.000
she kind of has, like,
a young appeal.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.667
<i>She's obviously</i>
<i>an attractive woman.</i>

17:56.667 --> 17:58.567
Do you do online dating?

17:58.567 --> 18:00.182
I've done it before.

18:00.182 --> 18:00.200
I've done it before.

18:00.266 --> 18:02.300
Do you do FaceTime
before you meet them?

18:02.367 --> 18:03.200
-[Ryan] Uh...
-Ah!

18:03.266 --> 18:04.533
I learned my lesson with that

18:04.533 --> 18:05.734
-a couple times before, so...
[chuckles]
-[Stefany] Yes!

18:05.734 --> 18:08.166
I FaceTime like, all right,
you swiped? Let's FaceTime.

18:08.166 --> 18:10.200
-Like, yeah, let me see you.
-[Stefany chuckling] Right.

18:10.266 --> 18:13.367
Ryan is 30,
and actually, it works for me,

18:13.367 --> 18:15.800
because our communication
seemed to be

18:15.867 --> 18:16.867
on the same level,

18:16.867 --> 18:19.300
because he's the one
that's closest to my age,

18:19.367 --> 18:21.700
<i>and I felt</i>
<i>chemistry with Ryan.</i>

18:25.100 --> 18:26.867
[Gabriel] <i>I don't know Ryan,</i>
<i>but I feel like</i>

18:26.867 --> 18:29.266

or two days,

18:29.266 --> 18:30.182

more than one girl,

18:30.182 --> 18:32.367
you know, he's hitting on
more than one girl,

18:32.367 --> 18:34.000
so I feel like that might show

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
that, okay, yeah,
he's a little player type.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.033
<i>I'm someone who...</i>

18:38.033 --> 18:39.567
<i>I don't really</i>
<i>get jealous that easily,</i>

18:39.567 --> 18:42.066
but I feel like Stefany and I
have something going,

18:42.066 --> 18:46.000
<i>so I feel like he kind of</i>
<i>needs to uh, you know,</i>

18:46.767 --> 18:48.367

outside of the norm.

19:38.166 --> 19:41.700
I'm a very good kisser,

19:41.767 --> 19:45.200
but I need someone to tell me

19:45.266 --> 19:48.767
-if that is true or not.
-[laughing] Oh, my God!

19:48.767 --> 19:51.100

-Yes.

-Okay.

19:56.100 --> 19:57.166
You're not supposed to ask.

The secret really
kind of, like,

32:19.066 --> 32:20.767
<i>I'm like,</i>
<i>"What am I doing right now</i>

32:20.767 --> 32:21.967
at the club with my mom?"

32:22.767 --> 32:24.667
Wow. That was fun.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.166
-Yeah.
-[Stefany] Was it awkward

32:26.166 --> 32:27.767
-a little bit,
'cause your mom's there?
-Now awkward.

32:27.767 --> 32:29.000
It was just, like,

32:29.066 --> 32:32.066
she's over there
with a...[chuckles]

32:32.066 --> 32:34.900
-[laughs]
-...with some, you know,
somebody young.

32:34.967 --> 32:37.567
Who do you think
you like most in the house?

32:37.567 --> 32:39.266
In the house
that I vibe with?

32:39.266 --> 32:41.166
Yeah, that you, like,
really vibe with.

32:41.166 --> 32:42.500
It's crazy,
'cause I really like

32:42.567 --> 32:43.900
-Soyoung's personality a lot.
-Yeah.

32:43.967 --> 32:44.638
I just think
she's really cool.

32:44.638 --> 32:45.600
I just think
she's really cool.

32:49.867 --> 32:51.767
Who are you
the most attracted to?

32:51.767 --> 32:53.100
That would be Pola.

32:55.200 --> 32:57.367
[Stefany] <i>I thought</i>
<i>he was gonna say, "Oh, you."</i>

32:57.367 --> 32:59.667
But no, he actually named
other ladies.

32:59.667 --> 33:02.300
<i>Okay, then why am I</i>
<i>the one here with you?</i>

33:02.367 --> 33:04.667
<i>If he had a connection</i>
<i>with someone else,</i>

33:04.667 --> 33:07.000
he should have gone with them,

33:07.000 --> 33:08.867
and not brought me
on this date.

33:08.867 --> 33:10.600
They seem to be
doing amazing.

33:10.667 --> 33:13.266
Thank you for bringing me
out on this date.

33:13.266 --> 33:14.638
-You did great
on the dance floor, so...
-Thank you, thank you.

33:14.638 --> 33:15.567
-You did great
on the dance floor, so...
-Thank you, thank you.

33:15.567 --> 33:18.500
-[Charlene] I'm so used to
leading all the time, that--
-You are?

33:18.567 --> 33:20.400
-Why?
-Yeah, because
I'm independent.

33:20.467 --> 33:21.900
I have to do
everything for myself.

33:21.967 --> 33:24.500
I don't really,
you know...

33:24.567 --> 33:26.166
Who would I be following?

33:26.166 --> 33:28.000
But no, but in dating, like,

33:28.000 --> 33:29.667
people that
you've dated before,

33:29.667 --> 33:32.300
you usually lead
the conversations, and the...

33:32.367 --> 33:33.900
-[Charlene] Um...
-Or it's mixed?

33:33.967 --> 33:36.166
No. I feel like
if I were to do that,

33:36.166 --> 33:38.767
that I would lose interest.

33:38.767 --> 33:39.667
[Jose] Why?

33:39.667 --> 33:40.667
I don't know. I kind of...

33:40.667 --> 33:42.400
Maybe I'm old-fashioned
in that way...

33:42.467 --> 33:44.300
-Okay.
-...where, in my life,

33:44.367 --> 33:44.638
being single,
and a single mom,

33:44.638 --> 33:46.066
being single,
and a single mom,

33:46.066 --> 33:47.433
and independent...

33:47.433 --> 33:50.467
-Yeah.
-...I always had to take care
of things, and business,

33:50.467 --> 33:54.567
so it's like, when you're
always wearing the pants,

33:54.567 --> 33:58.400
-or always having to, like,
take the bull by the horns...
-Yeah.

33:58.467 --> 34:00.667
...I'd like to think
that it's nice

34:00.667 --> 34:03.467
to be able to just, like,
let my hair down, and relax...

34:03.467 --> 34:06.500
-Mmm.
-...and feel like someone can
just lead the conversation.

34:07.500 --> 34:09.400
I am tired
of being independent

34:09.467 --> 34:12.200
in that sense of like, listen,
it's time for me to be able

34:12.266 --> 34:14.467
to, like, sit back and relax.

34:14.467 --> 34:14.638
<i>I've had to be</i>
<i>the front-runner</i>

34:14.638 --> 34:16.500
<i>I've had to be</i>
<i>the front-runner</i>

34:16.567 --> 34:21.367
for a long time now, so yeah,
I'm ready to let somebody else

34:21.367 --> 34:23.500
take the wheel
for a little while.

34:23.567 --> 34:25.800
Um, I see it
completely differently,

34:25.867 --> 34:27.100
in dating, especially.

34:27.667 --> 34:29.300
I see both as equals...

34:29.367 --> 34:32.200
-Right.
-...so part has
its own liberty, and...

34:32.266 --> 34:33.867
-I mean, I get that.
-You know what I mean?

34:33.867 --> 34:36.467
-And don't drive.
-But a woman needs to feel
a certain way.

34:36.467 --> 34:39.100
If you say to me,
"Would you like to go out?"

34:39.100 --> 34:40.667
that lets me know
you're interested.

34:40.667 --> 34:44.638
-It's not that I would expect
a woman to approach at all.
-Right, right.

34:44.638 --> 34:45.066
-It's not that I would expect
a woman to approach at all.
-Right, right.

34:45.066 --> 34:47.700
-It's that if she does...
-Yeah.

34:47.767 --> 34:49.900
...I'll be surprised,
and I would say, like,

34:49.967 --> 34:51.600
-"Okay," like, "That's cool."
-Yeah.

34:51.667 --> 34:56.100
I think Jose was starting
to understand my perspective,

34:56.166 --> 34:58.066
but at the same time,
part of me thinks

34:58.066 --> 35:00.166
that deep down, it's not
that important to him.

35:00.166 --> 35:03.967
Like, I don't think he really
gets where I'm coming from,

35:03.967 --> 35:06.667
and what that means
from a woman.

35:06.667 --> 35:08.667
Romantically, as a woman...

35:08.667 --> 35:10.567
-[Jose] Uh-huh.
-...I want to feel desired.

35:10.567 --> 35:11.967
[Jose] <i>We had a lot of fun,</i>
<i>but I think</i>

35:11.967 --> 35:14.638
that romantic chemistry
is not quite there.

35:14.638 --> 35:15.100
that romantic chemistry
is not quite there.

35:15.100 --> 35:16.400
- <i>Salud?</i>
-[Charlene] All right.

35:16.467 --> 35:18.066
-Before we go, let's <i>salud.</i>
-[Charlene] Yes.

35:18.066 --> 35:19.200
-[Jose] <i>Gracias.</i>
-One for the road.

35:19.266 --> 35:20.200
-[chuckles]
-[Jose] Yes.

35:31.266 --> 35:33.066
Would you have gone,
like, Latin dancing,

35:33.066 --> 35:34.767
-or is that not your vibe?
-I would have went.

35:34.767 --> 35:36.100
-Hell yeah.
-Yeah? Would you
have had fun?

35:36.166 --> 35:37.767
-I would go. Yeah.
-That's an answer.

35:37.767 --> 35:40.367
-That seems like
a cute date, huh?
-It's fun.

35:40.367 --> 35:43.400
So, I feel like
Stefany's been going on dates,

35:43.467 --> 35:44.638
<i>and like, she's allowed to do</i>
<i>whatever she wants,</i>

35:44.638 --> 35:46.100
<i>and like, she's allowed to do</i>
<i>whatever she wants,</i>

35:46.166 --> 35:49.066
but then again,
I was kind of bummed,

35:49.066 --> 35:50.467
<i>just because for me,</i>

35:50.467 --> 35:52.000
personally,
I don't really have my eye

35:52.066 --> 35:52.867
on anyone else.

35:53.700 --> 35:54.967
Want some beer, maybe?

35:55.867 --> 35:58.867
-What's happening?
-So, you went on a date
with Harrison.

35:59.567 --> 36:01.000
-Yeah.
-[Charlene chuckles]

36:01.066 --> 36:02.667
[Charlene] What's that mean
for you guys, yeah?

36:02.667 --> 36:05.667
-Kind of wanted
to talk to you about it.
-[Charlene and Pola chuckle]

36:05.667 --> 36:08.166
[Ryan] <i>Gabriel's just doing</i>
<i>a little too much for me.</i>

36:08.166 --> 36:09.367
<i>We didn't come in here</i>

36:09.367 --> 36:11.500
<i>with ties already.</i>
<i>This is new energy.</i>

36:11.567 --> 36:13.367
<i>We're getting to know</i>
<i>new people.</i>

36:13.367 --> 36:14.638
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>what pair fits.</i>

36:14.638 --> 36:15.000
<i>You don't know</i>
<i>what pair fits.</i>

36:15.066 --> 36:16.667
He's a smooth guy, huh?

36:16.667 --> 36:17.867
Oh, my gosh.

36:17.867 --> 36:19.767
[Ryan] <i>I feel like</i>
<i>Gabriel lacks respect,</i>

36:19.767 --> 36:22.300
<i>because every time</i>
<i>it's somebody else's turn</i>

36:22.367 --> 36:23.600
<i>to get to know someone,</i>

36:23.667 --> 36:25.467
<i>it's not your time</i>
<i>to infringe.</i>

36:25.467 --> 36:27.166
[both chuckle]

36:28.166 --> 36:29.166
[Ryan] <i>I don't think</i>
<i>he knows what</i>

36:29.166 --> 36:31.467
<i>he wants to do with Stefany,</i>

36:31.467 --> 36:33.500
<i>but I think</i>
<i>Gabriel likes attention,</i>

36:33.567 --> 36:36.166
and I think that
anything without him,

36:36.166 --> 36:37.467
I think he wants to be in it.

36:38.200 --> 36:39.467
[imitates slide whistle]

36:39.467 --> 36:40.367
[chuckles]

36:40.367 --> 36:41.667
[all laughing]

36:42.767 --> 36:44.638
[Stefany in Spanish]

36:44.638 --> 36:44.867
[Stefany in Spanish]

36:50.100 --> 36:51.667
-Who, you and I?
-Yeah.

36:51.667 --> 36:53.166
I do like Gabriel a lot,

36:53.166 --> 36:56.000
<i>but I'm a little confused,</i>
<i>at this point.</i>

36:56.066 --> 36:58.100
[Gabriel] <i>I do not feel</i>
<i>threatened by Ryan,</i>

36:58.100 --> 37:00.367
because no one really has
a chance in here.

37:00.367 --> 37:01.367
I think it's in the bag.

37:01.367 --> 37:03.100
How do you feel about Gabriel?

37:03.767 --> 37:05.000
More friends.

37:06.100 --> 37:09.100
I think that she's interested
in me, 100%.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.567
-[all exclaiming]
-[all laughing]

37:22.700 --> 37:24.600
The conversations
that I've had

37:24.667 --> 37:26.500
with Stefany so far,

37:26.567 --> 37:28.467
I feel like I've peeled back
some layers with her.

37:28.467 --> 37:29.867
<i>I've gotten to know</i>
<i>her better,</i>

37:29.867 --> 37:32.166
<i>but we haven't even been</i>
<i>on a date yet,</i>

37:32.166 --> 37:34.000
<i>so I think this is</i>
<i>the perfect opportunity,</i>

37:34.066 --> 37:35.867
<i>because it is</i>
<i>extremely important</i>

37:35.867 --> 37:37.066
for me to peel back layers.

37:37.066 --> 37:39.600
With anybody
that I'm involved with,

37:39.667 --> 37:42.021
<i>I like to know</i>
<i>what I'm dealing with</i>

37:42.021 --> 37:42.800
<i>I like to know</i>
<i>what I'm dealing with</i>

37:42.867 --> 37:44.266
before I get into it.

37:44.266 --> 37:46.166
I would like to know
what I'm signing up for.

37:46.166 --> 37:48.166
You got to read a contract
before you sign it.

37:50.100 --> 37:51.600
-Who, you and I?
-Yeah.

37:51.667 --> 37:53.000
-Okay, so...
-Come.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.100
Oops.

37:54.100 --> 37:55.066
[Stefany]

37:55.100 --> 37:57.266
-"Come on," you know.
-[Stefany chuckles]

37:57.266 --> 37:58.800
[Stefany] <i>I do like</i>
<i>Gabriel a lot,</i>

37:58.867 --> 38:01.400
<i>but I'm a little confused,</i>
<i>at this point,</i>

38:01.467 --> 38:04.800
because I jibe with Ryan.
He's a cool dude.

38:04.867 --> 38:07.166
Why wouldn't I want to go
snorkeling with him?

38:07.166 --> 38:08.367
[chuckling] Let's go.

38:08.367 --> 38:09.600
Bye!

38:09.667 --> 38:12.000
Ohhh!

38:12.066 --> 38:14.166
[Gabriel] <i>I do not feel</i>
<i>threatened by Ryan,</i>

38:14.166 --> 38:17.467
<i>because me and Stefany</i>
<i>were definitely killing it.</i>

38:17.467 --> 38:18.767
<i>We like each other.</i>

38:18.767 --> 38:21.266
I definitely think no one
really has a chance in here.

38:21.266 --> 38:22.467
I think it's in the bag.

38:26.367 --> 38:30.266
[Stefany] I haven't gone
snorkeling in, like, so long.

38:30.266 --> 38:31.667
[Ryan] <i>I'm excited</i>
<i>to go snorkeling,</i>

38:31.667 --> 38:33.100
<i>because</i>
<i>the water's magnificent.</i>

38:33.100 --> 38:34.400
<i>Like, the water's</i>
<i>beautiful here,</i>

38:34.467 --> 38:36.400
<i>and it's even more exciting</i>
<i>to do it with a person</i>

38:36.467 --> 38:38.567
<i>that you're interested in,</i>
<i>that's looking good.</i>

38:41.867 --> 38:42.021
No.

38:42.021 --> 38:42.934
No.

38:43.667 --> 38:46.000
[Stefany] <i>Ryan's definitely</i>
<i>looking out.</i>

38:46.066 --> 38:48.100
<i>He's teaching me</i>
<i>how to snorkel.</i>

38:48.100 --> 38:51.400
<i>I'm following his lead.</i>
<i>He makes me feel comfortable.</i>

38:51.467 --> 38:53.000
Just going with the flow.

38:53.066 --> 38:55.200
<i>So, he goes in for the kiss,</i>

38:55.266 --> 38:57.500
and it was just so sweet.

38:59.867 --> 39:00.767
[chuckles]

39:01.567 --> 39:02.567
[kisses]

39:03.567 --> 39:04.634
[Stefany] This is so...

39:04.634 --> 39:06.066
[Ryan] <i>Stefany's</i>
<i>a pretty good kisser.</i>

39:06.066 --> 39:07.567
<i>It's not an awkward kiss.</i>

39:07.567 --> 39:09.000
<i>This kiss is meant to happen.</i>

39:09.066 --> 39:12.021
These lips and these lips work
when they come together.

39:12.021 --> 39:13.066
These lips and these lips work
when they come together.

39:14.100 --> 39:16.667
Here's to great friendships,
and good times.

39:16.667 --> 39:18.000
Good times.

39:18.000 --> 39:18.867
[Stefany] Cheers.

39:22.367 --> 39:24.100
So, are you enjoying yourself?

39:24.500 --> 39:25.367
[Ryan] I am.

39:25.367 --> 39:26.400
Like, I feel like
the first couple

39:26.467 --> 39:28.867
of conversations we had
were like, very open.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.800
I appreciate in general
how your conversation is,

39:31.867 --> 39:32.867
and then, how

39:34.400 --> 39:35.800
genuine you are.

39:35.867 --> 39:37.367
Thanks for acknowledging that.

39:38.867 --> 39:40.467
How do you feel
about the moms?

39:40.467 --> 39:42.000
Well, you know,
there's a couple people

39:42.000 --> 39:42.021
that I've had my eye on.

39:42.021 --> 39:43.166
that I've had my eye on.

39:43.166 --> 39:44.300
I was open with you.

39:44.367 --> 39:45.567
You were one of those people.

39:46.100 --> 39:47.367
I just felt like

39:48.500 --> 39:52.066
it was a lot to

39:52.066 --> 39:54.166
get some time with you,

39:54.166 --> 39:55.867
-you know, like,
just because...
-Oh, because I was always

39:56.567 --> 39:57.667
with Gabriel, you mean?

39:57.667 --> 40:00.166
I mean, yeah, like,
how do feel about Gabriel now?

40:00.166 --> 40:01.200
Honestly?

40:01.266 --> 40:02.367
He's funny,

40:03.367 --> 40:04.867
but I think...
I don't know.

40:05.867 --> 40:09.000
We've hung out,
we've gone out on a date,

40:09.000 --> 40:12.021
but it's just been fun,
like, more friends, I think.

40:12.021 --> 40:12.100
but it's just been fun,
like, more friends, I think.

40:14.266 --> 40:16.066
I haven't...
I mean, he didn't...

40:16.066 --> 40:18.166
He hasn't tried
to kiss me, or anything.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.800
<i>I think because Gabriel</i>
<i>makes me feel comfortable,</i>

40:20.867 --> 40:25.300
maybe it comes off that I'm
only, you know, open to him.

40:25.367 --> 40:28.867
I think I like you the most,
because you're older.

40:28.867 --> 40:30.467
-The older son.
-Right.

40:30.467 --> 40:31.467
Yeah.

40:31.467 --> 40:34.500
I feel like the other sons
are more like

40:34.567 --> 40:36.300
-"friends" friends, I think.
-Mmm-hmm.

40:36.367 --> 40:38.300
If that's the case, then...

40:38.367 --> 40:39.867
-[Stefany] Mmm-hmm.
-...based on this date
and wherever it goes,

40:39.867 --> 40:42.021
-since I'm the first person
you kissed in the house...
-[Stefany] I know.

40:42.021 --> 40:42.100
-since I'm the first person
you kissed in the house...
-[Stefany] I know.

40:42.166 --> 40:43.600
...rough question for you.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.467
[sighs]

40:46.467 --> 40:47.900
What do you think?

40:47.967 --> 40:49.400
You know, I like
hanging out with you,

40:49.467 --> 40:50.967
and I think
we've had a connection,

40:50.967 --> 40:52.700
but we haven't had
enough time to spend

40:52.767 --> 40:54.367
-time together.
-Yeah.

40:54.367 --> 40:56.000
This was fun.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.567
[Ryan] <i>Based on</i>
<i>what Stefany tells me,</i>

40:57.567 --> 40:59.467
<i>I think that</i>
<i>she's interested in me,</i>

41:00.100 --> 41:01.767
100%.

41:01.767 --> 41:04.266
Now look, I'm gonna be
down for you,

41:04.266 --> 41:06.567
but you gotta make time.
You know what I'm saying?

41:06.567 --> 41:08.266
There's plenty more dates
where this came from,

41:08.266 --> 41:09.867
in my eyes, with you.

41:10.467 --> 41:12.021
Cheers to more dates, Ryan.

41:12.021 --> 41:12.400
Cheers to more dates, Ryan.

41:12.467 --> 41:14.967
Cheers to more dates
with you, Stefany.

41:17.800 --> 41:22.567
<i>♪ I know all about it</i>
<i>You're my Cadillac love ♪</i>

41:22.567 --> 41:23.900
[Ryan] <i>Gabriel thinks</i>

41:23.967 --> 41:25.767
<i>he's sealed the deal</i>
<i>with Stefany,</i>

41:25.767 --> 41:29.166
but in my eyes, I mean,
I'm obviously the choice.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.100
That's the bottom line.

41:44.166 --> 41:45.533
[laughs]

41:45.533 --> 41:46.467
-Are you comfy,
or are you falling?
-You're gonna... I'm...

41:46.467 --> 41:47.367
-I'm perfect.
-Put your legs.

41:47.367 --> 41:49.000
[Stefany] I am perfect!

41:49.000 --> 41:50.467
You want to sit here, too?

41:50.467 --> 41:52.667
Stefany, offer him a spot,
I'm out.

41:52.667 --> 41:55.066
I know Gabriel feels
threatened by me,

41:55.066 --> 41:57.100
and I would feel
threatened by me, too.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.166
[Kelle] <i>Billy and I</i>
<i>are turning up the heat.</i>

42:00.166 --> 42:01.500
Sorry, Mom.

42:03.767 --> 42:07.266
I just don't like the fact
that Kelle's, like

42:07.266 --> 42:10.567
six feet away from me,
in your bed.

42:10.567 --> 42:11.467
I think you're being
a little bit

42:11.467 --> 42:12.021
too overprotective.

42:12.021 --> 42:13.100
too overprotective.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.767
And now, for the bad news.

42:16.767 --> 42:17.767
-Ooh!
-Oh!

42:17.800 --> 42:20.000
There is one mother
and one son going home.

42:20.066 --> 42:21.000
-[gasps]
-[April J] Oh, no!

42:21.000 --> 42:21.867
-[Pola] What the...
-[Shannan] No.

42:21.867 --> 42:23.367
-[Pola] What?
-[Stefany] No.

42:23.367 --> 42:26.266
-[Gabriel] Are you serious?
-I didn't think
anybody was going home.

42:26.266 --> 42:28.166
-It's not a joke.
-Hey, show me
that thing it's in.

42:28.166 --> 42:29.467
It just got real.

42:29.467 --> 42:30.266
It's just shocking.
