01:14.960 --> 01:17.540
Wow! It's
the Grutely Volunteers.

01:17.540 --> 01:20.920
I wonder why Roger and Anita
need their help.

01:20.920 --> 01:22.620
man:
Well, the truth is, folks,

01:22.620 --> 01:25.120
the Grutely Volunteer
Fire Department

01:25.120 --> 01:27.080
needs your help.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.830
Oh, not again!

01:30.830 --> 01:33.170
Well, don't just stand there,
put it out!

01:36.040 --> 01:37.540
You see, folks,

01:37.540 --> 01:41.330
Old Red here keeps
a-catchin' on fire.

01:41.330 --> 01:42.830
And the Bank of De Vil

01:42.830 --> 01:45.170
won't lend us the money
for an overhaul.

01:45.170 --> 01:48.540
Oh, yeah, well, you can't fight
fires without equipment.

01:48.540 --> 01:50.330
Anita: Roger and I will be
happy to help

01:50.330 --> 01:51.920
in any way we can, Chief.

01:51.920 --> 01:55.080
Uh, thanks,
but what I really need

01:55.080 --> 01:57.960
is the help
of your Dalmatian pups.

01:57.960 --> 01:59.750
Huh?

01:59.750 --> 02:03.620
We'd like to raise money
with a mascot contest.

02:03.620 --> 02:06.580
And we'd like to hold it
right here on the farm.

02:06.580 --> 02:09.580
Folks can pay to sponsor
their favorite puppy,

02:09.580 --> 02:13.170
and at the end of the day,
we'll crown the winner

02:13.170 --> 02:15.540
our Chief Firedog!

02:16.710 --> 02:18.960
-Whoa!
-Mmm!

02:18.960 --> 02:22.040
Best of all,
you'll be helping to restore

02:22.040 --> 02:24.420
an aging beauty.

02:24.420 --> 02:25.580
Aaaaah!

02:28.920 --> 02:31.540
Wow! Chief Firedog.

02:31.540 --> 02:33.960
I can totally see it now.

02:33.960 --> 02:37.460
Why, if I was Chief Firedog,
I'd proclaim

02:37.460 --> 02:39.960
a hydrant for every dog!

02:45.880 --> 02:49.250
I'd be the envy
of all my fellow canines.

02:49.250 --> 02:51.670
Cadpig: Attention,
Flight Director Lucky.

02:51.670 --> 02:53.880
Your ego trip
has been cancelled.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.210
Now, if I was
Chief Firedog,

02:56.210 --> 02:59.960
I'd use my title to promote
peace among all species.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.500
Be not afraid, little ones.

03:02.500 --> 03:06.040
Animals of all types
would admire my compassion.

03:09.880 --> 03:13.330
Gosh, you know what I'd do
if I was Chief Firedog?

03:13.330 --> 03:15.710
Why, I'd crank the sirens

03:15.710 --> 03:18.830
so Old Red could speed through
traffic in an emergency.

03:21.750 --> 03:23.620
May I take
your order, Rolly?

03:23.620 --> 03:27.080
Ah, my chest would swell
with pride

03:27.080 --> 03:29.290
if I was Chief Firedog.

03:29.290 --> 03:31.170
You know,
you're right, kids.

03:31.170 --> 03:33.830
Being Chief Firedog
is a thrill.

03:33.830 --> 03:37.210
But seeing as we're Dalmatians,
it's also our family duty.

03:37.210 --> 03:39.670
In fact, our family
has a tradition

03:39.670 --> 03:42.080
of being the best firedogs
in the land,

03:42.080 --> 03:46.080
beginning with your great great
great grandfather Rolando.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.830
Hey, I look just like him.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.580
Your mother and I
always hoped you'd follow

03:51.580 --> 03:53.000
in his paw steps,
Rolly.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.540
Rolly as Chief Firedog?

03:55.540 --> 03:57.040
Gimme a break.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.750
Yeah, our Rolando's
a bit too rotundo.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.500
Don't be discouraged,
Rolly.

04:04.500 --> 04:07.460
Remember, when it comes
to setting goals for yourself,

04:07.460 --> 04:10.380
if you can imagine it,
you can become it.

04:11.830 --> 04:13.120
Yeah, so there!

04:13.120 --> 04:15.880
I can be Chief Firedog!

04:15.880 --> 04:17.750
Sure, Rolly,
and remember,

04:17.750 --> 04:19.000
there's
no pressure.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.960
Just your family's
honor at stake.

04:26.250 --> 04:29.000
Cruella:
Chief Firedog contest?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.830
"This Saturday
at the Dearly Farm,

04:30.830 --> 04:34.170
sponsor your favorite puppy
with a donation to the
Grutely Fire Department"?

04:34.170 --> 04:36.830
Ohh! Do you know
what this means?

04:36.830 --> 04:38.500
Balloons and ice cream

04:38.500 --> 04:41.080
and cute little happy puppies.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.380
Ooh!

04:42.380 --> 04:43.920
No!

04:43.920 --> 04:46.000
It means I'll lose a fortune!

04:46.000 --> 04:47.250
For years, I've been trying

04:47.250 --> 04:49.750
to drive the Grutely Volunteers
out of business

04:49.750 --> 04:51.830
so I could debut
my new product:

04:51.830 --> 04:54.920
the De Vil Dime-a-Drip
Fire Hydrant.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.830
It looks like a fire hydrant
but works like a parking meter.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.620
Just drop in
your change up here,

05:00.620 --> 05:02.880
and a carefully regulated
ration of water

05:02.880 --> 05:04.040
spills out here.

05:04.040 --> 05:07.830
Because with Cruella de Vil,
a drop in my bucket

05:07.830 --> 05:10.040
means a drop in your bucket.

05:10.040 --> 05:11.540
both: Huh?

05:11.540 --> 05:14.500
Now, go destroy that contest!

05:14.500 --> 05:15.620
We've got to make sure

05:15.620 --> 05:18.460
the Grutely Volunteers
don't make a cent!

05:19.830 --> 05:23.120
Well, you know, guys,
when I'm Chief Firedog,

05:23.120 --> 05:26.210
you can come visit me
at the firehouse
whenever you want.

05:26.210 --> 05:29.750
But Dad said it's my destiny
to be Chief Firedog.

05:29.750 --> 05:33.920
He said if I can imagine it,
I can become it.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.210
Well, right now, Rolly,

05:35.210 --> 05:37.750
I'm imagining you're
a hopeless dreamer.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.120
Look, you've become one!

05:45.920 --> 05:47.790
Pug:
Now hear this, cadets!

05:47.790 --> 05:51.710
Chief Firedog honors
don't come easy.

05:51.710 --> 05:53.460
all: Sergeant Pug?

05:55.670 --> 05:58.620
A firedog has to be
more than just cute,

05:58.620 --> 06:02.620
they gotta be a lean, mean,
fire-fightin' machine!

06:02.620 --> 06:04.500
And that means training.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.080
So front and center, puppies!

06:08.290 --> 06:10.500
Hey, what about chickens?

06:10.500 --> 06:14.790
Sorry, needle neck.
Poultry don't qualify.

06:14.790 --> 06:18.830
But I do know a position where
you exceed qualifications.

06:18.830 --> 06:19.790
What's that?

06:19.790 --> 06:21.960
A rescue dummy.

06:21.960 --> 06:23.540
Attention!

06:23.540 --> 06:26.040
The firemen have designed
an obstacle course

06:26.040 --> 06:28.580
to test your firedog skills.

06:28.580 --> 06:30.620
Starting with one paw
on the cone,

06:30.620 --> 06:32.540
first pull the fire axe
out of the stump,

06:32.540 --> 06:34.420
then it's over the monkey bars.

06:34.420 --> 06:35.920
After a jump
over the water trough,

06:35.920 --> 06:37.790
it's up and down
the fire pole.

06:37.790 --> 06:40.380
Then through the tires
and leap onto the fire hose reel

06:40.380 --> 06:41.670
to unwind the hose.

06:41.670 --> 06:44.830
Last, grab our rescue dummy
and jump into the fire blanket

06:44.830 --> 06:46.750
for the old
"stop, drop and roll!"

06:46.750 --> 06:50.330
Now, who wants to go first?

07:01.210 --> 07:04.000
Sorry, Grandpa Rolando.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.790
Guess, I'm just Chief Fire Dud.

07:06.790 --> 07:09.620
This barn will be
our base of operations.

07:09.620 --> 07:12.290
Now, find a way to steal
that donation box.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.790
Steal the donation box?

07:15.790 --> 07:19.750
Now, how can I create
some type of distraction?

07:19.750 --> 07:20.880
Hmm.

07:25.790 --> 07:27.580
He must have spotted

07:27.580 --> 07:28.830
a cupcake!

07:31.790 --> 07:35.290
Easy, easy there now,
little fella!

07:35.290 --> 07:39.500
Why, that's a fine
alarm bark you're
demonstrating there.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.580
Whoa!
The barn's on fire!

07:42.580 --> 07:44.080
The animals!

07:46.620 --> 07:48.380
Cruella:
That's strange.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.290
It was sunny out
just a few minutes ago.

07:50.290 --> 07:52.710
Well, don't just
stand there.

07:52.710 --> 07:54.040
Put it out!

07:59.790 --> 08:01.830
Oh, no, Tibbs!

08:04.880 --> 08:06.290
I'll get him!

08:12.670 --> 08:13.920
Huh?

08:13.920 --> 08:16.000
Introducing
the De Vil

08:16.000 --> 08:18.120
Dime-a-Drip
Fire Hydrant.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.120
Do you have
any change, sir?

08:20.120 --> 08:21.460
Change?

08:22.620 --> 08:25.540
Uh, quick,
the donation box!

08:25.540 --> 08:27.920
The donation box.
It's gone!

08:27.920 --> 08:31.420
My babies!
Somebody save my babies!

08:52.460 --> 08:53.540
Hmm?

08:53.540 --> 08:55.170
Ohh!

08:56.420 --> 08:58.580
Help! Help!

09:05.580 --> 09:07.960
Wha-- Aaaah!

09:21.500 --> 09:22.500
Huh?

09:25.960 --> 09:27.120
Aaaaah!

09:40.670 --> 09:41.710
Ohh!

09:57.420 --> 09:59.500
Aaah! Ohh!

10:02.790 --> 10:04.170
Yaah!

10:07.080 --> 10:09.210
Rolly:
Whoa, Molasses, whoa!

10:09.210 --> 10:10.580
Cruella: Ohhh!

10:20.380 --> 10:21.540
Whoa!

10:27.540 --> 10:28.830
Come on!

10:36.210 --> 10:39.380
I wonder who could
have started this fire.

10:42.580 --> 10:44.790
Whoa-a-a-a!

10:44.790 --> 10:45.880
Anita and Roger: Jasper!

10:45.880 --> 10:47.790
And where there's
Jasper...

10:47.790 --> 10:49.500
Aaaaaah!

10:52.500 --> 10:53.580
Anita and Roger: Horace!

10:53.580 --> 10:55.580
Roger: And where there's
Jasper and Horace,

10:55.580 --> 10:57.380
there's always...

10:57.380 --> 10:59.380
all: Cruella de Vil.

10:59.380 --> 11:03.500
I should have known
it was you who started
this fire.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.580
Fire

11:05.580 --> 11:07.460
I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.210
I don't even know how
to start a fire.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.460
That leaves
just one question.

11:12.460 --> 11:15.000
Who's that brave
little puppy?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.540
Roger: Him?

11:16.540 --> 11:18.960
Anita, chuckling:
Why, that's Rolly.

11:21.170 --> 11:23.460
Well, you may
call him Rolly,

11:23.460 --> 11:25.670
but I've got
another name for him.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.580
Chief Firedog!

11:29.580 --> 11:31.880
Congratulations,
pup!

11:31.880 --> 11:35.460
Rolly: I'll try to make you
proud, Grandpa Rolando.

11:57.580 --> 11:58.790
Mmmm!

12:03.920 --> 12:05.380
Hey!

12:07.500 --> 12:10.960
Rolly, you really must
learn to control
your appetite.

12:12.500 --> 12:16.290
Appetite shouldn't...
control you!

12:20.250 --> 12:21.750
Oh, Rolly!

12:21.750 --> 12:24.790
Gluttony is one of
the seven deadly sins.

12:24.790 --> 12:27.380
And, if you do that
to me again,

12:27.380 --> 12:30.380
I'm gonna violate
the other six on you!

12:34.170 --> 12:35.920
Did you say
something?

12:40.330 --> 12:44.500
man: Hmm, the chunky one
can really pack it in.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.710
Perhaps he'd like
a little dessert.

12:58.380 --> 13:02.120
Oh, papa!
The ice-cream man!

13:02.120 --> 13:04.380
Strawberry HooHa!

13:04.380 --> 13:05.500
Hooray!

13:05.500 --> 13:06.750
Whooo!

13:06.750 --> 13:08.750
Hello,
ice cream.

13:08.750 --> 13:09.920
Yum-yum.

13:12.830 --> 13:14.500
Hello, little fella.

13:14.500 --> 13:19.330
You look like you might want
a Strawberry HooHa.

13:21.040 --> 13:23.080
Go ahead, have a sip.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.380
Ahhhh!

13:29.460 --> 13:31.540
There's more
where that came from.

13:31.540 --> 13:34.250
I've got a whole
truckload.

13:36.380 --> 13:40.330
Uh-oh, someone came between
Rolly and dessert.

13:40.330 --> 13:41.580
Where am I?

13:56.120 --> 13:57.290
Ahem.

14:02.540 --> 14:05.960
Hey, the ice cream guy's
taking off with Rolly.

14:10.290 --> 14:12.330
His food-first attitude

14:12.330 --> 14:14.380
has gotten him
in trouble again.

14:14.380 --> 14:15.920
We've gotta rescue him.

14:15.920 --> 14:20.540
Huh. We can follow
the ice-cream scent.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.040
Come on!

14:26.790 --> 14:30.920
(puppies yipping,
chimes playing)

14:39.040 --> 14:40.710
Uggh!

14:43.420 --> 14:45.750
Mother fed you well,
didn't she?

14:53.380 --> 14:54.790
Pudgy, aren't we, today?

14:54.790 --> 14:56.670
Whoaaaa!

14:56.670 --> 14:58.330
Ohh!

14:58.330 --> 14:59.250
Uggggh!

15:04.210 --> 15:07.670
What a lucky little gluttonous
poochy you are.

15:09.790 --> 15:11.960
You're going to be
the first to taste

15:11.960 --> 15:14.210
the new-and-improved
HooHa.

15:24.670 --> 15:28.210
The only frozen dairy product
that makes you lighter than air

15:28.210 --> 15:30.580
because it's 99% helium.

15:30.580 --> 15:33.580
The more you eat,
the lighter you get.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.710
Ahem.

15:39.080 --> 15:41.080
-Ugggh!
-Arrgh!

15:43.830 --> 15:47.460
Oh! Can't get in
that way.

15:47.460 --> 15:49.290
Hey, let's try
over there.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.290
Lucky:
Check the windows.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.710
Waaah!

16:06.210 --> 16:08.790
Hey, over here.

16:10.040 --> 16:13.000
It's a laboratory
with animals in cages.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.710
How unenlightened.

16:14.710 --> 16:17.920
Treating us like we're
lower lifeforms.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.120
Rolly:
Cadpig, is that you?

16:21.080 --> 16:23.880
I'd know that
belch anywhere.

16:23.880 --> 16:26.960
Hi, guys.
What are you doing here?

16:26.960 --> 16:29.830
Trying to get you
out of this dungeon.

16:29.830 --> 16:32.830
Dungeon?
There's free HooHas.

16:32.830 --> 16:34.620
They don't cost nothin'!

16:34.620 --> 16:37.080
They cost you
your freedom.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.620
Oh, whaddya mean?
I like it here.

16:39.620 --> 16:43.420
He doesn't realize.
He's drunk with calories.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.210
This is serious.

16:45.210 --> 16:46.830
We'd better get
Mom and Dad.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.750
You don't have a clue
why you're here, do ya?

16:50.750 --> 16:53.580
Sure. It's 'cause
I like ice cream.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.170
No. Because you're
being tested.

16:56.170 --> 16:58.040
Tested?
Tested for what?

16:58.040 --> 17:00.040
Turtle: Hey, wake up
and smell the coffee!

17:00.040 --> 17:01.960
They're testing
food additives on us.

17:01.960 --> 17:04.290
I've been eating
mocha, espresso, java,
jolt juice for weeks!

17:04.290 --> 17:06.250
I'm about to jump
out of my shell!

17:06.250 --> 17:08.750
Eh-eh-oooooh!
Eh-eh!

17:08.750 --> 17:10.040
They're using us to find out

17:10.040 --> 17:14.170
if the stuff they put in
the ice cream has side effects.

17:14.170 --> 17:15.960
You look fine to me.

17:19.210 --> 17:22.380
They've been testing
glow-in-the-dark
sprinkles on me.

17:22.380 --> 17:25.210
I can't sneak around at night
shining like a beacon.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.000
How can I knock over
garbage cans and steal food

17:28.000 --> 17:29.330
in this condition?

17:29.330 --> 17:30.420
Ohh.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.830
Wonder what HooHa Lite
will do to me.

17:32.830 --> 17:35.380
Lucky was right,
I gotta get outta here!

17:36.880 --> 17:39.790
And he's in a cage
and he can't get out.

17:41.170 --> 17:44.540
Huh. His digestion is
giving me indigestion.

17:44.540 --> 17:45.960
Let's get a move on.

17:47.330 --> 17:48.960
Okay, here's the plan.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.830
Rolly, you divert him
whilst I steal the keys.

17:51.830 --> 17:54.330
Swifty, once we're out,
you run interference.

17:54.330 --> 17:55.830
You guys all right
with this?

17:55.830 --> 17:59.210
Well, I am, but Swifty here
seems a little nervous.

17:59.210 --> 18:00.380
What do you mean?

18:00.380 --> 18:03.830
I've never been so relaxed
in all my life!

18:03.830 --> 18:07.120
Here he comes!

18:10.420 --> 18:11.920
Hello again.

18:11.920 --> 18:15.040
Time to examine you
for side effects.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.500
And you have so many sides
to choose from.

18:23.080 --> 18:25.960
Good heavens, you've eaten
five pounds of HooHa Lite

18:25.960 --> 18:27.670
and taken off ten!

18:27.670 --> 18:29.420
I must record this data.

18:29.420 --> 18:31.000
Where is that ledger?

18:38.040 --> 18:39.830
Hey, where is he going?

18:39.830 --> 18:43.120
Where are you, you spotted
little suction pump, you?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.960
HooHa is light!

18:46.960 --> 18:49.000
I think we used
a bit too much helium.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.540
Come here!

18:51.540 --> 18:53.000
Aaaah!

18:53.000 --> 18:55.120
Oh, dear. Uggh!

18:58.580 --> 19:00.250
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

19:02.790 --> 19:04.790
Here he comes.

19:06.670 --> 19:07.880
Uggh!

19:07.880 --> 19:10.330
Like taking candy from a baby.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.460
This calls for the net.

19:14.460 --> 19:15.880
Good diversion, Rollster.

19:15.880 --> 19:19.120
Yeah, I improvised.
But how do I get down?

19:20.830 --> 19:23.040
Hurry, everybody,
he'll be back any second.

19:23.040 --> 19:26.330
Don't worry,
I'll keep him busy.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.080
Aha! Hee hee!

19:34.040 --> 19:35.710
Ooh!

19:38.500 --> 19:40.880
I'm all right.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.880
I'm all right.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.580
Ohhhh...

19:46.580 --> 19:49.750
Follow me.
I'll light the way.

19:53.170 --> 19:54.210
Ouch!

19:54.210 --> 19:57.040
Guys, don't leave me here!

19:57.040 --> 19:59.420
Ah-chooo!
Chooo! Chooo!

19:59.420 --> 20:03.420
In case of a water landing,
you are my flotation device.

20:03.420 --> 20:06.000
Come back here!

20:08.040 --> 20:11.040
You floating fleabag!

20:17.210 --> 20:18.620
Whoaaa!

20:23.330 --> 20:26.880
Ooh! Oh, nooooo!

20:29.290 --> 20:31.710
Bombs away!

20:38.830 --> 20:39.960
Aaaah!

20:44.580 --> 20:46.290
Oh, that smarts.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.710
Whoaaaa!

20:54.420 --> 20:57.120
No, not the sprinkles.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.670
Not the sprinkles!

21:00.460 --> 21:02.750
Nooo!

21:09.960 --> 21:12.790
Wait! Here comes Rolly.

21:15.880 --> 21:19.170
I... I ate
too much, Ma.

21:19.170 --> 21:23.170
Rolly, we've told you
never to take candy
from strangers.

21:23.170 --> 21:25.290
I hope you've learned
your lesson.

21:25.290 --> 21:27.170
We should ground you for this.

21:27.170 --> 21:30.830
Wow! Would ya?
The sooner, the better, Dad.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.210
That's better.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.000
Ya-hoo-ha!

21:44.790 --> 21:48.920
Come back here, I'm not finished
with my experiments yet.

21:48.920 --> 21:49.960
Huh?

21:49.960 --> 21:51.880
Oh, no.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.170
Help!

21:54.830 --> 21:58.750
Say, get me down this instant!

21:58.750 --> 22:02.920
Oh, this isn't faaaaaair!

22:04.040 --> 22:06.710
Talk about
your just desserts.
