14:05.620 --> 14:07.174
Hurry up.

14:18.466 --> 14:19.365
I'm pinned down.

14:19.367 --> 14:21.667
Master, we're running out of time.

14:21.669 --> 14:22.969
[Bombs beeping]

14:22.971 --> 14:24.070
I know.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.305
We have to do something, and quick.

14:26.307 --> 14:29.308
[Blasters firing]

14:32.055 --> 14:34.347
Ahsoka.
They're weak from the side.

14:34.349 --> 14:36.115
I've got an angle on your droid.

14:38.776 --> 14:39.285
[Lightsabers humming]

14:39.287 --> 14:41.454
Okay, I've got a view of yours too.

14:41.456 --> 14:42.722
Same time.

14:42.724 --> 14:43.623
Ready?

14:43.625 --> 14:44.991
[Bombs beeping]

14:44.993 --> 14:46.192
Go!

14:46.194 --> 14:47.794

14:55.804 --> 14:57.804
[Bombs power down]

15:00.051 --> 15:01.707
That was a close one.

15:01.709 --> 15:04.343
Let's hope Obi-Wan shares our luck.

15:04.345 --> 15:05.845

[Panting]

15:22.901 --> 15:28.003
[Birds chirping] [Animals screeching]

15:35.856 --> 15:38.950
Now I'll take revenge
for my people, Jedi.

15:39.190 --> 15:41.906
Sir, you have an urgent transmission.

15:41.908 --> 15:45.576
Sorry to interrupt, sir, but
you weren't responding.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.577
What is it?

15:46.579 --> 15:51.115
Uh... the Jedi have
disarmed your bombs.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.646
What?

15:55.822 --> 15:59.857
Give me the detonator.

15:59.859 --> 16:01.859
Beep!

16:01.861 --> 16:06.531
[Detonator beeping]

16:08.097 --> 16:10.762
Certainly it took him
long enough this time.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.205
[Explosions]

16:17.739 --> 16:19.640
Shall we discuss your surrender...

16:20.872 --> 16:21.512
[Lightsaber humming]

16:21.514 --> 16:22.780
Again?

16:22.782 --> 16:27.285
I still have one bomb left, Jedi.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.252
Sir, how could you?

Get it off! Get it off!

16:38.665 --> 16:39.730
Get it off!

16:39.732 --> 16:41.432
Get it off!

Get it off!

16:44.804 --> 16:46.804
[Explosion]

16:49.565 --> 16:52.243
Anakin!
Anakin, come in.

16:52.245 --> 16:55.079
D'nar is making his
escape from the tower.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.581
On our way.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.449
[Metallic stomping]

16:58.451 --> 17:00.318
We'll never catch him in time.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.919
I am not letting that slaver

17:01.921 --> 17:03.921
scum get away.

Ahsoka, you're only making it angry.

19:09.749 --> 19:10.948
I'll handle is.

Go stabilize the ship.

20:22.288 --> 20:23.954
Where are the colonists?

20:23.956 --> 20:26.590
I will tell you nothing.

20:29.558 --> 20:30.910
Where are they?

20:33.646 --> 20:34.799
Master.

20:39.368 --> 20:45.342
My queen is going to bring back the royal
slave auction as in the days before the Jedi.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.712
Zygerria will be rich
and powerful again.

We'll see about that.

21:01.348 --> 21:05.629
General Skywalker, I ran the bio-scan
twice, but the results were negative.

21:05.631 --> 21:08.199
Are you saying the colonists
are not in the city?

21:08.201 --> 21:10.601
I'm saying they're not
even on the planet.

21:10.603 --> 21:14.438
The entire population appears
to have simply vanished.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.407
Vanished?

21:16.409 --> 21:17.741
That's impossible.

21:17.743 --> 21:21.412
Those are my people.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.981
Troubling is the return
of the Zygerrians.

21:23.983 --> 21:29.320
It is likely they mean to use Dooku
to rebuild their slaver empire.

21:29.322 --> 21:32.289
We cannot allow that, Master.

21:32.291 --> 21:36.927
Agree I do, but first find
the colonists you must.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.063
In great danger they are.

21:39.065 --> 21:42.099
What is it, Master?

Sense, I do, a darker
hand in this mystery.
