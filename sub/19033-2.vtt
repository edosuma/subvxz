WEBVTT

00:03.204 --> 00:05.404
when I
was a little boy growing up

00:05.439 --> 00:10.042
here in Mississippi, I
spent a lot of time outdoors.

00:10.311 --> 00:13.912
Part of it looking
up at the night sky.

00:13.948 --> 00:18.317
We had no electricity so
the moon was the only light

00:18.352 --> 00:21.720
that ever challenged
that of the stars.

00:21.756 --> 00:24.456
And they filled me
with such an inexpressible

00:24.492 --> 00:29.628
sense of wonder.

00:30.631 --> 00:33.499
My paternal grandmother
told me that that was where

00:33.534 --> 00:36.735
heaven was,
where god lives,

00:36.771 --> 00:42.274
the place where good
people go when they die.

00:44.879 --> 00:48.313
She also warned me
about the other place.

00:48.349 --> 00:50.082
Hell.

00:50.117 --> 00:53.318
The place you
go when you're bad.

00:53.354 --> 00:59.058
At age five or six these
ideas are a bit overwhelming.

01:00.361 --> 01:02.327
Frightening.

01:02.363 --> 01:04.763
Inspiring I guess.

01:04.799 --> 01:07.666
And I think most people,
no matter what their faith,

01:07.701 --> 01:13.272
have faced similar thoughts
and fears, what is heaven?

01:13.441 --> 01:15.441
What is hell?

01:15.476 --> 01:18.243
How have these unseen
places changed the way we

01:18.279 --> 01:22.614
live our lives on earth?

01:30.591 --> 01:33.826
To find out...

01:33.861 --> 01:35.661
Oh, look what I see.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.896
I'll descend into
the underworld of ancient

01:37.932 --> 01:39.631
native Americans.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.233
I think there's something in here

01:41.268 --> 01:43.836
that they don't want found.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.505
See people who are tormented by hell.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.476
And touched by paradise.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.177
It’s that sneak preview
of what heaven's

01:52.213 --> 01:53.278
gonna be like.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.482
I'll discover heaven in

01:56.517 --> 01:57.816
the Cambodian jungle.

01:57.852 --> 01:59.985
We really are at heaven on earth.

02:00.020 --> 02:03.122
And in one woman's
remarkable story.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.958
As far as I can tell
you just described heaven.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.193
It was my heaven.

02:08.229 --> 02:11.663
Do heaven and
hell await us in the afterlife?

02:11.699 --> 02:15.200
Or are they here and now?

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:40.995 --> 02:45.964
For how long have we been
contemplating heaven and hell?

02:48.202 --> 02:50.802
We know that more than
4,000 years ago the ancient

02:50.838 --> 02:53.872
Egyptians dreamed of their
souls traveling through a

02:53.908 --> 02:57.543
fiery underworld.

02:57.978 --> 03:01.079
And up to the stars.

03:01.115 --> 03:04.383
And the people of Stonehenge
fixed their gaze on the

03:04.418 --> 03:08.820
heavens even earlier,
some 5,000 years ago.

03:11.258 --> 03:13.825
But archaeologists have
recently found evidence of a

03:13.861 --> 03:16.528
culture that believed in
a version of heaven and hell

03:16.564 --> 03:19.798
even before those
monuments were built.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.834
It's not where you'd expect.

03:22.870 --> 03:26.471
Archaeologist Jan Simeck is
taking me to a site on the

03:26.507 --> 03:29.942
hills of Tennessee, one that
the ancient native American

03:29.977 --> 03:35.047
ancestors of the Cherokee used
for hundreds of generations.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.950
So, then where
are we going now?

03:37.985 --> 03:40.686
So, we're going
to a cave called Dunbar Cave.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.790
It's a cave that was used
for as much as 10,000 years

03:44.825 --> 03:47.226
by prehistoric people,

03:47.261 --> 03:50.762
much of that time they were
using it as a religious site,

03:50.798 --> 03:56.435
you know, kind of the
entryway to hell in our terms.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.136
These formations,

03:58.172 --> 04:02.307
they just scream ancient.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.610
Yeah, they are,
the cave itself is a very

04:04.645 --> 04:07.980
ancient place.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.390
It's beautiful isn't it?

04:18.425 --> 04:21.260
Over the centuries people
have left their mark on

04:21.295 --> 04:25.330
these walls, most have
little historical significance,

04:25.366 --> 04:29.067
but, in a chamber 200 yards
from the mouth of the cave,

04:29.103 --> 04:33.605
Jan's archaeological team has
made a stunning discovery,

04:33.641 --> 04:37.876
artwork that could represent
humanities oldest imaginings

04:37.911 --> 04:39.778
of heaven and hell.

04:39.813 --> 04:42.047
So, Morgan, this is Beau Caroll,

04:42.082 --> 04:44.883
a graduate student of
anthropology and a member of

04:44.918 --> 04:48.453
the eastern band of
Cherokee Indians.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.290
Look at this.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.025
So, what we're
looking at here are

04:53.060 --> 04:55.160
these two symbols,
one looks like a star,

04:55.195 --> 04:57.763
one could resemble a comet.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.132
So, the original peoples
came down and

05:00.167 --> 05:04.002
they made these symbols
representative of what?

05:04.038 --> 05:06.004
Some people have
actually interpreted this

05:06.040 --> 05:08.940
cross and circle image as a
sign that represents the upper

05:08.976 --> 05:13.045
world above, the middle
world and the world below.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.280
Cherokee people
believe that they came from

05:15.316 --> 05:17.482
the stars, and they were
put here in the underworld,

05:17.518 --> 05:20.018
in earth, and we were
born from the earth.

05:20.054 --> 05:23.655
I think that this could
be a depiction of that.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.924
The Cherokee
believe the universe is

05:25.959 --> 05:28.527
encased in a stone sphere.

05:28.562 --> 05:32.064
Inside are three
levels of existence.

05:32.099 --> 05:36.435
Cherokee souls are created amid
the stars of the upper world,

05:36.470 --> 05:40.572
then they sink deep underground
into the lower world where they

05:40.607 --> 05:43.108
await their birth
into the middle world,

05:43.143 --> 05:44.943
the land of the living.

05:44.978 --> 05:48.680
At death their soul returns
underground and then travels

05:48.716 --> 05:51.083
back up to the stars.

05:51.118 --> 05:55.687
Closing an endless cycle
of life, death and rebirth.

05:58.225 --> 06:01.593
For the ancient Cherokee,
to enter this cave was to set

06:01.628 --> 06:04.963
foot into the lower world,
a place where the living

06:04.998 --> 06:07.833
did not belong.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.969
Oh, look what I see.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.504
What do I see?

06:12.539 --> 06:14.506
So, we're looking
here at a reclining

06:14.541 --> 06:17.209
human figure,
about 6 and a half feet long.

06:17.244 --> 06:20.812
His head is pointed down
into the depths of the cave,

06:20.848 --> 06:24.516
so this is a warrior
floating into the death realm

06:24.551 --> 06:27.919
of the underworld.

06:28.422 --> 06:31.590
Do you get a
special feeling coming into

06:31.625 --> 06:37.229
these caves and knowing the
ancestry of that part of your?

06:37.264 --> 06:39.164
I get nervous.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.665
But you're an archaeologist.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.267
Yeah.

06:42.302 --> 06:45.003
I think that they put this
guy here because he's guarding

06:45.038 --> 06:48.240
something, I think there's
something in here that they

06:48.275 --> 06:50.308
don't want found.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.778
I think that I get that
feeling from this drawing

06:52.813 --> 06:55.747
because we're really
not supposed to be here.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.683
Jan and Beau have
brought me to the edge of

06:58.719 --> 07:01.820
the Cherokee underworld,
but I wanna know if these

07:01.855 --> 07:04.790
ancient people also tried
to make contact with their

07:04.825 --> 07:07.125
upper world, their heaven.

07:07.161 --> 07:08.593
What about the upper world?

07:08.629 --> 07:09.928
Would you like to go see?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.062
Absolutely.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.164
Let’s go.

07:12.199 --> 07:15.100
Come on.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.938
So, we're in a
place called mount bottom,

07:19.973 --> 07:23.775
it was a large village,
centered around a mound that

07:23.811 --> 07:26.878
provided access to the
upper world, the temple,

07:26.914 --> 07:29.614
and that's what
we're looking at here.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.917
This native American village,

07:31.952 --> 07:35.287
situated about 50 miles
south of the Dunbar Cave,

07:35.322 --> 07:39.357
was a center of religious
life for the Cherokee ancestors.

07:39.393 --> 07:42.661
The top of the central earthen
mound was as close to heaven

07:42.696 --> 07:46.631
as the living could get.

07:47.901 --> 07:50.502
Okay, so what happens up here?

07:50.537 --> 07:52.737
Just like with the,

07:52.773 --> 07:54.406
with the cave and the
underworld you go from...

07:54.441 --> 07:56.975
inside the cave you go
from middle to under,

07:57.010 --> 07:59.177
here it's the same thing
except we're going from

07:59.213 --> 08:00.645
middle to upper.

08:00.681 --> 08:03.982
We're right on the cusp
of a cosmic doorway.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.584
Can you be a little bit more specific

08:05.619 --> 08:07.085
About what that is?

08:07.120 --> 08:09.988
When we say you're on the cusp
of a cosmic doorway, who is?

08:10.023 --> 08:11.389
The living?

08:11.425 --> 08:13.925
So, all these people
that have passed on

08:13.961 --> 08:17.162
before us they're
essentially in another world,

08:17.197 --> 08:20.599
they can hear us if we talk
to them in the right way,

08:20.634 --> 08:22.934
if we dance the right way,
if we sing the right song,

08:22.970 --> 08:25.704
then those people can hear us,
and those people know that we

08:25.739 --> 08:27.239
haven't forgotten who they were,

08:27.274 --> 08:29.207
we haven't forgotten who we were.

08:29.243 --> 08:33.812
Everything wants to go up,
and if you build this up here

08:33.847 --> 08:36.381
and have the same dances it
would be heard better than

08:36.416 --> 08:39.518
doing it down on the ground.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.886
So the higher
you go the more you're likely

08:41.922 --> 08:47.759
to be in touch with the
elders or the gods...

08:47.794 --> 08:51.363
whoever wants to listen.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.833
Right.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.669
Going into the Dunbar Cave
I felt like Orpheus must have

08:57.704 --> 09:00.138
when he descended into hell.

09:00.173 --> 09:06.511
And it made me realize how
ancient and universal our

09:07.881 --> 09:11.383
connection with
heaven and hell is.

09:11.418 --> 09:14.786
I felt a vague sense
of fear as I moved deeper

09:14.821 --> 09:17.188
into the darkness of the cave.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.625
Likewise I felt a sense
of hope and release when

09:20.661 --> 09:23.461
I climbed to the top of the temple.

09:23.497 --> 09:27.532
We all share these
hopes and fears.

09:27.568 --> 09:32.604
We always have, we
probably always will.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.378
For thousands of years heaven
and hell have driven us to

09:40.414 --> 09:45.517
create enduring monuments,
they've inspired iconic works

09:45.552 --> 09:50.155
of art, around the world
the faithful hope for an

09:50.190 --> 09:55.126
afterlife in paradise,
or, fear eternal damnation.

09:56.096 --> 10:02.000
But sometimes hell
visits people on earth.

10:09.509 --> 10:13.378
In Ethiopia, many people
believe evil spirits can take

10:13.413 --> 10:16.715
over the bodies of the living.

10:16.750 --> 10:22.253
One way to chase them out
is to undergo an exorcism.

10:30.697 --> 10:33.498
Historian, Nancy Caciola,
and religions scholar,

10:33.533 --> 10:37.736
Solomon Getina have
come to Debre Libanos,

10:37.771 --> 10:43.108
a seventh century monastery of
the Ethiopian orthodox church.

10:44.111 --> 10:48.513
It's a site with a long
history of exorcism.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.515
I can't wait to see what it's like.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.851
Yeah.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.187
I will take you inside
and you will see how

10:56.223 --> 11:00.091
people get healed.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.631
Ethiopian Christians believe demonic

11:06.667 --> 11:10.135
possession manifests
itself in many ways.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.104
From the mild pain of
a headache to extreme

11:13.140 --> 11:17.242
hallucinations and
emotional disturbances.

11:21.615 --> 11:24.149
People travel here from
all over Ethiopia to

11:24.184 --> 11:26.685
rid themselves of
the hellish demons they

11:26.720 --> 11:29.821
believe possess them.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.728
Zelalam Gedachim is one of

11:36.763 --> 11:38.096
those people.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.864
Why were you feeling ill and why did

11:39.900 --> 11:41.366
you decide that you
needed to come here?

11:48.842 --> 11:52.077
You see, he said
he heard unusual voices.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.679
Ah, so these
voices feel sinister and

11:54.715 --> 11:56.247
evil to you?

11:56.283 --> 11:58.616
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

11:58.652 --> 12:01.286
Zelalam, like the
hundreds of other people

12:01.321 --> 12:04.422
with more severe symptoms,
has come here to be healed by

12:04.458 --> 12:08.960
St. Tekle's cross, a holy object
so revered it's always kept

12:08.995 --> 12:12.397
wrapped in cloth.

12:13.467 --> 12:16.501
St. Tekle was an Ethiopian
Orthodox monk who took charge

12:16.536 --> 12:21.539
of this monastery
in the 13th century.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.743
So this cross has a
very special power of

12:24.778 --> 12:26.644
expelling demons then?

12:26.680 --> 12:29.781
So it makes the demons
upset and that's why they

12:29.816 --> 12:31.116
react in this way?

12:31.151 --> 12:32.484
Exactly, exactly.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.018
Because the demons can't tolerate

12:34.054 --> 12:35.353
to be close to something holy?

12:35.388 --> 12:37.088
Exactly, exactly.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.256
Yeah.

12:45.632 --> 12:48.199
He’s saying
"I’m burned" demon in her

12:48.235 --> 12:50.101
is saying,
you know, you know,

12:50.137 --> 12:52.904
I'm burned,
I'm burned, I’m burned.

12:52.939 --> 12:55.607
As the cross nears the possessed they

12:55.642 --> 13:00.145
believe the demons will be
expelled from their bodies.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.935
Now it is Zelalam's turn.

13:23.970 --> 13:27.172
Despite his outward calm
he firmly believes the voice

13:27.207 --> 13:29.474
in his head is a demon.

13:29.509 --> 13:33.745
And only the cross can expel it.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.148
So he's going to beat the demon?

13:37.184 --> 13:40.318
Exactly, the ordered
to kneel down so...

13:40.353 --> 13:42.520
So the cross is for
the blessing and then

13:42.556 --> 13:44.689
if it's stubborn he'll
beat them with the strap?

13:44.724 --> 13:49.627
Exactly.

13:54.367 --> 13:55.533
So, do you feel that the evil spirits

13:55.569 --> 13:57.101
have left you now?

13:57.137 --> 13:58.369
Permanently?

14:02.275 --> 14:04.442
So, after he kissed
the cross he didn't

14:04.477 --> 14:06.277
feel the previous feeling.

14:06.313 --> 14:10.648
He said that he is
sure that he's healed.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.952
You can see that there's
this struggle going

14:13.987 --> 14:15.887
on between good and evil,

14:15.922 --> 14:17.055
heaven and hell,

14:17.090 --> 14:19.557
humanity and forces
of evil and demons.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.392
Exactly.

14:21.428 --> 14:23.561
You can see that in the
responses of people,

14:23.597 --> 14:24.929
the noises they make,

14:24.965 --> 14:27.365
the way that they
twist their bodies,

14:27.400 --> 14:31.402
you can see the struggle
that is this cosmic

14:31.438 --> 14:34.072
part of the world of good
and evil that we live in.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.041
Exactly, this is a...

14:37.077 --> 14:38.810
But it's right in the body

14:38.845 --> 14:42.280
of this individual.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.415
Ethiopian Christians see their

14:44.451 --> 14:48.386
suffering, be it illness,
conflict or any calamity that

14:48.421 --> 14:52.724
befalls them, as the shadow of
hell falling on their lives.

14:54.060 --> 14:58.496
Bowing down to the cross can
purge them of that shadow and

14:58.531 --> 15:02.367
bring them peace in this world.

15:02.402 --> 15:06.771
But where there is
darkness there is also light.

15:07.874 --> 15:10.775
Some people feel they
are touched by heaven in a

15:10.810 --> 15:13.611
physical way, every Sunday.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.924
I've come to Albuquerque,
New Mexico,

15:25.959 --> 15:28.092
to meet Annie Naz.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.627
Hi.

15:29.663 --> 15:30.995
Hi.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.163
I’m Annie.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.498
I’m Morgan.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.832
Pleased to meet you.

15:34.868 --> 15:36.901
It's my pleasure Annie.

15:36.937 --> 15:40.438
Annie's family recently
Immigrated from Pakistan

15:40.473 --> 15:42.573
to the U.S.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.511
You're from Pakistan?

15:46.546 --> 15:47.879
Right.

15:47.914 --> 15:50.915
The name Annie,

15:50.951 --> 15:52.517
isn't that a Christian name?

15:52.552 --> 15:56.020
It is, I was born in
a Pentecostal, Christian family.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.155
Yeah.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.523
Yes.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.425
But you were
not Pentecostal Christian.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.327
In the beginning I
didn't like going to church,

16:02.362 --> 16:03.795
I thought it was boring,

16:03.830 --> 16:06.364
but then I had a great
spiritual experience.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.634
One day we were worshiping
and all of a sudden

16:09.669 --> 16:12.937
I just started
feeling like crying,

16:12.973 --> 16:16.007
and I started praising god,
I started saying those words,

16:16.042 --> 16:19.377
when I started speaking
I was speaking in tongues.

16:19.412 --> 16:23.214
Okay, alright.

16:23.249 --> 16:26.951
You know, it just
changed my life in a huge,

16:26.987 --> 16:28.786
huge, huge way.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.289
Any chance I get to see you

16:31.324 --> 16:32.991
speaking in tongues?

16:33.026 --> 16:34.959
When you feel
the presence of god,

16:34.995 --> 16:36.594
even if I try to speak to you...

16:36.629 --> 16:37.895
Yeah.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.564
I just can't, my
tongue starts twisting and I

16:39.599 --> 16:42.000
start speaking in tongues,
so you might.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.901
Annie is taking me to the

16:43.937 --> 16:46.304
New Life United Pentecostal Church,

16:46.339 --> 16:50.742
where they worship
by speaking in tongues.

16:50.910 --> 16:54.245
This practice comes
from the Christian bible.

16:54.280 --> 16:58.950
According to the book of acts,
50 days after Jesus’s death,

16:58.985 --> 17:02.053
on the day of the Pentecost,
the Holy Spirit filled

17:02.088 --> 17:05.690
Christ's disciples
causing them to speak in

17:05.724 --> 17:07.258
an unknown language.

17:07.292 --> 17:10.528
Pentecostal services
recreate this moment of heaven

17:10.563 --> 17:14.031
coming down to earth.

17:14.300 --> 17:19.337
Yeah, I gotta praise,
I gotta praise now, now, now,

17:20.040 --> 17:23.374
Now, I gotta praise.

17:25.244 --> 17:27.612
Can’t stop, praising his name,

17:27.646 --> 17:31.649
I just can't stop
praising his name,

17:31.684 --> 17:37.622
I just can't stop praising
his name, Jesus, Jesus.

17:45.432 --> 17:48.332
In the name of Jesus,
in the name of Jesus.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.768
When I began to open
myself up and surrender

17:50.804 --> 17:53.604
to God and allow his
spirit to move within me,

17:53.640 --> 17:57.675
It's a sneak preview of
what heaven's gonna be like.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.278
I want you to close your eyes,
I want you to begin to pray.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.380
In your heart, right now,
I want you to open your soul

18:02.415 --> 18:04.182
and say God, here I am.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.349
I surrender to you.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.285
I don't care what
you're facing in life,

18:07.320 --> 18:09.053
what situations
you're struggling with,

18:09.089 --> 18:12.590
I'm here to tell you today
that God has the ability and

18:12.625 --> 18:15.526
the power through his
spirit to bring you out

18:15.562 --> 18:16.928
of that circumstance,

18:16.963 --> 18:19.831
to give you that heaven
can be a real place.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.967
Hallelujah, we thank you
Jesus, thank you Jesus.

18:23.002 --> 18:26.270
Thank you Jesus.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.547
In the name of Jesus right now,

18:36.583 --> 18:38.316
Let your holy spirit
begin to move!

18:56.769 --> 18:58.736
All around me people
have been swept up

18:58.771 --> 19:02.006
by an invisible force.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.642
And now they speak
what they believe is the

19:04.677 --> 19:06.878
language of heaven.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.413
I can see on their
faces that they are

19:09.449 --> 19:13.885
genuinely somewhere else.

19:22.795 --> 19:27.165
You were there for a long time.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.535
You don't have any idea
what you were saying?

19:30.570 --> 19:33.538
No, but when you
let the Holy Spirit flow

19:33.573 --> 19:39.810
through you, then, I mean,
then you don't have any control

19:40.013 --> 19:42.180
over yourself and it's
just the Holy Spirit,

19:42.215 --> 19:44.115
The Holy Spirit
speaking to you,

19:44.150 --> 19:45.683
And I can't wait
till I go to heaven,

19:45.718 --> 19:48.419
because that's how
I will be at all times.

19:48.454 --> 19:50.121
Well, you know,

19:50.156 --> 19:52.690
I've been going to the
cultural experiences of

19:52.725 --> 19:55.726
different religions
and belief systems,

19:55.762 --> 19:59.530
and the thing that I have
learned is that everybody's

19:59.566 --> 20:03.434
truth is the truth.

20:10.710 --> 20:13.844
That was quite a
powerful experience.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.480
I could...

20:16.516 --> 20:22.386
feel the energy in that space.

20:22.422 --> 20:28.859
Normal people suddenly
transformed by some power.

20:29.495 --> 20:34.932
And then just as suddenly
return to normal.

20:34.968 --> 20:38.869
Pentecostals believe that
they are bringing heaven down to

20:38.905 --> 20:44.075
earth, now, whatever it is,
once they felt that power

20:44.110 --> 20:46.210
they're not the same.

20:46.246 --> 20:51.282
Experience changes them.

20:51.317 --> 20:56.654
How they see themselves,
how they relate to others...

20:58.958 --> 21:03.494
how they live their lives.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.897
The Pentecostals feel the
presence of heaven through

21:06.933 --> 21:09.634
their unique ritual.

21:09.669 --> 21:14.171
But one Hindu king physically
built heaven on earth.

21:14.207 --> 21:17.908
To entice the gods
to reside in there.

21:23.449 --> 21:27.251
Mississippi is my home.

21:27.287 --> 21:30.321
Being here just feels...

21:30.356 --> 21:32.590
right.

21:32.625 --> 21:36.160
To me it's like heaven on earth.

21:36.195 --> 21:41.699
And we all yearn for that
place where you're at ease,

21:41.734 --> 21:45.269
the place where you
feel you belong.

21:45.305 --> 21:49.206
The ancient Jews sought
the heaven of their homeland

21:49.242 --> 21:52.476
when they left Babylon.

21:52.512 --> 21:57.815
The Mormons found theirs
by the Great Salt Lake.

21:57.850 --> 22:03.487
It's a universal human
urge to find your heaven

22:03.523 --> 22:07.158
here, and now.

22:15.301 --> 22:21.072
In the jungles of Cambodia,
over 900 years ago,

22:21.107 --> 22:25.409
one king built his
own heaven on earth.

22:30.583 --> 22:35.219
This is Angkor Wat.

22:36.856 --> 22:41.625
It's the largest religious
monument in the world.

22:42.595 --> 22:45.162
Today it's a Buddhist temple,

22:45.198 --> 22:48.466
but that wasn't
always the case.

22:48.501 --> 22:51.502
It was originally
constructed by the king of

22:51.537 --> 22:54.772
the Khmer empire,
Suryavarman II,

22:54.807 --> 22:58.609
as a model of Hindu heaven.

23:08.287 --> 23:11.055
Hey David, how are you?

23:12.458 --> 23:13.657
It's been a while.

23:13.693 --> 23:14.925
Right.

23:14.961 --> 23:16.160
Welcome, welcome.

23:16.195 --> 23:17.962
Thank you, Thank you, very much.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.431
Archaeologist, David Brotherson,

23:20.466 --> 23:22.099
as enlisted the aid of
Cambodian historian,

23:22.135 --> 23:25.269
Syan Superovi to understand
why this incredible

23:25.304 --> 23:26.937
site was built.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.273
It’s mind boggling how much work

23:29.308 --> 23:31.942
was put into building this
immaculate building.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.277
Tremendously.

23:33.312 --> 23:35.646
And the amount of manpower that was

23:35.681 --> 23:38.883
deployed here, there must
have been a very important

23:38.918 --> 23:41.619
underlying reason for them
to go to all this effort?

23:41.654 --> 23:45.022
Definitely.

23:45.491 --> 23:48.626
This whole complex
itself is the symbolisms of

23:48.661 --> 23:50.895
the entire universe.

23:50.930 --> 23:54.865
Moat, in the Hindu mythology,
Moat is symbolizing the oceans

23:54.901 --> 23:58.936
that is surrounding
Mount Meru.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.305
In Hindu mythology,

24:01.340 --> 24:03.941
the five peaks of
Mount Meru are the center

24:03.976 --> 24:05.810
of the universe.

24:05.845 --> 24:09.246
The heavenly abode of the gods.

24:11.417 --> 24:13.517
So, the Moats which surround these

24:13.553 --> 24:17.955
temples are huge, and they
symbolize the ocean that

24:17.990 --> 24:20.958
surrounds where the gods live.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.494
The entire complex itself
symbolizing the

24:23.529 --> 24:24.929
universe, right?

24:24.964 --> 24:27.531
But, this temple, it's not only that,

24:27.567 --> 24:31.368
it is the heaven on earth,
it is the place called the

24:31.404 --> 24:35.306
highest world of Vishnu,
in Sanskrit it's called...

24:37.710 --> 24:39.410
I believe
I read the translation,

24:39.445 --> 24:43.514
It's a sacred paradise
of Vishnu as well.

24:43.549 --> 24:46.016
The Hindu god, Vishnu,

24:46.052 --> 24:48.919
Is the protector of
creation and Angkor Wat was

24:48.955 --> 24:50.855
built for him.

24:50.890 --> 24:53.524
Inside the temple are
over 12,000 square feet of

24:53.559 --> 24:56.760
intricately carved reliefs.

24:56.796 --> 25:00.164
One relief was created
to link king Suryavarman II

25:00.199 --> 25:04.301
to Vishnu himself.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.606
Look, you can see that by relief,

25:08.641 --> 25:10.708
the king who build this temple,

25:10.743 --> 25:12.943
and if you look
closely over there,

25:12.979 --> 25:14.745
there is an
inscription saying...

25:19.585 --> 25:23.988
Meaning that he is the king
who went through the highest

25:24.023 --> 25:28.058
world of Vishnu.

25:30.496 --> 25:32.830
Archaeologists
aren't sure whether

25:32.865 --> 25:35.599
the king is buried here,
but local people believe that

25:35.635 --> 25:40.471
his spirit resides here
in Vishnu’s paradise.

25:40.606 --> 25:43.140
That paradise, that heaven,

25:43.175 --> 25:47.278
lies at the top
of the central tower.

25:47.613 --> 25:50.414
So they believe that Suryavarman II's

25:50.449 --> 25:53.684
spirit would inhabit these
towers in the afterlife?

25:53.719 --> 25:55.886
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.856
If you look at the steps, you
know, like the wider the step,

25:58.891 --> 26:03.727
why it's too narrow, you know,
like it can be implied the

26:03.763 --> 26:06.730
ideas of that you are
approaching the worlds of god

26:06.766 --> 26:10.067
is not that easy.

26:10.937 --> 26:12.503
Alright, well,

26:12.538 --> 26:14.338
let's not wait a moment
longer, let's go up.

26:14.373 --> 26:18.008
Please come.

26:30.523 --> 26:32.957
The peak of the temple
was believed by the

26:32.992 --> 26:36.093
khmer to be the highest
reaches of heaven and the

26:36.128 --> 26:39.430
realm of Vishnu himself.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.239
David, what do you think?

26:49.275 --> 26:51.642
I think that everyone is impressed

26:51.677 --> 26:53.110
by your ancestors.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.511
Yeah, yeah.

26:54.547 --> 26:56.647
This is phenomenal.

26:56.682 --> 26:59.516
Perhaps they were
building such immaculate,

26:59.552 --> 27:02.586
beautiful structures
to entice the gods to inhabit

27:02.622 --> 27:05.990
these structures so that
the priests, the king,

27:06.025 --> 27:09.159
would have had this
opportunity to have a direct

27:09.195 --> 27:12.262
connection with the supernatural.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.797
That’s true.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.533
Even if you're not a spiritual person

27:16.569 --> 27:20.004
you can feel the aura of
this kind of place, you know,

27:20.039 --> 27:23.907
we really are
at heaven on earth.

27:27.413 --> 27:30.414
Angkor Wat is
an impressive example of

27:30.449 --> 27:35.319
one man's attempt to
build a heaven on earth, but,

27:35.354 --> 27:39.990
I wonder does it have
to be so monumental?

27:40.026 --> 27:43.394
So elaborate?

27:44.363 --> 27:48.365
2,000 years ago,
in Galilee and Jerusalem,

27:48.401 --> 27:52.236
a man called Jesus
began his ministry.

27:52.271 --> 27:55.305
He told his followers
that they would inherit the

27:55.341 --> 27:58.509
kingdom of heaven.

27:58.544 --> 28:00.444
I've always struggled to
understand what he meant

28:00.479 --> 28:04.982
by that, whether the
heaven he spoke of was

28:05.017 --> 28:08.619
up in the sky or down
here on earth.

28:19.165 --> 28:21.598
There's one group of
Christians that might know the

28:21.634 --> 28:24.201
answer to that question.

28:24.236 --> 28:27.404
The Assyrian Christian church
dates its foundation to just a

28:27.440 --> 28:30.607
few years after Jesus’s death.

28:30.643 --> 28:36.013
It claims its theology is
what Jesus himself believed.

28:36.182 --> 28:39.616
For them, heaven means
being close to god,

28:39.652 --> 28:43.987
hell is being far from god.

28:44.023 --> 28:48.425
The Assyrian community's
home is now called Iraq.

28:53.566 --> 28:56.567
So, I wanted to understand
how you can find a piece of

28:56.602 --> 29:01.805
heaven when you are living
in what became hell on earth?

29:12.752 --> 29:14.785
I've been invited
to break bread with two

29:14.820 --> 29:19.156
Assyrians from Baghdad.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.226
Hi, how are you sir?

29:22.261 --> 29:23.761
Just fine, how are you?

29:23.796 --> 29:25.496
Mervat Schlyaman...

29:25.531 --> 29:26.930
Nice to see you.

29:26.966 --> 29:28.766
And her son, Mattius Aneuam.

29:28.801 --> 29:31.101
Hi, my name's Mattius.

29:31.137 --> 29:32.236
Mattius.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.671
Nice to meet you, have a seat.

29:34.707 --> 29:36.607
Would you like some tea?

29:36.642 --> 29:40.410
Thank you, that would be nice.

29:41.580 --> 29:43.180
Ah.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.449
You're from Iraq?

29:45.484 --> 29:47.117
Uh huh, yes.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.886
But you're not Iraqi?

29:48.921 --> 29:50.888
You are?

29:50.923 --> 29:52.556
We’re Assyrian Christians,

29:52.591 --> 29:54.625
we lived in Iraq
for over 2,000 years.

29:54.660 --> 29:55.993
How old are you?

29:56.028 --> 29:58.762
I'm just kidding.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.231
But the Assyrian Christians
have been there since

30:01.267 --> 30:03.033
the time of Jesus?

30:04.570 --> 30:09.173
You were in Iraq and then the

30:09.208 --> 30:11.341
civil war broke out?

30:11.377 --> 30:13.110
Yes.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.946
That's the insurgence against

30:15.981 --> 30:17.447
the government?

30:18.984 --> 30:20.217
And you were still there?

30:20.252 --> 30:21.518
Yes.

30:21.554 --> 30:22.886
During the war?

30:22.922 --> 30:24.454
Must have been awful.

30:31.230 --> 30:34.464
She’s saying,
before the war started the

30:34.500 --> 30:36.567
Muslim and the Christian
community they were all

30:36.602 --> 30:39.336
peaceful, everyone was
treated equally, but,

30:39.371 --> 30:41.738
when the war started everything

30:41.774 --> 30:43.774
started going downhill.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.117
Is that problematical?

30:54.153 --> 30:56.186
That you were
Assyrian Christians in a

30:56.222 --> 30:59.089
largely Muslim country?

31:05.030 --> 31:07.164
There was no law and order between

31:07.199 --> 31:11.702
the communities, and
the militants thought that

31:11.737 --> 31:15.572
the Christians were working
with the American soldiers,

31:15.608 --> 31:19.509
so, started creating problems.

31:26.619 --> 31:28.719
The insurgents,

31:28.754 --> 31:31.021
they put bombs in cars and
they used to really to put 'em

31:31.056 --> 31:33.757
like in front of churches
and other religious areas and

31:33.792 --> 31:36.760
they'd blow 'em up.

31:40.199 --> 31:44.067
Didn’t that frighten you?

31:50.376 --> 31:53.176
She said, yeah, it frightened us.

31:53.212 --> 31:55.779
We hear like that
church got blown up,

31:55.814 --> 31:59.049
it struck fear in our hearts.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.617
We started getting threats.

32:00.653 --> 32:02.119
Threats?

32:02.154 --> 32:03.253
Yeah.

32:03.289 --> 32:04.655
What kind of threats?

32:04.690 --> 32:10.227
"We’re gonna Kidnap
your son and kill you."

32:10.496 --> 32:14.965
Wow, so then what?

32:15.301 --> 32:16.867
You left Baghdad?

32:16.902 --> 32:19.036
Yeah, we did leave.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.704
Where'd you go?

32:20.739 --> 32:24.241
We got onto a bus
with some of our

32:24.276 --> 32:27.711
clothes and we
just went to Syria.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.448
Out of the frying pan into the fire.

32:32.117 --> 32:35.719
Within a year of their
arrival in Syria,

32:35.754 --> 32:39.957
Marvat and Mattius faced
A new threat, ISIS.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.997
We actually Filed
applications with the

32:47.032 --> 32:50.367
United Nations and they
actually accepted us to come

32:50.402 --> 32:54.838
to the United States.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.140
Welcome to the U.S.

32:57.176 --> 32:58.875
Thank you.

32:58.911 --> 33:03.213
I want you to, for me,
to make a comparison.

33:03.248 --> 33:07.985
Your time in the hottest
part of Iraq and the hottest

33:08.020 --> 33:12.222
part of Syria,
and your life now?

33:14.159 --> 33:18.495
It's life here, freedom.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.365
Freedom of religion,

33:21.400 --> 33:24.034
it's really different to
come here, to America,

33:24.069 --> 33:28.305
I do think between the
heaven and hell and I compare

33:28.340 --> 33:31.608
it to my life.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.945
Mervan and
Mattius have joined other

33:34.980 --> 33:38.048
Assyrian refugees in
California's central valley,

33:38.083 --> 33:42.586
where they can live
and pray in peace.

33:44.857 --> 33:48.291
Mervat and Mattius have
lived through hell on earth,

33:48.327 --> 33:50.694
they were chased out of two
countries because of their

33:50.729 --> 33:55.065
faith, but, the promise of
heaven rooted in a tradition

33:55.100 --> 33:59.369
that goes back to the time of
Christ gave them the strength

33:59.405 --> 34:02.506
to find a better life,

34:02.541 --> 34:06.743
they made it to
their kingdom of heaven.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.781
Finding heaven on earth
is a goal for many faiths

34:10.815 --> 34:14.484
around the world.

34:14.520 --> 34:19.489
But in the jungles of Mexico,
the faithful dared to step

34:19.525 --> 34:22.159
into their own heaven.

34:22.194 --> 34:24.995
In an underwater graveyard.

34:32.304 --> 34:36.273
As a youngster
growing up in Mississippi,

34:36.308 --> 34:39.443
Hollywood seemed
impossibly far away.

34:39.478 --> 34:43.513
A land I only dreamed
of ever seeing.

34:43.549 --> 34:45.982
Many faithful think of
heaven the same way,

34:46.018 --> 34:49.085
an impossible realm that
you will never set foot in,

34:49.121 --> 34:51.621
in this life.

34:51.657 --> 34:57.360
Or is heaven a place where
you can come back from and

34:57.396 --> 34:59.863
tell the tale?

35:07.005 --> 35:10.373
In Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula
the ancient Maya believed they

35:10.409 --> 35:12.976
had found entry ways to
heaven through water filled,

35:13.011 --> 35:16.146
underground caverns.

35:17.449 --> 35:21.084
Called cenotes.

35:21.954 --> 35:24.387
Archaeologist and National
Geographic explorer,

35:24.423 --> 35:28.291
Giamo Dianda and his
colleague, Dante Garcia,

35:28.327 --> 35:31.094
are here to dive
at two cenotes deep in

35:31.130 --> 35:34.664
the Yucatan jungle.

35:36.101 --> 35:38.969
They are searching for
evidence that the Maya entered

35:39.004 --> 35:42.205
these cenotes to offer
human sacrifices to their

35:42.241 --> 35:45.475
god of rain, Chaac.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.147
What’s up?

35:50.182 --> 35:51.581
Good to see you again, man.

35:51.617 --> 35:53.116
Nice to see you again.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.252
Pedro Flores is a descendant of the

35:55.287 --> 35:58.488
ancient Maya people
who lived in this area.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.426
This is the cenote that I talked

36:03.462 --> 36:04.661
to you about.

36:04.696 --> 36:07.564
Oh this is great,
it's a great entrance.

36:07.599 --> 36:11.201
It’s very mystical for me,
the cenotes,

36:11.236 --> 36:16.873
with water, is the closest
doorway to underground heaven.

36:17.109 --> 36:19.843
This is the threshold
between our world,

36:19.878 --> 36:22.546
physical world, and
the spiritual world.

36:22.581 --> 36:26.683
And the world of gods
like for instance Chaac.

36:27.419 --> 36:29.586
Maya legend says the rain god,

36:29.621 --> 36:33.123
Chaac, lived in the
clouds, the heavens.

36:33.158 --> 36:36.326
But his heaven also extended
underground where Chaacs

36:36.361 --> 36:39.529
avatars scoop up water
from the cenotes with

36:39.565 --> 36:43.133
earthenware jars to make rain.

36:43.168 --> 36:46.836
Thunder is the sound of these
jars being broken open and

36:46.872 --> 36:50.840
releasing the downpour.
The rain was vital for the survival

36:50.876 --> 36:55.312
of the corn crop, and,
in turn, the Maya people.

36:55.714 --> 36:58.348
Archaeologists
believe ancient Maya

36:58.383 --> 37:01.885
would come to the cenotes and
offer human sacrifices to

37:01.920 --> 37:05.822
bring the rain.

37:11.797 --> 37:15.098
Before Giamo and Dante
Enter the cenote Pedro

37:15.133 --> 37:17.367
makes an offering to Chaac.

37:23.475 --> 37:27.077
I just asked permission you, Chaac,

37:27.112 --> 37:30.880
the father of rain,
father of water, thunders,

37:30.916 --> 37:35.051
he's the one who gonna
help us to go in safe and

37:35.087 --> 37:37.087
get back safe.

37:37.122 --> 37:40.790
Thank you.

37:41.994 --> 37:44.461
Go.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.992
Giamo and Dante dive 100 feet

38:16.028 --> 38:18.728
below the surface.

38:18.764 --> 38:21.931
They discover some carved
stones which Giamo believes

38:21.967 --> 38:27.771
could be over 1000 years old,
but no sign of human remains.

38:34.446 --> 38:37.647
Giamo hopes they will find
proof of human sacrifice at

38:37.683 --> 38:42.519
another cenote that's two
and a half miles away.

38:47.025 --> 38:51.628
So we rappel down
and suit up and make

38:51.663 --> 38:55.865
a quick look, we will forage.

38:56.034 --> 38:58.601
Access to the second cenote requires

38:58.637 --> 39:03.873
the divers to be lowered down
to the water 30 feet below.

39:16.621 --> 39:20.990
Giamo and Dante discover
some pottery, and then...

39:24.096 --> 39:29.532
the evidence of sacrifice
they've been looking for.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.402
This is the ultimate
offering you can

39:32.437 --> 39:36.272
make to gods, human blood
or a human life.

39:36.308 --> 39:40.243
So, in times of desperation,
big droughts, no rain,

39:40.278 --> 39:44.614
no agriculture, it's maybe
time to do a sacrifice and to

39:44.649 --> 39:47.984
appease the gods and to
ask for them, to beg them,

39:48.019 --> 39:51.020
to make rain.

39:51.056 --> 39:54.457
The ritual importance of
these places, cenotes and caves,

39:54.493 --> 39:57.594
they are strong, they have huge,

39:57.629 --> 40:02.365
important energies that
the Maya knew about,

40:02.401 --> 40:05.468
and these people
supposed to, sometimes,

40:05.504 --> 40:09.873
carry a message for the
gods that live there.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.377
The Maya believed cenotes were

40:14.413 --> 40:16.846
passageways to heaven,

40:16.882 --> 40:20.450
some who ventured into
those waters returned,

40:20.485 --> 40:22.852
I'm sure they
told incredible tales of

40:22.888 --> 40:26.623
what they saw.

40:29.227 --> 40:33.963
Across the world, in India,
Hindus also believe they have

40:33.999 --> 40:37.834
a passageway to an eternal
world, the Ganges river.

40:39.938 --> 40:45.341
It leads to a state of
pure energy called moksha.

40:45.744 --> 40:49.245
Hindus believe
in reincarnation,

40:49.281 --> 40:53.616
but when they reach moksha,
their version of heaven,

40:53.652 --> 40:56.419
they don't return to earth.

40:56.455 --> 40:59.956
We can't ask them any more
than we can ask the Maya what

40:59.991 --> 41:05.595
heaven is like, but, today,
thanks to modern medicine,

41:05.964 --> 41:10.066
people occasionally die
and come back to life.

41:10.101 --> 41:15.305
Perhaps they have tales
of heaven to tell us?

41:23.381 --> 41:27.016
To learn what heaven might
be like I’m going to speak

41:27.052 --> 41:31.354
to a woman who claims she
went there when she died.

41:31.590 --> 41:32.889
Would you like to come and sit?

41:32.924 --> 41:34.290
Surely.

41:34.326 --> 41:37.594
A physician's assistant
named Krista Gorman.

41:37.629 --> 41:42.131
You had a near
death experience,

41:42.634 --> 41:44.667
I'm talking to a real,

41:44.703 --> 41:47.370
live woman who had
a near death experience?

41:47.405 --> 41:50.206
Uh huh, yes you are.

41:50.242 --> 41:52.642
What led up to that?

41:52.677 --> 41:56.045
Well, I was pregnant
with my daughter and

41:56.081 --> 41:58.715
I went in a week before
she was due because she

41:58.750 --> 42:00.984
had a problem with her
kidney, not only that,

42:01.019 --> 42:05.255
but her heart rate
was dropping very low.

42:09.895 --> 42:12.862
So, they said, you know,
we need to do a C-section,

42:12.898 --> 42:16.633
and it was too
dangerous to wait.

42:21.506 --> 42:27.143
I started having trouble
breathing and I passed out.

42:38.690 --> 42:41.291
They lost my pulse
for eight minutes.

42:41.326 --> 42:43.793
Can we define that as death?

42:43.828 --> 42:47.730
In the clinical sense, perhaps.

42:47.766 --> 42:49.999
My heart stopped beating,
I wasn't getting any blood

42:50.035 --> 42:51.568
flow to my brain.

42:51.603 --> 42:55.138
Okay, so, you pass out.

42:55.307 --> 42:57.840
Then the next thing
I remember was being

42:57.876 --> 43:02.645
very far above my body.

43:04.816 --> 43:07.884
I saw the body laying there
and there were people around it,

43:07.919 --> 43:10.219
and I was still me,
I was still Krista,

43:10.255 --> 43:12.889
but I had no relationship
with anything that I

43:12.924 --> 43:15.224
was witnessing below.

43:15.260 --> 43:16.759
It’s happening but you're still

43:16.795 --> 43:18.094
not involved in it?

43:18.129 --> 43:19.896
Correct.

43:19.931 --> 43:22.031
I felt this tugging to my left,

43:22.067 --> 43:24.500
something kind of
pulled at me a little bit,

43:24.536 --> 43:27.003
as if to say, come on.

43:27.038 --> 43:30.106
And I, yes, okay, I’ll go.

43:30.141 --> 43:33.343
I just started moving.

43:33.645 --> 43:37.080
Through the wall and
into this bright white space

43:37.115 --> 43:39.349
that was just a flash.

43:39.384 --> 43:43.519
I came out into what
I called my Eden,

43:43.555 --> 43:46.623
it was a space that
was incredibly beautiful,

43:46.658 --> 43:50.760
green, rolling hills, beautiful,
blue sky, there was a deep,

43:50.795 --> 43:55.064
evergreen forest, and to my
left there was a moss covered,

43:55.100 --> 43:58.701
rock waterfall, and
it was beyond beautiful.

43:59.838 --> 44:02.171
I felt like I was at one with it and

44:02.207 --> 44:04.507
it was one with me.

44:04.542 --> 44:09.345
I was flanked on both sides
by what I refer to as my

44:09.381 --> 44:13.616
spiritual guides or what
we would call angels, here,

44:14.886 --> 44:19.122
they were very tall and thin
and almost like they were

44:19.157 --> 44:22.892
wearing drapes, and they
communicated to me that I

44:22.927 --> 44:26.529
could either stay in
that place, that Eden,

44:26.564 --> 44:30.466
I could move beyond
that to what came next,

44:30.502 --> 44:32.669
or I could come back here.

44:32.704 --> 44:36.439
And as soon as I
made that decision...

44:38.810 --> 44:41.678
I started to move backwards
very, very quickly,

44:41.713 --> 44:45.248
and they sort of turned to me
and communicated well if you

44:45.283 --> 44:50.319
choose to go back you need
to share what you learned here,

44:50.555 --> 44:53.956
and I had this feeling
of tremendous love

44:53.992 --> 44:57.860
just permeated me.

45:00.265 --> 45:01.798
Awesome.

45:01.833 --> 45:03.332
Yeah.

45:03.368 --> 45:04.934
As far as I can tell, you

45:04.969 --> 45:06.669
just described heaven.

45:06.705 --> 45:10.973
It was heaven, it was my heaven.

45:11.009 --> 45:13.342
When do you get back to the time that

45:13.378 --> 45:16.446
you know, oh, wow, okay,
I'm right back here.

45:16.481 --> 45:19.982
They were able to get
me back and awake

45:20.018 --> 45:24.387
on some level roughly
24 hours after the event,

45:24.422 --> 45:28.791
and I woke up that morning
just wanting to, you know,

45:28.827 --> 45:31.260
shout from the hilltops
what I had learned,

45:31.296 --> 45:33.963
what had happened to me.

45:33.998 --> 45:37.800
Religion, got one?

45:38.570 --> 45:41.504
My religion is love, you know...

45:41.539 --> 45:46.409
God, to me, is love.

45:46.578 --> 45:48.177
That’s what we were taught when we

45:48.213 --> 45:49.512
were three years old.

45:50.982 --> 45:54.951
God is love.

45:54.986 --> 45:56.753
And it's that simple.

45:56.788 --> 45:58.187
We are love.

45:58.223 --> 45:59.856
Now, hold on a second,

45:59.891 --> 46:05.461
you're gonna say to the entire
world it's as simple as that?

46:05.497 --> 46:07.697
For me it is.

46:07.732 --> 46:11.267
Well, I have to believe that it's

46:11.302 --> 46:15.071
as simple as that.

46:15.106 --> 46:17.073
Yeah.

46:17.108 --> 46:20.076
All of this we have discussed is

46:20.111 --> 46:24.947
around the birth or
attempted birth of a baby.

46:27.886 --> 46:29.719
Which is it?

46:29.754 --> 46:31.554
The birth of my daughter.

46:31.589 --> 46:33.289
So you have her?

46:33.324 --> 46:35.224
She is a reality?

46:35.260 --> 46:36.692
Would you like to meet her?

46:36.728 --> 46:37.994
Of course.

46:38.029 --> 46:40.763
Let’s go.

46:41.132 --> 46:42.131
Hey Maggie.

46:42.167 --> 46:43.933
Hi.

46:43.968 --> 46:45.468
There’s somebody I want you to meet.

46:45.503 --> 46:46.769
What are you doing?

46:46.805 --> 46:48.104
Nice to meet you.

46:48.139 --> 46:49.472
What?

46:49.507 --> 46:50.773
Don't I get a hug?

46:50.809 --> 46:52.074
Oh hi!

46:52.110 --> 46:54.911
Oh my goodness.

46:56.281 --> 46:59.215
Okay, alright, you know
we're here to talk to your mom

46:59.250 --> 47:01.384
about you'alls experience?

47:01.419 --> 47:02.819
Yeah.

47:02.854 --> 47:04.253
How do you feel?

47:04.289 --> 47:06.756
I was ten, 11, when
she first sat me down and

47:06.791 --> 47:09.058
talked to me about it,
and when I first heard about

47:09.093 --> 47:12.461
it I didn't really
understand it all that much.

47:12.497 --> 47:14.030
It went over my head.

47:14.065 --> 47:18.367
After that I was around 14
when I finally realized why

47:18.403 --> 47:21.270
she thinks so highly
of this experience,

47:21.306 --> 47:24.440
and I can finally
understand how to apply it

47:24.475 --> 47:25.908
to my own life.

47:25.944 --> 47:28.978
It makes sense
to me that at ten your mum

47:29.013 --> 47:32.481
explaining to you your birth,
that's about as far as you

47:32.517 --> 47:33.749
can go with it.

47:33.785 --> 47:35.318
Uh huh, yeah.

47:35.353 --> 47:37.119
Until things start to percolate

47:37.155 --> 47:38.287
Over the years.

47:38.323 --> 47:39.555
Yeah.

47:39.591 --> 47:44.794
Well Maggie, darling, I am so happy

47:44.829 --> 47:45.962
To see you.

47:45.997 --> 47:47.530
It’s such an honor.

47:47.565 --> 47:50.833
I mean, particularly
knowing mom and

47:50.869 --> 47:55.705
you and your trip together,
I am happy to see you here.

47:56.474 --> 48:00.009
Thank you so much.

48:01.746 --> 48:04.914
So many faiths have so many beliefs

48:04.949 --> 48:07.950
about heaven and hell.

48:07.986 --> 48:09.852
But Krista,

48:09.888 --> 48:14.290
like so many other survivors
of near death experiences,

48:14.325 --> 48:19.562
came back from her trip
with an overwhelming

48:19.597 --> 48:24.533
feeling of love, that's heaven.

48:26.504 --> 48:31.374
Heaven is simply love.

48:31.409 --> 48:34.610
And that's the power of
heaven and hell, I think.

48:34.812 --> 48:40.049
How they affect us emotionally
and fill us with love of our

48:40.084 --> 48:44.253
brothers and sisters and
fear that drives us away

48:44.289 --> 48:48.925
from evil and hope
for a brighter future.

48:51.095 --> 48:56.399
It drives us to make
a positive change,

48:57.535 --> 49:03.472
not in some other world
but right here on earth.

49:09.380 --> 49:13.149
My journey to understand
heaven and hell has taken me

49:13.184 --> 49:16.919
from the bowels of the
earth to the gates of Eden.

49:18.523 --> 49:22.191
From people who live in
the shadow of the inferno to

49:22.226 --> 49:26.062
those who bathe in the
light of paradise.

49:34.572 --> 49:37.640
Heaven and hell
are not just ideas.

49:37.675 --> 49:40.376
They're a part of us.

49:40.411 --> 49:43.946
A part of what we
yearn to escape.
