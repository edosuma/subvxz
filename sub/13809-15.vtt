WHEN TITO AND I WERE YOUNGER

08:20.041 --> 08:24.253
{\an5}<i>WE FOUND OUT THAT FRANKIE FUN</i>

A FAKE, TOO.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.867
I CAN'T BELIEVE I ASKED HIM
FOR HIS AUTOGRAPH

HE'S NOT ASKING
FOR AN AUTOGRAPH.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.645
{\an5}WE WERE THINKING,
SINCE YOU DON'T DO
YOUR OWN STUNTS...

09:22.728 --> 09:25.648
{\an4}MAYBE YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW HOW TO
REALLY SKATE.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.296
{\an3}WHY NOT?

12:35.379 --> 12:37.465
BECAUSE NO ONE LISTENS
TO THE SAFETY PATROL.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.259
Others:

12:40.342 --> 12:43.012
{\an5}LOOK, I DIDN'T ASK TO BE

WHAT'S WITH
THE JACKET?

13:12.958 --> 13:14.835

{\an4}MAYBE WE'VE BEEN
TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF SAMMY.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.563
WE'VE TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF SAM

15:39.647 --> 15:42.441
HUNDREDS OF TIMES, AND
HE'S NEVER RATTED ON US.

15:42.524 --> 15:43.859

RESPECT THAT.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.012
I GUESS.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.681
I GUESS I COULD LET PEOPLE OFF
WITH WARNINGS ONCE IN A WHILE.

19:42.764 --> 19:44.933
I LIKE WARNINGS.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.812
