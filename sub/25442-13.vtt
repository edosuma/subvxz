♪♪

00:03.250 --> 00:06.710
Raven's Home
was filmed in front
of a live studio audience.

00:09.420 --> 00:11.920
Booker, stop playing with your
Frankencrunch and eat.

00:11.920 --> 00:14.040
I'm not hungry.

00:14.040 --> 00:16.210
Ever since I lost
my vision power

00:16.210 --> 00:18.250
I have this emptiness inside.

00:18.250 --> 00:21.170
It's called hunger. Eat!

00:21.170 --> 00:22.790
(phone ringing)

00:25.960 --> 00:28.330
Hello?
Oh, hi Dr. Sleevemore!

00:28.330 --> 00:30.380
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:30.380 --> 00:33.170
What do you mean
you still can't find
my baby's visions?

00:33.170 --> 00:34.170
Look harder!

00:36.170 --> 00:37.380
Hey, great news!

00:37.380 --> 00:38.830
Dr. Sleevemore says

00:38.830 --> 00:41.330
he'll have your visions
by day's end.

00:41.330 --> 00:43.420
-No he didn't.
-Yes he did.

00:44.920 --> 00:46.380
Did you hear me say
day's end?

00:46.380 --> 00:48.330
Only the British
say day's end.

00:48.330 --> 00:50.250
And Dr. Sleevemore is British.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.290
So there you go,
yes he did.

00:53.120 --> 00:54.290
Now, if you'll excuse me

00:54.290 --> 00:56.500
I have to go take
the rubbish out.
(chuckling)

00:56.500 --> 00:58.380
That's the British word
for trash.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.670
Cheerio!

01:03.420 --> 01:05.250
That's British for
she lyin'.

01:06.540 --> 01:08.210
She knows I'm nothing
without my visions.

01:08.210 --> 01:10.210
Well, until your visions
come back,

01:10.210 --> 01:11.880
maybe you just need to find
a new thing

01:11.880 --> 01:13.830
to take your mind
off of the old thing.

01:13.830 --> 01:16.120
Here. Try this.

01:16.120 --> 01:18.830
It's an incredibly hard
instrument to learn.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.380
(trombone blares)

01:22.380 --> 01:24.380
Just--Just go with it.

01:24.380 --> 01:25.790
I know it's hard.

01:25.790 --> 01:29.250
(playing "When the Saints
Go Marching In" perfectly)

01:42.790 --> 01:44.380
Whoo!

01:44.380 --> 01:46.290
Nah, not for me.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.420
What do you mean
Booker's visions are gone?

01:51.420 --> 01:53.500
Like, gone gone?

01:53.500 --> 01:54.670
Gone gone.

01:54.670 --> 01:57.120
Ah man, I leave town
for one basketball tournament

01:57.120 --> 01:58.380
and I miss all the excitement.

01:58.380 --> 02:00.620
It's not exciting, Tess.

02:00.620 --> 02:01.960
He's upset.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.710
Well, at least I'm not
gonna have to see

02:03.710 --> 02:05.210
that goofy vision face again.

02:05.210 --> 02:06.580
(both laughing)

02:07.580 --> 02:08.920
(whooshing)

02:11.420 --> 02:12.580
(grunting)

02:12.580 --> 02:14.120
(whooshing)

02:16.290 --> 02:18.080
(laughing)
Yeah, that one.

02:19.920 --> 02:21.620
Tess!

02:21.620 --> 02:23.120
I think I just had a vision.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.420
A vision? Come on!

02:25.420 --> 02:28.250
No, no. I started
getting all tingly

02:28.250 --> 02:30.290
and then I saw this...
this purple light

02:30.290 --> 02:32.330
and my mom was standing
outside my window.

02:32.330 --> 02:33.880
That's never gonna happen.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.080
We're three stories up

02:35.080 --> 02:36.250
and your mom's
afraid of heights.

02:36.250 --> 02:38.290
(chuckles)
Yes.

02:38.290 --> 02:40.290
Yeah, you're totally right.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.710
But just in case.

02:44.920 --> 02:46.420
Tess:
Whoa!

02:48.120 --> 02:49.330
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey.

02:49.330 --> 02:50.420
What are you doing?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.670
Here's what happened, listen.
I was taking out
the rubbish, right?

02:55.210 --> 02:56.380
And I locked myself out.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.290
Now, I was knocking
but no one could hear me

02:58.290 --> 03:00.290
over the trombone music.

03:03.420 --> 03:04.540
Well, are you gonna come in?

03:04.540 --> 03:06.460
What? Girl, I'm not
climbing through a window.

03:06.460 --> 03:08.420
I have class, all right?

03:08.420 --> 03:10.420
I take the fire escape.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.210
Now, go open the front door
in like two minutes, okay?

03:12.210 --> 03:13.920
-Okay. All right.
-(Raven screaming)

03:14.920 --> 03:16.000
(body thuds)

03:16.000 --> 03:17.040
Raven:
I'm okay!

03:19.210 --> 03:20.460
You just had a vision!

03:20.460 --> 03:21.880
I just had a vision!

03:21.880 --> 03:22.960
What's gonna happen next?

03:22.960 --> 03:25.420
Well, um, I'm gonna
go open the door for my mom.

03:25.420 --> 03:27.000

(laughing)

04:20.420 --> 04:22.830
So, did you have
any more visions?

04:22.830 --> 04:24.210
No.

04:24.210 --> 04:27.290
But I did have a realization.

04:27.290 --> 04:28.830
Ooh, someone's been
paying attention

04:28.830 --> 04:30.750
to the word of the day.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.330
I'm serious, Tess.

04:33.330 --> 04:35.170
These aren't my visions.

04:35.170 --> 04:36.380
They're Booker's.

04:36.380 --> 04:38.460
Hey, you don't know that.

04:38.460 --> 04:41.000
Maybe you just got
your own vision power.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.920
No, there's no way.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.380
It's too big of
a coincidence that he would

04:44.380 --> 04:46.540
suddenly lose his
and I would get mine.

04:48.250 --> 04:49.380
They're definitely his.

04:49.380 --> 04:51.250
-I gotta tell him.
-Wait! Wait.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.880
You've always wondered
what it would be like

04:52.880 --> 04:54.170
to have visions.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.380
This is a gift.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.250
It'd be rude
not to accept it.

04:59.460 --> 05:00.460
I do like gifts.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.750
But they've got to go back.

05:04.750 --> 05:06.670
But how do you even know
that they can put them back?

05:06.670 --> 05:08.540
Well, they took them
out of Booker

05:08.540 --> 05:10.380
and they were gonna
put them back in Booker

05:10.380 --> 05:12.080
so I'm pretty sure
they can take them out of me

05:12.080 --> 05:13.250
and put them back in him.

05:14.710 --> 05:16.540
But you only had one vision!

05:16.540 --> 05:17.920
And it was kind of a dud.

05:19.330 --> 05:20.670
Can't you at least wait

05:20.670 --> 05:22.290
until after you have
one good one?

05:22.290 --> 05:24.540
(sighs)
I don't know, Tess. I--

05:25.790 --> 05:27.540
(whooshing)

05:27.540 --> 05:29.880
See? It's a good thing
you didn't tell Booker

05:29.880 --> 05:32.040
otherwise you wouldn't
have had that vision

05:32.040 --> 05:33.750
about today's sale
at Didi's Boutique

05:33.750 --> 05:36.210
and we wouldn't have
all this amazing stuff.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.210
(whooshing)

05:40.500 --> 05:43.170
Hey, I know that face.

05:43.170 --> 05:44.880
Now get your
birthday money, Tess.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.710
Because based on
my new vision,

05:46.710 --> 05:48.210
we've got
some shopping to do.

05:48.210 --> 05:49.290
(cheering)

05:53.880 --> 05:55.670
When did you take up baking?

05:55.670 --> 05:58.250
Right after I put down
the trombone.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.330
(timer dings)

05:59.330 --> 06:01.540
Oh, excuse me.
It's my focaccia.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.380
Yeah...

06:08.710 --> 06:11.000
This is amazing!
You're suddenly good at things

06:11.000 --> 06:12.420
we didn't even know
you could do before.

06:12.420 --> 06:13.710
Uh, yeah.

06:13.710 --> 06:16.620
Before I could
see the future.

06:16.620 --> 06:17.880
Now I can bake bread.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.620
Losing your visions
was bad.

06:22.620 --> 06:27.210
But on the upside,
this baguette is to die for.

06:29.330 --> 06:30.880
Yeah, I'm good.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.710
But I feel so bad.

06:32.710 --> 06:35.830
♪ I've never
been this low ♪

06:35.830 --> 06:38.830
♪ I've never felt
this much dread ♪

06:38.830 --> 06:43.380
♪ Without my visions
I'm just left baking bread ♪

06:43.380 --> 06:48.960
♪ I got those
visionless blues ♪

06:52.420 --> 06:54.210
Yes, I'm also
a blue's singer now.

06:56.540 --> 06:58.380
It probably has something to do
with your visions.

06:58.380 --> 07:00.170
Like when someone
loses one sense

07:00.170 --> 07:01.620
and others
get stronger.

07:01.620 --> 07:03.790
I smell bread
and the blues.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.380
Who's baking bread?

07:07.380 --> 07:10.580
Booker.
And it's amazing.

07:10.580 --> 07:11.790
(chuckles)
Come on, now.

07:11.790 --> 07:12.880
Booker's never baked bread.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.290
How do you know
it's good?

07:14.290 --> 07:16.380
Sweet Michel B. Jordan
that's good.

07:19.250 --> 07:20.420
Forget the bread.

07:20.420 --> 07:21.500
I can't forget
the bread, baby.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.210
Did Dr. Sleevemore call yet?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.080
Huh? Uh, no.
I'm sorry. No.

07:25.080 --> 07:27.250
This is amazing.

07:27.250 --> 07:30.040
You know, I got a bad
feeling about that guy.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.830
What if he took my visions

07:31.830 --> 07:33.670
and used them
for one of his weird
science experiments?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.380
No, I've known that man
for a long time.

07:35.380 --> 07:36.460
He's not stealing
your vision.

07:36.460 --> 07:39.330
Ooh!
What you--?

07:39.330 --> 07:41.040
Mama, put the bread down!

07:41.040 --> 07:43.000
I can't put
the bread down, baby.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.290
-Put the bread down!
-I can't put it down!

07:44.290 --> 07:47.420
All right, a shopping vision
was a good start.

07:47.420 --> 07:48.920
Now what else
you got in there?

07:48.920 --> 07:50.580
Answers to math tests?

07:50.580 --> 07:52.710
-Lottery numbers?
-Tess...

07:52.710 --> 07:55.000
You know I have to
give these visions
back to Booker.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.380
Come on!

07:56.380 --> 07:58.210
Even Didi's lets you
keep something
for two weeks

07:58.210 --> 07:59.460
before you have
to return it.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.330
That is true.

08:05.330 --> 08:07.420
Okay, fine.
Two weeks it is.

08:07.420 --> 08:10.330
But, I don't want anybody
seeing my vision face.

08:10.330 --> 08:12.290
So, just to be safe.

08:12.290 --> 08:15.290
Look at you.
Sneaky and stylish.

08:15.290 --> 08:18.290
I went from psychic
to psy-chic.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.170
-Rae!
-Levi, give--

08:21.170 --> 08:22.250
Nia, Nia!
Get over here quick.

08:22.250 --> 08:23.920
Your brother baked
some delicious bread.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.250
-Oh, you want me to try it?
-No, I want you
to hold Levi down.

08:29.250 --> 08:30.920
Why are you wearing
sunglasses inside?

08:30.920 --> 08:32.250
I think you're
hiding your eyes

08:32.250 --> 08:33.790
because Booker's visions
flew into them

08:33.790 --> 08:36.000
and you don't want Booker
to see when you have
vision face.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.250
-All: What?
-Nia: No!

08:37.250 --> 08:39.920
Ha! Made you let go!
Made you let go!

08:42.290 --> 08:44.960
(chuckles)
You know that Levi,

08:44.960 --> 08:47.420
always coming up
with the craziest ideas

08:47.420 --> 08:49.420
to win his
bread tug-of-war.

08:51.290 --> 08:52.880
Look, I gotta go.
I'll see you later.

09:00.000 --> 09:03.750
I'm in tremendous pain
but it was worth it.

09:08.670 --> 09:11.040
Sweetheart, Booker will be back
from the store soon

09:11.040 --> 09:12.420
with something
to settle your stomach.

09:12.420 --> 09:14.540
In the meantime, here,
have some tea.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.540
But Auntie Rae,
my mom always rubs

09:16.540 --> 09:18.460
my tummy when it hurts.

09:19.670 --> 09:22.420
Oh, well sweetheart,
your momma somehow

09:22.420 --> 09:25.420
found the money to go to Vegas
with her college friends.

09:25.420 --> 09:28.040
So I guess you're gonna be
rubbing your tummy by yourself.

09:31.290 --> 09:32.330
(whooshing)

09:34.250 --> 09:36.670
Now that I know
where Booker's powers are

09:36.670 --> 09:38.210
I'm going to take them.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.670
(whooshing)

09:42.040 --> 09:44.330
(gasps)
Levi, I just had a vision.

09:44.330 --> 09:47.460
Was it of me giving birth
to a bread baby?

09:48.750 --> 09:50.540
No, no.
Booker was right.

09:50.540 --> 09:52.330
Sleevemore is after his visions.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.000
What are we gonna do?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.380
I mean, we gotta
find a way

09:55.380 --> 09:57.380
to infiltrate
the Sleevemore Center,

09:57.380 --> 09:59.420
so that we can figure out
his plans and stop him.

09:59.420 --> 10:02.620
I don't know, Auntie Rae,
breaking in there sounds wrong.

10:02.620 --> 10:05.580
Breaking in? Who said anything
about breaking in, Levi??

10:05.580 --> 10:08.040
I mean, all we're gonna do
is just you know,

10:08.040 --> 10:09.460
make a casual visit
to the center

10:09.460 --> 10:11.080
while no one is there.

10:12.540 --> 10:14.620
But people are always there.

10:14.620 --> 10:18.670
(gasps)
Not if we invite
Dr. Sleevemore and the kids

10:18.670 --> 10:21.420
to a rooftop party tonight.

10:21.420 --> 10:24.330
I'm gonna miss
a rooftop party?

10:24.330 --> 10:27.040
Now I'm definitely
not breaking in with you.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.620
Really, Levi. What is this
breaking in thing

10:30.620 --> 10:32.540
you keep talking about?

10:32.540 --> 10:35.330
(giggling)
I mean, is it
really a crime

10:35.330 --> 10:37.290
for a mother to want to
protect her kids?

10:38.290 --> 10:39.330
Yes!

10:40.670 --> 10:42.540
The correct answer
is no. All right?

10:42.540 --> 10:44.290
Now, we're not
gonna tell Booker.

10:44.290 --> 10:45.620
I don't want to get
his hopes up.

10:45.620 --> 10:48.540
Okay, fine.

10:48.540 --> 10:51.080
But I don't know
if I can go in my condition.

10:51.080 --> 10:53.330
(farting)

10:59.750 --> 11:01.250
Ya nasty.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.420
Wow, it looks even better
at home than it did at Didi's.

11:11.420 --> 11:13.250
I know.
I love it!

11:14.670 --> 11:16.120
(whooshing)

11:21.420 --> 11:22.710
(whooshing)

11:25.210 --> 11:26.960
There's my favorite face.

11:28.580 --> 11:29.620
So, what do you got?

11:29.620 --> 11:32.290
You remember that cute boy
from the center
I was telling you about?

11:32.290 --> 11:34.380
Yeah, Miles.
With the bouncy 'fro?

11:34.380 --> 11:35.750
I just had a vision
that he and I

11:35.750 --> 11:37.330
were at a party
on the roof.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.210
I was wearing this dress,

11:38.210 --> 11:40.750
and he was holding my hand.

11:40.750 --> 11:43.290
(both screaming
and giggling)

11:43.290 --> 11:44.500
So, what do you
need to do

11:44.500 --> 11:46.040
to make this hand-holding
thing happen?

11:46.040 --> 11:48.210
Well, I just have to go
to a party on the roof,

11:48.210 --> 11:50.920
wear this dress,
and have a hold-able hand.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.460
But what party on the roof?

11:53.830 --> 11:55.880
Whoo! Mama's throwing
a party on the roof.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.290
Heeey!

11:59.460 --> 12:02.380
That one.
That party on the roof.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.830
Welcome, everyone
from the Sleevemore Center.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.330
I am so happy
you all could make it.

12:12.330 --> 12:14.120
You all made it, right?
Everybody's accounted for?

12:16.250 --> 12:19.380
Good to know. Just making sure
no one's left out.

12:19.380 --> 12:23.210
Okay, please enjoy the bread,
the cheese, and the DJ.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.250
We don't have a DJ.
Or cheese.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.710
Enjoy the bread!

12:30.830 --> 12:33.330
Pick a card, any card.

12:35.170 --> 12:36.710
And apparently,
a magician.

12:38.830 --> 12:39.920
Look at Sleevemore over there.

12:41.830 --> 12:43.330
Vision stealer.

12:43.330 --> 12:46.000
Smiling that fake smile.
I hate phony people.

12:47.330 --> 12:49.580
Oh, hey! Hello!

12:49.580 --> 12:51.670
Muah! Muah! Kisses.

12:51.670 --> 12:53.380
So good to see you.

12:53.380 --> 12:55.580
You too, my dear.
And I must thank you.

12:55.580 --> 12:58.000
This party was
a wonderful idea.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.120
-I wore my dancing shoes.
-Did ya?

13:02.620 --> 13:05.710
Um, speaking of dancing,
we need to dance out of here

13:05.710 --> 13:07.250
'cause we got to go get a...

13:07.250 --> 13:08.330
(both stammering)

13:08.330 --> 13:11.330
Get a a rabbit for Booker
to pull out of a hat.

13:11.330 --> 13:12.790
Ta-da!

13:14.920 --> 13:17.620
Did I say rabbit?
I meant rabbi.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.460
It's a very nice trick.
Bye!

13:24.120 --> 13:26.580
There he is.
He's so cute.

13:26.580 --> 13:29.250
Every time he laughs
his 'fro bounces a little.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.920
It's like a laugh-'fro.

13:41.710 --> 13:43.460
(dramatic music playing)

13:45.330 --> 13:46.920
Come on, Levi.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.210
What are you doing?

13:56.210 --> 13:58.790
I'm tiptoeing so my feet
don't make a sound.

13:58.790 --> 14:01.080
You're like a feather
in high-tops, all right?

14:01.080 --> 14:02.420
Sneak like a normal person.

14:05.420 --> 14:07.170
What exactly are we
looking for?

14:07.170 --> 14:09.250
Anything that proves
Sleevemore has plans

14:09.250 --> 14:11.210
to get his hands
on my baby's visions.

14:19.420 --> 14:21.750
Seriously, Booker.
This bread is amazing.

14:21.750 --> 14:24.580
You like my bread?
You should try my sushi.

14:26.460 --> 14:27.790
Dragon roll?

14:28.880 --> 14:30.380
-Ooh!
-Amazing!

14:30.380 --> 14:32.380
Itadakimas.

14:33.210 --> 14:34.790
Arigato, Booker-san.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.750
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:43.000 --> 14:44.960
-Cool party.
-Yeah, yeah.

14:51.170 --> 14:52.460
Oh, why don't you
take the lemon bar.

14:52.460 --> 14:54.670
No, no. I'll just pick
another one.

14:54.670 --> 14:56.920
I mean, I gotta boogie.

15:00.420 --> 15:01.540
What are you doing?

15:01.540 --> 15:03.960
He is a nose picker.

15:06.210 --> 15:07.790
Or he just has an itch.

15:11.670 --> 15:13.750
-Oh, oh yeah.
-Now get back over there.

15:13.750 --> 15:15.290
Make that vision come true.

15:17.710 --> 15:19.620
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:19.620 --> 15:22.790
-Cool party.
-Yeah. Why'd you run off?

15:25.330 --> 15:28.380
Funny story. I thought you
were picking your nose.

15:28.380 --> 15:31.250
I mean, from my angle,
you were all up in there

15:31.250 --> 15:33.460
and when I say deep,
I mean brain deep.

15:33.460 --> 15:35.210
You were like...
(chuckles nervously)

15:37.290 --> 15:38.500
Oh, okay.

15:38.500 --> 15:43.080
Anyway, now that I know
you're not a booger picker,

15:43.080 --> 15:44.290
where were we?

15:45.210 --> 15:48.790
Look, um...I'm not--
I'm not comfortable

15:48.790 --> 15:51.170
talking to girls
without psychic abilities.

15:52.170 --> 15:53.290
So, bye.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.380
What happened?

15:58.080 --> 15:59.710
I don't think my vision's
gonna come true.

16:03.960 --> 16:05.420
Sure you don't
want me to type?

16:05.420 --> 16:07.040
No, I'm good, sweetie.

16:12.250 --> 16:13.880
You know you have
eight other fingers.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.620
I know. But these two
don't make mistakes.

16:20.290 --> 16:21.420
Oh, for crying out loud!

16:21.420 --> 16:22.920
-You'll never get in there
any fa--
-In.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.500
Auntie Rae, there's a file
on you in here.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.500
Raven:
Oh, let me see that.

16:31.500 --> 16:32.880
Yep, that's me.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.670
"Never gets visions right."

16:36.670 --> 16:38.540
Yep, still me.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.250
Whoa. I think I found
something on Sleevemore.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.170
Oh no. This is worse
than I thought.

16:56.040 --> 16:57.500
So, what did he say?

16:57.500 --> 17:01.290
He said he only feels
comfortable with girls
with psychic abilities.

17:01.290 --> 17:02.790
That's great!

17:02.790 --> 17:04.540
You're a girl
with psychic abilities.

17:04.540 --> 17:06.120
No, I'm not Tess.

17:06.120 --> 17:08.330
I'm a girl who's borrowing
psychic abilities.

17:08.330 --> 17:09.500
And right now,
I don't even know

17:09.500 --> 17:10.790
what good they're doing me.

17:10.790 --> 17:13.330
My vision said that he was gonna
hold my hand and...

17:14.710 --> 17:15.920
He doesn't even like me.

17:15.920 --> 17:19.500
And on top of that, she thought
I was picking my nose.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.580
Really? How embarrassing.

17:22.580 --> 17:24.960
Was it anything like this?

17:26.330 --> 17:29.290
Stop. Seriously. Stop.

17:29.290 --> 17:31.120
Stop levitating my hand!

17:33.330 --> 17:34.580
Could this party
get any weirder?

17:37.210 --> 17:38.330
(Booker singing opera)

17:48.540 --> 17:50.790
And to think
I almost said no.

17:50.790 --> 17:52.710
(singing continues)

17:54.250 --> 17:56.420
Here he comes.
Third time's the charm.

17:59.380 --> 18:01.380
-Hey.
-Hey.

18:01.380 --> 18:04.670
Look, I wasn't being
completely honest before.

18:04.670 --> 18:07.000
I'm not uncomfortable around you
'cause you're not psychic.

18:09.080 --> 18:13.710
I'm uncomfortable around you
because I like you.

18:13.710 --> 18:15.380
(energy surging)

18:15.380 --> 18:16.580
Leslie, please quit it.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.000
So, you really like me?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.080
Uh, yeah. I do.

18:26.170 --> 18:27.210
(whooshing)

18:28.960 --> 18:31.040
(electricity crackling)

18:31.040 --> 18:32.290
(whooshing)

18:36.960 --> 18:38.040
You okay?

18:38.040 --> 18:40.420
Yeah, I'm totally fine.

18:40.420 --> 18:42.290
Anyway, sorry
I was acting weird.

18:42.290 --> 18:44.000
I was just afraid I'd say
something stupid

18:44.000 --> 18:45.330
that'd make you run away.

18:45.330 --> 18:47.540
Well, that'd never happen.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.460
I'd never run away
from you so...

18:54.380 --> 18:56.120
(singing continues)

18:58.330 --> 19:00.500
(sustains note)

19:00.500 --> 19:02.500
Oh, no! Not again.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.750
Don't touch anything metal.

19:04.750 --> 19:06.460
(electricity surging)

19:09.380 --> 19:10.420
Gotta go!

19:11.620 --> 19:13.750
-(Booker screaming)
-(pot shattering)

19:15.080 --> 19:16.210
You guys okay?

19:16.210 --> 19:18.380
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.
We're fine.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.290
Thanks, Nia.

19:21.290 --> 19:24.790
But how did you know
that plant was gonna fall on me?

19:24.790 --> 19:28.000
You know, it was my...
My twintuition.

19:30.540 --> 19:32.210
I knew you were
gonna be in danger.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.380
Oh, well. I must have
twintuition too

19:36.380 --> 19:38.750
'cause I usually know
when you're lying.

19:39.750 --> 19:41.420
Like right now.

19:45.210 --> 19:46.540
Okay, fine.

19:48.580 --> 19:50.210
I've been getting visions.

19:50.210 --> 19:51.710
What?

19:52.920 --> 19:55.210
Ever since that beaker broke
at the Sleevemore Center.

19:55.210 --> 19:56.790
I don't know,
I guess your psychic power

19:56.790 --> 19:58.290
must have gone into me.

19:58.290 --> 19:59.380
I'm sorry.

20:01.790 --> 20:04.290
Yes! (laughs)

20:04.290 --> 20:05.830
Yes!

20:05.830 --> 20:07.790
Booker.
You're not mad?

20:07.790 --> 20:09.920
Of course I'm mad!

20:09.920 --> 20:12.120
Girl, I'm furious.

20:13.540 --> 20:16.420
But this means
my visions aren't lost.

20:16.420 --> 20:19.620
-You just stole them!
-I didn't steal them.

20:19.620 --> 20:21.710
I just wanted
to see how it felt

20:21.710 --> 20:23.880
to be like you and Mom
for a little while.

20:25.540 --> 20:28.290
I get that.
Pretty cool, right?

20:28.290 --> 20:30.790
Yeah, really, really cool.

20:30.790 --> 20:34.170
But, they're yours.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.330
You should have them back.

20:36.330 --> 20:37.830
Thanks.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.540
Both:
Awww.

20:41.540 --> 20:42.790
So let me get this straight,

20:44.210 --> 20:45.710
Booker's visions
ended up in Nia.

20:45.710 --> 20:48.710
This proves me theory
that psychic transmosis
is possible.

20:48.710 --> 20:50.920
Well, it certainly makes
my job a lot easier.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.790
Sleevemore! Freeze!

20:52.790 --> 20:54.380
What'd I do?

20:54.380 --> 20:57.000
Not you, the little
tiny hand one, Sleeveless.

20:57.000 --> 20:59.250
Me? What did I do?

20:59.250 --> 21:00.380
I'll tell you what you did.

21:00.380 --> 21:03.420
You invented a machine
to extract my baby's visions.

21:03.420 --> 21:06.080
Why? Because you are
the only normal one

21:06.080 --> 21:07.540
in a family full of psychics

21:07.540 --> 21:09.290
and you wanted a taste.
Admit it!

21:10.580 --> 21:13.000
You sucked
my baby's visions out

21:13.000 --> 21:15.000
and bottled 'em up
for yourself.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.750
Mom, Jasmine doesn't have
Booker's visions, I do.

21:19.750 --> 21:21.170
I'm sorry,
roll that back now.

21:23.420 --> 21:24.620
It's true.

21:24.620 --> 21:26.960
Ever since that beaker broke
I've been getting visions.

21:28.210 --> 21:29.290
Really?

21:31.080 --> 21:32.120
My bad.

21:34.380 --> 21:35.960
But this is good news, Raven.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.250
Now that I know
where Booker's powers are,

21:38.250 --> 21:39.330
I'm going to take them.

21:41.380 --> 21:44.210
And keep them safe until we can
get them back in Booker.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.580
Levi, that was my vision.
Except for the sushi part

21:48.580 --> 21:50.670
and the part where
he's gonna keep them safe.

21:50.670 --> 21:52.000
I didn't get it right again.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.250
Yep, that's you.

21:55.540 --> 21:56.960
Wait, Nia.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.710
You had visions in you
this whole entire time

21:58.710 --> 21:59.920
and didn't tell anybody?

22:01.250 --> 22:03.170
-They're pretty cool, huh?
-The coolest!

22:03.170 --> 22:04.330
(both giggling)

22:04.330 --> 22:06.670
Yeah, yeah.
They're cool.

22:06.670 --> 22:10.120
So, can you put
my visions back in me?

22:10.120 --> 22:12.790
Yes, I can use
the ocular extraction goggles

22:12.790 --> 22:15.540
to reverse the process
first thing in the morning
if you want.

22:15.540 --> 22:17.330
Yeah, that will be great.
Thanks.

22:18.620 --> 22:21.380
This is why
I invented my machine.

22:21.380 --> 22:23.170
Not to do evil.

22:23.170 --> 22:24.620
But to do good.

22:26.420 --> 22:28.210
I said "my bad."
What else does she want?

22:39.380 --> 22:41.210
(suspenseful music)

22:52.250 --> 22:53.880
(goggles whirring)

22:55.920 --> 22:58.120
The visions are finally mine.
