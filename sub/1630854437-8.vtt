16:22.637 --> 16:26.262
- We leased some ground
in the panhandle of Texas.

16:26.362 --> 16:27.543
What's that like?

16:27.643 --> 16:29.826
Windy and dry.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.642

I think sometimes

God gives us tragedies
so we can pass along

17:08.690 --> 17:12.955
how we survived it to the

17:16.859 --> 17:18.401

that knowledge leads to

17:18.501 --> 17:20.504
no tragedies at all.

17:22.706 --> 17:24.528
- What a world
that would be, huh?

17:24.628 --> 17:27.171
Yeah. What a world indeed.

18:58.696 --> 19:01.680

Travis said he's got one.

19:01.780 --> 19:04.202

doing that now. I promise.

informed is forthcoming.

23:19.354 --> 23:21.857
By doubling taxes

23:28.205 --> 23:32.570
our state's single biggest
generator of revenue: tourism.

23:33.891 --> 23:37.916
These are callous,
calculated actions

23:38.016 --> 23:41.320
that are only in the best
interest of the governor himself

23:41.420 --> 23:44.083
and will have
devastating consequences

23:47.387 --> 23:49.990

23:57.959 --> 24:01.062
seems that's all
ever talk about.

24:01.162 --> 24:03.065
But I never talk about what
the word actually means--

24:03.165 --> 24:07.870
it means "to proceed,"
"to move forward," that's all.

24:07.970 --> 24:10.673
Typically we interpret moving
forward as better--

24:10.773 --> 24:13.316
better for us as a people,
better for the planet,

24:13.416 --> 24:16.480
which is usually better
for us as a people.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.203
And if we use it
in that manner

24:19.303 --> 24:21.366
I agree.

24:21.466 --> 24:24.489
But when something benefits one
group over another group

24:24.589 --> 24:26.491
you can't use that word anymore.

24:26.591 --> 24:28.534
You must use another word.
You must use "bias,"

24:28.634 --> 24:31.657
you must use "favouritism."

24:31.757 --> 24:34.741
Running a pipeline beneath
the drinking water

24:34.841 --> 24:37.504
of an already strained
and impoverished community

24:37.604 --> 24:39.787
may be progress for the owners
of the pipeline

24:39.887 --> 24:42.430
or owners of whatever
runs through the pipeline

24:42.530 --> 24:44.072
or for those receiving it

24:44.172 --> 24:46.274
but it could lead
to disastrous effects

24:46.374 --> 24:51.240
to the land and the people
this pipeline runs beneath.

24:51.340 --> 24:53.843
Which is not progress at all.

24:53.943 --> 24:56.526
And it is for those people,

24:56.626 --> 24:58.248

future of Montana...

as governor of Montana,

He talks about litigation

damages to consider.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.332
His entire impeachment claim
is conjecture.

you need to get started.

so much that

28:34.956 --> 28:36.698
I see in him exactly
what you see?

28:36.798 --> 28:39.621
- I have no desire
to suck my father's face.

28:39.721 --> 28:40.662
You know what I mean.

28:40.762 --> 28:43.185
Where's your dad live, huh?

28:43.285 --> 28:45.868
I'll go fuck him.

28:45.968 --> 28:47.350
Don't touch my Tito's.

28:47.450 --> 28:49.112
I drink Scotch.

28:49.212 --> 28:50.834
- Course you do, with your
hairy fucking armpits.

28:50.934 --> 28:53.197
Oh, and let's get
one thing clear:

28:53.297 --> 28:55.600
you touch
my peanut M&Ms in the freezer.

28:55.700 --> 28:57.161
I will kill you
in your sleep.

28:57.261 --> 28:59.864
- I sleep with a knife.
And I have a peanut allergy.

29:01.706 --> 29:04.450
- You know, we might make
it through this.

29:04.550 --> 29:05.451
If you're done insulting me

29:05.551 --> 29:07.553
I have something
I need to show you.

29:08.474 --> 29:09.135
Come here.

29:09.235 --> 29:10.497
[typing]

29:10.597 --> 29:13.340

29:13.440 --> 29:15.542
<i>And it is for those people,</i>

29:15.642 --> 29:18.306

29:18.406 --> 29:20.668

30:41.581 --> 30:44.164
So, branding's all over, huh?

30:44.264 --> 30:45.926
You pulling out?

30:46.026 --> 30:48.168
- My family pulled
about an hour ago.

30:48.268 --> 30:50.051
You were working and
I didn't want to interrupt,

30:50.151 --> 30:52.413
but I wanted to
say goodbye, and...

30:52.513 --> 30:55.076
I don't know, maybe
we could go and, I dunno...

30:57.319 --> 30:59.541
- If your family's gone
how are you gonna get home?

30:59.641 --> 31:01.223
I have my truck here.

31:01.323 --> 31:03.266
- You can drive?
- Of course.

31:03.366 --> 31:05.148
How old do you think I am?

31:05.248 --> 31:06.870
Wait...
How old are you?

31:06.970 --> 31:08.111
- No, I didn't mean, like,
'can you drive'

31:08.211 --> 31:10.154
of course you can drive,
it's just...

31:10.254 --> 31:13.257
I don't have truck,
just a dumb cowboy.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.601
What time you done working?

31:16.701 --> 31:18.323
- You don't have
school tomorrow?

31:18.423 --> 31:20.405
- It's summer.
Nobody has school tomorrow.

31:20.505 --> 31:21.687
Right.

31:21.787 --> 31:23.369
You're done with school?

31:23.469 --> 31:26.032
- I mean, uh... it's more
like school's done with me.

31:29.315 --> 31:31.758
- Well, I can wait for you,
if you want me to.

31:34.281 --> 31:36.283
I'd like that.

31:38.846 --> 31:40.628
That's a lot to unsaddle.

31:40.728 --> 31:41.630
You want a hand?

31:41.730 --> 31:43.632
I ain't too proud to say no.

31:43.732 --> 31:45.734
- Okay.
- Come on.

31:47.616 --> 31:49.619
Grab that one.

31:54.024 --> 31:55.726
I got two pots of coffee on.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.368
Grab your mugs
and get 'em filled.

31:57.468 --> 31:59.730
- It's not cold
in Texas, is it?

31:59.830 --> 32:01.212
You think it's cold here?

32:01.312 --> 32:04.296
You gonna freeze the fuzz of
them little peaches down there.

32:04.396 --> 32:06.138
- Coldest I ever been
is prowling heifers

32:06.238 --> 32:07.619
on the Pitchfork in January.

32:07.719 --> 32:10.783
- Pack everything you got.
Your long Johns, your jackets.

32:10.883 --> 32:13.186
There ain't no trees to break
the wind where we're going.

32:13.286 --> 32:15.188
- And you won't call a
twenty-mile-an hour wind

32:15.288 --> 32:17.391
a wind after a winter
down there, guys.

32:17.491 --> 32:19.753
- Better than here.
They're damn near to Mexico.

32:19.853 --> 32:20.734
- It's colder than
a mother-in-law's heart

32:20.814 --> 32:21.635
down there, boys.

32:21.735 --> 32:23.478
- I'm telling you.
- Just pack it.

32:23.578 --> 32:25.200
It's better it lives in the
truck than not to have
it at all.

32:25.300 --> 32:26.201
You gonna miss me?

32:26.301 --> 32:27.462
- I don't know
how to answer that considering

32:27.542 --> 32:29.484
I was forced into
this relationship.

32:29.584 --> 32:31.407
- If you love something,
Teeter, set it free.

32:31.507 --> 32:32.408
I mean fuck that.

32:32.508 --> 32:33.849
He lucky I ain't
chaining his ass

32:33.949 --> 32:35.091
to the fucking radiator.

32:35.191 --> 32:36.292
- I don't know if going
back to Texas

32:36.392 --> 32:38.535
is gonna be the best thing
for her speech therapy.

32:38.635 --> 32:39.936
[laughs]

32:40.036 --> 32:41.738
- There it is, a zinger
from the cheap seats.

32:41.838 --> 32:43.340
- Rip: Shit, Ethan, I've known
you ten years,

32:43.440 --> 32:44.862
and you finally said something
half-funny.

32:44.962 --> 32:45.943
That was pretty fucking funny.

32:46.043 --> 32:47.265
- You get all
them dresses packed?

32:47.365 --> 32:48.987
Don't start that fucking shit.

32:49.087 --> 32:49.988
- They all gonna
fit in there?

32:50.088 --> 32:51.389
Don't fucking start it.

32:51.489 --> 32:52.711
- He's got 'em in a hanging
bag in the trailer.

32:52.811 --> 32:54.813
[laughing]

32:55.935 --> 32:57.276
- All right, y'all,
let's roll.

32:57.376 --> 33:01.801
[music playing]

33:01.901 --> 33:03.684
Rip: Lloyd.

33:03.784 --> 33:05.245
- I got it
handled here, brother.

33:05.345 --> 33:06.407
I know you do.

33:06.507 --> 33:06.867
You need anything,
you let me know.

33:06.947 --> 33:08.949
You, too man.

33:12.233 --> 33:14.236
Adios, boys.

33:14.596 --> 33:16.658
See you, guys.

33:16.758 --> 33:18.020
[shuffling cards]

33:18.120 --> 33:19.341
Ethan: Play a little hold em?

33:19.441 --> 33:21.224
Lloyd: Hell, ain't got
nothin' better to do.

33:21.324 --> 33:23.326
[door shuts]

33:24.047 --> 33:26.049
[music]

33:44.951 --> 33:46.953
- I'll fly out
and see you in a week.

33:53.601 --> 33:55.603
I love you.

34:00.128 --> 34:02.331
[music]

34:04.853 --> 34:06.856
- See you in Texas.
- See you on Texas.

34:11.381 --> 34:13.383
Teeter.

34:25.437 --> 34:28.841
- [whispers]
I... love... you.

34:37.090 --> 34:39.093
[engine starts]

34:53.589 --> 34:58.235
[music]

35:33.795 --> 35:37.740
- It was the perfect speech,
it was the perfect delivery.

35:37.840 --> 35:40.063
Everything about it
was perfect.

35:40.163 --> 35:42.165
- And you got the votes.
- [laughs]

35:44.167 --> 35:46.169
He's gonna fight.

35:47.571 --> 35:49.573
I don't doubt it.

35:50.174 --> 35:52.036
[doorbell rings]

35:52.136 --> 35:54.339
[pounding]

35:59.305 --> 36:01.207
Oh, shit. It's my sister.

36:01.307 --> 36:03.129
- Just ignore her.
She'll go away.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.231
You don't know my sister.

36:06.753 --> 36:08.936
See?

36:09.036 --> 36:10.457
[glass shatters]

36:10.557 --> 36:12.560
Shit. Jesus.

36:19.127 --> 36:20.989
- Jamie?
- There's a term for this, Beth.

36:21.089 --> 36:22.832
It's called
breaking and entering.

36:22.932 --> 36:25.194
- There's a term for
the reason I'm doing it:

36:25.294 --> 36:28.518
it's called career suicide,
and you fucking just did it.

36:28.618 --> 36:30.080
Get the fuck out of my house!

36:30.180 --> 36:31.762
Get the fuck out of my house!
Out of my house!

36:31.862 --> 36:33.864
- Get out!
- Fuck you, Jamie!

36:34.305 --> 36:37.268
[groans]

36:38.670 --> 36:42.014
- Tomorrow, you will
call a press conference

36:42.114 --> 36:44.416
and you will resign from office.

36:44.516 --> 36:46.178
Do you fucking
understand me, Jamie?

36:46.278 --> 36:47.940
You will resign

36:48.040 --> 36:50.803
or I'm printing photos
for the sheriff.

36:52.686 --> 36:54.908
No, you're not.

36:55.008 --> 36:58.793
- Doubt me.
Doubt me, Jamie.

36:58.893 --> 37:00.895
I am begging you.

37:01.616 --> 37:05.641
[sniffs]

37:05.741 --> 37:08.764
How many <i>bodies</i>

37:08.864 --> 37:12.048
has your father put
in the same spot?

37:12.148 --> 37:14.971
Turn me in and you turn him in.

37:15.071 --> 37:17.074
Have you
thought this through?

37:18.155 --> 37:20.618
[laughs]

37:20.718 --> 37:22.940
Wait, did you even know?

37:23.040 --> 37:25.263
Did you think I
just picked a turnout

37:25.363 --> 37:28.787
on the Wyoming border
at fucking random?!

37:28.887 --> 37:31.110
There's a century's worth
of our family's secrets

37:31.210 --> 37:33.673
down at the bottom
of that canyon.

37:33.773 --> 37:36.396
You want to see how fast they
take the ranch from us then?

37:36.496 --> 37:38.638
It'll straighten your fucking
hair, that's how fast.

37:38.738 --> 37:40.120
Bullshit.

37:40.220 --> 37:43.364
- Ask him. Ask your husband.
where the train station is,

37:43.464 --> 37:45.526
and how many times
he's been there.

37:45.626 --> 37:49.471
You want to know the real price
for protecting the ranch?

37:52.714 --> 37:55.337
I don't think you do.

37:55.437 --> 37:58.861
If the goal is protecting the
ranch from future generations

37:58.961 --> 38:00.704
of which you have none,

38:00.804 --> 38:03.307
then monetising the ranch
is the only option.

38:03.407 --> 38:06.170
The airport was the only option
and you fucking know it!

38:07.331 --> 38:08.553
You're a business woman.

38:08.653 --> 38:09.914
How's the cattle business
treating you, Beth?

38:10.014 --> 38:11.676
You see any long
term plays there?

38:11.776 --> 38:14.119
You know all of this!

38:14.219 --> 38:16.221
And you can't convince him.

38:17.383 --> 38:21.167
Well, I am guaranteeing the
ranch is passed down to Tate,

38:21.267 --> 38:22.368
to my son.

38:22.468 --> 38:25.412
To their children some day.

38:25.512 --> 38:27.254
That is the promise
that I made,

38:27.354 --> 38:29.657
and that is the promise
I'm gonna keep.

38:29.757 --> 38:34.062
The greatest threat
to that ranch is our father.

38:34.162 --> 38:36.665
And you know that, too.

38:36.765 --> 38:40.029
So <i>I</i> will remove the threat.

38:40.129 --> 38:42.131
[floor creaks]

38:42.852 --> 38:47.557
[music]

38:47.657 --> 38:49.239
- You'll take your
approval anywhere

38:49.339 --> 38:51.341
you can find it,
won't you, Jamie?

38:55.867 --> 38:57.869
I bet you are one
expensive hooker.

38:59.991 --> 39:01.994
You enjoying your marionette?

39:04.877 --> 39:06.879
Every inch of him.

39:09.442 --> 39:11.925
- Okay.
So, it's war.

39:13.287 --> 39:15.289
The War's over, Beth.

39:17.892 --> 39:19.894
No, Jamie.

39:21.936 --> 39:23.939
War is just beginning.

39:31.588 --> 39:33.750
[music]

39:53.533 --> 39:54.914
<i>And this just in.</i>

39:55.014 --> 39:56.997
<i>Wolf Watch, the environmental</i>
<i>group that funds</i>

39:57.097 --> 39:59.039
<i>the radio collar studies</i>
<i>of wolf packs in the park</i>

39:59.139 --> 40:01.842
<i>has just issued a press</i>
<i>release claiming that they</i>

<i>on Governor John Dutton's</i>
<i>Yellowstone Ranch,</i>

40:12.314 --> 40:15.578
<i>So far, no comment from</i>
<i>the Governor's Office.</i>

40:15.678 --> 40:17.300
- When it rains
it pours, huh?

40:17.400 --> 40:19.182
- They never reached
out for comment.

40:19.282 --> 40:21.385
And nothing indicated they
were killed on your ranch.

40:21.485 --> 40:23.747
I mean, this is, this is...

40:23.847 --> 40:26.230
It's a hit piece, Clara.

40:26.330 --> 40:27.632
They smell blood in the water.

40:27.732 --> 40:29.734
- Who smells blood?
- Everyone.

40:37.903 --> 40:39.906
- Maybe you should take them
to the train station.

40:41.427 --> 40:43.810
The what?

40:43.910 --> 40:45.913
- Could I have a moment
with my daughter?

40:59.328 --> 41:00.670
Have a seat.

41:00.770 --> 41:02.772
No, I'll stand.

41:05.855 --> 41:07.397
What do you want to know?

41:07.497 --> 41:08.719
What is it?

41:08.819 --> 41:12.043
Exactly.

41:12.143 --> 41:15.447
[exhales]

41:15.547 --> 41:17.869
- It's the trash can
for everyone who's attacked us.

41:19.511 --> 41:20.973
It lays in a
jurisdictional dead zone

41:21.073 --> 41:24.137
in a county with
a population of exactly zero.

41:24.237 --> 41:26.499
Hence, no jury of your peers,

41:26.599 --> 41:28.381
and no court for
a change in venue.

41:28.481 --> 41:30.824
Why are you so surprised?

41:30.924 --> 41:33.227
Where did you think the men
who attacked you in your office

41:33.327 --> 41:35.269
and attacked our ranch went?

41:35.369 --> 41:37.592
You're shocked we found
a way to circumvent

41:37.692 --> 41:40.115
the consequences
of defending ourselves?

41:40.215 --> 41:41.596
I'm shocked we need a way.

41:41.696 --> 41:44.119
But we do.
We always have.

41:44.219 --> 41:45.561
And unless we're willing
to walk away

41:45.661 --> 41:46.842
from one hundred
and twenty years

41:46.942 --> 41:48.765
of our family bleeding
into this ground,

41:48.865 --> 41:51.408
we always will.

41:51.508 --> 41:53.510
Jamie knows about it.

41:55.512 --> 41:57.735
Yes.

41:57.835 --> 42:00.498
- Okay, I'm going to repeat
that, Dad.

42:00.598 --> 42:03.481
Jamie knows about it.

42:07.446 --> 42:09.228
I'm aware, Beth.

42:09.328 --> 42:13.713
- He will use everything
that he knows to destroy you.

42:13.813 --> 42:16.516
He has made it clear.

42:16.616 --> 42:18.619
Yes, I believe he has.

42:20.221 --> 42:23.264
[music]

42:45.530 --> 42:47.632
- If there is a place
our enemies go

42:47.732 --> 42:49.674
and nobody ever knows
they went, Dad,

42:49.774 --> 42:51.777
and they will
never come back...

42:58.304 --> 43:00.306
then I think that's
the place for Jamie.

43:05.633 --> 43:07.635
What do you think, Daddy?

43:08.796 --> 43:11.840
[music]

43:19.689 --> 43:21.851
[no audible dialog]

43:25.696 --> 43:27.478
[Jamie winces]

43:27.578 --> 43:28.639
Ow.

43:28.739 --> 43:29.720
Sorry.

43:29.820 --> 43:32.163
I bet.

43:32.263 --> 43:34.886
She's a real piece of work,
your sister.

43:34.986 --> 43:37.329
Oh, yeah.

43:37.429 --> 43:39.431
She's a monster.

43:42.395 --> 43:44.397
She always has been.

43:46.319 --> 43:48.822
She used to stab me under
the dinner table with a fork.

43:48.922 --> 43:50.144
- Mm-hm.

43:50.244 --> 43:52.246
- No reason, just for
the fun of it.

43:54.448 --> 43:56.571
Actually, she's done
it as an adult.

43:58.173 --> 44:00.816
- I would hardly refer
to your sister as an adult.

44:03.979 --> 44:05.982
What do you think
she'll do next?

44:09.946 --> 44:11.328
The truth?

44:11.428 --> 44:13.430
Yeah.

44:17.755 --> 44:19.257
- I'll think she'll
try to have me killed.

44:19.357 --> 44:21.359
[chuckles]

44:22.240 --> 44:24.243
Come on...

44:28.407 --> 44:30.410
You really think so?

44:31.731 --> 44:33.733
Yes.

44:37.618 --> 44:41.322
Do you...
do you know anyone...

44:41.422 --> 44:43.405
or, um...

44:43.505 --> 44:46.048
is there a group

44:46.148 --> 44:48.671
that has experience with
this kind of situation?

44:52.114 --> 44:55.819
- You assign
yourself security, Jamie.

44:55.919 --> 44:57.961
That's playing defence.

44:59.563 --> 45:03.428
[music]

45:03.528 --> 45:05.530
What if I want
to play...

45:06.571 --> 45:08.573
offense?

45:17.063 --> 45:19.065
There are companies, yeah.

45:22.750 --> 45:26.975
There's one in New York,
and there's one in Virginia.

45:27.075 --> 45:29.077
How are they?

45:32.601 --> 45:34.583
They're professionals.

45:34.683 --> 45:36.686
They're not hit men.

45:39.168 --> 45:41.511
It will look like a...

45:41.611 --> 45:44.615
heart attack
or a car accident.

45:50.381 --> 45:52.163
- Perhaps I could
meet with them,

45:52.263 --> 45:54.886
and see how
they would handle this.

45:54.986 --> 45:56.769
- Jamie, you don't
want to do that.

45:56.869 --> 46:00.893
You tell me what you want,

46:00.993 --> 46:05.659
and I will meet with them.

46:05.759 --> 46:09.904
See, if you're going to go
after her, you just might...

46:10.004 --> 46:12.587
Maybe...

46:12.687 --> 46:14.709
You know.

46:14.809 --> 46:18.533
- Yeah, that's what
I was thinking, too.

46:22.218 --> 46:25.321
[music]

46:25.421 --> 46:27.424
[cattle lowing]

46:32.429 --> 46:34.492
- Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

46:34.592 --> 46:36.594
Hey, hey, hey.

46:44.323 --> 46:46.506
What's so funny?

46:46.606 --> 46:48.388
What?

46:48.488 --> 46:51.091
- You're smiling like
the cat that ate the canary.

46:52.172 --> 46:55.316
Oh. Didn't know I was.

46:55.416 --> 46:57.318
- You got a big, old shit-eating
grin on your face

46:57.418 --> 46:59.781
like you spent the night
in some girl's arms.

47:00.822 --> 47:02.604
- I do?
- Yeah.

47:02.704 --> 47:04.807
- They starting younger
and younger.

47:04.907 --> 47:06.689
Okay.

47:06.789 --> 47:10.353
[cattle lowing]

47:38.986 --> 47:40.988
- Morning.
- Morning.

47:42.269 --> 47:44.272
- Just a couple more trucks
and we can go home.

47:45.393 --> 47:48.376
- Can we stop by the East Camp
on the way home?

47:48.476 --> 47:50.499
- How do you know
about East Camp?

47:50.599 --> 47:51.940
Your father told me.

47:52.040 --> 47:54.383
Said it was ours
if we wanted.

47:54.483 --> 47:56.586
If you'd help out while
the cowboys are gone

47:56.686 --> 47:58.828
and he's in Helena.

47:58.928 --> 48:01.031
Is that what you want?

48:01.131 --> 48:03.394
Here's what I don't want.

48:03.494 --> 48:05.716
I don't want to go back
to a rented house

48:05.816 --> 48:09.280
and stare at a nursery
that isn't filled.

48:09.380 --> 48:11.383
And I don't want
to take it down.

48:12.784 --> 48:14.326
I'd rather move it.

48:14.426 --> 48:16.428
Start over and
try again, you know?

48:17.990 --> 48:19.992
Be nice to have
something of our own.

48:20.553 --> 48:22.095
Yeah.

48:22.195 --> 48:24.017
We'd be living
under this again.

48:24.117 --> 48:28.022
Well, I live under it anyway.

48:28.122 --> 48:30.204
- East Camp is not
much of a house, baby.

48:31.406 --> 48:33.408
Yeah, but it would be ours.

48:34.169 --> 48:37.873
[music]

48:37.973 --> 48:41.817
- In my vision,
the choice that I saw,

48:43.259 --> 48:45.261
was between this
place and you.

48:48.465 --> 48:50.467
Was East Camp in your vision?

48:53.110 --> 48:57.035
Well, maybe this is the way
we have both.

49:01.280 --> 49:03.282
- Okay, we'll take
a look at it then.

49:10.010 --> 49:11.111
[laughs]

49:11.211 --> 49:13.614
- Kayce, bring up
another load.

49:19.380 --> 49:21.503

49:28.110 --> 49:30.113
