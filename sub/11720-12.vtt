CHIN: So, the vic's name
is Gus Yamada.

06:47.849 --> 06:49.482
He's a local gangbanger

06:49.484 --> 06:51.017
with a long rap sheet
that says he doesn't

06:51.019 --> 06:52.886

06:52.888 --> 06:54.587
Woman over there worked the bar
last night.

06:54.589 --> 06:56.489
Says the owner, Jack Anderson,
threw Yamada

06:56.491 --> 06:58.474
and one of his boys out
around 11:00

06:58.476 --> 07:00.193
after they mixed it up
with another customer.

07:00.195 --> 07:01.161
We talk to Anderson?

07:01.163 --> 07:02.529
According to
the bartender,

07:02.531 --> 07:03.930
he locked up the
bar around 2:00

07:03.932 --> 07:05.532
but apparently
never made it home.

07:05.534 --> 07:07.233
His wife reported him missing
early this morning.

07:07.235 --> 07:09.252
So, what, we think
Yamada and his pal

07:09.254 --> 07:10.653
waited out here for Anderson

07:10.655 --> 07:12.756
and then confronted him
about being tossed from the bar?

07:12.758 --> 07:13.807
It's a theory.

07:13.809 --> 07:17.143
Looks like he put up one hell
of a good fight.

07:22.216 --> 07:25.135
Hey. Since when does
the captain of SWAT show up

07:25.137 --> 07:26.503

07:26.505 --> 07:28.004
He doesn't.

07:28.006 --> 07:30.106
MAN: Hey, Commander.
Yeah.

07:30.108 --> 07:33.476
You might want to
take a look at this.

07:33.478 --> 07:35.111
Found this
in the Dumpster.

07:35.113 --> 07:38.031
Thank you.

07:38.033 --> 07:40.617
This has got
to be Anderson's phone.

07:41.402 --> 07:43.053
Bridgette must be

07:43.055 --> 07:44.537
his wife.
Looks like she's been

07:44.539 --> 07:45.739
trying to reach him all morning.

07:45.741 --> 07:47.240
Look at this.

07:47.242 --> 07:49.142
His last
incoming call

07:49.144 --> 07:50.493
isn't a local number.
Let's see who else

07:50.495 --> 07:52.361
has been trying to reach him.

Hello?

08:02.723 --> 08:05.058
Yeah, we need to talk.

08:17.623 --> 08:20.541
I met Jack at a charity event
a few months ago.

08:20.543 --> 08:22.010
His bar sponsors a local youth

08:22.012 --> 08:23.811
football team.
And we're both

Illinois boys, born
and raised, and, um...

08:25.732 --> 08:28.316
(clicks tongue)
we bonded over the '85 Bears.

08:28.318 --> 08:30.385
What brought you
down here today?

08:30.387 --> 08:32.303
His wife Bridgette called me.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.105
She was worried
he didn't come home last night,

08:34.107 --> 08:35.606
so she asked me
to come drive down here

08:35.607 --> 08:37.357
and see if his truck
was still here.

08:37.360 --> 08:39.394
(sighs)

08:39.395 --> 08:41.828
He's a good guy, Steve.

08:41.831 --> 08:43.147
Real salt of the earth,

08:43.149 --> 08:44.849
family man.

08:44.851 --> 08:48.786
If he didn't come home
last night, there's a problem.

08:48.788 --> 08:51.289
Look, whatever's gone down,

08:51.291 --> 08:52.840
we're gonna get
to the bottom of it,

08:52.842 --> 08:54.492
okay?

08:54.494 --> 08:56.127
Well, I'm sure glad
you're on this.

08:56.129 --> 08:57.578
Can you, um...

08:57.580 --> 08:58.963
just keep me in the loop?

08:58.965 --> 09:01.031
Of course, man. Come on.

09:03.836 --> 09:06.003
Hey, Lou. You know what?

09:06.005 --> 09:08.005
I can do
one better.

09:08.007 --> 09:10.007
I could use your help
on this one.

09:10.843 --> 09:12.727
Thank you.

FONG: <i>I got a hit in CODIS from a</i>

09:16.599 --> 09:18.049

09:18.051 --> 09:20.017
It came back to this guy.

09:20.019 --> 09:21.736
Dennis Koga.

09:21.738 --> 09:23.571
He's been in and out of prison
for the last few years.

09:23.573 --> 09:25.706
History of assault, robbery...

09:25.708 --> 09:27.158
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.944

from the hospital check I did.

09:30.596 --> 09:32.530
Yeah. Dennis Koga.

09:32.532 --> 09:34.298
He was admitted
to Honolulu General this morning

09:34.300 --> 09:35.733
in serious condition

09:35.735 --> 09:37.769
with multiple contusions and fractures.
STEVE: Hold on a second.

09:37.771 --> 09:41.339
If Yamada is dead and this guy's
in the hospital,

09:41.341 --> 09:43.040
where's Jack Anderson?

09:46.077 --> 09:47.812

09:47.814 --> 09:49.430
Hanging in there.
How about you?

09:49.432 --> 09:50.932
Me? I'm sick.

09:50.934 --> 09:52.183

Danny, okay?

09:53.720 --> 09:54.720

Steve, okay?

09:56.856 --> 09:58.723
Not even barely a kiss
on the cheek.

09:58.725 --> 10:00.558
All right? And this is not
the first time.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.477
This is not the first time
that I have looked

10:02.479 --> 10:04.145

and seen something different.

10:04.147 --> 10:05.396
I don't know what it is.

10:05.398 --> 10:07.031
It's like her innocence
is, uh, floating off

10:07.033 --> 10:08.699
into space or something.
I don't know what.

10:08.701 --> 10:10.201
Yeah, well, she's growing up.

10:10.203 --> 10:11.652
Okay, what are
you gonna do?

10:11.654 --> 10:12.737
I'm gonna build a time machine.

10:12.739 --> 10:13.955
<i>I'm gonna go back in time,</i>
<i>when she</i>

10:13.957 --> 10:15.306
<i>was just a baby,</i>

10:15.308 --> 10:16.624

10:16.626 --> 10:17.992
STEVE:
<i>Okay, good luck with that.</i>

10:17.994 --> 10:19.577
DANNY: <i>You think this</i>
<i>is funny, don't you?</i>

10:19.579 --> 10:20.628
Huh?

10:20.630 --> 10:21.712
No, I don't think it's funny.

10:21.714 --> 10:23.297
I'm just saying
you got to let her go.

10:23.299 --> 10:24.549
You got to let her grow up.

10:24.551 --> 10:25.583
There's nothing you can do.

10:25.585 --> 10:27.585
You're always gonna be Danno
to her.

10:27.587 --> 10:29.921
All right? She's always gonna
love you. Isn't that enough?

10:29.923 --> 10:32.056

10:37.129 --> 10:38.379

10:38.381 --> 10:41.816

to take her bra shopping.

10:41.818 --> 10:43.067
Huh? Or...

10:43.069 --> 10:44.569

shows up.

10:44.571 --> 10:46.303
You're gonna love that.

10:48.825 --> 10:50.208
your big-boy pants

10:50.210 --> 10:53.143

is not your friend.

10:53.145 --> 10:55.830
Will you put Steve back on,

10:59.001 --> 11:00.317
Yeah.

11:00.319 --> 11:03.254
Do not, under any circumstances,
ever do that to me again.

11:03.256 --> 11:06.524
Truth hurt, don't it?

11:06.526 --> 11:07.508
Okay, put him back on.

11:07.510 --> 11:08.960
Okay.

11:08.962 --> 11:10.545

11:10.547 --> 11:11.712
something else...

(phone beeps off)

11:14.184 --> 11:16.133
Excuse me.

11:16.135 --> 11:17.768
Hi. I was wondering
if you might know

11:17.770 --> 11:19.770
if this road would
take me to Hale Iowa?

11:19.772 --> 11:21.889
La... Uh... yes.

11:21.891 --> 11:23.191
Yes, it will.

11:23.193 --> 11:25.326
What?

11:25.328 --> 11:27.177
I totally mangled
that, didn't I?

11:27.179 --> 11:28.312
You did. You destroyed it

11:28.314 --> 11:30.681
completely,
just assassinated it.

11:30.683 --> 11:32.016
It's Hale'iwa,
but don't worry. Please.

11:32.018 --> 11:33.117
I've-I've been here four years,

11:33.119 --> 11:34.902
and I can't pronounce
any of the places

11:34.904 --> 11:35.903
on this island.

11:35.905 --> 11:37.355
And I had you pegged as a local.

11:37.357 --> 11:39.023
Me? No, no, no.

11:39.025 --> 11:41.025
I'm-I'm... I'm from New Jersey.
No way!

11:41.027 --> 11:42.643
We were practically neighbors.
I'm from New York.

11:42.645 --> 11:44.161
Really?
Yeah.

11:44.163 --> 11:45.796
Wow. That's great.
Are you here, uh...?

11:45.798 --> 11:48.032
It's just a vacation?
Are you here for business? What?

11:48.034 --> 11:49.584
None of the above.

11:49.586 --> 11:52.303
I guess you could say
I came here for a fresh start.

11:52.305 --> 11:53.454
Oh, that's nice.

11:53.456 --> 11:56.257
Well, it was nice
meeting you, Jersey.

11:56.259 --> 11:58.826
Nice to meet you, too.

11:59.561 --> 12:01.796
Hey, is there
any chance

12:01.798 --> 12:03.598
you might be headed
towards Hailee...?

12:03.600 --> 12:05.866
Hale'iwa.
Yeah.

12:05.868 --> 12:08.819
I thought if you were going
that way, I might follow you?

12:08.821 --> 12:11.556
Um... I'm not, actually.

12:11.558 --> 12:13.057
I'm-I'm... I'm going
the other direction.

12:13.059 --> 12:15.159
Oh. Okay, then.

12:15.161 --> 12:16.894
Well, I'm sure I'll find my way.

12:16.896 --> 12:18.329
I mean, it's an island, right?

12:18.331 --> 12:19.830
How hard could it be?

12:19.832 --> 12:21.532
Yeah. You just keep
doing circles,

12:21.534 --> 12:23.117
you'll-you'll, uh...
you'll find it.

12:23.119 --> 12:24.669
Thanks for your help.

12:24.671 --> 12:27.004
Have a good fresh start.

12:27.006 --> 12:28.422
Thanks, Jersey.

12:51.780 --> 12:53.948
(engine revving)

12:55.250 --> 12:57.535
Hey, I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

12:57.537 --> 12:59.620
Jack Anderson-- where is he?

12:59.622 --> 13:02.239
And I'm gonna tell you one
more time. You want to talk,

13:02.241 --> 13:03.441
talk to my lawyer.

13:03.443 --> 13:04.909
(sighs)

13:04.911 --> 13:06.794
Do me a favor,
would you?

13:06.796 --> 13:09.613
Can you close the door?
Absolutely.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.550
Just be a minute.

13:15.587 --> 13:16.954
(groan, gasps,
monitors beep rapidly)

13:16.956 --> 13:18.389
What's the matter?

13:18.391 --> 13:19.890
WOMAN (over intercom):
Everything all right, Mr. Koga?

13:19.892 --> 13:22.143
(panting)
Never better, Nurse.

13:22.145 --> 13:23.477
Thank you.
You can't do this.

13:23.479 --> 13:25.513
Oh, I am doing it.
See, I'm with Five-O.

13:25.515 --> 13:27.765
They got immunity and means.
Ain't that right, Commander?

13:27.767 --> 13:29.400
That's right, Captain.

13:29.402 --> 13:33.187
That means... I can do
whatever the hell I want.

13:33.189 --> 13:34.822
You watch this.

13:36.591 --> 13:39.994
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I don't know where he is.

13:39.996 --> 13:41.478
That's the truth.
I swear, I don't know!

13:41.480 --> 13:43.280
Calm down, calm down.
Just tell me what you do know.

13:43.282 --> 13:44.915
Okay, look...

13:44.917 --> 13:47.001
The guy Anderson

13:47.003 --> 13:48.252
disrespected Gus.

13:48.254 --> 13:50.504
He just wanted
to teach the dude a lesson.

13:50.506 --> 13:52.006
What kind of lesson?

13:52.008 --> 13:53.791
We waited for him.

13:56.962 --> 13:58.412
<i>Gus had a knife.</i>

13:58.414 --> 14:00.631
<i>He went at the man</i>
<i>and tried to cut him...</i>

14:00.633 --> 14:02.850
but he fought back.

14:05.520 --> 14:06.537
I've never seen anyone

14:06.539 --> 14:08.989
<i>fight like that.</i>

14:10.625 --> 14:13.394
<i>He got the knife away from Gus</i>
<i>and killed him with it.</i>

14:13.396 --> 14:16.530
<i>Planted that thing</i>
<i>right in his chest.</i>

14:16.532 --> 14:18.182
I tried to help Gus.

14:18.184 --> 14:22.203
<i>The guy beat me down.</i>

14:22.205 --> 14:23.454
There was nothing I could do.

14:23.456 --> 14:24.622
STEVE:
But run.

14:24.624 --> 14:25.740
(yells)

14:25.742 --> 14:27.208
(groans)

14:27.210 --> 14:28.709
Would've killed me, too,
if I didn't.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.246
All right,
so you take your beating.

14:32.248 --> 14:34.248
And where does Anderson go
after that?

14:34.250 --> 14:36.584
No idea.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.837
STEVE:
<i>So, where'd your boy Jack</i>

14:39.839 --> 14:41.922
learn to fight
like that, Grover?

14:41.924 --> 14:43.591
Hell if I know.

14:43.593 --> 14:45.426
Military?

14:45.428 --> 14:47.311
Jack's a man of few words.

14:47.313 --> 14:49.230
doesn't talk
about himself that much.

14:49.232 --> 14:51.215
Must have been some
scintillating conversations

14:51.217 --> 14:53.484
between the two of you.

14:53.486 --> 14:55.736
It's called being humble.

14:55.738 --> 14:59.356
Maybe you should
try it sometime.

14:59.358 --> 15:01.391
All right, so...
Koga's statement confirms

15:01.393 --> 15:03.444
that Jack killed Yamada
in self-defense.

15:03.446 --> 15:06.363
Any jury in the world would have
seen it the same way.

15:06.365 --> 15:07.982
So, where the hell is he?

15:07.984 --> 15:09.750
I mean, why didn't
he just stick around

15:09.752 --> 15:11.719
and call the cops?
Then it's over.

15:11.721 --> 15:15.072
Better yet,
why didn't he call you?

15:18.760 --> 15:22.046
Yes, I admit, uh, following you
might be a little crazy,

15:22.048 --> 15:24.882
but I want you to know
that I am not crazy.

15:24.884 --> 15:29.103
I know somebody who is crazy,
and I am nothing... like him.

15:29.105 --> 15:31.088
Although, I am talking
to myself,

15:31.090 --> 15:33.257
so that makes me crazy.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.863

16:25.912 --> 16:27.995
half mile east

16:27.997 --> 16:29.146
I need paramedics.

16:29.148 --> 16:30.831
MAN: What's the nature
of her injuries?

16:30.833 --> 16:32.199
I don't know. I don't know.

16:32.201 --> 16:34.368
She's not breathing,
can't find a pulse.

16:34.370 --> 16:35.703
She's, uh...
she's unconscious.

16:35.705 --> 16:37.004
She could be dying.

16:37.006 --> 16:39.323
Come on, just s-send
the ambulance, please.

16:42.127 --> 16:44.261
Oh. Hello. Hey.

16:44.263 --> 16:47.681
I-I got a... I got a gunshot
wound to the back of the neck.

16:47.683 --> 16:50.518
Put a rush
on that ambulance, okay?

16:50.520 --> 16:52.836

18:16.527 --> 18:19.278
that CSU lifted off the murder
weapon match reference prints

18:19.280 --> 18:21.881
we took from Jack
Anderson's house.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.316
Well, that's consistent
with Koga's story.

18:23.318 --> 18:25.251
He told us Anderson stabbed
Yamada to death

18:25.253 --> 18:26.953
with his own knife.
Mm-hmm.

18:26.955 --> 18:29.088
What aren't you telling us,
Chin?

18:31.558 --> 18:34.760
Anderson's prints
also popped up in AFIS.

18:34.762 --> 18:36.979
(computer chirps)

18:36.981 --> 18:40.383
He's a decorated
Gulf War vet.

18:40.385 --> 18:43.119
A Green Beret who just
finished a tour in Iraq

18:43.121 --> 18:44.487
when this went down.

18:44.489 --> 18:46.772
According to the DeKalb PD,

18:46.774 --> 18:48.641
Anderson was the driver
of a getaway car

18:48.643 --> 18:50.026
in an armed robbery
of a liquor store

18:50.028 --> 18:52.094
back in 1993.

18:52.096 --> 18:55.114
Now, the car that he was driving
crashed into another vehicle,

18:55.116 --> 18:56.982
killing its driver,
a newlywed

18:56.984 --> 18:59.835
named Jessica Haley.
She was on her way home

18:59.837 --> 19:01.254
from work.

19:01.256 --> 19:02.588
This guy really had me fooled.

19:02.590 --> 19:04.290
Well, you and a lot
of other people.

19:04.292 --> 19:06.926
His accomplices were caught
fleeing the scene,

19:06.928 --> 19:08.961
but somehow, he seemed
to disappear off

19:08.963 --> 19:11.147
the face of the earth...
until today.

19:12.266 --> 19:15.000
Jack deliberately tossed
that cell phone in a Dumpster

19:15.002 --> 19:16.802
because he didn't want anybody
ind him.

19:16.804 --> 19:18.521
Jack Anderson's not

19:18.523 --> 19:20.172
a missing person.

19:20.174 --> 19:21.791
He's on the run.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.561
(knocking)

19:25.563 --> 19:27.680
(sighs)
Is Jack okay?

19:27.682 --> 19:30.015
Did you find him?
No, not yet. Uh,

19:30.017 --> 19:31.701
Bridgette, we need to talk
to you about something.

19:31.703 --> 19:33.736
What is it?

19:33.738 --> 19:35.655
What's wrong?

19:35.657 --> 19:38.190
Steve, can you give
us a minute, please?

19:38.192 --> 19:40.376
Yeah.

19:43.863 --> 19:44.964
Did you know?

19:44.966 --> 19:46.649
Did I know what?

19:46.651 --> 19:48.034
What Jack did back in DeKalb?

19:48.036 --> 19:49.302
I'm sorry.

19:49.304 --> 19:51.053
I don't know
what you're talking about.

19:51.055 --> 19:52.388
Hey, guys.

19:53.924 --> 19:55.174
Are you a policeman?

19:55.176 --> 19:56.726
Am I a policeman?

19:56.728 --> 19:59.044
Why? Because of this right here?

19:59.046 --> 20:00.879
That a real badge?

20:00.881 --> 20:02.898
Is this a real badge?

20:02.900 --> 20:06.051
You want to see it?

20:06.053 --> 20:08.270
GROVER: Fingerprints don't lie,
Bridgette.

20:08.272 --> 20:11.691
Your husband is wanted
for murder back in Illinois.

20:11.693 --> 20:14.193
He would never...

20:14.195 --> 20:15.578
You know him.

20:15.580 --> 20:17.563
You know the kind of man he is.

20:17.565 --> 20:19.732
I thought I did.

20:22.452 --> 20:24.503
Now, you listen
to me very carefully.

20:24.505 --> 20:26.255
In a couple of hours,

20:26.257 --> 20:28.774
this whole island's gonna be
crawling with HPD,

20:28.776 --> 20:30.209
FBI and Illinois State Police,

20:30.211 --> 20:32.345
and they're all gonna be
looking for your husband.

20:32.347 --> 20:33.929
And there'll be
some young, gung ho,

20:33.931 --> 20:36.098
trigger-happy cops looking
to make a name for themselves

20:36.100 --> 20:38.584
by bringing in a fugitive
on a 20-year-old murder case.

20:38.586 --> 20:40.469
And they don't know
Jack, the family man.

20:40.471 --> 20:43.139
They only know Jack,
the fugitive, and they're gonna

20:43.141 --> 20:46.142
bring him in
by any means necessary.

20:48.695 --> 20:52.064
Bridgette, I know
this is a lot. I'm sorry.

20:52.066 --> 20:54.933
But I'm gonna need your help.

20:54.935 --> 20:57.603
If you know where he might be,

20:57.605 --> 21:00.122
if he's tried to contact you,

21:00.124 --> 21:01.707
you need to tell me right now.

21:01.709 --> 21:03.909
I don't. I swear.

21:03.911 --> 21:05.344
Bridgette,
the boys said

21:05.346 --> 21:07.163
that Jack came back to
the house this morning.

21:07.165 --> 21:09.331
(sighs)

21:10.217 --> 21:11.801
Uh, I must have been asleep.

21:11.803 --> 21:13.269
Yeah, that's
what they said.

21:13.271 --> 21:14.720
He made them promise not

21:14.722 --> 21:16.589
to tell anybody that
he'd come back here.

21:16.591 --> 21:17.773
I guess he
grabbed a rifle

21:17.775 --> 21:19.892
and some camping gear.
He also told them that

21:19.894 --> 21:21.811
he might be away
for a little while.

21:21.813 --> 21:23.929
You got any idea
where that might be?

21:23.931 --> 21:25.898
He goes...

21:25.900 --> 21:28.768
hunting
in the Ewa Forest Reserve.

21:28.770 --> 21:32.805
Uh, he-he
usually makes

21:32.807 --> 21:34.907
camp around
the Waimano Stream.

21:34.909 --> 21:37.326
Okay. I know where that is.
Thanks.

21:38.695 --> 21:40.479
(clears throat)

21:42.516 --> 21:43.966
All right,

21:43.968 --> 21:46.452
listen, don't worry, we're
gonna bring him in safe.

21:46.454 --> 21:48.187
Meantime, you just take
care of those boys,

21:48.189 --> 21:49.588
all right?

21:52.292 --> 21:54.844
(pop music plays)

21:54.846 --> 21:56.078
(camera shutter clicking)

21:56.080 --> 21:58.380
MAN: That looks perfect,
just like that.

21:58.382 --> 21:59.482
Good.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.101
Thatta girl.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.069
Excellent. Excellent.
These are beautiful.

22:04.071 --> 22:05.504
Turn here. Yes.

22:05.506 --> 22:07.389
(camera clicking)
Yes.

22:07.391 --> 22:08.974
Nice. That's good.

22:08.976 --> 22:10.342
Right there.
Keep your chin up.

22:10.344 --> 22:11.977
Nice. These are beautiful.

22:12.612 --> 22:13.762
Head down.
Excuse me.

22:13.764 --> 22:15.281
Sorry. I'm Detective Williams.

22:15.283 --> 22:17.450
I'm with Five-O.
I need to see this weapon.

22:19.152 --> 22:21.520
I need to see any other
weapons you have here.

22:21.522 --> 22:23.656
As soon as you tell
me what's going on.

22:23.658 --> 22:25.207
I'll tell you what's
going on-- there's a woman,

22:25.209 --> 22:26.992
she's in the hospital right now
fighting for her life.

22:26.994 --> 22:28.677
She was shot
up on that highway

22:28.679 --> 22:30.379
from this beach.
Like I said,

22:30.381 --> 22:32.882
I need to see
all the weapons you have.

22:35.752 --> 22:37.720
Thank you.

22:42.726 --> 22:45.895
Look, Detective, all
the weapons on this shoot

22:45.897 --> 22:47.012
are props.

22:47.014 --> 22:48.481
They're inoperable.
Trust me,

22:48.483 --> 22:50.399
I checked
'em myself.

22:51.885 --> 22:53.986
All right, how long you
been here this morning?

22:53.988 --> 22:55.220
Since sunrise.

22:55.222 --> 22:56.572
See anybody else?

22:56.574 --> 22:57.990
Just us.

23:01.278 --> 23:03.028
All right, I'm gonna need to see

23:03.030 --> 23:05.273
all the photographs
you took here this morning.

23:05.298 --> 23:07.298
Yeah.

23:08.118 --> 23:11.203
Look, I'm just calling
to see how she's doing.

23:11.205 --> 23:13.589
I don't know her name. She's
the one with the gunshot wound.

23:13.591 --> 23:14.907
How many are there?

23:14.909 --> 23:17.176
No, please don't put me on hold.

23:30.524 --> 23:32.090
(phone beeps off)

23:47.874 --> 23:49.325
What do you got for me, Duke?

23:49.327 --> 23:51.727
CSU found some stuff
in Gus Yamada's house.

23:51.729 --> 23:53.278
Thought you might be interested.

23:55.165 --> 23:57.883
Yamada doesn't strike me
as the type who went to church.

23:57.885 --> 24:00.586
All right, so what
do we got here?

24:00.588 --> 24:01.537
Photos.

24:01.539 --> 24:03.756
Directions
to Anderson's bar.

24:03.758 --> 24:05.591
Daily schedule.

24:07.126 --> 24:09.311
It's a picture of his truck.
This is a surveillance package.

24:09.313 --> 24:10.629
He was being paid well.

24:10.631 --> 24:11.814
There's ten grand in there.

24:11.816 --> 24:14.149
It was in the gym bag
along with this burner.

24:14.151 --> 24:16.318
All right, so Yamada didn't
show up at Anderson's bar

24:16.320 --> 24:18.437
to sample the mai tais;
they were watching him.

24:19.439 --> 24:21.907
This was supposed to be a hit.

24:39.934 --> 24:42.435
STEVE: Any idea who would
want to kill your friend?

24:43.704 --> 24:45.138
Well,

24:45.140 --> 24:46.272
Jack's a fugitive.

24:46.274 --> 24:48.024
I imagine he's crossed
a lot of people

24:48.026 --> 24:49.225
between here
and Chicago,

24:49.227 --> 24:51.127
but I don't know,
I don't want to be

24:51.129 --> 24:52.228
the one to speculate.

24:52.230 --> 24:54.013
I'd rather ask him
myself, in person.

24:55.166 --> 24:59.185
You can slow down if you,
uh, if you can't keep up.

24:59.187 --> 25:01.838
You know, my old man
once told me...

25:01.840 --> 25:04.290
never mistake somebody
who's moving fast

25:04.292 --> 25:07.410
with somebody who knows
where they're going.

25:07.412 --> 25:09.629
Yeah, all due respect,
your old man didn't know me.

25:09.631 --> 25:11.381
I move fast and I know
where I'm going.

25:11.383 --> 25:14.384
Boy, I wish I was half as good
as you think you are.

25:14.386 --> 25:15.552
(insect buzzes)

25:15.554 --> 25:17.554
Ow.

25:17.556 --> 25:19.339
Long way from Chicago, huh?

25:19.341 --> 25:21.341
What's that supposed to mean?

25:21.343 --> 25:23.026
You think I don't know
my way around

25:23.028 --> 25:24.544
in the woods?

25:24.546 --> 25:26.146
First of all, this is a forest.

25:26.148 --> 25:28.481
Second of all,
if you knew your way

25:28.483 --> 25:30.233
around this forest...

25:30.235 --> 25:32.218
you'd know that the shrub
you're standing next to

25:32.220 --> 25:33.719
is <i>noho malie.</i>

25:33.721 --> 25:35.155
It's highly poisonous.

25:42.563 --> 25:44.614
Well, thank you,
Ranger Rick.

25:45.566 --> 25:48.418
You're welcome.

25:48.420 --> 25:49.869
Ah.

25:49.871 --> 25:51.454
You know, going
through these woods--

25:51.456 --> 25:54.574
oh, I'm sorry, "the forest"--

25:54.576 --> 25:56.593
kind of opens your mind up.

25:56.595 --> 25:58.294
Helps you see things
a little differently.

25:58.296 --> 25:59.912
What, are you getting
all Zen on me, now?

25:59.914 --> 26:02.098
No, I'm just telling you
I know what this is.

26:04.385 --> 26:06.436
Would you want to
tell me what this is?

26:06.438 --> 26:08.304
This:

26:08.306 --> 26:10.356
"I could really use your help."

26:10.358 --> 26:12.008
You think I think
that you partnered up

26:12.010 --> 26:15.094
with me on this out of the
goodness of your heart?

26:15.096 --> 26:17.030
All right.
Fair enough.

26:17.032 --> 26:18.731
You're Jack's friend.

26:18.733 --> 26:20.150
I know you're not
gonna go home,

26:20.152 --> 26:22.935
sit in your rocking chair and
wait on a call from me, okay?

26:22.937 --> 26:24.070
You're gonna be out here

26:24.072 --> 26:25.955
making a mess of things, you know?
There you go.

26:25.957 --> 26:28.291
Get in my way, so I figured
I'd do myself a favor, right?

26:28.293 --> 26:29.576
Save myself the trouble.

26:29.578 --> 26:31.628
But you're only
half right.

26:31.630 --> 26:33.963
Catherine Rollins
is on reserve duty.

26:33.965 --> 26:37.000
I got Danno on the North Shore,
I'm short-handed...

26:37.002 --> 26:38.718
so I thought about it
and figured

26:38.720 --> 26:41.337
you were competent enough
to tag along.

26:43.307 --> 26:45.725
Competent enough?

26:45.727 --> 26:47.977
Well, you ain't exactly
Mount Rushmore material

26:47.979 --> 26:49.429
yourself, you know.

26:49.431 --> 26:52.232
CHIN: <i>Come on, it's</i>
<i>a simple question.</i>

26:52.234 --> 26:55.068
Who hired you
to murder Jack Anderson?

26:55.070 --> 26:56.436
I just need a name.

26:56.438 --> 26:58.438
I don't have a name.

26:58.440 --> 27:00.690
So do whatever
you got to do.

27:00.692 --> 27:02.308
Torture me
like your friends did,

27:02.310 --> 27:04.194
'cause I can't tell you
something I don't know.

27:04.196 --> 27:06.946
Yeah, well, you see,
torture isn't really my style.

27:08.832 --> 27:10.450
Now, Koga...

27:10.452 --> 27:13.169
you got a three-year-old son
and a little girl, right?

27:14.838 --> 27:16.422
You've been
through the system.

27:16.424 --> 27:17.840
You know
how it works.

27:17.842 --> 27:19.709
First person to step up
gets a deal,

27:19.711 --> 27:22.428
and Yamada is dead.

27:22.430 --> 27:24.347
I call that an opportunity.

27:24.349 --> 27:26.832
Look, you talk now...

27:26.834 --> 27:28.668
maybe you serve
two to three years

27:28.670 --> 27:30.019
in a minimum-security
prison

27:30.021 --> 27:33.439
and you get some kind of
relationship with your children.

27:33.441 --> 27:35.525
But if you don't...

27:35.527 --> 27:36.976
I promise you,

27:36.978 --> 27:39.445
you will sit
in a maximum-security prison

27:39.447 --> 27:43.015
for 15 to 20 years
watching your kids grow up

27:43.017 --> 27:44.984
through a piece
of Plexiglas.

27:47.988 --> 27:49.822
So you got
a decision to make.

27:51.292 --> 27:53.543
Because when
I walk out that door...

27:53.545 --> 27:54.661
(sighs)

27:54.663 --> 27:57.196
the deal goes with me.

28:02.002 --> 28:03.469
Okay, look...

28:06.974 --> 28:09.309
I'll tell you who hired us.

28:10.344 --> 28:13.396
STEVE:
Decorated war hero.

28:13.398 --> 28:15.265
Never in trouble with the law.

28:15.267 --> 28:16.733
How's a guy like that end up

28:16.735 --> 28:18.985
robbing a liquor store?

28:18.987 --> 28:21.554
GROVER: I don't know.
Maybe he was drunk or high.

28:21.556 --> 28:23.022
Doesn't really matter, does it?
No, it doesn't.

28:23.024 --> 28:24.240
I'm not trying to give the guy

28:24.242 --> 28:26.392
a free pass, either.
I'm just saying.

28:26.394 --> 28:28.611
Maybe he made a mistake,
you know?

28:30.748 --> 28:31.897
I mean...

28:31.899 --> 28:33.666
it's got to stand
for something that he

28:33.668 --> 28:35.201
turned his entire
life around,

28:35.203 --> 28:36.669
spent the next
20 years trying

28:36.671 --> 28:38.070
to make it right.

28:38.072 --> 28:40.340
And what if it was
your sister

28:40.342 --> 28:41.357
and my wife
and kids

28:41.359 --> 28:43.293
he killed in that
car wreck?

28:43.295 --> 28:45.044
What he did before,
what he did after,

28:45.046 --> 28:46.129
wouldn't mean
a damn thing.

28:46.131 --> 28:47.847
Listen, man, you got
a good point, okay?

28:47.849 --> 28:49.065
I'm just saying...

28:49.067 --> 28:50.717
You can't tell me
it's gonna feel good

28:50.719 --> 28:53.353
putting the cuffs on a guy
like that, now, okay?

28:53.355 --> 28:55.355
Plus, he's your friend.
Try to think of the victim's family.

28:55.357 --> 28:57.106
Well, what about Jack's family?

28:57.108 --> 28:59.475
You think I don't
have a heart?

28:59.477 --> 29:02.145
I got a knot in my stomach
just thinking about all this.

29:02.147 --> 29:03.229
Man, I'm just saying

29:03.231 --> 29:05.648
don't write him off
completely, okay?

29:05.650 --> 29:07.767
Sometimes good people
do bad things.

29:07.769 --> 29:09.569
We're all running from
something, right?

29:10.988 --> 29:13.439
Could you be any more obvious?

29:14.775 --> 29:15.892
Excuse me?

29:15.894 --> 29:18.061
If you want
something from me,

29:18.063 --> 29:19.228
just ask.

29:19.230 --> 29:21.881
Them Jedi mind tricks
don't work with me.

29:22.716 --> 29:24.083
Fine.

29:24.085 --> 29:25.968
What drove you
out of Chicago?

29:28.639 --> 29:31.257
Forget it. You and me--
we ain't there, yet.

29:35.496 --> 29:38.264
STEVE:
Hold up, hold up, h-hold up.

29:43.570 --> 29:46.972
These are fresh.

29:46.974 --> 29:49.975
He can't be more than ten
or 15 minutes ahead of us.

30:02.623 --> 30:03.756
Hello.

30:03.758 --> 30:05.324
How you doing?
Can I help you?

30:05.326 --> 30:07.543
Uh, yeah, I'm, uh,
Detective Williams

30:07.545 --> 30:09.345
with Five-O.
Um, just need to ask you,

30:09.347 --> 30:10.947
do you have a rifle on board?

30:10.949 --> 30:13.499
We do. We use it
when we go shark fishing.

30:13.501 --> 30:14.550
Okay.
What's the problem?

30:14.552 --> 30:16.302
Uh, you're gonna
have to point to it,

30:16.304 --> 30:17.420
show me where it is.

30:17.422 --> 30:18.938
Please stay
where you are.

30:18.940 --> 30:20.005
It's in there.

30:20.007 --> 30:21.174
In here?
Yup.

30:21.176 --> 30:23.175
What's going on?

30:34.187 --> 30:36.155
This, uh, this was
fired recently.

30:36.157 --> 30:38.624
Yeah. Um...
we were fishing

30:38.626 --> 30:39.776
off the beach this morning,

30:39.778 --> 30:41.544
and nothing
was biting, so, uh...

30:41.546 --> 30:43.629
I let my son Jon
use it to...

30:43.631 --> 30:46.215
take target practice
on the chum can in the water.

30:48.201 --> 30:50.681
Weren't any other boats around.
Didn't think it'd be a problem.

30:52.089 --> 30:54.340
What's going on, Detective?

30:54.342 --> 30:55.641
Something happen?

30:55.643 --> 30:57.894
Uh, yeah, something, uh...

30:57.896 --> 31:00.513
something pretty terrible
happened, actually.

31:07.404 --> 31:09.221
(phone rings)
Chin. Go.

31:09.223 --> 31:10.156
I know who hired

31:10.158 --> 31:11.724
Yamada and Koga
to kill Anderson.

31:11.726 --> 31:12.725
Who?

31:12.727 --> 31:14.110
Matt Haley.

31:14.112 --> 31:15.361
He's the husband
of Jessica Haley,

31:15.363 --> 31:16.412
the woman that Anderson

31:16.414 --> 31:17.497
killed in the car crash.

31:17.499 --> 31:18.948
So wait a minute,

31:18.950 --> 31:20.399
Haley finds Anderson

31:20.401 --> 31:22.452
on the islands after
all these years,

31:22.454 --> 31:24.403
and then hires
Yamada to avenge

31:24.405 --> 31:26.172
his wife's death?
What are the chances

31:26.174 --> 31:27.406
Haley's on the island?

31:27.408 --> 31:28.691
Oh, I'm thinking pretty good.

31:28.693 --> 31:30.259
I have several
incoming calls to Yamada's

31:30.261 --> 31:32.244
burner phone,
all from a Malohi Inn.

31:32.246 --> 31:33.563
One of them was

31:33.565 --> 31:34.580
as recent as an hour ago.

31:34.582 --> 31:35.765
It was probably Haley

31:35.767 --> 31:37.350
trying to find out
if the job's done.

31:37.352 --> 31:38.384
That's what I'm thinking.

31:38.386 --> 31:40.419
I'll let you know.
I'm on my way.

31:40.421 --> 31:42.054
STEVE:
<i>Copy that.</i>

31:48.595 --> 31:51.047
(birds fly off)

31:51.049 --> 31:52.698
You see that?

31:53.650 --> 31:55.651
200 yards up ahead.

31:55.653 --> 31:57.236
See those birds?

31:57.238 --> 31:58.721
Yeah, I see.

32:01.291 --> 32:02.875
All right.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.276
We're gonna split up.

32:04.278 --> 32:06.462
I'm gonna maintain
this heading.

32:06.464 --> 32:08.581
Lou, I want you
to flank north.

32:08.583 --> 32:10.132
Okay?
Yeah.

32:10.134 --> 32:11.133
Remember...

32:11.135 --> 32:13.118
radio silence
and good target I.D.

32:13.120 --> 32:15.287
I got you.

32:19.109 --> 32:20.977
(branches snapping)

32:34.641 --> 32:36.826
(twigs crack)

32:52.543 --> 32:53.993
You shouldn't
have come.

33:07.668 --> 33:09.269
How many with you?

33:09.271 --> 33:10.620
I'm alone.

33:12.106 --> 33:13.673
With a radio?

33:13.675 --> 33:14.791
Let's go.

33:14.793 --> 33:16.977
Move!

33:18.095 --> 33:20.180
So what's the plan now, Jack?

33:20.182 --> 33:22.298
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill me,

33:22.300 --> 33:25.018
then hide up here in the woods
for the rest of your life

33:25.020 --> 33:26.236
living happily ever after?

33:26.238 --> 33:30.774
Personally, I don't
think you got it in you.

33:30.776 --> 33:32.442
Sure, you took that guy
in the alley,

33:32.444 --> 33:33.576
but that's kill or be killed.

33:33.578 --> 33:35.612
Stop talking and keep moving.

33:35.614 --> 33:39.299
That woman you killed, Jack,
that was an accident.

33:39.301 --> 33:42.535
And I know that you've done
a lot of things, good things,

33:42.537 --> 33:43.837
to try to make that right,

33:43.839 --> 33:46.573
but you never will.
You never will

33:46.575 --> 33:47.907
till you own up to it.

33:47.909 --> 33:49.843
I own up to it every day.

33:49.845 --> 33:52.412
You don't think
I carry that with me?

33:52.414 --> 33:55.331
That woman is
in my head all the time.

33:55.333 --> 33:57.350
I was a good guy,

33:57.352 --> 33:59.653
and I just did something stupid.

33:59.655 --> 34:01.838
I got behind
the wheel of a car,

34:01.840 --> 34:03.506
and in ten minutes,
my life changed forever

34:03.508 --> 34:05.125
and I can't undo that.

34:07.645 --> 34:09.646
No matter how hard I try.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.031
You think you're
the only one?

34:11.033 --> 34:14.818
You think I don't know
what living with regret

34:14.820 --> 34:16.518
is like?
Hmm?

34:16.521 --> 34:19.406
Every day, I look in the mirror
and I think to myself,

34:19.408 --> 34:21.824
"What if I did this?
What if I did that?"

34:23.043 --> 34:25.862
So welcome to the
club, my friend.

34:26.697 --> 34:29.416
Listen to me, Jack.

34:29.418 --> 34:31.568
You got to end this thing.

34:31.570 --> 34:35.472
Hmm? You got to end
it right now, Jack.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.590
Not for me.

34:37.592 --> 34:40.260
Take a second to think about
Bridgette and them two boys.

34:40.262 --> 34:41.995
(twigs snapping)

34:41.996 --> 34:44.313
(grunts)

34:46.851 --> 34:49.018
Oh, Jack.

34:51.237 --> 34:52.989
You got him?

34:52.991 --> 34:54.858
About time. What happened?

34:54.860 --> 34:58.661
I was trying to figure out a way
to save your ass, wasn't I?

35:01.298 --> 35:03.183
All right, come on, Jack,
let's go. On your feet.

35:03.185 --> 35:05.702
On your feet.

35:12.426 --> 35:15.411
Five-O! Get on your knees.
Hands behind your head.

35:17.214 --> 35:20.183
Matt Haley, you're under arrest
for conspiracy

35:20.185 --> 35:21.885
and the attempted murder
of Jack Anderson.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.937
Mitchell. Jack Mitchell.

35:23.939 --> 35:27.440
That was his name
when he killed my wife.

35:41.772 --> 35:44.574
What are we doing here?
I told you.

35:44.576 --> 35:46.726
I don't want my wife and kids
to see me like this.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.211
Turn around.
Give me your hands, Jack.

36:01.559 --> 36:03.927
You know what you got to do.
Go ahead.

36:20.978 --> 36:23.279
(exhales)

36:23.281 --> 36:25.832
(crying)
I'm sorry.

36:25.834 --> 36:27.567
I'm so sorry.

36:27.569 --> 36:29.886
Look,

36:29.888 --> 36:33.423
there's something
I need to tell you,

36:33.425 --> 36:35.458
and I should have told you
a long time ago.

36:36.594 --> 36:40.680
So how much of that sermon
you gave in the forest was true?

36:41.665 --> 36:43.666
All that stuff
about living with regret,

36:43.668 --> 36:46.335
looking at yourself
in the mirror, blah, blah, blah.

36:46.337 --> 36:48.021
So you heard that?

36:48.023 --> 36:49.472
The whole thing.

36:49.474 --> 36:51.691
Then I guess that
means you heard me say

36:51.693 --> 36:55.278
me and you ain't there yet.
(chuckles)

36:56.864 --> 36:58.448
Hey. Hey, boys.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.033
How you doing, boys?

37:00.035 --> 37:02.252
Hey, listen to me,
all right? Look,

37:02.254 --> 37:05.705
Daddy's gonna have to go away
for a little while, okay?

37:05.707 --> 37:07.607
But I want... I want you
to behave for your mom.

37:07.609 --> 37:10.076
You understand?
All right.

37:10.078 --> 37:12.695
Give me a hug.
Give me a hug.

37:26.177 --> 37:28.094
Thank you.

37:33.100 --> 37:35.051
If you don't mind,

37:35.053 --> 37:37.904
there's one more stop
I'd like to make.

37:42.610 --> 37:45.278
CHIN:
<i>The church bulletin?</i>

37:45.280 --> 37:47.497
That's how you found
Jack Mitchell?

37:48.532 --> 37:51.417
A couple weeks ago,
a buddy of mine from DeKalb

37:51.419 --> 37:53.036
was here on vacation.

37:53.038 --> 37:55.672
He went to Mass,
saw the picture.

37:55.674 --> 37:58.424
Thought it looked a lot
like Mitchell.

37:58.426 --> 38:00.076
So I did some digging.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.427
Turns out he was right.

38:01.429 --> 38:03.846
Did it ever cross your mind
to go to the police?

38:03.848 --> 38:06.049
No.

38:07.134 --> 38:09.135
Have you ever had
someone you love

38:09.137 --> 38:11.387
stolen from you,
Lieutenant?

38:16.143 --> 38:18.311
Yes, I have.

38:19.446 --> 38:21.381
Then you know.

38:23.817 --> 38:27.270
Hate corrodes the container
it's carried in.

38:27.272 --> 38:30.907
I've carried that hate around
with me for 20 years.

38:30.909 --> 38:32.775
I never remarried,

38:32.777 --> 38:36.246
never had the family
I dreamt of with Jess.

38:36.248 --> 38:39.015
That night changed me.

38:39.017 --> 38:41.217
(door buzzes)

39:01.572 --> 39:05.858
I know there's nothing I can do
that would bring your wife back.

39:09.446 --> 39:12.148
All I can do
is say...

39:13.000 --> 39:16.652
...I'm sorry.

39:45.115 --> 39:46.532
(exhales)

39:48.502 --> 39:50.686
Hey.

39:51.688 --> 39:53.656
How you feeling?

39:53.658 --> 39:55.691
(sighs)

39:55.693 --> 39:57.760
I've been better.

39:57.762 --> 39:59.412
Yeah, I bet.

39:59.414 --> 40:01.297
Do you remember me?

40:01.299 --> 40:03.249
Jersey.

40:03.251 --> 40:04.533
Yeah.

40:06.136 --> 40:10.423
The last thing I remember,
you were in my rearview mirror.

40:10.425 --> 40:13.393
I thought you were headed
the other direction.

40:14.678 --> 40:17.280
I was headed
the other direction.

40:17.282 --> 40:20.416
Well, what made you change
your mind?

40:20.418 --> 40:23.986
(clicks tongue)
Um,

40:23.988 --> 40:25.655
I don't know. Uh,

40:25.657 --> 40:27.323
I think maybe that smile's what did it.
(chuckles)

40:27.325 --> 40:28.791
That's definitely what it was.

40:28.793 --> 40:32.495
I know
this sounds crazy,

40:32.497 --> 40:34.530
um, but I-I couldn't stop
thinking about you when I was

40:34.532 --> 40:36.399
driving away,
so...

40:36.401 --> 40:38.668
That doesn't sound crazy.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.286
No?
No.

40:40.288 --> 40:41.454
Good.

40:41.456 --> 40:43.122
(chuckles)

40:43.124 --> 40:46.426
I don't think
I ever got your name.

40:46.428 --> 40:49.412
Uh, I'm, uh, Danny. Williams.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.214
I'm Amber.

40:51.216 --> 40:52.548
Amber Vitale.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.050
Amber Vitale.

40:54.052 --> 40:56.936
That's the best name I ever heard.
(chuckles)

40:56.938 --> 40:58.888
That's an excellent,
excellent name.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.423
Thank you.

41:00.425 --> 41:03.025
Sounds like an Italian
movie star or something.

41:03.027 --> 41:04.310
(laughs)

41:07.631 --> 41:09.932
COMMENTATOR: Snap to the 35.
Drops back to the pocket.

41:09.934 --> 41:11.701
Throws over the middle.
STEVE: Come on!

41:11.703 --> 41:12.711
And it's caught!

41:12.736 --> 41:14.688
All right, party people,
get it while it's hot.

41:14.689 --> 41:17.874
(knocking)
All right. Yo.

41:17.876 --> 41:19.459
What's going on? Just
in time. Hey, kiddo.

41:19.484 --> 41:20.761
Hey, everybody.

41:20.762 --> 41:22.128
Go get some of that
chili, all right,

41:22.130 --> 41:24.247
before those animals eat
the whole pot.

41:24.249 --> 41:25.832
Okay, Gracie?
That's it.

41:25.834 --> 41:27.550
Grab... Yeah, push...
Just push your way in.

41:27.552 --> 41:28.551
Don't be shy. Yeah.

41:28.553 --> 41:29.585
Where you going, sistah?

41:29.587 --> 41:31.087
Back off, <i>keiki.</i>

41:31.089 --> 41:32.038
Be careful, honey.
That's the most

41:32.040 --> 41:33.523
dangerous place
on the island,

41:33.525 --> 41:34.790
between those two
when there's food.

41:34.792 --> 41:36.476
There you go,
princess.

41:36.478 --> 41:37.727
Hey, how's Amber?

41:37.729 --> 41:39.729
Oh, she's, uh...
she's fantastic.

41:39.731 --> 41:42.064
Wow, a smile. You perked up
when I mentioned her name.

41:42.066 --> 41:43.316
What, you got a serious thing

41:43.318 --> 41:44.800
for this girl?

41:44.802 --> 41:46.436
No, I mean, I got...
I got a thing.

41:46.438 --> 41:47.737
I don't... I don't think
I perked up.

41:47.739 --> 41:48.988
You did perk up.
That's not...

41:48.990 --> 41:50.940
that's not what I do.
I don't perk up.

41:50.942 --> 41:52.125
Let me ask you
a question.

41:52.127 --> 41:53.526
What's, uh...
what's going on here?

41:53.528 --> 41:54.994
What are you talking about?

41:54.996 --> 41:57.363
Well, you know, first you invite
him over for Thanksgiving.

41:57.365 --> 41:59.665
Then you guys, uh...
you guys partner up.

41:59.667 --> 42:01.367
Now he's in the kitchen
cooking chili, watching

42:01.369 --> 42:03.369
the game. People are gonna think
you two like each other

42:03.371 --> 42:05.154
or something.
I don't know. H-He's not that bad.

42:05.156 --> 42:05.774
No?

42:05.799 --> 42:07.708
No, he's not that bad.
I mean, he's, uh...

42:07.709 --> 42:09.509
he's a bit...

42:09.511 --> 42:12.094
he's a bit thick-headed,
but he makes a great chili.

42:12.096 --> 42:14.163
Oh, that's good. So he's
like you, but he can cook.

42:15.182 --> 42:16.265
You want to eat?
Mm-hmm.

42:16.267 --> 42:17.600
You want to eat today?
Mm-hmm.

42:17.602 --> 42:18.834
Bruddah,

42:18.836 --> 42:20.353
I don't think it's chili

42:20.355 --> 42:21.587
unless you have Spam in it.

42:21.589 --> 42:23.055
GROVER:
Where I come from,

42:23.057 --> 42:24.624
Spam is a controlled substance.

42:24.626 --> 42:26.275
(laughter)

42:26.277 --> 42:27.510
Eat up. Here you go.

42:27.512 --> 42:28.711
Come on, folks.

42:28.713 --> 42:30.646
Dig in.
KONO: Mmm, that smells good.

42:32.449 --> 42:34.183
You guys got room for two more?

42:36.837 --> 42:38.821
Aloha.

42:45.245 --> 42:47.079
Hey.

42:47.081 --> 42:48.214
Welcome back.

42:48.216 --> 42:49.415
Thank you.

42:49.417 --> 42:51.700
It's good to be back.

42:51.702 --> 42:54.203
Thanks, man.

42:54.205 --> 42:57.056
(chuckles)
Welcome home.

43:03.564 --> 43:05.848
Hi.

43:05.850 --> 43:07.266
Did you get taller?

43:07.268 --> 43:09.218
(giggles)

43:09.220 --> 43:11.103
What's up, sistah?

43:13.907 --> 43:15.908
You know I missed you.

43:15.910 --> 43:18.110
Aw.

43:39.683 --> 43:42.552
It's good to be home.
