04:32.089 --> 04:33.255

Beshte, make sure
Hodari's okay.

14:51.474 --> 14:56.010
Now, let's go make sure
Kiburi's float really does
leave the Pride Lands.

14:57.314 --> 15:00.315
Hodari, what are you doing
with Kiburi and his crocs?

15:00.350 --> 15:03.251
Didn't you hear Kiburi?
I'm part of his float now.

15:03.386 --> 15:05.086
Why did you chase them away?

15:05.121 --> 15:08.323
'Cause Simba banished them
to the Outlands after they
tried to take him down.

15:08.358 --> 15:10.158
They're bad guys, Hodari.

15:10.193 --> 15:12.093
No! Kiburi was nice to me,

15:12.128 --> 15:13.227
and we were just
looking for water.

15:13.263 --> 15:16.197
Hodari, you gotta trust me
on this one.

15:16.232 --> 15:18.967
But you said I should join
a crocodile float.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.302
Now that I did,
you're saying I'm a bad guy?

15:21.338 --> 15:22.503
I'm not saying you're bad...

15:22.539 --> 15:26.307
Yes, you are. You said
I should follow my dreams,
and I did.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.309
Maybe you're not my friend
after all.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.211
No, Hodari! Wait!

15:35.085 --> 15:38.186
I thought the gecko was gonna
get us past the Lion Guard.

15:38.221 --> 15:40.421
At least he stalled 'em.
They looked confused.

15:41.191 --> 15:43.324
We just have to move fast
and take down Makuu

15:43.360 --> 15:46.394
before the Lion Guard
even knows
we're in the Pride Lands.

15:46.429 --> 15:48.329
Kiburi! Crocs!

15:48.365 --> 15:49.430
I'm back.

15:50.900 --> 15:54.235
Hodari? We thought maybe
you decided to stay
with your Lion Guard friends.

15:54.270 --> 15:57.271
They're not
my friends anymore.
I'm with your float now.

15:57.307 --> 16:00.241
Ooh. Like that's gonna
do us any good.

16:00.443 --> 16:02.276
It might. Watch.

16:02.979 --> 16:06.214
Hodari, you have so many
crocodile moves.

16:06.249 --> 16:09.117
You gotta tell us
everything you learned
from Makuu's float.

16:09.152 --> 16:10.418
Oh, wow. There's so much.

16:10.453 --> 16:12.420
You should see the new moves
they're working on.

16:12.455 --> 16:15.089
Like the Wide... Tailspin!

Most of the crocs can't
do it as good as me.

16:17.127 --> 16:20.294
Oh, and Makuu has been doing
this crazy new move.

16:21.364 --> 16:23.965
But I don't think
he can do that move.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.166
His front leg is hurt
pretty bad.

16:25.201 --> 16:28.269
Oh, oh, and there's
this move, too!

16:28.405 --> 16:30.271
But I don't think he can do
that one, either.

16:30.473 --> 16:32.173
Makuu's hurt?

16:32.208 --> 16:34.175
This will definitely
be useful.

16:34.444 --> 16:35.443
Useful for what?

heading your way earlier.
