they were normal, Shaun.

You need to do
your exercise routine,

01:02.463 --> 01:04.398
then shower, shave,
and get to work.

01:04.432 --> 01:06.033
And not because
your patients
need your help,

01:06.066 --> 01:07.835
but because it'll
make you feel better.

Your sleep apnea is worse
than we'd thought.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.584
You have a condition
related to your
pseudoachondroplasia

01:23.617 --> 01:25.286
that is narrowing
the base of your skull

01:25.319 --> 01:27.188
and compressing
the part of your brain

01:27.221 --> 01:28.489
that controls
your breathing.

I'm too full of myself.

DR. MELENDEZ:
We can remove bone
from the wall of your skull

01:41.502 --> 01:43.904
and resect a small section
of your cerebellum

01:43.937 --> 01:45.473
to reduce
brain-stem pressure.

01:45.506 --> 01:48.576
You're...
You're gonna cut out
a piece of his brain?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.744
It won't affect
your intellect,

01:50.778 --> 01:52.780
but it will cause
a speech impediment

01:52.813 --> 01:54.482
and some difficulty
with balance.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.185
I'd rather you knock
a few points off my IQ.

is what you love about me.

option two?

there is no other option.

another way.

You just got to think
outside the box.

(SIGHS)
We've already done that,

02:15.068 --> 02:16.904
which is how we came up
with this surgery.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.272
It's the only way
to keep you alive,

02:18.306 --> 02:19.907
so you have no choice
but to accept it.

02:21.542 --> 02:24.278
Dr. Murphy is being rude
and insensitive,

02:24.312 --> 02:25.613
but he's also right.

I love you.

be here for you

how you talk or walk.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.522
But you have to listen
to your doctors.

Let me guess.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.689
I'm gonna need
another surgery.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.624
What's that now,
my tenth?

03:10.658 --> 03:11.659
Eleventh.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.862
And I still can't
work the farm,

03:14.895 --> 03:18.832
can't drive a tractor,
pull a combine lever.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.168
I can't even
twist open a bottle of beer.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.803
When we met,
you were in an ambulance

03:22.836 --> 03:24.938
and your arms were still
in your harvester.

03:24.972 --> 03:28.342
Today you have sensation
and almost full mobility.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.210
Now we just need
to treat the neuropathy

03:30.244 --> 03:32.212
and improve
your strength.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.315
So how
do we do that?

03:34.348 --> 03:37.585
I'm thinking
a gracilis muscle
transfer.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.654
That should improve
his grip and relieve
some of the pain,

03:40.688 --> 03:43.657
but there's only one way
to eliminate all of it.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.327
Tyson, have you given
any more thought to amputation

03:46.360 --> 03:48.195
and osseointegrated
prosthetic arms?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.963
They'd attach
directly to the bones

03:49.997 --> 03:51.131
and nerves
in your forearm,

03:51.164 --> 03:53.200
and you can control them
just like your own hands.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.136
Function would be reduced
in some respects.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.373
Less dexterity,
no sensory feedback.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.875
But others,
like grip strength,
would be better.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.877
And more importantly,
you'd be pain-free.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.083
I want to be
a farmer,

04:10.117 --> 04:11.385
not a cyborg.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.787
Okay.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.758
The pain's
getting worse.

04:17.791 --> 04:20.861
Probably because I've been
crazy busy in the O.R.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.430
with Murphy out
till today.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.498
He's back?

04:24.532 --> 04:26.166
Only because Browne
went to his apartment

04:26.199 --> 04:27.200
and dragged his ass in.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.937
She shouldn't have
done that.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.539
He's trying to
work this out
on his own.

Which is why
I've been thinking about
synovectomy surgery.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.951
You're gonna remove
the joint linings
in your fingers?

04:43.984 --> 04:45.519
That'll resolve the pain
temporarily.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.587
Then what?

04:46.620 --> 04:48.489
It'll give me
at least ten years.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.659
And then you're gonna be
bone on bone,

04:51.692 --> 04:54.094
every joint in your hand
will be mangled and deformed.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.663
What's your plan then?

04:58.399 --> 05:02.202
Who knows what treatments
will be available
in ten years?

05:02.235 --> 05:03.671
Have you thought
about oncology?

05:04.638 --> 05:06.540
Surgeons do
the real work.

05:06.574 --> 05:09.142
They cut out the tumor,
they cure the patient.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.078
Oncologists just
sweep up after.

an even better job?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.982

05:15.015 --> 05:17.651
You want to know
why I didn't get that job?

05:17.685 --> 05:19.620
Because the scouts didn't like
the way you wore your hat?

05:19.653 --> 05:22.556
Yeah, that,
and I was born
with this arm.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.257
You were born
with those hands.

05:25.493 --> 05:27.160

for a few more years

the rest of your life

10:00.067 --> 10:02.202
a bacteria-rich
environment,

10:02.235 --> 10:03.637
which can't be
fully sterilized.

10:03.671 --> 10:05.706
There would be too high a risk
of a post-op brain infection.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.174
So we figure out
another approach.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.843
There's only one safe way
to access the C2.

10:09.877 --> 10:12.880
Okay, so come up
with something
outside the box.

10:12.913 --> 10:15.215
No, that's
a stupid expression.
There is no box.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.550
And you are wasting
valuable time

10:17.584 --> 10:19.586
just because
you want to be nice to her.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.021

10:25.225 --> 10:26.493
I'm not being nice.

10:26.526 --> 10:28.762
I'm using my experience
and judgment to make the call.

10:28.796 --> 10:29.863
That's my job.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.932
You are being nice.
And you're being a jerk.

with a solution by morning,

10:40.974 --> 10:42.776
we'll proceed
with the original plan.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.062
Your patient's
in desperate need

11:02.095 --> 11:03.596

weather report?

11:03.630 --> 11:05.799
I didn't even want
to be here today.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.771
You should try
a martial arts class.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.707
Focused distraction is key
to dealing with stress

11:13.741 --> 11:15.542
and heartbreaks.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.510
That's just
avoiding the problem.

Don't obsess over
what you've lost,

11:19.379 --> 11:21.381

from the relationship.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.083
CLAIRE: I hate to interrupt
group therapy,

11:23.116 --> 11:25.185
but what if
we approached

11:25.218 --> 11:26.720
through the side
of the neck?

11:26.754 --> 11:28.856
We could transpose
the vertebral artery,

11:28.889 --> 11:31.324
open up the spine laterally
to drill off the C2.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.360
It would leave his spine
permanently unstable

11:33.393 --> 11:34.694
and could cause
a stroke.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.964
There might be a way
to mitigate stroke risk.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.665
And he'd still have
the instability and...

11:38.698 --> 11:40.300
Come on, Shaun.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.869

not criticism.

supported you

to come up with

11:46.673 --> 11:47.841

from his upper arm

12:11.932 --> 12:13.000

his forearms.

12:13.033 --> 12:14.167
It'll improve his grip,

12:14.201 --> 12:15.602
and with
the scar tissue removed,

12:15.635 --> 12:17.037
the pain
should decrease, too.

the blood-flow problem

12:19.272 --> 12:20.540

the scarring.

I'm sure we can come up
with a solve for that.

you said last time.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.880

give us a moment?

so against the prosthetics

Tyson's best interest,

12:40.760 --> 12:41.761
or because
it's my idea?

12:43.964 --> 12:46.533
You think I care
whose idea anything is?

12:46.566 --> 12:48.435
You're a competitive person

12:48.468 --> 12:50.537
working with the guy
who used to hold your job.

12:52.539 --> 12:56.276
I'll admit
my competitive drive
may kick up a notch

12:56.309 --> 12:57.811
when we work together.

12:57.845 --> 13:01.281
I'll also admit
that I admire the courage

13:01.314 --> 13:03.984
of a guy who stumbled
a half-mile back to his house

13:04.017 --> 13:06.719
after his arms
were ripped off
by a combine.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.655
He opened a door
with his mouth

13:08.688 --> 13:10.824
and dialed 911
with his nose,

13:10.858 --> 13:12.559
and as long as he wants
to keep fighting,

13:12.592 --> 13:14.461
I'm gonna fight
along with him.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.496
Which has nothing to do
with my ego.

13:17.497 --> 13:18.765
Good.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.267
That's all
I wanted to confirm.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.437
But I'm gonna start prepping
for the amputation

13:24.471 --> 13:26.907
because that's the only
rational choice we have,

13:26.940 --> 13:28.775

you'll realize soon enough.

leave his spine unstable

and increase his risk
of stroke.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.799

How did it go?

34:20.459 --> 34:22.228
Can you lift your arms
for me?

34:29.768 --> 34:32.504
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

34:32.538 --> 34:33.739
Okay.

34:35.073 --> 34:38.009
I'm gonna push your arm,
and I need you to resist.

34:40.846 --> 34:42.248
Good. More.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.583
Stronger. (CHUCKLES)

34:44.616 --> 34:46.051
That's great.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.220
You should make
a full recovery.

34:48.254 --> 34:49.321
Thank you.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.558
H-How's Nathalie's hand?

34:52.591 --> 34:55.627
There was no nerve
or tendon damage.

34:55.661 --> 34:56.928
She'll be fine.

34:56.962 --> 34:58.764
She's a good person.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.399
A little spirited,

35:00.432 --> 35:02.301
but that's what I loved
about her.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.772
Are you going to try
to win her back?

35:08.607 --> 35:11.410
I'm confident
but not stupid.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.579
You gotta know
when to call it,
Dr. Murphy.

35:16.081 --> 35:17.649
(CHUCKLES)

35:17.683 --> 35:19.318
I mean,
there's a-a whole world

35:19.351 --> 35:21.787
of amazing people
out there.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.956
Don't get bogged down with
this notion of a soulmate.

35:29.295 --> 35:31.263
(DOOR OPENS)

35:31.297 --> 35:33.799
Finn's exam was normal.

35:36.134 --> 35:39.238
But I am not sure
it was worth the risk.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.741
We did
a good thing today.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.910
Mostly because of you.

35:44.943 --> 35:47.779
That's kind of you
to say but...

35:49.448 --> 35:51.350
Your commitment
to your patients

35:53.319 --> 35:54.920
reminds me of why
I got into medicine.

35:57.556 --> 36:00.859
Being around you
makes me a better surgeon.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.297
A better person.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.304
Well, good night.

36:12.338 --> 36:13.372
Good night.

36:13.405 --> 36:16.107
**

36:27.018 --> 36:28.720
You did
good work today.

36:30.989 --> 36:32.858
And I understand
you're leaving surgery.

36:34.159 --> 36:36.795
And I know that's a...
That's tough.

36:36.828 --> 36:38.129
But it's
the right call.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.403
No, I don't think it is.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.276
I love operating.

36:50.309 --> 36:52.611
So I'm gonna keep doing it
as long as I can.

36:55.847 --> 36:58.417
I'm gonna have
the synovectomy surgery.

37:00.619 --> 37:01.920
That's really stupid.

37:02.888 --> 37:05.156
That's incredibly stupid.

37:07.092 --> 37:09.528
Not every dream
comes true.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.297
You have
other opportunities.

37:11.330 --> 37:12.864
You have another chance.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.166
Not everybody does.
Be grateful for that.

37:15.200 --> 37:18.036
Pick another passion
and pursue that.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.340
**

37:21.373 --> 37:23.208
I'm doing the surgery.

37:43.729 --> 37:44.730
Enjoy.

37:48.667 --> 37:49.968
Another, please.

37:53.238 --> 37:55.874
Well, that's one way
to start the night off right.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.543
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

37:57.576 --> 38:00.211
Hello, Nurse Fletch.

38:00.245 --> 38:01.780
You can
call me Julie.

38:03.214 --> 38:06.051
Are you here alone,
or are you meeting someone?

38:06.084 --> 38:07.886
I'm alone.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.087
Well, to us.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.090

38:17.996 --> 38:19.431
You have
beautiful eyes.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.801
Thank you.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.607
Or did someone
just tell you that

38:28.640 --> 38:30.409
that's a good
opening line?

38:37.483 --> 38:38.617
It's right
in our backyard,

38:38.650 --> 38:39.951
and I've never
even been there.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.753
Have you?
CLAIRE: No.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.255
It's, uh, time we unleash
our inner tree-hugger.

38:46.257 --> 38:47.559
You're off next weekend.

38:47.593 --> 38:48.760
I think we should
go to Yosemite.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.161
What do you think?

38:50.195 --> 38:51.262
Yeah, sounds fun.

38:51.296 --> 38:52.964
I need to get me
some hiking boots.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.633
Mm.
And, uh, like a fleece.

38:54.666 --> 38:55.967
Mm-hmm.
Beanie.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.103
Mm.
I'm rocking the full
lumbersexual look.

38:58.136 --> 38:59.571

'Cause I gotta blend in.

38:59.605 --> 39:02.608

a tourist a mile away.

39:03.308 --> 39:04.976
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

39:07.813 --> 39:08.814
You okay?

39:10.048 --> 39:12.350
Uh, you're, uh...

39:12.384 --> 39:15.487
You're here,
but, you know, not.

39:17.989 --> 39:19.124
You're right.
I'm sorry.

39:19.157 --> 39:21.159
It's... It's just been
a long week.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.661
I'm a bit exhausted.

39:24.029 --> 39:27.399
Yeah, I think
I might call it
an early night.

39:28.534 --> 39:29.835
Oh, you sure?

39:29.868 --> 39:32.203
I... You know,
we don't have to
go to the club.

39:32.237 --> 39:34.172
We can chill here.
We can watch a movie.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.273
I'm sorry.

39:35.306 --> 39:36.975
I just...

39:37.008 --> 39:38.510
I just think
I should go home.

that's a bad idea.
