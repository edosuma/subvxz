- The demon's jaw crunching.

00:13.170 --> 00:15.110
Man's head is full of fairytales.

00:15.955 --> 00:19.666
The victim was assaulted,
murdered and decapitated.

00:19.763 --> 00:22.349
I'm not leaving my home and
that's what the doctor will do.

00:23.950 --> 00:25.601
He punched Hildur Odegard.

00:25.636 --> 00:27.470
Michael Lennox! Your boat!

00:28.177 --> 00:32.200
Three hundred thousand tons
of ice and snow buried forever.

00:32.235 --> 00:33.528
We're just clinging on.

00:33.563 --> 00:34.819
Dan?

02:34.795 --> 02:37.630
Dan has acute alcoholic poisoning.

02:37.771 --> 02:41.650
Traces of ethylene glycol
still in his blood, antifreeze,

02:41.730 --> 02:46.667
coolant, can't be sure... that's
why we have him on dialysis.

02:46.771 --> 02:50.291
There's renal failure,
cardiovascular compromise.

02:50.974 --> 02:54.414
In your opinion, the
condition you see him in now...

02:55.495 --> 02:56.872
would he have been capable of...

02:56.925 --> 03:00.543
strenuous physical activity
in the last twenty four hours?

03:02.227 --> 03:04.646
I'm surprised he could even walk.

03:12.036 --> 03:18.034
How did he survive all that time and
we never saw him, heard him? Nobody.

03:19.789 --> 03:22.749
Could he have anything
to do with the dead man?

03:25.203 --> 03:26.436
I'll find out.

03:52.150 --> 03:55.295
- How is she?
- Afloat.

03:57.906 --> 04:03.258
It's horrible. It's like an
assault on somebody you love.

04:03.293 --> 04:05.922
Probably get the wiring done today.

04:06.026 --> 04:09.425
Patch up the rest tomorrow
and Saul's got cable he can...

04:09.467 --> 04:12.094
- Michael.
- Pick up a finder second hand.

04:12.129 --> 04:14.425
There's no money for a finder.

04:15.685 --> 04:20.885
Every boat in the fleet is out
there, using that data, my data.

04:20.920 --> 04:22.005
Hauling in money.

04:22.091 --> 04:23.839
The Muriel's finished.

04:25.715 --> 04:27.747
I'll be on the crab by the weekend.

04:27.785 --> 04:31.583
Michael. Baby. You have to
start facing up to reality.

04:36.972 --> 04:38.183
I am.

04:40.860 --> 04:42.120
You okay?

04:45.470 --> 04:50.342
Mum. Listen. Anything unusual...
Or anybody around who shouldn't

04:50.415 --> 04:53.260
be out here, let me know. Okay? Call me.

04:54.228 --> 04:56.116
So that man was murdered then.

04:56.176 --> 04:57.455
Just call me.

05:04.072 --> 05:06.966
Eric? This thing wasn't bent out of shape.

05:07.001 --> 05:09.548
It's supposed to be like this.
It's called a wrecker bar.

05:09.589 --> 05:10.616
Geologists use them.

05:10.682 --> 05:12.644
FARC said only one of their
researchers has one like this.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.354
It's a German make.

05:14.389 --> 05:16.780
Laszlo Hindemith. Arrived here last month.

05:16.825 --> 05:19.021
Connecting flight from Kinshasa.

05:19.069 --> 05:22.749
He rents a place out on the
airport road. Five, Amundsunveien.

05:22.830 --> 05:23.928
So let's go...

05:28.393 --> 05:32.180
Hindemith works at the geology
department at FARC, but he's not

05:32.215 --> 05:33.783
affliated to the centre.

05:33.828 --> 05:37.657
He is an independent researcher.
Freelance, no colleagues.

05:37.692 --> 05:39.172
What was he researching?

05:39.335 --> 05:40.703
Nobody knows.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.442
Mr. Hindemith! Fortitude Police!

05:54.126 --> 05:56.588
I could probably get in
through the kitchen window...

06:05.738 --> 06:07.249
Mr. Hindemith!

06:21.607 --> 06:23.047
There's nobody home.

06:23.648 --> 06:25.608
He's been living here a month.

06:37.852 --> 06:39.212
Eric?

06:42.101 --> 06:45.541
Aruwamo. I think that's
where Hindemith was based.

06:45.641 --> 06:47.081
The Congo.

06:48.900 --> 06:56.886
Mustard. Mustard and chilli
sauce. And no hotdogs.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.230
Hot spices and condiments.

06:59.664 --> 07:02.618
This kind of food can
be a sign of depression.

07:02.717 --> 07:05.837
People need the kick it
gives them to feel alive.

07:25.132 --> 07:27.299
He was taking animal sedative.

07:45.181 --> 07:46.451
Anything else?

07:46.503 --> 07:50.103
What? No... Just drugs...

07:50.138 --> 07:52.529
Lots of drugs. Yeah.

07:52.591 --> 07:55.231
Prints and swabs, then we can bag it all.

08:15.555 --> 08:17.218
Don't go in today.

08:24.827 --> 08:29.867
I have a date... with a
hermaphroditic reindeer foetus.

08:32.315 --> 08:33.914
So I'm chucked.

08:33.986 --> 08:35.760
You are so chucked.

08:37.437 --> 08:40.760
Thought you were done with
those biopsies. The reindeer...

08:40.827 --> 08:43.428
Thought you had ran out of little foetuses.

08:44.699 --> 08:45.926
Few left.

09:23.659 --> 09:26.833
I saw absolutely no behavioural
changes in the first rat.

09:26.903 --> 09:29.583
When the larvae matured
inside, the rat simply died.

09:29.618 --> 09:32.398
The larvae feasted on the rat's tissues.

09:32.464 --> 09:34.719
Standard parasitical wasp outcome.

09:34.764 --> 09:36.648
Perhaps the wasps function as a vector.

09:36.683 --> 09:40.328
Like mosquitoes and malaria,
deer tick and Lyme's disease,

09:40.394 --> 09:42.540
sand fly and Oncochersiasis.

09:42.575 --> 09:43.622
Oncochersiasis?

09:43.657 --> 09:46.966
A sandfly gouges a wound in the
victims flesh in order to feed

09:47.001 --> 09:49.878
the parasitic roundworm forces
its way out of the sandfly's

09:49.913 --> 09:52.423
head into the victim's blood.

09:52.459 --> 09:55.441
Result... river blindness.

09:55.494 --> 09:58.774
There's just no nice way
to be a parasite, is there?

09:58.936 --> 09:59.888
How do you mean?

09:59.969 --> 10:03.269
- I'm being facetious.
- Oh, I see.

10:03.723 --> 10:06.379
The wasp I brought down
from the glacier is clean.

10:07.031 --> 10:11.071
It's not a vector for anything
horrific. It's just... a wasp.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.786
- It's a nasty little syringe with nothing in it.
- Yes.

10:14.821 --> 10:17.923
Then we can declare an all-clear.
We can start telling people this.

10:19.221 --> 10:21.048
That would be... injudicious.

10:21.083 --> 10:22.270
Injudicious?

10:22.305 --> 10:24.728
Precipitatous. Premature. Ill-advised.

10:25.252 --> 10:27.011
That's a "no", isn't it?

10:29.141 --> 10:31.472
You might think I'm not smiling
at these occasional witticisms

10:31.507 --> 10:33.547
because I'm humourless.

10:33.644 --> 10:36.022
You might think that,
Natalie, but you'd be wrong.

10:37.003 --> 10:39.593
I'm not smiling much at all these
days because everything about

10:39.660 --> 10:42.845
this place has me shitting my
pants in expectation of some

10:42.911 --> 10:45.355
hurtling environmental catastrophe.

10:48.183 --> 10:49.372
Boom boom.

11:01.019 --> 11:03.182
Ow, fuck!

11:16.019 --> 11:18.319
You can't take this boat out there.

11:18.383 --> 11:21.903
The fire did us a favour.
Just collect the insurance.

11:22.564 --> 11:24.249
Make the best of it.

11:24.298 --> 11:25.778
There is no insurance.

11:27.325 --> 11:28.925
'Course there is.

11:29.214 --> 11:31.529
Michael.

11:31.564 --> 11:32.843
It's gone.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.139
You didn't tell me.

11:36.403 --> 11:38.626
What would it matter
if I told you or not...?

11:46.686 --> 11:48.326
Lamont...?

11:53.500 --> 11:55.980
I couldn't let you go out there alone.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.366
We both know what the seas
are like this time of year.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.058
Get the fuck off my boat.

12:01.967 --> 12:04.234
The Muriel wouldn't have made it back...

12:04.290 --> 12:07.170
Get the fuck off my boat!

12:09.771 --> 12:14.537
I need to speak to Rune
straight away. Rune Lennox...

12:14.611 --> 12:18.051
Fortitude police need to
ask him some questions...

12:25.467 --> 12:27.277
Is he in some kind of trouble?

12:27.611 --> 12:29.091
No... I need to ask...

12:29.165 --> 12:32.021
What's the flight time
from Kinshasha to Oslo?

12:32.056 --> 12:32.638
What?

12:32.673 --> 12:35.953
Would Hindemith fly in
from the D.R.C via Schiphol?

12:35.988 --> 12:38.508
Err? I'll find out.

12:41.451 --> 12:42.955
Who's that, what's going on?

12:42.990 --> 12:47.075
Nothing. I'll check
the flights for you now.

13:01.118 --> 13:09.831
Now I know I've got to run away.

13:10.693 --> 13:19.103
I've got to get away, you don't
really want any more from me,

13:19.200 --> 13:27.520
to make things right, you
need someone to hold you tight.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.599
I'm not convinced this
is a suitable environment.

13:30.634 --> 13:33.114
It's the only suitable environment.

13:33.360 --> 13:35.609
She'd be more comfortable in my hospital.

13:35.644 --> 13:37.573
Until the patient has been determined to be

13:37.608 --> 13:40.492
pathogenically sterile, then it is
my responsibility to contain her.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.527
Isn't that right, Governor Odegard?

13:43.646 --> 13:46.966
The specialist committee from the
mainland agreed this arrangement.

13:47.001 --> 13:48.121
Yes.

13:49.044 --> 13:51.084
You think this is acceptable?

13:51.756 --> 13:54.785
Keeping the girl like
a rat in a Perspex box?

13:54.820 --> 13:59.300
The subject is in an irreversible
vegetative comatose condition.

13:59.335 --> 14:03.104
I'm sorry, governor, had I been
part of that conversation, I would

14:03.185 --> 14:05.025
never have agreed to do this.

14:12.301 --> 14:13.501
Maybe he's right.

14:13.536 --> 14:17.365
Here, she contributes.
Her sacrifice has meaning.

14:17.441 --> 14:20.081
What we learn from her may yet save lives.

14:24.691 --> 14:28.268
Doctor. Governor.

14:31.804 --> 14:35.164
And her existence is not
without some stimulation.

15:41.548 --> 15:42.910
Fortitude police.

15:42.974 --> 15:44.608
It's Michael Lennox.

15:45.179 --> 15:48.727
I just saw a flare go up
near Matti's husky pen.

15:48.913 --> 15:52.513
It's a reindeer. We're four
months too early for bear.

15:52.605 --> 15:55.430
I know, but it's still
gotta be logged, Eric!

15:55.465 --> 15:58.776
Michael, you see Matti, you
tell him, frankly I've more

15:58.811 --> 16:00.629
important shit to worry about.

16:07.994 --> 16:09.907
I did what I could for you Hildur.

16:09.981 --> 16:12.511
But they were always going to get you.

16:13.554 --> 16:14.754
What is this?

16:14.789 --> 16:19.655
You gave them their excuse.
You'd loaded the gun yourself.

16:19.690 --> 16:22.451
What gun? What, what are you talking about?

16:22.516 --> 16:26.008
In direct contravention of
express instructions from

16:26.097 --> 16:27.728
minister himself.

16:28.118 --> 16:31.240
You released fuel subsidies.

16:31.315 --> 16:34.760
Yes, I know... but I, I had to do that.

16:34.795 --> 16:36.681
Without authorisation.

16:36.716 --> 16:39.380
The fleet had to have fuel.

16:39.465 --> 16:42.497
I told you this would never
work on the ground, Erling, Oslo

16:42.564 --> 16:44.414
always trying to second guess...

16:44.465 --> 16:48.039
You're right. It didn't work.

16:48.106 --> 16:52.106
The idea of prosecution was
mooted. Criminal prosecution.

16:52.627 --> 16:55.369
Misappropriation of governmental...

16:55.404 --> 16:59.225
you know the kind of shit they
can cook up without even blinking.

16:59.225 --> 17:00.434
Who's behind this?

17:00.469 --> 17:02.229
They all are.

17:06.362 --> 17:08.714
Termination of appointment.

17:10.354 --> 17:14.354
You will be given time within
reason to clear your desk and to

17:14.425 --> 17:16.816
make interim arrangements.

17:17.874 --> 17:22.113
I will be in charge during
the transitional period.

17:22.147 --> 17:25.434
Until a new appointment is made.

17:27.594 --> 17:28.990
New appointment.

17:30.187 --> 17:37.067
As of this time, you are no
longer the governor of Fortitude.

17:44.075 --> 17:48.715
I'll check into my room.
Give you time to take this in.

18:11.632 --> 18:12.672
Hey.

18:13.980 --> 18:21.823
Hi, mum. Rune's been
messing around with a girl.

18:23.187 --> 18:25.067
Of course he has.

18:25.194 --> 18:26.496
Do you know her?

18:26.531 --> 18:30.678
I know she's gorgeous and
she's a bit older than him.

18:30.713 --> 18:33.627
And she's from Vukobejina.

18:34.562 --> 18:35.922
Do you know her name?

18:36.740 --> 18:39.577
They don't use names when they text.

18:41.026 --> 18:42.625
You read his texts?

18:42.660 --> 18:48.185
No, Ingrid. I read their minds
using my special psychic powers.

18:50.076 --> 18:51.996
I have to find her.

18:54.110 --> 18:55.470
Are they in trouble?

18:55.614 --> 18:56.724
No.

18:58.789 --> 19:04.629
They always meet in the MS. I'm
assuming it stands for Midnight Sun.

19:13.740 --> 19:19.181
Laszlo Hindemith. Geologist.
Recently arrived at the, err,

19:19.260 --> 19:20.558
Research Centre.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.160
Anyone know Mr. Hindemith?

19:22.233 --> 19:25.153
- That the headless human being, Eric?
- You know him?

19:25.188 --> 19:28.513
You said it was not my
plough that took his head off.

19:28.548 --> 19:29.708
It was a clean cut.

19:29.743 --> 19:33.336
It wasn't your plough, Lars.
Forensics established that.

19:35.433 --> 19:36.652
Forensics.

19:36.687 --> 19:39.327
You mean Petra and her eyebrow tweezers.

19:40.104 --> 19:43.772
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying...

19:44.426 --> 19:48.720
if it was a clean cut, then
it was a blade of some kind.

19:49.896 --> 19:52.394
Means he was murdered. That right?

19:52.429 --> 19:53.895
This is a road accident.

19:54.328 --> 19:56.412
Two days ago, you were hiding up a glacier.

19:56.481 --> 19:58.881
How the fuck did you get to be sheriff?

19:59.740 --> 20:00.846
Sit down, Lamont.

20:00.881 --> 20:02.597
- Don't tell me to sit down.
- Sit down.

20:02.668 --> 20:03.869
Answer the fucking question.

20:03.904 --> 20:06.064
Sit. Down.

20:08.655 --> 20:10.295
I knew Laszlo Hindemith.

20:11.768 --> 20:13.288
What?

20:13.323 --> 20:20.523
Hindemith. He comes in here when
the place is quiet. Drinks scotch.

20:20.575 --> 20:21.815
Lots of it.

20:23.953 --> 20:25.401
What do you know about him?

20:26.359 --> 20:27.599
Talks a lot.

20:28.001 --> 20:32.214
- What about?
- The "demoniacal cacophony" he said.

20:33.060 --> 20:37.894
"Childrens' voices". They
die in the hands of cannibals.

20:37.968 --> 20:40.368
"The demon's jaws".

20:40.403 --> 20:41.507
Stuff like that.

20:41.709 --> 20:44.699
Permit me to corroborate the
barman's account of things.

20:44.734 --> 20:51.532
Demons and Cannibals. But I'm sure
you have contingency plans. Hmm?

20:52.375 --> 20:54.095
Just like last time.

21:23.280 --> 21:24.817
All the time you were gone, Dan.

21:24.852 --> 21:28.359
I prayed that Eric would
find you and bring you home.

21:29.770 --> 21:33.760
Those terrible events... we,
we wouldn't have survived them

21:33.795 --> 21:35.202
without you.

21:39.593 --> 21:42.054
I don't know if you even know I'm here.

21:43.512 --> 21:45.659
Know it's me talking to you.

21:51.800 --> 21:54.000
You remember...?

21:54.035 --> 21:59.146
Do you remember the little
model I had made, the ice hotel?

21:59.255 --> 22:03.744
Little lights inside. You laughed at me.

22:03.823 --> 22:10.610
You said I was like a princess
with a doll's house... and I was

22:10.671 --> 22:14.071
all tight-lipped but, you were right.

22:16.855 --> 22:18.702
Teeny little lights.

22:25.608 --> 22:28.310
Elena didn't die the night you shot her.

22:29.704 --> 22:32.231
She hasn't woken up since that night.

22:33.504 --> 22:38.486
She's in a special unit,
inside FARC, on life support.

22:40.059 --> 22:42.351
They don't think there's any
chance she's ever going...

22:49.940 --> 22:50.755
Dan.

22:55.151 --> 22:56.071
Dan!

22:57.975 --> 23:00.359
Help! Someone help!

23:00.420 --> 23:03.140
I need some assistance
here! Oxygen and lorazepam!

23:03.175 --> 23:04.935
Move away from the patient.

23:05.592 --> 23:08.340
He's in seizure. Try it on. Quickly.

23:09.385 --> 23:10.480
Go ahead.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.160
Hey! Wait!

23:50.583 --> 23:52.378
Stop or I'll shoot...!

23:52.993 --> 23:54.330
Shoot you!

24:10.688 --> 24:12.899
I'm Rune Lennox's big sister.

24:13.707 --> 24:15.307
I know.

24:15.401 --> 24:18.906
I found this in Laszlo
Hindemith's house. In his room.

24:18.946 --> 24:21.739
And his room was full of fucking drugs.

24:22.888 --> 24:24.528
Never been in his house.

24:24.701 --> 24:27.967
Don't tell lies. Is Rune doing heroin?

24:28.017 --> 24:30.165
- No.
- Don't lie to me!

24:30.507 --> 24:33.766
Hit me again and I will
fucking garrote you.

24:36.818 --> 24:44.458
Okay. Okay. Just... tell
me this. Two nights ago.

24:44.576 --> 24:49.896
Were you and Rune with Hindemith?
Is Rune involved in what happened?

24:52.375 --> 24:53.762
Please.

24:56.008 --> 24:58.797
You can't arrest me.

25:01.528 --> 25:05.105
You can't do anything to me
without getting him in trouble too.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.850
Hey, wait. Please.

25:14.185 --> 25:17.385
Why were you and Rune
stealing all those carrots?

25:22.217 --> 25:24.209
Bad things come at night.

25:27.003 --> 25:32.849
You need to be ready; you
need to see what's coming.

25:38.072 --> 25:41.101
The princess lay in the coffin of glass.

25:41.616 --> 25:45.308
Dead to the world till the end of time.

25:45.368 --> 25:50.130
And no one cared. No one remembered her.

25:50.207 --> 25:55.973
The sound of her voice,
her laughter. No one at all.

25:57.632 --> 25:59.122
The end.

26:05.952 --> 26:07.951
Poor Snow White.

27:29.121 --> 27:32.801
Hey what's going on? Hey. What's happening?

27:32.836 --> 27:34.957
There's a bear.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.140
Where... the playground?

27:36.175 --> 27:37.455
No. Inside.

27:37.524 --> 27:38.455
Inside?

27:38.455 --> 27:39.464
Yes.

27:41.815 --> 27:43.095
Mr. Huseklepp...?

27:43.095 --> 27:44.008
Yeah.

27:44.060 --> 27:45.931
Harald's not here.

27:45.966 --> 27:48.379
What do you mean, he's not
here? I saw him with us!

27:48.414 --> 27:50.923
Hey. You know it's okay.
No one's angry with you.

27:50.958 --> 27:52.364
Where did you see him?

27:52.433 --> 27:56.833
He went to get Princess.
He said bears eat rats.

28:01.847 --> 28:02.746
Give me the rifle.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.175
- No.
- Give me the damn rifle!

28:04.223 --> 28:07.660
Look, you stay here.
These kids, they need you.

28:07.742 --> 28:08.817
Alright?

28:11.145 --> 28:12.873
Have you been drinking?

28:12.908 --> 28:13.649
You're not fit to be around
my children if you're...

28:13.684 --> 28:17.828
Hey. If you wanna wait for
the police, go ahead, call 'em!

28:17.863 --> 28:21.623
Call Eric. Go on, call him.

28:21.695 --> 28:23.687
I don't think he's coming very soon.

30:44.670 --> 30:47.815
Bears don't come into town
here unless they're starving.

30:47.928 --> 30:49.648
Really desperate.

30:49.750 --> 30:51.464
Certainly not in daylight.

30:51.530 --> 30:54.655
And even if they are crazy with
hunger, they don't enter buildings.

30:54.690 --> 31:00.731
They just don't do that.
Look at its eyes. They're red.

31:00.766 --> 31:05.722
Inflamed. Possibly this bear
was infected with something.

31:05.757 --> 31:08.142
That's hemorrhaging from the head-shot.

31:08.208 --> 31:09.568
Maybe.

31:12.570 --> 31:18.397
This bear isn't starving. It
isn't even fucking peckish.

31:19.690 --> 31:24.010
So this is a typical
predator behaviour. Again.

31:26.090 --> 31:31.415
Vincent. This isn't it happening again,
this isn't what your so frightened of.

31:31.450 --> 31:34.793
I know what you think. This isn't it!

31:34.828 --> 31:36.250
What?

31:36.250 --> 31:38.642
Tell me what you think it is I think.

31:40.473 --> 31:41.950
Wasps.

31:46.210 --> 31:47.852
I know all about wasps.

31:47.887 --> 31:49.770
And you know they're all gone.

31:49.770 --> 31:53.370
- Do I?
- We'll never see them again. Chance in a trillion.

31:53.370 --> 31:57.090
You two brought the roof down on
the glacier cavern and that was that.

31:57.144 --> 31:58.864
No more wasps.

32:00.236 --> 32:02.239
As for this bear,

32:02.345 --> 32:05.477
you can't tell aberrant
behaviour from stomach contents.

32:05.842 --> 32:08.002
I think you need to find a live one.

32:18.097 --> 32:26.290
Yes. No. I, I understand. It's
just... I've been calling all day.

32:26.351 --> 32:29.415
But I'll try again tomorrow.

32:29.495 --> 32:32.927
Maybe the minister will have
time to speak in the morning.

32:40.701 --> 32:42.423
She is not up there.

32:42.491 --> 32:44.582
And who, may I ask, are you?

32:44.617 --> 32:46.244
I'm here to help.

32:46.279 --> 32:49.770
You can't help me, my
business is with the Governor.

32:49.805 --> 32:54.170
I am officially authorised to
expedite gubernatorial concerns.

32:54.318 --> 32:55.496
"Gubernatorial".

32:57.595 --> 33:00.699
I'm sorry, my time is spent
in the corridors of power in

33:00.734 --> 33:05.398
Oslo, and um, we often employ
language which must seem to be

33:05.433 --> 33:08.713
a quaint and hermetic.

33:12.050 --> 33:14.145
Get out of my way, you ridiculous man.

33:14.175 --> 33:17.104
Oi, oi, oi, where the fuck
do you think your going?

33:17.139 --> 33:22.187
You were not here! The authorities
lost control of everything!

33:22.222 --> 33:26.616
People died, and now people are
dying again and what the fuck are

33:26.651 --> 33:28.148
they doing about it?!

33:28.183 --> 33:29.699
You're not going up there!

33:34.530 --> 33:39.018
- Hello!
- Hildur, can you come down and take a look at this?

33:39.053 --> 33:41.117
I'll be down in five minutes.

33:46.210 --> 33:49.350
Nine years he worked out there
and the conditions in the Congo

33:49.385 --> 33:50.896
were truly hellish.

33:50.931 --> 33:55.121
Warlords being financed by
multi-national mineral companies.

33:55.156 --> 33:58.717
Hindemith in the middle of all this.

33:58.752 --> 34:05.380
They excavate enormous mountains
of mud, they use little children

34:05.415 --> 34:08.376
and they find diamonds,
called blood diamonds.

34:08.455 --> 34:13.935
Rubies, emeralds, valuable
rare earth metals like coltan...

34:13.969 --> 34:15.570
Where does this take us?

34:15.570 --> 34:19.347
All of this activity, most
of this activity, involves

34:19.402 --> 34:20.967
unspeakable suffering.

34:21.038 --> 34:25.495
Child labour, mass executions,
there are reports of cannibalism.

34:25.530 --> 34:26.589
Eric I, I don't see...

34:26.667 --> 34:29.467
The barman says he spoke of it.

34:29.610 --> 34:30.411
Hindemith?

34:30.446 --> 34:31.732
All the time.

34:33.449 --> 34:35.090
So...?

34:35.181 --> 34:41.610
I think he witnessed things that
haunted him. Terrible things.

34:41.668 --> 34:46.215
- And...?
- They sent someone here to kill him. To silence him.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.449
Who did?

34:47.536 --> 34:49.096
These people.

34:56.570 --> 34:59.922
So who cut the spine out of the husky?

35:01.972 --> 35:04.010
That could have been a warning.

35:04.228 --> 35:07.010
They sent him a warning after
they cut off his head off?

35:07.064 --> 35:09.048
I'm trying to build a profile of the crime.

35:09.083 --> 35:10.308
This isn't how it's done.

35:10.371 --> 35:12.653
- I'm trying.
- I know you're trying!

35:22.958 --> 35:24.770
I have to tell you something.

35:24.770 --> 35:26.010
What?

35:36.707 --> 35:38.071
I can't come home tonight.

35:38.106 --> 35:41.761
I have so much to do,
I'll sleep in the office.

36:04.484 --> 36:07.161
Oh. Don't turn on the light.

36:10.326 --> 36:13.764
Where were you? Been phoning.

36:15.446 --> 36:18.279
Stuff happened in the school.

36:18.314 --> 36:19.651
What stuff?

36:20.250 --> 36:21.386
Come here.

36:31.810 --> 36:36.190
How are you? Mmm? You okay?

36:37.896 --> 36:44.010
I have, erm... I'm having
a little trouble swallowing.

36:48.652 --> 36:50.154
- There is a clinic...
- No clinic...

36:50.236 --> 36:52.132
No, don't. Shh. No, no, no.

36:55.290 --> 37:02.610
I am going to sell the
Muriel for scrap. To Bergson.

37:02.702 --> 37:06.605
Fifty thousand maybe.
This place that I've found

37:06.640 --> 37:09.317
as a treatment that I read all about...

37:09.390 --> 37:10.417
- It's a fraud.
- Hey...

37:10.452 --> 37:16.818
No. There's testimonials from
people... people who've got better.

37:16.853 --> 37:20.329
It's the one thing they
know for sure, honey.

37:20.364 --> 37:24.748
Nothing has ever slowed this down
or changed its course in anyone.

37:24.783 --> 37:26.811
It's scientific...

37:29.137 --> 37:35.010
The worst thing we could
do... is lie to ourselves.

37:50.095 --> 37:52.815
They are taking everything away from us.

37:53.146 --> 37:57.725
Everything. And this is how it starts.

37:59.619 --> 38:02.729
I am no longer governor of Fortitude.

38:14.679 --> 38:16.026
Good night, Dan.

39:20.158 --> 39:23.556
There we go, princess.

40:24.079 --> 40:27.079
I thought it might be whisky, but
it doesn't smell like whisky to me.

40:31.676 --> 40:33.150
Know what it is?

40:34.730 --> 40:36.610
Smells like reindeer juice.

40:54.121 --> 40:56.284
I appreciate this, Captain Tannar.

40:56.810 --> 40:58.117
What the hell's going on?

41:01.833 --> 41:03.308
Ingrid. Fuck's sake.

41:10.080 --> 41:11.579
Get in the car, Rune.

41:41.479 --> 41:44.255
- Hello, Tavrani. Got a moment?
- Yeah.

41:50.410 --> 41:54.700
You remember once you got hold
of some, err, reindeer juice?

41:55.424 --> 42:00.113
- What?
- You know. Muscimol. We didn't dare take it, we were just kids.

42:02.591 --> 42:03.983
Ever try it since?

42:05.618 --> 42:07.695
It's not like a bit of weed, Eric.

42:08.233 --> 42:10.268
You don't mess with that stuff.

42:10.303 --> 42:11.928
We used to mess with everything else.

42:11.998 --> 42:15.757
This is a very serious
trip. It can go very wrong.

42:15.815 --> 42:16.798
And then?

42:16.990 --> 42:24.066
Horrors. Nightmares. Unnameable
dread. It can last for days.

42:25.078 --> 42:27.109
Some people don't ever come back.

42:27.534 --> 42:31.635
They say it lets your
soul join the spirit world.

42:32.264 --> 42:35.442
Battle demons so you can heal your tribe.

42:37.830 --> 42:40.135
Sounds like just your kind of stuff.

42:40.958 --> 42:42.438
Why are you here, Eric?

42:43.453 --> 42:45.953
Ever heard of a Laszlo Hindemith?

42:45.988 --> 42:47.370
Nope.

42:47.370 --> 42:49.890
Just started at the Research Centre.

42:50.081 --> 42:54.793
About two weeks ago, he dropped
out. Started doing weird stuff.

42:54.828 --> 42:56.970
Pills. Animal sedatives.

42:57.046 --> 42:58.243
No shit.

43:01.050 --> 43:03.970
Seems he was hiding some
serious mental health issues.

43:04.005 --> 43:07.005
In fact, I'd say he was falling apart.

43:08.073 --> 43:09.637
Why are you telling me this?

43:10.172 --> 43:12.872
He was drinking reindeer juice, Tavrani.

43:14.130 --> 43:16.024
I told you. I don't do it.

43:16.516 --> 43:17.937
Let alone give it out.

43:21.610 --> 43:28.299
So if I open this and find
a fresh batch, you'll have an

43:28.334 --> 43:29.992
explanation for that?

43:37.207 --> 43:40.407
I bet you've got half a
litre chilled down in here.

43:48.318 --> 43:49.631
_

43:51.196 --> 43:53.370
The demon is among us.

43:58.190 --> 43:59.571
Ingrid!
