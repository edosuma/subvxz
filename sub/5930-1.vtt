01:02.271 --> 01:04.272
[shotgun blast]
Shit!

01:21.415 --> 01:22.792
[gunshot]

01:43.979 --> 01:45.981
[gunshot]

01:54.406 --> 01:55.999
[brakes screeching]

01:56.575 --> 01:58.498
Crazy-drivin' motherfucker.

01:59.286 --> 02:00.913
- Shit.
- Come on.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.172
Hey! Hey, Marvin,
what are you doin'?

02:06.376 --> 02:08.628
- He's mine, Jack. Get lost.
- Fuck you he's yours, he's mine.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.589
Eddie assigned this guy to me.
What the hell are you doing'?

02:10.797 --> 02:11.844
Well then go
straighten it out with Eddie.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.054
I'll collect the money.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.135
I almost got killed
tryin' to get this guy.

02:15.344 --> 02:17.142
- He shot at me--
- Back off, goddamn it!

02:17.346 --> 02:18.848
I said I'm takin' him, all right?

02:19.056 --> 02:20.933
- All right, Marvin.
- This guy's worth $1,200!

02:21.141 --> 02:21.892
Okay, okay Marvin.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.818
What the hell are we fightin' for?
We're friends- -

02:24.019 --> 02:26.442
Nothin' personal, Jack,
but fuck off, all right?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.866
Take it easy. Jesus!

02:29.441 --> 02:30.863
Marvin, watch out!

02:32.069 --> 02:34.413
What the fuck's goin' on?
You guys ain't cops.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.498
No, we're ballet dancers.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.660
Didn't your mother ever teach you
how to react to strangers?

02:39.868 --> 02:41.495
Not shoot at them? Huh?

02:56.134 --> 02:58.762
Hey, Marvin, thanks for the car.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.141
You sleep,
and I'll bring it back a little later.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.943
[engine starts]

03:24.371 --> 03:26.339
Got a delivery for you, Gooch.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.467
Jack. The soda machine's been out
for a week and a half.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.305
Check that for me, would ya?

03:33.797 --> 03:35.424
What do we got here?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.017
Alright.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.729
- Give you any trouble?
- Did you give me any trouble?

03:41.972 --> 03:44.020
- Fuck you, man!
- He didn't give me any trouble.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.646
Fuck you, too, man!

03:45.851 --> 03:48.104
- Move!
- I know my motherfuckin' rights!

03:52.232 --> 03:53.484
Slap it.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.659
Moscone's Bail Bonds.

04:46.036 --> 04:49.631
No, it's cash only.
No checks, no cards.

04:50.165 --> 04:54.762
I'm sorry, ma'am. That's the policy.
I wish I could help you out. Sorry.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.058
Just dropped off Bouchet. Is Eddie in?

05:00.258 --> 05:02.477
So you finally caught someone, Jack.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.437
Jerry, is he in?

05:05.013 --> 05:06.640
I think that's terrific.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.317
Jack, I been tryin' to reach
you since last night.

05:09.518 --> 05:10.519
What do you got for me?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.479
Been tryin' to reach me? It's Bouchet.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.606
Ooh, Bouchet. Good score, Jack.
$900, right?

05:14.815 --> 05:15.987
No, it's $1,200.

05:16.274 --> 05:19.244
- No, $900.
- That's, that's $1,200. Come on.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.242
No. Yeah, you're right.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.536
My stomach's killin' me.

05:24.741 --> 05:25.913
<i>I'm gain' over
to Chin Leo's for breakfast.</i>

05:26.117 --> 05:28.870
- I want to talk to you.
- About what?

05:29.746 --> 05:32.499
- I'll talk to you over there.
- Could I have my money first?

05:33.500 --> 05:34.717
Of course.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.636
What, do you think
I'm gonna try and stiff you?

05:36.837 --> 05:38.931
You? Never!
He would never try and stiff me.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.552
Do I detect some kind of sarcasm here?

05:40.757 --> 05:41.679
Never.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.851
Where have
I inherited this reputation?

05:44.052 --> 05:45.850
I have never done business
with anybody,

05:46.054 --> 05:47.271
and Jerry is my witness...

05:47.472 --> 05:49.395
...that I have ever, ever, ever...

05:49.599 --> 05:50.441
Has that phone ever rang...

05:50.642 --> 05:53.236
Has that phone ever rang
with a complaint about me?

05:53.770 --> 05:56.068
Never, never. So let's go.
I'll buy you some breakfast.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.115
I don't eat breakfast.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.901
Well then, have an early lunch.
Let's go.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.781
You ever hear of a guy
named Jonathan Mardukas?

06:04.990 --> 06:07.243
- The Duke. Yeah, I know who he is.
- What do you know?

06:07.450 --> 06:09.327
He's that accountant that
embezzled a couple of million

06:09.536 --> 06:11.379
from some Vegas wise guy
and he gave it to charity.

06:11.580 --> 06:12.422
That's very good.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.876
Only thing is, that it wasn't a couple
of million. It was $15 million.

06:16.042 --> 06:19.012
It wasn't some Vegas wise guy.
It was Jimmy Serrano.

06:20.171 --> 06:22.265
I know, I know.
I can read the papers.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.219
Look, I don't want to
bring up the past, but...

06:26.052 --> 06:27.520
...isn't Serrano the guy
that ran you

06:27.721 --> 06:29.894
out of Chicago when he
was runnin' things back there?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.065
He didn't run me out.

06:31.266 --> 06:34.019
Yeah, right right right. You gave
up bein' a cop to do this shit?

06:35.478 --> 06:37.856
- Alright, what's the point?
- The point, Jack:

06:38.231 --> 06:41.485
I bailed out the accountant.
I didn't know who he was at the time.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.572
I mean, had I known there was
no way I would've put up the bond.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.122
I mean it's only a matter of time

06:46.323 --> 06:48.576
before Serrano vanishes
this guy from the planet

06:48.742 --> 06:50.540
and I'm out $450,000.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.792
You're out $450,000 on this guy?

06:53.038 --> 06:54.130
- No.
- No.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.425
No, because I got you,
and you're the best,

06:56.625 --> 06:58.798
and you're gonna find him
and bring him back.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.299
Yeah, right.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.426
How do you even know
this guy is still alive?

07:02.631 --> 07:06.636
Because this guy is crazy.
He sends postcards to Serrano.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.437
He's tellin' him what a great time
he's havin' with his money.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.890
How much time you got left?

07:12.057 --> 07:14.435
Friday, midnight, I default.
I eat the $450,000.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.645
This Friday? That's five days.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.026
Forget it. You go find him,
give me my money.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.322
Jack, alright, look.
Listen to me.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.117
I'll give you $40...
I'll give you $50,000.

07:23.318 --> 07:26.117
$50,000? I gotta chase you down
for $1,200. Forget about it.

07:26.321 --> 07:29.200
- No, no, no, no, Jack, please.
- Jack, nothing, forget about it. What else you got?

07:29.407 --> 07:30.784
I ain't got nothin', this is it.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.245
If you don't find this guy,
I'm out of business.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.501
Eddie...

07:36.539 --> 07:38.212
I'll do it for $100,000.

07:38.416 --> 07:40.760
$100,000? Are you out of your mind?
This is an easy gig.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.554
It's a midnight run for Chrissakes.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.223
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm tired of gettin' shot at.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.425
I'm tired of this
miserable fuckin' business,

07:47.634 --> 07:48.977
every lowlife that I run into.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.225
If you're gonna pay me,
you gotta pay me what's right.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.852
You want me for this job,
give me what's right.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.980
First of all,
the guy is an accountant.

07:56.184 --> 07:57.401
He's not gonna shoot you.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.321
All you have to do is find him.
You put him in a bag,

08:00.522 --> 08:02.024
hit him with a rubber hose,
bring him home.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.779
That's easy for you to say,
listen to me,

08:03.984 --> 08:07.033
it's $100,000, no more, no less,
and I want a contract.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.831
- Contract?
- That's right, I want it in writing.

08:10.031 --> 08:12.625
$100,000, and I'll have the Duke
here for you by Friday night.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.874
Now, can I have my $1,200, please?

08:18.623 --> 08:21.923
Man, you do worse than any crook
I ever put a bond up for.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.470
Stanley?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.438
Stan.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.191
Hey, Big Dog. How are you?

08:40.937 --> 08:42.405
What are you doin' here?

08:42.605 --> 08:44.107
Listen, I need a favor.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.068
I need to see the booking slip
of a Jonathan Mardukas.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.075
M-A-R-D-U-K-A-S.

08:49.279 --> 08:51.077
There you go.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.923
- Yes, sir.
- What's that?

09:01.750 --> 09:03.969
The number he called
right after he was arrested.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.930
212 area code.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.467
Looks like I'm goin' to New York.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.268
Are you Jack Walsh?

09:21.227 --> 09:22.649
- Excuse me.
- Are you Jack Walsh?

09:22.854 --> 09:25.858
- I'm sorry, do I know you?
- Alonzo Mosely, FBI.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.069
That's a nice badge.
How can I get one of those?

09:29.277 --> 09:30.494
I want to talk to you, Jack.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.413
Yeah? Why don't you
call my social secretary?

09:32.614 --> 09:35.037
Yeah, very funny.
I want to talk to you.

09:35.450 --> 09:37.452
Take your hands off me!

09:40.121 --> 09:41.247
Jeez.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.916
Take it easy!

09:45.960 --> 09:47.587
You know it's a $10 fine
for jaywalking in Los Angeles?

09:47.796 --> 09:48.922
Shut up.

09:49.172 --> 09:50.298
What I want to know is

09:50.507 --> 09:53.761
are you working on anything
having to do with Jonathan Mardukas?

09:54.677 --> 09:56.350
Never heard of him.

09:56.554 --> 09:58.477
Well, I believe you have heard of him.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.438
Let me tell you something, asshole.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.395
We've been working on
this Jimmy Serrano thing

10:03.603 --> 10:05.321
for about six years.

10:05.563 --> 10:07.531
Mardukas is my shot.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.947
I'm gonna bring him into federal court

10:10.151 --> 10:12.028
and I don't want any
third rate rent-a-thug

10:12.237 --> 10:13.955
who couldn't cut it
as a cop in Chicago

10:14.155 --> 10:17.079
bringing him to LA
on some bullshit local charge.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.969
Do I make myself understood?

10:28.503 --> 10:30.130
Can I ask you something?

10:31.256 --> 10:33.429
These sunglasses, they're really nice.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.885
Are they government issued

10:35.093 --> 10:37.767
or do all you guys go to, like,
the same store to get them?

10:41.766 --> 10:43.609
Do I make myself understood?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.437
Can't you take a joke?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.402
Get him out of here.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.234
No, let's talk some more.

10:51.442 --> 10:52.534
Get the fuck out of here.

10:52.735 --> 10:54.408
If I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.330
Good-bye. Have a nice day.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.124
Think I could have my sunglasses back?

11:02.328 --> 11:03.295
Here's your sunglasses.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.248
[engine revs]

11:07.959 --> 11:11.179
Thanks. Thanks for this, too.

11:15.133 --> 11:16.976
"Alonzo Mosely."

11:17.969 --> 11:19.346
Alonzo.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.019
How's that?

12:08.269 --> 12:10.738
Looks fine to me.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.692
Harold Longman, please.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.451
Harry? Jack Walsh.
How're you doin'?

12:18.655 --> 12:21.750
You got that address check
on that phone number for me?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.416
Uh-huh.

12:25.411 --> 12:29.541
Okay, thanks a lot, Harry.
Say hello to Julie for me. Okay, bye.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.961
Thank you.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.674
You Jack Walsh?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.845
- Who wants to know?
- That's a "Yes."

12:42.262 --> 12:44.014
We'd really like to have
a word with you.

12:44.222 --> 12:47.442
- Yeah? What about?
- It involves big cash, lot of prizes.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.318
I'll make it short and sweet.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.113
The people I work for are really
interested in your visit here.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.781
Oh yeah? Who are the
people you work for?

12:53.982 --> 12:56.360
An old friend of yours
from the Chicago days.

12:57.777 --> 12:58.949
You're here for the Duke.

12:59.153 --> 13:01.201
You think he's in New York,
and we think you're right.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.784
That's a nice jacket.
What is it, goatskin?

13:03.992 --> 13:06.791
Come on, Joey, please. Will you?
Never mind him.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.917
The way I hear it,

13:09.163 --> 13:11.791
you didn't cooperate
with my boss a few years back.

13:11.958 --> 13:13.210
Is that the way you heard it?

13:13.418 --> 13:15.420
Yeah, but I got a
news flash for you, Jack.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.971
He'd pay a hell of a lot more
for the Duke

13:17.130 --> 13:18.473
than that putz bail bondsman
back in LA.

13:18.673 --> 13:21.472
- Oh yeah? How much more?
- How about a one with six zeros?

13:24.345 --> 13:25.813
Are you gonna propose?

13:26.180 --> 13:27.147
- Propose?
- Propose.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.725
'Cause if you're not,
quit starin' at me.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.105
- Okay?
- Starin' at you?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.483
- You're staring at me.
- Joey, back off, will you please? C'mon.

13:32.687 --> 13:36.783
Mr. Walsh, your car's located
in space number 206.

13:36.983 --> 13:39.532
You can catch our shuttle bus
just through these doors.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.198
Thank you.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.913
Here's my number, Jack.
Ask for Tony Darvo. That's me.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.957
They'll put you through
to wherever I am.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.665
And be good to
yourself this time. Okay?

13:51.331 --> 13:53.129
Tell Jimmy I said hello.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.537
[phone ringing]

14:28.868 --> 14:30.996
- [Woman]: Hello?
- Hello? Mrs. Nelson?

14:32.372 --> 14:33.965
Alonzo Mosely,
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

14:34.207 --> 14:36.881
- How are you this afternoon?
- I'm fine.

14:37.085 --> 14:39.588
Let me get right to the
point if I may, Mrs. Nelson.

14:39.796 --> 14:42.265
An agent in our Los Angeles office
discovered a detail

14:42.465 --> 14:44.217
that was somehow overlooked until now.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.473
It seems that when a
Jonathan Mardukas was arrested

14:46.677 --> 14:50.102
you were the first person he called.
Is that correct, Mrs. Nelson?

14:51.599 --> 14:53.852
- <i>Are you there, Mrs. Nelson?
- Yes.</i>

14:54.060 --> 14:56.438
Needless to say, this is a
matter of great concern to us,

14:56.646 --> 14:57.989
and if it would not
be too much trouble,

14:58.189 --> 14:59.190
we would like you to come down

14:59.399 --> 15:03.029
tomorrow morning to 26 Federal Plaza.
Do you think you could do that?

15:03.277 --> 15:05.325
- I suppose so.
- About 9:00 a.m.?

15:06.614 --> 15:09.493
- Yes.
- Just ask for Agent Alonzo Mosely.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.370
Thanks for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.

- Dana? it's Helen.</i>

15:36.978 --> 15:38.025
<i>The FBI just called.</i>

15:38.229 --> 15:39.572
<i>They want to speak to me
about Jonathan.</i>

15:39.772 --> 15:43.322
<i>- Oh, my God! Helen.
- [Jonathan]: Helen, what's going on?</i>

15:43.526 --> 15:44.823
<i>[Helen]: Jonathan,
the FBI just called.</i>

15:45.027 --> 15:46.995
<i>They know we spoke the night
you were arrested.</i>

15:47.196 --> 15:49.449
<i>[Jonathan]: Hang up the phone, Helen.
Right now.</i>

- I don't know.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.017
Okay. Okay, Heidi. Okay.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.262
Alonzo Mosely, FBI!
You're under arrest!

18:16.470 --> 18:18.143
Get this fucking dog out of here!

18:18.347 --> 18:19.849
Get the dog out of here, ma'am!

18:20.057 --> 18:22.151
Not you. You stay there.
Get the dog, ma'am.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.603
- Do it, do it.
- Get the dog!

18:23.811 --> 18:25.563
Heidi. Come on, girl.
Come on, now.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.068
Good girl.
Come on, come on.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.742
Don't move or I'll shoot you
right through the glass.

18:35.865 --> 18:37.833
Get over here.
Put your hands up against the wall.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.836
Your hands up against the wall.
Spread your feet.

18:45.082 --> 18:47.176
Relax. There won't be a problem.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.717
Put your left hand behind your head.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.007
Put your left... That's it.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.778
You're taking me to the airport,
aren't you?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.781
You don't look
like an FBI agent to me.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.204
Yeah?
Well you don't look like a Duke to me.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.123
If you're an FBI agent,

19:18.324 --> 19:19.371
why don't you just take me
to the FBI office?

19:19.575 --> 19:23.546
If you don't be quiet, this is going
to be the worst trip of your life.

19:24.622 --> 19:26.420
You work for Jimmy Serrano,
don't you?

19:26.624 --> 19:28.126
I don't work for that
piece of shit.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.507
Your bail bondsman hired me
to bring you back to LA,

19:30.711 --> 19:31.712
and that's what I'm doing.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.839
- I got money, you know.
- I'm sure you do.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.676
- I'll give you whatever you want.
- Start by shutting up.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.728
I've known you all of two minutes,
and already I don't like you.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.432
Gee, that's too bad.
I really like you.

19:46.060 --> 19:48.233
I can't keep you cuffed
on a commercial flight.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.064
I gotta check my gun with my luggage,

19:50.272 --> 19:52.900
but you fuck with me once
and I'm gonna break your neck.

19:53.109 --> 19:54.452
- I can't fly.
- What?

19:54.652 --> 19:57.656
- You heard me. I can't fly.
- No, no. You're gonna have to do better than that, pal.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.787
No, I don't have to do better than that,
because it's the truth. I can't fly.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.789
- I suffer from aviophobia.
- What does that mean?

20:02.993 --> 20:06.463
It means I can't fly. I also suffer
from acrophobia and claustrophobia.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.507
Well, I'll tell you what.
If you don't cooperate,

20:08.708 --> 20:10.460
you're gonna suffer
from "fistophobia."

Jerry, put Eddie on the phone.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.478
Jack, what's the progress?

20:21.679 --> 20:22.805
- I got him.
- You got who?

20:23.013 --> 20:24.310
The Duke. He's standing right here.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.434
You got him? Already?

20:26.684 --> 20:28.277
<i>Sure do. Want to say hello?</i>

20:28.477 --> 20:30.730
Say hello to your bail bondsman,
Eddie Moscone.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.064
Hello.

20:32.314 --> 20:34.442
There you go.
Jonathan Mardukas in the flesh.

20:34.650 --> 20:35.822
Jack, I love you!

20:36.026 --> 20:38.324
<i>What happened? How did this happen?
Where'd you find him?</i>

20:38.571 --> 20:40.869
<i>[Jack]: I found him in New York.
We're at the airport.</i>

20:41.073 --> 20:42.996
<i>[Eddie]: Holy Christ,
this is wonderful!</i>

20:43.159 --> 20:44.285
<i>This is wonderful news!</i>

20:44.452 --> 20:46.079
<i>[Jack]: I'll be in your office
by midnight tonight</i>

20:46.287 --> 20:47.459
<i>and I'm tellin' you right now, Eddie,</i>

20:47.663 --> 20:49.961
<i>I don't want to hear any bullshit.
I want the money tonight.</i>

20:50.166 --> 20:51.793
So go empty out
one of your Swiss bank accounts.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.881
No, Jack, you don't have
to worry about nothin'.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.338
This is the best money
I've ever spent.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.181
<i>Okay. See you in a few hours.</i>

20:57.381 --> 20:59.554
All right. I'll see you later.
'Night.

21:01.469 --> 21:05.064
- So what's that all about?
- Jerry Walsh got the Duke!

21:05.890 --> 21:08.985
- Walsh got the Duke?
- He got him! He got the Duke!

21:09.185 --> 21:11.483
No kiddin'?
This calls for a celebration.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.277
I'll get some donuts.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.574
How do you think Walsh
found him so fast?

21:32.833 --> 21:33.925
Yeah, hello.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.840
Tony, this is Jerry.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.222
- Jerry who?
- Jerry Geisler.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.891
- What are you doing?
- Eating dinner. What do you want?

21:41.091 --> 21:44.391
Look, I hate to bother you
but I thought you'd like to know

21:44.637 --> 21:47.436
that Walsh found the Duke in New York.

21:48.224 --> 21:51.603
<i>They're flyin' in tonight.
They should arrive around midnight.</i>

21:51.977 --> 21:54.821
- Don't forget me, babe.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, kid, yeah.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.778
Thanks. Good night.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.880
Looks like your old friend
found the accountant.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.713
They'll be flying into LA
around midnight.

22:21.090 --> 22:22.842
Have them met at the airport.

22:23.259 --> 22:25.307
- You understand?
- Done.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.687
- Can I take your coat?
- That's fine. Thanks.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.609
- May I take your coat?
- No.

22:34.061 --> 22:37.531
First class is nice.
I could make a habit out of this.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.909
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening to you.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.487
Would either of you like a drink
before we take off?

22:42.695 --> 22:44.868
Yes, we would like
one of your finest champagnes.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.373
Certainly.

22:47.825 --> 22:50.419
Let's see. Look at this.

22:50.870 --> 22:54.090
Only in America. What a country. Huh?

22:55.833 --> 22:57.335
Unbelievable.

22:57.668 --> 23:00.421
I think I'm gonna have the steak.
How about you?

23:01.255 --> 23:02.507
I'm not hungry.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.391
Well why don't you
then get the lobster,

23:04.550 --> 23:07.019
because then I can get a little
surf and turf action going.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.393
I got a problem.
I can't fly.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.020
I don't think
you're takin' me seriously.

23:12.266 --> 23:15.315
- I'm takin' you very seriously.
- I can't be on this plane.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.396
You think I haven't
heard your story before?

23:17.605 --> 23:19.949
Who do you think you're
traveling with, a fucking novice?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.242
Know what I'm talkin' about?

23:22.484 --> 23:24.157
That's it. Settle in.

23:24.361 --> 23:26.204
If you want to get up and talk
and be social and

23:26.405 --> 23:27.702
mingle with the rest
of the passengers,

23:27.907 --> 23:29.955
be my guest.
You ain't goin' nowhere.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.498
There's a couple
of nice-lookin' people here.

23:32.703 --> 23:34.330
Better class of people.

23:34.872 --> 23:38.046
Your class.
Probably all embezzlers, too.

23:40.753 --> 23:45.224

Come fly with me, come fly away...

23:51.639 --> 23:54.893
[engine starting]

23:55.225 --> 23:57.273
Why don't you just try and relax?

24:03.359 --> 24:04.702
Look, I...

24:05.027 --> 24:08.201
Just calm down.
Just relax and calm down.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.454
What are you
gettin' so excited about?

24:11.659 --> 24:13.286
It's not--

24:14.411 --> 24:17.085
No! I can't! I can't.

24:17.331 --> 24:20.631
No, no, no!
I can't! I can't.

24:20.876 --> 24:22.799
Just relax! What did I tell you?

24:23.003 --> 24:27.008
- Now, don't pull that shit on me--
- No no no. I'm tellin' you, I can't do it.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.388
No, I can't!

24:28.592 --> 24:30.469
- These things go down!
- All right.

24:30.678 --> 24:34.774
These things go down! It's too big!
It's too big! It can't go up!

24:34.974 --> 24:37.147
[engines winding down]

24:38.811 --> 24:41.064
All right, everyone. Just calm down.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.949
- Alright, what's the problem?
- It's nothing, sir. It's okay.

24:44.149 --> 24:46.197
Alonzo Mosely, FBI.
This man is in my custody.

24:46.402 --> 24:47.278
I'm taking him
back to Los Angeles.

24:47.486 --> 24:48.829
There won't be any more problems.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.747
I don't want to fly.
I can't fly, really.

24:50.948 --> 24:52.996
You can't take a prisoner aboard
an airplane if he doesn't want to fly.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.543
You should know that.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.747
I do. I'm sorry. I thought he was
bluffing. I thought he was bluffing.

24:57.913 --> 25:00.917
I suggest you find some other mode
of transportation.

25:09.049 --> 25:12.178
- What the fuck are you smilin' about?
- I love to travel by train.

25:12.386 --> 25:15.060
Oh yeah? What do you think
this is, a class trip?

25:15.514 --> 25:17.357
Are you always this angry?

25:17.599 --> 25:19.476
Hey, look, right now
I'm in a great fucking mood.

25:19.685 --> 25:21.437
You wait'll I'm cooped up
on that thing for a while

25:21.645 --> 25:22.737
and you're not gonna be smilin'.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.316
You're gonna be runnin'
for that fucking jail cell.

25:25.941 --> 25:27.943
Still gonna make your schedule?

25:28.193 --> 25:30.287
I'll make it, 14 hours to spare.

25:32.990 --> 25:36.210
Oh, nice, nice. It's a double.
It's a double.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.629
- There'll be a lot of room.
- Glad you like it.

25:40.956 --> 25:44.506
Thanks, 'cause they're starting
to cut into my wrists. Thank you.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.804
It just gets the skin after a while.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.632
- Get in there.
- What do you want? What?

25:50.674 --> 25:52.972
Oh, come on. Come on.

25:53.469 --> 25:55.813
- Why would you do that?
- You enjoy yourself.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.311
This is my room, and that's your room.
Good night.

26:14.406 --> 26:18.206
- Hey, can I help you guys?
- Special Agent Mosely, FBI.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.371
Mosely? Are all you guys named Mosely?

26:20.579 --> 26:22.252
What the hell are you talking about?

26:22.456 --> 26:24.504
You're here to pick up a prisoner,
right?

26:24.708 --> 26:25.834
How did you know that?

26:26.043 --> 26:28.592
He was afraid to fly,
so he got off the plane.

26:28.796 --> 26:31.265
He left with an Agent Mosely.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.889
Sir, that must mean that Walsh
has your identification.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.271
[phone ringing]

26:41.475 --> 26:42.192
Yeah?

26:42.392 --> 26:46.147
Is this Moron Number 1?
Put Moron Number 2 on the phone.

26:46.396 --> 26:48.615
Yeah, Jimmy.
He's, uh, right here. Hold on.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.113
He's pissed.

26:52.736 --> 26:53.487
Yeah?

26:53.487 --> 26:55.455
I thought you told me this guy
was gonna be on the plane.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.124
That's the information we got, Jimmy.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.747
"That's the information we got."
I'm gonna tell you something,

26:59.952 --> 27:02.171
I want this guy taken out,
and I want him taken out fast.

27:02.329 --> 27:03.672
<i>You and that other dummy better start</i>

27:03.872 --> 27:06.000
<i>getting more personally
involved in your work</i>

27:05.999 --> 27:08.593
or I'm gonna stab you through the heart
with a fucking pencil, do you understand me?

27:08.961 --> 27:10.338
You got it, Jimmy.

27:16.093 --> 27:19.188
Tony.
He ain't mad at me, is he?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.440
<i>[JOB]: Jack?</i>

27:26.395 --> 27:28.989
<i>Jack, I think this is illegal.</i>

27:30.274 --> 27:33.995
<i>Jack, I don't think you can
keep a person in a bathroom like this.</i>

27:35.195 --> 27:38.415
- It's very claustrophobic in here--
- Yeah, it is?

27:38.615 --> 27:42.540
Well, I'll tell you what. When we get to LA, you
can tell the prison psychiatrist all about it.

27:42.744 --> 27:45.668
<i>There's no air.
There's no ventilation in here.</i>

27:45.831 --> 27:48.175
<i>I told you I was claustrophobic.
Come on.</i>

<i>Jack?</i>

27:58.969 --> 28:00.812
<i>Jack?</i>

28:03.765 --> 28:06.109
Good. Thanks. Thanks.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.237
Thanks a lot.

28:13.317 --> 28:15.069
- Good.
- Sit down.

28:15.402 --> 28:18.747
Yeah, that's great. Very kind of you.

28:23.577 --> 28:26.421
Nice, much better. Thank you. Good.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.513
What are you doing?

28:35.005 --> 28:36.382
What am I doin'?

28:37.424 --> 28:39.347
- Arithmetic.
- Arithmetic?

28:39.551 --> 28:42.100
Maybe I can help you.
I am an accountant.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.809
Well, you know what?

28:43.972 --> 28:46.270
I was thinkin', after I turn your
ass in and collect my money,

28:46.516 --> 28:48.518
I'm gonna open up
a nice little coffee shop.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.321
How much exactly are you getting
for me, may I ask?

28:51.521 --> 28:53.615
I don't think that's any
of your concern,

28:53.815 --> 28:55.658
but I'll tell you just to tell you.

28:56.818 --> 28:59.196
- $100,000.
- $100,000?

28:59.529 --> 29:02.078
Does that mean you'd take $100,000
to let me go?

29:02.282 --> 29:03.784
Not by a long shot.

29:04.785 --> 29:05.832
$200,000?

29:06.036 --> 29:07.538
I never took a payoff in my life,

29:07.746 --> 29:09.589
and I'm not gonna start
with someone like you.

29:09.790 --> 29:12.714
- Why not?
- Because you're a fucking criminal,

29:12.918 --> 29:15.171
and you deserve to go where you're goin',
and I'm gonna take you there.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.888
If I hear any more shit out of you

29:17.089 --> 29:18.386
I'm gonna fucking
bust your head and

29:18.590 --> 29:20.308
I'm gonna put you back
in that fucking hole

29:20.509 --> 29:22.682
and I'm gonna stick your head
in the fucking toilet bowl

29:22.886 --> 29:25.230
and I'm gonna make it stay there.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.566
I have to tell you,

29:31.770 --> 29:33.568
a restaurant is a very
tricky investment.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.525
More than half of them go under
within the first six months.

29:36.733 --> 29:37.700
If I were your accountant,

29:37.901 --> 29:39.619
I'd have to
strongly advise you against it.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.447
You would, huh? Well,
you're not my accountant.

29:41.655 --> 29:43.202
If I were your accountant--

29:43.407 --> 29:44.954
I told you, I took you out here--

29:45.117 --> 29:48.041
No, I'm just saying that
it's a very, very tricky business and

29:48.245 --> 29:49.667
if I were your accountant,

29:49.871 --> 29:52.670
I would really strongly have
to advise you against it,

29:52.874 --> 29:53.966
as an accountant.

29:54.167 --> 29:57.341
- You're not my accountant.
- I realize I'm not your accountant.

29:59.840 --> 30:01.717
I'm just saying
if I were your accountant...

30:06.471 --> 30:07.097
Jerry...

30:07.347 --> 30:09.600
How the hell could he
miss the goddamn plane?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.651
He called from the airport!

30:12.102 --> 30:16.573
Alright, alright. It's time to bring in
Marvin, alright? Call him up. He's in Pittsburgh.

30:16.773 --> 30:18.491
- Marvin Dorfler?
- Yeah, Dorfler.

30:18.692 --> 30:21.241
Under "D" in the Rolodex
for "jerk," Jerry.

30:23.447 --> 30:25.370
Can I at least have some french fries?

30:25.574 --> 30:28.373
I said no, pecker breath. Now shut up.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.373
[phone rings]

30:36.418 --> 30:37.294
Yeah, Dorfler.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.346
Marvin?
Sweetheart, am I glad I got you!

30:40.714 --> 30:43.263
- Boy, do I have a job for you!
- Yeah? I'm listening.

30:43.467 --> 30:46.141
First of all I gotta apologize,
because we were trying to find you

30:46.345 --> 30:48.848
and it's a very important job,
but I couldn't find you.

30:49.056 --> 30:51.730
So I had to give it to Walsh,
but now he's fucking it up...

30:51.933 --> 30:53.651
I don't know why you
keep hiring that fucking guy.

30:53.852 --> 30:58.028
<i>I know. I apologize. You are the best
at what you do. You know that? Now listen.</i>

30:58.231 --> 30:59.699
Do you know who
Jonathan Mardukas is?

30:59.900 --> 31:02.323
- No.
- Jonathan Mardukas, the Duke?

31:02.527 --> 31:05.076
- Eddie, I never heard of him.
- Alright, listen. That's not important.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.284
What's important is that you find him
and you bring him back. Okay?

31:08.492 --> 31:10.540
Now, last I heard,
he had him in New York,

31:10.744 --> 31:12.496
and now I don't know
where the hell they are.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.082
<i>But if you find him,
I'll give you what I'm givin' Walsh.</i>

31:15.290 --> 31:16.917
Yeah, what's that?

31:17.834 --> 31:19.211
$25,000.

31:19.586 --> 31:21.338
<i>But you gotta have him
back by Friday, midnight.</i>

31:21.546 --> 31:22.513
<i>Otherwise the deal is off.</i>

31:22.714 --> 31:26.184
Yeah, well, don't worry, Eddie. For $25,000,
I'll bring him in on a silver platter.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.934
Bring him any way you want,
but bring him, okay?

31:29.137 --> 31:30.013
Bye.

31:33.475 --> 31:34.601
Hey, scumbag.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.437
My name's Carmine, fucko.

31:36.645 --> 31:39.239
Yeah, well, Carmine,
today's your lucky day.

31:40.440 --> 31:43.114
- Why is today my “Icky da ,,
<i>'</i> Shut up! y'

31:43.318 --> 31:45.571
Yeah, yeah, my name
is Jack Walsh.

31:45.779 --> 31:47.952
Excuse me. John Wesley Walsh.

31:48.156 --> 31:50.250
Yeah, I think I lost my credit card.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.919
Can you tell me
the last place I used it?

31:54.621 --> 31:59.593
Yeah, 731-483-9521-13.

32:00.669 --> 32:03.263
The Amtrak office,
Grand Central Station?

32:05.006 --> 32:07.054
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah. I
remember that now.

32:07.259 --> 32:08.977
Yeah, okay, yeah.
Thanks very much.

32:09.177 --> 32:10.895
Hey, uh...

32:11.096 --> 32:13.144
Maybe we ought to cancel that card, huh?

32:13.807 --> 32:15.184
Yeah. Thank you.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.502
Familiar with the word
"arteriosclerosis"?

32:36.705 --> 32:38.423
"Cholesterol"?

32:40.041 --> 32:42.840
If you want, I'll outline
a complete balanced diet for you.

32:43.044 --> 32:44.967
Mail it to me from C-Block.

32:47.382 --> 32:48.850
Why would you eat that?

32:49.050 --> 32:50.518
Why? 'Cause it tastes good.

32:50.719 --> 32:52.847
- But it's not good for you.
- I'm aware of that.

32:53.054 --> 32:55.853
Why would you do something,
if you know it's not good for you?

32:56.057 --> 32:57.434
Because I don't think about it.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.064
That's living in denial.

32:59.269 --> 33:00.987
- Living in denial?
- Yeah.

33:02.606 --> 33:03.858
I'm aware of that.

33:04.024 --> 33:06.493
So you're aware of all your behavior
yet you continue to do things

33:06.693 --> 33:07.910
that aren't good for you.

33:08.111 --> 33:10.205
That sounds sort of foolish.
Don't you think so, Jack?

33:10.405 --> 33:13.830
No. Stealing $15 million
from Jimmy Serrano sounds foolish.

33:16.703 --> 33:18.376
I didn't think I'd get caught.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.215
Now, that's livin' in denial.

33:20.457 --> 33:21.754
I'm aware of that.

33:21.958 --> 33:23.551
So you're aware of your behavior

33:23.752 --> 33:26.676
and yet you continue to do things
that aren't good for you.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.803
Sounds kind of foolish to me,
don't you think, Jon?

33:29.007 --> 33:29.929
It was foolish.

33:30.133 --> 33:33.182
But taking $15 million in mob money
and giving it to charity

33:33.386 --> 33:34.888
was good for a lot of people.

33:35.096 --> 33:36.439
So you pissed off a Mafioso killer

33:36.640 --> 33:38.688
just to be loved
by a bunch of fuckin' strangers.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.018
That makes a lot of sense.

33:40.227 --> 33:41.945
Don't you want to be loved?

33:44.397 --> 33:45.944
Lots of people love me.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.946
Really?

33:50.320 --> 33:51.822
Who?

33:52.447 --> 33:55.291
I got an ex-wife,
and I got a daughter in Chicago.

33:58.995 --> 34:01.464
How do they put up
with all your sarcasm?

34:01.748 --> 34:04.467
Beautifully. I haven't seen either
of them in nine years.

34:04.668 --> 34:06.420
Think maybe we should go see them?

34:06.628 --> 34:09.130
No, I don't think maybe
we should go see them.

34:09.339 --> 34:11.056
Thanks for the interest, though.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.304
The job must have been tough on them.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.512
- I didn't do this then.
- What did you do?

34:15.719 --> 34:18.518
- I was a cop.
- You were a cop in Chicago?

34:20.100 --> 34:22.569
Then you must know
all about Jimmy Serrano.

34:23.436 --> 34:25.530
Do you have the right
to ask these sort of questions?

34:25.730 --> 34:27.277
- Yeah, I think I do.
- No, you don't.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.734
- I think I do.
- No, you don't.

34:28.942 --> 34:29.943
Why not?

34:31.027 --> 34:32.654
Dinner's over. Let's go.

34:36.366 --> 34:38.744
I can see this is gonna
be some fuckin' trip.

34:38.952 --> 34:42.547
I wouldn't worry about it, Jack.
I'm not gonna be with you that much longer.

34:42.746 --> 34:43.918
What do you mean?

34:44.123 --> 34:45.295
With what I know about Serrano,

34:45.500 --> 34:47.252
if I go to jail I'll be dead
within 24 hours,

34:47.502 --> 34:50.597
so sooner or later,
I'm gonna have to give you the slip.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.639
[chuckles]

34:54.050 --> 34:55.927
Glad you find it humorous.

34:58.972 --> 35:01.145
- Let's go.
- $2? That's all you're gonna leave?

35:01.349 --> 35:03.067
- That's 15 percent.
- That's 13 percent.

35:03.268 --> 35:05.691
These people depend
on tips for a living.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.848
Can I help you, sir?

35:41.931 --> 35:44.684
Yeah, yeah, I'm lookin' for this
buddy of mine, Jack Walsh.

35:44.893 --> 35:47.146
He told me he'd meet me on this train.

35:47.520 --> 35:51.366
Yeah, Mr. Walsh.
He's in Bedroom D, next car.

35:52.192 --> 35:54.695
- That next car?
- Yes, sir. That way.

35:54.903 --> 35:57.702
- Thanks.
- Sure thing. Have a good night.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.870
One word and you're dead, asshole.

36:44.160 --> 36:45.662
Shit! Son of a--

36:45.870 --> 36:47.668
[grunts]

36:49.666 --> 36:52.795
- How the fuck did you find out where I am?
- I ain't tellin' you shit!

36:53.002 --> 36:55.130
Marvin, you'll force me to do something
I don't want to!

36:55.338 --> 36:57.215
- What's going on here?
- Everything's under control.

36:57.424 --> 37:00.268
Take it easy. Alonzo Mosely, FBI.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.811
Radio ahead.
I want the local police

37:02.011 --> 37:03.729
at the next stop to place
this man under arrest.

37:03.930 --> 37:06.274
- What the fuck are you talkin' about?
- That's enough out of you!

37:06.474 --> 37:08.101
Go ahead.
Get on the horn and call the cops.

37:19.487 --> 37:20.739
Is this good news or bad news?

37:20.947 --> 37:22.199
Apparently Mardukas and Walsh

37:22.407 --> 37:24.205
are on the Amtrak
headed to Los Angeles.

37:24.409 --> 37:28.414
Another bounty hunter was arrested
after he tried to take Mardukas away.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.631
I want the jet ready in 20 minutes.

37:59.611 --> 38:02.581
- Where's Jack Walsh?
- He got off with the other guy...

38:02.781 --> 38:04.499
...two or three stops ago.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.993
His real name's Mosely.

38:07.410 --> 38:08.957
I'm Mosely!

38:13.208 --> 38:16.803
I want to make a collect call
to Eddie Moscone from Jack Walsh.

38:19.756 --> 38:23.181
- Moscone's Bail Bonds.
- Jerry, it's Jack. Put Eddie on.

38:23.510 --> 38:26.764
- Jesus, Jack! Where the hell have you been?
- Jack, I want to talk to him.

38:26.971 --> 38:27.813
Jack, where are you?

38:28.014 --> 38:29.641
Where am I?
Eddie, I want to ask you something.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.271
How come Dorfler wound up on my ass?

38:31.476 --> 38:33.319
Did you put him on this,
you son of a bitch?

38:33.520 --> 38:36.069
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Dorfler?
How could I put Dorfler on you?

38:36.272 --> 38:38.821
- I don't even know where the fuck you are.
- You had nothin' to do with it?

38:39.025 --> 38:40.698
Where are you?
You got the Duke or what?

38:40.902 --> 38:43.451
- You're damn right I got him.
- Where are you?

38:43.655 --> 38:47.159
<i>Where am I? I'm somewhere
between... I don't know. Toledo and Cleveland.</i>

38:47.367 --> 38:49.040
- We're gettin' on a bus.
- Bingo.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.289
Bus? What're you gonna do... Jack, don't get on a...
What, are you out of your mind?

38:52.497 --> 38:54.841
Will you just shut up for a minute
and listen to me? We're gettin' on a bus.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.464
<i>I just wanted to let you know
we're on our way, okay?</i>

38:57.669 --> 38:59.387
Don't hang UP!

38:59.671 --> 39:02.675
Shit! What the hell is this guy doin'?

39:02.924 --> 39:04.096
I don't know.

39:06.427 --> 39:07.724
Listen...

39:07.929 --> 39:09.897
Maybe I ought to get some donuts
or something, huh?

39:25.029 --> 39:27.452
Two one-way tickets
to Los Angeles, please.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.043
Still gonna make our schedule?

39:30.243 --> 39:32.371
Don't worry.
I'll get you there on time.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.922
Don't have any illusions.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.587
- Illusions?
- Illusions.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.171
Illusions.

39:38.376 --> 39:41.129
I'm sorry, sir.
This card's been canceled.

39:41.129 --> 39:43.177
Huh?
Has it been canceled?

39:43.423 --> 39:45.425
I'm sorry, that's a mistake.
Would you please try it again?

39:45.633 --> 39:47.931
- I checked it twice, sir.
- Please try it again.

39:48.136 --> 39:49.638
Please try it again.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.564
- Did you pay the bill?
- Shut up.

39:51.764 --> 39:53.357
I'm sorry, sir. It's been canceled.

39:53.600 --> 39:57.104
Ma'am, that is impossible. I pay my bills.
There is no way that that could be canceled.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.155
- It's been canceled.
- Shut up!

39:59.355 --> 40:00.732
- Please.
- It's canceled, sir.

40:00.940 --> 40:03.910
- Would you like to try another credit card?
- I don't have any other credit cards.

40:04.110 --> 40:06.329
- Or cash.
- Please, would you just try that again?

40:06.529 --> 40:07.872
- No.
- All right.

40:09.449 --> 40:11.292
Alonzo... Jack Walsh.

40:11.659 --> 40:13.081
Federal Bureau of investigation.

40:13.286 --> 40:15.789
This is an official business.
I'm taking this man and he's in my custody.

40:15.997 --> 40:19.171
I'm taking him to Los Angeles, okay?
So please try this once more.

40:20.543 --> 40:23.171
Jack Walsh is not the name
on that badge, sir.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.180
Would you like me to call the FBI?

40:30.094 --> 40:31.937
Or would you like to pay cash?

40:34.349 --> 40:38.274
- How much is it?
- $264 for two tickets.

40:38.478 --> 40:39.900
$264.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.526
Here's $100.

40:47.195 --> 40:49.448
- Got any money on you?
- A lot.

40:56.579 --> 40:58.377
You call that a lot of money?

40:58.581 --> 41:00.675
It's enough to get you
where I'm gonna get you.

41:03.002 --> 41:07.052
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

41:07.256 --> 41:09.679
Got the whole fuckin' force after me, huh?

41:09.676 --> 41:10.723
[laughs]

41:26.901 --> 41:28.448
Who the fuck are you?

41:28.903 --> 41:30.826
Special Agent Mosely, FBI.

41:31.406 --> 41:33.249
Oh, goddamn it! I didn't do anything.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.869
Relax. Just want to ask you
a few questions, that's all.

41:36.077 --> 41:38.250
Yeah. Fucking A. Help yourself.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.519
So what do you know about Jack Walsh?

41:57.724 --> 42:00.728
Oh, no, no. Come on, come on.
Cigarettes are killers.

42:01.644 --> 42:02.566
So are women.

42:02.770 --> 42:06.024
Not the right woman. My wife
and I have a wonderful relationship.

42:06.232 --> 42:07.324
She's stuck it out with me
through all of this.

42:07.483 --> 42:10.453
Stuck it out with you and
all your millions, what a trooper.

42:10.653 --> 42:13.827
I don't have millions, Jack.
I gave it all to charity, remember?

42:14.032 --> 42:16.330
You didn't keep
just a little for yourself, Jon?

42:16.325 --> 42:18.373
I kept enough to get away
and stay hidden.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.291
Yeah, right.

42:20.538 --> 42:23.212
You know, when we change buses in Chicago
you're gonna have a couple hours.

42:23.458 --> 42:24.675
I think you'd be a better man

42:24.876 --> 42:26.799
if you used that time to
look up your ex-wife and daughter.

42:27.003 --> 42:28.505
It's a perfect opportunity.

42:28.713 --> 42:30.886
Why don't you mind your own business?

42:35.428 --> 42:38.056
Let me ask you this: Why is it you
haven't seen them in nine years?

42:38.264 --> 42:39.516
- Why?
- Yeah.

42:39.724 --> 42:41.351
Just to get you off my back
I'll tell you why.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.106
She married a police lieutenant

42:43.311 --> 42:45.313
and I'm not very popular
with the Chicago Police Department.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.282
- Why aren't you popular with them?
- That's a whole other...

42:48.483 --> 42:50.281
Do we know each other?

42:50.943 --> 42:52.320
- Why?
- Why?

42:53.154 --> 42:54.451
What did you do?

42:55.239 --> 42:57.287
Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police?

42:57.492 --> 42:59.745
That's something that
really doesn't concern you.

42:59.952 --> 43:02.455
- Did she hurt you, Jack?
- Yeah.

43:03.664 --> 43:06.087
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry about?

43:06.292 --> 43:08.545
- I'm sorry you're hurt.
- I'm not hurt.

43:09.295 --> 43:10.968
- You just said you were hurt.
- I'm not hurt.

43:11.172 --> 43:13.721
- You just said you were hurt.
- I didn't say I was hurt. You said I was hurt.

43:13.925 --> 43:15.768
I asked you if you were hurt
and you said, "Yeah, I'm hurt."

43:15.968 --> 43:17.220
That's because you made me say it.

43:17.428 --> 43:18.896
You're startin'
to put words in my mouth.

43:19.097 --> 43:21.520
Jack, you're a grown man.
You have control over your own words.

43:21.724 --> 43:22.941
You're goddamn right I do.

43:23.101 --> 43:25.399
So here come two words for you:
Shut the fuck up!

43:29.148 --> 43:30.741
Excuse me.

43:30.942 --> 43:33.036
Walsh called Moscone about
a half an hour ago

43:33.194 --> 43:34.411
from outside Toledo.

43:34.612 --> 43:39.038
He's on an interstate Coach Lines bus
headed for Chicago.

43:44.163 --> 43:45.380
Come on.

43:46.082 --> 43:48.255
Sir, what do we do with this guy?

43:48.960 --> 43:50.883
Let him go.

43:55.675 --> 43:58.144
Son of a bitch stole my cigarettes.

43:58.803 --> 44:01.272
When's the last time
you had a chest X-ray?

44:04.016 --> 44:05.893
You know about secondary smoke?

44:06.102 --> 44:08.070
You could give people lung cancer

44:08.271 --> 44:11.275
who are innocent
and trying to live healthy lives.

44:11.607 --> 44:15.032
Why don't you just go back to sleep?
Leave me alone.

44:15.278 --> 44:17.656
- Do whatever you have to do.
- Put the cigarette out.

44:17.864 --> 44:19.787
Why don't you shut up
and leave me alone?

44:19.991 --> 44:21.834
Put the cigarette out, Jack.

44:24.328 --> 44:26.171
Put the cigarette out.

44:26.747 --> 44:28.920
What a pain in the ass this guy is.

44:29.375 --> 44:30.672
Thank you, thank you.

44:30.877 --> 44:34.381
- I thought you were putting it out.
- No, I'm not putting it out.

44:34.881 --> 44:37.760
Why aren't you popular
with the Chicago Police Department?

44:39.802 --> 44:41.725
Sid's downstairs.

44:46.475 --> 44:48.648
- What's up?
- I think you and I should talk.

44:48.853 --> 44:50.605
Why are you hangin' around for?
Take a walk.

44:50.813 --> 44:52.486
I heard somebody picked up Mardukas
in New York.

44:52.648 --> 44:54.901
- It's old news, Sidney. I'm already on it.
- I don't have to tell you

44:55.109 --> 44:56.486
<i>what)“ happen if he becomes
a government witness.</i>

44:56.694 --> 44:58.071
I can assure you that
will not be the case.

44:58.279 --> 45:00.452
I assumed you were
taking that position

45:00.656 --> 45:02.624
but I am supposed to advise you
against such action.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.327
Sidney, relax.
Have a cream soda.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.879
Everything is gonna be
all over within a few minutes.

45:40.988 --> 45:43.241
[sirens wailing]

45:49.121 --> 45:50.919
Who the fuck are these guys?

45:52.124 --> 45:53.671
Hands on the bus!

45:58.923 --> 46:00.550
All right, spread 'em.

46:06.847 --> 46:08.474
It's the fuckin' feds.

46:10.351 --> 46:11.944
Remember me?

46:13.938 --> 46:15.656
Agent Foster Grant.

46:15.856 --> 46:18.359
Alonzo, aren't you gonna thank me
for doin' your job for you?

46:20.736 --> 46:22.409
Thank you, Walsh.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.411
[gunshots]

46:31.580 --> 46:32.957
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Come on!

46:50.016 --> 46:52.485
- What the hell are you doing?
- Keep moving.

46:53.102 --> 46:55.696
What? No, no!

47:00.860 --> 47:05.206
Wait a minute. Jesus Christ!
All right, I'm comin'!

47:05.448 --> 47:08.327
- Come on!
- All right! Wait a minute!

47:10.411 --> 47:13.335
Walsh, you son of a bitch!

47:22.840 --> 47:24.513
- My God, my God!
- Shut up.

47:24.717 --> 47:26.094
- What the hell was that?
- Shut up.

47:26.302 --> 47:28.725
- Why were they shooting?
- Those are Serrano's people back there.

47:28.929 --> 47:30.852
They're not even waiting
for you to get to jail.

47:31.057 --> 47:33.651
You're turnin' me in.
Why are we runnin' away from the FBI?

47:33.851 --> 47:36.525
'Cause I gotta bring you back myself,
otherwise I won't get my money.

47:36.729 --> 47:38.026
I won't give you to the feds.

47:40.066 --> 47:42.660
"Alonzo Mosely."
Isn't that the name you've been using?

47:42.860 --> 47:44.282
Let me see that.

47:47.365 --> 47:49.333
- Look at this wealth of information.
- What?

47:49.533 --> 47:51.706
They got a tap on Moscone's line.

47:53.621 --> 47:55.043
Son of a bitch!

47:56.957 --> 47:59.631
What are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

48:01.295 --> 48:04.265
How far do you think we're
gonna get in a stolen FBI car?

48:06.967 --> 48:08.139
What's that for?

48:08.344 --> 48:10.563
An inside joke between me and Alonzo.

48:11.430 --> 48:13.979
- Tony Darvo, line one.
- Yeah?

48:14.183 --> 48:16.060
Sorry, Jimmy. It didn't happen.

48:17.103 --> 48:18.901
It didn't happen?
Say that again, Tony?

48:19.105 --> 48:20.106
<i>It just didn't happen.</i>

48:20.314 --> 48:21.861
I mean, there were cops all over the place.

48:22.066 --> 48:23.864
There were a million
fuckin' feds all over.

48:24.026 --> 48:25.869
Jimmy, it was... it was a mess.

48:26.028 --> 48:27.996
- It was a real mess.
- You'd better get off the line, Jimmy.

48:28.239 --> 48:31.834
- If they've got a tap on that line--
- Sidney, shut your fucking mouth!

48:32.993 --> 48:34.336
Now listen to me, dummy.

48:34.537 --> 48:37.040
Do they have Mardukas
in custody or not?

48:37.039 --> 48:38.006
I don't, I don't, I don't know.

48:38.207 --> 48:40.335
Jimmy, I don't know. The cops
are swarming all over the place.

48:40.584 --> 48:41.836
<i>We couldn't see anything.</i>

48:42.002 --> 48:44.004
Let me tell you two stupid
motherfuckers something.

48:44.213 --> 48:46.716
I don't want to get another
phone call like this, because

48:46.924 --> 48:50.053
if I do I'll get on a fuckin' plane,
and I'm gonna blowtorch the both of you.

48:50.261 --> 48:51.683
Do you understand?

48:52.138 --> 48:53.640
Are you gonna stop? I'm on the phone!

48:53.848 --> 48:55.225
I'm talking to Jimmy.
What are you doin'?

48:55.766 --> 48:58.315
I should've killed Walsh
in Chicago a long time ago.

48:58.686 --> 49:01.280
Don't say a word to me, Sidney.
Don't say a fuckin' word to me.

49:01.480 --> 49:04.074
I'll get up and I'll bury
this telephone in your head.

49:29.842 --> 49:30.843
I can't believe this.

49:31.051 --> 49:34.225
I haven't seen either of them in nine years
and the first thing outta my mouth is gonna be:

49:34.430 --> 49:36.432
"Can I borrow a few hundred bucks?"

49:36.640 --> 49:39.610
I have a feeling this is going
to be very good for you.

49:47.109 --> 49:48.952
[bell rings]

49:52.490 --> 49:54.333
You look fine.

49:58.746 --> 50:00.168
<i>Who are you Ql-“ls?</i>

50:01.040 --> 50:03.042
I'm your mother's ex-husband.

50:05.085 --> 50:08.305
- Mom!
- Nice kid.

50:18.349 --> 50:19.646
Hi, Gail.

50:20.226 --> 50:22.069
- Hello.
- How're you doin'?

50:22.645 --> 50:24.022
I'm doin' good.

50:28.651 --> 50:29.618
Hi.

50:30.736 --> 50:32.704
They mentioned you and him
on the news this morning.

50:32.905 --> 50:34.282
- They did?
- Yeah.

50:35.449 --> 50:37.372
What did they say? Anything good?

50:37.576 --> 50:39.294
[chuckles]

50:39.453 --> 50:42.332
No. Are you all right?

50:43.040 --> 50:44.337
Yeah.

50:45.626 --> 50:47.799
You're in a lot of trouble, Jack.

50:49.588 --> 50:51.886
Can I come in for a few minutes, Gail?

50:54.009 --> 50:56.057
Can I come in for a few minutes?

50:57.596 --> 50:59.348
Yeah.

51:02.142 --> 51:03.109
I won't stay long.

51:03.310 --> 51:05.859
I just need to borrow
some money to get to LA.

51:06.397 --> 51:08.024
You know I'm good for it.

51:08.816 --> 51:11.535
Jack, I don't think I have
that kind of cash in the house.

51:11.735 --> 51:15.581
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm just in a jam, Gail.

51:17.783 --> 51:19.330
You look beautiful.

51:20.286 --> 51:22.209
You don't look much like a criminal.

51:22.413 --> 51:23.630
I'm a white-collar criminal.

51:23.831 --> 51:25.458
Jason, go upstairs now.

51:29.253 --> 51:30.755
Jack, you shouldn't be here.

51:31.046 --> 51:33.720
If Ted comes home,
he's gonna arrest you and him.

51:33.924 --> 51:35.767
- Arrest us?
- Yeah.

51:36.969 --> 51:40.189
Then we'd really be in a lot of trouble 'cause
I'm afraid I'm a little short of bribe money.

51:40.389 --> 51:42.892
All right, Jack, don't start.
Please, don't.

51:43.100 --> 51:45.228
How is Lieutenant
whatever-his-name-is?

51:45.436 --> 51:48.064
- It's captain now.
- Captain? Royalty.

51:48.272 --> 51:50.866
Jack, I don't want any trouble.
Do you understand that?

51:51.066 --> 51:53.569
Please, it is not a good day for this.
I mean it.

51:53.777 --> 51:55.199
I'm sorry that my fugitive timetable

51:55.404 --> 51:57.406
doesn't coincide
with your social calendar.

51:57.615 --> 51:59.743
- I don't think she was saying that.
- Stay out of this, Jon.

51:59.950 --> 52:00.621
Alright, same old Jack,

52:00.826 --> 52:03.955
you get your feelings hurt and then you
just walk around and hurt everybody else.

52:03.954 --> 52:05.251
The last thing I need now is one of your lectures!

52:05.247 --> 52:06.965
I'm not lecturing you, stupid!
I'm trying to protect you!

52:07.207 --> 52:09.335
- Come on!
- Ted is gonna be home any minute.

52:09.543 --> 52:11.386
We're all going out.
It's an important night for us.

52:11.879 --> 52:13.802
Important night? What's so important
about tonight? Wait, let me guess.

52:14.006 --> 52:16.555
- What is it, payoff night?
- Alright, that's it! Get out!

52:16.759 --> 52:19.933
- Let's not fight.
- Gail, listen! I'm in a big fuckin' jam!

52:19.928 --> 52:22.056
I just need to borrow some money
so I can get this guy back to LA

52:22.264 --> 52:24.016
and I'm out of this
miserable fucking business forever!

52:24.266 --> 52:26.018
Can't you understand that?

52:44.286 --> 52:45.458
Hi.

52:48.415 --> 52:49.917
Denise?

52:54.630 --> 52:56.428
You got so big.

53:13.107 --> 53:15.951
- I'm sorry. I'm gonna go now. I'm sorry.
- No, hold on.

53:22.533 --> 53:25.662
I'm sorry, honey.
It's just, we're havin' a...

53:34.044 --> 53:35.762
What grade are you in now?

53:35.921 --> 53:36.888
Eighth.

53:37.089 --> 53:38.887
Are you in the eighth grade?

53:59.737 --> 54:03.458
Here's $40. That's all I've got,
but these are the keys to my car.

54:03.657 --> 54:05.330
It's the station wagon
in the driveway.

54:05.534 --> 54:08.037
- I'll tell Ted that it's in the shop.
- Okay.

54:08.287 --> 54:11.166
And we'll worry about it
when you get back to LA.

54:12.291 --> 54:14.339
So, does he take good care of you?

54:17.588 --> 54:20.011
Yeah?
Well, that's all I wanted to know.

54:21.425 --> 54:23.519
So what's he gonna say about this?

54:24.762 --> 54:28.357
- He'll understand.
- Yeah, that's love, y'know?

54:29.975 --> 54:31.602
Bye, honey.

55:09.306 --> 55:10.649
Wait.

55:11.475 --> 55:13.944
It isn't much.
About $180 babysitting money.

55:14.144 --> 55:16.192
- Sweetheart, I can't.
- Take it.

55:16.396 --> 55:18.569
- I can't.
- Please.

55:20.108 --> 55:22.327
- Take it.
- I can't, sweetheart.

55:56.270 --> 56:00.571
Hello. I'd like to make a collect call
to an Eddie Moscone from a Jack Walsh.

56:00.983 --> 56:03.782
[phone rings]

56:04.069 --> 56:05.446
Moscone's Bail Bonds.

56:05.654 --> 56:07.201
Jerry, Jack, put Eddie on the phone.

56:07.573 --> 56:08.950
Eddie, it's Jack.

56:09.491 --> 56:11.414
Jack, stop fuckin' around.
Where are you?

56:11.618 --> 56:14.041
Where am I? I'm in Boise, Idaho.

56:14.371 --> 56:16.590
No,no, no, wait a minute.
I'm in Anchorage, Alaska.

56:16.832 --> 56:19.051
No, no, no, wait.
I'm in Casper, Wyoming.

56:19.293 --> 56:22.638
I'm in the lobby of a Howard Johnson's
and I'm wearing a pink carnation.

56:22.838 --> 56:24.681
What the fuck
are you talkin' about?

56:24.882 --> 56:27.180
I'm not talkin' to you.
I'm talkin' to the other guys.

56:27.426 --> 56:28.552
What other guys?

56:28.760 --> 56:31.434
Let me describe the scene to you.
There's these guys, see.

56:31.638 --> 56:33.311
They've probably been up
for like two days.

56:33.515 --> 56:35.734
They stink of B.0.
They have coffee breath.

56:35.976 --> 56:38.855
They're constipated from sitting
on their asses for so long.

56:39.104 --> 56:41.106
They're sitting in a van
and they're probably parked

56:41.315 --> 56:42.737
right up the street
from your office.

56:42.941 --> 56:45.820
But now, you guys, you're gonna
have to pack up all your shit and go home,

56:46.028 --> 56:48.497
<i>because I'm onto you, you dumb fucks.</i>

56:48.697 --> 56:50.119
<i>Eddie, your phone is tapped.</i>

56:50.282 --> 56:53.286
<i>Listen, I'm not going to use
this line anymore. Go to Chin Loo 's.</i>

56:53.493 --> 56:56.372
I'll call you there in five minutes.
They can't run a tap that fast.

56:56.580 --> 56:58.002
So long, everybody.

56:58.707 --> 57:00.926
[phone rings]

57:01.460 --> 57:05.055
Excuse me, buddy. I got it, I got it, I got it!
I think it's for me. Jack, that you?

57:05.255 --> 57:07.633
Listen, I need you to wire me $500
to the Western Union office

57:07.883 --> 57:09.351
in Amarillo, Texas right away.

57:09.551 --> 57:11.849
Wait a minute. What do you
need with $500 on a bus?

57:12.054 --> 57:13.977
And why the fuck
aren't you on a plane?

57:14.181 --> 57:16.275
Did it ever occur to you
that I am a professional

57:16.433 --> 57:17.355
and that I might have my reasons?

57:17.601 --> 57:20.730
We are driving now, and I only have
enough cash to get to Amarillo.

57:20.938 --> 57:22.281
We had to scrap the bus.

57:22.481 --> 57:25.109
Fuck the bus! I wanna know
what happened to the goddamn plane!

57:26.610 --> 57:29.739
- He doesn't like to fly.
- He doesn't like to fly?

57:29.947 --> 57:32.416
What the fuck does that mean?
Listen to me, Jack!

57:32.616 --> 57:35.460
You gotta be back here in less
than two and a half fucking days.

57:35.661 --> 57:39.541
A half million dollars of my money!
What the fuck is goin' on there?

57:39.539 --> 57:43.089
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, I swear to God, don't start
with me now or I will shoot him

57:43.335 --> 57:45.804
and I will dump him
in a fuckin' swamp!

57:46.922 --> 57:48.344
I am in no fuckin' mood for this.

57:48.548 --> 57:50.926
Just send me the money and
I'll have him back by the deadline.

57:51.134 --> 57:53.011
- You hear me?
- Yes.

57:54.012 --> 57:55.480
Let's go.

57:57.766 --> 58:01.691
Jerry, wire $500 to Jack Walsh
in Amarillo, Texas right away.

58:01.895 --> 58:04.023
Amarillo, Texas. Now, listen.

58:04.398 --> 58:07.698
Also, get Dorfler down there!
Find him and get him down there, too.

58:08.026 --> 58:10.028
- You got it, Eddie.
- Shit!

58:10.237 --> 58:12.035
[door slams]

58:12.531 --> 58:15.159
<i>[Jon singing] If one of those bottles
of beer should fall,</i>

58:15.367 --> 58:18.541
<i>96 bottles
of beer on the wall.</i>

58:18.745 --> 58:21.624
<i>96 bottles of beer on the wall,</i>

58:21.832 --> 58:26.804
Ba-ba-boom.
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-boom.

58:27.129 --> 58:28.927
Nine...

58:31.633 --> 58:36.230
93 bottles of beer on the wall.

58:38.807 --> 58:42.232
Why were you so unpopular
with the Chicago Police Department?

58:43.103 --> 58:44.901
'Cause of your personality?

58:47.441 --> 58:50.741
What happened back at your house?
What was that all about?

58:51.194 --> 58:53.788
Your wife married
a corrupt police officer?

58:57.117 --> 58:58.664
What was it all about?

59:01.621 --> 59:03.794
That whole fuckin' department
was corrupt.

59:04.041 --> 59:06.043
There's good and bad everywhere,
don't you think?

59:06.251 --> 59:09.505
I'd say there's bad everywhere.
Good I don't know about.

59:13.175 --> 59:14.768
What happened to you?

59:19.681 --> 59:21.604
I wouldn't go on the payroll.

59:23.185 --> 59:24.732
What payroll?

59:26.354 --> 59:28.072
I was workin' undercover.

59:28.273 --> 59:32.574
I was close to this guy,
this big heroin dealer in Chicago.

59:32.819 --> 59:34.947
He supplied the whole city.

59:35.739 --> 59:38.288
Took me a year just
to get his confidence.

59:39.076 --> 59:43.001
Just when I was about to nail the son
of a bitch my fellow officers

59:43.246 --> 59:46.921
mysteriously discovered seven pounds
of heroin in my house.

59:47.417 --> 59:50.512
So this big-time drug dealer
gave me a choice:

59:50.754 --> 59:52.927
Get on the payroll
like everybody else,

59:53.131 --> 59:55.725
get out of town,
or go to jail for 30 years.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.603
Well, I didn't get on the payroll.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:00.806
And that's why I do this.

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:04.439
When I find a criminal like you,
I bring him in.

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:07.146
I don't have to worry
about anybody takin' a payoff

01:00:07.354 --> 01:00:09.573
because there is no anybody.
There's just me.

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:21.494
Why don't you
get yourself a new watch?

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:23.704
I'll tell you when I know you better.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:26.586
When you know me better? When will you get
to know me better? I'll get to know you better.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:29.134
- You're not gonna get to know me better.
- Will you shut up?

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:30.711
That's what I mean.

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:53.492
How much money do we have left?

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:58.989
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:01:00.574 --> 01:01:02.702
We're starvin',
and you're buying cigarettes?

01:01:02.909 --> 01:01:04.252
I need these cigarettes.

01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:07.001
You can have your whatever
you're gonna have, I'll have this.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:08.965
What can I do for you boys?

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:10.292
Coffee, please.

01:01:14.337 --> 01:01:16.760
- How much is the coffee?
- It's 53 cents.

01:01:17.007 --> 01:01:19.430
- How much is tea?
- 53 cents.

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:24.310
I'll have tea.

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:27.184
Our breakfast special today
is chorizo and eggs.

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:29.736
- Chorizo and eggs?
- Chorizo and eggs. Yes.

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:32.072
- What is that?
- It's a Mexican sausage

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:35.276
mixed in with scrambled eggs.
It comes with hash browns and toast.

01:01:35.483 --> 01:01:37.656
We won't be havin' that. Thank you.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.122
What time you got?

01:01:47.495 --> 01:01:48.417
Ten to nine.

01:01:48.622 --> 01:01:51.592
Alright, in 10 minutes we'll be
at the Western Union office, we'll have $500,

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:54.924
and I'll buy you a nice juicy steak
or whatever you want, okay?

01:01:56.004 --> 01:01:58.883
- Chorizo and eggs?
- Huh?

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:01.431
- Chorizo and eggs?
- I'll get you whatever you want.

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:06.147
You know, Jon,

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:08.851
you're in this mess
because you're in this mess.

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.610
I didn't put you in this mess.

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:12.274
Do you understand?

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:13.776
Yeah.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.610
If you had left Jimmy Serrano alone,
this wouldn't be happening.

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:21.950
Thank you.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:24.449
Thank you.

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:26.664
I had a way out of this, you know.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:29.124
Oh, yeah
7?

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:32.086
What's the thing
Serrano's most afraid of?

01:02:35.001 --> 01:02:37.299
<i>Gain' cross-country with you.</i>

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:43.977
Gettin' knocked off by his own people.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:47.522
What I know about
his financial transactions

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:50.976
could not only put him away but
every mob guy he ever did business with.

01:02:51.226 --> 01:02:53.274
That's why he wants to kill me.

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:56.611
I was gonna put all his records
on computer disks.

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:59.902
I figured if things got too rough
I could always trade them for my life.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:01.032
So what happened?

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:04.706
What happened was I got arrested
before I had a chance to do it.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.459
Why didn't you just leave him alone?

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:11.205
You don't look like the kind of guy
who'd be involved in that sort of--

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:14.007
Why didn't you just leave
that heroin dealer alone?

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:18.135
I was a mob accountant.

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:21.301
I thought I worked
in a legitimate firm.

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:24.179
When I found out I was managing
accounts that were fronts for Serrano

01:03:24.384 --> 01:03:26.261
I couldn't just sit back and do nothing.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:28.722
Yeah, but Jon, you still took
what didn't belong to you.

01:03:28.930 --> 01:03:30.773
How can you be
on the side of a mobster?

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:33.523
- I'm not on the side of a mobster.
- You're on his side if you're not on my side.

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:35.650
I'm not on anybody's side.
I got nothing to do with it.

01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:37.322
You got everything to do with it.

01:03:37.522 --> 01:03:39.695
You're takin' me to jail
and in jail you know I'll be killed.

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:42.197
- That's not my problem.
- It's not your problem?

01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:44.029
It's not your problem?

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:48.075
Did you read about me in the papers?

01:03:48.533 --> 01:03:50.160
- Yeah, I did.
- Were you on my side then?

01:03:50.368 --> 01:03:52.086
- Yeah, I was.
- Then why aren't you now?

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:54.790
- Because now you're in my way.
- I'm in your way?

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:57.092
What you mean is you want the money
for turning me in

01:03:57.292 --> 01:04:01.342
because that's all you're about.
You're just about the fuckin' money.

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:06.343
Hey, Jon.

01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:08.686
You can think
whatever you want to think.

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:12.812
Doesn't matter to me, 'cause I'm gettin'
my $100,000 any which way you want it.

01:04:21.066 --> 01:04:22.739
Let's go.

01:04:27.197 --> 01:04:29.950
Hey, Tony.
Tony, Hopalong Cassidy.

01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:31.705
You got your camera?
Take a picture.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:33.287
Come on,
they got these at the airport.

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:34.667
Should I get one
on the way back?

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:35.963
Come on. Put that away.

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:38.041
I'm not gonna tell you again.

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:41.632
Tony, there they are.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:53.352
- How you doin', Jack?
- Shit.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:55.149
Jimmy sends his regards.

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:58.228
Don't worry, Jack.

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:01.064
We're not here for you.
We're here for him.

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:04.116
What are you starin' at?

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:05.906
Are you gonna propose?

01:05:08.905 --> 01:05:10.031
Drop 'em!

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:12.459
I said, "Drop 'em," assholes!

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.215
Who the fuck are you guys?

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:20.918
Who the fuck are you?

01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:30.177
You're dead.
You know who you're fuckin' with?

01:05:30.385 --> 01:05:32.479
No. Why don't you tell me about it?

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:35.182
Make sure you speak
into the microphone.

01:05:36.891 --> 01:05:38.313
Marvin, Marvin!

01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:42.488
Very clever, Jack. Now give me the keys.

01:05:43.064 --> 01:05:44.782
Come on! Give me the keys!

01:05:45.692 --> 01:05:47.035
Keys.

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:51.956
Looks like a package deal
to me, Marvin.

01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:54.618
Goddamn it. Come on! Both of you!

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:59.706
Who the hell were those guys?

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:02.008
- Marvin, you did it this time.
- What are you talkin' about?

01:06:02.208 --> 01:06:03.801
Those are hired killers back there.

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:06.425
- Hired to kill who?
- Hired to kill this guy.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:09.303
- Me. Me, can you believe it?
- Hired by who?

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:11.851
Hired by who? Jimmy Serrano.
That's who.

01:06:12.051 --> 01:06:14.145
Oh, fuck.
Why do they want to kill this guy?

01:06:14.345 --> 01:06:16.097
Don't you read the papers,
knucklehead?

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.229
- Yeah, I read the fuckin' papers.
- I can't take this.

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:22.187
They got away. Grey Dodge.
Get after them.

01:06:22.562 --> 01:06:23.859
How the fuck
did you know where we were?

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:26.111
- I can't take this.
- Shut up a minute. Did Eddie put you on this?

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:28.535
- Of course Eddie put me on this.
- That son of a bitch!

01:06:28.735 --> 01:06:31.033
- You know I have a contract with him?
- You got a contract?

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.784
- Yeah, I signed it on Monday.
- He called me in Pittsburgh.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:34.832
He said you were
fucking this thing up.

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:36.376
I'm not fuckin' anything up.

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:38.203
You should've been in LA two days ago.

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:41.335
Hey Marvin, don't tell me how to do my
goddamn job! I'm half-thinkin' not to turn him in

01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:43.633
just to watch Eddie
go down the fuckin' toilet.

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:46.677
- See, that's a good thought.
- What? Who the hell's talkin' to you?

01:06:46.878 --> 01:06:50.223
Yeah, who the fuck's talkin' to you? He's not yours
to take anymore, limpdick. He's mine.

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:52.551
[helicopter approaching]
Do you hear that?

01:06:53.218 --> 01:06:55.346
Fuck! Now who the fuck is this?

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:57.847
[gunfire]

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:01.192
Jesus Christ!

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.362
Do something!

01:07:07.232 --> 01:07:12.079
You guys are the dumbest
bounty hunters I've ever seen!

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:15.995
[gunfire]

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:19.453
You couldn't even
deliver a bottle of milk!

01:07:21.955 --> 01:07:23.502
[gunfire]
[Jon screams]

01:07:23.706 --> 01:07:26.129
Will you shut the fuck up?

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:35.932
Where the hell did he go?

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.727
- You think we lost him?
- I don't know. I don't see anything.

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:42.025
Oh, I'm sure we're completely safe.

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:45.771
[screams]
[gunfire]

01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:51.655
[horn honks]

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:53.657
[tires screech]

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:08.255
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm enjoying it.

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:11.297
- Marvin, Marvin, give me a gun.
- No fuckin' way!

01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:13.761
[gunfire]

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:19.520
- Will you give me a fucking gun?
- Give him a gun, Marvin!

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.223
Don't fuck me, Jack!

01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:22.557
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.563
[gunfire]

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:32.692
Shit.

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:38.032
They're not after me.
Just kidding, just kidding.

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:40.912
- Thought you threw those away.
- Always check the evidence, Marvin.

01:08:41.117 --> 01:08:42.663
Those were car keys.

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:48.582
[screams]

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:52.258
[gunfire]

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.965
Son of a bitch! There goes $100,000.

01:08:55.173 --> 01:08:57.846
$100,000? Eddie was gonna
pay you $100,000?

01:08:58.009 --> 01:09:00.728
. Why? What was he gonna pay you?
<i>'</i> $25,000.

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.272
Son of a bitch!

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:17.370
[gunfire]

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:35.380
Holy shit, Jack! You got him!

01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:38.011
[laughs]

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:40.014
Marvin!

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:53.402
What the hell are you doin', Jack?

01:09:56.859 --> 01:09:58.327
See you in LA, Marvin.

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:53.170
[Jack]: Jon! Jon!

01:10:53.916 --> 01:10:57.386
Jon! Where the fuck are you, Jon?

01:10:59.547 --> 01:11:03.927
Give me your hand. I'm slippery.
I can't hold on. Give me your hand.

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:10.232
<i>Where are you gain'?</i>

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:12.522
Jon!

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:16.314
Jon!

01:11:19.734 --> 01:11:20.986
Good.

01:11:22.653 --> 01:11:23.950
- Promise you'll let me go?
- What?

01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:26.950
Do you promise to let me go?

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:29.877
Fuck you!

01:11:30.036 --> 01:11:32.084
- Promise to let me go!
- Fuck you.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:35.918
You're making it very difficult for me
to do the right thing here.

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:42.303
All right. I promise I'll let you go.

01:12:00.107 --> 01:12:01.575
Jesus.

01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:03.823
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.951
Thanks for saving my life.

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:12.461
Thanks for lettin' me go.

01:12:15.623 --> 01:12:19.719
I'll let you go, all right.
The second you're in LA County Jail.

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:21.925
Come on.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:28.807
Yeah, that's right. Down here!

01:12:29.428 --> 01:12:31.681
Are you gonna stand there
with your thumb up your ass

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:33.732
or are you gonna get me
the fuck out of here?

01:12:41.315 --> 01:12:42.908
This just came in.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:46.488
Is this gonna upset me?

01:12:46.696 --> 01:12:49.449
I think it's safe to say that.

01:12:50.825 --> 01:12:55.626
Are you familiar with a dish,
a potato dish, lyonnaise potato?

01:12:55.788 --> 01:13:00.009
It's a kind of fried potato.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.883
But it's got, like, an onion in it.
It's quite delicious.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:08.518
It really goes beautifully
with steak, chops,

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:11.767
you know, hamburger, cheeseburger,
any of your meat dishes.

01:13:11.971 --> 01:13:13.473
It's just a...

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:16.354
You know, I have... I have
enough money to buy

01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:18.982
- Look.
- ...as much lyonnaise potatoes

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:22.816
- ...as you ever would enjoy.
- Just shut the fuck up, will you, please?

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:24.859
I just think you ought
to think about it a little bit,

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:27.074
because it's nothing...

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:29.952
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

01:13:30.197 --> 01:13:34.998
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Thank you. Very much.

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:36.917
Cover that.

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.926
Hi, you think you could give us
a ride to the next town?

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:44.837
- Sure. Jump in the back.
- Thanks a lot.

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:48.929
Great, great. See? For every shit,
there's six nice people.

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:52.053
- Jahé, everyone. Jahé.
- Jahé.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.183
What's that?

01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:56.391
It's "Hello." I can say "Hello"
in a lot of different languages.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:13:58.897
Not yours, but a lot of them.

01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:05.950
Welcome, sir.

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:13.825
- I'm not lookin' forward to this.
- What, do you think I am?

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:15.664
I don't understand the problem
with you two.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:16.994
The guy's a fuckin' accountant.

01:14:17.203 --> 01:14:18.420
Jimmy, it's been bad luck
right down the line.

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:19.873
Plus this guy Walsh is pretty good.

01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:22.167
If he's that good, Tony,
maybe I should hire him to hit you.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:24.753
I hope there's no chance of any
of this coming back to Jimmy.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:27.180
No chance.
Rented the chopper out of Kansas City.

01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:29.970
He's five times removed from you.
So you're clear of this. Don't worry.

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:33.144
Clear as shit, you fuckin' moron!
The guy is still out there, ain't he?

01:14:33.344 --> 01:14:34.971
Let me tell you two guys somethin'.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:37.815
I'm not interested in seein'
either of you two alive again

01:14:37.974 --> 01:14:40.272
until you get the accountant,
you got the message?

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:52.864
[chickens squawking]

01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:57.910
It's the end of the ride.

01:14:58.077 --> 01:14:59.750
- This is it?
- This is it.

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:02.958
Is there a real... a real town
around here someplace?

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:04.917
- Channing.
- Channing?

01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:06.051
Yeah.

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:07.469
How far is that from here?

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:11.470
- Thirty miles.
- Thirty miles. Jesus Christ.

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:18.269
[chickens clucking]

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:21.771
What the hell kind of town is this?

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.823
Is there someone that can give us
a ride to Channing?

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:38.163
Is there anyone going
in that direction?

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:39.584
No, don't have a ride.

01:15:39.827 --> 01:15:40.669
Excuse me a minute.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.918
Is there a bathroom
in there I could use?

01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.297
Yeah, go ahead.

01:15:45.332 --> 01:15:47.084
Is there a telephone here?

01:15:48.169 --> 01:15:50.638
- Telephone.
- No, no, no telephone.

01:15:50.838 --> 01:15:52.556
No telephone? Nothing.

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:55.055
[speaking other language]

01:15:55.259 --> 01:15:57.853
[all laughing]

01:16:01.849 --> 01:16:03.977
Glad you're all havin' a good time.

01:16:05.352 --> 01:16:07.775
[engine sputtering]

01:16:29.043 --> 01:16:31.421
Fear of flying, you son of a bitch?

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:34.473
Get over here!
Get back here, you son of a bitch!

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:38.178
Get over here! Stop!

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:40.521
Stop!

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:47.979
Fear of flying my ass,
you son of a bitch!

01:16:48.187 --> 01:16:49.154
Get out of that plane!

01:16:51.107 --> 01:16:53.360
You're a goddamn pilot,
you son of a bitch?

01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:56.571
I didn't feel it was appropriate
to share that with you, Jack.

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:58.622
I'm gonna fucking appropriate
your head, goddamn it.

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:00.291
How do you turn this
fucking thing off?

01:17:03.702 --> 01:17:06.751
Turn it off!
Turn it off!

01:17:07.081 --> 01:17:09.834
Hang in there!
I'm gonna let it down easy!

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:17.638
Turn this fucking thing off!

01:17:21.095 --> 01:17:22.938
Oh, shit!

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:39.955
Pilot? You're a goddamn pilot?

01:17:40.114 --> 01:17:42.617
You're a pilot?
Here, I'll show you a pilot.

01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.581
Let me tell you
about the coffee shop

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:46.458
I'm gonna open up
after I dump you off

01:17:46.662 --> 01:17:48.756
and get my $100,000.
You're gonna love it.

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:55.296
All right, get back!
Get back! Get back!

01:17:55.504 --> 01:17:56.801
Everybody back, back!

01:17:57.381 --> 01:18:00.260
- Give me the keys to the truck.
- You can't steal their truck.

01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:01.935
Shut up!
You were about to steal a plane!

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:04.847
- What are you talking about?
- I'm trying to save my life!

01:18:05.014 --> 01:18:06.231
You're right,
I should give them something.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:07.433
Give me your watch.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:09.518
- My watch? Shit!
- Give me your watch!

01:18:09.977 --> 01:18:12.400
Keep it. It's worth a lot of money.

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:13.447
Get in.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:15.065
Stand back!

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:16.526
Get in.

01:18:17.151 --> 01:18:18.323
Get in!

01:18:21.238 --> 01:18:22.990
Jack, let's be fair about this.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.792
You lied to me first.

01:18:24.992 --> 01:18:27.916
- At the river.
- What? Get the fuck--

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.839
- At the river!
- You lied to me first.

01:18:30.998 --> 01:18:34.377
- You got some fuckin' nerve!
- No. You lied to me first.

01:18:34.627 --> 01:18:36.675
You lied to me first.

01:18:38.505 --> 01:18:41.930
Yes, yes, I lied to you first
but you had no knowledge

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:44.102
I was lying about my fear of flying

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.388
at the river when you lied to me.

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:49.525
So as far as you knew,
you lied to me first.

01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:53.320
Can't even argue with you.
I don't even know what the fuck you're talking about.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.569
I'm just saying you lied to me first
as far as you knew.

01:18:56.774 --> 01:18:57.525
Jesus.

01:18:57.733 --> 01:18:59.485
- What's the matter?
- I got an ulcer.

01:18:59.693 --> 01:19:01.115
- An ulcer?
- Yeah, I got an ulcer.

01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:02.287
I got a big fucking ulcer,

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:04.536
and all your bullshit
started to make it bleed again.

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:05.957
You know why you have an ulcer?

01:19:06.116 --> 01:19:07.834
Because you have
two forms of expression:

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:09.995
Silence and rage.

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:16.085
You should get some milk
to coat it.

01:19:16.293 --> 01:19:17.761
Don't tell me what I need.

01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:19.179
I need something to eat,
that's what I need.

01:19:19.421 --> 01:19:21.594
What are we gonna buy it with? Dirt?

01:19:22.049 --> 01:19:24.017
You drive to the next town.
I'll take care of it.

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:25.219
- You'll take care of it?
- I'll take care of it.

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:26.595
What do you mean,
you'll take care of it?

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:27.930
Drive to the next town.

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:32.526
But you lied to me first.

01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:44.872
- Now what?
- Give me that FBI badge.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:50.036
- The FBI badge?
- Yeah, give me the FBI badge.

01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:01.171
Uncuff me.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.927
- Uncuff you?
- Uncuff me.

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:06.514
Want to eat? Want a nice meal?

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:11.057
Want some of that shit you eat?
Come on. Uncuff me.

01:20:18.439 --> 01:20:19.440
You fuck with me--

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:22.618
And you'll hit me on the head
and drop me in a thing.

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:24.445
Right. Come on.
Uncuff me.

01:20:32.995 --> 01:20:34.963
- Who's in charge here?
- Who wants to know?

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:38.043
- Me.
- That'd be the manager.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.419
I'd like to see the manager
as soon as possible.

01:20:40.627 --> 01:20:42.095
Yes, sir.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.598
Sorry.

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:59.071
- Yeah?
- Alonzo Mosely, FBI.

01:21:00.647 --> 01:21:02.524
My partner and I have been
tracking a ring of counterfeiters

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:05.236
passing phony $20 bills
across the state.

01:21:05.444 --> 01:21:08.243
Have you received any $20 bills
in the last couple of hours?

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:10.916
Yeah, sure,
we get 'em all the time.

01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:18.208
You get them all the time. Would
you mind taking two steps backwards?

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:22.636
Would you mind opening the register?

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:26.803
No, don't touch them.

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.051
Excuse me.

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:32.308
Contract two, Hank. Check 'em out.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.523
Give him a pencil, please.

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:44.108
Do the litmus configuration.

01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:47.778
Doing the litmus configuration?

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:49.738
- Litmus configuration.
- Yes.

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:58.000
You seen any suspicious-looking
characters around here?

01:21:58.205 --> 01:21:59.548
Nope.

01:21:59.873 --> 01:22:02.672
- Do you live around here?
- Yep.

01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:09.554
- How does it look?
- This one's bad.

01:22:12.928 --> 01:22:14.930
Would you describe exactly
what the last man

01:22:15.222 --> 01:22:17.645
who passed a $20 bill
to you looked like?

01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:19.944
- Thirty. Tall.
- About 6 feet tall?

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:21.900
<i>_</i> 6! 5"-
- Dark brown hair?

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:23.523
Light colored.

01:22:24.189 --> 01:22:26.032
- Sounds like our man.
- That's him.

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:28.152
We're gonna take
these bills for evidence.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.236
Make them a receipt.

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:30.992
- This one's bad, too.
- This one's bad, too.

01:22:31.196 --> 01:22:32.948
I'd like you to notify all
the other establishments

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:34.116
in the area of this situation.

01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:35.701
What's the name of your establishment?

01:22:35.909 --> 01:22:37.252
- Red's Corner Bar.
- Are you Red?

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:39.171
Yes, sir.

01:22:39.371 --> 01:22:40.918
Do you dye your hair?

01:22:41.081 --> 01:22:42.048
No.

01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:43.626
Why do they call you "Red"?

01:22:43.834 --> 01:22:46.553
It's short for Redwood.
My last name's Wood.

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:49.013
- What's your first name?
- Bill.

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:54.144
Thank you for your cooperation, Bill.

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:55.725
Hank.

01:22:57.764 --> 01:23:00.142
These are all bad. Those are good.

01:23:15.574 --> 01:23:17.793
- Come on. We're gonna get this train.
- What?

01:23:17.993 --> 01:23:19.586
We're gonna catch this train.
Come on.

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:21.171
I can't catch a train.

01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:23.169
You also couldn't fly.
Start running. Let's go.

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:26.047
Wait a minute. Wait!
It's a freight train!

01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:30.931
I can't do this!
I can't do this!

01:23:39.556 --> 01:23:41.650
I deeply feel I can't do this.

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:43.227
I thought you liked
to travel by train.

01:23:43.435 --> 01:23:44.857
Get up there!

01:23:51.235 --> 01:23:53.363
- What are you doing?
- Promise to let me go?

01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:56.619
- Open the fuckin' door!
- See you in the next life, Jack.

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:58.830
Son of a bitch!

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:01.662
You son of a bitch!
Open that fuckin' door!

01:24:15.842 --> 01:24:17.344
Glad to see me?

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:20.184
I guess we're in the next life, Jon.

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:22.687
- Don't overreact now.
- Don't overreact?

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:25.644
I won't overreact! Get over here!
Overreact?

01:24:25.852 --> 01:24:28.651
You do this again,
I'll throw you off the fuckin' train!

01:24:29.982 --> 01:24:31.404
Jack, Jack, it's a bad--

01:24:31.608 --> 01:24:33.531
Get down there!
Put your hand in there!

01:24:33.735 --> 01:24:35.362
- Easy, Jack. Easy, easy.
- There.

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:37.615
You son of a bitch!

01:24:40.951 --> 01:24:42.624
- Jack?
- You shut up!

01:24:42.828 --> 01:24:45.047
I'm not talking to you
for the whole rest of this trip!

01:24:48.625 --> 01:24:51.925
Hey, you guys gonna let me go or what?
I'm telling you I don't know anything.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:53.304
Is that a fact?

01:24:54.298 --> 01:24:55.641
Oh, shit.

01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:06.401
Why don't you quit?
It'd be cheaper for both of us.

01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:14.822
Where are they?

01:25:15.027 --> 01:25:16.199
You got me.

01:25:17.237 --> 01:25:18.864
- Inspector.
- Shut up.

01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:20.954
Now you listen, you son of a bitch.

01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:22.876
I want answers
and I want them right now.

01:25:23.035 --> 01:25:24.708
What do you want from me?
I don't know nothin'.

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:31.339
Sir...

01:25:32.044 --> 01:25:35.969
It seems that an Agent Alonzo Mosely
and his partner

01:25:36.214 --> 01:25:39.639
were seen hopping a westbound
freight train near Channing.

01:25:42.262 --> 01:25:43.730
Come on.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.396
[horn sounds]

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:02.207
- Jack?
- What?

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:06.954
How much further
do you think we have to go?

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:09.210
[imitating Jack]
None of your fuckin' business!

01:26:09.414 --> 01:26:11.633
You know, because eventually
I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom.

01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:13.172
[imitating Jack]
Shut the fuck up!

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:21.928
Did you ever have sex
with an animal, Jack?

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:28.484
Remember those chickens
around the Indian reservation?

01:26:28.684 --> 01:26:30.607
<i>There were some good-Rankin'
chickens there, Jack.</i>

01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:32.438
You know, between us.

01:26:32.729 --> 01:26:35.778
Yeah, there were a couple there
I might have taken a shot at.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.868
What's with you and that watch?
What is it with the watch?

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.907
You told me when you
get to know me better.

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:46.202
You told me about your feelings
for chickens.

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:49.584
How private could the watch be?
What's the big secret?

01:26:54.126 --> 01:26:56.629
Gail bought me this watch.
She gave it to me.

01:26:56.837 --> 01:26:58.931
It was the first thing
she ever gave me.

01:27:02.759 --> 01:27:06.935
She, uh... she bought it
because I was always late

01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:08.812
by at least a half an hour.

01:27:08.974 --> 01:27:13.775
So she bought it and set it ahead
a half an hour so I'd never be late.

01:27:22.779 --> 01:27:24.076
Somewhere in the back of my mind

01:27:24.281 --> 01:27:25.954
I keep thinking we're gonna
wind up together again.

01:27:26.116 --> 01:27:29.416
I don't know why I'm still hanging on.
I'm still waitin' around.

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:36.510
<i>1 don't think she's cumin' back.</i>

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:40.634
Yeah, I don't either.

01:27:41.423 --> 01:27:42.891
I don't either.

01:27:45.051 --> 01:27:47.304
Sometimes you just have to let go.

01:27:50.432 --> 01:27:52.309
Just get yourself a new watch.

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:01.739
You're okay, Jack.

01:28:04.237 --> 01:28:05.659
I think...

01:28:06.448 --> 01:28:08.621
under different circumstances...

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:11.335
you and I...

01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:14.790
probably still would've
hated each other.

01:28:14.956 --> 01:28:16.799
[both laugh]

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:21.839
We probably could've been friends.

01:28:24.007 --> 01:28:25.680
In the next life.

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:28.645
Yeah, the next life.

01:28:34.351 --> 01:28:35.523
Yeah, great.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:38.105
Accommodations were wonderful.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:41.699
- You got a smoke?
- Don't smoke.

01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:44.577
That fed took my cigarettes.

01:28:44.778 --> 01:28:46.655
You want your cigarettes back?

01:28:46.905 --> 01:28:48.953
Then you're gonna have to go
to Flagstaff to get 'em,

01:28:49.115 --> 01:28:51.834
'cause that's where
your pal Mosely went.

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:53.836
[chuckles]

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.423
Just might do that.

01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:04.219
Where do you figure we are?

01:29:04.965 --> 01:29:07.935
My guess would be Arizona.
We've been goin' west all night.

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:09.811
I think we're almost home.

01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:14.641
I'm almost dead.

01:29:21.231 --> 01:29:22.403
Hey, look, John.

01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:24.826
You know, the Witness
Protection Program isn't so bad.

01:29:25.402 --> 01:29:27.575
They'll give you a new name.
You'll have a new life.

01:29:27.779 --> 01:29:30.328
I'm not gonna make it
to any witness protection program.

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:32.751
- You don't know that, Jon.
- I know it. You know it.

01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:36.455
Serrano's gonna get to me before I get
to any Witness Protection Program.

01:29:37.038 --> 01:29:38.255
Do me a favor.

01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:41.877
Don't pretend you care about me.
It really insults my intelligence.

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:43.215
I mean, let's face it.

01:29:43.420 --> 01:29:45.639
The only important thing
about me to you

01:29:45.839 --> 01:29:47.432
is gettin' your money.

01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:50.636
You know, I'm really tired of you
makin' me out to be some kind of thug

01:29:50.844 --> 01:29:53.063
whose only concern
is a big chunk of change.

01:29:53.346 --> 01:29:55.895
Did you know that Serrano's people
offered me $1,000,000 for you?

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:58.810
Why didn't you go for the big money?
You're doing his work for him anyway.

01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:00.229
I'm workin' for him anyway?

01:30:00.437 --> 01:30:02.030
You don't know what
the fuck you're talkin' about.

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.574
The reason I do this shit
in the first place

01:30:04.774 --> 01:30:07.072
is 'cause I wouldn't work
for that lowlife asshole.

01:30:08.069 --> 01:30:10.572
- What does that mean?
- Nothin'.

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:12.373
Doesn't mean anything.

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:20.375
Serrano is the heroin dealer
you told me about in Chicago?

01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:25.963
Who owned your buddies
and destroyed your life?

01:30:26.171 --> 01:30:27.844
That's Serrano?

01:30:29.841 --> 01:30:32.390
That's the guy
that you're takin' me in...

01:30:33.053 --> 01:30:35.306
That's the guy that's gonna kill me?

01:30:39.935 --> 01:30:42.484
Hope it's a wonderful
coffee shop, Jack.

01:31:00.246 --> 01:31:03.125
- Come on. We're gettin' off.
- What? What? What?

01:31:03.541 --> 01:31:05.669
We are getting off here,
Mr. Railroad Man.

01:31:05.877 --> 01:31:07.254
- Come on.
- What? What? No, come on!

01:31:07.462 --> 01:31:09.180
- You should be good at this.
- What are you talkin' about?

01:31:09.381 --> 01:31:11.509
Come on!
Let's discuss this!

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:24.779
- Find anything?
- Not yet.

01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:27.654
They could've jumped off the train
anywhere along the line.

01:31:36.116 --> 01:31:38.084
Trains have regularly scheduled stops.

01:31:38.284 --> 01:31:42.505
The reason for that is, y'know, because people plan
to get off the trains when they stop.

01:31:42.706 --> 01:31:44.333
And that's how,
generally, people do it.

01:31:44.541 --> 01:31:47.670
They don't, like, throw
each other off the trains.

01:31:47.877 --> 01:31:51.051
That's the purpose of having stops.

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:53.220
What's this?

01:31:53.466 --> 01:31:56.060
What are you gonna do?
What are you doin' now?

01:31:57.595 --> 01:32:00.064
What are you doin'?
What are you doin'?

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:07.359
Oh, Christ, Christ!
Come on! Come on!

01:32:07.564 --> 01:32:08.690
Are you kidding?

01:32:08.898 --> 01:32:11.697
They're gonna come out
and shoot us, for Christ's sake.

01:32:11.985 --> 01:32:13.237
What the hell?

01:32:13.987 --> 01:32:15.580
What the hell?

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.908
Jesus.
Oh, great!

01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:23.417
You get it started...

01:32:24.956 --> 01:32:28.460
and I'll run you over.
That's the best plan I can think of.

01:32:30.086 --> 01:32:31.633
[engine starts]

01:32:31.838 --> 01:32:34.466
Congratulations. Another crime.

01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.385
Come on.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:39.846
I don't like this.

01:32:40.013 --> 01:32:43.483
I don't like anything you do,
to tell you the truth. Nothin'.

01:32:54.944 --> 01:32:56.241
Where are we going?

01:32:56.446 --> 01:32:58.289
To the nearest airport.

01:33:03.036 --> 01:33:05.539
[sirens]

01:33:05.955 --> 01:33:09.084
I'm not the kind of guy that says,
"I told you so," but...

01:33:12.253 --> 01:33:14.096
Oh, shit!

01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:17.551
Looks like they've been spotted

01:33:17.759 --> 01:33:19.727
around 35 miles south
of here near Sedona.

01:33:19.928 --> 01:33:21.851
There are officers in pursuit.

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:24.144
Let's take the chopper.

01:33:35.985 --> 01:33:39.535
This is- this is- this is the kind of situation
where something bad happens.

01:33:43.368 --> 01:33:44.494
Easy!

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:49.208
Goddamn it, I don't like this!

01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:08.063
[screams]

01:34:08.268 --> 01:34:10.236
[horn honks]
Truck!

01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:52.821
- Where are you goin', Jack?
- You'll find out when we get there.

01:35:05.867 --> 01:35:07.335
I've come too far.

01:35:07.994 --> 01:35:09.462
Too far.

01:35:10.455 --> 01:35:12.298
I'm too close.

01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:41.328
[screams]

01:35:47.033 --> 01:35:48.626
[helicopter whirring]

01:36:08.471 --> 01:36:10.974
Okay. I'm coming. All right.

01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:15.604
- Come on.
- All right.

01:36:25.989 --> 01:36:27.411
Here we go.

01:36:27.991 --> 01:36:30.460
Hello! Hello!

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:36.583
Am I lucky, or am I just good?

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:38.217
Is that Marvin?

01:36:38.418 --> 01:36:39.294
[chuckles]

01:36:39.502 --> 01:36:41.095
Fuckin' A. I'm the best.

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:42.548
Marvin?

01:36:42.755 --> 01:36:45.759
Hello, Jack, you dumb shit.

01:36:54.142 --> 01:36:56.565
- Come on, you fuckin' pain in the ass!
- What was that?

01:36:56.769 --> 01:36:57.941
Wait a minute.

01:37:00.523 --> 01:37:03.117
If you move,
I'll tear your fuckin' lungs out!

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:07.288
See you in LA, Jack.

01:37:32.889 --> 01:37:35.267
Shit.

01:37:52.658 --> 01:37:54.456
Afternoon, sir.

01:37:56.329 --> 01:37:59.128
- You're open?
- Oh, we're always open.

01:38:02.085 --> 01:38:03.758
Hard day, huh?

01:38:04.295 --> 01:38:05.638
Hard week.

01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:07.882
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:10.927
I could use a cup of coffee.

01:38:11.803 --> 01:38:12.929
Yes sir.

01:38:28.152 --> 01:38:29.825
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:38:33.157 --> 01:38:34.329
Keep 'em.

01:38:48.798 --> 01:38:52.348
Gee, I been lookin'
all over for these.

01:38:53.052 --> 01:38:54.395
Thanks, Alonzo.

01:39:00.101 --> 01:39:01.899
Marvin, I have to tell you,

01:39:02.103 --> 01:39:04.982
I have this very serious
fear of flying.

01:39:04.981 --> 01:39:06.153
Yeah?

01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:08.823
Why don't you just relax
and sleep through it?

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:14.240
Forget your deadline, Walsh.
That's over.

01:39:14.407 --> 01:39:15.579
That's the way that one went.

01:39:15.825 --> 01:39:18.044
I know my rights.
You owe me phone calls.

01:39:18.244 --> 01:39:20.963
What should be of paramount importance
to you right now is not the phone call

01:39:21.164 --> 01:39:22.962
but the fact that you're
gonna spend 10 years

01:39:23.166 --> 01:39:24.509
for impersonating a federal agent.

01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:26.461
- 10 years for impersonating a fed, huh?
- 10 years.

01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:29.092
10 years. How come no one's after you?

01:39:39.056 --> 01:39:40.603
Give this guy his calls.

01:39:40.808 --> 01:39:42.185
Thanks.

01:39:43.603 --> 01:39:45.526
Can I have a little privacy, please?

01:39:55.573 --> 01:39:57.871
[phone rings]

01:39:58.159 --> 01:39:59.627
Moscone's Bail Bonds.

01:39:59.869 --> 01:40:01.371
It's Jack Walsh. Put Eddie on.

01:40:01.621 --> 01:40:02.622
It's Jack.

01:40:04.499 --> 01:40:08.254
Yeah. This better be good news, fuckin' Jack,
because you got five hours left.

01:40:08.503 --> 01:40:09.174
No, it's not, Eddie.

01:40:09.378 --> 01:40:11.676
I'm callin' to let you know that
you're a dead motherfucker.

01:40:11.881 --> 01:40:12.473
You understand me?

01:40:12.673 --> 01:40:13.970
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:40:14.175 --> 01:40:16.644
You put Marvin on this case,
you fucking piece of shit.

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:19.563
<i>You're fucking deceptive. You vermin!
You serpent!</i>

01:40:19.764 --> 01:40:23.143
- Are you fuckin' done yet?
- You slime ball in a sea of pus!

01:40:23.351 --> 01:40:25.524
- What?
- You blew it, all right?

01:40:25.728 --> 01:40:28.652
You had the guy four fuckin' days,
Jack, four days!

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:30.984
You could've fuckin'...
you could've walked him backwards

01:40:31.150 --> 01:40:33.403
and not fuckin' blown it,
but you blew it.

01:40:33.611 --> 01:40:37.616
When have I ever let you down,
you fuckin' rat?

01:40:37.865 --> 01:40:41.369
Are you fuckin' nuts,
tellin' Dorfler I offered you $100,000

01:40:41.619 --> 01:40:43.792
when I told him I'd give him $25,000?

01:40:44.747 --> 01:40:46.215
- When did you speak to him?
- What's the difference?

01:40:46.415 --> 01:40:47.507
When did you speak to Marvin?

01:40:47.708 --> 01:40:49.881
He called me fuckin', what, ten minutes ago

01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:52.388
yellin' and screamin',
tellin' me to go fuck myself.

01:40:52.588 --> 01:40:55.057
You're tellin' me, everybody's
tellin' me to go fuck myself?

01:40:55.258 --> 01:40:58.011
<i>Am I supposed to just sit
on my fuckin' butt?</i>

01:40:58.219 --> 01:40:59.971
Eddie,
what are you fucking'talkin' about?

01:41:00.221 --> 01:41:03.851
Look, you got five hours left.
Can you bring the fuckin' Duke in, yes or no?

01:41:04.016 --> 01:41:05.689
I thought he's bringin' him to you.

01:41:05.893 --> 01:41:08.692
I just talked to fuckin' Dorfler.
He don't have the Duke.

01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:10.819
- What?
- Where's the fuckin' Duke?

01:41:12.108 --> 01:41:13.826
- Hello?
- I'll talk to you later.

01:41:13.985 --> 01:41:15.828
Jack!

01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:51.606
- Hello?
- Yeah, Tony Darvo there, please?

01:41:51.814 --> 01:41:53.987
- Who's calling?
- Marvin Dorfler.

01:41:58.112 --> 01:41:59.204
Yo.

01:41:59.405 --> 01:42:01.328
<i>[Man]: I got Marvin Dorfler on the line.
Shall I put him through?</i>

01:42:01.532 --> 01:42:03.125
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Put him through.

01:42:03.784 --> 01:42:05.286
Marvin.

01:42:05.494 --> 01:42:06.871
Everything still on schedule,
pal, isn't it?

01:42:07.038 --> 01:42:09.040
So Dorfler's workin' for you guys.

01:42:09.248 --> 01:42:11.216
- Who is this?
- This is Jack Walsh.

01:42:11.417 --> 01:42:15.172
Jack, what are you complainin' for?
We came to you first, didn't we?

01:42:15.421 --> 01:42:18.595
It's Jack Walsh.
Hold on. Somebody wants to say hello.

01:42:20.217 --> 01:42:22.595
Hey.
Too late for you, scumbag.

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:24.055
No, no, no, too late for you.

01:42:24.263 --> 01:42:25.810
I didn't come this far
not to collect my money.

01:42:25.973 --> 01:42:28.772
You understand me, you motherfuckers?
I want the Duke back.

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:30.228
So what the fuck
are you tellin' me for?

01:42:30.436 --> 01:42:33.189
What am I tellin' you for?
What am I tellin' you for?

01:42:33.481 --> 01:42:35.279
I'll tell you what
I'm tellin' you for.

01:42:35.524 --> 01:42:37.743
I got some of the Duke's belongings.
That's why.

01:42:37.985 --> 01:42:40.659
Including some computer disks
that have every last detail

01:42:40.905 --> 01:42:44.830
of Serrano's businesses
and his money-laundering operations. Everything.

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:47.711
<i>And if I don't get the Duke back
in the next two hours</i>

01:42:47.912 --> 01:42:50.916
I'm gonna turn those disks over
to the feds. You hear me?

01:42:51.123 --> 01:42:53.296
<i>You tell Serrano
I want to meet him with the Duke</i>

01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:55.424
<i>alone in two hours in the main
terminal of McCarran Airport</i>

01:42:55.628 --> 01:42:56.880
where we'll make the exchange.

01:42:57.046 --> 01:42:58.548
I know he's the only one
of you fucking idiots

01:42:58.756 --> 01:42:59.928
who won't try to take a shot at me
in a public place,

01:43:00.132 --> 01:43:03.261
and if I see one fuckin' single goon
within a mile of that airport...

01:43:03.636 --> 01:43:05.183
<i>Now listen to me very carefully...</i>

01:43:05.388 --> 01:43:07.311
...the deal is off,
and I'm going to the feds.

01:43:07.515 --> 01:43:09.609
I ain't gonna bother Jimmy
with your bullshit.

01:43:09.809 --> 01:43:12.437
You're not? Okay, fine. Fine.
After he's busted

01:43:12.645 --> 01:43:15.023
I'll make sure to let him know
you knew all about it beforehand.

01:43:15.439 --> 01:43:18.739
<i>That's two hours from now.
Main terminal, McCarran Airport.</i>

01:43:18.984 --> 01:43:21.328
You got that, moron? Have a nice day.

01:43:28.119 --> 01:43:29.996
Tell Alonzo I want to make a deal.

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:46.307
You want to make a deal with me?

01:43:46.512 --> 01:43:48.640
What would you do
if I could deliver you Serrano?

01:43:50.975 --> 01:43:52.147
What do you mean, "deliver"?

01:43:52.351 --> 01:43:55.025
For starters, conspiracy to destroy
government evidence.

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:56.606
What government evidence?

01:43:56.772 --> 01:43:59.491
Will you let me take the Duke back
myself and collect my money?

01:44:09.243 --> 01:44:10.165
Tell me more.

01:44:10.369 --> 01:44:11.461
I'll have to tell you on the way

01:44:11.662 --> 01:44:13.130
'cause we gotta be
in Las Vegas in two hours.

01:44:30.765 --> 01:44:32.062
[JON] : Marvin?

01:44:33.392 --> 01:44:36.066
- Marvin?
- No, it's room service.

01:44:47.072 --> 01:44:48.540
Here. Hold this up...

01:44:49.158 --> 01:44:51.206
so they know I took this today.

01:44:52.244 --> 01:44:54.838
I amaze myself. I'm always thinking.

01:44:56.415 --> 01:44:58.042
Got it all figured out.

01:44:58.584 --> 01:45:01.508
- Now say, "Cheese."
- Don't do this, Marvin.

01:45:04.381 --> 01:45:05.803
<i>Adios.</i>

01:45:09.011 --> 01:45:11.013
All right.
There are no real computer disks.

01:45:11.263 --> 01:45:12.890
- Is that right?
- Right.

01:45:13.098 --> 01:45:14.645
So if you give him blank disks...

01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:18.070
and he accepts them would that
still be considered an overt act?

01:45:18.270 --> 01:45:19.943
If he just sets foot
inside the airport

01:45:20.147 --> 01:45:23.151
he's committed an overt act,
conspiracy to obstruct justice.

01:45:23.359 --> 01:45:25.657
When he shows up with the Duke,
you add kidnapping.

01:45:25.903 --> 01:45:28.076
Anybody packing a gun,
conspiracy to commit murder.

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:29.702
The fact that it's an airport,

01:45:29.907 --> 01:45:31.409
and Alonzo, correct me
if you think I'm wrong here.

01:45:31.617 --> 01:45:32.709
I don't want to
step on your toes.

01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:34.537
You can slap an interstate
transportation aid

01:45:34.745 --> 01:45:36.497
or racketeering rap
on him right away as well.

01:45:37.957 --> 01:45:39.584
Yeah, well none of that
bullshit means anything

01:45:39.792 --> 01:45:41.715
unless you can get him
to take those disks from you.

01:45:41.877 --> 01:45:44.596
Don't worry.
I'll get him to take the disks.

01:45:44.797 --> 01:45:46.470
Get a wire on this man.

01:45:56.767 --> 01:45:58.565
Marvin.

01:46:00.604 --> 01:46:04.074
No hard feelings about
what happened back in Amarillo, huh?

01:46:08.112 --> 01:46:11.491
Just one of those
spur-of-the-moment deals, you know?

01:46:11.866 --> 01:46:14.335
- Where is he?
- Where's the money?

01:46:14.827 --> 01:46:16.374
In the car. Where is he?

01:46:19.665 --> 01:46:23.135
Slight change of plans.
Now I want $2 million.

01:46:23.335 --> 01:46:24.006
What?

01:46:24.211 --> 01:46:25.758
I read the newspapers, you know?

01:46:25.963 --> 01:46:27.931
The guy got you
for $15 million, right?

01:46:28.090 --> 01:46:30.684
So I figure he's gotta be worth
at least $2 million.

01:46:31.969 --> 01:46:33.642
I'm a businessman.

01:46:35.264 --> 01:46:37.141
How do we know you got him?

01:46:44.899 --> 01:46:46.526
I want $1 million now...

01:46:47.192 --> 01:46:49.069
and I'll call you in 20 minutes,

01:46:49.278 --> 01:46:51.997
tell you where to drop off
the second million.

01:46:52.197 --> 01:46:55.246
Once I know it's there,
then I'll tell you where he is.

01:46:56.452 --> 01:46:58.204
Okay?

01:46:59.038 --> 01:47:01.166
- Not okay.
- Why not?

01:47:06.670 --> 01:47:08.513
What are you, fucking nuts?
What's Jimmy gonna say?

01:47:08.672 --> 01:47:10.174
How the fuck we gonna get the Duke now?

01:47:10.424 --> 01:47:11.676
You got the answer
right in your hand!

01:47:11.884 --> 01:47:13.261
What are you talkin' about?

01:47:14.178 --> 01:47:16.476
Joey, when are you gonna learn
how to pay attention?

01:47:16.972 --> 01:47:19.395
Look. See what it says there?

01:47:24.313 --> 01:47:25.439
All right. This is it.

01:47:25.648 --> 01:47:28.151
Tonight is the fucking night.
You understand?

01:47:28.359 --> 01:47:30.157
I'm sick of all of these screw-ups.

01:47:30.319 --> 01:47:32.617
As soon as I get the disks from Walsh,

01:47:32.905 --> 01:47:36.125
you guys drop Walsh
and you drop the Duke. Do you understand?

01:47:36.325 --> 01:47:39.124
I get the disks, you drop them. Okay?

01:47:39.745 --> 01:47:42.168
- I don't think you should do this.
- Oh, really?

01:47:42.498 --> 01:47:44.091
What do you propose that I do?

01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:46.714
Send somebody with a cash offer,
but don't do this.

01:47:46.961 --> 01:47:49.055
I know Walsh.
He won't take any money from me.

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:50.923
He's a very self-righteous
type of guy.

01:47:51.090 --> 01:47:52.307
It aggravates me.

01:47:52.508 --> 01:47:53.680
In his mind, this is clean.

01:47:53.884 --> 01:47:55.807
He gets what he wants,
I get what I want.

01:47:55.970 --> 01:47:58.223
- The guy's a fuckin' burnout, Sidney.
- Hey, Jimmy...

01:47:58.430 --> 01:48:02.526
Sidney, sit down, relax, have a sandwich,
drink a glass of milk. Do some fuckin' thing, will 'ya.

01:48:20.619 --> 01:48:21.916
He's on his way.

01:48:36.135 --> 01:48:38.012
<i>[Agent]: He's heading north
on Las Vegas Boulevard,</i>

01:48:38.262 --> 01:48:41.266
<i>approximately two miles
from the airport. We're right on him.</i>

01:48:41.473 --> 01:48:42.941
Why are you smiling?

01:48:43.976 --> 01:48:45.819
I feel like a cop again.

01:49:38.781 --> 01:49:41.500
So I'm finally in the
presence of greatness, huh?

01:49:42.201 --> 01:49:43.373
The Duke.

01:49:44.661 --> 01:49:46.709
The guy that steals money
from the scum of the earth

01:49:46.914 --> 01:49:49.542
and gives it to the unfortunates
of the world.

01:49:49.750 --> 01:49:51.798
I wanted to meet you face to face.

01:49:57.925 --> 01:50:00.974
Did you actually think that
you were gonna steal my money

01:50:01.178 --> 01:50:02.930
and get away with it?

01:50:04.890 --> 01:50:07.359
I stopped by here
to tell you two things:

01:50:08.227 --> 01:50:10.696
Number one is that
you're gonna die tonight.

01:50:11.563 --> 01:50:16.364
Number two: I'm gonna go home,
have a nice hot meal...

01:50:17.694 --> 01:50:21.540
...I'm gonna find your wife,
and I'm gonna kill her, too.

01:50:30.749 --> 01:50:33.127
Joey, wait here for my call.
The rest of you start going in.

01:50:33.335 --> 01:50:34.587
You got it.

01:50:51.395 --> 01:50:52.738
Here he comes.

01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:06.164
Jack. Long time no see.

01:51:06.618 --> 01:51:07.961
Long time no see.

01:51:08.245 --> 01:51:10.668
I see you're still spendin'
all your money on clothes.

01:51:10.873 --> 01:51:13.843
- You know...
- Listen, while you're in town

01:51:14.001 --> 01:51:17.221
<i>if you want to go see a show
or you want a free meal or something</i>

01:51:17.462 --> 01:51:19.260
<i>like that you just
let me know, all right? On me.</i>

01:51:19.506 --> 01:51:20.849
That's the type of guy I am.

01:51:21.008 --> 01:51:22.510
You're a real sport.

01:51:22.843 --> 01:51:24.766
Just give him the disks.

01:51:25.179 --> 01:51:26.681
How's your mother?

01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:29.687
She's all right.

01:51:29.933 --> 01:51:31.935
Daughter's gettin' big, growing up.

01:51:36.899 --> 01:51:40.369
You know, I was thinkin' maybe if we would've
clone business way back when,

01:51:40.569 --> 01:51:43.664
you wouldn't look like a guy
with a fucking cup in your hand.

01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:46.583
- I'm tryin' to make a living.
- Yeah.

01:51:46.867 --> 01:51:48.494
Listen, Jack, you got those disks

01:51:48.702 --> 01:51:51.296
or did you lose them
like you lost your job?

01:51:54.958 --> 01:51:56.801
Give him the disks, Walsh.

01:51:58.045 --> 01:52:00.093
I see you, but I don't see the Duke.

01:52:00.339 --> 01:52:04.014
- We'll worry about him in a minute.
- We gotta worry about him now.

01:52:06.178 --> 01:52:09.307
Let me tell you somethin', Jimmy.
This isn't a reunion.

01:52:09.681 --> 01:52:13.686
If I don't see the Duke
in about five seconds, I'm walking.

01:52:14.770 --> 01:52:17.114
You know,
you're still way too serious.

01:52:17.314 --> 01:52:20.284
Really. Listen.
Why don't you just hand over the tapes,

01:52:20.484 --> 01:52:21.906
we'll take a walk,
we'll go get the guy together.

01:52:22.069 --> 01:52:24.071
Fuck you.
I'll see you at the arraignment.

01:52:24.279 --> 01:52:26.077
Hey, Jack, Jack. Hey.

01:52:26.365 --> 01:52:27.958
Where the hell is he goin'?

01:52:28.158 --> 01:52:29.375
You win, all right?

01:52:29.576 --> 01:52:30.327
- I what?
- You won.

01:52:30.535 --> 01:52:33.129
What do you want me to do,
yell it all over this fucking airport?

01:52:34.957 --> 01:52:36.174
Where is he?

01:52:40.087 --> 01:52:42.840
- He's on his way.
- You know I said no goons.

01:52:43.006 --> 01:52:45.225
Never mind him.
You're gonna get what you want.

01:52:45.425 --> 01:52:46.677
Didn't I just tell you that?

01:52:46.885 --> 01:52:49.058
This thing is gonna give me
a heart attack before it's all over.

01:52:49.263 --> 01:52:51.061
I know I'm gonna
get a heart attack.

01:53:03.235 --> 01:53:05.283
Since we have this moment
to share together

01:53:05.487 --> 01:53:07.239
there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

01:53:10.742 --> 01:53:15.373
Doesn't it bother you that another
copper is fuckin' your wife?

01:53:17.833 --> 01:53:20.256
Do you know
they made this guy a captain?

01:53:21.503 --> 01:53:25.098
Can you imagine that?
Go figure it out. Made him a captain.

01:53:33.056 --> 01:53:36.105
- Can I help you, sir?
- Give me a one- way ticket to LA.

01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:38.233
One-way ticket to Los Angeles.

01:53:39.938 --> 01:53:42.111
Will that be smoking or non-smoking?

01:53:42.399 --> 01:53:44.026
Take a wild guess.

01:53:44.985 --> 01:53:46.862
Smoking.

01:53:57.205 --> 01:53:59.833
And how will you
be paying for this, sir?

01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:09.597
- Oh shit.
- What?

01:54:09.801 --> 01:54:11.098
Look.

01:54:17.559 --> 01:54:19.106
What the hell is he doing here?

01:54:19.311 --> 01:54:21.689
Alright, we have a male Caucasian
carrying a green duffel bag

01:54:21.897 --> 01:54:24.320
with his hands inside his vest
approaching the subjects.

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:27.368
Get him out of there as quickly
and as quietly as possible.

01:54:27.569 --> 01:54:30.493
Shoot him if you have to,
but get him out of here.

01:54:32.366 --> 01:54:33.618
- You okay, Jon?
- Yeah.

01:54:33.909 --> 01:54:36.503
- Stand behind me.
- It's all right.

01:54:37.954 --> 01:54:39.456
Alright, come on.

01:54:41.666 --> 01:54:43.885
- Hey, how's everybody doin'?
- Get out of here, Marvin.

01:54:44.044 --> 01:54:45.512
Back off, everybody. Back off.

01:54:45.712 --> 01:54:48.261
- Who the fuck are you?
- What, are you writin' a book? Who the fuck are you?

01:54:48.465 --> 01:54:49.762
Who is this guy?

01:54:49.966 --> 01:54:51.218
Jesus.

01:54:51.426 --> 01:54:52.894
Marvin, Marvin. You're missin'
the bigger picture here.

01:54:53.053 --> 01:54:54.305
I'm telling you, get out of here.

01:54:54.721 --> 01:54:56.143
Wire's gone dead.

01:54:56.348 --> 01:54:57.395
Are you crazy?

01:54:57.641 --> 01:54:59.814
I didn't come all
this way for nothin'.

01:55:01.686 --> 01:55:03.233
- Serrano's leaving.
- Did he take the disks?

01:55:03.480 --> 01:55:04.857
I don't know.

01:55:05.357 --> 01:55:07.234
- Serrano's got the disks.
- Let him go, Jack.

01:55:07.442 --> 01:55:09.536
Serrano's got the disks.

01:55:09.736 --> 01:55:11.079
Did he or did he not take the disks?

01:55:11.279 --> 01:55:13.247
I couldn't tell.
There's too much goin' on down there.

01:55:15.659 --> 01:55:18.287
Serrano's got the disks.
He's got the disks.

01:55:20.664 --> 01:55:22.337
Marvin! Marvin, Marvin, look out!

01:55:22.541 --> 01:55:23.918
Marvin, Marvin, Marvin, look out!

01:55:24.126 --> 01:55:26.220
If you think I'm fallin' for
that shit again you're crazy.

01:55:26.503 --> 01:55:29.848
Marvin! Marvin, look out!
You stupid fuck, will you look out!

01:55:30.132 --> 01:55:32.760
Serrano's got the disks!
Serrano's got the disks!

01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:34.887
Move in.

01:55:35.053 --> 01:55:36.896
[all shouting]

01:55:43.395 --> 01:55:45.568
Take it easy! Come on!

01:55:46.565 --> 01:55:49.535
Ow! Goddamn it!
Who the fuck are you guys?

01:55:54.072 --> 01:55:58.248
Jimmy, there's somethin' I've been
wanting to say to you for ten years.

01:55:58.452 --> 01:56:00.830
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
- You're under arrest.

01:56:02.038 --> 01:56:03.915
We'll catch up with each other
one of these days.

01:56:04.124 --> 01:56:05.922
Maybe we will.

01:56:07.335 --> 01:56:09.588
- We still got our deal?
- We got our deal.

01:56:09.796 --> 01:56:13.300
Hey, wait a minute! What deal?
Why the fuck does he get special treatment?

01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:14.972
See you in LA, Marvin.

01:56:15.177 --> 01:56:17.646
Watch your cigarettes
with this guy, Jack.

01:56:18.763 --> 01:56:20.140
<i>What's gain' on?</i>

01:56:20.348 --> 01:56:23.192
Sorry, Jon. I got an hour and a half
to get you back to LA.

01:56:23.393 --> 01:56:24.645
Thanks, Alonzo.

01:58:06.746 --> 01:58:08.464
[phone rings]

01:58:08.665 --> 01:58:10.133
Yeah, Moscone's Bail Bonds.

01:58:10.584 --> 01:58:12.757
- Hello, Eddie. Where's Jerry?
- Yeah?

01:58:12.961 --> 01:58:15.089
Never mind Jerry.
Where the hell are you, Jack?

01:58:15.297 --> 01:58:17.174
Feds picked him up 20 minutes ago.

01:58:17.424 --> 01:58:19.347
- Yeah, what for?
- What's the difference, man?

01:58:19.551 --> 01:58:21.303
I never trusted that guy anyway.

01:58:21.511 --> 01:58:24.560
- Where the hell are you?
- Where am I? I'm at the airport.

01:58:24.764 --> 01:58:26.892
And guess who I'm with?
I'm with the Duke.

01:58:27.058 --> 01:58:30.858
You got him! You got him, Jack!
I love you!

01:58:31.021 --> 01:58:33.740
- You want to say hello?
- Yeah. Put him on.

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:35.408
- Say hello.
- Hello.

01:58:35.609 --> 01:58:37.657
Hello, you son of a bitch!

01:58:38.069 --> 01:58:38.945
<i>We got you.</i>

01:58:39.112 --> 01:58:40.705
<i>you son of a bitch!</i>

01:58:40.947 --> 01:58:42.824
Now say goodbye,
you lying little piece of shit,

01:58:43.033 --> 01:58:44.410
because I'm letting him go.

01:58:44.618 --> 01:58:46.370
Jack?

01:58:52.417 --> 01:58:54.465
Would've been a nice coffee shop.

01:58:56.463 --> 01:59:00.058
Oh, Jesus. Oh.

01:59:02.010 --> 01:59:03.262
I don't get it.

01:59:04.304 --> 01:59:05.851
I did what I wanted to do, Jon.

01:59:06.056 --> 01:59:08.024
I got you to LA
before midnight, so...

01:59:16.441 --> 01:59:18.068
I don't know what to say.

01:59:18.735 --> 01:59:19.952
Don't say anything.

01:59:20.111 --> 01:59:23.160
Knowing you, you'll make me want
to put those back on you again.

01:59:24.532 --> 01:59:25.749
Thanks.

01:59:25.950 --> 01:59:28.453
- No, Jon, thank you.
- Thank you.

01:59:34.751 --> 01:59:37.129
Somethin' to remember
our adventure by.

01:59:41.049 --> 01:59:42.642
Jack.

01:59:51.184 --> 01:59:52.606
This better be good.

01:59:54.521 --> 01:59:55.864
This is good.

01:59:57.273 --> 01:59:59.116
This is very good.

02:00:03.988 --> 02:00:05.331
When I was makin' my getaway,

02:00:05.532 --> 02:00:07.500
I thought the FBI
was closin' in on me.

02:00:07.701 --> 02:00:10.830
Take it, take it.
I took some traveling money.

02:00:10.995 --> 02:00:12.542
Take it, take it.

02:00:14.541 --> 02:00:18.717
It's not a payoff. It's a gift.
You already let me go.

02:00:21.047 --> 02:00:22.720
You son of a bitch.

02:00:23.758 --> 02:00:26.477
- You son of a bitch.
- Told you I had money.

02:00:26.678 --> 02:00:29.773
I know you had money,
but I didn't know you had money.

02:00:38.898 --> 02:00:40.195
How much is here?

02:00:40.734 --> 02:00:42.486
Neighborhood of $300,000.

02:00:44.529 --> 02:00:49.035
That's a... that's a very
respectable neighborhood.

02:00:54.581 --> 02:00:56.424
I don't know what to say, Jon.

02:00:58.126 --> 02:00:59.799
Take care.

02:01:01.921 --> 02:01:04.720
- Take care.
- See you in the next life.

02:01:05.467 --> 02:01:08.346
- See you in the next life.
- See you in the next life.

02:01:34.871 --> 02:01:37.294
- Do you know what time it is?
- 25 to 12:00.

02:01:37.665 --> 02:01:39.417
25 t012:00.

02:01:40.627 --> 02:01:42.425
I would've made it.

02:01:55.058 --> 02:01:57.356
You wouldn't have change for $1,000,
would you?

02:01:57.602 --> 02:02:00.981
[Driver]: What are you, a comedian?
Get out of here, you bum!

02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:10.953
Looks like I'm walkin'.
