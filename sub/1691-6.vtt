Okay. I... I was just gonna hit the...

04:34.513 --> 04:37.147

04:37.182 --> 04:38.982
[Chuckles] Yeah.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.184
Mm. Different, anyway.

04:41.186 --> 04:44.404
Yeah. [Sniffs]

04:44.439 --> 04:45.772
How you doing?

04:45.824 --> 04:50.193
I'm... yeah, I'm okay, you know?

04:50.195 --> 04:53.413
Adjusting.

04:53.448 --> 04:55.031
And Kaylee?

04:55.033 --> 04:59.452
Yeah, she's settling in.

04:59.504 --> 05:02.288
She still asks about him...

05:02.340 --> 05:05.125
"Where is daddy?"

05:05.177 --> 05:06.876
She just misses him.

05:06.878 --> 05:10.380
Yeah.

05:12.184 --> 05:14.350
How long you in town for, Mike?

05:14.386 --> 05:16.770
I'm here...

05:16.805 --> 05:18.605
For the duration, indefinitely.

05:18.640 --> 05:23.026
I'm, uh... I'm better.

05:23.061 --> 05:25.145
And I'm sorry it took me so long.

05:25.197 --> 05:29.449
But I'm not like I was.
I'm back. I'm solid.

05:29.484 --> 05:34.988
I want to be here for you,
for Kaylee, for my family.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.208
That's good.
I'm glad to hear you're better.

[Sighs]

05:40.879 --> 05:42.712
What?

05:42.747 --> 05:45.715
What is it, honey?

05:45.750 --> 05:47.300
Mike, I got to ask...

05:47.335 --> 05:52.505
I mean... I know I just
need to move on from this,

05:52.557 --> 05:56.142
but I keep thinking about something.

05:56.178 --> 05:57.343
About what?

05:57.395 --> 05:59.179
How, before Matty died,

05:59.231 --> 06:04.601
like, for a few weeks there,
he was... Different.

06:04.603 --> 06:07.604
Different how?

06:07.606 --> 06:09.823
Different... I don't know.

06:09.858 --> 06:11.508
Moody, you know?

06:11.543 --> 06:15.328
He barely ate. H... He wasn't sleeping.

06:15.363 --> 06:18.331
He snapped at me
about the stupidest things.

06:18.366 --> 06:20.750
I started to think something's up at work

06:20.785 --> 06:22.752
or... or someone's sick,
something like that,

06:22.787 --> 06:25.788
but he wouldn't talk to me.
He clammed right up.

06:25.790 --> 06:29.876
Cops aren't real touchy-feely.
You know that.

06:29.928 --> 06:32.295
No.

06:32.297 --> 06:34.297
[Scoffs] They're not. No.

06:34.299 --> 06:38.718
But this wasn't the normal
"tough guys don't cry" crap.

06:38.770 --> 06:39.936
This was more.

06:39.971 --> 06:42.772
I mean... Did you notice?

06:42.807 --> 06:44.190
I mean, did you feel

06:44.226 --> 06:46.192
anything like that from him?

06:46.228 --> 06:49.195
I don't... as far as I remember,
he seemed okay.

06:49.231 --> 06:51.114
He seemed okay to me.

06:51.149 --> 06:54.734
Well, I started to think... I'm...

06:54.786 --> 06:57.737
I don't know. I didn't know what to think.

06:57.789 --> 07:00.156
But then... Three days

07:00.158 --> 07:01.991
or... or four... I don't remember...

07:01.993 --> 07:04.711
But before he died,
there was this phone call.

07:04.746 --> 07:08.464
2:30 in the morning, I wake up,
and Matty's not in bed.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.884
And I hear him. He's talking downstairs.

07:10.919 --> 07:14.087
So... I go to listen on the stairs,

07:14.139 --> 07:16.723
where he couldn't see.

07:16.758 --> 07:19.259
He gets intense.

07:19.311 --> 07:20.977
Like, he'd be screaming

07:21.012 --> 07:23.596
if he wasn't whispering, you know?

07:23.648 --> 07:26.432
Matty didn't get worked up.
He'd let things go.

07:26.484 --> 07:30.069
But... but this... I mean, he was angry.

07:30.105 --> 07:32.906
He was really angry.

07:32.941 --> 07:35.158
What was he saying?

07:35.193 --> 07:39.362
I couldn't make it out.
It was something about...

07:39.364 --> 07:41.364
I don't know. I couldn't hear it.

07:41.366 --> 07:43.199
[Sighs]

07:43.201 --> 07:45.034
But the next morning, I called him out...

07:45.036 --> 07:47.670
"What the hell was that about?
What's going on?"

07:47.706 --> 07:50.623
And he wouldn't talk to me.

07:50.675 --> 07:54.043
But I think...

07:54.045 --> 07:56.629
I think he was talking to you.

07:56.681 --> 07:59.048
Me?

07:59.050 --> 08:01.684
I mean, who else?

08:01.720 --> 08:02.852
Huh?

08:02.887 --> 08:05.471
For one hot second,

08:05.523 --> 08:07.307
I thought maybe he was catting around...

08:07.359 --> 08:08.808
No, he wouldn't do that.

08:08.860 --> 08:11.194
No, I know. I know that. But you...

08:11.660 --> 08:14.028
He knew he could call you
anytime he had a problem.

08:14.064 --> 08:16.031
You were thick as thieves, the two of you.

08:16.066 --> 08:18.033
And there was something in his voice.

08:18.068 --> 08:21.653
It was... How he was talking.

08:21.705 --> 08:24.039
It makes me think it was you.

08:24.074 --> 08:26.658
Stace, I don't think it was.

08:26.710 --> 08:29.878
I can't recall any late-night
heart-to-hearts with him,

08:29.913 --> 08:31.546
not around then.

08:31.582 --> 08:35.500
Maybe it was a C.I. or a case.

08:35.552 --> 08:37.719
Listen.

08:37.754 --> 08:40.922
I know what you're doing...
replaying it over and over,

08:40.924 --> 08:43.140
thinking, "if I'd noticed this
or changed that",

08:43.177 --> 08:45.760
maybe I could have done something."

08:45.762 --> 08:48.980
You don't think I haven't had
those thoughts? I do.

08:49.016 --> 08:50.432
[Scoffs]

08:50.434 --> 08:53.268
Every day.

08:53.270 --> 08:56.538
You got to quit beating
yourself up like this.

08:59.209 --> 09:02.010
Matty's gone. [Sighs]

09:02.045 --> 09:05.046
That's really all there is to it.

09:10.220 --> 09:12.220
Yeah.

09:14.124 --> 09:16.558
I guess that's that.

09:20.797 --> 09:22.631
It's getting on.

09:22.633 --> 09:28.270
I got to... Get Kaylee her dinner
and put her to bed.

09:28.305 --> 09:29.971
Uh, yeah.

09:32.309 --> 09:35.727
Okay.

09:35.779 --> 09:37.562
Well, if you want me to drop by

09:37.614 --> 09:40.565
and keep an eye on her, I...

09:40.617 --> 09:42.234
I want to help.

09:44.288 --> 09:46.905
[Breathes deeply]

10:30.667 --> 10:33.034
"Francisco."

10:33.036 --> 10:34.252
Yeah.

10:34.288 --> 10:35.670
You know this town?

10:35.706 --> 10:37.088
Yeah, sure.

10:37.124 --> 10:38.540
How well?

10:41.044 --> 10:44.262
- [Dogs barking, whining]
- Caldera: You sew this up yourself?

10:44.298 --> 10:46.798
Not bad.

10:46.850 --> 10:48.433
Bet there's a story there.

10:48.468 --> 10:51.436
- Isn't there always?
- Yeah.

10:51.471 --> 10:54.639
All right. Little sting here.

10:54.691 --> 10:58.026
Okay. That ought to do it.

10:58.061 --> 10:59.444
Now...

10:59.479 --> 11:00.812
[Scissors thud]

11:00.864 --> 11:02.814
You're gonna want to take it easy.

11:02.866 --> 11:04.816
Keep it clean.

11:04.868 --> 11:07.452
Keep it dry. Let it heal.

11:07.487 --> 11:10.572
There's a Walgreens a couple
blocks over on Louisiana.

11:10.574 --> 11:12.407
Maybe go get yourself a sling.

11:12.409 --> 11:14.042
You don't have one?

11:14.077 --> 11:15.877
[Scoffs] [Chuckling] Sorry.

11:15.912 --> 11:17.462
Got a cone you can put around your neck.

11:17.497 --> 11:18.496
Yeah.

11:18.548 --> 11:21.916
It's about the same, right?

11:21.918 --> 11:24.336
So, it's gonna be $500?

11:24.388 --> 11:25.754
$500.

11:25.756 --> 11:29.758
I can, uh, throw some pills in
for the pain.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.426
[Pills rattling]

11:31.428 --> 11:33.061
This stuff's essentially Vicodin.

11:33.096 --> 11:35.063
I can give it to you for $25 a pill...

11:35.098 --> 11:37.482
maybe drop the price to $15

11:37.517 --> 11:39.985
for something a little less human-centric.

11:40.020 --> 11:43.188
I'm an aspirin man. [Sighs]

11:43.240 --> 11:47.025
Tell you what...
take a couple on the house.

11:47.077 --> 11:49.277
In case you change your mind.

11:51.581 --> 11:52.947
You new in town?

11:52.949 --> 11:55.583
Yeah.

11:55.619 --> 11:57.686
Passing through or sticking around?

11:57.721 --> 11:59.888
Why?

11:59.923 --> 12:01.623
No reason.

12:01.625 --> 12:06.628
It's just, if you're relocating
to the land of enchantment,

12:06.630 --> 12:09.464
I know people.

12:09.466 --> 12:11.049
I could get you some work.

12:11.101 --> 12:14.469
I am not looking for that kind of work,

12:14.471 --> 12:19.474
but... ohh... thanks.

12:22.729 --> 12:25.313
Don't know why it has to be this way.

12:25.315 --> 12:28.533
Could have been friendly.
Could have talked in your house.

12:28.568 --> 12:30.952
You really want the formal treatment?

12:30.987 --> 12:32.370
Lawyer.

12:32.406 --> 12:34.572
Come on, Mike.

12:34.624 --> 12:36.207
It's just a couple of questions.

12:36.243 --> 12:39.044
Uh, ain't nothing but a thing.

12:39.079 --> 12:40.662
Lawyer.

12:40.664 --> 12:42.747
You're not under arrest.

12:42.799 --> 12:44.382
Okay, did anybody here say "arrest"? No.

12:44.418 --> 12:46.084
You want to walk, walk.

12:46.136 --> 12:47.919
I got to say, I, uh, expected

12:47.971 --> 12:51.172
more cooperation
from you on this, cop to cop.

12:51.174 --> 12:54.642
Lawyer.

12:57.481 --> 13:00.482
[Sighs]

13:02.269 --> 13:05.687
Fine. What lawyer?

13:14.568 --> 13:16.952
Ehrmantraut... Who's got him and where?

13:16.987 --> 13:19.755
That way.

13:19.790 --> 13:21.757
Hey, fellas. How you doing?

13:21.890 --> 13:25.692
James McGill... here to see my client.

13:25.728 --> 13:27.444
What?

13:27.479 --> 13:30.147
- You look like Matlock.
- Uh, no,

13:30.199 --> 13:33.367
I look like a young Paul Newman
dressed as Matlock.

13:33.402 --> 13:34.952
Where's my guy?

13:34.987 --> 13:36.820
[Beep]

13:36.872 --> 13:40.040
[Sighs] Say hello to Barney fife.

13:40.075 --> 13:44.044
Wrong show, but thanks for playing.

13:44.079 --> 13:46.246
[Sighs]

13:46.248 --> 13:47.631
So, what happened...

13:47.666 --> 13:50.500
the mayor didn't give you enough stickers?

13:52.388 --> 13:54.972
You want to tell me what we're doing here?

13:55.007 --> 13:56.974
Oh, here's your coffee.

13:57.009 --> 13:59.810
Uh, hope it's good to the last drop,

13:59.845 --> 14:02.012
'cause I'm billing you
the full hour for it.

14:02.064 --> 14:03.430
That's for you.

14:03.432 --> 14:06.066
Oh. That's very thoughtful.

14:06.101 --> 14:07.484
[Sighs]

14:07.519 --> 14:09.903
You serious?

14:10.018 --> 14:11.221
Why did you have me bring it to you?

14:11.316 --> 14:12.556
Mike: All right, here's
what's gonna happen.

14:12.615 --> 14:15.776
Those two cops out there
are from Philadelphia.

14:15.815 --> 14:17.577
They've come a long way to see me.

14:17.613 --> 14:19.997
When they come in here,
we're all gonna have a little chat.

14:20.032 --> 14:20.915
And when it's over,

14:20.931 --> 14:23.667
the young one, who's been
writing in his little notebook,

14:23.702 --> 14:25.669
he's gonna take it
and put it in his jacket.

14:25.704 --> 14:27.287
And when he does that,

14:27.289 --> 14:30.957
I want you to take that coffee
and spill it on him...

14:30.959 --> 14:33.377
little accident, that's all.

14:33.429 --> 14:36.347
- And why, pray tell, would I do that?
- Because I'm asking you to.

14:36.428 --> 14:38.666
- It's the only reason you're here.
- [Sighs]

14:38.681 --> 14:40.898
So I'm here because you want me
to assault a police officer.

14:40.933 --> 14:44.902
I am asking you to take
a few ounces of lukewarm coffee

14:44.937 --> 14:46.353
and spill it on him.

14:46.355 --> 14:49.773
I doubt that satisfies
the definition of "assault,"

14:49.825 --> 14:53.193
but, hey, you're the lawyer.

14:53.195 --> 14:55.195
Right. How silly of me.

14:55.197 --> 14:57.031
All you want is for me to aid and abet

14:57.033 --> 14:58.749
you ripping off that guy's notepad,

14:58.784 --> 15:00.834
'cause that's what
you're doing here, right?

15:00.870 --> 15:02.836
Huh? What... are you nuts?

15:02.872 --> 15:04.371
You can't be serious.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.989
Hey, I hate to remind you
of this, but you owe me one.

15:08.025 --> 15:10.608
The assist I gave you with
the missing-persons problem...

15:10.610 --> 15:12.243
one good turn and so forth?

15:12.279 --> 15:14.863
You want a good turn?
Here's your good turn, okay?

15:14.915 --> 15:16.581
I'm gonna behave

15:16.616 --> 15:20.001
like an honest-to-God,
law-abiding, licensed attorney,

15:20.037 --> 15:21.920
'cause, clearly, you need one

15:21.955 --> 15:23.421
with whatever the hell is going on here.

15:23.457 --> 15:25.173
Now, those two jokers out in the hallway...

15:25.208 --> 15:27.542
I'm gonna make sure they dot
their I's and cross their t's...

15:27.594 --> 15:29.961
everything square and above board.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.379
That's what I'm gonna do,

15:31.431 --> 15:34.015
and you're gonna be
happy as hell that I'm here.

15:34.051 --> 15:38.269
But this little Juan Valdez
bump-and-dump... no.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.888
Not gonna happen.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.523
[Knock on door]

15:41.558 --> 15:44.526
Hey, gentlemen,
we're prepared to indulge you.

15:44.561 --> 15:46.144
[Clears throat]

15:46.146 --> 15:49.698
Abbasi: Detective Escalara
will be sitting in with us,

15:49.733 --> 15:52.534
as per APD policy. Okay with you, right?

15:52.569 --> 15:54.152
Fine with me.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.154
Okay.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.123
You got your lawyer, Mike.
Can we talk already?

15:58.158 --> 16:01.576
Great. So, like we said,

16:01.628 --> 16:04.079
we're here looking into
this Hoffman and Fensky thing.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.631
Yeah, and whatever you can
tell us... anything at all.

16:06.666 --> 16:07.832
Uh, hold on. Hold on.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.468
"Hoffman." "Fensky."

16:10.504 --> 16:12.670
[Smacks lips] Fill me in.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.889
Assume I know absolutely nothing

16:14.925 --> 16:16.307
about my client here, all right?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.560
- Start at the beginning.
- Jesus. Seriously?

16:18.595 --> 16:21.396
Look, don't let
Mr. Ehrmantraut's dancing eyes

16:21.431 --> 16:24.399
and bubbly,
bon vivant personality fool you.

16:24.434 --> 16:28.269
He's actually... believe it
or not... somewhat taciturn.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.940
Shall I fan you gently,
so you don't go into shock?

16:31.992 --> 16:36.444
Start at the beginning, okay?
We're talking book of genesis.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.446
[Pen scribbling] Okay, Mr. McGill,
as you probably gathered,

16:38.498 --> 16:40.281
we, Detective Sanders and I...

16:40.333 --> 16:42.283
work for the Philadelphia
Police Department,

16:42.335 --> 16:44.786
as did Mr. Ehrmantraut for nearly 30 years.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.622
Philadelphia? Go, Eagles.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.624
Mr. Ehrmantraut had a son, Matt.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.459
He, too, was with Philly P.D.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.095
He was a rookie officer with
about two years on the job.

16:54.131 --> 16:56.965
- He was a good cop.
- Yes, he was.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.184
About nine months ago, he responded

16:59.219 --> 17:02.604
to a shots-fired call
in some West Side rattrap.

17:02.639 --> 17:05.223
Matt went in with his partner,
officer Troy Hoffman.

17:05.224 --> 17:08.443
They had sergeant Jack Fensky
backing them up.

17:08.478 --> 17:10.278
Unfortunately, things got out of hand.

17:10.313 --> 17:11.896
The three of them were ambushed,

17:11.897 --> 17:14.315
and, uh, Matt didn't make it out.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.151
Hoffman and Fensky returned fire,

17:16.203 --> 17:17.652
but the shooter got away.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.488
We chased a few leads,
shook up the usual suspects...

17:20.540 --> 17:22.323
came up short.

17:22.375 --> 17:26.661
I'm very sorry to hear it.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.496
Anyways, we kept beating the bushes,

17:28.548 --> 17:31.499
kept coming up dry until three months ago.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.718
That's when Hoffman and Fensky
both turned up dead

17:33.753 --> 17:35.587
in a vacant lot out in nicetown...

17:35.589 --> 17:38.423
Again, an ambush of
some kind, it looks like.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.258
And with whoever killed Matt
out there in the wind,

17:40.260 --> 17:42.677
we're thinking...
Well, it's our operating theory

17:42.729 --> 17:45.096
that Hoffman and Fensky
were mixed up in something,

17:45.098 --> 17:49.100
some bad business,
and maybe that got Matt killed.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.519
Yeah, sorry. I got to do
my lawyer thing here.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.355
Uh, what does my client
have to do with any of this?

17:54.407 --> 17:56.774
Uh, Mike, this is a hail Mary.

17:56.776 --> 17:59.077
Uh, beyond that.

17:59.112 --> 18:01.079
I mean, if we had
any hard evidence or leads,

18:01.114 --> 18:02.447
we wouldn't be out here.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.666
Now, there's anything you can tell us

18:04.701 --> 18:07.118
about what Hoffman and Fensky were into?

18:07.120 --> 18:08.453
Yeah, help us out, Mike.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.538
Help us catch the bastard who killed Matty.

18:14.044 --> 18:16.628
I don't know much about Hoffman and Fensky.

18:16.630 --> 18:20.048
They were Matt's people.
I'd see them around sometimes.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.300
I saw them in a bar the night they died.

18:22.302 --> 18:23.718
It was Mcclure's...

18:23.770 --> 18:27.138
maybe the Red Dog... Probably Mcclure's.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.140
Were they drinking with anyone?

18:29.142 --> 18:30.558
It's a cop bar.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.060
They were drinking with everyone.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.695
Yeah, but did you see them
with anyone in particular?

18:33.730 --> 18:36.314
I couldn't tell you. I was...

18:36.316 --> 18:38.483
You know how I was.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.702
How you doing these days?

18:40.737 --> 18:43.121
Feeling like I crawled out
from the bottom of a bottle

18:43.156 --> 18:45.540
and working hard to stay there.

18:45.575 --> 18:47.742
Although I've got to say...

18:47.794 --> 18:51.079
doesn't help much,
dredging up the past like this.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.914
Let me ask you,

18:52.966 --> 18:56.134
uh, when did you come
out here to Albuquerque?

18:56.169 --> 18:58.970
It couldn't have been, uh, too much later.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.722
I think it was the very next day.

19:00.757 --> 19:04.559
Yeah? The day after Hoffman
and Fensky died, huh?

19:04.594 --> 19:05.894
You didn't think

19:05.929 --> 19:08.313
to, uh, stick around
once you heard the news?

19:08.348 --> 19:11.516
I don't think I heard the news
till I was west of Kansas City.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.901
Still, you, uh...

19:12.936 --> 19:14.736
you didn't come back
for the funerals, correct,

19:14.771 --> 19:16.738
even though Hoffman was Matt's partner?

19:16.773 --> 19:20.742
Sanders: Uh, do you remember anything
about that night at the bar?

19:20.777 --> 19:23.111
Uh, did you talk to
Hoffman or Fensky at all?

19:23.163 --> 19:27.332
Sorry. I got nothing.
They weren't my people.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.534
I'm sorry you guys took a flier on me.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.952
I wish it'd have paid off.

19:31.004 --> 19:34.372
That it? We done here?

19:34.374 --> 19:36.341
We're done here, yeah.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.176
Hey, that wasn't so hard, huh?

19:38.211 --> 19:39.177
Thanks, Mike. Yeah.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.628
Listen, we're probably

19:40.680 --> 19:42.046
gonna kick around
for another couple of days,

19:42.048 --> 19:43.881
in case you think of something, all right?

19:43.883 --> 19:46.884
You know, I've never been out west before.

19:46.886 --> 19:47.885
[Beep]

19:47.887 --> 19:49.304
Oh, hey.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.939
Oh! Oh, shit!

19:50.974 --> 19:52.640
Jesus. Sorry. Sorry. Come on!

19:52.692 --> 19:53.891
Here. I can get most of it.
You got any paper towels?

19:53.893 --> 19:55.310
You know what? Hey, hey. I-I got it.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.728
- I got it. Thank you.
- Sorry.

19:56.730 --> 19:58.563
[Sighs]

20:01.067 --> 20:02.900
[Scoffs]

20:12.045 --> 20:14.996
[Sighs]

20:15.048 --> 20:16.831
[Engine turns over]

20:16.883 --> 20:18.499
Oh, for the love of...

20:18.551 --> 20:22.337
You got to do that right here,
right in front of me?

20:22.389 --> 20:24.339
What's so important in there
that we had to pull

20:24.391 --> 20:27.342
that third-rate Marx brothers routine?

20:27.394 --> 20:29.594
You really want to know?

20:29.596 --> 20:31.929
And risk getting a piece
of an obstruction rap?

20:31.931 --> 20:34.148
No, thank you.

20:34.184 --> 20:36.601
Anything else you want to ask?

20:38.772 --> 20:40.989
How did you know?

20:41.024 --> 20:42.407
Know what?

20:42.442 --> 20:45.843
That... that I would do that, that...

20:45.879 --> 20:47.495
[clears throat]

20:47.530 --> 20:52.917
How did you know that I would,
uh, spill that coffee?

20:52.952 --> 20:55.119
[Chuckles]

20:55.121 --> 20:56.954
What the hell's that?

20:56.956 --> 21:01.376
What's [chuckles] supposed to mean, huh?

21:01.428 --> 21:04.212
Okay, great.
You're the strong, silent type.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.430
Hooray for you.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.765
But in case you missed it,

21:07.801 --> 21:09.183
your friends from Philly back there...

21:09.219 --> 21:11.436
they think you killed two cops.

21:13.556 --> 21:16.357
Yep. [Sighs]

22:02.196 --> 22:03.464
[sighs]

22:03.495 --> 22:04.744
[Dialing]

22:11.105 --> 22:13.489
Yeah, it's me.

22:13.524 --> 22:15.491
We need to talk.

22:15.526 --> 22:17.910
[Insects chirping, dog barking in distance]

22:17.946 --> 22:19.278
[Knock on door]

22:21.199 --> 22:23.666
You call the cops?

22:23.701 --> 22:25.284
What?

22:25.336 --> 22:27.503
Philadelphia P.D. Did you call them?

22:27.538 --> 22:29.705
- Y-yeah, I did.
- Why?

22:29.707 --> 22:31.707
Well, I told them I heard
about Hoffman and Fensky and...

22:31.709 --> 22:33.542
and what?

22:33.544 --> 22:35.544
And you don't think it's strange?

22:35.546 --> 22:39.932
First Matt, then not six months
later, his partner and his sergeant?

22:39.968 --> 22:42.551
Yeah, I called them
to help catch Matty's killer.

22:42.553 --> 22:44.553
Mike, what if the same person,

22:44.555 --> 22:46.555
if the... what if
the piece of shit who got Matty

22:46.557 --> 22:49.775
- got them, too?
- And what exactly did you tell them?

22:49.811 --> 22:51.678
- I told them...
- You tell them Matt was dirty...

22:51.710 --> 22:53.159
- Is that what you told them?
- I...

22:53.210 --> 22:54.843
How could you possibly think that?

22:54.878 --> 22:56.961
That's your husband,
the father of your child.

22:56.963 --> 23:00.215
I didn't say that. I s...
I told them I found money.

23:00.267 --> 23:02.550
After Kaylee and I moved here,
when I was unpacking,

23:02.602 --> 23:04.969
it was in the lining of an old suitcase.

23:04.971 --> 23:08.390
Matt must have tucked it away in
there, 'cause this was cash...

23:08.442 --> 23:12.027
$5,000, $6,000 from God knows where.

23:12.062 --> 23:13.862
I mean, we were basically
paycheck to paycheck.

23:13.897 --> 23:15.280
Where the hell did he get it?

23:15.315 --> 23:17.115
Why didn't you ask me?

23:17.150 --> 23:18.733
- [Sighs]
- Why didn't you come to me?

23:18.785 --> 23:20.368
I couldn't.

23:20.404 --> 23:22.287
- I knew what it would do to you.
- [Sighs]

23:22.322 --> 23:23.955
First, he's murdered,

23:23.990 --> 23:25.407
and then for you to think...

23:25.459 --> 23:27.042
I... it would have burned you to the ground.

23:27.077 --> 23:29.461
There would be nothing left.

23:29.496 --> 23:31.796
And you wouldn't talk to me.

23:31.832 --> 23:34.416
Every night, you were
drinking yourself unconscious,

23:34.468 --> 23:37.502
like you were the only one who lost him.

23:37.504 --> 23:38.420
Look, I don't care.

23:38.503 --> 23:40.138
He was dirty, he was clean... I don't care.

23:40.173 --> 23:42.090
All I want is for whoever killed Matty

23:42.142 --> 23:44.342
to rot in a cell
for the rest of their life,

23:44.344 --> 23:46.061
and then I want whatever's left of them

23:46.096 --> 23:48.063
just dumped in the trash...
that's what I want.

23:48.098 --> 23:50.396
I don't care where it leads,
what it uncovers.

23:50.896 --> 23:52.897
I mean, what difference would it make

23:52.996 --> 23:55.997
if he was... Anything?

23:55.999 --> 23:57.415
I'd still love him.

23:57.467 --> 23:59.667
I'd still miss him. He'd still be gone.

23:59.669 --> 24:01.719
Matt wasn't dirty.

24:01.755 --> 24:03.921
Well, so be straight with me!

24:03.973 --> 24:05.757
Right now. This is it, Mike.

24:05.809 --> 24:08.342
What was that phone call before he died?

24:08.344 --> 24:09.811
Don't bullshit me.

24:09.846 --> 24:12.897
[Voice breaking] That was
between me and my son.

24:12.932 --> 24:15.066
So you're admitting it was you.

24:15.101 --> 24:16.601
He wasn't dirty!

24:16.653 --> 24:20.822
God damn you!
You get that through your head!

24:20.857 --> 24:24.692
My son wasn't dirty!

24:27.563 --> 24:29.614
[Door slams]

Even looking like you're doing
the right thing to those two

39:26.487 --> 39:30.857
meant that he wasn't solid,
that he couldn't be trusted.

39:35.864 --> 39:38.281
I got Matty to take the money.

39:42.287 --> 39:45.121
