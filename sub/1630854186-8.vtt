WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:04.572
Previously on Young Sheldon...
We are at capacity.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.207
It's time to expand.

00:06.307 --> 00:08.008
Where?
The video store

00:08.109 --> 00:09.810
right behind that wall

00:09.910 --> 00:11.745
just lost its lease.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.081
So, you're telling me
there's nothing weird

00:13.181 --> 00:14.415
going on back there?

00:16.050 --> 00:17.351
Oh, my God.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.487
Is it legal?
No.
Yes.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.189
Too bad there's not
a comic book database

00:21.289 --> 00:23.224
so I can search through it
and find what I'm looking for.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.892
Well, CERN
has something similar.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.361
You can search a database
of scientific papers.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.363
But there's no database
for comic books.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.632
You should make one.
Somewhere else.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.501
Could it be used
to catalogue

00:33.601 --> 00:34.702
other things?

00:34.802 --> 00:36.570
Yes, the applications
are endless.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.806
Ooh, there could be ones
for scientific grants.

00:38.906 --> 00:40.941
Funding grants is such
a time-consuming process.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.576
If there was
a centralized database,

00:42.676 --> 00:44.345
it would change
the research landscape entirely.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.680
Do you see what this could do
for the scientific community?

00:46.780 --> 00:49.483
We could charge an access fee to
every university on the planet,

00:49.583 --> 00:51.985
then I could retire on a yacht
in the Bahamas.

00:52.086 --> 00:52.986
You're missing the point.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.222
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:54.322 --> 00:55.823
Uh, good for science. I love it.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.794
ADULT SHELDON: People say French
is the language of love,

01:00.894 --> 01:05.032
but for me, nothing is sweeter
than the exhilarating sounds

01:05.133 --> 01:07.201
of legalese. Ooh, la, la.

01:07.301 --> 01:10.238
The same could not be said
for my parents.

01:10.338 --> 01:11.272
Uh...

01:11.372 --> 01:12.340
(stammers)

01:12.440 --> 01:13.441
And which one are we?

01:13.541 --> 01:14.575
"The-the party
of the first part"

01:14.675 --> 01:16.009
or "the party
of the second part"?

01:16.110 --> 01:17.578
(laughs) The first part,

01:17.678 --> 01:19.413
but either way, it's a party.

01:19.513 --> 01:22.015
Speaking of which,
can I get you a beer?

01:22.116 --> 01:24.285
Y-You're a Lone Star man, right?

01:24.385 --> 01:25.886
Matter of fact, I am.
George.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.355
She offered.
I don't want to be rude.

01:27.455 --> 01:28.389
It's 11:00 a.m.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.391
Well, you just let me know.

01:30.491 --> 01:31.959
We'll get you anything you want.

01:32.059 --> 01:34.094
We're fine, thank you.
(clears throat)

01:34.195 --> 01:36.164
So, you really think
this invention of Sheldon's

01:36.264 --> 01:37.465
could be worth something?

01:37.565 --> 01:39.367
Oh, who knows?
Uh, most of the time,

01:39.467 --> 01:41.001
these things don't pan out.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.604
Could be something,
probably nothing. (laughs)

01:43.704 --> 01:46.140
Uh, that's just a formality.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.476
But you said my grant database

01:48.576 --> 01:50.444
would make the university
"boatloads of money."

01:50.544 --> 01:52.446
Well, that doesn't
mean anything.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.182
Boats can be small. (laughs)

01:54.282 --> 01:55.649
Ever hear of a canoe?

01:55.749 --> 01:58.186
Anyway, who needs a pen?

01:58.286 --> 01:59.753
What's this about the university

01:59.853 --> 02:03.123
owning 90% and Sheldon
only owning ten?

02:03.224 --> 02:05.025
Oh, that's just
standard boilerplate.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.660
Did you know that
boilerplate originally

02:06.760 --> 02:07.928
referred to the
roll of steel

02:08.028 --> 02:10.030
used as a template
to create steam boilers,

02:10.130 --> 02:11.899
but then was adapted
to the legal profession

02:11.999 --> 02:13.634
to describe the way
companies use fine print

02:13.734 --> 02:15.068
to get around the law?

02:16.470 --> 02:18.606
Ugh, that fact is just so fun.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.241
You see? It is a party.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.610
And what's a party
without Yoo-hoo?

02:22.710 --> 02:24.545
Can I get you a cold one?

02:24.645 --> 02:25.879
Yes, please.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.715
No. We want to make
sure that Sheldon

02:27.815 --> 02:29.016
is being treated fairly.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.018
Yeah, maybe we should get
our own lawyer

02:31.118 --> 02:33.187
to take a look at this
before we sign anything.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.688
Can we afford a lawyer?

02:37.124 --> 02:39.893
Okay, w-we're gonna need
some time to get back to you.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.796
Of course.
You take all the time you need.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.498
You know, just
because of all

02:44.598 --> 02:47.768
the nice things we've done for
your son and for your family,

02:47.868 --> 02:50.938
no need to start
trusting us now.

02:51.038 --> 02:54.642
She took that
better than I thought.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.645
* Nobody else
is stronger than I am *

02:57.745 --> 03:00.281
* Yesterday I moved a mountain *

03:00.381 --> 03:02.650
* I bet I could be your hero *

03:02.750 --> 03:05.719
* I am a mighty little man *

03:05.819 --> 03:09.890
* I am a mighty little man. *

03:15.763 --> 03:17.465
Dang, it's busy in here
for a weekday.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.533
Social Security checks landed.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.270
Hm. Getting paid
just to be old-- must be nice.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.437
I ain't complaining.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.672
Listen, this cash box

03:24.772 --> 03:26.240
is full. Take some of this up

03:26.340 --> 03:28.942
and stick it in the register
in the video store.

03:29.042 --> 03:29.977
You got it.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.412
And don't be
flirting with Mandy.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.680
I need help back here.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.548
Okay, but she might
flirt with me.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.917
This shirt really
brings out my eyes.

03:39.152 --> 03:40.454
(door closes)

03:40.554 --> 03:42.122
How's it going?
Figure everything out?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.425
People give me money,
I give them movies.

03:44.525 --> 03:45.759
I think I got it.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.761
Smart, pregnant,
you're the whole package.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.730
I'd like to return this movie.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.732
Okay, thank you. Come again.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.101
I can't believe
you would rent this filth.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.870
It's not filth.
It's Basic Instinct.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.439
Well, my husband was watching it

03:58.539 --> 04:00.574
and there was a woman in there
who showed her hoo-ha.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.042
Yeah, she does.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.711
Come on, I mean,
you don't see the whole thing.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.613
At most, you
see a "hoo."

04:05.713 --> 04:08.015
If you see the "hoo,"
the "ha's" right there.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.284
Whatever it was, it's sinful.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.420
Why don't you pick out
something else? On the house.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.722
I don't know why you'd carry
something like this.

04:14.822 --> 04:15.856
People like it.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.157
I've seen it three times.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.992
Do you really want
to bring your baby

04:19.092 --> 04:22.062
into a world where this
is considered entertainment?

04:23.964 --> 04:26.199
Lady, why don't you
let me worry about my baby

04:26.300 --> 04:28.636
and, uh, you worry about
what your husband's watching.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.372
Easy, she's still
a customer.

04:31.472 --> 04:32.640
Not anymore.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.074
And I'm gonna tell
my prayer group

04:34.174 --> 04:35.343
not to come here either.

04:35.443 --> 04:37.511
(scoffs) Okay, you do that.
We have family

04:37.611 --> 04:38.846
entertainment as well.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.114
Sound of Music.
No one shows nothing.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.517
Three times, really?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.085
I'm 17.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.356
Well, I don't know,
you're the lawyer.

04:48.456 --> 04:50.491
You know,
if this invention's big,

04:50.591 --> 04:51.825
mama wants a taste.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.561
President Hagemeyer,
a word.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.396
Here's a word: out.

04:55.496 --> 04:56.764
I understand
you're moving forward

04:56.864 --> 04:58.432
with Sheldon's
grant database.

04:58.532 --> 04:59.900
I was an intrinsic
part of that.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.802
Hm, Sheldon didn't mention you.

05:01.902 --> 05:04.638
Of course he didn't, that
pint-sized little credit hog.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.640
Do I need to redo
these contracts?

05:06.740 --> 05:08.909
You betcha.
All right, just hold on.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.277
This is good
for the university.

05:10.378 --> 05:11.879
This isn't about everybody

05:11.979 --> 05:13.547
getting a piece of the pie.

05:13.647 --> 05:16.584
Oh, really? In that contract,
does she get a piece of the pie?

05:16.684 --> 05:18.586
Uh...
Don't answer that,

05:18.686 --> 05:20.253
attorney-client whatever.

05:20.354 --> 05:23.023
Uh, technically my services
are paid for by the uni...

05:23.123 --> 05:24.558
Shut up, Ken.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.159
Linda, be reasonable.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.695
I am.

05:27.795 --> 05:30.230
After all the Sheldon I've
put up with, I deserve this.

05:30.330 --> 05:33.767
You deserve this? My office
is basically his clubhouse.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.269
Okay, I tell you what I'll do.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.806
If Sheldon's okay with it,

05:38.906 --> 05:40.708
you're welcome
to part of his cut.

05:40.808 --> 05:42.610
That's not you
doing anything.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.346
Hi there, Connie.

05:46.447 --> 05:48.516
Pastor Jeff.
What can I do for you?

05:48.616 --> 05:52.152
I was hoping we could chat
about your video store.

05:52.252 --> 05:53.153
What about it?

05:53.253 --> 05:55.088
I'm just so glad

05:55.188 --> 05:57.958
it's in the hands
of a good Christian woman.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.359
Where you headed here, padre?

05:59.460 --> 06:01.395
(clears throat)
Well, some of my flock

06:01.495 --> 06:03.697
have concerns about
the movies y'all rent.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.499
You know,
the ones with the

06:05.599 --> 06:07.334
sexual content

06:07.435 --> 06:08.902
and whatnot.

06:09.002 --> 06:11.004
If they don't want
to see whatnot,

06:11.104 --> 06:12.973
then they shouldn't
rent whatnot.

06:13.073 --> 06:16.577
I hear you. God gave us
free will. (chuckles)

06:16.677 --> 06:18.378
But you're renting temptation.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.213
And you know who tempts us?

06:20.313 --> 06:21.649
The devil.

06:22.583 --> 06:23.717
So, that's who's making me

06:23.817 --> 06:25.252
want to slam this door
in your face.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.320
I'm just here
to give you a heads-up.

06:27.421 --> 06:28.722
People are upset

06:28.822 --> 06:31.759
and I'd hate to see
your business suffer.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.527
Are you threatening me?

06:33.627 --> 06:35.162
No, uh, I'm sorry.

06:35.262 --> 06:37.731
Uh, let me just
take off my pastor hat,

06:37.831 --> 06:39.667
put on my neighbor cap,

06:39.767 --> 06:41.134
and start again.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.303
I'm gonna put on my hat, too.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.573
It's got a big foam finger
on top of it.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.107
Guess which one.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.275
The naughty one?

06:48.375 --> 06:49.977
Bingo.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.880
* *

06:52.980 --> 06:55.348
Mr. Vance, thank you for taking
the time to see us.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.884
Oh, no problem.
(chuckles)

06:56.984 --> 06:59.419
You know,
I don't ordinarily handle

06:59.520 --> 07:01.489
intellectual property contracts,

07:01.589 --> 07:03.491
I'm more of a slip-and-fall guy.

07:03.591 --> 07:06.359
I have seen your face
on those park bench ads.

07:06.460 --> 07:09.396
Oh, you fall in the park,
this is the first thing

07:09.497 --> 07:11.064
you see.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.833
So, as I said on the phone,

07:12.933 --> 07:16.036
our son invented something that
his university's interested in,

07:16.136 --> 07:18.639
but we feel they might be
trying to keep

07:18.739 --> 07:20.073
the lion's share for themselves.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.576
You really think
it's gonna be worth something?

07:22.676 --> 07:25.779
University seems to think so.
They want 90% of it.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.948
Oh, is that so?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.017
What's the invention?

07:30.117 --> 07:32.052
We don't really understand it.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.855
Oh, you know, it's a computer...

07:34.955 --> 07:36.289
thing.
(scoffs)

07:36.389 --> 07:38.992
Adding machine and carbon paper
got me this far.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.360
Mm.

07:40.460 --> 07:41.562
What... what am I smelling?

07:41.662 --> 07:43.797
Beef and broccoli.

07:43.897 --> 07:45.465
Chinese place downstairs.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.835
Ooh, do they have good chop
suey? I can never find good...

07:47.935 --> 07:50.103
George.
You were saying?

07:52.506 --> 07:55.075
Sheldon, we need to talk.

07:55.175 --> 07:58.045
You should keep your voice down.
This is a library.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.382
Do you remember when
we came up with the idea

08:02.482 --> 08:03.817
for that grant database?

08:03.917 --> 08:05.686
I remember when
I came up with the idea.

08:05.786 --> 08:07.154
Uh, in my office.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.055
In my brain.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.223
Which was in my office.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.692
And, as I recall,

08:11.792 --> 08:13.493
I was the one who suggested
you build a database.

08:13.594 --> 08:16.630
No, you suggested I build
a comic book database.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.567
Which was the underlying idea.

08:19.667 --> 08:22.235
Fire is the underlying idea
for the nuclear power plant,

08:22.335 --> 08:24.171
and no one credits the caveman.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.207
Son...

08:27.307 --> 08:29.943
and I call you son because
I think of you as family.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.846
Is this the way you would
treat your own family?

08:32.946 --> 08:36.016
Not my mom.
Everyone else is on their own.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.821
JEFF (in distance):
Thank you for saying no to sin!

08:40.921 --> 08:44.457
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

08:46.694 --> 08:47.995
What are you doing?

08:48.095 --> 08:49.997
We're just asking people
to sign our petition

08:50.097 --> 08:53.333
if they agree that sin
has no place in cinema.

08:53.433 --> 08:55.335
Huh. Clever.
Thanks.

08:55.435 --> 08:58.405
And God doesn't want us
seeing people's private parts.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.540
Didn't he make people's
private parts?

09:00.641 --> 09:04.011
He did, and then he made clothes
to cover 'em right up.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.747
(sighs) You are scaring
away my customers.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.548
You know what's scarier? Hell.

09:08.649 --> 09:11.619
Look, you can't just sit here
in front of my store.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.587
Freedom of speech.
we're allowed.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.656
And we're allowed
to rent whatever movies we want.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.024
People can choose
for themselves.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.558
They sure can.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.829
If you love God
and hate the devil, sign here.

09:21.929 --> 09:25.498
Where is your halo? 'Cause
you are an angel. (chuckles)

09:27.200 --> 09:29.837
Let's just see what
the people think about this.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.442
Yeah.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.116
MEEMAW:
What are you doing? We just

09:43.216 --> 09:44.584
finally got those
killjoys out of here.

09:44.685 --> 09:45.853
Yeah, it was amazing.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.621
Have you two lost your minds?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.222
We do not need
this kind of attention.

09:49.322 --> 09:50.991
Attention's good.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.726
Like, free advertising.

09:52.826 --> 09:54.762
We're running an illegal
gambling room in the back.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.630
Oh, that'll be fine.
For you.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.732
If we get arrested,
y'all go to lady jail.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.468
I have to go to scary jail.
I'm too pretty for scary jail.

10:01.568 --> 10:02.903
No more prison movies for you.

10:03.003 --> 10:05.538
So you're saying
we should just give in,

10:05.639 --> 10:08.308
after what that
holy-rolling Muppet

10:08.408 --> 10:10.477
has done to your whole family?

10:10.577 --> 10:12.479
He does look like a Muppet.

10:12.579 --> 10:14.081
All I'm saying is
we need to remember

10:14.181 --> 10:15.816
where the real money's
coming from.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.786
If we want it to keep coming,
you got to back off.

10:20.187 --> 10:23.523
Okay, fine. I'll behave.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.626
When did you start
to be the responsible one?

10:26.727 --> 10:29.096
Hey, I don't like it, either.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.967
Ah, just the young genius
I was hoping to see.

10:34.768 --> 10:37.104
Look, I've heard
from your parents' lawyer,

10:37.204 --> 10:39.539
and I'm a little concerned

10:39.639 --> 10:41.909
that this whole thing
is getting out of hand.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.177
How so?
Well, you know,
lawyers get involved

10:44.277 --> 10:47.514
and everything slows down
and, well, I'm just worried

10:47.614 --> 10:49.516
that someone else might come up

10:49.616 --> 10:51.318
with the same idea
in the meantime.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.553
I didn't think of that.
We should get started.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.689
I agree, but, well,
we can't get started

10:55.789 --> 10:57.524
until the paperwork is signed.

10:57.624 --> 10:59.659
Ugh! Those darn lawyers.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.294
Well, how can we fix this?

11:01.394 --> 11:05.198
Hmm. Well, I guess

11:05.298 --> 11:09.169
if you could, well,
convince your parents to sign,

11:09.269 --> 11:10.871
then we could get rolling.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.042
And to make it worth your while,

11:15.142 --> 11:18.812
how about we put your name
on one of these buildings?

11:18.912 --> 11:22.249
How would you feel about
"Sheldon Cooper Science Center"?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.718
I'm sorry. Did you say,
"Sheldon Cooper Science Center,"

11:24.818 --> 11:27.054
or "Sheldon Cooper's
Science Center"?

11:27.154 --> 11:28.188
Well, which do you like?

11:28.288 --> 11:29.322
I prefer the possessive.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.758
It makes it much more mine.

11:30.858 --> 11:33.560
Then "Sheldon Cooper's
Science Center" it is.

11:33.660 --> 11:36.196
(laughs)
So, do we have a deal?

11:36.296 --> 11:37.965
Okay.
Excellent.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.601
Now get out of here
before I pinch those cheeks.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.371
(sighs)

11:44.471 --> 11:46.039
(knocking)

11:46.139 --> 11:48.976
I will remind you
my wife is a police officer.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.812
I've just come
with a little peace offering.

11:52.980 --> 11:57.017
My last copy of Basic Instinct.

11:57.117 --> 12:01.221
So there you go.
No more naked ladies,

12:01.321 --> 12:02.455
no more Michael Douglas'

12:02.555 --> 12:05.658
bare butt giving me
impure thoughts.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.862
The town is safe again.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.264
Well, thank you
for seeing reason.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.201
Well, what kind of good
Christian woman would I be

12:14.301 --> 12:15.468
if I didn't?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.805
(chuckles)
So, we square?

12:17.905 --> 12:20.673
It's not about you and me
being square, Connie.

12:20.774 --> 12:24.511
It's about you
and El Jefe Grande.

12:24.611 --> 12:27.514
Mm-hmm.

12:27.614 --> 12:30.017
Well, goodbye.

12:30.117 --> 12:32.319
You know,
I'd be happy to come down

12:32.419 --> 12:34.287
and let you know what
other movies are objectionable

12:34.387 --> 12:37.224
so we don't have
another situation on our hands.

12:37.324 --> 12:41.028
You want to take
more movies out of my store?

12:41.128 --> 12:43.630
Again, not me,
but there's a guy with a thumb

12:43.730 --> 12:46.066
a lot bigger
than Siskel or Ebert's.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.172
Sheldon, thank you
for coming in.

12:52.272 --> 12:55.275
I want to apologize
for our little tiff earlier.

12:55.375 --> 12:56.376
You're forgiven.

12:56.476 --> 12:57.911
Oh. Great.

12:58.011 --> 13:02.315
I found something that might
be of interest to you.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.518
An authentic signature
from Richard Feynman.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.786
Where did you get this?

13:06.887 --> 13:08.121
Details aren't important.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.490
Is this a restraining order?
Not important.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.059
That's actually a really
good way to get autographs.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.760
I'll have to keep that in mind.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.963
Well, it's yours, from
one scientist to another,

13:16.063 --> 13:17.430
and that's my point, really.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.333
You and I-- we need
to stick together.
Why?

13:20.433 --> 13:22.802
Because this university
is filled with people

13:22.903 --> 13:24.671
who want to exploit our ideas.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.206
That's not my experience.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.141
President Hagemeyer
just offered me my own building.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.210
You're being manipulated,
you don't even know it.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.412
Sheldon, I've seen this
a thousand times--

13:32.512 --> 13:36.283
a brilliant young mind
like yours taken advantage of.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.085
But isn't that
what you're trying to do?

13:38.185 --> 13:39.920
Absolutely not.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.821
President Hagemeyer's
was a bribe.

13:41.922 --> 13:45.825
That is a gift
from one peer to another.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.895
(laughs)
So what do you say?

13:47.995 --> 13:49.629
Are you a scientist

13:49.729 --> 13:51.464
or are you a pawn
of the administration?

13:51.564 --> 13:52.732
A scientist.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.567
Yes, you are. (laughs)

13:54.667 --> 13:56.369
So, we have a deal?

13:56.469 --> 13:59.006
Okay.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.707
MEEMAW:
I'd like to order

14:00.807 --> 14:03.010
five more copies
of Basic Instinct

14:03.110 --> 14:07.014
and a couple more
of Fatal Attraction.

14:07.114 --> 14:10.650
Anything else?
Ooh, uh, get a
Last Temptation of Christ.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.152
That'll really
piss people off.

14:12.252 --> 14:15.322
And a copy of
The Last Temptation of Christ

14:15.422 --> 14:16.723
to really piss people off.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.625
Thank you.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.293
What are y'all doing?

14:20.393 --> 14:22.729
Well, I tried to be nice
but he kept pushing.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.264
Yeah, so now we're pushing back.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.598
Why do you care?

14:25.698 --> 14:27.000
Because I don't like
anybody telling me how

14:27.100 --> 14:28.902
to run my business,
especially him.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.038
This is not your business.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.240
That room back there
with the shady piles of money--

14:33.340 --> 14:36.776
that's your business.
Your secret, illegal business.

14:36.876 --> 14:38.645
So, what, are we just supposed

14:38.745 --> 14:40.747
to become
a Christian video store now?

14:40.847 --> 14:42.782
You know what?
In this town, I...

14:42.882 --> 14:45.485
No! I am not
gonna let that man win.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.754
Hi. I'm with Channel 7 news.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.356
Can I help you?

14:49.456 --> 14:52.592
A local pastor has put together
a petition of citizens

14:52.692 --> 14:55.762
concerned about the vulgar
content of your video store.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.164
Would you care to comment?

14:57.264 --> 14:59.766
Damn straight I would.
I want him to know...

14:59.866 --> 15:01.834
Give me. Give me.
No, give me that. I want...

15:03.070 --> 15:04.771
I can assure you
there's nothing immoral

15:04.871 --> 15:06.940
or indecent going on here.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.214
Mm. So, we were talking
to the lawyer...

15:14.314 --> 15:16.049
Here comes the divorce.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.584
We are not getting divorced.

15:17.684 --> 15:18.918
Then why do we have a lawyer?

15:19.019 --> 15:20.220
Sheldon invented something

15:20.320 --> 15:21.488
that the university's
interested in

15:21.588 --> 15:23.323
and it could be
worth some money.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.092
You always were
my favorite brother.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.327
This morning you licked your
finger and put it in my ear.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.761
That means I like you.

15:28.861 --> 15:30.663
Anyway, the lawyer
wants to sit down with you

15:30.763 --> 15:32.699
before he gets into it
with the university.

15:32.799 --> 15:35.168
I don't know. I hear
lawyers slow things down.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.303
What?

15:36.403 --> 15:37.971
Shelly, this is for your future.

15:38.071 --> 15:41.374
We're just trying to make sure
that you're taken care of.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.010
I don't care about money.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.179
Well, someday you might when
you have your own wife and kids.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.780
I don't see that happening.

15:47.880 --> 15:50.583
No one sees that happening.
And I say that with love.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.652
Sheldon, this is important
to all of us.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.988
Uh, you got to think
about your family.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.723
Shelly, he's right.

15:56.823 --> 16:00.193
Did you put extra hot dogs
in this spaghetti?

16:00.293 --> 16:01.961
I did.

16:02.929 --> 16:05.832
Okay, I'll talk with the lawyer.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.835
(whispering):
You're good.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.939
Well, I'm-I'm so glad that
we can all sit down together.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.809
And I have a feeling we are
gonna come to a quick agreement.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.380
I have a feeling we are.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.881
So, I have redrawn
the contracts...

16:21.981 --> 16:23.516
Sorry we're late.

16:23.616 --> 16:25.785
What are you doing here?
And who's he?

16:25.885 --> 16:27.487
I'm his cousin.
And lawyer.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.222
Really, Grant?

16:29.322 --> 16:31.224
Yeah, really.
Let me talk for you.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.525
Yeah, really.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.362
Okay. Fine, fine. Stay.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.198
It really doesn't make
any difference because

16:38.298 --> 16:41.968
Sheldon agrees that this is in
the best interest of everyone.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.304
You said that?
Yes.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.973
Hold on. Sheldon told me...
Grant.

16:48.608 --> 16:49.776
Sheldon informed my client

16:49.876 --> 16:52.011
that their interests
were aligned.

16:52.112 --> 16:54.147
You told him that?
Yes.

16:54.247 --> 16:55.248
You told me

16:55.348 --> 16:56.249
he was on our side.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.984
Didn't you tell them that?

16:58.085 --> 16:58.985
Yes.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.587
Which is it, Sheldon?

17:00.687 --> 17:03.856
Yeah, Sheldon.
Whose side are you on?

17:03.956 --> 17:05.692
Shelly?

17:06.493 --> 17:09.262
I don't know and I don't care.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.663
I just want
to build the database.

17:10.763 --> 17:13.300
Why can't this just
be about the science?

17:13.400 --> 17:15.835
W-Why are you making it
all about the money?

17:16.636 --> 17:19.339
This was supposed to be
exciting, and you're ruining it.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.843
Oh...

17:23.943 --> 17:26.813
I'm telling you,
I can do it on my own.

17:26.913 --> 17:28.248
Shelly?

17:29.048 --> 17:31.284
I don't want to be
in the middle anymore.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.321
I know. I...
I came out to apologize.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.855
We made that all about us

17:35.955 --> 17:37.890
and it should be
about what you want.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.592
Thanks.

17:39.692 --> 17:43.563
So... why don't you take
a little time

17:43.663 --> 17:46.032
and figure out
what's gonna make you happy?

17:46.133 --> 17:47.300
I will.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.668
Okay, I did.

17:48.768 --> 17:52.004
Oh. All right.
Well, what did you decide?

17:52.105 --> 17:54.841
I'm cutting everybody out
and doing this myself.
What?

17:54.941 --> 17:57.377
I don't need the university
and I don't need Dr. Linkletter.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.312
How are you gonna
pay for all this?

17:59.412 --> 18:00.813
I'll find private investors.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.749
They can pay for it
on the condition I'm left alone.

18:02.849 --> 18:06.052
Are you sure you don't want to
think about this a little more?

18:06.153 --> 18:07.554
Perhaps you're right.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.989
Done. I'm good.
Where you going?

18:10.089 --> 18:12.325
My dorm. I have some calls
to make. Love you.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.627
Love you, too.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.507
Don't you have Die Hard?

18:27.607 --> 18:29.742
Not anymore.
Why?

18:29.842 --> 18:32.011
It had that bad word in it.

18:32.111 --> 18:36.349
What?
"Yippee-ki-yay," etcetera.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.352
This store sucks.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.687
We know.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.190
Maybe you'd like
The Singing Nun.
Nope.

18:44.491 --> 18:48.094
Has anybody ever rented
The Singing Nun?

18:50.597 --> 18:52.031
Just Pastor Jeff.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.633
That figures.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.101
Wait a minute.

18:55.202 --> 18:57.437
You can see all the movies

18:57.537 --> 18:59.839
that Pastor Jeff ever rented?
You can see

18:59.939 --> 19:01.641
any movie everyone's rented.

19:01.741 --> 19:03.243
Well, let's just see

19:03.343 --> 19:06.078
if he's as pious
as he pretends to be.

19:06.179 --> 19:09.682
Let's find out. (grunts)

19:09.782 --> 19:10.783
(typing)

19:10.883 --> 19:13.152
Jesus Christ Superstar,

19:13.253 --> 19:15.755
Jesus of Nazareth,

19:15.855 --> 19:17.023
The Blood of Jesus.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.358
Good Lord.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.992
How many Jesus movies are there?

19:20.092 --> 19:21.661
Oh, what about his wife?

19:21.761 --> 19:24.163
Oh.
Mm.

19:24.264 --> 19:27.267
Show me, show me.
Mm.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.703
Hello, Pastor Jeff.

19:30.803 --> 19:32.071
(door closes)
Hey there, Connie.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.606
What brings you by?

19:33.706 --> 19:37.844
I just wanted to drop off
a little gift.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.479
Dirty Dancing?

19:39.579 --> 19:41.848
I think you know
how I feel about this movie.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.750
I do.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.486
I also know how your wife
feels about it.

19:46.586 --> 19:47.720
What?

19:47.820 --> 19:49.222
She's rented it five times.

19:49.322 --> 19:52.091
That's a lot
of shirtless Patrick Swayze.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.926
Must be some mistake.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.963
There isn't. Shall we talk about
Fatal Attraction?

19:57.063 --> 19:59.098
Do we have to?
Six times.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.968
Are you blackmailing me?
Yeah.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.403
Well, it's not gonna work.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.705
I'm a man of principles
and I stand by them.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.674
And I respect that.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.778
So let's talk about what your
church elders are renting.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.780
Oh, come on.
Want to know?

20:13.880 --> 20:14.981
Is it bad?

20:15.081 --> 20:18.050
It's Porky's bad.
(whimpers)

20:18.150 --> 20:19.986
How your principles feeling now?

20:20.753 --> 20:22.455
ADULT SHELDON:
I'm going to end this story

20:22.555 --> 20:24.957
so you don't have to see
a grown man beg for mercy.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.659
Connie, please...
