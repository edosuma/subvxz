I WAS JUST WONDERING,

00:13.447 --> 00:16.050
WHERE DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE GOING WITH THAT COOKIE?

00:18.152 --> 00:20.788
PUT THE COOKIE DOWN!

00:20.821 --> 00:24.725
NO, NO, NO, NOT YOU,
MR. LASORDA. NO.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.560
DID I--I SCARED YOU?

00:26.594 --> 00:28.496
OH, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SCARE YOU.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.665
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE EATING A COOKIE.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.576

00:42.610 --> 00:43.711

00:43.744 --> 00:45.713

ATMOSPHERE, HUH?

00:47.515 --> 00:49.283

00:49.317 --> 00:51.119
THAT'S WHY
THE POPE EATS HERE.

00:53.121 --> 00:54.522
HEY, YOU THINK
HE REALLY SAID,

00:54.555 --> 00:59.160
"TO MY BUDDY NEMO,
YOUR PIZZA IS INFALLIBLE"?

00:59.193 --> 01:00.428
- HEY, HE'S GOOD LUCK.

01:00.461 --> 01:02.296
- YEAH. LINDA AND I
GOT A PICTURE OF HIM

01:02.330 --> 01:03.397
DOWN AT THE SHOP
RIDING A JET SKI.

01:03.431 --> 01:05.499
- NO.

01:05.533 --> 01:07.535

01:16.410 --> 01:17.811
I DIDN'T ORDER FOREPLAY.

01:21.349 --> 01:24.785
- YOU OKAY, HONEY?

01:55.616 --> 01:57.518
HEY, THAT'S TONGUE!

01:57.551 --> 01:59.187
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A VEGETARIAN.

01:59.220 --> 02:02.856

IN FRONT OF ANYBODY?

02:02.890 --> 02:05.793

02:37.525 --> 02:39.393
"I COULD HAVE BEEN
A CONTENDER."

02:39.427 --> 02:41.629
- AWW! HELLO, DEARS.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.197
- WERE YOU
IN MY OFFICE, MA?

02:43.231 --> 02:44.598
- YEAH. I WAS
TRYING TO GET A PEN

02:44.632 --> 02:48.536
TO DO THE CROSSWORDS.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.605
YOU KNOW
YOUR DESK DRAWER IS LOCKED?

02:51.639 --> 02:52.906
- UH, YEAH,
WE LOCK IT NOW.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.208
- OH?

02:54.242 --> 02:55.376
- YEAH.
IT KEEPS THE KIDS OUT.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.345
- OH!
HA, HA, HA!

02:57.378 --> 02:59.413
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

02:59.447 --> 03:00.914
I BROKE A KNIFE IN IT.

03:04.252 --> 03:06.754
- OKAY,
LET'S GET TO BED, ALLY.

03:06.787 --> 03:07.855
- HEY.

03:12.660 --> 03:13.761
SHOWER'S BROKEN.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.667
MUST'VE BEEN LOOSE,
'CAUSE WHEN I FIDDLED WITH IT,

03:19.700 --> 03:21.835
IT CAME RIGHT OUT
OF THE WALL.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.337
- OH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:23.371 --> 03:25.339
WHAT'RE YOU TAKING A SHOWER
OVER HERE FOR?

03:25.373 --> 03:28.909
- WELL, HE CAME HOME FROM WORK,
AND WE WERE HERE,

03:28.942 --> 03:30.344
AND YOU KNOW YOUR BROTHER.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.646
HE DOESN'T LIKE TO BE
ALONE IN THE HOUSE.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.348
- CAN WE GO NOW?
I'M COLD.

03:34.382 --> 03:37.518
- OH, SURE, SWEETIE.
COME ON, LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.320
- UH, THAT'S MY TOWEL.

03:40.788 --> 03:43.724
BUT WE CAN
GET IT LATER.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.859
- I'LL PATCH THE SHOWER UP
FOR YOU TOMORROW.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.661
- OF COURSE YOU WILL.

03:47.695 --> 03:51.265
- YOU KNOW THAT SHAMPOO
THAT SAYS "NO MORE TEARS"?

03:51.299 --> 03:52.600
- YEAH.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.302
- THERE'S TEARS.

04:00.774 --> 04:04.645
- OH, YEAH.
DEFINITELY BROKEN.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.815
YOU KNOW
HOW I COULD TELL?

04:07.848 --> 04:10.451
THERE SHOULD BE
A BATHROOM RIGHT HERE.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.455
YOU KNOW, IT'S GOT TO BE
HARD ON ROBERT

04:14.488 --> 04:16.424
BEING SO GIGANTIC.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.925
WHEN HE WAS A KID,

04:17.958 --> 04:20.027
HE WASN'T ALLOWED
TO PET THE CAT.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.398
COME ON.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.834
HE COULDN'T PET THE CAT.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.736
OH, GOD. YOU'RE NOT OKAY.
YOU'RE NOT.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.738
- I'M FINE, RAY.

04:30.771 --> 04:33.407
- SEE, I WOULD'VE BELIEVED YOU
IF YOU DIDN'T ADD THE "RAY."

04:33.441 --> 04:35.543
LOOK, DO YOU MIND?
I HAVE TO PACK.

04:35.576 --> 04:36.777
I'M LEAVING
WITH THE METS TOMORROW.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.479
- YEAH. GO AHEAD.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.480
IT'S MY BROTHER, RIGHT?

04:39.513 --> 04:41.014
- NO, IT'S--

04:41.048 --> 04:43.584
- IT'S MY FATHER.
YES, HE'S REALLY ANNOYING.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.786
- [sighs]
NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FATHER.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.321
- IT'S MY MOM, RIGHT?

04:47.355 --> 04:49.690
YEAH, YEAH.
SHE BROKE OUR KNIFE.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.526
LET'S KILL HER.

04:52.560 --> 04:55.563
COME ON, YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING
WE DON'T DO THINGS TOGETHER.

04:58.966 --> 05:01.735
WE'LL KILL HER
AND THEN A MOVIE.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.839
I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID.

05:05.873 --> 05:08.642
I'M USUALLY GOOD
AT KNOWING WHEN IT'S ME,

05:08.676 --> 05:12.546
BECAUSE IT'S USUALLY ME.

05:12.580 --> 05:17.017
- RAY, HOW COME YOU CAN NEVER
JUST BE AFFECTIONATE WITH ME?

05:17.050 --> 05:19.820
- OH, BERNIE!

05:19.853 --> 05:21.622
- DID YOU SEE
HOW BERNIE IS WITH LINDA?

05:21.655 --> 05:25.459
- I SEE. EVERYBODY SEES THAT.
IT'S FREE PLAYBOY CHANNEL!

05:25.493 --> 05:27.961
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH IT
ONCE IN A WHILE.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.398
- HE WAS DRINKING.

05:30.431 --> 05:31.599
- THEY'RE SO PASSIONATE.

05:31.632 --> 05:35.569
- THEY'RE DRUNKS!
BOTH OF THEM!

05:35.603 --> 05:37.438
LOOK--

05:37.471 --> 05:40.874
LOOK, THEY'VE ONLY BEEN MARRIED
FOR, WHAT, TWO YEARS?

05:40.908 --> 05:43.444
SO THERE'S NO KIDS,
NO EXHAUSTION.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.478
JUST WAIT.

05:44.512 --> 05:45.479
- WAIT FOR WHAT?

05:45.513 --> 05:47.715
- FOR THIS.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.684
THE NOISE AND THE NO SLEEP
AND THE NO TIME.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.952
PLEASE, KNOW WHAT
I MEAN HERE.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.888
- YOU NEVER EVEN SAY
"I LOVE YOU."

05:54.922 --> 05:56.490
- OH, NOW I DON'T LOVE YOU.

05:56.524 --> 05:57.491
- YOU DON'T SAY IT.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.492
- I DO.
- NO, YOU DON'T.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.527
- I DO.
- WHEN DO YOU SAY IT?

05:59.560 --> 06:01.429
- WITH MY EYES!

06:05.198 --> 06:07.134
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:07.167 --> 06:08.869
- I'M--

06:08.902 --> 06:11.839
DROWNING.

06:11.872 --> 06:12.906
LOOK, YOU WANT ME
TO SAY IT?

06:12.940 --> 06:14.442
I LOVE YOU.
THERE. I SAID IT.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.777
- OH, YEAH, OKAY,
THERE'S THE SEVEN LITTLE WORDS

06:16.810 --> 06:18.111
EVERY WOMAN
WANTS TO HEAR.

06:18.145 --> 06:21.449
I LOVE YOU.
THERE. I SAID IT.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.916
- HEY, COME ON.
DON'T I SAY IT WHEN WE--

06:22.950 --> 06:26.587
- OH, YELLING IT DURING SEX
DOESN'T COUNT.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.123
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT.
I DON'T KNOW.

06:30.157 --> 06:33.494
- WELL--
- WHAT?

06:33.527 --> 06:34.194
- I DON'T KNOW.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.896
JUST--

06:38.732 --> 06:40.167
WELL, I--

06:40.200 --> 06:41.835
DOESN'T MATTER.
JUST--

06:43.771 --> 06:44.872
GOOD NIGHT.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.109
- UM--

06:49.142 --> 06:50.878
I'M STILL PACKING
OVER HERE.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.686
- GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.721

07:05.926 --> 07:07.961
- WHAT IS THIS?
A CARD?

07:07.995 --> 07:10.498
- MM-HMM.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.233
GOT UP EARLY
TO GET IT FOR YOU.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.735
- WHY?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.904
- YOU KNOW.
'CAUSE OF WHAT WE--

07:16.937 --> 07:19.006
YOU KNOW.

07:19.039 --> 07:21.609
- "TO A SPECIAL WIFE."

07:24.277 --> 07:26.580
"LOVE LIKE OURS
IS REAL AND TRUE

07:26.614 --> 07:29.116
"AS A LILY HOLDS
THE MORNING DEW.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.819
"EVER DAY
FINDS JOY ANEW,

07:31.852 --> 07:35.122
AND IN EVERY WAY
DO I LOVE YOU."

07:36.857 --> 07:38.058
- AHH.
- YEAH!

07:38.091 --> 07:40.594
HA, HA, HA!

07:40.628 --> 07:42.863
OH, THAT'S REALLY SWEET, RAY.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.034
- YEAH?
- YEAH. I JUST--

07:47.067 --> 07:48.736
LOVE IT.
IT'S--

07:48.769 --> 07:50.538
IT'S A REALLY NICE CARD.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.740
- OH, SOMETHING'S WRONG.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.142
WHAT, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

07:55.175 --> 07:59.279
OH, I SHOULD'VE GOT
THE POP-UP.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.750
- MAYBE YOU JUST DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND WHAT I MEANT.

08:02.783 --> 08:05.285
- OH, YOU STILL WANT
THE TALKING.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.755
LOOK, THIS IS BETTER
THAN TALKING.

08:07.788 --> 08:08.856
THIS IS WRITING.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.891
- UH-HUH.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.893
YOU COULDN'T EVEN
SIGN IT "LOVE, RAY."

08:12.926 --> 08:14.895
YOU SIGNED IT,
"OKAY? RAY."

08:16.196 --> 08:17.097
- LOOK, YOU KNOW ME.

08:17.130 --> 08:21.101
YOU KNOW THIS ALL
MAKES ME UNCOMFORTABLE.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.637
WHEN I SAY I LOVE YOU,
IT DOESN'T SOUND NATURAL.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.706
IT'S LIKE SOME BAD MOVIE,

08:25.739 --> 08:27.174
LIKE SOMEBODY'S
GOING TO LAUGH AT ME.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.742
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
LAUGH?

08:28.776 --> 08:30.978
- SOMEBODY'S GOING TO LAUGH
AT ME SAYING THAT STUFF.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.946
- STUFF?

08:32.980 --> 08:35.182
- DO YOU LOVE ME, DADDY?

08:35.215 --> 08:38.919
- OH, YES!
OF COURSE I LOVE YOU!

08:38.952 --> 08:40.621
I LOVE ALL YOU GUYS.

08:40.654 --> 08:41.789
AND MOMMY.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.724
HUH?
WHAT A MOMMY.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.793
WHAT A--
LET'S HEAR IT FOR MOMMY!

08:45.826 --> 08:49.329
RAISE YOUR HAND FOR--
YAY!

08:49.362 --> 08:50.931
LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST--

08:50.964 --> 08:52.833
I'M NOT GOOD
AT SAYING THAT STUFF ALOUD.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.034
THAT'S THE WAY I AM.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.603
THAT'S THE WAY
MY PARENTS WERE.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.770
- WELL, OKAY,
BUT YOU KNOW,

08:56.804 --> 08:58.639
MAYBE THERE WAS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH THAT.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.840
I MEAN, COME ON.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.043
YOU WANT TO PASS THIS TRAIT
ON TO YOUR KIDS?

09:03.076 --> 09:04.177
- NO.

09:06.213 --> 09:07.748
- RAY--

09:10.083 --> 09:12.653
I LOVE YOU.

09:15.823 --> 09:16.924
- AND I YOU.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.759
- OH!

09:18.792 --> 09:19.860
- COME ON!

09:21.194 --> 09:23.764
COME ON.
IT'S ALL HERE IN THE CARD!

09:23.797 --> 09:26.934
DEBRA.
DEBRA!

09:26.967 --> 09:28.736
- STELLA!

09:40.047 --> 09:42.950
- STUPID STINKING HUMP!

09:42.983 --> 09:45.886
DON'T TOY WITH ME, GOD.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.187
- HEY, DAD, ICED TEA?

09:47.220 --> 09:50.991
- NO. IT GETS ME
ALL HOPPED UP.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.826
I'M ALMOST DONE HERE.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.695
OW!

09:54.728 --> 09:57.397
DAMN PIECE
OF CRAP!

09:57.430 --> 09:59.733
- PLEASE, DAD,
TAKE IT EASY A LITTLE.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.001
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING?

10:01.034 --> 10:03.336
- YEAH, SURE, YOU DO,
BUT RELAX.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.205
- GIVE ME
THE DAMN PLIERS.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.276
THANKS.

10:09.309 --> 10:12.713
- LISTEN, DAD,
I GOT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.015
- THERE!
DONE!

10:15.048 --> 10:16.750
A COUPLE OF THINGS
YOU GOT TO REMEMBER.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.752
IT'S VERY EASY, OKAY.
- YEAH? LIKE WHAT?

10:18.786 --> 10:22.122
- WELL, IT'S NOTHING.
HOT IS NOW COLD.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.257
- WHAT ELSE?
IS THE WATER GOING TO COME OUT?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.759
- SURE.
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.661
YOU HOLD
ON TO THIS ONE TIGHT,

10:27.695 --> 10:30.330
AND THEN YOU PUSH
AND TURN WITH THIS ONE.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.232
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
AT LEAST TWO HANDS.

10:32.265 --> 10:33.801
- YEAH, DAD, PLEASE--

10:33.834 --> 10:36.136
- AAH!

10:36.169 --> 10:38.338
THE WATER COMES OUT
VERY HOT AT FIRST,

10:38.371 --> 10:39.439
BUT SAVE THAT.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.408
YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED IT LATER.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.711
- AW, DAD, SHUT IT.
JUST SHUT IT.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.913
- HERE, GIVE ME A HAND.
GIVE ME A HAND.

10:45.946 --> 10:47.047
- [groaning]

10:47.080 --> 10:48.248
- TURN.
TURN IT!

10:48.281 --> 10:49.817
- I'M TURNING.
- TURN IT!

10:49.850 --> 10:51.919
- I'M TURNING IT!

10:51.952 --> 10:53.120
- WHEW!

10:53.153 --> 10:56.423
- THANKS.

10:56.456 --> 11:01.394
LISTEN, DAD,
I WAS WONDERING SOMETHING.

11:05.032 --> 11:08.335
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

11:08.368 --> 11:12.139
THAT YOU SAID
"I LOVE YOU" TO--

11:12.172 --> 11:15.008
ANYBODY?

11:15.042 --> 11:17.110
- "I LOVE YOU"?

11:17.144 --> 11:19.412
- YEAH.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.181
- WHAT, DO YOU LIVE
IN A FREAKIN' FAIRYLAND

11:21.214 --> 11:22.850
OR SOMETHING?

11:24.451 --> 11:25.953
- DAD, I JUST
WANTED TO KNOW.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.487
- THIS IS REAL LIFE,
RAYMOND.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.823
PEOPLE DON'T JUST
GO AROUND SAYING THAT.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.424
- YES, THEY DO, DAD.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.293
- NAME ONE.
NAME ONE PERSON.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.797
- DEBRA.
- THAT'S AN ACT.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.366
- IT'S NOT AN ACT, DAD.
SHE MEANS IT.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.734
- ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
COME ON.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.770
MAYBE DEBRA.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.906
BUT SHE'S, UH, NICE.

11:45.939 --> 11:47.474
WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME
THESE THINGS?

11:47.507 --> 11:49.176
- I JUST WANT TO KNOW.
THAT'S ALL.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.011
DO YOU EVER SAY IT
TO MOM?

11:51.044 --> 11:53.146
- YOU'RE GETTING
KIND OF PERSONAL NOW.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.782
- DAD, YOU'RE MY FATHER.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.784
- YOUR MOTHER AND I
KNOW HOW WE FEEL.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.218
THAT'S OUR BUSINESS.

11:58.251 --> 12:02.489
- WHAT?
HELLO, RAYMOND, SWEETIE.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.791
HOW YOU--

12:03.824 --> 12:05.826
WHAT'S OUR BUSINESS?

12:05.859 --> 12:08.061
- NOTHING.
MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.797
- YOU SAID OUR BUSINESS.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.031
WHAT ARE YOU TWO
TALKING ABOUT?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.432
- NOTHING, MA.
IT'S OKAY.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.801
- YOU GOT HIM LYING
FOR YOU NOW?

12:13.834 --> 12:16.136
- GO AWAY!

12:16.169 --> 12:20.073
- I CHOP UP CELERY AND DILL
FOR YOUR ROTTEN TUNA SANDWICH

12:20.107 --> 12:21.842
AND I DRAG IT
ACROSS THE STREET FOR YOU,

12:21.875 --> 12:24.277
AND YOU DON'T
EVEN HAVE THE DECENCY--

12:24.311 --> 12:26.213
- HEY,
THAT'S MY FREAKIN' LUNCH!

12:26.246 --> 12:27.981
- NOW COME ON.
IT'S NOTHING.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.250
I WAS ASKING, THAT'S ALL.
I WAS JUST ASKING,

12:30.283 --> 12:32.519
HOW COME NOBODY EVER SAYS
"I LOVE YOU" AROUND HERE?

12:32.552 --> 12:33.887
BUT I'M STARTING
TO REALIZE

12:33.921 --> 12:35.856
WHAT A STUPID QUESTION
THAT IS.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.491
- NO, THAT'S NOT STUPID
AT ALL, DEAR.

12:38.525 --> 12:39.359
THERE HAPPENS TO BE

12:39.392 --> 12:41.995
A VERY GOOD EXPLANATION
FOR IT, THOUGH.

12:42.029 --> 12:44.497
YOUR FATHER DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT LOVE IS.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.366
- OKAY. OH, BOY.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.335
- WHEN WE FIRST
WERE MARRIED,

12:48.368 --> 12:50.237
I SAID IT
ALL THE TIME.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.205
- NAME ONE TIME.
- ALL THE TIME.

12:52.239 --> 12:53.273
- WHEN?
WHEN DID YOU SAY IT?

12:53.306 --> 12:55.375
- I SAID IT
ALL THE TIME!

12:57.210 --> 13:00.280
I HAPPEN TO BE
A VERY LOVING, CARING WOMAN.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.882
YOU KNOW THAT, RAYMOND.

13:01.915 --> 13:04.117
BUT I MEAN, AFTER YEARS
AND YEARS OF GIVING AND SHARING

13:04.151 --> 13:07.054
AND GETTING NOTHING IN RETURN,
ONE TENDS TO--

13:07.087 --> 13:08.956
- YOU SAID IT
ONE TIME IN ALBANY.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.457
- OH, SHUT UP.
- ONE TIME!

13:10.490 --> 13:11.524
- SHUT UP!

13:11.558 --> 13:13.193
- THE NIGHT YOU HAD
THE RUM CANDY.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.862
- SHUT UP, FRANK!

13:14.895 --> 13:16.196
SEE WHAT I HAVE
TO PUT UP WITH?

13:16.229 --> 13:17.831
- LOOK, MA, DAD,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY IT.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.266
IT'S OKAY.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.835
- WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT TO YOU,
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

13:21.869 --> 13:25.172
MY PARENTS NEVER SAID IT.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.606
- WHEN YOU WERE A KID,
DIDN'T YOU WANT

13:26.639 --> 13:28.175
YOUR MOTHER AND FATHER
TO SAY IT TO YOU?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.176
- OF COURSE.

13:29.209 --> 13:29.977
- BUT THEY DIDN'T.

13:30.010 --> 13:30.743
- WHY?

13:33.246 --> 13:34.882
- THEY DIDN'T
WANT TO SPOIL US.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.851
- ALL RIGHT, THIS IS THE WAY
WE WANT TO BE?

13:37.885 --> 13:40.120
IS THIS THE WAY
WE WANT THE KIDS TO BE?

13:40.153 --> 13:42.055
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD BE SO WRONG
WITH SAYING "I LOVE YOU"

13:42.089 --> 13:45.125
AROUND HERE
ONCE IN A WHILE?

13:45.158 --> 13:49.529
- WELL, WE'RE NOT LIVING
IN A FAIRYLAND HERE, RAYMOND.

13:55.102 --> 13:57.104
- HEY, HOT AND SOUR SOUP!

13:57.137 --> 13:58.638
- WANT TO GIVE ME A HAND
WITH THESE GUYS?

13:58.671 --> 14:02.275
- COME ON, GUYS.
IT'S FUN IN THE SINK.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.276
YOU LOVE IT,
DON'T YOU?

14:03.310 --> 14:06.546
LOOK AT THAT.
LOOK HOW THE GREASE SEPARATES.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.616
ALL SQUEAKY
AND SHINY CLEAN.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.651
HEY, I CAN SEE MYSELF.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.354
- YEAH, YOU SHOULD BE
LOOKING A LITTLE LOWER.

14:15.622 --> 14:19.426
- HEY, THIS DISH
HAS A CRACK IN IT.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.161
COME ON.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.530
ALL RIGHT,
LOOK, YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:23.563 --> 14:26.233
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.236
I'LL TRY AND CHANGE
THE WAY I AM OR SOMETHING.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.171
- YOU MEAN THAT?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.473
- WE'RE LEAVING NOW.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.008
- OKAY.
THANKS.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.476
THANKS, DAD.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.411
- THE SHOWER'S FIXED,

14:38.445 --> 14:40.981
AND THERE'S JUST ONE THING
I WANT YOU TO KNOW.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.249
- WHAT?

14:42.282 --> 14:45.318
- WELL, UH, WE'VE
BEEN TALKING, AND, UH--

14:45.352 --> 14:46.319
YOU GO AHEAD, FRANK.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.387
- I LOVE YOU.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.489
- I LOVE YOU!

14:49.522 --> 14:51.458
- OH, GOD, MOM.

14:51.491 --> 14:52.993
- I LOVE YOU, DEBRA.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.594
- MOM, YOU CAN STOP, MOM.

14:54.627 --> 14:57.597
MOM, YOU'RE SCARING THEM.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.533
GO.
SAVE THE CHILDREN.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.103
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.038
IT'S OKAY.

15:05.072 --> 15:06.039
- HEY.

15:06.073 --> 15:09.276
- OH, ROBBIE,
SWEETHEART.

15:09.309 --> 15:10.277
I LOVE YOU.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.045
I'M SO SORRY.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.213
- SORRY FOR WHAT?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.247
- FOR NEVER SAYING IT.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.448
FROM NOW ON,

15:15.482 --> 15:16.716
I'M GOING TO SAY IT TO YOU
ALL THE TIME.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.086
ALL OF YOU,
EVEN FRANK.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.954
I LOVE YOU!

15:24.124 --> 15:25.425
- ISN'T THIS THE PART
OF THE MOVIE

15:25.458 --> 15:27.527
WHERE SHE'S SUPPOSED
TO GET SHOT BY THE REAL HER?

15:30.763 --> 15:33.000
- WELL, WE'RE HERE
FOR SUCH A SHORT WHILE.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.402
YOUR FAMILY SHOULD KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL.

15:35.435 --> 15:39.272
- I'M FEELING IT'S NOT
THAT SHORT A WHILE HERE, MA.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.207
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,

15:40.240 --> 15:44.177
I FELT KIND OF EMBARRASSED
AT FIRST TOO.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.745
BUT NOW--

15:45.778 --> 15:47.647
- OH, GOD.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.516
AW.

15:49.549 --> 15:51.118
- I LOVE YOU, SON.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.286
- ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, DAD. ME TOO.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.621
I'LL BE OVER HERE.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.458
WHAT?

15:58.491 --> 16:01.494
- WELL, YOU'RE MY BROTHER.

16:01.528 --> 16:02.762
I LOVE YOU, RAYMOND.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.098
- OH, ISN'T THAT NICE?

16:07.067 --> 16:09.136
- COME ON. ENOUGH.
ENOUGH ALREADY!

16:09.169 --> 16:10.570
OH, GOD!

16:10.603 --> 16:13.240
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.642
- I TOLD THEM
WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.344
- WHAT? WHY?

16:17.377 --> 16:20.113
- I THOUGHT I COULD FIND OUT
WHY I WAS THE WAY I WAS.

16:20.147 --> 16:23.483
BUT NOW I KNOW WHY.
I'M FROM A MENTAL INSTITUTION.

16:25.585 --> 16:26.686
- I LOVE YOU, DEB.

16:26.719 --> 16:28.455
- ROBERT, ROBERT.
- NO, NO.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.657
- YOU'RE--

16:30.690 --> 16:32.092
REMEMBER THE CAT.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.039
- THANKS, ROB,
I--I LOVE YOU TOO.

16:46.073 --> 16:49.409
RAY, THIS IS NOT
WHAT I WANTED.

16:49.442 --> 16:52.479
UH, COULD EVERYBODY JUST--
GO BACK TO NORMAL?

16:52.512 --> 16:53.280
I THINK IT WAS
MUCH BETTER

16:53.313 --> 16:55.782
BEFORE EVERYBODY
LOVED EACH OTHER.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.585
- WAIT A MINUTE.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.720
THIS IS BETWEEN YOU TWO.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.389
THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.357
- WELL, YEAH, YEAH,
I WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT

17:04.391 --> 17:07.427
WHY I'M NOT THE MOST
DEMONSTRATIVE GUY.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.228
AND I THOUGHT--

17:08.261 --> 17:10.463
- YOU THOUGHT
IT WAS OUR FAULT.

17:10.497 --> 17:13.300
- THAT'S TYPICAL.
YOU BLAME THE PARENTS.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.601
THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM,

17:14.634 --> 17:15.768
AND THE FIRST THING
KIDS DO TODAY

17:15.802 --> 17:17.170
IS POINT
TO THE MOTHER.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.771
- NOBODY'S POINTING, MA.

17:18.805 --> 17:22.375
- IF IT'S ANYBODY'S FAULT,
IT'S YOUR FATHER.

17:22.409 --> 17:25.612
- OKAY, PLEASE,
JUST STOP.

17:25.645 --> 17:27.480
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.817
WHY DO YOU DEAL WITH IMPORTANT
THINGS WE TALK ABOUT LIKE THIS?

17:30.850 --> 17:33.120
I'M SORRY
I EVER BRING THEM UP.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.822
- I'M SORRY TOO.

17:35.855 --> 17:36.823
- I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING, RAY.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.126
I WILL NEVER BOTHER YOU
ON THIS SUBJECT AGAIN.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.327
I PROMISE, OKAY?

17:40.360 --> 17:42.162
LET'S JUST FORGET
I EVER SAID ANYTHING.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.730
ALL RIGHT?

17:43.763 --> 17:44.831
- COME ON, DEB.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.366
DEB.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.834
- YOU KNOW,
YOUR PLANE LEAVES IN TWO HOURS.

17:47.867 --> 17:49.269
YOU HAVEN'T
EVEN PACKED YET.

17:49.302 --> 17:53.340
- OH, GOD.
LOOK, I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.

17:53.373 --> 17:56.643
I'M SORRY
I'M SUCH A SCREW-UP.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.785
- [clears throat]

18:10.823 --> 18:12.659
- THIS LOVE STUFF--

18:12.692 --> 18:14.827
WE NEVER MENTION IT AGAIN.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.615
- OH, HI.
- HI.

19:08.648 --> 19:11.851
- I MADE THE BED.
- YEAH, I SEE.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.523
- LISTEN--
- UH, DON'T.

19:16.556 --> 19:17.757
- WHAT?

19:17.790 --> 19:19.726
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SAY ANYTHING.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.501
- I DON'T?
- NOPE.

19:34.874 --> 19:37.344
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

19:37.377 --> 19:38.678
- I'M GOING
TO MISS MY PLANE.

19:38.711 --> 19:39.979
- OKAY.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.514
- I'LL CALL YOU.
- OKAY.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.550
- I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I GET THERE.

19:43.583 --> 19:44.617
- ALL RIGHT.

19:44.651 --> 19:45.685
BYE.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.434
- I LOVE YOU.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.473
- [laughing]

20:06.506 --> 20:07.907
- OH, BEAUTIFUL.
BEAUTIFUL.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.243
- HONEY, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.

20:10.277 --> 20:13.380
- NO, THAT'S ALL, CARDS--
ONLY CARDS FROM NOW ON.

20:13.413 --> 20:16.949
YEAH, YOUR "I LOVE YOU"
IS GOING TO COME FROM ZIGGY.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.995
YEAH, I MISS YOU, TOO.

20:29.028 --> 20:31.364
OKAY,
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.400
AND, HONEY--

20:33.433 --> 20:35.502
I LOVE YOU.

20:35.535 --> 20:36.936
GOOD. WELL,
GET USED TO IT,

20:36.969 --> 20:39.906
