WEBVTT

00:47.924 --> 00:49.800
Auntie Janet?

00:51.677 --> 00:55.097
It's time, auntie Janet. He's waiting.

01:06.025 --> 01:08.861
We should hurry. We have papers to sign.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.911
Just tell me when.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.831
Don't you cry for me, dear.

01:20.915 --> 01:23.209
I'm tired of the pain.

01:44.897 --> 01:47.400
You're my angel of mercy.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.282
Is she gone?

01:57.702 --> 02:00.037
Something's wrong here.

02:06.711 --> 02:08.713
(Screaming)

02:49.754 --> 02:51.756
(Violin music)

02:57.970 --> 02:59.972
(Knock on door)

03:03.517 --> 03:04.894
(Speaks Russian)

03:04.977 --> 03:06.979
(Man) Vassin peskow?

03:55.319 --> 03:57.279
(Man) Prisoner. Hey!

04:00.199 --> 04:02.451
Phsoner

04:19.427 --> 04:22.221
I thought maybe you were dead.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.978
How long have I been lying here?

04:29.061 --> 04:31.856
Hours. I don't know.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.442
The first time is bad. Very bad.

04:39.905 --> 04:42.825
- They've done this to you?
- Yes.

04:42.908 --> 04:46.287
It becomes easier each time,
until it kills you.

04:47.288 --> 04:48.789
What did they do to me?

04:48.873 --> 04:52.084
You have been exposed to the black cancer.

04:53.169 --> 04:56.505
- What cancer?
- The cancer that lives in the rock.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.720
Who are you?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.222
I was a geologist.

05:06.140 --> 05:09.435
Quite well known in my field, actually...

05:09.518 --> 05:12.521
But now I am just a test subject.

05:13.439 --> 05:15.191
You helped them find the rock?

05:15.274 --> 05:18.611
I was there when they brought up
the first fragments.

05:18.694 --> 05:21.447
This was before the mining.

05:21.530 --> 05:24.617
Before we knew what lived
in tunguska rock.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.914
How many men have died here?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.291
Hundreds. Maybe more.

05:33.918 --> 05:36.629
The search for a cure goes slowly.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.257
Is that what they say the tests are for,
to find a cure?

05:40.341 --> 05:43.719
No, no. They tell us nothing.

05:43.802 --> 05:47.806
We are left to guess or imagine
the reasons for our torture.

05:47.890 --> 05:50.351
But what else could it be?

05:50.434 --> 05:53.395
What happened to the man
who was in the cell with me - krycek?

05:53.479 --> 05:57.900
He is most likely dining with the men
responsible for our torture.

05:59.735 --> 06:02.613
I heard laughter when they left your cell.

06:02.696 --> 06:06.742
- I'm not gonna die.
- No? Why not?

06:06.825 --> 06:09.912
I have to live long enough
to kill that man krycek.

06:20.923 --> 06:24.385
- Where'd you get this?
- I made it... to kill myself.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.388
It took me nearly two weeks.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.765
By then I had lost the desire.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.519
You'd rather suffer the torture?

06:34.937 --> 06:39.108
It is wonderful, the persistence of life.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.903
That rock we found buried
so deep in the earth...

06:42.987 --> 06:47.157
That anything could survive
down there against all reason...

06:50.703 --> 06:53.205
They will have to kill me themselves.

06:56.542 --> 07:00.129
(Scully) We haven't been able to give him
anything but fluids for 48 hours.

07:00.212 --> 07:04.049
(Man) It doesn't help that
he's in a restricted environment.

07:04.133 --> 07:09.763
Well, if he has been infected by some kind
of organism, we can't risk contamination.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.682
Are you seeing anything?

07:11.765 --> 07:15.185
The blood in the carotid artery
looks slightly thickened...

07:15.269 --> 07:18.606
Possibly due to the decreased
heart rate and blood pressure.

07:18.689 --> 07:20.691
Now what's this?

07:21.692 --> 07:24.111
What the hell is this?

07:24.194 --> 07:25.404
What is it?

07:25.487 --> 07:30.034
I don't know. It looks like
it's concentrated around his pineal body.

07:31.827 --> 07:35.039
- I think it's alive!
- (Scully) It looks like a nest.

07:35.122 --> 07:39.918
Some kind of black vermiform organism
attached to the pineal gland.

07:51.221 --> 07:54.224
- Apple?
- No. Thank you very much, though.

08:37.809 --> 08:40.062
- (Gasps)
- Oh, pardon me.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.774
- Who are you?
- As a boy, my father had a farm...

08:44.817 --> 08:46.860
But not horses like these.

08:51.407 --> 08:54.284
My name is vassily peskow.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.954
Mr peskow...

08:57.037 --> 08:59.581
I'm sorry, but you don't belong in here.

08:59.665 --> 09:01.917
I am sorry, very sorry.

09:02.584 --> 09:06.797
You are going to have to leave here.
I'm going to call you a cab.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.050
But I have come here
to see you, dr charne-sayre.

09:12.970 --> 09:17.808
- Do I know you?
- No. I don't know how you could.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.687
(Horses neighing)

09:32.990 --> 09:34.700
Agent Scully.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.703
- Sir, what...?
- I've been trying to contact you for hours.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.873
- The better part of a day!
- My cell phone was turned off.

09:40.956 --> 09:45.210
You owe me some answers - answers I don't
have to the questions I'm being asked...

09:45.294 --> 09:47.379
About this missing diplomatic pouch.

09:47.463 --> 09:51.175
The pouch presumably carried by the man
who was pushed off my balcony...

09:51.258 --> 09:54.970
And whose connection to
the known felon I harboured in my house...

09:55.053 --> 09:59.141
I'll have to explain to avoid perjuring
myself before a senate subcommittee.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.853
Which is a serious crime in itself,
is it not, agent Scully?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.105
Yes, sir. Sir, if I might explain.

10:06.398 --> 10:12.196
The contents of that pouch - it contained
some kind of a biohazardous organism...

10:12.279 --> 10:15.783
That is in a contamination laboratory
at NASA Goddard...

10:15.866 --> 10:19.119
Which is where I've been,
trying to determine its exact nature.

10:19.203 --> 10:22.581
That pouch, do you know
what its intended destination was?

10:22.664 --> 10:25.042
- No, sir, I don't.
- Well, I do, agent Scully...

10:25.125 --> 10:29.171
Because I bent some rules this morning
to find out who was to receive it.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.965
- Who was it?
- Dr bonita charne-sayre.

10:32.633 --> 10:36.470
- Are you familiar with that name?
- Yes, sir. She's a well-known physician.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.598
A virologist who's looked in on presidents.

10:39.681 --> 10:44.144
She's also an authority on...
On variola viruses.

10:44.228 --> 10:47.564
- Variola?
- Smallpox. She's been a vocal proponent...

10:47.648 --> 10:52.110
Of eliminating the last remaining stores
of the smallpox virus...

10:52.194 --> 10:56.949
Destroying the only remaining vials here
in Atlanta and in the former Soviet union.

10:57.032 --> 10:59.243
- Well, she was killed tonight.
- Killed?

10:59.326 --> 11:03.288
A horse stepped on her throat
in a riding accident in Virginia.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.708
(Door unlocking)

11:07.292 --> 11:09.294
(Footsteps approaching)

11:09.378 --> 11:11.797
(Man speaking Russian)

11:12.214 --> 11:14.967
- Where are we going?
- (Speaks Russian)

12:08.103 --> 12:11.690
Prisoner... is that your friend?

12:21.617 --> 12:23.994
You have but one chance.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.079
(Speaks Russian)

12:45.265 --> 12:47.267
(Man yelling)

12:57.653 --> 12:59.029
( Yelling)

15:14.748 --> 15:18.043
That's a nasty habit.
It's bad for the health.

15:26.009 --> 15:29.513
Health is the least of my concerns
at the moment.

15:29.596 --> 15:30.597
Yes.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.353
According to reports, your...

15:38.021 --> 15:43.276
Personal physician suffered a serious
riding accident here on your property.

15:43.401 --> 15:46.071
Dr charne-sayre was murdered.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.281
By whom?

15:48.406 --> 15:51.284
If I knew, do you think
I'd be standing here talking to you?

15:53.078 --> 15:55.580
You need me now.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.125
A man of my capabilities, is that it?

15:59.126 --> 16:01.753
This was a professional hit.

16:01.878 --> 16:05.882
Really? And you out here
all alone and so vulnerable.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.972
Were you sleeping with her?

16:14.641 --> 16:17.936
Surely you wouldn't be so foolish
as to put the project at risk...

16:18.061 --> 16:21.106
For the sake of your personal pleasures.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.275
Find her killer.

16:23.400 --> 16:27.487
- Call off this congressional investigation.
- I can't.

16:27.612 --> 16:31.241
But senator Sorenson
is an honourable man.

16:32.284 --> 16:34.411
They are all honourable...

16:34.494 --> 16:37.122
These honourable men.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.507
I heard mulder was captured in tunguska.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.930
I hear now he's escaped.

16:57.184 --> 17:00.937
Wake the Russian bear,
and it may find we've stolen its honey.

17:15.660 --> 17:18.079
(Horses neighing)

17:18.163 --> 17:20.165
(Men speaking Russian)

17:43.021 --> 17:45.023
(Groaning)

17:46.650 --> 17:48.526
(Running footsteps)

18:06.878 --> 18:08.880
(Speaking Russian)

18:27.065 --> 18:28.066
I'm sorry.

19:11.609 --> 19:13.528
I, Dana Katherine Scully...

19:13.611 --> 19:16.323
Swear to tell the
truth, the whole truth...

19:16.448 --> 19:19.534
And nothing but the
truth, so help me, god.

19:19.617 --> 19:20.827
(Gavel pounds)

19:20.910 --> 19:23.705
I would like to read
from a prepared statement.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.707
You may do so.

19:25.790 --> 19:30.712
"I left behind a career in medicine
to become an FBI agent four years ago...

19:30.795 --> 19:33.256
Because I believed in this country."

19:33.340 --> 19:39.220
"I wanted to uphold its laws, to punish
the guilty and to protect the innocent."

19:39.304 --> 19:41.765
"I still believe in this country."

19:41.848 --> 19:45.226
"But I believe there are powerful men
in this government who do not."

19:45.310 --> 19:49.230
"Men who have no respect for the law
and who flout it with impunity."

19:49.314 --> 19:50.106
Ms Scully...

19:50.190 --> 19:53.610
"I have come to the conclusion
that it is no longer possible..."

19:53.693 --> 19:59.324
This is not a soapbox, ms Scully. Your
statement will be entered into the record.

19:59.449 --> 20:01.659
With respect, I would like to finish.

20:01.785 --> 20:05.246
- This is not why we are here today.
- Then why are we here, sir?

20:05.330 --> 20:09.501
Do you or do you not know
the whereabouts of agent mulder?

20:11.544 --> 20:15.965
Are you or are you not aware
of agent mulder's present location?

20:16.049 --> 20:18.927
I respectfully refuse
to answer that question, sir.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.971
Agent Scully, you cannot refuse
to answer that question.

20:22.055 --> 20:25.225
I believe answering that question
could endanger agent mulder's life.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.477
You don't seem to understand.

20:27.560 --> 20:31.064
Your response is not optional.
You are an agent of the FBI.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.316
Then if I may please finish my statement.

20:33.400 --> 20:37.821
"That it is no longer possible for me
to carry out my duties as an FBI agent."

20:37.904 --> 20:43.201
Are you tendering your resignation, agent
Scully? Is that what you're trying to say?

20:43.326 --> 20:45.328
No, sir.

20:46.413 --> 20:51.459
What I am saying is that
there is a culture of lawlessness...

20:51.543 --> 20:54.170
That has prevented me from doing my job.

20:54.254 --> 20:57.048
That the real target
of this investigation...

20:57.173 --> 21:00.510
Should be the men who are beyond
prosecution and punishment.

21:00.593 --> 21:04.848
The men whose secret policies are behind
the crimes that you are investigating.

21:04.931 --> 21:09.978
You have a legal obligation
to answer the questions posed to you.

21:10.061 --> 21:13.523
Tell us what you know
about agent mulder's whereabouts...

21:13.606 --> 21:16.693
Or you'll be held in
contempt of congress.

21:19.070 --> 21:21.072
(Buzzer)

22:06.451 --> 22:08.453
(Speaks Russian)

22:35.480 --> 22:37.106
(Speaks Russian)

22:42.153 --> 22:44.197
- No Russian.
- American?

22:46.282 --> 22:49.118
Tell your husband I'm
sorry about his truck.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.704
The test?

22:51.829 --> 22:53.873
Yeah.

22:53.998 --> 22:57.544
- They kill everybody for the test.
- Why don't they kill you?

22:57.669 --> 23:01.839
My husband makes deliveries.
They spare our lives.

23:01.965 --> 23:04.467
But now, no truck. He is afraid.

23:07.637 --> 23:10.306
- Well, I have to go now.
- No.

23:10.390 --> 23:13.184
- They'll come looking for me, and for you.
- No!

23:13.309 --> 23:17.480
- There are other ways.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

23:18.147 --> 23:20.149
Grisha!

23:23.570 --> 23:26.364
No arm... no test.

23:27.240 --> 23:31.035
You don't understand. These tests,
this smallpox scar on your arm...

23:31.160 --> 23:33.580
It's some kind of identification.

23:33.705 --> 23:36.416
You have to help me escape.
I'll help you escape.

23:36.541 --> 23:39.544
You have to help me get to st Petersburg.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.338
(Heavy footsteps)

23:43.047 --> 23:44.549
(Door opens)

24:08.906 --> 24:10.908
(Man speaking Russian)

24:24.297 --> 24:26.090
(Screaming)

24:59.374 --> 25:02.752
- You holding up?
- I've got plenty to read.

25:08.049 --> 25:11.552
I can understand you
protecting agent mulder, but...

25:11.636 --> 25:14.722
It is not just agent mulder
that I am protecting, sir.

25:14.806 --> 25:16.182
Then what are you doing?

25:16.265 --> 25:20.103
We were called before this committee
to answer questions about a murder...

25:20.186 --> 25:23.022
About an intercepted diplomatic pouch

25:23.106 --> 25:25.566
that was to be delivered
to a prominent doctor...

25:25.650 --> 25:29.904
A woman who is now dead, as is the man
who was delivering the said pouch...

25:29.987 --> 25:35.827
The contents of which have infected
an exobiologist with a paralysing toxin.

25:36.869 --> 25:40.081
Yet what are we stuck on here?

25:40.164 --> 25:44.043
- The whereabouts of agent mulder.
- You mean it's the wrong question.

25:44.127 --> 25:47.088
Several of the men
on this committee are lawyers.

25:47.171 --> 25:50.425
It is my experience that
lawyers ask the wrong question...

25:50.508 --> 25:52.385
When they don't want the right answer.

25:52.468 --> 25:55.847
Unless agent mulder has found
the answers they're looking for.

25:55.930 --> 25:58.516
Or someone wants to make sure
he doesn't find them.

25:58.599 --> 26:01.102
These are congressmen we're talking about.

26:01.185 --> 26:05.648
I know that, sir, and it is my
natural inclination to believe...

26:05.732 --> 26:09.902
That they are acting
in the best interest of the truth...

26:09.986 --> 26:13.823
But I am not inclined
to follow my own judgement in this case.

26:13.906 --> 26:17.034
So you're gonna follow agent mulder's.

26:17.118 --> 26:19.120
Is that it?

27:39.367 --> 27:41.285
His name is vassily peskow.

27:41.369 --> 27:44.622
He was a kgb line-x stringer
working out of Moscow centre.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.791
But how could this be?

27:46.874 --> 27:50.253
How could the Russians know
we were working on our own inoculation?

27:50.336 --> 27:52.964
- Six of us knew!
- Dr charne-sayre?

27:54.507 --> 27:57.969
She was trusted. Absolutely.

27:59.762 --> 28:01.764
Then I don't know.

28:02.598 --> 28:05.226
Find this man! Find him!

28:05.768 --> 28:08.020
If my intelligence sources are right...

28:08.104 --> 28:11.399
I think there's someone
who might save us the trouble.

28:21.993 --> 28:23.995
- Mr chairman, may I?
- Carry on.

28:26.330 --> 28:30.293
Miss Scully, you've had a good long time...

28:30.376 --> 28:33.880
To think about the question
that was asked in our last session.

28:33.963 --> 28:38.301
I want to give you the opportunity
to answer that question here today...

28:38.384 --> 28:41.679
So I can help our good chairman here...

28:41.762 --> 28:43.931
To get on with this proceeding.

28:44.348 --> 28:47.226
I can't answer that question, sir.

28:47.310 --> 28:52.315
I'm going to ask you again. Where is
special agent mulder and why is he not here?

28:52.398 --> 28:55.902
I'll answer your questions
about the man carrying the pouch.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.862
- Agent Scully!
- About his murder...

28:57.945 --> 29:02.533
And my opinion about its connection
to the death of dr bonita charne-sayre.

29:02.617 --> 29:04.452
Miss Scully, you'll get your chance...

29:04.535 --> 29:09.040
- Or about the biotoxin within that pouch.
- Answer the question, miss Scully!

29:10.499 --> 29:12.543
(Mulder) What is the question?

29:19.842 --> 29:21.427
(Gavel pounding)

29:21.510 --> 29:24.180
All right, let's come to order.

29:24.263 --> 29:27.016
Agent Scully, do continue.

29:27.099 --> 29:31.520
Yes, sir, if I may,
I would like to finish making my point.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.648
What is your point, miss Scully?

29:34.357 --> 29:38.486
That the death of dr charne-sayre,
given her field of expertise...

29:38.569 --> 29:42.698
Suggests that she knew something
about the toxin, about its origins...

29:42.782 --> 29:45.201
And that knowledge may be linked...

29:45.284 --> 29:50.289
To the murder of the man in assistant
director Skinner's apartment building.

29:53.584 --> 29:54.919
Miss Scully?

29:55.711 --> 29:57.880
Yes, sir.

29:57.964 --> 30:02.051
Ad Skinner has informed me
that there has been an accident related...

30:02.134 --> 30:03.302
An accident?

30:03.386 --> 30:08.224
A doctor infected with the toxin has died
under suspicious circumstances...

30:08.307 --> 30:10.643
Involving a theft of evidence...

30:10.726 --> 30:13.354
Of the contents of the diplomatic pouch.

30:13.437 --> 30:16.440
Well, we've gotten off
to a real fine start here.

30:17.692 --> 30:21.445
I'm going to recess now
until this new matter can be explained...

30:21.529 --> 30:25.157
So we might then begin
moving in a fonnard direction.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.745
Mulder...

30:30.621 --> 30:32.665
I get to put my arms around you.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.667
- Both of 'em.
- When did you get back?

30:34.750 --> 30:37.211
- It's been a long, strange trip.
- Some other time.

30:37.294 --> 30:39.880
There's been enough strangeness here.

30:39.964 --> 30:43.217
I've made several connections
about what this toxin might be.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.345
- So have I.
- Sir, I need your permission...

30:46.429 --> 30:49.098
To book two airfares
to boca raton, Florida.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.350
It shouldn't take more than 12, 15 hours.

30:51.434 --> 30:55.563
But if it does, I need you to stall the
committee tomorrow for the purpose of...

30:55.646 --> 31:00.359
If you explain it to me, agent Scully,
I'm gonna have to explain it to them.

31:00.818 --> 31:06.115
I suggest you do everything in your power
to make it back for tomorrow's session...

31:06.198 --> 31:08.200
Or I can't help you.

31:10.745 --> 31:12.079
Boca raton?

31:12.163 --> 31:13.843
Dr bonita charne-sayre
is a board member...

31:13.914 --> 31:19.587
And chief physician for a chain of elder-care
convalescent hospitals around the country.

31:19.670 --> 31:23.215
Guess what one of her patients
died of in boca raton?

32:02.546 --> 32:04.840
- Yes, what is it?
- Agents mulder and Scully.

32:04.924 --> 32:08.677
We need your permission
to speak with you or any of your patients.

32:08.761 --> 32:10.513
- What about?
- May we come in?

32:10.596 --> 32:12.598
Yes.

32:14.308 --> 32:18.521
- When were these patients last checked?
- An hour ago, at bed check.

32:22.566 --> 32:24.985
- This man's dead.
- What?

32:37.623 --> 32:39.625
Scully!

32:40.584 --> 32:44.547
These people are test subjects.
I think they've been poisoned.

32:46.257 --> 32:48.592
Who gave these patients
their meds tonight?

32:48.676 --> 32:49.969
I did.

32:50.678 --> 32:55.432
Ok, call 911. Tell them you've got
a quarantine of a biohazardous material.

32:55.516 --> 33:01.147
Show us all of the entrances of the hospital.
We've got to seal this building immediately.

33:21.125 --> 33:23.586
I don't understand
what you hope to learn here.

33:23.669 --> 33:27.923
Everything that's happened, every death
we've seen can be traced back to one man.

33:28.007 --> 33:31.218
But according to you, that man
is in Russia or possibly even dead.

33:31.302 --> 33:33.304
Well, he isn't working alone.

33:38.976 --> 33:41.645
Terry Edward mayhew?
Can we talk with you?

33:42.479 --> 33:45.274
Have a little off-the-record chat?

33:45.357 --> 33:47.735
- About?
- Alex krycek.

33:48.986 --> 33:51.280
- Who?
- The man who set you up.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.991
You and the members of your militia.

33:54.074 --> 33:56.076
Name wasn't krycek.

33:59.580 --> 34:02.249
It was arntzen or somethin' like that.

34:02.333 --> 34:06.670
You met him in north Dakota,
salvaging material from a missile silo.

34:06.754 --> 34:10.341
I never been in no missile silo.
I don't know nothin' about that.

34:10.424 --> 34:12.927
This man krycek,
or "arntzen," as you call him,

34:13.010 --> 34:15.638
how did he come into contact with you?

34:15.721 --> 34:18.139
Off the record.

34:18.224 --> 34:22.353
He came to us with some
building materials and some big ideas.

34:22.436 --> 34:24.855
- What was he looking to build?
- Two...

34:26.607 --> 34:28.317
Devices.

34:28.400 --> 34:31.612
- Did he ever mention black cancer?
- Oh, yeah.

34:33.112 --> 34:36.699
- What did he say?
- Developed by the Soviets.

34:36.784 --> 34:38.494
Saddam used it in the Gulf.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.705
You mean... used as biowarfare?

34:41.789 --> 34:45.376
That's why they made
those servicemen take all them pills.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.670
Us government knew
about the black cancer.

34:48.754 --> 34:52.424
They lied. Didn't have no cure,
no inoculation.

34:56.387 --> 35:00.266
I think we'll quit right there.
I got nothin' more to say.

35:02.434 --> 35:06.230
- Let's go, mulder.
- You said there were... two devices.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.607
What happened to the other bomb?

35:10.317 --> 35:11.944
I ate it.

35:12.069 --> 35:14.780
- Mulder!
- You wanna know about anarchy?

35:14.905 --> 35:19.118
You don't tell me where that other bomb is,
I'll make sure you spend your prison time...

35:19.243 --> 35:21.537
Putting a big smile
on some convict's face.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.914
Son of a bitch stole it, truck and all.

35:23.998 --> 35:26.542
- Some storage garage.
- Where?

35:26.625 --> 35:28.627
Terma, north Dakota.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.880
Thank you.

35:31.964 --> 35:37.052
Get the licence numbers for any two-ton
trucks stolen in north Dakota recently.

35:37.136 --> 35:40.597
Have Canadian authorities
stop any vehicle fitting that description.

35:40.681 --> 35:43.392
- Tell them they're looking for a bomb.
- What are you doing?

35:43.475 --> 35:45.936
This has been a big setup
from the beginning.

35:46.020 --> 35:48.439
Someone used krycek, then krycek used us.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.524
Someone who didn't want
that rock in us hands.

35:50.607 --> 35:51.942
But what's in Canada?

35:52.026 --> 35:56.030
Where would you put this rock
if you didn't want it to be found?

35:56.113 --> 35:58.032
Back in the ground.

35:59.825 --> 36:03.787
Fenmser
fertiliser for my hothouse tomatoes.

36:03.871 --> 36:06.206
Beautiful tomatoes all year, eh?

36:08.125 --> 36:10.127
Thanks.

36:46.830 --> 36:51.835
Go back to the refinery. See if you can
find anybody that knows about that truck.

38:43.030 --> 38:44.490
(Alarm beeping)

39:10.182 --> 39:14.269
I would just as soon kill you,
but please don't make me.

39:14.353 --> 39:16.939
My work is done.

39:17.022 --> 39:19.024
(Speaks Russian)

39:44.675 --> 39:46.677
Mulder!

39:58.605 --> 40:01.775
- (Gavel pounds)
- I'd like to get started here.

40:01.858 --> 40:04.903
- Miss Scully?
- Yes, I'm ready here, sir.

40:05.362 --> 40:08.991
You have evidence to present.
This is what I've been told.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.076
Yes, sir. Uh...

40:12.077 --> 40:16.039
Evidence linking a number of deaths,
a great number...

40:16.123 --> 40:20.752
To a biotoxin that was
transported to us soil...

40:20.877 --> 40:23.046
By a courier who was also killed.

40:23.130 --> 40:28.218
This was the man who was pushed
from the assistant director's apartment?

40:28.302 --> 40:30.304
Yes. He has not been ID'd.

40:31.430 --> 40:34.891
Do we have the name
of the individual who pushed him?

40:34.975 --> 40:40.564
Yes, sir. Alex krycek,
who is missing and possibly deceased.

40:40.939 --> 40:45.485
And are you then in possession
of the pouch or its contents?

40:45.902 --> 40:47.904
No, sir.

40:51.408 --> 40:54.995
What evidence are you then
presenting us with today?

40:55.078 --> 40:57.748
Documents and interviews...

40:57.831 --> 41:02.878
In support of a wide-ranging conspiracy
to control a lethal biotoxin...

41:02.961 --> 41:06.214
That is, in fact, extraterrestrial.

41:06.298 --> 41:10.719
What, are we talking about
little green men here?

41:10.802 --> 41:14.514
- No, sir. Not at all.
- Why is this so hard to believe?

41:14.598 --> 41:17.267
When the accepted
discovery of life off this planet

41:17.351 --> 41:20.187
is in every newspaper worldwide?

41:20.270 --> 41:23.065
When even conservative scientists

41:23.148 --> 41:25.359
are calling for the exploration
of Mars and Jupiter?

41:25.442 --> 41:30.822
With every reason to believe that life is
thriving outside our own terrestrial sphere?

41:31.782 --> 41:34.493
If you cannot get past this...

41:34.618 --> 41:38.330
Then I suggest this whole committee
be held in contempt...

41:38.455 --> 41:41.500
For ignoring evidence
that cannot be refuted.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.756
This is not why we are here today.

41:47.839 --> 41:50.217
Then why are we here today?

41:53.512 --> 41:59.226
I will suggest that we recess here until
the evidence can be properly evaluated.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.835

44:06.520 --> 44:08.104
(Child) I made this!
