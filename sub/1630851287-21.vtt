BEEF: How was everyone's day
at school?

00:36.095 --> 00:37.127
JUDY:
Amazing.

00:37.187 --> 00:38.537
Mr. Golovkin
wore a novelty T-shirt

00:38.614 --> 00:39.872
that looked
like a doctor's lab coat.

00:40.099 --> 00:42.041
-Oh, that's fun.
-(laughs): Oh,

00:42.268 --> 00:43.767
it was clinically fun.

00:43.786 --> 00:45.786
Uh, paging Dr. Golovkin.

00:45.938 --> 00:47.379
We have a fatal fart attack

00:47.606 --> 00:49.548
-in the Earth Sciences room.
-(Judy laughs)

00:49.699 --> 00:50.774
(Judy and Ham gasp)

00:50.867 --> 00:52.276
-Dad, pull over. Now.
-What's happening?

00:52.294 --> 00:53.777
Ham, did you get
your penis caught

00:53.870 --> 00:55.112
in the seat belt clip again?

00:55.205 --> 00:56.463
KIDS:
Splash Crevasse.

00:56.615 --> 00:58.706
A new indoor water park
in our beloved Alaska

00:58.801 --> 01:00.784
through the miracle
of indoor slide technology?

01:00.953 --> 01:02.286
Dad, if we don't go,

01:02.304 --> 01:04.304
I'm suing for emancipation
from this family.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.881
You know I have a lawyer.
Olivia Objections.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.717
No need to call
Olivia Objections just yet.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.904
A trip to a new
indoor water park sounds fun.

01:12.055 --> 01:14.222
I can't see
why we couldn't go this weekend.

01:14.316 --> 01:15.299
Nope. We can't go.

01:15.392 --> 01:16.650
Beef, control your son, man.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.745
I'm not trying to be a
Leonardo DiCrap-On-Your-Planzio,

01:19.896 --> 01:21.229
but water parks are bad news.

01:21.323 --> 01:23.473
Babe, I thought you'd be
all over an indoor water park.

01:23.492 --> 01:25.084
And I understand
why you would think that.

01:25.235 --> 01:26.418
I'm very fun-loving,

01:26.570 --> 01:27.902
I got
a nominally above-average bod,

01:28.071 --> 01:30.814
and my eyes naturally have
a kind of a gross glaze on them,

01:30.833 --> 01:32.407
which means
I never have to wear goggles.

01:32.501 --> 01:34.927
But indoor water parks
get a big thumbs-down

01:35.154 --> 01:36.578
-from this clown.
-Oh, Wolf.

01:36.746 --> 01:39.414
-Are you still upset about...
-Yes, Father.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.008
I am still upset
about a terrible curse

01:42.161 --> 01:44.010
that hangs over me
like the gray fog of death,

01:44.163 --> 01:46.438
haunting my days
and taunting my nights.

01:46.665 --> 01:47.922
Oh, boy. Here we go.

01:47.942 --> 01:49.516
Wait, what does the fog of death

01:49.668 --> 01:51.092
-have to do
with the new water park?
-JUDY: Well,

01:51.170 --> 01:52.336
we used to have one
in Lone Moose.

01:52.429 --> 01:53.837
It's called Winter World now,

01:53.930 --> 01:55.355
but it used to be known
as Waterworld

01:55.449 --> 01:57.507
based on the movie<i> Waterworld</i>
until Kevin Costner

01:57.526 --> 01:59.843
filed a very devastating lawsuit
against it.

01:59.862 --> 02:02.604
Amazing movie,
even more amazing lawsuit.

02:02.623 --> 02:03.789
Basically, one summer,

02:04.016 --> 02:05.273
every time Wolf
went to Waterworld,

02:05.292 --> 02:06.533
he lost his swim trunks.

02:06.685 --> 02:09.353
And turned Waterworld
into Wienerworld.

02:09.371 --> 02:11.713
Smell you later, nerd-a-gators.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.375
Oh, no!

02:15.469 --> 02:16.526
My trunks!

02:16.545 --> 02:17.711
Oh, no! My tr...

02:17.863 --> 02:19.696
Oh, n... O... B...

02:19.715 --> 02:22.624
Oh, no. My trunks.

02:22.718 --> 02:24.368
Yeah, I was just a teen Wolf

02:24.386 --> 02:26.478
when I realized
that water parks are cursed.

02:26.630 --> 02:28.538
How is it we've never talked
about how you get to say,

02:28.632 --> 02:30.983
"I was a teen Wolf"?
Babe, that rules.

02:31.210 --> 02:33.134
I know, yeah. It fully rips.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.637
Wolf, how can Splash Crevasse
be cursed?

02:35.764 --> 02:36.822
It's brand-new.

02:36.973 --> 02:38.473
I believe
all water parks are cursed.

02:38.567 --> 02:40.492
I also lost my trunks
that time we stayed at the hotel

02:40.644 --> 02:43.328
with the waterslide in Ketchikan
when we went looking for Mom.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.980
Oh, yeah. We found her
behind that Wendy's.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.166
Sleeping like a baby,

02:47.393 --> 02:49.559
just absolutely covered
in Baconator wrappers.

02:49.578 --> 02:51.061
Well, I'm sorry, Wolf,
but I'm going.

02:51.079 --> 02:52.579
I saw on the news
that Jason Patric

02:52.731 --> 02:54.006
was gonna be there
signing autographs,

02:54.233 --> 02:55.507
and I'm gonna bring a script
from<i> Speed 2</i>

02:55.734 --> 02:57.158
and see if he'll read a scene
with me.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.660
Okay, that's fine. You guys go.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.346
-Me and Dad
will hang out here and...
-Son, you know

03:01.573 --> 03:02.681
I don't enjoy leisure,

03:02.832 --> 03:05.517
but I do very much enjoy
seeing my family happy.

03:05.627 --> 03:07.853
Well, fine.
Then I'm gonna have fun, too.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.746
But I'm not paying
good American money

03:09.765 --> 03:12.173
to embarrass myself
at some trunk-sucking hellhole.

03:12.267 --> 03:15.027
I'm going swimming
at, uh, nature's water park,

03:15.178 --> 03:16.695
Lone Moose Beach.

03:16.846 --> 03:19.773
Lone Moose Beach is just
a ten-square-foot patch of rocks

03:19.849 --> 03:21.441
next to the oil refinery.

03:21.593 --> 03:23.427
Isn't that where they found
the seal with the human nose?

03:23.445 --> 03:25.019
No. And I'm gonna have more fun

03:25.039 --> 03:27.355
at Lone Moose Beach
than you could ever have

03:27.374 --> 03:28.615
at Splash Crev-sucks.

03:28.767 --> 03:31.376
Well, I'd better go get ready.
Big day tomorrow.

03:31.603 --> 03:33.603
But actually,
step one of me getting ready

03:33.697 --> 03:36.030
is gonna be to sit back down
and finish my dinner,

03:36.050 --> 03:38.217
because I'm gonna be
swimming so much tomorrow.

03:38.368 --> 03:39.367
Hoo!

03:39.386 --> 03:41.202
BEEF:
Splash Crevasse, here we come.

03:41.329 --> 03:43.204
Are you guys sure you don't want
to eat some breakfast

03:43.298 --> 03:44.539
before we get on the road?

03:44.633 --> 03:46.207
And waste precious time

03:46.227 --> 03:48.118
that could be spent splashing
and crevassing?

03:48.136 --> 03:50.229
Hello. Yes, can you connect me
with my lawyer,

03:50.456 --> 03:51.805
Olivia Objections?

03:51.957 --> 03:54.399
Moon, you cannot threaten
to have your imaginary lawyer

03:54.626 --> 03:56.460
sue me
every time I say anything.

03:56.553 --> 03:57.811
And just to revisit it,

03:57.963 --> 04:00.722
asking you to empty
the dishwasher is not a felony.

04:00.816 --> 04:02.890
Don't worry, Dad. They have
two separate snack bars.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.559
Remember?
It was on the evening news.

04:04.653 --> 04:06.578
I was surprised they dedicated
the entire hour

04:06.805 --> 04:08.580
to covering the water park,
but I have to say,

04:08.732 --> 04:10.064
it was very informative.

04:10.084 --> 04:12.400
-Oh, great. Wolf's coming.
-Wolf is not coming.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.661
Wolf is going.
To Lone Moose Beach.

04:14.813 --> 04:16.997
Like he said.
Which will be way more fun.

04:17.149 --> 04:19.499
And where no one
will see my wiener. Ow!

04:19.668 --> 04:22.502
I'm fine. It's just a pebble
got in my flip-flop.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.012
Ow. Ow. Ow.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.932
Houston, we have a beach.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.009
Now, who needs Splash Crevasse

04:29.085 --> 04:32.920
when I've got
nature's Splash Crev-this.

04:32.998 --> 04:34.106
Selfie time.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.608
Okay, I'll just crop
those garbage bags out.

04:36.835 --> 04:39.111
And, uh,
send to family group text.

04:39.262 --> 04:40.504
(exhales)
Nippy today.

04:40.597 --> 04:42.281
But once the sun peeks out
from those clouds,

04:42.508 --> 04:44.265
I'm sure it'll be
nice and toasty.

04:44.359 --> 04:45.342
(shivers)

04:45.360 --> 04:48.011
Ooh, snack time, baby.
(chuckles)

04:48.030 --> 04:49.179
Oh, wai... Aah.

04:49.197 --> 04:51.290
Got the whole day ahead of me.

04:51.441 --> 04:53.333
Sick.

04:55.629 --> 04:58.279
ALL:
Wow.

04:58.373 --> 05:00.707
Okay, what does everyone
want to do first?

05:00.801 --> 05:02.467
Call me Wave Pool-ier,

05:02.694 --> 05:06.046
because I'm about to go, uh,
in the wave pool.

05:06.198 --> 05:07.806
I'm a lazy river lad, myself.

05:08.033 --> 05:10.792
And I'm hitting the DeathSlide.
I heard it's so scary

05:10.886 --> 05:12.477
that most people
pee their swimsuits,

05:12.704 --> 05:15.296
which adds more liquid,
which means you go even faster.

05:15.432 --> 05:16.798
(chuckles):
Wonderful. And I guess

05:16.817 --> 05:18.483
I will just sit
at a picnic table.

05:18.635 --> 05:20.468
-I love sitting.
-HONEYBEE: They're gone.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.546
They didn't even hear you finish
saying the word "wonderful."

05:22.564 --> 05:24.731
-Wonderful.
-Look, Beef. They have

05:24.883 --> 05:25.882
a mermaid show.
Want to check that out later?

05:25.901 --> 05:27.308
(chuckles):
No, thank you.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.902
Like any sailor,
I know the dangers

05:28.996 --> 05:31.571
of being lured in
by the siren's song.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.831
Why don't I just go with you

05:33.000 --> 05:35.575
to meet this, uh...
celebrity fisherman?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.394
Jason Patric is an actor.

05:37.412 --> 05:39.153
That is fine.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.339
Maybe Dad was right

05:40.566 --> 05:41.731
and we should have
had breakfast.

05:41.825 --> 05:43.233
-I'm really hungry.
-Ugh, same.

05:43.326 --> 05:45.159
My mind says "lazy river,"

05:45.253 --> 05:47.237
but my tummy says
"food me-giver."

05:47.330 --> 05:49.848
Not me. I've been sentenced
to the DeathSlide,

05:49.999 --> 05:51.850
and my last meal is speed.

05:51.927 --> 05:53.852
So, you thinking
what I'm thinking?

05:54.079 --> 05:55.579
Mm, that we turn
into miserable monsters

05:55.597 --> 05:57.672
when we're hungry,
so we should get nachos,

05:57.691 --> 06:00.083
but that it doesn't make sense
for both of us to go,

06:00.085 --> 06:01.509
so we should play
Bread, Cheese, Toothpick

06:01.603 --> 06:03.028
-to see who goes
to get the food?
-Exactly.

06:03.255 --> 06:04.345
-Bread. Cheese. Toothpick.
-Bread. Cheese. Toothpick.

06:04.439 --> 06:06.439
(laughs)
Toothpick spears cheese.

06:06.516 --> 06:09.534
-Ugh, fine.
-Get a good look.

06:09.611 --> 06:11.277
The next time you see me,
I'll be so relaxed

06:11.430 --> 06:14.114
from my trip on the lazy river,
you probably won't recognize me.

06:14.266 --> 06:17.434
I'll be all like, "Ah. Yeah."

06:17.452 --> 06:19.119
Oh, it's only been
seven minutes?

06:19.271 --> 06:21.713
Okay, skip this jazz.
I'm going home.

06:21.865 --> 06:22.881
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

06:23.125 --> 06:25.792
When did this town get
so many friggin' pebbles?

06:25.944 --> 06:27.219
Oh, look, my favorite shortcut.

06:27.370 --> 06:29.629
I used to take this bad boy home
from Cheesecake's house

06:29.723 --> 06:30.947
all the time in high school.

06:30.966 --> 06:33.708
Now this is a waterslide, baby!

06:33.802 --> 06:34.876
(whooping, shouts)

06:34.895 --> 06:37.044
Oh. When did they add
this grate?

06:37.139 --> 06:39.564
Houston, we have a dang it!

06:42.794 --> 06:44.978
No, no, no, no. This is bad.

06:45.188 --> 06:46.479
You're trapped at the bottom
of a drainpipe,

06:46.632 --> 06:47.906
and there's a grate
blocking your way through

06:48.133 --> 06:49.482
that definitely
did not used to be there.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.484
Uh, maybe there's
a latch somewhere?

06:51.637 --> 06:54.079
(grunts)
Teenage mutant ninja turds!

06:54.230 --> 06:56.156
If there is, I can't reach it.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.733
Help, anybody! Even Londra.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.327
Okay, Wolf, think-- WWHBD.

07:01.422 --> 07:04.147
What would Honeybee do?
Oh, of course!

07:04.166 --> 07:07.074
I'll climb out.
Great idea, Honeybee.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.093
Simple, but elegant.

07:08.244 --> 07:10.487
(grunts)
Oh, boy.

07:10.656 --> 07:12.172
That is more slippery
than a watermelon

07:12.266 --> 07:14.599
wearing Aveeno. Uh, hmm.

07:14.826 --> 07:15.917
Oh! Okay, well, if I just

07:16.011 --> 07:18.011
gnaw my own arm off
like that one guy

07:18.163 --> 07:19.829
in that one movie where
he gnaws his own arm off,

07:19.848 --> 07:23.442
I might be skinny enough
to squeeze between these bars.

07:23.593 --> 07:25.110
(grunting)

07:25.337 --> 07:27.504
(sighs) Oh, my God!
This is taking forever.

07:27.597 --> 07:29.614
And I don't even have
any arm sauce.

07:29.766 --> 07:31.599
This is worse than the time
that I got stuck

07:31.693 --> 07:33.952
inside the claw machine
at Duck Duck Golf.

07:34.103 --> 07:36.029
And worse than the time
that I got stuck

07:36.123 --> 07:38.848
in the claw machine
at Tippy Toppy Taqueria.

07:39.017 --> 07:40.107
Here's your large nachos.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.442
But we're out of cheese.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.369
What?
Why would you sell me nachos

07:43.464 --> 07:44.946
if you knew
you were out of cheese?

07:45.023 --> 07:47.299
Uh, because we weren't out
of nachos, just out of cheese.

07:47.526 --> 07:49.025
-(groans)
-There should be some

07:49.027 --> 07:51.711
in the dispensers
at the north side snack bar.

07:51.863 --> 07:53.638
JUDY:
Uh...

07:53.715 --> 07:55.882
do you have a plastic bag or
something I could put these in?

07:56.034 --> 07:57.534
I don't want them to get wet.

07:57.627 --> 07:58.643
Did you say something?

07:58.795 --> 07:59.811
I said thank you for everything.

07:59.963 --> 08:01.480
This is absolutely perfect.

08:01.631 --> 08:02.722
Excuse me, do you know

08:02.799 --> 08:04.224
how long the wait is from here?

08:04.376 --> 08:06.209
If you have to ask,
you don't have what it takes.

08:06.302 --> 08:08.636
Okay, but do you know?

08:08.655 --> 08:11.414
Yeah, two hours. It says it
on that sign over there.

08:11.416 --> 08:13.307
Why didn't you just
point to the sign?

08:13.401 --> 08:14.493
I'm just going through a lot.

08:14.644 --> 08:16.236
My grandparents are
getting divorced.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.737
They were together for 50 years.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.906
Grandma thinks she's gonna
do better than Grandpa?

08:20.058 --> 08:21.333
Good luck, Mona.

08:21.409 --> 08:22.834
Two hours, huh?

08:22.986 --> 08:24.169
Oh. Whoops.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.246
Sorry. My bad.
(chuckles)

08:26.398 --> 08:28.489
Oh, sorry, were you here first?

08:28.583 --> 08:30.066
Okay, yeah, no problem.

08:30.085 --> 08:32.326
Maybe I'll just...
Yeah, no, enjoy.

08:32.420 --> 08:34.495
(laughs)
I'm happy to wait.

08:34.664 --> 08:36.014
Have fun.

08:36.165 --> 08:37.331
Oh, no, you go.

08:37.425 --> 08:39.576
All right, will you help me
practice my lines?

08:39.594 --> 08:41.502
I want to be off book
when we get

08:41.596 --> 08:42.687
to the front and meet JP.

08:42.839 --> 08:44.338
<i> (singer vocalizing over P.A.)</i>

08:44.358 --> 08:45.524
<i> WOMAN (over P.A.):</i>
<i> Seating for the mermaid show</i>

08:45.675 --> 08:46.841
<i> is now open.</i>

08:46.860 --> 08:49.602
<i> -(vocalizing)</i>
-Oh, no, the mermaids.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.530
They call me. I must go.

08:51.681 --> 08:53.347
Nay, I mustn't.

08:53.367 --> 08:54.181
Are you okay?

08:54.201 --> 08:55.942
Oh, how those dampen damsels

08:56.094 --> 08:57.277
lure me to my ruin.

08:57.429 --> 08:59.037
Tie me to that cement pillar,
like Ulysses

08:59.264 --> 09:01.022
had his sailors tie him
to the mast of their ship

09:01.116 --> 09:02.374
as they approached the sirens.

09:02.601 --> 09:04.209
-What?
-Do you have any wax with which

09:04.436 --> 09:06.269
to plug your ears
lest you be ensorcelled?

09:06.362 --> 09:07.862
No, I don't have any ear wax.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.215
And where am I gonna to get rope
to tie you to that big-ass pole?

09:10.366 --> 09:12.384
You know I always bring
a large coil

09:12.535 --> 09:14.444
of rope wherever I go
in case I suddenly

09:14.462 --> 09:16.537
find myself in need
of a large coil of rope.

09:16.631 --> 09:18.114
Right, mm-hmm, okay.

09:18.133 --> 09:19.783
Hi, would you watch my spot?

09:19.785 --> 09:21.134
I just have to tie
my father-in-law

09:21.228 --> 09:22.802
to that cement pole over there
so that he doesn't

09:22.971 --> 09:24.929
accidentally see the mermaid
show like they did in<i> Ulysses.</i>

09:25.156 --> 09:26.306
Sure.

09:26.458 --> 09:29.292
Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man.

09:29.311 --> 09:32.796
(gasps) Dad? Guys?
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

09:32.889 --> 09:34.388
You were right,
Lone Moose Beach was

09:34.408 --> 09:36.800
a huge mistake. You guys want

09:36.968 --> 09:38.802
to form a human chain
and come get me?

09:38.970 --> 09:40.895
-Guys?
-(hissing)

09:40.914 --> 09:43.230
Dad, why are you hissing
like that? Wait.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.658
Hey. You're not my family.

09:45.752 --> 09:46.918
You're marmots.

09:47.070 --> 09:48.661
(sighs)
You guys want to form

09:48.755 --> 09:50.422
a marmot chain and come get me?

09:50.591 --> 09:53.316
Okay, Judy, you've studied
this water maze long enough.

09:53.409 --> 09:57.095
If you want these chips cheesy,
it just ain't gonna be easy.

09:57.246 --> 09:59.005
My God, I just sounded cool.

09:59.157 --> 10:00.840
(laughs)
Okay, just pretend the chips

10:00.934 --> 10:03.509
are your first
major art installation,

10:03.662 --> 10:06.938
and it's a fragile oeuvre
of tremendous purity,

10:07.090 --> 10:09.107
and the water park is
the coffee shop, of course,

10:09.258 --> 10:11.425
that has agreed to hang
your work on its walls

10:11.445 --> 10:14.187
for nine days.
That's over a week, Judy.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.022
Over a week. Let's go!

10:16.174 --> 10:19.117
Stay away
from my fragile oeuvre.

10:19.194 --> 10:21.177
This Lucite basketball

10:21.196 --> 10:23.121
rejects your value system.

10:23.348 --> 10:25.365
Ham, you should've seen me.

10:25.517 --> 10:27.274
(groans)
Forget it, keep your tubes.

10:27.294 --> 10:28.627
I didn't even want
to have a really fun time

10:28.854 --> 10:30.186
-in the lazy river anyway.
-(gasps)

10:30.279 --> 10:33.298
Ham, no! Why'd you knock
those out of my hands?

10:33.525 --> 10:35.375
Why'd you sneak up behind me?

10:35.469 --> 10:36.801
Well, I'm glad
the nachos at least

10:36.878 --> 10:38.027
got a chance
to ride the lazy river.

10:38.046 --> 10:39.971
JUDY:
Oh, great, and that guy

10:40.198 --> 10:41.214
-is enjoying one.
-(sighs)

10:41.366 --> 10:43.290
Sorry I snapped.
I'm just so hungry.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.535
And this lazy river was
a lazy failure.

10:45.553 --> 10:47.628
I'll go get us
some more nachos, okay?

10:47.706 --> 10:49.205
-Make it up to you?
-I'd like to see you try.

10:49.298 --> 10:52.058
Sorry. I meant that, I<i> would</i>
really like to see you try.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.152
Because I'm very hungry
and very cranky.

10:54.379 --> 10:56.303
Maybe I'll go over
to the wave pool

10:56.323 --> 10:58.639
and let the gentle lapping
of the water calm me down.

10:58.733 --> 11:00.641
Or maybe I'll just kill someone!

11:00.735 --> 11:03.912
(laughing):
We'll see what happens today.

11:04.647 --> 11:05.905
Get it together, Wolf.

11:06.057 --> 11:07.907
You are not gonna bite
the friggin' big one

11:08.001 --> 11:09.501
in this frang-dang drainpipe.

11:09.652 --> 11:12.912
Okay, think.
WWDD-- what would Dad do?

11:12.989 --> 11:15.656
Well that's easy.
He would just B-A-T-C-O-R.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.734
Bring a thick coil of rope.

11:17.827 --> 11:19.160
(sighs)
I don't have one,

11:19.328 --> 11:21.262
but maybe I can make one.

11:22.574 --> 11:24.182
(grunts)

11:24.351 --> 11:25.350
(whooping)

11:25.577 --> 11:27.018
Oh, way to go, Dad.

11:27.245 --> 11:29.746
Hey. Uh-uh.
Get off of my rope, marmot.

11:29.764 --> 11:32.190
Just gonna shake him off.

11:32.341 --> 11:34.417
Oh, god, I don't want
to get a marmot bite.

11:34.436 --> 11:36.920
I'm too young to die
of marmot rabies-- aah!

11:37.088 --> 11:39.513
(grunts)
Houston, we have a broken rope.

11:39.607 --> 11:42.158
And a very sore bottom
as well, Houston.

11:46.355 --> 11:48.598
Dang it!
Now the marmots have my shirt.

11:48.616 --> 11:51.042
You're not allowed
to wear that, stupid marmots!

11:51.194 --> 11:53.770
Take this.
(grunting)

11:54.530 --> 11:56.272
Okay, Wolf,
you've tried everything

11:56.365 --> 11:58.049
Honeybee and Dad would do.

11:58.201 --> 11:59.700
You're on your own.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.386
No helpie but your selfie.

12:01.537 --> 12:02.962
(gasps)
Selfie.

12:03.114 --> 12:05.206
Houston, we have an idea.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.707
I can use
my phone camera to look

12:06.727 --> 12:08.451
for the latch on the gate again.

12:08.470 --> 12:11.120
Oh, God, Houston, we only have
one percent battery.

12:11.214 --> 12:14.048
Got to start charging
my phone at night, Houston.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.084
Aha! There is a latch.

12:16.086 --> 12:18.219
Now if I can just get
the selfie stick

12:18.296 --> 12:20.146
underneath the...

12:20.298 --> 12:22.465
Houston, we have a bingo.

12:23.151 --> 12:25.893
Bye, marmots.
Sorry I called you guys cusses.

12:25.912 --> 12:27.637
I was just hecka stressed.

12:27.730 --> 12:29.305
Okay, family, here I co--

12:29.398 --> 12:31.991
Ow. Ow. Freakin' pebbles.

12:32.143 --> 12:34.235
Okay, big guy,
here's your nachos.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.754
But, I got to warn you, champ,

12:35.905 --> 12:37.330
they're really just
dry tortilla chips

12:37.424 --> 12:38.757
because we ran out of cheese.

12:38.833 --> 12:40.817
Fun nicknames. Like "big guy."

12:40.835 --> 12:42.835
Love "champ." But-- wait.

12:42.988 --> 12:44.596
You're also out of cheese?

12:44.747 --> 12:45.838
Yeah, but don't worry.

12:45.991 --> 12:47.081
I think they just got
some more cheese

12:47.175 --> 12:48.916
back at the south side
snack bar, boss.

12:49.010 --> 12:52.011
Okay, thank you, Santa Claus.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.981
Sorry, I'm not as good
as you at nicknames.

12:57.669 --> 13:00.111
Oh, hell no.

13:00.338 --> 13:01.687
I'm okay.
(gasping)

13:01.782 --> 13:03.339
I actually love thi--

13:03.432 --> 13:05.842
What a wonderful...
time I'm having. (gasps)

13:05.860 --> 13:07.786
(groans)
The hell with this.

13:07.937 --> 13:09.529
What are you doing?
Are you nuts?

13:09.623 --> 13:10.771
Are<i> you</i> nuts?

13:10.791 --> 13:12.181
I'll be in ninth grade
by the time

13:12.200 --> 13:13.607
I get to the front of this line.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.351
But everyone's peeing
in the water out of fear.

13:15.370 --> 13:17.462
Which only makes it faster.

13:17.689 --> 13:19.613
-Hey, how was the wave pool?
-Bad. It was bad.

13:19.633 --> 13:22.467
Somebody either kicked me
or bit me in the head.

13:22.694 --> 13:24.710
And when I got out,
I had a swim diaper on my foot.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.638
Wait, are those the nachos?

13:26.789 --> 13:28.789
Why are they dry, Ham?

13:28.883 --> 13:31.701
Oh, man, why are they dry?!

13:31.794 --> 13:33.794
Well, about that...

13:33.888 --> 13:36.314
Why not just plop a large cup
of sand in front of me,

13:36.465 --> 13:38.650
-you nasty freak!
-This place sucks.

13:38.801 --> 13:40.801
Maybe Wolf was right
about that curse.

13:40.895 --> 13:42.320
Oh, Wolf was definitely right.

13:42.471 --> 13:44.972
They should call this place
Splashed Cursed-vasse.

13:45.066 --> 13:47.141
And I know that's not
good wordplay. I know it.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.828
Uh, are you just eating
dry tortilla chips?

13:49.979 --> 13:51.554
They're out of nacho cheese.

13:51.573 --> 13:53.556
Apparently they might have some
at the south side snack bar.

13:53.575 --> 13:56.835
Oh, goo-- I want to burn
this place to the ground so bad,

13:57.062 --> 13:58.561
but it would just be
logistically very hard

13:58.654 --> 14:00.413
to set a water park on fire.
(groans)

14:00.507 --> 14:02.323
So now we have to carry
these dry chips

14:02.417 --> 14:03.675
across the entire water park

14:03.751 --> 14:05.159
without getting them wet again?

14:05.178 --> 14:06.419
"Again"? (scoffs)

14:06.537 --> 14:08.421
You should've come to me
in the first place.

14:08.497 --> 14:10.406
This is obviously
a job best suited

14:10.425 --> 14:11.832
for my particular skill set.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.593
Your particular skill set?

14:13.745 --> 14:16.170
Judy, please, just let me work.

14:16.264 --> 14:18.005
Aah, it's happening! Beep, beep!

14:18.024 --> 14:20.083
I'm pulling off
for Jason Patric station.

14:20.101 --> 14:21.508
-Bye, Beef. Stay strong.
-(mermaid show music playing)

14:21.528 --> 14:23.177
(grunts) Have fun.

14:23.254 --> 14:24.345
And don't worry about me.

14:24.364 --> 14:28.349
I'm fine. I shall resist
those temptresses.

14:29.110 --> 14:31.018
I've got to get
to Splash Crevasse.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.445
My family
needs me.

14:32.597 --> 14:35.098
Oh, why, oh, why won't anyone
pick me up?

14:35.116 --> 14:37.116
I'm an absolute sweetie.

14:37.268 --> 14:39.936
Cheese retrieved
and returning to home base.

14:39.954 --> 14:42.788
Out of my way! Number one
nacho boy coming through!

14:42.941 --> 14:46.626
Hey. Careful. I'm loaded down
with precious cargo here.

14:46.702 --> 14:48.127
What's going on?

14:48.221 --> 14:49.629
The teen who guards
the top of the DeathSlide

14:49.797 --> 14:51.797
making sure everyone waits
the two minutes between sliders

14:51.892 --> 14:53.299
to go down
has fallen asleep.

14:53.376 --> 14:55.042
It's<i> The Purge,</i> but
for going down the waterslide

14:55.061 --> 14:56.953
-as much as you want.
-Yes.

14:57.046 --> 14:59.472
All right, boys,
it's time to fly.

14:59.624 --> 15:01.474
Oh, no. It's happening.

15:01.626 --> 15:02.808
A siren approaches.

15:02.961 --> 15:04.885
I must dance
with these mermaids.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.405
Enchantresses,
I have received your invitation.

15:07.632 --> 15:09.632
I am RSVPing yes.

15:09.725 --> 15:11.576
(screaming)

15:11.803 --> 15:13.727
Come on, come on.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.638
Yes, I got one! Sick.

15:15.657 --> 15:18.065
Thank you so much,
I was starting to worry

15:18.159 --> 15:19.584
that nobody was ever
gonna stop for me.

15:19.735 --> 15:21.994
I mean, I know I look
a little rough around the edges,

15:22.163 --> 15:23.813
and you're probably thinking,
"Check, please."

15:23.831 --> 15:27.074
But, trust me, you just won
the hitchhiker lottery.

15:27.168 --> 15:28.575
Hi, I'm Wolf.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.669
Name's Neckbone.

15:29.821 --> 15:31.170
Oh. Wow. Beautiful name.

15:31.322 --> 15:33.097
-You want some of this coffee?
-Oh, no thank you.

15:33.249 --> 15:34.766
I had three Mountain Dew
Code Reds at the beach.

15:34.917 --> 15:37.843
And two regular Mountain Dews
and a chocolate milk.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.679
Well, what brings you to
the side of the highway, Wolf?

15:39.831 --> 15:41.940
Long story short, Neckbone,
I was so worried

15:42.091 --> 15:43.424
my swim trunks were
gonna fall off,

15:43.592 --> 15:44.959
because of how
all water parks are cursed,

15:45.019 --> 15:46.335
that I got trapped in a sewer

15:46.429 --> 15:47.779
and tried to chew
my own arm off.

15:47.930 --> 15:49.430
But I didn't have any arm sauce,

15:49.598 --> 15:50.949
so now I got to get
to Splash Crevasse

15:51.025 --> 15:52.508
to find my family,
who are not marmots.

15:52.601 --> 15:54.619
-Tale as old as time.
-So what do you haul?

15:54.846 --> 15:57.196
I'll give ya a clue.
My legal name's Neckbone,

15:57.365 --> 15:59.182
but my road handle
is Skull Digger.

15:59.275 --> 16:01.942
Both beautiful.
Let me guess-- you haul...

16:02.036 --> 16:03.869
uh... necklaces.
No, no, no, no!

16:03.964 --> 16:06.189
Uh, Christmas-themed necklaces.

16:06.207 --> 16:07.707
Heh, close. Skeletons.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.026
You know those ones
they have in science classes

16:10.028 --> 16:11.377
and what have you?
Well, I pick 'em up

16:11.471 --> 16:13.504
when they still got
all the gunk on 'em.

16:13.731 --> 16:14.714
Now, when you say "gunk,"

16:14.808 --> 16:16.048
do you mean
flesh and human tissue?

16:16.201 --> 16:18.050
Yeah, the "gunk."
I take 'em up to my buddy

16:18.203 --> 16:19.811
whose got some acid vats
and we, you know,

16:19.962 --> 16:21.537
we kind of clean 'em up,
you know,

16:21.630 --> 16:23.130
so the kids can learn.

16:23.208 --> 16:24.315
Oh, wow. Houston,

16:24.467 --> 16:27.193
we have a ride
and a great new friend.

16:31.232 --> 16:33.157
So you didn't go to the
water park with your family

16:33.309 --> 16:34.567
because of a curse?

16:34.719 --> 16:36.052
Well, I mean,
if your swim trunks fell off

16:36.145 --> 16:37.644
every time you
went to the water park,

16:37.664 --> 16:39.313
what would you call that,
if not a curse?

16:39.407 --> 16:41.240
Oh, that's a curse for sure.

16:41.392 --> 16:43.059
Big time. And I would know.

16:43.077 --> 16:44.651
I was cursed for a few years.
It seemed, like,

16:44.671 --> 16:46.746
you know, my house
would burn down every time

16:46.898 --> 16:48.322
I left a candle burning indoors

16:48.341 --> 16:49.841
when I went out of town
for the weekend.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.676
Well, that seems
a little different.

16:51.827 --> 16:53.327
Well, h-how do you figure?

16:53.346 --> 16:54.679
Well, that just seems like
you faced a consequence--

16:54.906 --> 16:57.181
your house burning down--
for a bad choice you made--

16:57.333 --> 16:58.574
leaving a candle burning indoors

16:58.593 --> 17:00.167
when you went out of town
for the weekend.

17:00.261 --> 17:01.927
That's not a curse.

17:02.080 --> 17:03.855
Hey, hey, that's a new way
of looking at it, now go on.

17:04.082 --> 17:05.915
I mean, if my swim trunks
kept falling off

17:05.933 --> 17:08.175
as a direct consequence
of a bad choice I made,

17:08.194 --> 17:10.010
we'd be having a very different

17:10.030 --> 17:12.088
conversa... tion.

17:12.181 --> 17:14.273
Don't go head first,
your trunks will slide off.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.701
Smell ya later, nerd-a-gators.

17:18.854 --> 17:21.447
New Kids on the Crap! My trunks!

17:21.599 --> 17:23.616
Hey, get out of there.
We're doing surf night,

17:23.768 --> 17:24.950
and the waves are turned way up.

17:25.103 --> 17:27.361
-It'll rip your suit clean off.
-Relax.

17:27.455 --> 17:29.622
I know what I'm doing.
(grunts)

17:29.774 --> 17:31.607
Oh, no! My trunks!

17:31.626 --> 17:32.942
Cool shirt.

17:33.111 --> 17:35.035
Does it say
"Pants Me, I Dare You"?

17:35.055 --> 17:36.946
Yeah. Oh, no.

17:36.964 --> 17:38.130
-(laughter)
-My trunks.

17:38.283 --> 17:40.283
Aw, man,
water parks aren't cursed.

17:40.301 --> 17:42.618
I'm just a ding-dang dumb-dumb,

17:42.637 --> 17:44.637
who's constantly
ignoring fair warnings,

17:44.731 --> 17:46.064
jumping into things headfirst,

17:46.215 --> 17:48.958
and making bad T-shirt choices.
(gasps)

17:48.976 --> 17:50.902
Even today, when I got stuck
in the drainpipe

17:51.053 --> 17:52.795
under the road, I remember
there was some kind of sign

17:52.814 --> 17:55.722
that said "warning" on it--
a literal warning sign--

17:55.742 --> 17:57.466
and I ignored it.
(sighs)

17:57.485 --> 17:59.318
I should probably change my name
to Goof Tobin.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.395
It's only two letters different,
so hopefully

18:01.414 --> 18:03.139
-it won't be very expensive.
-Hey.

18:03.308 --> 18:04.582
Don't be so hard
on yourself, Wolfie.

18:04.733 --> 18:06.751
Do you know how many skeletons
my buddy and I had

18:06.978 --> 18:08.902
to just throw in the lake
because we couldn't get

18:08.996 --> 18:10.646
the last bit of gunk off 'em?

18:10.739 --> 18:12.423
But eventually we figured out
we got to mix a little bit

18:12.575 --> 18:15.242
of sulfuric acid in
with the hydrofluoric acid.

18:15.336 --> 18:17.744
And we haven't thrown
a skeleton in the lake in years.

18:17.913 --> 18:19.672
Because we learned
from our mistakes.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.100
Thanks, Neckbone.
That's very inspirational.

18:22.251 --> 18:25.752
I know. Now, let's get you
to your family, okay?

18:25.772 --> 18:28.231
<i> Here he come!</i>

18:29.016 --> 18:30.608
Flush me to hell!

18:30.759 --> 18:32.777
(shouting)

18:32.928 --> 18:35.530
(whooping)

18:36.432 --> 18:38.357
-Ah...
-JUDY: Hello, Moon.

18:38.509 --> 18:39.842
Oh. Hey, guys.

18:39.935 --> 18:42.528
Do tell, did you manage to use
your particular skill set

18:42.605 --> 18:44.938
to find any cheese
for the nachos?

18:45.032 --> 18:46.515
Yes.

18:46.517 --> 18:48.442
Well, you better call
your make-believe lawyer,

18:48.519 --> 18:50.110
Olivia Objections,
and tell her to meet you

18:50.130 --> 18:52.279
at the fantasy courthouse,
because I'm about

18:52.298 --> 18:53.539
to get real litigious.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.283
(groans) Come on, let's go find
Dad and Honeybee

18:56.302 --> 18:58.970
and tear out of this wet fart.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.955
Honeybee, we have to go.
Where's Dad?

19:02.049 --> 19:03.457
Your father is lashed
to a cement pole,

19:03.626 --> 19:04.809
but we can't leave
before I meet--

19:04.960 --> 19:06.719
Who the hell is that idiot?

19:06.871 --> 19:08.128
You're not Jason Patric.

19:08.206 --> 19:09.480
No, sorry. I'm Greg Dorp.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.816
I'm just sitting here to let
people know that Jason Patric

19:11.967 --> 19:13.818
had to cancel.
He got a job in Atlanta,

19:13.895 --> 19:15.469
filming a Nescafé commercial,

19:15.563 --> 19:17.155
exclusively
for the Greek Islands market.

19:17.382 --> 19:19.306
Why didn't you make
an announcement to everyone?

19:19.400 --> 19:21.308
Why are you telling people
one on one?

19:21.327 --> 19:22.718
I'm also a grief counselor.

19:22.737 --> 19:23.828
This is just how I do things.

19:23.979 --> 19:25.479
Wolf was right--
this place is cursed.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.148
Now let's get your dad
and get the hell out of here.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.149
MOON:
Uh-oh.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.393
(gasps) Where did he go?

19:35.400 --> 19:37.675

19:37.902 --> 19:40.903

19:40.996 --> 19:42.180

it's my own bad choices that are

I let my fear
of a dumb curse keep me

20:04.019 --> 20:05.928
from a day of fun
with my family.

20:05.947 --> 20:07.613
And that was the real curse.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.098
Well, good luck out there, Wolf.

20:09.116 --> 20:10.708
For a bunch of gunk

Babe, are you okay?
What happened to you?

20:18.867 --> 20:20.701
It's a long story.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.054
And we can't wait to hear
all about it on the ride home,

20:23.205 --> 20:24.388
but let's get out of here.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.282
You were right, Wolf,
this place is cursed.

20:26.284 --> 20:28.041
No, but that's the thing,
I realized today

20:28.061 --> 20:29.969
the water park
isn't cursed at all.

20:30.121 --> 20:31.804
The reason everyone
kept seeing my wiener

20:31.898 --> 20:34.123
is because
of my own poor choices,

20:34.141 --> 20:36.049
not dumb luck
or fate, or a curse, or--

20:36.143 --> 20:37.050
Oh. Oh, no!

20:37.144 --> 20:38.903
-(all gasp)
-Oh, no!

My trunks.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.650
but windows down
