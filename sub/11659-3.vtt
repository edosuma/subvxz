01:01.200 --> 01:03.367
Is this 6151 Richmond street?

01:03.433 --> 01:06.266
-Ma, what's the matter?
-Oh, Dorothy, it's you.

01:06.333 --> 01:09.834
I broke my glasses at the mall.
I can't see a thing.

01:09.900 --> 01:13.133
It took me six hours
to find my way home.

01:13.200 --> 01:16.934
Why didn't you call me
to come get you?

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
I tried to. Every time
I deposited a dime and dialed,

01:20.066 --> 01:21.767
a condom popped out.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.166
I got five
in my pocket.

01:31.233 --> 01:35.400
Here, Dorothy...
a lifetime supply.

01:42.333 --> 01:45.667
Dorothy, which necklace
looks better with this dress,

01:45.734 --> 01:47.834
this gold chain or the pearls?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.667
They both look nice, Blanche.

01:49.734 --> 01:53.900
You think pearls nestled
in the ample cleavage

01:53.967 --> 01:55.734
revealed by my clinging,
low-cut gown

01:55.800 --> 01:59.100
might suggest I'm nothing
but a cheap, easy good time?

02:00.367 --> 02:03.400
-They might.
-That settles it. Pearls it is.

02:03.900 --> 02:06.533
Blanche, you look terrific.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.500
You look like
you lost 15 pounds.

02:08.567 --> 02:11.100
-Thank you, Sophia.
-Oh, that's your thigh.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.066
I thought it was part
of the couch.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.834
Blanche, try to remember,
gravy isn't a beverage.

02:20.000 --> 02:23.333
Blanche, ma broke her glasses.
She can't see a thing.

02:24.333 --> 02:27.033
-Hi, Rose.
-Hi, Rose.

02:27.100 --> 02:29.000
What's the matter?
Something wrong?

02:29.066 --> 02:31.533
Yes. No.

02:31.600 --> 02:35.734
-Well, I guess yes and no.
-Honey, what is it?

02:36.667 --> 02:40.767
I found out this morning
I'm going to be a mother again.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.967
Rose, we've been over this.

02:43.033 --> 02:46.200
You cannot get pregnant
using the toilet at the mall.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.200
I'll bet it's a boy.

02:50.266 --> 02:52.934
You're carrying really high
and in front.

02:55.066 --> 02:58.300
I'm not having a baby,
I'm getting a baby.

02:58.367 --> 03:03.700
My uncle Hingablotter passed away
and left me custody of his baby.

03:03.767 --> 03:07.500
-Oh, my God.
-What will you do?

03:07.567 --> 03:09.100
I'm not sure.

03:09.166 --> 03:11.934
I've always dreamed
of being a mother again,

03:12.000 --> 03:13.867
but it's a big responsibility.

03:13.934 --> 03:15.467
Oh, it sure is.

03:15.533 --> 03:17.834
I couldn't raise another baby
at my age,

03:17.900 --> 03:20.633
and I'm far younger than you.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.867
And prettier.

03:22.934 --> 03:26.166
Not that prettier has anything
to do with it, but I just am.

03:28.667 --> 03:29.867
You...

03:32.600 --> 03:34.767
you know, Rose,
I have a confession to make.

03:34.834 --> 03:39.100
I've always dreamed of the chance
to raise another baby.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.300
Well, Dorothy, if you're lucky,

03:41.367 --> 03:44.533
maybe someday one of your uncles
will drop dead.

03:44.600 --> 03:48.266
I mean,
if you decide to raise this child,

03:48.333 --> 03:50.233
I'd like to help you.

03:50.300 --> 03:51.300
Really?

03:51.367 --> 03:54.467
If you both want
to raise this child,

03:54.533 --> 03:57.133
I might consider it myself.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.867
You said you'd hate
being a mother.

03:59.934 --> 04:02.066
I meant by myself.

04:02.133 --> 04:07.066
If you all change its diapers
and clean up whenever it pees,

04:07.133 --> 04:09.133
I'd love being a mother again.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.166
Are you sure about this?

04:11.233 --> 04:17.800
It'll be lots of work, but it'd be
worth it to hear a baby's laugh.

04:17.867 --> 04:20.400
-Oh, let's do it.
-How about it, Ma?

04:20.467 --> 04:23.533
If I say no,
I'll be back at the home.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.433
Building log cabins
out of popsicle sticks.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.433
I'll have the lawyer
bring the baby.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.333
A boy or a girl?

04:32.400 --> 04:35.467
He didn't say.
It's probably one or the other.

04:35.533 --> 04:38.633
You been watching
PBS again, Rose?

04:39.533 --> 04:43.367
Dorothy? Dorothy,
I'm going to my bedroom.

04:43.433 --> 04:45.533
I want to lie down for a while.

04:52.467 --> 04:54.433
(tires screech)

04:54.500 --> 04:56.934
-(car horn honks)
-Ma?

04:57.433 --> 04:58.400
Dorothy!

04:58.467 --> 05:00.800
Who the hell parked
a Buick in my bedroom?

05:23.033 --> 05:24.533
Sophia!

05:26.300 --> 05:28.767
Rose. What are you doing
in the bathroom?

05:31.300 --> 05:32.867
Ma, this is the kitchen.

05:32.934 --> 05:38.000
Oh, boy. If this is the kitchen,
I'm poaching an egg in the toilet.

05:45.734 --> 05:48.433
Dorothy, look at this
old picture I found.

05:48.500 --> 05:51.633
That's me at 15 standing next
to my uncle Hingablotter.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.166
Who's the other guy?

05:53.233 --> 05:55.834
Oh, that's my uncle's
half-brother, Inkablotter.

06:00.900 --> 06:03.700
-Oh, girls, we have a big problem.
-What, Blanche?

06:03.767 --> 06:05.433
-We're all women.
-No!

06:05.500 --> 06:07.934
-We are.
-Oh, shut up, Rose!

06:11.100 --> 06:13.500
This Spock book on baby care says

06:13.567 --> 06:17.467
it's important for a child
to have a male role model.

06:17.533 --> 06:18.767
What will we do?

06:18.834 --> 06:20.300
We'll all wear yankee caps

06:20.367 --> 06:23.100
and scratch our behinds
after every beer.

06:27.867 --> 06:30.533
Blanche,
we don't have to worry.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.834
If we give that baby love,
attention, and understanding,

06:33.900 --> 06:35.066
it'll turn out fine.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.033
That's beautiful.

06:37.100 --> 06:40.300
Besides, what does Spock know
about raising babies?

06:40.367 --> 06:43.266
On Vulcan,
the kids are born in pods.

06:48.767 --> 06:50.834
Rose, I know this
is a long shot,

06:50.900 --> 06:54.533
but did you take much acid
during the sixties?

06:56.533 --> 06:58.500
(doorbell rings)

07:04.166 --> 07:07.700
-Is Rose Nylund here?
-I'm Rose Nylund.

07:07.767 --> 07:10.133
I'm Chester T. McRainey,

07:10.200 --> 07:12.967
legal counsel to your
late uncle Hingablotter.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.200
We've been waiting for you.

07:15.266 --> 07:17.400
-Did you bring the baby?
-I brought him.

07:17.467 --> 07:19.033
Him. Did you
hear that, girls?

07:19.100 --> 07:21.367
Does he look
anything like me?

07:21.433 --> 07:24.000
Well, judge for yourself.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.934
Come on, baby.

07:38.600 --> 07:42.433
Well... maybe just a little
around the eyes.

07:44.367 --> 07:47.200
What in hell is going on here?

07:47.266 --> 07:50.900
This is baby,
five times blue ribbon winner

07:50.967 --> 07:52.767
at the Minnesota State Fair.

07:52.834 --> 07:56.066
This was your uncle's
pride and joy.

07:56.133 --> 07:57.400
Oh, my God.

07:57.467 --> 07:59.667
That's the cutest baby
I've ever seen.

08:01.667 --> 08:02.867
Ma, it's a pig!

08:02.934 --> 08:07.000
You were no great looker
when I brought you home,

08:07.066 --> 08:08.767
but I loved you anyway.

08:08.834 --> 08:14.333
Well, he sure is cute.
Come here, baby.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.266
I haven't had a pig
as a pet since--

08:17.333 --> 08:18.633
Just forget that, Rose.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.567
Get that filthy beast
out of my house.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.500
Fine.

08:22.567 --> 08:25.533
Your cousin Gunter will
be happy to take baby.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.734
And the $100,000
that comes along with him.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.667
I beg your pardon?

08:30.734 --> 08:33.934
Uncle Hingablotter
was a very rich man,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.066
and he loved this pig dearly.

08:36.133 --> 08:39.166
That's why he left you $100,000

08:39.233 --> 08:41.667
to make sure baby
would be cared for.

08:41.734 --> 08:44.767
-I'd do it for free.
-Shut up, Rose.

08:47.033 --> 08:51.400
How long does Rose have to care for
it before she gets the money?

08:51.467 --> 08:54.000
-As long as he lives.
-Forget it.

08:54.066 --> 08:57.100
-We'd split the money.
-Forget it.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.367
-How long does a pig live?
-25 years.

08:59.433 --> 09:00.600
Forget it.

09:00.667 --> 09:01.834
How old is baby?

09:01.900 --> 09:02.900
29.

09:02.967 --> 09:05.500
Welcome, baby!

09:20.400 --> 09:21.667
Hi, Dorothy.

09:25.533 --> 09:26.734
Hi, Ma.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.200
Dorothy, how do you
make your voice do that?

09:30.767 --> 09:32.567
I picked up
your new glasses.

09:32.633 --> 09:35.834
Oh, thank God.
Now I can see.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.367
Wait. These are no good.

09:37.433 --> 09:40.333
-They're the wrong prescription?
-No, the wrong frames.

09:40.400 --> 09:44.166
I specifically asked
for old lady smoky gray.

09:44.233 --> 09:46.333
These are black.
I look like buddy holly.

09:48.300 --> 09:49.700
There you are.

09:49.767 --> 09:54.166
Get inside and eat your slop
before I spank that pink fanny.

09:54.233 --> 09:56.467
All right, I'm going.

09:59.500 --> 10:03.400
That's how they called us
for dinner at the home.

10:03.467 --> 10:06.900
Now, go on, baby,
go on, go on.

10:06.967 --> 10:11.166
I thought we decided
that pig would stay out back.

10:11.233 --> 10:12.533
He didn't like it there.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.100
It was too confining.

10:14.166 --> 10:19.066
Baby's a free spirit,
a wanderer, a rebel.

10:19.133 --> 10:21.900
In a lot of ways,
he reminds me of Jimmy dean.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.900
The actor or the sausage?

10:31.567 --> 10:33.800
You know, I was thinking,

10:33.867 --> 10:38.200
how wonderful it is
having a pig live here.

10:40.700 --> 10:44.900
This morning
when I opened my eyes,

10:44.967 --> 10:47.700
and there was baby fast asleep

10:47.767 --> 10:50.467
at the foot of the bed
like a sweet angel.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.166
That is sweet.

10:53.233 --> 10:56.300
Rose, how long do you think
it'll be before the pig is dead?

11:00.633 --> 11:03.467
-Did baby do something wrong?
-Oh, no. No.

11:03.533 --> 11:06.000
Not unless you count the fact
that when he burps,

11:06.066 --> 11:09.800
it smells like four burning tires.

11:11.767 --> 11:13.900
Girls, I'm just so mad!

11:13.967 --> 11:16.400
That pig tore up my nightgown
last night.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.967
Blanche, the people you date
are from foreign countries.

11:19.033 --> 11:21.066
They play by different rules.

11:22.934 --> 11:24.834
I'm talking about baby.

11:24.900 --> 11:28.266
I never should've let that filthy
barnyard beast in my house at all.

11:28.333 --> 11:31.533
He ruins my clothes,
smells up the house,

11:31.600 --> 11:33.767
and he likes to watch me shower.

11:35.300 --> 11:37.633
He's a pig.
There's no accounting for taste.

11:42.133 --> 11:45.133
I didn't realize baby
was such an inconvenience.

11:45.200 --> 11:46.667
I'm sorry.

11:46.734 --> 11:48.900
I'll call my relatives

11:48.967 --> 11:52.467
and see if somebody can
take him off my hands.

11:52.533 --> 11:54.600
Him and the $100,000.

11:54.667 --> 11:58.333
-The pig is going to drop any day.
-Rose!

11:58.400 --> 12:00.700
Come back here, honey.

12:00.767 --> 12:03.667
I guess I was a little too hasty.

12:03.734 --> 12:05.433
Baby isn't really
all that much trouble.

12:05.500 --> 12:09.500
Heck, this is an old nightgown.
He's kind of cute.

12:09.567 --> 12:11.800
And he's not the first pig
to watch you shower.

12:11.867 --> 12:13.834
That's my last pig joke.

12:19.333 --> 12:22.767
-Then it's okay? He can stay?
-Of course.

12:22.834 --> 12:25.800
I'll tell him the good news.

12:25.867 --> 12:29.900
I have to work tomorrow.
Can somebody give baby his lunch?

12:31.667 --> 12:34.100
-I won't do it.
-Why not?

12:34.166 --> 12:36.667
Because you two
are making me sick,

12:36.734 --> 12:39.033
degrading yourself
by living with a filthy animal.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.867
And for what? Money.

12:40.934 --> 12:42.767
It's humiliating.
I don't want any part of it.

12:44.934 --> 12:46.967
-What if we cut you in?
-What time does he eat?

12:49.166 --> 12:52.233
Girls! Girls! Come quick!
Baby just collapsed!

12:54.467 --> 12:57.266
25 grand in 10 seconds?

12:57.333 --> 12:59.533
Now I know how
Johnny Carson feels.

13:12.066 --> 13:13.400
Poor baby.

13:13.467 --> 13:15.300
This morning
he was so full of life.

13:15.367 --> 13:18.600
-Now he looks just terrible.
-Rose, don't torture yourself.

13:18.667 --> 13:21.233
Baby is very, very old.

13:21.300 --> 13:25.133
Whenever one of God's creatures
outlives its normal life expectancy,

13:25.200 --> 13:27.033
it can go at any minute.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.300
Would you mind not looking at me
when you say that?

13:32.967 --> 13:35.467
Does anybody know
where the thermometer is?

13:35.533 --> 13:37.433
In the medicine cabinet. Why?

13:37.500 --> 13:39.533
I want to take
baby's temperature,

13:39.600 --> 13:42.934
although I'm not sure what
a pig's normal temperature is.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.800
I know a ham
turns out nicely at 325.

13:47.033 --> 13:48.500
Oh...

13:50.867 --> 13:53.767
I'm sorry, Rose.
I don't know what I'm saying.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.734
I'm delirious with grief.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.333
So, Dorothy,

14:02.400 --> 14:04.433
what are you gonna do
with your share of the money?

14:04.500 --> 14:08.133
Oh, come on, Blanche,
the pig isn't dead, he's sick.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.033
I mean, the money never
crossed my mind.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.500
Oh, yeah?
Then what were you doing

14:11.567 --> 14:13.533
with these E.F. Hutton brochures?

14:14.033 --> 14:15.433
Ma, you took those
out of my purse.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.967
No, no, they fell out
when I was taking out a 20.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.500
Well, I'm sure not putting
my money into stocks and bonds.

14:22.567 --> 14:25.834
Hey, this is found money.
This is fun money.

14:25.900 --> 14:29.233
This is hot beaches
and sweaty men money.

14:29.300 --> 14:32.567
This is getting naked and
roll around on the ground money.

14:32.633 --> 14:35.734
Even your money
has more fun than I do.

14:44.467 --> 14:47.800
-Boy, it's great being rich.
-Oh.

14:47.867 --> 14:51.266
I cannot believe we spent so much
money we don't have yet.

14:51.333 --> 14:54.066
Relax. When I looked in
on baby earlier,

14:54.133 --> 14:56.100
he was a half-hour
away from sizzlean.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.800
Oh... Rose Nylund,
shame on you.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.800
A gentleman caller
in the afternoon.

15:03.867 --> 15:07.467
No. He's a veterinarian.
He was here to see baby.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.000
-Oh.
-Oh.

15:09.066 --> 15:10.633
How is baby, doc?

15:10.700 --> 15:13.467
I read in <i>Newsweek</i>
they ran him out of Haiti.

15:16.767 --> 15:19.600
-How is baby?
-Not very well.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.934
I don't think
he has much time left.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.567
Oh, that's too bad.

15:23.633 --> 15:25.033
-Tragic.
-Terrible.

15:25.100 --> 15:27.633
-There's hope.
-What?

15:27.700 --> 15:31.033
There's really nothing wrong
with baby physically.

15:31.100 --> 15:32.734
His problem is mental.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.800
Four grown women
decide to live with a pig,

15:35.867 --> 15:38.066
and he's the one
with the mental problem?

15:39.967 --> 15:43.100
I wouldn't exactly
call it a mental problem.

15:43.166 --> 15:46.166
When you take an animal out
of its natural environment,

15:46.233 --> 15:50.467
it has a hard time
adjusting to new surroundings.

15:50.533 --> 15:55.000
Are you trying to tell us that
pig is dying of homesickness?

15:55.066 --> 15:56.400
In a way, yes.

15:56.467 --> 15:58.934
I recommend you get him
back to the farm.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.467
He'll do better there.

16:01.533 --> 16:03.500
Thank you very much, doctor.

16:03.567 --> 16:06.867
I guess we have no choice.

16:06.934 --> 16:08.834
I'll call my relatives in Minnesota

16:08.900 --> 16:11.000
and make arrangements
to send baby back.

16:11.066 --> 16:12.266
-You can't do that.
-No!

16:12.333 --> 16:15.433
I'm as disappointed as you.

16:15.500 --> 16:19.567
It's been great having
a pig living in the house,

16:19.633 --> 16:22.567
but we can't jeopardize
baby's health. The doctor said so.

16:22.633 --> 16:25.767
What does he know?
He's not a real doctor.

16:25.834 --> 16:28.767
He makes his living sticking
thermometers up a cat's behind.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.934
He seemed pretty sure.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.100
Doctors can make mistakes too.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.467
We should send baby home.

16:38.533 --> 16:41.667
Do you realize
how far away home is?

16:41.734 --> 16:45.166
Baby is sick.
The plane trip alone could kill him.

16:45.233 --> 16:47.400
Even if he got home safely,

16:47.467 --> 16:49.500
who knows what kind
of care he'd get?

16:49.567 --> 16:52.000
Nobody loves him
as much as you do.

16:52.066 --> 16:53.700
As much as we all do.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.633
If you all think it's best for him,
I guess he should stay.

16:58.700 --> 17:02.066
Thank you for caring so much.

17:02.133 --> 17:04.967
And that poor, sick,
helpless pig in there

17:05.033 --> 17:06.800
appreciates what
you're doing too.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.834
I'm going to look in on baby.

17:08.900 --> 17:12.467
You're the best friends
I've ever had.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.734
I feel terrible.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.867
I feel miserable.

17:18.934 --> 17:20.266
Let's go shopping.

17:30.767 --> 17:31.700
Hi, Dorothy.

17:31.767 --> 17:35.467
Blanche, Blanche,
I'm so glad you came back.

17:35.533 --> 17:37.033
I have to talk to you.

17:37.100 --> 17:40.066
I have to talk to you too.
It's about the money.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.800
Exactly what I wanted to talk about.

17:42.867 --> 17:44.200
I've been so worried.

17:44.266 --> 17:47.333
The way we've been
spending is wrong.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.967
I couldn't agree with you more.

17:50.033 --> 17:51.967
I've been up half the night

17:52.033 --> 17:54.867
worrying about how
foolish we've been

17:54.934 --> 17:59.033
spending all that money on silly
little things that we don't need.

17:59.100 --> 18:01.600
I am so relieved.

18:01.667 --> 18:04.934
I knew you would agree
that combining our money

18:05.000 --> 18:07.633
to buy one big thing
was the best idea.

18:08.867 --> 18:12.066
I just hope you like it
in light blue.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.767
Like what in light blue?

18:13.834 --> 18:17.700
-(horn honks)
-We'll be right out, Sophia.

18:17.767 --> 18:18.967
Blanche, that's a Mercedes.

18:19.033 --> 18:22.467
I know. Don't you love it?
It's ours.

18:22.533 --> 18:27.000
Blanche, I wanted to give up
the money and send baby home.

18:27.066 --> 18:28.667
You can't do that.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.600
We lied to Rose.

18:30.667 --> 18:35.200
We tricked her into jeopardizing an
animal's life to make a fast buck.

18:35.266 --> 18:37.433
We have to tell her the truth.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.200
I cannot let you do this.

18:39.266 --> 18:40.567
Blanche, get out of my way.

18:40.633 --> 18:43.166
I want that car.
I'll give you anything.

18:43.233 --> 18:45.066
We have to tell the truth.

18:45.133 --> 18:46.734
I'll give you one of my sons.

18:49.867 --> 18:52.900
I've given this a lot of thought.
I've had four kids.

18:52.967 --> 18:55.734
I've never had a Mercedes.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.967
Which one do you want,
Biff, Doug, Skippy?

18:58.033 --> 18:59.867
No. Don't take skippy.
He's got asthma.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.500
This has gone far enough.

19:07.467 --> 19:08.934
(knock on door)

19:10.567 --> 19:13.033
Rose.
Honey, I want to talk to you.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.867
-Don't bother Rose. She's busy.
-Oh, it's okay.

19:15.934 --> 19:18.767
I was just thumbing
through the family album.

19:20.066 --> 19:22.533
Here's baby
when he was younger.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.367
Wasn't he an impressive sight?

19:24.433 --> 19:26.367
Yes, Rose.

19:26.433 --> 19:30.100
But then again, who isn't
when he's caught relieving himself

19:30.166 --> 19:32.400
and eating dinner
at the same time?

19:35.667 --> 19:39.734
Well, I think baby looks
a whole lot better today.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.633
A pig isn't supposed
to be green, Blanche.

19:42.700 --> 19:43.934
Oh.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.166
Rose, I have a confession to make.

19:46.233 --> 19:48.834
When I said that baby
shouldn't go back,

19:48.900 --> 19:52.433
I wasn't thinking of him.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.934
I was acting out of greed.
I wanted the money.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.800
Dorothy, I am shocked.

20:01.800 --> 20:06.066
So am I.
I can't believe you lied to me.

20:06.133 --> 20:08.533
Don't be too hard on her.

20:08.600 --> 20:10.533
She may have done it
for the wrong reason,

20:10.600 --> 20:14.433
but the decision was right.
Baby is better off here.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.166
Don't look at me
like I'm a murderer.

20:18.233 --> 20:20.700
This pig's dying
because he's old and sick.

20:20.767 --> 20:23.066
I refuse to entertain the notion

20:23.133 --> 20:26.800
that he's homesick
for this God-forsaken place.

20:26.867 --> 20:30.233
(oinks)

20:30.300 --> 20:31.500
What's going on?

20:31.567 --> 20:35.300
I think he recognizes the picture of
uncle Hingablotter's farm.

20:35.367 --> 20:36.967
Oh, my God.

20:37.033 --> 20:39.333
Then he is homesick.

20:39.400 --> 20:41.533
I'm a murderer.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.033
I'm nothing but no-good,
money-grubbing trash.

20:44.100 --> 20:46.033
I beg you, forgive me.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.934
Get a hold of yourself.

20:49.433 --> 20:51.533
Rose, I apologize.

20:51.600 --> 20:54.200
Rose, so do I.

20:54.266 --> 20:58.033
Oh, Rose,
can you ever forgive us?

21:00.567 --> 21:03.033
Rose.

21:05.066 --> 21:05.834
I don't know.

21:05.900 --> 21:09.433
Oh, honey, please.
We're really sorry.

21:11.233 --> 21:15.333
I might forgive you,
but I can't speak for baby.

21:15.400 --> 21:19.033
Is there something
we can do to smooth things over?

21:20.133 --> 21:23.734
Well... a kiss on the nose
might be a nice gesture.

21:33.400 --> 21:37.166
Oh, I never can stay mad
at you silly gooses.

21:38.133 --> 21:39.333
What's going on?

21:39.400 --> 21:42.400
Oh, Ma, baby's going home?

21:42.467 --> 21:44.367
Oh, may he rest in peace.

21:44.433 --> 21:47.333
Ma, baby isn't dead.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.567
We've decided to send him
back to the farm

21:49.633 --> 21:51.300
and give up the money.

21:51.800 --> 21:55.233
Wait a minute,
let me get this straight.

21:55.300 --> 21:57.433
We lived with a filthy pig
in our house,

21:57.500 --> 22:00.467
put a whole bunch of stuff
on credit we can't afford,

22:00.533 --> 22:02.600
and now we're gonna kiss off
100,000 bucks

22:02.667 --> 22:06.567
-because the pig is homesick?
-That's right.

22:06.633 --> 22:09.967
Sometimes life
really bites the big one.

22:20.133 --> 22:22.000
Hi, Sophia.

22:22.066 --> 22:24.100
You got your new glasses.

22:24.166 --> 22:29.500
Yeah. I also got these to beg
for spare change on the corner.

22:29.567 --> 22:30.700
That is enough!

22:30.767 --> 22:33.467
We have to stop this
moping around.

22:33.533 --> 22:35.567
We don't have
the money anymore.

22:35.633 --> 22:38.967
We still have a great deal
to be thankful for.

22:39.033 --> 22:40.734
We live in a lovely home.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.867
We have our health
and each other.

22:42.934 --> 22:47.433
When we had the money,
we did ridiculous things.

22:47.500 --> 22:49.000
I'm glad it's gone.

22:49.066 --> 22:52.767
My cousin who took baby
just sent us a letter.

22:52.834 --> 22:54.600
Please let there be cash in it!

22:54.667 --> 22:57.600
I can't stand being poor
another day!

22:57.667 --> 22:59.100
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:02.266 --> 23:03.567
"Dear Rose,

23:03.633 --> 23:06.767
just wanted to let you know
baby arrived safely.

23:06.834 --> 23:09.700
He was really happy
to be back.

23:09.767 --> 23:13.333
His last 36 hours
on this good earth..."

23:13.400 --> 23:16.266
What... what?

23:16.333 --> 23:18.600
Baby died.

23:19.800 --> 23:21.233
Poor baby.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.667
Poor baby?

23:23.734 --> 23:28.066
I guess he wasn't homesick
after all, just old.

23:28.133 --> 23:30.834
For this, I fought my way
back from a stroke?

23:33.600 --> 23:35.767
I cannot believe this.

23:35.834 --> 23:39.700
If he'd stayed here another
lousy day and a half, we'd be rich.

23:39.767 --> 23:40.900
(horn honks)

23:40.967 --> 23:42.300
What was that?

23:43.500 --> 23:45.266
Oh, no!

23:45.333 --> 23:48.333
They've come to tow away
our Mercedes.

23:48.400 --> 23:52.233
Oh, now I am really depressed.

23:52.300 --> 23:56.400
I never even got
a chance to ride in it.

23:56.467 --> 23:58.400
(Dorothy)
What a great idea.

23:58.467 --> 24:00.166
(Blanche)
Isn't it luxurious?

24:00.233 --> 24:02.100
(Rose)
The engine's so quiet.

24:03.600 --> 24:04.900
(Sophia)
There's Gladys Feinbaum.

24:04.967 --> 24:07.066
Look at her, green with envy.

24:07.133 --> 24:09.200
Eat your heart out, Feinbaum!

24:14.533 --> 24:17.300
(theme music playing)
