WEBVTT

00:04.438 --> 00:05.039
HURRY UP. COME ON.

00:05.073 --> 00:05.773
GET A MOVE ON.
WE'RE LATE.

00:05.806 --> 00:08.076
YOU CAN'T BE LATE
TO A FUNERAL.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.343
SEAN?
YEAH, BABY?

00:09.377 --> 00:10.544
DID YOU SEE THIS?

00:10.578 --> 00:12.146
IT'S THE CONDOLENCE
CARD.

00:12.180 --> 00:13.347
HENRY WROTE,
"GET WELL SOON."

00:13.381 --> 00:14.382
OH. UH...

00:14.415 --> 00:16.617
THERE ARE OTHER CARDS
IN THE DRAWER, AREN'T THERE?

00:16.650 --> 00:18.686
I'M GOIN' OUT
TO THE CAR.

00:19.820 --> 00:23.157
MOM, I THINK MY SUIT
IS WAY TOO SMALL.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.092
YEAH. ME, TOO.

00:24.125 --> 00:24.892
THEY'RE--
THEY'RE FINE.

00:24.925 --> 00:26.760
WE'LL--WE'LL JUST--
HERE, WE'LL JUST

00:26.794 --> 00:29.363
PULL YOUR SLEEVE
DOWN A LITTLE.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.202
JIMMY, GIVE HENRY
YOUR SUIT JACKET.

00:34.235 --> 00:35.169
WELL, THEN, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

00:35.203 --> 00:37.238
Y-YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE HENRY'S JACKET
AND JUST--

00:37.271 --> 00:39.273
JUST SLING IT CASUALLY
OVER YOUR SHOULDER.

00:39.307 --> 00:42.643
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
MY PANTS?

00:42.676 --> 00:43.411
YOU WANT ME
TO CASUALLY

00:43.444 --> 00:45.546
SLING THOSE
OVER MY SHOULDER, TOO?

00:45.579 --> 00:48.516
PUT ON
YOUR BLACK JEANS. GO.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.817
NO, NO, NO, NO.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.619
WHY ARE THEY GOING
UPSTAIRS?!

00:51.652 --> 00:52.586
TO CHANGE THEIR CLOTHES!

00:52.620 --> 00:54.822
COME ON, WE ARE LATE!
LET'S GET A MOVE ON IT.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.357
WHY DO I HAVE TO GO
TO THIS FUNERAL?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.292
I BARELY EVEN REMEMBER
COUSIN SCOTT.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.793
'CAUSE SCOTT AND I
GREW UP TOGETHER.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.129
HE WAS A GREAT GUY.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.630
WELL, HE WASN'T
VERY SMART.

01:02.663 --> 01:03.397
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

01:03.431 --> 01:06.100
HE SNOWBOARDED
OUT OF A HELICOPTER

01:06.134 --> 01:06.934
ONTO A GLACIER

01:06.967 --> 01:08.869
AND THEN OFF THE EDGE
OF THE GLACIER.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.871
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
MADE SCOTT GREAT.

01:10.904 --> 01:14.275
I MEAN, HE LIVED LIFE
TO THE FULLEST.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.778
LIGHT 'EM UP!

01:18.446 --> 01:20.614
WHOO-HOO!
Sean: COME ON!

01:20.648 --> 01:23.751
GO! GO!
GO! GO!

01:27.788 --> 01:29.223
OH, SEAN!

01:29.257 --> 01:32.160
YOU GOTTA
TRY THIS, MAN.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.761
I REALLY DON'T.

01:33.794 --> 01:36.130
HUH!

01:36.164 --> 01:38.632
IT WAS LIKE
A LITTLE GNARLY
LITTLE MONKEY-DOG.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.569
A SHARK JUST SWAM UP
AND BIT YOUR BOARD?

01:41.602 --> 01:44.238
NO, NOT JUST
MY BOARD.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.273
READY?

01:45.306 --> 01:47.208
HUH?!

01:47.241 --> 01:50.444
HUH?!

01:50.478 --> 01:52.280
HE JUST TOOK
A CHUNK!

01:52.313 --> 01:54.282
I--I WAS, "PBBBT!"

01:54.315 --> 01:55.616
YOU GOTTA COME
OUT THERE WITH ME,
SEAN.

01:55.649 --> 01:59.153
ABSOLUTELY. DEFINITELY.
ONE OF THESE DAYS, YEAH.

01:59.187 --> 02:01.689
NO. TODAY IS ONE
OF THESE DAYS.

02:01.722 --> 02:02.423
NO, IT'S NOT.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.258
ALL RIGHT.
SO, YOU PAY ATTENTION,

02:04.292 --> 02:05.359
'CAUSE YOU'RE NEXT,
ALL RIGHT?

02:05.393 --> 02:08.462
ALL RIGHT!

02:14.302 --> 02:16.204
WHOO-HOO!

02:16.237 --> 02:19.307
WHOO! YEAH!

02:19.340 --> 02:20.741
Scott:
WHOO-HOO!

02:20.774 --> 02:21.942
I'M GONNA GO GET
MY SUNBLOCK.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.811
YOU'RE NOT COMING BACK,
ARE YOU?

02:23.844 --> 02:24.845
HELL NO.

02:24.878 --> 02:25.679
GUYS...

02:25.713 --> 02:29.250
THIS IS THE PART
WHERE YOU PULL ME UP!

02:29.283 --> 02:30.551
WELL, IF YOU TWO
ARE SO CLOSE,

02:30.584 --> 02:32.320
HOW COME I DIDN'T
SEE HIM MORE?

02:32.353 --> 02:34.288
WELL, SCOTT AND I TOOK
SEPARATE PATHS IN LIFE.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.122
HE SPENT
THE LAST 10 YEARS

02:35.155 --> 02:37.191
CLIMBING THE WORLD'S
TALLEST MOUNTAINS,

02:37.225 --> 02:38.125
AND I SPENT
THE LAST 10 YEARS

02:38.158 --> 02:41.929
TRYING TO GET CHILDREN
INTO THE CAR!

02:41.962 --> 02:42.896
COME ON!

02:42.930 --> 02:45.233
BABE, THIS IS THE ONLY
OTHER CARD I COULD FIND.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.767
THAT'S GOT
A BABY'S BUTT ON IT.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.737
BUT SEE, THAT--THAT
SHOULD CHEER HIM UP,
RIGHT?

02:49.770 --> 02:50.538
BABY BUTT!

02:50.571 --> 02:51.405
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
SIGN MY NAME.

02:51.439 --> 02:54.875
I'M IN THE CAR.
I'M GOING OUT THE DOOR.

02:54.908 --> 02:59.247
I AM ACTUALLY
IN THE CAR!

03:00.681 --> 03:01.749
BABY, WHERE ARE MY KEYS?

03:01.782 --> 03:04.485
UH, UPSTAIRS
ON THE DRESSER.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.519
CAN YOU GET 'EM
FOR ME?

03:05.553 --> 03:06.720
WHY CAN'T YOU
GO GET 'EM?

03:06.754 --> 03:09.423
WELL, THEY THINK
I'M IN THE CAR.

03:09.457 --> 03:11.459
OK, COME ON, GUYS.
LET'S GET GOING.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.327
HEY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE IN THE CAR.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.262
WELL, I WAS, OK?

03:14.295 --> 03:14.995
BUT IT TOOK YOU GUYS
SO LONG

03:15.028 --> 03:16.664
THAT I HAD
TO COME BACK INSIDE,

03:16.697 --> 03:18.866
AND NOW I GOTTA GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

03:18.899 --> 03:19.900
SEAN, CO--

03:19.933 --> 03:21.735
OK, I'M GONNA GO PLAY
A VIDEO GAME.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.337
NO!
NO!

03:43.591 --> 03:44.525
I'M BORED.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.695
HENRY, WE--
WE JUST GOT HERE.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.363
JUST BEIN' HONEST.

03:49.397 --> 03:53.367
WELL, PLEASE BE QUIET.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.837
WHEN ARE WE LEAVING?

03:56.870 --> 03:58.539
SHH!

03:58.572 --> 03:59.873
AH, GOOD. YOU'RE HERE.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.376
JIMMY,
PUT ON YOUR JACKET.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.912
AW, TAKE IT OFF.

04:05.413 --> 04:07.815
OK, LOOK, I KNOW
THEY NEED NEW SUITS.

04:07.848 --> 04:11.452
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS
HAVE FUNERAL CLOTHES
READY TO GO.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.353
I KNOW. I KNOW.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.655
I'M JUST SAYING
I LEARNED IT THE HARD WAY

04:14.688 --> 04:16.790
AT UNCLE PETE'S FUNERAL.

04:18.692 --> 04:21.595
I'M VERY SORRY,
AUNT EDNA.

04:21.629 --> 04:24.998
IT'S ALL I HAD.
SORRY.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.568
SHE SAID I COULDN'T
BE A PALLBEARER

04:27.601 --> 04:30.538
BECAUSE I LOOKED
LIKE TONY ORLANDO.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.007
COUSIN SCOTT
IS IN THERE?

04:34.041 --> 04:36.344
YEAH.
HE'S BEEN CREMATED.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.946
THEY TURN HIM
INTO CREAM?!

04:38.979 --> 04:42.483
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
LEAVE THAT ALONE.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.517
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

04:43.551 --> 04:46.454
YOU GUYS GO
GIVE YOUR CONDOLENCES
TO AUNT BETTY.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.755
WH-WHICH ONE'S
AUNT BETTY?

04:47.788 --> 04:48.556
OVER THERE.
SHE'S THE ONE

04:48.589 --> 04:50.424
WHO LOOKS LIKE SHE
ATE THE LIPSTICK.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.493
SCOOT.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.728
Walt: AH, SCOTT.

04:54.762 --> 04:57.064
DO YOU SMELL SOMETHING?

04:57.097 --> 04:58.098
NO.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.867
YOU DON'T SMELL COFFEE?

04:59.900 --> 05:01.802
NO.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.705
HEY. WHAT--
OH, MY GOD!

05:04.738 --> 05:05.773
IT'S FULL OF
COFFEE GRINDS!

05:05.806 --> 05:06.674
ARE YOU SERIOUS?!

05:06.707 --> 05:08.342
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.
WE'VE GOTTA GO TALK

05:08.376 --> 05:09.377
TO THE FUNERAL DIRECTOR.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.811
WAIT, DAD.
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT
TO MAKE A SCENE?

05:10.844 --> 05:12.780
I MEAN, AREN'T PEOPLE
UPSET ENOUGH ALREADY?

05:12.813 --> 05:13.814
HOW CAN YOU BE SO CALM?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.883
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST THINK
THESE KINDS OF THINGS

05:15.916 --> 05:18.519
PROBABLY HAPPEN
MORE OFTEN THAN
WE REALIZE.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.653
MM-HMM.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.823
THIS IS COFFEE,
FOR PETE'S SAKE!

05:23.524 --> 05:26.126
THESE PEOPLE ARE MOURNING
A POT OF COFFEE!

05:26.159 --> 05:27.895
SHH!

05:27.928 --> 05:29.697
OH, GOD.
IT'S OK, CLAUDIA.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.565
NO, NO, NO.
I'M NOT SURE
THAT IT IS.

05:31.599 --> 05:32.433
CLAUD--
OH...

05:32.466 --> 05:34.001
IT WAS YOU.
YOU DID IT!

05:34.034 --> 05:35.836
CHILL OUT, DAD.
I WILL NOT.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.405
YOU'RE MAKING A SCENE.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.472
YOU'RE GRAVE ROBBERS.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.073
WE ARE NOT
GRAVE ROBBERS.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.376
HI.
AAH.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.777
OH, SEAN,

05:43.811 --> 05:44.412
CLAUDIA.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.979
I AM SO HAPPY
TO SEE YOU.

05:46.013 --> 05:49.850
THE--THE FLOWERS--
THEY ARE SO LOVELY.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.118
YES.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.495
ARE YOU OK?

06:01.529 --> 06:02.830
NO.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.798
WHAT'S WRONG?

06:04.832 --> 06:08.068
SCOTT'S DEAD.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.539
OH, RIGHT.

06:11.572 --> 06:15.809
UH, UM...I'M LILY.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.646
JEFF.

06:19.112 --> 06:23.016
DO--DO YOU WANT
A TISSUE?

06:23.917 --> 06:27.688
THAT'S NOT SNOT.
IT'S GUM.

06:29.056 --> 06:30.658
THANK YOU.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.663
I HAVE SOME GUM,
IF YOU NEED SOME.

06:35.696 --> 06:40.701
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'S GONE.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.906
IT'LL BE OK.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.909
I GOT THE
COLD CUT PLATTER
AT MAZZARINO'S.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.844
IT WAS VERY,
VERY GOOD.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.714
I LOVE THE BABY PICKLES.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.882
DO YOU SMELL COFFEE?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.850
NO!
YOU CRAZY?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.051
WELL, WHERE'S IT
COMING FROM?

06:58.085 --> 07:01.889
MARIE, HAVE YOU KISSED
JIMMY AND HENRY YET?

07:01.922 --> 07:04.625
OH, NO. WHERE ARE
THE LITTLE DUMPLINGS?

07:04.658 --> 07:05.993
OH, I SEE YOU.

07:06.026 --> 07:09.697
YOU COME
GIVE AUNT MARIE
A BIG HUG.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.199
WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU DO?!

07:12.232 --> 07:13.867
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

07:13.901 --> 07:14.968
NO BIG DEAL?

07:15.002 --> 07:17.237
YOU SECRETLY
REPLACED THE REMAINS
OF YOUR DEAD COUSIN

07:17.270 --> 07:19.006
WITH FOLGERS CRYSTALS!

07:19.039 --> 07:20.641
LOOK, SCOTT WAS
ALL ABOUT LIFE,

07:20.674 --> 07:24.011
AND LOOK AT THIS PLACE--
EVERYBODY SAD AND WEEPING.

07:24.044 --> 07:24.778
IT'S DEPRESSING.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.748
IT'S A FUNERAL,
NOT A TAFFY PULL.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.883
SCOTT WOULD HAVE
HATED THIS.

07:29.917 --> 07:30.951
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

07:30.984 --> 07:32.986
BECAUSE HE TOLD US.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.656
...AND SO THEY
DUG HIM UP, RIGHT?

07:35.689 --> 07:37.157
AND ON THE INSIDE
OF THE COFFIN LID,

07:37.190 --> 07:38.826
THEY FOUND
SCRATCH MARKS.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.894
FRANTIC
SCRATCH MARKS.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.030
OH, GOD.
OH, NO WAY, MAN.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.031
I'M TELLIN' YOU.

07:44.064 --> 07:44.998
AND THE IRONY IS

07:45.032 --> 07:47.134
THEY WOULD HAVE
HEARD HIM TRYING
TO GET OUT,

07:47.167 --> 07:48.101
BUT ONE OF HIS
LAST WISHES

07:48.135 --> 07:51.238
WAS TO HAVE
A MARCHING BAND
AT HIS FUNERAL.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.106
I WOULD NEVER
WANT MY BODY

07:53.140 --> 07:55.676
TO BE STUCK
INSIDE OF SOME BOX.

07:55.709 --> 07:58.078
WHAT WOULD YOU CARE?
YOU'D BE DEAD.

07:58.111 --> 08:02.049
YEAH, MY BODY'D BE DEAD,
BUT MY SPIRIT...

08:02.082 --> 08:03.651
THAT'D STILL BE ALIVE.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.252
I'M DONATING MY BODY
TO SCIENCE.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.286
BUT NOT THE SKELETON.
I DON'T WANT--

08:06.319 --> 08:09.623
I DON'T WANT
MEDICAL STUDENTS
PUTTIN' HATS ON ME,

08:09.657 --> 08:10.824
AND CRAP LIKE THAT.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.126
I WANT TO BE CREMATED.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.062
AND THEN
I WANT YOU GUYS

08:15.095 --> 08:17.130
TO JUST TOSS ME
INTO THE WIND.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.098
YEAH, RIGHT.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.967
NO. NO, I MEAN IT.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.136
FROM RIGHT UP HERE.
ON THIS WATER TOWER
RIGHT HERE.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.906
BECAUSE THIS--YEAH,
THIS IS AS CLOSE

08:25.939 --> 08:28.676
AS YOU CAN GET TO HEAVEN
IN STATEN ISLAND.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.210
THAT'S SO TRUE.

08:30.243 --> 08:33.213
I JUST WANT YOU GUYS
TO JUST SET ME FREE...

08:33.246 --> 08:36.984
SO I CAN FLY IN THE SKY
LIKE A--

08:37.017 --> 08:39.620
FREE, LIKE A B-BIRD.

08:43.090 --> 08:47.127
HEY. HEY, SCOTT,
THAT WAS MY FRISBEE,
MAN!

08:47.160 --> 08:48.061
NOW IT'S FREE.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.664
BULL. THAT WAS,
LIKE, 8 BUCKS.

08:50.698 --> 08:53.033
LOOK, WITH THE EXCEPTION
OF YOUR WEDDING VOWS,

08:53.066 --> 08:54.968
OATHS TAKEN
BY STONED TEENAGERS

08:55.002 --> 08:56.003
ARE NOT LEGALLY BINDING.

08:56.036 --> 08:59.940
SCOTT WAS SERIOUS, DAD.
HE WAS OBSESSED ABOUT IT.

08:59.973 --> 09:03.010
SCOTT, WHAT ARE WE

16:11.704 --> 16:14.041
YEAH. YEAH, BUT IT
WASN'T MY FAULT.

16:14.074 --> 16:14.741
IT WASN'T
TUPPERWARE.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.709
IT WAS SOME
NO-NAME BRAND.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.611
YEAH. AND WE--

16:18.645 --> 16:20.747

BUT IT WAS SO DARK.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.150
BUT I WENT OUT THERE
THIS MORNING,

16:23.183 --> 16:24.617
AND I FOUND HIM.
HE WAS UNDER A BUSH,

16:24.651 --> 16:25.752

LIKE AN IDIOT

19:17.924 --> 19:19.592
WALKIN' INTO
THAT MAUSOLEUM

19:19.626 --> 19:21.461
CARRYING A CLOWN HEAD.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.863
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, WALT.
I'LL CARRY IT.

19:23.896 --> 19:24.897
YOU'RE NOT TAKIN' IT.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.199
SEAN, LISTEN TO ME.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.867
NO, I'M NOT GONNA
LISTEN TO YOU.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.602
YOU'RE
SELLIN' SCOTT OUT.

19:29.636 --> 19:30.837
SEAN, LOOK AT HIM.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.706
HE DOESN'T CARE
ANYMORE, ALL RIGHT?

19:33.740 --> 19:35.908
LAST NIGHT
WE WERE EMOTIONAL,

19:35.942 --> 19:36.943
AND WE WERE DRUNK,

19:36.976 --> 19:40.447
AND WE WERE EXTREMELY
IRRESPONSIBLE AND JUVENILE.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.914
CLAUDIA,
THAT'S THE POINT.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.750
IF THERE'S ONE THING
WE CAN LEARN FROM SCOTT,

19:43.783 --> 19:45.518
IT'S THAT WE DON'T
ALWAYS HAVE TO DO

19:45.552 --> 19:48.588
THE MOST RESPONSIBLE
THING ALL THE TIME.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.356
YES. FINE. FINE.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.957
THAT IS HOW SCOTT
LIVED HIS LIFE.

19:50.990 --> 19:51.791
IT IS NOT
HOW WE LIVE OURS.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.227
WELL, MAYBE WE SHOULD.
LIFE'S SO SHORT.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.595
WHY DON'T WE TAKE RISKS?

19:55.628 --> 19:57.364
WE TAKE RISKS,
ALL RIGHT?

19:57.397 --> 19:59.466
WE HAVE
AN ADJUSTABLE-RATE
MORTGAGE.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.968
WE JUST PAID OFF OUR VISA
WITH OUR MASTERCARD.

20:02.001 --> 20:06.239
WE ARE RAISING 3 KIDS
IN NEW YORK CITY,

20:06.273 --> 20:07.874
AND WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL WE'RE DOING.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.510
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU,
BUT I, FOR ONE,

20:10.543 --> 20:11.678
WOULD WELCOME A GLACIER.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.481
SCOTT ALWAYS ASKED ME
TO DO THESE CRAZY THINGS
WITH HIM,

20:14.514 --> 20:16.916
GO ON ADVENTURES
AND, YOU KNOW,
I ALWAYS SAID NO,

20:16.949 --> 20:18.985
'CAUSE I THOUGHT I'D
HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.854
AND FINALLY
I GET THIS CHANCE

20:21.888 --> 20:23.790
TO TAKE HIM
ON AN ADVENTURE--

20:23.823 --> 20:28.027
THE ONE ADVENTURE THAT
HE REALLY WANTED--

20:28.060 --> 20:29.296
AND I CAN'T.

20:29.329 --> 20:32.999
AND IT'S A DAMN SHAME.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.304
WELL.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.771
YEAH.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.277
WELL, UH,

20:44.311 --> 20:46.913
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.015
I SAID SOME
BEAUTIFUL THINGS

20:49.048 --> 20:51.884
TO THAT URN
FULL OF COFFEE,

20:51.918 --> 20:53.953
BUT, UH,
THEY ESCAPE ME NOW.

20:53.986 --> 20:57.924
I--IS SOMETHIN'
BURNIN' HERE?

20:59.459 --> 21:00.993
SOMEBODY'S
BURNING LEAVES.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.330
SWEET.
SMOKE.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.331
GO AHEAD, WALT.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.533
YEAH. ANYWAY, SCOTT,

21:06.566 --> 21:08.067
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND YOU
IN LIFE,

21:08.100 --> 21:10.870
AND I DON'T
UNDERSTAND YOU NOW,

21:10.903 --> 21:15.342
BUT YOU WERE
A GOOD KID...

21:15.375 --> 21:18.378
AND I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

21:18.411 --> 21:22.349
SO, GO ON NOW.
GET OUTTA HERE.

21:28.388 --> 21:32.925
WE PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T HAVE
PARKED SO CLOSE.

21:37.497 --> 21:38.431
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
GO THROUGH IT AGAIN.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.633
I WANT TO BE LAID OUT
FOR 2 NIGHTS AT DALTONS,

21:40.667 --> 21:42.802
AND AFTER THE SERVICE,
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
EVERYBODY

21:42.835 --> 21:44.871
TO THE BAMBOO GARDENS
FOR A NICE LUNCH.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.005
BUT, SO HELP ME GOD,

21:46.038 --> 21:48.875
IF YOU DESECRATE MY MEMORY
WITH A CASH BAR,

21:48.908 --> 21:52.679
I WILL COME BACK
AND KILL YOU BOTH.

21:52.712 --> 21:56.916
NOW, UH, I LEFT MY GUEST LIST
OUT IN THE CAR.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.686
I CAN'T TAKE
ANY MORE OF THIS.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.954
I SAY WE JUST TOSS HIM
OFF THE TOWER.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.823
HE'S NOT BEING CREMATED.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.393
NO. TONIGHT.
