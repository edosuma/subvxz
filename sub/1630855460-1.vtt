00:24.233 --> 00:25.359
( footsteps )

00:25.401 --> 00:27.194
( music playing )

00:27.236 --> 00:29.321
( footsteps )

00:36.871 --> 00:40.666
( chittering, chirping )

00:49.467 --> 00:50.468
( rustling )

00:55.097 --> 00:56.724
( footsteps, panting )

00:59.393 --> 01:02.480
( panting )

01:11.363 --> 01:14.158
( continues panting )

01:30.508 --> 01:32.676
- Aah!
- Shh!

01:32.718 --> 01:35.596
( in Spanish ) Always by my
side. Always by my side!

01:35.638 --> 01:38.891
I just can't believe
I'm doing this,

01:38.933 --> 01:41.769
we should have kept on scamming
tourists and be done.

01:41.811 --> 01:43.270
Do you want me to explain?

01:43.312 --> 01:44.688
These snakeskins are
worth more than

01:44.730 --> 01:46.482
the purses and wallets
that you steal.

01:46.524 --> 01:48.901
I don't care about that.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.694
Look, it's suicide to be here.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.446
It's suicide because
you don't do what I tell you.

01:52.488 --> 01:53.906
- By my side!
- No. I said no.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.408
It's insane to be hunting
at a place like this.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.285
I'm not afraid of Las Arenas.

01:58.327 --> 01:59.912
Well, I am, so what?

01:59.954 --> 02:01.914
( branch snaps )

02:01.956 --> 02:04.208
- See that? Bye!
- Stay here! Stay!

02:06.836 --> 02:10.089
( music playing )

02:24.353 --> 02:25.980
( rustling )

02:30.109 --> 02:31.819
( panting )

02:36.365 --> 02:38.242
( squelching )

02:43.372 --> 02:44.999
Aah!

02:54.592 --> 02:59.054
( screaming )

02:59.096 --> 03:03.017
( music playing )

03:20.618 --> 03:23.621
( chirping )

03:59.657 --> 04:02.743
( keyboard clicking )

04:13.671 --> 04:15.589
Josh (In English): So, we're here.

04:17.883 --> 04:19.677
How does it feel to be home?

04:24.556 --> 04:25.516
Sof?

04:25.557 --> 04:27.768
Give me a second.

04:27.810 --> 04:31.855
I mean, this is where
you were born right?

04:31.897 --> 04:33.440
Aren't you, I don't know,

04:33.482 --> 04:37.236
maybe a little bit
nostalgic, maybe?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.699
Yeah, maybe.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.869
It feels weird to be here.

04:45.911 --> 04:49.248
It's been a while
without being in Colombia.

04:54.712 --> 04:57.256
God.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.967
You and your guidebooks.

05:01.719 --> 05:03.929
I do like to do my research.

05:06.724 --> 05:09.560
These rainforests,
they look amazing.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.687
You're dreaming if you think
you have time to hike.

05:11.729 --> 05:14.940
Well, I brought my backpack.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.904
You called about
international, right?

05:20.946 --> 05:22.322
- No charges?
- No. You don't need it.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.449
You don't need it.
Just use the WhatsApp.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.702
Josh, they're three and five.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.287
This is the first time
we've ever left them.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.205
You want me to, what,
send them a heart emoji?

05:30.247 --> 05:32.124
Okay, fine. We'll do it when--
when I get to the hotel.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.501
No, I want to call my kids now.

05:34.543 --> 05:37.087
Sofia, we're, like,
two minutes away.

05:37.129 --> 05:40.966
- I promised them I would.
- Can you just wait? Please?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.137
No.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.732
Sofia:
I love you, too.

05:56.774 --> 05:59.943
Be good for grandma
and grandpa, all right?

05:59.985 --> 06:02.529
( in Spanish)

06:04.364 --> 06:05.324
( in English )
I love you. Bye.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.575
Let me talk--

06:09.203 --> 06:11.163
- Hey, we better check in.
- Marcos: Josh!

06:11.205 --> 06:14.166
- Hey! There he is.
- Marcos.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.543
- It's good to see you, buddy.
- Good to see you, man.

06:16.585 --> 06:17.753
( in Spanish )

06:19.379 --> 06:20.339
( in English )
I can't thank you enough

06:20.380 --> 06:21.548
for doing this last minute.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.383
Especially you, Sofia.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.010
I know you stopped your
practice when you had kids.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.387
Well, um, actually just
getting back, so this is good.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.057
Everybody I called before you
turned me down,

06:30.099 --> 06:33.560
so thanks for
saving my ass, really.

06:33.602 --> 06:36.355
Well, happy to help.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.190
And you are. You are.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.609
Colombia is in need
for more healthcare workers.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.653
Oh, yeah.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.782
Must feel good to be back, huh?

06:49.034 --> 06:50.786
Yeah, it's good to be here.

06:50.828 --> 06:52.788
It's gonna be hard
to stay focused.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.373
I mean, this is a--

06:54.414 --> 06:55.791
this is a beautiful country
you have here, man.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.376
Well, I shifted your
schedules a little bit,

06:57.417 --> 07:00.754
so your presentation
won't be until Friday.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.841
Great. Extra time to prepare.

07:03.882 --> 07:06.593
I thought you guys
needed a little alone time.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.637
I know you don't get away
from the kids that much, right?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.807
Thanks for thinking of us.

07:11.849 --> 07:13.392
You're still good
for dinner tonight?

07:13.433 --> 07:16.019
Yeah, sure. 8:00.
Is that all right?

07:16.061 --> 07:17.604
- Yeah. Awesome.
- ( in Spanish )

07:17.646 --> 07:19.606
I'll see you then.
Good to see you, man.

07:19.648 --> 07:22.025
( in Spanish )

07:22.067 --> 07:24.027
( in English )
Your passport.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.280
- Do you have it?
- No, I don't.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.660
- Why should I have it?
- Yeah. Okay.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.461
( speaking Spanish )

07:48.302 --> 07:52.639
( in English )
No, this-- it's my fault.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.683
Marcos booked the rooms
and I haven't told him yet.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.646
( speaking Spanish )

07:59.688 --> 08:02.065
( in English ) Let me see.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.066
( in English ) You should
tell him before dinner.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.861
Won't that be a bit awkward?

08:05.903 --> 08:07.654
Then tell him after.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.656
You guys are closer
anyways, right?

08:09.698 --> 08:11.700
( speaking Spanish )

08:20.167 --> 08:23.337
( in English )
It's a pretty great room, right?

08:25.923 --> 08:29.718
Okay, I'm sure that they'll
have an extra cot or something.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.678
You heard her.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.889
The hotel is packed with people
for this conference.

08:33.931 --> 08:35.474
All right, fine.
I'll sleep right there.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.392
- On the couch.
- No, I will.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.311
You know what?
Whatever you prefer.

08:39.353 --> 08:40.312
I don't know what
the big deal is.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.897
We just sat on an airplane

08:41.939 --> 08:43.482
for six hours
right next to each other.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.858
I just don't want to sleep
in the same room as you.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.110
I need space to work.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.112
Jesus, it's only for a few days.

08:49.154 --> 08:51.490
That's not the point.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.909
I mean, we haven't been under

08:53.951 --> 08:55.535
the same roof together in,
like, months,

08:55.577 --> 08:57.913
so it's not gonna kill you.

08:57.955 --> 09:01.500
Could you please stop talking?
Thank you.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.918
I don't like it either,
all right?

09:02.960 --> 09:04.044
I'm just trying to
make the best of it.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.128
Yeah, just like you.

09:05.170 --> 09:06.129
Just trying to make the best

09:06.171 --> 09:07.214
of a bad situation, right?

09:07.256 --> 09:11.134
If I'm such a fucking asshole,

09:11.176 --> 09:12.261
then why did you bother to come?

09:12.302 --> 09:13.762
Because I need this.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.518
Look...

09:19.559 --> 09:20.894
I'll just be working
in the business center.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.938
- Whatever. Fine.
- Yeah, and also,

09:22.980 --> 09:25.565
I'll leave dinner early tonight
so you can tell Marcos.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.955
I wish I had been there.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.165
You should have seen
your husband's face

09:42.207 --> 09:44.126
when he realized
he was stuck.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.169
- I was not stuck.
- That's bullshit.

09:46.211 --> 09:49.506
No, no, no, no.
Fine, I was--

09:49.548 --> 09:50.841
I was choosing
not to go forward.

09:50.882 --> 09:53.760
- Sounds the same to me.
- Okay, okay.

09:53.802 --> 09:57.014
I was stuck. But in my defense,
it was fucking pouring rain.

09:57.055 --> 10:00.809
- Where was this?
- Both: Uh, Brazil.

10:00.851 --> 10:03.854
It was, like, five years ago.

10:03.895 --> 10:08.108
Oh, yeah.
Right after Sadie was born.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.116
( waiter in Spanish )

10:20.620 --> 10:24.041
( in Spanish)

10:27.044 --> 10:28.420
( in English )
I hope you guys don't mind.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.714
I ordered some Colombian food.

10:30.756 --> 10:32.382
It's very nice.
It's called mondongo.

10:32.424 --> 10:33.675
- You're gonna love it.
- Mondongo has meat, right?

10:33.717 --> 10:34.676
( in Spanish )

10:34.718 --> 10:35.761
There's meat in the--

10:35.802 --> 10:36.762
- Yeah, no, no.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

10:36.803 --> 10:38.805
I forgot to tell you,

10:38.847 --> 10:41.058
Sofia is a vegetarian now.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.894
Really?

10:43.935 --> 10:46.021
Since when?

10:46.063 --> 10:49.024
When I was pregnant with Andy,
with our first,

10:49.066 --> 10:51.401
I realized I couldn't eat
anything that had a mother.

10:51.443 --> 10:54.821
- Okay, I can respect that.
- Mm.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.239
I don't have a problem.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.250
Josh: It's very good.
No, it's good.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.960
( in Spanish )

11:09.002 --> 11:11.838
I love to do my research.
I've been digging around.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.049
Looks like a lot of pretty
awesome places to go hiking.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.717
It's too bad you're
all booked up.

11:15.759 --> 11:18.053
Well, I'm actually trying
to clear up my morning,

11:18.095 --> 11:22.849
so do you know this place
called Cascada la Chorrera?

11:22.891 --> 11:26.645
Josh: Uh, yeah. It's only
Colombia's highest waterfall.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.064
- It's a beautiful place.
- No, it's very beautiful.

11:29.106 --> 11:31.858
And it's very close.
It's in Choachi. Really close.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.069
- You wanna go?
- Yeah, I wanna go. Let's do it.

11:34.111 --> 11:36.655
Marcos: Hey, I noticed
you still have the same awful

11:36.696 --> 11:38.657
- backpack you had in college.
- Oh, yeah.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.200
The one strapped
with the duct tape.

11:40.242 --> 11:41.451
Careful.
That's my lucky backpack.

11:41.493 --> 11:42.828
Marcos:
Well, it's fucking terrible.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.288
- It's pretty awful.
- Marcos: Right?

11:45.330 --> 11:47.290
I hope you don't mind me
stealing your husband,

11:47.332 --> 11:48.875
- but if you wanna come--
- No, no.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.252
Sof wouldn't be into it.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.214
Really?

11:56.341 --> 11:58.093
Not really your thing, is it?

11:58.135 --> 12:00.929
I love hiking.
We used to do it a lot.

12:00.971 --> 12:04.599
Sof, you haven't been
hiking in, like, ten years?

12:04.641 --> 12:07.519
So what? It doesn't mean
I stopped enjoying it.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.104
It must be hard to hike
with the little ones

12:09.146 --> 12:12.899
- strapped to your back.
- Exactly.

12:12.941 --> 12:16.319
But you know what?
I should pass.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.614
Not because I don't like it
or I don't enjoy it,

12:19.656 --> 12:22.701
but because I have a lot
of prep to do before Friday.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.120
I'm telling you,
you're going to do great.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.705
I don't know about
this guy, but--

12:26.746 --> 12:29.332
Yeah, well, I'm gonna do
the same presentation

12:29.374 --> 12:31.251
I've been doing for years,
so I'll be fine.

12:31.293 --> 12:33.378
Actually, I should head to bed.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.089
( in Spanish )

12:36.131 --> 12:37.924
( in English )
Bye, guys.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.140
Did I say something wrong?

12:45.182 --> 12:48.143
No, no. It's not you.

12:48.185 --> 12:52.564
I was gonna tell you earlier.
I should have, probably.

12:52.606 --> 12:55.942
Sofia and I have decided
that we're gonna split up.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.614
What? When?

13:03.992 --> 13:05.994
It's fairly recent, so...

13:09.789 --> 13:13.877
Wow. You guys
are the perfect couple.

13:17.214 --> 13:18.632
Yeah.

13:20.425 --> 13:21.843
Are you seeing someone else?

13:23.220 --> 13:25.222
It's not that. It's just, um...

13:30.018 --> 13:33.104
We've changed
and we'll be better off apart.

13:39.236 --> 13:40.695
I don't know what to say.

13:40.737 --> 13:45.408
Say, "Josh, what time
am I picking you up

13:45.450 --> 13:48.036
so we can go hiking
tomorrow morning?"

13:51.665 --> 13:53.041
Okay.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.254
Cheers.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.258
( door opens )

15:38.355 --> 15:41.524
- ( door closes )
- Sofia: Why aren't you dressed?

15:41.566 --> 15:46.738
Oh, Marcos couldn't get free.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.531
Oh. Okay.

15:48.573 --> 15:51.326
I think I wanna go.

15:51.368 --> 15:53.828
- To?
- Choachi.

15:53.870 --> 15:58.333
I don't get many chances to do
stuff like this, so, yeah.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.752
Are you gonna go by yourself?

16:00.794 --> 16:03.088
Who else would I go with?

16:03.129 --> 16:05.924
Come on, Sofia.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.384
I'll be back tonight.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.471
I-- I can go with you.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.348
I'll be fine on my own.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.141
I know I'm the last person

16:15.183 --> 16:18.186
that you wanna be around
right now, but come on.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.814
It's not safe to go hiking
around here by yourself.

16:24.359 --> 16:25.360
Okay.

16:27.570 --> 16:28.530
Okay?

16:28.571 --> 16:31.700
Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.794
( speaking Spanish )

16:56.850 --> 16:58.435
- ( Sofia in English ) Okay.
- Josh: No, no, no, wait.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.103
Is this the only road?

17:00.145 --> 17:01.730
Because, I mean, that's gonna
take us hours, right?

17:01.771 --> 17:03.606
Sofia: Well, looks like
if we drove through this area,

17:03.648 --> 17:06.359
- we'll get there faster?
- Pedro: No, no, no, no, no.

17:06.401 --> 17:09.946
That's Las Arenas.
It's not a safe place.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.990
What's Las Arenas?
I've never heard of it.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.659
It's north of Choachi,
close to the water.

17:14.701 --> 17:19.247
Even locals won't go there.
It's quite dangerous.

17:19.289 --> 17:21.332
I'm a pretty experienced
hiker, so...

17:21.374 --> 17:26.004
Um, wildlife there is dangerous.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.548
Particularly snakes.
Big snakes.

17:28.590 --> 17:31.634
Snakes? I'm Colombian.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.345
I don't remember snakes
being in cold mountains.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.014
Times have changed.

17:36.055 --> 17:38.850
As climate gets warmer,
you have new species coming in.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.852
Not to talk about the erosion.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.229
You see, the land
is not very steady.

17:43.271 --> 17:48.860
You have steep ravines,
unsteady ground.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.445
- We'll avoid it, then.
- No, no, no, I mean,

17:50.487 --> 17:51.738
the other way,
it'll save us time.

17:51.780 --> 17:56.034
- No way. I hate snakes.
- She's right.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.037
Las Arenas is not a place
you want to find yourself.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.663
( in Spanish )

18:05.710 --> 18:07.504
Would you help me
with this, please?

18:08.713 --> 18:10.507
Thank you.

18:23.228 --> 18:26.523
( music playing )

20:25.433 --> 20:29.437
( panting )

20:41.908 --> 20:46.579
( continues panting )

21:55.523 --> 21:59.485
( footsteps )

21:59.527 --> 22:00.945
( Josh exhales )

22:02.321 --> 22:04.699
( backpack clattering )

22:04.741 --> 22:06.743
This altitude is no joke.

22:07.744 --> 22:11.080
- Here.
- Thanks.

22:11.122 --> 22:13.332
Thank you for waiting for me.

22:17.962 --> 22:19.047
I had a cramp.

22:23.176 --> 22:24.177
Okay.

22:27.221 --> 22:28.931
( thunder )

22:28.973 --> 22:30.349
Oh, shit.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.937
Ah, that's not good. Fuck.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.481
Babe, we gotta turn back.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.316
We're not going back.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.319
We're so close.
You really wanna cut it short?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.738
No, I don't want
to cut it short.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.531
But I definitely don't
want to get caught in that.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.784
Come on.
We gotta go. Trust me.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.037
( in Spanish )

22:51.079 --> 22:52.080
( in English )
We gotta go.

22:53.790 --> 22:56.793
- Okay.
- Come on, we gotta walk fast.

22:58.002 --> 22:59.212
Thanks.

23:03.007 --> 23:06.552
( music playing )

23:06.594 --> 23:10.223
( thunder )

23:36.415 --> 23:38.543
( whispering )

23:41.045 --> 23:45.508
Oh, shit. Shit.
He's breaking into the car.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.927
- I'll go talk to him.
- No. What are you doing?

23:47.969 --> 23:50.179
- No, we don't.
- Yes, we do.

23:50.221 --> 23:51.973
Please, stay put
until he leaves.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.809
- What if he steals the car?
- You're not going out there.

23:54.851 --> 23:57.228
- I'm just gonna scare him off.
- Hey, he's not a pigeon.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.814
- You don't know what he'll do.
- Yeah, well-- listen.

23:59.856 --> 24:02.817
Shh! Look, I am not
getting stuck here.

24:02.859 --> 24:04.819
- Please.
- No. Shh.

24:04.861 --> 24:06.154
Please, please.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.239
Stay hidden,
stay out of sight.

24:08.281 --> 24:10.283
I've got this.
Just back off.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.287
Josh: Hey!

24:14.328 --> 24:16.038
( speaking Spanish )

24:16.080 --> 24:17.665
( in English )
Can I help you with something?

24:19.292 --> 24:20.626
Whoa. Oh! Whoa, whoa.

24:22.879 --> 24:26.924
( in English ) No have money.

24:30.678 --> 24:32.180
( in English )
No wallet.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.686
( in English )
Yeah. Okay.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.118
( in English )
She left. It's only me.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.745
( in English ) It's only me.

25:01.042 --> 25:02.084
( Josh in English )
What are you doing?

25:02.126 --> 25:04.253
Shh!

25:17.016 --> 25:19.352
- ( grunts )
- ( in English ) Run! Run!

25:26.943 --> 25:28.069
Josh: Go!

25:36.869 --> 25:40.164
- ( thunder )
- Go, go go!

25:44.168 --> 25:47.004
Are you okay?

25:47.046 --> 25:49.131
We should go that way,
where no one goes.

25:49.173 --> 25:50.925
Las Arenas.
He won't follow us.

25:50.967 --> 25:52.843
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.720
Do you think he's gone?

25:54.762 --> 25:56.847
Fuck, I don't know.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.141
- What the fuck are we gonna do?
- Okay, listen.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.519
Listen to me.
We'll do your plan.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.354
We'll go to Las Arenas
and we'll wait out the storm.

26:03.396 --> 26:04.772
All right? Come on.

26:04.814 --> 26:06.232
Come on!

26:07.775 --> 26:08.776
What?

26:10.903 --> 26:13.531
- You had to be the hero.
- So this is my fucking fault?

26:13.572 --> 26:15.283
You always think you can talk
yourself out of everything.

26:15.324 --> 26:16.617
How was I supposed to know
that he had a gun?

26:16.659 --> 26:18.160
If you had stayed put
as I told you,

26:18.202 --> 26:19.287
none of this
would have happened!

26:19.328 --> 26:20.538
You are un-fucking-believable!

26:20.579 --> 26:22.581
- ( gunshots )
- Just run!

26:22.623 --> 26:26.585
Run, Sof! Run! Go!

26:26.627 --> 26:27.920
( Sofia whimpers )

26:33.092 --> 26:36.554
( thunder )

26:57.450 --> 26:58.409
( grunts )

26:58.451 --> 27:02.455
( rain falling )

27:16.469 --> 27:18.637
( thunder )

27:37.656 --> 27:39.033
Sofia: Josh.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.288
Josh.

27:48.751 --> 27:51.337
( panting )

27:51.379 --> 27:52.380
Josh?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.099
Josh!

28:11.899 --> 28:12.900
Josh!

28:27.915 --> 28:29.125
Josh!

28:30.126 --> 28:31.460
( screams )

28:32.545 --> 28:35.131
( grunting )

28:39.718 --> 28:40.928
Fuck!

28:48.352 --> 28:50.396
Help!

28:59.947 --> 29:01.073
Sofia!

29:01.115 --> 29:03.784
( screaming )

29:03.826 --> 29:06.495
- Sofia!
- Josh! Josh!

29:06.537 --> 29:09.874
Josh! Josh! Josh!

29:09.915 --> 29:11.542
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

29:11.584 --> 29:12.793
Stop, stop!

29:12.835 --> 29:15.337
Calm-- calm down, okay?

29:15.379 --> 29:16.922
Try and move to my hand.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.884
- It's too thick.
- Baby, you gotta try, okay?

29:19.925 --> 29:22.928
- I can't! I'm stuck!
- Okay, just hang on.

29:22.970 --> 29:25.347
Hang on. Hang on.

29:25.389 --> 29:27.016
I can't even stick out my arms!

29:27.057 --> 29:28.017
Hold on!

29:28.058 --> 29:31.937
( screaming )

29:31.979 --> 29:34.356
Wait, okay?

29:34.398 --> 29:36.942
Try to reach it, okay?

29:36.984 --> 29:39.153
Come on, baby! You can do it!

29:39.195 --> 29:42.948
- Try, babe. Come on.
- ( moaning )

29:42.990 --> 29:45.367
Get it.

29:45.409 --> 29:47.161
Ah, fuck! Okay, wait.

29:47.203 --> 29:49.246
Wait.

29:49.288 --> 29:50.998
Hold on, okay?

29:53.000 --> 29:54.126
Just stay calm, okay?

29:56.629 --> 29:58.464
No, no! Don't!

29:58.506 --> 30:00.674
Stop moving! Stop moving!
Don't move!

30:00.716 --> 30:03.719
Stop moving! Sofia!

30:14.813 --> 30:17.900
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

30:17.942 --> 30:21.862
Come on, come on.
I got you. I got you.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.409
Come on, come on. Come on!

30:27.451 --> 30:30.621
I got you. I got you!
Okay? I got you.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.998
- ( gasping )
- I got you. I got you.

30:33.040 --> 30:35.417
- I got you. I got you.
- ( thunder )

30:35.459 --> 30:37.628
- It's okay. It's okay.
- What-- what did you--

30:37.670 --> 30:39.421
Shh, shh, shh. Just stay calm.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.216
- But why-- why are you here?
- No, no, no. Stay calm.

30:42.258 --> 30:44.343
I don't-- don't move, okay?
Don't move.

30:44.385 --> 30:47.638
We both need to be
perfectly still, okay?

30:47.680 --> 30:49.265
You should've...

30:52.059 --> 30:54.019
I think--

30:54.061 --> 30:56.397
I think this is like quicksand.

31:01.277 --> 31:05.281
Josh, you there?
I got free early.

31:10.869 --> 31:11.870
Josh?

31:24.508 --> 31:26.176
( Josh on recording )
Marcos, buddy,

31:26.218 --> 31:28.846
I know we were gonna
meet up later, but, uh,

31:28.887 --> 31:32.349
Sofia and I are gonna
actually go hiking in Choachi,

31:32.391 --> 31:35.269
so we probably won't be
back till late,

31:35.311 --> 31:38.731
and I guess I'll see you
tomorrow, man. Cheers.

31:40.524 --> 31:41.900
Okay.

31:49.533 --> 31:52.786
Josh: At least
it stopped raining.

31:52.828 --> 31:53.871
Sofia:
I think I moved a little.

31:53.912 --> 31:54.872
- Josh: No, you didn't.
- Look!

31:54.913 --> 31:56.874
Josh: You didn't, honey.

31:56.915 --> 31:59.960
I need-- ( grunts )
I need to look at your head.

32:00.002 --> 32:01.879
- Come on.
- It's fine.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.297
Baby, let me look at your head.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.132
We just need to get out of this.

32:12.139 --> 32:14.099
God, isn't it crazy
that we're stuck?

32:14.141 --> 32:15.851
Well, I wouldn't
worry too much, okay?

32:15.893 --> 32:20.648
I've never heard of anybody
fucking dying in quicksand.

32:23.359 --> 32:25.527
Won't it suck us down?

32:25.569 --> 32:28.322
No, it doesn't work that way.

32:28.364 --> 32:30.741
The weight of the mud,

32:30.783 --> 32:33.744
its density is-- it's heavier
than the human body.

32:33.786 --> 32:36.997
- How the fuck do you know that?
- The guidebook.

32:37.039 --> 32:41.335
It says water, it flows in
and it gets trapped

32:41.377 --> 32:44.546
underneath the dirt
and it creates this fucking

32:44.588 --> 32:46.548
heavy as shit mud.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.926
- How far down does it go?
- I don't know.

32:48.967 --> 32:52.179
Didn't the guidebook tell you
how to get out of this?

32:56.183 --> 32:57.601
No.

33:00.396 --> 33:03.273
Okay, just give me--
give me a second here, okay?

33:03.315 --> 33:05.776
I'm gonna try to go backward.

33:05.818 --> 33:08.362
Just push me. Just-- no.

33:08.404 --> 33:11.073
Don't do that. No, I just--
just-- I just--

33:13.409 --> 33:15.577
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
I can't move, man.

33:15.619 --> 33:16.954
Look over there.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.373
Josh:
Where did that come from?

33:19.415 --> 33:22.751
I think I knocked it loose
when I was falling.

33:22.793 --> 33:25.963
See how it is resting
over the surface?

33:26.004 --> 33:28.549
Maybe I can spread out
my body weight so I won't sink.

33:28.590 --> 33:31.593
- Try to push me over the edge.
- Sof.

33:31.635 --> 33:32.928
Try to push me over the edge.

33:32.970 --> 33:33.971
We can't even move
our fucking legs.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.597
Please.

33:35.639 --> 33:37.182
- Just try.
- What do you want me to do?

33:37.224 --> 33:38.600
- Give me your hand.
- Okay.

33:38.642 --> 33:41.061
- Stay put.
- Okay. Wait. Just wait.

33:41.103 --> 33:43.230
Let me get this hand
fucking down there.

33:43.272 --> 33:46.525
Give me a-- I can grab you.
Just-- just wait. Wait.

33:46.567 --> 33:51.405
- ( gasping )
- ( grunting )

33:51.447 --> 33:54.992
No, fuck it.
Just hold on. Fuck.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.619
It's not working.
It's not gonna work. Just wait.

33:57.661 --> 34:00.205
Try to take off my boot.

34:00.247 --> 34:01.665
Let me try.

34:03.459 --> 34:05.377
- Fuck.
- What?

34:08.672 --> 34:11.216
- There's something down here.
- What?

34:11.258 --> 34:12.843
- What? What do you mean?
- There's something down here.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.595
- What do you mean?
- I don't know what it is.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.221
- Oh, shit. Okay, I'll--
- Let's try to pull it.

34:16.263 --> 34:18.640
- At three. Together, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

34:18.682 --> 34:21.226
- One, two, three.
- Yeah. Yeah.

34:21.268 --> 34:22.686
( grunting )

34:26.273 --> 34:28.233
Fuck! Fuck!

34:28.275 --> 34:30.694
- Fuck!
- Jesus fucking Christ.

34:35.073 --> 34:37.034
- Look at his skin.
- Yeah.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.578
The tissue degradation
on his face.

34:39.620 --> 34:43.040
He starved to death.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.125
Fuck.

34:45.167 --> 34:47.252
Okay, okay.

34:47.294 --> 34:49.046
Baby.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.049
I'm gonna try to get
his pack off, all right?

34:52.090 --> 34:53.884
I got his pack.

34:53.926 --> 34:56.595
( both grunting )

35:02.935 --> 35:05.813
Let me help. Let me help.

35:10.317 --> 35:12.486
I can't stand this.

35:12.528 --> 35:15.322
We should put him back.
Help me.

35:17.324 --> 35:19.535
- ( groans )
- Hang on.

35:30.337 --> 35:32.339
Let's see what he's got.

35:52.985 --> 35:53.986
Look.

35:57.823 --> 36:02.160
- There's a knife.
- Okay.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.583
Oh, yeah.

36:10.794 --> 36:13.171
Some light reading material.

36:14.965 --> 36:17.342
What was he out here hunting?

36:17.384 --> 36:19.595
I don't think we wanna know.

36:26.018 --> 36:27.603
Two shells left.

36:29.813 --> 36:31.148
Why didn't he just kill himself?

36:34.026 --> 36:38.238
- Brutal way to die.
- Yeah. Okay.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.408
The way I see it, we only got
two ways out of here.

36:42.826 --> 36:44.161
Either someone pulls us out.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.580
No one knows we're here, Josh!
No one!

36:46.622 --> 36:50.667
Okay! So we got to pull
ourselves out.

36:50.709 --> 36:54.630
- How?
- Look behind me.

36:54.671 --> 36:57.633
You see that tree stump
and that rock?

36:58.842 --> 37:01.428
What about it?

37:01.470 --> 37:04.264
They look strong enough
to hold your weight.

37:05.974 --> 37:08.602
- It's fucking far away.
- Yeah.

37:08.644 --> 37:10.437
So...

37:14.650 --> 37:18.528
...we cut this backpack
into strips

37:18.570 --> 37:20.405
and we tie it together.

37:20.447 --> 37:24.034
It's cotton canvas.

37:24.076 --> 37:26.620
It should hold.

37:26.662 --> 37:29.581
- You're gonna lasso that rock?
- No.

37:31.667 --> 37:33.085
You are.

37:35.462 --> 37:37.965
I'm not sure I can do it.

37:38.006 --> 37:39.883
Sof, it's our only
fucking chance.

37:42.094 --> 37:44.221
Help me.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.683
I'll hold the bag, you cut.
Watch your fucking fingers.

37:50.477 --> 37:51.687
Yeah.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.898
Cut. Watch your fingers.
Watch your fingers.

37:54.940 --> 37:58.443
- ( Sofia grunts )
- Josh: Wait.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.904
Wait one sec.
One sec, one sec, one sec.

38:03.115 --> 38:05.283
Come on. Watch your fingers.
Here, here.

38:06.910 --> 38:08.620
Here. Okay.

38:16.294 --> 38:20.132
( sighs )

38:34.938 --> 38:40.110
( whispering in Spanish )

38:47.743 --> 38:49.745
( speaking Spanish )

39:17.105 --> 39:20.734
( in English )
Okay. That's that.

39:20.776 --> 39:22.944
Do you think it'll be enough?

39:22.986 --> 39:25.197
We'll see.

39:28.784 --> 39:30.952
Remember that
conference in Texas?

39:30.994 --> 39:32.954
( Josh laughs )

39:32.996 --> 39:35.540
I was just thinking about that.

39:35.582 --> 39:37.959
We were about
to take that rodeo lesson.

39:38.001 --> 39:40.754
- You got food poisoning.
- Yeah.

39:40.796 --> 39:43.256
Who orders twenty oysters
in a restaurant in Texas?

39:43.298 --> 39:44.633
I don't know.

39:44.674 --> 39:46.802
A lasso would have
come in handy then.

39:49.012 --> 39:50.388
Hey.

39:55.227 --> 39:56.311
You got this.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.023
I'll do my best.

40:04.820 --> 40:07.572
Okay. You got it. You got it.

40:07.614 --> 40:09.991
Here, just wait.
Let me hold this up.

40:10.033 --> 40:12.577
I can just--
pull this stuff up.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.371
- ( groans )
- Okay. Go.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.833
- ( panting )
- ( grunts )

40:30.137 --> 40:33.390
How short are we?

40:33.431 --> 40:35.600
- I think eight feet or so.
- Fuck.

40:35.642 --> 40:39.146
Maybe if we cut the straps,
we can make it longer.

40:39.187 --> 40:40.647
No, no. I made them
this thick for a reason.

40:40.689 --> 40:42.858
Need to make sure
they don't break.

40:45.235 --> 40:47.612
Okay, wait.

40:47.654 --> 40:50.407
I'll take off my jacket.
We'll use my jacket.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.825
- Are you able to do it?
- Yeah, I can do it.

40:51.867 --> 40:53.618
- I'll do the same.
- No. No.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.245
Sof, you gotta keep
yours on, okay?

40:55.287 --> 40:57.622
- You'll freeze to death.
- We need more than one.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.876
What then?

41:08.300 --> 41:10.302
Marcos. Marcos will come.

41:12.679 --> 41:13.805
He'll find us.

41:13.847 --> 41:16.266
We just said it.

41:16.308 --> 41:18.268
They don't have
a clue where we are.

41:18.310 --> 41:19.853
But in the morning,
when we're not there,

41:19.895 --> 41:22.647
- he'll know something's up.
- And then do what?

41:22.689 --> 41:24.482
And then he'll fucking--
he'll call the police.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.484
They'll send out a search party.

41:26.526 --> 41:29.070
Do you know how big
is this rainforest?

41:29.112 --> 41:30.947
Marcos thinks we are, like,
an hour away from this.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.365
That is not the point.

41:32.407 --> 41:34.451
The point is people
will be looking for us.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.662
( helicopter approaching )

41:37.704 --> 41:39.706
( music playing )

41:47.130 --> 41:48.798
( Sofia sighs )

41:51.343 --> 41:55.889
Josh! Look!

41:55.931 --> 41:59.309
- ( helicopter approaching )
- Hey! Hey, we're here!

41:59.351 --> 42:02.103
- Hey!
- We're here!

42:02.145 --> 42:04.397
- Josh: Hey, hey!
- Hey!

42:04.439 --> 42:08.360
It's one of those
sight-seeing tours. Hey!

42:08.401 --> 42:09.611
Sofia: Hey!

42:09.653 --> 42:10.904
Josh:
Fuck, they can't see us.

42:10.946 --> 42:12.697
Hey! Hey!

42:12.739 --> 42:15.116
The whole point of
that tour is to look down.

42:15.158 --> 42:16.117
They could see us.

42:16.159 --> 42:17.702
The trees are too fucking thick.

42:17.744 --> 42:21.915
Hey! Hey!

42:21.957 --> 42:25.168
Hey! Hey!

42:28.546 --> 42:29.923
What are you doing?

42:29.965 --> 42:33.718
They will see
the fire or the smoke.

42:33.760 --> 42:36.346
- Sofia, it's not gonna work.
- Yes, it's gonna work.

42:36.388 --> 42:37.889
- It's not gonna work.
- Yes, it's gonna work!

42:37.931 --> 42:40.517
- Honey. Honey.
- Fuck.

42:40.558 --> 42:42.519
It's not gonna catch on fire.
It's not gonna work.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.271
- It's gonna work.
- You would need a stack

42:44.312 --> 42:46.064
of dry Bibles
to catch on fire, okay?

42:46.106 --> 42:47.732
There's not gonna be
any fucking fire.

42:47.774 --> 42:48.942
This is the only thing we have.

42:48.984 --> 42:51.069
- ( helicopter passing )
- I told you.

42:51.111 --> 42:52.112
It's not gonna work.

42:56.574 --> 42:59.369
No, no, no, no, stop.
Stop!

42:59.411 --> 43:00.870
- We need to make real fire!
- No!

43:00.912 --> 43:03.373
- Let me do it! Let me do it!
- No!

43:03.415 --> 43:06.167
If you burn this
and they don't see it,

43:06.209 --> 43:07.460
it's all we fucking have!

43:07.502 --> 43:09.379
We don't have anything anyways.

43:09.421 --> 43:10.463
Let me! We're gonna
lose our chance--

43:10.505 --> 43:12.132
You're not gonna
fucking burn it!

43:12.173 --> 43:15.802
You're not fucking burning it!
You're not burning it!

43:15.844 --> 43:17.470
You're not fucking burning it.

43:19.347 --> 43:21.599
- ( silence )
- ( Sofia panting )

43:21.641 --> 43:24.185
We just fucked up our chance.

43:26.021 --> 43:28.606
Someone's gonna find us.

43:38.825 --> 43:41.077
( panting )

43:50.837 --> 43:55.050
( music playing )

44:12.484 --> 44:15.653
Do you have any granola bar
in your pocket by any chance?

44:15.695 --> 44:18.656
All the food, the water,
it's all in my backpack.

44:20.283 --> 44:24.245
We're gonna get dehydrated.

44:24.287 --> 44:28.041
You don't know that.
You don't know--

44:28.083 --> 44:31.252
By this time tomorrow
we might be

44:31.294 --> 44:33.630
in the dining room
at the hotel,

44:33.671 --> 44:37.133
having lunch, laughing about
all this with Marcos.

44:38.885 --> 44:40.804
- I don't think so.
- I'm just--

44:40.845 --> 44:43.848
I'm trying to stay positive.

44:43.890 --> 44:46.851
Fuck. It's early!

44:46.893 --> 44:51.106
We might get back tonight
in time for dinner.

44:54.692 --> 44:58.279
Could you please stop talking
about dinner and breakfast?

44:58.321 --> 45:02.283
I just don't want to be
reminded. Thank you.

45:02.325 --> 45:04.035
You're the one
who brought it up!

45:04.077 --> 45:06.538
It's true.

45:15.130 --> 45:17.966
Ouch! Ow, ow! Ouch, ouch!

45:18.007 --> 45:20.301
- What's wrong?
- Something bit me.

45:20.343 --> 45:22.220
- What?
- Ouch! It's killing me.

45:22.262 --> 45:25.140
- Help me! Help me!
- I can't-- I can't reach you.

45:25.181 --> 45:27.058
It's ants.
Fucking swipe them away.

45:27.100 --> 45:28.393
- Help me. What--
- I can't fucking reach you.

45:28.435 --> 45:30.270
- What is-- the fuck?
- Ants. Ants.

45:30.311 --> 45:32.647
Wait, wait, wait.
Just give me a second. Hang on.

45:32.689 --> 45:34.107
Hang on. I got something.

45:34.149 --> 45:37.026
Okay. Here, use this,
use this, use this.

45:37.068 --> 45:39.529
The alcohol acts as a repellent.
Yes. Yeah, it's working.

45:39.571 --> 45:41.322
Your neck, your neck, your neck.
Your fucking neck.

45:41.364 --> 45:42.907
Over there, over there.
Right there, right there.

45:42.949 --> 45:44.534
- Right there. It's working.
- Fuck.

45:44.576 --> 45:46.536
- Oh, it's burning.
- Yeah, yeah. In the back.

45:46.578 --> 45:48.913
- In the back. In the back.
- Oh, it's burning. Oh!

45:48.955 --> 45:50.957
It worked. It's working.
It worked, baby.

45:50.999 --> 45:53.334
Okay. Okay. Oh, babe.

45:53.376 --> 45:56.463
Baby, baby.
Baby, baby, baby.

45:56.504 --> 45:59.507
No, I still feel them.
I still feel them.

45:59.549 --> 46:01.885
- No, no, they're gone. Hon.
- Ow, fuck.

46:01.926 --> 46:04.554
Sof, they're gone, baby.
You're okay. You're okay.

46:04.596 --> 46:07.015
We got them. We got them.
You're okay. They're gone.

46:07.056 --> 46:08.057
They're gone.

46:21.196 --> 46:24.324
You have been carrying
this around?

46:24.365 --> 46:26.618
I had it tucked away.

46:28.995 --> 46:30.413
In your underwear?

46:33.625 --> 46:36.211
I didn't--
I didn't want you to see it.

46:38.004 --> 46:42.550
You don't have a granola bar,
but you have vodka.

46:52.227 --> 46:54.437
You were sober for so long.

46:57.232 --> 46:58.858
Or at least I thought that.

47:02.278 --> 47:04.030
- When did you start again?
- I don't know.

47:05.323 --> 47:07.033
I don't know.

47:07.075 --> 47:08.993
( muttering )

47:09.035 --> 47:12.330
It's-- it's, um...

47:12.372 --> 47:13.373
it's been a while.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.586
Have you been drinking
at the hospital?

47:18.628 --> 47:21.798
No. No. Sofia, no.

47:21.839 --> 47:23.258
You know I'd never do that.

47:23.299 --> 47:24.842
Then why?

47:26.928 --> 47:28.680
I've been under a lot of stress.

47:31.849 --> 47:32.850
The work.

47:36.062 --> 47:37.355
With us.

47:37.397 --> 47:41.442
- Us?
- Yeah. Getting divorced sucks.

47:41.484 --> 47:44.487
Trust me. I know, too.

47:47.699 --> 47:53.037
But, you know,
we're miserable, right?

47:53.079 --> 47:56.499
We just walk around
like fucking strangers.

48:02.505 --> 48:04.716
Strangers would
have been better.

48:08.094 --> 48:09.095
You and me...

48:13.141 --> 48:14.726
...we didn't even
like each other.

48:23.776 --> 48:27.113
( hissing, slithering )

48:32.535 --> 48:34.412
Why didn't we use the rifle?

48:34.454 --> 48:37.206
What?

48:37.248 --> 48:41.210
Why didn't we shoot it to get
the helicopter's attention?

48:51.012 --> 48:52.597
Hand it to me.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.141
What?

48:57.769 --> 48:59.020
Please.

49:18.247 --> 49:21.959
Just be very careful.
It's loaded.

49:22.001 --> 49:24.921
( hissing, slithering )

49:24.962 --> 49:26.464
Sofia:
We just need eight more feet.

49:28.174 --> 49:30.093
Think it'll hold?

49:30.134 --> 49:33.012
- It's about two feet.
- Who cares?

49:33.054 --> 49:34.347
It's not gonna be long enough.

49:34.389 --> 49:35.932
Sofia:
At least I'm trying.

49:35.973 --> 49:37.558
- It's something.
- We need to accept

49:37.600 --> 49:40.978
that we're gonna be here
for a long while,

49:41.020 --> 49:43.940
- maybe even days.
- Not if we get creative.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.650
Marcos will notice
that we're missing.

49:45.692 --> 49:49.153
- We can't rely on him.
- Yes, we can.

49:49.195 --> 49:52.990
- ( hissing, slithering )
- ( Sofia panting )

49:55.827 --> 49:57.620
We just need
to find a way to--

50:01.624 --> 50:04.377
Fuck. Fuck!

50:04.419 --> 50:07.213
Josh! Fuck! A snake!

50:11.509 --> 50:13.553
It can't come on
this quicksand, right?

50:13.594 --> 50:16.389
( panting, whimpering )

50:16.431 --> 50:17.974
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

50:18.015 --> 50:20.601
Shh. Don't move.

50:20.643 --> 50:24.397
It's defending its young.

50:24.439 --> 50:27.358
The egg. I knocked it out.

50:27.400 --> 50:30.236
( music playing )

50:31.654 --> 50:32.822
Is it venomous?

50:35.241 --> 50:37.452
- Fuck, probably.
- Fuck.

50:37.493 --> 50:39.829
Josh: Okay,
we can't let it bite us,

50:39.871 --> 50:41.205
so pick up the gun.
Pick up the gun.

50:41.247 --> 50:43.332
Pick up the gun.
Honey, pick up the gun.

50:43.374 --> 50:46.002
I've never used one before.

50:46.043 --> 50:49.422
You can do this. Pick it up now.
Pick it up now, all right?

50:49.464 --> 50:51.924
You got it.

50:51.966 --> 50:53.843
Baby, you can do it.

50:53.885 --> 50:55.636
It's a shotgun.
It's got a big kick,

50:55.678 --> 50:57.430
but the good news is
whatever you point it at,

50:57.472 --> 50:58.765
you're probably gonna kill it.

50:58.806 --> 51:00.308
Come on. Honey, honey?

51:00.349 --> 51:03.686
- ( grunting )
- ( hisses )

51:07.273 --> 51:09.066
- Let me see.
- ( grunting )

51:10.359 --> 51:12.236
Josh: This is bad.
This is bad.

51:12.278 --> 51:16.240
Oh, God, it's bad.
It's bad. It is bad.

51:16.282 --> 51:17.867
I need to slow down the venom.

51:17.909 --> 51:19.285
We need every inch
of the rope.

51:19.327 --> 51:21.954
No, no, no.
I need you to shut up, okay?

51:21.996 --> 51:25.124
I need your heart rate
to stay as low as possible.

51:25.166 --> 51:27.502
Ah! Jesus!

51:27.543 --> 51:29.587
( whimpering )

51:29.629 --> 51:31.881
Okay, we know-- we know--

51:31.923 --> 51:34.050
we both know
how this goes, okay?

51:34.091 --> 51:35.885
The venom attacks
the cells, yeah?

51:35.927 --> 51:38.054
Then it attacks the organs.

51:38.095 --> 51:39.764
Okay, my organs
are going to shut down.

51:39.806 --> 51:41.349
I need to get to a hospital.

51:41.390 --> 51:46.270
No, no. So, look at me.
Calm down. All right?

51:46.312 --> 51:48.272
We still have time.
We still have time.

51:48.314 --> 51:50.566
- We don't.
- Six hours. Maybe more.

51:50.608 --> 51:52.693
( stammering )

51:52.735 --> 51:54.904
I'm gonna be in
a fuckload of pain, baby.

51:54.946 --> 51:57.490
I'm gonna be in
a fuckload of pain.

52:02.662 --> 52:04.330
( gate buzzes )

52:12.547 --> 52:17.093
( in Spanish )
Hey. Hey, look at me.

52:17.134 --> 52:18.761
Are my friends alive?

52:22.139 --> 52:25.309
Do you want money?

52:26.143 --> 52:27.979
I've got 200 dollars. If you
want them,

52:28.020 --> 52:30.022
they are yours but
tell me where they are.

52:31.774 --> 52:33.943
Hand them over.

52:33.985 --> 52:35.736
They are upstairs in my bag.

52:36.487 --> 52:37.738
When we get out of here

52:37.780 --> 52:39.532
I'll tell the police this was
all a misunderstanding,

52:39.574 --> 52:41.826
I made a mistake and
then I give you the money.

52:45.580 --> 52:46.998
Give me that watch.

52:53.796 --> 52:55.798
It was my dad's.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.801
Then don't give me anything.

53:05.391 --> 53:07.310
This is worth a lot,
you better start talking.

53:14.191 --> 53:19.447
A week ago,
I was hunting snakes.

53:21.032 --> 53:25.578
- Snakes?
- Yes.

53:25.620 --> 53:29.081
venom is well paid. Skins too,

53:29.123 --> 53:33.794
- I was at Las Arenas.
- Is that where they are?

53:35.212 --> 53:37.006
That's where I saw them.

53:37.048 --> 53:39.592
But they are alright.

53:39.634 --> 53:43.012
Do you know why
they call it Las Arenas?

53:43.054 --> 53:45.514
That place is called Las Arenas

53:45.556 --> 53:47.058
because there's a lot of
quicksands,

53:47.099 --> 53:52.104
There's no quicksand in this
country; that's bullshit.

53:54.649 --> 53:59.028
Did you know I went hunting with
a friend, but I came back alone.

53:59.070 --> 54:01.822
If you don't want to believe me,
it's your problem,

54:01.864 --> 54:04.200
but they are in danger.

54:12.875 --> 54:16.420
Hey, buddy, I'm a doctor.

54:16.462 --> 54:19.382
I organized the conference here.
Let me out.

54:19.423 --> 54:22.843
I mean it;
My friends are in danger.

54:22.885 --> 54:25.972
If you want, call the manager.

54:26.013 --> 54:28.015
Let me out!

54:28.057 --> 54:31.060
( music playing )

54:31.102 --> 54:34.063
Josh: Fuck!

54:34.105 --> 54:36.857
- ( Sofia whispering )
- I won't calm down.

54:36.899 --> 54:40.569
I won't fucking calm down
'cause is fucking bullshit!

54:40.611 --> 54:43.447
- Just try. Try to relax!
- All we did was go on a hike!

54:43.489 --> 54:49.328
And now we're stuck in fucking--
fucking quicksand!

54:49.370 --> 54:52.081
But just try to relax,
all right?

54:52.123 --> 54:55.084
Fuck this fucking...

54:55.126 --> 54:56.794
( groans )

54:56.836 --> 54:59.588
...fucking place.

54:59.630 --> 55:03.092
Josh, the faster
your heart rate,

55:03.134 --> 55:05.928
the faster the venom spreads,
remember? Right?

55:05.970 --> 55:08.264
Mm-hmm.

55:08.305 --> 55:09.932
All right. Okay.

55:12.518 --> 55:14.311
Isn't that amazing?

55:16.731 --> 55:21.694
One minute I'm at a fucking
golf course with my buddies.

55:21.736 --> 55:24.697
My phone rings.
It's Marcos. He's like,

55:24.739 --> 55:29.118
"Hey, Josh, man,

55:29.160 --> 55:32.121
think Sof can join us
in Colombia for the conference?"

55:32.163 --> 55:35.124
Now look at us.
We're here in beautiful Bogota.

55:35.166 --> 55:37.710
I just got--

55:37.752 --> 55:42.506
I just got bitten by a fucking
giant venomous snake.

55:42.548 --> 55:45.676
- Stop. Stop.
- Fuck. Fuck.

55:45.718 --> 55:49.722
- Fuck.
- Let me see your arm.

55:49.764 --> 55:52.641
It's no use. Okay?

55:52.683 --> 55:53.934
It'll be no different than

55:53.976 --> 55:56.145
the last time
you looked at it, honey.

55:56.187 --> 55:59.940
Honey, honey.

55:59.982 --> 56:02.902
Honey, there's nothing
you can do for me.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.576
Can I ask you something?

56:12.787 --> 56:13.788
Yeah.

56:16.373 --> 56:18.667
Why did you change your mind?

56:21.212 --> 56:23.339
About what?

56:23.380 --> 56:26.175
About going hiking
with me and Marcos.

56:26.217 --> 56:28.385
I already told you.

56:32.014 --> 56:33.432
You sure there wasn't
something else?

56:35.392 --> 56:39.146
No. That was it.

56:41.023 --> 56:42.233
You blame me.

56:43.818 --> 56:46.070
For what?

56:46.112 --> 56:47.988
If I hadn't changed my mind,

56:48.030 --> 56:49.907
you'd be preparing
for your lecture.

56:49.949 --> 56:52.368
No. No, no, no.
I didn't say that.

56:52.409 --> 56:54.203
But it's true.

56:54.245 --> 56:55.996
Honey, don't put words
in my mouth. That's not what--

56:56.038 --> 56:58.040
Then why did you
bring it up now?

57:03.045 --> 57:04.630
I don't know.

57:04.672 --> 57:06.632
Because it's my fault?

57:10.636 --> 57:12.847
I'm so sorry.

57:12.888 --> 57:16.183
Me, too.

57:16.225 --> 57:18.602
Ah, fuck. Oh!

57:18.644 --> 57:20.813
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

57:20.855 --> 57:24.108
- Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.
- Let me see. Let me see.

57:28.070 --> 57:31.365
- Does it hurt?
- It hurts everywhere.

57:31.407 --> 57:32.741
Do you feel when
I press down here?

57:32.783 --> 57:34.285
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

57:35.619 --> 57:38.873
- Are they warm?
- Yeah.

57:38.914 --> 57:42.168
It's pretty hot.

57:42.209 --> 57:44.044
- I think it's thrombophlebitis.
- What?

57:44.086 --> 57:47.423
It's coagulating your blood,
turning it to Jell-O.

57:47.464 --> 57:48.841
At least dying by a stroke
is better than

57:48.883 --> 57:50.301
starving to death, right?

57:52.678 --> 57:54.096
Don't say that.

57:57.683 --> 57:59.602
What are you doing?

57:59.643 --> 58:03.063
What are you doing?
No, no. Sofia.

58:03.105 --> 58:04.773
There's a clot.

58:04.815 --> 58:07.443
It's blocking your
blood flow to your brain.

58:07.484 --> 58:10.321
You're gonna have a stroke.
I have to do this, all right?

58:10.362 --> 58:13.073
- Put down the knife.
- ( grunting )

58:13.115 --> 58:14.491
You haven't done
anything like this in years.

58:14.533 --> 58:18.078
I'm still a doctor.

58:18.120 --> 58:19.914
I'm gonna cut your clot,
all right?

58:23.542 --> 58:26.462
Honey. Baby, come on.

58:26.503 --> 58:27.922
Fuck.

58:29.006 --> 58:31.884
Just let me. All right?

58:31.926 --> 58:34.303
Why won't you let me?

58:34.345 --> 58:36.388
Because there's only
one bullet left.

58:36.430 --> 58:39.475
( music playing )

58:39.516 --> 58:41.477
You have to trust me
when I'm telling you

58:41.518 --> 58:42.853
we're gonna get out of this.

58:45.147 --> 58:46.565
No one's coming for us.

58:49.276 --> 58:52.321
- Let me. Oh, shit.
- Honey.

58:52.363 --> 58:56.116
No. Oh, my God.
It's getting worse. Jesus.

58:56.158 --> 58:58.535
- I have to do it now.
- I don't want you to.

59:00.955 --> 59:03.707
I've taken two oaths in my life.

59:03.749 --> 59:06.126
One as a doctor.

59:06.168 --> 59:08.504
One as a wife.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.047
You don't get to decide.

59:10.089 --> 59:12.716
( in Spanish )

59:12.758 --> 59:16.136
( in English )
Baby. Baby, look at me.

59:16.178 --> 59:17.638
It's gonna hurt.

59:20.391 --> 59:23.686
Yep.

59:23.727 --> 59:26.939
- Where you gonna cut?
- Carotid artery.

59:26.981 --> 59:28.857
Make sure you seal it up
when you're done?

59:28.899 --> 59:32.486
I won't let you bleed out,
believe me.

59:32.528 --> 59:35.197
I love you. I--

59:35.239 --> 59:36.240
- ( squelching )
- ( screams )

59:42.037 --> 59:44.999
We're almost there.
You're doing great, babe.

59:45.040 --> 59:47.376
- ( Josh screams )
- Almost done.

59:47.418 --> 59:48.544
We're almost there, babe.

59:48.585 --> 59:51.505
- ( screaming )
- Here.

59:55.009 --> 59:58.095
( hyperventilating )

59:58.137 --> 01:00:00.639
( moaning )

01:00:00.681 --> 01:00:01.682
Fuck.

01:00:05.436 --> 01:00:08.439
( Josh panting )
Oh, my God.

01:00:11.275 --> 01:00:14.028
( screams )

01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:16.864
( moaning )

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:21.243
( Sofia gasping )

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:30.836
( music playing )

01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:05.287
- Hi.
- ( chuckling )

01:01:07.498 --> 01:01:10.667
- How are you feeling?
- ( grunts )

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:14.046
My body is a little numb.

01:01:14.088 --> 01:01:16.465
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:17.925
Okay.

01:01:17.966 --> 01:01:20.219
It's in shock.

01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:22.930
How long was I out?

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.810
An hour, I guess.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:33.190
- You did it.
- We made it.

01:01:33.232 --> 01:01:35.692
You did it.

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:39.780
Thank you.

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:46.703
Do you remember what you said
before you passed out?

01:01:46.745 --> 01:01:48.705
Yeah.

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.127
Did you mean it?

01:01:55.504 --> 01:01:57.548
Did I mean it?

01:01:59.133 --> 01:02:01.343
Yeah, I did.

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:15.566
Do you think our kids already
know that we're missing?

01:02:19.945 --> 01:02:22.072
God, I hope not.

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:23.740
Yeah, maybe not.

01:02:31.165 --> 01:02:34.334
There's one thing that keeps
going through my mind

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:38.338
over and over in
this sick and stupid way.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.467
What's that?

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:43.385
That I'm not gonna
get to give that lecture.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:50.017
Isn't it crazy that
I'm so consumed with that?

01:02:50.058 --> 01:02:52.394
That is not crazy.

01:02:57.983 --> 01:03:00.194
No, it's not crazy.

01:03:03.614 --> 01:03:05.616
Maybe I just needed it.

01:03:07.993 --> 01:03:09.620
It was so important.

01:03:12.414 --> 01:03:15.751
Something to bring my confidence
back before I started work.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:18.754
You don't need
a lecture to do that.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:22.424
I do, though.
More than you think.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:30.307
- Josh, I was so good.
- Uh-huh.

01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:34.186
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I was really good.

01:03:34.228 --> 01:03:37.439
Top of our class.
The first to be published.

01:03:39.441 --> 01:03:42.903
I got staffed at the number one
hospital in the city.

01:03:42.945 --> 01:03:45.030
You're a great doctor.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:49.451
But then I stopped.

01:03:53.247 --> 01:03:55.415
I know I was making
the right decision.

01:03:55.457 --> 01:03:58.001
I still believe that.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:03:59.836
I wanted to be around
for the kids.

01:04:02.256 --> 01:04:06.468
But there's this thing
I just-- I just lost.

01:04:11.265 --> 01:04:14.017
I became a mother.

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:15.477
Your wife.

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:22.442
But somehow me?

01:04:22.484 --> 01:04:26.655
Me. Sofia.

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:28.949
It's so hard to find sometimes.

01:04:31.702 --> 01:04:33.287
I don't know where I am.

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:38.667
I still see the real you.

01:04:38.709 --> 01:04:41.378
You don't, though.

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:43.463
Should've said this
to you more often.

01:04:43.505 --> 01:04:46.842
- I should've-- no.
- Please stop.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:50.262
The sacrifice you made
to stop working?

01:04:50.304 --> 01:04:52.514
Stay home with our kids?

01:04:56.518 --> 01:04:58.604
They are so much better off
because of it.

01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:04.693
Sof, you're such
a good mother.

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:06.612
They are so lucky to have you.

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:09.323
I was so lucky to have you.

01:05:14.328 --> 01:05:16.288
I can't stop thinking
about them.

01:05:16.330 --> 01:05:20.125
- I know.
- Our home waiting for us.

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:24.129
I don't want them to be alone.

01:05:25.756 --> 01:05:27.090
I don't wanna leave them.

01:05:27.132 --> 01:05:29.718
They're going to be okay,
you know?

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:33.555
They're--
they're going to be okay.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:38.769
I love you.

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:41.563
I love you, too.

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:13.095
( wind blows )

01:06:22.396 --> 01:06:26.149
So I need eight more feet
to lasso that rock.

01:06:26.191 --> 01:06:28.777
Hmm. Maybe, yeah.

01:06:28.819 --> 01:06:29.820
The snake.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:33.407
It's longer than eight feet.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.576
Okay, what do you mean?

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:39.287
It's thick. It won't break.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:42.582
- Uh-huh.
- We can use it as a rope.

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:45.794
I don't think the snake's
gonna let you tie it

01:06:45.836 --> 01:06:48.296
to a rope backpack
around its head.

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:51.425
I'm gonna kill it.

01:06:54.845 --> 01:06:57.305
I need to get you out of this.

01:06:57.347 --> 01:07:00.392
- Honey?
- Mm.

01:07:00.434 --> 01:07:04.312
That snake might be
miles away from here by now.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:06.606
No, it is near.

01:07:06.648 --> 01:07:10.402
It's a mother
protecting her eggs.

01:07:10.444 --> 01:07:12.028
She must be around here.

01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:15.741
Her nest. Its nest.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:19.327
It must be around here.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:22.247
- We just need to find it.
- Okay.

01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:49.441
( grunting )

01:07:53.695 --> 01:07:55.906
( grunting )

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:07.334
Yes. It's right there.

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:09.377
Honey.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:10.879
I can't turn my head.

01:08:10.921 --> 01:08:12.798
Don't try to.

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:15.509
I'm not gonna be able
to help you.

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:21.264
Don't try.

01:08:21.306 --> 01:08:24.476
Just stay calm.
Stay with me.

01:08:24.518 --> 01:08:27.270
- You'll be fine. I'll do it.
- Yeah.

01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:30.273
All right? I can do it.

01:08:30.315 --> 01:08:31.733
Just stay with me.

01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:35.737
( echoing )
Stay with me.

01:08:35.779 --> 01:08:36.947
Stay with me.

01:08:52.337 --> 01:08:58.093
( grunting, panting )

01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:15.986
( hissing, slithering )

01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:16.987
( Sofia whimpers )

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:19.155
( panting )

01:09:24.578 --> 01:09:27.956
- ( hissing )
- ( grunts )

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:43.471
( hissing )

01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:59.821
( whimpering )

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:25.722
( screams, groans )

01:10:28.725 --> 01:10:31.728
( gasping )

01:10:34.773 --> 01:10:37.317
( moaning )

01:10:48.411 --> 01:10:53.875
( music playing )

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.556
( music continues )

01:11:15.689 --> 01:11:18.900
( gasps, screams )

01:11:21.277 --> 01:11:23.780
( both grunting )

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:34.290
Get us out of here.

01:11:57.147 --> 01:12:01.443
( grunting )

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:14.330
( grunting, panting )

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:50.116
( screams )

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.206
Did you get it?
Did you get it?

01:12:57.791 --> 01:12:59.584
- Did you get it?
- ( laughs )

01:13:03.505 --> 01:13:04.964
Just stay with me, all right?

01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:07.759
( Josh muttering )

01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:08.968
( laughs )

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:14.516
( Josh whispering )

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:19.145
( grunting )

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:26.194
( laughing quietly )

01:13:26.236 --> 01:13:29.072
( groans )
Yeah.

01:13:35.203 --> 01:13:36.621
( screams )

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.052
( screams )

01:13:54.264 --> 01:13:56.432

01:14:02.856 --> 01:14:06.860

01:14:15.076 --> 01:14:16.870
( grunts )

01:14:22.667 --> 01:14:24.002
Baby.

01:14:25.879 --> 01:14:27.881
Josh. Josh!

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:30.508
Josh. Josh.

01:14:34.387 --> 01:14:36.890
Hey. Grab my hand.

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:39.058
( laughs )

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:41.060
You made it.

01:14:41.102 --> 01:14:42.562
Baby!

01:14:42.604 --> 01:14:43.855
Grab my hand!

01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:45.106
I can't.

01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:47.734
Yes, you can.

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:50.486
I can't move.

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:52.989
Baby.

01:14:53.031 --> 01:14:56.868
- You gotta go get help.
- No, no, no.

01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:59.078
- We have no time. Baby.
- Go get help.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.455
- I'm not gonna leave you.
- Go get help.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:02.582
No, no. No. No.

01:15:02.624 --> 01:15:04.459
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.127
Go.

01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:26.105
( gasping )

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:30.735
( breathing slows )
