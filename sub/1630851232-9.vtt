11:04.098 --> 11:05.665
- Okay. Well, you're safe here.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.971
- They can't come into
the hospital, can they?

11:08.015 --> 11:11.975
- They could, but they won't.
We're a sensitive location too.

11:12.019 --> 11:13.760
- Yeah, but they're going
to be waiting out there.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.805
- Which is why we're not
discharging any patients

11:15.849 --> 11:19.200
who came in from the church.
Spread the word--code 935.

11:19.243 --> 11:21.202
- On it.

11:24.858 --> 11:26.773
- You're gonna
let those things eat me?

11:26.816 --> 11:28.383
- You ready?

11:28.426 --> 11:30.646
- Hey, will I feel them?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.387
- You're on a lot
of pain medication

11:32.430 --> 11:35.259
but they might tickle a little.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.131
And we'll be right here
the whole time.

11:37.174 --> 11:39.568
- Yeah. Maggots have been
used in medicine

11:39.611 --> 11:42.223
for thousands of years,
and they're the best way

11:42.266 --> 11:44.965
to get all the dead tissue
off your legs.

11:45.008 --> 11:48.316
- And the best part is
they're picky eaters.

11:48.359 --> 11:50.405
They only like the dead skin

11:50.448 --> 11:53.713
so they leave all the nice
clean living tissue.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.540
- And after they're all done,

11:55.584 --> 11:58.718
we'll be able to apply
new skin grafts to your legs.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.546
- Attention,
we are in code 935.

12:01.590 --> 12:05.333
I repeat, the hospital
is now in code 935.

12:05.376 --> 12:07.814
- What's code 935?
- ICE.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.685
- Immigration's here?
- You're safe, Yakub.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.384
- Just relax,
focus on getting better.

12:20.435 --> 12:22.132
- I used to see the, uh,

12:22.176 --> 12:24.047
ICE van
at the church every day

12:24.091 --> 12:26.354
just sitting there waiting,

12:26.397 --> 12:28.486
so scared they'll take me
and my sister

12:28.530 --> 12:31.925
and put us in one
of those places...

12:31.968 --> 12:34.405
those jails.

12:36.581 --> 12:39.671
So I burned our papers.

12:43.371 --> 12:46.417
- Yakub...

12:46.461 --> 12:47.941
did you start the fire?

12:50.682 --> 12:53.424
- I tried to stomp it out,

12:53.468 --> 12:56.688
but it destroyed everything.

12:56.732 --> 12:59.561
I destroyed everything.
[sniffles]

13:02.303 --> 13:04.566
I always mess things up...

13:06.873 --> 13:08.918
For me,

13:08.962 --> 13:10.877
my sister...

13:13.967 --> 13:15.751
Everyone.

13:23.498 --> 13:24.978
- Okay, Rahel, hi.

13:25.021 --> 13:27.894
So tell me about
these talks with God.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.634
How long have
they been happening?

13:29.678 --> 13:32.115
- For as long as I can
remember.

13:32.159 --> 13:35.553
- Okay. So they started
before you came to America?

13:35.597 --> 13:38.643
- They happen more now.
Almost every day.

13:38.687 --> 13:40.297
- Almost every day.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.952
What about your little brother?
Does he, um, talk with God?

13:42.996 --> 13:46.651
- Not unless God is on
WhatsApp, plays Minecraft.

13:46.695 --> 13:51.178
- [laughs] Okay, so typical
little kid, check.

13:51.221 --> 13:53.571
- I know you think I'm crazy.

13:53.615 --> 13:57.271
I'm not even sure if
Father O'Connell believes me,

13:57.314 --> 13:58.707
even though everything
he preaches

13:58.750 --> 14:01.841
is about talking with God...

14:01.884 --> 14:05.192
even though the Bible is full
of people who talk with God.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.584
- Yeah. First of all,

14:06.628 --> 14:08.804
I do not think you're crazy,
for the record.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.546
And secondly,
we all talk to God, right?

14:11.589 --> 14:14.288
Or some version of our
perception of God, anyway.

14:14.331 --> 14:16.856
So no, I don't think
you're crazy.

14:18.640 --> 14:22.687
What do the talks feel like?
Can you explain it?

14:23.863 --> 14:25.908
- Love.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.910
It feels like love.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.999
- Love is good.

14:30.043 --> 14:33.220
Okay. And it just happens
out of the blue?

14:33.263 --> 14:35.178
- I guess so.

14:35.222 --> 14:38.878
I just light incense
and focus, and it happens.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.881
- Okay, simple enough.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.666
- You really don't think
I'm crazy?

14:44.709 --> 14:47.930
- I really do not think
you're crazy, okay?

14:47.974 --> 14:51.891
You're no crazier than this guy
right here, or me, you know?

14:51.934 --> 14:54.545
And that's saying something.
I don't think you're crazy.

14:54.589 --> 14:55.895
I think you're a caring,

14:55.938 --> 14:58.549
intuitive and spiritual
human being.

14:58.593 --> 15:00.900
And lucky.

15:00.943 --> 15:04.338
But I am going to need to
ask you for a few more tests.

15:04.381 --> 15:06.209
You can trust me.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.733
- I don't trust anyone.

15:08.777 --> 15:11.519
That's how me and my brother
made it this far.

15:11.562 --> 15:14.435
- Okay. I understand that.

15:14.478 --> 15:18.569
But, Rahel,
if I'm gonna help you,

15:18.613 --> 15:21.224
I'm gonna need you
to trust me.

15:21.268 --> 15:22.922
Just a little.

15:25.576 --> 15:27.665
- I'll admit,
it's not the most welcoming,

15:27.709 --> 15:30.059
but it will tell us
what to make of the discharge.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.974
- I can tell you
from personal experience

15:32.018 --> 15:34.194
that getting a mammogram sucks.

15:34.237 --> 15:38.459
It's like stepping back
into a body that isn't mine.

15:38.502 --> 15:41.070
Does that sound familiar?

15:41.114 --> 15:43.159
So for people like us,
trans men,

15:43.203 --> 15:45.422
it's tempting
to ignore cancer screenings

15:45.466 --> 15:49.252
and walk away from God-awful
machines like this one.

15:49.296 --> 15:52.342
- Yes, I know.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.301
But you don't understand.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.781
- But we're willing to try.

15:56.825 --> 16:00.220
You said you're from Nigeria,
yes?

16:02.222 --> 16:03.963
Did they hurt you there?

16:07.053 --> 16:12.275
- I don't need to tell you the
terrible things that happened.

16:12.319 --> 16:14.886
I'm alive.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.019
I'm here.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.979
This body, which they tried
to destroy...

16:22.764 --> 16:24.722
All I can do...

16:24.766 --> 16:28.030
the best thing I can do
is to fill it with love.

16:29.684 --> 16:31.816
This body my home.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.036
- And you want to
protect your home.

16:35.603 --> 16:38.998
- I can't put myself
in that machine.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.610
- Okay. It's all right.

16:42.653 --> 16:45.134
It's okay.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.180
Sorry. Okay.

16:49.791 --> 16:50.966
- Do you wanna get arrested
and go to jail?

16:51.010 --> 16:52.315
Because if you don't
step aside--

16:52.359 --> 16:53.751
- Okay, he's not the one
you have to worry about--

16:53.795 --> 16:54.883
- All right. All right.
What is the issue?

16:54.926 --> 16:56.276
- They're trying to
make an arrest.

16:56.319 --> 16:57.842
- Okay. I'm Max Goodwin,
the medical director here.

16:57.886 --> 16:59.366
I'm going to have to ask you
to turn around

16:59.409 --> 17:00.802
and walk out of here

17:00.845 --> 17:02.673
or I'm going to report you
for violating HIPAA laws.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.110
- Dr. Goodwin,
I'm sorry we have to meet

17:04.153 --> 17:06.068
under these circumstances,
but I have a warrant here

17:06.112 --> 17:07.678
for the arrest
of Salvador Perez,

17:07.722 --> 17:09.115
and I have a judge
issuing warrants

17:09.158 --> 17:11.030
for every undocumented
that you're harboring.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.989
- This is a warrant for missing
an immigration hearing.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.425
- I don't make the laws,
Dr. Goodwin,

17:15.469 --> 17:16.861
I just enforce them.

17:16.905 --> 17:17.993
- He probably missed
the hearing

17:18.037 --> 17:18.994
because you were staking
out his church

17:19.038 --> 17:20.691
and he was terrified to leave.

17:20.735 --> 17:22.345
Do you really want
to walk into this hospital

17:22.389 --> 17:24.043
and start arresting people?

17:24.086 --> 17:26.219
- We respected the church
as a sanctuary,

17:26.262 --> 17:28.438
but this doesn't look
like a church to me.

17:28.482 --> 17:30.005
So you can either
help us do our job

17:30.049 --> 17:32.051
or you can get out of the way.

17:35.793 --> 17:38.144
- All right, everybody,
quickly inside.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.537
Let's move some of these tables
and make some room.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.887
Hi there, so sorry about this.
Do you mind if I, uh...

17:42.931 --> 17:45.499
There you go.
Enjoying the pasta?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.892
- Max, we appreciate
what you're doing,

17:47.936 --> 17:50.025
but I don't see
how hiding in a cafeteria

17:50.069 --> 17:51.635
is going to protect anyone.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.202
- You're absolutely right.
Do you have your rosary on you?

17:53.246 --> 17:55.074
- Of course.

17:56.118 --> 17:59.817
- If ICE can come into
our hospital but not a church,

17:59.861 --> 18:02.472
well, we'll have to make do.

18:02.516 --> 18:04.474
With your blessing, Father,

18:04.518 --> 18:07.608
welcome to your new sanctuary.

18:26.322 --> 18:28.063
I bet you've got
quite a few sins

18:28.107 --> 18:30.413
you'd like to
get off your chest.

18:30.457 --> 18:33.634
- I can't believe
that I have to say this,

18:33.677 --> 18:36.854
but you cannot hide a bunch
of undocumented immigrants

18:36.898 --> 18:38.378
in our cafeteria.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.249
- Well, they're not just
undocumented immigrants,

18:40.293 --> 18:42.208
Mrs. Trahn right there,

18:42.251 --> 18:45.167
she was a nanny
for Manhattan families

18:45.211 --> 18:46.821
for about three decades.

18:46.864 --> 18:49.302
And that's Daniel there--
he crossed the border

18:49.345 --> 18:50.825
pretty much by himself
to find his mother.

18:50.868 --> 18:53.349
And the little boy
he's playing with is Nelson,

18:53.393 --> 18:55.873
one of the brightest boys
you'll ever meet.

18:55.917 --> 18:59.007
And he's just waiting
for the day to go to school.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.357
- Please don't try to appeal
to my sense of humanity, Max.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.664
- No? Okay. How about this.
They're our patients,

19:03.707 --> 19:05.492
and it's going to be
pretty hard to treat them

19:05.535 --> 19:08.495
when they're being
dragged away in vans.

19:12.063 --> 19:14.196
- And, uh,
where will they sleep?

19:14.240 --> 19:18.592
Hmm? Where will they go
to the bathroom, Max?

19:18.635 --> 19:22.030
ICE is here legally executing
warrants set by a judge,

19:22.073 --> 19:23.988
and I highly doubt
they're going to just drop them

19:24.032 --> 19:26.817
because you decided
to hide them in a hospital.

19:26.861 --> 19:29.342
And again, for the record,

19:29.385 --> 19:32.780
we are a hospital
and not a refugee center, Max.

19:32.823 --> 19:35.217
- You really think ICE
is going to give them

19:35.261 --> 19:37.263
the medical care they need?
- You know what?

19:37.306 --> 19:39.743
I'm willing to let
the government do their job

19:39.787 --> 19:42.093
and to let
this hospital do ours.

19:42.137 --> 19:45.662
So Church Amsterdam is over.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.711
I cannot believe
that you put up with this

19:50.754 --> 19:53.496
for three years.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.765
- I can't do it.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.811
I can't send that boy
to a detention center.

20:05.247 --> 20:07.206
- Neither can I.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.035
Maybe neither of us
has what it takes

20:11.079 --> 20:12.602
to make the hard decisions.

20:12.646 --> 20:15.692
Maybe we can still
make the right ones.

20:17.085 --> 20:18.956
There's a board meeting
tonight.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.262
I'll call for a vote

20:20.306 --> 20:23.483
to terminate
Dr. Fuentes' contract.

20:23.526 --> 20:25.136
- Really?

20:25.180 --> 20:28.270
Do you have the votes
to pull that off?

20:28.314 --> 20:30.185
- Not yet.

20:31.752 --> 20:34.102
But I'll find them.

20:34.145 --> 20:36.278
- Carol Brantley.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.498
Didn't know
you had it in ya.

20:41.675 --> 20:46.375
- So, Temi,
this is a transducer table.

20:46.419 --> 20:49.204
You'll lie face-down
with your chest in the water,

20:49.248 --> 20:52.294
and the ultrasound signals
will show us what's going on.

20:52.338 --> 20:55.297
No compression, no pain.

20:55.341 --> 20:59.170
- It's not perfect, but it is
the best that we can offer.

20:59.214 --> 21:01.651
I do hope you'll trust us.

22:50.978 --> 22:52.327
- Okay, Rahel.

22:52.371 --> 22:56.113
So we, um, looked at your
scans, and it turns out

22:56.157 --> 22:59.726
that your visions are actually
temporal lobe seizures.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.597
People call them
Dostoevsky seizures

23:01.641 --> 23:03.469
because we think that
that's what he had,

23:03.512 --> 23:05.645
the, um, the writer.

23:05.688 --> 23:07.864
- I'm having seizures?

23:07.908 --> 23:09.431
- So you know the incense
that you light

23:09.475 --> 23:10.954
as part of your ritual?

23:10.998 --> 23:15.002
That incense, oddly enough,
is was is bringing them on.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.352
The smoke is reducing
the amount of oxygen

23:17.396 --> 23:19.136
to your brain and--
[snaps]

23:19.180 --> 23:20.442
- Wait, no.

23:20.486 --> 23:22.923
No, you might see
a seizure on the scan,

23:22.966 --> 23:25.795
but I know how I feel--
I know I'm talking to God.

23:25.839 --> 23:28.058
- That's the thing about
these Dostoevsky seizures.

23:28.102 --> 23:30.974
They can feel...inspiring.

23:31.018 --> 23:34.804
They can feel blissful,
like you're in another world.

23:34.848 --> 23:37.981
But left untreated,
they can cause brain damage.

23:38.025 --> 23:41.245
The good news is that
they are very treatable

23:41.289 --> 23:42.551
and I just so happen

23:42.595 --> 23:44.292
to have a medication
you can start today.

23:44.335 --> 23:47.991
- I don't want that.
I help people.

23:48.035 --> 23:51.908
Back home, I stopped my aunt's
migraines and people at church,

23:51.952 --> 23:53.519
they come to me.

23:53.562 --> 23:56.870
I can carry their suffering.
Why would you take that away?

23:56.913 --> 24:00.482
- Okay. Yes, you would
stop having

24:00.526 --> 24:03.790
this very profound
spiritual experience.

24:03.833 --> 24:07.707
But again, if we don't treat
your epilepsy,

24:07.750 --> 24:09.970
your seizures
will go from temporal lobe

24:10.013 --> 24:11.928
to full tonic-clonic.

24:11.972 --> 24:14.322
And I know you feel like you
can control them right now.

24:14.365 --> 24:17.194
But eventually, believe me,
they will control you.

24:17.238 --> 24:19.458
- But what about Yakub?

24:19.501 --> 24:21.503
He still needs me.

24:21.547 --> 24:22.852
- Yes, he does.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.419
Yakub will need you
when he gets better.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.855
That is absolutely correct.

24:25.899 --> 24:28.075
But if you don't manage
your epilepsy,

24:28.118 --> 24:31.034
you won't be the sister
that he knows.

24:31.078 --> 24:34.603
I know what it's like
to lose a sibling,

24:34.647 --> 24:37.432
and I'm not going to
let that happen to Yakub.

24:39.782 --> 24:42.306
- All right. Let's go ahead
and remove the epinephrine pads

24:42.350 --> 24:43.830
and see what we got.

24:43.873 --> 24:45.396
- Bleeding's controlled.
- Right on.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.312
Let's go ahead
and apply some skin.

24:48.356 --> 24:53.013
All right. Set me up with
a 2-0 chromic on an SH.

24:53.056 --> 24:56.233
- You prefer that over
the PS3 needles?

24:56.277 --> 24:57.408
- It's a little bit more work,

24:57.452 --> 24:59.236
but it's less traumatic
on the skin,

24:59.280 --> 25:02.239
and this boy
doesn't need any more trauma.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.764
- When I came here,
I couldn't shake the fear

25:04.807 --> 25:07.462
that I would lose
everything any minute.

25:07.506 --> 25:12.032
When you feel like that, you do
whatever you can to survive.

25:12.075 --> 25:14.948
You even put out fires
with your bare hands and feet.

25:17.341 --> 25:18.429
- You okay?

25:18.473 --> 25:21.258
- I am now.

25:21.302 --> 25:23.260
I'm one of the lucky ones.

25:23.304 --> 25:24.827
[rapid beeping]

25:24.871 --> 25:28.701
- Heart rate's 120,
BP's 160/80 and rising,

25:28.744 --> 25:30.920
and his throat's swelling
around the ET tube.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.966
- He's got cervical
compartment syndrome.

25:33.009 --> 25:35.055
If we don't relieve
the pressure around his neck,

25:35.098 --> 25:37.057
he'll suffocate.
- All right, ChloraPrep.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.102
Give me a scalpel
and retractors.

25:39.146 --> 25:42.584
Let's prep
for cervical faciotomy.

25:42.628 --> 25:45.065
[rapid beeping continues]

25:47.633 --> 25:48.982
- You paged?

25:49.025 --> 25:50.549
- We've got a problem
with Church Amsterdam.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.812
- More ICE again?
- Definitely not ICE.

25:56.642 --> 25:59.601
- Where did they all come from?
- They're from New Amsterdam.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.168
When we called code 935,

26:01.211 --> 26:03.605
every undocumented patient
in the hospital

26:03.649 --> 26:05.172
was diverted here by staff.

26:05.215 --> 26:06.869
And now...
- They're afraid to leave.

26:06.913 --> 26:09.306
- Well, wouldn't you be
with ICE circling the building?

26:09.350 --> 26:11.613
- But this is--
- Completely unsustainable.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.397
I mean, they can't stay here,

26:13.441 --> 26:15.182
and we can't just
kick them out.

26:15.225 --> 26:16.879
What are we gonna do?

26:16.923 --> 26:21.057
[tense, percussive music]

26:24.060 --> 26:24.278
.

26:24.321 --> 26:27.716
[indistinct radio chatter]

26:27.760 --> 26:31.981
- Where are you taking me, Max?
- What do you think?

26:34.157 --> 26:35.811
It's perfect.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.857
- For what, exactly?

26:37.900 --> 26:40.642
- Your new sanctuary.
With all the new parishioners,

26:40.686 --> 26:43.514
you're gonna need a lot more
space, and we can spruce it up.

26:43.558 --> 26:45.560
- Max, I don't think--
- I know it's not ideal,

26:45.604 --> 26:47.649
but I bet that's exactly
what your church thought

26:47.693 --> 26:48.998
when it first opened its doors,

26:49.042 --> 26:51.871
what every church
or temple or mosque thinks

26:51.914 --> 26:53.655
when they open their doors.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.658
This isn't why we built
these places of worship

26:56.702 --> 26:58.051
and yet it's exactly why,

26:58.094 --> 26:59.922
to shelter people
from the storm,

26:59.966 --> 27:01.968
to harbor those who have
nowhere else to go,

27:02.011 --> 27:03.230
who have left
their homes behind.

27:03.273 --> 27:05.145
And if churches
can be sanctuaries,

27:05.188 --> 27:07.060
then why not hospitals?

27:07.103 --> 27:09.236
We've got medical care,
food, shelter,

27:09.279 --> 27:12.065
we've got a school right here.

27:12.108 --> 27:15.242
Why not us?

27:15.285 --> 27:18.637
- What about the people
who have jobs

27:18.680 --> 27:22.031
and families
waiting for them across town?

27:22.075 --> 27:25.905
Look, they don't need
another place to hide.

27:25.948 --> 27:27.602
They need a home.

27:27.646 --> 27:32.607
One that they're not afraid
to leave or come back to.

27:32.651 --> 27:36.785
A-a real sanctuary,
it provides safety,

27:36.829 --> 27:38.918
protection.

27:38.961 --> 27:42.835
A real sanctuary...

27:42.878 --> 27:44.663
it's a sacred space.

27:47.056 --> 27:49.842
You're not built
to provide that.

27:49.885 --> 27:52.845
And don't blame yourself
for not providing it either.

27:52.888 --> 27:54.324
All right?

28:01.201 --> 28:03.290
- Firing Dr. Fuentes?

28:03.333 --> 28:05.292
How many of us
are on board with this plan?

28:05.335 --> 28:06.728
- You're the first
one I've talked to.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.164
- Well, to protect myself,

28:08.208 --> 28:09.949
I'd prefer to be
the last one you talk to.

28:09.992 --> 28:12.081
- I understand.
- Do you?

28:12.125 --> 28:14.649
What will this look like?
We just hired her.

28:14.693 --> 28:17.130
- I'm more concerned what it
will look like if we keep her.

28:17.173 --> 28:18.958
- I was wondering when
you would come around.

28:19.001 --> 28:20.437
I'm in.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.744
- You're one of many now,
I can assure you.

28:22.788 --> 28:23.919
- But do we have enough?

28:23.963 --> 28:25.312
- I'm working on it.

28:25.355 --> 28:26.574
- Have you talked to
Evan Nashton?

28:26.617 --> 28:28.054
- Not yet.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.316
- Get his vote,
and you'll have mine.

28:29.359 --> 28:31.492
- I didn't know Evan
carried so much sway.

28:31.535 --> 28:34.103
- Quite the opposite.
He's the weakest link.

28:34.147 --> 28:37.193
If you can convince him,
the rest will follow.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.021
Including me.

28:41.676 --> 28:44.113
- Almost half the board is in,
but I need your vote,

28:44.157 --> 28:45.854
the strongest vote,
so the rest will follow.

28:45.898 --> 28:48.814
- So you've chosen to court me
in the stairwell.

28:48.857 --> 28:51.773
- So are you in or out?
- [stammers, huffs]

28:51.817 --> 28:54.733
Veronica's done some good
things for this place--

28:54.776 --> 28:55.908
fattened our bottom line,

28:55.951 --> 28:57.518
and I heard about
the pasta bar.

28:57.561 --> 28:59.825
- Now a combination pasta bar
immigration camp.

28:59.868 --> 29:01.609
- Exactly!

29:01.652 --> 29:04.438
You can't blame Veronica
for trying to restore order.

29:04.481 --> 29:07.354
We hired her to clean up
this mess that Max has made--

29:07.397 --> 29:10.357
keeps making.
- But at what cost?

29:10.400 --> 29:12.359
These people came here
for our help, to heal.

29:12.402 --> 29:13.795
And if Veronica has her way,

29:13.839 --> 29:16.015
we'll end up putting them
in detention camps.

29:16.058 --> 29:18.408
- There's no easy answer,
Karen.

29:18.452 --> 29:20.759
- No, but there's a human one.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.718
Evan, we both joined the board
because we knew in our hearts

29:23.762 --> 29:27.548
New Amsterdam was special,
this place has a soul.

29:27.591 --> 29:29.376
It makes me a better person
every day.

29:29.419 --> 29:32.031
Hell, it even made you
a better one.

29:32.074 --> 29:33.815
If we don't take action now,

29:33.859 --> 29:36.687
that soul will be gone,
maybe forever.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.560
I'm asking for your vote.

29:41.910 --> 29:46.088
- All right. You're the boss.
You have my support.

29:46.132 --> 29:49.439
- [exhales] Thank you.

29:51.659 --> 29:55.097
- That should be
the last of the tumor.

29:56.707 --> 29:58.100
Scalpel.

29:59.885 --> 30:03.627
Going to extend
the surgical field laterally.

30:06.282 --> 30:09.677
- Lynn, the margins
aren't clear.

30:11.244 --> 30:12.723
We couldn't see it
on the ultrasound,

30:12.767 --> 30:14.595
but the tumor has invaded
the chest wall.

30:14.638 --> 30:17.250
- The mastectomy
won't be enough.

30:24.648 --> 30:25.954
- Dr. Frome!

30:25.998 --> 30:27.782
- Rahel, what happened?

30:27.826 --> 30:29.653
- I can't take the medicine
you gave me.

30:29.697 --> 30:30.785
- Why not?

30:30.829 --> 30:32.439
- My brother,
he's still in surgery!

30:32.482 --> 30:34.310
- Yeah, I heard.
And he's in good hands.

30:34.354 --> 30:36.443
- He's supposed to be out
by now.

30:36.486 --> 30:39.881
But I need to help him.
I need God to help him.

30:41.491 --> 30:45.408
- Okay...[ahem] I understand
that you want to help him.

30:45.452 --> 30:47.062
But I'm not going
to let you give yourself

30:47.106 --> 30:48.281
a seizure to do it.

30:48.324 --> 30:49.891
That would be unethical
and dangerous.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.110
- My brother needs me.

30:51.153 --> 30:52.285
- And he's getting
the best medical care.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.896
- And it's not working.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.899
I've protected my brother
his whole life,

30:57.943 --> 31:01.816
but only with God's help.
My prayers are not nothing.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.863
My prayers are--
they're all I have.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.475
If you could have saved
your own brother,

31:08.518 --> 31:10.999
wouldn't you have tried
everything...

31:11.043 --> 31:13.697
everything you could?

31:19.660 --> 31:21.531
- Are you sure
this is a good idea?

31:21.575 --> 31:24.491
- Um, objectively speaking?
No, this is a terrible idea.

31:24.534 --> 31:26.362
I can't make her take
the medication,

31:26.406 --> 31:28.277
so all I can do is be here
for her if I need to be.

31:28.321 --> 31:31.280
- "By the rivers of Babylon,
yea we wept

31:31.324 --> 31:34.370
"when we remembered Zion.

31:34.414 --> 31:37.678
On the willows there
we hung our harps."

31:37.721 --> 31:39.767
- "For there, our captors
asked of us songs,

31:39.810 --> 31:41.638
our tormentors demanded
songs of joy."

31:41.682 --> 31:45.338
- "They said to us,
'Sing us a song of Zion.'

may my right hand..."

32:05.924 --> 32:08.448
- Lauren, Lauren,
Lauren, Lauren, help me!

32:08.491 --> 32:10.711
- "They said to us,
'Sing us a song of Zion.'

while in a strange land?"

32:29.338 --> 32:31.210
- Little more tension.

32:31.253 --> 32:33.081
- Senn retractor.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.909
- Additional prophylaxis
on board.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.999
- Florescent light.
Dim the lights.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.480
The UV light will cause any
bacteria lurking inside

32:40.523 --> 32:41.568
to glow.
Testing.

32:41.611 --> 32:43.135
-...nominal here.
What do you have?

32:43.178 --> 32:44.832
- 33-40.

32:44.875 --> 32:46.399
- Okay, we're in the clear.
- If we're lucky,

32:46.442 --> 32:49.184
we won't see any.
Thank you.
