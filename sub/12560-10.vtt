00:00.520 --> 00:01.589
I'm hank.

00:01.640 --> 00:05.390
I was your typicalemergency
room doctor...Until I got fired.

00:05.460 --> 00:08.800
You let a billionairehospital trustee
die to save some kidoff the street.

00:08.850 --> 00:10.890
- I made a judgment call.
- You made a mistake.

00:10.930 --> 00:13.640
- This is my brother.
- I'm evan R.Lawson,C.P.A.

00:13.740 --> 00:17.370
He took meaway from my
troubles and to the hamptons,

00:17.570 --> 00:20.940
and suddenly,I had a chance to
become a whole newkind of doctor.

00:21.010 --> 00:25.630
Turns out the wealthyand not-so-wealthy out
here could use a guywho makes house calls,

00:47.170 --> 00:48.360
it's amazing.

00:48.410 --> 00:52.160
You can actually sew upa human being,but
you can't wrap somethingwith parallel sides.

00:52.270 --> 00:56.370
You know,I wentto medical school,not
the american academyof gift giving.

00:56.740 --> 00:59.070
So you want to go
halfsieson his present?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.290
What,so you can tag alongto the party?

01:01.550 --> 01:04.300
NoWhat?No. 'Cause I consider
tuckera friend,actually.

01:04.370 --> 01:06.610
Uh,you consider everyonea friend.

01:06.730 --> 01:08.160
No,I--so
what?

01:08.240 --> 01:09.790
So that's not
friendship.It's schmoozing.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.930
You know,I-I bet you don'teven
know how old tucker is.

01:12.010 --> 01:15.440
I know he's too youngto like top gun and too
old to get a presentwrapped in the funny papers.

01:15.610 --> 01:17.340
He's 17,okay?

01:17.450 --> 01:19.980
So the scene may bea bit
sophisticated for you.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.770
Caught it.And,P.S.,He loves top gun.

01:24.880 --> 01:26.430
- That was impressive.
- I know.

01:35.220 --> 01:36.780
Happy birthday,tucker.

01:36.880 --> 01:38.370
Thanks,hank.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.010
Am I the first one here?

01:42.100 --> 01:44.790
No,actually,but I bet you're the last.

01:44.890 --> 01:48.270
Tucker's dad claimshe's flying in for
the occasion,so we had to cancelthe party.

01:48.360 --> 01:49.710
You canceled it.When?

01:49.770 --> 01:51.440
This morning on twitter.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.480
Twitter,right.I don'T...twit.

01:54.520 --> 01:55.770
- Tweet.
- Got it.

01:55.820 --> 01:58.500
Hey,thanksfor letting
me use the ba-- hank.

01:58.590 --> 01:59.520
Jill.

01:59.640 --> 02:01.000
She was the first one here.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.190
You don't twitter either?

02:02.310 --> 02:03.440
It's "tweet."

02:03.510 --> 02:04.630
- I guess we
should-- no.

02:04.700 --> 02:08.949
Stay for a sliceof
sugar-free,gluten-free,dairy-free chocolate cake.

02:09.020 --> 02:11.870
- Sounds festive,right?
- I'm guessinglibby baked it.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.670
We can celebratetucker's birthday
and jill's newsabout the clinic.

02:17.730 --> 02:19.960
There's newsabout the clinic?

02:20.080 --> 02:21.630
Uh,yeah.

02:21.680 --> 02:23.760
Boris sort of wrote mea blank check.

02:23.860 --> 02:24.610
Really?

02:24.710 --> 02:26.820
Yeah,but,libby,how did
you know about that?

02:26.880 --> 02:30.620
Well,as a cyberchondriac,I'm sort of
tapped into the localmedical community.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.370
And people are talking.

02:32.440 --> 02:35.910
Yeah,she'ssort of tapped in
like the pope'ssort of catholic.

02:36.540 --> 02:38.360
Where's my boy?

02:40.540 --> 02:42.430
Dad?You really made it.

02:42.550 --> 02:45.140
You didn't think I'd
missyour birthday,now,did you?

02:45.260 --> 02:47.140
I take the fifth.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.660
Ready for your present?

02:49.780 --> 02:50.850
Sure.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.800
There it is.

02:53.030 --> 02:55.140
Happy birthday,tucker.

02:57.630 --> 02:59.960
Bridgetis my new assistant.

03:07.290 --> 03:08.870
Thanks.

03:15.900 --> 03:20.140
under this proposal,your employees would
enjoy the samehankmed benefits that you do.

03:20.210 --> 03:21.670
Friendswith benefits,I like.

03:21.750 --> 03:24.190
Employeeswith benefits,eh.

03:24.260 --> 03:27.880
Yeah,but bartendersand waitresses who don't
call in sick as muchmeans higher productivity,

03:27.940 --> 03:31.250
less turnover,and just a
healthierbottom line overall,so...

03:31.320 --> 03:34.740
well,I do appreciatea
healthy bottom line.

03:35.490 --> 03:36.840
Yeah,me too,man.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.400
Mr. Blackman,are you interested?

03:38.460 --> 03:40.760
My summer stafferscome
from russia,the balkans.

03:40.830 --> 03:42.990
They all want to come
hereand party in the hamptons.

03:43.050 --> 03:46.030
I want them to look good,work cheap.

03:46.070 --> 03:48.560
At the end of the summer,we
both go home happy.

03:48.650 --> 03:51.500
We'll haveyour results tomorrow,and
I will email youa full report.

03:51.570 --> 03:56.520
How about I email youan invitation
to tomorrow's private party?

03:56.600 --> 03:58.810
I don't mix businesswith pleasure.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.470
Uh,and I thinkthey're peas in a pod.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.640
I'll see you there,brother.

04:06.100 --> 04:08.060
Well,that man is offensive.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.710
That man is a role model.

04:09.800 --> 04:14.130
He's you.Uninterested in
anythingbeneath a woman's surface.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.089
I try to seebeneath their surface.

04:16.170 --> 04:18.160
That's why I stare so hard.

04:19.279 --> 04:21.649
I bet you've never
even hada female friend.

04:21.730 --> 04:22.780
Yes,I have.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.760
Oh,really?Well,who?

04:24.870 --> 04:26.850
- Does my mom count?
- No.

04:27.090 --> 04:29.750
- Do you count?
- Definitely not.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.200
All right.

04:31.260 --> 04:35.010
Yeah,I've neverhad a female
friend.That's interesting.So what?

04:35.060 --> 04:41.190
So until you're capableof seeing women as anythingmore
than objects,your relationshipswith them will fail.

04:41.240 --> 04:42.350
Oh,come on.

04:42.410 --> 04:44.700
Okay,what'sthe longest
relationship that you've been in?

04:45.310 --> 04:46.690
Eight months.

04:46.770 --> 04:48.260
Six months.

04:48.370 --> 04:49.680
Three and a half.

04:49.760 --> 04:51.080
I rest my case.

04:51.150 --> 04:54.820
Wha--divya.If I wantedto
have a female friend--

04:54.890 --> 04:57.920
- okay,if I wanted to,I could.
- Bye,evan.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.990
I think.

05:06.190 --> 05:08.740
How do you knowthis music?

05:08.830 --> 05:11.570
What,this?Digital handshake
factory.Are you kidding me?

05:11.680 --> 05:13.820
They're like the biggestalbanian
export since chrome.

05:13.900 --> 05:16.180
"They"?It's a guyand his laptop.

05:16.280 --> 05:20.200
No.What?God,that's heartbreaking.

05:20.380 --> 05:23.310
Ah,this musicis making me homesick.

05:23.380 --> 05:25.900
And I'm from poland,so
that's not easy to do.

05:26.050 --> 05:27.810
Czesc.

05:28.490 --> 05:31.460
Uh,excuse me.Hold up one sec.

05:35.770 --> 05:36.820
Here.

05:38.520 --> 05:41.790
- Welcome to new york.
- Really?

05:41.880 --> 05:46.170
Yeah.Just a friendly gesturefrom a friendly
guy to somebodywho could maybe use a friend.

05:46.230 --> 05:47.660
My number's right thereon my card.

05:47.740 --> 05:50.980
You can call me if you wantto talk music
or whatever-- just in a friendly way.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.520
"Hankmed.

05:52.610 --> 05:54.500
- "You're a doctor?
- No.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.350
I'm who the doctorworks for.

06:02.620 --> 06:06.770
So you didn't hearfrom boris
personally when he made the donation?

06:06.820 --> 06:08.840
- Nope.
- Yeah,I've been tryingto reach him.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.640
You can't just go next doorand knock?

06:11.510 --> 06:15.250
No,he's gone,and he hasn't
respondedto my messages.

06:15.880 --> 06:20.840
Hank,um,is there
somethingwrong with boris?

06:21.010 --> 06:22.130
Why do you ask?

06:22.210 --> 06:24.500
Hank!I think we're about to hug.

06:24.600 --> 06:26.500
- We are?
- I don't see any wayaround it.

06:26.620 --> 06:30.210
You're a good man.I would like to
bridgethe divide that's separated us.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.880
It's feeling bridgedas we speak.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.930
What the hellare you doing here?

06:35.060 --> 06:36.810
Let's open that present,huh?

06:36.970 --> 06:38.510
Yeah.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.770
Fancy wallet.

06:45.870 --> 06:47.410
Actually,it's a passport cover.

06:47.470 --> 06:51.170
Tucker and I are headed offto the
serengeti for a two-week safari.

06:51.260 --> 06:52.080
Just you and me?

06:52.180 --> 06:58.980
You,me,the roar of the lions,the silence of
the giraffes,and the laughing of the hyenas.

07:00.460 --> 07:02.270
That soundedlike a monkey.

07:02.370 --> 07:04.640
No,a monkey soundslike this.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.690
What's happening?Tucker!

07:14.810 --> 07:15.950
Oh,my god.

07:17.110 --> 07:18.270
What did she take?

07:18.390 --> 07:19.780
I have no idea.

07:19.890 --> 07:21.980
Here,empty this out for me.

07:23.540 --> 07:25.790
She's barely breathing,and
her pulse is weak.

07:26.650 --> 07:29.320
Bridget,stay awake for me!

07:29.490 --> 07:31.020
Tell me what you took.Bridget!

07:31.110 --> 07:32.830
My god.What is she on?

07:33.540 --> 07:35.190
Everything.

08:03.230 --> 08:04.520
We need an attending.

08:04.610 --> 08:08.270
26-year-old--pulse thready,bp
80,alcohol on board.

08:08.400 --> 08:11.140
Denies drug use,but her purse
was a walgreen's franchise--

08:11.190 --> 08:14.150
benzos,opiates,barbs,and
amphetamines.Let's go.

08:14.270 --> 08:16.310
When you said you had a
party,jill,you meant a party.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.260
We have a possible O.D.Here,doctor.

08:18.330 --> 08:19.650
No withdrawal to pain.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.740
Bridget,can you hear me?Bridget!

08:21.800 --> 08:23.620
You guys ever hear of an ambulance?

08:23.690 --> 08:26.930
Limo service of choice for emergencies.I can
write down the number for you if you'd like.

08:28.810 --> 08:30.920
No gag reflex.I need an intubation tray!

08:30.990 --> 08:35.179
After a nose dive,she regained consciousness and was
alert and responsive till we pulled into the parking lot.

08:35.350 --> 08:38.390
- Looks like she slid a few points on the glasgow scale.
- Yeah.

08:38.490 --> 08:39.750
No worries,hank.I got your back.

08:39.809 --> 08:42.620
Uh,get me a cbc,a chem 7,and a dsu 7.

08:42.700 --> 08:44.360
I need a cardiogram and a head scan.

08:44.450 --> 08:45.600
Here you go.

08:46.380 --> 08:48.740
Hey,you want to jump
in on the intubation?

08:48.820 --> 08:50.910
Come on,party girl might
appreciate the concierge touch.

08:50.970 --> 08:52.570
Yeah,I don't have privileges here.

08:52.650 --> 08:54.200
I'm not gonna snitch on you.

08:54.310 --> 08:55.900
What,are you afraid you're
a little rusty?Come on.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.800
Oh,just tube her,charlie,will you?

08:57.860 --> 09:00.210
Oh,she's so cute when she's bossy.

09:00.270 --> 09:01.980
Okay,we'll get out your way.

09:03.170 --> 09:06.590
Oh,her breath smells like acetone.You
might want to get an anion gap.

09:06.650 --> 09:10.070
You don't want to miss an
obvious ketoacidosis,doctor.

09:13.180 --> 09:15.300
If you're wondering,I
didn't tell him about us.

09:15.370 --> 09:16.730
Then he's a good guesser.

09:16.780 --> 09:18.690
Knowing charlie,he asked around.

09:19.380 --> 09:22.190
You know I had nothing to
do with hiring him back.

09:22.260 --> 09:25.260
Why do they even want him back?I thought
something went down,and he got fired.

09:25.330 --> 09:27.530
No,something went down,and
i almost got fired.

09:27.580 --> 09:28.900
The hospital loves him.

09:29.010 --> 09:32.870
No matterhow messy things get,charlie's
the guywho always comes out spotless,

09:32.920 --> 09:35.860
but I'm the girlwho always
gets stuck cleaning things up.

09:36.120 --> 09:37.210
Nice ex,huh?

09:37.270 --> 09:39.570
You're using "ex"pretty loosely,right?

09:39.760 --> 09:42.470
Hank,he was halfwayacross the globe.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.270
And now he's back.

09:46.470 --> 09:48.090
Excuse me.

09:49.610 --> 09:51.050
Hey,guys.

09:52.180 --> 09:53.150
Is she okay?

09:53.260 --> 09:54.850
She will be.You didn't need to come.

09:54.910 --> 09:56.700
You should've finishedyour
birthday dinner.

09:56.740 --> 09:58.210
Dad went to bed.

09:58.290 --> 10:00.880
He passed out,tucker.

10:02.300 --> 10:08.140
I thinkdad's drinking too much...
and maybe doing other stuff.

10:08.200 --> 10:14.930
It's at that point again where I never knowhow
he's gonna be-- up,like he was tonight,or down.

10:15.010 --> 10:17.770
Yeah,he did a stintat
hazelden a few years ago.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.070
- He just needs a break.
- He needs an intervention.

10:20.130 --> 10:22.220
Yeah,well,marshall bryantsitting
in a circle of chairs--

10:22.260 --> 10:24.980
even if they're eames
chairs--is never gonna happen.

10:25.020 --> 10:28.370
But I was thinkingthat
if you approached him,

10:28.440 --> 10:31.960
- you know,as a doctor...
- without sayingthat it was tucker's idea.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.940
Your dadwould listen to me?

10:35.030 --> 10:38.250
Yeah,you stood up to
him,and no one does that.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.300
And I think he respects it.

10:51.990 --> 10:54.000
I told himto check the rods.

10:54.130 --> 10:56.480
Only way to be sure
she'snever been rebuilt.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.490
- See there?
- Yeah.

11:01.250 --> 11:02.820
Yeah.See that down there?

11:02.920 --> 11:04.160
That's how you can tell.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.910
I-I hope I'm not interrupting.

11:07.050 --> 11:12.700
Oh,someone has to.When he gets startedon
front-engine ferraris,I clear my schedule for the day.

11:12.790 --> 11:14.400
I'm hereto check on bridget.

11:14.460 --> 11:16.830
The hospital saidthey discharged her.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.740
I discharged her too.

11:18.850 --> 11:22.720
It was poor judgmentto hire her and
worse to bring herto tucker's party.

11:22.840 --> 11:25.490
It's cool,dad.You've already apologized.

11:25.860 --> 11:27.600
Does anyone wantsome iced tea?

11:27.700 --> 11:29.400
Or somethinga big stronger,doc?

11:29.500 --> 11:31.260
No,thanks.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.180
Little early in the day,for me.

11:35.600 --> 11:39.140
Well,I'm gladyou stopped by.Tucker
needs immunizationsfor kenya.

11:39.190 --> 11:40.880
You think you could
hook him upwith that?

11:40.960 --> 11:43.750
Can't dr.Fitzsimmons handle it?

11:46.580 --> 11:49.370
You saw that someof bridget's
pills had my name on it,huh?

11:49.460 --> 11:54.120
Most of them.Prescribed by
dr.Feelgood fitz,who I checked up on.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.370
If you have an accusation,make it.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.810
No accusation--an
observation.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.990
Last nightyour pupils were
saucers.Today they're pinpoints.

12:02.050 --> 12:06.450
- So?
- So you're mixing uppersand opiates and chasing them with alcohol.

12:06.510 --> 12:09.180
That's bad news.We should
bevery worried about me.

12:09.220 --> 12:13.030
Well,the good news isyou still have
options.You haven't destroyedyour liver yet.

12:13.100 --> 12:16.290
- You're a man with resources.
- And you'rea man seeking resources.

12:16.380 --> 12:18.090
That's not what this is about.No?

12:18.190 --> 12:20.790
- Look,if you want to
makea change-- I don'T.

12:20.860 --> 12:23.070
And never mindabout the immunizations.

12:23.130 --> 12:28.320
Once again,hank... you're fired.

12:28.410 --> 12:30.830
Stop by again.We'll
go for the hat trick.

12:43.870 --> 12:45.130
you and meshould be friends.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.870
I mean it--just
only friends.

12:46.940 --> 12:48.960
Why don't we just becomefriends?

12:49.040 --> 12:50.810
I really thinkthat we should be friends.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.240
I'm a really good listener.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.500
Plus my bffjust became my "frenemy.

12:54.580 --> 12:55.730
" Love your necklace,by the way.

12:55.800 --> 12:59.200
You could do my nails.We
could play craniumor something.

12:59.260 --> 13:00.030
Do you like atari?

13:00.100 --> 13:03.440
What do friends do when
it's a guy and girl,you know?

13:03.930 --> 13:05.820
You know,they probablydon't
make out,right?

13:05.880 --> 13:07.310
That's not,like,a friendly game.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.060
So...

13:11.190 --> 13:15.270
Oh,no,sorry.Sorry.Just
waiting for...something.

13:19.770 --> 13:21.760
- Can I help you?
- Oh,actually,hi.

13:21.820 --> 13:23.560
Sorry,I was here.

13:35.110 --> 13:36.540
What is that?

13:36.700 --> 13:38.500
I made you a cd.

13:38.610 --> 13:39.750
No,you didn'T.

13:39.820 --> 13:41.410
My favorites.

13:41.540 --> 13:42.900
Oh,my god.

13:43.020 --> 13:44.980
Thank you.That's so cool.

13:45.110 --> 13:47.120
How do you say "friends"in polish?

13:47.190 --> 13:49.230
Przyjaciel.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.930
"Shayashell."

13:51.790 --> 13:53.600
Przyjaciel.

13:53.740 --> 13:55.560
I got to go.

13:55.640 --> 13:58.650
You know what?What are you,uh--
what are you doing tomorrow?

13:58.810 --> 14:01.840
Uh,it's my first day
off.Nothing.I'm sleeping.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.240
Do it with me.

14:03.370 --> 14:06.170
The--the nothing part.Obviously
not--not the sleeping part.

14:06.300 --> 14:09.100
We could hang out,like,go to the beach.

14:09.210 --> 14:11.130
I have a boyfriend.He works here.

14:11.220 --> 14:17.010
Perfect.All of us,we can
all be... "gerspatchel.

14:17.120 --> 14:18.660
- Przyjaciel.
- Yeah,that.

14:18.780 --> 14:20.100
- Sure.
- Yes?

14:20.170 --> 14:22.010
- Yes.
- Cool.High five.

14:22.170 --> 14:24.250
Sorry,that's an
american joke.We can hit.

14:24.320 --> 14:27.330
- Bam.Okay,cool.See you.
- Bye.

14:28.320 --> 14:29.670
Thanks for coming.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.970
- How's he doing?
- He's okay.

14:32.420 --> 14:34.710
Hey,tucker,I'm glad you called.

14:35.280 --> 14:38.380
As a hemophiliac,you
just can't take chances.

14:38.450 --> 14:40.860
- Well,it looks like it's
just-- internal bruising.

14:40.920 --> 14:44.320
Yeah.I broke out the
factor viiiright away.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.440
No other injuries,soreness?

14:46.560 --> 14:48.490
Nice work on the I.V.,By the way.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.100
You called him?

14:50.180 --> 14:51.570
No,I did.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.170
I thought you saidyou were all right.

14:53.290 --> 14:55.280
I am.I told her not to call.

14:55.340 --> 14:56.770
No.

14:56.860 --> 14:58.400
You should be examined.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.110
He slipped rushing downthe stairs.

15:00.180 --> 15:01.820
Yeah,trying to get out of here.

15:01.910 --> 15:04.150
I would've been taking themtwo
at a time,three at a time.

15:04.210 --> 15:05.890
Libby,easyon the saber rattling.

15:05.950 --> 15:07.210
It's true.

15:07.330 --> 15:10.520
We--we had an argument.Tucker
didn't want meto drink.

15:11.180 --> 15:12.930
- Is there any bleeding?
- No.

15:13.030 --> 15:16.870
- He's okay.
- He's lucky.He could've been hurt.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.730
That's the last thingI'd ever want.

15:18.850 --> 15:20.900
I'll live,dad.It's over.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.050
Okay,tucker.

15:22.150 --> 15:23.550
You know the drill now.

15:23.670 --> 15:27.250
- Yep.
- Monitor swelling,plenty of ice.

15:27.850 --> 15:32.140
But as your friendand a doctor,I can't let
you spend the nightin a high-risk environment.

15:32.220 --> 15:34.760
- He can stayat my place,hank.
- Okay,I'll give you both a ride.

15:34.820 --> 15:37.020
That's not necessary.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.080
Yes,it is.

15:39.750 --> 15:42.180
Come.Get whatever you need,tucker.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.980
So,uh,I-I need your help.

16:04.060 --> 16:07.470
Does it involvea paternity test,an
arrest warrant,or a hit man?

16:07.570 --> 16:09.150
No.Not--no,not
this time,no.

16:09.190 --> 16:10.760
Then what's up?

16:11.100 --> 16:16.780
Well,I'm taking this girlto the
beach,uh,but just as a friend.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.020
Go on.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.620
That's it.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.500
I'm not seeing the issue.

16:22.550 --> 16:24.880
I've never hada female friend before.

16:24.930 --> 16:29.320
And I--you know,I chalked it upto my basic
philosophy of "to know me is to want me.

16:29.390 --> 16:33.440
" You know,and to want a womanto be my
friend only,like,that justdoesn't compute.

16:33.490 --> 16:37.560
It feels unnatural to
me.Like,how--like,how--how--how do you do that?

16:38.490 --> 16:40.080
All right.

16:40.280 --> 16:44.430
You know how peoplewho don't like public
speaking are told to picturepeople naked?

16:44.480 --> 16:46.920
Yes,yes,so as notto
be intimidated,uh-huh.

16:46.970 --> 16:49.310
Exactly.Okay,so you try the opposite.

16:49.420 --> 16:55.660
Picture her as someonewho is intimidating
and totally nonsexual--a professor,a cop.

16:55.710 --> 16:56.940
A giant spider.

16:57.020 --> 16:59.770
Still?It was just a
movie,and you were,like,nine.

16:59.850 --> 17:04.160
Believe me,I've tried toerase that image from
my mind,but it's just stuck in therereally good.

17:04.220 --> 17:06.310
Amazing advice.I'm gonna try that.

17:06.390 --> 17:07.720
You do that.

17:07.849 --> 17:09.339
Hey,can I help you?

17:09.420 --> 17:11.359
I was looking
for--uh,dr.Lawson.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.220
Mr.Bryant.

17:13.329 --> 17:15.329
Sorry to just show uplike this.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.180
No,not at all.Come on in.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.240
Mr. Bryant.How you doing?

17:20.650 --> 17:22.310
Please have a seat.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.400
So...did--did--did
you--

17:29.500 --> 17:34.800
the irony is... that in
college,I was clean and sober.

17:34.850 --> 17:38.930
I watched my own father drinktill he passed
out,and I swore I would never belike that.

17:39.310 --> 17:43.050
And then tucker was bornand diagnosed.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.930
I'm not proud to sayI
didn't handle that very well.

17:46.020 --> 17:47.820
So you startedself-medicating.

17:47.900 --> 17:51.810
Mostly keeping itunder control,occasional
binges,but I always was able to keep itfrom tucker.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.370
And last night?

17:53.450 --> 17:55.220
That was a new low.

17:55.290 --> 17:57.350
I had some pills delivered.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.870
- If I had hurt
tucker-- you did.

18:03.910 --> 18:05.870
You are.

18:06.040 --> 18:11.150
And trying to hideso he won't see
you like you saw your daddoesn't work.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.500
He's 17 now.

18:15.120 --> 18:20.830
I mean,you've only gota couple more years before you
lose the chanceto connect with him,maybe for good.

18:26.790 --> 18:29.230
I need to get clean,hank.

18:29.290 --> 18:31.010
Great.

18:31.120 --> 18:33.330
You ready to start now?

18:53.770 --> 18:55.730
I love the beach.

18:56.060 --> 18:58.780
Can you believeit's only my first time?

18:58.930 --> 19:00.960
It's betterthan in the movies.

19:01.040 --> 19:05.670
Wait,this is--this is your first
time at any beachin your whole life?

19:05.730 --> 19:08.390
I'm a city
girl--krakow.

19:08.450 --> 19:11.850
The closest beachis 700
kilometers from my home.

19:11.920 --> 19:13.420
That's insane.

19:13.470 --> 19:15.310
Well,that's cool.Enjoy my beach.

19:15.980 --> 19:21.740
Actually,if you look,it's famous
for its,uh... double dunes.

19:22.780 --> 19:26.560
Ana,um... What--what
movieshave you been watching?

19:26.610 --> 19:31.130
My girlfriends once wentto the beach at
szczecin and pretendedit was the french riviera.

19:31.210 --> 19:32.540
Well,that's cool.

19:32.730 --> 19:35.290
Uh,I feel likeI should pretend
that I'm somewhere elseright now.

19:35.360 --> 19:36.460
I'm a natural.

19:36.540 --> 19:38.750
Yes,you are.You're a complete natural.

19:38.870 --> 19:42.250
Um,so do you go to schooland
study with,um,professors?

19:42.300 --> 19:45.290
Yes,for my masterin accounting.

19:45.390 --> 19:47.260
Wait a minute.I'm an accountant.

19:47.830 --> 19:50.500
An actual accountant.

19:50.570 --> 19:52.160
Certified,public,and everything.

19:52.230 --> 19:54.200
This is crazy.

19:54.280 --> 19:56.800
Yes,it is.It's--it's
very,very crazy.

19:56.850 --> 19:59.090
We should date togethersome time.

19:59.170 --> 20:02.400
- Okay,look,ana...
- my boyfriendand your girlfriend.

20:03.150 --> 20:04.700
My girlfriend?

20:04.750 --> 20:06.700
The indian womanwho you were with.

20:06.750 --> 20:09.240
- Oh,no,divya?No,she's,uh--
you'll make up.

20:09.290 --> 20:11.300
You're so cute together.

20:11.890 --> 20:16.130
You know,ana,um,you
shouldreally put something on,um,

20:16.200 --> 20:18.800
just because-- it's not that it's
making meuncomfortable and anxious.

20:18.860 --> 20:21.490
It's just that the sunand your
fair skin,it's just making me,

20:21.540 --> 20:24.350
you know,excited-- worried
is the wordI'd use,really.

20:24.430 --> 20:27.860
Um,and you're alsoa police
officer and a giant spider.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.140
Wow,dad,that is really awesome.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.760
Well,hank deserves creditfor
leading me to water.

20:36.840 --> 20:41.810
Hey,I can lead the horse,but I
can't make him drink... or not drink.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.510
You know what I'm saying.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.880
Um,I'm sure we can finda
good facility in the area.

20:45.970 --> 20:48.540
Actually,I'm,uh--I'm
ahead of you on this.

20:48.590 --> 20:50.640
I've danced around this
decisionfor a while.

20:50.710 --> 20:55.330
I've looked at all the options,and
I have found the right fit.

20:56.780 --> 20:58.900
"Ultra rapid detox"?

20:58.960 --> 21:00.700
They do the whole thingunder anesthesia.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.200
The meds they give you
providean accelerated withdrawal.

21:03.230 --> 21:06.160
Six,eight hours laterwhen you
wake up,the worst of it's passed.

21:06.240 --> 21:11.640
Yeah,uh,I'm not seeingtheir accreditation on
this or what hospitalthey're affiliated with.

21:11.680 --> 21:15.610
I spoke to them.They can have
theiranesthesiologist here tomorrow.

21:15.730 --> 21:18.250
We'll do the whole
thingright here at home.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.640
You can be at homethe whole time?

21:19.690 --> 21:21.740
- Yeah.
- Whoa,whoa,whoa,slow down.

21:21.790 --> 21:24.700
You don't want to gounder anesthesia
outside a medical facility.

21:24.790 --> 21:27.670
There aretoo many risk
factors.One guy with an I.V.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.670
Can't handle every contingency.

21:29.700 --> 21:34.260
Which is whyI want you to supervise,act
as my--my general contractor.

21:34.350 --> 21:35.970
Yeah,that soundslike a good idea.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.130
No,it doesn'T.

21:37.170 --> 21:41.940
Look,they--they don't spell out what
they give youto "accelerate withdrawal,"

21:41.990 --> 21:45.880
but intensifying the processof yanking
opiates off receptors could be torture.

21:45.920 --> 21:47.840
Which is whythey knock you out.

21:47.870 --> 21:51.810
So I sensesome disappointment here,hank,that
I won't be awakeand suffering enough.

21:52.300 --> 21:54.330
No. No one wants youto suffer.

21:54.410 --> 21:57.620
Of course not.But this--this
soundslike a shortcut.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.670
Well,shortcuts get
youwhere you want to go.

21:59.710 --> 22:01.330
They can also get you lost.

22:01.370 --> 22:03.810
One long weekendand I
am back in action,okay?

22:03.880 --> 22:05.120
There's no disrupting my life.

22:05.170 --> 22:07.090
You need to disruptyour life.

22:07.140 --> 22:09.830
The allure of a quick fixis what
got you addicted in the first place.

22:11.760 --> 22:15.370
I am not some junkiewho needs
drugs to get through the day.

22:15.430 --> 22:18.120
I am a guywho got in over my
head,and with a little help,

22:18.160 --> 22:23.010
I am getting out...
that is,if you will help.

22:23.890 --> 22:25.540
Hank?

22:28.190 --> 22:31.420
Of course I will,but not this way.

22:31.640 --> 22:33.480
I'll find another route.

22:40.250 --> 22:43.350
Dad's finally willingto do
this,and you're deserting him?

22:43.450 --> 22:44.590
I'm not deserting him,tucker.

22:44.650 --> 22:46.160
I'm trying to save himfrom himself.

22:46.220 --> 22:47.620
Dad does things his own way.

22:47.680 --> 22:51.310
You're turning thisinto some weird
turf war over who has the better plan.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.380
Look,his plan isn't
flawed.It's dangerous.

22:53.430 --> 22:55.490
Yeah,well,now he's gonnaback
out of the whole thing.

22:55.540 --> 22:59.650
Look,I will findan alternative and come back
with an admissionlined up and a bed waiting.

22:59.700 --> 23:00.920
Oh,great.

23:00.960 --> 23:03.650
Thanks,hank,for nothing at all.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.480
Here you go.

23:19.780 --> 23:21.270
Thanks again for seeing me.

23:21.320 --> 23:23.260
Yeah,you sounded upset.

23:24.650 --> 23:27.590
I have somethingto tell
you that might surprise you.

23:27.650 --> 23:29.920
More than you havinga husband?

23:30.340 --> 23:31.890
Okay,tell me.

23:31.970 --> 23:35.910
It's about borisand
his check to the clinic.

23:36.620 --> 23:39.880
I did something...unorthodox.

23:39.920 --> 23:44.200
And it wasn't to curry favor,but I did
know thatI was helping a wealthy guy.

23:44.260 --> 23:46.160
Helping him how?

23:46.230 --> 23:50.770
I discardedhis blood sample... the
one that you wantedto run tests on.

23:50.810 --> 23:52.120
Yeah,I know the one.

23:52.170 --> 23:57.160
It disappeared from the
labbecause I made it disappear.

23:57.590 --> 24:01.740
I'm sorry,isn't ita hospital administrator's
job to make sure things don't disappear?

24:01.780 --> 24:06.390
Boris had privacy concerns,and eventually,the
sample would've beenroutinely discarded anyway.

24:06.430 --> 24:09.480
But your lab didn't havea
record of it being discarded.

24:09.570 --> 24:11.880
Because I didn't record it.

24:13.900 --> 24:15.900
Is boris sick?

24:16.580 --> 24:18.500
I know that you have to
respecthis confidentiality.

24:18.540 --> 24:21.660
Look,I'm not breakingconfidentiality,because
I don't know anything.

24:21.690 --> 24:23.540
It's why I need to domore tests.

24:23.580 --> 24:26.970
But,yes,I'm afraidhe might be sick.

24:27.010 --> 24:29.950
I told myselfthat I
was helping a friend.

24:29.980 --> 24:33.340
Then this check
arrived,and I felt like...

24:34.220 --> 24:36.320
I don't know,like I was being paid off.

24:36.380 --> 24:39.920
But for what?And--and
why did he disappear?

24:40.760 --> 24:42.270
I don't know.

24:44.110 --> 24:45.440
Sorry.

24:47.160 --> 24:48.520
What's up,tucker?

24:48.770 --> 24:50.250
No.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.710
Okay.Yeah.No,I'll--I'll--I'll
be right there.

24:53.230 --> 24:54.240
- I have
to--go.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.190
- We'll talk later.
- Yeah.

24:56.270 --> 24:59.400
He went through with it.When I got
home,some doctor alreadyhad him anesthetized.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.720
And this doctor left?

25:00.780 --> 25:03.600
He seemed really nervous.And
after I called you,he took off.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.050
No pulse.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.390
He's just lying there.

25:26.080 --> 25:27.020
Clear!

25:34.730 --> 25:37.320
Sinus
rhythm--okay,that's good.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.100
What happened?

25:52.610 --> 25:56.030
That anesthesiologist
probablygave him a bad mix of meds.

25:59.070 --> 26:00.610
Hey,wait,no.

26:00.690 --> 26:03.910
If he wakes up in a hospital,he's
justgonna check himself out.

26:04.210 --> 26:05.550
Then there goes his detox.

26:05.610 --> 26:08.280
Yeah,and our relationship.

26:11.340 --> 26:14.310
Okay,I'll stickwith him here,but
only as longas he's stable.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.810
Any abnormalityin his
vital signs,and we call 911.

26:17.870 --> 26:19.440
Okay.

26:24.890 --> 26:27.540
Compazine,flexeril,and
xanax standing by.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.270
Are you changing the I.V.?

26:29.360 --> 26:30.760
No.

26:30.830 --> 26:32.830
We don't knowwhat was
piggybacked.Let it run out.

26:32.890 --> 26:34.000
Titrate clonidine?

26:34.050 --> 26:37.080
Yeah.Stand by with a patch.We
don't want him hypotensive.

26:37.240 --> 26:39.060
It's gonna get
worsebefore it gets better.

27:11.480 --> 27:14.200
marshall!Can you hear me?

27:15.810 --> 27:20.540
Leave me alone.Leave
me alone...Get away!

27:24.210 --> 27:25.640
I'm okay.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.820
I know!I can hear you!Hold on a sec!

27:58.130 --> 27:59.520
Ana.

28:00.450 --> 28:02.630
It's the middle of the night.Are you...?

28:02.750 --> 28:04.110
Okay,okay,okay.

28:04.160 --> 28:07.650
Look,I just want to beyour friend,okay?

28:07.710 --> 28:09.820
No.I need to seethe doctor.

28:09.920 --> 28:11.560
Well,he's not home.Why?What's wrong?

28:13.900 --> 28:15.290
I'm blue!

28:17.290 --> 28:18.800
What?

28:20.320 --> 28:22.600
What do we do?

28:22.940 --> 28:24.240
We call the doctor.

28:28.630 --> 28:31.090
Why are you still here?

28:31.160 --> 28:33.170
There's no graveyard
shiftfor administrators.

28:33.260 --> 28:36.700
I havea budget review
tomorrow,and I am way behind.

28:36.770 --> 28:39.420
Oh,well,I heardabout your clinic donor.

28:39.730 --> 28:41.740
Congratulations.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.410
What's this?

28:48.320 --> 28:50.290
A placemat from chewy'S.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.140
From the night you first gotthe
idea for a clinic,remember?

28:52.180 --> 28:54.900
You started pencilingall the stuff
that it would take to start one.

28:55.570 --> 28:56.490
And you kept it?

28:56.570 --> 28:59.550
Mm-hmm,'cause you saidit would
never happen,and I said it would.

29:00.770 --> 29:02.580
I love being right.

29:02.730 --> 29:06.050
Well,you're not right yet.I
haven't even depositedthe check.

29:06.170 --> 29:09.050
Well,don't wait.In this
economy,gold can turn to rubber.

29:09.110 --> 29:13.310
Yeah,but I think the money may
have comefrom a tainted source.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.940
So?

29:14.990 --> 29:16.580
Welcometo the world,jill.

29:16.620 --> 29:20.430
In my experience,first rule of charity
work,"never stare a funding sourcein the mouth.

29:20.500 --> 29:22.580
" So the endjustifies the means?

29:22.630 --> 29:25.210
If it helps the peoplewho
need it,yeah,I say it does.

29:26.380 --> 29:28.630
It's what we're bothdedicated to,jill.

29:28.940 --> 29:30.830
It's what brought us together.

29:45.960 --> 29:49.560
Evan has a patient--a friend--
who he says needs help.

29:49.660 --> 29:51.250
Evan has a friend?

29:51.320 --> 29:53.150
Well,at this hour,one can only imagine.

29:54.820 --> 29:57.120
Go ahead.Go see what evan
needs.We're fine here.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.740
I think the worst is over.

29:58.830 --> 30:01.240
- Okay,if you're sure.
- I am positive.

30:03.240 --> 30:04.550
Thanks,divya.

30:04.810 --> 30:05.970
Later.

30:12.870 --> 30:14.220
How long has he been out?

30:14.300 --> 30:16.000
Half an hour.

30:18.170 --> 30:23.600
So I'm guessing one doesn'treally go
through all of that from occasional use.

30:24.730 --> 30:26.940
Yeah,probably not.

30:28.780 --> 30:30.910
What do I dowhen he wakes up?

30:31.000 --> 30:32.170
Oh,don't worry.

30:32.240 --> 30:33.500
I'll be here.

30:33.600 --> 30:38.950
No,I mean,we can't pretend
like everything's okay anymore.

30:40.700 --> 30:42.820
How do I face himafter this?

30:43.870 --> 30:48.540
Look,this has been toughon
both of you,but he loves you.

30:48.820 --> 30:51.630
If it weren't for you,he
may never have tried this.

30:51.750 --> 30:54.200
He is trying.

30:54.430 --> 30:56.650
And he's the only
fatheryou'll ever have.

30:57.730 --> 31:03.230
That's worth fighting for... so
don't give up on him... not yet.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.610
She's at 99%.

31:10.670 --> 31:12.090
She is?

31:12.160 --> 31:13.470
What?Is that bad?

31:13.550 --> 31:14.590
Well,no.

31:14.680 --> 31:15.990
I mean,it's good.

31:16.050 --> 31:18.210
But I thoughtshe was cyanotic.

31:18.310 --> 31:19.460
Cya-what?

31:19.540 --> 31:20.720
In need of oxygen.

31:20.780 --> 31:22.390
But her levels are fine.

31:22.430 --> 31:24.470
Have you been aroundany chemicals?

31:24.530 --> 31:28.690
Just men who thinkthe more cologne
they wear,the more handsome they are.

31:29.260 --> 31:30.820
That wouldn't do it.

31:30.870 --> 31:32.160
Have you been anywhere?

31:32.230 --> 31:34.890
You know,done anythingoutside
your norm recently?

31:35.330 --> 31:36.390
The beach!

31:36.450 --> 31:38.400
I took her to the beach.She's
never beento a beach before.

31:38.470 --> 31:39.990
Okay,let me seeyour strap line.

31:40.080 --> 31:42.170
Uh,I didn't wear a top.

31:42.350 --> 31:43.450
Of course not.

31:43.520 --> 31:46.450
No.She wore bottoms.Show
her your bottom.

31:50.590 --> 31:52.550
Are you takingany medications?

31:52.770 --> 31:55.520
Uh,largactil,since I was young.

31:55.620 --> 31:58.150
I've never heard of
it.Let me look online.

31:59.860 --> 32:01.180
What was it prescribed for?

32:01.240 --> 32:03.990
Uh,the doctor saidI was too active.

32:04.110 --> 32:05.810
Hyperactive?

32:06.780 --> 32:09.000
Oh,my gosh,chlorpromazine.

32:09.090 --> 32:10.650
Largactil's the european name.

32:10.710 --> 32:12.450
W- hat does that mean?-
You still take it?

32:12.540 --> 32:13.930
- Shouldn't I?
- Is she allergic?

32:14.050 --> 32:16.140
No,photosensitive.

32:16.220 --> 32:18.460
With this medication,there
can be a side effect.

32:18.560 --> 32:21.330
Overexposure to the
suncan turn you blue.

32:21.430 --> 32:22.920
- Forever?
- No.

32:23.020 --> 32:24.650
Can you stay out of the sun?

32:24.730 --> 32:26.370
Yes,usually I do.

32:26.440 --> 32:28.890
I work at nightsand sleep most days.

32:28.960 --> 32:30.890
Which is why it
neverhappened before,okay?

32:30.930 --> 32:32.530
Your skinshould return to normal.

32:32.590 --> 32:35.460
And hank can get you a
consultto re-evaluate your meds.

32:35.540 --> 32:37.880
Oh,my boyfriendwill be so grateful.

32:38.250 --> 32:39.880
Boyfriend.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.260
Really,evan?

32:41.380 --> 32:43.900
Oh,no,divya,it's
actuallynot like that at all.

32:44.010 --> 32:46.800
We are friends.

33:02.550 --> 33:05.100
No closed doors,remember?

33:05.180 --> 33:06.780
A man can't havea little privacy?

33:06.840 --> 33:10.490
Not yet,not when bathroomsare the
perfect place to stash and use.

33:13.590 --> 33:16.680
- Okay.
- Hank.

33:27.920 --> 33:29.100
Missed that one.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.380
Thank you.

33:30.490 --> 33:32.030
Thank you,hank.

33:33.400 --> 33:35.180
Okay.

33:50.410 --> 33:51.960
We're going hank-less.

33:52.020 --> 33:53.080
- We can'T.
- Oh,yeah.

33:53.150 --> 33:55.140
It's "hankmed.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.820
" Besides,we don't have a quorum.

33:57.910 --> 34:02.050
Um,a quorumtypically denotes a
majority,and that is exactlywhat we have.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.960
So--oh,look,if it
isn'tthe man of the hour!

34:05.120 --> 34:06.350
So close.

34:06.430 --> 34:07.830
Where have you been,young man?

34:07.900 --> 34:09.350
Don't let me sleepfor
more than two hours.

34:09.400 --> 34:12.449
I'm driving marshall bryantto
a rehab in connecticut later.

34:12.560 --> 34:14.170
What,is tuckerwatching him now?

34:14.250 --> 34:17.130
Libby too-- like a pair of
hawks,very precocious hawks.

34:17.210 --> 34:18.770
Please,hank,you can't sleep.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.770
It's staff meeting time.

34:20.850 --> 34:24.190
Evan,staff meetingsmake me want
to go to sleep when I'm not tired.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.110
I
know,but--but--ah,ah!

34:27.550 --> 34:32.070
Oh,by the way,that girl I asked youfor
the advice about,took her to the beach,

34:32.120 --> 34:34.620
and though I was completely just
trying to be friendswith her,

34:34.659 --> 34:38.760
she took her top off,'cause
she's,like,polish,and she turned blue.

34:38.840 --> 34:43.139
Like,literally,her entire body
turned blue like a filthy smurfette.

34:43.260 --> 34:45.820
You went to the beachwith
a naked blue girl?

34:45.909 --> 34:47.929
She turned blueafterwards,actually.

34:47.980 --> 34:50.850
Okay,I'm clearlyhallucinating.Good
night.Good morning.

34:51.010 --> 34:52.449
And good luck.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.969
Don't leave me herealone
with him,please!

34:56.060 --> 34:57.390
All right,divsy,it's you and me.

34:57.440 --> 34:59.740
So let's turn to... hey,ana.

34:59.820 --> 35:01.280
How are you?You're looking better.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.160
Evan,this is my boyfriend,lance.

35:04.280 --> 35:06.900
Hey,I remember youfrom
tangerine.How you doing,man?

35:07.420 --> 35:09.510
All right.That's
apparently not too great.

35:09.670 --> 35:10.610
This is him?

35:10.680 --> 35:12.790
I told you there's
nothingto be jealous of.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.090
Something happened.

35:14.140 --> 35:16.110
Baby,you are bluealmost everywhere.

35:16.170 --> 35:17.840
I know you cheated on me.

35:17.900 --> 35:19.110
Cheat--me
cheated?

35:19.150 --> 35:20.630
No,no,no,no,no.

35:20.780 --> 35:23.260
Uh,no cheating whatsoever,we
are just friends,right?

35:23.310 --> 35:25.510
- Yes.
- I saw you checked outthose women at the bar.

35:25.560 --> 35:27.070
Yeah--but,lance,it's
true.

35:27.130 --> 35:29.850
Besides,he has a
girlfriend--her.

35:31.990 --> 35:33.770
You're his girlfriend.

35:35.010 --> 35:36.390
Yes.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.250
Yes,I am.

35:39.340 --> 35:40.790
You and him?

35:40.930 --> 35:48.070
And I was at the beach,where aside from
somechlorpromazine-induced photosensitivity,nothing happened.

35:48.120 --> 35:49.060
Nothing happened.

35:49.100 --> 35:51.560
You two don't even belongin
the same room together.

35:51.620 --> 35:53.950
So are you gonna tell methe
truth,or do I haveto light you up?

35:54.020 --> 35:55.990
No,no,lance.Don't light
him up.You'll crunch him.

35:56.050 --> 35:57.680
- What's it gonna be?
- Please,not my face,okay?

36:11.860 --> 36:14.570
Women... they're all crazy.

36:14.680 --> 36:16.270
Come on!

36:16.360 --> 36:18.200
Sorry about that.

36:18.280 --> 36:21.650
Maybe when he getsto know you
better,we can all be friends.

36:21.770 --> 36:24.130
- Oh,I would love that.We'd love to be his friend.
- Yeah.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.840
- Czesc.
- Czesc.

36:25.890 --> 36:28.930
- Ana,come on!
- I'm coming,baby.

36:31.470 --> 36:36.950
Well... well,well,well,well,well.

36:37.010 --> 36:39.570
So it looks like I
foundmy female friend.

36:39.840 --> 36:44.660
Admit it--there is no wayyou would've
kissed me if you didn'T...care.

36:45.820 --> 36:49.700
As a medical professional,it's
my jobto keep people healthy.

36:49.780 --> 36:54.370
Okay,so... you're
sayingyou didn't enjoy that?

36:54.900 --> 36:57.450
Not even a little bit?

37:00.760 --> 37:03.580
I don't mix businesswith pleasure.

37:14.610 --> 37:15.780
You're early.

37:15.940 --> 37:19.310
Well,just 'causeI'm a doctor doesn't
mean I haveto keep people waiting.

37:19.540 --> 37:20.750
Is that all you're bringing?

37:20.830 --> 37:22.370
Actually,there's beena change of plan.

37:22.430 --> 37:24.480
This is headed to kenya,not connecticut.

37:24.560 --> 37:25.330
Marshall.

37:25.370 --> 37:27.900
I promised tuckera two-week safari.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.000
I am keeping my word.

37:29.050 --> 37:31.450
The drugs are barelyout of your system.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.730
I'm postponing,not canceling.

37:34.000 --> 37:37.870
Look,if you don't entera structured
rehab,chances areyou're gonna relapse.

37:37.940 --> 37:40.220
How?By scoring oxyfrom a wildebeest?

37:41.090 --> 37:45.790
The serengetiwill be healing
for me,for him,for us.

37:47.120 --> 37:48.810
I'm all packed,ready to go.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.170
Great.I'll call the pilot.

37:50.890 --> 37:52.310
What?

37:52.420 --> 37:54.090
You don't like this,do you?

37:54.200 --> 37:56.400
The safarishould wait,tucker.

37:56.500 --> 38:00.090
His best chanceis to keep up the
momentum and go to rehab today.

38:00.150 --> 38:03.040
Yeah,but dad does thingshis own way.

38:03.110 --> 38:06.320

you said,and you were right.

38:06.400 --> 38:07.970

38:08.060 --> 38:10.390
I'm not--I'm not
readyto give up on him.

38:11.780 --> 38:13.440
You don't have to go.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.180
