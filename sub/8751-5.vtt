WEBVTT

00:10.880 --> 00:14.036
It's a huge curtain of darkness.

00:14.037 --> 00:16.071
I see a shadow man.

00:16.072 --> 00:17.781
He's upset.

00:17.782 --> 00:19.126
I was scared to death.

00:19.127 --> 00:21.777
- Are you afraid to be here alone?
- It's very nerve racking.

00:21.778 --> 00:25.222
He's gonna try to take her.

00:25.223 --> 00:27.793
I want to fix this. I'm desperate.

00:27.794 --> 00:30.031
They attack her.

00:30.032 --> 00:33.812
It can do very physical things.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.070
It's really bad in here.

00:37.071 --> 00:39.873
My name is Amy Allan.

00:39.874 --> 00:42.309
Something is not right.

00:42.310 --> 00:43.444
I see dead people.

00:43.445 --> 00:45.646
This person might have
been a serial killer.

00:45.647 --> 00:47.415
I speak to dead people...

00:47.416 --> 00:49.318
I get those chills.

00:49.319 --> 00:50.653
And they speak to me.

00:50.654 --> 00:53.121
He is darkness. He is evil.

00:53.122 --> 00:56.058
There's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:56.059 --> 00:57.591
I think she broke her neck.

00:57.592 --> 00:59.161
I rely on my partner.

00:59.162 --> 01:03.464
I'm Steve Di Schiavi. I'm a retired
New York City homicide Detective.

01:03.465 --> 01:04.965
Tellin' me the truth?

01:04.967 --> 01:08.069
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:08.070 --> 01:09.704
I think the Devil is down here.

01:09.705 --> 01:11.205
It's my job to reveal them.

01:11.206 --> 01:12.684
Who the hell would do this?

01:12.685 --> 01:14.807
But Steve and I never speak.

01:14.808 --> 01:16.776
We never communicate
during an investigation...

01:16.777 --> 01:18.144
Until the very end.

01:18.145 --> 01:19.511
Who's he looking to kill?

01:19.512 --> 01:21.480
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:21.481 --> 01:23.782
You need to get out of here right now.

01:23.783 --> 01:24.950
Or time to get out.

01:24.951 --> 01:28.551
It was like endless darkness.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074

01:43.433 --> 01:47.317
Amy and I conduct
separate investigations.

01:47.318 --> 01:52.708
I interview living witnesses and uncover
history that's been buried and forgotten...

01:52.709 --> 01:55.550
While Amy talks to the dead.

01:55.551 --> 01:59.814
I'm in Neosho, Missouri. It's
about a half-hour outside of Joplin.

01:59.815 --> 02:02.450
I got a call from a
local cop named Dennis.

02:02.451 --> 02:05.613
Now, I know cops are trained to
deal with stressful situations,

02:05.614 --> 02:07.737
but this guy sounded freaked out.

02:07.738 --> 02:10.324
He says his wife and two
daughters are being attacked by

02:10.324 --> 02:13.534
something they can't see and
they are petrified to be in house.

02:13.535 --> 02:18.875
Hopefully, Amy and I can
get to the bottom of this.

02:30.284 --> 02:35.708
Before Amy arrives, I look
for any leading information.

02:35.709 --> 02:38.275
This house is filled with
generations of photographs

02:38.276 --> 02:40.940
and personal family possessions.

02:40.941 --> 02:46.841
Once they are covered or removed, the
location will be ready for tonight's walk.

03:01.365 --> 03:05.685
There's a lot of activity around here.

03:07.649 --> 03:12.029
There's a lot of dead people outside...

03:12.307 --> 03:16.927
And they're talking
about the neighborhood.

03:21.281 --> 03:23.047
Hmm.

03:23.048 --> 03:27.788
Some guy is just like,
"insanity and death!"

03:40.640 --> 03:43.148
Well, Dennis, you sounded
pretty concerned on the phone

03:43.149 --> 03:45.084
about, you know, what's going on.

03:45.085 --> 03:46.996
Now, who exactly lives here?

03:46.997 --> 03:50.537
My wife and her daughters...

03:50.789 --> 03:54.486
Who moved out two months
ago. We're separating.

03:54.487 --> 03:57.611
I'm really sorry to hear that. Does it
have anything to do with the paranormal?

03:57.612 --> 03:58.904
A lot of it did.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.339
So, give me an idea of
what's going on here.

04:01.340 --> 04:05.420
Shadow figures, footsteps, scratching.

04:05.442 --> 04:07.476
We could talk about this all day.

04:07.477 --> 04:10.250
- I know you're an Air Force vet.
- Yeah.

04:10.251 --> 04:11.707
- You've been to Iraq.
- Yes.

04:11.708 --> 04:13.308
- Okay, you're cop.
- Yes.

04:13.309 --> 04:16.039
It's hard to imagine guys like
us being afraid of anything.

04:16.040 --> 04:20.351
I'm fearful more of this house
than anything on the streets.

04:20.351 --> 04:23.749
And I'm frightened for my family.

04:23.750 --> 04:26.088
What do you know about the house itself?

04:26.089 --> 04:30.484
The main foundation dates
into, like, the 1860s.

04:30.485 --> 04:36.149
And I believe there was probably eight
to 11 owners in the past eight years.

04:36.150 --> 04:41.618
But it's not just this house, there are
several houses in this neighborhood...

04:41.619 --> 04:45.900
That have had numerous
owners because of problems.

04:45.901 --> 04:49.402
All right. That's interesting. Okay. What
are you hoping we can do for you guys?

04:49.403 --> 04:52.215
My wife and I are going
through some problems and we...

04:52.216 --> 04:55.778
We're hoping to actually
fix that so we can stay here,

04:55.779 --> 05:00.609
and live in a loving family without
being frightened for our lives.

05:00.610 --> 05:03.280
Can you show me some spots in the
house where you've seen things?

05:03.281 --> 05:05.861
- Yes.
- Okay.

05:08.833 --> 05:10.649
So, Dennis, why'd you bring me outside?

05:10.650 --> 05:14.736
I was mowing the lawn and saw a woman
out of the corner of my eyes here.

05:14.737 --> 05:16.618
- Okay.
- On the porch.

05:16.619 --> 05:20.134
- Wasn't the girls?
- It wasn't my wife or two girls, it was...

05:20.135 --> 05:23.729
A full-body apparition of a girl.

05:23.730 --> 05:25.592
Okay. Could you describe her?

05:25.593 --> 05:28.853
A very old, dated white dress, maybe...

05:28.854 --> 05:30.795
Late 1800s...

05:30.796 --> 05:32.854
Tall collar.

05:32.855 --> 05:38.755
She was only there for maybe three
seconds, and then she just erased.

05:39.997 --> 05:43.570
Okay. So, I'm, like,
seeing an older woman.

05:43.571 --> 05:46.351
She's in her 40s or 50s.

05:46.352 --> 05:51.692
She likes light-colored
clothing with a lot of lace.

05:51.713 --> 05:53.943
She kind of always, like, cries.

05:53.944 --> 05:55.445
She's always, like, mopey.

05:55.446 --> 05:58.346
You don't know if there's anything
with her that people might pick up on?

05:58.347 --> 06:04.227
I think they might see her,
like a light-colored apparition.

06:05.403 --> 06:07.607
So, have you ever seen
anything else outside?

06:07.608 --> 06:11.423
Yes. I was inside and heard some
commotion come up the stairway.

06:11.424 --> 06:17.324
And saw a black figure looking
directly at me through this window here.

06:18.037 --> 06:20.019
Can you show me what it looked like?

06:20.020 --> 06:25.249
When I was inside, the shadow
person came from this direction.

06:25.250 --> 06:29.360
And all he did was lean way down,
and then, when we made eye contact,

06:29.361 --> 06:31.957
he just leaned in
forward, like, I dare you.

06:31.958 --> 06:37.777
And then just got up after a
second and just walked straight off.

06:37.778 --> 06:39.772
Now, have you ever seen
this shadow figure again?

06:39.773 --> 06:43.396
Two times for sure on
the base of the stairwell,

06:43.397 --> 06:46.515
looking at me when I had
just come in from work.

06:46.516 --> 06:51.207
Another time, once again, two,
three minutes home from work...

06:51.208 --> 06:56.149
Go into the Master Bedroom
and heard a deep breath of...

06:56.150 --> 07:02.050
And I leaned over, and he wasn't three
feet inside the doorway, just there.

07:04.076 --> 07:09.976
I was scared to death of that
one, and I bolted out of the house.

07:12.151 --> 07:14.205
There is a darkness here.

07:14.206 --> 07:16.114
It walks down the street.

07:16.115 --> 07:18.268
It's not a person.

07:18.269 --> 07:22.529
It's like a huge curtain of darkness.

07:24.992 --> 07:27.494
Someone knows...

07:27.495 --> 07:28.764
Someone knows...

07:28.765 --> 07:30.899
They panic.

07:30.900 --> 07:36.000
I don't think they know
it's affecting everyone.

07:42.772 --> 07:47.040
Up here is where some of the scariest
stuff has actually happened to me.

07:47.041 --> 07:48.081
Okay.

07:48.082 --> 07:51.302
I heard a little girl's laughter.

07:51.303 --> 07:54.239
And I spun around just
as quickly as I heard it.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.994
And literally saw a...

07:56.995 --> 08:00.623
Floating black mist
two 1/2, 3 feet maybe?

08:00.624 --> 08:03.243
- Was anybody else at home?
- No.

08:03.244 --> 08:04.972
No TV on or anything like that?

08:04.973 --> 08:07.112
- There was nothing.
- All right, anything else?

08:07.113 --> 08:09.512
We had another instance where...

08:09.513 --> 08:13.273
I walked out of the bathroom
and came about where you were.

08:13.274 --> 08:18.031
And I got struck from behind by this
very curtain rod right in the back.

08:18.032 --> 08:20.149
You know, Dennis, working
with Amy all this time now,

08:20.150 --> 08:22.995
I know that once it gets
physical, it's really not good.

08:22.996 --> 08:24.234
Mm-hmm.

08:24.235 --> 08:25.941
Has anything else like
this ever happened?

08:25.942 --> 08:28.887
One time, when I actually got
out of the shower downstairs,

08:28.888 --> 08:31.393
and I was drying my stomach area off...

08:31.394 --> 08:34.614
I noticed claw marks on
either side of my stomach area.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.323
Did you ever take photos of it?

08:36.323 --> 08:38.929
I didn't, but I showed Aundrea.

08:38.931 --> 08:41.039
Okay. What do you think's
going on in this house?

08:41.039 --> 08:42.448
I wish I knew.

08:42.450 --> 08:45.938
All I know is that I want to...

08:45.939 --> 08:50.166
Make sure that my wife
and my girls are safe here.

08:50.167 --> 08:52.158
- I'm just worried.
- I can see it.

08:52.159 --> 08:54.176
I love them.

08:54.177 --> 08:57.297
I'm worried about it.

08:59.856 --> 09:03.156
Whatever this thing is...

09:03.675 --> 09:05.967
It can open doors.

09:05.968 --> 09:08.179
It can, like...

09:08.180 --> 09:11.540
Do very physical things...

09:13.826 --> 09:17.417
Grab people, move
things, and break things.

09:17.418 --> 09:21.738
And this darkness saturates the whole...

09:21.790 --> 09:23.770
House.

09:48.030 --> 09:50.032
So, Aundrea, I talked to Dennis.

09:50.033 --> 09:51.971
He told me about you guys splitting up.

09:51.972 --> 09:53.678
- Yes.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

09:53.679 --> 09:54.845
Thank you.

09:54.846 --> 09:57.969
He relayed to me that he thought the
stuff that was going on here in the house,

09:57.970 --> 10:00.109
may have contributed to
you guys splitting up.

10:00.110 --> 10:02.244
- You agree with that?
- I think it's possible.

10:02.245 --> 10:04.534
I've been depressed, anxious.

10:04.535 --> 10:08.654
Have you experienced anything paranormal
in this house, anything unusual?

10:08.655 --> 10:13.081
Yeah. I was babysitting a friend's
baby, and something went across my feet,

10:13.082 --> 10:15.296
just like somebody
brushing against your arm.

10:15.297 --> 10:16.958
I thought it was one of the animals.

10:16.959 --> 10:20.829
The dogs were outside, and the
cat was nowhere to be found.

10:20.830 --> 10:22.364
Okay.

10:22.365 --> 10:26.335
So, do you ever go out to investigate,
see where it may be coming from?

10:26.336 --> 10:30.877
I check, make sure all the doors are
locked, check the house inside and out.

10:30.878 --> 10:32.545
Anything else?

10:32.546 --> 10:35.489
The worst is what I see... a shadow man.

10:35.490 --> 10:39.522
I've seen him standing here at
foot of my bed, staring down at me.

10:39.523 --> 10:43.821
I've woken up with him,
and I was petrified.

10:43.822 --> 10:45.998
Did you ever think maybe
somebody was in the house?

10:45.999 --> 10:50.807
I have investigated every time I
see it, and there's never anybody.

10:50.808 --> 10:52.858
Okay. Now, is that the
only place you've seen him?

10:52.859 --> 10:54.858
No. I've seen him upstairs.

10:54.859 --> 10:57.871
He was standing on the
far side of the bunk bed.

10:57.872 --> 11:01.491
Okay. So, now you've got your
little girls you got to worry about.

11:01.492 --> 11:02.686
They're sleeping with me.

11:02.687 --> 11:06.015
They're too afraid to sleep upstairs,
and they don't want to be alone.

11:06.016 --> 11:09.676
I want to know they're safe.

11:12.287 --> 11:15.996
This lady, her thing,
like, I feel like she's...

11:15.997 --> 11:20.377
She is afraid of what's under her bed.

11:21.249 --> 11:25.796
I feel like her foot or her
ankle or something's been touched.

11:25.797 --> 11:30.237
Whatever is was came from under the bed.

11:33.144 --> 11:36.908
She has a lot of notions about...

11:36.909 --> 11:38.754
- Haunting.
- Okay.

11:38.755 --> 11:41.453
You know, so what she's doing,
like, yeah, there's [Bleep]

11:41.454 --> 11:46.140
There is not good stuff
here. But, she's making it...

11:46.141 --> 11:51.781
She's compounding, like,
she's making it worse, I guess.

11:55.509 --> 11:58.422
Now, had you done
anything like a blessing or

11:58.423 --> 12:00.345
anything to try to figure
out what's going on or?

12:00.346 --> 12:03.032
A friend told me to
try using a sage stick.

12:03.033 --> 12:04.100
Okay.

12:04.101 --> 12:08.463
I, after that, had a college
team of ghost hunters come in.

12:08.464 --> 12:12.642
I'm desperate. I'm willing to
try anything to get normalcy.

12:12.643 --> 12:16.259
You know, you're worrying about your
daughters has got to drive you crazy.

12:16.260 --> 12:18.403
It's very overwhelming.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.395
I had a somewhat erratic childhood.

12:21.396 --> 12:23.504
- Mom worked all the time.
- Right.

12:23.505 --> 12:25.317
I was with grandma and grandpa.

12:25.318 --> 12:27.978
Grandpa was the only father I knew.

12:27.979 --> 12:31.919
He died when I was 7, so
it was mom, grandma, and me.

12:31.920 --> 12:37.091
So, I don't want my girls
to have a mixed up life.

12:37.092 --> 12:39.026
You said your grandfather
died when you were 7.

12:39.027 --> 12:40.766
Do you remember much about him?

12:40.767 --> 12:44.967
I remember everything about him. He...

12:46.082 --> 12:49.442
- He was amazing.
- Okay.

12:49.684 --> 12:51.752
Okay. Did he die young?

12:51.753 --> 12:53.274
Yeah, he was only 58.

12:53.275 --> 12:56.611
He died of... well, he died
of complications from chemo.

12:56.612 --> 12:58.365
Okay.

12:58.366 --> 13:00.431
I want to fix this.

13:00.432 --> 13:02.483
I want to fix this for my girls.

13:02.484 --> 13:04.770
Okay. I'm gonna try to help you do that.

13:04.771 --> 13:07.771
- Thank you.
- Okay.

13:11.292 --> 13:16.274
There's also, like, a father
figure that's with her.

13:16.275 --> 13:18.164
A lot.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.816
And he's...

13:19.817 --> 13:22.217
He's upset.

13:22.657 --> 13:27.249
Yeah, he says that there's,
like, sage or incense.

13:27.250 --> 13:31.889
He said that there's no way anybody can
help her, really she needs to help herself.

13:31.890 --> 13:36.822
I told her when she was
younger to not do this.

13:36.823 --> 13:38.619
What did he tell her not to do?

13:38.620 --> 13:42.580
Mmm, be into all this dark stuff.

13:42.649 --> 13:47.381
But I'm trying to tell him the dark
just pretty much goes everywhere.

13:47.382 --> 13:52.065
That's why she has to
deal with this [Bleep]

13:52.066 --> 13:56.041
What is that? There's
something else here.

13:56.042 --> 13:58.160
I don't know who it is.

13:58.161 --> 14:01.535
I didn't get to see him,
but he makes you feel...

14:01.536 --> 14:03.978
You know how people are like,
"I feel like I'm being watched".

14:03.979 --> 14:08.107
But this is like burn holes through
your back, like feel really...

14:08.108 --> 14:10.028
Sick.

14:16.942 --> 14:19.536
So, Danielle, I was
talking to mom and Dennis.

14:19.537 --> 14:22.045
They were telling me about
what's going on in the house.

14:22.046 --> 14:24.398
Mom said you and your sister
are having a tough time.

14:24.399 --> 14:28.863
Yeah, no matter where I am, I always
feel as though somebody's watching me.

14:28.864 --> 14:32.123
Okay. Now, what kind of things are
you experiencing? What are you seeing?

14:32.124 --> 14:35.279
Well, one time, I had a couple friends
over, and, all of a sudden, we see,

14:35.280 --> 14:39.587
like, this lady, like the silhouette
of a lady walk by towards the kitchen.

14:39.588 --> 14:41.797
Okay. Was she thin, heavy?

14:41.798 --> 14:44.102
She was thin, and she
had one of those, like,

14:44.103 --> 14:46.697
thicker dresses on, you
know, that like, go out.

14:46.698 --> 14:48.793
- Okay. Like an old style?
- Yes, Sir.

14:48.794 --> 14:51.759
Have you had any other
experiences besides seeing things?

14:51.760 --> 14:54.211
Well, yes, Sir. The other
night, I was sleeping,

14:54.212 --> 14:56.296
and I woke up to somebody
playing with my hair.

14:56.297 --> 14:59.763
You know, I look around,
and I sit up and look,

14:59.764 --> 15:02.674
and nobody was around me,
no animals or anything.

15:02.675 --> 15:05.572
And that was the first time I had
felt it, and that was just uneasy.

15:05.573 --> 15:07.950
You sure it wasn't the
cat or one of the dogs?

15:07.951 --> 15:11.068
- My dogs were boarding.
- Are you afraid to be here alone?

15:11.069 --> 15:12.747
- Yes, Sir.
- You are.

15:12.748 --> 15:14.585
It's very nerve-racking.

15:14.586 --> 15:17.443
Like, I'm always scared
I'm gonna see something or,

15:17.444 --> 15:19.549
like, it's gonna hurt
me sometime or something.

15:19.550 --> 15:23.690
It hasn't yet. It's just, what if?

15:24.125 --> 15:27.296
Up here, it feels like a woman.

15:27.297 --> 15:31.060
- This is a living person?
- Yes.

15:31.061 --> 15:33.925
I just hear her crying...

15:33.926 --> 15:36.086
Whimpers.

15:39.638 --> 15:42.457
They're being watched maybe.

15:42.458 --> 15:48.049
I don't know. What I see here is this thing
standing at the end of the bed, really big.

15:48.050 --> 15:53.950
I think this is that same guy who
watches, the creeper of the house, I guess.

15:54.331 --> 15:58.891
And I think there is
a closet connection.

15:59.761 --> 16:03.121
Oh, no. That's not good.

16:03.904 --> 16:07.564
This looks like a shadow man.

16:07.971 --> 16:11.381
Shadow people are extremely
rare evil entities.

16:11.382 --> 16:15.710
No one knows where they come from, but
they are capable of harming living people.

16:15.711 --> 16:18.174
I don't know if he's
gonna try to take her,

16:18.175 --> 16:20.545
but that's kind of what
it seems like to me.

16:20.546 --> 16:21.873
Take her where?

16:21.874 --> 16:24.018
Uh, into the closet.

16:24.019 --> 16:25.429
What does that mean?

16:25.430 --> 16:30.230
They typically kill
people, the shadow people.

16:45.095 --> 16:48.753
Dennis said Aundrea's house has had
a lot of owners in the recent past.

16:48.754 --> 16:51.194
So I conducted a search,
in the last 40 years,

16:51.195 --> 16:53.552
there have been 15
different owners of the home.

16:53.553 --> 16:54.873
That's unusual.

16:54.874 --> 16:56.789
None of them wanted to even talk to me.

16:56.790 --> 16:59.869
But Dennis mentioned that the
problem was neighborhood-wide.

16:59.870 --> 17:05.770
So I've managed to track down one of
the former residents to see why she left.

17:13.491 --> 17:16.766
So, you lived on Aundrea
and Dennis' block?

17:16.767 --> 17:18.378
I did, across the street.

17:18.380 --> 17:21.699
So, they're having some
paranormal problems.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.178
Are you surprised by that?

17:24.179 --> 17:25.507
Not really.

17:25.508 --> 17:28.403
- Why is that?
- Um...

17:28.404 --> 17:31.307
The house that Aundrea lives
in was on the market for quite

17:31.308 --> 17:33.773
some time before anybody moved
in, it was vacant for a while.

17:33.774 --> 17:37.466
So, I assumed they'd had
some kind of an issue there.

17:37.467 --> 17:40.323
And I had some unusual
things happen at my house.

17:40.324 --> 17:41.385
Like what?

17:41.386 --> 17:45.292
There was a wall between the
dining room and the living room.

17:45.293 --> 17:48.477
And there was a dark streak,
kind of a reddish-brown color,

17:48.478 --> 17:53.582
that would go from the top of the ceiling
down, almost all the way to the floor.

17:53.583 --> 17:57.033
And it would show up in the living
room and in the dining room side.

17:57.034 --> 18:00.245
And I painted over it,
and I papered over it,

18:00.246 --> 18:02.514
and it would just inevitably
come back every time.

18:02.515 --> 18:05.824
The only way I could get rid of it in the
living room was to put paneling over it.

18:05.825 --> 18:07.874
So, when you painted over
it, it would come through?

18:07.875 --> 18:08.679
Yes.

18:08.680 --> 18:11.561
- You wallpaper over it and...
- It came though.

18:11.562 --> 18:17.022
- Really? Even with the wallpaper?
- Even the wallpaper.

18:18.790 --> 18:23.590
When I started my walk,
I saw this darkness.

18:23.911 --> 18:28.291
This darkness, it walks down the street.

18:29.065 --> 18:32.585
It'll come right in the door.
It'll, like, literally open...

18:32.586 --> 18:36.786
I see doors opening in this darkness.

18:40.086 --> 18:44.035
And there were little
people or something in it.

18:44.036 --> 18:47.882
Like little creature
things or something.

18:47.883 --> 18:51.903
And there's panic because of this.

18:53.093 --> 18:56.812
The darkness consuming this house
is carrying an evil presence with it.

18:56.813 --> 19:00.014
And it's beginning to
reveal itself to me.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.756
Do you know if these different
figures you saw in darkness,

19:02.757 --> 19:05.202
if these are separate entities?

19:05.203 --> 19:06.797
Yes.

19:06.798 --> 19:09.739
They're all, like...

19:09.740 --> 19:12.380
Separate beings.

19:15.303 --> 19:18.742
I need to find everything I
can about my client's property.

19:18.743 --> 19:21.470
So I head to the local library.

19:21.471 --> 19:23.136
Digging through the archives...

19:23.137 --> 19:28.135
I discover a Brothel ran on
Aundrea's land in the late 1800s.

19:28.136 --> 19:32.404
But what really catches my attention is
a fatal shooting that took place there.

19:32.405 --> 19:38.045
Resulting in one man's death
and an historic court case.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.791
I'm on my way to meet
with a local author.

19:41.792 --> 19:47.692
He says the case ended up with one dead
body, several trials, and no convictions.

19:52.103 --> 19:54.203
Doing the research on the
property I'm investigating,

19:54.204 --> 19:58.142
I came across an article that
there had been a murder in 1875.

19:58.143 --> 20:00.369
In a Brothel that was on the property.

20:00.370 --> 20:03.878
Yes, one of the rooms was
leased to Lizzie Sanford,

20:03.879 --> 20:07.511
and she opened a
Brothel there in Neosho.

20:07.512 --> 20:11.952
And on the night of December 23, 1875...

20:12.511 --> 20:15.938
She was entertaining a 17-year-old
young man named Lane Britton.

20:15.939 --> 20:18.228
I have a picture here of him.

20:18.229 --> 20:21.560
She was entertaining him,
Lizzie was, and another young man

20:21.561 --> 20:25.835
named Wiley Huffaker demanded entrance
and started pounding on the door.

20:25.836 --> 20:29.599
And Lane Britton threatened to
shoot him if he didn't leave.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.419
And Wiley said, well,
shoot or be damned!

20:32.420 --> 20:36.175
And Lane took him up on it
and shot through the door and

20:36.176 --> 20:39.264
hit him in the head and
apparently killed him instantly.

20:39.265 --> 20:44.299
Lane Britton was arrested, and
he was tried two or three times.

20:44.300 --> 20:47.456
Finally, on the third time... I think
it was at least the third time...

20:47.457 --> 20:50.145
He was found not guilty
by reason of self-defense.

20:50.146 --> 20:53.680
Because they said that, you
know, their lives were in danger.

20:53.681 --> 20:59.213
So, they acquit him on a justifiable
homicide, shooting a guy through a door?

20:59.214 --> 21:00.979
That's apparently the case.

21:00.980 --> 21:02.163
That's not self-defense.

21:02.164 --> 21:06.575
Not exactly, but that's kind
of what they concluded, though.

21:06.576 --> 21:08.377
Okay. So, he gets away with murder.

21:08.378 --> 21:10.958
Basically, yes.

21:18.387 --> 21:21.457
At one point, I did hear a gunshot.

21:21.458 --> 21:27.358
I heard somebody saying, ha-ha-ha-ha,
that little [Bleep] had it coming to him.

21:32.110 --> 21:34.510
This area...

21:34.714 --> 21:38.074
It has this sadness, a...

21:38.352 --> 21:41.005
Desperate sadness.

21:41.006 --> 21:44.007
And people lose things here.

21:44.008 --> 21:48.088
Like, they lose, like, animals or...

21:48.266 --> 21:51.146
People or children.

21:51.583 --> 21:54.283
They, like, die.

22:07.736 --> 22:09.309
Other than the Brothel shooting,

22:09.310 --> 22:14.279
I haven't found any deaths directly
tied to my client's property...

22:14.280 --> 22:16.847
So I go to the hall of
records to dig up old deeds,

22:16.848 --> 22:19.549
and I come across the
name Emma Mae Liebhart.

22:19.550 --> 22:24.230
Who passed away in
the house back in 1938.

22:25.503 --> 22:27.257
I'm not sure this will help much,

22:27.258 --> 22:33.158
but according to her death certificate,
she died of lung cancer at the age of 65.

22:36.074 --> 22:38.928
I'm seeing the crying woman again.

22:38.929 --> 22:42.245
And she has a horse and a buggy...

22:42.246 --> 22:45.435
That brought her here
when she was young...

22:45.436 --> 22:48.076
Like 15 or 16.

22:49.519 --> 22:52.121
Do you know how she died?

22:52.122 --> 22:57.042
I think it was some kind
of respiratory thing.

23:04.374 --> 23:06.234
Hmm.

23:06.994 --> 23:10.199
I think this is the
woman from outside...

23:10.200 --> 23:14.352
And she spent a lot of time in here.

23:14.353 --> 23:17.513
And she doesn't want to be

23:17.514 --> 23:21.354
bothered by these things anymore.

23:22.126 --> 23:23.397
What things?

23:23.398 --> 23:25.918
This darkness.

23:28.958 --> 23:33.278
I mean, she calls them little monsters.

23:35.472 --> 23:41.372
I think she kind of feels like
they did contribute to her death.

23:42.376 --> 23:45.556
They, like, attack her.

23:49.286 --> 23:52.261
While at the hall of records, I
also found out that the original

23:52.262 --> 23:57.371
owner of my client's property was
the County Sheriff back in the 1860s.

23:57.372 --> 24:00.886
So, I've reached out to the current
Sheriff, and he says Louis Hutchinson,

24:00.887 --> 24:03.314
was once a powerful and wealthy man.

24:03.315 --> 24:09.215
I'm not sure if it's gonna lead
anywhere, but I need to check it out.

24:16.081 --> 24:21.186
We had a Louis B. Hutchinson that was
Sheriff here in Newton County in 1865.

24:21.187 --> 24:22.959
How long was he the Sheriff?

24:22.960 --> 24:26.740
He was here from 1865 to 1870.

24:26.903 --> 24:29.220
And what's he wind up doing after that?

24:29.221 --> 24:32.626
History shows that after he
was Sheriff for five years,

24:32.627 --> 24:36.834
he then dabbled in real estate and
became quite wealthy in the County.

24:36.835 --> 24:40.638
Then, apparently, some of
the investments went bad.

24:40.639 --> 24:42.606
Okay. So, what did he wind up doing?

24:42.607 --> 24:45.042
Then he became just a
farmhand for his brother.

24:45.043 --> 24:46.935
Well, that's kind of sad you know,

24:46.936 --> 24:48.983
went from having all that
money to being a farmhand.

24:48.984 --> 24:50.958
- Yes.
- So, did he remain working on the farm?

24:50.959 --> 24:56.383
No, while he was working as a farmhand, he
had again ran for Sheriff of Newton County.

24:56.384 --> 25:00.222
And was, in fact, re-elected
again and won by 20 votes.

25:00.223 --> 25:03.361
Okay, so, looks like he
got his life back together.

25:03.362 --> 25:06.979
Maybe one other thing I could help
you with the records show that...

25:06.980 --> 25:10.413
He wasn't able to finish his
first term after being re-elected.

25:10.414 --> 25:14.207
- And why's that?
- That he died from paresis.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.920
What is that exactly? Do you know?

25:15.921 --> 25:18.206
It's brought on by syphilis.

25:18.207 --> 25:20.846
It's a very, very painful death.

25:20.847 --> 25:24.015
I know there was a Brothel on
the property I'm investigating.

25:24.016 --> 25:28.521
So, I'm wondering if maybe he
might have got that from there.

25:28.522 --> 25:30.968
And died. Yeah, it's
a sad ending for him.

25:30.969 --> 25:32.889
Okay.

25:38.004 --> 25:42.802
During my walk, I saw a sad woman
haunted by the darkness in this house.

25:42.803 --> 25:45.135
I'm having a sketch artist draw her.

25:45.136 --> 25:48.304
She was very gaunt, very thin.

25:48.305 --> 25:51.770
Brown hair that she had up.

25:51.771 --> 25:55.027
And then she had, like,
very distinct lines...

25:55.028 --> 25:59.228
Running from her mouth down her chin.

25:59.687 --> 26:05.507
Next, I described a terrifying
scene involving a shadow man.

26:06.455 --> 26:10.955
Crawling towards the
bed from the closet.

26:12.061 --> 26:16.501
You could see, like,
muscular definition.

26:16.588 --> 26:19.902
And there's a kid sleeping in the bed.

26:19.903 --> 26:22.363
He's creepy.

26:26.152 --> 26:29.632
Amy, is this what you saw?

26:29.745 --> 26:31.605
Yes.

26:53.766 --> 26:56.478
Now that Amy and I have
finished our investigations,

26:56.479 --> 27:01.380
it's time to reveal our findings to our
clients and each other for the first time.

27:01.381 --> 27:04.604
Amy, I'd like you to
meet Dennis and Aundrea.

27:04.605 --> 27:08.107
When the two of them called us
in, they were living together.

27:08.108 --> 27:12.152
Unfortunately, the activity got
so bad here and so physical...

27:12.153 --> 27:14.346
That it basically drove them apart.

27:14.347 --> 27:16.988
So, Dennis no longer lives here.

27:16.989 --> 27:19.695
But he doesn't think it's safe for
Aundrea and the kids to be here,

27:19.696 --> 27:22.821
and he called for our help.

27:22.822 --> 27:25.539
So, now that Amy's got an idea
of what's going on with you guys,

27:25.540 --> 27:30.277
she's gonna tell us a
little bit about her walk.

27:30.278 --> 27:35.234
When I first pulled up to
the house, I was like, whoa!

27:35.235 --> 27:38.133
It's not just this house.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.836
There's activity everywhere
in this neighborhood.

27:40.837 --> 27:46.737
Like, I heard someone say it
was all insanity and death here.

27:47.612 --> 27:51.210
The house next door, the
older lady that was there...

27:51.211 --> 27:54.733
Had complained of having
spirits in the house.

27:54.734 --> 27:56.075
Really?

27:56.076 --> 27:59.516
I actually spoke to one of their
former neighbors, a woman named Penny.

27:59.517 --> 28:02.814
And it was her opinion that a lot
of the houses here had activity

28:02.815 --> 28:05.999
but people were afraid
to kind of talk about it.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.158
The other thing was,
if you go up the block,

28:08.159 --> 28:10.986
you've got two houses
for rent, two for sale.

28:10.987 --> 28:13.823
The house directly across
the street is empty.

28:13.824 --> 28:17.756
And this house in particular,
I went back 40 years...

28:17.757 --> 28:20.695
And including yourself,
there's been 15 owners here.

28:20.696 --> 28:22.430
Wow! Really?

28:22.431 --> 28:25.266
That's unusual, especially
in a neighborhood.

28:25.267 --> 28:27.187
Yeah.

28:29.534 --> 28:33.387
I was outside, and I saw two men...

28:33.388 --> 28:36.178
And I heard a gunshot.

28:36.179 --> 28:42.079
Then, one of them said, ha-ha, you
know, the little [Bleep] deserved it.

28:43.078 --> 28:45.146
Okay. How many gunshots did you hear?

28:45.147 --> 28:46.880
I only heard one gunshot.

28:46.881 --> 28:48.169
Okay.

28:48.170 --> 28:51.779
That's interesting, because at one
time, your property had a Brothel on it.

28:51.780 --> 28:52.979
Really?

28:52.980 --> 28:55.390
It was run by a woman
named Lizzie Sanford.

28:55.391 --> 29:00.890
And one night, she was entertaining a
young guy by the name of Lane Britton.

29:00.891 --> 29:03.241
The guy on the left.

29:03.242 --> 29:06.197
Another guy by the name of Wiley
Huffaker came up to the door

29:06.198 --> 29:08.497
and was drunk, demanded to get in.

29:08.498 --> 29:11.757
This kid turns around and says, hey,
listen, knock that off, or I'm...

29:11.758 --> 29:14.431
I'm gonna shoot you. Take it easy.

29:14.432 --> 29:18.819
This guy Wiley Huffaker goes, shoot or
be damned, was the statement that he said.

29:18.820 --> 29:19.910
Oh, wow.

29:19.911 --> 29:23.213
And this kid puts one
round through the door.

29:23.214 --> 29:25.343
And catches him in the head
and kills him instantly.

29:25.344 --> 29:27.804
Oh, my gosh.

29:29.146 --> 29:30.750
So, what else?

29:30.751 --> 29:36.325
I got into the house, and
this thick veil of darkness...

29:36.326 --> 29:39.326
Came into the house.

29:39.709 --> 29:45.609
And then, these little three-or four-foot,
like, humanoid things that are pitch-black.

29:46.006 --> 29:49.306
Were within the darkness.

29:50.194 --> 29:54.634
It definitely causes
feelings of despair.

29:54.787 --> 29:57.532
Now, you had mentioned that
you might be a little depressed.

29:57.533 --> 29:59.633
Mm-hmm.

29:59.767 --> 30:03.325
What about their relationship? Could
it affect what was happening with them?

30:03.326 --> 30:05.186
Yes.

30:05.427 --> 30:09.673
With that comes a lot of
loss here in this area.

30:09.674 --> 30:15.574
Like, people are losing, like,
family and friends a lot here.

30:16.300 --> 30:18.965
And these humanoid things...

30:18.966 --> 30:24.066
They can interact with
the living very physically.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.394
I mean, I don't even know
where to start, actually.

30:26.395 --> 30:29.509
You know what? Maybe we'll start
with you getting attacked upstairs.

30:29.510 --> 30:34.970
I was upstairs and got
struck by a large curtain rod.

30:35.569 --> 30:37.435
Whoa.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.438
And it seems to be Dennis
getting the brunt of it.

30:40.439 --> 30:42.705
- Really?
- Mm hmm.

30:42.706 --> 30:45.441
I've been scratched taking a shower.

30:45.442 --> 30:48.844
I'd step, go to dry off,
and it feels like burns.

30:48.845 --> 30:54.745
And I look down, and I had scratches
on either side of my rib cage.

30:55.474 --> 30:58.702
Amy, the thing you should know about
Dennis is that he's an Air Force veteran.

30:58.703 --> 31:03.413
He did three tours in Iraq, he's a cop,
and he's really not afraid of anything.

31:03.414 --> 31:06.053
But I'm scared to be here.

31:06.054 --> 31:07.570
Okay.

31:07.571 --> 31:09.491
Okay.

31:10.244 --> 31:12.098
What else did you see?

31:12.099 --> 31:16.719
I spoke with a female
that I met outside.

31:16.765 --> 31:21.780
She moved here when she
was younger, maybe 15 or 16.

31:21.781 --> 31:24.702
And this was about the 1890s.

31:24.703 --> 31:30.603
When she lived here, one of the
problems that she had was breathing.

31:30.668 --> 31:33.847
And she felt that the darkness,

31:33.848 --> 31:37.012
and the things that are
inside of the darkness.

31:37.013 --> 31:40.313
Contributed to her death.

31:40.534 --> 31:43.676
She's always moaning and crying.

31:43.677 --> 31:49.137
And she was very formally
dressed, with a high collar.

31:52.117 --> 31:57.813
I was mowing the lawn, and I saw
a female very formally dressed.

31:57.814 --> 32:03.161
High collar, very stylish
brown-chocolate hair pulled back...

32:03.162 --> 32:05.060
Just looking at me.

32:05.061 --> 32:07.452
And then she just... woo...

32:07.453 --> 32:09.340
Just disappeared.

32:09.341 --> 32:11.261
Okay.

32:11.280 --> 32:13.610
I didn't even think it
was gonna come into play.

32:13.611 --> 32:17.454
But, during my research, I came across
a woman that lived and died here.

32:17.455 --> 32:19.520
Her name was Emma Mae Liebhart.

32:19.521 --> 32:24.771
She came here in 1895 at the
age 22, you know, a young girl.

32:24.772 --> 32:27.093
She moved into this home in 1908.

32:27.094 --> 32:29.387
Now, you mentioned
respiratory problems, right?

32:29.388 --> 32:30.275
Yes.

32:30.276 --> 32:33.620
She died at the age of 65 in 1938...

32:33.621 --> 32:36.261
Of lung cancer.

32:37.054 --> 32:42.394
There's not photo of her,
but I got her obit here.

32:44.493 --> 32:46.653
Oh, wow.

32:49.009 --> 32:53.269
- You drew her, didn't you?
- I did.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.660
Wow.

33:05.435 --> 33:08.735
The eyes and the hair...

33:09.350 --> 33:12.590
And the dress are good.

33:13.857 --> 33:17.369
She was right there on the porch.

33:17.370 --> 33:21.079
If it was just her, I don't
think I'd be concerned.

33:21.080 --> 33:24.320
But it's not just her.

33:27.142 --> 33:30.293
I went in the Master Bedroom.

33:30.294 --> 33:33.774
And I met a... uh, male...

33:34.246 --> 33:38.520
Who's upset with the woman of the house.

33:38.521 --> 33:41.890
When she was alive, he knew her then.

33:41.891 --> 33:44.245
He said that there's no
way anybody can help her.

33:44.246 --> 33:46.361
She needs to help herself.

33:46.362 --> 33:50.063
I told her when she was
younger to not do this.

33:50.064 --> 33:51.565
What did he tell her not to do?

33:51.566 --> 33:54.741
Be into all this dark stuff.

33:54.742 --> 33:59.059
He seems to be some
type of father figure...

33:59.060 --> 34:02.611
And he feels that his
baby's gone downhill.

34:02.612 --> 34:07.133
But, on the other hand,
he does love this person.

34:07.134 --> 34:10.835
That would make me think it was grandpa.

34:10.835 --> 34:12.755
I was grandpa's little shadow,

34:12.757 --> 34:15.647
and I thought he was the most
amazing thing in the world.

34:15.648 --> 34:17.726
He died when I was 7.

34:17.726 --> 34:20.261
He had had prostate cancer.

34:20.262 --> 34:23.802
His death affected me badly.

34:24.313 --> 34:26.293
Sorry.

34:27.612 --> 34:29.889
Now, you gave me a photo of
him. Is it okay to show her?

34:29.891 --> 34:31.811
Yeah.

34:34.047 --> 34:39.134
Now, you mentioned he was upset about
some kind of practicing dark stuff or...?

34:39.135 --> 34:41.054
Yeah.

34:41.505 --> 34:44.657
I had a ghost hunting team that came in.

34:44.658 --> 34:47.205
Is that the type of thing that
would upset the guy you ran into?

34:47.206 --> 34:49.065
Yes.

34:49.572 --> 34:52.904
I don't know for sure if that
man I saw is her grandfather.

34:52.905 --> 34:56.518
But I do know that relatives often
come back to protect the ones they love,

34:56.518 --> 34:59.166
if they sense they're in danger.

34:59.167 --> 35:01.135
Nothing seems to go right.

35:01.136 --> 35:05.673
One relationship and then another
relationship, and he's left.

35:05.674 --> 35:07.796
So, he could be disappointed in that.

35:07.797 --> 35:09.443
Okay.

35:09.444 --> 35:14.664
Well, this individual is
here because he's worried.

35:14.950 --> 35:17.026
- Okay.
- He is...

35:17.027 --> 35:19.307
Protection.

35:19.511 --> 35:21.789
From what?

35:21.790 --> 35:24.767
Well, in the bedroom downstairs...

35:24.768 --> 35:29.448
I felt someone, like,
intensely watching me.

35:30.323 --> 35:35.183
I glanced back, and I
saw this shadow person.

35:37.553 --> 35:40.913
It is extremely dangerous.

35:41.680 --> 35:44.233
Then, I went into the pink room.

35:44.234 --> 35:46.879
- That's Danielle's room.
- Yeah.

35:46.880 --> 35:52.280
And I saw the shadow man
crawling out of the closet.

35:52.700 --> 35:56.389
Going towards me and towards the bed.

35:56.390 --> 35:58.790
My goodness.

35:59.272 --> 36:03.694
I've seen him at the
foot of my bed downstairs.

36:03.695 --> 36:06.547
I've heard him breathe
all over the house.

36:06.548 --> 36:09.496
I see him all over the place.

36:09.497 --> 36:14.297
One time in the bathroom,
I hear this big...

36:15.120 --> 36:19.996
And I kind of peered over
to the bathroom door...

36:19.997 --> 36:24.377
And he's just right there, solid black.

36:25.411 --> 36:28.051
And I ran out.

36:28.190 --> 36:34.090
Well, I did do a sketch of what I saw
as far as him coming out of the closet.

36:41.573 --> 36:45.893
- That's your daughter's room.
- Yeah.

36:47.974 --> 36:51.094
That picture kills me.

37:07.400 --> 37:13.300
I did do a sketch of what I saw as
far as him coming out of the closet.

37:20.447 --> 37:24.767
- That's your daughter's room.
- Yeah.

37:30.266 --> 37:33.344
That picture kills me.

37:33.345 --> 37:36.027
It's hard for me to hand
that over to you guys.

37:36.028 --> 37:39.268
No wonder she's afraid.

37:41.117 --> 37:43.619
That's disturbing.

37:43.620 --> 37:49.384
I definitely don't want my wife
or my two daughters just being...

37:49.385 --> 37:53.345
Crawled upon and climbed into bed.

37:53.696 --> 37:58.078
It bothers me a great deal.
I love this family, and I...

37:58.079 --> 38:01.963
I don't want anything to harm them.

38:01.964 --> 38:05.766
So, the question is, what
the hell is going on here?

38:05.767 --> 38:10.027
There must be some specific location...

38:10.081 --> 38:11.730
In this neighborhood.

38:11.731 --> 38:14.025
Some type of doorway.

38:14.026 --> 38:18.653
Where the shadow people and little
humanoid creatures I saw are coming from.

38:18.654 --> 38:22.494
These little humanoid creatures...

38:22.501 --> 38:25.024
Or shadow people.

38:25.025 --> 38:30.501
There seems to be kind of,
like, a whole Army of them.

38:30.502 --> 38:36.202
But I believe that he's some
type of ringleader of them.

38:36.473 --> 38:40.556
So, this thing upstairs in Danielle's
room, is that a shadow person?

38:40.557 --> 38:43.110
I believe it is. Yes.

38:43.111 --> 38:45.349
And that's very bad.

38:45.350 --> 38:49.490
Shadow people are extremely dangerous.

38:50.555 --> 38:52.843
What exactly are shadow people?

38:52.844 --> 38:55.321
There's a lot of different theories.

38:55.322 --> 39:00.962
Some people think that they're
some type of alien being.

39:01.843 --> 39:07.743
People are still convinced that
they're some type of demonic entity.

39:07.940 --> 39:13.340
They tend to go after elderly
individuals or children.

39:13.793 --> 39:19.613
Or homes that are suffering
some type of severe dysfunction.

39:21.282 --> 39:24.318
- And these things can kill?
- Yes.

39:24.319 --> 39:26.287
Oh, my gosh.

39:26.288 --> 39:29.023
I mean, is this thing going
after Danielle, or it just his...

39:29.024 --> 39:32.285
It seems to be everybody in the house.

39:32.286 --> 39:34.829
I got to keep my girls safe.

39:34.830 --> 39:37.999
They're everything to me.

39:38.000 --> 39:41.075
Yeah. I'm frightened to death.

39:41.076 --> 39:46.836
We're gonna do whatever we
have to do to keep them safe.

39:49.945 --> 39:52.348
So, it's obviously been a tough night.

39:52.349 --> 39:56.289
And even though you guys always
thought your house was haunted...

39:56.290 --> 39:59.814
You really didn't think it was
this severe or this dangerous.

39:59.815 --> 40:02.252
You got a grave situation here.

40:02.253 --> 40:06.055
But the big question is, is it safe
for you to stay here with the girls,

40:06.056 --> 40:08.363
and maybe get your family back together?

40:08.364 --> 40:14.264
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy
and see if she has an answer for you.

40:16.308 --> 40:20.810
This is the last thing that
I wanted it to be, you know?

40:20.811 --> 40:24.152
I don't want that for...

40:24.153 --> 40:27.453
Many, many, many reasons.

40:28.087 --> 40:32.467
- You can't fight this, can you?
- No.

40:32.663 --> 40:34.764
That's what we needed to know, though.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.033
Yeah. Who's gonna buy the place now?

40:37.034 --> 40:40.094
Another fool like me?

40:41.141 --> 40:43.961
I'm really sorry.

40:44.188 --> 40:47.734
There's a lot of people who think
that shadow people can be dealt with.

40:47.735 --> 40:50.136
I personally...

40:50.137 --> 40:52.177
Don't.

40:54.932 --> 40:58.073
If we move out of here...

40:58.074 --> 41:00.628
- Can this follow us?
- No.

41:00.629 --> 41:05.130
The protector might be the only reason the
girls and I haven't been hurt like he has.

41:05.131 --> 41:07.168
It hasn't been easy.

41:07.169 --> 41:09.265
I know.

41:09.266 --> 41:12.724
Maybe this is something that can bring
youse closer together, fighting...

41:12.725 --> 41:16.446
- For a family.
- For a family.

41:16.447 --> 41:18.685
We'll be all right.

41:18.686 --> 41:21.036
It'll be okay.

41:21.037 --> 41:25.968
Now, if they can afford it, would it
be better if they slept someplace else?

41:25.969 --> 41:29.509
That would be a great idea.

41:30.246 --> 41:33.589
I wouldn't wish this upon anybody.

41:33.590 --> 41:37.293
Maybe start fresh and
get out of here and...

41:37.294 --> 41:39.716
We're gonna get out. We're
gonna get the family out.

41:39.717 --> 41:42.735
- Okay.
- I'm leaving.

41:42.736 --> 41:46.036
I've got to protect us.

41:46.502 --> 41:48.869
I really wish I had another solution,

41:48.870 --> 41:52.415
but I've never heard of shadow
people being removed from anywhere.

41:52.416 --> 41:55.878
And I should know, because they
tormented me in my childhood home,

41:55.879 --> 41:58.007
and I could do nothing about it.

41:58.008 --> 41:59.717
But if I ever figure it out,

41:59.718 --> 42:05.598
I'll be back to help Dennis
and Aundrea cleanse their home.
