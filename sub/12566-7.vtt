23:13.501 --> 23:15.251
No, to me.

23:15.286 --> 23:18.087
Mr. Lawson, I assume you're
here to look into my pants.

23:18.123 --> 23:19.539
I'm...

23:19.541 --> 23:22.425
The pair that were torn on one
of your conference room chairs.

23:22.460 --> 23:24.377
I e-mailed you an invoice.

23:24.412 --> 23:25.761
Is none of this ringing the bell?

23:25.797 --> 23:27.380
No, sorry, I get a lot of e-mail.

23:27.382 --> 23:30.850
Who doesn't? Just search for
"pants invoice." You'll find it.

23:30.885 --> 23:33.886
Will do. So just setting aside
the pants for one second, uh,

23:33.888 --> 23:35.221
I was hoping to talk to you

23:35.223 --> 23:37.306
about a potential high-profile patient.

23:37.358 --> 23:38.558
HPPs are my specialty.

23:38.560 --> 23:39.976
Well, unless you count cardiology

23:40.028 --> 23:41.561
which obviously you do.

23:41.563 --> 23:45.481
I've done Regis, Miley,
Babs. I'm the go-to guy.

23:45.533 --> 23:46.616
Terrific.

23:46.651 --> 23:47.984
[machine beeping]

23:48.036 --> 23:51.037
Aside from the name-dropping, it's terrific.

23:51.072 --> 23:54.657
So this HPP, we're talking
athlete? Actor? Politician?

23:54.709 --> 23:56.125
[machine continues beeping]

23:56.161 --> 23:57.376
You need to deal with that?

23:57.412 --> 23:59.846
I'm on it.

24:02.884 --> 24:04.300
Dr. John, she's tachycardic.

24:04.335 --> 24:07.503
Yeah, she is. Hit her
with 20 mgs of diltiazem.

24:07.555 --> 24:09.639
It's no big deal.

24:09.674 --> 24:11.390
It is a little strange though.

24:11.426 --> 24:14.510
She was doing fine till right
after that basket got here.

24:14.562 --> 24:18.598
They always send fruit.

24:21.769 --> 24:24.153
I gotta go.

24:24.189 --> 24:26.689
Let me know when you want me.

24:26.741 --> 24:28.357
We don't want him.

24:28.409 --> 24:30.910
He may be a good cardiologist
but he's got all the discretion

24:30.945 --> 24:34.197
of Julian Assange on a bender.
You want me to keep looking?

24:34.249 --> 24:36.165
No, the surgical team's only 30 minutes out.

24:36.201 --> 24:37.833
- We should be okay.
- All right.

24:37.869 --> 24:39.619
Come.

24:50.965 --> 24:53.549
His heart rate's dropped. He's bradycardic.

24:53.601 --> 24:57.386
I'm going to administer atropine.

24:57.438 --> 24:59.805
It's okay. It's going to be fine.

24:59.807 --> 25:03.476
Hang in there, buddy. Okay, Poch?

25:03.478 --> 25:05.861
Okay.

25:17.408 --> 25:19.242
He's not responding.

25:19.294 --> 25:20.793
He needs a pacemaker, now.

25:20.828 --> 25:22.245
Can you do that?

25:22.297 --> 25:23.462
(Evan) Yeah, of course he can. He's Hank.

25:23.498 --> 25:26.048
He's done it a million times. Right?

25:26.084 --> 25:28.884
First time for everything, and
unfortunately this can't wait.

25:31.339 --> 25:33.139
[chanting]

25:33.174 --> 25:35.057
Will that distract you?

25:35.093 --> 25:37.977
I'll take all the help I can get,
natural and supernatural.

25:45.201 --> 25:48.542
[upbeat music]

25:50.971 --> 25:53.388
- Nate?
- Hi.

25:53.440 --> 25:57.225
Sorry to bug you again.
I've been feeling a lot worse.

25:57.277 --> 25:59.144
I ache all over and it hurts to breathe.

25:59.146 --> 26:02.731
Okay. Let's see what's going on.

26:04.618 --> 26:07.402
[thermometer beeps]

26:07.454 --> 26:08.953
Odd.

26:08.989 --> 26:10.822
Your preliminary cultures
all came back negative,

26:10.824 --> 26:13.158
but you're still running a fever.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.492
Why is that odd?

26:14.494 --> 26:16.327
Well, usually a high temperature means

26:16.379 --> 26:19.464
that you have an infection of some sort.

26:21.501 --> 26:24.419
Have you taken antibiotics
when this has happened before?

26:24.471 --> 26:25.887
No.

26:25.922 --> 26:30.091
Like I said, it usually
just goes away on its own.

26:30.143 --> 26:33.011
My dad, he used to take cold baths for it.

26:33.063 --> 26:37.015
[accented] "I will drown it out," he'd say.

26:37.067 --> 26:38.316
In a vampire voice?

26:38.351 --> 26:41.886
No, in a Greek accent. He's Greek.

26:43.723 --> 26:45.857
Greek, of course.

26:45.909 --> 26:48.827
Of course what?

26:48.862 --> 26:51.246
Familial Mediterranean fever.

26:51.281 --> 26:52.831
It's an inherited disorder that presents

26:52.866 --> 26:55.333
with recurring fever and inflammation.

26:55.368 --> 26:57.118
That's what this is?

26:57.170 --> 27:01.956
I don't know, but we'll do
a genetic test to find out.

27:02.008 --> 27:04.008
Sit up for me?

27:04.044 --> 27:05.093
Ah.

27:05.128 --> 27:06.928
- Got it?
- Yeah.

27:06.963 --> 27:10.548
Deep breath.

27:10.600 --> 27:12.217
It can also cause fluid
to build up in your lungs

27:12.219 --> 27:14.219
which is the crackling
sound that I am hearing.

27:14.221 --> 27:16.771
I'm taking you to the hospital.

27:22.863 --> 27:24.863
[monk chanting]

27:53.677 --> 27:56.311
Okay. Here we go.

28:04.821 --> 28:06.521
Next time you build a secret operating room,

28:06.573 --> 28:08.690
I'd like to request fluoroscopy.

28:08.742 --> 28:09.858
Because?

28:09.910 --> 28:11.609
Because I'm flying blind here.

28:11.611 --> 28:13.077
The only way I'll know when
the wire's in the right spot

28:13.113 --> 28:16.915
is to watch the EKG.

28:16.950 --> 28:18.616
Hi.

28:18.618 --> 28:21.619
[dove coos]

28:30.213 --> 28:31.880
[monk chants]

28:31.932 --> 28:33.631
Okay. I need to maintain a sterile field

28:33.683 --> 28:37.685
so you need to be my second set of hands.

28:37.721 --> 28:40.104
Hold up that V2 lead

28:40.140 --> 28:42.523
so I can attach this alligator clip to it.

28:48.899 --> 28:50.698
Okay, good. I'm in the right atrium.

28:50.734 --> 28:55.486
[dove coos]

29:08.301 --> 29:12.053
I'm at the apex of the right ventricle.

29:12.088 --> 29:15.556
And...

29:15.592 --> 29:17.642
we have capture.

29:17.677 --> 29:19.761
Now I need you to attach
the leads to the pacer box

29:19.813 --> 29:20.678
which is right there.

29:20.730 --> 29:23.264
If you can grab that.

29:23.316 --> 29:24.349
Good.

29:24.351 --> 29:26.901
All right.

29:26.937 --> 29:29.153
Plug the one marked "distal"
into the negative lead

29:29.189 --> 29:32.774
and the other into the positive,
just like jump-starting a car.

29:32.826 --> 29:34.776
You've never jump-started a car.

29:34.828 --> 29:36.861
Of course I have.

29:36.913 --> 29:39.247
It's just...

29:39.282 --> 29:42.200
been awhile.

29:47.007 --> 29:50.375
[sighs]

29:50.377 --> 29:54.379
[dove coos]

30:08.395 --> 30:12.397
[sighs]

30:26.880 --> 30:29.080
Okay.

30:29.132 --> 30:30.131
Good.

30:30.166 --> 30:32.166
Nice work.

30:32.218 --> 30:36.421
[monk chanting]

30:50.438 --> 30:53.641
The surgeon does not even touch her patient.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.526
(Hank) Yep.

30:55.561 --> 30:58.145
And the robotic arms are so precise,

30:58.197 --> 31:00.814
Rinpoche will barely have a scar.

31:00.816 --> 31:02.399
Used to be for a procedure like this,

31:02.451 --> 31:05.869
you'd have to crack open the entire ribcage.

31:05.905 --> 31:09.039
Will it work, Hank?

31:09.075 --> 31:14.078
It should. It should.

31:14.130 --> 31:15.496
When I was 18,

31:15.498 --> 31:18.132
with far too much money
and not enough sense,

31:18.167 --> 31:22.252
I went off to Tibet in search of a...

31:24.840 --> 31:27.224
searching.

31:27.259 --> 31:30.644
I'd heard of a hidden monastery
that had escaped China's purges.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.347
I was possessed with the romantic idea of...

31:33.382 --> 31:37.985
finding it, and...

31:38.020 --> 31:41.622
And then eventually, I did find it.

31:41.657 --> 31:43.957
But my money had attracted attention.

31:43.993 --> 31:46.226
A month after I left,

31:46.262 --> 31:48.996
the monastery was burned to the ground.

31:51.417 --> 31:54.635
My self-centered escapade was the cause

31:54.670 --> 31:58.005
of their near destruction,

31:58.040 --> 32:02.843
and left me with a profound debt

32:02.878 --> 32:05.295
I thought I'd never be able to repay.

32:09.769 --> 32:12.936
Who knew a robot might be able
to repair a piece of his heart

32:12.972 --> 32:16.557
and a piece of your karma at the same time?

32:19.729 --> 32:22.029
No. Okay. It's... listen.

32:22.064 --> 32:26.700
It's two dark roast, one flat
white, three double caps,

32:26.736 --> 32:28.369
six assorted doughnuts,

32:28.404 --> 32:31.205
and two gluten-free cranberry
almond scones. You got it?

32:31.240 --> 32:32.239
- Got it.
- Okay.

32:32.241 --> 32:34.408
Small black coffee, two sugars.

32:34.460 --> 32:36.076
And that.

32:36.128 --> 32:36.994
Still got it?

32:37.046 --> 32:40.247
Yes. Maybe.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.749
You can do this, okay?

32:41.801 --> 32:45.753
I believe in you, "Philistia."

32:45.755 --> 32:48.338
It's Felicia.

32:48.391 --> 32:50.424
You really didn't have to get me that.

32:50.426 --> 32:52.810
Well, at this rate I'll be
surprised if I get anything.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.845
Oh, so, Margaret, you'll be happy to know

32:54.897 --> 32:57.264
that it is bye bye birdie.

32:57.266 --> 33:00.150
Hamptons Heritage is
once again a no-fly zone.

33:00.186 --> 33:01.819
Somewhere out there, the eagle has landed.

33:01.854 --> 33:02.903
- I got it.
- Right.

33:02.938 --> 33:04.521
Listen, I really want to apologize

33:04.573 --> 33:06.740
for my outburst yesterday.

33:06.776 --> 33:09.660
My bird-hate is not your problem.

33:09.695 --> 33:11.328
Wow. Thank you.

33:11.363 --> 33:13.497
Yeah, it's fine.

33:13.532 --> 33:15.199
Animals affect everyone differently.

33:15.251 --> 33:16.667
I didn't used to hate birds.

33:16.702 --> 33:18.252
Oh, really? What happened?

33:18.287 --> 33:20.454
You park under a pigeon coop or something?

33:20.506 --> 33:22.790
No.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.425
Well, what?

33:24.460 --> 33:26.677
You can't just dangle "I didn't
used to hate birds" out there.

33:26.712 --> 33:28.378
Come on, what happened?

33:28.431 --> 33:31.381
My husband Troy repaired
power lines for the town.

33:31.434 --> 33:32.633
And birds are always landing on those.

33:32.635 --> 33:33.967
That is incredibly annoying.

33:34.019 --> 33:35.636
That's not the story.

33:35.638 --> 33:38.105
Troy had a broken ankle,
and not for the first time.

33:38.140 --> 33:39.606
It was that kind of job.

33:39.642 --> 33:42.359
He was home recuperating,
and I was taking care of him,

33:42.394 --> 33:45.896
and this jay flew into the den.

33:45.948 --> 33:48.315
I chased that damn thing for an hour

33:48.317 --> 33:50.534
until I finally got it out the kitchen door.

33:50.569 --> 33:54.655
When I got back, Troy was gone.

33:54.657 --> 33:57.241
He had an embolism.

34:00.212 --> 34:03.330
Oh, my God.

34:03.382 --> 34:04.548
I'm so sorry.

34:04.583 --> 34:08.302
It was six years ago, but still now,

34:08.337 --> 34:11.338
when I see birds flapping, or cheeping,

34:11.389 --> 34:14.725
or sitting on a wire with their
beady little eyes, I just...

34:14.760 --> 34:18.812
I know it's stupid but
I just can't stand them.

34:24.520 --> 34:26.652
Someone gave me tapioca pudding,

34:26.688 --> 34:29.489
uh, when, uh, when my mom died,

34:29.525 --> 34:31.909
like to make me feel better.

34:31.944 --> 34:35.411
And even still just the sight of that stuff

34:35.447 --> 34:38.532
gives me a knot in my stomach, you know?

34:38.583 --> 34:40.250
Not that I liked it very much to begin with,

34:40.286 --> 34:44.670
but... you know.

34:44.706 --> 34:46.639
I never liked it either.

34:57.269 --> 35:01.138
How is it that you always appear
at exactly the right moment?

35:01.190 --> 35:04.775
Hi, thank you for keeping her last night.

35:04.810 --> 35:05.726
Of course.

35:05.778 --> 35:06.977
How's Nate?

35:07.029 --> 35:10.981
Oh, okay. He should be out by tomorrow.

35:11.033 --> 35:13.400
Are you okay?

35:13.402 --> 35:14.618
I didn't get much sleep.

35:14.653 --> 35:17.070
Did she keep you up? [gasps]

35:17.072 --> 35:18.739
Did you keep Raj up?

35:18.791 --> 35:21.825
It wasn't her.

35:21.877 --> 35:24.077
It was Karen.

35:24.113 --> 35:26.046
Karen.

35:26.081 --> 35:29.082
What do you mean?

35:29.084 --> 35:32.135
When I picked up the twins
yesterday, she wanted to talk.

35:32.171 --> 35:34.922
She said she'd been thinking, and that, uh,

35:34.924 --> 35:38.091
she wants to try couples' therapy.

35:38.143 --> 35:42.596
Something I suggested long ago.

35:42.648 --> 35:44.681
So what did she say?

35:44.733 --> 35:47.568
I said I'd think about it,

35:47.603 --> 35:51.905
which is what I was doing all last night.

35:51.941 --> 35:55.993
And I think I have to
at least give it a try.

35:57.246 --> 36:01.582
For the kids' sake.

36:01.617 --> 36:05.452
The first session is Saturday.

36:05.454 --> 36:06.954
I feel awful.

36:07.006 --> 36:10.624
Don't.

36:10.626 --> 36:13.710
You said it yourself. It's...

36:13.762 --> 36:17.014
You have to give it a try.

36:17.049 --> 36:19.132
I'm so sorry, Divya, but I...

36:19.134 --> 36:22.469
But nothing.

36:22.521 --> 36:25.806
It's the right thing to do.

36:34.033 --> 36:35.732
I'll keep in touch.

36:58.926 --> 37:06.686
[all speaking Tibetan]

37:22.167 --> 37:24.400
What? What did he say?

37:24.436 --> 37:27.220
He says he'd like me to accompany him

37:27.255 --> 37:28.504
back to the monastery,

37:28.506 --> 37:34.393
and he would like to bless you.

37:34.429 --> 37:37.263
Oh. Okay.

37:37.315 --> 37:39.482
[speaks Tibetan]

37:52.697 --> 37:57.033
[speaking Tibetan]

- That's not how you eat corn.
