Can't believe it.
You're a big flower lover, aren't you?

02:18.179 --> 02:20.390
Hey, have you ever grown butterfly lilies?

02:22.600 --> 02:24.227
Oh, they're amazing. Incredible.

02:24.727 --> 02:28.439
Because, see, they-- They're really about
rebirth and transformation.

02:28.898 --> 02:29.774
But here's the thing:

02:30.358 --> 02:32.152
They only bloom year after year

02:32.318 --> 02:34.571
if you're good to them.
Huh? How about that?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.074
It's late, Mr. Delveccio.

02:38.158 --> 02:42.078
Yeah, I know. I know it's late.
I know. It's almost too late, huh, Sally?

02:42.620 --> 02:44.539
I don't have anything to say to you,

02:45.331 --> 02:49.419
except that I would appreciate it if
you would leave this property right now.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.296
You know what?
You were great up there.

02:51.963 --> 02:52.797
On the stand.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.465
Real good. Strong.

02:55.592 --> 02:56.426
Or so I hear.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.389
Okay, come on, let's--
Let's cut to the chase, okay?

03:03.266 --> 03:04.976
Eric is not the killing type.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.853
We both know that. He's not like me.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.354
Or the way I was anyway.

03:09.439 --> 03:10.273
And you know what?

03:10.690 --> 03:14.193
It's okay, because he's done plenty
of shit that he never got busted for.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.111
Okay.

03:16.613 --> 03:20.700
Eric has been walking around life
weighted down by all the shit he's done,

03:20.783 --> 03:22.076
it's finally caught up with him,

03:22.535 --> 03:25.955
and it's about time. But it's gonna
catch up with you too, Sally.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.291
I know you know this, I know you do,

03:28.374 --> 03:29.751
because you're a smart broad.

03:30.835 --> 03:34.505
Thing is, I don't know if you're smart
enough to know you're running out of time.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.344
-I'm calling the police.
-Sally, come on.

03:40.261 --> 03:41.179
Come on, Sally.

03:42.847 --> 03:45.099
You're in danger, okay? Just call him.

03:45.767 --> 03:46.851
-Who?
-Mr. Lopez.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.270
Father Lopez. Call him, will you?

03:50.271 --> 03:52.565
I've seen you and him
in that confessional thing.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.401
Come on, before it's too late,
before you run out of time.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.112
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I'm not leaving

03:58.196 --> 04:00.865
until I know that you heard
what I'm saying.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.701
-I'm listening.
-I know.

04:03.785 --> 04:07.664
But listening is different that hearing,
Sally. Which one did you do?

04:10.833 --> 04:11.834
I heard you.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.214
-I heard you.
-Well, good.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.466
Good, that's all I wanted.

04:19.092 --> 04:19.926
Is that so hard?

04:20.718 --> 04:22.637
Okay? That's all I wanted.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.348
[thunder rumbling]

04:28.309 --> 04:29.769
[Sally] I don't know how to start.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.522
[Lopez] It's very simple.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.568
You say what you have done and through me,
the Lord will forgive you.

04:41.572 --> 04:42.407
That's it?

04:44.409 --> 04:46.202
Anything can be forgiven.

04:49.372 --> 04:50.707
[sighs]

04:56.087 --> 04:57.338
[man] John Rayburn, open up.

04:57.422 --> 04:58.756
[knocking on door]

04:59.424 --> 05:00.800

05:02.802 --> 05:03.845

05:05.513 --> 05:06.389
Come on, Rayburn.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.600
[knocking continues]

05:13.563 --> 05:16.691
You're charged with breaking a promise
to visit during the year.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.986
-What are you doing?
-You don't return my calls.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.864
We figured it was time
for an intervention.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.409
From the looks of things,
not a moment too soon.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.206
-Jeez, it smells in here.
-What the fuck are you doing here?

05:32.290 --> 05:34.375
What are you doing here?
That's more the question.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.878
So anyway, I followed the case.

05:37.503 --> 05:38.755
O'Bannon took a plea.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.090
That's gotta be a kick
in the fucking cojones, huh?

05:41.549 --> 05:44.761
Don't know, thought the department
would've pushed for a max sentence.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.515
-It's a complicated case. Is Vonnie here?
-I bet it was a complicated case.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.850
So, what do you think?

05:50.933 --> 05:53.603
-O'Bannon good for it?
-What the fuck you talking about?

05:53.686 --> 05:57.607
-I don't know. Talk about it over dinner.
-I'm not going to fucking dinner, Mike.

05:57.690 --> 06:01.694
I don't give a fuck that you and Diana
are having some troubles, all right?

06:01.778 --> 06:05.031
It's called a marriage. You--
You put your pants on, act like an adult,

06:05.114 --> 06:07.325
-have dinner with your friends.
-I'm not going to dinner with Diana.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.077
-Yeah, you are.
-No, I'm not.

06:09.160 --> 06:12.455
Did you ever come to visit me? No.
Do I got a problem with that? No.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.624
But if you ever found me
in a place like this,

06:14.707 --> 06:17.543
some lonely as fuck motel,
would you just leave me there?

06:18.461 --> 06:21.839
No, you wouldn't, because that would
be a shitty thing to do to a friend.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.008
Look,
I'm gonna come and pick you up.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.177
Gonna drag you out,
we're gonna have dinner.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.429
And we skipped the 24th,

06:28.513 --> 06:31.682
but let's stay on point. It's our
25th year of friendship, all right?

06:32.266 --> 06:33.935
Clean yourself up. I'll see you tomorrow.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.194
Mike, what the fuck did that mean?

06:43.277 --> 06:44.237
What did what mean?

06:46.531 --> 06:49.575
"O'Bannon, is he good for it?"
What does that mean? He was guilty.

06:50.284 --> 06:51.953
What do I know? I'm retired.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.372
Sure he was, Johnny. Sure he was.

for a mixed-use marina.

one time for the boatyard.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.789
-Yes, I did.
-Now you can help me make it happen.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.501

the project for me.

-Wow. Yes, thank you. Yes.
-Yeah. Yes.

some real estate for yourself and Belle.

to be, like...

could have happened to me.

-Sometimes things need to break,

08:06.277 --> 08:07.737
so you can repair them.

08:08.821 --> 08:12.408
But here's the thing:
Sometimes you also need to take a risk...

08:13.201 --> 08:15.036
in order to achieve your dreams.

08:15.661 --> 08:17.538
Yeah? Yeah, I get that.

I'm involved with them in something big.

in order to finance this project.

08:28.633 --> 08:29.509

08:30.051 --> 08:30.885

08:32.345 --> 08:33.679
there have been some hitches

08:34.222 --> 08:35.097
in the deal.

I need you to help.

I'm finally free of all that shit,
you know?

08:48.152 --> 08:49.362
Well, of course.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.656
You wouldn't have to do anything...

08:51.739 --> 08:55.660
you're uncomfortable about. I mean,
I wouldn't put you in that position.

08:56.911 --> 08:59.372
But this project here...

09:01.040 --> 09:02.667
could be worth millions.

09:04.043 --> 09:06.254
And you'd have
a substantial piece of that.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.800

-I didn't tell you this part. We were...

We were going to Arizona.

And me and my sisters were out
in the front yard,

playing tag
and running through the sprinklers.

11:56.841 --> 12:00.469
And my mom called us in,
and she told us

I'm not gonna leave you.

You're hungry.
Let me get dinner started, okay?

-You lied on the stand.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.087
All right.

14:42.548 --> 14:43.382
[keypad beeps]

14:48.053 --> 14:48.888
[John] You know,

14:49.263 --> 14:51.098
we hate you guys so much...

14:51.181 --> 14:52.182
[Mike laughs]

14:52.266 --> 14:53.767
...that we invite you down here

14:54.351 --> 14:58.522
every 12 months just to make us remember,
"Why is it we hate them so much?"

14:58.606 --> 14:59.440
[all laughing]

15:00.024 --> 15:03.569
And ever since graduation,
which, mind you, has been how far now?

15:03.652 --> 15:05.112
-Twenty-three years.
-What is it, 20?

15:05.195 --> 15:06.280
Twenty-three years.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.406
-God.
-God, we're old.

15:07.489 --> 15:08.741
I can honestly say...

15:09.742 --> 15:11.702
-this is the highlight of our year.
-It is.

15:11.785 --> 15:15.497
-Seriously, we love you guys. We love you.
-I wish you could be closer.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.125
Maybe you can be.
What's your answer?

15:19.168 --> 15:20.294
Well, one of these days.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.381
-One of these days, we may.
-No. This guy's never leaving.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.175
Think he's leaving while Robert's around?

15:26.258 --> 15:28.135
[Mike]
I think Sally captains the ship now.

15:28.844 --> 15:30.971
-A mama's boy?
-[Mike] He's terrified of his mother.

15:31.055 --> 15:33.933
You'd be terrified of her too
if you lived under her thumb.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.809
-[Mike] I am terrified of her.
-[Vonnie] True.

15:36.352 --> 15:37.937
Come work with me for six months.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.397
Worst thing that could happen
is you come back to Camelot.

15:40.481 --> 15:43.275
-Why don't we just start with a visit?
-Done. When?

15:43.359 --> 15:46.987
Well, I'll tell you what. Next year
there's a pier dedication for Mom and Dad.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.447
-[Mike] Oh, fancy.
-[John] How's that?

15:48.530 --> 15:49.657
Think Danny will show?

15:51.909 --> 15:52.785
Oh, I hope not.

15:55.245 --> 15:56.205
Don't you miss...

15:57.247 --> 15:58.791
actual police work?

15:58.916 --> 16:02.044
I know this is gonna sound like blasphemy,
but there's more to life.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.505
-Do tell.
-All right. Here it goes.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.341
Private security business, triple the pay.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.927
If you two left now,
you would not regret it. Trust me.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.347
-[Vonnie] Believe he's right.
-I'll make you a pledge now. Within...

16:13.889 --> 16:14.723
A year.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.475
Within a year,
we'll come visit you.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.227
-There we go.
-[Mike] Want a date, in stone.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.062
-In blood.
-I want a date too.

16:20.145 --> 16:22.398
Telling you, not gonna give you that,
just gonna say, "one year."

16:22.481 --> 16:25.609
All right then. Enough shop talk.
Let's make a toast to tomorrow.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.568
To tomorrows.

16:26.652 --> 16:30.197
And to you guys for having us back
here every single year

16:30.280 --> 16:32.116
and to the first day...

16:32.199 --> 16:33.993
-of lobster season.
-[all] Of lobster season.

16:34.076 --> 16:35.703
-[John] There we go.
-Hear, hear.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.887
-[speaking indistinctly]
-[engine turns off]

17:18.495 --> 17:21.623
[Diana] Okay, honey. We're just
finishing dinner with Mike and Vonnie.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.376
Love you too.
See you in the morning.

17:25.085 --> 17:25.919
Bye.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.296
[upbeat music playing nearby]

17:27.379 --> 17:28.213
[woman] Table's ready.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.632
[Mike]
So how's my one and only goddaughter?

17:31.258 --> 17:34.178
She's good.
She locked herself out tonight.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.179
[Mike] Oh, no.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.264
[woman] Ferris, party of four.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.768
You are a lucky girl.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.396
-"Girl?"
-Oh, jeez.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.066
Twenty-three years, I still
can't get away with anything with you.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.446
You guys seem like you're doing good.

17:53.238 --> 17:54.281
Yeah.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.077
Good decision to move away, huh?

17:59.620 --> 18:02.331
I know I make it sound
like it was my decision,

18:02.539 --> 18:05.834
but, I mean, it was Vonnie.
She pretty much gave me an ultimatum.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.713
She's like, "We're gonna move or
you're gonna find a new wife." So, uh...

18:11.006 --> 18:14.009
But she told me.
She said, "Job's not for you."

18:17.387 --> 18:20.057
You guys are wasting
your lives down here. Especially you.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.226
-Oh, really? Okay.
-Yes.

18:22.309 --> 18:25.145
You know this family's
never gonna let you on the inside.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.606
-They're my family too at this point.
-Oh, come on.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.900
Best thing you can do for John...

18:30.359 --> 18:32.986
is for you guys to get as far away
from here as possible.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.281
[woman speaking indistinctly]

18:40.577 --> 18:41.745
You're a beautiful woman.

18:45.707 --> 18:46.542
Thank you.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.751
Don't mention it.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.133
[Diana laughs]

18:54.216 --> 18:56.510
-What's up with you tonight?
-I don't know.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.012
Every time I see you,

18:59.429 --> 19:01.056
you just look better and better.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.482
-We should get back inside.
-Yeah.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.447
I can't, Mike.

19:32.963 --> 19:36.675
[Vonnie] Wow. We had no clue
you guys were having such troubles.

19:36.758 --> 19:37.885
Yeah. Uh...

19:38.427 --> 19:39.887
-Do you want coffee?
-Sure.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.516
It's been a tough year.
I mean, first Danny then...

19:45.726 --> 19:48.020
Marco and Kevin.

19:48.103 --> 19:51.440
Right.
Right, but you and John will pull through.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.651
I mean, the dark cloud's lifted.
The trial's over, right?

19:56.820 --> 19:58.989
Maybe you guys just need to mix things up,

19:59.072 --> 20:02.242
break out of your patterns.
When's the last time you guys had fun?

20:04.203 --> 20:06.288
[exhales sharply] Can't even remember.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.875
But John's not gonna come.

20:11.835 --> 20:13.086
-Milk?
-Sure.

20:13.670 --> 20:14.838
Mike will work on him.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.550
-He's good at that.
-We'll see.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.102
[line ringing]

20:34.900 --> 20:36.276
[Gilbert] Leave me a message.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.987
[Kevin] Please call me back.
I really need you to call me back.

20:39.071 --> 20:39.988
All right. Bye.

20:41.490 --> 20:44.618
Okay, here's the situation.
I cannot reach Roy,

20:45.118 --> 20:48.622
but I'm telling you, I cannot go
any lower than that. I just can't.

20:48.705 --> 20:49.623
Okay?

20:49.706 --> 20:52.125
-My hands are tied.
-Why don't you cut them off?

20:52.292 --> 20:53.752
-Wow.
-You talk with your mouth.

20:53.835 --> 20:57.130
-Mateo.
-[speaking Spanish]

20:57.214 --> 20:58.799
That means "whore." I know that.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.051
-I fucking know that.
-It is an old joke.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.262
-He is angry like a child.
-Yeah, no shit.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.846
Yeah, but he has a point, Kevin.

21:05.555 --> 21:08.058
-Maybe we should talk to Roy.
-What's the mystery?

21:08.141 --> 21:09.518
You're wasting your time.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.020
You're wasting my time.
You're wasting Roy's time.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.189
If we go any lower,
we don't make a profit.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.732
Why should Roy even bother?

21:16.441 --> 21:18.819
This is twice what we paid last time.

21:18.902 --> 21:21.822
You paid that last time
because we took a total loss last time.

21:21.905 --> 21:24.491
-We did that to show good faith to you.
-Okay, okay.

21:24.574 --> 21:25.409
Listen.

21:26.076 --> 21:29.329
Fuck. Okay, here's what I can offer you.
And this is my final offer.

21:30.872 --> 21:33.083
We'll lock that price in for ten runs.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.669
-That's the best I can do.
-No. Mateo was right.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.880
We came for nothing. Fuck you.
Vámonos, Nicolas.

21:39.881 --> 21:40.966
[speaks Spanish]

21:44.553 --> 21:46.680
You think this is a game, Kevin?

21:49.141 --> 21:50.475
What the fuck does that mean?

21:54.354 --> 21:55.522
[Nicolas] This is my daughter.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.065
Eighteen months.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.067
Corabella.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.489
-[Kevin] She's very cute.
-Mm.

22:04.948 --> 22:06.158
[Kevin] This is my son.

22:08.660 --> 22:10.162
-There's my boy.
-[chuckles]

22:11.121 --> 22:12.164
-Rocky, right?
-Yeah.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.750
We could arrange a marriage.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.044
Sounds good. You pay.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.253
[both laugh]

22:18.795 --> 22:20.756
I'm still not gonna lower my price,
though.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.177
We have a boss too, you know?

22:26.053 --> 22:26.887
Okay.

22:27.846 --> 22:29.681
Who do you think he will blame for this?

22:30.891 --> 22:32.726
Look, Nic, I can--

22:32.809 --> 22:34.978
Forget these two fucking guys. Listen.

22:35.062 --> 22:36.521
I trust you

22:36.605 --> 22:38.190
-and I know you trust me.
-[exhales sharply]

22:38.273 --> 22:39.816
And I'm telling you, straight up,

22:40.233 --> 22:41.818
I'm up against a bottom line here.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.904
There's-- I have no wiggle room here.

22:45.238 --> 22:46.656
Lock the price for 20 runs.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.283
Oh, fuck.

22:48.366 --> 22:50.994
Okay, it's a good deal.
I will sell it to my people.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.830
Your boss will be happy
and my boss is happy.

22:55.248 --> 22:56.541
We provide for our families.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.462
I don't know, man. I just--
I don't know.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.882
It's good, man.
I'll go talk to them. Don't worry.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.261
[chattering in Spanish]

23:09.805 --> 23:10.639
[sighs]

23:14.476 --> 23:16.937
It's gotta be--
It's gotta be in person, okay?

23:17.020 --> 23:19.689
And it's gotta be a public place.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.150
[Gilbert] And why would I wanna do that?

23:23.110 --> 23:23.985
Well, I don't know.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.530
Like, to clear the past.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.407
Make way for the future.
You know.

23:29.491 --> 23:32.077
Hey, look, I don't have anything
against you, sir, okay?

23:32.160 --> 23:33.120
I don't.

23:33.203 --> 23:36.498
You thought you were doing the right
thing last time and you probably were.

23:36.581 --> 23:39.376
-Where are you?
-Well, I have lunch

23:39.459 --> 23:43.004
at the Latin Cafe every day pretty much
about two p.m.

23:43.964 --> 23:44.881
I know it.

23:44.965 --> 23:47.175
-I'll be there tomorrow.
-I'll see you there.

23:50.345 --> 23:51.471
What the hell is that?

23:53.348 --> 23:54.307
[Nolan] Cold cut combo.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.017
A cold cut what?

23:56.893 --> 23:58.311
It's a sandwich. It's--

23:58.395 --> 24:00.355
Dude, that's too much meat.
Look at that.

24:00.438 --> 24:03.525
You got-- You got shit--
You got ham, salami, baloney.

24:05.318 --> 24:06.153
Roast beef.

24:06.736 --> 24:09.072
Christ, it's gonna clog up
your body and your mind.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.324
You gotta stay focused, little brother.

24:11.950 --> 24:12.909
Focus, man.

24:17.706 --> 24:18.748
You see anything today?

24:21.042 --> 24:22.085
Anything for me?

24:24.921 --> 24:26.047
I don't know. Like what?

24:27.007 --> 24:29.301
What the fuck
I should do with my fucking family now?

24:30.927 --> 24:32.429
No. Nothing about you.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.433
But, look, it'll probably come through.

24:37.517 --> 24:40.520
Just gotta give it time.
Look, I don't choose the things I see.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.814
Okay? They choose me and, uh--

24:43.732 --> 24:45.734
If I could make requests
I'd be doing that,

24:45.817 --> 24:47.110
but that's not how it works.

24:49.237 --> 24:50.488
What about me and Sally?

24:51.615 --> 24:53.658
Oh, God. I don't know.

24:53.742 --> 24:54.910
She's been calling me.

24:55.577 --> 24:57.537
-She wants to see me.
-All right, then go.

24:57.621 --> 25:00.832
Go. Go see her. Go, man.
I'm fucking failing here.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.460
I'm failing and I can't fucking--

25:04.044 --> 25:06.296
I can't reach them.
I can't get through to them.

25:06.379 --> 25:08.757
Any of them, I can't-- I just can't.

25:10.842 --> 25:13.345
Maybe you can. I don't know.
You're connected to them.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.149
[gun cocks]

25:27.692 --> 25:28.860
Hey, what are you doing?

25:32.989 --> 25:34.950
-[engine starts]
-Ozzy, what are you doing?

25:35.992 --> 25:37.786
Come on, you should just talk to Sally.

25:41.998 --> 25:43.708
Call that judge we were talking about.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.670
The one-- To give us the warrant.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.422
The one we know. He'll give it to us.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.717
By this afternoon would be good.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.263
Let me call you back.

25:57.138 --> 25:57.973
Come on.

26:00.642 --> 26:02.185
-Hey.
-Sorry about that.

26:02.644 --> 26:03.478
Uh...

26:03.728 --> 26:07.023
I wanted to say thank you for the support
you gave me during the trial.

26:08.483 --> 26:10.568
Sometimes things turn out
the way they should.

26:11.861 --> 26:16.408
-Thought you were taking personal days.
-DeGrasse wanted me to give her a hand.

26:16.950 --> 26:17.784
You need a break.

26:17.867 --> 26:18.702
Hm.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.123
Hey, you know who's in town, don't you?

26:24.708 --> 26:25.542
Who?

26:26.084 --> 26:26.918
Mike Gallagher.

26:28.378 --> 26:29.671
-No shit.
-Yeah.

26:30.213 --> 26:32.090
-How's he doing?
-He's doing great.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.008
He, uh...

26:33.675 --> 26:36.094
You know Mike.
Every day's a fucking party with the guy.

26:40.181 --> 26:42.350
Well, he's a damned good detective,
though.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.352
He was. Yeah.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.314
-Tell him I say hello.
-I will.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.287
[Nolan] Front door was open.

27:03.747 --> 27:04.748
Oh, we don't lock it.

27:05.790 --> 27:06.624
Ever?

27:07.042 --> 27:08.376
Not during business hours.

27:10.128 --> 27:11.713
I wasn't sure you'd come.

27:14.174 --> 27:15.008
Yeah. Why?

27:17.177 --> 27:18.011
Oh, I...

27:18.553 --> 27:22.140
I saw you at the courthouse.
You looked friendly with Chelsea O'Bannon.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.227
Is that a problem?

27:27.771 --> 27:28.605
No.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.317
You're an adult, Nolan.
You can do whatever you want.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.321
-Gee, thanks.
-But you're a Rayburn.

27:36.404 --> 27:37.405
Remember that.

27:39.407 --> 27:40.325
Yeah.

27:44.579 --> 27:46.081
What the fuck does that mean?

27:50.251 --> 27:51.795
What really happened, Sally?

27:55.465 --> 27:56.800
Do you think Eric's innocent?

27:56.883 --> 27:58.176
Doesn't matter what I think.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.553
It's a real tragedy.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.765
I wanna hear it from you.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.684
Hear what from me?

28:07.268 --> 28:08.228
What happened?

28:13.274 --> 28:15.402
For a second,
you looked just like your dad.

28:19.114 --> 28:19.948
[chuckles]

28:21.574 --> 28:23.827
And you both remind me of my grandfather,

28:24.202 --> 28:25.495
that way you smile,

28:26.079 --> 28:28.123
that slow, mischievous smile.

28:30.917 --> 28:31.918
You know how to drive?

28:34.337 --> 28:35.171
Come on.

28:40.552 --> 28:42.137
[Kevin] We kept going back and forth

28:42.220 --> 28:44.222
and I tried to stick
with what we had talked about,

28:44.305 --> 28:48.309
but then I started second-guessing myself.
Maybe I should've held out for more...

28:48.393 --> 28:50.812
You followed your gut, son.
Your instincts.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.355
That's all it is in business.

28:53.064 --> 28:56.067
Anyone can type numbers in a spreadsheet,
but...

28:56.151 --> 28:58.945
-spreadsheets can't tell you who to trust.
-True. [chuckles]

29:01.156 --> 29:03.199
So you're okay with it?

29:03.992 --> 29:04.993
More than okay.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.663
-We'll take it from here.
-Okay.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.457
-I wanna show you something.
-Sure.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.625
-[Gilbert] Take a look at that.
-What is it?

29:13.209 --> 29:15.336
Preliminary site plan for the marina.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.256
-Things move fast here.
-You gotta be shitting me.

29:18.339 --> 29:19.632
I want your input.

29:19.716 --> 29:20.800
Holy shit.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.803
Oh, my God. Roy, this looks incredible.

29:24.888 --> 29:26.055

29:29.100 --> 29:30.268

29:30.351 --> 29:32.645
What's up? Roy. Hey, hey, hey. Shit.

29:32.729 --> 29:34.481
Okay, um-- Oh, fuck.

29:34.564 --> 29:35.440
Um--

29:35.523 --> 29:37.275
Hang in there.
Gonna call an ambulance.

29:37.358 --> 29:38.526
-Okay?
-No hospital.

29:39.110 --> 29:43.198
Oh, shit. I need an ambulance please.
Think my friend is having a heart attack.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.867
It's mile marker 89, Old Highway.

29:45.950 --> 29:48.703
Yes, thank you.
Thank you. Hurry, please. Roy...

29:49.287 --> 29:51.539
It's gonna be okay, buddy.
Hang in there.

29:51.623 --> 29:52.957
Roy? Shit.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.047
Shit.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.509
These are the worst magazines
in the world.

30:04.177 --> 30:05.178
[woman] Thank you so much.

30:06.846 --> 30:09.849
-You heard from your mother?
-Yeah, she's up in Orlando.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.352
Said some dude was gonna record her stuff.

30:12.727 --> 30:15.271
-Oh, that's good.
-Yeah, if you believe her. I don't.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.066
Probably wants to get in bed with her.

30:19.734 --> 30:20.902
[woman] Hi, Mrs. Anderson.

30:24.614 --> 30:27.033
Take a seat. He'll be with you
in just a minute, all right?

30:32.997 --> 30:34.582
So you got cancer or what?

30:34.666 --> 30:35.792
No.

30:36.751 --> 30:37.627
Because...

30:38.086 --> 30:40.505
if this is some kind of
weird-ass sympathy play--

30:40.588 --> 30:43.383
-It isn't.
-I want you to know it's not gonna work.

30:45.093 --> 30:45.927
Okay.

Hi, Mrs. Pearson, this is Kimberly calling
from the doctor's office.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.909
Wanted to leave a message confirming
your appointment next Friday at two p.m.

31:09.993 --> 31:13.538

Tell me how I can help.

[Sally] Father Lopez, I don't--
I don't know how to begin.

31:38.396 --> 31:41.608
You say what you have done,
and through me, the Lord will forgive you.

31:42.692 --> 31:44.569
[tolling continues]

31:45.987 --> 31:47.739
Anything can be forgiven.

31:49.574 --> 31:50.992
I think my family's cursed.

31:51.951 --> 31:53.286
[Lopez] He had two choices:

31:54.829 --> 31:56.080
destroy them

31:56.664 --> 31:57.540
or die for them.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.627
[man] My son.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.713

I'm so glad you're here. I--

32:06.799 --> 32:09.344
Wait, you're not--
You're not Father Lopez.

32:09.427 --> 32:11.220
No, I'm Father Morrison.

32:11.596 --> 32:12.430
Welcome.

32:12.889 --> 32:13.723

32:16.935 --> 32:19.062
I don't know any Father Lopez.

-I mean, is he not working here anymore?

32:23.191 --> 32:24.025
It's just me,

32:24.359 --> 32:27.320
Father Sturgess and Father Barton.
Can one of us help you?

32:29.030 --> 32:29.948
Well, I--

32:30.156 --> 32:31.991
I gotta tell him something. I gotta--

32:36.287 --> 32:37.789
I gotta tell him that I'm sorry.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.208
For what?

32:43.628 --> 32:44.963
I can't. I just can't.

I can't, man. I can't.
I can't get them to hear me, I just can't.

Who's not hearing you?

32:57.684 --> 32:59.060
Doesn't matter. Forget it.

33:01.437 --> 33:04.857
-There's no point anymore.
-I'm sorry there's no Father Lopez.

33:10.613 --> 33:11.447
Hey, Roy.

33:13.157 --> 33:16.828
How you doing? They said I could
only stay in here for a few minutes.

33:16.911 --> 33:18.287
You scared the shit out of me.

33:18.579 --> 33:19.414

-No.

-Too much planning. Too much at stake.

Roy, I can't do that.
I don't know what's going down.

33:41.602 --> 33:42.979
You don't have to.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.440
My guys will take care of everything.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.191
-You just take care of the Cubans.
-Okay.

33:47.275 --> 33:48.609
-They trust you.
-Calm down.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.195
I can't afford for this to go bad.

You're gonna have another heart attack.

34:50.379 --> 34:52.048
I thought you didn't care if I was sick.

34:53.591 --> 34:54.425
I don't.

35:01.557 --> 35:03.643
What would you do if you had money, Nolan?

35:07.480 --> 35:08.564
I'd go to Disney World.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.192
Ride all the rides twice.

35:11.776 --> 35:12.735
I'm serious.

35:14.028 --> 35:16.322
I don't know.
I'd buy a cool car or something.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.909
Let's say it was a lot more than that.

35:23.621 --> 35:26.165
Oh, I'd probably buy a small house. Why?

35:26.624 --> 35:27.542
Good.

35:31.045 --> 35:32.505
Maybe I'd get a dog too.

35:34.048 --> 35:35.133
I'd go to school.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.135
Oh, that sounds like a great idea.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.303
What would you study?

35:39.887 --> 35:40.721
Cooking.

35:40.805 --> 35:41.722
-Maybe.
-Mm.

35:43.891 --> 35:45.518
I liked cooking with my dad.

35:45.977 --> 35:46.811

I have something for you.

I've given Ben and Janey things
over the years.

36:03.744 --> 36:04.745
Want you to have that.

36:07.915 --> 36:08.916
How much is it worth?

36:09.750 --> 36:10.751
Oh, I don't know.

36:13.045 --> 36:14.297
So I could sell it?

36:16.174 --> 36:20.011
-Well, I'd hope that you wouldn't, but--
-This make you feel less guilty?

36:21.470 --> 36:23.639
You could do whatever
you want with it, Nolan.

36:23.723 --> 36:24.724
It's yours.

36:24.807 --> 36:27.310
If you wanna sell it, that's fine.
No strings attached.

Bullshit.
There are always strings in this family.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.912
This is a surprise.

41:38.287 --> 41:40.789
[Lorenz] Well, I had to come down
this way, thought I'd stop by.

41:40.873 --> 41:42.708
Well, come in, Dr. Lorenz.

41:44.960 --> 41:45.794
[chuckles]

41:47.254 --> 41:49.507
You know,
my wife and I, we stayed here once.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.425
Never forgot the place.

41:51.675 --> 41:52.510
Yeah.

41:53.594 --> 41:54.970
Can I get you something to drink?

41:55.888 --> 41:56.764
No, I'm fine.

41:58.224 --> 41:59.099
Can we take a walk?

42:00.059 --> 42:01.685
Sure. Follow me.

42:15.741 --> 42:18.077
You know, I saw our friend today.

42:18.661 --> 42:19.495
He's very sick.

42:20.162 --> 42:20.996
Yeah.

42:22.706 --> 42:25.543
But that's not why I'm here.
I wanted to talk to you.

42:28.504 --> 42:29.338
Okay.

42:30.464 --> 42:31.632
You have a price in mind?

42:34.218 --> 42:35.052
I do.

42:36.053 --> 42:38.514
Well, we should get
the lawyers together, then.

42:45.771 --> 42:46.772
Mr. Delveccio.

42:49.275 --> 42:51.110
No. No, no.

42:51.193 --> 42:54.154
No. No,
this is not what I agreed upon, okay?

42:54.238 --> 42:57.366
I told Mr. Gilbert I wanted to talk
to him face to face. That's--

42:57.449 --> 42:58.617
[man 1] Mr. Gilbert got delayed.

42:58.701 --> 43:01.287
-Easier if you meet him south.
-He changes the time,

43:01.370 --> 43:03.205
-now he changes the place?
-Yeah. Come with us.

43:04.665 --> 43:05.666
Would you go with you?

43:08.586 --> 43:09.628
Okay, come on, come on.

43:09.712 --> 43:12.214
Give me the address
and I'll drive myself over there.

43:12.298 --> 43:14.383
We'll drive and then bring you back here.

43:15.593 --> 43:16.427
Okay.

43:16.969 --> 43:17.845
Yeah, great.

43:17.928 --> 43:19.221
-That works out.
-Okay.

43:19.888 --> 43:22.057
-Can you give me a minute, please?
-[man 1] Not really.

43:22.308 --> 43:24.226
Is the bathroom still busted?

43:24.310 --> 43:25.227
-[man 2] Yeah.
-Still?

43:25.311 --> 43:27.104
We'll stop along the way. Don't worry.

43:28.105 --> 43:29.398
-Thank you.
-[man 1] You're welcome.

43:29.857 --> 43:30.691
[Ozzy] That'll work.

43:31.650 --> 43:32.985
[Lorenz] You know, Roy was, uh...

43:33.652 --> 43:35.529
surprised you were thinking of selling.

43:37.531 --> 43:38.699
Well, it's a--

43:41.535 --> 43:42.453
It's a big decision.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.332
My wife loves this view.

43:48.500 --> 43:49.918
-Yeah.
-And the things you're doing

43:50.002 --> 43:51.045
with landscaping, I mean...

43:53.505 --> 43:55.966
Yeah,
I'm thinking of putting in some, uh...

43:57.468 --> 43:58.719
butterfly lilies.

44:00.763 --> 44:01.639
Before I go.

44:03.891 --> 44:06.685
They come back year after year
if you're good to them.

44:07.186 --> 44:09.188
[♪♪♪]

44:11.607 --> 44:12.983
[Lopez] He had two choices,

44:13.484 --> 44:15.569
destroy them or die for them.

44:17.821 --> 44:20.115
You know,
the parking lot here closes at ten, man.

44:20.199 --> 44:21.033
[man] Yeah. Get in.

44:21.116 --> 44:23.369
-You know, and then there's no loitering.
-Yeah.

44:23.535 --> 44:24.703
Come on.

44:25.829 --> 44:27.206
[car door closes]

44:35.297 --> 44:38.008
Hey, you don't think
they'll tow my car, do you?

44:38.842 --> 44:40.302
[man] No one's gonna tow you.

44:40.928 --> 44:41.762
Okay, good.

44:42.763 --> 44:43.597
Good.

44:45.557 --> 44:47.518
[Lopez] Destroy them or die for them.

44:51.230 --> 44:52.064
[gunshot]

44:57.403 --> 44:59.405
[cell phone chiming]

45:05.494 --> 45:07.121
-Hello?
-[Nicolas] Did you fuck us, Kevin?

45:07.204 --> 45:08.330
Nicolas, is that you?

45:08.997 --> 45:11.375
Did you fuck us?

45:11.458 --> 45:13.293
What are you talking about?
Where are you?

45:13.377 --> 45:14.878
Where the fuck are you, pendejo?

45:15.337 --> 45:16.171
We trust you.

45:16.255 --> 45:18.590
What--?
What the fuck are you talking about?

45:19.007 --> 45:19.842
You tell us.

45:20.342 --> 45:22.594
The plane never made it to Cuba.

45:23.387 --> 45:24.596
They were onto us.

45:24.680 --> 45:25.514
Who?

45:26.056 --> 45:28.142
The feds. They forced the plane down.

45:28.225 --> 45:29.810
-What?
-They nailed Mateo.

45:30.185 --> 45:33.981
Esteban got away.
I'm in Cuba. The shipment is gone.

45:34.064 --> 45:34.940
They knew.

45:35.441 --> 45:37.860
Someone in your organization talked.

45:37.943 --> 45:40.821
No, no, no, man. Listen to me,
it is not my organization. Okay?

45:40.904 --> 45:41.738
You said

45:42.448 --> 45:44.533
you and Roy were partners.

45:44.616 --> 45:46.368
In a fucking boatyard, dude.

45:46.452 --> 45:47.327
Not in this.

45:47.411 --> 45:50.164
You made the deal for the shipment.

45:50.873 --> 45:52.374
You knew everything.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.334
Unless it was Gilbert.

45:54.626 --> 45:56.503
Gilbert didn't have anything
to do with it.

45:56.587 --> 45:57.921
He had a heart attack.

45:58.005 --> 46:00.257
-He's here in a hospital.
-What hospital?

46:00.340 --> 46:02.926
What the fuck, what hospital?
There's only one hospital!

46:03.177 --> 46:04.052
Island Village.

46:04.261 --> 46:06.930
And if I call,
they will tell me Roy Gilbert is there?

46:08.015 --> 46:09.516
And don't lie to me, Kevin.

46:10.142 --> 46:11.393
I know where you live.

46:11.477 --> 46:12.936
I'm not lying. He's right here.

46:14.563 --> 46:17.149
The feds got-- They got Mateo?

46:17.232 --> 46:18.901
-Yes.
-Oh, fuck.

46:18.984 --> 46:20.319
We are so fucked, man.

46:20.402 --> 46:21.987
-Oh, shit.
-Kevin.

46:22.070 --> 46:24.072
-Listen to me.
-Oh, shit.

46:24.156 --> 46:25.866
-He won't talk.
-How do you know that?

46:26.533 --> 46:28.076
You are telling me the truth, no?

46:28.702 --> 46:30.454
Yes, it is the truth.
I swear to God.

46:30.704 --> 46:31.705
I swear to God.

46:32.122 --> 46:32.956
Do nothing.

46:33.957 --> 46:35.501
Don't call attention to yourself.

46:37.211 --> 46:38.128
Go about your day.

46:38.462 --> 46:39.838
And tell Roy what happened.

46:39.922 --> 46:41.465
-I'll be in touch.
-Wait a minute.

46:42.049 --> 46:43.091
How do I know what--?

46:43.884 --> 46:44.927
Fuck.

46:54.353 --> 46:55.229
We're almost there.

46:55.812 --> 46:56.980
He'll give us Gilbert.

46:57.064 --> 46:58.524
Then we'll arrest both of them.

47:01.193 --> 47:02.027
[sighs]

-[chattering]
-[upbeat music playing]

47:12.079 --> 47:15.082
-[Diana] Yeah, she's really sweet.
-[Mike] Well, mission incomplete,

47:15.165 --> 47:16.542
I'm afraid. No John.

47:16.625 --> 47:19.795
-You couldn't find him?
-No. I checked the motel, the inn.

47:19.878 --> 47:20.712
Nothing.

47:21.421 --> 47:22.256
[Diana] Wow.

47:22.339 --> 47:25.884
Twenty years on the job, you couldn't
find a guy that wasn't hiding from you.

47:26.051 --> 47:27.344
-Imagine that.
-Mike.

47:27.427 --> 47:28.262
[Mike] Ah.

47:29.888 --> 47:31.014
He's alive.

47:34.142 --> 47:35.811
[Vonnie] I'm so happy we're all here.

47:35.894 --> 47:38.647
-[Diana] Yeah.
-[Vonnie] Twenty-five years.

47:49.283 --> 47:50.117
Hey, Roy.

47:51.743 --> 47:52.578
Hey, hey.

47:53.579 --> 47:54.413
How you feeling?

47:55.289 --> 47:58.458
-Too mean to die.
-[both chuckling]

47:59.418 --> 48:02.546
And when I go,
they won't be naming any piers after me.

48:02.629 --> 48:04.590
-Probably not.
-[chuckles]

48:05.841 --> 48:06.883
Remember Hearst?

48:08.218 --> 48:09.469
He ran an empire.

48:09.553 --> 48:10.679
When he died,

48:10.804 --> 48:13.140
everybody wanted to know
how much he left behind.

48:13.390 --> 48:15.142
The answer was all of it.

48:20.939 --> 48:22.816
Who you got to take care of you?

48:24.901 --> 48:26.194
Kevin's been here.

48:29.156 --> 48:31.533
I've been thinking a lot
about Robert lately.

48:32.367 --> 48:34.328
He knew exactly what he wanted.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.122
He found you and he built it.

48:37.706 --> 48:38.832
Yeah, he did.

48:40.667 --> 48:42.294
I only knew what I didn't want.

48:44.171 --> 48:45.922
There's nothing wrong with that, Roy.

48:46.590 --> 48:48.133
Everybody changes.

48:49.468 --> 48:50.802
Never changed for me.

48:52.512 --> 48:55.057
I didn't wanna be responsible for anyone.

48:56.058 --> 48:57.100
I didn't want it.

48:58.685 --> 48:59.811
In some ways...

49:01.647 --> 49:03.148
I envy you, Sally.

49:04.316 --> 49:06.443
The only thing you ever cared about...

49:07.903 --> 49:08.987
was your family.

49:10.697 --> 49:11.531
[chuckles]

49:12.407 --> 49:13.283
For you...

49:14.785 --> 49:15.702
it was simple.

49:19.539 --> 49:20.374
Well...

49:21.750 --> 49:23.210
whatever it was, Roy...

49:25.337 --> 49:26.213
it wasn't simple.

49:26.296 --> 49:28.256
[woman speaking indistinctly over PA]

49:33.970 --> 49:35.555
Three of us went out on that boat.

49:36.723 --> 49:39.518
-No, no, no. I don't-- I don't--
-Only two came back.

49:39.601 --> 49:40.686
My fault.

49:41.019 --> 49:43.689
-Robert didn't have anything to do with--
-I know that.

49:43.772 --> 49:46.566
-And you didn't need to do what you did.
-I had no choice.

49:46.650 --> 49:49.528
-You could have turned me in.
-Robert was with you.

49:50.362 --> 49:51.530
Still.

49:51.613 --> 49:53.824
No, we did what we had to do, Roy.

49:54.950 --> 49:57.494
-Yeah, you were wrong.
-Fuck you.

49:58.203 --> 49:59.913
Fuck you.

50:01.039 --> 50:02.874
You've forgotten who you were, Roy.

50:03.834 --> 50:05.502
You've forgotten who you were.

50:08.672 --> 50:10.090
[country music playing]

50:10.173 --> 50:12.342
I just wanted to see Eric take the stand.

50:12.634 --> 50:15.470
I mean, he just looked like
he was gonna kill himself.

50:15.679 --> 50:17.305
Or implode or something.

50:26.648 --> 50:28.275
You guys don't wanna talk about it?

50:32.696 --> 50:34.614
-Let's order something to eat.
-Yeah.

50:34.698 --> 50:36.450
Yeah, I'm not-- I'm not, uh--

50:37.284 --> 50:38.618
I'm not gonna be staying for dinner.

50:43.039 --> 50:44.916
How's your mom? How's she doing?

50:46.710 --> 50:47.544
She's good.

50:49.337 --> 50:50.255
Can I talk to you for a minute?

50:51.923 --> 50:52.758
Yeah.

50:53.675 --> 50:54.801
-Alone.
-[Mike] Yeah.

50:54.885 --> 50:55.761
[John] Excuse me.

51:02.350 --> 51:03.185
What's that about?

51:06.313 --> 51:07.189
Don't know.

51:10.192 --> 51:12.569
[Mike] Okay, wait.
There's something I gotta tell you.

51:12.652 --> 51:15.155
I was hoping
we'd be a little bit more drunk, but--

51:16.031 --> 51:16.907
Could you have a seat, John?

51:19.910 --> 51:22.496
Okay, listen, there--
There's just no excuse.

51:23.121 --> 51:25.415
-What's going on, Mike?
-Okay, I crossed the line.

51:25.499 --> 51:28.460
I did something I shouldn't--
I said-- Well, I definitely said

51:29.127 --> 51:30.504
-something I shouldn't have.
-What?

51:30.587 --> 51:32.589
John, listen to me, okay?
I'm coming clean,

51:33.131 --> 51:36.092
and I'm sorry. I am sorry
from the bottom of my fucking heart,

51:36.176 --> 51:39.179
but the last time we were here,
I kissed Diana.

51:40.013 --> 51:40.847
I know, I know.

51:41.264 --> 51:42.766
That's why we didn't come back,

51:42.849 --> 51:46.394
-that's why I can't face you--
-Fuck you. She told me about that.

51:48.730 --> 51:49.689
You knew about it?

51:52.859 --> 51:55.362
What the fuck
are you doing down here, Mike?

51:57.656 --> 51:58.865
What do you mean?

51:59.991 --> 52:02.077
What the fuck is it
you're not telling me?

52:02.285 --> 52:04.454
-Don't know what you're talking about.
-Aguirre.

52:04.913 --> 52:07.207
-Okay.
-Saw you in the parking lot with Aguirre.

52:07.290 --> 52:09.709
-Okay. You're overreacting.
-Is this about O'Bannon?

52:09.793 --> 52:12.629
What's with you and the case?
Guy's doing 30 years. It's over.

52:12.712 --> 52:16.341
-Why are you fucking asking questions?
-You're acting really paranoid right now.

52:16.424 --> 52:17.968
Then what was in the file, Mike?

52:18.051 --> 52:20.095
-Why did he give you a file?
-What file?

52:20.178 --> 52:22.222
What was in it?
Why are you asking questions?

52:22.305 --> 52:24.099
-I'm not.
-You looking into this case?

52:24.182 --> 52:26.685
-I'm not looking into it.
-Why did Aguirre lie to me

52:26.768 --> 52:29.187
when I said,
"Mike Gallagher. He's in fucking town."

52:29.271 --> 52:31.523
He lies about it.
Why would he do that, Mike?

52:31.606 --> 52:34.693
-Why the fuck did he lie about that?
-Okay. Hold on, hold on, okay?

52:35.735 --> 52:38.822
Okay, just calm down a little bit here.
There is something that I--

52:38.905 --> 52:39.739
I didn't tell you.

52:42.826 --> 52:43.994
You've been turning me down,

52:44.077 --> 52:46.705
like, non-stop.
I got a shit ton of work in Boston,

52:46.788 --> 52:49.040
and I'm looking for a partner,
somebody I can trust.

52:49.124 --> 52:51.751
So I approach Aguirre.
He says, "Sure, I'll consider it."

52:51.835 --> 52:55.005
He gives me his résumé,
his financials, but I tell him, listen,

52:55.088 --> 52:57.424
"Don't tell John
until you've made up your mind."

52:59.718 --> 53:00.552
Now, look...

53:02.095 --> 53:04.723
you're going through something.
I don't know what it is.

53:04.806 --> 53:07.517
