DUDE, WHAT'S A BULWARK?

11:44.829 --> 11:45.997
WHAT?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.082
IT SAYS

11:46.039 --> 11:48.082
"A BULWARK NEVER FAILING."

11:48.124 --> 11:49.876
I THINK IT'S A WALL.

11:49.917 --> 11:53.087
WHY DON'T THEY JUST SAY THAT?

11:49.917 --> 11:53.087
BULWARK SOUNDS TOTALLY GAY.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.174
YOU SHOULDN'T CALL A HYMN "GAY."

11:53.129 --> 11:56.174
IT'S LIKE A SIN OR SOMETHING.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.967
WHATEVER, MAN I'M

11:56.216 --> 11:57.967
NOT SAYING "BULWARK."

WATCH YOU GUYS PLAY TONIGHT?

12:00.053 --> 12:02.180
YOU'RE LIKE A GROUPIE.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.806

12:02.222 --> 12:03.806
SHE'S GOT A DATE.

12:03.848 --> 12:07.686
WHAT?

12:03.848 --> 12:07.686
YOUNG CHUI, THE GUY

12:03.848 --> 12:07.686
MY MOM INTRODUCED ME TO?

12:07.726 --> 12:10.480
SHE ARRANGED FOR HIM TO TAKE ME

12:07.726 --> 12:10.480
TO THE HOCKEY GAME.

12:10.522 --> 12:12.857
IT'S THE FIRST OF THREE.

12:10.522 --> 12:12.857
THE FIRST OF THREE.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.651
THEN HE'S GONNA DUMP HER.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.361
YES. AND I'LL BE CRUSHED,

12:16.403 --> 12:18.655
MAKING MY MOM FEEL GUILTY

12:16.403 --> 12:18.655
ABOUT SETTING ME UP

12:18.697 --> 12:20.532
SHE'LL LET ME

12:18.697 --> 12:20.532
GO OUT WITH DAVE.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.076
I CAME UP WITH THAT.

12:20.574 --> 12:23.076
DAVE HAS A NATURAL GIFT.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.952
WOW. A COMPLIMENT

12:23.117 --> 12:24.952
FROM THE MASTER.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.162
THANKS.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.042
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT OF IT,

12:28.540 --> 12:31.042
I LET HIM TAKE CREDIT.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.627
MEN SOMETIMES NEED THAT.

12:32.669 --> 12:35.129
I'M TELLING YOU, DUDE,

12:32.669 --> 12:35.129
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!

12:35.171 --> 12:37.215
STOP YELLING AT ME.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.215
I DIDN'T WRITE IT.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.384
WHOA. WHOA.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.384
UH, WHAT'S WRONG?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.760
THIS STUPID SONG, MAN.

12:41.802 --> 12:45.139
"FOR STILL OUR ANCIENT FOE

12:41.802 --> 12:45.139
DOTH SEEK TO WORK US WOE."

12:45.181 --> 12:48.226
WHO TALKS LIKE THAT, THE POPE?

12:45.181 --> 12:48.226
ANY OF THOSE LEMON POPPY SEED?

12:48.268 --> 12:49.603
CAN'T YOU JUST

12:48.268 --> 12:49.603
UPDATE IT?

12:49.644 --> 12:51.896
SURE. TELL ME

12:49.644 --> 12:51.896
WHAT THE HELL IT MEANS.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.941
IT'S IN LATIN OR SOMETHING.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.941
I THOUGHT THERE'D

12:51.938 --> 12:54.941
BE COFFEE, TOO.

12:54.982 --> 12:58.069
DUDE, CAN YOU CHILL OUT

12:54.982 --> 12:58.069

12:58.111 --> 13:00.614
TILL THIS SONG'S

12:58.111 --> 13:00.614

12:58.111 --> 13:00.614
I'M HYPOGLYCEMIC.

13:00.655 --> 13:03.617
IF I DON'T EAT SOMETHING,

13:00.655 --> 13:03.617
I'LL CRASH.

13:00.655 --> 13:03.617
IS "ABI-DETH" A WORD?

13:03.658 --> 13:06.994
HOW WILL YOU MAKE YOUNG CHUI

13:03.658 --> 13:06.994
DUMP YOU, BE A REALLY BAD DATE?

13:07.036 --> 13:08.455
WE'VE ALREADY

13:07.036 --> 13:08.455
TALKED TO HIM.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.248
HE'S TOTALLY ON BOARD.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.248
REALLY?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.166
HE LOVES THIS

13:10.290 --> 13:12.166
JAPANESE GIRL NAMED KAREN

13:12.208 --> 13:14.919
WHO HIS PARENTS DON'T APPROVE

13:12.208 --> 13:14.919
OF, HE SEES HER SECRETLY

13:14.961 --> 13:17.213
WHILE HIS PARENTS SET

13:14.961 --> 13:17.213
HIM UP WITH KOREAN GIRLS.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.923
HE'S THE MALE ME.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.923
GOTCHA

13:18.965 --> 13:21.468

13:46.743 --> 13:49.663
GET SEPARATED FROM THE GROUP,

13:49.704 --> 13:53.667
YOU'LL FIND A MAP ON THE THIRD

13:49.704 --> 13:53.667
PAGE OF YOUR WELCOME PACKET.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.710
WHY DID YOU

13:53.708 --> 13:55.710
DRAW YOUR STORE SO BIG?

13:55.752 --> 13:58.129
MAKES IT EASIER TO

IT'S BIGGER THAN

YOU ARE IN ROOM 12,

14:03.510 --> 14:06.680

14:06.721 --> 14:08.515
YOU'RE FROM FRANCE?

14:08.556 --> 14:11.309
EXCUSE ME?

14:08.556 --> 14:11.309

14:11.351 --> 14:13.728
YES. SO, AS I WAS SAYING --

14:13.770 --> 14:16.063
I WAS IN FRANCE

14:13.770 --> 14:16.063
DURING THE BIG ONE.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.316
OH, THAT'S NICE. SO --

14:18.358 --> 14:21.695
NICE?! IT WAS A WAR.

14:18.358 --> 14:21.695
WHAT'S NICE ABOUT THAT?

14:21.736 --> 14:23.446
OF COURSE.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.446
SO, YOUR FATHER --

14:23.488 --> 14:26.073
DON'T GIVE ME THAT ATTITUDE,

14:23.488 --> 14:26.073
FRENCHY.

14:26.115 --> 14:29.369
YOU'D BE SPEAKING GERMAN NOW

14:26.115 --> 14:29.369
IF IT WASN'T FOR ME.

14:31.830 --> 14:35.625
SEE THAT THE VANS ARE BACK AT

14:31.830 --> 14:35.625
3:45 TO TAKE 'EM TO THE GAME.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.918
LORELAI, JUST A SECOND.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.918
I WANTED TO --

14:37.960 --> 14:40.213

14:37.960 --> 14:40.213
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT'S THIS?

14:40.254 --> 14:42.173
THAT'S THE ITINERARY

14:40.254 --> 14:42.173
I WORKED OUT.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.842
I THOUGHT LORELAI

14:42.215 --> 14:43.842
COULD POST IT

14:43.883 --> 14:47.136
IN CASE SOME OF THE INN'S

14:43.883 --> 14:47.136
OTHER GUESTS WANTED TO JOIN US.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.971

14:56.062 --> 14:59.649

15:05.112 --> 15:06.447
YOU'RE LATE,

15:05.112 --> 15:06.447
YOU'RE WALKING.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.244
GO BACK TO YOUR STORE

15:08.241 --> 15:11.244
AND COUNT PEACHES OR SOMETHING.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.328
I'M TAKING A NAP.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.418

15:20.795 --> 15:22.380
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.465
WELL, I WAS THINKING ABOUT

15:24.507 --> 15:26.885
POSSIBLY HAVING

15:24.507 --> 15:26.885
OUR NEXT DAR LUNCHEON HERE.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.553
REALLY?

15:26.926 --> 15:28.553
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.097
I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY

15:28.595 --> 15:31.097
AND MAKE SURE THE PLACE

15:31.138 --> 15:34.267
IS AS CHARMING

15:31.138 --> 15:34.267
AS I REMEMBER. IT IS.

15:34.308 --> 15:37.478
OKAY, WELL, WHAT DAY WOULD YOU

15:34.308 --> 15:37.478
LIKE TO HAVE THE MEETING?

15:47.154 --> 15:49.866
OKAY.

15:49.908 --> 15:52.786
SO...

15:52.827 --> 15:53.870
HOW IS MICHEL?

15:53.912 --> 15:55.162
MICHEL'S FINE.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.997
WELL, GOOD.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.997
I'M GLAD TO HEAR IT.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.041
WELL, I'M GLAD TO TELL IT.

15:59.083 --> 16:02.295
MOM, I HAVE THIS REALLY BIG

15:59.083 --> 16:02.295
FAMILY-REUNION PARTY

16:02.336 --> 16:04.672
THAT INVADED THE PLACE,

16:02.336 --> 16:04.672
I SHOULD PROBABLY GET BACK.

16:04.714 --> 16:08.301
YES, YOU GO RIGHT AHEAD.

16:04.714 --> 16:08.301
DO NOT LET ME KEEP YOU.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.764
MOM?

16:12.806 --> 16:15.266
I'M NOT ALLOWED

16:12.806 --> 16:15.266
TO GO HOME.

16:12.806 --> 16:15.266
WHAT?

16:15.308 --> 16:17.310
SHE'S BANISHED ME

16:15.308 --> 16:17.310
FROM MY OWN HOUSE.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.520
GRAN?

16:17.351 --> 16:19.520
SHE'S GONE MAD.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.397
THIS MORNING SHE ANNOUNCES

16:19.562 --> 16:21.397
THAT SHE'S HOSTING

16:21.439 --> 16:23.900
A MEETING OF HER

16:21.439 --> 16:23.900
BITTER OLD BIDDIES CLUB TONIGHT,

16:23.942 --> 16:25.819
SHE NEEDS

16:23.942 --> 16:25.819
THE ENTIRE DAY TO PREPARE

16:25.860 --> 16:28.362
BECAUSE THE HOUSE

16:25.860 --> 16:28.362
IS IN SHAMBLES.

16:25.860 --> 16:28.362
NICE. SUBTLE.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.197
I WAS HANDED

16:28.404 --> 16:30.197
A LIST OF CHORES

16:30.239 --> 16:33.451
AND ASKED NOT TO COME HOME

16:30.239 --> 16:33.451
UNTIL AT LEAST 6:00.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.912
SHE'S ONLY STAYING

16:33.493 --> 16:35.912
WITH YOU FOR A FEW DAYS.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.706
I GOTTA BUY FLOWERS. SHE DOESN'T

16:35.954 --> 16:38.706
LIKE MINE. THEY'RE TOO TALL.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.792
"IT'S OSTENTATIOUS TO HAVE

16:38.748 --> 16:40.792
FLOWERS THAT TALL."

16:40.834 --> 16:42.502
I'VE BEEN MEANING

16:40.834 --> 16:42.502
TO MENTION THAT.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.128
I GOTTA GET

16:42.543 --> 16:44.128
NEW GUEST TOWELS,

16:44.170 --> 16:47.131
NEW HIGHBALL GLASSES. FOUR VERY

16:44.170 --> 16:47.131
SPECIFIC TYPES OF CHEESE,

16:47.173 --> 16:49.175
AND I HAVE TO FIND

16:47.173 --> 16:49.175
A SLIDE PROJECTOR

16:49.216 --> 16:50.635
BECAUSE THEY'RE

16:49.216 --> 16:50.635
GONNA VIEW SLIDES

16:50.677 --> 16:53.262
OF POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS

16:50.677 --> 16:53.262
FOR THE MUSEUM.

16:53.304 --> 16:56.557
OKAY. MOM.

16:53.304 --> 16:56.557
I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE

16:53.304 --> 16:56.557
TO FIND THE PROJECTOR.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.559
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING INSANE.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.559
MOM.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.102
I'M SORRY.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.856
I THINK I'M JUST

17:00.144 --> 17:02.856
A LITTLE SENSITIVE RIGHT NOW.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.524
IT'S SELFISH, I KNOW,

17:04.565 --> 17:06.818
BUT RICHARD'S TRAVELING

17:04.565 --> 17:06.818
MORE THAN HE EVER DID.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.111
HE'S BEEN GONE THREE

17:06.860 --> 17:09.111
OF THE LAST FOUR WEEKS,

17:09.153 --> 17:10.947
NOW HE'S FINALLY HOME,

17:09.153 --> 17:10.947
AND SHE'S THERE,

17:10.989 --> 17:13.199
COMMANDING ALL OF HIS ATTENTION,

17:10.989 --> 17:13.199
ALL OF HIS TIME.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.452
I SOUND LIKE A SPOILED

17:14.701 --> 17:16.452
HIGH-SCHOOL GIRL.

17:16.494 --> 17:18.746
YOU STILL HAVEN'T ASKED FOR

17:16.494 --> 17:18.746
THE GLORIA VANDERBILT JEANS

17:18.788 --> 17:20.039
AND THE CONVERTIBLE RABBIT.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.041
NEVER MIND.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.041
I'M SORRY I KEPT YOU.

17:22.082 --> 17:25.378
I HAVE A SLIDE PROJECTOR. I'D BE

17:22.082 --> 17:25.378
HAPPY TO BRING IT OVER TONIGHT.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.421
OH, I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS,

17:25.419 --> 17:27.421
LORELAI.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.883
I MEAN IT.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.883
I COULDN'T BE MORE GRATEFUL.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.509
HOLD ON.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.509
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
