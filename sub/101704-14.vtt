I'm telling you,
this is not gonna be a problem.

- Sorry.

38:57.813 --> 38:59.815
My character was being
called into question,

38:59.859 --> 39:01.469
and I overreacted,

39:01.513 --> 39:04.951

into surgery?

39:06.866 --> 39:08.955
- Why would I do that?

39:08.998 --> 39:11.000
No, no, really,
why would I risk my job

39:11.044 --> 39:12.437
and my career for that?

39:12.480 --> 39:14.874
Why would I do that?
- I don't know, Dean.

39:14.917 --> 39:19.139
But given the circumstances
that happened today, I...

39:19.182 --> 39:20.793
it certainly seems plausible.

39:20.836 --> 39:22.316
- What do you want me to say?

39:22.360 --> 39:25.145
You want me to tell you
that I can't sleep nights,

39:25.188 --> 39:27.321
and I'm always looking
over my shoulder.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.975
That's the way
it's been for years.

39:29.018 --> 39:30.411
Is that what you want to hear?
- Of course not.

39:30.455 --> 39:31.847
I want you to be okay.

39:31.891 --> 39:35.938
- The idea of looking
at what happened over there,

39:35.982 --> 39:39.464
putting that
under a microscope...

39:39.507 --> 39:40.987
no way.

39:41.030 --> 39:43.163
I'm not doing that.
That scares the hell out of me.
