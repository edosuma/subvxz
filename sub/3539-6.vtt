00:00.833 --> 00:02.899
<i>Previously on</i>
Penny Dreadful...

00:02.935 --> 00:04.718
- They were here!
- Take it easy.

00:04.753 --> 00:06.169
I can't live
with this anymore.

00:06.221 --> 00:07.337
You're safe here.

00:07.339 --> 00:09.423
We've had some trouble
here in London. Murders.

00:09.475 --> 00:10.841
Were the people
who were killed shot?

00:10.843 --> 00:11.942
Not a one.

00:11.977 --> 00:13.477
How can I help?

00:13.512 --> 00:15.846
<i>There was something different
about the Mariner's Inn.</i>

00:15.898 --> 00:17.647
There was a survivor.

00:17.683 --> 00:20.684
I can honestly say I've never
met a woman like you.

00:20.686 --> 00:22.886
You have no idea.

00:25.023 --> 00:27.357
I care for who you are,
not what you wear.

00:27.359 --> 00:29.626
<i>I was having coffee
with a friend.</i>

00:29.661 --> 00:30.744
<i>He's in love with someone,</i>

00:30.779 --> 00:31.862
though I don't know
he knows it.

00:31.914 --> 00:33.296
<i>She touched his hand.</i>

00:33.332 --> 00:35.432
<i>And on his face...
A kind of peace.</i>

00:35.467 --> 00:36.967
It's lethal, that touch...

00:37.002 --> 00:39.503
<i>for it leaves your heart
at the mercy of another.</i>

00:39.538 --> 00:42.205
I don't know what got into me.
I have to be with you.

00:42.257 --> 00:43.840
It is the most important thing

00:43.876 --> 00:45.342
to have the flesh
of the enemy.

00:45.377 --> 00:48.445
<i>Consume it...
you take their power.</i>

00:48.480 --> 00:51.014
Your hair. So they got
what they came for.

00:51.049 --> 00:52.766
Utterly.
They're making a fetish.

00:52.801 --> 00:54.017
<i>A voodoo doll.</i>

03:55.984 --> 03:57.400
Good morning.

04:01.456 --> 04:03.490
How do you like your eggs?

05:06.605 --> 05:08.438
Sleep tight, dear.

05:09.441 --> 05:12.142
You're going to have
a challenging day.

05:20.035 --> 05:21.234
- Good morning.
- Oh.

05:21.286 --> 05:22.569
God!

05:22.621 --> 05:25.288
You can't see me
without my makeup.

05:25.323 --> 05:27.457
I'm a holy terror
in the morning.

05:28.326 --> 05:29.876
And how shall we
spend our day?

05:29.911 --> 05:31.711
I've got to go home
and change.

05:32.831 --> 05:34.664
Do you mind
if I bring some clothes here?

05:34.716 --> 05:36.082
Not at all.

05:36.918 --> 05:38.168
Then some shopping, perhaps?

05:38.837 --> 05:39.903
What do you favor,

05:39.938 --> 05:41.838
Burlington Arcade
or Bond Street?

05:41.873 --> 05:43.840
That's awfully public.

05:45.343 --> 05:46.726
Perhaps discretion.

05:47.479 --> 05:48.728
Anathema.

05:49.648 --> 05:51.564
In this house,
we celebrate the unusual.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.150
We set the tune,
and the world follows.

05:54.186 --> 05:55.852
That's a reckless philosophy.

05:55.904 --> 05:57.520
But exciting.

05:58.323 --> 06:00.073
The thrill of the forbidden?

06:00.108 --> 06:01.991
There's nothing to match that.

06:04.079 --> 06:05.361
In fact...

06:06.832 --> 06:08.398
I'm going to throw a ball.

06:10.435 --> 06:12.569
Invite everyone who's anyone.

06:13.572 --> 06:15.839
Let them gape
at our uniqueness.

06:15.874 --> 06:16.906
Dorian...

06:16.942 --> 06:19.843
You deserve
a proper coming out.

06:47.873 --> 06:50.039
Good morning!
Splendid day, isn't it?

06:50.909 --> 06:52.208
Sir Malcolm,
we need to speak with you.

06:52.878 --> 06:55.411
First, you must acknowledge
the splendidness of the day.

06:56.498 --> 06:57.947
Perhaps you should sit down.

06:59.167 --> 07:00.750
What is it?

07:01.753 --> 07:03.169
Why don't you
sit with me here?

07:03.221 --> 07:05.221
Vanessa, what's going on?

07:08.143 --> 07:09.926
Mr. Boyd came to see you.

07:09.978 --> 07:12.228
- My solicitor?
- Yes.

07:16.935 --> 07:18.818
You see...

07:18.854 --> 07:20.303
something awful's happened.

07:21.506 --> 07:22.505
Yes?

07:23.708 --> 07:25.441
I'm terribly sorry...

07:25.477 --> 07:27.177
but your wife is dead.

07:27.212 --> 07:28.578
Gladys?

07:29.681 --> 07:31.014
I'm so sorry.

07:33.084 --> 07:34.450
How?

07:34.486 --> 07:36.119
That's not important now.

07:37.005 --> 07:38.204
How?

07:41.793 --> 07:43.426
She took her own life.

07:43.461 --> 07:46.045
Gladys did?
That doesn't seem like her.

07:51.002 --> 07:52.402
If there's anything
we can do...

07:52.437 --> 07:54.404
How did she take her own life?

07:54.439 --> 07:56.606
- I really don't think...
- She cut her own throat.

07:56.641 --> 07:57.857
Where?

07:59.644 --> 08:02.412
- "Where?"
- Where did she do it?

08:02.447 --> 08:04.347
In the master bedroom,
apparently...

08:04.382 --> 08:06.482
at the country house.

08:06.534 --> 08:08.318
Oh, I see.

08:11.239 --> 08:13.790
I shall have to have
the carpet replaced then.

08:16.578 --> 08:18.494
Good morning. Morning.

09:50.722 --> 09:53.306
Of course, I can't
mold them from scratch,

09:53.341 --> 09:55.091
we've a man who does that.

09:55.093 --> 09:57.293
But I give them
that final touch of life.

09:58.463 --> 10:00.296
It's very impressive,
all told.

10:00.332 --> 10:02.298
Oh, yes.

10:03.201 --> 10:04.367
Well, I like to think
my blindness

10:04.402 --> 10:05.902
makes my fingers
a bit more sensitive

10:05.937 --> 10:07.470
to the nuances.

10:09.107 --> 10:10.173
Here, I'll show you.

10:10.208 --> 10:11.574
Come over here.

10:14.863 --> 10:16.362
Let me take your hand.

10:22.954 --> 10:24.220
It's so cold.

10:24.255 --> 10:25.755
Sorry, Miss. It's...

10:27.208 --> 10:28.674
It's how I am.

10:28.710 --> 10:29.842
No. It's too cold, I mean.

10:29.878 --> 10:32.061
It doesn't feel fully alive.

10:32.097 --> 10:34.564
- Sorry, Miss. I've work to do.
- Wait!

10:36.551 --> 10:38.634
Mr. Clare...

10:38.636 --> 10:40.720
why does your hand
not feel alive?

10:41.723 --> 10:43.356
I can't speak to that, Miss.

10:43.391 --> 10:45.024
It is how it is.

10:45.060 --> 10:47.009
Then why am I frightened?

10:48.113 --> 10:49.612
You've no cause.

10:49.647 --> 10:51.881
Whatever your past...

10:51.916 --> 10:53.483
I know you are kind.

10:55.453 --> 10:57.086
But why am I frightened?

10:57.756 --> 10:59.205
There you are!

10:59.240 --> 11:01.290
We've veritable
mountains of work

11:01.326 --> 11:03.259
before the crime scenes
open tomorrow.

11:03.294 --> 11:04.911
Grab some blood, come along.

11:04.963 --> 11:05.995
Yes, sir.

11:05.997 --> 11:08.798
By the way, I'm expanding
down here in the cellar

11:08.833 --> 11:10.299
for a new attraction.

11:10.335 --> 11:11.300
More crime scenes?

11:12.003 --> 11:13.753
Something much more ingenious.

11:15.056 --> 11:16.722
There'll be some
construction work,

11:16.758 --> 11:18.007
but I've hired others
for that,

11:18.009 --> 11:19.842
so no need to bother about it.

11:19.894 --> 11:21.611
What's the attraction?

11:21.646 --> 11:23.312
Just another ballyhoo.

11:24.682 --> 11:26.849
See you at luncheon, dear.

11:29.020 --> 11:30.269
Come along.

11:52.544 --> 11:54.377
It's like he doesn't care.

11:54.379 --> 11:57.130
When he found his son dead,
I was there.

11:58.216 --> 11:59.949
This is not him.

12:00.785 --> 12:02.318
- Maybe he just needs time.
- This...

12:03.421 --> 12:05.021
is not him.

12:15.567 --> 12:17.950
Maybe he doesn't
really care that much.

12:20.488 --> 12:22.071
Not all deaths
are the tragedies

12:22.073 --> 12:23.656
we think they should be.

12:25.543 --> 12:28.044
The woman cut her own throat
with his razor.

12:33.051 --> 12:34.500
Mr. Chandler.

12:35.503 --> 12:36.619
You have a visitor.

13:04.832 --> 13:06.332
Hello, old pal.

13:09.087 --> 13:11.087
Gonna introduce me?

13:13.208 --> 13:15.091
Give us the room.

13:37.532 --> 13:40.032
Hell of a nice setup
you got here.

13:42.153 --> 13:44.904
Much more commodious
than the old place

13:44.989 --> 13:47.957
and I dare say
much less blood splatter.

13:51.162 --> 13:52.628
Planning for a battle?

13:52.664 --> 13:53.996
You tell me.

13:55.366 --> 13:56.882
I just smiled at that.

13:58.253 --> 13:59.919
Can't tell
if you can see that.

13:59.971 --> 14:02.755
Still getting used
to the brace, you understand.

14:02.807 --> 14:05.975
Hard to express much through
a quarter-inch of leather.

14:07.345 --> 14:09.278
You're not gonna try
and gun me down, are you?

14:09.314 --> 14:11.080
Give me one reason
I shouldn't.

14:11.115 --> 14:13.549
Come on, sport,

14:13.585 --> 14:15.518
in cold blood,

14:15.553 --> 14:17.653
right in the middle of this
fashionable drawing room

14:17.689 --> 14:19.355
with your friends outside?

14:19.390 --> 14:20.890
What do you want?

14:22.827 --> 14:25.444
- Can I tell you a story?
- No.

14:26.331 --> 14:27.630
It's not long.

14:28.499 --> 14:30.366
I figure you owe me
at least that.

14:34.839 --> 14:36.922
Before I became
the fine Pinkerton man

14:36.958 --> 14:38.457
you see before you,

14:38.509 --> 14:40.092
I was a Texas Ranger.

14:41.379 --> 14:44.714
We was after some Mexicans,
rustlers they were.

14:47.468 --> 14:49.552
We spent months
on their trail.

14:50.555 --> 14:52.438
Finally, we captured them.

14:53.725 --> 14:54.857
End of the day

14:54.892 --> 14:57.026
we were so fucking sick
of hunting them

14:57.061 --> 14:59.562
that we couldn't face
dragging them back to Abilene,

14:59.564 --> 15:02.982
so we shot them down,
took their scalps.

15:03.034 --> 15:05.368
Which fulfilled the warrant,
you see.

15:06.487 --> 15:08.404
It was proof of apprehension,

15:08.456 --> 15:10.039
as the lawyers say.

15:10.074 --> 15:12.108
I'm not going back to America.

15:14.045 --> 15:15.411
Oh, you are.

15:16.331 --> 15:19.248
Or maybe I'll sell you
to a freak show.

15:19.300 --> 15:20.966
That's quite a trick you have.

15:21.002 --> 15:24.220
Never seen the like,
and I've seen most everything.

15:26.924 --> 15:29.925
Now there will be
no more fisticuffs

15:29.927 --> 15:31.811
or gunplay between us.

15:32.930 --> 15:35.231
Your daddy wants you back
in the all-together,

15:35.266 --> 15:36.632
so back you go.

15:40.104 --> 15:41.270
You know...

15:42.774 --> 15:44.990
I see you
outside of this house...

15:46.494 --> 15:48.110
and I'll kill ya.

15:50.365 --> 15:51.580
Well...

15:52.667 --> 15:54.283
you might try.

15:56.587 --> 16:00.039
But let me present
an alternative tale for you.

16:03.094 --> 16:04.960
Say you fall asleep.

16:06.297 --> 16:07.763
Say you take a walk.

16:09.267 --> 16:10.766
Say you blink.

16:12.103 --> 16:13.836
Say I come in here.

16:13.871 --> 16:15.771
I can do it, you know that.

16:16.808 --> 16:19.392
There's no door
that can keep out the devil.

16:20.745 --> 16:23.579
Say I have my Bowie knife.

16:23.614 --> 16:25.030
Say I roam.

16:28.119 --> 16:29.735
Say I take the scalps

16:29.787 --> 16:32.571
of every blessed person
under this roof.

16:36.544 --> 16:39.228
Mr. Chandler,
I bid you good day,

16:39.263 --> 16:41.964
and I await a speedy
and pacific resolution

16:41.999 --> 16:43.999
to our particular situation.

16:50.508 --> 16:54.393
Your girlfriend there
is on the second floor...

16:54.429 --> 16:55.978
at the back...

16:57.014 --> 16:58.514
corner window.

17:01.018 --> 17:03.152
Such hair she has.

17:21.172 --> 17:22.538
You're forever trying
something else,

17:22.589 --> 17:23.756
that's the problem.

17:23.790 --> 17:25.124
The public's imagination

17:25.175 --> 17:27.710
soon tires of the familiar.

17:27.762 --> 17:30.379
Repetition is
the bane of sensationalism.

17:30.431 --> 17:31.881
Well,
we'll soon see, won't we?

17:31.933 --> 17:33.349
Mr. Clare.

17:35.603 --> 17:37.620
There's something wrong
about Mr. Clare.

17:39.090 --> 17:40.689
What do you mean?

17:43.561 --> 17:45.227
I touched his hand today.

17:46.898 --> 17:47.997
It was cold.

17:48.032 --> 17:49.899
Lots of people
have cold hands.

17:49.934 --> 17:51.066
Not like his.

17:53.137 --> 17:54.403
It's like...

17:56.741 --> 17:59.074
It's like
he's not really alive.

18:04.749 --> 18:06.248
Go on, my dear.

18:09.086 --> 18:11.587
"He took us
by our winged backs

18:11.589 --> 18:13.556
and raised us over His head.

18:13.591 --> 18:16.392
Thence did he fling us
from his Heavenly Throne

18:16.427 --> 18:17.593
and...

18:17.645 --> 18:19.678
and cast us down,
to Earth and to Hell.

18:19.730 --> 18:21.313
So we were..."

18:21.349 --> 18:22.932
Damned?

18:22.934 --> 18:24.650
At the very least.

18:24.685 --> 18:27.603
I'm sorry, this is
a fascinating narrative...

18:28.823 --> 18:30.940
but I don't see
it's much help to us.

18:30.975 --> 18:32.708
It's the hidden language
of the demon.

18:34.078 --> 18:35.911
It must have a purpose.

18:35.947 --> 18:37.947
Not everything does.

18:37.982 --> 18:40.282
Hmm. You sound like
my friend Mr. Clare.

18:43.671 --> 18:45.454
What did you say?

18:45.506 --> 18:47.122
A man I met recently.

18:47.174 --> 18:49.258
Same name as the poet,
John Clare.

18:51.295 --> 18:53.796
He breaks my heart, Mr. Clare.

18:53.798 --> 18:55.464
A kindred spirit, I think.

18:56.434 --> 18:58.267
We met in the strangest way.

18:59.720 --> 19:01.370
Is it random we met,
I wonder...

19:02.073 --> 19:04.707
or is there a hidden design,
like these relics?

19:05.943 --> 19:07.192
Science would tell us...

19:07.979 --> 19:09.645
there's always
an inner clockwork.

19:10.615 --> 19:11.847
Nothing is happenstance.

19:13.484 --> 19:14.884
Yet you wear a flower.

19:17.488 --> 19:18.821
How's your cousin?

19:20.575 --> 19:21.991
Functioning.

19:23.294 --> 19:24.877
You can't fool me, Doctor.

19:24.912 --> 19:26.629
I saw your eyes light on hers.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.633
It's the oddest thing,
Miss Ives.

19:32.003 --> 19:35.004
My whole life,
I've thought I was...

19:35.056 --> 19:37.306
bound to live
with exceptionality.

19:38.392 --> 19:39.642
I was not like my brothers.

19:39.677 --> 19:41.477
I was resolutely this...

19:43.247 --> 19:45.648
disjointed thing,
this freakish thing.

19:47.518 --> 19:50.119
So I came to celebrate
what uniqueness I had.

19:50.154 --> 19:51.453
And now?

19:53.090 --> 19:54.657
I wear a flower!

19:56.994 --> 19:59.778
I find, lo and behold...

19:59.830 --> 20:01.096
I'm just like everyone else.

20:01.132 --> 20:02.998
Then I'm glad for you.

20:08.122 --> 20:09.622
My cousin and I...

20:10.625 --> 20:12.625
it's not without
its complications.

20:14.095 --> 20:17.596
That's what they call
the workings inside watches,

20:17.632 --> 20:19.381
did you know that?

20:19.433 --> 20:22.051
The intricate gears
and mechanisms.

20:23.137 --> 20:24.887
Complications.

20:24.889 --> 20:26.555
Then enjoy them, Doctor.

20:26.607 --> 20:29.692
They will tick away,
no matter what we do.

20:32.396 --> 20:34.096
Mr. Gray for you.

20:35.282 --> 20:36.732
Show him in.

20:43.658 --> 20:44.657
Miss Ives.

20:45.826 --> 20:47.076
Mr. Gray.

20:47.912 --> 20:49.845
May I present
Dr. Victor Frankenstein.

20:50.548 --> 20:52.081
- How do you do?
- Mr. Gray.

20:53.834 --> 20:54.833
I like your flower.

20:57.054 --> 21:00.389
- I come bearing adventure.
- When do you not?

21:00.424 --> 21:02.141
I'm hosting a ball.

21:02.226 --> 21:03.926
I wanted to
invite you personally.

21:03.978 --> 21:05.477
And Sir Malcolm, of course.

21:06.430 --> 21:08.230
Would you do me
the courtesy of attending?

21:09.934 --> 21:11.867
Oh, I haven't been to a ball
in some time.

21:11.902 --> 21:13.602
There's a woman
I'd like you to meet.

21:15.072 --> 21:16.605
It's rather
a coming out for her.

21:19.026 --> 21:21.710
It seems the world is filled
with romance these days.

21:21.779 --> 21:23.312
I would love to
have you meet her.

21:23.347 --> 21:24.863
And, Doctor, of course
you must come.

21:24.915 --> 21:25.948
I'll get your address

21:26.000 --> 21:27.449
and dispatch an invitation
if I might.

21:27.485 --> 21:29.051
That's very kind, thank you.

21:29.086 --> 21:30.953
Do say you'll think about it.

21:32.423 --> 21:35.374
- Of course, Mr. Gray.
- Is it not Dorian?

21:36.711 --> 21:38.260
After all this time?

21:40.965 --> 21:42.598
It is safely Dorian.

21:44.435 --> 21:45.884
Then I'll bid you good day.

21:47.104 --> 21:48.437
Doctor.

21:49.440 --> 21:50.606
Vanessa.

22:00.117 --> 22:01.984
So, Doctor,

22:02.036 --> 22:03.702
will you give me
the first dance?

22:06.240 --> 22:07.723
Perhaps the second.

22:14.165 --> 22:16.665
Come in.

22:28.763 --> 22:29.978
Ah, Vanessa.

22:30.815 --> 22:32.648
What do you think of my beard?

22:32.683 --> 22:34.850
- I'm sorry?
- My beard.

22:34.852 --> 22:37.069
I've had it
for as long as I can remember,

22:37.104 --> 22:39.354
but I don't know
that it entirely suits me.

22:40.491 --> 22:41.990
Why not?

22:42.026 --> 22:43.826
It makes me look older.

22:45.129 --> 22:46.528
Sir Malcolm.

22:47.498 --> 22:49.198
Is everything all right?

22:49.950 --> 22:51.266
What do you mean?

22:52.970 --> 22:55.904
You're not as I thought
you might be.

22:57.341 --> 22:58.624
Ah.

22:59.710 --> 23:01.627
You mean Gladys, poor thing.

23:01.679 --> 23:03.262
I'm not going down
to the funeral.

23:03.297 --> 23:05.180
So much going on here.

23:08.803 --> 23:10.052
What's that?

23:12.273 --> 23:14.022
Yes, it's, uh...
it's an invitation.

23:14.058 --> 23:16.525
Mr. Gray's hosting a ball.
I was confident you wouldn't...

23:16.560 --> 23:19.895
Do you know, I've not been
to a ball in ages.

23:21.699 --> 23:23.665
I used to be quite the dancer
in my salad days,

23:23.701 --> 23:25.801
if you can believe
such a thing.

23:25.836 --> 23:27.402
Of course I'll attend.

23:27.438 --> 23:30.239
Can you find
a proper escort without me?

23:30.291 --> 23:31.456
What?

23:32.710 --> 23:33.826
Yes.

23:35.846 --> 23:37.279
I just don't know.

23:45.806 --> 23:47.806
Of course I'll attend.

23:47.842 --> 23:50.926
My gallant young swain
was most insistent.

23:53.814 --> 23:55.497
Poor love-addled fool.

23:55.533 --> 23:57.032
Are you sure that's wise?

23:57.067 --> 23:59.401
Miss Ives will be there.

23:59.436 --> 24:02.237
The time comes when the spider
must touch the fly.

24:02.273 --> 24:04.673
And if the fly
eats the spider?

24:08.245 --> 24:09.361
You admire her.

24:10.915 --> 24:12.164
Fine.

24:13.417 --> 24:15.751
In our dolorous old bestiary,

24:15.786 --> 24:19.588
she's a truly...
unique creature.

24:19.623 --> 24:21.023
More than you know.

24:24.511 --> 24:27.129
Did you know
that during the Renaissance...

24:27.181 --> 24:29.464
women used to put poison
into their eyes?

24:30.551 --> 24:33.719
A little drop of belladonna
to dilate the pupil...

24:34.688 --> 24:37.389
to simulate erotic excitement.

24:39.693 --> 24:41.777
But like all addictions,
it took more and more

24:41.812 --> 24:43.812
to produce the desired effect.

24:44.732 --> 24:48.650
So they slowly...
killed themselves.

24:52.122 --> 24:54.122
What won't we do for beauty?

24:55.159 --> 24:56.558
And youth.

24:57.661 --> 24:58.827
Ah, yes.

25:00.831 --> 25:02.130
Youth.

25:04.001 --> 25:06.218
That takes more than
a drop of poison.

25:08.172 --> 25:10.923
That takes everything...
doesn't it?

25:18.432 --> 25:20.399
Such a price we pay.

25:24.438 --> 25:26.188
Such a price.

25:30.611 --> 25:32.277
Despite what you may think...

25:33.664 --> 25:35.530
I didn't turn from God.

25:37.418 --> 25:38.951
He turned from me.

25:40.004 --> 25:41.370
From all of us.

25:42.423 --> 25:43.755
Look around.

25:44.708 --> 25:46.591
You tell me, where is He...

25:46.627 --> 25:48.794
in this city
of perpetual suffering?

25:48.846 --> 25:50.295
In this life?

25:52.099 --> 25:53.282
You tell me where.

25:53.317 --> 25:56.301
There are those who say
you can find Him within.

25:57.554 --> 25:58.854
They're wrong.

26:04.728 --> 26:06.228
So...

26:08.649 --> 26:09.698
we must carry on...

26:12.069 --> 26:14.953
and earn our reward
from the Master.

26:16.874 --> 26:18.407
And that reward?

26:22.796 --> 26:25.497
To live forever
while the world suffers.

26:30.721 --> 26:32.838
Such a sad prize, isn't it?

26:51.825 --> 26:53.525
We've had an invitation.

26:54.778 --> 26:55.861
To a ball.

26:57.498 --> 27:00.115
- Quite the gala, I imagine.
- Are we going to go?

27:01.785 --> 27:02.818
We would have to prepare.

27:03.921 --> 27:05.337
Dancing, for one.

27:05.956 --> 27:07.589
And there would be
a lot of people you don't know

27:07.624 --> 27:08.957
you'd have to talk with.

27:10.227 --> 27:11.793
You're afraid
I'll embarrass you.

27:11.845 --> 27:13.512
No.

27:13.547 --> 27:14.963
No.

27:15.015 --> 27:16.348
You could never do that.

27:16.383 --> 27:18.050
I'll work very hard not to.

27:18.969 --> 27:20.268
I promise you.

27:25.476 --> 27:27.642
Of course we'll go.
It's a ball.

27:30.064 --> 27:31.279
What's the worst
that could happen?

27:31.315 --> 27:33.031
Who's giving the ball?

27:33.067 --> 27:34.533
A fellow I met today...

27:35.569 --> 27:37.953
name of Dorian Gray.

27:37.988 --> 27:39.654
- What are you making?
- Shepherd's pie.

27:39.656 --> 27:41.790
Now go upstairs.
I'll call you when it's ready.

27:41.825 --> 27:43.158
Ah, ah!

27:45.996 --> 27:47.162
Mmm.

27:53.170 --> 27:55.504
Step up, step in!

27:55.506 --> 27:57.889
Awaiting you, a panoply

27:57.925 --> 28:01.009
of London's most
heinous crimes

28:01.011 --> 28:02.894
in living color!

28:02.930 --> 28:06.148
Explore the lurid byways

28:06.183 --> 28:10.752
of terrible homicide
and atrocious depravity!

28:11.522 --> 28:15.023
Step inside
and steel yourself...

28:15.025 --> 28:18.660
Witness the gruesome marvels

28:18.695 --> 28:20.529
of genuine terror

28:20.581 --> 28:23.582
as they unfold before you.

28:23.617 --> 28:26.668
Putney! Putney Wax Works!

28:34.823 --> 28:38.731
_

28:39.383 --> 28:40.465
"Whodunit?"

28:42.386 --> 28:44.186
- Inspector.
- Mr. Chandler.

28:45.355 --> 28:46.638
Is it realistic?

28:47.641 --> 28:48.890
What?

28:49.810 --> 28:51.226
The depiction of the inn.

28:51.945 --> 28:53.628
Can't rightly recall.

28:53.664 --> 28:56.231
Place didn't leave
much of an impression.

28:56.283 --> 28:58.733
- And the crime scene?
- Oh, very accurate.

28:59.953 --> 29:02.237
I think they must have gained
access to our photographs.

29:02.289 --> 29:04.539
Not all of the particulars,
of course.

29:04.575 --> 29:07.209
- Such as?
- There was more cannibalism.

29:10.581 --> 29:12.581
When I was in the Transvaal...

29:13.383 --> 29:15.000
I saw lions feed.

29:16.053 --> 29:18.386
It was much like
the Mariner's Inn.

29:18.422 --> 29:22.824
They were always tearing
pieces off and stealing away.

29:22.860 --> 29:25.594
With a purpose... to eat.

29:25.596 --> 29:26.845
Not always.

29:28.482 --> 29:31.650
Sometimes a shock
would run through the animals,

29:31.685 --> 29:33.602
like a tremor,

29:33.604 --> 29:35.270
for no reason at all.

29:37.274 --> 29:38.573
A kind of bloodlust.

29:40.577 --> 29:44.162
I often wondered if they
remembered it afterwards...

29:44.198 --> 29:46.114
this frenzy.

29:47.784 --> 29:48.783
What do you think?

29:50.120 --> 29:52.387
I've no experience
with lions, I'm glad to say.

29:52.422 --> 29:54.956
Well, other predators then?
In America.

29:54.992 --> 29:56.625
Grizzly bears, I suppose.

29:56.677 --> 29:57.926
Hmm.

30:00.681 --> 30:01.696
Wolves?

30:03.300 --> 30:04.332
I suppose.

30:05.135 --> 30:06.134
Why are you here?

30:07.271 --> 30:09.204
I saw the sign. And you?

30:09.239 --> 30:10.805
Well...

30:10.857 --> 30:13.191
it's an old trope
but not without merit...

30:14.111 --> 30:16.978
the murderer returning
to the scene of the crime

30:16.980 --> 30:18.897
to relive the glory of it.

30:18.949 --> 30:21.049
Only here enacted in wax.

30:24.621 --> 30:26.238
I know you're involved.

30:27.708 --> 30:29.791
- And your proof?
- I'll find it.

30:31.245 --> 30:32.994
I always find things.

30:32.996 --> 30:35.380
When they cut off my arm,
I was anesthetized.

30:35.415 --> 30:36.798
When I woke...

30:37.501 --> 30:41.002
I went and found it
in a pile of discarded limbs,

30:41.054 --> 30:42.587
not unlike this tableaux.

30:44.174 --> 30:47.142
- What did you do with it?
- Oh, I tossed it back.

30:49.012 --> 30:52.063
I just needed to finish
the story in my own way.

30:53.016 --> 30:55.850
Write "finis"
in bold letters...

30:56.987 --> 30:58.570
and move on.

30:58.605 --> 30:59.688
Then I wish you luck

30:59.773 --> 31:01.156
rooting through
this pile of bodies.

31:01.191 --> 31:02.907
Thank you, Mr. Chandler.

31:02.943 --> 31:04.192
And don't worry,

31:04.244 --> 31:06.161
we shan't try and follow you
this time.

31:06.196 --> 31:07.629
No need.

31:07.664 --> 31:08.830
Why's that?

31:08.865 --> 31:10.265
Because no man involved
in crimes like this

31:10.300 --> 31:12.233
can live with them forever.

31:14.871 --> 31:17.339
Better the quick hanging...

31:17.374 --> 31:19.708
than the slow torture
of guilt, eh?

31:33.774 --> 31:38.226
Fish, fresh fish!
Fresh today.

31:38.228 --> 31:39.728
Read all about it!

32:05.922 --> 32:07.172
Mr. Chandler.

32:08.258 --> 32:09.257
Mr. Chandler!

32:10.727 --> 32:13.428
Miss Ives... sorry.

32:13.430 --> 32:14.763
Is everything all right?

32:14.815 --> 32:16.831
Lot on my mind.

32:18.769 --> 32:20.435
I've a personal request,
if I may.

32:22.606 --> 32:25.023
I... I was wondering
if you might like

32:25.075 --> 32:26.908
to accompany me somewhere.

32:26.943 --> 32:28.360
To a ball, actually.

32:29.363 --> 32:31.946
- As your escort, you mean?
- Yes.

32:33.383 --> 32:35.867
- When is it?
- Friday.

32:37.587 --> 32:38.653
Friday.

32:41.558 --> 32:43.007
No, I can't.

33:06.400 --> 33:07.649
Ah!

33:09.319 --> 33:10.819
Oh, you did!

33:10.821 --> 33:11.953
No, I...

33:14.040 --> 33:15.457
...very naughty boy.

33:18.161 --> 33:19.627
Do come with me.

33:23.667 --> 33:25.133
...your good health
with me.

33:25.168 --> 33:26.468
Absolutely.

33:50.577 --> 33:52.360
- Miss Poole.
- Mr. Lyle.

33:56.700 --> 33:58.199
Will you dance with me?

33:59.503 --> 34:01.836
Oh, I would be a poor partner.

34:01.872 --> 34:03.204
I can't imagine
you're not schooled

34:03.290 --> 34:05.123
in all the social graces...

34:07.127 --> 34:09.210
especially mendacity
and betrayal.

34:11.181 --> 34:13.047
I'm not sure what game
you're playing, my dear,

34:13.049 --> 34:15.016
but I so enjoy
watching your scales

34:15.051 --> 34:16.717
catch the light as you coil.

34:16.770 --> 34:18.636
Don't you like games,
Mr. Lyle?

34:18.688 --> 34:19.771
Some.

34:21.942 --> 34:24.025
And is your mother
aware of yours?

34:24.060 --> 34:26.360
My mother has
games of her own.

34:26.396 --> 34:29.563
Mine are more far-sighted.

34:29.616 --> 34:30.982
But there's time enough
for that.

34:31.034 --> 34:33.451
I am, after all, very young.

34:35.371 --> 34:36.654
As is she.

34:37.873 --> 34:39.072
For now.

36:20.427 --> 36:23.177
My Lord! Victor!

36:25.265 --> 36:26.848
Rather puts our tiny rooms
to shame.

36:26.900 --> 36:28.182
No, it doesn't.

36:46.002 --> 36:48.369
Doctor Frankenstein,
good evening.

36:49.623 --> 36:52.040
May I present
Miss Hecate Poole.

36:52.042 --> 36:53.174
Miss Poole.

36:53.209 --> 36:54.926
This is my cousin, Lily.

36:54.961 --> 36:56.044
And Mr. Lyle.

36:56.096 --> 36:58.129
- Charmed.
- Miss Lily.

36:58.181 --> 36:59.914
Such beautiful jewelry.

37:00.717 --> 37:02.216
Oh, they're very old.

37:02.218 --> 37:03.851
Scarabs, I think they are.

37:06.890 --> 37:11.192
- Hecate is an unusual name.
- I had unusual parentage.

37:11.945 --> 37:14.228
Now, please tell me you will
dance with me, Doctor.

37:14.230 --> 37:17.398
Mr. Lyle is proving oddly
recalcitrant to my desires.

37:17.450 --> 37:20.234
Perhaps later.
I'm promised to my cousin.

37:20.286 --> 37:21.536
I'm bereft.

37:21.571 --> 37:23.121
Come along, Miss Poole.

37:23.156 --> 37:25.456
We'll drown your sorrows
elsewhere.

37:32.048 --> 37:34.716
Oh, Victor,
this is all so splendid.

37:34.751 --> 37:36.334
But I have
the funniest feeling

37:36.386 --> 37:38.803
I've been in this room before.

37:38.838 --> 37:40.388
I would think that unlikely.

37:41.257 --> 37:43.391
Will you really dance with me?

37:44.761 --> 37:46.477
If you'll do me the courtesy.

38:23.099 --> 38:24.532
Doctor Frankenstein, hello.

38:24.567 --> 38:25.933
Mr. Gray,

38:25.969 --> 38:28.136
thank you so much
for having us.

38:29.472 --> 38:31.739
This is my cousin,

38:31.775 --> 38:33.274
Miss Lily Frankenstein.

38:34.360 --> 38:37.145
Mr. Dorian Gray,
our generous host.

38:38.698 --> 38:40.698
May I present Miss Angelique.

38:40.734 --> 38:41.783
How do you do?

38:41.818 --> 38:43.117
Doctor, Miss Lily.

38:43.787 --> 38:44.986
That's a shattering dress.

38:45.038 --> 38:46.404
Thank you.

38:47.991 --> 38:49.540
Miss Lily...

38:49.576 --> 38:51.659
will you do me the honor
of this dance?

38:58.334 --> 38:59.667
We're abandoned, Doctor.

38:59.669 --> 39:02.303
I think some champagne, yes?

39:02.338 --> 39:04.338
I don't drink spirits.

39:04.340 --> 39:06.040
I won't hold that against you.

39:26.246 --> 39:29.163
- You dance beautifully.
- Surely not.

39:29.199 --> 39:31.332
Though Victor did his best
to teach me.

39:33.369 --> 39:35.036
Do you like the room?

39:37.090 --> 39:38.623
All those paintings
looking down

39:38.675 --> 39:40.241
make me a bit nervous.

39:40.794 --> 39:42.960
I have the strangest sense
we've met before.

39:44.214 --> 39:45.680
Do you think that's possible?

39:46.549 --> 39:48.132
In some other lifetime?

39:49.552 --> 39:51.552
I don't know that
there are other lifetimes.

39:51.554 --> 39:53.554
Surely there are.

39:53.606 --> 39:54.889
Echoes of the past everywhere.

39:56.142 --> 39:58.526
My past, your past.

40:00.563 --> 40:01.896
Can't you feel it?

40:03.116 --> 40:04.532
Perhaps I can.

40:08.238 --> 40:11.155
Your hands.
They're... cool to the touch.

40:11.207 --> 40:14.075
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't be. They suit you...

40:14.794 --> 40:16.711
like the touch of marble.

40:22.168 --> 40:25.153
Do you think it bold
if I compliment your eyes?

40:27.307 --> 40:28.422
Yes.

40:29.425 --> 40:30.975
But please do.

41:22.061 --> 41:24.061
Will you help me
with something?

41:40.797 --> 41:42.546
Miss Ives
is without an escort.

41:42.582 --> 41:44.131
Very daring, she is.

41:44.167 --> 41:46.550
- What are you up to?
- Be still, little man.

41:49.138 --> 41:50.671
You mustn't hurt her.

41:50.673 --> 41:54.091
Oh, believe me,
she is sacrosanct.

42:00.183 --> 42:02.717
- Doctor, hello.
- Miss Ives.

42:03.569 --> 42:05.653
May I present Miss Angelique,

42:05.688 --> 42:06.921
Mr. Gray's companion
this evening.

42:09.692 --> 42:10.825
How do you do.

42:12.362 --> 42:14.629
I understand you're rather
the guest of honor tonight.

42:14.664 --> 42:16.163
Apparently so.

42:34.300 --> 42:37.051
Hello, Miss Ives.
I'm so glad you could come.

42:37.053 --> 42:38.602
My pleasure.

42:38.638 --> 42:39.654
Lily, you look lovely.

42:40.356 --> 42:42.023
Mr. Gray says pink's my color.

42:42.058 --> 42:43.791
Well, he would know.

42:43.826 --> 42:45.943
Some women
should only wear pale colors.

42:45.979 --> 42:48.729
- May I have this dance, Lily?
- Don't steal her yet.

42:48.731 --> 42:50.364
May I stay and talk?

42:51.067 --> 42:52.650
Victor's afraid
I'll embarrass him.

42:53.403 --> 42:54.468
You couldn't.

42:54.504 --> 42:57.405
Natural grace,
unschooled by society...

42:57.457 --> 42:59.073
that's the greatest gift,
isn't it?

42:59.075 --> 43:00.825
Lots of natural grace
in the country.

43:00.877 --> 43:02.293
I grew up
in the country.

43:02.328 --> 43:03.477
- Oh, where?
- Lake District.

43:04.330 --> 43:05.413
The realm of poets.

43:05.415 --> 43:07.248
And livestock.

43:07.250 --> 43:09.550
- Dance with me, Dorian.
- In a moment.

43:10.303 --> 43:11.669
First, a toast.

43:12.805 --> 43:13.921
She doesn't drink spirits.

43:13.923 --> 43:15.489
Maybe just a sip.

43:16.759 --> 43:17.758
As you say.

43:18.811 --> 43:19.860
None for you, Doctor?

43:20.763 --> 43:21.812
No.

43:23.516 --> 43:25.566
He's very wise, our doctor.

43:25.601 --> 43:27.935
I don't know what we'd do
without his level head.

43:27.937 --> 43:29.603
Not sure this is a night
for level heads,

43:29.605 --> 43:30.821
is it, darling?

43:30.857 --> 43:32.907
It's a night for anything but.

43:32.942 --> 43:33.941
Welcome to my home.

43:34.777 --> 43:36.110
To my dear Angelique.

43:36.779 --> 43:39.113
And a special welcome

43:39.165 --> 43:41.449
to Miss Frankenstein
to our glorious city.

43:42.618 --> 43:43.617
Cheers.

43:59.519 --> 44:00.768
Thank you.

44:05.608 --> 44:06.807
Good evening.

44:10.146 --> 44:13.647
Oh, it's fantastic, Malcolm.

44:26.963 --> 44:29.246
I wanted her to
succeed here tonight. I...

44:29.966 --> 44:32.049
Be still your heart, Doctor.

44:32.085 --> 44:33.434
This is but one evening.

44:33.469 --> 44:35.069
Mr. Gray is being
a proper host

44:35.104 --> 44:37.171
to a new guest, that's all.

44:38.724 --> 44:40.174
You're smarter than that,
Miss Ives.

44:43.062 --> 44:44.678
I wanted her to have life.

44:46.682 --> 44:48.149
Now she does.

45:03.866 --> 45:06.200
Miss Ives, good evening.
Dr. Frankenstein.

45:06.252 --> 45:08.369
I don't believe
you know Mrs. Poole.

45:08.371 --> 45:10.704
- How do you do.
- Doctor.

45:11.874 --> 45:14.208
And of course I remember
dear Miss Ives.

45:15.962 --> 45:18.879
It was the seance.
Madame Kali?

45:20.133 --> 45:22.349
Oh! Of course.

45:23.769 --> 45:26.554
So you shaved your beard
after all.

45:26.556 --> 45:28.055
Quite alarming, the change.

45:28.057 --> 45:29.773
I banished the old bear
to the cave

45:29.809 --> 45:30.891
and lured out the cub.

45:30.943 --> 45:32.560
I feel
like a new man.

45:32.562 --> 45:34.061
I've even been
boasting shamelessly

45:34.063 --> 45:36.280
to Evelyn about
my dancing prowess.

45:36.315 --> 45:37.465
Then you must.

45:37.934 --> 45:40.234
Hold on tightly.
It's a complicated dance.

45:40.236 --> 45:41.235
Excuse me.

45:43.873 --> 45:45.623
Shall we take to the floor?

45:47.293 --> 45:49.210
Perhaps a drink first,
Malcolm?

45:49.245 --> 45:50.995
With pleasure, my dear.

45:57.637 --> 46:01.255
- He's a changed man.
- Is he?

46:01.307 --> 46:04.675
Since he became reacquainted
with you, I mean.

46:04.727 --> 46:07.261
Well...
he has shaved his beard.

46:08.564 --> 46:11.148
Interestingly, I wasn't
speaking of his facial hair.

46:12.101 --> 46:13.100
What then?

46:13.903 --> 46:16.270
More his...
friendship with you.

46:16.272 --> 46:19.273
No more than a touch of warmth
in the winter of his years.

46:20.526 --> 46:23.511
I've known him for some time,
and never like this.

46:23.546 --> 46:25.446
You're a friend of his
late daughter, I believe.

46:26.666 --> 46:28.115
And his late wife.

46:28.167 --> 46:30.000
Such a tragedy.

46:31.420 --> 46:32.920
Life does batter at us.

46:33.623 --> 46:35.206
But we must persevere
with spirit

46:35.258 --> 46:37.591
for as long as
we possibly can.

46:37.627 --> 46:39.660
That's the trick to staying
young, don't you think?

46:40.796 --> 46:42.930
That's not a trick I seek.

46:43.666 --> 46:46.133
He speaks very highly of you,
Mrs. Poole.

46:46.135 --> 46:48.719
While he speaks of you
so rarely.

46:48.771 --> 46:49.803
I suppose we could say

46:49.805 --> 46:51.639
you're something
of a ward to him?

46:52.475 --> 46:54.191
A friend, I like to think,

46:54.227 --> 46:56.110
who cares a great deal
for his welfare.

46:56.696 --> 47:00.147
Sounds like a warning.
Do you disapprove?

47:00.149 --> 47:03.284
- Would it matter if I did?
- But of course.

47:04.320 --> 47:06.737
I hope to be welcome
in your life, Vanessa.

47:07.740 --> 47:08.822
Then perhaps you should come

47:08.874 --> 47:10.291
and visit us
at Grandage Place?

47:12.461 --> 47:13.544
In time.

47:49.915 --> 47:51.699
I need you to chain me here.

48:11.721 --> 48:14.054
Now I need you
to sit over there.

48:23.199 --> 48:24.665
Whatever happens...

48:26.002 --> 48:27.601
do not move from that chair.

48:29.205 --> 48:30.404
All right?

48:34.310 --> 48:35.976
And what am I to do?

48:37.079 --> 48:38.245
Watch.

48:45.338 --> 48:48.322
You're so gorgeous.

48:51.927 --> 48:53.510
You'll feel better
in the morning.

48:54.263 --> 48:57.064
Come here! Do not
embarrass me like this!

48:59.352 --> 49:00.901
Miss Ives.

49:04.523 --> 49:06.490
A dizzying panorama, isn't it?

49:08.861 --> 49:10.994
All the toys of love
out of the box

49:11.030 --> 49:12.946
and scattered
around the floor.

49:12.998 --> 49:15.616
And at the end of the night
to be put carefully away.

49:17.169 --> 49:18.752
These terrible games.

49:18.788 --> 49:20.287
And do you ever play...

49:21.707 --> 49:23.557
or only spectate?

49:23.592 --> 49:25.125
I never learned the rules.

49:25.177 --> 49:26.593
Ah.

49:26.629 --> 49:29.129
The "complications",
as Doctor Frankenstein said to me.

49:29.181 --> 49:31.065
Like the workings in a watch.

49:34.970 --> 49:36.103
My dear Miss Ives,

49:36.138 --> 49:37.554
will you let me
escort you home?

49:37.640 --> 49:39.440
This place isn't safe for you.

49:39.475 --> 49:40.524
Safe?

49:41.644 --> 49:44.311
There are too many
complications.

49:44.363 --> 49:46.280
And you don't know the rules.

49:46.315 --> 49:49.450
- Do you, Mr. Lyle?
- I thought I did.

49:51.036 --> 49:53.120
But the stakes are too high.

49:53.155 --> 49:55.322
Let me escort you home,
please.

49:56.909 --> 49:58.659
Let me say good night
to the doctor.

49:58.661 --> 50:00.728
I'll be right back.
And thank you.

50:03.165 --> 50:04.415
It's not every night I leave

50:04.467 --> 50:07.084
with the most beautiful woman
in London on my arm.

50:09.004 --> 50:11.105
We won't be able to do it
again, will we? Will we?

52:15.965 --> 52:18.265
Miss Ives. Miss Ives.

52:18.300 --> 52:20.050
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

52:20.102 --> 52:21.301
Miss Ives.
