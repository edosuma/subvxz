WEBVTT

01:19.048 --> 01:20.705
You found me.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.174
Be still.

01:49.007 --> 01:49.963
I'm a doctor.

02:26.530 --> 02:27.363
Ugh!

02:28.416 --> 02:29.249
You won't be able to move

02:29.249 --> 02:30.333
about for a few days.

02:34.364 --> 02:36.520
- You, you're-

02:36.520 --> 02:38.470
You're damn lucky I found you.

02:41.303 --> 02:42.954
For a moment...

02:48.403 --> 02:51.236
Her hair is darker, twice as long.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.653
Most of your things were burned.

03:00.170 --> 03:01.420
Found these clothes here.

03:04.070 --> 03:05.383
How did you find me?

03:11.550 --> 03:15.640
- That saddled horse
running loose, followed

03:15.640 --> 03:17.090
her tracks back to your camp.

03:25.468 --> 03:26.551
Who did this?

03:29.106 --> 03:30.033
Apache.

03:43.383 --> 03:44.600
That wound needs cleaning.

03:44.600 --> 03:45.750
Let me do it.

03:48.600 --> 03:49.733
I practice medicine.

03:50.950 --> 03:51.783
I know.

03:56.871 --> 03:58.788
You told me last night.

04:03.830 --> 04:06.113
Thank you for saving my life.

04:10.710 --> 04:14.838
Rest, you might die if you don't.

05:29.866 --> 05:30.699
Oh.

05:52.723 --> 05:57.599
No.

05:57.599 --> 05:59.265
Jack!

06:30.247 --> 06:34.197
Jack.

06:49.230 --> 06:50.063
You let it die.

06:51.180 --> 06:53.844
Uh, there's an Indian down at camp.

06:55.557 --> 06:56.973
I think, he might be an Apache.

06:59.947 --> 07:01.150
Sounds to me like it's the first time

07:01.150 --> 07:02.083
you ever seen one.

07:03.315 --> 07:05.450
He might still be down there.

07:05.450 --> 07:07.853
- Well, even if he is,
he don't mean no harm.

07:10.800 --> 07:12.400
If Apaches would've done this,

07:14.062 --> 07:16.047
they'd have taken that scalp.

07:18.090 --> 07:20.943
They don't see red hair very often.

07:31.440 --> 07:32.440
It's for your wound.

07:33.860 --> 07:35.013
You won't let me do it.

07:50.950 --> 07:52.487
Gee.

07:52.487 --> 07:54.332
It's all I could catch.

08:11.632 --> 08:12.465
Ugh.

08:14.150 --> 08:15.873
There's another storm coming in.

08:17.030 --> 08:17.883
Don't look.

08:19.860 --> 08:21.860
Rain will soften up the ground.

08:23.290 --> 08:25.240
We'll bury your friends in the morning.

08:25.240 --> 08:26.733
They weren't my friends.

08:29.260 --> 08:31.150
Well, who were they?

08:31.150 --> 08:34.503
Just some party traveling west.

08:35.560 --> 08:36.643
I barely knew them.

08:42.562 --> 08:43.395
Well, I guess,

08:43.395 --> 08:45.210
their lives don't really matter then.

08:47.700 --> 08:50.153
Anyway, I ain't heading west.

08:51.991 --> 08:54.683
I'm heading north, the basin.

08:55.790 --> 08:57.333
There ain't nothing up there.

09:01.120 --> 09:02.570
Well, go your own way then.

09:03.713 --> 09:05.063
It don't matter none to me.

09:09.447 --> 09:13.814
Mm.

09:23.690 --> 09:24.523
This woman,

09:28.520 --> 09:30.093
the one you mistook me for,

09:33.820 --> 09:35.520
how long you been looking for her?

09:38.383 --> 09:39.253
A while.

09:46.677 --> 09:48.180
Is she your wife?

09:48.180 --> 09:49.363
Talk about her again,

09:50.560 --> 09:52.313
I'll finish the job they started.

09:57.109 --> 09:59.980
So, I'm leaving in the morning.

09:59.980 --> 10:01.730
As soon as those bodies are buried.

10:21.530 --> 10:23.570
Mm, Gail.

10:23.570 --> 10:26.993
Okay, it's won't be long.

10:26.993 --> 10:28.882
It won't be long now.

10:32.112 --> 10:34.280
It won't be long now.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.813
No, it won't be long.

11:03.370 --> 11:06.500
Don't touch me ever!

11:07.333 --> 11:08.166
Shoot me.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.610
I know what it's like to be touched

11:10.610 --> 11:12.339
when you don't want it.

11:18.230 --> 11:21.336
Just stay away from me.

12:08.418 --> 12:10.418
The horses are ready.

12:11.590 --> 12:12.829
You ought be resting.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.123
Here, I can help.

12:30.610 --> 12:32.260
Once you've seen enough of 'em,

12:33.955 --> 12:35.309
it ain't nothing.

12:40.530 --> 12:42.480
Do you think we should pray for them?

12:47.540 --> 12:49.190
We ought be getting on our way.

12:50.390 --> 12:51.863
We won't get very far today.

12:59.340 --> 13:00.183
Got any kin?

13:04.620 --> 13:09.090
No, none to speak of.

13:09.090 --> 13:10.660
So, neither of these men

13:10.660 --> 13:11.720
was your husband?

13:15.163 --> 13:16.673
I had a husband once.

13:22.270 --> 13:23.420
It was a long time ago.

13:28.820 --> 13:30.260
We ought to say something for them.

13:37.340 --> 13:39.099
Be my guest.

14:53.990 --> 14:56.481
We can get another hour,
or two out of the day.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.890
You're just gonna have to ride harder

15:09.890 --> 15:10.993
and longer tomorrow.

15:12.250 --> 15:16.493
- I will.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.800
I'll gather some wood.

16:50.130 --> 16:52.110
Those leaves you gave me,

16:52.110 --> 16:55.885
they aren't ordinary medicine are they?

17:00.920 --> 17:02.170
Where did you learn that?

17:06.400 --> 17:07.820
I was taught to use them,

17:10.260 --> 17:11.270
along with a lot of other things

17:11.270 --> 17:12.570
you don't learn in school.

17:14.760 --> 17:15.827
By an Indian?

17:24.090 --> 17:25.340
Jack?

17:25.340 --> 17:26.640
How do you know my name?

17:28.560 --> 17:31.072
You said it in your sleep.

17:35.980 --> 17:39.040
- Well, if you're
gonna call me anything,

17:39.040 --> 17:40.093
make it Travers.

17:42.300 --> 17:43.700
And you can call me Sarah.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.566
Once we get to Payston,

17:46.566 --> 17:47.493
it won't matter none.

17:48.890 --> 17:52.784
I'll go on my way and you'll go on yours.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.330
Do you think we'll have enough food

18:00.330 --> 18:01.193
to get us there?

18:02.310 --> 18:04.420
A man can live a long time

18:04.420 --> 18:05.270
without any food.

18:09.200 --> 18:11.680
- I'll catch
a fish in the morning.

18:11.680 --> 18:12.893
You can catch a fish?

18:14.010 --> 18:16.853
Yes, I've done so many a time before.

18:18.402 --> 18:20.340
My wife...

18:29.470 --> 18:31.820
I tried to teach her,
but she never took to it.

18:34.416 --> 18:35.824
I learned.

18:45.580 --> 18:47.030
I'll show you in the morning.

19:33.074 --> 19:33.907
Mm.

19:42.930 --> 19:44.446
Morning.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.220
I'll go catch us another fish,

19:55.220 --> 19:56.730
there ain't much here.

19:56.730 --> 19:58.030
No need for that.

19:59.521 --> 20:02.319
The boys and I already had our breakfast.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.503
Much obliged for the coffee.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.633
It sure does taste good, Ma'am.

20:11.430 --> 20:13.373
Delicious, did you make it yourself?

20:16.725 --> 20:18.675
Is she your wife? Your misses?

20:21.560 --> 20:22.916
Yeah.

20:27.853 --> 20:29.653
We'll be moving along soon.

20:32.860 --> 20:34.210
Which way is that?

20:38.520 --> 20:40.600
Most people head west.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.750
- Rube, you
ain't wrong about that.

20:44.706 --> 20:46.780
The best way around these mountains

20:46.780 --> 20:48.003
is that direction.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.520
I know where I'm going.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.550
You've been around these parts.

20:53.550 --> 20:54.383
Plenty.

20:55.270 --> 20:58.993
Funny, I never seen you before,

21:00.150 --> 21:04.083
but I seen you a time or two,

21:07.040 --> 21:08.593
must have been up in Payson.

21:10.130 --> 21:13.503
- I was up around Payson
a couple of nights ago.

21:15.610 --> 21:17.073
You boys trappers?

21:18.380 --> 21:19.980
We're looking for gold.

21:21.952 --> 21:22.810
It ain't always the mountains

21:22.810 --> 21:25.363
we're mining in.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.510
That's right, we're miners.

21:28.510 --> 21:30.696
You gonna eat that fish, missy?

21:31.529 --> 21:34.343
Timmy, now that ain't proper.

21:36.950 --> 21:38.793
You gotta ask her like she's a lady.

21:40.081 --> 21:41.128
- Oh, what's it,
I'm not hungry anyhow.

21:43.020 --> 21:47.610
Ma'am, the best eating is what you catch

21:47.610 --> 21:50.370
with your own bare hands.

21:51.203 --> 21:52.816
Jack, I think, it's time

21:52.816 --> 21:55.426
we should go, shouldn't we?

21:56.530 --> 21:57.983
You're right about that.

22:01.270 --> 22:02.970
Much obliged for the conversation.

22:06.550 --> 22:09.000
- You know, we ain't been
up that way in a while.

22:10.270 --> 22:11.420
We'll keep you company.

22:14.010 --> 22:14.983
If you don't mind.

23:00.849 --> 23:02.579
Ugh!

23:09.680 --> 23:12.298
She's doing the cooking in the morning.

23:12.298 --> 23:14.993
Ugh, Timmy, this here's a lady.

23:16.180 --> 23:17.013
Ain't ya?

23:22.730 --> 23:23.913
She may be.

23:26.060 --> 23:27.560
I'll wager this woman's seen

23:27.560 --> 23:30.913
her fair share of hard work.

23:32.050 --> 23:33.450
She's been wounded.

23:34.670 --> 23:35.793
Is that so?

23:37.310 --> 23:39.517
She looks alright to me.

23:45.460 --> 23:49.899
Someone cut her.

23:53.990 --> 23:54.893
I feel better.

23:56.410 --> 23:58.210
I'll fetch some wood in the morning.

24:00.340 --> 24:02.799
And you'll kill us something to eat.

24:02.799 --> 24:07.787
- I ain't much for
hunting, animals anyhow.

24:10.380 --> 24:14.180
I heard you two talking about Apaches

24:16.030 --> 24:17.003
on the trail.

24:19.130 --> 24:21.063
I run into some a while back,

24:23.870 --> 24:25.313
a few years ago.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.340
They just about took my head.

24:37.860 --> 24:40.343
But I wasn't feeling so generous that day.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.000
Surprised they didn't take

24:43.000 --> 24:46.271
your scarlet mane there, missy.

24:58.490 --> 24:59.370
There's worse things

24:59.370 --> 25:01.013
in these mountains than Apaches.

25:04.380 --> 25:08.750
Oh, yeah? You've seen these things.

25:08.750 --> 25:09.600
I've been them.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.090
I'll take first watch.

25:18.090 --> 25:21.003
Nah, you get some rest.

25:22.390 --> 25:24.460
You're gonna need it tomorrow.

25:28.480 --> 25:29.930
Go on, go and have a sleep.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.695
When he does, his eyes are half open.

25:56.426 --> 26:00.833
- If I don't do this,
he'll try to lay with you.

26:04.431 --> 26:05.643
He already has.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.564
I know.

26:18.050 --> 26:19.540
Tell me what happened.

26:27.860 --> 26:28.693
Sarah?

26:38.793 --> 26:40.509
The horses.

26:45.652 --> 26:47.826
They were stuck in the mud.

26:51.920 --> 26:56.920
Billy, he knew that if we didn't get 'em,

27:03.051 --> 27:05.468
there'd be hell when it died,

27:09.963 --> 27:11.863
but the team wouldn't move.

27:17.540 --> 27:19.640
And then, these men came along

27:22.590 --> 27:24.340
and they drove them out of the mud.

27:28.650 --> 27:29.853
We were so grateful.

27:35.510 --> 27:36.923
Mary and I made dinner.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.823
All the men told stories.

27:44.558 --> 27:47.725
We went to bed like every other night.

27:53.377 --> 27:54.377
And when we woke up,

27:56.392 --> 27:57.863
there were guns in her faces.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.433
He shot Martin first,

28:08.050 --> 28:09.750
for no reason that I can think of.

28:11.140 --> 28:13.364
He was just standing there.

28:17.250 --> 28:18.960
I think, they wanted us to know

28:18.960 --> 28:21.022
how bad they were.

28:25.383 --> 28:27.050
Then they took Mary.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.643
Billy tried to stop him and they shot him.

28:34.760 --> 28:35.910
And then, they took me,

28:38.497 --> 28:39.330
and they took me in the wagon-

28:39.330 --> 28:43.453
That's enough. That's enough.

28:46.030 --> 28:47.860
Why did you want to know?

28:53.592 --> 28:58.592
- Because in the morning,
I'm gonna kill 'em all.

29:11.395 --> 29:16.168
Are you cold?

29:16.168 --> 29:17.001
No.

29:21.746 --> 29:24.829
Not anymore.

30:47.230 --> 30:50.630
I guess, I was too much of a gentleman

30:51.730 --> 30:52.643
the other night.

30:55.430 --> 30:57.190
I sure didn't think
you'd be crawling outta

30:57.190 --> 30:58.363
that wagon alive.

31:02.900 --> 31:07.900
I have to admit Missy,
you defy my expectations.

31:11.352 --> 31:12.703
Ugh! Uh, uh.

31:15.775 --> 31:17.608
Uh, you fucking whore!

31:19.355 --> 31:20.855
Ugh, ugh, uh, ugh!

31:54.933 --> 31:56.766
Where is he?

31:57.618 --> 31:58.715
Where is he?

32:04.008 --> 32:05.425
Where is he gone?

32:08.210 --> 32:11.009
He shot Rube when he
was trying to get away.

32:30.600 --> 32:31.500
Are you injured?

32:32.985 --> 32:33.818
No.

32:35.740 --> 32:37.520
Is he dead?

33:01.020 --> 33:01.853
Take it.

33:04.580 --> 33:05.413
I said, take it!

33:10.270 --> 33:12.550
Kill him for what he did to you.

33:12.550 --> 33:13.625
No.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.453
He fucked you and left you for dead!

33:22.485 --> 33:23.505
He's getting away.

33:24.550 --> 33:25.678
Finish him!

33:28.115 --> 33:30.015
Please, Jack!

33:30.015 --> 33:32.900
I told you not to call me that.

33:33.899 --> 33:35.466
She called me that.

33:36.299 --> 33:39.105
Listen to me, please.

33:42.407 --> 33:43.490
Stop! Please!

33:46.820 --> 33:48.558
You're on your own!

36:03.930 --> 36:05.290
Jack?

36:05.290 --> 36:06.363
No one's called me

36:06.363 --> 36:07.971
that since I was a boy.

36:09.960 --> 36:14.606
Sergeant, let's get this
woman something to eat.

36:27.042 --> 36:28.120
How'd you get lost all

36:28.120 --> 36:28.993
the way out here?

36:31.140 --> 36:33.040
My traveling companions were killed.

36:34.650 --> 36:35.560
I suppose, that might be

36:35.560 --> 36:38.310
the bodies buried a couple days past,

36:38.310 --> 36:39.610
a few miles north of here.

36:42.227 --> 36:43.690
I don't guess you know anything about

36:43.690 --> 36:44.940
the two that were buried?

36:46.010 --> 36:47.450
From out south, I'd say

36:47.450 --> 36:50.230
they were killed sometime
yesterday morning.

36:50.230 --> 36:52.080
Mr. White's our tracker.

36:55.557 --> 36:56.757
I've been alone since.

36:58.280 --> 36:59.393
I haven't seen anyone.

37:00.608 --> 37:01.441
Ma'am.

37:01.441 --> 37:02.274
Watch obliged.

37:04.600 --> 37:06.427
That ain't much,

37:06.427 --> 37:07.983
but it ought to fill you up some.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.040
Now, can you recall how many were

37:11.040 --> 37:12.090
in that rating party?

37:14.970 --> 37:19.223
Maybe 10, maybe a dozen.

37:20.450 --> 37:22.287
That many?

37:22.287 --> 37:23.600
Well, that'd be the biggest pack

37:23.600 --> 37:24.763
we've tracked this far.

37:27.450 --> 37:28.650
He might be with them.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.410
He might be.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.233
He?

37:34.200 --> 37:35.150
Deserter.

37:36.400 --> 37:38.350
We've been chasing him a few years now.

37:40.540 --> 37:41.640
You have.

37:48.090 --> 37:50.190
We'll take these savages back to the fort.

37:52.590 --> 37:53.840
I have to go to Payson.

37:56.160 --> 37:57.263
With respect, Ma'am,

37:59.230 --> 38:01.970
you'll die out here just as you would've

38:01.970 --> 38:03.170
if we hadn't come along.

38:08.712 --> 38:09.700
I don't think you understand

38:09.700 --> 38:11.373
how lucky you've been this far.

38:14.120 --> 38:14.953
Soldiers!

38:36.460 --> 38:38.692
These Apache have no creed.

38:40.350 --> 38:41.800
They have no God to speak of.

38:45.135 --> 38:47.135
They just as soon kill a woman as a man,

38:49.105 --> 38:51.105
or cut down a child, or slaughter a hog.

39:05.945 --> 39:07.897
You see any decency in his eyes?

39:15.960 --> 39:19.123
Ma'am, when God created this world,

39:20.810 --> 39:21.910
he made man and woman.

39:23.703 --> 39:24.803
He gave us the animals

39:27.098 --> 39:28.570
and then, he made the Apache

39:31.070 --> 39:32.703
to be a thorn in our side,

39:34.770 --> 39:36.670
to be wiped off the face of the earth.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.220
Now, when you're finished eating,

39:54.220 --> 39:55.053
you can gather your things-

39:55.053 --> 39:55.930
I will take her.

40:00.650 --> 40:02.740
I'll return when she's been delivered,

40:02.740 --> 40:04.130
should only be a day's delay,

40:04.130 --> 40:05.300
and the road between here

40:05.300 --> 40:07.560
and there will have been scouted.

40:07.560 --> 40:09.323
Sergeant, you have your prisoners.

40:10.560 --> 40:11.680
I'm sure you'll be credited

40:11.680 --> 40:13.730
for this accomplishment back at the fort.

40:17.140 --> 40:20.233
- So be it.

40:21.790 --> 40:22.623
On up!

40:25.840 --> 40:29.583
God speed, Ma'am, I
fear you shall need it.

40:31.760 --> 40:32.593
Mr. White.

40:33.740 --> 40:34.573
Sergeant.

40:51.530 --> 40:53.793
- How long have you been
tracking for the army?

40:55.320 --> 40:57.370
Long enough to have known your husband.

40:58.920 --> 40:59.930
Though, I never had the honor

40:59.930 --> 41:01.563
to meet you, it as war time.

41:04.070 --> 41:06.110
I heard about you, though

41:06.110 --> 41:08.203
after his so dishonorable conduct.

41:13.230 --> 41:14.880
Don't look so surprised, Abigail,

41:16.180 --> 41:19.027
the reputation of your
beauty proceeds you.

41:20.880 --> 41:23.130
Though, I didn't expect
to see so many scars.

41:24.930 --> 41:26.130
Did he give them to you?

41:37.560 --> 41:40.423
You've seen him, haven't you?

41:42.786 --> 41:44.740
You already know the answer to that.

41:44.740 --> 41:46.838
And he's gone to Payson.

41:51.410 --> 41:52.960
I don't know where he's gone.

41:55.545 --> 41:58.560
How long have you been looking for him?

41:58.560 --> 42:01.533
Since you left him, and he deserted.

42:03.360 --> 42:05.240
I have no tolerance for deserters.

42:05.240 --> 42:06.603
They only belong one place,

42:07.920 --> 42:09.143
at the end of a rope.

42:12.170 --> 42:14.420
I must say, I'm surprised
he didn't kill you.

42:16.900 --> 42:19.563
He promised that he
would the day he left us.

42:24.120 --> 42:24.953
We better get going

42:24.953 --> 42:26.590
if we wanna make Payson before dark.

43:03.320 --> 43:04.346
I expect

43:04.346 --> 43:05.250
you'll be wanting a room.

43:05.250 --> 43:06.130
Yes, Ma'am.

43:06.130 --> 43:06.963
Well, I've got two

43:06.963 --> 43:08.440
and neither is currently taken.

43:12.220 --> 43:14.093
We don't allow her kind in here.

43:15.490 --> 43:17.560
This is a respectable establishment.

43:17.560 --> 43:19.260
If that's what you've got in mind,

43:19.260 --> 43:21.210
there's a place for it down the street.

43:22.110 --> 43:23.330
Ma'am, I have no knowledge

43:23.330 --> 43:24.680
of what you're insinuating.

43:26.320 --> 43:29.003
This lady's in my custody,
I'm a military escort.

43:30.640 --> 43:32.423
The room is for her and her alone.

43:35.290 --> 43:36.190
- Well,
I guess, I'll just have

43:36.190 --> 43:37.440
to take your word for it.

44:04.290 --> 44:06.340
I didn't know you had a sordid history.

44:20.327 --> 44:21.630
You must have turned to those ways

44:21.630 --> 44:22.593
after you left him.

44:24.825 --> 44:26.260
I don't think even Travers would marry

44:26.260 --> 44:27.093
a woman who...

44:30.210 --> 44:33.420
Anyhow, he's as responsible

44:33.420 --> 44:34.970
for your corruption as you are.

44:36.950 --> 44:38.170
I hope to find him and put an end

44:38.170 --> 44:39.313
to this wicked mess.

44:41.810 --> 44:43.610
I'm sure he has already left here.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.210
Don't leave this room till morning.

44:50.210 --> 44:51.380
The stage will be in, and I'll make sure

44:51.380 --> 44:52.213
you're on it.

44:56.220 --> 44:57.060
You have a chance

44:57.060 --> 45:00.793
at redemption, Abigail, take it.

45:56.040 --> 45:59.473
Miss Scarlet! What's wrong?

46:00.828 --> 46:03.470
Oh, Miss Scarlet, I've missed you.

46:03.470 --> 46:06.530
Come on, gimme one of your sweet kisses.

46:06.530 --> 46:07.480
Be quiet.

46:07.480 --> 46:08.530
Oh, you don't give a damn?

46:08.530 --> 46:09.653
I said, shut up!

46:11.337 --> 46:14.283
- You're not Scarlet,
not all cut up like that.

46:16.900 --> 46:18.960
She probably ran off with that fella.

46:18.960 --> 46:19.793
Who?

46:20.890 --> 46:24.460
Some guy was looking for her.

46:24.460 --> 46:26.398
What guy was looking for her?

46:28.330 --> 46:30.110
I'm not too picky.

46:30.110 --> 46:31.870
You look good in my book.

46:31.870 --> 46:34.821
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

46:46.982 --> 46:51.482
Hey, come on, the hooch .

47:05.034 --> 47:06.858
for money, right, honey?

47:06.858 --> 47:07.691
Yeah.

47:07.691 --> 47:09.078
Oh, yeah.

47:10.970 --> 47:13.143
- What do you know about
the man playing poker?

47:17.570 --> 47:19.270
He was looking for Miss Scarlet,

47:20.160 --> 47:21.143
but I found her.

47:22.077 --> 47:22.910
- I'm busy right now-

47:22.910 --> 47:24.220
How long has he been here?

47:25.154 --> 47:26.949
Well, what are you?

47:28.615 --> 47:29.448
Let's have a drink.

47:29.448 --> 47:30.281
What did he say?

47:31.457 --> 47:33.498
Don't yell, nothing like that.

47:35.750 --> 47:36.900
He was looking for you.

47:39.340 --> 47:42.713
He said you was his wife,
but you wasn't here.

47:44.933 --> 47:45.933
He went to drinking.

47:47.370 --> 47:49.233
I guess, he's got a new wife.

47:50.340 --> 47:53.733
Marky, a little elixir of life, please?

47:55.440 --> 47:56.560
If you wanna take his clothes off,

47:56.560 --> 47:59.186
why don't you take him upstairs?

48:01.300 --> 48:03.810
By the looks of it, he's winning,

48:03.810 --> 48:05.610
and we ain't got no reason to leave.

48:08.650 --> 48:10.181
Call.

48:12.432 --> 48:14.028
- I'm busy right now-

48:15.640 --> 48:17.520
- This table's for
gambling, not for whoring.

48:17.520 --> 48:19.963
I'm sick and tired of
you confusing the two.

48:20.930 --> 48:23.080
- Maybe if you pay
attention to your cards,

48:24.180 --> 48:25.673
you might win for a change.

48:26.580 --> 48:28.694
Shut your cunt mouth.

48:29.950 --> 48:31.564
Say it to her again.

48:36.150 --> 48:37.350
We'll play another game,

48:38.940 --> 48:41.043
which you're also likely to lose.

48:46.370 --> 48:47.348
Ugh!

48:47.348 --> 48:48.287
Ugh!

48:48.287 --> 48:49.269
Uh!

48:55.578 --> 48:56.411
Ya!

48:56.411 --> 48:57.994
Ugh.

48:57.994 --> 48:59.383
Ya.

48:59.383 --> 49:00.216
Ugh!

49:00.216 --> 49:01.049
Uh.

49:04.317 --> 49:05.567
Jack!

49:11.520 --> 49:14.050
- I didn't think you'd
come looking for me.

49:14.050 --> 49:15.740
I have something to tell you.

49:15.740 --> 49:18.210
Why, girl, it looks like

49:18.210 --> 49:21.200
you've come home to Papa.

49:21.200 --> 49:23.053
I knew you couldn't stay away,

49:24.150 --> 49:25.523
this is where you belong.

49:26.740 --> 49:29.653
Come on, honey. I'll clean you up.

49:31.490 --> 49:32.690
Make you feel real good.

49:34.964 --> 49:36.714
You sure did earn some good loving.

49:42.410 --> 49:45.733
- Let me buy you one and
we can talk business.

50:13.990 --> 50:17.353
- Whisky, a
tall one and a small one.

50:19.010 --> 50:20.507
Didn't I warn you about-

50:20.507 --> 50:23.900
- Hey! I'm supposed to
buy this lady a drink.

50:23.900 --> 50:24.973
Go right ahead.

50:26.050 --> 50:27.425
That ain't enough.

50:30.540 --> 50:33.066
Better be moving along.

50:35.331 --> 50:39.460
As I was saying, I warned you not

50:39.460 --> 50:41.030
to go out on your own, babe,

50:41.030 --> 50:42.540
and look what happened to you.

50:42.540 --> 50:44.827
Got all cut up, didn't you?

50:45.663 --> 50:47.150
Huh, you didn't listen to me

50:47.150 --> 50:49.158
and you paid the price.

50:49.991 --> 50:54.070
But out of the generosity of my heart,

50:54.070 --> 50:55.874
I'll take you back.

50:56.707 --> 50:59.480
Of course, you'll have
to take a cut in pay,

50:59.480 --> 51:00.920
seeing as how you don't look

51:00.920 --> 51:05.340
as good as you used to, and we'll have

51:05.340 --> 51:08.010
to get you out of this
garbage into something

51:08.010 --> 51:09.880
a little bit more fitting.

51:09.880 --> 51:13.703
Hey! Look what I found.

51:15.020 --> 51:20.020
- Men, buy this gentleman
a drink on the house.

51:25.060 --> 51:27.875
All right, pop, let's go.

51:35.040 --> 51:38.659
To us, back in business.

51:41.700 --> 51:43.613
You know, I'm all yours, Jack.

51:45.130 --> 51:46.480
Why did you call me that?

51:47.523 --> 51:49.433
Well, I don't know, she did.

51:53.260 --> 51:56.326
- You can have as much
of me as you'd like.

51:57.414 --> 52:00.928
Just leave me alone.

52:00.928 --> 52:02.963
Awe, I didn't mean to upset you,

52:04.380 --> 52:05.969
let me make you feel better.

52:05.969 --> 52:08.703
I said, leave me alone.

52:10.920 --> 52:12.163
But this is my room.

52:15.670 --> 52:18.498
Take the money and get outta here.

52:24.230 --> 52:26.910
I'll be around if you need me.

52:32.993 --> 52:33.826
Sarah.

52:39.930 --> 52:42.800
I told you to leave me...

52:48.170 --> 52:51.633
Go ahead, I'm ready.

52:53.370 --> 52:54.970
Oh, you're not ready for this.

52:58.531 --> 52:59.410
Ugh!

52:59.410 --> 53:01.320
What do you say, babe?

53:01.320 --> 53:03.406
You can start tonight if you like.

53:04.239 --> 53:05.880
I'll be your first customer.

53:05.880 --> 53:07.680
I won't work for you McCabe.

53:07.680 --> 53:09.924
Not tonight, not ever.

53:11.330 --> 53:13.570
After all I've done for you?

53:13.570 --> 53:14.560
Taking you out of that-

53:14.560 --> 53:18.533
Yes! You did and I was grateful.

53:20.010 --> 53:22.980
So grateful that I gave you five years

53:22.980 --> 53:24.308
of my life.

53:26.081 --> 53:27.970
And I paid you back.

53:27.970 --> 53:29.980
And then I gave you a couple more

53:29.980 --> 53:31.576
just to get on my feet.

53:32.409 --> 53:34.203
So, I don't owe you a damn thing, McCabe.

53:41.240 --> 53:43.010
Finish yours and get out

53:43.010 --> 53:46.423
of my town, don't come back.

53:47.480 --> 53:49.900
Even if you ever come to realize

53:49.900 --> 53:51.567
what you are good for.

53:56.260 --> 53:57.699
Hello, Sarah.

53:59.870 --> 54:01.950
You can have your man back.

54:01.950 --> 54:03.603
I sure did wear him out for you.

54:07.313 --> 54:08.680
Ugh!

54:08.680 --> 54:11.767
She took my hand, so now,
I'm gonna take yours.

54:12.811 --> 54:14.060
Ugh!

54:23.135 --> 54:24.181
Hold it!

54:25.430 --> 54:27.359
Lay the shotgun on the bed.

54:29.180 --> 54:31.493
That's the man I want, not you.

54:39.589 --> 54:41.856
Uh, ugh, uh.

54:47.095 --> 54:48.345
Yeah, ugh, ugh.

54:52.650 --> 54:54.270
- Sure you
won't spend the night?

54:55.220 --> 54:57.290
I can lock him up in the jailhouse.

54:57.290 --> 54:59.260
My wife can make you a bed.

55:00.093 --> 55:01.900
I appreciate the hospitality,

55:01.900 --> 55:02.733
but I should get started.

55:02.733 --> 55:05.127
They're expecting us back at the fort.

55:05.127 --> 55:06.683
He may bleed out overnight.

55:07.560 --> 55:09.509
You won't, will you, Doc?

55:10.610 --> 55:12.860
That isn't the rightful
death for a deserter.

55:40.205 --> 55:41.664
Ugh!

55:43.683 --> 55:44.516
Hold it!

55:46.640 --> 55:47.731
Hold it, or I'll shoot!

55:49.249 --> 55:50.082
Let's go.

56:01.586 --> 56:02.880
Ugh.

56:02.880 --> 56:03.713
Jack?

56:06.615 --> 56:07.782
Ugh, uh, uh.

56:09.100 --> 56:10.683
You've been shot.

56:11.810 --> 56:14.977
Oh, don't stop, they're coming, uh.

56:16.100 --> 56:17.431
- We have to.
- Uh.

56:17.431 --> 56:19.172
You're not gonna make it to the morning.

56:20.563 --> 56:22.031
Just leave me.

56:25.020 --> 56:28.808
But just for a moment, wait here.

56:28.808 --> 56:29.641
Uh, ugh.

56:39.421 --> 56:40.773
I didn't mean to frighten you.

56:45.980 --> 56:47.233
My friend's been hurt.

56:49.070 --> 56:51.240
We need a place to stay tonight.

56:53.100 --> 56:55.154
We won't hurt you, I promise.

56:58.920 --> 57:00.170
She can't hear no more.

57:02.370 --> 57:07.370
She's my eyes and I'm her ears.

57:10.060 --> 57:11.083
Where's your friend?

57:12.140 --> 57:13.340
He's down in the wash.

57:14.920 --> 57:15.893
He's been shot.

57:20.770 --> 57:21.603
There's a town

57:21.603 --> 57:22.573
not far from here.

57:23.550 --> 57:25.160
You should go there.

57:25.160 --> 57:26.932
We just came from there.

57:28.890 --> 57:29.723
Our place,

57:29.723 --> 57:31.670
the only place for miles around.

57:31.670 --> 57:33.070
They'll come here, you know?

57:41.200 --> 57:45.810
There's a place around these parts,

57:45.810 --> 57:48.213
it's often want for a
need of a place to hide.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.684
She'll show you.

57:59.233 --> 58:00.400
Ugh, uh, uh.

58:04.409 --> 58:05.326
Uh, uh, uh.

58:17.770 --> 58:18.603
Ugh, ooh!

58:22.570 --> 58:23.912
They're coming.

58:23.912 --> 58:24.783
Ugh.

58:24.783 --> 58:27.802
- Ssh! You're gonna
have to keep him quiet.

58:29.321 --> 58:30.443
I'll make sure of it.

58:32.442 --> 58:34.650
They're coming up the wash.

58:34.650 --> 58:36.783
Gail, is that you?

58:36.783 --> 58:39.624
Ssh, ssh, ssh, you have to be quiet.

58:39.624 --> 58:40.939
Mm.

58:45.288 --> 58:46.967
What's happening here?

58:46.967 --> 58:48.477
Who are you?

58:48.477 --> 58:50.310
You know, we thought you was Apache

58:50.310 --> 58:51.665
and raiding us.

58:52.498 --> 58:54.040
- A man and a
woman came through here,

58:54.040 --> 58:55.590
have you seen them?

58:55.590 --> 58:56.660
Mr. I ain't seen a man,

58:56.660 --> 58:59.293
or a woman in 20 something years.

59:00.204 --> 59:02.285
And you?

59:02.285 --> 59:05.399
She can't hear.

59:05.399 --> 59:07.149
Is that so?

59:08.070 --> 59:09.492
Yes, Mr.

59:11.620 --> 59:12.587
Can't hear .

59:13.860 --> 59:15.020
Wait, they probably went into

59:15.020 --> 59:16.930
the hills west of here.

59:16.930 --> 59:18.392
That's good cover there.

59:19.320 --> 59:21.920
You say this woman is deaf?

59:21.920 --> 59:23.357
Yes, sir.

59:25.670 --> 59:27.270
Sure seems deaf to me.

59:29.260 --> 59:30.460
The man is a traitor

59:31.560 --> 59:33.060
and the woman not much better.

59:34.560 --> 59:36.570
If you see them, I expect you'll do right

59:36.570 --> 59:37.403
by the law.

59:52.941 --> 59:53.774
Ooh.

59:57.190 --> 59:59.273
Uh, I can't do it myself.

1:00:12.471 --> 1:00:13.304
Ugh!

1:00:19.934 --> 1:00:20.934
Uh, uh, ugh.

1:00:24.890 --> 1:00:26.294
Keep going.

1:00:26.294 --> 1:00:28.772
Uh, ugh.

1:00:28.772 --> 1:00:33.772
Oh, God!

1:00:35.659 --> 1:00:40.659
Ugh.

1:00:42.387 --> 1:00:43.220
Uh, uh.

1:00:49.071 --> 1:00:49.904
Uh.

1:00:51.960 --> 1:00:55.423
Burn it, burn it!

1:00:59.046 --> 1:01:00.722
God.

1:01:02.954 --> 1:01:03.787
Ugh!

1:01:31.450 --> 1:01:32.975
Thank you.

1:01:40.659 --> 1:01:43.159
The man that was chasing you

1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:47.423
is from the army.

1:01:52.070 --> 1:01:52.903
I know.

1:02:00.243 --> 1:02:02.193
He mistook me for your wife.

1:02:10.390 --> 1:02:11.693
He called me Abigail.

1:02:17.610 --> 1:02:18.833
I called her Gail.

1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:26.943
Like a strong wind.

1:03:33.893 --> 1:03:37.688
You best go west, the way they went.

1:03:40.982 --> 1:03:43.577
I've been that way before.

1:03:43.577 --> 1:03:44.410
I doubt they'll cover

1:03:44.410 --> 1:03:45.563
the same ground twice.

1:03:47.467 --> 1:03:48.670
My wife packed you some food

1:03:48.670 --> 1:03:52.516
for the trail, enough for a days ride.

1:03:53.349 --> 1:03:54.182
Two if you're prudent.

1:03:56.226 --> 1:03:57.309
I can't thank you enough

1:03:57.309 --> 1:03:58.142
for all that you've done.

1:04:01.406 --> 1:04:02.956
Like I said, it's all we got,

1:04:05.967 --> 1:04:07.173
but you're welcome to it.

1:04:16.930 --> 1:04:19.160
Why have you done all of this?

1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:20.410
I weren't always blind.

1:04:22.624 --> 1:04:24.474
I reckon If I'd had me a hiding spot,

1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:27.920
hell, I might not be here today.

1:04:29.430 --> 1:04:30.527
God, go with you.

1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:02.153
Is it White?

1:06:05.754 --> 1:06:06.587
No.

1:06:09.997 --> 1:06:11.249
Uh.

1:07:30.790 --> 1:07:31.623
Come.

1:07:56.270 --> 1:07:57.253
I know this man.

1:08:01.040 --> 1:08:01.943
Travers?

1:08:06.436 --> 1:08:07.350
How?

1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:15.093
He run like Apache.

1:09:18.750 --> 1:09:20.332
Why?

1:09:20.332 --> 1:09:25.332
Mm, a woman, she leave.

1:10:01.360 --> 1:10:02.193
He leave.

1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:13.215
He give life.

1:10:23.450 --> 1:10:27.453
He tell of a woman he want to find.

1:10:32.250 --> 1:10:35.663
Apache follow.

1:10:36.510 --> 1:10:37.883
Apache always sees.

1:10:39.692 --> 1:10:40.992
The Apache at the wagon.

1:10:45.060 --> 1:10:46.300
One day,

1:10:46.300 --> 1:10:50.498
he find woman, and Apache no follow.

1:10:54.790 --> 1:10:56.390
He's been looking a long time.

1:11:00.420 --> 1:11:01.303
He find her.

1:11:13.118 --> 1:11:14.368
He not see her.

1:11:16.060 --> 1:11:17.755
He not want to see.

1:11:22.170 --> 1:11:23.363
Why woman leave?

1:11:27.250 --> 1:11:28.900
She'll tell him when it's time.

1:11:32.270 --> 1:11:33.103
Some day.

1:11:39.460 --> 1:11:40.760
Will you take me to him?

1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:55.573
She's gone. She left that.

1:13:01.267 --> 1:13:03.300
You should be resting.

1:13:03.300 --> 1:13:04.323
I should be ready.

1:13:05.630 --> 1:13:07.085
For what?

1:13:13.030 --> 1:13:14.363
Who are you going to kill?

1:13:15.450 --> 1:13:17.485
Nobody with his hand.

1:13:19.150 --> 1:13:21.450
It doesn't seem to know
what to do with a gun.

1:13:24.403 --> 1:13:26.667
- I thought you were a
doctor once, weren't you?

1:13:28.654 --> 1:13:30.404
Where did you learn how to use one?

1:13:32.269 --> 1:13:33.173
It came natural.

1:13:36.570 --> 1:13:37.983
I followed my heart.

1:13:40.040 --> 1:13:42.053
It showed me the way.

1:13:48.956 --> 1:13:52.706
- I think, I
might know where she is.

1:13:54.670 --> 1:13:56.220
When I worked at the saloon...

1:13:58.940 --> 1:13:59.973
She was there too.

1:14:01.737 --> 1:14:03.270
A woman came through,

1:14:06.113 --> 1:14:08.380
it might have been her.

1:14:10.700 --> 1:14:12.530
She told me where she came from,

1:14:16.590 --> 1:14:19.098
maybe she went back there when she left.

1:14:21.990 --> 1:14:23.390
Do you know where this is?

1:14:32.230 --> 1:14:33.253
Take me there.

1:15:16.030 --> 1:15:18.293
What are these men doing here?

1:15:21.770 --> 1:15:23.603
This is where McCabe found me.

1:15:26.490 --> 1:15:28.633
He paid and took me to Payson.

1:15:30.173 --> 1:15:31.623
This is where my face was cut

1:15:33.958 --> 1:15:34.791
the first time.

1:15:41.410 --> 1:15:42.243
Shit.

1:15:44.770 --> 1:15:47.580
Stop, that's far enough.

1:15:47.580 --> 1:15:48.863
What you come here for?

1:15:51.100 --> 1:15:52.083
Found this woman.

1:15:53.580 --> 1:15:54.900
She said she was lost,

1:15:54.900 --> 1:15:58.403
but I figure maybe she ran off.

1:16:02.050 --> 1:16:02.883
Tanner!

1:16:17.430 --> 1:16:19.873
- That's quite
the assumption, traveler.

1:16:21.840 --> 1:16:24.290
What makes you think we
want a woman around here?

1:16:26.920 --> 1:16:28.770
Well, maybe I'm in the wrong place,

1:16:30.398 --> 1:16:31.620
but a fellow named McCabe told me

1:16:31.620 --> 1:16:32.603
to come this way.

1:16:34.550 --> 1:16:35.393
Did he now?

1:16:38.960 --> 1:16:40.903
She does look kind of familiar, boys.

1:16:44.490 --> 1:16:45.897
What you want for her?

1:16:47.290 --> 1:16:51.410
The going rate plus my turn

1:16:51.410 --> 1:16:53.530
with the best of your stock.

1:16:53.530 --> 1:16:54.780
The best, huh?

1:16:57.180 --> 1:17:02.180
Well, you best come take a look.

1:17:06.920 --> 1:17:08.713
Get down there and get 'em.

1:17:25.247 --> 1:17:26.080
You look real

1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:27.080
and real good, all right?

1:18:00.950 --> 1:18:03.026
- I'm not finding what
I'm looking for here.

1:18:03.859 --> 1:18:05.659
Well, take two of 'em if you want.

1:18:07.159 --> 1:18:10.327
- I'll just take her
and I'll be on my way.

1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:11.993
Hey?

1:18:14.490 --> 1:18:15.840
What happened to your hand?

1:18:22.780 --> 1:18:24.100
Bitch bit me while I was trying

1:18:24.100 --> 1:18:25.350
to hold her down.

1:18:25.350 --> 1:18:26.183
As I remember,

1:18:26.183 --> 1:18:29.786
she was a fighter one.

1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:40.720
Well, devil woman, welcome back to hell.

1:18:53.835 --> 1:18:54.996
Are you okay?

1:18:57.565 --> 1:18:58.565
Yeah, yes.

1:19:16.140 --> 1:19:17.190
He's not one of them.

1:19:20.600 --> 1:19:21.723
You came back.

1:19:23.850 --> 1:19:24.883
She's not here.

1:19:27.050 --> 1:19:28.350
Who are you looking for?

1:19:31.380 --> 1:19:34.293
My wife, Gail.

1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:37.393
Most of these women

1:19:37.393 --> 1:19:38.570
aren't from around here,

1:19:40.405 --> 1:19:41.455
but some of them are.

1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:47.336
I know another place she might be.

1:19:54.635 --> 1:19:56.738
Will you go home?

1:19:56.738 --> 1:19:57.815
Home.

1:20:05.650 --> 1:20:06.663
We'll find our way.

1:20:24.700 --> 1:20:25.683
Who is that man?

1:20:34.840 --> 1:20:38.113
At first light, I'm gonna go see him.

1:20:40.250 --> 1:20:41.950
You don't need to take your gun.

1:20:44.030 --> 1:20:45.480
That man will do you no harm.

1:21:10.230 --> 1:21:11.873
Do you know why she left?

1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:29.633
Here.

1:21:35.500 --> 1:21:37.017
Read it to me.

1:22:07.590 --> 1:22:10.180
Jack, when this reaches you,

1:22:14.350 --> 1:22:15.973
I will no longer be here,

1:22:18.300 --> 1:22:20.283
and I will no longer be your wife.

1:22:24.753 --> 1:22:25.840
I have found the telegram

1:22:25.840 --> 1:22:27.593
from the physician in Dallas.

1:22:34.150 --> 1:22:36.440
I know that it is not my body, but yours

1:22:36.440 --> 1:22:39.123
that hinders us from having a family.

1:22:48.650 --> 1:22:50.253
Why did you keep this from me?

1:22:54.210 --> 1:22:55.890
You know that I have spent these months

1:22:55.890 --> 1:22:57.540
at war with my own body

1:22:57.540 --> 1:22:59.173
wanting one little one with you.

1:23:01.140 --> 1:23:03.851
Now, I will leave you to your own war.

1:23:06.090 --> 1:23:08.373
Like the one that has
taken you away from me.

1:23:13.173 --> 1:23:14.130
I will no longer be without

1:23:14.130 --> 1:23:15.570
what I want so dearly

1:23:19.250 --> 1:23:21.550
and what with you, I have lived without.

1:23:25.763 --> 1:23:29.096
The love we once shared will be no more.

1:23:36.437 --> 1:23:38.520
It will only be memories.

1:23:43.700 --> 1:23:44.984
Abigail.

1:23:53.590 --> 1:23:54.423
Burn it.

1:23:57.772 --> 1:23:59.172
I've carried it long enough.

1:24:24.410 --> 1:24:29.410
I didn't know how to
tell you, I was ashamed.

1:24:45.647 --> 1:24:49.314
- There's something
else I have to tell you.

1:24:51.937 --> 1:24:53.393
You must go tomorrow.

1:24:57.070 --> 1:24:58.203
I know you have to.

1:25:01.260 --> 1:25:06.260
And I know after I may not see you again.

1:25:15.741 --> 1:25:17.441
Will you sleep by my side tonight?

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:21.073
Yes.

1:25:55.769 --> 1:25:57.280
If you came here for water, take what

1:25:57.280 --> 1:25:58.680
you need and be on your way.

1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:07.683
Do you know a woman named Abigail?

1:26:12.160 --> 1:26:14.310
- She lived with
me here for a while.

1:26:15.300 --> 1:26:19.270
She left not long after...

1:26:22.490 --> 1:26:23.753
After what?

1:26:27.125 --> 1:26:27.958
I can't.

1:26:30.810 --> 1:26:33.610
Up on the hill you'll find

1:26:33.610 --> 1:26:35.387
what you're looking for.

1:28:39.651 --> 1:28:41.516
Gail?

1:28:56.300 --> 1:28:57.450
Let's leave this place.

1:29:26.190 --> 1:29:30.363
Jack, I never should have left.

1:29:32.370 --> 1:29:34.290
Well, if you hadn't,

1:29:34.290 --> 1:29:35.640
I never would've found you.

1:29:39.200 --> 1:29:40.468
Get down!

1:29:42.610 --> 1:29:43.453
Travers!

1:29:48.470 --> 1:29:50.063
Travers, you hear me?

1:29:51.237 --> 1:29:52.070
It's White.

1:29:52.070 --> 1:29:53.070
You're not gonna get away

1:29:53.070 --> 1:29:54.203
this time, Travers.

1:29:55.090 --> 1:29:55.923
Your gun.

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:00.250
I left it on the grave.

1:30:04.247 --> 1:30:06.306
Your rifle's on the horse.

1:30:07.300 --> 1:30:08.390
I'm taking you back

1:30:08.390 --> 1:30:10.600
to the fort, Travers.

1:30:12.530 --> 1:30:14.308
Do you hear me?

1:30:17.390 --> 1:30:18.223
Wait here.

1:30:22.940 --> 1:30:23.773
Jack!

1:30:24.667 --> 1:30:25.972
Travers!

1:30:37.900 --> 1:30:38.903
Give yourself up!

1:30:47.019 --> 1:30:48.198
Ugh!

1:30:48.198 --> 1:30:49.629
Uh.

1:30:50.462 --> 1:30:51.295
Ugh!

1:30:52.510 --> 1:30:53.775
Oh.

1:30:55.168 --> 1:30:56.001
Oh.

1:30:58.806 --> 1:31:02.145
White, let him go.

1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:05.453
He's a deserter.

1:31:07.143 --> 1:31:09.090
If you let us leave,

1:31:09.090 --> 1:31:10.840
I promise we'll never hurt another soul

1:31:10.840 --> 1:31:11.883
as long as we live.

1:31:12.950 --> 1:31:14.852
He doesn't deserve to live.

1:31:16.145 --> 1:31:17.478
Ugh uh.
