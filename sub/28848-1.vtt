[Miles] <i>Hey, Chase,
let me tell you something, man.</i>

01:29.746 --> 01:30.812
<i>When I got out
of the shower tonight,</i>

01:30.814 --> 01:31.913
<i>I used a product
I have never used before</i>

01:31.915 --> 01:33.714
<i>called Gold's Dawn
Medicated Body Rub.</i>

01:33.716 --> 01:34.949
[Chase laughs]

01:34.951 --> 01:37.386
[Miles] <i>It feels like my entire
ass crack is smoking a Newport!</i>

01:37.388 --> 01:38.553
[Chase] <i>I think
I hear it cracking right now!</i>

01:38.555 --> 01:39.722
[Miles] <i>Man, my dick
and nuts are starring,</i>

01:39.724 --> 01:41.123
<i>and it's on your
Peppermint Patty commercial.</i>

- [Chase] <i>Oh, Jesus Christ!</i>
- [Miles] <i>Nah, I tell you, kid,</i>

01:43.661 --> 01:44.826
<i>whoo-ah,
I don't get no respect at all.</i>

01:44.828 --> 01:46.895
<i>My dick's so small,
I can piss on my balls.</i>

01:47.932 --> 01:50.835
[Miles] <i>Whoa!
Turn the subways, Kevin!</i>

01:51.468 --> 01:52.633
<i>Whoo-ah.</i>

01:52.635 --> 01:54.403
[Chase] <i>Whoo-ah. Now we're back
to Al Pacino again.</i>

01:54.405 --> 01:55.470
[Miles] <i>We're back
to Al Pacino, baby.</i>

01:55.472 --> 01:56.604
[Chase] <i>Of course,
Denzel Washington,</i>

01:56.606 --> 01:57.806
<i>Al Pacino, whatever it is.
Jesus Christ!</i>

01:57.808 --> 01:59.607
[Miles] <i>Listen, I get in
a three-finger stance,</i>

01:59.609 --> 02:00.609
<i>and blitz a fat bitch</i>

02:00.611 --> 02:01.776
<i>and fuck the hell
outta her, man.</i>

02:01.778 --> 02:03.978
<i>You ever fucked a fat broad?
Jesus Christ!</i>

02:03.980 --> 02:05.681
- <i>It smelled like...</i>
- [Chase] <i>As fat as you, or?</i>

02:05.683 --> 02:06.749
- [Miles] <i>Shit, fatter.</i>
- [Chase] <i>Fatter?</i>

02:06.751 --> 02:08.017
- [Miles] <i>Fatter!</i>
- [Chase] <i>Fatter than you?</i>

02:08.019 --> 02:10.384
[Miles] <i>I love pussy that smell
like day-old deli, nigga.</i>

02:10.387 --> 02:11.653
[Chase] <i>How did you
get them upstairs?</i>

02:11.655 --> 02:13.655
[Miles] <i>Easy! I lured them
with chicken nuggets.</i>

02:13.657 --> 02:15.923
[both laughing]

02:15.925 --> 02:17.925
[Miles] <i>Yo, you remember
that time we went to Cabo, man,</i>

02:17.927 --> 02:21.029
<i>for the weekend,
and we got fucking annihilated?</i>

02:21.031 --> 02:22.830
<i>We ended up fucking
that entire village.</i>

02:22.832 --> 02:25.834
[groans]
<i>Dude, that was fucking awesome.</i>

02:25.836 --> 02:27.835
[Chase] <i>Yeah, because you guys
were in trouble, that's why.</i>

02:27.837 --> 02:29.738
- [Miles] <i>Yeah, you know...</i>
- [Chase] <i>As always, right?</i>

02:29.740 --> 02:31.572
[Miles] You know
how we roll, man.

02:31.574 --> 02:33.074
Dude, have some more drink,
baby!

02:33.076 --> 02:34.342
[Chase] I'm trying to drink,

02:34.344 --> 02:35.344
but you're like
continuously talking

02:35.346 --> 02:36.811
- about black lives, blue lives,
- Hey, listen...

02:36.813 --> 02:38.346
white lives, Chinese lives...

02:38.348 --> 02:40.749
You supply these
great fucking cigars, man.

02:40.751 --> 02:41.949
I'm on a natural
fucking high, man.

02:41.951 --> 02:42.951
[laughs]

02:42.953 --> 02:44.386
[Miles] Of all the years
I've been knowing you,

02:44.388 --> 02:45.519
I've always wanted to ask,

02:45.521 --> 02:46.623
you've ever been
with a Black woman?

02:48.092 --> 02:49.391
[Chase] I plead
the fifth, my friend,

02:49.393 --> 02:50.459
- I plead the fifth!
- [groans]

02:50.461 --> 02:51.529
[both laugh]

02:52.362 --> 02:53.428
Hey, listen, man,

02:53.430 --> 02:54.495
I can't tell you how many times

02:54.497 --> 02:56.798
I've snuck into your house
and watched you sleep.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.500
[Miles] Aw, it's so cute
when you wear the pillow

02:58.502 --> 02:59.567
- between your legs.
- [Chase] What?

02:59.569 --> 03:00.435
- [Chase laughing]
- Jesus!

03:00.437 --> 03:02.137
How many times
I wanted to spoon you

03:02.139 --> 03:03.437
in the middle of the night.

03:03.439 --> 03:05.874
[both laughing]

03:05.876 --> 03:07.542
- Oh, god!
- [Chase] I think, here,

03:07.544 --> 03:09.477
- this is dawg, and then...
- That's... I think, I think...

03:09.479 --> 03:10.548
You should have some more.

03:12.549 --> 03:14.548
[Chase] <i>Friendship.</i>

03:14.550 --> 03:17.421
<i>"A state of mutual trust
and support between two people."</i>

03:18.756 --> 03:20.390
<i>According to the dictionary.</i>

03:22.992 --> 03:24.659
[Chase] You're not listening
to me, brother.

03:24.661 --> 03:26.595
I told you a thousand times.

03:26.597 --> 03:27.995
You gotta take 'em
to a public place.

03:27.997 --> 03:28.996
If she doesn't look good,

03:28.998 --> 03:30.766
you're just gonna walk around
a little bit.

03:30.768 --> 03:31.900
Don't go in anywhere,

03:31.902 --> 03:33.070
'cause you gonna have to end up
spending a lot of money.

03:34.972 --> 03:36.804
I don't know!
Give it 30 or 40 minutes.

03:36.806 --> 03:38.806
Come up with an excuse.

03:38.808 --> 03:40.674
Something like, I don't know,
you have to work in the morning,

03:40.676 --> 03:42.479
your dog is sick
or something like that.

03:43.580 --> 03:44.645
If you're stupid horny,

03:44.647 --> 03:45.846
obviously,
you start at your place,

03:45.848 --> 03:46.915
bag it and fuck.

03:46.917 --> 03:48.683
I mean,
it's kinda simple, really.

03:48.685 --> 03:50.886
if you think about it.
[spits]

03:50.888 --> 03:51.987
[Chase] You're not listening.

03:51.989 --> 03:54.423
I told you
a thousand times, man.

03:54.425 --> 03:55.723
You gotta keep looking
at those pictures

03:55.725 --> 03:57.559
a little longer.

03:57.561 --> 03:59.530
Don't swipe so goddamn fast.

04:03.766 --> 04:04.936
Hey, listen, uh...

04:07.104 --> 04:08.773
Let me call you back
in a bit, okay?

04:15.078 --> 04:16.213
[handbrake clicks]

04:20.083 --> 04:21.986
[clatters]

04:25.521 --> 04:27.125

04:33.596 --> 04:35.599
[foreboding music]

04:53.649 --> 04:55.652
[foreboding music continues]

05:21.043 --> 05:22.045
[Turley] Hey.

05:23.247 --> 05:25.779
- C?
- Yeah.

05:25.781 --> 05:26.647
[Turley chuckles]

05:26.649 --> 05:29.550
I thought you'd be taller.
[chuckles]

05:29.552 --> 05:30.719
Is that a problem?

05:30.721 --> 05:33.988
[Turley] No, I just figured
you'd be a little more...

05:33.990 --> 05:35.723
seasoned, that's all.

05:35.725 --> 05:37.259
Well, I figured
you being something other

05:37.261 --> 05:39.931
than a Payless fucking suit
two sizes too small.

05:41.564 --> 05:43.098
Are we gonna have
this conversation like this,

05:43.100 --> 05:45.534
or you're gonna invite me in?

05:45.536 --> 05:47.135
[Turley] Oh, no, sorry.

05:47.137 --> 05:49.003
Please. Please come in.

05:49.005 --> 05:51.106
[dog barking]

05:51.108 --> 05:52.677
[Turley] Sparkle, quiet!

05:54.043 --> 05:56.978
Uh, sorry about the, the mess.

05:56.980 --> 05:58.049
Why don't you...

05:58.949 --> 06:00.117
Yeah. Yeah, have a seat.

06:02.019 --> 06:04.084
You're not allergic to dogs,
are you?

06:04.086 --> 06:05.786
I'm fine.

06:05.788 --> 06:06.921
Your dog's name is Sparkle?

06:06.923 --> 06:08.723
- [Sparkle barks]
- Yeah.

06:08.725 --> 06:10.291
[chuckles]
She's a real sweetheart.

06:10.293 --> 06:11.593
- [Sparkle barks]
- [Turley] Hey.

06:11.595 --> 06:12.930
Shut up, you bitch.

06:14.764 --> 06:16.932
Uh, so, can I get you something?

06:16.934 --> 06:18.065
[Turley] Coffee, water...

06:18.067 --> 06:19.069
I'm good.

06:20.036 --> 06:21.037
Okay.

06:23.005 --> 06:24.238
Uh, I'm a little nervous.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.908
Hey, hey, hey, just relax, okay?

06:26.910 --> 06:28.009
Take a deep breath.

06:28.011 --> 06:29.209
[Chase] Yeah? All right?

06:29.211 --> 06:31.211
Let's get this done
quickly here, okay?

06:31.213 --> 06:33.081
A little tip for the road.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.983
Take out the trash,
clean up the plates,

06:34.985 --> 06:36.918
and get some fucking
air freshener.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.920
'Cause it smells like
four-day-old horseshit in here.

06:38.922 --> 06:39.820
Yeah, I know, I know.

06:39.822 --> 06:41.221
I had to take out
a couple of extra...

06:41.223 --> 06:42.824
Hey!

06:42.826 --> 06:45.129
I don't care, okay?

06:48.165 --> 06:49.697
Get the money,
show it to me in full,

06:49.699 --> 06:50.632
or I'm walking.

06:50.634 --> 06:52.033
Let's keep this professional,
shall we?

06:52.035 --> 06:53.267
Look, I, I got it.

06:53.269 --> 06:54.402
All of it.

06:54.404 --> 06:55.937
Well, it shouldn't be a problem
showing it to me, then.

06:55.939 --> 06:58.609
I just thought it'd be half
at first.

07:00.677 --> 07:01.743
All right, listen.

07:01.745 --> 07:03.043
You listening?
You listening to me?

07:03.045 --> 07:04.178
- Yeah.
- You're looking at me, right?

07:04.180 --> 07:05.846
Yeah? Okay, good.

07:05.848 --> 07:08.652
I don't fucking care
what you think.

07:09.987 --> 07:11.685
I want you to show me
the money in full

07:11.687 --> 07:13.087
in about 11 seconds.

07:13.089 --> 07:15.856
Or I'm gonna spray a masterpiece
of your fucking brains

07:15.858 --> 07:17.091
on this wall over there.

07:17.093 --> 07:18.192
- [Chase] You got that?
- Yeah.

07:18.194 --> 07:20.961
- Capisce?
- Yeah, okay, okay.

07:20.963 --> 07:22.964
No problem,
just give me a minute then.

07:22.966 --> 07:24.699
[Turley] I got it all.

07:24.701 --> 07:27.868
[sighs]
Fucking bullshit.

07:27.870 --> 07:29.139
[cell phone vibrates]

07:33.810 --> 07:34.812
Hm.

07:41.817 --> 07:43.118
[clattering in distance]

07:43.120 --> 07:46.187
[Turley] I, I got it, all of it.

07:46.189 --> 07:48.656
[Chase] Take it out,
skim through it.

07:48.658 --> 07:50.959
[Turley] Hey, uh...
Aren't you gonna count it?

07:50.961 --> 07:52.226
[Chase] It's about right
for the amount.

07:52.228 --> 07:53.293
Put it on the table.

07:53.295 --> 07:55.163
- All right.
- And sit down.

07:55.165 --> 07:56.233
[Turley] Right.

08:00.370 --> 08:02.336
Uh, say, can I ask you
a question

08:02.338 --> 08:03.608
without you getting upset?

08:04.107 --> 08:04.908
Sure.

08:06.843 --> 08:09.780
Why do you get all of it
right away...

08:11.848 --> 08:13.150
when you haven't even
done it yet?

08:15.752 --> 08:18.786
Because I'm not coming
fucking back here, am I?

08:18.788 --> 08:20.290
I take it, get it done,
and that's that.

08:22.059 --> 08:24.058
How do I know
you're not gonna just,

08:24.060 --> 08:25.729
take it and not do it?

08:28.130 --> 08:30.130
Remind me.

08:30.132 --> 08:32.166
You and Slider
are linked to this, correct?

08:32.168 --> 08:33.934
- Yeah. Slider.
- Yeah.

08:33.937 --> 08:35.306
You know how he got his name?

08:37.073 --> 08:38.138
Oh, yeah.

08:38.140 --> 08:40.441
Oh, yeah.

08:40.443 --> 08:43.647
So why on earth
would I fucking blow you over?

08:46.249 --> 08:48.182
- Good point.
- Yeah, it's a good point.

08:48.184 --> 08:49.919
- Yeah.
- [taps]

08:55.024 --> 08:56.092
Hey.

08:57.827 --> 09:00.930
Told you over the phone,
I have very few rules.

09:01.831 --> 09:03.397
Set my base price.

09:03.399 --> 09:05.035
Double for women,
triple for kids.

09:06.168 --> 09:08.268
But I get it done.

09:08.270 --> 09:10.440
Meet in person one time,
and that's it.

09:11.274 --> 09:13.074
I collect up front,

09:13.076 --> 09:15.245
and you never contact me again.

09:17.514 --> 09:19.182
I don't do repeat customers,

09:20.082 --> 09:21.251
so you choose wisely.

09:22.519 --> 09:24.118
[Sparkle barking]

09:24.120 --> 09:26.820
Might do your dog in
for free, though.

09:26.822 --> 09:30.324
Oh, how I do know
when you got it done?

09:30.326 --> 09:32.093
Just watch the fucking news.

09:32.095 --> 09:33.230
You'll see.

09:35.065 --> 09:36.467
- Yeah, oh...
- [door closes]

09:38.134 --> 09:39.836
[Turley] It's okay, Sparkle.

09:42.172 --> 09:43.206
[Chase sniffles]

09:44.140 --> 09:46.142
[foreboding music]

09:52.249 --> 09:53.915
[Chase] <i>You're taught
your whole life to be passionate</i>

[Chase] <i>What you need to do</i>

10:09.164 --> 10:11.098

<i>I'm talking literally,

<i>If you're too in your head
while fucking somebody,</i>

10:21.477 --> 10:24.445

<i>Well same thing to your craft.</i>

10:27.017 --> 10:28.382
<i>You worry so much
about performing,</i>

10:40.529 --> 10:42.397
<i>Do they have kids?</i>

10:42.399 --> 10:44.965
[scoffs]
<i>Maybe they're a good person.</i>

10:44.967 --> 10:46.968
<i>None of that bullshit.</i>

10:46.970 --> 10:48.368
- <i>Get paid...</i>
- [groans]

10:48.370 --> 10:50.540
<i>...get it done, and move on.</i>

10:52.042 --> 10:53.244
[groans]

10:57.080 --> 11:00.448
[Chase] <i>There are only
two people I really care about.</i>

11:00.450 --> 11:03.951
<i>I guess you can call that
the chink in my armor.</i>

11:03.953 --> 11:07.354
<i>They're also the two people
that ever made me feel anything.</i>

11:07.356 --> 11:09.223
<i>So I kept them around.</i>

11:09.225 --> 11:11.191
- [water running]
- [Blair] Oh, my god.

11:11.193 --> 11:14.595
Don't scare me like that.

11:14.597 --> 11:16.964
[Chase] <i>Blair is a lot like me
in all the worst ways.</i>

11:16.966 --> 11:18.398
Oh, oh, I see.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.236
[Chase]
<i>Just a slightly better version.</i>

11:23.173 --> 11:25.506
- <i>Micah is nothing like me...</i>
- [Chase sighs deeply]

11:25.508 --> 11:27.011
<i>...and I want
to keep it that way.</i>

11:32.649 --> 11:34.851
[gunshots]

11:42.024 --> 11:43.126
[door opens]

11:47.964 --> 11:49.233
Where's Mommy?

11:56.940 --> 11:58.973
[Chase] <i>I told myself
after that,</i>

11:58.975 --> 12:01.245
<i>my only rule
was never to orphan a kid.</i>

12:09.184 --> 12:10.251
[Chase sighs deeply]

12:10.253 --> 12:13.021
[Chase] <i>I'm open
to anything else, but...</i>

12:13.023 --> 12:15.623
<i>that look Micah gave me
and the first time I saw him,</i>

12:15.625 --> 12:17.094
<i>will always haunt me.</i>

12:21.197 --> 12:24.198
<i>Now, before you think
I'm a total piece of shit,</i>

12:24.200 --> 12:27.435
<i>I actually provide for them
pretty well.</i>

12:27.437 --> 12:30.274
<i>I take the little of what I need
and give them the rest.</i>

12:31.607 --> 12:34.041
<i>I never thought of myself
as a family man,</i>

12:34.043 --> 12:36.377
<i>much less a father, but...</i>

12:36.379 --> 12:39.314
<i>I guess the chips fell
where they did.</i>

12:39.316 --> 12:41.616
<i>They're my only liability.</i>

12:41.618 --> 12:43.420
<i>The only thing I like more
than my work.</i>

12:48.524 --> 12:50.526
[somber music]

12:56.566 --> 12:58.166
[Chase] <i>I could go
to any meeting</i>

12:58.168 --> 12:59.302
<i>and feel in control.</i>

13:00.503 --> 13:01.536
<i>But there's only one person</i>

13:01.538 --> 13:03.407
<i>that tried to upstage me
every time.</i>

13:08.345 --> 13:11.179
[indistinct chatter]

13:11.181 --> 13:12.512
[Chase] <i>The only other person</i>

13:12.514 --> 13:14.083
<i>you could say
I care anything about...</i>

13:15.217 --> 13:16.286
<i>is Miles.</i>

13:17.086 --> 13:18.151
[snickers]

13:18.153 --> 13:20.354
Shit! Come on C, Come on, C.

13:20.356 --> 13:21.723
[Chase] <i>I met Miles
in foster care</i>

13:21.725 --> 13:24.525
<i>and he helped me leave
with him at 15.</i>

13:24.527 --> 13:26.294
<i>Unlike me...</i>

13:26.296 --> 13:29.162
<i>Miles always knew
what he wanted to do.</i>

13:29.164 --> 13:30.500
<i>And it was nothing legal.</i>

13:32.168 --> 13:34.134
[gate clatters]

13:34.136 --> 13:35.469
[Chase] <i>We were
always competitive</i>

13:35.471 --> 13:36.706
<i>with everything that we did.</i>

13:39.174 --> 13:42.310
<i>We knew each other's strengths,
weaknesses,</i>

13:42.312 --> 13:43.514
<i>and how to exploit them.</i>

13:45.581 --> 13:48.652
<i>Miles got pleasure out of
cerebrally mind-fucking anybody.</i>

13:52.621 --> 13:57.124
<i>He reinvented both of us,
and we never looked back.</i>

13:57.360 --> 13:59.426
<i>He was precise about it all.</i>

13:59.428 --> 14:00.561
<i>Even to this day, I...</i>

14:00.563 --> 14:03.397
<i>I don't even know
what his real name is.</i>

14:03.399 --> 14:06.566
<i>He gave me the name Chase
when we were kids.</i>

14:06.568 --> 14:08.335
<i>Then he wanted to be Miles.</i>

14:08.337 --> 14:10.606
<i>Always running, both of us.</i>

14:12.341 --> 14:14.574
<i>Miles was an ace
at everything he did,</i>

14:14.576 --> 14:15.776
<i>except for women.</i>

14:15.778 --> 14:19.213
<i>He's either really bad with them
or just doesn't care.</i>

14:19.215 --> 14:20.680
<i>That's why I try
to give him advice,</i>

14:20.682 --> 14:23.050
<i>and then when I can,
but, with him...</i>

14:23.052 --> 14:24.353
[Chase scoffs]

14:24.355 --> 14:27.155
<i>...he tries to give me advice
on everything else.</i>

14:27.157 --> 14:30.090
<i>If you think I didn't give
a shit about anything,</i>

14:30.092 --> 14:33.161
<i>Miles really doesn't give
a fuck.</i>

14:33.163 --> 14:35.762
<i>When I'm not getting referrals
on my own,</i>

14:35.764 --> 14:37.531
<i>Miles finds me work on hits.</i>

14:37.533 --> 14:39.533
<i>We're a well-worked machine.</i>

14:39.535 --> 14:42.536
<i>There's only one thing
that torches his balls about me,</i>

14:42.538 --> 14:44.372
<i>and he brings it up
every time we meet.</i>

14:44.374 --> 14:46.440
[Miles] Oh, look at this shit.

14:46.442 --> 14:47.507
- [Chase] 'Sup?
- [Miles] Brother's on time,

14:47.509 --> 14:49.243
but the white boy late.

14:49.245 --> 14:50.844
Welcome to the party, son.

14:50.846 --> 14:52.814
You know, during
the Obama administration,

14:52.816 --> 14:54.549
tardiness was a big no-no.

14:54.551 --> 14:56.850
This Trump shit
got you fucked up, man.

14:56.852 --> 14:59.252
Hey, look, word to the wise,

14:59.254 --> 15:00.521
in the future,
if you want me to sit

15:00.523 --> 15:02.290
and wait around for you forever,

15:02.292 --> 15:04.392
man, don't pick a spot
in the fucking Valley, man.

15:04.394 --> 15:05.528
Look around.

15:07.197 --> 15:08.463
I'm the only nigga in here.

15:08.465 --> 15:11.165
Jesus, fucking crybaby, man.

15:11.167 --> 15:12.733
Stop sending me
to fucking Chink town, then.

15:12.735 --> 15:14.201
[Chase] How about that, huh?

15:14.203 --> 15:15.703
Every time I go down
to that fucking shit hole

15:15.705 --> 15:18.305
it's like, they're still
recovering from Nagasaki.

15:18.307 --> 15:20.273
You racist-ass white boy.

15:20.275 --> 15:22.276
Shit, you got paid, though,
didn't you?

15:22.278 --> 15:24.344
What difference does it make
where the place is from?

15:24.346 --> 15:26.414
At the end of the day,
paper is paper, right?

15:26.416 --> 15:27.618
Paper is paper.

15:28.618 --> 15:29.483
[slurps]

15:29.485 --> 15:31.151
Look, have I ever
steered you wrong

15:31.153 --> 15:32.386
with one of my leads, man?

15:32.388 --> 15:35.156
I can think
of a couple of times.

15:35.158 --> 15:36.424
Oh, you gonna bring
that shit up?

15:36.426 --> 15:37.592
- [Chase] Yeah.
- [chuckles]

15:37.594 --> 15:39.160
[Chase] Well, you were gonna
bring it up anyway, right?

15:39.162 --> 15:40.195
Thought I beat you to it.

15:40.197 --> 15:41.661
Look, man, the only reason
why it was a problem

15:41.663 --> 15:42.729
is because you made it
your business.

15:42.731 --> 15:43.797
Come on, man,
don't get mad at me

15:43.799 --> 15:44.866
'cause you caught feelings,
nigga.

15:44.868 --> 15:46.267
Ah. Fuck, man.

15:46.269 --> 15:47.468
Let's not fucking talk
about this shit, okay?

15:47.470 --> 15:49.239
No, no.
We gonna talk about this.

15:50.472 --> 15:51.506
[Miles]
Because up to this point,

15:51.508 --> 15:54.775
you've been ice-cold
about everything but this.

15:54.777 --> 15:56.643
So, what that says to me
is that, obviously,

15:56.645 --> 15:58.646
there's another chink
in your armor.

15:58.648 --> 16:00.547
Besides the fact that you let
two motherfuckers in

16:00.549 --> 16:02.150
that you're not even supposed
to give a fuck about.

16:02.152 --> 16:03.417
Well, they shouldn't
concern you.

16:03.419 --> 16:05.288
- It's never affected my work.
- [Miles] Well, what if it does?

16:07.423 --> 16:09.623
I don't want you
going soft on me, man.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.626
I don't ever want you
to go soft on me.

16:11.628 --> 16:12.694
Ever!

16:12.696 --> 16:14.427
I don't give a fuck
if it's from two years ago,

16:14.429 --> 16:16.664
you go soft on me,
I'm gonna make sure, Chase,

16:16.666 --> 16:17.898
and I'd do everything
in my power...

16:17.900 --> 16:19.432
What?

16:19.434 --> 16:21.170
You're gonna doing fucking what?

16:23.339 --> 16:24.906
Are you guys ready to order
or do you need a minute?

16:24.908 --> 16:26.643
Two minutes.

16:27.610 --> 16:28.711
Two minutes.

16:31.614 --> 16:33.848
That's a bad bitch right there.

16:33.850 --> 16:36.184
[Miles] Look, Chase,
you're my man, 50 grand and all.

16:36.186 --> 16:37.551
Official tissue, baby.

16:37.553 --> 16:39.853
I ain't managed nobody better.

16:39.855 --> 16:42.390
But don't go thinking
for one fucking second,

16:42.392 --> 16:43.824
that nothing is irreplaceable.

16:43.826 --> 16:45.392
You heard me?

16:45.394 --> 16:46.629
What are you trying
to say, Miles?

16:50.299 --> 16:51.300
There it is.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.868
See? There it is.

16:53.870 --> 16:56.572
[Miles] That coal in your eyes,
that ice in your veins.

16:57.307 --> 16:58.638
Keep that shit.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.574
[Miles] Don't ever let
that go, man!

17:00.576 --> 17:01.709
What makes you think I am?

17:01.711 --> 17:03.444
Look, just let me finish.

17:03.446 --> 17:04.911
Remember what I told you?

17:04.913 --> 17:07.381
You know how motherfuckers
end up done in this business?

17:07.383 --> 17:08.949
They get emotional.

17:08.951 --> 17:10.984
Whether it was pride, or just,

17:10.987 --> 17:12.455
straight out giving a fuck.

17:13.489 --> 17:14.657
It's what deads 'em.

17:15.656 --> 17:17.892
Do you wanna go to prison? Huh?

17:17.894 --> 17:20.260
[Miles] You wanna end up
some fuck buddy?

17:20.262 --> 17:22.496
You wanna die, Chase?

17:22.498 --> 17:25.632
Look, I suggest you remove
that fucking conscience.

17:25.634 --> 17:27.371
Whatever else you got going on
in your head,

17:27.971 --> 17:29.402
put it to bed.

17:29.404 --> 17:30.540
And if you do that shit,

17:31.540 --> 17:32.675
well, you know...

17:33.542 --> 17:34.777
zero slippage, man.

17:36.546 --> 17:37.548
[scoffs]

17:40.516 --> 17:43.417
One more fucking minute, please!

17:43.419 --> 17:44.421
Great.

17:48.825 --> 17:49.826
How about this?

17:52.828 --> 17:55.830
You stop telling me
how to do my fucking job,

17:55.832 --> 17:58.498
and I stop giving you advice
on how to avoid porkers

17:58.500 --> 17:59.767
and chicks with dicks.

17:59.769 --> 18:00.834
[chuckles]

18:00.836 --> 18:02.702
How does that sound? Huh?

18:02.704 --> 18:04.872
Aah, motherfucker!

18:04.874 --> 18:05.907
[both chuckle]

18:05.909 --> 18:08.042
Got me feeling like Denzel
in <i>Training Day.</i>

18:08.044 --> 18:09.910
[imitating Denzel]
Hey. Hey, Chase.

18:09.912 --> 18:12.912
[Chase] <i>Miles always brought up
that vulnerable shit to me.</i>

18:12.914 --> 18:15.650
<i>But I think this time,
something stuck with him.</i>

18:15.652 --> 18:16.785
[laughing]

18:16.787 --> 18:17.951
[Chase] <i>Through the laughter
and joking,</i>

18:17.953 --> 18:19.853
<i>something had laden me, as well.</i>

18:19.855 --> 18:22.523
<i>I might not
have known it, but...</i>

18:22.525 --> 18:25.625
<i>from that point on,
Miles didn't trust me.</i>

18:25.627 --> 18:26.696
I'll give you the finger!

18:34.002 --> 18:36.304
[lawyer]
So, we're just gonna have to,

18:36.306 --> 18:38.738
have you sign a few pages here.

18:38.740 --> 18:40.540
[Chase] <i>After Blair's dad
passed away</i>

18:40.542 --> 18:42.375
<i>a couple of years back,</i>

18:42.377 --> 18:44.711
<i>she inherited
a good amount of money.</i>

18:44.713 --> 18:46.282
<i>At least enough to get her by.</i>

18:48.084 --> 18:49.850
<i>Now, I know
you're asking yourself,</i>

18:49.852 --> 18:52.018
<i>why the fuck would I keep doing
what I'm doing</i>

18:52.020 --> 18:53.423
<i>if Blair is already set?</i>

18:54.691 --> 18:56.489
<i>The point is,</i>

18:56.491 --> 18:58.359
<i>it's my passion.</i>

18:58.361 --> 19:00.597
<i>You can't quit that shit easily
if you enjoy doing it.</i>

19:01.431 --> 19:03.029
<i>Care or not care,</i>

19:03.031 --> 19:04.065
<i>I'm good at what I do.</i>

19:04.067 --> 19:05.498
<i>And when you're good
at something,</i>

19:05.500 --> 19:06.734
<i>you keep doing it.</i>

19:06.736 --> 19:09.006
<i>For validation, for respect.</i>

19:13.843 --> 19:16.043
<i>Blair's passion was painting.</i>

19:16.045 --> 19:18.978
<i>Anything artistic, she owned it.</i>

19:18.980 --> 19:21.082
<i>When she's not taking care
of Micah,</i>

19:21.084 --> 19:23.417
<i>or me, for that matter,</i>

19:23.419 --> 19:24.721
<i>she's in her studio.</i>

19:25.421 --> 19:26.423
[Chase chuckles]

19:27.457 --> 19:28.789
<i>For me,</i>

19:28.791 --> 19:32.392
<i>I couldn't tell a fucking
Van Gogh from a Van Damme.</i>

19:32.394 --> 19:33.960
<i>But she's recently
been teaching Micah</i>

19:33.962 --> 19:35.629
<i>a thing or two about it.</i>

19:35.631 --> 19:36.733
<i>Which I dig.</i>

19:38.000 --> 19:39.869
- [Chase] Hey, champ.
- Hey.

19:41.804 --> 19:43.136
[Chase] <i>To be honest,</i>

19:43.138 --> 19:45.373
<i>it's getting harder and harder
to come home for them</i>

19:45.375 --> 19:46.710
<i>after a day's work.</i>

19:47.809 --> 19:50.111
<i>And maybe Miles was right.</i>

19:50.113 --> 19:51.948
<i>He saw something in me changing.</i>

19:52.848 --> 19:54.914
<i>See...</i>
[sighs]

19:54.916 --> 19:56.786
<i>...Blair knows a little
of what I do, but,</i>

19:58.554 --> 20:00.688
<i>not everything.</i>

20:00.690 --> 20:02.890
<i>She's actually cool with it.</i>

20:02.892 --> 20:06.393
<i>'Cause she thinks, first,
everybody I do are bad,</i>

20:06.395 --> 20:11.132
<i>and second, that I'm distancing
myself from Miles.</i>

20:11.134 --> 20:13.737
<i>Let's just say the contempt
between them is pretty mutual.</i>

20:16.172 --> 20:18.037
<i>They only met
a handful of times</i>

20:18.039 --> 20:19.940
<i>since I've been
with Blair, but...</i>

20:19.942 --> 20:21.141
<i>that was enough,</i>

20:21.143 --> 20:24.444
<i>and they both have their reasons
for hating each other.</i>

20:24.446 --> 20:26.514
- [Chase] Whatcha got there?
- Mmm.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.047
[dumbbells clatter]

20:28.049 --> 20:29.517
[Chase] Oh, my god, it's done.

20:29.519 --> 20:31.852
[Blair chuckles]

20:31.854 --> 20:33.586
- Oh, my god, I love that.
- What do you think?

20:33.588 --> 20:34.854
- Yeah?
- I mean, you truly captured

20:34.856 --> 20:36.824
my true form here, huh?

20:36.826 --> 20:38.793
The next time
I need an ego boost, I...

20:38.795 --> 20:41.194
I won't look in the mirror,
I'll look straight at this.

20:41.196 --> 20:42.563
[both chuckle]

20:42.565 --> 20:43.831
I think you're better in person.

20:43.833 --> 20:44.868
You think so?

20:45.768 --> 20:46.734
Yeah.

20:46.736 --> 20:48.501
Yeah. Yeah, you're definitely
the winner.

20:48.503 --> 20:49.505
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.

20:53.875 --> 20:55.742
- I'm glad you liked it.
- [both chuckle]

20:55.744 --> 20:57.076
- Where are you going?
- Hey.

20:57.078 --> 20:59.546
Hmm? Ow!

20:59.548 --> 21:01.782
- That's cheating!
- Hey, it works.

21:01.784 --> 21:02.786
[Chase sighs]

21:04.753 --> 21:05.821
[Chase grunts]

21:11.160 --> 21:12.660
[grunting]

21:12.662 --> 21:14.862
Mmm, you make noises like that,

21:14.864 --> 21:15.930
you tempt me into a good time.

21:15.932 --> 21:17.931
[Chase] Oh, babe,
you can't say that while I'm...

21:17.933 --> 21:20.133
What are you doing?

21:20.135 --> 21:23.036
You know I wanna distract you,
don't you?

21:23.038 --> 21:24.103
Thought you were ice-cold?

21:24.105 --> 21:25.506
See, nothing can phase you.

21:25.508 --> 21:26.910
- [Chase] Nothing!
- [Blair chuckles]

21:28.009 --> 21:30.244
[cellphone buzzes]

21:30.246 --> 21:32.680
- Who is that?
- [Chase] Just let it ring.

21:32.682 --> 21:33.817
- [Chase panting]
- [cellphone buzzing]

21:34.817 --> 21:36.086
[Chase] Just ignore it.

21:37.586 --> 21:38.989
[cellphone buzzing]

21:41.757 --> 21:44.257
You know, for someone so clever,

21:44.259 --> 21:46.026
you really don't think
I know who M is?

21:46.028 --> 21:47.995
[Chase sighs]

21:47.997 --> 21:49.596
[Chase] See, this is why
I don't like you down here

21:49.598 --> 21:50.965
when I'm working out.

21:50.967 --> 21:52.266
What does that have to do
with anything?

21:52.268 --> 21:54.701
Why is that dickbag calling you?

21:54.703 --> 21:55.870
I thought you said
you were cutting ties with him

21:55.872 --> 21:56.937
and doing your own thing?

21:56.939 --> 21:58.639
It's not my fault
he's calling me.

21:58.641 --> 21:59.840
Well, I thought you said
you were meeting up with him

21:59.842 --> 22:00.908
to tell him off?

22:00.910 --> 22:01.976
What happened to that?

22:01.978 --> 22:03.576
Look, it's not easy cutting ties

22:03.578 --> 22:06.046
with somebody you've known
since you were 15, okay?

22:06.048 --> 22:07.648
I know Miles can be tough,

22:07.650 --> 22:09.517
but the guy has looked out
for me since day one.

22:09.519 --> 22:11.121
And never fucked me over,
not once.

22:14.891 --> 22:18.225
[Blair] Whatever my issues
with him are, I...

22:18.227 --> 22:19.729
You guys were tight
for a long time.

22:22.565 --> 22:23.998
Wait, but you said it yourself.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.699
The past few years,
you have felt chained

22:26.701 --> 22:29.135
to a set of rules
and circumstances.

22:29.137 --> 22:30.904
See, regardless
of even meeting me,

22:30.906 --> 22:32.038
and bringing Micah along,

22:32.040 --> 22:33.175
what's the end goal here?

22:35.176 --> 22:37.277
We don't need him, Chase.

22:37.279 --> 22:39.849
You are too good at what you do
to be pegged in or limited.

22:41.049 --> 22:43.284
I know he sees me as a divider,

22:43.286 --> 22:45.689
but what I'm trying to do,
is release you.

22:46.655 --> 22:47.921
It's not all like that, though.

22:47.923 --> 22:50.759
I mean, his tough set of rules
have kept me alive this long.

22:51.693 --> 22:53.626
[scoffs]

22:53.628 --> 22:55.828
I think you're just tricking
yourself into thinking that.

22:55.830 --> 22:56.697
Well, how would you know?

22:56.699 --> 22:58.565
You don't know
the sacrifices he made

22:58.567 --> 22:59.866
to get me through this shit.

22:59.868 --> 23:00.802
[Blair] Okay, you're right,
I don't know it all.

23:00.804 --> 23:02.706
So why don't you let me in
a little bit?

23:04.240 --> 23:05.940
This whole thing
has been brewing for a while,

23:05.942 --> 23:07.844
and I feel like I'm stuck
in the fucking middle.

23:09.711 --> 23:12.548
You know, if it was just me,
and you drove me to the edge,

23:13.281 --> 23:14.283
I could just leave.

23:17.853 --> 23:19.556
But we got a kid involved,
Chase.

23:20.655 --> 23:21.758
That's our priority.

23:25.827 --> 23:26.997
Yeah, I'll tell you that much.

23:28.663 --> 23:30.096
[Chase] I mean,
the last time I met with him...

23:30.098 --> 23:31.899
[scoffs]

23:31.901 --> 23:33.003
...something was off.

23:33.935 --> 23:35.235
What do you mean?

23:35.237 --> 23:37.304
I don't know.
I mean, it was nothing obvious.

23:37.306 --> 23:38.771
It's just we talked about
the same shit

23:38.773 --> 23:39.909
we always talk about, but...

23:41.210 --> 23:43.309
I just felt something like...

23:43.311 --> 23:44.713
he looked at me differently.

23:45.748 --> 23:46.750
How?

23:47.650 --> 23:48.882
Well...

23:48.884 --> 23:49.882
you know how I always tell you

23:49.884 --> 23:51.954
Miles has the best poker face
I've ever seen?

23:53.823 --> 23:56.090
I think he picked up on me,
either being late,

23:56.092 --> 23:58.161
or bringing you
and Micah up first.

23:58.861 --> 24:00.094
But...

24:00.096 --> 24:02.161
Why would you do that?

24:02.163 --> 24:03.831
I mean,
he always brings you guys up,

24:03.833 --> 24:04.899
one way or another.

24:04.901 --> 24:06.570
I mean, he always usually
jokes about it, but...

24:08.170 --> 24:10.237
it's the seriousness about it.

24:10.239 --> 24:12.238
Like he's trying to...

24:12.240 --> 24:14.642
peel back my eyes
and get into my head,

24:14.644 --> 24:15.912
make sure to leave you guys.

24:16.878 --> 24:18.879
So, why bring it up first?

24:18.881 --> 24:20.350
And why be late?
You're never late?

24:22.250 --> 24:24.084
I know.

24:24.086 --> 24:25.622
That's what's fucking
with me right now.

24:27.722 --> 24:29.759
I guess that's what they mean
by leaving breadcrumbs.

24:30.660 --> 24:32.258
[Blair] What do you mean?

24:32.260 --> 24:35.662
Well, maybe I want him
to know something.

24:35.664 --> 24:37.331
That things are changing.

24:37.333 --> 24:38.701
[Blair sighs deeply]

24:44.839 --> 24:45.774
You need to let him go.

24:47.375 --> 24:50.076
He's a sociopath,
and a master manipulator.

24:50.078 --> 24:52.446
He can't do what you do,
so he uses you like a pawn.

24:52.448 --> 24:54.351
Like, why do you have it out
for him so much?

24:56.251 --> 24:58.187
Have I ever asked you to stop
with what you're doing?

24:59.188 --> 25:01.020
- Have I?
- [Chase] No.

25:01.022 --> 25:03.157
Do I ever ask you
any specific questions?

25:03.159 --> 25:05.159
- [Chase] No.
- Okay, so trust me,

25:05.161 --> 25:06.959
like I trust you.

25:06.961 --> 25:09.263
Miles is no good to you.

25:09.265 --> 25:10.330
He may have helped you
in the past,

25:10.332 --> 25:11.835
but now, he is dragging you.

25:13.201 --> 25:14.401
I know how you feel,

25:14.403 --> 25:16.673
because you bring him home
from work with you every night.

25:18.106 --> 25:19.873
He prefer you stay
the cold machine you were

25:19.875 --> 25:20.876
when I first met you.

25:21.876 --> 25:23.145
Easier for him to control.

25:24.180 --> 25:25.245
[scoffs]

25:25.247 --> 25:27.480
You know why he doesn't like me?

25:27.482 --> 25:29.251
Because I've helped thaw you
the fuck out.

25:31.921 --> 25:34.087
Bet if it was up to him,
he'd have me doing kids,

25:34.089 --> 25:37.092
the elderly saints, anybody,
without any remorse.

25:39.862 --> 25:40.864
Hey.

25:41.997 --> 25:44.498
You get rid of the bad, baby.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.866
And I know a lot of women
would think I'm nuts

25:46.868 --> 25:49.905
for rationalizing it that way,
but I see the good in it.

25:51.073 --> 25:53.373
[Blair] Hey, you're a cleaner.

25:53.375 --> 25:55.308
Let's talk about this
some other time, okay?

25:55.310 --> 25:56.776
[Chase] <i>I mean
I'm not deflecting,</i>

25:56.778 --> 25:59.449
<i>I promise we'll talk about it,
but let's just sleep over it.</i>

26:00.849 --> 26:02.382
[Blair sighs]

26:02.384 --> 26:04.951
[Blair] <i>Let's get you
cleaned up, anyway.</i>

26:04.953 --> 26:07.121
[Chase] <i>I could use it, huh?</i>

26:07.123 --> 26:09.259
[Blair] <i>Yeah, I think
it's shower time for both of us.</i>

26:10.226 --> 26:11.758
[Chase] <i>Well, let's do it.</i>

26:11.760 --> 26:13.160
[both chuckle]

26:13.162 --> 26:14.327
[Chase] <i>Oh, I love you, baby.</i>

26:14.329 --> 26:15.798
[Blair] <i>I love you, too.</i>

26:18.800 --> 26:20.836
[foreboding music]

26:23.071 --> 26:23.938
- Fuck!
- [shatters]

26:23.940 --> 26:26.206
I told you, Miles!
Didn't I tell you?

26:26.208 --> 26:27.440
[Burke] I fucking knew it.

26:27.442 --> 26:29.543
We gotta respond.
You heard them.

26:29.545 --> 26:30.611
[Burke] I swear to god.

26:30.613 --> 26:32.813
If we had put bugs
in any other room in that house,

26:32.815 --> 26:34.180
we would have found this out
months ago.

26:34.182 --> 26:36.283
They never gave a fuck
about your interest at all,

26:36.285 --> 26:37.287
neither of them.

26:39.154 --> 26:40.222
[Burke] Look.

26:41.222 --> 26:42.725
Just let me do him.

26:45.094 --> 26:46.927
Let me do both of them.

26:46.929 --> 26:48.331
Fuck, I'll even add the kid.

26:49.832 --> 26:50.930
- [thuds]
- [Burke groans]

26:50.932 --> 26:53.400
[Lola] Stop, Miles!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

26:53.402 --> 26:55.001
[Lola] You know you didn't have
to fucking do that.

26:55.003 --> 26:56.903
Hey, Burke,
Control your bitch, nigga.

26:56.905 --> 26:57.906
Bitch nigga!

26:58.273 --> 26:59.972
[groans]

26:59.974 --> 27:01.844
[Miles] I think now that I got
y'all's fucking attention...

27:02.811 --> 27:03.879
Can I have the floor?

27:05.181 --> 27:06.580
You really didn't need
to do that.

27:06.582 --> 27:07.847
[mouths]
Hey, stop, okay?

27:07.849 --> 27:09.382
Hey.

27:09.384 --> 27:10.449
[Miles] Man the fuck up!

27:10.451 --> 27:11.985
Oh, fuck.

27:11.987 --> 27:15.421
See, I'm an equal opportunity
employer.

27:15.423 --> 27:18.257
See, the same beautiful gesture
I just gave your man Burke here,

27:18.259 --> 27:21.295
I can give to you, Lola.

27:21.297 --> 27:23.930
I don't give a fuck if you are
a part of the pussy species.

27:23.932 --> 27:24.998
Yeah, noted.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.566
[Miles] Look...

27:26.568 --> 27:29.001
I know how bad
both of y'all wanna handle it.

27:29.003 --> 27:31.103
But I'm gonna tell y'all
how I wanna handle it.

27:31.105 --> 27:32.873
Chase is not to be touched.

27:32.875 --> 27:34.307
At all!

27:34.309 --> 27:35.409
But, Miles, why would...

27:35.411 --> 27:36.376
[Miles] Hey! Hey! Hey!

27:36.378 --> 27:37.844
You look like
you still got one good hand

27:37.846 --> 27:39.412
that's begging
to be fucked with.

27:39.414 --> 27:40.884
What you want is smoke.

27:42.250 --> 27:43.549
Good.

27:43.551 --> 27:45.451
Look, I've been knowing Chase
since forever.

27:45.453 --> 27:47.386
Longer than I've known you two.

27:47.388 --> 27:49.057
I know what I heard,
I know what we heard.

27:50.425 --> 27:52.459
But I'm telling you,
that's not Chase.

27:52.461 --> 27:54.193
What do you mean that's not him?

27:54.195 --> 27:56.496
Yeah, we all fucking heard him,
we know what he sounds like.

27:56.498 --> 27:59.032
Lola, check your man
before he checks himself out!

27:59.034 --> 28:00.570
Burke, just shut
the fuck up, all right?

28:01.336 --> 28:02.337
Just shut up.

28:04.006 --> 28:05.972
Look, I've been fucking
with Chase since forever,

28:05.974 --> 28:08.208
I validate the man.

28:08.210 --> 28:10.913
Shit. I've always respected him
and I've never had to stop him.

28:14.450 --> 28:16.182
Yeah, we break
each other's balls sometimes,

28:16.184 --> 28:17.553
but shit, that's par
for the course.

28:18.586 --> 28:20.286
As far as the game go...

28:20.288 --> 28:21.354
[chuckles]

28:21.356 --> 28:22.655
...that motherfucker
is a maverick.

28:22.657 --> 28:24.524
Miles, I mean this
with total respect.

28:24.526 --> 28:26.927
I get it, C has been down.

28:26.929 --> 28:29.228
But I'm the only female here,
I have to say it,

28:29.230 --> 28:30.834
the bitch is fucking
with his head.

28:32.567 --> 28:35.302
- You see that, right?
- Yeah, I know.

28:35.304 --> 28:37.907
First time he told me about her,
I knew it.

28:38.973 --> 28:40.509
That bitch put life in his eyes.

28:42.076 --> 28:43.610
[scoffs]

28:43.612 --> 28:44.913
She makes him happy.

28:47.182 --> 28:48.183
Fuck that.

28:49.384 --> 28:50.385
[coughs]

28:51.420 --> 28:52.422
Look.

28:54.056 --> 28:57.257
Before I can't get treated
or I pass out,

28:57.259 --> 29:00.259
I'd just like to know,
what are we gonna do about it?

29:00.261 --> 29:02.228
Yeah, since we can't touch him,
what's the plan?

29:02.230 --> 29:03.465
Since you have it all
figured out.

29:04.232 --> 29:05.234
Huh, Miles?

29:13.409 --> 29:15.609
[Chase] <i>I never could sleep
really well.</i>

29:15.611 --> 29:17.376
<i>Blair's advice to falling asleep</i>

29:17.378 --> 29:20.279
<i>wasn't any of that
counting sheep bullshit.</i>

29:20.281 --> 29:21.981
<i>She said to close your eyes,</i>

29:21.983 --> 29:24.116
<i>and imagine Micah
on your shoulders,</i>

29:24.118 --> 29:25.355
<i>and you carrying him.</i>

29:26.355 --> 29:28.388
<i>She said to get a rhythm going.</i>

29:28.390 --> 29:30.590
<i>Imagine Micah putting his hands
over your eyes</i>

29:30.592 --> 29:32.959
<i>and you beginning
to walk backwards,</i>

29:32.961 --> 29:34.428
<i>completely blind,</i>

29:34.430 --> 29:36.963
<i>and trusting Micah
with each step.</i>

29:36.965 --> 29:40.132
<i>A slow pacing of each step,
backwards and focusing on that,</i>

29:40.134 --> 29:41.701
<i>while my son shades me
from the world</i>

29:41.703 --> 29:43.038
<i>was the way it would work.</i>

29:45.740 --> 29:48.040
<i>I always loved the image,</i>

29:48.042 --> 29:51.077
<i>but to this day, it hasn't.</i>

29:51.079 --> 29:53.081
[cellphone buzzing]

29:57.251 --> 29:58.584
[Blair groans]

29:58.586 --> 30:00.222
[Blair sighs]

30:09.698 --> 30:10.796
Yo, what's up?

30:10.798 --> 30:12.268
[Miles] <i>You ready
for the big one, C?</i>

30:17.172 --> 30:20.039
[foreboding music]

30:20.041 --> 30:22.477
[Chase] <i>Miles never gave me
a hit like this last minute.</i>

30:24.179 --> 30:26.115
<i>So I already knew
something was up.</i>

30:27.648 --> 30:30.017
<i>What do I care, though?</i>

30:30.019 --> 30:32.255
<i>He'd always pull through for me
and the money was good.</i>

30:34.022 --> 30:35.189
<i>It would be a rush
like none other</i>

30:35.191 --> 30:38.124
<i>every time he would give me
an assignment.</i>

30:42.530 --> 30:44.166
<i>I can't explain it.</i>

30:45.534 --> 30:47.637
<i>But my body goes
into another mode.</i>

30:48.569 --> 30:50.069
<i>Always ready.</i>

30:50.071 --> 30:51.606
[man 1] Just keep looking, man,
just keep looking.

30:53.142 --> 30:55.107
[man 2] Uh, you go high,
I'll go low.

30:55.109 --> 30:56.242
Probably not gonna find it
up here.

30:56.244 --> 30:58.144
Let's just get
the fuck out of here.

30:58.146 --> 30:59.779
[man 1] Dude, get the fuck
outta here, come on.

30:59.781 --> 31:01.480
[man 2] I need a fucking drink.
When are they gonna be home?

31:01.482 --> 31:02.815
[man 1] Dude, no one's been
home for a week, let's go.

31:02.817 --> 31:04.186
What, you a fucking troll?

31:04.519 --> 31:05.584
[clangs]

31:05.586 --> 31:07.319
- What the fuck?
- [gunshot]

31:07.321 --> 31:08.587
- No!
- [gunshots]

31:08.589 --> 31:09.725
[body thuds]

31:13.828 --> 31:15.330
- [gunshot]
- [man 1 groans]

31:25.339 --> 31:26.608
[gun clanking]

31:29.611 --> 31:32.415
[ominous music]

31:49.698 --> 31:51.100
[baby sobbing]

31:53.535 --> 31:55.772
[sobbing continues]

32:00.174 --> 32:02.244
- [paper rasping]
- [baby cries]

32:15.423 --> 32:16.658
[tires screeching]

32:17.659 --> 32:19.662
[suspenseful music]

32:22.230 --> 32:23.697
C'mon babe, pick up! Pick up!

32:23.699 --> 32:25.265
Pick up! Pick up!
Pick up! C'mon!

32:25.267 --> 32:26.269
[Chase] Blair!

32:28.369 --> 32:29.835
Babe, listen,

32:29.837 --> 32:32.271
call me back as soon as you
get this message, all right?

32:32.273 --> 32:33.472
I'm on my way back home
right now,

32:33.474 --> 32:34.807
I'll explain everything
when I get there.

32:34.809 --> 32:37.846
Just, call me
as soon as you can, all right?

32:38.846 --> 32:39.848
[Chase] Fuck!

32:40.548 --> 32:42.317
[engine revving]

32:45.554 --> 32:47.123
[door slides softly]

32:48.690 --> 32:49.759
Blair?

32:53.862 --> 32:54.864
Baby?

32:59.934 --> 33:01.136
Blair?

33:02.804 --> 33:04.407
- [Chase] Fuck!
- [Blair] Chase.

33:05.339 --> 33:06.305
[Blair groans]

33:06.307 --> 33:08.607
[Chase] Baby?
Okay, come here, come here.

33:08.609 --> 33:10.744
Sit up slowly, slow, slow, slow.
Take it easy.

33:10.746 --> 33:13.279
- Easy, easy, easy. Take it easy.
- [Blair groaning]

33:13.281 --> 33:14.748
Let me have a look.
Let me have a look.

33:14.750 --> 33:17.383
Oh, fuck. I gotta get you
to a hospital, baby.

33:17.385 --> 33:19.186
- What happened? What happened?
- They...

33:19.188 --> 33:20.890
- They...
- What? Huh?

33:21.722 --> 33:22.791
Micah...

33:23.892 --> 33:25.361
They took Micah.

33:25.928 --> 33:28.131
[Blair sobs]

33:32.834 --> 33:35.302
[siren blaring]

33:35.304 --> 33:38.771
[Chase] <i>I never did hospitals
too well.</i>

33:38.773 --> 33:40.940
<i>Not that I didn't have
the right ID's and papers</i>

33:40.942 --> 33:43.242
<i>to keep my nose clean.</i>

33:43.244 --> 33:45.147
<i>I just never had a reason
to be here.</i>

33:50.919 --> 33:52.251
[sighs]

33:52.253 --> 33:55.588
[Chase] <i>Professionally,
I never left anybody injured.</i>

33:55.590 --> 33:57.457
<i>If anything happened
to me personally, I...</i>

33:57.459 --> 33:59.327
<i>this would be
the last place I'd go.</i>

34:03.832 --> 34:05.334
You can come back
and see her now.

34:07.368 --> 34:10.737
[Chase] <i>I guess Blair was that
one exception for me being here.</i>

34:10.739 --> 34:13.373
<i>The sympathy card
came through for me.</i>

34:13.375 --> 34:15.407
<i>I'd rather be hunting
all of them down right now,</i>

34:15.409 --> 34:16.641
<i>than playing husband.</i>

34:16.643 --> 34:20.847
<i>But in this case,
I needed answers, and fast.</i>

34:20.849 --> 34:22.451
You look worse than I do.

34:24.286 --> 34:26.286
Babe, you know
I'm gonna ask you, right?

34:26.288 --> 34:27.521
And we don't have much time.

34:27.523 --> 34:30.757
And it's only gonna help get me
to Micah faster, all right?

34:30.759 --> 34:31.960
[Chase] You're gonna have
to tell me everything.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.666
There were two of them.
[sighs]

34:39.400 --> 34:41.699
It all happened so fast.

34:41.702 --> 34:42.871
Did you see
what they looked like?

34:45.373 --> 34:46.908
I was half asleep
when they came in.

34:48.876 --> 34:51.411
I was totally disoriented.

34:51.413 --> 34:54.447
They, they rushed me, and they,
they pointed my head down

34:54.449 --> 34:55.581
and they told me
that they'd kill me

34:55.583 --> 34:56.983
if I looked up at them.

34:56.985 --> 34:58.450
Did you recognize their voices?

34:58.452 --> 35:00.989
I mean, anything?
Did it sound like Miles?

35:03.724 --> 35:05.724
You really think he would do
something like this?

35:05.726 --> 35:08.327
I wouldn't have thought so
before, but...

35:08.329 --> 35:10.863
all options
are on the table now.

35:10.865 --> 35:12.367
Did either of them
sound like him?

35:13.601 --> 35:16.836
No, it was a man
and a woman, I think.

35:16.838 --> 35:17.974
[Blair] That's what
it sounded like.

35:20.309 --> 35:21.508
The guy pinned me down,

35:21.510 --> 35:22.909
and he pushed my face
to the side

35:22.911 --> 35:24.512
so I couldn't
look straight up at him.

35:25.380 --> 35:26.278
[Chase sighs]

35:26.280 --> 35:27.780
I clocked the fucker
in the face once,

35:27.782 --> 35:29.749
but he only
pinned me down harder.

35:29.751 --> 35:31.717
[Blair sighs]

35:31.719 --> 35:33.655
[Blair] Gave me a couple
of cracks to knock me out.

35:35.523 --> 35:37.557
All I remember is the other one
just kept laughing

35:37.559 --> 35:38.894
the whole time while he did it.

35:41.862 --> 35:45.000
And then they stormed out
and I heard a door open.

35:46.034 --> 35:48.804
And I heard murmured screams...

35:49.871 --> 35:51.407
from Micah getting dragged out.

35:52.940 --> 35:54.606
[sighs]
[Blair] I tried my hardest,

35:54.608 --> 35:56.642
I tried to crawl out there,
and I tried to do something,

35:56.644 --> 35:57.943
but I was too weak,
and then you came.

35:57.945 --> 35:59.545
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

35:59.547 --> 36:00.715
You don't have to go on, okay?

36:01.583 --> 36:02.715
I got everything I need.

36:02.717 --> 36:05.385
No one's gonna hurt you anymore.
No one, you got that?

36:05.387 --> 36:06.622
I'm gonna take care of this.

36:08.757 --> 36:10.559
I need you to do
two things for me.

36:10.958 --> 36:12.092
What?

36:12.094 --> 36:13.695
First, I need you to find Micah.

36:16.797 --> 36:18.366
And then I need you
to kill them.

36:21.902 --> 36:22.904
All of them.

36:25.373 --> 36:26.375
Done.

36:27.509 --> 36:28.575
I'm gonna be back
in a little bit

36:28.577 --> 36:30.075
to check on you, all right?

36:30.077 --> 36:31.978
Just don't tell the cops
anything. Nothing, all right?

36:31.980 --> 36:34.012
Make up something
about the bruises, all right?

36:34.014 --> 36:35.447
- Yeah?
- Okay.

36:35.449 --> 36:36.849
I'm on it.

36:36.851 --> 36:39.952
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

36:39.954 --> 36:41.590
It'll be over
before you know it.

36:53.001 --> 36:54.767
[Chase] <i>I guess more of me
rubbed off on Blair</i>

36:54.769 --> 36:56.135
<i>than I thought.</i>

36:56.137 --> 36:58.405
<i>She wanted all of them killed.</i>

36:58.407 --> 37:02.708
<i>No long drawn out justice,
just did in.</i>

37:02.710 --> 37:05.612
<i>Now most people would just want
to cut the head off,</i>

37:05.614 --> 37:06.746
<i>'cause that's where
the source is,</i>

37:06.748 --> 37:07.849
<i>and it would end.</i>

37:09.617 --> 37:11.885
<i>But I'm going
for all of the limbs,</i>

37:11.887 --> 37:13.952
<i>every last one.</i>

37:13.954 --> 37:15.990
<i>And I know exactly
where to start.</i>

37:18.059 --> 37:19.159
[Jessie] <i>You ready for this?</i>

37:19.161 --> 37:20.592
- <i>Ready?</i>
- [Burke] <i>Yeah!</i>

37:20.594 --> 37:23.061
- [Burke chuckles]
- [indistinct chatter]

37:23.063 --> 37:24.130
[Edson] <i>Get the fuck outta here!</i>

37:24.132 --> 37:25.898
[Hector] <i>Hey, you won!
This is funny...</i>

37:25.900 --> 37:27.566
- [Edson] <i>Hey! Hey! Hey!</i>
- [Hector] What?

37:27.568 --> 37:28.901
[Edson] Don't touch
my fucking chips, man.

37:28.903 --> 37:30.036
You see that guy?

37:30.038 --> 37:31.704
[Jessie] He's a cheap ass
fucking guy.

37:31.706 --> 37:33.005
[Hector] Hey, man, I need,
I need some chips.

37:33.007 --> 37:34.773
- [Edson] <i>Que la verga, ey!</i>
- [Jessie] I won, I won anyway.

37:34.775 --> 37:35.842
Fucking two pair.

37:35.844 --> 37:37.075
What's up? What's up, bitches!

37:37.077 --> 37:39.211
Two pair? No, no, no.

37:39.213 --> 37:40.646
- You lose!
- Ah!

37:40.648 --> 37:42.148
Do you see these cards?

37:42.150 --> 37:44.117
- You be cheating, Hector.
- [Franco] Get outta here.

37:44.119 --> 37:45.217
I got something better, Hector.

37:45.219 --> 37:46.286
[Franco] Whatcha got?
Whatcha got?

37:46.288 --> 37:48.054
- [Hector] Where is it?
- [Edson] Well, watch this.

37:48.056 --> 37:50.623
- Flush, what's up?
- That's not bad.

37:50.625 --> 37:52.559
- That's not bad.
- Whatcha got, Burke?

37:52.561 --> 37:54.526
- It's all right.
- [Jessie laughing]

37:54.528 --> 37:55.628
Hey, you ready for this?

37:55.630 --> 37:57.664
- Are you ready for this?
- [Hector] What's up, Burke?

37:57.666 --> 37:58.998
Full House, bitches.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.934
[all groaning]

38:00.936 --> 38:02.969
[overlapping chatter]

38:02.971 --> 38:04.704
[Jessie]
You're all fucking cheating.

38:04.706 --> 38:07.039
Hey, Franco,
can you go get some beers?

38:07.041 --> 38:08.974
Hey, hey, hey. Franco, Franco,
before you go, man.

38:08.976 --> 38:10.846
- What's up?
- Be fucking honest with me.

38:12.079 --> 38:14.813
Does Burke
look like a girl to you?

38:14.815 --> 38:16.081
- Of course, he does.
- [all laughing]

38:16.083 --> 38:17.150
[Franco] Look at him.

38:17.152 --> 38:18.751
Oh, yeah, shopping at Baby Gap.

38:18.753 --> 38:19.751
[all laughing]

38:19.753 --> 38:21.688
- Get the fuck outta here!
- Good one, Franco.

38:21.690 --> 38:22.992
[Jessie] Oh! It's party time.

38:33.902 --> 38:35.003
[gasps, groans]

38:38.773 --> 38:39.775
[Chase grunts]

38:46.882 --> 38:48.584
- [choking]
- [Chase grunting]

38:58.193 --> 38:59.226
[Hector] Hey, Burke! Hey, Burke!

38:59.228 --> 39:01.094
Your little sister called,
she wants her shirt.

39:01.096 --> 39:02.229
What's wrong with my shirt?

39:02.231 --> 39:04.731
It looks like my shirt,
you're fucking stealing my shit!

39:04.733 --> 39:06.132
I was about to say that, Jess.

39:06.134 --> 39:07.266
It doesn't fit you,
so it's clearly mine.

39:07.268 --> 39:08.635
Oh, fuck you, guys.

39:08.637 --> 39:09.536
Besides, it doesn't matter.

39:09.538 --> 39:11.871
Because look
at this excessive injury.

39:11.873 --> 39:13.740
[Edson] Who stabbed you, Burke?
Who stabbed you, man?

39:13.742 --> 39:15.041
You know what, Burke,
use your other hand

39:15.043 --> 39:16.208
and start jerking off
like you always do.

39:16.210 --> 39:17.911
- [Hector] Yeah!
- [Burke] Fuck you, guys.

39:17.913 --> 39:19.311
Who needs it anyways?
Lola got me.

39:19.313 --> 39:21.113
- [Jessie] Sure!
- Oh, sure!

39:21.115 --> 39:22.615
- Right!
- Yeah.

39:22.617 --> 39:23.849
[Jessie] You know what,
every time we see you,

39:23.851 --> 39:24.717
you're more fucked up.

39:24.719 --> 39:25.651
- [Jessie] What is this?
- Hey. Hey, hey.

39:25.653 --> 39:27.287
- What is this shit?
- Watch it, watch it,

39:27.289 --> 39:28.820
it's liability, it's the job.

39:28.822 --> 39:30.023
[Hector] What... why,
when Lola comes around

39:30.025 --> 39:31.224
and she don't look like that,
you do?

39:31.226 --> 39:32.592
- [Jessie] Right.
- She's kicking your ass!

39:32.594 --> 39:34.059
- [laughs]
- Yeah, you know what, Burke?

39:34.061 --> 39:36.128
your girl got her shit together
more than you.

39:36.130 --> 39:37.764
Hey, you know what?
Fuck all, y'all, like,

39:37.766 --> 39:39.132
these are battle wounds,
bitches,

39:39.134 --> 39:40.233
- where's yours at?
- Battles?

39:40.235 --> 39:41.333
Ah, we know how to do our job.

39:41.335 --> 39:42.401
- That's right.
- No one else got 'em.

39:42.403 --> 39:44.137
No battle wounds on us,
except this battle wound.

39:44.139 --> 39:45.671
[laughs]

39:45.673 --> 39:46.805
Hey, you know what,
I gotta use the shitter.

39:46.807 --> 39:48.106
Fuck!
We're in the middle of a hand.

39:48.108 --> 39:50.677
What? I gotta take a shit,
man, sorry.

39:50.679 --> 39:52.211
No wonder you smell
like shit, bro.

39:52.213 --> 39:53.679
[Hector] <i>Que la chingada,
cabron!</i>

39:53.681 --> 39:55.682
Watch that man, jigsaw.

39:55.684 --> 39:56.916
[Burke] Don't make
a fucking mess in there.

39:56.918 --> 39:57.816
- [Hector] Fuck you!
- [Jessie] The only one

39:57.818 --> 39:59.184
with a mess, is you.
Look at this shit.

39:59.186 --> 40:00.188
[scoffs]

40:13.902 --> 40:15.938
[grunting]

40:16.804 --> 40:17.972
Oh, fuck!

40:19.007 --> 40:20.041
[sighs deeply]

40:20.942 --> 40:21.943
[grunts]

40:23.677 --> 40:24.712
[sighs]

40:25.213 --> 40:26.612
Damn it!

40:26.614 --> 40:27.849
[grunts]

40:35.389 --> 40:37.692
- [lid slams]
- [grunts]

40:45.634 --> 40:47.635
- [Chase grunting]
- [muffled gunshots]

40:53.108 --> 40:56.178
[toilet flushes]

41:00.148 --> 41:02.749
No, No, No. Burke, Jessie,
fuck the bullshit.

41:02.751 --> 41:04.751
I'm going in, you know what?
'Cause I gotta fucking piss.

41:04.753 --> 41:06.385
And Hector's taking too much
of a long shit.

41:06.387 --> 41:07.787
Brilliant play, you know.

41:07.789 --> 41:09.021
And did you even see
what that guy ate?

41:09.023 --> 41:10.657
- Who? Shithead?
- [Jessie] Yeah.

41:10.659 --> 41:11.724
- No.
- [Jessie laughs]

41:11.726 --> 41:12.992
I feel sorry
for that toilet, though.

41:12.994 --> 41:15.193
- [Jessie] Bruh!
- I'll have you clean it, cabron.

41:15.195 --> 41:17.329
<i>Cabrón. Cabrón.</i>
Fucking white boy.

41:17.331 --> 41:18.965
What's the difference?
Oh, my god.

41:18.967 --> 41:20.066
[Edson] "What's the difference?"

41:20.068 --> 41:22.071
Yo, Hector, what are you doing
to my shitter, man?

41:25.873 --> 41:28.007
- [Edson] Well, go help him.
- You go check it out.

41:28.009 --> 41:29.075
[Jessie] Dude,
what the fuck, man?

41:29.077 --> 41:30.110
What, why me, <i>puto?</i>

41:30.112 --> 41:31.713
'Cause you're the first one
who brought it up.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.947
- Well get up, <i>puto!</i>
- Fuck you, Burke.

41:34.949 --> 41:36.215
[Jessie] That sucks, man.
You better arm your shit.

41:36.217 --> 41:37.316
[Burke] Get up!

41:37.318 --> 41:38.284
[Edson] I'm gonna call him.

41:38.286 --> 41:39.885
- Hey, Hector?
- [Jessie] I took your money.

41:39.887 --> 41:40.952
[Edson] Hector, what's up man?

41:40.954 --> 41:42.021
- [gunshot]
- [Edson groans]

41:42.023 --> 41:43.088
[gunshot]

41:43.090 --> 41:44.192
- [thwacks]
- [Chase grunts]

41:44.858 --> 41:45.893
[gunshot]

41:47.094 --> 41:48.262
- [Chase grunts]
- [thuds, clatters]

41:49.364 --> 41:51.367
[action music]

41:53.967 --> 41:55.133
[thuds]

41:55.135 --> 41:57.202
[panting]

41:57.204 --> 41:58.840
[Chase] Don't even
think about it.

41:59.940 --> 42:01.409
[panting]

42:02.911 --> 42:03.912
C'mon, honey.

42:05.012 --> 42:06.382
I know you won't clip me.

42:08.882 --> 42:10.418
[Jessie] Not after all
we've been through.

42:12.219 --> 42:13.221
Huh?

42:18.059 --> 42:19.061
Did you, uh...

42:20.260 --> 42:22.795
You ever tell Blair about us?

42:22.797 --> 42:23.965
[Jessie] You know, that...

42:25.365 --> 42:27.201
one little slip you had?

42:28.202 --> 42:29.338
[snickers]

42:33.842 --> 42:34.910
You know...

42:36.277 --> 42:37.445
we could, um...

42:38.413 --> 42:39.715
we could have another.

42:40.914 --> 42:42.280
You can decide.

42:42.282 --> 42:43.349
I wouldn't tell.

42:43.351 --> 42:44.920
- [gunshots]
- [body thuds]

42:45.420 --> 42:46.519
Neither will I.

42:46.521 --> 42:48.820
You fucking cocksucker!

42:48.822 --> 42:50.058
[Burke groans]

42:50.525 --> 42:51.791
[Chase] Really?

42:51.793 --> 42:53.992
Burkey, Burkey, Burkey.

42:53.994 --> 42:55.461
[Chase] I always knew
you were a dumbass motherfucker,

42:55.463 --> 42:56.996
but really?

42:56.998 --> 42:58.231
Huh? Going after my own?

42:58.233 --> 42:59.831
'Cause Miles put you up to it?

42:59.833 --> 43:01.166
Who says Miles
put me up to anything?

43:01.168 --> 43:03.202
[Chase] Ah, c'mon, man!

43:03.204 --> 43:04.871
Everyone knows
you're too fucking stupid

43:04.873 --> 43:06.405
to pull anything off
like that yourself.

43:06.407 --> 43:07.472
Huh?

43:07.474 --> 43:08.541
And how about this, huh?

43:08.543 --> 43:10.108
What's this? A fucking pimple?

43:10.110 --> 43:12.177
[Chase] Lola during foreplay?

43:12.179 --> 43:14.112
Everyone knows Lola
has bigger balls than you.

43:14.114 --> 43:16.115
Hey, fuck you!

43:16.117 --> 43:17.916
Why don't you just
get it over with, you bitch?

43:17.918 --> 43:19.017
Oh, it's gonna happen.

43:19.019 --> 43:20.086
Don't worry.

43:20.088 --> 43:21.153
I mean, the question is,

43:21.155 --> 43:22.354
if it's gonna be fast
and painless

43:22.356 --> 43:24.791
or slow and agonizing?

43:24.793 --> 43:26.361
It's really all up to you, yeah?

43:27.494 --> 43:28.427
[groaning]

43:28.429 --> 43:30.329
How about we do
a little Q and A session?

43:30.331 --> 43:31.563
How about that, yeah?

43:31.565 --> 43:33.231
- If it goes nice and easy...
- [Burke sighs]

43:33.233 --> 43:34.833
...I'm fine.

43:34.835 --> 43:35.769
If it doesn't,

43:35.771 --> 43:38.104
we're gonna have
my little version of fun.

43:38.106 --> 43:40.505
[Chase] I got all the time
in the world.

43:40.507 --> 43:43.208
I wouldn't say that,
with Micah gone and all.

43:43.210 --> 43:45.510
- [gunshot]
- [Burke] Ah! Fuck!

43:45.512 --> 43:47.045
See, I didn't like that.

43:47.047 --> 43:48.581
Did I, huh? Huh?

43:48.583 --> 43:50.048
[Burke] Ah, shit!

43:50.050 --> 43:51.818
But let me make something clear.

43:51.820 --> 43:52.952
If I don't like something,

43:52.954 --> 43:55.420
I'm gonna make damn sure
you don't like something either.

43:55.422 --> 43:57.923
And we can go back and forth,
back and forth,

43:57.925 --> 44:01.059
but I promise you,
I'm winning the fucking game.

44:01.061 --> 44:02.494
What do you want to know?

44:02.496 --> 44:03.996
Three things.

44:03.998 --> 44:06.865
Where's Micah, where's Miles...

44:06.867 --> 44:08.501
and where's Lola?
If we have time.

44:08.503 --> 44:11.037
Don't you fucking touch Lola,
you dickweed!

44:11.039 --> 44:13.271
[Chase chuckles]

44:13.273 --> 44:15.173
- Swing and miss with that one!
- [thwacks]

44:15.175 --> 44:17.043
- [Burke] Ah!
- Huh?

44:17.045 --> 44:18.177
I'd be more concerned

44:18.179 --> 44:20.045
about what's gonna happen
to you, bitch.

44:20.047 --> 44:22.315
You wanna try answering
the other two?

44:22.317 --> 44:24.385
[chuckles]

44:25.085 --> 44:26.885
You know what?

44:26.887 --> 44:29.088
You can go fuck yourself, Chase!

44:29.090 --> 44:30.623
[Burke] Yeah, that's right.

44:30.625 --> 44:33.124
I'm sick of being pushed around

44:33.126 --> 44:34.626
- by you, by Miles.
- Oh.

44:34.628 --> 44:37.028
[Burke] You can go
fuck yourself, asshole!

44:37.030 --> 44:39.134
Do your worst!
I ain't telling you shit!

44:39.500 --> 44:41.200
[pants]

44:41.202 --> 44:42.538
What are you doing, man?

44:44.072 --> 44:45.874
What the hell
are you doing in there?

44:50.110 --> 44:51.177
[tapping]

44:51.179 --> 44:53.144
[Burke] Fuck, what the hell
are you doing, man?

44:53.146 --> 44:55.581
Don't make me shit my pants.
That's too much, man.

44:55.583 --> 44:57.148
[snickers]
[Chase] I won't.

44:57.150 --> 44:59.221
But let me explain how
I'm gonna use this little thing.

45:00.221 --> 45:01.220
See, if you take this,

45:01.222 --> 45:02.655
and you put it
just underneath the fingernail,

45:02.657 --> 45:03.822
just like that,

45:03.824 --> 45:07.159
and you tap it at the end
with a little bit of force,

45:07.161 --> 45:08.994
like a hammer.

45:08.996 --> 45:10.965
You'd be surprised
how easily it slips off.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.034
Almost seamless.

45:14.135 --> 45:16.302
Quite painful for you, though.

45:16.304 --> 45:18.537
I mean, mind you,
it's nothing compared

45:18.539 --> 45:21.307
to the pain index
of the toenails.

45:21.309 --> 45:23.075
It'll have you begging
to all things holy,

45:23.077 --> 45:24.943
and wanting to do
just about anything else,

45:24.945 --> 45:26.047
but that.

45:27.414 --> 45:30.282
Well, let's have a go then,
shall we?

45:30.284 --> 45:32.418
[Burke panting]

45:32.420 --> 45:35.420
[Burke] Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off me!

45:35.422 --> 45:36.625
[Burke screams]

45:50.038 --> 45:52.604
[Chase] <i>Burke held up
better than I thought,</i>

45:52.606 --> 45:55.508
<i>but I got most of the info
I needed from him.</i>

45:55.510 --> 45:57.108
<i>I mean, not all, of course,</i>

45:57.110 --> 45:58.543
<i>'cause Miles
is smarter than that</i>

45:58.545 --> 46:00.448
<i>and wouldn't tell that asshat
just anything.</i>

46:02.349 --> 46:04.483
<i>I mean, the only thing
fucking with me right now,</i>

46:04.485 --> 46:07.019
<i>was that Miles knew me so well.</i>

46:07.021 --> 46:09.487
<i>He would anticipate my moves.</i>

46:09.489 --> 46:10.524
<i>Luckily for me, though,</i>

46:11.693 --> 46:14.092
<i>I knew how he operated, too.</i>

46:14.094 --> 46:15.963
[cellphone buzzing]

46:20.201 --> 46:22.668
[Miles] <i>So how did I know you
was gonna go after Burke first?</i>

46:22.670 --> 46:23.836
Why are you doing this?

46:23.838 --> 46:26.338
[Miles] <i>Actually,
I should be thanking you, Chase.</i>

46:26.340 --> 46:27.407
<i>You did me a solid.</i>

46:27.409 --> 46:29.342
<i>I don't even like
that motherfucker.</i>

46:29.344 --> 46:31.543
So, who's next? Lola?

46:31.545 --> 46:32.614
Gibson?

46:33.313 --> 46:34.380
Me?

46:34.382 --> 46:37.383
Nah, that ain't your style.

46:37.385 --> 46:39.485
[Miles] <i>You like to work
your way up from the bottom.</i>

46:39.487 --> 46:41.519
<i>Besides it don't make much sense
to eat the dessert</i>

46:41.521 --> 46:43.521
<i>if you ain't tackled
the main meal yet, right?</i>

46:43.523 --> 46:45.090
Why now? Hmm?

46:45.092 --> 46:46.659
After all the shit
we've been through, huh?

46:46.661 --> 46:48.293
Why try to take me down now?

46:48.295 --> 46:49.427
Take you down?

46:49.429 --> 46:51.530
Shit. To the contrary, baby.

46:51.532 --> 46:53.231
Correct you, maybe.

46:53.233 --> 46:55.668
But take you down?
Oh, no, no, no.

46:55.670 --> 46:57.769
[Miles] <i>See, Chase, you're one
of the best to ever do it.</i>

46:57.771 --> 47:00.206
<i>Besides, if I wanted
to take you down,</i>

47:00.208 --> 47:02.575
<i>I'd have put a hit on your ass
that night after the job.</i>

47:02.577 --> 47:03.709
Well, what the fuck
does that mean?

47:03.711 --> 47:05.378
[Miles] <i>To show you,
you don't need them.</i>

47:05.380 --> 47:06.412
Who?

47:06.414 --> 47:08.546
[Miles] <i>The girl
and the kid, nigga.</i>

47:08.548 --> 47:11.217
I'll fucking kill you, Miles,
you fucking asshole!

47:11.219 --> 47:12.650
See, man,
that's that emotional bullshit

47:12.652 --> 47:14.119
I'm talking about, man.

47:14.121 --> 47:16.255
C'mon with that whiny shit.

47:16.257 --> 47:17.456
<i>Look, I need you to go back
to being a cold,</i>

47:17.458 --> 47:19.391
<i>careless motherfucker
that I know you to be.</i>

47:19.393 --> 47:20.728
[sighs deeply]
It's not me anymore.

47:21.528 --> 47:23.429
Oh, but you will be.

47:23.431 --> 47:25.097
[Chase] <i>What the fuck
do you mean by that?</i>

47:25.099 --> 47:27.666
Yeah, Micah is turning
into a real Picasso right now.

47:27.668 --> 47:28.733
[chuckles]

47:28.735 --> 47:30.802
I think he gets it
from his mother.

47:30.804 --> 47:31.737
Actually you know what,
scratch that,

47:31.739 --> 47:34.305
the way he plays it safely
in the lines...

47:34.307 --> 47:35.710
<i>I know he gets it
from his daddy.</i>

47:36.510 --> 47:37.545
He's with you right now?

47:38.311 --> 47:39.677
Oh, yeah.

47:39.679 --> 47:42.148
We're actually having a little
bit of a ball right now.

47:42.150 --> 47:43.585
Micah is coloring his ass off.

47:45.219 --> 47:46.251
[chuckles]

47:46.253 --> 47:48.086
He's starting to feel like
a fucking son to me.

47:48.088 --> 47:49.554
I'm gonna fucking
kill you, Miles.

47:49.556 --> 47:51.757
I'm telling you that right now.

47:51.759 --> 47:54.726
[inhales deeply]
That's a negative, Chase.

47:54.728 --> 47:55.762
See, the only thing Micah wants

47:55.764 --> 47:58.363
is for his parents
to come home from vacation.

47:58.365 --> 48:00.532
[Miles] <i>Now, how long
you stay on that vacation,</i>

48:00.534 --> 48:03.101
<i>that's entirely up to you,
brother.</i>

48:03.103 --> 48:04.438
What the fuck
do you want from me?

48:05.505 --> 48:08.340
What do I want from you?
[chuckles]

48:08.342 --> 48:10.412
What do I want from you?
What do I want from you?

48:11.411 --> 48:12.510
I want you to leave them.

48:12.512 --> 48:14.345
[Miles] <i>I want you
to leave them both.</i>

48:14.347 --> 48:15.780
<i>Look, Micah and Blair
can reunite</i>

48:15.782 --> 48:18.650
<i>and move wherever the fuck
they wanna move.</i>

48:18.652 --> 48:21.487
<i>But I want my Chase
where I can see him.</i>

48:21.489 --> 48:24.291
I want the real Chase,
no distractions.

48:25.592 --> 48:28.193
What the fuck
is your deal, Miles? Huh?

48:28.195 --> 48:30.862
I mean, what the fuck
is your problem?

48:30.864 --> 48:32.764
I mean, do you have a fucking
hard-on for me or something?

48:32.766 --> 48:33.800
Is that what it is?

48:33.802 --> 48:36.168
It's never affected
my fucking work, not once.

48:36.170 --> 48:37.436
They're fucking separate.

48:37.438 --> 48:40.238
I mean you're the one who turned
this fucking shit upside down.

48:40.240 --> 48:42.874
[Miles] <i>Look, Chase, I like
to keep my investment in check.</i>

48:42.876 --> 48:45.577
I told you, the people
that make it in this business

48:45.579 --> 48:48.347
are the ones epithetic to know
what's going on around them.

48:48.349 --> 48:50.483
That's the job.

48:50.485 --> 48:53.251
Chase, look, man, you want
to get your dick wet? Hm?

48:53.253 --> 48:55.153
You want to fuck hoes
every other night?

48:55.155 --> 48:56.354
You have at it.

48:56.356 --> 48:58.190
[Miles] <i>But I know
this catching emotion shit</i>

48:58.192 --> 48:59.258
<i>and trying to keep it moving,</i>

48:59.260 --> 49:00.726
<i>that's what's fucking with you.</i>

49:00.728 --> 49:02.827
<i>When you stop to think about it,</i>

49:02.829 --> 49:04.465
<i>I'm actually doing you a solid.</i>

49:07.534 --> 49:09.237
[sighs deeply]

49:12.840 --> 49:14.273
One day.

49:14.275 --> 49:15.340
[Miles] <i>Pardon me?</i>

49:15.342 --> 49:16.407
Give me one day,

49:16.409 --> 49:17.809
and I'll think about
all of this.

49:17.811 --> 49:20.179
In the meantime,
you don't fucking touch Micah.

49:20.181 --> 49:22.581
And I mean not at all.

49:22.583 --> 49:26.151
If I fucking sense any
of your fucking dogs hunting him

49:26.153 --> 49:27.519
or Blair or me for that matter,

49:27.521 --> 49:28.686
I'm gonna fucking come to you,

49:28.688 --> 49:30.389
and I'm gonna fucking
fuck you up

49:30.391 --> 49:32.490
like you've never been
fucked up before, you got that?

49:32.492 --> 49:33.661
[chuckles]

49:34.327 --> 49:35.329
Cool.

49:35.862 --> 49:37.630
But know this,

49:37.632 --> 49:40.432
you break off any more branches
on my operation,

49:40.434 --> 49:42.735
I'm gonna make sure Micah
turns into an orphan.

49:42.737 --> 49:45.436
[Miles] <i>Real fucking quick.</i>

49:45.438 --> 49:46.875
<i>I'm not afraid to die, Chase.</i>

49:47.842 --> 49:48.844
Are you?

49:52.346 --> 49:53.414
[cellphone clanks]

49:55.382 --> 49:57.685
[engine starts, revs]

50:00.521 --> 50:01.619
[thuds]

50:01.621 --> 50:02.623
[sighs]

50:06.360 --> 50:08.363
[approaching footsteps]

50:15.369 --> 50:17.172
[Sergey] I thought you could use
another one.

50:17.771 --> 50:19.871
Thanks.

50:19.873 --> 50:21.907
[Miles] Burke
didn't make it back, did he?

50:21.909 --> 50:24.476
[Sergey] Died en route.

50:24.478 --> 50:26.847
Apparently, Chase, uh,
really did a number on him.

50:28.449 --> 50:31.217
Well, shit, man. You know Chase.

50:31.219 --> 50:33.818
Hell, I wouldn't expect
anything less.

50:33.820 --> 50:35.920
You know, Lola and Burke
actually sent some meth heads

50:35.922 --> 50:37.555
over there
for Chase to take out.

50:37.557 --> 50:38.856
[chuckles]

50:38.858 --> 50:40.592
Cheers, Burke.

50:40.594 --> 50:42.297
Stupid motherfucker.

50:44.898 --> 50:46.768
Ah. And cheers to the living.

50:47.735 --> 50:48.800
[glasses clink]

50:48.802 --> 50:49.871
<i>Nostrovia.</i>

50:55.009 --> 50:57.008
[clicks tongue]

50:57.010 --> 51:00.345
Do you really think
he's going to give it all up,

51:00.347 --> 51:01.583
and do what you want?

51:02.315 --> 51:03.551
Nah, not at all.

51:05.018 --> 51:06.854
Then, what are we going to do?

51:09.422 --> 51:10.623
Nothing.

51:10.625 --> 51:12.958
This next move right here,
is Chase's move.

51:12.960 --> 51:15.429
I can think of a few things
to help expedite the choices.

51:16.297 --> 51:17.695
Does Lola know?

51:17.697 --> 51:19.867
[scoffs]
Hey, Serg, do me a favor.

51:21.268 --> 51:23.668
Next time,
bring me a White Russian.

51:23.670 --> 51:24.737
[glass thuds]

51:24.739 --> 51:26.240
[chuckles]

51:32.346 --> 51:33.811
[liquor sloshing]

51:33.813 --> 51:35.748
Speaking of which,
how's this Gomez shit going?

51:35.750 --> 51:37.351
I've been working on him
all day.

51:38.585 --> 51:39.653
He finally talked.

51:40.954 --> 51:42.720
Want me to let him go?

51:42.722 --> 51:44.523
After all them hours?

51:44.525 --> 51:46.360
Man, fuck that.
Bring his ass in here.

52:00.074 --> 52:02.476
[Gomez groaning]

52:06.547 --> 52:07.548
[thuds]

52:08.548 --> 52:09.918
Here's what's left of him.

52:10.751 --> 52:13.686
Goddamn, Serg!

52:13.688 --> 52:15.824
Shit. You put the paws
on that nigga.

52:19.360 --> 52:21.492
You told me to tune him up.

52:21.494 --> 52:22.894
What the fuck
you waiting on, then?

52:22.896 --> 52:26.432
[in Russian accent] Put that
Soviet power to good use.

52:26.434 --> 52:27.902
[Miles] Make that motherfucker
meet God.

52:29.969 --> 52:32.506
[thudding]

52:33.873 --> 52:35.574
[Sergey grunting]

[thudding]

52:38.679 --> 52:39.947
[screams]

52:46.653 --> 52:49.023
Oh, I bet you they wished
they'd built that wall now.

53:12.913 --> 53:14.713
Where's my boy, Chase?

53:14.715 --> 53:16.985
Our boy is coming home soon.
I'm on it.

53:18.152 --> 53:19.418
I don't like that answer.

53:19.420 --> 53:20.688
Well, what am I supposed to say?

53:25.760 --> 53:27.528
I want you to answer me
honestly, okay?

53:31.998 --> 53:34.335
Were you doing a hit for Miles
the night I was attacked?

53:46.780 --> 53:48.449
You're never gonna change,
are you?

53:51.619 --> 53:53.588
Not for me, not for Micah.

53:56.090 --> 53:57.822
It's never gonna end, is it?

53:57.824 --> 53:58.826
[blinkers beeping]

53:59.994 --> 54:01.092
I don't know.
[sighs]

54:01.094 --> 54:02.363
[Blair scoffs]

54:07.768 --> 54:09.601
[Chase] <i>If there's one thing
that's harder</i>

54:09.603 --> 54:11.670
<i>than sleeping in general for me,</i>

54:11.672 --> 54:14.505
<i>it's sleeping
on a flimsy ass couch.</i>

54:14.507 --> 54:17.775
<i>I guess Blair was in her right
to banish me downstairs anyway.</i>

54:17.777 --> 54:18.976
[groans]

54:18.978 --> 54:20.845
[Chase] <i>The only reason
why I'm not out there</i>

54:20.847 --> 54:23.014
<i>fucking up Miles'
whole operation right now,</i>

54:23.016 --> 54:25.050
<i>is 'cause I'm trying
to keep my word for a change.</i>

54:25.052 --> 54:27.485
<i>And see if he keeps his.</i>

54:27.487 --> 54:31.155
<i>Maybe he was right after all,
this life isn't for a family.</i>

54:31.157 --> 54:32.858
<i>Maybe in a weird way,</i>

54:32.860 --> 54:35.526
<i>he was trying
to help me all along.</i>

54:35.528 --> 54:38.400
<i>And Blair and Micah
would be better off without me.</i>

54:39.934 --> 54:42.099
[sighs]

54:42.101 --> 54:45.003
<i>Sometimes I have so much
insomnia,</i>

54:45.005 --> 54:47.709
<i>I can't tell whether
I'm actually sleeping or awake.</i>

- [muffled scream]

54:58.918 --> 55:00.922
[foreboding music]

55:19.005 --> 55:20.040
Blair?

55:39.025 --> 55:40.958
Blair?

55:40.960 --> 55:43.161
- [thwacks]
- [Chase] Ah! Fuck!

55:43.163 --> 55:44.164
Shit!

55:45.132 --> 55:46.164
[Chase] <i>You see here,</i>

55:46.166 --> 55:48.300
<i>this is where I knew
I was fucked.</i>

55:48.302 --> 55:49.834
Shit!

55:49.836 --> 55:52.237
Ah, fuck me!
[groans]

55:52.239 --> 55:54.773
That was just
to get your attention.

55:54.775 --> 55:57.943
Not a bad throw for doing that
while I hold your bitch, huh?

55:57.945 --> 56:00.112
[Chase groans]

56:00.114 --> 56:01.612
Miles sent you, huh?

56:01.614 --> 56:02.880
[Lola] He didn't need to.

56:02.882 --> 56:04.615
All he did was tell me
what you did to Burke,

56:04.617 --> 56:06.717
and I volunteered.

56:06.719 --> 56:07.920
- [Blair groans]
- Careful, bitch.

56:07.922 --> 56:09.253
You don't want me to slip.

56:09.255 --> 56:10.923
[Chase] Come on, Lola, please.

56:10.925 --> 56:12.257
Just let her go.

56:12.259 --> 56:14.592
I'm telling you.
Miles is playing all of us.

56:14.594 --> 56:16.128
[Chase] And his goal is for all
of us to kill each other

56:16.130 --> 56:17.628
so he can clean house.

56:17.630 --> 56:19.331
You know
he's calculated like that.

56:19.333 --> 56:21.900
You knew these chain of events
would play out like this.

56:21.902 --> 56:23.938
So, what? You kill Burke
and I'm just supposed to eat it?

56:25.139 --> 56:27.072
- [Blair whimpers]
- No.

56:27.074 --> 56:29.110
Look, how about
we swinger this shit? Huh?

56:29.842 --> 56:31.610
You do my man,

56:31.612 --> 56:34.211
I do your woman.

56:34.213 --> 56:36.914
Careful Chase, I'm serious,
don't take another fucking step.

56:36.916 --> 56:38.717
You're smarter than this.

56:38.719 --> 56:40.952
I know Burke
put you up to all of this.

56:40.954 --> 56:43.287
[Chase] He always just thought
with his little trigger finger.

56:43.289 --> 56:44.755
That's why I went for him
and not you.

56:44.757 --> 56:46.358
Come on, man, Miles has my kid.

56:46.360 --> 56:47.959
That's all I want right now.

56:47.961 --> 56:50.061
[Chase] I don't want to end
this shit in a firefight.

56:50.063 --> 56:51.598
It's already gone too far.

56:52.231 --> 56:53.298
Here.

56:53.300 --> 56:54.266
You see the knife?

56:54.268 --> 56:57.034
- [knife clanks]
- [Chase] There you go, okay?

56:57.036 --> 56:58.704
You let her go,
you walk out of here,

56:58.706 --> 56:59.804
we call it quits.

56:59.806 --> 57:01.940
I go over to Miles,
I square everything up with him.

57:01.942 --> 57:03.610
Nobody else has to die.

57:08.181 --> 57:09.182
No.

57:10.818 --> 57:13.054
- [thuds]
- [both grunt]

- [Chase groans]

[Lola groans]

57:35.976 --> 57:37.077
[Chase yells]

57:40.880 --> 57:43.382
How's that feel, big boy?

57:43.384 --> 57:45.950
You're not fucking
with Burke anymore, are you?

57:45.952 --> 57:49.121
But don't worry,
I'll take care of Micah.

57:49.123 --> 57:51.722
I'll take of Micah real good.

57:51.724 --> 57:52.960

[Chase] Hell of a shot, baby.

58:12.045 --> 58:14.112
[Chase groaning]

58:14.114 --> 58:15.213
- [Chase] Can you just...
- [Blair] Yeah.

58:15.215 --> 58:16.914
...prop the leg up?

58:16.916 --> 58:18.784
Ah, man, Fuck.
Watch out, watch out.

58:18.786 --> 58:20.251
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
- Okay, okay, okay.

58:20.253 --> 58:22.186
- Is that better?
- Okay, yeah. Yeah.

58:22.188 --> 58:23.790
Come on, now.
[sighs]

58:24.425 --> 58:25.691
Okay.

58:25.693 --> 58:26.925
We need to get you
to the hospital.

58:26.927 --> 58:28.126
- No.
- Okay, trust me.

58:28.128 --> 58:29.760
Trust me, no questions asked.

58:29.762 --> 58:30.829
We need get you some real help.

58:30.831 --> 58:31.697
We don't have time for that.

58:31.699 --> 58:33.798
We gotta get this settled now.
[grunts]

58:33.800 --> 58:35.900
By the time...
I get to the hospital,

58:35.902 --> 58:37.369
Micah will be dead.

58:37.371 --> 58:39.371
And Miles is gonna find out
sooner or later.

58:39.373 --> 58:42.773
- How?
- I don't know!

58:42.775 --> 58:44.108
He's always been ahead of me
my whole life,

58:44.110 --> 58:46.010
but he's gonna find out.

58:46.012 --> 58:47.414
I'm gonna have to end this now.

58:48.148 --> 58:49.914
[grunting]

58:49.916 --> 58:51.782
- Let me go with you.
- [Chase] No.

58:51.784 --> 58:53.053
There's too much at stake.

58:54.021 --> 58:55.256
[Blair] Chase.

58:56.724 --> 58:58.359
Bring our son back in one piece.

58:59.726 --> 59:00.927
That's the only way.

59:02.362 --> 59:03.398
I love you.

59:05.231 --> 59:06.300
I love you, too.

59:18.244 --> 59:20.248
[foreboding music]

59:32.391 --> 59:34.394
[foreboding music continues]

59:39.800 --> 59:41.166
Look, I want you
to keep an eye out for tonight,

59:41.168 --> 59:42.367
do you hear me?

59:42.369 --> 59:44.068
[scoffs]

59:44.070 --> 59:45.906
This shit can get real messy.

59:47.173 --> 59:48.273
Real soon.

59:48.275 --> 59:49.477
Will do, boss.

59:53.045 --> 59:53.979
[Miles] Oh, see I thought

59:53.981 --> 59:56.046
you were supposed to be
in bed, young man.

59:56.048 --> 59:57.449
See, we had a deal.

59:57.451 --> 59:59.550
You told me if I let you
do one more drawing,

59:59.552 --> 01:00:01.385
it was night-night for you.

01:00:01.387 --> 01:00:03.854
Are you a deal breaker? Hm?

01:00:03.856 --> 01:00:05.289
- You a deal breaker?
- Aw.

01:00:05.291 --> 01:00:07.458
But I wanna draw
another one in this.

01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:10.295
Okay. Well, hold on, let me see
what you're working with.

01:00:10.297 --> 01:00:12.396
Oh, look at that.
That's beautiful.

01:00:12.398 --> 01:00:14.800
- Hey, can I have that?
- No.

01:00:14.802 --> 01:00:16.934
- It's for Mommy and Daddy.
- [Miles sighs]

01:00:16.936 --> 01:00:18.436
Well, how about
the ones over there?

01:00:18.438 --> 01:00:21.472
No. They're all
for Mommy and Daddy.

01:00:21.474 --> 01:00:24.008
Oh, well, I gotta strong feeling

01:00:24.010 --> 01:00:26.278
you're gonna see Mommy
and Daddy real soon.

01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.482
Really? When?

01:00:28.315 --> 01:00:30.248
Most likely tonight.

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:31.918
Yeah? Both of them?

01:00:33.286 --> 01:00:35.086
Yeah, both of them.

01:00:35.088 --> 01:00:37.155
Well, look, I'm gonna need you
to do me a favor,

01:00:37.157 --> 01:00:38.222
no matter what happens,

01:00:38.224 --> 01:00:39.891
I want you
to remember something.

01:00:39.893 --> 01:00:42.293
I don't ever want you
to be like me and your dad.

01:00:42.295 --> 01:00:43.530
Don't you ever be like us.

01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:47.566
You're a special kid, Micah.

01:00:47.568 --> 01:00:50.135
I can see why your dad
loves you so much.

01:00:50.137 --> 01:00:52.403
Hell, you deserve
better than this.

01:00:52.405 --> 01:00:54.472
This life
ain't for the normal people.

01:00:54.474 --> 01:00:56.106
Can I finish this one, still?

01:00:56.108 --> 01:00:58.112
Please? Please?

01:00:58.579 --> 01:00:59.612
[scoffs]

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:03.280
Yeah, but I'm gonna need you
to do me a favor.

01:01:03.282 --> 01:01:04.516
You gotta promise me

01:01:04.518 --> 01:01:06.952
that you will keep
these headphones on,

01:01:06.954 --> 01:01:08.489
and listen to your music.

01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:10.387
Okay?

01:01:10.389 --> 01:01:13.291
And no matter what,
don't you come out this room.

01:01:13.293 --> 01:01:15.427
[Miles] Now your mom and dad
will be here shortly,

01:01:15.429 --> 01:01:17.896
and they'll see
your beautiful artwork.

01:01:17.898 --> 01:01:20.030
But in the meantime,
you just enjoy that music, okay?

01:01:20.032 --> 01:01:21.166
Okay.

01:01:21.168 --> 01:01:23.133
I'll come check on you
from time to time, you got me?

01:01:23.135 --> 01:01:24.471
- Yep.
- All right.

01:01:25.472 --> 01:01:27.475
[rock music playing]

01:01:43.657 --> 01:01:45.860
[car engine revving]

01:02:02.041 --> 01:02:04.511
[alarm beeping]

01:02:07.614 --> 01:02:10.217
[gun clicking]

01:02:16.255 --> 01:02:18.525
[rock music playing]

01:02:25.331 --> 01:02:27.969
[gun clicking]

01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:43.248
[Sergey] Are you pumped?

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.450
This is not a relaxation party.
Huh?

01:02:45.452 --> 01:02:46.517
Be ready.

01:02:46.519 --> 01:02:48.385
He's coming any minute now.

01:02:48.387 --> 01:02:49.720
This guy is dangerous!

01:02:49.722 --> 01:02:50.925
Sergey!

01:02:51.692 --> 01:02:53.191
[Sergey] Are we pumped or what?

01:02:53.193 --> 01:02:55.193
Chase won't even make it inside.

01:02:55.195 --> 01:02:56.260
They are lit.

01:02:56.262 --> 01:02:57.695
I want everybody to leave.

01:02:57.697 --> 01:02:58.731
What?

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.465
[Miles] Leave the weapons
and the ammunition.

01:03:00.467 --> 01:03:02.133
Have them exit my house.

01:03:02.135 --> 01:03:03.101
I don't understand, Miles.

01:03:03.103 --> 01:03:05.170
- I thought that you wanted...
- [Miles] Hey!

01:03:05.172 --> 01:03:06.173
Get it done.

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.641
Okay, Miles.

01:03:09.643 --> 01:03:11.208
All right, guys,
let's pack it up.

01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:12.144
[Sergey] Pack it up.

01:03:12.146 --> 01:03:13.345
- <i>Davai! Davai!</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:03:13.347 --> 01:03:14.445
What's going on?

01:03:14.447 --> 01:03:15.546
- What do you mean pack it up?
- Just leave, Caleb.

01:03:15.548 --> 01:03:16.615
[Sergey] It's not happening.

01:03:16.617 --> 01:03:18.083
- I drove a hundred miles, Miles.
- [Miles laughing]

01:03:18.085 --> 01:03:19.017
[Sergey] Stop it, Caleb.

01:03:19.019 --> 01:03:20.552
I drove a hundred
fucking miles, Miles!

01:03:20.554 --> 01:03:22.123
- [thuds]
- [groans]

01:03:24.056 --> 01:03:25.091
[thwacks]

01:03:25.692 --> 01:03:27.525
[thudding]

01:03:27.527 --> 01:03:29.195

- [Caleb grunting]

01:03:29.762 --> 01:03:31.431
[thudding]

01:03:35.335 --> 01:03:37.003
[Miles laughing]

01:03:40.007 --> 01:03:42.240
- [Sergey grunts]
- [Caleb groans]

01:03:42.242 --> 01:03:43.711
- [thuds]
- [groans]

01:03:54.186 --> 01:03:55.387
All right, that's enough
of this gay shit.

01:03:55.389 --> 01:03:56.621
Hey! Jayla, Nathan!

01:03:56.623 --> 01:03:58.222
Come break this shit up, man.

01:03:58.224 --> 01:03:59.791
Hey! Get the fuck off!

01:03:59.793 --> 01:04:01.425
[Nathan] You heard Miles!
Get the fuck up!

01:04:01.427 --> 01:04:02.394
[Miles] All right, that's it.

01:04:02.396 --> 01:04:03.394
Party time is over,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:04:03.396 --> 01:04:06.197
Sergey, come get
your almost lost ass over here.

01:04:06.199 --> 01:04:08.233
Everybody else,
get the fuck outta my house.

01:04:08.235 --> 01:04:09.704
Get the fuck out! Move!

01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:19.711
[Sergey exhales deeply]

01:04:19.713 --> 01:04:21.449
You know, that big nigga
almost beat you.

01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:24.148
I had him.

01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:25.152
Shit.

01:04:27.753 --> 01:04:29.757
[foreboding music]

01:04:40.199 --> 01:04:41.735
[inhales deeply]

01:04:55.648 --> 01:04:57.183
[cocks gun]

01:04:59.753 --> 01:05:01.222
Oh, fuck!

01:05:11.130 --> 01:05:13.266
[foreboding music]

01:05:32.219 --> 01:05:33.751
[door opens]

01:05:33.753 --> 01:05:35.256
[doorbell chimes]

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:39.157
[Miles] Ha!

01:05:39.159 --> 01:05:41.327
Chase!

01:05:41.827 --> 01:05:44.295
What's up, baby?

01:05:44.297 --> 01:05:46.396
[Miles laughs]

01:05:46.398 --> 01:05:47.465
[Miles] My man.

01:05:47.467 --> 01:05:49.467
Hey, I missed you, boy.

01:05:49.469 --> 01:05:52.072
Look, you remember Sergey,
right?

01:05:52.539 --> 01:05:53.804
Of course.

01:05:53.806 --> 01:05:55.606
How's the knee?

01:05:55.608 --> 01:05:58.775
Put a little oil and elbow
grease in it once a week,

01:05:58.777 --> 01:06:00.478
- and we're in business.
- [Miles snickers]

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.817
Hey, Chase,
you don't mind if he, uh...

01:06:04.317 --> 01:06:06.353
I mean, you know,
it's kind of a precaution.

01:06:08.155 --> 01:06:09.390
Knock yourself out.

01:06:16.463 --> 01:06:17.698
[groans]

01:06:19.599 --> 01:06:21.231
[Sergey] We're good.

01:06:21.233 --> 01:06:23.200
You trained him well, huh?

01:06:23.202 --> 01:06:24.802
How's the rolling over
and barking coming along?

01:06:24.804 --> 01:06:26.737
Oh, come on, Chase,
that's not fair.

01:06:26.739 --> 01:06:29.173
You're hitting below
the belt, baby.

01:06:29.175 --> 01:06:30.878
Sergey here,
is what you call a...

01:06:32.378 --> 01:06:34.545
- stand-up guy.
- Mmm.

01:06:34.547 --> 01:06:35.880
Sergey, do me a favor.

01:06:35.882 --> 01:06:37.518
Give me and my man
a couple of beats.

01:06:38.284 --> 01:06:39.286
We gotta rap.

01:06:40.753 --> 01:06:41.755
Yeah?

01:06:45.492 --> 01:06:46.791
Woo! Woo!

01:06:46.793 --> 01:06:50.427
Hey, don't mind him.
He's fucking harmless.

01:06:50.429 --> 01:06:52.796
I bet you when you walked
your ass through that door,

01:06:52.798 --> 01:06:55.201
you thought you had a shitload
of SWAT waiting on you, huh?

01:06:56.202 --> 01:06:57.901
[Chase] Not really.

01:06:57.903 --> 01:07:01.208
I kept my end of the bargain,
and stayed put.

01:07:01.807 --> 01:07:03.441
Didn't you?

01:07:03.443 --> 01:07:05.409
[Miles] Well, uh, bet you put up
a pretty good fight

01:07:05.411 --> 01:07:06.646
better than Burke though, right?

01:07:08.782 --> 01:07:10.548
You know, I didn't want it
to end this way.

01:07:10.550 --> 01:07:12.450
Ah, come on. Shit.

01:07:12.452 --> 01:07:13.851
Sure you did, Chase.

01:07:13.853 --> 01:07:15.519
It's your killer instinct.

01:07:15.521 --> 01:07:17.688
Well, you can deny it
all you want,

01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:19.359
- we both know it's in there.
- [snickers]

01:07:20.393 --> 01:07:21.693
What's so funny?

01:07:21.695 --> 01:07:23.330
It wasn't me who did Lola in.

01:07:25.599 --> 01:07:26.863
- Blair?
- Mm.

01:07:26.865 --> 01:07:28.499
She kinda saved my life.

01:07:28.501 --> 01:07:29.733
Huh.

01:07:29.735 --> 01:07:31.735
So, you had the bitch trained
better than I thought, huh?

01:07:31.737 --> 01:07:33.704
Oh, more than you know.

01:07:33.706 --> 01:07:35.873
Let me ask you
a question, Chase.

01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:37.407
Did you give
any serious consideration

01:07:37.409 --> 01:07:38.645
of what we talked about
yesterday?

01:07:39.612 --> 01:07:40.811
I did.

01:07:40.813 --> 01:07:43.615
Come on, man, you got me waiting
with bated breath, nigga!

01:07:43.617 --> 01:07:45.319
What's your fucking answer?

01:07:49.556 --> 01:07:51.659
I'm taking Micah,
and I'm leaving.

01:07:52.659 --> 01:07:56.394
No words, no fights, it's over.

01:07:56.396 --> 01:07:57.831
[Chase] I'm choosing my side,
Miles.

01:07:59.365 --> 01:08:00.967
I really didn't want it
to end this way.

01:08:02.802 --> 01:08:04.568
[chuckles, clicks tongue]

01:08:04.570 --> 01:08:06.037
You know,
there was a moment when I...

01:08:06.039 --> 01:08:08.375
despite everything,
I was actually gonna choose you.

01:08:09.742 --> 01:08:10.978
[Chase] But Lola
coming over, and...

01:08:11.811 --> 01:08:13.911
violating Blair again?

01:08:13.913 --> 01:08:16.250
Nah, you just did me wrong.

01:08:17.884 --> 01:08:18.953
Enough is enough.

01:08:22.654 --> 01:08:24.455
So, are you out then?

01:08:24.457 --> 01:08:27.524
[laughs]
Okay. You're out.

01:08:27.527 --> 01:08:28.828
[Miles] You're fucking out.

01:08:29.662 --> 01:08:30.763
Just like that, huh?

01:08:31.596 --> 01:08:33.330
Just like that.

01:08:33.332 --> 01:08:35.399
Well, fuck it.

01:08:35.402 --> 01:08:37.002
Guess you're gonna take them
both home then, right?

01:08:38.002 --> 01:08:39.006
Both?

01:08:40.673 --> 01:08:42.372
Sergey!

01:08:42.375 --> 01:08:43.607
Bring 'em on out!

01:08:43.609 --> 01:08:45.009
[Blair] Get off me! Chase!

01:08:45.011 --> 01:08:47.611
- [Chase] You motherfucker!
- [Miles] Man, fuck that!

01:08:47.613 --> 01:08:49.479
That's two times, motherfucker!

01:08:49.481 --> 01:08:51.415
[Miles] That's twice
you let your bitch be handled.

01:08:51.417 --> 01:08:52.849
You fucking piece of shit!

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:54.618
Nah, nah,
if she was all that to you,

01:08:54.621 --> 01:08:57.054
you wouldn't let it happen.
Again.

01:08:57.055 --> 01:08:58.122
We know the deal, Chase.

01:08:58.125 --> 01:09:00.657
Deep down inside,
you're a selfish motherfucker.

01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:03.493
Nigga, you're just like me!
You can't see that shit?

01:09:03.496 --> 01:09:05.729
Let's fucking drop this, okay?
Drop all of this. Okay?

01:09:05.731 --> 01:09:07.564
Nah, this thing ain't be
on me, playboy,

01:09:07.567 --> 01:09:09.533
this one's on you.

01:09:09.536 --> 01:09:10.968
But I'll tell you what, though,

01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:14.471
since I'm a good dude,
I actually like your boy.

01:09:14.474 --> 01:09:16.107
I'm gonna let him
and mom deuce bounce.

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:17.375
[Miles] But you ain't
never gonna see

01:09:17.377 --> 01:09:18.509
the motherfuckers again.

01:09:18.511 --> 01:09:19.910
Well, what am I supposed
to fucking do?

01:09:19.912 --> 01:09:20.977
Well, go get your ass back
on that block,

01:09:20.979 --> 01:09:22.045
like one of my hoes,

01:09:22.046 --> 01:09:24.115
and get paid
for what you're good at.

01:09:24.117 --> 01:09:26.416
- Killing people.
- [Sergey exhales deeply]

01:09:26.417 --> 01:09:28.051
[Miles] Oh, wait a minute.

01:09:28.054 --> 01:09:29.786
We know you don't just kill
the bad guys, do you?

01:09:29.787 --> 01:09:31.089
[Chase] Don't you fucking dare.

01:09:31.091 --> 01:09:32.456
Yeah, why don't you
let everybody know

01:09:32.457 --> 01:09:33.527
who else you've killed.

01:09:35.627 --> 01:09:36.626
What the hell
is he talking about?

01:09:36.627 --> 01:09:38.395
He doesn't know
what he's fucking talking about!

01:09:38.398 --> 01:09:39.629
He's a fucking moron!

01:09:39.631 --> 01:09:41.598
Why don't you let Ms. Blair know

01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.134
what happened to her daddy?

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:44.505
[Sergey snickers]

01:09:45.837 --> 01:09:49.506
He's a fucking liar,
like you always said!

01:09:49.509 --> 01:09:50.774
[Miles] You know what,
Chase has never been

01:09:50.777 --> 01:09:52.542
a particularly good storyteller.

01:09:52.545 --> 01:09:54.144
So I think I'll take over.

01:09:54.145 --> 01:09:56.380
Hell, I'll even throw in
some of Micah stories.

01:09:56.382 --> 01:09:57.850
[whimpers]

01:09:59.152 --> 01:10:00.721
[exhales heavily]

01:10:02.889 --> 01:10:04.625
[clatters]

01:10:21.073 --> 01:10:23.076
[suspenseful music]

01:10:44.029 --> 01:10:45.662
Now, is this the part
where you tell us

01:10:45.664 --> 01:10:48.598
who killed Micah's real parents?

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:50.371
[Miles] Didn't you have
something to do with that?

01:10:50.869 --> 01:10:51.939
Huh, Chase?

01:10:52.872 --> 01:10:54.805
[sing-song]
Oh, Chase?

01:10:54.807 --> 01:10:55.809
Hmm?

01:10:59.746 --> 01:11:00.911
[Chase] I did.

01:11:00.913 --> 01:11:02.112
[Miles] Ah!

01:11:02.114 --> 01:11:03.449
- Blair.
- [Blair groans]

01:11:04.751 --> 01:11:05.982
[Miles] See, doesn't that
feel better?

01:11:05.984 --> 01:11:08.452
To get that burden
off your chest?

01:11:08.454 --> 01:11:11.188
Yeah, but there's
no going back now, is there?

01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:13.558
I mean even if she
was fucking stupid enough

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.991
to take you back.

01:11:14.993 --> 01:11:16.794
[Miles] Can you imagine
how that would look?

01:11:16.796 --> 01:11:18.728
Her having to look
in the eyes of the man

01:11:18.730 --> 01:11:21.031
that killed her daddy.

01:11:21.033 --> 01:11:24.067
And Micah's real parents.

01:11:24.069 --> 01:11:25.805
- [Chase grunts]
- [glass shatters]

01:11:26.538 --> 01:11:27.875
[both grunt]

01:11:28.608 --> 01:11:30.476
[Sergey groans]

01:11:32.479 --> 01:11:34.111
- [gunshots]
- [Blair yelling]

01:11:34.113 --> 01:11:36.013
[body thuds]

01:11:36.015 --> 01:11:37.418
- [Chase yells]
- [both grunting]

01:11:40.019 --> 01:11:41.622
[muffled screaming]

01:11:50.997 --> 01:11:53.000
[grunting]

01:11:59.805 --> 01:12:01.774
[grunting continues]

01:12:05.511 --> 01:12:07.146
[Miles groaning]

01:12:09.148 --> 01:12:10.751
[Chase] Bring it down!

01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:13.019
[Miles groaning]

01:12:16.256 --> 01:12:17.925
[grunts]

01:12:19.192 --> 01:12:20.661

01:12:21.226 --> 01:12:22.496
[Blair cocks gun]

01:12:23.563 --> 01:12:25.028
[Chase] Wait a minute, Blair.

01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:26.897
Don't, don't even talk.

01:12:26.899 --> 01:12:28.501
[Blair] I don't even
wanna hear you right now.

01:12:33.072 --> 01:12:34.208
Who are you?

01:12:36.009 --> 01:12:37.243
Who are you anymore?

01:12:38.243 --> 01:12:40.579
[panting]

01:12:44.650 --> 01:12:46.886
Maybe you should just
get it over and done with, huh?

01:12:48.087 --> 01:12:50.791
Get Micah, and...
let me bleed out.

01:12:52.958 --> 01:12:54.728
[Chase] It's not gonna change
the past, but...

01:12:56.296 --> 01:12:58.228
it's definitely gonna...

01:12:58.230 --> 01:13:00.865
stop things from happening
in the future.

01:13:00.867 --> 01:13:03.233
[rapid approaching footsteps]

01:13:03.235 --> 01:13:04.869
[Micah] Mommy!

01:13:04.871 --> 01:13:06.571
Baby, don't look.
Don't look, okay?

01:13:06.573 --> 01:13:08.171
Just focus on me,
focus on me, okay?

01:13:08.173 --> 01:13:09.906
Look what I got for you
and Daddy.

01:13:09.908 --> 01:13:11.342
Yeah, I love these.

01:13:11.344 --> 01:13:13.044
They're so great.
Are you ready to go home?

01:13:13.046 --> 01:13:14.111
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go home.

01:13:14.113 --> 01:13:15.245
Just don't look, okay?

01:13:15.247 --> 01:13:16.847
Okay, just go to the door,
come on.

01:13:16.849 --> 01:13:18.348
- [Blair] Okay, good boy.
- [Micah] Mm.

01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:19.619
[Blair] Oh, god.

01:13:20.752 --> 01:13:23.556
Oh. Daddy got a boo-boo.

01:13:24.222 --> 01:13:25.225
[Chase] Hey, champ.

01:13:26.658 --> 01:13:27.960
Daddy is just resting.

01:13:29.796 --> 01:13:31.265
Mommy is gonna take you
home now.

01:13:32.332 --> 01:13:34.764
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:13:34.766 --> 01:13:36.603
[sighs deeply]
No.

01:13:37.804 --> 01:13:39.370
Mommy is gonna take Daddy
to the hospital

01:13:39.372 --> 01:13:40.641
and make sure he's okay.

01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:43.708
[Blair] Is that okay, Micah?

01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:45.846
[Micah] Yeah,
I want Daddy to get better.

01:13:49.247 --> 01:13:50.781
Yeah, he needs to get better.

01:13:50.783 --> 01:13:52.750
[sighs sharply]

01:13:52.752 --> 01:13:54.755
["Eske Lakay Vin Bon"
by Stevenson Ducinvil playing]

01:15:19.439 --> 01:15:21.304
[Chase] <i>It's a funny thing,</i>

01:15:21.306 --> 01:15:22.406
<i>how memories and dreams</i>

01:15:22.408 --> 01:15:24.711
<i>can capture a person
in a better light.</i>

01:15:26.179 --> 01:15:27.314
<i>Slight changes.</i>

01:15:28.381 --> 01:15:31.014
<i>Micah, looking calm.</i>

01:15:31.016 --> 01:15:33.353
<i>Blair, looking a bit better
and at ease.</i>

01:15:35.822 --> 01:15:37.420
<i>The intricacies of people.</i>

01:15:37.422 --> 01:15:39.693
<i>I love to give me
a better peace of mind.</i>

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.326
<i>Even thinking about Miles now.</i>

01:15:43.328 --> 01:15:46.097
<i>Of course, I think about
all of his jokes.</i>

01:15:46.099 --> 01:15:49.799
<i>His humor, his friendship.</i>

01:15:49.801 --> 01:15:51.802
<i>Miles was right
about a lot of things,</i>

01:15:51.804 --> 01:15:53.073
<i>as cynical as they were.</i>

01:15:54.439 --> 01:15:56.108
<i>Nobody could escape the life.</i>

01:15:56.908 --> 01:15:58.110
<i>Nobody.</i>

01:15:59.045 --> 01:16:01.778
<i>It was more than an a addiction.</i>

01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:03.981
<i>It was an uncontrollable desire
to continue</i>

01:16:03.983 --> 01:16:07.151
<i>and put anybody's life at risk,
including your own.</i>

01:16:07.153 --> 01:16:10.787
<i>It was never gonna end pretty
for either one of us.</i>

01:16:10.789 --> 01:16:12.123
<i>I think I chose my fate
the minute</i>

01:16:12.125 --> 01:16:14.327
<i>Miles had me enter
this world at 15.</i>

01:16:16.529 --> 01:16:19.295
<i>The moment
I really started living,</i>

01:16:19.297 --> 01:16:21.268
<i>was also the moment
I started dying.</i>

01:16:24.069 --> 01:16:26.771
<i>I always remembered the quote,</i>

01:16:26.773 --> 01:16:29.305
<i>"Death is not
the opposite of life,</i>

01:16:29.307 --> 01:16:30.409

01:16:31.444 --> 01:16:33.043

01:16:36.414 --> 01:16:38.415

<i>for so many people.</i>

01:16:40.853 --> 01:16:42.419
<i>Like I said,</i>

01:16:42.421 --> 01:16:45.054

01:16:46.993 --> 01:16:48.729

01:16:53.966 --> 01:16:56.136

<i>I don't know why...</i>

01:17:03.509 --> 01:17:04.978

<i>all I could picture</i>

01:17:07.012 --> 01:17:09.282

to fall asleep.</i>
