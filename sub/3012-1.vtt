00:44.120 --> 00:46.414
Take her wrap, fellas

00:46.456 --> 00:49.083
Find her an empty lap,
fellas

00:49.167 --> 00:54.089
Dolly'll never go away

00:54.172 --> 00:58.718
Dolly'll never go away
again

01:02.763 --> 01:04.182
Hey, do you guys
know this one?

01:05.934 --> 01:07.518
Oh!

01:07.602 --> 01:09.437
Now this is the real shit.

01:09.479 --> 01:10.979
Uh-huh.

01:14.234 --> 01:16.693
Shake your ass,
watch yourself

01:16.777 --> 01:18.238
Shake your ass

01:18.278 --> 01:19.738
Show me what
you're working with

01:19.780 --> 01:21.782
Attention all
young players and pimps

01:21.866 --> 01:24.034
Right now
is the place to be

01:24.118 --> 01:26.911
I thought I told
y'all niggers before

01:26.953 --> 01:28.956
Y'all niggers
don't fuck with me

01:29.040 --> 01:30.581
Shake your ass

01:30.665 --> 01:31.750
Watch yourself

01:31.833 --> 01:33.169
Shake your ass

01:33.211 --> 01:34.378
Show me what
you're working with

01:34.420 --> 01:35.628
Shake your ass

01:38.923 --> 01:40.925
You suck.

01:44.430 --> 01:46.347
- Uh!
- Uh!

01:53.187 --> 01:54.147
Oh!

01:54.188 --> 01:57.191
Who put the horse out?

02:06.074 --> 02:07.410
She's good.

02:11.247 --> 02:14.249
She--she's been really sick.

02:16.460 --> 02:18.755
Bad, bad, bad girl!

02:25.468 --> 02:28.430
OK. That'll be $17.50.

02:28.472 --> 02:30.599
Hey, buddy!
Hey, pay the fare.

02:35.562 --> 02:36.855
I'm Father McFeely.

02:36.897 --> 02:38.273
I'm so glad you're here.

02:38.315 --> 02:40.400
I came as fast as I could,
but at my age...

02:40.483 --> 02:42.486
the little soldier needs
a lot more thumping...

02:42.570 --> 02:44.529
before it starts pumping,
if you know what I mean.

02:44.570 --> 02:46.281
I do find, though,
if I tickle my asshole...

02:46.322 --> 02:48.699
just before I unleash
the dog of war--

02:48.741 --> 02:50.034
It's OK. I understand.

02:50.076 --> 02:52.036
You know,
because in the old days...

02:52.078 --> 02:53.579
you know when you--

02:55.623 --> 02:57.084
How is she?

02:58.293 --> 02:59.460
It's gotten worse, Father.

02:59.501 --> 03:01.963
Really?

03:02.005 --> 03:04.966
She won't eat,
she won't talk.

03:06.175 --> 03:08.974
The child won't even
let me touch her.

03:09.011 --> 03:12.640
Yes. Sometimes you have
to give them candy.

03:12.682 --> 03:13.890
Father...

03:13.974 --> 03:16.435
the church sent me
to assist you.

03:16.519 --> 03:18.520
I'm Father Harris.

03:18.603 --> 03:20.564
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to see you.

03:20.606 --> 03:23.025
Would you like
to see the girl?

03:23.066 --> 03:25.361
Soon...

03:25.402 --> 03:27.905
but first
I must bless this house.

03:45.379 --> 03:47.965
"The sorrows of death
compassed me...

03:48.049 --> 03:50.342
"and the pains of Hell
got hold upon me.

03:50.384 --> 03:51.553
"I found... "

03:53.846 --> 03:56.682
"Then called I upon
the name of the Lord and... "

04:11.280 --> 04:13.323
"My soul from death. "

04:13.406 --> 04:15.867
Oh, God. Please, Lord.

04:15.951 --> 04:19.370
Help me to release
this demon.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.791
Ahh!

04:23.833 --> 04:27.629
Thank you, Lord,
the most merciful Almighty.

04:27.670 --> 04:28.921
Oh, hold on.

04:32.466 --> 04:34.928
Ahh!
Ah, those enchiladas.

04:35.012 --> 04:36.888
Ha, ha, ha!

04:38.764 --> 04:39.807
Thank you, Lord.

04:58.075 --> 04:59.493
Aah!

04:59.535 --> 05:01.120
Fuck this.

05:02.162 --> 05:03.580
Father!

05:03.663 --> 05:05.458
Fuck! Did you see this?
Look at this!

05:05.500 --> 05:07.167
Please, Father,
think of the child.

05:07.251 --> 05:08.211
Fuck!

05:08.251 --> 05:09.587
Yes.

05:16.926 --> 05:18.553
It's freezing.

05:37.071 --> 05:38.239
Let us pray.

05:38.280 --> 05:40.742
"Defender of the human race...

05:40.784 --> 05:43.578
"look down in pity upon this,
your servant. "

05:43.620 --> 05:45.996
Shove it up your ass,
you worthless piece of shit.

05:46.038 --> 05:47.665
Aah!

05:47.749 --> 05:49.458
Silence!

05:49.542 --> 05:50.502
Mmm.

05:50.544 --> 05:51.877
"Holy Lord--"

05:51.919 --> 05:54.715
Your mother is in here
with us, Harris.

05:54.755 --> 05:55.715
Would you like
to leave a message?

05:55.797 --> 05:57.465
I'll be sure that she gets it.

05:57.549 --> 06:00.386
Yes. Mom, will you
get out of there, please?

06:02.263 --> 06:03.597
You're no fun.

06:03.639 --> 06:05.098
I'm working.

06:05.140 --> 06:07.226
See you later,
Mrs. Harris.

06:07.309 --> 06:09.812
"Holy Lord,
Almighty Father in--"

06:09.896 --> 06:10.854
Aah!

06:10.896 --> 06:11.855
"Everlasting God...

06:11.897 --> 06:14.024
"and Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ...

06:14.108 --> 06:16.400
"and the Virgin Mary's
baby daddy.

06:16.442 --> 06:19.446
"Holy Lord,
Almighty Father...

06:19.530 --> 06:21.072
"everlasting God...

06:21.114 --> 06:24.033
"who once consigned
that fallen tyrant...

06:24.075 --> 06:25.452
"to the flames of Hell...

06:25.493 --> 06:28.580
"who sent your only son
into the world...

06:28.664 --> 06:30.748
"to crush
that roaring tiger...

06:30.790 --> 06:32.667
"and who got
that unholy bitch Jerri...

06:32.751 --> 06:33.918
"kicked off of "Survivor--"

06:34.002 --> 06:36.755
Fuck me! Fuck me!

06:36.797 --> 06:40.216
Father!

06:40.299 --> 06:41.258
Huh?

06:41.300 --> 06:43.260
This is not
part of the ritual.

06:44.471 --> 06:49.434
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy--

06:49.476 --> 06:51.476
Ha, ha, ha!

06:59.943 --> 07:00.944
Ha, ha, ha!

07:02.613 --> 07:04.156
Ha, ha, ha!

07:09.703 --> 07:11.205
Oh!

07:12.998 --> 07:14.456
Here you go, Father.
All clean.

07:14.540 --> 07:16.001
Oh, thank you so much.

07:16.042 --> 07:18.003
OK.

07:18.044 --> 07:20.046
Hee, hee, hee!

07:20.129 --> 07:22.089
You failed, McFeely.

07:22.173 --> 07:24.675
Your weapons are useless
against me.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.511
Let us pray.

07:26.553 --> 07:29.430
[Both] Our Father who Art in Heaven--

07:29.471 --> 07:30.640
Ha ha!

07:30.681 --> 07:32.146
Stop it!

07:32.183 --> 07:33.684
Hallowed be Thy name.

07:33.721 --> 07:34.811
Ha ha!

07:34.852 --> 07:35.937
Zip it.

07:36.062 --> 07:37.188
Thy kingdom come.

07:37.272 --> 07:40.273
Your mother sucks cocks in Hell.

07:40.357 --> 07:41.316
Ha! Shit!

07:44.862 --> 07:46.447
Suck on this.

07:46.531 --> 07:47.698
Uh-oh!

07:55.498 --> 07:56.915
I let you go

07:56.999 --> 07:59.042
Let you go
like a dozen balloons

08:01.129 --> 08:03.546
Without even thinking

08:03.588 --> 08:05.674
I didn't know,
now I know

08:05.716 --> 08:10.971
It was much too soon

08:11.012 --> 08:16.226
Why can't you call
and say you miss me?

08:16.268 --> 08:18.311
So you think you made it
into the class, Shorty?

08:18.353 --> 08:19.687
I sure hope so, Cindy.

08:19.729 --> 08:21.627
You could use the grade, huh?

08:21.663 --> 08:23.524
Nah. I need a place to stay.

08:23.565 --> 08:26.277
Mom Dukes kicked me out,
but you know something?

08:26.319 --> 08:28.779
I learned something
very important in college--

08:28.821 --> 08:30.114
the value of books.

08:30.156 --> 08:31.157
Really?

08:31.198 --> 08:32.326
Yeah. Look at this here.

08:33.909 --> 08:38.455
Free paper. Ha ha!
Shit, son.

08:38.496 --> 08:40.750
Yeah, so how
you digging college?

08:40.791 --> 08:42.001
I don't know.

08:42.042 --> 08:44.503
It's OK, I guess.

08:44.545 --> 08:46.881
I feel like such a geek
sometimes, though.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.466
Everyone is so cool,
and I'm... not.

08:49.508 --> 08:51.595
Oh, come on, Cindy.

08:51.635 --> 08:53.053
You ain't that bad.

08:53.094 --> 08:55.055
All you need is
a little bit of flavor.

08:55.097 --> 08:56.640
Hmm. Maybe some new gear.

08:56.682 --> 08:57.891
"Gear?"

08:57.932 --> 08:59.226
That's slang for "clothing. "

08:59.267 --> 09:01.228
- Oh.
- Here. Come on.

09:01.269 --> 09:02.646
We gonna cool you up
right now.

09:02.687 --> 09:06.275
Don't sit like this,
first of all.

09:06.317 --> 09:08.359
Don't sit like that, son.
Sit cool.

09:08.401 --> 09:10.279
- OK.
- Right up, son.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.364
Feel yourself, son,
like that.

09:12.405 --> 09:13.698
Yeah. Now go like this.

09:13.739 --> 09:15.950
Uh. Uh, yeah.

09:15.992 --> 09:17.952
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

09:17.994 --> 09:19.621
Yeah. Now stand up,
let me show you some moves.

09:19.662 --> 09:21.999
Right, left.

09:22.041 --> 09:24.166
Uh, son. Uh!

09:24.208 --> 09:25.461
Right, left.

09:25.502 --> 09:26.670
Right, kick.

09:26.712 --> 09:27.712
Uh, son.

09:27.754 --> 09:28.963
Uh, psych.

09:29.004 --> 09:30.048
Throw a little bit
of slang in there.

09:30.090 --> 09:33.885
Say, "Yo, that jacket
is tight, son. Ya mean?"

09:33.926 --> 09:36.679
Yo, that jacket is tight, son.

09:36.721 --> 09:38.430
- Ya mean?
- Ya mean?

09:38.472 --> 09:41.476
Yeah, something like that.

09:41.518 --> 09:42.476
Throw it all together.

09:42.517 --> 09:44.102
OK. Right, left.

09:44.144 --> 09:45.813
Right, kick, uh!

09:45.855 --> 09:47.981
Yo, that jacket is tight.

09:48.022 --> 09:51.110
Now run that shit, bitch.
Ya mean?

09:53.153 --> 09:55.197
That is the shit, dog.

09:55.239 --> 09:58.283
Oh, man.
You boners aren't ready yet?

09:58.324 --> 10:00.411
Dude, relax, man.
I'm telling you,

10:00.453 --> 10:02.412
We'll get there on time,
all right?

10:02.453 --> 10:04.248
Yo, dogs, what y'all think?

10:04.289 --> 10:05.957
Tucked in or out?

10:07.542 --> 10:08.710
- Out, man.
- Out, man. Come on.

10:08.752 --> 10:11.213
No doubt. No doubt.
That's what I thought.

10:11.255 --> 10:13.923
You fuckheads would be ready if
you weren't partying all night.

10:13.965 --> 10:16.301
Come on, man.
It was so awesome.

10:16.342 --> 10:17.677
We got so wasted, man!

10:17.718 --> 10:19.388
I had, like, a keg myself.

10:19.429 --> 10:21.514
I woke up naked
in a tub of ice.

10:21.555 --> 10:22.598
All right!

10:22.639 --> 10:24.064
Yeah, man.

10:24.100 --> 10:27.353
Oh, shit, Ray,
you got a tattoo.

10:27.395 --> 10:29.647
Oh, shit.
What's it say?

10:29.689 --> 10:31.857
"Ray!" Oh, man.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.776
Oh, shit,
you got a tattoo, too.

10:33.812 --> 10:34.861
Oh, really? Dude!

10:34.903 --> 10:36.737
Dude, what's it say?

10:36.779 --> 10:38.280
"Fucked me. "

10:38.322 --> 10:40.241
Oh, sweet, man.
"Ray... "

10:40.283 --> 10:41.491
"Fucked me. "

10:41.533 --> 10:43.619
- "Ray... "
- "Fucked me. "

10:43.661 --> 10:45.495
"Ray fucked me. "

10:45.537 --> 10:48.416
Yeah! Ha ha! Whoo!

10:48.456 --> 10:50.459
What, man?

10:50.501 --> 10:51.751
Oh.

10:51.793 --> 10:53.419
Wedgie moment! Ha ha!

10:53.461 --> 10:56.881
Come on. You're gonna give me
a yeast infection.

10:56.965 --> 10:58.550
Hey, girl, that jacket
is slamming.

10:58.592 --> 10:59.551
Thanks.

10:59.593 --> 11:00.718
You better be careful,
though.

11:00.759 --> 11:02.012
Some girl
got an ass-whipping...

11:02.053 --> 11:03.763
over a jacket
stolen earlier today.

11:03.805 --> 11:06.099
Some people is so ghetto.

11:06.141 --> 11:08.268
What class we got next?

11:08.310 --> 11:09.394
Psychology.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.604
Oh! Me, too! 101?

11:11.646 --> 11:14.524
- In room 302 at 10 o' clock?
- That's it!

11:14.566 --> 11:17.068
Oh! Uh-uh!
No. This is too much.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.361
I got these psychic powers
on line.

11:18.403 --> 11:20.906
Remind me to get
a lotto ticket tomorrow.

11:20.988 --> 11:22.907
Oh, don't split the pole now.

11:22.948 --> 11:25.701
That is very, very bad luck.
My psychic told me.

11:25.743 --> 11:28.120
You don't really believe
in that stuff, do you?

11:28.162 --> 11:30.123
Yes, I do. Very much.

11:36.253 --> 11:37.921
Are these all the subjects?

11:37.963 --> 11:40.048
Yes, sir.
I took the liberty of putting...

11:40.091 --> 11:42.468
those with near-death
experiences on the very top.

11:42.504 --> 11:43.934
Any of them hot?

11:43.970 --> 11:47.180
As I'm sure you are aware,
Professor...

11:47.222 --> 11:50.392
subjects who are close to death
are statistically more likely...

11:50.433 --> 11:52.145
to have
the suggestibility required...

11:52.185 --> 11:55.187
for paranormal investigation,
which is why, of course...

11:55.229 --> 11:58.108
I gave them
special consideration.

11:58.149 --> 11:59.735
Oh, good thinking, Dwight.

11:59.775 --> 12:02.153
Traumatized coeds
are a sure thing.

12:05.156 --> 12:06.532
Ooh, I like her.

12:06.574 --> 12:08.889
Oh, yes, sir.
That is Cindy Campbell--

12:08.926 --> 12:11.204
classic abandoned
personality disorder.

12:11.246 --> 12:13.122
She seems guarded,
but willing.

12:14.165 --> 12:15.791
And this?

12:15.833 --> 12:17.460
That is Ray Wilkins, sir.

12:17.501 --> 12:19.045
I couldn't quite
figure him out...

12:19.087 --> 12:21.380
but he seemed very eager
and pleased to meet me.

12:21.421 --> 12:23.634
What's this?

12:23.674 --> 12:28.387
It's a picture that he sent
after the interview.

12:28.429 --> 12:31.306
Where did you find these kids?

12:31.348 --> 12:32.850
Sir, they're all survivors...

12:32.892 --> 12:34.476
of the Stevenston County
Massacre.

12:34.518 --> 12:37.939
Oh, fantastic!

12:39.022 --> 12:42.609
These kids are exactly
the catalyst we need...

12:42.651 --> 12:46.321
to awaken
the spirits of Hell House.

12:46.363 --> 12:49.783
Sir, exactly how are we going
to get them up there?

12:49.867 --> 12:51.451
We'll tell them...

12:51.493 --> 12:53.078
it's part of the class.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.289
We'll say--excuse me--

12:56.331 --> 12:57.624
that they're participating
in a study...

12:57.666 --> 13:00.042
of sleep disorders.

13:00.084 --> 13:01.920
We are going
to make history, Dwight--

13:01.962 --> 13:04.338
the first documented...

13:04.380 --> 13:09.094
unrefuted evidence
of life after death.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.345
Welcome, everybody.

13:10.386 --> 13:12.514
I'm Professor Oldman.

13:12.556 --> 13:15.349
Each of you have been
carefully selected...

13:15.385 --> 13:16.768
to be in this class...

13:16.809 --> 13:20.605
for which you receive
an automatic grade of "A"...

13:20.647 --> 13:22.487
upon completion.

13:22.523 --> 13:25.985
Now, this year's study
is insomnia.

13:27.361 --> 13:29.738
We are going to spend
the weekend together...

13:29.780 --> 13:32.325
where we've established
a controlled environment...

13:32.367 --> 13:37.330
in which we'll study
your various sleep disorders.

13:37.371 --> 13:38.662
Now, I'll be passing out
directions--

13:38.704 --> 13:41.000
- I can do it.
- No.

13:41.041 --> 13:42.667
- No, Dwight.
- I can do it.

13:42.709 --> 13:45.963
I can... myself... do it.

13:46.004 --> 13:47.965
Now,
you should all be there...

13:48.005 --> 13:52.636
by 6 p. m. tonight
and plan to stay through Monday.

13:52.678 --> 13:54.345
I'll see you all this evening.

13:54.387 --> 13:56.681
Hey!

13:56.723 --> 13:58.057
You left your book
back there.

13:58.093 --> 14:00.685
Oh. Thanks.

14:00.727 --> 14:02.145
I'm Cindy.

14:02.187 --> 14:03.813
- Buddy.
- Hey.

14:03.855 --> 14:06.859
So, looks like we're gonna
spend the weekend together.

14:06.900 --> 14:08.192
Yeah.

14:08.233 --> 14:11.488
You want to get together
and study or something?

14:11.530 --> 14:13.739
Study? Ha!

14:14.741 --> 14:15.825
That was kind of bad.

14:15.866 --> 14:17.118
Ha, ha, ha!

14:17.160 --> 14:18.327
I'm sorry, Buddy.

14:18.369 --> 14:21.246
You seem like
a really nice guy...

14:21.288 --> 14:24.541
but I just got out of
a really bad relationship...

14:24.583 --> 14:26.836
so I'm not quite ready
to start dating yet.

14:26.877 --> 14:28.712
Oh.

14:28.754 --> 14:31.049
But, hey, you know,
maybe we could be friends.

14:31.090 --> 14:34.259
Sure. Yeah. Cool.
That--friends.

14:34.301 --> 14:36.429
OK. See you later, friend.

14:36.469 --> 14:38.347
All right, pal.

14:39.764 --> 14:41.059
Oh!

14:41.100 --> 14:44.561
Wedgie! Smell you later!

14:44.937 --> 14:48.941
As we go on, we remember

14:50.359 --> 14:52.777
All the good times

14:52.819 --> 14:55.780
We had together

14:55.822 --> 14:59.408
As our lives change

14:59.450 --> 15:01.744
Come whatever

15:01.786 --> 15:05.123
We will still be

15:05.165 --> 15:06.748
Friends forever

15:08.251 --> 15:10.503
Hey!
Will you shut the fuck up...

15:10.545 --> 15:11.880
and let me sing?

15:13.922 --> 15:19.888
La, la, la, la, la, la, la

15:19.929 --> 15:22.681
La, la, la, la, la, la, la...

15:52.460 --> 15:55.172
Ow!

15:55.213 --> 15:56.672
Hello?

15:59.175 --> 16:00.759
Oh!

16:02.845 --> 16:04.847
Hello?

16:15.107 --> 16:16.483
Hello?

16:18.694 --> 16:21.447
Hi, little guy.
Look at you.

16:21.489 --> 16:22.656
Little? I'm not little.

16:22.698 --> 16:25.659
I'm hung like a bull, lady.
Check it out.

16:25.695 --> 16:27.536
You ever seen
a bird dick this big?

16:27.578 --> 16:29.080
Too much for you, huh, baby?

16:29.122 --> 16:30.081
Yeah.

16:30.164 --> 16:32.081
All right.
Step off then, sweet cheeks.

16:32.123 --> 16:33.876
Come back when you want
some real loving.

16:35.210 --> 16:37.295
OK.

16:37.337 --> 16:38.755
Fucking tease.

16:45.804 --> 16:47.638
Hello?

16:50.849 --> 16:52.227
Aah!

16:58.441 --> 17:00.859
Oh, I'm--I'm sorry, child.

17:00.901 --> 17:02.616
Did I frighten you, child?

17:02.653 --> 17:06.615
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you scared?

17:06.656 --> 17:09.035
All right.
I'll sing to you.

17:09.077 --> 17:13.998
God is in his holy temple

17:19.046 --> 17:20.003
Better?

17:20.044 --> 17:23.549
I'm here with
Professor Oldman's group.

17:23.590 --> 17:26.886
I'm Hanson.
I'm the caretaker.

17:26.928 --> 17:28.554
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:28.596 --> 17:30.012
And what's your name,
sweet child?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.223
I'm Cindy.

17:31.265 --> 17:32.724
Cindy.

17:32.766 --> 17:36.436
Oh, but the resemblance
is striking.

17:36.478 --> 17:41.107
Look at the thin cheek bones
and the same lips.

17:41.149 --> 17:43.318
Same--same eyes.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.737
Look at your hair.

17:45.779 --> 17:46.738
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:46.780 --> 17:48.989
You've got the same nose.

17:49.031 --> 17:50.324
Tickle, tickle.

17:50.366 --> 17:52.660
Be-boop, be-boop
on the nose.

17:52.702 --> 17:54.244
Ha, ha, ha!

17:54.286 --> 17:56.789
Shall I show you to your room?

17:56.831 --> 17:59.625
Oh! Oh, that's heavy.
Whoo! That's heavy!

17:59.666 --> 18:01.919
I better use my strong hand.

18:01.961 --> 18:04.296
- Oh! Clumsy.
- Oh! No, that's fine.

18:04.337 --> 18:06.173
Look, you got the panties--

18:06.215 --> 18:07.633
I can take care of it.

18:07.675 --> 18:09.301
Look at--
Oh, what you got here?

18:10.552 --> 18:13.056
Ah!

18:13.098 --> 18:14.390
Can't forget your toothbrush.

18:14.431 --> 18:15.599
Oh!

18:15.640 --> 18:16.976
Gonna need that for later.

18:17.018 --> 18:18.769
OK. Here we go.
Follow me, child.

18:18.810 --> 18:20.479
- Oh, God.
- Watch my bottom.

18:20.521 --> 18:21.689
Coming through.

18:21.731 --> 18:23.606
Come on. Right this way.

18:23.648 --> 18:25.859
Here we are.

18:27.069 --> 18:30.864
So, um, do you
live here by yourself?

18:30.905 --> 18:32.700
Well, yes.
We've tried to rent it out...

18:32.741 --> 18:34.909
but people don't seem
to want to stay very long.

18:34.951 --> 18:38.579
Ha ha!
Oh, there's old Mother Kane...

18:38.621 --> 18:40.748
and that's old Master Kane.

18:40.790 --> 18:42.417
Who's that?

18:43.627 --> 18:45.545
That's Big Daddy Kane.

18:45.581 --> 18:46.670
Oh.

18:46.712 --> 18:47.840
Oh, he's cute.

18:47.881 --> 18:48.881
Oh, yeah.

18:48.923 --> 18:51.843
That was the master's
favorite toy.

18:51.885 --> 18:54.595
I don't know what
it's doing out here.

18:54.636 --> 18:56.139
I swear.
Sometimes I think...

18:56.181 --> 18:58.808
these toys have
a mind of their own.

19:00.643 --> 19:03.813
Ow! Ow!

19:09.151 --> 19:10.986
Right this way.

19:12.321 --> 19:15.240
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that room, sweetheart.

19:15.282 --> 19:17.533
No. That was the master's
mistress's room.

19:17.575 --> 19:21.538
Yeah, he kind of was
a little bit of a hornball.

19:21.579 --> 19:24.540
No. You go and stay
right over here.

19:24.582 --> 19:27.627
This was the room that belonged
to the love of his life...

19:27.669 --> 19:30.881
his wife, Caroline.

19:30.922 --> 19:32.298
I'll show it to you.

19:32.340 --> 19:34.884
Oh! Watch. My fanny's
coming through.

19:34.926 --> 19:38.095
Watch it.
Make room for fanny.

19:38.137 --> 19:41.392
Oh, wow! It's beautiful.

19:41.433 --> 19:42.642
Well, thank you, child.

19:42.684 --> 19:44.560
You know,
I have been working out.

19:44.602 --> 19:46.729
I've been doing
my bun busters every day.

19:46.771 --> 19:49.357
I squeeze really tight,
and then I let loose.

19:49.398 --> 19:52.026
I squeeze really tight...

19:52.066 --> 19:53.486
and then let loose.
[ Farting ]

19:53.528 --> 19:54.528
Ooh!

19:55.529 --> 19:59.533
OK. Ooh!

19:59.575 --> 20:01.452
Oh, yes.

20:01.494 --> 20:02.702
Look at this.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.872
Caroline looked beautiful
in that dress.

20:04.914 --> 20:08.209
In fact, she always
looked her best.

20:08.251 --> 20:10.293
Do you know that
she used to entertain...

20:10.335 --> 20:13.130
for royalty
and common folk and...

20:13.172 --> 20:15.006
even the President
of the United States.

20:17.092 --> 20:19.219
Ew.

20:21.263 --> 20:22.514
Oh!

20:22.556 --> 20:23.598
Oh, don't be frightened, child.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.726
This is just Mr. Kittles.

20:25.767 --> 20:28.187
He was the master's
favorite pet.

20:28.227 --> 20:30.688
He's been in the family
for generations.

20:30.730 --> 20:33.190
Look at him.
He hasn't aged a day.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.965
All right, child,
I think I'll take my leave.

20:37.002 --> 20:40.699
You let me know
if there's anything you need.

20:40.741 --> 20:42.575
Yes, and as you
can see, Professor...

20:42.617 --> 20:44.160
I've taken care
of everything...

20:44.202 --> 20:46.328
including medical supplies
and blood storage.

20:46.371 --> 20:47.913
We want to be safe.

20:47.955 --> 20:50.584
Are these cameras
all throughout the house?

20:50.625 --> 20:53.085
Yes, sir. I thought
that would be best.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.963
So if one of
our little chickadees...

20:55.005 --> 20:57.047
were to be taking a shower...

20:57.088 --> 20:59.216
which button would I press
to get a closeup?

20:59.258 --> 21:00.842
That one.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.095
This one? [ Beep ]

21:03.137 --> 21:04.763
Ha!

21:04.805 --> 21:06.181
Excuse me, Professor...

21:06.223 --> 21:09.936
but your guests
have begun to arrive...

21:09.978 --> 21:13.772
and supper
shall be served shortly.

21:13.814 --> 21:14.941
OK. Thanks, handyman.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.948
I'm actually the caretaker.

21:17.984 --> 21:21.112
Oh, aren't those
cool new skates?

21:21.154 --> 21:22.614
Now, you be careful
with those.

21:22.655 --> 21:24.616
Don't want to fall
and break something.

21:24.657 --> 21:25.909
Oh, that's funny.
That's real funny.

21:25.950 --> 21:29.580
Let me give you a hand.

21:29.621 --> 21:31.955
Well, that--that's
awful kind of you.

21:31.997 --> 21:34.251
How about you give me
a standing ovation?

21:34.292 --> 21:35.625
Why don't you lift me up?

21:35.667 --> 21:38.463
Oh! OK. I see where
you're going with this one.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.298
You look familiar to me.
Were you in "Stomp"?

21:41.340 --> 21:43.217
Hey, you can kiss my grits.

21:43.258 --> 21:45.344
I think I'll be the bigger man
now and walk away.

21:45.386 --> 21:47.554
Walk away.

21:47.596 --> 21:49.808
Um, I'll go
and change for dinner.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.266
- OK.
- I'll see you shortly.

21:51.308 --> 21:52.977
Sounds good.

21:53.019 --> 21:55.812
I'll just run upstairs
and jump into my jogging suit.

21:55.854 --> 21:56.813
I'll be right down.

21:58.774 --> 21:59.734
Hey!

21:59.776 --> 22:03.070
Hey there, little guy.
How you doing?

Fuck off, four eyes.

22:06.281 --> 22:07.491
I beg your pardon?

22:07.533 --> 22:11.037
I said,
"Fuck off, four eyes. "

22:12.371 --> 22:13.872
Oh, I ought to
kick your ass.

Relax, son.
It's just a bird.

Hello, birdie.
Polly want a cracker?

22:22.379 --> 22:24.507
Polly wants
your mama's sweet ass.

22:24.549 --> 22:26.259
What did Polly say to me?

22:26.300 --> 22:30.471
I said, "Polly wants
your mama's sweet ass. "

22:30.513 --> 22:32.641
You don't be talking
about my mama, son.

22:32.682 --> 22:33.980
You don't know my mama, son.

22:34.016 --> 22:36.143
Yeah, I know your mama.
I fucked her last night.

22:36.185 --> 22:38.188
You want beef?

23:01.169 --> 23:02.461
- Hey, Cin.
- How you doing?

23:02.503 --> 23:04.045
Open chest!

23:04.087 --> 23:07.508
Come on. You got to be
quicker than that, "A" cup.

23:07.549 --> 23:09.468
Oh! Oh!

23:10.677 --> 23:11.970
Hey, guys.

23:12.012 --> 23:13.305
- Hey!
- How you doing?

23:13.347 --> 23:15.348
Well, are you boys
just gonna sit there...

23:15.390 --> 23:16.808
with your mouths open...

23:16.850 --> 23:19.060
or is someone gonna
offer me a seat?

23:19.102 --> 23:20.437
Oh!

23:22.564 --> 23:23.647
Ow!

23:23.689 --> 23:25.317
I warmed it up for you.

23:25.358 --> 23:27.193
It's the best seat
in the house.

23:27.235 --> 23:28.527
Second best.

23:29.528 --> 23:30.821
Ew.

23:30.863 --> 23:33.158
Professor,
is this the same house...

23:33.199 --> 23:35.534
that a young girl
was possessed by a demon...

23:35.576 --> 23:36.703
or something?

23:36.744 --> 23:39.370
Yes, it was reported
but never substantiated.

23:44.252 --> 23:45.711
All right. Well, uh...

23:45.752 --> 23:47.380
who'd like some appetizers?

23:47.422 --> 23:48.713
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

23:48.755 --> 23:50.924
That's what I like to hear.

23:50.966 --> 23:53.260
Hey, these buns look good.

23:53.301 --> 23:54.261
Oh, yeah...

23:54.302 --> 23:55.784
and they're so soft and warm.

23:55.821 --> 23:57.265
- Ray!
- Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.725
These are delicious.

23:59.766 --> 24:01.351
Thank you, my child.

24:01.393 --> 24:03.687
I made them by hand.

24:03.728 --> 24:05.605
OK!

24:05.647 --> 24:09.734
Here we go. I think
the taters are just about done.

24:09.776 --> 24:13.863
I'm just gonna give them
one quick whisk here.

24:22.247 --> 24:25.249
OK, now. Dig in.

24:26.334 --> 24:27.543
All right.

24:27.584 --> 24:29.378
Now it's time for the turkey.

24:29.420 --> 24:31.297
Oh, what a beautiful bird.

24:31.339 --> 24:32.381
- No!
- No, man!

24:32.423 --> 24:34.092
Hey! Hey! Hey, man.

24:34.133 --> 24:35.093
Why don't you
just relax...

24:35.134 --> 24:36.594
and just let me
do that for you?

24:36.636 --> 24:39.388
- Yeah.
- Rest that little hand.

24:39.429 --> 24:41.766
It's my pleasure, but what
a nice young man to offer.

24:41.803 --> 24:44.142
Let me give you
a little pinch there.

24:44.184 --> 24:45.311
Come on.

24:45.353 --> 24:47.734
Fuck it!

24:47.770 --> 24:50.274
You know, a lot of people...

24:50.316 --> 24:52.108
are kind of intimidated...

24:52.150 --> 24:54.945
about making a turkey,
but...

24:54.987 --> 24:56.362
really it's very simple.

24:56.404 --> 24:59.073
You just have to know
the anatomy of a turkey...

24:59.115 --> 25:00.743
and it's got, over here...

25:00.784 --> 25:02.076
just the tiniest
little stinkhole...

25:02.118 --> 25:03.994
but it's big enough
to get your hand...

25:04.036 --> 25:05.581
right up inside it.

25:05.623 --> 25:07.790
Uh!

25:07.832 --> 25:10.335
Stuff the shit out of it.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.254
I cook it
with all the giblets--

25:12.295 --> 25:14.005
the penises
and the ginies...

25:14.047 --> 25:17.299
And now, a lot of people
like to baste their turkeys...

25:17.341 --> 25:19.594
but I use this.

25:19.636 --> 25:21.429
I lick like that...

25:21.471 --> 25:23.305
and get
into the little...

25:23.347 --> 25:25.266
hiney... hiney ho...

25:26.309 --> 25:27.769
That's nice and good.

25:27.811 --> 25:29.521
I don't know
what the hell that is...

25:29.561 --> 25:30.938
but I'll lick it anyway.

25:30.980 --> 25:32.272
Up and down...

25:32.314 --> 25:34.358
and then I like to get
that right on there...

25:37.277 --> 25:38.362
Hiawatha!

25:39.447 --> 25:40.864
And I got one of these.

25:40.906 --> 25:42.198
I'm gonna pull that off...

25:42.240 --> 25:44.201
and bam! That just
kicks it up a little bit.

25:44.243 --> 25:45.869
All right.
I think that's almost...

25:45.911 --> 25:47.204
ready now.

25:47.246 --> 25:49.623
And then we
bring it to the table.

25:49.660 --> 25:52.292
Mmm, good.

25:52.334 --> 25:54.002
All right.

25:54.044 --> 25:55.796
Who's ready for a wing?

25:55.838 --> 25:57.588
Yours or the turkey's?

25:57.630 --> 25:58.799
Ha, ha, ha!

25:58.840 --> 26:00.842
I just thought
that was funny.

26:00.884 --> 26:02.802
Well, I know what you'd like.

26:02.844 --> 26:04.304
How about a leg?

26:04.346 --> 26:07.349
Whoo!

26:07.390 --> 26:09.142
How about two? Ha ha!

26:09.183 --> 26:10.477
How about
I take these two legs...

26:10.519 --> 26:11.811
and shove
them right up your ass--

26:11.852 --> 26:12.937
all the way to the knee!

26:12.979 --> 26:14.982
Dwight. Dwight, relax.

26:15.018 --> 26:16.690
Hanson...

26:16.732 --> 26:19.444
may I ask you is there
something on the menu...

26:19.485 --> 26:22.405
that you haven't
personally prepared?

26:22.446 --> 26:25.950
Well, I ordered out
the dessert.

26:25.991 --> 26:27.409
All right!

26:27.451 --> 26:28.410
Make room.

26:28.452 --> 26:30.454
Here comes the pie.

26:30.496 --> 26:32.623
All right. OK. Mmm.

26:32.665 --> 26:35.813
Who wants the first piece
of that pie?

26:35.849 --> 26:38.962
Huh? I see you
eyeing the first piece.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.341
Oh, that's good.

26:42.382 --> 26:44.092
Mm mmm.
Pass that down to her.

26:44.134 --> 26:45.593
Thank you.

26:45.635 --> 26:47.137
That's nice.

26:47.179 --> 26:48.681
My germs.

26:48.718 --> 26:50.182
Ha, ha, ha!

26:50.223 --> 26:51.599
My germs.

26:51.641 --> 26:53.560
Ha, ha, ha! My germs!
Ha, ha, ha!

26:55.603 --> 26:56.563
Hey...

27:07.240 --> 27:11.370
Come play with me.

27:13.330 --> 27:16.499
Come play.

27:16.541 --> 27:18.835
Ha ha!

27:20.378 --> 27:22.087
Hello?

28:25.691 --> 28:26.650
Ooh!

28:35.200 --> 28:39.287
Cindy... Cindy.

28:39.329 --> 28:40.831
Who is it?

28:40.873 --> 28:42.791
I want to help you, Cindy.

28:42.833 --> 28:44.042
Who are you?

28:44.084 --> 28:46.211
You're in danger, Cindy.

28:46.253 --> 28:47.838
I want to help you.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.673
Help me how?
Who's in danger?

28:50.715 --> 28:53.593
Check the music room.

28:53.635 --> 28:55.011
Where are you?

28:55.053 --> 28:57.890
Check
the fucking music room!

28:59.558 --> 29:01.268
Hey, Cindy, think fast!

29:01.309 --> 29:04.229
Ohh! Uhh! Aah!

29:04.270 --> 29:06.189
Dude, you suck!

29:06.231 --> 29:07.607
Ow.

29:08.691 --> 29:10.485
Buddy...

29:10.527 --> 29:11.944
about
this friendship thing--

29:11.986 --> 29:14.655
Yeah, I think it is so cool
having a girl as a friend.

29:14.697 --> 29:16.365
That's just it, Buddy.

29:16.407 --> 29:18.033
I am a girl.

29:18.075 --> 29:19.874
You can't be so rough
with me.

29:19.910 --> 29:21.746
Well, then what the hell
are we supposed to do?

29:21.781 --> 29:24.165
Gentle stuff.

29:24.206 --> 29:26.292
You know, like talking and...

29:26.334 --> 29:29.294
sharing secrets
and past experiences.

29:29.336 --> 29:31.838
You know, stuff like that.

29:31.875 --> 29:34.341
That sounds kind of gay.

29:34.383 --> 29:36.551
I guess since you're a girl
it's all right.

29:36.593 --> 29:39.137
- Yeah. It'll be fine.
- All right.

29:39.179 --> 29:41.599
Hey, listen. Will you come
check something out with me?

29:41.636 --> 29:43.850
Sure. We can practice
our talking.

29:43.891 --> 29:45.232
Yeah. Exactly.

29:45.269 --> 29:46.353
I want to tell you
about this thing...

29:46.395 --> 29:47.770
that happened to me
when I was in high school.

29:47.812 --> 29:49.273
Really? What happened?

29:49.314 --> 29:51.650
This hot Spanish chick's
licking my nuts--

29:51.692 --> 29:52.650
Buddy!

29:52.693 --> 29:54.611
No, no.
This is the best part.

29:54.653 --> 29:55.904
Oh, my God. Look.

29:55.945 --> 29:59.156
Oh, dude!
Someone's on the rag!

29:59.198 --> 30:00.826
Shh!

30:00.867 --> 30:03.076
They lead straight
to the bookcase.

30:15.130 --> 30:17.174
God.

30:17.216 --> 30:20.470
Must be a secret study
or something.

30:30.354 --> 30:32.647
Wow.

30:40.322 --> 30:41.947
Oh, my God.

30:41.989 --> 30:43.575
It says Hugh Kane
and his mistress...

30:43.617 --> 30:45.243
were murdered
in this house.

30:45.285 --> 30:47.161
Whoa. Check this out.

30:50.499 --> 30:51.790
This must be his wife.

30:51.832 --> 30:54.126
Oh, my God.
She looks just like you.

30:54.168 --> 30:55.713
You think?

30:55.754 --> 30:58.214
- She's really beautiful.
- Yeah.

30:58.256 --> 31:00.216
Well, actually,
her hair doesn't have...

31:00.258 --> 31:02.052
as many split ends as yours...

31:02.093 --> 31:03.970
and her skin isn't
as oily as yours, either.

31:04.012 --> 31:06.264
Also, sometimes your eyes
get kind of squinty...

31:06.299 --> 31:08.515
and you look like
you might have Down Syndrome.

31:08.557 --> 31:10.352
Other than that, though,
the resemblance is uncanny.

31:10.393 --> 31:12.775
Really?

31:12.811 --> 31:14.111
Also, her tits are perfect.

31:14.147 --> 31:15.397
They're not pointy
or funny-looking like yours...

31:15.439 --> 31:16.607
or spaced too far apart.

31:16.648 --> 31:19.944
OK! Enough!

31:19.986 --> 31:22.112
God.

31:22.154 --> 31:24.531
Oh, my God, look at this.

31:26.158 --> 31:28.076
"Caroline. "

31:28.118 --> 31:30.288
Must have been hers.

31:32.790 --> 31:33.749
Oh, my God.

31:33.791 --> 31:34.750
All right.
Let's get out of here.

31:34.792 --> 31:35.917
This place
gives me the creeps.

31:35.958 --> 31:37.461
OK. Grab the chest.

31:37.503 --> 31:38.837
Oh, thanks.

31:38.879 --> 31:40.130
- Buddy!
- What?

31:40.172 --> 31:42.590
- I meant the chest.
- Right.

32:21.127 --> 32:22.462
What the--

32:31.096 --> 32:33.015
Hey.

32:35.225 --> 32:36.184
Nice.

32:38.896 --> 32:41.481
Mm-hmm...

32:41.522 --> 32:45.234
Mmm... mmm.

32:50.031 --> 32:51.720
Oh!

32:51.757 --> 32:53.409
Oh! OK!

32:53.451 --> 32:55.035
Hello!

32:55.077 --> 32:56.871
If I had known,
I would have freshened up!

32:56.907 --> 32:58.498
I wish you were
freshened up, too.

32:58.540 --> 32:59.540
Get up there! Come on!

32:59.576 --> 33:00.558
Oh, you want this?

33:00.595 --> 33:01.570
Oh, yeah. Ooh, yeah.

33:01.606 --> 33:02.507
That's it, daddy.

33:02.544 --> 33:03.877
Take it like you want it.

33:03.919 --> 33:05.046
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

33:05.088 --> 33:06.839
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

33:06.880 --> 33:08.007
Yeah!

33:08.049 --> 33:09.091
Come here!

33:09.133 --> 33:10.426
Bring it on!

33:10.468 --> 33:12.010
Kinky's my middle name, bitch!

33:12.052 --> 33:13.887
Ooh, yeah!

33:13.929 --> 33:17.016
That was the best
that I've ever had.

33:17.058 --> 33:18.392
Oh. Mrs. Huey Kane.

33:18.428 --> 33:19.934
Hmm?

33:19.976 --> 33:20.936
Doesn't that just
have a ring to it?

33:20.978 --> 33:24.856
Ha ha! Mmm... baby?

33:24.898 --> 33:27.067
Where you going?

33:27.109 --> 33:29.653
Call me!

33:36.618 --> 33:38.037
Let's do something freaky.

33:38.077 --> 33:41.164
Hee hee!
Like what, Ray?

33:41.206 --> 33:42.666
I don't know.

33:42.708 --> 33:45.459
Why don't you
talk dirty to me?

33:45.496 --> 33:48.213
I don't know
what to say, Ray.

33:48.255 --> 33:50.422
Come on.
Just make something up.

33:52.175 --> 33:55.052
Oh, Ray,
why do you make me so bad?

33:55.094 --> 33:58.013
Come on.
Because you a bad girl.

33:58.055 --> 33:59.807
OK.

34:01.433 --> 34:02.434
I'm gonna work this.

34:02.471 --> 34:04.394
Yeah. Work it.

34:04.436 --> 34:06.146
I'm gonna make this mine.

34:06.188 --> 34:08.565
Mmm. It's all yours.
Oh, yeah.

34:08.606 --> 34:10.192
I'm gonna
piss on your face...

34:10.234 --> 34:11.819
and then I'm gonna fart
in your mouth.

34:11.860 --> 34:14.070
Yeah! And then I'm gonna
shit on these walls, Ray!

34:14.112 --> 34:15.614
Ooh!

34:15.650 --> 34:17.116
Hey!

34:17.158 --> 34:19.034
Too dirty?

34:23.830 --> 34:26.083
Hello?

34:30.379 --> 34:32.755
Oh, hey, kitty, kitty.

34:32.797 --> 34:34.382
Hi, little fella.

34:39.012 --> 34:40.471
Aah! Aah! Aah!

34:46.101 --> 34:48.728
OK. OK.

34:48.770 --> 34:50.106
That's OK, cat.

34:52.524 --> 34:57.410
I think I know
why you're mad, Mr. Cat.

34:57.446 --> 35:00.450
I didn't mean to go poopie
in your litter box.

35:06.831 --> 35:10.626
Help!
My pussy's gone crazy!

35:10.662 --> 35:13.295
Aah! Aah!

35:21.386 --> 35:23.387
Ha, ha, ha!

35:27.476 --> 35:29.102
Aah!

35:29.144 --> 35:31.355
Oh! Aah! Aah!

35:39.279 --> 35:41.655
OK. You want a piece of me?

35:41.697 --> 35:43.199
Huh?

35:44.283 --> 35:46.661
Yeah! How do you like that,
little pussy?

35:46.703 --> 35:48.162
Come on!

35:49.663 --> 35:52.249
Yeah! Yeah! Come on!

35:52.291 --> 35:54.336
Aah! Ohh!

35:54.377 --> 35:56.795
Is that all you got?

35:56.836 --> 35:58.547
Huh? Come on!

35:58.589 --> 35:59.757
Give me your best shot!

36:15.522 --> 36:17.106
I'm telling you,
Professor...

36:17.148 --> 36:18.817
it was possessed.

36:18.859 --> 36:20.777
Theo, did you see
this animal?

36:20.818 --> 36:21.987
No, I didn't.

36:22.028 --> 36:23.362
I heard
all the commotion...

36:23.404 --> 36:24.656
but by the time
I went in there...

36:24.697 --> 36:26.407
I guess it was gone.

36:27.575 --> 36:28.789
Mm-hmm.

36:28.826 --> 36:30.828
What? So you think
I did this to myself?.

36:30.870 --> 36:33.165
No. All I'm saying
is that cats are known...

36:33.206 --> 36:35.250
to be very
territorial animals...

36:35.291 --> 36:37.293
and it's likely
that it did attack...

36:37.335 --> 36:40.004
but that doesn't mean
it was possessed.

36:41.506 --> 36:45.551
Maybe you two should
sleep together.

36:45.592 --> 36:48.011
What are you getting at,
Professor?

36:48.053 --> 36:51.390
I'm just saying that if indeed
this cat did attack...

36:51.431 --> 36:55.144
it's less likely to come back
if the two of you were...

36:55.186 --> 36:57.521
let's say... together.

36:58.647 --> 37:00.691
Oh, come on, it's college.

37:00.733 --> 37:02.776
It's time for you two
to experiment.

37:02.818 --> 37:05.862
I don't think we're gonna
be getting much help here.

37:05.904 --> 37:06.988
Oh, on the contrary,
actually...

37:07.030 --> 37:08.866
I'd be more than happy
to walk you through it.

37:08.907 --> 37:09.866
Come on, Cin.

37:09.908 --> 37:10.866
I'll make sure
you get tucked in.

37:10.908 --> 37:12.745
Good idea.

37:12.787 --> 37:15.706
Don't forget to kiss
each other good night.

37:15.748 --> 37:18.417
There's something going on
in this house, Professor.

37:18.458 --> 37:20.377
I'm not crazy!

37:20.418 --> 37:22.963
Aah!

37:23.005 --> 37:25.130
1, 2...

37:25.172 --> 37:31.137
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

37:31.179 --> 37:33.139
9, Brandon, 10...

37:33.181 --> 37:35.766
11, Brandon, come on!
Count with me!

37:54.077 --> 37:57.001
Hey, you.
Hee, hee, hee, hee!

37:57.037 --> 38:01.667
Come here a minute.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

38:01.709 --> 38:03.340
Come here.

38:03.377 --> 38:05.880
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

38:08.882 --> 38:11.802
Peekaboo!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

38:14.178 --> 38:16.682
Come on, let's play!

38:16.724 --> 38:19.516
This is a fun game, huh?

38:19.558 --> 38:21.186
Hey, what are you doing?

38:21.227 --> 38:22.687
Uncle Ray-Ray's got a game.

38:22.729 --> 38:23.895
Hey, get your finger
out of there.

38:23.937 --> 38:25.273
Tickle, tickle,
tickle, tickle...

38:25.315 --> 38:27.197
Aah! Aah!

38:27.233 --> 38:28.610
You want to play
with Uncle Ray?

38:28.652 --> 38:31.487
Peekaboo!
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

38:31.528 --> 38:33.822
Aah! Aah! Help!

38:33.864 --> 38:35.740
Aah!

38:35.782 --> 38:36.951
Oh, God!

38:36.993 --> 38:38.535
RAY: Here's
a little balloon animal.

38:38.577 --> 38:40.162
Da, da, da, da, da
da, da, da, da!

38:40.204 --> 38:42.040
Ohh!

38:50.713 --> 38:53.716
CINDY, VOICE-OVER? "I can't take
living with him any longer.

38:53.758 --> 38:55.845
"He's becoming a monster.

38:55.886 --> 38:58.721
"I suspect he was
having an affair.

38:58.763 --> 39:01.475
"I believe he's sleeping
with our baby-sitter Victoria.

39:01.517 --> 39:02.936
"It must be why
he keeps her around...

39:02.972 --> 39:05.687
"because we have
no children. "

39:05.728 --> 39:07.565
Cindy...

39:07.607 --> 39:10.860
I want you to know
what happened, Cindy.

39:19.617 --> 39:21.119
Hello, Cindy.

39:21.161 --> 39:22.953
Hello, Professor.

39:31.505 --> 39:33.380
I take it you're not
mad at me anymore.

39:33.422 --> 39:36.842
I wouldn't go that far,
Professor.

39:36.884 --> 39:38.427
Why don't you just relax?

39:38.468 --> 39:40.429
Hey!

39:40.470 --> 39:41.765
Uh, uh...

39:41.806 --> 39:43.598
Aha.

39:43.640 --> 39:45.059
Ha ha.

39:49.104 --> 39:50.439
Uh-huh.

39:55.777 --> 39:58.030
I think she's starting
to suspect something.

39:58.071 --> 39:59.323
Who?

40:01.742 --> 40:02.700
Your wife.

40:02.742 --> 40:05.245
Aah!

40:07.914 --> 40:09.875
Oh, my God.

40:09.916 --> 40:11.084
It happened right here.

40:11.126 --> 40:12.085
What?

40:12.126 --> 40:13.545
She came home.

40:13.587 --> 40:15.046
- She saw them!
- Saw who?

40:15.087 --> 40:17.757
I was in my room
reading her journal.

40:17.798 --> 40:21.052
Then I found this dress
in the closet.

40:21.094 --> 40:23.721
That's all I remember.

40:23.763 --> 40:25.223
What about you, Ray?

40:25.265 --> 40:27.057
Oh, I bought mine
on Friday.

40:27.099 --> 40:29.227
I just came down
to get a banana.

40:29.268 --> 40:30.853
Shit is hot, right?

40:31.937 --> 40:33.814
You're a nice little plant.

40:33.856 --> 40:36.484
You drink all this
little water up...

40:36.526 --> 40:39.362
so you can grow up to be
a nice strong charon plant.

40:39.404 --> 40:41.196
Yes. Yes.

40:41.238 --> 40:43.324
And then you'll be smoked
by all the rappers...

40:43.365 --> 40:45.409
and make them do
a whole lot of dumb shit...

40:45.451 --> 40:46.868
that fuck up their careers.

40:46.910 --> 40:48.704
Yes, you will.

40:50.372 --> 40:52.666
Night-night, baby.

41:02.301 --> 41:05.220
I'm gonna rob
that bitch tonight.

41:13.812 --> 41:16.063
Lockdown Records presents...

41:16.104 --> 41:17.732
A Hip-Hop Christmas.

41:17.774 --> 41:19.026
You'll get such classics...

41:19.066 --> 41:20.652
As "Santa Claus
Is Coming on Moms... "

41:20.694 --> 41:22.486
That's the shit, son!

41:22.528 --> 41:24.488
"I'm Dreaming
of a White Woman... "

41:24.530 --> 41:26.658
and who could forget
"Frosty the Dopeman"?

41:26.698 --> 41:28.658
And how about
"All I want for Christmas...

41:28.700 --> 41:29.911
Is the Charges Dropped... "

41:29.953 --> 41:32.120
"Deez Nuts Roasting
On an Open Fire... "

41:32.162 --> 41:34.039
"A Sleigh Ride In My '64... "

41:34.081 --> 41:35.707
"Ante Up, Bitch,
It's Christmas... "

41:35.749 --> 41:36.709
and many more!

41:36.750 --> 41:39.128
Yo, I'm gonna buy
that shit, son!

41:39.170 --> 41:41.130
Just $19. 95...

41:46.926 --> 41:47.969
Aah!

41:49.180 --> 41:51.639
I'm sorry! I didn't mean
to smoke your relatives!

41:51.681 --> 41:53.350
Please! No!

41:53.392 --> 41:54.643
I didn't do it by myself!

41:54.685 --> 41:55.852
Whitney and Bobby helped me!

41:55.893 --> 41:57.813
Please! Help me!

41:57.855 --> 42:00.190
Aah! Shit, son!

42:00.232 --> 42:01.817
Wait! No! Please!

42:01.857 --> 42:04.737
Oh! Oh, shit, son!

42:04.779 --> 42:06.153
Oh, shit!

42:06.195 --> 42:07.739
Oh, my God!

42:10.408 --> 42:12.994
Aah! Oh, shit!
I smell something burning!

42:14.537 --> 42:16.414
Oh, stop! It's me!

42:16.455 --> 42:18.874
I got an idea!

42:18.916 --> 42:20.668
Oh, wait a second!

42:20.710 --> 42:22.169
Hold on, Shorty!

42:22.211 --> 42:23.380
Don't rescue me yet.

42:23.421 --> 42:25.255
I'm getting high
as a motherfucker!

42:25.297 --> 42:26.883
Toke, toke, toke, toke!

42:26.924 --> 42:29.010
Take it to the head!
Take it to the head!

42:30.344 --> 42:32.013
Oh, you take it
like a bitch.

42:32.054 --> 42:33.681
Put the Shorty down...

42:33.722 --> 42:35.849
and I'll give you
Funyons and Cheetos.

42:38.728 --> 42:42.021
Oh, shit!

42:42.063 --> 42:44.066
This shit burns
more than a perm!

42:45.233 --> 42:46.735
Aah!

42:48.904 --> 42:50.864
Ha, ha, ha!

42:52.281 --> 42:53.533
There's a whole lot
of freaky shit...

42:53.575 --> 42:55.618
going on in this house.

42:55.660 --> 42:58.038
There's more to this story
than the Professor told us.

42:58.080 --> 43:00.956
Last night,
I found a secret room...

43:00.998 --> 43:03.251
and I found all these
newspaper clippings...

43:03.293 --> 43:04.293
about Hugh Kane.

43:04.334 --> 43:07.255
He was a really evil man.

43:07.296 --> 43:11.258
And I found a picture
of his wife.

43:11.300 --> 43:13.720
Oh, my God!
She looks just like you.

43:13.762 --> 43:14.887
You think?

43:14.928 --> 43:17.390
She doesn't have
as many split ends...

43:17.432 --> 43:19.725
and her skin's
not as oily as yours.

43:19.767 --> 43:21.357
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

43:21.394 --> 43:23.020
Sometimes you do this little
squinty thing with your eyes.

43:23.062 --> 43:25.022
It looks like you got
Down Syndrome or something.

43:25.106 --> 43:27.190
Oh, yeah,
y'all look just alike...

43:27.232 --> 43:29.568
except she got
some perfect boobs...

43:29.610 --> 43:31.570
and yours look like
them old orangutan titties.

43:31.607 --> 43:33.614
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
Shit, son!

43:33.656 --> 43:36.701
I'll put you in the full nelson
and lick them.

43:36.743 --> 43:38.369
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

43:38.411 --> 43:43.081
OK! Enough!

43:43.123 --> 43:45.626
Anyway, I think
she killed him...

43:45.667 --> 43:46.709
and now he wants me.

43:46.751 --> 43:48.587
Yeah. Right, bitch.

44:05.102 --> 44:06.687
Morning, Dwight.
Let me help you.

44:06.729 --> 44:07.981
I don't need your help.

44:08.022 --> 44:09.398
I can do it myself.

44:09.440 --> 44:12.110
Aah!

44:13.693 --> 44:17.448
OK. Professor,
uh, we need to talk.

44:17.490 --> 44:18.783
What is it, Dwight?

44:18.825 --> 44:19.908
I think
you should consider...

44:19.950 --> 44:21.827
cutting the experiment short.

44:21.869 --> 44:23.286
What?

44:23.328 --> 44:25.789
This poltergeist is growing
increasingly more violent.

44:25.825 --> 44:27.375
I think we're all
in danger here...

44:27.417 --> 44:29.250
and I've got to put
my foot down...

44:29.292 --> 44:30.961
and stand up for
what I believe in...

44:30.998 --> 44:32.629
and say that
we've got to pull the plug.

44:32.671 --> 44:34.923
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Dwight.

44:34.965 --> 44:36.841
I say when we pull the plug.

44:36.883 --> 44:39.386
We are on the verge
of greatness...

44:39.428 --> 44:42.805
and I am this close
to getting laid.

44:42.847 --> 44:44.307
Now, the bus arrives
on Monday.

44:44.349 --> 44:46.273
No one leaves till then.

44:46.310 --> 44:48.311
Here are
the keys to the gate.

44:48.353 --> 44:51.065
No one gets access to them.

44:51.105 --> 44:53.066
Yes, sir.

44:54.317 --> 44:57.445
Guys, I think
the Professor's up to something.

44:57.486 --> 44:59.113
I heard Dwight
tell the Professor...

44:59.155 --> 45:00.447
there could be
a poltergeist in the house...

45:00.489 --> 45:02.658
and that we could all
be in danger!

45:02.699 --> 45:04.494
Oh, no, son!
Not a poltergeist!

45:05.828 --> 45:07.288
What's a poltergeist?

45:07.329 --> 45:08.414
I'm getting out of here.

45:08.498 --> 45:10.040
No. We can't go anywhere.
The gates are locked.

45:10.082 --> 45:11.626
Dwight's the only one
who has the keys.

45:11.668 --> 45:13.628
- Baby, get my Vaseline.
- I'll handle--

45:13.669 --> 45:16.005
Get my Vaseline, a banana,
and some duct tape.

45:16.047 --> 45:17.006
I'm gonna break his legs.

45:17.047 --> 45:18.549
I'm gonna fuck
that little cripple up!

45:18.591 --> 45:21.761
Guys, just give me
five minutes alone with him.

45:21.803 --> 45:23.678
I'll get the keys.

45:29.101 --> 45:31.019
Hello, Dwight.

45:31.061 --> 45:33.396
Oh.

45:33.438 --> 45:35.274
Hi, Theo.

45:37.275 --> 45:38.567
What you working on?

45:38.609 --> 45:43.157
Uh, just a little experiment.

45:43.199 --> 45:46.659
Oh. Work, work, work.

45:46.700 --> 45:47.786
Is that all you ever do?

45:47.828 --> 45:52.081
Well, there's a lot
riding on this project.

45:52.123 --> 45:54.000
You know, the Professor...

45:54.041 --> 45:55.711
might have
everyone else fooled...

45:55.753 --> 45:58.338
but I know
who the real brains...

45:58.380 --> 46:00.882
behind this operation is.

46:00.924 --> 46:03.843
Oh, yeah? You do, huh?

46:03.884 --> 46:07.055
Mm-hmm. That's what
turns me on about you.

46:07.095 --> 46:08.889
You're so smart.

46:08.931 --> 46:10.141
Ahh.

46:10.183 --> 46:13.560
And those sexy eyes.

46:13.602 --> 46:15.729
Ha ha. Oh!

46:18.065 --> 46:19.900
Why don't I put
some music on, huh?

46:19.942 --> 46:23.111
Yeah. Music.

46:24.738 --> 46:25.740
Wha--

46:25.781 --> 46:27.740
You know, Dwight...

46:27.782 --> 46:28.991
I hear
you're the only one...

46:29.033 --> 46:31.286
who has
the keys to the gate.

46:31.327 --> 46:32.621
Uhh...

46:34.790 --> 46:36.958
Ha. That's true.
It is. I'm--

46:37.000 --> 46:38.294
Correct.

46:38.334 --> 46:39.794
What if...

46:41.213 --> 46:43.339
I wanted to borrow
those keys?

46:43.381 --> 46:48.177
Oh, dear sweet God in Heaven.

46:49.763 --> 46:51.430
I... yaaa, I can't.

46:51.472 --> 46:54.142
Oh, come on.
Yes, you can, baby.

46:54.184 --> 46:55.814
- No.
- Please? I mean--

46:55.851 --> 46:59.898
Look. You help me
by giving me the keys...

46:59.940 --> 47:03.275
and I'll help by giving you...
[ Zip ]

47:03.317 --> 47:04.944
Hey, wait, wait, wait!
Whoa!

47:04.986 --> 47:07.321
Hey, I don't need
your help, OK, lady?

47:08.531 --> 47:10.033
I can do it myself.

47:14.244 --> 47:16.080
Woo-hoo!

47:16.121 --> 47:17.081
Hey, look!

47:17.122 --> 47:18.290
I'm tossing my own salad!

47:18.332 --> 47:19.876
Ow!

47:29.009 --> 47:30.718
Oh.

47:32.804 --> 47:35.682
So this is your secret room.

47:37.684 --> 47:40.060
Well...

47:40.102 --> 47:42.355
this just isn't
gonna work now, is it?

47:44.191 --> 47:48.403
Oh, Professor.

47:49.736 --> 47:52.990
Come over here.

47:54.909 --> 47:57.203
Uh-huh!

47:57.245 --> 48:00.915
This way, you big hunk.

48:00.956 --> 48:02.417
Ahem.

48:04.417 --> 48:06.504
Have we met?

48:06.546 --> 48:09.048
Follow me.

48:09.089 --> 48:10.841
Are you playing
a little game?

48:10.882 --> 48:12.259
Where are you?

48:12.300 --> 48:15.553
Come here, baby.

48:15.595 --> 48:17.432
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

48:21.310 --> 48:24.772
No!

48:26.273 --> 48:27.024
Aah!

48:27.065 --> 48:28.316
- Is everybody here?
- Yeah.

48:28.359 --> 48:30.068
All right. Let's go.

48:30.110 --> 48:31.695
- Oh!
- Oh, shit, son!

48:35.447 --> 48:37.743
He's not gonna
let us out of here!

48:37.784 --> 48:38.909
He's gonna kill us!

48:38.951 --> 48:41.371
Oh, look.
A rocket scientist.

48:41.412 --> 48:43.080
All right. Quick.
Everybody to the laboratory.

48:43.122 --> 48:46.167
Move! Come on! Hurry up!

48:46.209 --> 48:47.961
You all are fucked!

48:50.129 --> 48:52.215
Lock the door.

48:52.257 --> 48:54.508
OK. We have to destroy it.

48:54.550 --> 48:55.552
That's great.

48:55.593 --> 48:57.344
How are we gonna destroy
what we can't see?

48:57.386 --> 48:58.887
I got it!

48:58.929 --> 49:00.514
We'll shave off
our pubic hairs...

49:00.556 --> 49:03.643
and wear the shampoo
for two weeks!

49:03.684 --> 49:04.894
No. Listen. Listen.

49:04.935 --> 49:06.562
We're gonna use these guns.

49:06.604 --> 49:09.523
They emit a bolt
of concentrated energy...

49:09.565 --> 49:12.067
which can damage
the ectoplasmic cells...

49:12.109 --> 49:13.401
and destroy the ghost.

49:13.443 --> 49:15.612
Now, there's no more ammunition.

49:15.654 --> 49:16.906
Conserve it. Use it wisely.

49:16.947 --> 49:18.407
- Shut up.
- Ow!

49:18.449 --> 49:21.284
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

49:21.326 --> 49:24.620
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Conserve your ammunition.

49:24.657 --> 49:26.707
My bad.

49:26.749 --> 49:27.875
All right.
Now, the only way...

49:27.916 --> 49:29.291
we're gonna be able
to track these ghosts...

49:29.333 --> 49:31.586
is if we're all wearing
one of these.

49:31.628 --> 49:32.754
These are thermo goggles.

49:32.796 --> 49:34.714
They work on the principle
of body heat.

49:34.756 --> 49:36.924
They're so powerful,
they can detect...

49:36.966 --> 49:38.551
where any bodily fluids
have been...

49:38.593 --> 49:40.470
even if
they've been wiped clean.

49:44.390 --> 49:45.392
What?

49:45.434 --> 49:47.436
Ew.

49:47.476 --> 49:49.854
Are my glasses crooked?

49:49.896 --> 49:52.939
Now listen,
that ghost may be invisible...

49:52.981 --> 49:54.692
but we have the advantage
of being armed...

49:54.734 --> 49:56.652
with the most sophisticated
high-tech equipment...

49:56.688 --> 49:57.819
known to man.

49:57.861 --> 49:59.030
How do we stay in touch
with each other?

49:59.070 --> 50:00.907
Do we have
some walkie-talkies?

50:00.949 --> 50:02.782
No. We have these.

50:04.827 --> 50:06.287
Those is Dixie cups.

50:06.329 --> 50:08.413
Well, we kind
of ran short of funds...

50:08.455 --> 50:12.459
after the guns
and the goggles.

50:12.501 --> 50:14.419
All right.
Now let's split up.

50:14.461 --> 50:16.547
Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Uh-uh!

50:16.589 --> 50:18.298
Now wait a minute!
Hold up!

50:18.339 --> 50:20.134
How come every time
some scary shit happens...

50:20.176 --> 50:21.886
that we need
to stick together...

50:21.927 --> 50:23.970
you white people always say,
"Let's split up"?

50:24.012 --> 50:25.430
She's right.
We should stick together.

50:25.472 --> 50:27.265
Yes!
That's what I'm saying!

50:27.306 --> 50:28.308
She's right.

50:28.349 --> 50:31.562
OK. You three, follow me.

50:37.733 --> 50:39.694
Ain't that a bitch?

50:43.322 --> 50:45.158
We're gonna die, y'all.

50:54.125 --> 50:56.501
Ah. Did you hear that?

50:56.543 --> 50:57.502
Hell, yeah.

50:57.544 --> 51:00.839
Oh! Where's Shorty?

51:00.876 --> 51:02.383
I don't know.

51:02.425 --> 51:08.013
Shorty!

51:09.014 --> 51:09.974
Oh.

51:10.016 --> 51:11.975
Damn.

51:12.017 --> 51:14.020
All right.
You wait right here.

51:14.062 --> 51:15.021
I'll be right back.

51:15.062 --> 51:17.021
- OK.
- All right.

51:25.739 --> 51:27.824
- Wow.
- What is this?

51:27.865 --> 51:29.826
I don't know.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.663
Looks like the furnace room.

51:33.705 --> 51:35.248
- Let's go.
- No, wait.

51:35.290 --> 51:36.671
In that newspaper article...

51:36.706 --> 51:39.001
it said that Hugh Kane
was killed in the furnace.

51:44.215 --> 51:48.594
Oh, wow. Look at this.

51:48.636 --> 51:50.679
There's so many ashes, Buddy.

51:53.808 --> 51:55.184
What are you doing?

51:55.226 --> 51:56.352
Hold it.

51:56.393 --> 51:59.271
Aah!

52:01.064 --> 52:02.191
Aah!

52:03.818 --> 52:05.902
Let's split up.
I'll meet you on the other end.

52:05.944 --> 52:08.114
- OK.
- Wait.

52:08.156 --> 52:10.198
Good luck.

52:10.240 --> 52:12.158
I love you!

52:20.208 --> 52:21.334
Aah!

52:21.376 --> 52:22.752
- Oh, Shorty!
- Cindy!

52:22.793 --> 52:24.254
There's a monster chasing me.

52:24.296 --> 52:26.589
What are we gonna do?

52:26.630 --> 52:28.967
- I got it!
- Yeah?

52:29.009 --> 52:30.384
Oh!

52:32.803 --> 52:36.849
Shorty!

52:37.850 --> 52:39.353
Aah!

52:42.772 --> 52:44.398
Damn. Why does
the little bitch...

52:44.440 --> 52:46.776
got to bring that shit
over here?

52:46.817 --> 52:49.528
OK. Well, maybe
she won't see me.

52:49.570 --> 52:52.239
Somebody help me! Brenda!

52:54.741 --> 52:56.869
Shit, she saw me.

52:56.910 --> 52:58.287
OK. OK.

52:58.329 --> 52:59.830
Oh! Aah!

52:59.871 --> 53:01.330
Ohh!

53:01.372 --> 53:03.792
Thank you, Lord!

53:05.126 --> 53:06.128
Aah!

53:06.170 --> 53:07.712
OK. Now let
that shit just--

53:07.754 --> 53:10.215
just mutilate
her white ass and leave.

53:14.677 --> 53:17.561
Damn, bitch, please die!

53:17.597 --> 53:20.307
Oh, my God, Brenda!
We're gonna die!

53:20.349 --> 53:21.393
It would have
just been you...

53:21.435 --> 53:23.937
if you had just
shut the fuck up!

53:23.978 --> 53:25.500
It's coming!

53:25.537 --> 53:27.023
What is it?

53:27.065 --> 53:30.401
Is it a monster?
Is it a monster?

53:33.571 --> 53:35.948
Cindy?

53:35.990 --> 53:38.660
This is a skeleton.
This is bones.

53:38.701 --> 53:41.120
Would you run
from Calista Flockhart?

53:43.289 --> 53:44.873
Shut your ass up.

53:46.458 --> 53:48.752
Ha, ha, ha!

53:48.793 --> 53:51.673
Look. He crazy now.

53:51.715 --> 53:53.840
I'm sorry, Mr. Skeleton.
Here.

53:53.882 --> 53:57.136
Ha! Gotcha! Psych!

53:57.177 --> 53:58.386
Have a nice trip.

53:58.428 --> 54:02.224
Ha, ha, ha!

54:02.266 --> 54:03.808
Hey, girl, I got an idea.

54:03.850 --> 54:05.059
Come on.

54:06.394 --> 54:08.813
SKELETON?
Ha ha. Very funny.

54:08.855 --> 54:10.689
Whoo!

54:10.731 --> 54:12.067
Ooh!

54:12.109 --> 54:14.193
Ha, ha, ha!

54:14.235 --> 54:15.862
Now get on out of here!

54:15.904 --> 54:17.405
Somebody gonna
catch an ass-whupping...

54:17.447 --> 54:18.698
when I come back.

54:18.740 --> 54:21.201
Oh, Brenda,
you are so brave.

54:21.243 --> 54:23.870
You know, you really are
my best friend, Cindy.

54:23.911 --> 54:24.871
You guys OK?

54:24.912 --> 54:26.247
- Yeah.
- Please.

54:26.289 --> 54:29.416
It takes more than a little bag
of bones to scare me.

54:29.458 --> 54:30.626
Wedgie!

54:30.663 --> 54:31.758
Ha, ha, ha!

54:31.795 --> 54:33.128
The ghost has Buddy!

54:33.164 --> 54:34.506
Ah! My ass!

54:34.546 --> 54:36.215
Brenda, do something!

54:36.257 --> 54:38.175
OK!

54:38.217 --> 54:39.718
Aah!

54:39.760 --> 54:41.554
I thought
I was your best friend.

54:41.596 --> 54:42.722
Was.

54:42.764 --> 54:44.723
I'm gonna miss you, girl!

54:46.225 --> 54:47.850
Get my gun!

54:58.152 --> 54:59.321
Oh!

55:00.823 --> 55:02.615
Are you OK?

55:02.657 --> 55:03.700
Ow.

55:03.741 --> 55:05.076
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.

55:05.118 --> 55:07.120
Come on. I think there's
a first-aid kit in the lab.

55:07.162 --> 55:08.746
Come on.

55:14.336 --> 55:16.880
Ooh!

55:25.096 --> 55:29.058
Huey... baby...

55:29.100 --> 55:31.018
where are you?

55:34.855 --> 55:37.441
My love? Are you there?

55:40.361 --> 55:42.863
Huey? Baby!

55:42.904 --> 55:45.240
Baby, I got
to talk to you.

55:45.282 --> 55:48.576
- No. Go away!
- Baby? Oh!

55:48.618 --> 55:49.828
Get away from me!

55:49.869 --> 55:52.538
Come on, baby.
We can work this out.

55:54.834 --> 55:56.959
I mean,
if we just stick together...

55:57.001 --> 55:58.796
no one can hurt us,
my love.

55:58.837 --> 56:01.131
It was just a booty call!

56:02.465 --> 56:04.842
Ow! Ooh! Ow! Oh!

56:04.879 --> 56:05.807
Aah!

56:05.843 --> 56:08.554
Why won't you talk to me?

56:08.596 --> 56:09.847
Because you gave me crabs.

56:09.889 --> 56:12.016
Aah!

56:16.021 --> 56:18.940
You are the weakest link.
Good-bye!

56:21.026 --> 56:22.318
Aah!

56:24.654 --> 56:27.494
Ooh. Hey.

56:27.531 --> 56:30.118
How you doing?
Ha, ha, ha!

56:35.540 --> 56:36.873
Aah!

56:40.920 --> 56:42.922
No, no. No kissing.
No kissing.

56:45.592 --> 56:47.383
No. Leave this on.
Leave this on.

56:47.425 --> 56:48.677
You look beautiful
just like that.

56:48.719 --> 56:50.845
Yeah. Yeah. Oh! Oh!

56:53.056 --> 56:56.685
Oh, shit!

56:56.726 --> 56:57.686
Ohh!

56:57.727 --> 56:59.354
No, no, no.

56:59.396 --> 57:01.356
Don't fuck it up. Ohh.

57:01.564 --> 57:03.691
I've been thinking about
this whole friendship thing.

57:03.733 --> 57:05.402
I've never had a friend...

57:05.444 --> 57:06.694
who cared for me
the way you do.

57:06.736 --> 57:08.863
I mean, there's Ray...

57:08.905 --> 57:10.365
but he cares for me
in a different way...

57:10.406 --> 57:12.367
you know,
like bringing me flowers...

57:12.409 --> 57:13.701
and running my bath water.

57:13.743 --> 57:15.536
And there's nights
when I wake up screaming...

57:15.578 --> 57:18.081
and I look over,
and Ray's in my bed holding me.

57:19.708 --> 57:22.167
Anyway...

57:22.251 --> 57:24.671
seeing as how tonight may be
our last night together...

57:24.713 --> 57:25.963
I was thinking--

57:26.004 --> 57:28.507
That we should take our
friendship a little bit further.

57:28.549 --> 57:29.550
- Yes.
- Oh, Buddy!

57:29.592 --> 57:31.677
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

57:31.719 --> 57:35.138
This might be
our last night alive...

57:35.180 --> 57:37.182
and I want to take
full advantage of it.

57:37.224 --> 57:39.602
I was thinking the same thing!

57:39.644 --> 57:42.479
I want to be able to act out
our innermost fantasies.

57:42.521 --> 57:44.439
Oh, great.

57:44.481 --> 57:46.023
Like...

57:46.065 --> 57:49.360
I've always wanted
to walk on the moon.

57:49.402 --> 57:51.112
Huh?

57:57.786 --> 58:01.247
Buuuuudyyyy.

58:01.288 --> 58:02.957
Ha, ha, ha!

58:02.999 --> 58:05.084
What about you, Buddy?
What do you want to do?

58:06.127 --> 58:08.046
Well...

58:09.506 --> 58:10.965
He's in here.

58:11.006 --> 58:12.175
Oh!

58:19.348 --> 58:21.768
Aah! Aah! Aah!

58:29.274 --> 58:30.734
Oh, my God.
He locked us in.

58:30.776 --> 58:33.071
You should call for help.

58:33.113 --> 58:35.947
Hello! Hello.
Can you hear me?

58:36.949 --> 58:38.575
Come in! Come in!

58:38.617 --> 58:41.161
Copy! Do you copy me?

58:41.203 --> 58:43.706
We have a situation here!

58:43.747 --> 58:44.998
Breaker!

58:45.999 --> 58:47.626
Oh, my God.

58:47.667 --> 58:49.126
They can't hear me!

58:49.168 --> 58:51.797
Must be these walls
or something.

58:56.677 --> 58:59.930
OK. All right.

58:59.971 --> 59:02.599
You stay down here.
I'll go check upstairs.

59:02.641 --> 59:04.433
OK.

59:10.313 --> 59:12.275
Ow!

59:12.316 --> 59:13.442
Ah!

59:13.483 --> 59:15.445
- Do you need help or--
- No!

59:15.486 --> 59:16.742
OK.

59:16.779 --> 59:18.321
What do I look like to you?

59:18.363 --> 59:20.157
Just trying to be nice.

59:20.199 --> 59:21.200
Cover me!

59:21.242 --> 59:22.494
What do you want me to do?

59:22.536 --> 59:23.994
Cover me!

59:24.036 --> 59:27.665
Not literally.
I'm serpentining!

59:27.707 --> 59:29.208
They taught me that--

59:29.248 --> 59:32.086
Merchant marines.
Two years.

59:32.128 --> 59:34.963
Spent two years
on my belly in Danang.

59:35.005 --> 59:36.762
- Yeah.
- Look!

59:36.799 --> 59:39.134
Look. Look what
the cripple's doing.

59:39.175 --> 59:41.344
Oh, shit.

59:41.386 --> 59:43.388
Ow-ow-ow!

59:43.430 --> 59:45.641
Look, I know you're proud.
Just let me help you up--

59:45.683 --> 59:48.142
Step it back, candy pants!

59:48.183 --> 59:49.644
Fine.

59:52.355 --> 59:54.857
Oh, what are we gonna do?

59:54.899 --> 59:56.026
I'm cold.

59:56.067 --> 59:58.819
I can't feel my body,
I'm so cold.

59:58.861 --> 01:00:00.321
Buddy, can you feel this?

01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:01.323
No.

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:03.115
Try a little higher.

01:00:03.157 --> 01:00:04.993
What about that?

01:00:05.035 --> 01:00:05.994
Mm-mmm.

01:00:06.036 --> 01:00:09.747
Keep rubbing. Ohh.

01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:14.001
Oh, Buddy,
I don't think I'm re--

01:00:14.042 --> 01:00:17.504
Cindy, please!
It's a matter of life and death.

01:00:17.546 --> 01:00:20.006
I'm asking you...

01:00:20.048 --> 01:00:22.134
in the name of love.

01:00:25.679 --> 01:00:27.680
OK, Buddy.

01:00:27.722 --> 01:00:30.225
In the name of love.

01:00:30.267 --> 01:00:32.561
Ohh.

01:00:34.479 --> 01:00:37.648
Mmm. Ohh.

01:00:37.690 --> 01:00:39.485
Oh, Cindy...

01:00:39.527 --> 01:00:42.319
I don't know how much longer
I can hold on.

01:00:42.361 --> 01:00:44.239
Don't you say
your good-byes.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.699
You're gonna
get out of here...

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:47.575
and you're gonna go on...

01:00:47.617 --> 01:00:50.036
and you're gonna
have lots of little babies.

01:00:50.078 --> 01:00:51.954
And you're gonna
die an old man...

01:00:51.996 --> 01:00:52.955
Old man.

01:00:52.997 --> 01:00:54.792
Warm in his bed.

01:00:54.833 --> 01:00:56.293
- Not here!
- No.

01:00:56.334 --> 01:00:58.461
- Not like this!
- Amen.

01:00:58.502 --> 01:01:00.672
- Do you understand me?
- Oh, yeah.

01:01:00.714 --> 01:01:02.799
Coming to this house
was the best thing...

01:01:02.882 --> 01:01:04.384
that ever happened to me.

01:01:04.425 --> 01:01:05.426
Oh, me, too.

01:01:05.467 --> 01:01:08.763
And for that...
I am so thankful.

01:01:08.804 --> 01:01:09.764
Oh, don't let go.

01:01:09.805 --> 01:01:11.598
Never!
I'll never let go!

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.558
- I feel weak.
- Buddy!

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.894
- I'm com--
- Come back!

01:01:14.936 --> 01:01:15.978
Aah!

01:01:18.189 --> 01:01:19.982
All right, Dwight Hartman...

01:01:20.024 --> 01:01:23.193
it's your time to shine.

01:01:23.235 --> 01:01:25.237
All right. Come on.

01:01:31.534 --> 01:01:33.913
Come on, Kane.

01:01:33.954 --> 01:01:35.789
Show yourself!

01:01:35.831 --> 01:01:37.374
Look. I don't even need
my thermal goggles.

01:01:41.962 --> 01:01:43.087
Aah!

01:01:44.882 --> 01:01:45.882
Ha, ha, ha!

01:01:47.425 --> 01:01:48.551
Oh!

01:01:48.594 --> 01:01:50.345
Aah!

01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:53.807
Ah. Ah.

01:01:58.936 --> 01:02:00.813
Ow!

01:02:04.567 --> 01:02:07.736
That's right, mother--

01:02:07.778 --> 01:02:08.988
Ha, ha, ha!

01:02:09.030 --> 01:02:09.989
Whoa!

01:02:10.031 --> 01:02:11.699
Ow-ow-ow!

01:02:11.741 --> 01:02:12.784
Ha, ha, ha!

01:02:12.825 --> 01:02:14.994
Aah!

01:02:15.035 --> 01:02:16.454
Hey, Kane, you hungry?

01:02:16.494 --> 01:02:18.580
How about
a little snack of this?

01:02:18.622 --> 01:02:20.041
Ha ha!

01:02:20.083 --> 01:02:22.042
Aah!

01:02:22.084 --> 01:02:25.253
Ow. Ow. No. Ow.

01:02:25.295 --> 01:02:27.048
Ow-ow-ow.

01:02:33.011 --> 01:02:34.388
Gotcha!

01:02:40.392 --> 01:02:44.481
Aaargh!

01:02:46.816 --> 01:02:48.151
I know what you're thinking.

01:02:48.193 --> 01:02:52.113
Did I fire 3 shots or 117?

01:02:52.155 --> 01:02:55.657
Well, do you feel lucky...

01:02:55.699 --> 01:02:57.159
punk?

01:02:57.201 --> 01:03:00.328
Do you... feel lucky?

01:03:00.370 --> 01:03:01.831
Do you feel lucky, punk?

01:03:01.873 --> 01:03:03.082
Shoot me, motherfucker!

01:03:09.588 --> 01:03:11.799
OK. Fine.

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.093
Make your best move, ass bite.

01:03:30.275 --> 01:03:33.028
- Raaa!
- Aaah!

01:03:35.863 --> 01:03:38.658
Oh. Whayaaa!

01:03:38.700 --> 01:03:40.159
Whoa!

01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:41.452
Whoo!

01:03:43.371 --> 01:03:44.580
Aah!

01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:56.425
Uh.

01:03:56.467 --> 01:03:58.135
Help!

01:03:59.428 --> 01:04:00.387
Help!

01:04:00.429 --> 01:04:03.098
Here. Take my hand.

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.558
Ahh!

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:06.101
Come on.

01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:08.354
You're gonna fall
unless you take my hand...

01:04:08.396 --> 01:04:09.687
No. Give me
your other hand.

01:04:09.729 --> 01:04:12.608
No. My other hand
isn't strong enough.

01:04:12.649 --> 01:04:13.858
You take my little hand.

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:15.694
No! Get it away from me!

01:04:15.736 --> 01:04:18.363
Take it! Take my hand!

01:04:18.404 --> 01:04:22.033
Aah!

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.245
Eww.

01:04:29.165 --> 01:04:30.124
No.

01:04:30.167 --> 01:04:31.126
No. Why me?

01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:32.585
No. Come on. No.

01:04:32.627 --> 01:04:35.130
I've served you well.
Don't you do this to me.

01:04:35.172 --> 01:04:37.132
No, please. Please, no.

01:04:37.174 --> 01:04:40.135
Ple-ple-ple--Aah!

01:04:40.593 --> 01:04:42.179
OK, Buddy.

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:44.972
It's time for us
to get out of here.

01:05:17.338 --> 01:05:19.339
Roger. Roger.
Come in, Roger.

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:20.549
Ray, this is Cindy.

01:05:20.591 --> 01:05:21.634
I don't want
to talk to Cindy.

01:05:21.676 --> 01:05:22.800
I want to talk to Roger.

01:05:22.842 --> 01:05:24.803
Roger, where you at, man?
Quit fucking around.

01:05:24.887 --> 01:05:26.597
Ray, listen.
The ghost is close.

01:05:26.638 --> 01:05:28.307
He almost got us.
Buddy's hurt.

01:05:28.348 --> 01:05:30.725
- What's your location?
- I'm right behind you.

01:05:30.767 --> 01:05:33.019
Ray, thank God.
OK. Where's Shorty?

01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:35.020
I don't--I don't know.

01:05:35.062 --> 01:05:36.486
He was here
just a minute ago.

01:05:36.523 --> 01:05:38.607
Listen,
you go help Buddy in the lab.

01:05:38.649 --> 01:05:41.319
- I'll go check upstairs.
- All right.

01:05:42.402 --> 01:05:45.698
Mmm. That smells good.

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:46.824
Hello, Cindy.

01:05:46.866 --> 01:05:50.119
Say heloo to Cindy, Shorty.

01:05:50.161 --> 01:05:53.997
Heloo... Cindy.

01:05:54.039 --> 01:05:54.999
Shorty, are you OK?

01:05:55.041 --> 01:05:56.709
Talk to me!

01:05:56.751 --> 01:06:00.046
Morphine? Chloroform?

01:06:00.087 --> 01:06:01.713
Horse tranquilizers?
You drugged him!

01:06:01.755 --> 01:06:04.341
I did not.
That's all his stuff.

01:06:04.383 --> 01:06:05.384
Yaah!

01:06:05.426 --> 01:06:07.010
All right, Shorty.

01:06:07.052 --> 01:06:08.679
Who's ready
for the main course?

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.306
Me! Me.

01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:12.181
Oh, Hanson, please.

01:06:12.223 --> 01:06:14.601
No. Oh.

01:06:16.228 --> 01:06:17.270
What the fuck?

01:06:17.311 --> 01:06:18.897
Beetlejuice in the house.

01:06:18.939 --> 01:06:22.233
This is your brains
on drugs. Hee!

01:06:22.275 --> 01:06:24.152
Oof.

01:06:24.193 --> 01:06:25.571
Oh, shit, son.

01:06:25.613 --> 01:06:28.739
Aah!

01:06:28.781 --> 01:06:30.867
Oh.

01:06:34.036 --> 01:06:35.455
Shorty!

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:36.872
Got me.

01:06:36.914 --> 01:06:38.875
Cindy, what's going on?

01:06:38.917 --> 01:06:40.877
It's Hanson.
He's possessed.

01:06:40.914 --> 01:06:42.002
Let's get him.

01:07:18.246 --> 01:07:20.623
Whoo!

01:07:20.665 --> 01:07:22.208
Ahh.

01:07:22.249 --> 01:07:23.377
Angel style!

01:07:25.753 --> 01:07:28.548
Hi-yah!

01:07:28.590 --> 01:07:29.799
Aah!

01:07:29.841 --> 01:07:32.385
Smack my bitch up

01:07:32.426 --> 01:07:33.636
Aah!

01:07:37.682 --> 01:07:38.892
Uh!

01:07:48.108 --> 01:07:51.237
Whoo! OK.

01:07:51.278 --> 01:07:53.572
Boo!

01:07:53.614 --> 01:07:54.616
Come on.

01:07:54.658 --> 01:07:55.990
Aah!

01:07:56.032 --> 01:07:56.991
- Oh!
- Aah!

01:07:57.033 --> 01:07:58.410
Smack my bitch up

01:07:58.452 --> 01:07:59.911
Aah!

01:08:11.339 --> 01:08:13.216
OK.

01:08:15.468 --> 01:08:16.426
Aaaaaaah...

01:08:16.469 --> 01:08:18.555
Oh, nooo!

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:20.305
Oh!

01:08:20.346 --> 01:08:22.517
Ohh.

01:08:22.558 --> 01:08:24.935
Hee, hee, hee! Ooh!

01:08:24.971 --> 01:08:26.479
Aah!

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:33.861
Hi-yi!

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:37.031
Aah!

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.765
Aah!

01:08:41.801 --> 01:08:43.495
Whoo!

01:08:46.332 --> 01:08:48.792
Whoo! Oh! Ooh!

01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:02.514
Ooh!

01:09:25.327 --> 01:09:26.412
Ow.

01:09:26.455 --> 01:09:27.413
Shit.

01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:34.920
Ahh!

01:09:34.962 --> 01:09:36.964
You OK, Dwight?

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:40.050
I--I can't feel my legs.

01:09:41.676 --> 01:09:45.139
Aah!
I can't feel my legs!

01:09:45.179 --> 01:09:46.515
You never could.

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:47.975
You stay out of this,
all right?

01:09:48.015 --> 01:09:49.434
Now listen.

01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:51.270
You get the others
and meet us upstairs.

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:52.270
- All right?
- OK.

01:09:52.312 --> 01:09:53.479
You stay here.

01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:56.274
Ray-Ray, I need your help.
Give me your belt.

01:09:56.316 --> 01:09:57.318
- Hi-yah!
- Hah!

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.693
Heee!

01:09:58.735 --> 01:10:00.695
Hmmm. The crane.

01:10:03.155 --> 01:10:04.324
Ha!

01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:07.785
The crouching tiger.

01:10:12.832 --> 01:10:14.584
The drunken monkey.

01:10:14.626 --> 01:10:16.879
Ooh, ooh, ooh
ah, ah, ah!

01:10:18.462 --> 01:10:19.630
The mad cow.

01:10:22.342 --> 01:10:25.761
Motherfucker! Moo!

01:10:25.803 --> 01:10:27.263
Aah!

01:10:27.305 --> 01:10:28.890
The camel toe.

01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:32.268
Yow-hi!

01:10:51.538 --> 01:10:53.455
Get the hell
out of there, guys!

01:10:53.497 --> 01:10:54.580
Come on!

01:11:00.504 --> 01:11:02.714
Ray, give me a 180.

01:11:02.756 --> 01:11:04.716
OK. Listen.
Someone has to go...

01:11:04.758 --> 01:11:07.343
and lure him
onto that platform.

01:11:11.306 --> 01:11:13.683
All right. I'll go.

01:11:13.724 --> 01:11:14.685
Cindy, let me--

01:11:14.726 --> 01:11:16.353
No, Buddy!

01:11:16.395 --> 01:11:17.769
I'm the one he wants.

01:11:17.811 --> 01:11:19.522
Actually, I was saying...

01:11:19.564 --> 01:11:21.565
let me have your computer
if you die.

01:11:21.606 --> 01:11:23.693
Oh.

01:11:23.735 --> 01:11:24.944
OK. But as soon as
he gets there...

01:11:24.986 --> 01:11:26.321
you have to get off.

01:11:26.363 --> 01:11:27.988
OK.

01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:29.281
All right. 180 me.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:33.285
Hugh Kane, it's me you want!

01:11:33.327 --> 01:11:34.787
Come get me!

01:11:34.829 --> 01:11:37.331
I'm not afraid anymore!

01:11:37.372 --> 01:11:39.041
Show yourself!

01:11:41.919 --> 01:11:43.587
Aah! Oh!

01:11:47.382 --> 01:11:49.009
Aah!

01:11:50.886 --> 01:11:52.386
Ooh.

01:12:00.354 --> 01:12:01.692
Dwight, he's here.
Do something.

01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:03.272
I can't.
She's still on the platform.

01:12:03.314 --> 01:12:04.859
If I throw the switch,
she'll die.

01:12:04.899 --> 01:12:06.275
Cindy, get out of there!
You'll get killed!

01:12:06.317 --> 01:12:07.819
Aah!

01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:09.154
Ha, ha, ha!

01:12:09.196 --> 01:12:10.280
Move out of the way!

01:12:10.321 --> 01:12:11.823
I'll get her!

01:12:14.492 --> 01:12:15.701
Why is he running so slow?

01:12:15.743 --> 01:12:17.870
Ray! Run faster!

01:12:17.912 --> 01:12:18.877
OK!

01:12:18.912 --> 01:12:21.540
Throw the switch!

01:12:21.582 --> 01:12:23.626
Now you will be mine...
forever!

01:12:35.762 --> 01:12:38.265
Ray, you saved me.

01:12:38.302 --> 01:12:39.559
Are you OK?

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.563
I'm fine.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:42.227
I broke my fall.

01:12:42.268 --> 01:12:44.729
Ohh. Ah.

01:12:58.118 --> 01:12:59.869
Oh.

01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:02.372
- Yes!
- Yes!

01:13:04.374 --> 01:13:07.085
Hey, y'all.
What's going on?

01:13:07.126 --> 01:13:09.629
Shorty, you made it.
You're alive!

01:13:14.426 --> 01:13:17.052
Yeah.
It was traumatic.

01:13:17.094 --> 01:13:18.763
It really was...

01:13:18.805 --> 01:13:21.056
and it's taking me
a while to get over it,

01:13:21.099 --> 01:13:22.558
but, you know...

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.020
now that we're out of the house
and back in school...

01:13:26.061 --> 01:13:28.189
I just know that
everything's gonna be OK.

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:31.733
Oh, God,
will you shut the fuck up?

01:13:31.817 --> 01:13:34.236
Why couldn't you have
just left me there to die?

01:13:34.278 --> 01:13:36.363
Give me a fucking rope.
I'll hang myself.

01:13:36.404 --> 01:13:38.699
Here I go.
I'm hanging myself.

01:13:41.576 --> 01:13:42.953
Hello?

01:13:42.995 --> 01:13:44.918
Oh, hi, Dad.

01:13:44.955 --> 01:13:47.582
Are you having fun
on your vacation?

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:49.876
Oh, no. Birds are
very clean animals.

01:13:49.917 --> 01:13:51.086
He's no trouble at all.

01:13:51.127 --> 01:13:52.170
Goddamn it!

01:13:52.212 --> 01:13:54.380
What the fuck
did you put in this birdseed?

01:13:59.802 --> 01:14:01.762
Oh, Dad, Buddy's here.
I got to go.

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:02.847
OK. I love you. Bye.

01:14:02.889 --> 01:14:05.182
God, that was a big one.

01:14:05.224 --> 01:14:07.769
- Hey, Buddy!
- Surprise.

01:14:07.811 --> 01:14:09.102
Open chest!

01:14:09.144 --> 01:14:13.107
Oh! You got to be quicker
than that, pencil dick.

01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:14.774
Come on.

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:18.112
Hey, look out. A bee.

01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:19.572
Buddy,
I've never had anyone...

01:14:19.614 --> 01:14:21.949
be so protective
of me before.

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:23.451
That's what your man's
supposed to do.

01:14:23.492 --> 01:14:25.536
Two hot dogs.

01:14:30.582 --> 01:14:31.750
Buddy, get him!

01:14:31.792 --> 01:14:34.252
Buddy? Buddy?

01:14:34.294 --> 01:14:35.796
I've come back for you.

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:37.464
No! This can't be happening!

01:14:37.506 --> 01:14:40.133
Mm-hmm.
It is happening.

01:14:40.175 --> 01:14:43.095
Now we're gonna be
together forever.

01:14:43.137 --> 01:14:45.096
Nooooo!

01:14:45.512 --> 01:14:51.145
Yes!

01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:55.273
Did you hear something?

01:14:55.315 --> 01:14:58.777
No. I didn't hear nothing.
