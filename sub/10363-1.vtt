WEBVTT

00:12.160 --> 00:14.840
[man]
I believe in Norway.

00:14.920 --> 00:19.440
I always said
it's the best country in the world.

00:19.520 --> 00:25.240
But those damn politicians have set up
a refugee camp

00:25.320 --> 00:28.600
close to my house.

00:28.680 --> 00:32.160
That was three months ago,

00:32.240 --> 00:35.200
and I haven't slept since.

00:37.520 --> 00:40.200
The other afternoon, I went over to them

00:40.280 --> 00:43.000
to tell them a thing or two.

00:43.080 --> 00:46.760
I brought the dog.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.400
I was polite and all,

00:48.480 --> 00:51.680
but they refused to turn down the music.

00:53.640 --> 00:57.320
Now, Hector...

00:57.400 --> 01:01.240
Hector's really sensitive, yeah.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.800
[in Norwegian]
He started--

01:02.880 --> 01:06.040
[in English]
He started barking,

01:06.120 --> 01:10.720
and that was when all of them kicked him.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.640
Broke his jaw.

01:14.040 --> 01:16.080
[coughs]

01:16.160 --> 01:20.560
I told the police,
but they don't do nothing.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.160
[sniffles, coughs]

01:28.920 --> 01:31.240
Why did you go to the police?

01:31.320 --> 01:33.800
Why didn't you come to me first?

01:33.880 --> 01:36.000
I know, I know that I...

01:36.080 --> 01:39.800
But, uh, that was before.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.480
Before what?

01:41.560 --> 01:46.320
Before I knew what kind of man you are.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.800
Good.

01:56.920 --> 02:01.360
Someday,
and that day may never come,

02:01.440 --> 02:04.360
I will call upon you to shovel some snow.

02:04.440 --> 02:07.000
But until that day comes,

02:07.080 --> 02:08.920
accept this as a gift

02:09.000 --> 02:12.520
on the weekend my kids are baptized.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.520
We will look into your problem.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.800
Thank you. Thank you.

02:18.040 --> 02:19.040
[Hector barks]

02:24.000 --> 02:26.080
What a putz.

02:26.160 --> 02:29.120
[theme song playing]

03:02.240 --> 03:05.040
[upbeat music playing]

03:05.120 --> 03:07.160
Hey, girls,
how's the crowd out there?

03:07.240 --> 03:08.440
- Amazing.
- Yeah?

03:08.520 --> 03:10.640
Hey, baby, how are you?

03:10.720 --> 03:13.480
Hey, look, everybody's here.

03:13.560 --> 03:17.120
Hey, look at you, you're beautiful.

03:17.200 --> 03:21.120
Hey, baby. What a fucking freak.
Hey. Hey, hey, how are you?

03:21.200 --> 03:25.280
[speaking in Norwegian] We are gonna go
together to buy a gift for the baptism.

03:25.360 --> 03:28.080
- You want in, brother?
- No.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.280
I'm knitting a gift myself.

03:30.360 --> 03:31.800
[men laughing]

03:31.880 --> 03:34.240
Isn't that a bit ladylike?

03:34.320 --> 03:36.520
Plenty of guys are into that now.

03:37.960 --> 03:39.000
Who?

03:39.080 --> 03:41.000
Ever heard of Arne and Carlos?

03:41.080 --> 03:44.880
I think it's cute that you are knitting,
Auntie Torgeir.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.080
Auntie Torgeir?

03:49.200 --> 03:51.520
You're so cute!

03:51.600 --> 03:54.480
I am just kidding with you.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.760
- Cheers!
- [all] Cheers!

04:04.160 --> 04:07.160
[rock music playing on radio]

04:07.240 --> 04:10.720
[in English accent] One of the Scandis
told me something funny yesterday.

04:10.800 --> 04:14.760
Why is it that all British birds are
so fucking ugly?

04:18.000 --> 04:21.600
Because the Vikings raped and kidnapped
all the pretty ones.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.320
[laughs]

04:25.120 --> 04:27.080
For fuck's sake, lighten up, will you?

04:27.160 --> 04:29.320
I said I'm sorry, didn't I?

04:29.400 --> 04:32.560
Do you want to stop for a fuck?
Cheer you up.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.600
Right-lane fucking driving.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.400
It's not natural.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.280
[female voice on GPS]
You are now approaching Lillehammer.

04:54.080 --> 04:57.320
So tell me, godfather.
Are we all set for tomorrow?

04:57.400 --> 05:00.080
You bet your ass.
And you know what?

05:00.160 --> 05:02.960
We are-- We are gonna sit
on the front row,

05:03.040 --> 05:05.760
because I bribed the church boss,

05:05.840 --> 05:07.320
so we get front row.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.560
- Ringside?
- Yeah.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.200
- I love it.
- Yeah.

05:10.280 --> 05:14.120
And one more thing.
I made this.

05:14.200 --> 05:17.360
Oh. What's this?

05:17.440 --> 05:21.400
"Asbjørn and Asbjørg."

05:21.480 --> 05:24.800
It's the name of your babies.
Asbjørn and Asbjørg.

05:24.880 --> 05:27.600
What?

05:27.680 --> 05:29.480
Didn't Sigrid tell you about the names?

05:29.560 --> 05:32.000
My kids are not gonna be known
as the ass-twins.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.240
You should have straightened this out.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.840
[in Norwegian] Uh, I didn't know
that it was the godfather's task to--

05:37.920 --> 05:41.160
[cell phone rings]

05:41.240 --> 05:43.520
[in English]
I got to take this, boss.

05:43.600 --> 05:45.400
[in Norwegian]
This is Torgeir.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.160
"Assburn"?

05:47.240 --> 05:49.640
[hip-hop playing over headphones]

05:56.560 --> 05:59.120
Fucking hobos.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.640
Got no respect for nothing.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.360
[man grunts]

06:08.640 --> 06:10.440
Aah!

06:10.520 --> 06:11.800
[grunts]

06:11.880 --> 06:16.240
And stay out, you fucking bum.

06:16.320 --> 06:17.720
- Boss? What--?
- What?

06:17.800 --> 06:19.400
What are you doing with the priest?

06:19.480 --> 06:20.920
What am I doing with what?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.880
He's the-- He's a priest.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.720
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.680
I thought you were just another
homeless jerk-off stealing from God.

06:28.760 --> 06:30.760
[in Norwegian] Would you like to go
inside and sit down?

06:30.840 --> 06:32.360
You okay?

06:32.440 --> 06:33.920
[in Norwegian] How are you doing?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.600
[priest] Uh... It's okay.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.840
[in English]
He looked a bit dizzy, didn't he?

06:40.920 --> 06:42.840
Ah, he'll be all right.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.000
[in Norwegian]
How does it look in relation to...?

06:45.080 --> 06:47.440
You need to put it
a little more to the left.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.520
- Yes, there.
- A bit further down.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.960
Oh, shit, here comes.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.960
- You Dag?
- [in English] Yeah.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.680
Duncan.
We spoke on the phone.

07:00.880 --> 07:02.360
Wow.

07:03.360 --> 07:06.120
It's even cooler than the picture
on the Internet.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.840
Yes, mate.
Gorgeous, isn't it?

07:07.920 --> 07:09.120
Yeah.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.000
- So?
- Yeah.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.160
Well, I have a client who's been looking

07:13.240 --> 07:15.840
for exactly this type of car.

07:15.920 --> 07:18.400
And I made myself clear
about no paperwork.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no paperwork.
The customer--

07:21.240 --> 07:24.840
Well, the potential customer
also prefers cash payment.

07:24.920 --> 07:27.040
That's music to my ears, mate.

07:28.280 --> 07:29.800
Yeah. Hi, there.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.520
Are you enjoying Norway so far?

07:31.600 --> 07:33.200
[in English accent]
Oh, yeah.

07:33.280 --> 07:35.920
It's as wonderful
as my first dose of chlamydia.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.960
[chuckles]

07:52.880 --> 07:54.760
[in Norwegian]
Is this the refugee center?

07:54.840 --> 07:57.440
[man in Norwegian] Great location.
Nice and quiet here.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.200
[Johnny in English]
That's our guy right there.

08:01.280 --> 08:05.480
[trance music blaring]

08:05.560 --> 08:09.560
Whoa. Where are
these refugees from, Ibiza?

08:12.160 --> 08:15.520
[in Norwegian]
Hey, you need to turn down the music.

08:21.120 --> 08:23.040
[in Norwegian]
Randi?

08:23.120 --> 08:24.640
Hello, Jan.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.280
So nice.
It has been a while.

08:28.360 --> 08:31.560
I'm this close to reporting
your refugee center to the UDI.

08:31.640 --> 08:35.600
Report my refugee center?

08:35.680 --> 08:38.440
Do you realize that one
of the residents here

08:38.520 --> 08:40.680
attacked the neighbor's dog?

08:40.760 --> 08:42.920
That's awful.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.840
[trance music blaring]

08:57.600 --> 08:59.680
Daddy's home.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.640
Did you miss me?

09:01.720 --> 09:03.800
What's the matter?
You can't hear me?

09:05.200 --> 09:07.080
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- [static crackles]

09:11.040 --> 09:13.320
What the fuck?

09:13.400 --> 09:15.560
Rules to live by.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.400
Always do exactly as you're told

09:18.480 --> 09:21.400
by the crazy fuck
with a gun in your face.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.120
Oh, and, uh,

09:24.200 --> 09:28.160
the Lillehammer Canine Society says hello.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.040
Oh! Uhh.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.600
[chuckles]

09:32.680 --> 09:34.680
[in Norwegian]
What has happened to you?

09:35.560 --> 09:38.000
You used to have one of the tidiest desks
in public management.

09:38.080 --> 09:42.320
The transition to the private sector
has been a bit rough.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.160
Now the puzzle falls into place.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.440
Oh, yes?

09:52.880 --> 09:54.800
[in English]
African Salad.

09:56.640 --> 10:00.240
[in Norwegian] I had a summer job
with the UNHCR in Somalia in 2002.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.720
This is not the first time
I've seen a khat plant, Randi.

10:02.800 --> 10:04.960
Jan, I just got a small bundle
off one of the Somalis

10:05.040 --> 10:06.960
to handle the work pressure.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.760
But it's under control.
I can stop tomorrow.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.920
I'm afraid I'll have to inform
the authorities.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.120
Jan, I can quit tomorrow.
I have total control.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.040
I cannot ignore this, Randi.
I have to report it.

10:17.120 --> 10:19.240
- Jan...
- This just won't do.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.240
You remember what happened

10:21.320 --> 10:23.760
in the office supply room that night

10:23.840 --> 10:26.600
after the Desmond Tutu conference?

10:26.680 --> 10:28.040
Yes.

10:28.120 --> 10:30.480
- Hm? You remember it?
- Ahh.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.880
Where you been?

10:41.960 --> 10:44.800
[in English] The manager needed
some professional input.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.320
Uh-huh.

10:46.400 --> 10:49.040
Hey, what gives with all those
major appliances?

10:49.120 --> 10:51.200
[in Norwegian]
Probably donations.

10:51.280 --> 10:54.800
Yeah. You know,
I thought this refugee stuff

10:54.880 --> 10:56.280
was all do-gooders,

10:56.360 --> 10:59.120
but, uh, there's some
business opportunities here.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.320
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.000
[in Norwegian] Oh, there's a lot of money
in integration.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.720
Look into it.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.800
See if we can get in
on some of that action.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.640
[bell tolling]

11:26.600 --> 11:28.640
Aw, look at you.

11:28.720 --> 11:31.000
Look at these guys, huh?

11:31.080 --> 11:33.440
What's going on?

11:33.520 --> 11:35.400
[in Norwegian]
The baptism has been canceled.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.880
What?

11:36.960 --> 11:38.880
[in English]
I think the priest, he got some--

11:39.120 --> 11:40.720
[in Norwegian]
A concussion or something.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.000
[in Norwegian]
Ah, probably because you hit his head--

11:43.080 --> 11:45.840
Oh, that skateboarding,
that's dangerous.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.080
[in English] Well, it's so cold.

11:47.160 --> 11:49.040
[in Norwegian]
I must get the kids in the car.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.760
Don't worry, huh?
I will get another date.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.520
- Sure?
- I promise.

11:52.600 --> 11:53.920
Okay. Come on.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.040
[in Norwegian]
Did you put her in her seat?

11:56.120 --> 11:57.880
Bye-bye.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.280
You know,

12:02.360 --> 12:04.720
could be a blessing in disguise.

12:04.800 --> 12:10.080
Gives us a chance to sort out that whole,
uh, ass name situation.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.040
Good thinking, boss.

12:12.120 --> 12:15.160
- Yeah, you know.
- Good think--

12:23.160 --> 12:24.840
[in Norwegian] Shit, I had been waiting
for the buffet all day,

12:24.920 --> 12:26.880
but the whole thing got canceled.

12:26.960 --> 12:30.400
I'm completely starved.
Oh, put on some more.

12:30.480 --> 12:31.720
Like that?

12:31.800 --> 12:33.480
Okay.

12:33.560 --> 12:35.960
- That'll be 45 krone.
- And I'll have a soda.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.600
- Okay, then it'll be 60 krone.
- I'm not paying.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.520
You forgot to ask if I wanted
a drink with my meal.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.320
That's just Statoil.

12:42.400 --> 12:44.120
No, that applies everywhere.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.560
If you don't ask the customer
if he wants a beverage, it's free.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.640
That's just the way it is, sweetheart.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.560
Goddamn!

13:00.640 --> 13:02.400
[in Norwegian]
Cool, isn't it?

13:02.480 --> 13:05.320
It's beyond cool.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.000
Did you buy it?

13:07.080 --> 13:11.080
Just test driving a bit.

13:11.160 --> 13:13.360
Thinking about buying it.
We'll see.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.720
- Come on, get in.
- Let's go, goddamn it.

13:21.720 --> 13:24.120
[engine revs]

13:24.200 --> 13:27.440
[tires squeal]

13:27.520 --> 13:30.520
[Turbonegro's "Good Head" playing]

13:42.920 --> 13:45.440
- Check out that sound. Check it.
- [guns engine]

13:45.520 --> 13:47.800
You can feel the vibrations
go up your ass.

13:50.320 --> 13:54.200
Not too much.
It needs to be full when I return it.

13:54.280 --> 13:57.840
- Who gives a shit?
- No, but seriously.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.560
Look at you, soon to be
the godfather of two children!

14:01.360 --> 14:03.840
Yeah, that's nice and all.

14:04.640 --> 14:09.960
But there's one thing
that's been bugging me.

14:10.040 --> 14:12.200
You know Johnny belongs
to another religion.

14:12.280 --> 14:15.360
- Catholicism?
- Yeah.

14:15.440 --> 14:18.800
So I was wondering if you know
what the godfather's role is

14:18.880 --> 14:20.560
in the whole deal with Mr. Johnson?

14:20.640 --> 14:24.280
Am I supposed
to hold the knife or something

14:24.360 --> 14:28.200
when they do the circumcision?

14:28.280 --> 14:29.880
Catholics don't do that.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.480
- You sure?
- One hundred percent.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.440
[in English]
Stop, stop, stop.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.720
[in Norwegian]
So, where are we now, boys?

14:40.400 --> 14:42.200
- The Vingnes Bridge.
- [engine revs]

14:44.760 --> 14:46.240
Give me your phone.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.400
No, no, no.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.520
Torgeir, listen, we are in a Ferrari
at the Vingnes Bridge.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.040
Don't be a pussy now.
Come on.

14:54.120 --> 14:56.160
No, it is me who is responsible
for this Ferrari.

14:56.240 --> 14:59.320
[in English]
Okay, car freaks all over the world,

14:59.400 --> 15:01.360
we're now gonna set the speed record

15:01.440 --> 15:04.840
on the Vingnes Bridge
in Lillehammer, Norway.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.960
Be prepared, motherfuckers.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.120
[engine revving]

15:17.480 --> 15:19.080
[in Norwegian]
I feel it tugging at my balls.

15:19.160 --> 15:20.960
[in English]
One hundred eighteen.

15:21.040 --> 15:24.040
[in Norwegian] It's really tugging.
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.920
- Still filming?
- Yes, yes.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.600
And I feel it. I feel it.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.120
- Whoa!
- [cell phone rings]

15:30.200 --> 15:32.000
It is the car dealer.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.800
- I must answer it, it is my phone.
- Stop it!

15:34.880 --> 15:37.560
- Stop it. I'm filming!
- Don't be such a child.

15:38.880 --> 15:39.880
[downshifts]

15:39.960 --> 15:41.560
- Oh!
- [tires screech]

15:48.480 --> 15:49.600
[cell phone rings]

15:49.680 --> 15:51.200
[elk grunts]

15:53.160 --> 15:54.160
[man in English]
Yes.

15:54.240 --> 15:56.640
[in Norwegian]
The first exercise today

15:56.720 --> 16:00.360
is inspired by something I picked up
when I worked as a pearl diver

16:00.440 --> 16:02.520
off the coast of the Aeolian Islands.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.000
Let's pair up two and two.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.160
Sigrid, maybe you'll do it with me?

16:07.240 --> 16:08.440
Yeah.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.560
So you go to the teacher.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.560
And you stay here with Mommy.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.480
Whee.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.360
[laughs]

16:17.960 --> 16:20.840
Do you exercise a lot or something?

16:20.920 --> 16:22.560
No. How so?

16:22.640 --> 16:24.640
You look almost too good

16:24.720 --> 16:27.040
for a woman who's just had twins.

16:27.120 --> 16:30.400
I'm probably just... naturally skinny.

16:30.480 --> 16:32.800
Naturally smashing is more like it.

16:38.200 --> 16:40.480
I can take the children if you
need to talk to your husband.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.160
Eh, that's my ex, actually.
We are not together anymore.

16:46.880 --> 16:49.520
So, how are my future
Olympic swimmers doing?

16:49.600 --> 16:51.720
They kicking
the other kids' asses or what?

16:51.800 --> 16:53.120
[in Norwegian]
It's not a competition.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.000
[in English]
They don't get any scores.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.600
Looks like David Hasselhoff
over there is trying to score.

17:00.640 --> 17:04.800
I stopped by to discuss
the baby name crisis.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.840
What name crisis?

17:06.920 --> 17:09.640
Well, uh, I'm sure
you weren't aware of it,

17:09.720 --> 17:12.360
but in my language

17:12.440 --> 17:16.720
the "ass" prefix
has an unfortunate connotation.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.360
[in Norwegian] I think you should focus
on getting the kids baptized.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.680
All the moms have got new dates except us.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.160
[in English]
Maybe the priest doesn't like us.

17:25.240 --> 17:28.480
Come on.
Everybody loves Johnny.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.280
Listen, don't worry
about a thing, all right?

17:32.360 --> 17:35.360
You take care
of our future gold medalists,

17:35.440 --> 17:38.360
and we'll fight round two
of the baby name game later.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.800
Padre, you got a minute?

17:54.880 --> 17:56.760
[in Norwegian]
Boys, give me two minutes.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.280
I'll be back.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.600
Yeah?

18:02.680 --> 18:04.400
Good to see you're feeling better.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.960
[in Norwegian] Yes, I am fine.

18:06.040 --> 18:08.880
I hear there's been some difficulty
rescheduling the date of baptism.

18:08.960 --> 18:09.960
What's that about?

18:10.040 --> 18:12.640
You still holding a grudge
about what happened outside the church?

18:12.720 --> 18:14.200
That's cool.

18:14.280 --> 18:17.440
What's not cool is the life you're leading
down at your club.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.440
- I don't follow you, Father.
- [in English] Oh, come on.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.920
You're a bad influence in this city.

18:23.000 --> 18:26.840
[in Norwegian] Our church warden found one
of your guests in the street last weekend.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.640
[in English]
Lying naked, drunk, with a... tampon,

18:30.720 --> 18:33.080
with, uh, alcohol in his anal.

18:33.160 --> 18:37.120
I can assure you,
I had no part in that scenario.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.920
[in Norwegian]
Come on.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.080
Look, I can see you
having a beef with me,

18:42.160 --> 18:45.200
but it's not very Christian
taking it out on the kids.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.640
Okay, I will baptize those kids of yours
on one condition.

18:48.720 --> 18:50.560
That I can baptize you at the same time.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.840
What?

18:52.920 --> 18:55.200
I ain't bowing my head to no God

18:55.280 --> 18:58.320
that hangs out with a hip-hop hippie
trying to be with it.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.680
Yeah.

18:59.760 --> 19:03.200
- My God is a proud Catholic God.
- Oh.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.880
And he looks down on skateboards
and gay headwear.

19:05.960 --> 19:08.160
[in Norwegian]
Then you must excuse me,

19:08.240 --> 19:09.760
because now I am going skating
with the kids.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.840
[in English]
Have a nice day.

19:28.480 --> 19:31.440
[in Norwegian] This is going to be fine.
I've put together worse things than this.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.360
This works out fine.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.120
Yes. I will put in a new window

19:35.200 --> 19:38.000
and spray on some paint,
and it will be like new.

19:38.080 --> 19:40.400
Are you sure it is wise

19:40.480 --> 19:42.600
to just go ahead on your own like this?

19:42.680 --> 19:45.760
You would rather call
the insurance company?

19:45.840 --> 19:47.880
And say that we went crashing into an elk

19:47.960 --> 19:50.640
while we were trying to break the record?

19:52.640 --> 19:57.520
Just promise me that you will fix it.

19:57.600 --> 20:00.600
Don't worry.
Uncle Roy will fix it.

20:02.600 --> 20:05.320
Roy doesn't like to be disturbed
when he's working.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.040
But he'll be ready soon.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.120
It will be okay?
The damage wasn't bad?

20:26.480 --> 20:29.640
Not too bad. No stress.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.840
We're just concerned with things being
perfectly flawless when we return them.

20:32.920 --> 20:35.680
- [explosion]
- [metal clanking]

20:43.240 --> 20:46.720
Shit, I forgot that the fuel tank is
in the front!

20:46.800 --> 20:48.200
Fuck!

20:51.640 --> 20:55.680
So, Dag, how is the deal
with insurance on this thing?

20:55.760 --> 20:58.480
Mm...

20:58.560 --> 21:01.280
[mutters]

21:01.360 --> 21:06.040
I don't think this is an obvious case
for the insurers.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.760
[Torgeir] No, it isn't.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.160
But there is no need to panic.

21:10.240 --> 21:13.000
We'll just report the car
stolen, and then...

21:13.080 --> 21:15.040
...you, Dag, you can take care

21:15.120 --> 21:18.360
of some paperwork and
such-and-such with the seller.

21:18.440 --> 21:20.640
You're awesome at that sort of stuff.

21:20.720 --> 21:23.920
Well, yes, I... I don't know.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.640
Do as Torgeir says.

21:26.640 --> 21:28.400
[in English]
Okay?

21:30.480 --> 21:32.320
Great.
This will work itself out.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.440
[hiccups, coughs]

21:34.520 --> 21:36.120
Mm.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.320
[hip-hop playing on headphones]

21:41.160 --> 21:43.000
[thud]

21:43.080 --> 21:44.960
Hello?

21:54.840 --> 21:56.440
Hey!

21:56.520 --> 21:59.080
[in Norwegian]
Help! Stop it!

21:59.160 --> 22:01.840
[shouts]

22:14.320 --> 22:18.520
Please, let me go.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.280
Don't do it.

22:20.360 --> 22:23.440
Please.
You can't do this to me.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.600
Sorry about all the drama.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.280
We didn't wanna spoil the surprise.

22:37.240 --> 22:40.120
Remember that little chat we had?

22:40.200 --> 22:41.840
[in English]
Yeah?

22:41.920 --> 22:44.360
Yeah, well, suddenly it hit me.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.400
What if he's right?

22:46.480 --> 22:49.400
Maybe I'm not contributing
enough to the community.

22:49.480 --> 22:52.920
So... had this idea.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.760
We built the ramp
for you and the kids.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.200
[in Norwegian]
So... all this...

23:07.280 --> 23:09.680
...is a skate hall for me and the kids?

23:09.760 --> 23:12.400
I was in a community mood.

23:12.480 --> 23:14.200
It's insane, man.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.720
It's plywood all over.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.320
This must've set you back quite a bit.

23:19.400 --> 23:23.040
Only the best for my kids' priest.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.880
[chuckles]

23:40.640 --> 23:43.240
[in Norwegian]
Hi. Gee, service sure is great here.

23:43.320 --> 23:47.240
Of course,
a bit extra on a big day like this.

23:47.320 --> 23:50.200
Oh, but what do we have here?

23:50.280 --> 23:52.320
Why, hello there.
[chuckles]

23:52.400 --> 23:53.560
Yes.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.480
They're getting baptized today.

23:55.560 --> 23:58.280
Oh, my.
What are the names?

23:58.360 --> 24:00.360
Asbjørn and then Asbjørg.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.240
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.560
Those are nice names, aren't they?

24:06.640 --> 24:08.200
Well, no.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.200
Tell that to my nephew,
who's also named Asbjørn.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.080
Went to Australia to study medicine.

24:14.160 --> 24:18.400
Everyone just called him "Asshole."

24:18.480 --> 24:23.040
Got so bad he came home
after the first semester.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.520
My God, how sad.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.600
Yeah, well, no harm.

24:26.680 --> 24:30.200
He's in the snow removal
business now instead.

24:30.280 --> 24:32.920
You just go
for whatever names you like.

24:33.000 --> 24:36.800
You never know, maybe these two
don't wanna study abroad

24:36.880 --> 24:41.360
or be on Facebook like the other kids.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.880
[priest in Norwegian]
As a lot of you know,

24:43.960 --> 24:46.520
I've railed down the roof
at the Opera House

24:46.600 --> 24:50.120
in the rain,
and that was awesome.

24:50.200 --> 24:53.600
But nothing measures up

24:53.680 --> 24:57.400
to welcoming two small new members

24:57.480 --> 25:00.640
to the club of us who dig Jesus.

25:03.520 --> 25:06.000
God save your exit

25:06.080 --> 25:08.080
and your entry

25:08.160 --> 25:10.320
from now and forever.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.600
I draw you with the sign
of the holy cross

25:13.680 --> 25:17.680
and in the name
of the Father, the Son

25:17.760 --> 25:20.320
and the Holy Spirit,

25:20.400 --> 25:22.800
I christen thee Asbjørn and--

25:22.880 --> 25:25.400
[in English]
No, wait, wait.

25:36.080 --> 25:37.400
Apologies.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.720
I christen thee

25:39.800 --> 25:42.000
Bjørn and Bjørg.

25:42.080 --> 25:45.560
[bells chiming]

25:45.640 --> 25:48.080
[organ playing]

25:53.400 --> 25:54.440
Padre.

26:00.520 --> 26:03.440
[radio playing indistinctly]

26:36.440 --> 26:38.560
Are you hiding from me?

26:38.640 --> 26:39.880
No.

26:39.960 --> 26:40.960
Oh.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.520
Well, I sincerely hope
you've got my Ferrari

26:44.600 --> 26:47.320
or a pile of cash
lying around here somewhere.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.640
[gulps]

26:49.720 --> 26:51.360
[sighs]

26:51.440 --> 26:53.280
Please sit down.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.440
I have some...

26:57.560 --> 27:00.560
...not-so-good news.

27:00.640 --> 27:05.360
I take my not-so-good news
like I take my blow jobs.

27:05.440 --> 27:07.400
Stood up.

27:08.680 --> 27:12.600
You see, um... the car is stolen.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.240
- Stolen?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:14.320 --> 27:18.840
But all I need is a signature
on some papers.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.920
Paperwork really ain't my cup of tea.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.920
Why don't you just take me
to the gentleman

27:25.000 --> 27:26.720
that's borrowed my car?

27:26.800 --> 27:28.560
I think it's about time me and him

27:28.640 --> 27:30.960
had a little bit of a chitchat,
don't you?

27:31.040 --> 27:33.120
Um...

27:33.200 --> 27:34.880
I'm so sorry.

27:34.960 --> 27:38.120
We-- We have issues with, um,

27:38.200 --> 27:40.000
professional secrecy here.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.800
Oh.

27:41.880 --> 27:43.720
Do you know
what I have issues with?

27:43.800 --> 27:46.120
No.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.040
Dishonesty.

27:48.120 --> 27:50.760
I can't tolerate it.

27:52.360 --> 27:54.880
I think it's about time
I told you a story

27:54.960 --> 27:58.040
about my football-supporting days.

27:59.920 --> 28:01.680
I follow a team called Millwall.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.320
You heard of us?

28:03.400 --> 28:06.160
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

28:06.240 --> 28:08.320
Well, back in the day,

28:08.400 --> 28:11.720
we had a bit of a reputation
for being a little bit naughty.

28:11.800 --> 28:14.480
Can you believe that? [chuckles]

28:17.160 --> 28:19.160
On this one occasion,

28:19.240 --> 28:21.800
the Old Bill, they come up
with this new set of rules

28:21.880 --> 28:25.600
that made it virtually impossible
for us to take weapons into the matches.

28:25.680 --> 28:28.120
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Killjoys.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.440
So one of our lads,
really creative geezer,

28:31.520 --> 28:34.120
came up with this genius idea.

28:48.640 --> 28:49.800
Excuse me.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.160
[unzips]

28:57.680 --> 29:00.080
[whistling]

29:04.760 --> 29:07.280
[grunts]

29:07.360 --> 29:09.640
We called it...

29:09.720 --> 29:12.360
...the Millwall Brick.

29:12.440 --> 29:14.520
[urine dripping]

29:14.680 --> 29:16.680
Now...

29:17.560 --> 29:21.080
...do you wanna start talking to me,

29:21.160 --> 29:24.960
or do you wanna start talking
to the brick?

29:30.800 --> 29:33.400
[laughter]

29:33.480 --> 29:35.720
[cell phone rings]

29:38.160 --> 29:39.760
[in Norwegian]
Hello? It's Jan.

29:42.040 --> 29:44.120
Huh.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.680
[in English]
That's from me.

29:45.760 --> 29:48.520
This is nice. I think.

29:48.600 --> 29:51.640
Yeah?
I knitted it on my own.

29:51.720 --> 29:54.200
- You know, I believe that.
- Yeah.

29:54.280 --> 29:55.760
[in Norwegian]
But it isn't finished yet.

29:55.840 --> 29:58.120
It needs the reverse seam
and the regular seam,

29:58.200 --> 30:00.120
which I have not quite finished.
I didn't have time.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.120
It turned out
to be too much, really.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.800
Brother, have you been so clever
as to knit for the little babies?

30:04.880 --> 30:06.600
You are so childish.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.560
[in English]
I'm sorry, but I have to go to the...

30:08.640 --> 30:10.280
[in Norwegian]
...refugee center lady.

30:10.360 --> 30:11.680
Emergencies.

30:11.760 --> 30:15.120
You go right ahead.
Take care of business.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.440
I am very proud to say

30:23.520 --> 30:26.280
the moose
we are serving here today

30:26.360 --> 30:30.600
was shot by none other
than the godfather himself.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.800
Let's hear it for him.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.120
- Salute!
- [all in Norwegian] Cheers.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.760
Cheers, Papa.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.600
[in Norwegian]
I hope you will enjoy eating it

30:43.680 --> 30:45.880
as much as I enjoyed killing it.

30:45.960 --> 30:47.280
Bon appétit.

30:47.360 --> 30:49.480
My boy, huh?

30:51.160 --> 30:52.840
Ja.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.440
Hello.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.080
Randi.

30:59.520 --> 31:03.200
[pop music playing]

31:12.520 --> 31:15.080
Hi, hi, Randi.

31:15.160 --> 31:16.680
Hi.

31:16.760 --> 31:19.800
[in Norwegian]
Wow, what are you doing here?

31:19.880 --> 31:21.880
You don't remember calling?

31:21.960 --> 31:24.080
You said there was an African
man with a knife in his mouth

31:24.160 --> 31:26.320
outside your window.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.920
No. My God, how awkward.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.080
I must've called you in my sleep.

31:31.160 --> 31:34.360
Yes. Wasn't no dream, Randi.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.440
Khat psychosis.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.600
You have chewed enough African Salad

31:39.680 --> 31:42.120
to feed a Somalian football team.

31:42.200 --> 31:44.480
It is total chaos here.

31:44.560 --> 31:46.200
You are not capable to live on your own.

31:53.160 --> 31:55.400
[tapping on glass]

31:59.600 --> 32:00.600
[in Norwegian]
"Dear..."

32:00.680 --> 32:02.640
[whispers in Norwegian]

32:07.000 --> 32:08.640
"Dear Asbjørn and Asbjørg."

32:08.720 --> 32:10.120
Bjørn and Bjørg.

32:10.200 --> 32:13.000
Yes, Bjørn and Bjørg.

32:13.080 --> 32:15.760
"It's an honor to stand here
as godfather.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.400
Usually, when you hold speeches
like this,

32:17.480 --> 32:20.400
you start out with a funny story.

32:20.520 --> 32:22.760
So I thought I'd open
with a misunderstanding

32:22.840 --> 32:25.960
that was quite funny.

32:26.040 --> 32:27.960
Johnny is a Catholic, right?

32:28.040 --> 32:31.280
So for months I've been worrying
about the circumcision.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.480
Like, do I need to hold the kid's cock

32:33.560 --> 32:35.480
while they chop it?

32:35.560 --> 32:37.880
Because I do not like cock or blood."

32:37.960 --> 32:39.160
Johnny.

32:39.240 --> 32:41.560
"But fortunately,
my knowledgeable friend..."

32:45.840 --> 32:47.240
[in English]
Okay.

32:47.320 --> 32:50.440
[in Norwegian]
But religion and politics

32:50.520 --> 32:52.440
don't belong at baptisms.

32:52.520 --> 32:56.680
So back to the stars
of this evening, the twins.

32:56.760 --> 32:59.640
- Dear Bjørn and Bjørg--
- [coughs]

32:59.720 --> 33:02.440
[in Norwegian]
Dad, are you okay? What...?

33:02.520 --> 33:06.160
You are bleeding. Come.

33:06.240 --> 33:09.840
He is bleeding from his mouth.
Dad, are you okay?

33:09.920 --> 33:11.240
What the fuck?

33:23.960 --> 33:26.920
Oh, Daddy. Doesn't it stop?

33:27.000 --> 33:29.720
Oh. Try holding it close to--

33:29.800 --> 33:31.760
- You okay, my old friend?
-  Ja.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.160
[in English] We have to leave now.
I can't stop this.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.520
What happened?
He lose a filling?

33:36.600 --> 33:39.600
I think you should ask your godfather
how he really shot that moose.

33:42.240 --> 33:43.800
Ja, ja.

33:43.880 --> 33:46.800
[in Norwegian]
You're bleeding all over.

33:49.240 --> 33:52.200
Fucking pieces of metal?

33:52.280 --> 33:56.200
Please tell me you are not serving
roadkill at my kids' baptism?

33:56.280 --> 33:57.640
- What--?
- Shut up!

33:57.720 --> 33:59.240
What kind of godfather are you?

33:59.320 --> 34:03.160
I should have picked somebody
more responsible, like Jan.

34:03.240 --> 34:06.600
[in English]
I-I-I didn't-- No--

34:06.680 --> 34:09.600
How could--? It's--

34:11.520 --> 34:14.040
It's pretty obvious to both of us
that you need a little help

34:14.120 --> 34:16.640
to straighten up that refugee
center of yours, so...

34:20.520 --> 34:25.680
So I have drafted an agreement

34:25.760 --> 34:28.520
on how we could cooperate.

34:35.040 --> 34:39.240
I have no plans to sell this place.
And especially not for such a price.

34:39.360 --> 34:42.600
You'd rather I report
to the UDI that they've placed

34:42.680 --> 34:46.800
the fate of traumatized war victims
in the hands of a junkie?

34:46.880 --> 34:51.760
You can't treat an old
conference buddy like this.

34:51.840 --> 34:54.640
Have you forgotten that night
at the Desmond Tutu conference?

34:54.720 --> 34:57.680
Oh, that night? Exactly.

34:57.760 --> 35:01.560
Do you know how many times
I tried reaching you since?

35:01.640 --> 35:03.960
You didn't even bother
to answer, did you?

35:04.040 --> 35:05.800
I put up with it.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.640
But that was the old Jan.

35:07.720 --> 35:10.480
That obedient little bitch
that wagged its tail

35:10.560 --> 35:12.480
hoping that everyone would like him.

35:12.560 --> 35:14.480
[in high voice]
"Could you get some coffee, Jan?"

35:14.560 --> 35:16.640
"Could you sort these documents

35:16.720 --> 35:20.080
while I spend a romantic weekend
with my lover?"

35:21.240 --> 35:24.200
[in normal voice] Do you know
what happened to that little bitch?

35:24.280 --> 35:27.120
It died when I was fired from NAV.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.200
What you're seeing now
is a real fucking pit bull.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.120
And it ain't particularly tame!

35:32.200 --> 35:35.080
Sign this!

35:44.640 --> 35:47.600
The new Jan frightens me.

35:47.680 --> 35:51.800
But he also gets your panties
a bit wet, doesn't he?

35:57.680 --> 35:59.920
[laughing]

36:16.200 --> 36:18.400
[tapping on door]

36:21.000 --> 36:23.960
[in English]
Is the party over already?

36:24.040 --> 36:25.240
Yeah.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.480
It took a wrong turn

36:27.560 --> 36:30.880
when car parts started
showing up in the dinner.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.040
Oops.

36:32.120 --> 36:35.040
Maybe...

36:35.120 --> 36:37.800
...this will help?

36:37.880 --> 36:39.040
What's this?

36:39.120 --> 36:41.400
[in Norwegian]
Randi has been kind enough

36:41.480 --> 36:43.000
to invite us on board.

36:43.080 --> 36:46.480
[in English]
We're co-owners, man.

36:46.560 --> 36:48.680
This looks like quite a bargain.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.520
It's worth 10 times this price.

36:50.600 --> 36:54.200
[in Norwegian] The leader there had
a weak spot for a type of herb

36:54.280 --> 36:56.080
that you don't exactly get
at your local grocer.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.680
It made for...

36:57.760 --> 36:59.960
[in English]
...a good climate for negotiation.

37:00.040 --> 37:01.960
[laughs]

37:02.040 --> 37:04.480
You know, you are a fast learner.

37:04.560 --> 37:08.360
Ah. I have a great teacher, that's all.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.320
Come here.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.640
[in Norwegian]
Private party tonight.

37:21.720 --> 37:23.560
[in English]
I'm here to deliver some flowers.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.040
[in English]
What kind of flowers?

37:25.120 --> 37:27.400
Forget-me-nots.
[cackles]

37:27.480 --> 37:29.480
God, you went down like a sack of shit.

37:29.560 --> 37:32.160
[in Norwegian]
What is happening with him?

37:39.640 --> 37:43.680
Good evening,
you bunch of seal fuckers!

37:43.760 --> 37:46.880
Somebody in this fucking shithole

37:46.960 --> 37:50.520
has borrowed
my beautiful yellow Ferrari.

37:50.600 --> 37:54.080
I would like it back.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.480
Please.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.800
Fucking cunt!

38:01.640 --> 38:04.160
Come on in, you fucking fags!

38:07.600 --> 38:12.200
Vikings!
I fucking shit 'em!

38:16.040 --> 38:18.520
Are you a hero?

38:19.680 --> 38:22.280
Nice and steady.
That's it.

38:23.280 --> 38:26.280
- [breath quivering]
- Shh.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.600
You got it.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.600
Bang!

38:33.680 --> 38:35.280
[laughs]

38:35.360 --> 38:38.240
I never fired a gun before.

38:38.320 --> 38:39.800
Does this work?

38:39.880 --> 38:43.240
[laughs]
Fuck me. Whoo!

38:44.800 --> 38:46.440
[waitresses shout]

38:46.520 --> 38:48.560
Whoo-hoo!

38:48.640 --> 38:51.040
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

38:51.160 --> 38:53.080
What's going on over here?

38:53.160 --> 38:56.160
Are you the proprietor
of this establishment?

38:56.240 --> 38:58.240
Yeah, this is my club.

38:58.320 --> 39:00.360
And you're making quite a mess of it.

39:00.440 --> 39:02.400
Am I?

39:02.480 --> 39:04.640
Oh, yeah.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.720
It appears that one of your clientèle

39:07.800 --> 39:10.160
has misplaced my vehicle.

39:14.160 --> 39:16.200
Come on, my friend.

39:16.280 --> 39:18.120
Let's have a drink.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.040
We'll take it easy.

39:20.120 --> 39:22.440
You're not my friend, I don't drink,

39:22.520 --> 39:26.160
and I haven't taken it easy since 1981.

39:29.600 --> 39:34.680
Now, where is my fucking car?!

39:36.120 --> 39:38.720
Oh, I wish I could help you find it,

39:38.800 --> 39:43.520
so I could stick it up
your fucking limey ass.

39:43.600 --> 39:46.280
I'd like to propose a toast.

39:48.120 --> 39:50.200
To one less American.

39:53.080 --> 39:55.040
[choking]

40:21.320 --> 40:23.960
[panting]

40:27.080 --> 40:31.120
Jesus, fuck,
what was that all about?

40:31.200 --> 40:34.160
Long story.

40:34.240 --> 40:37.240
I'll make time.

40:37.320 --> 40:38.960
Jesus.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.280
Oh, God.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.600
- Well, boys...
- [gags]

40:48.680 --> 40:52.040
I could lecture you for days
on the magnitude of this fuckup.

40:52.120 --> 40:55.120
[spits, gasps]

40:55.200 --> 40:59.680
But I, uh, think we better get
to the task at hand.

40:59.760 --> 41:01.040
Now, uh...

41:01.120 --> 41:03.400
Excuse me.

41:03.480 --> 41:05.280
[groans]

41:08.800 --> 41:10.000
[door slams]

41:10.080 --> 41:13.320
This is what we're gonna do.

41:13.400 --> 41:16.040
Bring the car up to Faberg Bridge,

41:16.120 --> 41:20.320
bring Wayne Rooney's
ugly brother with you.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.440
Make it look like a traction problem.

41:22.520 --> 41:24.320
A traction problem?

41:24.400 --> 41:26.680
Did I say questions?

41:26.760 --> 41:27.880
Not exactly.

41:27.960 --> 41:30.720
Then shut the fuck up.

41:30.800 --> 41:32.520
You got this?

41:32.600 --> 41:34.120
[in Norwegian]
Guess it makes sense

41:34.200 --> 41:36.680
for the people who made
this mess to clean it up.

41:36.760 --> 41:38.920
And with those words of wisdom,

41:39.000 --> 41:41.440
I bid you adieu.

42:06.240 --> 42:08.960
Oh, so that's
where you've been hiding.

42:13.720 --> 42:15.280
What's up, buddy?

42:15.360 --> 42:17.880
Didn't you see his eyes?

42:19.680 --> 42:22.640
Yeah, yeah, I saw his eyes.
Did you see his gun?

42:22.720 --> 42:25.560
You did what you had to do in there.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.840
Yeah.
I always fuck up, you know?

42:31.320 --> 42:33.400
Well, I can't disagree with you there.

42:33.480 --> 42:37.040
But taking on that crazy fuck

42:37.120 --> 42:39.120
with knitting equipment?

42:39.200 --> 42:41.520
That took   cojones.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.280
Ja.

42:43.360 --> 42:46.120
Yeah, I'm a fuckup.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.320
Come on.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.920
Pull yourself together, godfather.

42:55.480 --> 42:58.680
I'm still the godfather?

42:58.760 --> 43:02.160
Yeah. You saved our ass
in there last night.

43:02.240 --> 43:04.360
But what about, uh, Jan?

43:04.440 --> 43:07.040
Isn't he more of a responsible type?

43:07.120 --> 43:09.200
[sighs]

43:09.280 --> 43:12.160
Look, uh, Jan,

43:12.240 --> 43:15.440
he's good for business,

43:15.520 --> 43:18.720
but he don't have the heart.

43:18.800 --> 43:21.680
Okay. So I'm still the godfather.

43:21.760 --> 43:24.720
I promise I won't fuck up again.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.360
Let's not get too hasty with the promises.

43:30.440 --> 43:33.600
Let's just take it one day at a time.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.160
Yeah.

43:43.000 --> 43:45.600
I'm still the godfather.

43:45.680 --> 43:47.560
I'm still the godfather.

43:50.680 --> 43:52.280
[dial tone]

43:54.360 --> 43:56.720
- [man]  Hello?
- Danny? It's me, Rosemary.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.280
Look, I ain't got long, babe,
so just listen, okay?

43:59.360 --> 44:00.880
Of course, babe.

44:00.960 --> 44:03.200
Me and your brother have had
one of our rows, yeah?

44:03.280 --> 44:04.960
But this time it's different.

44:05.040 --> 44:07.120
He was supposed to meet me
at the hotel last night,

44:07.200 --> 44:10.000
- but he didn't show up.
- Okay.

44:10.080 --> 44:12.520
I think something's happened to him.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.560
Just come out, will you?

44:14.640 --> 44:19.280
I'm flat broke, I'm all alone,
and I'm in fucking Lillehammer.

44:19.360 --> 44:21.400
Okay, Rosie, I'll just finish
some business here.

44:21.480 --> 44:23.440
I'll come right over.

44:23.520 --> 44:25.960
[man sobbing]

44:29.920 --> 44:34.200
