00:04.671 --> 00:06.605
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.607 --> 00:10.676
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:10.678 --> 00:12.745
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.747 --> 00:15.247
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.249 --> 00:17.683
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:17.685 --> 00:20.119
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.121 --> 00:21.587
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>

00:21.589 --> 00:23.022
<i>Only we can solve.</i>

00:23.024 --> 00:24.790
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:24.792 --> 00:26.625
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.061
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.063 --> 00:31.330
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.332 --> 00:33.465
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.467 --> 00:35.701
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:35.703 --> 00:38.537
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.539 --> 00:40.472
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:40.707 --> 00:42.775
â™ª

00:47.614 --> 00:51.683
Hey. Uh, reservation for two,
under curtis.

01:01.761 --> 01:05.130
Can I get you a drink
while you wait for
your other party?

01:05.132 --> 01:08.200
Uh, no, thanks.
He'll be here any minute.

01:09.636 --> 01:11.403
Baseball announcer:
One and one.

01:11.405 --> 01:13.405
Baker waiting again.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.774
Brock at second,
russell on first.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.776
And the pitch on the way.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.612
â™ª

01:24.517 --> 01:26.785
One and one.

01:28.855 --> 01:30.389
Another refill?

01:30.391 --> 01:32.224
I'm gonna kill him.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.699
â™ª
(loud hammering)

01:43.503 --> 01:45.537
Probability
theory dictates

01:45.539 --> 01:47.739
That one cannot
predict the future

01:47.741 --> 01:49.274
With any absolute
certainty.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.110
But this is an exception--
there is zero chance

01:51.112 --> 01:52.377
That she will accept
your apology.

01:52.379 --> 01:54.179
I'm not gonna apologize;
I'm gonna grovel.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.681
Sylvester:
Understood, but still
there's a high likelihood

01:55.683 --> 01:58.417
That she will throw
something at you.
Stop talking.

01:58.419 --> 01:59.585
Good luck.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.653
(hammer strikes loudly)

02:01.655 --> 02:03.856
Peace offering.

02:06.826 --> 02:09.194
These chocolates have nuts.

02:09.196 --> 02:11.296
Get it? Nuts?

02:14.167 --> 02:15.634
Is this thing on?

02:16.603 --> 02:18.370
I don't have
any feelings,

02:18.372 --> 02:21.373
And even
I'm uncomfortable
watching this.

02:21.375 --> 02:23.142
John 8:32. "the truth
will set you free."

02:23.144 --> 02:25.144
The truth is
I'm an idiot.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.345
I was nervous
about our date,

02:26.347 --> 02:28.247
So I took an alprazolam.

02:28.249 --> 02:30.415
Apparently, I should've
taken a half.

02:30.417 --> 02:33.652
Because I didn't wake up
till 6:00 a.M.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.655
So I'd be so humbled
if you'd please

02:36.657 --> 02:38.323
Accept these.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.492
I anticipated that.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.561
Frank! You're on!

02:44.831 --> 02:46.331
(frank clears throat)

02:46.333 --> 02:47.533
(plays note)

02:47.535 --> 02:49.234
â™ª to err is human,
to forgive divine â™ª

02:49.236 --> 02:52.204
â™ª toby'd like to buy ya some
cheese and some wine... â™ª

02:52.206 --> 02:54.907
Toby:
Frank, get out of here.
It's not safe.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.180
â™ª

03:01.182 --> 03:03.849
(hammer strikes loudly)

03:03.851 --> 03:05.584
(hammer striking in distance)

03:05.586 --> 03:07.853
Well, that didn't
go so well, did it?

03:07.855 --> 03:09.855
Wow, that's very
astute, 197.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.924
An observation?

03:11.926 --> 03:15.260
You learned
a very inexpensive lesson.

03:15.262 --> 03:16.795
Workplace entanglements

03:16.797 --> 03:17.930
Are ill-advised,
destined to fail,

03:17.932 --> 03:19.531
Not to mention disruptive to...

03:19.533 --> 03:21.200
Business.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.768
Oh, well, business
will have to suffer,

03:22.770 --> 03:23.969
'cause I'm not giving up.

03:23.971 --> 03:27.806
I'm imploring you to let it go.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.808
Romance and work are...

03:29.810 --> 03:31.443
Oil and water.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.913
Um, this is...

03:34.915 --> 03:37.416
Exhibit a

03:37.418 --> 03:38.817
For affective
dysregulation,

03:38.819 --> 03:40.919
The inability to
regulate feelings.

03:40.921 --> 03:42.955
You couldn't even
bring yourself to
erase stick figures

03:42.957 --> 03:44.923
Of you and paige
holding hands.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.459
I just wiped down the board--
I didn't pay attention

03:47.461 --> 03:48.493
To every last mark.

03:48.495 --> 03:50.229
Even more
affective dysregulation,

03:50.231 --> 03:51.830
You emotional dumpster fire.

03:51.832 --> 03:52.798
This clearly

03:52.800 --> 03:56.568
Of your feelings for her,
and drew's coming back soon.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.637
So all I'm saying is,
if you sit on the sidelines,

03:58.639 --> 03:59.905
You are going to lose this game.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.608
Oh. Sports.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.576
My favorite.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.447
Yeah.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.915
Maya hernandez, an accountant

04:09.917 --> 04:11.883
For the violent
nicaraguan criminal organization

04:11.885 --> 04:14.019
Known as the dl,
was shot at yesterday

04:14.021 --> 04:15.988
While being transferred
to court,

04:15.990 --> 04:18.290
Barely escaping with her life.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.759
Hey, happy is smelting
titanium over copper,

04:20.761 --> 04:23.395
Resulting in an inefficient
transfer of electrons.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.830
Should I call the cops?

04:24.832 --> 04:25.931
What?

04:25.933 --> 04:27.899
No. She's...

04:27.901 --> 04:30.736
Clearly distracted
by her issues with toby.

04:30.738 --> 04:33.338
Discord is...
Bad for the team.

04:33.340 --> 04:35.674
You need to make sure
that things go back

04:35.676 --> 04:39.845
(ringtone playing)
to the way that they were
prior to this dating nonsense.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.281
Consider it done.

04:43.049 --> 04:44.850
I have a problem.

04:44.852 --> 04:45.951
Okay.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.353
Hello.
Uh, this is the last cup

04:48.355 --> 04:50.055
Of the discontinued
boysenberry blast

04:50.057 --> 04:51.790
That was in the fridge.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.493
The "sell by" date
was two days ago.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.527
And?

04:56.863 --> 05:00.299
And do I eat it, risk a
raging bacterial infection?

05:00.301 --> 05:02.301
That's what
you're worried about?
Uh-huh.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.002
That woman there...

05:04.004 --> 05:06.505
Is the target of
a vicious crime syndicate,

05:06.507 --> 05:08.473
And you're worried
about yogurt?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.075
Hernandez, who has
well...

05:10.077 --> 05:12.044
Intimate knowledge
of the financial workings

05:12.046 --> 05:15.614
Is set to testify
against the cartel next week

05:15.616 --> 05:17.049
In ventura county,

05:17.051 --> 05:18.583
Where the venue
has been reassigned

05:18.585 --> 05:21.853
After this recent attempt
on ms. Hernandez' life.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.989
The dl is led
by hector menjivar,

05:23.991 --> 05:26.391
Seen here in a 2009 mug shot,

05:26.393 --> 05:29.795
When he was sentenced to three
years for aggravated assault.

05:29.797 --> 05:33.598
Imagine having those
guys after you.
New case.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.901
Oh. Well,
what is it?
Them.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.942
The dl crept up from
nicaragua in the '80s.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.944
Started out in
carting, trucking.

05:45.946 --> 05:49.014
Small-timers who did
little more than rigged
bids to get jobs.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.416
After a while, they graduated
to shipping for hire.

05:51.418 --> 05:54.453
Drugs, guns, bodies,
whatever you wanted
to move discreetly,

05:54.455 --> 05:56.922
They carried
in their trucks
for the price.

05:56.924 --> 05:58.724
Their boss,
hector menjivar.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.726
Government's been trying
to nail him forever.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.128
Guy's slippery.
And this witness,
maya hernandez,

06:03.130 --> 06:06.064
She was part of their group?
Pickett:
She's a civilian.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.667
A neighborhood girl who took
a job as their bookkeeper

06:08.669 --> 06:11.703
Her husband was a driver.
They had no idea

06:11.705 --> 06:14.072
Who they were really working
for until it was too late.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.674
Did you say her husband
<i>was</i> a driver?

06:15.676 --> 06:17.042
He was killed
a few months ago.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.111
Rival runners took him out
just north of san francisco.

06:19.113 --> 06:21.613
Collateral damage
in hector's war to
expand his territory.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.915
That's why she wants
to help shut down the dl.

06:24.984 --> 06:26.551
People are scared of these guys.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.920
They don't normally testify
of their own free will.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.489
But we can't find the books

06:30.491 --> 06:32.157
Outlining
these guys' activities.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.658
She's the linchpin.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.394
So you trumped up
a conspiracy claim,

06:35.396 --> 06:37.396
Make it seem like
she was part of it,

06:37.398 --> 06:40.399
And then told her you
would drop the charges
only if she testified.

06:40.401 --> 06:43.168
We are giving her protection.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.470
She almost got shot to ribbons
under your protection.

06:45.472 --> 06:47.105
That's why <i>we're</i> here.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.908
To assist the u.S. Marshals
in strategizing

06:49.910 --> 06:52.711
A safe means of transport
for the witness

06:52.713 --> 06:55.414
From l.A. To ventura. Sly?

06:55.416 --> 06:57.416
We suggest

06:57.418 --> 07:00.051
Losing the standard parallel
formation, instead employing

07:00.053 --> 07:01.553
A convoy configuration,

07:01.555 --> 07:03.555
Which reduces surface area
and vulnerabilities

07:03.557 --> 07:06.091
That were exploited
by the dl's last attack.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.726
We put ms. Hernandez
in the fourth suv,

07:07.728 --> 07:10.195
Owing to the rule of threes--
the human brain fatigues

07:10.197 --> 07:12.998
After viewing the third object
in a row of pattern,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.167
Making the fourth vehicle
the safest spot psychologically.

07:15.169 --> 07:16.735
Also, we use

07:16.737 --> 07:19.938
Decoy cars, because,
well, decoys work.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.140
Lastly, maya needs
to be wearing this.

07:23.176 --> 07:25.744
She's a witness,
not a prisoner.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.447
Yeah. There are
prisoner transfers at
the courthouse every day.

07:28.449 --> 07:31.116
The dl will be looking for
someone in civilian clothing.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.785
So the bright orange jumpsuit
actually disguises her.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.021
All right. Anything else?

07:36.023 --> 07:38.490
My team will follow the convoy
with cabe,

07:38.492 --> 07:40.192
Providing a mobile tech hub.

07:40.194 --> 07:43.595
Walter:
Sylvester will hack the gps
systems to clear traffic.

07:43.597 --> 07:46.064
Happy will handle any mechanical
issues; toby will scan

07:46.066 --> 07:47.966
The route to predict
attack patterns.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.935
I will ride with you and maya

07:49.937 --> 07:51.136
To quarterback
and make real-time adjustments.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.072
So, are you capable
of keeping up with us?

07:54.074 --> 07:55.674
Well, you know

07:55.676 --> 07:58.243
What they say:
Good, fast, polite--

07:58.245 --> 08:01.146
Pick two.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.748
Maya:
Lady, this jumpsuit
is too small for me.

08:03.750 --> 08:04.950
It's a four.
You said four.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.651
Oh, I guess prison fashion
runs really small.

08:06.653 --> 08:07.786
I can get you another.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.055
Whatever.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.823
I'm sorry about
your husband.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.058
We'll protect you.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.960
Protect me? Lady,

08:14.962 --> 08:16.761
Paige.
Please... Paige...

08:16.763 --> 08:19.531
You guys are
just taking me to my funeral.

08:19.533 --> 08:23.068
What I'm wearing, right?
I'm just gonna be buried in it.

08:24.070 --> 08:26.605
I'll be with cabe.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.907
Be careful.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.976
â™ª

08:33.613 --> 08:36.915
Sylvester, do you have a clear
path for us to the freeway?

08:36.917 --> 08:39.050
I'm spoofing fake phones
with static gps

08:39.052 --> 08:41.253
All along our route
to simulate gridlock

08:41.255 --> 08:42.821
All the way
to the entrance ramp.

08:42.823 --> 08:47.058
<i>No one will be on our route.</i>
<i>Smooth sailing.</i>

08:48.027 --> 08:49.995
All right, we're
passing grand avenue.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.197
Straight ahead
for another 5.6 miles.

08:52.199 --> 08:56.201
Excuse me.
Why are we slowing down?
School bus ahead.

08:56.203 --> 08:59.004
Walter:
<i>Not a neighborhood</i>
<i>you take class trips to.</i>

08:59.006 --> 09:01.106
There are no schools
in this area.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.073
I don't see any children

09:02.075 --> 09:03.942
<i>On that bus.</i>

09:03.944 --> 09:05.176
It's an ambush.
It's an ambush.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.913
<i>They're cutting us off!</i>

09:07.915 --> 09:09.748
Maya:
Oh, my god, they've got guns!

09:09.750 --> 09:11.783
(automatic gunfire)

09:12.919 --> 09:14.085
All suv's scatter. Repeat:

09:14.087 --> 09:15.053
Scatter!

09:16.022 --> 09:16.955
(gunfire)

09:20.126 --> 09:21.860
(tires squeal)

09:23.129 --> 09:25.196
Paige: Walter,
you have any eyes on them?

09:25.198 --> 09:27.666
Nothing. Passing
38th and spring.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.967
Got it. Recalibrating route.

09:28.969 --> 09:31.102
â™ª

09:36.309 --> 09:38.610
Check this out.
Truck at six o'clock.

09:38.612 --> 09:40.345
No front license plate.
Coming in fast.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.980
Turn into the alley.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.181
Changing course.

09:46.152 --> 09:47.052
False alarm.

09:47.054 --> 09:48.086
False alarm. We're clear.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.688
Okay, continue north.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.056
There's a highway entrance

09:51.058 --> 09:51.957
Half a mile away.

09:51.959 --> 09:52.591
Copy that.

09:55.962 --> 09:58.196
(crashing)
maya: Oh!

09:59.332 --> 10:01.099
Maya:
It's him.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.233
How'd they know
which suv we were in?

10:02.235 --> 10:03.635
What's going on?

10:03.637 --> 10:04.336
Cabe, it's hector.

10:07.974 --> 10:09.207
Get us the hell
out of here!

10:10.209 --> 10:12.210
Axle must have cracked.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.211
We're not goin'
anywhere.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.014
This entire vehicle's
bulletproof.

10:16.016 --> 10:17.215
If we shoot,
it'll ricochet

10:17.217 --> 10:18.683
Off the glass
and kill us.

10:20.653 --> 10:21.219
Get down!

10:32.932 --> 10:35.000
What is he doing?

10:36.369 --> 10:38.136
What is he doing?

10:43.009 --> 10:44.776
I want the girl.

10:59.959 --> 11:00.759
I want the girl.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.161
I said give me the girl!

11:03.829 --> 11:05.764
We need backup.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.732
Impact destroyed
the radio.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.835
Cabe, we need help.
We're near 36th and avalon.

11:10.837 --> 11:11.770
We'll be there in four minutes.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.872
<i>Sending for backup now.</i>

11:14.907 --> 11:16.274
(grunts)

11:16.276 --> 11:17.208
(screams)
he knows

11:17.210 --> 11:18.309
He can't break the windows

11:18.311 --> 11:19.844
So he's going
for the door locks.

11:19.846 --> 11:20.278
(grunts)

11:20.280 --> 11:24.049
The shotgun. Give me the shells.
Give me the shells. Now.
Why do you want...

11:24.051 --> 11:24.949
Walter:
<i>Come on.</i>

11:25.918 --> 11:27.919
Okay, okay.
(grunts)

11:27.921 --> 11:30.455
If we can get these shells
hot enough, they'll combust.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.090
He's gonna get in!

11:32.092 --> 11:33.391
The gas! Floor it!

11:33.393 --> 11:35.960
(engine revving)

11:37.129 --> 11:39.798
All right,
there's a hose in there

11:39.800 --> 11:42.133
That leads to the heater core
which is next to the engine.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.169
Keep the pedal down
and get the temperature up.

11:44.870 --> 11:45.870
But if this thing
blows up,

11:45.872 --> 11:49.040
A bulletproof vehicle
with a reinforced cage.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.376
Still, you're up front so you'll
take the brunt of the force,

11:51.378 --> 11:54.312
So I suggest you get down now.
(grunts)

11:54.314 --> 11:54.979
(grunts)

11:59.318 --> 12:01.886
(grunting)

12:01.888 --> 12:03.955
(groans)

12:04.890 --> 12:06.224
Come on. Let's go.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.259
Come on.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.862
(coughing)

12:10.864 --> 12:12.964
Meet us at end of
the 6th street bridge!

12:12.966 --> 12:15.033
Comin' up on it now.

12:15.035 --> 12:18.770
(tires screech)

12:23.743 --> 12:26.211
Five blocks from the courthouse
and the dl was already on us.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.746
The route was classified.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.881
We maximized security
at the weakest points.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.517
We had less than a .1% chance
of failure.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.186
It was a mole, someone inside
the lapd or the marshals.

12:35.188 --> 12:39.224
Those bastards have their finger
in every pie you can imagine.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.825
Wouldn't be the first time
that law enforcement

12:40.827 --> 12:42.527
Took a payout from scumbags.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.196
So now we're on our own.
No convoy. No backup.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.264
No chance in hell.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.466
No. No, I said
we'd protect maya,

12:48.468 --> 12:51.803
So we will. We just need
to readjust our plan.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.906
We're gonna have to
get her back ourselves.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.275
Hector will spot this
government suv in a second.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.877
I'm gonna have to get
a new vehicle.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.379
There's an earl's used car lot
not far from here.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.816
When I'm done with earl, he is
not gonna know what hit him.

13:04.818 --> 13:07.152
Look,

13:07.154 --> 13:09.020
This is clearly
a government vehicle,

13:09.022 --> 13:10.855
Not in any of your names.

13:10.857 --> 13:12.323
Hotter than the devil's armpit.

13:12.325 --> 13:15.460
You want to make this swap,
you got to throw in some cash.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.196
It needs brakes, brake liners,
shocks, new transmission,

13:18.198 --> 13:20.098
And the engine's
barely an engine.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.432
Got to buy the last vehicle

13:21.434 --> 13:23.334
They'd ever expect
to find us in.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.936
Okay, earl, let me guess.

13:24.938 --> 13:27.105
You're thrice divorced.
Four to six kids.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.973
One bad knee
and two blocked arteries.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.909
How do you...
It's a gift
I have.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.844
You had a woman
you cared about once,

13:32.846 --> 13:35.046
Hence that 1968-era necklace
around your neck--

13:35.048 --> 13:36.548
Clearly a gift from her.

13:36.550 --> 13:39.884
Now you wish you could do things
over and take away that hurt

13:39.886 --> 13:41.319
You caused her.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.087
Throw in cash

13:43.089 --> 13:44.322
Or no deal.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.057
Earl, you haven't had
a full bank account

13:46.059 --> 13:47.192
Or a decent bm in years.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.459
You're overplaying your hand

13:48.461 --> 13:52.897
But the truth is we're
just desperate enough to trade

13:52.899 --> 13:57.068
A $40,000 car for a $2,000 piece
of crap. You do that,

13:57.070 --> 13:58.903
You can belly up to the bar
with a fat wallet

13:58.905 --> 14:00.905
To impress
the ladies.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.373
You've been lonely for a while,
earl.

14:02.375 --> 14:05.276
It's about time you feel good
about yourself again. Hmm?

14:08.314 --> 14:10.381
â™ª

14:12.918 --> 14:14.919
Cabe:
<i>I feel like we should be</i>
<i>cranking some skynyrd</i>

14:14.921 --> 14:16.087
<i>In this thing.</i>

14:16.089 --> 14:18.022
Takes me back.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.023
To what?

14:19.025 --> 14:20.425
The '70s.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.427
I wasn't born yet.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.429
Screw you.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.097
You okay?

14:26.099 --> 14:28.967
I'm on the run with a bunch
of geeks in a conversion van

14:28.969 --> 14:31.269
That smells
like a dog dipped in soup.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.938
You just seem a little flushed.

14:33.940 --> 14:37.475
(scoffs)
we didn't.
Hector doesn't give up.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.277
And odds are overwhelming
that we won't outrun him

14:39.279 --> 14:40.445
In this vehicle.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.046
They have cars from this decade,

14:42.048 --> 14:44.115
Not to mention
semiautomatic weapons.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.950
I heard over
the comms,

14:45.952 --> 14:48.419
They got 44 rounds off
in a matter of seconds.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.588
48 rounds. I heard them ricochet
off the hood.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.259
Well, uh,

14:54.261 --> 14:56.494
Since we have a-a break
from action,

14:56.496 --> 14:57.495
Walter wanted me to talk to you.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.630
Nothing to talk about.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.632
The doc is dead to me.
I know

15:00.634 --> 15:04.168
You probably feel like people
let you down your whole life.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.537
But I-I think you should give
toby another chance.

15:06.539 --> 15:10.675
I guarantee that's not what
walter wanted you to say to me.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.277
He wants you to get along,
and I think you can.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.078
As more than friends.
It's just gonna take time

15:14.080 --> 15:17.015
Because you're...
Both different.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.516
Unique.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.119
Odd. Weird.

15:24.523 --> 15:26.524
I'm dust, aren't I?

15:26.526 --> 15:28.927
Pretty much.

15:30.162 --> 15:32.430
Damn it. We're overheating.

15:38.003 --> 15:40.672
Our man on the inside
has maya on the road

15:40.674 --> 15:42.340
With something
called scorpions.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.474
The band?

15:43.476 --> 15:45.176
Nerds.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.980
Whoever they are, we'll find
them and smoke them, too.

15:48.982 --> 15:52.350
Maybe sooner
than we think.

15:59.059 --> 16:03.194
Owned by a family that just
puttered around town in it.

16:04.196 --> 16:06.164
We know
who owned the car.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.532
Now we need to know
which way they went

16:07.534 --> 16:10.268
And what they were driving.

16:12.538 --> 16:14.472
A piece of crap.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.174
Great pick, doc.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.542
We needed a ride that would
keep us under the radar.

16:17.544 --> 16:18.743
We under the radar now?

16:18.745 --> 16:20.244
Out in the open
with a smoking van?

16:20.246 --> 16:21.646
They're not looking
for a van.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.381
They're looking for an suv.
And you're the mechanic.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.049
You should've figured out
this thing was a dud.

16:25.051 --> 16:26.985
Cut it out. Both of you.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.987
I thought you were gonna fix
things with them.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.588
It's a work in progress.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.257
Gonna need some coolant
and a new radiator hose.

16:33.259 --> 16:35.059
All right, kids.
If you need to hit the head,

16:35.061 --> 16:37.061
Now's the time because we're not
stopping once we hit the road.

16:37.063 --> 16:39.564
You know you're not our dad,
right?

16:39.566 --> 16:42.500
Stop acting like kids,
I'll stop acting like your dad.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.069
â™ª
(bell dinging)

16:46.171 --> 16:48.172
Bathroom?

16:48.174 --> 16:49.707
Man:
Through the back.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.310
Excuse me. Do you carry
the yogurt boysenberry blast

16:52.312 --> 16:54.712
But fresh?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.122
So you like salty sweet.

17:04.124 --> 17:06.057
I liked that, too,
when I was pregnant.

17:08.193 --> 17:10.661
The cravings,
plus your clothes not fitting.

17:10.663 --> 17:14.265
Let me guess,
end of first trimester?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.433
11 weeks.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.435
It's great.
My child gets to be born

17:17.437 --> 17:19.370
With a target on his back.

17:19.372 --> 17:21.072
You really don't think

17:21.074 --> 17:23.341
The government can protect you
from hector after you testify?

17:23.343 --> 17:25.610
I don't think
you guys can even protect me

17:25.612 --> 17:27.678
The rest of the way to ventura.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.753
â™ª

17:39.625 --> 17:42.060
(dinging)

17:42.528 --> 17:43.194
Cabe!

17:47.800 --> 17:51.536
(gunshots)

17:51.538 --> 17:52.703
Oh!

17:52.705 --> 17:55.339
(grunting)

17:55.341 --> 17:57.341
Hector:
Get the girl!

17:57.343 --> 17:59.410
(gunshots continue)
over here, over here.

18:10.322 --> 18:13.658
Ladies.

18:13.660 --> 18:17.261
I only want one of you.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.465
But I'll kill all three of you.

18:22.334 --> 18:23.601
We need to get
this van running.

18:23.603 --> 18:24.735
The hoses and the
coolant are inside.

18:24.737 --> 18:25.803
That's not really
an option right now.

18:25.805 --> 18:26.804
I'll take care of the hose.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.339
You find
a temporary coolant, okay?

18:28.341 --> 18:29.807
(grunts)

18:29.809 --> 18:32.110
(gunshots)

18:35.347 --> 18:36.681
Okay. I have an idea.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.616
I need this, uh, co2 canister,
but I also need

18:38.618 --> 18:42.453
A-a pvc pipe and some kind
of small, hard object.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.388
Top of the aisle. Paper towels
are on the second shelf,

18:44.390 --> 18:46.457
Six and a half feet away from
the cookie rack. Urinal cakes

18:46.459 --> 18:48.626
Are on the third shelf
just below the arthritis cream.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.829
Maya, I'll go. Happy,
work on the canister.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.398
(gunshots continue)

19:23.729 --> 19:27.365
You don't cross the dl.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.737
(grunts)

19:32.739 --> 19:34.839
(gunshots continue)

19:37.242 --> 19:38.910
Aha!

19:38.912 --> 19:40.178
Huh?

19:40.180 --> 19:41.812
Beer, toby?

19:41.814 --> 19:43.447
It's malt liquor.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.349
All right.
That's good.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.852
(gunshots)

19:50.289 --> 19:52.757
(clicking)

20:00.199 --> 20:03.367
I know what that sound is.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.570
You're as good as dead.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.443
Ladies, get in the van!

20:13.512 --> 20:15.780
Actually, not the first time
I've said that.

20:18.483 --> 20:20.384
Come on! Let's go!

20:20.386 --> 20:21.519
All right, hold on, guys.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.293
(backfiring)

20:34.866 --> 20:35.900
Sylvester:
<i>We got to hurry,</i>
<i>that was close.</i>

20:35.902 --> 20:38.302
Um... What's that new smell

20:38.304 --> 20:39.503
Coming from the vent?

20:39.505 --> 20:41.539
40 ounces of smooth,
satisfying flavor.

20:41.541 --> 20:43.441
And they're going to be back
in a few seconds with more guys

20:43.443 --> 20:44.842
And we're dead.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.677
I know a way out of this--
you can just let me go.

20:46.679 --> 20:47.878
I'll just disappear.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.447
You'll have no protection.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.881
Oh, as opposed to now?

20:50.883 --> 20:54.585
That are both a 16th inch
from being totally bald?

20:56.888 --> 20:58.489
Okay, that's it,
you are not normal.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.958
Who besides these guys computes
tire tread on wheels

21:00.960 --> 21:02.860
They've seen a split second?

21:02.862 --> 21:04.629
And you knew to the inch
where the supplies would be

21:04.631 --> 21:05.930
For my urinal cake cannon?

21:05.932 --> 21:08.933
You corrected me on the amount
of the bullets fired

21:08.935 --> 21:10.935
By hector and jorge,
and no one corrects me

21:10.937 --> 21:12.870
When it comes to math,
but you were right.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.905
I'm good with numbers.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.741
When you watch a pinwheel,
can you replay it in your mind

21:16.743 --> 21:19.610
In slow motion
to count the revolutions?

21:19.612 --> 21:20.845
Only when I'm bored.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.980
Yeah, you're a genius.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.615
I'm guessing 164,

21:24.617 --> 21:26.951
With a specialty in visual
inferential mathematics.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.787
You can record and compute
what you see.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.422
Now that explains the low eq.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.923
What the hell is a low eq?

21:32.925 --> 21:34.625
That.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.861
Okay, well,
I can take care of myself.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.964
You think being on the run
will be good for your pregnancy?

21:39.966 --> 21:41.299
Cabe:
You're pregnant?

21:41.301 --> 21:42.967
Oh, boy.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.336
We are averaging
70 miles per hour

21:45.338 --> 21:48.372
And the goons are gaining
on us at at least a hundred.

21:48.374 --> 21:49.874
We'd need a racecar.

21:49.876 --> 21:53.878
Actually, I-I know a place near
here where we could get one.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.919
Paige:
Who owns this place?

22:01.921 --> 22:03.554
Guy named ricky lambert.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.890
He's a hacker who does contract
work for the dl.

22:05.892 --> 22:08.025
He hacks into government
databases

22:08.027 --> 22:09.827
And then he makes fake ids
and passports

22:09.829 --> 22:11.996
So they can smuggle contraband
overseas.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.831
Pays better than
what we're doing.

22:13.833 --> 22:14.965
Actually, he's broke.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.068
He had to take
a loan out from the dl.

22:17.070 --> 22:19.403
Dude likes to blow his money
on bad habits.

22:19.405 --> 22:21.038
I wouldn't know anything
about that.

22:21.040 --> 22:23.007
Walter:
Lamborghini aventador lp 700?

22:23.009 --> 22:25.343
It's great.
We'd only need four of them.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.744
What about that?

22:26.746 --> 22:30.514
That's a top-of-the-line,
655-horsepower, diesel rv.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.817
With the latest
in smart car tech,

22:32.819 --> 22:35.853
Including digital load
balancing, four-wheel braking.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.888
We could modify the onboard
computer to maximize speed.

22:37.890 --> 22:41.892
With that, we could outrun
the dl and get maya to safety.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.928
Again, being forced
to testify against the dl

22:43.930 --> 22:45.863
Is not returning me to safety.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.132
For now, we just gotta make sure
the dl doesn't catch up to us.

22:48.134 --> 22:49.667
Security's tight.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.603
It'd be tough to sneak through.

22:52.605 --> 22:53.904
Don't even try.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.039
Lambert likes to use his muscle.

22:55.041 --> 22:57.074
He likes to pretend he's hector.

22:57.076 --> 23:00.378
Problem is, we don't have
any muscle of our own.

23:00.380 --> 23:03.080
Yeah, but lambert
doesn't know that.

23:04.049 --> 23:05.750
Man:
Mr. Lambert.

23:05.752 --> 23:07.852
These men claim
to have business with you.

23:07.854 --> 23:12.690
Well, the organizations
who hire me call me mr. Green.

23:12.692 --> 23:14.525
This is my associate.

23:14.527 --> 23:15.960
Afternoon.

23:15.962 --> 23:18.396
I've come on behalf
of hector menjivar.

23:18.398 --> 23:19.630
I believe you know him.

23:19.632 --> 23:21.632
He's someone you owe
in a substantial way.

23:21.634 --> 23:24.034
I suggest you invite us in.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.503
Yeah, sure thing.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.037
Yeah, I don't want any trouble.

23:27.039 --> 23:28.973
Thank you.

23:28.975 --> 23:32.009
<i>According to our information,</i>
<i>mr. Lambert,</i>

23:32.011 --> 23:33.744
You owe hector
a quarter million dollars

23:33.746 --> 23:35.713
And he doesn't believe...
What? No.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.915
No. I don't owe him
anywhere near that.

23:39.718 --> 23:42.887
Allow me to refresh your memory.

23:42.889 --> 23:44.855
Maya:
<i>You borrowed $170,000</i>

23:44.857 --> 23:47.091
At 19 points, which bumped up
to 20 points after six months.

23:47.093 --> 23:51.629
After compounding interest,
you owe $252,187.63.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.431
Sly, I think
you've met your match.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.565
Walter (over comm):
After compounding interest,

23:54.567 --> 24:00.471
You owe $252,187.63.

24:00.473 --> 24:02.139
So, did I...

24:02.141 --> 24:03.908
Did I miss anything?

24:03.910 --> 24:05.075
No.

24:05.077 --> 24:08.579
Means you were right.
Seal the deal; intimidate him.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.748
Tell him you want the money now.
I want the money now.

24:10.750 --> 24:11.982
What?

24:11.984 --> 24:13.818
Tell him he wouldn't want
to make you angry.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.153
You wouldn't want me
to get angry.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.988
Tell him he wouldn't like you
when your angry.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.190
Okay, what is he, the hulk?

24:19.192 --> 24:21.125
You wouldn't like me
when I'm angry,

24:21.127 --> 24:23.994
Because my adrenal cortex
releases stress hormones,

24:23.996 --> 24:25.996
I become irritable

24:25.998 --> 24:27.097
And I might possibly even

24:27.099 --> 24:28.866
Raise my voice.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.701
Nevermind, just slam the table.

24:30.703 --> 24:31.869
(slams table)

24:32.971 --> 24:35.005
Come on, walt, harder!

24:35.007 --> 24:37.041
(grunts)

24:38.477 --> 24:40.077
Is this guy crazy?

24:40.079 --> 24:42.880
You have no idea.

24:42.882 --> 24:45.149
Now, hector told me
to leave here

24:45.151 --> 24:48.018
With either collateral,
or your left hand,

24:48.020 --> 24:51.689
So which one is going to be?

25:02.067 --> 25:03.634
Close the door.

25:03.636 --> 25:05.636
We got to get out of here
before he catches on.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.071
All right, done.
Let's go.

25:07.073 --> 25:09.139
Hector, it's lambert.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.608
Look, I want you to know
I wasn't...

25:10.610 --> 25:12.142
I wasn't trying
to dodge my debt. Okay?

25:12.144 --> 25:14.245
Your guys are on their way
with my rv now.

25:14.247 --> 25:16.113
I'll get you the rest
in a week.

25:16.115 --> 25:18.082
The hell are you talking about?

25:18.084 --> 25:20.150
Hurry up.
It's hard to see behind you
in this thing.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.821
I think I hit one of the rocks.

25:23.823 --> 25:25.256
All right, floor it.

25:25.258 --> 25:26.657
(tires squealing)

25:26.659 --> 25:28.993
Come on.
Come on!

25:28.995 --> 25:30.961
(grunts)
(tires squealing)

25:30.963 --> 25:32.530
What is that noise?

25:35.767 --> 25:37.101
We gotta move, cabe.
Come on.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.869
I can't! We're stuck!

25:44.009 --> 25:46.076
(tires squealing)
come on.

25:46.912 --> 25:48.879
Open the gates.

25:49.848 --> 25:50.981
All right, okay, okay.

25:58.056 --> 25:59.990
(gunshots)

26:00.725 --> 26:01.926
Okay, close the gates.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.127
Mm, got it.

26:03.129 --> 26:04.562
Happy, where are you?

26:04.564 --> 26:05.996
(tires squealing)

26:10.669 --> 26:12.603
Come on, come on, let's go.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.239
Oh, oh, no.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.274
Come on, come on, come on.

26:17.276 --> 26:19.577
What are you doing?

26:19.579 --> 26:21.245
I'm making it so
they can't follow us!

26:21.247 --> 26:22.680
(gunfire)
open the gate now!

26:32.791 --> 26:33.991
Everybody okay?

26:33.993 --> 26:36.694
I dropped my yogurt
when we were running, so no.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.929
This guy has a lot of toys.

26:40.899 --> 26:43.167
What about you, maya?

26:43.169 --> 26:45.002
You all right?

26:45.004 --> 26:47.037
No.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.807
This is never going to end.

26:49.809 --> 26:51.976
I know that agent gallo thinks

26:51.978 --> 26:56.747
But you see now the fear that
hector strikes into people.

26:56.749 --> 26:59.717
Just the idea
that he was angry

26:59.719 --> 27:01.719
Got lambert to hand over
a luxury rv.

27:01.721 --> 27:05.356
He has people who don't even
work for him, shooting at us.

27:05.358 --> 27:07.658
I mean, people kill for him.

27:07.660 --> 27:11.362
And after I testify,
he will kill me.

27:11.364 --> 27:13.063
And my child.

27:13.065 --> 27:15.866
I get it,
but what are we going to do?

27:15.868 --> 27:19.003
The feds want her to testify
or do time for refusing.

27:19.005 --> 27:20.270
They need her.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.206
There's nothing
we can do about it.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.808
I don't like it
any more than you guys.

27:28.747 --> 27:30.848
What if they didn't need her?

27:30.850 --> 27:32.049
They're building a case, walter.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.283
She's their evidence.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.419
She knows their books,
their operation.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.021
She was their bookkeeper
for years.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.156
What if we can create
the books.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.424
Books that maya
has the information for.

27:40.426 --> 27:41.925
Toby:
We all heard her back there.

27:41.927 --> 27:43.894
She knows every detail
of their operation

27:43.896 --> 27:45.362
Down to the last penny.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.931
We create a computerized diary
of all the dl's dealings.

27:47.933 --> 27:49.900
We just need to make it look

27:49.902 --> 27:51.935
Like it was created
a couple years ago

27:51.937 --> 27:54.071
With digital imprints
that even the best forensics

27:54.073 --> 27:56.707
Won't be able to tell are fake.

27:56.709 --> 27:57.775
If it contains everything
in maya's head,

27:57.777 --> 27:59.443
Then the feds don't need maya

27:59.445 --> 28:02.046
And hector and his pals
still go up the river.

28:02.048 --> 28:03.213
Can you guys really do that?

28:03.215 --> 28:04.448
Yes.
No.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.184
That's fabricating evidence.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.687
The feds want her on the stand,
under oath.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.055
Um, maya.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.790
Do you swear everything
you're going to tell us

28:12.792 --> 28:14.792
Will be the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth?

28:14.794 --> 28:16.226
I do.
That works for me.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.761
That's a dirty magazine.

28:17.763 --> 28:18.862
Yes, it is.

28:19.731 --> 28:21.465
It's revolting.

28:21.467 --> 28:24.435
So if you're just going
to shoot this down,

28:24.437 --> 28:26.470
Then I hope you have
another plan to save maya.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.806
(sighs)

28:28.808 --> 28:30.274
Happy, take the wheel.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.743
I need to make this
as legal as possible.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.478
Lambert:
<i>Hector. Look, hector,</i>
<i>if I knew who they were,</i>

28:34.480 --> 28:35.979
I would've killed them on site.

28:35.981 --> 28:37.181
Okay, please.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.415
I thought they
were with you.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.850
And I thought you were
someone who was smart.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.752
You take your time
paying me back,

28:41.754 --> 28:43.187
Now you let a bunch
of computer nerds

28:43.189 --> 28:44.421
Slip right through your fingers.

28:44.423 --> 28:45.823
Computers.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.491
That's it.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.126
We got 'em.

28:54.132 --> 28:56.767
And the phony alcohol stamp
business netted 128?

28:56.769 --> 28:59.803
$128,040.12 in
September of 2008.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.305
Sylvester:
In one month? All right.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.940
What's the next entry?

29:02.942 --> 29:04.908
Hey.
Hey.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.243
Can I tell you a story?

29:06.245 --> 29:08.078
I'm driving a 30,000
pound vehicle.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.080
I am focused on the road.

29:10.082 --> 29:12.082
I'll be quick.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.485
When your mom is bipolar

29:14.487 --> 29:17.121
And your dad is so passive
that he sometimes doesn't talk

29:17.123 --> 29:19.823
To his son for weeks on end,
not because he's mad at you

29:19.825 --> 29:21.425
But because he forgets
you're there,

29:21.427 --> 29:23.861
You grow up with nothing good,

29:23.863 --> 29:26.797
And you begin to think
you deserve nothing good.

29:26.799 --> 29:29.933
So when something good
is right in front of you,

29:29.935 --> 29:32.803
Or next to you,
you self-sabotage

29:32.805 --> 29:34.404
Because you wouldn't know
what to do

29:34.406 --> 29:36.140
With something good
if you had it.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.808
I'm truly sorry, happy.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.042
I didn't mean to hurt you.

29:39.044 --> 29:42.312
I have worn perfume
once in my life.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.114
Last night.

29:44.116 --> 29:47.151
And I won't do it again.

29:47.153 --> 29:50.220
Look, last
night saved us

29:50.222 --> 29:52.055
A year of nonsense
that would've resulted

29:52.057 --> 29:53.891
In us not
being friends.

29:53.893 --> 29:57.194
It's better this way.
Going back to normal.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.929
I think it can still work.

30:00.866 --> 30:05.502
Yeah, we all
have problems, happy.
No, we have serious problems.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.070
Who doesn't have serious
problems, you know?

30:07.072 --> 30:08.338
That's what makes us human.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.174
No, idiot. I'm not
in control of the rv.

30:10.176 --> 30:12.042
Someone's hacked
into the onboard

30:12.044 --> 30:14.244
Computer and taken
control of this rig.

30:14.246 --> 30:17.147
I have complete autonomy
over the vehicle.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.116
There's nothing they can do.

30:20.885 --> 30:22.886
Oh, man, we're still
accelerating.

30:25.190 --> 30:27.357
Pull the emergency brake.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.459
Uh, nothing. They cut
the power steering.

30:29.461 --> 30:32.396
Okay, I've basically got no
control of a 15-ton vehicle.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.565
We're screwed.
Hector must have
lambert doing this.

30:34.567 --> 30:36.834
I'm buckling up.

30:36.836 --> 30:38.836
Happy:
<i>I can barely keep this thing</i>
<i>on the road.</i>

30:38.838 --> 30:41.939
Lambert:
I'm burying the needle
on these guys.

30:41.941 --> 30:43.874
Someone grab the wheel.
I've got it.

30:43.876 --> 30:45.275
According
to the navigation system,

30:45.277 --> 30:47.277
We're coming to
a three and a half-mile

30:47.279 --> 30:49.012
Straightaway,
ending in a sharp turn and a

30:49.014 --> 30:51.481
Steep drop off. At this speed
we won't make that turn.

30:53.985 --> 30:55.285
Sylvester:
<i>That gives us</i>

30:55.287 --> 30:57.154
Two minutes and 38 seconds
until we drive off

30:57.156 --> 31:00.524
Of the cliff.
Yeah, not if we regain control
of the onboard computer.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.894
Ah, he cut off the wireless.
I can't hack in.

31:03.896 --> 31:06.029
We have to manually
access it. Happy,

31:06.031 --> 31:07.397
Can you get it
through the dash?

31:07.399 --> 31:10.367
Not in two minutes.
But there's another way to it.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.469
And we are gonna
need this stuff.

31:15.173 --> 31:17.574
No more than
six feet of rope.

31:17.576 --> 31:24.882
I got it. Be careful.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.250
(grunts)

31:31.489 --> 31:33.257
If you're off
by more than 2 .9 inches,

31:33.259 --> 31:34.524
She'll get
sucked under the wheel.

31:34.526 --> 31:39.229
We got less than two miles,
then we're going over the cliff.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.474
Give me some slack.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.987
â™ª

32:15.700 --> 32:18.936
When we regain control,
paige, you steer us to

32:18.938 --> 32:21.038
The side of
the road.

32:26.411 --> 32:30.614
Be right back. Or not.

32:30.616 --> 32:33.083
A minute, 32 until impact.

32:40.525 --> 32:42.526
(grunts)

32:42.528 --> 32:44.194
What took you so long?

32:52.670 --> 32:55.238
Oh!
Uh, please tell me you did not

32:55.240 --> 32:56.606
Just drop the screwdriver.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.608
Okay, I won't.

32:58.610 --> 32:59.509
Try and think of something.

32:59.511 --> 33:00.610
I got it, I got it.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.746
Got it. Think I can reach

33:02.748 --> 33:04.014
The hard drive from there.

33:04.016 --> 33:05.449
Time to make
a little room for me.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.684
I'll see you up top. Or not.

33:19.197 --> 33:21.198
30 seconds.

33:37.248 --> 33:39.149
All right.

33:40.118 --> 33:41.618
Hi.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.086
15 seconds.

33:52.463 --> 33:53.497
Eight seconds!

33:58.669 --> 34:00.604
Oh, he shut down the computer!

34:00.606 --> 34:03.173
Cut the wheel.

34:07.111 --> 34:08.779
Oh.

34:18.423 --> 34:19.790
Walter.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.630
Oh, god, no,

34:26.632 --> 34:28.298
No.
What is it?

34:28.300 --> 34:30.767
That's the worst roadkill
I've ever seen.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.836
(grunts)
(coughs)

34:37.208 --> 34:40.777
Okay, we can celebrate our
near-death experience later.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.246
'cause hector... (coughs)
...Is still on our tail and

34:43.248 --> 34:46.083
It won't be much longer until
he catches up with us again.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.452
(coughs)
we kind of stand out

34:48.454 --> 34:50.520
In the middle of nowhere
farming country.

34:50.522 --> 34:52.522
That might not such a bad thing.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.258
What the hell does that mean?
I got an idea.

34:58.596 --> 35:02.599
This is federal agent
cabe gallo, badge number 2835.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.235
Get me the local
sheriff's office.

35:11.242 --> 35:12.576
<i>Vamano, jorge, vamano, vamano.</i>
<i>Come on,</i>

35:12.578 --> 35:14.744
<i>Come on, faster,</i>
<i>we got to catch 'em!</i>

35:14.746 --> 35:16.780
There they are.

35:20.284 --> 35:21.518
Gun it.

35:28.693 --> 35:31.528
Come on, around the side,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

35:38.202 --> 35:40.337
Get around 'em!

35:40.339 --> 35:43.406
I can't get past 'em.
I can't see ahead of 'em.

35:44.342 --> 35:46.176
Hit the brakes!

35:48.880 --> 35:50.814
Hands up. Don't move.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.816
You pull
that trigger

35:52.818 --> 35:55.385
And it'll be the last
thing you ever do.

36:05.663 --> 36:06.696
(grunts)

36:06.698 --> 36:10.200
Hey. Thanks for hacking the rv.

36:10.202 --> 36:13.270
Gave us the idea to operate it
remotely ourselves.

36:13.272 --> 36:15.305
Except it worked out
for us. Enjoy prison.

36:27.752 --> 36:29.786
Prosecutors
are gonna be pissed.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.821
Well, they won't
be too happy with me.

36:31.823 --> 36:34.324
But at the end of day,
with the data you gave us,

36:34.326 --> 36:37.394
They'll be able to make a rico
case and put hector and his boys

36:37.396 --> 36:39.896
Away for life.
That's all they care about,

36:39.898 --> 36:42.699
So they'll let it go.

36:42.701 --> 36:43.833
Well,

36:43.835 --> 36:45.468
Guess this is good-bye.

36:45.470 --> 36:47.737
Before you go, let me
hear it one more time,

36:47.739 --> 36:49.339
For my own piece of mind.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.941
After sheriff barnes
takes me to the bus station,

36:50.943 --> 36:53.210
I buy a ticket to vancouver.
Once I get there

36:53.212 --> 36:54.844
I go straight
to the u.S. Consulate,

36:54.846 --> 36:56.379
Request a package
from cabe gallo,

36:56.381 --> 36:58.515
And they'll hand it over to me,
no questions asked.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.584
That's right. Inside
you'll find 20 grand

37:00.586 --> 37:02.852
And a brand-new canadian
identity for you.

37:02.854 --> 37:03.954
Best of luck, kid.

37:03.956 --> 37:06.456
Why are you all
doing this for me?

37:06.458 --> 37:08.625
We promised to protect you.

37:08.627 --> 37:09.859
And you're one of us.

37:14.765 --> 37:16.433
(engine starts)

37:20.638 --> 37:24.507
A new country,
fake I.D.S...

37:24.509 --> 37:26.009
Not without
its risks.

37:26.011 --> 37:27.844
She's going to have a child.

37:27.846 --> 37:31.881
When it comes to someone you
love, you have to take risks.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.883
Do you hear that, pal?

37:33.885 --> 37:36.753
You got to take risks
when you love someone.

37:53.571 --> 37:55.305
Garcia: Authorities have
finally brought down

37:55.307 --> 37:58.408
The notorious leader
of the dl, hector menjivar.

37:58.410 --> 37:59.909
The break in the case
was the stunning discovery

37:59.911 --> 38:01.478
Of the dl's electronic

38:01.480 --> 38:04.814
Financial ledger, recovered
from menjivar's laptop.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.883
Members of his crew
are already cutting deals

38:06.885 --> 38:08.818
Implicating not only menjivar

38:08.820 --> 38:11.454
But a member of the lapd
who was allegedly

38:11.456 --> 38:14.624
Acting as a mole
for the criminal organization.

38:14.626 --> 38:16.760
You were right
about the mole, toby.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.828
Good night, guys.

38:18.830 --> 38:21.331
That was distant.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.732
That's 'cause she cares.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.467
If she didn't care,
she wouldn't be upset.

38:25.871 --> 38:29.406
Me? Nothing.
I'm not doing anything.

38:30.441 --> 38:31.775
Okay. So, I found another

38:31.777 --> 38:33.543
Boysenberry blast
in the back of the fridge

38:33.545 --> 38:36.713
And it is past due as well.

38:36.715 --> 38:37.881
Are you kidding me?

38:37.883 --> 38:39.683
You need to take a risk, son.

38:39.685 --> 38:42.052
You see what I did with
happy? I opened up.

38:42.054 --> 38:44.054
I wore my heart
on my sleeve.

38:44.056 --> 38:46.523
Toby. You were severely burned.

38:46.525 --> 38:49.826
Yes, but I'm living. And
I'm gonna get her back.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.728
Give me this.
Toby.

38:51.730 --> 38:54.097
Mmm, mmm, mmm, oh, my god.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.933
Oh, mmm. <i>Delicioso.</i>

38:56.935 --> 38:58.968
Mmm. It's fine,
you big baby.

38:58.970 --> 39:00.036
And because you
didn't take a risk,

39:00.038 --> 39:01.571
Someone else got your yogurt.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.642
(chuckles)

39:05.644 --> 39:09.546
If you don't take a risk, my
man, drew's gonna take paige.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.715
Paige isn't yogurt.

39:11.717 --> 39:13.783
No, she's a risk. One you
need to take. So you need

39:13.785 --> 39:15.885
To get in your car, drive to
her house, knock on her door

39:15.887 --> 39:17.954
And tell her how you feel.

39:31.001 --> 39:32.836
Thank you!

39:45.916 --> 39:47.984
â™ª
