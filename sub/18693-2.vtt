00:46.491 --> 00:48.412
- You broke the Accords.
- But I know you won't.

(VALENTINE PANTING)

01:16.702 --> 01:18.452
You set me up to
kill that vampire.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.234
You killed her because it
was the right thing to do.

that thing wreaking havoc.

01:25.637 --> 01:28.592

You're wrong.

01:57.916 --> 02:00.293

about your mother?

you don't know me at all.

02:06.268 --> 02:07.634
You saved my life.

02:07.635 --> 02:08.892
You could've
Portaled me anywhere,

02:08.893 --> 02:11.494
handed me over to the Clave in
Idris, but did you?

02:11.818 --> 02:15.064
No, because deep down inside,

02:15.618 --> 02:17.697
you know that I'm right.

02:26.158 --> 02:27.718

02:41.725 --> 02:43.608
What is wrong with you?
We almost had him back.

02:43.609 --> 02:45.335
- You don't understand.
- You're right, I don't.

02:45.336 --> 02:47.600
I don't understand why you
would try to kill my brother.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.837
Because your brother,
he's not who you think he is.

02:51.326 --> 02:53.190
Honey, there's still
so much you don't know.

02:53.191 --> 02:55.392
Oh, and whose fault is that?

02:55.870 --> 02:59.038
Everyone says that Valentine
is the monster, but you...

02:59.039 --> 03:01.693
you just tried to
murder your own son!

03:01.694 --> 03:05.073
Hey, maybe we should take
a deep breath and relax.

03:05.378 --> 03:09.135
Simon, give us some
space, please.

03:09.136 --> 03:12.080
- Sure thing, Mrs. F.
- No. No, you're not going anywhere.

03:12.105 --> 03:14.946
You're the only person
I can trust right now.

03:21.603 --> 03:25.794
I want you to know I'm
a victim here, too.

03:25.871 --> 03:27.509
We all are.

03:27.777 --> 03:29.472
When I was pregnant
with your brother,

03:29.473 --> 03:31.697
Valentine drugged me.

03:32.292 --> 03:34.671
He did an experiment
on the baby.

03:34.672 --> 03:35.742
What?

03:35.743 --> 03:39.494
He injected Jonathan
with demon blood.

03:42.628 --> 03:44.486
Why would he do that?

03:44.733 --> 03:46.322
He's sick.

03:46.996 --> 03:50.671
He thought demon blood would
make our unborn child strong.

03:50.672 --> 03:51.752
(SCOFFS)

03:51.753 --> 03:53.471
And it did.

03:54.410 --> 03:56.251
But it also made him...

03:57.489 --> 03:58.961
evil.

03:59.212 --> 04:01.708
No, even if that's true,
Downworlders have demon blood.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.017
They're not all bad.

04:03.018 --> 04:06.972
Clary, you have no idea how
much I loved your brother.

04:08.664 --> 04:10.775
He was my baby boy.

04:11.308 --> 04:14.232
And I didn't want to
believe it until I saw

04:14.233 --> 04:16.250
what he was capable of.

some pretty flowers. Okay.

04:37.265 --> 04:40.282
(GASPS) Oh. Oh, it's okay. Yeah.

04:51.373 --> 04:53.002
Jonathan!

04:58.074 --> 05:01.389
And it wasn't the last time
something like that happened.

05:01.936 --> 05:06.060
So I went to one of Idris' most
powerful warlocks, Ragnor Fell.

05:06.104 --> 05:07.993
He warned me that,
in the future,

05:07.994 --> 05:10.460
your brother would
only leave death

05:10.671 --> 05:13.138
and destruction in his wake.

Aldertree wants to
question me again.

05:37.566 --> 05:39.483
Why would he do that?
I don't know anything.

05:39.484 --> 05:42.044
Maybe he wants you to confirm
that my mother has lost her mind.

05:42.045 --> 05:44.323
Your mom is the
sanest person I know.

05:44.405 --> 05:46.115
Remember when she told
me it was a bad idea

05:46.116 --> 05:47.789
to get the Champagne
Enema tattoo?

05:47.790 --> 05:51.971
Or she warned you that Tommy
Peterson was a total assclown?

05:52.155 --> 05:54.201
So, you're saying that my
mom's right about this?

05:54.202 --> 05:58.685
That Jace... Jace is some kind
of evil flower-killing monster

05:58.686 --> 06:00.412
that deserves a death sentence?

06:00.413 --> 06:03.582
No, no. (CHUCKLES) That's
definitely not what I'm saying.

06:03.583 --> 06:05.453
But we did see what
Jace did to that vampire

06:05.454 --> 06:08.009
before he grabbed Valentine
and then disappeared.

06:38.206 --> 06:40.191
Yes. Completely disgusting.

06:40.192 --> 06:43.297
I mean, ridiculously unsanitary.
Who does that?

06:43.298 --> 06:45.336

you to find out.

You'll find a way.

you convince me...

08:07.269 --> 08:08.612

know, Jace is gone.

Nobody told me.

09:53.695 --> 09:54.921
That wasn't an accident.

when they try to abduct them.

we have a shot at Valentine.

12:40.991 --> 12:42.850
You have me.

12:43.895 --> 12:45.787
And that's not gonna change.

12:55.734 --> 12:58.527
Half a dozen people
disappear into thin air.

12:58.552 --> 13:00.803
What's this,
the freaking Rapture?

13:00.804 --> 13:03.969
- Where'd they go?
- That's what we plan to find out.

13:04.695 --> 13:06.792
Should we call the warlock?
Do some memory wipes?

13:06.817 --> 13:08.328
Normally I would, but...

13:08.329 --> 13:11.053
better to let the word spread,
keep people safe at home.

13:11.078 --> 13:12.989
Guess you know what's best.

13:13.014 --> 13:14.158
We got a problem?

13:14.183 --> 13:16.445
The pack wants to know how long you're
gonna let your little vamp friend

13:16.469 --> 13:18.038
hang out in werewolf territory.

13:18.063 --> 13:19.203
We're not a bed and breakfast.

13:19.227 --> 13:21.233
Well, I didn't say
make the kid pancakes.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.061
Look, the boy's going
through a rough time.

13:23.086 --> 13:25.578
Much like you were when you first
turned and came to me for help.

13:25.602 --> 13:27.296
Or have you forgotten?

13:28.106 --> 13:30.780
Good.
Then we're on the same page.

13:35.822 --> 13:37.122
GRETEL: Hey!

13:37.327 --> 13:39.170
What are you doing back here?

13:39.682 --> 13:42.190
- We thought maybe you'd moved out.
- Trust me, I want to.

13:42.215 --> 13:45.111
It's just... I'm still trying to
figure out this whole vampire thing

13:45.149 --> 13:47.751
and Luke says I should
remain among Downworlders...

13:47.776 --> 13:49.885
You're not gonna figure anything out.
Look at you.

13:49.886 --> 13:51.395
You're an embarrassment
to your own kind.

13:51.396 --> 13:53.335
Why are you so angry?
Is it the fleas or the ticks?

13:53.359 --> 13:54.659
- (WEREWOLVES GROWL)
- Wait.

13:54.684 --> 13:56.901
Pack leader gave orders.

13:58.149 --> 14:02.180
Look, you and us,
we're all dealing with the same old crap.

14:02.205 --> 14:04.672
Doomed to spend our lives
hiding in the shadows.

14:04.673 --> 14:06.508
For you, literally the shadows.

14:06.533 --> 14:10.344
So, do me a favor and
stay out of my sight.

14:13.668 --> 14:15.836
SIMON: Doomed? I'm not doomed.

14:25.860 --> 14:27.234
(GASPS)

14:27.259 --> 14:29.202
Hey, bud. <i>Como estas?</i>

14:29.226 --> 14:30.778
Raphael, <i>amigo!</i>

14:30.803 --> 14:32.936
(STAMMERS) Can I get
you a pint of O-neg?

14:32.961 --> 14:35.772
Explain to me why you
told Victor Aldertree

14:35.797 --> 14:38.298
I'm responsible for a
vampire den in Flatbush.

14:38.330 --> 14:40.373
No, I didn't say that.
I said that those decisions

14:40.398 --> 14:41.709
are way above my pay grade,

14:41.734 --> 14:43.906
that they come from guys
at the top like you.

14:43.931 --> 14:47.408
Now, saying it back, I can see
how they came to that conclusion.

14:47.433 --> 14:50.073
- That was one of Camille's dens.
- I thought that was Maria's den.

14:50.097 --> 14:52.336
Camille turned
Maria, too, genius.

14:52.361 --> 14:53.803
And now, because of you,

14:53.805 --> 14:55.900
I'm being called in
to answer for it.

14:56.103 --> 14:58.204
Do you have any idea
what the Clave does

14:58.229 --> 15:00.757
to vampires who
violate the Accords?

15:00.782 --> 15:01.915
I'm not sure I want to know.
(CHUCKLES)

15:01.939 --> 15:03.758
They nail us to crosses,

15:03.783 --> 15:06.515
then let shafts of sunlight
burn off our body parts,

15:06.540 --> 15:07.836
one at a time.

15:08.138 --> 15:09.438
Which body part?

15:10.005 --> 15:11.784
You know what?
Don't answer that.

15:11.809 --> 15:13.024
I can probably talk to Clary.

15:13.049 --> 15:14.977
No, you're gonna find Camille...

15:16.093 --> 15:17.698
and bring her back
to the Hotel DuMort.

15:17.755 --> 15:18.961
What? Why me?

15:18.986 --> 15:21.391
Because you and your friends
are the ones who let her out.

15:21.416 --> 15:23.100
She's your sire.

15:23.125 --> 15:26.461
Use your connection to
her, or die trying.

15:33.223 --> 15:35.727
- (PRISONERS CLAMORING)
- (CAGES RATTLING)

15:49.849 --> 15:52.919
If you're thinking of
trying to escape, don't.

15:53.354 --> 15:55.734
The wards around this ship
would fry you like an egg.

15:56.693 --> 15:57.880
I want to be here.

15:57.905 --> 16:00.065
I can't wait to get out and
start killing Downworlders.

16:00.089 --> 16:03.451
Trust me.
It's not as glorious as you think.

16:03.733 --> 16:05.499
Screw glory.

16:05.524 --> 16:06.772
I want justice.

16:06.797 --> 16:09.225
I lost my father 'cause
of these monsters.

16:09.468 --> 16:10.508
I'm sorry.

16:10.533 --> 16:11.899
Valentine said if the
Clave did their job,

16:11.923 --> 16:13.071
he'd still be alive right now.

16:13.095 --> 16:14.395
Valentine...

16:15.853 --> 16:17.737
I see you've met Jeremy.

16:17.762 --> 16:20.346
The others are gearing up for tonight's
mission. You should get ready.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.729
- Mission?
- Part of our first phase.

16:22.754 --> 16:24.214
While we're
increasing in numbers,

16:24.239 --> 16:27.307
we're also finding suitable
Downworlders to hold on to for research.

16:27.332 --> 16:30.253
You should join them.
They could use a good leader like you.

16:30.599 --> 16:33.376
I don't lead hunts for
innocent Downworlders.

16:33.401 --> 16:36.115
Innocent? Like that vamp,
Maria, who almost killed you?

16:36.217 --> 16:37.529
Don't be naive, Jonathan.

16:37.554 --> 16:40.279
See, you were trained to see
Downworlders as your allies

16:40.304 --> 16:42.708
and that I'm your worst enemy.

16:43.330 --> 16:45.993
But I'm not asking
you to do this for me.

16:46.018 --> 16:47.915
I'm asking for humanity.

16:49.601 --> 16:50.901
The answer's no.

16:54.383 --> 16:56.091
He just doesn't get it, does he?

16:56.116 --> 16:58.716
Not yet, but he will.

16:59.922 --> 17:02.146
There's one person who I know,

17:02.444 --> 17:04.340
who can convince him.

17:13.974 --> 17:15.559
Clary?

17:15.642 --> 17:18.169
I made you black coffee
with lots of sugar.

17:18.194 --> 17:21.128
It's not as good as Java
Jones, but it'll do.

17:23.762 --> 17:25.061
Clary?

17:30.764 --> 17:32.174
Oh, no.

17:57.397 --> 17:59.844
He said the best fighters
in the city come here.

17:59.882 --> 18:03.108
It's only a matter of time
before Valentine hits this place.

18:18.825 --> 18:21.247
- You got some moves.
- Yeah?

18:21.272 --> 18:23.459
How about I take you home and
show you some of those moves,

18:23.483 --> 18:25.122
up close and personal?

18:25.147 --> 18:26.675
That's funny.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.342
You really think you
have a chance with her?

18:28.366 --> 18:29.504
And who are you?

18:29.529 --> 18:31.708
I'm the guy who's gonna put you
down if you don't shut your mouth.

18:31.732 --> 18:33.338
Why don't you come up and
try, pretty boy?

18:33.362 --> 18:34.818
I got this.

18:37.479 --> 18:39.899
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

18:40.873 --> 18:44.040
I don't fight girls,
especially hot ones.

18:44.697 --> 18:47.126
Then I guess it's gonna
be really one-sided.

18:59.365 --> 19:01.458
Still want to take me home?

19:13.195 --> 19:16.255
You didn't tell me Portal travel
was gonna make me wanna barf.

19:19.343 --> 19:20.643
You'll get used to it.

19:21.030 --> 19:22.514
Hopefully sooner than later.

19:22.548 --> 19:24.038
So, what's the emergency?

19:24.063 --> 19:25.913
I need help tracking
down your friend Camille.

19:25.938 --> 19:28.024
You're the only one I know who
knows her as well as Raphael.

19:28.048 --> 19:29.913
I know her better, in fact,

19:29.938 --> 19:33.773
which also means I know how stupid
it is to go looking for her.

19:33.820 --> 19:36.183
I know she could be holding a
grudge about the whole blackmail...

19:36.207 --> 19:37.374
Could be?

19:37.399 --> 19:39.842
Camille's absolute favorite
thing is holding grudges.

19:40.173 --> 19:42.766
I forgot her 607th birthday,
which isn't even...

19:42.767 --> 19:45.161
I could forget about my 19th
birthday if we don't find her.

19:45.743 --> 19:46.970
So, please,

19:46.995 --> 19:50.821
can you take a break from your
day job and help a vamp out?

19:51.759 --> 19:55.187
Lucky for you, this potion
will take a few hours to stew.

19:55.780 --> 19:57.768
But it'll cost you.

19:58.277 --> 19:59.577
Okay.

20:00.453 --> 20:01.721
Hey!

20:02.798 --> 20:03.998
Mmm.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.839
- I've been running low.
- Hmm.

20:08.898 --> 20:10.527
A chick did that to you?

20:10.552 --> 20:12.418
Yeah, I'd like to see
you fight that chick.

20:12.443 --> 20:14.167
Break you like a twig.

20:14.201 --> 20:15.501
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLES)

20:20.740 --> 20:22.320
(GRUNTS)

20:31.768 --> 20:33.381
Tell us where Valentine is.

20:33.998 --> 20:35.470
Where is he?

20:39.584 --> 20:40.884
No!

20:48.187 --> 20:50.140
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

21:25.870 --> 21:28.127
(BELL TOLLING)

21:28.291 --> 21:31.235
She was so angry.
And who can blame her?

21:31.658 --> 21:33.347
I hate to say this,
but had you come clean with her,

21:33.371 --> 21:34.702
she might've understood.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.314
I might've understood.

21:36.916 --> 21:39.510
Jace's demon blood?
Valentine's experiments?

21:39.535 --> 21:41.308
I mean, how could you not tell me that?
I tell you everything!

21:41.332 --> 21:43.924
- I was trying to protect you!
- Trying to protect me?

21:44.267 --> 21:45.609
That's what you said about Clary

21:45.634 --> 21:47.305
when we talked about
wiping her memory.

21:47.330 --> 21:49.078
And look where that got you.

21:53.702 --> 21:55.684
I was afraid to lose you.

22:05.797 --> 22:07.749
Clary didn't activate
her anti-tracking rune.

22:07.774 --> 22:09.274
I know where she is.

22:11.153 --> 22:12.630
Then what do you need me for?

22:12.708 --> 22:14.204
To talk to her.

22:14.229 --> 22:17.278
Convince her she's not safe
in the mundane world. Not now.

22:17.303 --> 22:19.333
- Look, you're her mother.
- Exactly.

22:19.707 --> 22:22.942
She won't listen to me,
but she'll listen to you.

22:27.123 --> 22:28.423
All right. Let's go.

22:34.898 --> 22:36.710
Portaling is not my thing.

22:37.382 --> 22:39.644
Is there, like,
a YouTube tutorial I can watch?

22:39.669 --> 22:41.530
Practice makes perfect.

22:43.465 --> 22:45.772
Wait, are we in India?

22:46.960 --> 22:48.779
Welcome to Agra.

22:56.101 --> 22:58.428
Wait, Camille lives in India?

22:58.453 --> 22:59.995
Camille lives
wherever she wants.

23:00.020 --> 23:01.508
Homes all over the globe.

23:01.533 --> 23:03.713
She's always liked to
spend the winters in Agra.

23:04.151 --> 23:06.154
She loves the smell
of lotus blossoms.

23:06.179 --> 23:07.479
Who doesn't?

23:08.924 --> 23:11.209
Hmm. I recognize that.

23:11.569 --> 23:12.869
Ming dynasty.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.850
Of course I recognize it.
It's mine.

23:16.875 --> 23:19.275
Well, unless she's in that vase,
she's not here. So, come on.

23:19.397 --> 23:22.076
You said there are, like,
62 other rooms we have to search.

23:22.102 --> 23:23.249
You go on.

23:23.274 --> 23:24.811
I have a few things
Camille never returned

23:24.835 --> 23:27.047
after one of our many breakups.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.108
I wanna find them.

23:28.133 --> 23:29.211
So you're not going
to help me find her?

23:29.235 --> 23:30.657
I Portaled you to India.

23:30.682 --> 23:33.360
The rest of your sire
squabble is all on you.

23:33.657 --> 23:36.483
Now go. And find me when
you're ready to leave.

23:36.508 --> 23:38.570
Preferably after you
dealt with Camille.

23:38.595 --> 23:40.329
Right, because why would
you need a powerful warlock

23:40.353 --> 23:42.422
when you've got a scrappy
nerd from Brooklyn?

23:42.658 --> 23:44.227
What are you so afraid of?

23:44.252 --> 23:46.891
Where do I start? Elevators.
Snakes. Clowns.

23:46.916 --> 23:48.742
Raphael trying to
burn my junk off...

23:48.767 --> 23:50.266
You're a vampire, Simon.

23:50.291 --> 23:51.977
You're tougher than you think.

23:52.002 --> 23:55.008
Honestly, it's time to man up.

24:16.530 --> 24:18.231
- Hey, kiddo.
- (GASPS)

24:21.684 --> 24:25.119
You have to come back to the Institute.
It's not safe.

24:26.293 --> 24:28.197
So, wait,
are you on her side now?

24:28.222 --> 24:29.463
There are no sides.

24:29.502 --> 24:32.180
So you're okay with her
trying to kill Jace?

24:32.329 --> 24:33.399
LUKE: I didn't say that.

24:33.424 --> 24:35.954
But your mother's right.
You need to get back to the Institute.

24:36.436 --> 24:39.505
I can't help Jace.
I don't have enough training.

24:39.530 --> 24:43.114
And even if I did,
I'm Valentine's daughter.

24:43.797 --> 24:45.318
Nobody there trusts me.

24:46.014 --> 24:47.835
For 18 years,

24:47.860 --> 24:51.499
you made me believe that I
could live a normal life.

24:54.146 --> 24:56.056
This life.

24:58.454 --> 25:00.039
But I can't, can I?

25:00.382 --> 25:01.750
No.

25:01.775 --> 25:03.609
'Cause I'm not a mundane.

25:03.634 --> 25:05.270
(CHUCKLES) I'm not
a Shadowhunter.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.695
I'm not anything.

25:15.322 --> 25:16.540
Dot?

25:17.970 --> 25:20.805
I thought you were dead.
What happened to you?

25:21.782 --> 25:23.889
- JOCELYN: Clary!
- Dot, what's going on?

25:26.185 --> 25:27.819
Clary! No!

25:46.851 --> 25:50.640
Wait. This...
this is Valentine's ship, isn't it?

25:50.954 --> 25:52.346
He's misunderstood.

25:52.372 --> 25:54.446
- He is a murderer.
- This is war.

25:56.505 --> 25:59.262
- I want you to see something.
- What?

25:59.270 --> 26:01.433
There are things that you
can do as a Shadowhunter,

26:01.458 --> 26:04.153
but there's so much
more you're capable of.

26:04.178 --> 26:05.478
Let me show you.

26:10.586 --> 26:11.886
(GASPS)

26:22.153 --> 26:24.377
Aldertree's strategy
isn't working.

26:24.705 --> 26:27.182
We've only been to one gym so far.
We have to be patient.

26:27.207 --> 26:29.049
The Circle members all
took the same oath.

26:29.074 --> 26:31.128
They're gonna keep slitting their
throats before they tell us anything.

26:31.152 --> 26:32.557
Do you have any other ideas?

26:32.582 --> 26:34.222
ALEC: Put in a request
for a maritime mission.

26:34.246 --> 26:35.393
Take out a vessel ourselves.

26:35.418 --> 26:38.033
Alec, the ship is glamoured.
It won't show up on the sonar.

26:38.058 --> 26:39.959
Well, it can't hide from
us if we run right into it.

26:39.983 --> 26:42.080
It's a pretty big
ocean out there.

26:42.392 --> 26:43.692
Look...

26:45.977 --> 26:47.805
you know he's not hurt.

26:47.830 --> 26:50.010
Otherwise, you would have
felt something, right?

26:51.029 --> 26:52.726
I don't feel anything, Izzy.

26:53.453 --> 26:54.985
That's what scares me.

26:59.720 --> 27:00.956
SIMON: Camille?

27:00.981 --> 27:02.589
Camille, are you down here?

27:02.614 --> 27:03.831
Camille?

27:04.930 --> 27:06.230
Camille?

27:09.468 --> 27:10.768
Camille?

27:13.747 --> 27:15.047

Oh, jeez.

27:40.206 --> 27:41.915
Hey, hey, snakey.

27:41.940 --> 27:44.333
Nice snakey. Go away, please.

27:46.193 --> 27:47.902

27:47.927 --> 27:50.582

I still suck at <i>encantos!</i>

27:51.315 --> 27:53.240
Those veins on Dot's face.
I'd know them anywhere.

27:53.264 --> 27:54.879
They're from
Valentine's injections.

27:54.904 --> 27:56.419
He must have used
her to grab Clary.

27:56.444 --> 27:58.168
That means Jace is nearby.

27:58.447 --> 28:00.332
We find Jace, we find Clary.

28:00.372 --> 28:02.238
And how is a cat statue
gonna help us do that?

28:02.263 --> 28:03.270
It's not.

28:07.844 --> 28:08.906
This is.

28:08.931 --> 28:10.521
It's from the Adamant Citadel.

28:10.546 --> 28:11.585
I got it from my mother.

28:11.610 --> 28:13.593
And the <i>adamas</i> can track Jace?

28:13.618 --> 28:15.070
Not by itself.

28:17.319 --> 28:19.713
(SIGHS) We should look
at the aerial drones.

28:19.714 --> 28:22.028
- We've already done that.
- So we do it again.

28:22.053 --> 28:23.364
Maybe we didn't
look close enough.

28:23.388 --> 28:25.307
Alec, I know you're
upset, but this is just...

28:25.332 --> 28:27.488
You don't know, Izzy.

28:28.977 --> 28:30.417
(SIGHS HEAVILY)

28:33.162 --> 28:34.462
I need him.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.202

28:42.704 --> 28:44.424
JOCELYN: Alec, Isabelle.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.130
I have a way.

28:49.936 --> 28:51.809
How did you get that?

28:51.834 --> 28:54.144
Only the Iron Sisters
have access to <i>adamas.</i>

28:54.169 --> 28:55.739
Luke's mother is an Iron Sister.

28:55.764 --> 28:57.450
She told him about
an ancient way

28:57.475 --> 28:59.700
to communicate through
the <i>parabatai</i> bond.

28:59.725 --> 29:01.723
Through your linked spirits.

29:02.087 --> 29:03.250
Oh, I see.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.798
So you want me to help
you find my brother,

29:05.823 --> 29:07.564
so you can try and
kill him again?

29:07.589 --> 29:10.532
No. I want to find Clary.

29:10.557 --> 29:12.595
She was kidnapped by Dot.

29:14.348 --> 29:16.501
Valentine must be behind this.

29:16.643 --> 29:17.814
Why should we trust you?

29:17.839 --> 29:21.236
Look, I know how much
your brother means to you.

29:21.261 --> 29:24.384
And Clary means
just as much to me.

29:25.049 --> 29:28.368
And I will do anything
to get her back.

29:31.503 --> 29:33.527
What other choice do we have?

29:41.092 --> 29:42.592
CLARY: Jace? (GASPS)

29:43.054 --> 29:45.155
I've had enough of
your mind games.

29:45.180 --> 29:46.631
- It's me.
- Right.

29:46.656 --> 29:48.681
Jace, it's me. I swear.

29:49.039 --> 29:51.215
Remember when you taught me how
to see through the glamours?

29:51.239 --> 29:53.386
I got <i>encantoed</i> by that vampire.

29:53.568 --> 29:56.629
I... I wanted to be so angry at
you, but...

29:57.170 --> 29:59.902
You took me on my
first motorcycle ride.

30:04.774 --> 30:06.015
What are you doing here?

30:06.040 --> 30:08.167
- Dot brought me.
- Dot?

30:09.235 --> 30:10.523
She's alive?

30:10.738 --> 30:12.335
Why...
why would she bring you here?

30:12.360 --> 30:14.210
She wanted to show me something.

30:14.722 --> 30:17.881
Jace, I...
I know this sounds crazy, but...

30:19.185 --> 30:21.077
I can see the future.

30:23.159 --> 30:25.052
No, that's not...
that's not possible.

30:25.077 --> 30:26.522
Shadowhunters can't do
that, Clary...

30:26.546 --> 30:29.091
Then I guess I'm not your
ordinary Shadowhunter.

30:29.749 --> 30:31.049
Neither are you.

30:34.710 --> 30:36.555
I never wanted this, Jace.

30:37.419 --> 30:40.844
I never wanted any of it.

30:42.940 --> 30:44.440
What did you see?

30:44.465 --> 30:46.160
The Downworlders.

30:47.197 --> 30:51.388
They slaughter the mundanes,
one by one, until...

30:52.315 --> 30:54.023
there's no one left.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.172
And, Jace,
with your demon blood, you...

30:57.211 --> 30:59.280
you're the only one
that can stop them.

31:05.346 --> 31:06.736
My children.

31:08.076 --> 31:09.967
This is what I've always wanted.

31:10.567 --> 31:13.344
- To be with my family.
- You and I are not family.

31:13.345 --> 31:15.985
Clary, I am your father,
and I do love you.

31:18.725 --> 31:21.585
So are you gonna join Jeremy?
He's going big game hunting.

31:21.610 --> 31:24.085
We just got intel on the wolf
that killed Jeremy's father.

31:24.110 --> 31:25.991
We're gonna bring the
beast back to the boat.

31:29.428 --> 31:31.961
Look, since Jace doesn't want to
go, why don't you come along, Clary?

31:31.985 --> 31:34.051
Hone those Shadowhunting
skills of yours, huh?

31:34.076 --> 31:35.376
No.

31:35.863 --> 31:37.163
She's, uh...

31:37.958 --> 31:40.505
she's not ready to face
a cornered werewolf.

31:41.364 --> 31:42.732

- Great.

on your Christmas list. (CHUCKLES)

the stone all along,

33:52.006 --> 33:54.713
why didn't he say anything
when Jace first went missing?

33:54.971 --> 33:56.369
I'll be honest.

33:56.394 --> 33:59.182
There are some serious
risks involved.

What kind of risks?

34:01.121 --> 34:04.307
The <i>parabatai</i> that
initiates the contact,

34:04.732 --> 34:06.591
it can be taxing on his body...

- on his mind...
- Izzy, it's fine.

No.

Valentine made me
cast a spell on you

so that you'd do as I'd say.

remember when I got grounded

when my mom realized that
I went to see Simon's band?

35:50.906 --> 35:54.446
You brought me gelato from
Little Italy to cheer me up.

35:54.860 --> 35:56.964
I will never forget that.

35:58.672 --> 36:01.035
It wasn't from Little Italy.

36:01.830 --> 36:03.926
It was from Rome.

36:05.465 --> 36:08.051
See? You were like
a big sister to me.

36:09.008 --> 36:12.590
Dot, you have always had my
back, no matter what.

36:14.187 --> 36:17.135
Why did you stop looking for me?

36:19.475 --> 36:22.169

had killed you.

We may not be able to go
back to the way things were,

to be like this.

and Camille is
nowhere to be found.

37:47.882 --> 37:51.701
We might not have her,
but at least we have this.

37:52.013 --> 37:54.358
This?
From inside the serpent statue?

37:54.383 --> 37:56.412
This... helps me how?

37:56.437 --> 37:58.207
If Camille had that
snake guarding it,

37:58.232 --> 37:59.623
it must be precious to her.

37:59.648 --> 38:03.068
Maybe you can use what's
inside it to lure her back.

38:03.130 --> 38:05.006

38:05.685 --> 38:07.092
- How?
- I wish I knew.

38:07.117 --> 38:10.498
Whatever it is, it has wards

38:35.874 --> 38:38.836
discovering my

38:39.715 --> 38:42.685
I had to figure out the
Downworld all on my own.

38:43.859 --> 38:45.159
It was awful.

38:46.127 --> 38:48.445
So... I vowed to myself

38:48.470 --> 38:51.687
that if I ever found someone
in a similar situation,

38:52.105 --> 38:54.605
I'd try to make sure they
didn't have to go at it alone.

38:55.469 --> 38:57.712
So you're gonna be, like,
my Downworld sponsor. Cool.

- No.

38:59.617 --> 39:01.406
I said I'll try.

39:01.649 --> 39:04.491
Even though I've lived more
centuries than I'd like to admit,

39:04.516 --> 39:05.945
it doesn't mean I'm patient.

39:05.970 --> 39:07.000
(CHUCKLES)

39:07.025 --> 39:08.250
Noted.

39:15.159 --> 39:16.979
Ah, there you are!

39:18.414 --> 39:20.565
There's only one last
thing for you to do.

39:21.096 --> 39:22.206
Kill her.

39:22.231 --> 39:23.768
No! Please!

39:23.793 --> 39:25.963
She's our prisoner.
She can't hurt anybody here.

39:25.988 --> 39:27.994
If only she had shown her
victims as much mercy.

39:28.019 --> 39:30.229
After what she did,
we're letting her off easy.

39:30.254 --> 39:33.026
What are you talking about?
I've done nothing wrong.

39:33.066 --> 39:36.260
Five years ago, my father was
mauled to death by a white wolf.

39:41.338 --> 39:43.848
That was you.
You did that, didn't you?

39:44.291 --> 39:45.629
You murdered him,
an innocent mundane.

39:45.653 --> 39:47.659
No, I've never killed anyone.
I swear.

39:47.684 --> 39:49.617
- I'm telling the truth.
- Don't lie to me.

39:49.642 --> 39:51.151
Please don't kill me.

39:51.321 --> 39:52.949
I've obeyed the Accords.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.471
I'm part of Luke's pack.

39:54.496 --> 39:56.292
We don't hurt anyone.
We're not like that.

39:56.317 --> 39:58.601
A wolf will say
anything to go free,

39:58.626 --> 40:01.604
but she can never
change what she is.

40:02.213 --> 40:04.611
You let her live, son,
and she will kill again...

40:04.661 --> 40:07.448
and again and again.

40:08.823 --> 40:10.123
CLARY: Jace!

40:10.724 --> 40:12.667
Clarissa,
how nice of you to join us.

40:12.692 --> 40:15.512
Perhaps you can convince your
brother to finish what he started.

40:19.511 --> 40:21.257
Jace,
I need you to listen to me.

40:21.282 --> 40:24.077
Everything I said before,
I was under a spell.

40:24.585 --> 40:25.677
Run!

40:26.535 --> 40:27.835
VALENTINE: Jonathan!

40:30.618 --> 40:32.074
Jonathan!

40:32.130 --> 40:33.620
There's no way out.

40:35.586 --> 40:37.086
Jonathan!

41:07.725 --> 41:09.631
- (COUGHS)
- Jace, are you okay?

41:09.656 --> 41:11.022
VALENTINE: Jonathan!

41:11.047 --> 41:12.413
(GROANING)

41:14.875 --> 41:18.215
Jonathan, come back here!
There's nowhere to run!

41:23.299 --> 41:25.451
Jace, we have to go now!

41:26.621 --> 41:28.141
Jace!

41:38.156 --> 41:40.010
ISABELLE: Alec!

41:50.131 --> 41:52.345
Take the warlock down below.

42:00.829 --> 42:02.506
Throw the wolf overboard.

42:10.231 --> 42:14.309
