41:09.347 --> 41:11.640
I'll think about it.

41:37.165 --> 41:39.827
She's dying.
She's dying.

41:39.828 --> 41:41.709
She's... she's dying.

41:41.710 --> 41:43.791
Connor, there is nothing
we can do for her.
No.

41:43.792 --> 41:45.172
The police are gonna be here
any second.

41:45.173 --> 41:47.715
I don't care!
Damn it, Connor.

41:47.716 --> 41:49.757
It's the only way
we end up okay...

41:49.758 --> 41:51.468
If we leave right now.

41:51.469 --> 41:54.091
Please, Connor.

41:54.092 --> 41:55.553
Please.

41:55.554 --> 41:56.434
Please.

41:56.435 --> 41:58.687
Please.

42:11.570 --> 42:13.951
Have you seen this woman before?

42:13.952 --> 42:16.114
