16:52.178 --> 16:53.778
in the hot tub?

16:53.780 --> 16:54.912
Hey, there she goes.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.681
Ahoy, miss possible!

16:56.683 --> 16:59.217
Kim, small world.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.199
If this is what happens

17:15.201 --> 17:17.602
when Team Impossible
captures you,

17:17.604 --> 17:18.502
I'm ready, capture me!

17:18.504 --> 17:23.307
Captured? This is an
all-expense-paid vacation.

17:23.309 --> 17:24.007
Grab a fruit cup!

17:24.009 --> 17:26.277
And no television,
no papers, no phones.

17:26.279 --> 17:30.281
It is as if the outside
world does not exist.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.916
Oh, this doesn't make sense.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.885
P.A.: Of course it does.

17:34.720 --> 17:35.519
Aah! Unh!
Aah! Unh!

17:35.521 --> 17:38.322
If it keeps you stuck in
Middleton, it's worth it.

17:38.324 --> 17:41.559
Ha! Even with
the all-you-can-eat buffet,

17:41.561 --> 17:42.860
we're still making a mint.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.229
As long as we get the missions.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.297
And you don't.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.097
Were we too subtle?

17:47.099 --> 17:50.668
The cheerleader-saves-the-world
thing has gotten tedious.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.769
It's over.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.105
Forever.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.779
Bring...
It...

18:01.781 --> 18:02.680
On.

18:02.682 --> 18:04.315
Oh, we're ready.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.783
Right, Ron?

18:05.785 --> 18:07.885
Uh, yeah, uh, ahem.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.153
Define "ready."

18:09.155 --> 18:11.656
You're prepared
not to get in the way.

18:11.658 --> 18:14.292
Oh, yeah, ready.
Huh, yeah.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.176
Oh, these guys are wigged!

18:32.178 --> 18:33.778
Ooh, yeah.

18:34.141 --> 18:34.813
Excuse me?!

18:34.814 --> 18:37.915
Good work. You rule.
Old school. Heh.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.050
I thought you were
supposed to be

18:39.052 --> 18:40.985
some sort of
master monkey kung fu.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.820
You know, it's funny.
It comes and goes.

18:42.822 --> 18:43.855
Hey, dash.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.790
I'm waiting.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.792
I wish there was another way.

18:47.794 --> 18:48.392
Really?
No.

18:48.394 --> 18:50.995
I'm told we should always
say that for legal reasons.

18:50.997 --> 18:52.964
It shields us from liability.

18:52.966 --> 18:57.168
I think you need to worry about
shielding yourself from me.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.236
So be it.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.071
Dude, you are so over.

19:00.073 --> 19:01.305
I can take her.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.273
No.
Sorry.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.475
Do you know what
I'm capable of?

19:04.477 --> 19:05.910
I've got a general idea.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.212
And? Dude, you are so over.

19:08.214 --> 19:11.115
Let's just see about that.

19:13.685 --> 19:14.952
Nobody...

19:14.954 --> 19:17.355
Nobody spikes my system!

19:17.357 --> 19:18.990
Wade!
Wade?!

19:18.992 --> 19:19.891
In person?!

19:19.893 --> 19:21.659
Dude, now you are so over,

19:21.661 --> 19:23.060
I don't even wanna stand
near you.

19:23.062 --> 19:26.164
Wow, you have really
perfected the holo-weight.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.231
It's really me, Ron.

19:27.233 --> 19:27.931
Yeah, right.

19:27.933 --> 19:31.102
If it were really you,
I couldn't do this.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.304
[Babbling]

19:33.306 --> 19:38.309
Team Impossible is the world's greatest
team of high-danger operatives.

19:38.311 --> 19:42.213
We will not be intimidated
by children.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.348
You're not helping yourself.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.184
I'm so not afraid.

19:46.186 --> 19:47.218
You should be.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.120
Remember Kim's first mission?

19:49.122 --> 19:50.821
Ron, get over
here... quickly.

19:50.823 --> 19:54.025
It was supposed to be our mission.
What else do I need to know?

19:54.027 --> 19:56.360
Does the McHenry laser grid
ring a bell?

19:56.362 --> 19:59.330
Yeah. Cost paisley
a fortune.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.932
So we had to have one, too.

20:00.934 --> 20:04.335
Nothing but the best
for Team Impossible.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.404
Whoops.

20:08.985 --> 20:09.841
Look familiar?

20:09.842 --> 20:12.443
You rock even more
in person, Wade.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.745
Somehow I thought
you'd be shorter.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.782
Danger has been
our closest friend,

20:17.784 --> 20:19.050
but I'm not liking this.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.319
Ah, easy enough to disable.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.419
Just hit that red button.

20:22.421 --> 20:27.391
One bad twitch, and you'll know
what my fried system feels like.

20:27.492 --> 20:30.394
Ok, maybe he shouldn't
have left his room.

20:30.396 --> 20:31.362
What are you doing?

20:31.364 --> 20:32.830
Nobody could get that.

20:32.832 --> 20:33.998
It's... Impossible.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.166
Yeah. For you,
maybe.

20:35.168 --> 20:38.169
For me?
Well, we'll see.

20:47.246 --> 20:51.115
It was actually possible
that Team Impossible...

20:51.117 --> 20:52.015
Could've been fried.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.815
That would've impacted
our earning potential.

20:53.817 --> 20:57.989
Cheerleader-saves-the-world thing
doesn't look so bad now. Does it?

20:57.991 --> 20:59.490
Guys, you need to get wise.

20:59.492 --> 21:02.393
I think I know how
to work this out.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.061
Gentlemen...

21:04.063 --> 21:06.130
This is the naco.

21:06.132 --> 21:09.200
It looks like a taco
and some nachos.

21:09.202 --> 21:10.768
All mashed together.

[Slurp]

21:12.438 --> 21:13.136
Mmm!

21:13.138 --> 21:15.473
So... Do we have
an understanding?

21:15.475 --> 21:17.241
Well, if by that, do you
mean are we going to

21:17.243 --> 21:18.976
quit charging money
to help people

21:18.978 --> 21:23.314
and join global justice
as you suggested?

21:23.849 --> 21:25.249
Hard to say.

21:25.251 --> 21:26.350
Uh, guys.

21:26.352 --> 21:27.050
Uh-oh.

21:27.052 --> 21:29.186
You don't have
this place wired.

21:29.188 --> 21:32.156
Trust me on this:
Wade has the world wired.

21:32.158 --> 21:35.926
Team Impossible
is now nonprofit.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.863
Which actually has
some tax advantages.

21:38.865 --> 21:39.763
I'm proud of you guys.

21:39.765 --> 21:42.166
So, with Team Impossible
out of the picture...

21:42.168 --> 21:45.870
No, we will not start charging
money for our missions.

21:45.872 --> 21:47.438
