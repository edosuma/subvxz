00:10.309 --> 00:13.146
Jakob. Are you there, Jakob?

00:13.896 --> 00:15.731
Are you listening?

00:16.449 --> 00:17.984
Jakob.

00:19.986 --> 00:21.521
Jakob.

00:31.831 --> 00:33.699
I'm here.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.568
I'm right here.

00:36.936 --> 00:38.472
Don't.

00:38.922 --> 00:41.945
Be silent. And hear me.

00:42.475 --> 00:44.543
This is how it must be.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.954
Another woman will come.

00:54.654 --> 00:56.455
You will see.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.558
There will be another.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.362
You will know her...

01:04.464 --> 01:06.944
...by the love she shows to you.

01:11.604 --> 01:14.441
Let the words you speak...

01:15.000 --> 01:19.425
...be the words that call me back to you.

01:20.546 --> 01:22.382
Promise me.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.050
Promise.

01:29.088 --> 01:30.590
Jakob.

01:43.552 --> 01:46.789
I will always be your mother.

02:22.775 --> 02:23.909
No.

02:28.241 --> 02:29.782
Carlotta.

02:35.605 --> 02:37.790
- Carlotta...
- Arrivederci.

02:43.712 --> 02:46.339
I hardly know the woman I see.

02:48.067 --> 02:49.902
Her name is Verena.

02:51.404 --> 02:53.088
She is alone.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.381
She remembers all of them.

03:04.116 --> 03:05.952
Every parting.

03:06.702 --> 03:09.241
Her life is measured out in goodbyes.

03:11.057 --> 03:13.659
Each one harder than the last.

03:16.496 --> 03:18.347
Enter La Rocciosa...

03:20.733 --> 03:22.935
...and the boy who wouldn't speak.

05:07.674 --> 05:09.542
My first language.

05:09.902 --> 05:13.312
I have these from previous employers.

05:24.290 --> 05:26.392
Did you live with each family?

05:26.492 --> 05:31.697
Yes. I find it helps in understanding
the child to know the family.

05:31.797 --> 05:34.600
And do you remain in contact
with these people?

05:34.700 --> 05:40.288
When a child recovers, the family
will generally choose to forget.

05:40.973 --> 05:44.410
You've no degree. But they say you've a gift.

05:44.510 --> 05:47.513
My skill comes through experience...

05:48.063 --> 05:50.689
...and a certain, um, sensitivity.

05:50.789 --> 05:53.119
Sensitivity. Mmm.

05:53.419 --> 05:55.621
You have no children of your own.

05:56.749 --> 05:59.157
- No.
- Hmm.

05:59.405 --> 06:01.127
Your son.

06:01.227 --> 06:03.462
He prefers English?

06:03.562 --> 06:05.363
His mother.

06:05.965 --> 06:08.567
My wife wanted him to speak it.

06:10.636 --> 06:12.938
She died. There was an illness.

06:13.038 --> 06:15.507
My son has not spoken since.

06:15.841 --> 06:17.709
Seven months...

06:18.611 --> 06:20.846
...and 16 days.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.159
Alessio will see you to your room.

06:30.489 --> 06:34.347
I would like to introduce myself to your son.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.088
You haven't told me his name.

06:41.750 --> 06:44.336
I must say there have been other nurses...

06:44.436 --> 06:48.040
...all of them as sure
of their talents as you.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.311
My son's name is Jakob.

07:10.512 --> 07:12.331
Hello, Jakob.

07:12.798 --> 07:15.067
My name is Verena...

07:15.467 --> 07:18.337
...and I'm going to be
staying here for a while.

07:19.705 --> 07:23.676
I promise I'm not like the others.
I'm much worse.

07:26.245 --> 07:27.950
Please look at me, Jakob.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.854
I'd like to help you. Do you understand?

07:34.954 --> 07:36.788
There's no point.

07:39.158 --> 07:42.761
He won't even nod his head.
He won't write or draw...

07:44.396 --> 07:46.865
Sing or laugh, hmm?

07:47.800 --> 07:49.368
Smile...

07:51.837 --> 07:53.372
...cry.

08:13.542 --> 08:15.093
Grazie.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.681
We'll begin our work in the morning, Jakob.

08:36.181 --> 08:37.982
Say 9:00?

08:38.517 --> 08:40.553
Your questions are wasted.

08:41.053 --> 08:44.890
Jakob doesn't need to answer me.
I think he understands that.

08:49.408 --> 08:50.996
Enough.

08:55.805 --> 08:57.636
Sit down.

09:10.299 --> 09:12.100
Now you may go.

09:14.186 --> 09:16.021
Good night, Jakob.

09:22.761 --> 09:25.545
- He is very obedient.
- Hmm.

09:25.915 --> 09:27.734
This is part of it.

09:28.634 --> 09:31.503
To disobey is to say something, so...

09:32.404 --> 09:34.440
...so he obeys.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.208
He isn't trying to hurt you.

09:36.308 --> 09:39.745
That's my son, signorina, not me. Hmm.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.050
Jakob doesn't want you here.

09:45.150 --> 09:48.225
He hasn't shown it yet, but he will.

09:49.205 --> 09:51.857
There is such power in his silence.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.913
You will feel it.

09:57.663 --> 09:59.878
You speak very harshly to him.

10:04.803 --> 10:06.672
Braver than the others.

10:12.544 --> 10:16.151
- I have some things I need to ask.
- What things?

10:20.002 --> 10:22.854
Tomorrow, perhaps.

11:30.989 --> 11:34.239
To begin with, I will tell you what I see.

11:35.481 --> 11:37.263
I see...

11:38.013 --> 11:41.733
...that if you wanted to speak, you could.

11:44.536 --> 11:47.807
Hmm, and I see how hard it must be...

11:48.507 --> 11:50.308
...to truly say nothing.

11:52.044 --> 11:55.847
How hard you must be
concentrating every moment.

11:57.100 --> 12:01.349
And I must admit, you're very good at it.

12:07.292 --> 12:11.129
I know a little something of what
it feels to be apart from the world.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.267
I lost my mother when I was
a little bit younger than you.

12:17.536 --> 12:20.172
And my father when I was a little bit older.

12:28.947 --> 12:30.749
It's a lovely day.

12:32.417 --> 12:33.832
I have an idea.

12:40.826 --> 12:42.260
Jakob?

12:44.930 --> 12:46.364
Jakob.

13:03.481 --> 13:04.983
Buongiorno.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.404
Grazie.

13:29.374 --> 13:30.909
Jakob?

14:06.345 --> 14:07.879
Jakob?

15:36.401 --> 15:37.937
Jakob?

15:52.417 --> 15:54.430
Oh. Please, forgive me. I didn't...

15:54.530 --> 15:56.054
Verena.

15:56.488 --> 15:58.957
The nurse, of course.

16:01.476 --> 16:03.744
Come closer. Come.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.017
Let Lilia see you.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.187
You've come to make the boy talk.

16:12.287 --> 16:15.974
- Just to help if I can.
- Oh, welcome.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.444
Welcome. Welcome to La Rocciosa, my child.

16:19.544 --> 16:21.079
Grazie.

16:22.320 --> 16:24.182
You're very kind.

16:25.550 --> 16:27.386
But I should go.

16:27.486 --> 16:29.921
Yes, of course. Go find the boy.

16:31.023 --> 16:32.891
Make him talk.

16:57.783 --> 17:00.920
I'm sorry. I was looking for Jakob.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.856
- Do you play?
- No, I, uh, never could.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.364
- This is your wife?
- Yes.

17:12.864 --> 17:14.665
What was her name?

17:18.770 --> 17:21.138
You spent time with Jakob this morning.

17:21.239 --> 17:24.175
- Yes.
- And did you observe anything?

17:24.876 --> 17:27.744
I need to understand
what he has been through.

17:30.615 --> 17:34.219
Malvina. Malvina Rivi.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.187
You may have heard of her.

17:37.122 --> 17:38.623
No.

17:39.304 --> 17:41.126
That's Carnegie Hall.

17:42.077 --> 17:44.890
She played all over the world,
in all the great halls...

17:44.990 --> 17:47.202
...for kings and queens...

17:47.302 --> 17:48.933
presidents.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.273
She was very beautiful.

17:55.073 --> 17:58.543
Six months after that photograph
was taken, she was dead.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.446
It began after our return.

18:02.180 --> 18:06.985
It started as a simple fever
and it became like fire.

18:07.085 --> 18:11.186
Each day, it consumed a little
bit more of her strength...

18:11.973 --> 18:13.465
...her beauty.

18:15.193 --> 18:19.097
I had to leave to find help...

18:19.197 --> 18:22.033
...and Jakob stayed with her.

18:23.548 --> 18:26.402
He and Lilia nursed her together.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.176
He wouldn't leave his mother's side.

18:34.212 --> 18:35.713
Hmm.

18:37.509 --> 18:39.751
He has his mother's gift.

18:42.120 --> 18:46.958
They would sit here
and play together for hours.

18:53.432 --> 18:55.333
He chooses not to speak?

18:55.433 --> 18:58.203
Oh... oh, this...

18:58.303 --> 19:01.773
...this must be that incredible
sensitivity of yours?

19:01.873 --> 19:04.209
I mean, there is no injury?

19:04.309 --> 19:06.488
No incapacity?

19:06.588 --> 19:09.080
Something inside him has been broken.

19:10.515 --> 19:12.750
It is simply a refusal.

19:13.685 --> 19:15.583
A denial.

19:16.121 --> 19:18.590
As if, by this vigil...

19:19.925 --> 19:23.495
...he can undo what is done.

19:23.595 --> 19:26.999
You're telling me he wants
his mother back, hmm?

19:27.749 --> 19:31.042
Well, that's a... that's a revelation.

19:53.424 --> 19:56.125
I've... I've been looking for you, Jakob.

19:57.762 --> 20:01.655
I'm here to work, not to play hide-and-seek.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.574
No.

20:14.245 --> 20:16.481
I haven't finished yet, Jakob.

20:34.883 --> 20:37.109
You have a very beautiful home.

20:37.209 --> 20:39.103
Thank you.

20:40.738 --> 20:43.207
I do hope you'll be comfortable here.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.043
Once, Jakob...

20:51.283 --> 20:53.518
...I stayed with a family in Lucca.

20:55.353 --> 20:59.225
Their house hadn't been cleaned in years.

21:00.325 --> 21:04.196
There were cockroaches
as big as your father's watch.

21:04.946 --> 21:09.134
And once, I stayed with a family in Piacenza.

21:09.234 --> 21:11.702
I shared a room with the cook...

21:12.737 --> 21:17.155
...who snored come un bufalo.

21:19.978 --> 21:22.848
So, yes, I'm sure...

21:23.248 --> 21:25.683
...I will be very comfortable here.

21:25.783 --> 21:28.253
In truth, I cannot think
of this place as my own.

21:28.353 --> 21:32.814
My wife's family
has lived here for 1,200 years.

21:34.271 --> 21:36.140
I'm just a visitor.

21:36.928 --> 21:39.631
Alessio's family has been here
for just as long.

21:39.731 --> 21:42.934
The women work here in the house.

21:43.868 --> 21:45.613
The men, in the quarry.

21:46.538 --> 21:48.206
- The quarry?
- Mmm.

21:48.306 --> 21:51.810
It's where all this comes from,
the wealth of the family.

21:51.910 --> 21:54.378
The stone was once highly prized.

21:55.313 --> 21:56.715
Was?

21:57.015 --> 22:00.251
She allowed it to flood
at the beginning of the War.

22:00.351 --> 22:02.186
Times were difficult...

22:03.254 --> 22:05.507
...and she had her career.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.959
No more need for the stone.

22:09.644 --> 22:11.529
Jakob swims there.

22:13.531 --> 22:15.733
He'll take you there if you wish.

22:16.601 --> 22:18.003
Yes.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.204
I'd like that very much.

24:21.292 --> 24:22.903
Let me.

24:24.195 --> 24:25.763
Per favore.

24:36.674 --> 24:38.743
It's been so long.

24:42.880 --> 24:48.552
I used to do this to her
every night of her life...

24:49.704 --> 24:52.789
...since she was a tiny girl.

24:56.728 --> 24:58.998
She began to perform...

25:00.398 --> 25:02.266
...when she was 14.

25:04.569 --> 25:07.208
She took me with her everywhere.

25:11.276 --> 25:14.078
Nobody knew her as I did.

25:17.615 --> 25:19.818
Knew her moods...

25:19.918 --> 25:21.785
...her needs.

25:22.887 --> 25:24.388
Oh.

25:25.323 --> 25:27.358
How I loved her.

26:06.951 --> 26:11.786
Jakob, was it you? If it was, then all
you've done is tell me you're afraid.

26:11.886 --> 26:13.404
Ja...

26:15.907 --> 26:17.375
Jakob.

26:19.344 --> 26:21.212
Jakob, what is it?

26:38.596 --> 26:40.030
Jakob.

26:40.498 --> 26:42.734
- Ah!
- What?

26:42.834 --> 26:46.471
Jakob, no! Wait! Wait!

26:55.513 --> 26:58.148
Jakob? What? Hey!

27:00.316 --> 27:02.887
Jakob. Jakob, no.

27:02.987 --> 27:06.507
Quiet. Quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet.

27:10.561 --> 27:12.963
Quiet. Enough.

27:23.241 --> 27:24.509
Stop!

27:24.609 --> 27:26.448
I should have left him. He was...

27:27.178 --> 27:30.682
- He was by the wall as if he was...
- Listening.

27:30.782 --> 27:33.017
Yes, I've seen him do it.

27:33.117 --> 27:36.754
In his bedroom. Also in the garden.

27:38.289 --> 27:40.091
In the quarry.

27:40.541 --> 27:44.396
I assume it's his mother
he hears or thinks he hears.

27:44.796 --> 27:48.662
- It seems to give him comfort.
- I should have been told.

27:52.944 --> 27:55.440
It changes the situation.

27:55.740 --> 27:59.043
It may indicate a far more serious condition.

27:59.143 --> 28:01.145
You don't believe in such voices?

28:01.245 --> 28:02.781
No.

28:03.381 --> 28:06.104
- No, signore, I do not.
- Nor do I.

28:06.204 --> 28:08.485
Sometimes I wish I did.

28:10.209 --> 28:14.759
Have you considered
taking him away from this place?

28:14.859 --> 28:17.862
Yes, of course. It was impossible.

28:17.962 --> 28:22.100
It was as you saw last night. He became
a danger to himself and to others.

28:22.200 --> 28:26.694
- Then he should be in a hospital.
- No, absolutely not. No.

28:27.038 --> 28:29.304
Signore, I'm no longer sure
I can care for your son.

28:29.404 --> 28:30.775
Why?

28:30.875 --> 28:33.911
I have been misled about what is required.

28:34.011 --> 28:36.381
I must consider whether
I am properly qualified.

28:36.481 --> 28:38.550
You're just like the others.

28:41.185 --> 28:43.187
I await your decision.

29:11.933 --> 29:13.484
Jakob.

29:14.151 --> 29:17.642
Jakob! Jakob!

30:32.997 --> 30:34.832
Help me down.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.580
You scared me, Jakob.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.116
But you've helped me realize something.

30:55.886 --> 30:58.088
I can't leave you.

31:05.463 --> 31:09.694
I once knew a boy who thought
he could hear his dead sister...

31:09.794 --> 31:12.069
...through the teeth of an old comb.

31:13.504 --> 31:15.907
He would sit with it for hours...

31:16.007 --> 31:19.023
...listening and whispering his secrets.

31:19.443 --> 31:22.479
He was as sure of what he heard as you are.

31:25.850 --> 31:29.086
The mind is capable of extraordinary things.

31:30.588 --> 31:34.599
It is your mind that is speaking
to you, Jakob, nothing else.

31:40.131 --> 31:42.166
I'm not saying that...

31:42.266 --> 31:45.013
...that what you hear isn't real, because...

31:45.113 --> 31:48.973
...anything we experience is real
in its own way, but it's...

31:49.473 --> 31:52.022
...it's not what it pretends to be.

31:53.310 --> 31:55.579
It's important to understand that.

31:59.850 --> 32:01.919
I want to hear you speak.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.156
But I am not your enemy.

32:05.356 --> 32:07.191
I care about you.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.194
What is it?

32:13.180 --> 32:14.998
You wish to leave?

32:50.234 --> 32:51.669
Jakob?

33:21.733 --> 33:22.967
Lucia...

33:23.868 --> 33:25.369
...Ugolina...

33:29.306 --> 33:30.874
...Angelica.

33:33.444 --> 33:35.245
La signora Malvina.

33:39.547 --> 33:40.810
Jakob?

33:41.819 --> 33:43.821
Come with me, please.

35:02.740 --> 35:07.357
I think you're afraid that
if you speak, the voice will cease.

35:10.508 --> 35:11.909
Come.

35:13.143 --> 35:14.945
We'll listen together.

35:17.815 --> 35:19.683
I'll tell you what I hear.

36:01.225 --> 36:03.094
It's strange...

36:03.594 --> 36:05.372
...the sounds.

36:06.180 --> 36:08.665
One could imagine almost anything.

36:12.770 --> 36:14.605
But she's not there.

36:15.806 --> 36:17.875
I want you to stop this.

36:18.475 --> 36:21.345
The dead do not speak.

36:22.746 --> 36:25.549
I know it, Jakob.

36:26.650 --> 36:28.485
I know it well.

36:29.470 --> 36:32.073
However hard we wish them to...

36:32.823 --> 36:36.776
...the dead remain silent.

36:58.949 --> 37:00.817
Good night, Jakob.

38:52.996 --> 38:55.599
Your father told me you have her gift.

38:58.969 --> 39:02.439
What would she say if she knew
you might never use it again?

39:05.776 --> 39:09.713
She must have spoken about the future...

39:09.813 --> 39:12.049
...before she died...

39:12.149 --> 39:15.418
...about the wonderful things
that lie ahead for you.

39:18.322 --> 39:20.557
Try to remember what she said.

39:22.860 --> 39:26.463
And imagine what she might
say now if she could see you.

40:10.608 --> 40:12.210
Buongiorno.

40:13.110 --> 40:17.053
- Signore.
- There's a story about that cat.

40:19.350 --> 40:24.088
It was the custom amongst
those building houses such as this to...

40:24.188 --> 40:28.258
...to seal a cat within the walls
as a protection against evil.

40:28.358 --> 40:32.259
- A dead cat?
- No. Not dead.

40:34.164 --> 40:37.168
- That's horrible.
- Of course.

40:37.668 --> 40:42.039
I'm a fool to speak lightly of it.
Forgive me.

40:42.139 --> 40:44.621
- Jakob will be waiting.
- Yes.

41:08.402 --> 41:10.217
Now, if you were to play...

41:10.867 --> 41:13.903
...it would mean only
what you wanted it to mean.

41:14.408 --> 41:16.289
Play for me, Jakob.

41:26.216 --> 41:30.454
Perhaps I was wrong earlier
when I spoke about your mother.

41:37.661 --> 41:41.145
Perhaps your silence wouldn't...

41:41.245 --> 41:44.467
...horrify her as it does me.

41:46.837 --> 41:51.753
It is said that a true performer
cares only for the love of her audience.

41:56.313 --> 41:57.815
Perhaps...

41:58.715 --> 42:01.118
...your silence is a fitting tribute.

42:05.455 --> 42:08.892
More adoration as she leaves the stage.

42:12.462 --> 42:15.499
What are you telling me, Jakob?
That I'm wrong or that I'm right?

42:15.599 --> 42:17.467
You can't...

42:21.772 --> 42:24.174
I do it to help you, Jakob.

42:31.415 --> 42:33.650
The boy was upset today.

42:34.151 --> 42:36.019
He's sick.

42:37.521 --> 42:39.389
He needs help.

42:41.291 --> 42:43.727
And he's breaking his father's heart.

42:46.430 --> 42:48.265
The boy...

42:48.365 --> 42:50.834
...is all that matters.

42:51.134 --> 42:53.136
He is the future.

42:54.271 --> 42:56.073
Look at yourself...

42:56.173 --> 42:58.207
...how beautiful you are.

43:05.182 --> 43:07.050
Give me your hands.

43:13.624 --> 43:15.092
Oh...

43:16.059 --> 43:17.927
They're strong...

43:18.662 --> 43:20.530
...like hers.

43:24.234 --> 43:26.503
He will not speak to please you.

43:29.306 --> 43:33.343
The boy will speak when the time is right.

43:34.678 --> 43:36.546
He's waiting.

43:38.849 --> 43:40.884
But he's waited long enough.

43:42.986 --> 43:45.624
Surely that is clear to anyone.

43:49.459 --> 43:51.294
When he speaks...

43:52.295 --> 43:54.163
...where will you go?

43:54.831 --> 43:56.900
To the next place.

43:57.004 --> 43:58.611
Oh...

43:59.336 --> 44:01.337
Lonely child.

44:48.852 --> 44:52.055
There's a story
about that cat within the walls.

44:52.155 --> 44:53.780
He's waiting.

45:31.695 --> 45:33.297
Oh...

45:33.397 --> 45:35.832
I wondered if Jakob was still here.

45:36.399 --> 45:37.834
No.

45:41.872 --> 45:43.739
May I see?

45:44.341 --> 45:46.176
If you wish.

45:52.616 --> 45:54.684
It's, uh, my wife.

45:55.152 --> 45:59.380
She was the worst possible model,
restless, complaining.

46:00.190 --> 46:02.159
She was the worst...

46:02.259 --> 46:04.060
...and also the best.

46:06.400 --> 46:08.264
And this one?

46:11.801 --> 46:14.003
I have not worked in many months.

46:16.473 --> 46:18.308
It was to be of her.

46:19.476 --> 46:22.345
You cannot finish it, so you abandoned it.

46:25.081 --> 46:27.584
Perhaps, to see you work...

46:27.684 --> 46:29.719
...it would help Jakob.

46:31.221 --> 46:33.457
Perhaps it would signify hope.

46:34.357 --> 46:35.792
Yes.

46:37.961 --> 46:39.529
Perhaps.

49:27.347 --> 49:28.931
Hello?

49:31.334 --> 49:32.869
Lilia?

50:14.577 --> 50:17.780
I keep it clean for her.

50:23.086 --> 50:25.288
She was here at the end.

50:26.506 --> 50:28.992
We nursed her day and night...

50:29.502 --> 50:31.327
...me and the boy.

50:32.829 --> 50:35.064
He saw terrible things.

50:36.833 --> 50:38.929
He heard...

50:39.965 --> 50:42.025
...terrible things.

50:44.974 --> 50:48.611
And when she died, I washed her...

50:49.946 --> 50:52.181
...and tidied her hair.

50:59.122 --> 51:01.190
The room upsets you.

51:05.443 --> 51:07.363
You've torn your dress.

51:07.497 --> 51:11.987
Uh, yes. Yes, I wondered
if I might borrow some thread.

51:12.902 --> 51:14.370
Ah.

51:15.238 --> 51:16.773
I have an idea.

51:22.479 --> 51:24.147
Oh, no.

51:24.647 --> 51:27.951
- No, no, I... I couldn't.
- Wait.

51:28.051 --> 51:31.054
I can't... I really...
please, I really can't.

51:31.154 --> 51:34.353
Let's see. This? No.

51:40.430 --> 51:44.667
Try this on. See how it fits, huh?

52:14.430 --> 52:16.853
Brava. Sei bellissima.

52:17.333 --> 52:19.736
Ah, perfetto.

52:20.975 --> 52:22.668
Bellissima.

52:23.973 --> 52:26.403
I... I tore my dress... my skirt.

52:26.503 --> 52:29.346
- Take it off.
- Yes.

52:50.500 --> 52:51.901
No.

52:54.237 --> 52:55.672
No.

53:01.027 --> 53:02.845
Put it on.

53:26.636 --> 53:28.637
Put that one away.

55:22.185 --> 55:23.786
Signore.

55:26.119 --> 55:27.623
Please.

55:35.298 --> 55:37.734
I have something to ask.

55:39.402 --> 55:42.004
You may very likely refuse.

55:45.007 --> 55:46.812
What is it?

55:48.778 --> 55:50.847
I saw this afternoon...

55:50.947 --> 55:53.316
...something I had previously
failed to notice...

55:53.416 --> 55:57.476
...certain resemblances between you...

55:57.654 --> 56:00.727
...you and my wife. I...

56:05.027 --> 56:07.863
I think you know what it is I ask.

56:18.912 --> 56:23.752
If I have offended you, I apologize
and ask that we forget the matter entirely.

56:28.684 --> 56:32.721
Your work here will be unaffected.

57:30.112 --> 57:31.981
Look at yourself...

57:32.081 --> 57:33.882
...how beautiful you are.

58:50.206 --> 58:52.071
Your left leg forward.

58:56.766 --> 58:59.835
Your hand. Yes, your hand.

59:01.120 --> 59:03.134
Your head.

59:05.508 --> 59:08.977
This way, yes. Just a little more.

59:12.308 --> 59:14.046
Don't move.

01:01:03.125 --> 01:01:05.127
Bring them in.

01:01:19.508 --> 01:01:21.310
Bring them in.

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:46.996
Jakob.

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.008
Jakob.

01:03:03.278 --> 01:03:05.080
I'm here.

01:03:06.215 --> 01:03:08.049
I'm right here.

01:03:08.544 --> 01:03:10.085
Jakob.

01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:42.618
I'm going to look after you.

01:03:45.107 --> 01:03:46.989
I promise.

01:04:22.374 --> 01:04:24.242
You're hurting him now.

01:04:25.894 --> 01:04:27.729
Let me care for him.

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:31.900
Let me care for them both.

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:28.691
Oh.

01:06:15.237 --> 01:06:17.039
Is it her?

01:06:17.539 --> 01:06:19.375
Or is it me?

01:07:50.699 --> 01:07:52.768
You wanted to see me?

01:07:57.773 --> 01:08:00.909
I think it's time for us...

01:08:01.009 --> 01:08:06.583
...to review the progress of your work,
to discuss any changes in Jakob's behavior.

01:08:06.683 --> 01:08:08.503
He needs me.

01:08:10.652 --> 01:08:14.289
- I can help him.
- And yet he has still said nothing.

01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:19.294
It's for me to protect him,
and now I have made things worse.

01:08:27.341 --> 01:08:29.372
She wants me here...

01:08:30.671 --> 01:08:33.488
...to take care of Jakob and...

01:08:35.477 --> 01:08:37.745
...and to take care of you.

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.551
The voice is real.

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:03.004
You're mad.

01:09:05.439 --> 01:09:09.270
Yes. You said it yourself.
"Serious condition."

01:09:09.371 --> 01:09:11.180
- I should have paid closer attention.
- No!

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:14.515
Instead of helping Jakob,
you've made yourself unwell.

01:09:14.616 --> 01:09:16.798
- Now you hear whatever you wish!
- No.

01:09:16.898 --> 01:09:19.854
Yes. Why would she speak to you
and not to her husband?

01:09:19.955 --> 01:09:22.457
Please don't send me away. Please.

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:26.261
I must do what is best...

01:09:26.361 --> 01:09:29.631
...above all, for Jakob.

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:34.635
But...

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.045
Jakob! Jakob.

01:09:53.988 --> 01:09:56.257
He's going to send me away.

01:09:59.328 --> 01:10:01.329
Tell me what I must do.

01:10:02.748 --> 01:10:04.592
Tell me.

01:10:05.968 --> 01:10:07.802
Tell me.

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:16.277
Tell me.

01:10:17.679 --> 01:10:20.315
Tell me. Tell...

01:10:22.868 --> 01:10:24.669
Tell me.

01:10:26.271 --> 01:10:28.106
Tell me.

01:10:32.294 --> 01:10:34.029
Tell me.

01:10:37.966 --> 01:10:41.003
Tell me! Tell me!

01:10:42.942 --> 01:10:45.007
Tell me. Tell me.

01:10:45.107 --> 01:10:46.975
Tell me!

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:08.163
Jakob.

01:11:10.032 --> 01:11:11.666
Jakob.

01:11:14.336 --> 01:11:16.538
Another woman will come.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:20.809
This is how it must be.

01:11:27.182 --> 01:11:29.017
We must help her.

01:11:47.369 --> 01:11:51.239
Jakob. Jakob, listen to me closely.

01:11:52.174 --> 01:11:55.443
Your mother is watching over you.

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:58.914
But she is suffering.

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.749
And she is tired.

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:04.275
And she is trapped. Jakob...

01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:07.543
...we must help her. We must help her.

01:12:07.643 --> 01:12:09.724
You know what you must do.

01:12:10.392 --> 01:12:13.995
Jakob. Jakob. Jakob!

01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.174
Jakob! Stop!

01:12:39.554 --> 01:12:41.103
Jakob!

01:12:41.203 --> 01:12:42.708
Jakob!

01:12:47.646 --> 01:12:49.284
Stop, Jakob!

01:12:54.923 --> 01:12:57.840
Jakob, no. No, no, no.

01:12:57.940 --> 01:12:59.741
It's time.

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:01.809
It's time.

01:13:02.844 --> 01:13:04.913
You have to let her go.

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:06.949
No. Jakob!

01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:09.184
No, it has to be now.

01:13:09.284 --> 01:13:11.352
Do you understand?

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:16.458
He will send me away if you don't speak.

01:13:17.125 --> 01:13:18.926
Speak.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:21.897
Speak.

01:13:21.997 --> 01:13:25.467
Speak! Speak! Speak!

01:13:37.412 --> 01:13:40.189
Oh, no. No.

01:13:40.289 --> 01:13:41.880
No.

01:14:40.742 --> 01:14:43.845
Jakob. This is how it must be.

01:15:24.819 --> 01:15:27.120
- What are you doing?
- I must leave.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.862
- No.
- Sir, she's given me her illness.

01:15:30.962 --> 01:15:33.243
You have a fever. That is all.

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:37.399
You don't have to leave. I want you to stay.

01:15:37.499 --> 01:15:41.777
Forgive me. We've been under
her spell too long, not only Jakob...

01:15:41.877 --> 01:15:43.771
...all of us.

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:48.944
- I can't.
- No, Jakob needs you.

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:50.845
For him.

01:15:53.748 --> 01:15:55.550
I'm so afraid.

01:15:57.118 --> 01:15:59.954
Lilia, where is she?

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:02.958
- Who?
- Lilia.

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:04.936
What do you mean?

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.562
Where is she?

01:16:09.314 --> 01:16:10.822
She's dead.

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:14.736
On the day of Malvina's funeral,
she put stones in her pockets...

01:16:14.836 --> 01:16:16.904
...and walked into the lake.

01:16:29.024 --> 01:16:30.518
Verena.

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:36.257
Verena!

01:17:46.344 --> 01:17:48.379
Look at yourself.

01:18:19.427 --> 01:18:21.296
Not here.

01:18:22.697 --> 01:18:24.531
Not this room.

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:30.060
No. No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:34.326
Not this room.

01:18:36.811 --> 01:18:38.289
It's all right.

01:18:42.269 --> 01:18:45.118
Tutto. Tutto, tutto.

01:18:49.991 --> 01:18:51.760
The door was locked.

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:55.096
- It's for your safety.
- Please, Klaus, not this room.

01:18:55.196 --> 01:18:58.983
Alessio thinks it's best to confuse, confuse.

01:18:59.083 --> 01:19:00.585
Please don't leave me here.

01:19:00.735 --> 01:19:03.838
I'm going to fetch a doctor,
and he'll be here as soon as he can.

01:19:03.938 --> 01:19:07.742
Don't leave me here. Not this room.

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:10.812
I must speak to Jakob.

01:19:11.412 --> 01:19:14.248
I must speak to Jakob.

01:19:21.923 --> 01:19:23.457
Jakob.

01:19:27.812 --> 01:19:31.699
The boy will speak when the time is right.

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:35.269
Help me.

01:19:47.348 --> 01:19:48.949
Help.

01:20:02.797 --> 01:20:05.433
Help me.

01:20:25.921 --> 01:20:28.189
Oh, God, please.

01:21:46.734 --> 01:21:48.536
Good morning.

01:21:49.988 --> 01:21:51.826
You're feeling better?

01:21:58.412 --> 01:22:01.783
Everything's going to be fine.
I promise. Hmm.

01:22:01.883 --> 01:22:03.718
I was worried.

01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.294
Where is Jakob?

01:23:08.466 --> 01:23:10.535
I miss my mama.

01:23:13.955 --> 01:23:15.790
I'm here.

01:23:17.191 --> 01:23:19.059
I'm right here.

01:23:25.266 --> 01:23:26.894
Jakob.

01:23:49.724 --> 01:23:52.210
I try to think of a time before this.

01:23:54.078 --> 01:23:56.287
I hardly know the woman I see.

01:23:57.899 --> 01:24:02.040
But the past is a dream from which
we wake with each new morning.

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:12.213
We are, none of us, quite who we were.

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:38.973
Come, Jakob.

01:24:40.508 --> 01:24:42.397
Sit with me.
