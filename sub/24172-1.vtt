No, no, wait a minute,
kid, kid, kid...

01:44.861 --> 01:47.221
I forgot what
I was supposed to say,

01:47.261 --> 01:48.261
Y'know, like, uh...

01:48.341 --> 01:49.861
"The rain's good
for the farmers,"

01:49.941 --> 01:51.581
"Grow some crops,"
some shit like that.

01:51.661 --> 01:52.781
Mr. Burmeister?

01:52.901 --> 01:54.981
Yeah, Burmeister. Sit down.

01:58.701 --> 02:01.341
Oh, hey, I, uh --

02:01.421 --> 02:03.221
Pss-pss-pss-- later.

02:03.301 --> 02:04.221
Oh! Yeah.

02:04.341 --> 02:07.101
You're dealing with a professional here.

02:07.181 --> 02:08.300
Bingo.

02:08.300 --> 02:10.501
Hey, a man's
gotta do somethin'.

02:10.541 --> 02:12.301
Besides, it's
too early in the day

02:12.341 --> 02:13.421
to be chasin' pussy.

02:23.461 --> 02:25.541
Carl Harding. Sorry I'm late.

02:25.581 --> 02:26.941
It's your hour.

02:26.981 --> 02:28.261
50 minutes. But who's counting, right?

02:31.261 --> 02:33.541
So, Carl, why don't you --

02:33.621 --> 02:34.741
I'm sorry, before we begin,

02:34.781 --> 02:37.101
Um, please make sure that
the bills go to my office,

02:37.141 --> 02:38.381
not to my house.

02:38.501 --> 02:39.581
- Sure.
- Thank you.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.261
So why don't you
start at the beginning,

02:42.381 --> 02:44.861
and tell me why
you've come to see me.

02:44.901 --> 02:46.101
Right.

02:46.141 --> 02:48.541
You wanna hear about
my mom and my childhood,

02:48.541 --> 02:49.741
is that the kinda shit
you're looking for?

02:49.781 --> 02:51.461
If that's why you're here.

02:51.541 --> 02:52.221
No, it's not.

02:52.261 --> 02:53.381
What do I look like?

02:53.501 --> 02:54.861
Just to set
the record straight,

02:54.901 --> 02:56.101
I Just made partner

02:56.101 --> 02:57.581
at the second-largest law firm
in the state,

02:57.701 --> 02:58.661
so I'm doing very well, thank you.

02:58.701 --> 03:01.541
So I don't
mean to brag, but you asked.

03:01.661 --> 03:04.021
No I didn't.

03:04.021 --> 03:05.861
- Okay.

03:05.901 --> 03:08.541
So you're here because...?

03:08.541 --> 03:10.181
- I'm here because

03:10.221 --> 03:13.781
I've got this thing
going on with a woman --

03:13.821 --> 03:14.941
not my mom!

03:15.061 --> 03:16.781
It's not.

Come on.

03:38.221 --> 03:39.781
I hope this
is important, Charlie,

03:39.901 --> 03:41.581
I've got Junior choir practice
in twenty minutes.

03:41.701 --> 03:42.781
I need to talk.

03:42.861 --> 03:44.021
This won't keep till confession?

03:44.181 --> 03:45.981
I really need some help with this.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.741
Is it a woman?

03:59.541 --> 04:01.661
Charlie:
I'm so glad you could help me with this.

04:01.661 --> 04:03.021
I don't know what to do,

04:03.061 --> 04:04.781
I knew you'd help me
sort this out.

04:04.901 --> 04:06.461
I'm here for you, Charlie,
no matter what it is.

04:06.541 --> 04:08.061
Now, Just take your time,

04:08.101 --> 04:09.501
and tell me everything
about this woman.

04:09.621 --> 04:10.741
I got all day.

04:10.781 --> 04:13.821
I don't usually do
this sort of thing.

04:13.901 --> 04:14.821
Uh-huh.

04:14.901 --> 04:17.341
I've never done this before, y'know?

04:17.461 --> 04:18.581
That's okay, sweetie.

04:18.701 --> 04:20.661
You can start with the next game
on the green sheet.

04:20.741 --> 04:22.661
It's four-card crazy bingo.

04:22.781 --> 04:24.341
Ten dollars.

04:24.461 --> 04:25.701
Lemme get two cups of coffee, please.

04:25.741 --> 04:28.261
Oh, uh, yeah. Two cups for me, too.

04:28.341 --> 04:30.461
O-76...

04:31.901 --> 04:35.021
0-55, 0-5-5.

04:35.061 --> 04:36.821
Y-y-you gotta know, um...

04:36.901 --> 04:40.101
I got my reasons for doing this.

04:40.101 --> 04:41.261
Well, that's nice.

04:41.341 --> 04:42.781
- See, not too long ago,

04:42.901 --> 04:45.021
my life was goin' along Just fine.

04:45.101 --> 04:47.501
I was happy...

04:47.621 --> 04:49.181
Mm-hmm.

04:49.261 --> 04:51.021
Well, maybe I wasn't happy,

04:51.021 --> 04:52.901
but, y'know, I was content.

04:52.981 --> 04:55.901
I had a Job, I had friends...

04:56.021 --> 04:58.621
I had a house...

04:58.741 --> 05:00.221
I had everything but --

05:00.381 --> 05:02.021
That steady bang, huh?

05:03.181 --> 05:06.221
"She," the squeeze, the girlfriend --

05:06.261 --> 05:07.501
whatever you wanna call a chick.

05:07.581 --> 05:09.621
Yeah, right.

05:11.621 --> 05:13.501
And then I met her....

05:13.501 --> 05:16.661
This whole thing
started one night at McCool's

05:16.701 --> 05:20.141
The place was packed,
even my cousin Carl was there,

05:20.261 --> 05:21.901
and I was in the zone

05:22.021 --> 05:23.581
Everybody's got their power base --

05:23.701 --> 05:26.021
pouring drinks is my specialty

05:26.101 --> 05:27.461
I was puttin on quite a show

05:27.541 --> 05:29.741
for the frat boys
at the end of the bar

05:29.821 --> 05:31.301
Awright, who wants to take the plunge?

05:31.341 --> 05:33.341
I want it!

05:33.461 --> 05:36.261
Awright, I know
its only bartending,

05:36.301 --> 05:37.541
but hey,
I m good at it

05:37.581 --> 05:40.941
Randy: Awright, folks,
let's go, wrap it up.

05:41.021 --> 05:41.861
- What a setup!

05:42.021 --> 05:44.821
You must get laid
like... all the time.

05:44.901 --> 05:45.821
- Oh, yeah.

05:45.901 --> 05:48.421
The girls are
linin' up around the block.

05:48.541 --> 05:49.941
Fuck, I knew it!

05:50.021 --> 05:51.061
They Just can't resist a man

05:51.181 --> 05:52.501
working for tips in the service industry.

05:52.501 --> 05:54.541
Tell me!
Gimme, gimme, gimme...

05:54.581 --> 05:56.501
Y'know, Carl, I appreciate
your comin' down here

05:56.581 --> 05:57.701
and gettin' shit-faced drunk, but --

05:57.741 --> 05:58.741
Haaa!

05:58.741 --> 05:59.781
Don't you think it's about time

05:59.781 --> 06:02.501
you went home to Karen and the kids?

06:02.581 --> 06:03.981
Well, that would be a good idea,

06:04.021 --> 06:06.501
except they're
visiting Grandma in Ohio.

06:06.621 --> 06:08.061
What about that thing called a Job?

06:08.141 --> 06:11.101
You might wanna go home
and sober up for an hour or two

06:11.221 --> 06:12.621
before goin' in
and facing the partners

06:12.701 --> 06:15.101
of Do-We Cheat-Em And How.

06:15.221 --> 06:17.621
Close. You must mean
Ragsdale, Hersch & Klein.

06:17.701 --> 06:19.621
Take a card, young man,
because you never know.

06:19.701 --> 06:21.661
Oh! What are you
tryin' to do,

06:21.701 --> 06:22.941
you tryin' to
get rid of me?

06:23.021 --> 06:25.701
Hey! Let's go
to one of those after hours clubs.

06:25.781 --> 06:28.221
They got these long,
long- legged girls there,

06:28.261 --> 06:30.301
you can look at them
and maybe touch them.

06:30.421 --> 06:31.901
I gotta close up.

06:31.981 --> 06:33.061
You think Just 'cause I'm married

06:33.221 --> 06:34.621
I don't know about these places?

06:34.741 --> 06:36.101
Just because you are married

06:36.301 --> 06:37.901
means you're gettin' it
a whole lot more than me.

06:39.021 --> 06:40.501
That's a depressing thought.

06:40.621 --> 06:42.981
Carl, you need me
to call you a cab?

06:43.021 --> 06:44.581
Oh, no...

06:44.701 --> 06:45.941
you Just sobered me up pretty good.

06:46.021 --> 06:47.821
Get home safe.

06:48.781 --> 06:52.101
It had been
a fairly busy night

06:52.181 --> 06:54.021
so by the time
I closed the register

06:54.101 --> 06:55.701
and cleaned up the Joint,

06:55.741 --> 06:58.021
all I wanted to do
was go home

07:00.781 --> 07:03.101
Woman:
Where are you going?!

07:03.181 --> 07:04.581
Stop the car!

07:04.661 --> 07:05.901
Man:
Do you hear what I'm tellin' ya?!

07:05.941 --> 07:07.061
Don't touch me!

07:07.181 --> 07:08.661
Get over here!

07:08.741 --> 07:10.141
Let go of me!

07:10.221 --> 07:12.021
Hey!

07:12.821 --> 07:14.901
Awright, go!

07:28.261 --> 07:30.261
Driver:
Fuck you!

07:31.941 --> 07:34.261
And there she was...

07:38.501 --> 07:40.661
This is not the kind of girl

07:40.741 --> 07:43.621
you usually run into
In a dark alley

07:43.701 --> 07:47.021
In fact, this is not
the kind of girl

07:47.101 --> 07:49.181
I ever run into

07:51.421 --> 07:53.141
You okay?

07:53.261 --> 07:55.261
Girl: No, I'm not okay.

07:55.301 --> 07:58.221
Some smelly guy
Just tried to rape me.

07:58.261 --> 07:59.741
- What a Jerk! Here.

07:59.821 --> 08:02.101
You want me to
call the police?

08:02.181 --> 08:03.941
I-I know you're Just
trying to help,

08:04.021 --> 08:05.181
but spending
the rest of the night

08:05.261 --> 08:06.741
with a bunch of ass hole cops

08:06.861 --> 08:09.261
isn't exactly what I need right now.

08:09.381 --> 08:10.901
Your...

08:11.981 --> 08:13.621
Thanks.

08:18.661 --> 08:19.901
You got a smoke?

08:20.021 --> 08:21.741
Huh? No, sorry.

08:21.821 --> 08:23.621
This really is my night.

08:23.701 --> 08:25.701
I bet I could
find you one in the bar.

08:25.821 --> 08:26.901
It's okay.

08:27.021 --> 08:29.181
I'm tryin' to cut down anyway.

08:34.101 --> 08:36.701
You're gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.941
Okay, alright.
I'll see you around.

08:40.301 --> 08:41.381
Hey!

08:42.260 --> 08:44.381
What are you doin' right now?

08:44.421 --> 08:45.621
- Whaddya mean?

08:45.661 --> 08:46.661
Well, I mean, look,

08:46.741 --> 08:49.501
I Just had this little
unpleasant experience,

08:49.581 --> 08:52.261
and I don't especially
feel like being by myself.

08:52.381 --> 08:53.981
Right, right.

08:54.021 --> 08:56.501
Well, I was Just gonna go home.

08:56.541 --> 08:59.501
You got a stereo?

08:59.501 --> 09:01.461
Well, I got a boom box.

09:01.581 --> 09:04.061
Only one of the speakers
is workin', so...

09:04.181 --> 09:05.821
I don't know if
you call it a stereo.

09:05.861 --> 09:08.621
You wanna go
listen to some music?

09:09.221 --> 09:11.181
Where's your car?

09:11.261 --> 09:13.461
Actually, I Just live
a couple of blocks --

09:13.461 --> 09:16.021
Hun --no car.
- Sorry.

09:16.101 --> 09:17.381
Hey.

09:20.701 --> 09:24.061
So, do you live
in a house or an apartment?

09:28.541 --> 09:30.981
Well, this is it.

09:38.221 --> 09:39.781
You live here alone?

09:40.901 --> 09:43.501
It was my mother's before she died.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.221
You own it?

09:45.301 --> 09:47.141
Yeah.

09:49.061 --> 09:51.221
Oh, you're so lucky.

09:51.301 --> 09:53.661
I've always dreamt
of having my own place.

09:59.821 --> 10:01.661
I know what you're thinking --

10:01.741 --> 10:03.821
The police station
might be cheerier, huh?

10:03.861 --> 10:05.301
It's great.

10:05.421 --> 10:06.421
Yeah.

10:11.061 --> 10:12.741
Lot of potential.

10:12.861 --> 10:15.181
"A lot of potential."

10:15.261 --> 10:17.501
What is she,
a real estate agent?

10:17.541 --> 10:20.061
Can I get you something to drink?

10:20.061 --> 10:21.541
Uh, tap water,

10:21.661 --> 10:23.581
I got beer,

10:23.621 --> 10:25.861
I got tap water,

10:25.941 --> 10:27.221
I think I got...

10:27.301 --> 10:29.461
Uh...

10:29.541 --> 10:30.901
I may have a Yoo-Hoo.

10:30.981 --> 10:32.501
- Beer sounds good.

10:32.541 --> 10:35.261
I forgot. I drank
the last one this morning.

10:36.261 --> 10:38.941
Uh, I can make some tea

10:39.061 --> 10:40.461
or, uh, coffee...

10:40.581 --> 10:42.501
That's fine, thanks.

10:42.501 --> 10:44.661
Well, tea, anyway.

10:44.741 --> 10:46.701
Water's fine.
Maybe some ice?

10:46.741 --> 10:48.261
Water.

10:50.341 --> 10:51.741
Ah...

10:51.741 --> 10:53.981
Sorry, no, uh,

10:53.981 --> 10:55.301
no ice.

10:55.421 --> 10:57.501
My freezer's on the blink.

11:00.221 --> 11:01.661
How is it?

11:01.741 --> 11:02.701
What?

11:02.741 --> 11:03.581
The water.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.541
Fine.

11:10.661 --> 11:12.301
Do you like water?

11:12.421 --> 11:13.701
I love it.

11:13.741 --> 11:16.861
It's actually
my second favorite thing in the world.

11:16.861 --> 11:18.821
Really? And what's
your first favorite?

11:18.861 --> 11:20.261
Fucking.

11:35.741 --> 11:37.181
What?!

11:37.981 --> 11:40.261
It's my mom's room.

A woman after
my own heart -- heh-heh.

12:30.621 --> 12:32.181
Hun-hun.

12:33.821 --> 12:36.661
You have no idea
what this woman is capable of.

12:36.741 --> 12:39.421
I guess you don't have to
worry about that anymore,

12:39.461 --> 12:41.061
do you?

12:41.101 --> 12:42.901
I don't think of myself
as the kind of person

12:42.981 --> 12:44.421
who's in this kind of office.

12:44.541 --> 12:47.061
When I think about people
who are in therapy,

12:47.181 --> 12:50.581
these are people who don't
have their lives in control.

12:50.661 --> 12:53.221
I am --
I'm in control of my life,

12:53.341 --> 12:55.101
my life is-is in control,

12:55.221 --> 12:56.981
that is not a problem for me.

12:57.061 --> 12:59.181
What about the woman
you mentioned?

12:59.221 --> 13:02.501
Right. Uh...

13:05.021 --> 13:09.461
It started
one night at McCool's...

13:09.461 --> 13:12.221
Its a kind of
a low-rent Joint

13:12.221 --> 13:14.181
Ordinarily I would
never be seen dead

13:14.221 --> 13:15.981
in a place like this

13:16.021 --> 13:18.741
Hey! Who wants to take the plunge?

13:18.821 --> 13:21.021
But on this particular night,

13:21.101 --> 13:24.661
Karen had taken the kids
to Ohio to visit her mom

13:24.741 --> 13:26.461
So I decided to
dropin on my cousin,

13:26.461 --> 13:28.701
who I hadn't seen
in a long time

13:28.821 --> 13:30.221
We re talking about

13:30.221 --> 13:31.781
an adult
who thinks it's fun

13:31.861 --> 13:33.701
to drink out of
a toilet plunger.

13:33.821 --> 13:36.461
I mean, this is
the mentality we're dealing with here.

13:36.541 --> 13:38.261
Let's Just stay focused
on the woman, okay?

13:38.421 --> 13:40.061
Right.

13:40.101 --> 13:41.781
The woman, okay

13:41.861 --> 13:43.821
Well, I look across the room

13:43.901 --> 13:45.941
and I saw

13:53.221 --> 13:54.821
...a very beautiful woman.

13:57.901 --> 13:59.901
I hung around
hoping shed come back,

13:59.981 --> 14:01.021
but she didn t

14:01.141 --> 14:03.061
Okay, time for me to go.

14:03.181 --> 14:05.461
It was pretty late,

14:05.461 --> 14:07.861
and I d had a few drinks

14:09.861 --> 14:11.821
And there she was

14:11.941 --> 14:13.661
Girl:
I'm Just a little bit nervous.

14:13.741 --> 14:15.021
How do I look?

14:15.101 --> 14:16.581
She was with this guy,

14:16.661 --> 14:18.341
and I thought maybe
this is not the best time

14:18.341 --> 14:20.301
to hit on
this particular woman

14:20.421 --> 14:21.941
What is this,
PMS week?

14:22.021 --> 14:24.901
So I got in my car and

14:24.981 --> 14:27.501
I don't know, I started
to doze off a little,

14:27.581 --> 14:29.741
and I hear all this
screaming and cursing.

14:29.781 --> 14:32.661
Girl:
Don't touch me, asshole!

14:32.701 --> 14:34.061
I'm gettin' out!

14:34.181 --> 14:36.101
Bartender:
Hey!

14:47.821 --> 14:49.021
Wow.

14:52.221 --> 14:53.341
Tits.

14:53.461 --> 14:54.461
Driver:
Fuck you!

14:54.581 --> 14:56.221
Therapist:
And you didn't try to help?

14:56.221 --> 14:57.461
Oh, I would have.

14:57.581 --> 14:58.981
But?

15:00.341 --> 15:01.661
I may have fallen asleep.

15:01.741 --> 15:03.341
You should know --

15:03.461 --> 15:05.581
I was practically
forced into this.

15:05.621 --> 15:07.221
Bartender:
Jewel?

15:09.541 --> 15:11.221
Jewel?

15:16.021 --> 15:17.661
I, uh...

15:17.781 --> 15:19.461
I suppose
it's not gonna help

15:19.581 --> 15:21.621
If i tell you
that was really amazing?

15:21.701 --> 15:23.421
I know it was.

15:23.461 --> 15:25.101
That's the problem.

15:27.061 --> 15:30.101
To tell ya the truth...

15:30.141 --> 15:33.021
I only took
one psychology course

15:33.061 --> 15:35.021
in Junior college,

15:35.141 --> 15:37.221
I know there's
supposed to be this thing

15:37.261 --> 15:41.781
where you're sad
or you're guilty after...

15:41.821 --> 15:44.181
Well, I personally
don't suffer from that.

15:44.301 --> 15:46.221
It's not that.

15:46.301 --> 15:47.701
Don't you see?

15:47.821 --> 15:49.821
That guy tonight --

15:49.861 --> 15:51.981
Oh -- oh, that creep
in the firebird?

15:52.101 --> 15:54.261
I know that guy.

15:54.381 --> 15:55.981
Of course
you know the guy.

15:56.021 --> 15:57.821
Let's face it,
you're not the type of girl

15:57.981 --> 16:00.701
who Just Jumps into a car
with some smelly guy

16:00.861 --> 16:02.421
that you don't even know,

16:02.461 --> 16:04.101
I know that.

16:04.221 --> 16:05.501
No....

16:05.621 --> 16:07.701
He and I are...

16:07.781 --> 16:09.461
doing this...

16:09.581 --> 16:10.701
thing.

16:10.821 --> 16:14.141
Oh, shit, I really like you.

16:14.221 --> 16:16.021
What do you mean by "thing"?

16:16.061 --> 16:19.381
He and I get in this fight,

16:19.461 --> 16:22.621
and then you or whoever

16:22.661 --> 16:24.581
comes to my rescue

16:24.661 --> 16:27.461
and takes me home, and then...

16:27.621 --> 16:31.061
He like shows up
and we rob you.

16:31.221 --> 16:32.141
What?

16:32.261 --> 16:35.101
We rob you.

16:35.221 --> 16:36.941
I mean, do you believe that?

16:37.021 --> 16:39.701
I'm shocked.

16:39.701 --> 16:41.221
I-I take it this is

16:41.341 --> 16:43.181
something that
you-you've done before?

16:43.181 --> 16:45.021
Just a couple of times.

16:45.101 --> 16:46.741
I know it sounds sick,

16:46.781 --> 16:48.821
but you don't know Utah, he's nuts.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.341
How does he know
where we are, anyway?

16:51.461 --> 16:53.461
I'm supposed to
call him and tell him.

16:53.461 --> 16:56.221
You-you haven't
done that yet, have you?

16:56.221 --> 16:58.461
Of course not!

16:58.461 --> 16:59.581
Oh, good.

16:59.621 --> 17:01.421
Good...

17:01.501 --> 17:03.421
Um... okay.

17:03.541 --> 17:05.381
I got it.

17:05.421 --> 17:06.661
Don't call him.

17:08.221 --> 17:10.181
Let's call the police instead.

17:12.221 --> 17:15.300
Not if you ever
want to see me again.

17:16.661 --> 17:17.941
Oh, right.

17:17.981 --> 17:19.501
Y'know, I generally

17:19.580 --> 17:22.461
think better
with my shoes on, so...

17:27.981 --> 17:30.581
This guy Utah,
is he a mormon?

17:30.621 --> 17:32.821
Uh, I wouldn't say that.

17:32.901 --> 17:34.701
Oh. I didn't think so.

17:36.701 --> 17:40.021
You know, this guy...

17:40.021 --> 17:42.821
He sounds like
a ma Jor piece of shit, you know?

17:42.861 --> 17:43.981
You wouldn't be
talkin' about me,

17:44.021 --> 17:45.941
would ya, loverboy?

17:48.981 --> 17:50.341
Wh-why didn't you call?

17:50.461 --> 17:52.381
I was Just about to.

17:52.461 --> 17:55.581
Has this guy
got anything worth takin'?

17:55.661 --> 17:58.021
Old TV, a VCR.

17:58.061 --> 17:59.021
He's got a boom box,

17:59.061 --> 18:00.661
but only one speaker works.

18:00.701 --> 18:02.421
A Mr. Coffee machine.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.181
Telephone, um...

18:04.181 --> 18:07.381
Oh yeah, and one light
hooked up to the clapper.

18:10.981 --> 18:12.341
Hey, that was my mom's.

18:12.381 --> 18:14.141
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

18:14.181 --> 18:17.221
You stand there,
you call me a piece of shit!

18:17.341 --> 18:20.141
Huh? I'm the piece of shit?

18:20.181 --> 18:23.581
I'm here with my lady,
you understand?

18:23.661 --> 18:25.941
It is a touchy situation!

18:27.221 --> 18:28.341
Has he got a car?

18:28.381 --> 18:29.461
No.

18:29.501 --> 18:30.621
No?

18:30.701 --> 18:32.621
He's pathetic!

18:32.741 --> 18:35.061
You-you don't
got a car?

18:35.181 --> 18:36.981
Everybody's
got a car today --

18:37.141 --> 18:40.701
Even bums don't
not got a car!

18:40.741 --> 18:42.421
What do you do when
you take a chick out,

18:42.421 --> 18:43.541
you go on a bus?

18:43.661 --> 18:45.821
Think you're gonna
get laid on a bus?

18:45.901 --> 18:47.101
Think you're gonna
give some chick

18:47.141 --> 18:49.141
the fuckin' monster on a bus?

18:49.221 --> 18:50.701
Huh?

18:52.021 --> 18:54.661
I got a car...

18:54.701 --> 18:56.821
The "piece of shit's" got a car!

18:58.181 --> 18:59.661
What about Jewelry,
has he got Jewelry?

18:59.781 --> 19:01.581
Just a Swatch

19:01.661 --> 19:04.101
Nice leather band, though.

19:04.181 --> 19:07.021
Oh yeah?
Take it off.

19:10.981 --> 19:12.941
C'mon, you're so slow.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.981
It's right over here.

19:15.101 --> 19:17.581
Awright, you're up,
slugger, let's go.

19:17.661 --> 19:18.941
You want me to open it?

19:19.021 --> 19:21.101
No, I want you
to dance with it --

19:21.181 --> 19:22.461
Move!

19:22.501 --> 19:23.621
Okay.

19:23.701 --> 19:26.181
And if there's
a gun in there, Just leave it.

19:26.181 --> 19:27.701
'Cause you'll
pull it out, you'll get nervous,

19:27.781 --> 19:29.621
you'll wind up miss in' me,

19:29.621 --> 19:32.141
then I gotta do
what I gotta do with what I got.

19:32.141 --> 19:33.181
Look at me.

19:33.221 --> 19:35.501
Look at me
when I talk to you!

19:35.581 --> 19:37.781
I can't look at you
and look at the safe at the same time.

19:37.781 --> 19:39.621
Oh, excuse me, okay.

19:39.701 --> 19:42.421
You're the big-shot now,
I'm nobody, right?

19:42.501 --> 19:44.941
Okay, I'm over here now.

19:45.621 --> 19:47.381
Excuse me.

19:48.341 --> 19:51.581
Got any other features
on this watch?

19:52.621 --> 19:53.941
It's got a stopwatch.

19:53.941 --> 19:55.221
It's got a stopwatch?

19:55.261 --> 19:57.021
I never figured out
how to use it.

19:57.141 --> 19:58.781
It's simple,
it's this button --

20:09.501 --> 20:10.941
Oh....

20:26.781 --> 20:28.061
What happened?

20:28.181 --> 20:30.181
He was gonna kill you.

20:31.381 --> 20:32.781
Really?

20:32.861 --> 20:34.741
I mean,
he was Just --

20:34.821 --> 20:36.301
He could definitely
tell that there was

20:36.381 --> 20:38.021
something going on
between us, y'know?

20:38.061 --> 20:39.261
How?

20:39.381 --> 20:41.181
Because I've never
actually slept with

20:41.181 --> 20:43.221
any of the other guys
that I've done this with before,

20:43.221 --> 20:44.461
that's how.

20:45.701 --> 20:47.461
Is he dead?

20:48.581 --> 20:50.981
Oh, Jesus.

20:53.941 --> 20:55.261
Do you hate me now?

20:55.381 --> 20:56.501
No, no, no, no.

20:56.621 --> 20:57.621
No.

20:57.621 --> 20:59.181
Oh yes, you do!

20:59.221 --> 21:01.541
No, it's not that, okay?

21:01.581 --> 21:03.621
It's Just the sex
and the violence

21:03.661 --> 21:06.061
all in one night,
it's a little much.

21:07.421 --> 21:09.621
- What are we gonna do now?
- What?

21:09.621 --> 21:11.061
- What are we gonna do now?!
- I don't know!

21:11.141 --> 21:12.981
Well, think of something!

21:13.981 --> 21:15.181
Let's call the police.

21:15.301 --> 21:16.901
That's a good idea.

21:16.981 --> 21:18.421
- Yeah?
- Yeah, really.

21:18.421 --> 21:20.181
And what are we
gonna tell 'em?

21:20.181 --> 21:21.941
We'll tell them
the truth,

21:22.021 --> 21:23.381
I mean, that
he was robbing you

21:23.421 --> 21:25.341
and-and I shot him,
and that's that.

21:25.421 --> 21:26.421
Yeah.

21:26.581 --> 21:28.421
Tell 'em the truth.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.741
I like that.

21:29.781 --> 21:32.661
Uh, since he was
threatening you,

21:32.781 --> 21:34.821
I probably
won't get more than ten years, right?

21:34.861 --> 21:36.461
And with good behavior

21:36.621 --> 21:40.621
-- I could be out in seven... years.

21:44.381 --> 21:46.381
Wait...

21:47.501 --> 21:49.141
Um...

21:50.261 --> 21:53.181
- Let's come up with another plan.
- What?

21:53.221 --> 21:54.941
I mean, that he
was robbing you

21:54.981 --> 21:56.981
and somebody else shot him?
Who?

21:57.101 --> 21:59.261
Well, we could say
that I shot him.

21:59.381 --> 22:01.061
That won't work.

22:01.181 --> 22:04.301
It's ridiculous,
it would never work that way, it's--

22:04.341 --> 22:06.981
Well, maybe...

22:11.141 --> 22:13.221
Well, I mean, let's...

22:13.341 --> 22:14.861
Let's go over it.

22:14.901 --> 22:15.941
Okay.

22:16.021 --> 22:17.941
- He was robbing the place.
- Yes.

22:17.981 --> 22:20.141
- He did get shot, right?
- Mm-hmm.

22:20.221 --> 22:22.061
So that's
two out of three.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.781
What's that,
that's sixty-seven percent true,

22:24.901 --> 22:27.941
I mean, that's
pretty good these days, right?

22:27.981 --> 22:29.501
Right.

22:36.141 --> 22:39.061
That's some first date,
killin' her boyfriend.

22:39.181 --> 22:42.701
Well, it gave
the relationship a certain intensity.

22:45.981 --> 22:49.821
Charlie:
It all started one night at McCool's

22:49.941 --> 22:51.661
Earl Raymond Pitts.

22:51.741 --> 22:54.541
Had a list of priors
goin' back to the womb.

22:54.621 --> 22:55.781
Seriously.

22:55.861 --> 22:58.421
He was born in
Dwight Correctional.

22:58.421 --> 23:00.621
His mother had twins
while she was doin' a bit for narcotics.

23:00.661 --> 23:01.901
You mean
there's another one out there like him?

23:01.981 --> 23:03.661
Huh. Yeah.

23:03.661 --> 23:05.181
He went by the name "Utah."

23:05.181 --> 23:07.461
"Utah" ...
The Mormon State?

23:07.541 --> 23:08.861
Yeah. Don't ask me.

23:14.301 --> 23:16.301
I'm a little unclear on this.

23:16.421 --> 23:17.741
He was holding
a gun on you,

23:17.781 --> 23:19.341
But you were able
to get your gun

23:19.421 --> 23:22.101
and shoot him point-blank
in the back of the head?

23:22.181 --> 23:23.461
Yeah, right.

23:23.541 --> 23:25.701
It-it all happened
kinda fast.

23:25.701 --> 23:27.181
So...

23:27.181 --> 23:29.221
he was standing
in front of you,

23:29.301 --> 23:32.061
and then... what?

23:32.181 --> 23:33.061
He heard something?

23:33.181 --> 23:34.421
Right.

23:34.541 --> 23:37.301
He turned around,
you grabbed your gun...

23:37.381 --> 23:38.861
Right.

23:38.941 --> 23:39.981
Which was where?

23:40.021 --> 23:41.141
Uh...

23:41.141 --> 23:43.181
- Hidden next to the safe?
- Right.

23:43.181 --> 23:45.461
Just in case
something like this ever happened.

23:45.581 --> 23:47.981
He turned around,
you grabbed your gun, and pow!

23:48.141 --> 23:50.901
Exactly --
that's exactly how it happened.

23:56.181 --> 23:57.901
About what time was this?

23:57.981 --> 23:59.181
Huh?

23:59.261 --> 24:00.421
About what time
was this?

24:00.501 --> 24:02.341
Oh, uh...

24:03.381 --> 24:06.181
Just before I called 911.

24:06.181 --> 24:08.221
Thanks.

24:10.421 --> 24:11.501
Hey.

24:12.661 --> 24:14.941
It's responsible citizens
Just like yourself

24:14.981 --> 24:17.101
that make my Job
a lot easier.

24:22.181 --> 24:24.461
You can imagine my mood,

24:24.541 --> 24:26.261
getting roused
from a sound sleep

24:26.381 --> 24:29.141
to go scoop some citizen
off a barroom floor

24:29.221 --> 24:30.781
- You wanna talk to the lady?
- What lady?

24:30.821 --> 24:32.501
His.

24:32.621 --> 24:34.701
Does she have
anything to do with it?

24:34.781 --> 24:36.701
Nah, she was
waitin' for him back at their house,

24:36.701 --> 24:37.941
he didn't show,
she got worried,

24:37.941 --> 24:39.661
came here
lookin' for him.

24:39.741 --> 24:41.221
Let her go.

24:41.341 --> 24:42.541
Awright.

24:42.621 --> 24:43.981
You're free
to go, miss.

24:47.821 --> 24:51.261
Suddenly
my whole life changed

24:54.661 --> 24:58.661
Like Theresa had
come back from the dead

25:02.661 --> 25:05.221
She even looks
a little like Theresa.

25:06.541 --> 25:08.821
So this girl,
she's good in the sack, huh?

25:08.901 --> 25:10.661
I'm sorry, man,
you get my age,

25:10.741 --> 25:12.661
you like to hear
about the old un!

25:12.701 --> 25:13.941
Sorry.

25:14.021 --> 25:16.541
- O-18, 1-8 under the "O".

25:16.621 --> 25:18.821
Nice ass?

25:20.661 --> 25:22.981
Mr. Chick Fife,
telephone call.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.661
Mr. Chick Fife, please
call your cardiologist.

25:25.741 --> 25:27.781
You takin' the rap
for the shooting

25:27.861 --> 25:29.541
musta worked out okay.

25:29.581 --> 25:32.301
Your boss, he musta
treated you like a hero.

25:34.941 --> 25:37.181
Oh, kid....

25:37.181 --> 25:39.701
Death and good times,

25:39.781 --> 25:41.461
they don't mix.

25:41.501 --> 25:43.541
I can't have people
comin' in here

25:43.581 --> 25:44.781
lookin' for a good time,

25:44.821 --> 25:46.021
seein' you and thinkin',

25:46.141 --> 25:47.541
"uh-oh, that's the one

25:47.621 --> 25:48.901
"that put a bullet
in the guy's head.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.461
"Maybe he's gonna serve me

25:50.581 --> 25:51.941
"my strawberry daiquiri
and onion rings,

25:52.021 --> 25:54.541
"or maybe he's gonna
go postal on my ass!"

25:54.541 --> 25:56.581
Joey, the guy was
tryin' to rob your bar.

25:56.661 --> 25:58.101
He didn't take nothin'!

25:58.181 --> 25:59.901
You put a bullet
in his friggin' noggin!

25:59.981 --> 26:01.141
You're gone! Go!

26:03.621 --> 26:05.421
Hello!

26:05.581 --> 26:07.661
Wh-what are you doin'?

26:07.701 --> 26:10.181
What does it look like?
I'm ironing.

26:11.541 --> 26:13.901
We're not there yet, are we?

26:13.941 --> 26:15.341
What do you mean
we're not there yet?

26:15.341 --> 26:17.901
We're movin' a little fast here, Jewel.

26:17.941 --> 26:20.181
- Yeah?
- Hi, how ya doin'. Need your signature.

26:20.221 --> 26:22.821
- What's this?
- 1-800-Mattress.

26:22.901 --> 26:25.061
I didn't order
any mattress.

26:28.661 --> 26:30.381
Dammit!

26:31.421 --> 26:34.581
How are we supposed
to pay for this stuff?!

26:34.661 --> 26:35.741
Jewel:
God, Randy, I Just thought

26:35.941 --> 26:37.341
we really had something,

26:37.461 --> 26:39.341
or at least the start of something.

26:39.381 --> 26:41.301
But obviously
I'm incredibly stupid.

26:41.421 --> 26:42.581
You're not stupid.

26:42.661 --> 26:44.341
I'll be out of your life
in Just a few minutes.

26:44.381 --> 26:46.021
I didn't say
I wanted you out of my life.

26:46.061 --> 26:47.181
Ha!

26:47.981 --> 26:49.461
It's Just... with the ironing,

26:49.581 --> 26:50.461
the-the new mattress,

26:50.581 --> 26:52.061
they all Just
seem like things

26:52.061 --> 26:53.581
that are a little further
down the line,

26:53.581 --> 26:54.981
that's all.

26:55.021 --> 26:56.381
Further
down the line

26:56.461 --> 26:58.661
than all the sex
we've been having?

27:00.261 --> 27:03.181
Any further down the line
than killing Utah together?

27:03.301 --> 27:05.661
You're right...

27:05.781 --> 27:07.621
you know what, it's me.

27:07.621 --> 27:09.181
I lost my Job today.

27:12.221 --> 27:13.061
You what?

27:13.181 --> 27:14.541
I got canned.

27:14.581 --> 27:19.301
Oh, baby,
why didn't you say so?

27:19.421 --> 27:22.021
Aw...
are you okay?

27:22.101 --> 27:23.581
I guess.

27:23.621 --> 27:25.301
Oh....

27:28.901 --> 27:31.461
Mmm....

27:31.541 --> 27:33.141
Oh, your cousin called.

27:33.261 --> 27:35.021
The lawyer.

27:35.061 --> 27:37.221
We're going over
to his house on Saturday

27:37.341 --> 27:39.341
for a barbecue.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.781
So Carl invites me
over to his house for a barbecue.

27:43.901 --> 27:45.621
Now, Carl never
invites me over,

27:45.701 --> 27:47.781
so I'm thinkin'
to myself, why now?

27:54.661 --> 27:56.141
Here you go.

27:56.141 --> 27:56.741
That's sweet.

27:56.861 --> 27:58.341
Thanks.

27:58.341 --> 28:00.381
That is some
ma Jor league pussy.

28:00.501 --> 28:01.701
Ha ha ha!

28:01.821 --> 28:03.421
I meant that
in a good way.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.581
You bangin' her?

28:05.661 --> 28:07.621
She must have
fucked you senseless

28:07.701 --> 28:09.341
when she found out
you shot a guy?

28:09.421 --> 28:12.301
Because I read that
women cream for the violence.

28:12.301 --> 28:13.741
I don't know
what that is.

28:13.781 --> 28:15.941
When you're fuckin' her, though,
because she's so young, is it --

28:16.101 --> 28:17.821
I'm gonna see if
they want some helpin the kitchen.

28:17.861 --> 28:18.821
I'm Just asking.

28:18.861 --> 28:20.141
I mean, look at her!

28:20.261 --> 28:22.021
It's like havin'
a porn star in my house!

28:22.061 --> 28:23.861
Except she's
makin' salad.

28:23.941 --> 28:25.901
You have such
a beautiful house -- it's so homey.

28:25.901 --> 28:27.821
That's all Karen,
believe me.

28:27.901 --> 28:30.421
I wanted to go with
lots of stainless steel,

28:30.421 --> 28:31.781
something we could Just
pssh! Hose it right off.

28:31.821 --> 28:32.941
A lot of this stuff
we don't even use,

28:33.021 --> 28:34.701
so if you really
like it, take it.

28:34.741 --> 28:36.141
Thank you, Jewel.

28:36.221 --> 28:39.381
It's always been my dream
to have a real nice house.

28:39.461 --> 28:41.541
I already know exactly
what it'll look like --

28:41.661 --> 28:44.381
Wall-to-wall carpeting
with matching drapes,

28:44.461 --> 28:47.261
and a big, fluffy white couch,

28:47.341 --> 28:49.381
nice dining room set,

28:49.501 --> 28:51.901
and in the corner...

28:51.981 --> 28:53.581
a fountain.

28:59.021 --> 29:00.061
A fountain?

29:00.141 --> 29:01.381
It's gonna be...

29:01.501 --> 29:02.421
It's gonna be great.

29:02.541 --> 29:05.341
It's of a little girl
washing her hair

29:05.381 --> 29:07.621
and the water runs off
into a giant sea shell

29:07.621 --> 29:09.701
with goldfish
swimming in it.

29:11.141 --> 29:13.781
I didn't Just make it up,
I saw it in a magazine.

29:13.901 --> 29:15.101
Better Homes
and Fountains?

29:15.141 --> 29:16.341
Carl!

29:16.381 --> 29:18.701
Hey, Randy, you got a fountain
in your place, don't ya?

29:18.781 --> 29:19.701
In the living room --

29:19.781 --> 29:22.061
Oh no, that's
a leaky toilet.

29:22.141 --> 29:23.541
My mistake.

29:23.541 --> 29:25.701
You know what, Carl?
You're not funny -- Just rude.

29:25.781 --> 29:28.141
- Let's get together some time.
- That's a good idea.

29:28.181 --> 29:29.261
Bye.
Hey, c'mon.

29:29.381 --> 29:31.381
Mmm....

29:31.381 --> 29:34.981
Okay, okay!
Ha ha ha!

29:35.101 --> 29:36.141
Okay.

29:37.341 --> 29:39.301
Why don't you
let Carl run you home?

29:39.381 --> 29:41.581
No, I'm afraid
that's where your luck runs out.

29:41.581 --> 29:43.821
I can't drive,
I've been drinkin'.

29:43.941 --> 29:45.541
Would you
buy a car?

29:45.661 --> 29:46.821
One of these days.

29:46.941 --> 29:48.701
Make him
buy a car, would ya?

29:48.741 --> 29:49.861
Let's go catch
that 4:15 bus,

29:49.861 --> 29:51.421
Let's get
the hell out of here.

29:51.541 --> 29:53.341
Randy:
Buy a car --

29:53.381 --> 29:55.541
I wish he hadn t
put that idea in her head

30:01.381 --> 30:03.141
What's this?

30:03.141 --> 30:06.621
Oh, a friend of mine's
goin' away for a little while...

30:08.901 --> 30:10.701
So she said
I could borrow it.

30:10.741 --> 30:13.141
Well, what happens
when your friend gets back?

30:13.141 --> 30:14.941
We're gonna be used
to havin' a car by then.

30:15.021 --> 30:16.061
So?

30:16.141 --> 30:17.861
- Then we're gonna have to buy one.
- So?

30:17.941 --> 30:19.941
It's a bottomless pit
of expenses!

30:20.061 --> 30:23.181
You got insurance,
you got repairs, car payments--

30:23.301 --> 30:25.061
You're Just afraid
because now you don't

30:25.141 --> 30:27.741
have an excuse
for not finding work, aren't you?

30:27.821 --> 30:30.221
Stop right there,
this has nothing to do with work.

30:30.261 --> 30:31.141
Did you know
it's safer to fly

30:31.261 --> 30:32.741
than it is
to drive a car?

30:32.741 --> 30:34.181
You're upset with me

30:34.301 --> 30:35.941
Because I didn't
bring you home a plane?

30:35.941 --> 30:37.581
Another thing, if you think

30:37.581 --> 30:38.821
I'm gonna be out there

30:38.861 --> 30:40.341
with a hose and a bucket of suds

30:40.381 --> 30:42.301
to wash the damn thing,
you can forget it -- I'm not that guy.

30:42.301 --> 30:44.661
Well, fine.
I'll wash the car.

30:44.661 --> 30:46.221
God, you're
full of shit.

30:46.261 --> 30:47.901
What's that?
I'm full of shit?

30:47.941 --> 30:49.141
Yes.

30:49.261 --> 30:50.501
Lemme tell ya --
I have seen people

30:50.541 --> 30:52.581
leave the bar so drunk
they can't even see,

30:52.621 --> 30:53.821
and off they speed

30:53.861 --> 30:55.541
in their giant
sports utility vehicles.

30:55.661 --> 30:57.941
Well, you run into
one of these guys out on the street,

30:58.061 --> 31:00.541
and you're gonna die,
and you're gonna die ugly!

31:00.621 --> 31:02.341
Would you relax?

31:03.901 --> 31:06.061
Christ, look at this house!

31:09.581 --> 31:11.941
Uh... I come at
a bad time?

31:12.061 --> 31:13.341
Uh, no.

31:14.501 --> 31:16.981
Randy:
And then that damn detective dropped in

31:17.101 --> 31:19.501
As if i wasn t
stressed-out enough

31:19.581 --> 31:20.621
I'll let you two talk.

31:20.741 --> 31:22.101
What'd he want?

31:22.221 --> 31:24.501
Oh, you know, he's a cop.

31:24.581 --> 31:26.701
They're never satisfied

31:26.741 --> 31:28.661
unless they ask you
everything ten times.

31:28.781 --> 31:31.301
After that night at McCool's
I was a mess.

31:31.301 --> 31:34.101
I couldn't concentrate...

31:34.181 --> 31:36.581
I couldn't sleep...

31:36.621 --> 31:38.541
I could barely eat.

31:38.541 --> 31:41.581
Nothin' deep-fried, anyway.

31:41.581 --> 31:43.301
I had this longing...

31:43.421 --> 31:47.741
Something inside of me said
I had to see that woman again

31:51.741 --> 31:55.301
Boy, was I glad I got there
at that exact moment

31:55.301 --> 31:57.581
He was getting very abusive

31:57.621 --> 32:00.741
You're gonna die,
and you're gonna die ugly!

32:00.781 --> 32:04.821
It was like I had been chosen
for a very special assignment

32:04.941 --> 32:08.821
Not by the department,
but by a higher power

32:08.861 --> 32:11.861
I was being sent
to save her from him

32:11.901 --> 32:13.621
Oh...

32:13.741 --> 32:16.221
Did I... come at a bad time?

32:16.301 --> 32:17.821
Uh, no.

32:19.141 --> 32:20.861
Didn't seem possible,

32:20.941 --> 32:24.621
but she was even more beautiful
than the night I first saw her.

32:24.701 --> 32:27.541
And I said, Good afternoon,

32:27.661 --> 32:31.541
then she said,
I'll let you two talk

32:31.621 --> 32:33.341
Then he said --

32:33.341 --> 32:34.821
Not bad, huh?

32:34.901 --> 32:37.541
There was something about him
I Just didn't like.

32:37.541 --> 32:38.541
According to your statement,

32:38.541 --> 32:40.501
you closed the bar at one-thirty.

32:40.581 --> 32:42.741
You didn't call
to report the shooting

32:42.861 --> 32:44.341
until three-fifty-eight.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.381
I need to know what you were doing during
that time frame.

32:46.501 --> 32:49.061
Haven't we already
gone over all this stuff, man?

32:49.101 --> 32:51.301
Hey, uh, Jewel, how about

32:51.301 --> 32:53.541
crackin' me open a brew, huh?

32:53.541 --> 32:54.981
I don't know, it was, uh,

32:55.021 --> 32:56.941
I had to count all that money,

32:56.941 --> 32:59.101
It was a busy-ass night, awright?

32:59.101 --> 33:00.341
I think on this night

33:00.421 --> 33:01.941
we had those frat boys in there,

33:02.061 --> 33:03.381
and a couple of 'em --

33:03.461 --> 33:05.261
Whoa, whoa -- whaddya doin'?

33:05.301 --> 33:06.541
This guy's a cop.

33:06.701 --> 33:08.301
He can't drink,
he's on the Job!

33:08.381 --> 33:10.861
Why don't ya do somethin',
y'know, make yourself useful.

33:10.901 --> 33:12.381
All right.

33:12.381 --> 33:14.301
I'll be outside --
washing the car.

33:14.421 --> 33:15.741
Yeah, you do that.

33:16.861 --> 33:19.061
Man, I'm sorry about her.

33:21.341 --> 33:24.261
How can I not
question our Creator

33:24.381 --> 33:27.021
for putting this...

33:27.021 --> 33:30.261
...human obscenity
into the presence

33:30.381 --> 33:32.861
of such a...

33:32.981 --> 33:34.901
...divine creature.

33:35.021 --> 33:37.981
Anyway, that was the night
we had all these frat boys in

33:38.021 --> 33:39.821
and they're
taking "the plunge."

33:39.861 --> 33:41.981
A couple of 'em
ended up in the bathroom

33:42.101 --> 33:44.541
and barfin' up
all over the floor...

33:44.581 --> 33:48.341
I wasn't listening
to a word he was saying

33:48.461 --> 33:52.861
I could only
think about her

33:52.941 --> 33:54.461
I felt so guilty,

33:54.741 --> 33:57.661
like I was betraying
the memory of Theresa

33:57.741 --> 34:00.341
but I couldn t
take my eyes off her

You should see
what she does with my hose.

35:01.541 --> 35:03.301
I don't know what
would make me

35:03.301 --> 35:04.821
invite him over
for barbecue.

35:04.861 --> 35:06.901
You did say
you were going to.

35:07.021 --> 35:07.941
Hmm?

35:07.981 --> 35:08.901
Yeah, but --

35:08.901 --> 35:10.821
I say a lot of things.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.421
Why do you
think you did?

35:12.541 --> 35:14.061
I don't know.

35:14.101 --> 35:15.901
You tell me.

35:15.901 --> 35:17.141
The woman?

35:18.861 --> 35:21.101
Carl:
You know, he brings her

35:21.141 --> 35:24.101
and shes wearing
this nothing of a dress,

35:24.221 --> 35:26.981
its a slip!
I mean, you can see everything

35:27.101 --> 35:28.501
For a barbecue.

35:28.541 --> 35:30.781
No, no, wait a second,
what am I thinking? Hot pants.

35:30.861 --> 35:32.901
They re like
cupping everything,

35:33.061 --> 35:34.621
and-and this top--

35:34.701 --> 35:37.061
You could definitely
see her stomach

35:37.061 --> 35:39.101
Wait! No, no no --
sorry, it was a dress.

35:39.261 --> 35:41.101
It was a dress, like a,
like a summer kind of

35:41.101 --> 35:43.701
farmer girl dress, you know?

35:43.781 --> 35:45.421
With like, cherries and plums and --

35:45.541 --> 35:47.101
- Okay.
- little fruits.

35:47.101 --> 35:48.781
Shes walking
and shes bouncing

35:48.821 --> 35:50.541
and the grapes
and the melons,

35:50.621 --> 35:51.861
and they're Just
ba-boom, ba-boom --

35:51.901 --> 35:52.901
That's fine,
thank you.

35:52.981 --> 35:55.061
She's so sexy,
but pretty!

35:55.101 --> 35:56.541
- Okay, all right!
- No!

35:56.621 --> 35:58.341
All right!
That's enough!

35:59.581 --> 36:02.821
I get the picture!
Let's Just go on with the story.

36:02.821 --> 36:03.941
So then --

36:05.061 --> 36:06.581
In any case,

36:06.701 --> 36:08.581
the reason I called you was

36:08.581 --> 36:10.341
you're one guy I can trust

36:10.341 --> 36:12.341
in a situation like this.

36:12.341 --> 36:14.781
I got a guy with a hole
in the back of his head

36:14.861 --> 36:16.461
where the exit wound was...

36:19.101 --> 36:22.661
<i>♪ Oh were you Just
pleased to see me ♪</i>

36:24.661 --> 36:26.461
<i>♪ As you all know ♪</i>

36:26.541 --> 36:28.741

36:28.781 --> 36:30.341

36:30.461 --> 36:33.021

36:33.061 --> 36:35.261

36:37.501 --> 36:41.221

36:41.341 --> 36:43.941
Um, would anybody care
for another burger?

36:43.981 --> 36:45.861
I'll have a hot dog.

36:45.861 --> 36:47.341
If you have one.

36:50.101 --> 36:51.581
And then she grabs me
and she says,

36:51.741 --> 36:53.341
Lets get together sometime

36:55.621 --> 36:56.861
So she was
coming on to you?

36:56.901 --> 36:58.101
Yeah.

36:59.221 --> 37:01.101
It doesn't surprise me, really.

37:01.101 --> 37:02.301
It doesn't.

37:02.301 --> 37:03.661
No, 'cause --

37:03.741 --> 37:05.501
I mean, I don't mean
to sound full of myself, but...

37:05.581 --> 37:07.901
But what?

37:09.501 --> 37:10.621
You're irresistible?

37:10.701 --> 37:14.101
Women...
women find me attractive.

37:14.141 --> 37:17.541
Do you think
I'm attracted to you?

37:17.621 --> 37:19.101
Well, you're a doctor,

37:19.141 --> 37:21.341
so I think you have
that professional reserve.

37:21.381 --> 37:22.901
But even so,

37:22.981 --> 37:24.701
I think I felt something
when I walked in the office.

37:24.701 --> 37:25.821
It's okay, don't worry about it.

37:25.941 --> 37:27.421
You don't wanna
hear about all this.

37:27.541 --> 37:29.101
No, no, no --
go on, go on.

37:29.141 --> 37:30.101
You got the car,

37:30.141 --> 37:32.701
you're feelin' good
about yourself again,

37:32.701 --> 37:34.141
and boom!

37:34.181 --> 37:37.061
The sex picks up
again, right?

37:38.541 --> 37:40.701
Well, not exactly.

37:40.821 --> 37:43.901
I was watchin a lot of cable

37:43.901 --> 37:46.261
- Randy!

37:48.941 --> 37:50.341
Randy.

37:50.341 --> 37:52.221
Can we talk?

37:52.261 --> 37:53.501
Sure.

37:53.501 --> 37:55.901
What did you do all day?

37:55.901 --> 37:58.021
I'm watchin' this
Norwegian movie again,

37:58.061 --> 37:59.341
Maria Marushka

37:59.341 --> 38:01.341
It's really good.

38:01.421 --> 38:03.781
Randy.. I think
not having a Job

38:03.861 --> 38:05.741
is starting to get to you.

38:05.821 --> 38:08.701
No. It's not having any money
that's starting to get to me.

38:08.701 --> 38:10.781
Well, that is why
I think we need to talk.

38:10.861 --> 38:12.581
With what they pay me
at the store

38:12.701 --> 38:13.581
we can barely cover our bills,

38:13.701 --> 38:16.101
not to mention
the new dinette set I want,

38:16.221 --> 38:17.981
or the window treatments
I want in this room.

38:18.021 --> 38:19.901
Well, I'm sorry,
there's not much more I can do.

38:19.941 --> 38:22.341
I mean, nobody
seems to be hiring.

38:22.421 --> 38:24.461
That's why I went
to McCool's today

38:24.541 --> 38:26.461
and spoke to
your old boss, Joey.

38:26.501 --> 38:27.741
What!

38:27.781 --> 38:30.621
You didn't go down there
and-and beg him

38:30.701 --> 38:32.141
to give me my Job back!

38:32.301 --> 38:34.301
Of course I didn't!

38:34.301 --> 38:35.621
Good.

38:35.661 --> 38:37.461
But I am going to
The Moody Blues with him.

38:37.501 --> 38:38.781
- What?
- Tomorrow night.

38:38.861 --> 38:41.221
He seems to think
they're the Second Coming,

38:41.341 --> 38:43.061
but they're really
not my cup of tea.

38:43.061 --> 38:44.701
Wait a minute!
Why are you doing this?

38:44.861 --> 38:47.461
I'm doing this for us
as a couple, Randy.

38:47.501 --> 38:49.461
And more importantly,
I'm doing this for you

38:49.541 --> 38:50.821
and your sense
of self-worth.

38:50.901 --> 38:52.741
Huh?

38:52.821 --> 38:55.821
I think that you have
a lot of anger towards Joey,

38:55.901 --> 38:57.701
and that because of that,

38:57.821 --> 38:59.301
you feel less of a man

38:59.301 --> 39:01.461
because of his power
to take away your livelihood.

39:01.541 --> 39:02.981
You think i'm gonna
have less anger

39:03.021 --> 39:05.501
and feel like more of a man
if you start dating this guy?!

39:05.541 --> 39:06.901
No.

39:08.701 --> 39:10.861
I'm suggesting
that tomorrow night

39:10.901 --> 39:12.381
when you know
he's at the concert,

39:12.541 --> 39:13.621
you go to his house

39:13.701 --> 39:15.261
and you steal
everything of value

39:15.301 --> 39:17.341
you can fit into our car.

39:17.461 --> 39:18.461
You're Joking.

39:18.501 --> 39:19.621
No.

39:19.701 --> 39:23.501
I mean, come on,
the guy fired you.

39:23.581 --> 39:26.781
And he still owes you
six hours overtime, right?

39:26.861 --> 39:29.901
I Just don't think he knows
what he had with you.

39:29.941 --> 39:31.501
You're so wonderful,

39:31.541 --> 39:33.781
You're the best bartender
I've ever seen, by far.

39:33.861 --> 39:37.061
You know, the way
you worked those crowds,

39:37.141 --> 39:39.821
you really had 'em
in the palm of your hand.

39:39.901 --> 39:41.381
You know what
you reminded me of?

39:41.501 --> 39:42.301
What?

39:42.421 --> 39:45.621
A rock star.

39:45.701 --> 39:46.821
Really?

39:46.901 --> 39:48.541
Really.

39:50.341 --> 39:52.301
I don't know...

39:54.981 --> 39:56.821
I Just...

39:56.901 --> 39:58.861
I don't see myself
doing something like that.

39:58.981 --> 39:59.981
It's crazy.

40:00.101 --> 40:02.021
Once we fence
all his stuff,

40:02.021 --> 40:03.381
we'll make a pretty nice
chunk of change.

40:03.461 --> 40:05.301
Look, forget it!

40:05.381 --> 40:07.341
There's no way.

40:07.341 --> 40:09.301
Absolutely not.

40:09.421 --> 40:12.901
But you did it,
of course.

40:13.861 --> 40:15.301
Yeah, I did it.

40:22.501 --> 40:26.901
I knew Joey would have
A big CD collection

40:28.901 --> 40:31.341
And I was surprised at all
the other cool stuff he had

40:38.661 --> 40:40.581
You know,
Jewel must have taken

40:40.621 --> 40:42.981
a few more psychology courses
than me,

40:43.021 --> 40:45.501
because as crazy as I thought
the whole idea was,

40:45.581 --> 40:48.461
as reluctant as I was
to do it,

40:48.541 --> 40:50.901
by the end of the evening,
I felt great

40:54.701 --> 40:56.821
I still wonder how
she talked me into it.

40:56.861 --> 40:59.661
Here's a wild guess.

41:03.461 --> 41:04.501
Yeah.

41:04.541 --> 41:06.261
That probably had
somethin' to do with it.

41:16.501 --> 41:19.141
<i>♪ I got money in my pocket ♪</i>

41:19.261 --> 41:21.221

41:45.581 --> 41:47.501
Jewel?

41:48.701 --> 41:50.301
The Indian stays.

41:50.381 --> 41:52.661
I wasn't gonna
throw him away.

41:52.661 --> 41:53.701
Randy:
For a while there,

41:53.821 --> 41:55.701
we almost seemed
like a normal couple

41:55.821 --> 41:57.501
Burmeister:
You're slammin it night and day,

41:57.501 --> 42:00.581
poppin' your cork
like a bartender at a mob wedding,

42:00.701 --> 42:02.581
then one day, like it always happens,

42:02.621 --> 42:04.741
all that good nookie turns sour on ya.

42:04.781 --> 42:06.261
Yeah.

42:06.301 --> 42:07.861
What are you doing?

42:07.861 --> 42:09.221
Oh, nothing. Trash.

42:09.301 --> 42:10.501
Ah-ah-ah.

42:10.581 --> 42:11.581
Randy, come on,

42:11.621 --> 42:13.301
we have to throw
some things away.

42:13.301 --> 42:15.341
But not my
Sno-Globes, come on!

42:15.381 --> 42:17.821
Can't we Just compromise
and throw one Sno-Globe away?

42:17.861 --> 42:19.741
Jewel, these
came from my mom.

42:19.781 --> 42:21.701
See this one here?

42:21.741 --> 42:23.301
She brought it back
from Chicago.

42:23.421 --> 42:25.501
See, it's got
the Sears Tower here,

42:25.541 --> 42:28.741
and this one here
is very special.

42:28.821 --> 42:31.341
Ya see, my mom
used to say that

42:31.421 --> 42:33.021
this was our house,

42:33.141 --> 42:34.781
and as long as
I never broke it,

42:34.821 --> 42:37.341
we'd always have
a place to stay.

42:37.461 --> 42:40.821
I knew
s he was only Joking, but still...

42:44.061 --> 42:46.621
You're a sick puppy, man.

42:46.661 --> 42:49.981
So what kind of Job
do you have at this point?

42:50.061 --> 42:52.501
I hadn't got one yet.

42:52.541 --> 42:55.141
It was sort of
an ongoing problem between us.

42:55.261 --> 42:57.061
I-29, I-2-9.

42:57.101 --> 43:01.261
I was offered
the lunch shift at TGI-Friday's...

43:01.261 --> 43:03.141
You lucky stiff.

43:04.301 --> 43:06.861
I actually thought
it was kind of a step down

43:06.981 --> 43:08.501
from unemployment,
I mean...

43:08.541 --> 43:11.621
No, you got it,
you won -- I-29.

43:11.701 --> 43:12.981
Oh yeah.

43:14.101 --> 43:15.581
Um..

43:15.701 --> 43:17.621
Uh, bingo.

43:19.781 --> 43:21.701
We have a winner!

43:21.821 --> 43:24.501
I gotta be honest
with you, my young friend.

43:24.541 --> 43:26.621
I'm leaning towards
the girl on this one,

43:26.701 --> 43:28.621
I mean, she's made your dump
nice and livable,

43:28.741 --> 43:30.461
you're gettin'
good action on the mattress...

43:30.541 --> 43:32.541
Bingo person:
Hold onto it till you cash out.

43:32.661 --> 43:35.181
Least you could do
is make some money.

43:35.261 --> 43:37.061
Maybe you should be
playin' bingo.

43:37.141 --> 43:38.741
That's why...

43:38.821 --> 43:41.061
we decided
to do another...

43:41.101 --> 43:43.981
you know, break-in.

43:44.061 --> 43:45.501
What do you mean, "we"?

43:45.541 --> 43:46.981
Yeah, Jewel and me,

43:47.021 --> 43:48.701
I mean, I'm no criminal.

43:50.301 --> 43:51.501
I bet he's got a DVD.

43:51.541 --> 43:52.701
I'd love to
have one of those.

43:52.821 --> 43:53.701
Whoa.

43:53.741 --> 43:55.301
We're going to Montague's,

43:55.301 --> 43:56.661
so I borrowed something

43:56.741 --> 43:58.461
from the designer section
at the store.

43:58.501 --> 44:00.861
I Just think
you might have overshot,

44:00.861 --> 44:02.621
I mean,
even for Montague's.

44:02.661 --> 44:03.581
Really?

44:03.621 --> 44:04.301
Yeah.

44:04.461 --> 44:07.501
You know...

44:08.901 --> 44:11.301
...maybe we shouldn't
be doing this.

44:11.421 --> 44:12.661
The burglary?

44:12.781 --> 44:14.821
- Yeah.
- Oh, Randy!

44:14.901 --> 44:17.061
Joey's is one thing,
but this is something else.

44:17.061 --> 44:20.261
Would you be happier
if we weren't?

44:20.301 --> 44:22.501
Sure, wouldn't you?

44:22.541 --> 44:25.621
I'll show you
what makes me happy.

44:33.501 --> 44:36.061
These are all
pictures from magazines,

44:36.181 --> 44:37.301
things I've saved.

44:37.381 --> 44:40.661
Things that I want
in my house someday.

44:40.781 --> 44:42.301
I've been carrying this thing

44:42.421 --> 44:44.621
around with me for years.

44:44.661 --> 44:48.821
Whenever I feel lonely
or get depressed,

44:48.861 --> 44:51.301
I Just add in a new couch

44:51.301 --> 44:54.301
or a new set of drapes and...

44:54.381 --> 44:56.341
I don't know, Just dream.

44:58.061 --> 45:00.661
It makes me happy
to think that someday

45:00.661 --> 45:03.501
I might actually
live in the kind of house

45:03.581 --> 45:05.861
that looks like
it belongs in a magazine.

45:08.021 --> 45:10.941
You want me to be happy,
don't you, Randy?

45:10.981 --> 45:12.301
Of course I do.

45:17.781 --> 45:20.061
Burmeister:
So who was it this time?

45:20.181 --> 45:21.541
Randy:
Just some guy --

45:21.621 --> 45:23.341
God knows how they met

45:23.421 --> 45:25.981
They were going to some
fancy restaurant, Montagues

45:39.301 --> 45:42.261
Jewel was sure
she could keep him there

45:42.301 --> 45:44.061
for at least three hours

45:44.061 --> 45:45.301
It was a good thing, too,

45:45.421 --> 45:47.061
because it was gonna
take a little time

45:47.061 --> 45:50.301
to clean this guy out --
he had everything

46:01.901 --> 46:04.741
At first I couldn't find
his DVD player,

46:04.781 --> 46:08.501
and I really needed to,
since Jewel wanted one

46:13.261 --> 46:15.901
So I went upstairs,
and there it was

46:16.061 --> 46:17.541
DVD!

46:19.821 --> 46:21.101
Bingo!

46:23.821 --> 46:24.941
Him again?!

46:25.061 --> 46:29.101
You gotta be careful
when you say "bingo" in here.

46:29.221 --> 46:31.221
Bingo lady:
Not to worry, that was a false alarm.

46:31.301 --> 46:32.221
Sorry.

46:34.421 --> 46:36.061
It was like some game show

46:36.101 --> 46:39.141
where they send you
on a shopping spree

46:39.301 --> 46:41.941
I found a nice new Rolex --

46:42.061 --> 46:44.341
much nicer than
my old Swatch.

46:44.461 --> 46:48.061
Unfortunately,
this guy was I guess a midget

46:55.541 --> 46:58.301
And then things
started goin wrong

46:58.301 --> 46:59.861
What's this?

46:59.861 --> 47:01.781
This is the place
where it all happens, baby.

47:01.781 --> 47:02.861
Come on.

47:02.941 --> 47:03.861
Mi casa,
es su casa

47:03.981 --> 47:06.461
Greg! I thought we were
going out somewhere!

47:06.541 --> 47:07.501
Why go out, baby?

47:07.581 --> 47:08.981
We got it all right here!

47:09.061 --> 47:10.541
Best sound system
you ever heard,

47:10.581 --> 47:12.541
a little hot tub,
swimming pool...

47:15.221 --> 47:17.261
The Gregster might even
break out his secret stash

47:17.341 --> 47:18.861
of blow.

47:18.941 --> 47:20.061
Uh, Greg...

47:20.101 --> 47:23.541
Uh, I thought, uh...

47:23.541 --> 47:27.021
Why don't we
Just drive for a little longer,

47:27.141 --> 47:29.021
this car makes me so hot!

47:32.021 --> 47:35.301
I'll leave the front door open
if you wanna follow me, okay?

48:01.021 --> 48:02.301
Jewel:
Greg?

48:02.381 --> 48:03.421
Score!

48:05.781 --> 48:07.021
Oh, shit!

48:07.981 --> 48:09.061
Greg?

48:13.661 --> 48:14.861
Greg?

48:19.301 --> 48:20.581
Greg!

48:26.581 --> 48:27.701
Randy!

48:35.541 --> 48:37.701
I had a feeling
you'd find your way.

48:37.781 --> 48:39.621
This is a nice house.

48:39.701 --> 48:41.541
Too bad you're
such a shit.

48:41.621 --> 48:43.021
Heh!

48:43.141 --> 48:44.621
Greg:
A little dirty-talker.

48:44.701 --> 48:47.021
Okay, okay,
come on, let's talk.

48:47.181 --> 48:49.501
Why don't we go downstairs
and have a drink?

48:49.661 --> 48:52.021
I have a better idea, baby.
Let's talk after.

48:53.021 --> 48:54.021
Bitch!

48:54.101 --> 48:55.821
Come on, baby,
come on!

48:55.901 --> 48:57.061
Get off me!

49:03.541 --> 49:04.541
Ha ha!

49:04.581 --> 49:05.901
Bitch.

49:07.301 --> 49:08.741
You like it a little rough, huh?

49:08.781 --> 49:11.141
Oh, yeah, you wanna play?

49:13.541 --> 49:15.021
We'll play rough.

49:16.021 --> 49:18.181
We'll play very --

49:18.861 --> 49:19.581
Ungh!

49:36.821 --> 49:39.741
Oh, my God,
I don't believe this.

49:43.901 --> 49:45.901
What is it with you?

49:46.021 --> 49:47.661
Everywhere you go,
there's a dead guy.

49:47.781 --> 49:48.821
Take the DVD.

49:50.461 --> 49:51.861
Take the DVD!

49:53.821 --> 49:55.581
I'm not takin' the DVD.

49:55.621 --> 49:56.661
Why not?

49:56.781 --> 49:58.261
Well, I don't know,

49:58.341 --> 50:00.141
it Just does n't seem right.

50:00.181 --> 50:01.501
It was all right before?

50:01.581 --> 50:05.261
Before there wasn't
a dead guy lyin' on the floor.

50:05.381 --> 50:07.541
Y'know, I never
saw a dead person till i met you.

50:07.661 --> 50:09.021
The guy was
trying to rape me,

50:09.141 --> 50:10.341
does that mean
anything to you?

50:10.461 --> 50:11.341
Now take the DVD!

50:11.461 --> 50:13.301
I'm not takin' the DVD!

50:13.301 --> 50:15.821
Don't you want to live
in the type of house

50:15.941 --> 50:18.221
that has a first-rate
home entertainment center,

50:18.301 --> 50:19.661
including a DVD?

50:19.701 --> 50:21.261
I already got
his big-screen.

50:21.341 --> 50:23.581
I don't see the difference
between taking his big-screen

50:23.661 --> 50:26.101
or taking his DVD --
I want that DVD.

50:26.221 --> 50:29.221
'Cause the big-screen
is already down in the car.

50:32.381 --> 50:34.661
Jewel:
I get all dressed up,

50:34.741 --> 50:36.221
I get a friggin' shiner,

50:36.261 --> 50:37.781
I don't get dinner,

50:37.821 --> 50:39.181
and I don't get the DVD --

50:40.781 --> 50:43.701
Randy:
I didn't care about the TV,

50:43.741 --> 50:45.581
I was Just doin this
to make Jewel happy

50:45.661 --> 50:48.021
But you didn't
take the DVD.

50:48.021 --> 50:50.981
TV: A local attorney
was found slain this morning...

50:51.021 --> 50:53.341
Jewel:
I do not believe we were in that
gazillion-dollar house

50:53.381 --> 50:55.021
and we didn't end up
with a thing.

50:55.061 --> 50:57.661
Did you forget
about the dead guy on the floor?

50:57.781 --> 51:00.021
No, I did not forget about
the dead guy on the floor,

51:00.021 --> 51:02.021
but we're not
talking about him right now,

51:02.101 --> 51:04.621
we're talking about the dead guy
on the floor's stuff,

51:04.741 --> 51:07.021
and he had a lot of stuff,
stuff we could have taken

51:07.021 --> 51:09.021
if you weren't such a chickens hit.

51:09.021 --> 51:10.021
What's that?

51:10.061 --> 51:12.661
So now
I'm a chicken shit, is that it?

51:12.701 --> 51:16.021
Yes, I believe that's
the technical term for what you are.

51:16.021 --> 51:19.461
Yeah, well,
I'd rather be a chicken shit

51:19.501 --> 51:21.461
than whatever
the hell is it that you are.

51:21.501 --> 51:23.101
I'm the woman
living with the chicken shit.

51:23.221 --> 51:24.581
Not for long.

51:24.661 --> 51:27.021
Yeah, not for long,
that's right,

51:27.021 --> 51:29.141
because I need a real man,
someone I can count on,

51:29.221 --> 51:31.341
not a chicken shit like you.

51:33.141 --> 51:34.461
Ah, good, company.

51:36.381 --> 51:38.701
TV:
Thus far, police have no leads...

51:41.821 --> 51:43.981
It's that cop!

51:44.981 --> 51:46.781
Aren't you glad we don't have

51:46.821 --> 51:48.981
a lot of stolen stuff
lyin' around now?

51:54.501 --> 51:55.861
You're a genius.

51:55.901 --> 51:58.021
- Hi.
- Morning.

51:58.141 --> 51:59.381
Thought you'd wanna know

51:59.421 --> 52:01.261
we closed the investigation
on the shooting at McCool's,

52:01.341 --> 52:02.701
no charges will be filed.

52:02.781 --> 52:04.501
We're gonna let you slide
on the unregistered gun

52:04.621 --> 52:06.421
'cause it was self-defense.

52:06.541 --> 52:07.461
Thanks.

52:07.541 --> 52:09.261
Everything okay, ma'am?

52:09.261 --> 52:11.301
Yeah. Sure.

52:11.381 --> 52:13.781
Those are some
pretty nasty bruises.

52:13.781 --> 52:15.181
Huh?

52:16.421 --> 52:18.581
Oh yeah, she --
had an accident.

52:18.661 --> 52:19.941
Accident?

52:19.941 --> 52:22.181
Would you mind if I
talk to her for a minute?

52:22.261 --> 52:23.541
Sure.

52:24.621 --> 52:26.021
Alone?

52:26.061 --> 52:27.621
Okay.

52:30.821 --> 52:34.821
At the time, I was glad
Jewel was gonna talk to him

52:34.941 --> 52:36.821
She knew how to
handle the cops,

52:36.861 --> 52:38.421
what to say
to get rid of em

52:38.501 --> 52:40.941
She was good that way

52:47.021 --> 52:48.741
Whatever happened in there,

52:48.741 --> 52:50.781
she doesn't want
to talk about it.

52:50.781 --> 52:52.701
That's 'cause
nothing happened.

52:52.741 --> 52:54.541
What we do in these
domestic violence situations

52:54.621 --> 52:56.261
is ask you to
vacate the premises.

52:56.261 --> 52:57.821
What domestic violence?!

52:57.901 --> 52:59.741
I will go to a Judge who will
issue a restraining order

52:59.821 --> 53:01.461
which means you are not
allowed on this property --

53:01.581 --> 53:02.741
This is my house!

53:02.821 --> 53:04.741
Or within 100 yards of your wife
until this matter is settled.

53:04.741 --> 53:06.461
She's not my wife!

53:06.581 --> 53:09.061
That's too bad --
you'd have more rights if she were.

53:09.181 --> 53:10.821
You expect me to
Just walk away?

53:10.941 --> 53:12.501
If you don't, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to arrest you.

53:12.581 --> 53:14.701
You can't be serious!

53:14.701 --> 53:17.461
This-- this--
can't I Just talk to her?

53:17.581 --> 53:19.021
I don't think that would
be wise at this time, sir.

53:19.141 --> 53:22.181
Whatever she told you,
she's-- she--

53:22.221 --> 53:23.701
It's not true,

53:23.781 --> 53:25.261
y'know, okay?

53:27.661 --> 53:30.421
Hey, Jewel, honey,
could you come out here, please?

53:30.501 --> 53:32.781
I could still book you
on the unregistered gun.

53:32.941 --> 53:34.461
Hun!

53:34.501 --> 53:36.261
Jewel!

53:36.301 --> 53:38.341
Would you be kind enough
to tell the police officer

53:38.421 --> 53:40.261
that I didn't hit you!

53:40.261 --> 53:42.421
Would you please
tell the officer

53:42.501 --> 53:43.781
that I didn't
do anything to you?

53:43.861 --> 53:45.501
Don't make me
use force, sir.

53:48.741 --> 53:50.341
Jewel!

53:51.381 --> 53:52.981
Jewel!

54:03.821 --> 54:06.221
Randy:
I couldn't believe it

54:09.421 --> 54:13.421
I was so pissed at her
I thought I was gonna explode

54:14.821 --> 54:16.901
Well, I gotta admit,
she's not perfect.

54:17.021 --> 54:18.141
Not perfect?!

54:20.981 --> 54:22.781
Charlie:
She's like this pure, delicate flower,

54:22.821 --> 54:24.621
I Just wanted
to protect her.

54:24.621 --> 54:28.181
- But, uh, she was
living with another man.

54:28.261 --> 54:31.501
- That piece of slime?
he didn't deserve her.

54:31.541 --> 54:33.461
And you did?

54:34.381 --> 54:35.861
I don't know.

54:37.181 --> 54:38.581
Oh, Charlie.

54:38.701 --> 54:41.301
I was totally
consumed by her.

54:41.421 --> 54:43.621
My every thought
was of her.

54:43.661 --> 54:46.741
I was walkin' around in a haze.

54:46.821 --> 54:47.941
People talked to me,

54:47.981 --> 54:49.501
but I didn't hear
what they were saying

54:49.621 --> 54:51.021
Cop:
Gregory Potter Spradling.

54:51.141 --> 54:55.021
A lawyer at
Ragsdale, Hersch & Klein.

54:55.021 --> 54:56.501
- What did he do?

54:56.621 --> 54:58.221
"Do"?

54:58.381 --> 55:00.261
For a living.

55:00.381 --> 55:03.221
Lawyer. Ragsdale,
Hersch & Klein.

55:03.381 --> 55:04.621
- It doesn't
make sense.

55:04.741 --> 55:06.741
Why would you go
to all the trouble

55:06.821 --> 55:09.861
of stealing a big-screen TV
and leave a DVD behind?

55:09.901 --> 55:11.141
Poor guy

55:11.261 --> 55:13.261
The only thing
goin through my head

55:13.301 --> 55:14.421
was her

55:14.501 --> 55:16.581
Everything okay, ma'am?

55:16.621 --> 55:18.621
Yeah. Sure.

55:19.621 --> 55:22.261
Those are some
pretty nasty bruises.

55:22.381 --> 55:25.061
Would you mind if I
spoke to her for a minute?

55:25.181 --> 55:26.781
Knock yourself out.

55:28.981 --> 55:30.541
Charlie, what is it?

55:30.621 --> 55:32.221
Why would God fill me
with this desire

55:32.301 --> 55:34.021
If I wasn't
meant to be with her?

55:37.181 --> 55:40.261
Sometimes some time apart
is the best thing.

55:42.221 --> 55:44.981
I could arrange that.

55:45.141 --> 55:47.461
Would I get to
stay in the house?

55:47.621 --> 55:49.141
A temporary
restraining order

55:49.261 --> 55:52.301
would keep him way
for... 90 days.

55:52.341 --> 55:54.741
But permanently?

55:54.821 --> 55:56.741
You'd have to get a lawyer.

55:56.821 --> 55:59.101
Do you know one?

55:59.221 --> 56:03.221
Yeah. I know one.

56:03.221 --> 56:04.101
She called you?

56:04.221 --> 56:05.821
Yes-- I didn't call her.

56:05.861 --> 56:07.941
She tells me things
are going badly with Randy,

56:07.981 --> 56:10.581
so I thought
maybe I could help her out

56:10.661 --> 56:12.621
and introduce her to
one of the guys in my office.

56:12.661 --> 56:14.981
In fact, I did, I once introduced her
to this other attorney,

56:15.101 --> 56:18.221
Greg, who's this...

56:18.221 --> 56:19.901
...guy who was murdered.

56:21.821 --> 56:25.221
Anyway, she Just knew
that Karen and I were having problems.

56:25.341 --> 56:26.341
Were you?

56:26.421 --> 56:28.141
Yes, you could say that.

56:28.261 --> 56:29.741
Sexual problems?

56:29.781 --> 56:31.581
Hey, you know...

56:31.661 --> 56:33.701
Okay, if you want
to label it, yeah.

56:33.741 --> 56:36.101
But I'm not saying
it's Karen's fault.

56:36.221 --> 56:38.261
Was it your fault?

56:38.301 --> 56:41.221
Maybe it was
Karen's fault.

56:41.301 --> 56:44.381
Was there sex between
you and this woman?

56:46.421 --> 56:47.661
Yes.

56:48.861 --> 56:51.621
You want it now,
lawyer boy?

56:51.661 --> 56:53.581
- Yes! Yes, please!

56:53.581 --> 56:54.501
Oh, my God!

56:54.581 --> 56:56.061
Oh, my God!

56:56.181 --> 56:57.181
Oh, my God!

56:58.421 --> 56:59.741
What happened there?

56:59.821 --> 57:01.101
Wh-why'd we stop?

57:02.181 --> 57:03.421
What?

57:03.461 --> 57:05.741
I need to ask you
for a favor.

57:05.821 --> 57:07.221
Anything at all --
anything!

57:07.341 --> 57:09.421
Um-hmm, um-hmm.

57:09.421 --> 57:10.981
I'm gonna need
some legal advice soon.

57:11.061 --> 57:12.221
You got it!

57:12.381 --> 57:13.661
You got it.

57:13.781 --> 57:15.821
You aren't Just saying that?
- You got it.

57:15.981 --> 57:17.621
You want this?
You like it?

57:17.741 --> 57:18.981
Can you help me?

57:18.981 --> 57:20.981
Anything!
- Say it!

57:20.981 --> 57:22.421
I will give you
legal advice.

57:22.501 --> 57:24.981
Say it!
- I will give you legal advice!

57:25.101 --> 57:26.581
- Say... it!

57:26.661 --> 57:28.741
I'm saying, I will give you
legal advice.

57:28.781 --> 57:31.221
Yeah?
- Whooah!

57:31.341 --> 57:33.101
- She whipped you?
- Yes.

57:33.261 --> 57:35.301
With a whip?
- Yes.

57:35.421 --> 57:36.661
And you en Joyed it?

57:38.501 --> 57:39.661
Yes.

57:42.901 --> 57:44.861
Charlie
I spent so much time

57:44.941 --> 57:46.181
going by her house,

57:46.301 --> 57:48.621
if you didn't know
my intentions were pure

57:48.741 --> 57:50.981
you d think I was stalking her

57:50.981 --> 57:52.421
Hello.

57:54.661 --> 57:56.101
Hi.

57:56.181 --> 57:58.941
I looked for any excuse
to go see her

57:59.101 --> 58:00.741
I spoke to
a friend of mine

58:00.781 --> 58:02.741
about helping you
with keeping the house.

58:02.781 --> 58:04.101
Oh, good. Thanks.

58:04.141 --> 58:05.621
I, uh, I Just

58:05.661 --> 58:07.781
wish I had known
a bit sooner.

58:07.901 --> 58:10.981
See, I already sort of contacted
this other lawyer.

58:11.061 --> 58:13.221
Well, if you'd
rather use him --

58:13.341 --> 58:15.981
It's Just that I'm not sure if I can
get my retainer back.

58:17.181 --> 58:18.461
Well, lawyers--

58:18.541 --> 58:20.941
They'll always try to
find a way to screw you.

58:21.101 --> 58:22.661
Yeah.

58:23.741 --> 58:25.581
Well, I-I better --

58:25.581 --> 58:26.981
I, uh --
- Yeah?

58:27.061 --> 58:29.541
I was making
some supper...

58:29.581 --> 58:31.661
If you'd like to...

58:31.701 --> 58:33.621
It's nothing special.

58:36.781 --> 58:38.541
Surely this was
the hand of God.

58:38.621 --> 58:41.221
How do you mean, Charlie?

58:41.341 --> 58:44.181
In an instant I was transformed
from a broken man, made whole.

58:44.181 --> 58:46.981
It was like Theresa
had been brought back to me

58:47.021 --> 58:48.981
She even looked like Theresa --

58:49.101 --> 58:51.701
The way she moved,

58:51.781 --> 58:53.381
The way she smiled

58:55.221 --> 58:59.861
<i>♪ Her skin is like velvet ♪</i>

59:02.221 --> 59:06.781
<i>♪ Her face cut from stone ♪</i>

59:08.821 --> 59:12.541
<i>♪ Her eyes when
she's smiling... ♪</i>

59:12.581 --> 59:14.461
Can I help you with that?
- No thanks.

59:14.501 --> 59:16.661
I'll be right back.

59:16.741 --> 59:19.501
She even made linguini
with tomatoes and onions

59:19.581 --> 59:21.101
like Theresa used to

59:21.181 --> 59:22.981
Linguini with
tomatoes and onions.

59:23.101 --> 59:24.021
Jeez.

59:26.221 --> 59:27.781
What's that?

59:27.861 --> 59:29.141
Oh -- Nothing.

59:29.221 --> 59:32.341
Probably Just a cat
got into the garbage.

59:32.421 --> 59:34.421
Bread?
- Thanks.

59:34.461 --> 59:36.221
How come you never
wear a uniform?

59:36.341 --> 59:37.861
I'm a detective.

59:37.981 --> 59:39.781
Sometimes I do,
it depends.

59:39.861 --> 59:42.741
I bet you look
real good in it.

59:42.781 --> 59:46.661
I couldn't wipe
the goofy smile off my face

59:46.701 --> 59:49.741
I was so happy

59:49.981 --> 59:51.381
Because of her
I lost my Job,

59:51.461 --> 59:52.941
I lost my house,

59:53.061 --> 59:56.381
I'm an accessory
in not only one, but two murders.

59:56.461 --> 59:57.581
- Shh!

59:57.661 --> 01:00:00.901
Randy:
I couldn't stop thinking about her

01:00:01.021 --> 01:00:03.141
Okay, maybe I wasn t
allowed on the property,

01:00:03.221 --> 01:00:05.741
but that didn't mean I couldn t
keep an eye on her

01:00:12.821 --> 01:00:15.221
And then

01:00:15.341 --> 01:00:18.261
she did something
that sent me over the edge

01:00:20.381 --> 01:00:23.901
I knew I had to
do something

01:00:23.941 --> 01:00:25.821
something drastic
to salvage

01:00:25.981 --> 01:00:28.221
what little I had left

01:00:33.781 --> 01:00:35.381
I got the ten thousand.

01:00:35.461 --> 01:00:37.221
Bingo parlor, right?

01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:38.581
Burmeister:
Yeah.

01:00:38.701 --> 01:00:39.581
The code is,

01:00:39.701 --> 01:00:42.861
I say, "It looks like we might
get some rain"...

01:00:42.981 --> 01:00:44.581
We came up with a code.

01:00:44.661 --> 01:00:47.181
I said, "Looks like
we might get some rain"--

01:00:47.261 --> 01:00:49.101
Yeah, yeah,
I know this part.

01:00:49.141 --> 01:00:51.061
Yeah, right.

01:00:51.141 --> 01:00:52.581
You slept with
Randy's girlfriend?!

01:00:52.621 --> 01:00:55.461
I mean, it's not like
I never did anything for him.

01:00:55.581 --> 01:00:57.621
He called and he
needed ten grand,

01:00:57.701 --> 01:00:59.181
so I advised him for free,

01:00:59.221 --> 01:01:00.461
I advised him
how he could borrow

01:01:00.581 --> 01:01:02.141
against that old crappy house
his mom left him.

01:01:02.141 --> 01:01:03.581
You're missing the point.

01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:06.581
How did you feel after you slept
with your cousin's girlfriend?

01:01:06.661 --> 01:01:08.461
He's not even a cousin, really,

01:01:08.501 --> 01:01:10.701
He's my uncle's wife's brother's kid.

01:01:10.781 --> 01:01:13.701
So he's not a blood relative
or anything.

01:01:13.741 --> 01:01:15.461
Did she ever call
and ask for legal advice?

01:01:15.541 --> 01:01:17.581
No. No. I keep waiting.

01:01:17.661 --> 01:01:19.701
It's like she's teasing me.

01:01:19.741 --> 01:01:21.541
I'm dying to give her legal advice.

01:01:21.581 --> 01:01:24.821
I Just seem to be thinking
about her more and more

01:01:24.941 --> 01:01:26.421
Woman:
Excuse me.

01:01:26.461 --> 01:01:28.581
There's a police detective
here to see you about Greg.

01:01:28.701 --> 01:01:30.381
Sure.

01:01:30.461 --> 01:01:31.981
Thanks.

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.581
- Sorry about the mess,

01:01:33.701 --> 01:01:35.141
I'm in the middle
of changing offices.

01:01:35.141 --> 01:01:37.781
How well did you know
Greg Spradling?

01:01:37.901 --> 01:01:39.781
Uh, not that well,

01:01:39.901 --> 01:01:42.421
we worked here for
the last four or five years.

01:01:42.461 --> 01:01:44.701
You were both up for the same promotion,
weren't you?

01:01:44.781 --> 01:01:46.381
No, not --

01:01:46.381 --> 01:01:48.421
Not really.

01:01:48.461 --> 01:01:49.701
Greg was a good guy --

01:01:49.781 --> 01:01:52.141
No disrespect for the dead --

01:01:52.141 --> 01:01:53.981
Not really partner material.

01:01:54.021 --> 01:01:56.261
So no matter who
I'm talking to,

01:01:56.381 --> 01:01:58.061
she's Just --
she's on my mind.

01:01:58.221 --> 01:02:00.381
Can you think of anything
that might be useful to us

01:02:00.461 --> 01:02:01.581
in our investigation?

01:02:01.621 --> 01:02:05.781
Sounds to me like he
picked up some rough trade.

01:02:05.901 --> 01:02:08.741
Who knows what happened?

01:02:08.861 --> 01:02:12.181
There could have been...

01:02:12.181 --> 01:02:13.941
...leather.

01:02:14.061 --> 01:02:17.821
There could have been
some bondage...

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:21.901
Maybe those spiky things...

01:02:21.901 --> 01:02:24.821
Maybe some whipping.

01:02:28.941 --> 01:02:30.981
Could have been pretty kinky.

01:02:32.821 --> 01:02:35.741
But we all know
what that's like, right?

01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:38.101
No sir, I don't.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:40.741
That's how much
she messed me up.

01:02:40.821 --> 01:02:43.381
I mean, I'm being
investigated for a murder,

01:02:43.461 --> 01:02:45.181
and all I can
think about is her.

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:47.221
And the whip?
- Yes.

01:02:47.341 --> 01:02:49.781
There was another reason
I went to see her that day.

01:02:58.421 --> 01:03:00.941
Something had come up
at work

01:03:01.061 --> 01:03:03.981
The shoe prints we found
on Winfield road

01:03:04.021 --> 01:03:06.181
turned out to be
Converse All-Stars,

01:03:06.301 --> 01:03:08.981
the same brand
the boyfriend wore

01:03:09.101 --> 01:03:11.181
And if he was there,

01:03:11.341 --> 01:03:14.661
there was a chance
she might have been

01:03:16.501 --> 01:03:19.301
I had the same sick feeling
in my stomach

01:03:19.381 --> 01:03:21.341
that I had when I was
waiting for The results

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:24.061
to come back from the lab
at the hospital

01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:28.301
Unfortunately, her print did
match one at the murder site

01:03:28.381 --> 01:03:33.021
That scum,
that boyfriend of hers

01:03:33.141 --> 01:03:35.261
There's no telling
what he forced her to do

01:03:35.381 --> 01:03:37.781
before I came along --
I wasn't going to let her

01:03:37.901 --> 01:03:40.381
get dragged into
a murder investigation

01:03:40.421 --> 01:03:43.261
I knew she had
nothing to do with it

01:03:43.341 --> 01:03:45.941
There's something
I have to ask you.

01:03:46.061 --> 01:03:48.941
Is it an inside question
or an outside question?

01:03:49.061 --> 01:03:51.981
There was a burglary last week
on Winfield Road.

01:03:52.141 --> 01:03:53.941
A man was killed.

01:03:54.061 --> 01:03:55.301
- Was she able
to convince you

01:03:55.381 --> 01:03:57.901
that she didn't have anything
to do with it?

01:04:00.741 --> 01:04:06.301
She was very convincing

01:04:06.381 --> 01:04:08.101
It was a miracle!

01:04:26.701 --> 01:04:28.141
There was sex?

01:04:28.181 --> 01:04:31.741
God help me,
It was wonderful.

01:04:31.821 --> 01:04:34.421
No, for me to help you,

01:04:34.501 --> 01:04:36.821
I-I need to
hear everything.

01:04:36.941 --> 01:04:39.181
See, you have to
tell me all about

01:04:39.261 --> 01:04:42.461
the-the-various acts
of physical congress between --

01:04:42.501 --> 01:04:44.301
- I already told you that.

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:46.181
Okay, no, that's fine,

01:04:46.301 --> 01:04:48.501
I'm not-- it doesn't--

01:04:48.581 --> 01:04:50.621
I shouldn't
have done that.

01:04:50.661 --> 01:04:52.701
It's okay,
I wanted to.

01:04:54.821 --> 01:04:57.701
Are you going to
arrest Randy?

01:04:57.781 --> 01:05:00.381
I've got a warrant
out for him now.

01:05:00.421 --> 01:05:02.781
That car he's driving
is stolen.

01:05:02.821 --> 01:05:04.941
Add a murder charge to that

01:05:04.941 --> 01:05:08.221
and you won't see him for a long time.

01:05:08.221 --> 01:05:12.181
So I'll get to keep the house.

01:05:14.581 --> 01:05:16.421
This...

01:05:17.741 --> 01:05:19.821
This is all I have left.

01:05:26.181 --> 01:05:28.541
How not perfect
can one woman be?

01:05:28.621 --> 01:05:31.381
Aces in the boink department.

01:05:31.381 --> 01:05:33.501
Got yourself
a snazzy new watch.

01:05:33.621 --> 01:05:35.701
Like this is supposed
to make everything better?

01:05:35.781 --> 01:05:37.301
But you gotta admit,
that's a beaut.

01:05:37.381 --> 01:05:39.341
Here's the money,
Just take it.

01:05:39.421 --> 01:05:41.701
Take it. Take it!
- Shh!

01:05:41.741 --> 01:05:43.861
Kid -- easy, easy.

01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:45.901

01:05:49.301 --> 01:05:50.741
to the front desk.

01:05:50.861 --> 01:05:52.821
Is that my car?

01:05:52.941 --> 01:05:55.301
You got any idea
what they want?

01:05:55.381 --> 01:05:56.741
No.

01:05:56.781 --> 01:05:59.181
Is there any possibility
that she might have --

01:05:59.181 --> 01:06:01.221
Stolen?
- Yeah.

01:06:01.341 --> 01:06:03.461
Bingo lady:
I want to remind everyone

01:06:03.581 --> 01:06:04.981
that Saturday is "Hawaiian night."

01:06:05.101 --> 01:06:07.181
She gave me a stolen car.

01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:10.381
Women are much more complicated
than we think they are.

01:06:10.501 --> 01:06:12.421
C'mon, let's
get out of here.

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:27.101
You know,
to tell you the truth,

01:06:27.221 --> 01:06:29.341
she doesn't sound worse
than most of 'em.

01:06:29.341 --> 01:06:31.141
- But you'll
do it, right?

01:06:31.141 --> 01:06:33.101
Business is business.

01:06:54.901 --> 01:06:58.421

for a murder investigation

01:06:59.421 --> 01:07:01.581

01:07:01.661 --> 01:07:05.101

...a good woman can bring a man.

01:07:10.181 --> 01:07:11.381
Oh...

01:07:11.421 --> 01:07:13.261
Yes, I have this great Job

01:07:13.341 --> 01:07:14.581
and this great office
and this great family

01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:15.861
and this great house --

01:07:15.941 --> 01:07:17.181
How does this
make you feel?

01:07:17.301 --> 01:07:18.741
Empty.

01:07:18.821 --> 01:07:20.101
I feel nothing.

01:07:20.261 --> 01:07:22.341
And who knows,
it happened so fast.

01:07:22.421 --> 01:07:23.701
I mean, here's this guy
in my office --

01:07:23.701 --> 01:07:25.181
-- what is he,
thirty-five years old --

01:07:25.181 --> 01:07:26.901
and he goes like that.

01:07:26.901 --> 01:07:28.661
I could walk out
of your office

01:07:28.701 --> 01:07:30.141
and get hit by a truck.

01:07:30.181 --> 01:07:32.181
I don't want to live like that anymore.

01:07:32.221 --> 01:07:33.981
Let me Just feel something, anything,

01:07:34.101 --> 01:07:36.821
and then I will look up
and I will say,

01:07:36.941 --> 01:07:40.741
"Thank you, God.
Thank you for that gift."

01:07:40.821 --> 01:07:45.141
And... then if the truck
wants to get me, then okay.

01:07:45.221 --> 01:07:47.301
And then I meet this woman.

01:07:47.381 --> 01:07:51.021
She makes me feel...

01:07:59.181 --> 01:08:00.781
Thank you.

01:08:02.061 --> 01:08:03.381

01:08:03.501 --> 01:08:04.741
I'm sorry.

01:08:04.861 --> 01:08:07.581
- Have you acted on your desire
to see this woman again?

01:08:07.701 --> 01:08:10.501
Do you think I should?

01:08:12.421 --> 01:08:14.141
Time's up.

01:08:14.141 --> 01:08:15.301
What?

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:16.661
Sorry, time's up.

01:08:16.741 --> 01:08:18.421
What, are you kidding me?

01:08:18.541 --> 01:08:20.661
Are you Joking?
- Your time's up.

01:08:20.741 --> 01:08:22.981

No. But I do kill people.

to try our new fragrance?

01:09:34.501 --> 01:09:35.741

01:10:14.901 --> 01:10:15.981

Hey buddy, It's me, Randy.

01:10:17.941 --> 01:10:19.981
- Hey, I was Just talkin'
to somebody about you.

01:10:20.101 --> 01:10:21.901
What, uh, what's up?

01:10:21.901 --> 01:10:23.541
- Not a whole hell of a lot.

01:10:23.661 --> 01:10:25.101
I'm Just here in Collinsville.

01:10:25.141 --> 01:10:27.501
Jewel and I needed a little time
away from each other.

01:10:27.661 --> 01:10:29.181
Oh...

01:10:29.301 --> 01:10:31.341
So, uh, so she didn't go with you?

01:10:31.421 --> 01:10:32.941
- No, man.

01:10:33.021 --> 01:10:35.781
So she's-- She's home,

01:10:35.901 --> 01:10:38.581
she's all by herself now?

01:10:38.621 --> 01:10:42.141
Jewel and I had a little bit of a tiff.

01:10:42.261 --> 01:10:45.341
Good. Spend a coupla days away
and let things cool off.

01:10:45.421 --> 01:10:47.901
And you know what?
Thing's will work out fine.

01:10:48.021 --> 01:10:49.581
Do you really think so?
- Absolutely!

01:10:49.621 --> 01:10:51.461
Okay.

01:10:51.541 --> 01:10:53.101

01:11:25.901 --> 01:11:29.181

Man:

01:12:24.381 --> 01:12:25.701
Garbage man:

01:12:51.461 --> 01:12:55.421

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:20.341
No, I don't want
to talk to the kids.

01:13:20.381 --> 01:13:21.501
Can you Just tell them?

01:13:21.621 --> 01:13:22.781
Don't-don't put them on.

01:13:22.901 --> 01:13:25.701
You don't have to --
Hi, Sweetie!

01:13:25.741 --> 01:13:29.141
Um, ah, no.
Daddy's not gonna be home.

01:13:30.461 --> 01:13:31.861
What do you mean?

01:13:31.861 --> 01:13:33.901
Well, how did the dog get out?

01:13:33.901 --> 01:13:35.381
Well, where's his leash?

01:13:50.701 --> 01:13:52.621
Okay, Daddy's gotta --

01:13:53.381 --> 01:13:54.501
Daddy's gotta go.

01:13:54.661 --> 01:13:55.781
- Dad, don't --
Okay, Sweetheart.

01:14:47.381 --> 01:14:48.501
Cosmetic department, please.

01:14:48.541 --> 01:14:50.581
Cosmetic department!

01:14:50.621 --> 01:14:52.501
Bye.

01:16:03.701 --> 01:16:05.861
you can't Just
barge into somebody's house!

01:16:05.901 --> 01:16:07.781
Keep your hands up, Scummo.

01:16:07.821 --> 01:16:09.461
You are in big trouble.

01:16:09.501 --> 01:16:10.461
You need a search warrant.

01:16:10.541 --> 01:16:11.661
I happen to be an attorney.

01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:12.661
I Just made partner

01:16:12.701 --> 01:16:14.861
at the second-largest
law firm in the state.

01:16:14.861 --> 01:16:16.341
That's where
I've seen you before.

01:16:16.381 --> 01:16:17.621
You need
a search warrant.

01:16:17.701 --> 01:16:19.541
This is my
girlfriend's house!

01:16:19.621 --> 01:16:22.501
Bullshit! This is
Randy Weltzer's house.

01:16:22.581 --> 01:16:23.981
He happens to be
my cousin.

01:16:24.141 --> 01:16:25.541
He's your cousin?
- Yes.

01:16:25.621 --> 01:16:27.501
And as his attorney,
I can assure you

01:16:27.621 --> 01:16:30.861
that he will be
filing a suit against you

01:16:30.861 --> 01:16:32.901
and the entire
St. Louis Police Department.

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:34.821
Well, I guess it'll be
right after he stands trial

01:16:34.861 --> 01:16:36.661
for the murder of your former associate
Gregory Spradling.

01:16:36.781 --> 01:16:38.621
Wh-what?!

01:16:38.701 --> 01:16:40.621
Are you crazy?

01:16:40.661 --> 01:16:43.381
Mister, you better take a good long
look in the mirror

01:16:43.501 --> 01:16:45.381
before you call
somebody else crazy.

01:16:45.501 --> 01:16:47.301
Get your clothes on.
I'm takin' you in.

01:16:47.341 --> 01:16:48.901
Okay, um, for what?

01:16:48.901 --> 01:16:50.181
For murder.

01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:52.541
You and Spradling were in competition
for the same position.

01:16:52.621 --> 01:16:55.141
So you and your...

01:16:55.141 --> 01:16:57.981
...gay incestuous lover
killed him.

01:16:58.101 --> 01:16:59.381
What?! No--

01:16:59.501 --> 01:17:01.061
First of all, I am not gay.

01:17:01.141 --> 01:17:03.101
Interesting choice of wardrobe, then.

01:17:03.181 --> 01:17:04.981
I'm married, with two kids.

01:17:05.101 --> 01:17:06.341
Ha ha!

01:17:06.381 --> 01:17:07.501
I'm so not gay,

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:09.581
I'm here to fuck
my cousin's girlfriend.

01:17:09.621 --> 01:17:10.981
I oughta shoot you
right now.

01:17:11.021 --> 01:17:12.221
He's not really my cousin,

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:13.941
he's my uncle's wife's
brother's kid.

01:17:14.061 --> 01:17:14.661
That's enough!

01:17:14.741 --> 01:17:16.381
- Come on, hey!

01:17:16.461 --> 01:17:17.981
Freeze!
Freeze!

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:21.621
You're making
a very big mistake.

01:17:21.701 --> 01:17:24.781
You better watch it, buddy,
I am an attorney!

01:17:27.181 --> 01:17:28.701
Get down!

01:17:28.821 --> 01:17:31.181
You're making
a very serious mistake!

01:17:31.301 --> 01:17:33.381
Shut up!
- Ungh!

01:17:34.981 --> 01:17:37.701
Un! You're
in big trouble!

01:17:37.821 --> 01:17:39.421
Carl:
Okay, here she is.

01:17:39.501 --> 01:17:41.101
She'll clear up
this whole thing.

01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:44.301
What are you
doing here?!

01:17:44.381 --> 01:17:45.941
Uh, Carl...

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:47.461
What's goin' on?

01:17:49.141 --> 01:17:50.981
It's not what
it looks like.

01:17:51.101 --> 01:17:53.621
Why are you
wearing that?

01:17:53.701 --> 01:17:55.301
Like you don't know.

01:17:55.381 --> 01:17:56.381
Hey, I'm not the one

01:17:56.421 --> 01:17:59.061
who's got him
bent over the table.

01:17:59.141 --> 01:18:01.301
This is official
police business.

01:18:01.381 --> 01:18:03.261
Carl, what are you
doing here?!

01:18:03.301 --> 01:18:04.461
Where is Jewel?

01:18:04.461 --> 01:18:07.821
It was Just that one time
with me and Jewel, I swear.

01:18:07.941 --> 01:18:09.981
What do you mean,
one time?

01:18:10.101 --> 01:18:11.821
You're lyin'.
She never let you touch her.

01:18:11.941 --> 01:18:14.581
Yeah, not like you,
her "boyfriend."

01:18:14.661 --> 01:18:16.701
Do you believe that?
He calls himself Jewel's boyfriend!

01:18:16.741 --> 01:18:17.741
I'm warning you.

01:18:17.861 --> 01:18:18.861
Where is she?!

01:18:18.901 --> 01:18:20.861
I was expecting her
here any minute!

01:18:20.941 --> 01:18:23.381
Why do you think I'm dressed like this,
for Halloween?

01:18:23.501 --> 01:18:25.301
You're dressed like that
because your perverted cousin --

01:18:25.341 --> 01:18:27.621
Wait a minute.
We gotta find her!

01:18:27.701 --> 01:18:29.901
You are violating a restraining order
and are under arrest!

01:18:30.021 --> 01:18:31.261
You don't understand.

01:18:31.341 --> 01:18:33.301
Someone is coming here
to kill her!

01:18:33.301 --> 01:18:34.101
Him?

01:18:34.101 --> 01:18:35.861
Huh?

01:18:35.981 --> 01:18:37.261
No.

01:18:49.501 --> 01:18:51.661
Which one of you homos

01:18:51.741 --> 01:18:53.381
killed my brother?

01:18:53.501 --> 01:18:55.301
I'm not gay --

01:18:55.381 --> 01:18:57.101
Shut up!

01:18:57.101 --> 01:18:59.861
I understand the man
that killed my brother, Utah,

01:18:59.981 --> 01:19:00.861
he lives here.

01:19:00.861 --> 01:19:03.061
And I'm not leaving
'till I kill him.

01:19:03.061 --> 01:19:05.061
Now, which one of you was it?

01:19:06.821 --> 01:19:08.061
I said, which one of you

01:19:08.061 --> 01:19:09.461
was it!?

01:19:10.901 --> 01:19:12.981
I-I-I'm an attorney.

01:19:13.101 --> 01:19:16.101
I'm sure you and your brother
were very close -- that's good.

01:19:16.261 --> 01:19:18.981
Avenging his death,
wanting to avenge his death,

01:19:19.101 --> 01:19:20.861
that's admirable,
who doesn't understand that?

01:19:20.861 --> 01:19:22.981
But as a lawyer...

01:19:24.141 --> 01:19:25.581
What the hell?

01:19:25.581 --> 01:19:27.101
Jewel:
You want to explain to me

01:19:27.181 --> 01:19:28.421
what you're doing

01:19:28.501 --> 01:19:30.581
looking through
the window of my house?

01:19:30.661 --> 01:19:32.101
Give me your gun.

01:19:33.621 --> 01:19:35.701
I lost my dog, uh --

01:19:35.861 --> 01:19:37.061
he came off his leash.

01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:53.821
And you need
a .357 for that?

01:19:53.861 --> 01:19:56.661
Well, it's
a rough neighborhood...

01:19:56.701 --> 01:19:58.701
...Jewel.

01:20:00.421 --> 01:20:02.101
You should know that.

01:20:05.141 --> 01:20:06.741
Look at these guys.

01:20:06.821 --> 01:20:08.221
Carl:
Legally, you're swimming

01:20:08.301 --> 01:20:09.781
against the current here,

01:20:09.821 --> 01:20:11.421
but you've got
think about the fact

01:20:11.421 --> 01:20:13.221
that if you kill
all three of us,

01:20:13.261 --> 01:20:14.501
you will be adding here,
and I'm Just guessing,

01:20:14.621 --> 01:20:16.101
a second and possibly
third strike

01:20:16.101 --> 01:20:17.461
to your record.

01:20:17.541 --> 01:20:18.461
Which would be
heading you

01:20:18.541 --> 01:20:20.141
to some very serious prison time.

01:20:20.981 --> 01:20:23.701
You I'll kill
Just for annoying me.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:25.861
Now, I would appreciate

01:20:25.981 --> 01:20:28.221
if the man that
killed my brother Utah

01:20:28.301 --> 01:20:30.701
would step forward
and take responsibility

01:20:30.861 --> 01:20:31.981
for their actions,

01:20:32.061 --> 01:20:34.781
or I will have
no other choice

01:20:34.821 --> 01:20:37.661
than to kill all you damn...

01:20:37.781 --> 01:20:39.461
...Village People!

01:20:39.581 --> 01:20:42.501
Now... somebody

01:20:42.541 --> 01:20:44.861
better damn well

01:20:44.861 --> 01:20:48.101
start talkin'!

01:20:48.101 --> 01:20:49.101
Aaah!

01:20:49.221 --> 01:20:51.101
Aah!

01:21:27.861 --> 01:21:29.781
Lord, please don't let them
find me in this outfit!

01:21:51.821 --> 01:21:53.861
Aaahh!

01:24:10.181 --> 01:24:12.981
I'm really gonna
miss that little house.

01:24:13.061 --> 01:24:15.021
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

01:24:15.101 --> 01:24:16.221
When I'm on the road
a few days

01:24:16.261 --> 01:24:17.741
I really
miss my place.

01:24:17.821 --> 01:24:19.861
You have a house?

01:24:19.861 --> 01:24:22.621
Oh, yeah --
I'm a real homebody.

01:24:22.741 --> 01:24:25.701
Nothin' I like better than stayin' home
on a quiet night

01:24:25.821 --> 01:24:28.581
watchin' a good movie on my DVD.

01:24:28.621 --> 01:24:30.821
You have a DVD?

01:24:32.261 --> 01:24:34.701
If you're gonna have a first-rate
home entertainment center,

01:24:34.821 --> 01:24:36.341
you gotta have a DVD.

01:24:41.221 --> 01:24:43.501
Not that my place doesn't need
some fixin' up.

01:24:45.421 --> 01:24:48.261
Hell, I was even thinking
about putting in a fountain.

01:24:50.061 --> 01:24:51.421
Yeah.

01:25:05.021 --> 01:25:06.661
