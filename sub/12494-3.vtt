00:03.208 --> 00:05.417
Man, this is so great,
getting to hang out with you.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.250
I forgot how cool you are.

00:07.333 --> 00:09.208
Aww. Ivy, you are so sweet.

00:09.250 --> 00:11.083
I love hanging out with you too.

00:11.166 --> 00:12.959
Shh! I'm on video chat.

00:15.041 --> 00:18.375
Oh! Hey, Ivy, did you see this email
from our guidance counselor?

00:18.834 --> 00:21.291
Mm-mm. If it's from school,
it goes straight to my spam.

00:22.792 --> 00:25.000
Well, this is about
our community service requirement.

00:25.083 --> 00:27.542
If we don't get this done,
we don't graduate next year.

00:27.625 --> 00:30.667
See? This is why
I don't open emails from school.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.417
They always stress me out.

00:34.959 --> 00:36.875
Oh, no, it gets worse.

00:36.959 --> 00:39.333
See, because we waited so long,
there are only two jobs left.

00:39.417 --> 00:41.417
The first one includes
helping old people--

00:41.500 --> 00:44.083
- Pass.
- But you didn't let me finish.

00:44.166 --> 00:45.875
You lost me at "old people."

00:47.375 --> 00:49.125
So what's the other one?

00:49.250 --> 00:52.250
Interning at K-QUI,
that public radio station.

00:52.458 --> 00:56.083
You mean the one where
everyone talks like this.

00:57.750 --> 01:00.041
Yes. Yes, that's the one.

01:01.125 --> 01:03.000
Man, I hate that station.

01:03.083 --> 01:05.667
Well, would you rather bathe old people?

01:06.542 --> 01:08.000

Hey, Bob, honey, I have a great idea.

02:06.166 --> 02:08.041
- We should have a baby--
- No!

02:10.125 --> 02:11.583
No more babies!

02:13.083 --> 02:14.834
Would you let me finish?

02:14.917 --> 02:17.834
I was going to say
we should have a baby shower.

02:17.917 --> 02:18.917
Oh.

02:21.083 --> 02:23.667
You should really run your words
together a little faster.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.208
Is a baby shower even
appropriate for a fifth kid?

02:28.291 --> 02:30.750
It is when you gave away
all your other baby stuff

02:30.834 --> 02:32.542
because you were absolutely certain

02:32.625 --> 02:34.291
you weren't gonna have another one.

02:37.083 --> 02:38.750
What are you looking at me for?

02:38.834 --> 02:40.834
What are you looking at me for?

02:42.458 --> 02:43.667
So...

02:43.750 --> 02:45.959
Throwing yourself a baby shower, huh?

02:46.041 --> 02:48.500
I am not throwing myself a baby shower.

02:48.583 --> 02:50.083
That's tacky.

02:50.166 --> 02:53.375
I just need, uh, to trick someone
into throwing it for me.

02:55.375 --> 02:58.375
But who?

03:00.125 --> 03:02.250
Oh, don't worry. I'll get it.

03:06.667 --> 03:09.333
- Hi.
- Mary Lou Wentz.

03:09.417 --> 03:11.125
Come on in.

03:11.208 --> 03:14.000
Thank you, Amy.

03:14.083 --> 03:15.917
I was just talking to Bob about you.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.792
- Really?
- I was just telling him

03:17.875 --> 03:19.500
how you're my very best friend.

03:19.583 --> 03:20.875
Oh.

03:22.959 --> 03:24.375
And you're--

03:26.333 --> 03:29.291
I'm just here to pick up Ivy.

03:29.333 --> 03:31.291
Mary Lou, what's the rush?

03:31.375 --> 03:33.375
Have a seat. Take a load off.

03:33.458 --> 03:35.917
Oh, I think I'm just gonna
leave you two alone.

03:39.041 --> 03:42.959
So what's my best friend up to?

03:44.667 --> 03:46.208
That would be you.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.625
Oh, right, right.

03:49.709 --> 03:51.750
Well, not much.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.208
Great, great.

03:53.291 --> 03:55.041
Well, you know,
if you want something to do,

03:55.125 --> 03:57.750
you could throw a baby shower
for your best friend.

03:59.542 --> 04:01.458
That would be me.

04:02.041 --> 04:04.417
Oh. A baby shower?

04:04.500 --> 04:06.417
Yes, doesn't it sound fun?

04:06.500 --> 04:08.333
Okay, I will do all the work.

04:08.417 --> 04:10.542
All you have to do is show up and host it.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.625
Okay, I guess I could do that.

04:12.709 --> 04:13.792
Great.

04:14.375 --> 04:17.542
Oh, and I want it to be a surprise.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.625
But you already know about it.

04:22.709 --> 04:25.125
I mean we're talking about it right now.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.750
Oh, Mary Lou...

04:28.834 --> 04:30.583
...honey, I'm an incredible actress.

04:30.667 --> 04:34.250
Try me. Just, umm, tell me something sad.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.208
Um, your dog is sick.

04:37.291 --> 04:40.125
What? No!

04:40.208 --> 04:42.417
I can't bear it!

04:42.500 --> 04:46.917
No! Why? Oh, why?

04:49.375 --> 04:51.166
Ivy!

04:59.709 --> 05:01.125
Hey.

05:01.709 --> 05:04.250
Great news!
My friend Richie's got a kidney stone.

05:04.333 --> 05:06.000
Yes! Yeah!

05:08.375 --> 05:09.959
Wait. Why is that great news?

05:10.041 --> 05:12.834
Because he can't use his front-row tickets
to the hockey game

05:12.917 --> 05:15.709
which means I get to go
and I get to bring one of you.

05:15.792 --> 05:17.667
- Both: Oh! Take me! Take me!
- Okay, all right.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.166
You guys need to work this out,

05:19.250 --> 05:20.667
because I can't pick a favorite.

05:21.750 --> 05:22.875
I mean, I've got one,

05:22.959 --> 05:24.917
I just can't say who it is.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.500
Okay. Hey, I've got an idea.

05:29.583 --> 05:32.166
Um, we'll flip a coin, all right?

05:32.250 --> 05:34.667
Heads I win, tails you lose.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.166
No, no. No, no, no.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.583
I'm not sure what's wrong about that,

05:38.667 --> 05:40.083
but I know I'm being tricked.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.458
Okay, um, I'll think of a number
in my head

05:45.834 --> 05:47.959
and we'll guess and see
who comes the closest.

05:48.041 --> 05:50.041
Gabe, I'm not falling for that again.

05:51.208 --> 05:53.458
- Fine.
- Out of curiosity, was it six?

05:53.542 --> 05:55.709
- Yup.
- Dang it! Mmm!

06:00.709 --> 06:02.750
And now let's take a look

06:02.834 --> 06:04.500
at our national news.

06:04.959 --> 06:07.333
Okay, so remember,

06:07.417 --> 06:10.208
if we're gonna get these jobs,
we've gotta come across as smart.

06:10.291 --> 06:13.625
So we love books, we love opera,

06:13.709 --> 06:15.834
books about opera, operas about books.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.667
Right, got it, got it.

06:17.750 --> 06:19.959
- Yeah.
- Act all brainyish and stuff.

06:20.875 --> 06:22.250
And let me do the talking.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.166
The lower house of the legislature

06:26.250 --> 06:30.542
passed the bill by a vote of 92-68.

06:30.875 --> 06:33.917
And then it was sent to the upper chamber.

06:34.250 --> 06:37.917
More to come on this fast-breaking story.

06:39.834 --> 06:41.834
This is K-QUI,

06:41.917 --> 06:44.166
"The Quiet Station."

06:48.041 --> 06:50.083
- Well, hello, girls.
- Teddy: Hi.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.000
I'm Diane Vanderweis,

06:52.083 --> 06:54.667
station manager, and on-air personality.

06:54.750 --> 06:56.583
Oh, I'm Teddy. Charmed.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.000
And I'm Ivy.

06:59.083 --> 07:02.083
As William Shakespeare once said, "Hello."

07:03.417 --> 07:06.417
Well, I'm sure he did say
that at some point.

07:06.500 --> 07:09.667
Oh, yes, he, he did.
We, uh, looked it up in a book.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.542
And heard it in an opera.

07:12.750 --> 07:14.542
Okay. So tell me,

07:14.625 --> 07:17.208
are you familiar with K-Q-U-I?

07:17.250 --> 07:19.083
- No, what's that?
- Oh, uh...

07:22.125 --> 07:25.000
She's kidding. She knows that K-Q-U-I

07:25.083 --> 07:28.500
is the radio station
that we are in. Right, Ivy?

07:29.125 --> 07:32.083
As William Shakespeare once said, "Yes."

07:33.542 --> 07:35.959
Okay. Have you heard

07:36.041 --> 07:38.875
our award-winning program Fruit Talk ?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.834
Oh, Fruit Talk. Yeah, I, I love that show.

07:41.917 --> 07:46.041
I find it both fruity and talky.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.792
Well, that's great,

07:49.875 --> 07:52.500
because that's the show
you're going to be working on.

07:52.583 --> 07:55.792
Welcome to the K-QUI family, girls.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.375
Thank you, Diane.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.417
We are... We're really very excited.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.417
Mm-hmm. Now can you just
sign this form for school?

08:03.583 --> 08:06.041
I sign that after you do the work.

08:09.875 --> 08:11.500
It was worth a shot.

08:16.875 --> 08:18.500
- Hey.
- Hey, honey.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.834
- What you doing?
- Making out the guest list

08:20.875 --> 08:22.542
for my baby shower.

08:23.875 --> 08:26.041
You're inviting your ex-boss Karen?

08:26.125 --> 08:28.709
- I thought you didn't like her?
- Honey, I can't stand her.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.333
But, you know, she married a rich guy

08:31.417 --> 08:32.875
and that means an expensive present.

08:32.959 --> 08:34.667
I like presents.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.125
Charlie. Please, honey,
don't be greedy, okay?

08:37.208 --> 08:38.625
This party's for Mommy.

08:40.542 --> 08:42.917
Wait. Why is Debbie Dooley
a question mark?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.834
'Cause, honey, I'm not sure
I can handle the voice.

08:45.917 --> 08:49.125
I'm Debbie Dooley. How ya doin'?

08:49.208 --> 08:52.792
Oh, it gives me a headache.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.667
- So you're not inviting her?
- Oh, I'm inviting her.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.041
The girl can bake.
Of course, then you have to hear her say,

08:59.125 --> 09:02.166
"Here's a snickerdoodle,
just for you-dle!"

09:04.375 --> 09:06.625
Now all I have to do
is email this list to Mary Lou,

09:06.709 --> 09:08.834
and then she can reply
with a bunch of smiley faces.

09:08.917 --> 09:10.250
Oh, that woman is too perky.

09:12.041 --> 09:13.667
Okay, so we've got...

09:13.750 --> 09:15.750
We got too perky, we got too annoying

09:15.834 --> 09:17.625
and we got somebody that you can't stand.

09:17.709 --> 09:19.333
This sounds like an awful party.

09:19.417 --> 09:22.333
Bob, please, these are my dearest friends
you're talking about.

09:29.667 --> 09:30.792
Hey, Dad.

09:34.834 --> 09:36.041
PJ.

09:36.834 --> 09:38.667
- You're looking well.
- Mmm.

09:39.291 --> 09:41.125
Hey, great news,

09:41.208 --> 09:43.041
Gabe and I worked it out, and we decided

09:43.125 --> 09:45.000
that I would be going
to the game with you.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.208
- Just you.
- Mm-hmm. That's right.

09:48.291 --> 09:49.458
Mmm.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.250
Hey.

09:52.709 --> 09:54.875
Guys, I'm sorry.
I can only take one of you.

09:54.959 --> 09:56.417
- Take me.
- No, no, take me.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.041
- I love you more.
- No, I love you more.

09:58.125 --> 09:59.542
- Hey, hey, hey!
- No, I love you more.

09:59.625 --> 10:02.625
I have dreamed of you guys
having this argument--

10:02.709 --> 10:06.041
just not while you're wearing
the same pants.

10:13.125 --> 10:15.458
I'm Debbie Dooley. How ya doin'?

10:15.542 --> 10:17.375
Mary Lou Wentz. Welcome.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.083
Sorry I'm late.

10:19.166 --> 10:21.125
The commute was a bear.

10:21.208 --> 10:23.458
Oh. I thought you lived across the street.

10:23.542 --> 10:25.458
I do. Gotcha!

10:27.709 --> 10:30.375
- Here comes Amy!
- Ooh! Everybody hide!

10:30.417 --> 10:33.458
Oh, my goodness. This is so exciting.

10:33.542 --> 10:35.834
I don't know where to--

10:38.542 --> 10:40.875
Women: Surprise!

10:40.959 --> 10:42.959
What... what is this?

10:43.041 --> 10:45.083
A party for me?

10:45.166 --> 10:47.333
I... I don't know what to say.

10:47.834 --> 10:50.750
Oh, my gosh, this is so funny.

10:50.834 --> 10:53.125
You guys really got me.

10:55.458 --> 10:57.291
And now I'm getting emotional.

10:57.375 --> 10:58.500
Debbie: Aww.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.125
A shower?

11:01.208 --> 11:03.041
For my fifth baby?

11:03.709 --> 11:05.917
It almost seems inappropriate.

11:06.542 --> 11:08.625
That's what I thought
when I got the invite.

11:09.542 --> 11:12.709
Oh, Karen, I'm so glad you could make it.

11:12.792 --> 11:15.959
Oh, well, I've been getting invited
to a lot of things lately.

11:16.041 --> 11:18.709
You know, I, I don't know if you've heard,
but I married well.

11:18.792 --> 11:22.041
Oh, yes. Yeah, it's very sparkly as well.

11:22.125 --> 11:23.750
I'm just glad to have your present...

11:23.834 --> 11:25.083
uh, you present.

11:25.625 --> 11:27.166
I'm glad you're here.

11:27.709 --> 11:29.875
So, Mary Lou,

11:29.959 --> 11:32.125
what fun shower games did you plan?

11:32.208 --> 11:34.750
Shower games? You said just show up.

11:34.834 --> 11:37.208
Well, a treasure hunt you say?

11:37.291 --> 11:39.000
Oh, wow.

11:39.083 --> 11:42.542
Oh, Mary Lou,
you printed maps and everything?

11:43.458 --> 11:46.709
Wow, Mary Lou, you sure know
how to throw a shower.

11:46.792 --> 11:49.250
Well, I put a lot of work into it.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.542
Yeah, leave the acting to me.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.667
I'm Mike Cannagher,

11:59.750 --> 12:03.125
and you're listening
to a very special edition

12:03.208 --> 12:04.917
of Fruit Talk.

12:06.625 --> 12:09.208
It's an Apple-palooza.

12:13.125 --> 12:14.750
Mmm-mmm!

12:14.834 --> 12:17.625
Apples, apples, apples.

12:17.709 --> 12:20.542
All different kinds of apples.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.333
Fuji.

12:22.417 --> 12:23.875
Rome.

12:24.583 --> 12:26.291
Pink lady.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.375
McIntosh!

12:29.333 --> 12:30.542
Uh-uh.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.583
I'll never make it
through five hours of this.

12:32.667 --> 12:33.959
Well, we have to, Ivy.

12:34.041 --> 12:36.125
If we don't get that form signed,
we don't graduate.

12:37.250 --> 12:38.875
Mike: Red delicious.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.917
Granny Smith. Braeburn.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.125
Then again, graduation's overrated.

12:44.917 --> 12:47.583
Now I'm kinda wishing
we stayed at the baby shower.

12:47.959 --> 12:50.834
I mean, it looked boring,
but not this boring.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.667
It's gotta get better.

12:55.083 --> 12:56.917
Wait, we're not getting any sound.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.709
Told you it'd get better.

12:59.709 --> 13:01.417
Maybe the mic's dead.

13:02.875 --> 13:04.083
No, Mike's dead.

13:06.291 --> 13:07.709
Mike?

13:14.000 --> 13:16.041
- Feeling better, Mike?
- Oh, I'm fine.

13:16.125 --> 13:18.250
It's just the Apple-palooza.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.000
Too much excitement.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.875
Wait. Mike, before you go, one more thing.

13:23.750 --> 13:24.959
Could you sign this?

13:26.041 --> 13:28.250
Well, you two are gonna have
to do the rest of the show.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.583
- What?
- Oh, don't worry.

13:30.667 --> 13:34.125
- It's only four hours.
- Well, we don't know how to do this.

13:34.208 --> 13:36.041
- You know what an apple is?
- Yes.

13:36.125 --> 13:37.750
You're all set.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.250
You wanted to see us, Dad?

13:47.125 --> 13:51.250
PJ, Gabe, come on down!

13:52.583 --> 13:53.542
What's all this?

13:53.625 --> 13:57.709
You're the next contestants
on Love that Bob.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.125
This is the game where we find out

14:02.208 --> 14:04.333
who knows the most about Bob.

14:04.417 --> 14:07.375
Brought to you by Bob's Bugs Be Gone.

14:09.041 --> 14:12.375
And let's meet our contestants!

14:13.041 --> 14:14.500
I'm PJ.

14:14.583 --> 14:16.583
Gabe.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.959
Love that enthusiasm.

14:22.375 --> 14:25.417
All right. PJ, Gabe,

14:25.500 --> 14:27.375
I'm going to ask you a series of questions

14:27.458 --> 14:30.125
about your father,
pest control specialist Bob Duncan.

14:30.208 --> 14:32.000
Whoever winds up
with the most correct answers

14:32.083 --> 14:34.667
wins a ticket to a hockey game.

14:34.750 --> 14:37.041
Ooh.

14:37.375 --> 14:40.041
All right, let's dive right in.

14:40.125 --> 14:41.333
Question one.

14:41.959 --> 14:44.458
- "What is Bob's"--
- Donuts!

14:48.125 --> 14:49.917
Correct!

14:50.000 --> 14:52.208
Second question--

14:52.250 --> 14:53.500
Pizza.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.709
Yeah.

14:56.792 --> 14:59.875
Let's move on from the food category.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.917
Okay, here's... here's an easy one.

15:05.333 --> 15:09.000
"What is Bob's middle name?"

15:17.000 --> 15:19.125
Looking for a middle name.

15:23.709 --> 15:24.834
All right, time's up.

15:24.917 --> 15:26.667
It's William. Moving on.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.375
"William Moving On"?

15:28.875 --> 15:30.875
Yeesh, what a terrible name.

15:30.959 --> 15:32.375
It's no wonder you never use it.

15:32.792 --> 15:35.041
I can't possibly lose this thing.

15:36.250 --> 15:39.125
Okay, here's another easy one.

15:39.917 --> 15:42.709
"How old is Bob?"

15:42.792 --> 15:44.041
Fift--

15:44.125 --> 15:45.792
Hey.

15:46.208 --> 15:48.208
- Six--
- No, no, no.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.667
- Seven--
- All right, next question!

15:54.625 --> 15:56.417
When is Bob's birthday?

16:01.500 --> 16:04.375
Oh, come on, you guys.
You gotta know this one.

16:04.375 --> 16:05.709
January 1st.

16:09.208 --> 16:12.250
January 2nd.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.959
January 3rd.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.250
January 4th.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.834
Okay, we are now into our...

16:24.834 --> 16:27.625
second hour of Apple-palooza.

16:28.417 --> 16:31.750
Still waiting for that first call.

16:34.917 --> 16:36.625
Oh, just a reminder,

16:36.709 --> 16:38.542
"palooza" means excitement,

16:38.625 --> 16:42.500
and "call" means call.

16:43.333 --> 16:44.750
Anyone.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.333
Anyone at all.

16:47.542 --> 16:50.166
Oh, hey. In fact,
why don't we just go crazy,

16:50.250 --> 16:52.041
open it up to foods of all kinds.

16:52.125 --> 16:53.125
We could talk...

16:53.583 --> 16:56.542
vegetables, steak,

16:56.625 --> 16:59.250
sausage, bacon.

17:00.709 --> 17:03.041
Dad, if you're out there, please call.

17:07.959 --> 17:09.458
Okay, Charlie,

17:09.542 --> 17:11.291
you ready to help Mommy open her presents?

17:11.375 --> 17:14.250
- Yes, Mommy.
- Women: Aww.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.542
I know what you're all thinking.

17:16.625 --> 17:18.959
I make the most adorable children.

17:19.875 --> 17:21.375
And lots of 'em.

17:23.750 --> 17:26.208
Okay, before we do presents,
I'm just gonna run

17:26.291 --> 17:28.166
to the little mommy's room. Be right back.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.667
Oh.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.500
Hmm. Well...

17:32.875 --> 17:34.959
What a pretty girl you are.

17:35.041 --> 17:36.333
My name is Karen.

17:36.417 --> 17:38.458
My mommy don't like you.

17:39.959 --> 17:43.041
Oh. Oh, my. Of course, she does.

17:43.125 --> 17:45.333
Why else would she invite me to the party?

17:45.417 --> 17:46.834
You're rich.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.875
Oh. Mm-hmm.

17:50.959 --> 17:52.208
Well, yes, I am rich,

17:52.291 --> 17:54.625
which means I have a large car

17:54.709 --> 17:57.583
to put my large present into

17:57.667 --> 17:59.792
and drive away!

18:06.583 --> 18:08.333
Well, that was awkward.

18:10.458 --> 18:13.792
I'm certainly glad your mommy likes me.
Huh, Charlie?

18:14.083 --> 18:16.500
My mom says you talk funny.

18:18.625 --> 18:21.333
- Pardon me?
- It hurts her head.

18:22.709 --> 18:24.500
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:26.083 --> 18:28.458
Well, I guess I'll just
take my snickerdoodles

18:28.542 --> 18:29.959
and ski-doodle.

18:30.041 --> 18:32.542
- You're leaving?
- Oh, you betcha.

18:35.250 --> 18:38.875
Uh, Amy, I think you might wanna
hurry it up in there!

18:39.792 --> 18:40.834
Mean.

18:41.542 --> 18:43.166
Stupid.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.625
Smelly.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.458
Bye-bye.

18:53.917 --> 18:56.500
Okay. The topic is now

18:56.583 --> 18:58.625
"Things that exist...

18:59.500 --> 19:01.125
in the world."

19:03.583 --> 19:06.917
Wow, looks like
we're getting an actual call.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.834
Hi, and welcome to Fruit Talk.
Who is this?

19:09.917 --> 19:11.208
It's Ivy.

19:12.625 --> 19:16.250
You do realize we're the only ones
listening to the show, right?

19:16.333 --> 19:17.959
And I'm not even listening.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.917
Well, we still have
three more hours to fill.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.500
- What do you suggest?
- How about this?

19:29.875 --> 19:32.208
Oh, okay.

19:33.709 --> 19:36.208
♪ We tried to talk fruit
We tried some conversation ♪

19:36.250 --> 19:38.875
♪ But the station's so boring
I need a vacation ♪

19:38.959 --> 19:41.792
♪ Listen up, people
This station's a loser ♪

19:41.875 --> 19:44.083
♪ And this whole show
Was an Apple-pa-snooza ♪

19:44.166 --> 19:46.000
♪ Eww, oh ♪

19:46.500 --> 19:49.291
- ♪ This station is sad ♪
- ♪ This station is tired... ♪

19:49.375 --> 19:52.500
Said the two interns who just got fired.

19:57.917 --> 19:59.792
Can you sign this first?

20:06.625 --> 20:07.750
July 7th.

20:07.834 --> 20:09.500
- July 8th.
- July 9th.

20:10.333 --> 20:11.792
All right, you know what?

20:13.125 --> 20:16.750
This, uh... This wasn't as much fun
as I thought it was gonna be.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.333
I think I'm gonna ask somebody else
to go to the hockey game.

20:21.417 --> 20:24.375
Whoa. Wait, wait, Dad,
just let me say something.

20:24.834 --> 20:25.875
July 10th.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.583
This shower was a total disaster.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.166
I guess Charlie understands
more than I thought.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.542
I'm sorry, Mama.

20:41.625 --> 20:45.000
- Oh.
- Honey, it's okay.

20:45.417 --> 20:47.750
It's okay. It's not your fault.

20:47.834 --> 20:49.542
Amy: It's not anybody's fault.

20:49.625 --> 20:52.291
- Well, actually--
- It's not anybody's fault, Mary Lou.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.917
- Okay.
- Now would you like a cup of tea?

20:55.000 --> 20:57.125
- Yes, I would love that.
- Okay.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.625
Okay, spill it, Charlie.

21:00.709 --> 21:02.041
What did she say about me?

21:03.750 --> 21:05.750
Maybe you should come with me.

21:14.208 --> 21:18.000
Well, Charlie, Ivy and I are looking
for a new internship.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.625
And... Oh!

21:19.709 --> 21:23.041
I guess we have to be more careful
with what we say around you.

21:23.125 --> 21:26.667
Otherwise, people might
find out they're too perky.

21:28.709 --> 21:30.625
Are you here to pick up Ivy, Mrs. Wentz?

21:30.709 --> 21:33.709
No, I'm just really annoyed.

21:35.709 --> 21:36.750
All righty, then.

21:36.834 --> 21:38.458
Bob: Okay, Teddy, come on! Let's go.

21:38.542 --> 21:40.375
So I'm going to my first hockey game,

21:40.458 --> 21:43.750
'cause I was the only kid who knew
when Dad's birthday is.

21:44.417 --> 21:46.875
Okay, running a little late.

21:46.959 --> 21:48.750
Gonna have to paint your face in the car.

21:51.709 --> 21:54.458
Yay, I'm the winner.

21:56.375 --> 21:58.000
Wish me good luck, Charlie.

22:03.458 --> 22:04.542
Hey, Mom.

22:04.625 --> 22:06.542
Oh, there's my little tyke.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.458
How ya doin'?

22:13.458 --> 22:14.875
Mom, you feeling okay?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.583
Super good and gettin' better.

22:19.667 --> 22:21.041
Why are you talking like that?

22:21.125 --> 22:22.917
Like what?

22:24.208 --> 22:26.083
Oh, funny thing.

22:26.166 --> 22:28.917
I was taking a walk today
with Debbie Dooley

22:29.000 --> 22:31.208
and we found a magic potion.

22:31.875 --> 22:35.625
Well, naturally we each took a sip,

22:36.792 --> 22:38.542
but nothing happened.

22:40.041 --> 22:42.291
Uh, Mom, something did happen.

22:42.375 --> 22:44.041
We need to fix this.

22:44.125 --> 22:47.166
Nothing to fix, Mr. Bossy-Pants.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.375
Snickerdoodle?

22:52.458 --> 22:54.291
Oh, yeah, you're right. We are good.

22:54.834 --> 22:56.333
Are we?

22:56.458 --> 22:58.000
You betcha.
