01:29.190 --> 01:31.058
No. Please stop.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.426
What's wrong?

01:32.560 --> 01:36.497
That noise hurts my ears,
and you don't need pencils.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.366
Our orders
are electronically entered.

01:39.367 --> 01:42.035
I use pencil
when I'm doing research.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.837
Congratulations.

01:43.971 --> 01:47.741
I come bearing gifts
for our new attending surgeons.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.310
Bummer
you have to share an office,

01:49.443 --> 01:52.346
but I can make sure
your first day
starts with a smile.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.249
Is it noise-canceling earbuds?

01:55.383 --> 01:56.650
It is not.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.586
You guys are
big decision-makers now.

01:58.719 --> 01:59.787
Figured you might need
some help.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.124
<i>But of course!</i>

02:06.194 --> 02:08.329
<i>Sounds like a brilliant idea!</i>

02:09.697 --> 02:12.065
- Eh?
- Is the answer always yes?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.267
I don't know. Ask.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.469
Is the answer always yes?

02:15.603 --> 02:16.504
<i>Tequila stat!</i>

02:16.637 --> 02:17.438
Oh!

02:18.806 --> 02:20.174
Am I awesome or what?

02:20.308 --> 02:22.610
- You are awesome.
- Mm.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.978
But tequila can't be
the answer to everything.

02:25.112 --> 02:26.514
I would not be so sure.

02:32.453 --> 02:34.288
Uh, Lim is in the parking lot.

02:35.055 --> 02:35.623
Hmm.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.592
You-- You okay?

02:39.593 --> 02:40.761
Yes.

02:40.894 --> 02:41.662
Why wouldn't I be?

02:58.612 --> 03:00.614
Whoo!

03:03.917 --> 03:04.985
Welcome back, Chief.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.620
Thank you.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.489
I've never been
this happy to be at work.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.191
- We've missed you so much.
- Ah.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.361
It's only been a few months.

03:13.494 --> 03:15.629
It's been 14 and a half weeks.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.633
Awkward.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.602
Her and Murphy.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.604
It's awkward between
Murphy and most people.

03:23.737 --> 03:24.905
He didn't paralyze everyone.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.040
He didn't paralyze her.
He saved her life.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.777
If he would've done the surgery
Glassman ordered him to do--

03:29.910 --> 03:32.413
There's no way to know what
the outcome would have been.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.681
The M&M was clear on that.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.449
The final determination
was "inconclusive."

03:37.585 --> 03:39.653
I'd hug you, but I'd have
to steal your wheelchair.

03:39.787 --> 03:41.154
Oh, no. What happened?

03:41.289 --> 03:42.823
Oh, I lifted
the front end of a bus,

03:42.956 --> 03:44.692
you know, to save a kid.
Normal Monday.

03:45.793 --> 03:46.827
Got to lift with your legs.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.229
Yeah.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.932
So, I tried to keep
your inbox empty,
but that was impossible.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.069
Everybody, party's over.
She's got work to do.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.741
Well, no, actually,
um, before you go,

04:01.942 --> 04:03.577
I just want to thank you

04:03.711 --> 04:06.414
for the flowers,
the food, everything.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.582
It was incredibly helpful.

04:10.784 --> 04:13.687
And I'd like to thank
Dr. Murphy.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.359
You saved my life.

04:21.962 --> 04:22.763
You're welcome.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.301
Oof. So awkward.

04:41.982 --> 04:44.084
Doctors Wolke and Allen,
meet our new first years,

04:44.217 --> 04:46.420
Doctors Danica Powell
and Daniel Perez.

04:46.554 --> 04:47.921
Newbies.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.690
- Don't call them that.
- Sorry.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.325
Welcome to St. Bonaventure.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.893
Thanks. Glad to be here.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.695
I look forward
to working with you both.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.064
Have a great first day.

04:57.197 --> 04:57.765
Thank you.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.537
Nurse Hawks showed us around,

05:03.671 --> 05:05.739
introduced us to the OR staff.

05:06.774 --> 05:08.275
Everyone seems super helpful.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.810
I'm sure they were.

05:09.943 --> 05:10.944
Hmm.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.913
You want the soldier
or the farmboy?

05:13.046 --> 05:15.282
Naval Academy grads
are called sailors,

05:15.416 --> 05:16.249
not soldiers.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.451
Well, she's been in combat.

05:17.585 --> 05:18.185
That makes her a soldier

05:18.318 --> 05:19.252
in my book.

05:19.387 --> 05:20.488
They both have

05:20.621 --> 05:22.322
excellent USMLE scores.

05:22.456 --> 05:23.256
Well, she has more

05:23.391 --> 05:24.725
real-world experience,

05:24.858 --> 05:26.494
but he'll be useful getting
extra help from the nurses,

05:26.627 --> 05:28.496
which could come in handy
on our first day.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.931
It's not our first day.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.101
We've been here five years
and have leadership experience.

05:34.234 --> 05:36.136
Being an attending
shouldn't be much different

05:36.269 --> 05:37.938
than being a senior resident.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.140
I'll take Handsome Dan.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.510
Okay.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.447
Good morning.

05:46.580 --> 05:47.915
I'm Dr. Shaun Murphy.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.016
I'm an attending

05:49.149 --> 05:50.784
at San Jose
St. Bonaventure Hospital.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.287
You and Dr. Wolke
will be with me today.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.792
Allen and Perez, you're with me
in the ER today.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.728
Actually, I was just about
to take Perez.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.362
You may have been "about to,"
but I just did.

06:02.496 --> 06:03.664
- Come on. Let's go.
- Hold on.

06:03.797 --> 06:04.965
Dr. Murphy and I--

06:05.098 --> 06:06.634
Were decorating
your new shared office,

06:06.767 --> 06:08.301
while I was getting
this approved by Andrews.

06:08.436 --> 06:11.171
Oblivious to
anyone else's needs
but your own, as usual.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.906
Pathetically blaming everyone
else for your problems,

06:13.040 --> 06:13.807
as usual.

06:17.911 --> 06:18.779
They used to be

06:18.912 --> 06:19.747
in a relationship.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.714
It ended badly.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.315
Let's go.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.889
It still
feels like I'm choking.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.661
The EMTs said they could barely
get into your apartment.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.228
Looked like you hadn't
been able to clean up

06:35.362 --> 06:38.165
or take out the trash
in months.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.201
Those are my collections.
It's none of their business.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.205
Large, palpable anterior mass.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.542
When was the last time
you saw a doctor?

06:48.676 --> 06:50.844
I don't know.
Ten, twenty years.

06:54.314 --> 06:55.916
When was the last time
you left your house?

06:56.049 --> 06:57.384
What does that matter?

06:57.518 --> 06:59.687
We just want to make sure
you're taking care of yourself.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.524
If you want,
we could have a social worker

07:03.657 --> 07:05.325
come down to talk to you.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.928
You know, this is exactly why
I don't come to hospitals.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.997
All you want to do
is meddle in things

07:10.130 --> 07:11.699
that are none
of your damn business.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.434
It looks like
you may need some surgery

07:14.568 --> 07:15.769
to remove this mass.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.204
You think
you'd be okay with that?

07:17.337 --> 07:19.106
What the hell
do you think I'm here for?

07:23.010 --> 07:24.277
The donor heart is on its way,

07:24.411 --> 07:26.279
so we need to start
prepping you for surgery.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.182
I see you brought in reinforcements.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.519
Hi. I'm Dr. Danni Powell.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.654
Dr. Powell's
one of our new residents.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.888
This is her first day.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.659
- Oh, and she's assisting?
- Yes.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.594
I don't want a first year
on her first day

07:40.728 --> 07:42.095
in on my husband's
heart transplant.

07:44.598 --> 07:46.800
You're a surgeon yourself.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.169
You are aware
the only way residents learn

07:49.302 --> 07:51.271
difficult surgeries
is by participating in them.

07:51.404 --> 07:55.909
Yes, and I'm also aware that
residencies last five years,

07:56.043 --> 07:58.646
so there's no reason
she needs to do this day one.

07:58.779 --> 08:01.515
Honey, it's okay.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.651
I'm sure Dr. Murphy
knows what he's doing.

08:03.784 --> 08:04.918
Mm.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.921
It's gonna be fine.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.590
How can I be
more worried than you?

08:09.723 --> 08:10.724
You're smarter.

08:11.859 --> 08:12.926
It's part of why I love you.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.129
And hopefully
my new heart will, too.

08:17.931 --> 08:19.667
It definitely
won't change that.

08:27.775 --> 08:28.642
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

08:28.776 --> 08:30.310
Code Blue! I need a cart!

08:32.379 --> 08:33.614
Aah!

08:35.048 --> 08:37.050
I've been
looking for you.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.351
I have a patient in the ER

08:38.485 --> 08:40.353
who needs a mass
removed from his neck.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.155
I need an attending
for Allen and Perez.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.992
Okay. Uh, I'm pretty swamped.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.727
Well, obviously, I wasn't
expecting you to do it,

08:46.860 --> 08:48.128
but Murphy's on a transplant,

08:48.261 --> 08:49.863
Park's busy
decorating his office...

08:49.997 --> 08:52.966
"Obviously"?
Why wouldn't I do it?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.368
I just-- Andrews said--

08:55.502 --> 08:57.671
Surgeries are still done
with our hands, right?

08:57.805 --> 08:59.472
The only thing
that should be <i>obvious</i>

08:59.607 --> 09:01.575
is that I'm not on call,
but Park is,

09:01.709 --> 09:04.177
so get over
your stupid breakup drama
and go talk to him.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.452
So, I'll reschedule your 11:00?

09:12.586 --> 09:14.154
I can fit it in.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.723
Didn't you want to make sure
you had the funding
confirmed first?

09:15.856 --> 09:16.657
Good point.

09:18.125 --> 09:21.194
I will be doing
Mr. Persiko's hernia repair.

09:21.328 --> 09:25.165
Audrey, I'm amazed
by your courage and fortitude,

09:25.298 --> 09:27.868
and I will do
everything in my power
to assist in your return.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.004
But that might not
include surgeries.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.876
I have pretty much lived
at physical therapy

09:36.009 --> 09:37.544
the last three months.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.179
I have practiced extensively

09:39.312 --> 09:40.848
in a custom chair
that holds me upright

09:40.981 --> 09:43.416
so that I can see and reach
the entire surgical field.

09:43.550 --> 09:45.585
You know practicing in PT

09:45.719 --> 09:48.388
is not the same
as working in an OR.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.523
And your office is not the same
as a courtroom,

09:50.658 --> 09:54.027
so I won't bore you
with my rights under the ADA.

09:55.228 --> 09:58.732
I can do all the duties
of chief surgeon.

09:59.900 --> 10:00.868
Okay.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.304
But I'm joining you on Persiko.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.674
There is no reason
the president and chief surgeon

10:06.807 --> 10:08.842
need to tag team
a hernia repair.

10:09.743 --> 10:10.911
Yes, there is.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.086
Heparinization complete.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.789
Bypass initiated.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.857
Cross clamping
the aorta.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.059
And tighten the caval snares.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.062
Dr. Powell,
prep the donor organ.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.397
Check the atrial septum.

10:30.530 --> 10:32.265
Make sure there's
no patent foramen ovale.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.633
Looks good.

10:33.767 --> 10:37.137
The mitral, pulmonic,
and aortic valves also good.

10:37.270 --> 10:39.072
Thank you.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.308
I will transect
the superior vena cava

10:41.441 --> 10:44.411
while you divide the aorta
and pulmonary arteries.

10:44.544 --> 10:47.280
Are you serious?
That's the most difficult part.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.416
Are you confident
you can handle it?

10:49.549 --> 10:50.650
Definitely.

10:50.784 --> 10:51.584
Then so am I.

10:53.721 --> 10:54.487
Potts scissors.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.492
Wait, hold on.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.428
The donor heart
has a floppy tricuspid.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.000
There was
no evidence to suggest

11:07.134 --> 11:09.903
severe tricuspid insufficiency
on the donor's echocardiogram.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.108
The valve is damaged.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.346
That must've happened during
the organ recovery surgery.

11:19.479 --> 11:21.514
We can't replace one
damaged heart with another.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.416
It took three months
to get this one.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.684
He won't last three more.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.286
Aborting now
and putting him on ECMO

11:26.419 --> 11:27.955
would move him
to the top of the wait list.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.991
We should be able to find
a new one in a few days,

11:31.124 --> 11:32.459
a week at most.

11:32.592 --> 11:33.693
You really
want to take that risk?

11:33.827 --> 11:36.864
It's not her decision.
It's mine.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.038
Abort the surgery.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.124
We had to abort the transplant.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.126
The damage was too severe.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.995
We placed him on ECMO
and closed his chest.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.998
He's being transferred to ICU
while we wait for a new donor.

12:12.499 --> 12:15.235
You made that decision
without even consulting me?

12:15.368 --> 12:17.370
It was surgical judgment.

12:17.504 --> 12:18.371
And I'm a surgeon.

12:18.505 --> 12:20.673
Not at this hospital.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.342
Here, you're just
the patient's wife.

12:22.475 --> 12:25.078
"Just"? My husband's life
is in your hands.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.080
I have every right
to ask questions.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.982
Excuse me, Dr. Hall,
may I ask you something?

12:29.116 --> 12:30.017
What?

12:31.418 --> 12:34.888
I understand that you're upset
and frightened,

12:35.022 --> 12:37.590
and you may disagree
with our decision
to abort the transplant.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.693
But we are gonna do everything
in our power

12:40.828 --> 12:42.095
to find a new heart.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.732
Is there any way
that we can help you?

12:45.866 --> 12:49.402
Any pre-op echo
or operative reports
that you'd like to see?

12:49.536 --> 12:51.872
Is there anyone else
that you'd like to talk to?

12:55.075 --> 12:56.109
Can I see him?

12:56.243 --> 12:57.744
Absolutely.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.346
As soon as he's stable
in the ICU,

12:59.479 --> 13:01.214
we'll have a nurse
bring you in.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.084
Anything else
that we can get for you?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.586
Any food or a coffee?

13:08.889 --> 13:10.223
Um, no.

13:13.861 --> 13:14.794
Thank you.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.071
So, what kind of stuff
do you like to collect?

13:26.106 --> 13:27.440
I collect Egyptian pottery.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.542
I got obsessed with King Tut
in elementary school.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.745
I know. My friends all think
it's very odd, too.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.383
Uh, I collect electronics, mostly.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.886
Hi-fi stereo, computers, TVs.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.623
All people care about now
is the next shiny thing.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.792
Use it once,
toss it in the trash.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.095
You go to flea markets
or garage sales?

13:48.228 --> 13:50.864
Mm. They try
to rip you off there.

13:50.998 --> 13:54.501
I can shop
and compare a hundred
different places online,

13:54.634 --> 13:56.469
select what I want, have it
delivered right to my door.

13:57.804 --> 14:00.173
It's just nice
to go out sometimes.

14:00.307 --> 14:03.043
I'm not a hermit or a hoarder.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.177
No one's calling you that.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.678
Everyone calls me that.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.449
Just do your damn test.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.885
Remove the thing,
and I can get out of here.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.294
Okay.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.031
Let me help you.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.265
No, I can do it.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.633
I know, but you've
never had a problem

14:26.766 --> 14:28.301
asking me to scratch your nose
during surgery.

14:29.169 --> 14:30.070
Thanks.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.210
This thing--

14:38.245 --> 14:40.447
I feel slow and awkward.

14:40.580 --> 14:43.016
You're like Ripley in <i>Aliens.</i>

14:43.150 --> 14:44.217
A total badass.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.158
I'm sorry.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.326
You didn't do anything.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.697
I wish I was as strong as you.

14:59.399 --> 15:02.802
I can't sleep.
Still have nightmares.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.704
You're stronger than me.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.341
I'm just a better poker player.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.349
Your bedside manner
is impressive.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.986
I spent two years
in Afghanistan,

15:19.119 --> 15:22.255
so had plenty of practice
de-escalating conflict.

15:25.692 --> 15:28.561
What about a biventricular
assist device?

15:28.695 --> 15:30.463
Could extend the function
of his current heart.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.032
Well, that's pretty short-term.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.501
I was actually thinking--

15:34.634 --> 15:37.537
Okay, he isn't oxygenating
sufficiently despite the ECMO,

15:37.670 --> 15:39.706
and he's bleeding
from his cannula sites.

15:39.839 --> 15:40.940
Have you considered a CARMAT?

15:41.074 --> 15:43.943
We looked into
artificial hearts weeks ago.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.378
He is not a candidate.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.415
I shouldn't have aborted
the transplant.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.884
What about a xenotransplant?

15:54.854 --> 15:57.124
I was just reading a study
about the use of pig hearts.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.391
That's not an option.

15:58.525 --> 15:59.392
Why not?

16:01.594 --> 16:03.896
The most recent patient
lasted two months,

16:04.031 --> 16:06.599
which is longer than
ECMO will keep him alive.

16:06.733 --> 16:07.700
Because it's immoral.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.138
Animals
aren't surgical devices.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.806
They are living beings who have
a right to self-determination.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.812
Well, so was the guy
whose heart we just threw
in the trash a few hours ago.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.382
That man made a free choice
to have his heart removed

16:22.515 --> 16:24.451
after he died.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.653
No one executed him
so they could take it.

16:26.786 --> 16:30.590
We execute millions of pigs
every day for food,

16:30.723 --> 16:33.793
and saving a human life
is more important.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.463
Killing animals for food
or for medicine is wrong.

16:37.730 --> 16:38.431
I won't do it.

16:40.300 --> 16:41.268
Okay.

16:43.570 --> 16:46.906
Dr. Powell, you have no choice.

16:48.408 --> 16:52.279
Refusing to comply
with an attending's decision

16:52.412 --> 16:54.447
would be grounds
for termination.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.451
Everything I've ever done
has been my choice.

17:00.087 --> 17:02.622
So, you can fire me
if you want to,

17:02.755 --> 17:06.326
but I won't participate
in a xenotransplant.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.661
Mm.

17:10.930 --> 17:12.465
So, what are we doing?

17:15.802 --> 17:20.006
As long as his wife consents, xenotransplant.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.042
Right. I will be here
if you need me
for another patient.

17:40.160 --> 17:40.960
Cut.

17:46.399 --> 17:49.068
Can you loosen the top strap
so that I can lean forward
a bit more?

17:51.838 --> 17:52.972
And someone get her brow.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.076
Thank you.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.882
Okay. That should be good.

18:03.916 --> 18:04.884
3-0 vicryl sutures.

18:06.953 --> 18:07.520
Yeah.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.727
- You need help?
You want me to--
- No. I got this.

18:15.728 --> 18:16.529
I got it.

18:29.209 --> 18:29.742
It's okay.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.545
This is a damn hernia repair.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.214
I should be able to do it
in my sleep.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.315
Metz scissors.

18:47.860 --> 18:48.728
You okay?

18:57.237 --> 18:59.739
No. Take over.

19:08.848 --> 19:09.582
Metz.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.525
The mass has completely grown
into the larynx.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.293
With possible
bilateral involvement.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.761
We should
still be able to excise

19:21.894 --> 19:23.496
without doing any more damage
to his voice.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.799
I-I don't think the patient
cares about his voice.

19:26.933 --> 19:29.502
He's not interested
in talking to anyone.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.271
Or he just likes solitude.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.173
I used to spend
every summer alone

19:34.307 --> 19:37.176
in the cab of a combine,
and I loved it.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.680
So, Mister-Already-
Knows-Every-Nurse-By-Name
is a lone wolf?

19:40.813 --> 19:41.914
I don't buy it.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.816
Our lone wolf
has refused a psych consult,

19:43.950 --> 19:45.885
so we should focus
on what we can actually fix.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.887
- I agree.
- Then let me finish.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.490
We need a laryngoscopy
to assess the compression

19:50.623 --> 19:52.124
from the mass
on his vocal cords.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.693
I disagree.

19:53.826 --> 19:55.127
Better to do
a needle aspiration
to assess malignancy.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.798
He's my patient. Laryngoscopy.

19:58.931 --> 20:00.367
But I'm the attending.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.701
Needle aspiration.

20:05.638 --> 20:06.639
We could do both.

20:08.174 --> 20:08.808
Fine.

20:09.776 --> 20:10.643
Sure.

20:21.120 --> 20:22.855
The chief of surgery
is responsible

20:22.989 --> 20:24.991
for a lot more
than just cutting.

20:25.124 --> 20:27.226
I'm not giving up just because
I failed on my first try.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.028
That wasn't what
I was suggesting.

20:31.364 --> 20:32.164
I'm just...

20:33.666 --> 20:34.434
impatient.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.537
I screwed up, which could've
endangered a patient.

20:39.205 --> 20:41.574
You should be pissed off at me,
not giving me a damn pep talk.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.184
Do I have the power
to fire residents?

20:52.319 --> 20:53.886
Yes.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.423
I have
a heart transplant patient
who is rapidly deteriorating--

20:56.556 --> 20:59.859
Stop. You're now an attending.

20:59.992 --> 21:03.229
You need to learn how to make
tough decisions on your own.

21:17.143 --> 21:18.678
- Good job.
- Mm.

21:18.811 --> 21:19.979
Now breathe.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.714
Two-minute rest
and we'll do one more.

21:23.215 --> 21:24.283
Hey.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.918
What are you doing here?

21:26.052 --> 21:27.720
Oh, looking for a heating pad.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.389
Or is it ice?
I never know which one.

21:29.522 --> 21:31.090
Ah, nobody does.

21:31.223 --> 21:33.225
Judging from your walk,
I'd say you need
a lot more than that.

21:33.360 --> 21:36.062
She's right. And the real
problem's not your back.

21:36.195 --> 21:38.631
It's your shoulders.
Your posture's all slumped.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.299
I see that a lot
in my older clients.

21:40.433 --> 21:41.834
Oh. Well, thank you.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.970
I fell into a trench
during World War I.

21:45.572 --> 21:46.739
I'm gonna get you a bolster.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.643
How you doing?

21:50.777 --> 21:52.745
Other than having to tap out
of a hernia repair?

21:53.880 --> 21:54.747
Fantastic.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.817
Standing's a lot harder
than it looks.

21:58.685 --> 21:59.886
So don't.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.454
Do the surgery from your chair.

22:02.221 --> 22:03.356
Well, unlike Murphy,

22:03.490 --> 22:05.124
I have to be over the patient
to see inside.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.960
So lower the patient.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.430
That would throw a bunch
of things out of sync,

22:10.563 --> 22:11.931
the staff, the table.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.533
You're the chief.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.768
Let them sync up with you, Chief.

22:24.243 --> 22:25.712
The doctor's password
is irrelevant.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.780
The patients have their own
separate login ID.

22:27.914 --> 22:30.583
You say irrelevant,
yet the patients can't log in.

22:30.717 --> 22:32.985
They have to reset their
password every time they try.

22:33.119 --> 22:34.086
Damn it.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.490
I need some advice.

22:37.624 --> 22:39.158
And I need an epidural.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.192
And I need a new tech.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.661
This guy's coding
is a total mess.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.298
I'm doing a xenotransplant,

22:46.433 --> 22:48.435
but my new resident
refuses to participate.

22:48.568 --> 22:49.669
She think it's immoral.

22:49.802 --> 22:52.171
Dr. Andrews said
I have the power to fire her,

22:52.304 --> 22:54.741
but I am not sure if I should.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.342
Mm, if she's this defiant
on day one,

22:56.476 --> 22:58.177
it's only gonna get worse.

22:58.310 --> 23:01.313
You have been defiant
to your attendings, right?

23:02.449 --> 23:04.617
Surgery you did on Lim
as an example.

23:05.452 --> 23:06.619
That's different.

23:06.753 --> 23:09.221
My decision
in Dr. Lim's surgery was right.

23:09.355 --> 23:11.223
Dr. Powell, clearly wrong.

23:11.357 --> 23:12.825
Your decision
left her paralyzed.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.393
He's not here to discuss Lim.

23:15.695 --> 23:19.231
Your newbie is trouble
in all caps. Fire her.

23:19.365 --> 23:21.367
I'd like to remind you
it's her first day.

23:21.501 --> 23:22.702
It's also <i>your</i> first day.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.270
Take a minute, think about it.

23:27.674 --> 23:30.209
Thank you for your help.

23:30.342 --> 23:33.012
You have much more leadership
experience than Lea does.

23:35.047 --> 23:36.483
But I trust her more.

23:37.383 --> 23:39.351
I'm going to fire Dr. Powell.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.530
It's a pig.

23:50.663 --> 23:51.531
It's a life.

23:53.132 --> 23:56.135
Animals feel pain and fear.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.038
They have emotions,
just like humans.

23:59.171 --> 24:02.274
Every drug we take
gets tested on animals first.
Are you against that too?

24:03.009 --> 24:04.577
Call me a hypocrite,

24:04.711 --> 24:07.446
but I believe that
there is a difference
between a rat and a pig.

24:08.548 --> 24:09.782
And as soon
as the tech advances,

24:09.916 --> 24:11.884
we should stop using rats, too.

24:12.719 --> 24:14.654
Didn't you fight in a war?

24:14.787 --> 24:16.455
You're okay
with killing for your country,

24:16.589 --> 24:18.090
but won't sacrifice a pig
for your patient?

24:19.225 --> 24:20.693
I was never okay with killing.

24:22.161 --> 24:25.431
And only somebody who's never
been in the military

24:25.565 --> 24:28.100
or known somebody who has been

24:28.234 --> 24:30.637
would say something so idiotic.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.071
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

24:33.873 --> 24:35.274
I need to speak
with Dr. Powell.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.081
The pig heart's here.
We need to go.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.519
We will finish this later.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.797
Pull it back a little.
You went past the cords.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.434
Wish there was a way
we could reach this guy.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.136
At least get him to go outside

25:04.270 --> 25:06.505
and stop trying
to fill his loneliness

25:06.639 --> 25:07.840
with electronic junk.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.679
When my grandma died,
I saved her sweaters

25:12.812 --> 25:14.814
because they smelled
like her pipe tobacco.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.651
That's... interesting,

25:18.785 --> 25:20.953
on a number of levels.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.922
But your grandma's sweaters
are obviously different

25:23.055 --> 25:24.857
than a stack of broken TVs
and receivers.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.160
And you're handsome... enough.

25:28.294 --> 25:30.129
You don't need to go on about
how much you love your grandma.

25:31.263 --> 25:31.964
Already flirting.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.367
He's only been here
a few hours.

25:35.501 --> 25:37.503
Have you at least finished
the scope first?

25:37.637 --> 25:38.638
Finishing up.

25:38.771 --> 25:41.173
I'll export the images
to his chart.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.976
And we were definitely
not flirting.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.878
Absolutely not.

25:46.012 --> 25:47.513
I usually wait
till the second day
on the job for that.

25:56.689 --> 25:57.489
Needle nose.

25:58.490 --> 25:59.892
Oh.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.261
I always thought
the needle nose

26:02.394 --> 26:03.996
was the unsung hero
of the toolbox.

26:09.435 --> 26:10.302
Got it.

26:14.040 --> 26:14.807
Awesome.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.243
Actually, not awesome.

26:18.978 --> 26:21.781
Even with all the covers off,
your knees won't fit under.

26:21.914 --> 26:22.915
Damn it.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.484
What if you took
the motor out totally?

26:25.618 --> 26:28.755
OR nurses can manually
raise and lower the table
without the motor.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.857
It's not the motor.
It's the frame,

26:30.990 --> 26:32.591
which is welded to the table.

26:33.893 --> 26:35.194
Which means I'm screwed.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.763
We can figure this out.

26:39.699 --> 26:40.800
I gotta go.

26:40.933 --> 26:43.870
Thanks for your efforts,
but this isn't happening.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.443
Where is the cooler?

26:51.577 --> 26:53.145
- Cooler?
- We thought you were
bringing the heart.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.146
I am.

27:00.019 --> 27:02.388
We've found that patient
outcomes were much better

27:02.521 --> 27:04.891
if the heart remained in vivo
until the last possible moment.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.060
Sign here, please.

27:09.595 --> 27:13.465
For specimen A71923?

27:13.599 --> 27:15.634
We're not supposed
to name the specimens,

27:15.768 --> 27:18.270
but we call him Wilbur.

27:21.273 --> 27:22.074
Okay.

27:29.548 --> 27:30.149
Come along, Wilbur.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.096
We need a pre-op ECHO.

27:46.398 --> 27:48.300
How? He's covered in hair.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.771
How do you think?

27:53.940 --> 27:55.207
Is it okay?
They want to see him.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.476
I'm sorry. We have to
prep him for surgery.

27:57.609 --> 27:59.478
It is okay.

27:59.611 --> 28:01.981
You can do that
while they pet him.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.328
Why does he need an operation?

28:16.462 --> 28:20.632
Well, he is giving his heart
to another one of our patients.

28:20.767 --> 28:23.002
But how will he live
if he gives his heart away?

28:23.135 --> 28:24.503
No.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.138
He can't.

28:27.373 --> 28:28.374
He is going to die.

28:30.977 --> 28:31.710
Mm.

28:34.146 --> 28:35.047
Dr. Lim.

28:36.182 --> 28:37.149
Dr. Lim.

28:38.650 --> 28:41.053
- This better be fast.
- It will be.

28:41.187 --> 28:43.923
I thought I should let you know
that I am firing Dr. Powell.

28:44.590 --> 28:46.358
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.460
Uh, mind if I ask why?

28:48.594 --> 28:49.796
Oh.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.731
She refused to participate
in the xenotransplant.

28:52.865 --> 28:57.336
She thinks using animals
for medical procedures
or research is immoral.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.907
That's an odd opinion
for someone

29:01.040 --> 29:02.909
who wants a career in medicine.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.543
But it's not your job
as an attending

29:04.676 --> 29:06.312
to weed out the bad residents.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.281
It's to mentor
and mold them into...

29:15.855 --> 29:17.890
It's okay.

29:18.024 --> 29:19.225
Wilbur is very friendly.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.228
Good talk. I gotta go.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.840
We finally figured out
how to lower the light.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.174
Still haven't solved
the table issue.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.709
I have. Scrap the whole thing.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.311
And do surgery
sitting on the floor?

29:39.445 --> 29:43.215
No. On a sturdy,
stainless-steel table
that sits on four legs

29:43.349 --> 29:44.783
instead of a bulky pedestal.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.118
Like they have
at my butcher shop.

29:47.253 --> 29:48.420
And in our morgue.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.660
Your beliefs are misguided
and very wrong.

29:55.928 --> 29:57.964
Dr. Andrews and Dr. Lim confirmed

29:58.097 --> 30:01.500
that your insubordination
is just cause for termination.

30:03.169 --> 30:04.236
I'm sorry you feel that way.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.305
But I understand.

30:06.438 --> 30:07.907
I'll clean out my locker.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.942
You don't have to do that.

30:12.111 --> 30:15.514
My job is to mentor
and teach you
how to be a good doctor.

30:17.749 --> 30:20.953
So I want you to watch
the xenotransplant
from the OR gallery.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.957
Just because
you think it's immoral

30:25.091 --> 30:26.859
doesn't mean you shouldn't
learn how it's done.

30:29.795 --> 30:31.130
Are you willing to do that?

30:32.764 --> 30:33.765
Yeah. Yes.

30:36.402 --> 30:37.169
Good.

30:42.975 --> 30:43.775
You can go now.

30:52.318 --> 30:53.652
There's a lot of blood
from the tumor surface.

30:53.785 --> 30:54.987
I need gauze.

31:00.626 --> 31:01.894
It's not stopping.

31:02.028 --> 31:03.629
You need to cut off
the tumor blood supply.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.965
Thank you, Dr. Reznick.

31:08.167 --> 31:12.304
Actually, I think the bleeding
might be coming from
the superior laryngeal artery.

31:15.942 --> 31:18.310
Adding additional
clamp and a silk tie.

31:22.314 --> 31:23.382
The bleeding stopped.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.652
Good catch.

31:26.785 --> 31:27.920
Thanks.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.488
Looks like you're
more than just a pretty face.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.692
My grandma, who I loved
and cherished, would agree.

31:47.706 --> 31:49.708
There's a minor tear in
the inferior epigastric artery.

31:51.610 --> 31:52.344
No, I've got this.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.814
I need to get more light
and a ten blade.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.352
I'll open over the entry site.

32:03.589 --> 32:04.590
Thank you.

32:06.392 --> 32:08.360
Come on. Where are you?

32:09.828 --> 32:10.596
There it is.

32:11.463 --> 32:12.364
Bipolar forceps.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.972
And... we're back on track.

32:22.641 --> 32:23.542
Nice work.

32:51.637 --> 32:53.072
It's kind of a big deal.
Maybe you want
to say something?

32:53.905 --> 32:54.806
Mm. Why?

32:57.243 --> 32:58.110
Never mind.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.280
You're our hero, Wilbur.

33:02.614 --> 33:03.415
Ten blade.

33:15.727 --> 33:16.495
Sternal saw.

33:29.741 --> 33:31.443
Oh.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.445
This is harder
than I thought it would be.

33:35.847 --> 33:38.950
- You want me to do it?
- No. I am the attending.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.453
I will do it.

33:48.694 --> 33:49.461
Okay.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.073
Stop!

34:01.207 --> 34:03.109
Motorcyclist just declared
brain dead in the ER.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.444
He's a match,
and his family consented.
Heart's on the way.

34:05.577 --> 34:07.679
Oh.

34:12.017 --> 34:15.321
Oh.
That felt inappropriate.

34:16.122 --> 34:17.823
It was.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.802
Your surgery
was very successful,

34:31.837 --> 34:34.072
and, thankfully,
not innovative at all.

34:36.041 --> 34:37.075
You're gonna be fine.

34:38.210 --> 34:39.178
Thanks to Dr. Murphy.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.517
It was a team effort.

34:47.553 --> 34:49.221
Except for Dr. Powell.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.094
Ah.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.731
I thought
I was supposed to rest.

34:59.865 --> 35:01.967
Movement post-surgery helps
the blood flow and recovery.

35:15.747 --> 35:16.848
What's a pig doing in here?

35:17.816 --> 35:19.251
His name's Wilbur.

35:19.385 --> 35:20.519
He was gonna donate his heart,

35:20.652 --> 35:21.753
but turns out
they didn't need him.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.758
Want to meet him?
He's super nice.

35:30.396 --> 35:31.797
Pigs are actually
one of the smartest animals.

35:32.798 --> 35:34.733
I grew up on a farm.

35:34.866 --> 35:37.536
We once had a pig
who could do long division.

35:37.669 --> 35:38.637
Mm.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.141
What's gonna happen to him now?

35:45.244 --> 35:46.144
He'll have to be euthanized.

35:47.279 --> 35:48.780
He's been genetically modified.

35:48.914 --> 35:50.081
Can't be around other pigs.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.454
Use you once

35:56.655 --> 35:57.756
and throw you away.

36:19.911 --> 36:22.147
You are brilliant.

36:22.281 --> 36:23.615
- It worked?
- Perfectly.

36:24.483 --> 36:26.151
Wilbur's got a new parent,

36:26.285 --> 36:28.320
and Jeremiah's got a reason
to step outside
at least twice a day.

36:28.454 --> 36:29.321
Mm.

36:31.122 --> 36:33.492
I'm impressed. Seriously.

36:33.625 --> 36:35.727
You should be.
Because I'm awesome.

36:37.463 --> 36:40.098
Jeremiah
just needed a little push
in the right direction.

36:43.402 --> 36:46.272
I'm glad you didn't just make
a snap judgment
based on his appearance.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.445
I thought I knew your type.

36:54.980 --> 36:55.647
I'm sorry.

36:56.548 --> 36:57.816
Mm.

36:57.949 --> 37:00.986
Wanna grab a drink,
let me make it up to you?

37:02.688 --> 37:03.489
We're good.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.492
And I'm beat.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.828
Gonna go home,
do some restorative yoga,

37:10.596 --> 37:11.863
and, uh, hit the hay.

37:11.997 --> 37:12.664
Yeah, me too.

37:13.665 --> 37:14.733
No, I'm kidding.

37:16.101 --> 37:16.968
I'm gonna drink.

37:18.504 --> 37:19.805
But mad respect.

37:19.938 --> 37:20.972
<i>Namaste.</i>

37:28.580 --> 37:30.081
So, he wasn't your type,
but now he is?

37:31.082 --> 37:32.418
- I never said that.
- Ooh.

37:32.551 --> 37:33.785
You absolutely said it.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.086
You just used
your flirty voice.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.523
You were like,
"Mad respect. Namaste."

37:39.925 --> 37:43.261
Can we continue this argument
over Negronis?

37:44.330 --> 37:45.764
I paid last time.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.065
<i>I</i> paid last time.

37:47.198 --> 37:49.435
- No, I paid last time.
- Oh, really?

37:49.568 --> 37:51.703
Yeah, 'cause I had to leave
the tip, too.

37:51.837 --> 37:52.704
Kick.

37:53.639 --> 37:54.540
Toes up.

37:55.240 --> 37:56.007
Good.

37:57.075 --> 37:57.909
Down.

38:00.045 --> 38:00.712
How was the appy?

38:01.713 --> 38:02.714
Fine.

38:03.549 --> 38:04.550
Fine, but what?

38:06.585 --> 38:08.086
I'll, uh, get you set up
with the E-stim.

38:14.426 --> 38:17.729
I feel like a racehorse
that's been relegated
to the carousel.

38:22.868 --> 38:25.904
I used to tell people
that it took me two years

38:27.272 --> 38:29.441
to get back to being
the surgeon that I was,

38:29.575 --> 38:31.743
you know, before
the brain cancer and all that.

38:33.144 --> 38:33.979
I lied.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.583
I never got back to being
the surgeon I was.

38:39.785 --> 38:41.953
You're never going to be
the doctor you were.

38:42.087 --> 38:44.089
That's a fact.

38:44.222 --> 38:46.558
But you have no idea
the doctor you're gonna become.

38:49.861 --> 38:51.162
And I am here for you.

38:52.364 --> 38:53.432
Anytime.

38:56.602 --> 38:57.669
Thanks.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.755
I've been told
you two have been
sniping at each other.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.624
- No, we--
- This is not a conversation.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.193
You two need to
sort your stuff out,

39:22.327 --> 39:23.795
because I don't ever want
to have to deal with it again.

39:24.896 --> 39:25.997
- Yes.
- It won't happen again.

39:26.932 --> 39:27.833
Good.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.009
So, how was your first day?

39:40.946 --> 39:42.213
<i>Tequila stat!</i>

39:42.347 --> 39:44.315
Are we commiserating
or celebrating?

39:44.450 --> 39:46.685
We are definitely celebrating.

40:17.949 --> 40:18.850
Ugh.

40:20.552 --> 40:21.653
Come on!

40:22.488 --> 40:25.356
- Hey. Tough day?
- Oh.

40:26.992 --> 40:28.059
I know you said
you don't want any--

40:28.193 --> 40:29.761
No, I-- I'm-- I can do this.
Thank you.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.366
Ah!

40:40.105 --> 40:40.872
Come on!

40:54.986 --> 40:55.854
You okay?

40:55.987 --> 40:58.524
No, I am not okay.

41:01.192 --> 41:03.461
I'm so sick of this chair.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.497
I'm sick of having to drive
with my hands.

41:05.631 --> 41:07.833
I'm sick of not being able
to get around

41:07.966 --> 41:10.569
because there are stairs <i>everywhere.</i>

41:11.870 --> 41:15.240
And I hate that my body
won't do what I want.

41:15.373 --> 41:17.843
I hate having to train
like an Olympic gymnast

41:17.976 --> 41:20.211
just so I can get off
the damn toilet.

41:20.345 --> 41:21.813
And I hate Shaun Murphy.

41:26.785 --> 41:27.919
This is all his fault.
