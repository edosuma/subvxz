1:03:06.182 --> 1:03:09.586
- Yes, it's--
it doesn't go anywhere.

1:03:09.653 --> 1:03:10.820
Do you want to know
something ridiculous?

1:03:10.887 --> 1:03:12.689
- What?
- I was gonna come in tonight,

1:03:12.756 --> 1:03:13.990
like, I was gonna, like,
have you--be able

1:03:14.057 --> 1:03:15.558
to cut my hair?
- No, I'm so good at it.

1:03:15.625 --> 1:03:16.860
You should have.

1:03:18.094 --> 1:03:19.162
You look terrible.

1:03:19.229 --> 1:03:21.831
[both laughing]

1:03:23.066 --> 1:03:24.634
- These guys tonight,

1:03:24.701 --> 1:03:26.603
they were kissing us,

1:03:26.670 --> 1:03:30.307
they were planning out fun
games and dates and activities.

1:03:30.373 --> 1:03:31.841
I was laughing all night.

1:03:31.908 --> 1:03:32.942
- Uh-huh.

1:03:34.811 --> 1:03:36.279
That's considered out,
but we made it.

1:03:36.346 --> 1:03:38.481
[laughing]
Good job.

1:03:40.216 --> 1:03:42.852
- I finally feel like
the Bachelorette tonight.

1:03:42.919 --> 1:03:44.921
- To tonight,
first Rose Ceremony,

1:03:44.988 --> 1:03:46.690
first actual Rose Ceremony.
- First real Rose Ceremony.

1:03:46.756 --> 1:03:48.425
- First real Rose Ceremony.

1:03:48.491 --> 1:03:51.094
- I think we
should talk about

1:03:51.161 --> 1:03:53.697
what happened
in the house with Chris.

1:03:53.763 --> 1:03:54.998
Um...
- Right.

1:03:55.065 --> 1:03:57.600
- Do you feel like,
you know, one of us should

1:03:57.667 --> 1:03:59.602
kind of bring it
to their attention?

1:03:59.669 --> 1:04:01.104
- I mean, if we could bring her
over here and sit her down,

1:04:01.171 --> 1:04:03.406
I 100% speak on basically

1:04:03.473 --> 1:04:04.474
what we talked about
that night.

1:04:04.541 --> 1:04:05.542
- I just--
I think it's important

1:04:05.608 --> 1:04:06.710
for them to know his character.

1:04:06.776 --> 1:04:08.345
They need to know
the type of guys

1:04:08.411 --> 1:04:10.413
who are in this house,
and they're making decisions

1:04:10.480 --> 1:04:11.748
based off that.
- Yeah.

1:04:11.815 --> 1:04:13.316
- What he said was,
if you made it

1:04:13.383 --> 1:04:15.085
to Fantasy Suites,
and if you were

1:04:15.151 --> 1:04:16.986
the third one to go--
- He would leave them.

1:04:17.053 --> 1:04:18.188
- Well, I feel like
because of what

1:04:18.254 --> 1:04:20.223
they went through,
I feel like I, you know--

1:04:20.290 --> 1:04:21.858
- Well, they're
even more sensitive.

1:04:21.925 --> 1:04:23.326
- On the situation. Yeah.
- Exactly. Right.

1:04:23.393 --> 1:04:25.395
- They just went to the same
situation that he addressed.

1:04:25.462 --> 1:04:26.830
- Yeah.

1:04:26.896 --> 1:04:29.065
- Oh, yeah, they're gonna
want to know, of course.

1:04:29.132 --> 1:04:31.501
If someone says
something about me

1:04:31.568 --> 1:04:34.471
and then you didn't tell me,
I will actually be

1:04:34.537 --> 1:04:37.907
more offended that
you didn't tell me.

1:04:37.974 --> 1:04:39.342
- Hello, how are you doing?

1:04:39.409 --> 1:04:41.144
It's nice to finally
get to talk to you.

1:04:41.211 --> 1:04:43.413
- I know.
- Oh, you're walking? Awesome.

1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:45.382
I love the suit.

1:04:45.448 --> 1:04:47.650
- I have to address, you know,
what's happening in the house.

1:04:47.717 --> 1:04:49.185
- What do you mean?

1:04:49.252 --> 1:04:53.356
- I think whoever overheard
the conversation and doesn't

1:04:53.423 --> 1:04:56.126
bring it to their attention
is basically

1:04:56.192 --> 1:04:59.129
keeping secrets
from their wife.

1:04:59.195 --> 1:05:00.797
- What's going on?

1:05:00.864 --> 1:05:05.535
- Honestly, we just wanted
to talk about Chris.

1:05:05.602 --> 1:05:07.904
I wouldn't want you
to not know something,

1:05:07.971 --> 1:05:09.706
so I want it
to be very truthful

1:05:09.773 --> 1:05:11.107
and allow you
to give you a situation.

1:05:11.174 --> 1:05:12.108
- Okay.

1:05:12.175 --> 1:05:13.676
- So Chris

1:05:13.743 --> 1:05:15.678
was talking to a few guys
this week

1:05:15.745 --> 1:05:19.516
about Fantasy Suites,
and his whole talk was,

1:05:19.582 --> 1:05:21.785
"If I made it
to Fantasy Suites,

1:05:21.851 --> 1:05:23.453
"and if they had
slept with anyone,

1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:24.888
I would walk out and leave."

1:05:24.954 --> 1:05:26.156
- Okay.

1:05:26.222 --> 1:05:27.991
- So I asked
a simple question:

1:05:28.057 --> 1:05:29.959
"Would you bring
this up before?"

1:05:30.026 --> 1:05:31.628
And he couldn't
answer the question.

1:05:31.694 --> 1:05:33.396
- So people are talking
about Fantasy Suites?

1:05:33.463 --> 1:05:35.031
- No, not everybody.

1:05:35.098 --> 1:05:36.766
- Who was talking about it?
- It came up.

1:05:36.833 --> 1:05:38.101
Chris brought it up
in a conversation.

1:05:38.168 --> 1:05:39.602
- So he's bringing it up.
- Yes. Yeah.

1:05:39.669 --> 1:05:41.471
- I don't even know why sex
is being brought up.

1:05:41.538 --> 1:05:42.739
- Yeah.

1:05:42.806 --> 1:05:44.607
- I can't believe
this is happening.

1:05:44.674 --> 1:05:46.609
When I came into this,
I didn't want to look like

1:05:46.676 --> 1:05:49.245
a girl that just got brought
to Fantasy Suites

1:05:49.312 --> 1:05:52.649
and, you know,
almost sexualized in a way.

1:05:52.715 --> 1:05:55.919
To hear that being brought up
before I have a conversation

1:05:55.985 --> 1:05:58.488
with someone is truly
almost my biggest fear.

1:05:58.555 --> 1:06:00.089
Okay, I just do want
to thank you guys.

1:06:00.156 --> 1:06:02.525
I'm gonna step away,
and I'm gonna talk to Gabby.

1:06:04.093 --> 1:06:08.298
The fact that Chris is already
discussing ultimatums

1:06:08.364 --> 1:06:10.934
to try to take control
of our journey,

1:06:10.967 --> 1:06:13.102
it just is
extremely upsetting,

1:06:13.169 --> 1:06:16.039
and it's not how I wanted
this night to go.

1:06:16.105 --> 1:06:18.541
Hi, sorry, Justin.
- Oh, hi.

1:06:18.608 --> 1:06:20.009
- Gabby, can I talk to you
for a minute?

1:06:20.076 --> 1:06:21.311
- Yeah, oh, my gosh, yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1:06:21.377 --> 1:06:22.712
- Okay.
- Yeah, please.

1:06:22.779 --> 1:06:24.647
- Sorry about that.
- No, please, by all means.

1:06:24.714 --> 1:06:26.382
- Yeah, we'll go outside.
- Okay.

1:06:26.449 --> 1:06:28.818
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God what?

1:06:28.885 --> 1:06:30.186
- Yeah
- Tell me.

1:06:35.859 --> 1:06:39.496
- I just got brought
some information from Quincey,

1:06:39.562 --> 1:06:42.332
Jordan, and Hayden.
- Yeah.

1:06:42.398 --> 1:06:44.901
- They brought me over,
and they told me that

1:06:44.968 --> 1:06:48.838
Chris is, like, talking about
Fantasy Suites already.

1:06:48.905 --> 1:06:50.874
- Ew, what is he saying
about it?

1:06:50.940 --> 1:06:53.376
- He was basically saying
that if he was ever

1:06:53.443 --> 1:06:56.579
in a position where he
was brought to Fantasy Suites

1:06:56.646 --> 1:06:57.981
and we slept with someone else,

1:06:58.047 --> 1:07:01.384
that he would leave,
but he wouldn't tell us.

1:07:02.919 --> 1:07:04.521
- What?
- Yeah.

1:07:04.587 --> 1:07:05.955
- I'm pretty shocked.

1:07:06.022 --> 1:07:07.957
I haven't even had
one conversation with Chris,

1:07:08.024 --> 1:07:10.159
so for him to already be
talking about Fantasy Suites

1:07:10.226 --> 1:07:13.596
is--actually, it's, like,
entirely ridiculous.

1:07:13.663 --> 1:07:18.167
- I think we do owe him
the opportunity to speak to us

1:07:18.234 --> 1:07:19.702
if you're okay
with hearing him out.

1:07:19.769 --> 1:07:20.970
- Yeah.

1:07:21.037 --> 1:07:23.172
It seems very controlling,

1:07:23.239 --> 1:07:26.709
and I think it's disrespectful
of our journey and our process.

1:07:26.776 --> 1:07:28.611
- I feel bad that we had
to address it because I saw

1:07:28.678 --> 1:07:30.113
a look on her face
and she was just, like--

1:07:30.179 --> 1:07:32.015
- She was like, what the hell?
- She was [bleep] disgusted.

1:07:32.081 --> 1:07:34.384
- 100%, she felt
extremely disrespected.

1:07:34.450 --> 1:07:36.319
- Oh, yo, bro, leave them.
Bro, leave them.

1:07:36.386 --> 1:07:37.921
[tense music]

1:07:37.987 --> 1:07:39.656
- Oh, good. Thank God.

1:07:39.722 --> 1:07:41.157
- Hi.

1:07:41.224 --> 1:07:42.625
Chris, can we speak with you?

1:07:42.692 --> 1:07:43.693
- Yeah, I'd like to.

1:07:43.760 --> 1:07:45.194
- If you'd like
to come with us.

1:07:45.261 --> 1:07:46.362
- Yeah.

1:07:46.429 --> 1:07:48.031
- This is about
to [bleep] everything up.

1:07:48.097 --> 1:07:49.165
- Yeah.
- No joke.

1:07:50.400 --> 1:07:51.734
- Nice to finally
meet you.

1:07:51.801 --> 1:07:53.503
- So do you feel like
it's appropriate to be talking

1:07:53.570 --> 1:07:55.204
about Fantasy Suites
this early?

1:07:55.271 --> 1:07:58.207
♪ ♪

1:07:58.274 --> 1:08:01.544
- Yeah, so I sat down
with the guys the other day,

1:08:01.611 --> 1:08:04.981
and Fantasy Suites
was a conversation at the time.

1:08:05.048 --> 1:08:06.983
You guys maybe had
some questions about it?

1:08:07.050 --> 1:08:08.051
- I don't think
we have questions.

1:08:08.117 --> 1:08:09.419
We'd like to hear from you.

1:08:09.485 --> 1:08:12.522
- Yeah, I think
it's an appropriate thought

1:08:12.589 --> 1:08:13.723
because the reality is,

1:08:13.790 --> 1:08:15.525
if I were gonna be able
to find love,

1:08:15.592 --> 1:08:17.827
I tend to think all the way
through till the end

1:08:17.894 --> 1:08:19.729
and then be able to work it
backwards from there.

1:08:19.796 --> 1:08:21.230
So that would be my response.

1:08:21.297 --> 1:08:23.766
- Okay, but I guess
the problem I have is,

1:08:23.833 --> 1:08:27.236
they were saying that
if you were in a situation

1:08:27.303 --> 1:08:28.705
where you were
in a Fantasy Suite,

1:08:28.771 --> 1:08:31.541
that if Gabby or I decided
to be intimate

1:08:31.608 --> 1:08:34.677
with someone else,
that you would just leave

1:08:34.744 --> 1:08:36.312
and you wouldn't ever tell us

1:08:36.379 --> 1:08:38.448
that that was
an ultimatum for you.

1:08:38.514 --> 1:08:40.216
And I think--
- That's not--I always want in

1:08:40.283 --> 1:08:43.052
relationships, the opportunity
for me to be able to speak

1:08:43.119 --> 1:08:45.622
for myself first
rather than for somebody else

1:08:45.688 --> 1:08:46.990
to tell you what my words are.

1:08:47.056 --> 1:08:49.859
Like, my exact
verbatim wording was,

1:08:49.926 --> 1:08:52.362
"I wouldn't want to be
in a situation

1:08:52.428 --> 1:08:54.731
"where that person
who I was interested in

1:08:54.797 --> 1:08:57.000
"had a sexual relationship
with somebody else,

1:08:57.066 --> 1:08:57.967
"and then myself.

1:08:58.034 --> 1:08:59.035
"At that situation,

1:08:59.102 --> 1:09:00.770
"I wouldn't be
interested anymore

1:09:00.837 --> 1:09:02.138
in continuing
the relationships."

1:09:02.205 --> 1:09:05.041
I'm not taking away
anybody else's decision.

1:09:05.108 --> 1:09:07.043
And that's something
that I would never want to do

1:09:07.110 --> 1:09:08.745
to a female is take away
their decision.

1:09:08.811 --> 1:09:10.980
- I understand that you're
thinking way far in advance,

1:09:11.047 --> 1:09:13.383
but big picture,
this is four days in,

1:09:13.449 --> 1:09:16.919
and your very calculated
thoughts

1:09:16.986 --> 1:09:19.022
about Fantasy Suites

1:09:19.088 --> 1:09:22.892
are pretty inappropriate
at this time.

1:09:22.959 --> 1:09:24.293
- I wasn't the only person
to speak about it,

1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:25.695
but ultimately,
the conversation is about me.

1:09:25.762 --> 1:09:26.796
- You were willing to talk
about it at depth,

1:09:26.863 --> 1:09:28.965
which, if you've
seen our journey...

1:09:29.032 --> 1:09:29.999
- Yeah.
- You would know

1:09:30.066 --> 1:09:31.801
it'd be important to us.

1:09:31.868 --> 1:09:35.071
And would respect our place
as women...

1:09:35.138 --> 1:09:36.539
- Yes.
- In our position

1:09:36.606 --> 1:09:39.809
to make our own decisions,
which it seems like if we went

1:09:39.876 --> 1:09:42.011
against something
you believed in,

1:09:42.078 --> 1:09:44.247
you would take that time
to leave.

1:09:44.313 --> 1:09:47.050
- I feel like I'd like
the opportunity to meet you all

1:09:47.116 --> 1:09:48.451
individually
and speak with you,

1:09:48.518 --> 1:09:49.919
but you all don't want
that opportunity with me--

1:09:49.986 --> 1:09:51.054
- I'm gonna stop you
right there.

1:09:51.120 --> 1:09:53.256
I really do feel like
right now,

1:09:53.322 --> 1:09:54.590
you could take the opportunity

1:09:54.657 --> 1:09:56.993
to maybe apologize
and own up to what happened.

1:09:57.060 --> 1:09:58.561
But instead,
I still feel as if you're

1:09:58.628 --> 1:10:01.030
being condescending towards us.

1:10:01.097 --> 1:10:02.999
I feel like you're dancing
around the issue.

1:10:03.066 --> 1:10:04.967
- I thought that I did tell you
exactly what happened.

1:10:05.001 --> 1:10:07.336
- We can help make
this decision at this point.

1:10:07.403 --> 1:10:09.706
I don't want anyone to be
thinking about Fantasy Suites.

1:10:09.772 --> 1:10:11.007
It's so early.

1:10:11.074 --> 1:10:12.608
We don't even know
if we have a connection.

1:10:12.675 --> 1:10:14.744
- Right.
- And it sounds like you have

1:10:14.811 --> 1:10:16.412
pretty sure thoughts on it.

1:10:16.479 --> 1:10:18.748
So to not even put you
in that place,

1:10:18.815 --> 1:10:21.084
I do think it would be time
for you to go.

1:10:21.150 --> 1:10:22.351
- Okay.

1:10:22.418 --> 1:10:24.454
- I'm gonna agree with her.

1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:25.788
