00:00.922 --> 00:04.109
<i>The 1970s were
an awesome time to be a kid.</i>

00:04.195 --> 00:06.062
<i>It was the Wild West.</i>

00:06.133 --> 00:08.546
<i>Bike helmets hadn't been
invented yet or car seatbelts</i>

00:08.601 --> 00:10.753
<i>or even normal adult supervision.</i>

00:10.871 --> 00:13.053
<i>Dads weren't around
as much as they are now.</i>

00:13.116 --> 00:15.116
<i>And my mom was busy running the house.</i>

00:15.218 --> 00:18.353
<i>She had a lot on her plate
and no time for tomfoolery...</i>

00:18.455 --> 00:19.487
<i>whatever that is.</i>

00:19.589 --> 00:20.889
<i>There were eight of us boys,</i>

00:20.991 --> 00:23.625
<i>including my oldest brother,
just home from college.</i>

00:23.727 --> 00:26.361
<i>That's a lot of testosterone
under one roof.</i>

00:30.000 --> 00:32.200
Allow me, m'lady.

00:32.302 --> 00:33.668
Don't forget your lunch.
I made you a sandwich

00:33.770 --> 00:34.903
from the left-over meatloaf.

00:35.005 --> 00:37.339
Oh, I like that, Peg.

00:37.407 --> 00:40.008
Your loaf only gets better with time.

00:40.110 --> 00:41.109
Ew.

00:41.211 --> 00:42.777
Buck-89 from the Sears toy department

00:42.879 --> 00:44.279
literally down the drain.

00:44.381 --> 00:45.880
Hey, Pat, I found your Army doll!

00:45.982 --> 00:47.282
I'm busy!

00:47.351 --> 00:50.618
Oh, well, thank God
your father and I aren't.

00:53.857 --> 00:55.256
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:55.359 --> 00:56.791
Hey, be careful.

00:56.893 --> 00:59.094
One of those belts might knock
a picture off the wall.

00:59.196 --> 01:00.228
Alright, you got this.

01:00.330 --> 01:01.463
I'll be home the usual.

01:01.565 --> 01:02.530
Honestly.

01:02.632 --> 01:04.165
Geez.

01:05.869 --> 01:07.068
Hey, Mrs. Cleary.

01:07.170 --> 01:08.503
Oh, hi, Wendi.

01:08.605 --> 01:10.238
Thanks for letting me borrow this.

01:10.340 --> 01:12.440
Of course. When do I wear a scarf?

01:12.542 --> 01:14.542
I'm not driving a convertible
around Monaco.

01:14.611 --> 01:16.578
I guess it's hard for you
to get out and have fun.

01:16.680 --> 01:17.612
Oh, I don't know. Just yesterday

01:17.714 --> 01:19.681
I went to Bunny Delmonte's funeral.

01:19.783 --> 01:20.982
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:21.084 --> 01:22.417
Don't be. They had those Jewish donuts

01:22.519 --> 01:24.552
you spread cheese on.

01:24.654 --> 01:26.988
Do you ever just go get coffee
with a friend?

01:27.090 --> 01:28.690
Coffee makes me jittery.

01:28.792 --> 01:30.191
And so do friends.

01:30.293 --> 01:31.459
Eddie's in his room.

01:31.561 --> 01:32.694
But be warned.

01:32.763 --> 01:34.329
It smells like seat-noises in there.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.068
Mommy, I think "seat-noises"
is just <i> our</i> family's word.

01:40.170 --> 01:43.438
Five seconds in Eddie's room
and she'll be up to speed.

01:47.277 --> 01:49.444
Close the door. Where's my mom?

01:49.546 --> 01:50.779
In the backyard, don't worry.

01:50.847 --> 01:52.213
Close the door anyway.

01:52.315 --> 01:54.015
<i>My mom had a sixth sense
when it came to us</i>

01:54.117 --> 01:55.550
<i>trying to get away with anything.</i>

01:55.652 --> 01:58.887
<i>The distant click
of a closing bedroom door</i>

01:58.989 --> 02:01.256
<i>was like an air-raid siren to her.</i>

02:04.728 --> 02:06.795
Lookie here.

02:06.897 --> 02:08.763
Wow. Champagne.

02:08.865 --> 02:10.298
And it's red.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.168
This is Cold Duck.

02:13.270 --> 02:15.603
It's from a vineyard in De-twah.

02:15.705 --> 02:17.038
I think that's pronounced "Detroit."

02:17.140 --> 02:18.173
Oh, same as ours.

02:18.275 --> 02:19.808
My buddy, Dino, swiped this
from his folks.

02:19.910 --> 02:21.810
This will be fun when we see
the meteor shower tonight.

02:21.912 --> 02:23.912
It will definitely enhance
the Perseids Maximus,

02:24.014 --> 02:25.280
which is very active this year.

02:25.382 --> 02:26.815
"Perseids Maximus"?

02:26.917 --> 02:28.216
I researched that at the library

02:28.285 --> 02:30.285
so you wouldn't think I was just
taking you there to make out.

02:30.387 --> 02:32.587
Mm, which you are.
You better stow that, though.

02:32.689 --> 02:34.589
Your mom has a way of popping in
unexpectedly.

02:34.691 --> 02:37.125
If we like this,
I can get other stuff from Dino.

02:37.194 --> 02:39.861
He's a good guy
and he doesn't mind stealing.

02:42.399 --> 02:43.465
Holy hell!

02:43.567 --> 02:44.833
I'm dead!

02:46.303 --> 02:48.436
If my mom finds out, I'm dead!

02:48.538 --> 02:50.038
Then we can't let her find out.

02:50.140 --> 02:51.306
<i>Sure, Mom could have burst in</i>

02:51.408 --> 02:52.624
<i>and brought down the hammer right there,</i>

02:52.741 --> 02:55.043
<i>but my mother saw
the opportunity to figure out</i>

02:55.145 --> 02:56.544
<i>if Wendi was worthy of Eddie...</i>

02:56.646 --> 02:59.542
<i>and, more importantly, worthy of her.</i>

03:00.150 --> 03:02.150
I have $9 and a
Pee Wee Reese rookie card

03:02.252 --> 03:03.651
in my top sock drawer.

03:03.753 --> 03:05.987
Take them and go.
You can start a new life.

03:12.953 --> 03:14.786
We... We can clean this.
This isn't so bad.

03:14.859 --> 03:16.486
It <i> is</i> bad. My parents hate liquor.

03:16.555 --> 03:17.775
They won't even have it in the house.

03:17.891 --> 03:18.890
<i>This was true.</i>

03:18.959 --> 03:20.124
<i>If a recipe called for alcohol,</i>

03:20.193 --> 03:22.126
<i>my mom would substitute something else.</i>

03:22.195 --> 03:23.761
<i>Her Cream of Mushroom Rum Cake</i>

03:23.863 --> 03:25.330
<i>was not a hit at bake sales.</i>

03:25.398 --> 03:27.162
Maybe I can distract your mom
for a little while.

03:27.233 --> 03:28.239
It won't work.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.707
I have to clean the sheets, the floor!

03:29.809 --> 03:31.009
I just have to get her out of the house

03:31.077 --> 03:32.810
- for a few hours.
- She doesn't leave this house.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.145
She goes to church and that's it.

03:34.247 --> 03:35.146
What does she do for fun?

03:35.215 --> 03:36.948
Nothing. She's the enemy of fun.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.349
Your mom trusts me.

03:38.418 --> 03:39.484
I'll convince her.

03:39.586 --> 03:41.419
I can't have her hating me over this.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.955
She won't hate you.
She'll just judge you forever.

03:44.057 --> 03:47.258
Oh, wait, that's what she does for fun.

03:49.262 --> 03:50.228
Mom?!

03:50.297 --> 03:51.663
Wasting electricity in the daytime?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.064
Use the free light.

03:56.536 --> 03:57.635
Hey, Mrs. Cleary.

03:57.737 --> 03:59.837
Oh.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.339
You and Eddie headed out?

04:01.408 --> 04:03.708
We were, but then I started thinking...

04:03.810 --> 04:05.243
<i>you</i> should go out.

04:05.345 --> 04:07.378
What a strange suggestion.

04:07.447 --> 04:09.480
Why on earth would you want me
to leave the house?

04:10.550 --> 04:12.183
Oh, wait, I know!

04:12.285 --> 04:14.552
You're worried about me
having enough fun.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.286
You were saying
that you don't get out much.

04:16.389 --> 04:17.889
Well, I guess I wouldn't mind
having my hair done

04:17.991 --> 04:18.923
at Helen's Salon.

04:19.024 --> 04:20.190
But I could never...

04:20.293 --> 04:21.426
Of course you could!

04:21.528 --> 04:22.660
No, every time I turn around,

04:22.729 --> 04:24.629
there's some new mess being created.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.532
Who knows what else I'd find
if I started poking around.

04:28.468 --> 04:30.868
There's a house
full of healthy boys here

04:30.970 --> 04:33.004
to take care of all that. Eddie!

04:33.073 --> 04:34.706
These useless lumps are no help.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.574
She's not wrong. We're lumps.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.309
They're just pretending to be useless

04:38.411 --> 04:39.610
so you don't make them do chores.

04:39.713 --> 04:40.545
Did you tell her?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.680
No, but you just did.

04:42.716 --> 04:43.915
Sorry, Mrs. Cleary.

04:44.017 --> 04:45.983
I'm not taking no for an answer.

04:46.052 --> 04:47.085
Heeey!

04:47.153 --> 04:48.486
You changed your shirt.

04:48.588 --> 04:52.990
Funny, I just had the craziest sneeze.

04:53.059 --> 04:54.926
Your mother's going to go out
and get her hair done.

04:55.028 --> 04:55.860
Oh, good idea!

04:55.929 --> 04:57.695
And I said while she's out,

04:57.764 --> 04:59.063
we'll take care of her housework.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.466
We're doing something nice
for Mom? I'm in.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.835
You see, they're dying to help...

05:03.937 --> 05:06.875
watch the baby, do the laundry,
mop the kitchen.

05:06.953 --> 05:07.974
It's the least they can do.

05:08.071 --> 05:12.143
- I can picture less.
- You're all being so sweet.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.011
Oh. What the heck.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.813
Okay. I'll go.

05:15.882 --> 05:18.182
But I promise, I'll be right back.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.417
Take your time.

05:19.486 --> 05:20.451
Do extra stuff.

05:20.553 --> 05:22.687
Get your fingernails washed or whatever.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.188
Fingernail washing?

05:24.257 --> 05:26.424
That's no fun alone.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.860
Oh, wait. Here's a thought...

05:28.928 --> 05:30.428
Wendi, why don't you come with me?

05:30.497 --> 05:34.098
Um... I-I suppose that could work.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.867
It'll be my treat! We'll gossip,

05:35.969 --> 05:37.168
tell each other all our secrets.

05:37.270 --> 05:38.636
Uh...

05:38.738 --> 05:40.004
I'm kidding!

05:40.073 --> 05:42.306
You don't have any secrets from me.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.245
If you guys really want
to help me clean the house

05:47.313 --> 05:49.313
the best way to do that
is to stay out of my way.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.215
I'll let you back in for dinner.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.686
If you need me, I'll be under that tree.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.922
Or more correctly, I'll be visiting

05:57.991 --> 06:00.558
the seventh moon of Vallys
with my good friend Quaytar.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.226
Alone under the tree, got it.

06:02.295 --> 06:03.795
What about you, Pat?

06:03.863 --> 06:05.096
Want to meet my secret dog?

06:05.165 --> 06:06.330
The one with the blood-red eyes

06:06.399 --> 06:08.032
who stares through
your bedroom window at night?

06:08.134 --> 06:09.534
No, that's Kevin.

06:09.636 --> 06:10.835
This one's real.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.170
I keep him a couple blocks from here.

06:12.272 --> 06:13.738
C'mon.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.910
Our main job today
is keeping <i> that</i> alive.

06:19.012 --> 06:19.977
Don't die.

06:20.079 --> 06:21.546
Joey, go to the garage.

06:21.614 --> 06:23.514
You're gonna grab a bucket
and mop, come back,

06:23.583 --> 06:25.783
and your job will be scrubbing
the kitchen floors.

06:25.885 --> 06:26.784
On it!

06:26.853 --> 06:28.653
Frank, you do laundry.

06:28.721 --> 06:30.421
As long as you tell Mom it was me.

06:30.523 --> 06:32.657
Unlike Mother's Day,
when <i> I</i> bought her a card

06:32.692 --> 06:34.725
and everybody put their names on it.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.327
Don't be a drip, Frank.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.296
Even Joey is helping.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.998
Start with the wet towels
in the bathroom.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.067
Hey, what's goin' on?

06:43.169 --> 06:43.968
Glad you're here.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.169
There's kind of a crisis.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.504
Oh, yeah, Dad forgot his lunch.

06:46.606 --> 06:49.841
What?! No! If Dad comes home
hungry, I'm dead!

06:49.876 --> 06:51.108
Sure, the guy can be a little grumpy,

06:51.177 --> 06:52.376
but just steer clear 'til he's eaten.

06:52.479 --> 06:54.779
What in tarnation happened here?!

07:00.854 --> 07:03.187
Now I see the real reason
you sent Mom to the hairdresser.

07:03.289 --> 07:04.622
You don't really care about helping her

07:04.724 --> 07:06.491
be as beautiful as she can be.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.825
This will all be taken care of.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.962
Oh, it will, once I call Mom
and Mom calls the police

07:11.064 --> 07:12.597
and the police thank Mom
and Mom thanks me.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.999
And I say, "Ho, ho, it's fine, Mom,

07:15.101 --> 07:16.334
we can share the credit."

07:17.470 --> 07:19.270
Stop!

07:21.274 --> 07:23.107
- Give me that!
- Ugh!

07:23.176 --> 07:25.243
You just added assault
to your crimes, mister!

07:28.147 --> 07:29.714
Break it up!

07:35.321 --> 07:36.454
You'll be grounded for...

07:36.523 --> 07:38.923
So where's this dog of yours?

07:39.025 --> 07:41.692
He's trapped. We have to rescue him.

07:46.199 --> 07:49.367
He belongs to the people
living at this house.

07:49.435 --> 07:51.469
Now you sound like the people
that live here.

07:51.538 --> 07:52.670
He wants to play with me.

07:52.739 --> 07:53.871
- Watch!
- No.

07:53.940 --> 07:54.839
No, no, no, no!

07:54.908 --> 07:56.541
No, no! No, no, no, no!

07:56.609 --> 07:58.376
He must know a better way to our house!

07:58.478 --> 07:59.777
Tessie!

07:59.846 --> 08:03.147
What's happening doesn't match
what you're saying!

08:04.684 --> 08:06.784
Keep going straight.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.819
I thought Helen's was near your house?

08:08.888 --> 08:10.721
Wendi, don't ask a million questions...

08:10.790 --> 08:12.690
just go with the flow.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.625
You wanted me to have fun, right?

08:15.929 --> 08:17.795
Or maybe we should just go home...

08:17.864 --> 08:21.699
No, a-absolutely,
we'll go wherever you want.

08:21.768 --> 08:22.934
<i>My mom was big on loyalty,</i>

08:23.036 --> 08:24.669
<i>and planned to put Wendi to the test</i>

08:24.771 --> 08:26.938
<i>before letting this upstart
crack our family circle.</i>

08:27.040 --> 08:28.205
<i>Mom didn't have a license</i>

08:28.274 --> 08:30.107
<i>but was completely in the driver's seat.</i>

08:30.176 --> 08:32.076
Get on the Five Freeway.

08:37.383 --> 08:39.150
I couldn't reach Dad.

08:39.251 --> 08:40.518
Maybe he'll buy his lunch today.

08:40.587 --> 08:44.221
When did a ham sandwich
go up to 75 cents?

08:44.324 --> 08:47.258
That's ridiculous.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.125
Lou.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.161
- Yeah?
- I'm running home.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.662
Are you new here?

08:51.764 --> 08:53.130
Dad's not gonna want to pay for lunch

08:53.232 --> 08:55.399
when he has a free sandwich
waiting at home.

08:55.501 --> 08:57.201
He still talks about
what a deal World War II was

08:57.303 --> 08:59.136
because the Army paid for his meals.

08:59.238 --> 09:02.506
I am gonna tell him and Mom everything!

09:02.575 --> 09:05.042
You guys are gonna be
in so much trouble.

09:05.144 --> 09:07.178
William, untie me!

09:07.246 --> 09:08.412
Or I'll smack you.

09:08.481 --> 09:11.082
Well, you are bigger than me,

09:11.150 --> 09:12.817
but Eddie's bigger than you,

09:12.852 --> 09:15.853
so according to the transitive
property of smacking...

09:15.955 --> 09:17.622
sorry, outta luck.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.749
If Dad got off for lunch
five minutes ago,

09:21.803 --> 09:22.727
he's gonna be here any minute.

09:22.795 --> 09:24.829
Oh. What if he doesn't
have to come inside?

09:24.931 --> 09:27.164
His car pulls up, I just run out
and give him his sandwich!

09:27.266 --> 09:28.833
Problem solved.

09:30.000 --> 09:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:38.778 --> 09:40.177
What?

09:43.249 --> 09:45.016
Oh.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.317
This is nice.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.119
Oh, wow, Mrs. Cleary.

09:48.221 --> 09:51.222
- This place is very chichi.
- What?

09:51.290 --> 09:53.457
You're saying these rich people
are better than us?

09:53.559 --> 09:55.226
Trick question... of course they are.

09:55.294 --> 09:56.460
But they don't know that.

09:56.562 --> 09:58.596
Whatever I do, play along.

09:58.698 --> 10:00.097
I don't think we should...

10:00.199 --> 10:01.532
Hi. We're here for haircuts.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.368
We're "appointment only."
And we're solidly booked.

10:04.470 --> 10:06.737
Excuse me.

10:06.839 --> 10:07.972
It's for the best.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.306
I wouldn't know
what to ask for here anyway.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.441
Don't be silly.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.643
We didn't do freeway-driving
to give up now.

10:12.745 --> 10:14.211
Do you have my back?

10:14.313 --> 10:17.715
Okay...

10:17.817 --> 10:20.484
Um, I believe we're down for 2:00,

10:20.586 --> 10:21.786
but we're very early.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.788
I'm Simone and this is Bianca.

10:23.890 --> 10:26.457
I think we can accommodate you now.

10:26.559 --> 10:29.794
Does that work for you, Bianca?

10:29.855 --> 10:31.154
<i>Ciao?</i>

10:34.525 --> 10:35.733
You have any children, Simone?

10:35.796 --> 10:40.312
Mm. As a matter of fact, I have
eight adorable Pekingeses.

10:40.372 --> 10:41.364
Oh.

10:41.435 --> 10:43.189
I think about 'em like my children.

10:43.250 --> 10:44.716
Actually, I sell their children.

10:44.818 --> 10:45.684
I'm a breeder.

10:45.753 --> 10:46.752
I will have to give you my number.

10:46.820 --> 10:48.554
- I love Chinese dogs!
- No.

10:48.656 --> 10:50.622
Eight? That seems like too many.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.357
Oh, I think that every day, Valentín.

10:53.661 --> 10:56.228
Bianca has an interesting hobby...

10:56.330 --> 10:57.696
falconry.

10:57.798 --> 10:59.965
Tell 'em all about Hercules.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.133
I have a falcon.

11:02.503 --> 11:05.961
And his name is Hercules.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.142
You two are the living end.

11:10.203 --> 11:11.669
Don't go anywhere.

11:11.745 --> 11:13.212
Valentín, right back.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.247
Uh, those are the girls upstairs.

11:15.316 --> 11:16.348
What are we doing, Mrs. Cleary?

11:16.450 --> 11:17.482
We are doing very little.

11:17.585 --> 11:19.318
I'm doing all the heavy lifting here.

11:19.386 --> 11:21.720
"I have a falcon. His name is Hercules."

11:21.789 --> 11:23.522
- You're gonna blow this.
- "Blow this"?

11:23.591 --> 11:25.791
What are gonna do
when Simone and Bianca get here?

11:25.859 --> 11:27.159
You think we can't take
a Simone and a Bianca?

11:27.225 --> 11:28.994
They probably weigh 12 pounds
between 'em.

11:29.063 --> 11:30.862
- Champagne?
- Oh, thank you.

11:31.865 --> 11:32.998
That's nice.

11:33.029 --> 11:34.043
Mm.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.467
Hm?

11:35.569 --> 11:37.402
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna tell your mom.

11:37.467 --> 11:38.870
I thought you didn't drink.

11:38.973 --> 11:40.472
Mike abstains...

11:40.574 --> 11:42.474
a lot of sad boozers on his side.

11:42.543 --> 11:45.477
But I've been known to sneak
a sip every now and again.

11:45.546 --> 11:47.813
You know how that is.

11:47.915 --> 11:48.981
Don't you?

11:52.386 --> 11:54.319
You snooze, you lose.

11:54.421 --> 11:55.854
Mm-hmm.

11:57.291 --> 11:58.257
Pat, if he likes you so much,

11:58.359 --> 11:59.424
why is he running away?

11:59.526 --> 12:01.760
He's not running, he's playing!

12:01.862 --> 12:03.528
No. No! Pat, no, stop!

12:03.631 --> 12:04.663
Don't go in there!

12:04.765 --> 12:06.031
There could be a sewer wolf in there

12:06.133 --> 12:08.500
or a crazed hobo
with a thirst for blood!

12:08.569 --> 12:10.369
There isn't!

12:14.541 --> 12:16.241
Where's Tessie?

12:16.343 --> 12:20.612
I don't know. That pipe
was like a mile long.

12:23.651 --> 12:25.788
- Tessie!
- No!

12:26.086 --> 12:27.919
C'mon, William,
you're better than these guys.

12:28.022 --> 12:30.088
Just free me.

12:30.157 --> 12:34.359
Better yet, I'll free your imagination.

12:34.461 --> 12:36.128
Oh, no.

12:36.230 --> 12:38.463
"Quaytar sat on a dune in the middle

12:38.565 --> 12:39.931
of the Logorian desert

12:40.000 --> 12:42.734
reflecting on the struggle
of the Magoryite people.

12:42.836 --> 12:44.403
- Was it in his destiny"...
- I hate you so much.

12:44.471 --> 12:46.605
You're telling me this is
the last of the meatloaf?

12:46.674 --> 12:48.106
Why'd you have to take such a big bite?

12:48.175 --> 12:49.441
'Cause it's the last of the meatloaf.

12:49.543 --> 12:51.510
Spread it out so it reaches
the edge of the bread.

12:51.612 --> 12:53.412
There you go, a meatloaf comb-over.

12:53.480 --> 12:54.713
There's not enough of it!

12:54.782 --> 12:56.248
Well, her meatloaf's
mostly bread crumbs anyway.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.317
We could fill it up with
crackers and... and ketchup.

12:58.385 --> 13:01.053
Joey, watch for Dad
so we know when he gets here.

13:01.155 --> 13:02.554
He's here.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.690
- There, I helped.
- No!

13:04.758 --> 13:07.159
Go outside and stall.
I need another minute.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.396
Hey, Pop. <i>¿Qué pasa?</i>

13:11.498 --> 13:12.631
I forgot my damn lunch.

13:12.733 --> 13:14.666
- And speak English.
- Hold on.

13:14.735 --> 13:16.435
I'm gonna be straight with you, okay?

13:16.503 --> 13:17.803
I was sent out here to stall you

13:17.871 --> 13:19.237
so you don't see some dicey stuff

13:19.306 --> 13:20.906
that's going on inside right now.

13:20.974 --> 13:23.542
The good news is
you're gonna get your sandwich.

13:23.610 --> 13:25.644
- Where's your mother?
- Exactly the type of question

13:25.713 --> 13:27.012
that'll just get you drawn in deeper.

13:27.114 --> 13:28.146
Look.

13:28.215 --> 13:30.248
I know you're a man
with a lot on his plate.

13:30.317 --> 13:32.050
You really want to take this on?

13:34.722 --> 13:36.421
Is anyone hurt or in danger?

13:36.490 --> 13:39.424
Nothing that can't be cleaned up
before you get home at 6:00.

13:39.526 --> 13:41.360
Oh, hey.

13:41.462 --> 13:43.328
Here's your sandwich, Dad.

13:43.397 --> 13:45.964
If anything has happened to the TV,

13:46.066 --> 13:47.733
this is a whole different discussion.

13:53.407 --> 13:54.406
Whoa.

13:54.508 --> 13:57.042
Oh, I like it, Ken.

13:57.111 --> 13:59.277
This was definitely worth hiring
those eight dog-sitters.

13:59.302 --> 14:00.221
Oh.

14:00.247 --> 14:01.847
What do you think, Bianca?

14:01.915 --> 14:06.051
Wow, I feel like a whole new person...

14:06.153 --> 14:07.686
named Bianca.

14:07.788 --> 14:10.021
You can take care of business out front.

14:10.124 --> 14:11.223
And we now accept Diners Club.

14:11.291 --> 14:12.257
Of course you do.

14:12.326 --> 14:13.525
Lovely to meet you gals.

14:13.627 --> 14:14.860
You two are a gas.

14:14.928 --> 14:16.895
Oh, come on. You two.

14:18.699 --> 14:20.632
We'll see you soon.

14:20.734 --> 14:21.666
Oh, huh.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.402
Mrs. Cleary,
I can't let you pay for that.

14:23.504 --> 14:25.637
I have no intention
of paying this amount.

14:25.706 --> 14:27.105
Helen never charged more than $10.

14:27.174 --> 14:29.040
And she'd take a buck off if you
brought your own shampoo.

14:29.143 --> 14:31.443
I'm gonna give 'em $20 for both of us.

14:31.545 --> 14:32.878
And that's more than fair.

14:32.946 --> 14:34.646
I don't think you get to choose
how much it costs.

14:34.715 --> 14:36.782
You do if you're heading out the back.

14:36.884 --> 14:37.783
You with me?

14:37.851 --> 14:39.518
You can't just...

14:43.791 --> 14:45.424
I can't believe you did that!

14:45.492 --> 14:47.626
Well, if you feel bad, you can
go give your hairdo back.

14:52.933 --> 14:56.568
"And as the green sun
set over the Vale of Lothar,

14:56.637 --> 14:58.837
Quaytar wondered if he would ever see

14:58.939 --> 15:00.739
his beloved Persefony again."

15:00.841 --> 15:02.040
Alright. You've suffered enough.

15:02.142 --> 15:03.108
You can come inside now.

15:03.210 --> 15:04.142
About dang time.

15:04.244 --> 15:05.710
I wasn't talking to you. William.

15:06.847 --> 15:09.281
No! Wait. Don't leave me out here.

15:09.349 --> 15:11.216
I don't even know what's
gonna happen to Quaytar.

15:11.285 --> 15:12.884
A-At least tell me how the story ends!

15:14.788 --> 15:16.254
Do you promise to keep your mouth shut

15:16.356 --> 15:17.656
when Mom comes home?

15:19.860 --> 15:21.860
Okay, untie him and read him the book.

15:21.962 --> 15:25.163
That was terrifying, Mrs. Cleary.

15:25.265 --> 15:27.499
You scare me.

15:27.601 --> 15:29.034
You know what scares me, hon?

15:29.136 --> 15:30.402
New people.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.771
Coming to my house,
sniffing around my family.

15:32.873 --> 15:35.440
It's not easy for me to trust.

15:35.509 --> 15:37.409
But you proved yourself to me today...

15:37.478 --> 15:40.045
backing me up the way you did
and stealing a hairdo.

15:40.113 --> 15:41.580
So this was all a...?

15:41.648 --> 15:43.315
A test.

15:43.383 --> 15:45.750
And you passed, Bianca.

15:45.853 --> 15:47.185
Your loyalty today almost makes up

15:47.287 --> 15:49.488
for the bald-faced lying you did
back at the house.

15:49.556 --> 15:53.158
Suddenly all worried
that I need a day off?

15:53.260 --> 15:54.926
Well, sure, you work so hard and...

15:55.028 --> 15:57.095
Stop. The last person
to pull one over on me

15:57.164 --> 15:58.864
was Bunny Delmonte.

15:58.932 --> 15:59.998
Never trusted that woman.

16:00.100 --> 16:00.899
But you went to her funeral.

16:01.001 --> 16:03.568
Just to make sure she was dead.

16:03.670 --> 16:05.437
So, are you ready to tell me the truth

16:05.506 --> 16:07.005
about what happened in Eddie's room?

16:07.074 --> 16:08.673
Yes, um...

16:08.775 --> 16:10.375
I'm sorry.

16:10.444 --> 16:12.677
There was this bottle
of Detroit Champagne

16:12.779 --> 16:14.513
that we were gonna drink
at the meteor shower tonight

16:14.615 --> 16:15.914
and...

16:16.016 --> 16:18.016
it broke.

16:18.118 --> 16:19.751
I broke it.

16:19.820 --> 16:20.952
You broke it?

16:21.054 --> 16:24.189
It was all my idea, <i>my</i> bottle of wine.

16:24.258 --> 16:25.891
And Eddie didn't know about it?

16:25.993 --> 16:27.158
No, ma'am.

16:27.227 --> 16:29.361
Well, I know for a fact that's a lie...

16:29.429 --> 16:30.362
Mrs. Cleary...

16:30.464 --> 16:32.597
But it's the right lie.

16:32.666 --> 16:34.799
As much as I appreciate
your loyalty to me,

16:34.868 --> 16:38.970
you protecting Eddie
is something I appreciate more.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.740
He's not my most devious offspring.

16:41.842 --> 16:44.609
He's gonna need people
who have his back.

16:44.711 --> 16:46.177
With the right friends, I could see him

16:46.246 --> 16:48.747
adding value to society one day.

16:48.815 --> 16:51.216
You know, as a milkman or something.

16:51.318 --> 16:52.450
He can do more than that.

16:52.553 --> 16:53.718
Calm down, honey. You got the job.

16:59.593 --> 17:02.561
I really admire how devoted you are
to your children, Mrs. Cleary.

17:02.663 --> 17:04.529
That I am.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.102
But I'm not fanatical about it.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.170
Keep driving.

17:14.407 --> 17:17.509
I think this is where our
journey with Tessie ends, Pat.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.444
It's okay to be sad, boy.

17:19.512 --> 17:22.213
This isn't "goodbye," it's just...

17:22.316 --> 17:24.449
Okay, bye!

17:29.690 --> 17:31.957
He'll turn up, sweetie, I swear.

17:33.126 --> 17:35.794
Do you understand why she's crying?

17:35.896 --> 17:39.998
I'd feel the same way
if I ever lost Tessie.

17:41.735 --> 17:43.268
I'm home!

17:50.677 --> 17:52.043
- Eddie.
- Mom.

17:52.145 --> 17:53.845
- House looks great.
- Thanks.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.614
I didn't get a chance
to start on my room,

17:55.682 --> 17:57.916
so it looks exactly how it did
when you left.

17:57.985 --> 18:00.118
I gotta say, Mom,
doing all your stuff for one day

18:00.220 --> 18:01.853
gave me a whole new appreciation.

18:03.156 --> 18:05.090
I finally get why you're so mean.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.662
What's that little pink speck
there on the crucifix?

18:10.764 --> 18:12.230
It's the blood of Christ.

18:12.332 --> 18:15.066
Look, it wipes right off.

18:15.168 --> 18:16.301
There.

18:16.403 --> 18:18.870
It's good as new.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.538
Hm.

18:22.542 --> 18:24.142
"As he left Crayton,

18:24.244 --> 18:26.911
he looked back at the nine rings
of his home planet

18:27.014 --> 18:31.149
and knew that his past
would always be his future."

18:34.388 --> 18:36.621
So <i> that's</i> the secret of Quaytar.

18:36.723 --> 18:40.125
Or is it?

18:40.227 --> 18:41.126
Whoa...

18:44.331 --> 18:46.197
I told you, Pop.

18:46.299 --> 18:48.333
I'm a man of my word.

18:50.604 --> 18:53.004
<i>Meantime, the Watergate
grand jury is back in session,</i>

18:53.106 --> 18:55.106
<i>calling dirty tricks expert...</i>

18:55.208 --> 18:57.075
Okay, then.

19:01.915 --> 19:03.915
<i>Even though we
often went our separate ways</i>

19:04.017 --> 19:05.550
<i>and had our own adventures,</i>

19:05.652 --> 19:07.419
<i>dinner was the time
we could come together</i>

19:07.521 --> 19:10.155
<i>as a family and avoid
talking about our day.</i>

19:10.257 --> 19:13.191
Eddie, good job with the
Stouffer's Frozen Lasagna.

19:13.293 --> 19:15.260
50 minutes at 425.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.630
I like the way Mom cuts it
into perfect squares.

19:18.732 --> 19:20.465
I don't know what to do with this mess.

19:20.567 --> 19:22.634
Nothing beats your mom's
meatloaf sandwich.

19:22.736 --> 19:24.436
Today's was the best ever.

19:24.538 --> 19:26.237
Tasted the same to me.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.440
- We need a dog.
- I vote no.

19:28.542 --> 19:29.574
Dog's a big responsibility.

19:29.676 --> 19:30.675
Not like a fish or a cat

19:30.777 --> 19:32.143
where it doesn't matter
if you keep it alive.

19:32.245 --> 19:34.179
- Mm-hmm.
- I can handle big responsibilities.

19:34.281 --> 19:35.747
Okay, then, we've got that leak
in the roof.

19:35.849 --> 19:37.482
You get up there and fix that,
then we'll talk dog.

19:37.584 --> 19:38.817
Yay!

19:39.820 --> 19:41.519
I cannot believe it.

19:41.621 --> 19:44.622
Is nobody even going to bring up
the real crime here today?

19:46.326 --> 19:48.993
The fact that no one
has even told Mom yet

19:49.096 --> 19:50.462
how lovely her hair looks.

19:50.564 --> 19:52.330
Oh, Frank.

19:52.355 --> 19:53.468
Thank you.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.766
Real nice hair, Peg.

19:54.868 --> 19:56.668
You could be one of those Gabor sisters.

19:56.770 --> 20:00.423
Yeah. You know,
I completely, 100% agree.

20:00.502 --> 20:02.072
Beautiful.

20:03.598 --> 20:05.097
Hm.

20:07.614 --> 20:08.713
Hi, Mrs. Cleary.

20:08.815 --> 20:10.426
Oh, there you are, Wendi.

20:10.489 --> 20:12.689
Aren't you gonna compliment her
on her hairdo?

20:12.791 --> 20:13.957
Yeah, of course.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.327
Look at all that.

20:17.429 --> 20:19.696
You ready to go?

20:19.798 --> 20:22.132
We're headed up to Hansen Dam
to watch the meteor shower.

20:22.234 --> 20:23.533
That's a lot of interest in Astronomy

20:23.635 --> 20:25.235
for a guy who got a C-minus.

20:25.337 --> 20:29.139
I believe my friend Wendi
is staying with us tonight.

20:29.241 --> 20:31.258
Your mom wants to teach me
how to decoupage.

20:31.367 --> 20:33.710
She's amazing and so crafty.

20:33.812 --> 20:35.773
She's definitely crafty.

20:35.852 --> 20:37.051
- Hm.
- Seems a shame

20:37.153 --> 20:39.487
to miss the Perseids Maximus tonight.

20:42.116 --> 20:44.449
- I'll go with you, buddy.
- Ah.
