00:58.333 --> 01:00.051
So do I get my kiss or not?

01:00.213 --> 01:02.169
Tara, the way mistletoe works is...

01:02.333 --> 01:05.848
...the one standing under it
is the one to receive.

01:06.013 --> 01:07.446
I prefer to meet in the middle.

01:08.333 --> 01:10.927
Well, I do enjoy your middle
tremendously.

01:11.093 --> 01:14.642
But a kiss really is more traditional.

01:20.573 --> 01:23.326
The anticipation is pure... Sally.

01:23.493 --> 01:26.690
Hi. The last thing I want to do
is come between all that collagen.

01:26.853 --> 01:28.650
But, Alan, we have a little problem.

01:28.813 --> 01:31.088
And like it or not,
you're the best man to fix it.

01:31.253 --> 01:33.847
This is Carmen Flores.
She works in housekeeping here.

01:34.013 --> 01:36.607
Her ex-husband
kidnapped her two children.

01:36.773 --> 01:38.968
This is the third Christmas
he's done so.

01:39.133 --> 01:42.762
He brings them to Peru when Carmen
has custody of them for the holidays.

01:42.933 --> 01:46.289
- Can't you just go to the judge?
- She did that last year.

01:46.893 --> 01:50.522
And it cost her a fortune. The judge
held him in contempt for a day.

01:51.013 --> 01:53.686
He said it's worth it to spend
Christmas with his kids.

01:54.133 --> 01:56.044
His flight leaves tomorrow night.

01:56.213 --> 01:58.522
I thought maybe
you could think of something.

01:58.853 --> 02:01.572
Didn't you used to be a lawyer, Sally?

02:01.733 --> 02:04.725
I apologize. There go my lips again.
Must be all that collagen.

02:04.933 --> 02:09.131
Ladies, perhaps you two should kiss
in the name of Christmas.

02:10.053 --> 02:13.090
- Oh... Sorry, Sally.
- Oh, my God.

02:13.253 --> 02:15.813
Incredible dress by the way. Hate you.

02:15.973 --> 02:18.533
Huh. Alan. Mistletoe.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.205
Whatever.

03:06.253 --> 03:08.721
ATTORNEY: She came home
that evening at 9:30...

03:08.893 --> 03:12.010
...catching an early flight
to surprise her husband.

03:12.173 --> 03:14.892
But it was the defendant
who was surprised.

03:15.053 --> 03:17.965
Susan May discovered
her husband, Ralph...

03:18.173 --> 03:22.166
...making love to a business associate,
Marie Holcomb...

03:22.333 --> 03:24.085
...and it was more
than she could bear.

03:24.573 --> 03:25.847
The evidence will show...

03:26.013 --> 03:28.811
...that the defendant retrieved
a handgun from the kitchen...

03:28.973 --> 03:32.249
...returned to the bedroom,
and fired six shots.

03:32.413 --> 03:35.564
Three into her husband,
three into Marie Holcomb.

03:40.493 --> 03:41.767
This is the holiday season.

03:42.453 --> 03:44.330
You should be home
with your families.

03:44.493 --> 03:46.051
I apologize for that.

03:46.613 --> 03:50.322
Marie Holcomb's mother and father
fly here every December...

03:50.493 --> 03:52.723
...from the West Coast.

03:53.253 --> 03:57.246
This time, it's to attend the trial
of their daughter's killer.

03:58.493 --> 04:03.362
Susan May destroyed a lot
of happy plans with that gun.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.403
- Get in Christmas.
- Sorry?

04:09.053 --> 04:12.932
Christmas is ours, and Susan's.
Don't let him claim it.

04:17.533 --> 04:19.569
I, too, would like to apologize...

04:19.733 --> 04:22.930
...for taking you away from your families
during this holiday season.

04:23.093 --> 04:25.402
That's Susan's family
seated over there.

04:25.573 --> 04:27.609
They would dearly love
to be home with her.

04:27.773 --> 04:29.764
She would dearly love
to be home with them.

04:30.293 --> 04:34.969
Imagine, if you can, as you prepare
for your Christmas...

04:35.133 --> 04:37.249
...having a loved one murdered.

04:37.413 --> 04:41.929
Add to that the horror that the police
can't figure out who did it.

04:42.093 --> 04:47.406
And then, if you can possibly fathom,
imagine they decide to arrest you.

04:50.293 --> 04:52.284
That's your defendant,
ladies and gentlemen.

04:52.453 --> 04:55.968
A law-abiding, loving,
faithful advertising executive.

04:56.133 --> 04:57.486
An innocent woman...

04:57.653 --> 05:00.963
...whose whole life was just suddenly
and wrongly destroyed.

05:01.613 --> 05:03.171
That's your defendant.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.324
And that's what
the evidence will show.

05:17.253 --> 05:19.130
I report police twice.

05:19.293 --> 05:20.726
They say domestic.

05:20.893 --> 05:23.965
- He returned the children both times?
- Yes.

05:24.133 --> 05:27.887
This why police say
it is for court to decide.

05:28.053 --> 05:30.089
No one involved.

05:30.493 --> 05:33.963
Ah, Denny. This is Carmen Flores.
She works here in housekeeping.

05:34.133 --> 05:36.727
- Excellent. Why do I care?
- Perhaps you don't.

05:36.893 --> 05:40.568
First off, let me say
how incredible you were last night.

05:40.733 --> 05:44.009
The whole office is still stunned.

05:46.013 --> 05:49.130
- Thank you.
- Now, on a topic far removed from you...

05:49.293 --> 05:53.081
...and therefore much less entertaining,
though of some import to Carmen...

05:53.253 --> 05:55.289
...her children have been snatched
by her ex.

05:55.453 --> 05:57.648
Who do you know
at the Boston Police Department?

05:57.813 --> 05:59.929
I know everybody.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.653
You hear that, Carmen?
The man knows everybody.

06:12.013 --> 06:14.368
Her story didn't check out.
It's as simple as that.

06:14.533 --> 06:16.649
That story she gave you was...?

06:16.813 --> 06:18.883
She came home,
found them dead in bed.

06:19.053 --> 06:22.284
Was there evidence of anyone other
than the victims or the defendant...

06:22.453 --> 06:24.171
...being in the house?
- None.

06:24.333 --> 06:27.166
And, detective, describe for the jury,
if you can...

06:27.333 --> 06:30.166
...the defendant's demeanor
when you arrived at the scene.

06:30.533 --> 06:32.728
She seemed pretty shook up.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.212
There was blood all over her.

06:34.693 --> 06:37.844
She claimed she got the blood on her
when she went to her husband...

06:38.013 --> 06:40.243
...to revive him.
- You don't believe that.

06:40.413 --> 06:42.085
I'm sorry.

06:42.253 --> 06:46.041
The detective is more than willing
to give testimony against my client.

06:46.213 --> 06:49.046
- You don't really need to lead him.
- Sustained.

06:50.253 --> 06:53.006
- Did you believe the defendant's claim?
- No.

06:53.173 --> 06:55.528
It was determined
she was standing 5 feet away...

06:55.693 --> 06:56.967
...when she fired the gun.

06:57.533 --> 06:59.569
I'm sorry. I hate to be a nuisance.

06:59.733 --> 07:01.928
Did I miss the point
where she fired the gun?

07:02.093 --> 07:03.208
Sustained.

07:05.293 --> 07:07.887
Detective, what, if anything...

07:08.053 --> 07:10.772
...led you to believe
that the defendant fired the gun?

07:10.933 --> 07:13.606
We did a trace metal test
which revealed she held the gun.

07:13.773 --> 07:15.491
And her fingerprints were on the gun.

07:15.693 --> 07:20.972
- Hm. Anything else?
- Her driver dropped her off at 9:30 p.m.

07:21.133 --> 07:22.851
She called the police at 11:07.

07:23.013 --> 07:26.244
She told us she discovered the bodies
soon after she entered the house.

07:26.413 --> 07:29.325
If so, why did she wait an hour
and a half to call the police?

07:30.213 --> 07:33.603
As I said, her story just didn't add up.

07:34.053 --> 07:36.965
It seems from your tone,
you consider this kind of a no-brainer.

07:37.133 --> 07:39.522
We applied all our mental faculties
just the same...

07:39.693 --> 07:42.002
...and concluded your client
committed the crime.

07:42.173 --> 07:44.892
You concluded quickly.
Placed her under arrest the next day.

07:45.053 --> 07:48.250
By the way, was the spatter analysis
done in a day?

07:48.413 --> 07:50.131
No. That came in later.

07:50.293 --> 07:53.649
I see. So when you placed Susan May
under arrest, you were going on...?

07:53.813 --> 07:57.249
- Her fingerprints were on the gun.
- It was her gun, was it not?

07:57.413 --> 07:58.687
The fingerprints were fresh.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.889
Got there when
she picked the gun up after?

08:01.053 --> 08:02.486
We also had motive.

08:02.653 --> 08:04.086
Her evasive demeanor.

08:04.253 --> 08:06.005
She called the police, did she not?

08:06.173 --> 08:07.492
Yes, but she wasn't truthful.

08:07.653 --> 08:10.042
Wasn't truthful when she said
she didn't shoot them?

08:10.213 --> 08:13.330
That, and she obviously wasn't truthful
about calling the police...

08:13.493 --> 08:15.324
...immediately
after finding the bodies.

08:15.493 --> 08:17.449
You had her examined
by a psychiatrist?

08:17.613 --> 08:20.286
- Yes.
- The psychiatrist said she was in shock?

08:20.453 --> 08:21.727
- Yes.
- Possible the shock...

08:21.893 --> 08:25.090
...of discovering her husband
caused the delay in calling the police?

08:25.253 --> 08:28.529
- I doubt that's what happened.
- Based on your psychiatric training?

08:28.693 --> 08:31.526
It's based on 30 years of experience
as a homicide detective.

08:31.693 --> 08:33.967
Thirty years as a homicide detective
told you...

08:34.133 --> 08:38.365
...that the delay in calling the police
could not have been caused by shock?

08:42.972 --> 08:45.646
Let's turn back
to the blood spatter evidence.

08:45.813 --> 08:48.805
This is the blouse my client
was wearing that evening, is it not?

08:48.973 --> 08:50.406
Yes.

08:50.773 --> 08:52.411
Lot of blood. That's all spattering?

08:52.573 --> 08:54.325
Most of that came
from handling bodies.

08:55.053 --> 08:57.487
So where's the spatter
you spoke of, detective?

08:58.093 --> 09:00.653
There are two elongated markings
on the left shoulder.

09:00.813 --> 09:02.769
- Right here? These tiny marks here?
- Yes.

09:02.933 --> 09:05.208
She supposedly fired six shots.

09:05.373 --> 09:06.726
There's only two tiny marks?

09:06.933 --> 09:10.164
The others are covered up with blood
from when she handled the bodies.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.801
- Did you analyze these marks yourself?
- I did.

09:12.973 --> 09:15.612
Are you the person in the police
department who does this?

09:15.773 --> 09:19.288
There are others, but I started in the lab.
So I'm trained as well.

09:19.453 --> 09:20.932
Anyone else who analyzed this?

09:21.093 --> 09:23.049
- We have a junior member...
- Junior member?

09:23.493 --> 09:24.767
It's a high-profile case.

09:25.653 --> 09:27.006
It went to a junior member?

09:27.173 --> 09:30.210
As I said, I analyzed the clothes
with my 30 years of experience...

09:30.373 --> 09:33.410
- Thirty years in the lab?
- No.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.087
- How many years in the lab?
- Five.

09:36.253 --> 09:38.892
- The junior member, how many years?
- I'm not sure.

09:39.053 --> 09:40.725
- More than five?
- I believe so.

09:41.053 --> 09:43.772
Just out of curiosity,
what was his finding?

09:44.413 --> 09:45.812
Inconclusive.

09:45.973 --> 09:48.328
He could not determine
that my client fired a gun?

09:48.493 --> 09:50.882
- Nor could he rule it out.
- He could not determine...

09:51.053 --> 09:52.566
...that my client fired a gun.

09:52.733 --> 09:55.201
Correct. But I determined she did.

09:55.373 --> 09:58.285
You trace metaled my client.
Did you test for powder residue?

09:58.453 --> 10:01.525
- Yes. She tested negative.
- Gee, how could that be?

10:01.693 --> 10:04.605
We determined that she wore gloves
when she fired the gun.

10:04.973 --> 10:08.602
Hm. So she was careful to wear gloves
when she shot them.

10:08.773 --> 10:11.333
Afterwards, she took the gloves off
and handled the gun.

10:11.493 --> 10:15.452
If she went into shock, she probably
made a mistake. Murderers often do.

10:15.613 --> 10:19.526
For the purpose of explaining the delay in
calling the police, you don't buy shock.

10:19.693 --> 10:22.685
But to explain why she picked up
the murder weapon barehanded...

10:22.853 --> 10:25.128
...after firing with gloves,
you do buy shock.

10:25.293 --> 10:27.523
- In fact, you seem to be selling it.
- Objection.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.172
Withdrawn.

10:29.333 --> 10:31.164
- Did you find the gloves?
- No.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.403
You searched the house?
I don't wanna presume.

10:33.573 --> 10:35.848
We searched the house.
We did not find the gloves.

10:36.013 --> 10:38.368
Any evidence of her leaving
after she came home?

10:39.373 --> 10:40.852
No.

10:43.213 --> 10:46.842
Any unsolved burglaries
in this neighborhood in the last year?

10:49.173 --> 10:50.447
A couple.

10:57.413 --> 10:59.608
That went well, right?

10:59.773 --> 11:01.206
It went extremely well.

11:01.373 --> 11:04.251
The problem, Susan,
as we've explained...

11:04.413 --> 11:06.688
...the burden of proof is really on us.

11:06.853 --> 11:09.162
I don't understand,
as much as you keep saying it.

11:09.453 --> 11:11.762
When you have the wife
being the only one there...

11:11.933 --> 11:14.527
...her fingerprints on the gun...
- We'll argue burglar...

11:14.693 --> 11:17.412
...but with no break in...
- So my chances are the same?

11:17.573 --> 11:19.803
No. We did very well
with the witness today.

11:19.973 --> 11:21.964
Our chances just got a little bit better.

11:22.133 --> 11:25.569
But if we just... We stick to the plan.

11:26.733 --> 11:29.725
We'd like you to meet
with Dr. Waylon one more time.

11:29.893 --> 11:31.531
- Why?
- In case we need to call him...

11:31.693 --> 11:33.012
...we wanna be ready.

11:35.173 --> 11:38.848
I'm not really comfortable
being treated like some patient.

11:39.013 --> 11:42.130
Susan, you put your life
in our hands, did you not?

11:42.293 --> 11:44.011
You need to let us do what we do.

11:44.733 --> 11:46.007
Can I ask you something?

11:47.733 --> 11:51.169
I'm not sure why
I wanna ask this now...

11:52.173 --> 11:53.447
...but do you believe me?

11:57.653 --> 12:00.531
I don't know.
I certainly want to believe you.

12:00.693 --> 12:02.126
But when I look at the evidence...

12:07.053 --> 12:09.442
I at least appreciate your candor.

12:10.893 --> 12:15.250
The question the jury's going
to be asking, "If not you, then who?"

12:16.053 --> 12:18.009
And we've got no answer for that.

12:32.733 --> 12:35.042
The fatal wounds for both victims
were to the head.

12:35.213 --> 12:36.612
Death was instantaneous.

12:37.533 --> 12:40.047
Doctor, were you able
to determine the time of death?

12:40.213 --> 12:42.807
Between 9:30 and 9:45 p.m.

12:43.693 --> 12:46.446
Doctor, did you examine
the stomach contents of the victims?

12:46.613 --> 12:48.012
- Yes.
- What did you find?

12:48.173 --> 12:50.004
They were both relatively full.

12:50.173 --> 12:52.209
How long does food stay
in the stomach...

12:52.373 --> 12:54.603
...before emptying
into the small intestine?

12:54.773 --> 12:56.001
One to two hours.

12:56.933 --> 12:59.925
So if the victims finished dining
by 7:30 as reported...

13:00.093 --> 13:02.209
...those stomachs
should have been empty...

13:02.373 --> 13:04.762
...unless they were killed
before 9:30, correct?

13:05.533 --> 13:08.491
Or unless they ate again
after leaving the restaurant.

13:08.693 --> 13:11.253
Were there any signs
that they had eaten at home?

13:11.413 --> 13:12.812
Dirty dishes, recent garbage?

- Killing baseball.

- Hockey?
- No salary cap, no hockey.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.525
- Soccer?
- Nobody cares.

13:57.773 --> 14:00.651
Your Honor,
the defense calls Susan May.

14:07.933 --> 14:11.084
It's just that we regard it more
as a domestic custody dispute.

14:11.253 --> 14:14.165
- Her recourse would be with probate.
- There's where we're wrong.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.642
I thought if you were
to grab somebody...

14:16.813 --> 14:19.611
...and haul them to a foreign country,
it would be a crime.

14:19.773 --> 14:21.729
- Well, I'll be damned.
- So we're wrong.

14:21.893 --> 14:25.203
By the way, does one need to be related
to the victim to escape charges?

There's this Junior Mint

14:27.533 --> 14:29.967
I might borrow her for a weekend.
Perhaps the Bahamas.

As we understand it,
the father brings the kids back.

14:32.973 --> 14:34.326
That's what I'd do. Joy ride.

- The children were kidnapped.

Let's have that be the one
and only time you tell me that.

15:21.973 --> 15:28.572
I was hurrying home because, well,
I had been away for about a week...

15:28.733 --> 15:30.849
...and I was excited to see him.

15:32.133 --> 15:33.646
And when you got home?

15:34.573 --> 15:36.211
I pulled into the garage...

15:36.373 --> 15:39.285
...went into the kitchen,
called out his name.

15:39.453 --> 15:43.048
His car was there,
so I was sure he was home.

15:43.213 --> 15:45.329
It was only about 9:30.

15:45.493 --> 15:48.246
I couldn't imagine him being in bed.

15:49.133 --> 15:53.365
But... he was.

15:53.533 --> 15:54.852
And not alone?

15:56.733 --> 15:58.007
No.

15:58.493 --> 16:00.688
What happened, Susan?

16:00.853 --> 16:03.208
I started upstairs.

16:03.373 --> 16:05.409
I called out his name again.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.643
Still no response.

16:07.813 --> 16:11.488
Then I went to the bedroom...

16:11.653 --> 16:13.166
...Iooked in.

16:15.053 --> 16:18.443
- And I saw it.
- Saw what?

16:19.453 --> 16:21.648
At first, just blood.

16:22.453 --> 16:25.251
And then I saw one body,
and then another.

16:26.573 --> 16:28.404
What did you do?

16:28.573 --> 16:30.211
I first screamed.

16:32.173 --> 16:34.323
I looked at my husband.

16:36.933 --> 16:40.448
His eyes were open,
and there was a hole in his temple.

16:41.213 --> 16:45.126
And I went to him to see
if he was still breathing.

16:46.453 --> 16:47.806
Was he?

16:50.013 --> 16:51.526
No.

to the police at some point.

- Do you remember calling the police?

17:17.252 --> 17:19.243
- No.
- Do you remember touching the gun?

17:19.853 --> 17:21.491
- No.
- Seeing the gun?

17:21.893 --> 17:23.723
No.

17:37.093 --> 17:41.086
That's a really convenient memory loss,
don't you think?

17:42.653 --> 17:45.850
You recall not doing it,
finding the bodies dead.

As for your fingerprints
on the weapon...

false information after...

of posttraumatic amnesia.

She saw her husband murdered
and it triggered a blackout.

19:28.653 --> 19:31.008
- She blacked out for an hour.
- In terms of memory.

19:31.173 --> 19:34.483
She wasn't unconscious. She could've
been sitting in a catatonic state.

19:34.973 --> 19:36.884
She possibly even watched television.

19:37.093 --> 19:42.326
The prosecution thinks
that her memory loss was... convenient.

19:42.493 --> 19:45.690
Well, I personally examined this woman
the day after the murders.

19:45.853 --> 19:48.447
She was suffering
from dissociative amnesia then...

19:48.613 --> 19:50.365

Thank you, doctor. He's your witness.

20:00.293 --> 20:01.726
I hope you're right.

You can't state
to a medical certainty...

20:04.773 --> 20:07.845
...that the defendant suffered
from posttraumatic amnesia, can you?

20:08.013 --> 20:09.446
To a medical certainty, no.

20:09.613 --> 20:13.208
And you can't medically
rule out the possibility...

20:13.373 --> 20:15.409
...that the defendant
pulled the trigger?

20:15.573 --> 20:17.928
- Bingo.
- No, I cannot rule it out.

20:18.093 --> 20:20.766
In fact, while I believe her version
of the events...

20:21.413 --> 20:24.644
...I make room
for a completely different scenario.

20:27.973 --> 20:29.406
Which is?

20:29.573 --> 20:32.645
Well, it's possible
she looked into this bedroom...

20:32.813 --> 20:35.088
...saw her husband making love
to another woman...

20:35.253 --> 20:37.289
...that threw her
into a dissociative state.

20:37.813 --> 20:40.850
And in that state, she shot them.

[PEOPLE GASPING]

I'm sorry, are...? You're now saying
maybe she killed them?

20:51.893 --> 20:53.963
I believe she found them dead
as she says.

20:54.133 --> 20:57.808
It's possible that she saw them making
love, went into a dissociative state...

20:57.973 --> 21:00.612
Something we refer to medically
as automatism.

21:00.773 --> 21:02.889
- And in that state,
she may have killed them.

21:03.213 --> 21:07.764
Then her brain creates a false memory
of something less horrifying to her.

21:10.093 --> 21:12.129
I have nothing further.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.248
Her brain created a false memory?

21:16.413 --> 21:19.530
Yes. Sometimes if a person's actions
are so repugnant to them...

21:19.693 --> 21:24.323
...they can actually create a false version
that is more psychologically acceptable.

21:24.493 --> 21:27.246
- And they believe this as the truth?
- Absolutely.

21:27.813 --> 21:31.362
So it's possible
that she committed the murders?

21:31.893 --> 21:35.727
No. Murder suggests an intent
she would've been incapable of.

21:35.893 --> 21:38.885
If she did this...
And I'm not saying that she did.

21:39.053 --> 21:41.328
- She would've likely
lost all conscious control.

21:41.493 --> 21:43.370
She would've acted outside herself.

21:43.533 --> 21:44.807
And as a defense...

21:44.973 --> 21:47.965
...her brain would've manufactured
this other memory...

21:48.133 --> 21:50.886
...that she walked in
and found them already dead.

21:51.093 --> 21:53.527
Your Honor, chambers.

21:53.693 --> 21:56.685
They just back-doored insanity.
That's an affirmative defense.

- They did not plead it.
- We're not arguing.

21:59.093 --> 22:02.324

she lost all conscious control.

22:02.493 --> 22:06.645

You impeached my client's truthfulness.

You said that she was feigning
her memory loss.

22:09.173 --> 22:11.812
You went beyond my cross.
Your Honor, this is a ploy.

22:11.973 --> 22:13.611
They're trying alternative defenses.

22:13.773 --> 22:17.891
A, she didn't do it,
and B, if she did do it, she was insane.

22:18.053 --> 22:19.850
You coached the witness
to get insanity?

22:20.013 --> 22:21.526
I called to rehabilitate...

22:21.813 --> 22:25.772
...to support her claim of memory loss.
- Knowing he believed the possibility...

22:25.933 --> 22:28.163
...that she committed murders
while dissociative.

22:28.333 --> 22:30.324
I did not elicit that testimony, he did.

22:30.493 --> 22:34.532
Your Honor, if we wanted to argue
insanity, we simply could have pled it.

22:34.733 --> 22:36.644
Except you don't
want to argue it, counsel.

22:36.853 --> 22:39.686
You want to argue not guilty
and have insanity as a fallback.

22:39.853 --> 22:43.209
- Two defenses for the price of one.
- I'm sure you'll properly instruct...

22:43.373 --> 22:46.570
...against insanity.
- Yes. And I'm sure the jury will listen.

22:47.093 --> 22:48.685

all this with your cross.

- Which was their plan.
- Maybe so.

So I'll ask you to think
about your children.

26:43.453 --> 26:47.162
If you go to prison,
they lose their father.

26:48.133 --> 26:52.251
With an arrest,
I'm gonna lose all custody.

26:53.013 --> 26:54.924
They already lost their father.

26:57.333 --> 27:00.166
The first forensic specialist
to analyze the blood patterns...

27:00.333 --> 27:02.005
...said they were inconclusive.

27:02.213 --> 27:04.443
This is a police expert by the way.

27:04.613 --> 27:08.208
He said the spatters could
not prove that she fired a gun.

27:08.413 --> 27:09.402
[SIREN WAILS]

27:10.813 --> 27:12.963
He's asking you to believe
that she wore gloves...

27:13.133 --> 27:14.930
...to explain the lack of residue.

27:15.253 --> 27:17.892
Then she took the gloves off
to handle the murder weapon.

27:19.053 --> 27:20.930
COP: Move, move.
- Possible it was a burglar.

27:21.813 --> 27:24.964
Prosecution certainly
can't eliminate the idea.

27:25.133 --> 27:29.411
And yes, possible that Susan May...

27:29.613 --> 27:31.922
...seeing her husband
with another woman...

27:32.093 --> 27:34.004
...went into a dissociative state...

27:34.213 --> 27:36.488
...acted outside of
her conscious control.

27:37.253 --> 27:42.008
But it doesn 't really matter whether
she pulled that trigger or not...

27:42.213 --> 27:45.603
...because she formed no
legal mental intent to do so...

27:45.773 --> 27:47.491
...which is an element of the crime.

27:47.693 --> 27:50.730
- Move, move, move.
- Reasonable doubt, whether or not...

27:50.933 --> 27:54.050
...she did it, no evidence
of intent, even if she did...

27:54.213 --> 27:56.522
...all leads to the same verdict...

27:57.453 --> 27:59.250
...not guilty.

28:00.093 --> 28:01.446
It's been almost 30 minutes.

28:03.933 --> 28:05.924
You have to know
the building is surrounded.

28:06.093 --> 28:08.812

- I don't care.

28:09.973 --> 28:11.292
My life has ended anyway.

No evidence of anyone else
being there but the defendant.

Time of death, 9:45,
15 minutes after she arrived home.

28:21.733 --> 28:24.293
As to why the defendant
waited a full hour and a half...

28:24.453 --> 28:27.092
...before calling the police... Oh, yes.

28:27.253 --> 28:30.245
The dissociative state.

28:30.413 --> 28:32.210
That's handy.

28:32.413 --> 28:36.326
However upset you may be, you must
realize that what you are doing is insane.

28:36.613 --> 28:39.047
I wonder why
they didn't plead insanity.

28:39.573 --> 28:42.292
Because there was no powder
residue on her hands?

28:42.933 --> 28:44.605
How to explain insanity...

28:44.813 --> 28:48.488
...yet have presence
of mind to wear gloves?

28:49.293 --> 28:51.204

Mr. Crane, I don't think
that's a good idea.

30:05.893 --> 30:09.363
- It's a fantastic idea.
- Denny, the police are already here.

under control.

- Ridiculous.

- Don't make it ring.

was about to shoot Mr. Shore...
