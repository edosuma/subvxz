00:00.219 --> 00:01.885
April: <i>Previously on </i> Chasing Life.

00:01.910 --> 00:04.628
And that camp for kids with
terminal illnesses is beautiful.

00:04.653 --> 00:06.243
Did he tell you, it might become a chain?

00:06.268 --> 00:07.655
- No!
- Well, that's a longer term plan.

00:07.680 --> 00:09.514
- Where's the book, George?
- I got rid of it.

00:09.549 --> 00:10.681
(Yelping)

00:10.734 --> 00:14.619
Thomas did want to end his
life, 'cause he was sick...

00:14.654 --> 00:16.476
And he wanted all of you
to be taken care of...

00:16.501 --> 00:18.122
And all he needed was my help.

00:18.158 --> 00:19.565
You helped him kill himself?

00:19.590 --> 00:21.943
George, what you did was basically murder.

00:21.968 --> 00:23.357
April, Natalie's gone.

00:28.118 --> 00:32.019
I can't believe a tree
came through this window...

00:32.055 --> 00:33.867
And I didn't even catch it on camera.

00:33.892 --> 00:36.118
Um, that's what you don't
believe from the other night?

00:36.143 --> 00:40.303
Not Dad hiding a secret
disease for 14 months?

00:40.411 --> 00:43.184
Not a secret from everyone. George knew.

00:44.077 --> 00:48.146
You guys, Dad was really
good at keeping secrets.

00:48.197 --> 00:50.931
We shouldn't be so surprised that
there's so many of them, okay?

00:50.956 --> 00:55.147
Right. Well, I hope Natalie's
really good at keeping secrets, too.

00:55.172 --> 00:56.512
Neither of you have heard from her?

00:56.537 --> 00:59.397
No. She hasn't called
or texted me back, but...

00:59.432 --> 01:02.778
I mean, come on, she's not gonna
like, go tell the cops or anything.

01:02.803 --> 01:05.570
Well, she's been quiet
on the social media front.

01:05.595 --> 01:08.563
Is a Natalie who hasn't instagrammed
in four days a Natalie we can trust?

01:08.588 --> 01:10.088
Brenna: Whatever.

01:10.113 --> 01:14.549
I'm going to go video chat with
grandma, if her webcam is finally setup.

01:14.574 --> 01:18.359
(Door opens, closes)

01:18.384 --> 01:20.400
Hello! Hey!

01:20.425 --> 01:23.209
I had to pick up pastries
for Jaclyn's morning meeting.

01:23.234 --> 01:25.034
I'm giving the Carvers first dibs.

01:25.059 --> 01:27.513
Also, it's a bribe. I need
to borrow your necklace...

01:27.538 --> 01:29.068
You know, the one with the teardrop pearl.

01:29.093 --> 01:32.167
(Sighs) We needed a couple c.c.'s
of sugar, and the necklace is yours.

01:32.192 --> 01:35.143
Perfect. I would've borrowed
Natalie's ruby pendant,

01:35.168 --> 01:37.368
but she took that with her when
she went <i> gone baby gone.</i>

01:37.393 --> 01:39.193
You haven't heard anything
from her, have you?

01:39.218 --> 01:42.336
No. But her note said that she
needed some distance from Boston.

01:42.361 --> 01:44.194
You guys don't know what
got her so riled up, do you?

01:44.219 --> 01:45.418
Hmm?

01:45.443 --> 01:47.343
- No.
- No idea.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.368
But you know Natalie.

01:49.393 --> 01:51.359
Well, yeah, she's no
stranger to drama, but...

01:51.384 --> 01:54.218
To skip town and right
before our rent is due...

01:54.243 --> 01:56.126
I'm sure there's a good explanation.

01:57.772 --> 01:59.805
Oh! Hey, your window's fixed.

01:59.888 --> 02:03.214
Now I can go back to checking my reflection
while the rest of you are talking.

02:03.738 --> 02:05.604
We should be happy our
house got off so easy.

02:05.629 --> 02:07.115
Did you hear what happened to Dominic?

02:07.140 --> 02:08.503
No. Is his house okay?

02:09.919 --> 02:13.587

Sync and corrections by Albanda
www.Addic7ed.com

02:31.691 --> 02:35.003
And upstairs, part of the
roof caved in under the weight.

02:35.028 --> 02:37.383
- I can't salvage any of it.
- (Camera clicking)

02:37.410 --> 02:40.478
Oh, my God, Dom, I'm so sorry.

02:42.585 --> 02:45.345
Are you gonna put the insurance
money back into the house?

02:45.377 --> 02:46.885
I'm still figuring that out.

02:46.926 --> 02:49.056
Well, I'm no contractor,

02:49.081 --> 02:51.281
but I think it still shows promise.

02:51.306 --> 02:54.284
And you know, I read somewhere
actually that walls are overrated.

02:54.309 --> 02:56.159
I think that was <i>Outside magazine.</i>

02:56.222 --> 02:58.422
(Chuckles) Well, it's your call...

02:58.474 --> 03:01.425
But this place obviously means
something to you and it just...

03:01.427 --> 03:03.143
Doesn't seem right to give up on it.

03:05.906 --> 03:07.560
- How are you doing?
- Hmm?

03:07.600 --> 03:10.400
The last time I saw
you, you were a little...

03:10.436 --> 03:11.692
Off.

03:12.154 --> 03:13.858
Well, clearly...

03:13.883 --> 03:16.863
Grief manifests itself
in unpredictable ways.

03:17.584 --> 03:21.302
I think we've put studio-54
April to bed, so to speak.

03:21.327 --> 03:23.076
Which April do we get next?

03:23.101 --> 03:24.467
I think writer April.

03:24.492 --> 03:28.210
I've written two more chapters
and a 22-page book proposal...

03:28.254 --> 03:30.254
Single-spaced and...

03:30.422 --> 03:31.588
Drum roll, please.

03:32.654 --> 03:34.401
I've been sending it out to lit agents.

03:34.493 --> 03:36.773
- I've already got one meeting.
- Nice.

03:36.798 --> 03:38.681
I like writer April.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.263
Can we keep her?

03:40.690 --> 03:42.761
Only if someone helps her get published.

03:44.637 --> 03:46.637
Dear literary agent...

03:46.639 --> 03:49.694
A secret family, marriage...

03:50.090 --> 03:52.307
Widowhood, a battle with cancer.

03:52.561 --> 03:54.511
My story is one of...

03:54.546 --> 03:57.564
Life-shaking events told
through a highly-personal lens.

03:59.219 --> 04:00.535
(Grunts)

04:00.563 --> 04:02.429
Feel good hit of the year.

04:02.454 --> 04:03.868
(Knock on door)

04:07.543 --> 04:09.576
Oh, Ruthie, hi!

04:09.628 --> 04:11.495
Come in. How are you?

04:11.547 --> 04:13.130
Good.

04:14.705 --> 04:17.839
Oh, um, yeah, I'm just
waving a syringe around.

04:22.424 --> 04:23.590
Be careful with that stuff.

04:23.642 --> 04:26.259
They'll take away your tour de France wins.

04:26.312 --> 04:28.611
It's for a new clinical trial. Just...

04:28.824 --> 04:30.909
Gotten way too comfortable
using it around the house.

04:30.934 --> 04:32.233
It's totally fine.

04:32.518 --> 04:35.285
I'm here about one of Leo's projects.

04:35.321 --> 04:36.520
The camp he was building.

04:36.555 --> 04:37.905
Is everything okay with it?

04:37.930 --> 04:39.400
Yeah, it's totally fine, actually...

04:39.425 --> 04:42.426
We're having a preview event
in a couple of days and...

04:42.461 --> 04:44.361
We all thought if you want to

04:44.413 --> 04:46.413
and there is no pressure, but...

04:46.448 --> 04:48.332
Maybe you'd like to cut the ribbon

04:48.367 --> 04:50.283
at the grand opening ceremony...

04:50.336 --> 04:52.402
And say a little something about Leo?

04:53.764 --> 04:55.473
- I'd love to.
- You would?

04:55.591 --> 04:57.683
That's so great to hear.

04:57.841 --> 04:59.207
Joaquin: <i> It's bizarre.</i>

04:59.545 --> 05:03.380
Your life essentially stops,
but everyone else's keeps going.

05:03.382 --> 05:06.299
Listen, I am thrilled I am in remission...

05:06.352 --> 05:07.788
And I could not be more grateful,

05:07.813 --> 05:10.137
but it also feels like...

05:10.189 --> 05:12.305
My cancer tied a rope around my waist...

05:12.358 --> 05:14.869
And can yank me back whenever it wants to.

05:14.894 --> 05:16.894
I see a lot of people nodding.

05:16.919 --> 05:18.190
I totally get it.

05:18.215 --> 05:20.499
You never really feel in the clear.

05:20.566 --> 05:23.567
As I got better, my mother got worse.

05:23.619 --> 05:27.320
Non-Hodgkin's. I was told I was in
remission the day after her funeral.

05:29.079 --> 05:32.914
So how does that loss affect
you in a day-to-day way?

05:33.245 --> 05:35.379
Uh, well...

05:35.414 --> 05:37.581
I started back up at work this week.

05:37.583 --> 05:40.350
Super-cool graphic design firm. I love it.

05:40.386 --> 05:45.422
But then someone will ask
how I'm doing and I wonder...

05:45.474 --> 05:47.474
"How much truth do you really want?

05:47.509 --> 05:52.596
"Do you want to hear about my dead mother
and my deep fears of getting sick again?"

05:52.648 --> 05:56.433
Or do I just say, "it's all good, bro"?

05:56.435 --> 05:58.928
I bet I can guess which
one has worked best.

05:58.953 --> 06:00.853
Yeah, no kidding.

06:00.878 --> 06:04.079
But it also feels gross,
you know? Dishonest.

06:04.104 --> 06:07.155
People don't want to hear the truth
though, even if they say they do.

06:07.180 --> 06:09.122
Well, April, exactly
what do you mean when you

06:09.147 --> 06:10.922
say "people don't want to hear the truth"?

06:11.305 --> 06:13.105
I don't know, I just...

06:13.430 --> 06:16.203
I feel like sometimes
ignorance really can be bliss.

06:20.263 --> 06:22.353
Wait, so you haven't read any of it?

06:22.378 --> 06:25.196
I got caught up in family stuff.

06:25.221 --> 06:27.104
What happened?

06:27.129 --> 06:30.447
Um, just fill me in on the story.

06:30.472 --> 06:34.314
Okay. Hamlet's uncle kills his
dad and gets with his mom...

06:34.339 --> 06:36.556
So Hamlet whines for a little while.

06:36.592 --> 06:40.377
It's basically The Lion King without
Elton John and a happy ending.

06:40.379 --> 06:43.659
Ow! That sounds totally insane.

06:44.091 --> 06:49.426
I think that Hamlet should change his
name and get the hell out of Denmark.

06:51.006 --> 06:52.889
Shakespeare provokes strong feelings.

06:57.312 --> 06:58.445
Brenna...

06:58.470 --> 07:01.354
I know that you definitely
want to buy a raffle ticket.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.319
- $5.
- Thanks,

07:03.344 --> 07:05.644
but raffle tickets aren't
on my vision board right now.

07:05.669 --> 07:08.203
But don't you want to help Finn?

07:08.340 --> 07:10.524
I'm raffling off my dad's
court-side Celtics tickets...

07:10.576 --> 07:13.935
To get him one of those cool blades
like that inspirational runner.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.457
I.e., the guy who murdered his girlfriend?

07:16.482 --> 07:18.448
He was only convicted on the lesser charge.

07:18.484 --> 07:23.203
So do you want to buy a ticket
to get Finn "back on track"?

07:23.873 --> 07:25.238
I made that up.

07:26.258 --> 07:27.435
Cute.

07:29.000 --> 07:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:38.769 --> 07:40.369
When were you gonna tell me?

07:40.394 --> 07:41.508
Never, maybe?

07:41.533 --> 07:42.816
I don't know. I don't love it.

07:42.841 --> 07:46.509
Feels like Sydney's telling
everyone to take pity on me.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.234
Wearing the mask again doesn't really help.

07:48.259 --> 07:51.194
You know, she's only doing this
for her college applications.

07:51.219 --> 07:54.087
Aw, I was your little pet project
and now you have to share me.

07:59.490 --> 08:01.241
I ran with William today...

08:01.266 --> 08:04.067
And the only thing I could think
to talk about was energy bars.

08:04.092 --> 08:07.860
Well, I pumped Beth for clues about
Natalie and couldn't tell her why.

08:07.885 --> 08:09.584
Did you get anything from her?

08:09.609 --> 08:12.710
Oh, she got in touch with
Natalie's boss at the Charles...

08:12.735 --> 08:16.884
And he said that she put her notice in
via email the morning after the blizzard.

08:16.909 --> 08:18.483
Did he know where she was going?

08:18.508 --> 08:19.696
No.

08:19.721 --> 08:22.606
Hey, stop acting like
Natalie's trying to destroy us.

08:22.631 --> 08:25.482
I mean, she's probably
just blowing off some steam.

08:25.507 --> 08:28.945
And there's a lot of steam, I'm sure,
but if she talks to the wrong person...

08:28.970 --> 08:30.597
She could do a lot of harm to this family.

08:30.622 --> 08:32.389
And with April's trial going well...

08:32.424 --> 08:35.325
There's still a part of me that
needs to know where her donor is.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.515
Even if I get to that step,
there's still plenty of time.

08:38.844 --> 08:39.905
And...

08:40.548 --> 08:42.869
You know, it wasn't easy for
us to hear what happened...

08:42.894 --> 08:45.828
And I'm sure it was
even harder for Natalie.

08:45.853 --> 08:48.587
She was in Florida and had no
idea George did what he did.

08:48.612 --> 08:53.296
It was a messed up situation
and George did the best he could.

08:54.343 --> 08:56.109
I'm not sure it's that easy.

08:56.134 --> 08:58.728
Well, if you have issues with him, fine.

08:58.750 --> 09:01.551
Just don't let it interfere
with my summer plans.

09:01.587 --> 09:06.323
Brenna, I can't let you stay with
George. I would assume you'd know that.

09:06.358 --> 09:07.966
Of course.

09:08.117 --> 09:11.752
Something goes wrong in the Carver
family, so let's make Brenna suffer.

09:11.777 --> 09:13.187
Why break the pattern now?

09:14.893 --> 09:16.070
(Sighs)

09:16.095 --> 09:17.430
I don't know what to do.

09:19.104 --> 09:22.398
Honestly, I wish Brenna
had not heard any of this.

09:22.423 --> 09:23.811
She'll talk when she's ready.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.230
- (Door bangs shut)
- Or...

09:26.255 --> 09:29.189
Maybe she won't talk
at all, like her father.

09:29.214 --> 09:31.124
Dad knew what he was doing.

09:32.928 --> 09:36.129
Sometimes when there's
real pain, it's just...

09:36.165 --> 09:38.362
Better to keep people at a distance.

09:38.612 --> 09:42.769
April, I hate that. I hate
hearing you accept what he did.

09:42.805 --> 09:44.738
What other choice do I have?

09:45.329 --> 09:47.262
When you were first diagnosed...

09:48.544 --> 09:51.526
You kept it to yourself
for as long as you could.

09:51.551 --> 09:55.482
And now you're closing yourself
off again. I saw it today.

09:55.484 --> 09:57.634
We don't talk about therapy at home.

09:57.669 --> 09:59.252
That was our agreement.

09:59.271 --> 10:02.155
I can't let you deal with this fear alone.

10:02.191 --> 10:04.357
Well, the fear is mine, Mom.

10:04.393 --> 10:06.326
The pain is mine!

10:06.669 --> 10:08.302
I'm trying to help you.

10:08.327 --> 10:10.709
Well, I'm sorry, but you can't.

10:17.257 --> 10:19.286
(Beth screaming)

10:19.370 --> 10:21.120
Oh, my God!

10:22.664 --> 10:24.631
Hey! (Gasping)

10:25.158 --> 10:27.337
Why does my best friend sound
like a Mariah Carey chorus?

10:27.362 --> 10:30.135
Normally I find her quirks
adorable, but this one's testing me.

10:30.160 --> 10:32.601
- I have this for you, too.
- Whoa. Okay, thank you. Hi.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.604
"Though many pieces felt
like tired re-treads,

10:35.629 --> 10:37.446
this chic piece of vintage throwback...

10:37.471 --> 10:40.238
"Proves that Jaclyn is still not
only an artist, but an iconoclast."

10:40.263 --> 10:42.274
But it's me! I'm an iconoclast!

10:42.299 --> 10:44.162
A few weeks ago, Jaclyn
said I could put one

10:44.187 --> 10:46.091
design in her show since
it had 42 outfits...

10:46.116 --> 10:48.038
And no one would ever
notice, but they noticed!

10:48.063 --> 10:51.131
They more than noticed, babe.
They highlighted. They singled out.

10:51.156 --> 10:54.223
My God! I am so damn proud of you.

10:54.248 --> 10:56.598
- (Device bleeps)
- Oh, you just got an email from Jaclyn.

10:56.962 --> 11:01.324
All it says is, "let's meet tomorrow
to discuss your future at the company."

11:01.349 --> 11:04.050
Oh, God. What if she saw that article?

11:04.075 --> 11:06.742
What if she's angry and jealous
and her blood sugar's low?

11:06.767 --> 11:09.798
Or far more likely, she saw the
write-up and wants to promote you.

11:09.890 --> 11:13.103
Yeah, Beth, I think you're about
to become a professional designer.

11:14.278 --> 11:16.278
(Laughing excitedly)

11:16.303 --> 11:18.403
Take that, <i>project runway
</i> rejection letters.

11:18.428 --> 11:21.811
Okay, look, just because she offers you
something doesn't mean you have to take it.

11:21.836 --> 11:24.355
Your design got the rave
reviews. You have the leverage.

11:24.380 --> 11:27.919
Right, she might just see you as an
assistant who's grateful for any offer.

11:27.944 --> 11:31.695
Exactly. It couldn't hurt to make her
think that she's not your only option.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.586
What do you mean, like, lie?

11:33.611 --> 11:35.778
It's not lying. It's negotiating.

11:35.848 --> 11:37.897
Speaking of, I've got to go convince a lit

11:37.922 --> 11:40.113
agent to sign me, and
I'm going to use you...

11:40.138 --> 11:41.838
As inspiration.

11:41.863 --> 11:43.326
- Good luck, honey.
- Bye.

11:43.351 --> 11:44.871
Negotiating's easy, babe.

11:44.896 --> 11:46.879
It's like on that episode of <i> Shark
tank </i> that we watched last week.

11:46.904 --> 11:48.187
Yeah, we made out during that.

11:48.212 --> 11:49.761
Right.

11:51.250 --> 11:54.084
Thomas Carver's daughter. This is exciting.

11:54.109 --> 11:55.770
And you've inherited his talents.

11:55.795 --> 11:57.695
I was really grabbed by your story.

11:57.720 --> 12:00.787
And before we dig in, I want to hear
what your goals are for this book.

12:00.812 --> 12:05.907
There are times during cancer and widowhood
where you just feel so lost and I...

12:05.932 --> 12:09.361
I really just hope my book can help
people in similar circumstances...

12:09.386 --> 12:10.575
Know they're not alone.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.200
Exactly what I'd hope you'd say.

12:12.225 --> 12:14.225
And for the millions that haven't
gone through what you have...

12:14.250 --> 12:16.704
This could generate some real
understanding and empathy.

12:17.292 --> 12:19.401
- Should we discuss my notes?
- Hmm?

12:20.578 --> 12:22.585
I'd love to hear your... notes.

12:22.610 --> 12:24.208
I'm worried about the second chapter.

12:24.233 --> 12:25.494
The one about losing Leo.

12:25.519 --> 12:28.120
I feel like your reporter voice is
over-shadowing your memoirist voice.

12:28.145 --> 12:30.145
I think you can dig deeper,
and get more personal.

12:30.170 --> 12:31.884
It is personal.

12:31.909 --> 12:33.214
Not personal enough.

12:33.239 --> 12:36.018
The reader needs to get under
your skin, inside of your head.

12:36.043 --> 12:39.845
I want to understand your pain, guilt,
and anger in a first-person perspective.

12:40.042 --> 12:42.927
Think Joan Didion, Mary
Karr, or Cheryl Strayed.

12:49.266 --> 12:51.199
Whose office is this?

12:51.765 --> 12:54.766
(Sighs) Well, Valerie lets
me borrow her office...

12:54.791 --> 12:56.644
Because, technically,
I'm still an assistant.

12:56.669 --> 13:00.583
But the partners like me, and they said
that if I sign a client and prove myself...

13:00.608 --> 13:02.161
I'll move right up the ranks.

13:02.186 --> 13:03.702
So you're not an actual agent?

13:03.727 --> 13:06.309
Any day now, and I really
would like to work with you.

13:06.334 --> 13:08.167
I feel like we can learn
a lot from each other.

13:08.192 --> 13:10.259
Well, I'm still meeting
with other people...

13:10.284 --> 13:14.053
But this has been great,
and I'll be in touch.

13:14.078 --> 13:15.778
Look forward to hearing from you.

13:17.784 --> 13:19.059
(Sighs)

13:20.216 --> 13:22.411
Dominic: It's only your first
meeting, you'll get others...

13:22.436 --> 13:24.386
They'll be with real agents.

13:24.411 --> 13:26.013
No one else has even gotten back to me yet.

13:26.038 --> 13:29.033
It's 22 pages, single space.
Give people time to read it.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.425
Not really big on patience these days.

13:31.450 --> 13:35.119
But, I am big on gifts.

13:35.144 --> 13:37.144
I saw this on my way over...

13:37.454 --> 13:40.276
And it seemed like good incentive
not to give up on the house.

13:41.009 --> 13:43.709
Wow! It's so official.

13:43.734 --> 13:44.899
So adult.

13:44.924 --> 13:47.792
Well, I figured since the
inside doesn't look great...

13:47.817 --> 13:49.650
At least the outside could be super-classy.

13:49.675 --> 13:50.774
(Knocking on door)

13:53.954 --> 13:55.120
- April.
- Danny.

13:55.155 --> 13:56.788
- Nice knocker.
- Wow.

13:56.823 --> 13:59.924
I needed someone to help me tear
down a moldy drywall at the house.

13:59.960 --> 14:01.962
So he called in the big guns.

14:01.987 --> 14:04.037
Hmm. Small-to-medium sized guns.

14:04.431 --> 14:07.196
We were thinking about hitting up
trivia night at the Charles tomorrow.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.404
You should come... If
you're still allowed inside.

14:09.429 --> 14:12.598
Actually, I'll be in the Berkshires.
I'm cutting the ribbon at Leo's camp.

14:12.623 --> 14:13.937
That's opening already?

14:13.962 --> 14:15.262
It's preview day.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.419
Show prospective campers and
their parents what they're in for.

14:17.444 --> 14:19.444
Hey, why don't I volunteer write
about it for <i>The Post?</i>

14:19.479 --> 14:21.413
It would be a story that
actually inspires people...

14:21.465 --> 14:23.348
Unlike all the other
assignments I've gotten lately.

14:23.367 --> 14:25.150
You're sick of writing concert reviews?

14:25.185 --> 14:27.052
Raquel keeps making me check
out bands with tumblr appeal.

14:27.104 --> 14:29.378
They're all starting to blend together.

14:29.465 --> 14:32.867
I mean, the more we can get word
out about the camp, the better.

14:33.027 --> 14:35.628
- Guess it makes sense to carpool?
- Yeah.

14:35.653 --> 14:36.963
Pick you up around 8:00 A.M.?

14:36.988 --> 14:38.531
I'll see you then.

14:39.082 --> 14:40.503
Later, Gupta.

14:41.626 --> 14:43.013
(Door shuts)

14:43.038 --> 14:44.820
So you're gonna ditch
trivia night for a fun,

14:44.845 --> 14:46.588
innocent day trip with
your ex-girlfriend...

14:46.613 --> 14:48.379
to her dead husband's camp for sick kids.

14:49.910 --> 14:51.693
That should be a totally normal experience.

14:58.613 --> 14:59.745
(Kids playing)

15:01.766 --> 15:05.735
Leo was very insistent there
be a zip line. So we have three.

15:05.787 --> 15:07.820
The man liked his heights and speeds.

15:07.822 --> 15:12.341
Per his instructions, we also recreated
the aggro crag on the east side of camp...

15:12.393 --> 15:14.443
Although we had to disable
the glitter explosions.

15:14.495 --> 15:16.328
Environmental harm?

15:19.517 --> 15:21.214
You're still good to say something?

15:21.239 --> 15:23.269
It doesn't have to be anything long...

15:23.304 --> 15:24.706
Just something from the heart about Leo.

15:24.731 --> 15:26.060
Of course, no problem.

15:27.996 --> 15:30.057
Hey, if you're not ready
to speak, you don't have to.

15:30.082 --> 15:32.558
- Everyone would understand.
- It's no big deal.

15:33.115 --> 15:35.999
Everyone, please welcome April Carver.

15:36.024 --> 15:37.673
(All cheering)

15:41.643 --> 15:43.809
Thank you all for coming here today.

15:44.042 --> 15:46.759
Leo wanted this camp to
be something special...

15:46.794 --> 15:49.662
And I think, if you look around
you'll see his wish came true.

15:50.238 --> 15:54.288
He believed in adventure, and I
hope you all have a lot of them here.

15:54.313 --> 15:58.000
If you only know one
thing about Leo, it's...

16:00.284 --> 16:01.466
It's...

16:03.594 --> 16:05.428
I just want people to know that Leo...

16:14.912 --> 16:16.762
Was a really good guy.

16:16.787 --> 16:17.920
(Indistinct muttering)

16:19.243 --> 16:20.491
Thanks.

16:24.265 --> 16:25.831
Camp's open!

16:25.867 --> 16:26.949
(All cheering)

16:32.469 --> 16:35.319
Miss Carver, do you have an
official statement on the mess hall?

16:36.811 --> 16:39.278
I thought the neutropenic
sundae bar was a nice touch.

16:39.755 --> 16:40.973
How are you doing?

16:40.998 --> 16:42.581
Being here in the land that Leo built?

16:43.917 --> 16:46.171
I can't believe I just said
he was a "really good guy."

16:46.213 --> 16:49.315
I'll admit, it surprised me. Never has
been your favorite meaningless phrase.

16:49.540 --> 16:50.706
I was just...

16:52.012 --> 16:54.688
I was looking out at those
strangers' faces and...

16:55.496 --> 16:57.496
They don't want my sincerity.

16:57.532 --> 17:00.266
They don't want to hear
how hard it is for me...

17:00.318 --> 17:03.369
To swallow my pain and my secrets
just to make it through the day.

17:03.404 --> 17:06.271
You know, if I uncork everything
that's going on in my head...

17:06.273 --> 17:09.040
Everyone will end up
just as miserable as I am.

17:09.093 --> 17:10.843
Misery loves company.

17:12.146 --> 17:14.540
- I can handle it.
- (Sighs)

17:14.565 --> 17:17.598
I'm sorry, I just... I
need to be alone right now.

17:21.823 --> 17:23.132
Jaclyn: <i> Yeah, I'll hold.</i>

17:23.156 --> 17:24.857
You know, I tried to do you a favor...

17:24.892 --> 17:27.726
Putting your design in my show
and you steal the spotlight?

17:27.762 --> 17:29.762
You know, you make it all about you!

17:29.797 --> 17:32.781
Oh, God, Jaclyn, I didn't
mean to steal anything.

17:32.834 --> 17:36.435
I am so grateful that you included my
design. I mean, I can't thank you enough.

17:36.470 --> 17:37.820
Okay, good. You're still humble.

17:37.872 --> 17:40.539
Now, as you know, I find your
design to be perfectly acceptable...

17:40.575 --> 17:43.959
But the press, of course,
it seems has found it just...

17:44.162 --> 17:45.277
Transcendent.

17:45.313 --> 17:48.280
So, investors love buzz,

17:48.316 --> 17:51.967
and you, for the moment, have
created some for the label.

17:52.003 --> 17:53.451
Well, anything for the label.

17:53.476 --> 17:55.020
It's refreshing to hear you say that.

17:55.265 --> 17:59.150
I want to reward your
loyalty with a promotion...

17:59.994 --> 18:01.794
To junior designer, what do you say?

18:01.829 --> 18:05.357
I... I have to think about it.

18:05.382 --> 18:08.233
You know? I mean, I do have
some other offers on the table.

18:08.258 --> 18:10.436
I need to get a sense
of who values my talents.

18:10.471 --> 18:12.204
Oh, really? Huh!

18:12.229 --> 18:13.596
Who are these other offers?

18:13.621 --> 18:16.472
Don't tell me Georgio, because I
know he is in Ibiza till flag day.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.699
Well, actually, I was
just thinking I deserve

18:18.724 --> 18:20.574
a higher job title than junior designer.

18:20.615 --> 18:22.464
Oh! Um...

18:22.500 --> 18:25.517
Like associate executive...

18:26.129 --> 18:28.053
Junior designer?

18:28.089 --> 18:30.189
- Well, yeah.
- That job title doesn't exist.

18:30.224 --> 18:33.533
So, no, you're out of your element here.
What do you think about my original offer?

18:35.491 --> 18:38.625
I think I want to be a junior designer.

18:38.650 --> 18:42.385
Excellent. I will have the contract
sent over to you by the end of the day.

18:42.837 --> 18:46.505
Natalie: Lie, as the person whose
existence he denied for years.

18:46.530 --> 18:47.620
Sara: Hey! (Knock on door)

18:47.645 --> 18:49.608
Brenna: Well, technically,
he didn't deny your existence.

18:49.644 --> 18:50.776
No one asked him.

18:50.828 --> 18:53.462
(Sighs) I know you've
been avoiding me lately...

18:53.497 --> 18:56.582
But I just wanted to show you these
other summer film programs I found.

18:56.617 --> 18:58.550
They're all just as good as Berkeley.

18:58.586 --> 19:02.321
I'm going to Berkeley, and
I'm staying with Uncle George.

19:02.373 --> 19:04.390
April's loaded now. She can pay for it.

19:04.596 --> 19:07.311
It's not about the money,
Brenna, and you know it.

19:07.956 --> 19:11.407
Look, we're all angry right now and
after what you found out about your dad...

19:11.432 --> 19:14.033
I wouldn't blame you for being mad.

19:14.085 --> 19:15.167
I'm not mad.

19:17.238 --> 19:19.285
I swear, I'm not. I'm just...

19:19.957 --> 19:21.163
I don't know...

19:22.710 --> 19:23.776
Confused.

19:23.778 --> 19:25.744
Well, I understand that.

19:25.780 --> 19:27.997
I mean, (Scoffs) I really do.

19:28.049 --> 19:29.527
Yeah, like...

19:29.558 --> 19:32.511
I've been reading about
the symptoms of A.L.S.

19:33.688 --> 19:35.882
How did you not notice any of them?

19:37.625 --> 19:40.626
Well, I thought it was alcoholism,
that's what it seemed like...

19:40.661 --> 19:43.195
And that's what he wanted me to believe.

19:44.382 --> 19:45.464
Well...

19:46.097 --> 19:48.686
Maybe you should've been
paying better attention.

19:50.808 --> 19:52.775
I told that man...

19:52.800 --> 19:55.151
That I would be with him
in sickness and in health...

19:55.176 --> 19:57.142
But he never gave me that chance.

19:57.178 --> 20:01.355
He had no problem turning his back on me...

20:01.749 --> 20:03.231
And on this whole family.

20:06.887 --> 20:09.922
But if you need to blame me because
I'm the one who's actually here...

20:12.643 --> 20:14.264
Then I'll wear that target.

20:22.938 --> 20:24.274
(Ducks quacking)

20:27.801 --> 20:28.900
(Boy grunting)

20:36.577 --> 20:37.709
Need a little help?

20:37.761 --> 20:41.285
I had it under control, but if you insist.

20:42.533 --> 20:43.699
Okay.

20:43.734 --> 20:45.417
Here we go.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.552
There we go.

20:47.554 --> 20:51.323
How about you do the
navigating while I row.

20:51.871 --> 20:54.038
Teamwork. I like it.

20:59.650 --> 21:02.277
You were married to the guy
the camp's named after, right?

21:02.302 --> 21:04.610
Leo Hendrie. Yeah.

21:05.017 --> 21:07.196
Was he really a billionaire?

21:07.958 --> 21:09.658
(Sighing) More or less.

21:09.683 --> 21:12.253
So... he was like Batman?

21:12.532 --> 21:14.065
Oh! Uh...

21:14.812 --> 21:17.065
I guess there are some ways
he was like Batman, I mean...

21:17.101 --> 21:19.584
He didn't have a utility
belt or anything...

21:19.620 --> 21:23.423
But he was committed to truth,
justice, and the American way.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.837
That's Superman.

21:24.925 --> 21:27.859
How can Superman be American?
He's from another planet.

21:27.895 --> 21:30.479
Batman's a good guy...

21:30.514 --> 21:33.323
But sometimes he's kind of a mean good guy.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.895
Leo wasn't a mean good guy.

21:37.237 --> 21:38.503
He could be frustrating...

21:38.539 --> 21:41.273
And he'd get angry for stupid reasons...

21:41.308 --> 21:43.051
And jealous when he didn't need to be.

21:44.077 --> 21:48.380
He would use sarcasm as a
defense mechanism, all the time.

21:48.415 --> 21:51.407
And he was a slob. Oh, my God.

21:52.186 --> 21:54.770
So he wasn't a hero, then?

21:56.190 --> 21:57.789
He was a man.

21:59.059 --> 22:00.625
He was my man.

22:00.661 --> 22:01.743
I'm sorry.

22:05.516 --> 22:08.867
Sometimes, I only think
about the annoying things...

22:08.919 --> 22:11.878
Because it makes it hurt less...

22:13.186 --> 22:15.018
(Voice breaking) And I
just end up missing the

22:15.043 --> 22:16.754
annoying things as much as the good things.

22:16.779 --> 22:18.679
And then I get angry...

22:20.247 --> 22:23.972
Because every morning, for a few seconds...

22:25.319 --> 22:27.185
(Sighing) I think that life's okay.

22:28.338 --> 22:29.354
(Sniffles)

22:32.059 --> 22:34.092
Then I remember I'm alone.

22:34.127 --> 22:37.443
You're not alone. I'm here.

22:37.468 --> 22:38.660
(Chuckles)

22:39.483 --> 22:41.616
Thank you for that.

22:42.052 --> 22:44.703
You are a good conversationalist.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.495
Can't row a boat alone.

22:50.777 --> 22:53.378
Did you see this? Clause 36-H?

22:53.380 --> 22:54.596
Uh, I saw it.

22:54.631 --> 22:57.616
Did I also read it and
process it? Not entirely.

22:57.651 --> 22:59.584
It's one of those extreme ownership...

22:59.620 --> 23:02.220
And exclusivity clauses that
they use in Silicon Valley.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.539
Basically, any design that you create...

23:04.575 --> 23:07.192
While working for Jaclyn
is owned by Jaclyn.

23:07.227 --> 23:10.228
Oh, well, I guess that seems fair, right?

23:10.280 --> 23:14.809
No, but even if you design it for a
friend or yourself, Jaclyn still owns it.

23:15.536 --> 23:18.203
You have metric tons of
creativity in that mind of yours...

23:18.238 --> 23:21.261
And Jaclyn gets to put her name on
all of it, for the next five years.

23:23.076 --> 23:24.776
No, wait, why do you even care so much?

23:26.864 --> 23:28.864
We've only been dating for a month.

23:28.899 --> 23:31.492
You don't have to read the
fine-print on my paperwork.

23:32.803 --> 23:34.703
If you want me to back off, I will.

23:34.738 --> 23:37.422
But you're so amazing
and you're so talented...

23:37.474 --> 23:39.852
And I don't want you to come home
from work five years from now...

23:39.877 --> 23:42.594
To tell me that Jaclyn
appropriated all your best ideas.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.229
So, you, uh...

23:45.728 --> 23:47.918
You picture us together in five years?

23:47.943 --> 23:49.190
(Scoffs)

23:49.898 --> 23:51.307
You make me so happy.

23:52.306 --> 23:53.939
More than anyone I've ever met.

23:55.075 --> 23:57.241
I want to be happy five
years from now, too.

24:10.401 --> 24:13.409
Let's tell Jaclyn what the next
five years should look like.

24:14.278 --> 24:15.419
All right.

24:16.597 --> 24:17.629
(Sighs)

24:17.664 --> 24:19.564
(Playing harmonica)

24:22.753 --> 24:24.436
Girl's got lungs.

24:24.471 --> 24:26.371
Hey! Oh!

24:26.406 --> 24:28.356
And you've got, if I'm
seeing it in the light

24:28.381 --> 24:30.118
correctly, something resembling a smile.

24:31.361 --> 24:33.912
I just needed to be alone...

24:33.964 --> 24:35.550
And then not alone...

24:35.777 --> 24:37.660
Then even less alone.

24:38.316 --> 24:42.216
You don't know this, but my dad he didn't
talk about a lot. He kept a lot of secrets.

24:42.241 --> 24:44.089
No, I do know.

24:44.124 --> 24:45.924
I dated one of them.

24:47.222 --> 24:49.533
I used to think that he
was just doing it for us...

24:49.558 --> 24:52.159
And maybe to some degree
he was, but I think...

24:52.687 --> 24:56.332
I think we would've all been happier
if he'd have just let us into his life.

24:56.425 --> 24:58.458
Like maybe you would've been...

24:58.572 --> 25:00.341
When you were diagnosed?

25:01.742 --> 25:03.274
Maybe.

25:04.527 --> 25:07.947
I can't change what I did back then,
that doesn't mean I have to repeat it.

25:07.972 --> 25:10.741
Leo believed in living
openly and I shouldn't

25:10.766 --> 25:13.172
give up on that just because he's gone.

25:13.425 --> 25:16.626
I don't know what happened to
you in the last few hours, but...

25:16.651 --> 25:18.964
You should bottle it and sell it.

25:20.490 --> 25:22.356
I went boating with a new friend.

25:22.381 --> 25:24.214
It gave me some perspective.

25:24.239 --> 25:25.939
Let me know if you have any leftover.

25:25.964 --> 25:27.500
I could use some for my own life...

25:27.525 --> 25:30.376
Big decision on the house,
uninspired at my job.

25:30.411 --> 25:32.261
I'd love a good life-coaching session.

25:32.296 --> 25:34.548
Well, you know how I feel about the house.

25:34.573 --> 25:36.690
As far as <i>The Post</i> goes...

25:36.715 --> 25:39.399
How many shows have you reviewed this year?

25:39.424 --> 25:42.091
I don't know. Probably a hundred.

25:42.267 --> 25:44.139
You want perspective?

25:45.292 --> 25:47.987
Try experiencing it from
the musician's point of view.

25:48.012 --> 25:51.340
I've heard you mess around
on the guitar. You're good.

25:51.422 --> 25:53.678
(Laughs) I... come on, I...

25:53.925 --> 25:55.439
I don't even have my guitar here.

25:55.464 --> 25:57.614
Oh, my God! It's camp!
Somebody has a guitar.

25:58.612 --> 26:00.270
Come on, what have you got to lose?

26:00.429 --> 26:02.678
Every day is supposed
to be an adventure here.

26:03.849 --> 26:06.279
Just don't play <i> free fallin'.</i>

26:06.464 --> 26:07.697
Deal.

26:08.283 --> 26:09.983
(All applauding)

26:18.480 --> 26:20.332
Here's a guitar. Thank you.

26:26.649 --> 26:28.266
Hello, everyone.

26:28.291 --> 26:29.374
(All responding)

26:31.595 --> 26:34.356
I don't normally do this,
but a friend convinced me to.

26:34.381 --> 26:38.050
So, this song is for that friend.

26:47.356 --> 26:50.707
<i>♪ Talking like we used to do ♪</i>

26:50.732 --> 26:53.631

(Vocalizing)

27:53.889 --> 27:55.787

27:57.775 --> 27:58.958
(All applauding)

28:07.531 --> 28:09.414
Sydney: We've reached our halfway point!

28:09.449 --> 28:13.870
Continue to donate and Finn Madill
will be back on track in no time!

28:14.042 --> 28:17.930
(Sighs) Okay. This stupid
humiliation game has got to end.

28:17.955 --> 28:19.709
- I'm talking to her.
- No. Please don't.

28:19.734 --> 28:20.962
She's just trying to be nice,

28:20.987 --> 28:23.077
and I really do want that running blade.

28:24.081 --> 28:26.631
Brenna! You want to double
down on your donation?

28:26.667 --> 28:30.193
Listen, Sydney, if you need community
service to get into Middlebury...

28:30.218 --> 28:32.351
Go read your magazines at a nursing home.

28:32.428 --> 28:34.773
Stop turning my friend into a charity case.

28:34.825 --> 28:37.859
Middlebury? What are you
talking about, you psycho?

28:37.911 --> 28:41.596
We all know that you're only
doing this for your college apps.

28:41.598 --> 28:43.698
This is not about my college applications.

28:43.734 --> 28:47.702
So just what? Out of nowhere,
you suddenly care about Finn?

28:47.738 --> 28:51.306
I've known Finn for years.
I've always liked him, okay?

28:53.895 --> 28:57.643
Junior ball's coming up and...
(Sighs) I want to be on his radar.

28:57.668 --> 28:59.314
Wait, you like him?

28:59.349 --> 29:01.333
Like, you like-like him?

29:01.385 --> 29:03.068
Why do you care?

29:03.103 --> 29:05.286
Wait... are you jealous?

29:05.322 --> 29:08.289
(Laughs) Wow.

29:08.342 --> 29:10.175
I mean, it makes sense you'd be into him.

29:10.227 --> 29:12.744
You're probably into me, too.

29:12.796 --> 29:14.479
You're like, bi or something, right?

29:15.132 --> 29:16.385
(Students murmuring)

29:18.869 --> 29:20.091
You bitch!

29:23.991 --> 29:27.642
Natalie: <i> You've reached Natalie. Learn
how to text or leave me a message.</i>

29:27.678 --> 29:28.710
(Bleeps)

29:28.745 --> 29:32.514
Hey, Natalie, it's Sara again, um...

29:32.549 --> 29:36.584
I know you're probably getting sick
of seeing my name on your phone...

29:36.620 --> 29:40.171
But there's just a lot at stake here and...

29:40.223 --> 29:42.403
I really want to protect this family.

29:43.260 --> 29:45.907
I don't know what kind of
mother would I be if I didn't?

29:47.264 --> 29:51.466
Um, it seems like April's trial is working.

29:53.036 --> 29:55.336
(Sighs) You know what? You can hate us...

29:55.372 --> 29:57.222
That's fine.

29:57.274 --> 30:00.025
But, at the end of the
day, I'm just hoping that...

30:00.060 --> 30:02.420
We all want the same things here.

30:04.181 --> 30:07.389
(Sighs) Believe it or not,
we do love you, Natalie.

30:10.921 --> 30:12.059
Okay. Um...

30:13.857 --> 30:14.956
(Phone ringing)

30:16.893 --> 30:17.994
Natalie?

30:20.447 --> 30:21.663
Wait, she... what?

30:23.350 --> 30:24.532
With Shakespeare?

30:28.238 --> 30:29.571
(Banging on door)

30:31.024 --> 30:35.126
(Sighing) God, I swear, the pizza guy
is getting more and more aggressive.

30:39.516 --> 30:41.015
What the hell is this?

30:41.068 --> 30:45.420
Uh, those are certain addendums
and alterations I would like made...

30:45.455 --> 30:47.138
Before I sign any dotted lines.

30:47.174 --> 30:49.023
You know this is a classic millennial move.

30:49.076 --> 30:51.907
It's all about entitlement
with your generation, isn't it?

30:51.932 --> 30:53.845
You said the investors crave buzz.

30:53.897 --> 30:55.947
Well, I'm your beehive.

30:55.982 --> 30:57.739
I think you need me more than I need you.

30:59.008 --> 31:02.907
I suppose that perhaps, I could
make a couple of concessions.

31:02.939 --> 31:05.657
Exclusivity and idea ownership?

31:05.709 --> 31:08.037
I guess I can take that
down from five years to two.

31:08.204 --> 31:12.430
And I want a... $500 weekly raise.

31:12.466 --> 31:13.616
(Scoffs) $200.

31:13.641 --> 31:15.474
- $400.
- $325, final offer.

31:17.704 --> 31:19.287
Pleasure doing business with you.

31:20.557 --> 31:23.191
Oh, God, look at those lines.

31:23.193 --> 31:27.128
Ha! This is absolutely going
to be a Jaclyn exclusive.

31:27.130 --> 31:30.584
Okay, I will see you in the morning and
now that the weather is a little warmer...

31:30.609 --> 31:34.176
I will need some fresh melon,
but please no honey dew this time.

31:36.106 --> 31:37.409
Do it.

31:37.472 --> 31:39.174
Jaclyn, I can't work for you.

31:39.814 --> 31:40.959
(Laughing)

31:41.011 --> 31:42.243
Oh, Beth...

31:42.279 --> 31:44.012
You're just a regular Ashton Kutcher.

31:44.047 --> 31:46.915
I am so thankful for everything
that you've taught me...

31:46.917 --> 31:49.851
But I think you'll always just
see me as an assistant and...

31:49.903 --> 31:53.037
I'm ready to move on and try succeeding
in this business on my own name.

31:53.771 --> 31:55.517
I'm in my 20's...

31:55.592 --> 31:57.749
It's the perfect time to
start blazing my own trail.

31:59.175 --> 32:02.602
Okay. Well, I think you know
not to use me as a reference.

32:08.605 --> 32:09.760
(Door shuts)

32:15.328 --> 32:16.608
I always wanted to do that.

32:18.716 --> 32:21.063
I'm not going to lie, I'm
surprised to see you again.

32:21.088 --> 32:23.077
I was starting to think you
brushed me off last time.

32:23.119 --> 32:24.586
I did.

32:24.638 --> 32:28.289
But I couldn't stop thinking about the
notes you gave me, and you were right...

32:28.325 --> 32:32.420
Nobody's going to care about my story
if it's all fact and no feeling, so...

32:32.863 --> 32:34.145
I wrote another chapter...

32:34.197 --> 32:37.799
And I think you'll see, it digs
into some pretty personal stuff.

32:41.248 --> 32:42.647
Wow.

32:42.672 --> 32:45.406
This is the kind of writing that
we can waive in front of publishers.

32:46.086 --> 32:47.705
Let's not waste any time.

32:47.744 --> 32:49.460
Can you get me two more chapters by Monday?

32:49.512 --> 32:50.682
That fast?

32:50.707 --> 32:53.469
If you can write this in 48 hours,
I want to see what else you can do.

32:53.494 --> 32:55.178
Also, I want to get your book on the market

32:55.203 --> 32:57.391
quickly, so I can stop
borrowing Valerie's office.

33:06.642 --> 33:09.409
Heard you answered the
age-old question today...

33:09.445 --> 33:11.511
To beat or not to beat?

33:11.547 --> 33:15.296
Even Shakespeare couldn't
describe how lame that was.

33:15.516 --> 33:18.496
I was hoping my lameness
would cheer you up a little.

33:19.154 --> 33:22.155
You got suspended for
book-slapping a girl.

33:23.561 --> 33:24.958
What is going on with you?

33:25.027 --> 33:26.193
It's not a big deal.

33:26.228 --> 33:28.425
You're avoiding me and Mom.

33:28.450 --> 33:30.975
You won't talk about what
happened with Dad and George.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.701
Trust me, Bren, it feels
so much better to talk.

33:36.223 --> 33:38.143
Let's talk about Dad right now.

33:40.776 --> 33:44.198
I know we're not who you
want to talk to about Dad...

33:44.223 --> 33:46.649
But we're the only ones you can talk to.

33:47.057 --> 33:48.705
There's nothing to say.

33:49.284 --> 33:50.350
I get it.

33:50.386 --> 33:54.221
When you're ready to
talk, we won't judge...

33:54.256 --> 33:56.023
And we won't try to give advice.

33:56.025 --> 33:57.743
We'll just listen.

34:03.927 --> 34:05.793
You didn't know him...

34:06.235 --> 34:07.669
Not like I did...

34:09.893 --> 34:11.172
Not at the end.

34:15.408 --> 34:17.420
He taught me how to play cribbage...

34:19.161 --> 34:20.719
And I finally beat him...

34:20.792 --> 34:23.283
Right before he left for the last time.

34:23.975 --> 34:25.808
And we'd go get frozen yogurt.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.248
He would always put...

34:29.511 --> 34:32.245
A single gummy bear at
the bottom of my bowl.

34:33.965 --> 34:37.065
I'm glad the two of you
had that time together.

34:37.739 --> 34:40.074
And you were away at college.

34:41.858 --> 34:44.672
And you and him had your issues, but...

34:46.237 --> 34:48.054
I was there.

34:48.942 --> 34:54.145
I was right there, and I
thought that we were close.

34:57.834 --> 35:00.768
Why didn't he tell me that he was dying?

35:03.007 --> 35:05.443
And why couldn't he tell me?

35:06.203 --> 35:07.577
I don't know.

35:08.210 --> 35:09.609
I wish I did.

35:10.340 --> 35:11.840
April: I think I know.

35:16.453 --> 35:18.486
He wanted his suffering to be his.

35:18.638 --> 35:20.405
His alone.

35:21.337 --> 35:23.337
And it was selfish...

35:23.559 --> 35:25.537
And it was misguided...

35:27.300 --> 35:29.167
But in his own way, it was...

35:30.996 --> 35:32.598
An act of love.

35:33.997 --> 35:35.797
Like everyone...

35:35.822 --> 35:38.740
Your father was a mess of contradictions.

35:38.765 --> 35:41.428
I think we forget that about
people once they're gone.

35:41.605 --> 35:45.140
Everything I love gets
taken away from me...

35:46.663 --> 35:48.598
And it all started with him.

35:49.705 --> 35:52.066
I just want there to be
something in my life...

35:52.683 --> 35:54.537
That I can hold on to.

35:54.848 --> 35:56.447
That's what we are.

35:56.472 --> 35:58.318
April: Brenna, we are here for you.

35:58.749 --> 36:00.782
We are always going to listen to you...

36:01.225 --> 36:03.225
Sara: And we're always
going to tell you the truth.

36:03.982 --> 36:05.114
Promise.

36:08.369 --> 36:10.469
And the kids were amazing.

36:11.077 --> 36:13.550
I won't hit an open mic anytime soon...

36:13.575 --> 36:15.934
But I think it really helped
shake me out of my funk.

36:16.171 --> 36:17.769
I owe her one.

36:17.811 --> 36:21.396
April does exude a sense
of monk-like wisdom. Cheers.

36:22.091 --> 36:23.789
What's her take on your pile o' rubble?

36:23.814 --> 36:26.781
She says rebuild. What do you say?

36:26.834 --> 36:28.783
Cut your losses and move on.

36:28.819 --> 36:30.321
But I say that about everything.

36:30.346 --> 36:32.997
If something's failed, light
it on fire and watch it burn...

36:33.022 --> 36:35.275
In your rear-view mirror as you
drive your way to successtown.

36:35.325 --> 36:36.746
Ah! Maybe you're right.

36:36.771 --> 36:39.196
But I'm also not ready
to give up on this place.

36:39.221 --> 36:40.887
It was the future I wanted to build.

36:40.912 --> 36:42.745
I don't think mother
nature felt the same way.

36:43.453 --> 36:45.653
I really cared about it. I still do...

36:45.797 --> 36:47.850
And I believe it could
be something special.

36:48.318 --> 36:51.166
But you know, the house has
also been through so much...

36:51.191 --> 36:53.436
And sometimes that feels
like a sign to give up.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.790
Maybe it's not a sign to give up.

36:55.843 --> 36:58.858
Maybe it's a sign to fight for what I want.

36:58.883 --> 37:02.212
Because moving on with regrets
isn't really moving on at all.

37:02.237 --> 37:03.421
Oh, wow.

37:03.512 --> 37:05.198
You think you're talking about a house, but

37:05.223 --> 37:07.156
you're totally talking
about April, aren't you?

37:07.181 --> 37:08.227
Huh?

37:08.252 --> 37:10.212
You're still in love
with her! Dude, I knew it!

37:10.237 --> 37:11.747
Or at least I heavily suspected it!

37:11.772 --> 37:13.555
Please don't say anything, okay?

37:14.545 --> 37:18.113
Damn. You've been nursing
that broken heart for a while.

37:18.138 --> 37:19.420
All right.

37:19.529 --> 37:21.389
Do you want some advice from a pro?

37:21.414 --> 37:23.281
Do you still want those
free Kendrick tickets?

37:23.808 --> 37:25.039
I'mma shut up now.

37:28.756 --> 37:31.857
Well, if you need any help with the
derivatives, feel free to call me.

37:31.882 --> 37:33.515
Thanks.

37:33.699 --> 37:34.965
I probably will.

37:37.148 --> 37:38.681
How's Sydney doing?

37:38.706 --> 37:41.475
Well, after your little publicity stunt...

37:41.500 --> 37:43.648
Got a lot of people talking
about the raffle, so...

37:43.673 --> 37:45.594
She's feeling pretty good actually.

37:46.359 --> 37:48.459
She raised all the money?

37:48.581 --> 37:49.658
Yeah.

37:49.694 --> 37:52.395
This summer I'll be a
certified blade runner.

37:53.370 --> 37:55.822
Well, that's amazing.

37:56.401 --> 37:59.302
And you're okay with, you know...

37:59.424 --> 38:00.874
All that charity?

38:00.899 --> 38:04.467
If I have to choose between ego and
running again, it's not a hard choice.

38:04.492 --> 38:06.525
And thank you, by the way...

38:06.580 --> 38:09.381
For your unorthodox marketing style.

38:09.406 --> 38:15.043
I will dedicate my victory lap to
your creative use of Shakespeare.

38:17.121 --> 38:19.838
Sorry, I got so territorial.

38:21.724 --> 38:22.756
But, um...

38:23.786 --> 38:25.185
Like you said...

38:26.760 --> 38:28.727
I didn't want to share my pet project.

38:42.434 --> 38:45.883
I, um, left a little evidence.

38:45.923 --> 38:48.382
Cool, it's proof cancer
hasn't killed my game.

38:48.407 --> 38:49.790
(Giggling)

38:52.856 --> 38:54.084
(Bell rings)

38:55.366 --> 38:56.543
Hello.

39:00.358 --> 39:02.192
(Whispering) Hey, hey.

39:02.217 --> 39:03.366
It's Natalie.

39:03.391 --> 39:05.483
What? Can I talk to her? Please. Please.

39:05.508 --> 39:08.434
Hey, Natalie, April's
here. She just wants to...

39:08.634 --> 39:10.483
Okay. Just one second.

39:10.610 --> 39:12.743
Natalie, hi! Where are you?

39:12.842 --> 39:15.760
I'm home. In Florida...

39:15.785 --> 39:18.186
Where I clearly belong.

39:18.534 --> 39:20.150
I'm happy to hear you're okay.

39:21.471 --> 39:23.338
We were worried about you.

39:23.363 --> 39:27.065
Worried that I was spilling
Carver secrets to the cops?

39:27.090 --> 39:30.158
<i>You can put your paranoia to
rest. I won't say anything.</i>

39:31.451 --> 39:32.750
I knew you wouldn't.

39:33.301 --> 39:36.917
And look, I know things
are complicated, but...

39:37.505 --> 39:39.789
You're my sister and I care about you.

39:40.433 --> 39:41.632
Right.

39:42.005 --> 39:45.188
Well, I'm sorry I've been out of touch...

39:45.213 --> 39:49.048
But I needed a break
from all things Carver.

39:49.073 --> 39:52.008
<i>And if your clinical trial
works, I'll be there for you.</i>

39:52.033 --> 39:56.235
But right now... All I want is space.

40:02.721 --> 40:04.687
(Sighing) Well, I'm relieved she's safe.

40:04.817 --> 40:06.083
Yeah. Me, too.

40:06.108 --> 40:09.843
I'm also relieved that she
mailed in her final rent check.

40:09.868 --> 40:11.652
- Final?
- Yeah.

40:11.963 --> 40:15.130
She said she's out of town indefinitely,
so I should just find a new roommate.

40:15.978 --> 40:17.806
I mean, you've either
been complaining about

40:17.831 --> 40:19.349
your house or avoiding it altogether,

40:19.374 --> 40:20.602
so...

40:20.627 --> 40:22.576
I know it's only because
Natalie ran away...

40:22.601 --> 40:25.892
But is the dream of a Beth-April
apartment actually happening right now?

40:25.917 --> 40:27.700
- It is.
- Oh my God!

40:27.725 --> 40:29.057
And it's going to be amazing.

40:29.082 --> 40:30.749
I'm gonna go find us some champagne.

40:30.774 --> 40:34.692
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna put
my stuff in... my room.

40:34.875 --> 40:36.958
- (Laughs)
- Okay. Do it, woman.

40:39.692 --> 40:41.225
(Chuckles)

40:46.686 --> 40:49.006
I knew you shouldn't have stayed in Boston.

40:49.643 --> 40:53.178
They've always treated us
like second-class citizens.

40:54.692 --> 40:56.725
I guess I had to learn the hard way.

40:56.750 --> 40:59.534
Well, at least you got the truth out of it.

40:59.559 --> 41:01.393
And I've never really trusted George.

41:01.629 --> 41:05.964
None of it would have even come up if
he hadn't destroyed a manuscript I found.

41:08.148 --> 41:09.613
What manuscript?

41:09.638 --> 41:12.522
Some spy novel Dad was working on.

41:12.547 --> 41:14.446
I only found the first part, though.

41:15.187 --> 41:16.731
Oh, yeah, I know that book.

41:16.779 --> 41:19.232
I've got a copy of the
whole thing back at home.

41:20.660 --> 41:22.527
It's an interesting story.
