00:35.769 --> 00:39.398
This is what I love about high-school parties.
People will gather anywhere...

00:39.573 --> 00:42.508
...as long as there's alcohol
and the chance of hooking up.

00:42.676 --> 00:45.804
If I recall, you're the one
who wanted to come to this party.

00:45.979 --> 00:50.609
I didn't know it was gonna be so cold.
It's like 20,000 degrees below zero.

00:50.784 --> 00:54.151
- It doesn't feel that cold to me.
- What, are you from an ice planet?

00:54.321 --> 00:57.051
I'm gonna go thaw out by the fire.

00:57.824 --> 00:59.121
Have fun.

01:09.603 --> 01:10.865
Hey, Kent.

01:11.771 --> 01:15.036
You're friends with Chloe.
Is she flying solo tonight?

01:15.208 --> 01:17.335
Believe me, Sean, you're not her type.

01:21.648 --> 01:23.445
Well, you'd be surprised.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.822
If you want, I could rub them for you.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.920
Well, nothing heats up the body
like friction.

01:37.197 --> 01:41.293
Wow. I can't believe you just delivered
that line with a straight face.

01:41.468 --> 01:43.936
All I did was offer to keep
your hands warm, Chloe.

01:44.404 --> 01:48.841
<i>- And he knows my name.
- I've read your editorials in the Torch.</i>

01:49.976 --> 01:52.103
- Pretty cool.
- Well, thank you, Sean.

01:52.612 --> 01:56.810
I sit next to Jenna in bio class.
Remember, you dumped her last week?

01:57.183 --> 02:02.052
- It was mutual.
- So you're here trolling for fresh meat.

02:02.222 --> 02:05.487
Don't worry, Chloe.
I'm not gonna make a move on you.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.889
No matter how pretty I think you are.

02:08.061 --> 02:10.928
Sean, Hail Marys down by the lake.

02:11.398 --> 02:12.695
Yeah.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.931
- Hey, can I get your number?
- Why? You're never going to call.

02:18.104 --> 02:23.667
- I'll call you tomorrow. I promise.
- Well, I won't hold my breath.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.154
- Come on, Sean, let's go.
- Hey, Whitney, back pass.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.565
Did you just write your phone number
down on Sean Kelvin's hand?

02:54.841 --> 02:56.365
Don't sound so shocked, Clark.

02:56.543 --> 03:00.172
Guys do find me attractive even though
I don't have raven hair and the initials "L.L."

03:00.347 --> 03:02.008
That's not what I meant.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.980
- The guy's a dog.
- Clark, relax.

03:05.151 --> 03:09.952
I just gave him my number to get rid
of him. Get Pete. The taxi's leaving.

03:14.127 --> 03:17.119
- What's with you and that Chloe Sullivan?
- What do you mean?

03:17.297 --> 03:21.324
<i>- The girl from the Torch. You into her?
- Another notch, dog.</i>

03:21.701 --> 03:23.498
That's cold.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.868
Hey, hold on, pizza's here.

03:29.209 --> 03:33.578
- Sorry, dude.
- Go ahead. I'll get the ball.

03:39.619 --> 03:41.018
Whoa.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.091
Hey, where's Sean?

04:22.262 --> 04:24.958
I don't know. He's probably
in the back of some car.

06:50.176 --> 06:54.442
- The distributor gets 12.5.
- Feed bill over six months at 5%.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.548
Plus the mortgage at 8.2.

06:56.716 --> 06:59.617
- Plus the harvester repairs gives us-
- Fifty-four thousand...

06:59.786 --> 07:02.755
...five hundred and one dollars
and thirty-eight cents.

07:03.756 --> 07:07.453
Hey, son. Look, I'm sorry. We didn't
mean for you to hear all that.

07:07.627 --> 07:09.993
You don't have to protect me.
Is it that bad?

07:10.163 --> 07:12.324
It's pretty bad.
We might have to take out a loan.

07:12.498 --> 07:15.797
- Another one? The interest would put us-
- Clark, don't.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.899
- Maybe I can help.
- You have.

07:19.072 --> 07:22.303
- Last season you saved us four hands.
- I'm thinking bigger picture.

07:22.475 --> 07:26.275
Forget about this whole high-school thing
and try out for a pro sports team.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.937
I could make a ton of money
in endorsements.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.049
Just trying to lighten the mood.

07:32.218 --> 07:35.051
Much as we'd love to see
your face on a cereal box...

07:35.221 --> 07:38.554
...we'd settle for you getting
to school on time.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.325
Forgot.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.088
- That's 65,200-
- Go.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.563
And one.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.535
- So did Sean call?
- Negative.

07:53.706 --> 07:56.004
Not that I was waiting by the phone
or anything.

07:56.175 --> 08:00.009
Maybe he got caught up. One time
my sister didn't hear from a guy for a week.

08:00.179 --> 08:02.079
Turned out his grandmother died.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.183
As much as I appreciate
the spotlight here, I'm fine.

08:05.351 --> 08:08.081
You're probably better off.
Sean's a total dog anyway.

08:08.254 --> 08:11.052
He's not that bad, Clark.
He's always been cool to me.

08:11.224 --> 08:15.092
Because you can't get past your Lana crush,
don't knock us for making a love connection.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.751
I thought we were focusing on me.

08:16.929 --> 08:19.261
- I don't have a crush on Lana.
- Then ask another girl out.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.694
- Like who?
- Like Chloe.

08:20.867 --> 08:24.030
I'm not a crash-test dummy you
can use to try out your dating skills.

08:24.203 --> 08:26.569
You, if you like Lana so much...

08:26.739 --> 08:28.502
...why don't you just ask her out?

08:28.675 --> 08:30.870
And, you,
stop acting like a Vegas bookie...

08:31.044 --> 08:35.003
...picks your dates.
And both of you? Treat me better.

08:49.429 --> 08:53.490
This is the flu season, young man.
I don't even know why you came in today.

08:53.666 --> 08:57.295
I felt fine this morning,
and now I can't get warm.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.533
Let's see.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.703
This can't be right.
You're not a Popsicle.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.778
Let's try again.

09:08.915 --> 09:10.382
Here we go.

09:17.357 --> 09:21.054
Now you're giving me the chills.
I'm sending you home.

09:22.662 --> 09:28.692
I'm all right. I'm actually feeling
a little better now. Thanks.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.779
Whoa!

09:43.549 --> 09:44.846
I come in peace.

09:45.284 --> 09:49.311
- I'm so sorry. I didn't hear you.
- I'm just glad you weren't welding.

09:49.489 --> 09:53.016
- What brings you out here?
- Those artichokes of yours.

09:53.192 --> 09:56.127
- I need about 30 if you've got them.
- Thirty. That's a lot.

09:56.295 --> 09:59.093
I'm hosting a dinner tomorrow
for the local farming community.

09:59.265 --> 10:03.326
Just a talk about some financial options.
A lot of farms are having money trouble.

10:03.503 --> 10:08.202
- Most people aren't looking for more loans.
- I'm offering my role as an investor.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.536
Help people modernize and expand.

10:12.712 --> 10:15.647
This town once grew
20% of the corn in the state.

10:15.815 --> 10:19.615
Smallville was a heavy hitter.
It just lost the drive to stay competitive.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.344
Or its connections.

10:21.521 --> 10:25.457
If this town ever had connections,
they wouldn't have named it Smallville.

10:29.028 --> 10:31.826
Your husband hasn't kept
his feelings about me a secret.

10:32.131 --> 10:35.760
I'd appreciate hearing your thoughts,
even if you're not interested.

10:35.935 --> 10:41.567
Jonathan doesn't hate you. It's just, your
family's track record hasn't been the best.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.936
Tell him I intend to change that.

11:00.193 --> 11:03.094
That's a great exhibit.
Caught it in St. Petersburg.

11:03.262 --> 11:06.663
Whitney and I are going to Metropolis.
I thought we'd check it out.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.960
Trying to give the quarterback some culture?

11:09.135 --> 11:10.397
It was his idea.

11:10.570 --> 11:13.971
He figures one afternoon at the museum,
he's off the hook for six months.

11:14.140 --> 11:17.200
For someone who wants people
to keep an open mind...

11:17.376 --> 11:19.276
- ... you're quick to judge.
- Hey, Whitney.

11:19.445 --> 11:22.437
What can I say? I just think
you're with the wrong guy.

11:26.452 --> 11:27.714
Hey.

11:29.622 --> 11:30.953
Everything okay?

11:31.123 --> 11:34.217
Yeah, I was just checking out
some stuff for us to do tomorrow.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.429
Metropolis, remember?

11:42.034 --> 11:46.733
Some of the guys are pulling together
and getting the fight on pay-per-view.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.666
It's tomorrow.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.176
And you gave them your money already.

11:53.312 --> 11:54.836
Yeah.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.616
Hey, we'll go next weekend, okay?
I promise.

12:01.287 --> 12:04.779
- I'm really sorry, Lana.
- Culture can wait.

12:05.591 --> 12:07.456
I'll make it up to you.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.022
See you.

12:24.810 --> 12:28.177
You know, she's free tomorrow night.
Hey, Clark.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.112
This is the perfect time
for you to ask her out.

12:32.285 --> 12:33.946
She's got a boyfriend, Lex.

12:34.120 --> 12:37.556
A high-school boyfriend
isn't a husband, he's an obstacle.

12:37.723 --> 12:42.023
I bet if you ask Lana to go with you
to the Radiohead concert, she'll say yes.

12:43.729 --> 12:47.028
- And if she says yes?
- I'll give you the tickets.

12:49.869 --> 12:51.530
Why are you doing this?

12:52.004 --> 12:56.498
You're like the younger brother I never had.
Someone should benefit from my experience.

12:56.676 --> 12:59.042
- I can't just ask her out.
- The hardest thing...

12:59.211 --> 13:01.736
...is telling the girl you love
that you like her.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.978
I'll raise the bet.
You ask her in the next 60 seconds...

13:06.152 --> 13:10.418
...you get the tickets and I'll throw in
a roundtrip limo ride. Starting now.

13:23.102 --> 13:26.037
- Hey, Lana, you busy?
- Completely swamped.

13:26.205 --> 13:30.869
That's why I'm sitting in a coffee shop
trying to wade through a Russian classic.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.642
That was a joke, Clark.

13:36.616 --> 13:40.143
Good. Because there's this
thing tomorrow night.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.184
Define "thing. "

13:42.355 --> 13:46.189
It's a concert. Radiohead, to be exact,
and I've got a couple of tickets.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.192
Wow. Where'd you get these?

13:50.096 --> 13:52.360
A friend. Something came up
at the last minute...

13:52.531 --> 13:55.432
...and I was wondering if you'd like to go,
you know, with me.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.930
- I'd-
- Just as friends.

14:02.308 --> 14:05.436
Definitely. I'd love to.

14:08.814 --> 14:12.045
Let me get this straight.
You walked in to get a cappuccino...

14:12.218 --> 14:14.482
...and walked out with a date
with Lana Lang.

14:14.654 --> 14:15.916
It's not actually a date.

14:16.088 --> 14:18.488
Even with the "just as friends" rider,
I'm impressed.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.023
How did you score the tickets?

14:20.192 --> 14:23.628
I'm guessing a certain follically challenged
individual was behind it.

14:23.796 --> 14:26.356
Lex hooked me up.
Actually, Chloe, I have you to thank.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.433
- What did I do?
- You were right. I just had to get it out.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.934
Well, good. I'm glad.

14:36.342 --> 14:38.207
Maybe this is your chance.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.446
Chloe, don't I owe you a phone call?

14:44.150 --> 14:46.380
- I guess so.
- What are you doing right now?

14:46.986 --> 14:49.045
Well, I've got to put the paper to bed.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.416
Maybe afterwards we could
do something.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.927
Jenna, Jenna, wait up.

15:03.369 --> 15:07.203
Okay, I was playing barely
hard to get. What's the problem?

15:08.974 --> 15:10.805
Clark Kent gets a date
with Lana Lang...

15:10.976 --> 15:13.911
...and suddenly there's no luck
left for the rest of us.

15:46.011 --> 15:48.036
Sean, is that you?

15:52.585 --> 15:54.610
I've been waiting for you.

15:55.054 --> 15:57.522
Thought you might like
to take a shower.

16:03.362 --> 16:04.693
Sean?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.204
Well, what are you waiting for?

16:19.645 --> 16:22.079
The water's nice and warm.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.085
Sean?

16:33.225 --> 16:35.591
Sean, what happened to you?

16:50.943 --> 16:54.709
I'm sorry, but I don't know
what's wrong with me.

16:57.783 --> 17:01.378
Sean, you're really scaring me.
What do you want?

17:01.887 --> 17:04.821
I just want to get warm.

17:53.305 --> 17:57.401
It's bad enough you ride that motorcycle,
but do you have to repair it in the house?

17:57.576 --> 18:00.170
If I didn't, you'd never
have a reason to be angry with me.

18:00.346 --> 18:04.578
I'll trade you. Do all the engine work
you want, but come with me to Lex's.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.412
- We've already talked about that.
- I talked, you grunted.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.952
I thought that I was rather articulate.

18:10.122 --> 18:13.888
Sweetheart, the Luthors have sold out
anyone who's ever trusted them.

18:14.059 --> 18:15.822
They don't keep their word.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.087
"They" is Lex's father, not him.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.359
Be honest, you've never seen him
be anything but generous.

18:22.534 --> 18:26.402
Arrogant and a little strange, yes,
but he's been a good friend to Clark.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.107
- We have to at least hear him out.
- Why?

18:29.275 --> 18:33.871
We need options, Jonathan.
Our home is on the line. Our farm.

18:34.046 --> 18:37.880
You don't have to like him to listen.
Besides...

18:38.517 --> 18:40.610
...I already told him we would come.

18:42.021 --> 18:45.286
- Hello, citizens.
- I'm not familiar with this child.

18:45.457 --> 18:49.223
- Where's the moody one, lives upstairs?
- He's going on a date tonight.

18:49.395 --> 18:53.559
- Not a "date" date, but to a concert.
- Who might this "not a 'date' date" be with?

18:53.732 --> 18:55.131
Lana Lang.

18:55.968 --> 18:58.232
Lex hooked me up with
tickets and his limo.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.565
- He did?
- It's okay if I go, right?

19:01.273 --> 19:05.073
Well, I guess Lex Luthor has worked
out all of our evenings for us.

19:07.613 --> 19:11.310
Clark. Isn't Lana still going out
with Whitney?

19:11.784 --> 19:13.513
She's not married, Mom.

19:21.293 --> 19:25.525
<i>- Hello?
- Bella. Bella, it's me, Sean.</i>

19:25.698 --> 19:27.256
<i>What do you want?</i>

19:27.433 --> 19:30.493
Well, I thought we might get together,
do something?

19:30.669 --> 19:32.330
<i>Yeah, like that's gonna happen.</i>

19:32.638 --> 19:35.607
Come on, Bell,
we were good together once.

19:35.774 --> 19:38.607
Sure, I might have made some
mistakes, but, you know...

19:38.777 --> 19:41.473
<i>- Save it for some other girl.
- Bella.</i>

19:42.881 --> 19:44.143
Bella!

19:57.363 --> 19:58.887
Chloe.

19:59.765 --> 20:03.428
Your online horoscope suggests that
you try not to flaunt your excitement.

20:03.602 --> 20:07.834
Which will be hard, since you've waited
for this date since your first growth spurt.

20:08.007 --> 20:11.966
I'll say this once more, then I'll print up
bumper stickers. This isn't a date.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.975
All right. Just check Lana's outfit.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.979
If a girl wears something new,
she thinks it's a date.

20:17.149 --> 20:20.050
- I thought you came over for fashion advice?
- Burn that.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.880
What else have you got?

20:23.022 --> 20:25.047
I'll check the laundry basket.

20:31.330 --> 20:32.729
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, Chloe.</i>

20:32.898 --> 20:36.061
<i>- Sean, hi.
- Don't I owe you an apology?</i>

20:36.235 --> 20:40.638
- Guess who just called me. Sean.
- Did he apologize for blowing you off?

20:40.806 --> 20:42.740
He said he wasn't feeling well.

20:42.908 --> 20:46.674
Chloe, I saw him go off with Jenna.
Maybe she made him feel better.

20:46.845 --> 20:50.008
Well, he promised it was completely
over with her.

20:50.182 --> 20:51.979
You like him, don't you?

20:52.284 --> 20:55.742
He may be a little intellectually challenged,
but he's really hot.

20:55.921 --> 21:00.449
<i>He begged to get together, just to talk. I told
him he could bring me a coffee at the Torch.</i>

21:00.826 --> 21:03.090
- Sounds like a date.
- It's not a date.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.787
It's a fact-finding mission to see
if he deserves a date.

21:06.131 --> 21:08.190
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

21:08.367 --> 21:13.066
Don't worry. I figure if you can take
a risk with Lana, I can take a shot too.

21:14.907 --> 21:18.468
- Blue's a good color on you.
- Really?

21:26.752 --> 21:28.049
Welcome.

21:29.688 --> 21:32.179
I'm delighted you decided to come.

21:32.357 --> 21:34.188
- Your house is very-
- Large?

21:34.359 --> 21:35.758
To put it mildly.

21:35.928 --> 21:39.295
The word "restraint" doesn't exist
in my father's vocabulary.

21:39.465 --> 21:41.626
I'm sorry, are we early?

21:45.104 --> 21:46.731
I think we should go.

21:46.905 --> 21:51.399
- Wait, just because no one else came...
- That's if anyone else was even invited.

21:52.010 --> 21:56.037
- I don't think Lex would-
- Actually, I would. I did.

21:56.215 --> 21:59.241
But only because I knew you
wouldn't have come otherwise.

21:59.451 --> 22:03.319
I know your farm's in trouble,
Mr. Kent. Small town.

22:04.556 --> 22:07.719
So you thought you would take advantage
of my family's problem.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.927
No. I thought I could help.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.763
Well, then, I guess we're here to listen.

22:32.551 --> 22:35.145
I've never actually sat
in a limo before tonight.

22:35.320 --> 22:41.452
I did once. Nell got one to take us to
the ballet. But it wasn't as nice as this.

22:41.627 --> 22:44.187
Beats another night
of defensive reading.

22:45.797 --> 22:49.198
You've done it since we were kids.
Whenever the world gets disappointing...

22:49.368 --> 22:51.427
...you retreat into a book.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.440
There are worse things.

22:58.210 --> 23:03.876
No, you're right. It's just easier than dealing
with my own life, you know what I mean?

23:04.049 --> 23:06.108
I do the same thing with astronomy.

23:06.285 --> 23:10.051
I look at different worlds and wonder
if my life would be better there.

23:10.222 --> 23:13.521
You always seem to understand
what I'm trying to say.

23:13.692 --> 23:16.855
- How come you know so much?
- Magic.

23:17.262 --> 23:19.093
You don't believe in magic?

23:21.466 --> 23:22.831
I'll show you.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.064
Pick a card.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.707
All right.

23:42.854 --> 23:44.583
Three of hearts.

23:47.092 --> 23:49.219
Full of surprises.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.161
This is weird, huh?

24:00.839 --> 24:03.740
I felt like I had to explain
tonight to Nell.

24:03.909 --> 24:08.141
I spent the better part of the day
convincing people this was not a date.

24:09.848 --> 24:11.748
How about Whitney?

24:12.985 --> 24:15.977
- I didn't tell him.
- You feeling guilty about that?

24:16.822 --> 24:20.849
He's hanging out with his friends,
and I'm hanging out with mine.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.886
Exactly.

24:26.598 --> 24:31.626
<i>And in Smallville tonight, police
are seeking 17-year-old Sean Kelvin...</i>

24:31.803 --> 24:35.534
<i>...after the mysterious death of fellow
Smallville High student Jenna Barham...</i>

24:35.707 --> 24:38.073
<i>- ... whose body was found this afternoon.
- Oh, my God.</i>

24:38.243 --> 24:40.040
<i>- Kelvin was last seen...
- Stop the car!</i>

25:03.502 --> 25:07.666
Sean? Hello, is that you?

25:19.885 --> 25:22.285
Okay, this is interesting.

25:36.268 --> 25:38.361
- Clark, what's wrong?
- It's complicated.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.562
Hang out here for a while.
I want you to be safe.

25:40.739 --> 25:42.866
- Safe from what?
- I promise I'll explain.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.202
- Will you wait for me?
- Sure.

25:45.777 --> 25:49.269
I just want you to know that this is
the best non-date that I've ever had.

26:16.007 --> 26:17.338
Sean?

26:19.711 --> 26:22.976
What's going on?
I agreed to a cappuccino.

26:25.450 --> 26:29.113
If you think I'm skinny-dipping
with you, try again, buddy.

26:35.761 --> 26:39.697
I'm sorry, Chloe.
I don't have a choice.

26:40.665 --> 26:44.157
- What happened to you?
- I can't stay warm.

26:44.970 --> 26:48.872
- Well, why don't you just sit by a fire?
- Because I only get a quick fix.

26:49.641 --> 26:52.007
Body heat lasts longer.

27:18.737 --> 27:21.570
- No!
- I promise it won't hurt, Chloe.

27:28.847 --> 27:30.337
Clark!

27:31.917 --> 27:33.748
- Clark, help!
- Are you okay?

27:34.386 --> 27:35.910
My foot's stuck.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.088
You okay?

27:51.403 --> 27:53.030
Go! Run!

28:03.748 --> 28:06.740
- Did I thank you for that rescue yet?
- I heard about Jenna...

28:06.918 --> 28:08.977
...and I didn't want you to be next.

28:09.187 --> 28:13.283
Well, I finally find a guy I like,
and he turns out to be homicidal.

28:13.492 --> 28:17.292
You deserved a lot better than Sean
even before he tried to kill you.

28:17.496 --> 28:20.693
- That's sweet. I think.
- Any idea what happened to him?

28:21.166 --> 28:24.294
Only thing I can find is a medical condition
where there's damage...

28:24.469 --> 28:26.562
...to the thermosensitive cells
in the brain.

28:26.738 --> 28:31.198
The person literally can't stay warm.
It's like a permanent case of hypothermia.

28:31.376 --> 28:35.540
- Sean's getting heat where he can take it.
- Preferably from high-school girls.

28:35.714 --> 28:39.775
But, I mean, you saw the pool.
You take heat out of water, you get ice.

28:40.218 --> 28:43.654
He's like- He's like a battery
that can't hold its charge.

28:43.822 --> 28:46.222
- We should call for help.
- I'll take care of that.

28:46.391 --> 28:49.224
We need to get you home. Come on.

28:50.529 --> 28:54.021
You have to believe me when I say that
almost getting my heat sucked...

28:54.199 --> 28:57.430
...was not a passive-aggressive
attempt to ruin your date.

28:58.303 --> 28:59.565
Lana.

29:01.072 --> 29:03.768
- Let's sit right here.
- Okay.

29:05.777 --> 29:07.267
Thanks.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.506
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

29:14.553 --> 29:17.283
Shouldn't you be fifth-row center
right about now?

29:17.455 --> 29:20.049
- Hey, Pete.
- Where's Clark?

29:20.792 --> 29:25.889
I don't know. He saw that news report
about Jenna and suddenly had to run.

29:26.064 --> 29:29.864
I heard that too. I always thought
that Sean was a good guy.

29:30.035 --> 29:32.629
I guess we don't know people
as well as we think.

29:34.806 --> 29:37.741
You've been friends with Clark
for a long time.

29:37.909 --> 29:40.036
- Is he always so...?
- Clark-like?

29:41.079 --> 29:44.014
Sometimes he's totally there
and you think you know everything...

29:44.182 --> 29:47.117
- ... and then there's this part that's...
- Mysterious.

29:47.285 --> 29:52.188
Yeah, that's it. Clark Kent,
international man of mystery.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.458
Whatever it was seemed important.

29:54.626 --> 29:58.153
I can't believe there's anything
more important to him than you.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.121
Lana, what are you doing here?

30:03.034 --> 30:04.831
Just reading.

30:05.036 --> 30:07.869
Pretty dressed up to be digging
into a book.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.138
I'll catch up with you later.

30:11.910 --> 30:14.811
Pete, why don't you take
your date for a spin in the limo.

30:15.246 --> 30:19.546
- She's not a date. She's just my friend.
- Either way, I won't be needing it.

30:23.021 --> 30:24.386
Thanks.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.088
What were you doing in a limo?

30:31.262 --> 30:35.255
Just hanging out with a friend.
Could you take me home?

31:14.305 --> 31:16.466
This can't be happening.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.212
Sean.

31:36.995 --> 31:39.395
Guess the generator works.
Power must have blown.

31:39.564 --> 31:42.124
- Where were we?
- You were explaining how you could...

31:42.300 --> 31:44.962
- ... single-handedly save the family farm.
- Jonathan.

31:45.136 --> 31:48.663
It's okay, Mrs. Kent, I understand
your husband's skepticism.

31:49.140 --> 31:51.608
Your farm's drowning in debt,
we both know it.

31:51.776 --> 31:54.745
I'm trying to offer you a hand,
but you keep slapping it away.

31:55.146 --> 31:58.081
I learned a long time ago
from a man much smarter than myself...

31:58.249 --> 32:02.549
- ... that you need to solve your own problems.
- Your father lived in different times.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.780
And he had his share of help.

32:05.757 --> 32:09.853
Seems government subsidies carried
him through a number of lean years.

32:15.734 --> 32:18.202
- Where did you get these?
- It's public record.

32:20.605 --> 32:24.302
I'm making a business offer.
I had to do my due diligence.

32:24.476 --> 32:27.274
Why are you so interested
in our family, Lex?

32:27.445 --> 32:31.347
Your son brought me back
from the dead, Mr. Kent.

32:31.750 --> 32:35.413
When he reached in and pulled me out,
he gave me a new life.

32:37.655 --> 32:41.489
Your father put his family's future
over his own pride.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.186
Are you willing to do that?

33:01.012 --> 33:05.039
I know this is probably one of those
times I should just let things go...

33:05.216 --> 33:08.083
...but I'd kind of like to know
what's going on.

33:08.520 --> 33:13.583
You went out with your friends, I went out
with Clark. He invited me to a concert.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.357
So you two were just hanging out.

33:16.528 --> 33:19.929
- Right.
- Was this a test to see what I'd do?

33:20.932 --> 33:23.901
- Why didn't you just tell me?
- I knew you'd overreact.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.797
You go on a date with another guy,
and I'm overreacting.

33:26.971 --> 33:30.031
It wasn't a date.
Clark's a friend, that's it.

33:30.208 --> 33:31.971
- Whitney, look out!
- Sean!

33:32.744 --> 33:34.177
Hold on!

34:02.273 --> 34:06.004
- Lana, are you okay?
- My ankle hurts. I think I twisted it.

34:07.178 --> 34:08.907
- Where did Sean go?
- I don't know.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.775
But I've gotta get you somewhere safe.
Hold on.

34:16.254 --> 34:17.551
Come on.

34:20.024 --> 34:21.650
- You all right?
- Yeah.

34:21.826 --> 34:27.196
Come on. Those lights are over at the
Luthor house, just down the road. Come on.

34:27.632 --> 34:30.658
So you would give us the latest
farming equipment and technology.

34:30.835 --> 34:32.928
All in exchange for our independence.

34:33.103 --> 34:37.335
My influence will be minimal but
existing, yes. It's a partnership.

34:37.675 --> 34:40.268
- We could get a loan.
- Or you can allow me...

34:40.445 --> 34:44.074
...to help you get to the point where you
never need someone like me again.

34:44.482 --> 34:48.077
- I'll admit, it looks generous.
- It is.

34:48.253 --> 34:51.916
Which begs the question, what does
Lex Luthor get out of all of this?

34:52.223 --> 34:56.353
I believe there's profit to be made.
I'm not exactly in the charity business.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.620
Like father like son.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.795
Take some time to think about it.

35:00.965 --> 35:05.265
I'm sure you'll see the benefits outweigh
your other options. To the future.

35:09.207 --> 35:11.505
- Lana.
- She's okay.

35:13.711 --> 35:15.303
Where's Clark?

35:46.177 --> 35:48.543
Thanks for the warm-up, Clark.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.963
This kid sounds dangerous.
I've got the gate down and the alarm on.

36:16.407 --> 36:20.366
You're staying here until they find Sean.
Sorry about your date.

36:25.450 --> 36:28.476
No. I'm still getting
the answering machine at home.

36:28.653 --> 36:33.647
- Remind me I don't have to worry.
- He's Clark, Martha.

37:08.126 --> 37:10.219
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

37:10.395 --> 37:13.091
- I'll go check the front gate.
- It should be secure.

37:13.264 --> 37:17.462
- I'll check the generator. Where is it?
- On the side of the house, but I can get it.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.309
Hello.

37:37.555 --> 37:40.524
- Are you Sean?
- Yes, ma'am.

37:42.126 --> 37:44.492
- What do you want?
- Who, me?

37:45.229 --> 37:46.719
I just wanna get warm.

37:46.898 --> 37:48.923
- Get away from her, Sean.
- Clark.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.727
Go in the house, Mom.

37:51.302 --> 37:54.328
- Go now.
- That's your mom?

37:55.807 --> 37:58.833
- She's hot.
- Sean, you have to get to a hospital.

37:59.143 --> 38:02.943
What are they gonna do?
Put me under an electric blanket?

38:03.114 --> 38:07.414
I need heat, Clark. Contact. That's the
only thing that's gonna work for me.

38:07.685 --> 38:11.121
- Every person's another fix.
- You're not getting into that house.

38:11.556 --> 38:14.525
Who's gonna stop me? You?

38:44.589 --> 38:49.117
I don't know what it is about you, Clark,
but I haven't felt this good in two days.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.989
And when I'm done with you,
there's your mom...

38:52.530 --> 38:57.490
- ... your dad and Lana.
- I'll never let you hurt them.

39:33.404 --> 39:34.701
Good morning.

39:36.140 --> 39:39.200
- I heard you took out a bank loan today.
- Did you?

39:39.710 --> 39:43.669
After our conversation the other night,
I was frankly surprised.

39:43.848 --> 39:46.078
Do you despise me that much?

39:47.251 --> 39:49.082
Believe it or not, Lex...

39:50.087 --> 39:53.318
...some things actually
have nothing to do with you.

39:53.791 --> 39:56.282
I decided to bet on my family.

39:57.094 --> 39:59.221
You're betting with Clark's future.

39:59.397 --> 40:01.661
- I'm just trying to insure it.
- Yeah, so am I.

40:01.832 --> 40:03.094
With the bank?

40:03.267 --> 40:06.464
They'll kill you with interest
while waiting for you to fail.

40:06.904 --> 40:10.305
At least with the bank,
I know where I stand.

40:11.142 --> 40:14.976
I know you don't believe me,
but I genuinely want to help you.

40:16.080 --> 40:18.981
When you change your mind,
my offer still stands.

40:40.204 --> 40:41.569
You okay?

40:42.773 --> 40:46.140
Yeah. The memorial service is tomorrow.

40:51.616 --> 40:54.050
I was thinking how that
could have been me.

40:55.119 --> 40:59.055
All because some guy expressed
a modicum of interest in me.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.855
I thought I was stronger than that.

41:04.462 --> 41:08.489
Everybody's searching for their soul mate.
It's not a sign of weakness.

41:09.567 --> 41:13.594
I can't believe both your dates went straight
to hell, and I ended up with the limo.

41:13.771 --> 41:15.602
- How was that?
- It was sweet.

41:15.773 --> 41:17.968
I've already hooked up
with another date.

41:18.142 --> 41:21.111
- I'm swearing off men.
- They're not all bad.

41:21.279 --> 41:24.578
Maybe you should just swear off
heat-sucking horn dogs.

41:24.815 --> 41:29.980
Yeah, the next time a guy asks me out,
I'm doing an in-depth background check.

41:32.923 --> 41:35.483
Come on, Pete.
Clark will catch up with us later.

41:43.067 --> 41:44.398
Lana.

41:45.703 --> 41:48.729
- Hey, how's your ankle?
- It's better, thanks.

41:52.209 --> 41:54.473
You never came back the other night.

41:55.112 --> 41:57.808
I did, but you were gone.

42:00.418 --> 42:03.819
I'm sorry. I wanted things
to work out differently.

42:04.622 --> 42:06.146
Don't worry about it.

42:06.490 --> 42:12.292
I was thinking maybe we could try
again sometime. How about Saturday?

42:12.830 --> 42:16.857
Whitney's taking me to the city.
He's got the whole day planned.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.502
I think our non-date freaked him out.

42:21.005 --> 42:24.372
- What'd you tell him?
- The truth.

42:25.009 --> 42:26.670
That we're just friends.

42:30.748 --> 42:32.511
I have to go.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.484
Lana.

42:38.689 --> 42:42.056
Why do you go out with him?
Whitney, I mean.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.961
Because whenever I need him,
he's there.

42:46.464 --> 42:48.455
Guess he makes me feel safe.

42:49.305 --> 42:55.429
