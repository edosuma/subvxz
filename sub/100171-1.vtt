00:29.647 --> 00:32.584
[bell tolling]

00:53.270 --> 00:56.006
[tolling continues]

01:02.246 --> 01:06.083
[reverend] "But if you do
wrong, be afraid,

01:06.216 --> 01:09.821
for he does not bear the sword
in vain.

01:09.954 --> 01:13.625
He is the servant of God,

01:13.758 --> 01:18.061
an avenger who carries out
God's wrath

01:18.195 --> 01:20.565
on the wrongful."

01:22.967 --> 01:25.837
I often thought of my friend,

01:26.905 --> 01:29.774
Officer Reginald Dean Davis,

01:30.475 --> 01:33.611
when I would read Romans 13:4.

01:34.646 --> 01:37.080
That he punished two of the
three men who attacked him

01:37.214 --> 01:40.250
before he himself was killed

01:40.384 --> 01:44.154
means I will never think of
anyone else ever again

01:44.722 --> 01:49.661
when I read or speak this verse.

01:51.029 --> 01:53.531
He died protecting his family,

01:53.665 --> 01:57.769
his friends and this city.

01:57.902 --> 02:02.574
He was a servant of God.

02:03.708 --> 02:08.545
I assuage my rage
that a third man escaped

02:09.279 --> 02:11.716
by trying to remind myself
of a few things.

02:13.818 --> 02:15.420
First,

02:15.553 --> 02:18.590
Reginald found a woman

02:19.189 --> 02:22.594
as strong, driven
and smart as he.

02:25.162 --> 02:27.397
And then I think of his boy,

02:29.000 --> 02:30.501
Andre,

02:31.603 --> 02:36.340
and I see the same,
sometimes infuriating,

02:36.474 --> 02:38.610
fearlessness,

02:38.743 --> 02:40.511
inquisitiveness.

02:45.550 --> 02:48.786
I know it may not
feel like it now,

02:50.120 --> 02:55.192
but you got more from your
father, Andre, in 13 years

02:55.325 --> 02:57.829
than most men will
in a lifetime.

02:57.962 --> 03:00.898
He taught you to follow
your conscience,

03:01.032 --> 03:05.302
to not take anyone else's word
about what is right and wrong,

03:06.638 --> 03:09.674
to find a just code

03:09.807 --> 03:13.310
in an often cruel world.

03:13.444 --> 03:16.481
[siren blaring]

03:23.021 --> 03:26.491
[man 1] Thank you for making time
for IA at the end of your shift.

03:26.624 --> 03:28.258
[Andre] I didn't have a choice.

03:29.727 --> 03:31.395
[man 1] You could choose
not to be a cop.

03:32.430 --> 03:34.732
Being a cop
isn't a choice for me.

03:35.165 --> 03:36.501
[man 1] What is it, then?

03:36.634 --> 03:38.002
DNA.

03:38.136 --> 03:39.713
[woman] At this point,
we don't need to spell out

03:39.737 --> 03:40.737
why we're all here.

03:40.805 --> 03:43.908
Yes, we do. Official procedure.

03:44.042 --> 03:46.878
Any officer who discharges his
or her weapon in the line of duty

03:47.011 --> 03:48.980
must justify
every round of ammunition.

03:49.113 --> 03:51.314
[man 2] You've shot
eight people in nine years.

03:51.449 --> 03:53.918
Good shootings. Cleared on all.

03:54.052 --> 03:55.853
[man 2] Three since you
were made detective.

03:55.987 --> 03:57.387
Four now.

03:57.522 --> 03:59.522
The one who survived
was sentenced to life without.

04:00.658 --> 04:02.527
Do you regret any?

04:03.161 --> 04:04.962
I've been to the psychologist.

04:05.096 --> 04:06.097
That's not an answer.

04:06.229 --> 04:07.832
No, I do not regret any.

04:07.965 --> 04:10.501
Faces don't come to you
in your sleep?

04:11.969 --> 04:13.938
Justice comes at a cost.

04:14.072 --> 04:16.040
Justice is not determined
by you.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.442
But I am the sharp end
of that determination.

04:18.576 --> 04:19.576
Says who?

04:19.677 --> 04:21.012
My badge.

04:21.579 --> 04:22.613
My oath.

04:22.747 --> 04:24.082
Your DNA?

04:33.256 --> 04:35.292
During the Civil War,

04:35.993 --> 04:39.731
some soldiers just kept loading
their muskets without ever firing.

04:40.297 --> 04:43.233
Five or six balls
loaded on top of each other.

04:43.366 --> 04:47.205
In Vietnam, only 30% of frontline
infantry soldiers ever fired a shot.

04:47.337 --> 04:51.109
So, ten soldiers in battle,
only three truly fighting.

04:51.241 --> 04:54.178
Are you really using war analogies
here, Detective Davis?

04:54.311 --> 04:56.379
What do you imagine
the other seven were doing?

04:56.514 --> 05:00.785
[train wheels screeching]

05:23.775 --> 05:24.775
Hi, Andre.

05:24.876 --> 05:26.244
How's she doing?

05:26.376 --> 05:29.379
Tired, but I just
gave her her meds.

05:29.514 --> 05:31.616
All right, you can head home.
I got this.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.151
Okay.

05:33.283 --> 05:35.086
You know where to find me
if you need me.

05:39.657 --> 05:41.259
What are we watching?

05:45.596 --> 05:47.465
You left me.

05:48.132 --> 05:51.002
No, Ma. I had to pull a triple.

05:53.771 --> 05:56.174
I've been here too long.

05:56.306 --> 05:57.306
I've...

05:57.408 --> 05:59.309
I've overstayed my welcome.

05:59.443 --> 06:02.880
Nah. You can never overstay
your welcome.

06:03.915 --> 06:05.750
You're here to take me home.

06:08.085 --> 06:09.587
This is home.

06:10.154 --> 06:12.156
Don't leave me here, Reginald.

06:12.723 --> 06:13.791
Ma...

06:16.393 --> 06:18.029
it's Andre.

06:21.299 --> 06:22.332
It's Dre, Mama.

06:24.402 --> 06:27.071
I need to take my meds.

06:27.205 --> 06:29.040
No, no, no. You took them.

06:29.173 --> 06:30.808
You already took them.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.546
You look tired.

06:36.681 --> 06:38.348
You work too hard.

06:38.482 --> 06:40.518
Yeah, you got that right.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.855
It's the job.

06:43.988 --> 06:45.723
It's what I do.

06:45.857 --> 06:47.357
I know.

06:48.125 --> 06:50.595
You gotta look the devil
in the eye.

06:56.968 --> 06:58.236
Yeah.

07:01.405 --> 07:02.840
Yeah, Ma.

07:03.674 --> 07:04.709
[kisses]

07:06.944 --> 07:09.080
[police radio chatter]

07:29.533 --> 07:31.736
[radio chatter continues]

07:46.317 --> 07:48.386
[radio chatter ends]

08:34.899 --> 08:36.534
[dog barking]

08:38.235 --> 08:39.570
[exhales]

08:40.236 --> 08:42.273
Well, it looks just like
you said it would.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.030
Hey, does yours smell
like your beard?

09:07.698 --> 09:09.233
It smells like your girl.

09:10.301 --> 09:11.969
[both laugh]

09:14.372 --> 09:15.539
[exhales]

09:16.307 --> 09:17.341
Let's go.

09:24.148 --> 09:26.183
[keypad beeping]

09:26.817 --> 09:28.052
[door buzzes]

09:54.578 --> 09:56.814
[bottles clanking]

10:04.855 --> 10:06.323
Who the fuck are you guys?

10:06.458 --> 10:08.301
[man 1] We're the guys
that are taking your cocaine.

10:08.325 --> 10:11.295
Not smart. You guys
are gonna fucking die.

10:11.430 --> 10:12.430
[grunts]

10:14.131 --> 10:15.166

10:19.336 --> 10:20.604
[man 2] Where is it?

10:22.173 --> 10:24.942
[panting] Freezer. Downstairs.

10:25.076 --> 10:26.445
[man 1] We need a key?

10:37.489 --> 10:39.491
[breathing heavily]

10:42.393 --> 10:43.928
Just two of you?

10:49.300 --> 10:50.968
You're gonna be here all night.

10:54.539 --> 10:55.806
[man 2] Yo!

11:01.011 --> 11:02.113
[man 1] Move!

11:09.386 --> 11:11.155
That's not 30 keys.

11:12.223 --> 11:13.624
[manager] It's 300.

11:15.560 --> 11:16.760
Somebody fucked up.

11:16.894 --> 11:18.597
[man 2] Shut up. On your knees.

11:19.564 --> 11:20.931
Jeez.

11:21.398 --> 11:22.434
[knife scrapes]

11:32.776 --> 11:33.954
This stuff hasn't been cut yet.

11:33.978 --> 11:36.548
Jackpot! Fuck yeah!

11:37.781 --> 11:38.816
[man 1] No way. We walk.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.818
- [man 2] What?
- We walk.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.786
Small ain't always smart.

11:47.892 --> 11:49.693
You can help or you can watch.

11:49.827 --> 11:50.828
This is fucking stupid.

11:52.597 --> 11:54.499
This is fucking freedom.

12:17.188 --> 12:19.524
[police officers chattering]

12:22.826 --> 12:23.994

Shh.

12:27.499 --> 12:28.819
[officer]
The fuck is this guy at?

12:29.133 --> 12:31.035
He might be by the back door.
Check it out.

We don't want any more blood!

You don't have to kill him.

It's Andre, right?

18:54.919 --> 18:56.119
Yes, sir.

18:56.988 --> 18:59.757
I never met your dad,

You're sitting
in my crime scene.

I heard you were with IA today.

19:32.490 --> 19:35.125
And I'd fucking love it if you
were right back there tomorrow.

19:38.796 --> 19:39.998
If they give me cause.

19:40.130 --> 19:41.231
Cause?

19:43.434 --> 19:45.436
Here's your fucking cause
right there. Okay?

19:45.570 --> 19:47.805
- You understand what I'm saying?
- Give me the room.

19:47.939 --> 19:50.975
Your fucking cause times seven
lying dead in the fucking street.

all the reason you need...

Mac! You're not the only one
hurting here.

19:55.947 --> 19:57.415
You're in public.

when a cop goes down.

[chief] Lower your voice.

20:01.251 --> 20:02.520
What were their names?

Uh, yeah.

is Marcus Fernandez.

What?

20:33.051 --> 20:34.251
Marcus Fernandez.

20:34.384 --> 20:35.687
I knew Marcus.

20:36.788 --> 20:38.690
We were at the academy together.

Out there with Marcus...

20:43.027 --> 20:46.764
is Reuben Kizer
and Patrick Graham.

they leave behind four wives,

20:53.004 --> 20:54.672
one fiancée,

20:56.507 --> 20:57.842
six kids.

20:58.976 --> 21:00.812
Three are my godkids.

21:01.646 --> 21:04.048
Now I'm gonna go wake them up
in the middle of the night,

21:04.182 --> 21:07.418
let them know
their lives are shattered.

21:08.753 --> 21:10.188
You know the drill.

21:14.291 --> 21:17.260
Look, I fucking refuse

21:17.394 --> 21:19.597
to allow these families
to be traumatized even more

21:19.731 --> 21:23.468
with fucking trials and appeals
and horseshit narratives,

21:23.601 --> 21:26.838
parole hearings for, fuck,
three, four decades.

21:32.043 --> 21:33.811
I'm asking you...

21:35.446 --> 21:37.215
to protect them from that.

21:39.349 --> 21:40.718
I understand.

21:44.254 --> 21:45.288
Why were they here?

21:46.824 --> 21:48.860
My guys interrupted a robbery.

21:50.561 --> 21:51.561
[police radio chatter]

21:51.629 --> 21:53.131
How much cocaine is this?

21:53.263 --> 21:55.433
[McKenna] Crime Scene
estimates about 300 kilos

21:55.566 --> 21:56.868
before the scumbags cut into it.

21:57.001 --> 21:58.536
How much did they take?

21:58.669 --> 22:00.037
About 50 keys.

22:00.171 --> 22:01.572
[woman]
One hundred and ten pounds.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.976
That's A1 weight.
You're looking at 25 years.

22:05.109 --> 22:06.778
Ninety-plus percent pure.

22:06.911 --> 22:08.980
Two million, plus or minus,
before you step on it.

22:09.113 --> 22:10.982
It's quadruple after.

22:11.115 --> 22:14.317
Detective Andre Davis,
Detective Frankie Burns, DETF.

22:14.452 --> 22:16.721
- She'll be working with you.
- With me doing what?

22:16.854 --> 22:19.223
This is the biggest coke seizure
in I don't know how long.

22:19.356 --> 22:22.193
- Narcotics will be involved.
- I appreciate the politics.

22:22.325 --> 22:25.139
But if I don't catch these guys in the
next three or four hours, they vanish.

22:25.163 --> 22:27.031
I don't do fucking politics.

22:27.165 --> 22:29.000
And she's not the second team.

22:29.133 --> 22:30.768
You can either fight me
or use me.

22:33.471 --> 22:35.773
[dog barking]

22:45.416 --> 22:47.485
[vomits]

22:48.219 --> 22:49.821
[coughing]

22:59.730 --> 23:00.998
You good?

23:01.132 --> 23:02.867
We should
fucking kill ourselves.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.502
Don't be like that. Not now.

23:04.635 --> 23:07.205
We just killed more cops
than I can fucking count, Ray.

23:07.337 --> 23:08.673
I did all the killing.

23:08.806 --> 23:10.875
You think they give a shit
about the body math?

23:11.008 --> 23:12.743
They're gonna figure us out.

23:12.877 --> 23:15.378
It was dark. We moved fast.
Car's not ours. Plates are stolen.

23:15.513 --> 23:18.015
It'll get solved, Ray.
All right?

23:18.149 --> 23:20.451
We both hate the fucking cops,
but they're smart.

23:20.585 --> 23:23.187
They're gonna figure out our
names by sunrise. We need to run.

23:23.321 --> 23:25.355
We need a plan. We need money.

23:26.457 --> 23:27.692
Fuck!

23:30.928 --> 23:32.330
Employee?

23:32.463 --> 23:34.131
Yeah. Came up whistle-clean.

23:34.265 --> 23:37.201
No-scroll good citizen
named Tom Cheaver.

23:37.335 --> 23:39.503
So, Tom took his bullet
from just a few feet.

23:39.637 --> 23:41.939
Notice the stippling
around the entrance wound.

23:42.073 --> 23:44.075
And judging from
the proximity of that knife,

23:44.208 --> 23:45.977
Tom tried to make a move.

23:46.544 --> 23:47.845
Over here,

23:47.979 --> 23:48.980
double taps.

23:49.113 --> 23:51.148
Automatic weapon, suppressed.

23:51.282 --> 23:52.483
I say two shooters.

23:52.617 --> 23:54.018
Where are you seeing that?

23:54.151 --> 23:56.029
No one's smooth enough
to murder all these officers

23:56.053 --> 23:58.589
and hit Tom
coming up with a knife.

23:58.723 --> 24:02.193
And one guy probably isn't carrying
100-plus pounds of cocaine out by himself.

24:02.326 --> 24:03.928
Yeah, but it could be
more than two.

24:04.061 --> 24:06.731
Nah. Look at
the shell groupings.

24:06.864 --> 24:08.432
One was back there. He hit Tom.

24:08.566 --> 24:11.302
The second one came this way.

24:14.038 --> 24:16.140
Then he murdered all four of us.

24:17.642 --> 24:18.843
Yeah.

24:18.976 --> 24:20.845
Second one's a talented killer.

24:32.290 --> 24:34.058
You left a zero off,
motherfucker.

24:34.592 --> 24:35.592
What?

24:35.693 --> 24:36.837
That wasn't 30 keys stepped on.

24:36.861 --> 24:38.462
It was 300 pure.

24:38.596 --> 24:39.630
Wasn't my fuckup.

24:39.764 --> 24:41.132
Whose fuckup was it?

24:41.265 --> 24:43.267
Hawk Tyler's, maybe?
He put the job out for bid.

24:43.402 --> 24:45.236
But you guys
got something, right?

24:46.405 --> 24:48.005
- Fifty keys.
- Well, good.

24:48.139 --> 24:50.374
- Fuck you!
- I'm changing the deal.

24:51.008 --> 24:52.777
You're not selling it for us
anymore.

24:52.910 --> 24:55.470
You're gonna bring us to Hawk,
and we're gonna sell it ourselves.

24:55.513 --> 24:56.790
And we're not splitting it
three ways.

24:56.814 --> 24:58.649
I owe a lot of money
to a lot of people...

24:58.783 --> 25:01.485
Me and Ray have to run for
the rest of our fucking lives!

25:02.386 --> 25:03.988
[man] Hawk ain't gonna hear
new deals.

25:04.121 --> 25:06.757
Yeah, well, Hawk
hasn't heard 50 pure yet.

25:08.626 --> 25:09.660
Give me your phone.

25:23.541 --> 25:24.541
[man] Hit.

25:25.142 --> 25:26.610
We got a hit!

25:29.613 --> 25:30.613
It's a red light cam.

25:30.681 --> 25:31.983
Two men.

25:32.516 --> 25:35.353
Alert everybody. Send it through
the mobile unit at Mosto's.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.155
Detective Davis.

25:38.289 --> 25:40.858
Sergeant Yolanda Bell,
shift supervisor at LMSI.

25:40.992 --> 25:42.893
Good to know you, Yolanda Bell.

25:43.027 --> 25:45.029
[Yolanda]
<i>We got something for you.</i>

25:56.607 --> 26:00.311
How much you wanna bet when we find
that BMW, it's burnt to the chassis?

26:01.278 --> 26:02.313
A nickel.

26:08.487 --> 26:10.888
If you were gonna rob
660 pounds of coke,

26:11.022 --> 26:13.492
would you drive a BMW two-door
to the job?

26:13.624 --> 26:15.494
Would you bring
just one other guy with you?

26:15.626 --> 26:18.195
Would you only take 50 keys?

26:19.296 --> 26:21.732
No, no, and no.

26:22.967 --> 26:24.568
They weren't expecting 300.

26:24.702 --> 26:26.505
They weren't expecting cops,
either.

26:28.672 --> 26:30.541
This was either dumb luck...

26:32.076 --> 26:33.210
or a setup.

26:33.811 --> 26:35.112
[McKenna] No, fuck you!

26:35.246 --> 26:36.723
[FBI agent] The FBI's here
because the shooters

26:36.747 --> 26:37.867
are out of the state by now.

26:37.982 --> 26:39.302
Half hour
since the final whistle.

26:39.383 --> 26:40.761
Please, make one more
sports analogy.

26:40.785 --> 26:42.186
If and when we get confirmation

26:42.319 --> 26:44.197
that they crossed over
to Jersey or Connecticut...

26:44.221 --> 26:46.467
The mayor would prefer that the
FBI take over sooner than later.

26:46.491 --> 26:48.135
The mayor shits on us
every chance he gets.

26:48.159 --> 26:49.636
The fucking guy
eats pizza with a fork.

26:49.660 --> 26:50.961
He wants them
brought to justice.

26:51.095 --> 26:52.096
[McKenna] No shit.

26:54.698 --> 26:55.766
Dre.

26:55.900 --> 26:57.234
Toine.

26:57.368 --> 26:58.869
How'd it go
with Internal Affairs?

26:59.003 --> 27:00.571
I'm here,
so not the way you hoped.

27:01.205 --> 27:03.607
Like I said, the mayor
wants them brought to justice,

27:03.741 --> 27:05.976
i.e., arrested, arraigned,
put on trial.

27:06.110 --> 27:08.879
Not killed in a gun battle,
the details of which are foggy.

27:09.013 --> 27:10.614
Like the seven behind us?

27:11.382 --> 27:13.050
- [Antoine] Who are you?
- Narcotics.

27:13.184 --> 27:16.587
Beautiful. What could go wrong?
We got a narc and a trigger.

27:17.121 --> 27:19.890
You better have perfect
diction, calling me a "trigger."

27:20.024 --> 27:21.304
[chief] Cut the shit, everybody.

27:21.426 --> 27:22.960
Has the mayor
got his thumb on this?

27:23.094 --> 27:24.128
This an ask or an order?

27:25.296 --> 27:26.597
They're still in New York.

27:27.198 --> 27:29.568
You don't walk away
with 50 keys of 90% pure

27:29.700 --> 27:31.302
unless you have
a big local buyer.

27:31.436 --> 27:33.437
You don't move it far
unless you're into transport.

27:33.538 --> 27:34.978
These guys were hitters,
not drivers.

27:35.039 --> 27:36.039
You don't know that.

27:36.107 --> 27:37.842
Good enough to kill seven cops,

27:37.975 --> 27:39.310
dumb enough to run a red?

27:39.444 --> 27:41.612
What they need to do
is sell the coke, vanish.

27:41.745 --> 27:42.745
I'm not heading east.

27:42.847 --> 27:43.847
Long Island runs out,

27:43.881 --> 27:44.949
and it's all accountants

27:45.082 --> 27:46.123
and dentists out that way,

27:46.183 --> 27:47.918
so I'm a sore thumb.

27:48.052 --> 27:49.320
I'm not going to Queens.

27:49.454 --> 27:51.355
You don't wholesale coke
in the middle class.

27:51.490 --> 27:53.525
I'm not staying in Brooklyn,
scene of the crime.

27:53.657 --> 27:56.927
Plus, it's all pop-ups and
strollers and guys like you now.

27:57.061 --> 27:59.773
Anyone left on Staten Island who can move
this kind of weight as quick as they need?

27:59.797 --> 28:02.434
Not since the days before
Gotti murdered Castellano.

28:02.567 --> 28:03.567
What about Jersey?

28:03.634 --> 28:05.669
"Sopranos" was a TV show.

28:06.103 --> 28:08.172
And upstate?
That's fucking ridiculous.

28:08.305 --> 28:10.774
Ain't no way to move
50 keys of yayo in Utica.

28:10.908 --> 28:11.976
Leaves Manhattan.

28:12.109 --> 28:13.445
[officer] Detective Davis?

28:13.578 --> 28:14.745
What, you got a hit for me?

28:14.879 --> 28:15.746
[officer] 911 call.

28:15.880 --> 28:17.081
Black BMW, two-door,

28:17.214 --> 28:18.849
on fire
in an alley in Chinatown.

28:18.983 --> 28:20.851
Uh-oh, where's Chinatown?

28:20.985 --> 28:22.186
- Manhattan.
- [flicks coin]

28:22.319 --> 28:24.021
- [FBI agent] Feel good?
- It does.

28:24.155 --> 28:26.790
- How long ago was the 911?
- [officer] Ninety seconds.

28:26.924 --> 28:28.759
- Let's go.
- Wait, wait, wait.

28:28.893 --> 28:31.295
- For what?
- Everything about these guys,

28:31.429 --> 28:33.349
save the speed camera,
has been competent so far.

28:33.465 --> 28:35.275
- Yeah, so?
- They'll sell the coke, catch a train,

28:35.299 --> 28:36.800
catch a cab, jack a car,

28:36.934 --> 28:38.945
and we're right back to hoping
we get a hit from a cam

28:38.969 --> 28:41.238
before they vanish, show up
in Pennsylvania somewhere.

28:41.372 --> 28:43.608
Good point.
Whereas the FBI is national...

28:43.741 --> 28:44.975
Close the island.

28:45.577 --> 28:46.577
What island?

28:46.645 --> 28:47.845
Manhattan.

28:51.650 --> 28:52.926
[FBI agent]
You having a seizure?

28:52.950 --> 28:54.318
No, the mayor will buy it.

28:54.452 --> 28:56.387
He's in the low 30s,
crime is ticking up,

28:56.521 --> 28:58.623
homeless are pissing
in front of Tiffany's again,

28:58.756 --> 29:01.225
and it's 1:00 a.m.,
not 1:00 p.m.

29:01.358 --> 29:02.839
Anything goes wrong,
you can blame us.

29:02.960 --> 29:05.001
Something will go wrong,
and then you're all fucked.

29:05.062 --> 29:08.832
We get the concept of sacrifice is
like quantum physics to a fucking fed.

29:08.966 --> 29:11.479
The mayor can say he was listening
to his commanders in the field.

29:11.503 --> 29:12.903
Now, if your boss had a chance

29:13.037 --> 29:15.973
to catch the murderers
of seven New York City cops

29:16.106 --> 29:19.710
and chose not to, this city
would never forgive him.

29:25.316 --> 29:26.350
Catch them by 5:00.

29:27.017 --> 29:28.219
Wait, is that a yes or a no?

29:28.352 --> 29:30.522
Catch them by 5:00.

29:31.121 --> 29:32.923
[FBI agent] You all got balls,

29:33.057 --> 29:34.693
not a lot of brains.

29:36.060 --> 29:37.529
Good luck to you.

29:37.662 --> 29:39.096
We'll be awaiting
your phone call.

29:39.230 --> 29:40.731
Yeah, hold your breath.

29:43.901 --> 29:45.437
How you gonna do this?

29:47.972 --> 29:51.543
There are 21 bridges in and out
of Manhattan. Shut them down.

30:02.186 --> 30:05.389
Three rivers, close them.
Four tunnels, block them.

30:08.359 --> 30:10.160
[sirens blaring]

30:11.195 --> 30:14.107
Stop every train that leaves the island.
Amtrak, PATH, New Jersey Transit,

30:14.131 --> 30:18.102
LIRR, Metro-North,
and loop the subways.

30:18.235 --> 30:19.235
Then...

30:20.237 --> 30:22.707
we flood the island with blue.

30:27.445 --> 30:28.946
[sirens blaring]

31:01.979 --> 31:03.981
[police radio chatter]

31:05.750 --> 31:07.851
[sizzling]

31:11.790 --> 31:15.460
[Andre] You wanna ditch a car,
you drive five blocks, not to Manhattan.

31:15.593 --> 31:17.696
[Burns] Two sets of tire tracks.

31:17.861 --> 31:19.464
[Andre]
This was a meet-and-greet.

31:22.767 --> 31:24.168
Miss Yolanda.

31:24.835 --> 31:28.372
Hey, I need pictures of every car that
went into the alley after the BMW.

31:28.506 --> 31:31.141
[Yolanda] <i>There aren't any cameras
aimed right at the entrances.</i>

31:31.275 --> 31:34.446
Alley backs up into massage
parlors and Chinese restaurants.

31:34.579 --> 31:38.148
It's illegal workers. Every time a
camera goes up, it gets pulled back down.

31:38.282 --> 31:40.594
[Andre] Can you pick up every
passing vehicle on either end?

31:40.618 --> 31:41.852
[Yolanda] <i>What interval?</i>

31:41.985 --> 31:43.196
From the time the BMW
went into the alley

31:43.220 --> 31:45.457
to the first fire call to 911.

31:46.023 --> 31:47.425
Will do. Stand by.

31:50.495 --> 31:52.329
Are you who they say you are?

31:55.433 --> 31:57.167
Who do they say I am?

31:57.702 --> 31:59.036
You tell me.

31:59.169 --> 32:01.740
You killed a lot of perps
in the last ten years.

32:04.141 --> 32:05.710
Never shot first.

32:06.511 --> 32:07.612
Never?

32:08.780 --> 32:11.750
All right, let me be
more precise, Detective Burns.

32:11.882 --> 32:14.586
I've never fired
without just cause.

32:14.719 --> 32:18.790
Seven dead cops feels like
a lot of just cause.

32:20.958 --> 32:23.160
These guys are killers.

32:23.862 --> 32:27.030
So I need to know that we got
each other's backs tonight.

32:27.164 --> 32:29.401
'Cause I got a kid at home.

32:29.534 --> 32:31.403
Doesn't need to wake up
without her mother.

32:31.536 --> 32:33.705
You wear that badge,
I got your back.

32:33.838 --> 32:35.139
[phone rings]

32:36.073 --> 32:37.409
Talk to me.

32:40.645 --> 32:41.846
All right.

32:41.979 --> 32:43.748
- [Burns] Where we going?
- Uptown.

32:52.356 --> 32:55.693
[man on TV] <i>...has closed all
access into and out of Manhattan.</i>

32:55.827 --> 32:58.863
<i>In a statement from city hall,
the mayor's office was only able to offer</i>

32:58.996 --> 33:01.633
<i>a vague description
of the two suspects.</i>

33:01.766 --> 33:05.437
<i>They tell us both are men.
One is white, one is black.</i>

33:05.570 --> 33:08.773
<i>They are known to be armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

33:08.907 --> 33:12.276
<i>Deputy Mayor Antoine Mott defends
the decision to lock down the city.</i>

33:12.410 --> 33:15.747
<i>His statement says, "With no way off
the island for these two fugitives,</i>

33:15.880 --> 33:17.615
<i>the NYPD has every available...</i>

33:17.749 --> 33:20.150
- Nice.
- <i>...officer scouring Manhattan.</i>"

33:20.284 --> 33:22.119
How much have you got?

33:22.252 --> 33:23.621
Fifty kilos.

33:28.258 --> 33:30.929
<i>..."until this manhunt
is successfully completed."</i>

33:34.331 --> 33:36.200
- What up, B?
- [buyer] What up?

33:36.333 --> 33:37.936
This ain't usual and customary.

33:38.068 --> 33:39.804
Nothing is tonight, man.

33:39.938 --> 33:40.971
[both snap]

33:41.305 --> 33:43.340
This is Ray Jackson.

33:43.775 --> 33:44.943
And this is Michael...

33:45.075 --> 33:47.110
The bid you put out
was for 30 keys.

33:47.244 --> 33:48.312
We walked in on 300.

33:48.446 --> 33:50.113
Sometimes lightning strikes,
right?

33:50.247 --> 33:52.349
And even better when you're
a borough away from it.

33:52.484 --> 33:53.952
[Hawk] Yeah, most definitely.

33:54.084 --> 33:56.119
Look, we killed cops,
and now we gotta run forever.

33:56.253 --> 34:00.023
Then get on with your negotiations
and fuck your little guilt trip, word?

34:00.492 --> 34:02.292
I'm a drug dealer
who hit a rival drug dealer,

34:02.359 --> 34:04.294
and you're the guns
I got to do it.

34:04.762 --> 34:07.297
You think I fucked you because
someone somewhere forgot a zero?

34:08.867 --> 34:11.835
Our business doesn't attract a lot
of detail-oriented motherfuckers.

34:11.969 --> 34:14.839
You don't like it,
make your own moves.

34:14.973 --> 34:17.174
Or go drive an Uber.
Either way, let's make this deal

34:17.306 --> 34:19.347
so I can get you America's
Most Wanted motherfuckers

34:19.444 --> 34:21.478
out of my crib fast as I can.

34:26.216 --> 34:27.216
One million.

34:27.317 --> 34:28.318
[laughs]

34:28.953 --> 34:31.422
Pesos? [chuckles]

34:31.556 --> 34:35.527
Yo! I love it when fools strike gold
but don't know the market price.

34:35.659 --> 34:37.896
Fifty keys cuts into 200.

34:38.027 --> 34:40.965
Going rate for a cut key
in Manhattan is 32 G's.

34:41.098 --> 34:42.634
That means
after a million to us,

34:42.766 --> 34:45.135
that's still 5.4 million
for you.

34:45.637 --> 34:48.606
He's one of those
detail-oriented motherfuckers.

35:05.355 --> 35:07.190
[officer] Police!
Don't move! Search warrant!

35:07.792 --> 35:09.027
To the left!

35:12.964 --> 35:14.097
Police! Show me your hands!

35:14.231 --> 35:15.232
Turn around!

35:15.365 --> 35:16.366
[man] Hey, come on.

35:17.367 --> 35:19.169
[woman] What's going on?

35:19.303 --> 35:22.407
Get off of him!
No, he didn't do anything!

35:22.540 --> 35:23.540
He can't breathe!

35:23.608 --> 35:24.776
You know if you kill him,

35:24.909 --> 35:26.310
he can't tell us anything?

35:27.344 --> 35:29.414
- Stand up. Step over here.
- Okay.

35:30.582 --> 35:32.550
What's going on?
Is this you?

35:33.083 --> 35:35.553
- No, that is not my car.
- It's registered in your name.

35:35.687 --> 35:38.456
My ex-boyfriend, he had terrible
credit, so I put it in my name.

35:38.590 --> 35:39.624
He said he sold it!

35:39.757 --> 35:40.968
- He lied.
- [woman] All the time.

35:40.992 --> 35:42.359
You beat up the wrong man!

35:42.493 --> 35:43.493
He'll live.

35:43.561 --> 35:44.562
Get him out of here.

35:44.696 --> 35:46.064
Let's go.

35:46.196 --> 35:47.932
Hey. You okay?

35:48.066 --> 35:49.366
[Andre] Turn around.

35:51.436 --> 35:52.470
[woman] Oh, God.

35:53.938 --> 35:55.298
[Burns]
Knock it off. Knock it off.

35:55.372 --> 35:56.941
It's all right. It's all right.

35:57.976 --> 36:00.511
So, this ex-boyfriend
of yours...

36:00.645 --> 36:02.346
[woman] Toriano Bush.

36:03.380 --> 36:06.283
- What'd he do now?
- [Burns] Seven cops were murdered tonight.

36:07.785 --> 36:10.755
- [woman] Well, Toriano didn't do that.
- He picked up these two men.

36:11.756 --> 36:13.458
We think they're the murderers.

36:14.058 --> 36:16.594
There isn't a version of this
where these two aren't found.

36:16.728 --> 36:18.062
Cooperate now.

36:18.195 --> 36:20.565
Tell me something I don't know,

36:20.698 --> 36:23.166
and that's the beginning of
the end of our time together.

36:23.768 --> 36:26.504
[woman] Toriano couldn't
kill anyone, you know?

36:26.638 --> 36:28.940
You said that.
But he's a criminal, right?

36:29.073 --> 36:32.342
[woman] Small-time. Wanted to get out.
He was always just too deep in debt.

36:32.477 --> 36:33.811
Is that why you left him?

36:34.277 --> 36:35.980
Debt don't bother me.

36:37.314 --> 36:38.916
Who was Becky
with the good hair?

36:41.586 --> 36:43.755
This waitress ho at the Pan-Am.

36:44.388 --> 36:46.124
- Check it.
- Thank you.

36:49.427 --> 36:50.862
[Andre sighs]

36:52.764 --> 36:53.965
Sit.

36:58.268 --> 36:59.470
Give us a sec.

37:02.205 --> 37:05.977
Hey, Yolanda, get me everything
you have on Toriano Bush.

37:06.110 --> 37:08.513
And get cameras up and around
the Pan-Am Lounge.

37:08.646 --> 37:09.687
He has a girlfriend there.

37:09.747 --> 37:10.815
[Yolanda] <i>Got it.</i>

37:20.792 --> 37:21.826
[exhales]

37:21.959 --> 37:23.061
You have it in hundreds?

37:23.193 --> 37:24.562
Brown people spend Benjamins,

37:24.696 --> 37:26.097
brown people get followed.

37:27.131 --> 37:28.331
Weighs as much as the coke.

37:28.466 --> 37:29.466
[Hawk] You about right.

37:29.567 --> 37:31.769
A million in 20s is 110 pounds.

37:31.903 --> 37:34.105
And stay away from all canines.

37:34.237 --> 37:37.508
They go <i>Cujo</i> because every dollar in
circulation is covered in cocaine atoms,

37:37.642 --> 37:39.877
and y'all got 50,000 of those
bills in six small bags.

37:40.011 --> 37:41.855
- How do I clean it?
- You don't know some dude who owns a strip club

37:41.879 --> 37:44.482
- or a parking lot?
- This is seven figures.

37:44.615 --> 37:46.184
Who do you use?

37:46.316 --> 37:49.187
[woman] Who everybody else with
seven or more digits does.

37:49.319 --> 37:52.255
Sudanese brother over in
the Meatpacking named Adi.

37:52.389 --> 37:54.492
Cops, too. He's Switzerland.

37:54.625 --> 37:55.727
What does that mean?

37:55.860 --> 37:57.462
[Hawk]
Means he's gonna take 300,000,

37:57.595 --> 37:59.940
but he can sort bank accounts,
passports, whatever you need.

37:59.964 --> 38:02.299
I heard about this dude.
Exclusive.

38:04.669 --> 38:06.037
He owe you money?

38:06.170 --> 38:07.939
Bush owes everybody money.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.942
Yeah? How much?

38:11.075 --> 38:14.946
$17,512, as of this morning.

38:15.480 --> 38:16.881
[Ray] What are you doing?

38:19.016 --> 38:20.785
I just bought your Lincoln.

38:26.691 --> 38:27.725
Let's get out of here.

38:29.861 --> 38:31.294
[Andre] They'll never know.

38:32.463 --> 38:34.098
You'll never see me again.

38:35.133 --> 38:36.501
I promise.

38:43.107 --> 38:44.442
Yeah, that's...

38:46.711 --> 38:49.080
probably Raymond Jackson.

38:49.213 --> 38:50.548
"Probably"?

38:50.681 --> 38:52.450
Because he always wears
a demon mask?

38:53.050 --> 38:57.287
Not many white dudes born and raised
where we were during World War Crack.

38:57.421 --> 38:58.623
[Andre] Okay.

38:59.457 --> 39:00.691
So he's a tough guy.

39:01.425 --> 39:04.162
[chuckles]
Yeah, fighting his whole life.

39:04.294 --> 39:05.395
When we were kids,

39:05.530 --> 39:08.365
I watched him beat a grown man

39:08.499 --> 39:13.336
for stepping on this boy
Arvell's sneakers.

39:13.471 --> 39:14.906
This was before the army.

39:15.039 --> 39:16.574
Arvell?

39:16.707 --> 39:18.009
Who's Arvell?

39:18.910 --> 39:20.144
Arvell Trujillo.

39:21.311 --> 39:23.581
He and Ray,
they joined up together.

39:23.714 --> 39:26.117
They just did everything
together.

39:26.250 --> 39:28.318
Is that who else is in the car?

39:28.452 --> 39:29.654
No.

39:30.353 --> 39:32.990
Arvell was blown up
in Afghanistan.

39:39.096 --> 39:40.998
[inhales]

39:41.499 --> 39:43.134
The other man in that car...

39:44.969 --> 39:48.639
is probably Arvell's
little brother, Michael.

39:49.173 --> 39:51.209
Because Ray protects him now.

39:53.978 --> 39:55.479
Michael's smart, you know?

39:55.613 --> 39:56.881
He could have been anything

39:57.014 --> 39:59.317
if he'd have just been born
somewhere else.

40:00.383 --> 40:02.653
But after Arvell was killed,

40:02.787 --> 40:04.522
Michael joined up.

40:05.122 --> 40:08.092
But I heard
he attacked a sergeant.

40:09.994 --> 40:11.195
Okay.

40:12.830 --> 40:14.031
Thank you.

40:19.503 --> 40:21.239
[police radio chatter]

40:21.371 --> 40:23.407
[sirens blaring in distance]

40:53.070 --> 40:55.048
- Come on in.
- [reporter on TV] <i>We are getting reports</i>

40:55.072 --> 40:59.410
<i>of huge traffic jams at the outbound
entrances, bridges, and tunnels.</i>

40:59.543 --> 41:02.413
<i>No one is getting off
this island tonight.</i>

41:05.549 --> 41:07.318
You're causing quite a stir.

41:07.451 --> 41:09.329
[reporter 2 on TV] <i>...wanted for
the slaughter of seven officers</i>

41:09.353 --> 41:13.324
<i>in Brooklyn tonight are Raymond
Jackson and Michael Trujillo.</i>

41:13.457 --> 41:17.228
<i>Jackson, at 32 years old,
a long history of violent crime.</i>

41:17.361 --> 41:20.564
<i>Trujillo, 26 years old,

41:20.698 --> 41:22.934
<i>Both men are ex-military...</i>

[man] Put your bags in here.

41:25.069 --> 41:27.872
<i>Trujillo was
dishonorably discharged.</i>

41:28.005 --> 41:29.106
[whispers] Fuck.

<i>We're just getting a statement
from the NYPD, just issued.</i>

41:32.677 --> 41:37.014
<i>We have been told that the injured
officer, Jennifer Montgomery,</i>

41:37.148 --> 41:42.286
<i>was taken off life support and
declared dead just minutes ago.</i>

41:59.570 --> 42:00.671
Don't wanna count it?

42:01.406 --> 42:04.075
No one cheats the man who
knows where all their money is.

42:05.476 --> 42:07.278
Do not close that fucking safe.

42:07.412 --> 42:08.455
What the fuck are you doing?

42:08.479 --> 42:09.880
- I don't buy it.
- Buy what?

42:10.014 --> 42:11.014
This guy, this place.

42:11.115 --> 42:12.235
Where the fuck are we, Mike?

42:12.283 --> 42:13.718
What are we doing?
This isn't us.

42:13.851 --> 42:15.686
We have a million
in fucking cash.

42:15.820 --> 42:17.722
You ever think we'd see that?

42:17.855 --> 42:19.991
You ever think Arvell
even dreamed of this shit?

42:20.124 --> 42:21.868
Now we're just gonna give it
to him? Then what?

42:21.892 --> 42:24.495
He's gonna put it
in the fucking safe, type,

42:24.628 --> 42:26.197
and give us
some fucking gift cards?

42:26.330 --> 42:28.899
- It's that easy?
- Bush knew about this dude.

42:30.101 --> 42:33.472
"Exclusive," remember?
Bush heard about him.

42:34.171 --> 42:36.240
Fucking Toriano's
how all this started.

42:36.374 --> 42:39.076
No, us not walking away
is how this started.

42:40.211 --> 42:42.613
Look, Ray, I get it.
None of this shit makes any sense.

42:43.114 --> 42:45.516
It ain't like anything
we've ever known.

42:45.649 --> 42:47.818
But ain't no plan B I can see.

42:48.853 --> 42:50.521
They shut down the island.

42:51.522 --> 42:53.824
We can't run around with
100 pounds of stained cash.

42:54.426 --> 42:56.961
He puts this money in some
accounts somewhere far from here,

42:57.094 --> 42:58.895
and then we figure out
how to get to it later.

42:59.964 --> 43:02.333
Ray, put it down.

43:02.467 --> 43:04.335
[breathing heavily]

43:09.508 --> 43:10.941
You fuck us,

43:11.075 --> 43:13.911
and I will fucking bury you
where you stand.

43:33.964 --> 43:35.500
I need a fucking scotch.

43:35.633 --> 43:37.268
I'll pour us both one.

43:47.278 --> 43:48.646
[officer] We got a match.

43:49.747 --> 43:50.747
We got a hit.

43:50.848 --> 43:52.116
<i>Bush is at the club.</i>

43:52.249 --> 43:54.852
Positive ID on Toriano Bush
at the Pan-Am.

Closest units,
converge on the Pan-Am Lounge.

43:58.322 --> 43:59.524

No, no! Listen to me, baby.

- Bush!
- [sergeant 1] Get the fuck back!

44:36.060 --> 44:37.928
- Hey, get the fuck back!
- I'm an EMT.

44:38.062 --> 44:39.598
I don't give a shit!
Get the fuck back!

44:40.565 --> 44:42.601
[sirens blaring]

44:48.272 --> 44:49.883
[Burns] Out of the way.
Get out of the way!

44:49.907 --> 44:51.284
[Andre]
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

Move, move, move!

45:04.321 --> 45:07.658
[line ringing]

45:07.791 --> 45:10.361
Come on, Andre.
Answer your fucking phone.

45:10.495 --> 45:12.329
[sobbing, chattering]

45:12.464 --> 45:13.998
What the fuck is this?

45:14.131 --> 45:15.500
[Andre] Hey!

45:17.101 --> 45:18.778
- Didn't I say wait?
- [sergeant 2] We disobeyed.

45:18.802 --> 45:20.515
- You disobeyed?
- He didn't kill one of your brothers.

45:20.539 --> 45:22.149
So fuck if I'm gonna
let him get away with...

45:22.173 --> 45:24.251
What are you, fucking stupid?
He didn't kill anybody!

45:24.275 --> 45:26.043
He could have led us
to the two who did!

45:26.177 --> 45:28.513
[phone ringing]

45:29.680 --> 45:31.015
[waitress crying]

45:31.148 --> 45:32.829
[sergeant 1] We yelled.
He pulled. We shot.

45:33.317 --> 45:35.386
End of story.
One down, two to go.

45:35.520 --> 45:36.987
[waitress]
That's fucking bullshit!

45:37.121 --> 45:38.499
[sergeant 1] Says the side piece
of a man who helped

45:38.523 --> 45:39.857
fucking cop killers!

45:39.990 --> 45:41.334
[sergeant 2] How many drinks
you have tonight?

45:41.358 --> 45:43.227
Hey, don't do
what you're doing right now.

45:43.360 --> 45:44.828
Get your fucking hands off me.

45:44.962 --> 45:46.263
[waitress] No!

45:46.897 --> 45:48.933
What? What?

45:50.635 --> 45:53.075
[sergeant 1] Officer,
get them the fuck out of here. Let's go.

45:56.207 --> 45:57.409
You said Bush pulled.

45:58.342 --> 45:59.511
Pulled what?

45:59.644 --> 46:01.178
A fucking .38?

46:01.312 --> 46:03.714
The other two got suppressed
submachine guns,

46:03.847 --> 46:07.318
and Bush was carrying a piece you only
ever see in a meth addict's glove box...

46:08.852 --> 46:10.387
or a fat cop's ankle holster.

46:11.155 --> 46:12.315
[sergeant 1] Hey, whoa, whoa.

46:12.389 --> 46:13.491
[Andre] Who was that, LMSI?

46:13.625 --> 46:15.726
Nanny. Sorry.
My little girl's...

46:16.393 --> 46:17.696
Is everything all right?

46:18.195 --> 46:19.564
No, but we'll be fine.

46:21.499 --> 46:23.067
What the fuck is going on here?

46:24.536 --> 46:26.237
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

46:27.505 --> 46:29.541
[sirens blaring in distance]

46:35.813 --> 46:38.082
Bahamas is right
for your skin color.

46:38.683 --> 46:39.850
You'll go via Miami.

46:39.984 --> 46:41.686
Three hundred twenty-six
is short.

46:41.819 --> 46:42.886
[man] The rest is cash.

46:43.921 --> 46:46.558
You are now Christopher James.

46:46.691 --> 46:51.228
And, Ray, your new name
is William Simpson.

46:54.599 --> 46:56.066
Take separate buses to Miami.

46:56.934 --> 46:58.737
There's a man named Swift
in Little Havana.

46:58.869 --> 47:01.205
He runs a bar at the corner
of Flagler and 27th Street.

47:01.338 --> 47:04.542
He also sells passports.
They'll be under your new names.

47:04.676 --> 47:07.579
Then you will pay cash
for a charter boat to Nassau.

47:07.712 --> 47:10.715
There is a ski boot bag
and backpack behind that door.

47:10.848 --> 47:12.116
I'll put 15 in each...

47:12.249 --> 47:13.618
[loud banging on door]

47:15.620 --> 47:16.655
[Ray] What was that?

47:16.787 --> 47:18.289
It's exactly
what it sounds like.

47:22.494 --> 47:25.630
Whoever is at my door,
you wait and you think.

47:34.104 --> 47:35.740
NYPD! Open up!

47:46.751 --> 47:48.285
What precinct are you from?

47:51.121 --> 47:52.823
Because I'll have your fucking...

47:52.956 --> 47:54.992
[gunfire]

47:55.125 --> 47:56.126
[screams]

47:58.095 --> 47:59.330

47:59.698 --> 48:00.698
[Ray] Going in!

48:00.799 --> 48:02.299
[gunfire continues]

48:02.434 --> 48:04.469
[screaming]

48:10.675 --> 48:12.510
[moans] Fuck!

48:29.828 --> 48:31.995
[chattering]

48:33.197 --> 48:34.799
You two
better not have fucked up.

48:40.003 --> 48:41.038
Are we good?

48:41.673 --> 48:42.973
Is this my case, Captain?

48:43.107 --> 48:45.142
This is all hands on deck,
but you're lead.

48:45.275 --> 48:46.511
Someone should tell them.

48:47.111 --> 48:48.145
Look, they're angry.

48:48.879 --> 48:49.880
They're in pain.

48:50.682 --> 48:53.217
Butchco and his wife were
close with Jennifer Montgomery.

48:54.686 --> 48:56.296
She didn't make it.
They just pulled the plug.

48:56.320 --> 48:57.665
[officer over radio]
<i>10-13, we need backup!</i>

48:57.689 --> 48:59.056
This is Kelly!

We're on Ninth and 13th,

Trujillo and Jackson here!</i>

49:05.563 --> 49:07.532

49:11.235 --> 49:13.170
How the fuck
did Kelly find them?

49:13.303 --> 49:15.072
[siren wailing]

49:15.973 --> 49:17.107
[yells]

49:18.909 --> 49:21.413
I can't see anything.

49:21.546 --> 49:23.782
I can't fucking see.

49:24.516 --> 49:26.551
We didn't fuck you over, man.
I swear.

49:27.050 --> 49:29.587
[officer] Put those guns in your
mouths, you motherfuckers!

49:30.789 --> 49:31.823
[muttering]

49:33.090 --> 49:34.759
Fucking 8-5.

49:35.693 --> 49:36.761
What?

49:36.895 --> 49:37.729
[officer 2]
Throw your guns down,

49:37.862 --> 49:38.863
you motherfuckers!

49:40.197 --> 49:41.466
It's his thumb drives.

49:42.901 --> 49:44.268
The thumb drives!

49:50.941 --> 49:52.976
[gunfire continues]

50:03.455 --> 50:05.690
[glass shattering]

50:07.625 --> 50:08.660
What is it?

50:09.393 --> 50:11.128
- "Coolhand."
- Huh?

50:11.629 --> 50:16.468
"Coolhand," one word, lowercase.

50:16.601 --> 50:18.736
[officer] Get the shotgun.
Get the shotgun!

50:20.070 --> 50:21.439
We gotta fucking move.

50:35.285 --> 50:37.321

[chattering]

51:15.593 --> 51:16.728
[grunts]

51:36.814 --> 51:38.081
We gotta split up.

51:38.650 --> 51:40.418
We're too easy to track
if we're together.

51:40.552 --> 51:42.887
No. No way, man. You need help.

He ain't like me.

53:46.077 --> 53:47.111
Mike.

53:48.079 --> 53:49.346
He ain't like me.

54:53.644 --> 54:54.679
Is Ray dead?

54:55.312 --> 54:56.346
I hope so.

54:57.682 --> 54:59.382
[Andre] Michael?

55:06.791 --> 55:07.825
Is he dead?

55:10.762 --> 55:11.796
[Andre] Yes.

55:12.930 --> 55:14.098
[Michael] Stop walking.

55:14.232 --> 55:16.134
[Burns]
You got a clear shot. Take it.

55:16.266 --> 55:17.468
Don't worry about me.

55:17.602 --> 55:19.269
[both panting]

55:20.838 --> 55:21.838
You got lucky.

55:22.440 --> 55:23.474
[Andre] Yeah.

55:24.242 --> 55:26.210
Luckier than the civilian
he just murdered.

55:27.945 --> 55:29.447
Add that to the list of cops.

55:30.081 --> 55:32.392
How many bodies stacked up
against you now that Ray is dead?

55:32.416 --> 55:35.153
- Don't try and get into my head, okay?
- Simple truths, Michael.

55:35.285 --> 55:36.285
And don't use my name!

55:36.386 --> 55:37.855
Take the shot!

55:38.321 --> 55:39.857
[Michael] Stop fucking walking!

55:42.593 --> 55:44.495
I think most of this mess
is his.

55:46.497 --> 55:48.533
But you're balls-deep
in it now, Michael.

55:50.701 --> 55:53.638
For guys like Ray,
I'm natural causes.

55:53.771 --> 55:54.972
But what about you?

55:55.106 --> 55:56.627
Fuck you know
about guys like Ray, huh?

55:57.742 --> 55:59.143
Fuck you know
about guys like me?

55:59.277 --> 56:00.377
[Andre] Saw your records.

56:01.579 --> 56:06.751
Marine. Tried to follow in your brother's
footsteps after he got sent home in a box.

56:07.585 --> 56:12.723
But you...
dishonorably discharged.

56:12.857 --> 56:14.158
Insubordination.

56:14.725 --> 56:15.793
I get it.

56:16.994 --> 56:18.863
Some of us are killers, Michael.

56:19.362 --> 56:24.535
But you, I think the last thing you
want is to take a life for no reason.

56:26.504 --> 56:27.705
And how you know that, huh?

56:27.839 --> 56:29.941
Because you would have
killed her by now.

56:30.074 --> 56:31.175
Shoot him!

56:31.309 --> 56:33.010
- [Andre] No!
- Fucking shoot him!

56:33.144 --> 56:34.645
Michael wants to talk.

56:34.779 --> 56:36.814
So, come on, Michael.
Let's talk.

56:36.948 --> 56:40.350
He wants to talk, tell him to do it
without a gun to my fucking head, Andre.

56:40.484 --> 56:41.586
Burns, be cool.

56:41.719 --> 56:42.920
This is fucking cool.

56:43.054 --> 56:45.022
Just give me a second here.

56:47.458 --> 56:49.060
None of this shit
makes any sense.

56:50.661 --> 56:53.664
The manager at the spot we hit,
he knew the cops were coming.

56:53.798 --> 56:55.266
It's called a silent alarm.

56:55.398 --> 56:57.802
No. He checked his watch
before it all happened.

56:59.036 --> 57:00.571
And the first four
came peacefully.

57:02.006 --> 57:05.409
I mean, one fucking knocked with his
knuckles like a Jehovah's Witness,

57:05.543 --> 57:07.478
not with the side of his hand
like a fucking cop.

57:07.612 --> 57:10.514
Andre, for the love of Christ,
are you really gonna entertain this shit?

57:10.648 --> 57:12.850
Three hundred keys, pure.

57:13.818 --> 57:15.019
I mean, what the fuck?

57:17.188 --> 57:19.223
This whole thing is filthy.

57:19.357 --> 57:23.227
You can't move that type of weight
around without cartels or cops or both.

57:25.529 --> 57:27.498
And the cops shot
the Cleaner upstairs,

57:28.699 --> 57:30.835
fired right through
the peephole, no warning.

57:31.669 --> 57:33.704
They were there
for more than just us.

57:35.673 --> 57:38.509
And right before we left,
the Cleaner gave me thumb drives.

57:39.243 --> 57:40.243
Gave what?

57:40.344 --> 57:41.479
Drives.

57:41.612 --> 57:42.813
USBs and shit.

57:46.751 --> 57:48.419
- What's on them?
- [Burns] Andre.

57:48.552 --> 57:49.787
All he said was "8-5."

57:49.921 --> 57:51.322
Cop-killing piece of shit!

57:51.455 --> 57:53.291
- There's no fucking...
- Burns, stop! Stop!

57:53.424 --> 57:54.992
Michael, look at me.

57:55.126 --> 57:57.406
- Don't fuck with me!
- [Andre] Nobody's fucking with you.

57:59.664 --> 58:03.901
But facts: You shoot her,
I'm gonna kill you in the same breath.

58:04.035 --> 58:06.737
And everything you think you
know or may have means nothing.

58:06.871 --> 58:11.742
So drop your weapon,
and let's take a look at the drives.

58:11.876 --> 58:14.445
No. No, I can't do that.

58:14.578 --> 58:16.723
- Michael, I need you to trust me.
- I don't trust anybody!

58:16.747 --> 58:17.949
You have no choice.

58:20.051 --> 58:23.788
You're not gonna escape to some island
somewhere, even after they open this one.

58:23.921 --> 58:25.623
You're smart enough
to know that.

58:26.624 --> 58:27.959
I am, huh?

58:28.092 --> 58:29.893
The world's just gonna
keep closing in on you.

58:31.228 --> 58:35.633
But you can survive this if you
just give yourself up to me.

58:38.035 --> 58:39.035
No! Michael!

58:41.038 --> 58:42.039
No!

58:46.577 --> 58:47.577
[panting]

58:47.645 --> 58:48.646
Are you okay?

58:49.313 --> 58:50.848
What the fuck are you doing?

59:19.043 --> 59:20.911
[siren wailing]

59:22.947 --> 59:24.882
- [radio beeps]
- This is Davis.

59:26.150 --> 59:28.386
Lock down everything
in a seven-block radius

59:28.519 --> 59:31.155
from Weichsel Beef's
center of the circle.

59:31.288 --> 59:35.693
Positive ID on Michael Trujillo
leaving there 90 seconds ago.

59:36.627 --> 59:39.130
Trujillo has information
vital to this case.

59:39.864 --> 59:41.699
He must be brought in alive.

59:43.868 --> 59:45.504
- Let me see.
- I'm fine.

59:46.471 --> 59:47.472
Yeah, you look it.

59:48.072 --> 59:49.907
I wanna know
what's on those drives.

59:51.008 --> 59:53.820
[officer over radio] <i>Central, advise the

01:00:36.821 --> 01:00:38.722
Disgusting. It's disgusting.

01:00:39.056 --> 01:00:41.192
[desk clerk] And the pool
is on the 26th floor.

- [Michael] Shh!

01:01:20.731 --> 01:01:22.434
I won't hurt you
if you stay quiet.

01:01:23.568 --> 01:01:24.603
You got it?

01:01:26.404 --> 01:01:27.439
Nod.

01:01:32.743 --> 01:01:34.412
[man] Shit. Fuck.

01:01:36.247 --> 01:01:37.681
[Michael panting]

01:01:38.649 --> 01:01:39.683
What's the password?

01:01:40.818 --> 01:01:41.952
Um...

01:01:42.086 --> 01:01:43.354
"Eightclap1."

01:01:43.954 --> 01:01:45.624
Gotta spell the word "eight."

01:01:45.756 --> 01:01:46.790
One is the number.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.195
- One word?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:54.932 --> 01:01:55.932
Close your eyes.

01:02:03.207 --> 01:02:05.109

01:02:08.513 --> 01:02:11.015
[police radio chatter]

01:02:24.061 --> 01:02:25.262
Why didn't you shoot him?

01:02:26.631 --> 01:02:28.232
They told me you were fearless.

01:02:28.899 --> 01:02:31.068
The guy who kills cop killers.

01:02:32.336 --> 01:02:34.071
I just need the truth,
that's all.

01:02:34.205 --> 01:02:36.373
You believe a cop killer?

01:02:38.976 --> 01:02:41.212
Good work, Kelly. Get some rest.

01:02:47.151 --> 01:02:49.053
You took down
one vicious son of a bitch.

01:02:49.887 --> 01:02:52.289
Yeah, not before he killed
an innocent civilian.

01:02:52.424 --> 01:02:54.426
World's a better place
with that guy gone.

01:02:55.493 --> 01:02:56.493
You seen his record?

01:02:57.094 --> 01:02:58.530
Glanced at it.

01:03:00.231 --> 01:03:02.366
I knew I had the right guy
for this.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:04.569
All hands on deck, right?

01:03:05.202 --> 01:03:08.038
It was your boys who smoked
them out of this apartment.

01:03:08.172 --> 01:03:10.274
How did Lieutenant Kelly
even get here so quick?

01:03:10.408 --> 01:03:13.010
[Antoine]
Look at this fucking mess.

01:03:13.678 --> 01:03:16.213
- You still got one guy on the run, right?
- Yeah.

01:03:17.248 --> 01:03:18.949
It's 4:37 a.m.

01:03:19.083 --> 01:03:21.885
You've got less than an hour
before I gotta open the island.

01:03:22.019 --> 01:03:25.155
You haven't gotten him by then,
we're all eating shit for breakfast.

01:03:25.289 --> 01:03:26.725
Don't worry about
the other perp.

01:03:26.857 --> 01:03:29.827
Andre put that motherfucker
in a seven-block box.

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:31.630

I'm any different?

Because you would have
shot me by now.

Where are those drives
we were talking about?

01:12:31.402 --> 01:12:32.470

you'll be carried out by others.

Michael, your only hope
is to tell the truth,

pray to God for forgiveness,

01:12:53.124 --> 01:12:55.526
and make peace with the fact
that you may die in prison.

Shooting you sounds
a whole lot better right now.

out what's on those drives.

I may not find the drives,

01:13:11.843 --> 01:13:13.878
but I will find out
why tonight happened.

But could you prove it?

01:13:17.114 --> 01:13:19.349
I only have to prove it
to myself.

01:14:15.907 --> 01:14:17.742
What the fuck, man?

01:14:19.210 --> 01:14:22.013
He was surrendering.
He was giving himself up.

01:14:22.546 --> 01:14:23.881
He was gonna shoot you.

01:14:24.015 --> 01:14:26.284
You didn't see the gun down?

01:14:26.417 --> 01:14:28.419
You didn't fucking see
the gun down?

01:14:29.186 --> 01:14:30.888
I thought he was gonna shoot.

01:17:03.508 --> 01:17:05.477
- This fucking thing is dead.
- [chuckles] Oh.

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:07.611
Can I borrow yours?

01:17:07.745 --> 01:17:09.414
Yeah, of course.

01:17:39.343 --> 01:17:40.479
- How's the hand?
- Okay.

01:17:40.611 --> 01:17:42.079
[no audible dialogue]

01:17:43.714 --> 01:17:45.249
Okay. Yes, ma'am.

01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:50.387
Voice mail.

01:17:51.722 --> 01:17:52.823
Shit.

01:17:57.161 --> 01:17:59.130
It's been a long night.
You get some rest.

01:17:59.263 --> 01:18:00.465
Yeah, you too.

01:18:02.066 --> 01:18:03.801
Go hug that daughter of yours.

01:18:49.113 --> 01:18:51.154
[reporter 1] <i>Manhattan
reopened at 7:05 this morning</i>

01:18:51.182 --> 01:18:55.686
<i>after a night of carnage that
saw eight police officers...</i>

01:18:55.819 --> 01:18:58.590

01:19:19.678 --> 01:19:21.045
[McKenna] What's up?

01:19:22.813 --> 01:19:24.848
[sighs] Goddammit.

01:19:25.849 --> 01:19:27.051
Okay, all right, calm down.

01:19:27.184 --> 01:19:29.554
Just come over to my place.

01:19:31.021 --> 01:19:32.223
Yeah.

01:19:33.558 --> 01:19:34.725
I understand.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.361
We'll figure something out.

01:19:38.062 --> 01:19:39.163
Just...

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.168
I gotta go.

01:19:44.301 --> 01:19:45.437
I got a visitor.

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.775
Put your gun down here.

01:20:12.363 --> 01:20:13.665
Who was on the phone?

01:20:15.099 --> 01:20:16.300
My wife.

01:20:18.135 --> 01:20:19.404
She's a nurse.

01:20:20.237 --> 01:20:21.439
Shift just started.

01:20:23.408 --> 01:20:25.510
And that's the story
of all married life.

01:20:30.715 --> 01:20:34.285
Guy that owned Mosto's
was your partner.

01:20:36.053 --> 01:20:37.821
Mosto's was your vault.

01:20:38.556 --> 01:20:43.461
The 8-5 was armored security, moving
drugs around the city in NYPD vehicles.

01:20:44.596 --> 01:20:47.465
Last night was just fucking
bad luck on every level.

01:20:48.265 --> 01:20:52.336
A rival hits Mosto's at the same time
your boys drop by to move a load of coke,

01:20:53.237 --> 01:20:56.173
run into men
with training, die, badly.

01:20:58.543 --> 01:21:02.346
Those men with training escape,
sell the drugs and clean the money,

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.182
coincidentally with
the same launderer you use.

01:21:05.983 --> 01:21:09.987
And you scorch earth
trying to cover it all up.

01:21:11.188 --> 01:21:12.956
[inhales]

01:21:14.258 --> 01:21:15.392
You're really good.

01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:18.829
Not good enough.

01:21:21.999 --> 01:21:24.602
Not all the cops killed
last night were a part of it.

01:21:24.736 --> 01:21:27.871
Clean or dirty,
they're all dead 'cause of you.

01:21:32.343 --> 01:21:33.778
So you know,

01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:41.553
this is not about Cadillacs and
fucking Rolexes, material bullshit.

01:21:43.921 --> 01:21:46.023
Not for me.
Not for most of my guys.

01:21:47.157 --> 01:21:48.660
It's about having a life.

01:21:52.664 --> 01:21:56.568
My first month running the 8-5,
I went to two of my cops' funerals.

01:21:58.135 --> 01:22:01.238
First one went 60 miles an
hour into a bridge abutment.

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:05.008
His blood alcohol was .25.

01:22:05.142 --> 01:22:07.244
Second guy
drank himself to death too.

01:22:08.212 --> 01:22:09.346
Cirrhosis.

01:22:11.014 --> 01:22:13.217
Three of my cops
had their homes foreclosed on.

01:22:15.352 --> 01:22:16.621
Another guy lost his apartment.

01:22:16.755 --> 01:22:19.056
Shitty landlord
doubled the rent.

01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:22.527
The divorce rate in the 8-5
was over 70%.

01:22:24.596 --> 01:22:26.598
This is about my cops
staying married,

01:22:28.733 --> 01:22:30.402
raising their kids,

01:22:30.535 --> 01:22:33.370
not having to spend four hours
a day sitting in traffic,

01:22:33.505 --> 01:22:36.373
crawling to and from a city
they can't afford to live in,

01:22:36.974 --> 01:22:39.844
a city that actively
fucking dislikes them.

01:22:42.647 --> 01:22:44.682
But a city that they protect...

01:22:45.884 --> 01:22:49.253
with their lives
every fucking day.

01:22:52.857 --> 01:22:54.191
That's what this is about.

01:22:58.763 --> 01:23:02.567
I'll tell you what, anybody tells you
money can't buy happiness is full of shit.

01:23:04.602 --> 01:23:06.236
And the 8-5 is proof.

01:23:10.374 --> 01:23:12.510
Frankie Burns is proof.

01:23:14.913 --> 01:23:17.123
Did you put her on this just to
make sure I did your bidding?

01:23:17.147 --> 01:23:19.651
I put her on this 'cause she
might be as good as you.

01:23:20.984 --> 01:23:22.921
And she's got everything
to lose.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.937
Three guys murdered my father.

01:23:40.939 --> 01:23:42.105
He took two with him.

01:23:42.239 --> 01:23:43.273
But the third,

01:23:45.743 --> 01:23:51.783
he hit my dad so many times he
broke every bone in his face.

01:23:54.985 --> 01:23:57.120
That's why we had to have
a closed casket.

01:24:00.725 --> 01:24:02.025
Guy told the judge...

01:24:03.393 --> 01:24:05.295
he didn't even remember
doing it.

01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:07.599
He was so jacked, so...

01:24:09.601 --> 01:24:12.336
so high on cocaine
and angel dust.

01:24:14.371 --> 01:24:16.006
The drugs
have always been there.

01:24:17.442 --> 01:24:18.676
And they always will be.

01:24:18.810 --> 01:24:20.812
And people will always die
because of them.

01:24:22.112 --> 01:24:27.317
That blood, that blood
cannot be on the badge.

01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:37.929
You can't prove where
those flash drives came from.

01:24:41.766 --> 01:24:44.636
And nobody is gonna
take the stand against me.

01:24:47.371 --> 01:24:51.509
So if you go down this road,
Andre, you're on your own.

01:24:54.546 --> 01:24:57.549
You'll be looking over your
shoulder the rest of your life.

01:24:58.483 --> 01:24:59.918
- I know.
- [car door closing]

01:25:02.119 --> 01:25:03.153
[car door closing]

01:25:04.556 --> 01:25:06.424
Or you could just look
the other way.

01:25:09.293 --> 01:25:11.261
I'd rather
look the devil in the eye.

01:25:35.085 --> 01:25:36.119
[grunts]

01:25:58.509 --> 01:25:59.577
[grunts]

01:26:03.748 --> 01:26:05.416
[floor creaking]

01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:11.756
[McKenna inhales]

01:26:28.606 --> 01:26:30.508
[panting]

01:26:30.642 --> 01:26:31.843
[Andre] I get you?

01:26:35.413 --> 01:26:37.147
You wouldn't ask
if you didn't know.

01:26:39.951 --> 01:26:41.953
Hurts like a motherfucker,
right?

01:26:44.822 --> 01:26:45.857
I'll live.

01:26:49.494 --> 01:26:51.328
You can if you give yourself up.

01:26:54.499 --> 01:26:56.801
It's the only choice
available to you right now.

01:26:58.603 --> 01:26:59.604
Maybe.

01:27:36.874 --> 01:27:39.610
[panting]

01:27:43.047 --> 01:27:46.249
[McKenna groaning]

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:51.422
[McKenna breathing heavily]

01:28:12.176 --> 01:28:13.211
Don't do it.

01:29:04.762 --> 01:29:05.797
He's gone.

01:29:07.465 --> 01:29:08.599
It's over.

01:29:10.101 --> 01:29:11.334
So put your gun down.

01:29:17.141 --> 01:29:19.342
I'm gonna turn around
and face you, Burns.

01:29:19.477 --> 01:29:20.645
No.

01:29:29.954 --> 01:29:31.189
I'm gonna turn around.

01:29:40.164 --> 01:29:42.200
[inhales] I have the drives.

01:29:43.267 --> 01:29:44.735
I copied them.

01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:47.672
They're already
out in the world.

01:29:49.473 --> 01:29:52.076
[sirens wailing in distance]

01:29:53.511 --> 01:29:55.012
You're going down, Burns.

01:29:57.248 --> 01:30:01.018
Every dirty cop in the 8-5
is going down.

01:30:03.487 --> 01:30:05.323
You pull that trigger,
you get life.

01:30:08.358 --> 01:30:10.828
Your daughter doesn't need to
grow up without her mother.

01:30:22.974 --> 01:30:24.342
[exhales]

01:30:34.352 --> 01:30:35.519
Badge too.
