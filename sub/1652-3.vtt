WEBVTT

00:06.206 --> 00:07.072
.

00:07.074 --> 00:09.074
- Want some breakfast?

00:09.076 --> 00:12.211
- No, I'm good.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.212
- I talked to your aunt.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.214
She said it's fine.

00:15.216 --> 00:17.316
We got a room for you
and everything.

00:17.318 --> 00:20.386
- When's this happening?
- She'll be here tomorrow night.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.287
- It's not quick enough.

00:22.289 --> 00:23.756
- She's taking the day off
from work

00:23.758 --> 00:25.224
And driving here
from pittsburgh.

00:25.226 --> 00:28.394
That's as soon
as she can do it.

00:28.396 --> 00:31.296
Something going on
I should know about?

00:31.298 --> 00:34.166
- Trayzell said
I got to do a hit.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.567
- When?
- I don't know.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.169
He said
to just be ready.

00:37.171 --> 00:39.738
I gotta reprove myself
to him.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.407
- Okay.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.275
You're staying with me now.
I'll take you to my place.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.376
- I don't need a place
to crash.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.377
I need to get out.

00:45.379 --> 00:46.645
You said you'd do that
for me.

00:46.647 --> 00:50.215
- And I will.

00:56.556 --> 00:59.258
- I'm trusting you, man.

01:02.328 --> 01:03.829
- Diego going back
to school today?

01:03.831 --> 01:06.198
- Let's give him till Monday.
[cell phone chimes]

01:06.200 --> 01:08.267
It's not like he hasn't
been through a lot.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.335
- It's one of my cis.

01:10.337 --> 01:12.471
- Jasmine?
- Yeah.

01:12.473 --> 01:13.806
- She calls a lot.

01:13.808 --> 01:18.410
- I want to meet her.
- Now, there's a fun time.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.412
My wife
and my hooker ci?

01:20.414 --> 01:22.381
- I just want to, you know,
have her over for dinner.

01:22.383 --> 01:25.350
- Babe, I could be fired
for having her here.

01:25.352 --> 01:27.586
- We'll meet her
on neutral ground.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.089
We'll take her out
for dinner.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.091
- Nah.

01:32.093 --> 01:33.525
- Is there a reason
you don't--

01:33.527 --> 01:36.495
You don't want me
to meet her, antonio?

01:36.497 --> 01:38.764
- Baby, there's no need
for you

01:38.766 --> 01:41.100
To feel threatened by the skank,
junkie, hooker ci

01:41.102 --> 01:44.236
Who I deal with
because it's part of my job.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.405
- Then we will meet her
for dinner.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.476
- [sighs]

01:50.478 --> 01:52.377
- Hey listen, I got this thing
on Friday night,

01:52.379 --> 01:53.879
But I can blow it off
if you think--

01:53.881 --> 01:56.115
- What kind of thing?
- It's my engagement party.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.783
- Where's my invite?
- Ha.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.451
Seriously?
You know, that's all I need.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.752
"hey, sweetie,
this is my partner,

02:00.754 --> 02:02.788
"the married one
who lives in his garage.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.791
Don't worry, that's not
gonna happen to us."

02:05.793 --> 02:07.860
No offense, though, I don't want
you anywhere near her.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.394
- Does that mean
you set a date?

02:09.395 --> 02:12.364
- Ah, today's the 21st,
so 6 months today.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.333
- Oh, man,
today's the 21st.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.135
- Yeah, it usually follows
the 20th.

02:16.137 --> 02:17.836
What's up?
- Nothing.

02:17.838 --> 02:20.806
- All right, there are two
unrelated wire investigations.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.275
Surveillance followed three
of area central's

02:23.277 --> 02:27.246
Top-ranking gang targets
to this house on carpenter.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.747
Narcotics hasn't gotten
anywhere with it,

02:28.749 --> 02:31.416
So command staff
wants intelligence on it.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.285
Roll out in five.

02:38.591 --> 02:40.292
- Hey, hey, what are ya doing?

02:40.294 --> 02:42.761
- I need a desk.
- Not that one.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.930
That was willhite's desk.

02:44.932 --> 02:48.934
I'll let everybody know
when someone can use it.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.302
- Yeah.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074

03:07.320 --> 03:08.921
- We got the main eye.

03:08.923 --> 03:09.955
[walkie-talkie beeps]

03:09.957 --> 03:10.956
- We're set up
to the north.

03:10.958 --> 03:14.226
- We got the south
and a partial of the alley.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.228
- If anyone goes mobile
from the house,

03:16.230 --> 03:17.796
We're in position
for a take-away.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.531
- O and ruzek, move closer.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.266
See if there's any movement
in the house.

03:21.268 --> 03:23.302
- 10-4.
[shutter clicks]

03:25.838 --> 03:27.339
- Hold up.
We got company.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.244
- Who's this joker?

03:36.382 --> 03:38.383
[knocks on door]

03:40.653 --> 03:43.722
- Gun!
[gunfire]

03:53.933 --> 03:56.501
[gunshots]

03:56.503 --> 03:59.805
- Stay down!

03:59.807 --> 04:02.374
- [groaning]

04:05.812 --> 04:08.313
- Clear!
- Police!

04:10.984 --> 04:12.918
Clear!
- Hoodie's dead.

04:12.920 --> 04:13.952
- This one's alive.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.721
- Charlie 50-21, emergency.

04:15.723 --> 04:17.022
- What?
- He's gonna bleed out.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.257
We gotta put pressure
on the wound.

04:18.259 --> 04:19.658
- One shot fired by the police.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.628
Offender down.
Plainclothes officers on scene.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.663
- In here!

04:27.667 --> 04:29.034
Cop killers.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.974
Hey, look at this.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.977
- What do you got?

04:38.979 --> 04:40.412
Insulin.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.014
Somebody was a diabetic?

04:45.318 --> 04:46.952
Or not.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.554
- Is there a black market
for this stuff?

04:49.556 --> 04:51.957
- None that I've heard of.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.893
But you know what?

04:54.895 --> 04:57.863
It's a good place
to hide a bullet, though.

04:57.865 --> 04:59.564
- Nice work.

04:59.566 --> 05:08.807
.

05:08.809 --> 05:11.543
- Hey, sarge.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.744
You got
a calhoun county sheriff?

05:12.746 --> 05:14.446
- No, that's a beauty.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.580
- Yeah, my cousin's
dating a guy

05:15.582 --> 05:16.982
That works dispatch
in corpus christi.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.651
- Well, you tell your cousin
a "thank you" from me.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.753
- What about the one
I gave you?

05:21.755 --> 05:23.522
- Walla walla?

05:23.524 --> 05:27.326
Yeah, I traded that one.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.528
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.629
My friends
are coming into town.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.631
I want to give them
the grand tour.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.499
I'd rather not have platt
deep-sixing it.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.034
- Did you see a counselor?
- Counselor?

05:36.036 --> 05:37.402
I don't need to see
a counselor.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.571
- Well, I don't need
to wear pants,

05:39.573 --> 05:42.341
But, you know,
here I am.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.575
It's compulsory.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.078
- Yeah, and I'll pick up
something for dinner.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.647
- All right.
- No, end of discussion.

05:48.649 --> 05:52.684
- This is edward jelko, the
deceased street-level dealer.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.687
This is peter thomas banfill,
the offender,

05:55.689 --> 05:58.757
Currently baking in a coma
over at county.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.459
Jelko probably thought
like we did

06:00.461 --> 06:01.793
That banfill was sitting
on something big,

06:01.795 --> 06:02.794
Went over there
to rip him off.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.529
- These are m995s,

06:04.531 --> 06:06.998
Teflon-tipped,
kevlar-penetrating rounds.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.735
Ballistics has 'em linked
to several recent homicides.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.870
- And we found 100 of these
at the scene.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.740
It's for type r insulin,
which is a canadian designation.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.742
- And with any luck,
our little surprise visit

06:16.744 --> 06:18.076
Got the gun runners scrambling,
which means

06:18.078 --> 06:21.046
They're gonna make
mistakes, okay?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.714
Eyes open.

06:22.716 --> 06:27.586
Erin, come here a second,
will you?

06:27.588 --> 06:28.954
[sighs]

06:28.956 --> 06:30.021
- Do you want
the door closed?

06:30.023 --> 06:32.691
- Assume I always
want it closed.

06:32.693 --> 06:36.628
- Okay, tough guy.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.863
- Justin's getting
early release.

06:37.865 --> 06:39.698
He's moved up
to Friday night.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.767
- That's great.

06:41.769 --> 06:42.934
- Well, he's asking
if you can be there.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.669
It's no big deal
if you can't.

06:44.671 --> 06:46.638
- Are you crazy?
Of course it's a big deal.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.874
He's getting out.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.743
- Yeah.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.979
- What?

06:53.981 --> 06:57.482
Why do you look like somebody
just pissed in your coffee?

06:57.484 --> 07:01.720
- Gettin' out is always harder
than gettin' in.

07:01.722 --> 07:04.489
- Hank.

07:04.491 --> 07:08.827
Come on.

07:08.829 --> 07:12.731
Justin's gonna need
you around, okay?

07:12.733 --> 07:17.702
The tough love thing, it--
it didn't work.

07:17.704 --> 07:23.542
Tell antonio I'll be back
in an hour, okay?

07:23.544 --> 07:24.810
- Yeah.

07:24.812 --> 07:27.012
Cop-killer bullets
out on the street?

07:27.014 --> 07:29.815
- No.
I can ask around.

07:29.817 --> 07:33.051
- Would you?

07:33.053 --> 07:34.986
- That's it?

07:34.988 --> 07:36.221
How about next time,
you text me

07:36.223 --> 07:38.023
So I don't have to drive
a half hour in traffic?

07:38.025 --> 07:40.091
- I was wondering
if you want to grab dinner.

07:40.093 --> 07:43.161
- You and me? Like a date?

07:43.163 --> 07:45.764
- Yes or no?

07:45.766 --> 07:47.732
- When?

07:47.734 --> 07:49.768
- Tomorrow night, 7:00.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.237
- I already have a dinner.

07:52.239 --> 07:56.508
- Unless you want to pay me
400 bucks for lost wages,

07:56.510 --> 07:58.844
I'm gonna have
to take a rain check.

07:58.846 --> 08:01.112
- [chuckles]

08:01.114 --> 08:02.814
- Hey!

08:02.816 --> 08:07.486
A company near toronto named
"markham medical supply,"

08:07.488 --> 08:09.621
Their sales rep makes a run here
every other Thursday.

08:09.623 --> 08:11.089
He left at 5:00
this morning.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.257
- I'm guessing
they have tracking numbers

08:12.259 --> 08:13.825
On all their products?
- Yep.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.996
Locate him on gp, and--
you already did that.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.798
- Yep, atwater and burgess

08:19.800 --> 08:20.732
Are en route
tracking the signal.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.634
- Nice.

08:22.636 --> 08:24.102
- Do me one favor:
Do not give me

08:24.104 --> 08:26.004
One of those open-fingered
explosion hands that people do.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.506
I hate that.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.941
If it's your thing,
I'd rather high five.

08:35.815 --> 08:38.250
Never again.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.684
Hey.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.754
- Hey, halstead.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.756
Any word on banfill?

08:44.758 --> 08:46.858
- He's still in the icu.
You seen the counselor yet?

08:46.860 --> 08:47.993
- Yeah, this afternoon.

08:47.995 --> 08:49.027
You know, I'm gonna send out
a memo

08:49.029 --> 08:50.262
So people
can stop asking me.

08:50.264 --> 08:51.563
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:51.565 --> 08:52.631
Who do you think
you're talking to?

08:52.633 --> 08:56.134
You got 10 minutes
on this job.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.703
- It's--a lot of people
have been asking me.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.673
- Say that next time.

09:01.675 --> 09:02.741
- No, you're right.
You're right.

09:02.743 --> 09:03.975
I got it.
- Okay.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.811
- All right.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.152
- Detective voight.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.087
- Actually, it's sergeant now.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.923
How do you know me?

09:17.925 --> 09:19.891
- Casper.
- Oh, yeah, casper.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.761
He's with the vice lords.

09:22.763 --> 09:24.696
I heard
he's in marion now.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.965
- Yeah, didn't work out
too well for him.

09:26.967 --> 09:31.803
I mean, it worked out
good for you, though.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.706
Look, I know who you are
and what you're about.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.208
But you are legit
now, right?

09:37.210 --> 09:38.777
[snickers]

09:38.779 --> 09:43.915
- I need to talk
to you alone.

09:43.917 --> 09:47.018
- No, you can speak to me
right here.

09:49.622 --> 09:51.690
- D'anthony.

09:51.692 --> 09:54.059
I want him out.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.729
Get-out-of-jail-free card
for you in return.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.931
- So you want little d, huh?

09:59.933 --> 10:01.132
[chuckles]

10:01.134 --> 10:05.303
You into that?
[laughter]

10:05.305 --> 10:07.772
- Did I come here
disrespecting you?

10:07.774 --> 10:10.241
- You know I put
a lot of money and time

10:10.243 --> 10:12.611
Into that boy, right?

10:12.613 --> 10:14.312
See, you may want to give me
some paper

10:14.314 --> 10:17.349
As opposed
to some damn business card.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.322
Give me 10 grand,
and he's yours.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.968
- I'll be in touch.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.674
- Yeah, right on morgan.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.676
Hey, do you think you could
hook me up with a car?

10:44.678 --> 10:46.011
- Mm, I don't know.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.245
There's such thing as lead time,
that kind of stuff.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.714
- I know,
it's just kind of a big deal.

10:49.716 --> 10:51.383
It's my flight attendant
friends, and I was kind of--

10:51.385 --> 10:53.652
- Hold up, flight attendants?

10:53.654 --> 10:58.690
- Well, yeah.
Well--psh, I'll get you a car.

10:58.692 --> 11:01.793
Should of said that upfront.
I'll get you a good car.

11:04.430 --> 11:05.897
- This is it.

11:09.301 --> 11:11.236
Nobody's delivering
medical supplies here.

11:26.686 --> 11:30.422
- Police!
Show me your hands!

11:30.424 --> 11:36.428
.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.963
- This is definitely
our sales rep.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.699
George wilenko, 41.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.201
He's been with markham medical
for 17 years.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.337
No record, fully bonded,
has border clearance.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.840
This guy's
not your typical smuggler.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.942
- You notice the cup?

11:56.082 --> 11:58.049
- Lipstick on the lid.

12:00.753 --> 12:02.153
- These are what
we're looking for.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.457
C7s, a variant used
by the canadian army.

12:05.459 --> 12:07.325
An armory up there
was robbed.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.061
3,000 rounds of ammo
and 50 c7s were stolen.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.429
- Bigger market
for sprayers down here.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.131
- Victim's wife
drove down with him.

12:13.133 --> 12:16.167
Halstead and lindsay
are bringing her in.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.303
- Good.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.306
Hey.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.208
You're working
that kelly severide thing

12:23.210 --> 12:26.177
- Yeah, during the blackout,
he got mixed up

12:26.179 --> 12:27.812
With that knucklehead
vince keeler?

12:27.814 --> 12:29.814
- Yeah, I know keeler.
He's bad news.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.216
- Which is exactly
what I told severide

12:31.218 --> 12:33.418
And why he needs
to stay away from that guy.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.020
- Severide's sister katie
was reported missing.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.223
- How long?
- 16 hours.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.824
She's an adult,
really nothing we can do

12:39.826 --> 12:43.228
Until it's 24,
but she is a fireman's sister,

12:43.230 --> 12:45.230
Basically one of our own,
so area central's

12:45.232 --> 12:47.132
Already got a task force
on it.

12:47.134 --> 12:50.201
They said they'd call
if they need us.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.138
So meantime, we got
our own case to work, okay?

12:58.010 --> 12:59.344
- Absolutely.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.279
- Don't arrest us, officer.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.914
- Hey!

13:02.916 --> 13:06.017
Oh, my--
look who made it to chicago.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.086
Hi.
How are you?

13:08.088 --> 13:10.155
Hi.

13:10.157 --> 13:13.158
Oh, my god, come on,
I'll give you the grand tour.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.161
- Yeah, let's go.
- Kevin atwater.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.496
- Yes, hailey, genevieve, vera,
this is my partner.

13:18.498 --> 13:19.898
- I look out for her.

13:19.900 --> 13:20.899
- I'll bet you do.

13:20.901 --> 13:23.134
- Oh.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.371
Spicy.

13:26.373 --> 13:29.808
- This is it.
- It's awesome.

13:29.810 --> 13:32.110
- Hey, sarge.

13:32.112 --> 13:35.980
- Ladies, this is
our desk sergeant, trudy platt.

13:35.982 --> 13:39.918
- This is her district, and
she runs it firmly but fairly.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.119
Nothing gets by this woman.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.187
So if you guys
will follow me.

13:42.189 --> 13:45.156
- Including you.
- I just wanted--

13:45.158 --> 13:49.294
- Drunk and disorderly
at duffy's tavern.

13:49.296 --> 13:50.862
- That's half the clientele
at duffy's.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.230
- Well, that's good then,
you've narrowed down

13:52.232 --> 13:53.231
The list of suspects.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.933
Hey, tommy, cover me.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.467
Good afternoon, ladies.
What's up?

13:56.469 --> 13:58.903
You want a tour
of district 21?

13:58.905 --> 14:00.271
I'd be delighted.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.140
Has anybody here
heard of al capone?

14:02.142 --> 14:03.274
- He was here?

14:03.276 --> 14:05.009
- Everybody was here.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.611
Let's go.

14:09.582 --> 14:12.317
- To be perfectly honest, doc,
I'm pretty thrilled

14:12.319 --> 14:15.053
You give me
a him-or-me choice,

14:15.055 --> 14:19.123
I'm gonna make it
the same way every time.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.092
- People can feel conflicted
about something,

14:21.094 --> 14:22.126
Even if it is justified.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.528
- Well, I'm not, doc.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.030
I'm not.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.633
- What?
- Conflicted.

14:31.937 --> 14:33.538
- You are not married.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.340
Are you in a relationship?

14:35.342 --> 14:38.977
- Are you asking
me out, doc?

14:38.979 --> 14:44.249
She's my fiancee
as of about a month ago.

14:44.251 --> 14:48.620
- How does she feel about
what you've been through?

14:48.622 --> 14:53.324
- I haven't told her.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.426
- Most of us
at one time or another

14:55.428 --> 14:57.595
Meet challenges
that we can't explain.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.297
- Just--
[sighs]

14:59.299 --> 15:01.232
Are you trying
to make me feel bad?

15:01.234 --> 15:03.635
Is that what
you want to hear?

15:03.637 --> 15:05.470
- Not at all.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.106
- Okay, are we done?

15:08.108 --> 15:11.609
- I would like for you to take
the rest of the shift off.

15:15.114 --> 15:17.282
- My mother always called it
"murder city."

15:17.284 --> 15:22.120
But the first time we visited,
I fell in love with chicago.

15:22.122 --> 15:24.389
The lake, the river walk.

15:24.391 --> 15:29.193
George and I went to the top
of the willis tower.

15:29.195 --> 15:33.998
God, I just--
I can't believe it.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.969
Why would someone
kill my husband?

15:37.971 --> 15:40.305
- We think that he was
smuggling guns into the country.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.075
- George?

15:44.077 --> 15:46.210
- He wasn't killed
over insulin.

15:46.212 --> 15:47.545
And on his last trip here,
we think

15:47.547 --> 15:50.415
His vehicle was filled
with these.

15:53.185 --> 15:55.253
- I'm hallucinating.
This isn't happening.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.955
- Five people have already been
killed by them.

15:56.957 --> 16:00.258
- Look, you don't get it.
George would never do that ever.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.627
- How often did you make
the trip down with him?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.329
- Every couple of months.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.130
We always stay
at the sofitel.

16:06.132 --> 16:09.133
I shop.
That's why he dropped me off.

16:09.135 --> 16:12.570
They don't have bloomingdale's
in canada.

16:17.076 --> 16:20.411
- What do you say, maurice?

16:20.413 --> 16:23.114
- It's all good.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.750
- You hear anything about
lone guns coming in to town?

16:25.752 --> 16:28.419
- What kind?
- Sprayers. A lot of 'em.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.355
- Heard about something
from canada.

16:30.357 --> 16:32.323
That doesn't make
a lot of sense.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.192
- It's starting to.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.127
You hear anything,
hit me up.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.129
Another thing.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.464
I've been getting some static
from this cat

16:39.466 --> 16:41.199
Named trayzell
with the gds.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.500
You know anybody
got his ear?

16:42.502 --> 16:44.102
- Trayzell's?
- Mm.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.269
- No.

16:45.271 --> 16:46.504
He's stone crazy.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.674
He don't listen to nobody.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.577
And I need to bring you
in on something.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.580
State's attorney's getting
someone to flip on me,

16:55.582 --> 16:58.182
Buildin' a case or somethin'.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.018
- I haven't got wind
of anything.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.587
- Now you have.

17:02.589 --> 17:06.223
Five stacks.

17:06.226 --> 17:09.761
More when you get me
that name.

17:09.762 --> 17:13.064
- I got you.

17:16.167 --> 17:17.268
Go for voight.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.369
- We got somethin'.

17:41.326 --> 17:42.827
- These are our bullets.

17:42.829 --> 17:44.529
- Can you believe the velocity
of these things?

17:44.531 --> 17:47.265
Forensics traced one round
that went through the tv,

17:47.267 --> 17:48.633
Through the wall,
ended up halfway

17:48.635 --> 17:49.700
Through the engine block
of an ice cream truck

17:49.702 --> 17:50.701
Parked across the street.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.370
- Seven homicides and counting.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.272
- Our widow's lying.

17:54.274 --> 17:57.308
Her cell phone provider said
she was never at bloomingdale's.

17:57.310 --> 18:01.379
She spent the afternoon
up in edgewater.

18:07.519 --> 18:11.656
We're gonna get real honest
real quick.

18:19.432 --> 18:22.533
- Oh, god.
- Yeah, neither can we.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.535
His face was shot off
by the bullets

18:24.537 --> 18:26.170
You and your husband
brought into chicago.

18:26.172 --> 18:29.273
- Why are you doing this?
- You lied to us.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.441
You weren't
browsing bloomingdale's.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.577
You were in edgewater.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.412
You and your husband
had a nice run, right?

18:34.414 --> 18:37.181
You start off with something
simple like x or kush,

18:37.183 --> 18:39.350
And you got greedy,
and you upgraded to gun-running.

18:39.352 --> 18:40.485
You got george killed,
which makes you

18:40.487 --> 18:42.120
An accessory to his murder.

18:42.122 --> 18:45.857
- So we're gonna try this again,
only this time the truth.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.596
- I was visiting a friend.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.731
An ex-boyfriend.
- If you're gonna lie,

18:53.733 --> 18:55.166
Put some effort into it
for me.

18:55.168 --> 18:59.570
- Call him.
He'll tell you.

19:03.509 --> 19:06.611
- Name, number.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.589
- I want you to take me
through your entire day,

19:18.591 --> 19:22.226
Every stop you made,
every person you talked to,

19:22.228 --> 19:23.594
Everything you did.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.296
- I already told you.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.331
- Tell me again.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.499
- [sighs]

19:28.501 --> 19:29.834
We were on the road
by 4:30.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.170
Didn't stop
till we crossed the border

19:32.172 --> 19:36.707
Got some coffee, some gas.
Used the washroom.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.543
George got a phone call
from our nephew--

19:38.545 --> 19:40.378
- Who's the nephew?
- He lives here.

19:40.380 --> 19:43.514
He likes to meet up
with george--

19:43.516 --> 19:47.418
Oh, god, mikey doesn't know.

19:47.420 --> 19:50.588
- Does mikey
have a last name?

19:50.590 --> 19:53.624
Michael ganz,
lives in east garfield park,

19:53.626 --> 19:55.693
Has a record:
Robbery, possession.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.728
Runs with a small crew.

19:57.730 --> 19:58.763
- Claire's ex-boyfriend
checks out

19:58.765 --> 20:00.231
Right down
to the 500 bucks.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.666
- Got a ping
on ganz's phone,

20:01.668 --> 20:02.833
Pulled all the numbers
he's called

20:02.835 --> 20:04.402
In the last 24 hours.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.603
- [applauds]
employee of the week,

20:05.605 --> 20:08.639
Jin, right here.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.775
- All the calls
were to the same numbers,

20:10.777 --> 20:13.744
A cell phone registered
to a lucky m pawn and loan

20:13.746 --> 20:15.379
In gage park.
- Lucky m.

20:15.381 --> 20:16.714
I know that ding-dong.

20:16.716 --> 20:20.351
We'll go talk to him.
Come on.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.552
- Hey, o.
- Yeah.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.355
- I'm gonna need you later
off the books.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.557
- Yeah.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.392
- Let's go.
- Come on.

20:32.631 --> 20:33.497
Mr. Milner.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.932
- Alvin.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.634
- Hey.
So how's the usury business?

20:36.636 --> 20:37.702
- [chuckles]

20:37.704 --> 20:39.971
I don't run
that kind of operation.

20:39.973 --> 20:42.607
- Good for you.

20:42.609 --> 20:47.411
So, um, guns
coming in from canada.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.247
- I just introduce people.
- [laughs]

20:49.249 --> 20:51.682
Wha--wha--
what does that mean?

20:51.684 --> 20:53.651
- Nothin'.
I'm just telling you, you know?

20:53.653 --> 20:54.852
- No, I don't know.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.621
- I don't know anything
about canadian guns.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.489
- Then why did you say,
"I just introduce people"?

20:58.491 --> 21:02.893
It just seems odd.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.662
- You make me nervous.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.564
- Why? Huh?

21:06.566 --> 21:12.903
You took a nine iron
to my jewelry case.

21:12.905 --> 21:15.539
- That was here?
- Alvin.

21:15.541 --> 21:19.844
I don't know anything, okay?

21:23.049 --> 21:28.786
Right there, right there.
Right--right over there, yeah.

21:31.056 --> 21:35.459
He set up a buy
with ganz tomorrow, 2:00 p.M.

21:50.842 --> 21:53.377
[knocking on door]

22:06.091 --> 22:09.627
- Hey, danny.

22:09.629 --> 22:10.961
- Hi, jay.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.630
- Pastrami for danny,

22:12.632 --> 22:15.533
And smoked turkey for you.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.768
- Oh, gosh.

22:17.770 --> 22:20.004
We're going to be eating this
till thanksgiving.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.572
Hey, let me get you
a sandwich.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.074
- No, I can't.
I gotta run.

22:23.076 --> 22:27.378
- Oh, well, let me at least
give you a slice of cake to go.

22:30.449 --> 22:34.485
- [sighs]

22:38.390 --> 22:41.826
- This is always a tough day
for him.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.362
He won't eat it.

22:44.364 --> 22:47.465
I just end up
throwing it out.

22:50.635 --> 22:52.770
- Small slice.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.666
- Can I see
your driver's license?

23:22.668 --> 23:25.102
- Halstead. Intelligence.
- This is harassment.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.405
- Just eating
some birthday cake.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.672
Today would have been
a birthday.

23:28.674 --> 23:30.141
- Arrest him.

23:30.143 --> 23:31.609
Get him out of here!
- Sorry, pal.

23:31.611 --> 23:34.145
- All you dirty bastards
stick together.

23:34.147 --> 23:35.546
You always have.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.515
- Seven years ago
today, lonnie.

23:37.517 --> 23:40.851
- Get outta here!
- Seven years!

23:40.853 --> 23:43.087
He would have been 15!

23:43.089 --> 23:45.189
- I'm gonna call my lawyer.
I'm getting a restraining order.

23:45.191 --> 23:46.557
- I'm gonna give you a reason
to need one one day.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.559
Oh, god.

23:48.561 --> 23:52.997
You and your sick-ass son.

24:03.875 --> 24:06.177
- Okay.
I got nothin' on the guns.

24:06.179 --> 24:07.711
Sorry.

24:07.713 --> 24:09.447
- That's it?

24:09.449 --> 24:12.149
Next time, text me.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.984
- And also, my date canceled
for tomorrow,

24:13.986 --> 24:17.488
So you're on.

24:17.490 --> 24:21.192
What do you want me
to wear?

24:21.194 --> 24:22.860
- Dress conservative.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.195
Repeat that back to me.

24:24.197 --> 24:27.498
- I will dress conservative.

24:29.701 --> 24:32.136
- Ciao amore at 7:00.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.737
- Okay.

24:33.739 --> 24:35.239
See you then.

24:37.709 --> 24:40.811
[knocks on door]

24:47.519 --> 24:48.519
- Severide. Hey.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.588
- Hey, um,

24:50.590 --> 24:52.122
I didn't know
where else to go,

24:52.124 --> 24:55.860
And, um, and I don't--

24:55.862 --> 24:57.528
No one's heard anything.

24:57.530 --> 25:00.097
I don't know
what to do.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.899
- Hey, we're gonna
find her, okay?

25:01.901 --> 25:04.034
- Yeah.
- I promise.

25:04.036 --> 25:06.604
We've got really good guys
on this.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.906
And I know it's scary,
and I know your sister's alone,

25:08.908 --> 25:11.609
But we're gonna find her.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.115
- [cries]

25:52.551 --> 25:55.219
- [moaning]

25:55.221 --> 25:57.988

25:57.990 --> 26:01.325

26:14.673 --> 26:15.940

26:20.780 --> 26:24.148

26:24.150 --> 26:27.117
- Bro.
- [moans]

26:27.119 --> 26:29.219
- I came to you man to man,
tried to do business.

26:29.221 --> 26:31.956
You want to negotiate?

26:31.958 --> 26:34.224
Maybe casper didn't tell you
before he got sent up,

26:34.226 --> 26:37.161
But I don't like negotiating.

26:37.163 --> 26:40.264
Maybe he didn't tell you,
I make offers once.

26:42.734 --> 26:46.003
- [screams]

26:46.005 --> 26:48.172
[groans]

26:48.174 --> 26:50.040
- You can uncuff him.

26:50.042 --> 26:52.977
- [groans]

26:58.683 --> 27:01.285
- Ah!
- Ooh.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.221
- [groans]

27:04.223 --> 27:06.323
- Look at me.

27:06.325 --> 27:09.093
D'anthony is out

27:09.095 --> 27:12.162
As of this minute.

27:12.164 --> 27:15.866
You're goin' on a ride
you're never coming back from.

27:15.868 --> 27:19.903
You understand?

27:19.905 --> 27:22.006
All right.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.174
Let's get outta here.

27:24.176 --> 27:27.277
- [groans]

27:32.083 --> 27:33.150
- Let's keep our heads down.

27:33.152 --> 27:37.087
Assume mike is packing
heavy stuff.

27:37.089 --> 27:38.088
- Hey.
- Look at you

27:38.090 --> 27:39.223
All fresh like a daisy.

27:39.225 --> 27:40.724
- Yeah, what a wank.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.393
Hey, listen, any word
on the guy I dropped?

27:42.395 --> 27:44.828
- Nah, still in the icu.
- All right.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.030
- Hey, what'd
your counselor say?

27:46.032 --> 27:48.098
- Oh, that I'm coping well
with the trauma,

27:48.100 --> 27:50.100
But I think she was talking
about working with you.

27:50.102 --> 27:51.301
- You're in the van.

27:51.303 --> 27:54.138
- 'cause antonio called shotgun
before you did.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.739
- You gotta be--
al, how long

27:55.741 --> 27:57.274
Is this gonna go on for?
I'm fine.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.109
- Christmas.
- What?

27:59.111 --> 28:03.147
- Christmas is
the takedown word.

28:03.149 --> 28:05.215
- Hey.

28:05.217 --> 28:08.819
Reservation's all set
at carmine's for when he's out.

28:08.821 --> 28:11.188
So who do you want me
to invite?

28:11.190 --> 28:13.190
- Oh, let's keep it small,
just the three of us.

28:13.192 --> 28:17.828
He should be around
his old friends just yet.

28:17.830 --> 28:20.931
- Okay.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.876
- That's our boy, ganz.

28:35.146 --> 28:37.848
- Milner says you're huntin'
for hardware?

28:37.850 --> 28:40.050
- If they're the quality
milner said they are,

28:40.052 --> 28:44.021
We'll take most of 'em
off your hands.

28:44.023 --> 28:45.723
- I'll take you to it.

28:45.725 --> 28:48.192
Get in.
- Aw, come on.

28:48.194 --> 28:51.161
- Only one of you
with the money.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.730
- Forget it.

28:52.732 --> 28:54.064
- Fine with me.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.466
- Hey, hey--whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait--wait a sec.

28:55.468 --> 28:57.868
Wait--wait--wait a sec.

28:57.870 --> 28:59.169
Okay.
- No.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.238
- All right.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.141
He's a cupcake.

29:04.143 --> 29:05.976
[engine starts]

29:05.978 --> 29:09.747
- We're goin' mobile.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.918
- What's your name?
- What do you care?

29:14.920 --> 29:17.921
- We're heading north.

29:17.923 --> 29:20.958
Heard you had a--
a crew.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.093
- Well, you'll meet 'em
soon enough.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.062
- What's wrong?

29:27.165 --> 29:31.535
- We've lost his audio
and his tracking beacon.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.470
- We're headin' into mccook.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.239
- Why do you keep
calling out directions?

29:35.241 --> 29:38.142
- I'm in a car with some guy
I never met.

29:38.144 --> 29:41.912
You know, he's taking me
to an undisclosed location.

29:41.914 --> 29:45.115
You know, I'm just thinkin'
out loud.

29:45.117 --> 29:49.253
- Pull over.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.255
Give me your phone.

29:51.257 --> 29:54.158
- I'm not wired.

29:54.160 --> 29:57.227
- Do it.

29:57.229 --> 29:58.929
Open the door,
and you die.

29:58.931 --> 30:03.167
- This is so, so dumb.

30:07.172 --> 30:11.241
- Okay.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.844
- I want you to look at
the mile marker and make a note.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.813
- Why's that?
- Once the deal is done,

30:15.815 --> 30:18.816
You're gonna bring me back here
so I can look for that phone.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.017
- How closely
can you track him, jin?

30:20.019 --> 30:21.819
- Six meters.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.121
Yards, whatever.

30:48.279 --> 30:50.147
- Let's see the money.

30:50.149 --> 30:53.283
- 25 large.

30:53.285 --> 30:57.154
I left the other half
with my associate.

30:57.156 --> 31:01.959
You really think I'll come alone
with all the cash?

31:01.961 --> 31:06.530
Well, let's see
the damn guns.

31:12.937 --> 31:14.872
Ooh.

31:14.874 --> 31:17.975
Look at that.

31:24.115 --> 31:27.284
It's just like
christmas morning.

31:27.286 --> 31:29.286
[loud crash]
- cops.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.521
- Police!

31:31.523 --> 31:34.358
[gunfire]

31:54.279 --> 31:56.580
- Move!

31:56.582 --> 31:59.416
[gunfire]

31:59.418 --> 32:18.568
.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.637
[gunfire]

32:22.407 --> 32:26.209
- Put the gun down!

32:26.211 --> 32:28.278
I will drop you,
I swear to god.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.281
Put it down.

32:31.283 --> 32:33.617
Get on the ground.
Put your palms in the air.

32:33.619 --> 32:36.186
Get down.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.187
O?

32:37.189 --> 32:41.358
[sirens wailing]

32:41.360 --> 32:44.161
- Burgess, atwater,
you got two white male offenders

32:44.163 --> 32:48.165
Moving southwest of the building
towards you.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.599
- You all right?

32:49.601 --> 32:52.336
- Yeah.

32:52.338 --> 32:53.737
Hey.

32:53.739 --> 32:56.540
The radio was in
my belt buckle, slick.

32:56.542 --> 32:58.608
See?

32:58.610 --> 33:01.111
Just so when
you're in gen pop

33:01.113 --> 33:03.547
Telling your story,

33:03.549 --> 33:05.415
You get your details straight.

33:10.455 --> 33:12.222
Hey.

33:12.224 --> 33:14.124
Well, that got crazy fast.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.325
- Didn't I tell you
he was a cupcake?

33:15.327 --> 33:16.660
[cell phone vibrates]

33:16.662 --> 33:18.996
[indistinct chatter]

33:21.599 --> 33:25.002
- Aw...

33:25.004 --> 33:27.170
I gotta take care
of something.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.638
- Don't say that.

33:28.640 --> 33:31.308
- Tell justin
something popped up.

33:31.310 --> 33:34.444
- Are you kidding me?

33:39.150 --> 33:41.151
- Just do this
for me, okay?

33:41.153 --> 33:43.086
Thank you.
- No.

33:43.088 --> 33:44.554
You're telling me
that whatever you have going on

33:44.556 --> 33:46.590
Is more important
than seeing your only son

33:46.592 --> 33:49.526
Walk out of the gates?
- Yes.

33:49.528 --> 33:53.797
Tell justin I love him
and I'll see him tomorrow.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.105
- That's your third.

34:02.107 --> 34:05.108
- Still one short of getting me
through this evening.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.518
Jasmine.

34:15.521 --> 34:18.054
- What the hell?

34:18.056 --> 34:19.656
- My wife wanted
to meet you.

34:19.658 --> 34:21.091
- So why didn't
you say something?

34:21.092 --> 34:22.726
- You would never have come.

34:22.728 --> 34:26.797
- You're right.

34:26.799 --> 34:30.600
- Jasmine, laura.
Laura, jasmine.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.601
- Hi. It's--it's nice
to finally meet you.

34:32.603 --> 34:35.237
- Look mrs. Dawson,
I get it, okay?

34:35.239 --> 34:38.442
Nobody wants their husband
to hang out with someone like--

34:38.444 --> 34:39.810
Like me,
but you know what?

34:39.812 --> 34:41.244
Let me tell you
something, okay?

34:41.246 --> 34:43.146
I got no designs on him,
and he's got none on me,

34:43.148 --> 34:45.549
So if we're done with
this little face-to-face...

34:45.551 --> 34:49.386
- Wait.
Just wait.

34:53.491 --> 34:55.759
I wanted
to give you this.

35:07.538 --> 35:10.474
It's, uh, it's st. Nicholas,

35:10.476 --> 35:13.643
The patron saint of children.

35:16.881 --> 35:20.183
You helped
save our son's life.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.355
I just wanted
to thank you personally.

35:27.291 --> 35:29.893
- Why didn't you tell me this
is why you wanted to see her?

35:29.895 --> 35:33.130
- 'cause you wouldn't
have brought her.

35:37.235 --> 35:40.504
- Nobody's wife
has ever thanked me before.

35:43.307 --> 35:44.641
- Come on.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.744
Sit down.

35:53.184 --> 35:55.652
[laughter]
- good evening, ladies.

36:00.626 --> 36:04.661
- You take one photo
and post this on facebook,

36:04.663 --> 36:06.163
I will destroy you.

36:06.165 --> 36:09.633
- Copy that.
- Good.

36:09.635 --> 36:11.234
All right, let's do this.
[cheering]

36:11.236 --> 36:14.404
[laughs]
- have a good night.

36:18.376 --> 36:19.643
Pop!

36:19.645 --> 36:22.712
[indistinct chatter]

36:22.714 --> 36:24.314
- Hi.

36:27.485 --> 36:31.354
- All right, well,
I appreciate the phone call.

36:31.356 --> 36:35.859
[clears throat]

36:35.861 --> 36:38.862
Hey, baby.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.530
- Who's on the phone?

36:40.532 --> 36:43.533
- Uh, that was, um...

36:43.535 --> 36:46.636
- Adam.

36:46.638 --> 36:47.704
- All right, look,
listen, I wanted

36:47.706 --> 36:49.639
To bring you in
on somethin', okay?

36:49.641 --> 36:51.441
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:51.443 --> 36:52.909
Um, they didn't
pull me out

36:52.911 --> 36:55.445
Of the academy
to do paperwork.

36:55.447 --> 36:59.549
They pulled me out
to work in intelligence.

37:03.554 --> 37:08.291
I'm sorry.

37:08.293 --> 37:10.527
- It's a good thing,
isn't it?

37:10.529 --> 37:11.595
- Yeah, like
you wouldn't believe.

37:11.597 --> 37:12.829
It's awesome.

37:12.831 --> 37:15.232
There's guys
with 10 years on the job

37:15.234 --> 37:16.600
That are still trying
to give their left nut

37:16.602 --> 37:17.601
To be in this unit.

37:17.603 --> 37:21.538
- Well, what was
the phone call?

37:21.540 --> 37:24.374
- I was in
a shooting yesterday.

37:24.376 --> 37:25.775
- What?

37:25.777 --> 37:27.277
- It's all right.
- Oh my god, what happened?

37:27.279 --> 37:30.647
- Well, the guy
that I shot

37:30.649 --> 37:33.516
Who was trying
to kill me,

37:33.518 --> 37:36.620
He died,
and that was the hospital.

37:39.757 --> 37:41.658
- Are you messin' with me
right now?

37:41.660 --> 37:44.694
- No.
I'm not messing with you.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.496
I just wanted to tell you
in case

37:46.498 --> 37:48.331
I'm a little distracted tonight,
which I won't be

37:48.333 --> 37:50.000
Because I'm totally fine, okay?

37:50.002 --> 37:51.701
Hey, look at me.

37:51.703 --> 37:54.304
I'm fine.
It's all fine.

37:54.306 --> 37:57.707
Now, come make me
look pretty.

37:57.709 --> 37:59.576
Let's go mingle.
- Adam.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.911
How can you be fine?

38:04.949 --> 38:06.816
- I don't know.
I just am.

38:10.488 --> 38:11.588
All right.

38:11.590 --> 38:15.925
Well, listen,
I need a drink.

38:25.703 --> 38:27.871
- Freedom!

38:27.873 --> 38:30.573
- [laughs]
- whoo.

38:30.575 --> 38:33.610
Gentlemen, it's been nice.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.745
Oh! Ah.

38:37.648 --> 38:40.483
- It's good
to see you, justin.

38:40.485 --> 38:43.720
Aw, hi.

38:43.722 --> 38:47.390
- Damn, you are lookin' good.
- Get outta here.

38:47.392 --> 38:48.758
A goat would look good to you
right now.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.760
- Yeah, maybe.

38:50.762 --> 38:53.697
So where's my old man?

38:53.699 --> 38:56.833
- He had to take care
of something.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.601
- Why am I not surprised
by that?

38:58.603 --> 38:59.703
- Come on, he's working.

38:59.705 --> 39:02.572
- Yeah, he's always working.

39:02.574 --> 39:03.973
Whatever, I don't care.

39:03.975 --> 39:05.742
I just wanted
to see you anyways.

39:05.744 --> 39:08.745
- All right.
Let's go get you a hot meal--

39:08.747 --> 39:11.414
Whoa.

39:11.416 --> 39:13.750
Whoa, what the hell
was that?

39:13.752 --> 39:16.720
- Hey, I'm not
that snot-nosed kid anymore.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.588
I'll prove it
to you, okay?

39:18.590 --> 39:20.724
Come on.
Let's go.

39:20.726 --> 39:21.858
You want me to drive,
or do you want to drive?

39:21.860 --> 39:24.961
- Get in the car.

39:27.031 --> 39:30.033
- When are we taking
maurice down?

39:30.035 --> 39:31.468
Let me rephrase that.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.070
We need to take
maurice down.

39:34.072 --> 39:35.805
- I will.

39:35.807 --> 39:37.607
Two weeks max.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.442
- Two weeks from today?
- Two weeks from today.

39:39.444 --> 39:40.910
- Uh-uh.
Uh-uh.

39:40.912 --> 39:45.515
Nice try.
Where is the money?

39:45.517 --> 39:47.050
Maurice gives you 5,000 a week.
Where is it?

39:47.052 --> 39:48.918
- He didn't have it.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.054
- That's funny

39:51.056 --> 39:53.390
'cause my intel
said he's stacked.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.658
- Maybe you should be meeting
your intel here and not me.

39:55.660 --> 40:00.530
- Hank.

40:00.532 --> 40:04.167
If I find out
you're lying to me,

40:04.169 --> 40:07.470
I will bury you.

40:18.616 --> 40:22.552
- You're gonna be
all right, partner.

40:22.554 --> 40:25.722
- I just--I don't know.

40:28.626 --> 40:29.726
How do you know
I won't screw this up

40:29.728 --> 40:32.629
And she makes me
come back?

40:32.631 --> 40:35.031
- Two reasons.

40:35.033 --> 40:38.435
One, because I know
you're a good kid,

40:38.437 --> 40:41.771
And two, because you know
if you do screw up,

40:41.773 --> 40:45.575
I'm driving all the way there
to kick your ass.

40:53.951 --> 40:56.085
- Look at you,
all grown up.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.787
[laughs]

40:57.789 --> 40:59.689
- Hey, aunt shona.

40:59.691 --> 41:02.025
- Hank voight.
- Shona williams.

41:02.027 --> 41:03.793
Nice to meet you.

41:03.795 --> 41:08.097
- Here, to help cover costs.

41:08.099 --> 41:10.467
- I can't take this.

41:10.469 --> 41:14.771
Gets his appetite back, that
will barely cover breakfast.

41:18.509 --> 41:19.676
- That's very nice of you.

41:19.678 --> 41:22.812
Thank you.

41:32.756 --> 41:34.958
