Now you've got to get them
to take them off.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.636
The jeans have
all the power.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.804
Because you
gave it to them!

19:31.838 --> 19:33.139
Now take it back.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.509
Women of Langley,
I used to think jeans

19:36.543 --> 19:38.411
were the most important thing
in the world,

19:38.445 --> 19:41.314
that they made me worthy,
beautiful, lovable.

19:41.348 --> 19:47.153
Am I still now all these things
even without the jeans?

19:47.186 --> 19:50.757
Sure, but you're still
wearing them a little bit.

[ Grunting ]

19:53.293 --> 19:55.328
I should have taken
my shoes off first.

19:55.362 --> 19:59.499
I didn't realize it,
but I gave my power away

19:59.532 --> 20:03.270
to the jeans, something that
we are women should never do,

20:03.303 --> 20:06.072
because when we give jeans
too much power,

20:06.105 --> 20:07.840
they end up
controlling us.

20:07.874 --> 20:10.510
Really go for it, Francine.
You can't hurt me.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.345
Aaaah,
it hurts so much!

20:12.379 --> 20:13.680
You're breaking my feet!

[ Grunts ]

20:15.047 --> 20:17.183
Find a supportive friend,

20:17.216 --> 20:20.720
and get out
of those damn jeans.

20:20.753 --> 20:21.921
They're doing it!

20:21.954 --> 20:24.056
They're free
of the jeans!

It's just like the dream,
how it all started.

20:36.403 --> 20:39.806
Jeans, do you have
a message for us?

20:39.839 --> 20:43.376
Jeans:
Confidence is sexy.

20:44.844 --> 20:49.549
That giant talking pair
of jeans is worth millions!

20:49.582 --> 20:52.018
Get it, boys!

20:55.755 --> 20:57.424
Sorry, jeans.

You belong to
the boy's club now.
