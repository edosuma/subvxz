00:48.425 --> 00:51.809
Honey .... What are you doing?

01:01.729 --> 01:04.039
What do you honey? Will you be a lawyer?

01:04.040 --> 01:07.439
It will be .... doctor.

01:19.461 --> 01:22.679
It is either going to be a doctor, so we know

01:22.691 --> 01:25.569
it will be smart, like his father.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.355
And it gets as, What does that mean, you know ...?

01:58.356 --> 02:00.257
And then you can not take it anymore ....

02:00.258 --> 02:05.563
He says, shit! in America "High Troll." It means "Forward, forward"

02:05.824 --> 02:08.631
Then, the next day he will play golf with your partner ...

02:23.268 --> 02:24.597
Viola

02:25.985 --> 02:27.583
Are you ready?

02:27.584 --> 02:28.584
And

02:28.706 --> 02:30.213
Is everything packed?

02:30.214 --> 02:32.043
Yes I think so...

02:32.044 --> 02:33.290
Wait.

02:34.614 --> 02:37.125
I gave the keys to Hant, so ...

02:37.126 --> 02:39.011
the fish care.

02:41.701 --> 02:44.416
I do not like when he's here ...

02:44.733 --> 02:46.490
and we are not here.

02:51.987 --> 02:54.359
Honey if you want it I can ask return the keys but ....

02:54.360 --> 02:55.793
we will have to take the fish to the camp.

02:55.794 --> 02:57.523
I do not like this.

02:59.460 --> 03:03.885
- You want me to ask for the keys? - No, leave it, do not say anything.

03:04.480 --> 03:05.936
As you wish.

03:07.846 --> 03:09.670
We do not want to think I'm an idiot.

03:09.671 --> 03:12.279
I think it's too late for that.

03:12.514 --> 03:14.603
And it is reciprocal.

03:15.745 --> 03:18.498
Do not prejudge, it is a good guy.

03:21.784 --> 03:25.147
Do I have to remember what he did on New Year?

03:27.145 --> 03:29.421
Come on, he was drunk.

03:30.971 --> 03:33.710
We all go a little crazy ....

03:36.847 --> 03:39.074
We lose the head.

03:48.830 --> 03:52.545
But he was the only one who undressed in front of your aunt.

03:52.546 --> 03:55.318
I assure you that she did not care.

04:14.025 --> 04:16.202
Let's go?

04:21.495 --> 04:22.924
When you return exactly?

04:23.394 --> 04:27.091
Just to know, with all parties that will I do at home ....

04:27.329 --> 04:29.266
Everything is already organized ....

04:30.000 --> 04:33.988
There will be strippers, beer galore, wild orgies ....

04:33.989 --> 04:36.391
People ready to throw in all rooms ....

04:36.392 --> 04:38.787
Well, the perfect party.

04:53.635 --> 04:55.470
We are very grateful for your help.

04:55.847 --> 04:59.310
Look at what conditions you find your house when you get back, before thanking.

05:10.476 --> 05:13.236
This is the sound of the biggest mistake of their lives ....

05:14.118 --> 05:15.969
Take care of popsicles.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.069
Portate bien.

05:51.392 --> 05:54.539
Just we need to lighten up a bit ....

05:55.552 --> 05:58.404
I promise you'll have fun ....

06:03.015 --> 06:05.181
Honey, look at me ....

06:05.182 --> 06:07.959
what happened was not our fault ....

06:10.401 --> 06:12.808
I just want to see you happy, right?

06:16.439 --> 06:18.403
Agree.

06:39.817 --> 06:43.266
Can you stop the car? I need a break.

06:44.135 --> 06:45.555
Now?

06:46.415 --> 06:48.689
Do I have to spell it?

06:49.912 --> 06:52.750
We arrive in 10 minutes.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.456
I need to pee.

06:57.480 --> 06:58.742
Good.

07:09.749 --> 07:11.156
Where are you going?

07:24.039 --> 07:25.039
Shit.

08:16.181 --> 08:19.410
Damn, shit.

10:15.759 --> 10:19.639
- You scared me, holy God. - You lost the car?

10:31.911 --> 10:33.892
Are you sure you were not looking for me?

10:33.893 --> 10:37.239
Not because? Something happened?

10:40.190 --> 10:41.662
You can tell me.

10:41.926 --> 10:44.144
I'm glad you're here for me ....

10:44.145 --> 10:48.466
I just needed some fresh air, I do not want him to hide ....

10:49.287 --> 10:54.047
It is not easy for me, put me in mood weekend ....

10:54.876 --> 10:57.243
But I promise I'll try.

10:57.244 --> 11:01.504
Forces do not want you to do something you do not feel.

11:02.427 --> 11:04.363
Thank you.

11:06.650 --> 11:08.189
Come on?

12:43.260 --> 12:44.340
You like?

12:44.341 --> 12:46.450
Yes, it's cute.

12:48.406 --> 12:52.894
My uncle comes here to make wine ....

12:53.955 --> 12:58.946
and there is a beautiful winery back, so you know what that means?

13:00.286 --> 13:03.621
Good wine, the whole weekend.

13:16.602 --> 13:17.602
'Put me down !!

13:23.965 --> 13:25.213
Are you crazy.

13:25.214 --> 13:27.161
Crazy for You.

13:49.388 --> 13:51.174
It's cold here.

13:51.175 --> 13:54.539
Yes, I will turn the caloventor.

14:41.526 --> 14:43.196
That was my mother.

14:44.725 --> 14:46.926
I never showed any photo.

14:48.577 --> 14:50.887
I never meant to keep them ....

14:52.322 --> 14:57.157
She died when she was having me.

15:10.111 --> 15:12.313
I have a surprise for you....

15:13.321 --> 15:14.506
wait.

15:31.381 --> 15:34.478
I'll take care of your dinner tonight.

15:36.047 --> 15:38.189
As a true chef.

15:38.574 --> 15:42.958
I read almost all the cookbook, so I hope to remember something.

15:43.285 --> 15:45.379
What do you want me to do?

15:45.380 --> 15:47.137
Nothing.

17:52.430 --> 17:54.308
You caught me.

17:59.654 --> 18:01.696
Are not you going to quit?

18:01.697 --> 18:03.881
Many times....

18:04.204 --> 18:06.202
I'm not starting again ....

18:06.892 --> 18:08.812
I just need this.

18:19.048 --> 18:20.730
Listen out....

18:21.713 --> 18:26.364
before I ... - Only for treating me like a porcelain doll.

18:28.519 --> 18:30.207
You're right....

18:31.578 --> 18:32.786
I am sorry.

18:44.057 --> 18:46.193
Does anyone ever come here?

18:48.860 --> 18:53.478
My uncle, but he has not appeared for years.

18:56.940 --> 18:59.735
Simply I can not stay without doing anything.

19:01.465 --> 19:04.054
Well, if you want....

19:04.499 --> 19:10.047
you can go to get some water from the well, it is there ....

19:10.724 --> 19:12.327
down the road ....

19:14.774 --> 19:15.868
And?

22:11.194 --> 22:14.784
I'm following your marks but I have not found anything yet.

22:19.050 --> 22:21.921
I should be out there, it is where I left off.

22:44.756 --> 22:47.548
Here we go, I found a ....

22:54.239 --> 22:55.691
I found it.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.355
Smells good?

23:03.932 --> 23:08.897
Do not you removed the guts, you are the real animal.

23:09.470 --> 23:13.475
And ruin the best part of your weekend? What kind of friend would?

23:13.476 --> 23:16.585
2 days, and left for 2 days.

23:17.236 --> 23:23.062
Well, your weekly report please remember to remark that this was the 5th time.

23:27.259 --> 23:29.623
Make sure you're not the sixth ...

23:29.624 --> 23:30.948
Over and out.

24:49.189 --> 24:53.281
Just take your time, I'll go talk to her husband.

24:54.303 --> 24:55.303
No.

25:26.365 --> 25:29.310
I guess still out there looking for her ....

25:29.823 --> 25:33.276
I think it's better than both wait here until you return.

25:33.580 --> 25:37.333
I prefer to explain what happened to me on my own ....

25:38.156 --> 25:40.649
it's embarrassing, do not imagine it.

25:41.345 --> 25:43.855
You do not be ashamed to pass out.

25:48.967 --> 25:50.823
I'll do whatever you want.

25:53.605 --> 25:54.901
Viola...

26:00.874 --> 26:02.704
My God, are you okay? ....

26:03.089 --> 26:04.606
You're good?

26:05.435 --> 26:07.709
There is nothing to worry about....

26:08.103 --> 26:10.197
She had a low pressure ....

26:10.198 --> 26:12.957
when I found her, she was unconscious and weak ....

26:12.958 --> 26:15.688
He asked me to bring her home immediately.

26:16.600 --> 26:19.121
I've been looking for several hours ...

26:19.122 --> 26:23.249
when I saw your car at the top of the hill, I returned immediately ....

26:23.998 --> 26:27.710
I thought something had happened.

26:28.359 --> 26:29.823
Everything is fine.

26:40.501 --> 26:43.033
I do not have enough thanks for your help.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.085
It is my duty.

26:48.749 --> 26:52.091
Are you sure you do not want to stay a while?

26:52.603 --> 26:53.929
No...

26:53.930 --> 26:58.395
during long shifts, I sleep in a shelter in the valley ...

26:59.914 --> 27:04.985
I precooked waiting for me there.

27:05.895 --> 27:09.281
Well, I am very grateful for your help.

27:14.211 --> 27:16.835
Take care of your wife ....

27:17.792 --> 27:21.671
CuÃ­dela, it something to eat ....

27:23.171 --> 27:26.056
At the shelter, I did not even want coffee.

27:26.057 --> 27:29.537
I thought you told me, that brought straight here.

27:29.749 --> 27:32.104
And and....

27:32.105 --> 27:34.023
it was just a minute ...

27:34.024 --> 27:36.446
I had to write the report ....

27:37.707 --> 27:40.065
Anyway, I have to go.

27:50.546 --> 27:52.031
Good job!

28:47.352 --> 28:51.127
If you want to go home .... I understand.

28:51.479 --> 28:54.823
No, I have only a little fatigue ...

28:56.535 --> 29:00.252
Believe me, this silly surrender by accident ....

29:00.253 --> 29:02.980
Only make me feel worse.

29:06.718 --> 29:09.205
Are you sure you feel good?

29:10.453 --> 29:12.723
We need this place ....

29:13.976 --> 29:16.736
I hate to admit it but ....

29:16.737 --> 29:21.640
The truth is that I love the way I care about.

29:31.092 --> 29:33.824
I do not know if I've told you before ....

29:35.433 --> 29:41.226
But after my parents' divorce ...

29:41.565 --> 29:44.106
I was about 9 or 10 ....

29:45.306 --> 29:51.750
And it was I who took care of Leo weekends ...

29:52.803 --> 29:55.468
You know, my stepbrother.

29:57.353 --> 30:00.023
It must not have been easy at that age.

30:00.345 --> 30:01.345
No.

30:03.210 --> 30:07.963
He had these attacks of rage ...

30:10.061 --> 30:14.627
And once, I .... I found it behind the house ....

30:14.628 --> 30:17.204
killing lizards ...

30:21.505 --> 30:26.265
The stabbing was on top of each other ....

30:26.516 --> 30:30.350
With their small bodies touching ...

30:32.004 --> 30:35.963
And the first time I catch him doing this ....

30:35.964 --> 30:39.321
Impulsively slapped him ...

30:42.778 --> 30:45.672
But he just kept smiling ....

30:47.333 --> 30:50.094
His eyes....

30:52.510 --> 30:57.986
When someone says that there is no violence in the eyes of a child ...

30:58.282 --> 31:02.415
They should have been at this time, because ....

31:02.416 --> 31:05.467
Throw the knife on the floor ...

31:06.352 --> 31:09.768
And he was staring at me ....

31:10.594 --> 31:12.232
Laughing...

31:13.783 --> 31:17.543
Almost threatening, you know ...?

31:20.762 --> 31:23.735
And then, you know what he told me?

31:23.736 --> 31:25.239
What?

31:26.597 --> 31:28.472
He said....

31:29.109 --> 31:32.259
"These are just lizards ...

31:32.841 --> 31:36.741
at least I did not kill my mother when I was born. "

31:39.520 --> 31:41.424
It's awful.

31:42.986 --> 31:45.905
Yeah ... so young.

31:46.210 --> 31:51.265
Not even ... like he knew about it.

31:54.430 --> 31:58.161
I lost the most important woman in my life ...

31:58.162 --> 32:01.169
Before getting to know and ...

32:02.382 --> 32:06.759
And I think I can not bear that to happen again.

32:08.018 --> 32:12.619
So that's why I just do the best I can ....

32:13.267 --> 32:16.216
Despite what happened to us ....

32:16.217 --> 32:19.088
What will happen to you.

32:44.123 --> 32:46.397
It's better if you rest.

32:47.098 --> 32:49.723
I love you so much.

33:10.171 --> 33:11.826
Nicola...

33:16.067 --> 33:17.940
Where are you?

33:37.216 --> 33:38.574
Viola...

33:42.355 --> 33:44.210
You will not believe.

33:47.713 --> 33:48.913
- Let's go now?

33:48.914 --> 33:51.089
If we have to hurry, come on.

33:51.555 --> 33:53.376
Come on, we have to hurry.

33:53.987 --> 33:55.440
Put on a coat, come on.

34:03.224 --> 34:07.374
That's where my father brought me ....

34:07.375 --> 34:10.610
And we fished there ...

34:13.839 --> 34:17.469
We caught all kinds of fish right there.

34:34.319 --> 34:35.802
Hey.

34:35.803 --> 34:37.735
Dont do that.

36:22.809 --> 36:25.220
I'll bring some dry clothes.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.970
Honey, what drawer put my shirt?

36:39.971 --> 36:42.244
In the second to the bottom.

36:44.453 --> 36:48.918
If you need to use the phone, use that.

36:48.919 --> 36:50.496
Thank you.

37:30.379 --> 37:33.244
Hello, is anyone there?

37:33.712 --> 37:35.880
Sorry to bother now.

37:35.881 --> 37:40.332
Do not worry Viola, could not attend because he was before with another patient ...

37:40.333 --> 37:41.886
Tell me everything.

37:43.182 --> 37:45.677
It's just that yesterday, something happened ....

37:46.225 --> 37:48.314
Something I can not ...

37:52.902 --> 37:54.458
In fact it is not important.

37:54.459 --> 38:00.596
You know we talked about this, express what you feel can only do you good ....

38:02.006 --> 38:04.367
I'm always here for you if you want to talk

38:04.379 --> 38:07.061
attends therapy and we took our time ...

38:07.062 --> 38:09.389
What do you want?....

38:58.628 --> 39:00.603
Here we go.

39:16.998 --> 39:19.516
For my love.

39:20.919 --> 39:23.711
As you like.

39:26.560 --> 39:30.179
Not many potatoes, either.

40:00.771 --> 40:05.683
I'll have to make the compliment, the chicken is very good.

40:06.881 --> 40:07.928
You like?

40:07.929 --> 40:10.062
It's very good.

40:12.127 --> 40:14.639
What restaurant did you buy?

40:15.213 --> 40:19.442
You know, how you might never trust me?

40:23.887 --> 40:25.858
I got in Levie ...

40:26.200 --> 40:27.803
Sorry, I just ....

40:27.804 --> 40:29.401
I just thought ...

40:29.402 --> 40:33.438
You know, that is already cooked, ready and ....

40:33.439 --> 40:35.078
Good.

40:37.521 --> 40:39.590
So What about your job?

40:40.287 --> 40:45.018
It is going well, I found new customers and the owner is happy.

40:54.342 --> 40:57.244
- Because I saw you the other day - Where?

40:57.627 --> 41:01.872
He was in a hurry, did not have time to say hello ...

41:02.916 --> 41:05.192
But I saw ...

41:06.429 --> 41:08.488
You were with your boss.

41:09.297 --> 41:11.048
Probably yes.

41:11.750 --> 41:14.929
They were going to his house ....

41:14.930 --> 41:17.496
What were you doing there?

41:21.042 --> 41:25.281
That was not home and was there for work.

41:25.881 --> 41:28.169
What are you trying to insinuate?

41:30.668 --> 41:33.926
Forgive me I'm sorry...

41:34.164 --> 41:38.888
Forgive me if I see my wife going to the house of another man ...

41:38.889 --> 41:43.004
and asked what he was doing there.

41:43.333 --> 41:48.217
Oh my God, here we go again with your jealousy ...

41:50.298 --> 41:55.228
It was not his home and was there for work.

41:57.958 --> 42:01.678
I am sorry forgive me....

42:01.679 --> 42:04.911
It's just that I love you too and something ....

42:04.912 --> 42:10.689
Listen, I'm starting to like here,

42:11.066 --> 42:15.199

42:17.220 --> 42:20.122
- Agree? - Agree

42:22.634 --> 42:25.677
Oh almost forgot ...

42:26.384 --> 42:27.627
I...

42:32.348 --> 42:34.546
Only a present.

42:36.407 --> 42:37.752
Is nothing.

42:37.753 --> 42:39.577
Oh my God...

42:40.046 --> 42:41.756
Its beautiful.

42:43.945 --> 42:46.646
You must have cost a fortune.

42:51.299 --> 42:53.319
It is very small.

42:53.320 --> 42:55.301
No, it's not okay.

42:55.302 --> 42:57.029
I can not get another, it is ...

42:57.030 --> 43:01.505
No, I will always use, I never take it off.

43:12.843 --> 43:15.262
Viola want to try again.

43:19.580 --> 43:23.460
Push, push, push again.

43:38.986 --> 43:40.983
Why not move?

43:42.560 --> 43:44.787
Not my baby.

43:48.716 --> 43:50.919
- You're good? - If

43:51.290 --> 43:55.198
- If that? - If I want to try again.

43:59.030 --> 44:05.131
- And you tell me just like that? - If you what I just said the only way

44:06.111 --> 44:08.776

44:12.878 --> 44:16.073
I'll bring the good wine, okay?

46:06.827 --> 46:08.775
Too much wine eh?

46:10.519 --> 46:14.223
Come, follow me, I have a surprise for you.

46:14.796 --> 46:18.069
Well, give me a second, I'll be back.

46:49.260 --> 46:52.271
If you need water, I'll bring out a little.

46:53.213 --> 46:56.907
It's not right honey, I'm fine.

47:18.456 --> 47:21.741
Right, right.

47:26.921 --> 47:30.976
Do not open your eyes, I'll ... do not open right?

47:36.214 --> 47:39.430
Well, you can open them.

47:41.391 --> 47:43.622
OMG.

47:44.432 --> 47:45.698
Kiss Me.

48:16.387 --> 48:19.161
- No, no - What?

48:19.439 --> 48:23.673
- No no no. - What?

48:27.558 --> 48:30.156
Stop stop Stop.

48:30.797 --> 48:32.576
I want to finish ....

48:36.012 --> 48:37.684
Like old times.

48:40.599 --> 48:41.599
And?

48:41.952 --> 48:44.024
Yes, why not?

48:47.090 --> 48:48.576
Kiss Me.

49:02.018 --> 49:03.274
Stay here.

49:49.547 --> 49:51.185
Am I what you mean now?

49:52.793 --> 49:53.897
What?

49:58.330 --> 50:00.124
You like me?

50:00.666 --> 50:02.602
What are you talking about?

50:10.200 --> 50:13.277
What happened yesterday when they come back?

50:14.720 --> 50:20.046
Please Nicola, I can not remember anything, I woke up in the shelter ...

50:22.180 --> 50:23.584
And then?

50:24.287 --> 50:28.543
And then I did not feel well, and he brought me back here.

50:33.882 --> 50:35.937
Look, I have this feeling ...

50:36.836 --> 50:39.201
That me you're hiding something.

50:40.779 --> 50:42.973
What the hell you say?

50:45.985 --> 50:49.133
Look, I know it has been difficult ...

50:50.302 --> 50:51.937
lately, okay ...?

50:52.103 --> 50:56.474
But you are my wife, you've sworn allegiance to me ...

50:56.475 --> 50:57.653
You're mine.

50:58.146 --> 50:59.972
Nicola, I do not like this game ...

51:00.117 --> 51:02.487
Well, come on, can you please get me this?

51:02.488 --> 51:04.589
First tell me what you did yesterday.

51:05.053 --> 51:06.898
Are you kidding?

51:12.691 --> 51:14.091
I know what you did ...

51:16.380 --> 51:17.860
Why...?

51:19.823 --> 51:22.778
I brought here with the best intentions ...

51:22.895 --> 51:25.442
To spend time together just you and me ...

51:25.827 --> 51:28.807
And start a new life, after what happened to us ...

51:28.808 --> 51:30.080
And you...

51:31.315 --> 51:34.546
At first I go out with the car, you ...

51:34.994 --> 51:41.002
You find someone in this place in the middle of nowhere to fornicate.

51:45.735 --> 51:47.515
- Nicola, you these .... - Shut up!

51:50.309 --> 51:52.389
You let that old bastard fuck you?

51:56.920 --> 51:59.527
You let that old took advantage of you?

51:59.539 --> 52:00.412

52:00.413 --> 52:01.876
You like me?

52:03.183 --> 52:07.672
- I asked you if you liked - Why do you do this?

52:14.143 --> 52:16.061
Cigarettes.

52:53.001 --> 52:54.336
Nicola...

52:54.978 --> 52:57.984
Please ... let me go ...

52:59.376 --> 53:02.104
I promise I'll forget everything ...

53:03.357 --> 53:05.225
You can not do this ...

53:05.428 --> 53:07.159
I'm your wife.

53:22.645 --> 53:25.323
I always trusted you .... too ....

53:25.324 --> 53:27.352
And what are you doing...?

53:27.559 --> 53:29.105
You are playing with me...?

53:29.106 --> 53:31.106
Do you think I'm stupid?

53:32.415 --> 53:34.336
You think I'm a fucking idiot?

53:37.879 --> 53:40.024
I think you're a fucking bitch.

53:54.978 --> 53:56.568
I am your husband....

53:57.522 --> 53:59.706
and I have another surprise for you.

54:36.938 --> 54:39.514
What will you do to me?

54:40.121 --> 54:42.356
What will you do to me?

54:46.699 --> 54:50.979
I'll do what men did in the Middle Ages ...

54:51.460 --> 54:54.067
When they came home from the Crusades ....

54:54.068 --> 54:58.697
And they realized that their wives had slept with someone else.

55:01.865 --> 55:03.360
Please let me go ....

55:03.361 --> 55:07.960
Let me go, let me go ....

55:10.745 --> 55:14.754

Understand it...

55:22.186 --> 55:24.497
I'm doing it for us ....

55:25.776 --> 55:28.556
If not, how can we try again?

55:54.850 --> 55:56.012
Oh my God...

55:56.783 --> 55:59.434
No, no, do not ...

55:59.435 --> 56:02.810
Awake, awake, my God ...

56:05.088 --> 56:08.104

56:08.600 --> 56:12.129

56:12.140 --> 56:14.355
You need your medicine, you need to take your medicine ...

56:14.576 --> 56:18.379
You're not well, I have them, I bring you, do not worry ....

56:22.715 --> 56:23.786
Shit...

58:15.659 --> 58:20.166
Well, well, well .... Here.

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:51.865
Why did you do that?

01:00:52.292 --> 01:00:53.562
Why?

01:00:57.198 --> 01:00:58.198
Come on.

01:01:10.013 --> 01:01:12.474
What will I do with you bitch?

01:01:12.793 --> 01:01:15.018
What will I do with you?

01:01:15.019 --> 01:01:17.890
Look at me bitch, I wanted to try again ....

01:01:17.891 --> 01:01:20.413
I wanted to try again, my love ....

01:01:20.414 --> 01:01:25.965
I wanted to have a baby, I wanted to have a baby, wanted ...

01:01:58.011 --> 01:02:02.654
You need to show more respect for your husband ...

01:02:10.666 --> 01:02:12.695
You understand?

01:02:59.129 --> 01:03:00.249
Please....

01:03:02.166 --> 01:03:05.676
- Somebody help me, please. - What happened?

01:03:06.222 --> 01:03:09.450
Relax, relax, it's all over, just sit ...

01:03:09.451 --> 01:03:11.196
Sit, sit ...

Let me get the first aid kit.

01:03:16.282 --> 01:03:17.853

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:22.437
You viola What are you doing?

01:03:22.847 --> 01:03:24.581
How did you get these wounds?

01:03:24.582 --> 01:03:25.859
'Damn bastard !!!

01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:28.286
She did it to herself.

01:03:29.011 --> 01:03:30.683
Just let us help.

01:03:30.904 --> 01:03:33.052
He said kill us both ....

01:03:33.053 --> 01:03:34.862
You have to shoot.

01:03:34.863 --> 01:03:39.463
I have not, help me, she needs to go to a hospital immediately.

01:03:40.237 --> 01:03:43.391
My God, look at that blood, look at that blood.

01:03:45.876 --> 01:03:49.169
You saw what happened yesterday, she is sick ...

01:03:49.372 --> 01:03:51.420
She will not stop hurting.

01:03:51.421 --> 01:03:54.312

01:03:55.155 --> 01:03:56.256

Viola, this is not you, these out of control ....

01:04:00.602 --> 01:04:02.052
These out of control ...

01:04:04.083 --> 01:04:07.128
You never were able to self control you ....

01:04:10.708 --> 01:04:12.716
You like her near you?

01:04:13.262 --> 01:04:14.324

01:04:14.325 --> 01:04:16.708
We will kill them both now.

01:04:18.832 --> 01:04:21.921
Do you like the smell your skin?

01:04:26.857 --> 01:04:28.164

01:09:44.794 --> 01:09:45.935

01:09:50.644 --> 01:09:51.779
Do you feel this?

01:10:00.214 --> 01:10:01.991
What a pity....

01:10:07.471 --> 01:10:09.192
Let me put it clear ....

01:10:09.193 --> 01:10:16.290
You show up out of nowhere, half-naked and want me to protect ....

01:10:16.936 --> 01:10:19.149
Do you want me to protect? ....

01:10:27.803 --> 01:10:29.199

01:10:32.427 --> 01:10:34.443
Be still, bitch.

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:37.863
Stay still...

01:10:41.077 --> 01:10:43.618

01:10:43.962 --> 01:10:47.648

Do not move, bitch ....

01:11:03.249 --> 01:11:04.385
Oh yeah....

01:11:04.386 --> 01:11:07.304
Be still .... Oh yeah

01:11:58.769 --> 01:11:59.906
Viola.

01:12:07.743 --> 01:12:09.393
Where are you going dear?

01:12:19.972 --> 01:12:21.184

I know you are here...

01:13:18.536 --> 01:13:24.997
I know I've gone too far, and I regret that, but ...

01:13:26.362 --> 01:13:27.468

01:13:28.663 --> 01:13:30.828
You can leave a bitch and I'll ....

01:14:10.938 --> 01:14:12.774
Come here, damn bitch ...

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:26.835
Die bitch.

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:43.894
Damn you.

Do not do it please.

01:15:11.044 --> 01:15:14.925
Wake up my love, please, I am.

01:16:36.143 --> 01:16:38.984
The situation is very delicate ...

01:16:38.985 --> 01:16:41.859
The powerful trauma that his wife suffered ....

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.852
With the loss of the baby ....

01:16:43.853 --> 01:16:46.247
He has left deep scars.

01:16:46.889 --> 01:16:50.547
In practical terms, what are the results?

01:16:50.941 --> 01:16:53.799
Look, the psychological ability of his wife,

01:16:53.811 --> 01:16:56.362
It has been seriously compromised ....

01:16:56.587 --> 01:16:58.926
- I saw you the other time - Where?

01:16:58.927 --> 01:17:00.716
You were with your boss ....

01:17:01.356 --> 01:17:03.848
You were going home.

01:17:10.730 --> 01:17:14.892
Here we go again, following me all day?

01:17:15.436 --> 01:17:17.369
That's not normal,

01:17:22.173 --> 01:17:23.751
What do you mean?

01:17:23.827 --> 01:17:28.236
Excuse me, if I see my husband coming into the apartment of another woman ...

01:17:28.237 --> 01:17:31.543
and I wonder what is he doing there?

01:17:31.782 --> 01:17:33.483
Over the next few weeks ....

01:17:33.484 --> 01:17:37.089
You will see a completely unexpected change of behavior ...

01:17:37.090 --> 01:17:42.618
As attacks of jealousy mixed with the need to feel protected ....

01:17:55.573 --> 01:17:58.481
To find someone that makes you feel safe ....

01:17:59.305 --> 01:18:04.075
- What happened to you? - He's coming now, he wants to kill me.

01:18:12.043 --> 01:18:15.656
Even his sexual perception will be confused ....

01:18:15.965 --> 01:18:19.658
Sometimes it gets so distant that reject any contact ....

01:18:19.659 --> 01:18:23.681
And sometimes, on the other hand, will aggressively forward to it ....

01:18:24.209 --> 01:18:29.229
A compulsively shamelessly ....

01:18:29.230 --> 01:18:32.804
Possibly even violently ....

01:18:33.344 --> 01:18:37.274
His condition is not treatable with any medicine or intervention because ...

01:18:37.275 --> 01:18:40.893
His wound, if we call it ....

01:18:40.894 --> 01:18:43.124
It is completely psychological.

01:18:43.125 --> 01:18:45.671
Just tell me ...

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:48.567
What this means to her.

01:18:50.223 --> 01:18:52.515
mental instability ....

01:18:52.516 --> 01:18:55.129
Schizophrenia, personality changes ....

01:18:55.575 --> 01:18:58.390
It could become dangerous for herself ...

01:18:58.611 --> 01:19:01.814
But above all, a danger to others.

01:19:08.402 --> 01:19:12.019
His wife needs to be treated by qualified professionals.

01:19:12.739 --> 01:19:15.108
Â¿Qualified professionals? ....

01:19:15.483 --> 01:19:17.243
Â¿Un speak?

01:19:18.849 --> 01:19:19.929
I can not do this.

01:19:19.930 --> 01:19:21.786
There are many places.

01:19:25.573 --> 01:19:30.110
Just tell me, what else I can do.

01:19:32.054 --> 01:19:34.351
There is no other solution.

01:20:08.568 --> 01:20:11.330
The only thing I can suggest is that the lead

01:20:11.342 --> 01:20:13.790
to a place that does not remember what happened ...

01:20:13.791 --> 01:20:15.478
But it is not a cure ....

01:20:15.479 --> 01:20:18.595
Sooner or later, the problem will arise again.

01:21:25.966 --> 01:21:27.620
Do not worry my love....

01:21:27.621 --> 01:21:29.366
I'll take care.

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:34.775
Let's go to the house of my uncles, a few days ...

01:21:36.044 --> 01:21:39.177
You'll see, everything will be fine.

01:21:39.201 --> 01:21:43.401
