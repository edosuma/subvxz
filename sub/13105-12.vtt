RICK SPRINGFIELD.
ISN'T RICK SPRINGFIELD
A BAND FROM L.A.?

00:09.510 --> 00:11.569
UH, NO, YOU'RE THINKING
BUFFALO SPRINGFIELD.

00:11.610 --> 00:14.238
I LOVE THAT SONG THAT
THEY DID WITH, THE, UM,

00:14.280 --> 00:15.178
WITH THE PET SHOP BOYS.

00:15.210 --> 00:17.098

DUSTY SPRINGFIELD.

00:17.150 --> 00:18.447
I AM?
YEAH.

00:18.480 --> 00:21.449
OH.
CHRIS IS RIGHT.
IT'S, UH, RICK SPRINGFIELD.

00:21.480 --> 00:24.813
MY MOM IS ACTUALLY A HUGE FAN
OF RICK SPRINGFIELD.

00:24.850 --> 00:28.286
SHE ACTUALLY DRESSED ME UP ONCE
AS HIM FOR HALLOWEEN.

00:28.320 --> 00:31.187
I... STILL ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE SPIDER-MAN MYSELF,

00:31.230 --> 00:34.620
BUT MY MA DIDN'T THINK...
I RETIRE,
CHAMPION OF THE WORLD.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.594
YOU HAVE, LIKE,
MINUS 800 POINTS.
WHATEVER.

00:36.630 --> 00:38.621
HELLO.

00:38.670 --> 00:39.694
CAN YOU MAKE IT TWO?

00:39.740 --> 00:41.696

YOU'D BE HERE.

LET US LEAVE

00:44.210 --> 00:46.201
UNTIL HE'S CROWNED
KING OF THE DORKS.

00:46.240 --> 00:47.332
OH.
HEY, WHY DON'T I GET THIS?

00:47.380 --> 00:49.245
AND THEN YOU CAN GET
THE NEXT R_OUND.

00:49.280 --> 00:50.577

I'M MEETING SOMEONE.

00:50.610 --> 00:51.702
OH. SORRY.
DON'T BE SORRY.

00:51.750 --> 00:55.242
SO IS IT LIKE "SOMEONE" SOMEONE
OR JUST, LIKE, SOMEONE?

00:55.280 --> 00:57.384
I'M NOT SURE YET.

00:57.420 --> 00:59.650
OH. THANKS FOR THE DRINK.

00:59.690 --> 01:01.817
NO WORRIES.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.487
HEY.

01:03.530 --> 01:07.250
OKAY, DIAZ, ADD 'EM UP.
OH, BEFORE YOU DO,

01:07.300 --> 01:09.291
WE ALL AGREE THE WINNER
DRINKS FREE, RIGHT?
YES.

01:09.330 --> 01:12.538
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL BE
BUYING YOUR OWN DRINKS TONIGHT.

01:12.570 --> 01:14.834
WHY? I DIDN'T WIN?
I ALWAYS WIN.

01:14.870 --> 01:16.565
OH, NO.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.601
YOU BEAT ME?

01:18.640 --> 01:19.709
ARE YOU MAD?

01:19.740 --> 01:20.809
NO, I LOVE IT.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.546
OH, GET THIS.

HAS FOUND HIS QUEEN.

01:31.420 --> 01:32.409
I'M GONNA NEED
ANOTHER DRINK.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.781

OKAY, YOU'RE NOT WRONG.
(siren wailing in distance)

01:44.800 --> 01:47.132
IT IS A BIT BETTER THAN
RUNNING 5K EVERY MORNING.

01:47.170 --> 01:49.331
THE BEST PART IS,
THERE'S NO SHIN SPLINTS.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.803
WELL, IF YOU DO IT RIGHT.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.501
AND YOU--
YOU'RE GETTING PRETTY CLOSE.

01:52.540 --> 01:55.373
OH. I SUPPOSE YOU THINK
I NEED MORE PRACTICE.

01:55.410 --> 01:57.776
WELL, I'M A VERY GOOD TRAINING
PARTNER.
YEAH, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

01:57.810 --> 01:59.277
I'M ALL RIGHT?

02:02.650 --> 02:03.719
MM-HMM.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.581
I'VE GOTI'A GO.
MNH-MNH.

02:05.620 --> 02:07.656
I GO'I'I'A GO TO WORK.
SORRY. I'M GONNA BE LATE.

02:07.690 --> 02:08.657
ANDY, YOU'VE BEEN AN HOUR EARLY
EVERY SHIFI'

02:08.690 --> 02:10.328
FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

02:10.360 --> 02:11.884
THAT'S A PRETI'Y GOOD IDEA,
CONSIDERING.

02:11.930 --> 02:14.398
YOU WERE PROTECTING
A FELLOW OFFICER

02:14.430 --> 02:15.249
WHO WAS INNOCENT.

02:15.300 --> 02:16.927
YEAH, AND THEN I FAKED
THE LOG ENTRY.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.460
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW BAD THAT IS?

02:18.500 --> 02:20.559
LOOK, I DON'T WANNA BE
THE KIND OF POLICE THAT JUST

02:20.600 --> 02:22.739
MAKES THINGS UP AS THEY GO,
YOU KNOW?

02:22.770 --> 02:24.909
CHOOSING WHICH RULES APPLY
AND WHICH ONES DON'T.

02:24.940 --> 02:26.237
SO YOU'RE GONNA PLAY
BY THE BOOK?

02:26.280 --> 02:28.407
YEAH. I AM.
THE NEW YOU?

02:28.440 --> 02:30.647
ACTUALLY,
IT'S THE OLD ME.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.614
JUST GOT DISTRACT ED.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.777
I'M NOT GONNA GET
DISTRACT ED ANYMORE.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.515
NO?
NO.

02:36.550 --> 02:38.245
YOU SURE?

02:38.290 --> 02:41.509
'CAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY
OF DISTRACT IONS OUT THERE.
I'M SURE.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.381
THAT'S AMAZING, 'CAUSE...

02:44.430 --> 02:46.591
IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY
NORMAL TO BE DISTRACT ED.

02:46.630 --> 02:47.790
MM-HMM.

02:47.830 --> 02:48.797
(kisses)

02:48.830 --> 02:51.469
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.664
(bed thuds)

02:54.700 --> 02:59.376
I AM COMPLETELY 100%...
FOCUSED.

02:59.410 --> 03:01.378
OH, YEAH? LOOK AT THAT.

03:01.410 --> 03:02.399
(headboard thuds)

03:02.450 --> 03:03.769
OH, YEAH.

03:08.550 --> 03:09.778
I-I THINK YOU CHECKED
THAT ONE...

03:09.820 --> 03:11.515
(beeps)
ALREADY.

03:11.550 --> 03:14.212
DOUBLE-CHECKING EVERYTHING'S OFF
DOESN'T MEAN I'M MANIC, SAM.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.750
DO YOU WANT ME TO COME BY
AND WATER YOUR PLANTS

03:15.790 --> 03:18.918
WHILE YOU'RE GONE?
I'VE GOT A VERY GREEN THUMB.

03:18.960 --> 03:22.691
I'VE ALREADY MADE ARRANGEMENTS
WITH THE NEIGHBOR.

03:22.730 --> 03:24.823
I'M JUST GOING ACROSS TOWN
TO MY SISTER'S PLACE,

03:24.870 --> 03:27.668
SO IF THERE'S
A PLANT EMERGENCY,

03:27.700 --> 03:29.361
I'LL COME BY
AND TAKE CARE OF IT MYSELF.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.366
OKAY. WHAT ABOUT THE MAIL?

03:31.410 --> 03:33.708
REALLY? YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M FINE.

03:33.740 --> 03:35.674
YOU KNOW, YOU DIDN'T NEED
TO COME BY TODAY.

03:35.710 --> 03:38.372
YEAH, YOU, UH,
SAID THAT LAST WEEK

03:38.410 --> 03:39.809
AND THE WEEK BEFORE.

03:39.850 --> 03:41.272
SAM, I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.947
I TOLD YOU, I JUST--

03:42.990 --> 03:44.685
I-I KNOW. YOU NEED--
YOU NEED SPACE.

03:44.720 --> 03:46.984
ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT?
I JUST--BUT AS A--

03:47.020 --> 03:49.784
AS A PLANT LOVER, I-I WANNA
COME OVER AND MAKE SURE

03:49.830 --> 03:52.719
THESE GUYS HAVE
EVERYTHING THEY NEED--

03:52.760 --> 03:56.264
SUNLIGHT, WATER...
SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.029
SO DOES...
EVERYONE AT THE STATION

03:58.070 --> 03:59.389
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED YET?

03:59.440 --> 04:01.635
UH, AS FAR AS
THEY'RE CONCERNED,

04:01.670 --> 04:03.865
YOU'RE ON LEAVE,
TAKING CARE OF FAMILY BUSINESS.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.798
THEY DIDN'T PRESS YOU
FOR DETAILS?

04:05.840 --> 04:08.570
(inhales deeply) PEOPLE DON'T
PRESS ME FOR DETAILS.

04:08.610 --> 04:11.738
I'M LUCKY THAT WAY.

04:11.780 --> 04:15.011
(sighs) ANYWAY...

04:15.050 --> 04:16.347
I GUESS I SHOULD GET GOING.

04:16.390 --> 04:17.743
AT LEAST I'M GONNA DRIVE YOU,
OKAY?

04:17.790 --> 04:18.848
I INSIST.

04:18.890 --> 04:23.054
YEAH. I KNEW YOU WOULD,
WHICH IS WHY I CALLED A CAB.

04:23.090 --> 04:24.387
YEAH.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.921
(kisses)

04:26.960 --> 04:30.794
I'M GONNA SIT YOU DOWN
AT MY DESK FOR NOW.

04:30.830 --> 04:34.038
HERE. AND YOU CAN PLAY
"SOLITAIRE."

04:34.070 --> 04:36.538
(clicks keys)
AND THERE IS A GAME
WITH THESE BOMBS ON IT

04:36.570 --> 04:39.505
THAT'S REALLY COOL, BUT DON'T--
DON'T DELETE ANYTHING,

04:39.540 --> 04:40.802
AND DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.308
JUST STICK TO THE GAMES,

04:43.350 --> 04:45.477
AND I WILL BE RIGHT BACK,
OKAY?

04:45.510 --> 04:46.613
(tone chimes, woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

04:46.650 --> 04:48.379
HEY.
HEY!

04:48.420 --> 04:50.547
OH, MAN, YOU KNOW, THE I.T. GUYS
KEEP GETTING YOUNGER.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.911
(laughs)
YEAH. UM, LEO'S SI‘I‘I'ER

04:52.960 --> 04:54.712
HAD SOME KIND OF HAIR EMERGENCY
OR SOMETHING,

04:54.760 --> 04:58.480
SO SHE'S GONNA BE BY TO PICK
HIM UP IN ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO.

04:58.530 --> 04:59.497
I'VE GOT A LIGHT MORNING.

04:59.530 --> 05:00.690
IF YOU WANT,
I COULD TAKE HIM UP

05:00.730 --> 05:01.754
TO THE GUNS AND GANGS OFFICE,
YOU KNOW?

05:01.800 --> 05:03.688
HELP HIM PICK OUT A COOL TA'I'I'OO
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

05:03.730 --> 05:05.698
(gasps) I DON'T THINK
THAT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA.

05:05.730 --> 05:07.368
I JUST FIGURED, YOU KNOW,
WE'VE BEEN OUT, LIKE, WHAT,

05:07.400 --> 05:08.697
THREE, FOUR TIMES?

05:08.740 --> 05:11.004
IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT TIME
I MEET THE BIG GUY.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.406
YOU KNOW? MAYBE I CAN MAKE
A GOOD IMPRESSION ON HIS MOM.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.600
YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?
HE'S--HE'S NOT FEELING WELL.

05:14.640 --> 05:15.902
HE'S--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GOT.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.374
HE'S JUST...
IT'S NOT GOOD.

05:18.410 --> 05:19.672
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO CATCH IT.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.041
YEAH. OKAY.
CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

05:22.080 --> 05:25.413
SO MAYBE ANOTHER TIME?
YEAH. YEAH, SURE.
OKAY, YEAH.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.883
ANOTHER TIME, THEN.

05:26.920 --> 05:29.627
STEVE?

05:29.660 --> 05:30.820
YEAH?

05:30.860 --> 05:33.499
WERE YOU...
COMING TO SEE ME?

05:36.060 --> 05:36.992
YOU GUYS GOT BE'I'I'ER COFFEE
DOWN HERE,

05:37.030 --> 05:39.999
AND THE FACT THAT I HAVE
TO WALK BY YOUR DESK

05:40.040 --> 05:43.032
IS A COMPLETE COINCIDENCE.

05:43.070 --> 05:44.367
(Oliver) IT'S TRUE, FRANKIE.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.661
I WANT--I WANT THE MARINE UNIT,
MAN.

05:45.710 --> 05:47.871
GET ME OFF THE STREETS
AND IN A BOAT.

05:47.910 --> 05:49.844
(Frank)
OKAY, ON OTHER BUSINESS,

05:49.880 --> 05:51.848
RECERTIFICATION'S COMING UP
END OF THE MONTH,

05:51.880 --> 05:53.848
SO IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
TO THE RANGE IN A WHILE,

05:53.880 --> 05:56.713
I SUGGEST THAT--
(cell phone ringing)

05:56.750 --> 05:58.388
(man) OOH.
(officers murmuring)

05:58.420 --> 05:59.557
SORRY, MAN. MY BAD.

05:59.590 --> 06:02.957
I SUGGEST THAT YOU ALL GET
OUT THERE AND BOOK IT EARLY.

06:02.990 --> 06:04.685
THOSE SLOTS--
THEY FILL UP REAL FAST.

06:04.730 --> 06:07.597
(cell phone vibrating)

06:07.630 --> 06:08.995
ALL RIGHT.

06:09.030 --> 06:11.089
THAT'S IT. LET'S GET OUT THERE,
DO WHAT WE DO.

06:11.130 --> 06:13.735
SEE YOU LATER.
(indistinct conversations)

06:13.770 --> 06:16.739
HI. YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A WHAT?

06:16.770 --> 06:18.408
UH, I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW.

06:18.440 --> 06:19.930
ACTUALLY, IF I DO HAVE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

06:19.980 --> 06:22.574
CHECK THE BOXES
UNDER THE STAIRS.

06:22.610 --> 06:27.445
YEAH, LOOK, I'M GONNA GO.
OKAY. YEAH, ME, TOO. BYE.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.482
KIDS?
UH, NO. IT'S CELERY.

06:29.520 --> 06:31.181
SHE'S, UH,
GETTING HER HOUSE FUMIGATED.

06:31.220 --> 06:32.983
SHE'S STAYING AT MY PLACE
FOR A FEW DAYS.

06:33.020 --> 06:34.851
CELERY. IT'S THAT WITCH
YOU BROUGHT TO MY WEDDING.

06:34.890 --> 06:36.118
THAT IS THE SAME CELERY.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.627
YOU SAID "WITCH" WITH A "W,"
THOUGH, RIGHT?

06:37.660 --> 06:38.786
YEAH. DIDN'T ZOE MOVE
INTO YOUR PLACE

06:38.830 --> 06:40.695
AFTER A COUPLE OF DATES?

06:40.730 --> 06:43.790
YOU GOTTA BRING THAT UP, HUH?
YEAH.

06:43.830 --> 06:44.819
YOU REMEMBER THAT?
I DO.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.963
ALL RIGHT. WELL, YOU KNOW ME.
I CAN'T SAY NO.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.434
IT'S LIKE A CONDITION
OR SOMETHING, MAN.

06:49.470 --> 06:50.801
ANYWAY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THOUGH?

06:50.840 --> 06:54.571
FRANKIE, I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO ASK YA ABOUT OUR GIRL.

06:54.610 --> 06:55.770
LAST TIME I TALKED
TO NOELLE,

06:55.810 --> 06:56.845
SHE WAS JUST--
SHE WAS STILL WAITING.

06:56.880 --> 07:00.179
(radio chatter)

07:00.220 --> 07:01.812
THE TESTS WERE CLEAR.
IT'S NOT CANCER.

07:01.850 --> 07:05.217
BUT THE DOCTOR SAYS
WE GOTTA KEEP AN EYE ON IT.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.683
YEAH.
ONE DAY AT A TIME, RIGHT?

07:06.720 --> 07:08.859
ONLY WAY TO LIVE, BRO.

07:08.890 --> 07:11.154
YEAH. ONLY WAY TO LIVE.

07:11.190 --> 07:13.090
(radio chatter)

07:13.130 --> 07:15.598
SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU AND NICK
BEEN DOING IT?
EXCUSE ME?

07:15.630 --> 07:17.621
'CAUSE I'M GUESSING, LIKE,
THREE OR FOUR WEEKS.

07:17.670 --> 07:18.625
I MEAN, THAT'S WHEN
I NOTICED THE DIFFERENCE,

07:18.670 --> 07:20.934
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THIS, LIKE,
THIS, LIKE, GLOW.

07:20.970 --> 07:23.530
AND NICK--HE JUST--
HE LOOKS, I DON'T KNOW.

07:23.570 --> 07:26.061
LIKE MORE...
LIKE, ACCOMPLISHED.

07:26.110 --> 07:27.134
I DON'T HAVE A GLOW.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.101
YEAH, YOU DO.
NO.

07:28.140 --> 07:30.244
AND--AND YOU SHOULD.
YOU KNOW, NICK'S GREAT.

07:30.280 --> 07:32.874
I MEAN, IF I WASN'T CLIMBING
DOV MOUNTAIN,

07:32.920 --> 07:35.070
I WOULD BE ALL OVER THAT.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.680
NICK AND I... ARE FRIENDSHIP.
WE ARE FRIENDS.

07:37.720 --> 07:39.483
WE HAVE A FRIENDSHIP.
I KNOW.

07:39.520 --> 07:41.010
OR FRIENDS WHO DO IT.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.949
(chuckles) THE BEST KIND
OF FRIENDS, RIGHT?

07:43.990 --> 07:46.857
(static crackles)
(female dispatcher) 1519,
we've got a 9-1-1 report

07:46.900 --> 07:48.993
of a man sleeping in the middle
of Wenton Park.

07:49.030 --> 07:50.588

07:54.840 --> 07:56.728
HEY, MAYBE ME AND YOU
AND DOV AND NICK

07:56.770 --> 07:58.260
SHOULD GO ON, LIKE,
A DOUBLE DATE.

07:58.310 --> 08:00.676
AH...
I MEAN, DO PEOPLE DO
THAT KIND OF STUFF?

08:00.710 --> 08:01.904
OR IS THAT JUST, LIKE,
A PRELUDE TO AN ORGY?

08:01.940 --> 08:03.601
'CAUSE I'M NOT REALLY
INTO THAT.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.799
NO OFFENSE,
I JUST DON'T SHARE.

08:04.850 --> 08:07.148
I HAVE NO IDEA. SIR?

08:07.180 --> 08:08.943
SIR, YOU CAN'T SLEEP HERE.

08:08.980 --> 08:11.983
ARE YOU OKAY?

08:12.020 --> 08:14.011
UH, I DON'T THINK
HE'S BREATHING.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.980
(taps le
SIR? g)

08:21.660 --> 08:22.763
OKAY.

08:22.800 --> 08:27.760
I TOTALLY THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS
A DEAD GUY UNDER THERE.

08:27.800 --> 08:28.994
(static crackles)
DISPATCH, THIS IS 1519.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.860
DISREGARD THE SLEEPER
IN WENTON PARK.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.571
IT'S JUST A PILE OF CLOTHES.

08:32.610 --> 08:34.077
(static crackles)
(female dispatcher) Copy, 1519.

08:34.110 --> 08:36.271
MIGHT WAN NA GET PUBLIC WORKS
DOWN HERE TO DISPOSE OF THEM.

08:36.310 --> 08:37.299
Copy that, 1519.
We'll contact them.
YOU GOTTA ADMIT,

08:37.350 --> 08:38.408
I MEAN,
IT'S PRETTY LIFELIKE.

08:38.450 --> 08:41.271
I MEAN, WHOEVER DID THAT
DESERVES SOME SORT OF PRIZE.

08:41.320 --> 08:44.517
(gunshot, echoing)

08:46.790 --> 08:49.554
(dog barking,
horn honks in distance)

08:55.900 --> 08:57.128
CHLOE...

08:57.170 --> 08:59.024
(gunshots)

08:59.070 --> 09:00.697
(gasps)

09:00.740 --> 09:02.264
(gunshots continue,
people screaming)

09:02.300 --> 09:05.736
(static crackles)
1519! OFFICER DOWN!
OFFICER DOWN!

09:05.770 --> 09:06.600
(female dispatcher)
All available units,

09:06.640 --> 09:08.278
we have a Officer down
at Wenton Park.

09:08.310 --> 09:10.244
All available units

09:10.280 --> 09:12.646
(gunshots reverberating)
I repeat, Officer down.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.148
(crying)

09:15.180 --> 09:16.647
(screaming
and gunshots continue)

09:16.690 --> 09:18.578
(gasping)

09:20.020 --> 09:21.749
ARE YOU OKAY?

09:21.790 --> 09:24.122
(crying) I'M OKAY, I'M OKAY.
(speaks indistinctly)
NO, NO, NO.

09:24.160 --> 09:27.721
CHLOE, CHLOE, I WANT YOU TO KEEP
YOUR HAND ON YOUR NECK, OKAY?

09:27.760 --> 09:29.227
YOU KEEP APPLYING PRESSURE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

09:29.260 --> 09:30.295
1519, what's your exact position
in the park?

09:30.330 --> 09:31.729
(gunshots_continue)
(crying)

09:31.770 --> 09:33.260
WE'RE PINNED BEHIND
SOME SORT OF MONUMENT

09:33.300 --> 09:34.892
AT THE EAST END OF THE PARK.

09:34.940 --> 09:37.158
(gunshots continue)
WE'RE BEING SHOT AT
RIGHT NOW.

09:37.210 --> 09:38.609
CHLOE'S BEEN SHOT.
WE NEED MEDICS.

09:38.640 --> 09:40.938
I REPEAT,
PRICE HAS BEEN SHOT.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.072
WE NEED MEDICS NOW.

09:42.110 --> 09:42.940
(Oliver) Hold on, McNally.

09:42.980 --> 09:44.607
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.
(Siren walling)

09:44.650 --> 09:46.868
(female dispatcher) 10-33.
Officer down.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.717
Active shooter.
Officers under fire.

09:48.750 --> 09:51.389
(Nick) 1527. We're on our way.
Approaching King and Duncan.

09:51.420 --> 09:52.239
WE GOT MCNALLY AND PRICE.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.178
DIAZ, COLLINS,
YOU FIND THAT SHOOTER.

09:54.220 --> 09:56.051
(static crackles)
(Nick) Copy. Three minutes out.

09:56.090 --> 09:58.388
LOOKS LIKE THE BULLET
DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE VEST.

09:58.430 --> 10:00.990
LISTEN, I JUST NEED YOU
TO APPLY PRESSURE TO YOUR NECK.

10:01.030 --> 10:02.861
THAT'S ALL YOU GOTTA DO,
OKAY?

10:02.900 --> 10:04.720
MY HEAD FEELS REALLY,
REALLY WEIRD.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.759
DON'T TRY TO TALK.
I JUST WANT YOU TO BREATHE,

10:05.800 --> 10:07.734
AND EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE OKAY.

10:07.770 --> 10:08.896
OKAY.
JUST KEEP...

10:08.940 --> 10:10.805
(coughs)

10:10.840 --> 10:13.070
(Nick) Andy, you got eyes
on the shooter?

10:13.110 --> 10:15.999
(gunshot, shot reverberates)

10:16.040 --> 10:17.302
(static crackles)
CONDOS AT THE EAST END.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.772
YOU GUYS, HE'S STILL
SHOOTING AT US.

10:18.810 --> 10:19.913
I THINK
HE'S FROM THE ROOF.

10:19.950 --> 10:21.747
Copy. We're on it.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.179
IS THAT NICK?
YES.

10:23.220 --> 10:25.688
TELL HIM NOT TO TELL DOV,
OKAY? BECAUSE IT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.756
ANDY, HE'S SO WORRIED.
CHLOE, STOP TALKING.
JUST BREATHE. IT'S OKAY.

10:27.790 --> 10:31.180
(static crackles)
(female dispatcher) 1519,
ETF and medics are en route.

10:31.230 --> 10:34.859
(Andy) Guys? Where are you?
We've gotta get her outta here.

10:34.900 --> 10:36.322
WE'RE INSIDE,
HEADING TO THE ROOF.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.022
(static crackles)

10:41.170 --> 10:42.296
(static crackles)
(Andy)
I can't stop the bleeding!

10:42.340 --> 10:44.035
Please. (gasps)

10:44.070 --> 10:45.901
Where are the medics?

10:45.940 --> 10:47.009
(static crackles)
(Oliver) Andy, Andy,
it's Oliver.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.268
Listen to me.
We're seconds away.

10:48.310 --> 10:50.904
We're gonna get her away. Stay
here. Stay on your radio, okay?

10:50.950 --> 10:52.941
(Andy) Okay.
(door rattles)

10:59.190 --> 11:00.953
(static crackles)
ROOF CLEAR.

11:00.990 --> 11:01.957
THE SHOOTER'S GONE.

11:01.990 --> 11:04.254
(Oliver) Moving in, moving in.
(siren wailing)

11:04.290 --> 11:05.757
(siren blares)
Where are you, Andy?

11:05.790 --> 11:06.586
I don't see you.
CHLOE.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.088
OLIVER!

11:11.130 --> 11:12.427
I'M BEHIND HERE!

11:12.470 --> 11:14.097
CHLOE?

11:14.140 --> 11:16.438
SHE JUST PASSED OUT. SHE WAS
JUST TALKING A FEW MINUTES AGO.

11:16.470 --> 11:19.701
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
OKAY, CHLOE,
OPEN YOUR EYES FOR ME, OKAY?

11:19.740 --> 11:21.435
OPEN YOUR EYES FOR ME,
DARLING.
WHERE ARE THE MEDICS?

11:21.480 --> 11:22.538
THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND US.
THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND US.

11:22.580 --> 11:23.979
CHLOE, YOU HOLD ON.
THE MEDICS ARE RIGHT BEHIND US.

11:24.010 --> 11:25.841
(sirens wailing,
vehicles approach)
I WANT YOU TO TALK TO ME.
PRICE!

11:25.880 --> 11:28.872
PRICE, OPEN YOUR EYES.

11:30.950 --> 11:33.089
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

11:33.120 --> 11:34.917
WHAT IS THE TALLEST MOUNTAIN
IN NORTH AMERICA?

11:34.960 --> 11:37.884
BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.158
(men laughing)

11:39.190 --> 11:41.124
(man) BROKEBACK.
(laughing)
COME ON, PEOPLE,

11:41.160 --> 11:42.457
I-I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE
YOUR TIME WITH US

11:42.500 --> 11:44.365
GO BY A LITTLE FASTER,
AND, HEY, WHO KNOWS?

11:44.400 --> 11:46.732
MAYBE YOU'LL LEARN A THING
OR TWO IN THE PROCESS.

11:46.770 --> 11:48.089
(radio chatter)
(Dov) OKAY.

11:48.140 --> 11:50.506
HERE'S ONE FOR
THE HORSERACING FANS.
EPSTEIN.

11:50.540 --> 11:52.098
(man coughing)

11:55.140 --> 11:57.040
SORRY, SIR. YOU KNOW.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.105
I HAD THE CARDS IN MY BAG.
I DIDN'T TDIOIVK IT WAS--

11:59.150 --> 12:00.242
CHLOE'S BEEN SHOT.

12:01.820 --> 12:03.048
WHAT?

12:03.090 --> 12:04.409
SOUNDS LIKE HER AND MCNALLY
GOT AMBUSHED.

12:04.450 --> 12:06.042
SHE'S ON HER WAY
TO MEMORIAL RIGHT NOW.

12:06.090 --> 12:08.513
WH-WHAT HAPPENED?
IS SHE OKAY?
I DON'T KNOW.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.528
(sighs) I GOTTA CALL
HER FAMILY.

12:10.560 --> 12:13.199
SIR, I'D LIKE TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL.

12:13.230 --> 12:16.097
DIAZ IS ON HIS WAY HERE
TO--TO TAKE YOU.

12:16.130 --> 12:19.429
LISTEN. I WANT UPDATES ON
HER CONDITION EVERY HALF HOUR.

12:19.470 --> 12:21.199
YES, SIR. ABSOLUTELY.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.436
(breathing unevenly)

12:26.470 --> 12:28.973
(indistinct conversations)
MEDICS GOT HERE QUICK,
BUT SHE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

12:29.010 --> 12:32.173
(radio chatter)
SHE WENT DOWN... THERE,

12:32.210 --> 12:35.543
AND MCNALLY DRAGGED HER TO COVER
BEHIND THAT ROCK RIGHT THERE.

12:35.580 --> 12:39.118
THEY CAME HERE ON A CALL?
YEAH, A 9-1-1.

12:39.150 --> 12:42.779
THEY GOT A CALL ABOUT THIS GUY.

12:42.830 --> 12:43.922
(siren whoops)

12:43.960 --> 12:46.087
WELL...

12:46.130 --> 12:48.189
THAT WAS A SETUP, RIGHT?

12:48.230 --> 12:49.788
YEAH, THEY NEVER STOOD
A CHANCE.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.161
ALL RIGHT, THE MINUTE
YOU'RE DONE HERE,

12:51.200 --> 12:53.065
I WANT ALL THIS BAGGED
AND SENT RIGHT TO THE LAB, OKAY?

12:53.100 --> 12:54.397
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
YOU GOT IT.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.260
(sirens wailing)

12:56.300 --> 12:58.029
(radio chatter,
indistinct conversations)

12:58.070 --> 12:59.435
I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS A GUNSHOT.

12:59.470 --> 13:00.778
I MEAN, IT TOOK ME A SECOND

13:00.810 --> 13:02.505
TO EVEN FIGURE OUT
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
ANDY, YOU GOT HER TO SAFETY.

13:02.540 --> 13:03.939
YOU GOT HER OUT OF
THE LINE OF FIRE.

13:03.980 --> 13:05.948
NICK, I COULDN'T EVEN GET HER
TO STOP TALKING.

13:05.980 --> 13:07.049
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:07.080 --> 13:09.241
I THINK I NEED TO GO
TO THE HOSPITAL WITH HER, OKAY?

13:09.280 --> 13:11.510
I JUST GOT TO--
NO. THEY'LL LET US KNOW
IF WE NEED TO BE THERE, OKAY?

13:11.550 --> 13:13.108
WE STILL GOT TO TAKE
YOUR STATEMENT.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.855
THAT'S GONNA TAKE
SOME TIME.

13:14.890 --> 13:17.427
(radio chatter)

13:20.430 --> 13:21.522
WHAT?

13:21.560 --> 13:23.369
YOU'VE BEEN SHOT.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.368
(rustling)

13:25.400 --> 13:28.233
IT MUST HAVE HAPPENED
WHEN I WAS DRAGGING CHLOE.

13:28.270 --> 13:29.999
ANDY, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE?

13:30.040 --> 13:31.268
I DIDN'T EVEN NOTICE.
I JUST--

13:31.310 --> 13:33.073
ANOTHER COUPLE OF INCHES,
THAT--
OKAY.

13:33.110 --> 13:35.601
OKAY. I'M FINE.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.073
YOU SHOULD REPORT THIS.

13:37.110 --> 13:38.873
NICK, IT'S A TEAR
IN SOME FABRIC.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.514
IF I DO THAT, I'M GONNA BE HUNG
UP IN PAPERWORK THIS WHOLE TIME.

13:40.550 --> 13:42.108
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO HELP ANYBODY.

13:42.150 --> 13:43.515
I KNOW, BUT, ANDY,
THIS IS EVIDENCE.

13:43.550 --> 13:45.108
WE NEED EVERYTHING WE CAN GET
ON THIS GUY.

13:45.150 --> 13:46.378
HE'S STILL OUT THERE.

13:46.420 --> 13:49.981
(radio chatter)

13:50.030 --> 13:52.225
HOW--HOW BAD? I MEAN,
WHERE--WHERE DID SHE GET SHOT?

13:52.260 --> 13:53.852
(exhales deeply)

13:53.900 --> 13:55.128
THE NECK.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.061
OKAY. UM...
WAS SHE CONSCIOUS?

13:58.100 --> 13:59.590
I MEAN, WH-WHEN SHE WENT
INTO THE AMBULANCE,

13:59.630 --> 14:01.530
WAS--WAS SHE AWAKE?
I DON'T KNOW.

14:01.570 --> 14:03.162
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DON'T KNOW? YOU WERE THERE.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.405
I WENT AFTER THE SHOOTER.
BY THE TIME I GOT BACK,

14:05.440 --> 14:07.203
THE PARAMEDICS HAD ALREADY
BAGGED AND LOADED.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.935
OKAY, THE--

14:08.980 --> 14:10.470
THE SHOOTER,
DID--DID HE GET AWAY?

14:10.510 --> 14:13.547
E.T.F.'S DISPATCHED A PROTECTIVE
DETAIL TO THE HOSPITAL.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.070
SHE'LL BE SAFE.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.542
(radio chatter)

14:16.580 --> 14:18.138
WHY CHLOE?

14:18.190 --> 14:19.282
I DON'T KNOW.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.984
YEAH, I COULD HAVE
DRIVEN MYSELF.

14:22.020 --> 14:23.328
WE'D BE THERE ALREADY.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.180
THINK IT'S OKAY
IF WE USE THESE.

14:25.230 --> 14:26.481
(click, siren wailing)

14:26.530 --> 14:28.395
IDENT RECOVERED
FIVE SPENT SHELLS

14:28.430 --> 14:29.897
FROM A HUNTING RIFLE.

14:29.930 --> 14:31.397
THE OTHERS PROBABLY
WENT OVER THE EDGE.

14:31.430 --> 14:32.988
THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR THEM NOW.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.359
ANY RECOVERABLE PRINTS?

14:34.400 --> 14:36.265
SEVERAL SETS ON EACH
OF THE THREE EXIT DOORS,

14:36.300 --> 14:38.336
BUT THEY'RE OLD,
PROBABLY DEGRADED.

14:38.370 --> 14:40.338
I PULLED SECURITY FOOTAGE
FROM THE BUILDING,

14:40.380 --> 14:41.677
BUT IT ONLY COVERS
THE PARKING GARAGE,

14:41.710 --> 14:43.598
LOBBY, AND ELEVATORS.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.470
SO IF HE TOOK THE STAIRS,
WE AIN'T GOT HIM.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.011
EXACTLY.

14:47.050 --> 14:49.075
HOW DO YOU THINK
HE GOT INTO THE BUILDING?

14:49.120 --> 14:51.145
MAINTENANCE CREWS HAVE BEEN
WORKING ON THE FOURTH FLOOR.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.680
THEY PROP THE DOORS OPEN
FOR VENTILATION,

14:52.720 --> 14:54.551
AND THEY'VE BEEN OPEN
ALL WEEK.

14:54.590 --> 14:56.455
SO WHOEVER DID THIS
PUT SOME THOUGHT INTO IT.

14:56.490 --> 14:58.048
(siren whoops,
helicopter blades whirring)

14:58.090 --> 14:59.489
(radio chatter)

14:59.530 --> 15:01.350
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE SEEN HIM
PUT THAT DUMMY OUT THERE,

15:01.400 --> 15:03.561
SO LET'S KEEP ASKING AROUND,
SEE WHAT WE CAN FIND OUT.

15:03.600 --> 15:04.999
OKAY.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.362
(helicopter blades whirring)

15:07.400 --> 15:09.561
OFFICER PRICE
IS STILL IN SURGERY.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.409
I WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL YOU
ANYTHING CERTAIN

15:11.440 --> 15:13.408
FOR A FEW HOURS.
YEAH, BUT--BUT--BUT YOU
MUST KNOW SOMETHING.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.237
I MEAN, IS IT--IS IT
LIFE-THREATENING? IS SHE OKAY?

15:15.280 --> 15:17.009
SHE WAS SHOT IN THE NECK.
I DON'T KNOW HOW,

15:17.050 --> 15:18.278
BUT THE BULLET MANAGED
TO TEAR THROUGH

15:18.310 --> 15:19.675
AND NOT HIT AN ARTERY.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.371
IF I HAD, SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
MADE IT TO THE HOSPITAL.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.512
OKAY, SO WHAT NOW?

15:22.550 --> 15:25.110
NOW WE TRY TO REPAIR
THE DAMAGE.

15:25.150 --> 15:26.708
BUT THERE'S A REAL RISK
OF SWELLING

15:26.750 --> 15:28.559
AGAINST HER SPINAL CORD.

15:28.590 --> 15:31.923
OFFICERS, I PROMISE WE'RE
DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.628
(door opens)

15:34.660 --> 15:37.163
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WHY DON'T WE...

15:37.200 --> 15:38.622
HEAD DOWNSTAIRS
AND GRAB A COFFEE?

15:38.670 --> 15:40.433
NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.
YOU KNOW...

15:40.470 --> 15:42.233
YOU--YOU CAN G0.
I GOT THIS.

15:42.270 --> 15:44.101
YOU SURE? I MEAN, I--
I REALLY DON'T MIND.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.131
I APPRECIATE IT, BUT THERE'S
NOTHING YOU CAN DO HERE.

15:46.170 --> 15:49.276
ALL RIGHT? GET BACK OUT THERE
AND FIND WHOEVER DID THIS.

15:49.310 --> 15:51.005
I'LL CALL YOU
IF ANYTHING CHANGES.

15:58.220 --> 15:59.983
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE TWO OF THEM LAST NIGHT.

16:00.020 --> 16:02.011
WHO?

16:02.060 --> 16:03.357
DOV AND CHLOE.

16:03.390 --> 16:06.427
I MEAN, HE'S LIKE AN IDIOT
FOR HER.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.690
MORE THAN USUAL.

16:08.730 --> 16:11.028
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'S GONNA
DO IF SHE DOESN'T MAKE IT.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.368
OH, SHE, UH...

16:13.400 --> 16:16.130
SHE'S A TOUGH KID.
SHE...

16:16.170 --> 16:17.569
IS GONNA MAKE IT.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.374
(static crackles)
(female dispatcher)

16:20.410 --> 16:23.641

16:32.590 --> 16:35.559
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS...

16:35.590 --> 16:37.558
1312 LOGAN.

16:37.590 --> 16:39.478
IT'S PROBABLY
SOME STUPID HIPSTERS

16:39.530 --> 16:41.418
LIVING IN A CONVERTED LOI-T.

16:41.460 --> 16:44.020
(Oliver) WELL, WELL...

16:44.070 --> 16:46.163

16:48.200 --> 16:51.203
(static crackles)
DISPATCH, THIS IS 1534.

16:51.240 --> 16:54.038
CAN YOU CONFIRM THE ADDRESS
IS 1312 LOGAN AVENUE?

16:54.080 --> 16:57.072
YOU KNOW, PECK, JUST BECAUSE
YOU WOULDN'T LIVE HERE

16:57.110 --> 16:58.509
DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S
THE WRONG ADDRESS.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.518
(gunshot, glass shatters)

17:00.550 --> 17:02.711
GET IN THE CAR!
OLLIE, ARE YOU OKAY?

17:02.750 --> 17:05.241

17:05.290 --> 17:07.588
(gunshots continue)
OFFICERS UNDER FIRE!
REPEAT--OFFICERS UNDER FIRE!

17:07.620 --> 17:09.508
GET DOWN, GET DOWN,
GET DOWN, GET DOWN!

17:09.560 --> 17:11.357
REPEAT--OFFICERS UNDER FIRE!

17:11.390 --> 17:13.824
SHOTS WERE FIRED
EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING!

17:13.860 --> 17:15.396
TELL 'EM WE'RE COVERED!
TELL 'EM WE'RE COVERED!
TAKING COVER!

17:15.430 --> 17:17.364
Copy, 1534...

17:17.400 --> 17:18.662
ARE_YOU HIT?
(static crackles)

17:23.210 --> 17:25.098
FRANK. SWAREK.

17:25.140 --> 17:27.506
CALLAGHAN.

17:27.540 --> 17:29.269
OLIVER AND GAIL--
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT?

17:29.310 --> 17:30.641
THEIR SQUAD
TOOK A FEW HITS.

17:30.680 --> 17:32.170
THEY GOT TO COVER
AND CALLED IT IN.

17:32.210 --> 17:34.212
(Frank) E.T.F. WAS ON SCENE
A FEW MINUTES LATER.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.376
SHOOTER WAS GONE.

17:35.420 --> 17:37.718
IDENT'S RECOVERED SHELLS
FROM AN ABANDONED APARTMENT--

17:37.750 --> 17:39.786
SAME CALIBER
AS THE ROOl-TOP SHOOTER.

17:39.820 --> 17:41.378
AND THE PHONE CALLS?

17:41.420 --> 17:43.559
BOTH 9-1-15 TRACE BACK
TO UNREGISTERED CELL PHONES,

17:43.590 --> 17:46.127
PROBABLY BURNERS.
WE'RE WORKING ON SERIAL NUMBERS,

17:46.160 --> 17:48.196
SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHERE THEY WERE SOLD.

17:48.230 --> 17:49.857
THAT COULD TAKE DAYS.
YEAH, IF WE'RE LUCKY.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.697
BOTH CALLERS WERE MALE.
THE TECH DEPARTMENT--

17:51.730 --> 17:53.493
THEY'RE, UH, VERIFYING TO SEE
IF IT'S THE SAME GUY.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.167
TWO ATTACKS ON YOUR DIVISION.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.667
YOU PISS ANYBODY OFF
RECENTLY?

17:56.700 --> 17:58.509
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO,
WE TOOK DOWN JACKSON IRVING

17:58.540 --> 18:00.508
AND A HANDFUL OF SOLDIERS
IN THE DOWLING CREW.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.337
IRVING GOES TO TRIAL
WEDNESDAY.

18:02.380 --> 18:03.779
GUNS AND GANGS
ARE WORKING THEIR CONTACTS,

18:03.810 --> 18:05.641
TRYING TO SEE WHO'S GONNA
TAKE OVER THE DOWLING CREW.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.773
HUNTING RIFLE DOESN'T REALLY
FEEL LIKE A GANG THING.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.378
YEAH, WE'VE EXPANDED THE LIST
OF POTENTIALS,

18:09.420 --> 18:11.843
STARTING WITH VIOLENT OFFENDERS
AND PSYCHIATRIC CASES.

18:11.890 --> 18:13.778
GOOD. WE'LL ALSO NEED TO ADD
TO THE LIST

18:13.820 --> 18:15.811
ANYONE WHO'S FILED MULTIPLE
COMPLAINS AGAINST THE DIVISION.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.384
THAT'S GONNA BE A LONG LIST.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.421
HALF THE PEOPLE WE BRING IN
FILE BOGUS COMPLAINTS.

18:19.460 --> 18:21.394
SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE'S
TARGETING 15,

18:21.430 --> 18:23.125
SO THIS CASE IS TOP PRIORITY.

18:23.170 --> 18:27.266
SO ANYTHING YOU GUYS NEED,
YOU GOT IT.

18:27.300 --> 18:28.836
(tone chimes, woman speaking
indistinctly over P.A.)

18:28.870 --> 18:30.804
(bottle clunks)
(man) HOW COULD YOU
NOT KNOW ANYTHING?

18:30.840 --> 18:33.138
CHLOE PRICE.
SHE'S A POLICE OFFICER.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.772
(woman) I'M SORRY.
THERE'S NO WORD YET.

18:34.810 --> 18:37.904
CAN I TALK TO SOMEONE
WHO DOES KNOW SOMETHING?
HEY, BUDDY.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.906
TAKE IT EASY.
WHY? YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:39.950 --> 18:42.145
I'M SORRY. WHO ARE YOU?
WES COLE. 27 DIVISION.

18:42.180 --> 18:44.444
CH LOE'S OLD UNIT?

18:44.490 --> 18:46.845
DOV EPSTEIN. 15.
(shakes hand)

18:46.890 --> 18:48.585
HEARD SHE GOT SHOT.
SHE OKAY?

18:48.620 --> 18:50.554
WE DON'T KNOW YET.
SHE'S STILL IN SURGERY.

18:50.590 --> 18:52.729
YOU THERE WHEN IT HAPPENED?
NO, BUT I TALKED
TO THE DOCTOR.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.853
AS IT GOES,
CHLOE WAS PRETTY LUCKY.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.856
NOW WE JUST GOTTA WAIT.
(exhales)

18:56.900 --> 18:58.492
HEARD SOMEONE
CAME AFTER YOU GUYS.

18:58.530 --> 19:00.430
DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS CHLOE
WHO GOT HIT.

19:00.470 --> 19:01.937
YEAH. YOUR STAFF
SEND YOU OVER?

19:01.970 --> 19:05.804
NAH. HOSPITAL SENT ME A MESSAGE
AI-TER SHE WAS BROUGHT IN.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.671
I MUST STILL BE
HER EMERGENCY CONTACT.

19:07.710 --> 19:10.543
EMERGENCY CONTACT? YOU GUYS
MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY CLOSE.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.741
YOU COULD SAY THAT.
SHE'S MY WIFE.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.278
THAT'S PRETTY CLOSE.

19:17.320 --> 19:18.912
YEAH.

19:18.950 --> 19:20.508
I SHOULD GO CHECK
WITH ADMITTING,

19:20.560 --> 19:22.289
SEE IF THEY NEED ME
TO DO ANYTHING.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.451
(monitor beeping steadily)

19:27.500 --> 19:29.525
BY NOW, YOU ALL KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED.

19:29.560 --> 19:33.530
OFFICER PRICE
IS STILL IN SURGERY.

19:33.570 --> 19:36.539
WE HAVE NO FURTHER WORD YET
ON HER CONDITION.

19:36.570 --> 19:38.538
NOW, I KNOW YOU ALL WANT TO BE
AT THE HOSPITAL,

19:38.570 --> 19:40.777
BUT WHOEVER SHOT HER
IS STILL OUT THERE,

19:40.810 --> 19:42.801
AND THEY MAY NOT BE
DONE WITH US.

19:42.840 --> 19:46.947
RIGHT NOW WE'RE BUILDING A LIST
OF POTENTIAL SUSPECT S.

19:46.980 --> 19:48.675
AND AS SOON AS WE FIGURE OUT
WHO DID THIS,

19:48.720 --> 19:50.278
WE'RE GONNA TAKE 'EM DOWN HARD.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.548
THAT'S A PROMISE.

19:51.590 --> 19:52.943
THE OTHER DIVISIONS--

19:52.990 --> 19:55.288
THEY'RE CALLING IN
ALL OFF-DUTY OFFICERS.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.652
WE NEED EVERY AVAILABLE BODY
ON THE STREET.

19:57.690 --> 20:01.228
FROM NOW ON, 9-1-1 CALLS
HAVE AT LEAST 2 CARS RESPOND.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.296
NO EXCEPTIONS.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.368
EVERY OFFICER WHO PUTS ON
THE UNIFORM

20:07.400 --> 20:09.561
UNDERSTANDS THIS IS
A VERY DANGEROUS JOB,

20:09.600 --> 20:12.831
BUT WE DO IT ANYWAY,
BECAUSE THAT'S WHO WE ARE.

20:12.870 --> 20:15.532
SO LET'S GET BACK OUT THERE
SO WE CAN SERVE,

20:15.580 --> 20:17.639
PROTECT.

20:17.680 --> 20:20.274
LET'S ALL COME HOME TONIGHT.

20:25.990 --> 20:29.414
(indistinct conversations,
radio chatter)

20:29.460 --> 20:31.951
(man speaking indistinctly)

20:31.990 --> 20:33.548
HEY.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.953
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.298
OH, I JUST HAD TO DROP OFF
A REPORT.

20:37.330 --> 20:39.696
IT'S A MURDER CASE
FROM A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

20:39.730 --> 20:41.834
DOESN'T THE COURIER USUALLY
BRING THAT STUFF OVER?

20:41.870 --> 20:45.704
YEAH. HE WAS... SICK,
OR SOMETHING.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.229
HEY, COME HERE.

20:54.450 --> 20:56.270
(sets folder down, door closes)

20:56.320 --> 20:58.447
IS IT TRUE? I JUST--
I HEARD A RUMOR

20:58.490 --> 21:00.617
THAT THERE'S SOME FREAK
OUT THERE HUNTING YOU GUYS.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.629
YEAH--HOLLY, I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

21:06.330 --> 21:07.820
THERE'S AN OFFICER
THAT WAS SHOT.

21:07.860 --> 21:10.328
SHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.
AND...

21:10.370 --> 21:13.066
A FEW OTHER OFFICERS
TOOK FIRE.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.863
YOU MEAN YOU.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.891
SOMEONE SHOT AT YOU?

21:16.940 --> 21:19.363
AND--WELL, YOU'RE GONNA GO
BACK OUT THERE?

21:19.410 --> 21:21.833
YEAH, HOLLY...
I-I'M A POLICE OFFICER.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.541
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
YOU HAVE TO GO OUT THERE

21:23.580 --> 21:24.649
AND PUT YOURSELF IN DANGER.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.477
YEAH. KINDA DOES.

21:28.050 --> 21:31.417
O-OKAY. WELL, FINE.

21:31.450 --> 21:34.487

21:34.520 --> 21:36.556
THAT GIRL LAST NIGHT--

21:36.590 --> 21:37.921
I BARELY KNEW HER, OKAY?

21:37.960 --> 21:39.086
IT WAS--IT WAS
A STUPID SETUP.

21:39.130 --> 21:42.691
WELL, ANYWAY, I JUST--
I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

21:42.730 --> 21:43.765
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

21:43.800 --> 21:47.099
I MEAN... I MEAN, WE TELL
EACH OTHER STUFF, RIGHT?

21:47.130 --> 21:49.098
THAT'S WHAT'S SO GREAT,
IS US HANGING OUT,

21:49.140 --> 21:51.461
AND H GUESS THAT'S WHY WHEN
I HEARD WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

21:51.510 --> 21:53.375
I JUST THOUGHT I SHOULD COME
DOWN HERE AND--I DON'T KNOW.

21:53.410 --> 21:56.038
JUST MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY OR SOMETHING.

22:07.790 --> 22:09.951
I'M SORRY.

22:09.990 --> 22:12.379
(exhales)
YOU JUST--YOU JUST
HAD TO STOP TALKING.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.794
(lowered voice) I WON'T
SAY ANOTHER WORD.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.592
YEAH. WELL, YOU COULD CHECK
THE SHELVES ABOVE THE MICROWAVE.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.108
YEAH. (scoffs) NO.

22:25.140 --> 22:27.108
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU MAKING,
ANYWAY, DARLING?

22:27.140 --> 22:29.779
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT MY BUILDING
HAS A NO-POTIONS POLICY.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.971
(door opens)
OKAY. I GOTTA GO.
OKAY, BYE.

22:32.010 --> 22:33.648
PECK...

22:33.680 --> 22:35.113
UH, GONNA ROLL OUT OF HERE
IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

22:35.150 --> 22:36.572
ARE YOU COOL WITH THAT?
YEAH.

22:36.620 --> 22:37.644
(door opens)

22:37.690 --> 22:39.043
OKAY.

22:39.090 --> 22:40.614
HEY.
HEY!

22:40.660 --> 22:42.116
HI.
(door closes)

22:42.160 --> 22:44.458
THAT'S YOUR FRIEND
FROM THE FORENSICS LAB.

22:44.490 --> 22:46.128
THE COURIER WAS SICK,
OLIVER.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.752
IF YOU REALLY MUST KNOW.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.688
WHAT?

22:49.730 --> 22:52.699
(clicks)

22:58.070 --> 22:59.560
A VEST, HUH?

22:59.610 --> 23:02.579
IT LOOKS LIKE, UH,
YOU'RE LEAVING THE STATION.

23:02.610 --> 23:04.805
SWAREK AND CALLAGHAN
HAVE THINGS COVERED HERE.

23:04.850 --> 23:06.704
DETECT IVES FROM EVERY DIVISION
ARE WORKING ON THIS.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.615
WE NEED MORE BODIES
ON THE STREET.

23:08.650 --> 23:09.878
DID FRANK ASK YOU TO GO?

23:09.920 --> 23:11.888
I REQUESTED IT.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.115
LOOKS LIKE
YOU'RE HEADED SOMEWHERE.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.855
IF IT'S THE DOWLING CREW
DOING THIS,

23:15.890 --> 23:17.448
I WOULDN'T ASK MY GUYS
TO RUN THEM DOWN

23:17.490 --> 23:19.458
UNLESS I WAS WILLING
TO DO THE SAME, YOU KNOW?

23:19.490 --> 23:21.594
CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

23:21.630 --> 23:24.121
SINCE YOU'RE GOING OUT ANYWAY,
I CAN USE A PARTNER.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.626
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

23:27.770 --> 23:29.032
I'LL GET MY COAT.

23:29.070 --> 23:31.868
(radio chatter)

23:31.910 --> 23:34.970
(indistinct conversations)

23:35.010 --> 23:37.103
(radio chatter)

23:37.140 --> 23:39.108
ALL RIGHT, THEY'RE BRINGING IN
MORE SQUADS FROM THE GARAGE.

23:39.150 --> 23:41.516
THEY'RE SPLITTING US UP.
YOU GOT 1527.

23:41.550 --> 23:42.972
COOL. THAN KS.

23:43.020 --> 23:45.113
WHAT'S THIS?

23:45.150 --> 23:46.708
OH...

23:46.750 --> 23:48.581
SOME OF THE GUYS IN MY PLATOON
USED TO WRITE STUFF

23:48.620 --> 23:49.985
INSIDE THEIR VEST
BEFORE HEADING OUT--

23:50.020 --> 23:53.956
YOU KNOW, PRAYERS OR MESSAGES
TO LOVED ONES, JUST IN CASE.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.795
YEAH, WELL...

23:56.830 --> 23:58.593
NO ONE ELSE
IS GETTING HURT TODAY.

23:58.630 --> 24:00.666
LET'S HOPE.

24:02.570 --> 24:04.606
HEY.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.460

24:06.510 --> 24:07.807

THAN KS.

24:10.910 --> 24:12.707
(door closes)

24:12.750 --> 24:16.015
(Velcro tearing)

24:16.050 --> 24:17.711
QUARTERMASTER GAVE YOU
A SNAPPY NEW JACKET?

24:17.750 --> 24:19.843
YEAH, ONE OF THE PERKS
OF BEING SHOT, I GUESS.

24:19.890 --> 24:21.209
LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.716
MCNALLY, HOLD UP.

24:22.760 --> 24:24.022
YOU'RE IN FOR THE REST
OF THE SHII-T.

24:24.060 --> 24:26.028
CHECK IN WITH THE D's,
SEE WHAT THEY NEED.

24:26.060 --> 24:27.857
SIR, YOU JUST SAID YOU NEED
EVERY UNIFORM OFFICER

24:27.900 --> 24:30.255
ON THE STREET.
LOOK, I READ THE REPORT.
YOU TOOK A BULLET TODAY,

24:30.300 --> 24:32.860
WHICH MEANS YOU DO NOT GO
OUT THERE, OKAY? BRASS' ORDERS.

24:32.900 --> 24:35.596
IT JUST GRAZED MY JACKET.
I AM FINE.
NOT MY CALL.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.505
YOU'RE OFF PATROL UNTIL
WE CATCH THIS GUY, UNDERSTOOD?

24:37.540 --> 24:38.802
YES, SIR.

24:41.310 --> 24:43.505
I GUESS THE NEW OLD YOU IS
GONNA BE BENCHED FOR A WHILE.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.869
NICK, PLEASE. BE CAREFUL.

24:44.910 --> 24:46.775
I WILL BE.

24:49.780 --> 24:52.089
LOOK, I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.849
I PROMISE.

25:05.870 --> 25:06.996
(engines starting)
(female dispatcher) 9-1-1.

25:07.030 --> 25:08.429
(man) I just saw a couple
fighting in the parking lot

25:08.470 --> 25:10.734
near the bus station...
(male dispatcher) 9-1-1.
What is your emergency?

25:10.770 --> 25:12.704
(sirens wailing)
(woman) There's
a car accident on...

25:12.740 --> 25:14.879
(female dispatcher) 9-1-1.
What is your emergency?
(voices overlapping)

25:14.910 --> 25:16.229
9-1-1.
What is your emergency?

25:24.250 --> 25:27.117
(engine starts)

25:36.260 --> 25:38.660
(truck departing)

25:38.700 --> 25:41.168
SO, ANY LUCK?

25:41.200 --> 25:43.805
WELL, MY GUY SAYS
IRVING'S COUSIN DESMOND

25:43.840 --> 25:45.660
IS CALLING THE SHOTS
FOR THE DOWLING CREW NOW,

25:45.710 --> 25:48.008
BUT APPARENTLY DES ORDERED
EVERYONE TO LAY LOW

25:48.040 --> 25:51.168
FOR A WHILE, SO...
SHOOTING AT POLICE ISN'T
EXACTLY LAYING LOW.

25:51.210 --> 25:53.144
UNLESS IT'S A ROGUE MEMBER.
YEAH, BUT EVEN A ROGUE MEMBER
WOULD KNOW

25:53.180 --> 25:54.977
THAT DEFYING A DIRECT ORDER
WOULD BRING THE CREW

25:55.020 --> 25:56.908
DOWN ON HIM EVEN HARDER
THAN US.

25:56.950 --> 25:58.781
YOU'RE STARTING TO SOUND
LIKE GANG SQUAD.

25:58.820 --> 26:00.754
WELL, YOU SAID YOU NEEDED
A PARTNER TODAY.

26:00.790 --> 26:01.950
(fastens seat belt)

26:01.990 --> 26:04.652
WHY DON'T YOU WANT ME
TO MEET LEO?

26:06.390 --> 26:08.221
UH...

26:08.260 --> 26:12.219
WELL, IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.
(inhales)

26:12.270 --> 26:15.364
IT'S JUST... (exhales)

26:15.400 --> 26:18.631
HE'S BEEN THOUGH A LOT.

26:18.670 --> 26:22.208
AND I DON'T WANT HIM
GETTING ATTACHED TO SOMEONE

26:22.240 --> 26:24.947
UNLESS...

26:24.980 --> 26:26.971
I KNOW THAT IT'S
GOING SOMEWHERE.

26:28.650 --> 26:31.687
OKAY. YEAH. YOU'RE--
YOU'RE PROTECTING YOUR SON.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.210
YOU KNOW, I GET THAT.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.059
BUT, TRACE, YOU KNOW,
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

26:35.090 --> 26:37.957
TH-THIS IS GOING SOMEWHERE.

26:37.990 --> 26:40.754
THAT IS, IF YOU WANT IT TO,
BECAUSE...

26:40.800 --> 26:42.358
(exhales deeply)
I-I DEFINITELY DO.

26:44.400 --> 26:48.860
ONCE WE FIGURE OUT
WHO'S DOING THIS, UM...

26:48.900 --> 26:51.903
MAYBE YOU SHOULD COME OVER
FOR DINNER ONE NIGHT.

26:51.940 --> 26:56.832
(inhales) AND IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO IMPRESS LEO,

26:56.880 --> 27:00.008
YOU SHOULD BRING HIM
A REALLY EXPENSIVE

27:00.050 --> 27:01.312
BOTTLE OF WINE.

27:01.350 --> 27:02.749
(chuckles)

27:02.780 --> 27:06.079
SOMETHING RED,
PREFERABLY DRY.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.678
OH, YEAH? ANYTHING FOR YOU?

27:07.720 --> 27:09.278
LIKE A VIDEOGAME, MAYBE,
OR SOMETHING?

27:09.320 --> 27:11.754
(chuckles) I'LL GIVE YOU A LIST
OF THE ONES I ALREADY HAVE.

27:11.790 --> 27:12.779
RIGHT.
(starts engine)

27:12.830 --> 27:14.229
(laughs)
ALL RIGHT.

27:14.260 --> 27:16.694
(indistinct conversations)

27:16.730 --> 27:18.391
HERE YOU GO.
PATIENT IN 3-C?

27:18.430 --> 27:19.966
_ _ _ YEP. _
(lndlstlnct conversations)

27:20.000 --> 27:21.888
DRUG USE?
I'M GONNA SAY NO.

27:24.210 --> 27:27.771
ALCOHOL?
THAT IS A BIG YES.

27:27.810 --> 27:29.175
UNLESS SHE GAVE THAT UP,
BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE

27:29.210 --> 27:31.201
SHE WOULD DO THAT.
NO, THAT'S STILL A YES.

27:31.250 --> 27:34.947
(chuckles) LAST TETANUS SHOT?
NO CLUE.

27:34.980 --> 27:38.711
CURRENTLY ON ANY MEDICATION?
(huffs) MAN, I DON'T KNOW.

27:38.750 --> 27:41.150
WELL, SHE HAS AN INHALER,
BUT SHE BARELY EVER USES IT.

27:41.190 --> 27:43.351
OH, AND BIRTH CONTROL.

27:43.390 --> 27:45.756
I MEAN... PROBABLY,
YOU KNOW?

27:45.790 --> 27:46.882
CHLOE TALKS A LOT.

27:46.930 --> 27:48.727
HUH. GOT THAT RIGHT, BRO.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.297
(woman speaking indistinctly
on P.A.)

27:51.330 --> 27:53.935
SO YOU GUYS WERE MARRIED?

27:53.970 --> 27:56.461
I MEAN, I GUESS I JUST NEVER
REALLY SAW HER AS THE TYPE.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.162
UH... (exhales) YEAH, THAT WHOLE
THING WAS KINDA CRAZY, MAN.

27:59.210 --> 28:01.303
WE WERE... WE WERE
PARTNERS FOR A WHILE.

28:01.340 --> 28:03.900
THEN WE STARTED SEEING
EACH OTHER ON AND OFF.

28:03.950 --> 28:06.009
AND, UH, THIS ONE WEEK,

28:06.050 --> 28:08.245
WE WERE ON THESE KILLER
BACK-TO-BACK SHIl-TS,

28:08.280 --> 28:10.145
SO WHEN WE WERE DONE,
WE DECIDED

28:10.180 --> 28:12.489
TO BLAST DOWN TO NIAGARA,
BLOW OFF SOME STEAM.

28:12.520 --> 28:15.717
LITTLE GAMBLING,
LOT OF DRINKS.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.853
(laughs)

28:17.890 --> 28:20.859
WE ENDED UP
AT THIS WEDDING CHAPEL,

28:20.900 --> 28:22.458
AND WE'RE WATCHING ALL
THESE COUPLES GET HOOKED UP

28:22.500 --> 28:24.024
AND WE'RE POSING
FOR PICTURES WITH THEM,

28:24.070 --> 28:26.095
THE WHOLE THING.

28:26.130 --> 28:28.496
AND THEN CHLOE'S LIKE,

28:28.540 --> 28:31.100
"LET'S DO IT."

28:31.140 --> 28:33.506
AND... WE DID.

28:33.540 --> 28:36.509
(radio chatter)
(chuckles)

28:36.540 --> 28:38.974
SO IT WASN'T SOME
BIG ROMANTIC THING THEN?

28:39.010 --> 28:40.910
NAH, WE...

28:40.950 --> 28:43.373
WE WERE JUST BEING STUPID.

28:43.420 --> 28:46.241
IT WAS FUN, THOUGH.

28:46.290 --> 28:48.281
YEAH, ME AND CHLOE ALWAYS
HAD A LOT OF FUN.

28:49.820 --> 28:52.220
SHE'S PRETTY GOOD AT THAT.
YEAH.

28:53.830 --> 28:55.388
I SHOULD, UH, I SHOULD
FINISH THIS UP.

28:55.430 --> 28:57.318
YOU WANT ME TO GIVE IT
A SHOT?

28:57.360 --> 29:00.158
BETWEEN THE TWO OF US, WE COULD
PROBABLY ANSWER MOST OF THESE.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.192
SURE.

29:03.240 --> 29:04.969
THAN KS, MAN.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.898
(radio chatter)

29:06.940 --> 29:09.500
(clicks pen, scribbling)

29:09.540 --> 29:12.043
IT'S FUNNY HOW RELATIONSHIPS
START, HUH?

29:12.080 --> 29:14.173
I MEAN, WHO YOU END UP WITH.

29:14.220 --> 29:16.541
SOMETIMES IT'S THE LAST PERSON
THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.548
OH, MY GOD.
OR THAT OTHER PEOPLE
WOULD EXPECT.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.252
WE'RE NOT REALLY HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION, ARE WE?

29:21.290 --> 29:23.110
BUT WHO CARES WHAT PEOPLE
THINK, RIGHT?

29:23.160 --> 29:24.855
AS LONG AS YOU'RE HAPPY.

29:24.890 --> 29:26.323
OF COURSE, IT'S GONNA MEAN
SOME LIFE CHANGES.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.089
(radio chatter)

29:28.130 --> 29:30.189
BUT I GUESS--WELL, I JUST
SAID IT. LIFE CHANGES.

29:30.230 --> 29:32.061
YEAH, SO YOU WANT
TO DATE A WITCH,

29:32.100 --> 29:33.522
YOU KNOW, BUY SOME OLD CABIN

29:33.570 --> 29:35.265
(breathes deeply)
YOU KNOW, BASICALLY
TO IMPRESS HER.

29:35.300 --> 29:36.858
OR Al-TER KNOWING HER

29:36.900 --> 29:38.538
FOR AN INSANELY SHORT
AMOUNT OF TIME,

29:38.570 --> 29:40.401
ASK HER TO MOVE IN WITH HER,
YOU KNOW?

29:40.440 --> 29:43.273
BUT THAT'S OKAY, RIGHT?
BECAUSE SHE MAKES YOU HAPPY.

29:43.310 --> 29:45.039
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU.

29:47.150 --> 29:48.811
WHO DID YOU THINK WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT?

29:48.850 --> 29:50.374
NO.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.741

30:22.780 --> 30:25.146
(lowered voice) WELL, MAYBE
HE JUST WANTS A CLOSER... SHOT.
(cell phone Vibrating)

30:25.190 --> 30:26.441
HE DID MISS US EARLIER.

30:26.490 --> 30:29.414
(vibrating continues)
ARE YOU GONNA GET THAT?

30:29.460 --> 30:32.224

32:19.700 --> 32:21.065
IT'S OKAY.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.692
(both breathing sharply)

32:22.740 --> 32:24.230
IT'S OKAY.

32:26.740 --> 32:30.335
(monitor beeping steadily,
whooshing)

32:39.790 --> 32:41.678
AND DOCTORS THINK THEY'VE
RELIEVED THE PRESSURE

32:41.720 --> 32:43.585
ON HER SPINAL CORD,
BUT...

32:43.620 --> 32:45.349
THEY WON'T KNOW FOR SURE
FOR A FEW DAYS

32:45.390 --> 32:48.097
WHEN THE SWELLING GOES DOWN.

32:48.130 --> 32:50.291
(woman speaking indistinctly
on P.A.)

32:50.330 --> 32:52.264
SO, UH, I SHOULD PROBABLY
CALL MY STAFF,

32:52.300 --> 32:53.699
YOU KNOW, LET 'EM KNOW
SHE'S OUT OF SURGERY.

32:53.730 --> 32:56.039
I WAS ALWAYS CRAZY
ABOUT HER.

32:56.070 --> 32:59.107
ACT ED LIKE I WASN'T,
BUT... (chuckles)

32:59.140 --> 33:02.234
SHE USED TO TURN ME
INSIDE OUT, MAN.

33:02.280 --> 33:04.407
NEVER MET ANYBODY LIKE HER.

33:06.550 --> 33:09.018
WE HAD SOMETHING.
I KNEW. SHE KNEW IT, TOO.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.178
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I LET IT GET AWAY.

33:16.160 --> 33:18.321
MAYBE THIS IS
MY SECOND CHANCE.

33:19.530 --> 33:21.395
(exhales)

33:31.270 --> 33:34.103
THE TECH DEPARTMENT CONFIRMS
THE TWO 9-1-1 CALLERS

33:34.140 --> 33:35.630
ARE THE SAME GUY.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.240
THAT SOUNDS RIGHT TO ME.
I'D SAY HE'S A WHITE MALE,

33:38.280 --> 33:40.100
LATE '305, MAYBE EARLY '405.

33:40.150 --> 33:42.368
WELL, THAT CUTS DOWN OUR
SUSPECT LIST BY ABOUT A THIRD.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.445
THIRD LESS THAN WE HAD
AN HOUR AGO.
(picture rustles)

33:44.490 --> 33:46.242
SEND IT DOWN TO GANGS
AND DRUG SQUAD.
(shouting indistinctly)

33:46.290 --> 33:48.758
SEE IF WE CAN GET A VOICE MATCH
FROM ANYONE ON THEIR WIRES.
(man) PLEASE SETTLE DOWN, MA'AM.

33:48.790 --> 33:50.485
SETTLE DOWN.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.181
REALLY? THAN KS.
(door buzzes)

33:52.230 --> 33:54.391
HEY, CELERY. AN DY.

33:54.430 --> 33:56.057
ANDY. HAVE YOU SEEN OLIVER?

33:56.100 --> 33:57.624
I'VE BEEN CALLING AND CALLING
AND I CAN'T REACH HIM.

33:57.660 --> 34:00.220
YEAH, HE'S ON PATROL.
CAN I HELP YOU WITH SOMETHING?

34:00.270 --> 34:02.761
YEAH, I-I GUESS SO.
I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

34:02.800 --> 34:06.509
I... I CAUGHT SOME GUY HANGING
AROUND OUTSIDE HIS PLACE.

34:06.540 --> 34:08.269
WH-WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
HANGING AROUND?

34:08.310 --> 34:11.768
HE WAS, LIKE, IN A VAN
JUST SITTING OUTSIDE HIS PLACE,

34:11.810 --> 34:13.641
WATCHING HIS HOUSE.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.375
AND, I MEAN, HE WAS THERE
FOR A WHILE,

34:15.420 --> 34:17.376
SO I WENT OUT TO SEE
WHAT HE WANTED.

34:17.420 --> 34:20.787
AND... HE GOT OUT
AND HE, LIKE,

34:20.820 --> 34:22.788
GRABBED ME AND MY ARM.

34:22.820 --> 34:24.526
ARE YOU OKAY?

34:24.560 --> 34:26.687
YEAH, HE JUST KEPT ASKING,
"WHERE'S OLIVER?"

34:26.730 --> 34:28.595
AND HE SAID SOMETHING LIKE,

34:28.630 --> 34:31.724
"HE SHOULD BE HOME BY NOW
BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED."

34:31.770 --> 34:35.661
AND--AND THEN SOME NEIGHBORS
CAME OUT, AND HE JUST TOOK OFF.

34:35.700 --> 34:37.463
BUT DO YOU KNOW
WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT?

34:37.500 --> 34:39.331
LIKE, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO OLIVER? IS HE OKAY?

34:39.370 --> 34:41.372
YEAH--NO, OLIVER IS OKAY.

34:41.410 --> 34:42.775
BUT CAN YOU DESCRIBE
THIS GUY?

34:42.810 --> 34:46.200
UM, YEAH, HE WAS
THIS TALL, WHITE--

34:46.250 --> 34:47.774
UM, HE HAD BROWN HAIR.

34:47.810 --> 34:50.574
UM... SH-SHAGGY BEARD.

34:50.620 --> 34:53.384
AND, UH...
OH, AND HE HAD STITCHES.

34:53.420 --> 34:56.412
STITCHES?
ON HIS HEAD, RIGHT HERE.

34:56.460 --> 34:59.452
(breathing heavily)

35:01.830 --> 35:03.127
YOU GOT TO COME WITH ME.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.195
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
SOME PICTURES.

35:04.230 --> 35:05.766
(door buzzes)
SEE IF YOU RECOGNIZE THEM,
OKAY?

35:09.170 --> 35:11.468
IT'S KEVIN FORD.
WHAT?

35:11.510 --> 35:13.660
THE GUY WE SUSPECTED
OF ABDUCTING CHRISTIAN.

35:13.710 --> 35:15.905
THE GUY WHO WAS ASSAULTED
AT HIS HOUSE TWO WEEKS AGO.
YEAH, YEAH.

35:15.940 --> 35:18.602
I THINK HE'S OUR SHOOTER.
FORD JUST GOT OUT OF
THE HOSPITAL A COUPLE DAYS AGO.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.675
YEAH, AND TODAY HE WENT OVER TO
OLIVER'S HOUSE LOOKING FOR HIM.

35:20.710 --> 35:22.644
SCARED THE HELL
OUT OF HIS GIRLFRIEND.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.511
I MEAN, HE SEEMED TO KNOW
ABOUT THE SHOOTINGS.

35:24.550 --> 35:26.745
IS SHE SURE IT WAS HIM?
SHE I.D.'d HIS PICTURE.
SHE'S POSITIVE.

35:26.790 --> 35:28.758
LOOK, THAT'S TWO ATTACKS TODAY--
ONE OF THEM'S ON OLIVER,

35:28.790 --> 35:30.815
AND THEN FORD GOES OVER
TO OLIVER'S HOUSE

35:30.860 --> 35:33.749
AND IS LOOKING FOR HIM? I MEAN,
THAT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.

35:34.860 --> 35:36.396
IT'S ENOUGH TO GET
A WARRANT.

35:36.430 --> 35:37.897
I'LL GET TEAMS MOVING.

35:37.930 --> 35:40.797
(lowered voice) SAM, IF FORD HAS
A GRUDGE AGAINST 15 DIVISION,

35:40.830 --> 35:42.593
IT'S GOTTA BE
BECAUSE OF MARLO.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.868
I MEAN, SHE STALKED HIM.

35:43.900 --> 35:45.868
SHE TOLD ALL OF HIS NEIGHBORS
THAT HE WAS A CHILD MOLESTER.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.662
SHE GOT HIM ASSAULTED.
(dlallng cell phone)

35:47.710 --> 35:51.498
I MEAN, WHAT IF SHE'S NEXT?
SHE'S AT HER SISTER'S.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.177
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SPOKE WITH HER?

35:53.210 --> 35:55.246
THIS MORNING.

35:56.650 --> 35:58.379
SHE'S NOT PICKING UP.
(beep)

35:59.650 --> 36:01.356
(siren whoops)
(Andy) NICK.

36:01.390 --> 36:03.813
WE THINK THE SHOOTER MIGHT BE
KEVIN FORD AND HE'S Al-TER MARLO.

36:03.860 --> 36:05.350
(siren whoops)
I KNOW.

36:05.390 --> 36:06.880
NO, WE CAN'T REACH HER.

36:06.930 --> 36:08.818
LISTEN, ME AND SAM ARE GONNA
HEAD OVER TO THE SISTER'S PLACE.

36:08.860 --> 36:10.919
CAN YOU GO BY MARLO'S,
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S OKAY?

36:10.960 --> 36:12.825
THANKS.
YOU TOLD HIM
WHAT HAPPENED?

36:12.870 --> 36:14.394
YES, I DID.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.839
(keys jangle)
LET'S GO.

36:15.870 --> 36:18.202
(siren wailing)

36:19.570 --> 36:21.970
(starts engine)

36:22.010 --> 36:23.637
(siren wailing, tires screech)

36:30.880 --> 36:32.848
(turns off engine)

36:40.860 --> 36:43.590
(dog barking in distance)

36:47.900 --> 36:49.834
(unholsters gun)

36:58.480 --> 37:01.608
(radio chatter and static)

37:01.650 --> 37:03.447
OFFICER CRUZ?

37:08.790 --> 37:11.213
OFFICER CRUZ, THIS IS COLLINS!

37:43.060 --> 37:44.459
(holsters gun)

37:46.730 --> 37:48.721
(dials)

37:48.760 --> 37:49.920
(cell phone buzzes)
HEY.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.564
Andy, it's me.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.295
I'M AT MARLO'S PLACE.

37:53.330 --> 37:55.298
SHE'S NOT HERE,
BUT SOMEONE BROKE IN,

37:55.340 --> 37:57.069
TORE THE ENTIRE PLACE APART.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.704
IT'S GOTTA BE FORD.

37:58.740 --> 38:00.298
LOOK, I SHOULD CALL THIS IN,

38:00.340 --> 38:02.035
WAIT FOR THE DETECT IVES
TO GET HERE, BUT...

38:02.080 --> 38:03.707
WHAT?

38:03.740 --> 38:05.446
ANDY, FORD SHOT AT POLICE.
ONCE THEY GET HERE,

38:05.480 --> 38:06.708
THEY'RE GONNA TEAR
MARLO'S HOUSE--

38:06.750 --> 38:08.945
probably her entire life--
apart.

38:16.520 --> 38:17.748
CALL IT IN.
All right.

38:17.790 --> 38:19.485
Be in touch.

38:19.530 --> 38:21.418
IT'S JUST A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE EVERYTHING COMES OUT.

38:21.460 --> 38:22.825
WE'LL DEAL WITH THAT
WHEN AND IF IT HAPPENS.

38:22.860 --> 38:24.589
RIGHT NOW WE JUST GOTTA
MAKE SURE EVERYONE'S SAFE.

38:24.630 --> 38:26.621
I MEAN, EVEN IF HE'S Al-TER
MARLO, THERE'S NO WAY

38:26.670 --> 38:28.331
HE COULD KNOW THAT SHE'S
STAYING AT HER SISTER'S, RIGHT?

38:28.370 --> 38:31.498
(radio chatter)

38:31.540 --> 38:33.462
SHE LEI-T A NOTE.

38:33.510 --> 38:34.909
WHERE?
SHE LEI-T A NOTE
FOR THE NEIGHBOR

38:34.940 --> 38:36.373
WHO'S TAKING CARE
OF HER PLACE.

38:36.410 --> 38:37.775
IT HAD
HER CONTACT INFORMATION.

38:37.810 --> 38:39.402
IF HE SAW IT, HE'D KNOW
WHERE TO FIND HER.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.613
OKAY, I'M GONNA TRY HER
AGAIN.
(buttons clicking)

38:42.650 --> 38:44.117
(vibrating faintly)

38:44.150 --> 38:47.347

s'ouvre a ta voix" playing)

38:52.890 --> 38:54.892

38:54.930 --> 38:57.922

39:48.850 --> 39:51.148

39:55.120 --> 39:57.088
(pound on door)
(Swarek) MARLO!

39:57.120 --> 39:59.122
OH, SAM!

39:59.160 --> 40:01.048
MCNALLY?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

40:01.090 --> 40:02.648
WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHY DIDN'T
YOU PICK UP YOUR PHONE?

40:04.160 --> 40:05.923
MY SISTER'S AT WORK,
AND I TURNED EVERYTHING OFF

40:05.970 --> 40:07.460
SO I COULD TAKE A REST.
(sighs)

40:07.500 --> 40:08.865
WHAT IS GOING ON?
(clatter)

40:08.900 --> 40:11.733
(radio chatter)
SOMEONE'S COMING AFTER
15 DIVISION.

40:11.770 --> 40:12.964
PRICE GOT SHOT TODAY.

40:13.010 --> 40:16.002
OH, MY GOD. IS SHE OKAY?
WE DON'T KNOW YET.

40:16.040 --> 40:17.337
COME ON, UH, WE GOTTA GET
YOU BACK TO THE STATION,

40:17.380 --> 40:19.143
ALL RIGHT? GET DRESSED.
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

40:19.180 --> 40:21.569
SOMEONE'S COMING AI-TER 15?
IT'S KEVIN FORD.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.110
FORD? NO, IT CAN'T BE.

40:23.150 --> 40:24.981
WELL, WE--WE DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE, OKAY?

40:25.020 --> 40:26.988
JUST--WE GOT TEAMS ALL OVER
THE CITY LOOKING FOR HIM.

40:27.020 --> 40:29.056
HE'S A PERVERT, BUT HE'S NOT
GONNA SHOOT AT ANYBODY.

40:29.090 --> 40:32.582
I MEAN, THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
WELL, UNLESS SOMEBODY
REALLY PISSED HIM OFF.

40:32.630 --> 40:33.983
COME ON.
LET'S GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

40:34.030 --> 40:36.089
COME ON.
DO YOU REALLY THINK
HE'S COMING Al-TER ME?

40:36.130 --> 40:40.123
HE'S ALREADY BEEN TO YOUR PLACE.
HE KNEW YOU WERE FOLLOWING HIM.

40:40.170 --> 40:43.059
PRETTY SOON, A WHOLE LOT OF
OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT KNOW, TOO.

40:44.610 --> 40:47.465
Collins, it's, uh, Shaw.
You still on scene?

40:47.510 --> 40:49.705
THAT'S RIGHT. I'M JUST WAITING
FOR BACKUP TO ARRIVE.

40:49.740 --> 40:52.504
Okay, great. Sit tight.
I'm on my way.

41:05.060 --> 41:06.618
(clicks)

41:29.650 --> 41:32.710
(radio chatter)

41:41.190 --> 41:43.090
OFFICER SHAW.

41:43.130 --> 41:46.065
TURN BACK AROUND,
OR I WILL DROP YOU RIGHT HERE!

41:48.030 --> 41:49.133
FORD--

41:49.170 --> 41:51.263
YOU SET ME UP.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.858
YOU ALL SET ME UP.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.605
YOU KNOW WHAT?
PUT YOUR GUN DOWN,

41:54.640 --> 41:56.278
AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS.
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THIS.

41:56.310 --> 41:57.902
NO.
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

41:57.940 --> 42:00.079
NO, I'M DONE TALKING.

42:00.110 --> 42:02.010
(grunts)
