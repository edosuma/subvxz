<i>Previously on Gotham... </i>

00:02.516 --> 00:04.281
ALFRED: <i> This is Reginald Payne.</i>

00:04.297 --> 00:05.864
- We served together, sir.
- Please feel free

00:05.899 --> 00:07.132
to stay with us a few days.

00:07.167 --> 00:08.967
You're stealing from us?

00:12.972 --> 00:16.041
Arnold Flass, you're under arrest
for the murder of Leon Winkler.

00:16.075 --> 00:18.444
I.A. ruled it a suicide.

00:18.478 --> 00:19.745
Arnold Flass, you're under arrest.

00:19.779 --> 00:21.413
I'm protected.

00:21.448 --> 00:24.249
MAN: <i>So you're the one
causing</i> all of the fuss.

00:24.284 --> 00:25.918
MOONEY: <i>You will take</i>

00:25.952 --> 00:28.620
- nothing from me.
- Really?

00:28.655 --> 00:30.022
(grunts)

00:30.056 --> 00:32.223
- (screaming)
- No! (shouts)

00:33.890 --> 00:35.224
He has nothing concrete.

00:35.258 --> 00:38.093
Now's the time to make a move on the kid.

00:42.766 --> 00:44.767
(woman speaking indistinctly over P.A.)

00:46.770 --> 00:49.071
Slim pickings at the food court.

00:49.105 --> 00:51.707
- Brought you a bagel.
- Thanks.

00:51.741 --> 00:54.209
- Nothing for the invalid?
- (chuckles)

00:54.244 --> 00:56.745
- (phone vibrating)
- Sorry. Hospital food only.

00:56.780 --> 00:59.148
- Doctor's orders. How you feeling?
- All right.

00:59.182 --> 01:01.150
Had a slight... puncture.

01:01.184 --> 01:03.052
Leaked a bit.

01:03.086 --> 01:04.819
So I know last night
must be kind of a blur,

01:04.854 --> 01:06.388
but do you have any idea who did this?

01:06.423 --> 01:07.690
BRUCE: It-it was...

01:07.724 --> 01:08.824
It was dark. It was very dark.

01:08.858 --> 01:10.993
Saw a...

01:11.027 --> 01:14.363
shadow and... my savior Master Bruce

01:14.397 --> 01:16.365
was leaning over me.

01:16.399 --> 01:17.900
Did you get a look at the guy?

01:17.934 --> 01:19.568
No.

01:19.603 --> 01:21.870
(phone vibrating)

01:21.905 --> 01:25.341
Sorry. My captain keeps calling.

01:25.375 --> 01:26.875
ALFRED: It's fine, Detective.

01:26.910 --> 01:29.178
- Just-just go.
- No, I can stay.

01:29.212 --> 01:31.247
I really appreciate you
sitting with Master Bruce,

01:31.281 --> 01:34.016
but as you can see, I'm completely fine.

01:34.050 --> 01:36.018
- (phone vibrating)
- Go.

01:36.052 --> 01:37.786
(sighs) All right.

01:37.821 --> 01:39.955
I'll try and stop by later.

01:39.990 --> 01:42.391
Thank you again for coming, Detective.

01:49.099 --> 01:51.734
Why not tell him the truth?

01:51.768 --> 01:53.969
Well, believe it or not,

01:54.004 --> 01:55.304
Master Bruce, Reggie's a mate,

01:55.338 --> 01:57.273
and you don't set coppers
on your mates, do you?

01:57.307 --> 01:59.008
But he nearly killed you.

01:59.042 --> 02:00.476
I served with that bastard.

02:00.510 --> 02:02.645
Anyone sorts him out,
it's me... Nobody else.

02:02.679 --> 02:03.946
It wouldn't be right.

02:03.980 --> 02:05.948
Why would he stab you?

02:05.982 --> 02:08.217
That's a bloody good question.

02:08.251 --> 02:10.619
And one... (grunts)

02:10.654 --> 02:12.588
I mean to find out.

02:12.622 --> 02:14.890
(heart monitor beeping)

02:14.925 --> 02:16.725
(grunts)

02:16.760 --> 02:20.429
'Cause longer that bloody
lunatic's out on the loose...

02:20.463 --> 02:22.264
(grunts)

02:22.299 --> 02:24.099
the harder it's gonna be to find him.

02:24.134 --> 02:25.601
Now, you just...

02:25.635 --> 02:27.169
(gasps)

02:27.203 --> 02:29.238
G-Get back in bed, Alfred.

02:29.272 --> 02:32.708
- Just pass me my robe.
- Get back in bed!

02:34.811 --> 02:37.313
That's an order.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:48.525 --> 02:51.160
MAN: Ah.

02:51.194 --> 02:53.429
You're awake.

02:53.463 --> 02:55.631
Wonderful.

02:55.665 --> 02:57.566
(sighs) How long have I been...

02:57.601 --> 03:00.669
Asleep? Just since last night.

03:00.704 --> 03:03.272
How do you feel?

03:03.306 --> 03:06.675
- My head hurts.
- To be expected.

03:06.710 --> 03:09.345
May I?

03:09.379 --> 03:12.114
(groans) Who are you?

03:12.148 --> 03:14.850
Dr. Francis Dulmacher.

03:14.885 --> 03:17.353
Founder of this facility.

03:17.387 --> 03:19.688
A pleasure.

03:19.723 --> 03:21.090
(chuckles)

03:21.124 --> 03:23.859
I've gone to great lengths
to meet you, Doctor.

03:23.894 --> 03:25.628
Indeed you have.

03:25.662 --> 03:29.365
I must say you have a
remarkable constitution.

03:29.399 --> 03:32.368
I wish I could say the
same of all my patients.

03:32.402 --> 03:36.138
Oh. So I'm a patient now?
No longer a prisoner?

03:36.173 --> 03:38.574
I confess I don't know what you are.

03:38.608 --> 03:41.210
You seize control of the basement,

03:41.244 --> 03:43.812
take one of my guards hostage,

03:43.847 --> 03:47.283
then scoop out your own eye.

03:47.317 --> 03:49.185
What am I to do with you?

03:49.219 --> 03:52.454
Simple. Make me your right hand.

03:52.489 --> 03:53.923
(laughs)

03:53.957 --> 03:56.325
I'm glad to see you've
retained your sense of humor.

03:56.359 --> 03:58.327
I'm not joking.

03:58.361 --> 04:02.164
For the past ten years,
I've been Carmine Falcone's

04:02.199 --> 04:03.532
top lieutenant.

04:03.567 --> 04:05.468
I'm afraid the name means nothing to me.

04:07.504 --> 04:11.240
I woke up hungry and alone
in an underground cell.

04:11.274 --> 04:15.211
In less than a week, I brought
this place to a standstill.

04:15.245 --> 04:17.213
Now, you've had me as your enemy.

04:17.247 --> 04:20.015
Wouldn't you rather have me as your friend?

04:20.050 --> 04:22.051
Such vim.

04:22.084 --> 04:24.620
Such... panache.

04:24.654 --> 04:26.889
Bravo.

04:26.923 --> 04:29.258
And now you should eat.

04:29.292 --> 04:31.227
I'll have a nurse come in with some food.

04:31.261 --> 04:33.362
We'll talk more later.

04:33.396 --> 04:35.865
Tricky things, eyes.

04:35.899 --> 04:38.868
Our stock is frightfully low at the moment.

04:38.902 --> 04:40.536
Oh, and apologies.

04:40.570 --> 04:44.106
We couldn't match your original color.

04:44.141 --> 04:46.142
We'll talk soon.

04:49.980 --> 04:52.648
(door opens, closes)

04:54.050 --> 04:55.951
(heart monitor beeping)

05:10.700 --> 05:12.701
(gasping)

05:21.945 --> 05:23.412
GORDON: This can't be true.

05:23.447 --> 05:24.980
I was prepping the case for the D.A.

05:25.015 --> 05:26.649
when word came down this morning.

05:26.683 --> 05:28.484
Press got it last night, of course.

05:28.518 --> 05:30.653
We had the murder weapon.

05:30.687 --> 05:32.188
With Flass's prints.

05:32.222 --> 05:33.322
There's no way.

05:33.356 --> 05:34.990
Apparently, the defense dug up a witness,

05:35.025 --> 05:36.859
cleared Flass of all charges.

05:36.893 --> 05:38.627
- What witness?
- DENT: No idea.

05:38.662 --> 05:40.329
Only the judge and the
lead attorneys were privy,

05:40.364 --> 05:43.466
and our honorable D.A. is staying mum.

05:43.500 --> 05:44.867
What about a subpoena?

05:44.901 --> 05:46.202
We don't have sufficient grounds.

05:46.236 --> 05:48.471
But I did a little snooping around.

05:48.505 --> 05:50.172
- And?
- The mystery witness

05:50.207 --> 05:52.575
was provided by Commissioner Loeb.

05:54.578 --> 05:56.779
Let me guess.

05:56.813 --> 05:59.115
Loeb's reinstating Flass as head of Narco.

05:59.149 --> 06:00.349
ESSEN: Worse.

06:00.384 --> 06:02.351
He announced he's backing
Flass for president

06:02.386 --> 06:04.987
of the policemen's union
in the upcoming election.

06:05.022 --> 06:07.223
So you're telling me a man
we know is a drug dealer

06:07.257 --> 06:09.392
and a murderer is gonna potentially hold

06:09.426 --> 06:10.860
a major position in the GCPD?

06:10.894 --> 06:12.828
Clearly, Loeb's sending a message.

06:12.863 --> 06:15.031
This is not gonna stand.

06:15.065 --> 06:16.832
Look, I'm just as upset
about this as you are, Jim,

06:16.867 --> 06:18.134
but it's the commissioner.

06:18.168 --> 06:21.037
Which is what makes it worse.

06:21.071 --> 06:23.572
Jim! Jim!

06:29.913 --> 06:31.580
Jimbo.

06:31.615 --> 06:34.383
You heard the good news?

06:34.418 --> 06:37.386
Hey, the boys are throwing me a
welcome back down at O'Donnelys.

06:37.421 --> 06:39.889
Figure you want to stop by.

06:39.923 --> 06:43.592
Show support for your
soon-to-be new president.

06:43.627 --> 06:45.561
I wouldn't celebrate just yet.

06:45.595 --> 06:47.930
You just don't learn.

06:47.965 --> 06:50.866
Still want to take me down.

06:50.901 --> 06:53.603
I'm like the phoenix.

06:53.637 --> 06:55.004
I'll just rise

06:55.038 --> 06:59.208
again and again and again.

07:05.282 --> 07:06.716
Ah, Detective Gordon.

07:06.750 --> 07:10.386
I had a presentiment I might be seeing you.

07:10.420 --> 07:12.455
Arnold Flass is a murderer.

07:12.489 --> 07:13.756
He belongs in jail.

07:13.790 --> 07:15.925
Detective Flass was legally exonerated.

07:15.959 --> 07:19.729
The judge heard testimony.
The case is closed.

07:21.098 --> 07:25.034
You used your connections
to orchestrate his release.

07:25.068 --> 07:27.403
You perverted the system.

07:27.437 --> 07:30.139
Petulance and naivetÃ©
are a bad combination.

07:30.173 --> 07:32.775
Know when you're beaten.

07:32.809 --> 07:35.778
I was knee-deep in the
Flass investigation.

07:35.812 --> 07:37.947
There is no one with enough credibility

07:37.981 --> 07:40.750
to trump our evidence.

07:40.784 --> 07:43.920
I do enjoy when unwavering certainty

07:43.954 --> 07:46.923
is undermined by the truth.

07:48.959 --> 07:50.493
MAN: Look into the camera, state your name

07:50.527 --> 07:51.794
and why you're here.

07:51.828 --> 07:54.564
BULLOCK: My name is
Detective Harvey Bullock,

07:54.598 --> 07:57.333
and I presented false
evidence against my fellow

07:57.367 --> 08:00.369
GCPD detective, Arnold Flass.

08:09.413 --> 08:11.400
BULLOCK: Hey, there you are. Aw, dude.

08:11.438 --> 08:13.906
Feel like a herd of cattle had a
dance party in my head last night.

08:13.940 --> 08:15.141
What's up?

08:15.175 --> 08:17.491
Why the hell would you
lie to exonerate Flass?

08:19.704 --> 08:21.871
Don't deny it. I saw the tape.

08:21.906 --> 08:23.640
I'm not denying anything.

08:23.674 --> 08:25.875
I did what I had to do.

08:25.910 --> 08:29.579
If I didn't do what Loeb told
me to do, I would've lost my job.

08:29.614 --> 08:31.548
Probably gone to prison.

08:31.582 --> 08:33.850
What does he have on you?

08:33.884 --> 08:35.318
Harvey.

08:35.352 --> 08:37.419
Do you honestly think you're
the only one who had the orders

08:37.455 --> 08:39.356
to take a punk down to the end of a pier

08:39.390 --> 08:41.924
and put a bullet in his head? Huh?

08:41.958 --> 08:47.264
The difference is my
Cobblepot didn't come back.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.434
Who'd you kill?

08:51.469 --> 08:53.570
Some scumbag mobster.

08:53.604 --> 08:55.605
Caught him coming out of a club one night.

08:55.640 --> 08:58.375
My sergeant put a gun in my
hand, held another to my head,

08:58.409 --> 09:00.043
and said, "Make a choice."

09:00.077 --> 09:02.612
I decided to keep breathing.

09:02.647 --> 09:04.714
Damn it, Harvey.

09:04.749 --> 09:06.216
So what?

09:06.250 --> 09:08.218
What are you gonna do? Arrest
me? Go ahead. Arrest me.

09:08.252 --> 09:09.686
But don't stop there.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.688
Half the cops in the GCPD have a Cobblepot,

09:11.722 --> 09:14.758
and Loeb has the goods on all of them.

09:14.792 --> 09:16.293
That is what Loeb does.

09:16.327 --> 09:18.728
Well, it ends now.

09:18.763 --> 09:20.697
Jim, hey.

09:20.731 --> 09:22.933
Going after Flass was bad enough.

09:22.967 --> 09:25.502
Going after Loeb is
suicide, plain and simple.

09:25.536 --> 09:26.703
So what?

09:26.737 --> 09:27.804
Am I supposed to stay quiet?

09:27.838 --> 09:29.239
Fall in line like the rest of you?

09:29.273 --> 09:31.474
That would be a good idea.

09:31.509 --> 09:34.945
Day I do that is the
day I quit being a cop.

09:46.290 --> 09:48.258
(gasps) Oh, my.

09:48.292 --> 09:49.993
Fun fact. (chuckles)

09:50.027 --> 09:52.395
The human species attracts
members of the opposite sex

09:52.430 --> 09:53.630
via pheromones

09:53.664 --> 09:55.465
secreted through saliva, sweat and urine.

09:55.499 --> 09:56.933
Gross.

09:56.968 --> 10:00.437
But... one can't always trust
such an animalistic method

10:00.471 --> 10:02.272
to find a suitable partner.

10:02.306 --> 10:04.241
What are you trying to tell me?

10:04.275 --> 10:06.676
Arnold Flass was released.

10:06.711 --> 10:08.645
I know that you two were dating,

10:08.679 --> 10:10.413
and if the attraction
wasn't intellectual...

10:10.448 --> 10:11.982
How could it be with that gorilla?...

10:12.016 --> 10:13.683
Then it must be physical.

10:13.718 --> 10:17.254
He's just... he's such a bad,

10:17.288 --> 10:19.823
- bad, bad... 
- I appreciate your concern.

10:19.857 --> 10:21.658
But it won't be necessary.

10:21.692 --> 10:25.862
I've realized there are
far better men in the world

10:25.896 --> 10:27.397
than Arnold Flass.

10:35.806 --> 10:39.509
DENT: <i> So Loeb's been collecting</i>
<i>dirt on cops for years</i>

10:39.543 --> 10:41.711
<i>and using it to
control the department.</i>

10:41.746 --> 10:43.546
I doubt it stops there.

10:43.581 --> 10:48.051
He's probably got leverage
on businessmen, politicians.

10:48.085 --> 10:51.388
He's got nothing on me.

10:51.422 --> 10:53.023
Just checking.

10:53.057 --> 10:56.359
Anyway, yeah, that's the
source of all his power.

10:56.394 --> 10:59.462
And you want to steal the dragon's gold.

10:59.497 --> 11:02.165
If we find his cache of
evidence and destroy it,

11:02.199 --> 11:03.967
he'll be toothless.

11:04.001 --> 11:06.870
Oh, I know Loeb.

11:06.904 --> 11:09.306
He won't keep it anywhere obvious.

11:09.340 --> 11:11.007
We could watch him, hope he leads us to it.

11:11.042 --> 11:12.409
We don't have that kind of time.

11:12.443 --> 11:15.210
Isn't there someone
Loeb might have trusted?

11:16.714 --> 11:19.482
Ex-friends? An estranged wife?

11:19.517 --> 11:21.484
Well, he was married.

11:21.519 --> 11:23.887
She died 20 years ago.

11:23.921 --> 11:25.689
Fell down the stairs.

11:25.723 --> 11:27.591
Well, there were rumors Loeb killed her,

11:27.625 --> 11:30.694
but nothing ever happened with it.

11:30.728 --> 11:33.430
Still can't believe about your partner.

11:33.464 --> 11:36.333
Why'd he do it? What's Loeb have on him?

11:36.367 --> 11:39.703
I don't know.

11:39.737 --> 11:41.338
Well, it's got to be rough.

11:41.372 --> 11:44.374
I know how it is with
cops and their partners.

11:48.479 --> 11:49.746
What is it?

11:53.618 --> 11:55.085
What's the matter, Dent?

11:55.119 --> 11:57.020
I thought that Lambusta case was settled.

11:57.054 --> 11:59.022
And why the hell are we meeting here?

11:59.056 --> 12:00.757
You'll see.

12:00.791 --> 12:02.192
You know Jim Gordon?

12:02.226 --> 12:04.561
What the hell's going on?

12:04.595 --> 12:06.630
Have a seat.

12:08.132 --> 12:11.368
DENT: Back before Loeb was commissioner,

12:11.402 --> 12:15.305
when he was a lowly homicide
dick, you were his partner.

12:15.339 --> 12:17.941
Yeah? That was 20 years ago.

12:17.975 --> 12:20.910
But I always hear that cop
partnerships are like marriages.

12:20.945 --> 12:23.446
You know each other better than your wives.

12:23.481 --> 12:25.148
Isn't that right, Jim?

12:25.182 --> 12:27.384
That's right.

12:27.418 --> 12:30.387
You digging up that old story
about Loeb killing his wife?

12:30.421 --> 12:32.589
He was with me when she died.

12:32.623 --> 12:35.792
We know about the secret files.

12:35.826 --> 12:37.227
What secret files?

12:37.261 --> 12:38.561
DENT: Oh, that was good.

12:38.596 --> 12:40.297
I almost believed him.

12:40.331 --> 12:42.799
- What about you, Jim?
- No.

12:42.833 --> 12:45.502
You're out of your depth, kid. Both of you.

12:45.536 --> 12:48.171
Swim back to shore.

12:50.308 --> 12:52.676
He's got something on you, too, doesn't he?

12:57.014 --> 12:59.316
He got you to do something for him.

12:59.350 --> 13:00.583
What was it?

13:00.618 --> 13:04.087
Robbery? Coercion?

13:04.121 --> 13:07.524
Murder?

13:07.558 --> 13:09.659
And all this time, he's been using it

13:09.694 --> 13:12.662
to keep you under his thumb.

13:12.697 --> 13:16.132
This is your chance to breathe easy again.

13:16.167 --> 13:19.169
Take it, Griggs.

13:19.203 --> 13:22.539
I don't know what you
two are talking about.

13:22.573 --> 13:25.141
If I did, I'd say talk to Xi Lu.

13:25.176 --> 13:27.421
Chinese bookkeeper on Huron Street.

13:28.108 --> 13:31.281
Loeb always said you want
to keep something safe,

13:31.315 --> 13:34.384
you give it to Xi Lu.

13:38.256 --> 13:40.390
You want to bring in Bullock?

13:40.424 --> 13:42.626
We might need him.

13:42.660 --> 13:44.160
No.

13:46.597 --> 13:48.098
Thanks, Joe.

13:52.937 --> 13:54.537
I mean it.

13:54.572 --> 13:56.239
I like the blue.

13:56.274 --> 13:57.741
I'm so pleased.

13:57.775 --> 14:00.043
Happy patient, happy doctor.

14:00.077 --> 14:02.646
Ah. Mrs. Harris.

14:02.680 --> 14:04.314
(muffled): Hello, Doctor.

14:04.348 --> 14:07.017
Don't forget... jazz
at 6:00 on the veranda,

14:07.051 --> 14:09.085
but no martinis until the
bandages come off, yes?

14:09.120 --> 14:10.654
(muffled mumble)

14:10.688 --> 14:13.023
Good girl.

14:16.060 --> 14:18.228
Kidney transplant.

14:18.262 --> 14:21.698
We threw in a new face for
free, and none too soon.

14:21.732 --> 14:23.533
But you need a steady supply of organs.

14:23.568 --> 14:24.868
Yes.

14:24.902 --> 14:27.110
Which is suddenly something
of a problem, thanks to you.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.406
But I'm also a solution.

14:29.440 --> 14:31.608
The people in the basement trust me.

14:31.642 --> 14:33.577
Put me in charge,

14:33.611 --> 14:37.280
and I promise you a dependable
flow of healthy product.

14:37.315 --> 14:39.549
Or I could save myself the trouble

14:39.584 --> 14:41.351
and kill you and everyone downstairs.

14:41.385 --> 14:42.686
(clicks tongue)

14:42.720 --> 14:46.389
Now, if that were an option,
you would have done it already,

14:46.424 --> 14:49.092
and you surely wouldn't have
wasted this beautiful eye

14:49.126 --> 14:50.894
on little old me.

14:50.928 --> 14:53.897
I'd like to show you something.

14:53.931 --> 14:55.799
(door creaks)

14:55.833 --> 14:59.269
People view themselves as
unique, self-contained systems,

14:59.303 --> 15:02.405
but we are merely a collection of parts.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.141
What happens when I replace your eyes,

15:05.176 --> 15:07.444
your face, your heart?

15:07.478 --> 15:10.780
When do you stop being you
and become something new?

15:10.815 --> 15:13.116
That's what fascinates me.

15:13.150 --> 15:15.552
Nice talk.

15:15.586 --> 15:18.054
Do we have a deal?

15:19.090 --> 15:21.725
Conditionally.

15:21.759 --> 15:23.627
I will send you back to the basement,

15:23.661 --> 15:25.996
you will retrieve my
guard, and then prove to me

15:26.030 --> 15:28.632
that you can provide me with the bodies.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.267
A test.

15:32.270 --> 15:35.438
And if I fail?

15:35.473 --> 15:39.609
Oh, those who fail me
still have their uses.

15:39.644 --> 15:41.611
(heart monitor beeping steadily)

15:41.646 --> 15:44.648
You may remember my former office manager.

15:51.923 --> 15:53.924
(whimpering softly)

16:00.898 --> 16:03.466
(coughing)

16:03.501 --> 16:05.602
(screaming)

16:08.472 --> 16:10.640
Amusing, no?

16:10.675 --> 16:13.143
(screaming)

16:19.634 --> 16:21.134
BRUCE: <i> "And then I
looked</i> <i>at the stars,</i>

16:21.171 --> 16:23.573
<i>"and considered how awful
it would be for a man</i>

16:23.607 --> 16:26.509
"to turn his face up to
them as he froze to death,

16:26.543 --> 16:29.312
and see no help or pity in
the glittering multitude... "

16:29.346 --> 16:31.948
(laughs)

16:31.982 --> 16:34.116
That's cheerful.

16:35.481 --> 16:37.482
What are you doing here?

16:37.517 --> 16:39.484
Ivy sneaks in a few times a week.

16:39.519 --> 16:41.887
Steals food from the sickies.

16:41.921 --> 16:43.989
She spotted you.

16:45.024 --> 16:46.958
He okay?

16:54.634 --> 16:56.635
I'm sorry.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.376
Thanks.

17:06.773 --> 17:09.108
Alfred was stabbed.

17:09.143 --> 17:11.912
It was a friend of his from the army.

17:11.945 --> 17:14.915
Wow. That sucks.

17:14.949 --> 17:17.851
I think he was there because of me.

17:17.885 --> 17:19.118
What are you talking about?

17:19.153 --> 17:20.387
I had a meeting with the board

17:20.421 --> 17:22.923
of Wayne Enterprises to tell them I was

17:22.957 --> 17:25.058
investigating them, so they sent someone

17:25.092 --> 17:27.193
- we'd trust to spy on us.
- What was he looking for?

17:27.228 --> 17:28.595
Some of my files were missing.

17:28.629 --> 17:30.196
I think the other things he stole

17:30.231 --> 17:32.265
were just cover.

17:32.300 --> 17:36.236
If I find him, I could
find out who hired him.

17:36.270 --> 17:38.205
He's-he's the key to everything.

17:38.239 --> 17:41.107
You're gonna track him down? Really? You?

17:41.142 --> 17:43.743
I-I have to.

17:43.778 --> 17:46.112
This... this is my fault.

17:46.147 --> 17:47.547
Kid, you're out of your mind.

17:47.582 --> 17:50.116
Look at him. Is that
how you want to end up?

17:53.363 --> 17:56.122
I don't expect you to understand.

17:56.157 --> 17:58.058
- I'll help.
- No.

17:58.092 --> 18:01.328
I can't risk anybody else
getting hurt on account of me.

18:01.362 --> 18:03.263
You know how to find me.

18:05.299 --> 18:07.300
(lively chatter)

18:31.392 --> 18:34.361
(machines clicking rapidly)

18:38.966 --> 18:40.400
Xi Lu?

18:54.749 --> 18:57.451
Detective Gordon, GCPD.

18:57.485 --> 19:00.020
We have a few questions
we'd like to ask you.

19:00.054 --> 19:01.988
Is there somewhere we can talk in private?

19:03.991 --> 19:06.059
Ask your questions, Detective.

19:06.093 --> 19:09.529
It's about Commissioner Loeb.

19:09.564 --> 19:12.732
We understand you two have
a business relationship?

19:12.767 --> 19:15.836
I do not know Commissioner Loeb.

19:15.870 --> 19:18.839
Listen, old man, we can have a dozen ADAs

19:18.873 --> 19:20.574
and cops here in ten minutes.

19:20.608 --> 19:23.143
They'll confiscate every
dollar in this place,

19:23.177 --> 19:24.644
and you will go to jail.

19:24.679 --> 19:27.080
(phone vibrating)

19:32.420 --> 19:33.587
Hmm.

19:39.093 --> 19:42.329
(laughs)

19:42.363 --> 19:44.731
Your name is Gordon.

19:44.766 --> 19:49.002
- That's right.
- And you are Dent.

19:49.036 --> 19:50.771
Yes.

19:50.805 --> 19:52.806
Wait here.

19:53.675 --> 19:55.350
(speaks Chinese)

19:58.573 --> 19:59.707
Okay. Not good.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.075
GORDON: GCPD!

20:01.109 --> 20:02.376
Drop your weapons now!

20:02.410 --> 20:04.778
- Gordon... 
- Yeah, run!

20:07.582 --> 20:08.949
(men shouting)

20:20.762 --> 20:22.363
(men shouting)

20:31.306 --> 20:32.573
(men shouting)

20:37.078 --> 20:39.446
(tires screech)

20:39.481 --> 20:40.514
Get in!

20:43.318 --> 20:44.552
(tires screeching)

20:47.722 --> 20:50.491
(shouting continues)

21:02.804 --> 21:05.072
We got to go back there.
You've got to call backup.

21:05.106 --> 21:06.982
Forget it! The place will be
cleaned out in five minutes.

21:07.019 --> 21:09.543
- Thanks for stopping by.
- I got enough on my conscience.

21:09.578 --> 21:10.878
Griggs set us up.

21:10.912 --> 21:12.980
Now Loeb knows we're
after his evidence cache.

21:13.014 --> 21:16.317
Griggs sent you? Guy would turn
on anyone to save his own skin.

21:16.351 --> 21:17.651
You just got to scare him enough.

21:17.686 --> 21:19.386
- We tried.
- Let me.

21:19.421 --> 21:22.756
Counselor, trust me, you're
gonna want to sit this one out.

21:25.794 --> 21:27.228
I want a name!

21:27.262 --> 21:29.897
- Falcone!
- What?!

21:29.931 --> 21:32.133
The only person who knows
where Loeb keeps his stash!

21:32.167 --> 21:34.568
Falcone!

21:34.603 --> 21:36.604
The two of them are in it together!

21:36.638 --> 21:39.740
Loeb and Falcone!

21:40.776 --> 21:43.077
You two are dead men!

21:43.111 --> 21:45.246
You're going against Loeb
and Falcone? You're dead!

21:45.280 --> 21:47.927
Go! Before I lose my good cheer. Go!

21:49.384 --> 21:52.353
He has a point.

21:52.387 --> 21:55.089
Yeah.

21:55.123 --> 21:56.824
So what next?

21:58.860 --> 22:00.995
Assume Loeb and Falcone are the only ones

22:01.029 --> 22:02.963
who know where the stash is.

22:02.998 --> 22:06.227
We need someone close to
them, someone who'll talk.

22:06.803 --> 22:09.103
That person doesn't exist.

22:09.137 --> 22:11.138
Yeah, he does.

22:14.075 --> 22:16.710
Oh, yes. (chuckles)

22:16.745 --> 22:18.846
(door opens)

22:22.551 --> 22:24.785
Gentlemen.

22:24.820 --> 22:27.087
So nice to see you.

22:28.990 --> 22:31.158
What can I do for you?

22:35.722 --> 22:37.823
You do realize what you're asking me to do?

22:38.535 --> 22:40.035
If Don Falcone is working with

22:40.070 --> 22:43.105
Commissioner Loeb to keep
this trove of secrets hidden

22:43.139 --> 22:45.908
and I help you uncover them,

22:45.942 --> 22:47.776
I'd be betraying my patron.

22:47.811 --> 22:50.045
- That's right.
- If he found out, he'd...

22:50.080 --> 22:53.249
well, he'd be very angry.

22:53.283 --> 22:54.416
To say the least.

22:54.451 --> 22:56.252
BULLOCK: Enough with
the hemming and hawing.

22:56.286 --> 22:58.087
Are you gonna help us or not?

23:00.090 --> 23:02.858
Let say, for argument's
sake, I could help you.

23:02.892 --> 23:04.527
What's in it for me?

23:04.561 --> 23:07.730
I'll owe you a favor.

23:07.764 --> 23:09.765
No questions asked?

23:09.799 --> 23:12.101
Jim.

23:12.135 --> 23:13.602
Yes.

23:13.637 --> 23:15.971
Do you know what this is?

23:16.006 --> 23:18.073
Madre Di Dios.

23:18.108 --> 23:20.876
A hundred bottles made once a year

23:20.911 --> 23:22.912
by monks in the Italian countryside.

23:22.946 --> 23:24.713
It's Don Maroni's favorite.

23:24.748 --> 23:26.549
What's your point?

23:26.583 --> 23:28.050
Oh, it's just a piece of information

23:28.084 --> 23:30.886
that might be useful one day.

23:30.921 --> 23:32.621
I like information.

23:34.491 --> 23:37.159
If I help you find where
Loeb keeps his files,

23:37.193 --> 23:40.296
you give me ten minutes alone with them.

23:40.330 --> 23:42.331
I take what I want.

23:43.333 --> 23:47.169
- This is not a good idea.
- Five minutes.

23:47.204 --> 23:50.005
And you don't touch anything
that has to do with cops.

23:50.040 --> 23:54.276
Five minutes with the files
and a favor from Jim Gordon?

23:54.311 --> 23:55.611
Done!

23:55.645 --> 23:58.113
(laughs)

23:58.148 --> 24:00.149
So who's up for a road trip?

24:00.183 --> 24:02.451
We have to give Fish more time.

24:02.485 --> 24:04.620
She'll get us out of here; she promised.

24:04.654 --> 24:06.589
Can't you see she abandoned us?

24:06.623 --> 24:09.425
Got herself out and left us here to rot.

24:09.459 --> 24:12.628
I say we kill this one,
let them know we're serious.

24:12.662 --> 24:15.531
- KELLY: Fish said... 
- MAN: Fish, Fish, Fish.

24:15.565 --> 24:17.800
Where's Fish now?!

24:17.834 --> 24:19.802
Yoo-hoo.

24:22.339 --> 24:24.640
I'm disappointed.

24:24.674 --> 24:26.175
I told you I was coming back.

24:26.209 --> 24:28.711
What, you didn't believe me?

24:28.745 --> 24:32.515
Family is built on trust,
and that's what we are.

24:32.549 --> 24:34.517
A family.

24:34.551 --> 24:38.220
Fish, I tried, I did.

24:38.255 --> 24:40.389
I know you did.

24:42.859 --> 24:45.728
MAN: So where's everything you promised?

24:45.762 --> 24:48.797
- When do we get out?
- First thing's first.

24:48.832 --> 24:50.866
I spoke to the man upstairs

24:50.901 --> 24:54.170
about our demands for better
conditions, better food.

24:54.204 --> 24:57.640
He asked for a show of good faith.

24:57.674 --> 25:00.476
We're gonna return his guard.

25:00.510 --> 25:02.211
(sighs)

25:02.245 --> 25:03.712
Let him go.

25:03.747 --> 25:06.348
Now.

25:19.296 --> 25:20.796
Next...

25:23.400 --> 25:24.800
(woman gasping)

25:24.835 --> 25:27.102
- What?
- (screaming)

25:27.137 --> 25:29.338
- What are they doing?
- I'm sorry, honey.

25:29.372 --> 25:30.739
You're on the list. Doctor's orders.

25:30.774 --> 25:32.575
Fish...

25:32.609 --> 25:33.576
Fish!

25:33.610 --> 25:34.844
MAN: I told you, didn't I?

25:34.878 --> 25:37.213
She's working for them now!

25:37.247 --> 25:38.914
I warned you not everyone would live.

25:38.949 --> 25:42.418
Their sacrifice means your survival!

25:42.452 --> 25:45.554
And my promise remains the same.

26:01.171 --> 26:03.572
You sure about this, Penguin?

26:03.607 --> 26:05.908
You're telling me this is
where Loeb keeps 20 years

26:05.942 --> 26:08.138
of dirty secrets?

26:08.188 --> 26:09.411
Doesn't feel right.

26:09.446 --> 26:12.381
Well, maybe that's the point.
No one would suspect it.

26:12.415 --> 26:14.383
What would you prefer, Detective Bullock?

26:14.417 --> 26:16.085
A sign saying "Super
secret blackmail hoard"?

26:16.119 --> 26:17.653
You know, the last time

26:17.687 --> 26:21.123
the three of us took a
ride, you were in the trunk.

26:21.158 --> 26:22.925
I liked that better.

26:24.233 --> 26:25.633
I told you,

26:25.845 --> 26:27.997
I overheard Falcone on the phone to Loeb.

26:28.031 --> 26:30.399
He said the farm was safe.

26:30.433 --> 26:33.335
Now, I'll wait here, and when you're done,

26:33.370 --> 26:35.337
flash the lights or something.

26:35.372 --> 26:37.573
Uh-uh. You're coming along.

26:37.607 --> 26:40.342
But if whoever's inside sees me
and reports back to Falcone...

26:40.377 --> 26:42.111
Then you'll be in some really deep doo.

26:42.145 --> 26:44.747
What'd you think, huh?

26:44.781 --> 26:46.482
We were gonna go do your dirty work,

26:46.516 --> 26:49.185
and then you were just gonna waltz
in and pick through the leavings?

26:49.219 --> 26:51.821
- Have some respect.
- (gasps)

26:54.224 --> 26:57.560
- You fellas lost?
- Good evening, sir.

26:57.594 --> 27:00.162
We were sent by Commissioner Loeb.

27:00.197 --> 27:03.466
Might we have a word? Out of the cold?

27:03.500 --> 27:06.936
Well, Marge is putting on some tea.

27:06.970 --> 27:08.370
(chuckles)

27:08.405 --> 27:10.406
(gentle music playing)

27:12.442 --> 27:14.176
I love your house.

27:14.211 --> 27:16.045
- It's so cozy.
- Thank you.

27:16.079 --> 27:17.713
How long have you two been here?

27:17.747 --> 27:20.549
Oh, well, about, uh, 20 years.

27:20.584 --> 27:22.551
Ever since Mr. Loeb bought the place.

27:22.586 --> 27:24.954
Hard to believe.

27:24.988 --> 27:27.289
Time, boy.

27:27.324 --> 27:28.891
You should've seen Margie back then.

27:28.925 --> 27:30.393
Hot to trot.

27:30.427 --> 27:33.028
(laughter)

27:33.063 --> 27:34.830
What were you doing before that?

27:34.865 --> 27:37.733
Oh, nothing much. Uh, Margie
was a nurse over at Arkham.

27:37.768 --> 27:40.136
And I working on the rail road.

27:40.170 --> 27:41.337
(imitates train whistle)

27:41.371 --> 27:42.905
(imitates train whistle, laughs)

27:43.774 --> 27:45.674
Why are you men here?

27:46.543 --> 27:49.245
GORDON: Oh, uh, inspection.

27:49.279 --> 27:52.229
Commissioner Loeb has some
concerns about security.

27:52.279 --> 27:54.250
We didn't hear nothing about it.

27:57.788 --> 28:00.589
- You didn't get a letter?
- No.

28:00.624 --> 28:02.525
That's odd.

28:02.559 --> 28:04.727
Y-You should have gotten a letter.

28:04.761 --> 28:06.328
You got I.D.?

28:06.363 --> 28:08.497
JUDE: Well, I don't know
that that's necessary.

28:08.532 --> 28:10.533
No, no. It's fine.

28:10.567 --> 28:12.234
Jim Gordon, GCPD.

28:12.269 --> 28:14.537
This is Detective Bullock.

28:14.571 --> 28:16.505
We're on the commissioner's
personal detail.

28:16.540 --> 28:19.275
He don't look like a cop.

28:19.309 --> 28:21.077
I'm undercover.

28:21.111 --> 28:23.879
(distant thumping)

28:23.914 --> 28:25.776
JUDE: Damn raccoons.

28:27.484 --> 28:30.019
Jim, what do you say we
get on with our inspection?

28:30.053 --> 28:32.855
Mm. Perhaps you wouldn't
mind showing us around.

28:32.889 --> 28:33.989
Oh, absolutely.

28:34.024 --> 28:36.025
Marge, would you mind fetching my keys?

28:36.059 --> 28:37.359
Sure.

28:37.394 --> 28:38.527
Now, listen,

28:38.562 --> 28:41.130
before you go, you fellas
have got to get a piece

28:41.164 --> 28:42.465
of Marge's cake.

28:42.499 --> 28:44.100
She makes it with sour cream.

28:44.134 --> 28:46.544
Tastes like a warm Sunday morning.

28:46.581 --> 28:48.637
(distant thumping)

28:48.672 --> 28:51.040
That's one hell of a big raccoon.

28:51.074 --> 28:52.541
Maybe we should start upstairs.

28:52.576 --> 28:55.444
Oh, just wait a lick for the keys.

28:55.479 --> 28:57.146
Margie-pie, that was quick.

28:57.180 --> 28:58.581
Ma'am, put down the...

29:08.525 --> 29:09.759
(groans)

29:11.094 --> 29:12.762
Freeze!

29:16.933 --> 29:18.901
Thanks, Jim.

29:18.935 --> 29:20.936
- You saved my li... 
- Watch them.

29:25.475 --> 29:27.777
(groaning)

29:27.811 --> 29:31.614
You're lucky I have a
soft spot for old ladies.

29:48.699 --> 29:50.699
(woman softly humming a tune)

30:04.548 --> 30:06.615
Oh.

30:06.650 --> 30:08.718
Uh...

30:08.752 --> 30:11.887
I-It's so quiet downstairs.

30:11.922 --> 30:14.724
Is the party over?

30:14.758 --> 30:16.959
I-I prepared a song.

30:16.993 --> 30:20.496
It includes a dance and everything.

30:20.530 --> 30:22.064
Who the hell are you?

30:22.099 --> 30:25.468
I'm Miriam Loeb.

30:25.502 --> 30:28.070
Did-did my father send you?

30:43.414 --> 30:44.881
Ms. Kringle. (clears throat)

30:44.916 --> 30:46.383
Oh, Mr. Nygma.

30:46.417 --> 30:47.717
Ms. Kringle, I was wondering

30:47.752 --> 30:49.386
if you had dinner plans this evening.

30:49.420 --> 30:52.822
Oh, um... actually, I...

30:52.857 --> 30:55.325
I do. With Tom.

30:55.359 --> 30:56.626
Have-have you met Tom?

30:56.661 --> 30:58.595
You're the guy that likes riddles.

30:58.629 --> 31:02.571
Hey, what has hands but can't clap?

31:03.045 --> 31:04.734
- A clock.
- Correct.

31:04.769 --> 31:06.636
(chuckles) He's good.

31:06.671 --> 31:07.671
You're good.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.608
Am I correct to assume that this is your...

31:11.642 --> 31:14.110
uh, your new boyfriend?

31:14.145 --> 31:15.979
Yeah... Yes, I guess so.

31:16.013 --> 31:16.947
You betcha. (slap)

31:16.981 --> 31:18.648
Oh.

31:18.683 --> 31:21.151
Congratulations, sir.

31:21.185 --> 31:22.852
Thank you.

31:22.887 --> 31:24.854
Well, we should probably

31:24.889 --> 31:26.256
- get going.
- Okay.

31:26.290 --> 31:27.958
It's nice to meet you.

31:27.992 --> 31:30.894
Riddle man, next time...

31:30.928 --> 31:32.529
I'm gonna stump you.

31:32.563 --> 31:36.032
Yes. Next time.

31:52.750 --> 31:54.351
(laughs)

31:54.385 --> 31:57.454
So, Miriam, you live up here all the time?

31:57.488 --> 31:58.455
Always.

31:58.489 --> 32:01.892
Uh, ever since...

32:01.926 --> 32:05.395
I, uh... I'm not alone though.

32:05.429 --> 32:08.832
Father comes to visit on Sundays.

32:08.866 --> 32:12.791
And we listen to the
radio and play checkers.

32:12.953 --> 32:14.905
He always lets me win.

32:14.939 --> 32:18.174
My dad used to do the same thing.

32:18.209 --> 32:19.876
Oh. Really?

32:21.279 --> 32:23.246
Fathers are funny like that, aren't they?

32:23.281 --> 32:24.748
Yeah, your dad's a real hoot.

32:24.782 --> 32:27.851
Does he keep other stuff up here?

32:27.885 --> 32:29.452
Like important papers or files

32:29.487 --> 32:32.489
or maybe rooms full of boxes?

32:32.523 --> 32:34.224
No.

32:34.258 --> 32:36.092
Why would he do that?

32:37.795 --> 32:39.696
(whispers): This is a waste of time.

32:42.800 --> 32:44.801
Miriam...

32:49.240 --> 32:51.708
what happened to your mother?

32:51.742 --> 32:54.311
She...

32:54.345 --> 32:56.179
died.

32:56.214 --> 32:58.181
I, um...

32:58.216 --> 33:00.668
I've started a new hobby.

33:00.756 --> 33:03.520
- Would you like to see?
- Sure.

33:03.554 --> 33:05.555
Oh, great.

33:07.625 --> 33:09.593
(quietly): What are you doing?

33:09.627 --> 33:11.928
Loeb's wife died 20 years ago.

33:11.963 --> 33:15.799
Skull fracture from a fall down the stairs.

33:15.833 --> 33:17.734
Miriam would've been a teenager.

33:17.768 --> 33:20.136
So you think Loeb killed her?
She was the witness?

33:20.171 --> 33:21.905
That's why he keeps her cooped up here?

33:21.939 --> 33:24.908
You said I wasn't the
only one with a Cobblepot.

33:24.942 --> 33:26.743
Maybe this is his.

33:26.777 --> 33:29.773
MIRIAM: I started making jewelry.

33:35.620 --> 33:38.822
What's it made of?

33:38.856 --> 33:41.825
Bones.

33:41.859 --> 33:44.327
Starlings.

33:44.362 --> 33:46.329
They, uh...

33:46.364 --> 33:48.832
they land on my windowsill,

33:48.866 --> 33:52.602
and... you can catch them

33:52.637 --> 33:56.506
if you're really silent and still.

33:56.541 --> 34:01.211
(whispering): And I can
be really silent and still.

34:02.947 --> 34:06.116
Silent as a mouse.

34:07.151 --> 34:09.853
Then what do you do?

34:09.887 --> 34:12.688
I...

34:12.723 --> 34:16.293
crush the back of their heads.

34:16.998 --> 34:18.995
- I just press down with my thumb.
- (bones crack)

34:20.998 --> 34:23.033
It makes, like, a...

34:23.067 --> 34:24.801
- a popping noise.
- (bones crack)

34:26.536 --> 34:28.138
- Pop.
- (bones crack)

34:34.978 --> 34:37.347
Miriam...

34:40.184 --> 34:43.053
can you tell us about your mother's death?

34:46.556 --> 34:49.893
I'm a good person.

34:49.927 --> 34:51.795
(sniffles)

34:51.829 --> 34:54.498
Sometimes good people make mistakes.

34:54.532 --> 34:58.134
That's what Father said.

34:58.169 --> 35:01.538
Did you make a mistake with your mother?

35:01.572 --> 35:04.508
Was it like what happens with the birds?

35:04.542 --> 35:07.878
No.

35:07.912 --> 35:10.347
Not like with the birds.

35:10.381 --> 35:12.349
Silly.

35:12.383 --> 35:14.217
(sniffles)

35:14.252 --> 35:17.187
I had to use a candlestick on her.

35:19.190 --> 35:23.126
She wouldn't stop singing either.

35:23.161 --> 35:26.730
She knew that it was my night.

35:26.764 --> 35:30.200
I was supposed to perform at dinner.

35:30.234 --> 35:32.068
Not her.

35:32.103 --> 35:34.337
So you hit her and she stopped.

35:34.372 --> 35:36.840
And your dad covered it up.

35:36.874 --> 35:40.777
MIRIAM: He knew that it was my night.

35:40.811 --> 35:42.779
(gunshot in distance)

35:53.391 --> 35:56.059
I'm sorry, Jim. They-they
came at me. I tried...

35:56.093 --> 35:58.428
(engine starts outside)

36:01.063 --> 36:03.200
OSWALD: <i> Did you find</i>
<i>what Loeb's hiding?</i>

36:03.234 --> 36:04.868
Is it here?

36:04.902 --> 36:06.303
Yes.

36:06.337 --> 36:08.305
Well, a deal's a deal.

36:08.339 --> 36:10.707
You have to let me in there.

36:10.741 --> 36:12.442
Who's he?

36:12.477 --> 36:14.778
He looks just like a bird.

36:17.114 --> 36:19.716
Oh, I love birds.

36:19.750 --> 36:22.085
(exhales)

36:32.841 --> 36:35.476
I see you still haven't
learned the art of knocking,

36:35.510 --> 36:37.511
Detective Gordon.

36:50.892 --> 36:53.294
Miriam is sick.

36:56.665 --> 36:58.633
She didn't mean to hurt her mother.

36:58.667 --> 37:00.868
She just...

37:00.903 --> 37:03.871
has these urges.

37:03.906 --> 37:06.207
If you want to expose
what she did, go ahead.

37:06.241 --> 37:07.942
You think I can't weather the scandal?

37:07.976 --> 37:09.944
I'm sure you could.

37:10.953 --> 37:13.390
But that's not why you kept
her locked away for 20 years.

37:13.427 --> 37:15.116
Do enlighten me.

37:16.151 --> 37:18.452
I think you love her.

37:18.487 --> 37:20.955
I think you've done everything you can

37:20.989 --> 37:24.458
to keep her out of Arkham.

37:24.493 --> 37:26.961
And you'll keep doing it.

37:26.995 --> 37:29.197
You're willing to hold my daughter hostage

37:29.231 --> 37:30.598
to achieve your ends?

37:30.632 --> 37:33.034
You're much colder than I thought.

37:33.068 --> 37:36.237
So it seems.

37:36.271 --> 37:38.973
I'll hand in my resignation today.

37:39.007 --> 37:40.608
Just keep Miriam out of it.

37:40.642 --> 37:42.777
No, you're not resigning.

37:42.811 --> 37:46.180
You step down, I'll have
someone else to deal with.

37:46.215 --> 37:50.051
And chances are he'll be
Falcone's lapdog, same as you.

37:50.085 --> 37:52.653
With you...

37:52.688 --> 37:54.689
I have leverage.

37:57.693 --> 37:59.560
So what do you want?

37:59.595 --> 38:02.230
Flass is tried.

38:02.264 --> 38:04.098
Fairly.

38:04.132 --> 38:06.467
And I want all the
evidence you have on Bullock

38:06.502 --> 38:10.771
and every other cop in the
GCPD sent to Harvey Dent.

38:10.806 --> 38:14.642
- He'll decide who to prosecute.
- No.

38:14.676 --> 38:18.946
I do that, I'm a dead man.

38:18.981 --> 38:22.250
I love Miriam, but I love living, too.

38:24.253 --> 38:27.121
You can have Bullock's file.

38:27.156 --> 38:29.157
But not the rest.

38:34.196 --> 38:36.164
Fine.

38:36.198 --> 38:39.667
And Miriam stays where she is.

38:39.701 --> 38:42.670
Is that all?

38:42.704 --> 38:46.541
There's one more thing.

38:46.575 --> 38:49.710
It's become something of
a habit to stand up here

38:49.745 --> 38:52.380
with Detective Gordon, but
with the coming election

38:52.414 --> 38:56.017
for president of the policemen's union,

38:56.051 --> 38:58.986
there's no man I'd rather support.

39:03.992 --> 39:07.528
Thank you, Commissioner Loeb.

39:07.563 --> 39:11.065
It's a new day in the GCPD.

39:20.409 --> 39:22.810
Sorry I missed your big moment.

39:22.845 --> 39:26.047
I figured I'd catch the next one.

39:26.081 --> 39:27.515
Your file.

39:31.887 --> 39:35.556
It's everything Loeb has on you.

39:35.591 --> 39:37.558
Always hated that picture.

39:44.549 --> 39:46.161
You know, you tell yourself...

39:47.736 --> 39:50.023
"I'll just do this one bad thing,

39:51.023 --> 39:53.861
but all the good things I'll
do later will make up for it."

39:55.511 --> 39:58.746
But they don't.

39:58.781 --> 40:01.616
There's still that bad thing.

40:03.619 --> 40:07.021
Penguin's gonna come asking for that favor.

40:07.056 --> 40:10.258
Be careful.

40:19.601 --> 40:21.969
I know we had a deal.

40:22.004 --> 40:25.473
I let you go, and you escape
the inevitable punishment

40:25.507 --> 40:26.974
that will descend on your heads

40:27.009 --> 40:29.440
when Commissioner Loeb
hears of your failure.

40:30.190 --> 40:32.246
Unfortunately, I was only able

40:32.281 --> 40:36.050
to acquire one ticket to Arizona.

40:37.194 --> 40:38.781
So who's it gonna be?

40:40.789 --> 40:43.658
Margie and I have been
together for 20 years.

40:43.692 --> 40:45.293
We're not splitting up.

40:46.996 --> 40:49.163
Life can be cruel sometimes.

40:51.200 --> 40:53.801
How do we decide who goes?

40:55.838 --> 40:58.339
I leave that in your hands.

41:00.376 --> 41:02.343
Wait a minute!

41:02.378 --> 41:04.812
(stammers) Margie! Margie!

41:05.948 --> 41:07.482
(laughs)

41:09.184 --> 41:10.485
(crashing)

41:10.519 --> 41:12.353
(chuckles) Whoa.

41:15.891 --> 41:19.327
(grunting)

41:20.362 --> 41:22.130
MARGE: Here we go.

41:22.164 --> 41:23.197
Here we go!

41:23.232 --> 41:24.799
(grunting)

41:33.676 --> 41:35.243
(panting)

41:35.277 --> 41:37.111
What time is the train?

41:37.146 --> 41:39.714
Oh, there's no train.

41:39.748 --> 41:41.950
- I just needed your help.
- What?

41:41.984 --> 41:44.886
I was down to one shell.

41:47.923 --> 41:50.959
I've been thinking of
introducing salsa night.

41:50.993 --> 41:54.262
Do you think our guests would like that?

41:56.298 --> 41:57.865
No.

41:57.900 --> 42:00.868
Honest. Good.

42:00.903 --> 42:03.304
But... I like salsa.

42:03.339 --> 42:06.307
Tuesday it is.

42:06.342 --> 42:09.811
So... you've completed your task,

42:09.845 --> 42:13.748
and the lines of supply
are open once again.

42:13.782 --> 42:16.351
I am duly impressed.

42:17.353 --> 42:20.321
Hope is a carrot easily dangled

42:20.356 --> 42:22.257
in front of the desperate, Doctor.

42:23.292 --> 42:28.229
And you have earned your carrot.

42:28.264 --> 42:31.266
Welcome to upper management.

42:31.300 --> 42:34.435
I think you'll find the view
better than in the basement.

42:34.470 --> 42:36.437
In fact...

42:38.707 --> 42:41.709
You see why I can trust you.

42:41.744 --> 42:45.747
Why I'm not worried about
you betraying me and escaping.

42:48.117 --> 42:51.452
Yes. I see.
