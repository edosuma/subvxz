00:40.466 --> 00:44.300
(serene music playing)

01:02.933 --> 01:05.933
Good morning. Oh, you've already
got breakfast ready.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.966
Becky and I were up
till all hours talking.

01:09.033 --> 01:13.300
We haven't had a talk
like that since... ever.

01:13.366 --> 01:14.633
Must have been fun.

01:14.700 --> 01:18.166
Oh, yeah. We did each other's hair
and laughed.

01:18.233 --> 01:19.766
I can see why.

01:24.033 --> 01:25.800
Why are you here?

01:25.866 --> 01:29.133
You were supposed to have
your checkup with Dr. Segal.

01:29.200 --> 01:31.800
You didn't hear about Dr. Segal?

01:31.866 --> 01:32.733
Hear what?

01:32.800 --> 01:35.033
I'm not going.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.733
Ma, you are impossible.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.100
Now, this is the third
appointment you've missed.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.666
At my age,
checkups can be dangerous.

01:41.733 --> 01:44.133
You know Sam, who thinks
he's hiding his stomach

01:44.200 --> 01:46.700
by wearing Hawaiian shirts?

01:46.766 --> 01:48.700
Yeah. Sam is fine.

01:48.766 --> 01:51.133
His brother had a checkup.

01:51.200 --> 01:54.700
The doctor said he was great.
Three days later, he died.

01:54.766 --> 01:59.700
He owed money to a guy named "Face"
and got thrown off a pier.

02:00.866 --> 02:04.033
That was one of the causes.
I'm not going.

02:04.100 --> 02:04.900
You're going.

02:04.966 --> 02:08.600
Rose, could you give me a hand?

02:08.666 --> 02:11.300
Becky and I are having breakfast
on the lanai.

02:11.366 --> 02:14.500
We're still bonding.

02:14.566 --> 02:16.566
Dorothy, how come we never bond?

02:16.633 --> 02:19.333
We're from before
bonding and quality time.

02:22.033 --> 02:23.633
We're from when people
stayed together

02:23.700 --> 02:26.733
because they had no choice.

02:26.800 --> 02:30.133
Ma, would I be insisting
on this checkup

02:30.200 --> 02:31.833
if I didn't care about you?

02:31.900 --> 02:35.533
Let's do each other's hair
like Blanche and her daughter.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.533
I know you're scared.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.333
I'll go with you.

02:39.400 --> 02:42.966
When I was little, didn't you
make me get all my shots?

02:43.033 --> 02:45.533
I said we were going
on pony rides,

02:45.600 --> 02:50.466
and you fell for it time after time,
just like Pavlov's dog...

02:51.700 --> 02:53.500
only dumber.

02:55.066 --> 02:56.933
Okay, Ma.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.566
If you don't want to go to
the doctor, you don't have to go.

03:00.633 --> 03:03.666
Why don't we spend tomorrow
afternoon together?

03:03.733 --> 03:06.000
We'll work on our bonding.

03:06.066 --> 03:08.533
We'll go to Wolfie's
for an egg cream.

03:08.600 --> 03:09.633
Chocolate?

03:09.700 --> 03:10.766
You betcha.

03:10.833 --> 03:13.700
Oh, boy, a chocolate egg cream.

03:16.066 --> 03:17.666
Forget it, Dorothy.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.800
I smell a pony ride.

03:26.566 --> 03:29.200
I think this is the best visit
we've ever had.

03:29.266 --> 03:32.466
It's because you've realized
I'm a grown woman.

03:32.533 --> 03:33.966
Well, I never thought
the day would come,

03:34.033 --> 03:36.600
but we are finally the same age.

03:40.166 --> 03:42.766
Why don't you stay longer?

03:42.833 --> 03:45.900
Oh, Mama, I can't stay, because...

03:47.233 --> 03:49.366
we're telling each other
everything, right?

03:49.466 --> 03:51.333
Everything. No more secrets.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.366
Oh, good.

03:53.433 --> 03:54.766
Mama...

03:54.833 --> 03:58.033
I'm getting impregnated on Monday.

04:02.133 --> 04:08.466
I've decided to go to a sperm bank
and get artificially inseminated.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.533
Why would you do something
like this? Just to hurt me?

04:16.266 --> 04:18.300
Mama, try to understand.

04:18.366 --> 04:21.266
I can't pass a carriage
without looking in.

04:21.333 --> 04:23.766
My biological clock's
ticking so loudly,

04:23.833 --> 04:25.966
it's keeping me up at night.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.000
A baby should do that.

04:28.066 --> 04:30.533
Wait until you get married.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.233
I don't want marriage.

04:32.300 --> 04:34.133
Well, then at least
wait until I'm dead.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.366
You really mean that?

04:40.433 --> 04:43.566
Yes, I do, and wait
until all my friends are dead too.

04:46.666 --> 04:50.533
The last thing I need is whispering
at my funeral.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.666
I can't believe
you're reacting like this.

04:53.733 --> 04:57.500
We got so close,
I thought I could tell you anything.

04:57.566 --> 05:00.166
Anything but this.

05:00.233 --> 05:03.133
Mama, I'm doing this
whether you like it or not.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.766
Oh. Oh, I see, missy.

05:05.833 --> 05:10.633
This is the thanks I get
for all those nights you cried?

05:10.700 --> 05:12.233
I'd have to get up

05:12.300 --> 05:15.800
and grope around
for my slippers and robe,

05:15.866 --> 05:18.866
make my way
all the way downstairs,

05:18.933 --> 05:21.066
and scream for the governess.

05:27.566 --> 05:30.033
(mellow music playing)

05:39.700 --> 05:41.433
Hungry or suicidal?

05:43.433 --> 05:48.533
It's not easy being the mother
of a child with her own free will.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.833
I knew I felt the refrigerator open.

05:53.700 --> 05:56.333
What's wrong?
You've been upset all day.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.133
It's Rebecca.
I just don't understand.

06:00.466 --> 06:04.333
Why didn't somebody
tell me it was dinnertime?

06:04.400 --> 06:08.000
Ma, it's not dinner.
It's the middle of the night.

06:08.066 --> 06:10.800
Good. Then I'm dressed for it.

06:10.866 --> 06:12.566
Blanche is upset.

06:12.633 --> 06:16.566
You'd be too, if your daughter...
I can't say it.

06:16.633 --> 06:20.733
What happened? The two
of you were getting so close.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.500
Becky's going to have a baby
by artificial insemination.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.400
I can't think about it.

06:37.966 --> 06:40.033
I'm being silly, aren't I?

06:44.833 --> 06:47.433
For god's sake,
somebody say something.

06:47.500 --> 06:48.900
Oooh.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.000
Big help.

06:54.066 --> 06:55.066
Dorothy, what about you?

06:55.133 --> 06:59.833
You're always the sensible one,
the free modern thinker.

06:59.900 --> 07:01.066
Now, what do you think?

07:02.366 --> 07:04.066
Oooh.

07:05.666 --> 07:07.600
No wonder I'm up
in the middle of the night

07:07.666 --> 07:09.700
working my way through the cheese keeper.

07:09.766 --> 07:12.966
Thank God I don't have the thighs
of a normal woman.

07:14.366 --> 07:15.833
I tried to talk her out of it.

07:15.900 --> 07:17.400
She says she has
thought it through.

07:17.466 --> 07:19.500
There's no changing her mind.

07:19.566 --> 07:22.066
It might not be so bad.

07:22.133 --> 07:27.866
Last week, I was reading you can buy
the sperm of Nobel prize winners.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.033
Or was it <i>Star Search</i> winners?

07:37.733 --> 07:41.433
Buy? Well, sperm used to be free.
It was all over the place.

07:47.433 --> 07:51.533
On the farm a lot of the animals
got artificially inseminated.

07:51.600 --> 07:55.900
Once Harry the bull went through
a whole spring unaroused

07:55.966 --> 08:00.000
and the cows and my father
were out of their minds with grief.

08:00.066 --> 08:04.600
I mean, you haven't seen anything
till you've seen a frustrated cow.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.733
They can get this crazed look in their eye

08:08.800 --> 08:11.566
and you know they're thinking,
"Where's mine?"

08:14.933 --> 08:16.666
"Where's mine?"

08:19.166 --> 08:21.233
Cows have feelings too.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.366
Anyway, when Harry really got lazy,

08:24.433 --> 08:28.266
Dad had to bring in Mr. Hoffenheisen
to spread the seed.

08:29.200 --> 08:32.133
He did it in the most unusual way.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.600
He'd put on
this really long rubber glove...

08:41.766 --> 08:45.300
Rose, that's a terrific story,
and surprisingly on subject,

08:45.366 --> 08:51.000
but I don't think that Blanche wants
to hear about uncontented cows right now.

08:51.166 --> 08:54.600
It's not that I mind becoming
a young grandmother again,

08:54.666 --> 08:56.100
nobody believes it anyway.

08:56.166 --> 08:58.566
Please...

08:58.633 --> 09:01.366
It's just that
it seems so unnatural,

09:01.433 --> 09:05.266
no daddy for the baby
and no fun trying.

09:07.066 --> 09:09.333
I have to agree
with Blanche on this.

09:09.400 --> 09:12.800
Half the fun is in getting there.

09:12.866 --> 09:17.766
Boy, did your father
and I have fun trying for you.

09:17.833 --> 09:19.733
I don't want to hear this.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.433
I was waiting until you're 60,
but I think you can handle it now.

09:25.466 --> 09:26.833
We lived in New York.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.266
There was the St. Gennaro
festival every year.

09:29.333 --> 09:34.033
Your father,
rest in peace until I get there,

09:34.100 --> 09:36.866
got so turned on
by the festivities once,

09:36.933 --> 09:38.733
he couldn't wait till we got home.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.966
So he took me, right there,
behind the sausage and pepper stand.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.533
We were behind garbage cans.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.833
It's not like we were
in front of everybody.

09:58.233 --> 10:01.266
I can relate to the festivities
part, Sophia.

10:01.333 --> 10:06.433
All our children were conceived
on special St. Olaf holidays.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.233
Adam was conceived the day
of the Princess Pig

10:09.300 --> 10:14.166
when they had the pig crowning, and
Ginella was conceived on Hay day.

10:14.233 --> 10:18.666
That's the day we
St. Olafians celebrate hay.

10:19.166 --> 10:23.766
Do you think you could wrap this up
before Rebecca goes into labor?

10:23.833 --> 10:25.600
Then there was
the day of the wheat

10:25.666 --> 10:29.033
when everybody came
dressed as sandwiches.

10:31.133 --> 10:33.633
Charlie and I forgot
to put cheese between us,

10:33.700 --> 10:36.566
and before I knew it,
there was Kirsten.

10:42.033 --> 10:46.600
What Rebecca is doing
is really not so terrible.

10:46.666 --> 10:48.300
Look, among the four of us,

10:48.366 --> 10:51.800
each of us conceived
our children in a different way.

10:51.866 --> 10:54.633
I was totally unconscious.

10:55.133 --> 10:59.900
When I came to, there was Stan
carving a notch in his dashboard.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.466
I never bought
that unconscious story.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.666
He must've slipped me something.

11:08.733 --> 11:10.033
Apparently.

11:17.766 --> 11:20.766
At least what
we all did was natural.

11:20.833 --> 11:22.566
Well, not all the time.

11:24.766 --> 11:27.000
There's some other stuff...

11:27.066 --> 11:29.633
I shouldn't tell till you're 70.

11:31.700 --> 11:36.866
(soft music playing)

11:39.366 --> 11:40.433
Hi.

11:40.500 --> 11:41.766
Oh, hi, Becky.

11:41.833 --> 11:43.166
Have you seen mother?

11:43.233 --> 11:46.266
She has a headache.
She's in her room.

11:46.333 --> 11:47.400
Hanging herself.

11:50.533 --> 11:51.733
Oh, hi, everybody.

11:51.800 --> 11:54.033
-How are you feeling?
-Much better.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.633
How about going out to dinner?

11:56.700 --> 11:58.233
Mama, can we talk?

11:58.300 --> 12:00.500
Where would you like to eat?

12:00.566 --> 12:04.066
I want you to be
part of the process.

12:04.133 --> 12:08.633
I think you're headed for trouble
going off by yourself like this.

12:08.700 --> 12:11.833
No man will marry you with a baby.

12:11.900 --> 12:15.666
There are lots of people
who are single parents,

12:15.733 --> 12:17.100
and they're doing just fine.

12:17.166 --> 12:18.500
Yeah. Look at me.

12:24.866 --> 12:27.133
The right man could be
around the corner.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.733
Maybe not.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.733
I may not find anyone
around the corner.

12:31.800 --> 12:34.400
So, instead of trying,
you're giving up

12:34.466 --> 12:36.566
and doing this crazy baby thing.

12:36.633 --> 12:38.400
Crazy baby thing?

12:38.466 --> 12:43.366
I'm taking control of my life
and having the family I need.

12:43.433 --> 12:48.100
I'd never have a baby artificially,
and I don't approve of it.

12:48.166 --> 12:52.100
If that's what you want,
you'll lose me and your grandchild.

12:53.766 --> 12:58.700
(sad music playing)

12:59.166 --> 13:03.300
(serene music playing)

13:03.733 --> 13:07.700
Ah, there you are. Ma, I scheduled
the appointment for your checkup.

13:10.200 --> 13:12.766
Ma, you know you have to have a physical.

13:13.666 --> 13:17.066
What do you want me to do, take you
to court, have you declared incompetent?

13:17.133 --> 13:21.533
I'm not incompetent. Once when I laughed
too hard, I had a little accident.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.100
Can I fix you some breakfast, honey?

13:31.166 --> 13:32.566
No, thanks.

13:32.633 --> 13:34.833
Oh, I just feel terrible.

13:34.900 --> 13:37.000
If I'm gonna spend the night
tossing and turning,

13:37.066 --> 13:40.633
at least I wanna wake up
smelling like aftershave.

13:46.466 --> 13:48.166
Morning.

13:48.233 --> 13:50.400
Good morning, Rebecca.

13:50.466 --> 13:52.866
I got up early
and did some research.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.166
There's a sperm bank
not far from here.

13:55.233 --> 13:56.600
How convenient.

13:59.566 --> 14:02.833
No kidding. Do they have
a drive-up window?

14:07.066 --> 14:09.233
I thought we could go there,

14:09.300 --> 14:11.466
and once you see these places
are legitimate,

14:11.533 --> 14:13.233
you won't be so upset.

14:13.300 --> 14:16.133
I don't want to go.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.300
It's embarrassing.

14:17.366 --> 14:20.633
What if a neighbor saw me?
What would they think?

14:20.700 --> 14:24.500
That you're picking something up
for a much younger person.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.566
Mama, please?

14:28.633 --> 14:30.566
It's really important to me.

14:32.433 --> 14:37.200
Blanche, would it help
if I were to go with you?

14:37.266 --> 14:38.566
-Well--
-I'll come too.

14:38.633 --> 14:39.933
I'll bring my camera.

14:44.366 --> 14:47.133
It's never too soon
to start a baby book.

14:48.900 --> 14:52.100
Oh, boy.
We're going to a sperm bank!

14:56.300 --> 15:00.700
I can't think of a better way
to pep up a slow day.

15:00.766 --> 15:02.733
Ma, you're not going.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.600
Why not?

15:03.666 --> 15:06.200
You shouldn't be doing
anything strenuous

15:06.266 --> 15:10.266
like going to a sperm bank
until you've had that checkup.

15:10.333 --> 15:14.366
All right, I'll go. But this better
be a great sperm bank.

15:17.300 --> 15:19.033
So, I guess we're going?

15:19.100 --> 15:21.000
Oh, I guess.

15:21.066 --> 15:24.566
What does one wear
to a sperm bank?

15:24.633 --> 15:26.866
Something attractive in rubber.

15:37.933 --> 15:39.600
I have that.

15:41.933 --> 15:46.400
(mellow music playing)

15:53.500 --> 15:56.500
Did you see how they looked at us
when you pushed five?

15:56.566 --> 15:58.300
I'm so embarrassed.

15:58.366 --> 16:00.566
They didn't look at us.

16:00.633 --> 16:02.333
They didn't want
to make eye contact

16:02.400 --> 16:06.066
with anybody going to
the fifth floor, the sperm floor.

16:08.466 --> 16:10.400
I think you're overreacting.

16:10.466 --> 16:14.266
Perverts looked at us
like we were perverts.

16:14.333 --> 16:15.666
I know that look.

16:18.333 --> 16:22.166
I thought it would be
more bank-like.

16:22.233 --> 16:23.500
What did you expect?

16:23.566 --> 16:26.033
They don't have a Christmas club.

16:28.700 --> 16:30.566
Hi, I'm Rebecca Devereaux.

16:30.633 --> 16:32.366
We have an appointment
with Dr. Manning.

16:32.433 --> 16:37.033
He'll be with you shortly.
I'll call you when he's ready.

16:41.466 --> 16:43.566
I'm not here for me.
It's for a friend.

16:47.066 --> 16:49.166
How was your doctor's
appointment, Sophia?

16:49.233 --> 16:52.100
I have the body of a 40-year-old.

16:52.166 --> 16:55.100
A dead 40-year-old.

16:55.166 --> 16:56.666
The doctor's going
to be a while.

16:56.733 --> 16:58.600
I guess we should sit down.

16:58.666 --> 17:02.500
I suppose it's safe.

17:02.566 --> 17:03.733
Mama!

17:03.800 --> 17:05.100
You're acting silly.

17:05.166 --> 17:08.000
Sperm can't live outside
the human body.

17:08.866 --> 17:11.600
Does your mother know
you're doing this for a living?

17:14.900 --> 17:20.000
You know, I'm not so sure
sperm can't live outside the body.

17:20.066 --> 17:24.066
Back during World War II, my
best friend Claire Osterhus' husband

17:24.133 --> 17:27.300
was in the army
and stationed in France.

17:27.366 --> 17:31.700
Well, five month is after
he left St. Olaf, she got pregnant.

17:36.166 --> 17:38.133
People thought
she was fooling around,

17:38.200 --> 17:41.300
but she told me
that sperm must have swum

17:41.366 --> 17:46.266
from Normandy, across the Atlantic,
up the St. Lawrence seaway,

17:46.333 --> 17:48.766
into the great lakes,
and then over to Minnesota.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.433
And what did you think, Rose?

17:56.033 --> 17:59.566
Well, I know those little guys are
supposed to be good swimmers...

18:00.966 --> 18:03.766
but I think it had to come
over by mail.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.400
I bet this is more fun
than giving blood.

18:17.300 --> 18:20.566
I've waited long enough.
That doctor has wasted my time.

18:20.633 --> 18:24.533
The doctor will see you now.
End of the hall.

18:24.600 --> 18:28.200
-Come on, Mama.
-Eyes straight, ladies.

18:28.266 --> 18:29.966
Ma, no opening doors.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.833
(doctor) And that's pretty much
the procedure.

18:33.900 --> 18:36.000
Rebecca will be cared for
by her own doctor

18:36.066 --> 18:37.866
after selecting a donor

18:37.933 --> 18:41.233
from thousands
of acceptable possibilities.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.433
Any questions?

18:42.500 --> 18:44.200
Plenty.

18:44.266 --> 18:46.266
Can just anybody
walk in off the street

18:46.333 --> 18:48.300
and make my daughter pregnant?

18:48.366 --> 18:50.400
We screen the applicants.

18:50.466 --> 18:51.700
We know everything about them.

18:51.766 --> 18:55.300
We know their body type,
IQ, eye color...

18:55.366 --> 18:56.666
any more questions?

18:56.733 --> 18:58.633
Yes, just one.

18:59.633 --> 19:01.200
What in hell are we doing here?

19:01.266 --> 19:03.700
I feel I'm in the middle
of some awful dream.

19:03.766 --> 19:06.566
Yet I know it can't be.
There are no boy dancers.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.133
Mother.

19:10.200 --> 19:12.833
I cannot believe you are going
to give money

19:12.900 --> 19:16.233
to someone like this...
sperm pusher.

19:17.766 --> 19:19.233
You are a Devereaux.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.000
A Devereaux's never
had to pay for it.

19:21.066 --> 19:23.033
I haven't.

19:23.133 --> 19:26.333
She's always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

19:33.866 --> 19:36.266
Fine, fine. Make jokes.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.366
You wouldn't feel too great

19:38.433 --> 19:41.400
having a test tube
for a son-in-law.

19:43.133 --> 19:44.200
Sorry, doctor.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.366
I thought mother was
open enough to understand.

19:46.433 --> 19:47.900
Thanks for your time.

19:47.966 --> 19:49.133
(doctor) Ladies.

19:53.300 --> 19:54.700
Just out of curiosity,

19:54.766 --> 19:57.800
you don't have any Tony Bennett
socked away, do you?

20:10.133 --> 20:13.200
Blanche, your daughter's
about to leave for the airport.

20:13.266 --> 20:15.000
What are you doing?

20:15.066 --> 20:16.466
There's still some sun.

20:16.533 --> 20:18.266
I'm getting a little color.

20:18.333 --> 20:21.466
This is the dumbest thing
you could do.

20:21.533 --> 20:22.900
Dorothy's right.

20:22.966 --> 20:24.600
The sun's rays are dangerous.

20:24.666 --> 20:27.166
There's a hole in the ozone.

20:29.900 --> 20:31.733
If you're here to get me

20:31.800 --> 20:34.400
to patch things up
with Rebecca, forget it.

20:34.466 --> 20:38.733
You have to let your daughter
make her own decisions.

20:38.800 --> 20:42.900
I remember when you were deciding
what you wanted to be.

20:42.966 --> 20:46.600
I wanted to go to college
and be a schoolteacher.

20:46.666 --> 20:50.033
Pop wanted me to be a cosmetician
in a funeral parlor.

20:51.966 --> 20:54.300
He always liked
looking at dead people.

20:54.366 --> 20:57.166
Dead people and the dodgers.

20:57.233 --> 21:00.033
That was it for his
good-time department.

21:00.633 --> 21:02.700
Sometimes just to make him happy

21:02.766 --> 21:06.400
I'd lie in bed
with a baseball hat on.

21:06.466 --> 21:10.333
The point is, she let me
make my own choices.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.600
This argument
you're having with Rebecca

21:12.666 --> 21:15.433
isn't about artificial insemination.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.633
Like hell it isn't.

21:16.700 --> 21:21.066
Part of it is, but the
bigger part is about control.

21:21.133 --> 21:23.900
You refuse to see your daughter
as an adult

21:23.966 --> 21:26.000
with the right to make decisions.

21:26.066 --> 21:28.533
You have to let go.

21:28.600 --> 21:31.833
The more you try to make her
see things your way,

21:31.900 --> 21:33.466
the more she'll resist,

21:33.533 --> 21:36.033
then you'll run the risk
of never seeing her again...

21:36.833 --> 21:39.066
and never seeing
your grandchild.

21:39.133 --> 21:40.166
Never.

21:41.766 --> 21:43.533
Think about it, Blanche.

21:44.733 --> 21:47.166
Oh, damn,
I don't want that to happen.

21:47.666 --> 21:51.600
Then I suggest you apologize.

21:51.666 --> 21:54.166
I know Rebecca
is a grown woman, but...

21:54.233 --> 21:56.566
to me she's still little.

21:56.633 --> 21:59.400
How do you say
I'm sorry to your child

21:59.466 --> 22:02.266
after years of sending them
to their room

22:02.333 --> 22:05.366
until they were ready
to apologize to you?

22:05.433 --> 22:10.233
Now everything's all topsy-turvy.
I don't know if I can do it.

22:10.300 --> 22:13.666
Maybe I should send you
to your room.

22:15.066 --> 22:16.166
Rebecca...

22:21.200 --> 22:25.666
Honey... oh. I'm...

22:27.300 --> 22:28.366
I'm...

22:33.833 --> 22:36.366
-I'm--
-Blanche, say it! I'm sorry!

22:36.433 --> 22:40.066
There!
What she just said.

22:40.133 --> 22:41.900
There. I knew
you could do it.

22:41.966 --> 22:45.500
I've just been so dumb
about this whole thing.

22:45.566 --> 22:47.700
Should've respected
what you wanted to do.

22:47.766 --> 22:48.766
Really?

22:48.833 --> 22:51.966
Yes.
Let me drive you to the airport.

22:52.033 --> 22:55.133
We'll think up baby names
on the way.

22:55.200 --> 22:58.133
Great. I'll go get rid of the cab.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.866
Oh!

22:59.933 --> 23:03.233
-Blanche, you did the right thing.
-Thank you.

23:03.300 --> 23:04.933
You girls were right.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.333
If my daughter
wants to get herself

23:08.400 --> 23:12.266
artificially inseminated,
I guess that's not so bad.

23:14.533 --> 23:15.966
Ooh!

23:24.566 --> 23:27.633
(theme music playing)
