01:10.438 --> 01:12.571
Yes. Well, karthik
has many other strengths,

01:12.573 --> 01:14.473
Like putting
up with your mom.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.041

Eh, you wanted a good time
and no strippers,

01:27.588 --> 01:30.422
So the answer was
easy-- trampoline park.

Man on phone:
Oh, the photographer is here.

Pretty standard stuff, but I'm
most excited about the joke.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.950
- What joke?
- Oh, it's a famous joke

01:59.019 --> 02:00.819
Told at all
the indian weddings.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.487
It goes like this.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.889
Carol, put out
your hand.

02:04.925 --> 02:08.260
Nikhil, put your hand
on top of carol's hand.

02:08.329 --> 02:11.162
Cherish this moment,
because it's the last time

02:11.198 --> 02:13.097
You'll ever
have the upper hand.

02:13.134 --> 02:16.101
(ramesh laughing)

02:16.236 --> 02:18.503
It feels kind of
old and dated.

02:18.506 --> 02:21.039
Ah, no. You see, because
carol's hand is here,

02:21.108 --> 02:22.307
And then nikhil's
hand goes on--

02:22.343 --> 02:24.109
Oh, I got it.

02:24.178 --> 02:25.944
It's just not funny.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.313
Oh.

02:38.459 --> 02:41.727
Ma, you think you chose big
enough centrepieces?

02:41.862 --> 02:44.128
Don't make fun. Your
cousin jane

02:44.165 --> 02:46.598
Had such small ones
at her wedding.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.835
Very cheap.
It made me so sad.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.603
These are big,

02:51.738 --> 02:52.937
Very high end.

02:52.973 --> 02:55.673
Mm. The asian flex.
Got it.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.210
Okay. Time for
poppa locka to limber up.

03:00.915 --> 03:02.648
Your california
cousins are coming!

03:02.650 --> 03:04.483
Tyson and
lily? So what?

03:04.485 --> 03:05.917
They party too much.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.352
Remember
your wedding?

03:07.354 --> 03:09.221
They kept yelling
they were turnip-ing.

03:09.223 --> 03:11.623
Ma, it's "turnt up."

03:11.692 --> 03:13.425
That was
16 years ago.

03:13.560 --> 03:15.494
I also heard tyson's
a pharmacist now.

03:15.629 --> 03:16.962
He just
call himself that

03:17.097 --> 03:18.896
Because they
legalized marijuana.

03:18.933 --> 03:21.533
Oh. What about lily?
She's got kids.

03:21.535 --> 03:25.103
Bac thuy told me lily is banned
from all the chuck e. Cheeses

03:25.172 --> 03:27.505
For starting fights with
other parents.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.075
You need to make sure
they don't cause trouble.

03:30.077 --> 03:32.244
The same thing carol did
for your wedding!

03:32.379 --> 03:36.514
Aw. I'd love to help,
but camille and I,

Well, mainly
because lily tran

04:34.374 --> 04:35.841

But hilary tran gets
