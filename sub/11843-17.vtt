I'll know more by then.

14:19.758 --> 14:21.817
Hey-

14:28.234 --> 14:30.168
What's wrong?

14:30.236 --> 14:33.103
Um, Max, I saw Topolsky last night.

14:33.172 --> 14:37.109
- You met her?
- No. I thought that I was meeting you.

14:37.176 --> 14:40.373
- She tricked you?
- Max, come on.just stop it, all right?

14:40.446 --> 14:44.212
- Don't you see what she's doing?
- Look, Max, I really think we should just trust her.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.945
No. No one is trying to help us.
just stay away from her.

14:47.019 --> 14:49.613
Max, it's not just about
you guys anymore, okay?

14:49.688 --> 14:51.850
Maria, Alex, and I--
we're on that list too.

14:51.924 --> 14:54.916
I think that we shouldjust
all have a say in all of this.

14:54.994 --> 14:56.985
What list?

14:58.563 --> 15:01.191
<i>[Alex]
So, she wore a wig, huh?</i>

15:01.266 --> 15:03.735
<i>[ Liz]
Alex, I mean, she was so scared.</i>

15:03.802 --> 15:05.861
I've never seen anyone
that scared before.

15:05.937 --> 15:08.736
- Taken a look at me lately?
- Don't you get it?

15:08.807 --> 15:11.401
This is exactly what she wants.
She has spooked the three of you.

15:11.476 --> 15:13.410
<i>And now she's
waiting for you...</i>

15:13.478 --> 15:15.537
to deliver the three of us
straight to the F.B.l.

15:15.613 --> 15:18.548
No, Michael. It's not three and three
anymore. It's the six of us now.

15:18.616 --> 15:20.812
<i>We need to start making
our decisions that way.</i>

15:20.885 --> 15:25.686
There's no decision to be made.
We trust no one. We never have, and we never will.

15:25.757 --> 15:29.216
If you think you can even begin
to understand what it's like to be us-

15:29.294 --> 15:32.093
I thinkwe're all
a little on edge right now.

15:32.163 --> 15:34.427
If there's a hunter out there,
who do you think he's coming for first?

15:34.499 --> 15:36.991
There is no hunter out there, okay?
This is insane.

15:37.068 --> 15:40.766
Can't you people smell a setup,
or am I the only one thinking straight here?

15:40.839 --> 15:43.740
Why don't we put it to a vote?

15:43.808 --> 15:46.607
Do we meet Topolsky
again or not?

15:46.678 --> 15:49.943
I say we meet,
hear what she has to say.

15:50.014 --> 15:51.948
I say we stay away.

15:52.016 --> 15:55.953
- I have to agree with Isabel.
- You know my vote.

15:56.020 --> 16:00.548
<i>But if anything happens
to any of you, I--</i>

16:00.625 --> 16:03.458
I think that's why
we need to meet her.

16:03.528 --> 16:05.462
I think we need protection, Max.

16:05.530 --> 16:08.761
Great. It's a tie.
Hell of a lot of good that did us.

16:10.034 --> 16:12.469
No. I-l don't think
we should go.

16:13.972 --> 16:17.499
<i>I mean, if you guys feel
that strongly about it...</i>

16:17.575 --> 16:20.567
who are we to tell Topolsky
anything about you?

16:20.645 --> 16:23.307
4-2, we stay away.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.464
Thanks for seeing it my way.

16:43.434 --> 16:46.404
I just really want this
to be over with.

16:55.647 --> 16:57.979
<i>[ Loud Clattering]</i>

17:33.918 --> 17:36.717
You left without saying
good-bye, Ms. Topolsky.

17:38.623 --> 17:42.355
- You okay?
- I'll never be okay again.

17:42.427 --> 17:44.361
You here to tell me about it?

17:44.429 --> 17:47.160
I'm here because
they won't listen to me.

17:47.231 --> 17:51.998
- Who?
- Max, Liz...

17:52.070 --> 17:54.061
<i>none oi 'em.</i>

17:54.138 --> 17:57.199
You're finally admitting
the F.B.l.'s investigating these kids.

17:57.275 --> 18:01.803
- It's much worse than that.
- You look like you could use a drink, Kathleen.

18:01.879 --> 18:05.008
- What do you say we go somewhere?
- No! No.

18:05.083 --> 18:09.145
Everything stays a secret now,
or I will never make it out of this.

18:09.220 --> 18:11.655
Make it out of what?

18:11.723 --> 18:14.693
Did you really think you could kill
Everett Hubble and not send up a red flag?

18:14.759 --> 18:20.596
- What do you know about Hubble?
- U.F.O. nut- they all get tracked.

18:20.665 --> 18:22.793
He found out about Max,
didn't he?

18:22.867 --> 18:25.495
At the convention.
That's why you had to kill him.

18:25.570 --> 18:28.733
You're protecting those kids, too, now,
aren't you?

18:28.806 --> 18:31.776
Why don't you just tell me
what the hell you're talking about?

18:33.611 --> 18:36.740
When my cover was blown,
I was sent back to Washington.

18:36.814 --> 18:39.181
That's when I found out
about the special unit.

18:40.318 --> 18:44.084
- Alien hunters.
- In the F.B.l.?

18:45.723 --> 18:50.217
I was the first agent to make
direct contact with- with the subject.

18:50.294 --> 18:55.198
<i>I spent four weeks being debriefed
by the agent in charge.</i>

18:55.266 --> 18:57.200
His name is Pierce.

18:57.268 --> 19:01.865
<i>And after what he did to me,
I'd hate to see how he'd treat the enemy.</i>

19:01.939 --> 19:04.135
<i>When it was over...</i>

19:04.208 --> 19:07.644
that's when he told me
I was theirs for life.

19:07.712 --> 19:10.147
Once you know about the unit,
you don't get out.

19:11.649 --> 19:14.209
Sounds elite.
So, what's the problem?

19:14.285 --> 19:16.447
The problem is
they kill people...

19:16.521 --> 19:18.819
and there is
no one to stop them.

19:18.890 --> 19:21.416
And that is not why
I became an agenLjim.

19:23.461 --> 19:25.987
So the F.B.l. thinks
that Max Evans is an alien.

19:26.064 --> 19:30.297
- Why don't they swoop in and pick him up?
- Why haven't you?

19:30.368 --> 19:33.804
<i>No solid proof,
fear of what he might do.</i>

19:33.871 --> 19:37.239
He's not the only one, you know.

19:37.308 --> 19:40.073
This is getting a little
far-fetched, I think.

19:40.144 --> 19:44.240
Your name is on that list. And you're not
the first person he's destroyed over this.

19:44.315 --> 19:47.683
<i>Now, I am trying to save your lives here,
but if you don't want my help-</i>

19:47.752 --> 19:50.084
Wait. Hold on. Whoa, whoa.

19:50.154 --> 19:52.953
Maybe we can get you some help.

19:53.024 --> 19:56.460
I already told you.
It is too late for that.

19:56.527 --> 19:58.518
And if you don't believe me...

19:58.596 --> 20:00.997
why don't you try asking
your friend Agent Stevens...

20:01.065 --> 20:03.625
what happened to him
when he tried to get out?

20:03.701 --> 20:07.763
Pierce made an example
out of him for the rest of us...

20:07.839 --> 20:09.967
piece...

20:10.041 --> 20:11.975
by Piece.

20:14.946 --> 20:17.813
Get them to trust me.

20:17.882 --> 20:19.816
It's the only way.

20:35.399 --> 20:38.664
<i>[Operator] Federal Bureau

20:45.777 --> 20:48.576
Agent Stevens no longer
works for the Bureau.

You can't deliver

just to get them off your back.

21:59.417 --> 22:01.078
What's that supposed to mean?

22:01.152 --> 22:04.952
It means, Michael, that I'm not
gonna settle for the Saturn Rings anymore.

22:05.022 --> 22:08.390

anything bad to happen to you?

26:58.449 --> 27:01.350

27:01.418 --> 27:04.877

27:09.293 --> 27:11.227

but they're my brothers, so-

27:22.806 --> 27:25.002
Isabel, I meant what I said-

27:26.443 --> 27:29.435
about having somebody.

<i>It's okay, Alex.

29:05.876 --> 29:10.712
She knows you'd want to see her,
hear what she has to say.

Why didn't she
just come herself?

29:12.850 --> 29:16.548

Michael, you have no table manners...

30:50.280 --> 30:52.510
<i>and all you do

30:57.187 --> 30:59.383

30:59.456 --> 31:02.153

It's not what he said. It's how he said it.
And how he knew to be there.

tell them, all right?

Yeah, our grisly deaths.
Look, Michael, I'm really scared, okay?

36:53.443 --> 36:55.605
I don't want to go through
with this anymore.

36:55.679 --> 36:58.478
I told you.
You can stay in the car.

36:58.548 --> 37:00.915
Pull over. Let me out.

37:00.984 --> 37:02.952
- I can't leave you out in the middle of nowhere!
- Fine!

37:18.668 --> 37:22.502
I don't get it. Why would he go
and do this after we all agreed?

37:22.572 --> 37:26.304
- Because he's Michael.
- That's no excuse this time!

37:32.682 --> 37:35.447
- Hey!
- Michael, it's a mistake.

37:35.518 --> 37:38.544
If you're too stupid not to protect
yourself, I'm gonna have to do it for you!

37:38.622 --> 37:40.818
This is not your decision to make!
This is mine.

37:40.890 --> 37:43.188
It's not just about you!
What you do affects me.

37:43.259 --> 37:46.854
That's how relationships work, and whether
you like it or not, we are in a relationship!

37:46.930 --> 37:50.423
<i>So go ahead and hate me,
but I'm not gonna let you get hurt.</i>

37:50.500 --> 37:52.491

So have I!

37:57.841 --> 38:02.779

- I am not gonna leave you!

38:08.818 --> 38:10.752
Give it to me.

38:10.820 --> 38:13.289

- I said give it to me!

38:13.356 --> 38:15.688
We trusted you with it,
and you blew it.

38:15.759 --> 38:19.354
It does something when it's with
another one, and I gotta find out what it is!

38:19.429 --> 38:21.955

<i>He stopped by my ofifice

I've been treating Kathleen

39:20.590 --> 39:23.184
Dr. Margoiin is a psychiatric specialist.

39:24.427 --> 39:27.920
She had a breakdown.
She's paranoid delusional.

39:27.997 --> 39:31.490
<i>That means that she's desperately

39:31.568 --> 39:33.969
<i>to the point that she makes
up elaborate scenarios...</i>

39:34.037 --> 39:36.665
<i>to justify the fears that she has.</i>

39:36.740 --> 39:39.835
