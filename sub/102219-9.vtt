07:23.818 --> 07:25.194

send me all our old contacts

07:27.822 --> 07:29.824
from Boland Motors and Bubbles.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.326

-Yeah.

-What?
-Mmm…

07:40.001 --> 07:42.170
-I don't want to jinx it.
-Oh, come on.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.381

07:46.424 --> 07:47.633

-The cops?

They're leaving.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.987
Never a good time, is it?

09:02.208 --> 09:04.502
I was just thinking before you leave,

09:04.585 --> 09:07.380
we could, um,
finally get that green juice.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.841
I can even bring it to the hotel
if that's easier.

09:12.134 --> 09:14.804
I don't know if you got my texts, but, um…

09:15.763 --> 09:17.974
Call me. Uh, okay, bye.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.355
How do you even know the money's there?

09:24.438 --> 09:25.648
I don't.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.776
You're just gonna
get her hopped up on green juice?

09:28.859 --> 09:30.069
Could always roofie her.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.575
Just to loosen her up, get her talking.

09:36.534 --> 09:40.204
You know what a little errand is?
Picking up the dry cleaning,

09:40.288 --> 09:43.249
dropping off a dog at the groomer,
getting milk.

09:44.041 --> 09:47.044
Breaking into a hotel room
to steal federal evidence

09:47.128 --> 09:49.255
is a kamikaze mission.

09:49.338 --> 09:50.298
It's suicide.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.466
That is what kamikaze is.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.469
That's exactly
why we have to get out of this town.

09:55.553 --> 09:56.679
[Stan] Y'all ready?

09:58.639 --> 09:59.807

10:01.892 --> 10:03.311

10:03.936 --> 10:04.770

10:08.482 --> 10:09.442
-Oh! Go ahead.
-Oh, no.

10:09.525 --> 10:11.319
-You take it.
-It's your house.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.486
It's my bags.

10:14.113 --> 10:14.947
[softly] Oy.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.243
[Beth sighs]

10:20.369 --> 10:22.371
-[Stan] So, last time--
-I was thinking--

10:23.080 --> 10:24.123
[sighs]

10:30.504 --> 10:33.132
Last time we hit the third grade,
now we do fourth.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.884
This way we don't repeat parents.

10:34.967 --> 10:38.262
Also, let's use a different house,
because… got new prospects.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.221
[Annie] Oh.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.390
What about Irish twins?

10:42.475 --> 10:43.392
What about them?

10:43.476 --> 10:46.812
Same parent. Could have a kid
in third grade and in fourth grade.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.106
-Not an issue.
-Making sure.

10:49.899 --> 10:54.528
So I figured that
we'd break this down into shifts

10:55.279 --> 10:56.656
maybe over a few days.

10:57.698 --> 11:00.409
And would that be
the most bang for our buck?

11:03.204 --> 11:06.874
Um, I guess we could double up in one day.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.211
I mean, the whole school thing.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.968
[chuckles] I mean, if it ain't broke…

11:18.719 --> 11:19.637
Okay.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.851
-If you see a problem…
-No, this should work.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.190
She sees a problem.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.318
No, not necessarily.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.654
[whistles] Real big one.

11:36.737 --> 11:37.988
Just a little snag.

11:41.867 --> 11:42.827
Hey.

11:43.661 --> 11:44.620
I'm all ears.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.456
It's kind of risky.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.417
-Here we go.
-Why?

11:52.211 --> 11:53.963
Well, who's on your mom chain right now?

11:55.673 --> 11:56.715
A bunch of people.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.926
And how many
fourth grade moms are on there?

11:59.009 --> 12:00.052
Um…

12:01.011 --> 12:02.012
Not a lot.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.224
-What's your point?
-Moms talk. A lot.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.434
Mmm-hmm.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.562
And it only takes one to smell a knockoff.

12:10.729 --> 12:12.148
Or it's safer.

12:13.190 --> 12:14.108
How's that?

12:14.191 --> 12:15.985
If someone finds out,
we can get ahead of it

12:16.068 --> 12:17.194
as we're on that mom chain.

12:17.278 --> 12:21.490
Or… they start another mom chain

12:21.574 --> 12:23.534
so they can talk
about you behind your back.

12:25.661 --> 12:27.037
How many mom chains are you on?

12:27.121 --> 12:29.165
Not a lot.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.167
And then Harry gets kicked out of school.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.502
-Come on, now.
-And we're all in cuffs.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.297
-That's never going to happen.
-Why take the chance?

12:48.142 --> 12:51.145
You know what? I'm just gonna shut up.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.163
You got a better idea?

13:10.372 --> 13:11.582
It's whatever you want to do.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.810
-Who are you?
-We are your halftime show.

14:12.893 --> 14:15.104
Yeah, I think we'll stick
with the main event.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.815
If you want to see their goods,
you're gonna have to buy ours.

14:17.898 --> 14:20.234
We got all the brands right here.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.194
So bust out that tip money, gentlemen.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.529
-We paid for this party.
-Yeah.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.573
No, you paid to get this party started.

-You can't do this.
-Oh, but we are.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.326

14:29.994 --> 14:31.412
What do we do with these purses?

14:31.495 --> 14:35.875
Give them to your wives
or your mistresses or your girlfriends.

14:35.958 --> 14:36.876
We really don't care.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.086
All right. How much?

14:39.169 --> 14:40.754
Start at two grand.

-What?
-Who carries that kind of cash?

14:42.423 --> 14:45.634

-Grab 'em while they're hot.
-No. What're you doing?

14:55.936 --> 14:57.187
I need to see those goods.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.856

-Okay. Thanks.

Fourth grade moms
would have been way riskier.

Are you kidding me?

16:01.126 --> 16:02.378
It's not that great.

16:02.461 --> 16:05.631
-How many cars do you sell in a month?
-Three hundred.

16:06.590 --> 16:07.758
-Three hundred.
-[chuckles]

16:07.841 --> 16:10.469
That is more than we'd sell in a quarter.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.429
Mmm. Well, I learned from the best.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.057
Aw, you always had the "It" factor.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.600
Nobody would have ever noticed

16:16.684 --> 16:18.519
if you hadn't pulled me
up to the big leagues.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.145
Best porter we ever had.

16:21.689 --> 16:22.523

16:24.108 --> 16:25.818
Okay. You ready?

16:26.568 --> 16:30.280
Hydrator, toner, tightener.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.573
It's great for the circles.

16:31.657 --> 16:34.076
-The dark circles under your eyes.
-I'll take one of each.

16:37.079 --> 16:39.790
Wait. You don't want me
to do the rest of my spiel?

16:40.582 --> 16:42.042
Nah, I don't need to.

16:44.628 --> 16:48.298
[spluttering] Yeah. I mean, you'll see.
I mean, it's really solid stuff.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.467
If you say so, I am in.

16:51.218 --> 16:55.389
And when you respond
the way I know you will,

16:55.472 --> 16:59.059
we can even talk
about other opportunities.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.353
-I'm pretty busy right now.
-No, I know.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.896
I'm just saying, in a slow month,

17:02.980 --> 17:05.941
it's an easy way to put
a little extra cash in your pocket.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.069
Pyramid schemes aren't really my thing.

17:14.825 --> 17:20.080
It's more of a… you know, community.
Men supporting each other.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.008
Ever think about coming back on the lot?

17:33.093 --> 17:34.344
Ah… [sighs]

17:36.013 --> 17:39.558
Mmm, nah. It's not…
It's not my bag anymore.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.686
Friend of mine over at,
um, Southfield Volvo

17:43.270 --> 17:45.773
said they're losing
one of their best sales guys.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.149
Southfield, huh?

17:47.232 --> 17:49.359
Hmm. I could put in a word.

17:50.277 --> 17:53.030
-I'm my own boss now.
-Just get lunch with the guy.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.741
-I also need a copy of the arrest file.
-[officer] It should be there.

-It's not.
-[officer] Hang on.

18:43.664 --> 18:44.873
[officer] I don't see it.

18:44.957 --> 18:47.209
Maybe they threw it out
when they threw out my case.

18:48.460 --> 18:50.379
[officer] No. No, here we go.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.380
[Phoebe] Hmm.

18:54.633 --> 18:55.592
Sign the release.

19:05.936 --> 19:06.854
That it?

19:08.564 --> 19:09.815
Why'd they throw out your case?

19:10.524 --> 19:13.026
Well, if I knew that,
I wouldn't be going home.

19:15.863 --> 19:17.739
Pays to have friends in high places, huh?

19:25.038 --> 19:26.248
Hey, Shel.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.042
I'm not sharing this.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.295
I need something from evidence.

19:34.548 --> 19:35.716
She was someone's daughter.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.595
Rather give you half my sandwich.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.015
You're the best.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.313
[cook] Order up.

19:51.106 --> 19:52.357
This is a little embarrassing.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.692
Hit me.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.194
You've got kids?

19:55.277 --> 19:56.403
Mmm-mmm.

19:56.486 --> 19:57.613
Married to the city.

19:57.696 --> 19:58.530
Ah.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.743
My daughter, she's nine,
she's a big MMA fan.

20:02.826 --> 20:06.079
-Mmm! Who's her favorite?
-[scoffs] Anyone who kicks ass.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.039
[laughs]

20:07.122 --> 20:09.708
-The whole girl power thing. Yeah.
-[chuckles] Right.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.752
So what can I do for you?

20:12.628 --> 20:13.837
-[waitress] Here you go.
-Mmm.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.590
I heard you're the ticket guy.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.176
How's that?

20:20.469 --> 20:22.638
Word is you got the hookup
for all the best fights.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.640
[chuckles] Says who?

20:24.723 --> 20:25.557
[chuckles]

20:27.768 --> 20:29.353
You can't be humble on Instagram.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.939
-Office seats.
-[chuckles] Hook a guy up?

20:32.022 --> 20:35.484
Those are usually reserved for donors,
Make-A-Wish kids, you know…

20:36.944 --> 20:38.070
What about murderers?

20:42.449 --> 20:43.825
I don't know anything about it.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.453
How'd they end up
with a gangbanger tied to a homicide?

20:48.205 --> 20:49.998
I guess maybe they scalped them.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.750
One of the cancer kids?

20:51.833 --> 20:52.960
Mmm.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.713
Sorry, what was your precinct?

20:56.797 --> 20:58.090
Fourteenth.

20:58.173 --> 20:59.174
Mmm.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.178
I'll see what I can do for your daughter.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.306
-Appreciate that.
-Yeah. Have a good day, Officer.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.307
You, too.

21:11.728 --> 21:14.898
And I've been using
the same shampoo bottle for a year.

21:14.982 --> 21:18.110
Just add water and shake.

21:18.735 --> 21:20.862
And I've never
bought ketchup or soy sauce.

21:20.946 --> 21:23.198
I have a whole drawer
dedicated to freebies.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.867
And I always order off the kids menu.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.413
No doubt about it.

21:29.496 --> 21:31.290
-You're poor.
-Yes.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.834
-Maybe the poorest I've ever seen.
-Thank you.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.211
But we can't grant you financial aid.

21:37.379 --> 21:38.839
Have you gotten to the part yet

21:38.922 --> 21:41.049
where we lived off a deer
for an entire winter?

21:41.883 --> 21:44.136
The problem is your drug charge.

21:44.803 --> 21:45.804
[sighs]

21:49.349 --> 21:50.434
I can explain.

21:50.517 --> 21:54.521
That was because a man tried to rape me
and when I wouldn't let him rape me--

21:54.604 --> 21:56.648
It's just school policy.

22:00.736 --> 22:03.655
The thing is, Ben loves this school.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.907
-We love Ben.
-Ben loves this school so much

22:05.991 --> 22:08.869
that he's one of those kids
that you see on a brochure

22:08.952 --> 22:11.747
that you're sure has to be an actor
because they're so happy.

22:11.830 --> 22:15.709
But actually, Ben is so happy at school.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.712
What about Ben's father?

22:23.091 --> 22:24.426
Isn't there any other way?

22:24.509 --> 22:27.054
Do you have a boyfriend? Domestic partner?

22:27.137 --> 22:29.348
Okay, well, now you're just rubbing it in.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.683
[sighs]

22:34.352 --> 22:37.314
Is there anyone
you get naked with regularly?

22:39.357 --> 22:42.235
-That counts?
-If they share your address.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.282
[engine idling]

23:05.842 --> 23:06.760
[grunts]

23:06.843 --> 23:07.844
Oh!

23:08.887 --> 23:10.222
[sighs]

23:10.305 --> 23:11.223
Jesus.

23:12.307 --> 23:13.308
I brought bagels.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.146
DWP was jackhammering all night.

23:18.855 --> 23:20.982
You want, uh, everything or poppy?

23:24.611 --> 23:25.904
I gave you a house key?

23:25.987 --> 23:27.656
Oh, I used the spare.

23:30.826 --> 23:31.701
[sighs]

23:36.456 --> 23:37.415
It's been a while.

23:38.875 --> 23:42.879
Yeah, I've got… Sorry. So busy--

23:42.963 --> 23:44.840
-Could've called.
-I lost my phone.

23:44.923 --> 23:46.508
Still liked my TikToks.

23:47.134 --> 23:48.552
Hey. Question.

23:48.635 --> 23:50.303
You don't have any kind of, like…

23:51.263 --> 23:53.640
Like a record
or anything like that, right?

23:54.724 --> 23:56.101
Huh?

23:56.184 --> 23:59.855
You know, like drug charges
or felonies, you know…

24:01.314 --> 24:02.399
[sighs]

24:05.819 --> 24:07.863
-What do you want?
-Nothing.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.282
You only come over
when you need something.

24:11.825 --> 24:16.496
Excuse me for trying to have
a nice breakfast moment

24:16.580 --> 24:20.375
with my… boyfriend.

24:21.209 --> 24:22.127
Wow.

24:23.170 --> 24:25.881
All right. Seriously, why are you here?

24:29.217 --> 24:31.094
Just… Here.

24:32.596 --> 24:35.390
Fill these out.
And for the address, just use mine.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.519
[muttering]

24:42.606 --> 24:43.523
[grunts]

24:43.607 --> 24:46.860
Well, if I do this,
you got to do something for me.

24:48.737 --> 24:51.406
I'm not really ready for the tattoo thing.

24:52.699 --> 24:54.075
Never come here again.

24:57.454 --> 24:58.288
Okay.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.001
[sighs]

25:03.585 --> 25:05.462
And leave the bagels.

25:07.505 --> 25:10.091
It's like my uniform, you know?
I don't even work out.

25:10.175 --> 25:11.051
Neither do I.

25:11.134 --> 25:13.053
But I still put 'em on every morning.

25:13.136 --> 25:15.472
That's why I focus on my accessories.

25:15.555 --> 25:17.265
Because I may not feel great in my jeans,

25:17.349 --> 25:19.434
but my bags, they always look hot.

25:19.517 --> 25:21.186
I wish I could afford it.

25:21.269 --> 25:22.979
Convince your husband that you need one.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.357
He just sent me
on a girls' trip to Chicago.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.567
-Ooh, fun.
-[Pete] Let's go, go, go! Come on.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.569
-Get your snack. Move it.
-Stop running.

25:29.653 --> 25:31.571
[Pete] Go forward.
Not gonna be late, okay?

25:31.655 --> 25:33.740
[Ellen] Hey, hon. This is Beth.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.326
Her oldest did Ladybug with Olivia.

25:37.452 --> 25:39.037
I feel so bad I didn't remember that.

25:39.120 --> 25:40.914
Please. It was forever ago.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.042
She's selling these cute bags.
Kim just bought one.

25:45.252 --> 25:46.378
How do you know Kim?

25:47.003 --> 25:48.171
Friend of a friend.

25:48.255 --> 25:49.798
[boy] Mom, where are the nuggets?

25:49.881 --> 25:51.967
In the freezer, where they always are.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.343
[boy] No, they're not.

25:53.426 --> 25:54.636
-Excuse me.
-[Beth chuckles]

26:00.850 --> 26:01.893
What is this?

26:01.977 --> 26:05.105
Never use your real info
when booking strippers.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.108
Do you want to get arrested?

26:08.191 --> 26:12.195
I want you and your friends
to all buy your wives a bag.

26:12.862 --> 26:14.155
Or maybe you're just dumb.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.825
No. Dumb would be thinking
that I didn't record

26:16.908 --> 26:18.368
everything the other night.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.788
[Ellen] Hey, babe. We're out of nuggets.

26:21.871 --> 26:25.166
I wanted to show you one more thing
because I forgot to bring the snakeskin.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.252
-Oh, that might be a bit much for me.
-Come on.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.129
You just have to channel
your inner stripper.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.505
[both chuckle]

26:31.256 --> 26:32.215
[Beth] Here it is.

26:33.758 --> 26:36.928
So this is from a trunk show
that we did the other night.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.221
Let's just get it.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.099
Babe, these are expensive.

26:41.182 --> 26:43.059
Call it an early birthday present, huh?

26:44.019 --> 26:44.936
Wow.

26:45.603 --> 26:47.605
Someone won the husband lottery, huh?

26:47.689 --> 26:49.024
I so did.

26:49.107 --> 26:50.233
[chuckles]

26:53.153 --> 26:55.655
Uh, maybe the other
guys' wives will dig them, huh?

26:55.739 --> 26:56.990
You kidding? They'd love them.

26:57.073 --> 26:59.200
I would really appreciate the referrals.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.248
What are all these emojis?

27:05.332 --> 27:07.334
That's everybody paying everybody.

27:07.417 --> 27:08.710
That's confusing.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.337
Okay, click there.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.507
So that's everyone paying you.

27:14.591 --> 27:15.967
You see? One emoji.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.053
Is that a middle finger?

27:18.636 --> 27:19.929
You did blackmail him.

27:20.013 --> 27:21.639
[both laugh]

27:26.728 --> 27:27.645
Happy hour?

27:27.729 --> 27:28.897
Very happy.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.608
-She got the money.
-Well, not all of it.

27:31.691 --> 27:34.486
A few guys want to pay in cash
because they don't want it on record.

27:36.196 --> 27:37.155
Cool.

27:41.785 --> 27:42.994
[mouthing]

27:45.121 --> 27:47.499
-Can somebody read my bio report?
-[Beth] What's it on?

27:48.083 --> 27:49.834
Cellular organelles.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.711
-Yeah, that's all you.
-[Ruby] Mmm-hmm.

27:52.504 --> 27:57.592
You know I was the queen
of cellular organelles back in the day.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.433
Is your account @themhills?

28:07.435 --> 28:08.395
Yep.

28:13.149 --> 28:14.275
And…

28:15.985 --> 28:17.612
that is your cut.

28:18.279 --> 28:19.906
Must feel good proving me wrong.

28:22.492 --> 28:23.827
Feels better to get the money.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.412
Like that's why you did it.

28:27.497 --> 28:28.498
What's your problem?

28:34.712 --> 28:35.672
You.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.801
-I'm sorry I didn't--
-Could've waited for the next party.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.553
-I saved our asses.
-You went back there

28:41.636 --> 28:43.138
as your ego couldn't take the hit.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.265
Okay, let's not talk about ego…

28:45.348 --> 28:46.766
Got ignored in your own home,

28:46.850 --> 28:48.685
-all you wanna do is matter.
-…Mr. My Bags.

28:50.019 --> 28:51.020
Excuse me?

28:51.104 --> 28:53.773
You use whoever you can
to get whatever you want.

28:56.067 --> 28:59.279
-I got you your money.
-You got my wife shot.

29:03.867 --> 29:05.076
And that's the least of it.

29:08.079 --> 29:11.166
If you think that I would ever
do anything to hurt her--

29:11.249 --> 29:14.294
I think that you don't think
about anyone but yourself, Beth.

29:18.256 --> 29:19.257
[Ruby] Ready to go?

29:23.178 --> 29:24.804
Yeah. Let me grab my jacket.

29:28.349 --> 29:29.476
[knock on door]

29:32.937 --> 29:34.189
What are you doing here?

29:35.273 --> 29:36.858
You want to have that green juice?

29:37.525 --> 29:38.610
I'm kind of over it.

29:39.194 --> 29:40.028
Good.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.280
'Cause that's why I brought this.

29:42.363 --> 29:43.823
I got work to do.

29:43.907 --> 29:46.618
Is that your version of
"gotta pick up the kids"?

29:46.701 --> 29:47.702
Only, mine is real.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.123
I'm not a total bitch.

29:56.795 --> 29:57.962
I only do shots.

30:01.591 --> 30:02.509
Here you go.

30:03.009 --> 30:05.678
-All right. Let me ask you something.
-You got a glass?

30:06.387 --> 30:09.974
Uh, your choice. Mug or sippy cup?

30:10.600 --> 30:11.684
-Never mind.
-Okay.

30:16.481 --> 30:18.650
What do you know about cars?

30:18.733 --> 30:21.194
-I know what I like.
-No. Like how they work.

30:21.277 --> 30:26.908
Like why is a Cadillac good for one guy,
but a BMW is great for someone else?

30:29.619 --> 30:31.913
I was really good at that.

30:32.580 --> 30:33.540
You're a natural.

30:34.374 --> 30:35.375
At cars.

30:38.419 --> 30:39.712
Think I see where this is going.

30:39.796 --> 30:41.923
You guys have been so incredible to me.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.133
When you were little,
what did you want to be?

30:44.217 --> 30:45.885
Easy. Astronaut.

30:46.761 --> 30:47.679
Stuntman.

30:48.513 --> 30:51.224
-Okay, so?
-You didn't know anything about cars.

30:51.307 --> 30:52.934
I know nothing about men's skincare.

30:53.017 --> 30:54.894
I had a better chance
at being an astronaut.

30:54.978 --> 30:57.730
You have something here
that you wouldn't have in outer space.

30:57.814 --> 30:58.648
What's that?

30:59.774 --> 31:00.692
This guy.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.028
It's just not for me.

31:07.574 --> 31:11.744
And look, I really hope that
I can still bike with you and the guys.

31:12.954 --> 31:15.206
Dude, you're my ride or die.

31:16.249 --> 31:17.208
-Come on.
-Thank you.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.710
Because you're mine, so…

31:18.793 --> 31:21.129
You just write me a check
for the product, we're good.

31:21.212 --> 31:22.130
Oh, okay.

31:22.213 --> 31:23.089
Um…

31:24.299 --> 31:27.844
So, I knew this was coming,
so I boxed it up.

31:27.927 --> 31:29.345
[clears throat]

31:31.890 --> 31:34.392
-These are just the samples.
-It's all you gave me.

31:36.603 --> 31:39.898
When you sign up,
you commit to product for the year.

31:43.985 --> 31:44.861
How much product?

31:46.029 --> 31:47.697
I got a whole garage full for you.

31:48.781 --> 31:49.824
[scoffs]

31:55.246 --> 31:57.832
-Maybe I'll give it another shot.
-Just gotta get your groove.

31:57.916 --> 31:58.833
[chuckles]

32:01.085 --> 32:03.504
What's the deal with local news
these days, anyways?

32:03.588 --> 32:06.174
It's like, what's the point,
unless you don't have a phone?

32:06.257 --> 32:09.427
Because I'm pretty sure by the time
you get home and it's 11:00 p.m.,

32:09.510 --> 32:13.473
you've been reading all about
everything that's been happening all day.

32:13.556 --> 32:17.852
It's kinda like, uh, when parents
send you a meme after six months

32:17.936 --> 32:20.396
and you're like,
"Um, that's not funny anymore, guys."

32:20.480 --> 32:23.316
[laughs] She was smoking in homeroom.

32:23.399 --> 32:25.360
I know. But why did you care so much?

32:25.443 --> 32:27.028
It's the principle of the thing.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.948
That's why you're so good at your job.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.241
Secondhand smoke causes lung cancer.

32:32.325 --> 32:34.035
You've always been a professional narc.

32:34.118 --> 32:35.161
Mmm.

32:35.244 --> 32:38.289
Then she told the whole school
that I got genital warts from my dad.

32:39.415 --> 32:40.959
I told her that in confidence.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.421
Last part was a joke.

32:45.505 --> 32:46.464
Oh.

32:48.174 --> 32:49.133
[Phoebe] Oh, come on.

32:49.217 --> 32:51.719
You would've done
the same thing to somebody like me.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.930
I honestly probably
wouldn't have even known you.

32:54.013 --> 32:56.182
Mmm. Well, I definitely
wasn't homecoming queen.

32:59.227 --> 33:00.353
Me, either.

33:00.436 --> 33:02.563
-Or on prom committee.
-Me, either.

33:04.440 --> 33:05.483
Or cheer squad.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.529
Okay, I was cheer squad.

33:09.612 --> 33:10.488
Ah-ha!

33:11.072 --> 33:12.115
[chuckles]

33:14.742 --> 33:17.787
-But I was kicked out.
-Partying?

33:20.748 --> 33:21.833
Um…

33:22.917 --> 33:25.461
-Manic-depressive mom.
-Sucks.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.423
If it makes you feel any better,

33:28.506 --> 33:30.508
I didn't make it
to any of the dances, either.

33:30.591 --> 33:32.051
Oh, I went to prom with my dad.

33:32.135 --> 33:36.389
And do not even get me started
on how useless the weather people are.

33:36.472 --> 33:37.473
[scoffs]

33:38.307 --> 33:40.351
My husband hates my best friend.

33:54.240 --> 33:57.201
So what I'm learning here is
you're basically a better person than me.

33:59.912 --> 34:01.581
I'm not so sure about that.

34:08.046 --> 34:10.715
[rap song playing over speakers]

34:16.471 --> 34:17.680
Don't forget the hook.

34:19.474 --> 34:20.475
[sighs]

34:24.353 --> 34:26.606
Ooh! Oh!

34:26.689 --> 34:27.815
There it is. [laughs]

34:27.899 --> 34:29.317
What's up? Now you're the coach?

34:29.400 --> 34:30.610
I used to beat your ass.

34:30.693 --> 34:31.944
[Rio laughs]

34:32.028 --> 34:33.446
Was that when we were in diapers?

34:33.529 --> 34:34.572
[panting]

34:36.032 --> 34:37.158
Well, what's up?

34:38.201 --> 34:39.202
Come teach me something.

34:41.370 --> 34:43.081
-Could get ugly.
-[Rio] Good.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.458
Let's see what you got, man.

34:55.301 --> 34:56.969
-You good?
-[Nick] Yeah.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.516
-Hands like this, right? [laughs]
-Yeah.

35:01.599 --> 35:02.600
[Rio laughs]

35:03.226 --> 35:04.060
[Nick] Oh!

35:08.022 --> 35:09.690
-Damn.
-[laughs]

35:09.774 --> 35:11.651
You pick up some moves
at that Ochoa fight?

35:11.734 --> 35:13.027
Kid kept dropping his hands.

35:13.111 --> 35:16.447
-That could get you into trouble.
-Or draws 'em in.

35:16.531 --> 35:17.782
[grunts]

35:19.283 --> 35:20.118
[chuckles]

35:21.160 --> 35:22.703
What was that knockout like?

35:23.204 --> 35:24.330
Boy got whooped.

35:24.413 --> 35:25.957
Nothing like ringside seats.

35:26.040 --> 35:28.000
Yeah, I could hear his whole nose explode.

35:28.709 --> 35:29.752
How's that?

35:31.963 --> 35:32.922
Come on, come on.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.843
[both grunting]

35:40.930 --> 35:41.931
[groans]

35:42.014 --> 35:43.558
Kid got cracked.

35:43.641 --> 35:44.475
[sighs]

35:45.101 --> 35:46.102
[grunts]

35:51.023 --> 35:51.899
[Nick] Yeah.

35:53.025 --> 35:57.196
Thing is,
you weren't at that fight, right?

36:02.243 --> 36:04.078
Too busy putting a bullet
in that girl's face.

36:08.040 --> 36:10.585
Sometimes I work weekends, bro. [sniffles]

36:14.547 --> 36:15.548
[Nick sighs]

36:18.843 --> 36:19.844
So…

36:21.846 --> 36:25.725
you were just gonna,
what, keep it to yourself?

36:27.059 --> 36:28.269
That don't concern you, dude.

36:28.978 --> 36:30.563
No, no. It does…

36:31.939 --> 36:33.941
when a cop ruins my breakfast order.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.319
I'll buy you some eggs. Come on.

36:37.278 --> 36:38.196
Did you do it for her?

36:39.655 --> 36:40.656
Huh?

36:41.782 --> 36:42.867
[Rio] Don't worry about it.

36:42.950 --> 36:46.412
Oh, gangster Rio had to whip it out?

36:48.706 --> 36:49.749
I got it covered.

36:49.832 --> 36:51.334
Show the soccer mom how big it is?

36:52.293 --> 36:53.336
She knows.

36:56.005 --> 36:57.006
[chuckles] Right.

36:57.548 --> 37:00.635
Aw, what's up? I wore you out already?

37:03.346 --> 37:04.639
No, cousin.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.099
Round two.

37:07.183 --> 37:08.976
All right, come on… Yo!

37:13.689 --> 37:14.774
What's that for?

37:19.820 --> 37:20.821
A doctor.

37:23.783 --> 37:24.742
That was quick.

37:24.825 --> 37:26.994
-So, there was this electrical line.
-Uh-huh.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.663
-For the streetlights.
-Cool.

37:28.746 --> 37:29.580
And it fell.

37:30.748 --> 37:31.832
Can I have that back?

37:31.916 --> 37:34.377
-On my house.
-On your car?

37:34.460 --> 37:36.629
I was fine because of
the whole rubber tire thing,

37:36.712 --> 37:39.423
but long story short,
it ignited the gas tank.

37:39.507 --> 37:41.676
And you're telling me this because?

37:44.845 --> 37:45.930
[indistinct chatter on TV]

37:46.013 --> 37:47.139
[door opens]

37:48.140 --> 37:49.642
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:50.726 --> 37:52.311
You want the good news or the bad news?

37:52.395 --> 37:53.271
Good.

37:54.480 --> 37:55.856
You can stay at St. Anne's.

37:56.691 --> 37:57.942
-How?
-Well--

37:58.025 --> 37:59.610
Yo, you're out of Q-tips.

38:03.239 --> 38:04.782
That's my toothbrush.

38:07.535 --> 38:08.661
I'll get you back.

38:10.621 --> 38:11.580
Roomie.

38:17.628 --> 38:20.631
In case it wasn't clear,
that's the bad news.

38:22.758 --> 38:24.051
[indistinct chatter]

38:28.306 --> 38:29.682
So, how'd you get it?

38:33.644 --> 38:35.104
Just being myself.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.609
Sometimes it's worth it.

38:43.404 --> 38:44.739
What are you going to buy?

38:45.865 --> 38:47.533
Something special for you.

38:52.204 --> 38:53.331
How'd you get that?

38:54.373 --> 38:55.207
[chuckles]

38:55.916 --> 38:57.251
Just being myself.

39:14.643 --> 39:15.478
Monkey?

39:16.645 --> 39:18.230
Thought Mom was picking you up.

39:26.572 --> 39:27.656
You awake?

39:29.116 --> 39:31.243
[inhales deeply] Mmm-hmm.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.915
I never did it for her.

39:41.879 --> 39:42.963
[grunts softly]

39:47.176 --> 39:48.219
Okay.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.555
I did it for me.

39:55.851 --> 39:56.685
Okay.

[sighs]

40:07.113 --> 40:08.531
What smells so good?

40:14.578 --> 40:15.663

40:19.083 --> 40:20.251
Chef Boyardee.

[music stops]

41:13.220 --> 41:14.263
That Washington?

41:15.014 --> 41:16.056
The Queen.

41:17.183 --> 41:19.977
Ugh, I hate Canadians.
