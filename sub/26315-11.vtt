WEBVTT

00:05.918 --> 00:07.529
It's called
a Christmas tree, Tammy.

00:07.572 --> 00:09.487
Or in Germany,
a Tannenbaum.

00:09.531 --> 00:11.141
I know what it's called,
Big Sauce.

00:11.185 --> 00:13.056
I just haven't seen one
in a long time.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.015
Don't they have
Christmas trees in prison?

00:15.058 --> 00:17.147
No, they kind of frown on joy.

00:17.191 --> 00:20.368
We're glad you're with
us this year, honey.

00:20.411 --> 00:21.717
Hey, since everyone's here,

00:21.760 --> 00:23.327
how about we draw names
for Secret Santa?

00:23.371 --> 00:25.938
Huh. I didn't think ol'
"socks and a candle"

00:25.982 --> 00:27.375
would be kick-starting it
this year.

00:27.418 --> 00:29.246
You said you liked them.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.640
And that was my gift to you.

00:31.683 --> 00:32.945
Hey, I got news for you.

00:32.989 --> 00:35.078
This year, I am winning
Secret Santa.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.471
Not a competition.

00:36.514 --> 00:37.863
Marjorie's right.

00:37.907 --> 00:40.083
It's an expression of
our love for each other...

00:40.127 --> 00:41.998
that Christy
always loses.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.523
Can we at least
up the limit?

00:45.567 --> 00:47.047
I mean, $25?

00:47.090 --> 00:49.701
What am I supposed to buy y'all,
a bag of dirt?

00:49.745 --> 00:52.617
Ooh, 25 bucks,
that's a little steep for me.

00:52.661 --> 00:54.097
No, that's just
a ceiling, Tammy.

00:54.141 --> 00:56.708
You can even make something.Like venison stew?

00:56.752 --> 00:58.493
Sure.

00:58.536 --> 00:59.929
Ooh! Stew it is.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.539
Oh! Secret, secret!

01:01.583 --> 01:05.630
Lord, I'm getting Bambi
in a bowl for Christmas.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.676
All right, everyone.

01:07.719 --> 01:09.721
Please pick with one hand,
eyes closed.

01:09.765 --> 01:11.071
If you choose your own name,

01:11.114 --> 01:13.029
you must...We know
the rules, Wendy.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.075
Do we? 'Cause last
year you picked

01:15.118 --> 01:17.033
your own name and
gave yourself cash.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.208
I know what I like.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.731
Hint: I'd like it again.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.516
Ugh.

01:21.559 --> 01:24.084
You do know whoever you
picked is in the room?

01:24.127 --> 01:27.130
Well, "ugh" isn't
always a bad thing.

01:27.174 --> 01:30.090
Ugh, that's a lovely sweater.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.396
Damn it, I wanted Bonnie.
Who's got Bonnie?

01:32.440 --> 01:33.528
Merry Christmas.

01:37.575 --> 01:40.839
Any chance we could,
uh, 86 the venison stew?

01:40.883 --> 01:42.754
Oh, sure. Where do
you stand on elk?

01:42.798 --> 01:44.060
CHRISTY:
Hey. Hey, hey.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.322
No requests.

01:45.366 --> 01:47.237
The point is to use
your imagination

01:47.281 --> 01:50.240
and think about the dear friend
you're buying a gift for.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.024
Ugh.

01:52.068 --> 01:54.070
♪

02:14.046 --> 02:15.222
Son of a bitch.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.833
There's the Plunkett
Christmas spirit.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.748
I'm in Secret Santa hell.

02:19.791 --> 02:21.750
Who'd you get?I'm not telling.

02:21.793 --> 02:23.534
Look at me.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.843
Wendy.

02:27.886 --> 02:29.497
How do you do that?

02:29.540 --> 02:32.674
That brief alien abduction
left me with some powers.

02:32.717 --> 02:34.850
It's embarrassing.

02:34.893 --> 02:36.373
We've been friends
with Wendy for years

02:36.417 --> 02:38.070
and I only know
three things about her.

02:38.114 --> 02:40.551
She's a nurse,
she's five foot three...

02:41.900 --> 02:43.075
Two things.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.382
Not to rub it in,
but I got blessed

02:45.426 --> 02:46.862
by the Secret Santa gods.

02:46.905 --> 02:48.211
You got Marjorie?

02:48.255 --> 02:50.082
Can we trade?
No way.

02:50.126 --> 02:51.606
In fact...

02:51.649 --> 02:53.564
"Cat pillow.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.436
"Add to cart.

02:55.479 --> 02:57.307
Confirm."
Ah, she'll be here Tuesday.

02:59.091 --> 03:01.224
No, you tell the driver
it was supposed to be

03:01.268 --> 03:03.661
three cases of tequila, not six.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.402
That's more than enough.

03:05.446 --> 03:06.708
Morning.

03:06.751 --> 03:08.753
Amazing. I hear
the word "tequila"

03:08.797 --> 03:10.451
and I immediately
want chips and salsa

03:10.494 --> 03:11.713
and to take my
clothes off.

03:11.756 --> 03:13.758
I hear "tequila"
and I want heroin.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.543
Isn't it funny
how our brains work?

03:17.675 --> 03:19.590
Oh, just a heads-up,
I got to get a deposit check

03:19.634 --> 03:20.765
to the wedding band.

03:20.809 --> 03:22.071
Yeah, well, you know
where the book is.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.638
You sign my name better
than I do, anyway.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.423
Yeah, but I feel dirty
when I don't ask first.

03:26.467 --> 03:27.990
Not really.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.339
All right, I'm out.

03:29.383 --> 03:30.775
Okay, honey.
Go get people drunk.

03:30.819 --> 03:33.474
And you continue to be
strangely cool with that.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.173
Hey. Real quick,
Christy and I were talking.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.783
Do you want to go out
for Christmas Eve

03:38.827 --> 03:40.481
or do you want to do it
here family style?

03:40.524 --> 03:42.744
Oh, yeah. About that...

03:42.787 --> 03:45.137
Tell me you're not working
Christmas Eve.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.618
I'm sorry,
it's a big night for bars.

03:47.662 --> 03:50.317
People are depressed
'cause they don't have families.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.796
Others are depressed
'cause they do.

03:53.668 --> 03:56.061
Plus, the Raiders are on
and that'll depress everyone.

03:56.105 --> 03:58.020
But you're welcome to join in
on the festivities.

03:58.063 --> 03:59.543
Great, so my choices are

03:59.587 --> 04:01.589
spend Christmas Eve
with my kid or in a bar.

04:01.632 --> 04:02.851
Nothing ever changes.

04:06.028 --> 04:07.812
You got your parole officer
a Christmas present?

04:07.856 --> 04:09.118
Oh, yeah. Juan's
been great.

04:09.161 --> 04:10.946
I got him a bottle
of aftershave.

04:10.989 --> 04:14.558
Eight bucks and it comes
with foot powder.

04:14.602 --> 04:17.126
Okay, let's get started.

04:17.169 --> 04:18.997
That's not Juan.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.608
Which one of
you is Tammy?

04:20.651 --> 04:22.305
Me.And who are you?

04:22.349 --> 04:24.438
I'm her ride; Juan's cool
with me hanging out.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.135
Juan's been reassigned.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.919
And I'm not cool.

04:27.963 --> 04:30.139
Wait, Juan's out?

04:30.182 --> 04:31.793
And this is how I'm
hearing about it?

04:31.836 --> 04:34.186
That's a kick in
the lady pants.

04:34.230 --> 04:37.189
I'm Eve Ferguson,
I'm in charge of your case.

04:37.233 --> 04:38.974
You can wait in the hallway.

04:39.017 --> 04:40.802
Oh. Okay.

04:40.845 --> 04:41.977
Guess you're
on your own.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.675
I'll be close.O-Okay.

04:44.719 --> 04:45.720
What is that?

04:45.763 --> 04:48.026
Oh, just some aftershave
for Juan.

04:48.070 --> 04:50.986
Which you are very welcome
to have.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.292
For your fella.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.684
Or your lady.

04:53.728 --> 04:57.645
Or yourself if you like
to smell like the sea.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.082
It comes with
foot powder... Oh.Stop talking.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.348
Okay, I see you have
a place to live

05:05.392 --> 05:07.219
and you're in a 12-step program.

05:07.263 --> 05:08.873
I don't see a job here.
You working?

05:08.917 --> 05:10.222
Uh, well, I...

05:10.266 --> 05:12.877
Handyman.
The bathroom's this way?

05:12.921 --> 05:15.184
Yeah, I've done
some handyman jobs.

05:15.227 --> 05:17.360
Uh, I don't see any pay stubs.

05:17.404 --> 05:18.970
No, it's more
of a barter situation.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.581
Trading the work
for food or rent.

05:20.624 --> 05:23.932
I did some plumbing
for Bonnie's fiancé at his bar.

05:23.975 --> 05:25.542
He's in a wheelchair,
if that helps.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.719
It doesn't.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.852
I'm gonna need some proof
of employment

05:30.895 --> 05:33.245
or I'm gonna be forced
to revoke your parole.

05:33.289 --> 05:35.422
Wait, what? Are you serious?

05:35.465 --> 05:37.685
Yes, and I'm gonna need it
by next Monday.

05:37.728 --> 05:38.816
That's Christmas Eve.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.775
Otherwise known as Monday.

05:40.818 --> 05:43.212
BONNIE:
Knock, knock.

05:43.255 --> 05:45.083
I just lost a dollar
in the vending machine.

05:45.127 --> 05:46.389
Who do I see about that?

05:46.433 --> 05:47.956
I'll take the dollar
or the Sprite.

05:50.567 --> 05:51.829
You need any help?

05:51.873 --> 05:53.091
You offering?

05:53.135 --> 05:55.137
No, but I can put the word out.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.008
What are you doing?

05:57.052 --> 05:59.968
I cracked the Christmas code.

06:00.011 --> 06:02.492
I tracked down Wendy's second
cousin in Staten Island

06:02.536 --> 06:05.060
who put me in touch
with one of her aunts in Newark.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.018
By the way,
there is a solid chance

06:07.062 --> 06:10.021
that one side of Wendy's family
is pretty mobbed up.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.546
Maybe I shouldn't be mean
to her anymore.

06:12.589 --> 06:15.375
Yeah, I'd hate to find you
frozen in a meat truck.

06:15.418 --> 06:18.116
Been there.
It's not fun.

06:19.683 --> 06:20.641
So what are you making?

06:20.684 --> 06:22.207
Wendy's grandmother used to make

06:22.251 --> 06:24.079
these peppermint meringue
cookies every Christmas.

06:24.122 --> 06:26.560
She's dead, I'm not, bam.

06:26.603 --> 06:30.259
Who's your Secret Santa
now, bitch?

06:30.302 --> 06:33.915
Impressive. It's no cat pillow,
but impressive.

06:33.958 --> 06:36.265
Any luck finding Tammy a job?

06:36.308 --> 06:38.180
Not yet. She didn't finish
high school,

06:38.223 --> 06:40.530
she hasn't worked in years,
she's not good with people.

06:40.574 --> 06:43.403
How the hell did Iget a job?

06:43.446 --> 06:45.448
Hey, where's our cookie sheet?

06:45.492 --> 06:48.582
Oh, sorry, I put it under my car
to catch the oil.

06:48.625 --> 06:51.280
Our good towels aren't doing
the trick anymore?

06:51.323 --> 06:53.413
Adam's got some fancy cookie
sheets at his apartment.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.763
I'll get you his keys.Adam bakes cookies?

06:55.806 --> 06:57.765
No. They've got old girlfriend
written all over them.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.854
In fact, after you're done,
throw them away.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.638
Oh, and grab a couple
of his good towels.

07:08.993 --> 07:11.474
[exhales]

07:11.518 --> 07:13.476

07:16.523 --> 07:19.003

07:19.047 --> 07:21.397
Uh, hello?Aah!

07:22.746 --> 07:24.487
You know, if you really
wanted to hurt me,

07:24.531 --> 07:25.662
there's knives right behind you.

07:25.706 --> 07:27.490
[chuckles]

07:27.534 --> 07:29.318
Yeah, yeah.
That would've made more sense.

07:29.361 --> 07:32.626
Uh... who are you?

07:32.669 --> 07:35.890
Daniel. I'm renting
this place for a month.

07:35.933 --> 07:38.153
You are?Yeah, Airbnb.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.546
Who are you?

07:39.589 --> 07:42.810
Christy.
Adam's my mom's fiancé.

07:42.853 --> 07:45.377
I came by to borrow
his baking sheets.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.510
I'm making
Christmas cookies,

07:47.554 --> 07:48.990
it's a Secret Santa thing.
Stop me

07:49.033 --> 07:50.513
when you have
enough information.

07:50.557 --> 07:53.211
Well, I can't say no
to Secret Santa.

07:53.255 --> 07:54.865
Thanks.

07:56.911 --> 07:58.652
Maybe I could

07:58.695 --> 08:01.089
come back and bring you
some cookies,

08:01.132 --> 08:02.830
if you're into that
kind of thing.

08:02.873 --> 08:04.048
I'd love that.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.094
Yeah?Yeah.

08:06.137 --> 08:09.532
Oh, but my boyfriend's
gluten-free.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.360
Uh-huh.

08:11.403 --> 08:15.364
Well, then, since we have no
future, get your own cookies.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.149
Merry Christmas.

09:36.706 --> 09:39.796
I needed cookie sheets
and my mom said you had some.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.798
Oh, yeah, an old girlfriend
left some at my place

09:41.842 --> 09:43.191
before she went crazy.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.193
So you have a type.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.717
Yeah, apparently.
I'll bring them over tonight.

09:47.761 --> 09:50.241
Too late.
Got them myself.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.723
And met the guy
renting your apartment.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.812
Oh. Huh.

09:55.856 --> 09:58.206
Yeah.You didn't tell
your mom, did you?

09:58.249 --> 10:01.731
No. I recognize sneaky behavior
when I see it.

10:01.775 --> 10:04.038
So what's going on, Sneak?

10:04.081 --> 10:08.520
Okay, contrary
to what you may see here,

10:08.564 --> 10:10.914
this bar is not
exactly trending.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.570
Oh, my God.

10:14.614 --> 10:18.356
You're open right now?

10:18.400 --> 10:20.881
This is the lunch rush.

10:20.924 --> 10:22.447
I'm sorry.

10:22.491 --> 10:25.929
Eh. It's not a disaster.

10:25.973 --> 10:26.930
I didn't say it was.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.280
I'm talking to myself.

10:29.324 --> 10:31.282
The nights are slow,

10:31.326 --> 10:34.459
the days are... this.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.200
I have no credit
with my vendors,

10:36.244 --> 10:37.854
so I have to pay
everything up front,

10:37.898 --> 10:39.726
including buying uniforms

10:39.769 --> 10:41.902
for the health inspector's
son's Little League team.

10:41.945 --> 10:44.644
[laughing]:
The Barrelworks Pirates.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.297
They're one and six.

10:46.341 --> 10:50.258
So you rent your place
and stay with us, all good.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.781
But why didn't you
tell my mom?

10:51.825 --> 10:53.696
'Cause I love her
and I'm gonna marry her,

10:53.740 --> 10:55.916
but I'm still
kind of afraid of her.

10:55.959 --> 10:58.309
Yeah, and just
a little heads up,

10:58.353 --> 11:00.311
that never goes away.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.662
Any chance we can
keep this between us?

11:02.705 --> 11:06.056
Aw, a Christmas lie.

11:06.100 --> 11:07.928
Now we really are family.Yeah.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.760
MARJORIE:
You did good, Bonnie.

11:13.803 --> 11:14.978
I'm proud of you.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.806
I don't think Taco Willy's
is a career,

11:16.850 --> 11:18.939
but it'll keep Tammy
out of jail.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.549
I get that we're
being supportive,

11:20.592 --> 11:23.465
but we're not really
eating here, right?

11:23.508 --> 11:26.120
Why?
I love this place.

11:26.163 --> 11:29.732
♪ Home of the ten-inch taco.

11:29.776 --> 11:33.910
God, there's so much
wrong with that.

11:33.954 --> 11:37.044
Welcome to Taco Willy's,
home of the... Hey!

11:37.087 --> 11:38.567
What are you guys doing here?

11:38.610 --> 11:40.047
Just showing a little support.

11:40.090 --> 11:42.745
Love the sombrero.Very jaunty.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.921
Thanks. A group
of high school kids

11:44.965 --> 11:46.357
just bagged on me pretty good,

11:46.401 --> 11:48.272
so I forgot to include
their utensils.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.014
So, you liking
the job?

11:51.058 --> 11:54.322
I'm loving it. No one here
knows I was in prison.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.759
I'm just Tammy.
From London.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.285
Ooh, the manager's giving me the
hairy eyeball, order something.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.939
I'll have
the ten-inch taco.

12:02.983 --> 12:05.072
All right, mild or en fuego?

12:05.115 --> 12:06.943
Uh, what the heck, en fuego
me.

12:08.379 --> 12:11.426
You know what? Just give us
a-a number one, a number four,

12:11.469 --> 12:15.038
an eight, and the aforementioned
ten inches of hot magic.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.824
And diet sodas
all around.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.608
Coming right up.
That's an uno,

12:19.651 --> 12:21.479
a quatro,and an ocho.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.830
I'm learning Spanish here, too.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.527
All right, that'll be $21.58.

12:25.570 --> 12:28.356
Only $21?

12:28.399 --> 12:32.142
One of those things
had shrimp in it.

12:32.186 --> 12:36.016
You guys, thank you so much
for visiting me at my job.

12:36.059 --> 12:39.367
And on behalf
of Taco Willy's, gracias.

12:43.719 --> 12:46.287
Wow, these cookies
are a slam dunk.

12:46.330 --> 12:48.985
Oh, yeah? Want to see
a slammier dunk?

12:49.029 --> 12:51.727
Check out this
cookie jar. Look.

12:51.771 --> 12:55.035
It's a bear that's a nurse.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.733
It's so tacky.
She'll love it.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.388
[phone rings]

13:00.431 --> 13:01.824
Hello?

13:01.868 --> 13:04.871
Hi, Mark.
Did you get my check?

13:04.914 --> 13:06.742
Well, that's weird.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.049
Yeah, I-I'll take care
of that right away.

13:09.092 --> 13:11.442
Yeah, thanks. Bye.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.270
What's going on?

13:13.314 --> 13:15.969
The check Adam gave me
for our wedding band bounced.

13:16.012 --> 13:19.755
Checks bounce all the time.
Especially at Christmas.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.322
Doesn't mean anything's wrong.

13:24.281 --> 13:25.761
Huh.

13:25.805 --> 13:29.417
All right, better get
wrapping on this.

13:29.460 --> 13:31.332
Unusual shape, could be tricky.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.855
Hold it.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.335
What do you know?

13:34.378 --> 13:37.033
Nothing.Look at me.

13:38.382 --> 13:40.167
Adam's having money trouble
at the bar.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.864
How do you know?

13:41.908 --> 13:43.953
He's renting out his apartment
for extra money.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.955
What? Why didn't
he tell me?

13:45.999 --> 13:47.652
I don't know.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.918
He's afraid of you.
You're a scary person.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.528
Did he really say that?

13:53.571 --> 13:55.835
Stop it, that's all you're
getting out of me.

13:57.358 --> 14:00.448
Damn it. Your powers are strong
during the holidays.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.715
Hey, there she is.We need to talk.

14:06.758 --> 14:10.110
Wow, Christy couldn't even
last a day.

14:10.153 --> 14:13.896
Don't blame her, she's weak.
How bad is it?

14:13.940 --> 14:15.942
It's not that bad.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.554
It's bad.

14:19.597 --> 14:21.425
So why have you
been lying to me?

14:21.469 --> 14:23.863
I wasn't lying,
I was just protecting you.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.561
I mean, you didn't need to know
I'm losing eight grand a month.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.780
Eight grand a month?!
What the... [stammers]

14:28.824 --> 14:30.826
No, no, don't be scary.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.700
You know what?

14:35.744 --> 14:37.877
I don't even care
about the money.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.530
I care about you.
I care about us.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.576
I mean, what kind of marriage
are we gonna have

14:41.619 --> 14:43.621
if we don't share
the good and the bad?

14:43.665 --> 14:46.015
I know. I-It's just...

14:46.059 --> 14:48.104
I'm a guy who rode a
snowboard off a cliff

14:48.148 --> 14:51.107
and thisfeels like the
stupidest thing I ever did.

14:52.630 --> 14:55.024
Okay, walk me through
the worst-case scenario here.

14:55.068 --> 14:58.549
It's 3:00 a.m., you can't sleep
because you're seeing...

14:58.593 --> 15:00.029
what?

15:00.073 --> 15:01.335
Well, the bar goes under.

15:01.378 --> 15:03.511
And?I'm completely humiliated.

15:03.554 --> 15:05.208
And?I've lost everything.

15:05.252 --> 15:06.731
Okay, but you haven't
lost everything,

15:06.775 --> 15:08.342
because I'm still
here with you.

15:08.385 --> 15:09.865
Even if I'm broke?

15:09.909 --> 15:11.519
Babe, I do broke
better than anyone.

15:11.562 --> 15:14.087
I got through
1991 on $11.

15:15.740 --> 15:17.351
So no more secrets, okay?

15:17.394 --> 15:19.179
You got to bring
this stuff to me.

15:19.222 --> 15:22.573
It's called intimacy, and
I'm told it's very important.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.708
Customers, customers,
go, go, go.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.710
Welcome to
AJ's Barrelworks.

15:28.753 --> 15:31.539
We have a very special beer
today, two for $8,000.

15:36.022 --> 15:37.980
Okay, we have time
for one more share.

15:38.024 --> 15:40.330
Tammy, alcoholic.GROUP: Hi, Tammy.

15:40.374 --> 15:42.376
Make that unemployed alcoholic.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.508
What? What happened?

15:44.552 --> 15:46.380
Everything was going
pretty good,

15:46.423 --> 15:49.600
and then this homeless guy walks
up to the drive-through window.

15:49.644 --> 15:52.429
He's only got a dollar, but
big-hearted Tammy hooks him up

15:52.473 --> 15:54.692
with a Loco Loco Meal
and a 48-ounce Mountain Dew.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.042
I mean, it's Christmas Eve.

15:56.085 --> 15:58.174
Leave it to me

15:58.218 --> 16:00.263
to get fired for trying
to do something nice.

16:01.917 --> 16:04.137
So now I got to go
to my parole officer

16:04.180 --> 16:07.357
with no job and nothing to
keep her from sending me back.

16:09.316 --> 16:11.448
Aw, hell...

16:11.492 --> 16:13.450
maybe that's best.

16:13.494 --> 16:16.018
I mean, if I can't keep
a job at a taco stand,

16:16.062 --> 16:17.846
there's no way
I'm staying out of jail.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.982
Anyway, I just wanted to say
thanks to you guys

16:23.025 --> 16:25.506
for being so welcoming
to me here

16:25.549 --> 16:28.335
and being such great friends.

16:28.378 --> 16:30.859
I'm gonna miss you.

16:34.776 --> 16:37.039
So you don't currently
have a job?

16:37.083 --> 16:38.388
No, ma'am, I do not.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.130
Well, you're not leaving me
much choice here.

16:41.174 --> 16:43.045
You've been out eight weeks,
no proof of employment.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.699
I don't know how
I'm gonna be able...

16:44.742 --> 16:46.440
Is it too late?
May we speak?

16:46.483 --> 16:47.789
What is going on here?

16:47.832 --> 16:49.573
We are character witnesses
for Tammy Diffendorf.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.314
Counselor.

16:51.358 --> 16:54.274
Actually, I'm not
really a lawyer yet....Just talk.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.711
In the short time we have known
Tammy Diffendorf,

16:56.754 --> 16:59.235
she has proven herself
to be a reliable

16:59.279 --> 17:01.281
and law-abiding member
of our community.

17:01.324 --> 17:03.761
She has joined
a 12-step program

17:03.805 --> 17:05.372
and everyone here
is willing to vouch for her...

17:05.415 --> 17:06.547
EVE:
Okay, stop.

17:06.590 --> 17:09.115
Okay? This is not
about character,

17:09.158 --> 17:12.118
it's about employment,
and there's nothing I can do.

17:12.161 --> 17:14.424
Well, that is ridiculous.
I want to talk to your manager.

17:16.818 --> 17:18.298
This isn't Neiman's.

17:18.341 --> 17:20.822
Oh.

17:20.865 --> 17:24.086
I'm sorry, but if she
does not have a job,

17:24.130 --> 17:25.609
she'll goes back to prison.

17:25.653 --> 17:27.916
Okay? That's all
there is to it.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.136
She does have a job.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.964
I need my porch painted. $300.

17:33.008 --> 17:35.619
And I need my gutters
cleaned out. $100.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.839
And I've got a big house.
Come over two times a week

17:37.882 --> 17:40.494
and we'll find
something wrong with it.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.759
Now, these have to be real jobs.

17:44.802 --> 17:47.849
I need to see invoices
and copies of checks.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.938
You'll get them.
We'll get her licensed,

17:49.981 --> 17:52.114
put together a website,
get her business cards.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.682
Tammy's Handys.

17:54.725 --> 17:56.249
We'll work on the name.

17:59.382 --> 18:03.038
I can't believe you guys are
doing this. Thank you so much.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.562
So this is good, right? I don't
have to go back to prison?

18:05.606 --> 18:08.043
I'll see you next Monday.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.697
No, that's New Year's Eve.Take the win.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.264
Oh, yeah, Monday, Monday.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.012
Nice!

18:21.056 --> 18:23.232
Okay, Gus, go mingle.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.063
Nice crowd
for a Christmas Eve.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.849
Right? I guess.
Oh, what the hell do I know?

18:31.893 --> 18:35.549
Hey, I thought of a way
to take a little stress off you.

18:35.592 --> 18:39.205
I'd love to,
but I'm kind of busy.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.337
Not that, you dumbass.

18:41.381 --> 18:43.948
I'm thinking maybe
we kick the wedding bells

18:43.992 --> 18:45.863
down the road a notch.

18:45.907 --> 18:48.039
You want to put the wedding off?

18:48.083 --> 18:49.432
Not forever, it's gonna happen,

18:49.476 --> 18:50.781
but all the money
we're spending on that

18:50.825 --> 18:52.348
could be put into this.

18:52.392 --> 18:55.177
You sure?

18:55.221 --> 18:58.963
Merry Christmas,
I'm not marrying you.

19:01.270 --> 19:04.578
I think my acid reflux
just went away.

19:04.621 --> 19:07.537
I love you.
[chuckles]

19:07.581 --> 19:09.235
Hey, Bonnie,
you're missing all the fun.

19:09.278 --> 19:10.801
I'll be right back.All right.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.370
Wow, nice jacket.

19:14.414 --> 19:15.545
Jill gave it to me.

19:15.589 --> 19:18.809
She said it was $25
and I believe her.

19:20.550 --> 19:24.206
I love it, Bonnie.
It's purrrr-fect.

19:24.250 --> 19:27.470
Please stop
saying that.

19:27.514 --> 19:30.560
My turn.Get ready.

19:30.604 --> 19:34.085
Oh! A nurse cookie jar.

19:34.129 --> 19:35.696
Thank you.

19:35.739 --> 19:37.219
Wait, look inside.

19:37.263 --> 19:40.483
And cookies, yum.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.485
Not just cookies.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.705
Those are your grandmother's
famous peppermint meringues

19:44.748 --> 19:45.923
she only made
at Christmas.

19:45.967 --> 19:48.056
My grandmother
never made cookies.

19:48.099 --> 19:50.711
She was a drunk
who shot off her own toe.

19:50.754 --> 19:54.584
Well, your cousin Dominic
in Newark begs to differ.

19:54.628 --> 19:56.325
I don't have
a cousin Dominic.

19:56.369 --> 19:58.545
What are you talking about?

19:58.588 --> 20:01.330
I found your whole mobbed-up
family on Facebook.

20:01.374 --> 20:02.940
Waste management?
Wink, wink.

20:02.984 --> 20:05.726
You got the wrong Wendy Harris,

20:05.769 --> 20:07.206
but thank you.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.208
It was really thoughtful.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.818
Do yourself a favor and never

20:10.861 --> 20:12.733
talk about that side
of my family again.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.129
Open mine,
open mine.

20:18.173 --> 20:22.612
Ooh, I wonder who it's from.

20:22.656 --> 20:26.050
Are You There, God?
It's Me, Margaret.

20:26.094 --> 20:27.617
Remember? You would
hide it under your mattress

20:27.661 --> 20:29.358
and we would read it
to each other every night.

20:29.402 --> 20:32.231
Tammy, I loved this book.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.536
Good job, honey.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.538
Yeah, you really
nailed Secret Santa.

20:35.582 --> 20:37.888
Oh, Jill,

20:37.932 --> 20:39.368
they left the price tag
on this.

20:39.412 --> 20:40.935
I know.
