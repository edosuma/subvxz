00:06.000 --> 00:07.416
[narrator] Previously on Hit & Run:

00:07.500 --> 00:09.000
[Newkirk] This motherfucker fell.

00:09.083 --> 00:11.833
He got his ass dragged, then picked up.

00:11.916 --> 00:12.958
[Segev] I was wrong about Isaac.

00:13.041 --> 00:14.708
Sending you a photo of the guy
who broke into my house.

00:14.791 --> 00:17.375
-That's Danielle's house?
-It's Sophie's. And her parents'.

00:17.458 --> 00:20.458
[Ron] Danielle Azulai never existed.
She's just a story. A lie.

00:20.541 --> 00:23.833
Look at us running around like crazies.
For a girl who doesn't exist?

00:23.916 --> 00:26.041
-Hi.
-[man] I called the fucking police.

00:26.125 --> 00:27.250
[Segev] What are you doing?

00:28.625 --> 00:29.458
Naomi.

00:29.541 --> 00:32.958
[Naomi] Whoever this Wexler is,
they have serious resources.

00:33.041 --> 00:36.541
If your wife knew Wexler,
it's time we start investigating her.

00:41.416 --> 00:43.791
[theme music playing]

01:09.625 --> 01:11.625
[siren wailing]

01:11.708 --> 01:13.708
[dramatic music playing]

01:19.125 --> 01:21.125
[indistinct chatter]

01:25.083 --> 01:25.916
Theodore.

01:26.583 --> 01:27.416
Ellis.

01:28.125 --> 01:30.333
Someone really fucked these guys up, huh?

01:31.541 --> 01:32.625
What do you think?

01:32.708 --> 01:35.875
This one was after the money,
that one was after the dame.

01:35.958 --> 01:36.833
What do you think?

01:36.916 --> 01:39.166
A couple of guys got dead
at the Tempest in Queens

01:39.250 --> 01:42.625
-and someone moved the bodies.
-You're the detective.

01:48.916 --> 01:50.583
[Omer] Sorry, I did my best.

01:51.666 --> 01:53.166
It doesn't help me, Omer.

01:54.208 --> 01:57.166
What can I do? This picture is blurry.
I'm not a magician.

01:58.375 --> 01:59.583
Sorry, sorry.

02:00.791 --> 02:01.916
I was hoping.

02:03.541 --> 02:06.666
-Yallah, leave the key under the-- Yeah.
-Under the plant. Yes.

02:07.750 --> 02:10.916
-Let me know if you need anything.
-I'll be good. Thanks.

02:12.208 --> 02:14.750
[Assaf] We fucked.
We didn't talk. We fucked.

02:15.916 --> 02:17.666
[Tamir] Must've been
a hell of a fuck, huh?

02:17.750 --> 02:19.083
[Assaf] Well, I guess not.

02:19.875 --> 02:22.458
She married this guy,
a year after I met her.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.083
Did you run a check on that guy?

02:26.375 --> 02:28.458
[Tamir] We know enough about the husband.

02:29.541 --> 02:31.916
Well, I can't really blame you.

02:33.166 --> 02:37.791
Nice girl. Pretty.
A good head on her shoulders.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.208
We all like to show off.

02:40.958 --> 02:43.166
But what she got out of you killed her.

02:43.625 --> 02:46.916
-I didn't share anything with her.
-Assaf, cut the shit.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
We saw you.

02:48.583 --> 02:50.083
What do you--? No, no.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.000
Whatever you think you saw...

02:54.041 --> 02:55.958
it's-- It's not what you think.

02:57.208 --> 03:00.416
For months you gave her
confidential information.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.333
Didn't you?

03:02.291 --> 03:04.416
-You don't make these mistakes.
-Come on.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.166
What is this shit now, man?

03:06.625 --> 03:10.666
All those months in the office surrounded
by conspiracies really fucked with you.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.916
For 30 years, I was good. I still am!

03:13.000 --> 03:15.875
-Twice I put my life on the line for you.
-We're thankful.

03:15.958 --> 03:19.416
You think I would betray my country,
after 30 years, for an American slut?

03:21.541 --> 03:24.708
Maybe she was just a little better
at her job.

03:47.583 --> 03:50.000
-I'll get you a ride back home.
-Huh?

03:50.708 --> 03:53.333
We don't need you anymore.
We're through. You can leave.

03:54.875 --> 03:57.250
Come escort him out. I don't have all day.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.125
It's fine. Fine.

04:14.875 --> 04:16.000
I'm fine!

04:16.083 --> 04:18.750
[suspenseful music playing]

04:24.041 --> 04:25.500
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.416
[computer scanning]

05:24.250 --> 05:25.416
[camera clicks]

05:28.541 --> 05:29.541
What are you doing?

05:30.708 --> 05:33.041
-Good morning, Sigal.
-To you too. What?

05:33.125 --> 05:36.250
Dror asked me to pull up some files
about the Sheinkin thing.

05:36.333 --> 05:38.000
So I was just checking it out.

05:38.083 --> 05:40.041
Dror asked you to get on his computer?

05:40.125 --> 05:42.041
-Sigal...
-Tali.

05:42.833 --> 05:46.458
...if you want to call him...
But careful, he's in a shitty mood.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.291
[ominous music playing]

05:58.208 --> 05:59.458
[cell phone ringing]

06:11.083 --> 06:11.916
Hey, Tali.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.416
Segev, the guy from the photo you had,
from the wedding,

06:15.500 --> 06:18.416
-He's an American, a cultural--
-Hey, wait, wait, wait a second.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.375
Wait a second. Not here. Don't talk.

06:20.458 --> 06:21.375
Okay.

06:22.041 --> 06:23.208
Here's what you do:

06:24.875 --> 06:27.416
Go to that one bar in Florentine,
the hipster one, okay?

06:27.500 --> 06:29.333
Wait there, I'll call you back.

06:53.416 --> 06:55.416
[man speaking indistinctly over PA]

06:57.083 --> 06:59.083
[door alarm chiming]

07:16.416 --> 07:17.958
Hi. Is Naomi here?

07:18.833 --> 07:20.833
-Segev.
-Henry.

07:21.541 --> 07:22.958
-We've met.
-Yeah.

07:24.833 --> 07:25.916
I'm the husband.

07:27.375 --> 07:29.791
I heard about your wife. My condolences.

07:29.875 --> 07:31.625
Hen, do you know where I put my--?

07:32.500 --> 07:33.375
Segev.

07:34.291 --> 07:36.791
What's wrong? Why didn't you call?

07:36.875 --> 07:40.000
-I think my phone is being traced.
-Traced?

07:40.083 --> 07:41.500
Really? By whom?

07:42.083 --> 07:43.458
What happened?

07:45.875 --> 07:47.833
-Give us a minute?
-We'll be late.

07:47.916 --> 07:48.791
[Naomi] We won't.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.416
I found a stack of passports
in her apartment.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.250
German, Australian. Different names.

07:55.333 --> 07:57.333
Were they stamped? Passports.

07:57.416 --> 08:00.125
Entrance stamps, exit stamps?

08:00.208 --> 08:02.458
-It's ten to. Calling an Uber.
-One second.

08:03.125 --> 08:05.250
If so, they passed airport security.

08:05.333 --> 08:07.750
If they passed, they're real.
Government-issued.

08:08.625 --> 08:10.750
Forgeries are impossible since 9/11.

08:11.666 --> 08:13.541
She had to be working for the government.

08:14.625 --> 08:16.208
So CIA?

08:16.291 --> 08:17.541
Then who's Wexler?

08:20.625 --> 08:24.291
I need to see all the passports
and anything else you have.

08:24.375 --> 08:26.750
Come to the apartment.
Documents, maps, a gun...

08:26.833 --> 08:28.791
-Wait. The fucking fundraiser.
-What?

08:28.875 --> 08:31.125
Henry's on the board, I can't skip it.

08:31.916 --> 08:35.041
Give me your address
and I'll be by as soon as I can.

08:36.000 --> 08:36.916
[Segev] Thank you.

08:46.375 --> 08:47.625
Chill dude.

08:47.708 --> 08:48.666
Stop.

08:50.083 --> 08:52.500
So, what's happening?

08:53.583 --> 08:54.958
Can I get in on it?

08:55.041 --> 08:57.625
Are you pulling a grift? Short con? Long?

08:57.708 --> 08:59.750
You need an inside man? Come on.

08:59.833 --> 09:02.208
-I can talk the lingo. Who's the mark?
-We should go.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.166
What's the skinny?

09:03.958 --> 09:06.250
You don't wanna be late
for the fucking fundraiser.

09:10.041 --> 09:12.041
[pop music playing over speakers]

09:15.541 --> 09:16.958
[cell phone ringing]

09:19.666 --> 09:20.625
-Segev.
-Excuse me.

09:20.708 --> 09:21.666
It's for me.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.875
[Segev] Tali, I got a burner.
Can you talk?

09:23.958 --> 09:26.833
Yes. He's an American, Scott Chase.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.375
Says he's a Cultural Affairs attaché,
but that's bullshit.

09:30.458 --> 09:33.500
Feels like government-related,
State Department or CIA.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.541
The death certificate is fishy too.

09:36.250 --> 09:38.583
-Go on.
-Says he died in Maryland.

09:39.166 --> 09:42.333
Like their covering his stay in Tel Aviv.
Like none of it ever happened.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.500
Listen, she might have been CIA.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.833
I found four different passports of her.

09:50.875 --> 09:53.875
Her name's not even Danielle.
Her name is Sophie.

09:54.500 --> 09:55.833
Sophie Dreyer.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.416
Fuck.

09:59.583 --> 10:02.333
But the guys who killed her were hit men
from New York.

10:02.416 --> 10:04.833
You think the CIA would do it?
Kill one of their own?

10:04.916 --> 10:07.916
I don't know.
I don't know what to think anymore.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.541
Just come back.

10:10.708 --> 10:12.333
You think I'm safer over there?

10:12.416 --> 10:13.416
Segev...

10:13.500 --> 10:16.916
I have to talk to Martin Wexler.
I'm pretty sure he's not her father.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.208
Listen up.

10:18.291 --> 10:21.416
Hang up the phone and try to lay low.
Okay? You're done for now.

10:22.041 --> 10:23.666
I'll call you later. Bye.

10:35.208 --> 10:36.791
[Segev] So it was a cockroach.

10:40.083 --> 10:41.625
Where are we going on the weekend?

10:41.708 --> 10:44.583
I don't know, Mr. Tour Guide.
Where are we going?

10:44.666 --> 10:46.333
-To a winery in the--
-Dani!

10:48.125 --> 10:49.541
-Dad?
-There you are.

10:51.791 --> 10:53.750
What are you doing here?

10:53.833 --> 10:56.250
I convinced them
to let me lay over at Ben Gurion

10:56.333 --> 10:57.833
on the way to Johannesburg.

10:57.916 --> 10:58.750
Oh?

10:59.250 --> 11:01.000
-Martin Wexler.
-Oh, sorry.

11:01.083 --> 11:02.250
My friend, Segev.

11:02.333 --> 11:04.708
-Segev Azulai, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

11:05.375 --> 11:06.833
I'll bring you a chair.

11:06.916 --> 11:10.791
-Why didn't you notify me?
-I tried. Twice. Straight to voicemail.

11:12.041 --> 11:15.333
I know I am just your boring old dad,

11:15.416 --> 11:20.041
but you should really try
calling me back once in a while.

11:23.041 --> 11:23.875
So?

11:24.708 --> 11:26.000
This is Segev?

11:27.166 --> 11:28.208
The Segev?

11:28.833 --> 11:31.208
She doesn't tell me anything,
but her mother let it slip

11:31.291 --> 11:33.625
that you and Dani are inseparable.

11:34.208 --> 11:36.208
Seems you've got her enraptured.

11:36.958 --> 11:38.041
I am very lucky.

11:38.583 --> 11:39.666
Mm-hm.

11:39.750 --> 11:40.625
Well...

11:41.541 --> 11:42.791
she looks very happy.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.291
If she's happy, I'm happy.

11:45.375 --> 11:46.583
Same here.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.416
-You've got a daughter, right?
-Yeah. Ella.

11:49.500 --> 11:53.666
So you can back me up on this.
Family is the most important thing.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.375
If you cut out on family,
you could lose everything.

11:57.166 --> 11:58.375
Am I right?

11:59.000 --> 11:59.833
Yeah.

12:00.875 --> 12:03.875
We all expected you back
for the reunion last month.

12:03.958 --> 12:04.833
Darling...

12:05.666 --> 12:08.166
you just disappeared,
you didn't even call.

12:08.250 --> 12:11.166
Your Aunt Cici's saying
she'll never invite you again.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.291
But you can make it up to her.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.833
Maybe we can bring Segev to the next one.

12:16.791 --> 12:18.375
-[Martin] Maybe.
-Hmm.

12:27.250 --> 12:29.416
-[Bennett] Beat-up van with roof rack.
-Plates?

12:30.333 --> 12:33.083
-That's our boys from the nightclub?
-Could be.

12:34.583 --> 12:37.333
-Was the van reported stolen?
-Nope.

12:39.041 --> 12:40.958
[Newkirk] Maybe she has a nasty boyfriend.

12:41.916 --> 12:42.750
Address?

12:43.416 --> 12:47.208
[Bennett] 6077 57th Ave, Queens, New York.

12:48.333 --> 12:50.333
[dramatic music playing]

13:30.166 --> 13:32.000
[Ella] You look so pretty, Dani.

13:32.083 --> 13:34.250
-Are you going to wear those?
-[Danielle] No.

13:34.333 --> 13:35.875
But maybe some flowers.

13:35.958 --> 13:39.625
[Ella] What about your high heels?
You have to wear your high heels.

13:39.708 --> 13:41.708
[Danielle] Then I'll be taller
than your dad.

13:43.458 --> 13:45.791
-[Ella] Uh-huh.
-[Danielle] Can you do me a favor, baby?

13:46.458 --> 13:48.250
[gasps] Go away, please.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.416
-What?
-What's going on in there?

13:51.500 --> 13:53.125
-I'll tell you later.
-I want to see.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.625
Tomorrow, Dad.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.000
For her.

14:00.125 --> 14:03.875
-[Ella] Did you write a speech?
-[Danielle] I'll need your help with that.

14:03.958 --> 14:06.958
-Can you give me a few words in Hebrew?
-[Ella] Yeah, like...

14:07.041 --> 14:08.416
[Ella speaks in Hebrew]

14:08.500 --> 14:09.875
That'll make him cry.

14:12.291 --> 14:14.708
Dad! I said, tomorrow.

14:14.791 --> 14:16.875
I didn't hear anything. What do you want?

14:16.958 --> 14:19.208
I'm getting some thread.
Swear you'll stay out.

14:19.291 --> 14:20.541
-Seriously, swear!
-I swear.

14:20.625 --> 14:23.625
-I'm not joking, Dad.
-I swear. Don't make such a big deal.

14:23.708 --> 14:26.125
Everybody knows it's bad luck
to see the dress before the wedding.

14:26.208 --> 14:28.041
-I won't. Okay. It's fine.
-I'm serious.

14:28.125 --> 14:29.125
I love you.

15:09.541 --> 15:10.791
What's up there?

15:10.875 --> 15:12.083
It might be bugged.

15:12.833 --> 15:15.291
-Where were you all week?
-I can't talk about it.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.541
You weren't at work
'cause you got fired, Assaf.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.750
I called them,
so cut with the bullshit for once.

15:20.708 --> 15:21.916
-What happened?
-Nothing.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.333
-You expect me to buy that?
-I messed up. Okay?

15:24.416 --> 15:26.750
You're good? You still wanna harp on it?
You're happy now?

28:44.416 --> 28:45.791
Where do you work?

28:46.375 --> 28:47.250
Uh...

28:48.250 --> 28:49.291
Everywhere.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.833
How do you know Naomi exactly?

28:52.916 --> 28:53.958
The Naomster?

28:54.041 --> 28:56.958
She and Segev and I, we met in Colombia.

28:57.041 --> 28:59.000
-White-water rafting.
-Mm.

28:59.625 --> 29:01.125
On the Rio Suarez.

29:01.208 --> 29:03.083
Or rather, she was. I don't do water.

29:03.166 --> 29:04.666
Of course. Cartagena.

29:07.875 --> 29:10.208
You mind? I have a doctor prescription.

29:10.291 --> 29:13.500
Well, I am an officer of the court.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.375
Oh, right.

29:21.916 --> 29:23.708
Yeah, Cartagena, yeah, we--

29:24.333 --> 29:26.791
The three of us,
we shared everything. You know...

29:27.666 --> 29:30.666
meals, apartments, toothbrush.

29:33.041 --> 29:35.208
She was much more fun back then.

29:35.291 --> 29:37.458
Before she wearing a suit.

29:37.541 --> 29:40.833
Not that she's not fun now,
but I never see her any--

29:42.833 --> 29:45.083
-What are you doing here?
-How does he know where you live?

29:45.166 --> 29:46.708
-Where were you?
-[Ron] I called you.

29:46.791 --> 29:48.541
Some crazy person answered.

29:48.625 --> 29:50.583
-I didn't know where to go.
-Where were you?

29:50.666 --> 29:53.083
-I have a burner.
-Wait.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.583
-Did they call?
-Who?

29:55.208 --> 29:56.458
Bro, the police.

29:56.958 --> 29:58.250
They found the van.

29:58.333 --> 30:00.625
It's under Jenny's name.
They came to her house.

30:00.708 --> 30:02.916
Some investigator was there.
I punched him in the face.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.416
I punched him, I knocked him out.

30:04.500 --> 30:06.625
Come on, man, I was about to get arrested.

30:06.708 --> 30:09.541
-We need to pack and get the fuck out.
-[Naomi] What are you guys talking about?

30:09.625 --> 30:12.083
Just leave the country. Today. To Canada.

30:12.166 --> 30:14.500
-Hey, motherfuckers. Hey!
-Just give me one second to think.

30:14.583 --> 30:16.333
What the fuck is going on?

30:19.208 --> 30:21.333
-We have to go. Sorry. Bye.
-[Ron] Come on.

30:26.875 --> 30:28.500
What the hell was that?

30:29.291 --> 30:30.291
I don't know.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.333
You speak Hebrew? I sure as hell don't.

30:35.416 --> 30:38.125
A murder?
What do I have to do with it? Thanks.

30:38.208 --> 30:40.375
That's what I'm trying to find out, Shaul.

30:42.250 --> 30:46.041
A few years back,
you talked to a journalist, Bill McAfree.

30:47.708 --> 30:48.791
Oh, that.

30:48.875 --> 30:51.250
Yeah, well, uh, I was stupid

30:51.333 --> 30:52.666
and angry.

30:52.750 --> 30:55.375
I retaliated after I got fired.
It was stupid.

30:56.458 --> 30:59.708
-That's why you stopped talking to him?
-Yeah, sure.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.375
Time did its thing. I calmed down and...

31:03.125 --> 31:05.125
Nobody told you to stop talking?

31:06.958 --> 31:07.958
Yeah, I did.

31:08.625 --> 31:10.083
That's not what I asked.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.750
You know it's a crime to hide evidence,
you understand?

31:15.833 --> 31:18.750
I don't know anything important.
I'm just a nobody.

31:18.833 --> 31:21.416
They fired me
because I couldn't keep my mouth shut

31:21.500 --> 31:24.125
about video games.
They thought I was a weirdo and...

31:24.208 --> 31:26.250
[dramatic music playing]

31:26.333 --> 31:27.250
Shaul.

31:30.708 --> 31:32.166
I don't know. It's just--

31:33.916 --> 31:37.250
-Somebody threatened me.
-Tell me who did it.

31:38.833 --> 31:41.250
Look at me. Shaul, we can protect you.

31:46.666 --> 31:48.791
His-- His name is...

31:51.083 --> 31:52.166
His name's Assaf.

31:52.708 --> 31:53.750
Assaf Talmor.

31:55.916 --> 31:56.791
Thank you.

32:04.541 --> 32:06.416
[cell phone buzzing]

32:13.416 --> 32:15.375
-Yeah?
-Uh, yeah.

32:15.458 --> 32:17.833
Hello. This is Tali Shapira,
with the police.

32:17.916 --> 32:20.833
Am I speaking with Assaf Talmor?

32:21.458 --> 32:22.500
What do you want?

32:23.625 --> 32:26.000
I need to talk to you
about Danielle Azulai.

32:31.708 --> 32:32.708
[cell phone beeps]

32:40.791 --> 32:42.416
What is she doing with that guy?

32:42.500 --> 32:45.458
-Who?
-Naomi, with that Henry prick.

32:45.541 --> 32:48.250
That fucking nerd.
Gets on my nerve, that spoiled fuck.

32:48.333 --> 32:49.541
What do you want from him?

32:50.708 --> 32:51.916
He's on to us.

32:52.541 --> 32:54.666
Don't ask me how, but I'm pretty sure.

32:54.750 --> 32:57.625
And I also noticed
that he doesn't like ya.

32:59.291 --> 33:00.833
Don't worry, Naomi's solid.

33:02.833 --> 33:05.791
If I'm gonna get life in prison,
I won't get to see Miles.

33:05.875 --> 33:08.833
Do you get it?
We gotta get out right now, Segev.

33:08.916 --> 33:11.500
I think your brain got fucked
from smoking. Calm down.

33:11.583 --> 33:14.500
-I haven't smoked anything.
-So then maybe you should. Sit.

33:19.375 --> 33:20.791
It's vegan. Eat.

33:30.208 --> 33:31.666
You're not alone in this.

33:33.291 --> 33:34.125
I'm here.

33:35.583 --> 33:36.416
We're good.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.750
Relax, okay? All right?

33:39.833 --> 33:40.750
Drink.

33:42.708 --> 33:43.708
I'll be right back.

33:54.958 --> 33:56.791
-[Ella] Hello?
-Elush.

33:56.875 --> 33:57.875
Hey, Dad!

33:57.958 --> 33:59.333
I missed you.

33:59.416 --> 34:02.583
Where are you calling from?
I don't recognize this number.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.416
Tell me, how about you?
What are you doing?

34:05.500 --> 34:06.875
Getting ready for school.

34:06.958 --> 34:08.250
How's school?

34:08.333 --> 34:09.375
Okay.

34:10.125 --> 34:12.666
-How's your mom?
-She's okay.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.291
Elush, quit it with this, "Okay, okay."

34:15.375 --> 34:17.333
Any other stuff going on in your life?

34:18.000 --> 34:20.375
-Grandpa's here.
-What?

34:20.458 --> 34:21.541
With you?

34:21.625 --> 34:24.041
No, he called from the airport.
He just landed.

34:24.125 --> 34:25.583
Is he on his way to Mom's?

34:25.666 --> 34:28.916
He's gonna buy me whatever I want,
and you can't stop us from abroad.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.291
-Let me talk to your mom.
-I gotta go, I can't hear you very well.

34:32.375 --> 34:35.916
Ella, please let me speak to your mom.
I need to talk to her, okay?

34:36.000 --> 34:39.000
You're not allowed to meet Grandpa Martin.
You're not allowed to go, all right?

34:39.083 --> 34:40.958
Yeah, Abba, I gotta go. Bye.

34:41.041 --> 34:42.083
Ella!

34:42.166 --> 34:44.708
[suspenseful music playing]

34:44.791 --> 34:46.333
-Wexler is in Israel.
-No.

34:46.416 --> 34:49.958
-[voicemail beeps]
-Tali, it's urgent. Wexler is in Israel.

34:50.041 --> 34:52.583
He's gonna get Ella.
Protect her till I get there.

34:52.666 --> 34:54.750
I'm on my way.
I'm getting on the next flight there.

34:54.833 --> 34:56.208
Come on, come on, leave!

34:57.083 --> 34:59.166
-[door opens]
-Fuck.

34:59.250 --> 35:01.625
[woman] I don't know,
some kind of midlife crisis.

35:02.250 --> 35:03.083
Excuse me.

35:03.833 --> 35:05.083
Fine, just terrified.

35:05.166 --> 35:08.000
Louise said in Rome
they reach into your purse...

35:08.083 --> 35:10.916
I have a family emergency.
I'm sorry. Thank you.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.000
This man who looks like a terrorist
pushed in front of me!

35:14.083 --> 35:17.750
-Flying to Tel Aviv, I need a seat.
-Let me check that for you.

35:18.958 --> 35:21.125
Did you have
a nice vacation here in New York?

35:21.208 --> 35:22.291
Yeah, very much.

35:25.000 --> 35:27.000
[ominous music playing]

35:29.625 --> 35:32.125
If you don't mind waiting one moment, sir.

35:44.541 --> 35:45.791
[woman] Someone help him!

35:45.875 --> 35:48.125
[crowd clamoring]

36:14.125 --> 36:16.791
[man over PA] The doors are closing.
Please hold on.

36:32.833 --> 36:34.833
[theme music playing]
