00:00.261 --> 00:02.480
Previously, on
"The Real Housewives
of Potomac"...

00:02.480 --> 00:04.004
Celebrants,
first communion.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.222
You're-
you're closer to God.

00:05.222 --> 00:06.441
Yes.

00:06.441 --> 00:08.269
So, Gizelle invited me
over to her house,

00:08.269 --> 00:11.968
and it pretty much
turned into an intervention.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.404
Juan was in the nail salon.

00:13.404 --> 00:15.319
Juan was in the laundry mat.
Juan was at the hotel.

00:15.319 --> 00:18.366
That's a Juan moment.

00:18.366 --> 00:20.237
Ashley brought
a new friend.

00:20.237 --> 00:21.673
- Hi.
- Ladies, this is
my friend, Nneka,

00:21.673 --> 00:22.761
I was telling you about.
- Nneka?

00:22.761 --> 00:25.112
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi.

00:25.112 --> 00:26.852
She's Nigerian.
She's Igbo.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.116
I was like,
"Oh, this awesome."
- Okay. Uh-huh.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.334
And then Ashley was like,

00:30.334 --> 00:32.554
"She brought up this article
about you."

00:32.554 --> 00:33.990
There was some rumor
about her family

00:33.990 --> 00:35.470
being shunned
or something.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.602
Did they say why
she was being shunned?

00:37.602 --> 00:39.430
They are Osu, cursed.

00:39.430 --> 00:41.519
I don't know if she is.
I know I'm not.

00:43.478 --> 00:46.524
Wendy's mom
calls my husband's cousin,

00:46.524 --> 00:48.831
and she started saying that
she has a shrine and that--

00:48.831 --> 00:50.224
She's doin' voodoo on you?

00:54.576 --> 00:56.839
I'm no angel
but give me some grace,

00:56.839 --> 00:59.842
and you'll learn
to adore me.

00:59.842 --> 01:01.409
You don't have to
dig for gold

01:01.409 --> 01:03.672
when you shine this bright.

01:03.672 --> 01:06.066
I just took a DNA test,
and it turns out,

01:06.066 --> 01:08.633
I 100% don't care.

01:08.633 --> 01:13.595
When they go low,
♪ I just hit high notes

01:13.595 --> 01:16.163
If you're gonna test
this professor,

01:16.163 --> 01:18.295
be prepared to fail.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.776
Nigeria raised me,
L.A. made me,

01:20.776 --> 01:23.126
and Potomac
will remember me.

01:23.126 --> 01:25.433
It doesn't matter
the size of our home.

01:25.433 --> 01:28.044
I'm always the queen
of this castle.

01:28.044 --> 01:29.393
I don't ride
the fence, honey.

01:29.393 --> 01:32.657
I am the fence.
You ride me.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.239
American Airlines
is where?

01:51.676 --> 01:53.113
There he is.

02:05.342 --> 02:07.475
- You're gonna drive me?
- Yes.

02:07.475 --> 02:09.651
I'm guessing there
is no gas in the car.

02:11.392 --> 02:12.871
No, there's no gas
in the car.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.093
How was your flight?

02:17.093 --> 02:20.140
I don't know why the pilots
like to drop so quickly.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.924
As much as you fly,
you're still scared

02:21.924 --> 02:23.143
about swift descents.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.188
I wouldn't say that
I'm scared-scared.

02:25.188 --> 02:27.756
You know,
I just don't like it.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.410
Well, I think that also goes
with the fact

02:29.410 --> 02:30.454
that you need
to stop traveling

02:30.454 --> 02:32.500
and, like,
find something here.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.589
And I'm telling you this-
this will be over soon.

02:34.589 --> 02:36.982
Soon, I'll be back
just like it used to be.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.507
I'm off the whole week.

02:39.507 --> 02:40.508
Let's see.

02:40.508 --> 02:42.031
Maybe I'm ovulating
that week.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.815
Let me check.
- You're always ovulating.

02:43.815 --> 02:46.862
I ovulate once a month
like every other woman.

02:46.862 --> 02:49.299
- Okay, babe.
- You're a doctor.

02:49.299 --> 02:52.259
Oh, I am gonna ovulate
while you're here.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.957
My husband, Iyke,
he does travel medicine.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.263
He travels for work.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.395
Twice a month, he'll leave
for one whole week,

02:58.395 --> 02:59.875
and then he'll be here
for one week.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.269
So, it's really challenging
to align our calendars

03:02.269 --> 03:04.445
when trying to conceive.

03:04.445 --> 03:06.925
Either way, I'm going to
the OBG for a quick fix.

03:06.925 --> 03:08.971
I need a solution here,
and then I have a baby,

03:08.971 --> 03:10.320
like, voila.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.627
Oh.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.281
Hello!

03:14.281 --> 03:16.631
Nneka, Karen Huger--
how are you?

03:16.631 --> 03:18.676
Oh, hello, Karen.
How are you doing?

03:18.676 --> 03:20.025
I'm good.

03:20.025 --> 03:23.377
I know you're super busy,
but I wanted to invite

03:23.377 --> 03:27.250
you and your hubby to come
play pickleball with Ray,

03:27.250 --> 03:30.035
myself, and the girls.
Are you guys up for that?

03:30.035 --> 03:33.125
Listen, somebody has to bring
this group back together.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.475
Candiace and Ashley
need healing.

03:34.475 --> 03:36.303
Candiace and Gizelle
need healing.

03:36.303 --> 03:37.913
For me, personally,
it's me and Robyn.

03:37.913 --> 03:41.873
And Juan is known
as the Don Juan, right now,

03:41.873 --> 03:43.223
wanderin' all around
the city.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.833
We all need healin'.
We a mess.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.183
Pickleball might
bring us together, though.

03:47.183 --> 03:49.185
Yes. Oh, my gosh,
that's gonna be so fun.

03:49.185 --> 03:51.448
Thank you.
- You are so welcome.

03:51.448 --> 03:53.058
I can't wait
to hang out with you.

03:53.058 --> 03:54.625
Likewise.
We'll see you tomorrow.

03:54.625 --> 03:56.018
- Thanks for the invite.
- Bye.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.367
- Bye.
- Bye.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.326
Well, that's gonna be
super fun, pickleball.

03:59.326 --> 04:01.980
Yeah. I don't know
what it is, babe.

04:01.980 --> 04:04.505
I don't either,
but I'm happy they invited us.

04:04.505 --> 04:06.333
That's really kind of them.
- Yeah.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.900
Babe, Karen said
all the ladies, right?

04:08.900 --> 04:11.642
So, that means Wendy.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.514
You know how aggressive
and-and upset

04:13.514 --> 04:15.385
she, and her sister,
and her mom were.

04:15.385 --> 04:18.345
Two weeks prior
to Ashley's housewarming,

04:18.345 --> 04:20.999
my in-law, Lebe,
who is my husband's cousin,

04:20.999 --> 04:25.830
she received a phone call
from Wendy's older sister, Ivy.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.310
There was some issue

04:27.310 --> 04:31.401
with you possibly
using her name to some extent,

04:31.401 --> 04:33.055
and there was anger

04:33.055 --> 04:35.753
because she felt that it was
somewhat of a clout chase.

04:35.753 --> 04:39.583
So, the next call I get,
is regarding messiness

04:39.583 --> 04:41.324
and shrine, and it's just--

04:41.324 --> 04:43.370
it's above
what I can comprehend

04:43.370 --> 04:46.416
and understand because
it's not something I dabble in.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.984
I've never had somebody
where it seemed like her,

04:48.984 --> 04:52.248
her sister, and her mom
were trying to prevent me

04:52.248 --> 04:54.555
from, like,
interacting with these women.

04:54.555 --> 04:59.124
Maybe instead of them to
see you as a fellow Nigerian,

04:59.124 --> 05:00.343
they're seeing you
as a Nigerian

05:00.343 --> 05:03.433
that maybe wanna
take somebody's spot.

05:03.433 --> 05:04.695
So, if that's the case,

05:04.695 --> 05:06.871
that's really disappointing
and alarming.

05:06.871 --> 05:10.222
But, babe, Karen said
all the ladies, right?

05:10.222 --> 05:11.702
I think she said
all the ladies and--

05:11.702 --> 05:13.487
- And their husbands.
- And their husbands.

05:13.487 --> 05:16.664
So, that means
your old college pal, Eddie.

05:16.664 --> 05:19.406
The one that disowned me?

05:19.406 --> 05:20.929
Disowned you? He--

05:20.929 --> 05:22.670
I don't know if he gettin'
a part of disownin' anybody.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.933
My husband went to University
of Maryland College Park,

05:24.933 --> 05:27.239
and Eddie attended
that same university.

05:27.239 --> 05:28.589
They were in the African
Student Association

05:28.589 --> 05:31.331
meetings together.
They-they know each other.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.072
Then, right after
his mother-in-law called

05:34.072 --> 05:35.900
about submitting my name
to a shrine,

05:35.900 --> 05:38.468
Wendy's husband unfollows
my husband on Facebook

05:38.468 --> 05:40.165
of all platforms.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.428
I think it's ridiculous.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.168
It sounds like Wendy
wears the skirt

05:43.168 --> 05:45.562
and the pants
in that house.

05:45.562 --> 05:48.652
Too much shade?
Was I mean?

05:48.652 --> 05:50.611
I don't know what to say
or what to think.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.613
I'm just gonna have
to feel his energy.

05:52.613 --> 05:54.223
Do I ask him
why he unfollowed me?

05:54.223 --> 05:55.616
Absolutely not.

05:55.616 --> 06:00.142
We're just gonna do our thing,
and that's it.

06:00.142 --> 06:03.319
Yeah.
Man, this is crazy.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.147
It's definitely
very baffling.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.453
We're almost home.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.542
So, you ready
to make a baby?

06:08.542 --> 06:10.152
Sure, after I spend your
money on some food

06:10.152 --> 06:11.806
and some cocktails.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.503
You gotta get me liquored up
if you want this.

06:23.557 --> 06:25.907
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi. Good. How are you?

06:25.907 --> 06:27.256
I'm meeting my girlfriend here,
just two.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.388
Awesome.
I'm gonna seat you right here.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.780
Is that okay?
- Okay, sure.

06:29.780 --> 06:32.348
- Hi, hi, hi.
- How are you?

06:32.348 --> 06:33.915
- How are you?
- Good.

06:33.915 --> 06:35.743
This place is, like,
packed, I think.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.179
I can't even
get in a chair.

06:37.179 --> 06:39.355
What's happening?

06:39.355 --> 06:40.661
Okay, whew.

06:40.661 --> 06:41.966
- Here's water, dear.
- Hi.

06:41.966 --> 06:43.403
- Thank you so much.
- Hello. How are you?

06:43.403 --> 06:44.752
Oh, I should've told you
to bring her one, too.

06:44.752 --> 06:45.883
I'm Jerata. I'll be
your server this evening.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.363
Anything I can start you
off with, ma'am?

06:47.363 --> 06:49.234
- Do y'all have tequila?
- We have Casamigos Reposado.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.411
- I'll have that, on ice.
- You want that one. On ice?

06:51.411 --> 06:52.847
- Yes.
- A single or a double?

06:52.847 --> 06:54.283
- Just double me up, baby.
- Double it. Let's do it.

06:54.283 --> 06:55.719
- Yes, yes.
- All right. Let's do it.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.155
How about you, dear?
- Can I get the spicy margarita?

06:57.155 --> 06:58.374
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

06:58.374 --> 07:00.507
- You're welcome.
- Um, how are the boys?

07:00.507 --> 07:02.813
From the growing pains,

07:02.813 --> 07:04.119
to the broken foot...
- Yeah.

07:04.119 --> 07:06.643
...to the sprained ACL.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.297
I feel like
it's always something.

07:08.297 --> 07:09.951
- I know that life.
- Yeah.

07:09.951 --> 07:12.693
The twins are getting ready
to have a birthday.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.999
Grace is coming up
on her last week of school.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.392
Wow.

07:16.392 --> 07:17.524
I'm coming down
to the end.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.873
Yes, you are.

07:18.873 --> 07:22.050
She's going in June,
all the way in Florida.

07:22.050 --> 07:23.921
I know. I know.
Let's just not talk about it.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.880
It's-- ahh!

07:25.880 --> 07:27.882
All right, ladies.
Here are those drinks,

07:27.882 --> 07:29.492
the Casamigos
double on the rocks

07:29.492 --> 07:30.580
for the sweetheart.

07:30.580 --> 07:31.799
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.061
And that spicy margarita
for you, dear.

07:33.061 --> 07:34.279
- Appreciate it.
- You're very welcome, guys.

07:34.279 --> 07:36.107
Okay, we would like
the giant pretzel.

07:36.107 --> 07:37.413
Absolutely.

07:37.413 --> 07:39.197
And then I would like
the, um, crabcake.

07:39.197 --> 07:40.329
Absolutely.

07:40.329 --> 07:41.635
Can I just do
a Caesar salad

07:41.635 --> 07:43.375
with blackened salmon?

07:43.375 --> 07:44.855
- I got you guys.
- Thank you. Thank you.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.509
- Thank you.
- Thank you. No problem.

07:46.509 --> 07:47.684
Um...

07:47.684 --> 07:48.772
You know, he called
you sweetheart.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.948
You-you attract
all the young men.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.603
I did. I-I was, like,

07:53.603 --> 07:56.345
looking at him like he's--
is he older than Jason?

07:56.345 --> 07:58.565
Is he younger than Jason?
- Right.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.305
How old are you, sir?

08:00.305 --> 08:01.916
He's definitely younger
than Jason.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.439
You're gettin'
all the young men.

08:03.439 --> 08:04.614
He looks like
he's in high school, okay?

08:04.614 --> 08:06.094
- Right.
- All right.

08:06.094 --> 08:07.922
Uh, we have to download
'cause I saw Karen recently.

08:07.922 --> 08:09.489
Yeah, she just--
she texted me

08:09.489 --> 08:10.838
while I was driving here.
- Oh.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.230
"Hi, Robyn.
Both you and Juan are invited

08:12.230 --> 08:14.494
to join the ladies
and their significant others

08:14.494 --> 08:18.019
for a fun game
of pickleball tomorrow."

08:18.019 --> 08:19.499
She did say, like,

08:19.499 --> 08:21.109
she's clearly open
to talk to Juan,

08:21.109 --> 08:24.547
not that Juan wants
to talk to her. Right.

08:24.547 --> 08:26.331
So, is Juan coming
to this pickleball?

08:26.331 --> 08:27.768
Yeah, he'll be there.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.334
You know, 'cause obviously
they have their opinion.

08:29.334 --> 08:30.640
- Right.
- As they should.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.643
And, you know,
as they should know,

08:33.643 --> 08:35.166
we don't care
about their opinion.

08:35.166 --> 08:38.692
I can't wait.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.998
If they wanna keep
talking about Juan, Juan,

08:40.998 --> 08:43.566
Juan, Juan, Juan,
then go for it.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.220
I'm not going to stop 'em.

08:45.220 --> 08:49.137
I did kinda wanna talk about
the other night with Juan.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.486
I mean, I know y'all talked,
but I couldn't--

08:50.486 --> 08:52.706
I didn't hear
what y'all said.

08:52.706 --> 08:55.491
Robyn and I
went to Atlanta

08:55.491 --> 08:57.406
to do our
"Reasonably Shady" live show

08:57.406 --> 08:59.495
on the Black Effect platform.

08:59.495 --> 09:02.193
Juan was in town...
with Robyn.

09:02.193 --> 09:04.631
Juan and I did have
a discussion in Atlanta

09:04.631 --> 09:08.112
as it relates to
all the social media fodder,

09:08.112 --> 09:11.638
and I don't want ever
to be in a situation

09:11.638 --> 09:13.814
in which, because
me and Juan have words,

09:13.814 --> 09:15.598
me and Robyn aren't good.

09:15.598 --> 09:17.644
He-he kinda came for me.

09:17.644 --> 09:19.123
So, you're saying
he was, like,

09:19.123 --> 09:21.517
yelling at you?
- Yelling at me, yeah,

09:21.517 --> 09:23.258
Because you told him,

09:23.258 --> 09:25.608
"Gizelle doesn't believe
anything that you have told me."

09:25.608 --> 09:27.262
- Right.
- So, in my mind,

09:27.262 --> 09:28.350
that's like kinda yelling.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.569
No. So, his--

09:29.569 --> 09:31.614
His hearing is bad
from coach-- like--

09:31.614 --> 09:33.573
- What?
- 'Cause he, like,

09:33.573 --> 09:35.400
yelled so much during,
like, coaching.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.576
Yeah.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.620
So, he, like,
talks even louder.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.056
- He was talking loud?
- Yeah.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.492
We don't need to talk
about what he said.

09:40.492 --> 09:41.798
Yeah.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.626
However, I'm just
gonna say he was, like,

09:43.626 --> 09:45.672
not happy with me.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.631
He did let me know
that he is, you know,

09:48.631 --> 09:50.720
a sexual dude,
as most dudes are.

09:50.720 --> 09:53.375
He did have some excuses.

09:53.375 --> 09:55.116
He did not.
He did not.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.074
"I did not, Gizelle.
I did not have sex with her."

09:57.074 --> 09:59.903
So, I'm like,
okay, you said it--

09:59.903 --> 10:02.036
you said it about four times.
One time was enough.

10:02.036 --> 10:06.606
Girl, stop.
Juan was not yelling at you.

10:06.606 --> 10:10.174
He said, "I didn't
stick my thing in her,"

10:10.174 --> 10:11.872
something like that.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.743
He said
something like that.

10:13.743 --> 10:17.442
I don't have anything
more to say here.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.053
I guess, the way
I look at it is,

10:19.053 --> 10:20.837
y'all don't have to see
eye to eye.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.056
No.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.361
I mean, the story
is not gonna change.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.233
It's--
oh, he made that clear.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.626
Oh, wow.
- Thank you.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.671
- And also, a crabcake.
- Oh, wow.

10:28.671 --> 10:29.716
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.065
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

10:31.065 --> 10:32.588
Thank you, guys
- Are you a high school student?

10:32.588 --> 10:33.981
No, I'm actually not.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.331
I'm 28-28.
- Oh, you're 28.

10:36.331 --> 10:37.985
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, okay.

10:37.985 --> 10:39.595
I know I got
the youthful face.

10:39.595 --> 10:40.857
- Yes.
- But you guys enjoy, okay?

10:40.857 --> 10:42.729
- Thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.121
Okay, so,
we were both wrong.

10:44.121 --> 10:45.775
Right, I just said
younger than Jason,

10:45.775 --> 10:47.342
so I was right.

10:47.342 --> 10:48.343
- So, you were right.
- Yeah.

10:48.343 --> 10:49.736
- I was wrong.
- Yeah.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.695
I shouldn't bite,
but I will.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.436
Is it good? Okay.

10:54.436 --> 10:58.440
All right, so, I should not
be telling you this.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.398
Oh, okay, good.
Tell me.

11:02.226 --> 11:05.142
Because I was asked--

11:05.142 --> 11:07.797
- Not to say anything?
- Not to tell anyone.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.756
If we can keep this
between the two of us for now--

11:09.756 --> 11:11.279
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.455
So, this is, like, the craziest
sh-- I've ever heard.

11:13.455 --> 11:14.761
Okay.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.372
Nneka's cousin has been
really close friends

11:17.372 --> 11:18.939
with Wendy's sister, Ivy.

11:18.939 --> 11:21.376
- Okay, that's weird.
- So, recently,

11:21.376 --> 11:24.292
the cousin got a phone call
from Wendy's sister

11:24.292 --> 11:26.990
saying that Wendy is pissed

11:26.990 --> 11:30.646
because she found out
that Nneka has told people

11:30.646 --> 11:33.344
that she knows Wendy,

11:33.344 --> 11:34.781
or that she
has met Wendy,

11:34.781 --> 11:36.608
or that she has
some sort of, you know,

11:36.608 --> 11:37.958
interaction with Wendy.

11:37.958 --> 11:41.483
She has told somebody
that she met Wendy.

11:41.483 --> 11:42.963
Why is that a problem?

11:42.963 --> 11:44.965
Oh, it's a big problem.
She's pissed.

11:44.965 --> 11:46.662
They came from
the same tribe, right?

11:46.662 --> 11:48.055
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

11:48.055 --> 11:49.317
So, Wendy wants to be
the only person

11:49.317 --> 11:51.101
from that tribe that we know?

11:51.101 --> 11:52.842
That's what it sounded like.

11:52.842 --> 11:55.149
- This sounds crazy to me.
- That's what it sounds like.

11:55.149 --> 11:59.153
So, then Wendy's mama
calls the cousin and says,

11:59.153 --> 12:03.157
"People who use
people's names are sinners.

12:03.157 --> 12:06.682
And ask about me.
I have a shrine.

12:06.682 --> 12:10.164
And I have prayed
against people."

12:10.164 --> 12:12.079
- So, she's a voodoo hexer.
- That what it sounded like.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.994
She's doing voodoo
on people.

12:13.994 --> 12:16.344
Listen, I used to
be married to a pastor.

12:16.344 --> 12:19.260
A shrine and praying against
someone's family and downfall

12:19.260 --> 12:22.045
is nothing to play with.

12:22.045 --> 12:25.135
And I want no parts.
I want no parts.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.007
I hope it's not true.
- That's----ed up.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.226
- It's beyond----ed up.
- That's----ed up.

12:29.226 --> 12:30.662
It's evil.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.360
- Yeah.
- Whew.

12:33.840 --> 12:35.580
Coming up next...

12:35.580 --> 12:37.626
My mom worships
our Lord and Savior.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.019
At day.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.890
By night, she's-she's
submitting names to shrines.

12:41.761 --> 12:46.243
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- Oh, gosh.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.506
This is the demons
coming to get us.

12:58.952 --> 13:01.084
- Ma!
- Yes!

13:01.084 --> 13:03.130
What are you doing?

13:07.656 --> 13:09.223
How are you?

13:09.223 --> 13:10.964
I'm, um--

13:10.964 --> 13:12.748
you know, this dishwasher
is not very good,

13:12.748 --> 13:14.402
so I have to, like,

13:14.402 --> 13:15.664
put the soap on it.
- Well, you've been talking
about it.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.144
You've been talking
about both of 'em

13:17.144 --> 13:18.710
for three years now.
- I know.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.843
I just-- I need
to buy new ones.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.453
So, maybe I need to
get you two new ones

13:22.453 --> 13:23.846
for Christmas or something.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.153
Oh, can you get me,
like, a tour gift

13:26.153 --> 13:28.024
'cause I'm going back on tour?
- A tour gift?

13:28.024 --> 13:29.504
Give me, like,
a congratulations.

13:29.504 --> 13:30.853
- Okay.
- In June,

13:30.853 --> 13:31.941
you can get me a--
'cause I'm doing a DC show.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.813
- Two new ones in-- okay.
- Yes,

13:33.813 --> 13:36.511
a congratulations gift.

13:36.511 --> 13:39.862
My mom seeing me
as an artist

13:39.862 --> 13:41.864
has perhaps helped her
to grow

13:41.864 --> 13:43.997
a newfound respect for me,

13:43.997 --> 13:46.260
and it's been really nice.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.044
Well, what's-what's
in your head?

13:48.044 --> 13:49.959
Where is your head?
I don't know how you think.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.092
Your brain must be,
you know,

13:52.092 --> 13:53.354
twisted and backwards.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.834
And now, now you're
insulting my brain.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.879
You're the narcissist.
You're the brat.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.794
You're the little princess.
You're the diva.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.535
That's you.

14:01.797 --> 14:03.973
I mean, we still get
to tussling every now and then,

14:03.973 --> 14:05.757
but it's less.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.716
Thank you, Jesus,
for less.

14:07.716 --> 14:10.240
Our little outdoor space.
- Beautiful.

14:12.025 --> 14:13.896
Okay, this is
a little bit better.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.158
Okay, yes.

14:15.158 --> 14:17.073
- So, the tour...
- Yeah.

14:17.073 --> 14:19.162
You're getting it back
into the swing of things.

14:19.162 --> 14:20.990
Yeah, it's
coming together.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.993
I'm just--
I'm, like, I'm a little--

14:26.082 --> 14:29.999
I just-- last year,

14:29.999 --> 14:31.740
it was a promotional tour.
- Right.

14:31.740 --> 14:35.352
Which means I spent
so much money

14:35.352 --> 14:37.006
my first go around.
- Mm-hmm, to get the exposure.

14:37.006 --> 14:38.486
Right, you're getting
that exposure.

14:38.486 --> 14:39.879
Right, to get the exposure,
to get people to see me.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.750
- Mm-hmm.
- And so, this go around,

14:41.750 --> 14:43.404
I'm getting more cities.
- Yay, yay, yay.

14:43.404 --> 14:44.971
So, the promotional tour worked.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.320
- Okay.
- It's just...

14:46.320 --> 14:48.931
I cannot spend

14:48.931 --> 14:50.715
that much money, again.
- Mm-hmm, right.

14:50.715 --> 14:53.544
Road life is ghetto.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.372
It's raggedy, it's ashy.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.897
It's dry.
Like, there's no moisture.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.334
It's not glamourous
at all.

15:00.334 --> 15:05.208
The upside is that I love
the energy that I get

15:05.208 --> 15:08.211
from the people that
come from far and wide

15:08.211 --> 15:12.041
to hear me scream
into a microphone.

15:12.041 --> 15:15.958
Chris was, like,
screaming at me.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.351
Okay.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.440
Just all the money
that we were spending.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.398
- Okay.
- Yeah.

15:21.398 --> 15:25.228
So, Nye sent me a preliminary
budget for the tour.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.229
Mm-hmm.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.753
And it's a lot of money.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.886
First thing I'm gonna say is,
do you need dancers?

15:30.886 --> 15:32.279
Do you need a band?

15:32.279 --> 15:33.715
- Why you looking like that?
- Okay, well--

15:33.715 --> 15:34.846
Like what?

15:34.846 --> 15:36.326
Why-why you
looking like that?

15:36.326 --> 15:38.024
- I'm not looking like anything.
- You are looking crazy.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.982
So, what is Chris
working on, right now?

15:39.982 --> 15:41.418
He's still doing
virtual classes,

15:41.418 --> 15:43.072
private chef events, um...
- Mm-hmm.

15:43.072 --> 15:44.944
He's making money
with that?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.597
No, Mom, he's
not making anything.

15:46.597 --> 15:49.078
I wasn't trying to be shady
or anything, Candiace.

15:49.078 --> 15:50.950
Well, what do you--
I mean--

15:50.950 --> 15:52.690
That's just what I--
that's just what I do.

15:52.690 --> 15:55.911
I just, you know, sit,
and we talk about everything.

15:55.911 --> 15:58.783
You haven't changed a bit.

15:58.783 --> 16:00.611
He is-- he is
making money.

16:00.611 --> 16:02.962
So, he's happy
with-with what he's doing?

16:02.962 --> 16:05.094
Our biggest
arguments were

16:05.094 --> 16:07.662
about his work schedule.
- Mm-hmm, right.

16:07.662 --> 16:11.187
So, when Chris was
closing the restaurant,

16:11.187 --> 16:14.886
12-hour days,
that was hard on me

16:14.886 --> 16:17.280
and, therefore,
hard on our marriage.

16:17.280 --> 16:22.198
I don't love
your work-life balance.

16:22.198 --> 16:24.374
If they book a----ing event
for 500 people,

16:24.374 --> 16:26.202
guess who has to be there.
- If you cuss at me
one more time.

16:26.202 --> 16:28.988
So, he left because
happy wife, happy life.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.076
Okay, catch it.

16:30.076 --> 16:31.207
There's snacks in here,

16:31.207 --> 16:32.426
so do you want me
to grab you a snack?

16:32.426 --> 16:33.557
Sure, yeah.

16:33.557 --> 16:34.776
I'll get you some
more wine, too.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.865
Hold, please.
- Okay, just a little bit.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.519
Is-is it
a double standard?

16:38.519 --> 16:43.132
Yes, because I am now the one
that's gone all the time,

16:43.132 --> 16:45.613
and Chris is home more,

16:45.613 --> 16:48.572
but we're-we're making it work
'cause I still miss him.

16:48.572 --> 16:52.011
Charcuterie.
- Okay.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.491
How are you
and Robyn doing?

16:54.491 --> 16:56.058
- Um...
- Y'all have to get together

16:56.058 --> 16:58.147
and talk things out.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.496
I don't know.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.672
First word or phrase--
Robyn Dixon.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.675
Um, fraud.

17:04.675 --> 17:06.155
I don't know how I feel.

17:06.155 --> 17:07.548
- Okay.
- I-I mean,

17:07.548 --> 17:09.854
she sat by
while her friend, Gizelle,

17:09.854 --> 17:11.073
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.553
Told all these lies
about Chris.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.294
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.339
She went from,
"This is not the kind of
person you are, Chris,"

17:16.339 --> 17:18.472
to then humping the fence.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

17:18.472 --> 17:20.604
I don't want you to be
upset with people so long

17:20.604 --> 17:22.302
and hold it against them.

17:22.302 --> 17:24.434
Then, you know, you're
stressed out with it.

17:24.434 --> 17:27.350
Life usually will take care
of people, right?

17:27.350 --> 17:29.483
Yeah, well, I don't--
I don't plan to spend time

17:29.483 --> 17:31.093
thinking about it.
- Mm-hmm, right.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.877
But it is going
to be in my face

17:32.877 --> 17:36.794
because Karen invited everybody
to play pickleball.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.840
I'm probably gonna
see Robyn,

17:38.840 --> 17:44.063
and it's-it's not
gonna be normal.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.370
It's gonna be weird
because I don't believe

17:47.370 --> 17:49.198
the stories
that she's telling.

17:49.198 --> 17:52.245
I believe that she was
covering for Juan.

17:52.245 --> 17:55.552
But as a group, you all have
a conversation about that.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.946
That's what adults do when they
have issues with each other.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.557
Well, adults don't lie.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.211
Yes, they do.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.867
Coming up next...

18:05.867 --> 18:08.522
I want Wendy and Mia
to be on a team over here.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.132
- Ooh, look at that.
- Don't ask any questions.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.307
It's my event.
- Okay.

18:11.307 --> 18:13.614
- You in the middle.
- Oh, God, okay.

18:13.614 --> 18:16.834
You're on Gizelle
and Ashley's team.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.184
Great.

18:33.199 --> 18:36.289
Okay, pickleball time.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.987
We got our green
pickleball outfits on, huh?

18:38.987 --> 18:40.075
Yes.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.468
You are Mr. Pickle.
I'm Mrs. Pickle.

18:41.468 --> 18:43.165
You see, we came
to support pickles,

18:43.165 --> 18:45.689
and we have pickles
for every table.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.735
Okay, you got
your alcohol, plates.

18:47.735 --> 18:49.215
We're gonna need that,
right here,

18:49.215 --> 18:50.172
with the flow of food.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.696
Okay, we'll
make it flow.

18:52.696 --> 18:54.176
Yeah, make it flow.

18:55.264 --> 18:56.483
I just want you guys
to know the tone

18:56.483 --> 18:58.920
that I'm trying to set,
nothing but fun.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.836
Today is about bringing
the girls together,

19:01.836 --> 19:04.186
team spirit.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.232
Pickleball.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.364
I'm about to pickle.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.844
It's the green machines.
- Hey, girl.

19:09.844 --> 19:12.151
Oh, it's the green machines.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.326
- Yes.
- Hi.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.023
Well, pick-pickles
are green.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.067
Good to see you.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.025
Yes, we are pickle,
team pickle.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.505
- Okay.
- Team pickle, yeah.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.941
I get it. I get it.
I get it.

19:19.941 --> 19:21.116
- Yeah, pickle green. Yes.
- You get it all right?

19:21.116 --> 19:22.204
All right.
- I get it. Kal is on his way.

19:22.204 --> 19:23.510
So, he should be here.
- Oh, okay.

19:23.510 --> 19:24.815
Okay, good.
I'm enjoying you, by the way.

19:24.815 --> 19:26.513
- Oh, thanks.
- You're-you're a little fun.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.341
- I'm always fun, Karen.
- Since the new boyfriend.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.212
- Ooh, ooh.
- Since the new--

19:30.212 --> 19:32.432
I-I didn't say he was
my boyfriend, Karen.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.042
Oh, I'm helping you.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.522
Gizelle is spending
time on Gizelle.

19:35.522 --> 19:37.785
It's no shame in a woman
wanting to, you know,

19:37.785 --> 19:39.656
pick up a toy
every now and then,

19:39.656 --> 19:41.745
but I find it interesting.
I haven't seen him.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.834
I know pastor was
living in the phone.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.880
I just want you to
say hi to my friends.

19:45.880 --> 19:47.838
- all: Hi.
- Hi, Jamal.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.058
Jamal lives in your phone.
I know that.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.364
He lives
in my life. Yeah.

19:51.364 --> 19:52.234
I'm just saying I know
he live in the phone.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.889
- He does.
- He ain't here.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.717
But Jason's ass ain't
even in the phone.

19:56.717 --> 19:57.935
I ain't seen him.

19:57.935 --> 19:59.502
Where you at?
Outer space?

20:04.464 --> 20:07.249
- Hey, babe. Hi.
- Hey, honey, you ready?

20:07.249 --> 20:08.642
You ready to
pickle this ball?

20:08.642 --> 20:12.385
Yes, let's go get
the pickleball,

20:12.385 --> 20:14.909
the-the pickle-pickleball.
- Mm-hmm.

20:16.606 --> 20:19.479
- Hey, Mia.
- What we do, what we do.

20:19.479 --> 20:20.871
Okay, all white.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.873
- Raymond, how you doing, bro?
- All right, man.

20:22.873 --> 20:24.353
Good to see ya.

20:24.353 --> 20:25.528
- You look gorge.
- Hi, Mia.

20:25.528 --> 20:27.226
- Oh, oh, oh, sorry, we're not.
- Right.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.358
No, we're doing this,

20:29.358 --> 20:31.317
but we're getting
so much better.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.885
Hi, ladies.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.235
- Hi.
- Karen.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.845
Very nice to meet you guys.
- Shelby.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.150
So, listen.

20:39.150 --> 20:41.501
Now, we have
more girls coming,

20:41.501 --> 20:43.285
but if you wanna start with
some instruction, please do so.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.678
Sure.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.506
The most important rule
you guys need to know--

20:46.506 --> 20:48.290
this area is
called the kitchen.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.074
You never wanna be
inside the kitchen.

20:50.074 --> 20:51.598
- Okay.
- Let's get some paddles

20:51.598 --> 20:52.990
and let's just hit
and have fun.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.601
- Okay.
- Just remember
that important rule.

20:54.601 --> 20:55.558
That's it.
- No kitchen--

20:55.558 --> 20:57.430
stay out the kitchen.
- Yes.

20:57.430 --> 20:58.605
You guys ready?
White and black.

20:58.605 --> 20:59.997
White team against
the green team.

21:07.004 --> 21:08.441
- Okay.
- Wait a minute.

21:08.441 --> 21:09.833
- Do you wanna play?
- Hi.

21:09.833 --> 21:10.878
- What is happening?
- I'll host. Y'all warm up.

21:10.878 --> 21:13.315
Oh, gosh, she
ruins everything.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.925
- What is this?
- This is pickleball.

21:14.925 --> 21:16.100
Hey, how you doin'?
- Ray and I dressed

21:16.100 --> 21:17.188
in the theme of a pickle.
- How you doin'?

21:17.188 --> 21:17.885
- What's up, brother?
- I love it.

21:17.885 --> 21:19.539
- Okay.
- Hi.

21:19.539 --> 21:21.454
- Hi, gorge.
- Hi, beautiful.

21:21.454 --> 21:22.933
- How are you?
- Good. How you doin'?

21:22.933 --> 21:23.934
- Oh, my God. You good?
- Girl, you smell delicious.

21:23.934 --> 21:25.327
- Oh, thank you.
- Okay. Ray? Ray?

21:25.327 --> 21:27.111
Okay, whose
butt am I kicking?

21:27.111 --> 21:28.025
- Ray, let Vivian
have your play.
- That one.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.549
- This butt.
- Hey, Vivian.

21:29.549 --> 21:30.811
- Hi.
- How are you?

21:30.811 --> 21:32.639
- Hey, what's up? How you doin'?
- Hi, Ray.

21:32.639 --> 21:33.944
Oh, y'all are coordinating.
- Yes, absolutely.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.294
We-we are the pickles
at the pickleball.

21:37.383 --> 21:38.384
- That's how we go.
- My other half is not here.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.211
We thought this
was later today.

21:40.211 --> 21:41.169
- Oh.
- So, he has clients

21:41.169 --> 21:42.301
this morning.
- Oh, okay.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.650
- Okay, well, next time.
- Yeah, yes.

21:43.650 --> 21:44.607
- Next time.
- Yes, yes.

21:44.607 --> 21:45.521
- All right.
- Okay.

21:47.175 --> 21:48.307
- She looks great.
- Right.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.830
Yeah.

21:51.875 --> 21:53.790
Do I speak to Candiace?
No, I do not.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.924
Why? Um, just rewind
the videotape.

21:58.404 --> 22:01.015
You're dwindling uterus
was waiting for you

22:01.015 --> 22:02.538
to put it on TV.

22:02.538 --> 22:04.584
You sit up here with
your privileged,

22:04.584 --> 22:07.369
white-looking ass,
and you think you can say

22:07.369 --> 22:09.676
whatever the
you wanna say!

22:09.676 --> 22:12.766
There's no-- nothing good
will ever come

22:12.766 --> 22:14.768
from me speaking
to Candiace.

22:14.768 --> 22:17.336
Chris made me feel
completely uncomfortable.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.989
He's a sneaky link.

22:18.989 --> 22:21.949
Gizelle's choice words

22:21.949 --> 22:24.908
had a grave effect
on my marriage.

22:24.908 --> 22:27.476
So,
that bitch forever.

22:27.476 --> 22:30.044
Like,
her for-forever.

22:30.044 --> 22:32.263
- Hey!
- Hello, my yogis,

22:32.263 --> 22:33.526
my-my pupils.
- Hey.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.702
- Yes.
- How are you?

22:35.702 --> 22:37.399
- Good to see you.
- Nice to see you, too.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.575
This is Stuart.
- Thank you for organizing.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.403
- Absolutely.
- It's gonna be a blast.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.666
This is so much fun.

22:44.841 --> 22:46.495
Just getting
the engine revved up.

22:46.495 --> 22:49.324
Okay, don't get distracted.

22:49.324 --> 22:50.847
We're gonna play
a game in a minute.

22:50.847 --> 22:53.067
I just want you all to be
open to talking to each other.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.895
So, I'm gonna do a few
things today that would

22:54.895 --> 22:55.722
encourage communication.
- Okay.

22:55.722 --> 22:57.680
- Okay.
- Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

22:57.680 --> 22:59.682
I'm trying to keep
everybody at that line

22:59.682 --> 23:01.292
where you have
a conversation.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.556
But if it go left,
don't blame me.

23:03.556 --> 23:04.731
- Okay.
- Oh, is this an announcement?

23:04.731 --> 23:06.428
That was an
announcement, a PSA.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.516
What-what did they say?

23:07.516 --> 23:08.430
They said you didn't
speak to people.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.866
I didn't.
I mean, I just--

23:09.866 --> 23:12.826
'cause-'cause there was
an evil spirit in the way.

23:14.436 --> 23:15.872
Now that you've had
lessons, Eddie,

23:15.872 --> 23:17.091
you're gonna have to
roll with the men.

23:17.091 --> 23:18.788
Y'all-- the men gotta go.

23:18.788 --> 23:21.748
And I want Wendy and Mia
to be on a team over here.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.314
- Ooh, look at that.
- Don't ask any questions.

23:23.314 --> 23:24.838
It's my event.
- Okay.

23:24.838 --> 23:25.926
- Okay.
- You in the middle.

23:25.926 --> 23:27.406
Oh, God, okay.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.321
You're on Gizelle
and Ashley's team.

23:30.321 --> 23:32.062
I expect you guys
to enjoy yourself

23:32.062 --> 23:36.937
and find out that we all
can have fun together.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.721
- Okay.
- Great.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.941
- Hi, darling! Whoo!
- Hello, my dear.

23:40.941 --> 23:43.770
Thank you for inviting me.
- Thank you. Wait, wait, wait.

23:43.770 --> 23:44.423
- On this side? Okay.
- Yes.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.815
Come on, girl.

23:45.815 --> 23:50.080
The best way to foster
healthy relationships

23:50.080 --> 23:51.691
is to play together.

23:51.691 --> 23:53.214
I'm loving this fit.

23:53.214 --> 23:54.520
You know, we had to do
a little somethin'-somethin'.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.698
- Hey.
- Hey, how you doin'?

23:58.698 --> 24:00.874
Do we have a team name?

24:00.874 --> 24:02.484
Mia, do we have
a team name over here?

24:02.484 --> 24:03.833
We need one.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.182
Let's come up with one.
- Team, um, Finishers?

24:05.182 --> 24:06.749
I don't know.
- Punishers.

24:08.969 --> 24:13.016
I could play by myself,
but here we are.

24:13.016 --> 24:15.018
I'll do my best.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.807
♪ Can't stop us
no they can't stop us ♪

24:22.896 --> 24:26.203
♪ No they can't stop us
no they can't stop us ♪

24:27.074 --> 24:28.554
♪ Just know
they can't drop us ♪

24:35.648 --> 24:37.040
Oh, wait, wait.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.521
- Oh, my God.
- What's up, guys?

24:39.521 --> 24:42.089
♪0

24:52.055 --> 24:53.970
What's up, guys?

24:53.970 --> 24:55.929
Hi, guys.

24:57.713 --> 24:59.846
Is that Juan Dixon,

24:59.846 --> 25:00.803
player-player
from the Himalayas,

25:00.803 --> 25:02.718
coming over to-- what?

25:02.718 --> 25:03.980
They're going through
all this sh--,

25:03.980 --> 25:07.549
but they come in
like they've done nothing.

25:07.549 --> 25:10.900
I thought he would
be in Canada

25:10.900 --> 25:13.337
speaking French
or something.

25:13.337 --> 25:15.731
I'm glad he's here.
You know, why wouldn't he be?

25:15.731 --> 25:17.124
He doesn't have a job.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.647
It's either watch TV
or come to pickleball.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.257
Come to pickleball.

25:20.257 --> 25:21.824
Oh, my God.

25:21.824 --> 25:22.999
We-we're ready
for you to play.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.261
Okay.

25:24.261 --> 25:26.307
At the end of the day,
Juan is not my man.

25:26.307 --> 25:30.833
So, I have stated my case.
I'm done with it.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.749
- Hold on, everybody.
- All right.

25:33.749 --> 25:34.750
All right.
Okay, what's happening?

25:34.750 --> 25:35.969
- Hi, Robyn.
- What's up, baby?

25:35.969 --> 25:36.926
- Oh, I'm doin' good, man.
- How are you?

25:36.926 --> 25:38.188
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

25:38.188 --> 25:39.189
- How you doing?
- Hi.

25:39.189 --> 25:40.451
- How you doing?
- Good to see ya.

25:40.451 --> 25:42.453
- Robyn is-- hi, babe.
- Hey, how are you?

25:42.453 --> 25:44.586
- You look so cute.
- Thank you.

25:44.586 --> 25:45.892
- I love.
- Thank you.

25:45.892 --> 25:46.762
- Robyn, here's your paddle.
- Let me go speak

25:46.762 --> 25:48.068
to Nneka's husband.
- Yes.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.504
- Hi. I'm Robyn.
- Hey, how are you?

25:49.504 --> 25:50.549
Nice to meet you.
- What's your name?

25:50.549 --> 25:52.463
- Ikenna-- Ikenna.
- Ikenna.

25:52.463 --> 25:53.682
Nice to meet you.

25:53.682 --> 25:55.945
As I'm wracking my brain
to understand

25:55.945 --> 25:59.122
what Robyn's issue
is with me,

25:59.122 --> 26:01.951
I'm-I'm coming up
short every time.

26:06.434 --> 26:07.609
Come on, now.

26:07.609 --> 26:08.958
This lady has trashed
me and my husband.

26:08.958 --> 26:14.007
So, yeah, I ain't
talking to her.

26:14.921 --> 26:15.791
I'm gonna--
I'm gonna play now.

26:15.791 --> 26:17.140
Robyn is here.
- Okay.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.968
Okay, and, Robyn,
you're on that side.

26:18.968 --> 26:20.491
The only thing you're not
supposed to stay in--

26:20.491 --> 26:21.667
and those are the trainers.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.494
Don't go in the kitchen,
the orange box.

26:23.494 --> 26:24.495
Okay.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.062
Hey, girl.
- You look cute.

26:26.062 --> 26:28.151
- Thank you.
- Girl, this is--

26:28.151 --> 26:30.850
this is giving sexercise.
Sexercise-- I love it.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.155
You look wonderful.

26:32.155 --> 26:33.679
What the hell is Robyn
wearing at pickleball?

26:33.679 --> 26:35.594
You look like
a sheered Batman.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.726
See-through--
vagina on display.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.385
Oh, Lord, cut that.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.520
Oh, so, like, what's
the move, like, doubles?

26:49.520 --> 26:51.044
- Yeah.
- Oh, all right.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.306
They-they're making this up.
You know what I'm saying?

26:52.306 --> 26:53.655
Oh, they're doing
their own thing, huh?

26:53.655 --> 26:55.135
- Really.
- Eddie.

26:55.135 --> 26:56.571
- What's up?
- What's up, Eddie?

26:56.571 --> 26:57.920
- What's good with you, man?
- How you doing, man?

26:57.920 --> 26:59.226
How you been?
- I'm good, man. I'm good, man.

26:59.226 --> 27:00.357
How you been?
- Good seeing ya. I'm good, man.

27:00.357 --> 27:01.097
- Good to see you, too, man.
- Yeah.

27:01.097 --> 27:02.359
You ready for
some pickleball?

27:02.359 --> 27:03.578
I'm bringing
my competitive juices here.

27:03.578 --> 27:04.710
So, I'm just letting
you know, right now.

27:04.710 --> 27:05.232
All right, Gizelle.
Bring it home.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.146
We ready?

27:08.888 --> 27:11.804
- Come on, Gizzy. Yeah!
- Hit it.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.632
There you go.
- Ahh!

27:13.632 --> 27:16.199
Oh, they're gonna
kill each other.

27:19.072 --> 27:21.596
I thought for sure
I was gonna hit it.

27:21.596 --> 27:22.945
Nneka, this is my event.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.033
I'm gonna need you to lay back.
Lay-lay back.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.165
Keep the momentum going.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.166
I'm trying to follow
your lead, baby.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.995
I'm following
your lead, honey.

27:28.995 --> 27:30.997
- Here it comes.
- There you go.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.215
- Yes, Karen!
- Good job, Karen!

27:32.215 --> 27:33.608
It was in--
it was in the pink.

27:33.608 --> 27:34.957
It was in the pink.
- In, in, in!

27:34.957 --> 27:36.393
- Oh!
- Oh, in.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.265
In-- that was on the line.
That was on the line.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.701
That was on--
that's right, Karen.

27:39.701 --> 27:40.746
You better
work that thing.

27:40.746 --> 27:41.703
Work that thing.
- Show the people.

27:41.703 --> 27:42.573
- Give it to 'em.
- Yes, yes.

27:42.573 --> 27:43.531
- It was in.
- Yes.

27:43.531 --> 27:44.575
Here we go.
We got warm-ups.

27:44.575 --> 27:47.100
Oh, you're nice.
Uh-oh.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.971
- Oh, we're out here.
- Oh, he dropped it on me.

27:48.971 --> 27:49.972
We're out here.

27:49.972 --> 27:50.930
- Okay.
- It's out. All right.

27:50.930 --> 27:52.192
Come on, Iyke.
Get loose, Iyke.

27:52.192 --> 27:53.236
Old man-- old man
over here stretching.

27:53.236 --> 27:54.934
I know.
Hey, he better, though.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.196
I hurt my hamstring.
- Hey, guys.

27:56.196 --> 27:57.197
Hey, guys, it's the--
it's the hamstrings

27:57.197 --> 27:58.241
that'll get you.
- Yeah, exactly.

27:58.241 --> 27:59.503
The hamstrings
will get you, man.

27:59.503 --> 28:00.983
- Okay, here we go.
- Ready?

28:00.983 --> 28:02.898
I thought it was gonna be
couples against couples.

28:02.898 --> 28:03.856
- There you go.
- Yes, Mia.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.248
- Nice, Gizelle.
- Yes.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.555
- No, out, out, out.
- That's okay. That's okay.

28:10.906 --> 28:14.431
Step in for me, babe.
I gotta fry some beans.

28:14.431 --> 28:17.739
Fry some beans?

28:17.739 --> 28:18.914
We have stuff over here.
Let's go eat.

28:18.914 --> 28:20.220
You wanna go?
All right. Let's go eat.

28:20.220 --> 28:21.656
- Yes. Whoo.
- All right. Come on. Let's go.

28:21.656 --> 28:23.658
Go on, baby.
Hit the ball.

28:23.658 --> 28:24.833
Oh.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.748
Show 'em what your ball
is looking like.

28:28.707 --> 28:29.882
What we're gonna do,
is bless the food.

28:29.882 --> 28:32.623
I'm gonna have Mr. Pickle
and Mrs. Pickle

28:32.623 --> 28:34.060
lead us in prayer.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.714
Bless the food for
the nourishment of our bodies.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.804
For Christ's sake, amen.
- Amen.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.589
Okay.

28:41.589 --> 28:42.590
But that was, like,
right after you were

28:42.590 --> 28:43.722
about to leave.
- Okay, okay.

28:43.722 --> 28:44.940
Yeah, that's
when I started, in 2008.

28:44.940 --> 28:46.637
- Okay, all right.
- Yeah.

28:46.637 --> 28:49.466
Please do feel free to
open your pickle on your table,

28:49.466 --> 28:51.860
your jar of pickles.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.819
- Oh, hello, hello.
- Hey, girl, how are you?

28:53.819 --> 28:55.951
- Hey, great.
- Good to see you.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.170
You smell good.
- Hi, Robyn.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.737
Everyone, this is
my friend, Keiarna.

28:58.737 --> 28:59.694
Hi, guys.

28:59.694 --> 29:01.870
Yes.
Good to see you.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.045
I feel like
I know her face.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.786
I-I've met her from
just Baltimore,

29:04.786 --> 29:06.266
but I don't know.
It's a small world.

29:06.266 --> 29:07.397
Maybe-- uh-huh.

29:07.397 --> 29:08.747
You were in Baltimore
for a while.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.096
Maybe you met here there.
Oh, she has the med spa.

29:10.096 --> 29:13.273
Yes.

29:16.058 --> 29:17.320
Listen, guys.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.453
We really appreciate
the men that are here.

29:19.453 --> 29:21.672
And I also wanna take
this moment just very briefly

29:21.672 --> 29:22.978
to thank everyone
for coming.

29:22.978 --> 29:26.025
And-and to be honest with you,
every one of us

29:26.025 --> 29:27.156
are not in a good place.

29:27.156 --> 29:29.115
We're talking about
the women, okay?

29:29.115 --> 29:31.944
Robyn showed up.
- Stop saying my name.

29:31.944 --> 29:32.988
And that's a beautiful thing

29:32.988 --> 29:34.250
'cause she didn't have to
show up

29:34.250 --> 29:35.338
because we are not in
the best of places.

29:35.338 --> 29:36.426
What the hell?
Stop saying my name.

29:36.426 --> 29:37.471
So, that shows--
this is my event.

29:37.471 --> 29:38.472
I thought we were fine.

29:38.472 --> 29:40.909
We're gonna go
back to our game.

29:40.909 --> 29:41.867
All right.
Get the ball, Iyke.

29:41.867 --> 29:45.305
Get two.
Get two, Iyke, please.

29:45.305 --> 29:46.697
Hey, I'm not gonna sit here
and listen to that.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.744
This, I said, was the place
to get everybody

29:49.744 --> 29:51.702
up to the line
and have a good time.

29:51.702 --> 29:54.967
- A message between us got lost.
- It did. That's fair.

29:54.967 --> 29:57.012
- Okay.
- Nneka brought up

29:57.012 --> 29:59.058
that a conversation she and I
had had,

29:59.058 --> 30:01.103
and I delivered
the message wrong to you,

30:01.103 --> 30:03.236
and I told her that
I told you the wrong thing.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.454
And I appreciate that,
by the way.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.195
'Cause I was wrong,
what I said.

30:06.195 --> 30:09.285
So, are the two of you
good then?

30:13.420 --> 30:15.204
I don't know her
to have a problem with her.

30:15.204 --> 30:17.163
I don't know her, like,
to have a problem with her.

30:17.163 --> 30:18.555
- Right.
- Oh, didn't I just say that?

30:18.555 --> 30:19.861
Yes, yes.

30:19.861 --> 30:21.167
So, you're repeating
what I'm saying. Okay.

30:21.167 --> 30:22.168
No, I'm not repeating
what you're saying.

30:22.168 --> 30:23.343
I don't know you.
That's a fact.

30:23.343 --> 30:23.822
Yeah, I don't know you
to have a problem

30:23.822 --> 30:24.997
with you either.

30:24.997 --> 30:26.259
I don't--
I don't know her.

30:26.259 --> 30:27.042
But I did hear
you have a problem with me.

30:27.042 --> 30:28.783
So...
- What?

30:28.783 --> 30:30.480
So, how do I have a problem
with you

30:30.480 --> 30:32.178
when I don't know you?

30:32.178 --> 30:34.180
I'm aware of the phone call
that your mom made to my in-law

30:34.180 --> 30:36.312
saying that she submitted
my name to a shrine.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.193
I heard,
and I'm aware of the phone calls

30:47.193 --> 30:49.369
your sister made to my in-law

30:49.369 --> 30:51.632
about me being part of
this group.

30:51.632 --> 30:54.374
And I'm aware of the phone call
that your mom made to my in-law

30:54.374 --> 30:59.901
saying that she submitted
my name to a shrine

30:59.901 --> 31:01.642
and threatening to
send my in-law's name

31:01.642 --> 31:04.558
to a shrine.

31:04.558 --> 31:07.996
- My mom?
- Your mom said those things.

31:07.996 --> 31:09.780
Sweetie,
I've never called her.

31:09.780 --> 31:10.912
Because of what
you told her.

31:10.912 --> 31:12.914
What in-law?
Who is your in-law?

31:12.914 --> 31:14.002
Who is my in-law?

31:14.002 --> 31:14.742
Lebe is my in-law,
and you know her.

31:14.742 --> 31:16.352
I never called her.

31:16.352 --> 31:18.659
Your sister called Lebe,
and you were on the other line.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.008
Now, you're switching.
Now, you're switching it up.

31:20.008 --> 31:21.401
You just said I called her.
- What the hell?

31:21.401 --> 31:22.924
- I didn't call her.
- Your-- I said your sister.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.273
You and your sister
were on the phone.

31:24.273 --> 31:26.188
- You just said two minutes ago.
- Stop it.

31:26.188 --> 31:28.756
- She just said I called her.
- Let me clear that sh-- up.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.236
- So, clear it the up.
- Your sister--

31:30.236 --> 31:31.367
I'm clearing it up, bitch!

31:31.367 --> 31:32.716
What the
are you talking about?

31:32.716 --> 31:33.979
- Oh, wow, wow, wow, wow.
- Bitch? Bitch? Bitch?

31:33.979 --> 31:35.502
Don't be talking about--
don't be-- don't--

31:35.502 --> 31:36.590
bitch, don't be talking about--
clear it the up.

31:36.590 --> 31:38.026
I've been nothing
but nice to you,

31:38.026 --> 31:39.245
and you called me a bitch.
- I don't know you.

31:39.245 --> 31:40.768
It's fake.
- This is your----ing fault.

31:40.768 --> 31:41.812
This is not my fault.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.249
This is--
you----ed up the...

31:43.249 --> 31:44.903
You and your green ass
is gonna away from me, okay?

31:44.903 --> 31:47.557
No.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.081
I don't even know you.

31:49.081 --> 31:50.952
You know me enough to
have your mom threaten me, baby.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.519
Pull up the phone
records then.

31:52.519 --> 31:53.955
I have a screenshot
of the phone records.

31:53.955 --> 31:55.130
Pull up
the phone records.

31:55.130 --> 31:55.957
She called my in-law
on Good Friday.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.654
Happy Good Friday to that.

31:57.654 --> 31:59.569
- You sound so crazy.
- You sound crazy.

31:59.569 --> 32:01.180
She said the same thing
about me.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.877
- Yes.
- I'm crazy, too.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.009
- No, your family is crazy.
- Oh, and a birdbrain.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.488
You've been a hater
since day one.

32:05.488 --> 32:06.968
You've been a hater.
- Girl, bye.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.535
Hate on you for what?
- For everything.

32:08.535 --> 32:09.928
- You-you-you could never.
- For everything, baby.

32:09.928 --> 32:10.885
You could never.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.017
You could never,
my darling.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.192
- For everything, baby.
- Sit down.

32:13.192 --> 32:14.584
Wendy, sit down.
- For everything.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.586
You're hating on me
for everything.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.980
You came to
deliberately attack me.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.416
It failed.
- Girl, your mom called me.

32:20.416 --> 32:21.287
Your mom called my in-law--
my in-law-- excuse me.

32:21.287 --> 32:22.636
Oh, it failed.
It failed.

32:22.636 --> 32:24.116
Attack you for what?
Wendy, attack for what?

32:24.116 --> 32:25.856
- It's a flop. It's a flop.
- For what?

32:25.856 --> 32:27.597
It's a flop.
It's a flop.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.034
But what-what is it
that you have?

32:29.034 --> 32:30.600
- It's a flop.
- Put on a show, baby.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.167
Put on a show.
- It's a flop. It's a flop.

32:32.167 --> 32:33.429
Put on a show.

32:33.429 --> 32:34.474
You know exactly what it is.
- It's a flop.

32:34.474 --> 32:37.129
I don't even wanna
be like this.

32:37.129 --> 32:38.826
Right, right, right.

32:56.844 --> 33:00.239
Wendy is not responsible
for what her mother

33:00.239 --> 33:02.241
and her sister do.

33:02.241 --> 33:03.982
- Let's be very clear.
- But, so, Candiace,

33:03.982 --> 33:05.853
you're okay with that then.
- You are not responsible
for that.

33:05.853 --> 33:06.985
- But listen to this.
- No, I'm not saying
I'm okay with anything.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.029
- But then what?
- Candiace? Candiace?

33:08.029 --> 33:09.378
But you shouldn't hold her
to a standard

33:09.378 --> 33:11.032
because her mom or her sister
said something.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.295
- But listen.
- Let's be very clear.

33:13.295 --> 33:17.256
There was a conversation
had with her and Ashley

33:17.256 --> 33:19.040
about an article.
- Right.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.478
- That came up about being an--
- Ibo.

33:22.478 --> 33:25.264
A Ibo and this
thing about Osu.

33:25.264 --> 33:28.310
You saying the thing
about the shrine,

33:28.310 --> 33:30.399
that actually is false.
- Is known on her family.

33:30.399 --> 33:31.835
- But guess what?
- There's no honor--

33:31.835 --> 33:33.489
That incriminates her
because that speaks to

33:33.489 --> 33:36.318
that Osu article that
she brought to Ashley.

33:36.318 --> 33:39.365
I already told Wendy that
I miscommunicated

33:39.365 --> 33:41.106
the conversation
I had with Nneka,

33:41.106 --> 33:43.282
and the fact that
she introduces that, like,

33:43.282 --> 33:44.805
it just wasn't necessary.

33:44.805 --> 33:47.808
The whole notion of Osu
is that they are two deities.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.027
Keep trying to play detective.
Keep trying to play detective.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.202
Your mom said it.

33:50.202 --> 33:51.768
It's indicative of
what your mom said.

33:51.768 --> 33:52.987
That's what your mom said.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.032
So, she's incriminating
herself even more

33:54.032 --> 33:55.729
by saying that.
- Let me just--

33:55.729 --> 33:57.165
let me just sit my ass down and
relax because this is stupid.

33:57.165 --> 33:57.296
Because you were at
my child's first communion.

33:57.296 --> 33:58.558
Yes.

33:58.558 --> 33:59.124
And my mom worships
our Lord and Savior,

33:59.124 --> 34:00.386
Jesus Christ.

34:00.386 --> 34:03.476
- In Jesus' name, I pray.
- Amen.

34:03.476 --> 34:04.912
At day.

34:04.912 --> 34:06.696
By night, she's-she's
submitting names to shrines.

34:09.395 --> 34:12.006
Yes!
Okay, I'm sorry.

34:12.006 --> 34:14.356
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

34:14.356 --> 34:16.097
Mama Sue...

34:16.097 --> 34:19.187
I do not believe
is capable of praying

34:19.187 --> 34:21.363
to anything but God
because she prayed for me.

34:21.363 --> 34:24.018
I don't do witchcraft.
I don't do shrines.

34:24.018 --> 34:25.193
This is not my ministry.

34:25.193 --> 34:26.847
It's-it's not my portion.
I don't want it.

34:26.847 --> 34:29.328
I really believe it,
so I don't wanna talk about it.

34:29.328 --> 34:30.894
Yeah, I don't want her
to be mad at me

34:30.894 --> 34:32.418
and send me back.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.550
I don't care about what
this Nneka girl is saying,

34:34.550 --> 34:35.725
right now.

34:35.725 --> 34:38.380
The only shrine I know of
as a Catholic

34:38.380 --> 34:40.556
is the shrine
in downtown Baltimore.

34:40.556 --> 34:43.168
It's not negative.
It's not rooted in black magic.

34:43.168 --> 34:44.517
I feel like y'all
could work it out

34:44.517 --> 34:45.909
in a quiet situation.
No, like, go there.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.215
You know-- you know who
I wanna work it out with?

34:47.215 --> 34:48.434
Go there.

34:48.434 --> 34:50.088
Do you know who I wanna
work it out with?

34:50.088 --> 34:52.307
I wanna work it out with Mia.

34:55.049 --> 34:58.444
I didn't do it.

34:58.444 --> 34:59.271
- Gizelle?
- Lord have mercy.

34:59.271 --> 35:00.620
- Yes.
- Sorry, baby.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.361
Can I get some--
can I get some wine?

35:02.361 --> 35:03.753
Yes, come on.

35:03.753 --> 35:07.670
Okay, boys and girls,
this is Professor Osefo

35:07.670 --> 35:11.718
demonstrating
deflection 101.

35:11.718 --> 35:15.069
It's so obvious.
Like, we're not that dumb.

35:15.069 --> 35:16.375
We know what this is.

35:16.375 --> 35:19.726
Oh, I wanna talk to Mia?
Mia?

35:19.726 --> 35:23.251
Mia, okay, who you
called dumb and stupid.

35:23.251 --> 35:26.080
You wanna talk to her?
Oh, okay.

35:26.080 --> 35:28.822
- What the hell is going on?
- Girl, I don't know.

35:28.822 --> 35:31.781
This response-- right.

35:31.781 --> 35:33.609
So, that tells you
something is there.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.089
Yeah.

35:35.089 --> 35:36.873
Even though they--
she was acting like she never--

35:36.873 --> 35:38.875
she didn't know her
from a can of paint

35:38.875 --> 35:42.052
at your house,
and then it's, like, weird.

35:42.052 --> 35:44.490
She just got here and
she-she called me a bitch.

35:44.490 --> 35:46.535
I don't think me and you have--
well, I think we have.

35:46.535 --> 35:48.233
I think maybe we have.
Okay, okay.

35:48.233 --> 35:48.885
Maybe, yeah, no, well, Wendy,
you called me a lot of things.

35:48.885 --> 35:50.104
Okay, okay, okay.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.802
You're so----ing corny,
crater-face bitch!

35:52.802 --> 35:54.717
You are----ing trash.

35:54.717 --> 35:56.589
Talk about my little receipt
of you giving Peter the cookie,

35:56.589 --> 35:58.199
so you can get a little
restaurant in Bar One.

35:58.199 --> 35:59.722
You are----ing trash,
and I want you to--

35:59.722 --> 36:01.028
- Girl, uh-uh.
- Wanna talk about that?

36:01.028 --> 36:03.378
If someone, anybody,
hits even dumbass Mia,

36:03.378 --> 36:05.554
right now, in the face...

36:05.554 --> 36:07.774
- That's not nice.
- I would say, hold up.

36:07.774 --> 36:08.949
This is messed up.

36:08.949 --> 36:12.344
You're so slow.
Like, I vibrate so high.

36:12.344 --> 36:15.390
Okay, but, Mia, you done
thrown a drink in my face.

36:15.390 --> 36:16.696
I did, but we already
talked about that.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.001
Hold up. I just wanted
to have the conversation

36:18.001 --> 36:20.003
to know that we can coexist,
and we're good.

36:21.570 --> 36:24.094
Nneka is
telling the truth.

36:24.094 --> 36:25.792
I know that.

36:25.792 --> 36:28.142
I don't want the Nigerian
girls to be fighting.

36:28.142 --> 36:29.796
But that's-- but, Candiace,
let me tell you something.

36:29.796 --> 36:31.276
- You all are a small community.
- That's why it was shocking,

36:31.276 --> 36:32.451
because that's not--
- And you all should be

36:32.451 --> 36:33.452
coming together.
- This is not--

36:33.452 --> 36:34.496
that's not our
cultural thing.

36:34.496 --> 36:35.802
When-when her sister
was calling,

36:35.802 --> 36:37.630
the mama said,
"I have a shrine."

36:37.630 --> 36:40.154
- A shrine is voodoo.
- A shrine is like voodoo.

36:40.154 --> 36:41.895
I think that--

36:41.895 --> 36:42.591
- Oh!
- Oh!

36:43.679 --> 36:44.767
It's on fire!
It's on fire!

36:44.767 --> 36:45.942
- Oh, God.
- Oh, get-- baby, get it.

36:45.942 --> 36:48.075
- Okay.
- You gotta put the fire out.

36:48.075 --> 36:49.729
Hold up. Hold up.
Hold up.

36:49.729 --> 36:52.166
That's----ed up.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.646
It's still going, Karen.
Move!

36:53.646 --> 36:54.690
Hold on. You gotta
put wet on it.

36:54.690 --> 36:55.822
It's coming.
It's-it's moving.

36:55.822 --> 36:57.867
This is the demons
coming to get us.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.398
A shrine
is like voodoo.

37:06.398 --> 37:08.051
I think that--

37:08.051 --> 37:09.139
- Oh!
- Oh!

37:09.139 --> 37:10.532
Oh, it's on fire!
It's on fire!

37:10.532 --> 37:12.230
- Get it, baby, get it.
- Okay, hold on.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.361
Hold on. Hold on.
- No, not near me.

37:13.361 --> 37:14.797
Right here, right
here, right here.

37:14.797 --> 37:15.798
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.

37:15.798 --> 37:16.843
- No, it's not.
- Right here.

37:16.843 --> 37:17.583
There's a lot
of weave in here.

37:17.583 --> 37:18.714
We need to put
that thing out.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.368
This is the demons
coming to get us.

37:21.587 --> 37:23.850
Juan Dixon, come to me,
woman to woman.

37:23.850 --> 37:25.852
You got a problem with me?
- Hey.

37:25.852 --> 37:27.723
Did you set my
event on fire?

37:27.723 --> 37:29.159
- I'm sorry.
- Did you do that intentionally?

37:29.159 --> 37:30.683
Bring it in. Bring it in.
Bring it in. Come on.

37:30.683 --> 37:32.206
Bring it in. Bring it in.
Bring it in.

37:32.206 --> 37:33.207
All right, pound. Bring it in.
Bring it in. I'm sorry.

37:33.207 --> 37:34.600
- What happened?
- I'm so sorry.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.254
- He start-started a fire.
- It was a nice shot.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.472
Who?
Who started a fire?

37:37.472 --> 37:39.735
Who? Juan knocked
the food over

37:39.735 --> 37:41.563
and started a fire.
- No. Did he really?

37:41.563 --> 37:43.826
What the hell?
You're taking my ball.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.090
- You mad with me?
- You guys, no, I-- look.

37:47.090 --> 37:48.570
- You got a problem with me?
- You know--

37:48.570 --> 37:50.311
you know I'm not like that.
I wanted some beans, too.

37:50.311 --> 37:51.747
You--

37:51.747 --> 37:54.576
Juan Dixon is
a professional athlete.

37:54.576 --> 37:56.883
He can plant a ball
wherever he wants,

37:56.883 --> 37:59.277
but, no, you're gonna fall
your big ass into the fence

37:59.277 --> 38:02.018
and knock my food over
and set the carpet on fire.

38:03.629 --> 38:04.804
My bad, ladies.

38:04.804 --> 38:06.501
Y'all gotta
make it right.

38:06.501 --> 38:07.894
Y'all just stop
meeting each other.

38:07.894 --> 38:09.635
But can I tell you? I don't--
even right now,

38:09.635 --> 38:10.940
I still don't have
a problem with her.

38:10.940 --> 38:13.203
I was so nice to
her at Ashley's thing.

38:13.203 --> 38:14.640
I even gave her my number.

38:14.640 --> 38:16.076
- So, I just think--
- But she just came like this.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.557
Doo-doo-doo-doo-whoom.
- No, she-she came

38:18.557 --> 38:19.558
with her-- with her Glocks.
- But guess what?

38:19.558 --> 38:21.473
I got the mother----ing
bazooka.

38:21.473 --> 38:23.910
Come at me
the again.

38:23.910 --> 38:25.346
Oh, my God.

38:25.346 --> 38:26.434
Now, she has
a problem with you.

38:26.434 --> 38:27.696
And I'm okay
with that, too,

38:27.696 --> 38:28.871
because the problem started
from her family,

38:28.871 --> 38:30.264
not from anything I did.
- Right, right.

38:30.264 --> 38:31.874
Because if somebody
asked me,

38:31.874 --> 38:33.223
"Oh, do you know
this person?"

38:33.223 --> 38:34.355
I say, "I've met them,
but I don't know them,"

38:34.355 --> 38:35.574
is that a crime?

38:35.574 --> 38:37.140
Let me tell you
somethin'.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.838
Favor ain't fair,

38:38.838 --> 38:42.102
and because God has worked
overtime on me,

38:42.102 --> 38:45.540
don't be mad that he clocked out
for lunch on your ass.

38:45.540 --> 38:46.889
You understand what I'm saying?
- Not lunch, okay.

38:46.889 --> 38:49.196
- 'Cause favor ain't fair, okay?
- I have to go.

38:49.196 --> 38:50.632
I ain't--
- Hold on, Jesus.

38:50.632 --> 38:52.373
I need a water on that.

38:52.373 --> 38:54.810
Hold on.
I need a water.

38:54.810 --> 38:57.117
After her mom
called my in-law

38:57.117 --> 38:58.771
and said that she put
my name in a shrine,

38:58.771 --> 39:01.687
her husband unfollowed
my husband on Facebook

39:01.687 --> 39:03.123
the next day.
- But he was following him?

39:03.123 --> 39:04.690
'Cause they went
to college together.

39:04.690 --> 39:07.345
What?
So, they know each other?

39:07.345 --> 39:08.650
So, well, I think they know
of each other. Yes, for sure.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.043
Did they--
did they speak?

39:10.043 --> 39:11.653
I don't-- this-- it might be
the same fake sh--

39:11.653 --> 39:13.133
Wendy did to me
that her husband is doing, too.

39:13.133 --> 39:15.004
I don't know.
- Did you talk to Eddie?

39:15.004 --> 39:16.484
You didn't say hi?
- You didn't-- you didn't tell--

39:16.484 --> 39:17.790
I didn't know that
he and Eddie were friends.

39:17.790 --> 39:18.791
Oh, yeah, how was your
interaction with that?

39:18.791 --> 39:21.315
This is some--
I don't get it.

39:21.315 --> 39:23.709
You just don't randomly
follow people on Facebook,

39:23.709 --> 39:25.493
for heaven's sake.
You know what I mean?

39:25.493 --> 39:27.843
And if you actually have
to go and scroll

39:27.843 --> 39:29.889
and press unfollow
because something happened,

39:29.889 --> 39:31.847
y'all know each other, okay?

39:31.847 --> 39:34.110
You know him?
- I just met him.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.590
Like, where is Juan?
- Wait, she-she-she said

39:35.590 --> 39:37.026
y'all were following-- y'all
were friends on Facebook,

39:37.026 --> 39:38.724
and then, all of a sudden,
you unfollowed.

39:38.724 --> 39:40.073
- What the is Facebook?
- Can I ask you a question, Mia?

39:40.073 --> 39:41.335
- Did you unfollow him?
- I know a ton of people

39:41.335 --> 39:42.292
on Facebook.
- Mia, can I ask you a question?

39:42.292 --> 39:43.511
Hey, Juan!
Hold on. Hold on.

39:43.511 --> 39:45.426
Hey, Juan!
- What happened?

39:45.426 --> 39:46.601
Go ahead, baby.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.255
Now-now, they done
got Eddie activated.

39:48.255 --> 39:49.604
Go ahead, baby.

39:49.604 --> 39:50.866
That was, like, that
had escalated so quickly.

39:50.866 --> 39:52.390
I didn't even--
- Yes, no, it went--

39:52.390 --> 39:53.695
it went from zero to 5,000.

39:53.695 --> 39:55.305
Honestly, Wendy's been
wanting to get that up

39:55.305 --> 39:57.873
off her chest for a minute.
She-she was waiting for that.

39:57.873 --> 39:59.397
- Okay, sorry. I'm back.
- Okay.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.920
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.487
You just said he unfollowed
you on Facebook, correct?

40:02.487 --> 40:05.359
- Eddie, what's up with that?
- Oh, man, I missed somethin'.

40:05.359 --> 40:07.927
Who is on-- when did I
unfollow you on Facebook?

40:07.927 --> 40:09.581
What am I doing on Facebook
unfollowing you?

40:09.581 --> 40:10.886
That's-that's even-- that's
even somewhere else, right now.

40:10.886 --> 40:11.800
- You know what?
- Like, I mean,

40:11.800 --> 40:13.019
I don't understand.

40:13.019 --> 40:14.324
- No, no, no. No, no, no.
- No, no, I think

40:14.324 --> 40:15.456
that's a weird way to--
- Let me-- let me--

40:15.456 --> 40:16.675
let me address it.
Let me address it.

40:16.675 --> 40:17.893
No, I just met--

40:17.893 --> 40:19.025
you just introduced me, right?
- Let me address it.

40:19.025 --> 40:20.069
Let me address it.
Let me address it.

40:20.069 --> 40:20.766
You just
introduced me, right?

40:20.766 --> 40:22.202
Let me address it.

40:22.202 --> 40:23.333
I'll take care of it.
- I just met you here today.

40:23.333 --> 40:24.639
Are you saying we were
never friends on Facebook?

40:24.639 --> 40:25.945
- After-after her mom called--
- I-I never--

40:25.945 --> 40:27.642
- After her mom--
- Wait, stop. Baby, stop it.

40:27.642 --> 40:29.601
Let me hear him answer
the question, please.

40:29.601 --> 40:30.732
- I'm gonna tell--
- Are you saying we were never

40:30.732 --> 40:32.038
friends on Facebook, bro?

40:32.038 --> 40:34.823
First of all,
I just met you here today.

40:34.823 --> 40:36.129
Okay, so,
you don't know me.

40:36.129 --> 40:37.739
Say it. Say it.
- I just met you here today.

40:37.739 --> 40:39.001
No, you gotta say it
with your chest.

40:39.001 --> 40:40.263
You don't know me, right, bro?
- It's okay.

40:40.263 --> 40:41.569
Look, don't get in
my man's face, honey.

40:41.569 --> 40:42.614
Just back up. Let the--
let the men be men.

40:42.614 --> 40:44.093
Bro-bro-bro-bro,
we're bros, bro.

40:44.093 --> 40:45.486
They allow us to be--
We're not gonna do this.

40:45.486 --> 40:47.009
Iyke done turned
into Ike Turner.

40:47.009 --> 40:48.663
You wanna fight
over Facebook?

40:48.663 --> 40:49.969
Facebook!

40:49.969 --> 40:52.362
If somebody doesn't
remember you,

40:52.362 --> 40:54.713
then you're just
not memorable.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.236
It's all good. She's-she's
looking for her moment.

40:56.236 --> 40:57.324
I'm not looking for anything.

40:57.324 --> 40:58.412
I'm just saying--
- Just talk, guys.

40:58.412 --> 40:59.674
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I don't need that.

40:59.674 --> 41:00.545
They're trying to
get a moment from you.

41:00.545 --> 41:01.676
Don't-don't let them
get it from you.

41:01.676 --> 41:03.025
I'm just learning
people's names.

41:03.025 --> 41:04.505
- But it's not cool, you know?
- No, it's not.

41:04.505 --> 41:05.158
They're trying to say
we're liars and everything.

41:05.158 --> 41:06.464
It's okay.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.509
Eddie reminds me of the guy
from "Get Out."

41:08.509 --> 41:10.380
Seems like he's
looking for freedom.

41:12.992 --> 41:17.126
Can we do a "Get Out Part 2"
and, like, free Eddie?

41:17.126 --> 41:18.650
My husband is not ready
to fight you over Facebook.

41:18.650 --> 41:20.303
Over Facebook-- we're about
to fight over Facebook?

41:20.303 --> 41:21.566
No, no.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.045
- We're not about to fight.
- No, we're not.

41:23.045 --> 41:24.264
It's absurd.

41:24.264 --> 41:25.526
You brought it up,
but now it's absurd?

41:25.526 --> 41:26.788
Your mom did it,
so now you're absurd.

41:26.788 --> 41:28.660
No, your mama.
Say my mama's name again.

41:28.660 --> 41:30.183
Your mama!
- Oh, my...

41:30.183 --> 41:32.011
Your mom is a witch.

41:34.143 --> 41:35.493
What is happening
over here, bro?

41:35.493 --> 41:37.669
I don't know, man.

41:37.669 --> 41:39.627
Eddie does not want
that smoke.

41:39.627 --> 41:40.889
Whoa.
- This is gonna be fun.

41:40.889 --> 41:44.197
I hope that y'all
can have a conversation.

41:44.197 --> 41:45.328
I'm pissed.

41:45.328 --> 41:46.373
Stop talking about it, now.
Stop it.

41:46.373 --> 41:47.766
All right. I'm done.

41:47.766 --> 41:49.985
Mr.--- Mr. and Mrs. Pickle,
are we-- are we--

41:49.985 --> 41:51.465
are we playing,
or are we going? What's next?

41:51.465 --> 41:53.554
- Oh, oh, we're done playing.
- We're done? All right.

41:53.554 --> 41:55.513
Let's go.
- Welcome to the circus.

42:03.869 --> 42:06.524
Next time, on
"The Real Housewives
of Potomac."

42:06.524 --> 42:07.437
We've been trying
to conceive

42:07.437 --> 42:08.700
for the past
seven months.

42:08.700 --> 42:10.571
We gotta do it more
regularly, you know.

42:10.571 --> 42:12.051
We know how.
- Stop talking.

42:12.051 --> 42:13.835
All right.

42:13.835 --> 42:14.923
Where are we goin'?

42:14.923 --> 42:18.797
Austin!

42:18.797 --> 42:20.668
I bring
all of the thongs.

42:20.668 --> 42:21.843
♪ Thong thong thong
thong thong ♪

42:21.843 --> 42:23.976
Are you wearing a thong?

42:23.976 --> 42:25.847
Turning me
into a----ing villain.

42:25.847 --> 42:28.763
I didn't do sh--
to none of y'all.

42:28.763 --> 42:29.808
Kiss my----ing ass.

42:29.808 --> 42:31.418
Okay, walk away,
so I can see it!

42:31.418 --> 42:33.202
- You don't
- ing own me!
