03:51.927 --> 03:55.317
All Chinese but Wu stay put! 

03:57.367 --> 04:00.757
Wu! Wait a minute, Wu!
I will fucking drop you!

04:01.047 --> 04:02.958
Wu, get with me here!

04:03.527 --> 04:05.597
...exactly because of this bullshit!

04:06.967 --> 04:10.403
...or I'll blow your tall Chinese head off!
Hey, Davey, open the door!

04:13.527 --> 04:14.880
Thank you.

04:39.327 --> 04:41.522
Wu's reappeared, Mr Tolliver.

04:42.007 --> 04:44.157
His and Lee's Chinks went at it.

04:44.247 --> 04:46.317
Looks like one dead apiece.

04:47.407 --> 04:50.001
Where's the fuck did Wu reappear?

04:50.287 --> 04:53.165
It seems to me like
he just fucking materialised.

04:53.247 --> 04:56.284
From the clouds,
or in some type of conveyance?

04:56.487 --> 04:58.478
Make me choose, I'll pick the clouds.

04:58.567 --> 05:02.276
One minute, he ain't by his sty.
Next glance, there he is.

05:02.367 --> 05:05.359
Then one man's dead by axe.
Lee's man.

05:05.807 --> 05:07.035
One by bullet.

05:07.127 --> 05:08.845
- Wu's.
- From Lee's pistol.

05:08.927 --> 05:12.283
Then Wu and Lee are coming
after each other like stags...

05:12.367 --> 05:15.404
until Burns drags Wu into the Gem.

05:15.487 --> 05:17.045
Drags Wu into the Gem?

05:17.127 --> 05:20.244
Burns does, yes, sir,
pointing his pistol at Lee.

05:21.167 --> 05:24.000
Could Wu have issued from the Gem,
as well?

05:24.087 --> 05:26.078
I wouldn't say he didn't.

05:29.327 --> 05:32.125
Larson, that I got the dollar in with...

05:32.287 --> 05:35.438
says he just brought George Hearst
to the camp, sir.

05:39.207 --> 05:40.526
Some as don't know better...

05:40.607 --> 05:43.440
might mistake me
for being on the outside looking in.

05:43.527 --> 05:45.643
Then you got your idle snatch
reading scripture...

05:45.727 --> 05:47.877
and know there's still hope.

05:49.287 --> 05:51.596
- Con Stapleton.
- Yes, sir?

05:52.007 --> 05:53.725
Situate yourself at the Grand Central...

05:53.807 --> 05:57.117
and tell me what fucking Wolcott's
doing and who he's doing it with.

05:57.207 --> 05:58.765
Yes, sir, Mr T.

05:59.927 --> 06:01.883
Can the bison spare you?

06:03.647 --> 06:07.117
Something strikes me
fucking melancholy about that creature.

06:08.687 --> 06:10.518
One more fucking day!

06:11.287 --> 06:13.437
That's all he had to control himself...

06:13.527 --> 06:16.803
and I could have put him
in fucking business.

06:17.167 --> 06:19.886
- Swearengen-
- Shut the fuck up, Wu!

06:19.967 --> 06:21.958
At least he has an excuse.
He's a Chink.

06:22.047 --> 06:24.356
Who knows
what the tribal requirements are.

06:24.447 --> 06:26.881
Maybe you don't act for a week...

06:27.047 --> 06:30.676
maybe they exclude you
from fucking dominoes or the like.

06:30.767 --> 06:31.995
But you!

06:33.047 --> 06:35.197
Tipping our fucking business.

06:35.287 --> 06:36.606
I'm sorry, Al.

06:36.687 --> 06:39.759
You hold one Chink off at gunpoint,
bring him the fuck up here.

06:39.847 --> 06:40.882
I'm sorry.

06:40.967 --> 06:45.006
I'm so fucking pleased I trusted you,
Johnny, to go out and buy meat.

06:45.247 --> 06:47.283
Get out of my fucking way!

06:48.287 --> 06:50.562
Tell Hearst I want to see him.

06:50.927 --> 06:54.681
My only reluctance, Al,
I have had such an onset of diarrhoea.

06:59.407 --> 07:03.559
- E.B.
- If the conversation's brief...

07:03.727 --> 07:06.161
I'm absolutely equal to the task.

07:07.367 --> 07:09.881
What shall I invoke as your reason?

07:09.967 --> 07:11.923
How about the fucking truth?

07:12.007 --> 07:16.478
The Chink that attacked his Chink
has been captured by my employee.

07:16.567 --> 07:18.956
If it would please Mr Hearst,
I'd like a word with him...

07:19.047 --> 07:21.402
before I decide what to do
with the Chink in my custody.

07:21.487 --> 07:22.556
But you'd like it here?

07:22.647 --> 07:24.558
Don't you be setting fucking terms, E.B.

07:24.647 --> 07:27.320
He's got reason enough
to want the look around.

07:27.407 --> 07:28.726
Fine, then.

07:30.527 --> 07:33.087
Go lock him up
somewhere in the whores' quarters.

07:33.167 --> 07:35.123
You might think to put
a fucking guard on him...

07:35.207 --> 07:38.279
that ain't asleep,
you incompetent fucks.

07:42.247 --> 07:45.762
- It wasn't my watch he escaped on, Al.
- Go away, Johnny.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.479
I was 10:00 to 4:00.

07:48.607 --> 07:51.041
Shut the fucking door!

07:59.527 --> 08:01.245
Would you still be willing, Mr Bullock...

08:01.327 --> 08:03.921
to see me take up the teaching
of the camp's children?

08:04.007 --> 08:06.316
I would, yes. I'd be delighted.

08:10.447 --> 08:11.766
Delighted.

08:16.367 --> 08:19.439
I don't want to lose him,
but I wouldn't upset them, either.

08:20.287 --> 08:21.436
I see.

08:22.087 --> 08:24.965
They're daunted enough
by schooling itself.

08:25.247 --> 08:26.475
Oh, yes.

08:29.807 --> 08:33.356
I am speaking of wearing mourning
until the year has passed.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.957
But I believe...

08:38.047 --> 08:41.676
if I teach them with love and joy...

08:42.567 --> 08:44.842
then I won't make them afraid.

08:48.607 --> 08:50.802
And I don't want to lose him.

08:52.287 --> 08:54.164
You'll never lose him.

09:09.407 --> 09:11.398
Are we done with our buying, Francis?

09:11.487 --> 09:13.523
All but one of the important finds.

09:13.607 --> 09:16.997
I have 40 stamps and a millwright
coming in from the Ophir.

09:17.087 --> 09:20.045
I have the mill sited,
the ground tiled and levelled.

09:20.127 --> 09:23.403
The Garret find we don't yet own
is not placed to obstruct operations.

09:23.487 --> 09:24.966
I want it bought.

09:25.047 --> 09:27.607
I believe its title will be contested
in coming months.

09:27.687 --> 09:29.723
To act now would buy the contest
and not the find.

09:29.807 --> 09:32.526
All this fiddle fucking around
is tactical back-and-forth.

09:32.607 --> 09:34.120
We're up and running, Mr Hearst.

09:34.207 --> 09:37.677
With the millwright and double shifts,
we should be full bore inside the week.

09:37.767 --> 09:40.964
Getting it out of the ground,
that's what I love.

09:42.887 --> 09:45.401
Thank you for handling
the acquisitions, Francis.

09:46.927 --> 09:48.997
Excuse me, Mr Hearst.

09:50.647 --> 09:53.639
Might I escort you...

09:53.727 --> 09:57.640
across the thoroughfare
to meet a local luminary?

09:58.007 --> 09:59.998
Will you be joining me
at the operation this morning?

10:00.087 --> 10:01.725
No. I may this afternoon.

10:01.807 --> 10:03.843
This morning I'm conceding to my back.

10:09.167 --> 10:12.443
Fellow looks like
he stepped out of a specimen box.

10:14.367 --> 10:18.645
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Forgive me for interrupting your repast.

10:18.967 --> 10:21.959
I'm E.B. Farnum, mayor and hotelier.

10:22.927 --> 10:25.316
And I know you are George Hearst.

10:27.087 --> 10:28.202
Yes?

10:28.727 --> 10:31.400
Allow me a moment's silence,
Mr Hearst.

10:31.687 --> 10:35.316
Sir, I am having a digestive crisis...

10:35.607 --> 10:38.565
and must focus on
suppressing its expression.

10:40.847 --> 10:43.520
What's next?
Pink fucking panties or something?

10:43.607 --> 10:47.361
Jesus Christ! Jesus Christ!
I can't fucking do it.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.324
And I'll have a look
at one of those pans.

10:49.407 --> 10:52.160
Not now.
Tomorrow, I'll make you a price.

10:52.247 --> 10:55.080
This is the prospective groom
for today's prospective wedding...

10:55.167 --> 10:57.681
and I'm going to wait on him now
in privacy.

11:01.967 --> 11:03.400
Oh...

11:03.487 --> 11:07.765
Surprised you have any trade left,
often as I clear the joint.

11:10.047 --> 11:11.719
What can't you do?

11:11.847 --> 11:13.838
Any of it! It feels like.

11:14.247 --> 11:17.603
These fucking mittens in particular.

11:19.247 --> 11:22.125
"Traditional," the fucking tailor says.

11:22.207 --> 11:24.562
Well, not in my experience, they ain't.

11:24.647 --> 11:26.956
And if I was to imagine
where they might be...

11:27.047 --> 11:30.642
amongst males about to marry
ain't what comes to my mind.

11:30.887 --> 11:32.923
Look at these cocksuckers!

11:33.007 --> 11:34.326
Lavender.

11:34.807 --> 11:38.925
"The rigour in New York City,"
whatever the fuck that means.

11:39.007 --> 11:41.475
Have you brought up not wearing them?

11:41.567 --> 11:43.717
What if they're her idea?

11:43.967 --> 11:47.084
That's liable to bring the dromedary
to its knees.

11:48.767 --> 11:51.156
Christ! I'm in mortal misery.

11:51.247 --> 11:55.638
Anyways, today's the day.

12:04.447 --> 12:06.597
Going to the wedding, Davey?

12:07.207 --> 12:09.596
Not hardly, Mr Swearengen.
Wasn't invited.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.678
I was, not that I'm going.

12:11.767 --> 12:15.362
Vicious rumours I was responsible
for her first husband's death.

12:15.447 --> 12:18.007
Fucking woman invites me
to her wedding.

12:18.087 --> 12:20.760
Guess it's no accounting
for why people do things.

12:20.847 --> 12:24.601
Congregation says amen, Davey.

12:25.607 --> 12:27.962
- Consider the Chinaman.
- Wu?

12:29.127 --> 12:32.324
Forsakes safety and even odds
in a future fight...

12:32.407 --> 12:34.602
for immediate fucking dubious combat.

12:34.687 --> 12:38.726
Here again,
what gets into people's heads?

12:39.367 --> 12:41.437
The congregation says amen.

12:42.407 --> 12:44.716
- What?
- Nothing. I was being funny.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.924
No, no, no.
Don't be fucking funny with me, Davey.

12:48.807 --> 12:51.367
I didn't mean to interrupt
your train of thought.

12:51.887 --> 12:53.843
- What?
- Nothing, sir.

12:57.127 --> 13:01.040
Did you loose that Chinaman
to fuck up my fucking plans?

13:02.687 --> 13:03.802
Don't lie to me, Davey...

13:03.887 --> 13:06.401
or that breath you're holding
is the last you draw.

13:06.487 --> 13:08.682
- Can I speak?
- Go ahead.

13:08.767 --> 13:10.485
I need to breathe.

13:11.967 --> 13:13.685
Go take a breath.

13:14.287 --> 13:17.040
I fucking fell asleep, sir, on my
fucking watch over the Chinaman.

13:17.127 --> 13:18.640
He didn't pay you to let him go?

13:18.727 --> 13:20.797
No, I fell off to sleep
from the holding of the three jobs.

13:20.887 --> 13:24.084
- He told me he paid you.
- Then he's a lying fucking bastard!

13:31.327 --> 13:34.046
- Don't fall asleep, Davey.
- No, sir.

13:34.127 --> 13:38.325
- Quit a job before you fall asleep on it.
- Yes, sir.

13:38.647 --> 13:42.242
- There he is. That's Mr Swearengen.
- Yes, I see.

13:42.327 --> 13:44.522
Now I call this
the impressive contingent.

13:44.607 --> 13:46.598
- Would you be Mr Hearst?
- Yes, sir.

13:46.687 --> 13:49.884
- Al Swearengen. How do you do?
- Pleasure to meet you, Mr Swearengen.

13:49.967 --> 13:52.686
I'll suggest we adjourn to my quarters.

13:54.087 --> 13:56.123
- Your kill, sir?
- Who?

13:56.567 --> 13:57.886
The animal.

13:57.967 --> 14:01.084
Oh, no. Fuck, no.
I'm a fucking terrible shot.

14:01.287 --> 14:03.357
Work better closer in.

14:05.727 --> 14:09.242
I'll stay below, gentlemen,
unless you wish me up above.

14:10.127 --> 14:13.403
- Hurt back?
- Just a little achy today.

14:13.767 --> 14:16.645
Declining years spare us
no fucking indignities.

14:16.727 --> 14:20.242
My latest blessing's a horse apple
up my fucking asshole.

14:20.327 --> 14:22.716
Half my waking hours are spent
trying to pass water.

14:22.807 --> 14:27.164
Dan, bring that Celestial to my office.
I want to show him to Mr Hearst.

14:31.927 --> 14:33.963
Very auspicious beginning.

14:35.967 --> 14:38.720
I'd think
with these balcony doors open...

14:38.807 --> 14:41.480
you'd get a little cross draught
in the summer.

14:41.567 --> 14:42.636
I do, indeed.

14:42.727 --> 14:45.161
I've spent the last summers in Mexico.

14:45.247 --> 14:47.124
That fucking heat must be oppressive.

14:47.207 --> 14:50.279
- Nevada's was drier, I'd expect.
- Have you been there?

14:50.367 --> 14:54.246
My inferno was Australia.
Waste of two years, that was.

14:55.087 --> 14:56.440
Yeah, come in.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.878
Here we are. This yellow monkey's Wu.

15:00.967 --> 15:03.845
Older fella.
Not often you can tell how old they are.

15:03.927 --> 15:06.361
Done a turn or two for me, Wu has.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.756
And well liked enough among his own.

15:08.847 --> 15:11.202
His display against your Chink...

15:11.287 --> 15:13.801
was my first fucking inkling
that he's irrational.

15:13.887 --> 15:17.641
Mr Lee, the man he tried to kill, has
worked well for me in several camps.

15:17.727 --> 15:19.957
Then God bless Lee,
and off with fucking Wu's head.

15:20.047 --> 15:23.642
You've got your finger on the cause of it,
too, your Chink being forward-looking.

15:23.727 --> 15:25.797
"Set the bodies ablaze,
on with the day's trade. "

15:25.887 --> 15:28.447
- This one, being longer in the tooth-
- Set what bodies ablaze?

15:28.527 --> 15:30.677
Custom holds stronger
than what passes for his mind.

15:30.767 --> 15:33.884
- What bodies, Mr Swearengen?
- The whores for your workers.

15:33.967 --> 15:37.880
Not only does burning the corpses
save cargo space...

15:37.967 --> 15:41.039
far as the transporting of their bones
back to the homeland...

15:41.127 --> 15:45.120
which, as I gather, they hold as their
big fucking chance at the afterlife.

15:45.207 --> 15:48.244
What a tremendous tactic,
terrifying the unburned here.

15:48.327 --> 15:50.238
Do you know prospecting,
Mr Swearengen?

15:50.327 --> 15:51.919
Fucking nothing of it.

15:52.007 --> 15:54.157
And the securing of the colour,
once found?

15:54.247 --> 15:57.239
- Not a fucking thing.
- All I really care about.

15:57.327 --> 15:59.522
I fucking hope so.
I'd hate to think you're this good...

15:59.607 --> 16:01.518
at something that's only
a fucking hobby.

16:01.607 --> 16:05.202
Most often, my finds are in wild places,
which I prefer.

16:05.727 --> 16:08.036
When that is not so...

16:08.367 --> 16:11.040
I want friendly relations
with my predecessors...

16:11.127 --> 16:15.439
so that I can
secure the colour undistracted.

16:17.407 --> 16:18.965
Concentration, see?

16:19.047 --> 16:22.084
I suspect that's a key
with you hugely successful types.

16:22.167 --> 16:26.843
If others can provide here,
with less disruption to the camp...

16:27.167 --> 16:31.718
services Lee provided me elsewhere,
I'd have no objection to using them.

16:33.087 --> 16:34.964
Labour being the fucking essential?

16:35.047 --> 16:36.878
Towards securing the colour.

16:36.967 --> 16:40.437
This is the camp's original Chink.
All subsequent Chinks were his imports.

16:40.527 --> 16:42.279
Wu will staff your mines.

16:42.367 --> 16:45.916
And those that survive the explosions,
he can place in laundries or kitchens.

16:46.007 --> 16:49.124
- Can he understand us?
- Oh, very little English.

16:49.567 --> 16:52.684
No. No words we've employed so far.
Say "cocksucker," Wu.

16:52.767 --> 16:54.166
Cocksucker.

16:54.487 --> 16:57.604
That, San Francisco and Swearengen,
that's all I've heard him use.

16:57.687 --> 16:58.881
- Swearengen-
- Shut up.

16:58.967 --> 17:00.798
Now, as to your man and mine...

17:00.887 --> 17:05.165
I would need some demonstration
before making my final choice.

17:05.247 --> 17:07.282
So your man would have to prove out.

17:07.367 --> 17:10.598
That's a fucking mining term. Now,
that's a fucking expression I've heard.

17:10.686 --> 17:13.440
And you understand
its import and context?

17:14.127 --> 17:15.445
Yes, sir.

17:15.527 --> 17:17.722
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr Swearengen.

17:17.807 --> 17:20.401
Honour and a pleasure meeting you,
Mr Hearst.

17:28.446 --> 17:31.678
Kill a rooster, Wu,
and offer him up in sacrifice.

17:31.807 --> 17:36.244
Then start honing your weapons
for tonight's demonstration.

17:36.967 --> 17:41.324
Stick me one more fucking time, Jewel,
I'll drop you in a pool of fucking blood.

17:41.407 --> 17:43.841
Well, you just can't stand still.

17:44.207 --> 17:47.199
I'm moving
trying to defend my fucking self.

17:52.087 --> 17:54.726
He's getting what he asked for, anyway.

17:57.967 --> 17:59.639
Loony fucking Jew.

18:02.047 --> 18:03.400
Wear this.

18:06.167 --> 18:08.556
Devious fucking cripple, you are.

18:11.327 --> 18:15.115
How'd you pay that time then,
for the gun I sent you to buy?

18:16.087 --> 18:17.964
Sold a piece of pussy.

18:24.687 --> 18:28.965
How may I serve you further, Mr Hearst,
be the fashion great or mean?

18:29.047 --> 18:32.801
Make a price on your hotel.
Mr Wolcott says you avoid it.

18:32.887 --> 18:37.483
May I quibble with "avoid," sir,
as inexactly fitting the case?

18:39.487 --> 18:41.398
Not all- Get over!

18:42.687 --> 18:47.477
Not all not-makings-of-a-price are
avoidances necessarily, would you say?

18:48.167 --> 18:49.919
What will you take?

18:50.247 --> 18:52.522
Get away from me, God damn you!

18:55.287 --> 18:56.436
Forgive me.

18:57.567 --> 19:00.035
Excuse me. I am mad.

19:00.367 --> 19:03.564
My hotel is also my hospital.
I am my own warden.

19:04.767 --> 19:09.682
I mustn't sell, lest I then wander the
thoroughfare gibbering like a simian...

19:10.967 --> 19:13.435
brandishing my privates in my fist.

19:15.007 --> 19:18.522
Will you take $100,000
if I let you stay on as manager?

19:18.687 --> 19:20.962
Yes, sir. I must, of course.

19:21.567 --> 19:24.718
- I'll have it sent over later.
- Well, where am I?

19:27.007 --> 19:28.759
Why am I on my ass?

19:30.847 --> 19:34.044
May I say to you
that the week since our meeting...

19:34.127 --> 19:37.961
has seen me conduct with Yankton
an active telegraphic correspondence...

19:38.047 --> 19:41.801
which on every count has ameliorated
the terms of the proposal before you...

19:41.887 --> 19:43.400
in favour of the Deadwood camp?

19:43.487 --> 19:45.398
You smell like cat piss.

19:45.487 --> 19:49.799
I have worked so hard and diligently
for you, Mr Swearengen...

19:49.887 --> 19:51.479
that well may be the case.

19:51.567 --> 19:55.162
Regardless of the outcome,
I am proud of that advocacy.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.636
You having said that,
you liable to say more?

19:57.727 --> 20:00.366
Let the document now speak for itself.

20:00.887 --> 20:04.084
The letters may get larger,
the numbers will not.

20:07.647 --> 20:09.000
Forgive me.

20:09.167 --> 20:12.637
Long hours,
giddy at the smell of the barn.

20:14.007 --> 20:15.645
Stoic composure.

20:19.207 --> 20:21.437
The next sound you hear
will be that of your own voice.

20:21.527 --> 20:24.360
Get the fuck out of here. You'll know
when I've come to an answer.

20:24.447 --> 20:27.757
I must tell you
I require a response within the hour.

20:29.887 --> 20:32.196
Or as soon as humanly possible.

20:39.767 --> 20:42.679
Clam on a half shell
looking goddamned fool!

20:43.567 --> 20:46.161
I'm embarrassed to say I know you!

20:46.247 --> 20:49.956
Supposed intelligent woman
holding with rank superstition.

20:50.047 --> 20:53.517
The same clothes worn to nuptials
the week of a memorial...

20:53.607 --> 20:56.041
curse bride and groom forever.

20:57.727 --> 20:59.240
Shut up, Mose!

20:59.327 --> 21:01.238
He asked for work here.

21:01.567 --> 21:04.365
- As what?
- Watchman is what he suggested.

21:04.807 --> 21:07.640
We're a vacant structure,
in case he ain't fucking noticed.

21:07.727 --> 21:10.082
I think he shrinks from leaving.

21:10.807 --> 21:13.401
And the word for that is "malingering. "

21:14.447 --> 21:15.596
Here.

21:16.327 --> 21:18.557
- I will not.
- You will.

21:20.247 --> 21:23.876
- Is that part of the superstition?
- Undergarments? Yes.

21:24.407 --> 21:28.366
Over privates, in layers,
or bride and groom are doomed.

21:30.687 --> 21:33.520
Hearst is at that claim...

21:33.607 --> 21:36.440
mid-thoroughfare, the one you bought
from Marvin Somes.

21:36.527 --> 21:39.087
- Still in the company of Farnum?
- No, sir.

21:39.967 --> 21:43.880
They left the Gem, conversed a bit,
Farnum fell over backwards.

21:43.967 --> 21:48.199
Hearst then helped him back to his feet,
then the two parted company.

21:48.567 --> 21:51.764
That makes a lot of fucking sense, Con.
Well done.

21:53.647 --> 21:56.400
Farnum then returned to his hotel.

21:56.487 --> 21:58.682
They're readying for them nuptials.

21:58.767 --> 22:01.600
You know,
Ellsworth and the widow Garret's!

22:03.087 --> 22:07.205
Guess that's the last Ellsworth
will be seeing of a placer cradle.

22:09.607 --> 22:11.086
Set for life!

22:18.887 --> 22:20.036
Yeah.

22:21.287 --> 22:23.926
- Davey said you wanted to see me.
- Get in here.

22:24.247 --> 22:26.920
And help me parse Yankton's proposal.

22:27.287 --> 22:31.644
We study for our fucking lives.

22:41.007 --> 22:45.000
Three hours in camp,
going straight to exploring her vitals.

22:45.127 --> 22:47.561
Cy Tolliver, Mr Hearst,
that's acted for your interests...

22:47.647 --> 22:49.842
at one or several removes
these last couple of months.

22:49.927 --> 22:52.725
How do you do?
Did you buy me this hole?

22:53.167 --> 22:55.476
Off Marvin Somes, sir, yes, I did.

22:55.567 --> 22:58.320
She's out of colour, boys.
Let's fill her in.

22:58.407 --> 23:00.716
I was told to act on all offers.

23:00.807 --> 23:04.356
You did well, Mr Tolliver.
We want to be comprehensive.

23:07.647 --> 23:12.357
I been in the mud a bit for you myself,
Mr Hearst.

23:13.207 --> 23:16.404
Got my shovel out covering work of
your Mr Wolcott.

23:16.487 --> 23:18.205
Thank you for that.

23:18.447 --> 23:21.883
Scooped and scrubbed
and cleaned up the guts and gore...

23:21.967 --> 23:25.118
'cause I do what the business requires.

23:26.847 --> 23:28.326
There's my hotel.

23:29.167 --> 23:32.159
The camp elders called a meeting
in the aftermath.

23:32.767 --> 23:36.157
Barely time to wash my hands
before I talked them into washing theirs.

23:36.247 --> 23:38.442
I have been travelling, sir.

23:39.007 --> 23:42.158
Why don't we resume after I've rested?

23:42.687 --> 23:45.804
Well, I guess I can manage
a while longer...

23:45.887 --> 23:48.082
to keep the whiff off of him.

23:48.767 --> 23:51.998
Suspicion, Mr Hearst,
off your geologist, Wolcott...

23:52.087 --> 23:54.282
for cutting three whores' throats.

24:13.927 --> 24:15.963
Oh, cocksucker!

24:24.247 --> 24:26.602
I don't know why I seek you out.

24:28.287 --> 24:32.121
If lying in the ground
you can think or have feelings...

24:32.727 --> 24:35.002
you may hate me
and my part in your fate...

24:35.087 --> 24:38.045
as I sometimes hate you
for bringing me here.

24:42.967 --> 24:45.640
Though I know your bringing me
was the end of something...

24:45.727 --> 24:49.402
whose beginning I had
as much a part of, certainly, as you.

24:53.287 --> 24:54.686
I am afraid.

24:56.847 --> 25:00.476
I am so afraid that my life is living me...

25:00.567 --> 25:04.765
and soon will be over, and not
a moment of it will have been my own.

25:05.007 --> 25:08.761
And of how my body now tells me
that is fine and right.

25:10.567 --> 25:14.116
Perhaps I confide to you
because you cannot tell anyone.

25:22.687 --> 25:26.680
I am to have a child,
and I have a child in my care.

25:35.807 --> 25:37.445
He is a good man.

25:42.287 --> 25:44.881
And he whom I love is here as well.

25:51.407 --> 25:53.602
These walls are coming down.

25:54.007 --> 25:55.406
They'll be your walls soon.

25:55.487 --> 25:58.763
Ever since I was a child in Missouri,
I've been down every hole I could find.

25:58.847 --> 26:00.166
Boy-The-Earth-Talks-To.

26:00.247 --> 26:02.044
Yeah, I've told you
that's what the Indians call me.

26:02.127 --> 26:03.196
Yes.

26:03.647 --> 26:06.286
It talks to you, too, Francis. I know.

26:06.607 --> 26:09.724
In our time together,
your hearing has stayed keen.

26:10.327 --> 26:11.999
But this gambler, Tolliver...

26:12.087 --> 26:15.318
who was our agent
for securing the claims...

26:15.807 --> 26:17.525
has spoken to me about you.

26:18.647 --> 26:22.162
He says that you killed women.
Prostitutes.

26:24.367 --> 26:26.642
That he has disposed
of the bodies for you.

26:29.407 --> 26:30.760
Well?

26:35.407 --> 26:39.286
When I was in Campeche,
you wrote a letter on my behalf.

26:40.367 --> 26:42.358
To the Jefe de Policía.

26:44.007 --> 26:48.842
"I am aware of Mr Wolcott's difficulty.
You will find me personally grateful...

26:48.927 --> 26:51.805
"for any adjustments you may make
in his case. "

26:55.567 --> 26:57.319
What did you think that was about?

26:57.407 --> 27:00.763
I didn't think about it.
You were my agent in Mexico.

27:01.447 --> 27:02.721
You had many responsibilities.

27:02.807 --> 27:04.525
You asked me for the letter,
and I wrote it.

27:04.607 --> 27:07.644
As when the earth talks to you,
particularly, you never ask its reasons?

27:07.727 --> 27:09.922
I don't need to know why I'm lucky.

27:12.047 --> 27:16.086
What if the earth talks to us
to get us to arrange its amusements?

27:16.167 --> 27:18.806
That sounds like goddamn nonsense
to me.

27:18.887 --> 27:22.118
Suppose to you it whispers...

27:23.207 --> 27:26.040
"You are king over me.
I exist to flesh your will. "

27:26.127 --> 27:27.401
Nonsense.

27:27.567 --> 27:31.799
And to me, "There is no sin. "

27:37.247 --> 27:40.444
It happened in Mexico,
and now it's happened here.

27:53.847 --> 27:57.476
We must end our connection,
you understand that, Francis?

27:58.727 --> 28:02.037
Make a severance you think fair.
You know I won't quibble.

28:03.967 --> 28:08.119
Does some spirit overtake you?
Is that what you mean by the talk?

28:11.127 --> 28:12.162
No.

28:14.887 --> 28:18.436
It tells me where the colour is.
That's all it tells me.

28:21.487 --> 28:23.000
My God.

28:27.207 --> 28:30.722
This has to be a date certain.
"Timely fashion" means fucking nothing.

28:30.847 --> 28:34.840
"Timely fashion" means
when they got the fix in.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.319
So when do you want the elections?

28:37.407 --> 28:40.001
- The sooner the fucking better.
- Six weeks?

28:41.927 --> 28:43.201
No more.

28:43.487 --> 28:45.000
Far as bringing ringers in...

28:45.087 --> 28:48.557
"period of residence" would be
a nice shiv to stick in their fucking ribs.

28:48.647 --> 28:51.036
And now you're using
your fucking noodle.

28:51.527 --> 28:53.802
How do we put that into words?

28:54.767 --> 28:56.564
"Period of residence. "

28:56.647 --> 28:59.957
- Are you being smart with me?
- How would you put it?

29:00.887 --> 29:04.163
Period of residence not less than what?

29:04.927 --> 29:06.246
Two weeks.

29:06.887 --> 29:09.355
No one is eligible to vote...

29:10.207 --> 29:12.118
unless they've been two weeks
in the camp.

29:12.207 --> 29:14.084
Unless committed to dump
in our favour.

29:14.167 --> 29:16.476
I'd like to get this fucking thing done.

29:16.567 --> 29:18.558
"... has not been...

29:19.887 --> 29:22.321
"two weeks in camp. "

29:28.087 --> 29:31.602
Now I'll tell you what the fuck else.
And it makes me weep to say it.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.485
Take out the fucking 50.
From Yankton to us.

29:34.567 --> 29:36.558
Shall I urge you to reconsider?

29:36.807 --> 29:38.604
We get this thing off the ground...

29:38.687 --> 29:42.236
I will be without peer of
robbing these cocksuckers senseless.

29:42.327 --> 29:46.161
I don't want the founding document
recording a fucking bribe.

29:48.127 --> 29:52.882
Strike Number 4 from the original,
with disgust it was even brought up.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.355
What else?

30:00.807 --> 30:04.322
Summon that cat-piss-smelling
fuckhead and His Holiness the Sheriff.

30:11.807 --> 30:14.480
Commissioner! Shall we chat?

30:24.207 --> 30:26.596
Ain't you two a fucking picture?

30:27.127 --> 30:30.915
Trixie, you save me a trip.

30:32.927 --> 30:34.645
You should've let it
hit her in the schnoz.

30:34.727 --> 30:37.161
Remind her of escorts in days past.

30:37.247 --> 30:39.761
That's a gift for the bride...

30:39.847 --> 30:42.725
from her child's former tutor in absentia.

30:42.807 --> 30:47.119
Whirling her around is okay, Star.
Just don't tread on her fucking toes.

30:49.447 --> 30:52.405
Adams?
You saw Yankton's hypocrite, huh?

30:53.087 --> 30:55.885
Just His Holiness.
Then we'll have a quorum.

31:12.127 --> 31:15.403
Go ahead and take that to him, Captain.
Thank you.

31:38.807 --> 31:40.126
Bless you.

31:46.047 --> 31:49.756
Bless you. Bless you. Bless you.

31:50.567 --> 31:53.035
I'm in the day's fucking talents, Tom.

31:53.127 --> 31:55.800
There's talk of an offer on my place.

31:56.927 --> 32:00.886
- How will you answer?
- I came to take counsel with you.

32:00.967 --> 32:03.527
Drunk or sober, is my question.

32:03.687 --> 32:05.564
Well, I have my wits about me, Al.

32:05.647 --> 32:06.875
Maybe, then.

32:07.487 --> 32:10.001
You'll want a few more, huh?

32:10.087 --> 32:12.647
Don't talk to me in fucking riddles.

32:12.727 --> 32:16.720
Drunk, Tom, for reasons
not to do with business, you'll sell.

32:17.207 --> 32:19.482
If that's your decision, let me offer.

32:19.567 --> 32:22.764
Sober, you know selling's stupid.

32:22.887 --> 32:25.845
What's my reason
not to do with business?

32:25.927 --> 32:27.883
Use your own fucking faculties.

32:32.407 --> 32:33.556
Remorse.

32:33.647 --> 32:36.684
Over that boy
that was not your fucking fault.

32:38.847 --> 32:40.041
Again?

32:42.007 --> 32:43.520
Not right now.

32:47.167 --> 32:50.045
Ellsworth and the widow Garret.

32:51.247 --> 32:53.886
What odds would you have made
on that?

32:54.527 --> 32:56.802
Every so often there's a love match.

33:20.927 --> 33:23.487
Isn't it time to start the ceremony?

33:40.647 --> 33:42.922
And now, my dear lady...

33:43.727 --> 33:47.163
shall I part thou leather lips?

34:21.687 --> 34:23.643
It's the damn underwear.

34:25.127 --> 34:29.359
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered
together here in the sight of God...

34:29.447 --> 34:31.358
"and in the face of this company...

34:31.447 --> 34:35.725
"to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

34:37.007 --> 34:41.125
"Which estate, instituted of God
at the time of man's innocency...

34:41.647 --> 34:44.081
"signifying unto us the mystical union...

34:44.167 --> 34:46.681
"that is betwixt Christ and his church.

34:47.087 --> 34:49.647
"Therefore,
not to be entered into lightly...

34:49.726 --> 34:54.676
"but reverently, discreetly,
advisedly, soberly, and in fear of God.

34:56.007 --> 34:58.441
"If any man here can show just cause...

34:58.527 --> 35:00.836
"why they may not
be lawfully joined together...

35:00.927 --> 35:05.364
"let him now speak, or else
hereafter forever hold his peace. "

35:07.087 --> 35:09.157
"Whitney Conway Ellsworth...

35:10.607 --> 35:13.679
"wilt thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife...

35:14.207 --> 35:18.917
"to live after God's ordinance
in the holy estate of matrimony?

35:19.167 --> 35:22.716
"Wilt thou love her,
comfort her, honour and keep her...

35:22.807 --> 35:24.445
"in sickness and in health...

35:24.527 --> 35:28.042
"and forsaking all others,
keep thee only unto her...

35:28.127 --> 35:30.436
"as long as ye both shall live?"

35:30.567 --> 35:31.716
I will.

35:32.087 --> 35:33.884
"Alma Russell Garret...

35:33.967 --> 35:37.039
"wilt thou have this man
to thy wedded husband...

35:37.127 --> 35:41.040
"to live together after God's ordinance
in the holy estate of matrimony?"

35:41.127 --> 35:42.196
I will.

35:42.447 --> 35:43.516
Continuing.

35:43.607 --> 35:46.041
"Wilt thou obey him and serve him...

35:46.127 --> 35:49.164
"love, honour and keep him,
in sickness and in health...

35:49.247 --> 35:51.238
"and forsaking all others...

35:51.327 --> 35:54.763
"keep thee only unto him
as long as ye both shall live?"

35:55.047 --> 35:56.241
I will.

35:58.407 --> 36:01.126
Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?

36:01.207 --> 36:03.038
I do. Both.

36:04.247 --> 36:07.523
Say after me,
"I, Whitney Conway Ellsworth... "

36:08.207 --> 36:11.438
"I, Whitney Conway Ellsworth... "

36:11.767 --> 36:14.406
"... vow to love, cherish and protect... "

36:14.607 --> 36:17.167
"... vow to love, cherish and protect... "

36:17.247 --> 36:21.160
"... till death do us part,
according to God's holy ordinance... "

36:21.967 --> 36:26.040
"... till death do us part,
according to God's holy ordinance... "

36:26.367 --> 36:29.200
"... and thereto I give to thee my troth. "

36:29.407 --> 36:32.126
"... and thereto I give to thee my troth. "

36:33.927 --> 36:37.681
Say after me,
"I, Alma Russell Garret... "

36:39.687 --> 36:42.440
"I, Alma Russell Garret... "

36:42.727 --> 36:45.116
"... vow to love, cherish and obey... "

36:45.207 --> 36:48.040
"... vow to love, cherish and obey... "

36:48.127 --> 36:51.642
"... till death do us part,
according to God's holy ordinance... "

36:51.727 --> 36:54.958
"... till death do us part,
according to God's holy ordinance... "

36:55.047 --> 36:57.686
"... and thereto I give to thee my troth. "

36:57.767 --> 37:00.486
"... and thereto I give to thee my troth. "

37:01.527 --> 37:02.846
The ring?

37:09.047 --> 37:11.197
"With this ring I thee wed. "

37:13.327 --> 37:15.602
"With this ring I thee wed. "

37:16.687 --> 37:20.885
"Those whom God has joined together,
let no man put asunder. "

37:21.647 --> 37:24.400
"For inasmuch as Alma and Whitney...

37:24.487 --> 37:27.081
"have consented together
in holy wedlock...

37:27.167 --> 37:30.842
"and have witnessed the same
before God and this company...

37:31.047 --> 37:35.598
"and thereto have given and pledged
their troth, each to the other...

37:36.327 --> 37:41.003
"and have declared the same by giving
and receiving a ring and joining hands...

37:41.687 --> 37:44.645
"I now pronounce
that they are man and wife. "

37:58.047 --> 38:00.163
We ask you all to join us...

38:00.247 --> 38:04.923
for collation and dancing
in the thoroughfare.

38:23.287 --> 38:24.436
Shit!

38:26.007 --> 38:28.680
- What's so fucking funny, Jenn?
- Nothing.

38:35.447 --> 38:39.679
Who are you fucking clapping orders at,
Wu? You only got us on loan.

38:43.447 --> 38:45.005
Oh, for Christ's sake!

38:45.087 --> 38:48.124
I guess in for a penny,
in for a fucking pound.

38:48.447 --> 38:49.641
Swearengen.

38:49.727 --> 38:51.683
He wouldn't allow it
if I went up and ask him.

38:51.767 --> 38:52.995
Swearengen!

39:05.407 --> 39:07.363
You wanna swap masks?

39:21.007 --> 39:24.682
- What the fuck you looking at?
- I wasn't fucking looking at you!

39:36.927 --> 39:39.839
Mr Ellsworth,
was I right about the gloves?

39:48.527 --> 39:51.360
Full and final payment, Mr Tolliver...

39:51.607 --> 39:55.441
for what service you conceive
you rendered me.

39:55.927 --> 40:00.045
The Lord himself would testify
to me having served you, Mr Hearst...

40:00.967 --> 40:04.084
and to what should be my just reward.

40:06.287 --> 40:10.280
Is that the cocksucker addressing us
from the fucking whirlwind?

40:11.527 --> 40:14.803
"George Hearst, Cy's just reward...

40:15.647 --> 40:19.720
"every claim he helped you buy,
he's in for 5%.

40:21.127 --> 40:25.882
"Cy, as I'll sometimes
be busy elsewheres...

40:26.247 --> 40:29.876
"take your own fucking precautions
you're fairly treated.

40:30.287 --> 40:34.997
"Should George try to fuck you,
Wolcott's letter gets broad circulation. "

40:37.087 --> 40:38.805
Tell me what letter you mean.

40:40.207 --> 40:43.643
George asks
what letter you refer to, Lord.

40:47.647 --> 40:52.118
"That you, Cy,
before you disposed of them whores...

40:52.207 --> 40:54.038
"made that murdering geologist write...

40:54.127 --> 40:57.802
"once he told you
George knew of his habits. "

41:01.367 --> 41:03.927
Disturb you, being in the public eye?

41:04.487 --> 41:07.160
Some don't mind.
Fuck, some men like it.

41:07.967 --> 41:12.006
- But I wonder if you're among them.
- Stop moving your hand, sir.

41:12.807 --> 41:16.163
I mean you no harm,
but I can't speak for Captain Turner.

41:19.207 --> 41:22.040
"Put your hand down, Cy. "
I hear you, Lord.

41:25.367 --> 41:29.485
The press being sold-out cunts,
it hardly matters that a story's true.

41:29.567 --> 41:31.478
But one like this, that is...

41:31.567 --> 41:34.798
sporting a man like you
and a fucked-up geologist...

41:34.887 --> 41:39.085
and whores dug up from shallow graves
with their throats slit from ear to ear...

41:39.167 --> 41:41.681
and the same to their poor privates.

41:42.087 --> 41:43.566
What's that, Lord?

41:44.887 --> 41:46.479
Would you, Lord?

41:46.567 --> 41:48.558
You dirty-minded cocksucker.

41:49.087 --> 41:52.284
He says
he'd follow a story like that himself.

41:55.167 --> 42:00.082
5%. Your interests seen to
by one that controls his appetites.

42:16.647 --> 42:19.844
You'd first want to know from Wolcott
if there is a letter.

42:40.687 --> 42:43.599
You got your quiver full of words again,
don't you?

42:44.247 --> 42:47.045
I found him in the woods.
All's he could say was, "I'm sorry. "

42:51.887 --> 42:54.196
First I knew Andy,
all's he could say was, "Deal. "

44:37.007 --> 44:40.044
Davey,
tell Merrick to go ahead and print.

44:50.247 --> 44:54.718
Fraught with contingencies, chief,
is our fucking electoral process.

44:55.047 --> 44:58.642
Will His Holiness climb into a bottle
or pursue the widow, stiff-pricked...

44:58.727 --> 45:01.639
the miles
to her Hot Springs honeymoon?

45:02.927 --> 45:05.487
Who'll bear
the locals' banner then, huh?

45:43.567 --> 45:47.003
Most men, Andy, once they've brought
one fucking plague to the camp...

45:47.087 --> 45:48.600
would lay the fuck off.

45:48.687 --> 45:52.123
Not you!
No, you're gonna bible-talk my whores.

45:52.567 --> 45:54.603
God is not mocked, Cy.

45:55.447 --> 45:58.723
You've got a pestilence
for every fucking occasion!

45:59.287 --> 46:02.245
God is not mocked, you son of a bitch!

46:09.127 --> 46:11.595
He fucking gutted me.

46:11.687 --> 46:13.359
See to him, honey.

46:14.927 --> 46:16.918
I ain't gonna die.

46:19.567 --> 46:21.523
Don't let me die.

47:29.727 --> 47:31.604
Welcome the fuck back.

47:32.527 --> 47:34.483
- Miss Stubbs.
- Mr Utter.

47:37.527 --> 47:40.997
They dance on, chief,
however much at home...

47:41.687 --> 47:45.566
as at yours and mine,
comfort and love await.

47:53.207 --> 47:55.767
Unhurt, it appears.

47:56.447 --> 47:59.007
Don't hold for them
that went against us.

47:59.087 --> 48:01.123
I should hope fucking not.

48:03.447 --> 48:04.721
How'd he fight?

48:04.807 --> 48:07.879
He gave a good fucking account,
did Mr Wu.

48:08.447 --> 48:09.516
Lee?

48:10.047 --> 48:12.083
San Francisco cocksucker.

48:12.967 --> 48:14.685
Well done, then, men.

48:15.127 --> 48:18.722
And well done, Adams.
The day's full course, indoors and out.

48:19.247 --> 48:20.805
Thanks, thanks.

48:20.887 --> 48:22.559
You saved my bacon
in that fucking alley.

48:22.647 --> 48:24.717
- Jesus Christ!
- Fucking Adams.

48:28.967 --> 48:31.800
- Swearengen!
- All right, Wu.

48:40.087 --> 48:42.601
Wu America!

48:43.047 --> 48:46.039
That'll hold you tight to her tit.

49:03.127 --> 49:06.881
Elections! Elections are coming!

49:07.087 --> 49:11.285
Territorial governor agrees
to local elections!

49:11.367 --> 49:12.880
Elections are coming!

49:21.647 --> 49:24.525
Don't you have a fucking home
to get to?

50:35.607 --> 50:38.326
I believe it's to your fucking right.

50:39.847 --> 50:42.361
Hey, we ain't done fucking dancing!
