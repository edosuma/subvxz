01:17.560 --> 01:18.580
Sven?

01:19.220 --> 01:20.030
Sven!

01:20.030 --> 01:21.640
Come on

04:36.920 --> 04:38.150
No

04:38.150 --> 04:39.520
shh

04:39.520 --> 04:40.640
I am here

04:40.640 --> 04:43.120
Time to sleep

04:43.120 --> 04:45.210
I can not

04:45.870 --> 04:48.370
I keep thinking of him

04:48.370 --> 04:50.910
I know, I know

05:14.240 --> 05:15.740
mother

05:16.450 --> 05:17.800
Yes

05:19.080 --> 05:21.420
I haven't slept well lately

05:22.320 --> 05:24.050
Are you ill?

05:24.050 --> 05:26.190
Fidgety?

05:26.700 --> 05:28.790
I had a bad dream

05:28.790 --> 05:30.170
Almost every night

05:31.130 --> 05:33.530
You're afraid to go back to sleep

05:35.770 --> 05:37.070
No

05:37.760 --> 05:39.420
I'm awake

05:40.180 --> 05:42.070
Think what that means

05:42.930 --> 05:45.360
You sound like your father

05:45.790 --> 05:47.520
Your grandfather

05:47.520 --> 05:49.510
He also often dreams

05:50.630 --> 05:52.540
That's no good

05:53.100 --> 05:55.300
This will pass

06:13.440 --> 06:15.610
Oh, calm down

06:16.500 --> 06:18.640
Remember you breathe

06:19.660 --> 06:21.450
Feel the forest calm

06:26.390 --> 06:28.000
I am indeed

06:31.360 --> 06:32.580
I heard that

06:32.640 --> 06:34.520
I know

06:38.880 --> 06:41.200
Dad is much better when he's my age

06:43.310 --> 06:44.820
Is that what he told you?

06:45.250 --> 06:46.630
Yes

06:47.830 --> 06:49.970
When he was your age

06:49.970 --> 06:51.800
He doesn't like anything except the one he loves

06:51.800 --> 06:53.510
Bows and arrows

06:54.250 --> 06:56.670
He even kept it in bed
with him at night

06:56.670 --> 06:58.910
But does that make him better

06:59.980 --> 07:01.640
No

07:01.870 --> 07:04.190
No bow

07:04.190 --> 07:06.200
Do something else
for the time being

07:06.200 --> 07:08.450
Something you really enjoy

07:11.170 --> 07:13.210
I enjoy it

07:15.910 --> 07:17.700
You sound like him

08:37.090 --> 08:39.030
I can hear you

08:52.260 --> 08:55.800
Did I ever tell father
frighten angry reindeer

08:56.870 --> 08:59.470
Hm, no, not as I recall

08:59.830 --> 09:01.940
Dad and I are looking for honey bees

09:01.940 --> 09:04.110
When the wildebeest comes

09:04.110 --> 09:05.380
Right in front of us

09:05.380 --> 09:07.850
And I think the reindeer is also afraid

09:07.850 --> 09:09.030
When he saw us

09:09.030 --> 09:11.420
He was angry and butting
us with the horns

09:12.010 --> 09:13.260
Do you know what happens next?

09:14.530 --> 09:16.470
No, what happens next?

09:16.470 --> 09:18.050
Dad stretched his arms

09:18.050 --> 09:19.960
And scream, and scare him

09:19.960 --> 09:22.250
And he stood very very tall

09:22.250 --> 09:24.850
And looked him in the eyes

09:25.340 --> 09:27.020
Take it away

09:45.550 --> 09:47.210
Grandfather

09:47.670 --> 09:49.860
Do you think dad is dead?

09:57.860 --> 09:59.160
No

09:59.160 --> 10:00.640
No, I don't

10:00.640 --> 10:02.830
But many died during the attack

10:02.830 --> 10:05.000
And many returned

10:05.000 --> 10:07.900
He was just late, that's all

10:07.900 --> 10:10.220
Many returned

10:10.220 --> 10:12.010
Remember, he did this for us

10:12.720 --> 10:14.910
It's been two years

10:14.910 --> 10:17.560
Maybe he won't come back

10:17.560 --> 10:19.910
When I think of him

10:19.910 --> 10:22.050
Like I saw him in the water

10:22.050 --> 10:24.340
Or mist

10:26.870 --> 10:28.830
I also joined the attack
when I was young

10:28.830 --> 10:30.990
I just want to come back with

10:30.990 --> 10:32.800
Name and wealth

10:33.420 --> 10:35.280
And me indeed

10:35.990 --> 10:38.540
But one treasure that I brought home

10:38.540 --> 10:40.650
It did not last long

10:41.370 --> 10:42.970
I have good eyes

10:43.970 --> 10:46.440
And my aim is right

10:47.510 --> 10:50.700
And when I show it
myself to the chieftain

10:50.700 --> 10:53.680
She gave your grandmother to me as her husband

10:53.680 --> 10:55.460
My good eyes give me that

10:57.530 --> 10:59.210
But I later settled

10:59.210 --> 11:02.090
And we have you and your sister

11:02.520 --> 11:04.660
And my eyes began to fade

11:06.120 --> 11:08.590
The moon makes me do it

11:09.280 --> 11:12.410
That's a real gift for my happiness

11:18.430 --> 11:21.640
And I will be happy
sacrifice it again

11:22.200 --> 11:24.370
If I'm given a choice

11:26.940 --> 11:29.340
Come on in

11:30.280 --> 11:31.830
Oh

11:52.700 --> 11:54.110
Runa

11:54.420 --> 11:57.130
Don't throw away your love for horses
that, we have to sell it

11:57.910 --> 12:00.360
But you can't sell it

12:00.360 --> 12:02.650
Go fishing. Mother

12:02.650 --> 12:04.570
Maybe we can all go fishing

12:08.830 --> 12:11.570
Come on, Bothild.Bothild lives with me

14:16.350 --> 14:18.560
I fall

14:18.920 --> 14:21.290
Into the lake? How?

14:21.800 --> 14:24.650
I just fell, no more

14:24.650 --> 14:26.880
Dont worry

14:33.310 --> 14:35.890
I want my father to survive this trip

14:36.900 --> 14:39.490
He promised to bring something to me

14:40.510 --> 14:42.020
Eat your food

14:42.020 --> 14:45.320
I knew he would bring it
something for you dear

14:47.230 --> 14:50.320
I miss him

14:50.800 --> 14:52.790
Yes I know

14:52.790 --> 14:54.330
We all do it

15:02.990 --> 15:05.700
Obviously he doesn't miss us

15:05.700 --> 15:09.140
If yes, he has found it
way home now

15:09.140 --> 15:10.160
No

15:12.810 --> 15:16.290
Or maybe he doesn't want to talk about it

15:16.470 --> 15:20.770
No

15:32.970 --> 15:35.070
Where's mother

15:48.030 --> 15:49.890
mother

15:51.630 --> 15:53.110
You do it again

15:55.100 --> 15:57.880
What? Standing there

15:58.040 --> 15:59.640
Not doing anything

16:00.580 --> 16:03.070
I can not do anything
in my own house

16:03.070 --> 16:06.000
Without you complaining

16:07.190 --> 16:09.720
Not doing anything

16:11.030 --> 16:13.380
Stop it

16:13.380 --> 16:15.300
What happened

16:18.730 --> 16:20.440
You're not alone in this matter know

16:21.110 --> 16:24.090
We are here too, suffering just like you

16:24.090 --> 16:27.630
You don't know my mind, son

16:27.630 --> 16:32.630
Because you're quiet. Don't you
dare to talk to me like that

16:36.320 --> 16:40.190
You think of me, right?
Do you have work to do?

16:40.190 --> 16:42.880
They are done, how is yours?

16:46.050 --> 16:48.360
Back inside

16:48.360 --> 16:50.660
Take care of your sister

16:51.390 --> 16:53.110
No

16:53.880 --> 16:56.530
Exit!

16:56.530 --> 16:58.310
I want to talk about dad

16:58.310 --> 16:59.910
Go to your sister!

16:59.910 --> 17:01.910
Because you don't do it anymore!

17:03.000 --> 17:05.450
What do you want me to say?

17:05.450 --> 17:07.280
I miss him?

17:07.280 --> 17:09.530
I still love him?

17:09.530 --> 17:11.560
You want me to say

17:11.560 --> 17:16.180
I believe he will come back
with a black stallion?

17:16.180 --> 17:19.230
When he won't, he won't!

17:19.230 --> 17:21.319
He has left us

17:21.319 --> 17:23.260
He has left us

17:23.260 --> 17:26.950
here to rot

17:29.080 --> 17:31.950
Can't you see, that
you who left us

17:33.160 --> 17:35.160
At least dad tried, but

17:35.160 --> 17:40.160
Maybe you want to go too
Also, then just leave

17:40.160 --> 17:43.240
Take your bow and go

17:43.240 --> 17:47.490
And leave me here

17:54.090 --> 17:56.900
Where are you going? Hunting

18:30.580 --> 18:33.450
Sometimes I think I can see him again

18:35.030 --> 18:37.780
I imagined it in my head

18:37.780 --> 18:41.710
Sound in the forest

18:42.350 --> 18:44.570
Aroma ...

18:44.570 --> 18:46.820
Leaves and flowers

18:48.060 --> 18:51.100
Grow and rot

18:51.100 --> 18:53.650
Born and rot

18:54.720 --> 18:58.010
This is very real to me, very

18:58.810 --> 19:00.870
Close and strong

19:04.350 --> 19:07.020
I've lived a long time

19:08.660 --> 19:11.690
Soon I will rot, become soil

19:13.120 --> 19:16.880
I wish there was green moss growing above me

19:16.880 --> 19:19.820
Sweet green moss

19:21.570 --> 19:23.890
And maybe you can bring some home

19:23.890 --> 19:27.140
talk to my grave and
sing to my bones

19:35.040 --> 19:37.650
I can't see anything

19:37.650 --> 19:42.650
But I refuse to die before talking
to my son one last time

19:52.260 --> 19:54.350
You are upset?

19:55.860 --> 19:58.150
I saw something today

19:59.970 --> 20:01.770
What do you see?

20:11.070 --> 20:14.500
and he fell into the water like

20:14.500 --> 20:16.730
I dreamed

20:17.650 --> 20:20.670
But I know I'm awake

20:23.930 --> 20:27.780
You believe what you see is a woman

20:29.480 --> 20:32.720
Yes. - Tell me

20:37.440 --> 20:40.050
I see mother

20:40.050 --> 20:43.170
You and Bothild

20:45.510 --> 20:47.430
In the hole

20:47.430 --> 20:52.100
Maybe it's nothing, it's getting more
hard to remember when I tried it

20:53.880 --> 20:56.500
You sure are nothing

20:59.170 --> 21:01.500
There is something else

21:01.500 --> 21:04.750
After that, in the distance

21:04.750 --> 21:07.950
I saw a flock of birds
lying dead on the ground

21:09.800 --> 21:11.270
Do not know why

21:12.280 --> 21:15.200
Bad sign with a dead bird

21:15.200 --> 21:19.190
Sounds like you're banging
your head when it falls

21:20.070 --> 21:21.710
Don't start looking

21:21.710 --> 21:24.710
a sign in everything you see

21:25.180 --> 21:28.540
It will only lead
sadness and worry

22:37.870 --> 22:39.560
Who is there?

22:43.650 --> 22:45.880
I meant no harm

22:47.750 --> 22:49.850
It is okay

23:10.470 --> 23:12.980
What happened? Who is he?

23:12.980 --> 23:14.960
Go call mom, hurry

23:18.080 --> 23:20.550
Bothild, stay

23:24.050 --> 23:25.550
soldier

23:25.770 --> 23:27.620
Where did you find him?

23:27.620 --> 23:30.850
In the far forest

23:30.850 --> 23:34.290
We have to save him

23:35.250 --> 23:38.240
He can barely move,
we have to help him

23:38.480 --> 23:40.840
You should have left him in the forest there

23:40.840 --> 23:43.740
Bring him back before he wakes up

23:48.510 --> 23:51.300
Your father will be ashamed of you if you know

24:05.580 --> 24:08.080
The fever is very high,

24:08.080 --> 24:09.770
He might die tonight

24:09.770 --> 24:12.020
Or in a few days

24:12.020 --> 24:14.690
There isn't much we can do

24:16.630 --> 24:19.690
There is a possibility he will live

24:22.710 --> 24:27.260
I'm not sure, this flower can help

24:30.070 --> 24:31.980
Thank you

24:32.870 --> 24:34.520
Hide her

24:34.950 --> 24:37.390
We put him in a goat pen

24:37.390 --> 24:39.120
He won't survive either

24:39.120 --> 24:41.710
I don't want him at home

24:47.380 --> 24:48.860
Who is she?

24:50.490 --> 24:52.240
We do not know

24:54.780 --> 24:56.270
What did he say

24:58.440 --> 25:01.530
He talked about gold when he came here

25:01.530 --> 25:04.040
I hope he will be safe

25:04.040 --> 25:05.970
But the fever is a threat

25:06.370 --> 25:08.770
He was forced to sleep outside

25:08.770 --> 25:11.190
He looks sick mom

25:11.410 --> 25:13.240
Maybe he knows something about dad

25:13.240 --> 25:16.140
Or he will slit
our neck in sleep

25:17.260 --> 25:20.140
Bothild can you please bring him water

25:20.140 --> 25:23.450
No, that's enough, you
don't approach him anymore

25:36.060 --> 25:38.350
Odin

25:38.810 --> 25:41.270
God of greatness

25:42.580 --> 25:45.800
A horse that falls and breaks its bones

25:45.800 --> 25:48.870
God beside him

25:48.870 --> 25:51.460
Blood cleanses it

25:51.460 --> 25:53.180
From bone to bone

25:53.180 --> 25:55.880
Bless him

26:21.360 --> 26:24.180
What's the matter? That guy

26:26.010 --> 26:28.000
He was in pain

26:53.400 --> 26:55.310
Do not be afraid

26:55.780 --> 26:58.950
I think we should bring the man inside

27:50.000 --> 27:51.580
Make sure you drink water

27:53.420 --> 27:55.660
I'll

28:39.620 --> 28:41.720
Where are you going?

28:41.720 --> 28:45.230
I have to go to the market. Without us?

28:46.930 --> 28:50.230
You have to take care of your sister,
he can't be alone

28:59.780 --> 29:01.910
Good boy

29:03.560 --> 29:05.670
Sorry

29:09.560 --> 29:11.850
I wish you a healthy friend

29:11.850 --> 29:14.210
You too

29:15.120 --> 29:18.430
so indeed

29:19.520 --> 29:22.280
Um

29:27.280 --> 29:28.960
I'm not sure you will come

29:29.660 --> 29:31.750
I haven't seen you in the market lately

29:31.750 --> 29:34.980
People miss your skin and fur

29:43.030 --> 29:46.300
I'm starting to believe the forest swallowed up your family

29:46.530 --> 29:49.480
I'm busy

29:50.040 --> 29:52.840
It must have been hard with my husband away

29:52.840 --> 29:55.880
Is Ragnvald still alive? Yes

29:56.820 --> 29:58.960
Strong old goat

29:58.960 --> 30:01.350
Obviously you will lose everything, right

30:04.290 --> 30:07.050
I guess your daughter will come along

30:07.050 --> 30:09.280
No, not this time

30:11.050 --> 30:15.090
This is your husband's horse, right? Yes indeed

30:29.500 --> 30:31.470
I know you are sad

30:35.990 --> 30:38.260
But I sell the skin

30:39.280 --> 30:41.730
I brought this for you

30:43.480 --> 30:45.800
I can bring it

30:58.580 --> 31:01.510
Beautiful, thanks mom

31:01.970 --> 31:05.200
You remember

31:07.890 --> 31:10.480
What you remember

31:14.650 --> 31:17.050
Thank you

33:47.810 --> 33:50.100
Are you blind, sir?

33:51.800 --> 33:53.040
Yes

33:54.820 --> 33:58.040
Are you thirsty? Yes

34:07.200 --> 34:11.150
Thank you

34:14.560 --> 34:19.050
This

34:19.929 --> 34:23.750
I'm Torulf from Gelstie

34:23.750 --> 34:26.380
I'm Ragnvald

34:26.710 --> 34:29.060
And this poop hole

34:29.060 --> 34:30.449
This

34:32.409 --> 34:34.850
I traveled with your son

34:36.429 --> 34:39.380
Were you with him in the attack? Yes

34:39.380 --> 34:41.159
Is he still alive?

34:41.850 --> 34:44.380
Last time I saw
he, he is still alive

34:44.380 --> 34:46.659
And that's about

34:46.659 --> 34:48.880
a week ago, more or less

34:51.679 --> 34:56.679
You're done with this, right
can use a man too

35:01.490 --> 35:03.670
You must be Runa

35:05.430 --> 35:06.970
That's Runa

35:06.970 --> 35:09.650
who brought you here and treated your wounds

35:10.260 --> 35:14.140
I owe you one

35:24.550 --> 35:26.250
Who did that to you?

35:26.250 --> 35:29.560
That's my friend

35:32.030 --> 35:35.130
I've escaped them

35:35.710 --> 35:37.620
Your shipmate?

35:43.330 --> 35:47.340
We were 24 people when leaving
Agre two years ago

35:49.080 --> 35:51.960
First we sailed past the east coast

35:51.960 --> 35:53.500
To Quland

35:54.270 --> 35:56.600
But we have no luck there

35:57.080 --> 36:00.820
We went all the way to Garderich

36:01.080 --> 36:04.670
We fought with local residents

36:04.670 --> 36:08.260
With strong defense

36:10.800 --> 36:12.390
When winter comes

36:12.390 --> 36:16.410
We serve one
sir as his bodyguard

36:16.410 --> 36:20.410
And he pays with
silver, but that's not enough

36:21.660 --> 36:25.410
And ... we decided to leave

36:26.770 --> 36:30.070
Try our luck
in the south, on the land of Islavic

36:31.100 --> 36:34.150
But there were others there before us

36:34.390 --> 36:37.720
We continue south

36:38.240 --> 36:41.390
And we found a market

36:43.520 --> 36:46.960
And we attack like
starving wolf

36:50.040 --> 36:54.830
We are stupid, poor

36:55.710 --> 36:58.920
They have never seen
like that before,

36:58.920 --> 37:00.980
So we lost our mind

37:00.980 --> 37:03.670
We forgot to watch

37:05.780 --> 37:08.190
We were attacked by French people

37:08.190 --> 37:10.330
they are 3 times more than us

37:10.330 --> 37:12.400
And they are well armed

37:14.420 --> 37:18.210
We fight to save
ourselves on the coast of France

37:24.220 --> 37:27.310
And when we escaped, we
barely have enough people

37:27.310 --> 37:29.640
To run the ship

37:29.640 --> 37:33.330
We lost half the people
us, and our booty

37:35.440 --> 37:37.690
We will die

37:37.690 --> 37:39.320
If not for Joar

37:39.320 --> 37:41.890
And the arrow

37:43.130 --> 37:45.380
And we sailed north

37:45.380 --> 37:49.370
And we returned to the mainland

37:53.960 --> 37:55.360
We buried

37:55.360 --> 37:58.770
Those who died of wounds at sea

38:02.730 --> 38:04.350
That night

38:04.790 --> 38:07.840
One of the crew found a fallen tree

38:11.490 --> 38:13.650
Root soars into the air

38:13.650 --> 38:15.940
Like a finger reaching to the sky

38:19.230 --> 38:20.940
At the root of it,

38:21.720 --> 38:24.380
There is a big gold ring

38:25.150 --> 38:27.840
Like a gift from God

38:27.840 --> 38:30.110
We dug down the tree

38:30.480 --> 38:32.750
And we found an old graveyard

38:32.750 --> 38:35.560
Full of treasure

38:35.560 --> 38:37.990
We were told

38:39.110 --> 38:42.650
We were told to leave

38:42.650 --> 38:45.210
That's a bad thing to
steal from the dead

38:48.080 --> 38:49.920
What we do

38:52.990 --> 38:55.250
We divide the treasure between us

38:55.250 --> 38:57.810
And finally

38:57.810 --> 38:59.410
he took part

39:03.760 --> 39:07.230
We slept that night

39:11.070 --> 39:13.410
And in the morning

39:14.790 --> 39:16.900
Everything changes

39:17.900 --> 39:19.710
Oh

39:19.710 --> 39:21.870
What happened

39:23.430 --> 39:26.870
Some of our people
start attacking each other

39:28.080 --> 39:30.320
Want gold for themselves

39:31.250 --> 39:34.480
Joar and I split

39:34.480 --> 39:39.480
But I'm still injured from war with people
France, so he told me to run first

39:39.740 --> 39:41.040
And I do

39:43.310 --> 39:45.710
That bastard is chasing me too

39:47.730 --> 39:50.290
But I brought gold and
my silver and I ran away

39:50.290 --> 39:52.850
To the mud

39:54.360 --> 39:56.770
It makes them forget me
for the time being

39:58.710 --> 40:01.860
What happened to our father? Then

40:01.860 --> 40:03.680
I see Joar

40:04.700 --> 40:06.700
And he is still not hurt

40:06.700 --> 40:09.340
He is still far away guarding
distance with her pursuer

40:11.250 --> 40:14.560
Before we separated, he shouted at me

40:14.560 --> 40:17.540
And he told me
to meet him here

40:18.950 --> 40:21.580
Only he and I know how to come here

40:22.460 --> 40:23.860
Well

40:24.130 --> 40:26.090
He hasn't returned yet

40:31.450 --> 40:33.770
Runa, what are you doing?

40:33.770 --> 40:36.340
I will look for him

40:36.340 --> 40:39.440
You're not going anywhere

40:39.440 --> 40:42.130
Your father knows the forest here

40:42.130 --> 40:47.130
He might just want to be sure of him
not followed before returning home

40:49.390 --> 40:50.830
Well

40:52.280 --> 40:53.910
How do we know

40:53.910 --> 40:55.870
You're telling the truth

40:55.870 --> 40:59.190
You will not betray
us and Joar when we return

40:59.190 --> 41:02.600
with the gold, you're not the chaser

41:03.080 --> 41:04.530
You are right

41:06.360 --> 41:08.730
That's wise for you
ask me that

41:09.170 --> 41:13.730
But when he returns he will
tell you, I can be trusted

41:14.410 --> 41:16.510
There is one thing you can say

41:17.630 --> 41:19.390
Swear it

41:20.140 --> 41:21.290
On your ring

41:32.910 --> 41:35.620
In the name of Thor

41:36.030 --> 41:38.060
I swear

41:38.060 --> 41:41.200
That my words are true

41:42.720 --> 41:46.950
You have to sleep and rest

41:50.670 --> 41:54.120
Bragging about yesterday,
joke about today and

41:55.160 --> 41:57.390
Forget about tomorrow

42:24.110 --> 42:26.380
What are you doing?

42:38.790 --> 42:40.550
The man is not a fool

42:50.570 --> 42:51.820
What

42:52.950 --> 42:56.200
I have to find a tree

42:56.470 --> 43:01.200
But I don't want to wake the sleeping one

43:01.200 --> 43:04.800
You don't have to do that

43:05.630 --> 43:08.700
If you were my age, you would find out

43:08.700 --> 43:12.070
Parents have to pee at night

43:12.070 --> 43:14.830
This blind parent

43:15.420 --> 43:19.600
Not much different

43:19.600 --> 43:24.600
Sleeping with women

43:25.090 --> 43:27.880
Follow me

43:36.050 --> 43:38.490
Ah

43:48.210 --> 43:49.980
Ragnvald

44:03.330 --> 44:05.830
I will save you

44:33.100 --> 44:35.250
Morning

44:36.040 --> 44:37.800
Do you feel better?

44:37.800 --> 44:40.610
Yes, thanks to you, and your family

44:41.180 --> 44:43.330
We have little to share

44:43.330 --> 44:45.490
If you can walk, you
can work for your food

44:47.030 --> 44:48.880
I will, with pleasure

44:49.220 --> 44:52.360
Good, you have to help me with my work

45:05.960 --> 45:08.430
You work hard for your family

45:12.070 --> 45:13.690
You are strong

45:14.610 --> 45:16.230
You are great

45:19.360 --> 45:21.230
Your mother

45:25.520 --> 45:27.870
You do your best

45:27.870 --> 45:32.030
He tried to keep you safe
and congratulations, I can say

45:33.500 --> 45:37.030
Yes, she's a sweet woman

45:37.800 --> 45:41.680
Kind, polite, generous

45:41.680 --> 45:44.630
It makes me laugh

45:53.540 --> 45:57.120
Sometimes I feel like an orphan

45:58.160 --> 46:00.120
Bothild continues

46:00.120 --> 46:02.250
playing and singing, but

46:02.250 --> 46:05.810
He is as lonely as me

46:06.180 --> 46:09.100
It's just that he doesn't realize it

46:11.000 --> 46:14.100
Mother changes when father leaves

46:14.100 --> 46:18.540
Sometimes when we talk, he daydreams

46:20.050 --> 46:23.400
Say nothing,
hear nothing

46:24.030 --> 46:28.400
Do you think he stopped thinking about you?

46:28.930 --> 46:33.400
No, he was just sad, and worried, and

46:33.400 --> 46:38.400
he was afraid he could not
provide for us and

46:38.400 --> 46:41.840
He was afraid I would leave him

46:44.240 --> 46:45.600
You want?

46:53.250 --> 46:55.620
Have you said anything to him?

46:58.630 --> 47:01.670
He knows I need him
to be a mother

47:04.730 --> 47:08.120
Your father tells a lot about you

47:08.930 --> 47:12.330
But he also said you
very good with arrows

47:27.010 --> 47:28.050
You're kind

47:29.900 --> 47:32.790
If you want to teach me
later, I will ...

47:32.790 --> 47:36.330
Will teach you how to use this

47:51.070 --> 47:54.760
Maybe too early, I mean
You lay a few days ago

47:57.140 --> 48:00.120
I'm not too weak to work for you

48:03.030 --> 48:06.990
I will rust like
old equipment if not exercise

48:10.360 --> 48:12.760
Long grip

48:12.760 --> 48:17.760
Yes, you don't want it to hit
your finger, and now it's ready

48:28.400 --> 48:31.300
The view, there

48:33.460 --> 48:35.830
You have the right mind for that

48:35.830 --> 48:38.950
Let go

48:47.910 --> 48:51.190
You have to be faster. Okay, fine. Again

48:57.680 --> 48:59.520
Come on

49:48.190 --> 49:51.940
Mother! Grandfather! Mom! What's wrong?

49:53.960 --> 49:55.880
Runa.What's up? Runa!

49:55.880 --> 49:57.800
What happened?

49:58.880 --> 50:01.970
What's wrong? - Can someone
say something? Bothild

50:01.970 --> 50:04.160
mother

50:41.510 --> 50:44.160
My son is back

50:48.010 --> 50:50.740
My son

50:50.740 --> 50:53.060
I feel you in my heart

50:54.310 --> 50:56.730
I know that we are back

51:05.660 --> 51:08.330
My brother

51:41.640 --> 51:44.690
Come on, come on

51:47.240 --> 51:49.970
Joar is back

51:50.760 --> 51:51.740
My love

51:51.740 --> 51:54.950
see

51:59.170 --> 52:01.240
You are okay

54:53.880 --> 54:56.720
Don't feel shy

54:56.880 --> 54:59.060
We do what we have to do

55:00.760 --> 55:04.060
You are rich You deserve it

55:07.980 --> 55:10.540
More than ever will

55:11.030 --> 55:13.100
It should feel like relief

55:13.670 --> 55:15.250
For you and your family

55:17.070 --> 55:19.050
And you saved my life

55:21.070 --> 55:23.300
When the arrows fly

55:23.300 --> 55:26.940
I've never seen archery like
that, you should be proud of it

55:27.510 --> 55:30.330
I believe he needs
calmness and peace

55:31.940 --> 55:32.760
Well

55:42.890 --> 55:46.440
How do you feel? You look pale

56:56.230 --> 56:57.660
You're alone

56:59.180 --> 57:02.660
Something seemed to frighten the animal

57:06.770 --> 57:09.790
Dad seems different

57:10.840 --> 57:12.620
You feel?

57:12.950 --> 57:14.380
Yes

57:14.380 --> 57:18.820
Something is bothering him.
He just returned home

57:18.820 --> 57:21.440
He went through a lot
thing, he's very tired

57:21.440 --> 57:24.810
There are others. How do you know

57:27.700 --> 57:29.700
I do not know yet

58:03.290 --> 58:04.610
Joar

58:15.020 --> 58:16.730
You have to talk

58:18.250 --> 58:22.510
You can't help you, if you are
don't tell me what's wrong

58:27.940 --> 58:30.190
Why do you want to be alone?

58:30.190 --> 58:32.940
When your family misses you so much

58:35.850 --> 58:37.940
Thank you

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.620
best defense

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:39.600
Is to know your enemy's weapons

01:01:40.610 --> 01:01:43.220
Now you try, hold my leg

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:47.920
Look, you're open, you need to be faster

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.220
Not done yet, come on

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:56.060
OK, come on

01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:01.060
You have to defend yourself.
Come on, come on

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:06.060
Torulf

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.060
How is your wound?

01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:12.910
Getting better every day

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.650
Nice

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.360
We want you to pay us now

01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:25.400
You understand we have to
united as a family

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:29.560
And you need to rest

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:32.230
And forget your adventures

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:36.210
I hope you understand brother

01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:40.350
I understand

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.560
You lost your shadow of treasure

01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:04.780
But you have not lost your friend

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:16.180
I haven't told you

01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:31.910
Yes, fine, my friend

01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:35.350
You will return this winter

01:03:35.350 --> 01:03:40.350
For good drinks and old stories

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:43.850
I have no doubt that

01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:46.790
My friend

01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:51.100
Can't believe he kicked you out

01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:55.160
You haven't fully recovered yet
worry about me

01:03:56.350 --> 01:03:58.230
OK

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:10.030
I hope we meet soon

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:14.900
You teach me to master the arrows

01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:17.550
You need two good hands for that

01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.550
In due time, in due time

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:22.360
Brother, you're back

01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:25.030
Hello

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.540
Runa, is it not?

01:05:45.540 --> 01:05:48.710
Sigrun

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:53.130
Is your family here too? Yes

01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:55.950
Yes, they exist

01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:59.960
I have not heard from
who travels

01:06:00.510 --> 01:06:04.160
Your father? Is he back?
Is she alright?

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:09.160
Yes, he's back. That's good news

01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:13.130
It must be good not to be alone
in the forest anymore

01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:17.720
I heard that the forest supports your family

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:21.130
Maybe things will change now

01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:24.410
Is Joar lucky?
with this trip?

01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:28.410
No, not really

01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:30.400
At least he returned

01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:35.400
There is what I want you
meet, you remember my son

01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:40.810
Has grown into a handsome young man

01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:44.800
He will get her before another woman

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.170
Take this again

01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:39.860
Bird

01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:41.740
They die

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:44.910
In the whole plant

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:48.790
But the worst is the smell

01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:52.180
Like stomach contents and vomit

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.530
Rotten meat

01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:57.650
I almost threw up

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:02.960
I also saw that
strange too, far north

01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:07.050
Like there is someone on
the trees are watching us

01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:10.850
He has a husband with him, at
arm a good spear

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.060
Don't make the smell go away

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:19.300
Say nothing,
still there watching

01:08:22.450 --> 01:08:25.340
That must be one of those Christian priests

01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:28.240
They are indeed strange

01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:30.920
And they rarely make love, I hear

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.370
That is not a priest

01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:37.930
Both sister and her husband are scared,
they are not easily frightened

01:08:37.930 --> 01:08:41.790
Suddenly her husband stood directing
spear and frighten them

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:45.540
But he slowly slowly
turn his back

01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:48.490
Wait

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.920
What happened?

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:56.100
It is still there

01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:58.939
That's crazy

01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:02.399
and smells like this

01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:04.080
Smell?

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:10.100
Like he rot

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:13.200
Like he rot

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:37.820
Who is there?

01:12:50.430 --> 01:12:52.650
Want to dance

01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:54.720
Yes

01:12:59.260 --> 01:13:01.290
The fire is extinguished

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:07.680
Someone has been here

01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:21.920
They are back
You're talking about Ragnvald

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:25.620
Can it be a criminal or a thief
try to steal the gold

01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:29.500
They smell bad, I almost threw up

01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:32.010
They are silent

01:13:32.010 --> 01:13:35.410
They didn't try to break in

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:38.260
I was drunk when I was
pissed in my pants

01:13:38.490 --> 01:13:40.040
Is she alone?

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.640
I didn't even know that
man or not.

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:45.140
Maybe not human at all

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:49.550
Don't talk like that Ragnvald,
it's unlucky, it's gotta be an animal

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:52.220
No, no

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.390
I already know

01:13:56.700 --> 01:13:58.890
We have to look around

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:31.940
This

01:15:44.270 --> 01:15:46.350
Why don't you eat

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:51.720
I have to get out

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.280
Father

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:18.630
My strong daughter

01:16:20.570 --> 01:16:22.540
I have something you
don't tell us

01:16:25.940 --> 01:16:27.710
Why don't you live with us?

01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:34.080
I want my father back

01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:37.260
- Not a stupid bag of gold. - not gold

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.780
Soil

01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:43.360
I need to take this risk Runa

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:48.780
There is no future here for you or
your sister, roaming in this forest like

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:52.380
Wolf and bear. Now
we have a bag of gold

01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:55.490
But you say so

01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:04.570
I know you

01:17:04.570 --> 01:17:07.410
I knew something was up
you didn't tell me

01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:12.640
I am wrong

01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:16.560
Take from the grave

01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:22.830
Maybe it's only in my head

01:17:23.890 --> 01:17:25.770
Like this

01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:30.770
Feel better with it

01:17:33.690 --> 01:17:35.500
We have time

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:40.810
He is gone

01:20:11.970 --> 01:20:13.590
Father gave me

01:20:18.590 --> 01:20:20.130
Don't lose it

01:20:26.790 --> 01:20:28.530
It will return

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:07.320
Where Bothild

01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:11.470
I do not know

01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:15.070
Bothild!

01:21:21.490 --> 01:21:22.910
Bothild!

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.460
Bothild!

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:09.430
Run

01:24:27.530 --> 01:24:30.330
Isn't Runa here? I don't know

01:24:31.330 --> 01:24:34.700
Bothild! are you hurt?

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:37.070
What happened? What happened?

01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:40.270
They are close

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:43.100
Your ship friend? / My ship friend

01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.450
We have to go. Go? Where is Joar?

01:24:45.450 --> 01:24:50.230
He left
us. Go? With that gold

01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:53.260
He will give them

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:58.260
I gave them my gold,
they don't care

01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:02.130
There. Bring it here. What?

01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:06.010
They will get it

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:10.510
I killed one of
them. There are more

01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:13.110
Now they will leave
will take everything you have

01:25:13.110 --> 01:25:14.600
But this ... Won't stop them,

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:17.050
that's why you have to go
before they gather together

01:25:17.050 --> 01:25:18.500
They have a bad odor

01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:22.370
You two go inside now

01:25:22.370 --> 01:25:25.620
I think they came

01:25:26.650 --> 01:25:29.090
This is crazy

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:34.090
I want to defend and fight,
but now we must be wise

01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:38.780
Bring a spear

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:53.020
This is like this

01:26:28.770 --> 01:26:31.850
We must prepare the weapons

01:26:34.150 --> 01:26:38.010
We all need to get drunk
many them? A dozen?

01:26:40.270 --> 01:26:44.140
- What should you mean?

01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:47.890
We cannot win

01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.180
We can survive this

01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:52.910
We can make them leave

01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:55.350
We have nothing left

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:01.070
I think they already know us
no more treasure

01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:05.400
They want revenge
revenge for what?

01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:08.580
Thank you

01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:12.420
He took care of me for almost 2 years

01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:16.790
She's a friend

01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:19.840
Fuck them! They never stop!

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:22.930
Can't hear anything

01:27:22.930 --> 01:27:26.560
Why? - Talk. - No!

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:29.880
- Don't say it. - I saw him dead Runa

01:27:31.210 --> 01:27:35.180
On the mountain, in the morning after
we found the treasure

01:27:36.090 --> 01:27:38.950
He was cut, and he
no way to live

01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:42.040
They are not good

01:27:45.860 --> 01:27:47.600
They are creatures

01:27:48.750 --> 01:27:50.540
They are undead

01:27:56.210 --> 01:27:57.920
I can not hear them

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:02.170
Are they gone? Dad. They are not

01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:07.390
Maybe he's still alive. Maybe
he saw what they were, and ran

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:20.960
How can he find
walk here. That's the treasure

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.370
They feel it

01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:28.150
What can save us

01:28:28.150 --> 01:28:31.350
What happened

01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.890
Bothild

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:41.200
Please help

01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:45.310
If they are human, they are
it's burning now

01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:50.220
They don't want us to get away easily

01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:53.530
Don't talk about it in front of Bothild

01:30:01.780 --> 01:30:04.470
We can put the ring outside the door

01:30:07.370 --> 01:30:10.830
Close your eyes and don't get far from me

01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:14.280
Soon you will wake up near God

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:16.860
Your father will be there

01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:19.500
Waiting for us

01:30:28.230 --> 01:30:30.060
Varhala

01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:32.580
Sit at Odin's table

01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:35.620
It will enjoy it

01:30:39.420 --> 01:30:42.310
They will be many

01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:45.080
There is nothing to be afraid of

01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:47.670
It will be over soon

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.130
They want to

01:30:51.250 --> 01:30:54.860
You know that

01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:58.570
And with God, there is music

01:30:58.570 --> 01:31:03.420
It will sing a good song

01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:07.010
And there is more

01:31:07.010 --> 01:31:09.500
didn't solve it

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:24.030
You will know I love you

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:28.520
You have to get out through
back door now

01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:44.640
I cannot leave you
- my brother. - Go with him

01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:49.260
I'll save a nice seat for you

01:32:09.490 --> 01:32:12.750
In the name of god I will die fighting

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.400
- Grandfather. - He wants to divert for everyone

01:32:46.570 --> 01:32:50.170
Hurry up, where is the gold? Where is it?

01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:56.330
I am sorry

01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:00.210
This is harder for you

01:33:01.210 --> 01:33:02.840
Where did you get it?

01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:05.700
Father gave me

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:12.320
Hide Bothild

01:34:22.890 --> 01:34:26.150
Run! Bothild! Run! Run!

01:34:26.150 --> 01:34:28.070
Bothild run!

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:44.300
Back off!

01:35:08.020 --> 01:35:11.310
Come on

01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:59.000
Bothild run!

01:35:59.830 --> 01:36:01.180
Runa!

01:36:01.650 --> 01:36:05.930
Go with him, we will
hold it in! I can't lose you

01:36:06.210 --> 01:36:07.820
I will be fine

01:37:07.890 --> 01:37:10.710
No

01:37:11.220 --> 01:37:13.650
No!

01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:00.990
Mother, we will face
they are, and we will follow

01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:04.880
But we will be like father

01:39:05.660 --> 01:39:10.340
I will be there

01:39:14.330 --> 01:39:18.360
Bring this spear. - Don't leave it
he is out of control

01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:23.320
Don't let him get out of control

01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:26.220
I coming

01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:27.960
We will get you out

01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:58.960
Joar

01:41:02.690 --> 01:41:04.090
Joar

01:41:41.310 --> 01:41:44.930
He knows that, but you know what it means

01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:55.930
