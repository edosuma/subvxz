WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.510
Previously on Empire...
Empire XStream--

00:09.543 --> 00:11.045
we are taking over the world!

00:11.079 --> 00:12.980
I do the music,
you handle the business,

00:13.013 --> 00:14.648
and we stay out
of each other's way.

00:14.682 --> 00:15.916
I know you're working
on the Black & White album.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.051
I'm shelving it.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.319
African-American men,

00:18.352 --> 00:20.354
the primary victims
in gun violence.

00:20.388 --> 00:22.090
If anybody's a victim,
it's Freda Gatz.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.357
I'm Zeah, Mr. Lyon.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.692
I'm gonna be an MC,
just like you.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.860
Cookie, you should come down
to the center sometime.

00:26.894 --> 00:29.330
I can't get onstage.
I can't do it no more.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.899
You got one job in this house
and that's a mother.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.001
Tariq, he may be
your half brother,

00:34.034 --> 00:35.203
but he is not your friend.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.171
Step away from the car.
Sir, I live right there.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.872
(grunting)

00:47.381 --> 00:48.782
Hey, Lucious.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.017
Can we talk?

00:50.050 --> 00:52.653
LUCIOUS:
Door is open. Come on in.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.959
Hey.

00:58.992 --> 01:02.530
You still, uh, obsessing
over these streaming numbers?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.064
Well, the board
has determined

01:04.098 --> 01:06.634
that if I don't get to
ten million subscribers

01:06.667 --> 01:08.402
by Thursday,
they want to pull the plug

01:08.436 --> 01:11.071
which means
I lose $50 million.

01:11.105 --> 01:12.440
What's on your mind?

01:12.473 --> 01:13.974
I'm like a prisoner
in this house.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.944
Come on, with nothing
to look forward to.

01:16.977 --> 01:19.713
You call looking after
my granddaughter nothing?

01:19.747 --> 01:21.315
You ain't gonna get
much sympathy

01:21.349 --> 01:23.884
from anybody about this shack
you calling a prison.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.886
No, that's not what I mean,
Lucious.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.122
Look, I know that we have
had our differences,

01:28.156 --> 01:31.425
but, I know that Cookie's
looking for a new head of A&R.

01:31.459 --> 01:34.395
And you know that that is
never going to happen,

01:34.428 --> 01:35.896
so you need to just...

01:35.929 --> 01:37.298
Lucious?

01:39.167 --> 01:40.501
Are you okay?

01:40.534 --> 01:41.902
(exhales shakily)

01:41.935 --> 01:43.171
Oh, my God, do you need me
to call a doctor?

01:44.138 --> 01:46.640
(woman gasps)
Mm.

01:46.674 --> 01:49.076
No, I looked everywhere

01:49.109 --> 01:50.478
and I couldn't find my earring
under there.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.112
Damn.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.415
Maybe you can look
for it later.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.251
Oh, Pia, you remember
your old boss,

01:57.285 --> 01:59.320
Anika.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.354
I like your assistant.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.522
Pia, will you be a doll

02:01.555 --> 02:02.990
and get Cho in here?

02:03.023 --> 02:06.026
I need to see the new
Empire XStream artwork.

02:06.059 --> 02:09.230
Keep putting your back
into that work of yours.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.766
Ooh.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.370
Look what I found.
(laughing)

02:20.541 --> 02:22.543
(chuckles)

02:23.811 --> 02:26.180
*

02:30.818 --> 02:32.986
LUCIOUS: I mean, Empire XStream
is bleeding out.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.356
Our main asset
is exclusive content

02:35.389 --> 02:36.357
and I don't have it.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.791
I need five new songs

02:37.825 --> 02:39.126
by the end of this week.
Man,

02:39.159 --> 02:41.962
I cannot get you five new songs
by the end of this...

02:41.995 --> 02:42.963
What is that?

02:42.996 --> 02:43.964
LUCIOUS:
Incentive.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.033
You are gonna give
a car to whoever

02:46.066 --> 02:48.969
can deliver a new song that's
ready to drop by this Friday.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.405
And while you're at it,
tell your son

02:51.439 --> 02:53.241
that I'm releasing his
Black & White album.

02:53.274 --> 02:56.244
Jamal does not want that album
released, Lucious.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.678
He done told you that
a million times.

02:57.711 --> 02:58.746
Well, I don't care.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.180
He can tell me a million more.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.515
Look, Cookie,
if you with me

03:01.549 --> 03:03.384
with this business, 50/50,

03:03.417 --> 03:04.985
then you're gonna get me
those songs.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.988
Okay. Sure.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.424
I'll get on it tomorrow,
after my lunch with Angelo.

03:10.458 --> 03:13.227
What are you seeing
in that Oreo, anyway?

03:13.261 --> 03:15.763
I'm being proactive
in the community.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.999
I'm going to meet some of the
WOKE kids from his foundation.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.769
So he can warm your heart with
how good he is with these kids.

03:21.802 --> 03:24.472
He might warm something else
later. (chuckles)

03:26.240 --> 03:27.441
Everything's under control, Mom.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.109
MAN:
He's coming out!

03:29.142 --> 03:30.611
Yeah, I-I got...
I got Max with me.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.746
(crowd clamoring)
Max Perkins.

03:32.780 --> 03:34.682
WOMAN: Andre!
MAN: Can we get a comment,
please?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.049
WOMAN:
Over here, please!

03:36.083 --> 03:37.518
Over here!
Andre Lyon!

03:37.551 --> 03:39.287
Mr. Lyon, can you tell us
what happened?

03:41.054 --> 03:42.723
Okay, okay.

03:42.756 --> 03:45.459
Do exactly what we discussed
a few minutes ago.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.227
Don't go all "Black Lives
Matter" on me here, okay?

03:47.261 --> 03:49.062
We're good. Let's go.

03:49.096 --> 03:51.765
(reporters clamoring)

03:51.799 --> 03:53.634
This was all a simple
misunderstanding.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.035
My client has fully cooperated
with law enforcement,

03:55.068 --> 03:56.537
it will all be cleared up

03:56.570 --> 03:58.205
in a matter of days. Thank you.
Your mother and father

03:58.238 --> 03:59.573
have a checkered history
with law enforcement.

03:59.607 --> 04:00.708
Are you just following
in their criminal footsteps?

04:00.741 --> 04:02.142
That's all for now.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.044
My client won't be making
any statements. Thank you.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.480
So, are you a gangster now,
too, Andre?

04:12.085 --> 04:13.587
What happened to me
is what's happening

04:13.621 --> 04:15.289
all across America, right now.

04:15.323 --> 04:16.690
WOMAN:
And what's that?

04:20.093 --> 04:22.630
Hey, babe.

04:22.663 --> 04:25.466
Answer her.
Come on, she's waiting.

04:25.499 --> 04:28.168
We both know that none of this
would have happened

04:28.201 --> 04:30.137
if I was still here.

04:36.644 --> 04:39.413
MAN: I went back to the bar
where it went down,

04:39.447 --> 04:41.148
like you all told me to.

04:41.181 --> 04:43.784
I took my new lady with me.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.454
As soon as we hit the door,
I start shaking.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.455
But you did the breathing?

04:47.488 --> 04:48.989
Yeah.
And?

04:49.022 --> 04:50.858
I'm still here.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.768
You all noticed, we have
someone new in group today.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.135
This is Jamal...

05:02.169 --> 05:03.303
Jamal Lyon.

05:03.337 --> 05:04.338
Jamal...

05:04.372 --> 05:05.939
we ask new people to

05:05.973 --> 05:07.775
tell the group what caused
their PTSD.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.010
WOMAN: Everybody knows
what happened to Jamal.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.045
They played it over and over
again on the news.

05:12.079 --> 05:14.147
LEADER:
That doesn't matter.

05:14.181 --> 05:16.116
Your fame just creates another
barrier for your recovery

05:16.149 --> 05:17.551
because you have
to face your trauma

05:17.585 --> 05:19.687
in front of the world.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.988
It's still PTSD.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.390
Yeah, I'm good.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.891
Um, it's my first time,

05:23.924 --> 05:25.225
so I'm probably just gonna,
you know,

05:25.258 --> 05:26.360
lay low and listen.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.261
But thank you.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.531
Okay.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.033
Hey, Jamal. Hey! Hey.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.803
Look, what happened inside,
that wasn't cool.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.204
That's not how we do things.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.172
(clears throat)
They all know what happened,

05:39.206 --> 05:40.808
so it's no sense in frontin'
like they don't.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.175
Let me ask you something, man.

05:42.209 --> 05:43.544
Are you still taking
any pain meds?

05:43.577 --> 05:45.012
Yeah.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.581
I was hoping to be off of them
by now, but, um,

05:47.615 --> 05:49.517
I'm not, so...

05:49.550 --> 05:50.551
It's nothing to be
ashamed about.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.919
When a soldier gets shot...

05:51.952 --> 05:53.387
I'm not a soldier.

05:53.421 --> 05:55.022
You were in
the military, right?

05:55.055 --> 05:56.824
Um, Major Philip Barrett?
You got shot.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.660
Your PTSD is no less
significant than mine.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.596
If you need treatment, man...

06:02.630 --> 06:05.666
Um, I came here, you know,
just to...

06:05.699 --> 06:07.067
kind of, test the waters.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.069
And, uh, it actually worked.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.370
A lot, you know?
All right.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.672
And at this point,
I kind of feel like

06:11.705 --> 06:13.574
I know how to manage this.
Which is, it's great.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.643
And that's... that's 'cause
of y'all, so thank you.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.315
Andre!

06:23.383 --> 06:24.718
Hey. Oh.

06:24.752 --> 06:26.687
Let me guess:
it was a white cop.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.221
I should've been smarter
about it, okay?

06:28.255 --> 06:29.389
I know this whole thing
could've turned out

06:29.423 --> 06:30.724
a whole lot differently.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.560
I wouldn't be standing here
with you today, I know.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.728
Nothing you could
have done different.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.430
You were born black.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.698
What happened, Andre?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.066
I was clearing out
me and Rhonda's apartment,

06:39.099 --> 06:41.068
a cop shows up and...
Mm-hmm.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.437
Look, I gave him attitude.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.138
No, I don't want to hear that!
That's some B.S.!

06:45.172 --> 06:46.373
Look,

06:46.406 --> 06:48.075
I'm-a make Thirsty

06:48.108 --> 06:49.309
take care of these cops.
Yeah.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.744
Thirsty?
Let him look into these charges!

06:50.778 --> 06:52.446
Pop, I-I don't need Thirsty,
okay?

06:52.480 --> 06:53.747
I got my own lawyer.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.983
With the FBI watching
our every move,

06:56.016 --> 06:57.217
the last thing we need

06:57.250 --> 06:59.319
is Thirsty taking care
of anything.

06:59.352 --> 07:01.555
I-I just want to do this
the right way.

07:01.589 --> 07:05.225
(scoffs) Andre,
the right way...

07:05.258 --> 07:07.928
You do realize you're
a black man, right, Andre?

07:09.362 --> 07:12.232
And that was a dirty cop
that did that to your face.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.903
And since this was not caught
on video, it is your word

07:15.936 --> 07:17.437
against theirs,
all right?

07:17.471 --> 07:19.172
No, see, the police
messed up this time.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.407
They done messed
with the wrong ones.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.308
So, we gonna fight fire
with fire!

07:21.341 --> 07:22.810
Enough!

07:24.311 --> 07:25.846
(sighs)

07:28.115 --> 07:29.717
I'm a Wharton graduate, Mama.

07:31.284 --> 07:36.624
I'm a CFO of a publically traded
corporation.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.258
I'm not gonna fight fire
with fire.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.459
Andre...

07:39.493 --> 07:41.328
I'm not doing it!
(door opens)

07:44.532 --> 07:46.900
That boy is headed
for a world of trouble.

07:54.341 --> 07:57.277
(indistinct chatter)

07:57.310 --> 07:59.547
MAN:
Raymond Lewis, aka Gram.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.515
Tiana Brown's new boyfriend--
ran with the Uptown Mafia

08:01.549 --> 08:03.651
for a minute,
now he's a rapper.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.452
WOMAN:
Can I get a selfie?

08:05.485 --> 08:07.454
TARIQ: When you get inside,
see if he's still affiliated.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.322
(squealing)
Anything we can get on him,

08:09.356 --> 08:11.659
we might be able to use
against the Lyons.

08:13.894 --> 08:16.630
You want a selfie? No?

08:16.664 --> 08:19.299
I have no idea who that one is.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.334
Porsha Taylor,
Cookie Lyon's assistant.

08:21.368 --> 08:22.502
Don't waste your time.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.237
So, don't nobody know who I am?

08:24.271 --> 08:26.239
Nobody knows Porsha?

08:26.273 --> 08:28.742
That's cool. That's cool.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.477
I got a question, sir.

08:30.510 --> 08:34.047
Lucious Lyon was cleared
of all charges last year.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.315
What's this really about?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.416
Lyon beat the case

08:36.449 --> 08:38.351
because it was mishandled.

08:38.385 --> 08:40.253
All I have to do now is
build a new case

08:40.287 --> 08:42.089
based on
new charges.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.091
Knowing Lucious Lyon
the way I do,

08:44.124 --> 08:47.094
I have plenty to choose from.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.896
(crowd cheering)

08:48.929 --> 08:52.600
*

08:57.304 --> 09:00.373
COOKIE:
Yes! Tiana, girl!

09:00.407 --> 09:02.175
* Anytime any day, yeah
* Yeah *

09:02.209 --> 09:04.411

09:14.387 --> 09:15.355
GRAM:

09:17.490 --> 09:19.359

09:19.392 --> 09:20.360
* Call me any hour

09:20.393 --> 09:22.095
I didn't know Gram

09:22.129 --> 09:24.431

tonight. Did you?

09:24.464 --> 09:26.700

09:46.119 --> 09:48.989
COOKIE:
Ooh, Hakeem is not happy.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.824
Damn, son, you look
worse than I did

09:50.858 --> 09:52.225
when I was dying from ALS.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.393
Thanks, Dad.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.895
I thought you went
to the doctors today.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.564
I went to a, um, PTSD group.

09:57.597 --> 09:58.565
PTSD?
It was stupid.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.133
Don't worry about it.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.335
Yeah, I could have saved you
the time if you had asked me.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.271
Look, the only thing that's
gonna fix your problem

10:04.304 --> 10:06.239
is get your ass back
on that stage.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.607
JAMAL: I'm going
into the studio next week.

10:07.641 --> 10:09.142
I'm gonna record some new stuff.

10:09.176 --> 10:12.079
Being in the studio ain't
the same as being on the stage.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.847
If you don't give these fans
something to look at,

10:13.881 --> 10:15.482
you're gonna lose 'em.

10:15.515 --> 10:18.118
You gonna be all right, Jamal.
Shut up.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.620
* See yeah
* What I see *

10:20.654 --> 10:22.255
* And I know you know this
where you wanna be, yeah *

10:22.289 --> 10:24.925
* Now, baby, let me love you,
love you long time *

10:24.958 --> 10:26.626
* Long time *
* I can, I can love you

10:26.660 --> 10:27.828
* Love you long time
* Long time *

10:27.861 --> 10:29.797
* Imma put it on you,
on you on time *

10:29.830 --> 10:31.198
* Oh, yeah *
* No one can do it

10:31.231 --> 10:35.102
* The way you do it, yeah.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.971
(crowd cheering)

10:42.475 --> 10:43.476
MAN:
Yeah!

10:48.548 --> 10:50.350
(grunts)
Man!

10:50.383 --> 10:51.785
Listen, I know that
he's foul, or whatever,

10:51.819 --> 10:53.320
but you need to just
forget about it.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.956
I'm-a beat his ass, man.
That's my girl, man!

10:55.989 --> 10:58.358
Had me an affair one.
That ain't your girl.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.293
That's my girl!
Since when is it
your girl, Hakeem.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.494
Now, calm your ass down,
'cause fighting

11:01.528 --> 11:02.963
ain't never helped nothing.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.564
Your brother's
absolutely right.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.900
It's pointless to clap
back at Gram cracker

11:06.934 --> 11:08.969
unless you're
gonna finish him.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.670
You're the Lyon,
he's not.

11:10.704 --> 11:13.373
Why don't you spit some
napalm on a diss track,

11:13.406 --> 11:16.844
and bury him and
everything he cares about?

11:16.877 --> 11:18.746
Y'all go ahead
and do that.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.917
See, if you've got something
you want to say to someone,

11:23.951 --> 11:26.920
let the world
hear you say it.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.193
WOMAN: So, Randal, what I'm
gonna need from you is...

11:33.226 --> 11:34.594
Mom, no. I--

11:34.627 --> 11:36.429
COOKIE (laughing)
Get your ass in here.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.432
Wait. Seriously, Kitty?
How did you do this?

11:39.466 --> 11:41.068
Look, boy, don't you
question how I make

11:41.101 --> 11:42.669
my black girl
magic happen.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.072
I'm gonna cure you
of this PTSD.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.673
Okay, you ready?
All right.
Okay.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.041
Kitty!

11:48.075 --> 11:50.043
Baby, come on down

11:50.077 --> 11:51.845
with your fabulous self--
look at you!

11:51.879 --> 11:53.180
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.581
These shoes.

11:54.614 --> 11:56.016
(laughs)

11:56.049 --> 11:58.585
Girl, ain't nothing changed.
Look at you!

11:58.618 --> 12:00.420
Mwah!
You look gorgeous,
as always.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.089
And look at this.
Nah...

12:02.122 --> 12:03.757
Oh, stop.
I...

12:03.791 --> 12:05.425
don't even know
what to say right now.

12:05.458 --> 12:08.428
Un, well, I think you should
say yes, right, Kitty?

12:08.461 --> 12:10.463
Yes. Yes, yes.

12:10.497 --> 12:13.300
Yes.
Uh...
Hell... yes.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.601
What did...
(chuckles)
(laughing)

12:14.634 --> 12:16.269
What did I just
say yes to?

12:16.303 --> 12:17.871
I don't care, but...

12:17.905 --> 12:19.472
Uh, well, Kitty,
why don't you tell him.

12:19.506 --> 12:23.243
Okay. So this
beautiful lady, your mom,

12:23.276 --> 12:25.712
had an idea--
I'm here rehearsing.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.815
Getting ready to go
on a South American tour,

12:27.848 --> 12:29.416
and I want you with me,

12:29.449 --> 12:31.318
because we found a song
that's perfect for us.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.887
I just want to sing with you,
and I think it would be amazing.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.990
It's hot, Jamal.
It's hot!

12:37.024 --> 12:38.992
I...

12:39.026 --> 12:43.096
I'm not really performing
right now... just yet.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.502
Um... okay.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.571
I'm gonna go back
to rehearsal.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.273
Yeah, just let me talk
to him for a second.
Just call me when-- Yeah.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.009
No, no, no, let me talk to him
for a second. Come here!

12:56.043 --> 12:57.477
Get your stupid ass...

12:57.510 --> 13:00.313
Well...
Watch your step.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.581
Boy, your father was right.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.283
The number of
performance requests

13:03.316 --> 13:07.120
I'm getting for you
has dropped to half.

13:07.154 --> 13:09.322
I ain't ready yet,
all right?

13:09.356 --> 13:10.958
I'm not.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.359
(sighs)
Look...

13:12.392 --> 13:14.527
Kitty even said
we have the live rights

13:14.561 --> 13:17.364
to Empire XStream, okay?

13:17.397 --> 13:19.532
And I thought that would
keep your father

13:19.566 --> 13:22.035
off of releasing that
Black & White album of yours.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.907
All right.
Kitty...

13:29.142 --> 13:31.611
I have a proposition
for you.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.214
Okay.

13:35.748 --> 13:39.519
Wait... you want me to
record for Empire?

13:40.820 --> 13:42.355
You didn't think
I brought you here

13:42.389 --> 13:44.057
to have tea, did you?

13:44.091 --> 13:46.559
Look, I caught your
performance at the summit.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.161
It's about the only thing
that kept me awake

13:48.195 --> 13:49.963
during them
boring-ass speeches, so

13:49.997 --> 13:52.732
unless you think
Angelo's gonna mind...

13:56.403 --> 13:59.406
I don't think so.
Good, son.

13:59.439 --> 14:00.673
Let's go make some music.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.414
(door closes)
Dad...

14:07.447 --> 14:09.216
now, I specifically said
that the Black & White album

14:09.249 --> 14:10.583
is not to be released.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.585
Yeah, well, Empire spent
a whole lot of money

14:12.619 --> 14:14.521
on that joint, and
we need to recoup.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.757
Besides that,
Empire XStream needs it.

14:17.790 --> 14:21.561
Oh, God, do you ever not
mention Empire XStream?

14:21.594 --> 14:23.363
It happens to be
a ravenous beast

14:23.396 --> 14:25.498
that is the lifeblood
of this company.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.434
So if we don't
feed it some content,

14:27.467 --> 14:29.536
it's gonna consume each
and every one of us.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.837
JAMAL:
Okay, we get it.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.039
You are a vampire.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.273
(chuckles)

14:33.306 --> 14:35.342
So let me bring you
a freshly slit vein

14:35.375 --> 14:37.710
for your liking--
Kitty.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.880
Delicious.
Keep bleeding.

14:40.914 --> 14:43.616
She agreed to record
a duet with me,

14:43.650 --> 14:45.552
and live-stream the session
as exclusive content

14:45.585 --> 14:46.886
to Empire XStream.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.855
Wow, a collaboration
like that would bring in

14:48.888 --> 14:50.623
a whole lot
of subscriptions.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.392
JAMAL:
Yes, it would.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.461
So...

14:54.494 --> 14:56.463
the Black & White
album.

14:58.465 --> 14:59.632
Dead.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.068
Thank you, sir.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.236
(chuckles)
Thank you.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.305
And you're welcome.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.542
Very nice.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.211
Is that all you
think about?

15:11.244 --> 15:14.481
Crunching numbers
and bottom lines?

15:14.514 --> 15:16.783
What else is left
for me, Cookie?

15:16.816 --> 15:19.252
(chuckles)

15:19.286 --> 15:22.589
Jamal was right.
You are a vampire.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.424
Then why don't you let me
suck on some of your blood?

15:24.457 --> 15:26.626
Drop dead, Lucious.

15:26.659 --> 15:27.727
I can't.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.063
I'm a vampire.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.632
* Ha, you-you be
blowing up her line cuz *

15:32.665 --> 15:34.767
* She be throwing me that
* She be throwing me that *

15:34.801 --> 15:36.669
Yeah, he embodying her.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.839
SHINE: Tiana gonna trip out
on this... come on.

15:39.872 --> 15:42.009
* Yeah, that's-that's
ya new thing *

15:42.042 --> 15:43.010
* Boy, that's old work
* Old work

15:43.043 --> 15:44.144
* And you ain't know

15:44.177 --> 15:45.478
* Shoulda did ya homework

15:45.512 --> 15:47.180
* And I ain't even mad at ya

15:47.214 --> 15:50.183
* 'Cause I could still
hit that *

15:50.217 --> 15:52.752
You beastin', Hakeem.
That's it.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.154
Now we just need
the hook.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.023
It's legendary.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.992
Nessa, you ready?
Not really, Shine.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.627
I mean, are we really
about to do this?
Yeah.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.162
What are you talking about?
I'm really about to go in here

16:02.195 --> 16:03.530
and talk about this girl?

16:03.563 --> 16:05.165
What's the matter?

16:05.198 --> 16:06.866
(sighs)
I get it.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.635
You mad at your ex, Keem.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.437
But disrespecting her
is not my jam.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.139
No, your jam is
in that booth.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.906
Now, get your ass
in there and sing.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.847
Who you looking at crazy!

16:20.880 --> 16:23.316
Yo, man, chill!

16:23.350 --> 16:25.152
(gasping)

16:28.721 --> 16:29.889
Nessa, come here.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.864
(door slams)
Wow, really?

16:45.338 --> 16:48.541
LUCIOUS: So Shine
laid hands on Nessa,

16:48.575 --> 16:50.377
'cause she didn't want
to do the hook?

16:50.410 --> 16:52.145
And?
Dad, he just

16:52.179 --> 16:53.880
put his hands
on her for no reason.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.083
Are you sleeping with her?
What?

16:56.116 --> 16:57.250
No, I ain't sleeping
with her.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.086
Then it ain't your fight.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.654
Look...

17:01.688 --> 17:03.690
the way I see it,
Shine was trying

17:03.723 --> 17:05.758
to get me something
that I need,

17:05.792 --> 17:07.327
which is a hot song.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.761
So instead of you
running in here

17:08.795 --> 17:10.263
ratting him out
like a little bitch,

17:10.297 --> 17:11.931
you need to be
taking notes.

17:11.964 --> 17:15.368
I mean, what in the hell
happened to that monster

17:15.402 --> 17:17.036
who tried to take
his father out

17:17.070 --> 17:18.571
and rule his throne?

17:18.605 --> 17:20.607
Hmm? Where he at?

17:20.640 --> 17:22.609
I ain't choking no girl.

17:22.642 --> 17:23.810
That's bitch tendencies.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.379
Where he at?

17:26.413 --> 17:28.648
He never left.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.419
'Cause that's who
I want to see raising Bella.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.787
Your song don't work

17:34.821 --> 17:37.290
without a female voice
for the hook.

17:37.324 --> 17:40.693
So I don't know what the hell
you're doing standing here.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.929
You need to get me
that song.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.772
I just saw Juanita
holding Bella.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.707
Aren't you supposed
to be looking after her?

17:54.741 --> 17:57.777
Aren't you supposed
to be sedated... or dead?

17:57.810 --> 18:01.581
My mama used to stick pins
in a voodoo doll

18:01.614 --> 18:03.416
that looked
just like you.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.617
(doorbell rings)

18:04.651 --> 18:05.785
Excuse me.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.755
I will go get it.
(sighs)

18:11.591 --> 18:13.092
Hi.
Hi.

18:13.126 --> 18:14.794
Delivery for
Mrs. Lucious Lyon.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.130
Oh, yeah, that's me.
Thanks.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.600
Perfect.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.972
Thank you.
Thank you.

18:36.283 --> 18:37.784
God...

18:42.222 --> 18:44.957
Mr. Dubois?

18:44.991 --> 18:46.793
Oh, there you are.

18:46.826 --> 18:47.860
Hey!

18:47.894 --> 18:50.062
Hey.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.534
So, what, a black kid's life
is worth

18:54.567 --> 18:55.802
a couple of bucks
and a car?

18:55.835 --> 18:56.969
What?

18:59.038 --> 19:00.607
This...

19:00.640 --> 19:03.109
This young man
barely escapes with his life.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.145
He's on his way to MIT,
full scholarship.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.780
And you want him to
throw all that out

19:07.814 --> 19:09.882
for a contract
to be a rapper?

19:09.916 --> 19:12.719
The world doesn't need
another rapper.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.487
Lucious...

19:14.521 --> 19:17.990
Lucious did that so that
you could be pissed at me.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.158
What, are you for real?

19:19.192 --> 19:21.228
Yeah. That's how
he plays, dirty.

19:21.261 --> 19:22.862
All right, well, I don't care
about all that.

19:22.895 --> 19:24.997
This kid's future
is bright.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.467
So whatever y'all did
to tempt him,

19:27.500 --> 19:28.568
you need to undo it.

19:28.601 --> 19:31.037
Oh, I do, do I?
Yeah.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.206
Undo it.
Do you know
how many kids

19:33.240 --> 19:35.308
would kill to have a recording
contract with Empire?

19:35.342 --> 19:37.544
Yes, I know, because
I see it every day.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.679
That's what I'm trying
to change.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.914
These kids need to know that
they can aspire to be more

19:41.948 --> 19:44.684
than a rapper
or an athlete or a...

19:44.717 --> 19:47.220
a hustler.
(chuckles)

19:47.254 --> 19:49.021
Boy, bye.

19:50.757 --> 19:52.859
All right, wait.
I'm sorry, wait!

19:54.261 --> 19:55.562
I'm sorry.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.364
That wasn't...

19:57.397 --> 19:59.532
Just, can you...

19:59.566 --> 20:01.868
I need you to see what I'm
trying to do with these kids.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.206
Please.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.246
This is the Black
Girls Code seminar.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.681
Zeah's a mentor.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.116
COOKIE: Black Girls Code?
ANGELO: Yeah.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.418
In computing alone,

20:18.451 --> 20:19.419
there are over a million
jobs in the U.S.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.120
People don't know that.

20:21.153 --> 20:24.023
So all these girls here, they
live in Zeah's neighborhood,

20:24.056 --> 20:25.124
they look up to him.

20:25.157 --> 20:26.959
Good.

20:28.395 --> 20:30.096
All right, see,
this is the future.

20:30.129 --> 20:32.098
This right here.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.733
This is how we rise.

20:38.771 --> 20:40.239
MAX:
This is a misdemeanor,

20:40.273 --> 20:41.808
and you own the home
you were coming out of.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.310
We should be out of here
in five minutes at the most.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.279
Out in five?

20:46.313 --> 20:47.747
Damn...

20:47.780 --> 20:50.317
I came ready to
bust you out of this joint, man.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.151
What y'all doing here?

20:52.184 --> 20:53.386
I told you this
was nothing.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.721
Shut up, Dre.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.222
We're gonna take
your jailbird ass out

20:56.255 --> 20:57.724
out to eat after this.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.225
BAILIFF:
All rise!

20:59.258 --> 21:02.228
The Honorable
Judge Barbara Reid presiding.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.430
Court is now in session.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.964
(bangs gavel)
Be seated.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.869
MAX:
Let's go, that's us.

21:16.175 --> 21:17.910
JUDGE:
Andre Lyon...

21:17.944 --> 21:19.979
the charges against you
are one count

21:20.012 --> 21:21.414
criminal trespassing.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.115
My client pleads
not guilty, Your Honor.

21:23.149 --> 21:25.251
I'm not finished,
Counselor.

21:25.284 --> 21:28.020
The defendant is also charged
with felony battery,

21:28.054 --> 21:31.924
aggravated assault, and assault
against a police officer.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.125
Your Honor, I--

21:33.159 --> 21:34.361
Step back!

21:37.364 --> 21:38.698
Your Honor, I didn't
assault anybody.

21:38.731 --> 21:41.668
That's what a trial
is for, Mr. Lyon,

21:41.701 --> 21:43.803
to determine your guilt
or innocence.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.687
Yo, so what do
all this mean, man?

22:00.720 --> 22:01.688
It means we might just need to

22:01.721 --> 22:03.222
plead out and cut a deal.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.891
I could probably swing probation
if it's your first offense,

22:04.924 --> 22:06.058
Wait. Wait.
and eventually,
this all goes away...

22:06.092 --> 22:07.527
No, hold the hell up.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.062
What do you mean,
"eventually" and "probation"?

22:10.096 --> 22:11.998
Max, you've known me for a
decade. You were in my wedding.

22:12.031 --> 22:14.501
Yo, Dre, this dude's an ass.
MAX: Listen.

22:14.534 --> 22:17.303
It... It's your word
against a cop's.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.339
But we'll be fine,
we just need to cut a deal.
No.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.708
Hell no. I'm not gonna lie
about being guilty

22:21.741 --> 22:22.875
when I didn't do anything,

22:22.909 --> 22:25.211
except go into
my own damn home, Max.

22:25.244 --> 22:26.946
This is insane.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.085
Get in.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.354
*

22:38.190 --> 22:40.660
Told you that you needed
to let Thirsty handle it,

22:40.693 --> 22:42.161
but you didn't want
to listen to me.

22:42.194 --> 22:45.698
So now, congratulations.
You're in the system.

22:45.732 --> 22:49.436
Hey, um, make a right
at the next corner,

22:49.469 --> 22:51.404
and then come to a stop.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.541
HAKEEM:
Yo, where you taking us?

22:54.574 --> 22:56.175
Our old neighborhood.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.445
This is where we grew up.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.012
We ain't never lived here.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.514
Yeah, we did.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.616
You were a baby.
You wouldn't remember.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.918
(coughing, car alarm sounding)

23:05.952 --> 23:07.887
LUCIOUS:
Take a good look around.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.356
I did everything I could
to shield y'all from this.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.858
Yeah.
Straight, all right?

23:11.891 --> 23:12.959
I'm cool.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.394
After your mama went away, I...

23:15.428 --> 23:18.397
got us up and out of here
as fast as humanly possible,

23:18.431 --> 23:20.433
but I coddled y'all.

23:20.467 --> 23:25.137
let y'all breathe rarified air
and live behind giant gates

23:25.171 --> 23:27.406
and drive in limos.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.909
Biggest mistake of my life.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.911
'Cause it made y'all soft.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.480
Now my sons

23:33.513 --> 23:35.815
walk these streets like food.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.784
Here endeth the lesson.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.752
This lesson's only begun, son.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.821
You see, self-preservation

23:41.854 --> 23:43.389
has the very first
rule of nature:

23:43.422 --> 23:46.559
it's kill or be killed
in these streets.

23:46.593 --> 23:47.794
Driver.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.261
Open this damn door.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.564
Why, so you can get out
and get beat up by the cops

23:51.598 --> 23:54.066
or thrown back in jail again?

23:54.100 --> 23:57.003
Or you get shot,
and go running and crying

23:57.036 --> 24:00.673
with your little girlfriends
in your... therapy club.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.308
Or you let some

24:02.341 --> 24:05.444
closet lady-boy
punk you in my club.

24:05.478 --> 24:07.346
I mean, this whole
time, I thought

24:07.379 --> 24:10.316
the problem was,
that you were bipolar

24:10.349 --> 24:12.685
and you were gay

24:12.719 --> 24:14.286
and you were just spoiled.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.723
But now I'm realizing...

24:19.058 --> 24:21.127
...y'all don't know
you're black.

24:22.495 --> 24:23.930
(sighs)

24:23.963 --> 24:25.264
Open...

24:25.297 --> 24:27.199
the door.
When you step outside

24:27.233 --> 24:31.804
of this high wall of privilege
that I've built around you,

24:31.838 --> 24:36.776
your name might as well be
Trayvon or Philando

24:36.809 --> 24:38.878
or Freddie.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.948
And the fault lies in me.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.850
'Cause I didn't prepare you.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.519
And it's something
you got to live with.

24:46.553 --> 24:49.155
But you better get woke,
and quick.

24:49.188 --> 24:52.491
Because you are one moment away
from becoming a hashtag,

24:52.525 --> 24:55.695
and I don't care how many
white wives or white lawyers

24:55.728 --> 24:58.531
you get...
Open this door!

24:58.565 --> 25:00.232
Open it!

25:00.266 --> 25:02.234
*

25:02.268 --> 25:04.971
You dare talk about my wife
after what happened?

25:05.004 --> 25:07.840
I don't know what it means
to be a black man in America?

25:09.709 --> 25:12.044
I know what it means
to be a Lyon.

25:12.078 --> 25:15.582
And I'd rather be in jail--
hell, I'd rather be dead--

25:15.615 --> 25:17.684
than end up like you.

25:19.451 --> 25:22.521
Open this damn door before
I break it off its hinges.

25:22.555 --> 25:25.024
You heard the Lyon.

25:25.057 --> 25:27.293
Open the door.
Let the Lyon out.

25:29.028 --> 25:30.362
MAN: Hey, that's my couch!
(dog barking)

25:30.396 --> 25:32.364
Hey, you got to get
yo feet off my couch...

25:32.398 --> 25:34.867
MAN 2:
Hey, yo, can I get a light?

25:42.374 --> 25:44.143
JAMAL:
Dre!

25:45.945 --> 25:48.815
MAN:
Oh, that's him! It's Jamal!

25:50.917 --> 25:53.720
Ain't you gonna
follow your sisters?

25:53.753 --> 25:55.287
Hell, nah, old man.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.089
Hey, yo.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.859
Take me and Original Black Man

25:59.892 --> 26:01.293

26:01.327 --> 26:03.395
I'm-a let 'em eat these words.

26:03.429 --> 26:05.364

26:05.397 --> 26:07.433

26:07.466 --> 26:10.136

27:24.143 --> 27:25.544
Damn!

27:25.577 --> 27:27.179
(chuckles)
You took that off of

27:27.213 --> 27:28.848
Tiana from two nights ago.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.984
Yeah. 100% owned by Empire.

27:32.018 --> 27:35.054
See now, that's that monster
I'm talking about.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.023
(phone ringing)

27:40.927 --> 27:43.095
Why are you calling me?

27:44.496 --> 27:46.398
Wait-wait, hell no.

27:46.432 --> 27:49.201
I'll be right there.

27:49.235 --> 27:51.037
Look.

27:51.070 --> 27:55.742
I want to see that
on your Channel tonight.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.643
Bring him home, Shine.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.411
Got it.

27:59.445 --> 28:01.781
*

28:03.449 --> 28:05.918
Where is she?

28:11.523 --> 28:13.592
What are you doing in my office?

28:14.961 --> 28:16.896
Almost...

28:18.230 --> 28:19.665
A little higher...

28:19.698 --> 28:20.699
Almost...

28:23.369 --> 28:24.536
Yes!

28:24.570 --> 28:26.739
Yes!

28:26.773 --> 28:28.107
Yes!
(hits table)

28:28.140 --> 28:29.742
(yelling):
Lucious!

28:29.776 --> 28:31.110
(sighs)

28:31.143 --> 28:33.379
You sound more excited than me.

28:33.412 --> 28:37.016
I am, Lucious.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.085
Oh! I am.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.858
(chuckles)

28:45.892 --> 28:47.760
Mm.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.597
ANIKA:
Don't worry.

28:51.630 --> 28:53.565
He was...
(opens box)

28:53.599 --> 28:56.602
just looking... for my earring.

28:58.437 --> 28:59.972
Oh, no, no!
(laughs)

29:00.006 --> 29:01.540
Nah, why you running out?

29:01.573 --> 29:02.909
(continues laughing)
Uh-uh. Come on.

29:02.942 --> 29:04.243
Yes.

29:12.651 --> 29:14.586
I only wanted
to remind you that

29:14.620 --> 29:16.923
when you push me,
I push back harder.

29:16.956 --> 29:18.124
Then I'll remind you

29:18.157 --> 29:20.559
that you are my wife,
in m house,

29:20.592 --> 29:21.928
and you're gonna act like it.

29:21.961 --> 29:23.662
And the only men that's gonna
be touching you in here

29:23.695 --> 29:26.632
is gonna be the coroner, when he
carries your dead-ass body away

29:26.665 --> 29:30.803
after my crazy-ass
mama kills you.

29:33.639 --> 29:35.741
No.

29:35.774 --> 29:37.343
Excuse me?

29:37.376 --> 29:39.445
That's not how this
is gonna go, Lucious.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.247
See, I married you to save...

29:41.280 --> 29:42.448
yo ass.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.950
And then I saved your ass again

29:43.983 --> 29:45.584
when I found that camera
in the teddy bear,

29:45.617 --> 29:47.653
so let's be clear.

29:47.686 --> 29:50.622
I am not the one who
needs this marriage.
No,

29:50.656 --> 29:53.759
you married me because
you always wanted to be

29:53.792 --> 29:55.862
Mrs. Lucious Lyon.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.264
Not anymore.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.532
I am here,
in this

30:00.566 --> 30:02.701
haunted house of horrors,
because I knew

30:02.734 --> 30:04.937
that if I did cooperate
with Tariq,

30:04.971 --> 30:06.873
my baby would grow up
without a mother.

30:12.744 --> 30:15.181
Very, very smart girl.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.385
And now you're cornered.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.522
And so are you.

30:25.091 --> 30:28.427
I'm just making
a point here, Lucious.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.630
I'm gonna do...

30:31.663 --> 30:33.665
what I want,

30:33.699 --> 30:35.734
when I want...

30:37.069 --> 30:41.040
or we both go down in flames.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.877
I like to call it mutually

30:44.911 --> 30:48.881
assured destruction.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.221
(buzzer sounds)

30:55.254 --> 30:59.325
(man speaks indistinctly
over P.A.)

30:59.358 --> 31:00.859
GUARD:
All clear!

31:00.893 --> 31:02.594
GUARD 2:
All right, let's go.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.964
Jamal. You finally came.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.170
No, no, no... stop, stop, stop!

31:11.203 --> 31:12.438
No, stop!
(screams)

31:12.471 --> 31:14.907
Now, hold on...

31:14.941 --> 31:16.842
Look, we good.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.477
We good.
Everything's okay.

31:19.478 --> 31:20.579
They got 15, right?

31:20.612 --> 31:21.847
That's right.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.615
I'll walk you back.

31:23.649 --> 31:26.452
Sorry I didn't come
see you sooner.
Aw.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.719
At least you're here.

31:27.753 --> 31:29.588
Yeah, I hate seeing you
like this.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.457
Such a waste of your
talent and everything.

31:31.490 --> 31:35.694
It is what it is. But...
What's up with you, though?

31:35.727 --> 31:37.763
I've been waiting to hear
the latest Jamal Lyon smash.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.531
Just laying low, you know?

31:39.565 --> 31:41.067
Yeah, I'm messed to come out.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.102
Ah, forget that album.
I ain't done with that anyway.

31:43.135 --> 31:44.703
The Jamal Lyon I know
is a beast in the studio.

31:44.736 --> 31:47.373
No, the Jamal Lyon that you knew
went missing when you shot him.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.540
Jamal, I didn't mean
to hurt you.

31:48.574 --> 31:49.808
No!
(gunshot, screams)

31:53.179 --> 31:56.048
Yeah, but you did.

31:56.082 --> 31:57.583
Freda.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.318
And now I'm sitting
here, I'm just...

31:59.351 --> 32:01.620
I'm... man, I'm ruined.

32:01.653 --> 32:04.156
Oh, and that's your fault.
You the one that did it.

32:04.190 --> 32:05.491
Oh, Jamal, please...

32:05.524 --> 32:07.226
Yo, somebody get her please?
Jamal!

32:07.259 --> 32:08.660
I did not mean to hurt you!

32:08.694 --> 32:09.895
Back up, prisoner.
I didn't! You got...

32:09.928 --> 32:11.230
Get off of me, man!
Come on!

32:11.263 --> 32:13.132
Jamal! Jamal!

32:17.103 --> 32:19.071
COOKIE:
Andre, go see where Jamal's at.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.639
I got it.

32:24.977 --> 32:26.145
They're waiting
on you, brother.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.519
Let's do this.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.687
*

32:39.825 --> 32:40.826
* It's too..

32:40.859 --> 32:43.162
(clears throat)
Sorry. Sorry.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.763
Hold up, hold up.
(music stops)

32:44.796 --> 32:45.931
Sorry.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.466
This is not my day.

32:47.499 --> 32:48.800
Hold up.
No, it's good.

32:48.834 --> 32:51.170
(sighs)

32:51.203 --> 32:53.872
Um...
You good?

32:53.905 --> 32:56.175
Yeah, I'm okay.
Hey, Jamal.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.543
(over intercom): If you ain't
really feeling this,

32:57.576 --> 32:59.178
we can reschedule this thing.

32:59.211 --> 33:01.113
Is that what
you want to do?

33:01.147 --> 33:02.348
No, no.

33:02.381 --> 33:04.316
KITTY: Personally,
I think we're good.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.884
JAMAL: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just give me a second

33:05.917 --> 33:07.719
because, just, can we turn
the lights down or something?

33:07.753 --> 33:09.288
That's good-- let's get
the mood right in the studio.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.023
I got it.

33:11.057 --> 33:13.859
I think we're about to be
front row and center

33:13.892 --> 33:15.694
for another Jamal flameout.

33:18.897 --> 33:20.199
Andre.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.368
They got you doing
everything around here.

33:22.401 --> 33:25.171
Just, uh, trying
to help out, Kitty.

33:25.204 --> 33:26.938
KITTY: Very nice.

33:31.777 --> 33:33.945
What a waste of time.

33:35.881 --> 33:38.217
So, um, I was thinking
at the bridge,

33:38.250 --> 33:40.052
we'd treat it like...
kind of like a rap session.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.587
MAN (on intercom):
He might need it.

33:41.620 --> 33:44.156
Throw Auto-Tunes
on the bridge.
Y'all ready?

33:44.190 --> 33:45.591
I'm ready.

33:45.624 --> 33:48.694
(piano intro plays)

33:48.727 --> 33:51.063
*

33:52.864 --> 33:56.402
* Tonight all things
are possible *

33:56.435 --> 34:00.372
* Come drink, my cup
it overflows *

34:00.406 --> 34:03.342
* Right now we face

34:03.375 --> 34:05.511
* The sunrise of love

34:05.544 --> 34:08.080
* Ah ah ah
* Mmm

34:08.114 --> 34:12.851
* You're bound to close
this little mind *

34:12.884 --> 34:16.422
* Wishes break in
and justify *

34:16.455 --> 34:18.957
* A sweet hurricane

34:18.990 --> 34:23.729
* Of love flowing
with the tide *

34:23.762 --> 34:27.766
* Now say you mean
the world to me *

34:27.799 --> 34:29.701
* See what you are

34:29.735 --> 34:31.370
* It's infamous...
* It's infamous...

34:31.403 --> 34:33.372
So how does that crow taste?

34:33.405 --> 34:35.707
I mean,
I'm surprised...

34:35.741 --> 34:37.809
but happy.

34:37.843 --> 34:39.378
*

34:39.411 --> 34:42.114
* I know it's dangerous

34:42.148 --> 34:45.284
* But I believe
a greater love... *

34:45.317 --> 34:47.119
Man, that boy's
high as a kite,

34:47.153 --> 34:48.220
but, damn,
they sound good.

34:48.254 --> 34:50.055
COOKIE:
Shut up.
He is not.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.224
KITTY:
* So turn to me

34:52.258 --> 34:54.160
* Carry on and on
and rap with me *

34:54.193 --> 34:56.762
* Long as it's real
in the rhythm *

34:56.795 --> 35:00.232
* Okay, you got quite
a reputation *
COOKIE: Yes, baby, that's it!

35:00.266 --> 35:02.434
* Been around since day one
baby, my A-one *

35:02.468 --> 35:04.236
* Knowing we have
a little past *

35:04.270 --> 35:07.906
* But, yeah, ain't nothin'
like that creation *

35:07.939 --> 35:10.075
* Carry on and on

35:10.108 --> 35:11.777
* Long as we're rolling
we're safe *

35:11.810 --> 35:14.580
* I'm going to say
so you know what that means *

35:14.613 --> 35:16.615
* It ain't my
last temptation *

35:16.648 --> 35:18.584
* I know that
my feelings is clouded *

35:18.617 --> 35:20.419
* But baby we can't
live without it *

35:20.452 --> 35:23.355
* Love's no game

35:23.389 --> 35:26.325
* Oh, carry on and on
and rap with me *

35:26.358 --> 35:28.126
* Long as we're rolling
it's safe ... *

35:28.160 --> 35:30.162
* Now say you're me
* Hey

* Never never

as long as it's moving *

35:43.842 --> 35:49.080
* Real for love
* Ah.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.951
Yes.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.786
(applause)

35:54.820 --> 35:56.522
(chuckles)

36:00.192 --> 36:03.729
Y'all are some bad, bad,
bad people up in there.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.175
I can't believe
this is real.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.411
LUCIOUS:
Oh, it's very real.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.413
That and much more,
anything you want.

36:21.447 --> 36:23.882
Even the keys
to a brand-new car.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.986
All you got to do is
sign on the dotted line.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.322
(sighs)
I'm a little nervous.

36:30.356 --> 36:31.723
Yeah, I'd be nervous,
too, if I was

36:31.757 --> 36:33.559
signing my life over
to the devil.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.394
(chuckles)
Look, Zeah,

36:35.427 --> 36:37.563
baby, I know
this is hard,

36:37.596 --> 36:40.999
so I'm gonna do this for you.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.434
What in the hell
do you think you're doing?

36:42.468 --> 36:45.203
Sending him to college,
where he belongs.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.207
Such a shame.

36:49.241 --> 36:51.009
You could have
been huge.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.345
Did Mr. Wonderful
put you up to this?

36:53.379 --> 36:55.514
I put me up to this.

36:55.547 --> 36:58.250
Zeah, look,
when I look at you,

36:58.284 --> 37:00.952
I see more
than a future

37:00.986 --> 37:02.788
multi-platinum-selling
artist.

37:02.821 --> 37:06.258
What I see is
a brilliant mind.

37:06.292 --> 37:08.260
Yeah, the world has
enough rappers.

37:08.294 --> 37:10.796
We don't need another one...
yet.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.398
But I tell you what.

37:12.431 --> 37:14.232
If you're serious
about music,

37:14.266 --> 37:16.802
you come see us after
you graduate in four years.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.571
Empire ain't going nowhere.

37:19.605 --> 37:23.742
You really think this business
is gonna wait for your ass?

37:23.775 --> 37:27.112
You have Cookie's word, baby.

37:27.145 --> 37:29.748
And that means a lot
out here on these streets.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.257
Thank you for what
you did for Zeah.

37:39.291 --> 37:40.326
You're welcome.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.663
Angelo...

37:44.696 --> 37:46.064
you're not
better than me.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.933
I'm not ashamed
of who I am,

37:47.966 --> 37:49.901
I'm not ashamed
of where I come from,

37:49.935 --> 37:51.637
or the fact that
Lucious and I started

37:51.670 --> 37:53.271
from the bottom
with nothing.

37:53.305 --> 37:54.740
And now we're here.

37:54.773 --> 37:59.511
I'm not ashamed
of the music I make, so...

37:59.545 --> 38:02.247
I understand that.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.415
I respect you.

38:03.449 --> 38:06.652
I respect your music,
and I respect

38:06.685 --> 38:08.520
everything that you do.

38:08.554 --> 38:09.788
Thank you.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.189
I mean that
for real, Cookie.

38:11.222 --> 38:13.925
Empire is an American triumph.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.961
That it is.
Mm-hmm.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.796
(chuckles)
Whoa...
Oh...

38:17.829 --> 38:20.198
(laughs)

38:20.231 --> 38:21.433
Let's get to lunch first.

38:21.467 --> 38:23.201
Yes.
I'll get at you.

38:23.234 --> 38:24.603
Okay. Nice try, though.

38:24.636 --> 38:27.238
I'll get it next time.
(Cookie laughs)

38:33.712 --> 38:36.181
Well, your father
should be happy.

38:36.214 --> 38:38.049
We got over
ten million subscribers,

38:38.083 --> 38:40.886
and we spiked
another 150,000

38:40.919 --> 38:42.954
just in the hour
after streaming

38:42.988 --> 38:44.490
you and Kitty's duet.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.493
Why are you standing here
looking stupid?

38:47.526 --> 38:48.527
Wait for it.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.928
Uh, wait for what?

38:54.232 --> 38:55.701
COOKIE (gasps):
The Black Album?

38:56.902 --> 38:58.470
What is that?
Yeah.

38:58.504 --> 38:59.671
Good thing I took
a bullet for him.

38:59.705 --> 39:00.806
Now I can kill him myself.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.508
Wait, wait,
wait, Jamal.

39:02.541 --> 39:04.643
LUCIOUS:
It's beautiful, ain't it?

39:04.676 --> 39:07.546
Uh... Jamal!

39:09.114 --> 39:11.316
So what the hell is
the damn Black Album?

39:11.349 --> 39:12.918
The Black Album?

39:12.951 --> 39:15.153
Just a little something
that came up

39:15.186 --> 39:16.722
in a marketing
brainstorm.

39:16.755 --> 39:19.991
You see, half the songs
on that album,

39:20.025 --> 39:22.227
which Jamal likes to call
"the black side,"

39:22.260 --> 39:23.495
is produced by me.

39:23.529 --> 39:24.930
Yeah, I know, I know.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.032
So all I had to do was
get rid of the songs

39:27.065 --> 39:28.667
that you produced,

39:28.700 --> 39:30.669
and it became this
whole new concept.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.871
I mean, his fans are
gonna love it, it'll probably...

39:32.904 --> 39:34.440
double subscription overnight.

39:35.974 --> 39:37.008
This ain't got
nothing to do

39:37.042 --> 39:39.411
with Empire XStream,
does it?

39:42.448 --> 39:44.215
Yeah, this is personal.

39:44.249 --> 39:45.617
Yeah, it's personal.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.419
But it's also business.

39:47.453 --> 39:48.687
'Cause, see that's what
we do, right?

39:48.720 --> 39:51.222
No, that's what
you do, Lucious.

39:51.256 --> 39:52.791
I like how y'all
are judging me,

39:52.824 --> 39:54.460
like y'all are walking
around with these haloes.

39:54.493 --> 39:55.927
I'm a human being, Cook.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.729
Good, you should try
acting like one.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.598
I did, until
you hurt my feelings.

39:59.631 --> 40:01.600
Oh, I kept hurting
your feelings, Lucious?

40:01.633 --> 40:03.234
Like you're the only one
walking around here

40:03.268 --> 40:04.703
with feelings,
really?

40:04.736 --> 40:05.737
Well, you're walking
around here

40:05.771 --> 40:07.038
demonizing me for how

40:07.072 --> 40:09.274
I run my company.

40:09.307 --> 40:11.443
But I haven't seen
ne'er one of y'all quit.

40:11.477 --> 40:13.211
Yeah, because half
of this company

40:13.244 --> 40:14.813
belongs to me.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.483
And that's the piece you
like to forget, Lucious.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.918
Half of this company?
Half, that's right.

40:19.951 --> 40:22.153
This whole separation
of responsibility

40:22.187 --> 40:23.622
that you keep
talking about,

40:23.655 --> 40:25.390
that's never gonna
happen.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.960
I'm retaking control
of Empire Music

40:28.994 --> 40:30.228
because,
at the end of the day,

40:30.261 --> 40:31.797
it's all business.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.965
Oh, you are, are you?

40:33.999 --> 40:36.835
Well, don't forget I have
the board on my side.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.003
So if you try
to kick me out,

40:38.036 --> 40:39.738
that means war.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.507
Is that what
you want, Lucious?

40:43.475 --> 40:45.276
Oh...
(chuckles)

40:45.310 --> 40:49.481
Well, all right...
baby.

40:49.515 --> 40:51.583
You wanna play?

40:51.617 --> 40:53.318
Let's play.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.389
Let the games begin, Cook.

40:59.825 --> 41:01.459
Let's play.

41:22.047 --> 41:23.882
Out walking while black.

41:23.915 --> 41:26.718
Isn't that what got you
in trouble in the first place?

41:26.752 --> 41:28.587
(sighs)

41:30.488 --> 41:31.690
What do you want?

41:31.723 --> 41:33.224
Just seeing
how you're doing

41:33.258 --> 41:35.493
under the weight
of some nasty charges.

41:35.527 --> 41:37.328
Assaulting
a police officer?

41:37.362 --> 41:39.230
Mm, mm, mm!

41:39.264 --> 41:42.167
I read Officer Horowitz's
amended report.

41:42.200 --> 41:45.236
He makes you sound
positively unhinged.

41:45.270 --> 41:48.006
You gonna see some time
after that-- believe that.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.544
You're behind this.

41:52.578 --> 41:55.681
Some twisted way of
getting back at my father.

41:55.714 --> 41:58.216
You got that officer to lie
and up my charges.

41:58.249 --> 42:00.886
Oh, I just sat back
and let the man talk.

42:00.919 --> 42:02.353
By the time he finished,

42:02.387 --> 42:04.522
he remembered all kinds
of mess about you.

42:04.556 --> 42:06.091
That's how they do.

42:06.124 --> 42:09.561
I just made sure I took
advantage of the situation.

42:11.797 --> 42:12.831
Mm.

42:12.864 --> 42:15.701
You think I'm scared...

42:15.734 --> 42:19.037
of some trumped-up charges
from a trumped-up Fed?

42:19.070 --> 42:22.007
Is that what
you think I am?

42:22.040 --> 42:24.342
Maybe I'm just
a black sheep just like you.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.912
Hmm? Nah,
hear me out, nephew.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.580
We ain't so far apart.

42:28.614 --> 42:31.382
Maybe you should
do yourself a favor...

42:31.416 --> 42:35.353
before we get you,
too. Hmm?

42:35.386 --> 42:37.288
I get it. You think
you can make me

42:37.322 --> 42:38.624
inform on my father

42:38.657 --> 42:41.860
in exchange for dropping
some charges, right?

42:41.893 --> 42:44.429
Let me help you out, Uncle.

42:44.462 --> 42:45.964
That ain't gonna happen.

42:45.997 --> 42:49.701
You are your father's son
after all.

42:49.735 --> 42:51.302
Well, we shall see.

42:51.336 --> 42:54.372
It doesn't take much to put
the screws on a black man,

42:54.405 --> 42:56.441
once he's part
of the system.

42:56.474 --> 43:00.478
And you ain't no
ordinary black man.

43:00.511 --> 43:03.514
You're a Lyon.
Prize game.

43:05.283 --> 43:07.185
Have a good night,
nephew.

Do you two have any idea
what this number is?

-Last night's winning Lotto.
-The number of cats
in your apartment.

44:16.221 --> 44:21.026
It's the amount of money
you two cost the city
working together for three days.

44:21.059 --> 44:23.661
You've been on the job 25 years.
Not a nick on you.

44:24.763 --> 44:26.564
You get partnered with Riggs
