00:11.345 --> 00:13.680
<i>Usually, when I looked
into the mirror,</i>

00:13.764 --> 00:15.682
<i>I could only focus on my flaws.</i>

00:15.974 --> 00:20.729
<i>That my stomach wasn't flat enough,
my thighs weren't thin enough.</i>

00:20.812 --> 00:22.231
<i>My butt wasn't high enough.</i>

00:22.898 --> 00:26.068
<i>But I finally had
something else to focus on.</i>

00:30.614 --> 00:33.200
<i>It made me feel invincible.</i>

00:33.575 --> 00:38.413
<i>King Arthur had Excalibur
and now, I had a crown.</i>

00:38.997 --> 00:43.460
<i>I was going to be a queen
and nothing could get in my way.</i>

Oh, my God!

00:54.680 --> 00:55.764
Whoa.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.393
No way.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.188
Ew!

01:04.397 --> 01:05.440
What the eff?

01:06.275 --> 01:08.068
What the eff? Wha...

01:08.151 --> 01:10.988
Why the hell did you send out a picture
of Dixie Sinclair's hoo-ha

01:11.071 --> 01:12.197
to the entire school?

01:12.281 --> 01:13.323
I didn't.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.035
Oh, my God!
It looks like it came from my phone.

01:17.119 --> 01:19.371
How did you even get
a picture of Dixie's...?

01:19.454 --> 01:20.956
I didn't. I don't have one.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.584
How would this even happen?

01:23.667 --> 01:24.876
Where's your phone?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.506
You're sure you had this with you
the entire morning?

01:29.590 --> 01:31.758
- Yes.
- Somebody must have hacked your phone.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.135
Who would hack Patty's phone?

01:33.218 --> 01:36.722
Clearly someone who has naked pictures
of Dixie Sinclair.

01:38.682 --> 01:39.558
Don't look at me.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.518
Dixie's on Teen Roulette.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.855
There's at least 30 different guys
who have pictures of her shenanigans.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.940
Oh, gross. Doesn't that bother you?

01:47.024 --> 01:49.401
- She's your girlfriend.
- No, she's not.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.862
She was just using me for my dong.
So I ended it.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.239
What? You guys are already over?

01:54.823 --> 01:56.575
All I wanted to do was
take her out to dinner,

01:56.658 --> 01:59.703
but she didn't want to be seen
with me in public.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.956
Her loss. She's a moron.

02:03.498 --> 02:07.210
You're smart and sweet and handsome.

02:07.753 --> 02:08.836
Really?

02:09.920 --> 02:10.797
Focus on the problem.

02:10.881 --> 02:13.258
Who the hell would hack my phone
and make it look like I...?

02:14.217 --> 02:16.470
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

02:16.553 --> 02:18.764
It's an email from
the Miss Magic Jesus Pageant Board.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.557
They heard about the Dixie photos.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.770
they're disqualifying me
for cyber-bullying.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.521
Well, that's one mystery solved.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.440
Somebody's trying to sabotage you.

02:30.359 --> 02:31.777
Dixie Sinclair.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.321
No way. She's not smart enough
to hack your phone.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.531
Okay, so who else would...?

02:36.615 --> 02:37.908
I got to talk to Bob.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.161
I should go after her.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.331
Or you could just stay here.

02:45.374 --> 02:46.249
Why?

02:49.169 --> 02:51.046
Did you mean what you said earlier?

02:51.755 --> 02:52.798
That I'm...

02:54.049 --> 02:57.094
smart and sweet and handsome?

02:58.261 --> 02:59.179
Yeah.

02:59.971 --> 03:00.806
Why?

03:22.494 --> 03:25.080
<i>Every morning, I put on my armor
like a knight.</i>

03:25.163 --> 03:27.666
<i>I readied myself for battle each day.</i>

03:27.791 --> 03:30.585
<i>And since Patty had won
the mother-daughter pageant,</i>

03:30.669 --> 03:33.338
<i>I felt like I had slain my first dragon.</i>

03:33.922 --> 03:38.218
<i>Now, I was ready to go on my very own
grail quest for Patty</i>

03:38.301 --> 03:42.931
<i>to win the Miss Magic Jesus crown
and nothing could get in my way.</i>

03:48.687 --> 03:50.939
<i>"Dear Bob. Patty gave me this.</i>

03:51.481 --> 03:52.733
<i>I know you cheated.</i>

03:52.941 --> 03:54.609
<i>I need time and space to think.</i>

03:54.693 --> 03:57.446
<i>I'll call when I'm ready to talk.
Coralee."</i>

03:58.655 --> 04:01.158
<i>And suddenly,
I had another dragon to slay.</i>

04:01.616 --> 04:02.826
<i>Patty Bladell.</i>

04:05.662 --> 04:09.166
<i>We regret to inform you,
you have been blocked by this user.</i>

04:09.833 --> 04:11.793
Shit! Shit! Shit!

04:18.591 --> 04:20.969
Magnolia, wait up!

04:21.762 --> 04:24.347
I still can't believe you don't want
to drive to school together.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.309
I've seen plenty of you this morning,
thanks to Patty Bladell.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.771
Don't judge me! Patty's a cyber-bully.

04:31.188 --> 04:33.440
And you should be on my side,
as my friend.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.234
We are not friends. Just because my dad
let you move into our house

04:36.318 --> 04:38.236
because he felt bad
for putting your mom in jail.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.405
Okay, fine. Not friends, sisters.

04:40.489 --> 04:41.406
We are not!

04:41.490 --> 04:44.618
Stop climbing into my bed at night
and spooning me. It's weird.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.912
But I miss my mama
and I can't sleep alone.

04:46.995 --> 04:47.829
That's pathetic.

04:49.623 --> 04:50.832
You're pathetic.

04:52.501 --> 04:55.337
At least my boyfriend's not
sleeping with some old slut!

04:58.089 --> 04:59.132
Which old slut?

04:59.216 --> 05:00.425
My mama.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.178
So suck on that, mo-fo.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.146
Hey.

05:13.522 --> 05:14.856
Regina Sinclair?

05:16.900 --> 05:18.318
You're disgusting.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.612
- How'd you...?
- Did you think I wouldn't find out?

05:21.738 --> 05:23.156
Don't ever talk to me again.

05:25.033 --> 05:27.118
Mag, Mag, Mag, I'm sorry.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.080
Oh, God!

05:33.959 --> 05:37.295
- Hey, Bob, I was just about to call you.
- Care to explain this?

05:39.130 --> 05:40.173
I, uh...

05:40.257 --> 05:42.634
Coralee left me
and it's all 'cause of you.

05:42.717 --> 05:46.888
Why on God's green earth
would you give this to Coralee?

05:47.556 --> 05:51.810
- Were you trying to hurt me?
- No. No, I was trying to hurt Coralee.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.312
We really bonded
in the mother-daughter pageant

05:54.396 --> 05:57.190
and then she just totally blew me off.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.026
Like I didn't matter at all.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.655
It's exactly what my own mom does to me
and she knew that.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.616
Coralee knew that and
that's what made it a million times worse.

06:07.325 --> 06:08.910
I wanted her to feel as bad as I did,

06:08.994 --> 06:11.580
but I didn't think about
how it would affect you. I'm so sorry.

06:11.663 --> 06:15.917
I was trying to help you
and this is how you repay me.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.878
This... This is not working.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.380
Are you breaking up with me?

06:20.463 --> 06:23.216
No, we cannot break up.
We are not a couple!

06:23.592 --> 06:26.511
- Are you still gonna coach me?
- I don't... I don't know.

06:26.595 --> 06:27.637
I need you.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.850
I just got disqualified from
Miss Magic Jesus for cyber-bullying.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.604
- Somebody hacked my phone and...
- You need to deal with that yourself.

06:35.687 --> 06:39.357
I can't. I don't know how to do any of
this pageant stuff without you.

06:39.983 --> 06:42.569
You and I, we were in this together.
We both needed a win.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.696
Yeah, I just...
I need to figure out my life first.

06:44.779 --> 06:45.780
Dad?

06:47.198 --> 06:50.118
- What are you doing here?
- I needed to speak with Patty.

06:50.201 --> 06:53.496
Maybe if you were a little less concerned
with pageants, Mom wouldn't have left.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.956
You want to tell me what happened?

06:55.040 --> 06:57.125
When I asked her,
she told me to talk to you.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.127
Now is neither the time nor the place.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.963
Yeah, right. Let me know when
you can work me into your schedule.

07:09.721 --> 07:12.891
<i>It looked like I had hurt
more than just Bob's marriage.</i>

07:14.059 --> 07:15.644
<i>I had hurt Brick too.</i>

07:16.269 --> 07:18.772
Hey, Brick, I'm sorry.

07:19.022 --> 07:19.856
For what?

07:19.940 --> 07:22.400
<i>I couldn't tell him
I blew up his parents' marriage.</i>

07:22.484 --> 07:25.946
For... taking time away
from you and your dad.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.657
He and I have spent
a lot of time together lately.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.576
Yeah, don't worry about it.
We don't spend any time together anyways.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.745
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.914
All he cares about are his pageant girls.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.750
I thought maybe if I was a winner too,
he might pay attention to me.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.669
But I'm the number one wrestler
in my division,

07:40.752 --> 07:42.212
he hasn't been to one of my matches.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.089
- That's horrible.
- Yeah, I'm used to it.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.342
But as long as we're apologizing,
I'm sorry too...

07:47.425 --> 07:49.052
for blowing you off when you asked me out.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.389
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.975
I've been thinking about it
since you started working with my dad

07:55.058 --> 07:57.394
and I feel really bad for
how crappy I was to you.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.645
Will you forgive me?

08:01.982 --> 08:04.776
Cool, um... thanks.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.786
Um... Oh!

08:14.869 --> 08:17.706
And now that you're gay, or whatever,

08:17.789 --> 08:20.625
I do community service
at the LGBTQ Center.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.335
- So if you ever want to come by...
- Sorry.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.212
Uh, gay?

08:25.213 --> 08:26.339
Who said I was gay?

08:26.423 --> 08:28.717
Um... everyone at school.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.892
Do you know anything about this?

08:38.226 --> 08:40.227
People are saying
you and Dixie were together.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.479
Like, sexually.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.773
- What are you talking about?
- I guess it makes sense.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.650
Why else would you have
pictures of her hoo-ha?

08:45.734 --> 08:46.818
What?

08:46.901 --> 08:49.821
People are saying you sent them out
because you're jealous of her and Choi.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.197
Oh, my God.

08:51.281 --> 08:52.782
Hey, look on the bright side.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.617
There's nothing wrong
with being a lesbian.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.327
People don't think you're a cyber-bully.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.787
Well, the pageant board still does.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.873
Ugh... This sucks.

08:59.956 --> 09:03.001
First, you got bullied for being fat
and now you're getting gay bashed.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.461
Right, it's so stupid.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.213
I'm not even gay
and even if I was, who should care?

09:07.297 --> 09:09.841
Um, your new girlfriend might.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.803
I'm not gay.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.556
Why would you think I was gay?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.683
Didn't you say
there's nothing wrong with being gay?

09:18.767 --> 09:19.893
Yeah, for you.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.187
Whatever. I have bigger problems.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.732
I got disqualified from Miss Magic Jesus
for sending out those Dixie pics,

09:25.815 --> 09:27.025
which I didn't do.

09:27.108 --> 09:30.487
Somebody must have hacked my phone.
So, now my pageant future is toast.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.446
I can help.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.282
What? Why?
Aren't I, like, your competition?

09:34.365 --> 09:36.868
Are you kidding?
It'd be amazing if you did win.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.954
I am so over pageants
and if someone else beat me,

09:40.038 --> 09:42.207
maybe my dad would finally let me quit.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.959
Sit with me at lunch
and we'll figure everything out.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.002
- Okay.
- Yeah.

09:54.302 --> 09:58.306
I was reading the paper when I heard
a knock on the door. It was the police,

09:58.389 --> 10:00.016
who asked me about my son.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.227
<i>Coralee still wasn't
returning my calls.</i>

10:02.310 --> 10:07.065
<i>But this was my first case since Patty,
so I tried to focus.</i>

10:07.565 --> 10:09.234
So imagine my surprise

10:09.317 --> 10:12.695
when I found out my son had been arrested
for having drugs in his car.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.031
I told you, they weren't mine.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.742
I was holding them for Magnolia Barnard.
She asked me to.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.536
Magnolia Barnard is on drugs?

10:24.332 --> 10:27.293
What's the charge?
Possession, distribution?

10:27.377 --> 10:28.294
Possession.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.213
Mm-hmm. And his first offense?

10:30.672 --> 10:33.091
He'll probably get community service
and probation.

10:33.174 --> 10:37.011
- It's all pretty straightforward.
- See. Now, can I go to school?

10:37.971 --> 10:41.307
Go. But I expect you home
immediately afterwards.

10:48.857 --> 10:52.193
I know you, right?
I saw you talking to Patty this morning.

10:52.277 --> 10:56.239
Yeah? I'm her pageant coach, I think.

10:56.781 --> 10:57.615
Oh.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.159
Well, say hi from me.

11:04.539 --> 11:07.876
He's a real charmer, my son.
With those eyes and that smile.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.544
He is a very handsome boy.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.379
He's a manipulative little shit!

11:11.462 --> 11:12.297
I'm sorry?

11:12.380 --> 11:14.632
He even talked the cops
into believing that bullshit story

11:14.716 --> 11:16.467
about Magnolia Barnard.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.720
He's not holding, he's dealing.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.432
He takes calls, runs errands
at all hours of the night.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.810
All kinds of weird kids coming over
to our house for five minutes at a time.

11:25.894 --> 11:26.936
I know the signs.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.938
Why are you telling me all this?

11:29.022 --> 11:33.151
Because I'm at the end of my rope and
I think some jail time would do him good.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.486
I want you to throw the case.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.821
You want me to throw...?

11:37.614 --> 11:40.700
That would be unethical.
Why would you think that I...?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.994
Because Coralee said you would.

11:43.786 --> 11:47.665
You see, I'm an Angel donor
at Coralee's service organization, Wombs.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.835
And when she and I spoke, she told me

11:50.919 --> 11:53.755
that you would do whatever it took
to fix things.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.090
And I did my research,
your career is in the shitter.

11:56.174 --> 11:58.551
It's not like you have
a reputation to protect.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.805
<i>Coralee's subtext was
loud and clear.</i>

12:03.097 --> 12:04.933
<i>Wombs was important to her</i>

12:05.016 --> 12:08.228
<i>and this was a way to show her
that she was important to me.</i>

12:08.811 --> 12:12.106
<i>Yes, it was unethical,
but so was my infidelity</i>

12:12.190 --> 12:15.026
<i>and I was desperate to win back Coralee.</i>

12:15.777 --> 12:18.196
<i>Desperate enough
to make a deal with the devil.</i>

12:18.988 --> 12:20.573
<i>I am a victim!</i>

12:20.657 --> 12:23.952
Attention! I am a victim!

12:24.619 --> 12:28.039
Patty Bladell is a cyber-bully!

12:34.295 --> 12:36.089
Lesbian bitch fight!

12:36.172 --> 12:40.885
No, no, no, no! It is not!
It is just a regular bitch fight!

12:45.515 --> 12:46.849
Dixie, get off me!

12:51.396 --> 12:52.897
Patty! Over here.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.318
Why are we sitting with Magnolia Barnard?

12:57.402 --> 12:59.279
Because without Bob, I need her help.

12:59.737 --> 13:03.783
Plus, Magnolia is awesome.
She's pretty and smart and nice.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.451
I know, it's annoying.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.120
Hey.

13:07.203 --> 13:10.123
- Make room for Patty and her girlfriend.
- Friend, who's a girl.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.332
That's what I said.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.169
Dixie's the worst, right?

13:15.253 --> 13:18.506
And she's living in my house.
It's a total disastrophe.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.633
Anyway, let's talk about
your pageant issues.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.136
What you have is an image problem.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.138
You need to worry about the pageant board.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.390
We have to get them thinking
you're a good person,

13:27.473 --> 13:29.726
someone who's deserving
of the Miss Magic Jesus crown.

13:30.268 --> 13:33.146
- So, how do we do that?
<i>- </i> We need a multi-pronged approach.

13:33.229 --> 13:36.232
First, we need to prove to them that
you didn't send out that picture of Dixie.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.775
Figure out who hacked your phone.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.777
I could ask the guys
in Computer Club for help.

13:39.861 --> 13:40.695
Great idea.

13:40.778 --> 13:44.157
In the meantime, we need to present you
as some one who's kind, charitable.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.951
The kind of person who never would've
cyber-bullied in the first place.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.788
Hmm... Do you have any philanthropy
on your resume?

13:50.872 --> 13:53.249
Because most of the main competitors
for Miss Magic Jesus

13:53.333 --> 13:56.085
have earned at least $5,000
for their respective charities.

13:56.169 --> 13:57.170
Shit, really?

13:57.253 --> 14:00.298
You should choose a cause that has
something to do with your platform.

14:00.715 --> 14:02.675
- Do you have one yet?
- A platform? Yeah.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.470
It's something about being fat
and then not being fat.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.973
Perfect. Awareness of eating
and body dysmorphic disorders.

14:09.057 --> 14:13.686
You can raise money for the Northern
Georgia Eating Disorder Recovery Clinic.

14:13.770 --> 14:17.190
- Oh, my God! You're really good at this.
- Now, we just need an event.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.362
- Bikini car wash?
- Played out.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.365
- Dog adoption?
- Yawn.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.201
Bikini dog wash?

14:28.785 --> 14:32.163
- Bikini dog wash?
- Bikini dog wash!

14:32.246 --> 14:34.707
Bikini dog wash!

14:35.124 --> 14:38.044
Bikinis for girls recovering
from eating disorders...

14:38.127 --> 14:40.421
- isn't that sort of...?
- Let's do it. This weekend?

14:40.505 --> 14:43.341
Amazing. Patty, you talk to
the Computer Club about your phone.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.260
I'll talk to Student Council about
getting a permit for this dog wash.

14:46.344 --> 14:50.390
- And Nonnie, can you make a flyer?
- She'll totally do it. Right, Nonnie?

14:50.473 --> 14:53.393
- Whatever you say.
- Okay, perfect.

14:53.476 --> 14:56.646
Okay, now that that's sorted,
how are we gonna get the word out?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.731
First things first,
'cause it's all about promotion.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.025
Patty's losing her mind.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.361
"Oh. Magnolia's so awesome.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.822
Magnolia's so everything."

15:07.281 --> 15:08.449
What's wrong?

15:08.825 --> 15:11.077
Everything is always about Patty.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.038
I'm such an idiot.
I should have known you were gay.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.457
Wait, what?

15:16.541 --> 15:18.501
Everyone's saying
you and Patty are a couple.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.336
What the hell, Choi?

15:20.545 --> 15:22.922
Did I seem gay
when your tongue was in my mouth?

15:23.005 --> 15:26.175
No, but whenever we're together,
all you do is talk about her.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.677
That is so not true.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.847
It is true. And if you're into Patty,
it's totally cool,

15:30.930 --> 15:33.599
but please, just be honest.

15:33.683 --> 15:36.978
I am not into Patty.
I'm super annoyed at her.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.856
Six months ago, Magnolia
wouldn't give her the time of day.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.650
I'm the one who was there when
she ran out of Weight Watcher's points,

15:42.733 --> 15:45.027
when she ate birthday cake
out of the trash.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.112
You sound jealous.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.363
Seriously?

15:47.447 --> 15:51.325
I just got out of a situation where I was
more into someone than they were into me.

15:51.409 --> 15:55.329
So, when you figure your shit out,
let me know.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.092
- Gentlemen.
- What?

16:08.176 --> 16:09.343
Oh, hi.

16:09.427 --> 16:13.139
I need your help. Somebody hacked my phone
and leaked those pictures of Dixie.

16:13.514 --> 16:16.851
- I need you to figure out who.
- Wait, what's in it for us?

16:17.685 --> 16:18.603
Uh...

16:19.020 --> 16:20.104
What do you want?

16:20.188 --> 16:21.856
- A date.
- With all of us.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.900
Collectively. Three.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.905
Gross. You can't just leverage me
like that, it's wrong.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.492
Okay. Hey, was it wrong when you
showed your boobs to Donald Choi?

16:34.327 --> 16:36.204
Yeah, it's a small town, people talk.

16:36.746 --> 16:37.788
This was a bad idea.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.208
Hey, mystery girl, maybe I can help you.

16:41.542 --> 16:45.046
Oh, no. That burnout over there
has no idea how to trace a hacker.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.840
Loser, what's it like to have sex
with a USB port?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.052
Christian, how do you...?

16:51.135 --> 16:54.889
I've traveled the world with my dad,
spent most of my time in Internet cafes.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.767
I met this guy in Brussels,
he took me under his wing,

16:57.850 --> 16:59.143
taught me all about the dark web.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.395
So, you can help me?

17:01.479 --> 17:02.355
For a price.

17:04.357 --> 17:07.276
- You're just as bad as they are.
- Not like that.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.195
I need your help with something too.

17:13.199 --> 17:14.367
I can trust you, right?

17:16.327 --> 17:17.161
I'm in trouble.

17:17.244 --> 17:21.790
Last Saturday night,
I, uh, got arrested with drugs in my car.

17:22.916 --> 17:25.502
My mom thinks I'm dealing, which I'm not.

17:25.752 --> 17:27.880
And she wants my lawyer to throw the case,

17:27.964 --> 17:30.091
because she thinks some jail time
would do me good.

17:30.174 --> 17:31.676
That sucks.

17:32.093 --> 17:34.262
But I'm not sure how I can help you.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.556
My lawyer is your pageant coach.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.476
I need you to help me convince him
to keep me out of jail.

17:40.935 --> 17:42.353
You guys are close, right?

17:44.146 --> 17:45.481
Not at the moment.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.276
Besides, Bob would never throw a case.
It's unethical.

17:48.943 --> 17:50.778
Maybe you don't know him
as well as you think.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.906
He definitely agreed to do it.
I heard my parents arguing about it.

17:55.366 --> 17:58.035
So, can you talk to him for me?

17:59.078 --> 18:00.913
I'm not sure he would listen.

18:00.997 --> 18:03.416
Then I'm not sure if I can help you.

18:07.044 --> 18:10.715
<i>Christian was my only hope
at getting back into Miss Magic Jesus.</i>

18:10.798 --> 18:14.260
<i>So even if it was a long shot,
I had to take my chances.</i>

18:14.343 --> 18:15.636
Christian, wait!

18:19.890 --> 18:21.350
<i>With a charge so small,</i>

18:21.434 --> 18:24.562
<i>Christian was likely to get off
with a slap on the wrist,</i>

18:24.645 --> 18:27.690
<i>which would leave me
in the doghouse with Coralee.</i>

18:28.065 --> 18:32.361
<i>If I wanted Christian in jail,
I'd have to bat Barnard's beehive.</i>

18:32.903 --> 18:35.615
<i>Luckily, I had an ace up my sleeve.</i>

18:38.034 --> 18:39.952
Patty, what are you doing?

18:40.036 --> 18:42.788
Look, Bob, I know you're mad at me,
but I need your help.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.959
La, la, la! No, no, no! I have no time.
I'm on my way to a meeting.

18:47.043 --> 18:49.754
Is it true you agreed to throw
Christian's case for his mom?

18:50.379 --> 18:53.549
Why is that any of your business?

18:53.633 --> 18:56.302
Because Christian said he can help me
figure out who hacked my phone,

18:56.385 --> 18:58.429
but only if I convince you
to keep him out of jail.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.097
I am his attorney.

19:00.181 --> 19:03.309
Obviously, I will do everything I can
to defend him.

19:04.018 --> 19:05.978
That's not what his mom said.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.439
He overheard her saying that
you agreed to throw the case.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.775
I had to, because of you.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.944
- Wait, what?
- It's a favor for Coralee.

19:14.570 --> 19:17.782
It's my best chance at getting her back
after the stunt you pulled.

19:17.865 --> 19:23.788
So, if you'll excuse me, I have to go
swallow my pride and compromise my morals

19:23.871 --> 19:25.623
because of your bad judgment.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.377
Wait... Wait, so you're not gonna help me?

19:29.460 --> 19:30.920
What about Miss Magic Jesus?

19:31.003 --> 19:34.548
Maybe you should have thought of that
before you decided to blow up my life.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.721
Just so you know,
Brick thinks you don't care about him.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.515
Excuse me?

19:42.973 --> 19:44.558
After you left the school, we talked.

19:44.642 --> 19:47.186
He told me that all he wants is
for you to pay attention to him

19:47.269 --> 19:50.231
and you haven't even bothered to show up
to one of his wrestling matches.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.275
He said that?

19:54.068 --> 19:55.027
I...

19:55.361 --> 19:56.779
I got to go see him.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.449
<i>If there's one thing
Coralee and I would agree on,</i>

20:00.533 --> 20:04.578
<i>it's that Brick was more important.
Barnard would have to wait.</i>

20:12.128 --> 20:15.423
- What in the hell are you doing?
- My community service.

20:15.506 --> 20:19.468
I got caught texting and driving,
so they assigned me here.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.303
I mean, that.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.806
Oh, the director asked me
to paint over the slurs.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.892
I'm pretty sure he meant
on the outside of the building.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.982
I can't do anything right.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.068
Honey, it's just paint.

20:36.152 --> 20:37.319
No, I am a mess.

20:38.529 --> 20:41.866
My girlfriend just broke up with me
because I slept with someone else's mom.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.785
Well, why'd you cheat? Were you not happy?

20:45.911 --> 20:48.581
I don't know.
I didn't really think about it.

20:49.373 --> 20:52.001
Did she not make you laugh?
Could you talk to her?

20:52.084 --> 20:54.253
All I know is, I hurt her
and I want to make it right.

20:55.379 --> 20:58.507
Sweetie, sometimes you can't
un-ring a bell.

20:59.759 --> 21:03.554
I'm screwed. Bob hates me and if
I don't figure out who hacked my phone,

21:03.637 --> 21:05.264
I'm never gonna get into Miss Magic Jesus.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.391
Relax. One thing at a time.

21:07.975 --> 21:11.520
We'll work on your philanthropy
and then we'll work on clearing your name.

21:11.604 --> 21:15.107
All thanks to Magnolia Barnard's
multi-pronged plan.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.776
Is something wrong?

21:17.485 --> 21:18.319
Uh...

21:18.402 --> 21:22.490
At lunch... you just let Magnolia
boss me around.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.910
I'm your best friend,
now you're just gonna up and ditch me

21:25.993 --> 21:27.661
because Magnolia Barnard is so awesome.

21:27.745 --> 21:28.788
No, Nonnie.

21:28.871 --> 21:32.374
Look, no matter what happens,
you're still my number one.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.084
Good.

21:35.252 --> 21:39.006
Because I think the flyer I made for you
is also pretty freaking awesome.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.593
Where'd you get
all those pictures of girls in bikinis?

21:43.219 --> 21:46.430
Uh, from a website,
which I've never been to before.

21:48.057 --> 21:49.975
God, I wish I looked that good
in a bikini.

21:50.601 --> 21:51.811
Have you seen yourself?

21:51.894 --> 21:53.479
Yeah, I'm thinner.

21:53.562 --> 21:57.191
I still have to lose 100 pounds before I'd
even think about getting into a bikini.

21:57.274 --> 21:59.944
Stop. Your body is banging.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.738
I'm still not gonna put on a bikini
in front of other people.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.241
Uh, you kind of have to.

22:06.075 --> 22:09.078
It's your event. It won't look good
if you don't participate.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.914
- This is a catastrophe.
- It's not nuclear war.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.040
I'll help you.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.418
- Patty told you that?
- Is it true?

22:16.710 --> 22:18.128
You think I don't care about you?

22:18.212 --> 22:19.672
What am I supposed to think?

22:19.755 --> 22:22.800
You don't ask me anything
about my life, my friends, school.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.678
- I don't know what to ask.
- You are proving my point.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.056
Okay, yeah, we're nothing alike,
but I'm still your son,

22:29.139 --> 22:32.101
so you can't just... blow me off.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.062
Oh, my God.

22:36.272 --> 22:37.439
Oh, my God.

22:38.148 --> 22:39.400
I'm doing it to you.

22:40.234 --> 22:41.652
The same thing he did to me.

22:41.735 --> 22:42.736
Who?

22:43.487 --> 22:45.948
My own dad.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.951
He wanted a wide receiver
and instead he got Henry Higgins.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.662
Higgins, is that like
a baseball player, or...?

22:51.745 --> 22:56.292
Lord, no!
It is only the most iconic character...

22:56.375 --> 22:58.502
Okay, look, it doesn't matter.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.755
I'm sorry.

23:02.256 --> 23:05.801
I never meant to make
you feel the way I felt.

23:07.344 --> 23:10.556
And I'm so proud of you
and your accomplishments.

23:10.931 --> 23:12.516
How can I make it up to you?

23:14.143 --> 23:17.688
For starters, you can tell me
what happened between you and mom.

23:28.490 --> 23:32.077
Decades ago, before you were born,

23:33.245 --> 23:36.498
I had an affair...

23:37.875 --> 23:39.877
with my pageant-coaching mentor.

23:39.960 --> 23:44.465
Your mom just found out about it
and she needs some time to think.

23:45.841 --> 23:46.842
Do you regret it?

23:47.259 --> 23:49.595
One-million percent.

23:49.929 --> 23:53.182
It was... It was a stupid, stupid mistake.

23:55.893 --> 23:57.144
Did you love her?

23:59.438 --> 24:03.108
I don't know.
Maybe, but I loved your mother more.

24:03.192 --> 24:04.443
Then why'd you cheat?

24:08.238 --> 24:12.117
It was a certain time,
it was a certain place.

24:12.201 --> 24:15.996
Stella Rose and I had mutual interests,
mutual goals.

24:17.373 --> 24:21.085
Also, there was a lot of drink
and she liked it rough

24:21.168 --> 24:23.796
and wanted to try some stuff
that your mama just wouldn't.

24:23.879 --> 24:27.257
Stop!
I did not want to know that.

24:27.341 --> 24:28.342
You asked.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.844
No, I was asking if you and mom
thought you could work it out.

24:31.845 --> 24:33.180
I am trying.

24:34.723 --> 24:35.557
How?

24:35.975 --> 24:42.147
The next time you talk to your mom,
tell her I'm doing what she asked,

24:42.231 --> 24:45.859
because I'm willing to do
whatever it takes to get her back, okay?

24:47.486 --> 24:48.612
Whatever, Dad.

24:59.832 --> 25:00.874
Patty?

25:01.834 --> 25:02.876
You okay?

25:04.294 --> 25:06.046
You've been in there for a while.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.261
Patty?

25:14.346 --> 25:15.389
I'm...

25:16.473 --> 25:17.683
I'm coming in.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.604
Oh, my God! What's wrong?

25:23.605 --> 25:24.565
I'm gross.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.692
No, you're not, you're beautiful.

25:26.775 --> 25:28.068
Mm-mm. I'm ugly.

25:28.861 --> 25:32.364
On the outside and on the inside.
I hurt Bob, I hurt you.

25:32.448 --> 25:33.699
I forgive you.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.784
Yeah, you shouldn't and he hasn't.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.369
Patty, stop!

25:37.995 --> 25:39.663
When you're mad at yourself
about something,

25:39.747 --> 25:41.957
- you always decide that you're fat.
- I am fat.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.294
I'm disgusting, and fat, and awful
and I don't deserve to live.

25:45.377 --> 25:47.463
Stop being mean to my best friend.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.637
You're the most beautiful person
I've ever met,

25:56.513 --> 25:58.182
even before you got thin.

26:00.809 --> 26:01.852
I don't see it.

26:03.520 --> 26:07.149
Sometimes other people see things
in you that you can't see for yourself.

26:11.862 --> 26:13.322
Everyone thinks I'm gay.

26:15.199 --> 26:17.785
Including Donald Choi,
who I made out with.

26:18.535 --> 26:21.038
Wait, you made out with Choi?
You're not gay.

26:21.121 --> 26:23.791
And besides,
nobody knows you better than me.

26:23.874 --> 26:26.293
If you were gay, I would know, trust me.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.007
Trust me.

26:32.841 --> 26:34.468
You look amazing in that bikini.

26:36.470 --> 26:37.638
You should buy it.

26:48.315 --> 26:51.693
<i>I was willing to do whatever it took
to win Coralee back,</i>

26:51.777 --> 26:55.739
<i>even if it meant taking a meeting
with Bob Boy Barbie Barnard.</i>

26:56.907 --> 26:59.493
Do you have to do that right now?

26:59.576 --> 27:01.245
Sorry. When you said
you were gonna be late,

27:01.328 --> 27:03.580
I thought I could squeeze in
a quick workout.

27:04.748 --> 27:07.209
We need to talk about Christian Keene.

27:07.292 --> 27:11.088
Don't need to spend time or money going
to court, he's a first time offender.

27:11.171 --> 27:14.049
I'm happy to settle
for a nominal fine, probation.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.676
Absolutely.

27:15.926 --> 27:17.845
No reason to destroy two lives.

27:19.471 --> 27:20.597
Who's the other one?

27:21.140 --> 27:23.433
- Magnolia.
- What are you talking about?

27:23.517 --> 27:25.727
She's one of his clients.

27:25.811 --> 27:29.523
There is no way
that Magnolia is a drug user.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.024
She's a straight-A student.

27:31.608 --> 27:36.697
Well, have you noticed
any changes in her behavior recently?

27:40.159 --> 27:42.661
She has been saying that
she's over doing pageants.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.663
Classic sign.

27:45.164 --> 27:48.625
Apathy, losing interest
in something you used to love.

27:49.251 --> 27:52.421
If Christian's selling drugs,
he's a danger to all our kids.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.631
He should be behind bars,
I'm not settling.

27:54.715 --> 27:56.175
He's going to jail.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.803
Oh...

28:00.262 --> 28:03.599
My client will be so disappointed.

28:04.516 --> 28:05.851
You heard from Coralee?

28:06.935 --> 28:07.936
What?

28:08.645 --> 28:09.855
- Why?
- Eh...

28:09.938 --> 28:10.939
She called me.

28:11.023 --> 28:15.777
Said she needed a place to stay
while the two of you "figured things out."

28:15.861 --> 28:17.487
- She called you?
- Mm.

28:17.988 --> 28:19.531
Is she staying at your house?

28:19.615 --> 28:20.490
No.

28:20.574 --> 28:23.368
Let's just say I have some real estate.

28:23.994 --> 28:28.373
But she made me promise not to tell you
where she is and I respect her.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.000
Don't worry, she's safe.

28:30.292 --> 28:33.045
Now that she has a real man
looking out for her.

28:35.255 --> 28:36.715
Where is she?

28:38.300 --> 28:39.384
Easy, Bob.

28:41.762 --> 28:43.180
Fuck you, Bob.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.850
<i>Coralee had the gall to ask me
to compromise my ethics</i>

28:46.934 --> 28:51.730
<i>after she had gone to the one person
she knew I hated the most?</i>

28:51.980 --> 28:53.941
<i>It felt like a kick in the nuts.</i>

28:54.942 --> 28:58.278
<i>Forget throwing the case,
Coralee would have to understand,</i>

28:58.362 --> 29:00.530
<i>I couldn't abandon my pageant dreams.</i>

29:00.614 --> 29:04.493
<i>If I wanted a chance at being a winner,
I needed to find a way to help Patty.</i>

29:08.163 --> 29:10.874
You can wait in here.
My dad should be home any minute.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.417
Thanks.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.340
Listen, I know you talked to my dad
behind my back.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.841
That's not cool.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.426
I'm sorry.

29:22.636 --> 29:24.888
I just thought it was so messed up,
what you told me.

29:24.972 --> 29:27.975
And you made things worse.
He told me a bunch of inappropriate shit.

29:28.058 --> 29:31.019
It was just the most
uncomfortable conversation ever.

29:31.478 --> 29:33.939
At least a bad conversation
is better than no conversation.

29:35.357 --> 29:38.443
I'm not trying to defend myself,
I'm just saying I've never met my dad.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.237
So at least you two were talking.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.115
And I would give anything
for one conversation with him,

29:43.198 --> 29:44.783
even an uncomfortable one.

29:46.034 --> 29:49.288
But that doesn't give me the right to
get all up in your business and I'm sorry.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.999
No, I'm sorry... about your dad.

29:52.082 --> 29:54.251
And I appreciate you
sticking up for me like that.

29:55.585 --> 29:59.339
I mean, you may have
actually helped, so...

30:01.383 --> 30:02.217
thank you.

30:06.221 --> 30:08.015
Do you want me
to sit with you while you wait?

30:08.098 --> 30:10.017
Or I could get you a soda, or...?

30:10.100 --> 30:13.145
Hey, Brick, Patty. I'm glad you're here.

30:14.604 --> 30:18.066
I'll, uh, let you two
get down to business.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.990
I want to help you get back
into Miss Magic Jesus.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.410
So, you're not still mad at me?

30:28.493 --> 30:30.829
I am. I'm just more mad at Coralee.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.122
Why? What did she do?

30:33.457 --> 30:34.499
It doesn't matter.

30:34.583 --> 30:37.753
From now on,
my personal life is off limits to you.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.505
The point is,
I want to win Christian's case.

30:40.589 --> 30:43.300
Great. Then he'll help me figure out
who hacked my phone.

30:43.383 --> 30:46.136
Now that I'm planning my bikini dog wash,
I'll look better to the board.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.304
Your bikini what?

30:47.387 --> 30:49.848
- Dog wash.
- What? Is that even a thing?

30:49.931 --> 30:52.267
It's a charity event
to add to my pageant resume.

30:52.351 --> 30:55.062
Why didn't you tell me I needed
a philanthropy to win Miss Magic Jesus?

30:55.145 --> 30:57.689
'Cause I was a little busy
proving you weren't a murderer

30:57.773 --> 31:00.359
and keeping you from ending up face down
in a puddle of chocolate!

31:02.944 --> 31:04.696
So, you'll win Christian's case?

31:04.780 --> 31:06.490
I've said I wanted to.

31:06.573 --> 31:10.118
The problem is, now Barnard knows
Christian sold drugs to Magnolia.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.037
He won't stop
till Christian is behind bars.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.580
But Christian said he wasn't dealing.

31:13.663 --> 31:16.291
Can't you get Magnolia to testify
he was just holding them for her?

31:17.751 --> 31:18.835
No.

31:18.919 --> 31:21.713
But you may have just figured out
a way to keep Christian out of jail.

31:24.174 --> 31:27.886
Why are you helping Patty Bladell with
her stupid eating disorder fundraiser?

31:27.969 --> 31:30.347
You are a horrible gremlin. Please leave.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.142
That bikini makes you look fat.

31:38.563 --> 31:40.065
Dixie, what part of...?

31:40.273 --> 31:41.566
What the hell are these?

31:43.402 --> 31:45.028
You can't search my room
without a warrant.

31:45.112 --> 31:48.573
I certainly can, as your father.
Are you doing this to get back at me?

31:49.533 --> 31:50.492
For what?

31:50.951 --> 31:53.328
Forcing me to do pageants
when I told you I was done?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.956
Inviting a pocket-sized Satan
to live in our house,

31:56.039 --> 31:58.417
without considering for one second
how that might affect me?

31:58.500 --> 32:01.711
Or for not telling me that my boyfriend
was cheating on me?

32:01.795 --> 32:03.839
No, do not turn this around.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.299
This is serious.
You are screwing up your life.

32:06.383 --> 32:09.261
Don't you mean
I'm screwing up your reputation?

32:09.344 --> 32:11.721
- This isn't about me.
- Of course it is.

32:11.805 --> 32:15.100
I am so tired
of having to be perfect all the time.

32:17.144 --> 32:19.771
I can't make a mistake,
I can't get a bad grade.

32:19.855 --> 32:23.316
I can't even leave my room without
looking like I'm off to a fashion shoot.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.403
I am so over being Magnolia Barnard.

32:34.578 --> 32:36.163
All right. I understand.

32:37.581 --> 32:43.128
It's hard having to keep up
the Barnard image all the time.

32:44.004 --> 32:46.256
And mom is away from home so much.

32:47.132 --> 32:49.092
Come on, we got to be a team, huh?

32:49.426 --> 32:51.595
Come on. Come here.

32:52.345 --> 32:54.139
I'm here for you, Magnolia.

32:54.848 --> 33:00.520
Okay? And I promise, we will win
Miss Magic Jesus and Miss American Lady

33:00.604 --> 33:02.606
and then we'll get you
whatever help you need.

33:02.689 --> 33:05.025
Hmm?

33:05.108 --> 33:06.193
Who's that?

33:08.820 --> 33:12.073
I got to go take care of this, sweetheart,
but I'm glad we talked.

33:18.455 --> 33:21.082
What's this about?
You gonna try to beat me up again?

33:21.500 --> 33:24.836
Oh, no, I am sorry about that.

33:24.920 --> 33:28.924
And since you were kind enough
to give me the heads up about Coralee,

33:29.007 --> 33:31.301
I wanted to give you a heads up
about Magnolia.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.469
- Another one?
- Mm-hm.

33:32.552 --> 33:36.973
I've complied a short list of witnesses
for Christian Keene's case

33:37.057 --> 33:39.684
and I wanted to warn ya,
Magnolia is on it.

33:40.936 --> 33:41.770
Wait, what?

33:41.853 --> 33:45.565
Well, Christian insists that
he was holding drugs for her...

33:45.649 --> 33:48.568
and that makes her the only person
that can attest to the fact that

33:48.652 --> 33:50.570
he didn't have any intent to distribute.

33:50.654 --> 33:52.656
Now you said he sold her those drugs.

33:52.739 --> 33:55.367
Do you really want her
to say that from the stand?

33:56.117 --> 33:59.996
I know how damaging that can be,
what with Miss Magic Jesus coming up,

34:00.080 --> 34:03.083
but some things are not preventable.

34:03.291 --> 34:06.169
So, I just wanted to let you know,

34:06.253 --> 34:09.839
'cause I know you would do
the same thing for me.

34:10.632 --> 34:11.841
Mm-hm.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.554
What would you say to a nominal fine
and community service?

34:18.306 --> 34:20.766
What do you mean, you can't figure out
who hacked Patty's phone?

34:20.850 --> 34:22.310
That was your end of the deal!

34:22.393 --> 34:24.563
I'm sorry, it's a sophisticated hack.

34:24.646 --> 34:28.149
Whoever had it out for Patty
is some kind of criminal mastermind.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.193
Ugh. Bullshit, you played me.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.696
Maybe you shouldn't have trusted
a drug dealer.

34:34.656 --> 34:35.991
I can't believe you.

34:36.533 --> 34:38.702
You took advantage of me
because you knew I liked you.

34:38.784 --> 34:39.911
I didn't know...

34:41.663 --> 34:42.706
until now.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.417
Thanks for keeping me out of jail.

34:50.255 --> 34:52.632
There has to be another way
to figure out who hacked my phone.

34:52.716 --> 34:55.302
Maybe there is. Christian is right.

34:55.385 --> 34:58.096
There is at least one criminal
who has it out for you.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.515
Or, more accurately, for us.

35:02.601 --> 35:03.685
Regina.

35:03.768 --> 35:08.607
Now, she is no mastermind, but she is
certainly in jail surrounded by a few.

35:09.190 --> 35:12.027
I can call over there
and see if Regina's in close proximity

35:12.110 --> 35:13.862
to any tech-savvy criminals.

35:19.326 --> 35:22.621
Oh, I like that.
Oh, I like that a lot.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.374
Wait, what are you...?

35:27.667 --> 35:28.752
Hello?

35:30.545 --> 35:31.713
It's for you.

35:32.005 --> 35:35.759
Oh! I hope you don't mind,
I gave my daughter this number.

35:36.176 --> 35:38.011
- Hello.
- Hi, Mama.

35:38.094 --> 35:40.388
Hi, baby. How's everything going?

35:40.472 --> 35:41.723
Not good.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.267
Everyone's been talking about my wigwam.

35:44.351 --> 35:46.936
<i>Well, what did you think would happen?</i>

35:47.020 --> 35:49.814
Sending out that picture was your idea.

35:49.898 --> 35:52.567
Yeah, to get Patty disqualified.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.195
But I figured everyone
would just think I'm a slut.

35:55.278 --> 35:58.073
Now they think I'm a lesbian
and that's way worse.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.949
Oh, honey.

36:00.283 --> 36:02.494
Everyone's a little gay.

36:02.744 --> 36:05.163
Besides, you should be grateful.

36:05.246 --> 36:08.708
It is a gift from God that my cellmate
happens to be a cyber-terrorist

36:08.792 --> 36:11.961
and she was able to hack
into Patty's phone.

36:12.587 --> 36:16.966
And you have no idea
what she made me do for payment.

36:20.095 --> 36:21.096
<i>Sorry, baby. I got to run.</i>

36:23.390 --> 36:24.224
Four.

36:24.766 --> 36:25.684
Five!

36:26.226 --> 36:27.102
- Six.
- Shelby!

36:27.185 --> 36:28.353
Got you a visitor.

36:29.646 --> 36:30.480
Done.

36:31.106 --> 36:34.442
<i>I pulled a favor with one of
the ladies who works admin at the prison.</i>

36:34.526 --> 36:36.736
<i>We swapped fashion tips for information.</i>

36:37.570 --> 36:40.990
<i>Lo and behold,
there was a cyber-terrorist in residence</i>

36:41.074 --> 36:46.246
<i>who happened to be cellmates
with none other than Regina Sinclair.</i>

36:46.871 --> 36:47.831
I'm Bob Armstrong.

36:49.999 --> 36:53.253
I, uh... I'm pretty sure
there's no touching allowed.

36:53.336 --> 36:54.796
But Ramon likes to watch.

36:55.630 --> 36:59.342
I've had my tired-of-bars and convicted-
to-love profiles up for over a year

36:59.426 --> 37:02.137
and I even hacked myself
onto the front page of both,

37:02.220 --> 37:04.264
and you're the first man to respond.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.725
Actually, I'm an attorney.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.017
Oh, well, good for you.

37:08.101 --> 37:09.644
Ramon, get us in the mood.

37:10.145 --> 37:13.231
Wait, what are you doing? Stop! Stop it!

37:13.857 --> 37:16.484
You want to peel the banana yourself?
That's even hotter.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.777
No. No peeling!

37:18.653 --> 37:20.238
I am here on business.

37:20.321 --> 37:22.198
- This isn't a conjugal?
- No.

37:24.033 --> 37:28.413
I know you hacked my client's cell phone
on behalf of Regina Sinclair.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.875
It is only a matter of time
before I have proof.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.960
Well, good luck with that.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.546
'Cause I'm a hacker,
I always cover my tracks.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.548
Shelby, I need your help.

37:38.965 --> 37:43.011
Those photos have wreaked havoc
on an innocent young girl's life.

37:43.094 --> 37:44.888
I used to be young too.

37:44.971 --> 37:46.723
And now I'm drying up like a prune.

37:46.806 --> 37:49.017
I might be able to help with that.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.894
That is, if you confess.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.812
I can't confess.

37:52.896 --> 37:56.191
I only got two weeks left on my sentence.
I can't risk not getting out.

37:56.775 --> 37:59.068
What if you pinned it on Regina Sinclair?

37:59.861 --> 38:01.738
And then you'll give me what I want?

38:04.491 --> 38:06.868
<i>I wasn't sure
I could go through with it.</i>

38:07.368 --> 38:10.246
<i>But my pageant-coaching future
was at stake.</i>

38:10.914 --> 38:13.541
<i>So, I did what I had to do.</i>

38:17.253 --> 38:18.713
I look like a lady.

38:19.255 --> 38:20.381
Give me your burner.

38:20.465 --> 38:24.844
<i>In both my legal and pageant careers,
I'd never worked harder on a client,</i>

38:24.928 --> 38:27.555
<i>but the results were spectacular.</i>

38:27.639 --> 38:28.556
Mmm...

38:29.015 --> 38:32.018
Maybe don't smile. It's more mysterious.

38:34.896 --> 38:39.526
Online dating is just like a pageant,
you got to put your best face forward.

38:39.609 --> 38:41.861
As soon as you upload that photo,
I promise,

38:41.945 --> 38:44.155
you are gonna have conjugals up the wazoo.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.866
How'd you know I like it up there?

39:10.223 --> 39:12.600
<i>With Bob on the case
of who hacked my phone,</i>

39:12.684 --> 39:15.019
<i>I could turn my focus back to my dog wash.</i>

39:16.187 --> 39:19.524
<i>Magnolia and her friends looked like
they were having so much fun.</i>

39:19.941 --> 39:22.443
<i>I can't imagine feeling that comfortable
in my own skin.</i>

39:23.111 --> 39:24.153
Why aren't you in a bikini?

39:25.363 --> 39:27.782
- Ladies!
- Oh, this can't be good.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.951
Y'all need to stay hydrated
and protect yourselves

39:30.034 --> 39:32.453
from those cancer-causing "Oove" rays.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.956
Dixie, what are you doing here?

39:35.039 --> 39:40.003
Oh, you know, letting bygones be bygones.
Let me rub sunscreen on your back.

39:41.588 --> 39:44.716
Dixie, you're here.
I was hoping for a little better turnout.

39:46.551 --> 39:49.262
You know what gets more attention
than girls in bikinis?

39:49.345 --> 39:52.307
Girls in bikinis
rubbing oil on each other.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.019
I mean, she's not wrong.

39:56.352 --> 39:58.479
Are you sure we should,
like, sexualize ourselves?

39:58.563 --> 40:00.565
Yeah, it's for a good cause, girl.

40:01.399 --> 40:05.528
Ladies, grab your sunscreen.
We are going live! Whoo!

40:06.154 --> 40:07.196
Yes!

40:07.655 --> 40:11.284
Yes. Get all good and oiled up.
You go, girl.

40:13.870 --> 40:15.163
Patty, where's your suit?

40:15.246 --> 40:17.582
This is your event. Get in on this, girl.

40:19.125 --> 40:20.627
The camera adds ten pounds.

40:21.085 --> 40:24.047
- I thought I can do this, I can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

40:24.130 --> 40:26.090
It's all in your head. Be brave.

40:26.174 --> 40:28.801
Screw brave, I want to be thinner.

40:31.095 --> 40:34.599
Oh my God! Brick is here,
with the world's tiniest dog.

40:34.682 --> 40:36.476
I can't let him see me in a bikini.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.939
Excuse me. How much for a deluxe wash
and a second chance?

40:41.022 --> 40:42.982
Isn't that dog a little young?

40:43.441 --> 40:45.401
I thought you were into older bitches.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.363
Get out of my face.

40:52.367 --> 40:53.284
Bye.

40:54.744 --> 40:56.871
It's slobbering all over me!

41:00.041 --> 41:02.293
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.

41:03.878 --> 41:05.171
No. No, down!

41:06.339 --> 41:07.799
Ew! Stop it, get off!

41:08.967 --> 41:09.842
Get off!

41:09.926 --> 41:11.678
Oh, my God! It's like dogmageddon!

41:16.724 --> 41:18.101
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.273
Get off!

41:24.357 --> 41:25.566
Wait. Come back. No.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.446
SPF meat, bitches!

41:33.157 --> 41:34.659
What happened?

41:35.785 --> 41:38.746
That stupid tritch spiked our sunscreen
with bacon grease.

41:39.372 --> 41:40.498
Tritch.

41:40.957 --> 41:42.792
Troll plus bitch, I like.

41:43.376 --> 41:44.794
Screw this, I'm out!

41:47.380 --> 41:48.423
Well, great.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.801
Now my chances of winning
Miss Magic Jesus have gone to shit.

41:53.636 --> 41:57.473
- Anything I can do to help?
- Wanna put on a bikini and wash 50 dogs?

41:59.308 --> 42:03.271
Uh, no.
But I do know some ladies who might.

42:05.148 --> 42:06.190
One second.

42:13.740 --> 42:15.908
You threw me under the bus,
you cyber-slut.

42:15.992 --> 42:18.202
I didn't hack Patty's phone, you did!

42:18.453 --> 42:21.414
No! Stop it, I just got a makeover!

42:21.497 --> 42:23.708
Oh, yeah, pretty lady? Yeah?

42:24.125 --> 42:26.919
Who's pretty now? Bitch!

42:27.003 --> 42:29.005
You like your little hair, Pretty Pony?

42:29.505 --> 42:32.759
Oh, I'll show you pretty!
I'll show you pretty!

42:51.694 --> 42:52.904
Who are they?

42:52.987 --> 42:54.822
How does Brick know them?

42:54.906 --> 42:56.824
Where did they get their shoes?

42:56.908 --> 42:58.493
I can't believe Brick did this.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.953
Maybe he does deserve a second chance.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.832
Patty? These are my friends
from the LGBTQ Center.

43:05.416 --> 43:07.210
They've been tweeting
about it on the way over.

43:07.293 --> 43:08.461
It's gonna be huge.

43:09.087 --> 43:12.381
Brick, this is amazing. Thank you.

43:24.018 --> 43:27.730
I got to admit,
the Brick Armstrong I know,

43:27.814 --> 43:32.610
does not hang out with LGBTQ people
or help girls with eating disorders.

43:33.569 --> 43:34.987
Maybe I misjudged you.

43:36.864 --> 43:40.868
Yeah, well, Patty's cool and smart
and a really good person, so...

43:42.036 --> 43:43.746
Wait, you did this for Patty?

43:43.830 --> 43:45.039
Yeah, it's her charity.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.874
But I helped plan it.

43:47.792 --> 43:52.296
I thought you did this for me, as,
like, a grand gesture to win me back.

43:52.380 --> 43:53.214
Seriously?

43:53.297 --> 43:56.342
Patty is out here trying to help people
and you're thinking of yourself.

43:58.344 --> 44:02.431
Wow, if you think Patty's so cool,
you can hang out with her.

44:03.099 --> 44:04.267
I'm going home.

44:06.269 --> 44:09.230
Ladies, let's get fur-ocious!

44:37.592 --> 44:40.344
<i>It was my event
and I still felt left out.</i>

44:41.095 --> 44:42.722
<i>It was a bikini dog wash</i>

44:42.805 --> 44:45.725
<i>and I still couldn't bring myself
to put on that bikini.</i>

44:52.773 --> 44:53.816
Hey.

44:54.400 --> 44:56.319
Are you with the LGBTQ Center?

44:57.528 --> 44:58.738
What gave it away?

45:01.157 --> 45:02.116
When...?

45:04.202 --> 45:07.121
When did you know you were someone who...

45:08.831 --> 45:11.626
goes to the LGBTQ Center?

45:15.713 --> 45:16.756
Uh...

45:17.882 --> 45:21.260
I think I always knew,
but I kept trying to convince myself

45:21.344 --> 45:25.306
that it was just, like,
regular 15-year-old girl stuff, you know.

45:25.389 --> 45:27.975
Like, before I realized
<i>Heavenly Creatures</i> is a gay movie.

45:28.059 --> 45:30.269
- It is?
- Yeah, dude.

45:30.353 --> 45:33.105
Melanie Lynskey
is in love with Kate Winslet.

45:33.606 --> 45:37.151
And I was obsessed with my best friend.

45:37.526 --> 45:39.946
Totally jealous when
she got her first boyfriend,

45:40.029 --> 45:41.864
but I didn't think that made me gay.

45:42.323 --> 45:47.119
And then I saw her making out with a guy
and I wanted to die.

45:48.412 --> 45:49.872
That's when I knew.

45:58.839 --> 46:00.258
I do that too.

46:01.801 --> 46:04.887
I get stuck in the mirror,
looking at my body,

46:05.888 --> 46:07.223
wishing it were different.

46:07.640 --> 46:09.725
You have an amazing body.

46:10.268 --> 46:11.352
So do you.

46:12.770 --> 46:16.065
I... I used to be fat.

46:17.024 --> 46:18.359
I used to be a guy.

46:18.609 --> 46:19.902
Shit, really?

46:20.319 --> 46:25.574
Well, no. I mean, I've always been a girl,
I just had the body of a guy.

46:27.034 --> 46:28.369
I'm trans.

46:28.661 --> 46:31.497
If anyone understands feeling
uncomfortable in their own skin,

46:32.373 --> 46:33.457
it's me.

46:34.750 --> 46:38.379
I thought once I had my surgery,
I'd feel better about myself.

46:39.755 --> 46:42.258
I'm still not comfortable
wearing a bathing suit.

46:44.135 --> 46:48.222
I keep thinking there's gonna be a day
where I feel female enough.

46:49.765 --> 46:50.933
Yeah.

46:51.434 --> 46:55.104
I think I'll feel thin enough
when I lose another ten pounds.

46:56.355 --> 47:00.484
I just... keep wishing I looked perfect.

47:03.446 --> 47:08.117
Sometimes I wonder if
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life

47:08.617 --> 47:09.994
waiting for it to start.

47:11.746 --> 47:12.705
Me too.

47:15.166 --> 47:16.167
Maybe we don't have to.

47:35.853 --> 47:37.355
I feel so...

47:37.772 --> 47:38.606
Free.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.358
No, I was gonna say
totally self-conscious.

47:40.441 --> 47:41.817
- Thank God, me too.
- Okay.

47:41.901 --> 47:43.527
- Baby steps.
- Baby steps.

47:44.195 --> 47:45.196
Patty.

47:47.615 --> 47:49.283
Uh, hey, I'll catch up with you.

47:52.286 --> 47:54.538
This is amazing. I'm proud of you.

47:56.707 --> 47:58.209
Does that mean you forgive me?

47:58.834 --> 48:00.169
It means I understand, yes.

48:00.878 --> 48:04.924
Nobody's perfect.
Not you, not me, not Coralee.

48:05.591 --> 48:08.219
Believe me,
you did a really messed up thing,

48:08.844 --> 48:10.596
but also,
you're trying to make things right.

48:10.679 --> 48:12.640
Your heart's in the right place.

48:12.765 --> 48:14.809
And I know you'd never
hurt anyone on purpose.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.770
Well, the homeless guy. And Coralee.

48:18.813 --> 48:20.022
Don't make me change my mind.

48:21.399 --> 48:24.443
Regina Sinclair hacked your phone,
I got proof.

48:24.527 --> 48:27.863
I alerted the Miss Magic Jesus Board.
So you're back in.

48:27.947 --> 48:30.241
Oh, my God. Thank you.

48:30.366 --> 48:31.283
Dad!

48:31.367 --> 48:33.953
I talked to Mom and she said
whatever you were doing to fix things,

48:34.036 --> 48:35.996
you screwed up, so, good job.

48:36.080 --> 48:39.166
Yeah, maybe tell your mother,
if she hadn't gone running to...

48:40.042 --> 48:42.002
You know what? Never mind.

48:42.086 --> 48:44.380
Your mother and I
have a lot to work through.

48:44.463 --> 48:45.798
It's best you don't get involved.

48:45.881 --> 48:48.050
There's no reason
to put you in the middle.

48:49.135 --> 48:52.680
Bob, again, I'm truly sorry.

48:53.848 --> 48:57.184
Just win Miss Magic Jesus,
Miss American Lady

48:57.268 --> 49:01.439
and then maybe we can both make
all this worth the trouble.

49:03.899 --> 49:05.025
Uh, hey, Brick.

49:07.445 --> 49:08.279
You okay?

49:09.905 --> 49:11.365
I mean, no, but yeah.

49:13.784 --> 49:16.287
You saved my ass today. Thank you.

49:16.370 --> 49:20.583
Thank you... for caring about me
enough to talk with my dad.

49:24.879 --> 49:26.755
So, maybe you could, like,
take me out to coffee?

49:26.839 --> 49:28.674
Say thank you for earlier, you know.

49:29.175 --> 49:30.301
Like a date.

49:32.094 --> 49:35.181
I get it. I'm thinner now,
so you're suddenly interested.

49:35.723 --> 49:36.682
No!

49:37.349 --> 49:41.312
I mean, you... you look great,
but I really like talking to you.

49:42.104 --> 49:45.733
I've said more to you in the last few days
than I've said to Magnolia in a year.

49:47.151 --> 49:50.362
Which is weird for me, because usually,
when I like talking to someone,

49:52.907 --> 49:54.366
I don't also want to do this.

50:04.168 --> 50:06.921
