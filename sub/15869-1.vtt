A collector's piece indeed...

03:43.558 --> 03:48.847
every detail exactly as she said...

03:49.643 --> 03:57.254
Will you still play, when all the rest of us are dead...

03:57.289 --> 04:03.225
Lot 666, then: a chandelier in pieces.

04:03.259 --> 04:12.364
Some of you may recall the strange affair
of the Phantom of the Opera: a mystery never fully explained.

04:12.398 --> 04:21.466
We are told, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the
very chandelier which figures in the famous disaster.

04:21.503 --> 04:26.244
Our workshops have repaired it and wired
parts of it for the new electric light

04:26.645 --> 04:31.467
Perhaps we can frighten away the ghost of so many years ago

04:32.262 --> 04:37.353
with a little illumination, gentlemen

05:34.751 --> 05:38.267
Paris 1870

07:16.470 --> 07:18.183
"Opera Populaire"

07:18.478 --> 07:21.167
"La Carlotta"

07:21.763 --> 07:26.787
This trophy from our saviours,

07:26.822 --> 07:33.754
From our saviours

07:34.448 --> 07:42.860
From the enslaving force of Rome!

07:44.553 --> 07:45.230
Madame

07:45.264 --> 07:47.784
With feasting and dancing and song,

07:47.817 --> 07:50.535
tonight in celebration,

07:50.570 --> 07:53.256
we greet the victorious throng,

07:53.291 --> 07:55.978
returned to bring salvation!

08:04.767 --> 08:06.076
Vicomte, welcome

08:07.783 --> 08:10.172
The trumpets of Carthage resound!

08:10.469 --> 08:13.306
Hear, Romans, now and tremble!

08:13.339 --> 08:16.176
Hark to our step on the ground!

08:16.212 --> 08:20.237
Hear the drums

08:20.273 --> 08:24.268
Hannibal comes!

08:26.784 --> 08:35.878
Sad to return to find the land we love
threatened once more by Roma's far-reaching grasp.

08:35.912 --> 08:37.149
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

08:37.184 --> 08:41.066
Rehearsals, as you see, are under way,
for a new production of Chalumeau's 'Hannibal'.

08:41.101 --> 08:43.732
M. Lefevre, I am rehearsing.

08:43.769 --> 08:49.474
M. Reyer, Mme. Giry, ladies and gentlemen, please,
if I can have your attention, thank you

08:49.509 --> 08:52.659
As you know, for some weeks there
have been rumours of my imminent retirement.

08:53.165 --> 08:58.528
I can now tell you that these were all true,
and it is my pleasure to introduce to you

08:58.563 --> 09:03.878
the two gentlemen who now own the Opera Populaire,
M. Richard Firmin and M. Gilles Andre.

09:05.978 --> 09:09.573
I'm sure you've read that recent fortune in the junk business

09:09.607 --> 09:11.662
scrap metal, actually

09:13.678 --> 09:14.749
He must be rich

09:14.783 --> 09:22.165
And we're deeply honored to introduce
our new patron, the Vicomte de Chagny

09:27.385 --> 09:34.385
It's Raoul, before my father died, at the house by the sea...

09:35.281 --> 09:38.478
I guess you could say we were childhood sweethearts

09:38.976 --> 09:40.767
He called me Little Lotte

09:40.802 --> 09:42.577
Christine, he's so handsome

09:43.082 --> 09:45.877
My parents and I are honored to support all the arts

09:45.913 --> 09:48.379
Especially the world-renowned Opera Populaire

09:49.971 --> 09:55.578
Gentlemen, Signora Carlitta Guidicelli
our leading soprano for five seasons now.

09:55.613 --> 09:56.580
Bravo! Bravo!

09:57.482 --> 09:58.977
Signor Ubaldo Piangi.

10:04.282 --> 10:07.585
An honour, Signor. I believe
I'm keeping you for your rehearsal

10:07.618 --> 10:10.568
I will be here this evening to
share your great triumph

10:10.602 --> 10:11.743
My apologies, monsieur

10:11.780 --> 10:15.679
Thank you, M. Le Vicomte, once more
if you please, Signor

10:15.713 --> 10:17.383
He love me, he love me

10:23.388 --> 10:25.081
He wouldn't recognize me

10:25.116 --> 10:26.041
He didn't see you

10:26.076 --> 10:27.482
If you please, monsieur

10:31.784 --> 10:34.383
We take a particular pride in the
excellence of our ballets, monsieur

10:34.418 --> 10:39.274
I see why, especially that little blonde angel

10:39.308 --> 10:41.183
My daughter, Meg Giry

10:41.688 --> 10:46.243
And that exceptional beauty, no relation I trust

10:46.277 --> 10:50.680
Christine Daae, promising talent
M. Firmin, very promising

10:52.593 --> 10:57.482
Daae, you say? No relation to the
famous Swedish violinist?

10:57.879 --> 11:03.289
His only child, orphaned at seven when she came
to live and trained in the ballet dormitories.

11:03.323 --> 11:05.542
An orphan, you said?

11:05.576 --> 11:07.646
I think of her as a daughter also

11:07.680 --> 11:10.585
Gentlemen, if you would kindly stand to one side

11:12.194 --> 11:15.144
Hannibals friends!

11:15.179 --> 11:17.183
Oh no, not on my dress, why?

11:26.581 --> 11:29.483
The trumpeting elephants sound -

11:29.784 --> 11:32.790
hear, Romans, now and tremble!

11:33.090 --> 11:36.177
Hark to their step on the ground -

11:36.213 --> 11:38.678
hear the drums!

11:40.190 --> 11:47.382
Hannibal comes!

11:54.881 --> 11:57.781
Ah Daae, all that they want is your dancing

11:58.281 --> 12:00.802
Vicomte is very excited about tonight's gala

12:06.681 --> 12:10.701
He's excited by dancing girls as your new managers

12:10.801 --> 12:13.388
Because I will not be singing

12:14.285 --> 12:15.676
Goodbye, everyone

12:15.711 --> 12:17.049
Now it's finished

12:17.083 --> 12:19.094
Get my doggie, bring my doggie. Bye bye

12:19.798 --> 12:20.701
What do we do?

12:21.197 --> 12:23.586
- Grovel, grovel, grovel
- Right

12:23.885 --> 12:25.575
See you later, because I'm going out

12:25.875 --> 12:26.883
It is finished

12:28.089 --> 12:29.903
Principessa. Bella diva

12:30.103 --> 12:32.591
- Si si
- Goddess of song

12:33.983 --> 12:38.494
Mr. Reyer, isn't there a rather marvelous
aria for Elisa in Act Three of 'Hannibal'?

12:38.997 --> 12:41.495
Yes, yes, yes. Ma no!

12:41.993 --> 12:46.075
Because I have not my costume for act 3
because somebody not finish it!

12:46.176 --> 12:48.699
And I hate my hat!

12:48.900 --> 12:51.893
I wonder, Signora, as a personal favour
if you would oblige us

12:52.191 --> 12:53.552
with a private rendition

12:53.586 --> 12:55.975
Unless, of course, M. Reyer objects...

12:56.075 --> 12:57.392
No. Aspetta, aspetta.
(No, Attesa, attesa)

13:04.382 --> 13:07.093
If my managers command...

13:09.307 --> 13:10.564
M. Reyer?

13:10.600 --> 13:13.785
if My diva commands?
Yes, I do

13:14.780 --> 13:16.244
Everybody be quiet

13:16.280 --> 13:18.707
Monsieur Lefevre, why exactly are you retiring?

13:18.742 --> 13:20.418
My health
I see

13:20.453 --> 13:22.093
You as well

13:25.178 --> 13:26.792
Signora?

13:27.097 --> 13:28.909
Maestro.

13:33.983 --> 13:39.306
Think of me, think of me, fondly

13:39.340 --> 13:46.085
When we've said goodbye

13:46.392 --> 13:52.838
Remember me once in a while

13:52.874 --> 13:57.650
Please promise me you'll try

13:57.685 --> 14:02.179
When you find that once again

14:02.214 --> 14:06.701
You long to take your heart...

14:13.783 --> 14:15.184
Signora!

14:18.907 --> 14:20.699
He's here:the Phantom of the Opera...

14:20.733 --> 14:21.396
Signora! Are you all right?

14:21.594 --> 14:24.182
Buquet! For God's sake, man, what's going on there?

14:24.381 --> 14:25.588
Please, monsieur, don't look at me:

14:26.400 --> 14:28.510
as God's my judge, I was not at my post.

14:29.804 --> 14:30.898
Please, monsieur,

14:30.933 --> 14:31.992
there's no one there:

14:32.390 --> 14:36.403
Or if there is, well then, it must be a ghost...

14:41.993 --> 14:45.660
Signora, these things do happen.

14:45.693 --> 14:48.610
For the past years, these things do happen

14:48.644 --> 14:51.461
And did you stop them from happening? No!

14:51.495 --> 14:55.498
And you two, you are as bad as them, these things do happen

14:57.114 --> 14:59.308
Until you stop these things from happening

14:59.343 --> 15:01.264
This thing does not happen!

15:01.299 --> 15:05.200
Ubaldo! Andiamo!
Bring my doggy, and my boxy

15:05.234 --> 15:06.915
Amateurs!

15:08.212 --> 15:11.691
Now you see. Byebye I'm leaving

15:12.990 --> 15:14.865
Gentlemen. Good luck.

15:14.900 --> 15:16.719
If you need me, I shall be in Australia.

15:18.508 --> 15:22.495
Signora Guidicelli, she will be coming back, won't she?

15:22.986 --> 15:24.501
You think so, monsieur?

15:25.703 --> 15:28.104
I have a message, sir, from the Opera Ghost.

15:28.139 --> 15:30.566
God in heaven, you're all obsessed!

15:30.601 --> 15:32.985
He welcomes you to his opera house

15:33.027 --> 15:34.266
His opera house?

15:34.301 --> 15:35.905
And commands that you continue to?

15:36.313 --> 15:42.093
leave Box Five empty for his use and
reminds you that his salary is due.

15:42.127 --> 15:43.556
His salary?

15:43.592 --> 15:47.310
Monsieur Lefevre used to give him twenty
thousand francs a month.

15:47.344 --> 15:50.260
Twenty thousand francs?

15:50.296 --> 15:52.054
Perhaps you can afford more,

15:52.087 --> 15:53.963
with the Vicomte de Chagny as your patron.

15:53.997 --> 15:59.603
Madame, I had hoped to make that announcement public tonight
when the Vicomte was to join us at the gala

15:59.637 --> 16:05.507
But obviously we shall now have to cancel
as it appears we have lost our star.

16:06.214 --> 16:09.867
There should be a understudy

16:09.902 --> 16:12.460
Understudy? There is no understudy for La Carlotta

16:12.496 --> 16:16.412
A full house, Andre, we shall have to refund a full house.

16:16.447 --> 16:18.010
Christine Daae could sing it, sir.

16:19.602 --> 16:21.762
The chorus girl? Don't be silly

16:21.797 --> 16:23.905
She's been taking lessons from a great teacher.

16:24.509 --> 16:25.709
Who?

16:26.613 --> 16:29.801
I don't know his name, monsieur

16:30.099 --> 16:34.108
Let her sing for you, monsieur. She has been well taught.

16:35.609 --> 16:42.166
Alright, come on, don't be shy,
come on, come on

16:42.203 --> 16:47.413
Just, just...
- From the beginning of the aria, mademoiselle

16:48.607 --> 16:50.597
Andre, this is doing nothing for my nerves.

16:50.899 --> 16:52.070
She's very pretty

16:52.105 --> 16:56.410
Think of me, think of me fondly,

16:56.446 --> 17:00.361
when we've said goodbye.

17:00.398 --> 17:05.060
Remember me once in a while -

17:05.094 --> 17:09.667
please promise me you'll try.

17:09.703 --> 17:17.711
When you find that, once again, you long to
take your heart back and be free.

17:17.744 --> 17:22.310
If you ever find a moment,

17:22.711 --> 17:29.902
spare a thought for me...

17:45.209 --> 17:48.904
We never said our love was evergreen,

17:49.203 --> 17:53.467
Or as unchanging as the sea

17:53.504 --> 17:57.710
But if you can still remember,

17:58.208 --> 18:03.815
Stop and think of me...

18:04.314 --> 18:08.109
Think of all the things

18:08.144 --> 18:11.919
We've shared and seen -

18:12.318 --> 18:21.317
Don't think about the ways
things might have been...

18:21.819 --> 18:30.216
Think of me, think of me
waking silent and resigned

18:30.249 --> 18:38.611
Imagine me, trying too hard
to put you from my mind

18:38.911 --> 18:42.522
Recall those days,
look back on all those times

18:42.819 --> 18:47.277
Thinks of the things we'll never do

18:47.312 --> 18:59.920
There will never be a day
when I won't think of you

19:05.609 --> 19:06.913
Can it be?

19:07.514 --> 19:09.420
Can it be Christine?

19:11.025 --> 19:11.725
Bravo!

19:13.915 --> 19:17.665
Long ago, it seem so long ago,

19:17.701 --> 19:21.427
How young and innocent we were

19:21.625 --> 19:31.626
She may not remember me, but I remember her

19:31.660 --> 19:34.610
Flower fade, the fruit of summer fade

19:34.644 --> 19:38.989
They have their season so do we

19:39.023 --> 19:43.913
But please promise me that sometimes

19:44.310 --> 20:15.306
You will think of me!

20:33.516 --> 20:34.809
Bravo

20:35.730 --> 20:38.949
Magnifica! Stupenda!

21:29.635 --> 21:31.327
"Gustave Daae"

21:47.138 --> 21:52.519
Bravo, bravo, bravissimi

21:52.553 --> 21:57.941
Christine, Christine

22:01.025 --> 22:06.435
Where in the world have you been hiding

22:06.738 --> 22:11.225
Really, you were perfect

22:12.021 --> 22:17.143
I only wish I knew your secret

22:17.444 --> 22:22.320
Who is your great tutor

22:22.921 --> 22:24.424
Meg

22:25.327 --> 22:27.344
When your mother brought me here to live

22:29.333 --> 22:32.623
Whenever I come down here alone

22:32.657 --> 22:35.935
To light a candle for my father

22:35.970 --> 22:39.137
A voice from above

22:40.530 --> 22:43.026
And in my dreams

22:43.060 --> 22:45.533
He was always there

22:46.844 --> 22:52.489
You see, when my father lay dying

22:52.526 --> 22:56.543
He told me I would be protected by an angel

22:58.439 --> 23:01.026
An angel of music

23:01.425 --> 23:03.929
Christine, do you believe?

23:05.131 --> 23:07.543
Do you think the spirit of your father has tutored you?

23:07.577 --> 23:12.126
who... who

23:13.629 --> 23:19.332
Father once spoke of an angel

23:19.633 --> 23:24.435
I used to dream he'd appear

23:24.837 --> 23:29.133
Now as I sing, I can sense him

23:29.432 --> 23:35.441
And I know he's here

23:35.739 --> 23:40.429
Here in this room he calls me softly

23:40.464 --> 23:45.102
Somewhere inside hiding

23:45.138 --> 23:49.732
Somehow I know he's always with me

23:49.765 --> 23:54.802
He, the unseen genius

23:54.837 --> 23:58.737
Christine, you must have been dreaming

23:59.035 --> 24:03.035
Stories like this can't come true

24:03.537 --> 24:07.543
Christine, you are talking in riddles

24:07.840 --> 24:12.736
And it's not like you

24:14.039 --> 24:16.591
Angel of Music

24:16.627 --> 24:19.099
Guide and guardian

24:19.134 --> 24:25.141
Grant to me your glory
Who is this angel

24:25.176 --> 24:27.144
This...
Angle of Music

24:27.442 --> 24:30.301
Hide no longer

24:30.335 --> 24:34.841
Secret and strange angel

24:34.875 --> 24:37.907
He's with me, even now

24:37.941 --> 24:40.938
Your hands are cold

24:40.973 --> 24:42.406
All around you

24:42.440 --> 24:44.741
Your face, Christine, is white

24:44.777 --> 24:48.702
It frightens me

24:48.736 --> 24:52.641
Don't be frightened

24:58.537 --> 25:02.845
No, no

25:05.742 --> 25:07.839
You did very well, my dear

25:11.344 --> 25:12.844
He's pleased with you

25:24.243 --> 25:28.040
Ah, Vicomte, I think we've made
quite a discovery with Miss Daae

25:28.076 --> 25:30.909
Perhaps we can present her to you, dear Vicomte

25:30.944 --> 25:34.343
Gentlemen, if you wouldn't mind, this is one
visit I should prefer to make unaccompanied.

25:35.941 --> 25:37.043
Thank you

25:39.343 --> 25:41.146
It would appear they've met before
Yes

25:44.939 --> 25:48.243
Little Lotte let her mind wonder

25:49.946 --> 25:53.247
Little Lottie thought: Am I fonder of dolls

25:53.283 --> 25:55.940
or of goblins or shoes
Raoul

25:55.976 --> 25:58.345
or of riddles or frocks

25:58.845 --> 26:00.547
Those picnics in the attic

26:00.583 --> 26:02.249
or of chocolates?

26:03.844 --> 26:05.405
Father playing the violin

26:05.439 --> 26:08.947
As we read to each other dark stories of the North

26:08.981 --> 26:12.053
'No - what I love best', Lottie said,

26:12.088 --> 26:14.605
'is when I'm asleep in my bed'

26:14.642 --> 26:21.453
'and the Angel of Music sings songs in my head!'

26:21.486 --> 26:28.250
'The Angel of Music sings songs in my head!'

26:28.284 --> 26:31.453
Oh, you' sang like an angel tonight

26:33.943 --> 26:37.351
Father said, 'When I'm in heaven, child'

26:37.950 --> 26:40.853
'I will send the Angel of Music to you'.

26:42.252 --> 26:47.351
Well, father is dead, Raoul, and I have been
visited by the Angel of Music.

26:47.385 --> 26:51.354
Oh, no doubt of it - And now we'll go to supper!

26:51.754 --> 26:55.541
No, Raoul, the Angel of Music is very strict.

26:55.576 --> 26:57.252
Well, I shan't keep you up late!

26:57.286 --> 26:58.652
Raoul, no

26:59.053 --> 27:01.753
You must change. I'll order my carriage.

27:01.790 --> 27:02.947
Two minutes, Little Lottie.

27:03.446 --> 27:05.038
No, Raoul, wait!

27:55.548 --> 27:57.324
Insolent boy!

27:57.360 --> 28:00.958
This slave of fashion

28:00.992 --> 28:04.545
basking in your glory!

28:04.578 --> 28:06.723
Ignorant fool!

28:06.758 --> 28:10.610
This brave young suitor,

28:10.643 --> 28:13.537
sharing in my triumph!

28:13.571 --> 28:16.319
Angel! I hear you!

28:16.354 --> 28:19.027
Speak, I listen...

28:19.063 --> 28:23.844
stay by my side, guide me!

28:24.146 --> 28:27.461
Angel, my soul was weak -

28:27.496 --> 28:29.130
forgive me...

28:29.164 --> 28:34.247
Enter at last, Master!

28:34.282 --> 28:36.627
Flattering child

28:36.662 --> 28:38.929
you shall know me,

28:38.965 --> 28:43.914
see why in shadow I hide!

28:43.949 --> 28:48.566
Look at your face in the mirror -

28:48.600 --> 28:52.866
I am there inside!

28:52.900 --> 28:56.388
Angel of Music!

28:56.422 --> 29:01.136
Guide and guardian!

29:01.170 --> 29:05.859
Grant to me your glory!

29:06.161 --> 29:08.718
Angel of Music!

29:08.752 --> 29:11.220
Hide no longer!

29:11.254 --> 29:16.866
Come to me, strange angel

29:17.267 --> 29:22.303
I am your Angel of Music

29:22.337 --> 29:27.369
Come to me, Angel of Music

29:28.964 --> 29:30.457
Whose is that voice?

29:30.494 --> 29:31.918
Who is that in there?

29:31.953 --> 29:36.665
I am your Angel of Music
Christine, Christine

29:36.702 --> 29:42.354
Come to me: Angel of Music

30:06.065 --> 30:09.662
In sleep he sang to me

30:09.696 --> 30:13.658
In dreams he came

30:13.757 --> 30:21.160
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name

30:21.194 --> 30:28.834
And do I dream again for now I find

30:28.868 --> 30:36.472
The Phantom of the Opera is there

30:36.506 --> 30:40.760
Inside my mind

30:48.267 --> 30:51.862
Sing once again with me

30:51.896 --> 30:55.734
Our strange duet

30:55.770 --> 31:03.527
My power over you grows stronger yet

31:03.562 --> 31:12.263
And though you turn from me to glance behind

31:12.297 --> 31:19.261
The Phantom of the Opera is there

31:19.296 --> 31:23.263
Inside your mind

31:30.468 --> 31:34.172
Those who have seen your face

31:34.205 --> 31:37.843
Draw back in fear

31:37.876 --> 31:41.725
I am the mask you wear

31:41.760 --> 31:45.534
It's me they hear...

31:45.573 --> 31:54.268
My/Your spirit and your/my voice in one combined

31:54.305 --> 32:01.174
The Phantom of the Opera is there

32:01.210 --> 32:05.872
Inside your/my mind

32:10.073 --> 32:17.371
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera

32:23.573 --> 32:27.373
Sing, my Angel of Music

32:32.273 --> 32:39.073
Sing, my Angel

32:39.474 --> 32:40.772
Sing for me

32:51.473 --> 32:56.073
Sing, my Angel

32:57.777 --> 33:00.174
Sing for me

33:10.076 --> 33:14.072
I have brought you

33:14.472 --> 33:18.841
to the seat of sweet music's throne

33:18.879 --> 33:27.177
to this kingdom where all must pay homage to music

33:27.214 --> 33:29.243
music

33:29.279 --> 33:33.277
You have come here,

33:33.675 --> 33:37.580
for one purpose, and one alone

33:38.379 --> 33:42.378
Since the moment I first heard you sing,

33:42.579 --> 33:44.970
I have needed you with me,

33:45.006 --> 33:47.582
to serve me, to sing,

33:47.615 --> 33:50.481
for my music...

33:52.976 --> 33:57.680
my music...

34:03.277 --> 34:12.478
Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation.

34:12.779 --> 34:22.842
Darkness stirs and wakes imagination.

34:22.877 --> 34:32.181
Silently the senses abandon their defences

34:44.475 --> 34:52.777
Slowly, gently, night unfurls its splendour.

34:53.076 --> 35:01.384
Grasp it, sense it tremulous and tender.

35:01.684 --> 35:09.339
Turn your face away from the garish light of day,

35:09.373 --> 35:16.988
Turn your thoughts away from cold, unfeeling light -

35:17.023 --> 35:25.147
and listen to the music of the night...

35:25.181 --> 35:31.584
Close your eyes and surrender to your darkest dreams!

35:31.618 --> 35:38.190
Purge your thoughts of the life you knew before!

35:38.991 --> 35:55.586
Close your eyes, let your spirit start to soar!

35:56.993 --> 36:04.583
And you'll live as you've never lived before

36:08.393 --> 36:16.843
Softly, deftly, music shall caress you

36:16.878 --> 36:25.252
Hear it, feel it, secretly possess you

36:25.287 --> 36:32.485
Open up your mind, let your fantasies unwind,

36:32.521 --> 36:39.691
in this darkness that you know you cannot fight

36:40.088 --> 36:47.760
the darkness of the music of the night.

36:47.794 --> 36:53.585
Let your mind start a journey
through a strange, new world!

36:53.621 --> 36:59.793
Leave all thoughts of the life you knew before!

37:00.287 --> 37:11.688
Let your soul take you where you long to be!

37:14.690 --> 37:26.196
Only then can you belong to me

37:27.000 --> 37:35.996
Floating, falling, sweet intoxication!

37:36.398 --> 37:45.696
Touch me, trust me, savour each sensation!

37:46.097 --> 37:53.592
Let the dream begin, let your darker side give in

37:53.889 --> 38:02.642
To the power of the music that I write

38:02.677 --> 38:11.394
The power of the music of the night

38:36.001 --> 38:44.696
You alone can make my song take flight

38:45.399 --> 39:10.999
Help me make the music of the night

39:42.400 --> 39:44.102
Christine

41:14.807 --> 41:18.511
Like yellow parchment is his skin...

41:19.210 --> 41:25.207
A great black hole served as the nose that never grew...

41:27.112 --> 41:30.711
You must be always on your guard,

41:31.009 --> 41:35.610
or he will catch you with his magical lasso!

41:42.210 --> 41:45.375
Those who speak of what they know

41:45.410 --> 41:51.311
Find, too late, that prudent silence is wise.

41:51.910 --> 41:55.511
Joseph Buquet, hold your tongue

41:56.514 --> 42:01.012
Keep your hand at the level of your eyes

42:27.520 --> 42:32.310
I remember there was mist

42:32.610 --> 42:39.316
swirling mist upon a vast, glassy lake

42:39.816 --> 42:43.810
There were candles all around,

42:43.909 --> 42:47.920
and on the lake there was a boat,

42:48.519 --> 42:58.021
and in the boat there was a man

43:13.913 --> 43:19.269
Who was that shape in the shadows

43:19.306 --> 43:24.617
Whose is the face in the mask?

43:32.517 --> 43:34.081
Damn you!

43:34.115 --> 43:35.819
You little prying Pandora!

43:35.854 --> 43:38.186
You little demon

43:38.221 --> 43:40.118
Is this what you wanted to see?

43:40.154 --> 43:41.881
Curse you!

43:41.917 --> 43:44.716
You little lying Delilah!

43:44.752 --> 43:45.985
You little viper

43:46.020 --> 43:48.620
Now you cannot ever be free!

43:48.658 --> 43:51.884
Damn you...

43:51.919 --> 43:55.118
Curse you...

43:57.225 --> 44:01.219
Stranger than you dreamt it

44:01.519 --> 44:05.370
Can you even dare to look

44:05.404 --> 44:09.223
or bear to think of me:

44:09.523 --> 44:15.222
this loathsome gargoyle, who burns in hell,

44:15.257 --> 44:20.322
but secretly yearns for heaven,

44:20.355 --> 44:23.535
secretly...

44:23.569 --> 44:26.725
Christine...

44:29.923 --> 44:40.622
Fear can turn to love - you'll learn to see
to find the man behind the monster:

44:40.657 --> 44:52.321
this repulsive carcass, who seems a beast
but secretly dreams of beauty,

44:52.357 --> 44:57.727
secretly...

44:58.026 --> 45:00.226
Oh, Christine...

45:32.723 --> 45:34.790
Come we must return

45:34.825 --> 45:37.630
Those two fools Who run my
theatre Will be missing you.

46:37.835 --> 46:40.097
"Mystery after gala night,"

46:40.133 --> 46:42.528
It says, "Mystery of soprano's flight!"

46:42.563 --> 46:44.930
"Mystified all the papers say,

46:44.966 --> 46:46.352
we are mystified -

46:46.386 --> 46:47.701
we suspect foul play!"

46:47.737 --> 46:50.181
Bad news on soprano scene -

46:50.217 --> 46:53.069
First Carlotta, now Christine!

46:53.104 --> 46:57.724
Still, at least the seats get sold

46:57.758 --> 47:02.331
Gossip's worth its weight in gold...

47:02.728 --> 47:05.135
What a way to run a business!

47:05.432 --> 47:08.236
Spare me these unending trials!

47:08.272 --> 47:09.904
Half your cast disappears,

47:09.940 --> 47:11.530
but the crowd still cheers!

47:11.566 --> 47:12.797
Opera!

47:12.834 --> 47:16.234
To hell with Gluck and Handel
Have a scandal and you're sure to have a hint!

47:16.268 --> 47:17.002
Damnable!

47:17.036 --> 47:18.234
Will they all walk out?

47:18.271 --> 47:19.605
This is damnable!

47:19.638 --> 47:20.833
Andre, please don't shout...

47:20.868 --> 47:21.993
It's publicity!

47:22.028 --> 47:23.632
And the take is vast!

47:23.666 --> 47:24.797
Free publicity!

47:24.832 --> 47:26.505
But we have no cast...

47:26.539 --> 47:29.034
Andre, have you seen the queue?

47:29.438 --> 47:34.135
Oh, it seems you've got one too

47:35.238 --> 47:38.141
"Dear Andre, what a charming gala!

47:38.634 --> 47:41.296
Christine was in a word sublime!

47:41.331 --> 47:44.229
We were hardly bereft when Carlotta left -

47:44.533 --> 47:47.299
On that note the diva is a disaster

47:47.334 --> 47:49.543
must you cast her when she's seasons past her prime?!

47:49.577 --> 47:50.506
"Dear Firmin,

47:50.540 --> 47:51.637
just a brief reminder:

47:51.931 --> 47:54.235
my salary has not been paid.

47:54.638 --> 47:56.246
Send it care of the ghost,

47:56.280 --> 47:57.738
by return of post

47:57.772 --> 47:59.406
P.T.O.:

47:59.439 --> 48:00.698
No-one likes a debtor,

48:00.732 --> 48:02.829
so it's better if my orders are obeyed!"

48:03.728 --> 48:06.044
Who would have the gall to send this?

48:06.340 --> 48:08.537
Someone with a puerile brain!

48:08.570 --> 48:10.736
These are both signed "O.G."...

48:10.772 --> 48:12.330
Who the hell is he?

48:12.365 --> 48:13.804
Opera ghost!

48:13.839 --> 48:15.137
It's nothing short of shocking

48:15.171 --> 48:16.407
He's mucking our position!

48:16.441 --> 48:17.610
In addition he wants money

48:17.647 --> 48:20.235
What a funny aberration to expect a large retainer!

48:20.272 --> 48:22.334
Nothing plainer -he is clearly quite insane!

48:22.370 --> 48:23.096
Where is she?

48:23.132 --> 48:23.799
You mean Carlotta?

48:23.835 --> 48:25.542
I mean Miss Daae -where is she?

48:25.576 --> 48:26.543
Well, how should we know?

48:26.578 --> 48:27.309
I want an answer -

48:27.345 --> 48:28.739
I take it that you sent me this note

48:28.775 --> 48:29.937
What's all this nonsense?

48:29.973 --> 48:30.704
Of course not!

48:30.739 --> 48:31.402
Don't look at us!

48:31.437 --> 48:32.336
She's not with you, then?

48:32.371 --> 48:33.501
Of course not!

48:33.535 --> 48:34.438
We're in the dark...

48:34.472 --> 48:35.306
Monsieur, don't argue -

48:35.339 --> 48:36.807
Isn't this the letter you wrote?

48:36.841 --> 48:40.637
And what is it, that we're meant
to have wrote? Written!

48:42.836 --> 48:45.106
"Do not fear for Miss Daae.

48:45.142 --> 48:49.441
The Angel of Music has her under his wing.

48:49.475 --> 48:51.755
Make no attempt to see her again. "

48:51.791 --> 48:54.039
If you didn't write it, who did?

48:54.075 --> 48:55.205
Where is he?

48:55.241 --> 48:55.808
Ah, welcome back!

48:55.843 --> 48:56.846
Your precious patron -

48:56.880 --> 48:57.712
where is he?

48:57.748 --> 48:58.509
What is it now?

48:58.544 --> 48:59.507
I have your letter -

48:59.542 --> 49:00.740
a letter which I rather resent!

49:01.039 --> 49:02.137
And did you send it?

49:02.170 --> 49:03.153
Of course not!

49:03.189 --> 49:04.115
As if he would!

49:04.150 --> 49:05.041
You didn't send it?

49:05.076 --> 49:06.008
Of course not!

49:06.045 --> 49:06.910
What's going on?

49:06.944 --> 49:09.344
You dare to tell me, that this
is not the letter you sent?!

49:09.378 --> 49:11.139
And what is it that I'm meant to have sent?

49:14.441 --> 49:17.445
"Your days at the Opera Populaire are numbered.

49:18.146 --> 49:21.438
Christine Daae will be singing
on your behalf tonight.

49:21.474 --> 49:24.159
Be prepared for a great misfortune,

49:24.194 --> 49:26.846
should you attempt to take her place. "

49:30.842 --> 49:33.241
Far too many notes for my taste -

49:33.542 --> 49:36.011
and most of them about Christine!

49:36.044 --> 49:40.842
All we've heard since we came is Miss Daae's name...

49:41.141 --> 49:42.806
Miss Daae has returned

49:42.840 --> 49:45.545
I hope no worse for wear as far as we're concerned

49:45.580 --> 49:47.213
Where precisely is she now?

49:47.247 --> 49:50.940
I thought it best that she was
alone... She needed rest

49:51.242 --> 49:52.310
May I see her?

49:52.344 --> 49:54.245
No, monsieur, she will see no-one.

49:54.280 --> 49:56.111
Will she sing?

49:56.146 --> 49:57.748
Here, I have a note...

49:57.783 --> 49:58.846
Let me see it!

49:59.147 --> 50:00.044
Please!

50:04.345 --> 50:08.747
"Gentlemen, I have now sent you
several notes of the most amiable nature,

50:08.782 --> 50:12.244
detailing how my theatre is to be run.

50:13.043 --> 50:15.848
You have not followed my instructions.

50:16.148 --> 50:20.344
I shall give you one last chance..."

50:20.381 --> 50:24.546
Christine Daae has returned to you,

50:24.946 --> 50:30.947
and I am anxious her career should progress.

50:31.348 --> 50:36.315
In the new production of "Il Muto",

50:36.351 --> 50:42.446
you will therefore cast Carlotta as the Pageboy,

50:43.147 --> 50:48.850
and put Miss Daae in the role of Countess.

50:50.649 --> 50:57.950
The role which Miss Daae plays calls for charm and appeal.

50:57.987 --> 51:01.514
The role of the Pageboy is silent -

51:01.550 --> 51:07.253
which makes my casting, in a word, ideal.

51:09.552 --> 51:16.051
I shall watch the performance from my normal
seat in Box Five, which will be kept empty for me.

51:16.087 --> 51:22.748
Should these commands be ignored, a disaster
beyond your imagination will occur.

51:22.784 --> 51:28.151
"I remain, Gentlemen, Your obedient servant, O.G."

51:28.187 --> 51:28.816
Christine!

51:28.852 --> 51:29.153
It's all a ploy to help Christine!

51:29.187 --> 51:29.753
Whatever next...?

51:29.854 --> 51:31.949
It's all about a ploy to help Christine

51:31.985 --> 51:32.813
This is insane...

51:32.848 --> 51:35.052
I know who sent this:The Vicomte - her lover!

51:35.085 --> 51:36.318
Indeed? Can you believe this?

51:36.354 --> 51:37.753
Signora!
O traditori!This is a joke!

51:37.789 --> 51:39.154
This changes nothing!
O mentitori!

51:39.187 --> 51:40.419
Signora!

51:40.453 --> 51:41.551
You are our star!

51:41.586 --> 51:42.650
And always will be!

51:42.685 --> 51:43.815
Signora...

51:43.852 --> 51:44.616
The man is mad!

51:44.652 --> 51:45.618
We don't take orders!

51:45.653 --> 51:50.454
Miss Daae will be playing the Pageboy - the silent role...

51:50.488 --> 51:53.768
Carlotta will be playing the lead!

51:53.803 --> 51:57.054
It's useless trying to appease me!

51:57.255 --> 52:00.156
You're only saying this to please me!

52:00.191 --> 52:02.714
Signori, e vero?

52:02.752 --> 52:05.552
Non, non, non voglio udire!

52:05.588 --> 52:07.054
Lasciatemi morire!

52:07.091 --> 52:09.657
O padre mio!

52:09.691 --> 52:11.717
Dio!

52:11.753 --> 52:12.850
Who scorn his word, beware to those...
You have reviled me!

52:14.052 --> 52:16.657
The angel sees, the angel knows

52:16.691 --> 52:18.124
You have rebuked me!

52:18.162 --> 52:19.858
Signora, pardon us...?

52:19.892 --> 52:21.519
You have replaced me!

52:21.554 --> 52:22.952
Please, Signora, we beseech you...

52:23.252 --> 52:28.560
This hour shall see your darkest fears...

52:28.595 --> 52:30.474
Signora, sing for us!

52:30.507 --> 52:32.352
Don't be a martyr

52:33.253 --> 52:40.057
What new surprises lie in store?
Our star...!

52:44.855 --> 52:46.658
Would you please give this to Miss Daae?

52:47.360 --> 52:48.161
Miss Daae

52:51.255 --> 52:56.057
Your public needs you! We need you, too!

52:56.357 --> 53:00.358
Would you not rather have your precious little ingenue?

53:00.557 --> 53:02.918
Signora, no!

53:02.955 --> 53:08.464
The world wants you!

53:10.159 --> 53:16.424
Prima donna first lady of the stage!

53:16.459 --> 53:23.155
Your devotees are on their knees to implore you!

53:23.855 --> 53:30.360
Can you bow out when they're shouting your name?

53:30.658 --> 53:36.866
Think of how they all adore you!

53:37.467 --> 53:43.922
Prima donna, enchant us once again!

53:43.958 --> 53:50.760
Think of your muse... And of the queues round the theatre!

53:51.159 --> 53:57.268
Can you deny us the triumph in store?

53:57.302 --> 54:01.826
Sing, prima donna, once more!

54:01.860 --> 54:06.331
Christine spoke of an angel...

54:06.364 --> 54:11.325
Prima donna, your song shall live again!

54:11.359 --> 54:15.027
- Think of your public!
- You took a snub, but there's a public who needs you!

54:15.061 --> 54:20.763
- She has heard the voice of the angel of music...
- Those who hear your voice liken you to an angel!

54:20.798 --> 54:25.564
Think of their cry of undying support!

54:26.068 --> 54:27.268
We get our opera

54:27.569 --> 54:29.565
She gets her limelight!

54:31.760 --> 54:34.828
Leading ladies are a trial!

54:34.864 --> 54:41.127
Prima donna, your song shall never die!
You'll sing again, and to unending ovation!

54:41.162 --> 54:48.318
- Orders! Warnings!Lunatic demands!
- Tears... oaths... lunatic demands are regular occurrences!

54:48.353 --> 54:55.469
Think how you'll shine in that final encore!
Surely there'll be further scenes worse than this!

54:58.268 --> 55:01.228
Think, before these demands are rejected!

55:01.264 --> 55:04.969
Who'd believe a diva happy to relieve a chorus girl,

55:05.003 --> 55:06.870
who's gone and slept with the patron?

55:07.171 --> 55:09.866
Raoul and the soubrette,
entwined in love's duet!

55:09.901 --> 55:12.028
Although he may deny,

55:12.061 --> 55:13.730
he must have been with her!

55:13.766 --> 55:17.122
You'd never get away with all this in a play,

55:17.158 --> 55:20.509
but if it's loudly sung and in a foreign tongue

55:20.543 --> 55:23.868
it's just the sort of story audiences adore,

55:23.902 --> 55:27.240
in fact a perfect opera!

55:27.274 --> 55:33.631
Prima donna the world is at your feet!

55:33.667 --> 55:40.768
A nation waits, and how it hates to be cheated!

55:41.165 --> 55:48.572
Light up the stage with that age old rapport!

55:48.607 --> 56:07.174
Sing, prima donna, once more!

56:21.469 --> 56:22.368
Oh, go go

56:34.675 --> 56:39.171
They say that this youth has set my Lady's heart aflame!

56:39.207 --> 56:41.170
His Lordship, sure, would die of shock

56:41.205 --> 56:43.538
His Lordship is a laughing-stock!

56:43.572 --> 56:46.075
Should he suspect her, God protect her!

56:46.111 --> 56:48.240
Shame! Shame! Shame!

56:48.274 --> 56:54.874
This faithless lady's bound for HADES!

56:55.175 --> 56:56.877
Shame! Shame! Shame!

57:03.173 --> 57:06.477
Serafimo, your disguise is perfect.

57:06.512 --> 57:08.973
Who can this be?

57:09.274 --> 57:13.076
Gentle wife, admit your loving husband.

57:15.978 --> 57:18.277
That's exactly something the public loves

57:19.875 --> 57:29.374
My love, I am called to England on affairs of State,
and must leave you with your new maid.

57:32.376 --> 57:34.978
Though I'd happily take the maid with me.

57:36.578 --> 57:39.175
The old fool is leaving!

57:40.375 --> 57:42.242
That's the Countess de Cherbourg

57:42.277 --> 57:44.277
She's invited us to her salon, you know

57:44.780 --> 57:47.480
Nothing like that ever happened to us in the junk business

57:47.515 --> 57:48.677
Scrap metal

58:02.778 --> 58:05.879
Serafimo, away with this pretence!

58:06.479 --> 58:11.977
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my husband's absence!

58:16.181 --> 58:18.979
Poor fool, he makes me laugh!

58:19.014 --> 58:19.881
Haha,Haha...

58:24.581 --> 58:28.580
Time I tried to get a better better half!

58:28.980 --> 58:31.878
Poor fool, he doesn't know!

58:31.915 --> 58:37.846
Hoho, Hoho...

58:37.881 --> 58:41.879
If he knew the truth, he'd never, ever go!

58:42.478 --> 58:47.983
Did I not instruct that Box Five was to be kept empty?

58:56.683 --> 58:59.384
He's here, the Phantom of the Opera...

58:59.418 --> 59:00.250
It's him

59:00.284 --> 59:02.680
Your part is silent, little toad!

59:04.582 --> 59:09.785
A toad, madame? Perhaps it is you who are the toad...

59:29.288 --> 59:32.446
Serafimo, away with this pretence!

59:32.482 --> 59:37.288
You cannot speak, but kiss me in my...

59:49.190 --> 59:52.084
Poor fool, he makes me laugh

59:52.118 --> 59:53.382
Hahahahaha!?

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:11.660
Bring the curtain in. Please.

01:00:12.685 --> 01:00:23.887
Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize,
the performance will continue in ten minutes' time...

01:00:23.922 --> 01:00:32.586
...when the role of the Countess
will be played by Miss Daae.

01:00:33.984 --> 01:00:38.856
Until then, we will crave your
indulgence for a few moments

01:00:38.894 --> 01:00:44.087
Meanwhile, we'd like to give you the
ballet from Act Three of tonight's opera.

01:00:44.121 --> 01:00:44.953
what?

01:00:44.989 --> 01:00:48.496
Maestro, the ballet, bring forth, please

01:00:48.795 --> 01:00:49.691
The ballet

01:00:50.091 --> 01:00:51.587
The ballet, now, please

01:00:53.688 --> 01:00:55.091
One moment, thank you

01:00:55.124 --> 01:00:55.993
Thank you

01:01:01.987 --> 01:01:02.787
You're fired

01:02:55.402 --> 01:02:56.067
Are you alright?

01:02:56.102 --> 01:02:57.203
Raoul, we're not safe here

01:02:59.299 --> 01:03:03.299
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats.

01:03:03.698 --> 01:03:04.766
Do not panic.

01:03:04.801 --> 01:03:08.601
It's simple an accident... an accident

01:03:09.799 --> 01:03:11.646
Why have you brought me here?

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.499
We can't go back there!

01:03:13.534 --> 01:03:14.168
We must return!

01:03:14.202 --> 01:03:14.806
He'll kill you!

01:03:15.103 --> 01:03:16.855
His eyes will find us there!

01:03:16.891 --> 01:03:18.605
Christine, don't say that...

01:03:18.639 --> 01:03:19.914
Those eyes that burn!

01:03:19.949 --> 01:03:21.159
Don't even think it...

01:03:21.196 --> 01:03:24.102
And if he has to kill a thousand men -

01:03:24.136 --> 01:03:25.270
Forget this waking nightmare...

01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:27.505
The Phantom of the Opera will kill...
This phantom is a fable...

01:03:27.539 --> 01:03:29.370
Believe me...
... and kill again!

01:03:29.403 --> 01:03:31.201
There is no Phantom of the Opera...

01:03:31.236 --> 01:03:33.716
My God, who is this man...

01:03:33.752 --> 01:03:35.626
...who hunts to kill...?

01:03:35.663 --> 01:03:37.787
...this mask of death...?

01:03:37.825 --> 01:03:39.869
I can't escape from him...

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:41.099
Whose is this voice you hear...

01:03:41.133 --> 01:03:42.673
...I never will!

01:03:42.707 --> 01:03:44.856
...with every breath...?

01:03:44.892 --> 01:03:47.344
And in this labyrinth,

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.766
where night is blind

01:03:49.799 --> 01:03:55.311
the Phantom of the Opera is there/here:

01:03:55.345 --> 01:03:57.964
inside your/my mind...

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:01.796
There is no Phantom of the Opera...

01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:05.010
Raoul, I've been there -

01:04:05.404 --> 01:04:08.302
to his world of unending night...

01:04:08.599 --> 01:04:14.403
To a world with the daylight dissolves into darkness...

01:04:14.439 --> 01:04:15.907
darkness...

01:04:17.906 --> 01:04:21.802
Raoul, I've seen him!

01:04:22.102 --> 01:04:25.411
Can I ever forget that sight?

01:04:26.106 --> 01:04:29.766
Can I ever escape from that face?

01:04:29.802 --> 01:04:35.908
So distorted, deformed, it was hardly a face

01:04:35.942 --> 01:04:39.007
in that darkness...

01:04:39.305 --> 01:04:43.308
darkness...

01:04:46.207 --> 01:04:50.204
But his voice filled my spirit

01:04:50.241 --> 01:04:54.173
with a strange, sweet sound...

01:04:54.207 --> 01:05:04.659
In that night there was music in my mind...

01:05:04.693 --> 01:05:15.110
And through music my soul began to soar!

01:05:15.929 --> 01:05:21.796
And I heard as I'd never heard before...

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:29.132
What you heard was a dream and nothing more...

01:05:29.530 --> 01:05:32.931
Yet in his eyes

01:05:33.331 --> 01:05:40.032
all the sadness of the world...

01:05:40.332 --> 01:05:44.732
Those pleading eyes,

01:05:45.033 --> 01:05:57.333
that both threaten and adore...

01:05:57.734 --> 01:06:00.232
Christine...

01:06:00.535 --> 01:06:02.633
Christine...

01:06:03.131 --> 01:06:08.236
Christine...

01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:50.638
No more talk of darkness,

01:06:50.672 --> 01:06:54.135
Forget these wide-eyed fears.

01:06:54.435 --> 01:06:58.040
I'm here, nothing can harm you -

01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:02.336
my words will warm and calm you.

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:06.840
Let me be your freedom,

01:07:07.341 --> 01:07:10.838
let daylight dry your tears.

01:07:11.337 --> 01:07:14.835
I'm here with you, beside you,

01:07:15.137 --> 01:07:20.439
to guard you and to guide you...

01:07:20.739 --> 01:07:30.140
Say you love me every waking moment,

01:07:30.175 --> 01:07:38.060
turn my head with talk of summertime...

01:07:38.095 --> 01:07:45.943
Say you need me with you now and always...

01:07:48.162 --> 01:07:56.762
Promise me that all you say is true

01:07:57.259 --> 01:08:03.035
that's all I ask of you...

01:08:03.069 --> 01:08:09.769
Let me be your shelter, let me be your light.

01:08:09.804 --> 01:08:13.069
You're safe: No one will find you

01:08:14.066 --> 01:08:16.962
your fears are far behind you...

01:08:17.363 --> 01:08:20.738
All I want is freedom,

01:08:20.777 --> 01:08:25.527
a world with no more night... and you,

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:31.670
always beside me, to hold me and to hide me...

01:08:31.703 --> 01:08:35.825
Then say you'll share with me

01:08:35.861 --> 01:08:39.939
one love, one lifetime...

01:08:39.973 --> 01:08:48.631
let me lead you from your solitude...

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:56.969
Say you need me with you here, beside you...

01:08:57.368 --> 01:09:05.122
anywhere you go, let me go too

01:09:05.156 --> 01:09:10.035
Christine, that's all I ask of you...

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:17.964
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime...

01:09:17.997 --> 01:09:26.566
say the word and I will follow you...

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:30.563
Share each day with me,

01:09:30.663 --> 01:09:35.069
each night, each morning...

01:09:35.568 --> 01:09:44.122
Say you love me...
You know I do...

01:09:44.156 --> 01:09:52.654
Love me - that's all I ask of you...

01:10:17.167 --> 01:10:25.768
Anywhere you go let me go too...

01:10:26.265 --> 01:10:46.663
Love me - that's all I ask of you...

01:10:47.261 --> 01:10:49.321
I must go

01:10:49.355 --> 01:10:51.164
They'll wonder where I am

01:10:51.201 --> 01:10:52.364
Come with me, Raoul

01:10:52.862 --> 01:10:59.155
Christine, I love you

01:11:00.966 --> 01:11:03.759
Order your fine horses!

01:11:03.793 --> 01:11:06.477
Be with them at the door!

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:09.117
And soon you'll be beside me!

01:11:09.153 --> 01:11:14.864
You'll guard me, and you'll guide me...

01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:36.718
I gave you my music...

01:11:36.755 --> 01:11:42.158
made your song take wing...

01:11:42.192 --> 01:11:48.066
and now how you've repaid me:

01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:53.960
denied me and betrayed me...

01:11:55.956 --> 01:12:01.057
He was bound to love you

01:12:01.457 --> 01:12:06.351
when he heard you sing...

01:12:06.387 --> 01:12:08.264
Christine...

01:12:20.556 --> 01:12:30.256
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime...

01:12:30.862 --> 01:12:41.957
say the word and I will follow you...

01:12:42.258 --> 01:12:47.909
Share each day with me,

01:12:47.944 --> 01:12:53.551
each night, each morning...

01:12:53.950 --> 01:13:03.248
You will curse the day you did not do

01:13:03.583 --> 01:13:13.583
all that the Phantom asked of you...!

01:14:32.258 --> 01:14:34.950
"Bal Masque"

01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:37.203
M'sieur Andre?

01:14:37.237 --> 01:14:38.450
M'sieur Firmin?

01:14:39.347 --> 01:14:42.357
Dear Andre, what a splendid party!

01:14:42.390 --> 01:14:45.357
The prologue to a bright new year!

01:14:45.392 --> 01:14:46.919
Quite a night! I'm impressed!

01:14:46.956 --> 01:14:48.413
Well, one does one's best...

01:14:48.448 --> 01:14:50.915
Here's to us! The toast for the city

01:14:50.949 --> 01:14:53.452
What a pity that 'Phantom' can't be here.

01:14:57.449 --> 01:14:59.044
Masquerade!

01:14:59.443 --> 01:15:01.654
Paper faces on parade...

01:15:01.688 --> 01:15:03.015
Masquerade!

01:15:03.051 --> 01:15:06.549
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!

01:15:07.648 --> 01:15:10.012
Masquerade!

01:15:10.048 --> 01:15:12.052
Every face a different shade..

01:15:12.087 --> 01:15:13.316
Masquerade!

01:15:13.352 --> 01:15:14.519
Look around -

01:15:14.555 --> 01:15:16.698
there's another mask behind you!

01:15:16.733 --> 01:15:18.535
Flash of mauve.. Splash of puce...

01:15:18.569 --> 01:15:20.321
Fool and king... Ghoul and goose...

01:15:20.357 --> 01:15:21.800
Green and black... Queen and priest...

01:15:21.837 --> 01:15:23.248
Trace and rouge... Face of beast...

01:15:23.283 --> 01:15:25.017
Faces...

01:15:25.052 --> 01:15:27.744
Take your turn, take a ride on the merry-go-round...

01:15:27.780 --> 01:15:29.516
in an inhuman race...

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:30.852
Eye of gold... Thigh of blue...

01:15:30.888 --> 01:15:32.215
True is false... Who is who...?

01:15:32.251 --> 01:15:33.655
Crul of lip... Swirl of gown...

01:15:33.690 --> 01:15:35.050
Ace of hearts... Face of clown...

01:15:35.085 --> 01:15:36.711
Faces...

01:15:36.746 --> 01:15:39.149
Drink it in, drink it up, till you've drowned

01:15:39.186 --> 01:15:39.869
in the light...

01:15:39.905 --> 01:15:40.517
in the sound...

01:15:40.552 --> 01:15:42.046
But who can name the face...

01:15:42.082 --> 01:15:44.315
Masquerade!

01:15:44.351 --> 01:15:46.843
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...

01:15:46.877 --> 01:15:47.804
Masquerade!

01:15:47.839 --> 01:15:48.813
Take your fill -

01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:51.947
let the spectacle astound you!

01:15:52.450 --> 01:15:54.711
Masquerade!

01:15:54.749 --> 01:15:56.939
Burning glances, turning heads...

01:15:56.975 --> 01:15:58.417
Masquerade!

01:15:58.452 --> 01:16:02.151
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!

01:16:03.351 --> 01:16:04.147
Masquerade!

01:16:05.346 --> 01:16:07.542
Seething shadows, breathing lies...

01:16:07.583 --> 01:16:09.017
Masquerade!

01:16:09.051 --> 01:16:12.850
You can fool any friend who ever knew you!

01:16:13.648 --> 01:16:16.106
Masquerade!

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:18.352
Leering satyrs, peering eyes...

01:16:18.386 --> 01:16:19.615
Masquerade!

01:16:19.650 --> 01:16:20.810
Run and hide -

01:16:20.845 --> 01:16:23.946
but a face will still pursue you!

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:24.710
What a night!

01:16:24.744 --> 01:16:25.392
What a crowd!

01:16:25.427 --> 01:16:26.082
Makes you glad!

01:16:26.117 --> 01:16:26.708
Makes you proud!

01:16:26.743 --> 01:16:28.216
All the creme de la creme!

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:30.246
Watching us watching them!
And all our fears are in the past!

01:16:30.279 --> 01:16:31.119
Six months...

01:16:31.154 --> 01:16:31.851
Of relief!

01:16:31.885 --> 01:16:32.514
Of delight!

01:16:32.549 --> 01:16:34.805
Of Elysian peace!

01:16:34.841 --> 01:16:36.142
And we can breathe at last!
No more notes!

01:16:36.177 --> 01:16:36.917
No more ghosts!

01:16:36.953 --> 01:16:37.615
Here's a health!

01:16:37.652 --> 01:16:39.845
Here's a toast: to a prosperous year!

01:16:39.879 --> 01:16:40.449
To the new chandelier!

01:16:40.483 --> 01:16:41.215
to the hear

01:16:41.251 --> 01:16:43.443
And may its splendour never
fade! Six months! What a joy!

01:16:43.479 --> 01:16:44.208
What a change!

01:16:44.242 --> 01:16:46.145
What a blessed release!

01:16:46.181 --> 01:16:48.014
And what a masquerade!

01:16:48.048 --> 01:16:50.750
Think of it! A secret engagement!

01:16:50.784 --> 01:16:53.043
Look - your future bride!

01:16:53.841 --> 01:16:55.190
Just think of it!

01:16:55.224 --> 01:16:56.642
But why is it secret?

01:16:56.677 --> 01:16:58.047
What have we to hide?

01:16:58.081 --> 01:16:59.243
You promised me

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:01.446
No, Raoul, please don't do this

01:17:01.482 --> 01:17:02.245
Well, let them see

01:17:02.642 --> 01:17:04.537
It's an engagement, not a crime!

01:17:05.344 --> 01:17:09.349
Christine, What are you afraid of?

01:17:09.448 --> 01:17:12.508
Let's not argue...
Let's not argue...

01:17:12.542 --> 01:17:14.945
Please pretend...
I can only hope I'll...

01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:16.214
You will...

01:17:16.248 --> 01:17:20.050
...understand in time...

01:18:30.337 --> 01:18:33.544
Masquerade!

01:18:33.944 --> 01:18:37.741
Paper faces on parade!

01:18:37.776 --> 01:18:39.003
Masquerade!

01:18:39.037 --> 01:18:42.644
Hide your face, so the world will never find you!

01:18:43.841 --> 01:18:45.810
Masquerade!

01:18:45.845 --> 01:18:48.339
Every face a different shade!

01:18:48.373 --> 01:18:49.453
Masquerade!

01:18:49.488 --> 01:18:50.501
Look around -

01:18:50.535 --> 01:18:53.840
There's another mask behind you!

01:18:54.742 --> 01:18:56.906
Masquerade!

01:18:56.941 --> 01:18:59.534
Burning glances turning heads...

01:18:59.569 --> 01:19:00.908
Masquerade!

01:19:00.942 --> 01:19:04.945
Stop and stare at the sea of smiles around you!

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:08.499
Masquerade!

01:19:08.534 --> 01:19:10.744
Grinning yellows, spinning reds...

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:12.208
Masquerade!

01:19:12.243 --> 01:19:13.205
Take your fill -

01:19:13.239 --> 01:19:17.237
let the spectacle astound you!

01:19:37.036 --> 01:19:41.041
Why so silent, good messieurs?

01:19:41.439 --> 01:19:46.834
Did you think that I had left you for good?

01:19:47.133 --> 01:19:50.141
Have you missed me, good messieurs?

01:19:50.441 --> 01:19:53.741
I have written you an opera!

01:19:56.135 --> 01:19:59.642
Here I bring the finished score

01:19:59.675 --> 01:20:02.641
"Don Juan Triumphant"!

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:09.905
Fondest greetings to you all!

01:20:09.939 --> 01:20:15.634
A few instructions just before rehearsal starts:

01:20:15.668 --> 01:20:21.339
Carlotta must be taught to act, not her normal trick

01:20:21.374 --> 01:20:24.732
of strutting round the stage.

01:20:25.829 --> 01:20:28.903
Our Don Juan must lose some weight -

01:20:28.938 --> 01:20:34.134
it's not healthy in a man of Piangi's age.

01:20:35.131 --> 01:20:46.541
And my managers must learn that their place is in an office, not the arts.

01:20:47.344 --> 01:20:54.033
As for our star, Miss Christine Daae...

01:20:56.042 --> 01:21:03.737
No doubt she'll do her best - it's true her voice is good.

01:21:03.771 --> 01:21:08.607
She knows, though, should she wish to excel

01:21:08.641 --> 01:21:18.440
she has much still to learn, if pride will let her return to me

01:21:18.729 --> 01:21:24.727
Her teacher, her teacher...

01:21:58.237 --> 01:21:59.834
Your chains are still mine

01:21:59.871 --> 01:22:01.625
You belong to me

01:22:34.832 --> 01:22:35.997
Madame Giry. Madame Giry...

01:22:36.032 --> 01:22:37.932
Please, Monsieur, I know no more than anyone else.

01:22:37.968 --> 01:22:38.329
That's not true.

01:22:39.128 --> 01:22:43.533
Monsieur, don't ask, there have been too many accidents

01:22:43.567 --> 01:22:47.931
Accidents? Please, Madame Giry, for all our sakes...

01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:52.533
Very well.

01:23:14.429 --> 01:23:16.329
It was years ago.

01:23:17.425 --> 01:23:20.433
There was a travelling fair in the city.

01:23:21.233 --> 01:23:22.929
Gypsies

01:23:24.331 --> 01:23:29.328
I was very young, studying to be a ballerina

01:23:31.032 --> 01:23:32.527
One of many

01:23:33.427 --> 01:23:36.525
Living in the dormitory of the opera house

01:23:51.328 --> 01:23:56.523
Come, come, come inside

01:23:57.224 --> 01:24:01.227
Come and see the devil's child

01:24:33.925 --> 01:24:37.030
? the devil's child

01:24:45.220 --> 01:24:47.232
Devil's child

01:25:24.121 --> 01:25:26.426
Murder, murder

01:25:26.463 --> 01:25:28.723
Which way?

01:25:31.322 --> 01:25:33.721
...way

01:26:02.219 --> 01:26:05.424
I have hidden him from the world and its cruelties

01:26:07.221 --> 01:26:10.021
He has known nothing else of life since then

01:26:10.056 --> 01:26:12.020
Except this opera house

01:26:13.224 --> 01:26:19.121
It was his playground and now his artistic domain

01:26:19.157 --> 01:26:25.022
He's a genius, he's an architect and designer

01:26:25.057 --> 01:26:26.821
He's a composer and a magician

01:26:27.424 --> 01:26:28.886
A genius, monsieur

01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.224
But clearly, Madame Giry, genius has turned to madness

01:27:47.413 --> 01:27:47.981
Monsieur

01:27:48.015 --> 01:27:49.121
Ou vas tu, mademoiselle?

01:27:49.157 --> 01:27:50.022
The cemetery

01:28:29.417 --> 01:28:31.415
To my father's grave, please

01:28:48.019 --> 01:28:49.116
Where have they gone?

01:28:49.151 --> 01:28:50.114
Oh, the cemetery

01:29:05.314 --> 01:29:09.311
In sleep he sang to me

01:29:09.413 --> 01:29:13.877
In dreams he came

01:29:13.911 --> 01:29:22.908
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name

01:30:00.808 --> 01:30:03.614
Little Lotte thought of everything and nothing

01:30:06.013 --> 01:30:10.707
Her Father promised her that he would send her the Angel of Music.

01:30:13.014 --> 01:30:15.113
Her father promised her...

01:30:18.812 --> 01:30:20.408
Her father promised her

01:30:29.012 --> 01:30:35.410
You were once my one companion...

01:30:35.708 --> 01:30:41.813
you were all that mattered...

01:30:42.915 --> 01:30:50.609
You were once a friend and father -

01:30:51.512 --> 01:30:58.408
then my world was shattered...

01:30:58.806 --> 01:31:05.107
Wishing you were somehow here again...

01:31:05.609 --> 01:31:11.414
wishing you were somehow near...

01:31:11.713 --> 01:31:17.408
Sometimes it seemed if I just dreamed,

01:31:17.707 --> 01:31:24.106
somehow you would be here...

01:31:24.808 --> 01:31:31.213
Wishing I could hear your voice again...

01:31:31.246 --> 01:31:36.906
knowing that I never would...

01:31:37.305 --> 01:31:43.005
Dreaming of you won't help me to do,

01:31:43.705 --> 01:31:49.711
all that you dreamed I could!

01:31:50.611 --> 01:31:56.504
Passing bells and sculpted angels,

01:31:56.538 --> 01:32:02.304
cold and monumental.

01:32:02.604 --> 01:32:09.710
Seem, for you, the wrong companions,

01:32:10.311 --> 01:32:17.607
you were warm and gentle.

01:32:30.506 --> 01:32:36.705
Too many years fighting back tears,

01:32:36.739 --> 01:32:43.006
why can't the past just die!

01:32:43.305 --> 01:32:50.503
Wishing you were somehow here again,

01:32:50.803 --> 01:32:57.708
knowing we must say goodbye!

01:32:58.009 --> 01:33:03.702
Try to forgive, teach me to live!

01:33:03.737 --> 01:33:09.467
Give me the strength to try!

01:33:09.502 --> 01:33:19.502
No more memories, no more silent tears!

01:33:19.535 --> 01:33:29.501
No more gazing across the wasted years!

01:33:29.536 --> 01:33:39.302
Help me say goodbye...

01:33:41.001 --> 01:33:54.406
help me say goodbye!

01:34:09.002 --> 01:34:11.699
Wandering child,

01:34:11.735 --> 01:34:15.770
So lost, so helpless

01:34:15.804 --> 01:34:19.800
Yearning for my guidance

01:34:20.697 --> 01:34:23.304
Angel or father?

01:34:23.340 --> 01:34:25.901
Friend or phantom?

01:34:26.198 --> 01:34:29.067
Who is it there, staring?

01:34:29.100 --> 01:34:32.002
Have you forgotten your Angel?

01:34:32.036 --> 01:34:33.471
Angel, oh, speak

01:34:33.505 --> 01:34:37.752
What endless longings

01:34:37.785 --> 01:34:41.967
Echo in this whisper

01:34:42.003 --> 01:34:46.498
Too long you've wandered in winter

01:34:46.533 --> 01:34:51.265
Far from my fathering gaze

01:34:51.301 --> 01:34:54.997
Wildly my mind beats against you

01:34:55.032 --> 01:34:56.064
You resist

01:34:56.099 --> 01:35:02.505
Yet your/the soul obeys...

01:35:02.539 --> 01:35:04.863
Angel of Music!

01:35:04.896 --> 01:35:09.449
You denied me/I denied you

01:35:09.483 --> 01:35:13.999
Turning from true beauty

01:35:14.032 --> 01:35:16.264
Angel of Music!

01:35:16.298 --> 01:35:19.666
Do not shun me/My protector

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:24.297
Come to me/your strange Angel...

01:35:24.330 --> 01:35:29.364
I am your Angel of Music...

01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:34.596
Come to me; Angel of Music
No, Christine, wait!

01:35:34.897 --> 01:35:35.998
Wait!

01:35:37.196 --> 01:35:37.860
Raoul!

01:35:37.897 --> 01:35:38.563
Whatever you believe,

01:35:38.596 --> 01:35:40.702
this man - this thing - is not your father!

01:36:53.792 --> 01:36:56.198
No, Raoul, no

01:36:57.398 --> 01:36:59.393
Not like this

01:37:23.589 --> 01:37:27.904
Now, let it be war upon you both!

01:37:32.897 --> 01:37:35.559
We have all been blind

01:37:35.596 --> 01:37:38.604
And yet the answer is staring us in the face

01:37:39.491 --> 01:37:41.746
This could be the chance

01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:43.989
To ensnare our clever friend

01:37:44.396 --> 01:37:45.400
We're listening...

01:37:45.442 --> 01:37:45.989
Go on.

01:37:46.506 --> 01:37:49.185
We shall play his game

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:52.691
Perform his work, but remember we hold the ace

01:37:52.725 --> 01:37:55.215
For if Miss Daae sings

01:37:55.254 --> 01:37:57.653
He is certain to attend

01:37:57.688 --> 01:37:59.301
We are certain the doors are barred

01:37:59.334 --> 01:38:00.885
We are certain the police are there

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:02.087
We are certain they're armed

01:38:02.591 --> 01:38:04.399
The curtain falls

01:38:04.433 --> 01:38:06.201
His reign will end!

01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:36.190
Raoul, I'm frightened...

01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:40.191
Don't make me do this

01:38:42.196 --> 01:38:44.889
Raoul, it scares me,

01:38:46.787 --> 01:38:49.288
Don't put me through this ordeal by fire.

01:38:51.391 --> 01:38:54.688
He'll take me, I know

01:38:56.587 --> 01:38:58.887
We'll be parted forever...

01:38:59.388 --> 01:39:01.292
He won't let me go.

01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:08.287
What I once used to dream, I now dread.

01:39:10.390 --> 01:39:12.392
If he finds me, it won't ever end.

01:39:12.992 --> 01:39:16.239
And he'll always be there,

01:39:16.272 --> 01:39:19.489
singing songs in my head...

01:39:19.789 --> 01:39:22.956
He'll always be there,

01:39:22.989 --> 01:39:28.688
singing songs in my head...

01:39:32.787 --> 01:39:37.650
You said yourself,

01:39:37.685 --> 01:39:43.986
He was nothing but a man...

01:39:46.386 --> 01:39:51.454
Yet while he lives,

01:39:51.487 --> 01:40:02.684
He will haunt us 'til we're dead.

01:40:06.385 --> 01:40:09.255
Twisted every way

01:40:09.292 --> 01:40:12.086
What answer can I give?

01:40:12.484 --> 01:40:14.987
Am I to risk my life

01:40:15.285 --> 01:40:17.788
To win the chance to live?

01:40:18.187 --> 01:40:21.450
Can I betray the man

01:40:21.485 --> 01:40:24.586
Who once inspired my voice?

01:40:24.885 --> 01:40:27.288
Do I become his prey?

01:40:27.688 --> 01:40:30.252
Do I have any choice?

01:40:30.287 --> 01:40:32.734
He kills without a thought

01:40:32.767 --> 01:40:35.378
He murders all that's good

01:40:35.411 --> 01:40:37.952
I know I can't refuse...

01:40:37.987 --> 01:40:40.484
And yet, I wish I could

01:40:40.518 --> 01:40:42.950
Oh God, if I agree

01:40:42.984 --> 01:40:47.488
What horrors wait for me

01:40:47.524 --> 01:40:51.983
In this, the Phantom's opera

01:40:52.783 --> 01:40:56.550
Christine, Christine

01:40:56.587 --> 01:41:00.832
Don't think that I don't care

01:41:00.865 --> 01:41:05.085
But every hope, and every prayer

01:41:05.119 --> 01:41:10.280
rests on you now

01:41:28.283 --> 01:41:31.346
Seal my fate tonight

01:41:31.382 --> 01:41:36.785
I hate to have to cut the fun short

01:41:37.184 --> 01:41:40.581
But the joke's wearing thin

01:41:40.614 --> 01:41:44.702
Let the audience in

01:41:44.736 --> 01:41:48.780
Let my opera begin!

01:41:50.983 --> 01:41:54.986
"Don Juan"

01:42:14.387 --> 01:42:18.078
Here the sire may serve the dam,

01:42:18.116 --> 01:42:21.781
here the master takes his meat!

01:42:21.982 --> 01:42:25.232
Here the sacrificial lamb

01:42:25.268 --> 01:42:28.479
utters one despairing bleat!

01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:32.432
Poor young maiden! For the thrill

01:42:32.468 --> 01:42:35.472
on your tongue of stolen sweets

01:42:35.507 --> 01:42:38.892
you will have to pay the bill -

01:42:38.927 --> 01:42:42.283
tangled in the winding sheets!

01:42:42.582 --> 01:42:44.730
Serve the meal and serve the maid!

01:42:44.765 --> 01:42:47.118
Serve the meal and serve the maid

01:42:47.157 --> 01:42:49.518
Serve the master so that, when

01:42:49.551 --> 01:42:51.882
tables, plans and maids are laid,

01:42:52.384 --> 01:43:06.377
Don Juan triumphs once again!

01:43:18.381 --> 01:43:21.082
Passarino, faithful friend,

01:43:21.118 --> 01:43:23.742
once again recite the plan.

01:43:23.777 --> 01:43:26.376
Your young guest believes I'm you -

01:43:26.411 --> 01:43:29.180
I, the master, you, the man

01:43:29.883 --> 01:43:32.081
When you met you wore my cloak,

01:43:32.115 --> 01:43:33.844
she cannot see your face.

01:43:33.877 --> 01:43:36.127
She believes she dines with me,

01:43:36.164 --> 01:43:38.270
in her master's borrowed place!

01:43:38.305 --> 01:43:40.195
Furtively, we'll scoff and quaff,

01:43:40.229 --> 01:43:42.080
stealing what, in truth, is mine.

01:43:42.116 --> 01:43:44.039
When it's late and modesty

01:43:44.076 --> 01:43:45.975
starts to mellow, with the wine...

01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:47.944
You come home! I use your voice -

01:43:47.978 --> 01:43:49.881
slam the door like crack of doom!

01:43:49.915 --> 01:43:51.745
I shall say: "come - hide with me!

01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:54.075
Where, oh, where? Of course - my room!"

01:43:54.573 --> 01:43:56.526
Poor thing hasn't got a chance!

01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:58.477
Here's my hat, my cloak and sword.

01:43:58.514 --> 01:43:59.479
Conquest is assured,

01:44:00.081 --> 01:44:02.973
if I do not forget myself and laugh...

01:44:11.078 --> 01:44:12.439
No thoughts

01:44:12.474 --> 01:44:15.425
within her head,

01:44:15.461 --> 01:44:18.379
but thoughts of joy!

01:44:18.414 --> 01:44:19.545
No dreams

01:44:19.578 --> 01:44:24.375
within her heart

01:44:24.409 --> 01:44:29.179
but dreams of love!

01:44:34.174 --> 01:44:35.775
Master?

01:44:36.276 --> 01:44:40.938
Passarino - go away!

01:44:40.973 --> 01:44:50.772
For the trap is set and waits for its prey...

01:44:53.273 --> 01:44:56.878
You have come here

01:44:57.379 --> 01:45:01.771
in pursuit of your deepest urge,

01:45:02.071 --> 01:45:04.539
in pursuit of that wish,

01:45:04.574 --> 01:45:08.576
which till now has been silent,

01:45:08.975 --> 01:45:11.973
silent...

01:45:12.874 --> 01:45:16.679
I have brought you,

01:45:17.179 --> 01:45:21.170
that our passions may fuse and merge -

01:45:21.572 --> 01:45:22.638
in your mind

01:45:22.673 --> 01:45:25.674
you've already succumbed to me

01:45:25.710 --> 01:45:27.075
dropped all defences

01:45:27.378 --> 01:45:31.173
completely succumbed to me -

01:45:31.469 --> 01:45:33.773
now you are here with me:

01:45:34.274 --> 01:45:36.675
no second thoughts,

01:45:37.273 --> 01:45:42.671
you've decided,

01:45:43.775 --> 01:45:48.272
decided...

01:45:50.869 --> 01:45:55.775
Past the point of no return -

01:45:56.772 --> 01:45:59.832
no backward glances:

01:45:59.867 --> 01:46:07.168
Our games of make-believe are at an end

01:46:09.468 --> 01:46:13.973
Past all thought of "if" or "when" -

01:46:15.472 --> 01:46:18.118
no use resisting:

01:46:18.154 --> 01:46:20.739
abandon thought,

01:46:20.772 --> 01:46:26.334
and let the dream descend...

01:46:26.369 --> 01:46:30.370
What raging fire shall flood the soul

01:46:30.772 --> 01:46:34.773
What rich desire unlocks its door

01:46:34.970 --> 01:46:42.675
What sweet seduction lies before us?

01:46:43.374 --> 01:46:47.366
Past the point of no return

01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:51.738
The final threshold

01:46:51.772 --> 01:46:55.568
What warm unspoken secrets

01:46:55.866 --> 01:46:58.570
Will we learn

01:46:59.271 --> 01:47:11.672
beyond the point of no return?

01:47:11.707 --> 01:47:15.530
You have brought me

01:47:15.566 --> 01:47:19.570
To that moment when words run dry

01:47:19.769 --> 01:47:23.668
To that moment when speech disappears

01:47:23.702 --> 01:47:25.863
Into silence

01:47:26.565 --> 01:47:29.171
Silence.

01:47:29.570 --> 01:47:33.368
I have come here,

01:47:33.668 --> 01:47:37.668
Hardly knowing the reason why

01:47:38.169 --> 01:47:42.171
In my mind I've already imagined

01:47:42.204 --> 01:47:44.732
Our bodies entwining

01:47:44.765 --> 01:47:47.469
Defenseless and silent,

01:47:47.503 --> 01:47:50.172
Now I am here with you

01:47:50.471 --> 01:47:52.965
No second thoughts

01:47:53.265 --> 01:48:00.370
I've decided

01:48:00.968 --> 01:48:06.568
Decided.

01:48:07.869 --> 01:48:12.861
Past the point of no return

01:48:13.763 --> 01:48:16.431
No going back now

01:48:16.466 --> 01:48:23.764
Our passion-play has now at last begun.

01:48:25.766 --> 01:48:30.467
Past all thought of right or wrong

01:48:30.866 --> 01:48:34.130
One final question

01:48:34.163 --> 01:48:41.761
How long should we two wait before we're one?

01:48:41.795 --> 01:48:45.834
When will the blood begin to race

01:48:45.869 --> 01:48:49.831
The sleeping bud burst into bloom

01:48:49.865 --> 01:48:59.067
When will the flames at last consume us?

01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:04.967
Past the point of no return

01:49:05.565 --> 01:49:08.568
The final threshold

01:49:08.602 --> 01:49:11.562
The bridge is crossed

01:49:11.961 --> 01:49:18.131
So stand and watch it burn

01:49:18.168 --> 01:49:33.263
We've passed the point of no return.

01:49:49.357 --> 01:49:54.665
Say you'll share with me

01:49:54.699 --> 01:49:59.959
One love, one lifetime

01:50:00.359 --> 01:50:10.860
Lead me, save me from my solitude

01:50:10.894 --> 01:50:14.564
Say you'll want me

01:50:14.598 --> 01:50:17.325
With you here

01:50:17.361 --> 01:50:20.060
Beside you

01:50:21.561 --> 01:50:25.863
Anywhere you go

01:50:25.896 --> 01:50:30.124
Let me go too

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:39.158
Christine that's all I ask of...

01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:24.456
Go!

01:51:39.860 --> 01:51:41.661
Oh,?

01:51:45.655 --> 01:51:47.660
You left before me

01:51:48.359 --> 01:51:49.260
Oh my God

01:51:49.660 --> 01:51:51.161
We'll run, Andre, run

01:52:03.751 --> 01:52:05.053
Where did he take her?

01:52:05.354 --> 01:52:06.456
Come with me, monsieur

01:52:06.494 --> 01:52:07.524
I will take you to him

01:52:07.557 --> 01:52:10.858
But remember, keep your hand at the level of your eyes

01:52:10.894 --> 01:52:11.920
I'll go with you

01:52:11.956 --> 01:52:13.752
No, Meg, you must stay here

01:52:13.787 --> 01:52:15.254
Come with me, monsieur

01:52:15.556 --> 01:52:16.460
No!

01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:23.951
Down once more to the dungeons of my black despair

01:52:23.987 --> 01:52:29.459
Down we plunge to the prison of my mind

01:52:29.494 --> 01:52:33.854
Down that path into darkness,

01:52:33.888 --> 01:52:37.357
deep as hell

01:52:41.053 --> 01:52:42.214
Why, you ask,

01:52:42.250 --> 01:52:43.013
was I bound and chained

01:52:43.050 --> 01:52:44.954
in this cold and dismal place?

01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:46.921
Not for any mortal sin

01:52:46.955 --> 01:52:48.858
but the wickedness of my abhorrent face

01:52:51.749 --> 01:52:52.650
Track down this murderer

01:52:52.685 --> 01:52:53.917
He must be found

01:52:53.955 --> 01:52:54.958
Track down this murderer

01:52:54.994 --> 01:52:56.421
He must be found

01:52:56.456 --> 01:52:58.457
Hounded out by everyone

01:52:58.492 --> 01:53:00.518
Met with hatred everywhere

01:53:00.553 --> 01:53:02.654
No kind words from anyone

01:53:02.691 --> 01:53:04.757
No compassion anywhere

01:53:04.792 --> 01:53:06.054
Christine

01:53:07.856 --> 01:53:11.849
Why, why...?

01:53:15.854 --> 01:53:24.058
Your hand at the level of your eyes

01:53:24.092 --> 01:53:25.454
This is as far as I dare go

01:53:27.354 --> 01:53:28.549
Thank you

01:55:09.648 --> 01:55:14.946
Have you gorged yourself at last in your lust for blood?

01:55:18.049 --> 01:55:23.449
Am I now to be prey to your lust for flesh?

01:55:25.842 --> 01:55:30.550
That fate, which condemns me to wallow in blood

01:55:31.050 --> 01:55:36.443
Has also denied me the joys of the flesh...

01:55:37.150 --> 01:55:43.049
This face, the infection which poisons our love...

01:55:44.045 --> 01:55:52.846
This face, which earned a mother's fear and loathing

01:55:52.881 --> 01:56:01.846
A mask, my first unfeeling scrap of clothing

01:56:01.883 --> 01:56:04.308
Pity comes too late

01:56:04.342 --> 01:56:07.348
Turn around and face your fate

01:56:07.850 --> 01:56:17.149
An eternity of this before your eyes

01:56:28.348 --> 01:56:40.246
This haunted face holds no horror for me now

01:56:40.844 --> 01:56:54.846
It's in your soul that the true distortion lies

01:56:56.547 --> 01:57:00.542
Wait! I think, my dear, we have a guest

01:57:01.042 --> 01:57:01.939
Sir!
- Raoul!

01:57:02.339 --> 01:57:06.147
This is indeed an unparalleled delight

01:57:06.546 --> 01:57:10.441
I had rather hoped that you would come

01:57:11.739 --> 01:57:14.512
And now my wish comes true

01:57:14.545 --> 01:57:16.347
You have truly made my night!
Let me go!

01:57:16.381 --> 01:57:17.813
Free her

01:57:17.848 --> 01:57:19.741
Do what you like, only free her

01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:21.038
Have you no pity?

01:57:21.338 --> 01:57:23.244
Your lover makes a passionate plea

01:57:23.277 --> 01:57:24.045
Please, Raoul, it's useless

01:57:24.082 --> 01:57:25.145
I love her

01:57:25.547 --> 01:57:26.645
Does that mean nothing?

01:57:26.681 --> 01:57:28.110
I love her

01:57:28.143 --> 01:57:29.208
Show some compassion

01:57:29.241 --> 01:57:31.638
The world showed no compassion to me!

01:57:31.675 --> 01:57:33.513
Christine...

01:57:33.549 --> 01:57:35.310
Let me see her

01:57:35.345 --> 01:57:37.742
Be my guest, sir...

01:57:40.436 --> 01:57:44.745
Monsieur, I bid you welcome

01:57:45.045 --> 01:57:50.036
Did you think that I would harm her?

01:57:50.337 --> 01:57:58.639
Why would I make her pay for the sins which are yours?

01:58:00.239 --> 01:58:02.607
Order your fine horses now

01:58:02.645 --> 01:58:05.110
Raise up your hand to the level of your eyes

01:58:05.145 --> 01:58:09.437
Nothing can save you now, except perhaps Christine

01:58:10.941 --> 01:58:13.309
Start a new life with me

01:58:13.344 --> 01:58:16.007
Buy his freedom with your love!

01:58:16.042 --> 01:58:19.235
Refuse me, and you send your lover to his death!

01:58:19.271 --> 01:58:21.207
This is the choice,

01:58:21.242 --> 01:58:27.737
This is the point of no return!

01:58:30.339 --> 01:58:36.738
The tears I might have shed for your dark fate,

01:58:36.773 --> 01:58:44.143
Grow cold and turn to tears of hate

01:58:46.437 --> 01:58:49.740
Christine, forgive me, please forgive me

01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:53.992
I did it all for you, and all for nothing...

01:58:54.026 --> 01:58:57.100
Farewell, my fallen idol and false friend

01:58:57.135 --> 01:59:00.944
We had such hopes, and now those hopes are shattered
Too late for turning back, Too late for prayers and useless pity

01:59:00.978 --> 01:59:08.738
Say you love him, and my life is over!
All hope of cries for help, No point in fighting

01:59:09.039 --> 01:59:16.334
For either way you choose, You cannot win
Either way you choose, he has to win

01:59:16.368 --> 01:59:20.060
So do you end your days with me

01:59:20.094 --> 01:59:23.737
Or do you send him to his grave?

01:59:23.939 --> 01:59:31.340
Why make her lie to you to save me?

01:59:31.741 --> 01:59:36.333
Angel of Music...
Past the point of no return...

01:59:36.370 --> 01:59:39.204
Christine say no!
Who deserved this?

01:59:39.238 --> 01:59:42.340
Don't throw your life away for my sake!
The final threshold...

01:59:42.639 --> 01:59:44.832
His life is now the prize which you must earn!
Why do you curse mercy?

01:59:46.032 --> 01:59:49.039
I fought so hard to free you...

01:59:49.841 --> 02:00:03.134
Angel of Music... you deceived me
You've passed the point of no return!

02:00:05.032 --> 02:00:07.139
I gave you my mind blindly

02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:10.839
You try my patience,

02:00:11.138 --> 02:00:12.732
Make your choice!

02:00:25.735 --> 02:00:31.434
Pitiful creature of darkness,

02:00:32.031 --> 02:00:37.338
What kind of life have you known?

02:00:37.837 --> 02:00:42.628
God give me courage to show you,

02:00:43.029 --> 02:00:49.736
You are not alone...

02:01:41.026 --> 02:01:45.333
Track down this murderer, he must be found!
Take her, forget me,

02:01:45.368 --> 02:01:46.333
Forget all of this...

02:01:46.734 --> 02:01:53.837
Hunt out this animal, who runs to ground! Leave me alone - forget all you've seen...

02:01:53.872 --> 02:01:55.598
Go now - don't let them find you!

02:01:55.633 --> 02:01:59.627
Take the boat, swear to me, never to tell

02:02:01.930 --> 02:02:05.135
The secret you know, of the angel in hell!

02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:15.434
Go now - go now and leave me!

02:02:40.029 --> 02:02:42.630
Masquerade

02:02:42.934 --> 02:02:46.127
Paper faces on parade...

02:02:46.162 --> 02:02:47.425
Masquerade

02:02:47.723 --> 02:02:55.527
Hide your face so the world will never find you...

02:03:04.030 --> 02:03:11.830
Christine, I love you...

02:04:02.427 --> 02:04:12.225
Say you'll share with me one love, one lifetime

02:04:12.525 --> 02:04:22.886
Say the word and I will follow you...

02:04:22.921 --> 02:04:33.822
Share each day with me, each night, each morning...

02:04:34.222 --> 02:04:42.620
You alone, can make my song take flight

02:04:43.019 --> 02:04:54.926
It's over now, the music of the night

02:06:59.118 --> 02:07:01.322
"Countess de Chagny
Beloved wife and mother"

02:07:02.521 --> 02:07:05.019
"Chrisine 1854-1917"

02:08:21.915 --> 02:08:26.615
Child of the wilderness

02:08:27.016 --> 02:08:31.515
Born into emptiness

02:08:31.813 --> 02:08:36.215
Learn to be lonely

02:08:36.717 --> 02:08:42.709
Learn to find your way in darkness

02:08:42.744 --> 02:08:47.634
Who will be there for you

02:08:47.669 --> 02:08:52.508
Comfort and care for you

02:08:52.542 --> 02:08:57.981
Learn to be lonely

02:08:58.016 --> 02:09:03.058
Learn to be your one companion

02:09:03.094 --> 02:09:08.116
Never dreamed out in the world

02:09:08.714 --> 02:09:13.413
There are arms to hold you?

02:09:13.446 --> 02:09:18.280
You've always known

02:09:18.314 --> 02:09:24.162
Your heart was on its own

02:09:24.197 --> 02:09:29.403
So laugh in your loneliness

02:09:29.445 --> 02:09:34.616
Child of the wilderness

02:09:34.650 --> 02:09:39.573
Learn to be lonely

02:09:39.608 --> 02:09:47.510
Learn how to love life that is lived alone

02:09:55.512 --> 02:09:59.516
Learn to be lonely

02:10:00.304 --> 02:10:03.618
Life can be lived

02:10:03.653 --> 02:10:06.907
Life can be loved

02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:11.708
Alone.
