05:36.083 --> 05:40.412
It's an impressive collection.
You have some very rare editions.

05:41.130 --> 05:42.873
Are you sure
you want to sell them?

05:43.090 --> 05:45.296
They're no use to Father,
not anymore.

05:45.717 --> 05:47.924
Not since he's been this way.

05:48.178 --> 05:50.634
His library was his whole world,
now it's just

05:50.848 --> 05:52.223
a painful memory.

05:52.391 --> 05:54.099
Unbearably painful.

05:55.936 --> 05:57.216
I understand.

06:00.399 --> 06:03.934
Well, at a rough,
preliminary estimate,

06:04.194 --> 06:05.819
you have a collection here

06:06.613 --> 06:08.024
worth around 00,000 dollars.

06:10.325 --> 06:11.654
Yes, or thereabouts.

06:12.953 --> 06:13.984
I've picked out

06:14.204 --> 06:16.660
one or two volumes that
merit special attention.

06:16.874 --> 06:19.495
This "Persiles", for example,
is important.

06:19.835 --> 06:23.619
I'd hang on to that, it'll never
depreciate. It's a good investment.

06:23.839 --> 06:24.870
Valuable?

06:25.090 --> 06:26.335
Very valuable.

06:27.009 --> 06:30.175
As for this
"Hypnerotomachia di Poliphilo"

06:30.763 --> 06:33.336
by Colonna, Venice, 1545...

06:34.516 --> 06:36.842
I'n sure I could find you a buyer.

06:37.061 --> 06:40.014
But don't let the rest go
for less than 500,000

06:40.314 --> 06:41.938
under any circumstances.

06:43.609 --> 06:45.317
It may take a month
to place them.

06:45.486 --> 06:47.277
In the meantime, be patient.

06:47.446 --> 06:48.359
A month?

06:48.530 --> 06:51.780
Yes, a month or two. Depends
how much of a hurry you're in.

06:52.034 --> 06:53.362
More hurry, less money.

06:55.662 --> 06:57.205
That's my advice, anyway.

06:57.539 --> 06:59.579
I'm sure you wouldn't want
to rush things.

06:59.792 --> 07:04.370
But feel free to consult another
expert. You know where to reach me.

07:04.588 --> 07:07.874
Incidentally...
This four volume edition

07:08.133 --> 07:12.178
of "Don Quixote" is quite nice
but not particularly valuable.

07:12.387 --> 07:14.795
Now, I could

07:15.015 --> 07:17.257
take it off your hands...

07:18.352 --> 07:19.383
right away.

07:23.232 --> 07:25.473
How much were you thinking of...?

07:26.568 --> 07:29.937
I couldn't go more
than 4,000... 4,200 tops.

07:40.332 --> 07:41.791
- You here?
- Hello, Witkin.

07:42.042 --> 07:42.956
You don't waste time.

07:43.168 --> 07:45.494
There's a fortune in there.
Help yourself.

07:45.712 --> 07:47.871
You're a vulture, Corso.
A vulture.

07:48.090 --> 07:49.465
Who isn't in our business?

07:49.675 --> 07:50.706
You'd stoop to anything.

07:50.926 --> 07:52.835
For a "Quixote" by Ybarra?
You bet.

07:53.053 --> 07:56.173
Unscrupulous!
Thoroughly unscrupulous!

07:56.390 --> 07:58.050
Happy hunting!

08:17.619 --> 08:21.569
Just got off the phone with Witkin.
He's spitting blood.

08:22.124 --> 08:24.081
Really? What's his problem?

08:26.545 --> 08:30.128
He said you're a double-dealing,
money-grubbing bastard.

08:31.258 --> 08:35.422
He thought he had that deal sewed
up, he said you queered his pitch.

08:35.636 --> 08:37.630
He should be quicker
off the mark.

08:40.601 --> 08:43.684
He said your valuation
was way over the top,

08:44.104 --> 08:46.726
got those people
coming out in a rash.

08:47.149 --> 08:50.269
They're asking twice
what the books are worth.

08:56.492 --> 08:57.238
Let's face it,

08:57.451 --> 08:59.242
you screwed him.
That's what it's called.

08:59.453 --> 09:00.532
That's what it's called.

09:00.746 --> 09:02.904
He also said
you snatched the "Don..."

09:10.756 --> 09:14.504
Ybarra "Don Quixote", 1780,

09:15.052 --> 09:17.424
all four volumes.

09:21.433 --> 09:23.841
Fantastic, you are the best.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.889
That client of yours, the Swiss.
Would he still be interested?

09:28.107 --> 09:31.061
I'd have Witkin on my ass.
I told him I had no part of this.

09:31.485 --> 09:33.145
Except 10%%% .

09:34.071 --> 09:36.526
20%% %, the Swiss was my client.

09:37.157 --> 09:38.153
No deal.

09:38.367 --> 09:41.534
- 15. For my children's sake.
- You don't have any children.

09:41.703 --> 09:43.162
I'm still young, give me time.

09:44.415 --> 09:45.031
Ten.

10:27.207 --> 10:30.576
...and earlier, en 1580, in
"De la DËmonomanie des sorciers"

10:30.794 --> 10:32.621
by the Frenchman, Jean Bodin.

10:33.046 --> 10:36.047
Bodin was probably
the first to attempt

10:36.258 --> 10:38.464
to establish a system-
if the term

10:38.635 --> 10:42.763
system may be applied to
the Middle Ages- for classifying

10:42.973 --> 10:44.633
contemporary perceptions of evil.

10:45.476 --> 10:47.184
In Bodin we find
one of the first

10:47.436 --> 10:49.594
definitions of the word "witch".

10:50.189 --> 10:51.647
I quote:

10:52.608 --> 10:53.390
"A witch

10:53.609 --> 10:56.396
is a person who, though cognizant
of the laws of God,

10:56.737 --> 11:00.782
endeavors to act through a medium
of a pact with the Devil."

11:01.366 --> 11:04.735
To assist them in their work,
many witches kept familiars,

11:04.995 --> 11:07.782
creatures such as cats or toads,

11:08.040 --> 11:12.251
in which supernatural spirits
or demons were thought to reside.

11:12.711 --> 11:15.748
For those of you who wish
to delve more deeply

11:15.964 --> 11:18.337
into the controversial
subject of witchcraft,

11:18.550 --> 11:22.595
a great deal of information may
be found in the following works:

11:22.763 --> 11:25.966
Nicolas Remes
"Demonolatria libre",

11:26.183 --> 11:29.634
and "Compendium maleficam"
by Francesco Maria Guazo.

11:39.196 --> 11:43.407
I see you were stimulated
by my little talk, Mr. Corso.

11:47.329 --> 11:48.278
Did I snore?

11:48.497 --> 11:52.329
It's nice of you to ask.
No, not that I noticed.

12:03.512 --> 12:05.920
- Don't you sleep nights?
- Like a baby.

12:06.181 --> 12:07.640
Strange.

12:07.850 --> 12:12.559
I'd have bet a brace of Gutenberg
Bibles you were up all night.

12:13.063 --> 12:17.855
You're one of those hungry, restless
types that put the wind up Caesar,

12:18.444 --> 12:21.065
men who stab their friends
in the back.

12:24.616 --> 12:28.151
Not, I suspect, that you have many
friends. Do you, Mr. Corso?

12:28.412 --> 12:30.286
Your kind seldom does.

12:30.497 --> 12:32.122
That makes two of us.

12:39.423 --> 12:41.131
You're right, of course.

12:41.383 --> 12:43.874
Your friendships don't concern me
in the least.

12:44.094 --> 12:47.629
Our relations have always been
strictly commercial. I like that.

12:47.806 --> 12:50.973
The professional and the personal
should be mutually exclusive.

12:51.185 --> 12:54.351
I came here to do some business,
not shoot the breeze.

12:54.772 --> 12:58.306
If you want to expound your personal
philosophies, write another book.

12:58.525 --> 12:59.688
You don't like me, do you?

12:59.902 --> 13:02.357
I don't have to.
You're a client and you pay well.

13:18.295 --> 13:22.708
You're privileged, Mr. Corso. Very
few people ever set foot in here.

13:22.883 --> 13:24.377
This is my private collection.

13:26.136 --> 13:29.470
Some bibliophiles specialize
in Gothic novels,

13:29.723 --> 13:30.637
others in books of hours.

13:31.975 --> 13:35.226
All my own rare editions
have the same protagonist:

13:35.854 --> 13:36.720
The Devil.

13:36.897 --> 13:39.269
- May I take a look?
- Yes, that's why

13:39.525 --> 13:40.770
I brought you here.

13:56.917 --> 13:58.411
Beautiful, aren't they?

13:59.253 --> 14:02.622
The soft sheen,
the suberb gilding...

14:03.549 --> 14:06.585
Not to mention the centuries
of wisdom they contain.

14:06.802 --> 14:09.423
I know people who'd kill
for a collection like this.

14:10.472 --> 14:12.097
The "Ars Diavoli"!

14:12.724 --> 14:16.769
You'll never see as many books on
the subject anywhere in the world.

14:17.229 --> 14:20.479
They're the rarest,
the choicest editions in existence.

14:20.733 --> 14:23.058
It's taken me a lifetime
to assemble them.

14:24.111 --> 14:26.234
Only the supreme masterpiece
was missing.

14:36.665 --> 14:39.156
"The Nine Gates of the Kingdom
of the Shadows".

14:39.376 --> 14:43.326
- You're familiar with it?
- Yes. Venice, 1.

14:43.547 --> 14:47.711
The author and printer, A. Torchia,
was burned by the Holy Inquisition,

14:48.010 --> 14:49.208
along with all his works.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.213
Only three copies survived.

14:52.431 --> 14:53.296
One.

14:54.141 --> 14:57.889
Catalogs list three copies: The
Fargas, the Kessler and the Telfer.

14:58.562 --> 15:01.563
You know your business,
but you're mistaken.

15:02.191 --> 15:05.310
According to my research,
only one is authentic.

15:05.527 --> 15:06.393
Three are known.

15:07.654 --> 15:09.030
That's the trouble.

15:09.990 --> 15:13.157
- Where did you get it?
- I bought it from Telfer.

15:13.744 --> 15:16.235
- Telfer?
- He finally sold it to me.

15:16.455 --> 15:18.494
The day before he killed himself.

15:19.416 --> 15:20.958
It's good timing.

15:32.513 --> 15:35.514
- "Silence is golden".
- Precisely.

15:36.809 --> 15:38.848
Never heard of the "Delomelanicon"?

15:39.269 --> 15:41.974
I've heard of it.
It's a myth, isn't it?

15:42.481 --> 15:44.770
A book reputed to have been
written by Satan himself.

15:44.983 --> 15:47.688
No myth. That book existed.

15:47.945 --> 15:50.068
Torchia actually acquired it.

15:53.367 --> 15:57.032
The engravings you're admiring
were adapted by Torchia

15:57.246 --> 15:58.788
from the "Delomelanicon".

15:59.331 --> 16:02.166
The form a kind
of satanic riddle.

16:03.377 --> 16:05.998
Correctly interpreted
with the aid of the original text

16:06.255 --> 16:10.418
and inside information, they
conjure up the Prince of Darkness

16:10.634 --> 16:11.583
in person.

16:12.136 --> 16:13.381
You don't say.

16:15.055 --> 16:17.095
Are you a religious man?

16:17.307 --> 16:20.225
I mean, do you believe
in the supernatural?

16:20.477 --> 16:22.517
I believe in my percentage.

16:25.190 --> 16:27.099
Don't you get dizzy
standing there?

16:31.071 --> 16:33.443
What is it you want
from me, Balkan?

16:39.663 --> 16:41.407
I want you to go to Europe
and investigate.

16:42.166 --> 16:45.914
The other two copies are in
Portugal and France, I want you to

16:46.086 --> 16:47.960
find some way of comparing
them with mine:

16:48.130 --> 16:51.878
Every page, every engraving, the
binding, everything. I'm convinced

16:52.050 --> 16:54.043
only one is authentic.
I want to know which.

16:54.261 --> 16:55.720
That could be an expensive trip.

16:57.681 --> 17:00.801
That's to get you started.
Spend what you need.

17:03.187 --> 17:06.805
- What if I find yours is a forgery?
- It's quite possible.

17:10.652 --> 17:12.526
It doesn't appear to be.

17:15.281 --> 17:16.906
Even the paper sounds kosher.

17:17.076 --> 17:19.648
Even so.
There's something wrong.

17:19.869 --> 17:21.743
You mean the Devil
won't show up?

17:24.625 --> 17:28.788
If all three copies turn out bogus
or incomplete, your work's done.

17:29.046 --> 17:32.213
If one of them turns out to be
genuine, I'll finance you further.

17:33.425 --> 17:35.050
I want you to get it for me,

17:35.594 --> 17:38.050
at all costs, never mind how.

17:38.263 --> 17:40.256
"Never mind how"
sounds illegal.

17:40.808 --> 17:42.931
Wouldn't be the first time
you've done something illegal.

17:43.102 --> 17:44.097
Not that illegal.

17:44.311 --> 17:46.185
Hence the size of the check.

17:51.193 --> 17:53.186
Do a good job,
I'll double it.

17:57.408 --> 18:00.444
There's something wrong with it if
you're letting it out of your hands.

18:01.203 --> 18:02.863
I have the utmost faith
in you, Mr. Corso.

18:03.080 --> 18:06.615
There's nothing more reliable than
a man who can be bought for cash.

19:06.477 --> 19:08.718
Good morning. Dean Corso.

19:09.313 --> 19:12.682
I'm terribly sorry to disturb
you at a time like this.

19:24.286 --> 19:28.948
It would be very helpful, if you
could tell me what you know about

19:29.166 --> 19:30.329
this book.

19:38.801 --> 19:40.425
Isn't this one
of my husband's books?

19:42.221 --> 19:45.554
It was in his collection until
recently. He sold it to my client.

19:46.141 --> 19:47.968
I'm trying to authenticate it.

19:48.185 --> 19:49.513
He sold it, you say?

19:50.145 --> 19:52.897
How strange. This was one of
his most treasured possessions.

19:53.273 --> 19:56.109
- He never mentioned the sale?
- No, it's news to me.

19:57.444 --> 20:00.018
- Who bought it?
- A private collector.

20:00.948 --> 20:02.323
May I know his name?

20:03.659 --> 20:05.283
I'm afraid
that's confidential.

20:05.702 --> 20:08.869
- I suppose he has a bill of sale.
- No problem there.

20:09.081 --> 20:12.035
Is this your job,
authenticating rare books?

20:12.251 --> 20:14.042
And tracking them down, yes.

20:14.837 --> 20:16.165
You're a book detective.

20:16.338 --> 20:17.536
Kind of.

20:19.591 --> 20:22.296
Do you recall when and where
your husband acquired this book?

20:24.763 --> 20:25.926
In Spain.

20:26.515 --> 20:30.809
We were vacationing in Toledo.
Andrew got very excited.

20:31.437 --> 20:32.979
He paid a great deal
of money for it.

20:34.690 --> 20:36.682
He was a fanatical collector.

20:36.942 --> 20:37.689
So I gather.

20:39.486 --> 20:40.767
I'll show you.

21:02.342 --> 21:03.623
Impressive...

21:03.969 --> 21:07.136
Andrew used to spend
many hours in here.

21:08.557 --> 21:09.636
Too many.

21:09.850 --> 21:11.344
Did he ever try it out?

21:12.352 --> 21:13.811
I don't understand.

21:14.438 --> 21:15.184
The book.

21:15.939 --> 21:19.143
Did he ever use it to perform
some kind of ritual intended to...

21:19.318 --> 21:21.690
produce a supernatural effect?

21:21.945 --> 21:24.697
- Are you serious?
- Yes, absolutely.

21:25.532 --> 21:28.319
Andrew was a trifle eccentric,
Mr. Corso,

21:29.119 --> 21:30.993
but he wasn't insane.

21:31.330 --> 21:33.536
It's true he'd been
acting strangely

21:34.958 --> 21:36.785
those last few days.

21:37.002 --> 21:41.331
He shut himself up in here.
He seldom emerged except for meals.

21:42.091 --> 21:46.551
That morning I was woken
by the screams of the maid.

21:50.766 --> 21:52.390
He'd hanged himself.

21:56.313 --> 21:57.855
Whatever he was up to,

21:58.107 --> 22:02.484
I can't see him chanting mumbo-jumbo
or trying to raise the dead.

22:02.694 --> 22:04.771
The Devil, Mrs. Telfer.

22:05.781 --> 22:07.572
This book is designed
to raise the Devil.

23:04.214 --> 23:06.622
"Thus let the line shine."

26:03.644 --> 26:06.728
Son of a bitch.
Where did you get this?

26:06.939 --> 26:07.935
Balkan.

26:08.357 --> 26:10.266
He wants me to research it.

26:11.026 --> 26:13.268
Balkan owns a "Nine Gates"?

26:13.487 --> 26:16.404
Recently acquired from the
late lamented Andrew Telfer.

26:16.615 --> 26:17.694
Trust Balkan.

26:17.950 --> 26:21.153
What does he need you for?
I don't suppose he plans to sell it.

26:21.620 --> 26:26.578
He wants me to compare it with
the copies in Portugal and France.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.577
So I'm off to Europe.

26:28.752 --> 26:29.748
Compare it?

26:30.587 --> 26:33.588
Yeah. Only one of the three
is authentic, he says.

26:34.883 --> 26:36.627
Well, this looks
genuine enough.

26:37.302 --> 26:41.549
Christ, it's got to be worth
a million. Take care of it.

26:41.723 --> 26:44.890
That's why I'm here.
I need you to stash it for me.

26:45.686 --> 26:47.228
Because I'm starting
to see things.

26:47.521 --> 26:48.801
- Like what?
- Uninvited visitors,

26:49.022 --> 26:51.015
unfamiliar faces.

26:51.567 --> 26:53.939
I don't trust anyone,
not even Balkan.

26:54.862 --> 26:56.522
Come to think of it,
I'm not even sure I trust you.

26:57.406 --> 27:01.819
I'd only screw you for a good
reason: Money, women, business.

27:02.161 --> 27:04.118
Other than that,
you can relax.

27:05.205 --> 27:07.577
I'll pick it up on my way
to the airport.

27:09.418 --> 27:10.960
These engravings are terrific.

27:11.837 --> 27:13.628
Or horrific, whatever.

27:14.339 --> 27:15.798
Sensational.

28:01.303 --> 28:02.382
May I come in?

28:12.773 --> 28:13.852
Please sit down.

28:17.736 --> 28:19.729
I've come to talk business.

28:22.741 --> 28:23.939
Yesterday, when you
came to see me

28:24.159 --> 28:25.404
about that book,

28:27.371 --> 28:30.288
I was too surprised to react
as I should have done.

28:30.499 --> 28:32.907
I mean, it really was
one of Andrew's favorites.

28:33.669 --> 28:34.700
So you said.

28:35.129 --> 28:36.837
I'd like to get it back.

28:39.007 --> 28:40.550
That could be a problem.

28:40.759 --> 28:42.040
Not necessarily.
It all depends.

28:42.302 --> 28:44.010
- On what?
- On you.

28:45.097 --> 28:47.884
I don't understand. That book
is not mine to dispose of.

28:57.818 --> 28:59.360
You work for money,
I take it?

28:59.570 --> 29:00.519
What else?

29:00.738 --> 29:03.229
- I have a great deal of money.
- I'm very happy for you.

29:03.449 --> 29:04.907
You could stage a theft.

29:05.117 --> 29:07.359
I imagine your client is
well assured.

29:07.619 --> 29:10.157
- I'm a professional, ma'am.
- You're a professional mercenary.

29:10.748 --> 29:13.748
- They work for the highest bidder.
- I make a living.

29:14.585 --> 29:16.127
I could throw in a bonus.

29:18.088 --> 29:21.504
- This has happened before someplace.
- I know. In the movies.

29:21.717 --> 29:23.211
And she had an automatic
in her stocking.

29:27.890 --> 29:29.265
No automatic.

29:38.984 --> 29:41.273
- Like a drink?
- Why not?

31:13.454 --> 31:15.245
Okay, where is it?

31:15.789 --> 31:17.118
Where is what?

31:17.916 --> 31:19.790
Don't fuck with me!

31:21.837 --> 31:23.461
I thought I already did.

31:54.995 --> 31:59.538
Bernie's Rare Books, please leave
your message after the beep.

32:04.922 --> 32:05.953
Pick up!

32:35.661 --> 32:36.823
Give me a minute,
I won't be long.

32:37.538 --> 32:40.373
- You can take me on to Kennedy.
- No problem, sir.

34:36.782 --> 34:38.275
No problem?

35:16.655 --> 35:18.399
Stop at that phone booth,
pull over.

35:18.615 --> 35:19.860
No problem, sir.

35:26.749 --> 35:28.955
He isn't available at this time.
Who's calling?

35:30.419 --> 35:34.084
- Would you like to leave a message?
- No, I have to talk with him.

35:34.298 --> 35:35.578
I'm afraid he's in transit.

35:35.799 --> 35:38.884
If you give me your number,
I'll have him call.

35:39.136 --> 35:42.256
No, I'm in a phone booth!
It's an emergency!

35:42.931 --> 35:46.881
I have to speak with him right now.
Right now! You hear me?

35:48.979 --> 35:49.893
One moment.

36:08.665 --> 36:10.160
- Are you there, Mr. Corso?
- Yes.

36:10.375 --> 36:11.407
I'll patch you through.

36:15.964 --> 36:18.040
Mr. Corso, what have you
got for me?

36:18.217 --> 36:19.627
More than I bargained for.

36:19.885 --> 36:22.210
- What do you mean?
- I mean I quit.

36:22.638 --> 36:24.511
I want to return the book.
Where are you?

36:24.765 --> 36:28.928
I'm disappointed in you, Mr. Corso.
You've never let me down before.

36:29.311 --> 36:31.185
Well, this is different.

36:31.688 --> 36:33.515
You remember Bernie Orenstein?

36:34.900 --> 36:38.067
- The dealer?
- I gave him your book to stash,

36:38.320 --> 36:40.313
and now he's dead.
Murdered.

36:40.614 --> 36:43.105
- Because of the book?
- What else?

36:45.244 --> 36:48.363
I never said it would be easy.
If it's a question of money...

36:48.580 --> 36:50.075
It isn't the money.
I want out.

36:50.249 --> 36:52.870
This matter means a great deal
to me, Mr. Corso.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.994
I'm not an ungenerous man,
you know that.

36:55.212 --> 36:59.044
Proceed as arranged, and you can
tack another zero onto your fee.

37:01.677 --> 37:03.052
Hey, where are you?

38:05.991 --> 38:08.363
I would like to get
your opinion on this.

38:20.380 --> 38:22.457
What a habit for a bookbinder!

38:23.092 --> 38:26.674
"The Nine Gates".
Suberb edition. Very rare.

38:27.346 --> 38:28.544
The Telfer copy.

38:29.306 --> 38:32.141
Yes. You used to own it, right?

38:32.351 --> 38:33.133
- We used to, yes.
- We sold it.

38:33.310 --> 38:36.845
When the opportunity presented
itself. It was too good to...

38:37.064 --> 38:39.140
...it was too good to miss.
An excellent sale.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.104
An excellent buy,
impeccable condition.

38:42.277 --> 38:44.603
Impeccable.
Are you the present owner?

38:44.822 --> 38:46.446
No, a client of mine.

38:46.907 --> 38:50.323
I never would have believed
she would part with it, never.

38:50.994 --> 38:52.738
- She?
- Mrs. Telfer.

38:55.582 --> 38:56.697
I understood

38:56.917 --> 38:58.577
that it was Mr. Telfer...
that bought it.

38:58.794 --> 38:59.957
He paid for it.

39:00.254 --> 39:03.504
Mrs. Telfer made him buy it.
He didn't seem particularly...

39:03.715 --> 39:04.960
...interested.

39:06.343 --> 39:08.632
An exceptional specimen.

39:08.929 --> 39:12.298
- Do you think it could be a forgery?
- A forgery? You hear that, Pablo?

39:12.516 --> 39:16.134
I took you for a professional.
You speak too lightly of forgeries.

39:16.311 --> 39:17.592
Far too lightly.

39:17.813 --> 39:20.684
Forging a book is very expensive.

39:20.899 --> 39:25.193
Paper of the period, the right inks.
Too expensive to be profitable.

39:25.404 --> 39:27.231
- Still, it can be done.
- Of course.

39:28.115 --> 39:30.191
Well, it requires great skill,
but yes, it can be done.

39:30.409 --> 39:32.236
Do you think that could be
the case here?

39:32.578 --> 39:33.573
What makes you ask?

39:33.787 --> 39:37.488
My client wishes to satsify himself
on the book's authenticity.

39:38.667 --> 39:40.992
His name is Boris Balkan.
Boris Balkan of New York.

39:41.253 --> 39:44.420
- All books have their own destiny.
- And their own life.

39:45.007 --> 39:47.877
Mr. Balkan is
a celebrated collector.

39:48.135 --> 39:51.052
He's no fool, he must know
this book is authentic.

39:51.388 --> 39:54.259
- We know it.
- We had this book for years.

39:54.475 --> 39:55.340
Many years.

39:55.559 --> 39:58.679
We had ample opportunity to study
it thoroughly. The printing,

39:58.896 --> 40:03.522
the binding are great examples of
17th century Venetian craftsmanship.

40:03.984 --> 40:07.400
Finest rag paper, resistant
to the passage of time!

40:08.197 --> 40:10.236
None of your modern wood pulp!

40:10.616 --> 40:12.407
Watermarks, ink,

40:12.618 --> 40:14.242
type faces...

40:14.578 --> 40:16.203
If this is a forgery,

40:16.371 --> 40:19.491
or a copy with missing pages
restored, it's the work of a master.

40:22.252 --> 40:26.416
Have you studied the engravings?
They seem to have some underlying

40:26.632 --> 40:27.248
significance.

40:27.466 --> 40:28.629
But of course.

40:28.842 --> 40:29.874
Here, for example.

40:30.177 --> 40:32.668
This one could be interpreted
as a warning.

40:32.888 --> 40:36.838
"Venture too far," It seems to say,
"and danger will descend on you."

40:38.060 --> 40:39.768
This tye of books
often contain

40:39.978 --> 40:40.725
little puzzles.

40:40.938 --> 40:43.974
Especially in the case of such
an illustrious collaborator.

40:44.441 --> 40:45.556
Collaborator?

40:45.776 --> 40:46.357
You cannot

40:46.568 --> 40:48.894
have proceeded very far
with your research, Seòor.

40:49.238 --> 40:49.984
Here, look close.

40:50.906 --> 40:54.571
Don't you see? Only six of
the nine engravings were signed by

40:54.785 --> 40:55.531
Aristide Torchia.

40:55.744 --> 40:57.951
Yes. And the other three?

40:58.622 --> 41:00.200
But this is one of them.

41:04.878 --> 41:05.660
Who is LCF?

41:05.879 --> 41:06.745
Think.

41:13.512 --> 41:14.259
Lucifer?

41:15.973 --> 41:19.009
Very perceptive of you, seòor.

41:20.310 --> 41:24.937
Torchia was burned alive because
he wrote this book in collaboration.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.272
Come on! You can't
honestly believe...

41:27.484 --> 41:30.770
The man who wrote this book
did so in alliance with the Devil

41:30.988 --> 41:32.316
and went to the stake for it.

41:32.489 --> 41:35.194
Even Hell has
its heroes, Seòor.

43:30.357 --> 43:32.682
- I've seen you before.
- Have you?

43:35.487 --> 43:38.109
- Are you traveling in this car?
- The next one.

43:38.365 --> 43:41.449
The sleeper.
I travel on the cheap.

43:43.287 --> 43:46.204
- You're a student?
- Something like that.

43:47.416 --> 43:48.791
I like trains.

43:49.209 --> 43:51.961
- Trains I'm on?
- Just trains.

43:55.591 --> 43:56.789
What's your name?

43:57.426 --> 43:58.422
Guess.

44:00.596 --> 44:01.710
- Green eyes.
- That'll do.

44:03.056 --> 44:05.429
- What's yours?
- Corso.

44:05.601 --> 44:06.799
Strange name.

44:07.686 --> 44:09.595
Italian. It means "run".

44:10.272 --> 44:14.056
You don't look like a runner
to me. More the quiet type.

44:19.990 --> 44:23.525
Give my regards to Balkan.
Tell him I'm doing my best.

44:25.829 --> 44:26.908
Never mind.

44:27.539 --> 44:29.283
See you around.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.411
Maybe.

44:32.836 --> 44:34.663
I wouldn't be surprised.

46:14.938 --> 46:17.145
Yes, Dean Corso, Mr. Fargas.

46:17.399 --> 46:21.100
Corso, oh, yes.
Please come in.

46:35.042 --> 46:36.501
Home, sweet home.

46:40.839 --> 46:43.626
You won't say no to a brandy,
I take it.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.652
What handsome glasses.

47:03.946 --> 47:06.188
They're the only ones
I have left.

47:10.411 --> 47:13.411
- Must have been a beautiful place.
- It was.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.868
But old families are
like ancient civilizations:

47:17.084 --> 47:18.495
They wither and die.

47:21.964 --> 47:25.712
There they are,
834 of them.

47:25.926 --> 47:28.761
A pity you didn't see them
in better times.

47:28.971 --> 47:30.169
I used to have 5,000.

47:30.722 --> 47:33.178
But these are the survivors.

47:33.392 --> 47:35.266
So this is
the Fargas collection.

47:35.769 --> 47:38.307
Not quite as I imagined it,
I must say.

47:38.647 --> 47:40.225
C'est la vie, my friend.

47:40.482 --> 47:44.812
I keep them in perfect condition,
safe from damp, light, heat, rats.

47:45.571 --> 47:47.444
I dust and air them everyday.

47:52.578 --> 47:54.369
These are the occults.

47:55.080 --> 47:57.867
- What do you think?
- Not bad.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.663
Not bad indeed. At least ten
of them are extremely rare.

48:00.836 --> 48:04.122
Here, Plancy's
"Dictionnaire Infernal",

48:05.924 --> 48:09.009
first edition, 1844.

48:11.513 --> 48:15.843
Leonardo Fioravanti's
"Compendi di Secreti", 1571.

48:21.940 --> 48:23.518
And there it is,

48:24.109 --> 48:25.734
in perfect condition.

48:30.282 --> 48:34.991
After three and a half centuries,
it may have been printed yesterday.

48:36.121 --> 48:39.371
Is it in order? You haven't
detected anything unusual?

48:41.085 --> 48:44.785
The text is complete, the
engravings, too. 9 & the title page,

48:45.047 --> 48:49.091
just as the catalogs state. Just
like the Kessler and the Telfer.

48:50.469 --> 48:53.174
It isn't the Telfer anymore.

48:53.388 --> 48:54.931
Telfer killed himself.

48:55.349 --> 48:58.433
But he sold his copy
to Boris Balkan first.

49:01.063 --> 49:04.064
If he sets his heart on a book,
no price is too high.

49:04.274 --> 49:07.857
Not that I would ever sell
this one, not at any price.

49:09.613 --> 49:13.777
It's strange he should have
sent you here,

49:13.951 --> 49:16.193
if he already had...

49:18.205 --> 49:19.485
You have it here?

49:21.125 --> 49:22.323
May I see it?

49:41.186 --> 49:43.143
Superb.

49:48.193 --> 49:51.858
Beautiful, identical.

49:52.364 --> 49:54.653
Two of the only three
to escape the flames,

49:54.867 --> 49:57.108
reunited for the first time
in over three centuries.

49:59.204 --> 50:00.367
Yes.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.869
Look at this slight imperfection,
the damaged "S".

50:05.377 --> 50:07.915
The same type,
the same impression.

50:13.343 --> 50:14.672
And you see?
If it weren't for this

50:14.887 --> 50:17.212
slight discoloration
on the back of your copy,

50:17.431 --> 50:19.055
no one could
tell them apart.

50:19.850 --> 50:23.682
If you don't mind, I'd like
to stay and examine them in detail.

50:27.441 --> 50:29.647
What are you looking for,
Mr. Corso?

50:30.360 --> 50:31.985
I'm not quite sure.

50:32.613 --> 50:35.946
Some books are dangerous.
Not to be opened with impunity.

50:37.159 --> 50:38.274
It's very true.

54:17.337 --> 54:18.417
Hello again.

54:19.631 --> 54:22.039
- You didn't say you'd be in Sintra.
- Neither did you.

54:22.217 --> 54:23.131
What are you doing here?

54:23.677 --> 54:24.756
Reading.

54:25.179 --> 54:26.293
I can see that.

54:26.513 --> 54:28.885
And bumping into people
unexpectedly.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.972
Yes, unexpectedly is right.

54:33.854 --> 54:37.603
Are you on a business trip?
Is that why you always carry that?

54:44.239 --> 54:46.647
- Is this part of your course?
- My course?

54:47.117 --> 54:50.866
Winning friends and influencing
people. You said you were a student.

54:51.080 --> 54:52.075
Did I?

54:52.664 --> 54:55.037
So I am. In a way.

54:56.877 --> 54:59.546
I like books. Do you?

55:03.634 --> 55:05.922
- You've been traveling long?
- Awhile.

55:07.179 --> 55:09.006
I don't suppose you ever
travel by motorbike?

55:11.850 --> 55:13.226
For me? Are you sure?

55:24.863 --> 55:26.939
My God! How did you find me?

55:27.324 --> 55:31.488
- Made any progress?
- Progress? You could call it that.

55:31.703 --> 55:32.902
Well?

55:33.705 --> 55:36.956
I can't talk here, I'm in the lobby.
Let me call you back. Where are you?

55:37.167 --> 55:40.785
Never mind that. Get them to
transfer it to your room. I'll wait.

55:44.633 --> 55:47.041
Could you send this
up to my room, please?

55:57.020 --> 55:58.563
- You still there?
- Yes.

55:59.064 --> 56:02.101
All right, I've examined
the Fargas copy.

56:02.317 --> 56:04.559
It's authentic enough,
at least it looks that way.

56:04.862 --> 56:07.613
It's like yours.
But there are discrepancies.

56:07.823 --> 56:09.068
Discrepancies?

56:11.034 --> 56:13.074
The engravings.
They're not identical.

56:13.662 --> 56:15.987
It's like keys
in different hands,

56:16.206 --> 56:18.876
doorways open in one copy
and bricked up in the other.

56:19.251 --> 56:22.335
- And there's another thing.
- Yes, yes, go on.

56:23.213 --> 56:27.875
The ones that differ aren't signed
by Torchia. They're signed "LCF".

56:30.679 --> 56:32.090
You still there?

56:32.556 --> 56:34.134
Where are you, anyway?

56:34.391 --> 56:36.514
I must have that copy,

56:37.352 --> 56:38.811
Mr. Corso. Get it for me.

56:39.813 --> 56:43.016
The old man wouldn't sell it
to save his life. He said as much.

56:43.650 --> 56:44.646
Did he?

57:21.355 --> 57:22.814
Just a minute.

57:41.750 --> 57:44.324
- What time is it?
- Early, but you have to go.

57:45.963 --> 57:47.125
Go? Go where?

57:47.381 --> 57:49.623
- The Fargas place.
- I've already seen Fargas.

57:49.842 --> 57:50.707
You should
see him again.

57:51.844 --> 57:55.010
Is this some kind of joke? Who are
you? What do you know about Fargas?

57:55.556 --> 57:57.762
Get dressed, I'll wait
for you outside.

58:41.643 --> 58:44.051
Don't bother. He isn't there.

58:44.480 --> 58:47.765
- Really? Then where is he?
- Over there.

59:33.237 --> 59:34.268
Want to get inside?

59:35.739 --> 59:37.317
I had thought about it, yes.

01:00:00.722 --> 01:00:02.181
You wait here.

01:00:50.481 --> 01:00:52.189
Well, did you find it?

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:56.394
It's coming to my attention
that you know too goddamn much.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.231
Why do you keep following me around?
Who are you working for?

01:00:58.447 --> 01:01:01.317
You're wasting time, asking these
questions. We'd better leave.

01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:04.985
There's a flight from Lisbon to
Paris at noon. We can just make it.

01:01:05.204 --> 01:01:07.529
- What's with the "we"?
- There are two of us, aren't there?

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:09.409
What happened back there?

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:18.715
The old man caught someone
stealing, I guess.

01:01:19.468 --> 01:01:22.255
- What do you guess happened to him?
- He drowned.

01:01:23.097 --> 01:01:25.766
- With a little help from who?
- He's dead. Who cares?

01:01:25.974 --> 01:01:27.303
I do.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.343
I could easily wind up
the same way.

01:01:30.979 --> 01:01:33.102
Not with me around
to look after you.

01:01:34.108 --> 01:01:37.559
- I see. You're my guardian angel.
- Lf you say so.

01:01:42.533 --> 01:01:46.447
- Someone's playing a game with me.
- Of course. You're part of it.

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:50.202
And you're getting
to like it.

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:41.749
Hello, Mr. Corso,
delighted to see you again.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:44.631
We don't have
any vacancies, but...

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:47.054
I'm sure I'll be able
to organize something.

01:03:47.783 --> 01:03:51.199
- Hello. The Kessler Foundation?
- The second floor.

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:25.445
I'm Dean Corso. I have an
appointment with Baroness Kessler.

01:04:41.378 --> 01:04:43.703
You have 30 minutes.

01:04:55.434 --> 01:04:57.676
I've heard a great deal
about you.

01:04:59.271 --> 01:05:02.142
- Nothing good, I hope.
- You hope right.

01:05:03.484 --> 01:05:05.357
Well, I'm reassured, Baroness.

01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:10.357
In my trade, to be spoken well of
can be professionally disastrous.

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:16.702
There it is,
the Kessler Collection.

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:22.159
You know, I know your catalog
almost by heart.

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:26.422
Strange we haven't met. Your name is
byword among dealers and collectors.

01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:30.963
But I imagine you know your
own reputation better than I do.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:34.381
Yes, well, it does keep the wolf
from the door, so to speak.

01:05:34.598 --> 01:05:36.306
I'm sorry, were you
in the middle of something?

01:05:36.517 --> 01:05:37.762
My latest work:

01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:40.894
"The Devil: History and Myth",
a kind of biography.

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:44.143
It will be published
early next year.

01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.606
- Why the Devil?
- I saw him one day.

01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:50.692
I was 15 years old and I saw him
as plain as I see you now.

01:05:51.156 --> 01:05:52.650
It was love at first sight.

01:05:52.866 --> 01:05:57.030
300 years ago you would have been
burned at the stake for saying that.

01:05:57.246 --> 01:05:59.737
300 years ago
I wouldn't have said it.

01:06:00.332 --> 01:06:03.333
Nor would I have made
a million by writing about it.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:07.953
What is it you wish to discuss,
Mr. Corso?

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:11.467
There's a book in your collection
I'd like to examine, if possible.

01:06:11.677 --> 01:06:13.800
"The Book of the Nine Gates
of the Kingdom of Shadows".

01:06:14.012 --> 01:06:16.800
"The Nine Gates"?
An interesting work.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.015
Everyone's been asking me
about it lately.

01:06:19.518 --> 01:06:20.514
Is that so?

01:06:20.728 --> 01:06:21.842
Follow me.

01:06:25.065 --> 01:06:28.150
You truly believe
in the Devil, Baroness?

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.895
Enough to devote my life
and my library to him,

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:33.982
not to mention many years

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:35.528
of work.

01:06:35.868 --> 01:06:36.982
Don't you?

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:38.359
Almost.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:42.905
This book demands
a certain amount of faith.

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:45.663
I'm afraid my faith
is in short supply these days.

01:06:46.211 --> 01:06:50.126
I know this book extremely well.
I studied it for years.

01:06:50.424 --> 01:06:52.001
You have any doubts
about its authenticity?

01:06:53.469 --> 01:06:54.500
None whatsoever.

01:06:54.762 --> 01:06:56.172
- You're sure?
- My knowledge

01:06:56.388 --> 01:06:57.763
of this book is profound.

01:06:58.223 --> 01:06:59.931
I wrote a biography
of its author.

01:07:00.142 --> 01:07:02.894
Yes, I read it: "Aristide Torchia,
the Devil's Apprentice".

01:07:03.103 --> 01:07:04.266
Excellent work.

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:06.230
A courageous man.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:10.390
He died for the sake
of this very book in 17.

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:13.103
While studying the black arts
in Prague,

01:07:13.614 --> 01:07:16.650
he acquired a copy
of the dread "Delomelanicon".

01:07:17.117 --> 01:07:21.245
This is Torchia's adaptation
of that work, written by Lucifer

01:07:21.455 --> 01:07:22.486
himself.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.081
After they burned him
at the stake,

01:07:24.291 --> 01:07:27.826
a secret society was founded
to perpetuate its memory

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:29.753
and preserve its secrets.

01:07:30.005 --> 01:07:31.286
The Order of the

01:07:31.507 --> 01:07:32.835
Silver Serpent.

01:07:33.342 --> 01:07:34.373
A sect?

01:07:34.593 --> 01:07:36.336
A kind of witches' coven.

01:07:36.553 --> 01:07:40.883
For centuries they've met to read
from the book and worship Lucifer.

01:07:41.725 --> 01:07:42.639
Today they've degenerated

01:07:42.851 --> 01:07:47.394
into a social club for bored
millionaires and celebrities

01:07:47.606 --> 01:07:49.895
who use its meetings
as an excuse

01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:52.564
to indulge their
jaded sexual appetites.

01:07:53.445 --> 01:07:55.402
I myself belonged to the Order

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:57.355
years ago,

01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.982
but time is too precious
at my age.

01:08:00.202 --> 01:08:02.444
Besides, my orgy days
are over.

01:08:02.663 --> 01:08:04.952
I told them to go
to the Devil.

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:08.452
You mean that it's
all about sex, or...?

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:09.873
Of course not.

01:08:10.129 --> 01:08:13.498
They're under the illusion they
owe their money and success

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:14.996
to membership in the Order.

01:08:15.259 --> 01:08:17.298
- Do they still meet?
- Every year,

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:19.420
on the anniversary
of Torchia's death.

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:21.756
They'll be meeting
very soon now.

01:08:21.974 --> 01:08:24.465
- And they read from this book?
- Not this one.

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:28.895
I took mine back when Liana Telfer
acquired the one in Toledo.

01:08:29.356 --> 01:08:31.148
Victor Fargas is an unbeliever.

01:08:31.358 --> 01:08:36.104
He always refused to participate,
so they use the Telfer copy.

01:08:36.321 --> 01:08:38.444
Not that it's ever worked.

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:40.068
Did Andrew Telfer take part?

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:43.113
Telfer? No, no.

01:08:43.912 --> 01:08:47.281
That creature. Liana married
him for his money.

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:50.786
She comes of an old and
aristocratic French family,

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:53.790
the Saint-Martins,
but they were penniless.

01:08:54.006 --> 01:08:57.090
Liana used his dollars
to restore her chateau

01:08:57.676 --> 01:08:59.466
and buy "The Nine Gates".

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:02.889
If he ever finds out what his wife
gets up to at these gatherings,

01:09:03.098 --> 01:09:04.890
he'll probably kill himself.

01:09:06.185 --> 01:09:09.220
Funny you should say that, Baroness.
He hanged himself last week.

01:09:13.942 --> 01:09:17.560
Who exactly are you working for,
Mr. Corso?

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.772
My client's name is irrelevant,
Baroness.

01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:22.149
I'm simply trying
to authenticate his copy,

01:09:22.367 --> 01:09:24.740
which is the one Telfer
sold him before he died.

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:27.953
How stupid of me!
I should have guessed!

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:32.867
You've outstayed your welcome,
Mr. Corso.

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:35.376
I was hoping to examine
your copy in detail.

01:09:35.589 --> 01:09:37.131
Certainly not.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:40.379
Tell your client,
who can only be Boris Balkan,

01:09:40.594 --> 01:09:44.259
to come and examine it
himself, if he dares.

01:09:45.474 --> 01:09:48.890
Tell him not to send any more
wolves in sheep's clothing.

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:51.100
And now,

01:09:51.313 --> 01:09:52.973
kindly leave.

01:09:56.026 --> 01:09:59.146
I'm sorry if I troubled you.

01:09:59.738 --> 01:10:01.019
Thank you very much
for your time.

01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:04.490
You don't know what you're getting
yourself into, Mr. Corso.

01:10:05.619 --> 01:10:07.861
Get out before it's too late.

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:10.948
I'm afraid
it already is, Baroness.

01:14:04.274 --> 01:14:05.437
They're broken.

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:08.817
You should be more careful.

01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:27.670
- I need a favor, Gruber.
- Certainly, Mr. Corso.

01:14:27.881 --> 01:14:29.459
Liana Telfer,

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:33.714
maiden name Saint-Martin.
Fortyish, brunette, dishy.

01:14:34.221 --> 01:14:36.344
Probably accompanied by

01:14:38.475 --> 01:14:41.262
a black gentleman with

01:14:42.187 --> 01:14:43.350
closely cropped

01:14:43.564 --> 01:14:46.849
platinum blond hair
and a mustache.

01:14:47.901 --> 01:14:49.609
I want to know if they're
staying at some hotel in Paris.

01:14:49.862 --> 01:14:51.938
- It could take a little time.
- Of course. Start

01:14:52.156 --> 01:14:53.780
with the five-stars.
That's your best bet.

01:14:55.534 --> 01:14:56.779
Are you feeling all right?

01:14:58.662 --> 01:15:00.868
I've felt better, Gruber.
Thanks.

01:15:01.915 --> 01:15:03.575
Let me know
if you locate them.

01:15:17.264 --> 01:15:18.213
Put this

01:15:19.683 --> 01:15:21.759
against the back
of your neck.

01:15:34.114 --> 01:15:36.486
You were really great
down there by the river.

01:15:37.618 --> 01:15:38.993
I haven't thanked you
for that.

01:16:23.455 --> 01:16:25.614
I think it's about time
you told me what's going on here.

01:16:26.834 --> 01:16:29.455
- Someone's after your book.
- No kidding.

01:16:29.753 --> 01:16:31.295
And you?
Where do you fit in?

01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:49.269
May I take it
in Reception, please?

01:16:50.858 --> 01:16:52.850
All right,
I'll be right down.

01:17:06.957 --> 01:17:08.914
- Yes?
- Anything new?

01:17:09.251 --> 01:17:11.374
Oh, "His Master's Voice" again.

01:17:11.712 --> 01:17:13.372
No, not much,

01:17:13.589 --> 01:17:16.922
aside from someone trying to
take my life a couple times.

01:17:17.509 --> 01:17:20.344
Oh, yes, and Fargas
has been murdered.

01:17:22.431 --> 01:17:24.470
Murdered?
How do you know?

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:27.257
I saw him...
and his copy.

01:17:27.519 --> 01:17:29.311
Or what was left of it anyway.

01:17:29.688 --> 01:17:33.139
Someone had snatched the engravings
and tried to burn the rest.

01:17:33.442 --> 01:17:34.770
What do you make of it?

01:17:34.943 --> 01:17:36.853
That's tragic, it's tragic.

01:17:37.029 --> 01:17:39.983
What about Baroness Kessler,
how did you get on today?

01:17:40.199 --> 01:17:42.950
- Where exactly are you?
- What about her copy?

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:47.288
No. Why do I get the impression
you've been breathing down my neck?

01:17:47.498 --> 01:17:51.365
You're an investment of mine.
I'm merely looking after it.

01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.706
The old woman swears
her copy's authentic,

01:17:57.925 --> 01:18:00.048
but I didn't get a chance
to examine it closely.

01:18:00.761 --> 01:18:04.212
She threw me out as soon as she
guessed you were behind my visit.

01:18:04.973 --> 01:18:07.643
You aren't in her good books,
if you know what I mean.

01:18:08.102 --> 01:18:09.430
You must see her again.

01:18:09.645 --> 01:18:11.768
Are you kidding?
Have you seen her secretary?

01:18:12.147 --> 01:18:13.772
Try the lunchbreak.

01:18:46.348 --> 01:18:48.756
Do you have a photocopy
machine back there?

01:18:50.227 --> 01:18:52.184
- May I use it?
- Or course.

01:21:51.784 --> 01:21:55.616
Hello, Baroness, it's me.
The wolf in sheep's clothing.

01:21:56.288 --> 01:22:00.155
I thought I'd made myself
quite clear, Mr. Corso.

01:22:02.252 --> 01:22:04.625
I've got something
for you, Baroness.

01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:08.415
A kind of peace offering. Will
you allow me to give it to you?

01:22:36.996 --> 01:22:38.704
First let me apologize.

01:22:38.998 --> 01:22:42.118
I should have told you right away
I work for Boris Balkan.

01:22:43.002 --> 01:22:46.952
I was foolish to think I could
deceive someone as astute as you.

01:22:47.173 --> 01:22:48.205
So please forgive me.

01:22:48.383 --> 01:22:51.419
Flattery will get you
nowhere, Mr. Corso.

01:22:52.303 --> 01:22:53.548
Get on with it.

01:22:57.267 --> 01:22:58.263
These...

01:23:00.395 --> 01:23:01.510
are for you.

01:23:04.274 --> 01:23:05.602
What is this?

01:23:06.234 --> 01:23:08.143
What is this supposed to be?

01:23:09.112 --> 01:23:12.279
You said your knowledge of
"The Nine Gates" was extensive,

01:23:12.532 --> 01:23:15.901
but did you ever compare
your copy with the other two?

01:23:17.704 --> 01:23:18.404
Why?

01:23:18.663 --> 01:23:20.205
Well, you should.

01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:23.292
These are copies of the
engravings in Balkan's book.

01:23:24.294 --> 01:23:26.666
You'll find that some of them
differ from yours.

01:23:29.174 --> 01:23:32.258
So you question my book's
authenticity, do you?

01:23:33.011 --> 01:23:35.584
If that's your peace offering,
you can take it and go.

01:23:35.972 --> 01:23:38.012
My "Nine Gates"
is absolutely genuine.

01:23:38.224 --> 01:23:39.968
I don't dispute that,
Baroness.

01:23:40.185 --> 01:23:42.972
In my opinion,
all three copies are genuine.

01:23:43.229 --> 01:23:45.602
But the fact remains,
they display variations.

01:23:45.815 --> 01:23:47.274
Variations?

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:51.314
If that were true,
it would be a revelation.

01:23:51.821 --> 01:23:53.197
What makes you so sure?

01:23:55.075 --> 01:23:56.320
I've already compared these

01:23:56.534 --> 01:23:58.194
with the Fargas's engravings.

01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:59.532
And in his book,

01:24:01.373 --> 01:24:04.290
the keys were
in the other hand...

01:24:05.502 --> 01:24:08.456
Here, the doorway
wasn't bricked up...

01:24:09.339 --> 01:24:11.378
And in this one
the man was hanging

01:24:11.591 --> 01:24:13.216
by the other leg.

01:24:29.901 --> 01:24:32.309
- Well?
- Well what?

01:24:35.490 --> 01:24:37.815
Look closely, Baroness.

01:24:39.285 --> 01:24:40.281
The turrets.

01:24:40.578 --> 01:24:44.078
Three in yours,
four in Balkan's.

01:24:56.302 --> 01:24:57.251
Amazing.

01:24:58.179 --> 01:25:01.097
I'm convinced there'll be
a third one in here somewhere.

01:25:01.891 --> 01:25:05.095
Three variations in
three copies makes nine.

01:25:05.645 --> 01:25:07.852
Coincidence,
or something more?

01:25:08.690 --> 01:25:12.735
Maybe Torchia hid the secret of the
Ninth Gate in three books, not one.

01:25:15.155 --> 01:25:17.278
I must admit I'm impressed.

01:25:17.490 --> 01:25:20.325
This puts an entirely different
complexion on the matter.

01:25:21.494 --> 01:25:25.195
You have my permission to
investigate further, Mr. Corso.

01:25:25.749 --> 01:25:27.788
Take as long as you need.

01:25:43.558 --> 01:25:47.093
My permission did not
extend to that, Mr. Corso.

01:25:48.438 --> 01:25:51.225
Nobody smokes in my library.

01:31:24.441 --> 01:31:27.228
Excuse me. There's something
missing from my room.

01:31:27.569 --> 01:31:30.902
- Has anyone been up there?
- Only your wife.

01:31:31.573 --> 01:31:33.400
My wife?
I don't have a wife!

01:31:35.702 --> 01:31:38.240
Yes, he's right
in front of me.

01:31:38.872 --> 01:31:39.821
All right.

01:31:40.081 --> 01:31:42.323
For you, monsieur. Cabin two.

01:31:48.715 --> 01:31:50.126
What news?

01:31:52.385 --> 01:31:53.381
News?

01:31:53.970 --> 01:31:56.129
Let me see... Well...

01:31:56.765 --> 01:32:00.845
Yes. The good news is I got
to examine the old woman's book

01:32:01.478 --> 01:32:03.803
and three of her engravings
were signed "LCF".

01:32:04.022 --> 01:32:06.809
The bad news is that
someone strangled her and

01:32:07.067 --> 01:32:10.186
made a bonfire of her collection.
Now that's tragic, wouldn't you say?

01:32:10.403 --> 01:32:12.443
You took the words
out of my mouth.

01:32:13.073 --> 01:32:16.157
Yes, it's the Fargas story
all over again.

01:32:16.368 --> 01:32:20.412
I think they tore out the engravings
before they torched the place.

01:32:20.789 --> 01:32:22.497
That makes two sets they've got.

01:32:22.665 --> 01:32:23.994
And my copy?

01:32:24.918 --> 01:32:27.705
Well, I learned my lesson,
fortunately.

01:32:27.921 --> 01:32:29.830
I don't carry it around
with me anymore.

01:32:30.048 --> 01:32:32.373
Otherwise, it might have
gone up in smoke.

01:32:32.592 --> 01:32:34.632
Excellent. Good thinking.

01:32:35.178 --> 01:32:39.010
Well, with two copies gone, that
seems to conclude your assignment.

01:32:39.224 --> 01:32:41.347
It only remains for you
to return my book.

01:32:41.559 --> 01:32:44.644
I'm staying at the Ritz, you can
pick up your check at the same time.

01:32:44.813 --> 01:32:46.473
Shall we say half an hour?

01:32:48.441 --> 01:32:50.434
There's more bad news.

01:32:52.570 --> 01:32:54.729
- I don't have it.
- You don't have it?

01:32:55.865 --> 01:32:57.941
Someone lifted it from my room.

01:33:02.288 --> 01:33:05.076
Listen to me very carefully,
Mr. Corso.

01:33:06.501 --> 01:33:08.992
I think you may already
have some idea

01:33:09.212 --> 01:33:12.795
of the lengths to which I'm prepared
to go when I want something.

01:33:14.175 --> 01:33:18.469
Unless you recover my property
in double-quick time,

01:33:19.639 --> 01:33:22.925
you'll discover just
how far that can be.

01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.694
Where is it?

01:33:35.864 --> 01:33:37.691
- Where's what?
- The book. Where is it?

01:33:38.742 --> 01:33:40.781
Would I be here
if I took it?

01:33:40.994 --> 01:33:42.654
You should know
better by now.

01:33:48.710 --> 01:33:51.379
I must apologize for my
young colleague, Mr. Corso. It was

01:33:51.588 --> 01:33:52.667
unpardonable.

01:33:53.423 --> 01:33:54.703
Is that her?

01:33:55.341 --> 01:33:59.553
No, monsieur. She was tall,
dark hair, very chic, very elegant.

01:33:59.763 --> 01:34:00.961
Which reminds me.
I have

01:34:01.181 --> 01:34:04.098
the information you wanted. The lady
and gentleman you mentioned,

01:34:04.517 --> 01:34:08.182
they're staying
at the Plaza Athena Hotel,

01:34:08.396 --> 01:34:11.148
suite 209-211.

01:34:12.442 --> 01:34:15.194
Thank you very much, Gruber. I owe
you one. I need a taxi, quick.

01:34:18.448 --> 01:34:22.398
Send this to Mr. Balkan at
the Ritz. That's B-A-L-K-A-N.

01:34:25.246 --> 01:34:26.195
Fax that immediately.

01:34:29.876 --> 01:34:32.034
Always a pleasure
to be of service.

01:34:32.295 --> 01:34:33.209
Coming?

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:55.357
What do you plan to do
if you see them?

01:34:55.652 --> 01:34:57.728
Probably hide behind you.

01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:53.576
Hold it right here. That's them.

01:35:56.421 --> 01:35:59.208
We should grab a taxi
before they take off.

01:36:19.402 --> 01:36:20.813
They're going.

01:36:54.437 --> 01:36:55.468
Coming?

01:37:07.450 --> 01:37:09.110
Couldn't you pick something
a little less conspicuous?

01:37:09.327 --> 01:37:10.905
Don't be so picky.

01:37:11.121 --> 01:37:13.528
Some people would give their
eyeteeth for a ride in this.

01:37:50.702 --> 01:37:53.703
We can't sit on their tail forever.
They're bound to smell a rat.

01:38:18.521 --> 01:38:19.719
How do I look?

01:38:21.858 --> 01:38:22.688
Ridiculous.

01:38:31.368 --> 01:38:32.566
Sit tight!

01:39:21.418 --> 01:39:22.532
Take your pick.

01:39:24.087 --> 01:39:26.329
No, you.
You know everything.

01:39:26.548 --> 01:39:27.746
If you say so.

01:39:42.063 --> 01:39:43.261
We lost them.

01:39:43.690 --> 01:39:45.350
No, not at this speed.

01:39:45.734 --> 01:39:47.144
They must have gone
the other way.

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:49.519
You mean I don't know
everything after all?

01:39:50.488 --> 01:39:51.817
Turn around.

01:40:05.503 --> 01:40:08.077
Thirtyish, brunette, dishy...

01:40:08.256 --> 01:40:11.127
- What was her name again?
- Telfer, Liana Telfer.

01:40:11.342 --> 01:40:12.920
No, her maiden name.

01:40:14.429 --> 01:40:16.338
- Saint-Martin.
- Look.

01:41:03.186 --> 01:41:03.850
We're looking for

01:41:04.062 --> 01:41:05.473
Mme. De Saint Martin's house.

01:41:05.980 --> 01:41:07.012
The chateau?

01:41:07.190 --> 01:41:08.435
Chateau, I knew it!

01:41:09.693 --> 01:41:10.558
Where is it?

01:41:10.777 --> 01:41:12.983
Take the highway,
behind the church.

01:41:31.923 --> 01:41:33.168
Keep going.

01:43:56.359 --> 01:43:57.225
See them anywhere?

01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:33.740
Sorry to intrude
on you like this.

01:45:33.957 --> 01:45:35.534
What are you doing here?

01:45:36.584 --> 01:45:39.040
Just dropped by to pick up
the book you stole from my room.

01:45:39.254 --> 01:45:42.457
- The book is mine!
- We've been through all this before.

01:45:43.007 --> 01:45:44.170
My husband

01:45:44.384 --> 01:45:46.791
gave it to me,
it wasn't his to sell.

01:45:47.011 --> 01:45:48.506
Maybe he sold it to get
back at you.

01:45:48.847 --> 01:45:50.045
Did he catch you
with that albino?

01:45:50.265 --> 01:45:51.344
How dare you!

01:45:52.517 --> 01:45:53.382
Keep an eye on her.

01:45:56.479 --> 01:45:57.144
Careful,

01:45:57.355 --> 01:45:58.137
she bites.

01:46:14.914 --> 01:46:17.121
Don't move,
either one of you.

01:46:18.626 --> 01:46:19.622
Get the book.

01:46:34.726 --> 01:46:35.924
Don't kill them up here,

01:46:36.144 --> 01:46:37.259
you'll make a mess.

01:46:37.771 --> 01:46:39.146
Take them downstairs.

01:46:40.440 --> 01:46:41.222
You go first.

01:46:42.067 --> 01:46:43.146
Then you.

01:46:56.081 --> 01:46:56.911
Down.

01:47:12.180 --> 01:47:13.378
Open the door.

01:47:26.653 --> 01:47:27.684
Watch out!

01:47:46.172 --> 01:47:47.880
I didn't know
you had it in you.

01:48:18.997 --> 01:48:22.117
You stay here and cover me,
I'm going down.

01:49:19.182 --> 01:49:21.424
Look around you, all of you!
What do you see?

01:49:22.227 --> 01:49:25.346
A bunch of buffoons
in fancy dress.

01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:27.475
You think
the Prince of Darkness

01:49:27.691 --> 01:49:29.564
would actually deign
to manifest himself

01:49:29.776 --> 01:49:33.109
before the likes of you?
He never has and he never will.

01:49:35.365 --> 01:49:36.824
You read from his book,

01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:40.284
but you have no conception
of its true power.

01:49:40.537 --> 01:49:42.825
I alone have grasped its secret.

01:49:43.039 --> 01:49:45.874
I alone have fathomed
the Master's great design.

01:49:46.084 --> 01:49:48.539
I alone am worthy to enjoy
the fruits

01:49:48.753 --> 01:49:52.502
of that discovery: Absolute power
to determine my own destiny.

01:49:53.466 --> 01:49:55.258
You're insane, Boris.
Give it back to me.

01:49:56.469 --> 01:49:59.007
As for you,
Liana de Saint-Martin,

01:49:59.222 --> 01:50:01.843
you're even guiltier than
the rest of this pathetic rabble.

01:50:02.392 --> 01:50:04.266
You have at least some idea

01:50:04.477 --> 01:50:06.553
of what this book can do
in the right hands,

01:50:06.771 --> 01:50:09.143
yet you lend yourself
to these farcical proceedings,

01:50:09.357 --> 01:50:11.564
these orgies of aging flesh

01:50:11.776 --> 01:50:14.446
conducted in the Master's name.
You're a charlatan!

01:50:53.485 --> 01:50:54.860
Let it be.

01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:30.183
What is it with you?

01:51:30.397 --> 01:51:33.647
He just murdered someone in public.
You're off the hook.

01:51:34.359 --> 01:51:36.648
For the other killings,
you should be grateful.

01:51:36.861 --> 01:51:37.810
I'm ecstatic.

01:51:38.029 --> 01:51:39.607
You're out of a job.

01:51:39.823 --> 01:51:41.614
- What more do you want?
- You know what.

01:52:09.144 --> 01:52:10.554
Not taking me for a ride?

01:52:10.895 --> 01:52:12.639
You were working for him
all along.

01:52:12.856 --> 01:52:14.979
Funny, I thought you were.

01:54:43.673 --> 01:54:45.749
They're dry now, sir.

01:54:51.765 --> 01:54:53.342
Where is this?

01:54:56.394 --> 01:54:58.719
Look, Bernard.
Can you show him?

01:57:14.074 --> 01:57:17.110
Yes. Yes, that's it,
precisely.

01:57:21.915 --> 01:57:23.907
All is in readiness.

01:57:25.210 --> 01:57:25.790
One,

01:57:27.045 --> 01:57:28.124
four,

01:57:29.255 --> 01:57:30.287
three,

01:57:30.590 --> 01:57:31.753
six,

01:57:32.342 --> 01:57:33.540
seven,

01:57:34.052 --> 01:57:35.332
five,

01:57:35.678 --> 01:57:38.845
eight, two, nine.

01:57:40.308 --> 01:57:42.597
The enigma is solved at last.

01:57:45.480 --> 01:57:48.730
"To travel in silence
by a long and circuitous route,

01:57:48.942 --> 01:57:53.355
to brave the arrows of misfortune,
and fear neither noose nor fire.

01:57:53.613 --> 01:57:55.689
To play the greatest
of all games

01:57:55.907 --> 01:57:58.196
and win, foregoing no expense,

01:57:58.410 --> 01:57:59.358
is to mock

01:57:59.577 --> 01:58:02.448
the vicissitudes of fate,
and gain at last the key,

01:58:02.872 --> 01:58:07.333
that will unlock
the Ninth Gate!"

01:58:14.676 --> 01:58:17.428
What were you expecting,
an apparition?

01:58:19.806 --> 01:58:22.379
You're not wanted here,
Mr. Corso. Leave.

01:58:24.227 --> 01:58:26.136
I'm the only apparition
you'll see tonight.

01:58:27.147 --> 01:58:30.266
You'll find a check waiting at my
New York office. Payment in full.

01:58:31.192 --> 01:58:34.146
You killed for those.
They're worth more than money.

01:58:34.362 --> 01:58:37.814
Infinitely more,
but they happen to be mine,

01:58:38.408 --> 01:58:39.688
not yours.

01:58:41.369 --> 01:58:43.243
You know something, Corso?

01:58:44.372 --> 01:58:46.164
Despite our differences,

01:58:46.958 --> 01:58:49.034
I have a soft spot for you.

01:58:49.669 --> 01:58:52.077
- I'm touched.
- We have something in common.

01:58:52.839 --> 01:58:57.548
We share the same passion. You've
developed the same obsession.

01:58:58.053 --> 01:59:01.386
Unfortunately for you only one
of us is destined to fulfill it.

01:59:01.598 --> 01:59:03.840
You're out of your depth,
kindly go.

01:59:05.393 --> 01:59:08.845
- I'm not leaving here empty handed.
- Don't even think about it.

01:59:10.523 --> 01:59:11.437
Stand aside.

01:59:12.942 --> 01:59:15.065
I credited you
with more finesse.

01:59:15.278 --> 01:59:17.650
- You heard me, stand back.
- Put that away, it's not your style.

01:59:41.012 --> 01:59:43.681
It seems you've found
your proper niche at last.

01:59:43.973 --> 01:59:44.969
I like that.

01:59:46.601 --> 01:59:47.632
Now,

01:59:49.062 --> 01:59:50.936
you can watch.

01:59:59.948 --> 02:00:02.237
I'm entering uncharted territory,

02:00:02.742 --> 02:00:07.369
taking the road that leads
to equality with God.

02:00:23.304 --> 02:00:26.756
You can't come with me,
I must travel alone.

02:00:26.975 --> 02:00:30.759
But you may look on
and marvel.

02:00:31.021 --> 02:00:34.057
- It's very kind of you.
- Indeed it is.

02:00:37.193 --> 02:00:40.147
There have been men
who have been burned alive

02:00:40.363 --> 02:00:43.613
or disemboweled
for just a glimpse

02:00:44.034 --> 02:00:48.327
of what you are
about to witness.

02:00:56.421 --> 02:00:58.663
I give you
my allegiance, Master.

02:00:59.090 --> 02:01:01.712
I pledge myself to you
body and soul.

02:01:01.926 --> 02:01:05.378
Let me fear neither noose,
nor fire, nor poison.

02:01:05.597 --> 02:01:09.725
Erase me from the Book of Life and
inscribe me in the Book of Death.

02:01:09.934 --> 02:01:13.138
Admit me to the Ninth Gate!

02:01:13.355 --> 02:01:14.765
Let it be so!

02:01:17.859 --> 02:01:20.564
Let it be so now!

02:01:35.251 --> 02:01:39.000
I can feel the power surge through
me like an electric current,

02:01:39.214 --> 02:01:41.621
rendering me capable
of any feat of mind

02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:42.755
or body.

02:01:42.967 --> 02:01:45.755
I'm invulnerable.
I'm invincible.

02:01:48.223 --> 02:01:52.007
I could float on air.
I can walk on water.

02:01:56.940 --> 02:02:00.024
Behold! I plunge my hands
into the fire.

02:02:00.402 --> 02:02:01.682
I feel no heat.

02:02:02.612 --> 02:02:04.486
That's just great,
give us another one.

02:02:25.593 --> 02:02:27.420
It's miraculous.

02:02:28.012 --> 02:02:30.717
I feel nothing,
nothing at all!

02:05:41.581 --> 02:05:42.744
Is that it?

02:05:44.167 --> 02:05:45.495
Is the game over?

02:05:46.127 --> 02:05:48.832
For Balkan yes,
not for you.

02:05:49.381 --> 02:05:50.791
Why didn't it work
for Balkan?

02:05:51.674 --> 02:05:53.050
The ninth engraving
was a forgery.

02:05:56.513 --> 02:05:57.758
Where's the real one?

02:06:00.141 --> 02:06:01.055
I want it.

02:06:04.312 --> 02:06:05.890
You're running low on gas.

02:07:52.128 --> 02:07:53.077
Do you speak English?
