00:10.041 --> 00:11.833
[thunder rumbles]

00:11.916 --> 00:13.041
[Byssrak growls]

00:15.250 --> 00:17.583
[thrilling music playing]

00:20.875 --> 00:22.000
War.

00:22.083 --> 00:27.500
Uldorak, Lirrak, now this
failed attack on you, Vahdrak.

00:27.583 --> 00:31.416
It is a message. A warning.

00:31.500 --> 00:36.125
Answer in blood, answer in fire.

00:36.208 --> 00:40.583
Terrorblade and his allies
strike at us in our sleep.

00:40.666 --> 00:45.791
-The thunder will answer.
-Perhaps a bargain before bloodshed.

00:45.875 --> 00:51.166
We do not bargain for our lives.
We attack the mouse in his tower.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.791
We reclaim what has been stolen.

00:53.875 --> 00:56.041
Retribution.

00:56.125 --> 00:59.916
"Retribution." "Bargains."

01:00.000 --> 01:05.208
What has been created,
at times, must be destroyed.

01:05.291 --> 01:11.166
What is destroyed
will rise and fall and rise again!

01:11.250 --> 01:16.166
All flailing arms, birth screams,

01:16.250 --> 01:18.750
and mother's blood.

01:19.958 --> 01:25.083
Too attached
to the flesh illusion you are.

01:25.166 --> 01:29.916
Too attached to the dream.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.375
I am the song that murders the world.

01:34.750 --> 01:41.041
[screaming]

01:44.791 --> 01:46.791
What fun.

01:53.166 --> 01:55.333
[mysterious music playing]

01:57.291 --> 02:03.708
The souls of your brothers.
Your sisters. Only one gift remains.

02:04.416 --> 02:09.291
It is no gift! It is my price!

02:09.375 --> 02:14.791
The fulfillment of my purpose
in the cycle of creation.

02:16.125 --> 02:17.750
Chaos!

02:18.583 --> 02:20.625
[mysterious music rises]

02:26.083 --> 02:29.125
[Vahdrak growls, screams]

02:36.875 --> 02:38.875
[theme music playing]

03:28.375 --> 03:31.416
[male elf] Those belong to us. Not to him.

03:32.208 --> 03:35.208
We defeat one usurper,
and now we serve another.

03:35.291 --> 03:38.291
We've lived without the power
of a living god for a millennium.

03:38.375 --> 03:43.250
We don't need lotuses or ley lines,
and we don't need any damn sorceress.

03:43.333 --> 03:45.291
The world belonged to us once,

03:45.375 --> 03:48.541
before Selemene betrayed us,
and the humans took it.

03:48.625 --> 03:51.208
All we need is steel
and courage to take it back.

03:51.958 --> 03:56.166
As our empire rises,
night and shadow fall.

03:58.625 --> 04:01.083
[fire crackling]

04:01.166 --> 04:03.583
[dragons screeching]

04:12.125 --> 04:13.083
[gasps]

04:36.500 --> 04:38.666
[humming in distance]

04:40.375 --> 04:41.500
I hear singing.

04:41.583 --> 04:46.583
The wind plays tricks.
These caverns are like a horn at times.

04:46.666 --> 04:50.541
Always beautiful, often unsettling.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.458
I didn't hear anything.

04:53.208 --> 04:55.333
Yeah. Just the wind.

04:56.833 --> 04:59.833
[grandiose music playing]

05:01.833 --> 05:03.833
This is quite a place you have.

05:04.416 --> 05:08.458
Lovely. Tasteful. Cold.
[sniffs]

05:08.541 --> 05:11.083
It's not my place. It's hers.

05:11.166 --> 05:15.125
-Oh, right. Sure. Total dragon hole.
-[Auroth groans]

05:15.208 --> 05:17.500
Auroth spotted the wyrmling swarm.

05:17.583 --> 05:21.708
When we saw the fire,
then you, we had to help.

05:22.416 --> 05:24.583
That's two you owe me.

05:24.666 --> 05:28.166
-We need rest. We need food.
-[humming in distance]

05:28.250 --> 05:30.666
Then we'll need supplies.

05:39.333 --> 05:40.708
-[gasps]
-[Fymryn] I know this look.

05:41.333 --> 05:44.375
I saw it on my mother's face
after her primary died.

05:44.458 --> 05:47.291
She would wander the forests
as though she might find her there.

05:47.375 --> 05:49.958
-I'm fine.
-Mother used to say that too.

05:50.041 --> 05:53.833
I just… The music seems like more
than simply the wind.

05:54.750 --> 05:58.125
Terrorblade. Did he… Did anyone…
Did they hurt you?

05:58.208 --> 05:59.916
I mean, you look okay, but--

06:00.000 --> 06:03.708
No one hurt me.
Not Terrorblade and not you.

06:04.375 --> 06:05.500
Never you.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.625
[somber music playing]

06:12.666 --> 06:17.625
"Or a frozen waste's eternal gazing,
ancient agonies survive.

06:17.708 --> 06:22.916
Thunder lost, lone voices praising,
one from many has derived."

06:23.000 --> 06:24.041
[Rylai] Do you like it?

06:24.125 --> 06:27.250
That's really good.
Or it's really terrible. I can't tell.

06:28.291 --> 06:29.125
[screams]

06:29.208 --> 06:31.291
-I wrote it.
-I, I love it?

06:31.375 --> 06:33.291
Am I supposed to answer for you?

06:33.375 --> 06:38.541
Um, sorry. It's just you talk. 'Course,
you talk. You write. I can't write.

06:38.625 --> 06:43.166
All that's necessary is for you to feel.
The words will follow.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.875
Feel. Right.

06:47.958 --> 06:49.791
[birds chirping]

06:56.958 --> 06:58.250
[door opens]

07:00.750 --> 07:02.000
Faith.

07:05.625 --> 07:07.833
[grandiose music playing]

07:20.500 --> 07:22.416
[Mirana] My grandfather's sword.

07:23.083 --> 07:25.666
He feared no one.
[grunts]

07:26.250 --> 07:27.541
[soldier] Your Highness, wait!

07:29.166 --> 07:30.125
Your Highness, please!

07:30.833 --> 07:32.458
[grunts]

07:34.000 --> 07:35.791
[gasps, grunts]

07:35.875 --> 07:38.583
Princess! Please! Stop!

07:42.416 --> 07:43.541
[Viceroy Kashurra] Sunbeam.

07:45.083 --> 07:47.708
[panting]

07:49.166 --> 07:50.291
[chuckles]

07:50.375 --> 07:52.166
-Sunbeam.
-[gasps]

07:53.250 --> 07:56.500
No need to run.
No one here would hurt you.

07:56.583 --> 07:58.166
No one here would dare.

07:59.750 --> 08:00.875
Welcome home.

08:02.375 --> 08:06.000
Viceroy Kashurra,
I am grateful for what you did for me.

08:06.083 --> 08:10.125
But you stayed here. You serve my uncle.

08:10.208 --> 08:14.250
I served the Helio Imperium
as your father demanded.

08:14.333 --> 08:16.375
The Imperium kidnapped me.

08:17.166 --> 08:20.125
The Emperor has his reasons.

08:20.208 --> 08:24.000
For now, try to enjoy
the hospitality I offer you.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.500
Safe, secure.

08:26.208 --> 08:28.500
No one harms my Sunbeam.

08:35.958 --> 08:39.416
[indistinct chatter]

08:39.500 --> 08:41.708
[suspenseful music playing]

08:49.750 --> 08:52.000
[chuckles]

08:52.791 --> 08:54.666
[grunts]

08:57.125 --> 08:59.375
[murmuring]

09:04.666 --> 09:07.416
Quite impressive with the Oglodi.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.458
Hm. I could watch you do that every day.
[chuckles]

09:11.166 --> 09:12.916
And I fear I will get my chance.

09:13.750 --> 09:17.291
This, uh, little game you play
always ends the same.

09:17.375 --> 09:20.708
You well sleep with
one of those pretty eyes open.

09:20.791 --> 09:24.666
Him? Jarl?
I've owed him that for 15 years.

09:25.750 --> 09:28.958
And get your tail out of my face
before I choke you with it.

09:30.291 --> 09:33.041
Mm. Promises, promises.

09:33.125 --> 09:36.375
At least I will die
staring into your eyes.

09:38.125 --> 09:41.125
Nico Hieronimo.
Formerly of the Nivan Gallants.

09:41.208 --> 09:44.000
Currently rotting in this shithole.

09:44.083 --> 09:47.333
Okay. I'll leave you to your sleep
or lack of it.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.833
[groans]
Pangoliers.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.541
[Kaden] We're safe here, for the moment.

09:53.625 --> 09:57.083
But those wyrmlings are still loose.
The demon's army now.

09:57.166 --> 10:01.333
Our first task is to reclaim
Dragon Hold and reclaim the Forge.

10:01.916 --> 10:04.375
We'll need steel for the battles to come.

10:04.458 --> 10:06.583
We recall our brothers
who remain in the field.

10:06.666 --> 10:08.791
We don't have time for any of that.

10:09.416 --> 10:13.583
I, I think what Davion means is,
you're right and we should do it quickly.

10:13.666 --> 10:15.750
That's not what I meant.

10:15.833 --> 10:20.208
You want to charge back into the fight.
Hunt the demon to his lair, take his head.

10:20.291 --> 10:21.375
Something like that.

10:21.958 --> 10:24.208
Don't let that thing
inside speak for you, son.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.000
Damn sure don't let it do your thinking.

10:26.083 --> 10:30.166
If Terrorblade gets to the Eldwyrms, those
monsters at Dragon Hold won't matter.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.458
-Nothing will.
-[bang on table]

10:31.541 --> 10:35.666
My whole life, I never imagined
I'd ever see you run from a fight.

10:38.458 --> 10:40.125
Should I go after him, or…

10:43.583 --> 10:47.500
[sighs]
I'll just sit here… with me.

10:47.583 --> 10:48.875
[sword swooshes]

10:48.958 --> 10:51.833
[Rylai] The little one told me
about your fight with Davion.

10:51.916 --> 10:55.958
-[Kaden] Wasn't a fight.
-He walked out. It was a fight.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.625
The boy saw things.

11:00.333 --> 11:01.625
[grunts]

11:01.708 --> 11:05.083
He saw things he wasn't prepared to see.

11:05.666 --> 11:09.083
The boy did. It's just like Leathsham.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.916
You never mourned, did you?
You disappeared into the hunt.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.083
And you're doing the same now.

11:16.166 --> 11:18.750
You lost them. You lost her.

11:19.416 --> 11:22.041
-We're at war.
-The Fathers are dead.

11:22.125 --> 11:26.208
Your brothers don't need tactics.
They need what's been lost.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.333
That boy…

11:30.666 --> 11:32.250
needs what he's lost.

11:34.458 --> 11:36.708
[humming in distance]

11:51.333 --> 11:53.541
[dramatic music playing]

11:55.625 --> 11:57.041
[murmuring]

12:14.041 --> 12:18.041
Davion? Davion, please wake up.
I came looking for you.

12:18.125 --> 12:21.541
I found you in there, standing
in front of that blue rock. Just staring.

12:22.375 --> 12:28.041
He spoke to me. The music.
It was him. I heard Slyrak.

12:29.333 --> 12:35.041
You found my hoard.
The Ore calls to you as it once called me.

12:35.125 --> 12:40.958
Lifetimes ago, I took it as a treasure.
Kept it close, unaware of its power.

12:41.041 --> 12:45.708
I was just a simple dragon, you see.
Then I began to wake from my slumber

12:45.791 --> 12:50.541
with dreams of humans
not fighting but conversing.

12:51.208 --> 12:54.833
In time, my Eldwyrm's voice faded.

12:54.916 --> 12:59.791
I collected books, began writing verse.
The dragon songs never returned.

13:00.625 --> 13:05.083
But in my solitude,
I had the most wonderful thought.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.041
I am.

13:07.625 --> 13:10.291
And it was this Ore that changed you?

13:10.375 --> 13:15.291
Some say the Ore and its crimson
opposite are the stuff of gods and demons.

13:15.375 --> 13:20.791
Others believe them to be remnants
of a vast and timeless primordial mind.

13:20.875 --> 13:25.625
I know only that they are dangerous.

13:26.208 --> 13:30.875
But it called to me in Slyrak's voice.
Slyrak's song.

13:30.958 --> 13:33.583
Whatever it was, it was part of you.

13:33.666 --> 13:38.708
Return to the hoard. Stand in the light.
And be forever changed.

13:38.791 --> 13:44.708
The question is not "What are they?"
The question is "What are you?"

13:46.458 --> 13:48.458
[pensive music playing]

13:56.250 --> 13:57.375
[sighs]

14:03.083 --> 14:05.166
[dreamy music playing]

14:11.750 --> 14:14.166
[somber music playing]

14:24.416 --> 14:25.750
Mother.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.250
[footsteps approaching]

14:46.916 --> 14:47.833
[door closes]

14:48.750 --> 14:50.916
[solemn music]

14:52.500 --> 14:54.916
Forgive the informality, Princess.

14:55.000 --> 14:59.041
It's no reflection of the throne's esteem,
merely security measure.

14:59.875 --> 15:03.166
-Uncle.
-Leave us. Everyone.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.125
Everyone but you.

15:07.041 --> 15:10.000
Time to come down of the throne
and talk business.

15:10.083 --> 15:15.125
Your father loved the "thees" and "thous."
But that never really my style.

15:15.208 --> 15:21.041
This is a terrible job. Even for God.
Everyone in the Imperium want something.

15:21.125 --> 15:24.250
Usually, it's something
someone else has and wants to keep.

15:24.333 --> 15:27.083
There's nothing new about it.
It's the way of things.

15:27.166 --> 15:30.041
Your parents knew this. Kashurra knows it.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.500
You can't change it.
Not for good, not forever.

15:33.583 --> 15:37.333
The only thing you can do is manage it.
Which is where I come in.

15:37.916 --> 15:40.500
I am the arbiter of banal ambition.

15:40.583 --> 15:43.166
My heart swells with pity for you.

15:43.750 --> 15:48.666
The people need things to believe in,
which is where you come in.

15:48.750 --> 15:53.875
The prodigal daughter returned
on the arm of the Emperor, his queen.

15:54.666 --> 15:56.125
That's not what I mean.

15:56.208 --> 16:00.833
This is business.
I'm after an idea, a story.

16:00.916 --> 16:04.666
The kind of story the people
and great houses can rally behind.

16:04.750 --> 16:06.041
No, you chose that chair.

16:06.125 --> 16:10.291
You murdered my parents for it.
To hell with you and your story.

16:10.375 --> 16:13.708
[Uncle Shabarra] Things are happening
in the world, Princess.

16:13.791 --> 16:18.916
The Coriel'Tauvi are on the move.
Converging on the Nightsilver Woods.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.833
Refugees flock from skirmishes
on the enclave borders.

16:22.916 --> 16:27.166
They say the Dark Moon Order
was destroyed by a 12-foot demon.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.541
No idea if that's true, but damn!

16:30.125 --> 16:35.166
Noise, chaos, threats.
The Imperium needs unity.

16:35.250 --> 16:38.208
The people need the Princess of the Sun.

16:38.750 --> 16:43.083
The people need you.
Don't say a word. Sleep on it.

16:47.125 --> 16:49.416
The arrogance of that man!

16:49.500 --> 16:52.500
[Viceroy Kashurra]
Yet it disguises his insecurity.

16:52.583 --> 16:58.333
The Emperor harbors concerns over war,
but not from without, but from within.

16:59.041 --> 17:03.208
Factions that emerged after
your father's death never reconciled.

17:03.291 --> 17:06.333
His loyalists complicate Shabarra's rule.

17:06.416 --> 17:10.625
Opportunistic others exploit
the conflict to their advantage.

17:11.208 --> 17:13.291
Yeah, my uncle needs legitimacy.

17:13.375 --> 17:16.958
Yes, he has a need.
And you have the power to meet it.

17:17.041 --> 17:19.500
[scoffs]
I'd rather die in the stockade!

17:19.583 --> 17:21.458
I would rather you not.

17:21.541 --> 17:25.125
Your family still has friends here.
We will get you to safety.

17:25.208 --> 17:27.750
-And Luna?
-Luna is a public enemy.

17:27.833 --> 17:30.125
You will lose what friends you have left.

17:30.208 --> 17:35.541
I won't leave her to rot and die.
I'll just have to find another way.

17:36.250 --> 17:38.250
[Luna groans, breathes heavily]

17:41.250 --> 17:42.333
[sucks teeth]

17:42.416 --> 17:43.250
[door opens]

17:43.833 --> 17:48.666
Fifteen years and a punch in the face.
Well, that's a fine hello.

17:48.750 --> 17:53.125
Plenty of friends here.
Got you to thank for their accommodations.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.125
They wonder where you went
that day on the battlefield.

17:57.791 --> 18:02.541
They wonder why you never came back.
I don't wonder.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.458
I don't care.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.666
-[grunts]
-[groans]

18:07.541 --> 18:09.333
[grunts, groans]

18:13.041 --> 18:14.541
[groaning]

18:22.916 --> 18:24.041
[grunts]

18:25.166 --> 18:26.458
-[chuckles]
-[coughs]

18:27.750 --> 18:29.833
-Madam.
-[groans]

18:30.833 --> 18:31.833
[gasps]

18:32.625 --> 18:33.791
[grunts]

18:33.875 --> 18:38.625
I'm putting a new company together.
Are you in or out?

18:45.250 --> 18:47.250
[Auroth] I think you're very interesting.

18:47.833 --> 18:49.333
Ah. Thanks.

18:49.416 --> 18:53.416
You're a Dragon Knight,
but quite unlike the others.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.375
Ha! "Dragon Knight." Right.

18:56.458 --> 18:59.500
This sword? Not exactly
the hand-me-down that I wanted.

18:59.583 --> 19:03.208
The knight who owned this,
he was kind of an asshole, really.

19:03.291 --> 19:08.583
Wanted his boots shined daily.
But he, he died, a knight's death.

19:09.291 --> 19:10.833
I'm no Dragon Knight.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.416
I'm just an asshole
carrying another asshole's sword.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.125
I'm a bit player in someone else's story.

19:16.208 --> 19:20.708
You are only as important to the story
as you choose to be.

19:20.791 --> 19:22.500
Wait here.

19:23.458 --> 19:25.416
[footsteps approaching]

19:25.500 --> 19:28.041
I brought you a gift.
I hope you like gifts.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.916
-[growls]
-Stop doing that!

19:31.541 --> 19:33.416
-A ring?
-[Auroth] A weapon.

19:33.500 --> 19:38.250
Every great hero needs a weapon.
This ring can be yours.

19:39.291 --> 19:41.791
[Bram] Am I invisible? I'm invisible!

19:42.500 --> 19:44.958
I can see me. But maybe
I'm supposed to be able to see me.

19:45.041 --> 19:46.041
[growls]

19:47.708 --> 19:48.708
[gasps]

19:51.333 --> 19:52.166
[groans]

19:57.500 --> 19:59.291
Now hit me.

19:59.375 --> 20:01.958
-With what?
-[Auroth] Anything.

20:02.041 --> 20:02.875
Uh…

20:04.458 --> 20:05.458
[grunts]

20:06.625 --> 20:08.625
[groans]

20:10.625 --> 20:16.166
I am defeated.
This victory is yours, Dragon Knight.

20:19.333 --> 20:21.666
You're afraid. Don't be.

20:21.750 --> 20:25.250
[exhales deeply]
Trust me, it's a new experience.

20:25.958 --> 20:31.458
It's like I'm two people.
Davion the Dragon Knight, and I'm him.

20:32.208 --> 20:35.333
And for the longest time,
I thought I was just Davion,

20:35.416 --> 20:37.958
who sometimes became the other thing.

20:38.041 --> 20:41.375
But what if I have it wrong?
What if I have it backwards?

20:41.458 --> 20:43.083
We're all two people.

20:43.166 --> 20:46.208
The priests teach Mene is more
than Goddess of the Moon.

20:46.291 --> 20:49.333
She is the Goddess of Night.
The Goddess of Shadow.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.666
There can be no shadow
without a light to cast it.

20:52.958 --> 20:55.083
Walk in shadow, know the light.

20:55.875 --> 20:58.500
Walk in shadow, know the light.

21:07.250 --> 21:08.875
The burning truth!

21:10.583 --> 21:17.041
Little mouse!
We finally meet beyond the void!

21:17.125 --> 21:20.791
-The Eldwyrms. They told me…
-[Slyrak] The pillars have fallen.

21:21.458 --> 21:28.166
Their souls captured.
You alone remain. A piece of me.

21:28.666 --> 21:32.041
The only chance, Ember Mouse, burn them.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.541
-Burn them all!
-I'm not you!

21:34.625 --> 21:38.416
We are me. Do you not understand?

21:38.500 --> 21:42.000
I am in your blood as you are in mine.

21:42.083 --> 21:46.625
It has always been so.
It is why you were chosen.

21:49.166 --> 21:51.166
[Davion] Just tell me how to end this.

21:51.250 --> 21:56.625
[Slyrak] Only with the Eye,
can we see into Foulfell.

21:56.708 --> 22:00.541
Only then, can I kill Terrorblade.

22:00.625 --> 22:02.958
You're not making any sense.

22:03.041 --> 22:07.458
I have sung you the truth
since the beginning.

22:08.041 --> 22:10.125
Yet you do not hear me.

22:10.208 --> 22:14.208
I couldn't. Sing it to me again
while I'm listening.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.958
The Solar God's relic.

22:17.041 --> 22:21.625
Find the Eye of the Worldwyrm!

22:24.625 --> 22:26.750
[gasps]
The Eldwyrms are dead.

22:27.250 --> 22:28.375
What about you?

22:29.000 --> 22:30.416
I know what I am.
[sighs]

22:34.500 --> 22:36.416
That's all the bastard said?

22:36.500 --> 22:39.500
Nonsense about the Solar God
and the Eye of the Worldwyrm?

22:39.583 --> 22:40.916
I wish I knew where to start.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.250
Perhaps I do.
The place I came from many years ago.

22:44.333 --> 22:48.250
The Solar God makes his home there.
The Helio Imperium.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.000
The Helio Imperium?

22:51.541 --> 22:52.833
[Davion gasps]
Mirana.

22:53.791 --> 22:55.583
[Viceroy Kashurra] Dawn.

22:55.666 --> 23:00.416
It could be nowhere more beautiful
than the domain of the Solar Throne.

23:00.500 --> 23:04.250
It seems somehow
brighter today with you in it.

23:04.333 --> 23:07.041
I hope you sent for me
because you found your way

23:07.125 --> 23:08.375
as I knew you would.

23:09.083 --> 23:13.708
Because you plan to stay,
uh, but on your own terms.

23:14.375 --> 23:17.541
There is so much
of your father in you, Sunbeam.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.250
More than you know.

23:19.750 --> 23:22.250
[Mirana] Tell the Emperor
I've slept on it.

23:22.333 --> 23:26.541
Tell him I accept his proposal.

23:28.041 --> 23:30.041
[closing theme music playing]
