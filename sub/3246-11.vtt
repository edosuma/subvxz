00:10.594 --> 00:12.141
- Morning, love.
- Morning.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.905
- Hiya!
- All right.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.639
Maeve? You okay?

00:52.928 --> 00:55.101
No, love, I'm not.

00:55.180 --> 00:58.104
- You want me to call a doctor?
- Doctor can't help.

00:58.976 --> 01:03.152
Can't you... Can't you feel it, Trish?

01:03.230 --> 01:05.028
Can't feel anything.

01:05.732 --> 01:10.909
Boys! Get indoors! Get inside!
Get 'em inside!

01:10.988 --> 01:12.661
What's up with you?
They ain't done nothing wrong.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.616
It's happening again!

01:17.077 --> 01:20.001
♪ ...sits in the old gum tree

01:20.372 --> 01:24.502
♪ Merry merry king of the bush is he

01:24.585 --> 01:28.761
♪ Laugh, kookaburra, laugh, kookaburra

01:28.839 --> 01:31.888
♪ Gay your life must be ♪

01:37.973 --> 01:40.396
- They're not safe.
- They're in the garden.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.191
That's what it likes.
It likes it when they're playing.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.238
Get 'em in, I'm begging you!

01:45.355 --> 01:49.781
♪ Merry merry king of the bush is he

01:50.360 --> 01:55.116
♪ Laugh, kookaburra, laugh, kookaburra

01:55.198 --> 01:58.202
♪ Gay your life must be ♪

01:58.327 --> 02:02.548
Right, I've got my beady eyes on them.
Come on, come on.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.211
- No!
- Tom?

02:07.586 --> 02:10.134
- What are you?
- Where's he gone?

02:10.213 --> 02:13.262
What do you want
with our children?

03:06.603 --> 03:07.775
Ah.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.743
Ah!

03:28.625 --> 03:30.593
So, near future, yeah?

03:31.294 --> 03:34.218
I had a passing fancy.
Only, it didn't pass, it stopped.

03:35.924 --> 03:39.974
- 30th Olympiad.
- No way! Why didn't I think of this?

03:40.095 --> 03:41.472
That's great. Aw!

03:41.638 --> 03:42.935
Only seems like yesterday

03:43.014 --> 03:46.109
a few naked Greek blokes
were tossing a discus about,

03:46.226 --> 03:49.446
wrestling with each other in the sand,
as the crowds stood around baying...

03:49.521 --> 03:51.819
No, wait a minute, that was Club Med.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.201
Just in time
for the opening doodah ceremony tonight.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.575
I thought you'd like that.
Last one they had in London was dynamite.

03:57.654 --> 03:58.871
Wembley, 1948.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.208
I loved it so much I went back
and watched it all over again.

04:01.324 --> 04:06.751
Fella carrying a torch. Lovely chap.
What was his... Mark? John, Mark?

04:06.830 --> 04:08.082
Legs like pipe-cleaners,

04:08.165 --> 04:09.382
- but strong as a whippet...
- Doctor...

04:09.499 --> 04:11.660
And in those days,
everyone had a tea party to go to...

04:11.668 --> 04:13.170
- Doctor!
- You ever have those little cakes

04:13.253 --> 04:15.756
- with the crunchy ball bearings on top?
- You should really look at this!

04:15.839 --> 04:17.136
You know those things?

04:17.214 --> 04:18.637
Nobody else in this entire galaxy

04:18.716 --> 04:21.971
has ever even bothered
to make edible ball bearings. Genius!

04:23.680 --> 04:25.774
Who's taken them, do you think?

04:29.144 --> 04:32.273
Snatching children from a thoroughly
ordinary street like this.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.818
And why is it so cold?

04:36.526 --> 04:38.528
Someone reducing the temperature?

04:38.862 --> 04:41.081
Says here he went missing
this week.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.120
Why would a person
do something like this?

04:46.203 --> 04:47.625
What makes you think it's a person?

04:49.873 --> 04:53.343
Whatever it is,
it's got the whole street scared to death.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.009
Doctor, what...

05:25.492 --> 05:29.463
There you go. Fifth today.
That's not natural, is it?

05:29.538 --> 05:32.166
Dunno what happened.
I had it serviced less than a month ago.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.092
Nah, don't even try and explain it, mate.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.386
All the cars are doing it,
and you know what?

05:36.461 --> 05:39.180
It's bonkers. Bonkers.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.595
Come on then, pal, I'll help you shift it.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.599
Quicker you're on your way,
happier you'll be.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.190
There we go.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.944
- Do you want a hand?
- No, we're all right, love.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.109
Well, you're not.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.073
I'm tougher than I look. Honest.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.243
- Does this happen a lot?
- Cheers, mate!

06:08.034 --> 06:09.786
Been doing it all week.

06:09.953 --> 06:13.048
Since those children started going missing?

06:13.123 --> 06:15.626
Yeah. Suppose so.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.966
Hmm. Tickles.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.640
What's your game?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.559
My... Um...

06:28.305 --> 06:32.105
Snakes and ladders.
Quite good at squash, reasonable...

06:32.642 --> 06:35.646
I'm being facetious, aren't I?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.481
There's no call for it.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.108
Every car cuts out.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.484
Council are going nuts.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.161
I mean, they've given this
street the works. Renamed it.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.155
I've been tarmacking every pothole.

06:45.322 --> 06:47.416
Look at that. Beauty, innit?

06:47.490 --> 06:48.616
Yep.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.954
And all this is because that Olympic torch
comes right by the end of this close.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.334
Just down there.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.840
Everything's gotta be perfect, ain't it?

06:56.041 --> 06:59.261
- Only it ain't.
- It takes 'em when they're playing.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.639
- What takes them?
- Danny, Jane, Dale,

07:02.714 --> 07:04.466
- snatched in the blink of an eye.
- Liar! You're a liar!

07:04.549 --> 07:06.096
I am a... I'm a... Police officer!

07:06.176 --> 07:09.771
That's what I am.
I've got a badge and a police car.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.769
You don't have to get... I can prove it.
Just hold on...

07:11.848 --> 07:13.270
We've had plenty of coppers
poking round here,

07:13.350 --> 07:15.110
and you don't look or
sound like any of 'em.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.153
See? Look, I got a colleague! Lewis.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.821
Well, she looks less
like a copper than you do.

07:18.897 --> 07:20.194
Training. New recruit.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.696
It was either that or hairdressing.
So... Voilà!

07:23.401 --> 07:27.281
- What are you going to do?
- The police have knocked on every door.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.583
No clues, no leads, nothing!

07:29.658 --> 07:31.459
Look, look, kids run off sometimes,
all right?

07:31.534 --> 07:34.287
- That's what they do.
- I saw it with me own eyes.

07:34.371 --> 07:38.217
Dale Hicks in your garden
playing with your Tommy, and then...

07:39.042 --> 07:42.842
Right in front of me,
like he was never there.

07:42.921 --> 07:45.595
There's no need
to look any further than this street.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.472
It's right here amongst us!

07:47.550 --> 07:49.973
- Why don't we...
- Why don't we start with him!

07:50.053 --> 07:52.977
There's been all sorts like him
in this street, day and night...

07:53.056 --> 07:54.649
Fixing things up for the Olympics!

07:54.724 --> 07:56.192
Yeah, and taking
an awful long time about it!

07:56.267 --> 07:58.019
I'm of the opinion
that all we've gotta do is...

07:58.103 --> 07:59.195
That woman who just said... That's slander!

07:59.270 --> 08:00.487
I don't care what it is!

08:00.563 --> 08:01.655
I think we need to just...

08:01.731 --> 08:04.655
- I want an apology off her!
- Stop picking on him!

08:04.734 --> 08:08.204
- Yeah! Stop picking on me!
- And stop pretending to be blind!

08:08.279 --> 08:10.281
- It's evil!
- I don't believe in evil.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.038
Oh, no! You just believe in tarmackers

08:12.117 --> 08:13.869
with sack-loads of kidnapped kiddies
in their van.

08:13.952 --> 08:16.546
- Hey, hey, that's not what she's saying!
- Would you stop ganging up on me?

08:16.621 --> 08:18.089
Feeling guilty, are we?

08:18.164 --> 08:20.292
Fingers on lips!

08:29.884 --> 08:33.263
In the last six days,
three of your children have been stolen,

08:34.139 --> 08:36.140
snatched out of thin air, right?

08:38.268 --> 08:40.236
Uh... Can I...

08:42.105 --> 08:43.698
Look around you.

08:44.149 --> 08:47.244
This was a safe street till it came.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.412
It's not a person.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.907
I'll say it if no one else will.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.496
Maybe you're coppers, maybe you're not.

08:54.617 --> 08:59.168
I don't care who you are.
Can you please help us?

09:21.311 --> 09:23.188
- Want a hanky?
- You smell it?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.566
What's it remind you of?

09:26.649 --> 09:28.572
Sort of metal?

09:28.651 --> 09:30.153
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh!

09:33.114 --> 09:36.493
Danny Edwards cycled in one end
but never came out the other.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.749
Whoa! There it goes again.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.673
Look at the hairs on the back
of my manly hairy hand.

09:41.790 --> 09:47.468
And there's that smell.
It's like a burnt fuse plug or something.

09:47.879 --> 09:51.179
There's a residual energy in the spots
where the kids vanished.

09:51.257 --> 09:55.262
Whatever it was,
it used an awful lot of power to do this.

10:04.187 --> 10:07.316
- You have to come down sometime, Chloe.
- I'm busy, Mum.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.652
Look at it in here.

10:10.735 --> 10:14.456
Must've used up half a rainforest.
That's Dale.

10:17.450 --> 10:21.330
- Why did you draw him so sad?
- I didn't draw him like that.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.917
Dale made himself sad,

10:26.042 --> 10:27.919
so I'm gonna draw him a friend.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.721
That's what he needs, more friends.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.770
Have you seen the TV?

10:37.178 --> 10:40.182
Look, this'll cheer you up.
The torch is getting close.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.354
It'll pass right by our street.

10:42.433 --> 10:45.107
And tonight they'll light the Olympic flame
in the stadium,

10:45.228 --> 10:47.356
and the whole world
will be looking at our city.

10:47.438 --> 10:49.031
They’re lining the street...

10:49.107 --> 10:51.826
I mean, doesn't that make you feel
part of something?

10:51.901 --> 10:52.993
Sweetheart?

10:53.069 --> 10:55.822
We've seen the Prime Minister,
we've seen members of the Royal family...

10:55.905 --> 10:57.657
- Chloe?
- I'm busy, Mum.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.260
- Okay.
- ...as young Danny Fairweather

10:59.325 --> 11:02.829
carries the torch past them
on this wonderful summer's day.

11:02.912 --> 11:06.291
Very fitting. We've seen lots
of our sporting royalty, too...

11:06.416 --> 11:10.387
You're tired, Chloe.
I heard you calling out again last night.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.759
- It's fine.
- Nightmares?

11:12.839 --> 11:14.056
I'm drawing.

11:14.132 --> 11:15.679
Let me remind you
where the torches come from...

11:15.758 --> 11:16.850
Whatever they are...

11:16.926 --> 11:18.086
journey from the temple of...

11:18.136 --> 11:20.685
they're just dreams. You do know that?

11:21.931 --> 11:24.184
- They can't hurt you.
- I'm busy.

11:24.267 --> 11:27.612
Unless you want me to draw you,

11:27.729 --> 11:28.776
Mum.

11:30.273 --> 11:33.948
If you wanna stay cooped up in here, fine.
I'll leave you to it.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.913
- Oh, aren't you a beautiful boy!
- Thanks!

11:40.992 --> 11:43.040
I'm experimenting with backcombing. Oh.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.621
I used to have one like you.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.046
What?

11:49.792 --> 11:52.170
No, I'm not really a cat person.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.764
Once you've been threatened by one
in a nun's wimple,

11:54.839 --> 11:56.307
kind of takes the joy out of it.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.093
Come here, puss.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.306
What do you wanna go in there for?

12:15.693 --> 12:16.819
Doctor.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.159
Whoa!

12:26.162 --> 12:28.256
Ion residue. Blimey!

12:29.499 --> 12:30.591
That takes some doing.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.667
Just to snatch
a living organism out of space-time.

12:32.669 --> 12:35.764
This baby is just like,
"I'm having some of that!" I'm impressed.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.260
So the cat's been transported?

12:37.340 --> 12:39.968
It can harness huge reserves
of ionic power.

12:40.385 --> 12:42.934
We need to find the source of that power.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.394
Find the source and you will find

12:45.473 --> 12:48.522
whatever has taken to stealing children
and fluffy animals.

12:48.601 --> 12:51.571
See what you can see.
Keep 'em peeled, Lewis.

12:53.356 --> 12:56.030
I've given you friends, and you still moan.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.283
Moan, moan, moan. You're lucky.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.616
You're all together.
You don't know what it is to be alone.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.376
If you did, you'd be thanking me.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.170
No!

13:38.901 --> 13:40.869
That you, puss cat? You trapped?

13:50.121 --> 13:53.591
Not gonna open it, not gonna open it.
Not gonna open it...

14:16.272 --> 14:17.615
Stay still!

14:22.612 --> 14:23.989
Okey dokey?

14:25.031 --> 14:28.160
- Yeah. Cheers.
- No probs.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.001
I'll give you a fiver if you can tell me
what the hell it is.

14:33.081 --> 14:35.379
'Cause I haven't got the foggiest.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.803
- Well, I can tell you you just killed it.
- It was never living.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.380
It's animated by energy.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.509
The same energy that's snatching people.
That is so dinky!

14:43.591 --> 14:46.265
The go-anywhere creature.
Fits in your pocket.

14:46.344 --> 14:49.063
Makes friends, impresses the boss,
breaks the ice at parties.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.184
Oh. Hi-oh. Here we go.
Let's have a look.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.152
- Get out of here!
- What's it say?

15:04.987 --> 15:06.204
It is.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.991
It's graphite.

15:09.158 --> 15:12.162
Basically, the same material
as an HB pencil.

15:12.286 --> 15:16.166
- I was attacked by a pencil scribble?
- A scribble creature.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.377
Brought into being with ionic energy.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.720
Whatever we're dealing with,
it can create things as well as take them.

15:21.796 --> 15:24.640
But why make a scribble creature?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.517
Maybe it was a mistake.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.845
I mean, you scribble over something
when you wanna get rid of it,

15:28.928 --> 15:32.057
like a drawing. Like a...

15:33.349 --> 15:35.477
child's drawing.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.189
- He said it was in the street.
- Probably.

15:39.355 --> 15:41.699
- The girl.
- Of course! What girl?

15:41.774 --> 15:43.822
Something about her gave me the creeps.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.120
Even her own mum looked scared of her.

15:46.195 --> 15:49.699
- Are you deducting?
- I think I am.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.376
- Copper's hunch?
- Permission to follow it up, Sarge.

16:06.883 --> 16:10.353
Hello. I'm the Doctor and this is Rose.
Can we see your daughter?

16:10.428 --> 16:13.227
- No. You can't.
- Okay. Bye.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.148
Why? Why do you want to see Chloe?

16:18.478 --> 16:20.480
Well, there's some interesting stuff
going on in this street,

16:20.563 --> 16:21.735
and I just thought...

16:21.814 --> 16:24.863
Well, we thought that she might like
to give us a hand.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.195
- Sorry to bother you.
- Yeah. Sorry.

16:27.278 --> 16:30.908
We'll let you get on with things.
On your own. Bye again.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.410
Wait.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.794
Can you help her?

16:39.749 --> 16:40.921
Yes, I can.

16:41.042 --> 16:45.218
The torchbearer
is running up towards the Mall...

16:45.296 --> 16:47.799
She stays in her room most of the time.

16:47.882 --> 16:51.932
I try talking to her, but it's like
trying to speak to a brick wall.

16:53.471 --> 16:56.099
She gives me nothing,
just asks to be left alone.

16:57.183 --> 17:00.027
What about Chloe's dad?

17:00.102 --> 17:03.402
- Chloe's dad died a year ago.
- I'm sorry.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.907
You wouldn't be if you'd known him.

17:06.483 --> 17:08.452
Well, let's go and say hi.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.164
I should check on her first,
she might be asleep.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.117
Why are you afraid of her, Trish?

17:17.118 --> 17:20.419
I want you to know, before you see her,
that she's really a great kid.

17:20.498 --> 17:21.624
I'm sure she is.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.799
Yeah.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.969
She's never been in trouble at school.

17:25.086 --> 17:27.305
You should see her report from last year.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.723
A's and B's.

17:31.092 --> 17:32.765
Can I use your loo?

17:37.974 --> 17:40.568
She's in the choir.

17:40.643 --> 17:44.568
She sings in an old folks' home.
Any mum would be proud, you know?

17:44.814 --> 17:48.318
I want you to know these things
before you see her, Doctor,

17:48.401 --> 17:50.495
because right now, she's not herself.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.525
All right there?

19:07.563 --> 19:09.565
I'm the Doctor.

19:10.441 --> 19:11.658
I'm Chloe Webber.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.078
- How you doing, Chloe Webber?
- I'm busy.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.621
I'm making something.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.323
Aren't I, Mum?

19:17.406 --> 19:19.909
And like I said, she's not been sleeping...

19:20.076 --> 19:21.828
But you've been drawing, though.

19:22.328 --> 19:25.878
I'm rubbish. Stickmen about my limit.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.253
I can do this, though.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.919
Can you do that?

19:31.212 --> 19:33.510
- They don't stop moaning.
- Chloe...

19:33.589 --> 19:36.889
I try to help them,
but they don't stop moaning.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.348
Who don't?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.850
- We can be together.
- Sweetheart...

19:40.930 --> 19:42.398
Don't touch me, Mum.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.971
I'm coming...

20:18.050 --> 20:20.394
I'm busy, Doctor.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.097
Come on, Chloe, don't be a spoilsport.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.648
What's the big project?

20:25.349 --> 20:28.353
I'm dying to know.
What you making up there?

20:28.477 --> 20:29.729
Doctor!

20:32.565 --> 20:35.284
I'm coming to hurt you...

20:37.278 --> 20:39.326
- Look at it.
- No, ta.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.204
- What the hell was that?
- Drawing. Face of a man...

20:42.324 --> 20:44.122
- What face?
- Best not.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.623
What have you been drawing?

20:45.703 --> 20:47.876
- I drew him yesterday.
- Who?

20:47.997 --> 20:50.170
- Dad.
- Your dad?

20:50.291 --> 20:52.214
But he's long gone.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.555
Chloe, with all the lovely things
in the world, why him?

20:55.629 --> 20:58.052
I dream about him staring at me.

20:58.132 --> 21:00.385
I thought we were putting him behind us.

21:00.468 --> 21:02.186
What's the matter with you?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.764
- We need to stay together.
- Yes, we do.

21:04.847 --> 21:07.771
No, not you. Us.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.529
We need to stay together,
and then it'll be all right.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.279
Trish, the drawings,

21:15.357 --> 21:17.109
have you seen
what Chloe's drawings can do?

21:17.193 --> 21:18.866
Who gave you permission
to come into her room?

21:18.986 --> 21:20.408
Get out of my house.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.890
Tell us about the drawings, Chloe.

21:21.989 --> 21:23.206
I don't want to hear any more of this.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.829
But that drawing of her dad...

21:24.909 --> 21:27.253
- I heard a voice, he spoke.
- He's dead.

21:27.328 --> 21:29.205
And these? They're kid's pictures.
Now get out!

21:29.288 --> 21:30.710
Chloe has a power.

21:30.790 --> 21:34.294
And I don't know how,
but she used it to take Danny Edwards,

21:34.376 --> 21:36.629
Dale Hicks.
She's using it to snatch the kids.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.714
- Get out.
- Have you seen those drawings move?

21:38.798 --> 21:41.221
- I haven't seen anything.
- Yes, you have.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.973
- Out of the corner of your eye.
- No.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.054
And you dismissed it,
because what choice do you have?

21:45.137 --> 21:46.889
When you see something
you can't possibly explain,

21:46.972 --> 21:49.350
you dismiss it, right?
And if anyone mentions it, you get angry.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.061
- So it's never spoken of ever again.
- She's a child.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.646
And you're terrified of her.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.572
But there's no one to turn to,
'cause who's gonna believe

21:55.689 --> 21:58.363
the things you see
out of the corner of your eye? No one.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.568
Except me.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.408
Who are you?

22:03.322 --> 22:04.699
I'm help.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.296
Those pictures, they're alive.

22:19.380 --> 22:21.929
She's drawing people
and they end up in her pictures.

22:22.007 --> 22:24.305
Ionic energy.
Chloe's harnessing it to steal those kids

22:24.385 --> 22:27.138
and place them in some kind of holding pen
made up of ionic power.

22:27.263 --> 22:29.265
And what about the dad from hell
in her wardrobe?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.817
How many times do I have to tell you?
He's dead.

22:32.268 --> 22:35.647
Well, he's got a very loud voice
for a dead bloke.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.902
If living things can become drawings,

22:37.982 --> 22:40.610
then maybe drawings
can become living things.

22:43.404 --> 22:44.701
Chloe's real dad is dead,

22:44.780 --> 22:46.623
but not the one who visits her
in her nightmares.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.077
That dad seems very real.
That's the dad she's drawn,

22:49.159 --> 22:52.288
and he's a heartbeat away
from crashing into this world.

22:52.413 --> 22:54.836
She always got the worst of it
when he was alive.

22:55.541 --> 22:58.966
Doctor, how can a 12-year-old girl
be doing any of this?

23:01.171 --> 23:02.718
Let's find out.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.032
Nice one.

23:31.493 --> 23:32.710
- There we go.
- I can't let him...

23:32.786 --> 23:34.379
Shh, it's okay. Trust him.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.675
Now we can talk.

23:39.501 --> 23:42.971
I want Chloe!
Wake her up!

23:43.047 --> 23:46.847
- I want Chloe!
- Who are you?

23:47.051 --> 23:50.555
- I want Chloe Webber!
- What have you done to my little girl?

23:50.638 --> 23:51.855
Doctor, what is it?

23:51.972 --> 23:54.270
I'm speaking to you,

23:54.350 --> 23:56.853
the entity that is using this human child.

23:58.687 --> 24:01.941
I request parley in compliance
with The Shadow Proclamation.

24:02.024 --> 24:05.528
I don't care about shadows or parleyses!

24:06.153 --> 24:07.746
So what do you care about?

24:07.947 --> 24:09.699
I want my friends.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.952
You're lonely, I know.

24:13.035 --> 24:14.537
Identify yourself.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.122
I am one of many.

24:16.205 --> 24:18.458
I travel with my brothers and sisters.

24:18.540 --> 24:23.216
We take an endless journey.
A thousand of your Lifetimes.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.636
But now I am alone. I hate it.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.467
It's not fair, and I hate it!

24:28.550 --> 24:29.767
Name yourself.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.311
Isolus.

24:32.346 --> 24:34.724
You're Isolus, of course.

24:35.391 --> 24:38.691
Our journey began in the deep realms,

24:38.811 --> 24:41.189
- when we were a family.
- What's that?

24:41.271 --> 24:43.990
The Isolus mother, drifting in deep space.

24:44.191 --> 24:47.320
See? She jettisons millions
of fledgling spores,

24:47.403 --> 24:48.746
her children.

24:49.530 --> 24:51.999
The Isolus are empathic beings
of intense emotion.

24:52.074 --> 24:54.202
When they're cast off
from their mother, their empathic link,

24:54.284 --> 24:57.037
their need for each other,
is what sustains them.

24:57.621 --> 25:01.000
They need to be together.
They cannot be alone.

25:01.083 --> 25:02.585
Our journey is long.

25:02.710 --> 25:04.838
The Isolus children travel,
each inside a pod.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.969
They ride the heat and energy
of solar tides.

25:08.882 --> 25:12.182
And it takes thousands and thousands
of years for them to grow up.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.769
Thousands of years
just floating through space?

25:16.390 --> 25:18.859
Poor things.
Don't they go mad with boredom?

25:18.934 --> 25:21.153
We play.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.947
You... play?

25:24.064 --> 25:26.112
While they travel,
they play a game.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.655
They use their ionic power

25:27.776 --> 25:30.780
to literally create make-believe worlds
in which to play.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.663
- In-flight entertainment.
- Helps keep them happy.

25:35.075 --> 25:38.329
While they're happy
they can feed off each other's love.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.790
Without it, they're lost.

25:43.459 --> 25:46.713
- Why did you come to Earth?
- We were too close.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.430
That's a solar flare from your sun.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.261
Would have made a tidal wave
of solar energy

25:54.344 --> 25:56.642
that scattered the Isolus pods.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.482
Only I fell to Earth.

25:59.016 --> 26:03.317
My brothers and sisters are left up there,
and I cannot reach them.

26:03.937 --> 26:07.441
- So alone!
- Your pod crashed?

26:07.524 --> 26:08.650
Where is it?

26:08.734 --> 26:10.236
My pod was drawn to heat.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.988
And I was drawn to Chloe Webber.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.167
She was like me. Alone.

26:20.662 --> 26:23.916
She needed me and I, her.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.127
You empathised with her.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.176
You wanted to be with her
because she was alone like you.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.798
I want my family!

26:30.881 --> 26:32.098
It's not fair!

26:32.174 --> 26:34.802
I understand. You wanna make a family.

26:34.885 --> 26:38.480
But you can't stay in this child.
It's wrong.

26:38.889 --> 26:41.267
You can't steal any more friends
for yourself.

26:41.350 --> 26:42.522
I am alone.

26:43.769 --> 26:48.400
I'm coming to hurt you.
I'm coming...

26:48.482 --> 26:50.484
- Trish, how do you calm her?
- What?

26:50.567 --> 26:52.319
When she has nightmares, what do you do?

26:52.402 --> 26:54.370
- What do you do?
- I sing to her.

26:54.488 --> 26:55.865
Then start singing.

26:55.989 --> 26:58.708
Chloe, I'm coming...

26:58.784 --> 27:01.378
♪ Kookaburra sits in the old gum tree

27:01.453 --> 27:04.502
♪ Merry merry king of the bush is he ♪

27:04.581 --> 27:05.673
Chloe!

27:06.959 --> 27:08.552
Chloe!

27:11.588 --> 27:13.807
♪ ...kookaburra, laugh, kookaburra

27:13.882 --> 27:16.226
♪ Gay your life must be ♪

27:18.804 --> 27:20.932
It came to her because she was lonely.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.225
Chloe, I'm sorry.

27:27.312 --> 27:30.816
Chloe usually got the brunt of his temper,
when he'd had a drink.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.402
The day he crashed the car,
I thought we were free.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.078
I thought it was over.

27:35.571 --> 27:38.165
- Did you talk to her about it?
- I didn't want to.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.753
But maybe that's why Chloe feels so alone,

27:42.828 --> 27:45.798
'cause she has all these
terrible dreams about her dad,

27:45.914 --> 27:47.882
but she can't talk to you about them.

27:47.958 --> 27:50.052
Her and the Isolus,

27:50.127 --> 27:52.596
two lonely kids who need each other.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.799
And it won't stop, will it, Doctor?

27:55.424 --> 27:57.677
Just keep pulling kids in.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.053
It's desperate to be loved.

28:00.387 --> 28:03.436
- And it's used to a pretty big family.
- How big?

28:04.850 --> 28:08.104
Say around four billion?

28:08.770 --> 28:12.070
In and out of central London.
It is remarkable.

28:12.774 --> 28:17.154
The queue started a week ago
for those desperate enough to be inside,

28:17.279 --> 28:18.405
and there are lots of them.

28:18.488 --> 28:21.241
We 're expecting
a capacity crowd of 80, 000

28:21.325 --> 28:24.795
for this evening's opening ceremony.
I have to say there's been...

28:24.912 --> 28:26.380
We need that pod.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.048
It crashed. Won't it be destroyed?

28:28.123 --> 28:29.625
Well, it's been sucking in
all the heat it can.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.911
Hopefully that should keep it
in a fit state to launch.

28:31.960 --> 28:32.961
It must be close.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.446
It should have a weak energy signature
the Tardis can trace.

28:35.505 --> 28:38.304
Once we find it,
then we can stop the Isolus.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.388
She's running a temperature.

28:43.180 --> 28:47.731
I can't go into that now, Kirsty.
Yes, we've got a doctor.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.026
Yeah, he said he can help her.

28:51.980 --> 28:55.359
We can scan for the same trace that I
picked up from the scribble creature.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.661
Just need to widen the field a bit.

29:10.791 --> 29:14.011
You knew the Isolus was lonely
before it told you. How?

29:14.253 --> 29:16.096
I know what it's like to travel a long way
on your own.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.390
Give me the steino-magnetic... Um...

29:18.966 --> 29:20.092
Thing in your left hand.

29:20.175 --> 29:21.643
Sounds like you're on its side.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.095
I sympathise, that's all.

29:23.178 --> 29:25.681
The Isolus has caused a lot of pain
for these people.

29:25.764 --> 29:30.019
It's a child. That's why it went to Chloe.
Two lonely mixed-up kids.

29:30.143 --> 29:32.987
Feels to me like a temper tantrum
'cause it can't get its own way.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.157
It's scared. Come on, you were a kid once.

29:35.232 --> 29:36.404
- Binary dot.
- Yes.

29:36.483 --> 29:40.533
And I know what kids can be like.
Right little... terrors.

29:46.368 --> 29:49.372
- Gum.
- I've got cousins.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.752
Kids can't have it all their own way.
That's part of being a family.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.960
And what about trying to understand them?

29:54.626 --> 29:58.426
- Easy for you to say, you don't have kids.
- I was a dad once.

29:58.505 --> 30:00.132
What did you say?

30:01.842 --> 30:05.722
I think we're there. Fear. Loneliness.
They're the big ones, Rose.

30:05.804 --> 30:08.808
Some of the most terrible acts ever
committed have been inspired by them.

30:08.890 --> 30:13.145
We're not dealing with something
that wants to conquer or destroy.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.481
There's a lot of things you need
to get across this universe,

30:15.564 --> 30:19.865
warp drive, wormhole refractors.
You know the thing you need most of all?

30:19.943 --> 30:22.037
You need a hand to hold.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.792
No, no, I'm pointing.

30:28.410 --> 30:31.539
It's the pod! It is in the street!

30:31.663 --> 30:34.166
Everything's coming up Doctor.

30:40.005 --> 30:44.101
Okay, it's like, two inches across.
Dull grey, like a gull's egg, very light.

30:44.217 --> 30:47.642
So these pods they travel
from some sun using heat, yeah?

30:47.763 --> 30:49.640
So it's not all about love and stuff.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.020
Doesn't the pod just need heat?

30:54.102 --> 30:55.399
Doctor?

30:58.065 --> 30:59.612
Doctor!

31:04.112 --> 31:06.661
It's okay, I've taken all
the pencils off her.

31:11.286 --> 31:13.288
Leave me alone!

31:13.372 --> 31:16.797
I want to be with Chloe Webber!
I love Chloe Webber!

31:16.958 --> 31:19.461
- Bring him back now.
- No!

31:20.212 --> 31:22.385
Don't you realise what you've done?

31:22.464 --> 31:24.683
He was the only one who could help you.
Now bring him back!

31:24.758 --> 31:27.887
Leave me alone! I love Chloe Webber!

31:32.224 --> 31:33.771
I kn ow.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.483
I kn ow.

31:39.147 --> 31:42.117
Doctor, if you can hear me,
I'm gonna get you out of there.

31:42.192 --> 31:43.910
I'll find the pod.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.405
Don't leave her alone, no matter what.

31:46.488 --> 31:49.708
The torchbearer getting
even closer to the Olympic Stadium,

31:49.783 --> 31:52.662
heading down the Strand before
turning east along the Embankment...

31:53.912 --> 31:57.507
Heat. They travel on heat.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.668
Look at this finish.

31:59.751 --> 32:04.006
Smooth as a baby's bottom.
Not a bump or a lump.

32:04.172 --> 32:07.972
Kel, was there anything in this street in
the last few days giving off a lot of heat?

32:08.051 --> 32:10.520
I mean, you could eat your dinner off this.

32:10.679 --> 32:13.853
Beautiful. So, you tell me
why the other one's got a lump in it

32:13.974 --> 32:17.353
when I gave it the same love
and craftsmanship as I did this one.

32:17.436 --> 32:21.111
Well, when you've worked it out,
put it in a big book about tarmacking.

32:21.189 --> 32:24.238
But before you do that,
think back six days.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.611
Six days.

32:26.695 --> 32:28.663
When I was laying this
the first time round.

32:28.738 --> 32:29.785
What?

32:29.865 --> 32:32.835
Well, that's when I filled in this pothole
for the first time.

32:32.909 --> 32:35.378
- Six days ago.
- Yeah.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.497
Hot, fresh ta r.

32:37.873 --> 32:40.171
Blended to a secret council recipe.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.423
No, I don't keep it in the van.

32:43.628 --> 32:46.256
Hey! That's a council van. Out.

32:48.175 --> 32:49.597
Whoa! Wait... Wait a minute!

32:49.676 --> 32:52.270
You’ve just removed a council axe
from a council van.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.559
Put it back! No, don't, wait.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.061
If it's going in the van, that's my van.
Gimme the axe!

32:56.141 --> 32:59.896
Wait! No! No! You... Stop!

33:00.770 --> 33:03.819
You just took a council axe
from a council van,

33:03.899 --> 33:06.277
and now you're digging up a council road!

33:06.401 --> 33:08.369
I'm reporting you to the council!

33:12.407 --> 33:16.002
It went for the hottest thing
in the street, yeah? Your tar.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.580
- What is it?
- It's a spaceship.

33:18.663 --> 33:20.757
Not a council spaceship, I'm afraid.

33:21.249 --> 33:24.093
"joined us, welcome.
We're live on BBC News 24."

33:24.169 --> 33:27.890
The opening ceremony
of the London Olympics of 2072.

33:27.964 --> 33:30.717
Well underway,
athletes from all over the world

33:30.800 --> 33:34.020
streaming into the stadium right now.
They all have their dreams.

33:34.095 --> 33:36.939
They've all put in years of hard work...

33:37.933 --> 33:39.480
I found it!

33:39.851 --> 33:43.776
Don't know what to do with it, but maybe
the Isolus will just hop on board.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.149
Hang on, I told you not to leave her.

33:46.942 --> 33:50.116
My God!
Uh, what's going on here?

33:50.237 --> 33:53.116
I don't care if you got Snow White
and the Seven Dwarves buried under there,

33:53.198 --> 33:54.918
- you don't go digging...
- Shut up and look!

33:54.950 --> 33:56.167
The crowd has vanished.

33:56.243 --> 33:59.873
Um, they're gone, everyone has gone.

33:59.955 --> 34:05.132
Thousands of people have just gone,
uh, right in from' of my eyes.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.838
Um, it's impossible.

34:07.921 --> 34:12.176
<i>Bob, can we join you in the box? Bob?</i>

34:13.885 --> 34:17.230
- Not you too, Bob!
- A stadium won't be enough.

34:17.304 --> 34:20.900
The Isolus has
four billion brothers and sisters.

34:22.435 --> 34:27.440
Over 80, 000 spectators
and 30, 000 athletes...

34:27.524 --> 34:29.197
Not enough.

34:29.650 --> 34:32.905
They're gone, all of those people.

34:33.862 --> 34:37.833
Uh, it's a terrible,
terrible turn of events...

34:37.909 --> 34:42.289
We won't be alone, Chloe Webber.
We'll have all of them.

34:42.371 --> 34:46.127
And then we'll never feel alone ever again.

34:48.460 --> 34:51.556
- Chloe?
- Chloe, it's Rose! Open the door!

34:54.467 --> 34:56.469
We found your ship!
We can send you home.

34:56.553 --> 34:58.851
- Chloe!
- Open up!

34:58.972 --> 35:00.440
Right, stand back.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.984
I'm coming to hurt you.

35:08.273 --> 35:12.244
I'm coming. Coming to hurt you, Chloe.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.452
- Chloe!
- I'm coming to hurt you!

35:20.076 --> 35:21.828
- I'm coming.
- I've gotta stop her.

35:23.663 --> 35:26.963
If you stop Chloe Webber,
I will let him out.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.465
We will let him out. Together.

35:29.544 --> 35:32.423
I cannot be alone! It's not fair!

35:33.673 --> 35:35.892
- Look, I've got your pod!
- The pod is dead!

35:36.009 --> 35:38.762
- No, no. It only needs heat.
- It needs more than heat.

35:38.887 --> 35:39.934
What then?

35:40.055 --> 35:43.400
I'm not being funny or nothing,
but that picture just moved.

35:44.059 --> 35:46.403
And that one!

35:49.606 --> 35:51.779
She didn't draw that, he did.

35:53.193 --> 35:55.321
But it needs more than heat, Doctor.

35:55.445 --> 35:59.746
Still on its way.
I suppose it's much more than a torch now.

35:59.866 --> 36:03.712
<i>It's a beacon. It's a beacon
of hope and fortitude and courage.</i>

36:03.870 --> 36:07.295
- And it's a beacon of love.
- Love.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.550
So left have a look from the helicopter.

36:09.626 --> 36:13.256
- There we go, the torchbearer.-.
- I know how to charge up the pod.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.306
Past Dame Kelly Holmes Close...

36:29.938 --> 36:32.236
- Sorry, you'll have to watch from here.
- No, I've gotta get closer!

36:32.315 --> 36:34.488
- No way.
- I can stop this from happening!

36:34.609 --> 36:35.986
Chloe.

36:36.069 --> 36:37.992
- Chloe.
- I'm coming to hurt you.

36:38.071 --> 36:39.118
My baby!

36:39.197 --> 36:42.451
- You're not going to hurt her again!
- Chloe! I'm coming!

36:47.956 --> 36:49.879
You felt it, didn't you?

36:58.633 --> 37:00.135
Feel the love.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.287
I can go home.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.460
Goodbye, Chloe Webber.

37:26.161 --> 37:27.834
I love you.

37:36.045 --> 37:39.140
- Mum?
- I'm here.

37:39.424 --> 37:40.846
Mummy!

37:44.846 --> 37:46.974
Nice one! You did it!

37:48.558 --> 37:50.936
What was it you did?

37:53.021 --> 37:54.113
Yeah!

38:04.365 --> 38:05.412
Mummy!

38:05.533 --> 38:07.206
Oh, Jane!

38:12.040 --> 38:13.417
Doctor?

38:13.541 --> 38:14.838
He's back now.

38:17.128 --> 38:21.508
I don't know who you are, or what you did,
but thank you, darling.

38:22.383 --> 38:25.227
And thank that man from me, too.

38:27.430 --> 38:29.853
Where is he? He should be here.

38:33.102 --> 38:35.400
All the drawings have come to life.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.692
That means all of them.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.320
Oh no...

38:50.912 --> 38:53.165
- Trish, get out!
- I can't. The door's stuck.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.841
- Is the Doctor in there?
- I don't think so.

38:54.916 --> 38:56.589
Mummy!

38:58.419 --> 39:01.389
I'm coming to hurt you!

39:01.464 --> 39:04.764
- Please, Dad, no more.
- Chloe!

39:04.884 --> 39:07.182
Chloe, listen to me.
It isn't real like the others.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.310
It's just energy left over by the Isolus.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.899
- But you can get rid of it, Chloe.
- Help us!

39:12.016 --> 39:13.896
Oh, it's 'cause you're so scared
that he's real.

39:13.935 --> 39:16.029
But you can get shot of him, Chloe.

39:16.104 --> 39:18.448
- Mummy!
- You can do it, Chloe!

39:18.523 --> 39:19.524
I can't!

39:19.607 --> 39:22.656
Chloe! I'm coming!

39:22.777 --> 39:23.869
I can't!

39:23.945 --> 39:26.869
- I'm coming!
- I can't!

39:26.948 --> 39:31.545
- I'm coming! Chloe!
- Mummy!

39:31.619 --> 39:36.170
I'm with you, Chloe. You're not alone.
You'll never be alone again.

39:36.291 --> 39:39.295
- I'm coming to hurt you.
- Sing again. Chloe, sing!

39:39.377 --> 39:40.549
Chloe! Chloe!

39:40.628 --> 39:42.050

Maybe he's gone somewhere.

40:27.008 --> 40:29.136
Who's gonna hold his hand now?

40:35.516 --> 40:40.317
Just look at this. Utterly
incredible scenes at the Olympic Stadium.

40:40.396 --> 40:44.367
<i>80, 000 athletes and spectators,
the y disappeared, they've come back.</i>

40:44.442 --> 40:45.614
They've returned.

40:45.693 --> 40:48.367
They've re-appearead.
It's quite incredible.

40:48.488 --> 40:50.049
But, Bob, this will certainly prompt...

40:50.114 --> 40:53.789
80,000 people. So where's the Doctor?
I need him!

40:53.868 --> 40:56.963
But hang on. The torchbearer seems to be
in a bit of trouble.

40:57.038 --> 41:01.214
We did see a ﬂash of lightning earlier
that seemed to strike him.

41:01.292 --> 41:04.717
Maybe he's injured.
He's definitely in trouble.

41:05.421 --> 41:09.392
This mean that the Olympic dream is dead?

41:10.343 --> 41:11.640
Doctor!

41:12.720 --> 41:13.846
There 3 a mystery man.

41:13.930 --> 41:17.104
He's picked up the flame,
and we've no idea who he is.

41:18.226 --> 41:20.604
He 3 carrying the flame,
yes, he's carrying the flame,

41:20.687 --> 41:22.689
and no one wants to stop him.

41:22.814 --> 41:26.114
It's more than a ﬂame now, Bob.
It's more than heat and light.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.911
It's hope, and its courage, and it's love.

41:49.757 --> 41:54.684
Go on. join your brothers and sisters.
They'll be waiting!

42:22.915 --> 42:23.962
Cake?

42:30.715 --> 42:32.467
Top banana!

42:36.596 --> 42:41.477
I can't stress this enough.
Ball bearings you can eat. Masterpiece!

42:43.978 --> 42:47.858
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Nah. Not on a night like this.

42:48.483 --> 42:51.612
This is a night for lost
things being found. Come on.

42:51.694 --> 42:53.662
What now?

42:53.738 --> 42:56.287
I wanna go to the Games,
it's what we came for.

42:56.365 --> 42:58.459
Go on. Give us a clue.

42:58.785 --> 43:00.662
Which events do we do well in?

43:00.745 --> 43:02.543
Well, I will tell you this,

43:02.622 --> 43:05.967
Papua New Guinea surprised everyone
in the shot put.

43:06.042 --> 43:09.171
Really? You're joking, aren't you?

43:09.253 --> 43:12.006
Doctor? Are you serious, or are you joking?

43:12.090 --> 43:13.182
Wait and see.

43:16.803 --> 43:19.352
You know what?
They keep on trying to split us up,

43:19.472 --> 43:21.019
but they never ever will.

43:21.516 --> 43:24.065
Never say, "Never ever."

43:25.520 --> 43:27.943
Nah, we'll always be okay, you and me.

43:30.149 --> 43:32.197
Don't you reckon, Doctor?

43:33.361 --> 43:35.784
Something in the air. Something coming.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.865
What?

43:38.491 --> 43:40.368
A storm's approaching.

43:49.001 --> 43:51.550
This is a story of war on Earth.

43:51.629 --> 43:57.307
The valiant child
who will die in battle so very soon.

43:57.385 --> 43:59.012
It said I was gonna die in battle.

43:59.095 --> 44:00.312
Then it lied.

44:00.388 --> 44:03.733
Welcome to Torchwood.

44:04.016 --> 44:06.018
Woke up one morning,
and there they all were.

44:06.102 --> 44:07.775
Ghosts everywhere.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.855
If I'm the enemy,
does that mean I'm the prisoner?

44:09.897 --> 44:11.069
Oh, yes.

44:11.732 --> 44:13.700
Oi! Where are you taking that?

44:13.776 --> 44:15.244
If it's alien, it's ours.

44:15.361 --> 44:16.738
We've got a problem down here.

44:17.071 --> 44:18.323
Yvonne, can you hear me?

44:18.406 --> 44:19.999
You send that thing back into hell.

44:20.074 --> 44:23.954
The Doctor, lording it over us, assuming
alien authority over the rights of man.

44:24.036 --> 44:26.334
They're bleeding through
the fault lines.

44:26.414 --> 44:29.418
Walking from their world, across the void,
and into yours.

44:31.294 --> 44:32.637
You can't stop us, Doctor.

44:32.753 --> 44:34.005
This world is colliding
with another.

44:34.088 --> 44:35.431
Positions!

44:35.756 --> 44:37.178
What are they?

44:38.759 --> 44:39.931
Cybermen.

44:43.931 --> 44:45.524
And that's when it all ended.

44:47.018 --> 44:50.022
This is the last story I'll ever tell.
