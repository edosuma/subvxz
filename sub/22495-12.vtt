didn't catch on at all.

09:00.991 --> 09:04.225
So I got a new look, a new
name, something blunter.

09:04.261 --> 09:08.930
I've re-branded myself now
as Horton: Who hunter.

09:08.932 --> 09:11.432
From the shadows, the cat
in the hat overheard and

09:11.501 --> 09:13.868
approaching the Lorax said...
What up, nerd?!

09:13.903 --> 09:16.037
You taught the kids to responsibly play.

09:16.072 --> 09:19.340
But the cat in the hat said...
That crap didn't pay!

09:19.342 --> 09:20.708
Forget cleaning house.

09:20.776 --> 09:22.610
I'm straight cleaning up, guy!

09:22.645 --> 09:25.813
Now I'm off to go hang with Jamiroquai.

09:25.881 --> 09:29.349
I'm living the dream, and if
parents are pissed, they can put

09:29.417 --> 09:32.351
in a call to my new publicists-- 
thing 1 and thing

09:32.420 --> 09:34.153
2, they're both on my payroll.

09:34.188 --> 09:35.487
The Lorax was stunned.

09:35.522 --> 09:36.254
Holy crap!

09:36.323 --> 09:37.155
What an a-hole!

09:37.224 --> 09:37.722
No more!

09:37.791 --> 09:38.723
...said the Lorax.

09:38.792 --> 09:40.258
No more of these speeches!

09:40.326 --> 09:41.692
How 'bout just one more?

09:41.728 --> 09:43.094
You remember the sneetches?

09:43.163 --> 09:46.363
We once had a message, and
a good one, too, bro.

09:46.399 --> 09:47.865
But did we get a movie?

09:47.900 --> 09:48.799
Well, did we?

09:48.868 --> 09:50.000
All: Hell, no!

09:50.036 --> 09:53.604
We tried to teach tolerance,
and where did that get us?

09:53.639 --> 09:54.605
So [bleep] it!

09:54.640 --> 09:57.140
We'd rather make mountains of lettuce!

09:57.176 --> 09:58.642
There's my house.

09:58.677 --> 10:00.277
It's 12 stories with 40

10:00.345 --> 10:03.780
jacuzzis, 6 cars, 19
butlers, unlimited floozies.

10:03.815 --> 10:05.448
It's what it's about, man.

10:05.483 --> 10:06.449
It's capitalism.

10:06.518 --> 10:09.719
And the Lorax responded
with geysers of jism.

10:09.754 --> 10:14.356
Thanks to the moolah, that marketing
whore, he could finally see what he hadn't

10:14.391 --> 10:14.923
before.

10:14.992 --> 10:18.460
I'll get me an agent, an
accountant named Herschel, a toy

10:18.496 --> 10:20.729
line, a lunchbox, an iHop commercial.

10:20.798 --> 10:24.366
Then the Lorax got rich and was
totally stoked -- till the

10:24.401 --> 10:26.902
day he contracted AIDS and then croaked.

10:26.937 --> 10:28.036
What?!

10:28.322 --> 10:38.661
