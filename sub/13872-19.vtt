00:06.806 --> 00:09.070
- I'm back from lunch.
- Where's mine?

00:12.645 --> 00:15.409
I thought you said you don't like to eat...

00:15.482 --> 00:18.246
'cause you said food makes you really...

00:20.620 --> 00:23.555
- crazy.
- This makes me really crazy!

00:24.657 --> 00:26.625
Give me some fries, boy.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.966
<i>This is Carl.
Leave a message or leave me alone.</i>

01:16.076 --> 01:18.067
<i>Either way, I don't care.</i>

01:18.678 --> 01:22.614
<i>Unless this is Mom,
in which case, Happy Mother's Day.</i>

01:23.183 --> 01:24.480
<i>Hey, buddy, how's it going?</i>

01:24.551 --> 01:27.042
<i>I just happened to check the pH levels
in your pool...</i>

01:27.120 --> 01:30.146
and they are incredibly high. Not good.

01:30.223 --> 01:32.885
Fix it or I'm getting a lawyer. Okay, bye.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.392
- Did you ask him?
- What'd he say?

01:34.494 --> 01:36.485
- It's cool. We're all good.
- Hell, yeah.

01:37.263 --> 01:40.164
- Hey, buddy.
- You were home the whole time?

01:40.233 --> 01:43.725
He don't ever leave the house.
He's one of them shut-offs.

01:43.803 --> 01:46.363
Shutout. Wait, what the hell's he called?

01:46.439 --> 01:48.236
- It's a shut-up.
- Yeah, it's a shut-up.

01:48.308 --> 01:49.969
I never thought you'd screen with me.

01:50.043 --> 01:53.308
I was just lighting the grill,
waiting for you guys to come over...

01:53.379 --> 01:55.279
have a little barbecue, a little beer.

01:55.348 --> 01:57.839
- You know I love you guys.
- Carl, you all right?

01:57.917 --> 02:00.147
- You're acting strange.
- No, I'm not.

02:00.220 --> 02:02.552
- Yes, you are.
- Come on. Race over here.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.955
- Last one in is a rotten egg.
- Shake's a rotten egg!

02:06.326 --> 02:09.454
- Boy, that feels hot.
- Come on, why'd you stop?

02:09.562 --> 02:12.258
- Keep coming. You're so close.
- Yeah, come on.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.094
- No, Meatwad, don't!
- What?

02:15.101 --> 02:16.500
Wait for it.

02:19.072 --> 02:22.439
Good, it works.
You try doing that with your body now.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.600
- Okay.
- No, Meatwad, stop!

02:24.677 --> 02:26.144
Carl, top shelf.

02:26.212 --> 02:30.239
Not the high-end model, but it works
for you and your income bracket.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.285
But don't worry. I'm not gonna
tell anybody how cheap you are.

02:33.386 --> 02:36.844
Yeah, come closer, Shake man.
You won't tell anybody anything.

02:36.923 --> 02:39.050
- Ever again.
- Damn, that thing is bright.

02:39.125 --> 02:43.061
It better be bright. The dude
guaranteed me you can see it from space.

02:49.235 --> 02:52.966
D.P., that dude totally cut you off, man.
Flip him some birdage, bigtime!

02:53.039 --> 02:56.406
Suck on that, padre.
You messed with the wrong frat.

02:56.476 --> 03:00.037
- He knows. Yeah, you!
- There's no one in there, dude.

03:01.814 --> 03:05.807
- Well, my dad totally owns a dealership.
- What's that over there?

03:06.152 --> 03:09.849
- Sweet. Floor it, dude.
- What do you think I've been doing?

03:16.095 --> 03:18.359
I thought we was gonna take turns on this.

03:18.464 --> 03:20.830
How come I'm still in the hole
and you're still...

03:20.900 --> 03:22.197
<i>Is that The Jeffersons?</i>

03:22.302 --> 03:24.099
- No, we traded turns, remember?
- No.

03:24.170 --> 03:27.298
You traded one of your turns
for three of my turns...

03:27.373 --> 03:30.206
- and a turn to be named later.
- I'll tell you this.

03:30.310 --> 03:34.076
I'll be pissed if I get over there
and he ain't changed the pH in our pool.

03:34.147 --> 03:35.512
I'm with you on that one.

03:35.582 --> 03:37.948
<i>Carl, if you wouldn't mind...</i>

03:38.017 --> 03:40.952
<i>could you please
turn your security grid the... off...</i>

03:41.020 --> 03:42.510
<i>so I can get some sleep?</i>

03:42.589 --> 03:44.420
Hang on, let me think.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.317
No.

03:52.599 --> 03:55.397
Dude, you want to move your thing?
You almost killed us.

03:55.501 --> 03:57.025
Are you begging me instead...

03:57.136 --> 04:00.105
to mess up your pizza face
in front of your girlfriend there?

04:00.173 --> 04:02.368
- Because I'll do it.
- It's not worth it, dude!

04:02.442 --> 04:04.740
Look at my ship, man!
My dad's gonna be pissed.

04:04.811 --> 04:08.838
Do you know who his dad is?
He's totally rich.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.008
He will totally hook you up, dude.
We're drunk.

04:12.118 --> 04:13.551
Are these friends of yours?

04:13.620 --> 04:16.783
- Where's the club? I need to piss.
- They came from space, you know.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.416
Typically, that means
you're somehow connected.

04:19.492 --> 04:21.187
I've never seen them before in my life.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.320
So then you don't mind if I talk to her?

04:23.396 --> 04:26.661
Her? Yeah, knock yourself out.
She's a regular ho bag.

04:26.766 --> 04:28.063
What's up, little lady?

04:28.167 --> 04:30.965
- She's got a bit of a 'stache.
- She's good to go.

04:31.671 --> 04:35.232
My dad's totally rich. We own
this dealership. What sorority are you in?

04:35.308 --> 04:38.209
Excuse me? I think you might have me
confused with a woman.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.770
- She burned you, dude!
- So you couldn't get into a sorority?

04:41.848 --> 04:45.284
- I'm a man, all right?
- This is beat. Total sausage party.

04:46.052 --> 04:48.885
I think. But we're out of here.
Come on, D.P. Let's go.

04:48.988 --> 04:53.391
What else is open, besides your mouth
when you're kissing on some gay dude...

04:53.459 --> 04:57.088
and holding his muscles
'cause his arms are wrapped around you...

04:57.196 --> 05:01.257
and you feel so safe, 'cause you're, like...
Not that you're gay or nothing.

05:01.334 --> 05:04.235
But, God, you just want to bury yourself
in his chest...

05:04.304 --> 05:06.864
and just live there forever?

05:07.874 --> 05:09.034
I'm out of here.

05:09.108 --> 05:11.303
Dude and the "P," come on.
I got the munchies.

05:11.411 --> 05:15.040
- Hang on. What's your name, babe?
- I'm Shake.

05:15.114 --> 05:18.675
You want to take me to your dorm room
for a drink or something?

05:18.751 --> 05:22.152
No, but I believe this little lady
needs to have a life experience.

05:22.255 --> 05:24.314
- Come here.
- What you doing? Don't kiss me!

05:24.424 --> 05:26.654
- It's cool. I got rubbers. What?
- No, get away!

05:26.726 --> 05:29.889
- You stay outside. You're scaring me.
- Rejected!

05:30.663 --> 05:32.722
I said, drink all of it, ass head!

05:32.832 --> 05:35.096
Lap it up, ass head,
or you're never getting in.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.829
- Pledge!
- Come on, pledge. Drink up.

05:36.903 --> 05:39.269
Come on, let's go back to the house.
I need to eat.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.772
No, this girl totally wants me.

05:40.873 --> 05:43.341
Dude, forget it.
She was sporting some major LB's.

05:43.409 --> 05:46.310
It's like a moped.
Fun to ride until your friends see you.

05:46.379 --> 05:49.280
Stop doing that.
Don't knock on this window.

05:52.318 --> 05:54.479
How about we have a panty raid?

05:54.554 --> 05:58.456
- Okay, good. Throw on up there and then...
- Cool. See you tomorrow.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.026
Is he still out there?

06:01.127 --> 06:03.687
I ain't gonna find out.
That old boy tried to kiss me.

06:03.763 --> 06:06.061
You know what that means, don't you?

06:06.232 --> 06:08.427
Somebody's a little bi-curious.

06:08.501 --> 06:10.628
I ain't no bi-curious. I'm a man's man.

06:10.737 --> 06:13.706
Not anymore.
I've planted the seed of doubt!

06:13.773 --> 06:16.071
You don't say that. I'm a man!

06:16.609 --> 06:19.737
And if y'all need me,
I'm gonna be in the garage.

06:19.812 --> 06:22.781
Hanging Sheetrock, rounding edges...

06:22.849 --> 06:24.248
Look at the way he rolls.

06:24.350 --> 06:27.012
- Where's my chewing tobacco?
- Just like a woman.

06:28.321 --> 06:30.050
- What?
- Wake up, frat boy.

06:30.123 --> 06:33.786
I hate to do this, but I'm gonna
have to ask you to get off my lawn.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.420
Man. What time is it?

06:36.496 --> 06:38.623
It's 1:00 p. m.

06:38.798 --> 06:41.824
- Wake and bake, dude. Are you Holden?
- No.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.062
- Did William Holden come to the party?
- No.

06:44.170 --> 06:48.266
- You got Holden Caulfield in there?
- No, we don't do that here.

06:48.374 --> 06:50.706
You know where my...

06:50.810 --> 06:53.005
- What is this?
- This is New Jersey.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.240
- Planet Earth?
- Yeah, where's my bro?

06:55.314 --> 06:57.305
- He left you here.
- How did my probe...

06:57.417 --> 07:00.215
- Man, look at my probe.
- Yeah, I know.

07:00.286 --> 07:03.813
You stuck it in that laser because
you thought it was some girl's breast.

07:03.890 --> 07:05.721
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I am.

07:05.825 --> 07:07.452
- The party probe.
- Brother.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.995
- Did I feel her up, dude?
- It was a laser.

07:10.062 --> 07:11.256
Busted.

07:12.031 --> 07:13.589
Okay, it's time for you to go.

07:13.666 --> 07:16.032
Seriously? You don't want to
play hacky sack?

07:16.102 --> 07:18.570
- No, I don't.
- D.P. What's up?

07:18.805 --> 07:21.205
You were so wasted last night. It was sick.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.606
- You know it, bro.
- Here you go, dude.

07:23.676 --> 07:26.440
- Breakfast of champions.
- Sweet. Want to shotgun?

07:26.512 --> 07:28.946
- Beam me up. Let's go!
- Shake, what are you doing?

07:29.048 --> 07:32.506
Yo, D.P., this GDI wants to know
what I'm doing.

07:32.585 --> 07:35.645
What should I tell him?
That we're gonna kick his ass?

07:35.721 --> 07:38.519
I'll go and get you a ride,
'cause I want you off my lawn.

07:40.893 --> 07:43.521
- This is your ID?
- What are you, a cop?

07:43.963 --> 07:47.490
- Yeah, that's me.
- You know, you have to tell me if you are.

07:47.567 --> 07:50.161
I'll just type in your coordinates
and send you back...

07:50.269 --> 07:53.432
to Carnivorous Howling
Stump Monster planet.

07:53.906 --> 07:57.569
- Good thing you're an organ donor.
- Look, I just use that to get into bars.

07:57.677 --> 07:59.304
Okay, then what's your real name?

07:59.378 --> 08:01.903
Bros call me D.P.
Short for Donkey Puncher.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.243
- Get it?
- Yeah, I do.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.114
Sometimes I'm Donkey Puncharello
or D. to the P.

08:06.185 --> 08:08.050
- Or Big D.P.
- Dude's a player!

08:08.120 --> 08:10.554
- Or King Donko of Punchstanium.
- Dude, party!

08:10.656 --> 08:13.784
No, I need your real name.
What your mother calls you.

08:15.695 --> 08:17.458
You know what? Just try "D.P."

08:17.530 --> 08:19.930
"Dude Pal". That's what you should be.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.263
Because you're my dude, pal!

08:22.335 --> 08:26.328
- Your buddy here is giving me a rash.
- He usually doesn't drink this much.

08:26.405 --> 08:28.498
- I out party you.
- Shake, will you sit down?

08:28.574 --> 08:31.702
P.D., I know how to throw down.

08:32.211 --> 08:35.476
Dude. And I almost said "throw up,"
but I didn't.

08:35.715 --> 08:37.307
I hold my booze!

08:37.950 --> 08:41.477
- This is beer number two for him, right?
- I hold boobs all day, too.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.419
What's your fraternity brother's name?

08:43.523 --> 08:46.720
Zarnold Quigley, born in South End,
New Quasar, major in Business.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.022
Okay, that's enough.
AII I need is his name.

08:49.128 --> 08:52.120
I had to know all that
or they'd have killed me in Hell Week.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.133
- I feel floaty.
- We're connecting with the satellite now.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.567
Wait a couple of hours.
He won't be up right now.

08:57.637 --> 09:00.367
Dude, show him
that sweet lung tat you got.

09:00.439 --> 09:02.999
Wait till you see this. This is so awesome.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.600
Had to do it on the inside
or my dad would kill me.

09:05.711 --> 09:09.112
I had to get wasted, 'cause it hurt like
eight bitches on a bitch boat.

09:09.181 --> 09:11.945
That's so gross,
and I am so getting one of those.

09:12.018 --> 09:15.647
I want to be a part of you.
I wish we could sew ourselves together.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.315
Dude, get off my shirt.
It's worth more than your ass.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.383
- My dad owns a dealership.
- Hello. Is this Zarnold?

09:21.460 --> 09:24.691
<i>Call me Skeeter.
You're blowing my rep, lady. In the house.</i>

09:24.764 --> 09:26.664
Okay, look, Skeeter.

09:26.933 --> 09:30.164
I have your frat brother here,
and he needs to be picked up now.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.794
<i>Are you serious?</i>

09:31.871 --> 09:34.965
<i>- Is that a problem, or...
- Well, it's like...</i>

09:36.442 --> 09:38.637
<i>- It's like what?
- You know...</i>

09:39.111 --> 09:41.511
<i>- I mean, it's so far.
- Yeah, I know.</i>

09:41.581 --> 09:45.073
<i>I mean, could you...
I mean, if you were cool...</i>

09:45.184 --> 09:46.674
<i>You're cool, right?</i>

09:46.786 --> 09:50.415
If you're looking at me, I'm cool.
Is that Skeeter?

09:50.489 --> 09:52.889
Skeeter, did you score last night?

09:52.992 --> 09:55.483
<i>Okay, look, would you totally...</i>

09:56.162 --> 09:59.427
<i>Maybe, you know, sort of, like...</i>

09:59.498 --> 10:01.432
<i>- Give him a ride?
- Sweet. Thanks, dude.</i>

10:01.500 --> 10:02.592
Wait. Hello?

10:02.668 --> 10:05.535
I can chill out a bit.
I've already flunked out, but it's cool.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.836
I'll work at my dad's dealership.
My dad owns this dealership.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.102
I know.

10:10.176 --> 10:14.078
<i>His daddy owns a dealership. Damn, y'all!</i>

10:14.180 --> 10:15.909
Sweet. How do I get in?

10:16.015 --> 10:18.279
You don't.
I'll just strap you to the nose cone.

10:18.384 --> 10:21.251
Convertible. Awesome. Wait, hang on.

10:21.320 --> 10:25.916
Did you see a little naked dude
out in the street anywhere?

10:26.125 --> 10:28.992
- Yeah, I think he's dead.
- Are you serious?

10:29.662 --> 10:32.563
- When he wakes up, make him drink.
- D.P., where are you going?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.031
- Light it quick.
- Okay.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.829
That's a sweet ride.

10:41.707 --> 10:46.110
Those guys are solid dudes.
I am totally rushing them in the fall.

10:46.212 --> 10:49.909
What was that noise?
Like I give a bull crap.

10:50.249 --> 10:53.412
I'm a man, boy. I'm macho.
I ain't no bi-curious.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.716
As far as that,
how come my muscles be all big...

10:55.821 --> 10:57.413
and wearing this spandex?
