(GROANS)

18:57.763 --> 18:59.515
Happy Halloween.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.975
(BOTH SIGH)

19:02.976 --> 19:04.436
Oh, man...

19:06.104 --> 19:07.981
I always dress up for Halloween.

19:09.399 --> 19:10.943
It's my favorite holiday.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.862
When I was a little girl,

19:14.988 --> 19:16.573
I used to love the candy.

19:17.407 --> 19:18.534
(CHUCKLES)

19:21.578 --> 19:23.664
I think Halloween gives
people the permission

19:23.747 --> 19:25.999
to be who they really want to be.

19:31.171 --> 19:32.214
Do you dress up?

19:33.215 --> 19:35.008
Who were you last year?

19:35.926 --> 19:37.010
Me?

19:39.012 --> 19:40.973
I was a monster.

19:45.435 --> 19:47.062
Come on, Queenie.

19:48.313 --> 19:49.815
Come on.

19:50.315 --> 19:51.984
Come on, Queenie.

-(GASPS)
-Shh-shh-shh, it's okay.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.407
Hey.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.035
-Am I dead?
-No, honey, you're not dead.

20:03.412 --> 20:05.873
Let me get you a fresh towel.

20:16.550 --> 20:19.845
I don't know how to thank you
for saving my life.

20:20.762 --> 20:23.515
I guess you'll just have
to work on that then, huh?

20:34.359 --> 20:35.819
They're here.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.487
The girls are back?

20:38.071 --> 20:39.698
Not the girls.

(GATES CREAK)

21:00.135 --> 21:01.345
Wow.

21:03.263 --> 21:07.100
I had no idea the Council
would be joining us today.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.061
(WHISPERS) How screwed am I?

21:09.144 --> 21:10.354
Mmm, just breathe.

21:10.938 --> 21:14.650
Council on Witchcraft assembles
only under the gravest circumstances.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.236
And who doesn't love a surprise?

21:18.570 --> 21:19.738
I can guess why you're here.

21:21.448 --> 21:24.076
Last night's assault on Queenie
was a horrific tragedy,

21:24.159 --> 21:26.537
but I can assure you
she is resting comfortably.

21:27.788 --> 21:30.541
Assault? Elaborate, elucidate.

21:30.624 --> 21:32.251
I didn't see it myself, but...

21:32.334 --> 21:34.628
-By who?
-Well, what, actually.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.632
Something not altogether human.

21:38.715 --> 21:40.175
You should have alerted us at once.

21:40.259 --> 21:41.969
Yes, I was going to.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.930
I just... Yes.

21:45.681 --> 21:47.224
WITCH: That's not why we're here.

21:47.307 --> 21:50.269
Something potentially far more grave
has come to our attention.

21:50.602 --> 21:53.438
Oh, God. I should never
have gone over there.

21:53.522 --> 21:56.608
I'm sorry. I don't know
what I was thinking.

21:59.862 --> 22:00.946
Shit.

22:02.406 --> 22:05.367
You might as well know.
I went to Marie Laveau.

22:05.868 --> 22:08.328
But it was never my intention
to violate the truce.

22:08.412 --> 22:11.290
I see, well, perhaps
we should all sit down.

22:11.957 --> 22:14.418
Actually, don't get too comfortable.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.837
And you? Stop talking.

22:17.671 --> 22:20.174
Fiona, it's been a long time.

22:20.632 --> 22:24.344
Oh, Myrtle Snow. Look at you.

for a girl to get her phone call returned?

Oh, my life is pure torment.

One book signing after another.
Travel, travel, travel.

22:42.196 --> 22:44.907
It's like get me off
of the bestseller list already.

22:45.616 --> 22:49.036
Just remember whose magic it was
that put you there.

22:49.119 --> 22:51.580

(CHUCKLES) So,

23:01.882 --> 23:03.383
you old hens...

23:05.052 --> 23:06.887
What have you come to cluck about?

23:06.970 --> 23:10.098
We were summoned
by one of your students.

23:11.934 --> 23:13.143
Which one?

23:13.227 --> 23:14.770
NAN: Me.

23:16.980 --> 23:19.233
I can't hear her anymore.

23:19.733 --> 23:22.319
Madison? I think she's dead.

23:26.031 --> 23:28.158
That's why we're here.

23:40.879 --> 23:44.424
Let the record show the official inquiry
into the disappearance

23:44.508 --> 23:48.095
of our sister witch Madison Montgomery
has commenced.

23:48.178 --> 23:49.179
Noted.

MYRTLE: And the penalty
for inflicting grievous bodily harm

23:52.558 --> 23:55.602

can be but one...

23:55.686 --> 23:57.271
Death by fire.

23:58.272 --> 23:59.648
Miss Foxx?

23:59.731 --> 24:02.234
When was the last time
you saw or spoke with Madison?

24:02.651 --> 24:05.153
Yesterday. Madison is a spirited girl.

24:05.237 --> 24:08.031
The fact that she stayed out all night
is hardly a shocker.

24:08.115 --> 24:10.617
So it's not unusual
for you to lose track of your charges

24:10.701 --> 24:12.244
for extended periods of time?

24:12.327 --> 24:13.829
No, that's not...

24:15.706 --> 24:16.999
Do you read <i>TMZ?</i>

24:17.541 --> 24:19.251
Madison's already spent more time with us

24:19.334 --> 24:21.920
than at any rehab facility
she's been sentenced to.

24:22.004 --> 24:23.589
She's a special case.

24:23.672 --> 24:27.593
Did she give the impression of being
a particularly powerful witch?

24:28.093 --> 24:30.721
I mean, she's a movie star.
So she's got that thing, you know?

24:30.804 --> 24:33.140
No, we don't. What thing?

24:33.557 --> 24:37.019
That thing you lack, darling. Charisma.

24:38.604 --> 24:40.981
Madison Montgomery
is a stone-cold bitch

24:41.064 --> 24:44.693
who loves hard drinking,
big dicks and trouble.

24:44.776 --> 24:47.112
If she's dead,
it's probably 'cause she got wasted

24:47.196 --> 24:50.032
and offered the Grim Reaper
a hand job or something.

24:50.115 --> 24:51.408
(SLURPING)

24:52.117 --> 24:56.038
Before her disappearance,
was Madison manifesting any powers,

24:56.121 --> 24:58.832
new ones, rapidly accumulating?

24:59.374 --> 25:00.626
CORDELIA: <i>New powers? No.</i>

25:00.709 --> 25:04.463
Mostly we were concentrating
on helping her control her telekinesis,

25:04.546 --> 25:06.006
not developing new skills.

25:06.840 --> 25:07.966
Where's my rug?

25:08.926 --> 25:11.970
NAN: Yeah, she had powers all right.
Lots of them.

25:12.054 --> 25:14.097
She set the neighbor's curtains on fire.

25:14.181 --> 25:15.557
How did she do that?

25:15.849 --> 25:18.227
By looking at them.
It was awesome.

25:19.686 --> 25:20.812
Who else knew about this?

25:29.488 --> 25:31.323
(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

25:36.787 --> 25:38.455
You brought soup?

25:38.747 --> 25:40.666
There's a vending machine
in the lobby.

25:40.749 --> 25:43.293
It sells all kinds of stuff. Soup...

Can you imagine?
I mean, in my town,

25:51.260 --> 25:55.180
all you could get from a vending machine
was pop and Reese's.

25:55.806 --> 25:58.058
I was in a place in San Diego once

25:58.141 --> 26:01.019
where they had sushi
in the vending machines.

26:01.103 --> 26:02.813
The raw fish stuff?

26:03.355 --> 26:05.816
That sounds disgusting
even when it's fresh.

26:05.899 --> 26:07.192
(LAUGHS)

26:08.402 --> 26:10.362
I always wanted to go to San Diego.

26:10.445 --> 26:12.114
See the zoo.

26:12.197 --> 26:13.532
You're quite the world traveler.

26:14.825 --> 26:17.244
Work takes me
to some pretty cool places.

26:17.327 --> 26:18.495
And some crappy ones, too.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.385
You getting possessive already?

26:33.468 --> 26:37.598
No. No, I know you.
I know you're not like that.

26:45.105 --> 26:48.275
To think I found you
in an online community

26:48.358 --> 26:51.236
dedicated to collecting
Thomas Kinkade paintings.

-(MUSIC GROWS LOUDER)
-Hey, to be fair, I found you.

26:55.282 --> 26:56.450
Yeah.

26:57.534 --> 26:58.869
You played it smart, though.

27:00.412 --> 27:03.207
It was like you knew you had me
before I even responded.

27:04.583 --> 27:07.377
Other guys online
come on so strong, so fast.

27:07.461 --> 27:10.088
It's like, 10 minutes in
and they want to see

27:10.172 --> 27:12.424
a picture of my boobs
or something.

27:13.884 --> 27:17.179
You were cool as a cucumber.

27:27.940 --> 27:29.608
I really like you.

27:32.653 --> 27:34.154
Is that a problem?

27:34.821 --> 27:37.157
It is if you're gonna break my heart.

27:37.741 --> 27:38.867
Mmm.

27:43.622 --> 27:44.748
(SILENCED GUNSHOT)

27:51.547 --> 27:53.340
You must think you're very clever.

27:53.841 --> 27:56.218
I do. I do think I'm very clever.

27:57.219 --> 27:59.012
I am, after all, the Supreme.

27:59.888 --> 28:01.473
Sadly, you are.

28:01.849 --> 28:04.518
Though given the state of this coven
and this school,

28:04.601 --> 28:06.103
one could be forgiven for thinking

28:06.186 --> 28:08.689
we've been without a Supreme
for the past 40 years.

28:09.064 --> 28:11.692
If you don't like the way I run things,

28:12.818 --> 28:14.278
take it up with the Council.

28:14.778 --> 28:18.615
But that's just it.
You don't run things, you run off.

28:19.032 --> 28:21.994
You were absent
from last year's Summit Gathering,

28:22.077 --> 28:24.705
three Winter Petitions remain unsigned,

28:24.788 --> 28:28.625
and you've failed to appoint
a new Chancellor in over a decade.

28:28.959 --> 28:30.836
Has it been that long?

28:30.919 --> 28:33.714
The role of Supreme
is more than a figurehead.

28:33.797 --> 28:36.341
You must be present
for the betterment of our people,

28:36.425 --> 28:40.846
not just off jet-setting around the globe
to sate your vulgar, licentious appetites.

28:40.929 --> 28:42.055
You go!

28:42.139 --> 28:43.932
What's your point, Myrt?

28:44.016 --> 28:46.685
Why now, Fiona?
Why come back now?

28:46.768 --> 28:48.061
I'm sorry.

28:49.188 --> 28:52.191
I'm either confused or really bored,

28:53.358 --> 28:56.862
but am I a rotten Supreme
because I stayed away

28:58.780 --> 29:00.115
or because I came back?

29:00.199 --> 29:02.075
This is the second time
while you were under this roof

29:02.159 --> 29:04.411
that a witch has gone
missing from this place.

29:04.494 --> 29:05.621
And in both instances,

29:05.704 --> 29:08.081
you were the last one
to see either one of them alive.

29:08.165 --> 29:11.126
(CRYING) Please. She...
She's still alive.

29:11.877 --> 29:13.378
She has to be.

29:13.462 --> 29:15.964
WOMAN: We all grieve Anna Leigh, Fiona.

29:16.381 --> 29:19.760
But together, none of the witches
or warlocks of the Council

29:19.843 --> 29:21.553
can detect her life force.

29:22.721 --> 29:24.348
We must assume the worst.

29:26.558 --> 29:29.853
You say she was heading somewhere
when she spoke to you.

29:31.063 --> 29:33.982
Did she give you any indication
as to where?

29:36.818 --> 29:39.154
But she took a fine bottle of wine
with her.

29:40.239 --> 29:42.783
She said it was
a final peace offering.

29:44.660 --> 29:49.081
Anna Leigh recently negotiated a truce
with Marie Laveau, the voodoo queen.

29:50.207 --> 29:53.335
You don't suspect
the colored witches are involved in this?

29:54.336 --> 29:55.754
I couldn't say.

29:57.339 --> 29:58.382
(SOBS)

29:59.550 --> 30:00.634
Gather yourself, girl.

30:01.927 --> 30:04.513
You need to reach deep
and exercise your strength now.

30:07.015 --> 30:08.350

This Thursday night,
at the start of the full moon,

Fiona Goode will begin the tests
of the Seven Wonders.

30:36.837 --> 30:41.133
From time immemorial, our great people
has chosen to uphold and uplift

30:41.216 --> 30:44.428
one among us who was
born destined to lead.

30:44.511 --> 30:47.264
Can you believe it?
Fiona Goode.

30:48.307 --> 30:50.976
She'll end up being
the youngest Supreme in history.

30:51.059 --> 30:52.895
I can't believe
she's getting away with it.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.272
Getting away with what, dogface?

30:56.440 --> 30:57.608
Murder.

30:57.691 --> 31:01.320
...persecution, adversity.
A witch supreme in power

who can heal us
and make us whole...

I'm a Guardian of Veracity
in the Vernacular.

31:07.993 --> 31:11.538

By this time tomorrow,
we'll have a new Supreme.

31:56.500 --> 32:00.379
You notice how Spalding spends his life
cleaning up Fiona's messes?

32:00.462 --> 32:04.132
If Fiona did do something terrible
to Anna Leigh, Spalding knows about it.

32:06.969 --> 32:09.638
If Spalding does know something,
he's not talking.

32:10.055 --> 32:11.306
He's not going to have a choice.

32:11.932 --> 32:15.519
I enchanted his tongue
so it's incapable of speaking a lie.

32:15.602 --> 32:16.645
And I happen to know

32:16.728 --> 32:19.439
the Council is calling him
for a closed session tomorrow morning.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.451
Thank you, Spalding.

(GROANING CONTINUES)

33:08.530 --> 33:11.867
The time has come for you to pay
for every crime you've committed.

33:12.910 --> 33:15.245
I'm innocent until proven guilty.

33:15.412 --> 33:19.541
And so far, you have not proven
one goddamn thing.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.084
The Council reminds you,

33:21.168 --> 33:25.881
no witch has been tried, convicted,
and burned at the stake since 1926.

33:26.381 --> 33:29.009
And on a personal note, I'd like to add,

33:29.384 --> 33:32.137
I've got a book of matches
in my pocket, Fiona,

33:32.221 --> 33:34.681
and I'm just dying
to light this fire.

33:35.474 --> 33:36.558
Leave it in!

33:41.104 --> 33:44.691
I'd like to call our final witness,
Spalding.

33:46.902 --> 33:48.278
Stand before us.

33:56.286 --> 33:59.122
40 years ago,
our Supreme disappeared.

33:59.540 --> 34:02.417
Shortly thereafter, you were mutilated.

34:02.501 --> 34:05.963
Some call it coincidence,
others call it mystery.

34:06.046 --> 34:09.800
As to me, I can't imagine
living under the same roof

34:09.883 --> 34:12.344
as the monster who dismembered me,

34:12.427 --> 34:15.055
making her breakfast, pouring her tea.

34:15.931 --> 34:19.059
But you have nothing
to be afraid of now.

34:19.309 --> 34:20.978
Justice is so near.

34:21.854 --> 34:27.317
All you have to do
is write the name of the witch

34:27.401 --> 34:30.070
who was responsible
for severing your tongue.

35:21.038 --> 35:23.207
MYRTLE: He's not going to have a choice.

35:23.290 --> 35:26.210
I enchanted his tongue
so it's incapable of speaking a lie,

35:26.293 --> 35:28.086

the Council's calling him

This will not stand!

36:39.533 --> 36:44.621
You killed Anna Leigh
because she was the last Supreme!

36:44.955 --> 36:48.917
And you killed an innocent girl
because she was the next Supreme!

36:49.001 --> 36:50.919
You got away with it!

36:51.003 --> 36:52.838
She keeps getting away with it!

36:53.005 --> 36:55.048
CORDELIA: You're wrong.

36:56.300 --> 36:58.760
You think my mother killed
Madison Montgomery

36:58.844 --> 37:00.637
so she could remain the Supreme?

37:00.721 --> 37:03.932
Yes! You're blind to the ways
of your mother, chicky!

37:04.224 --> 37:05.642
You always have been!

37:06.268 --> 37:08.604
Madison wasn't the next Supreme.

<i>she kept it secret.</i>

37:24.411 --> 37:25.913
So I'm sorry, Myrtle.

37:26.538 --> 37:29.541
For 40 years, you've been
barking up the wrong tree.

37:30.459 --> 37:33.003
My mother is the Supreme
for a reason.

Then why can't I hear her?

Maybe she found a way
to keep you out of her head.

39:10.100 --> 39:11.143
I know I've been trying.

39:11.602 --> 39:13.478
No. She passed.
