WEBVTT

00:01.252 --> 00:03.170
<i>Previously
on Designated Survivor...</i>

00:03.295 --> 00:06.340
That there was a plan to make sure
Congressman Peter MacLeish survived.

00:06.465 --> 00:07.633
They built a bomb shelter.

00:07.758 --> 00:10.136
- Speaker of the House?
- We think you'd be the obvious choice.

00:10.261 --> 00:12.304
I'm honored.
I just don't want the job.

00:12.430 --> 00:13.973
Maybe we offered him
the wrong job.

00:14.098 --> 00:16.308
What about the Vice Presidency?

00:16.434 --> 00:19.311
Does Leo know... that the President
might not be his father?

00:19.437 --> 00:20.688
It's been a whole week

00:20.813 --> 00:22.481
since Nassar confessed
to the Capitol bombing.

00:22.606 --> 00:23.774
Where are we on our search?

00:23.899 --> 00:26.986
Recent NSA chatter indicates new attacks,
both at home and abroad.

00:27.111 --> 00:30.197
Nassar could prove to be an extremely
valuable source of intelligence.

00:30.322 --> 00:31.991
Put down your guns!

00:33.617 --> 00:34.952
We have Majid Nassar.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.521
Notify. No one coming down now.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.022
<i>According to the White House,</i>

01:04.147 --> 01:05.649
<i>shortly after 11:00 P.M.,</i>

01:05.775 --> 01:08.152
<i>a team of Navy SEALs
launched a daring raid</i>

01:08.277 --> 01:10.529
<i>into a compound
in Southern Algeria.</i>

01:10.654 --> 01:13.866
<i>While taking great care
to avoid civilian casualties,</i>

01:13.991 --> 01:16.702
<i>the SEALs exchanged gunfire
with the enemy, and in the end...</i>

01:16.827 --> 01:17.828
Here you go.

01:17.953 --> 01:20.331
<i>...Majid Nassar,
the alleged mastermind</i>

01:20.456 --> 01:21.999
<i>behind the Capitol bombing,
was captured.</i>

01:22.124 --> 01:23.751
- Heads up.
<i>- Military officials declined</i>

01:23.876 --> 01:25.711
<i>to disclose
where Nassar is being held,</i>

01:25.836 --> 01:28.506
<i>but confirmed he remains
under heavy security.</i>

01:28.631 --> 01:31.884
<i>After a video showing Nassar
taking credit for the attacks...</i>

01:32.009 --> 01:34.261
Military Intelligence
keeps working on Nassar,

01:34.386 --> 01:36.180
and, still,
he hasn't said a word.

01:36.305 --> 01:37.932
Is there a timetable
for this sort of thing?

01:38.057 --> 01:39.391
When can we expect some results?

01:39.517 --> 01:41.060
Well, maybe today.
Maybe tomorrow.

01:41.185 --> 01:42.561
Maybe never.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.772
We lost a good man
bringing Nassar back alive.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.398
We better get something for it.

01:46.524 --> 01:49.360
Well, sir, let's focus on the positive.
The Nassar raid is a win.

01:49.485 --> 01:50.736
Your approval numbers ticked up
another two--

01:50.861 --> 01:53.197
- I don't care...
- He doesn't care about approval numbers.

01:53.531 --> 01:55.741
Anne, you look lovely.

01:55.866 --> 01:56.909
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:57.034 --> 01:58.953
Look, sir, you may not care
about your approval numbers,

01:59.078 --> 02:01.080
but you need people's confidence
to be effective.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.248
I also need a Congress.

02:02.373 --> 02:04.708
Well, governors wouldn't be here
unless they wanted to give you one.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.253
And you're giving them a chance
to discuss their issues face-to-face.

02:07.378 --> 02:09.755
And they all showed up.
Maybe that's half the battle.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.216
Well,
the open bar should do the rest.

02:12.341 --> 02:13.425
First we'll appoint a Senate,

02:13.551 --> 02:15.427
then we'll get elections
on the books for a House.

02:15.553 --> 02:17.763
Remember, sir, they need
this to work as much as you do.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.598
Without a House,
there is no federal budget.

02:19.723 --> 02:22.810
The VA closes, farmers lose subsidies,
public schools don't get funding.

02:22.935 --> 02:25.563
Plus, no one wants to be responsible
for not bringing this country together.

02:25.688 --> 02:26.564
Looking sharp, sir.

02:26.689 --> 02:29.817
Apparently I clean up pretty well.
You coming with us to this thing?

02:29.942 --> 02:32.069
No, sir. I'm done for the evening.
About to head out.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.445
Nice. Big plans?

02:33.571 --> 02:36.115
Bowling with my brother
and his in-laws,

02:36.240 --> 02:37.783
so... no.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.243
Good luck
with the governors, sir.

02:39.577 --> 02:41.162
- Thanks, Mike.
- Yeah.

02:41.287 --> 02:43.789
Also, sir, when you meet Governor Rivera,
remember to thank him.

02:43.914 --> 02:46.250
He stepped up to accept
a plane full of Syrian refugees.

02:46.375 --> 02:47.793
It's scheduled to land
in Miami tomorrow.

02:47.918 --> 02:48.961
Okay.

02:55.426 --> 02:57.094
Stop it.

02:58.596 --> 02:59.930
You look breathtaking.

03:00.055 --> 03:00.973
Nice haircut.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.100
- Contacts, too.
- Mm-hmm.

03:03.225 --> 03:04.935
I don't even
recognize you anymore.

03:07.229 --> 03:08.522
Hey.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.316
You think I'm wrong hosting a dinner

03:10.441 --> 03:12.151
this soon after the Capitol attack?

03:12.276 --> 03:16.530
You can't invite 50 governors to D.C.
and take them to Golden Corral.

03:18.449 --> 03:19.783
I like Golden Corral.

03:26.749 --> 03:29.168
So, the White House is riding high
on this Nassar news.

03:29.293 --> 03:30.502
What's the goal now?

03:30.628 --> 03:33.047
Well, the goal is to rebuild,
starting with a full Senate

03:33.172 --> 03:34.715
that can confirm the president's cabinet.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.801
And what's the plan for that, exactly?

03:40.638 --> 03:42.473
Sorry, uh, who are you with?

03:42.598 --> 03:44.099
I came alone.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.395
<i>The Chronicle.</i> Lisa Jordan.
New White House correspondent.

03:48.520 --> 03:52.983
Right. Look, our hope is that before the
governors leave at the end of the week,

03:53.108 --> 03:54.485
that they'll submit appointments
for the Senate

03:54.610 --> 03:56.028
and agree to special House elections.

03:56.153 --> 03:57.154
And the cabinet?

03:57.279 --> 03:58.572
Does the president
have nominees in mind?

03:58.697 --> 04:00.491
The President of the United States.

04:00.616 --> 04:02.159
O'Neil, I'll get back to you.
Our host is here.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.252
Way to enter a room.

04:11.377 --> 04:12.711
Stick with me, kid.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.214
Hey. Great to see you.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.675
Congressman MacLeish.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.551
Mr. Shore.

04:19.677 --> 04:22.012
Ms. Rhodes. How are you?

04:22.137 --> 04:23.889
Ah, that depends on how tonight goes.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.350
Indeed. You know my wife, Beth.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.518
- Hi. Nice to see you.
- Ma'am.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.103
Um, excuse me.
I'm gonna get a drink.

04:29.228 --> 04:33.274
All right. Guys, I did want to just say,
I hope you made it clear to the president

04:33.399 --> 04:35.693
I was saying no to the job of speaker,
not to him.

04:35.818 --> 04:37.111
He knows.

04:37.236 --> 04:39.196
And there's another way
for you to serve,

04:39.321 --> 04:40.739
if you're interested.

04:40.864 --> 04:42.866
Hypothetically speaking, of course,

04:43.534 --> 04:45.244
how does vice president
sound to you?

04:48.205 --> 04:49.331
Hypothetically speaking?

04:52.876 --> 04:54.837
I-I would be honored.

04:55.713 --> 04:56.714
Thank you for coming.

04:56.839 --> 04:58.590
Thank you for coming tonight.
You look lovely.

04:58.716 --> 05:01.051
- Good to see you again.
- Governor Rivera, great to see you.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.761
- My pleasure, sir.
- Great to see you.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.054
- How are you?
- My pleasure.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.222
Thank you for being here tonight.

05:05.347 --> 05:06.765
Mr. President.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.058
Governor Chris Nichols. Arizona.

05:08.183 --> 05:09.768
Governor Nichols. What a pleasure.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.645
Thank you for coming
to Washington, D.C.

05:11.770 --> 05:14.481
Oh, this is a great opportunity
for us to get to know each other.

05:14.606 --> 05:16.108
I couldn't agree with you more.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.152
While I have you,
perhaps we can find some time

05:18.277 --> 05:19.903
to discuss what happened
with Governor Royce.

05:20.529 --> 05:22.489
That was a very difficult situation.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.450
Yes, yes,
I'm sure you can understand

05:24.575 --> 05:28.579
how disconcerting it was for me
to see one of my colleagues arrested.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.122
Of course I understand,
but, unfortunately,

05:30.247 --> 05:31.582
Governor Royce
didn't give me much choice.

05:31.707 --> 05:33.625
Mr. President, it's time.

05:33.751 --> 05:34.918
Excuse me.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.551
Perks of a promotion, huh?

05:44.553 --> 05:45.804
You gonna talk to her or what?

05:45.929 --> 05:47.431
No-fly zone, man.
She's press.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.475
Come on. This is D.C.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.935
Hours you work,
who else are you gonna meet?

05:52.311 --> 05:53.437
Good evening, everyone.

05:54.563 --> 05:57.900
To begin, I simply want to thank all
of you for being here tonight.

05:58.567 --> 06:02.112
Recently, our country was devastated
by an unspeakable attack,

06:02.237 --> 06:03.989
and yet I can't think

06:04.114 --> 06:07.451
of a more fitting way
to honor our fallen colleagues

06:07.576 --> 06:10.162
than by re-dedicating ourselves

06:10.287 --> 06:13.165
to the values and ideals
of this great nation.

06:13.624 --> 06:17.669
I am not the president
you or the rest of the country voted for.

06:17.795 --> 06:20.631
But I have to believe that
we all want the same thing:

06:20.756 --> 06:23.675
to rebuild the Capitol,
the Congress, the Senate...

06:24.760 --> 06:26.929
...to rebuild our country.

06:27.346 --> 06:28.514
I can't do it alone.

06:28.639 --> 06:30.974
Nor would I ever want to.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.728
I can't help but smile
at the irony of that,

06:34.853 --> 06:38.357
because, well,
I'm a registered Independent.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.572
It's nice to hear
some laughter for a change.

06:45.697 --> 06:48.200
But the truth is,
I believe, as an Independent,

06:48.325 --> 06:52.746
I have a unique opportunity
to effect positive political change,

06:52.871 --> 06:56.333
that I can help bridge the divide.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.585
And together,
we can find the common ground

06:58.710 --> 07:01.713
that has been missing in the American
political landscape for years.

07:04.049 --> 07:06.552
If we do this,
if we work together,

07:06.677 --> 07:09.263
I promise you we will be
stronger and better than ever.

07:09.388 --> 07:12.015
This is how we are gonna honor
the incredible sacrifice--

07:13.183 --> 07:14.518
Everybody down!

07:16.353 --> 07:17.604
Alex!

07:19.064 --> 07:20.774
Shots fired outside the East Wing.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.901
- Alex!
- Go!

07:23.026 --> 07:23.902
Down! Down!

07:34.913 --> 07:37.291
I was on my way home,
heard the shots. Talk to me.

07:37.416 --> 07:40.043
We believe there's only one gunman.
We've tracked him into the park.

07:40.169 --> 07:41.128
- The president?
- Safe.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.547
The whole family's locked down
in the residence. No one injured.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.175
You two,
you're with me. Let's move.

08:11.575 --> 08:14.495
Agent down. Repeat, agent down.
Lafayette Park.

08:18.624 --> 08:20.626
Mike. Mike.

08:20.751 --> 08:21.793
Stay with me.

08:23.045 --> 08:26.131
I'm sorry, sir. We're still on lock-down.
You need to stay in the White House.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.592
I get that I can't go to the hospital,
but can someone please

08:28.717 --> 08:30.010
get me an update
on Mike's condition?

08:30.135 --> 08:31.303
I'm on the phone
with the hospital now.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.639
- Thank you.
- Well, what about all the governors?

08:33.764 --> 08:35.933
They'll be escorted back to their hotels
as soon as it's safe.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.518
That was
the chief of surgery at GW.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.437
Agent Ritter was hit twice.
Kevlar vest stopped the first bullet,

08:40.562 --> 08:42.606
but the second one penetrated
his axillary artery.

08:42.731 --> 08:45.275
- They're prepping him for surgery now.
- Oh, my God.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.485
I-I just saw him.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.820
He was going home
to spend time with his family.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.197
I know.

08:50.322 --> 08:51.990
I'm sure he's in the best hands.

08:52.491 --> 08:55.160
- I got to go check on the kids.
- Of course. Please.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.455
Can you explain to me how they got
close enough to shoot at the White House?

08:58.580 --> 09:00.666
AR-15. Range of 1,800 feet.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.125
Luckily, the windows are bulletproof.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.836
Sir, we have an update on the shooter.
His name is Murad Yamadayev.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.547
He's a Chechen national.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.173
- Is he in custody?
- No, sir. He's dead.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.008
Agent Ritter got him
before he went down.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.969
And do we know
why he did this?

09:12.094 --> 09:14.054
Three minutes before
firing on the White House,

09:14.179 --> 09:15.847
Yamadayev took to social media,

09:15.973 --> 09:19.434
pledged his allegiance to Majid Nassar.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.145
Oh, my God.

09:23.480 --> 09:26.775
Al-Sakar's shown us they can attack
the Capitol, the White House.

09:27.985 --> 09:29.528
What's next?

09:34.783 --> 09:36.159
I have to be honest.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.663
It's looking like bringing Nassar back
alive was more of a liability

09:39.788 --> 09:42.207
- than an asset.
- Sir, I appreciate your frustration,

09:42.332 --> 09:44.710
- but effective interrogation takes time.
- No, we don't have time.

09:44.835 --> 09:47.879
How many more terrorists
like Murad Yamadayev are out there?

09:48.005 --> 09:51.216
If there are cells within the country,
we need to know before they hit us again.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.343
Sir, I believe we can
get answers more quickly

09:53.468 --> 09:56.096
if you were willing to consider
removing him from U.S. soil

09:56.221 --> 09:58.223
to a black site
for enhanced interrogation.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.933
My men can be extremely persuasive.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.894
Mr. President, enhanced interrogation
does not work.

10:03.020 --> 10:05.355
Nassar will tell you
whatever you want to hear.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.065
That is your opinion.

10:07.190 --> 10:10.736
We have extracted actionable intel
that has headed off multiple threats.

10:10.861 --> 10:12.112
Yeah, what about Abu Zubydah?

10:12.237 --> 10:13.572
- What about him?
- We had him first.

10:13.697 --> 10:14.948
We used rapport-based questioning.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.409
We got names, dates, resources,

10:17.534 --> 10:20.912
turned him over to the agency,
where you waterboarded him 83 times

10:21.038 --> 10:22.247
and got nothing but gibberish.

10:22.372 --> 10:23.415
- That is one--
- An unconfirmed--

10:23.540 --> 10:25.208
Gentlemen, a black site is not an option.

10:25.334 --> 10:26.752
Deputy Director Atwood,

10:26.877 --> 10:28.295
you believe
you can make progress?

10:28.420 --> 10:29.796
Yes, sir. I do.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.381
You've got 24 hours.

10:36.511 --> 10:39.056
Tell whoever's running scheduling
that I want to see the "ten day book"

10:39.181 --> 10:41.600
for the president, and have Aaron find me
when he comes back.

10:43.352 --> 10:44.394
Mr. Atwood.

10:45.062 --> 10:47.230
Ms. Rhodes.
What can I do for you?

10:47.356 --> 10:49.566
I was gonna call you,
but since I've caught you,

10:49.691 --> 10:52.611
we would like to begin the formal
vetting process on a VP candidate.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.613
Sure. I can get the ball rolling.
Who is it?

10:54.738 --> 10:56.156
Congressman Peter MacLeish.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.783
I'd appreciate
if you could have your team

10:57.908 --> 11:00.285
forward all relevant research
to myself and the chief of staff.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.079
You know, with all the recent events,

11:02.204 --> 11:03.246
it's gonna take some time.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.415
I understand that, but this is
a priority for the president,

11:05.540 --> 11:07.167
so anything you can do
to speed it along.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.086
- Will do.
- Emily Rhodes.

11:11.213 --> 11:12.923
I'll let the president know right away.

11:14.049 --> 11:14.841
Yes, Doctor.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.301
Thank you. Goodbye.

11:17.761 --> 11:18.679
Mike's out of surgery.

11:18.804 --> 11:20.472
Doctor said it went well.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.641
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

11:24.810 --> 11:27.479
I wanted to tell you,
I-I kept the kids home today.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.441
- They're still scared?
- We're all still scared.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.612
Tom, was he shooting at <i>you?</i>

11:36.446 --> 11:40.117
Honestly, from that far away...

11:41.451 --> 11:43.578
...I think he was trying
to hit anything he could.

11:44.454 --> 11:47.666
Secret Service has raised security
for you and the kids across the board.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.168
They've extended the perimeter
around the White House.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.546
Hopefully, that'll reassure the governors.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.756
They're supposed to come back soon.

11:56.842 --> 11:58.301
Hey, hey.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.222
I'm sorry to interrupt.
We have a problem.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.808
I just got word that the plane
carrying the Syrian refugees

12:04.933 --> 12:07.477
has landed in Miami,
but Governor Rivera won't let them off.

12:07.602 --> 12:08.478
What?

12:08.603 --> 12:10.147
The governors
are due back in an hour.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.816
See if you can get Governor Rivera here
before the rest of them.

12:12.941 --> 12:14.526
- I'm on it.
- Thanks, Em.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.991
- MacLeish?
- Yes.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.242
For VP?

12:22.367 --> 12:23.952
They want to start the vetting.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.830
Jason, you have to stall this process
until we can figure out

12:26.955 --> 12:27.998
how he fits into all this.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.085
When's the last time you heard

12:32.210 --> 12:34.755
from the mystery caller
that told you about room 105?

12:34.880 --> 12:36.214
Not since that night.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.094
I'll work on stalling the vetting,
but in the meantime,

12:41.219 --> 12:43.054
we still have Nassar to deal with.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.015
Military Intelligence gave it a shot.

12:45.140 --> 12:45.932
They got nothing.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.726
That's because Nassar didn't...

12:48.518 --> 12:50.771
- He didn't blow up the Capitol.
- That's exactly why we need you

12:50.896 --> 12:53.023
to get him to admit that
as soon as possible.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.195
Governor, thank you
for taking the time.

12:58.987 --> 13:02.407
I asked my wife to join us
because of her immigration-law expertise.

13:02.532 --> 13:05.452
Ah, yes, I saw Sunday's
"20/20" piece on you.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.871
It made my mom proud.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.080
Governor, two days ago,

13:09.206 --> 13:11.249
you gave permission
for a planeload of Syrian refugees

13:11.374 --> 13:12.751
to land in Florida, and now--

13:12.876 --> 13:16.129
That was before a Nassar sympathizer
fired on the White House.

13:16.254 --> 13:18.381
Today I have protests across my state.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.759
You and I both know that
the attack on the White House

13:20.884 --> 13:23.553
had absolutely nothing to do
with the people on that plane.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.597
Those refugees are not extremists.

13:25.722 --> 13:28.391
In fact, they came here to escape them.

13:29.392 --> 13:31.895
With all due respect, ma'am,
how can you be so sure?

13:32.562 --> 13:34.439
I mean, do we really know
who they are,

13:34.564 --> 13:36.608
whether or not
they have links to terrorism?

13:36.733 --> 13:40.403
Not one of those passengers
has been flagged by DHS.

13:41.238 --> 13:45.242
They've been checked and re-checked
against multiple watch lists.

13:45.367 --> 13:46.785
You'd find very few U.S. citizens

13:46.910 --> 13:48.411
who could pass that kind of scrutiny.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.914
They're from a failed state,

13:51.039 --> 13:52.290
a country in chaos.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.292
It's impossible to properly screen them.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.585
And you cannot guarantee

13:55.710 --> 13:58.296
that one of them
does not intend to harm us.

13:58.421 --> 14:00.340
Ma'am, the people of Florida are scared.

14:00.465 --> 14:04.636
Governor, in 1980,
Congress passed the Refugee Act,

14:04.761 --> 14:07.806
empowering the federal government
to place refugees across this country.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.933
Sir, that was, what, 36 years ago?

14:10.058 --> 14:11.142
Times have changed,

14:11.268 --> 14:12.853
and our country must change
with them.

14:12.978 --> 14:15.438
But change does not mean
that we abandon our principles.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.524
If we don't let these people
off the plane--

14:17.649 --> 14:18.942
You'll send in the Guard?

14:21.278 --> 14:22.153
Arrest me?

14:22.279 --> 14:24.781
- That's not what I was going to say.
- Please, Governor.

14:25.782 --> 14:28.994
Mrs. Kirkman,
I am not unsympathetic.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.829
In fact,
I'm the child of immigrants.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.498
But it's my job
to represent my people,

14:33.623 --> 14:35.834
not to impose my will on them.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.254
The answer is no.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.301
Well, Governor Rivera's
a reasonable man.

14:44.426 --> 14:48.013
A reasonable man keeping 300 refugees
detained on a plane.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.390
Well, he's under intense pressure
from his constituents. Give him time.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.392
- He'll come back to his senses.
- We don't have time.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.811
We need to find another state
to land this plane in now.

14:54.936 --> 14:55.812
Yes, sir.

14:55.937 --> 14:57.981
Mr. President, you need to focus
on getting back on track

14:58.106 --> 14:59.524
- with the governors.
- You know what? She's right.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.902
Let me make some calls to ICE,
see what I can find.

15:02.027 --> 15:02.903
Okay, thanks.

15:08.325 --> 15:09.242
Good morning, everyone.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.785
Please, sit.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.000
Given last night's events,

15:17.125 --> 15:19.252
I cannot begin to tell you
how grateful I am

15:19.377 --> 15:23.173
to see you all back here today,
because the work we have in front of us

15:23.298 --> 15:24.716
could not be more important.

15:24.841 --> 15:27.010
The rebuilding
of our Congress and our Senate

15:27.135 --> 15:31.056
to ensure that all American citizens
have a voice in all 50 states.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.390
- This--
- Excuse me, Mr. President,

15:32.515 --> 15:35.560
but with all due respect,
we can spend all day here

15:35.685 --> 15:37.896
talking about the issues that face us,

15:38.021 --> 15:41.733
but the fact is, we don't know
who we're discussing them <i>with.</i>

15:41.858 --> 15:44.152
- We don't know what you stand for.
- Sir.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.405
Governor Mennuti.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.532
Very nice to see you again.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.576
The president and I go way back.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.037
He's a fine man.

15:54.913 --> 15:58.041
But most of these governors
don't know you like I do, sir.

15:58.917 --> 16:01.920
I think this is the perfect
opportunity to change that.

16:02.921 --> 16:04.214
What do you suggest?

16:04.339 --> 16:05.882
Mr. President, your friend is right.

16:06.007 --> 16:08.134
If we're to recognize you

16:08.259 --> 16:10.261
as the legitimate leader of our nation,

16:10.387 --> 16:12.055
we need our minds put at ease.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.891
Answer our questions, all of them.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.811
And if we're satisfied
with what you have to say,

16:17.936 --> 16:19.604
you'll get your Senate appointees.

16:20.397 --> 16:22.607
With all due respect, Governor Nichols,

16:22.732 --> 16:24.109
I'm not on trial here.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.527
You are <i>now.</i>

16:33.451 --> 16:36.454
There is no other president in history
who'd agree to this inquisition.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.833
No president since Lincoln has faced
questions of his legitimacy.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.459
Enough.
I don't need a history lesson.

16:41.584 --> 16:42.752
This is about the future.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.754
If we don't get the governors
on board, it's over,

16:44.879 --> 16:47.090
and I'm not talking about
my presidency.

16:47.215 --> 16:49.676
I'm talking about
the country as we know it.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.721
Em, tell the governors I'll answer
whatever questions they want.

16:53.930 --> 16:54.806
Yes, sir.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.142
Sir, this is a fundamentally bad idea.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.519
The president does not answer
to state leadership.

16:59.644 --> 17:00.937
Then pretend I'm not the president.

17:01.062 --> 17:03.773
It seems to be working
for everybody else.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.109
Look, for the last time,
I have no new information

17:07.234 --> 17:10.320
concerning the interrogation of
Majid Nassar, including his whereabouts

17:10.446 --> 17:12.949
or any information that
he may or may not have provided

17:13.074 --> 17:14.284
and would have been classified.

17:14.409 --> 17:15.785
- Is there--
- Yes, Ms. Jordan?

17:16.618 --> 17:19.329
Rumor is Kirkman's on the verge
of losing the governors' support

17:19.455 --> 17:20.874
and a Senate in the process.
Any comment?

17:20.999 --> 17:22.291
Lisa, you know
I don't comment on rumors.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.794
Thank you very much, everyone.
That's all for now.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.467
Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.178
You are good at your job.

17:33.803 --> 17:36.347
Of course, the last press secretary
nearly drowned from flop sweat, so...

17:36.473 --> 17:38.475
...low bar.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.646
I may be way off-base here.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.149
Did we have a thing last night?

17:47.025 --> 17:48.068
A thing?

17:48.193 --> 17:50.236
Eyes locked. Crowded room.

17:50.361 --> 17:51.488
Uh...

17:51.821 --> 17:53.156
Did <i>you</i> think we had a thing?

17:53.281 --> 17:56.534
I did. But...
I'm romantic like that.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.828
I thought we had a thing, too. Uh...

17:59.704 --> 18:02.165
Um, it's just, um, you're, you know--

18:02.290 --> 18:03.541
Press.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.502
And you're press secretary,

18:05.627 --> 18:08.379
so you probably think
asking me out would be...

18:08.505 --> 18:10.048
A lapse in judgment.

18:10.173 --> 18:13.384
Well, then, since you answer
my questions for a living,

18:13.510 --> 18:15.303
why don't I make it easy for you?

18:16.721 --> 18:18.848
Feel like having a drink
with me tonight?

18:22.060 --> 18:24.562
I need statistics
on resettlement programs

18:24.687 --> 18:27.107
in the states with the largest
refugee populations,

18:27.232 --> 18:29.234
so Texas, California, New York.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.402
Mrs. Kirkman, a moment, please?

18:31.528 --> 18:33.363
I'll catch up with you.

18:33.488 --> 18:34.781
Yeah?

18:34.906 --> 18:36.282
Ma'am,

18:36.407 --> 18:37.784
your husband's position
with the governors

18:37.909 --> 18:39.410
- is rather delicate right now.
- Mm-hmm.

18:39.536 --> 18:40.411
And it's my belief that--

18:40.537 --> 18:42.163
You don't want me
to rock the boat.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.582
In a manner of speaking, yes.

18:44.707 --> 18:45.708
Nor do I.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.919
But there are 300 Syrian refugees

18:48.044 --> 18:50.213
being denied basic human rights
in our country.

18:50.338 --> 18:53.258
This isn't a political issue.
It's more of a humanitarian one.

18:53.383 --> 18:55.927
All due respect, ma'am,
but everything is political.

18:56.052 --> 18:58.596
What do you want me to do?
Sit down and shut up?

18:58.721 --> 18:59.931
No, I-I didn't say that.

19:00.056 --> 19:03.059
Yes, you did, and that's okay
'cause that's your job, but here is mine.

19:03.184 --> 19:04.936
As a wife of 17 years

19:05.061 --> 19:06.938
and an immigration attorney of 22,

19:07.063 --> 19:09.941
I am gonna counsel
my husband through this.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.277
And if there is a political fallout,

19:12.402 --> 19:14.404
then I trust that you can handle it.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.170
The prisoner will be shackled
throughout the interview.

19:30.295 --> 19:31.462
If you need assistance,

19:31.588 --> 19:34.132
guards will be stationed
outside the interview room.

19:34.632 --> 19:37.135
Chow time.
Guess your guy will have to wait.

19:40.263 --> 19:41.306
There'll be no video.

19:41.431 --> 19:43.099
They're keeping your name
off the log.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.768
We've got one shot.
Don't waste it.

19:46.394 --> 19:47.478
I won't.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.147
We have less than 24 hours.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.149
Prisoner is being transported now.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.738
Keep walking.

19:57.405 --> 19:58.406
Behind you.

20:32.815 --> 20:33.858
He's all yours.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.660
All right, tell you
how this is gonna go.

20:43.785 --> 20:45.870
We're gonna ask you some questions.
You're gonna answer them.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.705
The sooner you do,
the sooner we'll be done.

20:47.830 --> 20:50.875
If you do not wish to speak to us,
other arrangements can be made.

20:52.168 --> 20:53.211
Look at me.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.505
Look at me.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.384
First, I want to make sure
that you know your rights.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.094
You have the right to a lawyer.

21:01.219 --> 21:03.221
You have the right not to speak to us.

21:03.346 --> 21:06.432
You have the right
to humane treatment, to an appeal.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.434
You have the right
to confront your accuser.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.437
But only if you're here, in the U.S.

21:11.562 --> 21:15.024
We already have an extradition
request for you from Pakistan

21:15.149 --> 21:17.402
for a car bombing in Karachi.

21:17.527 --> 21:20.113
So, this is your last shot

21:20.238 --> 21:21.948
to talk in a comfortable,
seated position,

21:22.073 --> 21:24.659
because in Pakistan,
human rights are optional.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.036
Six years ago...

21:28.871 --> 21:30.581
U.S. Maverick missiles

21:30.707 --> 21:32.917
struck an apartment building
outside Barmal

21:33.042 --> 21:35.044
holding over 100 civilians,

21:35.169 --> 21:37.422
including my wife and two daughters.

21:37.547 --> 21:39.757
I spent seven days
sifting through the rubble

21:39.882 --> 21:41.426
hoping to find their remains.

21:41.551 --> 21:44.262
Searched day and night
and found nothing.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.223
I didn't sleep
for one second that week,

21:47.348 --> 21:48.725
nor the week after.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.060
So if you think
you can break me,

21:52.228 --> 21:54.230
I suggest
you re-evaluate your methods.

21:59.068 --> 22:01.904
<i>I understand that you all
have questions about me.</i>

22:02.030 --> 22:03.281
If I was in your position,

22:03.406 --> 22:05.116
I would probably
feel the same way.

22:05.241 --> 22:08.119
My only hope
is that when we are finished,

22:08.244 --> 22:10.496
that we can all
move forward together.

22:10.621 --> 22:12.081
Mr. President,

22:12.206 --> 22:14.792
would you consider yourself
an impulsive man?

22:16.461 --> 22:18.296
Uh, according to my wife, no.

22:19.797 --> 22:22.967
So, if you're not impulsive,
can you explain

22:23.092 --> 22:26.262
why you overhauled the Department
of Housing and Urban Development

22:26.387 --> 22:28.973
within weeks of your appointment
as HUD Secretary?

22:29.098 --> 22:30.767
Well, w-when I was appointed,

22:30.892 --> 22:34.645
it was expected that I would infuse
the department with fresh, new ideas.

22:34.771 --> 22:37.482
And so you just fired anyone
that didn't get on board?

22:37.607 --> 22:39.484
The department was stagnant.

22:39.609 --> 22:42.987
I needed community activist leaders,
not civil servants.

22:43.112 --> 22:45.823
President Richmond appointed me
to effect change.

22:45.948 --> 22:48.326
I did it in the most
efficient way possible.

22:48.451 --> 22:51.287
Speaking of change, sir,
why did you fire General Cochrane?

22:51.412 --> 22:54.123
Was he just a "civil servant" to you?

22:54.582 --> 22:56.125
The general was insubordinate.

22:56.959 --> 23:00.046
He advanced a military operation
without my authorization.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.464
And Governor Royce?

23:01.589 --> 23:02.673
I know him, sir.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.509
He is a good man.

23:04.634 --> 23:08.179
He may be, but what the governor did
was tantamount to sedition.

23:08.304 --> 23:09.847
I'm sorry, Mr. President.

23:09.972 --> 23:13.142
To be clear, the staffers
at HUD were complacent,

23:13.267 --> 23:16.813
Cochrane was insubordinate,
and Royce seditious.

23:17.480 --> 23:21.359
Perhaps, sir, you're just threatened
by people who disagree with you.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.861
<i>We know all about you.</i>

23:23.986 --> 23:26.364
You know, we've been tracking you
for a long time.

23:26.489 --> 23:27.824
College in Egypt.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.577
Selling Islamic banking systems
in Jordan.

23:31.702 --> 23:34.163
You came to the jihad dance
kind of late.

23:34.288 --> 23:36.541
The Taliban had
already moved to Pakistan.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.042
But you're
big-time now, right?

23:38.167 --> 23:40.670
Al Sakar brought down
the temple of democracy.

23:40.795 --> 23:43.047
Did something
no one thought was possible.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.049
And it's already fired up new recruits.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.968
One of them attacked
the White House last night.

23:47.802 --> 23:49.971
So, explain something to me.

23:50.847 --> 23:52.557
Up until now,

23:52.682 --> 23:55.685
Al Sakar has always been a leech.

23:56.185 --> 23:58.938
You just attach yourself
to bigger groups.

23:59.063 --> 24:00.606
In 2013,

24:00.731 --> 24:02.733
you took credit for
the Rabat night club bombing,

24:02.859 --> 24:04.819
when it was actually AQIM
that did it.

24:06.863 --> 24:08.823
You want to know
what the truth is?

24:09.407 --> 24:11.909
You don't have the skills
to pull off something

24:12.034 --> 24:13.911
as complicated as the Capitol attack.

24:14.412 --> 24:15.580
Do you?

24:19.876 --> 24:22.753
Anti-tank mines
with Cyrillic on the outside.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.548
Pakistani lock rings.

24:26.424 --> 24:28.259
Iranian firing pins.

24:28.384 --> 24:30.261
Someone fed me that info, too.

24:30.386 --> 24:32.263
You think
a small-time organization

24:32.388 --> 24:34.557
can get their hands on such mines
in such quantities?

24:35.057 --> 24:38.352
We blew up your Capitol
and brought it to the ground.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.438
No one else.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.692
<i>In defense
of President Kirkman,</i>

24:45.234 --> 24:47.987
I would like to point out
that in a few short weeks,

24:48.112 --> 24:51.073
under the most unyielding
of circumstances,

24:51.199 --> 24:53.409
not only did he ascertain the identity

24:53.534 --> 24:56.787
of the group behind the bombing,
but oversaw the operation

24:56.913 --> 24:59.790
which led to the swift capture
of the mastermind himself.

24:59.916 --> 25:02.960
I'm sorry, but that was good intelligence
and good operations.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.795
It wouldn't have mattered
who was in the White House.

25:04.921 --> 25:07.423
The fact remains that President Kirkman
has no credentials,

25:07.548 --> 25:10.301
no accomplishments,
no real experience.

25:10.426 --> 25:11.969
Exactly.

25:12.094 --> 25:14.430
As much as we can appreciate
the position you're in,

25:14.555 --> 25:18.100
I just can't get behind the fact that
you're the president simply because

25:18.226 --> 25:20.186
you were the Designated Survivor.

25:20.311 --> 25:23.147
Everyone here knows
what that means.

25:23.272 --> 25:25.858
It wasn't an honor.
You were a formality.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.319
And the truth is,
the former president

25:28.444 --> 25:30.279
didn't even want you
in his administration.

25:30.947 --> 25:34.367
So if you weren't good enough
to be the HUD Secretary,

25:34.492 --> 25:36.160
please, from your heart,

25:36.285 --> 25:39.121
can you tell me why you think
you should be my president?

25:39.622 --> 25:40.748
I can't.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.001
Excuse me?

25:56.264 --> 25:58.015
You may be right.

25:59.100 --> 26:01.102
Maybe I should not be president.

26:15.116 --> 26:18.160
This is getting out of control. Sir,
you need to get in there and fight back.

26:18.286 --> 26:19.537
Fight back how, Aaron?

26:19.662 --> 26:22.415
You can start by reminding them that
you're the President of the United States.

26:22.540 --> 26:25.418
Governor Nichols is right.
I wasn't Richmond's choice for president.

26:25.543 --> 26:28.254
I wasn't anyone's choice.
Richmond didn't want me in his cabinet,

26:28.379 --> 26:29.922
at the State of the Union.

26:30.047 --> 26:33.342
That's why I was named
Designated Survivor. Tell me I'm wrong.

26:34.176 --> 26:37.054
Look, six weeks ago,
I barely remembered your name.

26:37.555 --> 26:39.181
I didn't know much about you,

26:39.307 --> 26:41.225
and, frankly, what I did know
didn't impress me.

26:41.350 --> 26:43.936
But, sir, I don't feel
the same way anymore.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.063
Iran, Royce, Nassar.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.232
And what you said
at the Capitol site that day,

26:48.357 --> 26:50.901
that we would rise better
and stronger than ever before.

26:51.569 --> 26:53.029
I believed you.

26:54.488 --> 26:57.533
So don't let those people
bring you down.

26:59.869 --> 27:01.078
I truly believe

27:01.203 --> 27:03.497
you're the only chance
this country has.

27:08.002 --> 27:09.086
What he said.

27:10.713 --> 27:11.964
Come in.

27:12.089 --> 27:12.965
Hey.

27:13.090 --> 27:16.135
- Oh, is it a bad time?
- No. Thank you both.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.553
Aaron.

27:19.597 --> 27:20.765
Thank you.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.100
Mr. President.
Ma'am.

27:23.225 --> 27:24.101
What's going on?

27:24.226 --> 27:26.937
I got to get back to the governors.
Emily can't hold them off forever.

27:27.063 --> 27:30.149
One of the Syrian refugees is only
30 weeks pregnant, she's gone into labor.

27:30.274 --> 27:33.235
We need to get Governor Rivera
to let her off that plane now.

27:33.361 --> 27:35.446
Governor Rivera won't
be taking any requests from me.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.114
This is beyond a request.
It's an emergency.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.282
I understand what you're saying, Alex.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.910
I've got no leverage with him.
I need you to handle it, please.

27:41.035 --> 27:41.952
Okay.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.749
You pulled it off,

27:46.874 --> 27:49.460
something that we all thought
was unimaginable.

27:50.044 --> 27:51.128
But you were sloppy.

27:51.253 --> 27:54.131
One of your bombs didn't detonate,
and a congressman survived.

27:54.256 --> 27:56.467
That must bother you,

27:56.592 --> 27:57.968
not finishing the job.

27:58.094 --> 28:02.056
We will take out your congressman
and anyone else we missed.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.309
Because you want MacLeish dead.

28:05.434 --> 28:07.061
I want them all dead!

28:11.649 --> 28:14.110
Whoever blew up the Capitol
wanted MacLeish to live.

28:16.237 --> 28:18.823
But you don't know that
because you didn't do it.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.993
Why are you taking credit
for something you didn't do?

28:25.287 --> 28:27.832
Governor,
she's in preterm labor.

28:27.957 --> 28:30.126
Y-You have to do something.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.670
I'll send in a doctor.

28:32.795 --> 28:36.006
If that baby is born on the plane,
he or she becomes an American citizen,

28:36.132 --> 28:37.883
so why not take her to the hospital,

28:38.008 --> 28:40.344
- where she can deliver it safely?
- Fine. She can go.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.138
And the husband, the baby's father?

28:42.263 --> 28:43.681
Yes. Him, too.

28:43.806 --> 28:44.890
Thank you.

28:45.015 --> 28:46.392
And once they're off the plane,

28:46.517 --> 28:47.810
it can return to Istanbul.

28:47.935 --> 28:49.562
But what about
the rest of the passengers?

28:49.687 --> 28:50.563
No.

28:50.688 --> 28:53.023
As we discussed,
they are all registered with DHS.

28:53.149 --> 28:54.650
And as I told you before, ma'am,

28:54.775 --> 28:56.360
the people of my state are frightened.

28:56.485 --> 28:59.238
And after Brussels, Paris,
Nice, Washington,

28:59.363 --> 29:00.698
they have a right to be suspicious.

29:00.823 --> 29:03.200
But what about
the millions of Syrian refugees

29:03.325 --> 29:05.202
that Europe has taken in?
What have they done?

29:05.327 --> 29:06.579
- It's what they <i>could</i> do.
- Uh--

29:06.704 --> 29:08.998
Ma'am, why don't you quit
while you're ahead?

29:13.294 --> 29:14.670
I'll let the family know.

29:15.337 --> 29:18.174
So you didn't blow up the Capitol,
but you took credit for it

29:18.299 --> 29:21.051
because the actual attackers
wanted to stay anonymous.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.888
And the only way for them
to do that was to contact you,

29:24.013 --> 29:26.599
let you know what type
of munitions they used

29:26.724 --> 29:29.059
so you can convince the public
that it was you.

29:29.185 --> 29:30.227
I'm done here.

29:30.352 --> 29:31.729
That's fine. We're done, too.

29:31.854 --> 29:33.397
Who's gonna call GID?

29:33.522 --> 29:34.398
About Dena?

29:34.523 --> 29:35.357
Yeah.

29:35.483 --> 29:37.777
- I'll do it.
- Okay.

29:42.239 --> 29:45.701
So, you didn't know that we know
about your other family?

29:45.826 --> 29:47.870
The one that wasn't killed.

29:47.995 --> 29:50.414
They have such a nice life in Dubai.

29:50.539 --> 29:52.082
Your boy with his soccer team,

29:52.208 --> 29:54.919
and your mom getting such
great treatment for diabetes.

29:55.044 --> 29:58.088
The thing is,
if we send you to Pakistan,

29:58.214 --> 30:00.508
they'll also be on a plane
in six hours out of DXB.

30:01.217 --> 30:03.302
I guess mom's just gonna
have to take her chances

30:03.427 --> 30:04.929
- with Pakistani hospitals.
- Yeah.

30:05.054 --> 30:06.138
And who knows? In her condition,

30:06.263 --> 30:08.390
it's gonna be a rough flight.

30:12.228 --> 30:13.229
Wait!

30:24.114 --> 30:26.575
He said he wanted the same thing,

30:27.743 --> 30:29.036
death to America.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.248
And you took the credit

30:32.373 --> 30:34.625
so they could stay under the radar.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.126
What's his name?

30:36.252 --> 30:37.169
I don't know.

30:37.294 --> 30:38.671
- What is his name?!
- He didn't say.

30:38.796 --> 30:40.297
You're telling me
you signed on to this,

30:40.422 --> 30:42.299
and you don't know
the person who set you up?

30:42.424 --> 30:43.634
You're gonna lose this family.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.261
You're gonna lose your mom.

30:45.386 --> 30:48.347
All for someone
who's playing you like a damn fool!

30:48.472 --> 30:49.557
Catalan!

30:52.601 --> 30:54.895
He said his name was Catalan.

30:55.437 --> 30:56.939
Catalan.

30:57.940 --> 30:58.816
Oh.

30:58.941 --> 31:00.484
Guard.

31:00.609 --> 31:01.777
If you tell anyone...

31:03.153 --> 31:04.488
he'll kill you, too.

31:08.450 --> 31:09.326
Let him eat.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.665
<i>Earlier, you asked me</i>

31:14.790 --> 31:18.002
why I thought
I should be your president.

31:18.127 --> 31:20.796
That is a question
that I have wrestled with

31:20.921 --> 31:23.716
every single day and night
since I have been sworn in.

31:23.841 --> 31:27.136
And the only answer
I keep coming back to

31:27.261 --> 31:29.013
is what I told you last night.

31:29.138 --> 31:32.224
I think that I can effect change

31:32.349 --> 31:33.809
and promote unity.

31:34.643 --> 31:37.771
Never before in my life
have I felt this more strongly.

31:38.314 --> 31:41.859
The depth of love that I have
for this country and its survival.

31:41.984 --> 31:44.361
But I cannot do this alone.

31:44.486 --> 31:48.449
Nor can I waste any more time
fighting with you.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.160
We need to move forward together,

31:52.453 --> 31:54.496
or I need to step down.

31:56.123 --> 31:57.541
Ladies and gentlemen...

31:59.501 --> 32:01.337
this is your moment to choose,

32:03.005 --> 32:06.216
to decide what side of history
you want to be standing on

32:06.342 --> 32:07.843
when the dust settles.

32:09.845 --> 32:11.055
Thank you.

32:23.025 --> 32:25.027
- It's in their corner now.
- Yeah.

32:27.196 --> 32:29.657
We'll know soon enough.

32:30.908 --> 32:33.243
Those were thoughtful words,
Mr. President.

32:33.369 --> 32:34.411
Thank you.

32:35.037 --> 32:36.747
But if you want us
to get behind you,

32:36.872 --> 32:40.042
don't just tell us
what you're gonna do. Show us.

32:40.542 --> 32:42.628
I would love that opportunity.

32:42.753 --> 32:45.422
Then let's begin
with the situation in Florida.

32:45.547 --> 32:49.301
These refugees are emblematic
of a much larger issue.

32:49.426 --> 32:52.596
The threat to our country
from unchecked immigration.

32:52.721 --> 32:56.433
And so we want you to suspend it
until we feel safe.

32:56.558 --> 32:58.435
Suspend immigration from where?

32:58.560 --> 33:00.270
Everywhere.

33:00.938 --> 33:02.064
Everywhere?

33:03.941 --> 33:06.819
You understand what that means?
We're not just talking about refugees.

33:06.944 --> 33:09.279
We're... We're talking
about Australian students,

33:09.405 --> 33:11.448
German scientists,
engineers from India.

33:11.573 --> 33:14.243
Our security is worth the sacrifice.

33:17.246 --> 33:19.081
And you all feel this way?

33:19.206 --> 33:22.418
Enough of us to stand in the way
of your Congress, Mr. President.

33:23.419 --> 33:25.129
So, which do you want more?

33:25.254 --> 33:27.631
Immigration or a Congress?

33:27.756 --> 33:29.550
The choice is yours.

33:37.891 --> 33:39.476
A nationwide ban on immigration.

33:39.601 --> 33:41.478
I can't believe you really want that.

33:41.603 --> 33:42.813
Please, sit.

33:42.938 --> 33:44.356
Mr. President,
we're not talking permanent.

33:44.481 --> 33:46.442
We're talking until things settle.

33:46.567 --> 33:49.153
Are you really so scared
of these refugees

33:49.278 --> 33:51.989
that you'd be willing
to leave your own constituents

33:52.114 --> 33:53.657
without a voice
in their federal government?

33:53.782 --> 33:55.993
Sir, our people are scared.

33:56.118 --> 33:57.953
It only takes one person
to set us back,

33:58.078 --> 34:01.832
and that plane is simply a microcosm
of a much larger issue.

34:01.957 --> 34:03.959
Our borders are compromised
every day.

34:04.084 --> 34:06.336
Foreigners are streaming in
on all sides,

34:06.462 --> 34:07.671
and we need to stop it.

34:07.796 --> 34:10.674
Our country is not the same anymore.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.469
Not since the terrorists
took down our Capitol.

34:17.431 --> 34:18.474
Just so we're clear.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.145
If I refuse to allow these people
to enter the country,

34:23.270 --> 34:25.147
the rest of the governors
will get behind me?

34:27.858 --> 34:30.194
A majority, Mr. President.

34:30.319 --> 34:31.487
At that point,

34:31.612 --> 34:34.322
no one would want
to be left out in the cold.

34:40.370 --> 34:42.331
It's the one time in life

34:42.456 --> 34:44.373
I did not want you to be right.

34:44.833 --> 34:46.335
Honestly, me neither.

34:46.460 --> 34:47.878
But you heard him, Jason.

34:48.003 --> 34:50.047
Al-Sakar didn't
blow up the Capitol.

34:50.172 --> 34:51.882
And who the hell is Catalan?

34:52.007 --> 34:54.592
We're about to find out.

35:01.350 --> 35:02.434
Nothing.

35:02.559 --> 35:03.727
How can it be nothing?

35:03.852 --> 35:06.396
Let me try a different spelling.

35:13.195 --> 35:14.113
No results.

35:14.238 --> 35:16.490
Nothing for our entire terrorist database?

35:17.533 --> 35:18.742
What are we missing?

35:18.867 --> 35:20.244
Maybe he lied.

35:20.369 --> 35:21.870
Maybe there is no Catalan.

35:25.165 --> 35:26.959
Or maybe Catalan's bigger
than we think.

35:27.084 --> 35:29.878
Maybe he's above even your clearance.

35:30.003 --> 35:31.880
We have 14 hours till we lose him.

35:33.048 --> 35:35.300
Seth told me
what you said to the president.

35:35.425 --> 35:37.678
I think it was really great.

35:39.388 --> 35:41.098
Hello? Aaron?

35:41.223 --> 35:43.559
- Rare compliment here.
- I-I'm sorry.

35:43.684 --> 35:44.810
What are you reading?

35:44.935 --> 35:46.937
Look, I know you asked the FBI

35:47.062 --> 35:48.272
to start vetting MacLeish,

35:48.397 --> 35:50.983
but since the president
let it leak to some of the governors,

35:51.108 --> 35:54.278
I figured I'd get a head start,
so I contacted my researcher.

35:54.403 --> 35:55.904
The one who resurrected
Jeffrey Myers?

35:56.029 --> 35:56.780
Yeah.

35:56.905 --> 35:57.948
How's it looking?

35:58.073 --> 36:00.742
Well, very vice-presidential.

36:07.249 --> 36:08.625
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:08.750 --> 36:10.460
- Thank you, Wyatt.
- Ma'am.

36:10.586 --> 36:14.173
So, I just got off the phone
with Governor Baylin of Missouri.

36:14.298 --> 36:16.758
He says the plane can land
in Jefferson City

36:16.884 --> 36:19.803
and that he will accept
all of the refugees,

36:19.928 --> 36:21.263
even if Florida won't.

36:23.974 --> 36:24.808
What is it?

36:24.933 --> 36:27.644
It's too late. The plane left
10 minutes ago for Toronto.

36:27.769 --> 36:29.188
The mother, the father,
the baby can stay.

36:29.313 --> 36:30.522
Everybody else had to go.

36:30.647 --> 36:31.481
Well, who says?

36:31.607 --> 36:32.774
The governors.

36:33.775 --> 36:34.943
Me.

36:35.777 --> 36:38.697
I had to make a deal to keep
the rest of the governors on board.

36:38.822 --> 36:40.991
Wh-- I thought
we were on the same page.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.993
We were.
We-- We <i>are.</i>

36:43.118 --> 36:44.661
Look, they threatened
to withhold Congress over this.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.038
I had to give them something.

36:46.163 --> 36:49.041
Tom, those people gave up
everything to come here.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.626
This country made them a promise.

36:50.751 --> 36:53.629
Alex, they're going to Canada,
not back to Syria.

36:53.754 --> 36:55.339
They'll still be free.
They'll still be safe.

36:55.464 --> 36:57.633
Yeah, but they could
be free and safe here.

36:57.758 --> 36:59.176
Governor Baylin
is ready for them.

36:59.301 --> 37:01.386
Well, unfortunately,
he's not in the majority.

37:01.511 --> 37:04.014
No, he was standing up
for an American principle.

37:04.139 --> 37:05.849
Who are we
without our principles?

37:05.974 --> 37:07.809
Alex, it was an impossible choice.

37:07.935 --> 37:10.187
I know, and you had to make it
and you will again,

37:10.312 --> 37:12.481
a-and the choices
will always be impossible.

37:12.606 --> 37:13.941
That's not gonna change.

37:14.650 --> 37:17.444
But y-you will, and I will, and...

37:17.986 --> 37:19.279
this will.

37:20.781 --> 37:22.366
It used to be you and me
against the world.

37:22.491 --> 37:25.452
I have an obligation to the country.
I took the job!

37:30.499 --> 37:32.668
I'm not angry with the president.

37:33.835 --> 37:36.296
I am disappointed in my husband.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.676
I need to call Governor Baylin.

38:03.824 --> 38:04.783
Mr. President.

38:04.908 --> 38:06.702
Please tell me you've got
an update on Nassar.

38:06.827 --> 38:09.538
Not yet, sir, but the FBI still has
several hours with him.

38:10.372 --> 38:11.373
Then what is it?

38:11.498 --> 38:12.416
The FBI has indicated

38:12.541 --> 38:14.251
that the MacLeish vetting
might take some time.

38:14.376 --> 38:16.128
So I had someone do
some preliminary digging,

38:16.253 --> 38:17.587
make sure there weren't
any red flags.

38:17.713 --> 38:19.047
And?

38:19.172 --> 38:21.591
Well, actually, sir,
it's looking really good.

38:21.717 --> 38:23.844
I see no reason
why we shouldn't move forward.

38:25.262 --> 38:26.513
Okay. Great.

38:28.223 --> 38:29.933
You know, on second thought,

38:30.058 --> 38:32.602
I'd like to get to know
Congressman MacLeish as a person,

38:32.728 --> 38:35.689
not just a file. What are
the chances of having he and his wife

38:35.814 --> 38:37.774
over to the White House
for dinner later tonight?

38:38.734 --> 38:40.610
Sure.
I'm sure that could be arranged.

38:40.736 --> 38:42.404
What about Mrs. Kirkman?

38:42.529 --> 38:44.114
I'll let her know.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.657
Thank you.
Have a good night.

38:45.782 --> 38:46.908
Sir.

38:47.284 --> 38:49.911
Mr. President, are you okay?

38:51.413 --> 38:52.539
It's fine.

38:53.123 --> 38:54.291
Thank you.

38:55.292 --> 38:56.293
Good night.

39:07.763 --> 39:08.638
Ritter.

39:08.764 --> 39:09.681
<i>Mike.</i>

39:09.806 --> 39:11.350
It's Tom Kirkman.

39:11.475 --> 39:13.643
<i>Yes, Mr. President. I know.</i>

39:13.769 --> 39:14.811
How are you feeling?

39:14.936 --> 39:15.771
<i>Lucky.</i>

39:15.896 --> 39:17.981
The pain meds don't hurt, either.

39:19.149 --> 39:21.109
<i>- How are you?</i>
- To be honest,

39:21.234 --> 39:23.278
I'm just glad
to hear your voice.

39:24.071 --> 39:25.655
I don't know
how to thank you enough.

39:26.615 --> 39:28.617
<i>You went above and beyond.</i>

39:28.742 --> 39:30.410
I just did my job.

39:31.328 --> 39:32.287
And...

39:33.580 --> 39:35.624
it's an honor, sir.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.835
<i>I'm about to watch my Caps
crush your Islanders.</i>

39:40.128 --> 39:41.671
That'll be all the thanks I need.

39:41.797 --> 39:46.009
Well, for one night only, Mike,
I'm gonna be rooting for your Caps, too.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.345
<i>- Good night, sir.</i>
- Get some rest.

39:48.470 --> 39:49.596
<i>Thank you.</i>

39:57.938 --> 40:00.023
Hey, sorry.
Uh, meeting ran over.

40:00.148 --> 40:03.193
Look, basically,
I have no time off ever.

40:03.318 --> 40:06.196
Uh, but there's a bottle
of sparking cider on the second floor

40:06.321 --> 40:07.697
if you still want that drink.

40:07.823 --> 40:09.658
Sounds juvenile. I'm in. But...

40:09.783 --> 40:12.035
...mind if I get a little business
out of the way first?

40:12.160 --> 40:13.537
I need a comment.

40:13.662 --> 40:15.664
Sure. What's up?
Congress, Al-Sakar, refugees?

40:15.789 --> 40:19.334
It's more of a personal nature.

40:19.459 --> 40:20.627
Okay.

40:22.045 --> 40:26.842
I have a source claiming that
Leo Kirkman is not the president's son.

40:45.026 --> 40:46.027
Atwood.

40:48.071 --> 40:48.947
What?

40:49.072 --> 40:50.949
How the hell did that happen?

40:51.074 --> 40:54.244
No, we're right outside.
All right, we'll be right there.

40:54.369 --> 40:55.495
- What is it?
- Nassar.

40:56.705 --> 40:59.249
<i>President Kirkman's promise
to rebuild the government</i>

40:59.374 --> 41:01.418
<i>is closer to reality today.</i>

41:01.543 --> 41:02.919
<i>At the close
of the governors' summit,</i>

41:03.044 --> 41:04.963
<i>the White House confirmed
that all 50</i>

41:05.088 --> 41:07.257
<i>had delivered their appointees
to the new Senate</i>

41:07.382 --> 41:09.759
<i>and agreed to hold
special House elections.</i>

41:09.885 --> 41:11.428
<i>This was the first major step for...</i>

41:11.553 --> 41:13.180
You got your Congress.

41:13.555 --> 41:14.931
Hey.

41:15.891 --> 41:18.435
We've got a ways to go,
but it's a start.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.479
Look, about earlier today, I--

41:20.604 --> 41:22.439
No. I get it.

41:22.939 --> 41:24.900
You're always gonna
disappoint someone.

41:25.025 --> 41:27.652
It's a professional hazard,

41:27.777 --> 41:29.988
especially in your line of work.

41:32.073 --> 41:34.284
I invited the MacLeishes
over for dinner tonight.

41:34.409 --> 41:36.244
I'm vetting him for VP.

41:38.246 --> 41:40.582
I'll just tell them
you're not feeling well.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.083
No.

41:43.877 --> 41:45.170
I'll be there.

41:48.632 --> 41:50.133
Thank you.

41:53.261 --> 41:54.763
Let's go. Don't move.

41:54.888 --> 41:57.474
Clear the area!
Medical personnel only.

41:57.599 --> 41:59.142
Full lock-down.

41:59.267 --> 42:00.769
Full lock-down now!

42:02.479 --> 42:03.647
What happened?!

42:03.772 --> 42:05.190
I went in to get his dinner tray,

42:05.315 --> 42:07.067
and I found him like this.

42:11.655 --> 42:13.490
They tried to revive him,
but it was too late.
