01:26.103 --> 01:29.227
<i>And now it's time for "The Gig of Life."</i>

01:29.307 --> 01:32.003
<i>What's hot, what's not in the world of rock.</i>

01:32.083 --> 01:35.686
<i>Remember Metal Assassin
led by Chilean-born Turk Enry?</i>

01:35.766 --> 01:39.224
<i>At the time of their tender breakout hit
"Teenage Ass Patrol"...</i>

01:45.523 --> 01:48.552
<i>...they seemed unstoppable,
until they stopped.</i>

01:48.632 --> 01:52.249
<i>The band kicked Turk out
when he met his very own Yoko Ono.</i>

01:52.329 --> 01:55.653
<i>Her name was Sheila, and Turk
began a long fade to black...</i>

01:55.733 --> 01:59.053
<i>...whilst his ex-bandmates</i>
<i>released</i> Neptune of Cock.

01:59.603 --> 02:01.459
<i>It sold in the millions.</i>

02:01.539 --> 02:05.596
<i>Turk, by contrast, was enjoying
external tours off his body.</i>

02:05.676 --> 02:09.318
<i>Now a recluse, Turk has reportedly
not left his Malibu mansion...</i>

02:09.399 --> 02:12.804
<i>...in over two years,
which qualifies him for this week's...</i>

02:12.884 --> 02:16.661
- <i>...down and out celebrity in rock.</i>
- Sheila!

02:19.223 --> 02:23.531
Speak English, Pepito. You know
perfectly well I don't speak Spanish.

02:23.611 --> 02:27.053
- I'm English from London, remember?
- Okay, can I help, sir?

02:27.133 --> 02:30.024
Yes. Yes, you could help me.
I need to throw this TV...

02:30.104 --> 02:32.023
- ...into the pool!
- <i>¿Que?</i>

02:32.103 --> 02:35.029
This TV set into the swimming pool!

02:35.109 --> 02:38.319
- Yeah, okay. Okay.
- Okay? Okay?

02:45.648 --> 02:47.305
Sheila!

02:47.785 --> 02:49.974
Would you like to check the guarantee first?

02:50.054 --> 02:51.331
Sheila!

03:00.433 --> 03:01.535
Sheila!

03:01.615 --> 03:04.711
I'm up here packing for our trip to Chile!

03:13.274 --> 03:16.295
- Sheila.
- Yes, Turk?

03:18.080 --> 03:20.704
I have decided
I don't want to go on vacation.

03:20.784 --> 03:23.588
Vacations are too stressful.

03:23.668 --> 03:26.830
But we're going there so that I can
learn more about your culture.

03:26.910 --> 03:30.754
But Chile's not my home.
I can't even speak Spanish.

03:30.834 --> 03:34.117
You mean you won't even speak Spanish.
Come on. They love you back there.

03:34.197 --> 03:38.088
- Your picture's on every wall.
- Well, but I was young then, you know?

03:38.168 --> 03:42.926
Sorry... younger than now,
where I'm also young.

03:43.206 --> 03:45.596
And we need some time alone.

03:45.676 --> 03:49.533
You know, no assistants,
no bodyguards, no drivers.

03:49.613 --> 03:52.519
No nobody. Just us.

03:52.849 --> 03:55.859
Maybe you'll get inspired.
Maybe you'll start writing again.

03:55.939 --> 03:59.363
Oh, no, my chair is here.
I want to sit in my chair.

03:59.443 --> 04:02.402
- I love my chair!
- Fine!

04:02.482 --> 04:06.973
You can stay if you get rid of that hunk of
junk that's been rotting in our front yard.

04:07.665 --> 04:10.587
That van is a reminder
of how far I have come.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.190
You know, it keeps me down to Earth.
Be careful there!

04:13.270 --> 04:14.908
Yeah, of course. It keeps you down to Earth.

04:14.988 --> 04:18.678
You just got a delivery of a crate of beer
that says it was brewed in space.

04:19.348 --> 04:21.680
So we keep the van, right?

04:21.761 --> 04:24.264
- Fine! Chile it is.
- Yeah.

04:24.344 --> 04:27.921
Besides, I have already
been back to Chile, you know?

04:28.001 --> 04:31.080
That was on tour! That doesn't count!

04:33.739 --> 04:36.296
- What?
- When I was on tour there...

04:36.376 --> 04:40.100
...I got so drunk in a bar in Valparaiso...

04:40.180 --> 04:43.736
...that I had a piss
that lasted seven minutes.

04:43.816 --> 04:46.073
You know, the owner was so impressed...

04:46.173 --> 04:49.009
...he told me he would build
a statue to commemorate it.

04:49.089 --> 04:52.079
That's great. So we'll go
and visit the shrine to your piss.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.880
- Yeah?
- Go and pack.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.342
- I have already packed.
- Then go and watch TV.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.064
We're in Chile!

05:23.155 --> 05:25.435
Oh, baby, baby. Look, look!

05:30.203 --> 05:33.193
Look, the trains in Chile are blue! See?

05:46.345 --> 05:48.224
Baby! Baby!

05:50.950 --> 05:53.563
- <i>Gracias!</i>
- <i>Gracias!</i>

06:12.776 --> 06:15.285
Where is your assistance? Turk!

06:20.913 --> 06:23.793
Why is this place so empty?

06:40.834 --> 06:43.390
Hey, hey, lady.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.459
Why it's so cold here?

06:45.539 --> 06:47.796
It's winter, sir.

06:48.376 --> 06:52.090
I'm not good with months,
but it's July, right?

06:55.749 --> 06:59.173
I don't speak Spanish. I am English...

06:59.253 --> 07:02.149
...so I do speak beer,
and, yes, I would love one.

07:02.229 --> 07:04.111
- Beer.
- Yes, indeed.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.237
Beer is always in season.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.272
Turk!

07:10.197 --> 07:13.280
I'm here! Oh, shit.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.157
- Baby.
- Hey, hey, hey.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.193
You knew it was winter.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.319
Yeah, it's July. In Chile, July is winter.

07:23.109 --> 07:26.126
- July is summer.
- Who's your new friend?

07:26.206 --> 07:28.935
He's my new manager, you know.

07:29.015 --> 07:33.160
I'm gonna fire John. This little dude over
here can get me everything I need now.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.808
Beer.

07:35.188 --> 07:37.578
- He just gets me. All right.
- Yeah, okay.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.470
We have to get going.
We leave in six minutes.

07:40.562 --> 07:44.685
Do you wanna come on a beautiful,
breathtaking, once-in-a-lifetime hike...

07:44.765 --> 07:46.720
...through the mountains
with your loving wife...

07:46.850 --> 07:49.720
...or do you wanna lie here alone
in the cold and drink beer?

07:49.800 --> 07:51.031
Beer.

07:52.621 --> 07:54.942
He makes a compelling argument.

07:55.022 --> 07:59.383
- Where is your sense of adventure?
- Well, I have done three world tours.

07:59.463 --> 08:01.909
I'm told they were very...

08:06.335 --> 08:08.959
- ...eventful.
- Please, Turk.

08:09.039 --> 08:13.284
You need to do something.
The band's over, not your life.

08:13.364 --> 08:17.321
Well, yeah, you better get going.
Your trip leaves in, like, three minutes.

08:17.401 --> 08:20.905
Yeah, sure. I get it. I get that
you don't like anything anymore.

08:20.985 --> 08:23.339
- Oh, no.
- But do you at least like me?

08:23.419 --> 08:26.909
Be honest. Am I Yoko Ono?

08:26.989 --> 08:28.615
Of course not.

08:29.925 --> 08:31.449
Babe.

08:32.229 --> 08:34.551
I'll see you when you get back.

08:35.265 --> 08:38.726
I love you. Have fun.

08:43.573 --> 08:45.385
Well, have fun.

08:48.965 --> 08:53.451
Beer time. Give it to me. Yeah! Oh, yeah.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.464
Mr. Enry won't be joining us.

08:58.754 --> 09:01.168
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thanks.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.615
No, no. This is my better side.

09:04.895 --> 09:06.583
- Hello.
- Hello.

09:06.663 --> 09:08.252
You know you shouldn't tip them.

09:08.332 --> 09:12.289
Yeah, you can't let them think that they
can earn money just by being nice.

09:12.619 --> 09:14.852
Are you excited about the llamas?

09:15.006 --> 09:17.227
Me and Charlie cannot wait to see the llamas.

09:17.307 --> 09:21.131
- I can give or take the llamas.
- Charlie, you bloody fibber.

09:21.211 --> 09:24.091
He wouldn't stop talking
about them back at the hotel.

09:25.114 --> 09:28.729
Amy, let's start a Facebook live feed.

09:50.239 --> 09:51.920
Here we are.

09:55.010 --> 09:58.535
<i>Señores, señoras. Bienvenidos.</i> Welcome.

09:58.615 --> 10:03.006
As we make our way up the trail, please
be careful not to startle the llamas, okay?

10:03.086 --> 10:06.306
- They don't take it very well.
- Can you say something really ethnic?

10:06.386 --> 10:08.112
I don't think we say
the word "ethnic" anymore.

10:08.192 --> 10:11.295
Guys! Guys! The llamas,
they're here, okay? Just come, be quiet.

10:11.375 --> 10:14.995
Charlie, don't get too excited. Remember
what happened with that kangaroo.

10:28.745 --> 10:30.834
So beautiful!

10:32.708 --> 10:34.105
Damn right.

10:34.185 --> 10:37.681
God, it's fur is gonna look gorgeous
as a rug in my den.

10:37.761 --> 10:40.411
What? What are you doing?

10:40.991 --> 10:46.417
- I thought this was a sightseeing tour?
- You pay, you see, you shoot, you whatever.

10:47.597 --> 10:50.855
Why would you want to shoot these
creatures? What is wrong with you?

10:50.935 --> 10:53.157
We came all the way down here
to the inferior hemisphere.

10:53.237 --> 10:55.950
We're definitely gonna shoot something.

10:56.030 --> 10:59.229
- I'm not gonna let you do this.
- I don't think you can stop us, honey.

10:59.309 --> 11:00.887
Yeah.

11:03.781 --> 11:07.858
Get out of here! These are bad people!
Bad, bad people!

11:11.653 --> 11:13.881
All right, darlin', we warned ya.

11:13.961 --> 11:16.203
Now get out of the way before we fire.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.264
Well, looky here. A perfect bathmat.

11:48.959 --> 11:51.915
- Oh, my God!
- What are they saying?

11:51.995 --> 11:54.096
They say, "we want the white people."

11:55.831 --> 11:57.157
Okay.

11:57.968 --> 12:02.349
- Wait! Are you just gonna leave us?
- Yes! Goodbye!

12:03.038 --> 12:06.253
Do you have any idea who I am?

12:07.309 --> 12:09.222
Any idea at all?

12:10.312 --> 12:14.904
I am only the CEO of Dynet Media!

12:14.984 --> 12:18.831
World leader in viral marketing.
Ring any bells?

12:20.857 --> 12:22.980
You don't even know
what viral marketing is, do you?

12:23.060 --> 12:24.681
Be quiet and get up!

12:24.761 --> 12:27.268
- I will not get up.
- I shall not get up, either.

12:27.349 --> 12:31.455
There's a reason they keep you people
down here in the bottom of the planet.

12:31.535 --> 12:36.894
Now, I have come to this toilet
of a country to shoot a llama...

12:36.974 --> 12:41.588
...and by God, I am going to shoot a llama!

12:48.986 --> 12:51.874
Never mess with a llama.

12:51.954 --> 12:54.945
Don't mistake their benevolence for weakness.

12:55.025 --> 12:57.303
They are a proud beast.

13:00.063 --> 13:01.284
- <i>Vamos. Vamos.</i>
- No!

13:01.364 --> 13:03.126
Hey! Come.

13:03.206 --> 13:06.245
Well, that wasn't very long
for the llamas, was it?

13:12.411 --> 13:13.981
Look at that.

13:30.292 --> 13:33.884
That's what I have to deal with
on a day-to-day basis.

13:33.964 --> 13:35.976
Do you see what she's doing?

13:44.073 --> 13:47.130
- Sandrine, are you still there?
- Yes, love.

13:47.210 --> 13:50.901
- Do you know where we are?
- No, love. I've got a bag on my head.

13:50.981 --> 13:52.835
Me too.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.894
You wouldn't know it, but I...

13:55.974 --> 13:58.281
...I used to be famous.

13:58.521 --> 14:01.285
I was in a rock band.

14:02.892 --> 14:06.349
Hey, yeah! You're a natural, man.

14:08.298 --> 14:12.022
Yeah. And the one thing that people
don't say to people...

14:12.102 --> 14:15.983
...in rock bands is no.

14:17.239 --> 14:20.664
Well, a long story short...

14:20.744 --> 14:24.557
...I was diagnosed with a sex addiction.

14:24.947 --> 14:27.161
I went to rehab.

14:29.286 --> 14:31.775
<i>I was ready to leave, and...</i>

14:31.855 --> 14:34.912
<i>...but then I met Sheila, you know.</i>

14:35.692 --> 14:38.505
The woman that is always mad with me.

14:39.495 --> 14:41.371
I'll tell you...

14:42.314 --> 14:44.207
...she saved me.

14:44.687 --> 14:47.380
She pulled me back from the brink...

14:48.537 --> 14:50.961
...and my old life.

14:51.041 --> 14:55.722
All that old stuff that I used to do, and...

14:58.447 --> 15:01.671
- Beer.
- Why not? Yeah!

15:01.751 --> 15:03.973
While the cat is away.

15:04.053 --> 15:06.332
Give it to me. Yeah.

15:34.883 --> 15:36.963
Get her passport.

15:39.488 --> 15:41.861
You seem very nervous...

15:41.941 --> 15:43.613
- ...Sandrine.
- It's just...

15:43.693 --> 15:46.683
...it's our first time being kidnapped.
We don't want to get it wrong.

15:46.763 --> 15:49.291
- Do we, Charlie?
- No.

15:49.371 --> 15:50.920
You're doing just fine.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.124
I run a top quality double
glazing company back in London...

15:54.204 --> 15:57.868
...and if we could pay the ransom
in windows, French windows...

15:57.948 --> 16:01.020
- ...we do French windows, too.
- Charlie.

16:09.920 --> 16:12.206
You like the British band Metal Assassin?

16:19.094 --> 16:21.374
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:27.102 --> 16:29.343
Turk Enry is a God.

16:39.949 --> 16:41.494
You...

16:43.952 --> 16:46.143
...are Turk Enry's wife.

16:46.223 --> 16:48.482
Oh, shit.

17:05.907 --> 17:07.520
Yeah!

17:08.612 --> 17:11.023
Sheila, Sheila.

17:12.547 --> 17:14.394
Things are looking up.

17:41.476 --> 17:43.914
When I was five years old, I had a pet cat.

17:45.214 --> 17:47.103
It was a Siamese cat.

17:47.183 --> 17:49.206
I loved him very much.

17:49.786 --> 17:51.907
His name was Nomo.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.000
Like the baseball player?

17:54.923 --> 17:57.948
Exactly like the baseball player...

17:58.628 --> 18:00.147
...except...

18:00.744 --> 18:04.790
...my Nomo was run over by a car...

18:04.870 --> 18:08.225
...dead. I took the body,
sealed it in a plastic bag...

18:08.305 --> 18:12.195
...put it in the family trashcan,
and five long, hot summer days later...

18:12.275 --> 18:16.920
...the stench coming out
of that can was unbelievable.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.142
That's what your town smells like to me.

18:21.400 --> 18:25.148
- Do you know why I like snakes, Ramon?
- No. I don't think anyone does.

18:25.228 --> 18:27.337
Because they're so clean.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.261
And they can shed their skin.
I wish I could shed my skin.

18:31.341 --> 18:34.518
I would just take it all right off right here.
Snakes and I have that in common.

18:34.598 --> 18:37.220
- You know what else we have in common?
- You can dislocate your jaw?

18:37.300 --> 18:40.991
We can only thrive in certain environments.
We need to be in a safe place...

18:41.071 --> 18:44.827
...in order to be the dominant killing
machines that we're meant to be.

18:44.907 --> 18:49.199
What I'm trying to say is I need to
get out of this pestilent colonial dump.

18:49.279 --> 18:51.357
I'm wasted.

18:56.852 --> 19:00.076
- Here it is.
- What is it?

19:00.156 --> 19:03.479
A taser gun. They wouldn't authorize
issue, so I just bought one myself.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.049
- A toy one?
- No, it's a real one.

19:06.129 --> 19:10.921
Look, "shock your friends with 20,000 volts.
Be your own real-life dirty Barry."

19:11.001 --> 19:13.122
I'm sure that's just a misprint.

19:13.202 --> 19:16.359
Very impressive, sir.
Chile is a safer place today.

19:16.439 --> 19:19.051
Open this. It's hurting my gums.

19:48.939 --> 19:51.795
This is the hotel manager. It's an emergency!

19:52.575 --> 19:54.153
What?

19:55.412 --> 19:58.091
Excuse me. May I come in?

19:59.682 --> 20:02.137
All right. Come in.

20:02.217 --> 20:06.476
I'm sorry, sir. I've been ringing you
over and over again without an answer.

20:06.556 --> 20:08.744
You better be telling me
that it's the end of the world...

20:08.824 --> 20:11.448
...or that someone kidnapped my wife.

20:11.528 --> 20:15.451
- Someone has kidnapped your wife.
- Exactly. You better be telling me that.

20:15.531 --> 20:18.077
Someone has kidnapped your wife.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.525
They're asking for a million dollars.

20:24.505 --> 20:28.387
Oh, thank God. I thought
they'd be asking for a lot of money.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.474
John Hardigger's office, this is Marybeth.

20:38.554 --> 20:41.678
Hey, Marybeth. It's Turk.
I need to speak to John.

20:41.758 --> 20:45.348
Turk! Well, John's in a meeting.

20:45.428 --> 20:47.824
Who is he with that is
more important than me?

20:47.904 --> 20:50.153
Right now, Turk, everyone.

20:50.633 --> 20:54.424
Well, he's in a meeting with the lead
singer of Masculine Harmony right now...

20:54.504 --> 20:56.893
...trying to convince him
to stay in the closet.

20:56.973 --> 20:59.736
We all want to be gay, Steve. All of us.

20:59.976 --> 21:03.766
No women telling us what to do,
great fashion sense.

21:03.846 --> 21:08.441
You can seemingly grab women's breasts
willy-nilly, and it's apparently fine.

21:08.521 --> 21:13.509
But I just don't see that working for you
in the context of the music industry.

21:13.589 --> 21:16.079
Look, think about it.
Which would you rather have...

21:16.159 --> 21:20.974
...the freedom to love whoever
you choose or loads of cash?

21:21.054 --> 21:23.090
- Can I help you?
- <i>Tell John...</i>

21:23.170 --> 21:26.089
...that Sheila has been kidnapped
and they need a million dollars!

21:26.169 --> 21:29.859
Well, I don't need John. I wouldn't even
wake him up for a million dollars.

21:29.939 --> 21:35.331
That's what I said! Listen, this has
to stay between the three of us, okay?

21:35.411 --> 21:38.835
Or they say they'll kill her.
I need the money, like, right now!

21:38.915 --> 21:41.980
- Is that understood? Can you handle it?
- I'm on it. I'm on it.

21:42.060 --> 21:46.042
And tell John to fuck off for never
answering my calls anymore.

21:46.122 --> 21:49.479
<i>Okay, tell John you need a million
dollars for his kidnapped wife...</i>

21:49.559 --> 21:52.365
...keep it a secret, and to fuck off. Got it.

21:52.445 --> 21:56.176
Bye. Bye. Yeah, yeah. That's it.

21:58.735 --> 22:02.625
- Have you heard of the <i>gatos</i> ?
- Doesn't that mean cats?

22:02.705 --> 22:06.823
It does. In Chile,
that's what we call our pirates.

22:07.643 --> 22:11.600
They are former fisherman who were
crowded out by big companies.

22:11.680 --> 22:14.834
You see, in this country,
a few wealthy people like you...

22:14.914 --> 22:17.588
...they own and control everything...

22:18.241 --> 22:20.910
...even the licenses of who can fish.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.314
That is why this village that we're in now...

22:24.394 --> 22:29.363
...once thriving with the life and
laughter of families, now lies empty.

22:29.443 --> 22:33.720
Now the gatos rob the big boats
to get their fish back.

22:34.270 --> 22:37.226
What I do have is my crew...

22:37.306 --> 22:39.563
...and what I do not have is a ship.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.904
So you see, that's why
you're here, unfortunately.

22:43.379 --> 22:48.120
I, too, like the <i>gatos</i>, had to make
the choice between starving...

22:48.200 --> 22:50.607
...and this dangerous life you see.

22:51.587 --> 22:55.268
Listen, when I was modeling,
I had to skip meals all the time, too.

23:02.997 --> 23:05.255
Okay, here's the deal.

23:05.345 --> 23:07.953
Some foreigners have been kidnapped
in Cerro la Cam...

23:08.033 --> 23:09.639
Campana.

23:09.719 --> 23:12.195
But one of them is a celebrity.

23:12.775 --> 23:14.822
What? What? What? A movie star? Who is it?

23:14.902 --> 23:17.198
Okay, listen.
We've gotta keep this on the QT.

23:17.278 --> 23:20.003
Not even the legal attaché finds out
about it until I've checked it out.

23:20.083 --> 23:22.506
Everything is on QT. Got it.

23:24.286 --> 23:27.610
- Where is QT?
- You don't know what QT means?

23:27.690 --> 23:30.527
I learn English at night school, sir.
I almost did ceramics.

23:30.618 --> 23:34.284
- It means quiet.
- Ceramics means pots.

23:34.364 --> 23:36.166
No, QT means quiet.

23:36.246 --> 23:38.905
I see. It's almost onomatopoeic?

23:40.035 --> 23:42.360
You know onomatopoeic, but you don't know QT?

23:42.440 --> 23:44.473
- I did not set the curriculum.
- Okay, listen...

23:44.553 --> 23:47.624
...this could be a straightforward
case of kidnapping, or...

23:47.704 --> 23:51.134
...it could be something a little
more sinister, like terrorist activity.

23:52.214 --> 23:54.870
Terrorists? Here?

23:54.950 --> 23:59.514
It would be to my advantage if it were.
It would help me get a position in Washington.

24:01.856 --> 24:05.427
Do you have a shower here?
I'd love to clean up.

24:19.274 --> 24:21.207
I will be just outside the door.

24:38.683 --> 24:40.906
How you getting on in there?

24:43.197 --> 24:45.527
I'm fine, thanks!

25:07.256 --> 25:09.542
Finished showering, I see.

25:13.695 --> 25:16.575
How long exactly have you guys been pirates?

25:17.833 --> 25:20.880
Almost nine hours.

25:32.707 --> 25:36.039
Are you the concierge?
That's the lighter that doesn't work.

25:36.119 --> 25:39.741
No, Mr. Turk, I am Federal Agent Harding.

25:40.121 --> 25:43.062
- Enry.
- No, Harding. Ben Harding.

25:43.142 --> 25:45.087
- I am Enry.
- I thought it was Turk.

25:45.167 --> 25:48.751
Turk Enry. Please, take a seat.

25:48.831 --> 25:52.088
Listen, Mr. Enry,
American three-letter agencies...

25:52.168 --> 25:54.947
...are already at work on your case.
You should expect...

25:55.027 --> 25:57.436
Well, you know, my manager
is taking care of everything.

25:57.516 --> 26:00.763
It won't take long, and I'm sorry
we have wasted your time.

26:00.843 --> 26:02.932
Mr. Enry, there are some things
we need to discuss.

26:03.012 --> 26:06.102
I'm concerned they're asking
for so much money.

26:07.882 --> 26:11.773
One million. Do you think
that's a lot of money?

26:11.853 --> 26:16.012
Well, you know, I once bought
a giant "tor-toys" for 2 million.

26:16.092 --> 26:19.949
I thought I could ride up the street,
you know, like the king of tortoises...

26:20.029 --> 26:22.986
...but that thing barely bloody moved.

26:23.066 --> 26:25.529
You could use the back of it as a table.

26:25.609 --> 26:30.282
We believe this is the work
of a terrorist cell.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.530
- Terrorists?
- We heard some chatter...

26:35.210 --> 26:38.134
...from the Aggregate Homeland/NSA...

26:38.214 --> 26:41.760
...metadata harvesting machines
up in outer space.

26:43.418 --> 26:45.741
Now, it's classified for your safety.

26:45.821 --> 26:48.578
Screw it. You know, it makes no difference.

26:48.658 --> 26:51.147
I'll pay the money, I get Sheila back...

26:51.227 --> 26:55.785
...and maybe next time she'll think twice
before flying us to exotic places.

26:55.865 --> 26:58.288
Maybe you don't understand me.

26:58.368 --> 27:01.758
The United States government
does not negotiate with terrorists...

27:01.838 --> 27:04.414
...and we cannot allow you to fund them.

27:04.494 --> 27:08.064
I'm not starting an Indiegogo for Isis.
I'm getting my wife back.

27:08.144 --> 27:11.000
Imagine what those savages
could do with a million dollars.

27:11.080 --> 27:14.170
Yeah, they could buy half a giant tortoise.

27:14.650 --> 27:17.573
- What's a "tor-toys"?
- It's a big animal with a shell.

27:17.653 --> 27:19.531
So it's a turtle.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.656
Luis was a bus boy.

27:34.536 --> 27:36.715
Diego was a school teacher.

27:37.705 --> 27:39.992
We all wanted something more.

27:40.072 --> 27:42.365
When you're poor, people take from you...

27:42.845 --> 27:45.301
...until you can't take it anymore...

27:46.081 --> 27:47.906
...and then you take back.

27:48.718 --> 27:51.464
That is freedom.

27:57.425 --> 27:58.848
What's the matter?

27:59.728 --> 28:01.918
Diego is saying he's
putting on too much weight...

28:02.098 --> 28:04.474
...and can we please
cut the carbs in the meal.

28:04.834 --> 28:08.005
He is one fat fucker! Get out!

28:16.846 --> 28:19.589
- Come on.
- <i>Turk!</i>

28:19.669 --> 28:23.105
John says, and I quote,
"you can tell that U.S. government tool...

28:23.185 --> 28:25.575
...that if they think they can keep
you from getting your wife back...

28:25.655 --> 28:29.926
...they're gonna have every media outlet in
the bloody universe climbing up their asses."

28:30.006 --> 28:32.715
<i>Last thing we need to do
is keep this on the QT.</i>

28:32.795 --> 28:35.201
Did... did John really say that?

28:35.281 --> 28:37.820
He would have if he'd read my emails.

28:37.900 --> 28:41.991
<i>Normal people do this every day.
It's as simple as opening a beer.</i>

28:42.071 --> 28:44.827
- Well, who is bringing the money?
- <i>The money's at the bank.</i>

28:44.907 --> 28:48.064
- <i>You just need to go and pick it up.</i>
- Me?

28:48.144 --> 28:52.708
Why do I have to do it? Can I...
can I pay someone to do it?

28:52.788 --> 28:56.795
I don't, you know, do things.

28:58.520 --> 29:01.410
You'll be fine. It's a trip to the bank.

29:01.490 --> 29:04.103
Here, this is how you throw a punch.

29:05.727 --> 29:08.651
- John should be here.
- Pick up the money, wait for the kidnappers.

29:08.731 --> 29:12.488
- Nothing to worry about.
- I am bloody terrified.

29:12.568 --> 29:15.624
It will all be over soon. I promise.

29:15.704 --> 29:19.351
<i>And I'll keep trying to reach John,
but you don't need him.</i>

29:19.809 --> 29:21.320
Shit!

29:22.911 --> 29:24.733
What did she call me?

29:24.813 --> 29:26.325
Tool.

29:31.786 --> 29:33.675
Here's your taxi, sir.

29:34.055 --> 29:36.068
Wait, wait, wait.

30:10.558 --> 30:13.605
Pedicab. All right.

30:17.031 --> 30:20.122
Welcome to Banco Nacional, Mr. Enry.
Everything is ready for you.

30:20.202 --> 30:23.081
Very good. Very good. Excellent.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.825
Please.

30:35.148 --> 30:36.962
That's it?

30:37.854 --> 30:41.811
It seems that a million dollars
cash should look more...

30:41.891 --> 30:43.445
...dramatic.

30:43.725 --> 30:49.174
Well, hey, everything else in the world
is just disappointing, so why not this?

30:49.699 --> 30:51.920
Mr. Enry, you must count it.

30:52.000 --> 30:57.256
The main reason I became a musician
was because we only count to four.

30:58.407 --> 30:59.919
Okay.

31:01.010 --> 31:03.766
One, two, three, four.

31:03.846 --> 31:06.268
One, two, three, four.

31:06.348 --> 31:09.104
And one, two, and...

31:09.184 --> 31:10.762
...perfect.

31:15.055 --> 31:18.113
Mr. Enry, I'm sorry.
I can't let you take that money.

31:18.193 --> 31:22.918
What money? I am just a man
going out for a walk with...

31:22.998 --> 31:25.321
- ...his suitcase.
- This is a matter of national security.

31:25.401 --> 31:27.490
No, no, no, no, no.

31:27.570 --> 31:30.326
Mr. Enry, I could have you arrested
for violating the patriot act.

31:30.406 --> 31:34.663
The press'll get wind of this, your wife will
be in even more trouble. Now just stop it.

31:34.743 --> 31:37.400
Just relax. Take a quaalude.

31:37.480 --> 31:40.936
You don't have to save the day.
Somebody else will do it for you.

31:42.016 --> 31:46.703
- Well, yeah. Maybe you're right. Yeah.
- Yes. That's the spirit.

32:05.240 --> 32:08.280
I'm comin' for you, Turk Enry!

32:08.360 --> 32:10.172
Oh, no!

32:12.614 --> 32:14.493
Move it!

32:26.614 --> 32:28.340
Out!

32:37.805 --> 32:41.430
What the fuck am I doing? Out! Get out!

32:47.548 --> 32:49.027
No!

32:51.053 --> 32:53.461
Out! Out of the way!

33:00.194 --> 33:01.917
Oh, my God.

33:02.027 --> 33:04.653
He actually did it.

33:04.733 --> 33:07.613
This is so cool!

33:11.139 --> 33:13.696
Please, please, don't arrest me.

33:13.776 --> 33:17.290
Don't arrest me in front of... of me.

33:20.114 --> 33:23.273
Okay. I'm going to impound the money,
you're gonna stay in your hotel...

33:23.353 --> 33:26.035
...and consider yourself lucky
I don't arrest you.

33:26.115 --> 33:30.646
Am I supposed to say thank you?
Okay, then, thank you, you colossal prick!

33:30.726 --> 33:33.445
You know I need that money to rescue my wife!

33:33.525 --> 33:35.985
I can have you arrested
for violating the espionage act...

33:36.065 --> 33:39.622
...for aiding, abetting,
and communicating with the enemy.

33:39.702 --> 33:44.313
Now, even your high-priced attorney
can't help you when I ship you off to Gitmo.

33:50.578 --> 33:52.458
Good day, sir.

34:09.197 --> 34:12.065
It feels good to speak Spanish.

34:12.905 --> 34:17.226
50 minutes cardio, 50 minutes pilates,
starting at 6:00 every morning.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.911
I can give you a detailed plan.

34:23.712 --> 34:26.167
Plus you need to show strength.

34:26.246 --> 34:28.049
You're a pirate captain.

34:28.129 --> 34:30.472
Yeah. Yeah, tell me...

34:30.552 --> 34:33.031
...tell me more about that.

34:36.489 --> 34:39.972
Excuse me... I'll speak to my crew.

35:05.653 --> 35:07.198
Hi.

35:12.493 --> 35:14.540
A show of strength it is.

35:30.478 --> 35:32.324
What do I do now?

35:33.998 --> 35:38.247
They won't let me pay the ransom.
I can't rescue Sheila.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.383
A beer?

35:42.907 --> 35:44.696
You are so right.

35:45.876 --> 35:49.301
I'll call my manager.
I'm a freakin' rock star.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.403
And I don't have to get my hands dirty.

35:51.483 --> 35:55.074
I pay 10% on everything I earn...

35:55.154 --> 35:59.601
...so someone else can get my wife
out of hostage situations.

36:00.359 --> 36:03.682
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
I can't call John up...

36:03.762 --> 36:07.453
...and Harding has definitely
tapped my phone.

36:07.533 --> 36:10.345
That's how he knew I was at the bank.

36:12.637 --> 36:14.917
You are so sharp, boy.

36:22.546 --> 36:24.303
John Hardigger's office.

36:24.383 --> 36:27.539
Really? I can't even get John at 3 a.m.?

36:27.919 --> 36:32.945
All right, Marybeth...
listen carefully, all right?

36:33.025 --> 36:34.913
My phone is tapped.

36:34.993 --> 36:37.803
Why? You're the most irrelevant
person I know right now.

36:37.883 --> 36:40.032
Just write it down.

36:40.112 --> 36:42.119
<i>I'm speaking in code.</i>

36:42.834 --> 36:45.290
Slots and roulette.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.866
Slots and roulette.

36:47.946 --> 36:51.697
- Good at making friends.
- Good at making friends.

36:51.777 --> 36:54.934
- John Mayer's sixth album...
- Paradise Valley.

36:55.014 --> 36:57.769
- But in Spanish.
- But in Spanish.

36:57.849 --> 37:00.295
My grandmother's homeland.

37:00.919 --> 37:04.966
- Will you remember what I said tonight?
- What I said tonight.

37:05.256 --> 37:07.378
Yeah. Bye.

37:07.458 --> 37:09.038
Casino.

37:11.595 --> 37:12.821
Social.

37:14.532 --> 37:16.798
Valle Paraiso.

37:18.135 --> 37:20.592
Chile. Bob Dylan.

37:20.672 --> 37:23.919
The first line of "Tomorrow Night."

37:25.810 --> 37:30.235
Casino social, Valparaiso, Chile...

37:30.315 --> 37:31.827
...tomorrow.

37:33.151 --> 37:34.673
Shit.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.426
I'm going to south America.

38:09.988 --> 38:13.612
Where are we going?
We've been walking for bloody hours.

38:13.692 --> 38:17.773
And we're both wearing crocs.
They are not a hiking shoe.

38:22.633 --> 38:27.016
Look, if you're gonna kill us, just do it,
all right? Just do it. Just bloody do it!

38:29.340 --> 38:31.520
You don't have to be so enthusiastic, Sandy.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.867
I mean, you don't have to do it.
You really don't.

38:34.947 --> 38:37.836
- <i>Buenos noches.</i>
- That means good night.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.790
- This is it, then.
- Oh, God!

38:39.870 --> 38:42.164
I want you to know
I've always been faithful to you.

38:42.244 --> 38:44.176
- I know, love.
- Do you want to say it back to me?

38:44.256 --> 38:46.661
- What, love?
- That you've been faithful.

38:46.741 --> 38:48.714
- In body or in mind, Charlie?
- What?

38:48.794 --> 38:52.084
- They're two different things.
- Well, just the body thing.

38:52.164 --> 38:54.209
Bloody hell, Charlie!

38:57.768 --> 38:59.314
Captain?

39:03.524 --> 39:05.377
Where have they bloody gone?

39:10.087 --> 39:13.705
God. This is the worst holiday we've been on.

39:13.785 --> 39:16.775
- What, worse than Scotland?
- No, not worse than Scotland.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.361
That bloody awful breakfast bar.

39:24.861 --> 39:29.388
Where were you? You just leave me
all tied up here with <i>Señor</i> Carbs?

39:29.468 --> 39:31.556
All right, Sheila, Sheila,
I understand you're upset...

39:31.636 --> 39:34.052
...and this is not very comfortable
for you, but...

39:34.132 --> 39:37.242
...soon you can go back to being
the pampered wife of a retired rock star.

39:37.322 --> 39:42.458
Excuse me? He is the pampered
husband of a retired supermodel.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.385
Maybe you're right.

40:00.465 --> 40:02.745
I'm just a rock star's wife now.

40:12.510 --> 40:14.600
He's agreed to pay the ransom.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.702
Of course he's going to pay the ransom.

40:17.782 --> 40:19.661
We're married.

40:20.318 --> 40:22.173
And we only have each other now.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.743
Well, what about Metal Assassin?

40:24.823 --> 40:26.645
They split up.

40:27.025 --> 40:30.638
Actually, they split up
with Turk since we got clean.

40:52.516 --> 40:56.798
Yeah, it turns out without the drugs
and sex, they had nothing to talk about.

40:59.090 --> 41:02.180
I don't know if Turk
has ever forgiven me for that.

41:02.260 --> 41:05.907
Well, he hasn't forgiven you
for saving his life?

41:07.197 --> 41:10.623
I'm not sure he thinks
his life's worth too much.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.926
He's been sulking for months.

41:15.106 --> 41:19.187
He wouldn't even go on this tour
of Cayo Santiago with me.

41:20.912 --> 41:25.727
He shouldn't be paying my ransom.
He should be here with me, goddamn it.

41:27.117 --> 41:29.932
My life is just so unfair.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.518
My parents were burned
by narcos when I was three.

41:40.598 --> 41:44.923
As a child alone in the streets amidst
the abuse, the drugs and beatings...

41:45.003 --> 41:48.427
...I had one friend, my dog.

41:49.407 --> 41:51.853
One day I got so hungry, I...

41:52.976 --> 41:55.424
...ate my dog.

42:02.152 --> 42:03.876
Okay, you win.

42:10.061 --> 42:12.974
Stop. <i>Para, para, para, para, para.</i>

42:14.398 --> 42:15.978
Beer?

43:03.481 --> 43:05.136
Turkey!

43:05.416 --> 43:09.097
- Hey.
- I got here as fast as I could.

43:10.654 --> 43:12.211
So...

43:12.691 --> 43:14.679
...where is John?

43:14.759 --> 43:17.849
To be honest, I don't know.

43:17.929 --> 43:21.652
I'm pretty low on the pecking order,
but I hear that he's somewhere important.

43:21.732 --> 43:24.626
So who is he sending to help?

43:26.905 --> 43:28.793
I'm the cavalry.

43:29.473 --> 43:32.564
Sheila, baby, we are so screwed.

43:32.644 --> 43:36.568
"And though she be but little, she is
fierce." I've made us an appointment.

43:37.308 --> 43:38.974
- Okay. Yeah. Good.
- Yeah.

43:39.054 --> 43:41.506
- Who is coming for...
- G'day!

43:41.986 --> 43:43.575
Here he is.

43:43.655 --> 43:46.207
Mr. Enry, Clive Muggleton.

43:46.557 --> 43:49.597
- I'm your case officer.
- Jesus.

43:50.477 --> 43:53.936
Those are some white teeth,
you know that? They're beautiful.

43:54.016 --> 43:56.854
It reminds me of high-grade cocaine.

43:57.370 --> 43:59.057
- Yeah.
- Hi. You must be Miss Monahan.

43:59.137 --> 44:02.140
Well, we spoke on the phone,
so thanks very much for coming down here.

44:02.220 --> 44:06.065
A pleasure to put a face to the voice
and a body to that face.

44:07.245 --> 44:10.412
Sorry. I'm doing a course on misogyny
to stop all that. That just popped out.

44:10.492 --> 44:14.005
- Won't happen again.
- About my situation...

44:14.085 --> 44:16.575
Yes, here's the blurb.
Layem international consultants.

44:16.655 --> 44:19.111
We're a full-service
executive security agency.

44:19.191 --> 44:22.547
We do it all, from debugging offices
to providing expertise in planning...

44:22.627 --> 44:26.818
...and here's the part you'll like,
executing ransom and retrieval operations.

44:26.898 --> 44:30.154
What if something happens to Sheila?

44:30.234 --> 44:34.616
Well, I'll find the bastards responsible,
and I'll bring you their heads in a bag.

44:36.807 --> 44:40.832
I... I don't think I want the head in a bag.

44:42.112 --> 44:44.853
- Where would I put it?
- The fridge.

44:45.483 --> 44:47.038
Yeah.

44:47.118 --> 44:50.569
I mean this completely as a compliment,
but you have the perfect-sized knockers.

44:50.649 --> 44:53.981
I mean, they're just the size.
Sorry, won't happen again.

44:55.292 --> 44:56.898
- Okay.
- So...

44:56.978 --> 45:00.319
- ...she tells me you're in some sort of band?
- He's in Metal Assassin.

45:00.399 --> 45:04.289
Well, I can't say I've heard of him,
but I'm into Crowded House, INXS, AC/DC...

45:04.369 --> 45:06.257
...both the Minogues, Dannii and Kylie.

45:06.337 --> 45:08.727
All right, enough chit-chat.
I'm gonna do some recon.

45:08.807 --> 45:12.030
I'll meet you in the afternoon.
Stay out of trouble, super boobs.

45:12.110 --> 45:15.156
I'm sorry. That one is a step over the line.

45:19.016 --> 45:21.463
Sir? Okay.

45:28.091 --> 45:31.917
Okay. I want you to consider
a hypothetical situation.

45:31.997 --> 45:33.819
You're presented with two doors.

45:33.899 --> 45:37.556
Behind door number one,
germ-infested pile of fecal matter.

45:37.636 --> 45:40.058
The closer you get
to this mound of excrement...

45:40.138 --> 45:44.063
...you see that it's teeming with
prostitutes, thieves, and pickpockets.

45:44.143 --> 45:47.799
- Sounds like my front door.
- Behind door number two...

45:47.879 --> 45:52.434
...suitcase full of nice,
clean U.S. cash dollars.

45:52.514 --> 45:56.130
- That sounds better.
- Well, which door would you take?

45:59.588 --> 46:02.694
Okay. The money over shit.

46:02.774 --> 46:05.904
Okay, I have a way to make
both of our dreams come true.

46:05.984 --> 46:09.188
You know what I would do if I had $1 million?

46:09.968 --> 46:13.918
I'd go get myself a little dosa cart.
Sell dosas all day long.

46:14.938 --> 46:18.563
- I have no idea what that is.
- Okay.

46:19.343 --> 46:23.224
<i>I want you to follow Mr. Enry.
I need to know his every move.</i>

46:25.349 --> 46:27.429
<i>Buenos días, señora.</i>

46:33.123 --> 46:37.048
This is awesome. Awesome.
Love it. I'm gonna buy it from you.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.942
I don't understand this arrangement at all.

47:15.364 --> 47:17.222
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

47:17.762 --> 47:21.282
Well, all right, gorgeous. G'day.

47:22.006 --> 47:23.895
How are you enjoying Valparaiso?

47:23.975 --> 47:27.966
Yeah, it's like, San Fran meets
South Beach, only mucho grosser.

47:28.046 --> 47:30.051
So it's a bit like Nottingham really.

47:31.181 --> 47:34.372
Look, I'm just gonna say it.
You look unbelievable in those pants.

47:34.452 --> 47:37.698
Five-star ass. And there, that's me done.

47:38.422 --> 47:40.234
Gin and tonic?

47:41.109 --> 47:44.216
Right, back to business. The U.S. government.

47:44.296 --> 47:47.565
They've got their heads up their ass.
The kidnappers aren't terrorists.

47:47.645 --> 47:49.407
- How do you know that?
- I just know.

47:49.487 --> 47:52.391
I reckon that some blokes just got lucky.
They went fishing for tourists.

47:52.471 --> 47:56.694
They nabbed the wife of a rock star.
I reckon they're shittin' themselves.

47:56.774 --> 47:58.413
So what should we do?

47:58.493 --> 48:01.572
Pay the ransom, get your wife back.

48:01.979 --> 48:04.793
Get laid, not necessarily in that order.

48:04.873 --> 48:07.960
All right, we'll pick it up tomorrow.
In the meantime, stay off the phones.

48:08.040 --> 48:10.265
We want them out of the loop.

48:12.455 --> 48:15.113
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Yeah, yeah.

48:15.193 --> 48:17.005
I'll see you later.

48:30.374 --> 48:33.798
I'm Agent Harding. I got five words for ya.

48:34.178 --> 48:36.358
Drop the Enry case.

48:40.784 --> 48:43.388
Drop the Turk Enry case.

48:43.888 --> 48:46.324
- What do you care?
- I might have some friends in Washington...

48:46.404 --> 48:48.927
...who would be interested in pulling
some lucrative middle-east contracts...

48:49.007 --> 48:52.821
...once they find out their guy in Chile
screwed the pooch on a terrorism case.

48:52.901 --> 48:56.855
Screwed the pooch?
You guys still saying that?

48:56.935 --> 48:58.779
Oh, yeah.

49:01.571 --> 49:03.195
Okay.

49:03.275 --> 49:05.764
Well, great. Let's go.

49:05.844 --> 49:08.366
No, no, no. Wait. Hold on, hold on.

49:08.446 --> 49:11.258
I thought you couldn't wait
to get out of here?

49:11.850 --> 49:13.861
That guy is amazing.

49:15.685 --> 49:17.532
So passionate.

49:19.423 --> 49:22.898
And he's killing it,
and no one seems to give a shit.

49:28.266 --> 49:30.011
He's the real deal.

49:31.902 --> 49:33.915
Look at him.

49:38.575 --> 49:40.682
He lives for music.

49:57.929 --> 50:02.210
Sorry, sorry. Let me just write
this down while it's still in my head.

50:04.402 --> 50:08.025
I'm not gonna sugar the pill.
I don't have great news.

50:08.605 --> 50:10.227
Sheila?

50:10.307 --> 50:13.898
No, the U.S. government.
They put pressure on the company.

50:13.978 --> 50:15.663
They won't let me take the case.

50:15.743 --> 50:18.236
Is it because of that terrorist crap, right?

50:18.316 --> 50:20.738
Yep, yep. For what it's worth, it's bullshit.

50:20.818 --> 50:25.063
Am I supposed to let her rot while they
decide what the hell they want to do?

50:25.143 --> 50:27.661
- They already have my million dollars!
- Excellent. Excellent.

50:27.741 --> 50:30.992
Now stay angry, and I want you to
listen to me, all right? Hit the table.

50:31.072 --> 50:32.734
Why?

50:32.814 --> 50:35.703
There's a guy over there.
He's been following us.

50:35.883 --> 50:37.328
Act angry.

50:37.408 --> 50:41.145
But I can't act unless I'm high
and I'm surrounded by dolphins.

50:41.225 --> 50:45.380
- I just need you to do it, okay?
- I'm so angry, and...

50:45.460 --> 50:48.683
- ...and... and, shit!
- Yeah, well, company...

50:48.763 --> 50:51.549
...can't take the case, but I will.

50:51.629 --> 50:54.222
No, I'm... pissed off!

50:54.302 --> 50:56.525
My fee's half million dollars
wired to this account.

50:56.605 --> 51:00.409
Go to hell, you marsupial-fellating dingo!

51:00.841 --> 51:01.883
I'm sorry.

51:01.963 --> 51:04.644
Don't know if you're jerking my crank
or his, but the racial stuff, mate...

51:04.724 --> 51:07.822
- ...that's a bit... you know?
- I was carried away...

51:07.902 --> 51:10.104
...you didgeridoo douchebag!

51:10.184 --> 51:14.409
God, mate! I can't help ya!
You used-up wannabe has-been!

51:14.489 --> 51:18.769
You didn't have to get personal,
man, okay? It really hurts.

51:19.993 --> 51:23.197
My men stole it from a junkyard.

51:24.697 --> 51:27.866
- They should have left it there.
- Watch out.

51:29.369 --> 51:32.814
You need to be careful when tacking.
The boom is always on the move.

51:33.474 --> 51:37.164
- You can sail?
- Yeah. I was raised in the fjords of Sweden.

51:37.244 --> 51:40.601
Oh, I realize I have much to learn.

51:40.681 --> 51:43.131
I should not be captain.
You should be captain.

51:44.251 --> 51:47.942
- Okay, take the tiller.
- Yes, of course.

51:48.022 --> 51:49.867
Which one's the tiller?

51:52.558 --> 51:55.413
- This is the tiller. I knew it.
- Yeah.

51:55.493 --> 51:57.975
We'll make a pirate of you yet.

51:58.799 --> 52:01.702
Also, you're gonna need a hat.

52:01.782 --> 52:03.748
A pirate hat.

52:08.509 --> 52:12.367
Filthy, sickening mountain
of vile putrefaction.

52:12.447 --> 52:14.902
You wanted to see me, sir?

52:14.982 --> 52:16.721
Yes, I did.

52:19.953 --> 52:22.510
There are currently two scenarios
that could work in our favor.

52:22.590 --> 52:25.064
One, something terrible happens to Turk Enry.

52:25.144 --> 52:28.316
He can't get the money, he can't pay
the ransom, they're stuck with a hostage.

52:28.396 --> 52:32.820
Scenario two... kidnappers
get jumpy, they kill Sheila.

52:32.900 --> 52:37.161
Now, I can't control scenario two,
but I can control scenario one.

52:37.241 --> 52:39.027
Oh, yes, yes. I understand.

52:39.107 --> 52:42.329
I'm suggesting that we take out Turk Enry...

52:42.409 --> 52:44.632
...but I need a way to do it and stay safe.

52:44.712 --> 52:49.193
Like how I stay safe from your snake?
I stay far away.

52:49.883 --> 52:51.696
You're a genius, Ramon.

52:53.119 --> 52:54.933
I don't know this word.

52:56.390 --> 53:00.514
That's a red-striped coral snake.
It's more deadly than a cobra.

53:00.594 --> 53:03.651
One drop of its venom
paralyzes every muscle in the body...

53:03.731 --> 53:05.986
...making normal organ function impossible.

53:06.066 --> 53:09.079
This job has become very strange, sir.

53:11.339 --> 53:15.897
Hello. I would like to arrange
a hot tub treatment...

53:15.977 --> 53:18.299
- Jacuzzi. Jacuzzi.
- I got this.

53:18.379 --> 53:22.403
- ...for a very special friend of mine.
- Amigo. Amigo, right?

53:23.483 --> 53:26.574
Yep. Yeah, just say it.

53:26.654 --> 53:30.678
<i>Sí. Exacto, un jacuzzi para Turk.</i>

53:30.758 --> 53:33.948
<i>Gracias. Sí.</i>

53:34.028 --> 53:35.984
- That's it?
- Yeah.

53:36.864 --> 53:40.512
Here's your towel, sir.
Anything you need, please call me.

53:44.304 --> 53:46.183
All right.

53:50.477 --> 53:54.392
- Beer?
- Beer! Yes, that's my guy.

53:55.448 --> 53:57.261
Thank you.

54:15.534 --> 54:18.222
Hello, there. Yeah.

54:36.590 --> 54:38.102
No!

55:02.283 --> 55:05.386
Hey! What the fuck?

55:05.466 --> 55:06.998
Hey!

55:22.352 --> 55:24.374
- You are very lucky.
- No. Yeah?

55:24.454 --> 55:25.759
He saved you.

55:25.839 --> 55:29.544
Plus the snake has died from what we
can only assume is alcohol poisoning.

55:30.844 --> 55:32.356
Doc...

55:33.313 --> 55:35.603
...will I be able to have sex again?

55:36.383 --> 55:39.207
No sex for at least three months.
Are you married?

55:39.287 --> 55:43.678
- Yeah, but she has been held hostage.
- Well, that made things easier, right?

55:43.758 --> 55:46.754
- Yeah.
- Mr. Enry. This has...

55:48.294 --> 55:50.741
...this just arrived for you.

55:52.365 --> 55:54.211
Thank you, Ramira.

55:57.504 --> 55:59.010
Mate.

55:59.590 --> 56:01.672
How you doin'?

56:01.942 --> 56:04.265
I can't imagine the pain you're in.

56:04.345 --> 56:06.501
Bitten right on the tip of your jizzpipe.

56:06.581 --> 56:10.324
His dick has been in thousands
of dangerous places. He'll be fine.

56:10.404 --> 56:12.473
You have no idea how he's feeling, love.

56:12.553 --> 56:14.475
It's one of the many advantages
of having a vagina.

56:14.555 --> 56:17.125
It's highly unlikely you're gonna
get bitten on the end of it.

56:17.205 --> 56:19.220
Please stop talking about my poisoned cock.

56:19.300 --> 56:23.217
I had a mate sleeping rough in the bush,
passed out one night, hammered...

56:23.297 --> 56:27.588
...woke up the next morning to
discover a dingo had eaten his ball.

56:28.068 --> 56:30.257
Took it clean off.

56:30.337 --> 56:31.856
Must got a taste for it, too.

56:31.936 --> 56:34.368
Came back the next day, took the other.

56:34.808 --> 56:36.365
Clive.

56:37.578 --> 56:40.867
Right, look, it's all pretty straightforward.
Take the money to the coordinates...

56:40.947 --> 56:42.770
...go alone, seems pretty adamant about that.

56:42.850 --> 56:46.240
We'd better listen to them, you know?
They have already killed twice.

56:46.320 --> 56:48.976
The only danger is gonna be
the drop-off, and I'll handle it.

56:49.056 --> 56:52.814
When we do get the money, the less time we
spend with that in our possession, the better.

56:52.894 --> 56:56.550
All right, you know, it was hard
enough getting the first million.

56:56.630 --> 56:59.186
Did you know they make you count it?

56:59.266 --> 57:03.480
Anyway, we do anything suspicious,
and Harding's gonna be all over us.

57:11.010 --> 57:14.011
What's the matter? Snake got your penis?

57:16.217 --> 57:18.839
- Yeah.
- Just kidding.

57:18.919 --> 57:21.165
I think I'm having an idea.

57:21.909 --> 57:23.338
Yeah.

57:24.524 --> 57:27.081
- This is how we are gonna get the money.
- One million dollars...

57:27.161 --> 57:30.518
First of all... I use my tapped cell phone...

57:30.598 --> 57:35.389
...to arrange the money to be delivered
to the same bank as last time.

57:35.469 --> 57:38.927
Yeah, so then I make a call
on your behalf from a pay phone...

57:39.007 --> 57:41.596
...and arrange for the money
to be sent to a different bank.

57:41.676 --> 57:44.432
Exactly! How tall are you, Clive?

57:44.512 --> 57:46.560
Standard specification sex machine, mate.

57:46.640 --> 57:48.469
Me, too.

57:48.549 --> 57:52.123
Now, I'm gonna wear this
when I go and collect the money.

57:52.203 --> 57:54.576
- That's a bloody beautiful shirt, mate.
- Glad you like it.

57:54.656 --> 57:57.411
<i>Agent Harding will be on our tail.</i>

57:57.491 --> 57:59.313
Follow that car!

57:59.393 --> 58:03.217
<i>So make sure, Turk, you arrive
at the bank ten minutes early...</i>

58:03.297 --> 58:06.654
<i>...giving you time to go into
the bar next door to the bank.</i>

58:06.934 --> 58:10.781
And you bring... this stuff with you.

58:11.372 --> 58:13.150
As per your list.

58:16.109 --> 58:18.933
This salt shaker is me.

58:19.013 --> 58:22.616
These two butter cups are you and Clive.

58:22.696 --> 58:25.573
And this peanut is Ben Harding.

58:26.053 --> 58:29.677
- What's the bottle of beer?
- That's my bottle of beer.

58:29.757 --> 58:32.002
The plan there is I drink it.

58:33.793 --> 58:35.672
It's good.

58:41.968 --> 58:43.998
<i>So Agent Harding is at the bank...</i>

58:44.078 --> 58:46.194
And he needs to be kept there
as long as possible.

58:46.274 --> 58:49.697
Now, since you do a lot
of undercover spy stuff...

58:49.777 --> 58:53.080
...I am assuming you have
a collection of various disguises.

58:53.160 --> 58:57.538
Disguises, got the lot.
What do you want? Beards or gums?

58:57.618 --> 59:00.470
Ball caps? Spectacles? Testicles?

59:00.550 --> 59:03.376
You can disguise a man's a testicles?

59:03.456 --> 59:06.337
Sure. A man's own testicles
can be a real giveaway.

59:06.417 --> 59:10.100
- Really?
- Sorry, where do you buy fake testicles?

59:10.180 --> 59:11.758
Amazon.

59:21.708 --> 59:24.485
G'day, Agent Harding. Where you goin'?

59:25.245 --> 59:28.102
- Where is he?
- Is what he'll probably say.

59:28.182 --> 59:31.428
I don't know who you're talkin' about, sir!

59:32.386 --> 59:35.299
<i>Marybeth, keep an eye on Harding.</i>

59:35.379 --> 59:37.345
<i>And let me know when he's heading my way.</i>

59:37.425 --> 59:41.882
He'll be there in eight minutes.
Repeat, eight minutes.

59:41.962 --> 59:45.353
Over and out. Bye.

59:45.733 --> 59:48.122
There's only one other bank
that can handle that kind of cash.

59:48.202 --> 59:50.558
It's not gonna take them long
to work out where you are.

59:50.638 --> 59:53.193
Right on. I just have to be quick.

59:53.273 --> 59:55.134
All right, guys.

59:55.976 --> 59:58.799
$1 million, right here.

59:59.179 --> 01:00:01.001
And back here.

01:00:01.081 --> 01:00:05.005
Rock 'n roll, man! Very good.
That was awesome. Awesome.

01:00:05.725 --> 01:00:07.601
Damn it!

01:00:21.834 --> 01:00:24.812
And that's how we steal a million dollars.

01:00:24.892 --> 01:00:28.045
But we're not stealing it.
It's already yours.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:32.132
Fine! You know, that's how we
make a withdrawal from a bank.

01:00:32.212 --> 01:00:33.933
It doesn't sound as good.

01:00:34.013 --> 01:00:38.386
Then I do the drop, you get
your wife back, we're all set. Simple.

01:00:38.466 --> 01:00:39.940
I know exactly where he's going.

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:43.411
There's no way this idiot had more
than one new idea in a week.

01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:47.086
To the <i>El Amor</i> bar and brothel.
There's an extra 20 U.S. cash dollars...

01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:49.010
...if you know a shortcut.

01:00:53.232 --> 01:00:55.912
Hey, dingo! Come on!

01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:05.624
Yeah!

01:01:15.923 --> 01:01:19.548
- Honey, honey, honey.
- One more time. I will give you for free.

01:01:19.628 --> 01:01:21.482
- Just one more time. <i>Por favor.</i>
- I can't.

01:01:21.562 --> 01:01:24.321
Five's my limit.
I've got no more fluid left in me.

01:01:24.401 --> 01:01:27.602
And I might have got...
myself a little bit off track!

01:01:42.014 --> 01:01:45.105
Hey, have you seen a little girl?
Solid eight out of ten? She was...

01:01:45.185 --> 01:01:47.407
- Clive Muggleton.
- Shit.

01:01:47.487 --> 01:01:51.168
I thought I told you to get off of this case.

01:02:44.744 --> 01:02:46.590
Good morning.

01:02:57.590 --> 01:02:59.462
I've got disease!

01:03:20.479 --> 01:03:23.527
American government! Get out of my way!

01:03:39.333 --> 01:03:41.912
What are you doing? You're a federal agent!

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:52.790
Fuck!

01:03:54.381 --> 01:03:57.187
What's wrong? Allergic to shellfish?

01:03:57.517 --> 01:04:00.397
As a matter of fact, I am.

01:04:01.022 --> 01:04:04.001
It's tight. You bastard!

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:34.731
How about some shrimp on the Barbie?

01:04:35.255 --> 01:04:38.512
How's that taste? How about some octopus?

01:04:38.592 --> 01:04:42.238
You got that on the Great Barrier Reef?

01:05:02.582 --> 01:05:04.461
Oh, my God!

01:05:10.156 --> 01:05:11.968
It's time.

01:05:12.526 --> 01:05:13.981
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:05:14.061 --> 01:05:15.905
Let's go.

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:37.195
Are you okay, Marybeth?

01:05:39.753 --> 01:05:41.608
Deep breaths, Marybeth.

01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:44.534
Deep breaths.

01:05:45.825 --> 01:05:48.615
I mean, I thought he was a douchebag...

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:53.500
...but he was the kind of douchebag
that always said nice things about my bum.

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:56.023
That's a hell of a eulogy.

01:05:56.803 --> 01:05:58.825
What do we do now?

01:05:58.905 --> 01:06:02.161
Well, I guess I'll make the drop.

01:06:02.241 --> 01:06:03.480
I'll have to do it.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.434
But you... but you'd need to take a boat...

01:06:06.514 --> 01:06:10.237
- ...and find the right location.
- Well, I'll be fine.

01:06:10.317 --> 01:06:12.129
Let's see where I'm going.

01:06:13.419 --> 01:06:18.578
All right. All I have to do is just take
a boat and go from this dot thing...

01:06:18.658 --> 01:06:24.139
...through this tunnel thing
and meet this thing that looks like a...

01:06:24.631 --> 01:06:26.209
...dildo.

01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:35.452
Thanks for the suitcase. It was...

01:06:38.110 --> 01:06:40.768
Do you think I can do this?

01:06:40.848 --> 01:06:42.470
- I know you can, Turk.
- Yeah?

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:44.965
Yeah. Go get your wife.

01:06:45.045 --> 01:06:46.503
Yeah.

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:48.231
All right.

01:06:51.924 --> 01:06:55.772
Hey, kid. Are you all right?

01:06:58.163 --> 01:07:01.012
- Beer.
- No.

01:07:01.092 --> 01:07:02.979
It's not the time.

01:07:06.505 --> 01:07:08.728
Maybe just one for the road.

01:07:10.308 --> 01:07:12.726
Make it two. Yep.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.868
Very good.

01:07:33.466 --> 01:07:35.509
No harm will come to you...

01:07:35.589 --> 01:07:37.882
...as long as your husband cooperates.

01:07:39.706 --> 01:07:42.329
My life is in the hands of my husband?

01:07:42.909 --> 01:07:45.989
- Yes.
- It was nice knowing you.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.440
He once wrote a self-help manual
entitled Bark Yourself Happy.

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.310
It was based on the idea that, and I quote...

01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:58.371
"...Dogs don't get depressed."

01:07:58.451 --> 01:08:01.191
Surely your husband is a capable man.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:06.163
Shit!

01:08:12.939 --> 01:08:14.495
Clive!

01:08:14.675 --> 01:08:16.429
Clive!

01:08:16.509 --> 01:08:19.049
Calm down, love. No time for a stiffy.

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:21.764
- Clive, you were... you were dead!
- Yeah.

01:08:21.844 --> 01:08:25.283
- What's wrong with your neck?
- Harding tried to break it.

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:30.567
I faked it.

01:08:32.192 --> 01:08:35.505
- And your eyes?
- Forced entry by shrimp.

01:08:36.162 --> 01:08:39.152
Hold on. So when I...
when I found you, you were alive?

01:08:39.232 --> 01:08:43.022
Yeah. Sorry, love. You were leaning right
over me. I could see straight down your top.

01:08:43.102 --> 01:08:44.680
Couldn't bear to end it.

01:08:45.809 --> 01:08:47.928
Crikey. Yeah, where's Turk?

01:08:48.028 --> 01:08:49.701
Oh, he's there.

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:54.390
Oh, he's out of his depth.

01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:56.725
Physically and metaphorically.

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:03.210
Well, what are you gonna do?
Swim? You can't turn your head.

01:09:03.290 --> 01:09:06.173
This one's for love. Also money.

01:09:06.252 --> 01:09:08.939
All right. I'll need a pursuit vehicle.

01:09:10.564 --> 01:09:11.885
Coming with you.

01:09:11.965 --> 01:09:14.955
Tactical combat suit, medium, check.

01:09:15.035 --> 01:09:18.125
Gun, check. Camouflage paint, check.

01:09:18.205 --> 01:09:22.721
GPS, check. Grenade, check. Power bar, check.

01:09:23.142 --> 01:09:24.654
Okay.

01:09:32.952 --> 01:09:36.432
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:53.371 --> 01:09:54.801
There you are.

01:10:10.322 --> 01:10:12.135
All right.

01:10:13.342 --> 01:10:14.905
Okay.

01:10:18.264 --> 01:10:21.712
Sheila! I'm coming for you!

01:10:23.835 --> 01:10:27.624
- Can you see him?
- All I can see is top left sky.

01:10:51.797 --> 01:10:55.078
The dildo. I mean, the statue.

01:11:16.041 --> 01:11:18.405
We have got a slight problem.

01:11:21.126 --> 01:11:22.972
Goddamn it.

01:11:27.299 --> 01:11:29.913
I am Turk Enry!

01:11:30.803 --> 01:11:36.163
I brought the money!
It's in this horrible suitcase!

01:11:36.243 --> 01:11:38.722
This suitcase doesn't belong to me.

01:11:44.516 --> 01:11:47.196
Hello, kidnappers!

01:11:48.621 --> 01:11:50.200
Hello?

01:11:55.361 --> 01:11:56.616
You?

01:11:56.696 --> 01:12:00.860
You couldn't do what you were told, could ya?
All you had to do was nothing...

01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:03.356
...and you couldn't even do that.

01:12:03.766 --> 01:12:06.850
You can't kill me. I am English.

01:12:07.473 --> 01:12:11.965
Part Spanish and technically Chilean,
and I live in Malibu.

01:12:12.045 --> 01:12:13.500
It's all very confusing, man.

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.962
Why didn't you just give me
the million dollars and walk away?

01:12:16.042 --> 01:12:19.930
Because it's not about the money!
It's about my wife!

01:12:22.155 --> 01:12:23.833
God!

01:12:25.223 --> 01:12:27.636
Shit, shit! Shit!

01:12:28.227 --> 01:12:31.084
You don't deserve
any of this stuff that you got.

01:12:31.164 --> 01:12:33.226
You were in a has-been rock band.

01:12:33.306 --> 01:12:37.580
You play the bass.
It's only got four strings.

01:12:44.542 --> 01:12:46.799
God! My head!

01:12:46.879 --> 01:12:48.691
Have a beer!

01:12:56.422 --> 01:12:59.278
The bass is the heartbeat of a band.

01:12:59.358 --> 01:13:02.314
- Stay there!
- G'day, Turk.

01:13:02.404 --> 01:13:05.518
- You're dead, man! You're dead!
- You shouldn't be dealing with this.

01:13:05.598 --> 01:13:08.024
- I'll take it from here.
- Shit! Just hide!

01:13:08.104 --> 01:13:10.487
Go! Both of you! Out!

01:13:15.107 --> 01:13:18.698
I hope they didn't see us.
Have you got an eye on Turk?

01:13:18.778 --> 01:13:21.067
Well, that seems to be one benefit
of this neck situation.

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:23.393
I can see perfectly around corners.

01:13:26.918 --> 01:13:28.793
Good afternoon.

01:13:29.808 --> 01:13:31.266
Hi.

01:13:32.826 --> 01:13:36.183
Hey, you were supposed to come alone, man!

01:13:36.263 --> 01:13:41.678
I was trying to, but other than
these two, I am completely alone.

01:13:43.356 --> 01:13:45.302
And him. I forgot about him.

01:13:45.382 --> 01:13:48.848
And my M204 A5 hand grenade.

01:14:04.624 --> 01:14:06.502
Damn it!

01:14:09.728 --> 01:14:11.701
- Shit!
- Get down!

01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.520
Oh, yeah, the neck.

01:14:25.645 --> 01:14:27.856
Yeah. That's a bit grubby.

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:33.730
Goodbye, Ben Harding. I'm sorry.

01:14:35.387 --> 01:14:39.562
- Mr. Enry, may I ask you a question?
- Sure.

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:41.982
Do you think Metal Assassin
will get back together?

01:14:42.062 --> 01:14:46.085
I don't think so.
Besides, I have other projects.

01:14:46.165 --> 01:14:49.779
No, wait, wait, wait. So you're going solo?

01:14:50.602 --> 01:14:52.662
I am trying to, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:52.742 --> 01:14:56.363
You're a true artist.
You will find your new voice.

01:14:56.443 --> 01:15:00.266
Just listen to what is in your heart.

01:15:00.346 --> 01:15:03.559
- It will tell you.
- Yeah.

01:15:11.389 --> 01:15:13.202
I miss my wife.

01:15:16.962 --> 01:15:20.020
Probably I miss her more than she misses me.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.521
She's the most important thing in my life.

01:15:24.601 --> 01:15:26.527
She's the glue that...

01:15:26.607 --> 01:15:30.666
...puts together all the pieces
of the person that is...

01:15:31.164 --> 01:15:32.693
...me.

01:15:33.245 --> 01:15:35.565
And I need to tell her that.

01:15:35.645 --> 01:15:39.806
So that's why you...
you have to give her back to me.

01:15:40.586 --> 01:15:42.842
I love Sheila.

01:15:42.922 --> 01:15:45.000
And Sheila loves you.

01:15:50.329 --> 01:15:52.175
Oh, God.

01:15:55.233 --> 01:15:57.390
Pay no heed to my erection.

01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:00.683
I am a sex addict, but not homosexual.

01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:04.353
Let's just...

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:07.156
...go.

01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:27.176
Baby.

01:16:32.307 --> 01:16:34.117
Are you okay?

01:16:34.807 --> 01:16:36.686
I'm fine.

01:16:37.976 --> 01:16:40.633
You know I may be an idiot, but...

01:16:41.413 --> 01:16:44.838
...I know that fine is never fine.

01:16:45.818 --> 01:16:48.064
Why should I go with you?

01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:51.991
Well, I... I don't know.

01:16:52.071 --> 01:16:55.581
- Because I love you.
- Love me?

01:16:55.662 --> 01:16:57.451
- Love me?
- Yes.

01:16:57.531 --> 01:17:00.400
You can barely stand to be around me
since Metal Assassin broke up.

01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.956
- What? No.
- You don't need me.

01:17:03.036 --> 01:17:05.458
You think I don't need you?

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:07.427
Are you kidding?

01:17:08.407 --> 01:17:11.531
I can't do anything without you. I'm a mess.

01:17:11.611 --> 01:17:16.502
All I've done is to think about
what a total asshole I have been.

01:17:16.582 --> 01:17:18.508
I wrote a song!

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:24.377
You haven't been able to write
since the band broke up.

01:17:24.457 --> 01:17:26.947
I wrote a song for you.

01:17:28.327 --> 01:17:30.156
Prove it.

01:17:30.236 --> 01:17:33.887
- Like... like, right here? Now in...
- Yes, right here! Right here!

01:17:33.967 --> 01:17:38.391
- If you can't make a single gesture, then I...
- Goddamn it! Okay. I'll prove it.

01:17:38.471 --> 01:17:40.166
All right?

01:17:40.246 --> 01:17:41.743
<i>Muchacho</i>, I need...

01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:53.196
Ridiculous.

01:17:54.886 --> 01:17:56.292
All right.

01:19:07.292 --> 01:19:10.950
It's just the chorus, but it's a start.

01:19:12.130 --> 01:19:14.543
- It's a start.
- Yeah.

01:19:16.134 --> 01:19:19.960
I feel like we are having a moment here...

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:24.387
...but I have some news about my penis.

01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:33.973
I've had $2.5 million vacations
with fatalities before...

01:19:34.053 --> 01:19:38.031
...but goddamn, this one was
interesting, you know? Hey, Ramira.

01:19:38.111 --> 01:19:43.453
We are gonna need... a couple
of in-room massages and tons of beer.

01:19:44.396 --> 01:19:46.352
<i>Un momento</i>. Let me check her schedule.

01:19:46.432 --> 01:19:48.988
All I need is a hot shower
with no one watching.

01:19:49.068 --> 01:19:52.481
All I need is you, baby.

01:19:53.306 --> 01:19:57.531
And oysters, caviar, and champagne. Yeah.

01:19:57.611 --> 01:20:00.634
I don't need money.
I don't need fame. I don't need John.

01:20:00.714 --> 01:20:03.136
I'm sorry. We can't make
any more charges to your room.

01:20:03.216 --> 01:20:04.994
Your accounts have been frozen.

01:20:05.074 --> 01:20:09.099
Marybeth, can you find John for me, please?

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:25.669
Bad news. John is gone.

01:20:25.749 --> 01:20:29.562
He's drained four of his clients'
bank accounts and disappeared.

01:20:30.442 --> 01:20:31.698
Shit.

01:20:31.778 --> 01:20:34.494
What, does that mean I don't get paid?

01:20:35.514 --> 01:20:37.732
- No.
- Crap.

01:20:37.812 --> 01:20:41.130
I just... I just want to go home.

01:20:41.210 --> 01:20:45.501
Hold on, Turk. Who exactly
has been paying your mortgage?

01:20:47.059 --> 01:20:48.608
Sheila!

01:21:12.349 --> 01:21:14.807
- Just use your phone, baby.
- No way.

01:21:14.887 --> 01:21:17.810
I want this to be like my old touring days.

01:21:17.890 --> 01:21:20.887
Besides, the data is just too expensive.

01:21:20.967 --> 01:21:22.415
Okay.

01:21:22.495 --> 01:21:26.176
From now on, I'm going to be your CGI.

01:21:27.066 --> 01:21:30.322
It's not CGI. It's GPS.

01:21:30.402 --> 01:21:32.415
Yeah. Well, that too.

01:21:37.776 --> 01:21:41.107
<i>And now something from my new album!</i>

01:21:41.187 --> 01:21:45.789
I wrote this song
in a very hard time of my life.

01:21:52.891 --> 01:21:55.081
I was alone and scared...

01:21:55.161 --> 01:21:58.475
...and then I lost the most
important thing in my life...

01:22:00.432 --> 01:22:02.946
...the use of my penis.

01:23:23.449 --> 01:23:26.262
And so it begins.

01:23:29.386 --> 01:23:30.900
Thanks.

01:23:39.497 --> 01:23:41.088
No.

01:23:42.168 --> 01:23:44.981
No one is gonna find me here.

01:23:48.239 --> 01:23:51.287
Well, this is very nice.

01:24:05.790 --> 01:24:09.615
Careful when tacking.
The boom is always on the move.

01:24:09.695 --> 01:24:11.507
<i>Sí, captain.</i>

01:26:45.776 --> 01:26:47.362
Baby.

01:26:49.587 --> 01:26:53.045
Have I ever been to India?

01:26:53.125 --> 01:26:56.769
- No. Not India. No.
- No?

01:26:56.849 --> 01:27:00.910
I just had a Bollywood experience.

01:27:04.201 --> 01:27:06.048
We can go now.

01:27:10.141 --> 01:27:11.964
Sheila is right.

01:27:12.744 --> 01:27:16.359
These dolphins should not be caged.

01:27:17.882 --> 01:27:19.548
Dolphins!

01:27:19.628 --> 01:27:22.074
Come, dolphins. Come.

01:27:24.254 --> 01:27:27.179
Swim free, sweet dolphins.

01:27:27.259 --> 01:27:31.551
Such beautiful and gentle creatures.

01:27:32.231 --> 01:27:34.309
Peace and love.

01:27:37.969 --> 01:27:40.015
Time for a power bar.

01:27:54.086 --> 01:27:56.242
Back off! Please, God!

01:27:56.322 --> 01:27:59.748
Stop! Mine! This is my power bar!

01:28:00.959 --> 01:28:03.449
You fuckin'... go, get off!

01:28:04.629 --> 01:28:06.875
I will mace you!

01:28:23.047 --> 01:28:25.727
Oh, God! It's got doll's eyes!

01:29:16.568 --> 01:29:20.816
Yeah, that's about it.
It's a beautiful place?

01:29:21.674 --> 01:29:23.996
Oh, and I don't know
if you read up on this place...

01:29:24.076 --> 01:29:26.899
...but it used to belong
to some kind of rock star.

01:29:26.979 --> 01:29:29.135
You know what? I love it.

01:29:29.215 --> 01:29:32.271
- Congratulations, Mr...
- My name is Ramon.

01:29:32.351 --> 01:29:34.372
And what did you say you do?

01:29:34.452 --> 01:29:38.310
I have a dosa cart.
Well, I used to have a dosa cart.

01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:41.791
Now I have 3,000 dosa carts.

01:29:42.794 --> 01:29:45.905
Yep. Things are looking up.

01:29:50.703 --> 01:29:53.659
<i>Well, if it isn't my favorite</i> chica caliente!

01:29:53.739 --> 01:29:57.463
<i>I'm going to assume that's offensive.
Listen, Clive, what's the news on John?</i>

01:29:57.543 --> 01:29:59.231
- <i>He got away.</i>
- <i>He got away?</i>

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:02.701
<i>We used the wrong kind of snake. Turns
out all it did was make his dingle grow.</i>

01:30:02.781 --> 01:30:06.272
<i>He should send me a thank you card.
Anyhow, John's on the move.</i>

01:30:06.352 --> 01:30:08.807
- <i>The sparrow is in the sky.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

01:30:08.887 --> 01:30:10.743
<i>He's hired a private jet. He's outta here.</i>

01:30:10.823 --> 01:30:13.012
- <i>So we've lost him?</i>
- <i>Maybe not.</i>

01:30:13.092 --> 01:30:18.283
<i>Turns out masculine Harmony have a large
and extremely bad-tempered second cousin.</i>

01:30:18.363 --> 01:30:20.419
- <i>Nice fella. Russian.</i>
- <i>So?</i>

01:30:20.499 --> 01:30:22.857
- <i>You know what the second cousin does?</i>
- <i>Surprise me.</i>

01:30:22.937 --> 01:30:25.013
<i>He charters out a private jet.</i>

01:30:37.081 --> 01:30:39.302
Shouldn't you be flying the plane?

01:30:40.785 --> 01:30:42.208
- I won't fight you.
- Why not?

01:30:42.288 --> 01:30:44.386
Because I'm no good at fighting.

01:31:05.342 --> 01:31:07.189
English man.

01:31:07.578 --> 01:31:09.091
Hey!

01:31:31.176 --> 01:31:33.859
When it comes to umbrellas, my friend...

01:31:33.939 --> 01:31:36.518
...never fuck with an Englishman.
