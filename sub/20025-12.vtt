WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.807 --> 00:11.010
This time round, boss Anna's
sent in eight fresh newbies.

00:11.077 --> 00:14.214
She's asked for our help to choose
which one is gonna live

00:14.280 --> 00:16.583
and work with wuh forever.
Oi, oi!

00:16.649 --> 00:19.386
I'm not gonna be able to
keep yous all on full time.

00:19.452 --> 00:23.022
We've been pushing for which one
we want to live with.

00:23.089 --> 00:26.726
Who's the radgiest of radge packets?
(all) Oh!

00:28.628 --> 00:31.331
What are you doing?
You're at work, man.

00:32.365 --> 00:35.034
My ex bird Sarah is one of
the three newbies left.

00:37.971 --> 00:38.972
(laughs)

00:39.606 --> 00:42.675
I'm feeling a little bit horny,
so I'm gonna treat myself.

00:44.210 --> 00:48.281
Seeing Marty with another girl,
I don't know if can take it.

00:48.348 --> 00:50.784
Don't get angry,
then you're not bothered.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.852
I'm getting angry cos he thinks I am.

00:52.919 --> 00:55.288
I don't wanna see her mug
herself off again.

00:55.355 --> 00:59.025
I'm telling you to shut the fuck up,
cos I don't care!

00:59.893 --> 01:03.696
Fucking hell,
I'm gonna get snapped tonight.

01:03.763 --> 01:06.433
Me and Scott took things
to the next level.

01:08.968 --> 01:13.406
Scott's been juggling Abbie, Sarah
and Zahida. The fucking idiot.

01:13.473 --> 01:14.941
Yeah, spit in my mouth.

01:15.008 --> 01:17.076
Eh?! Spit in your mouth?

01:17.143 --> 01:18.445
(laughs)

01:18.511 --> 01:20.780
Only one person is staying.
What?!

01:20.847 --> 01:24.184
It's now or never.
The gloves are off.

01:26.052 --> 01:28.121
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:28.188 --> 01:30.557
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:30.623 --> 01:33.326
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:33.393 --> 01:35.662
Get me in,
cos I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.764
I'm preened to perfection.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.300
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:40.366 --> 01:43.169
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:43.236 --> 01:46.039
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:46.105 --> 01:49.542
Me quiff's pure lethal
and me banter's pure naughty.

01:49.609 --> 01:52.145
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:01.521 --> 02:04.090
Morning fucking wood.
(laughs)

02:04.157 --> 02:07.126
Last night, me and Scott
had sex for the first time.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.228
And I loved it.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.531
The way things are going,
who knows what could happen next?

02:15.134 --> 02:19.205
Mans got his dick wet last night.
Oh!

02:19.272 --> 02:21.708
Oh... shit, son.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.777
I'm telling the boys that
I shagged Sarah last night.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.881
How the fuck did it happen?
Chloe's not gonna be happy.

02:27.947 --> 02:30.950
There's the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Oi!

02:31.551 --> 02:34.420
The question on everyone's lips is,
did you shag?

02:34.487 --> 02:35.655
Aye, I did.

02:35.722 --> 02:38.324
Aaron's asking if I banged Abbie.
Course I did.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.627
All that graft
finally fucking paid off.

02:40.693 --> 02:44.130
You've just eventually banged Abbie
and you've banged Sarah.

02:44.197 --> 02:46.599
Only one of them three
is gonna be staying.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.068
Makes it even fucking
more interesting.

02:49.135 --> 02:52.939
I knew picking which newbie stays
for good would be a tight decision.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.607
This race is getting juicy.

02:58.411 --> 03:01.047
Morning, everyone.
Morning. Morning.

03:01.114 --> 03:02.382
How are we all feeling?

03:02.448 --> 03:03.716
Very hungover.

03:03.783 --> 03:06.819
What even happened last night?
Was there kicking off?

03:06.886 --> 03:09.322
Cos I went to bed.
Martin tried to shag Sarah.

03:09.389 --> 03:11.024
And she said no?

03:11.090 --> 03:14.494
I don't know what happened.
Would you be affected if they did?

03:14.561 --> 03:17.497
It won't affect us that much
to kick off.

03:17.564 --> 03:20.900
Chloe, I argued with you last night,
and you're still lying.

03:20.967 --> 03:24.404
I know you care,
so just admit it to everyone now.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.105
You will be fucking bothered.

03:26.172 --> 03:28.841
Let's not argue over Sarah and Marty,
Nathan.

03:28.908 --> 03:30.243
There's no point.

03:30.310 --> 03:33.947
I know I said I wouldn't be bothered
if Marty and Sarah did have sex,

03:34.013 --> 03:35.615
but I actually would be hurt.

03:35.682 --> 03:39.852
Mine and Marty's friendship should
mean more than him shagging an ex.

03:39.919 --> 03:42.722
I need to go and have a look,
see what they're doing.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.591
Come on, Chloe. Let's be nosy.

03:50.597 --> 03:54.467
Sarah walks into the living room
with a little grin on her face.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.102
How was your sleep?

03:56.169 --> 03:59.238
I want to know exactly what happened
with her and Martin.

03:59.305 --> 04:02.542
Do you know what? Fuck it.
I've had a rough time in here.

04:02.609 --> 04:06.212
I'm gonna treat myself.
(Sarah and Zahida laugh)

04:06.279 --> 04:09.415
Last night, I quite literally
had a blast from the past.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.618
And even though it was
a little bit shit,

04:11.684 --> 04:14.687
after all the upset with Scott,
it was just what I needed.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.690
Quite average.

04:17.757 --> 04:21.361
You've got to be kidding me, like.
Have I heard what I think I heard?

04:21.427 --> 04:24.197
I think it was a bit of curiosity,

04:24.263 --> 04:27.400
a bit of a reaction to
what they've been doing.

04:27.467 --> 04:30.436
I don't feel like
I need to do it again.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.373
What's going on?

04:35.441 --> 04:37.844
Are you OK?
I'm perfectly fine.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.079
This could be awkward.

04:40.146 --> 04:42.148
I feel like you are upset, though.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.417
Sarah...
Chloe, I want you to be honest.

04:44.484 --> 04:45.518
I really do.

04:45.585 --> 04:47.453
Sarah, this is what I think of you.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.824
That's what I think of you.

04:51.891 --> 04:55.828
I know I shouldn't be taking this out
on Sarah. It's not her, it's Marty.

04:55.895 --> 04:57.764
Why do I feel so gutted about this?

04:57.830 --> 05:01.467
I feel like that sausage.
Chewed up, spat out,

05:01.534 --> 05:03.369
and fucking cold.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.477
(phone rings)

05:11.544 --> 05:14.080
The phone rings.
Only one person it's gonna be.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.215
We should unplug the fucking phone.

05:16.282 --> 05:17.784
Hello.
"Hiya, Gary."

05:17.850 --> 05:20.920
"After weeks of putting the newbies
through their paces,

05:20.987 --> 05:24.257
today the girls will do one last
job. Last chance to impress."

05:24.323 --> 05:26.726
"But this time,
they're going out alone."

05:26.793 --> 05:30.463
"I'm gonna be there to judge,
to see how well they get on." Yeah.

05:30.530 --> 05:34.267
"I'll then look at everything that's
happened over the past few weeks

05:34.333 --> 05:35.968
and what you guys have said,

05:36.035 --> 05:39.972
then I'll decide which one will
join you guys for good." OK.

05:40.039 --> 05:44.644
This is big. It's finally time
to pick which newbie stays for good.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.245
"Gary, that's not all."

05:46.312 --> 05:49.215
"Tell the girls to say their
goodbyes and get packing,

05:49.282 --> 05:52.418
because straight after work,
they'll be heading home."

05:52.485 --> 05:55.021
"And tomorrow,
only one of them will return."

05:55.088 --> 05:56.422
All right, bye.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.324
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.359
Hoo-hoo.

06:00.426 --> 06:01.661
I did not expect that.

06:01.728 --> 06:04.964
Of course, it would have to be me
who's got to break the news.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.366
This is gonna be horrendous.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.936
Right, there's a job today.

06:10.002 --> 06:13.606
But the people that are going to work
is just the newbies.

06:13.673 --> 06:17.643
Anna's gonna be there watching yous,
wants to see what yous have learnt.

06:17.710 --> 06:21.380
Shit! Anna's coming to watch us
at work. And this is the first time

06:21.447 --> 06:25.284
she's ever bothered to show up.
This must be serious. Time to shine.

06:25.351 --> 06:28.688
All three of you will go to work,
and then you'll go home.

06:28.755 --> 06:32.759
But only one of you will be returning
tomorrow as a permanent member

06:32.825 --> 06:33.960
of this family.

06:34.927 --> 06:37.897
This is the shittest news
I've ever heard.

06:37.964 --> 06:41.400
Not only do we have to go to work
and then go home,

06:41.467 --> 06:43.703
but only one of us is coming back.

06:43.770 --> 06:47.406
Anna's dropping bombs.
Your last chance to impress Anna.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.308
Just make sure you do your best.

06:49.375 --> 06:53.346
Look, it's been nice, but
unfortunately... go and pack

06:53.412 --> 06:58.084
cos you've got work. That phone call
has made everything feel so real.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.086
Now it's judgement time.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.454
Go, girls.
Go, go, go.

07:01.521 --> 07:03.356
Go and pack.
I'll give you a hand.

07:10.229 --> 07:13.533
We're packing up wuh stuff,
and it's getting really emotional

07:13.599 --> 07:17.003
knowing that two of wuh aren't
gonna come back. (doorbell rings)

07:17.069 --> 07:19.972
Hello, sexy. Thank you.

07:20.039 --> 07:23.709
The door goes, with some dog costumes
that the newbies have to wear.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.411
I've got you some costumes.

07:25.478 --> 07:28.614
What the hell is Anna gonna
make these newbies do?

07:28.681 --> 07:30.449
She is barking mad.

07:30.516 --> 07:34.287
I don't get why we've got onesies.
Anna wants us to look like a cock.

07:34.353 --> 07:36.989
We're all packed up
and ready for work.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.859
I can't believe it's finally
time to say goodbye.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.295
Especially dressed as a fucking dog.

07:46.232 --> 07:49.302
Your whiskers are on fleek.
I know. I look cute, don't I?

07:49.368 --> 07:51.170
Ow.
Oh, look at yous!

07:51.237 --> 07:53.105
Yous look like... animals.

07:53.172 --> 07:54.841
In a good way.
Yous look cute.

07:54.907 --> 07:57.610
The girls are all packed
and ready to go to work.

07:57.677 --> 07:59.779
These newbies have got
a lot to prove,

07:59.846 --> 08:02.682
because whoever ends up joining
the family forever

08:02.748 --> 08:04.617
have got to be the dog's bollocks.

08:04.684 --> 08:05.785
Good luck, Zahida.

08:05.852 --> 08:08.654
Me and Scotty have been through
a lot in this house.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.057
I just hope,
whatever Anna's decision is,

08:11.123 --> 08:13.125
it's not the end of the road for us.

08:13.192 --> 08:14.327
I'll see ya.
Yeah.

08:15.194 --> 08:18.497
I can tell by the look on Abbie's
face she doesn't wanna go home.

08:18.564 --> 08:21.734
Why would she? Last night she
realised dreams can come true.

08:21.801 --> 08:24.670
Does it feel mad that
only one of yous is coming back?

08:25.972 --> 08:28.641
Basically, kill or be killed,
bitches. (laughs)

08:28.708 --> 08:31.844
The newbies have come a long way
since they first walked in.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.946
They're all winners in my eyes.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.015
Get yourselves away. Good luck.

08:36.082 --> 08:39.885
We'll see one of yous tomorrow.
See one of yous tomorrow. (all) Bye.

08:39.952 --> 08:41.486
Buh-bye.
Have a good 'un.

08:42.121 --> 08:45.625
Aww. I feel a bit emotional.
Bye!

08:45.691 --> 08:47.793
I wonder which one
will be coming back.

08:50.563 --> 08:52.198
One more job.
Yeah.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.333
I'm in it for myself. (laughs)

08:54.400 --> 08:57.503
Today is our last chance
to prove ourselves.

08:57.570 --> 09:01.307
And I'm gonna do everything to show
Anna I should be the one to stay.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.776
You girls are late.
(all) Sorry.

09:03.843 --> 09:07.880
Now you're here, I've got
a really big event on tonight.

09:07.947 --> 09:10.249
So I need you to sell it for us,
right? Right.

09:10.316 --> 09:11.918
What the hell is this shit?

09:11.984 --> 09:15.454
I can't believe Anna has got us
standing in the middle of town,

09:15.521 --> 09:18.157
wearing dog onesies
and handing out leaflets.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.659
Go on, go to work, girls.

09:19.725 --> 09:21.727
Hello.
We've got an amazing event on.

09:21.794 --> 09:23.829
We're doing a dog racing event.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.364
Do yous wanna come here?

09:25.431 --> 09:27.667
Right. Oh, this is
a fucking nightmare.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.302
A big party, a big event.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.170
Loads of food, loads of peev.

09:31.237 --> 09:34.407
I'm chucking flyers about
like there's no tomorrow.

09:34.473 --> 09:36.042
I am a promo queen.

09:36.108 --> 09:39.946
Bring a couple mates.
Free buffet, cheap drinks.

09:40.012 --> 09:42.648
I think I smell,
cos everyone's just swerving.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.717
(both) All reet, lads?
(laughs)

09:44.784 --> 09:47.853
I am working my 32D tits off.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.288
I am shattered.

09:49.355 --> 09:51.157
This better be worth it.

09:51.223 --> 09:54.226
Girls, come back here now.
I'd like yous all to go home,

09:54.293 --> 09:58.464
and I'm gonna be in touch once I've
decided who I want to be full time.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.067
Anna says she still needs to decide.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.703
Fuck me, I don't know if
I can take it any more.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.639
OK? Thanks for all your hard work.
Yous did a great job.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.674
Bye, girls.
(all) Bye.

10:09.475 --> 10:13.079
I'm so glad work has come to an end
and Anna's fucked off.

10:13.145 --> 10:16.315
But now it means it's time to
say goodbye to the girls.

10:17.316 --> 10:18.918
We've done all we can.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.987
Let the best girl win.

10:26.325 --> 10:29.729
The anticipation of finding out
which newbie is going to stay

10:29.795 --> 10:32.999
is killing us. But we're not gonna
find out till tomorrow.

10:33.065 --> 10:36.936
So tonight, we need to forget it
and just go out and get mortal.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.342
I'm excited that
it's just us tonight.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.878
Family night is always
incestuous night.

10:45.945 --> 10:49.248
What does that mean? When everyone
starts kissing each other.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.318
I will not be necking on with anyone.
Not even Martin?

10:52.385 --> 10:55.621
No, definitely not. I would
never do that to myself again.

10:55.688 --> 10:59.492
I haven't spoke to Marty all day,
and I'm really hurt with what he did.

10:59.558 --> 11:02.495
But I know for a fine fact
I'm not gonna get an apology,

11:02.561 --> 11:05.331
cos he thinks that little
of our friendship.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.334
You know since I haven't seen
my boyfriend in a while?

11:08.401 --> 11:12.138
Would you be offended if I
maybe just kissed your penis?

11:12.204 --> 11:14.340
Please, Nathan,
just one little kiss.

11:14.407 --> 11:16.609
Poor Sophie is a fanny in need
right now.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.677
And I'm a charitable soul,

11:18.744 --> 11:21.414
so who am I to deny this
penis-shaped request?

11:21.480 --> 11:22.848
Fancy a preview?

11:22.915 --> 11:23.983
Here...
Yes.

11:24.050 --> 11:25.384
...here...
Yes.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.087
...or here?

11:28.154 --> 11:29.855
Oh. I think I like the last one.

11:29.922 --> 11:31.724
The top one?
Yeah.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.993
Well, tonight's gonna be
a good night.

11:38.664 --> 11:42.735
We're getting ready, and Turbo T's
looking exceptionally fucking lush,

11:42.802 --> 11:45.704
but I cannot help but wonder
how the newbies got on.

11:45.771 --> 11:48.340
Where did you leave things
with Abbie? (laughs)

11:48.407 --> 11:51.844
Where does your head lie? We've
never actually talked about it.

11:51.911 --> 11:55.281
We just left. If we're out tonight
and there's some birds,

11:55.347 --> 11:56.949
would you go on the pull?

11:57.016 --> 11:59.785
(sighs) Is it too soon? Is it not?

11:59.852 --> 12:02.855
It's family night,
and you don't pull on family night.

12:02.922 --> 12:05.257
But pulling, to Scott,
is like breathing.

12:05.324 --> 12:06.859
He just can't help himself.

12:06.926 --> 12:09.562
This is the last time it'll be us.
How mad's that?

12:09.628 --> 12:13.299
Cos tomorrow, there's gonna be
another person here permanently.

12:13.365 --> 12:14.467
That feel mad.

12:14.533 --> 12:16.168
It's fucking family night.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.971
Means we're gonna go out,
get smashed and enjoy it

12:19.038 --> 12:20.840
with no fucking arguments.

12:20.906 --> 12:22.241
Yes!

12:22.308 --> 12:25.344
Originals.
(all) Originals!

12:26.512 --> 12:28.647
We need to make
the most out of tonight,

12:28.714 --> 12:32.485
because tomorrow our family's
expanding forever. Bring it on.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.623
Why am I such a sex machine?

12:37.690 --> 12:41.260
There's only two things on my mind,
penis and kebab.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.661
Oh!

12:42.728 --> 12:45.431
All hail King Nathan's birthday!

12:47.032 --> 12:50.136
I'm sure I've just heard
a car pull up. (all cheer)

12:55.007 --> 12:55.207
.

12:57.710 --> 12:57.910
.

13:09.955 --> 13:13.292
We get to the club, and it is
bouncing. Let's get the drinks in

13:13.359 --> 13:15.628
and get this family night
started in style.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.400
Tonight feels like old times.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.236
It's just the family,
and I'm fucking loving it.

13:38.284 --> 13:42.254
Marty and Chloe
still haven't spoken.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.990
I'm so glad me and Marnie
are best friends again.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.666
I look at Marnie and Aaron,
and I can't help but be jealous

13:53.732 --> 13:55.734
at how good their friendship is.

13:55.801 --> 13:58.971
I wish me and Marty could
get to that place,

13:59.038 --> 14:02.107
but I still haven't spoke to him
since he shagged Sarah.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.343
Come on, Marty,
what have you got to say?

14:11.850 --> 14:14.320
Chloe comes over,
and she's after an apology.

14:14.386 --> 14:17.289
I really don't understand
what I'm saying sorry for.

14:31.103 --> 14:34.573
I do care about Chloe, she's been
one of my best mates for years.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.642
I don't know what
she wants us to say.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.245
I'm single and I haven't
done anything wrong.

14:41.447 --> 14:44.283
I need to get Chloe's mind
off Martin,

14:44.350 --> 14:47.319
and what better way to do that,
with some drinks?

14:54.593 --> 14:56.428
I'm having a pure wicked night.

14:56.495 --> 14:59.531
And some naughty lass in the club
has just caught my eye.

14:59.598 --> 15:01.667
I know I only bucked Abbie
last night,

15:01.734 --> 15:04.770
but it'd be rude not to grace
this bird with my presence.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.805
I am providing a public service.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.744
Scott's pulled,
and I've got to give it to him,

15:11.810 --> 15:15.247
he's got some serious balls.
Cos if Abbie comes back tomorrow,

15:15.314 --> 15:17.650
she'll be wearing them balls
as earrings.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.086
I need to get this bird home,
pronto.

15:21.153 --> 15:23.489
I want some quiet
one-on-one time with her

15:23.555 --> 15:27.359
to discuss politics, the environment
and her thoughts on Brexit.

15:28.994 --> 15:33.766
Abbie's bed isn't even cold yet,
and Scott has left the club

15:33.832 --> 15:34.933
with another girl.

15:37.136 --> 15:38.971
The boy has no respect.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.277
I'm first back,
and I'm gonna go see my pal.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.579
All reet, Shag Pad?
How you doing, mate?

15:47.646 --> 15:51.583
Might as well name it Scotty T's
bedroom, I spend half my life here.

15:56.288 --> 16:00.559
Everyone's mortal. This is when
family nights are at their best.

16:03.829 --> 16:06.265
I'm steaming drunk
and I'm feeling frisky.

16:06.332 --> 16:09.168
I might have a boyfriend,
but necking on with Chloe?

16:09.234 --> 16:10.602
He won't mind.

16:12.037 --> 16:16.842
I am so drunk. Marnie wants us,
even if Marty doesn't.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.677
Why am I such a sex machine?

16:24.850 --> 16:26.685
I am loving family night tonight.

16:26.752 --> 16:29.888
I love Chloe,
I love Sophie, I love Aaron.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.890
A little cuddle won't hurt, will it?

16:39.865 --> 16:42.267
Fucking hell,
Marnie's fucking mortal.

16:42.334 --> 16:44.803
I think it's time
we got her out of here.

16:52.411 --> 16:54.713
Aaron! Aaron, get the cunt out.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.949
(sighs)

16:57.015 --> 16:58.484
Every time, Marns.

16:58.550 --> 17:00.819
I get home,
I don't know where I'm at,

17:00.886 --> 17:03.489
what my name is.
I'm fucking mortal.

17:03.555 --> 17:06.858
It's nice to know that
it doesn't matter what happens,

17:06.925 --> 17:08.727
Aaron'll always have my back.

17:08.794 --> 17:12.397
Bum up. Right. Goodnight.

17:12.464 --> 17:16.068
Shock, Marnie's fucked. And guess
who ends up putting her to bed.

17:16.135 --> 17:20.806
Me. Whatever happens between us,
some things never change.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.909
Why've you got that on your head?
Make a violin out of it.

17:23.976 --> 17:27.579
What the fuck are you doing with
your violin on your head, divvy?

17:27.646 --> 17:31.784
I get back to the house, and
there's only two things on my mind.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.452
Kebab and dick.

17:33.519 --> 17:37.956
Yay! Nathan, how would you feel
if I ate some kebab off your cock?

17:38.023 --> 17:40.559
Oh! Don't get mistaken
for the fucking bean.

17:40.626 --> 17:42.060
Come here, Nathan.

17:42.127 --> 17:44.563
I know it's not your birthday
till tomorrow,

17:44.630 --> 17:47.766
but I know I can definitely
eat some kebab off your willy.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.735
Let's see how gay Nathan is.

17:49.802 --> 17:54.139
Nathan, if you get a hard-on,
you're not gay.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.842
Nathan, Nathan...
Sophie, get it in your mouth.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.945
Oh!

18:00.012 --> 18:03.215
Hey, Soph, do you want some
special sauce with that?

18:03.282 --> 18:05.717
Lick the ball sack!
Get it out of his pants.

18:05.784 --> 18:09.288
What the fucking hell is that?
(indistinct)

18:09.354 --> 18:10.389
Oh!

18:10.456 --> 18:14.126
I've heard about late-night
munchies, but this is ridiculous.

18:14.193 --> 18:16.361
I think it's time
we all went to bed.

18:16.428 --> 18:20.365
Hopefully, when I wake up, what I've
just seen will be a distant memory.

18:31.477 --> 18:34.012
So, this bird's saying
I'm the full package,

18:34.079 --> 18:37.716
yet she's only commenting on my
eyes. Hope she's got a big letterbox

18:37.783 --> 18:41.253
cos I'm about to deliver a package
the size of a fucking leg.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.321
That's fine.

19:01.707 --> 19:04.109
Morning!

19:04.176 --> 19:05.177
(groans)

19:05.244 --> 19:08.013
All hail King Nathan's birthday!

19:08.080 --> 19:12.117
Birthday! Birthday! Birthday!
Boy!

19:12.184 --> 19:14.019
(coughs, vomits)

19:14.086 --> 19:18.690
What better way to start your
birthday than a tactical chunder?

19:18.757 --> 19:20.526
Fucking hell, I'm rough.

19:20.592 --> 19:23.061
But I don't care,
cos it's my birthday!

19:23.128 --> 19:24.997
Scott pulled a bird.
Did he?

19:25.063 --> 19:27.733
Abbie has been gone five minutes.

19:27.799 --> 19:29.735
If Anna does bring her back,

19:29.801 --> 19:32.771
I'm sorry, she's not human
if she doesn't kick off.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.973
It could be Zahida. Yeah.
We don't know.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.608
I can't wait to find out.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.810
I need to get over this hangover
quick.

19:38.877 --> 19:42.014
Cos not only is there a newbie
joining the family forever,

19:42.080 --> 19:45.217
it's also Nathan's birthday.
Today is gonna be epic.

19:45.284 --> 19:49.621
What about... a vagina pile-up!

19:49.688 --> 19:53.492
What better present than to have
three beautiful-looking vaginas

19:53.559 --> 19:54.693
on your face?

19:54.760 --> 19:56.295
Happy birthday, Nathan.

19:56.361 --> 19:59.097
(laughter)
Smells like fish.

19:59.164 --> 20:03.235
This is the worst birthday wake-up
call I've ever had in my life.

20:06.405 --> 20:09.608
Did you and Chloe make up?
Chloe kept going,

20:09.675 --> 20:12.444
"You do realise we will
never be friends again

20:12.511 --> 20:15.480
cos you shagged Sarah?"
I was like, "Chloe, we'll see."

20:15.547 --> 20:18.984
I hate it when Chloe's angry at me,
but I'm just hoping,

20:19.051 --> 20:21.453
if I give her some space,
she'll soon realise

20:21.520 --> 20:24.423
she can't live without us.
We've been mates forever.

20:24.489 --> 20:27.559
Scott, who was that bird?
I came back here, right?

20:27.626 --> 20:30.696
And she's just like, "I'm gonna go."
I was like, "Sweet."

20:30.762 --> 20:33.498
I knew if I shagged her,
it would have caused bother.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.201
Oh, fuck off, Scott.
You did not think...

20:36.268 --> 20:38.737
She pied you.
You just didn't get a shag.

20:38.804 --> 20:42.407
As if Scott didn't bang that girl
cos he had a conscience over Abbie.

20:42.474 --> 20:44.943
I cannot wait to see
which newbie comes back.

20:45.010 --> 20:50.048
Fucking Scott, bacon and egg,
red sauce, on the double.

20:54.252 --> 20:57.022
I don't think she...
Watch your fingers.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.524
(laughs)

20:59.591 --> 21:02.494
I'm presenting my birthday boy
with his breakfast.

21:02.561 --> 21:05.564
I don't wanna sound big-headed,
it looks professional.

21:05.631 --> 21:07.799
I just hope it doesn't
give him the shits.

21:07.866 --> 21:11.770
Oh, King Nathan?!
King Nathan, your breakfast awaits!

21:11.837 --> 21:14.573
I could actually get used to
this lifestyle.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.209
I wish it was my birthday
every fucking day.

21:17.275 --> 21:20.679
Well, listen, because it's obviously
Nathan's birthday,

21:20.746 --> 21:23.782
let's just have
a massive party tonight.

21:23.849 --> 21:25.884
Yeah!

21:25.951 --> 21:29.655
Yes! And I know just
the perfect theme, too.

21:29.721 --> 21:32.557
Right, the theme... '80s, baby.

21:32.624 --> 21:34.159
I'm an '80s kid!

21:34.226 --> 21:36.895
Am I?
Fuck me, yous must be old.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.598
'80s! '80s! '80s!

21:39.665 --> 21:41.700
I am buzzing for this house party.

21:41.767 --> 21:44.536
But we haven't heard a peep
out of Anna the Spanner,

21:44.603 --> 21:47.706
and I really wanna know
who's joining the family for good.

21:47.773 --> 21:50.242
Are they gonna come to the party?
Yeah, baby.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.015
We have gotta get ready
for my birthday party.

21:57.082 --> 21:58.684
We've got a lot to do.

22:00.118 --> 22:01.687
We need costumes.

22:02.487 --> 22:03.689
All reet?

22:04.556 --> 22:07.259
Massive '80s theme party.

22:07.325 --> 22:09.261
We want neon lights.
Neon lights.

22:09.327 --> 22:11.797
We need cake, we need guests,
and we need a DJ.

22:11.863 --> 22:14.533
And luckily enough,
I have a boyfriend

22:14.599 --> 22:17.402
who can spin some fucking wheels.

22:17.469 --> 22:20.439
What, are you the boy
that's a really good DJ?

22:20.505 --> 22:24.076
I'm the girl that might give you
a BJ whilst you're DJing.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.446
Is this '80s?
No, that's Scottish.

22:29.448 --> 22:31.483
I don't want you to wear that.

22:31.550 --> 22:34.519
Got wuh costumes, so it's time to
head back to the house

22:34.586 --> 22:36.988
and show everyone
what goodies we've got.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.997
Oh, my God!
Yay!

22:46.064 --> 22:49.267
Nathan's '80s party is almost here,
and I am buzzing.

22:49.334 --> 22:53.038
The decorations have already came.
Now it's time to get costumed up.

22:53.105 --> 22:57.175
The new iPhone 7 is here.
Brring, brring. Hello!

23:04.349 --> 23:06.585
I fucking love these outfits.

23:06.651 --> 23:10.222
I've got a daft jacket on,
Marty's wearing a shell suit.

23:10.288 --> 23:13.458
Don't know what Gary and Aaron
have come as. They look like

23:13.525 --> 23:15.761
Tweedledum and
Tweedle-fucking-divvy.

23:15.827 --> 23:19.264
(Gary and Aaron) Hands in the air
if you're on the pull.

23:19.798 --> 23:20.799
Like it.

23:20.866 --> 23:23.268
House parties are
the easiest place to pull.

23:23.335 --> 23:26.505
When Chloe's getting distracted,
I can nip off for a neck on.

23:26.571 --> 23:31.176
Sometime tonight we're gonna
find out who Anna has chosen.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.813
I'm not sure if it's gonna be Abbie
or Zahida. I couldn't give a fuck.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.982
I either am fucked, or I fuck them.

23:37.048 --> 23:39.217
(both) No, mate, you're fucked.

23:39.284 --> 23:42.621
Whoever comes back
could cause potential drama.

23:42.687 --> 23:44.422
I just hope that doesn't happen.

23:44.489 --> 23:46.525
All we want is a good last night.

23:46.591 --> 23:48.059
Ronald.
Reggie.

23:48.126 --> 23:50.128
(laughter)

23:52.364 --> 23:55.700
We've pulled it out of the bag,
haven't we, for the '80s theme?

23:55.767 --> 23:58.203
The '80s was an era I'd
have liked to live in.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.505
Did they have lights?
Electric lights?

24:00.572 --> 24:03.041
Babes, it wasn't the trenches.

24:03.108 --> 24:06.444
Did Nathan seriously just ask if
they had lights in the '80s?

24:06.511 --> 24:08.413
No lights on in his head today.

24:08.480 --> 24:11.583
Nathan, who do you think you
look like tonight? Me dad.

24:11.650 --> 24:14.186
(laughter)

24:14.252 --> 24:16.855
Nathan's wig is absolutely mint.

24:16.922 --> 24:20.625
But it's time to show him what we've
done to the rest of the house.

24:20.692 --> 24:23.361
Right...
Keep 'em closed!

24:23.428 --> 24:25.664
Keep 'em closed
until we get to the area.

24:25.730 --> 24:28.700
Nathan hasn't even had
his best surprise yet.

24:28.767 --> 24:31.870
And I cannot wait to see his face
when he sees the cake.

24:33.038 --> 24:36.541
Right, what you wanna do is,
I want your finger to go in.

24:36.608 --> 24:37.709
Go right in.

24:37.776 --> 24:38.877
Open your eyes.

24:39.711 --> 24:42.881
(all) Happy birthday!

24:42.948 --> 24:44.649
Happy birthday!

24:44.716 --> 24:47.485
This is fucking insane.

24:47.552 --> 24:49.087
It's amazing.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.622
It's flamboyant.

24:50.689 --> 24:51.957
It's fucking me.

24:52.023 --> 24:54.025
Go on, Nathan, finger it.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.265
Poo-poo le mange.

25:00.332 --> 25:03.268
Nathan's digging into his cake
like a pig in shit.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.570
But I'm sure I've just
heard a car pull up.

25:05.637 --> 25:07.973
Either we've got some
early party guests,

25:08.039 --> 25:11.610
or this is the moment we find out
which newbie is returning.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.148
(all cheer)

25:18.250 --> 25:20.819
Welcome to the family, kid.
(all cheer) Fuck.

25:20.886 --> 25:23.255
This party is fucking amazing.

25:23.321 --> 25:25.891
Why don't us four have a sleepover?

25:27.692 --> 25:29.160
(laughs)

25:29.227 --> 25:30.395
Oh, your fanny's out!

25:31.029 --> 25:33.131
Thank you. Thank you.

25:38.470 --> 25:38.670
.

25:41.206 --> 25:41.406
.

25:52.117 --> 25:54.452
I'm sure I've just heard
a car pull up.

25:54.519 --> 25:56.888
Either we've got some
early party guests,

25:56.955 --> 26:00.225
or this is the moment we find out
which newbie is returning.

26:03.228 --> 26:06.965
Let's get the guests in
and get this party fucking started.

26:10.669 --> 26:13.605
Someone's just barged through
the door. Who is it?!

26:13.672 --> 26:15.507
Hello!

26:15.573 --> 26:20.211
I'm back. I just hope the others
think Anna made the right decision.

26:20.278 --> 26:22.447
(all cheer)

26:22.514 --> 26:24.349
It's Abbie.

26:24.416 --> 26:25.784
Abbie! Abbie! Abbie!

26:26.484 --> 26:27.919
Abbie! Abbie!

26:27.986 --> 26:30.221
I'm fucking so happy for her.

26:30.288 --> 26:31.756
Welcome to the family, kid.

26:31.823 --> 26:33.525
I'm happy.
We're happy.

26:33.591 --> 26:36.661
I'm so happy I'm the one
to be welcomed back in the house

26:36.728 --> 26:38.596
as part of the family.

26:40.532 --> 26:45.103
I am buzzing it's Abbie. She's a
sound girl, she'll fit in perfectly.

26:45.170 --> 26:47.906
Scott,
looking a bit peaky there, lad.

26:49.307 --> 26:53.845
Now Abbie's back, I'm so excited to
tell her everything that's went on

26:53.912 --> 26:55.847
while she's been away. Fuck!

26:55.914 --> 26:58.917
Abbie, I'd like to say
welcome to the family officially.

26:58.984 --> 27:00.919
Are you buzzing?
Buzzing.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.188
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy it's you.

27:03.254 --> 27:05.290
You're one of the girls!
I know.

27:05.357 --> 27:08.760
Abbie, welcome to the house!
(all cheer)

27:08.827 --> 27:11.229
And also happy birthday, Nathan!

27:11.296 --> 27:12.697
(all cheer)

27:12.764 --> 27:17.402
Yes! My boyfriend's arrived.
That means we have a DJ.

27:17.469 --> 27:20.638
So it's time to get
this party started.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.044
Reggie.

27:30.849 --> 27:33.718
The girls are telling us
how happy they are to see us.

27:33.785 --> 27:34.919
This feels amazing.

27:37.555 --> 27:40.091
What a liberty,
Abbie's talking to the girls,

27:40.158 --> 27:43.328
it's only a matter of time
before this gans fucking off.

27:50.035 --> 27:51.770
Why is Scott being such a pussy?

27:51.836 --> 27:55.473
Just go and talk to Abbie, for fuck's
sake, before someone else does.

27:58.309 --> 28:01.179
I am having the best birthday ever.

28:01.246 --> 28:04.849
Not only is it my birthday,
but it's our last night together

28:04.916 --> 28:06.451
before we leave the house.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.686
Let's celebrate in style,
'80s style.

28:13.992 --> 28:15.894
This party is fucking amazing.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.396
Me and Gaz are loving
being dressed the same.

28:19.397 --> 28:21.499
(both laugh)

28:21.566 --> 28:23.401
We think we're fucking twins.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.282
Cheers, bitches.

28:37.348 --> 28:40.118
There's a lot of fit birds
at this house party

28:40.185 --> 28:42.854
and I'm dressed like a stud
in an '80s shell suit.

28:42.921 --> 28:45.557
Surely the birds can't
knock us back.

28:49.294 --> 28:52.163
I'm necking on with everyone.
This is unbelievable.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.140
Abbie? Abbie?

29:02.207 --> 29:04.375
I'm not gonna put this off
any longer.

29:04.442 --> 29:07.078
I'll grab Abbie and tell her
exactly what went on

29:07.145 --> 29:10.215
before one of the fucking girls
decides to stitch us up.

29:10.281 --> 29:11.516
Come outside.

29:12.117 --> 29:15.887
Shit. Scotty wants to take us
outside for a chat.

29:15.954 --> 29:17.288
This doesn't feel good.

29:17.355 --> 29:19.257
Did you miss us?
Well, yes.

29:19.324 --> 29:23.862
Did you? But, before you
come back into this house,

29:23.928 --> 29:26.698
I've gotta tell you something.
What have you done?

29:26.764 --> 29:29.567
Well, so last night,
when we all went out,

29:29.634 --> 29:33.805
I got a girl back. But nothing
happened at all. Listen...

29:33.872 --> 29:36.708
Oh, my God.
Scott, I've been gone one night.

29:36.774 --> 29:38.610
I know, but listen...
One night.

29:38.676 --> 29:41.880
Scotty's telling us that he
brought a girl back last night,

29:41.946 --> 29:45.783
but didn't have sex with her. I bet
it's cos she didn't want to, not you

29:45.850 --> 29:46.985
I can't believe it.

29:47.051 --> 29:49.053
I look like a fucking mug now.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.624
You fucked me over once,
and now you've done it again.

29:52.690 --> 29:54.893
Fuck off, Scott. Asshole.

29:55.760 --> 29:58.963
I cannot believe Abbie just
swilled us, the little divvy.

29:59.030 --> 30:02.567
I try to do the right thing, and
I just get it hoyed back in me face.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.270
Fuck Abbie.
I'm off to sort my eyeball out.

30:20.919 --> 30:23.655
I don't know why Abbie
expected any different.

30:23.721 --> 30:27.358
Scott is a pure creep.
I'm gonna take her under my armpit.

30:36.434 --> 30:38.703
I'm not letting Scotty ruin my night.

30:38.770 --> 30:42.440
This is my comeback, and me and
the girls are gonna celebrate.

31:01.726 --> 31:05.496
Me and Marnie are normally
at the centre of all the drama.

31:05.563 --> 31:07.298
It's nice to have a laugh with her

31:07.365 --> 31:10.468
and take the piss out of
all the radgies that are here.

31:11.469 --> 31:14.305
It's been so hard coming in
this time with a boyfriend

31:14.372 --> 31:17.609
and living with an ex. But me
and Aaron are having such a laugh,

31:17.675 --> 31:20.745
and we've finally got to
a place where we should be.

31:21.879 --> 31:25.717
This party is pure belter. But me
and Marty aren't really talking.

31:25.783 --> 31:29.220
If he can't respect me,
I'm gonna pretend I don't care.

31:29.287 --> 31:31.956
I don't need to have a boy
to have fun.

31:34.726 --> 31:35.760
(laughs)

31:37.328 --> 31:39.297
Chloe, what the fuck are you doing?

31:39.364 --> 31:41.132
Oh.

31:44.569 --> 31:47.639
Oh, your fanny's out!
Your fanny is actually out!

31:52.677 --> 31:54.679
That's the spare room.

31:54.746 --> 31:56.881
I'm having a wicked time
at this party.

31:56.948 --> 32:00.618
I don't wanna jinx it, but I think
I'm gonna have a three-ball here.

32:00.685 --> 32:02.453
It's time to get soggy, girls.

32:04.389 --> 32:07.625
If I pull this threesome off,
I'm gonna be a fucking legend.

32:10.161 --> 32:13.464
Marnie? We need to go outside now.
You're gonna die.

32:14.832 --> 32:16.434
You will die!

32:17.268 --> 32:20.338
I'm still upset with Martin
for what he did with Sarah.

32:20.405 --> 32:24.042
And now I can see him canoodling with
two girls right in front of us.

32:24.108 --> 32:25.877
That's not what friends do.

32:27.745 --> 32:31.683
All my Christmases, birthdays,
everything's come at once.

32:31.749 --> 32:32.784
This is amazing.

32:32.850 --> 32:36.321
The hot tub's just been done,
now bring on the Shag Pad.

32:42.527 --> 32:45.363
Thank you. Thank you.

32:51.235 --> 32:54.439
The party has been
a full-on success.

32:54.505 --> 32:57.208
And even better,
I've got my boyfriend here.

33:00.845 --> 33:04.215
I'm pissed out of my head.
I've had the best night of my life,

33:04.282 --> 33:06.184
but I just wanna go to bed.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.886
Right, girls and guys,
thank you for coming.

33:18.296 --> 33:21.933
This has been one of the best ends
to a crazy few weeks ever.

33:23.768 --> 33:25.002
(laughs)

33:25.069 --> 33:28.706
I've been pure MIA this whole house
party, cos I fell out with Abbie.

33:28.773 --> 33:32.176
I've come back to see Marty
having a threesome. What the fuck?

33:32.243 --> 33:35.313
I'm off to bed me, like,
cos I don't know what is going on.

33:37.815 --> 33:41.319
I can't help but get angry
over Marty and these two girls.

33:41.386 --> 33:44.655
Why do I always do this? Why do I
always show that I'm bothered?

33:44.722 --> 33:46.924
I feel like they look like
The Chipmunks.

33:46.991 --> 33:48.459
Do you know The Chipmunks?

33:48.526 --> 33:51.362
Come on, Marty,
have a little bit of respect.

33:51.429 --> 33:53.865
Chloe does still like you,
and you know that.

33:53.931 --> 33:58.102
Goodnight. Have a lovely,
lovely jubbly night.

33:58.169 --> 33:59.504
You're a sucker!

33:59.570 --> 34:01.839
I know I'm kicking off,
but I can't help it.

34:01.906 --> 34:04.308
Marty knows exactly
how to push my buttons.

34:04.375 --> 34:08.112
Fuck off and goodnight! Suck on this.

34:14.351 --> 34:16.987
Things still aren't sorted
between me and Scott,

34:17.054 --> 34:18.656
but I've had a wicked night.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.759
It's time to go to bed
as an official family member.

34:25.596 --> 34:28.366
Good morning!
I'm an expert on the vagine.

34:28.433 --> 34:30.368
You said you liked my bumhole.

34:30.435 --> 34:33.103
Stick a fork in me, mate, I'm done.
Give us a kiss.

34:33.170 --> 34:35.540
What's the chance of a quick blare?

34:35.606 --> 34:38.509
You've never cared about us.
(chatter)

34:38.576 --> 34:41.045
Time for wuh all to fucking bounce.
(laughter)

34:45.949 --> 34:46.150
.

34:48.686 --> 34:48.886
.

35:07.572 --> 35:09.207
Good morning!

35:09.273 --> 35:13.044
It's just dawned on me that you're
officially part of the house.

35:13.110 --> 35:15.213
This is your room.
How does it feel?

35:15.279 --> 35:16.647
I'm really happy.

35:16.714 --> 35:18.883
I hope yous are as well.
(all) Yeah.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.852
Last night was a head fuck.

35:20.918 --> 35:22.887
I was so happy to be
back in the house,

35:22.954 --> 35:26.357
but then I was so upset
when I found out Scotty had pulled.

35:26.424 --> 35:27.525
I'm so confused.

35:27.592 --> 35:29.827
One fuck given
after Martin last night?

35:29.894 --> 35:34.365
That's turned us off completely now.
Who the hell did he think he was?

35:34.432 --> 35:36.400
He thought he was Hugh Hefner.

35:36.467 --> 35:39.403
Marty literally thought
he was King Dick last night.

35:39.470 --> 35:41.572
But he's not. He is a loser.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.575
And so what I might have been
a bit jealous? Who cares?

35:44.642 --> 35:48.079
I couldn't give a flying fuck
about clearing the air with Marty.

35:48.145 --> 35:50.381
Cos I'm going home today
and I don't care.

35:50.448 --> 35:54.018
I want to believe Chloe when she
says it's the end of her and Marty,

35:54.085 --> 35:57.655
but I think she needs to be more
honest about the way she feels.

35:57.722 --> 36:00.758
(GROANS) I'm not even looking
forward to packing my bag.

36:00.825 --> 36:05.563
This time, being in the house,
has been a very, very different one.

36:05.630 --> 36:08.866
I'm not gonna miss the vaginas,
the boobs and the discharge.

36:08.933 --> 36:12.103
What about my bumhole?
You said you liked that. (laughs)

36:12.169 --> 36:14.906
If Anna ever sacks me,
I'm gonna be a gynaecologist.

36:14.972 --> 36:17.909
I'm now an expert on the vagine.

36:17.975 --> 36:21.012
I have got so much to pack.
Me too. We should get started.

36:22.079 --> 36:24.248
Haway, then, let's get started.

36:27.852 --> 36:28.986
How was it, Martin?

36:31.789 --> 36:34.225
You did well to get that
little threesome in

36:34.292 --> 36:36.761
without fucking letting
Chloe spoil it.

36:36.827 --> 36:39.797
Oh, mate.
She was trying her best, wasn't she?

36:39.864 --> 36:42.133
Last night was the best night
of my life.

36:42.199 --> 36:45.503
If Chloe was really my friend,
she would've been happy for us,

36:45.570 --> 36:48.039
but she was making digs
left, right and centre.

36:48.105 --> 36:51.809
I don't know what's wrong with her.
I am pleased it's Abbie.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.578
Definitely. She deserves it.

36:53.644 --> 36:56.047
She just looked happy, didn't she?
Aye.

36:56.113 --> 36:57.281
She was just buzzing.

36:57.348 --> 36:59.584
After all the shit
between me and Abbie,

36:59.650 --> 37:01.919
I need to speak to her
before we all go home.

37:01.986 --> 37:04.388
I hate leaving things
on bad fucking terms.

37:04.455 --> 37:06.924
Stick a fork in me, mate, I'm done.

37:11.162 --> 37:13.564
You look nice.
Thanks.

37:14.465 --> 37:16.567
You scrub up well, don't you?

37:16.634 --> 37:20.004
Scotty wants to talk. After
last night's chat, it wasn't great.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.572
I hope this one is better.

37:21.639 --> 37:25.109
I just wanna say sorry about
everything that happened.

37:25.176 --> 37:28.546
It won't happen again. I realise
how much of a dick I was being.

37:28.613 --> 37:30.348
It makes me look like a dick.

37:30.414 --> 37:34.518
I don't wanna ever make your time
in here shit, cos you deserve it.

37:34.585 --> 37:38.456
I don't know what it is about Scotty,
him being so nice is making me sad.

37:38.522 --> 37:40.825
I'm upset that he's ruined it for us.

37:40.891 --> 37:43.661
I know that all that
shit's happened, but...

37:43.728 --> 37:46.764
it's only two bad things.
There's been a lot of good.

37:47.765 --> 37:49.700
I am sorry for swilling you.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.469
But I think you deserved it.

37:51.535 --> 37:53.371
I did deserve it.
Yeah.

37:53.437 --> 37:55.439
You'll have to give us your number.

37:56.407 --> 37:57.575
Give us a cuddle.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.511
Give me a kiss.

38:01.712 --> 38:05.549
I know this is a long shot, but now
we've sort of sorted everything out,

38:05.616 --> 38:08.419
I wonder what the chances are of
having a quick blare.

38:08.486 --> 38:11.055
Come on, I'll help you
pack your knickers.

38:12.590 --> 38:13.824
Come on, big arse.

38:19.764 --> 38:21.966
I can't believe
I'm packing to go home.

38:22.033 --> 38:25.703
But before I go, I need to
speak to Chloe and sort this out.

38:27.705 --> 38:30.608
What was the reason for kicking off?
I didn't kick off.

38:30.675 --> 38:32.877
You were kicking off.
No, I wasn't.

38:32.943 --> 38:34.345
You were so bothered.

38:35.312 --> 38:37.748
You're embarrassing.
You're embarrassing.

38:37.815 --> 38:41.652
Sat there like fucking Hugh Hefner
with two lasses.

38:41.719 --> 38:43.487
That's what's embarrassing.

38:43.554 --> 38:48.025
And what's more embarrassing is
that I genuinely used to like you.

38:48.092 --> 38:51.896
I used to have feelings for someone
who's never had feelings for me,

38:51.962 --> 38:52.963
at all.

38:53.030 --> 38:55.299
Me and Marty have got
so much history.

38:55.366 --> 38:58.669
And at one point,
I thought he was my soulmate.

38:58.736 --> 39:02.106
It's took me so long
to actually see him as a friend.

39:08.612 --> 39:12.049
(crying) I just feel like you've
never, ever cared about us.

39:14.919 --> 39:18.289
Fuck. Seeing Chloe upset
makes me feel sick.

39:18.355 --> 39:21.392
I thought she was OK
with us just being mates.

39:23.294 --> 39:24.895
Fuck's sake. Come here.

39:24.962 --> 39:28.799
No, but you don't understand, Martin.
(sobs)

39:28.866 --> 39:31.368
I do care about you.
You don't. You never have.

39:31.435 --> 39:33.137
You've never cared about us.

39:33.204 --> 39:37.208
I thought me and you had something
really special. We get on so well,

39:37.274 --> 39:40.411
we're so alike. And I feel
like it's just been ruined.

39:40.478 --> 39:43.814
We both know that wuh
friendship's not done.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.383
I think me and Chloe's
got a lot more work to do

39:46.450 --> 39:49.453
before we get to the point
Marnie and Aaron are at now.

39:49.520 --> 39:51.122
Shall we have a cuddle?

39:52.556 --> 39:55.726
You know that I'll always care
about you. I love you to bits.

39:55.793 --> 39:57.294
You're one of my best mates.

39:57.361 --> 40:00.531
Sometimes you just get all,
like, fucking radgie. So do you.

40:00.598 --> 40:03.868
(both laugh)

40:06.170 --> 40:07.905
Can we not argue any more?

40:07.972 --> 40:10.508
I'm so happy that me and Marty's
had this chat.

40:10.574 --> 40:13.010
Cos I would hate to
leave here not friends.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.946
But I know, deep down,
I will always love that boy.

40:16.013 --> 40:17.615
Can we be friends?
Yes.

40:34.131 --> 40:35.132
Oh!

40:35.866 --> 40:38.402
Let's have a nice sit on the sofa,
all the pals.

40:39.203 --> 40:41.505
Fucking hell, it's that time again.

40:41.572 --> 40:44.909
We're all packed up and it's time
for wuh all to fucking bounce.

40:44.975 --> 40:47.545
We've done it again.
We've done it again.

40:47.611 --> 40:50.247
Shall we have a group cuddle?
Yeah! Yeah!

40:50.314 --> 40:51.382
I love cuddles!

40:51.448 --> 40:53.217
Haway, one last group hug.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.085
Come on.
Right.

40:55.152 --> 40:57.922
To the newbies.
(all) The newbies!

40:57.988 --> 41:00.424
The originals!
(all cheering)

41:01.358 --> 41:02.927
(cheering)

41:02.993 --> 41:06.397
You're going to need more workers.
What?!

41:06.463 --> 41:09.466
Oh, my God. This is exciting.

41:09.533 --> 41:13.237
We saw shit-loads of radgies
coming through that door.

41:15.272 --> 41:16.407
Oi, oi!

41:16.473 --> 41:18.542
I felt my fanny flutter.
Oi, oi!

41:18.609 --> 41:21.145
The ultimate radge test.

41:21.212 --> 41:23.314
It's more painful than anal.

41:23.914 --> 41:25.683
Ciao, ciao, Newcastle.

41:26.717 --> 41:27.852
(screams)

41:29.086 --> 41:30.454
It's been brutal.

41:34.325 --> 41:35.793
Oops.

41:39.964 --> 41:41.932
No.
I just want to go home.

41:46.470 --> 41:49.306
But we've had a bit of a frisk
along the way.

41:51.475 --> 41:54.245
Someone's just hoyed a nugget
off me face.

41:54.311 --> 41:56.881
Ow! My knee!

41:56.947 --> 41:59.984
That is the most beautiful arsehole
I've ever seen.

42:01.352 --> 42:04.922
One Marty finger stroking
Elettra's clitty clitty bang bang.

42:08.225 --> 42:12.096
We've all shared our love
for this fucked-up family.

42:12.162 --> 42:14.331
Get your rat out!

42:14.398 --> 42:16.834
I wanna kiss Chelsea's fanny.
Ooh!

42:20.204 --> 42:23.574
And now we've brought one more
radgie into our lives.

42:23.641 --> 42:24.975
Hello!

42:25.042 --> 42:26.210
I'm back.
(all cheer)

42:26.277 --> 42:28.045
For good.

42:30.881 --> 42:32.783
Welcome to the family!
(all cheer)

42:32.850 --> 42:34.485
Well, I've gotta go now.

42:34.551 --> 42:37.454
Abbie, well see you again.
See you next time.

42:37.521 --> 42:40.057
This experience
has been a roller coater.

42:40.124 --> 42:44.328
I'm so happy that I've made it to the
end and I'm now a part of the family.

42:46.764 --> 42:49.767
This time around,
it's been a journey.

42:49.833 --> 42:51.502
Me and Aaron are friends now.

42:51.568 --> 42:54.738
At one point, I didn't think
we could get back to this place.

42:54.805 --> 42:57.141
But it feels amazing,
I'm so happy about it.

42:57.207 --> 42:59.443
Do you want a lift?
Aye.

42:59.510 --> 43:03.447
Marty, I've got a baba seat
in the back. We'll see you.

43:03.514 --> 43:05.916
This time round,
it's been a proper frisk.

43:05.983 --> 43:07.718
Not only are me and Chloe mates,

43:07.785 --> 43:11.055
last night's threesome
made me top shagger!

43:11.121 --> 43:12.156
Thank you.

43:13.624 --> 43:17.027
(both) One, two, three. Aah!

43:17.094 --> 43:19.797
Enjoy the box.
(indistinct)

43:21.565 --> 43:23.167
(laughs)

43:23.600 --> 43:25.936
(sigh) Then there was two.

43:26.003 --> 43:29.740
I look around and it's actually
mental to think how crazy

43:29.807 --> 43:32.142
it's been this time.
See ya later, babe.

43:32.209 --> 43:34.745
I'm just so pleased
I've been here for the ride.

44:05.442 --> 44:05.642
.
