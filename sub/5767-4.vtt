00:02.600 --> 00:04.591
(rhythmic blipping)

00:09.810 --> 00:11.061
(beeps)

00:11.110 --> 00:13.738
(sighs)

00:20.850 --> 00:22.818
(door bells jingle)

00:22.850 --> 00:25.318
(newscast plays indistinctly)

00:25.350 --> 00:27.159
You got any toys?

00:36.330 --> 00:39.458
ROBBER:
Open... Don't fool with me, man!
Don't fool with me!

00:39.500 --> 00:41.263
You hear me? Open it up!
All right, all right!

00:41.300 --> 00:43.439
Get out the money!
Come on!
Man, it's jammed!

00:43.470 --> 00:46.177
Stop stalling, man!
Stop... Don't you fool with me!

00:46.210 --> 00:49.179
It's okay, I got it, I got it.
I got the safe right here, man!

00:49.210 --> 00:51.178
Don't you fool with me, man!
I'll blast your ass!

00:51.210 --> 00:52.848
Gimme...
Gimme the damn money!

00:52.880 --> 00:53.972
(gunshots)

00:57.850 --> 01:00.057
(newscast plays indistinctly)

01:01.760 --> 01:04.524
(cell phone ringing)

01:10.300 --> 01:12.063
(ringing continues)

01:13.840 --> 01:15.239
Shh.

01:15.270 --> 01:17.261
Shh.

01:18.340 --> 01:20.137
WOMAN (over phone):
Oh, my God.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.807
You were in a robbery?
Where are you?

01:21.840 --> 01:23.376
At a police station.

01:23.410 --> 01:25.571
I was the only one
who saw the robbery.

01:25.610 --> 01:27.168
I didn't want you to worry.

01:27.220 --> 01:29.688
Yeah, I'll call you back, hon.
Someone's here.

01:29.720 --> 01:31.449
Yeah, please call me back.

01:31.490 --> 01:33.287
Yes. Bye.
It's okay if you
want to finish your call.

01:33.320 --> 01:35.208
No, I did.
It's the wife, you know.

01:35.260 --> 01:36.625
Oh, yeah, I know.

01:36.660 --> 01:37.888
Hey, I'm Cary Agos

01:37.930 --> 01:38.885
with the State's
Attorney's office.

01:38.930 --> 01:41.125
I wanted to thank you
for helping us out here.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.297
No problem.

01:42.330 --> 01:44.423
Why don't we talk
in private?

01:44.470 --> 01:47.291
This _is kind of
a norsy room.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.739
So, we may need you around
for trial, Mr. Dolan.

01:48.770 --> 01:50.909
You, uh, found
a suspect?

01:50.940 --> 01:54.171
No, no, but if we do,
we'll need you around for trial.

01:54.210 --> 01:56.144
Were you planning on going
anywhere?

01:56.180 --> 01:58.171
Me? No. Why?

01:58.210 --> 02:00.212
Just you and your wife applied
for passports last week.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.717
Ah, right.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.786
Uh, Cabo.

02:03.820 --> 02:06.209
Pretty pricey?
No.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.455
No, it's, uh,
it's my in-laws.

02:08.490 --> 02:10.651
Oh, in-laws.

02:10.690 --> 02:14.694
So... you told the officer

02:14.730 --> 02:16.425
you didn't touch anything
in the store,

02:16.470 --> 02:19.189
and you were just looking
for a squirt gun for your son.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.162
It's his birthday today.

02:21.200 --> 02:21.894
Why?

02:21.940 --> 02:24.408
Well, it's just...

02:24.440 --> 02:26.476
the police,
they dusted for prints,

02:26.510 --> 02:29.172
and they found yours
on this display here.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.545
Ah, yes.

02:32.580 --> 02:34.445
When I entered the store, I, um,

02:34.480 --> 02:37.244
I was looking at
some of the greeting cards.

02:37.290 --> 02:38.643
So you did touch something.

02:38.690 --> 02:40.351
The display, yes. Why?

02:45.430 --> 02:48.627
So you wanted to buy
a greeting card, not a toy?

02:48.660 --> 02:51.220
No, 1-1 wanted to buy a toy.

02:51.270 --> 02:53.238
So why did you touch the cards?

02:55.270 --> 02:57.500
Is-is there something wrong?

02:57.540 --> 03:00.703
I don't think so.
Is there?

03:02.310 --> 03:03.504
I think I'd like to leave now.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.404
I'm afraid I can't
allow that, Mr. Dolan.

03:05.450 --> 03:07.338
Why?

03:09.420 --> 03:12.355
We're holding you
for investigation.

03:12.390 --> 03:15.359
(handcuffs clicking)

03:18.030 --> 03:20.419
(people chattering)

03:38.350 --> 03:40.978
Mr. Dolan,
I'm Alicia Florrick.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.341
Are you the public defender?

03:43.390 --> 03:46.314
No, I'm registered with the
City Bar's Pro Bono Program.

03:46.360 --> 03:47.281
They referred your case.

03:47.320 --> 03:49.686
But if you'd prefer
a public defender.
No.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.879
This is crazy.

03:50.930 --> 03:52.249
I know.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.598
I saw a robbery and
they think because

03:54.630 --> 03:56.518
my fingerprints
were on a display

03:56.570 --> 03:58.561
that was thrown down,
that I did it.

03:58.600 --> 04:00.295
Well, actually, Mr. Dolan,
the police have an eyewitness

04:00.340 --> 04:03.400
who saw you struggle
with the clerk and shoot him.

04:05.910 --> 04:07.639
That's not true. I don't...

04:07.680 --> 04:10.046
Okay, listen,
don't say a word to anyone.

04:10.080 --> 04:11.479
Okay?

04:11.510 --> 04:13.273
Will you call my wife?

04:13.320 --> 04:15.015
They took my cell.

04:15.050 --> 04:16.608
Actually, don't call her.

04:16.650 --> 04:18.311
I'll call her.
Okay.

04:18.350 --> 04:20.056
So are you following me now?

04:20.090 --> 04:21.955
Just going where
the pro bonos take me, Cary.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.855
I don't suppose you'd let
me question him more.

04:23.890 --> 04:25.926
I mean, he's innocent, right?

04:27.760 --> 04:29.057
CARY:
Thank you, Mr. Boylan.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.692
Are you ready?

04:30.730 --> 04:31.958
I guess I am.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.592
Okay, send the first one.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.562
You take all the time you want.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.429
Hello.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.334
Hi.

04:41.380 --> 04:43.348
May I help you?

04:43.380 --> 04:44.745
No, I'm good.

04:44.780 --> 04:47.419
DETECTIVE:_
There's gomg to be five total.

04:47.450 --> 04:49.918
All right, walk to the line.

04:49.950 --> 04:52.714
Turn to your left.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.479
Touch the wall.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.488
And turn back.

04:58.490 --> 05:00.355
No. Not him.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.391
DETECTIVE:
Send in number two.

05:02.430 --> 05:03.863
Walk to the line.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.334
Were you wearing those glasses
when you saw the murder?

05:06.370 --> 05:07.439
Yeah.

05:07.470 --> 05:08.664
Turn to your left.

05:09.610 --> 05:11.407
No, definitely not.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.998
He was much thinner than that.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.429
Okay, send in number three.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.846
(over intercom):
Number three, step forward.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.350
Stop on the line.

05:34.130 --> 05:36.325
Look in the lens.

05:37.470 --> 05:39.392
Don't move.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.397
That's him.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.438
Are you sure?

05:45.470 --> 05:47.404
That's the man you saw
struggling with the cashier,

05:47.440 --> 05:48.600
and firing two bullets

05:48.640 --> 05:50.403
into his head?
Yes.

05:50.450 --> 05:51.508
Definitely.

05:51.550 --> 05:54.075
DETECTIVE:
Head back in, number
three. Thank you.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.872
CARY:
Travis Dolan,

05:55.920 --> 05:57.979
an unemployed former
Parks employee.

05:58.020 --> 06:00.159
He's broke, about
to be evicted.

06:00.190 --> 06:02.420
He's Mr. Everyman,
except this Everyman

06:02.460 --> 06:04.553
walks into a convenience
store to rob It.

06:04.590 --> 06:06.592
Doesn't count on the cashier
haVIng a gun.

06:06.630 --> 06:08.723
Shoots him, kills him.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.796
Sees a passing patrol
car pulling up.

06:10.830 --> 06:12.934
Puts his gun down, hides
in the back of the store,

06:12.970 --> 06:14.130
pretending to be a witness.

06:14.170 --> 06:16.138
Prints on the gun?

06:16.170 --> 06:19.628
No usable prints,
but a solid eyewitness.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.705
No cash taken?

06:21.740 --> 06:22.741
Didn't have time.

06:22.780 --> 06:24.975
The patrol car
surprised him.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.147
There was a struggle, right?

06:26.180 --> 06:27.977
During the commission
of a robbery.

06:28.020 --> 06:29.419
You want second degree?

06:29.450 --> 06:31.088
(phone ringing)

06:31.120 --> 06:32.758
Offer second degree,
I'll take it to him.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.688
Once again, I look for my
liaison, but where is she?

06:40.730 --> 06:43.164
And once again, I have a job
that sometimes takes me,

06:43.200 --> 06:44.861
oddly, out of the office.

06:44.900 --> 06:47.460
So what, I handle this meeting
on my own, is that it?

06:47.500 --> 06:48.432
You do.
You're a big boy, Eli.

06:48.470 --> 06:51.007
And Will and Diane don't bite.

06:51.040 --> 06:52.166
Yeah, it's not them
I'm worried about.

06:52.210 --> 06:53.472
Okay, so here's my advice, Eli:

06:53.510 --> 06:55.876
don't bite them. Okay?

06:55.910 --> 06:57.878
Always the levelheaded one.

06:57.910 --> 07:00.413
Okay. I need you to work
with me full-time.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.579
Really?
Yes.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.178
I need investigator time.

07:05.220 --> 07:07.916
The law moves slow; I move fast.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.451
I'm managing three
campaign crises right now,

07:10.490 --> 07:13.459
and the cheese lobby has just
taken me on full-time.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.149
Yes, the cheese lobby.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.497
You're fast, you're a pro.

07:16.530 --> 07:17.667
I need you full-time.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.565
They won't let me be full-time.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.238
That's why I'm telling them.

07:21.270 --> 07:24.137
I don't like sharing.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.035
And between you and me,

07:26.070 --> 07:27.776
and whoever else you tell

07:27.810 --> 07:29.903
once I ask you,

07:29.950 --> 07:33.511
I need someone as investigator
when I leave here.

07:33.550 --> 07:36.041
For opposition research.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.583
That's not going
to happen.

07:38.620 --> 07:39.609
It is going to happen,

07:39.660 --> 07:41.480
because I'm going to make it
worth your while.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.556
More money, more power,
more self-reliance.

07:43.590 --> 07:44.852
DIANE:
Hello, Eli.
How are you?

07:44.890 --> 07:46.221
Great. Good.

07:46.260 --> 07:47.727
Will, how are you?

07:47.760 --> 07:49.489
I'm good, Eli.
Always a pleasure.

07:49.530 --> 07:51.828
Julius Cain, head of litigation.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.167
Nice to meet you.

07:53.200 --> 07:54.667
Um, so, I've hit
the ground running,

07:54.700 --> 07:56.190
as I'm sure you're well aware,

07:56.240 --> 07:58.708
and now I think it's time
to take a breath and reassess.

07:58.740 --> 08:00.037
No!

08:00.080 --> 08:03.504
Ten minutes!

08:03.550 --> 08:07.077
And I need both Alicia Florrick
and Kalinda--

08:07.120 --> 08:09.543
what's your last name again?--
Sharma.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.912
Sharma, dedicated
to my department full-time.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.986
Lobbying and crisis management
are a 24/7 business,

08:16.020 --> 08:19.285
and I need 24/7 dedication.

08:19.330 --> 08:21.150
No.

08:21.200 --> 08:23.521
Anything else?

08:24.800 --> 08:25.926
Am I making you money?

08:25.970 --> 08:27.130
You are.

08:27.170 --> 08:29.604
Am I encouraging clients to keep
political business in-house?

08:29.640 --> 08:31.608
You are.
Then I can't be splitting

08:31.640 --> 08:33.278
Alicia and Kalinda's time
with legal.

08:33.310 --> 08:35.278
Alicia is supposed to be
at this meeting-- where is she?

08:35.310 --> 08:36.846
She's on a case.

08:36.880 --> 08:38.245
A case that
makes us money.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.669
DIANE:
Why don't we
discuss this, Eli?

08:40.720 --> 08:43.245
We take your concerns
very seriously.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.315
WILL:
He'll stay because
it's in his interest to stay.

08:45.350 --> 08:47.181
DIAN_E:_
It's only In hIS Interest

08:47.220 --> 08:49.757
to stay if we encourage
cooperation.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.257
But he doesn't want
cooperation.

08:51.290 --> 08:52.279
Look at the numbers, Will.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.649
The dairy people
bnngin

08:53.700 --> 08:55.053
almost as much as we lost
last year.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.328
But at what cost?

08:56.360 --> 08:59.261
If we dedicate Alicia to Eli,
what are we pulling her from?

08:59.300 --> 09:01.336
How much money are we losing?

09:01.370 --> 09:03.930
Well, actually, at the moment,
Alicia is working on a pro bono.

09:04.970 --> 09:08.201
Okay, why are we still
doing pro bonos?

09:08.240 --> 09:10.049
Because we're still a member...

09:10.080 --> 09:11.843
And why am I the only one who's
worried about the economy?

09:11.880 --> 09:13.609
We are heading into
a double-dip recession

09:13.650 --> 09:16.346
without a bankruptcy department,
without tax lavwers,

09:16.380 --> 09:18.644
and our lawyers,
some of our best lawyers,

09:18.690 --> 09:20.112
are busy doing pro bono?

09:20.160 --> 09:21.684
ELI:
I need to talk to you.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.051
KALIN DA:
About?

09:23.090 --> 09:24.853
Things.

09:24.890 --> 09:26.323
The players.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.295
The political
crosscurrents.

09:29.330 --> 09:30.194
KALIN DA:
Really?

09:30.230 --> 09:32.596
You seem smart enough
to figure that out.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.596
I'm smart enough to know

09:34.640 --> 09:37.234
I need your help
figuring it out.

09:38.270 --> 09:39.669
We've expanded, Will,

09:39.710 --> 09:40.972
beyond our means.

09:41.010 --> 09:42.944
Yes, we're one of the few

09:42.980 --> 09:46.199
all-service firms left standing,
but we did it at a cost,

09:46.250 --> 09:47.615
and we can't continue this way.

09:47.650 --> 09:49.743
What way?
We need bankruptcy.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.644
If there's one department
that'll survive

09:51.690 --> 09:54.250
a double-dip recession,
it's bankruptcy.

09:54.290 --> 09:57.851
To build one from the ground up
would take time,

09:57.890 --> 10:00.358
but luckily enough,
we can acquire one

10:00.400 --> 10:02.152
off the shelf.
How?

10:02.200 --> 10:03.861
There's a firm breaking up:

10:03.900 --> 10:06.835
malpractice is going one way,

10:06.870 --> 10:08.633
acquisition another,
bankruptcy,

10:08.670 --> 10:11.264
I just found out,
is going with litigation.
Oh, no.

10:11.310 --> 10:13.130
Yes. You need to talk to her.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.034
We already said no.
We already said no

10:15.080 --> 10:16.741
when we thought
it was just litigation.

10:16.780 --> 10:17.906
If it's litigation
and bankruptcy...

10:17.950 --> 10:19.713
Then you talk to her.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.377
No. Everybody's going
to be wing

10:21.420 --> 10:22.682
for her bankruptcy department.

10:22.720 --> 10:23.414
We need someone who has

10:23.450 --> 10:25.680
a preexisting
relationship.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.278
I don't even know
where she IS.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.413
The Midwest Bar Association.

10:29.460 --> 10:33.191
_ Celeste Serra_no
IS dorng a seminar

10:33.230 --> 10:35.790
in Dispute Resolution.

10:38.230 --> 10:40.733
Get us bankruptcy,

10:40.770 --> 10:44.729
and we won't have to dance
to the tune of Eli Gold.

10:44.770 --> 10:48.069
Have you noticed,
no matter how high we go,

10:48.110 --> 10:50.670
we're still dancing
to someone's tune?

10:50.710 --> 10:52.814
Welcome to leadership.

11:08.430 --> 11:11.160
I don't want to see any lawyers
pushing off their CLE hours.

11:11.200 --> 11:15.068
Guess who's in town?
The Midwest Bar Association.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.068
(all grumbling)
That's right.
That's right.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.135
Just get it over with.

11:19.170 --> 11:22.139
I have one more item
I want to talk about.

11:22.180 --> 11:26.173
The Department of Justice has
identified certain--

11:26.210 --> 11:28.713
and I'll use their word--

11:28.750 --> 11:31.310
"biases" in how we plea bargain.

11:31.350 --> 11:34.114
So I've agreed to the
government's request

11:34.160 --> 11:36.822
to detail an AUSA
to this office.

11:36.860 --> 11:38.987
Not to monitor us,
but to work with us,

11:39.030 --> 11:40.793
and be as one of us.

11:40.830 --> 11:43.765
So please welcome
Imani Stonehouse. Imani.

11:43.800 --> 11:46.394
Hello.

11:46.430 --> 11:47.499
You're all under arrest.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.963
(laughter)

11:50.010 --> 11:51.432
PETER:
Okay, let's get going.

11:51.470 --> 11:55.804
Imani, I'd like you
to meet Cary Agos.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.444
He'll be showing you
the ropes.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.505
He already has.

11:59.550 --> 12:02.781
Maximum sentence
to a black drug dealer.

12:02.820 --> 12:03.912
Discount to
a white killer.

12:03.950 --> 12:05.087
Okay.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.850
We're off to a great start.

12:07.890 --> 12:11.121
The white defendant--
he had no priors.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.458
And no crack.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.388
Oh, yeah.
Yep, you got me there.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.967
Big bad white prosecutor out to
put down the black man.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.865
And black woman.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.198
WOMAN (over P.A.): "Ethics in
Law" will begin in ten minutes

12:24.240 --> 12:26.231
in conference room A.

12:27.540 --> 12:29.371
Please don't forget to sign in.

12:29.410 --> 12:31.241
And remember to pick up
your name cards.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.474
Will Gardner.

12:32.510 --> 12:34.842
What the hell
are you doing here?

12:34.880 --> 12:38.338
Hey, I've got 30 hours of CLE
like everyone else.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.539
Well, come on up
to the 34th floor

12:39.590 --> 12:41.478
if you want to continue
that legal education.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.851
Strippers and Acquisitions.

12:44.890 --> 12:45.925
Maybe later.

12:49.970 --> 12:59.208
OSTERMAN: So, um... based on
this, um, I believe, um... um...

12:59.240 --> 13:01.834
It's notjust, uh...

13:01.880 --> 13:04.041
Should have known
you'd be here.

13:06.550 --> 13:08.279
He's amazing, isn't he?

13:08.320 --> 13:10.982
The criminal mind...

13:11.020 --> 13:12.908
Yeah.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.279
You always hated him.

13:14.320 --> 13:18.552
Nope. Just thought
he was a bad boss.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.194
You were jealous.

13:20.230 --> 13:22.357
Of...?

13:25.000 --> 13:27.264
You did not.

13:27.300 --> 13:29.860
After the staff meeting
on 9/11.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.866
Remember?
He was In tears.

13:31.910 --> 13:33.332
You slept with him?

13:33.380 --> 13:34.972
We didn't do
much sleeping.

13:35.010 --> 13:37.774
Oh, oh, okay,
you can stop now.

13:41.650 --> 13:43.948
You found_ out it wasn't
only litigation.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.379
The bankruptcy
is coming with me.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.958
So you here to charm me?

13:50.990 --> 13:53.629
To offer you a home.

13:53.660 --> 13:57.061
And what about your lawyer
friend Alicia Florrick?

13:57.100 --> 13:59.523
Why isn't she here
to charm me, too?

13:59.570 --> 14:01.367
(applause)

14:06.110 --> 14:07.907
What are you looking for?

14:07.940 --> 14:09.908
To come to
Lockhart/Gardner?

14:09.950 --> 14:12.145
A three-year commitment
to litigation.

14:12.180 --> 14:13.340
Oh, come on.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.268
And a five percent
bump in salary

14:15.320 --> 14:17.447
and a 50/50 split on
the Hammett Aerospace.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.958
The jetliner crash? No.

14:19.990 --> 14:20.558
Mr. Osterman.

14:20.590 --> 14:21.909
Remember me?

14:21.960 --> 14:23.086
Celeste.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.586
Oh, yes. How are you?

14:24.630 --> 14:26.951
In Baltimore?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.150
Oh, my goodness, yes.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.065
Excuse me.

14:32.570 --> 14:34.197
A three-year commitment
to litigation,

14:34.240 --> 14:37.869
a five percent bump in salary
and we'll call it a day.

14:39.240 --> 14:40.468
We have other suitors.

14:40.510 --> 14:41.932
I'll talk to Diane.

14:41.980 --> 14:43.607
DIANE:
Until the economy improves,

14:43.650 --> 14:46.915
we're calling a halt
to pro bonos.

14:46.950 --> 14:48.019
Plead out the ones
you've got,

14:48.050 --> 14:50.439
then we need everyone full-time,
back in the office.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.378
Cary's resisting a plea.

14:52.420 --> 14:53.489
What's on the table?

14:53.520 --> 14:54.987
Second degree.
20 years.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.214
For a murder with
an eyeWItness?

14:56.260 --> 14:57.249
Sounds like a worthy offer.

14:57.290 --> 14:58.257
The client's resisting.

14:58.290 --> 15:00.690
Okay, I'll help
out there.

15:00.730 --> 15:01.992
You want me
to talk to Legal Aid?

15:02.030 --> 15:02.849
No, I'll do it.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.561
I at least owe_them
an explanation.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.395
Yeah. Will.
Where are we?

15:10.040 --> 15:12.235
She wants 50% on her jetliner
class action.

15:12.270 --> 15:14.977
She has the crew,
we've got the passengers.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.079
35%. Maybe.

15:16.110 --> 15:18.305
Okay, tell Celeste 35%.

15:19.980 --> 15:22.312
The way you usually do--
your charm.

15:22.350 --> 15:23.339
(chuckling)

15:23.390 --> 15:25.642
I believe in you.

15:25.690 --> 15:26.987
Bye.

15:27.020 --> 15:28.510
She's playing hard to get.

15:56.480 --> 15:57.742
Mr. Dolan, how are you?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.644
I'm okay, thank you.

15:59.690 --> 16:02.113
Ijust, uh...

16:07.360 --> 16:08.349
I'm so sorry.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.391
No.

16:10.430 --> 16:11.658
We love you.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.133
Can I, uh...

16:13.170 --> 16:15.991
No, not yet.
No contact.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.065
Jakie, this all just
a big mistake, all right?

16:18.110 --> 16:20.271
I'll be home soon and we'll
celebrate your birthday,

16:20.310 --> 16:21.299
all right, kiddo?

16:22.640 --> 16:24.471
Daddy loves you very much.

16:29.680 --> 16:31.113
(stifled sob)

16:31.150 --> 16:32.219
JULIUS:
Come on.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.410
No record.

16:33.460 --> 16:34.449
Not even a
parking ticket.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.117
That's why I offered
second degree.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.457
Shav_e off another
five years.

16:37.490 --> 16:40.197
You haven't met my workmate,
have you?

16:40.230 --> 16:42.027
Imani...
Imani Stonehouse.

16:42.060 --> 16:43.095
She's an AUSA to make sure

16:43.130 --> 16:47.089
there's no racial imbalance
in plea bargaining.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.437
So _that's what's
gomg on here?

16:48.470 --> 16:51.667
You're hard bargaining for,
what, appearances?

16:51.710 --> 16:54.099
I don't think it's just
appearance, do you?

16:54.140 --> 16:56.131
I think it's another state's
attorney preoccupation.

16:56.180 --> 16:58.148
Forgotten in a month.

17:01.420 --> 17:03.217
I think he liked you.

17:03.250 --> 17:04.547
What's the plan?

17:04.590 --> 17:05.648
Turn the
preliminary hearing

17:05.690 --> 17:07.112
into a poor man's
deposition,

17:07.160 --> 17:08.582
get the prosecution
to show their hand?

17:08.620 --> 17:10.326
Judge isn't going
to let that happen.

17:10.360 --> 17:11.520
BAILIFF:
All rise!

17:11.560 --> 17:13.357
The Honorable
Francis Flamm presiding.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.799
FLAMM:
No, no.

17:14.830 --> 17:16.559
Everybody sit down, please.

17:18.130 --> 17:20.269
Justice Tie-Dye?
Mm-hmm.

17:20.300 --> 17:24.202
Evelyn made a great zucchini
bread, if anybody wants.

17:24.240 --> 17:25.434
Hmm?

17:25.470 --> 17:26.539
Evelyn, quiet,

17:26.570 --> 17:28.128
hand it around.

17:28.180 --> 17:28.908
Come on.

17:28.940 --> 17:30.805
DIANE:
Uh, offer her flex time.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.704
The option to telecommute.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.718
Tell her we'll find her
a corner office.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.115
We're out of corners.

17:36.150 --> 17:38.618
Where are you, football game?

17:38.650 --> 17:39.639
Uh, yes, my midday treat
to myself.

17:39.690 --> 17:40.782
No. Legal Aid.

17:40.820 --> 17:44.221
Come on, Diane, you don't have
to break up in person.

17:44.260 --> 17:45.124
Just make a call.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.184
Uh, Mr. Coyne, please.

17:46.230 --> 17:48.653
Tell him it's Diane Lockhart.

17:48.700 --> 17:49.849
Yeah, well, that was the plan,

17:49.900 --> 17:52.289
but my guilt
was getting to me.

17:52.330 --> 17:53.638
Guilt is for the weak.

17:53.670 --> 17:54.568
(chuckling)

17:54.600 --> 17:57.205
Go-- sweeten our offer.

17:57.240 --> 17:58.662
The cashier pulled this gun
from a holster

17:58.710 --> 17:59.734
he had under the counter.

17:59.770 --> 18:01.601
Then they just started firing.

18:01.640 --> 18:04.746
And you were standing 20 feet
from the window.

18:04.780 --> 18:06.702
And how far was the shooter
inside the store?

18:06.750 --> 18:08.479
Your Honor, again, objection.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.181
This is a preliminary hearing.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.586
The defense is using this as
a poor man's deposition,

18:12.620 --> 18:14.156
to get a preview
of our case.

18:14.190 --> 18:14.952
Yep.

18:14.990 --> 18:16.389
Heard it the first time,
Counselor.

18:16.420 --> 18:18.149
Got it.

18:18.190 --> 18:19.327
Overruled.

18:19.360 --> 18:22.249
ALICIA: And how far was the
shooter inside the store?

18:22.300 --> 18:23.494
He's killing us.

18:23.530 --> 18:25.191
Get used to it.

18:25.230 --> 18:26.322
Ten feet, probably?

18:26.370 --> 18:30.431
So, 30 feet in total?

18:30.470 --> 18:33.337
20 feet to the window,
ten feet inside.

18:33.380 --> 18:36.304
Was he on the sidewalk
or in the parking lot?

18:38.850 --> 18:40.477
And so I'm curious, Mr. Boylan,

18:40.520 --> 18:42.715
were you on
the sidewalk

18:42.750 --> 18:45.412
in front of the store,
or in the parking lot?

18:45.450 --> 18:46.417
On the sidewalk.

18:46.450 --> 18:47.485
On the sidewalk.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.421
Yep, I can see into the store.

18:50.460 --> 18:51.654
There's no reflection problem.

18:51.690 --> 18:53.351
Where did he say
the shooter went?

18:53.400 --> 18:56.858
Where did this person go
after you saw him shoot?

18:56.900 --> 18:58.367
Back into the store to hide.

18:58.400 --> 18:59.424
So you saw him hide?

18:59.470 --> 19:02.234
No, I'm just...

19:02.270 --> 19:04.409
he went toward
the rear of the store.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.429
So maybe
the real robber

19:05.470 --> 19:06.562
went out the back door.

19:06.610 --> 19:08.168
CARY:
Objection!

19:08.210 --> 19:10.405
It's one exit.
Punch-key lock.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.678
You need to know the code
to get out.

19:11.710 --> 19:12.472
Damn.

19:12.510 --> 19:14.740
ALICIA:
Detective, have you heard of

19:14.780 --> 19:16.372
cross-racial identification?
I have.

19:16.420 --> 19:17.239
But you don't give it much
credence.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.383
Well, do I think
that some whites tend to

19:19.420 --> 19:21.456
misidentify black suspects

19:21.490 --> 19:22.752
because they have trouble

19:22.790 --> 19:26.282
distinguishing
features-- yes.

19:26.330 --> 19:29.527
But the eyewitness here was
black and the accused white.

19:29.560 --> 19:33.929
And have you seen studies that
blacks often misidentify whites?

19:33.970 --> 19:35.858
I haven't, but I'll
take your word for it.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.504
Didn't Mr. Boylan give a more

19:37.540 --> 19:39.462
general description
of a white suspect,

19:39.510 --> 19:42.479
before he saw my client at
your desk, being questioned?

19:42.510 --> 19:44.444
Are you talking about
the artist's sketch?

19:46.610 --> 19:48.646
I wasn't.

19:48.680 --> 19:49.817
But sure.

19:49.850 --> 19:52.546
(laughs, snorts)

19:52.590 --> 19:56.310
Uh... continue, please.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.578
And this_ artist sketch was done
prior to Mr. Boylan's

19:58.630 --> 20:00.325
seeing my client
in the police station?

20:00.360 --> 20:03.420
Yes, but I wouldn't call
the description "general."

20:03.470 --> 20:05.529
Isn't it possible that
Mr. Boylan only fixated

20:05.570 --> 20:07.390
on my client as the shooter,

20:07.440 --> 20:10.261
because he saw him being
questioned by police?

20:10.310 --> 20:14.007
And couldn't this sketch direct
you to the real killer?

20:14.040 --> 20:15.268
No.
We have the real killer.

20:15.310 --> 20:16.470
Your Honor,

20:16.510 --> 20:19.741
defense asks for access
to this sketch.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.418
Seems like
a reasonable request.

20:21.450 --> 20:23.486
Counselor?

20:23.520 --> 20:26.648
Any trouble getting it to them?

20:26.690 --> 20:28.510
MAN: Any more questions?
I got to get back to work.

20:28.560 --> 20:32.280
Uh, yeah, so you were here
yesterday during the shooting.

20:32.330 --> 20:33.297
Yes.

20:33.330 --> 20:34.024
It was crazy.

20:34.060 --> 20:35.459
The cops got here
really fast.

20:35.500 --> 20:36.990
People running around,
screaming...

20:37.030 --> 20:38.691
And did you see anyone
who looked like this,

20:38.730 --> 20:40.368
running around, screaming?

20:40.400 --> 20:41.037
I thought they caught
the guy who did it.

20:41.070 --> 20:42.469
No.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.400
I don't know.

20:44.440 --> 20:45.930
This looks like
a hundred people.

20:45.970 --> 20:46.937
Do you mind?

20:46.970 --> 20:48.506
Sure.

20:53.380 --> 20:55.519
Yeah. Try and get
the crime scene photos.

20:55.550 --> 20:57.313
Cops aren't giving me access.

20:57.350 --> 20:58.886
We also would suggest,
Your Honor,

20:58.920 --> 21:00.512
that it would be
helpful to have access

21:00.560 --> 21:01.913
to the crime scene photos.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.053
They do have access, Your Honor,
in discovery.

21:04.090 --> 21:06.422
Which we always get
at the last minute.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.394
Because we have to prepare them,
so it takes time.

21:08.430 --> 21:09.590
Well, who prepares it,
Counselor?

21:12.830 --> 21:13.831
Give me their number.

21:13.870 --> 21:15.690
Maybe they can expedite it.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.663
Hey, Tim, listen--

21:52.710 --> 21:54.769
can you find out who bought
a lottery ticket

21:54.810 --> 21:56.471
from its bar code?

21:59.480 --> 22:01.710
You do know you're in
the criminal law mixer?

22:01.750 --> 22:03.615
I like criminal.

22:03.650 --> 22:06.414
The men are so... straight.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.509
So we're fine with a
three percent bump

22:08.560 --> 22:10.380
and a two-year commitment
to your litigators.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.751
Do you know what it means
to feed the rat, Will?

22:14.400 --> 22:15.856
Do I...? No.

22:15.900 --> 22:17.527
You can live
your sweet

22:17.570 --> 22:19.094
little domesticated life.

22:19.130 --> 22:22.497
You can date your cute little
apple-cheeked lawyer.

22:22.540 --> 22:23.438
(chuckling):
Apple-cheeked?

22:23.470 --> 22:25.700
But eventually,
you have to feed the rat.

22:25.740 --> 22:26.934
Return to the wild.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.403
Oh, that's fascinating.

22:28.440 --> 22:29.577
We're not going
above three percent.

22:29.610 --> 22:31.840
You need to feed
the rat, Will.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.677
You are killing yourself

22:33.720 --> 22:35.517
trying to be normal.
I am normal.

22:35.550 --> 22:36.915
Mr. Florrick, hi.

22:36.950 --> 22:38.440
Big fan.

22:38.490 --> 22:39.388
PETER:
Hello.

22:39.420 --> 22:41.513
CELESTE:
I came here
especially hoping

22:41.560 --> 22:42.686
to bump into you.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.722
I think you know
Will Gardner.

22:44.760 --> 22:46.455
Yes, I do. Hi, Will.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.593
Peter.

22:47.630 --> 22:49.427
You two
have so much

22:49.460 --> 22:51.462
in common,
don't you?

22:59.440 --> 23:00.976
We do have a lot in common.

23:01.010 --> 23:02.739
And how do you two
know each other?

23:02.780 --> 23:04.042
Us? We...

23:04.080 --> 23:06.878
Worked at the same firm
together long time ago.

23:06.910 --> 23:09.117
We did a lot
more than that.

23:09.150 --> 23:11.482
The Baltimore firm:
Osterman, Lee, Canfield.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.454
It was my first job
out of college.

23:13.490 --> 23:15.481
My first threesome
was with Will.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.987
(chuckles)

23:17.020 --> 23:18.658
That's true.
(clears throat)

23:18.690 --> 23:20.954
What was her name again?
Celeste, okay.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.524
Well, you have to start
somewhere.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.425
(laughing)

23:24.470 --> 23:26.563
So Alicia Florrick, huh?

23:26.600 --> 23:29.467
Well, she works with Will,
she's married to you.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.401
Must be quite an arrangement.
Discuss.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.644
It is quite an
arrangement. Yes.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.205
Any awloNard moments?

23:40.250 --> 23:41.547
You mean besides this one?

23:41.580 --> 23:43.548
(laughs)

23:43.590 --> 23:46.047
How many kids
do you have, Peter?

23:46.090 --> 23:47.819
Two. Boy and a girl.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.657
I love boys and girls.

23:49.690 --> 23:51.226
That's very domestic.

23:51.260 --> 23:52.522
What ages?

23:52.560 --> 23:53.629
16 and 14.

23:53.660 --> 23:55.059
Oh, that's
a very good age.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.829
Isn't that a very
good age, Will?

23:56.860 --> 23:59.465
Me, I don't
get kids.

23:59.500 --> 24:02.230
I mean, I get why
they're important, but...

24:02.270 --> 24:03.532
You get them if you got them.

24:03.570 --> 24:04.662
Really? I don't know.

24:04.710 --> 24:05.836
I'm too selfish.

24:07.140 --> 24:09.870
Have you ever
met his kids?

24:11.210 --> 24:12.848
No, I haven't.

24:12.880 --> 24:13.642
Really?

24:13.680 --> 24:15.147
Alicia never brought them
to work?

24:15.180 --> 24:17.114
I think I'll head out.

24:17.150 --> 24:18.640
It's good to see you, Peter.

24:18.690 --> 24:20.817
Yeah.

24:22.820 --> 24:25.789
Who did you say
you were with again?

24:25.830 --> 24:27.525
The Lottery Control Board.

24:27.560 --> 24:30.620
A lottery ticket was paid out
yesterday for five dollars.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.661
It should have been $500.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.099
Well, that's my receipt
all right.

24:34.140 --> 24:37.029
But I bought it
as a gift for my son.

24:37.070 --> 24:39.038
Oh. Where's your son?
Oh, he moved

24:39.070 --> 24:41.607
back here-- home--
few months ago.

24:41.640 --> 24:42.937
Lovely.

24:42.980 --> 24:46.177
Uh, Mrs. Silvestre,
may I use your bathroom?

25:15.580 --> 25:16.831
MRS. SILVESTRE:
Oh, hi, dear.

25:16.880 --> 25:19.599
Did you have
a nice day?

25:19.650 --> 25:21.311
There's a young lady
here for you.

25:21.350 --> 25:22.612
VVho?

25:22.650 --> 25:24.242
She's from the
Lottery Control Board.

25:24.290 --> 25:26.246
Where is she?

25:26.290 --> 25:28.258
Hello?

25:28.290 --> 25:30.281
Hello?

25:34.860 --> 25:36.725
ELI:
I feel like you're
cheating on me.

25:36.760 --> 25:37.727
Only for money.

25:37.770 --> 25:38.998
You think that
makes it better?

25:40.770 --> 25:44.262
Between Will and Diane,
who holds more power?

25:44.310 --> 25:46.005
It's equal.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.600
It's never equal.

25:49.640 --> 25:50.971
Yeah.

25:51.010 --> 25:52.671
Diane_has _more
power in criminal,

25:52.710 --> 25:54.610
and Will in civil.

25:54.650 --> 25:56.777
But Diane controls
the purse strings.

25:56.820 --> 25:57.980
Only by default.

25:58.020 --> 25:59.942
Will hates dealing with it.

25:59.990 --> 26:03.050
But if Will says no,
is it real?

26:03.090 --> 26:04.819
Often.

26:04.860 --> 26:06.680
You're not
helping much.

26:06.730 --> 26:08.823
Darn.

26:08.860 --> 26:11.363
And this Julius guy--
what about him?

26:11.400 --> 26:13.732
Oh, he's head of litigation.

26:13.770 --> 26:15.635
He doesn't like me.

26:15.670 --> 26:17.228
Why doesn't he like me?

26:17.270 --> 26:19.738
You're the new
and shiny thing.

26:19.770 --> 26:21.909
Does it matter
that he doesn't like me?

26:21.940 --> 26:23.874
No.

26:23.910 --> 26:26.242
Anybody else with power?

26:26.280 --> 26:28.077
David Lee, family law.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.644
(scoffs)

26:29.680 --> 26:32.240
And Alicia-- where does she
stand in all of this?

26:34.690 --> 26:36.715
Yes?

26:36.760 --> 26:39.649
She's only a
third-year associate,

26:39.690 --> 26:42.022
but she matters.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.823
Because
of her husband?

26:43.870 --> 26:45.622
Various reasons.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.661
She can persuade people.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.930
People, as in Will?

26:49.970 --> 26:51.369
What are you
looking for, Eli?

26:51.410 --> 26:53.059
The hierarchy.

26:53.110 --> 26:54.839
Usually,
I can figure it out,

26:54.880 --> 26:57.769
but this place is like
a mom-and-pop store.

26:57.810 --> 26:59.402
It's all Will
and Diane.

26:59.450 --> 27:01.270
If you want to
persuade Diane,

27:01.320 --> 27:02.844
you persuade
David Lee.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.416
If you want to
persuade Will,

27:04.450 --> 27:06.315
you persuade Alicia.

27:06.350 --> 27:09.808
And here comes
your next customer.

27:11.460 --> 27:13.280
Okay. Where are we?

27:13.330 --> 27:16.219
Uh, according to
the time-coded

27:16.260 --> 27:18.296
register
receipt here,

27:18.330 --> 27:19.820
this lottery ticket
was redeemed

27:19.870 --> 27:21.235
seconds before
the murder.

27:21.270 --> 27:23.397
Whose ticket?
Mitch Silvestre.

27:23.440 --> 27:26.034
He's a manager from
a fish market across the way.

27:26.070 --> 27:27.105
As you can see,

27:27.140 --> 27:29.028
there is a slight
resemblance

27:29.080 --> 27:31.071
between him
and the artist sketch.

27:31.110 --> 27:32.805
Can you get more
on Silvestre?

27:32.850 --> 27:34.670
I'm on him.
(cell phone ringing)

27:34.720 --> 27:37.280
Good. We need
to delay in court.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.117
What are you doing?

27:39.150 --> 27:41.050
I'm working on a pro bono.
What are you doing?

27:41.090 --> 27:43.115
I don't know.
Whoring myself out.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.184
Sort of miss you.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.424
I sort of miss you, too.

27:45.460 --> 27:46.950
Well, what can we do about that?

27:46.990 --> 27:49.788
I don't know.
What do you want to do?

27:49.830 --> 27:50.819
Hey, let me call you back.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.292
I'll be here.

27:52.330 --> 27:54.662
Okay. Love you.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.767
I said that...

27:58.810 --> 28:00.698
I know.
No, automatically.

28:00.740 --> 28:02.298
Mechanically.
I didn't mean anything.

28:02.340 --> 28:03.477
Will, don't worry about it.

28:03.510 --> 28:05.705
I... it's not that I don't care.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.014
Will, call me later.

28:09.050 --> 28:11.041
Right. Good-bye.

28:18.060 --> 28:19.857
I'm sorry, okay?

28:19.890 --> 28:21.255
Don't pout.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.756
I'm fine.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.165
But you're not
accepting my apology.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.269
What do I
got to do?

28:25.300 --> 28:26.494
Bring us bankruptcy.

28:26.530 --> 28:29.738
Okay, I'll come clean.

28:29.770 --> 28:32.466
You're not chasing me, Will;
I'm chasing you.

28:32.510 --> 28:33.829
You're chasing me?
Yes.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.029
How you doing that?

28:35.080 --> 28:37.298
Litigation and bankruptcy
are, in fact, leaving the firm.

28:37.340 --> 28:38.841
That is true.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.177
So is tax

28:40.210 --> 28:41.313
and family law.

28:41.350 --> 28:42.374
And we're all
regrouping.

28:42.420 --> 28:43.910
As what, a jazz combo?

28:43.950 --> 28:45.212
No, as a new firm.

28:45.250 --> 28:46.239
And we want you.

28:46.290 --> 28:47.484
Celeste,
I know you're a dreamer,

28:47.520 --> 28:49.750
and I know you like
to live in your head,

28:49.790 --> 28:50.984
but what in your wildest dreams

28:51.030 --> 28:52.850
would make you think
I would leave my firm,

28:52.890 --> 28:54.858
one of the most
prestigious in Chicago,

28:54.900 --> 28:57.323
to come work for what
is ba5ically a start-up?

28:57.360 --> 29:00.488
'Cause I have the one thing
I know you want.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.191
What?

29:02.240 --> 29:03.389
Can't even guess?

29:03.440 --> 29:05.169
I can't even
begin to guess.

29:05.210 --> 29:07.405
I'm happy where I am.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.839
Baseball commissioner.

29:12.180 --> 29:14.819
It's the one thing
George W. Bush wanted

29:14.850 --> 29:16.772
more than the presidency.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.811
Don't play games with me.

29:18.850 --> 29:20.181
I'm not.

29:20.220 --> 29:21.312
The league's our
biggest client.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.453
Commissioner is getting on
in years.

29:23.490 --> 29:25.287
He HEEdS a SUCCESSOI‘.

29:25.330 --> 29:27.821
The successor's going to come
from our firm.

29:27.860 --> 29:29.327
You know baseball.

29:29.360 --> 29:30.793
You know the law.

29:30.830 --> 29:32.127
I don't believe you.

29:32.170 --> 29:33.319
Call some
friends, Will.

29:33.370 --> 29:34.337
You know who
to call.

29:34.370 --> 29:35.860
Look at me.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.333
I'm not making this up.

29:37.370 --> 29:40.976
When I go all in, it's not
with a stone-cold bluff.

29:47.250 --> 29:50.219
I got my dispute resolution
seminar in ten minutes.

29:50.250 --> 29:54.050
If you want to discuss how
this will work, stop by.

30:03.030 --> 30:04.998
Not Judge Powers, Judge Romano!
And tell her the brief

30:05.030 --> 30:06.292
is on its way.
All right, got it!

30:06.330 --> 30:07.399
Sorry about that.
Been in court all day.

30:07.430 --> 30:08.465
No problem,
Mr. Coyne.

30:08.500 --> 30:11.367
Maggie, hold all calls,
give me about five minutes.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.264
You were a litigator at Portman
& Michaels.

30:13.310 --> 30:17.235
Partner track. Dropped out.
Couldn't stand all the meetings.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.645
Next door down, man.
Thanks.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.841
Thank you for picking up the
slack on the convenience
store shooting.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.416
I hear you have two
lawyers on the case?

30:22.450 --> 30:24.145
I... Really?

30:24.190 --> 30:25.589
It's good to see,
considering

30:25.620 --> 30:27.349
all the firms that are
pulling back these days.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.017
Uh...
The Hanley deposition's
over there.

30:29.060 --> 30:31.278
Yes, well, actually...

30:31.330 --> 30:34.527
I need to talk to you
about this, uh...

30:34.560 --> 30:36.528
Guys, it's a go on
the Packer appeal.

30:36.560 --> 30:40.326
See if you can pull up
some U of C intern time.

30:40.370 --> 30:45.501
Ties? Gentlemen, you go to
court, you wear a tie.

30:45.540 --> 30:47.064
I'm sorry about that.

30:47.110 --> 30:50.238
I'm sorry. Uh...

30:50.280 --> 30:53.374
I know this, uh...
might not be a great time

30:53.410 --> 30:57.369
for this but we have to, um...
(clears throat)

30:57.420 --> 31:01.083
Our firm is bowing out of our
pro bono obligations.

31:01.120 --> 31:05.227
Just till things pick up.
You know, the economy.

31:05.260 --> 31:07.922
I get it. Don't worry about it.

31:07.960 --> 31:09.928
Thank you for fighting
for us, anyway.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.463
Well, I mean we hope to return
when things improve.

31:12.500 --> 31:15.298
It's okay. We're not sure we'll
be here. We lost our funding.

31:17.340 --> 31:19.331
Yeah. Budget crunch.

31:19.370 --> 31:21.270
So, what are you gonna do?
I don't know.

31:21.310 --> 31:23.130
You know, we still have a few
options, so...

31:23.180 --> 31:25.603
Such as?
Such as knocking
on a few doors.

31:25.650 --> 31:27.447
Yelling at a few rich people.

31:27.480 --> 31:30.210
One thing I've learned in the
not-for-profit world is that

31:30.250 --> 31:31.945
eventually, someone steps up.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.214
Well, I-I should go.

31:37.260 --> 31:40.229
Yes, thanks.

31:40.260 --> 31:42.353
You know, it's good to
finally meet you in person.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.698
And you.

31:44.730 --> 31:47.597
Iwish, uh...

31:47.630 --> 31:49.598
I don't know what I wish.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.528
The world were different.

31:51.570 --> 31:55.233
That sounds good!
I'll be here waiting.

31:57.210 --> 32:00.441
(hip-hop playing)

32:04.720 --> 32:07.518
Will Gardner, what the hell
took you so long?

32:07.550 --> 32:09.415
Hey.
Come on in.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.280
You don't want to miss
the Q and A.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.218
(men whooping)

32:13.260 --> 32:14.397
No, thanks.

32:14.430 --> 32:16.955
I'm looking for, um,
dispute resolution,

32:17.000 --> 32:18.365
neutrality something or other.

32:18.400 --> 32:20.391
Next door
on the right.

32:26.510 --> 32:28.398
Hey. Look who's here.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.533
Saved you a seat.

32:59.210 --> 33:01.201
Do you need help?

33:10.580 --> 33:13.378
(cell phone ringing)

33:13.420 --> 33:15.456
Yeah?

33:15.490 --> 33:16.650
I'm on him now.

33:30.470 --> 33:31.801
Alcoholics Anonymous?

33:31.840 --> 33:33.501
Yeah. Mitch goes to meetings
twice a week.

33:33.540 --> 33:35.531
What about the cash
in the envelope?

33:35.580 --> 33:36.808
Legit. He was
chapter treasurer.

33:36.840 --> 33:40.048
He likes to bet at the track,
but it was all of his own money.

33:40.080 --> 33:41.411
Still doesn't mean
he wasn't the killer.

33:41.450 --> 33:43.145
Yeah, but this does.

33:43.180 --> 33:45.045
I checked the register
at the convenience store.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.648
It's an hour fast.

33:46.690 --> 33:48.214
It could be
an aCCIdent,

33:48.260 --> 33:50.251
or it was monkeyed with
to run a lottery scam.

33:50.290 --> 33:52.485
It still puts him at the store
an hour before the murder.

33:54.460 --> 33:56.428
We can still tell a story.

33:56.460 --> 33:58.428
The guy worked
a few doors down.

33:58.470 --> 33:59.323
He knew the code

33:59.370 --> 34:00.462
to the locks.

34:00.500 --> 34:01.728
A 30-year-old
who likes to gamble.

34:01.770 --> 34:04.159
Whose financial situation
is bad enough

34:04.210 --> 34:05.632
it forces him to move home.

34:05.670 --> 34:08.639
Uh, I appreciate that we're
trying to find a fall guy,

34:08.680 --> 34:10.739
but putting this
on an innocent man?

34:10.780 --> 34:12.645
Isn't that how our client
got into this mess?

34:12.680 --> 34:14.568
We're defending our client.

34:14.620 --> 34:15.769
BAILIFF:
All rise!

34:15.820 --> 34:19.142
The Honorable Erancis Flamm
preSIding.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.454
Well, good morning, everyone.

34:21.490 --> 34:23.651
It's good to see you all
here again.

34:23.690 --> 34:27.524
Oh, and I see we've grown by one
at the defense table.

34:27.560 --> 34:28.697
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

34:28.730 --> 34:31.324
I've been so moved
by the plight of Mr. Dolan

34:31.370 --> 34:33.520
that I have decided
to lend my assistance.

34:33.570 --> 34:35.458
Well, it's great to have you
in my court, Ms. Lockhart.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.593
And I understand
your team would like to argue

34:37.640 --> 34:38.664
a motion to dismiss.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.166
ALICIA:
Yes, Your Honor.

34:40.210 --> 34:44.169
The prosecutor has built
this case on one weak reed:

34:44.210 --> 34:45.677
a single eyewitness.

34:45.710 --> 34:48.178
An eyewitness who was
30 feet from the crime

34:48.220 --> 34:50.711
and who only identified
our client

34:50.750 --> 34:52.615
after seeing the police
questioning him.

34:52.650 --> 34:55.210
Mr. Dolan has no record.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.689
He is an innocent man,
Your Honor.

35:00.730 --> 35:03.551
And_it would be
unjust not to

35:03.600 --> 35:05.397
dismiss these charges.

35:05.430 --> 35:06.397
Let me.

35:06.430 --> 35:07.624
Let you, what?
Argue.

35:07.670 --> 35:08.864
Your Honor,

35:08.900 --> 35:12.609
injustice comes
in all shapes and sizes.

35:12.640 --> 35:15.279
It's not just in the man held,
it's also in the man released.

35:15.310 --> 35:17.437
My grandfather once said,

35:17.480 --> 35:21.746
"A judging brain requires
a listening ear."

35:21.780 --> 35:25.614
I think that was true then,
but it's doubly true now.

35:25.650 --> 35:28.687
You need to hear our full case
before you can deCIde.

35:28.720 --> 35:32.554
To dismiss before you hear
would be an injustice.

35:32.590 --> 35:36.299
Your grandfather is
the Reverend Roy Stonehouse?

35:36.330 --> 35:37.627
He is, Your Honor.

35:37.660 --> 35:40.629
Well, I'm honored.

35:40.670 --> 35:41.637
How is he?

35:41.670 --> 35:43.262
He's good.

35:43.300 --> 35:44.608
Uh, recovering.

35:44.640 --> 35:45.629
(chuckles)

35:45.670 --> 35:46.637
Well, please tell him

35:46.670 --> 35:47.534
how greatly he's admired.

35:47.570 --> 35:49.902
My first thesis I
wrote was on Selma.

35:49.940 --> 35:51.749
I'll tell him.

35:51.780 --> 35:54.874
And convey my respect, as well.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.445
We all owe men like
your grandfather

35:57.480 --> 35:59.289
a huge debt.

35:59.320 --> 36:02.881
But let's not forget that this
case is about an innocent man.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.524
Well, I think that still
needs to be determined,

36:04.560 --> 36:05.527
don't you, Counselor?

36:05.560 --> 36:07.221
Yes.

36:07.260 --> 36:08.557
What I meant, Your Honor...

36:08.600 --> 36:09.555
Yes, it's all right.

36:09.600 --> 36:10.624
I know what you meant.

36:10.660 --> 36:12.196
I just think that it would be

36:12.230 --> 36:14.198
unjust to
summarily dismiss

36:14.240 --> 36:18.199
this case before offering
"a listening ear."

36:18.240 --> 36:20.401
And so, your motion is
denied, Ms. Lockhart--

36:20.440 --> 36:22.237
and the other
two with you.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.702
Uh, we will move
directly to trial.

36:23.740 --> 36:24.741
(bangs gavel)

36:26.910 --> 36:28.673
Oh, and, uh, Ms. Stonehouse,
thank you.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.589
I have chills.

36:33.950 --> 36:36.817
I don't like
to use that much.

36:36.860 --> 36:39.522
Does it get you
into restaurants?

36:39.560 --> 36:40.549
(chuckles)

37:00.810 --> 37:02.346
I'm out.

37:02.380 --> 37:04.348
Oh, come on.

37:04.390 --> 37:05.982
Not when you're up like that.

37:06.020 --> 37:07.339
Yep, when I'm up like that.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.827
We'll be here tonight.

37:12.860 --> 37:14.999
After the Civil Mixer.

37:15.030 --> 37:17.919
I'm fine, thanks.

37:17.960 --> 37:20.360
Take you to breakfast?

37:20.400 --> 37:21.560
No.

37:21.600 --> 37:24.330
Geez, you sound
so definitive.

37:24.370 --> 37:25.928
Yep.

37:25.970 --> 37:28.677
So, I'll hear from you on
the baseball commissioner job?

37:28.710 --> 37:30.268
Celeste, no.

37:30.310 --> 37:32.540
I didn't like this life, not
even when I was living it.

37:32.580 --> 37:34.673
I didn't like not knowing when
I was being conned or conning.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.517
You don't think there's a job?

37:36.550 --> 37:38.381
No, I checked. In
ten or 15 years,

37:38.420 --> 37:40.445
there's a chance I could vie
for baseball commi55ioner.

37:40.490 --> 37:42.014
What a sad
thought that is.

37:42.060 --> 37:44.278
Losing what I love now to
chase something in the future.

37:44.330 --> 37:45.729
What do you love?

37:45.760 --> 37:47.580
You said,
"Losing what I love now."

37:47.630 --> 37:48.699
My job!

37:48.730 --> 37:49.958
I don't believe you.

37:50.000 --> 37:51.365
I don't believe
you love it.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.061
What you love is winning.

37:53.100 --> 37:56.297
And you can't win big enough
at Lockhart-Gardner.

37:56.340 --> 37:57.568
This is your dream.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.602
What happened
to pursuing your dream?

37:59.640 --> 38:01.335
What happened to work?

38:01.380 --> 38:03.632
Not everybody can
pursue their dreams.

38:03.680 --> 38:05.045
Someone has to work.

38:05.080 --> 38:08.072
Whoa. That is so sad.

38:08.110 --> 38:10.340
No. Not really.

38:10.380 --> 38:12.382
Take care.

38:14.050 --> 38:17.315
KALINDA:
That's the cashier's bay.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.749
And that's where
the shooter was.

38:19.790 --> 38:21.394
And the line of
sight checks out.

38:21.430 --> 38:22.328
I'm not seeing
what's good.

38:22.360 --> 38:23.918
The line of
sight checks out

38:23.960 --> 38:28.329
until the cashier reaches
under the counter for the gun.

38:28.370 --> 38:31.339
JULIUS:
The wall would've hidden
the cashier from view.

38:31.370 --> 38:33.759
And Boylan told the police
the cashier pulled the gun

38:33.810 --> 38:36.608
from a holster taped
under the counter.

38:36.640 --> 38:37.709
But he couldn't have seen him

38:37.740 --> 38:38.968
reach under the counter
for his gun.

38:39.010 --> 38:41.410
Unless he was in the store.

38:41.450 --> 38:44.942
Boylan tried to escape,
saw a patrol car pull up,

38:44.990 --> 38:48.858
and pretended to be
an eyewitness, not a killer.

38:50.520 --> 38:54.456
So, let's go talk to Cary.

39:08.910 --> 39:10.935
Only a few more minutes.

39:15.950 --> 39:18.418
I've always waited
for bad things to happen.

39:18.450 --> 39:19.849
Every day.

39:19.890 --> 39:21.858
Travis sees the
good things.

39:23.890 --> 39:25.585
And I'm always waiting
for the bad.

39:25.630 --> 39:26.881
Well, this is good.

39:26.930 --> 39:28.124
I know.

39:28.160 --> 39:30.458
I don't want to
be that anymore.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.422
The worst thing happened,
and we're still here.

39:34.470 --> 39:36.961
Will you thank
the other two lavwers?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.503
Oh, I will, but it was
really the prosecutor.

39:39.540 --> 39:42.100
He reversed himself.

39:52.520 --> 39:53.987
Can 1...? Oh.
Yes.

39:54.020 --> 39:56.159
(sobbing)

40:00.530 --> 40:01.554
Hey, buddy.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.160
How's it going?

40:18.140 --> 40:19.607
Yes?

40:19.650 --> 40:22.141
Oh, nothing.

40:22.180 --> 40:25.013
I'm, uh, just looking.

40:25.050 --> 40:27.416
An espresso machine
would be nice.

40:32.730 --> 40:33.958
Oh, hey.

40:33.990 --> 40:34.957
The release went well?

40:35.000 --> 40:36.991
It did.
You should've been there.

40:37.030 --> 40:39.021
No, I didn't
do enough.

40:41.770 --> 40:43.829
ALICIA:
Hi.

40:43.870 --> 40:45.132
Hi.

40:45.170 --> 40:46.535
How was whoring?

40:46.570 --> 40:48.060
Unproductive.

40:51.010 --> 40:53.547
Listen, about what I said
yesterday...

40:53.580 --> 40:55.241
Will, please.
I'm on the phone with my kids

40:55.280 --> 40:56.315
and I say, "I love you,"

40:56.350 --> 40:58.545
and then I'm on the phone
with my mother-in-law

40:58.590 --> 40:59.545
and I say, "I love you," too.

40:59.590 --> 41:00.545
It's an accident.

41:00.590 --> 41:03.081
Yes.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.929
But do you think we should talk?

41:04.960 --> 41:07.121
No, I don't, actually.

41:07.160 --> 41:08.559
You don't?

41:08.600 --> 41:10.750
No.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.665
You sure?

41:12.700 --> 41:14.497
I'm so sure.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.735
I've never been so sure.

41:21.110 --> 41:23.078
I'm not interested
in anyone else.

41:23.110 --> 41:25.874
Will...

41:25.910 --> 41:28.617
(whispers):
you're talking about it.

41:34.190 --> 41:35.509
No fuss, no muss.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.016
That's me.

41:49.740 --> 41:52.937
_ Cel_este Serrano_
is forming her own firm.

41:52.970 --> 41:58.647
Bankruptcy, litigation,
family law.

42:00.680 --> 42:02.568
I don't want to be
careful anymore.

42:02.620 --> 42:04.918
I don't want
to count every penny

42:04.950 --> 42:07.248
and worry more about failing
than doing what's right.

42:07.290 --> 42:09.588
Okay.

42:09.620 --> 42:11.759
Legal Aid is losing
its office space.

42:11.790 --> 42:15.248
Everybody's pulling back
because of the economy.

42:15.300 --> 42:17.029
I want to bring them in-house.

42:17.060 --> 42:19.290
There's room next to Eli.

42:19.330 --> 42:20.968
He won't like it,

42:21.000 --> 42:25.539
but he'll have to live with it
until we find more room.

42:27.840 --> 42:32.868
When our lawyers have free time,
they can offer it to Legal Aid.

42:32.910 --> 42:35.640
You should've
broken up on the phone.

42:43.660 --> 42:46.083
I want to do this.

42:46.130 --> 42:47.950
And I want your okay.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.706
Okay.

43:17.990 --> 43:21.994
