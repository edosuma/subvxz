00:04.134 --> 00:06.093
<i>In the criminal justice system,</i>

00:06.093 --> 00:07.398
<i>sexually based offenses</i>

00:07.398 --> 00:09.661
<i>are considered
especially heinous.</i>

00:09.661 --> 00:12.273
<i>In New York City,
the dedicated detectives</i>

00:12.273 --> 00:14.014
<i>who investigate
these vicious felonies</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:15.493
<i>are members of an elite squad</i>

00:15.493 --> 00:17.756
<i>known as
the Special Victims Unit.</i>

00:17.756 --> 00:19.193
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:20.716 --> 00:25.503
Human sexuality
is strange enough.

00:25.503 --> 00:28.854
But how do you,
as future criminologists,

00:28.854 --> 00:35.557
learn to prevent what is
compulsive, deviant, criminal?

00:35.557 --> 00:37.689
Well, that was rhetorical,
but yeah?

00:37.689 --> 00:38.995
Harsher laws.

00:38.995 --> 00:42.564
Sounds good on the surface,
but criminals

00:42.564 --> 00:46.350
don't obey laws like the rest
of us, especially predators.

00:46.350 --> 00:48.178
And there's a lot more
of them in the world

00:48.178 --> 00:49.875
than you might think.

00:49.875 --> 00:53.009
Economic opportunities
like these present themselves

00:53.009 --> 00:55.229
once in a lifetime
if you're lucky.

00:55.229 --> 00:58.145
So gentlemen,
despite the reluctance

00:58.145 --> 01:01.365
that your board has shown since
we shared our initial offer,

01:01.365 --> 01:04.107
I'm prepared to put some
teeth behind my bite

01:04.107 --> 01:07.850
and up the price 20%
to get this done.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.460
Stop wasting my time.

01:09.460 --> 01:14.030
Let's commit to this deal,
make some history.

01:14.030 --> 01:17.425
<i>Given the predator's desire
tends to overcome</i>

01:17.425 --> 01:19.818
<i>all rational thought...</i>

01:19.818 --> 01:22.299
Hey, we're still on
for tonight, right?

01:22.299 --> 01:23.953
Actually, something came up.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.955
Carla, you're killing me.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.957
Bring your wife.

01:27.957 --> 01:31.526
I told you, she's out of town
with her boyfriend.

01:31.526 --> 01:34.964
We're ethically non-monogamous.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.618
I'm sorry, Spencer.

01:36.618 --> 01:40.578
<i>There's no limit to how far
the sexual predator will go</i>

01:40.578 --> 01:42.450
<i>to satisfy his
or her compulsions.</i>

01:45.801 --> 01:48.412
Maggie, how's it going?

01:48.412 --> 01:50.153
Just working on this model
so we can

01:50.153 --> 01:51.981
close the deal with Tectonic.

01:51.981 --> 01:53.113
Speaking of which,
shouldn't you be

01:53.113 --> 01:54.505
in there with the lady shark?

01:54.505 --> 01:56.116
Yeah, look, I'm getting back.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.856
It's just,
there's a party tonight,

01:57.856 --> 01:59.249
and I can't show up alone.

01:59.249 --> 02:00.946
So bring your wife.

02:00.946 --> 02:04.036
She's out of town, and you're
the first person I thought of.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.473
Uh-huh.

02:05.473 --> 02:07.779
Look, I'm really busy, and I--

02:07.779 --> 02:09.129
don't think I'm gonna
have enough time

02:09.129 --> 02:10.434
to go home to Jersey and--

02:10.434 --> 02:12.654
Great, so we'll just
go straight from work.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.351
Yeah.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.919
<i>All of us do things
to blow off steam</i>

02:16.919 --> 02:20.531
<i>that we know
aren't good for us--</i>

02:20.531 --> 02:23.534
trips to Vegas, retail therapy,

02:23.534 --> 02:26.146
ordering a bottle
instead of a glass.

02:26.146 --> 02:30.498
These little ways that we allow
ourselves to lose control,

02:30.498 --> 02:35.198
they're a lot like
a controlled burn, you know,

02:35.198 --> 02:37.374
a small fire set
to burn off the dead brush

02:37.374 --> 02:39.637
so the whole forest
doesn't incinerate.

02:39.637 --> 02:42.814
Now,
criminal sexual compulsions,

02:42.814 --> 02:46.122
they tend to start off
small too.

02:46.122 --> 02:49.125
So the question is,
how can we learn

02:49.125 --> 02:53.216
to prevent them from becoming
a catastrophic blaze?

02:53.216 --> 02:55.740
Let's begin, shall we?

03:00.180 --> 03:01.311
Don't wake up the girls.

03:02.791 --> 03:03.748
Ow.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.883
I'm sorry.
Was it too hard?

03:07.883 --> 03:09.232
No.

03:09.232 --> 03:11.234
Do it again.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.588
Spencer, hey.

03:17.588 --> 03:20.025
Hey, wait up.
- What?

03:20.025 --> 03:24.160
Spencer, I thought you said
this was a work party.

03:24.160 --> 03:25.640
You got your computer,
don't you?

03:25.640 --> 03:27.119
Yeah.

03:27.119 --> 03:30.166
Find an outlet, get on the
Wi-Fi, finish that model.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.820
But you know what?

03:31.820 --> 03:34.431
Take ten minutes for yourself,
have a drink.

03:34.431 --> 03:37.347
Live a little.
- Yeah, but where are you--

03:38.522 --> 03:40.568
<i>♪ Don't let the party stop</i>

03:42.744 --> 03:44.920
<i>♪ Dance on the rooftops</i>

03:53.537 --> 03:55.191
Oh, I didn't order that.

03:55.191 --> 03:58.238
No, it's a gift
from an admirer.

04:01.153 --> 04:02.459
No, no, no.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.069
From that man.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.844
Hey, miss?

05:22.844 --> 05:24.149
Miss.

05:24.149 --> 05:26.413
You okay?

05:32.462 --> 05:33.768
Miss.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.030
Miss!

06:24.775 --> 06:26.995
Somebody's got
a pep in her step.

06:26.995 --> 06:28.605
I told you, I had
a good night last night.

06:28.605 --> 06:31.216
Let me get this straight,
they wanted Carisi to do

06:31.216 --> 06:32.914
a lecture
at his old law school,

06:32.914 --> 06:34.611
and he volunteers you
at last minute?

06:34.611 --> 06:36.265
- Yeah.
- I'd be pissed.

06:36.265 --> 06:39.660
I was pissed at first,
but it was kind of fun.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.836
Yeah, Professor Rollins
does have a ring to it.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.098
- Uh-huh.
- Sergeant, Detective.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.578
Hey.
What you got for us?

06:44.578 --> 06:45.796
A real weird one.

06:45.796 --> 06:47.450
Vic's name is Maggie D'Angelo.

06:47.450 --> 06:51.062
Early 30s, signs of sexual
trauma, refused a rape kit.

06:51.062 --> 06:53.325
What's the weird part?

06:53.325 --> 06:56.154
Throat's in bad shape,
fingertip bruising on her neck.

06:56.154 --> 06:58.243
Toxicology shows alcohol
and scopolamine.

06:58.243 --> 07:00.158
Scopolamine?
That's rare.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.333
Right, those put you
in a highly

07:01.333 --> 07:02.596
suggestible twilight state.

07:02.596 --> 07:03.684
How'd she get here?

07:03.684 --> 07:06.338
Guy over there
brought her in.

07:06.338 --> 07:09.429
One more thing, she pulled
this thong out of her throat.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.475
Have the lab
run them for DNA.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.346
I'll go talk
to our friend over there.

07:14.346 --> 07:15.957
All right.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.480
Is she able to speak yet?

07:17.480 --> 07:19.830
Yeah, just asked
for the Wi-Fi password.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.571
Okay, thanks.

07:26.358 --> 07:29.449
Maggie, I'm Detective Rollins.

07:29.449 --> 07:33.191
Yeah, um, I told the nurse
that I didn't need any cops.

07:33.191 --> 07:36.238
I'm fine.
It was just a dumb party.

07:36.238 --> 07:38.370
Okay, because someone
had to bring you here

07:38.370 --> 07:40.198
to the hospital.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.461
Do you remember that?

07:42.984 --> 07:45.508
Um...

07:45.508 --> 07:48.163
not really, but it must have
been the drinks.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.860
I have a low tolerance.

07:49.860 --> 07:51.383
You were drugged.

07:51.383 --> 07:53.777
And there are signs that
you've been sexually assaulted.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.562
That's not possible.

07:58.086 --> 08:00.436
I had cervical cancer
a few years back,

08:00.436 --> 08:02.264
and I never had the treatments
that would allow me

08:02.264 --> 08:04.701
to regain sexual function.

08:04.701 --> 08:06.877
A lot of scar tissue.

08:06.877 --> 08:08.444
I'm very sorry.

08:10.402 --> 08:13.493
Could you tell me
about the party?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.669
Sorry, you don't
really understand.

08:15.669 --> 08:17.801
My boss is on his way here.

08:17.801 --> 08:20.630
I get it, but something
did happen to you last night.

08:20.630 --> 08:23.067
Our company is about
to be bought for $2 billion,

08:23.067 --> 08:26.244
which, frankly,
is a lot more important to me

08:26.244 --> 08:27.507
than one bad night.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.292
I didn't touch that girl.

08:30.292 --> 08:31.902
Never said you did.

08:31.902 --> 08:33.164
I helped her.

08:33.164 --> 08:34.601
I picked her up,
and I took her here.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.732
Where'd you find her?

08:35.732 --> 08:37.995
West 10th Street, my street.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.562
They call me West 10th Wilson.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.695
Okay.
Was anyone with her?

08:41.695 --> 08:43.087
Nah.

08:43.087 --> 08:48.092
But she was being chased
by a giant crow.

08:50.094 --> 08:53.097
Maggie, I'm here to help you.

08:53.097 --> 08:54.925
I have a lot of work to do.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.666
I understand that.
I get that.

08:56.666 --> 08:58.668
Whatever you think
happened to me,

08:58.668 --> 09:00.104
it just--it couldn't have.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.323
Because you're covered
in bruises,

09:01.323 --> 09:02.716
so somebody gave them to you.

09:02.716 --> 09:04.761
Maggie has a visitor.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.154
Spencer.

09:06.154 --> 09:07.285
I'm assuming
you're Maggie's boss.

09:07.285 --> 09:08.809
Spencer Lewis.
Maggie, what happened?

09:08.809 --> 09:10.245
I tried to find you last night.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.986
Wait, you were
at the party together?

09:11.986 --> 09:13.378
Yeah, I thought
she went home to work

09:13.378 --> 09:14.641
on our valuation model.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.077
I'm almost done with that.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.469
Where are my clothes?

09:21.125 --> 09:25.956
I--I wasn't raped,
so you can leave now.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.741
Maggie, I hear you.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.351
But it's just best if we go
ahead and collect evidence,

09:29.351 --> 09:30.787
and then maybe you'll
remember something--

09:30.787 --> 09:32.354
I said no.

09:36.097 --> 09:38.012
I'm sorry, um,
help me understand.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.317
The hospital called the cops

09:39.317 --> 09:40.971
because they think Maggie
was assaulted?

09:40.971 --> 09:43.147
There is evidence
of that, yes.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.802
Well, she doesn't seem
to think so.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.456
Maggie is in denial.

09:47.456 --> 09:48.979
There's drugs in her system.

09:48.979 --> 09:52.330
She doesn't remember it yet.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.376
What can you tell me
about this party?

09:57.205 --> 09:59.337
Uh, it was just
a Wall Street type thing,

09:59.337 --> 10:01.818
mixed with a bunch of
Burning Man billionaires

10:01.818 --> 10:04.647
and polyamorous tech bros.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.301
And who was hosting?

10:06.301 --> 10:08.738
Do you have any idea how many
parties I go to in a night?

10:08.738 --> 10:11.611
No, I don't, but I'm sure
you have the address.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.702
Yeah, we took a quick ride
from the office.

10:19.401 --> 10:21.098
I know you're
just doing your job,

10:21.098 --> 10:23.710
but I'm fine.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.189
Okay.

10:25.189 --> 10:26.582
I'm almost done with this.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.062
Don't worry about that
right now.

10:28.062 --> 10:29.498
Let's just get you home,
all right?

10:29.498 --> 10:32.414
Maggie, listen.
Will you just take my card?

10:32.414 --> 10:34.155
If you change your mind,
if you remember anything,

10:34.155 --> 10:35.417
you can give me a call.

10:37.941 --> 10:38.986
What are we looking at?

10:38.986 --> 10:41.162
I've seen shock and denial,

10:41.162 --> 10:42.946
but that takes it
to a whole nother level.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.948
And her boss was in a hurry
to get out of here.

10:44.948 --> 10:47.211
I saw the wedding ring.
I get it.

10:47.211 --> 10:48.691
Or he's the one that raped her.

10:48.691 --> 10:49.866
Well, he gave me
the address of the party,

10:49.866 --> 10:51.389
West 10th Street.

10:51.389 --> 10:53.043
Let's stop by there
on the way back to the station.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.393
My man.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.395
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.701
Is she going to be okay?

10:58.701 --> 10:59.702
She thinks so.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.141
Did he give you anything?

11:04.141 --> 11:05.882
He's not the most
reliable witness.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.579
He blamed it on a crow.

11:07.579 --> 11:08.406
What?

11:08.406 --> 11:10.017
That's all I got.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.284
How long has this place
been on the market?

11:16.284 --> 11:18.112
Over a year.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.027
Has it been empty
the whole time?

11:20.027 --> 11:21.463
It's a $15 million property.

11:21.463 --> 11:22.812
They don't go fast these days,

11:22.812 --> 11:24.205
especially with
these interest rates.

11:24.205 --> 11:25.423
Anyone else have a key?

11:25.423 --> 11:27.295
Just the property manager.

11:30.820 --> 11:34.302
So this brownstone where
the party was supposedly held

11:34.302 --> 11:35.564
was unoccupied?

11:35.564 --> 11:37.087
According to the realtor.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.872
No renter, no one has access.

11:38.872 --> 11:41.613
And the victim nor the guy
who invited her

11:41.613 --> 11:43.746
has any idea
whose party this was?

11:43.746 --> 11:45.269
We ran the address.

11:45.269 --> 11:46.444
The property is owned
by some big-time

11:46.444 --> 11:47.881
asset management company.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.665
We're sorting through
the chain of title.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.972
All right, and this Maggie
had a pair of underwear

11:51.972 --> 11:53.147
lodged in her throat?

11:53.147 --> 11:55.671
Not to mention scopolamine.

11:55.671 --> 11:58.108
Well, that doesn't
sound consensual.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.283
We're running DNA.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.720
Yeah, the lab's
got a rush on it.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.504
West 10th Street
was empty this morning.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.462
Security camera
on the block picked up

12:04.462 --> 12:08.945
the homeless guy and our vic,

12:08.945 --> 12:11.295
and you're never gonna
believe this, but...

12:15.430 --> 12:17.301
A guy in a crow mask.

12:17.301 --> 12:20.478
So West 10th Wilson
was telling the truth.

12:20.478 --> 12:23.351
So maybe he wasn't
so crazy after all.

12:33.143 --> 12:35.189
Do you remember being there?

12:35.189 --> 12:37.800
It was very dark.
there was a lot of people.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.455
Does anything else
come to mind?

12:40.455 --> 12:42.805
I mean, I thought it
was a work party at first,

12:42.805 --> 12:45.939
but it definitely was not.

12:45.939 --> 12:48.115
Can you tell me more
about that?

12:48.115 --> 12:52.859
There was a sexual
undercurrent to everything.

12:52.859 --> 12:57.211
Like I told you this morning,
I can't have sex.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.779
This is a security cam
still from the street

12:59.779 --> 13:01.084
you were found on.

13:01.084 --> 13:02.651
Do you remember
anyone at the party

13:02.651 --> 13:03.913
wearing a mask like this?

13:14.837 --> 13:16.230
He sent me a drink.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.102
I had a few sips.

13:19.102 --> 13:21.801
Okay, what else do you
remember about him?

13:24.194 --> 13:26.240
His voice.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.160
It was gentle.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.205
Can you tell us what he said?

13:38.818 --> 13:42.212
He...

13:42.212 --> 13:47.914
told me that I had a neck
like a Modigliani painting,

13:47.914 --> 13:50.612
and that's literally
all I remember.

13:50.612 --> 13:51.918
The drug that you were given,

13:51.918 --> 13:53.745
it can have an effect
on your memory.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.486
And what if
it doesn't come back?

13:55.486 --> 13:58.185
Are you telling me I've lost
eight hours of my life?

13:58.185 --> 14:00.187
Maggie, there was a pair
of women's underwear

14:00.187 --> 14:02.972
that was brought in with you.

14:02.972 --> 14:04.887
They were in your throat.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.805
Do you remember that?

14:12.286 --> 14:13.243
No.

14:15.245 --> 14:18.901
The lab did find
semen on them.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.907
Now would be a good time
to do a rape kit.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.779
Okay.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.437
What can you tell us
about your boss?

14:37.267 --> 14:40.836
So you're saying Maggie
really was assaulted?

14:43.708 --> 14:45.710
Why would I hurt her?

14:45.710 --> 14:47.234
I'd be dead in the water
without her.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.018
That girl's a genius
with numbers.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.628
So you took her
to a sex party?

14:50.628 --> 14:54.023
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's just slow this down.

14:54.023 --> 14:55.895
It was a business party.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.113
You see him with Maggie?

14:58.854 --> 15:00.421
- I was occupied.
- Yeah, I'll bet you were.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.945
My wife and I
have a wonderful marriage.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.207
I've been nothing
but cooperative here.

15:04.207 --> 15:05.992
That address you gave us,

15:05.992 --> 15:07.428
somebody cleaned it up
real fast.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.386
We're gonna need
to see a guest list.

15:09.386 --> 15:11.954
Rich people value
one thing more than money.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.390
What's that?

15:13.390 --> 15:15.653
- Discretion.
- Wanna put that to the test?

15:15.653 --> 15:17.351
Your company's in the middle
of being acquired.

15:17.351 --> 15:19.092
I have a friend named Leo
at IRS

15:19.092 --> 15:20.920
that might want to look
at your books.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.400
Nice bluff, but he
wouldn't find anything.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.011
Yeah, but that would hit
a pause button real fast

15:25.011 --> 15:26.490
on that deal of yours.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.886
Okay, look,
I've got an invitation

15:30.886 --> 15:32.148
to another party tonight.

15:32.148 --> 15:34.498
Let me see if I can get
a plus-one.

15:34.498 --> 15:35.586
Hate to break it to you.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.414
It's gonna be more
like a plus-five.

15:37.414 --> 15:40.026
And in return, I would like
to invite the inside

15:40.026 --> 15:42.506
of your cheek to a swab party.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.468
Okay, look, I can come down
to the station.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.644
Shh. Say "ah."

15:49.644 --> 15:51.254
Ah--ah.

15:54.866 --> 15:56.825
Excuse me. Who are you?

15:56.825 --> 15:58.305
NYPD.

15:58.305 --> 16:01.134
- I need to see some ID.
- Oh, Henry, it's okay.

16:01.134 --> 16:02.222
They're just doing their jobs.

16:02.222 --> 16:04.354
I apologize. I'm Lena Hess.

16:04.354 --> 16:06.530
We're in the middle
of acquiring

16:06.530 --> 16:08.663
White & Jensen Equities.

16:08.663 --> 16:10.665
It's a delicate time.

16:10.665 --> 16:13.320
I saw that you were talking
with Spencer?

16:13.320 --> 16:15.496
Yeah, he seemed to notice
you looking too.

16:15.496 --> 16:19.021
Oh, we have a morality clause
in all of our contracts.

16:19.021 --> 16:21.676
Spencer will soon be
my direct report.

16:21.676 --> 16:24.461
If he's involved in a criminal
matter, I'd like to know.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.550
We don't discuss
police business.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.117
I understand.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.076
But if there's anything
I can help with personally

16:30.076 --> 16:32.165
while you continue
to investigate him,

16:32.165 --> 16:34.689
a character reference
or his whereabouts

16:34.689 --> 16:37.387
at a given place and time,

16:37.387 --> 16:38.606
don't hesitate.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.912
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.179
Even her card smells rich.

16:47.180 --> 16:49.704
So we took Spencer's samples
straight to the lab.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.140
And?

16:51.140 --> 16:53.621
And the DNA from your
rape kit wasn't Spencer's.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.057
Then whose was it?

16:55.057 --> 16:56.537
We don't know.

16:56.537 --> 17:00.149
And it wasn't a match
to anything in our database.

17:00.149 --> 17:02.064
There was nothing, right?

17:02.064 --> 17:04.632
I mean, I can't have sex.

17:04.632 --> 17:05.807
I'm sorry, Maggie.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.330
You were assaulted.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.943
It wasn't vaginally.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.600
I know that may
be hard to hear,

17:16.600 --> 17:19.081
but considering the time frame,
we're lucky to have

17:19.081 --> 17:21.388
collected evidence at all.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.172
Why did I not
help you this morning?

17:23.172 --> 17:25.087
Because you were in denial,

17:25.087 --> 17:27.220
and that is not uncommon, Maggie.

17:27.220 --> 17:30.571
As a matter of fact,
it's normal.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.443
Look, I just--

17:35.445 --> 17:38.013
I just want to find out
what happened

17:38.013 --> 17:39.493
during those
missing eight hours.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.103
And so do we.

17:41.103 --> 17:44.193
We understand from Spencer
that there's a party tonight.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.977
Someone there may be able
to lead us

17:45.977 --> 17:47.283
to the man who assaulted you.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.633
- And you want me to go.
- No, no, no.

17:49.633 --> 17:52.810
But if we do find a lead,
we are gonna need you

17:52.810 --> 17:54.508
to help us make the ID.

17:54.508 --> 17:58.251
Well, how am I gonna do that
if I didn't see his face?

17:58.251 --> 18:01.819
You let us worry about that.

18:10.654 --> 18:14.310
Same crowd Maggie described
at last night's party.

18:16.312 --> 18:17.531
Any sign of our crow?

18:17.531 --> 18:19.141
Spencer might have
warned the guy.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.622
Or he showed up maskless.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.145
I don't want to take a chance
that anyone else

18:23.145 --> 18:25.800
gets assaulted in that house.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.149
Copy that.

18:30.152 --> 18:32.198
Hey. Sorry, guys.
This is a private event.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.982
We have an invitation.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.997
- Drugs.
- Check.

18:48.997 --> 18:51.217
- Young girls.
- Check.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.609
I'll do the honors.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.657
NYPD, the party's over.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.137
Nobody's leaving.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.886
I thought you'd want to see
this, behind the furnace room.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.192
Had to cut the lock.

19:15.719 --> 19:17.417
Security system.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.767
That camera's
in the bathroom.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.248
I want all these
hard drives seized.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.250
Yeah, I'll call Carisi,
tell him we need a warrant

19:24.250 --> 19:26.295
so TARU can access them.

19:26.295 --> 19:28.341
What the hell
are we looking at?

19:28.341 --> 19:30.560
This whole damn place
is rigged up.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.219
So your modeling
agent invited you?

19:37.219 --> 19:38.699
Man can't get in
without woman.

19:38.699 --> 19:39.656
Did you happen to go
to the party

19:39.656 --> 19:40.831
in the West Village last night?

19:40.831 --> 19:42.659
I go to all of these things.

19:42.659 --> 19:44.835
Did you see this man there?

19:44.835 --> 19:46.489
Guy in a crow mask?
I didn't see him tonight.

19:46.489 --> 19:47.664
But he was there last night.

19:47.664 --> 19:49.449
Do you know his name?

19:49.449 --> 19:51.494
I've seen him a few times.
I recognize the mask.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.017
I have no idea who he is.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.367
Okay, because we have
reason to believe

19:54.367 --> 19:56.804
that a woman was sexually
assaulted at that party.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.501
I find that surprising.

19:58.501 --> 20:00.024
I mean, he's got a thing
for choking.

20:00.024 --> 20:01.722
He tried it on one
of my models once.

20:01.722 --> 20:03.637
But when she said the
safe word, he stopped.

20:03.637 --> 20:05.247
Yeah, well,
these things can escalate.

20:05.247 --> 20:08.337
So how do you hear
about these things?

20:08.337 --> 20:09.686
I just work here, all right?

20:09.686 --> 20:11.166
I'm not actually
into this stuff.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.211
I get it.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.213
My fetish is green
and colored too.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.388
Who hires you?

20:15.388 --> 20:16.693
I couldn't even say
if I wanted to.

20:16.693 --> 20:18.695
All anonymous,
given a time and address,

20:18.695 --> 20:20.131
then I get paid in crypto.

20:21.394 --> 20:22.786
You got the warrant?

20:22.786 --> 20:24.092
You pulled the entire system
out of the building?

20:24.092 --> 20:25.572
And the 20 hard drives,
all of the cameras.

20:25.572 --> 20:26.703
We sent everything to TARU.

20:26.703 --> 20:27.835
You know you'll
need another warrant

20:27.835 --> 20:29.271
to look at that footage.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.881
And another one for the
brownstone on 10th Street.

20:30.881 --> 20:32.666
That one could be wired up too.

20:32.666 --> 20:33.971
Where Maggie was assaulted.

20:33.971 --> 20:35.886
By a man in a crow mask.

20:35.886 --> 20:37.888
And we're still nowhere
in ID'ing this guy?

20:37.888 --> 20:39.281
Nobody knows anything.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.544
I mean, we made a couple
of arrests for possession,

20:41.544 --> 20:42.893
but they've all lawyered up.

20:42.893 --> 20:44.112
And the rest of them
are just

20:44.112 --> 20:45.896
Wall Street guys
playing dress-up.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.463
There's no underage girls.

20:47.463 --> 20:50.423
All sexual activity, except for
Maggie, seems consensual.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.076
But as far as we know, anything

20:52.076 --> 20:53.687
could be on those hard drives.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.297
I'm assuming whoever
hosted those parties

20:55.297 --> 20:56.516
put the cameras in?

20:56.516 --> 20:57.691
These people went
to a lot of trouble

20:57.691 --> 20:59.519
to make sure that Manhattan's

20:59.519 --> 21:01.912
power brokers
were naked on film.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.523
Not just naked,
but they recorded

21:03.523 --> 21:04.698
their secret perversions.

21:04.698 --> 21:05.873
So what are we
looking at here?

21:05.873 --> 21:08.179
Blackmail scheme?
- A kompromat operation.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.746
Look, if the house
in the West Village

21:09.746 --> 21:11.748
was wired up like this one,

21:11.748 --> 21:15.099
that means that Maggie's
assault was recorded.

21:15.099 --> 21:17.798
So we have a uni out front
making sure

21:17.798 --> 21:19.669
that nobody's
removing evidence.

21:19.669 --> 21:22.193
I'll get you those warrants.

21:22.193 --> 21:23.760
Real Time Crime
finished tracking

21:23.760 --> 21:25.588
chain of title
on both properties.

21:25.588 --> 21:27.677
The company that owns them all?

21:27.677 --> 21:28.896
Tectonic.

21:28.896 --> 21:30.724
The woman with the bodyguard?

21:30.724 --> 21:32.029
Lena Hess.

21:32.029 --> 21:34.684
Her company
acquiring Spencer's.

21:34.684 --> 21:36.295
There's $2 billion at stake.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.992
Well, that's a hell
of a coincidence.

21:37.992 --> 21:41.604
Or one hell of a motive
for blackmail.

21:45.869 --> 21:47.741
Apologies for the wait.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.569
Nice to see you again.

21:49.569 --> 21:51.135
We weren't
properly introduced.

21:51.135 --> 21:54.051
I'm Sergeant Tutuola,
and this is Captain Benson.

21:54.051 --> 21:56.967
So we understand
that your company, Tectonic,

21:56.967 --> 21:59.448
is in the process
of buying Spencer Lewis's?

21:59.448 --> 22:03.191
Excuse me, may I ask how
capitalism is a police matter?

22:03.191 --> 22:07.238
It's not, but it becomes one
when your company owns

22:07.238 --> 22:10.024
a property where
a woman was attacked.

22:10.024 --> 22:12.940
The West 10th Street brownstone.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.376
So you're aware.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.204
Well, my head of security, Henry,

22:16.204 --> 22:18.685
informed me that
a search warrant

22:18.685 --> 22:20.817
was executed there today.

22:20.817 --> 22:22.384
That's all I know.

22:22.384 --> 22:24.168
You're saying a woman
was assaulted?

22:24.168 --> 22:27.128
At a party held
at your property.

22:27.128 --> 22:30.784
Do you have any idea
who threw it or who had access?

22:30.784 --> 22:32.307
The property manager
has a key.

22:32.307 --> 22:34.048
We're in the process
of selling it

22:34.048 --> 22:36.180
in the Gramercy Park townhouse.

22:36.180 --> 22:38.705
I was informed there was
a party there last night too.

22:40.837 --> 22:42.491
Do you have any idea
how that happened?

22:42.491 --> 22:46.408
Well, it's a breach of trust
somewhere along the line.

22:46.408 --> 22:49.324
My head of security is trying
to get to the bottom of it.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.197
We were hoping you could help
us get to the bottom of it.

22:53.197 --> 22:56.418
Both the properties
are wired with hidden cameras.

22:56.418 --> 23:00.509
We're talking about
$20 million assets.

23:00.509 --> 23:01.684
Security is an issue.

23:01.684 --> 23:03.251
So is blackmail.

23:03.251 --> 23:06.733
I have been the victim
of that once or twice myself.

23:06.733 --> 23:08.822
And my world is dog-eat-dog,

23:08.822 --> 23:10.432
and doing business
at a scale like my own

23:10.432 --> 23:12.869
is a never-ending game
of brinksmanship.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.915
I can only imagine.

23:17.439 --> 23:18.919
If someone's using
my properties

23:18.919 --> 23:21.443
to throw illegal parties,
do you realize

23:21.443 --> 23:22.923
the liability for me here?

23:24.838 --> 23:26.883
I'm gonna need a copy
of that footage.

23:26.883 --> 23:28.755
It's a police matter now.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.452
Well, I'm so very glad
that it is.

23:30.452 --> 23:31.758
Yeah, thank you.

23:33.542 --> 23:36.458
You know, if we find out
that you have any connection

23:36.458 --> 23:38.547
to this assault,

23:38.547 --> 23:41.202
whether it's overt or implied,

23:41.202 --> 23:43.422
I'm coming back here
with a gift.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.119
What's that?

23:45.119 --> 23:46.990
A pair of bracelets.

23:50.951 --> 23:53.127
So we recovered
hidden camera footage

23:53.127 --> 23:55.085
from the brownstone
where Maggie was assaulted.

23:55.085 --> 23:56.652
You know those
expedited warrants

23:56.652 --> 23:58.437
are limited in scope to the
weekend of the crime, right?

23:58.437 --> 23:59.960
Right now,
that's all we need.

23:59.960 --> 24:02.005
Let me guess,
Lena Hess denies it all?

24:02.005 --> 24:04.443
Oh, yeah, she's claiming
that the surveillance

24:04.443 --> 24:07.184
was for security purposes only.
- Yeah, of course she does.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.012
The class of people involved
there are Manhattan's

24:09.012 --> 24:10.666
wealthiest, most powerful.

24:10.666 --> 24:13.452
Yet nobody recognizes them
when they walk down the street.

24:14.801 --> 24:16.498
That's by design.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.369
You're not telling me
to tread lightly

24:18.369 --> 24:19.762
because it's Lena Hess,
are you?

24:19.762 --> 24:21.416
These people operate under

24:21.416 --> 24:23.331
an entirely different
justice system.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.159
Which really sucks,
doesn't it?

24:27.161 --> 24:29.946
- Did you invite her here?
- No, I didn't.

24:29.946 --> 24:32.296
But I certainly
admire her tenacity.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.213
Maggie.

24:36.213 --> 24:38.738
Hey.
- Hey, I left you a message.

24:38.738 --> 24:40.000
Yes, I know.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.828
Look, I didn't want
to call you back

24:41.828 --> 24:44.308
until I had news to share.

24:44.308 --> 24:46.615
And?

24:46.615 --> 24:48.008
Is it in there? Can I see it?

24:48.008 --> 24:51.577
No, honey, it doesn't
quite work like that.

24:51.577 --> 24:53.840
Cancer took my body
away from me once.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.798
I just--I cannot do this again.

24:55.798 --> 25:01.587
Okay, recovering from trauma
can be a full-time job.

25:01.587 --> 25:04.633
But I also have a job to do.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.156
Right?

25:06.156 --> 25:09.638
And that job is for both of us.

25:09.638 --> 25:12.859
So just trust me and know that

25:12.859 --> 25:14.730
I will get in touch
with you the minute

25:14.730 --> 25:17.341
I have anything concrete, okay?

25:21.607 --> 25:22.782
Was that Maggie?

25:22.782 --> 25:24.131
Yeah, she just left.

25:24.131 --> 25:26.089
Good. We found him.

25:32.356 --> 25:36.839
He chokes her out completely
a total of seven times.

25:36.839 --> 25:38.188
I'm looking at
criminal sexual act

25:38.188 --> 25:39.755
in the first
and attempted murder.

25:39.755 --> 25:42.715
Then he stuffs her panties
in her mouth and does this.

25:45.848 --> 25:48.851
We need to find
this son of a bitch.

25:48.851 --> 25:51.027
Fido here might be able
to tell us.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.204
That's Spencer?

25:54.204 --> 25:56.859
You said he didn't know
the guy in the crow mask.

25:56.859 --> 25:58.905
Well, maybe if
we show him this,

25:58.905 --> 26:00.559
it'll refresh his memory.

26:07.043 --> 26:09.872
- Where'd you get this?
- Those parties that you go to?

26:09.872 --> 26:11.482
All the houses were wired up.

26:11.482 --> 26:12.875
Oh, crap.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.616
There's no law against S&M.

26:14.616 --> 26:15.704
No one's threatening
legal action

26:15.704 --> 26:17.663
against his proclivities.

26:17.663 --> 26:20.622
But obstructing justice,
protecting a sexual predator

26:20.622 --> 26:22.581
is a good way to find
yourself in handcuffs--

26:22.581 --> 26:23.886
and, uh, not the good kind.

26:23.886 --> 26:25.540
I had absolutely
nothing to do

26:25.540 --> 26:26.759
with Maggie getting assaulted.

26:26.759 --> 26:28.195
No, 'cause we've
got a witness saying that

26:28.195 --> 26:29.588
all male guests
have to bring a woman

26:29.588 --> 26:30.980
as the price of admission.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.852
I mean, yeah,
but that has nothing--

26:32.852 --> 26:34.418
The last I checked,
she's an adult woman

26:34.418 --> 26:35.855
with agency and volition.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.639
Did Maggie know what
she was getting into?

26:37.639 --> 26:39.554
Look, what do you
want from me?

26:39.554 --> 26:42.818
I want the identity
of this man.

26:42.818 --> 26:44.559
Wait, that's the guy?

26:44.559 --> 26:46.822
- Oh, so you do know him?
- I've seen him.

26:46.822 --> 26:48.519
Well, you've seen
the footage we have of you.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.652
I would get more specific
real quick.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.262
What is this,
Blackmail Spencer Day?

26:52.262 --> 26:53.612
No, no, no.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.961
Think of it as saving you
from whoever installed

26:54.961 --> 26:56.919
those cameras
because they clearly

26:56.919 --> 26:59.574
intended to use that footage
as leverage of some kind.

26:59.574 --> 27:00.619
Yeah, well,
my wife won't care.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.968
Yeah.

27:01.968 --> 27:03.447
You're selling your company,
though, aren't you?

27:03.447 --> 27:05.667
Shareholders might.

27:05.667 --> 27:07.277
Oh, look at
Mr. Blumfeld over here.

27:07.277 --> 27:09.540
Suddenly he's worried that
the checks won't clear.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.632
Just tell them
what you know, Spencer.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.116
We met last month.

27:20.116 --> 27:23.293
I don't know his name,
but he mentioned

27:23.293 --> 27:25.687
that he's a timpanist

27:25.687 --> 27:28.124
for the New York Orchestra.

27:41.660 --> 27:43.836
Ethan Schmidt!

27:46.186 --> 27:47.970
Hey! Ethan Schmidt.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.972
You're under arrest
for criminal sexual act

27:49.972 --> 27:53.280
in the first
and attempted murder.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.151
- Come on.
- Let's go.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.939
Ethan Schmidt,
what do we know about him?

27:59.939 --> 28:02.115
Two kids, married, no record.

28:02.115 --> 28:04.726
We searched his house
and found the crow mask.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.206
What about the twilight drug
he gave Maggie?

28:06.206 --> 28:08.295
We found it in a drawer
in his study.

28:08.295 --> 28:10.036
Counselor, we have enough?

28:10.036 --> 28:11.472
A victim ID
would seal the deal.

28:11.472 --> 28:14.257
Maggie said herself
she couldn't see his face.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.956
No, but she heard his voice.

28:18.609 --> 28:20.176
How did you find him?

28:20.176 --> 28:22.875
Well, you're not the only
workaholic in New York.

28:22.875 --> 28:25.573
We caught his face on film.

28:25.573 --> 28:27.967
My assault was recorded?

28:27.967 --> 28:29.446
You are gonna get rid
of that, right?

28:29.446 --> 28:30.752
It's evidence.

28:30.752 --> 28:33.973
But right now, let's focus
on making the ID.

28:33.973 --> 28:35.801
All right, you heard his voice.

28:35.801 --> 28:38.020
Yeah, I'll never forget it.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.370
So, Maggie,
this is Mr. Carisi.

28:40.370 --> 28:41.850
He's our ADA.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.200
And he's gonna show you
how the voice ID works.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.376
Yeah. Take a seat.

28:46.376 --> 28:49.771
You'll hear seven voices
repeat the same sentence,

28:49.771 --> 28:51.468
the one you recall
the perpetrator saying.

28:51.468 --> 28:53.644
Now, you can hear them
as many times as you need.

28:53.644 --> 28:54.863
Okay?
- Okay.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.125
Can we hurry this up?

28:56.125 --> 28:58.084
My client's been waiting
all afternoon.

28:58.084 --> 29:00.303
Well, he should get used
to it because where he's going,

29:00.303 --> 29:01.740
there's not much else to do.

29:04.264 --> 29:06.135
Here, why don't you
go slide those on?

29:08.311 --> 29:09.748
Okay, you ready?

29:09.748 --> 29:11.532
- Yeah.
- Okay.

29:15.188 --> 29:17.930
<i>You have a neck
like a Modigliani.</i>

29:22.935 --> 29:26.112
<i>You have a neck
like a Modigliani.</i>

29:30.464 --> 29:33.119
<i>You have a neck
like a Modigliani.</i>

29:35.599 --> 29:36.687
That's him.

29:40.126 --> 29:42.128
It's number three. That's him.

29:45.218 --> 29:47.524
The jury's gonna
see this for what it is--

29:47.524 --> 29:50.353
a phishing expedition
using an illegally recorded

29:50.353 --> 29:52.094
consensual sex act.

29:52.094 --> 29:55.097
The victim doesn't
see it that way.

29:55.097 --> 29:57.447
And we have video of your
client choking a young woman

29:57.447 --> 30:00.102
in and out of consciousness,
resuscitating her

30:00.102 --> 30:02.931
again and again so that
he can keep going.

30:02.931 --> 30:04.541
The only reason he stopped
is because

30:04.541 --> 30:05.804
he thought he killed her.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.806
What's a jury gonna say
when they see him

30:07.806 --> 30:09.329
put her on a sheet of plastic?

30:09.329 --> 30:12.811
And that's just the victim
he got caught for.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.943
How many are there?

30:18.338 --> 30:20.819
I don't understand
what's wrong with me.

30:21.907 --> 30:25.258
It started so young
when I strangled

30:25.258 --> 30:27.913
my sister's pet bird.

30:27.913 --> 30:30.829
What is that, is that guilt?

30:30.829 --> 30:34.136
No, it's, um, not guild.

30:34.136 --> 30:36.225
Uh--relief.

30:39.533 --> 30:42.971
I've been struggling with
this compulsion my whole life.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.886
I just want it to stop.

30:49.369 --> 30:50.892
I'll tell you who throws
these parties

30:50.892 --> 30:52.154
if you just get me some help.

30:52.154 --> 30:54.113
What does my client
get in return?

30:54.113 --> 30:55.897
I can't make any promises.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.218
A donor to the orchestra.

31:12.218 --> 31:14.829
She's one of the most
powerful women in this city.

31:14.829 --> 31:17.353
I met her one night
after a performance.

31:17.353 --> 31:18.398
We started talking.

31:18.398 --> 31:19.486
What about?

31:22.968 --> 31:26.623
The quasi ritenente crescendo
in Brahms' Symphony 2.

31:26.623 --> 31:30.497
She asked me why I chose to
devote my life to the timpani.

31:30.497 --> 31:33.326
I told her it was the
construction of that piece.

31:37.286 --> 31:38.766
It is sublime.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.032
She thought so too.

31:44.032 --> 31:46.687
Who is the "she"
in that sentence?

31:53.172 --> 31:54.260
Lena Hess.

31:57.393 --> 32:00.701
You're saying Lena Hess
threw these parties?

32:00.701 --> 32:06.707
She created a space for me
to do what I wanted to do,

32:06.707 --> 32:09.362
drugs to facilitate.

32:09.362 --> 32:12.539
At first, it was...

32:12.539 --> 32:15.107
wonderful.

32:15.107 --> 32:19.198
But I needed more,
and I always needed more.

32:21.809 --> 32:24.246
After a while,

32:24.246 --> 32:28.598
I didn't just have
a compulsion.

32:28.598 --> 32:31.471
It had me.

32:33.168 --> 32:35.605
That's a good story.

32:35.605 --> 32:37.172
Rather, sadly, all true.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.829
And we will be talking
to Ms. Hess.

32:41.829 --> 32:43.396
And my client?

32:43.396 --> 32:45.137
We get confirmation that
she was, in fact,

32:45.137 --> 32:47.052
behind those parties,
I'll talk to the DA.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.097
In the meantime, your client
is going to get arraigned

32:49.097 --> 32:51.491
for sexual assault
and attempted murder.

32:54.755 --> 32:55.930
Ethan.

33:00.152 --> 33:03.459
One last question, just for me.

33:03.459 --> 33:04.504
Of course.

33:06.332 --> 33:09.335
What could possibly be
so pleasurable for you

33:09.335 --> 33:11.990
to choke a woman
until she's dead?

33:16.124 --> 33:17.430
You really want to know?

33:20.085 --> 33:22.217
It's the vibration.

33:24.437 --> 33:27.483
It has a quasi ritenente
all its own.

33:41.628 --> 33:43.847
Move through and
search the entire floor.

33:43.847 --> 33:45.632
Copy that.

33:45.632 --> 33:48.461
Search warrant
for my office and my home.

33:48.461 --> 33:49.897
You're not gonna find anything.

33:49.897 --> 33:51.246
Well, we know that
you're filming these parties.

33:51.246 --> 33:52.595
The question is why.

33:53.901 --> 33:56.425
All your years
investigating sex crimes,

33:56.425 --> 33:58.862
you should know better
than anyone, Captain.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.737
Tell me, what do
the perpetrators

34:03.737 --> 34:07.523
of all the most savage things
in the world have in common?

34:10.091 --> 34:13.007
You can't tell me
that you don't see it.

34:13.007 --> 34:14.704
Enlighten me.

34:16.184 --> 34:19.274
If men disappeared tomorrow,

34:19.274 --> 34:22.582
so would war and rape

34:22.582 --> 34:25.802
and just about every other ill
of mankind.

34:25.802 --> 34:27.891
Wow.
That is a bold statement.

34:29.719 --> 34:32.809
I--I almost feel sorry for you.

34:35.334 --> 34:39.468
But I'm raising a son
who is good

34:39.468 --> 34:42.341
and who is kind

34:42.341 --> 34:44.908
and who is thoughtful.

34:44.908 --> 34:46.693
I'm sure he is.

34:46.693 --> 34:49.522
But I'm guessing by
the lack of a ring,

34:49.522 --> 34:51.785
that there's no male example
in the picture.

34:51.785 --> 34:56.964
So all of this
is to get back at men,

34:56.964 --> 34:58.661
to set them up,

34:58.661 --> 35:01.316
to blackmail them,
for all the harm

35:01.316 --> 35:02.752
that they've done to the world?

35:02.752 --> 35:05.538
I don't make them
light the fire.

35:05.538 --> 35:09.542
I simply give them
a little tinder.

35:09.542 --> 35:11.544
They put the match
to it every time.

35:11.544 --> 35:14.155
And victims like Maggie
get burned.

35:14.155 --> 35:16.288
Better in my brownstone
than on the street,

35:16.288 --> 35:17.332
wouldn't you agree, Captain?

35:17.332 --> 35:18.551
Better for who?

35:18.551 --> 35:21.380
Better for the world?

35:21.380 --> 35:24.034
Or better for your portfolio?

35:24.034 --> 35:25.123
Why not both?

35:25.123 --> 35:26.907
Turn around.
You're under arrest.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.087
Captain, we found something.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.177
Hey.

35:36.177 --> 35:38.092
40, 50 hard drives,
maybe more.

35:38.092 --> 35:40.225
Enough for a couple dozen
high profile cases.

35:40.225 --> 35:43.489
Well, I gotta hand it to her.
She got what she wanted.

35:43.489 --> 35:45.360
That pair of bracelets
you promised?

35:45.360 --> 35:47.536
No.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.930
The potential to take down
half of the most

35:49.930 --> 35:52.672
powerful men in New York City.

36:00.723 --> 36:02.421
It's gonna take weeks
for TARU

36:02.421 --> 36:04.205
to go through all
of Lena's footage.

36:04.205 --> 36:06.251
Oh, let's just hope that the
only thing criminal on them

36:06.251 --> 36:08.078
is Maggie's assault.
- I wouldn't be too hopeful.

36:08.078 --> 36:10.429
The optimist in me
says that you're wrong.

36:10.429 --> 36:12.082
And the cynic?

36:12.082 --> 36:14.433
There's a reason that
Lena kept those tapes.

36:14.433 --> 36:15.825
Yeah.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.087
You know, what is Lena's deal?

36:17.087 --> 36:18.872
There's a ton of powerful
women in New York.

36:18.872 --> 36:20.047
She doesn't want to blackmail
any of them.

36:20.047 --> 36:22.441
My take is that
she's been victimized

36:22.441 --> 36:24.791
sometime in the past.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.749
Explains her crusade
against men.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.144
Is she wrong?

36:30.144 --> 36:31.580
It sounds like respect.

36:31.580 --> 36:34.540
Well, this job, what
percentage of perps are men?

36:34.540 --> 36:36.846
All of them.
I mean, most of the time.

36:36.846 --> 36:38.326
Yeah.

36:38.326 --> 36:41.242
It sounds like there's a flaw
in the general design.

36:41.242 --> 36:42.939
I'm just glad
I'm raising daughters.

36:42.939 --> 36:45.333
Thanks.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.030
Noah will be fine.

36:49.076 --> 36:52.558
I wish I could say the same
about the world.

36:52.558 --> 36:54.255
This job will do that to you.

36:56.039 --> 36:58.694
Hey, how's the fight going
with that monster?

36:58.694 --> 37:00.566
I'm in a good place.

37:00.566 --> 37:02.089
I'm figuring things out.

37:02.089 --> 37:04.439
Whatever you're doing,

37:04.439 --> 37:06.006
keep doing that.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.103
<i>On the charges of
criminal sexual act</i>

37:16.103 --> 37:18.018
in the first,
unlawful surveillance,

37:18.018 --> 37:19.846
and grand larceny,
how do you plead?

37:19.846 --> 37:21.282
Not guilty, Your Honor.

37:21.282 --> 37:22.327
People on bail?

37:22.327 --> 37:23.893
Ms. Hess is a flight risk.

37:23.893 --> 37:26.809
She has considerable means
and established relationships

37:26.809 --> 37:28.202
with influential
foreign nationals.

37:28.202 --> 37:29.508
We request remand.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.161
The people have
vastly overestimated

37:31.161 --> 37:32.293
my client's wealth.

37:32.293 --> 37:34.077
Because it's
in offshore accounts.

37:34.077 --> 37:35.862
She has no record and is
a well-respected member

37:35.862 --> 37:37.516
member of her community.

37:37.516 --> 37:40.214
I'm granting ROR,
on condition

37:40.214 --> 37:42.042
that the defendant
wear an ankle monitor

37:42.042 --> 37:44.784
and remain under house arrest
pending trial.

37:50.355 --> 37:52.182
She doesn't seem worried
about anything.

37:52.182 --> 37:54.489
Yeah, well, she might
have something on the judge.

37:54.489 --> 37:55.621
Who knows who else?

37:55.621 --> 37:57.100
TARU's going
through the tapes.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.277
If there is something,
they'll find it before trial.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.673
So Lena Hess was
behind these parties.

38:04.673 --> 38:07.720
So much for your company's
big sale.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.374
Money doesn't matter
to me anymore.

38:09.374 --> 38:11.201
I'm just happy I'm alive.

38:11.201 --> 38:14.944
I am never going back
into that office again.

38:14.944 --> 38:16.468
Yeah.

38:16.468 --> 38:18.818
Ethan made a deal with the DA,

38:18.818 --> 38:22.474
but he will do
serious prison time.

38:22.474 --> 38:24.258
And the best part
of all of this

38:24.258 --> 38:27.870
is that you will
not have to testify.

38:27.870 --> 38:31.744
I can just go
on with my life.

38:31.744 --> 38:34.312
The question is,

38:34.312 --> 38:36.662
what will you do with it?

38:36.662 --> 38:40.274
I want to finally
have that surgery

38:40.274 --> 38:42.581
for my scar tissue.

38:42.581 --> 38:46.193
It sounds like
a really good plan.

38:46.193 --> 38:50.502
And when you're
through all of that,

38:50.502 --> 38:53.592
I hope that you'll come back

38:53.592 --> 38:55.768
and let us offer you
the resources

38:55.768 --> 38:57.552
that we have
for healing trauma.

38:57.552 --> 39:01.251
Yeah, I don't really want
to speak with a therapist.

39:05.734 --> 39:08.824
I want to see the surveillance
footage of my attack.

39:08.824 --> 39:10.739
Listen, Maggie, I'm
not sure that that's

39:10.739 --> 39:12.045
the best thing for you.

39:12.045 --> 39:14.134
Yeah, but it happened to me.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.790
So shouldn't I have a right
to try to make sense

39:17.790 --> 39:21.315
of this in my own way?

39:21.315 --> 39:24.797
Captain, sorry to interrupt.
We have a problem.

39:24.797 --> 39:26.625
You've got to be kidding me.

39:26.625 --> 39:27.974
We lost her?

39:27.974 --> 39:29.758
Monitor signal went out
for two hours.

39:29.758 --> 39:32.108
No signs of tampering.
Lock still sealed tight.

39:32.108 --> 39:33.719
She just slipped it
off her ankle?

39:33.719 --> 39:35.416
Driver found it
in the back seat.

39:37.723 --> 39:40.029
Hey, is--is that the woman
you were driving?

39:40.029 --> 39:41.857
- Yeah, that's her.
- What happened?

39:41.857 --> 39:42.815
Nothing happened.

39:42.815 --> 39:44.033
I picked her up.

39:44.033 --> 39:45.644
I drove her
to Teterboro Airport.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.950
As soon as I found that ankle
bracelet, I called the cops.

39:47.950 --> 39:49.517
All right, track the flight
and start working up

39:49.517 --> 39:51.084
an extradition order.

39:51.084 --> 39:53.173
We really do live
in a tiered justice system.

39:53.173 --> 39:55.001
Yeah, and Lena's
got a penthouse view.

39:55.001 --> 39:57.395
Uni found this in the car.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.353
What is this?

40:10.103 --> 40:13.367
Captain Benson,
you got my thank you note

40:13.367 --> 40:15.848
for the bracelets
you were so kind to give me.

40:15.848 --> 40:17.545
Where are you?

40:17.545 --> 40:19.286
<i>On my way to Brussels.</i>

40:19.286 --> 40:21.070
Or is it Dubai?

40:21.070 --> 40:23.290
Either one is so beautiful
this time of year.

40:23.290 --> 40:24.944
You trying
to make me jealous,

40:24.944 --> 40:27.642
or is there something
that I can do for you?

40:27.642 --> 40:29.383
You have my footage.

40:29.383 --> 40:31.472
A woman like you
could do a lot with that.

40:31.472 --> 40:35.476
You have no idea
what kind of woman I am.

40:35.476 --> 40:37.739
Don't play with fire.

40:37.739 --> 40:40.220
Well, that's no fun, Captain.

40:44.224 --> 40:45.138
What was that?

40:46.748 --> 40:48.358
Wrong number.
