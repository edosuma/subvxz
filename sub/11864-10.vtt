01:21.081 --> 01:25.541
A lot of people
seem to have some kind of internal "to do" list.

01:25.669 --> 01:29.120
They have this compelling need
to get things done.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.331
But it's hard.

01:32.801 --> 01:38.921
When you finish one thing, it's time
to move on to the next item on the list.

01:39.057 --> 01:41.762
The list never quite gets done.

01:41.893 --> 01:45.511
We're forever in a state of unfinishedness.

01:45.647 --> 01:50.523
Then you'll do the same for the section
on filers, clerks, executive assistants

01:50.652 --> 01:54.103
and when the new policy manuals
are all collated

01:54.239 --> 01:57.405
then I'll show you
how to use the Bindomatic.

01:57.534 --> 02:01.234
We now save mucho dinero
by binding them in-house.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.704
- Do you have sticky fingers?
- I'm pretty sure I don't.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.497
You should.
They're your best friend for a job like this.

02:08.627 --> 02:12.792
- Lucky for you I have another pair.
- Lucky for me.

02:12.924 --> 02:16.969
Mm. No, silly! Where is thumbkin?

02:21.474 --> 02:23.550
Oh. I envy you.

02:23.685 --> 02:27.433
Collating is so Zen, so meditative.

02:27.564 --> 02:32.806
The rhythmic nature of repetition
frees the mind to think deep thoughts.

02:32.944 --> 02:36.360
It's like sweeping. Whoosh.
Do you know where I'm coming from?

02:36.489 --> 02:37.521
Jupiter?

02:37.657 --> 02:39.365
I do.

02:39.492 --> 02:43.656
You'll be amazed to discover
how much your busy bee hands accomplish.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.955
- Bees don't have hands.
- No, they don't.

02:48.084 --> 02:53.755
But you know who does? You do.
And you know what they say about idle hands?

02:53.882 --> 02:57.298
They'll strangle the person
who asked them to collate?

02:57.427 --> 03:02.089
Well, I'll leave you to it, Ms Busy Bee.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.726
With days of collating ahead of me,

03:05.852 --> 03:10.313
Delores' Zen theory just
might be the way to get through it.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.109
Wax on... wax off...

03:13.234 --> 03:14.942
Ow!

03:15.945 --> 03:17.819
Fuck me.

03:17.947 --> 03:21.281
Good thing reapers heal quickly.

03:21.409 --> 03:23.900
I knew there was something else. More luck.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.658
Because you now exceed
25 hours per week,

03:26.790 --> 03:29.993
you qualify
for our health and pension benefits.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.035
Just a nick in the take-home.

03:32.170 --> 03:36.499
VICA, federal, state, Medicare,

03:36.633 --> 03:40.583
vision, dental, mental
and Indian Casino tax!

03:42.555 --> 03:44.844
Who knows what that's about?

03:47.602 --> 03:50.971
Most people don't even qualify
for health benefits.

03:51.106 --> 03:54.771
Having no money
didn't sound like a benefit.

03:54.901 --> 03:55.932
Lucky me!

03:56.069 --> 03:59.604
Johnny Vegas omelette, rare,
Jane's addiction,

03:59.739 --> 04:05.575
home fries, burnt, gooseberry flapjack,
side of sausage and toast.

04:06.663 --> 04:10.910
Working on empty today?
They've perfected the Johnny Vegas.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.992
I have no money. Does anyone care?

04:15.130 --> 04:17.880
I do, darling. Have a sausage patty.

04:18.925 --> 04:22.674
Good morning. One for you...

04:22.804 --> 04:26.173
One for you. One for each of you.

04:26.307 --> 04:29.012
Chock-full full of helium and love.

04:29.144 --> 04:32.061
- What's the occasion?
- She had sex with a carny?

04:32.188 --> 04:35.853
Why do I need to have an occasion
to spread love?

04:35.984 --> 04:40.231
Because you're an ornery bitch
and you eat puppy dogs for breakfast.

04:40.363 --> 04:46.069
Oh, stop. I'm just in a good mood.
How is everybody this fine morning?

04:46.202 --> 04:49.488
She's got the grin of a lady on Vicodin.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.327
Have you got some spare?

04:52.459 --> 04:55.246
This is not about drugs or sex.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.501
I just feel giving.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.038
Is it too early for souvlaki?

05:00.175 --> 05:04.042
- How about buying a dead girl breakfast?
- Sure, babe. Anything you want.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.431
- No Post-it for me?
- You have two days off.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.393
- Why does she get two days off?
- Why does she get two days off?

05:11.519 --> 05:15.102
- I'm OK, Rube.
- Daisy will take over for you.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.272
Take over for her?

05:19.652 --> 05:24.943
No, and no means no! Powerful, isn't it?
I learnt it doing a PSA about date rape.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.609
I'm your boss and you'll do as I say.
Equally powerful.

05:29.871 --> 05:33.916
It's nothing short of obscene
to think that I, Daisy Adair,

05:34.042 --> 05:37.493
would do double time
for a woman who wears that...

05:37.629 --> 05:41.329
.. dreadful little hat
and orthopaedic shoes.

05:45.553 --> 05:49.598
A trip to the Point Grey Club
does soften the blow.

05:49.724 --> 05:53.639
Rox? Talk to you later?

05:58.400 --> 06:01.235
Do I still get breakfast?

06:05.949 --> 06:09.781
- Can I help you?
- Yes. I believe my party may be seated.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.739
- Which party is that?
- Hourihan.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.282
- Mr or Mrs?
- Whichever one is here.

06:17.419 --> 06:21.748
Yes. Mr Hourihan dines
at the Boston Club on Tuesdays.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.630
But his mother... she's just over there.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.334
Many thanks.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.428
We'll have that dessert now.

06:34.936 --> 06:40.690
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
That scarf is just beautiful. Where did you get it?

06:40.817 --> 06:45.775
It was a gift. My husband
bought it for me in San Francisco.

06:45.905 --> 06:49.440
- So flattering.
- As are you. What's your name, dear?

06:49.576 --> 06:52.149
- Daisy Adair.
- Do we know any Adairs?

06:52.287 --> 06:56.700
Sean Adair. But I don't think you're related,
you're too fresh and lovely.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.534
He's a little oily.
Lebanese, I think. Anyway...

07:00.670 --> 07:03.505
- Where were you raised?
- I'm a Greenwich Adair.

07:03.631 --> 07:07.131
- Greenwich, Connecticut?
- Is there any other?

07:08.845 --> 07:13.756
I'm Joyce.
This is Sylvia, Jane and Mary-Kate.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.347
So nice to meet you all.

07:19.022 --> 07:22.355
Bananas Foster, my favourite!

07:22.484 --> 07:26.351
Joyce is turning 30...
for the 31st year in a row.

07:26.488 --> 07:32.692
- Are you married, Daisy? I have a son.
- I'm single, but I'm not really in the market.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.947
Are you a lesbian?
Sylvia has a daughter.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.867
- Ooh!
- How exciting.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.624
This dessert is so evil.

07:43.755 --> 07:48.832
- 8,000 calories a bite.
- Please. It's not going to kill you.

07:48.968 --> 07:51.756
I believe your friend
is choking on a cookie.

07:51.888 --> 07:54.759
- Oh, my gosh!
- Somebody?

07:54.891 --> 07:56.967
Somebody help her, please.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.400
Shit. Mary-Kate's on fire.

08:11.825 --> 08:15.490
Oh. My coffee was Irish.

08:17.539 --> 08:20.290
I was supposed
to pick up that lunch check.

08:20.417 --> 08:23.620
The restaurant was kind enough
to pick up the tab.

08:23.753 --> 08:28.462
I don't want to hurry you,
but there's a limousine waiting for you.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.750
- To go where?
- To your destination.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.970
- Which is where?
- I'm not privy to that information.

08:34.097 --> 08:39.008
You're just useless. Tell your driver
to go on without me. Take care, Daisy.

08:39.144 --> 08:43.852
- Where do you think you're going?
- To my son's office. I have business.

08:43.982 --> 08:47.398
I'm guessing that your limo
won't take me there.

08:47.527 --> 08:52.355
Be a dear and tip the bus boy,
the one who tried to put me out.

08:57.162 --> 09:00.910
It was time
to seek out personal career advice.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.792
Although collating was another dream realised,

09:03.918 --> 09:06.872
I was advised to "never settle".

09:14.763 --> 09:20.635
My choices were limited to coal mining
or hand-washing J-Lo's undies.

09:21.603 --> 09:25.814
So I'm thinking,
how bad could West Virginia be?

09:25.940 --> 09:28.229
Georgia! Oh, Georgia!

09:28.360 --> 09:30.269
Oh, please, God, no.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.403
Oh, Georgia?

09:33.531 --> 09:35.773
Honey, come out, wherever you are.

09:37.786 --> 09:38.948
Georgia.

09:39.079 --> 09:43.657
It's times like these I wish
reapers had some kind of super power.

09:43.792 --> 09:46.793
You know, like I could fly or disappear or...

09:46.920 --> 09:48.544
Georgia!

09:48.672 --> 09:50.878
Or paralyse someone's vocal chords.

09:51.007 --> 09:55.420
- Fucking Daisy!
- I'm looking for a girl. Ye big, pretty.

09:55.553 --> 10:00.132
Angry. Pretty angry.
Oh, that's her. So nice visiting with you.

10:05.355 --> 10:09.768
Quiet. Why are you here?
You can't be here. I don't want you here!

10:09.901 --> 10:13.815
Georgia, Mary-Kate. Mary-Kate, Georgia.

10:13.947 --> 10:18.075
Look at this horrible place.
Is this a sweatshop?

10:18.201 --> 10:23.492
Would you explore over there
while I have a tête-à-tête with my friend?

10:23.623 --> 10:26.458
- You do that.
- What do you want?

10:26.584 --> 10:28.624
- I come bearing gifts.
- I'm busy.

10:28.753 --> 10:33.629
She's rich, which makes her son rich,
which could make us rich, but I need your help.

10:33.758 --> 10:36.084
Why would I wanna help you?

10:36.219 --> 10:41.842
The kindness of your heart and,
at the risk of repeating myself, lots of money.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.596
- How much money?
- Oodles.

10:44.728 --> 10:48.512
Do you know how many zeros
there are in oodles?

10:48.648 --> 10:51.400
Do I need to draw you a treasure map?

10:51.526 --> 10:56.769
A girl's got needs, you know.
Even a dead girl. Especially a dead girl.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.525
- What do I have to do?
- First, take a few days off.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.151
- Today?
- No. Don't be silly.

11:03.288 --> 11:06.123
How's a week next Tuesday?
Are you free?

11:06.249 --> 11:10.496
Yes, of course today! Don't you
see my face? I'm playing urgency!

11:12.672 --> 11:15.128
I'm gonna have to pass.

11:15.258 --> 11:19.042
I don't think reapers
are supposed to use ghosts to get money.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.429
- I should stay here and collate.
- Collate?

11:24.559 --> 11:28.604
Show some ambition.
That's what separates us from the animals.

11:28.730 --> 11:33.724
It's not the opposable thumb, it's ambition.
Animals don't like money, we do!

11:42.577 --> 11:45.946
Miss? Miss! Hold on, I'm coming!

11:46.081 --> 11:49.580
Oh, for the love of Mike! Jiminy Cricket!

11:51.127 --> 11:55.505
- Why can't you ever give me a break?
- You're taking it personally, sir.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.301
- It's not personal.
- How about you tear it up?

11:58.426 --> 12:02.424
- I wrote it already. It's done.
- I was just gonna move it.

12:02.555 --> 12:06.767
You were not gonna move it!
I see this vehicle every day.

12:06.893 --> 12:11.935
You were just hoping you weren't getting a ticket
today. But you are getting a ticket.

12:12.065 --> 12:16.561
Well, maybe today's different.
Maybe today you'll tear up that ticket.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.657
Maybe today is different.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.872
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you so much.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.914
I'm sure there's gonna be
some karmic reward for you.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.999
I doubt it. And you're welcome.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.768
Oh, hello.

12:56.901 --> 13:00.602
- Guess I went on a little mind vacation.
- Someone have a baby?

13:00.739 --> 13:04.523
I don't know.
Bootees are the only things I can knit.

13:04.659 --> 13:08.953
Oh, my! Have you been crying?

13:16.504 --> 13:20.004
- My Aunt Ruth died.
- Oh, Millie!

13:20.133 --> 13:23.502
I'm gonna have to take some time off.

13:23.636 --> 13:27.681
For the funeral. Five days ought to do it.

13:27.807 --> 13:32.849
One perk of two mind-numbing days
collating the policy manual

13:32.979 --> 13:35.517
was knowing the policy on bereavement.

13:35.648 --> 13:41.603
You're entitled to five bereavement days
if it's a parent, grandparent or sibling.

13:41.738 --> 13:44.988
You said it was your aunt?

13:45.116 --> 13:47.405
She practically raised me.

13:47.535 --> 13:52.114
I loved her like a sister
or a mother or a grandmother.

13:52.248 --> 13:57.456
Even so, the death of an aunt or uncle
entitles you to three bereavement days.

13:57.587 --> 14:00.623
I can't believe I fucked that up.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.963
But the funeral's out of town

14:03.093 --> 14:06.047
and with travel and all,

14:06.179 --> 14:11.933
it hardly seems like I'll be able to spend
any quality mourning time with my family.

14:17.440 --> 14:22.067
How about we say that
it was your grandmother who died?

14:24.489 --> 14:27.525
Delores, can we do that?

14:27.659 --> 14:30.328
I don't want to abuse the rules here.

14:33.039 --> 14:36.657
Don't look now,
but your grandmother just bought it.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.168
Thank you.

14:42.465 --> 14:47.590
And so it was. I not only
had to mourn the loss of my Aunt Ruth,

14:47.721 --> 14:50.472
but my precious collating job too.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.599
It was almost too much
for one person to bear.

15:00.567 --> 15:04.730
- Mary-Kate, Mason. Mason, Mary-Kate.
- Hello. Please come in.

15:07.824 --> 15:13.530
Um... So how is the whole dead thing
working out for you?

15:13.663 --> 15:18.788
The afterlife was billed as having
more amenities than I have seen thus far.

15:18.918 --> 15:23.627
I was thinking something sort of
Rive Gauche and less working class.

15:23.757 --> 15:27.457
I believe the perks kick in
after you walk into the light.

15:27.594 --> 15:32.220
There's no need to rush things.
You'll be over there soon enough.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.721
- Is this a slum?
- Suburbs.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.686
Oh. Same thing. Now get me my son.

15:37.812 --> 15:43.055
I've explained this to you. You can't just
waltz up to the living and start chatting.

15:43.193 --> 15:46.977
- Oh, I'll call him myself.
- They cannot see or hear you.

15:47.113 --> 15:51.277
There's a proper way for the dead
to communicate with the living.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.485
You have to trust me.

15:57.874 --> 16:01.623
- I need you to move out for while.
- Out of my own house?

16:01.753 --> 16:04.209
Yeah. I don't know how long I'll have her.

16:04.339 --> 16:08.716
- How am I to be compensated?
- How would you like to be compensated?

16:08.843 --> 16:12.758
50% of the takings
and 100% of your clothes off.

16:12.889 --> 16:16.388
- 10% and a handshake.
- 25% and a quick grope.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.009
Stay strong, soldier.

16:19.145 --> 16:22.561
15% and I'll let you see them
for five seconds.

16:22.691 --> 16:24.482
Done.

16:29.406 --> 16:32.110
Five, four, three, two, one.

16:37.914 --> 16:40.286
That was so worth it.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.620
What did you think of her obit?

16:45.755 --> 16:48.792
- The photo was pretty.
- What was she, 12?

16:48.925 --> 16:50.503
Oh.

16:50.635 --> 16:56.424
It was Mother's debutante photo.
She was 19... and she was beautiful.

16:57.767 --> 17:03.307
I think she's prettier today.
Look at her eyelashes. Her skin.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.441
I love that shade of red on her lips.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.355
I'd like that guy to do my make-up.

17:09.487 --> 17:13.948
A lot of people in this room
would like that guy to do your make-up.

17:16.911 --> 17:20.162
Hm. I expected a bigger crowd.

17:20.290 --> 17:22.164
A better crowd.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.661
Oh, for God's sakes,
there's my dry-cleaner.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.513
So here's the deal. You are a Davenport.

17:37.640 --> 17:41.259
Your mother's cousin,
a Lindsay, was married to a Buckingham

17:41.394 --> 17:45.309
who was nephew to
the dearly departed Mary-Kate Hourihan.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.357
- Which makes me?
- Very sad.

17:48.485 --> 17:52.529
- Now go while the grieving's good.
- Which one is her son?

17:52.655 --> 17:55.740
Matthew Hourihan.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.445
Honey.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.450
Wait. Come here.

18:03.458 --> 18:06.412
Ow! OK. Now, that hurt.

18:06.544 --> 18:09.332
OK. Great. Now you look hurt. Go.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.882
Matthew? I'm so sorry.

18:18.014 --> 18:23.601
I can't believe this. She was so... unique.

18:24.646 --> 18:28.430
- Hi.
- I'm Millie... Davenport.

18:28.566 --> 18:33.691
- I'm a Davenport.
- So that makes us second cousins?

18:33.822 --> 18:36.028
I believe it does.

18:37.784 --> 18:41.235
Poor Mary-Kate. She'll be missed.

18:41.371 --> 18:46.329
I'm sorry. I'm very upset
and it's just been a sea of faces.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.579
There is something
I have to tell you, Matthew.

18:49.713 --> 18:53.295
I wrote it down
because she insisted I write it down.

18:53.425 --> 18:58.466
The Englanders Trust documents
held by Hertzfield & Associates

18:58.596 --> 19:01.134
are not the most recent.

19:01.266 --> 19:06.770
Look in the bottom drawer
in her curio cabinet upstairs.

19:06.896 --> 19:10.562
- Who told you that?
- Uh... Mary-Kate.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.812
You know, your mother.

19:13.945 --> 19:16.614
- When?
- Last night.

19:16.740 --> 19:20.440
I'm sorry... What?

19:20.577 --> 19:25.819
Um... I was at a seance last night

19:25.957 --> 19:31.497
and I was having a conversation with my mother
which wasn't going well, as usual,

19:31.629 --> 19:37.549
and your mother unexpectedly joined in
and asked me to tell you that.

19:37.677 --> 19:42.339
Don't ask me to repeat that
because it's all Greek to me.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.051
Um...

19:45.477 --> 19:49.889
God bless you and... take care.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.225
Uh... Hold on.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.154
Oh.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.275
What a pretty woman I was.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.118
Very nice.

20:05.163 --> 20:10.158
Our beloved Mary-Kate,
we ask you to commune with us...

20:11.419 --> 20:13.495
.. and sit with us.

20:16.675 --> 20:18.751
What was that?

20:21.137 --> 20:25.301
- What are you doing?
- Making authentic scary noises with this.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.470
This isn't a seventh-grade
sleepover party.

20:28.603 --> 20:30.679
Oh, good. Look.

20:32.941 --> 20:34.518
Go plug that in.

20:34.651 --> 20:38.862
What's next? We make holes in sheets
and walk around moaning?

20:38.988 --> 20:40.566
Just plug it in.

20:40.699 --> 20:45.906
I summon you,
the spirit of Mary-Kate Hourihan.

20:46.037 --> 20:49.240
Fly to us! Fly!

20:51.292 --> 20:54.626
- I believe someone has joined us.
- Is it my mother?

20:54.754 --> 20:57.079
I don't know.

20:57.215 --> 21:02.173
I feel a very powerful presence,
but we must be sure.

21:02.303 --> 21:07.927
Mary-Kate, if you're with us,
please give us a sign.

21:17.485 --> 21:20.735
Please. Enough with the theatrics.

21:20.864 --> 21:23.699
Mary-Kate is very anxious to talk to you.

21:24.826 --> 21:29.369
- How do I know she's really here?
- You're clutching my handkerchief.

21:29.497 --> 21:34.492
Which you obviously stole from
my bedside drawer, holding it like a blanky.

21:34.627 --> 21:40.381
That handkerchief is from her nightstand.
It touches her heart that you're holding it.

21:46.973 --> 21:48.254
Oh!

21:48.391 --> 21:50.633
I miss you so much.

21:50.769 --> 21:54.766
Little dipshit.
Wet his bed till he was seven.

21:54.898 --> 21:58.148
She says she misses you very much too.

22:04.699 --> 22:06.822
Where were you this afternoon?

22:06.951 --> 22:11.281
Handing out parking tickets.
That's what I do, you know.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.822
I didn't see you on the street.

22:16.086 --> 22:19.122
Supervisor said you called in sick.

22:19.255 --> 22:24.676
Well, I'm playing a little hooky today.
Just chilling, you know.

22:24.803 --> 22:29.465
Do some shopping.
I have a "to do" list too, you know.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.852
Should have gotten the French tips.

22:33.978 --> 22:38.605
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm doing my nails.

22:38.733 --> 22:43.111
Then I'm going to Wal-Mart.
They're having a sale on bundt cake pans.

22:44.197 --> 22:48.859
I do love a delicious bundt cake.
I'll make you one if you like.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.325
Careful, sweetheart.

22:58.628 --> 23:02.246
A thousand housewives
have tried this shtick and failed.

23:03.550 --> 23:05.626
What shtick is that?

23:06.678 --> 23:08.967
Smiling, keeping busy.

23:10.056 --> 23:13.508
Trying to bullshit their way
out of an existential crisis.

23:13.643 --> 23:15.968
I'm not having a crisis, Rube.

23:17.147 --> 23:21.607
- You're mourning. It's all over you.
- What do you want me to do?

23:21.735 --> 23:25.435
Go to church, wear all black?
Say a fucking rosary?

23:25.572 --> 23:27.897
Acknowledge your grief.

23:28.033 --> 23:30.950
Everybody grieves in a different way, Rube.

23:31.077 --> 23:34.493
- I ain't gotta tell you that.
- Yours reeks of avoidance.

23:34.622 --> 23:37.742
I can't change anything about the past.

23:37.876 --> 23:41.708
I don't know why
we have to keep going over it again.

23:41.838 --> 23:44.625
I'll be waiting for you
whenever you're ready.

23:44.758 --> 23:47.296
Fucked up my manicure.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.212
Sorry.

23:52.349 --> 23:55.136
I'll still make you that bundt cake.

23:56.353 --> 24:00.813
- Lemon OK?
- I'll be home tonight.

24:12.660 --> 24:15.531
Just look at the little milksop.

24:15.663 --> 24:20.788
He's too weak to stand up to the board.
He'll never run the company without me.

24:21.711 --> 24:25.958
She says she wants you
to take over the board of directors.

24:27.509 --> 24:30.794
We could get in big trouble for this.

24:30.929 --> 24:34.179
We could get transferred
to a really awful place.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.801
I'm serious, Mason.

24:37.936 --> 24:42.977
This thing seems really stupid.
We could get screwed big time.

24:43.108 --> 24:46.227
Yeah, but we can also
get very rich big time.

24:47.946 --> 24:49.606
OK. Cool.

24:49.739 --> 24:52.610
William Garrett is his enemy.

24:52.742 --> 24:57.819
At the next meeting, Garrett will call
for a buy-back of all outstanding shares.

24:57.956 --> 25:00.281
Go on. Tell him.

25:00.417 --> 25:04.710
At the next board meeting,
this fellow Garrett...

25:07.257 --> 25:09.249
- Aagh!
- What is it?

25:11.302 --> 25:14.220
I can't continue. It's too dangerous.

25:14.347 --> 25:17.017
What's too danger...? Am I in danger?

25:17.142 --> 25:18.802
No. Me.

25:18.935 --> 25:22.933
If I channel the dead for too long,
I might die myself.

25:23.064 --> 25:26.065
- Some spirits are draining.
- I am not finished.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.399
Tell him about Garrett.

25:30.739 --> 25:33.942
I'm sorry, Matthew. She's gone.

25:34.075 --> 25:38.784
- You are fucking with the wrong ghost.
- Get her back. I need to continue.

25:38.913 --> 25:41.701
Here's the 2,000 you asked for.

25:41.833 --> 25:45.783
- We are so rich.
- She's gonna take his money.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.411
- I can't take that.
- She's fucking it up.

25:48.548 --> 25:51.335
- What's that? Mother?
- No.

25:51.468 --> 25:55.715
This house is full of spirits.
It's an occupational hazard.

25:55.847 --> 25:58.255
I can't take your money.

25:58.391 --> 26:02.471
- Look, I'll pay you 10,000.
- Rich!

26:02.604 --> 26:07.266
I don't think you realise the health risk
this could pose for me.

26:07.400 --> 26:11.232
- 20,000.
- Perhaps you have some idea.

26:11.363 --> 26:16.439
Come back tomorrow night.
I'll bring Mary-Kate if it's the last thing I do.

26:16.576 --> 26:19.245
Thank you. Thank you.

26:21.873 --> 26:26.950
You don't think I'm going to stand by
while you swindle him out of $20,000?

26:27.087 --> 26:28.629
Send for my lights.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.582
Leave any time you like,

26:30.715 --> 26:34.464
but leave now and the battle
for your business may not go well.

26:34.594 --> 26:37.215
William Garrett sounds like a bad hat.

26:37.347 --> 26:43.468
Isn't saving the company for your son
worth a measly 20 grand?

26:43.603 --> 26:47.731
You're richer than God. I'm guessing.
I have no inside information.

26:50.610 --> 26:55.521
- What's with the parlour tricks, asshole?
- You just gave up two grand.

26:56.700 --> 27:01.278
Don't look at me.
He came up with the lame ghost shit.

27:01.413 --> 27:06.834
Mason, I'm going to make this perfectly simple
so you're able to understand.

27:11.089 --> 27:13.924
We have the ghost.

27:14.968 --> 27:19.012
You only need parlour tricks
when you can't talk to the dead,

27:19.139 --> 27:21.677
you dumb fucking limey.

27:23.268 --> 27:28.309
Did you see his face when that lamp fell?
That sealed the deal.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.558
Don't you fuck this up.

27:31.693 --> 27:34.266
Don't you fuck this up!

27:36.114 --> 27:39.364
With our seance business unfinished,

27:39.659 --> 27:42.743
I was stuck with the task of baby-sitting.

27:47.459 --> 27:51.955
I've sailed my whole life.
Had my first boat when I was eight.

27:52.088 --> 27:55.125
Oh, I just loved being out there.

27:55.258 --> 27:57.714
I wish I'd been buried at sea.

27:57.844 --> 28:02.008
Couldn't you have put that in your will?
Asked someone to do it?

28:02.140 --> 28:04.429
Coulda, shoulda, didn't.

28:05.810 --> 28:09.678
We kept a boat at St Bart's.
You know St Bart's?

28:09.814 --> 28:11.973
I suppose that's an island.

28:12.108 --> 28:17.066
It is. It's a little jewel
in the French West Indies.

28:17.197 --> 28:22.322
When the planes came in, they'd use
this tiny runway that ended at the water.

28:22.452 --> 28:26.663
Terrifying. Every time we flew in,
I thought, "We're all going to die."

28:26.790 --> 28:28.747
But we never did.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.832
But she did die.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.792
Mary-Kate would never
take another vacation to St Bart's.

28:34.923 --> 28:37.496
And I'd never see it at all.

28:37.634 --> 28:40.386
- Did they speak French there?
- Mais oui.

28:40.512 --> 28:43.003
On parlait franç ais Ià-bas...

28:43.139 --> 28:46.804
.. except for the stupid Americans
who couldn't be bothered.

28:48.103 --> 28:51.222
- Do you know how to sail?
- No.

28:51.356 --> 28:55.140
Well, you should learn.
You'd look good on a sail-boat.

28:59.197 --> 29:01.949
- Two guys walk into a bar...
- What type of bar?

29:02.075 --> 29:04.364
It doesn't matter. Two guys walk...

29:04.494 --> 29:08.361
Of course it matters.
Lee Strasberg preached specifics.

29:09.749 --> 29:13.913
- So the bartender says...
- I'd like to know what kind of bar too.

29:15.880 --> 29:19.499
It's not important.
The bar's just where the joke takes place.

29:20.969 --> 29:24.219
What's important is the escalation,

29:24.347 --> 29:27.384
building up to a surprising revelation...

29:28.560 --> 29:32.427
.. resulting in some kind of a hilarity.

29:33.481 --> 29:38.392
Which you're depriving yourselves of
by these mindless interruptions.

29:40.155 --> 29:43.156
Fine. Be funny.

29:43.283 --> 29:44.907
Thank you.

29:46.411 --> 29:49.744
- Two guys walk into a bar...
- You're so short-sighted.

29:49.873 --> 29:53.158
- Short-sighted about what?
- Nothing. Just some girl.

29:53.293 --> 29:56.294
Two guys walk into a bar and what?

29:57.630 --> 29:59.837
They get a drink.

30:00.884 --> 30:02.675
The end.

30:02.802 --> 30:08.591
For you... and you.
Where's your room-mate?

30:09.976 --> 30:15.599
She's fallen in love with a diplomat
and is getting fitted for a wedding dress.

30:21.154 --> 30:24.071
I don't know. I'm her room-mate, not her mother.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.902
I'll give it to her.

30:29.996 --> 30:34.160
How are you gonna give it to her
if you have no idea where she is?

30:34.292 --> 30:37.993
Mason does. So I'll give it to Mason.

30:40.423 --> 30:44.753
I do know where she is
and I will give it to her right now.

30:44.886 --> 30:46.962
I'll come with.

30:51.017 --> 30:55.229
In grief therapy
the big buzz word is "closure".

30:55.355 --> 30:58.973
Moving on with life after a loved one dies.

30:59.109 --> 31:02.442
Supposedly
there's a super-efficient way to grieve

31:02.570 --> 31:04.859
and if you can nail that down fast,

31:04.989 --> 31:09.651
you can blow through all 12 or so steps
of mourning in less than a year.

31:10.870 --> 31:13.326
But when you're mourning yourself,

31:13.456 --> 31:15.947
closure is a little tricky.

31:18.586 --> 31:20.875
That's a nice bundt cake.

31:21.006 --> 31:23.710
I learned it when I was a kid.

31:23.842 --> 31:29.714
Ask any dead person.
The one death you never get over is your own.

31:29.848 --> 31:33.347
I thought this would
be the year I would let go.

31:33.476 --> 31:37.059
What's it been? 20 years?

31:37.605 --> 31:39.515
21.

31:41.735 --> 31:47.654
- Maybe this is your year.
- Why, Rube? Why this year?

31:47.782 --> 31:52.859
'Cause life is too short
and death is too long.

31:55.040 --> 31:57.875
And 21 is a lucky number, isn't it?

31:58.001 --> 32:00.574
Come on. Throw something in there.

32:09.429 --> 32:11.754
Jennifer Beals.

32:13.475 --> 32:17.093
- She wore them well.
- Who knows where she'd be without you.

32:17.228 --> 32:22.056
Being undead gave you
a lot of time to think about your life...

32:22.192 --> 32:24.149
and its end.

32:24.277 --> 32:29.354
Revisiting the hour of your passing,
its details.

32:29.491 --> 32:31.898
The injustice of it all.

32:36.664 --> 32:38.906
One thing everyone agrees on.

32:39.042 --> 32:43.704
Going out before you're old and creaky
is pretty much worse case scenario,

32:43.838 --> 32:46.376
but when you're young and talented...

32:47.926 --> 32:50.084
.. full of life...

32:52.931 --> 32:56.264
.. and just stumbled
onto a million dollar idea...

33:02.440 --> 33:06.023
.. getting an early checkout truly stinks.

33:11.574 --> 33:15.109
Girl, what are those fool things
you got on your legs?

33:15.245 --> 33:19.574
I cut the toes out of my socks.
Check it out.

33:20.834 --> 33:25.330
Whoa. Those things look cool.
Do you sell them?

33:37.267 --> 33:40.221
You still trying to reinvent the sock?

33:40.353 --> 33:43.971
I'm getting paid
like a high-class hooker to do it too.

33:44.107 --> 33:48.603
- I made 300 bucks this week.
- That's nice.

33:54.159 --> 33:57.195
You think
you know the killers in a house,

33:57.328 --> 34:02.667
the slick porcelain of the bath tub,
the Draino under the sink.

34:02.792 --> 34:08.213
The thing is, the death weapon's
never what you think it's gonna be.

34:33.822 --> 34:37.572
It's at least a safe bet you didn't invent it.

34:42.248 --> 34:45.000
All for a fucking legwarmer.

34:52.050 --> 34:54.126
Come on.

34:55.512 --> 34:59.177
Most of us
dance towards death unwittingly.

34:59.307 --> 35:02.142
One step here, another twirl there.

35:02.268 --> 35:06.218
We get ever closer to a finale
we don't want to see.

35:07.774 --> 35:11.024
And even though
we all get a final curtain,

35:11.152 --> 35:13.026
we don't all get closure.

35:13.154 --> 35:15.989
Some of us hang around,
rehashing the show,

35:16.116 --> 35:19.781
wishing we could go back
and get the last number right.

35:21.079 --> 35:26.749
He can blackmail Garrett.
Garrett is sleeping with his housekeeper.

35:26.876 --> 35:31.704
You can blackmail Garrett.
He's sleeping with the housekeeper.

35:31.840 --> 35:34.757
I'm sleeping with her.
You mean Garrett is too?

35:34.884 --> 35:37.422
Not Maria. With his own housekeeper.

35:37.554 --> 35:40.923
- Not Maria. Who's Garrett sleeping with?
- Letitia.

35:41.057 --> 35:45.719
Why are you sleeping with Maria?
She's not a good cleaner.

35:45.854 --> 35:49.602
Your mother just wants you
to lead a good, clean life.

35:49.733 --> 35:53.184
Would you stop paraphrasing me?
You're fired.

35:53.319 --> 35:58.776
It's time for your mother to move on.
Is there anything else you'd like to ask her?

35:58.908 --> 36:02.692
- I think I'm done.
- Oh? No thank you?

36:02.829 --> 36:09.247
We thank you, spirit of Mary-Kate,
and we invite you to go.

36:09.377 --> 36:10.955
Go.

36:11.087 --> 36:14.337
Fly, spirit, fly.

36:14.466 --> 36:18.131
Here's the money that I promised you.

36:23.892 --> 36:26.217
- Mason...
- Daisy Adair, you're under arrest.

36:26.353 --> 36:28.890
- What?
- What?

36:29.022 --> 36:30.053
Shit!

36:30.190 --> 36:33.641
- For grand larceny and extortion.
- And paraphrasing.

36:33.777 --> 36:36.481
- This is absurd.
- Where are you going?

36:36.613 --> 36:40.397
Getting the fuck out of here.
I suggest you do the same.

36:41.493 --> 36:46.700
You're a fraud.
Garrett put you up to this, didn't he?

36:46.831 --> 36:51.078
You tell that son of a bitch
that Matthew Hourihan is no pushover!

36:52.212 --> 36:54.750
He can go... fuck a duck

36:54.881 --> 36:59.294
if he thinks he's gonna take over
the company my parents built!

36:59.427 --> 37:01.965
Little Matthew finally grew some stones.

37:02.097 --> 37:05.263
Cuff her. Let's get you outta here.

37:05.392 --> 37:10.267
Daisy, tell him I love him and I'm sorry
we didn't let him play hockey as a kid.

37:10.397 --> 37:12.223
He was a beautiful skater.

37:12.357 --> 37:15.808
- He won't believe me, Mary-Kate.
- Who are you talking to?

37:15.944 --> 37:20.653
- Would you give it up already?
- Tell him, Daisy. You owe me.

37:22.367 --> 37:27.492
Your mother says she loves you
and she's sorry about the hockey.

37:27.622 --> 37:30.243
She thought you were a beautiful skater.

37:30.375 --> 37:33.826
How did you...? She loved me?

37:35.672 --> 37:38.293
Let's go, Mr Hourihan.

37:44.014 --> 37:46.587
Thanks for your help. Much appreciated.

37:49.352 --> 37:52.306
You're lucky.
Most people get taken to the...

37:54.566 --> 37:57.483
Go! Go! They're after the money! Go!

38:13.668 --> 38:16.705
- That stung. .44?
- Nah. .38.

38:16.838 --> 38:20.124
Makes a lot of noise
but it's a quicker heal.

38:20.258 --> 38:22.334
Thanks. That's considerate.

38:22.469 --> 38:26.632
You're the one who should
be getting the thanks. Thanks.

38:26.765 --> 38:31.308
I always appreciate reapers
who don't mind pitching in. Thanks, boys.

38:31.436 --> 38:35.019
Come on. We're Plague Division.
All we've got is time.

38:35.148 --> 38:39.312
- What I wouldn't give for some locusts.
- I hear you, buddy.

38:43.615 --> 38:46.188
I believe that's my ride.

38:47.243 --> 38:49.781
Am I going to St Bart's?

38:49.913 --> 38:52.582
With a short stopover at Customs.

38:54.459 --> 38:56.084
Merci.

38:57.128 --> 38:58.920
De rien.

39:30.203 --> 39:33.323
- You're an asshole.
- You're a sore loser.

39:33.456 --> 39:36.457
I should have known
you orchestrated this.

39:36.584 --> 39:40.416
I should have known you'd pull
the same stuff as in New York.

39:40.547 --> 39:46.217
- Where's my money?
- I've got zero tolerance for your cons.

39:46.344 --> 39:51.090
You will not prey
on the survivors of the souls you take.

39:51.224 --> 39:53.845
You will respect that boundary

39:53.977 --> 39:57.393
and you will treat it
with the grace that it deserves...

39:58.481 --> 40:03.060
.. or you will taste a wrath
you've only read about in your plays.

40:03.194 --> 40:06.398
- Are we clear?
- Crystal.

40:06.531 --> 40:09.022
Good.

40:09.159 --> 40:11.946
Then you're free to go.

40:12.078 --> 40:14.154
The key?

40:15.623 --> 40:19.573
Don't worry. I'll leave it right here for you.

40:21.838 --> 40:25.207
- How the fuck am I gonna get that?
- You'll figure it out.

40:25.342 --> 40:27.963
You're the amazing Daisy.

40:30.055 --> 40:31.597
Fuck me.

40:33.183 --> 40:38.058
I had escaped the wrath of Rube,
but I did have to pay a price.

40:38.188 --> 40:41.189
Entertaining Mary-Kate had its cost.

40:41.316 --> 40:43.558
There you are!

40:48.782 --> 40:51.486
I've knitted you a little gift.

40:52.452 --> 40:55.903
Thanks... A baby hat.

40:56.039 --> 41:00.167
No, silly. It's a pencil-sharpener cosy.

41:01.211 --> 41:05.707
And that's the Chinese symbol
for prosperity.

41:05.840 --> 41:11.760
That's so sweet, Delores.
I could really use one of those.

41:13.431 --> 41:17.096
- How was the funeral?
- Oh, good.

41:18.144 --> 41:22.972
It's sad... It feels good to be home.

41:23.108 --> 41:25.646
It's good to have you home.

41:25.777 --> 41:30.355
Need you to get back on that collating job.
Work all night if you have to.

41:34.202 --> 41:38.994
So we continue
to muddle through our unfinished business.

41:39.124 --> 41:43.702
Try to find ways to check things off
our "to do" list.

41:43.837 --> 41:47.834
But in that strange quest
to get through all our list,

41:47.966 --> 41:52.842
we try to resist the urge
to focus just on the past.

41:52.971 --> 41:56.422
Nobody bothers
to respect the meter any more.

41:57.475 --> 41:59.931
To say I'll never do this...

42:01.479 --> 42:03.602
.. I'll never do that...

42:06.026 --> 42:10.818
.. I'll never go to St Bart's... I'll never...

42:36.681 --> 42:41.011
But sometimes we find closure
by giving death the finger,

42:41.144 --> 42:44.928
by finding the little ways
to say, "I will,

42:45.065 --> 42:46.689
I can."
