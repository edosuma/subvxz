WEBVTT

00:01.002 --> 00:03.755
<i>Iam Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:03.881 --> 00:06.967
<i>Lady Aethelflaed has followed
her father's wishes</i>

00:07.092 --> 00:10.095
<i>and married Aethelred,
the lord of Mercia,</i>

00:10.220 --> 00:14.725
<i>bringing King Alfredk dream
of an England ever closer.</i>

00:14.850 --> 00:17.311
Lord, love should be gentle and kind.

00:18.979 --> 00:23.692
<i>In</i> a <i>happier union, Father Beocca
has married my sister, Thyra.</i>

00:23.817 --> 00:25.944
Excuse me, Lord Uhtred.
I am Osferth.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.279
You are Alfred's bastard.

00:27.404 --> 00:30.699
<i>After failing to convince me
to join them,</i>

00:30.824 --> 00:33.076
<i>the Northmen brothers,
Erik and Sigefrid,</i>

00:33.202 --> 00:35.579
<i>have taken the city of Lundene.</i>

00:35.704 --> 00:39.499
You say you are sworn, yet you
float into Daneland and back again.

00:39.625 --> 00:41.251
How am I to trust you?

00:41.376 --> 00:44.379
<i>Alfred put Aethelred
in command of his armies...</i>

00:44.504 --> 00:46.673
Tomorrow we ride.
I would like you to travel with me.

00:46.798 --> 00:47.841
To battle?

00:47.966 --> 00:50.844
<i>...and we were sent
to take back the city</i>

00:50.969 --> 00:52.596
<i>but found not</i> a <i>soul.</i>

00:52.721 --> 00:54.181
If we wish, there is a way

00:54.306 --> 00:57.142
to raise the greatest army
these shores have ever seen.

00:57.267 --> 01:01.021
Lord, it's a signal that can be seen
from a mile or more.

01:01.146 --> 01:04.983
- Thyra.
- Death is coming!

01:05.108 --> 01:09.029
- <i>The forest! The forest!</i>
- <i>UHTRED: Itk</i> a <i>trick, Iknow it.</i>

01:10.322 --> 01:13.408
<i>And I fear terrible consequences.</i>

01:13.533 --> 01:15.202
<i>Destiny is all.</i>

02:30.152 --> 02:35.741
No, no. Please God,
let this not be true.

02:36.742 --> 02:38.994
- Thyra!
- STEAPA: Lady Aethelflaed!

02:39.119 --> 02:40.495
Thyra!

02:42.581 --> 02:45.292
Thyra!

02:45.417 --> 02:49.212
- Please be alive, please be alive.
- STEAPA: Lady Aethelflaed!

02:49.338 --> 02:51.214
BEOCCA: Thyra!

02:51.340 --> 02:53.717
Thyra, please!

02:56.136 --> 02:58.764
Thyra!

02:58.889 --> 03:01.516
STEAPA: Lady Aethelflaed!

03:03.477 --> 03:07.272
- Not a single man left living.
- Nor woman.

03:08.482 --> 03:11.276
She is the daughter of King Alfred.
They would not kill her.

03:12.402 --> 03:14.321
They would not.

03:15.989 --> 03:17.949
Thyra!

03:28.960 --> 03:30.295
Please.

03:35.926 --> 03:37.886
THYRA: Beocca!

03:40.680 --> 03:44.309
- Beocca!
- Thyra!

03:45.018 --> 03:48.522
- Beocca!
- Thyra!

03:48.647 --> 03:51.858
- THYRA: Beocca!
- Thyra!

03:51.983 --> 03:53.944
Beocca!

03:55.445 --> 04:00.242
I thought you were dead
and I wanted to die! (CRIES)

04:00.367 --> 04:03.703
(CRIES)

04:04.746 --> 04:08.083
Thyra. Thyra.

04:08.959 --> 04:13.130
Thyra... where is Aethelflaed?

04:16.132 --> 04:18.802
- You will answer.
- Of course she will answer!

04:22.681 --> 04:24.558
I do not know.

04:26.435 --> 04:30.272
- Did they take her?
- We ran and...

04:31.398 --> 04:34.234
Then she was... gone.

04:37.863 --> 04:39.489
We will continue the search, lord.

04:41.324 --> 04:44.161
UHTRED:
They've taken her, they must have.

04:44.286 --> 04:47.205
Why else abandon the city,
why raid the camp?

04:47.330 --> 04:51.626
She is the daughter of the king.
They wouldn't dare.

04:55.714 --> 04:58.383
ALDHELM: We will scour
the camp and beyond!

04:58.508 --> 05:01.052
We are looking for the Lady Aethelflaed!

05:12.189 --> 05:16.735
- Where are you taking me?
- You have found your voice.

05:16.860 --> 05:20.113
- We're headed to Beamfleot.
- And then?

05:20.238 --> 05:25.952
- A ship? A cage?
- I'm still to decide.

05:26.077 --> 05:28.455
I have given up Lundene for you.

05:31.541 --> 05:34.127
Erik, how does she feel?

05:34.252 --> 05:36.922
- Warm?
- Rich.

05:37.047 --> 05:41.468
As she should.
She is our pathway to glory.

05:41.593 --> 05:43.762
(BOTH LAUGH)

05:57.108 --> 05:59.194
What will you say to Alfred?

06:00.362 --> 06:03.490
What can I tell him but the truth?

06:03.615 --> 06:08.078
He will ask why she was with you.
She should never have been there.

06:08.203 --> 06:10.247
I am aware of that.

06:12.082 --> 06:15.418
You say she insisted, begged.

06:15.544 --> 06:19.798
You're so enthralled by your bride
that you could not deny her.

06:19.923 --> 06:22.551
Make myself appear weak?

06:22.676 --> 06:27.639
It is a choice, lord,
between appearing love-sick or foolish.

06:27.764 --> 06:29.266
BEOCCA: Uhtred?

06:29.391 --> 06:31.184
Uhtred, where are you going?

06:31.309 --> 06:34.771
I'm going home to Coccham
where Alfred has asked me to remain.

06:34.896 --> 06:36.773
And where I left my wife.

06:38.525 --> 06:40.694
But the king, he may need you.

06:40.819 --> 06:45.448
The king, in his wisdom,
has all but banished him, Father Beocca.

06:46.908 --> 06:48.785
ALDHELM:
You should also raise the question

06:48.910 --> 06:53.248
of how the Northmen came to know
of Aethelflaed's situation,

06:53.373 --> 06:54.916
of where she would be.

06:55.792 --> 06:57.002
MAN: Move on.

07:15.228 --> 07:19.566
If you believe her to be alive,
you will not abandon her.

07:19.691 --> 07:20.859
You will not. That is a fact.

07:20.984 --> 07:22.944
So what is the real reason

07:23.069 --> 07:25.780
we're travelling home to Coccham
and not to Winchester?

07:25.905 --> 07:28.241
There's nothing to be said
in Winchester.

07:28.366 --> 07:30.994
I won't be part of a whispering court.

07:31.119 --> 07:34.998
We will go when I have something to say,
not before.

07:39.085 --> 07:41.129
- Sihtric.
- Lord?

07:44.007 --> 07:45.884
Take Rypere there
and go to Beamfleot.

07:46.009 --> 07:50.055
That is where Erik and Sigefrid's
fleet lie. That is where they'll be.

07:50.180 --> 07:52.057
We are to SPY?

07:52.182 --> 07:55.477
You're to confinn Lady Aethelflaed
is alive and how they're treating her.

07:55.602 --> 07:57.854
Send Rypere back to me at Coccham.

07:57.979 --> 08:00.315
You will remain there
and yes, you are to spy.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.485
Sihtric, lwill need to know
every part of Beamfleot,

08:03.610 --> 08:06.696
every blade of grass
that surrounds their fortress.

08:06.821 --> 08:08.865
Yes, lord.

08:19.125 --> 08:23.672
SIGEFRID: See this?
Warriors join us by the day.

08:23.797 --> 08:27.467
With word of your capture,
there will be more.

08:27.592 --> 08:29.803
All waiting for war.

08:29.928 --> 08:32.222
You have my thanks, lady.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.393
There will be many men inside.

08:36.518 --> 08:39.813
They will want to get close to you,
look you in the eye.

08:39.938 --> 08:43.775
- They'll want to frighten me.
- (CHUCKLES) They will.

08:49.447 --> 08:52.033
(CHEERING)

08:58.707 --> 09:00.333
(ERIK LAUGHS)

09:00.458 --> 09:02.001
(GASPS)

09:02.127 --> 09:04.212
(MAN SHOUTS)

09:08.466 --> 09:11.803
- SIGEFRID: What did I say?
- (CROWD FALLS SILENT)

09:11.928 --> 09:16.391
I told you I would invite
King Alfred's daughter,

09:16.516 --> 09:18.351
and she is here!

09:18.476 --> 09:21.146
(CHEERING)

09:21.271 --> 09:26.985
I swear to the gods that this prize

09:27.110 --> 09:29.988
will not be sold cheaply.

09:30.113 --> 09:35.702
There will be wealth and glory
for every man here!

09:35.827 --> 09:38.371
(CHEERING)

09:39.080 --> 09:40.832
Yeah!

09:55.930 --> 09:57.515
ERIK: It is the best we have.

09:58.641 --> 10:01.978
These are my own men,
they will watch you.

10:02.103 --> 10:06.691
You will have a guard at all times.
You will be safe here.

10:06.816 --> 10:11.029
And my companions?
My servants from the camp?

10:12.405 --> 10:16.409
Any woman who is not Aethelflaed
will have been killed or claimed.

10:23.208 --> 10:25.168
Claimed is most likely.

10:26.252 --> 10:28.463
There's a bucket in the corner.

10:28.588 --> 10:32.342
A royal bucket, no splinters.

10:57.784 --> 11:04.082
Aethelred, I was expecting a messenger,
and not for days.

11:05.792 --> 11:08.545
My news is too important
to trust to a messenger.

11:13.675 --> 11:18.221
- Lundene has been reclaimed.
- Oh, praise God.

11:18.346 --> 11:22.016
Not a single Northman
has been left alive in the city

11:22.141 --> 11:28.231
but... this great victory
has come at a significant cost.

11:29.357 --> 11:31.693
It is the way of battle.

11:34.028 --> 11:37.073
It concerns Aethelflaed, lord.

11:39.117 --> 11:40.743
What of her?

11:42.662 --> 11:47.208
We fear that she has been... taken.

11:49.377 --> 11:52.589
- We pray that is the outcome, lord.
- By the Northmen?

11:52.714 --> 11:56.509
- ODDA: Aethelflaed was with you?
- All the things they will do to her.

11:56.634 --> 11:57.802
She was there?

12:00.722 --> 12:05.685
- You took my daughter into battle?
- There was no battle, lord.

12:05.810 --> 12:08.605
She was not part of the attacking army,
lord, of course not.

12:08.730 --> 12:12.025
- She was a good distance away.
- But clearly not a safe distance.

12:12.150 --> 12:16.279
Admittedly, I was weak,
but she is headstrong and eager.

12:16.404 --> 12:19.866
- She asked to travel a part of the way.
- You are her husband!

12:20.450 --> 12:22.452
She makes it difficult
for me to refuse her.

12:22.577 --> 12:25.038
Is she alive? Have you seen her alive?
Answer me that.

12:25.163 --> 12:29.500
She must be alive, lord.
What reason would they have to kill her?

12:29.626 --> 12:31.210
But you do not know for certain?

12:33.755 --> 12:34.797
No.

12:37.467 --> 12:40.053
How they knew she was with us,
we do not know.

12:42.013 --> 12:45.183
Uhtred believes
they may have returned to Beamfleot.

12:45.308 --> 12:48.478
- He knows them well.
- Uhtred has returned to Coccham, lord.

12:48.603 --> 12:51.147
He was following
your earlier instructions, lord.

12:58.196 --> 13:03.284
After hearing of events and...
excuses...

13:05.203 --> 13:07.080
what I now require are facts.

13:08.039 --> 13:09.707
I have men across the land.

13:09.832 --> 13:14.545
I will send word and ask for word.
That is all I can do.

13:18.341 --> 13:21.427
That is all we can do. My dear.

13:22.887 --> 13:26.683
Lord, you have my word!
I shall recover her.

13:30.645 --> 13:32.063
Do you know what you've done?

13:33.606 --> 13:38.069
Possibly not, as you are
as useless as you are arrogant.

13:39.195 --> 13:41.364
I have done nothing
but carry out the king's orders.

13:41.489 --> 13:45.451
You have put at risk
the entire kingdom.

13:45.576 --> 13:47.578
All kingdoms!

13:48.871 --> 13:51.416
You're a toad. A fool.

13:51.541 --> 13:54.544
An idiot with ambition
far above your capability.

13:54.669 --> 13:56.671
And if I can see this,
be sure Alfred can see it.

13:56.796 --> 13:59.215
You have made your position clear,
Lord Odda.

13:59.340 --> 14:02.385
- We will forgive your insolence.
- You will forgive me?

14:02.510 --> 14:04.679
You will not address my lord
in that manner.

14:05.763 --> 14:10.101
May I suggest that you take a wander
for yet another cup of wine?

14:14.897 --> 14:17.150
Father Beocca, Steapa,
come with me.

14:17.275 --> 14:20.653
You will tell me every detail
from the moment you left Winchester.

14:20.778 --> 14:23.698
- With me!
- Yes, lord.

14:28.494 --> 14:30.038
"Lundene has been reclaimed

14:30.163 --> 14:34.208
and not a single Northman
has been left alive in the city."

14:35.835 --> 14:38.212
You began so well.

14:38.337 --> 14:42.425
I will be reminding the king
who it was who travelled into Daneland.

14:42.550 --> 14:43.718
I will be reminding the king

14:43.843 --> 14:48.473
that your friend Uhtred
has been called king of Mercia

14:48.598 --> 14:52.143
and I shall remind him
how fond you are of his seat.

14:54.687 --> 14:56.147
Do that.

14:57.523 --> 15:00.234
But allow me to remind you of this.

15:00.359 --> 15:04.530
The only man capable
of cleaning up this puddle of shit

15:04.655 --> 15:07.492
is the man you are desperate to blame.

15:08.284 --> 15:12.914
Uhtred, king of Mercia.

15:29.263 --> 15:31.099
What is on your mind?

15:34.102 --> 15:36.521
I am thinking of Aethelflaed.

15:37.480 --> 15:41.025
If she lives, you will be her hope.

15:45.822 --> 15:47.824
Alfred is her father.

15:49.659 --> 15:54.080
You will be her hope,
Uhtred of Bebbenberg.

15:55.623 --> 16:00.878
It should not be for you to resolve,
but you will do it.

16:01.003 --> 16:04.090
By sending Sihtric,
you have already begun.

16:04.215 --> 16:07.927
- Stay with me.
- (LAUGHS) No, I am hungry.

16:09.679 --> 16:13.349
- I will help you.
- No, I'm doing it!

16:13.474 --> 16:16.769
I think I have something.
Supper at last!

16:16.894 --> 16:18.938
(CHUCKLES) He's a sea monster.

16:23.901 --> 16:26.696
Lord. You said I should find you.

16:26.821 --> 16:30.324
- Who are you?
- He's Alfred's bastard.

16:32.952 --> 16:37.874
I am called Osferth, lady.
I am simply called Osferth.

16:44.547 --> 16:47.592
Every person in every town
has been instructed to pray

16:47.717 --> 16:49.927
that she is alive and kept well.

16:50.052 --> 16:53.723
Then she will surely be alive,
kept well, and will be free in no time.

16:53.848 --> 16:55.933
Alright, say goodnight.

16:56.809 --> 17:00.438
- You do not believe, lord?
- Oh, I believe.

17:00.563 --> 17:03.900
- (LAUGHS)
- But in the true gods.

17:05.318 --> 17:06.527
And in fate.

17:08.988 --> 17:13.117
- You wish to serve a heathen, Osferth?
- God is in all good men, lady.

17:13.242 --> 17:17.622
And my Uncle Leofric told me often
that your husband is a good man.

17:19.165 --> 17:22.710
- A great man.
- He said that?

17:23.669 --> 17:25.003
Yes, he did, lord.

17:26.380 --> 17:31.844
And yet this good man here will let you
join him for one reason only.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.640
To embarrass Alfred.

17:39.352 --> 17:41.270
It's true.

17:43.231 --> 17:46.525
That may be the reason
you allow me to join you, lord,

17:46.651 --> 17:48.819
but I will give you reason
to let me stay.

17:52.365 --> 17:54.659
You have been brought here by fate,
Osferth.

17:54.784 --> 17:57.370
If all they have in Winchester
is prayer,

17:57.495 --> 18:00.873
then they will need something more.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.668
- We will go to Winchester.
- We will not.

18:03.793 --> 18:07.838
This is what you want to do,
so why be childish about it?

18:07.964 --> 18:13.844
We will go when I have news.
From Beamfleot.

18:35.283 --> 18:36.742
(DOOR OPENS)

18:40.663 --> 18:43.624
My men tell me you are refusing to eat.

18:44.292 --> 18:49.630
- I am. I would like to wash.
- You have a bowl, you have water.

18:49.755 --> 18:53.634
I would like to bathe.
I would like to breathe cool air.

18:53.759 --> 18:55.344
I am beginning to feel sickly.

18:55.469 --> 18:59.807
My brother suggested you bathe
inside a barrel in full view of all men.

19:23.289 --> 19:24.582
<i>LadY-</i>

19:27.668 --> 19:30.796
I will arrange
for you to bathe with privacy.

19:32.089 --> 19:35.760
But in return
you must eat the food we provide.

19:39.930 --> 19:41.223
Very well.

19:44.393 --> 19:46.062
Agreed.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.941
Thank you.

20:11.504 --> 20:16.050
I feel she is alive, in my heart.

20:16.967 --> 20:19.095
But what might they do to her?

20:30.106 --> 20:32.566
She has her mother's courage

20:32.691 --> 20:37.071
and that is the very reason
that she will survive this ordeal.

20:42.701 --> 20:44.745
Lord King.

20:44.870 --> 20:50.626
Although lwould usually prefer him
miles away at Coccham,

20:50.751 --> 20:56.132
would it now be appropriate
to recall Uhtred to Winchester?

20:56.257 --> 20:59.301
- I accept he will never know God...
-lcannot

20:59.427 --> 21:02.471
But if you sent him to Beamfleot,
if she saw him...

21:02.596 --> 21:04.974
- You know I cannot.
- ...perhaps her spirits would rise.

21:05.099 --> 21:10.604
- She believes in him.
- Our belief is in God. In prayer.

21:15.860 --> 21:17.528
It is.

21:21.907 --> 21:24.410
I will leave you to your letters.

21:51.312 --> 21:56.942
We have our proof, Rypere.
You will go to Uhtred. Now.

22:07.661 --> 22:11.832
Why so many guards?
Are you afraid of me?

22:11.957 --> 22:16.128
You're a prize, lady.
Even when unwashed.

22:36.273 --> 22:39.818
She's the daughter of a king.
You will all turn away.

22:39.944 --> 22:44.448
- Show her the backs of your heads.
- Lord, where is the harm in looking?

22:44.573 --> 22:46.575
The back of your heads!

23:22.820 --> 23:24.780
HAESTEN: You were right, lord

23:27.366 --> 23:29.493
- She has beauty.
- She does.

23:29.618 --> 23:33.998
More than that, she's worth ten times
her weight in gold and silver.

23:35.416 --> 23:37.501
I'm thinking we should fatten her.

23:54.476 --> 23:56.437
(CHUCKLES)

23:56.562 --> 24:00.608
- Does this game have a name?
- Stones.

CLAPA: It's Rypere.

24:09.158 --> 24:12.328
FINAN:
He must have news from Beamfleot.

24:12.453 --> 24:14.163
I'll go and tell Uhtred.

24:14.455 --> 24:15.706
(GASPS)

24:15.831 --> 24:17.374
Uhtred!

24:17.499 --> 24:19.793
Uhtred!

24:19.918 --> 24:21.128
Uhtred?

24:37.895 --> 24:39.813
Lord, if the Northmen from Beamfleot

24:39.938 --> 24:42.024
are now raiding into Mercia
to feed their army,

24:42.149 --> 24:43.984
how long before
they come to Wessex?

24:44.109 --> 24:47.196
Is it not time
to consider raising the fyrds?

24:47.321 --> 24:51.492
Aethelwold, as you have no estate, it is
not your place to talk of raising fyrds.

24:54.203 --> 24:56.664
As for the ealdormen with estate,

24:56.789 --> 24:58.874
for each of you,
there is a harvest to be gathered.

24:58.999 --> 25:01.543
This must be done quickly
and stored within the nearest burh.

25:01.669 --> 25:02.711
It must be protected.

25:02.836 --> 25:04.630
Should they raid,
we shall not be overrun

25:04.755 --> 25:08.425
and importantly, we shall not feed them
so much as a single grain.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.303
Wessex is fortified.

25:12.012 --> 25:13.263
Once the harvest is gathered,

25:13.389 --> 25:15.766
the fighting men of the fyrds
shall be free of labor,

25:15.891 --> 25:17.393
should they be required.

25:17.518 --> 25:22.231
Should they be required, lord?
Mercia requires them now!

25:22.356 --> 25:24.400
The heathen must be dealt with!

25:24.525 --> 25:27.778
The heathen hold a hostage,
Lord Selwine.

25:27.903 --> 25:29.780
Would you have
the Lady Aethelflaed killed?

25:29.905 --> 25:33.659
Lord King,
I do not wish to cause distress,

25:33.784 --> 25:36.829
but if the lady was in fact alive,

25:36.954 --> 25:39.832
surely they would have made clear
their demands?

25:39.957 --> 25:42.918
They want us supplicant, Selwine.
They want us afraid.

25:43.043 --> 25:45.212
They do not know of our faith, lord.

25:45.337 --> 25:47.339
(DOOR OPENS)

25:51.468 --> 25:52.803
Father Pyrlig?

25:54.304 --> 25:58.642
Excuse me, lord,
but Uhtred of this parish is here.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.686
He is asking to attend.

26:03.689 --> 26:05.357
Can he be trusted?

26:06.900 --> 26:10.112
Lord, are we sure of Uhtred's position?

26:10.237 --> 26:13.407
Lord Uhtred's position
is that of an ealdorman of Wessex.

26:13.532 --> 26:15.534
Lord, it is my own view
he should be admitted.

26:15.659 --> 26:18.328
- ODDA: And mine.
- MAN: Allow him in.

26:19.079 --> 26:20.831
AELSWITH: Lord King.

26:29.214 --> 26:31.175
The Ealdorman Uhtred may join the Witan.

26:31.300 --> 26:33.093
PYRLIG: Yes, lord.

26:38.182 --> 26:39.516
Lord.

26:48.484 --> 26:49.860
Lady Aelswith.

26:52.362 --> 26:56.074
- I am here with news of Aethelflaed.
- From the Northmen?

26:56.200 --> 26:59.912
From my own spies
who sleep within the walls of Beamfleot.

27:00.037 --> 27:02.331
Lord, Aethelflaed is alive.

27:02.456 --> 27:05.250
My men have seen her
with their own eyes.

27:07.044 --> 27:09.671
- Praise Him.
- Praise Him to the heavens.

27:09.797 --> 27:12.382
SELWINE: Then why have they
not made clear their demands?

27:12.508 --> 27:15.093
They've been spreading news
of their hostage, lord.

27:15.219 --> 27:18.305
Boasting? About seizing a woman?

27:18.430 --> 27:20.724
Boasting of the army
they will raise with the ransom.

27:20.849 --> 27:22.476
This is what I fear, lord.

27:23.936 --> 27:26.563
No man in this hall
should be in any doubt.

27:26.688 --> 27:30.818
When their demands arrive,
they will be considerable.

27:30.943 --> 27:32.528
As will be the consequences.

27:32.653 --> 27:34.571
Of course
they will make outrageous demands.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.448
That is the purpose
of strong negotiation,

27:36.573 --> 27:39.076
to ensure there is agreement.

27:39.201 --> 27:45.499
- You intend to negotiate, lord?
- I intend to recover my daughter.

27:45.624 --> 27:47.960
SELWINE: Regardless of the price, lord?

27:48.085 --> 27:51.421
Mercia is not a land of plenty.
Far from it.

27:51.547 --> 27:55.133
Wessex shall pay its share of silver
and if necessary, its share of blood.

27:55.259 --> 27:56.885
I will do what needs to be done.

27:57.010 --> 27:59.304
If that means negotiation,
then lwill negotiate.

27:59.429 --> 28:02.975
UHTRED: Lord, I would advise that
you don't attend the negotiations.

28:03.100 --> 28:07.312
The presence of the king and father
would only increase their price.

28:07.437 --> 28:12.651
- But if not the king, then who?

- Yes, lord?
- It must be you.

28:29.293 --> 28:32.129
This is for Mercia to resolve.
You must go to Beamfleot.

28:34.548 --> 28:38.385
- Of course, lord.
- And a representative of Wessex, lord.

28:38.510 --> 28:43.724

to be shared between the two kingdoms.

from this journey to Beamfleot.

For my sins, God has always
placed me at your side

No, Beocca, your place
is in Winchester with Thyra.

30:21.780 --> 30:23.615
Bless you.

30:24.408 --> 30:26.076
Uhtred, you have given me so much,

30:26.201 --> 30:28.870
but giving me the courage
to approach Thyra,

30:30.288 --> 30:31.915
that was your greatest gift.

30:32.040 --> 30:37.170
- I will be in your prayers, no doubt?
- Perhaps.

Hunting is not enough.

I may go across the river,
spill a little blood.

Across the river is Wessex.

31:01.278 --> 31:06.033

that my brother is humping his daughter.

As is your habit, lord.
I have been waiting for you.

Lord, I hope you will forgive me
for what I'm about to say.

35:28.670 --> 35:32.841
My intentions are for Wessex,
for the hope of an England.

35:35.760 --> 35:40.390
You spoke of paying for Aethelflaed's
release in one of two ways.

35:40.515 --> 35:44.477
- Silver or with blood.
- I did.

35:44.602 --> 35:46.521
There is a third way.

35:47.272 --> 35:49.482
Should the ransom be too great,

35:49.607 --> 35:52.152
should the likely loss of men
be too great,

35:52.277 --> 35:57.699
should Wessex wish to emerge with
honor, lord, and greater strength...

35:59.868 --> 36:04.873
then should she not be encouraged...
to take her own life?

36:07.250 --> 36:08.918
For the good of the kingdom.

36:11.629 --> 36:15.675
Some might say it would mean martyrdom.

36:19.637 --> 36:24.267
I hear you, Odda. I'm glad you feel able
to proffer this advice.

36:25.894 --> 36:27.812
Now, I wish to sit. You will leave me.

See the sacrifice that has been made.

36:39.741 --> 36:43.078
Hundreds upon hundreds
of men, women and children

36:43.203 --> 36:46.247

for what we now have.

They have given their lives, Odda,
they did not take their lives.

And there will be reward in Heaven
for each and every soul.

36:53.838 --> 36:58.301
- That is what we believe, is it not?
- That is what I say, lord.

36:58.426 --> 37:03.264
There will be reward enough, in Heaven.

37:05.350 --> 37:08.478
You are a king before you are a father.

37:12.732 --> 37:15.026

to breathe the night's air.

Thank you.

I was born on a night of a whole moon.

My father wanted to call me Méni,
after the moon god.

38:21.217 --> 38:27.265
But Mani is chased each night
across the sky by Hati the wolf.

38:27.390 --> 38:30.643
My mother did not want me
to be chased by wolves.

38:34.147 --> 38:38.610
I saw the moon, the clear sky,
and I wanted to share it.

38:40.069 --> 38:42.864
I'm glad you thought of me.

38:42.989 --> 38:45.200
It was either share it with you
or with my brother.

38:45.325 --> 38:49.496
- (BOTH LAUGH)
- The choice was difficult, I admit.

39:03.301 --> 39:06.387
I have never seen
a face like this before.

39:09.182 --> 39:13.770
Now I see it,
even when I close my eyes.

39:17.315 --> 39:22.403
- Your husband is a fortunate man.
- My husband does not see me.

39:24.155 --> 39:26.574
Then he's blind or stupid.

39:26.699 --> 39:29.118
He is not blind.

39:33.373 --> 39:35.875
And he is not gentle, I would guess.

39:36.834 --> 39:38.628
He is the one who mistreats you?

39:41.881 --> 39:44.551
He is not the man
I would choose to be with.

You. You!

I sincerely hope so, I can barely see.

40:31.681 --> 40:34.142
At your age, it is not good for you.

40:35.602 --> 40:38.688
What is your opinion
on paying a ransom for Aethelflaed?

40:43.901 --> 40:45.653
Do you have an opinion?

40:48.323 --> 40:50.783
Not one I am prepared to say aloud.

40:51.951 --> 40:54.287
Is there much, or any,
of your father in you?

40:54.412 --> 40:59.292
- The king past?
- I'm disappointed you need to ask.

40:59.417 --> 41:04.255
I have both my father's blood
and spirit, the Danes know it.

41:04.964 --> 41:06.966
Even the dead know it.

41:08.009 --> 41:10.053
(DISTANT THUNDER)

41:10.178 --> 41:15.975
I am becoming more like him by the day.
Observe the clean tunic.

41:19.395 --> 41:21.439
He was a great man.

41:26.861 --> 41:28.905
He was my great friend.

41:30.657 --> 41:36.412
If you are indeed his son,
I may need you.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.998
You may need me for what?

41:46.381 --> 41:49.801
I believe you need your bed, lord.

41:50.593 --> 41:52.428
And a pillow.

42:08.361 --> 42:12.782
You should employ a craftsman
to fit a spoon in place of the blade.

42:13.908 --> 42:18.037
The leaves are falling. I want
the ransom paid in full by winter,

42:18.162 --> 42:19.539
an army by SPTiTIQ-

42:20.248 --> 42:23.501
A king's crown by summer.

42:23.626 --> 42:26.170
They will want the same:
answers by winter.

42:29.966 --> 42:31.426
How does she ride?

42:34.971 --> 42:39.434
Oh, you wouldn't like her,
she's bony and she squeals.

42:40.435 --> 42:42.103
She passes the time.

42:45.606 --> 42:47.442
And if you put a pup in her belly?

42:50.027 --> 42:52.280
Then Alfred will get
two for the price of one.

42:54.699 --> 42:56.200
(LAUGHS)

42:57.744 --> 43:00.455
And Viking blood to strengthen
his line, eh?

43:00.580 --> 43:02.206
(BOTH LAUGH)

43:11.883 --> 43:14.302
What will happen
when we reach Beamfleot?

43:14.427 --> 43:18.264
Will there be a ritual? A toast, a meal?

43:18.389 --> 43:20.391
There will be a heathen sacrifice.

43:20.516 --> 43:25.438
The youngest member of the visiting
party will be split with an axe.

43:25.563 --> 43:28.357
They will want to humiliate us.

43:28.483 --> 43:33.613
- In what way?
- An insult, a challenge.

43:33.738 --> 43:35.740
- Why?
- Because they can.

43:38.326 --> 43:40.119
MAN: Hey!

43:41.245 --> 43:42.330
(YELLS)

43:48.753 --> 43:52.799
Haesten. We're travelling to Beamfleot.

43:52.924 --> 43:56.844
- For Alfred?
- For Alfred, yes.

43:56.969 --> 43:59.514
I am here to take you
on to the fortress, lord.

43:59.639 --> 44:01.432
You and two others.

44:01.557 --> 44:04.352
I will travel with half my number,
no less.

44:10.066 --> 44:11.108
Agreed.

44:12.443 --> 44:14.862
AETHELRED:
The Lady Aethelflaed, she is well?

44:14.987 --> 44:17.532
There'll be no negotiation
until I have seen her.

44:17.657 --> 44:24.288
She is well. My Lord Erik sees
that she is... most content, lord.

44:27.416 --> 44:30.795
- Ride on and we'll follow.
- Oh, you will not be needing horses.

44:33.589 --> 44:35.091
(CHUCKLES)

44:48.521 --> 44:53.442
Lord, I have a question.
What is it we want from this meeting?

44:53.568 --> 44:58.698
You have to ask?
What we want is to free Aethelflaed.

44:58.823 --> 45:02.702
Yet instead,
if what transpired was war, what then?

45:03.619 --> 45:05.830
It is a question, lord, that is all.

45:07.206 --> 45:12.837
I would be without a wife, no doubt.
As that would be the cause of war.

45:13.588 --> 45:18.092
War will occur regardless,
that is certain.

45:18.217 --> 45:21.095
The only change that there can be
is the size of the army

45:21.220 --> 45:24.307
that we will face across the field.

45:24.432 --> 45:29.228
- We will be ready.
- But what is it we want?

45:29.353 --> 45:32.565
Alfred wants his daughter,
that is plain.

45:32.690 --> 45:35.192
But is that best for Mercia?

45:35.318 --> 45:40.114
Is that best for Aethelred,
lord of Mercia and Lundene

45:40.239 --> 45:43.117
and more perhaps?

45:43.242 --> 45:47.705
My advice to you, lord,
is rescue her, by all means,

45:47.830 --> 45:51.250
but not at a price
that will cut our throats.

46:23.908 --> 46:27.662
- SIGEFRID: You will all kneel.
- We will not.

46:27.787 --> 46:30.414
We have come here in peace
and as equals.

46:30.539 --> 46:33.167
You've made us walk
a good distance to meet you.

46:33.292 --> 46:34.502
That is respect enough.

46:38.297 --> 46:40.299
You should have joined me, Uhtred.

46:40.466 --> 46:44.512
If you wished me to join you,
why have a dead man tell a prophecy?

46:44.637 --> 46:49.850
- Why didn't you simply ask?
- Me, you would refuse. But the gods?

46:53.187 --> 46:55.606
The king of Wessex sends his greetings.

46:56.649 --> 46:59.276
He hopes you have enjoyed
the company of his daughter.

46:59.402 --> 47:03.406
(CHUCKLES) Enjoyed her?

47:07.076 --> 47:08.828
Oh, she's not his favorite.

47:09.787 --> 47:14.041
Why else would he have allowed her to
marry the pig's arse standing behind me?

47:14.166 --> 47:16.127
Before any negotiations take place,

47:16.252 --> 47:19.922
the pig's arse wishes to be certain
that his wife is well.

47:20.589 --> 47:24.010
And if she's not well, what then?

47:24.135 --> 47:28.180
What will the pig's arse do? Fart?

47:30.266 --> 47:31.976
(CHUCKLES)

47:33.769 --> 47:35.229
Will you fight me?

47:36.605 --> 47:40.985
- Will you fight my brother?
- I would like that.

47:45.990 --> 47:49.994
- You alone will kneel.
- I will not.

47:50.119 --> 47:53.706
- Kneel!
- (CROWD LAUGHS)

48:00.004 --> 48:04.091
I have come to negotiate.
I demand respect.

48:04.216 --> 48:07.928
If you do not wish to hear my price,
then I will leave, happily.

48:09.847 --> 48:15.227
- Aethelflaed.
- As you can see, she is well.

48:17.730 --> 48:20.399
- I would like to speak with her.
- Then do it.

48:34.121 --> 48:38.375
- They are treating you well?
- They are.

48:38.501 --> 48:45.132
- You have not been... touched?
- I have not.

48:47.927 --> 48:49.095
(SIGHS)

48:51.222 --> 48:52.431
(WHISPERS) What I must now do

48:52.556 --> 48:55.643
is secure an acceptable price
for your release.

48:55.768 --> 49:01.857
There will be word games played.
Do not be alarmed by what I may say.

49:01.982 --> 49:04.568
I assure you, once this is over,

49:04.693 --> 49:06.946
they shall pay
for what they have done to us all.

49:08.864 --> 49:10.324
Thank you, lord.

49:16.789 --> 49:20.751
What is your price?
It must be fair or you can keep her.

49:20.876 --> 49:25.089
(LAUGHS) You talk of your woman
like you do not care.

49:25.214 --> 49:27.716
She is important to me, of course,
but she has a price,

49:27.842 --> 49:31.470
beyond which I cannot go.
I will not go.

49:31.595 --> 49:35.224
Then name it. Name this price.

49:38.394 --> 49:40.771
One hundred pounds' weight of silver.

49:41.981 --> 49:44.358
My lands can afford no more.

49:51.740 --> 49:55.578
- Does this man speak for Alfred?
- He does not.

49:57.580 --> 49:58.998
Hmm.

50:00.666 --> 50:01.792
Weland!

50:01.917 --> 50:07.214
Wh-Where is Weland?
I do not see him. Weland!

50:07.339 --> 50:09.258
Weland!

50:12.219 --> 50:14.180
Ah. Weland.

50:22.730 --> 50:25.441
This... man here.

50:27.526 --> 50:28.611
Hit him.

50:39.288 --> 50:41.624
UHTRED: She is a daughter, not a son.

50:42.416 --> 50:44.835
Unloved and, in truth,
banished to Mercia

50:44.960 --> 50:50.007
to spend life being humped by a husband
you have so generously put to bed.

50:50.132 --> 50:53.427
Like her husband,
Alfred's not minded to pay a great sum.

50:53.552 --> 50:57.097
- Alfred's price is what? Say it.
- I will.

50:57.223 --> 51:02.394
Separate from the 100 pounds' weight
of silver offered by the husband,

51:02.519 --> 51:06.315
Alfred will add another
200 pounds' weight of silver.

51:07.483 --> 51:10.819
- Three hundred pounds in total.
- A good price.

51:10.945 --> 51:14.698
The daughter of a Frankish king was once
bargained for a similar price. Pyrlig?

51:14.823 --> 51:20.037
- This is true, it is a good price.
- (LAUGHS)

51:22.498 --> 51:25.459
No. No, no, no, n0, n0, n0-

51:25.584 --> 51:30.339
No, Alfred is not a Frankish king
and it is not a good price.

51:30.464 --> 51:35.261
- I say it's a good price.
- Like the pig's arse, you have farted.

51:35.386 --> 51:36.971
(MAN BLOW RASPBERRY,
CROWD LAUGHS)

51:37.096 --> 51:41.934
Yes! And it stinks.
By the gods, does it stink!

51:42.059 --> 51:44.395
- Open the doors.
- It is a good price?

51:44.520 --> 51:47.773
- I think it's a good price.
- You insult me!

51:49.858 --> 51:52.695
If Alfred is minded to offer so little,

51:52.820 --> 51:55.197
then I am minded
to bring her into this hall

51:55.322 --> 51:57.992
and allow each man here
to take his turn.

52:00.869 --> 52:07.001
I swear, she will be tied to a cart
and she will travel the kingdoms.

52:08.419 --> 52:12.506
Is that what you want... Saxon?

52:13.549 --> 52:17.469
- Do not insult me.
- I'm not insulting you.

52:17.594 --> 52:20.264
Do not.

52:29.940 --> 52:33.235
The king has given me
some discretion to increase the price.

52:34.320 --> 52:36.447
(LAUGHS)

52:36.572 --> 52:39.825
What a surprise.

52:41.076 --> 52:44.163
So, say it.

52:44.288 --> 52:48.542
Lord, ifl may,
and to save both time and ink,

52:48.667 --> 52:51.670
perhaps you might name a price.

52:51.837 --> 52:54.590
An acceptable price.
Not an impossible price.

52:56.300 --> 52:57.426
Say it.

53:01.263 --> 53:04.391
(CLEARS THROAT)

53:04.516 --> 53:06.310
Ten thousand pounds' weight of silver

53:06.435 --> 53:08.687
and one thousand pounds' weight of gold.

53:08.812 --> 53:13.108
- Delivered by Alfred himself.
- Of course.

53:13.233 --> 53:17.529
And he shall arrive with a stoat upon
his head and an apple in his mouth.

53:17.654 --> 53:19.073
With respect, Sigefrid,

53:19.198 --> 53:23.077
you fart louder and longer
than the pig's arse and I together.

53:26.246 --> 53:28.665
I need to take a piss.
It's going to be a long day.

53:49.186 --> 53:51.021
(GROANS)

53:51.146 --> 53:53.023
(mes SNORT)

53:56.193 --> 53:57.528
(GASPS)

54:09.248 --> 54:11.917
(LAUGHTER)

54:34.898 --> 54:37.734
Aethelred, lord of Mercia!

54:37.860 --> 54:42.614
If yourjaw is not broken, join us! Eat.

54:42.739 --> 54:47.327
Yes, I will. I would enjoy that.

54:47.453 --> 54:50.080
- (QUIETLY) Business is done.
- Done?

54:50.205 --> 54:52.291
A bargain has been made
and not a good one.

54:52.416 --> 54:53.500
Say nothing.

54:53.625 --> 54:57.671
Uhtred and Father Pyrlig have gone
to see how your lady is, lord.

54:57.796 --> 55:02.092
- Then I will go to her.
- Hm-mm, no.

55:02.217 --> 55:06.054
You will wait here. You will sit.

55:07.723 --> 55:09.266
With me.

55:21.528 --> 55:25.699
- To silver and gold.
- And lots of it, lord.

55:25.824 --> 55:27.034
(QUIETLY) Drink.

55:32.331 --> 55:33.540
<i>ERIK: She's praying.</i>

55:36.084 --> 55:38.670
Give her time with the priest
and then you will see her.

55:41.215 --> 55:42.716
Twenty-six ships.

55:42.841 --> 55:48.388
By the next moon, there will be more.
And more still the moon after.

55:49.014 --> 55:51.099
Alfred will pay for his own destruction.

55:51.225 --> 55:53.852
You should not underestimate
Alfred of Wessex.

55:53.977 --> 55:58.982
Never. But he will pay
what you have agreed?

55:59.983 --> 56:04.404
- He will.
- Even for an unloved daughter?

56:05.572 --> 56:08.992
Alfred is suffering.
He loves her dearly.

56:09.117 --> 56:11.370
Her husband does not.

56:11.495 --> 56:13.830
I was surprised at your anger
towards Aethelred.

56:15.123 --> 56:20.045
- What purpose did it serve?
- It was a mistake.

56:20.170 --> 56:25.050
It was. You made it clear
that you care for her.

56:31.682 --> 56:34.768
I cannot let her go.

56:35.686 --> 56:37.354
I cannot give her up.

56:39.147 --> 56:43.235
We have just settled on a price.
There is agreement.

56:43.360 --> 56:45.445
With my brother.

57:00.502 --> 57:03.005
- Lord Uhtred.
- Lady.

57:04.548 --> 57:06.258
Your father sends his affection.

57:07.259 --> 57:10.596
He will be sleeping at the altar,
I'm sure.

57:10.721 --> 57:14.600
I have arranged your release.
You will soon be coming home.

57:15.934 --> 57:17.644
Have you spoken with Erik?

57:17.769 --> 57:19.896
(DOOR CLOSES NEARBY)

57:20.022 --> 57:21.607
I have.

57:22.899 --> 57:24.026
What has he told you?

57:27.654 --> 57:31.825
- Lady, he's a Northman and a pagan.
- He is a pagan as you are a pagan.

57:31.950 --> 57:34.661
Any hope that you have
of a life together is nonsense.

57:34.786 --> 57:36.747
- It will fail.
- It will not.

57:36.872 --> 57:41.293
Merely because it's what you wish for?
Lady, it can never happen.

57:41.418 --> 57:45.339
- Well, it must.
- What of your husband?

57:45.464 --> 57:50.052
I will not talk of my husband.
I... I do not care for him.

57:50.177 --> 57:52.429
- And I will never care for him.
- He will not stand by.

57:52.554 --> 57:53.597
I do not care.

57:53.722 --> 57:57.559
Sigefrid will not stand by
and your father will not stand by.

57:57.684 --> 58:01.229
- You will lose your entire family.
- I will make a family.

58:01.355 --> 58:04.483
- We will make a family, Erik and I.
- And they will die.

58:04.608 --> 58:07.778
As you will die.
In a fire, at the tip of a sword.

58:07.903 --> 58:10.322
- Then I will die happily.
- Aethelflaed, hear me.

58:10.447 --> 58:12.574
There will be no rest. None.

58:12.699 --> 58:15.327
A life with Erik is what I want.

58:15.452 --> 58:18.246
It is best for me
and it is best for Wessex.

58:20.290 --> 58:24.086
I can say this to no one but you.

58:24.211 --> 58:27.798
I can... I can ask no one but you.

58:31.968 --> 58:34.012
Will you help us escape?

58:38.016 --> 58:40.811
Lady, I am sworn to your father.

58:40.936 --> 58:43.647
If I help you and succeed,
he'll have me killed.

58:43.772 --> 58:46.775
But more than that, you are asking me
to sanction your own death.

58:46.900 --> 58:50.404
No, what I am asking
is for you to allow me to live.

58:51.530 --> 58:55.617
I will not be the treasure
that builds an army against my father.

58:55.742 --> 58:59.663
That will not happen. Never.

58:59.788 --> 59:05.001
I will leave this place with Erik
or I will not leave at all.
