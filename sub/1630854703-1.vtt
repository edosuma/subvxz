WEBVTT

00:32.583 --> 00:33.416
God.

00:34.416 --> 00:38.666
I get tuna every time and I hate tuna.
You know I hate tuna, but I just… get it.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.583
-It's like… What'd you get?
-Italian.

00:40.666 --> 00:43.125
See, that… That's a good choice.
Italian is a good sandwich.

00:44.208 --> 00:46.208
-What's up, babe?
-Oh, no.

00:47.416 --> 00:49.375
Fields, whatever you do,
don't look to your left.

00:51.958 --> 00:53.333
Oh, no way.

00:54.375 --> 00:55.291
Sorry, pal.

00:57.541 --> 01:01.375
Just one week into senior year.
How'd she just leave me?

01:01.458 --> 01:02.708
Apparently by text.

01:05.125 --> 01:06.583
I… I can't eat this.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.625
-I feel so alone.
-Yeah.

01:08.708 --> 01:10.916
"Loneliness and the feeling
of being unwanted

01:11.000 --> 01:12.500
is the most terrible poverty."

01:12.583 --> 01:15.583
Mother Teresa, who, by the way,
I guarantee you was never dumped.

01:15.666 --> 01:20.166
I mean, seriously, you dump her,
that is one-way ticket downstairs.

01:20.250 --> 01:21.791
Shh! Is that the guy?

01:22.291 --> 01:23.333
Who?

01:24.041 --> 01:27.375
-She left me for a Frisbee guy?
-You're a Frisbee guy.

01:27.458 --> 01:29.000
No, not like him. He's, like…

01:30.500 --> 01:31.333
shirtless.

01:32.500 --> 01:33.666
He looks great.

01:34.416 --> 01:35.500
-Thank you.
-Well.

01:36.083 --> 01:37.583
I think that tonight,

01:37.666 --> 01:39.458
we should go down to the Bobcat,

01:39.541 --> 01:42.375
get some drinks, get some wings,

01:42.458 --> 01:44.583
forget about Claire and this Adonis.

01:45.833 --> 01:47.208
You…

01:47.291 --> 01:48.291
Where'd you go?

01:50.500 --> 01:52.583
You aren't listening.

01:54.666 --> 01:55.833
Let's go to the pound.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.625
-This is a mistake.

01:57.708 --> 01:59.875
Okay, I have love to give,
and Claire doesn't want it.

01:59.958 --> 02:02.583
I love you, babe. Me, I do.
Can we go now, please?

02:02.666 --> 02:03.791
I am getting a dog.

02:03.875 --> 02:05.708
When was the last time you showered?

02:07.500 --> 02:08.500
It was a Tuesday.

02:08.583 --> 02:12.875
Listen, dogs, they need shots.
They need food and water every day.

02:12.958 --> 02:14.000
-Okay?
-Yeah.

02:14.083 --> 02:14.916
You are just…

02:16.041 --> 02:18.250
You're ill-equipped.
I'm sorry. You just are.

02:19.500 --> 02:21.625
-"What is man without the beasts?"
-Oh, no.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.000
"For if all the beasts were gone,

02:23.083 --> 02:27.000
man would die
of a great loneliness of the spirit."

02:27.083 --> 02:29.458
-It's Chief Seattle.
-I know it's Chief Seattle. I know it is.

02:29.541 --> 02:32.791
Just listen. A B-minus
in Native American studies

02:32.875 --> 02:34.875
does not qualify you
to care for an animal.

02:34.958 --> 02:38.041
-Also, please don't ever do that again.
-Why?

02:38.125 --> 02:41.458
It's very off-putting when you quote
smart dead guys back at me.

02:41.541 --> 02:43.458
That's my thing.
Philosophical arts, my thing.

02:43.541 --> 02:44.875
-You know it.
-Okay.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.375
Oh, no.

02:51.458 --> 02:52.791
Well, hey!

02:55.625 --> 02:57.041
What's up, pup?

03:02.333 --> 03:03.166
I love him.

03:06.708 --> 03:08.041
And he loves me.

03:14.750 --> 03:16.208
Whoop! That's a big bag.

03:16.791 --> 03:20.541
All right. Oh, and I need him to imprint
on me, so don't, like, bond with him.

03:20.625 --> 03:21.750
Done and done.

03:21.833 --> 03:24.541
You know what, little buddy?
I am gonna find the perfect song

03:24.625 --> 03:26.083
for our first car ride together.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.875
Why is it so warm in here?

03:31.958 --> 03:34.208
I told you, the AC is still broken.

03:34.958 --> 03:36.666
-Oh, my God!
-Don't scare him.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.458
-He's peeing on me!
-Whoa! Oh, yeah.

03:38.541 --> 03:40.541
-Fields, take your dog right now.
-I don't want him!

03:40.625 --> 03:41.833
-I don't want him!
-Hold on!

03:41.916 --> 03:43.291
Take him right now. I swear to God.

03:43.375 --> 03:46.250
Listen, I don't want his first
five minutes with us to be traumatizing,

03:46.333 --> 03:48.583
so just, like, let him do his thing.

03:51.041 --> 03:52.833
This is the worst thing
that has ever happened.

03:52.916 --> 03:54.708
-He likes you.

03:55.291 --> 03:56.500
Why is there so much?

03:56.583 --> 03:58.458
-I don't…

03:59.166 --> 04:00.666
Yeah. Wow. All right.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.583
Maybe we shouldn't look.

04:07.166 --> 04:08.916
Oh! Yeah! Okay.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.708
Oh, a little bit more.

04:12.833 --> 04:14.333
Okay, he's done.

04:14.416 --> 04:16.791
Good boy! Good boy.

04:16.875 --> 04:17.833
Good boys.

04:17.916 --> 04:19.666
Very good boys. Both of you.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.541
-I hate you.
-You love me.

04:21.625 --> 04:23.500
Time to take this fella home.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.000
Puppy coming through!

04:46.166 --> 04:47.041
Puppy!

04:47.125 --> 04:48.250
I got the VIP.

04:48.333 --> 04:49.291
Oh, hi!

04:49.375 --> 04:51.458
-I know. I know. I know.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.166
Hi!

04:57.833 --> 04:59.083
You having fun, buddy?

05:00.250 --> 05:02.625
Oh. You know this is all for you, right?

05:03.125 --> 05:05.458
This is your homecoming.

05:05.541 --> 05:08.500
This party is fun.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.208
I cannot believe
that all these people showed up for…

05:13.541 --> 05:14.583
What is his name?

05:15.250 --> 05:16.166
I don't know.

05:17.041 --> 05:18.166
What is your name?

05:20.625 --> 05:22.416
He gonked me on the head.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.375
-He did what?
-I mean… I mean bonked.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.791
-Wait, that's it.
-What is it?

05:29.708 --> 05:31.458
-"Gonker."

05:31.541 --> 05:34.416
-Hey, yeah, he likes it. Gonker.
-What is a gonker?

05:36.208 --> 05:37.416
He's a Gonker.

05:37.500 --> 05:41.083
Gonker! Gonker! Gonker!

05:41.166 --> 05:47.791
Gonker! Gonker! Gonker!
Gonker! Gonker! Gonker! Gonker!

06:01.958 --> 06:03.666
We're gonna be late to class.

06:11.791 --> 06:13.416
Take a deep breath,

06:13.958 --> 06:17.500
and we're gonna glide into downward dog.

06:21.375 --> 06:22.333
Ready?

06:22.416 --> 06:23.416
Go. Go get it.

06:24.541 --> 06:25.791
No, come back. Come back.

06:26.958 --> 06:30.250
-Oh, go get it! Come on.

06:30.333 --> 06:31.916
Go, come on.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.458
-Hey! Whoosh!

06:44.958 --> 06:46.583
Yeah, there you go!

06:46.666 --> 06:48.708
There you go, buddy! Come here.

07:02.375 --> 07:04.583
Yes! That's it, buddy!
Bring it back.

07:10.625 --> 07:13.958
Boosh! You guys see it?
What did I tell you? The boy is talented.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.458
I'm not opening a haunted house with you.

07:23.541 --> 07:25.666
Wait.
Did you guys hear about Lainey?

07:25.750 --> 07:28.750
-What?
-She got a job at Boeing. Six figures.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.166
-No, stop.
-Really?

07:30.250 --> 07:32.166
-Wow.
-Six figures? Like, in money?

07:32.250 --> 07:34.625
-Yeah, and she gets to stay in Virginia.
-Stop.

07:35.208 --> 07:37.958
-I don't know anyone in St. Louis.
-What's in St. Louis?

07:38.500 --> 07:40.041
-My job.
-Yeah.

07:40.125 --> 07:41.916
I'm doing PR for Anheuser-Busch.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
-I start in, like, two weeks.
-You didn't know that?

07:44.083 --> 07:47.041
-You're working for a beer company?
-Dream job, right?

07:47.125 --> 07:50.250
Wait, hold on. Do… Do you all have jobs?

07:50.333 --> 07:52.333
Uh, yeah, bud, we do.

07:52.416 --> 07:55.541
Kinda. We just, uh, didn't…
didn't wanna say anything.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.875
Well, okay. Wait, hold on now.

07:57.958 --> 08:00.833
I'm… I'm not some loser
who can't get a job.

08:00.916 --> 08:03.916
I just…
I don't know what job I can do yet,

08:04.000 --> 08:06.625
so I gotta, like,
figure that out first, you know?

08:06.708 --> 08:09.958
Right. Isn't that kinda what
the last four years were for, though?

08:10.041 --> 08:11.166
Mmm…

08:15.166 --> 08:16.875
-That's my parents.
-Yes, it is.

08:16.958 --> 08:18.583
-Uh, hide the beers.
-Good idea.

08:18.666 --> 08:20.750
-Uh, we're 21.
-It's 10:30 in the morning.

08:20.833 --> 08:21.708
Good point.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.708
-Fielding!
-Hey, Mom.

08:29.791 --> 08:31.000
Hi!

08:31.083 --> 08:33.083
-Fielding!
-Dad.

08:33.750 --> 08:36.250
What… What are you guys doing here?

08:36.333 --> 08:41.375
Well, I… I think my investment entitles
me to see you in a robe and a funny hat.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.708
Well, graduation's tomorrow.

08:43.791 --> 08:46.625
Yeah. We told you
that we were coming up the day before.

08:46.708 --> 08:50.333
Right. Sorry. I forgot about that.
I've, um, been busy.

08:50.416 --> 08:51.250
Oh.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.750
Yeah, I can see that.

08:56.791 --> 08:58.125
Well, we have a surprise for you.

08:58.208 --> 08:59.041
Oh.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.541
Oh, a surprise!

09:01.250 --> 09:04.375
Is that Peyton I see? Come here!
What? Oh, my God.

09:04.458 --> 09:05.958
W-What are you doing here?

09:06.041 --> 09:07.583
You know, I took my last exam early

09:07.666 --> 09:09.875
so I could fly out
and see my bro get his parchment.

09:09.958 --> 09:12.458
-Look at you. Best sister ever.
-You know. I try.

09:12.541 --> 09:13.750
-Oh!

09:13.833 --> 09:16.083
Whoa, Gonker! Sorry about that.

09:16.166 --> 09:17.583
-That's okay.
-Whoa, hey!

09:17.666 --> 09:19.250
-All right.
-Whose dog is this?

09:19.333 --> 09:20.291
He's…

09:23.375 --> 09:24.708
It's a bad idea.

09:24.791 --> 09:27.166
Okay, well, it's not an idea.
It's a reality.

09:27.250 --> 09:28.250
It's a mistake.

09:28.333 --> 09:31.166
He's not a mistake.
He's… He's my best friend.

09:31.250 --> 09:35.000
You can't even take care of yourself,
let alone another living being.

09:35.083 --> 09:37.291
Okay, I take care of Gonker just fine.

09:37.375 --> 09:39.458
So why's he drinking out of a beer bong?

09:42.000 --> 09:45.333
He's not. That's a chemistry thing.

09:45.416 --> 09:47.208
Come here, Gonker. Come on, buddy.

09:47.708 --> 09:48.791
Come on, let's go.

09:50.708 --> 09:54.708
-What kind of a name is "Gonker"?
-He gonked me in the head.

09:55.375 --> 09:57.125
I see you haven't recovered
from the trauma.

09:58.083 --> 10:01.416
Look, son, you're about to head out
into the real world.

10:01.500 --> 10:03.541
You're not gonna have any time
to spend with Gonker.

10:03.625 --> 10:05.625
What's he gonna do
when you're at work all day?

10:05.708 --> 10:06.708
"Work"?

10:07.208 --> 10:08.625
Dad, come on.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.958
Have you called Mr. Kobrenner?

10:13.958 --> 10:16.041
Accounting? I suck at math.

10:16.125 --> 10:17.666
Or Matt Price at Harper Lewis.

10:17.750 --> 10:21.416
Dad, I'm not equipped
to handle medical supplies sales.

10:21.500 --> 10:25.083
Then what are you gonna do
when, in 24 hours, this whole party ends?

10:25.166 --> 10:27.125
Other than be back at home
with Mom and Dad,

10:27.208 --> 10:29.208
exactly where you were four years ago.

10:34.125 --> 10:36.458
-Come on, boy.

10:41.875 --> 10:42.708
Hi.

10:44.041 --> 10:45.375
Uh, excuse me, sorry. Hey.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.291
Uh, come on. Excuse me, sorry. Sorry.

10:48.375 --> 10:50.500
Oh, Mom, Dad.

10:53.125 --> 10:54.541
I don't know what to say.

10:54.625 --> 10:55.458
Um…

10:55.541 --> 10:57.541
It's fine.
I'm sure there'll be another ceremony.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.041
Oh, wait. There's only one.

11:00.375 --> 11:01.750
Fielding, what happened?

11:01.833 --> 11:04.291
Well, I really took to heart
what Dad said yesterday

11:04.375 --> 11:07.041
about how I only
had 24 hours left here, so…

11:07.541 --> 11:10.791
Uh, Gonk and I slept out by the river
'cause he loves it there.

11:10.875 --> 11:13.166
We listened to frogs
and talked about the stars.

11:13.250 --> 11:15.125
-You talked?
-And we played flashlight chase.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.833
-He likes to chase a light on the ground.
-We can do the math.

11:17.916 --> 11:18.833
Right.

11:18.916 --> 11:22.958
And we must have fallen asleep
pretty late, 'cause, um, I overslept.

11:23.958 --> 11:26.750
Well, I'm sure it's worth
the six-hour round trip

11:26.833 --> 11:29.583
just to see 4,000 strangers
all dressed in the same outfit.

11:29.666 --> 11:33.666
It's okay. We can still go out
for a celebratory meal, right?

11:34.333 --> 11:36.291
Actually, Mom, I, um…

11:36.791 --> 11:39.625
My stomach's been feeling a little off
the past few days.

11:40.583 --> 11:42.250
Uh, maybe we can rain check?

11:44.375 --> 11:45.375
Sure.

11:45.458 --> 11:49.125
Yeah, we'll have plenty of time
for family meals back home.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.791
It's all right. I, uh…

11:50.875 --> 11:53.125
It's okay. Accidents happen.

11:53.791 --> 11:55.000
I'm really proud of you.

11:55.083 --> 11:56.708
-And I love you.
-I love you too.

11:56.791 --> 11:59.625
Well, congratulations on graduating.

12:00.708 --> 12:01.541
Drive safe.

12:01.625 --> 12:04.000
Thanks. And, again, I'm so sorry.

12:05.791 --> 12:06.625
Um…

12:07.208 --> 12:08.416
I'll see you tomorrow.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.833
Um, no, I'm going back to Seattle tonight.

12:11.916 --> 12:12.833
What?

12:13.625 --> 12:16.125
Wait, just you, you…
You cannot leave me alone with them.

12:16.208 --> 12:18.291
I got a summer job
in the Creative Writing department.

12:19.416 --> 12:21.791
Look, you say
you don't wanna live with the 'rents,

12:21.875 --> 12:23.958
then why don't you get a job
and go pay rent?

12:24.458 --> 12:27.208
Besides, you won't be alone, right?
You got Gonker.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.000
Uh, he wants you to rub his belly.

12:39.500 --> 12:43.250
-All right, Mr. Big Adult Professor Man.
-You could do it too.

12:43.833 --> 12:46.041
Yeah, grad school? For what?

12:47.500 --> 12:48.375
Good point.

12:49.708 --> 12:52.125
I'm gonna miss you too, buddy.
All right? Now, listen.

12:52.208 --> 12:55.708
Don't let the suburbs tame you, all right?
You're a wild beast.

12:55.791 --> 12:57.541
-Don't forget it.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.333
How lucky am I to have something
that makes saying goodbye so hard?

13:04.416 --> 13:05.250
Oh, Gandhi.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.291
Winnie the Pooh, man. Come here.

13:10.166 --> 13:11.333
Take care, all right?

13:12.750 --> 13:14.166
-Dude, do the…
-No.

13:14.250 --> 13:15.333
-No?
-I'll work on it.

13:15.416 --> 13:17.041
I still wanna do the bird thing.

13:19.041 --> 13:21.541
-Next time. See ya.
-Later, buddy.

13:50.208 --> 13:52.625
It's okay, boy. We'll figure it out.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.208
This is it.

14:22.041 --> 14:24.625
Hey, there's gonna be
an adjustment period,

14:24.708 --> 14:25.541
so let's just…

14:25.625 --> 14:28.166
Hey, let's just play it cool, all right?

14:29.666 --> 14:31.041
-We're home.

14:31.125 --> 14:34.083
Aw, the graduates are back!

14:34.583 --> 14:35.666
Hi! Oh!

14:35.750 --> 14:38.416
Oh, Gonk, down!
Hey, down, boy. Hey.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.375
-He wants to kiss you.
-That's so nice.

14:40.458 --> 14:41.875
Here you go, sport.

14:41.958 --> 14:43.291
Uh, what's this?

14:43.375 --> 14:44.208
Shock collar.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.125
Oh, no, he's… He's not wearing this.

14:48.041 --> 14:51.416
-Mom, he's a wild beast.
-He's a domesticated animal.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.541
Let's not go that far.
You saw the frat house.

14:53.625 --> 14:57.583
No, I'm serious. He's used to being free.
He ran around campus all the time.

14:57.666 --> 14:59.750
We're not on campus anymore.
We're in civilization.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.958
And in civilization, people keep
their refrigerators in their kitchen

15:04.041 --> 15:05.333
and their dogs in the yard.

15:05.416 --> 15:06.333
No, I--

15:07.083 --> 15:11.166
So we have some sensors
set up outside right by the woods,

15:11.250 --> 15:13.791
so he can get close, but not too close.

15:13.875 --> 15:16.791
And if he does, he gets a little zap.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.875
Not enough to hurt him,
just enough to teach him.

15:19.375 --> 15:22.041
-It's gonna break his spirit.
-It goes on his neck, not his spirit.

15:31.833 --> 15:34.083
What are… What is it, buddy?

15:36.791 --> 15:38.541
No, no, no! Gonker!

15:39.083 --> 15:41.625
-Hey! Hey! Gonker! Gonker, come on, man!
-Oh!

15:41.708 --> 15:44.208
-Don't worry, the collar will stop him.
-Gonker!

15:44.291 --> 15:46.000
Gonker! Hey! Hey!

15:46.083 --> 15:47.375
-No!
-Gonker!

15:47.458 --> 15:49.208
-He's getting away!
-No!

15:50.833 --> 15:53.041
-Oh, what?

15:56.333 --> 16:00.416
Oh, yeah, Gonk! Fight the power!
You go get that fox!

16:02.500 --> 16:04.250
They told me it would stop any dog.

16:05.250 --> 16:07.208
Well, Gonker isn't any dog.

16:07.291 --> 16:09.208
What if he gets lost?

16:09.291 --> 16:12.375
No, Mom, he'd run around campus for hours.
He always came back.

16:12.458 --> 16:16.166
-But he doesn't know his way around here.
-He'll be fine. I promise.

16:17.125 --> 16:19.291
No, he's a really, really special dog.

16:21.916 --> 16:24.625
A bit of Japan that I can leave behind.

16:26.875 --> 16:29.333
For your family's hospitality
during our visit.

16:29.416 --> 16:31.000
-He's yours now.

16:32.333 --> 16:33.291
His name is Oji.

16:34.041 --> 16:35.208
I love him.

16:37.416 --> 16:38.458
Can I play with him?

16:39.916 --> 16:41.416
Fifty meters in either direction.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.416
We need to go to town soon.
I don't want to have to look for you.

16:45.166 --> 16:46.166
Come on, Oji.

16:51.625 --> 16:52.458
Come on, boy.

16:55.875 --> 16:59.083
-Want some food?
-Uh, no, I'm fine, but I could use a nap.

17:06.875 --> 17:08.083
-What?
-Oh, God.

17:17.125 --> 17:17.958
Son?

17:20.375 --> 17:21.208
Son!

17:22.208 --> 17:25.666
-Oh, hey. I'm sorry. Did I wake you?
-I think you woke your Aunt Jenny.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.791
-She's been dead for nine years.
-What are you doing?

17:27.875 --> 17:30.083
Oh, it's a breathing technique.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.166
A modified Agni Prasana<i>. </i>It's…

17:32.250 --> 17:36.083
We time it to the end of our sleep cycle.
Keeps me centered, stabilizes my gut.

17:36.750 --> 17:37.583
What's his deal?

17:37.666 --> 17:38.500
Uh…

17:39.250 --> 17:43.583
Oh, he likes to do it with me.
Or maybe he just wants a belly rub?

17:43.666 --> 17:45.000
Don't look at me, pal.

17:46.750 --> 17:47.583
Okay, bye.

17:49.750 --> 17:53.166
So our assessment is that
any positive movement in the next quarter

17:53.250 --> 17:54.375
is gonna be unlikely.

17:54.458 --> 17:56.958
<i>So you're holding off</i>
<i>on investments until when?</i>

17:57.041 --> 18:00.041
No. My team's telling me
you should keep your powder dry,

18:00.125 --> 18:02.875
at least until the local elections
or maybe after the rainy season.

18:02.958 --> 18:05.875
<i>Implementing a program is</i>
<i>gonna be possible at some point, right?</i>

18:05.958 --> 18:07.333
Can you excuse me for one second?

18:07.416 --> 18:08.791
-I'm so sorry.
-<i>Uh, sure.</i>

18:09.625 --> 18:10.583
Fielding!

18:14.000 --> 18:14.833
Yes, sir?

18:14.916 --> 18:18.291
I'm on a Zoom call with five people.
He's just sitting here whining.

18:18.916 --> 18:20.041
He wants to play fetch.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
All right.

18:27.791 --> 18:28.625
Go get it.

18:32.125 --> 18:33.750
He needs to choose the stick.

18:34.750 --> 18:35.666
He needs to choose it?

18:35.750 --> 18:37.666
-Yeah, it changes every day.

18:41.666 --> 18:42.583
Now what?

18:44.125 --> 18:45.750
He wants you to watch him choose.

18:46.833 --> 18:48.416
It's no fun if you don't watch.

18:51.541 --> 18:52.625
Hey.

18:54.041 --> 18:54.916
I'm watching.

19:01.625 --> 19:02.958
-Oh!

19:03.916 --> 19:06.666
You have your bed and I have my bed.

19:06.750 --> 19:09.625
And… this is my bed!

19:19.083 --> 19:20.791
They choose popes quicker.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.583
I give up!

19:29.250 --> 19:32.208
-I give up.

19:38.458 --> 19:41.083
When you're done,
please smother me to death as well.

19:53.666 --> 19:55.750
Oh, you like birds too, huh?

19:56.666 --> 19:58.250
You're not a wild beast.

19:59.541 --> 20:01.041
You're a sweetheart, aren't you?

20:05.750 --> 20:06.750
Oh!

20:06.833 --> 20:09.041
You're certain about this? All right.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.250
Go get it!

20:26.958 --> 20:28.458
Yes! That's it, boy!

20:28.541 --> 20:31.541
-That was actually kinda cool.
-Hooray!

20:31.625 --> 20:33.125
Wait. Did you see that?

20:33.208 --> 20:34.666
-Yes!
-Yes!

20:34.750 --> 20:35.958
Yeah, that's a good boy!

20:36.041 --> 20:37.916
-That was impressive!
-That's a talented boy!

20:48.791 --> 20:49.750
Gonker?

20:51.708 --> 20:53.416
Worst-named dog in the world.

20:56.541 --> 20:58.833
-Gonker?

21:06.750 --> 21:07.875
What are you doing?

21:09.458 --> 21:10.333
Hmm?

21:11.083 --> 21:12.541
-Oh.

21:12.625 --> 21:14.750
You're scared
of the thunder and lightning.

21:16.333 --> 21:17.916
Aren't you? Yeah.

21:19.208 --> 21:21.125
Just like Fielding when he was little.

21:23.666 --> 21:26.416
You know, I used to have
to sing to him to make him feel better.

22:06.083 --> 22:06.916
Yeah.

22:10.708 --> 22:12.333
I'm home!

22:12.416 --> 22:15.291
I got blueberry pie
from the farmers market

22:15.375 --> 22:17.416
for when the Connors come.

22:17.500 --> 22:21.125
And I got banana cream for us
'cause we deserve it.

22:22.333 --> 22:25.000
What, no greeting?

22:27.541 --> 22:31.208
You all tuckered out
from fetch and foxes and things--

22:32.500 --> 22:34.916
Oh, shoot.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.916
All right.

22:39.666 --> 22:42.333
I'll get the big pieces,
and you come get the rest.

22:47.916 --> 22:50.500
Hey, Fielding. Come here for a sec.

22:50.583 --> 22:52.750
Uh-oh!

22:52.833 --> 22:54.208
You want me to get the mop?

22:54.708 --> 22:57.291
No, it's Gonker.
He didn't greet me when I came in.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.833
And now there's food on the floor
and he's not touching it?

23:02.000 --> 23:03.291
He didn't eat his breakfast?

23:05.583 --> 23:08.291
I think that's his dinner from last night.

23:11.416 --> 23:13.583
Hey, boy,
you wanna go for a run?

23:15.958 --> 23:18.125
No? Hey, come on! Come on, let's go play!

23:24.916 --> 23:26.833
-Mom?
-I'll call the vet.

23:29.083 --> 23:30.916
Hey. It's okay.

24:12.583 --> 24:16.625
Addison's disease is when the body
fails to produce enough glucocorticoids.

24:16.708 --> 24:21.166
You fall into adrenal insufficiency,
which causes pain, low blood pressure.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.833
You can lapse into a coma.

24:22.916 --> 24:24.583
Wait. He's in a coma?

24:24.666 --> 24:26.166
Oh, no, he's sedated.

24:26.666 --> 24:30.000
Now, with medication,
Addison's can be controlled,

24:30.083 --> 24:33.625
but Gonker's condition
had laid dormant his entire life.

24:34.125 --> 24:38.291
And he's had an acute episode.
He's not out of the woods yet.

24:38.375 --> 24:41.541
And if he survives,
he's going to need a shot every 30 days.

24:41.625 --> 24:43.166
If he survives?

24:43.250 --> 24:46.416
I'm sorry, but it's 50/50
he makes it through the night.

24:49.291 --> 24:50.208
Um…

24:50.291 --> 24:51.708
Then I'm gonna stay with him.

24:51.791 --> 24:54.916
Not a good idea. He's gonna lapse
in and out of consciousness.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.166
And if he sees you,
it'll rile him up, and he needs sleep.

24:58.666 --> 25:00.500
Best thing for both of you is rest.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.500
My staff and I will be with him
around the clock.

25:05.500 --> 25:06.333
I promise.

25:17.458 --> 25:21.333
Here. Now Gonker can have
some nice clean bowls when he gets back.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.625
Yeah, if he gets back.

25:24.458 --> 25:25.416
Don't talk like that.

25:25.500 --> 25:28.208
Well, they said online
it's worse the longer it goes untreated.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.916
He spent the whole first year of his life
with no medication, nothing.

25:32.000 --> 25:35.416
In college, did you ever notice him
getting worn out or anything?

25:35.500 --> 25:36.916
Well, some days,

25:37.000 --> 25:41.166
but I thought he was tired from,
you know, playing fetch or hiking.

25:41.250 --> 25:43.791
This is what we were saying.
Having a dog is a responsibility.

25:43.875 --> 25:48.125
When you care for someone,
it can't just be sometimes or playtime.

25:48.875 --> 25:50.208
It has to be all the time.

26:07.333 --> 26:11.708
-He's been like this since 6:00 a.m.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.625
Never seen a rebound like this in any dog.

26:18.291 --> 26:19.750
Gonker!

26:19.833 --> 26:21.541
-Yeah, boy!
-Hi!

26:30.791 --> 26:31.958
There you go.

26:32.041 --> 26:33.416
You're invincible, boy.

26:33.916 --> 26:35.000
You're so strong.

26:42.291 --> 26:44.750
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Are you so excited?

26:44.833 --> 26:46.166
Are you so excited?

26:46.708 --> 26:50.375
Yummy. That's right.
I make really good food, don't I?

26:51.666 --> 26:52.500
Ah!

26:52.583 --> 26:54.916
I would have gone with the birch
if it were me.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.458
All right. Come on, boy. Ready?

26:56.541 --> 26:59.250
Gonna race. You get a head start.
Go. Go on! Get it!

26:59.333 --> 27:01.250
I'm coming to get it!
I'm coming to get it!

27:10.666 --> 27:11.791
Who's a good boy?

27:11.875 --> 27:13.250
Yes, you are.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.916
The summer
that we went to Mohonk, New York.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.250
Ugh. I fished every day in the lake
for two weeks.

27:18.333 --> 27:19.875
I got nothing but a sunburn.

27:19.958 --> 27:21.833
-How do you do that?

27:22.541 --> 27:23.375
Oh, hey.

27:23.458 --> 27:24.916
There he is.

27:25.000 --> 27:28.583
The stinky foul beast,
and he brought his dog.

27:28.666 --> 27:30.791
Oh! John…

27:30.875 --> 27:32.708
Oh, you remember the Goodwins, Fielding?

27:32.791 --> 27:35.041
-Yes! Hi.
-Good to see you again.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.750
You were out for a long time.

27:36.833 --> 27:39.333
Yeah, we stopped at Mr. Platt's
so Gonk could play with Yuri.

27:39.416 --> 27:41.041
It's good for him to play with other dogs.

27:41.125 --> 27:44.333
-Yeah. Well, can I make you a plate?
-Uh, o, thank you.

27:44.416 --> 27:45.291
You never eat.

27:45.375 --> 27:48.000
-He's preparing for a life of poverty.

27:48.625 --> 27:51.041
-Oh! I got him.
-Hey! Hey!

27:51.125 --> 27:52.666
-That's mine.
-He loves pie.

27:53.916 --> 27:56.541
We're gonna do some yoga
before I hit the shower, so…

27:56.625 --> 27:59.458
-It was great seeing you guys.
-Come back and eat, okay?

28:00.625 --> 28:03.166
-You tease him too much.
-I'm just having fun with him.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.666
Must be nice
to have him home.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.041
Mmm.

28:07.541 --> 28:08.583
Yes and no.

28:09.666 --> 28:10.500
Look…

28:10.583 --> 28:14.333
I was broke in college.
I worked my way through with three jobs.

28:14.416 --> 28:16.375
And when I graduated, I had employment.

28:16.958 --> 28:20.541
You know, and when my father was 21,
he'd served in a war.

28:20.625 --> 28:23.000
Yeah, but he
just hasn't found his path yet.

28:23.500 --> 28:26.791
Yeah, well, he better,
'cause I will not be Tim Misner.

28:26.875 --> 28:30.041
His son's 35 years old and just
moved back into the house with them.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.708
It's what keeps me up at night.

28:37.250 --> 28:38.375
My class isn't boring,

28:38.458 --> 28:41.166
and the last question
that I asked on the test was,

28:41.250 --> 28:42.458
"Is atheism a religion?"

28:42.541 --> 28:44.750
-Oh.
-I know. Like, how do you answer that?

28:45.666 --> 28:47.666
You can't. It's not a thing.

28:47.750 --> 28:50.291
So, I just gave everybody an "A"
and watched <i>The Office.</i>

28:50.375 --> 28:52.666
Nice. You know,
the thought of you teaching undergrads,

28:52.750 --> 28:54.166
it's kind of terrifying.

28:54.250 --> 28:55.125
-I know.
-Terrifies me.

28:55.208 --> 28:57.916
-Check that out. A fox.

29:00.125 --> 29:02.333
You see the fox? Go get the fox!

29:07.875 --> 29:09.375
-Zoom!
-There he goes.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.500
See fox, chase fox.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.833
Why can't my life
be as simple as Gonker's?

29:13.916 --> 29:15.041
I know, right?

29:15.750 --> 29:18.125
It's good to see you.
Thank you for driving up.

29:18.208 --> 29:20.791
Yeah. You sounded pretty down
on the phone.

29:23.583 --> 29:26.041
Your dad's just kidding.
I mean, you know that.

29:26.125 --> 29:27.625
Mmm…

29:27.708 --> 29:31.458
Nah. Like, I always knew
he was disappointed in me, but this time…

29:32.000 --> 29:35.041
-I don't know, he just seemed embarrassed.
-He's not. He's not embarrassed.

29:35.125 --> 29:36.458
He's not. He's just…

29:38.041 --> 29:38.875
your dad.

29:38.958 --> 29:39.916
He just doesn't get it.

29:40.000 --> 29:41.791
Like, I'm very well aware
of how lucky I am.

29:41.875 --> 29:43.125
-Right?
-I am.

29:43.208 --> 29:44.583
You know, to have two parents

29:44.666 --> 29:47.000
who busted their asses
to send me to school.

29:47.083 --> 29:48.916
-Yes, they did.
-And gave me every opportunity.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.166
Like, I'm just trying to figure out
what to do with that.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.208
What does that mean?

29:53.041 --> 29:55.791
It's hard to find a career
when you're not good at anything.

29:55.875 --> 29:56.750
You are good at stuff.

29:56.833 --> 29:58.208
-Okay.
-Yes, you are.

29:58.291 --> 30:00.041
It's not like I can get paid for kayaking.

30:00.125 --> 30:02.125
-You might be able to.
-Gonker!

30:02.875 --> 30:03.875
Come here!

30:03.958 --> 30:05.958
Gonker!

30:07.875 --> 30:09.416
He ran fast. Gonker!

30:10.041 --> 30:11.875
Gonky buddy, ya hiding?

30:17.291 --> 30:18.500
Gonker!

30:22.791 --> 30:24.458
Gonker!

30:28.916 --> 30:29.833
Gonk!

30:32.250 --> 30:33.416
Gonker!

30:33.500 --> 30:34.416
Gonk!

30:36.208 --> 30:37.583
Gonker!

30:40.083 --> 30:41.000
Gonker!

30:43.666 --> 30:44.750
Gonker!

30:47.916 --> 30:49.208
Gonker!

30:50.875 --> 30:53.125
Mom! Dad! He's gone!

30:53.208 --> 30:55.583
-What? Who's gone?
-Gonker.

30:55.666 --> 30:58.625
-What happened to your face?
-I fell down a ravine looking for him.

30:58.708 --> 31:00.708
-Where?
-The Appalachian Trail.

31:00.791 --> 31:02.541
He went after a fox
and he never came back.

31:02.625 --> 31:04.416
Nate and I,
we were looking everywhere for him.

31:04.500 --> 31:07.208
-He's somewhere out there right now.
-There are coyotes out there.

31:07.291 --> 31:09.291
-They're gonna eat him alive.
-That's not helpful.

31:09.375 --> 31:12.416
This is why I told you to use a leash!
I knew this would happen!

31:12.500 --> 31:15.458
-When was the last time he had his shot?
-Ten days ago.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.750
So he's got 20 days tops.

31:17.833 --> 31:19.833
Fielding, what is wrong with you?

31:19.916 --> 31:21.750
This is what we're gonna do.

31:21.833 --> 31:25.541
First of all, we're gonna realize
that we're not gonna find him tonight.

31:25.625 --> 31:28.541
Right? You're gonna take a deep breath,
we're gonna clean out this cut

31:28.625 --> 31:30.583
and we're gonna
plan something in the morning.

31:54.625 --> 31:55.541
Mom.

31:56.166 --> 31:58.625
Please. It's so cold out.

31:58.708 --> 32:02.291
He's fine. He has a fur coat.
I don't have a fur coat.

32:02.375 --> 32:04.041
He's been out there for hours.

32:04.125 --> 32:07.916
I am not letting that bear of a dog
inside while I entertain.

32:08.583 --> 32:11.916
Now go to your room and be quiet
or you'll find yourself outside with him.

32:20.041 --> 32:21.250
Come on, boy.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.500
Come on, let's go.

32:47.041 --> 32:48.416
Nice and warm.

32:51.416 --> 32:53.541
You're my best friend, Oji.

33:06.208 --> 33:07.416
It's insane.

33:07.916 --> 33:09.541
A 2,200-mile trail

33:09.625 --> 33:12.625
and the parks department
only has two rangers assigned to it.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.125
What's going on?

33:14.833 --> 33:17.791
Oh, the library gave us phone books
for every county in Virginia.

33:17.875 --> 33:19.791
-At least I think it's every one.
-Why?

33:20.291 --> 33:21.416
Because I'm analog.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.083
And if I search online,
I'm just gonna print it all out anyway.

33:24.166 --> 33:27.083
That's hundreds of loose pages.
This way, it's easier to manage.

33:27.166 --> 33:28.833
No, why are you doing this?

33:28.916 --> 33:30.541
Because we have to find Gonker.

33:30.625 --> 33:32.541
So we should start
with pounds, obviously.

33:32.625 --> 33:33.833
-Animal hospitals.
-Yeah. Right.

33:33.916 --> 33:37.208
And let's do Rockbridge, Rockingham.

33:37.291 --> 33:38.958
-And Augusta.
-Okay.

33:39.041 --> 33:41.375
Also, every town,
we should talk to the police department.

33:41.458 --> 33:42.958
-Yes.
-Talk to animal control.

33:43.041 --> 33:44.708
We should talk to, uh, churches.

33:44.791 --> 33:47.333
Anywhere people congregate
and go for information.

33:48.000 --> 33:49.750
Yeah, local newspapers.

33:49.833 --> 33:50.791
-VFW halls.
-Yes.

33:50.875 --> 33:52.916
Rotary Clubs, Elk Lodges.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.083
You're talking hundreds of places.

33:55.166 --> 33:56.750
Yeah. You have a better idea?

33:56.833 --> 33:58.000
No.

33:58.083 --> 34:00.166
Well, there's no other alternative.

34:00.250 --> 34:02.791
I'm gonna stay here
and I'll work the phones, take out ads.

34:02.875 --> 34:05.541
Ads? Don't you think
social media is more effective?

34:05.625 --> 34:07.416
I don't do that stuff.
That's your department.

34:07.500 --> 34:08.833
And search and rescue.

34:08.916 --> 34:11.875
Your mom's gonna hold down
the command center here, but you and I

34:12.375 --> 34:14.208
are hitting the Appalachian Trail.

34:14.291 --> 34:16.541
So if we focus, we work hard,

34:17.041 --> 34:19.000
and make calculated, deliberate decisions,

34:19.083 --> 34:21.333
and I promise you, we will find that dog.

34:21.833 --> 34:24.208
Right? Hurry up, get dressed.
We only have so much daylight.

34:24.291 --> 34:25.208
Okay.

34:27.250 --> 34:29.750
You promise? How can you say that?

34:30.875 --> 34:31.958
Because I believe it.

34:53.291 --> 34:55.000
It's been over an hour driving.

34:55.083 --> 34:58.083
Should I be prepared
for it to be this quiet the whole time?

34:59.083 --> 35:01.958
I'm checking to see
if Gonker's word is getting out.

35:02.041 --> 35:02.958
How's it going?

35:03.791 --> 35:07.333
Just friends saying they hope we find him,
but nothing useful.

35:09.416 --> 35:12.166
Can we play something
with a little more pep?

35:13.083 --> 35:14.625
I'm not feeling peppy.

35:16.333 --> 35:17.750
This whole thing's my fault.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.458
Thanks for doing this.

35:24.375 --> 35:26.250
We haven't accomplished anything yet.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.750
Caesar never thanked his generals
until they delivered a victory.

35:30.833 --> 35:31.833
I'm not Caesar.

35:32.458 --> 35:33.375
No, you're not.

35:34.875 --> 35:36.833
But you're trying to solve this situation.

35:39.208 --> 35:40.125
That's a start.

36:26.250 --> 36:29.833
If you want to find him,
you need to find him.

36:30.708 --> 36:32.375
Have you found Jesus Christ?

36:32.458 --> 36:34.083
Well, we're a member of the church.

36:34.166 --> 36:36.083
We probably don't go
as often as we should.

36:37.541 --> 36:39.458
-You're selling those?
-Best in the county.

36:39.958 --> 36:41.916
I've got the perfect one for ya.

36:51.916 --> 36:55.041
Saint Anthony
is the patron saint of lost souls.

36:55.125 --> 36:57.291
He'll help bring Gonker's soul
back to you.

36:58.625 --> 36:59.541
Let us pray.

37:01.000 --> 37:05.250
Saint Anthony, guide these men
as they search for their beloved hound.

37:06.208 --> 37:07.041
Amen.

37:08.250 --> 37:09.083
Amen.

37:09.666 --> 37:12.208
Um, well, here's a ten.

37:12.291 --> 37:14.833
Five for the figurine
and five for the prayer.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.500
Appreciate you.

37:16.583 --> 37:17.833
Same to you, brother.

37:31.083 --> 37:31.916
Can't hurt.

37:35.708 --> 37:38.666
And his collar
is blue and white herringbone.

37:38.750 --> 37:41.750
<i>I'm real sorry, but none</i>
<i>of our dogs match that description.</i>

37:42.250 --> 37:46.000
Okay. Well, maybe could you just
put up a flyer in the office?

37:46.083 --> 37:46.916
Can do.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.375
And I'll make a bunch of copies

37:48.458 --> 37:51.333
and have our shelter volunteers
pass them out around town.

37:51.416 --> 37:53.291
Jerry Malcolm.

37:54.625 --> 37:57.625
Thank you so much.
We're so appreciative of your kindness.

37:57.708 --> 37:59.708
-You have a great day.
<i>You too.</i>

37:59.791 --> 38:01.333
-Good luck, now.
-<i>Thank you.</i>

38:13.333 --> 38:15.541
Gonker!

38:16.791 --> 38:19.041
Gonker!

38:20.916 --> 38:23.375
Gonker! Gonker! Gonker!

38:23.458 --> 38:25.583
Dad, Dad, you're not a French ambulance.

38:26.166 --> 38:29.166
Oh, I'm sorry.
I would hate for me to embarrass you.

38:29.250 --> 38:31.583
-At least you admit it.
-Admit what?

38:31.666 --> 38:34.125
-That you're embarrassed of me.
-Don't be ridiculous.

38:34.625 --> 38:36.458
Am I being ridiculous?

38:38.208 --> 38:41.500
Because what's the opposite
of embarrassment? It's pride.

38:41.583 --> 38:44.916
So, can you say you're proud
of how I live my life?

38:45.875 --> 38:49.125
You know, from my ripped jeans
to my choices and everything in between.

38:49.208 --> 38:52.958
Well, Fielding, obviously,
there are decisions that you've made,

38:53.041 --> 38:54.666
how you spent your time in college,

38:54.750 --> 38:57.875
how you're spending your time now,
that I don't… I don't agree with.

38:57.958 --> 39:02.000
-And, frankly, I don't understand them--
-I guess we're just two different people.

39:02.083 --> 39:04.791
-Let me finish what I'm saying.
-There's no point, you know?

39:04.875 --> 39:07.958
'Cause I know that you think
that I'm irresponsible, and immature,

39:08.041 --> 39:10.166
and, you know,
Gonker's gonna die 'cause of me.

39:10.250 --> 39:11.958
-Fielding.
-There's hikers coming.

39:15.291 --> 39:17.291
Um, hi! Excuse me.

39:17.833 --> 39:20.625
I'm looking for my dog.
Just wondering if you've seen him.

39:20.708 --> 39:23.125
Or maybe you can help
spread the word if not.

39:23.208 --> 39:24.666
Yes, hi. This is Ginny Marshall.

39:24.750 --> 39:28.666
I just emailed you a note with a flyer
explaining my family's situation and--

39:29.166 --> 39:31.125
That's call waiting. I'll try you back.

39:31.833 --> 39:33.208
-John?
-Ms. Marshall.

39:33.708 --> 39:35.833
This is Kyle Gans at the <i>Virginia Sun.</i>

39:36.333 --> 39:37.333
I got your email.

39:37.416 --> 39:40.666
Oh! Thank you for calling back
so quickly, Mr. Gans. Yes.

39:40.750 --> 39:41.625
Um…

39:41.708 --> 39:45.875
I was wondering if we could put
a, um, a lost dog ad in your paper.

39:45.958 --> 39:48.416
<i>I'd be happy to reimburse you</i>
<i>for any expenses.</i>

39:48.500 --> 39:51.208
Actually,
I'm thinking of something bigger.

39:52.083 --> 39:53.666
I was struck by what you wrote.

39:54.750 --> 39:57.000
It was deeply personal.

39:57.625 --> 39:59.500
You're clearly heartbroken over your dog.

39:59.583 --> 40:03.875
Oh, well, yeah, I…
I did write the note, but, actually,

40:03.958 --> 40:05.750
<i>Gonker belongs to my son.</i>

40:07.041 --> 40:07.875
Really?

40:08.916 --> 40:10.791
Because it reads like you lost your dog.

40:14.291 --> 40:15.833
<i>Anyway, with your permission,</i>

40:16.625 --> 40:18.750
I'd like to write an article
about your search.

40:19.333 --> 40:20.166
What?

40:23.375 --> 40:24.625
<i>We're getting publicity.</i>

40:24.708 --> 40:28.125
<i>-The newspaper's gonna run an article.</i>
-An article? Really?

40:28.208 --> 40:30.583
With a photo of Gonker and everything.

40:30.666 --> 40:33.291
The Connor boys are here,
they're setting up a scanner for me,

40:33.375 --> 40:35.958
'cause the newspaper said
we need a certain resolution or something.

40:36.041 --> 40:38.458
I don't know. I called Janie
and she sent 'em right over.

40:38.541 --> 40:40.333
Great. Make sure you give 'em both a 20.

40:40.416 --> 40:42.750
Yeah, I already tried.
They refused.

40:42.833 --> 40:43.875
Isn't this wonderful?

40:43.958 --> 40:47.083
The <i>Virginia Sun </i>has a circulation
of, like, 6,000.

40:47.166 --> 40:49.083
I mean, Gonker has been
retweeted double that.

40:49.166 --> 40:50.500
We still haven't heard anything.

40:50.583 --> 40:53.166
Well, every little bit counts, right?

40:53.250 --> 40:54.875
All right. Well, keep up the good work.

40:54.958 --> 40:57.333
<i>We love you. We'll call you</i>
<i>from the road in the morning.</i>

40:57.833 --> 40:59.375
Okay. Love you too.

41:36.208 --> 41:38.125
We did 14 miles today.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.041
I need you to keep up your energy.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.875
-I know you're upset, but--
-I'm not upset, Dad.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.333
It's…

41:47.500 --> 41:48.375
It's what?

41:54.583 --> 41:55.625
All my friends,

41:56.708 --> 41:59.375
okay, they've all gone
and started their lives, and

42:00.166 --> 42:01.291
I'm happy for them.

42:03.041 --> 42:05.041
But it's like they pity me.

42:06.208 --> 42:09.208
I totally feel it. And you and Mom,
you guys judge me too.

42:09.791 --> 42:13.041
-Fielding, your mom and I don't judge you.
-Dad, yes, you do. Every day.

42:13.125 --> 42:14.250
In how you look at me.

42:15.875 --> 42:18.875
How you talk about me
when you think I can't hear you.

42:20.791 --> 42:24.541
And when all of your friends, and your
mom, and your dad, and their friends,

42:24.625 --> 42:27.708
when everyone
looks at you like you're a loser, it's…

42:27.791 --> 42:29.750
It's nice to have

42:29.833 --> 42:32.958
one soul on earth who thinks
you're fine just the way you are.

42:34.375 --> 42:36.000
Even if you are a little bit different

42:36.083 --> 42:38.958
or don't have a job,
or direction, or momentum.

42:40.125 --> 42:43.500
Just one soul who loves you because…

42:44.416 --> 42:45.416
Because you are you.

42:47.750 --> 42:49.666
That's who Gonker was for me, Dad.

42:51.833 --> 42:54.541
Gonker was the only one
on the entire planet who…

42:55.041 --> 42:57.291
Who liked me just the way I am.

43:02.166 --> 43:05.750
Son, you're worried about Gonker
because you love him and he's lost.

43:07.875 --> 43:09.625
That's why I worry about you.

43:10.458 --> 43:11.583
You just did it again.

43:15.791 --> 43:19.416
Just because I'm trying to find my way
or whatever doesn't mean I'm lost.

43:39.250 --> 43:42.458
Excuse me! Excuse me! Hi.

43:42.541 --> 43:43.375
Hi.

43:43.458 --> 43:46.791
Hi, um, were you handing these out
in the Hardee's earlier?

43:46.875 --> 43:48.541
Yeah. Have you seen him?

43:49.375 --> 43:51.208
Uh, no, sweetie, I haven't,

43:51.291 --> 43:54.000
but when my Tucker ran off
a few years ago,

43:54.083 --> 43:57.750
we went around with his brother Butchie,
and Tucker picked up his scent real fast.

43:57.833 --> 44:00.625
Some folks think dogs will pick up
the scent of another canine

44:00.708 --> 44:02.625
before they will a human scent.

44:02.708 --> 44:06.000
It's kinda left over
from when they needed to find their packs.

44:06.083 --> 44:07.916
I thought maybe it could help.

44:08.541 --> 44:09.750
Thank you.

44:27.250 --> 44:30.500
-Hey, we really appreciate this.
-Ah, you kiddin'?

44:30.583 --> 44:35.791
Yuri loves Gonker, and vice versa.
No doubt old Gonk will know his scent.

44:35.875 --> 44:38.041
I promise he'll never be off leash,

44:38.125 --> 44:40.875
and we'll feed him well,
get plenty of exercise.

44:40.958 --> 44:42.583
Fresh air will do him good.

44:42.666 --> 44:45.708
Need him back a week from today.
Heading to Florida till the spring.

44:45.791 --> 44:48.083
You got it.
Hopefully, we'll be back with two dogs.

44:48.166 --> 44:52.125
All right. You be good, Yuri.
Help the Marshalls find their boy.

45:00.625 --> 45:01.541
Gonk!

45:02.541 --> 45:03.541
Gonker!

45:06.541 --> 45:07.583
Gonker!

45:08.833 --> 45:10.375
Gonker!

45:13.333 --> 45:14.291
Gonk!

45:14.875 --> 45:16.875
-Hey, excuse me.
-Hey, how are ya?

45:16.958 --> 45:19.583
We're looking for our dog.
Maybe you can help us.

45:19.666 --> 45:21.750
-Seen anything around here?
-No, haven't seen anything.

45:22.333 --> 45:24.041
-Thank you so much.
-Good luck.

45:25.250 --> 45:28.291
-Gonker!

45:30.208 --> 45:32.666
Gonker!

45:34.875 --> 45:36.750
Gonker!

45:38.375 --> 45:39.875
Gonker!

45:39.958 --> 45:40.958
Gonker!

45:42.291 --> 45:44.833
Gonker!

45:44.916 --> 45:46.166
I'd love to help.

45:46.250 --> 45:49.041
I have a friend at the high school,
lets me make copies for free.

45:49.125 --> 45:51.208
I can put one up at the church,
the market.

45:51.791 --> 45:53.791
Oh, and the quarry
employs a whole lot of folk.

45:53.875 --> 45:56.666
I'll make sure they find one
on their windshield after work.

45:56.750 --> 46:00.291
-Thank you. You're a godsend.
-Tell my ex that. Good luck.

46:00.375 --> 46:02.416
-What about those guys?

46:03.666 --> 46:06.666
-Are you sure?
-Talk about covering a lot of ground.

46:07.625 --> 46:10.583
Right. They're on motorcycles.
They can't ride the trail.

46:10.666 --> 46:12.625
We don't know
if Gonker's gonna stay on the trail.

46:12.708 --> 46:14.166
-He could head into a city.
-Okay.

46:14.250 --> 46:16.208
But they just don't
look like the type of people

46:16.291 --> 46:18.791
you approach about this kind of thing.

46:18.875 --> 46:22.750
Son, if you live in a bubble,
eventually you suffocate.

46:35.500 --> 46:38.083
Pardon the interruption.
I was wondering if any of you gentlemen

46:38.166 --> 46:42.250
had, uh, possibly seen
our missing dog on your travels?

46:42.958 --> 46:45.166
He disappeared two days ago
on the trail, um,

46:45.250 --> 46:50.041
and if we don't find him within 18 days
and give him his medicine, he could die.

46:50.125 --> 46:51.625
His name is Gonker.

46:52.875 --> 46:55.416
-His name is "Gonkers"?
-"Gonker." Singular.

46:56.250 --> 46:57.791
It's one dog.

47:00.708 --> 47:01.708
Gon-ker.

47:02.750 --> 47:04.125
That's a stupid name.

47:07.458 --> 47:09.625
I gave my dog a stupid name once.

47:11.666 --> 47:12.833
"Macaroni."

47:14.500 --> 47:15.458
Yeah.

47:16.208 --> 47:18.291
He was five when he got out of the yard.

47:19.791 --> 47:20.916
Never came back.

47:23.791 --> 47:25.208
I still dream about him.

47:26.708 --> 47:29.166
What happened to your guy?
How'd he get lost?

47:30.166 --> 47:31.000
Um…

47:31.875 --> 47:33.625
I had him off the leash, so…

47:34.416 --> 47:35.500
Uh, it's my fault.

47:43.791 --> 47:45.583
You need to forgive yourself.

47:46.541 --> 47:49.458
I beat myself up for years
on account of Macaroni.

47:50.833 --> 47:52.041
It does you no good.

47:52.916 --> 47:54.791
And it does no good for Gonkers either.

47:54.875 --> 47:55.750
Gonker.

47:59.208 --> 48:01.291
We've got chapters up and down the coast.

48:02.291 --> 48:05.541
And we'll make sure that every
Asrael’s Knight keeps their eyes peeled.

48:06.916 --> 48:08.541
-Oh.
-Thank you.

48:09.750 --> 48:11.375
And thank all the other knights.

48:11.458 --> 48:13.541
Uh, yeah, thanks.

48:21.958 --> 48:25.125
No dogs.
Next motel is over 30 miles away,

48:25.208 --> 48:28.458
and their website says,
"No pets over 15 pounds."

48:28.958 --> 48:31.875
All right, let's put his bowls
in your bag.

48:32.750 --> 48:34.375
No, they said, "No dogs."

48:34.458 --> 48:36.666
Yeah. Little laws are for little men.

48:37.250 --> 48:39.375
-The fine is, like, $300.
-Come on.

48:41.333 --> 48:43.208
Ancient trading caravans on the Silk Road

48:43.291 --> 48:45.458
would stop at campgrounds
on their way to the Orient.

48:45.541 --> 48:46.791
You know what they called those?

48:46.875 --> 48:49.041
Holiday Inns that don't allow dogs?

48:49.125 --> 48:50.333
"Caravansaries."

48:50.416 --> 48:52.666
Not only were there camels allowed inside,

48:53.166 --> 48:55.875
the guards would welcome them
and protect them.

48:55.958 --> 48:57.333
-Oh.
-We are a caravansary.

48:57.416 --> 48:59.625
So they are required to welcome our camp.

48:59.708 --> 49:01.083
Come on. Okay.

49:01.166 --> 49:03.625
-Put the coat around me.

49:03.708 --> 49:06.541
-What is this, <i>Scooby-Doo?</i>
-Come on, come on! He's heavy.

49:10.958 --> 49:13.625
Okay, I'm gonna distract the front desk
while you slip by,

49:13.708 --> 49:15.375
and I'll meet you at the elevators.

49:15.458 --> 49:16.666
Let's light this candle.

49:19.166 --> 49:20.666
I am not paying the fine.

49:20.750 --> 49:23.125
Of course not. You'd need money for that.

49:25.875 --> 49:26.875
Hello.

49:26.958 --> 49:28.750
<i>Your dog is with a bad man.</i>

49:30.541 --> 49:31.375
Who is this?

49:31.458 --> 49:34.416
<i>My neighbor Claude got him.</i>
<i>He got all kinds of animals.</i>

49:34.500 --> 49:36.500
<i>Lord knows what he does to them.</i>

49:36.583 --> 49:40.625
<i>I see lots of dogs get brought in,</i>
<i>but I ain't ever seen one come out.</i>

49:40.708 --> 49:43.583
I don't understand.
She says this guy's harming animals?

49:43.666 --> 49:45.916
That's what she said.
We should call the police.

49:46.000 --> 49:47.333
<i>And tell them what?</i>

49:47.416 --> 49:49.750
They can't enter the guy's house
on an accusation.

49:49.833 --> 49:53.375
They'd need probable cause for a warrant
and there's not enough to get one.

49:54.791 --> 49:56.875
Intro to Constitutional Law, B-plus.

49:56.958 --> 50:00.750
Look, we'll have a conversation
with the guy and we'll see what's what.

50:00.833 --> 50:03.458
-Do we have an address?
<i>I just texted it to Fielding.</i>

50:03.541 --> 50:06.333
Oh, also, Fields,
um, I need you to get the word out

50:06.416 --> 50:08.833
on my new Twitter and Instagram handles.

50:08.916 --> 50:12.708
It's, um, @RealGonker and @FindGonker.

50:12.791 --> 50:15.291
Hey, you guys be careful
at this Claude fella's.

50:15.375 --> 50:16.958
He might be some kinda serial killer.

50:17.041 --> 50:20.583
Yeah, you're absolutely right. That's why
I'm gonna send Fielding to the front door.

50:20.666 --> 50:22.291
<i>Great.</i>

50:22.375 --> 50:23.833
Be safe. I'm serious.

50:24.416 --> 50:25.250
Bye.

50:25.333 --> 50:27.166
All my paperwork's up-to-date.

50:27.250 --> 50:30.916
I'm fully licensed to act as a non-profit,
temporary shelter for strays.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.708
I'm sorry. My wife called me
and said I should check it out.

50:33.791 --> 50:34.791
I don't know.

50:34.875 --> 50:37.083
It's… No, this isn't
the first time it's happened.

50:37.166 --> 50:41.333
The woman who called, Mrs. Banner,
98 and, uh, losing her faculties.

50:41.416 --> 50:45.000
It's been explained to her a dozen times
what we do, but she just forgets.

50:45.083 --> 50:47.000
-But her heart's in the right place.
-Sure.

50:47.083 --> 50:50.041
-Listen, we're sorry to take up your time.
-You're not taking up my time.

50:50.125 --> 50:54.083
Look, I'm fully plugged in
to the animal rescue community.

50:54.166 --> 50:55.375
I'm gonna scan this, okay?

50:55.458 --> 50:56.750
I'm gonna get a chain going.

50:56.833 --> 51:00.958
We have folks, they spend every weekend
searching for strays just to try and help.

51:01.041 --> 51:02.708
They need to know about Gonker.

51:02.791 --> 51:03.916
Well, thank you.

51:04.000 --> 51:05.000
Yeah, thanks.

51:05.083 --> 51:06.041
You okay?

51:06.625 --> 51:08.000
Oh, yeah, I just…

51:08.958 --> 51:10.916
I was hoping he'd be here, but…

51:11.500 --> 51:12.958
Let's just hope for a miracle.

51:43.250 --> 51:46.083
-Ah, good! You got some calories in you.
-Mmm.

51:46.166 --> 51:48.541
Mmm-hmm! Um…

51:48.625 --> 51:53.208
So, I was thinking today
we make our way down to Elkton.

51:53.291 --> 51:54.375
Elkton.

51:55.166 --> 51:57.833
-That's quite a ways.
-Well, we don't have a choice.

51:57.916 --> 51:59.875
It's like we say, Gonker isn't any dog.

52:01.458 --> 52:03.916
As hard as you're searching for him,
he's searching for you.

52:05.416 --> 52:07.625
Hi. Um, so sorry to bother you.

52:08.208 --> 52:11.125
I was wondering,
maybe, if you've seen this dog?

52:11.208 --> 52:13.375
Well, we sure have, 'cause he's our dog.

52:13.458 --> 52:15.625
Hold on. You're the Marshalls?

52:15.708 --> 52:17.625
That's what the mailbox says. And you are?

52:17.708 --> 52:18.666
Um, Tracy.

52:18.750 --> 52:20.125
I can't believe this.

52:20.208 --> 52:24.541
I just read about you guys yesterday,
and it just made me feel so sad.

52:24.625 --> 52:26.958
So I made a bunch of these
to hand out while I hike.

52:27.041 --> 52:28.541
That is incredibly nice of you.

52:28.625 --> 52:32.125
Wow, I guess the <i>Virginia Sun</i>
did us a solid.

52:32.208 --> 52:35.291
The <i>Sun</i>? No, I've read about this
in <i>Roanoke Times.</i>

52:35.375 --> 52:37.583
-Can I see that flyer?
-Yeah, of course.

52:40.291 --> 52:42.333
Ha! This is from the Associated Press.

52:42.416 --> 52:43.875
Gonker's gone national.

52:44.875 --> 52:48.375
-Hello, this is Ginny Marshall.
-Ginny, my name is Alex Olsen.

52:48.458 --> 52:51.458
I saw the article about your dog
in the <i>Duluth News Tribune.</i>

52:52.041 --> 52:54.166
I got a Saint Bernard
with Addison's disease.

52:54.750 --> 52:56.375
<i>I just wanted to let you know</i>

52:56.458 --> 52:58.583
there's certain foods
that you can leave out for Gonker,

52:58.666 --> 53:01.000
that if he can get to 'em,
which might help his condition.

53:01.083 --> 53:03.333
<i>Give him a few extra days</i>
<i>before his medicine wears off.</i>

53:06.541 --> 53:08.791
-Hello, this is Ginny Marshall.

53:08.875 --> 53:10.750
Uh, can you just say that one more time?

53:10.833 --> 53:12.416
Rhodesian.

53:13.000 --> 53:14.291
Rhodesian Ridgeback.

53:14.375 --> 53:15.875
<i>They are excellent trackers.</i>

53:15.958 --> 53:19.833
<i>But when he goes out to hunt, I have</i>
<i>a method to help him find his way home.</i>

53:19.916 --> 53:22.666
<i>Take anything you might have</i>
<i>with your son's scent on it.</i>

53:22.750 --> 53:24.291
<i>Place it outside.</i>

53:24.375 --> 53:26.708
<i>The scent can carry for up to ten miles.</i>

53:29.375 --> 53:30.875
I can't keep up with all the calls.

53:30.958 --> 53:34.208
People are reaching out from all over
the world with tips on how to track him,

53:34.291 --> 53:37.250
how to lure him out of the woods,
how to help him find your scent.

53:37.333 --> 53:39.708
Well, I don't think
they're gonna need help with that.

53:39.791 --> 53:40.625
Meaning?

53:41.500 --> 53:44.166
You're working on kind of a…
patchouli musk.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.208
-Have you smelled your cologne?
-Aw.

53:47.291 --> 53:50.333
-Sounds like you two are getting along.
-Oh, no, it's Stockholm syndrome.

53:50.416 --> 53:53.083
Anyway, I put everyone's tips together
in a Google doc,

53:53.166 --> 53:55.666
and I just shared it with you.
I sent you a link.

53:55.750 --> 53:58.416
I recognize your voice,
but you cannot possibly be my mom.

53:58.500 --> 54:00.583
Ha-ha. Very funny.

54:00.666 --> 54:03.833
-Gonker!

54:05.458 --> 54:06.500
Gonker!

54:16.750 --> 54:19.625
-Man, this is beautiful country.
-Oh, I know.

54:20.916 --> 54:23.958
I took the youth center kids
on the trail a few times.

54:24.958 --> 54:26.041
Like, to a stream.

54:26.625 --> 54:27.583
Kayaked all day.

54:29.875 --> 54:32.000
-They loved it.
-Sounds like you did too.

54:32.791 --> 54:33.625
Yeah.

54:41.208 --> 54:42.208
So you…

54:42.291 --> 54:45.916
You might think this is,
like, dumb or whatever, but, um…

54:48.416 --> 54:51.750
I was thinking about maybe
one day working in that field.

54:53.958 --> 54:55.000
Doing what?

54:55.083 --> 54:56.291
Uh, you know, like,

54:57.333 --> 55:00.166
outdoor tours, nature tours,
stuff like that.

55:01.041 --> 55:02.375
Is there a living in that?

55:04.125 --> 55:05.375
I don't know.

55:07.791 --> 55:08.875
Just a thought.

55:08.958 --> 55:09.791
Ow.

55:14.333 --> 55:15.166
Hey!

55:16.250 --> 55:17.333
Hey, you okay?

55:20.333 --> 55:22.125
Oh, yeah, it's just some blisters.

55:22.208 --> 55:25.250
Look, we're a half mile from a rest stop.
Why don't we take a break?

55:27.458 --> 55:30.500
No, we should keep going.
He's only got two weeks.

55:30.583 --> 55:32.750
All the more reason
you gotta stay healthy.

55:33.250 --> 55:35.958
We've got a lot of ground to cover.
Come on.

55:49.166 --> 55:51.833
Hey. We should
definitely check in with those guys.

55:52.500 --> 55:55.833
Yeah, I have flyers, and I can recite
the story in my sleep, so…

56:01.291 --> 56:02.125
Are you coming?

56:02.208 --> 56:04.750
Thought I'd let you handle it.
Look like your kind of people.

56:05.916 --> 56:08.416
If you live in a bubble,
you eventually suffocate.

56:10.333 --> 56:11.416
Now he listens to me.

56:22.083 --> 56:23.208
You're gonna hyperventilate.

56:23.708 --> 56:25.625
See, you got the wrong stuff in there.

56:26.250 --> 56:29.166
If the kindling bends like this,
it's too wet.

56:30.541 --> 56:31.875
Unless it breaks,

56:33.250 --> 56:34.208
it doesn't burn.

56:34.916 --> 56:36.000
So you need

56:37.708 --> 56:38.958
more stuff like this.

56:42.416 --> 56:43.416
See, now…

56:45.791 --> 56:48.583
-Yeah, that's kindling.
-Wow.

56:48.666 --> 56:52.583
-You're, like, full of dad knowledge.
-Ha! I don't know about that.

56:52.666 --> 56:54.666
Talk to my son,
he'll tell you I'm full of something.

56:56.208 --> 56:58.375
-He's pretty awesome.
-Fielding?

56:58.458 --> 56:59.666
Yeah, man.

56:59.750 --> 57:02.916
Going out on the open road,
searching for his best friend.

57:03.000 --> 57:05.375
He's got a real loving energy
that's hard to come by.

57:05.458 --> 57:07.708
It's like you two are on,
like, an epic journey together.

57:07.791 --> 57:08.750
Like a quest.

57:08.833 --> 57:10.375
-An epic quest.
-Yo.

57:10.458 --> 57:12.666
A vision quest, like the movie.

57:14.500 --> 57:16.250
Matthew Modine, Madonna,

57:16.333 --> 57:19.208
singing in a Pennsylvania
Appalachian bar? No?

57:21.500 --> 57:23.833
That's what makes
what you're doing so cool.

57:24.333 --> 57:26.750
Not many dads
would walk the trail for their kid.

57:26.833 --> 57:30.750
Yeah. I mean, my old man,
he thinks everything I do is stupid,

57:30.833 --> 57:34.250
like writing my music, or making my plays.

57:34.333 --> 57:36.916
No, he doesn't think you're stupid.
He loves you.

57:37.583 --> 57:40.583
Writing your plays and making your music
isn't gonna pay the bills.

57:40.666 --> 57:43.375
You know, or get you health care coverage,
so he worries.

57:43.458 --> 57:45.000
That's what dads do, they…

57:45.916 --> 57:46.875
We worry.

57:48.458 --> 57:51.625
Mr. Marshall, we were all born in 2000.

57:52.291 --> 57:54.375
The first humans of the new millennium.

57:54.458 --> 57:56.041
With technological advances,

57:56.125 --> 57:59.250
the odds are greater
we'll live past 100 than die before 40.

57:59.333 --> 58:01.458
So what's the difference
if on our deathbed,

58:01.541 --> 58:04.541
we had 54 years in the workforce or 53?

58:04.625 --> 58:06.791
If we die with a little less money
to leave our kids

58:06.875 --> 58:09.875
but a lot more life experience
and knowledge to pass on?

58:10.708 --> 58:14.916
Some people know exactly what they want.
And others don't, like me and my friends.

58:15.750 --> 58:18.375
At the end of the day,
we're all just walking the trail.

58:18.458 --> 58:23.375
It's just some of us wanna
wait a bit longer before we step off.

58:23.458 --> 58:24.416
That's all.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.916
You know, I think my son's been
trying to tell me his version of that,

58:30.000 --> 58:31.583
like, half a dozen times, and…

58:33.083 --> 58:34.833
Don't know why I didn't hear it until now.

58:36.583 --> 58:37.750
'Cause I'm not your son.

58:44.208 --> 58:46.166
All right. This was a good day.

58:47.125 --> 58:49.291
Just another day
with no dog to show for it.

58:50.166 --> 58:53.166
Well, people who don't even know us
now know Gonker.

58:53.250 --> 58:57.583
And the dog can only travel so far,
and the story is now outpacing him.

58:57.666 --> 59:00.125
So it's a good thing. Believe me.

59:03.166 --> 59:05.208
-Really? Again?

59:08.041 --> 59:09.291
Really? All right.

59:13.041 --> 59:15.416
This is why I haven't been able
to get much rest.

59:15.500 --> 59:18.916
I'm so used to Gonker being
in bed with me, I can't sleep without him.

59:19.000 --> 59:22.500
-Yeah, Well, you're welcome to this one.
-Oh, no, I think he likes you.

59:24.750 --> 59:26.083
He just won't stop moving.

59:28.375 --> 59:29.250
Can you stop?

59:32.250 --> 59:33.541
See if we can pull this off.

59:34.791 --> 59:36.541
Remember, today was a good day.

1:00:31.541 --> 1:00:32.916
It's okay, boy.

1:00:34.833 --> 1:00:35.791
I'm okay.

1:00:46.500 --> 1:00:48.750
Oh! Thanks for all your help, Yuri.

1:00:49.250 --> 1:00:51.083
-So you have enough water?
-Yep.

1:00:51.166 --> 1:00:52.833
-Food?
-PowerBars and beef jerky.

1:00:52.916 --> 1:00:54.958
-You actually gonna eat any of it?
-Yes.

1:00:55.041 --> 1:00:57.541
Good. 'Cause take this in the spirit
with which it's intended,

1:00:57.625 --> 1:00:58.958
but you look like a bag of crap.

1:00:59.041 --> 1:01:01.875
-Thank you very much.
-So you'll take Spotswood up to--

1:01:01.958 --> 1:01:03.333
-To the main trail.
-That's right.

1:01:03.416 --> 1:01:06.291
-And I'll meet you in the parking lot at--
-Browns Gap. Got it.

1:01:06.375 --> 1:01:09.666
It should take you about ten hours
of walking, and I'll see you tonight.

1:01:09.750 --> 1:01:11.583
-Be safe.
-I'll be fine. Promise.

1:01:14.333 --> 1:01:15.791
-See ya.

1:01:16.958 --> 1:01:17.875
Be good.

1:01:36.375 --> 1:01:37.583
<i>Oji?</i>

1:01:41.625 --> 1:01:42.791
Oji?

1:01:46.916 --> 1:01:48.208
Oji?

1:01:58.333 --> 1:01:59.166
Where's Oji?

1:02:03.583 --> 1:02:05.625
I need you to be a big girl about this.

1:02:06.708 --> 1:02:09.416
Oji got loose this morning
and ran into Fulton.

1:02:09.500 --> 1:02:11.041
He was struck by a car.

1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.083
He didn't make it.

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:20.833
I'm sorry. I know you liked him,
but these things are a part of life.

1:02:21.625 --> 1:02:25.375
Now, I told your father you would
likely make a big thing about this.

1:02:25.458 --> 1:02:26.541
Prove me wrong.

1:02:26.625 --> 1:02:28.375
Show us that you won't carry on

1:02:28.458 --> 1:02:32.125
and you will be rewarded with
a day of shopping at Josie's Boutique.

1:02:32.625 --> 1:02:35.041
'Cause the truth is, no amount of crying
will bring him back.

1:02:35.125 --> 1:02:37.583
So why waste that energy, okay?

1:03:05.500 --> 1:03:07.166
-Oh.
-Ooh.

1:03:07.250 --> 1:03:09.375
-Oh, gosh, you scared me.

1:03:09.458 --> 1:03:10.583
I missed you.

1:03:10.666 --> 1:03:12.875
-I missed you too. What a week.
-Mmm-hmm.

1:03:14.208 --> 1:03:15.791
So Yuri's back with Earl,

1:03:15.875 --> 1:03:20.500
and I am so looking forward to a shower
with a regular-sized bar of soap.

1:03:20.583 --> 1:03:21.541
Ugh, I bet.

1:03:24.041 --> 1:03:27.125
I don't think I've seen a room like this
since Russell Crowe was doing math.

1:03:27.208 --> 1:03:29.166
Yeah, I've been listening to a podcast

1:03:29.250 --> 1:03:32.166
of the Bushmen in the Kalahari
and how they track antelope,

1:03:32.250 --> 1:03:35.791
and I was thinking there could be
something to that that's applicable here.

1:03:35.875 --> 1:03:36.958
-Sure.
-Yeah.

1:03:37.041 --> 1:03:38.666
And also I've been putting up trackers

1:03:38.750 --> 1:03:41.666
where everybody said that they've
seen Oji, but the description was wrong,

1:03:41.750 --> 1:03:44.875
but I figure maybe if there's a pattern
to his movements, we should follow up.

1:03:44.958 --> 1:03:47.416
Because who knows, maybe every tipster
just described him wrong.

1:03:47.500 --> 1:03:48.541
Yeah, no, that makes sense.

1:03:48.625 --> 1:03:51.916
Yeah, and then there's one other thing.
And you're gonna think I'm crazy.

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.375
-Animal psychics.
-Okay.

1:03:53.916 --> 1:03:55.750
-What?
-No, I'm worried about you.

1:03:56.708 --> 1:03:59.208
I'm fine! There's just
a lot of information coming in,

1:03:59.291 --> 1:04:00.791
and I'm trying to control it all.

1:04:00.875 --> 1:04:02.625
-He's not Oji.
-I'm just trying to--

1:04:03.583 --> 1:04:05.458
-What?
-Gonker is not Oji.

1:04:07.166 --> 1:04:09.500
I know that.
This has nothing to do with Oji.

1:04:09.583 --> 1:04:11.791
You have to stop
putting pressure on yourself.

1:04:15.041 --> 1:04:15.875
It's…

1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:20.125
It's just that
it's happening all over again.

1:04:22.916 --> 1:04:26.833
I promised myself that I would never care
about another dog again,

1:04:26.916 --> 1:04:28.250
and then here I am.

1:04:30.041 --> 1:04:31.833
Heartbroken again.

1:04:32.416 --> 1:04:33.541
Look, look, look, I…

1:04:34.625 --> 1:04:36.875
I promise you it won't happen again.

1:04:38.833 --> 1:04:40.250
We're gonna find this dog.

1:04:40.333 --> 1:04:42.541
-You keep saying that.
-I know.

1:04:43.666 --> 1:04:44.750
Because I believe it.

1:05:04.208 --> 1:05:06.625
<i>Hey, it's Fielding.</i>
<i>Sorry I missed your call. Leave a message.</i>

1:05:06.708 --> 1:05:10.000
Look, I am officially beyond worried
to extremely concerned.

1:05:10.083 --> 1:05:12.250
You were supposed to be here
40 minutes ago.

1:05:12.750 --> 1:05:14.750
I'm gonna go
to some of the other trailheads.

1:05:14.833 --> 1:05:17.416
If you end up here,
stay put because I'll be back.

1:05:19.333 --> 1:05:22.416
-<i>Why wouldn't he be answering?</i>
-Reception's spotty on the trail.

1:05:22.500 --> 1:05:24.500
He could have a dead battery or--

1:05:24.583 --> 1:05:25.500
Or what?

1:05:26.250 --> 1:05:29.833
<i>The kid is skin and bones.</i>
<i>He hasn't eaten. He's not sleeping.</i>

1:05:29.916 --> 1:05:32.083
It's dark. He's tired.
I hope he didn't hurt himself.

1:05:32.166 --> 1:05:35.416
I've been up and down this trail.
He's over two hours late.

1:05:35.500 --> 1:05:38.916
-You should have called me sooner!
-Well, I didn't wanna worry you.

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.791
Oh, yeah? How's that working out for ya?

1:05:40.875 --> 1:05:44.291
<i>We've already lost a dog</i>
<i>in these damn woods. And now our son too?</i>

1:05:45.208 --> 1:05:46.041
Hang on.

1:05:46.791 --> 1:05:48.250
I found him! I'll call you back.

1:05:59.916 --> 1:06:00.791
Fielding.

1:06:01.541 --> 1:06:02.791
Where were you?

1:06:02.875 --> 1:06:04.375
I was looking for my dog.

1:06:06.166 --> 1:06:07.000
Come on.

1:06:11.416 --> 1:06:14.291
-Watch the heel.
-I got you. Ready?

1:06:15.333 --> 1:06:16.541
Oh, look at this.

1:06:18.583 --> 1:06:20.583
Okay. Well,

1:06:21.458 --> 1:06:23.208
twenty-four miles in 12 hours

1:06:24.583 --> 1:06:26.916
on unpaved roads, uphill, downhill.

1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:30.750
-You're pushing yourself to the brink.
-I had to cover more ground.

1:06:32.208 --> 1:06:33.333
Gonker needs me.

1:06:38.166 --> 1:06:40.041
Remember the other day you were asking me

1:06:40.125 --> 1:06:42.416
if I was proud
of how you were living your life?

1:06:42.500 --> 1:06:43.750
Your clothes, your choices?

1:06:43.833 --> 1:06:45.500
-Hey, Dad--
-You didn't let me answer.

1:06:45.583 --> 1:06:48.958
-We're cool. We don't have to do all that.
-Hey, hey, hey! Hey, no.

1:06:49.916 --> 1:06:52.291
Will you listen for a minute, okay?
Please.

1:06:52.875 --> 1:06:54.708
I can't take pride in your clothes.

1:06:55.708 --> 1:06:58.375
Okay? I can't take pride
in living in a cabin

1:06:58.458 --> 1:07:01.333
or any of those kind of things
because they're just that, they're things.

1:07:01.416 --> 1:07:03.333
That's not what fathers take pride in.

1:07:05.916 --> 1:07:07.458
I take pride in your character.

1:07:08.625 --> 1:07:12.416
The character that embraces
being kind to everyone.

1:07:14.541 --> 1:07:15.375
It's fun.

1:07:16.708 --> 1:07:17.583
It's funny.

1:07:19.458 --> 1:07:20.375
Loving.

1:07:20.458 --> 1:07:24.333
The kind of character that rescues a puppy
from a shelter and gives it a home.

1:07:24.416 --> 1:07:28.791
The kind of character
that would walk all night on bloody feet

1:07:28.875 --> 1:07:31.041
before it would give up
on someone it loves.

1:07:32.458 --> 1:07:33.291
So,

1:07:34.875 --> 1:07:38.875
you're asking me if I'm proud of you.
I have always been proud of you.

1:07:42.541 --> 1:07:44.041
I wouldn't know how not to be.

1:07:52.833 --> 1:07:53.958
I love you, Dad.

1:07:56.708 --> 1:07:57.833
I love you too.

1:08:08.291 --> 1:08:10.458
Twenty-four miles? That's insane.

1:08:10.541 --> 1:08:14.791
That's what I told him.
But he's not listening. He's dedicated.

1:08:15.750 --> 1:08:16.666
<i>And you?</i>

1:08:16.750 --> 1:08:18.458
Fielding's my compass now.

1:08:19.458 --> 1:08:20.875
<i>Wherever he says we go,</i>

1:08:21.708 --> 1:08:22.625
we go.

1:08:22.708 --> 1:08:24.666
Be safe. I love you.

1:08:24.750 --> 1:08:25.583
<i>Love you.</i>

1:08:35.333 --> 1:08:36.666
<i>Almost out of kibble.</i>

1:08:36.750 --> 1:08:39.458
We'll pick some up at town.
It's starting to get dark.

1:08:40.041 --> 1:08:43.125
What if he comes back to the trail
at night and we're not here to find him?

1:08:43.208 --> 1:08:45.458
The experts were telling your mom
if he's anywhere nearby,

1:08:45.541 --> 1:08:47.000
he's gonna pick up your scent.

1:08:47.083 --> 1:08:49.666
I just…
I don't think we've been anywhere nearby.

1:08:50.916 --> 1:08:53.375
-Don't give up hope.
-It's getting hard not to.

1:08:55.416 --> 1:08:56.500
Gonker!

1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:57.875
Hello?

1:09:00.208 --> 1:09:02.125
Who's looking for Gonker?

1:09:02.208 --> 1:09:03.208
I am!

1:09:04.708 --> 1:09:05.541
Fielding?

1:09:06.500 --> 1:09:07.916
-Nate?
-Hey, man!

1:09:08.500 --> 1:09:10.541
Ow! Oh, God. Ow.

1:09:11.458 --> 1:09:12.291
Ow.

1:09:13.875 --> 1:09:17.291
What are you doing off the trail, man?
You could get lost, you could get killed.

1:09:17.375 --> 1:09:20.833
I know! I almost did right there.
Listen. Wasn't my intention.

1:09:20.916 --> 1:09:24.125
I'm not real good
at following all these markers.

1:09:24.208 --> 1:09:29.291
They should make real signs, you know?
Something that says, "Trail that way."

1:09:29.375 --> 1:09:31.083
Dude, what are you doing out here?

1:09:31.166 --> 1:09:32.125
Looking for our dog.

1:09:32.208 --> 1:09:36.125
You said that you guys started north.
I started south, worked my way up.

1:09:36.208 --> 1:09:38.291
Got my walking stick
on account of all the walking.

1:09:38.375 --> 1:09:40.583
Got some donuts
'cause I thought Gonk might smell them.

1:09:40.666 --> 1:09:42.291
Interesting thing about donuts.

1:09:42.375 --> 1:09:44.041
You know who else loves donuts?

1:09:44.125 --> 1:09:47.000
Every freaking bird
in the state of Virginia,

1:09:47.083 --> 1:09:51.041
because I have been mauled
and pecked at and attacked, and it's--

1:09:51.125 --> 1:09:53.125
No, I mean, what are you doing out here?

1:09:56.500 --> 1:09:57.666
This is my fault.

1:10:00.458 --> 1:10:04.083
I'm the one who pointed out
the fox to Gonker, so this is my fault.

1:10:06.750 --> 1:10:09.583
I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to.
You know that I loved him.

1:10:09.666 --> 1:10:11.666
-I know that you loved him, and we just--
-Nate.

1:10:12.583 --> 1:10:13.625
I never once,

1:10:14.625 --> 1:10:16.666
for a second, ever thought to blame you.

1:10:19.416 --> 1:10:20.375
Like, ever.

1:10:22.791 --> 1:10:25.083
Wish I would have known that,

1:10:26.041 --> 1:10:28.708
because these crows
have been kicking my ass.

1:10:28.791 --> 1:10:31.208
All right. I got an idea.

1:10:32.583 --> 1:10:34.083
-Where's he going?
-Dude, I don't know.

1:10:34.166 --> 1:10:36.291
-God, it's so good to see you.
-Don't touch me, man.

1:10:36.375 --> 1:10:37.333
I know you love me.

1:10:37.416 --> 1:10:39.750
Oh, my God. Mmm. Mmm.

1:10:43.625 --> 1:10:44.458
Oh, my God.

1:10:46.916 --> 1:10:47.750
So good.

1:10:49.708 --> 1:10:51.458
Mmm! Oh, my God.

1:10:53.958 --> 1:10:56.333
Did they not feed you
at the psych department, Nate?

1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:01.125
It's more of a food for the soul
kind of group, you know?

1:11:01.208 --> 1:11:03.208
I'm thinking about selling out,
going to Wall Street.

1:11:03.291 --> 1:11:07.208
Wow! Yeah? What about
becoming a "philosophical artist"?

1:11:07.708 --> 1:11:09.000
"I love capitalism."

1:11:09.083 --> 1:11:10.833
"It rewards me for being brave,

1:11:10.916 --> 1:11:14.583
and it awards me for being innovative
and thinking outside the box."

1:11:14.666 --> 1:11:17.291
Henry Rollins.
And he was a philosophical artist.

1:11:17.375 --> 1:11:19.708
Maybe I'll become
an organic farmer or something.

1:11:19.791 --> 1:11:22.583
-I don't know. Weighing both options.
-You're strange, Nate.

1:11:23.541 --> 1:11:26.125
And I love it.
All right, I'm gonna go hit the head.

1:11:28.458 --> 1:11:31.083
Papa seems like
he's in a fine mood tonight.

1:11:31.166 --> 1:11:33.458
How you guys getting along,
all this time together?

1:11:34.416 --> 1:11:35.250
Um…

1:11:35.875 --> 1:11:39.666
Good. Really good.
Yeah, I think we found our rhythm.

1:11:40.333 --> 1:11:42.000
-Can I clear these?
-Yes, thank you.

1:11:42.083 --> 1:11:43.541
-Uh, yeah, thank you.

1:11:43.625 --> 1:11:45.625
-You didn't go near your burger.
-I know.

1:11:47.375 --> 1:11:48.500
Thank you.

1:11:49.083 --> 1:11:50.416
What's up with that?

1:11:51.083 --> 1:11:53.041
Just don't bring that up
in front of my dad.

1:11:53.125 --> 1:11:53.958
Okay.

1:11:54.041 --> 1:11:56.583
It's just my stomach's been upset.

1:11:56.666 --> 1:11:59.041
It was messed up last semester of school.

1:11:59.708 --> 1:12:02.416
Fields, you gotta get that checked.
It could be who knows what?

1:12:02.500 --> 1:12:05.916
-Another beer?
-None for me, thank you. I am driving.

1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:07.791
I'll have another water
when you get a chance.

1:12:07.875 --> 1:12:11.833
Um, also if there's any way you could hang
this up by the door, maybe on that board.

1:12:11.916 --> 1:12:13.875
Otherwise, I totally understand.
It's fine.

1:12:13.958 --> 1:12:15.000
Your dog's lost?

1:12:15.708 --> 1:12:17.958
Oh, my goodness! He's so cute!

1:12:18.958 --> 1:12:21.541
-No worries. I'll do it myself.
-Thank you. Really.

1:12:21.625 --> 1:12:23.625
"Nothing for me. I'm driving."

1:12:28.583 --> 1:12:30.541
I'm sorry, is this high school?

1:12:30.625 --> 1:12:31.541
Just ignore it.

1:12:36.958 --> 1:12:40.166
You spoiled college guys go on the trail.

1:12:40.250 --> 1:12:44.458
You don't know what the hell you're doing.
That's why you lost your stupid dog.

1:12:44.541 --> 1:12:47.375
Hey, I've had a hell of a week and a half.

1:12:47.458 --> 1:12:48.291
Uh…

1:12:48.375 --> 1:12:52.041
-So if you two idiots could shut up?
-Don't…

1:12:52.125 --> 1:12:53.083
Okay.

1:12:53.166 --> 1:12:54.458
Oh, my God.

1:12:54.541 --> 1:12:56.666
-You got something to say?
-Mmm-mmm.

1:12:58.625 --> 1:12:59.791
Say it to my face.

1:12:59.875 --> 1:13:03.583
Oh, no, I already had to hear you.
Now you want me to look at you too?

1:13:03.666 --> 1:13:05.250
Oh, my God! Shut up!

1:13:06.208 --> 1:13:07.625
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:13:07.708 --> 1:13:10.041
I wasn't aware there was dancing
at this establishment.

1:13:10.125 --> 1:13:12.208
-Doesn't concern you, Pops.
-Ha!

1:13:12.291 --> 1:13:14.708
Yeah, well, that's where you're wrong.
See, this is my son.

1:13:14.791 --> 1:13:16.291
-Dad.
-And that is his friend.

1:13:16.375 --> 1:13:19.291
So it is my biological edict
to protect 'em.

1:13:19.375 --> 1:13:21.125
What do you think
you're gonna do about it?

1:13:23.125 --> 1:13:24.583
Well, that's a fair question.

1:13:25.833 --> 1:13:27.750
You see, I think for a living.

1:13:27.833 --> 1:13:30.458
Anywhere there's a problem
around the world,

1:13:30.541 --> 1:13:31.916
I look at the facts on the ground,

1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.125
and then I make
what's called a "predictive assumption."

1:13:34.708 --> 1:13:37.041
And here's my assessment
of the facts right now.

1:13:37.625 --> 1:13:39.250
That you've had a couple drinks,

1:13:39.791 --> 1:13:41.250
you're looking to have a fight.

1:13:41.333 --> 1:13:44.833
These two are not. So now you're thinking
maybe you'll take a run at me.

1:13:44.916 --> 1:13:46.708
-100%.
-Yeah, well.

1:13:47.541 --> 1:13:48.791
Here's what's gonna happen.

1:13:49.375 --> 1:13:50.750
I'm gonna take my thumb

1:13:52.208 --> 1:13:55.708
and jam it so far into your eye socket
it could pop it out like a cork.

1:13:57.083 --> 1:14:00.083
So now it's your turn to think,
is it worth the risk?

1:14:00.875 --> 1:14:04.083
Because if it's not,
then you better back off.

1:14:10.875 --> 1:14:12.250
Y'all ain't worth the hassle.

1:14:29.958 --> 1:14:32.416
The cheeseburger was fantastic.

1:14:38.791 --> 1:14:40.833
He's Dwayne Johnson in Dockers.

1:14:43.541 --> 1:14:45.000
<i>They found him!</i>

1:14:45.083 --> 1:14:47.583
<i>A yellow lab mix</i>
<i>was brought into a shelter really weak.</i>

1:14:47.666 --> 1:14:50.500
<i>Blood tests show he has Addison's disease.</i>

1:15:10.125 --> 1:15:11.458
All right, here we go!

1:15:15.291 --> 1:15:16.416
You okay?

1:15:16.500 --> 1:15:17.375
Yeah.

1:15:18.541 --> 1:15:19.666
Just wanna get my dog.

1:15:20.625 --> 1:15:23.000
We will have him soon enough.

1:15:26.666 --> 1:15:29.166
We had heard about Gonker on the news.

1:15:29.250 --> 1:15:33.500
And when the vet said he had Addison's,
oh, we were so excited to call you guys.

1:15:33.583 --> 1:15:34.416
Here.

1:15:45.666 --> 1:15:46.500
It's not him.

1:15:48.583 --> 1:15:52.541
I don't… I don't understand.
It looks just like the dog on the flyer.

1:15:53.125 --> 1:15:56.750
He's a little smaller and has reddish fur.

1:15:59.875 --> 1:16:01.500
Thank you. Thank you.

1:16:19.791 --> 1:16:20.625
Oh, Fielding.

1:17:05.791 --> 1:17:07.291
I'm so sorry, Gonker.

1:17:44.750 --> 1:17:46.041
No. Oh, no.

1:17:53.791 --> 1:17:55.750
Dad, what are we doing?
We have to keep looking.

1:17:55.833 --> 1:17:56.958
Say hello to your mother.

1:17:57.041 --> 1:17:58.583
-You look terrible!
-We can't give up.

1:17:58.666 --> 1:17:59.875
He's gonna die out there.

1:17:59.958 --> 1:18:02.583
-Honey, odds are he's already gone.
-Don't say that.

1:18:02.666 --> 1:18:05.875
-I found your sandwich. You didn't eat it.
-I don't care about that.

1:18:05.958 --> 1:18:09.208
Fielding, we have had over
a hundred people trying to find Gonker,

1:18:09.291 --> 1:18:10.583
and he still hasn't turned up.

1:18:10.666 --> 1:18:13.125
You're not sleeping,
and you're not eating,

1:18:13.208 --> 1:18:15.416
and the stress is taking its toll on you.

1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:17.791
We need to keep looking.

1:18:18.291 --> 1:18:19.916
It's over, baby.

1:18:28.083 --> 1:18:29.791
He was the best friend I ever had.

1:18:29.875 --> 1:18:31.125
I know.

1:18:33.208 --> 1:18:35.125
I know exactly how you feel.

1:19:00.083 --> 1:19:01.583
-Hi.
-<i>Hey.</i>

1:19:01.666 --> 1:19:03.166
<i>Um, Mom and Dad filled me in.</i>

1:19:03.250 --> 1:19:04.250
How you holding up?

1:19:05.250 --> 1:19:06.208
<i>I'm not.</i>

1:19:06.708 --> 1:19:08.583
You did everything you could, Fields.

1:19:09.333 --> 1:19:11.458
<i>All I could</i>
<i>would mean I'm still out there.</i>

1:19:11.541 --> 1:19:12.583
You're sick.

1:19:12.666 --> 1:19:15.375
As hard as it may be,
you need to take a step back.

1:19:15.958 --> 1:19:17.625
Gonker didn't make me like this.

1:19:20.250 --> 1:19:22.250
I've been feeling sick
for a few months now.

1:19:23.458 --> 1:19:25.375
<i>Something's wrong, Peyton.</i>

1:19:26.291 --> 1:19:27.458
Every time I eat, it's

1:19:28.333 --> 1:19:29.708
excruciating pain.

1:19:31.375 --> 1:19:32.625
I'm coughing up blood.

1:19:33.333 --> 1:19:35.416
<i>Anything other than water makes me hurt.</i>

1:19:35.916 --> 1:19:38.500
<i>I thought it was just</i>
<i>an upset stomach at first, but</i>

1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:40.750
<i>a few weeks ago, it got really bad.</i>

1:19:42.125 --> 1:19:42.958
Peyton,

1:19:44.125 --> 1:19:45.375
I feel like I'm dying.

1:19:45.875 --> 1:19:47.416
Why didn't you tell anyone?

1:19:47.500 --> 1:19:49.083
'Cause I had to keep looking.

1:19:49.166 --> 1:19:50.916
Okay, no, listen to me.

1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:54.750
Either you go down that hallway and tell
Mom and Dad what's going on or I will.

1:20:13.458 --> 1:20:15.541
Mom. Dad.

1:20:17.875 --> 1:20:19.750
There's something I need to tell you.

1:20:20.250 --> 1:20:22.583
-<i>It's the Marshalls.</i>
-Is everything okay?

1:20:22.666 --> 1:20:24.875
-The machine will get it.
-<i>This is Matt Kessler.</i>

1:20:24.958 --> 1:20:30.083
<i>I'm pretty sure your dog's here</i>
<i>at the Evergreen Lodge in Nellysford.</i>

1:20:31.416 --> 1:20:33.500
-Hi, this is Ginny Marshall.
<i>Hi, Miss Marshall.</i>

1:20:33.583 --> 1:20:38.041
Yeah, we've got a dog that's been eating
out of our garbage for the past day or so,

1:20:38.125 --> 1:20:42.333
and we haven't been able
to coax him inside to check out his tags.

1:20:42.416 --> 1:20:45.791
<i>He's pretty skittish. But he looks</i>
<i>just like the dog in the flyer.</i>

1:20:45.875 --> 1:20:48.791
Do you happen to have a video of the dog?

1:20:48.875 --> 1:20:52.791
I just ask because several people
have said that they've seen Gonker

1:20:52.875 --> 1:20:54.083
and they've been mistaken.

1:20:54.166 --> 1:20:56.791
I tried to record him
doing his little tricks--

1:20:56.875 --> 1:20:59.125
Excuse me, what kind of tricks, exactly?

1:20:59.208 --> 1:21:00.541
<i>It was the darnedest thing.</i>

1:21:00.625 --> 1:21:02.333
He found a box of stale donuts,

1:21:02.416 --> 1:21:05.583
and the son of a gun was
flipping them up in the air with his nose.

1:21:30.958 --> 1:21:32.625
I don't know.

1:21:33.708 --> 1:21:36.458
You really think he could have
made it here in his condition?

1:21:37.333 --> 1:21:38.791
One hundred and eleven miles?

1:21:39.625 --> 1:21:41.000
Gonker isn't any dog.

1:21:41.541 --> 1:21:43.041
-John.
-Yes.

1:21:43.750 --> 1:21:45.125
-Fielding.
-Hi.

1:21:45.208 --> 1:21:47.250
-Thank you for calling.
-Yeah, thank you.

1:21:47.333 --> 1:21:49.458
Uh, so this is where you've seen him?

1:21:49.541 --> 1:21:51.666
Yeah, he eats right here at the dumpster.

1:21:51.750 --> 1:21:55.500
Usually hangs around that tree line,
comes out whenever food is thrown away.

1:22:02.625 --> 1:22:03.666
Gonker!

1:22:07.250 --> 1:22:08.625
Gonker!

1:22:13.916 --> 1:22:15.458
Gonker!

1:22:18.333 --> 1:22:20.166
When was the last time you saw him?

1:22:20.666 --> 1:22:23.166
Three hours ago.
I called you right after.

1:22:24.083 --> 1:22:26.666
He got spooked 'cause the dumpster lid
came down with a crash

1:22:26.750 --> 1:22:28.125
and he tore into the woods.

1:22:29.041 --> 1:22:30.875
Hope that didn't chase him off for good.

1:22:35.250 --> 1:22:36.541
Gonker!

1:22:45.208 --> 1:22:47.166
If he was here, he would've heard me.

1:22:49.208 --> 1:22:50.666
We will find that dog.

1:22:51.791 --> 1:22:53.625
Why won't you stop saying that?

1:22:57.291 --> 1:22:59.083
Because I believe it.

1:23:13.458 --> 1:23:14.291
Gonker.

1:23:16.458 --> 1:23:17.291
Gonker!

1:24:20.833 --> 1:24:21.708
Madam,

1:24:22.375 --> 1:24:23.958
your dog has returned.

1:24:52.708 --> 1:24:53.791
Goodbye, Oji.

1:25:04.791 --> 1:25:06.250
Hello, Gonker!

1:25:08.666 --> 1:25:09.875
Hi.

1:25:21.541 --> 1:25:23.208
-Fielding!

1:25:31.458 --> 1:25:33.250
Erratic breathing, semi-thready pulse.

1:25:33.333 --> 1:25:37.708
-What are we dealing with? Heroin? Oxy?
-No, no drugs. He hasn't been eating.

1:25:37.791 --> 1:25:39.250
Okay, we got it from here.

1:25:39.333 --> 1:25:42.375
Hang a bag, normal saline.
Give me a full blood panel and stat EKG.

1:25:42.458 --> 1:25:43.791
You got it, doctor.

1:25:45.083 --> 1:25:47.416
It was one of the worst cases
I'd ever seen.

1:25:47.500 --> 1:25:50.416
We did have to remove
the bulk of his large intestine.

1:25:50.500 --> 1:25:51.958
You know, he could have died.

1:25:52.666 --> 1:25:54.208
-From ulcerative colitis?
-Yeah.

1:25:54.291 --> 1:25:56.583
Sure, if remained untreated long enough.

1:25:56.666 --> 1:25:58.375
But just so you know, he's okay.

1:26:00.291 --> 1:26:05.291
From what I saw in surgery,
he spent weeks in acute pain and distress.

1:26:05.375 --> 1:26:08.083
Any reason why he would have
waited so long to seek medical care?

1:26:08.166 --> 1:26:09.583
It's gonna sound crazy. He…

1:26:10.583 --> 1:26:12.541
His dog was lost.
He wanted to keep looking.

1:26:13.250 --> 1:26:14.583
Yeah, well.

1:26:17.750 --> 1:26:21.083
Hansel and Gretel on their birthday,
so I get it.

1:26:21.666 --> 1:26:23.708
-When can we see him?
-Give him a couple of hours.

1:26:23.791 --> 1:26:25.750
He and his dog are gonna have
many more birthdays.

1:26:26.500 --> 1:26:28.791
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1:26:29.791 --> 1:26:32.291
Hey, if Hansel and Gretel ever go missing,

1:26:32.916 --> 1:26:33.958
look us up.

1:26:34.041 --> 1:26:36.291
-Sounds good. Thank you.
-Thank you.

1:26:36.875 --> 1:26:38.083
Oh, my gosh!

1:26:40.666 --> 1:26:43.208
And here he is,
chewing on his favorite pillow.

1:26:43.291 --> 1:26:45.250
And then, look,
this is his favorite stick.

1:26:45.333 --> 1:26:47.000
Every single time, he gets that one.

1:26:47.083 --> 1:26:50.791
And the vet is shocked
at how strong he is.

1:26:50.875 --> 1:26:54.416
Except for a few sores on his paws,
he's gonna be fine.

1:26:59.291 --> 1:27:00.458
He looks sad.

1:27:00.541 --> 1:27:03.000
Because he's wondering
where his buddy went.

1:27:04.083 --> 1:27:06.750
Well, if it isn't
the Marshall family pet detectives.

1:27:06.833 --> 1:27:09.791
-Hi, doc.
-Hi. How are we doing today?

1:27:09.875 --> 1:27:10.958
Uh…

1:27:11.541 --> 1:27:12.625
I want to go home.

1:27:13.708 --> 1:27:15.541
Gonker looks miserable without me.

1:27:15.625 --> 1:27:18.416
Well, he's gonna continue missing you
if you don't get some rest.

1:27:18.500 --> 1:27:21.208
The nurse said
you've been tossing and turning all night.

1:27:21.708 --> 1:27:23.250
The body heals when it sleeps.

1:27:23.833 --> 1:27:26.625
Yeah, he doesn't sleep well
without his dog.

1:27:26.708 --> 1:27:28.083
Well, do the best you can.

1:27:28.583 --> 1:27:31.708
Your body needs it.
Like, really needs it. Okay?

1:27:31.791 --> 1:27:33.416
-Yeah, okay.
-Great.

1:27:40.958 --> 1:27:42.750
-You need to relax.

1:27:42.875 --> 1:27:44.958
Yuri was much better at this than you are.

1:27:45.041 --> 1:27:47.750
Stick your head inside the jacket.

1:27:48.500 --> 1:27:50.000
Inside the jacket.

1:27:51.458 --> 1:27:53.458
-We're gonna get in so much trouble.
-No, I know.

1:27:53.541 --> 1:27:54.833
Come on.

1:28:03.583 --> 1:28:05.958
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

1:28:07.166 --> 1:28:08.583
We brought you a sleep aid.

1:28:10.208 --> 1:28:11.208
Gonker?

1:28:17.625 --> 1:28:20.125
-Oh, my God.
-Good boy.

1:28:23.666 --> 1:28:26.625
-Hey! Hey, boy!

1:28:29.166 --> 1:28:30.333
Hey, buddy.

1:28:32.833 --> 1:28:33.666
Hi.

1:28:36.583 --> 1:28:38.750
You're so tired. Yeah.

1:28:39.375 --> 1:28:40.708
You wanna go to sleep?

1:28:46.416 --> 1:28:48.416
-Good boy.
