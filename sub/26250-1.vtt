02:18.277 --> 02:22.346
In the name of the Father and the
Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.

02:22.348 --> 02:26.150
And I heard a voice of heaven
saying, "Happy are the dead

02:26.152 --> 02:30.024
who die in union with the Lord,
from this time onward."

02:40.199 --> 02:43.934
"Yes," says the spirit,
"let them rest,

02:43.936 --> 02:48.140
for their labors,
the things they did,

02:48.142 --> 02:52.977
go right with them forever."

02:52.979 --> 02:57.184
In the name of the Father, the
Son, and the Holy Spirit, amen.

03:09.162 --> 03:10.330
Oh.

03:30.383 --> 03:33.086
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

03:59.145 --> 04:01.245
Oh, my God.

04:01.247 --> 04:03.113
Charlie.

04:03.115 --> 04:06.985
Oh, thanks
for coming, huh?

04:06.987 --> 04:08.486
- Thank you.
- Hi, John.

04:08.488 --> 04:12.423
I'm Mary,
Charlie's girlfriend.

04:12.425 --> 04:14.259
Good to meet you.

04:14.261 --> 04:17.161
I'm so sorry about
your wife Sandra.

04:17.164 --> 04:19.262
Charlie told me
so much about her

04:19.265 --> 04:22.100
and what a wonderful
woman she was.

04:22.101 --> 04:23.237
She was, yeah.

04:25.438 --> 04:27.105
Thank you.

04:27.107 --> 04:28.372
Is he gonna be OK?

04:28.374 --> 04:31.208
Yeah, but he's pretty
banged up, I gotta tell ya.

04:31.210 --> 04:34.211
The motorcycle accident
really did a number on him.

04:34.213 --> 04:37.148
But the good news is his
surgery is next week.

04:37.150 --> 04:39.484
What is most concerning
is his left leg.

04:39.486 --> 04:43.455
But I'm optimistic that if he
responds positively to surgery,

04:43.457 --> 04:45.493
he'll be able
to keep it.

04:47.361 --> 04:49.227
Stay strong, brother.

04:49.229 --> 04:51.332
You too, Charlie.
You too.

04:54.167 --> 04:55.469
I'll be seeing you soon.

04:57.169 --> 04:58.304
I promise.

05:36.309 --> 05:38.410
Drinks on me!

05:38.412 --> 05:40.412
That's it.

05:40.414 --> 05:42.413
- What?
- That's it.

05:42.415 --> 05:44.316
- What?
- No more, John.

05:44.318 --> 05:48.085
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, unh-unh.

05:48.087 --> 05:49.353
The bar is closed.

05:49.355 --> 05:51.388
No! I want one
for the road!

05:51.390 --> 05:53.525
- You're not driving home.
- You watch me.

05:53.527 --> 05:56.096
- Oh, yeah? Hah.
- Yeah!

05:57.530 --> 06:00.230
Thanks for calling me.

06:00.232 --> 06:02.100
Come on, what is this?

06:02.102 --> 06:03.468
You call my daughter,
Lucas?

06:03.470 --> 06:06.271
I have empathy for you
losing your wife,

06:06.273 --> 06:08.239
but don't be
a jackass.

06:08.241 --> 06:09.374
Come on, let's get you home.

06:09.376 --> 06:10.441
I don't wanna
go home.

06:10.443 --> 06:13.146
Dad, come on.

06:16.549 --> 06:19.384
Come on, Dad.
Richard's waiting for me.

06:19.386 --> 06:20.617
Let's go, we gotta go.

06:20.619 --> 06:22.420
Watch out.

06:22.422 --> 06:24.491
This way. Dad.

06:36.602 --> 06:40.237
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Where do you think you're going?

06:40.239 --> 06:42.674
- Out.
- I asked you where.

06:42.676 --> 06:44.576
And what time
you coming home?

06:44.578 --> 06:46.410
You fucking kidding me?

06:46.412 --> 06:48.345
I'm the parent,
not you.

06:48.347 --> 06:50.581
You think you're
acting like the parent?

06:50.583 --> 06:53.286
Maybe you should try
putting the bottle down.

06:56.489 --> 06:58.191
Deal with him, Kate.

07:02.496 --> 07:03.660
What?

08:26.746 --> 08:28.382
Huh.

09:21.835 --> 09:23.470
Oh.

09:26.773 --> 09:28.609
What's it say?

09:35.648 --> 09:37.316
Gimme that.

09:41.588 --> 09:43.490
Give me that!

09:46.493 --> 09:48.528
Any other secrets,
Dad?

09:49.628 --> 09:52.497
Let me explain.

09:52.499 --> 09:53.765
Haven't you done
enough?

09:53.767 --> 09:55.369
Please!

09:56.702 --> 09:58.636
I promise, I just
found out about this.

09:58.638 --> 10:00.804
I only read the letter
last night!

10:00.806 --> 10:02.774
How could you do that
to Mom?

10:02.776 --> 10:04.575
And us?

10:04.577 --> 10:08.481
It's your job to hold
this family together.

10:13.485 --> 10:14.687
I will.

10:17.456 --> 10:19.359
I will.

10:45.719 --> 10:47.618
Hey!

10:47.620 --> 10:49.753
Well, look at you
standing up,

10:49.755 --> 10:53.824
standing tall, standing
proud, Master Sergeant.

10:53.826 --> 10:57.728
You, uh... sober
enough to talk?

10:57.730 --> 10:59.930
Now, you've been here
two seconds

10:59.932 --> 11:01.899
and already you're
busting my balls.

11:01.901 --> 11:04.669
Come on!

11:04.671 --> 11:06.536
What's going on?

11:06.538 --> 11:07.939
I'm getting married.

11:07.941 --> 11:09.940
Huh?

11:11.777 --> 11:13.477
Wha... Wait.

11:13.479 --> 11:14.812
It couldn't be
to that Mary.

11:14.814 --> 11:16.814
She's way too smart
for that.

11:16.816 --> 11:19.751
I know it's crazy,
but...

11:19.753 --> 11:21.551
Me getting married.

11:21.553 --> 11:24.624
Even crazier, someone
wanting to marry me.

11:28.695 --> 11:30.627
I see you got
the bike out.

11:30.629 --> 11:33.598
Well, I thought she
needed some attention.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.933
I wanted to take a ride,
it's been way too long.

11:35.935 --> 11:37.635
Where are you headed?

11:37.637 --> 11:41.472
East toward Montauk,
or the North Shore?

11:41.474 --> 11:43.877
The great northwest,
Master Sergeant.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.681
I'll come with ya.

11:49.983 --> 11:51.848
I... um...

11:51.850 --> 11:54.852
I really think I need
to do this one alone.

11:54.854 --> 11:57.689
Yeah.

11:57.691 --> 11:59.790
Hey, you just got out of
the wheelchair, come on.

11:59.792 --> 12:01.425
No, you're right.

12:01.427 --> 12:04.828
I ain't thinkin' straight with
this medication they got me on.

12:04.830 --> 12:06.863
And I need a damn walking
stick to get around.

12:06.865 --> 12:08.732
Who needs that shit,
right?

12:08.734 --> 12:11.868
You pullin' that reverse
psychology on me?

12:13.706 --> 12:14.874
Hmm?

12:17.474 --> 12:17.875
It was worth a shot.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.514
When you heading out?

12:23.516 --> 12:25.619
I think next Friday.

12:28.955 --> 12:30.854
All right...

12:30.856 --> 12:32.491
Well...

12:42.634 --> 12:43.934
And, uh...

12:43.936 --> 12:46.904
keep the chrome up on
this rusty motherfucker.

12:46.906 --> 12:49.743
I promise.

13:17.970 --> 13:20.539
I hope this ride is
everything you want it to be.

13:23.008 --> 13:25.843
And if you see my father,

13:25.845 --> 13:28.882
tell him to come home
in one piece.

13:30.048 --> 13:31.681
We miss him.

13:31.683 --> 13:32.952
I know.

14:14.060 --> 14:15.729
I...

14:16.830 --> 14:20.097
I know you had
your reasons why

14:20.099 --> 14:23.603
you didn't want to
tell me about it.

14:48.795 --> 14:50.630
You gotta take me
with you.

14:52.731 --> 14:54.732
Now, how did you know
I was here?

14:54.734 --> 14:56.836
Where else were you gonna
start this journey from?

15:02.041 --> 15:05.645
I told you I wanted
to do this trip alone.

15:09.782 --> 15:11.280
The operation
didn't work.

15:11.282 --> 15:15.819
They're gonna amputate my
leg from the knee down.

15:15.821 --> 15:18.758
It's the last chance I have to
take the ride of a lifetime.

15:25.864 --> 15:27.667
Keep up.

15:39.811 --> 15:41.078
Son of a bitch.

16:34.867 --> 16:36.900
Why do I need
to know that?

16:36.902 --> 16:39.937
I don't know, why do you
think they do it?

16:39.939 --> 16:41.604
We need a room for a night.

16:41.606 --> 16:45.978
Be $89.45, and will you be leaving
a credit card for incidentals?

16:48.848 --> 16:51.147
You got half of this.

16:51.149 --> 16:52.817
I'm just tagging along.

16:52.819 --> 16:55.987
No, you're
a self-invited guest.

16:55.989 --> 16:58.923
How much would you pay
if I wasn't here?

16:58.925 --> 17:00.891
Quit being a piker
and put in some money.

17:00.893 --> 17:03.093
It's not like you got two
rooms, it's a single room.

17:03.095 --> 17:05.896
- With two beds.
- I certainly hope so.

17:05.897 --> 17:09.066
I have a phone to attend to, can
we get this show on the road?

17:10.203 --> 17:12.203
What if I get two rooms

17:12.204 --> 17:14.137
and you have to pay
for yours?

17:14.138 --> 17:15.876
What about that?

17:17.275 --> 17:18.974
Half it is.

17:21.848 --> 17:24.280
I cannot believe
I'm watching this shit.

17:24.281 --> 17:27.217
Next month,
we'll be married for 30 years.

17:27.219 --> 17:29.119
Thirty years?

17:29.121 --> 17:30.320
Yeah.

17:30.322 --> 17:32.889
Uh...
Are you sure?

17:32.891 --> 17:34.791
Oh, come on.

17:34.793 --> 17:37.028
So be honest,
you sick of me yet?

17:37.030 --> 17:38.029
Oh, no way, babe.

17:38.031 --> 17:40.931
Do I still look
good to you?

17:40.933 --> 17:43.233
Are you kidding? Look at you.
I mean, come on.

17:43.235 --> 17:45.836
That's a good answer.

17:45.838 --> 17:48.071
How long has it been since
we've been on a trip together?

17:48.073 --> 17:49.874
Just us, not kids.

17:49.876 --> 17:54.845
Uh, 12 years,
3 months, 2 weeks...

17:54.847 --> 17:55.945
OK, OK, OK.

17:55.947 --> 17:57.947
What time is it?
What do you got there?

17:57.949 --> 18:00.050
We need to do that.
What I was thinking

18:00.052 --> 18:02.185
is we get away for
a couple of weeks

18:02.187 --> 18:04.355
and we go
wherever you want.

18:04.357 --> 18:09.126
It could be Italy,
France, Mexico.

18:14.100 --> 18:17.068
- Yes.
- <i>You requested a 7 a.m. wakeup call.</i>

18:17.070 --> 18:18.838
Thank you, you little bastard.

19:20.132 --> 19:22.966
- Son of a bitch!
- What?

19:22.968 --> 19:26.136
Engine cut out on me,
I had to coast in.

19:26.138 --> 19:28.204
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

19:28.206 --> 19:31.110
We'll have to find some
local mechanic around here.

19:39.452 --> 19:42.353
You need a hand?

19:42.355 --> 19:44.221
No, thanks.

19:44.223 --> 19:46.190
You two heading west?

19:46.192 --> 19:49.260
- Why?
- Yeah, we are. You?

19:49.262 --> 19:53.329
Maybe. Wanna get
your bike running or what?

19:53.331 --> 19:55.200
You have a bike?

19:57.003 --> 19:58.303
You let strangers
touch your bike?

20:00.339 --> 20:02.173
Neither do I.

20:02.175 --> 20:04.074
Come on.

20:04.076 --> 20:05.412
Shit!

20:22.093 --> 20:24.029
Let me tell ya
what I'm gonna do.

20:28.434 --> 20:31.137
- Hold onto that for me.
- OK.

20:32.405 --> 20:36.106
- Hey!
- You got something you wanna fuckin' say?

20:36.108 --> 20:37.674
Yeah.

20:37.676 --> 20:42.146
When you make an ass of yourself,
you should apologize right away.

20:42.148 --> 20:44.080
Is that right,
shit on a stick?

20:44.082 --> 20:46.383
We got something around
here called redneck pride.

20:46.385 --> 20:50.119
You know, I've had about
enough of you, inbreed.

20:50.121 --> 20:53.357
Oh, yeah? You wanna fucking
get hurt real bad, don't ya?

20:53.359 --> 20:56.260
Everybody calm down.
We're from out of town

20:56.262 --> 20:59.062
and we don't want no trouble, OK?
What's your name?

20:59.064 --> 21:01.197
- Earl.
- Earl.

21:01.199 --> 21:03.233
My name is Earl.

21:03.235 --> 21:05.301
Earl. Great fuckin' name.

21:05.303 --> 21:07.471
Let me buy you guys
a round of beers, all right?

21:07.473 --> 21:10.540
Why don't you buy beers for
everybody in this fuckin' bar?

21:10.542 --> 21:12.443
You got it.

21:12.445 --> 21:15.212
Beers for everybody
in the bar!

21:19.284 --> 21:22.353
Bartender, a round of beers
for everyone in here, on me.

21:22.355 --> 21:24.454
- Everybody?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:24.456 --> 21:27.457
And if by chance you happen
to know of a local garage

21:27.459 --> 21:31.028
that maybe could take a look at my
motorcycle, that would be nice, too.

21:31.030 --> 21:33.062
I don't off-hand, but I'll
find someone that does.

21:33.064 --> 21:34.197
Great, thanks.

21:34.199 --> 21:35.598
What the fuck
are you doing?

21:35.600 --> 21:38.034
You're not gonna buy beer for
everybody in this place.

21:38.036 --> 21:40.169
I'm trying to defuse the
situation here, Charlie.

21:40.171 --> 21:44.040
- Really?
- I don't want anybody holding up my trip.

21:44.042 --> 21:47.211
Hey, this guy wants to buy
everybody whisky shots now.

21:47.213 --> 21:51.080
Whisky shots on top
of the beers for everybody,

21:51.082 --> 21:52.515
on him!

21:52.517 --> 21:54.385
No, I've ordered
a round of beers.

21:54.387 --> 21:55.853
I'm not buying
anything else.

21:55.855 --> 21:59.056
Listen, old man, before you
and your gimp get fucked up,

21:59.058 --> 22:00.523
I suggest you get the whisky!

22:00.525 --> 22:02.192
What did you say?

22:02.194 --> 22:03.527
I said buy
the fuckin' whisky.

22:03.529 --> 22:05.398
I got your shot
right here.

22:10.602 --> 22:13.505
Who the fuck is this guy?

22:36.094 --> 22:37.226
Come on, big guy.

22:37.228 --> 22:38.428
That's all you got?

22:40.232 --> 22:42.199
That's enough!

22:42.201 --> 22:45.135
Everybody get out
of my bar now!

22:48.440 --> 22:51.244
You move it, before I
shoot you in the good leg!

22:53.545 --> 22:55.180
Now!

22:57.616 --> 22:59.616
Ah, shit,
my bike's not running!

22:59.618 --> 23:02.589
It runs.
I'm not much of a listener.

23:32.484 --> 23:35.288
Now, we have to get
rid of this guy, right?

23:41.159 --> 23:42.294
Where are you going?

23:47.632 --> 23:49.532
We've never really met.

23:49.534 --> 23:52.537
My name's John.
That's Charlie inside.

23:55.307 --> 23:56.338
Willie.

23:56.340 --> 23:59.276
Willie. So, what you
doin', Willie?

23:59.278 --> 24:02.512
Thought maybe I'd tag along
for a couple of miles.

24:02.514 --> 24:04.615
A couple of miles?
Yeah, sure, why not?

24:04.617 --> 24:07.317
So, you got money
for a room?

24:07.319 --> 24:08.484
I have money.

24:08.486 --> 24:11.621
- 'Cause if you don't...
- I said I have money.

24:11.623 --> 24:16.326
I just choose to spend it
on living, not sleeping.

24:16.328 --> 24:18.628
Aww, come on, why don't
you just stay with us?

24:18.630 --> 24:22.232
We got plenty of room. I'll call
the front desk, get you a cot.

24:22.234 --> 24:25.601
Besides, we owe ya, for
helping us out in that bar

24:25.603 --> 24:27.372
and fixing my bike.

24:33.712 --> 24:36.349
You could save your money
for living.

24:49.462 --> 24:51.228
Make yourself at home...

24:51.230 --> 24:53.232
Willie.

25:03.375 --> 25:06.376
Uh, I better take this.

25:35.273 --> 25:38.610
You might find it pretty hard
to shift with a broken foot.

25:49.588 --> 25:51.521
Have you fellas
decided yet?

25:51.523 --> 25:55.424
Uh... I think, maybe...

25:57.396 --> 25:59.428
For God in heaven's sake,
will you make up your mind?

25:59.430 --> 26:04.434
OK, OK, the T-bone steak,
medium, with a baked potato!

26:04.436 --> 26:05.568
I'm not sure yet.

26:05.570 --> 26:08.571
What the...? Oh,
for crying out loud.

26:08.573 --> 26:12.445
Well, my name is Bev. Give me
a holler when you're ready.

26:21.320 --> 26:22.853
You know, I can't
remember the last time

26:22.855 --> 26:25.588
I rode so many miles
in one day.

26:25.590 --> 26:27.793
Not that I'm complaining.

26:39.804 --> 26:42.772
Why did you ask this
stranger to tag along with us?

26:42.774 --> 26:44.640
I'm not sure,
ask me tomorrow.

26:44.642 --> 26:45.908
This is not a joke.

26:45.910 --> 26:48.779
Look, I know his type.
He's like a stray dog.

26:48.781 --> 26:51.415
You keep feeding him
and he never leaves.

26:51.417 --> 26:53.617
Or worse, you stop feeding
him and he attacks you.

26:53.619 --> 26:56.552
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
maybe.

26:56.554 --> 26:59.489
- But there's one thing I am sure of.
- What's that?

26:59.491 --> 27:02.358
He sure quickly
made you forget

27:02.360 --> 27:05.430
that you hadn't ridden
your bike in a long time.

27:09.801 --> 27:12.636
We ain't waitin'
a second for this guy.

27:12.638 --> 27:14.905
He ain't around,
he gets left.

27:14.907 --> 27:18.407
Probably still got that
redhead still bent over.

27:18.409 --> 27:20.644
Unless her husband
came home and shot him.

27:28.520 --> 27:29.819
Shit!

27:29.821 --> 27:31.690
Come on!

28:07.959 --> 28:09.826
Give me a minute.

28:09.828 --> 28:11.830
Yeah.
Thanks for sharing.

28:13.765 --> 28:17.501
Ohio, the Buckeye State.
I haven't seen a buckeye yet.

28:17.503 --> 28:19.802

30:07.812 --> 30:09.948

30:13.685 --> 30:15.684
Don't worry about it,
he's fine.

30:15.686 --> 30:17.553
I got all my stuff
back there.

30:17.555 --> 30:19.856
You complain
all the time.

30:19.858 --> 30:21.791
Thanks for your support.

30:21.793 --> 30:23.894
Just concentrate
on the fishing.

30:23.896 --> 30:26.695
I can fish
with my eyes closed.

30:26.697 --> 30:27.696
It's what I do.

30:27.698 --> 30:29.899
It's not your eyes
I'm worried about.

30:29.901 --> 30:32.001
Goddamn it, I told you
I'd catch the dinner.

30:32.003 --> 30:34.604
You don't remember when
we rode out to Lake George

30:34.606 --> 30:36.705
back in '87 and I caught
that five-pound bass

30:36.707 --> 30:38.008
in the first five minutes
we was there?

30:38.010 --> 30:40.976
Five-pound bass,
my ass.

30:40.978 --> 30:42.244
The only thing
you caught

30:42.246 --> 30:44.880
was a five-pound buzz
after all those beers.

30:44.882 --> 30:47.986
Remember?

30:54.659 --> 30:55.927
So...

30:58.930 --> 31:00.830
you're going out
to Oregon

31:00.832 --> 31:03.002
because of a letter?

31:04.101 --> 31:05.935
How did you know
about it?

31:05.937 --> 31:09.004
I saw you reading it when
you thought I was sleeping.

31:09.006 --> 31:12.644
I figured that letter was
the reason for this trip.

31:19.851 --> 31:22.051
I just found out.

31:22.053 --> 31:24.820
Oh... Hey!
You son of a bitch!

31:24.822 --> 31:25.989
Bring him home,
Charlie.

31:25.991 --> 31:28.657
- Come on, you son of a...
- Get him, get him!

31:28.659 --> 31:30.092
What the fuck
you doing?

31:30.094 --> 31:31.863
- Get off!
- Get him!

31:39.871 --> 31:42.073
When did you start riding?

31:48.746 --> 31:51.716
My grandfather
loved motorcycles.

31:53.718 --> 31:57.186
He raised me
after my parents died.

31:57.188 --> 32:01.825
They were killed by a drunk
driver on New Year's Eve.

32:01.827 --> 32:05.694
Years later, he told me it was my
mother who was the drunk driver.

32:05.696 --> 32:08.130
She was an alcoholic
her whole life.

32:08.132 --> 32:10.802
She always said
she could control it.

32:14.106 --> 32:16.008
I guess not.

32:17.809 --> 32:19.943
He was the only family
I ever had.

32:19.945 --> 32:24.915
Right before he died,
he said to me...

32:24.917 --> 32:27.820
"Sonny boy...

32:29.955 --> 32:34.693
act like a man of thought
and think like a man of action."

32:39.231 --> 32:42.933
Knowing him, he probably read
that in a fortune cookie.

32:42.935 --> 32:46.970
My fortune cookie says, shut
the fuck up so I can get some sleep!

32:57.983 --> 33:00.750
Listen, uh....

33:00.752 --> 33:02.050
I was thinkin'...

33:02.052 --> 33:04.954
Mary's cousin doesn't
live too far from here.

33:04.956 --> 33:08.892
Thought maybe we could
stop by there real quick.

33:08.894 --> 33:10.863
What?

33:13.031 --> 33:16.199
I told you I wanted
to do this ride alone.

33:16.201 --> 33:19.069
Now you want me to go
to Mary's cousin?

33:19.071 --> 33:22.771
Look, her husband died six
months back from a heart attack.

33:22.773 --> 33:24.974
She's the only family
that Mary's got left.

33:24.976 --> 33:26.876
I mean, she's like
a sister to her.

33:26.878 --> 33:30.113
This better not be
some long detour.

33:30.115 --> 33:31.513
It's on the way!

33:31.515 --> 33:34.149
We're gonna go now and
we're not gonna stay long.

33:34.151 --> 33:36.919
Wake up Willie,
would ya?

33:36.921 --> 33:40.892
He's not going!
We don't know him!

34:04.116 --> 34:07.017
Hey, you be careful
what you do around her.

34:07.019 --> 34:10.085
So I can't smoke a joint
at the dinner table?

34:10.087 --> 34:12.121
What the fuck is
funny about that?

34:12.123 --> 34:14.056
I'll do my best.

34:14.058 --> 34:16.860
I think that's what
he's worried about.

34:21.333 --> 34:24.867
- Hey! There you are!
- Hey, how are you?

34:24.869 --> 34:27.170
It's been too long.

34:27.172 --> 34:29.905
- So good to see you.
- Oh, you, too.

34:29.907 --> 34:31.940
Vera, this is John.

34:31.942 --> 34:33.842
I've heard so much
about you, John.

34:33.844 --> 34:35.047
So good to finally
meet you.

34:37.281 --> 34:38.947
And who's this?

34:38.949 --> 34:40.116
This is Willie.

34:40.118 --> 34:42.117
Oh, hi, Willie.

34:42.119 --> 34:44.087
Oh, I wasn't
expecting three.

34:44.089 --> 34:46.221
But I cook
way too much food,

34:46.223 --> 34:48.224
so I hope you guys
are hungry.

34:48.226 --> 34:51.096
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, come on in.

34:56.067 --> 34:59.235
This is the best meal
I've had in a real long time.

34:59.237 --> 35:01.170
Everything absolutely delicious.

35:01.172 --> 35:02.971
Oh, thank you.

35:02.973 --> 35:05.977
Ah, I don't know...
I've had better.

35:07.112 --> 35:10.045
Oh! Thanks a lot, Charlie.

35:10.047 --> 35:11.614
Very funny.

35:11.616 --> 35:14.983
Mary called earlier, she wanted
to make sure you got in OK,

35:14.985 --> 35:16.985
so she wants you
to call her after dinner.

35:16.987 --> 35:20.090
I'm halfway around the country,
and she's hunting me down.

35:20.092 --> 35:22.257
Yeah, you know how they are.

35:25.096 --> 35:27.197
Well, I'm gonna clean up.

35:27.199 --> 35:29.398
Let me help you.
That's the least I can do.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.971
Oh, sure, thanks.

35:34.272 --> 35:36.005
You have everything?

35:36.007 --> 35:37.038
Yeah, I'm great,
thanks.

35:37.040 --> 35:39.275
OK, I'm gonna go
outside for a bit.

35:39.277 --> 35:41.344
The phone's right over there
on the coffee table.

35:41.346 --> 35:43.014
OK.

36:03.969 --> 36:05.300
I'm gonna take what's-his-face
out for a beer.

36:05.302 --> 36:07.337
Is that OK
with you?

36:07.339 --> 36:12.074
Sure, that's fine,
but do me a favor.

36:12.076 --> 36:15.011
Take my car,
it's safer at night.

36:15.013 --> 36:17.980
OK. Do you know
anyplace around here?

36:17.982 --> 36:19.215
Uh, yeah, the inn
right off the highway.

36:19.217 --> 36:21.317
You just make a right
out of the driveway.

36:21.319 --> 36:24.020
It's right on your left,
you can't miss it.

36:24.022 --> 36:25.224
Have fun.

36:34.965 --> 36:37.166
Um... Can I use
your bathroom?

36:37.168 --> 36:39.268
Yeah, of course. You
know where it is, right?

36:39.270 --> 36:41.172
- Down the hall?
- Mm-hmm.

36:44.074 --> 36:45.277
Hey, Mr. Cool.

36:47.946 --> 36:49.348
Let's go talk.

37:34.292 --> 37:36.391
Oh. There you are,
I thought you got lost.

37:36.393 --> 37:39.997
Oh, no, no, it's all good.

37:48.373 --> 37:50.109
I got it.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.215
What'll it be, boys?

37:59.217 --> 38:00.349
I'll have a beer.

38:00.351 --> 38:02.284
Me too.

38:02.286 --> 38:04.089
And a shot of whisky.

38:20.304 --> 38:22.306
Don't go too far with that.

38:32.350 --> 38:34.317
So...

38:34.319 --> 38:36.087
So?

38:39.324 --> 38:41.291
Well, this is
a great conversation.

38:41.293 --> 38:43.326
Let's get one goddamn
thing straight right now.

38:43.328 --> 38:46.431
John asked you along
on this trip, not me.

38:50.201 --> 38:52.201
Guess you think
I should thank you

38:52.203 --> 38:54.404
for taking care
of that redneck.

38:54.406 --> 38:55.971
I didn't need your
help, you hear me?

38:55.973 --> 39:00.442
- Mm-hmm.
- I've been taking care of myself my whole life.

39:00.444 --> 39:02.545
OK.

39:02.547 --> 39:05.280
You know
nothing about me.

39:05.282 --> 39:08.217
But I know
all about <i>you.</i>

39:08.219 --> 39:10.320
Your bullshit may
work on other people,

39:10.322 --> 39:12.257
but you're
transparent to me.

39:15.226 --> 39:18.226
I didn't care about
nobody but myself.

39:18.228 --> 39:19.330
Just like you.

39:20.632 --> 39:23.502
The women,
the drugs, the booze.

39:25.270 --> 39:27.239
And the running
from the law.

39:29.507 --> 39:32.141
People who have
a lot to hide

39:32.143 --> 39:34.478
realize the value of
keeping their mouth shut.

39:44.255 --> 39:48.157
So you're really riding all
the way to the West Coast and back?

39:48.159 --> 39:49.358
That's the plan.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.626
I always wanted to ride
on a motorcycle.

39:51.628 --> 39:54.364
I like the way they
look and everything.

39:54.366 --> 39:57.532
But... just never had
the chance to.

39:59.404 --> 40:02.237
Hey, my wife never
rode on it with me.

40:02.239 --> 40:03.572
- Really?
- No.

40:03.574 --> 40:05.407
Come to think of it,

40:05.409 --> 40:08.277
nobody's ever ridden
on the back of my bike.

40:08.279 --> 40:12.315
When you ride,
it's the open road out there,

40:12.317 --> 40:15.518
and everything just
washes over you, you know?

40:15.520 --> 40:17.552
- Wow.
- Like a wave of freedom.

40:17.554 --> 40:19.424
That's nice.

40:31.402 --> 40:33.205
My man.

41:23.455 --> 41:25.523
Oh, where did
you two go?

41:26.657 --> 41:28.424
He took me for coffee.

41:28.426 --> 41:30.462
Ohh!

41:34.364 --> 41:35.633
He's a good man.

41:37.502 --> 41:39.534
Thanks for having us.

41:39.536 --> 41:44.373
You know, you've always been
Mary's favorite cousin.

41:44.375 --> 41:45.675
I'm her only cousin,
jerk.

41:49.313 --> 41:50.545
You know you're
welcome anytime.

41:50.547 --> 41:52.514
Thanks.

41:52.516 --> 41:54.250
Treat Mary right.

41:54.252 --> 41:57.621
Oh...
You know I will.

42:02.659 --> 42:04.594
You're a great cook.

42:04.596 --> 42:07.299
Thank you.
It was my pleasure.

42:10.368 --> 42:12.534
Thank you, Vera.

42:12.536 --> 42:14.570
For dinner...

42:14.572 --> 42:17.340
for listening,
everything.

42:17.342 --> 42:20.775
Well, you weren't
kidding about riding.

42:20.777 --> 42:23.545
When the wind's blowing
in your face,

42:23.547 --> 42:25.313
you can't help but smile.

42:25.315 --> 42:26.616
It's very liberating.

42:26.618 --> 42:28.619
I wouldn't lie to ya.

42:29.721 --> 42:31.820
So, when, uh...

42:31.822 --> 42:35.525
I go visit Mary and Charlie,

42:35.527 --> 42:38.563
maybe we can go to dinner
and talk some more?

42:40.598 --> 42:41.730
That's a deal.

42:41.732 --> 42:43.567
No.

42:44.735 --> 42:46.670
That's a date.

42:48.540 --> 42:50.574
OK.

42:52.643 --> 42:53.779
Get a room.

42:56.447 --> 42:57.582
Ahh.

42:58.815 --> 43:00.451
Be safe.

43:16.567 --> 43:18.333
I got something
you guys may like.

43:18.335 --> 43:22.373
Find something that we all wanna hear,
none of that bubble gum bullshit.

43:27.377 --> 43:28.576
This may be broke.

43:28.578 --> 43:31.346
I thought you had
the Midas touch.

43:31.348 --> 43:33.516
I do.

43:33.518 --> 43:35.451
Oh, bullshit.

43:35.453 --> 43:37.619
I don't think
this thing works.

43:37.621 --> 43:40.355
That's 'cause
you're fuckin' it up.

43:40.357 --> 43:41.556
Midas touch.

43:49.467 --> 43:51.536
I'm walkin' here,
fuck face!

44:01.545 --> 44:02.811
Pie.

44:02.813 --> 44:04.813
Do you want
some pie?

44:04.815 --> 44:06.514
Little early for pie.

44:06.516 --> 44:08.683
Ah, never
too early for pie.

44:08.685 --> 44:13.389
It depends, madam, on what kind
of pie you're talking about.

44:14.692 --> 44:18.630
I'll have a coffee
and three sugars if I may.

44:23.534 --> 44:26.402
- What is that, 65?
- Close enough.

44:26.404 --> 44:30.739
You don't need the lint.
I'll keep the lint for later.

44:30.741 --> 44:33.442
There's an extra
nickel to grow on.

44:33.444 --> 44:36.614
Oh, thank you. Gotta start
building a kingdom somehow, right?

44:38.415 --> 44:40.549
Is this person gone?

44:40.551 --> 44:41.886
Yes. Yes, he is.

44:51.862 --> 44:53.663
You serve bacon?

44:53.665 --> 44:55.764
Yes, we do.

44:55.766 --> 44:57.699
Pigs cry.

44:57.701 --> 44:59.869
That's why they
put them in a blanket.

44:59.871 --> 45:02.737
Oh, an attempt
at wit.

45:02.739 --> 45:06.677
All the way out here,
I'll be goddamned.

45:08.746 --> 45:10.545
Can I get you boys
anything else?

45:10.547 --> 45:12.583
Just the check,
please.

45:15.585 --> 45:16.786
Does this thing work?

45:16.788 --> 45:18.621
When it wants to,

45:18.623 --> 45:20.592
just like everything else
around here.

45:51.922 --> 45:53.591
Need a hand?

45:54.891 --> 45:58.728
Oh, thank you for stopping.
I'm tired.

45:58.730 --> 46:01.831
A raccoon or some
goddamn possum

46:01.833 --> 46:04.699
ran right in front of me,
and when I cut my wheel

46:04.701 --> 46:07.936
to avoid crushing her head,
my tire blew.

46:07.938 --> 46:12.808
And then, like an asshole,
I tried to change it myself.

46:12.810 --> 46:15.710
That's a young man's game.

46:15.712 --> 46:18.581
Yeah, I agree.

46:18.583 --> 46:19.818
Oh, me too.

46:25.790 --> 46:28.556
You gonna take it on?
Be my guest.

46:29.592 --> 46:31.962
Come here,
I'll show ya something.

46:38.569 --> 46:41.672
Well, gents,
welcome to my home.

46:48.880 --> 46:51.880
Rode a Scout 101...

46:51.882 --> 46:54.551
And I rode
the Wall of Death.

46:55.953 --> 46:57.989
Ohh!

46:59.589 --> 47:01.690
What brought you
out here?

47:01.692 --> 47:04.793
Well, I fought in Korea,

47:04.795 --> 47:09.697
and after that, I felt
I needed a lot more space.

47:09.699 --> 47:12.101
So I got on my bike
and headed out west.

47:12.103 --> 47:13.536
Married?

47:13.538 --> 47:18.808
I was married to a girl who was
crazier than a shit-house rat.

47:18.810 --> 47:20.976
Even though she's not
with me anymore,

47:20.978 --> 47:24.581
I loved her every day
that we were together.

47:26.784 --> 47:29.020
So I hit the road and I've
been on it ever since.

47:33.657 --> 47:36.125
- You like that?
- Yeah, that's cool.

47:36.127 --> 47:38.092
A Native American
sold it to me.

47:38.094 --> 47:42.032
He told me it would
give me true inner peace.

47:43.801 --> 47:46.902
And you know, I thought
that was a line of shit,

47:46.904 --> 47:53.041
so, uh... but since I got it,
I do truly feel inner peace.

47:53.043 --> 47:55.777
Is that the bike
that's in the photo?

47:55.779 --> 48:00.849
Oh, yeah. I keep it back there
because I love the smell of it.

48:00.851 --> 48:04.987
And it's reminiscent
of things past.

48:04.989 --> 48:07.822
Motorcycles have come
a long, long way.

48:07.824 --> 48:10.058
But there's one thing
that never changes.

48:10.060 --> 48:11.960
What's that?

48:11.962 --> 48:16.098
Women love men on bikes.

48:22.839 --> 48:23.938
You're all good.

48:23.940 --> 48:27.011
- Drop it in.
- You got it.

48:32.183 --> 48:35.786
The Michelin Man works
for the King of the Road.

48:40.790 --> 48:43.058
Hey, Mr. King of the Road,

48:43.060 --> 48:46.061
I had way too much food,
and I figure

48:46.063 --> 48:48.797
I'd probably just throw it out
or throw it up,

48:48.799 --> 48:49.931
so... you want it?

48:49.933 --> 48:52.166
Well, I'll eat it.
Is that all right?

48:52.168 --> 48:54.936
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

48:54.938 --> 48:57.107
Oh, one other thing.

49:00.677 --> 49:02.813
I had an extra.

49:03.848 --> 49:04.983
Thank you.

50:20.156 --> 50:23.891
- You want some of this?
- Huh?

50:23.893 --> 50:27.029
Oh, I haven't smoked
that shit since Woodstock.

50:27.031 --> 50:29.801
You may be just
about ready then.

50:44.915 --> 50:47.315
Charlie can use
a hit of this.

50:47.317 --> 50:50.052
You may
have a point.

50:51.922 --> 50:54.155
He gets pretty cranky,
that one.

50:54.157 --> 50:57.058
- Sure does.
- He's calm now.

50:57.060 --> 51:00.029
But you should have seen
him in the Nam, boy.

51:00.031 --> 51:01.963
You guys were
in Vietnam?

51:01.965 --> 51:03.234
Yeah.

51:07.804 --> 51:08.973
You see any action?

51:15.045 --> 51:16.813
Yeah, enough.

51:25.056 --> 51:26.891
This one time...

51:28.259 --> 51:30.893
we went out on a...

51:30.895 --> 51:33.264
pre-dawn
search-and-destroy.

51:35.266 --> 51:37.065
And I remember
thinking...

51:37.067 --> 51:41.936
"Wow, what a wonderful
morning it is."

51:41.938 --> 51:44.174
And then
in one split second,

51:45.976 --> 51:47.976
our company
got ambushed.

51:47.978 --> 51:50.878
Weapons fired on top
of one another.

51:50.880 --> 51:52.917
When the smoke
cleared...

51:54.317 --> 51:56.853
it was just
me alone.

52:00.123 --> 52:03.092
That area looked
like hell on Earth.

52:03.094 --> 52:07.130
A few minutes later,
here comes Charlie...

52:08.998 --> 52:11.002
walking out of the
treeline with a prisoner.

52:12.902 --> 52:15.971
A young
NVA soldier.

52:15.973 --> 52:19.273
It was just us. All lines
of communication down.

52:19.275 --> 52:22.177
We know we got
to get out of there.

52:22.179 --> 52:25.980
So, Charlie ties up
the soldier,

52:25.982 --> 52:30.321
you know, so we can figure
out what we're gonna do.

52:32.022 --> 52:34.989
But then the damn
gook starts screaming.

52:34.991 --> 52:37.025
Only got two choices.

52:37.027 --> 52:41.262
We leave him tied up and
try to get out of there

52:41.264 --> 52:44.233
before all the zips
hear him screaming,

52:44.235 --> 52:48.906
or... we waste him.

52:51.241 --> 52:54.143
Now, we had had our share
of firefights before,

52:54.145 --> 52:56.147
but this one
was different.

52:58.148 --> 53:01.051
I didn't know if
I could cap him.

53:02.353 --> 53:03.985
And Charlie
sensed that...

53:03.987 --> 53:06.154
so he ordered me...

53:06.156 --> 53:09.190
start humping back and he'd
catch up with me later.

53:09.192 --> 53:14.262
I says, "No way, Master
Sergeant, no way!"

53:14.264 --> 53:16.998
So we start arguing
back and forth

53:17.000 --> 53:19.967
about me not wanting to
leave him there by himself.

53:19.969 --> 53:24.172
And meanwhile the gook has
managed to untie himself

53:24.174 --> 53:27.074
and he has this knife
he'd hidden on himself.

53:27.076 --> 53:29.177
He's about to stick it
in my back,

53:29.179 --> 53:31.212
and Charlie shoots him
in the head.

53:31.214 --> 53:36.386
We walk over to see this
lifeless body bleeding out...

53:38.087 --> 53:39.290
then we realized...

53:42.259 --> 53:44.295
it's a woman.

53:54.304 --> 53:56.505
And she was
pregnant.

53:56.507 --> 54:00.141
But in some
strange way...

54:00.143 --> 54:02.379
that bonded us
for life.

54:07.016 --> 54:10.087
He's my best friend.

54:48.491 --> 54:50.358
You see anything
out there?

54:50.360 --> 54:52.360
Just a couple of
jackalopes.

54:52.362 --> 54:54.362
What the hell is
a jackalope?

54:54.364 --> 54:58.266
Oh, you'll know when they sink
their big giant teeth into you.

54:58.268 --> 55:02.304
And you know what
they go for?

55:02.306 --> 55:04.038
Mangeradods.

55:06.409 --> 55:09.444
I'll see you
in the morning.

55:09.446 --> 55:11.112
Maybe.

57:07.431 --> 57:09.400
Gonna head
inside quick.

57:45.469 --> 57:47.438
Ooh, not what I expected.

58:10.694 --> 58:12.429
Like what you see?

58:24.674 --> 58:26.710
Can I get
some rolling papers?

58:29.513 --> 58:31.681
You roll
your own cigarettes?

58:32.683 --> 58:34.315
No, I don't.

58:34.317 --> 58:35.683
I had a feeling.

58:35.685 --> 58:37.687
Those your friends
out there?

58:41.257 --> 58:42.659
Something like that.

58:44.661 --> 58:46.527
What you doin' with them?

58:46.529 --> 58:48.395
Tagging along.

58:48.397 --> 58:49.563
What's your name?

58:49.565 --> 58:50.498
Summer.

58:50.500 --> 58:53.634
Hi, Summer.
I'm Willie.

58:53.636 --> 58:55.570
What brings you in
this part of town?

58:55.572 --> 58:58.706
My friends and I had a wedding
out in Vegas. Not mine.

58:58.708 --> 59:01.442
- Oh.
- One of my friends, and we're heading back.

59:01.444 --> 59:04.411
We're actually getting the house
ready for a party tonight.

59:04.413 --> 59:06.681
I'm not sure if you and
your friends have the time,

59:06.683 --> 59:09.384
but I'll give you the address
if you wanna come by.

59:09.386 --> 59:10.585
Yeah, sounds good.

59:10.587 --> 59:11.719
Done.

59:48.824 --> 59:53.460
So where we off to next?

59:53.462 --> 59:56.797
What do you say we knock off for the day,
Master Sergeant, we find someplace close by...

59:56.799 --> 01:00:00.335
No, no, we're not gonna
slow down because of me.

01:00:00.337 --> 01:00:01.536
We get up early
tomorrow morning.

01:00:01.538 --> 01:00:04.471
We're not gonna slow down
on my account.

01:00:04.473 --> 01:00:07.375
It's not that.
My back muscles are...

01:00:07.377 --> 01:00:09.411
Oh, come on, you know
that's bullshit!

01:00:09.413 --> 01:00:10.779
May I make
a suggestion?

01:00:32.502 --> 01:00:33.503
You know...

01:00:35.538 --> 01:00:37.438
I hate to give
the kid credit, but...

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.641
I know, I know,
who'd have thunk?

01:00:39.643 --> 01:00:41.809
- Hey, fellas.
- Hello, ladies.

01:00:41.811 --> 01:00:44.411
We're gonna borrow you
for a little while.

01:00:44.413 --> 01:00:45.614
Yeah, get him
outta here.

01:00:45.616 --> 01:00:47.549
L-Ladies, I'm OK,
really.

01:00:47.551 --> 01:00:49.386
We know you are.

01:01:08.739 --> 01:01:11.672
<i>♪ We keep on shakin' it,
shakin', yeah, yeah ♪</i>

01:01:11.674 --> 01:01:14.643
<i>♪ We got a lot to say ♪</i>

01:01:14.645 --> 01:01:15.880
<i>♪ We're gonna take it... ♪</i>

01:01:50.547 --> 01:01:52.579
So how'd you learn
to ride like that?

01:01:52.581 --> 01:01:54.983
My mom is a professor
at UCLA,

01:01:54.985 --> 01:01:57.751
and my dad took off
when I was like six,

01:01:57.753 --> 01:02:00.587
so I spent a lot
of time with my aunt,

01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:02.857
who was a stuntwoman
at Warner Bros. Studio.

01:02:02.859 --> 01:02:07.695
I would get to hang out with all
the actors every day on set.

01:02:07.697 --> 01:02:09.764
And before I knew it,
I was

01:02:09.766 --> 01:02:12.967
riding motorcycles
and working there myself.

01:02:12.969 --> 01:02:14.969
Wow.

01:02:14.971 --> 01:02:17.706
She taught me
everything that I know.

01:02:17.708 --> 01:02:21.545
She's 70 years old
and she's crazier than ever.

01:02:22.813 --> 01:02:24.712
So where is your
boyfriend tonight?

01:02:24.714 --> 01:02:26.950
He's downstairs.

01:02:28.485 --> 01:02:29.620
I'm just kidding.

01:02:31.788 --> 01:02:35.623
Guys are a little
taken back

01:02:35.625 --> 01:02:36.991
by the whole
stuntwoman thing.

01:02:36.993 --> 01:02:38.625
What about you?

01:02:38.627 --> 01:02:40.730
Girlfriend, girlfriends?

01:02:41.831 --> 01:02:42.967
Does it matter?

01:02:46.737 --> 01:02:50.605
No, I don't have a
girlfriend, girlfriends.

01:02:50.607 --> 01:02:53.911
Well, good, 'cause I don't
wanna have to kick you out.

01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:14.965
Oh, yeah.

01:03:37.686 --> 01:03:39.654
Oh, shit.

01:03:39.656 --> 01:03:41.021
Morning, Pinky Lee.

01:03:41.023 --> 01:03:43.056
Have you seen John?

01:03:43.058 --> 01:03:44.759
No.

01:03:44.761 --> 01:03:46.964
He's gotta be
around here somewhere.

01:03:48.732 --> 01:03:50.000
You spray in there?

01:03:53.069 --> 01:03:54.969
Enjoy the shower.

01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:02.913
I know where
I wanna go.

01:04:04.114 --> 01:04:05.715
Well?

01:04:06.917 --> 01:04:12.020
I would like to get
on the back of your bike

01:04:12.022 --> 01:04:14.958
and go all the way
to California.

01:04:17.627 --> 01:04:18.625
What, why that?

01:04:18.627 --> 01:04:20.929
Why? Because
it will be fun.

01:04:20.931 --> 01:04:23.864
And I want to swim in the
Pacific Ocean with you.

01:04:23.866 --> 01:04:25.866
Listen, we should
see America first

01:04:25.868 --> 01:04:28.071
before we go and see
the rest of the world.

01:04:29.806 --> 01:04:31.773
But you never wanted
to do that before.

01:04:31.775 --> 01:04:33.942
I was just worried in case
anything happened to us

01:04:33.944 --> 01:04:35.643
and the girls
were so little.

01:04:35.645 --> 01:04:37.645
I don't want you
to worry.

01:04:37.647 --> 01:04:41.049
You know, everything is
gonna be good for us.

01:04:41.051 --> 01:04:42.851
You'll see.

01:04:42.853 --> 01:04:44.751
I promise.

01:04:44.753 --> 01:04:46.020
And I love you.

01:04:46.022 --> 01:04:47.889
I love you.

01:04:51.027 --> 01:04:52.694
Sorry.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.032
Hello?

01:04:58.034 --> 01:05:00.101
Yes, this is she.

01:05:00.103 --> 01:05:02.039
Tomorrow morning?

01:05:04.741 --> 01:05:06.907
Yeah, sure.
Uh-huh, yeah.

01:05:06.909 --> 01:05:08.876
No problem.
Thank you.

01:05:08.878 --> 01:05:10.177
Who was that?

01:05:10.179 --> 01:05:12.713
Dr. Stillman's office.

01:05:12.715 --> 01:05:15.148
They're calling late.
Is everything OK?

01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:18.755
Yeah.
Everything is fine.

01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:24.893
Don't worry, you ain't
gettin' rid of me yet.

01:05:24.895 --> 01:05:27.929
I hope not.

01:05:27.931 --> 01:05:30.965
Are you ready to order? Would you
like to hear our specials, sir?

01:05:30.967 --> 01:05:33.101
Ah... yes.

01:05:33.103 --> 01:05:34.938
The specials.

01:05:46.081 --> 01:05:47.715
Johnny.

01:05:47.717 --> 01:05:50.117
Johnny!

01:05:50.119 --> 01:05:51.819
What?

01:05:51.821 --> 01:05:54.121
I lost my balance
and fell in the pool.

01:05:54.123 --> 01:05:55.956
Uh-huh.

01:05:55.958 --> 01:05:58.092
Uh...

01:05:58.094 --> 01:06:01.029
Get Willie and tell him
to meet us up front.

01:06:01.031 --> 01:06:02.195
All right.

01:06:02.197 --> 01:06:04.100
Hmm.

01:06:07.036 --> 01:06:08.938
Huh.

01:06:11.074 --> 01:06:12.806
Wh-where we
headed to next?

01:06:12.808 --> 01:06:14.909
Bend, Oregon.

01:06:14.911 --> 01:06:16.046
Cool.

01:07:08.797 --> 01:07:11.801
Just in case
you change your mind.

01:08:12.962 --> 01:08:14.128
I'll check us in.

01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:15.265
All right.

01:08:25.274 --> 01:08:27.942
Fuck! Hey, if you're not
gonna fuckin' help,

01:08:27.944 --> 01:08:29.844
get the fuck out
and get in the room.

01:08:29.845 --> 01:08:31.979
Get the fuck out of the
car, you bitch, let's go!

01:08:31.981 --> 01:08:33.948
Piece of shit.

01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:36.050
What the fuck are you
looking at, old man, huh?

01:08:36.051 --> 01:08:38.322
Why don't you mind
your own fuckin' business?

01:08:44.861 --> 01:08:48.095
Get in the fuckin' room!
Dumb fuck.

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:39.145
What?

01:09:39.148 --> 01:09:40.314
Oh, shit.

01:09:40.316 --> 01:09:42.049
Fuck you!

01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:44.417
Don't you touch me again, ever!

01:09:51.326 --> 01:09:53.359
Oh, shit.

01:09:53.362 --> 01:09:56.163
Whoa! No!
W-w-wait.

01:09:56.165 --> 01:09:57.965
You're gonna be
all right.

01:09:57.967 --> 01:10:00.234
Just calm down.
It's OK.

01:10:00.236 --> 01:10:02.936
Just put
the gun down. OK?

01:10:02.938 --> 01:10:05.172
Put the gun down, OK?

01:10:05.174 --> 01:10:07.043
Put the gun down!

01:10:11.114 --> 01:10:13.083
Oh, shit.

01:10:14.150 --> 01:10:15.285
Oh, shit.

01:10:27.362 --> 01:10:29.331
Shit.

01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:33.367
Drop that gun, mister.

01:10:33.369 --> 01:10:36.336
- Drop that gun now!
- Put the gun down now!

01:10:36.338 --> 01:10:38.439
- Wait a minute.
- I will shoot you!

01:10:38.441 --> 01:10:42.042
- You hear me, boy!?
- OK, here's the gun.

01:10:42.044 --> 01:10:43.978
- Check this out.
- I didn't do this.

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:46.213
Ask the girl
in the bathroom.

01:10:46.215 --> 01:10:47.515
- Check the bathroom.
- The girl knows.

01:10:47.517 --> 01:10:50.217
I came in
and found him like that.

01:10:50.219 --> 01:10:52.118
- Cuff him.
- Ask the girl.

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.188
She knows it wasn't me!
It wasn't me!

01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:57.324
Look, ask the girl!
Ask the girl!

01:10:57.326 --> 01:10:59.527
- Shut up.
- It wasn't me.

01:10:59.529 --> 01:11:01.431
- Let's go.
- It wasn't me!

01:11:03.333 --> 01:11:05.335
Take this piece of shit.

01:11:09.239 --> 01:11:11.271
Well,
what do we got here?

01:11:11.273 --> 01:11:13.274
A couple big-city bad asses,

01:11:13.276 --> 01:11:17.144
thought you'd roll into my town
and kick up some dust?

01:11:17.146 --> 01:11:21.448
You take some advice and roll
out of my town tonight.

01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:24.154
If they're still here
in ten minutes, lock 'em up.

01:11:36.298 --> 01:11:39.367
With everything
going on...

01:11:39.369 --> 01:11:44.171
I forgot that you had asked me
if you could tag along with us

01:11:44.173 --> 01:11:46.107
for a couple of miles.

01:11:46.109 --> 01:11:49.310
Well, we've traveled
a lot of miles

01:11:49.312 --> 01:11:53.049
and passed through a lot of
states, and you're still here.

01:11:59.489 --> 01:12:03.457
Don't bullshit me.
I'm not in the mood.

01:12:03.459 --> 01:12:06.226
What the hell's
the deal with you?

01:12:06.228 --> 01:12:07.461
Cops are looking
for me.

01:12:07.463 --> 01:12:09.363
What for?

01:12:09.365 --> 01:12:12.399
Let's just say, riding
with two older guys,

01:12:12.401 --> 01:12:15.368
be easier to blend in till
I get to the West Coast.

01:12:15.370 --> 01:12:17.473
Is Willie
your real name?

01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:22.243
No, you know what,
it doesn't matter.

01:12:22.245 --> 01:12:24.345
It just doesn't matter.
We all got our own problems.

01:12:24.347 --> 01:12:27.348
I just don't want your problems
becoming problems in my life.

01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:30.318
- What about you?
- What about me?

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:33.453
What about that fucking flask
you been hiding all the time?

01:12:33.455 --> 01:12:35.389
Before you start
judging me,

01:12:35.391 --> 01:12:36.560
take a look
in the mirror.

01:12:49.338 --> 01:12:51.238
I'm starting to get
the feeling

01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.407
that you think this is all
one big joke, mister.

01:12:53.409 --> 01:12:56.310
This game is very easy.

01:12:56.312 --> 01:13:00.180
I ask you a question and you
give me the right answer.

01:13:00.182 --> 01:13:03.451
But I'm growing real tired of
hearing all the wrong answers.

01:13:03.453 --> 01:13:05.519
So I'm gonna ask you
another question,

01:13:05.521 --> 01:13:08.189
but before you say anything,
I want you to remember

01:13:08.191 --> 01:13:10.157
two very important things:

01:13:10.159 --> 01:13:14.427
one, we don't really care much
whether you live or die.

01:13:14.429 --> 01:13:17.467
And two, I'd rather
see you dead.

01:13:19.134 --> 01:13:20.600
So I'm gonna ask you
one last time,

01:13:20.602 --> 01:13:22.536
why did you kill
that man?

01:13:22.538 --> 01:13:25.407
I already answered
your question.

01:13:27.377 --> 01:13:28.509
So fuck you!

01:13:56.638 --> 01:13:58.407
Take him.

01:15:28.731 --> 01:15:30.433
OK, where is he?

01:15:31.767 --> 01:15:35.505
Good news.
A woman confessed.

01:15:45.481 --> 01:15:46.680
So, where is he?

01:15:46.682 --> 01:15:49.382
He's in the back.

01:15:49.384 --> 01:15:52.288
You wait outside,
my boys'll fetch him.

01:16:34.429 --> 01:16:35.628
Let's go.

01:16:35.630 --> 01:16:37.467
Let's go.

01:17:12.368 --> 01:17:14.603
What is wrong
with you people?

01:17:16.571 --> 01:17:18.574
He's a Vietnam veteran.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.669
He had to be
hiding something.

01:17:49.638 --> 01:17:52.706
One of the better guys
we rode with, though.

01:17:52.708 --> 01:17:54.677
Would have been
a bitch in Nam.

01:18:01.651 --> 01:18:03.951
Sure you don't wanna get
checked out at a hospital?

01:18:03.953 --> 01:18:05.821
No, I'm OK.

01:18:08.557 --> 01:18:11.725
But I think...

01:18:11.727 --> 01:18:15.628
I think I'm gonna head back
before anything else bad happens.

01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:17.698
The hell you are.

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:20.768
You didn't ride all this
way to turn back now.

01:18:20.770 --> 01:18:22.739
And neither did I.

01:18:24.606 --> 01:18:26.875
I don't think you're
gonna make it, Charlie.

01:18:29.945 --> 01:18:31.778
I just...

01:18:31.780 --> 01:18:34.716
I just wanna finish
what I started.

01:19:18.828 --> 01:19:20.629
Hey.

01:19:23.732 --> 01:19:24.866
Can I help you?

01:19:32.941 --> 01:19:34.576
Charlie!

01:19:36.745 --> 01:19:38.746
- Hold on, Charlie!
- What's going on?

01:19:38.748 --> 01:19:41.782
My friend, he needs
to go to a hospital.

01:19:41.784 --> 01:19:43.716
I don't wanna lose
my friend.

01:19:43.718 --> 01:19:46.521
OK, let's get him
into my car.

01:19:47.923 --> 01:19:49.857
Come on, lift!

01:19:49.859 --> 01:19:51.992
<i>Michael Crawford, 340.</i>

01:19:51.994 --> 01:19:53.896
<i>Michael Crawford,
please call 340.</i>

01:19:58.968 --> 01:20:00.770
You need a new roof.

01:20:03.772 --> 01:20:05.939
Are you always
this cheerful?

01:20:05.941 --> 01:20:09.545
Thank you.
I'll look into it.

01:20:20.789 --> 01:20:22.691
She ever say
anything about me?

01:20:24.593 --> 01:20:25.895
Bare minimum.

01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:30.565
Why are you
here now?

01:20:33.002 --> 01:20:35.034
Well, uh...

01:20:35.036 --> 01:20:39.706
...my wife passed away
recently.

01:20:39.708 --> 01:20:42.609
Then, shortly
after that happened,

01:20:42.611 --> 01:20:44.077
I found a letter
from your ma

01:20:44.079 --> 01:20:46.883
that she sent me
25 years ago.

01:20:55.624 --> 01:20:57.991
Uh...

01:20:57.993 --> 01:20:59.696
...how did she die?

01:21:01.696 --> 01:21:03.766
Cancer. Her health
went quickly.

01:21:06.134 --> 01:21:11.003
You know, this is
the first time I've...

01:21:11.005 --> 01:21:13.843
been in a hospital
since she passed away.

01:21:17.847 --> 01:21:22.949
Mr. Moore, Charlie developed
something called DVT.

01:21:22.951 --> 01:21:25.118
Deep vein thrombosis.

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:29.957
It's a blood clot that, if not
caught early, can be deadly.

01:21:29.959 --> 01:21:33.025
The clot settled
below his left knee.

01:21:33.027 --> 01:21:36.865
And unfortunately we were
not able to save the leg.

01:21:38.767 --> 01:21:42.903
He's in recovery right now
and he's resting comfortably.

01:21:44.106 --> 01:21:46.073
Can I see him?

01:21:46.075 --> 01:21:49.676
Tomorrow would be better.
He needs his rest right now.

01:21:49.678 --> 01:21:51.878
Thank you, Doc.

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:54.083
You're welcome.

01:22:07.195 --> 01:22:08.797
Hey, you want
a water?

01:22:11.799 --> 01:22:13.065
Or you want
something else instead?

01:22:13.067 --> 01:22:16.903
No, water's fine.
Thanks.

01:22:16.905 --> 01:22:18.039
Yeah.

01:22:21.043 --> 01:22:23.076
You know, I never
thought I'd meet you.

01:22:23.078 --> 01:22:24.711
After all this time,

01:22:24.713 --> 01:22:27.784
I thought it could be easier
to act like you never existed.

01:22:30.852 --> 01:22:31.987
Yeah, I...

01:22:33.821 --> 01:22:35.824
I understand.

01:22:40.129 --> 01:22:44.901
Son, do you think
we could start over?

01:22:48.169 --> 01:22:49.936
Yeah.

01:22:49.938 --> 01:22:51.874
Yeah, I think that
would be OK.

01:22:53.174 --> 01:22:55.042
Great.

01:22:55.044 --> 01:23:00.715
You know, got a couple
of sisters back east.

01:23:04.018 --> 01:23:06.153
Yesterday
I was an only child,

01:23:06.155 --> 01:23:09.058
and... today
I have sisters.

01:23:10.926 --> 01:23:12.061
Yep.

01:23:14.862 --> 01:23:16.865
And a father.

01:23:25.007 --> 01:23:27.975
James...

01:23:27.977 --> 01:23:29.111
I need a hug.

01:24:01.977 --> 01:24:03.112
Hey.

01:24:06.048 --> 01:24:07.180
How you feeling?

01:24:07.182 --> 01:24:08.985
OK.

01:24:11.053 --> 01:24:14.086
I knew this leg had to go
when we got back.

01:24:14.088 --> 01:24:17.123
It's definitely gonna take
some getting used to.

01:24:17.125 --> 01:24:19.227
Yeah.

01:24:20.995 --> 01:24:23.896
Well, good news is,

01:24:23.898 --> 01:24:27.067
you never were much
of a dancer anyway.

01:24:27.069 --> 01:24:29.202
Shit.

01:24:29.204 --> 01:24:31.907
You know I got moves.

01:24:34.942 --> 01:24:37.243
Finally got to see
the Pacific Ocean.

01:24:37.245 --> 01:24:38.980
You sure did.

01:24:42.884 --> 01:24:46.219
Hey, I'm gonna
be shipping

01:24:46.221 --> 01:24:48.954
your bike back
east tomorrow.

01:24:48.956 --> 01:24:50.957
Thanks.

01:24:50.959 --> 01:24:53.060
For always being there

01:24:53.062 --> 01:24:55.961
and dealing
with all my shit.

01:24:55.963 --> 01:24:59.166
No.
Thank you, Charlie.

01:24:59.168 --> 01:25:01.368
You're
a true brother.

01:25:01.370 --> 01:25:02.972
Well...

01:25:04.239 --> 01:25:07.239
Now you get to ride home
on the open road

01:25:07.241 --> 01:25:10.946
all by yourself,
just like you planned.

01:25:13.315 --> 01:25:16.349
And keep the chrome up on
that rusty motherfucker.

01:25:16.351 --> 01:25:18.254
OK.

01:25:44.879 --> 01:25:46.278
Hmm...

His leg
was amputated.

01:28:21.102 --> 01:28:23.103
But he's OK.
