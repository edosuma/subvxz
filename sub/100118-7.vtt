WEBVTT

00:02.654 --> 00:04.047
Previously onDynasty...Remembering anything at all

00:04.091 --> 00:05.440
is-is a really good sign.

00:05.483 --> 00:08.660
For you. Do you remember
that we were engaged?

00:08.704 --> 00:10.358
I mean, do you remember
that you loved me?

00:10.401 --> 00:12.838
The Atlantix's next opponent
just canceled their reservation.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.623
The Victor Diaz
story just came out,

00:14.666 --> 00:16.538
and now they don't
feel safe staying here.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.061
We'll get you on Monica's label

00:18.105 --> 00:20.063
and use Jeff's streaming service
to play your music.

00:20.107 --> 00:23.153
Soon everyone will
know who you are.

00:23.197 --> 00:26.200
I am here to introduce you
to Fallon Unlimited,

00:26.243 --> 00:27.331
our new

00:27.375 --> 00:28.898
namesake magazine.

00:28.941 --> 00:30.247
Dominique's your stepmom, right?

00:30.291 --> 00:31.770
You got to promise
not to tell Jeff and Monica.

00:31.814 --> 00:33.033
They will never
accept me.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.686
And Dominique will kill me.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.819
We've been discussing sending
you to a school that specializes

00:36.862 --> 00:38.168
in this kind
of thing.Who's "we"?

00:38.212 --> 00:39.039
You mean Cristal?

00:39.082 --> 00:40.170
Acting like an entitled brat

00:40.214 --> 00:41.302
will definitely help
Cristal

00:41.345 --> 00:42.999
make her case
for sending you away.

00:43.043 --> 00:43.869
You know what would be great?

00:43.913 --> 00:45.393
If my wife and my son

00:45.436 --> 00:48.178
could coexist peacefully
so I could focus on the trial.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.224
Now it's time
to put your memory to the test.

00:50.267 --> 00:51.790
Do you remember this?

01:00.930 --> 01:02.671
Pull.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.326
Great shot, boss.

01:05.369 --> 01:07.328
Not your boss yet, Darren.

01:07.371 --> 01:09.112
True.

01:09.156 --> 01:11.114
Uh, since tomorrow is

01:11.158 --> 01:12.681
the last day of my trial
period, I was wondering

01:12.724 --> 01:14.161
if you had any
feedback for me.

01:14.204 --> 01:17.120
I want to make this
Thanksgiving one to remember.

01:17.164 --> 01:18.643
Not as much as I do.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.123
Something goes south
with this trial,

01:20.167 --> 01:21.733
I don't think
Thanksgiving in prison's

01:21.777 --> 01:23.561
gonna be as festive.Agreed.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.041
And when I say
"one to remember,"

01:25.085 --> 01:27.696
I don't mean in a tornado
or hostage situation way.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.828
Get those tidbits
in Anders' binder?

01:29.872 --> 01:30.829
Yes.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.135
The binder's very thorough,

01:32.179 --> 01:33.702
though a little
outdated.

01:33.745 --> 01:35.269
I'm not so sure

01:35.312 --> 01:37.532
that your Blockbuster membership
number is still necessary.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.577
Don't change the binder.

01:41.188 --> 01:42.711
Pull!

01:42.754 --> 01:44.582
Whoa.

01:44.626 --> 01:47.324
Your dad's skeet shooting
is giving me PTSD,

01:47.368 --> 01:48.978
and I wasn't even
in the military.

01:49.021 --> 01:51.154
Well, not that I remember.

01:51.198 --> 01:52.503
No, you weren't.
The closest you've come

01:52.547 --> 01:54.244
was Miami last year,
when you and I

01:54.288 --> 01:56.116
ate a ton
of General Tso's chicken.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.204
Miami?

01:58.292 --> 01:59.945
Art Basel?

01:59.989 --> 02:01.121
Wait, do you remember that?

02:01.164 --> 02:04.602
Maybe. Wait, were we
naked at Art Basel?

02:04.646 --> 02:07.475
Yes! Yeah, we were
always naked.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.085
I mean, in the hotel,
not at Art Basel.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.652
Wow, what a breakthrough.

02:10.695 --> 02:13.045
I feel like James Garner
at the end of The Notebook.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.917
Just, you know,
with better hair.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.614
Maybe later we can reenact
the ice cream scene.

02:16.658 --> 02:18.225
Yeah, I've never seen it.

02:18.268 --> 02:19.922
Or maybe I have.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.012
Allison, what is it?

02:23.055 --> 02:25.014
I'm having a breakthrough here.

02:25.057 --> 02:26.755
What?

02:26.798 --> 02:29.105
W-Wait, wait, wait, you're sure
he's coming to Atlanta?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.455
You can hold
the attitude.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.631
Okay, just get me a room,
and I'll handle the rest.

02:33.675 --> 02:34.937
Yeah, goodbye.

02:34.980 --> 02:38.070
Wow. Landon III
is coming to Atlanta.

02:38.114 --> 02:39.985
Am I supposed to
know who that is?

02:40.029 --> 02:41.987
He's an eccentric
creative director from England

02:42.031 --> 02:44.468
who's helped launch some of
the most successful publications

02:44.512 --> 02:45.730
in the last five years.

02:45.774 --> 02:47.645
He's staying
at the Windview Lodge

02:47.689 --> 02:49.560
for Thanksgiving dinner
and a turkey hunt.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.780
Although...
probably not in that order.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.869
And you're meeting
with him at this lodge?Yeah, well, if,

02:53.912 --> 02:56.132
you know, by meeting him,
you mean ambushing

02:56.176 --> 02:58.047
and then forcing him to come
work for Fallon Unlimited,

02:58.090 --> 02:59.048
then yes.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.267
Hey,

03:00.310 --> 03:01.790
you should come with me.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.270
Thanksgiving plans?
You know we...

03:03.313 --> 03:05.185
talked about taking it slow.

03:06.664 --> 03:08.100
Uh,

03:08.144 --> 03:09.972
that's fine. I'll be back
by tomorrow night anyway.

03:10.015 --> 03:11.713
I thought you said your dad
was making a huge deal

03:11.756 --> 03:13.062
about Thanksgiving
dinner tomorrow

03:13.105 --> 03:14.106
and taking a family photo.

03:14.150 --> 03:15.847
What, you're just
gonna miss that?

03:15.891 --> 03:17.022
God, I hope so.

03:17.066 --> 03:18.589
BLAKE:
Well, I admit it's not ideal.

03:18.633 --> 03:21.113
I-I just think that governance
of the Carrington Foundation

03:21.157 --> 03:23.203
should stay in the
hands of a Carrington,

03:23.246 --> 03:25.117
not some so-called
nonprofit professional.

03:25.161 --> 03:26.162
And you would like that
to be you.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.294
I like helping people.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.904
That's why I became a doctor.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.384
And now that I know what it's
like to have a disadvantage

03:30.427 --> 03:31.776
in life, I
can't think

03:31.820 --> 03:33.300
of anything I'm better
suited for than to run it.

03:33.343 --> 03:34.649
That's funny,
because I can't think

03:34.692 --> 03:36.999
of anything
you're worse suited for.

03:37.042 --> 03:40.089
The Carrington Foundation
is an actual business,

03:40.132 --> 03:42.526
not something you just sign up
to be president of.

03:42.570 --> 03:43.875
I'm well aware of that.It requires

03:43.919 --> 03:46.095
an actual knowledge
of how things run,

03:46.138 --> 03:48.271
which is something
you've now proven you lack.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.620
Many times.Cristal,

03:49.664 --> 03:51.231
I'm actually talking
with my father.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.493
Maybe you should leave.

03:52.536 --> 03:53.798
If you want to help,
maybe you could volunteer

03:53.842 --> 03:56.105
at a local shelter.
For dogs, obviously.

03:56.148 --> 03:57.237
That's enough, you two.

03:58.716 --> 04:00.152
She started it.

04:00.196 --> 04:01.197
I'm ending it!

04:02.067 --> 04:03.678
This could be
my last Thanksgiving

04:03.721 --> 04:06.071
before I'm behind bars,
so I would appreciate

04:06.115 --> 04:07.464
if the two of you
would make peace.

04:09.118 --> 04:12.077
And remember, the photographer
will be here tomorrow at 4:00

04:12.121 --> 04:13.122
to take the family photo.

04:13.165 --> 04:14.863
So I expect you both to be here,

04:14.906 --> 04:15.864
ready to smile.

04:15.907 --> 04:19.476
And act happy, damn it.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.783
♪ Don't give up

04:21.826 --> 04:23.263
♪ Just don't give up.

04:25.221 --> 04:26.701
Girl, you can sing.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.268
Thank you.

04:28.311 --> 04:30.748
And thank you so much
for letting me reschedule this.

04:30.792 --> 04:34.926
I know you're busy.Well, Fallon told me
you had a killer voice.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.319
And I think she undersold.

04:36.363 --> 04:38.408
I would love to talk
to you more someday.

04:38.452 --> 04:39.888
You know,
get to know each other.

04:41.150 --> 04:43.631
I mean, because you're
such a strong woman

04:43.674 --> 04:45.154
running her own business.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.199
Well, thank you.So...

04:47.243 --> 04:48.549
what do you think?

04:50.507 --> 04:51.987
Which corner were you hiding in?

04:52.030 --> 04:54.598
I was in the back making sure
your acoustics are good.

04:54.642 --> 04:55.686
Which they are.

04:55.730 --> 04:58.080
Thanks.
That means so little to me.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.603
Okay, I think we should

04:59.647 --> 05:01.257
probably just leave now.Not yet.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.652
I need to know if Monica's
interested in working with you.

05:04.695 --> 05:07.176
There's a possibility.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.310
I'm just not sure I'm interested
in working with you.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.272
SAM:
You're missing Blake's last

05:16.316 --> 05:19.101
Thanksgiving dinner and family
photo for a turkey hunt?

05:19.144 --> 05:20.494
I'm not going on the
turkey hunt, okay.

05:20.537 --> 05:21.756
I'm just sitting down
with Landon

05:21.799 --> 05:24.062
before he goes back to England.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.934
Good. If you're not here,
he won't miss me.

05:25.977 --> 05:26.848
Why aren't you coming?

05:26.891 --> 05:28.284
Because it sounds boring.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.720
Plus, I have a lot

05:29.764 --> 05:32.114
to do at the hotel with
the whole Victor Diaz fiasco.

05:32.157 --> 05:33.245
Whoever thought
owning a hotel

05:33.289 --> 05:35.204
meant spending
the entire day ordering

05:35.247 --> 05:36.510
free room service was wrong.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.642
Well, you could always
have dinner with Liam.

05:38.686 --> 05:39.904
He will be home alone.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.384
Hmm?Are you leaving Liam alone

05:41.428 --> 05:43.125
for Thanksgiving?

05:43.168 --> 05:46.737
Of course you're there,
lurking like an AV kid at prom.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.914
Um, do you think that's
such a good idea,

05:49.958 --> 05:51.133
given his issues?

05:51.176 --> 05:53.178
Aren't you worried
about a backslide?

05:53.222 --> 05:55.093
What, like Liam getting
back together with Ashley?

05:55.137 --> 05:57.792
No, no. You don't go back
to eating ground beef

05:57.835 --> 05:59.750
after you've had filet mignon.

05:59.794 --> 06:00.925
At least not twice.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.579
I'm not talking about Ashley.

06:02.623 --> 06:05.321
Uh, backsliding is a condition
that occurs in amnesia victims,

06:05.365 --> 06:08.150
and it's when they forget things
that they've already remembered.

06:08.193 --> 06:10.108
And it usually occurs

06:10.152 --> 06:12.807
when they're far from
their main memory source.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.286
I think he means you.

06:14.330 --> 06:17.115
Oh, it probably won't happen
to Liam, so don't worry.

06:17.159 --> 06:19.030
Oh, I'm not worried.
Don't you worry about that.

06:19.074 --> 06:20.380
All right, then neither
of us are worried.

06:20.423 --> 06:21.381
Good night.Good night.

06:21.424 --> 06:22.860
Good night.Night.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.079
Unbelievable.

06:24.122 --> 06:26.473
I know. He's so good
with that cane.

06:26.516 --> 06:30.172
Though it does look like
backsliding is a thing.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.000
Seriously?

06:32.043 --> 06:34.219
Liam was just starting
to remember things.

06:34.263 --> 06:37.614
I can't have him here alone,
at home, forgetting.

06:37.658 --> 06:40.225
Take him with you.He still wants us
to take it slow.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.531
Cancel the trip, then.

06:41.575 --> 06:45.753
Or I could have thought
of an even better idea

06:45.796 --> 06:47.711
while you were talking,
which I did.

06:49.670 --> 06:53.108
You may want to order
another one of those.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.501
Why, are you paying for it?

06:54.544 --> 06:57.591
No. When you told me
to stay away from Vanessa,

06:57.634 --> 06:59.419
was that because you didn't
want me near your client

06:59.462 --> 07:01.769
or your stepdaughter?

07:01.812 --> 07:04.511
I don't know what
you're talking about.

07:04.554 --> 07:07.122
You are using Monica
to get Vanessa a record deal.

07:07.165 --> 07:09.820
That's why you came back.
Not because you missed them.

07:09.864 --> 07:12.170
I love all of my children,
Michael.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.259
No, you need them.

07:14.303 --> 07:17.088
Are you going to get
to the point?

07:18.786 --> 07:21.136
Yeah. I'm giving you one day

07:21.179 --> 07:22.572
to tell Jeff and Monica
the truth.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.313
One day.

07:24.356 --> 07:26.663
Or... I'll do it myself.

07:29.623 --> 07:31.625
ADAM:
I wanted to ask for a truce.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.715
Please don't roll
your eyes at me.

07:34.758 --> 07:37.979
Wait, can you actually see?

07:38.022 --> 07:39.502
No, I can't.
I just asked Nadia

07:39.546 --> 07:41.243
to let me know if
you made a face at me.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.594
I'll just be over here.

07:44.638 --> 07:47.249
Look, Father wants this to be
a memorable Thanksgiving,

07:47.292 --> 07:49.294
so I'd like to do
something special for him,

07:49.338 --> 07:53.037
and I-I'd like your help.

07:53.081 --> 07:54.212
I would like to bake
a pie for Blake

07:54.256 --> 07:55.605
that he loved
as a child.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.389
It's from this recipe I found
when I first moved in,

07:57.433 --> 07:58.390
from his great-grandmother,

07:58.434 --> 08:00.958
who tragically died in a fire.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.134
Which seems to be a recurring
theme around here.

08:03.178 --> 08:04.919
But if you're not interested,
I get it.

08:04.962 --> 08:08.531
No... I'll do it.

08:08.575 --> 08:11.229
I'll help. For Blake.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.102
I'll see you tomorrow.

08:14.145 --> 08:16.496
Not if I see you first.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.369
That went well.

08:20.412 --> 08:22.023
It did.

08:22.066 --> 08:24.329
Now tell me why you really
asked her for help,

08:24.373 --> 08:25.635
and then what I can do.

08:27.942 --> 08:30.161
You really do know me.

08:38.996 --> 08:40.215
Our hotel is a ghost town,
Anders.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.783
50% occupancy
during the holiday season?

08:42.826 --> 08:44.436
We should be turning
people away.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.047
But no one's booking
because they're afraid

08:46.090 --> 08:48.266
of getting kneecapped,
like Victor.

08:48.310 --> 08:49.616
Well, I'm sure they'll
change their mind

08:49.659 --> 08:50.834
when you explain that

08:50.878 --> 08:53.228
two kneecappings occurring
in the same hotel

08:53.271 --> 08:54.229
is very unlikely.

08:56.797 --> 08:59.800
Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.
May I help you?

08:59.843 --> 09:03.325
And that's six minutes
it took for you to ask me.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.370
I'm Fletcher Myers.

09:05.414 --> 09:07.111
The PR guy that owed
Fallon Carrington a favor.

09:07.155 --> 09:08.939
Oh, oh, yes, yes-yes-yes.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.245
Thank you so much for coming.

09:10.288 --> 09:11.420
So, where do we start?

09:11.463 --> 09:12.421
You can tell me what
you've done so far

09:12.464 --> 09:13.814
to deal with the fallout.

09:13.857 --> 09:17.121
Well, I called everyone
who canceled and I told them

09:17.165 --> 09:19.559
about our new, hidden security
cameras we installed.

09:19.602 --> 09:22.431
And how many of them rebooked
after learning they were going

09:22.474 --> 09:24.172
to be secretly recorded 24/7?

09:26.696 --> 09:28.263
I'm beginning to see
the problem here.

09:29.525 --> 09:30.657
I think he's referring to you.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.572
Yeah, I get it.

09:32.615 --> 09:35.313
I don't know, I've never written
something like this before.

09:35.357 --> 09:37.315
I'm used to novels.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.926
Well, an article
is just a novel

09:38.969 --> 09:40.405
for someone with ADHD.

09:40.449 --> 09:42.146
It's all writing, you know,
you just put a pen to paper

09:42.190 --> 09:43.452
and let the process flow.

09:43.495 --> 09:47.151
The important thing is
that you are here with me.

09:48.109 --> 09:49.458
To write an article

09:49.501 --> 09:50.720
about the hotel's history.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.504
And I'm here to meet
with Landon.

09:52.548 --> 09:55.290
Who is, oddly, walking
over here right now.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.944
Okay, please be cool.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.641
Landon.

09:58.685 --> 10:00.600
L.R.?L.T.?

10:04.691 --> 10:06.301
LIAM:
Oh, my God!

10:06.344 --> 10:09.347
L.R., L.T., can I get a T.O.?

10:09.391 --> 10:10.610
What's going on?
You guys know each other?

10:10.653 --> 10:12.176
Hell yeah. He gave me
my first internship

10:12.220 --> 10:13.395
when I was studying in London.

10:13.438 --> 10:14.831
Which could have become
a full-time position

10:14.875 --> 10:16.093
if he hadn't decided

10:16.137 --> 10:18.052
to become a cliché
and traverse the world,

10:18.095 --> 10:20.358
like some type of
beautiful Viking.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.579
Wow. So when I told you
I wanted to meet

10:23.623 --> 10:25.102
with a British creative director
named Landon,

10:25.146 --> 10:26.713
you didn't think to tell me
you knew him?

10:26.756 --> 10:28.671
Well, I didn't know
it was thisLandon.

10:28.715 --> 10:31.239
And I've also always
known him as L.T.

10:31.282 --> 10:32.457
And you said
he was English

10:32.501 --> 10:33.894
when he is...
Welsh.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.810
Ah, silly me. I'm Fallon
Carrington. Hi. From America.

10:36.853 --> 10:38.202
Delighted.

10:38.246 --> 10:39.421
It's brilliant
to see you, mate.You, too.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.423
Didn't expect
to find you here.

10:41.466 --> 10:42.903
Not exactly one
for hunting.

10:42.946 --> 10:45.253
I'm actually writing an article
about this place

10:45.296 --> 10:46.907
for Fallon's
upcoming magazine.

10:46.950 --> 10:49.126
Thank you. Yes, I, uh, would
love to talk to you about it.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.955
I actually have
an opportunity that I think

10:51.999 --> 10:54.218
you'll be very, very interested
in. If you're free to chat?

10:54.262 --> 10:56.133
For this bloke,
I'll do anything.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.352
Hey.
Onward.

10:57.395 --> 10:58.309
How are you?I'm good.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.485
Good.

11:00.529 --> 11:01.791
No sharp knives.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.445
I am at a slight disadvantage.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.360
I'm not gonna
stab you, Adam.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.449
Staff is gone, and I don't know
where they keep the silverware.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.930
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Hmm.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.454
All right,
what am I doing?

11:14.369 --> 11:18.460
♪ Everybody's working
for the weekend ♪

11:20.331 --> 11:21.550
Oh, sorry.

11:21.593 --> 11:24.379
♪ Everybody needs
a second chance ♪

11:24.422 --> 11:26.337
Here we go.♪ Oh

11:26.381 --> 11:29.558
♪ You want a piece of my heart

11:29.601 --> 11:32.735
♪ You better start
from the start ♪

11:32.779 --> 11:35.738
♪ You want to be in the show

11:35.782 --> 11:38.567
♪ Come on, baby, let's go.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.398
Blake is gonna love this.

11:44.791 --> 11:46.270
I should actually
go check on him.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.969
Could I ask you a favor?
Would you lead me to the stairs?

11:49.012 --> 11:50.753
I forgot my cane.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.320
Let's go.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.365
Thank you.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.784
DOMINIQUE:
Why didn't you tell me

12:21.828 --> 12:23.743
Michael Culhane knows
you're my stepdaughter?

12:23.786 --> 12:26.658
How...? Who told you?

12:26.702 --> 12:30.880
He did. Now everything that
we've worked for is in jeopardy.

12:30.924 --> 12:32.577
Because you wanted
to share your feelings

12:32.621 --> 12:34.710
with some man you barely know.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.799
I didn't tell him.
He figured it out.

12:36.843 --> 12:39.541
And I didn't tell you because
I thought you'd freak out,

12:39.584 --> 12:41.238
which, clearly,
I was right about.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.285
The plan was

12:44.328 --> 12:47.244
to get Monica to sign you
beforewe told her the truth.

12:47.288 --> 12:50.508
Now Michael Culhane has given me
one day to come clean,

12:50.552 --> 12:52.597
or he does it himself.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.643
I'm sorry.

12:54.686 --> 12:56.906
Maybe this is
a good thing.

12:56.950 --> 12:58.429
Maybe we should
come clean.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.431
Monica seems great,

13:00.475 --> 13:02.782
and I feel terrible
lying to her.

13:04.305 --> 13:06.176
So I can do it if you want.

13:08.309 --> 13:12.095
You've known Monica for
five minutes, Vanessa.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.662
It needs to come from me.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.142
Keep working.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.361
Maybe consider adding "barista"

13:17.405 --> 13:18.580
to your résumé,

13:18.623 --> 13:20.016
because if this goes badly,

13:20.060 --> 13:21.670
you're going to need it.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.850
Basically, you handled
the McCarty plaque situation

13:27.894 --> 13:29.330
the wrong way, and I'm here

13:29.373 --> 13:31.288
to stop you from doing
that same thing again.

13:31.332 --> 13:32.855
I'm not sure
I like your tone.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.161
You didn't hire me
for my charm.

13:34.204 --> 13:36.467
Good, because I was about
to ask for a refund.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.818
And the McCarty thing
was not my fault.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.298
I've done everything
I can to make it go away.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.518
Exactly my point. I don't know
if you're trying to work out

13:43.561 --> 13:45.041
some trauma from your childhood

13:45.085 --> 13:47.739
or recent history,
but you can't fix the past, Sam.

13:47.783 --> 13:50.264
Well, you're really great
at telling me what I can't do,

13:50.307 --> 13:51.613
but what can youdo?

13:53.354 --> 13:54.659
There's the, uh,

13:54.703 --> 13:56.923
secret but not-so-secret
donation,

13:56.966 --> 13:58.402
or the new management option,

13:58.446 --> 14:00.230
or maybe
the Good Samaritan move.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.102
Really depends on which way
you want to go

14:02.145 --> 14:04.321
and what you want
this hotel to be.

14:04.365 --> 14:05.932
You think that I'm the
one stuck in the past,

14:05.975 --> 14:08.935
but you are the one pitching
recycled ideas to fix my hotel.

14:08.978 --> 14:11.415
What's your plan, then?

14:11.459 --> 14:12.982
Telling the truth.

14:13.026 --> 14:14.288
Oh.
I'll use social media

14:14.331 --> 14:16.638
to explain what really
happened with Victor

14:16.681 --> 14:18.422
and how it will
never happen again.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.729
Yeah. Good luck with that.

14:22.426 --> 14:24.689
I've often wanted
a touch of amnesia. How is it?

14:24.733 --> 14:27.475
Ah, well, it was definitely
weird to hear that I was engaged

14:27.518 --> 14:28.955
to a woman
I didn't recognize,

14:28.998 --> 14:30.826
published a book that
I don't remember writing,

14:30.870 --> 14:32.872
and learned that I missed
three seasons of Queer Eye.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.135
Oh, so much frothy melodrama
to catch up on.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.485
Uh, speaking of frothy,
my magazine...

14:37.528 --> 14:39.966
So, how did Mother Laura take
all of this excitement?

14:40.009 --> 14:41.358
Well, you know
my mother.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.490
Intimately.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.057
Oh, right.

14:44.100 --> 14:45.319
Right.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.408
Two years ago.

14:47.451 --> 14:48.844
Aunt Mora's
New Year's Eve party.

14:48.888 --> 14:49.889
You recall that?

14:49.932 --> 14:51.412
LIAM:
Oh, yeah.

14:51.455 --> 14:53.501
And I really wish
I didn't now, you... dog.

14:53.544 --> 14:56.373
As much as I would love

14:56.417 --> 14:59.072
to discuss Laura Van Kirk's
sex life all day and all night,

14:59.115 --> 15:01.509
um, I do have a presentation
I'd love to show you...

15:01.552 --> 15:03.511
Right, but first, what about
this article of Liam's?

15:03.554 --> 15:06.862
Oh, like I said, it's a... it's
a piece on the lodge's history.

15:06.906 --> 15:07.950
Apparently,
this oil lamp

15:07.994 --> 15:09.647
once belonged
to President John Tyler.

15:09.691 --> 15:12.128
Yes, but that's
just one article.

15:12.172 --> 15:15.044
We are still looking to solidify
our creative direction.

15:15.088 --> 15:17.090
That is where you come in. Now,

15:17.133 --> 15:19.309
if you want, we can go somewhere
a little more quiet to talk?

15:19.353 --> 15:21.485
I'd love to, but I don't quite
have the time now.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.923
The men's club awaits.
So how about we meet

15:23.966 --> 15:25.925
for afternoon tea? You'll have
my full attention then?

15:25.968 --> 15:28.405
That's fine.
Liam and I were gonna go...

15:28.449 --> 15:29.972
Liam, would you
like to join me?

15:30.016 --> 15:31.756
There's a lot of history
with the men's club

15:31.800 --> 15:33.584
that could help
with the article.

15:33.628 --> 15:35.673
Devil's in the details,
I always say.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.414
I mean,
the insider's perspective

15:37.458 --> 15:39.547
could be really good for this.
You're okay with that, right?

15:39.590 --> 15:42.376
Yeah, but I thought...Look, I promise you are
gonna love this article.

15:42.419 --> 15:43.159
Okay?

15:43.203 --> 15:44.378
We'll talk later.

15:44.421 --> 15:45.901
Mm-hmm.Let's go.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.947
Yes.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.355
Is something burning?

16:06.443 --> 16:07.923
Hello? Anyone?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.446
I smell...

16:09.490 --> 16:11.361
Oh.

16:11.405 --> 16:12.536
Oh, no.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.973
Yeah, I'm guessing that's

16:14.016 --> 16:15.496
not how the pie's supposed
to smell.

16:15.539 --> 16:16.584
No, Adam.

16:16.627 --> 16:18.325
The pie is black now.

16:18.368 --> 16:19.935
What? Why?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.023
Did you set
the temperature wrong?

16:21.067 --> 16:22.459
I did exactly what
you told me to do.

16:22.503 --> 16:23.895
I don't know
what happened.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.245
Of course this would happen

16:25.288 --> 16:27.421
on the one day I needed
everything to be perfect.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.945
Well, we have a
couple of hours.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.468
Maybe we can
make a new one.

16:31.512 --> 16:32.948
No, we're out of pecans.

16:32.992 --> 16:34.254
I got these special
caramelized pecans

16:34.297 --> 16:35.559
from this lady
down in Whitewater Creek.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.257
First, Great-Grandma Rudy

16:37.300 --> 16:39.476
dies in a fire,
and now her pie does as well?

16:39.520 --> 16:40.695
I mean...

16:42.697 --> 16:44.873
I guess I could drive
and get the pecans.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.483
Are you sure?I can see

16:46.527 --> 16:48.050
how much this matters to you.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.574
And how much it will
matter to Blake.

16:51.619 --> 16:53.621
Thank you.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.105
Here's your Manhattan, sir.

16:59.148 --> 17:02.021
Thank you, Darren.Of course.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.284
Mr. Anders referred to it
as your "afternoon pick-me-up."

17:06.025 --> 17:07.591
Is there a problem?

17:07.635 --> 17:10.464
Look, I'm fine with the changes
to the Thanksgiving menu,

17:10.507 --> 17:12.509
even your more modern
dressing habits,

17:12.553 --> 17:15.382
but please don't mess with an
Anders Manhattan, all right?

17:15.425 --> 17:17.079
Some things are sacred.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.125
I'll do it better next time.

17:21.692 --> 17:24.086
Are you watching news
about Blake?

17:24.130 --> 17:26.088
No, it's much worse.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.830
Uh, people are responding to
your social media proclamations.

17:28.873 --> 17:32.616
Much worse? What do you mean?

17:32.660 --> 17:36.185
#LaMirageLaGarbage.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.492
#SammyJoke. What...?

17:38.535 --> 17:41.321
#WorstHotelierInATL.

17:41.364 --> 17:42.887
This is, this is terrible.

17:42.931 --> 17:44.585
Well, it may not be the most
creative hashtag in the world,

17:44.628 --> 17:45.803
but it's not terrible.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.501
It gets its point across.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.459
Now news outlets
are picking up on the story.

17:49.503 --> 17:50.591
Perhaps Fletcher Myers
might have known

17:50.634 --> 17:52.636
what he was talking about.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.639
Anders, you only liked him
because he had a binder.

17:55.683 --> 17:57.032
I've input his number.

17:57.076 --> 18:01.254
Just press call, apologize,
and ask for help.

18:07.129 --> 18:09.349
Hey, Fletcher, it's Sam Jones.

18:09.392 --> 18:11.525
I just wanted to...

18:11.568 --> 18:13.527
Well, you couldn't have been
expecting my call,

18:13.570 --> 18:15.224
because I just decided
to make it, so...

18:15.268 --> 18:16.791
You know,

18:16.834 --> 18:20.011
you are just as obnoxious on
the phone as you are in person.

18:20.055 --> 18:21.926
You know what? I'm good.
I don't need your help.

18:21.970 --> 18:25.539
I already have
a great idea, so bye.

18:25.582 --> 18:28.585
Remind me to work with you
on the art of the apology.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.587
Can we put the sass on hold?

18:30.631 --> 18:33.242
I need to come up
with a great idea fast.

18:35.288 --> 18:36.680
Any great ideas?

18:36.724 --> 18:38.247
LIAM: Crazy...

18:38.291 --> 18:42.469
Apologies. We, uh, seem to
have lost track of time.

18:42.512 --> 18:44.471
Yes, well, I
understand.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.951
I seem to have lost track
of time myself.

18:46.995 --> 18:48.953
But the good news is
the waitstaff here loves me now.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.346
Except for Beth,

18:50.390 --> 18:52.609
who's been trying to take
my order for two hours.

18:52.653 --> 18:54.176
So maybe we should just
tell her what we want

18:54.220 --> 18:55.786
and then I'll dive right in.

18:55.830 --> 18:58.180
I'm actually quite knackered.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.182
I need to meditate
before the turkey hunt.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.750
I have shoddy aim
when I'm unfocused.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.099
Let's reschedule

19:04.143 --> 19:06.101
the business chitchat
for later tonight.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.276
After the hunt? Brilliant.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.451
I'll be in touch.

19:10.714 --> 19:11.846
Uh-oh.

19:11.889 --> 19:13.413
You're mad.Liam.

19:13.456 --> 19:16.590
I understand that your memory
is not what it used to be,

19:16.633 --> 19:17.982
so I will remind you
that we are here

19:18.026 --> 19:20.333
because I have
an important business deal

19:20.376 --> 19:21.551
that I need to close.

19:21.595 --> 19:22.552
Not so you and Landon

19:22.596 --> 19:24.075
can act like frat bros.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.468
I know, all right, I'm sorry.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.122
But I got a ton of great
material for the article.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.689
I'm almost finished.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.995
And this exclusive turkey hunt
sounds absolutely insane.

19:31.039 --> 19:33.128
And, I mean, I'm starting
to remember things.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.522
Like, uh,
when we went to Miami.

19:35.565 --> 19:37.915
Yes, that's right.
We went to Art Basel.

19:37.959 --> 19:41.267
No, I meant when Landon
and I went to Miami.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.659
You and I went to Art Basel?

19:43.617 --> 19:46.272
Liam, we literally just
talked about this yesterday.

19:46.315 --> 19:47.708
You know what?
That's not the point.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.013
I've had enough.

19:49.057 --> 19:51.320
Landon would not be ducking me
if I were a man.

19:51.364 --> 19:53.540
And no one ducks
Fallon Carrington.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.806
Gobble, gobble.

19:58.849 --> 20:02.070
No solicitors, please.
You can go.

20:02.113 --> 20:05.856
I found something last night.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.510
You always loved Thanksgiving.

20:07.554 --> 20:08.729
I thought you might

20:08.772 --> 20:10.948
want it back to remember
the good moments.

20:10.992 --> 20:13.168
Wow.

20:13.212 --> 20:17.303
This is the most maternal thing
you've done, ever.

20:17.346 --> 20:21.524
Listen... we need to talk.

20:21.568 --> 20:24.223
Yeah, we do.

20:25.398 --> 20:28.314
I'm sorry I was so icy
to you yesterday.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.446
With Jeff away
on business

20:30.490 --> 20:34.276
and Dad visiting family,
I've felt a little lonely.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.322
I know the feeling.

20:36.365 --> 20:38.759
I was thinking,

20:38.802 --> 20:41.370
maybe a mother-daughter reunion
wouldn't be the worst thing.

20:41.414 --> 20:42.937
So I'm drafting
a contract

20:42.980 --> 20:44.765
for Vanessa to sing here.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.680
Then you and
I can start

20:46.723 --> 20:50.379
a professional relationship
and go from there.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.599
Really?She's good.

20:52.642 --> 20:55.123
And she doesn't deserve to be
ignored because of our problems.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.516
So,

20:56.559 --> 20:58.735
your turn. What's up?

20:58.779 --> 21:01.085
I...

21:01.129 --> 21:03.131
I'm glad you feel that way.

21:03.174 --> 21:05.742
Do you want to join me

21:05.786 --> 21:07.178
for Thanksgiving
dinner tonight?

21:07.222 --> 21:08.441
I'm housesitting at Jeff's.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.094
And you can bring Vanessa.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.879
I'd love to get
to know her better.

21:11.922 --> 21:14.490
I'd love nothing more.

21:23.717 --> 21:26.633
Ugh. What the...?

21:32.073 --> 21:34.684
Of course.

21:56.358 --> 21:57.533
All right, hunters,
get your mouth callers

21:57.577 --> 21:58.665
in order before we split
into small groups.

21:58.708 --> 22:00.928
Hold your weapons, boys.

22:00.971 --> 22:02.843
Fallon, this adventure
is invitation only.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.323
No offense intended.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.413
None taken, which is why I have
no intention of leaving.

22:07.456 --> 22:10.111
When I want something,
I go after it.

22:10.154 --> 22:11.373
And I want you, Landon.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.506
Let's see what you've got, then.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.377
Fallon Unlimited
is expecting a circulation

22:15.421 --> 22:16.726
of over half a million copies

22:16.770 --> 22:17.901
nationwide...

22:17.945 --> 22:19.773
I meant your skill,
not your business.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.601
Well, my skill is business.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.733
And with your input,
Fallon Unlimited

22:23.777 --> 22:25.039
could really
take off.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.519
Here, this presentation
might help.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.651
Connecting with nature
doesn't include 5G technology.

22:28.695 --> 22:31.437
Okay, but connecting
with the market does.

22:31.480 --> 22:32.873
You see, I really,

22:32.916 --> 22:34.483
really need you, Landon.

22:34.527 --> 22:36.398
You know, in a "willing to
wear blood sport outfits"

22:36.442 --> 22:37.399
kind of way.

22:37.443 --> 22:39.445
I think you look great.Thanks.

22:39.488 --> 22:40.750
Since we're talking business,

22:40.794 --> 22:42.883
Liam, I spoke to a contact

22:42.926 --> 22:45.059
about a writing job in London
that you'd be perfect for.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.713
Really?Wait. What?

22:46.756 --> 22:49.759
It's temporary, though you'd
need to move in two weeks.

22:49.803 --> 22:51.282
Wow.

22:51.326 --> 22:53.284
L.T., man,
that sounds incredible.

22:53.328 --> 22:55.374
Good thing we stumbled
upon each other.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.679
All right.

22:56.723 --> 22:59.290
Now, let's kill
some innocent turkeys.

23:01.858 --> 23:04.774
I was hoping maybe we could just
kill them with kindness.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.776
Get it?

23:06.820 --> 23:07.777
ANDERS:
Any luck?

23:07.821 --> 23:09.866
No ideas.

23:09.910 --> 23:11.955
And my Google search
for "hot PR genius

23:11.999 --> 23:13.653
"available to work
on Thanksgiving

23:13.696 --> 23:15.437
in greater Atlanta"
didn't give me anything

23:15.481 --> 23:17.831
other than a weird link to a
pornographic pilgrim video.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.573
Which I only watched twice.

23:20.616 --> 23:21.791
Take the day off.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.445
You've got tomorrow
to remake the hotel

23:23.489 --> 23:24.751
however you see fit.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.317
I will hold down
the fort tonight.

23:26.361 --> 23:27.971
What about Thanksgiving?

23:28.015 --> 23:29.538
Well, Kirby's away,

23:29.582 --> 23:31.932
and this holiday
doesn't mean that much to me.

23:31.975 --> 23:33.499
That's not true.

23:33.542 --> 23:34.891
I know how much you used to love
Thanksgiving at the manor.

23:34.935 --> 23:37.111
Well, maybe so.

23:37.154 --> 23:39.809
But the manor, unfortunately,
is no longer my home.

23:39.853 --> 23:42.116
As far as this holiday
is concerned,

23:42.159 --> 23:43.683
I am effectively homeless.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.859
Despite a healthy
bank account

23:45.902 --> 23:47.861
and a nicely appointed
new apartment, obviously.

23:47.904 --> 23:50.124
Anders, I think you just
gave me a really good idea.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.474
But I'm gonna need your help.

23:52.518 --> 23:53.954
BLAKE:
How can I help you?

23:53.997 --> 23:56.870
I just wanted to wish
my big brother a happy holiday.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.349
Ah.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.743
I need dirt
on your former driver.

24:00.787 --> 24:02.310
And I know you have it.

24:02.353 --> 24:04.355
Well, you also know I don't
give out anything for free.

24:04.399 --> 24:05.705
I don't expect you to.

24:05.748 --> 24:07.315
I have an offer.

24:07.358 --> 24:08.490
Give me what you have

24:08.534 --> 24:10.187
and you can be done
writing me checks.

24:10.231 --> 24:12.581
For good.

24:12.625 --> 24:14.540
You know what, Dominique?

24:14.583 --> 24:17.760
It would be worth it just
to get you out of my life.

24:17.804 --> 24:19.545
So, sure.

24:19.588 --> 24:21.155
I'll give you a copy.

24:27.248 --> 24:29.772
Just curious.
Do you have a file on me?

24:29.816 --> 24:31.557
Yes, and it just got bigger.

24:31.600 --> 24:35.778
Now, I have a family
photo to take, so...

24:35.822 --> 24:37.954
please leave.

24:38.955 --> 24:40.130
Ms. Watt.

24:40.174 --> 24:41.480
Thank you for taking time

24:41.523 --> 24:43.133
out of your holiday for us.Of course.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.005
I'd like to make this
a memorable moment.

24:45.048 --> 24:46.920
Maybe we pose here by the piano.

24:46.963 --> 24:49.009
Great. And it'll be just you
in the picture?

24:49.052 --> 24:50.271
No, no.
The rest of the family's coming.

24:51.620 --> 24:52.969
My wife and daughter
and ex-son-in-law,

24:53.013 --> 24:54.057
they'll be here any moment.

24:57.191 --> 25:00.281
Maybe I should just make
a quick call.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.893
JENNINGS :
You've reached
Cristal Carrington.

25:03.937 --> 25:05.808
Please leave me a...

25:05.852 --> 25:06.896
I don't have
a ton of time,

25:06.940 --> 25:08.768
so we should probably
get rolling

25:08.811 --> 25:10.117
and just take it
with whoever's here.

25:11.553 --> 25:12.772
ADAM:
Dad, is it time
for the picture?

25:12.815 --> 25:15.035
Y-Yes, Adam.

25:15.078 --> 25:16.384
Do you know where
everyone else is?

25:16.427 --> 25:17.864
I-I don't.

25:17.907 --> 25:18.995
I figured they
knew how important

25:19.039 --> 25:20.127
this family picture was.

25:20.170 --> 25:22.216
Especially Cristal.

25:22.259 --> 25:23.260
DOMINIQUE:
I'm here.

25:23.304 --> 25:24.784
And I'm family.

25:24.827 --> 25:26.263
I should be a part
of the picture.

25:26.307 --> 25:27.351
I-I can't believe this.

25:27.395 --> 25:28.657
I thought I made myself
very clear.

25:28.701 --> 25:30.006
I'm here, Dad.

25:30.050 --> 25:31.965
Why don't we take a photo,
just the two of us?

25:32.008 --> 25:33.270
It's our first
Thanksgiving together.

25:33.314 --> 25:34.968
Sounds peachy to me.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.059
Okay, don't move.
I'm gonna take a bunch.

25:50.505 --> 25:51.637
MAN:
May I have some more?

25:55.945 --> 25:57.686
It looks delicious.

25:59.732 --> 26:00.994
Wow.

26:01.037 --> 26:02.822
I had no idea
this many people would show up.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.737
Well, I must admit,
I thought the whole idea

26:04.780 --> 26:06.913
was a bit sketchy myself,
but, uh, I was wrong.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.741
It was inspired.

26:08.784 --> 26:09.785
Inspired by you.

26:09.829 --> 26:11.700
All that talk
about you feeling

26:11.744 --> 26:13.789
that you don't have
a home made me realize

26:13.833 --> 26:15.704
that there are actual
homeless people out there.

26:15.748 --> 26:17.488
Well, I hope you didn't
just realize that

26:17.532 --> 26:19.316
a couple hours ago.No, you know what I mean.

26:20.666 --> 26:23.538
Oh. He's homeless.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.540
It's all starting
to make sense now.

26:25.584 --> 26:26.802
ANDERS:
Well, if you'll excuse me,

26:26.846 --> 26:29.588
there is something
I need to care of.

26:30.893 --> 26:34.331
I'm not homeless.
I, uh, came here to apologize.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.247
And to congratulate you
for working with the shelter

26:37.291 --> 26:39.119
to make this happen
so quickly.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.729
Well, it's very gracious of you.

26:40.773 --> 26:42.078
But I owe you nothing.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.993
Fair.Mm-hmm.

26:44.037 --> 26:45.560
Made the local news,
by the way.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.475
The hotel's finally
getting some positive PR.

26:47.518 --> 26:49.999
Well, that's not
what this was about.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.653
Okay, that's a lie,

26:51.697 --> 26:54.264
but it was nice to do something
good for the people.

26:54.308 --> 26:56.963
Which is what the hotel
is all about anyway.

26:57.006 --> 26:59.922
Well, I'd be happy to make sure
the story goes wider.

26:59.966 --> 27:02.751
For free, as, uh,
as part of my apology.

27:02.795 --> 27:06.929
You know, you are kind of nice
when you're not being obnoxious.

27:06.973 --> 27:09.105
Don't get used to it.

27:12.979 --> 27:15.024
I'm late for Thanksgiving.

27:15.068 --> 27:16.722
I'm assuming
you've spoken to Monica?

27:17.723 --> 27:19.812
I got it from Blake.

27:19.855 --> 27:21.814
Now, as you can see,

27:21.857 --> 27:23.424
my brother has a lot on you.

27:23.467 --> 27:25.339
The last thing
we'd want

27:25.382 --> 27:28.168
is for your family to find out
some of the things you've done.

27:28.211 --> 27:30.910
It would destroy
your mother.

27:30.953 --> 27:32.215
What do you want?

27:32.259 --> 27:34.043
I want you
to do nothing.

27:34.087 --> 27:36.655
Don't say a word to Monica,
and your mother and your sister

27:36.698 --> 27:39.005
will never find out
about any of this.

27:39.048 --> 27:40.354
Does that seem fair?

27:40.397 --> 27:43.052
You're a Carrington.
Of course it's not fair.

27:43.096 --> 27:45.707
Aw... don't be
mad, Michael.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.887
Someday you'll thank me
for this.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.335
Turkey right ahead.

28:06.597 --> 28:07.903
It's not moving.

28:07.947 --> 28:09.818
Maybe because
it's a bush.

28:09.862 --> 28:13.169
Let me assess. Then
we'll proceed with 10-5.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.219
Hey. You okay?

28:19.262 --> 28:20.394
You seem a
little upset.

28:20.437 --> 28:23.571
Upset? Yeah, yeah.
You could say that.

28:23.614 --> 28:26.313
You know, I've been so busy
trying to charm Landon,

28:26.356 --> 28:28.794
I didn't realize that
he's just trying to charm you.

28:28.837 --> 28:30.012
You know, sometimes
I get so focused,

28:30.056 --> 28:31.666
I miss the thing
that's right in front of me.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.189
Are we talking
about that turkey?

28:33.233 --> 28:35.583
No! We're talking
about Landon.

28:35.626 --> 28:37.716
And London.
You and Landon in London,

28:37.759 --> 28:39.195
and how you can't
move there.

28:39.239 --> 28:41.676
Well, Fallon, I never said yes.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.070
I mean, oh, yeah, it sounds
like a great opportunity for me.

28:44.113 --> 28:45.767
What, an opportunity
to forget me?

28:45.811 --> 28:47.073
I mean,
think about it, Liam.

28:47.116 --> 28:48.727
Have you remembered
one new thing

28:48.770 --> 28:51.642
since you've
been here? About me?

28:51.686 --> 28:52.948
No, you haven't.

28:52.992 --> 28:54.994
And if you move away,
then you're gonna backslide

28:55.037 --> 28:57.431
all the way to 2012 if I'm
not there to keep an eye on you.

28:57.474 --> 28:59.302
Fallon, you're the one who
gave me this assignment
to begin with.

28:59.346 --> 29:01.696
Yeah, which I now realize
was a huge mistake.

29:01.740 --> 29:05.787
Okay? But I couldn't
leave you home alone.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.268
Did you make up an assignment
to get me to come here with you?

29:10.357 --> 29:11.793
Hmm?Yes.

29:11.837 --> 29:13.664
But only because
I was afraid

29:13.708 --> 29:15.275
that were you were
gonna forget us.

29:15.318 --> 29:18.365
And I thought that I could do
both things at the same time,

29:18.408 --> 29:20.802
but now I've just...
screwed up both.

29:20.846 --> 29:23.239
Yeah, well, you have a
better shot with Landon

29:23.283 --> 29:25.589
than you do with
me right now.

29:25.633 --> 29:27.417
Turkey!

29:28.418 --> 29:29.768
LANDON: Ow!

29:34.033 --> 29:35.730
Did you just shoot me?!

29:39.125 --> 29:40.822
Maybe.

29:45.174 --> 29:46.741
Landon, Landon,
I am so sorry, okay?

29:46.785 --> 29:48.961
It was an accident."Sorry" and "accident"
are two words

29:49.004 --> 29:50.789
that are not permitted
on a hunting trip.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.791
I respectfully decline
your job offer!

29:52.834 --> 29:54.836
No, but we have,
uh, great benefits

29:54.880 --> 29:56.055
and health insurance.

29:56.098 --> 29:58.144
They may not cover
preexisting conditions,

29:58.187 --> 29:59.710
but I could try
to pull some strings.

29:59.754 --> 30:01.451
Please get me away from her.

30:06.456 --> 30:09.372
I'm sure you have a lot
that you want to say right now,

30:09.416 --> 30:10.852
but maybe we could just
put a pause on it

30:10.896 --> 30:12.245
until we get home?

30:12.288 --> 30:15.161
I just can't believe
that you would invent a job

30:15.204 --> 30:16.858
just to keep me
close to you.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.425
So that's a no on the pause?

30:18.468 --> 30:20.775
Fallon, did you ever just
consider telling me the truth?

30:20.819 --> 30:22.211
You know, instead of
making up an assignment

30:22.255 --> 30:23.865
like I'm some eight-year-old
who needs

30:23.909 --> 30:25.084
to be kept busy.

30:25.127 --> 30:26.650
What kind of person does that?

30:26.694 --> 30:28.174
The kind of person who's afraid

30:28.217 --> 30:30.785
that if you're not with me,
then you'll forget about me.

30:30.829 --> 30:33.527
So what if I forget
a few things,

30:33.570 --> 30:34.833
Fallon?

30:34.876 --> 30:36.399
What is the big deal?

30:36.443 --> 30:40.795
The big deal is that
if you start forgetting things,

30:40.839 --> 30:42.841
one of those things might be us.

30:42.884 --> 30:44.190
And that really
scares me,

30:44.233 --> 30:46.757
because I don't know
if I could start over.

30:46.801 --> 30:49.108
I don't know if I can make you
fall in love with me again.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.892
I mean, it was kind of

30:50.936 --> 30:52.894
a miracle that it happened
in the first place,

30:52.938 --> 30:55.201
so you just really need
to cut me some slack.

30:55.244 --> 30:58.247
I mean, Liam, you have no idea
how hard this has been for me.

30:58.291 --> 30:59.901
Hard for you?

30:59.945 --> 31:00.902
Yeah.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.904
Fallon, I have to face

31:02.948 --> 31:06.081
the uncertainty of restarting
in every aspect of my life,

31:06.125 --> 31:08.083
not just our
relationship,

31:08.127 --> 31:10.781
so I am sorry if
this is hard on you.

31:10.825 --> 31:12.566
But you don't have to restart
if you don't want to.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.916
I'm the one here who
doesn't have a choice.

31:22.271 --> 31:25.535
Happy Thanksgiving, sir.Thank you, Darren.

31:25.579 --> 31:26.667
ADAM:
Smells great.

31:26.710 --> 31:27.886
And trust me,
it looks delicious.

31:27.929 --> 31:29.496
ADAM:
Look, I know

31:29.539 --> 31:31.846
it hurts that Cristal and Fallon

31:31.890 --> 31:34.849
and, uh, I guess,
even Sam aren't here,

31:34.893 --> 31:36.764
that they missed
the family picture,

31:36.807 --> 31:37.939
but I'm here, Father,

31:37.983 --> 31:39.332
and I'm so glad

31:39.375 --> 31:41.029
that I can be
the one you can count on.

31:42.944 --> 31:43.858
Well, I guess

31:43.902 --> 31:45.468
I should start carving.

31:45.512 --> 31:47.818
Seeing as how little the rest
of my family cares about me.

31:47.862 --> 31:48.994
JENNINGS:
Wait. I'm here.

31:49.037 --> 31:50.821
I'm so sorry. Just
give me five minutes

31:50.865 --> 31:52.388
to freshen up--
I'll be right back.

31:57.045 --> 31:58.960
This is what happens
when you listen to your gut.

31:59.004 --> 32:02.964
From now on, La Mirage will be
the hotel with a good heart.

32:03.008 --> 32:04.574
Well, thank you.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.054
Mm.

32:06.098 --> 32:08.970
And I should apologize for
calling you an arrogant ass.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.624
You never called me that.

32:10.667 --> 32:14.410
Oh, then, I guess
I must have thought it.

32:14.454 --> 32:15.890
No, but, really, I-I...

32:15.934 --> 32:18.197
should apologize
for being stubborn.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.634
This was my first Thanksgiving
post-divorce,

32:20.677 --> 32:23.506
and it's so not where I
thought I'd be a year ago.

32:23.550 --> 32:25.856
And I guess that's
why I acted the way I did.

32:25.900 --> 32:27.032
It was nothing personal.

32:27.075 --> 32:28.947
I figured.

32:30.165 --> 32:32.298
Because I can see
the hotel is not the only thing

32:32.341 --> 32:33.516
around here with a good heart.

32:43.483 --> 32:44.875
Uh... whoa.

32:46.573 --> 32:47.966
I was not expecting that.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.968
That's what made it so fun.

32:54.233 --> 32:55.886
You have
a great holiday, Sam.

32:55.930 --> 32:57.888
You, too.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.938
Looks like the evening got
a little more...

33:03.982 --> 33:06.680
interesting.Yeah. I...

33:06.723 --> 33:08.464
don't know where
that came from.

33:08.508 --> 33:09.813
Well, don't overthink it.

33:10.858 --> 33:13.034
On a completely different note,

33:13.078 --> 33:14.905
I think my work here's done.

33:14.949 --> 33:17.082
Good. Go home, get some rest.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.432
No, I don't mean tonight.
I mean...

33:19.475 --> 33:21.434
I'm done here with the hotel.

33:21.477 --> 33:23.653
For good.You're quitting?

33:23.697 --> 33:25.612
We both knew this wasn't
a long-term thing.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.483
I just wanted
to help you open the hotel

33:27.527 --> 33:29.964
and to teach you how to fly.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.140
And having watched
you today,

33:32.184 --> 33:33.576
you are flying like...

33:33.620 --> 33:34.882
Superman?

33:34.925 --> 33:37.276
Well, I was gonna say
like a butterfly,

33:37.319 --> 33:39.408
but if you prefer Superman,
that's fine with me.

33:42.063 --> 33:44.065
I'm really grateful
to you, Anders.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.762
But I know that you

33:45.806 --> 33:47.199
need to do what's right for you.

33:47.242 --> 33:49.244
And I think we both know
what that is.

33:49.288 --> 33:51.942
JENNINGS:
I am so sorry I was late.

33:51.986 --> 33:54.945
I had to buy something,
and my car got two flat tires,

33:54.989 --> 33:57.122
and for some reason
my phone stopped working.

33:57.165 --> 33:58.949
I couldn't even
get a cab

33:58.993 --> 34:01.082
because of the holidays.I needed you here
before dinner.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.692
But no, no, no,
you had to go shopping.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.346
Nothing's even open.
It's Thanksgiving.

34:04.390 --> 34:07.306
I wasn't shopping. I was
getting pecans for Adam.

34:07.349 --> 34:09.873
Oh. Yeah, of course,
you blame Adam.

34:09.917 --> 34:11.092
Say what you want
about him--

34:11.136 --> 34:12.789
and believe me,
you have said plenty--

34:12.833 --> 34:13.834
but he was the only one

34:13.877 --> 34:15.488
that was here for me
the entire time.

34:16.706 --> 34:18.795
I'm not blaming him.
I was helping him.

34:19.753 --> 34:21.450
He wanted to give you some joy

34:21.494 --> 34:23.061
before your trial

34:23.104 --> 34:24.845
by baking your favorite pie.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.847
And the reason he
stood by you all day

34:26.890 --> 34:29.371
was because you make him
feel like a problem.

34:29.415 --> 34:31.373
Which most of
the time he is.

34:31.417 --> 34:32.983
But he's also

34:33.027 --> 34:35.160
been a better person.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.076
And he's still your son.

34:41.731 --> 34:42.863
She's telling the truth.

34:42.906 --> 34:44.299
She really was
trying to help me.

34:45.735 --> 34:48.738
I'm sorry, I just wanted
this Thanksgiving to be perfect.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.392
Well, I think it comes
pretty close.

34:53.917 --> 34:54.962
Can I...

34:55.005 --> 34:55.963
finally start carving now?

34:56.006 --> 34:57.007
SAM:
Hola.

34:58.835 --> 35:02.143
Sorry. Is it too late for me to
change real quick and join you?

35:04.014 --> 35:07.627
Okay. Be right back.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.894
Before we go in,

35:13.937 --> 35:15.025
I want to apologize.

35:15.069 --> 35:16.288
And to thank you

35:16.331 --> 35:19.291
for taking the high road
and telling Monica.

35:19.334 --> 35:21.467
Everything is gonna
be so much better.

35:21.510 --> 35:22.685
I mean, we're already having

35:22.729 --> 35:25.035
our first Thanksgiving meal
as a family.

35:25.079 --> 35:27.168
One thing. Monica knows nothing.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.517
And we're going
to keep it that way for now.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.954
We have a contract to sign.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.697
BLAKE:
Okay. I think we are

35:34.741 --> 35:35.959
finally ready?

35:36.003 --> 35:37.309
Uh, smells great.

35:37.352 --> 35:38.701
Unfortunately, I do not,

35:38.745 --> 35:39.746
so if you could just
hold on one second,

35:39.789 --> 35:41.095
I'm gonna go shower.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.053
No, you are gonna sit
your ass down at this table,

35:43.097 --> 35:45.665
we are gonna eat
and be thankful!

35:45.708 --> 35:47.623
Okay. Um, sorry.

35:47.667 --> 35:48.929
I got here as fast as I could,

35:48.972 --> 35:50.539
given the circumstances.

35:50.583 --> 35:52.324
Oh, my God, you shot a turkey.

35:52.367 --> 35:55.327
: I didn't
shoot anything-- on purpose.

35:55.370 --> 35:56.763
BLAKE:
Now that we are

35:56.806 --> 35:59.418
finally together, granted,

35:59.461 --> 36:03.422
under the most excruciating
circumstances possible,

36:03.465 --> 36:05.337
I want to thank you all
for making it.

36:06.816 --> 36:08.209
How about a picture?

36:08.253 --> 36:10.211
The photographer left hours ago.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.430
So?

36:11.473 --> 36:13.214
DARREN:
Did someone
say "picture"?

36:13.258 --> 36:16.174
I got this. I took a few
night classes at Emory.

36:16.217 --> 36:17.784
Good boy.
Oh.

36:17.827 --> 36:19.002
Hey.
DARREN:
All right, everyone.

36:19.046 --> 36:20.003
What do you got?

36:20.047 --> 36:21.396
What is it?Look this way.

36:21.440 --> 36:23.093
Wait, Bo, what...?Oh, whoops.

36:23.137 --> 36:24.921
I accidentally pressed
the video. Sorry.

36:24.965 --> 36:26.445
Give me...

36:26.488 --> 36:27.620
I promise
I can do this.

36:27.663 --> 36:28.621
All right,
there we go.

36:28.664 --> 36:30.666
Everyone,
say "turkey."

36:30.710 --> 36:32.494
No.Who is this guy?

36:42.156 --> 36:43.549
We're thinking of opening a
Club Colby offshoot in New York.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.768
And if the brand does well,
who knows?

36:45.812 --> 36:47.727
You've come a long way
since the little girl

36:47.770 --> 36:49.555
who used to make
hand turkeys.

36:49.598 --> 36:50.773
Excuse me, that was art.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.166
DOMINIQUE:
It was cute.
I'll give you that.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.602
That's why I saved it.

36:55.256 --> 36:57.867
Yeah, it's great that
she saved your painting.

36:57.911 --> 37:00.827
It's not so great that she's
been lying to you for years.

37:00.870 --> 37:02.872
Vanessa.What is she talking about?

37:02.916 --> 37:05.527
Yeah, what am I
talking about, Mom?

37:05.571 --> 37:06.920
Wait. Mom?

37:06.963 --> 37:09.705
She's your...

37:09.749 --> 37:11.794
You're my...
We're sisters.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.711
Oh, hell no.

37:15.755 --> 37:17.844
Stepsisters.

37:17.887 --> 37:20.063
DARREN:
Time for dessert.

37:20.107 --> 37:22.152
Straight from the binder.BLAKE:
Thank you, Darren.

37:22.196 --> 37:25.591
Once again, I want to thank
you all for making it.

37:25.634 --> 37:27.375
I don't know where I'll be
this time next year,

37:27.419 --> 37:29.638
but hopefully it'll be
right here with all of you.

37:29.682 --> 37:31.249
In the meantime,

37:31.292 --> 37:35.688
I'm making you president of the
Carrington Foundation, Adam.

37:35.731 --> 37:36.993
FALLON:
When did you become

37:37.037 --> 37:38.778
such a softie?I'm going on trial for murder.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.170
It has a way of making you
look at things

37:40.214 --> 37:41.171
from a different perspective.

37:41.215 --> 37:42.782
He has a point.
Mm.

37:42.825 --> 37:45.393
Yeah, it shouldn't take that
to make you realize

37:45.437 --> 37:47.395
that being with the ones
you love is important.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.136
And no matter
what has happened--

37:49.179 --> 37:50.529
God knows we've been through
our share

37:50.572 --> 37:53.227
of drama and backstabbings...

37:53.271 --> 37:54.881
that's the past.

37:54.924 --> 37:57.231
And just the thought
that we're here together,

37:57.275 --> 37:59.712
despite everything, that is
enough to keep me going.

37:59.755 --> 38:00.887
You okay?

38:00.930 --> 38:02.845
Yeah.

38:04.630 --> 38:05.674
To family.

38:05.718 --> 38:07.110
ANDERS:
What about
really old friends

38:07.154 --> 38:09.374
and father figures
who wish to return?

38:12.551 --> 38:13.900
Oh, there's nothing
I'd like more.

38:15.510 --> 38:16.816
Darren.Hmm?

38:16.859 --> 38:18.818
You're fired.

38:23.953 --> 38:26.913
I thought you wanted to poison
Cristal in Blake's eyes.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.654
But when you had the chance...

38:28.697 --> 38:31.265
I know, I'm, I'm as surprised
as you, actually.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.007
All I know is something happened

38:34.050 --> 38:35.617
when she said
I was a better person.

38:35.661 --> 38:37.227
She's right.

38:37.271 --> 38:38.751
I think
you're pretty great.

38:38.794 --> 38:43.712
Yeah? Well, you've
been a good influence.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.323
I'm glad you're here.

38:45.366 --> 38:47.325
Mmm. Me, too.

39:03.776 --> 39:06.822
First thing you need is
a gag order on that prosecutor.

39:06.866 --> 39:09.216
And then if you can share
with me all the details you have

39:09.259 --> 39:10.957
on the jury selection,

39:11.000 --> 39:12.567
I can help.Yeah, let's worry
about that tomorrow.

39:12.611 --> 39:14.656
Right now I would kill
to have a Manhattan with you.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.658
It's the one thing that your
replacement couldn't get right,

39:16.702 --> 39:18.834
even when he went to the binder.

39:18.878 --> 39:20.053
Well, to be honest,

39:20.096 --> 39:21.446
I did put the recipe
in the binder,

39:21.489 --> 39:24.231
but I left out
my secret ingredient.

39:24.274 --> 39:26.233
Love.

39:27.277 --> 39:28.844
Oh, uh, well...

39:28.888 --> 39:30.933
I'm just joking, sir.
I'm joking.

39:30.977 --> 39:33.371
Cinnamon. I left
out the cinnamon.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.373
Love.

39:40.247 --> 39:41.857
What's that?It's ice cream.

39:41.901 --> 39:46.253
Like in The Notebook,
which we can watch right now.

39:46.296 --> 39:48.995
Okay, all right,
we'll watch it later.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.997
But you should take
the London job if you want it.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.999
Landon killed it.
You know,

39:53.042 --> 39:54.914
after my girlfriend
shot him in the ass.

39:54.957 --> 39:56.394
Am I still your girlfriend?

39:56.437 --> 39:58.004
Okay, all right.

39:58.047 --> 39:59.962
Yeah, not the point. I got it.

40:00.006 --> 40:02.835
But I did sneak a look
at your piece...

40:03.879 --> 40:05.272
...and I loved it.

40:05.315 --> 40:06.621
It'd be perfect
for the magazine.

40:06.665 --> 40:07.666
But instead
of keeping it

40:07.709 --> 40:10.016
for myself, I sent it out

40:10.059 --> 40:11.931
to a couple different editors
and publishers.

40:11.974 --> 40:14.281
So your phone will probably
be ringing all weekend.

40:15.325 --> 40:17.327
Thank you, I think.

40:17.371 --> 40:20.896
And you were right.
I was afraid of beginning again.

40:20.940 --> 40:22.724
But then I thought,

40:22.768 --> 40:24.900
if we do, then we can
make new memories.

40:24.944 --> 40:26.293
You know?
And forget the bad ones.

40:26.336 --> 40:27.773
Bad ones?

40:27.816 --> 40:32.865
The point is, if you are willing
to start over, so am I.

40:32.908 --> 40:34.519
So,

40:34.562 --> 40:35.824
take...

40:38.348 --> 40:40.916
Hi. I'm Fallon.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.356
I'm Liam.

40:49.098 --> 40:50.709
Okay.

40:54.060 --> 40:56.671
JENNINGS:
Adam.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.281
I wanted to talk to you.

40:58.325 --> 40:59.761
Me, too.

40:59.805 --> 41:01.981
I just want to say thank you

41:02.024 --> 41:03.983
for everything
you did today.

41:04.026 --> 41:07.116
And I'm so glad that we could
move past our differences.

41:07.160 --> 41:10.076
Do you honestly think I didn't
know what you were up to?

41:11.120 --> 41:12.470
I'm confused.

41:12.513 --> 41:14.602
The minute my car broke down,
I knew it was you.

41:14.646 --> 41:16.561
I just didn't
know how.

41:16.604 --> 41:18.214
But I saw you
and Nadia together,

41:18.258 --> 41:20.173
and then it
all made sense.

41:20.216 --> 41:23.176
I didn't say anything because
I didn't want to hurt Blake.

41:23.219 --> 41:25.831
But trust me,
you won't be here for long.

41:26.832 --> 41:27.833
So watch your step.

41:29.399 --> 41:32.925
Or... I guess that's what
your girlfriend is for, right?

41:40.802 --> 41:43.762
So? How's it going?

41:43.805 --> 41:46.199
He said he loves me.

41:47.461 --> 41:49.419
I've got him wrapped
around my little finger.

41:49.463 --> 41:51.987
Just like you wanted.

41:52.031 --> 41:56.557
Perfect. Something we
can all be thankful for.
