Hey, Eddie, I have an idea.

00:28.767 --> 00:31.000
Maybe I should dress up like
a janitor and follow her.

00:31.000 --> 00:32.834
No, no, no, wait,
I did that last week.

00:32.834 --> 00:34.500

Rae, why don't you just
ask Chels what's going on?

18:08.800 --> 18:10.567
(<i>both screaming </i>)

18:13.567 --> 18:15.667
Okay, Chels,
Chels...

18:15.667 --> 18:16.667
Yeah.

18:16.667 --> 18:17.767
Okay. Whoa!

18:17.767 --> 18:20.900
Oh, my...
Oh... Chels.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.100
Yeah?

18:22.100 --> 18:24.767
Um... I think something's
tickling my foot,

18:24.767 --> 18:27.300
but I don't really think
it's you.

18:29.500 --> 18:32.100
Rae, I think your boot
has a boyfriend.

18:32.100 --> 18:33.133
What?
Yeah.

18:33.133 --> 18:34.200
What is it, Chels?

18:34.200 --> 18:35.200
Well, Rae, it's a skunk.

18:35.200 --> 18:36.233
Ew, no!

18:36.233 --> 18:37.600
A skunk, ew!

18:37.600 --> 18:38.900
What do I do?

18:38.900 --> 18:41.667
Okay, just take off
your boot, okay,

18:41.667 --> 18:43.300
before he sprays us.

18:43.300 --> 18:44.300
You must be kidding.

18:44.300 --> 18:46.100
First my moisturizer,
now my boot?

18:46.100 --> 18:47.500
This is becoming
a very expensive weekend.

18:47.500 --> 18:48.500
Hurry up!

18:48.500 --> 18:49.834
All right!

18:51.467 --> 18:53.967
I did it. I did it.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.000
CHELSEA:
Uh-oh.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.767
(<i>screaming </i>)

19:11.367 --> 19:13.300
Chelsea, Raven?

19:13.300 --> 19:15.033
Chelsea, Raven?

19:15.033 --> 19:17.767
Chelsea?

19:17.767 --> 19:19.200
Chelsea, Raven!

19:19.200 --> 19:21.367
Oh!

19:21.367 --> 19:24.133
Oh, great, now I have
lost two kids.

19:24.133 --> 19:26.767
This might be hard to explain.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.667
(<i>coughing </i>)

19:37.667 --> 19:40.400
Chelsea, were you hiding
in the log this whole time?

19:40.400 --> 19:44.700
No, no. Uh... ah, well,
I-I was stuck in a rock

19:44.700 --> 19:46.867
and then Raven came
and rescued me.

19:46.867 --> 19:48.133
And then

19:48.133 --> 19:50.800
well, there was this bear
and then a skunk

19:50.800 --> 19:53.734
and then we rolled back
to camp in this log.

19:53.734 --> 19:57.500
Right and I am
Miss Dominican Republic.

19:58.700 --> 20:01.200
Any more taquitos left?

20:01.200 --> 20:04.200
Yeah, there... there's some.
Help yourself.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.500
Oh, and there's lemonade
in the fridge.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.600
Check that out.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.300
Whew.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.100
Oh, my goodness.

20:19.233 --> 20:21.800
I have never seen
so many stars.

20:21.800 --> 20:26.033
Yeah, you can't really see them
like this in the city, you know,

20:26.033 --> 20:28.400
with all the lights and stuff.

20:28.400 --> 20:32.400
Now I know why you like it
up here so much.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.000
You know what?

20:37.000 --> 20:40.667
I am sorry I never gave
this place a chance.

20:42.233 --> 20:44.600
It's okay.

20:44.600 --> 20:47.300
You don't have to love
the outdoors just 'cause I do.

20:47.300 --> 20:49.567
Yeah, I guess you're right.

20:49.567 --> 20:52.200
We can like different things
and still be best friends.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.800
Mm-hmm.

20:56.734 --> 20:58.200
It sure is beautiful.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.900
Yeah.

21:08.133 --> 21:09.300
Everybody.

21:09.300 --> 21:12.100
♪ I've got a pinecone,
yes, I do ♪

21:12.100 --> 21:15.467
♪ Throw them in the pot
and make pinecone stew. ♪

21:17.800 --> 21:20.100
Ooh, uh, yeah.
That's me.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.567
I'm sorry
about that, Chels.

21:21.567 --> 21:23.500
I forgot I was
baking peach cobbler.

21:23.500 --> 21:26.000
Peach cobbler?!

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
Ooh, I get dibs on the crust.

21:31.834 --> 21:34.734
I did it again.

21:34.734 --> 21:38.100
Well, you know,
you did sing the pinecone song,

21:38.100 --> 21:39.700
so I guess I could have
some cobbler.

21:39.700 --> 21:42.700
Yeah!
Come on.

21:45.133 --> 21:47.033
Hey, Rae, your boot's back.

21:47.033 --> 21:49.200
That is not my boot!

21:49.200 --> 21:54.000
(<i>screaming </i>)

21:54.000 --> 21:56.300
Why don't you just take
the other one, you nasty!

21:56.300 --> 21:59.900
