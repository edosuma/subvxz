WEBVTT

00:00.260 --> 00:03.961
You're a partner here.
The house needs to be maintained.

00:03.996 --> 00:06.564
It's a whorehouse,
not the Taj Mahal.

00:06.598 --> 00:08.867
Start showing me a return
on my investment.

00:08.902 --> 00:10.437
<i>That was beautiful.</i>

00:10.471 --> 00:12.606
I don't know who you are, mister,
but you just made a pal.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.676
I'm George Mueller with the
Farraday Electric Iron Company.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.113
Dean O'Banion.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.548
You fellas are going down

00:18.582 --> 00:19.849
and you're not
taking me with you.

00:19.883 --> 00:22.018
Starting soon I will be
accepting cash directly.

00:22.053 --> 00:23.220
<i>I have a middleman.</i>

00:23.254 --> 00:25.789
Dr. Mason,
I present to you

00:25.824 --> 00:29.061
<i>the future home of</i>
<i>St. Theresa's Women's Clinic.</i>

00:29.095 --> 00:31.697
Women's Health Clinic.
Free to all.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.099
Know what I'd like?

00:33.133 --> 00:35.869
To stay here forever.

00:35.903 --> 00:37.237
If I could.

00:38.473 --> 00:40.608
- This is a raid.

00:40.643 --> 00:43.745
Pay the fine direct to me
and we'll leave it at that.

00:43.779 --> 00:45.648
Why do I know you?

00:45.682 --> 00:48.751
- I have partners.

00:52.391 --> 00:54.859
I want what I paid for
and I want it now.

00:54.894 --> 00:58.897
- Nucky said to avoid Tabor Heights.
- You're not in charge.

00:58.932 --> 01:01.768
Gas up in Tabor Heights
and you stop for nobody.

01:01.802 --> 01:04.203
Wait!
It's an ambush!

01:04.238 --> 01:05.739
Stop!

01:07.676 --> 01:09.811
I have to talk to you.

03:15.285 --> 03:17.186
What the fuck
are you stopping for?

03:17.220 --> 03:18.921
- I'm hurting you.
- You're not hurting me.

03:18.955 --> 03:20.622
But you told me to hurt you.

03:20.657 --> 03:22.957
Then fucking hurt me!

03:39.508 --> 03:41.642
You okay?

03:43.645 --> 03:46.180
Mr. Rosetti?

03:46.215 --> 03:47.482
Gyp?

03:54.656 --> 03:57.091
Wet towel.

04:03.699 --> 04:05.901
I headed up there
as fast as I could.

04:05.935 --> 04:08.370
I tried to stop them,
they wouldn't listen.

04:08.404 --> 04:10.505
'Cause Mickey...

04:10.539 --> 04:13.809
'cause they were under
orders to get you

04:13.843 --> 04:15.643
<i>what you paid for.</i>

04:15.678 --> 04:18.579
- And yet you escaped.
- We lost 11 men.

04:18.613 --> 04:21.149
Was I supposed to get
myself killed, too?

04:25.421 --> 04:29.090
Rosetti controls the roads
in and out of Tabor Heights,

04:29.125 --> 04:31.326
taken up residence in the town,

04:31.361 --> 04:33.695
commandeered
the sheriff's department.

04:33.763 --> 04:36.264
He burned the sheriff.

04:36.299 --> 04:37.866
There are other routes.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.301
Don't you think
I've considered that?

04:39.335 --> 04:41.169
How about your million
dollar fucking highway?

04:41.204 --> 04:44.072
Must you swear
every time you speak?

04:44.106 --> 04:45.740
When did you become a Quaker?

04:45.775 --> 04:47.442
Firstly, it's no longer
my highway,

04:47.476 --> 04:50.178
and it costs considerably
more than a million dollars.

04:50.212 --> 04:52.780
Secondly, it's two years
away from being finished.

04:52.814 --> 04:55.850
Thirdly, the other routes
are not viable.

04:55.884 --> 04:57.020
What does that mean?

04:57.120 --> 04:58.720
To truck the quantities
you're talking about...

05:00.822 --> 05:02.956
Sorry, I interrupted.

05:03.891 --> 05:05.725
Go on.

05:06.760 --> 05:09.762
Well, between the mud
and the ice

05:09.796 --> 05:12.597
and the law, it's more
than we can manage.

05:12.632 --> 05:14.599
That's correct.

05:20.272 --> 05:22.340
Thanks for your input.

05:33.484 --> 05:36.286
Let's discuss our options.

05:38.022 --> 05:39.890
Our options?

05:39.924 --> 05:41.324
To solve this problem.

05:41.359 --> 05:43.827
How long have
you known Mr. Rosetti?

05:45.463 --> 05:47.598
A year or so. I don't know.
You were the one who introduced me.

05:47.632 --> 05:49.300
He kicks up to Joe Masseria.

05:51.369 --> 05:54.371
With whom I have
a very delicate truce.

05:54.406 --> 05:56.473
- Over what?
- <i>That's not your concern.</i>

05:56.507 --> 05:58.608
<i>But what might solve</i>
<i>a problem for you</i>

05:58.643 --> 06:00.777
creates a bigger one for me.

06:00.811 --> 06:02.645
And what would you do
about a mad dog?

06:02.680 --> 06:05.614
Before anything else, I'd
find out who its master was.

06:05.649 --> 06:08.151
Rosetti doesn't respect
any rules, Arnold.

06:08.185 --> 06:10.887
That makes him bad for
business, yours and mine.

06:10.921 --> 06:14.290
I'd like to talk to Mr.
Thompson in private, please.

06:23.568 --> 06:24.902
Bad for business?

06:24.936 --> 06:27.438
- Isn't it?
- What would you know about it?

06:27.472 --> 06:30.007
Conducting yours like
some drunken shopkeeper.

06:30.075 --> 06:32.677
All right, Arnold.
You're allowed to blow off steam.

06:32.711 --> 06:34.078
It's not all right.

06:34.112 --> 06:35.813
Do you think I entered
into this arrangement

06:35.847 --> 06:39.784
because I value
your companionship?

06:39.818 --> 06:42.319
You are a convenience

06:42.353 --> 06:44.755
of geography and supply.

06:44.790 --> 06:48.192
You promised a quantity
and a price.

06:48.227 --> 06:50.060
You have failed to deliver.

06:50.095 --> 06:53.597
And now, owing to your inability
to manage your own affairs

06:53.631 --> 06:55.165
in New Jersey,

06:55.199 --> 06:58.434
a state I have little interest
in or affection for,

06:58.469 --> 07:01.438
you expect me to start
a war in New York

07:01.472 --> 07:04.040
where things actually matter?

07:04.074 --> 07:07.643
I expect you to understand that Gyp
Rosetti is trouble for everyone.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.111
I lost an entire convoy.

07:09.146 --> 07:11.714
Because of your own
cavalierness.

07:11.748 --> 07:15.485
Because you run off to
Manhattan at a moment's notice

07:15.519 --> 07:17.688
to rut with some showgirl.

07:17.722 --> 07:20.557
- You'd be wise to leave Miss Kent
out of this. - Why? You can't.

07:20.591 --> 07:23.960
Do you even begin to understand
how weak that makes you look?

07:23.995 --> 07:26.496
That's a big noise from a man
who's dead below the waist.

07:26.531 --> 07:28.666
- I practice discretion.
- You practice bullshit.

07:28.700 --> 07:30.334
Who the fuck are you, Arnold?

07:30.368 --> 07:33.037
Aside from a little weasel
with a good poker face?

07:51.358 --> 07:53.192
- Charlie.
- A.R.

07:53.227 --> 07:54.961
Let's move on
to other business.

08:15.481 --> 08:17.482
Is there anything
I need to know?

08:17.516 --> 08:20.084
What time
is Billie's rehearsal?

08:20.119 --> 08:22.753
1:00.

08:24.256 --> 08:26.590
Take me to the house.

08:44.709 --> 08:46.877
Say, Georgie,
boss wants to see you.

08:46.912 --> 08:50.414
Did you perch a bucket of water
above his door jamb?

08:50.482 --> 08:53.484
Suspicious
son of a gun, ain't ya?

08:53.519 --> 08:56.921
What does he want
to see me about?

08:58.891 --> 09:01.760
Sounds like the feds
finally caught up with you.

09:17.945 --> 09:22.383
I got a call from the Bureau
of Internal Revenue.

09:25.987 --> 09:28.656
Where did you work before this?

09:32.294 --> 09:34.261
I thought I told you.

09:34.295 --> 09:37.664
I owned a wheat farm.

09:37.698 --> 09:41.134
And where was
this wheat farm exactly?

09:42.202 --> 09:45.938
Minnesota.
East of Ortonville.

09:47.774 --> 09:49.508
Now how hard was that?

09:49.542 --> 09:50.743
Sir?

09:50.777 --> 09:52.879
Your goshdang tax form,
it was incomplete.

09:55.582 --> 09:57.484
I don't have time for this
nonsense, George.

09:57.518 --> 09:59.553
<i>Your return is your own</i>
<i>responsibility.</i>

09:59.587 --> 10:02.957
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
Of course it is.

10:02.991 --> 10:06.360
Oh, George.
A fellow left this for you.

10:06.394 --> 10:08.061
Says he met you in a speak.

10:10.265 --> 10:12.566
Not thinking of turning
us in, are you?

10:55.879 --> 10:57.980
Don't stand on
my account, Leander.

10:58.015 --> 10:59.715
It hurts too much to sit.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.484
What's wrong?

11:01.518 --> 11:03.285
Encroaching decrepitude.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.989
I thought you Yankees
were supposed to be stoic.

11:06.023 --> 11:07.690
Do you know what consoles me?

11:07.725 --> 11:09.859
I can't imagine.

11:09.894 --> 11:12.495
That this entire world will
be overrun by corruption,

11:12.529 --> 11:16.199
ignorance, and perfidy, but I
won't be forced to witness it.

11:16.233 --> 11:18.835
That does sound comforting.

11:18.870 --> 11:21.405
But perhaps we can
talk about me now.

11:21.440 --> 11:25.410
I've got some marvelous ideas for
the club that I'm eager to realize.

11:25.444 --> 11:27.512
The traditional
house of pleasure

11:27.546 --> 11:30.982
is hopelessly mired in
an outdated, button-tufted...

11:31.049 --> 11:33.784
2,100 a month in.

11:33.819 --> 11:36.054
2,700 a month out.

11:36.088 --> 11:37.755
I do wish you'd let me finish.

11:37.789 --> 11:39.156
This is what you
pay me to tell you.

11:39.191 --> 11:41.092
Your costs exceed your revenue.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.728
Every business takes time
to find its footing.

11:43.762 --> 11:45.329
And that cannot continue.

11:49.068 --> 11:52.970
The roof lets in buckets.
That's 800.

11:53.005 --> 11:56.207
There's a crack in the foundation.
That's 1,000.

11:56.275 --> 11:58.076
The sewer pipes collapsed.

11:58.111 --> 12:00.579
I haven't had the stomach
to get an estimate on that yet.

12:00.613 --> 12:03.448
I need your help
to arrange a loan

12:03.482 --> 12:05.316
to make it through to summer.

12:05.351 --> 12:08.019
- It always picks up then.
- Don't you have a partner?

12:08.054 --> 12:11.390
Mr. Luciano and I differ on
how the club should be run.

12:11.425 --> 12:12.992
Then you have to resolve that.

12:16.797 --> 12:18.765
This place, Leander...

12:20.834 --> 12:23.870
it's meant to be a dream.

12:25.140 --> 12:29.743
Every man who walks inside
is young and handsome.

12:29.811 --> 12:32.412
Every girl is innocent,

12:32.447 --> 12:34.815
trusting, and devoted.

12:34.849 --> 12:38.585
The light is flattering,
the air is perfumed,

12:38.619 --> 12:41.555
and nothing ever changes.

12:41.589 --> 12:44.925
Who doesn't need
to believe that?

12:44.959 --> 12:46.126
<i>Just for a little while?</i>

12:46.160 --> 12:47.995
We've been through
this, Gillian.

12:48.029 --> 12:51.064
- There's the house for collateral.
- <i>You don't own the house.</i>

12:51.099 --> 12:53.166
- My son does.
- Tommy is not your son.

12:53.201 --> 12:55.402
And in any case,
he doesn't own it either.

12:55.436 --> 12:57.804
- It's in James's name.
- That's who I'm talking about.

12:57.839 --> 12:59.907
Well, then,
before anything else,

12:59.942 --> 13:02.443
the process of having
him declared dead...

13:02.478 --> 13:05.180
- I really don't see the point.
- If you refuse to acknowledge...

13:05.214 --> 13:07.215
<i>He's prone to long</i>
<i>disappearances.</i>

13:07.249 --> 13:09.584
He's always been
an adventurous boy.

13:09.618 --> 13:11.552
Gillian!

13:11.586 --> 13:14.989
Until James is declared dead,
you have no ownership.

13:15.023 --> 13:18.091
You have no title.
You have no credit.

13:18.125 --> 13:21.394
And you're wasting
an old man's time.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.954
- What do you think?
- Better.

13:44.989 --> 13:48.591
But, "Do you wish
for greater knowledge?"

13:48.626 --> 13:50.259
Well, don't you?

13:50.294 --> 13:52.362
It sounds vaguely mystical.

13:52.396 --> 13:56.633
I can hardly write,
"Come discuss your vagina."

13:56.667 --> 13:59.235
Couldn't you put
a picture on it somewhere?

13:59.270 --> 14:01.004
Kittens, maybe.

14:02.573 --> 14:04.341
Hello again.

14:04.375 --> 14:05.909
Ladies.

14:05.943 --> 14:09.446
- Philip didn't let you in?
- Mr. Thompson used his key.

14:12.316 --> 14:14.684
Would you excuse me?

14:16.954 --> 14:20.590
Well, Mr. Sleater, do you
wish for greater knowledge?

14:20.625 --> 14:23.127
- You can take your hat off.
- I'm not staying.

14:23.162 --> 14:26.631
Actually, I have business
out of town for a few days.

14:26.665 --> 14:29.533
You needn't have come
to tell me that.

14:29.567 --> 14:31.803
Just wanted to make sure
everything's all right.

14:31.837 --> 14:33.937
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

14:34.005 --> 14:36.240
Then what is it
you're making sure about?

14:36.275 --> 14:38.476
That my family is safe.
Can't I do that?

14:38.510 --> 14:41.612
Are there to be
bodyguards again?

14:41.647 --> 14:44.148
Don't give me
that look, please.

14:44.183 --> 14:46.784
- What look? - The one that says
you know what I'm thinking.

14:46.819 --> 14:50.421
The state of my soul.
What I had for breakfast.

14:50.455 --> 14:52.990
I'm fairly certain
what you had for breakfast.

14:53.025 --> 14:55.226
The rest I wouldn't dare
speculate about.

14:55.260 --> 14:57.161
Will you answer my question?

14:57.195 --> 15:00.898
It's just a precaution.
There's no cause for concern.

15:00.933 --> 15:04.569
And it makes me feel better.
Where are the children?

15:04.604 --> 15:06.137
Out with Lillian.

15:06.172 --> 15:08.606
Is that dangerous?

15:08.641 --> 15:11.009
No. I just thought I'd...

15:11.043 --> 15:14.679
anyway, I bought them
each a copy

15:14.714 --> 15:16.982
so there's no fighting.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.990
What was that about?

15:27.259 --> 15:29.461
He worries sometimes.

15:33.132 --> 15:35.700
He couldn't figure
it out either.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.702
What?

15:39.071 --> 15:41.873
<i>The committee calls</i>
<i>Treasury Secretary</i>

15:41.908 --> 15:44.709
<i>Mr. Andrew W. Mellon.</i>

16:06.000 --> 16:07.500
I am ready.

16:07.534 --> 16:09.368
Thank you for taking the time

16:09.402 --> 16:11.404
to come here today,
Secretary Mellon.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.842
I assume there is something
you wanted to ask me.

16:15.876 --> 16:17.210
<i>Indeed there is.</i>

16:17.244 --> 16:19.212
Could you speak
to the committee

16:19.246 --> 16:23.416
concerning your views on the state
of Prohibition at this time?

16:23.450 --> 16:26.786
My views on that subject
are well known.

16:26.821 --> 16:30.423
Nonetheless, could you
summarize, Mr. Secretary?

16:32.093 --> 16:34.694
Setting aside
my own personal view

16:34.729 --> 16:36.563
as to the questionable wisdom

16:36.597 --> 16:39.933
of pandering to the demands
of a minority,

16:39.968 --> 16:43.203
I believe I have been
quite clear that the cost

16:43.237 --> 16:46.573
of effectively policing this act
would be somewhere in the amount

16:46.608 --> 16:49.676
of 28 millions
of dollars per annum...

16:51.246 --> 16:53.947
approximately five times

16:53.981 --> 16:57.217
what Congress has seen fit
to authorize.

16:57.251 --> 17:00.287
Would you not consider that, sir,
throwing good money after bad?

17:00.321 --> 17:03.323
That is a question that would
have been better asked

17:03.357 --> 17:06.159
before the amendment
was voted on in 1919.

17:06.194 --> 17:08.595
May I remind my fellow senators

17:08.628 --> 17:11.765
that the focus of these
hearings is not enforcement,

17:11.799 --> 17:13.767
but prosecution?

17:13.800 --> 17:15.836
In that case,

17:15.869 --> 17:18.238
you are speaking
to the wrong man.

17:18.306 --> 17:20.874
Oh, we fully intend to call
Attorney General Daugherty

17:20.907 --> 17:22.342
before this committee.

17:22.377 --> 17:25.979
But what we're seeking today
is a sense of to what degree

17:26.012 --> 17:29.349
the efforts by your bureau
may or may not

17:29.383 --> 17:32.185
be undermined
by the Department of Justice.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.488
You have been presented
with tables

17:35.522 --> 17:38.091
laying out the number
of arrests

17:38.125 --> 17:39.726
versus the number
of convictions?

17:39.793 --> 17:42.362
I, um...

17:51.205 --> 17:52.672
Yes, we have it right here.

17:52.706 --> 17:55.875
Then you are free to draw
your own conclusions.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.710
I don't see what all
this pussyfooting is for.

17:57.745 --> 18:00.780
Mr. Mellon, are we talking
about gross incompetence

18:00.815 --> 18:04.617
inside the Justice Department
or widespread corruption?

18:04.652 --> 18:07.687
It is my experience

18:07.721 --> 18:11.157
that human nature leaves
ample room for both.

18:23.001 --> 18:24.902
Excuse me.

18:24.936 --> 18:28.839
I believe your left shoelace
is in a state of dishabille.

18:34.412 --> 18:36.346
Now Mellon is in
there talking to them.

18:36.414 --> 18:38.181
I ascertained that
already, Harvey.

18:38.215 --> 18:40.416
But what is he talking about?

18:40.451 --> 18:43.486
Your boss's dirty hands.

18:49.492 --> 18:52.795
Johnny was bashful and shy ♪

18:52.829 --> 18:55.498
♪ Nobody understood why ♪

18:55.532 --> 18:58.501
♪ Mary loved him ♪

18:58.535 --> 19:02.605
♪ All the other girls

19:02.639 --> 19:06.609
♪ Everyone wanted

19:06.643 --> 19:08.444
- Hold it!
- Can we stop?

19:08.479 --> 19:11.480
- Iron out the steps there, Vern.
- Yup.

19:11.515 --> 19:14.884
By the piano, please.
Move by the piano.

19:14.918 --> 19:16.886
It is not you.
It is not you.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.754
- Gonna go from right before
the dip. - Okay.

19:18.789 --> 19:21.290
You're leaning in here.
Going primp out,

19:21.324 --> 19:23.426
into the dip,
stay over the left leg.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.761
Look at me, darling.
Much better that way.

19:25.796 --> 19:27.563
<i>Here, let's go into</i>
<i>the next section.</i>

19:27.597 --> 19:30.165
<i>Please pay attention.</i>
<i>Left foot coming down the hill.</i>

19:30.200 --> 19:32.167
<i>It goes five, six, seven.</i>

19:32.201 --> 19:35.403
<i>♪ Not so good in a crowd,</i>
<i>but when you get him alone... ♪</i>

19:35.438 --> 19:36.872
<i>Round two, and...</i>

19:36.906 --> 19:39.674
- Pardon me.

19:39.708 --> 19:42.010
But would you mind waking me
up if something happens?

19:42.044 --> 19:45.246
Isn't it supposed
to be a comedy?

19:45.280 --> 19:47.748
♪ But then when
he takes you home ♪

19:47.782 --> 19:50.250
♪ You'd be surprised... ♪

19:50.285 --> 19:52.353
Well, I thought
I'd put something in.

19:52.387 --> 19:54.622
What are you going
to tell Shubert?

19:54.656 --> 19:56.590
That I've seen worse.

19:56.658 --> 19:58.659
Although that usually
involves a funeral.

19:58.693 --> 20:00.660
- What about Billie?
- <i>It's not her fault.</i>

20:00.695 --> 20:02.829
She puts it over in spades.

20:02.863 --> 20:05.832
But when they decided to call
it "The Naughty Virgin,"

20:05.866 --> 20:08.468
I don't think they had
the male lead in mind.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.941
What about the other one?

20:16.377 --> 20:19.546
<i>Vern?</i>
<i>I've worked with him.</i>

20:22.016 --> 20:23.550
Did he put his hands
on your waist?

20:23.584 --> 20:25.652
I'll never tell.

20:25.686 --> 20:27.854
<i>Very nice.</i>
<i>Please stay by the piano.</i>

20:27.888 --> 20:30.323
Do you think there's
something going on there?

20:30.357 --> 20:32.859
What do you mean?

20:32.893 --> 20:34.794
Look at her.

20:34.828 --> 20:36.796
That's a frisky little pony.

20:37.965 --> 20:39.799
<i>But the other one...</i>

20:39.833 --> 20:42.067
what do they call a horse
when they cut off his kishkes?

20:42.102 --> 20:45.070
A gelding.

20:45.104 --> 20:46.872
And there's nothing
naughty about that.

20:46.906 --> 20:49.674
<i>♪ He's got the face</i>
<i>of an angel ♪</i>

20:49.709 --> 20:53.144
<i>♪ But there's a devil</i>
<i>in his eye... ♪</i>

21:03.421 --> 21:05.522
Both are now napping.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.959
When they're down for the
night you say sleeping, dear.

21:08.993 --> 21:11.428
Napping means
just a short while.

21:13.565 --> 21:16.634
"I am sleeping.
They are napping."

21:16.668 --> 21:19.137
How are you?

21:19.172 --> 21:21.373
I am hunky-dory.

21:21.407 --> 21:23.375
I enjoyed a motion pic"...

21:37.757 --> 21:39.859
Hey, shh.

21:42.462 --> 21:44.931
Ay-yi-yi-yi.

21:44.965 --> 21:47.099
Shh.

22:22.170 --> 22:25.272
Is everything
not hunky-dory?

22:27.041 --> 22:29.109
We need to talk.

22:36.151 --> 22:40.622
I have not been completely
honest about my past.

22:40.656 --> 22:42.390
I know.

22:42.425 --> 22:43.958
You can't know, dear.

22:43.993 --> 22:46.094
Yeah, I can.

22:46.128 --> 22:49.797
Your name is not your name

22:49.832 --> 22:53.469
because the bad persons,
they've said words about you.

22:53.503 --> 22:56.271
That you have stealed

22:56.306 --> 22:58.507
and that you have lied.

22:58.541 --> 23:02.111
That you have done
terrible things.

23:02.145 --> 23:04.747
I know all this.

23:06.216 --> 23:09.752
- I...
- You did not do them.

23:11.087 --> 23:13.856
They blame you
to hide themselves.

23:13.890 --> 23:16.092
That is why we ran so far.

23:16.126 --> 23:18.928
So the bad persons

23:18.962 --> 23:21.498
do not find us.

23:25.236 --> 23:27.103
That is...

23:28.172 --> 23:31.308
exactly what I was
going to say.

23:37.982 --> 23:41.551
And now we can follow the journey
through the Fallopian tubes

23:41.585 --> 23:44.854
as the fertilized egg
moves down to the uterus

23:44.888 --> 23:48.057
where it implants, causing
the woman to become...

23:48.092 --> 23:50.126
<i>with child.</i>

23:50.160 --> 23:53.596
Tomorrow evening, we'll
discuss the signs of preg...

23:55.099 --> 23:58.535
being with child and the development
of the baby in the womb.

23:58.569 --> 24:03.307
And hopefully we'll put to rest some
of our more cherished superstitions.

24:03.341 --> 24:05.376
Thank you all for coming.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.349
I wish someone had told
me all this when I was 13.

24:11.383 --> 24:13.485
I wouldn't have thought
I was dying.

24:13.519 --> 24:15.953
I'm glad you found
the class helpful.

24:24.596 --> 24:27.398
Not quite the turnout
we'd hoped for.

24:27.433 --> 24:30.302
I've had new flyers made.
I'll distribute them tomorrow.

24:30.336 --> 24:32.771
I suppose I should have
told you this earlier,

24:32.805 --> 24:36.308
but I misjudged you,
Mrs. Thompson.

24:38.044 --> 24:41.113
I am sorry.

24:42.882 --> 24:45.184
Thank you for that.

24:49.022 --> 24:51.658
So, tomorrow evening?

24:52.893 --> 24:54.427
Tomorrow evening.

24:56.064 --> 24:58.065
Well...

24:59.301 --> 25:01.869
I'm sorry.
Class just finished.

25:01.904 --> 25:05.273
- There will be another one...
- Helen, this is Mrs. Thompson.

25:05.307 --> 25:08.543
Mrs. Thompson, this is
Helen Russell, my fiancée.

25:08.577 --> 25:11.613
- Oh. - Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

25:11.647 --> 25:13.949
Lovely to meet you, too.

25:17.019 --> 25:18.854
Good night, now.

25:27.563 --> 25:29.129
You're nervous.

25:32.133 --> 25:33.667
What makes you say that?

25:33.701 --> 25:35.135
You rub the top
of your middle finger

25:35.169 --> 25:37.336
with the tip of your thumb.

25:40.107 --> 25:42.041
I don't like that
it's out of our hands.

25:42.075 --> 25:44.043
If it goes the wrong way,

25:44.077 --> 25:45.711
then someone else is to blame.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.480
- As you wish.

25:53.053 --> 25:54.954
That was me knocking.

25:54.988 --> 25:57.123
Thank you for informing me.

25:57.157 --> 25:59.725
Miss Kent.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.961
I'm interrupting.

26:01.996 --> 26:04.030
I'd say I am.

26:04.064 --> 26:06.299
- Stay by your phone.
- Aye.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.268
Miss Kent.

26:08.302 --> 26:10.036
I look forward to seeing
you on stage.

26:10.071 --> 26:12.272
Don't get your hopes up.

26:12.306 --> 26:14.874
I mean, thank you.

26:16.977 --> 26:20.080
- Rehearsal's done already?
- You could say that.

26:20.115 --> 26:22.783
I could say a lot of things.

26:33.261 --> 26:35.595
Shubert's closing us here.

26:35.630 --> 26:37.330
End of the week.

26:37.365 --> 26:40.633
Three more previews
and back to our garrets.

26:44.071 --> 26:46.105
It's not your fault.

26:46.139 --> 26:49.041
Everyone keeps saying that.

26:49.075 --> 26:51.810
It's making me worried.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.212
That ox they cast you with.

26:54.247 --> 26:55.447
He never hurt anyone.

26:55.481 --> 26:57.149
Why doesn't Shubert
find another actor?

26:57.183 --> 26:59.784
Who'd you have in mind?

27:01.086 --> 27:03.054
The choreographer.

27:03.088 --> 27:05.556
He looks like
he knows what he's doing.

27:05.590 --> 27:07.291
Vern?

27:07.325 --> 27:10.127
He's nobody's idea of a star.

27:11.663 --> 27:13.831
Let's face it, neither am I.

27:24.209 --> 27:25.976
Why don't I talk to Lee?

27:28.146 --> 27:29.780
Don't.

27:29.814 --> 27:33.284
New actor, new script,
new songs.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.152
It happens, doesn't it?

27:35.186 --> 27:37.321
- Gus.
- I'll call him right now.

27:37.355 --> 27:40.791
I just wanted to complain.
That's all.

27:42.027 --> 27:46.464
Well, let's go drop
a boatload at dinner.

27:46.498 --> 27:50.134
If it's all right with you,
I'd rather just close my eyes.

27:52.437 --> 27:54.471
Sure.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.510
Know what I hate the most?

27:59.544 --> 28:02.280
I keep hearing
my father's voice.

28:04.216 --> 28:06.984
"Always on the move,
but going nowhere fast."

28:20.164 --> 28:22.832
- Hey, let me have one of those.
- Yeah, sure.

28:24.001 --> 28:25.869
I'd get lost
in all these fields here.

28:25.903 --> 28:28.338
It wasn't the money,
believe me.

28:28.372 --> 28:30.974
Though I'd be lying
if I said it didn't sting.

28:31.008 --> 28:33.310
It was his attitude mostly.

28:33.344 --> 28:34.711
The arrogance.

28:34.745 --> 28:37.147
Hubris the Greeks call it.

28:37.181 --> 28:38.615
Well, look what
happened to them.

28:38.649 --> 28:41.651
Conquered by Italians.
Just like Nucky.

28:41.686 --> 28:44.554
At New Year's, Nucky's party,

28:44.589 --> 28:47.390
I said some things
I shouldn't have.

28:47.424 --> 28:50.226
I have thick skin,
Mr. Rosetti.

28:50.260 --> 28:53.462
Quite pale, as you
can see, but very thick.

28:53.497 --> 28:55.965
- Sticks and stones, huh?
- I'm glad you see it that way.

28:55.999 --> 28:57.366
Couldn't do business otherwise.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.635
Which brings us here tonight.

28:59.669 --> 29:01.469
In light of
recent developments,

29:01.504 --> 29:04.172
it appears
I'm short a supplier.

29:04.206 --> 29:06.007
Well, you are in luck.

29:06.041 --> 29:07.942
Tabor Heights,
or as I like to call it,

29:07.976 --> 29:10.278
my little slice of paradise,

29:10.312 --> 29:12.380
happens to be located
on the same ocean

29:12.414 --> 29:14.249
that Nucky Thompson
used to control.

29:14.283 --> 29:16.951
Now I'll have the same
boats, same booze.

29:16.986 --> 29:19.621
Hell, I'll even give
you the same price.

29:19.655 --> 29:22.123
We're even 60 miles
closer to New York.

29:22.158 --> 29:24.626
I only want
the genuine article.

29:24.660 --> 29:27.596
I have no use
for anything less.

29:29.532 --> 29:31.900
- Is that today's?
- Yeah, evening edition.

29:31.934 --> 29:34.035
Give me one.

29:40.510 --> 29:42.443
Thanks, mister.

29:43.579 --> 29:46.114
Hey.

29:46.148 --> 29:47.949
I thought you said
this was today's.

29:47.983 --> 29:50.584
All this stuff
happened yesterday.

29:51.553 --> 29:54.755
Well, sure.
That's...

30:04.566 --> 30:06.267
I had you there for a second.

30:06.301 --> 30:09.570
From now on, room 207
at the Kinneret Lodge.

30:09.605 --> 30:12.807
- Add me to your route.
- You betcha.

30:16.845 --> 30:19.479
Tomorrow, just after midnight,

30:19.513 --> 30:22.382
600 cases of whiskey coming in.

30:22.416 --> 30:26.786
Come around if you want,
sample it for yourselves.

30:30.724 --> 30:32.859
- Salud.
- Salud.

30:44.606 --> 30:46.808
That's it, I surrender.

30:46.842 --> 30:49.044
Keep feeding me like that,
I'll lose my girlish figure.

30:49.078 --> 30:51.379
Tapeworms, that's my secret.

31:00.690 --> 31:02.190
For you.

31:03.126 --> 31:05.293
Passover vodka?

31:05.328 --> 31:07.695
Very thoughtful, Nucky.

31:07.730 --> 31:10.231
Think He'll mind if
a Catholic takes a shot?

31:10.266 --> 31:11.899
L'chaim.

31:13.068 --> 31:15.337
- What does that mean again?
- To life.

31:15.371 --> 31:18.506
In fact, I've got an uncle doing
10 years l'chaim up in Sing Sing.

31:32.522 --> 31:34.156
Whoo!

31:34.190 --> 31:36.258
That'd get you through
40 years in the desert.

31:38.495 --> 31:39.862
You know what that show needs?

31:39.896 --> 31:42.164
Some dub prancing around
like a schvartze?

31:42.198 --> 31:45.668
Oh, no, sir!
Oh!

31:45.702 --> 31:47.536
It needs a star.

31:47.571 --> 31:49.571
It needs you.

31:49.606 --> 31:52.308
I don't disagree.

31:55.979 --> 31:58.981
- Then you'll do it.
- Come again?

31:59.015 --> 32:00.217
You're going to star in
"The Naughty Virgin".

32:00.318 --> 32:01.684
Congratulations.

32:01.785 --> 32:04.186
Oh, I can't.
I have a commitment.

32:04.221 --> 32:06.889
Kern's new show in New York.
I start rehearsals next week.

32:06.923 --> 32:09.358
- Well, postpone it.
- Contracts are signed.

32:09.392 --> 32:11.794
The theater's booked.
Besides, it's a great show.

32:11.828 --> 32:13.896
I'll make it worth your while
if that's your concern.

32:13.930 --> 32:15.665
It's not about money.
I've given my word.

32:15.699 --> 32:17.967
That's easy to straighten out.

32:18.001 --> 32:19.302
Nuck, please.

32:19.336 --> 32:22.238
<i>I'd rather</i>
<i>you didn't do that.</i>

32:29.013 --> 32:32.481
Well, you can't blame
me for trying.

32:33.717 --> 32:36.085
Heck, Billie's gonna
come out fine.

32:36.119 --> 32:39.321
You'll see.
I mean, it's not like she wrote it.

32:39.355 --> 32:42.657
- Tough game, isn't it?
- Show business?

32:42.692 --> 32:46.061
You know what they say,
dying is easy.

32:47.997 --> 32:51.166
Good luck with the new one.
I'll be fifth row center.

32:53.302 --> 32:55.537
I knew you'd understand.

32:55.572 --> 32:57.673
And thanks for lunch.

33:00.010 --> 33:02.812
Eddie.

33:02.880 --> 33:05.015
Forgot your vodka.

33:10.221 --> 33:11.855
L'chaim.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.308
They pray to that fat fuck?

33:31.342 --> 33:33.577
It's a symbol of enlightenment.

33:38.015 --> 33:41.485
New shipment of heroin.
That ought to make Rothstein happy.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.620
It's the other one
I'm worried about.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.891
What, Masseria?
Fuck him.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.361
Let me see.

33:59.404 --> 34:00.704
Last two numbers
are still visible.

34:00.738 --> 34:02.506
My hand hurts.

34:02.540 --> 34:06.710
Once they're filed off, lightly
stipple the area with a punch.

34:06.744 --> 34:09.212
Lightly. You don't want
to damage the frame.

34:09.246 --> 34:11.781
A lot of fuss for nothing.

34:11.815 --> 34:14.618
- You're an expert now?
- I've done it plenty of times.

34:16.353 --> 34:18.389
Well, then one more
shouldn't be a problem.

34:23.362 --> 34:26.630
Women's health clinic.
St. Theresa's.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.900
- Women's health clinic.
- It's the Dawson's Dancing Dolls.

34:28.935 --> 34:31.436
Women's health clinic.
St. Theresa's Hospital.

34:31.471 --> 34:33.839
- Free to all. - You've never
seen anything like 'em, sir.

34:33.873 --> 34:36.842
8:30 this evening at
The Funny Place. - How are you?

34:36.876 --> 34:40.112
Women's health clinic. St.
Theresa's Hospital. Free to all.

34:40.147 --> 34:41.813
You've never seen
anything like 'em.

34:41.848 --> 34:44.650
Women's health clinic.
St. Theresa's Hospital.

34:44.684 --> 34:47.152
<i>8:30 this evening</i>
<i>at The Funny Place.</i>

34:47.152 --> 34:47.985
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

34:48.087 --> 34:51.489
<i>Bring some friends.</i>
<i>Dawson's Dancing Dolls.</i>

34:51.523 --> 34:53.690
They're dimpled,
they're darling.

34:53.726 --> 34:55.193
Oh, they are delightful.

34:56.395 --> 34:58.663
Excuse me.

35:01.834 --> 35:03.168
Marguerite.

35:03.203 --> 35:05.871
<i>An unexpected pleasure.</i>

35:05.906 --> 35:07.506
How are you, Madame Jeunet?

35:07.541 --> 35:10.642
I am well. Very well, yes.
But we are closed.

35:10.677 --> 35:13.411
- <i>Hélas.</i>
- I'm sorry?

35:13.446 --> 35:14.813
The spring dresses
are arriving.

35:14.847 --> 35:17.682
Beautiful they will be.
<i>Comme dans un rêve.</i>

35:17.716 --> 35:19.817
You must see them,
but tomorrow.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.752
I've no doubt they're lovely.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.054
But actually,
I'm here to ask a favor.

35:24.088 --> 35:25.689
It is granted, whatever it is.

35:25.723 --> 35:27.490
But when you come back, yes?

35:27.525 --> 35:30.093
If I could just leave
some of these here

35:30.128 --> 35:32.462
for any customer
that might be interested.

35:32.497 --> 35:34.364
<i>C'est primordial.</i>
I take them.

35:34.398 --> 35:35.866
Come back when all is ready.

35:35.900 --> 35:39.270
I think she'd
prefer something...

35:45.477 --> 35:46.911
Good afternoon.

35:46.946 --> 35:49.380
Yes. I...

35:49.415 --> 35:51.816
Your plans
have changed, clearly.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.518
- That is what happened.
- He expected to be out of town.

35:54.553 --> 35:57.054
But he was able to stay
at home after all.

35:57.088 --> 35:59.022
Look, Margaret, I...

36:00.892 --> 36:03.593
Well? I'm looking.

36:03.627 --> 36:07.930
<i>Gus, it's all</i>
<i>too fancy for me.</i>

36:07.964 --> 36:09.832
Why don't we just...

36:11.735 --> 36:13.636
Gosh.

36:16.573 --> 36:18.273
- This is...
- Miss Kent.

36:18.308 --> 36:20.909
Your friends call you Billie.

36:20.944 --> 36:23.446
Guess that won't
be happening here.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.681
Why don't we
discuss this later?

36:26.917 --> 36:29.085
There's no need.

36:35.626 --> 36:38.995
I doubt that you're free
in the evenings, but...

37:01.753 --> 37:04.322
Well, that's service.
I haven't even called for a cab yet.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.123
- How's that?
- I travel light.

37:06.158 --> 37:08.125
Never know when you'll have
to leave town in a hurry.

37:08.160 --> 37:10.294
- Just give me 10 minutes.
- Ain't a cabbie.

37:10.329 --> 37:13.264
- Oh, you ain't, ain't you?
- No, sir.

37:17.635 --> 37:21.472
Listen, fellas, I...are you sure
you've got the right room?

37:21.506 --> 37:23.474
You Eddie Cantor, ain't you?

37:23.508 --> 37:25.843
Depends how big the bill is.

37:25.877 --> 37:28.679
We're affiliated
with Mr. Thompson.

37:32.484 --> 37:35.286
You're Milky, isn't it?

37:37.089 --> 37:38.723
Chalky.

37:38.758 --> 37:41.393
See, when you come to town,

37:41.427 --> 37:43.862
we never do get a chance
to see you strut.

37:43.897 --> 37:46.031
On account of the rules
of the venue.

37:46.066 --> 37:48.901
Oh, boys, let me tell you,
that's an outrage.

37:48.936 --> 37:51.637
You come to New York, I personally
guarantee you the best box.

37:51.672 --> 37:53.406
Ain't gonna be able to do that.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.442
But Mr. Thompson,
he say come by.

37:56.477 --> 37:58.477
Maybe you do
a little show for us.

37:58.512 --> 38:00.112
Well, I wish I had the time.

38:00.147 --> 38:02.248
Said you had 10 minutes.

38:04.585 --> 38:06.352
Look, um...

38:06.387 --> 38:07.921
Mr. White.

38:07.955 --> 38:10.390
And Mr. Purnsley.

38:10.425 --> 38:14.361
I explained to Nucky.
He means the world to me.

38:14.395 --> 38:16.429
I just can't walk away
from a contract.

38:16.464 --> 38:18.331
He, of all people,
understands...

38:18.365 --> 38:21.234
Any particular place
you like us to sit?

38:24.071 --> 38:26.839
Right there is good.

38:36.349 --> 38:38.316
Usually work a bigger room.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.818
We simple folk.

38:44.556 --> 38:47.024
Make it something funny.

40:10.378 --> 40:12.078
You said 5:30.

40:12.113 --> 40:16.750
I took the roundabout way
to elude the baying hounds.

40:16.784 --> 40:19.186
What hounds?
Were you followed?

40:19.220 --> 40:21.521
A verbal flourish,
Mr. Smith.

40:21.589 --> 40:23.490
What happened over there?
There's nothing in the paper.

40:23.524 --> 40:25.392
Well, it was a closed hearing,

40:25.426 --> 40:27.227
but not without
its points of interest.

40:27.261 --> 40:30.263
There was an admiral
of the Coast Guard.

40:30.297 --> 40:32.732
Rather dashing
in his dress whites.

40:32.766 --> 40:36.703
A district supervisor from
the Bureau of Prohibition

40:36.737 --> 40:40.406
with a stain of some nature
on his pants cuff.

40:40.440 --> 40:44.343
And the Secretary of the Treasury
soberly attired in dark wool.

40:44.377 --> 40:46.612
I don't care what they were wearing.
What did Mellon say?

40:46.646 --> 40:49.014
I would not call him

40:49.048 --> 40:51.316
a staunch ally of
the Justice Department.

40:51.351 --> 40:52.517
Harry can't stand him.

40:52.552 --> 40:54.820
No doubt the feeling
is reciprocated.

40:56.389 --> 40:57.690
What can he do to us?

40:57.724 --> 41:01.561
Well, a man with $200
million to his name

41:01.595 --> 41:04.530
can do whatever he chooses.

41:05.966 --> 41:09.903
Oh, you're looking
a tad peaked.

41:10.972 --> 41:12.706
Is this all a joke
to you, Means?

41:12.740 --> 41:17.277
No, but I find pleasure
where I can.

41:20.182 --> 41:23.885
Why am I doing this?
Why did I leave Ohio?

41:23.919 --> 41:26.254
For the profit, Jess.
For the profit.

41:26.288 --> 41:28.023
I can't keep
track of the money.

41:28.057 --> 41:30.192
I don't remember who I lied
to or what lies I told them.

41:30.226 --> 41:32.027
And now with this damn
senator rooting around,

41:32.061 --> 41:34.363
what if he finds
someone honest?

41:34.397 --> 41:36.565
Attorneys general
do not go to prison.

41:36.600 --> 41:40.703
I'm not the attorney general.
Harry Daugherty is.

41:40.737 --> 41:42.572
It's all quite elementary.

41:42.606 --> 41:45.508
Your adversaries claim you're
not putting bootleggers in jail.

41:45.542 --> 41:47.443
Tell Mr. Daugherty
to put one in jail.

41:47.478 --> 41:50.280
Bootleggers are the men
we're in business with.

41:50.314 --> 41:52.648
If they go to jail...

41:56.453 --> 41:58.087
What I've learned,

41:58.121 --> 42:01.891
the truth is surprisingly
easy to obfuscate.

42:08.265 --> 42:10.132
What the heck
is going on in here?

42:10.167 --> 42:11.767
Oh, thank the Lord
you manifested.

42:11.802 --> 42:15.471
I was afraid we'd be imprisoned
until the cockerel crowed.

42:26.017 --> 42:28.251
It's all right, Prudence.
You needn't bother yourself.

42:28.286 --> 42:30.320
<i>It's me.</i>

42:33.692 --> 42:35.192
May I sit?

42:36.595 --> 42:38.663
It's your house.

42:47.742 --> 42:49.276
Would you mind?

42:49.310 --> 42:52.246
Do you imagine this being
a lengthy conversation?

42:52.280 --> 42:56.116
I don't think either of us is
terribly interested in that.

43:03.858 --> 43:06.594
- This afternoon...
- Please, don't.

43:06.628 --> 43:09.430
- Just let me... - Whatever fiction
you prefer is perfectly fine with me.

43:09.464 --> 43:11.232
I'm sorry.

43:12.901 --> 43:16.137
I am sorry.

43:17.707 --> 43:20.542
For demonstrating

43:20.576 --> 43:24.046
bad form.

43:24.080 --> 43:26.915
Bad form?

43:26.950 --> 43:28.817
Yes.

43:28.852 --> 43:32.388
That would distress you,
wouldn't it?

43:33.457 --> 43:35.591
- I'm being honest.
- <i>I know.</i>

43:35.626 --> 43:37.927
That's what's making it all

43:37.962 --> 43:40.564
just slightly humiliating.

43:42.867 --> 43:46.237
Is she in need
of rescuing, too?

43:47.939 --> 43:51.842
She seems pretty capable
of looking after herself.

43:53.278 --> 43:55.979
I think that might
prove difficult for you.

43:56.014 --> 43:57.747
How's that?

43:57.782 --> 44:00.317
It's not a role
you're comfortable in.

44:01.553 --> 44:03.353
Maybe I've changed.

44:03.388 --> 44:06.089
Perhaps you're not
the only one.

44:12.263 --> 44:15.166
I'll look in on the kids,
then I'll leave.

44:15.200 --> 44:18.002
- No.
- I'm sorry?

44:18.036 --> 44:20.504
I'd rather you didn't look in.

44:20.539 --> 44:22.106
I'm still their stepfather.

44:22.141 --> 44:24.709
That's one of
the things you are.

44:26.378 --> 44:28.512
Fair enough.

44:28.547 --> 44:31.082
But you might
want to ask yourself

44:31.116 --> 44:32.950
some practical questions.

44:49.768 --> 44:51.535
<i>When do you expect him?</i>

44:51.569 --> 44:54.972
<i>I'm sure he will be home.</i>

44:55.006 --> 44:57.207
<i>What time does he</i>
<i>usually get home?</i>

44:57.242 --> 44:59.376
<i>It is this time.</i>

44:59.411 --> 45:01.512
<i>It is time now.</i>

45:01.546 --> 45:04.514
<i>Is he always this late?</i>

45:11.255 --> 45:13.724
You're a hard man
to track down.

45:13.758 --> 45:16.627
Agent Coughlin.

45:17.729 --> 45:18.862
What do you want?

45:18.896 --> 45:21.598
I check on the dinner.

45:28.673 --> 45:31.574
Do you

45:31.609 --> 45:35.411
intend to extort money from me?

45:35.446 --> 45:38.514
I'd say it was
the other way around.

45:38.549 --> 45:40.950
- <i>Wouldn't you?</i>
- What?

45:40.985 --> 45:43.486
I saw you that night
at the speak.

45:43.520 --> 45:46.455
I kept thinking,
"How do I know this fella?"

45:46.490 --> 45:49.191
<i>I mean, that's a face</i>
<i>you can't forget.</i>

45:49.226 --> 45:51.060
<i>Then it hit me.</i>

45:51.094 --> 45:54.229
You came to my house
before Christmas.

45:54.264 --> 45:56.264
Over on 27th.

45:56.299 --> 45:58.333
Gave me the big sales pitch.

45:58.367 --> 46:02.003
How I could save money if I
pressed my shirts myself.

46:02.037 --> 46:06.741
<i>Well, that iron you sold me</i>
<i>is a piece of junk.</i>

46:06.776 --> 46:09.144
Used it two or three times.

46:09.178 --> 46:12.213
Then it totally fell apart.

46:12.248 --> 46:14.016
- No!

46:21.824 --> 46:24.492
He wasn't here to arrest me.

46:24.527 --> 46:27.329
I sold him an iron.

46:39.943 --> 46:42.411
I hold his legs.

46:49.785 --> 46:51.920
<i>Husband!</i>

47:01.931 --> 47:04.499
Please avert your eyes.

48:03.894 --> 48:06.629
The bad person.

48:33.688 --> 48:35.690
It's quiet this evening.

48:35.724 --> 48:38.092
So I see.

48:41.931 --> 48:45.234
Get out on the porch
and attract some customers.

48:45.268 --> 48:47.670
I thought you didn't
want us doing that.

48:47.704 --> 48:51.073
Then why the goddamn hell
would I say it?

48:56.747 --> 48:59.415
<i>My dearest James.</i>

48:59.449 --> 49:01.984
<i>I am compelled</i>
<i>to write to you</i>

49:02.018 --> 49:05.588
<i>due to my constant</i>
<i>concern over expenses</i>

49:05.622 --> 49:08.824
<i>which are more</i>
<i>than I can bear alone.</i>

49:13.496 --> 49:16.798
<i>I miss you terribly</i>
<i>every day.</i>

49:16.832 --> 49:19.133
<i>Life is nothing</i>
<i>without you</i>

49:19.167 --> 49:23.604
<i>and there is no one</i>
<i>who understands me.</i>

49:23.638 --> 49:27.240
<i>Please, please,</i>

49:27.274 --> 49:29.809
<i>please come home.</i>

49:32.880 --> 49:35.815
<i>Your eternally</i>
<i>devoted mother.</i>

49:56.706 --> 49:58.841
You've lost one,
Mrs. Thompson.

49:58.875 --> 50:00.976
Excuse me?

50:01.010 --> 50:02.945
There were five last night.

50:06.483 --> 50:08.551
We'll wait a few more minutes.

50:08.586 --> 50:10.553
That seems rather ad hoc.

50:10.588 --> 50:13.622
Not everyone has
your rigor, Sister.

50:13.657 --> 50:16.091
One tends to be prompt

50:16.126 --> 50:18.427
for the things one
considers important.

50:18.461 --> 50:19.861
Begging your pardon, ma'am.

50:19.896 --> 50:22.263
But it is hard to
get away in the evening.

50:22.298 --> 50:24.065
What would you find
more convenient?

50:24.099 --> 50:27.735
For me, the morning after
I've cleared away breakfast.

50:27.769 --> 50:31.471
And before the children
are home from school.

50:32.674 --> 50:34.842
Perhaps we can better
accommodate them.

50:34.876 --> 50:38.011
Sadly, those hours would
not suit my schedule.

50:39.881 --> 50:42.449
- Mrs. Thompson?

50:48.356 --> 50:50.757
Dr. Mason has an emergency
on the ward.

50:50.792 --> 50:53.760
When will he be free?

50:53.795 --> 50:56.630
There's no saying right now.
He's very sorry.

50:56.664 --> 50:58.966
Tell him not to concern himself

50:59.000 --> 51:01.568
and we'll speak when he's free.

51:12.914 --> 51:16.517
Ladies, let's begin.

51:16.551 --> 51:19.487
Isn't the doctor coming?

51:19.521 --> 51:22.823
He's called away,
unfortunately.

51:22.858 --> 51:24.525
But we can still have a class.

51:24.559 --> 51:26.427
What would be
the point of that?

51:26.462 --> 51:29.563
We have our book.
We have our chart.

51:29.598 --> 51:32.666
We have ourselves.
What else is needed?

51:32.701 --> 51:35.002
This is not what we've
agreed to, Mrs. Thompson.

51:35.036 --> 51:39.273
Yes, the whole day's
been rather like that.

51:39.307 --> 51:43.543
Last time we talked about
conception... how life begins.

51:43.577 --> 51:46.779
This evening we're going
to discuss development.

51:46.813 --> 51:49.748
How a human being grows.

52:07.969 --> 52:11.539
<i>Well, well,</i>
<i>it's the iron man.</i>

52:11.573 --> 52:15.510
Hey, this must be
a pressing issue.

52:16.912 --> 52:19.314
May I come in?

52:29.326 --> 52:30.994
I need your help.

52:31.028 --> 52:33.263
Flowers?

52:42.373 --> 52:45.309
I must dispose of a body.

52:49.080 --> 52:51.214
Oh.

52:52.984 --> 52:55.185
Must you, now?

53:07.165 --> 53:08.932
Where's the other kid?

53:08.967 --> 53:10.901
Caught a fever.

53:28.389 --> 53:30.923
- For Mr. Rosetti.
- I'll take it.

53:30.958 --> 53:32.525
Suit yourself.

53:32.560 --> 53:34.928
- Untie me.

53:34.962 --> 53:37.931
- Untie me!
- I'm trying.

53:39.133 --> 53:40.934
What's happening?

53:40.968 --> 53:43.069
<i>What's going on?</i>

53:45.506 --> 53:47.875
<i>Mr. Rosetti!</i>

54:06.460 --> 54:08.295
Don't shoot!

54:10.798 --> 54:13.634
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

54:15.704 --> 54:17.772
Go, go, go, go!

54:41.529 --> 54:43.630
Aw, fuck.

55:06.553 --> 55:09.889
<i>Oh, I think you're brilliant.</i>
<i>You are absolutely brilliant!</i>

55:09.923 --> 55:11.490
Let's go, Vern.

55:13.694 --> 55:15.428
We'll keep it the same for now.

55:15.462 --> 55:17.697
He'll have his own ideas,

55:17.731 --> 55:19.933
but we'll deal with that
as we stumble through, okay?

55:19.967 --> 55:23.136
- Vern.
- Don't say it.

55:23.170 --> 55:25.704
But this is crazy, isn't it?

55:25.739 --> 55:29.576
Kid, the whole
business is crazy.

55:29.610 --> 55:31.511
I'll see you up there.

55:35.383 --> 55:37.951
He's got a very cute boyfriend.

55:40.522 --> 55:42.957
He doesn't come off that way.

55:44.259 --> 55:46.127
Want to tell me what happened?

55:46.161 --> 55:49.364
You don't have to worry about it.
I had a discussion with her,

55:49.398 --> 55:52.533
we reached an understanding,
and it won't happen again.

55:53.702 --> 55:55.736
That's not what I meant.

55:55.771 --> 55:57.838
Then I guess you'd
better clue me in.

55:57.873 --> 56:00.007
Yesterday we were closing.

56:00.041 --> 56:02.175
Today they're
rewriting the show.

56:02.209 --> 56:05.845
Sounds like Shubert's
protecting his investment.

56:07.581 --> 56:09.648
What did you do, Gus?

56:09.682 --> 56:12.685
I didn't do anything.
You told me not to.

56:12.719 --> 56:16.922
Besides, what does it matter as
long as you get what you want?

56:16.956 --> 56:19.491
Your father doesn't know
what he's talking about.

56:21.261 --> 56:23.562
Billie.
We're gonna run through it.

56:32.205 --> 56:34.740
What did I say?
What did I do?

56:34.775 --> 56:37.042
What did I do?
I like her.

56:42.516 --> 56:46.284
Eddie, you're a lifesaver.

56:47.386 --> 56:49.321
Whatever you're doing here,

56:49.355 --> 56:51.690
I promise I won't let you down.

56:51.758 --> 56:54.025
Lucy Danziger.

56:54.060 --> 56:56.928
Ever heard of her?

56:59.465 --> 57:02.701
The next one won't know a
goddamn thing about you either.

57:02.735 --> 57:05.638
<i>All right, kids, just</i>
<i>muddle through and make it work.</i>
