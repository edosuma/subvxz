03:07.888 --> 03:10.255
- You're gonna
burn him. Be careful.
- Shut up.

03:11.591 --> 03:13.292
Oh, my God...

03:14.527 --> 03:17.396
- <i>- Holy...</i>

03:33.680 --> 03:36.215
You girls are cruel.

03:38.586 --> 03:41.887
<i>Guys, quit. You're going...
seriously, just stop.</i>

03:41.889 --> 03:43.589
- <i> You're going to burn...</i>

03:43.591 --> 03:45.290
<i>What was that?!</i>
- Oh!

03:45.292 --> 03:47.226
- Matt, stop.
- Wha...

03:47.228 --> 03:49.595
- Matt, stop the car.
You hit something.
- What?

03:49.597 --> 03:52.331
Wait, let me
get my camera.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.732
<i>Something's burning.
The engine's burning.</i>

03:53.734 --> 03:54.933
Fucked up
the front end.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.702
Everyone, chill.
Everyone, chill.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.864
You gonna give the deer
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation?

04:02.275 --> 04:03.642
Hit a fucking deer
or something.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.644
I mean, you good, man.
The car's still running.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.913
- I'm good?!
- There's nothing leaking...

04:07.915 --> 04:09.681
- 700 bucks!
- Look, there's nothing
leaking at the bottom, bro.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.617
You're straight.
It sounded fine.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.859
- We can get there. Let's go.
- I know, but it's just...

04:19.425 --> 04:20.926
That wasn't no deer, bro.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.016
<i>It's here.</i>

04:56.463 --> 04:58.964
<i>- Fuck, what is that?
- Over there.</i>

04:58.966 --> 05:00.899
Look at the leaves.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.642
<i>Holy shit.</i>

05:10.644 --> 05:12.604
<i>Guys, something's moving
out there.</i>

05:18.051 --> 05:20.986
- - Let's go!

05:20.988 --> 05:24.323
Jesus.
- Okay, okay.
We're coming. Chill.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.525
<i>Matt, maybe we</i>
should just go home.

05:26.527 --> 05:29.027
<i>Babe, I've driven,
like, eight hours.</i>

05:29.029 --> 05:30.896
- <i> I'm not just</i>
going to turn around.
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

05:30.898 --> 05:32.698
Really? Really?
My beard?

05:32.700 --> 05:34.599
- Shut up, Brian.
- You shut up.

05:34.601 --> 05:35.901
You burnt
my fucking beard.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.869
Yo, did anybody see
what that was?

05:37.871 --> 05:40.505
<i>- Maybe it was a bear.
- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

05:40.507 --> 05:42.774
- <i> I got something.</i>
<i>I don't know</i>
if it was a fucking bear.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.936
<i>It's probably</i>
a deer or something.
<i>What is that?</i>

05:46.512 --> 05:47.912
Yo, what the fuck
is that?

05:51.084 --> 05:53.018
<i>It looks like it's walking.</i>

05:53.020 --> 05:56.021
- - Fucking shit!

05:56.023 --> 05:57.622
<i>I think</i>
I missed the road.
<i>What the hell?</i>

05:57.624 --> 06:01.059
<i>There we go. This is it.</i>

06:01.061 --> 06:03.962
<i>Riverfront.</i>

06:03.964 --> 06:06.031
<i>Oh, that shit is overgrown.</i>

06:06.033 --> 06:08.633
- Is this for real it?
- Oh, my God.

06:08.635 --> 06:11.436
<i>Trust me, it's better
on the other side, guys.</i>

06:22.048 --> 06:24.049
Dude, I don't remember it
being this...

06:24.051 --> 06:27.152
- Do you remember
where we stop?
- No.

06:37.096 --> 06:39.164
Bro, your uncle
has a cabin out here?

06:39.166 --> 06:40.632
- Yeah, dude.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.846
<i>- Um...
- What the fuck, bro?</i>

06:54.848 --> 06:57.416
<i>We're not getting past that.</i>

06:57.418 --> 07:00.786
<i>- It's seriously just up here.
- We've got to walk from here.</i>

07:00.788 --> 07:02.888
What do you mean
you can't...

07:02.890 --> 07:05.770
- What? Where do you
want to go around?
- I don't know!

07:07.628 --> 07:09.428
What are you
getting out for?

07:09.430 --> 07:11.663
She's right.
We have to walk
from here.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.665
- Are you serious?
- I'm not walking.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.102
<i>Black people
don't do this shit, man.</i>

07:17.104 --> 07:19.938
All right, guys.
It's just up here
to the right.

07:23.976 --> 07:26.545
- - Yo.

07:28.047 --> 07:30.449
Anybody hear that?

07:30.451 --> 07:32.918
Hear what?

07:34.654 --> 07:36.655
<i>I heard something, man.</i>

07:42.161 --> 07:45.063
<i>There it is.</i>

07:45.065 --> 07:47.566
<i>Is that it?
- Yeah.</i>

07:47.568 --> 07:49.701
<i>Home, sweet home.</i>

07:49.703 --> 07:51.470
Seriously?

07:51.472 --> 07:54.005
Trust me, guys.
It looks a lot better
in the daylight.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.741
<i>- Oh, shit. Jesus.
- Watch out on the right.</i>

07:56.743 --> 07:58.577
<i>There's a loose board.</i>

08:01.013 --> 08:03.882
<i>Uh, whoa.</i>

08:03.884 --> 08:06.651
-<i> Guess we didn't need</i>
to steal the keys, huh?
- Shut up.

08:13.025 --> 08:14.593
Man.

08:23.903 --> 08:27.706
Um, I mean, yeah,
we just need to brush off
some of these leaves and stuff,

08:27.708 --> 08:29.641
but, yeah, this is it.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.643
Ew!

08:31.645 --> 08:34.913
When's the last time
he was here?

08:34.914 --> 08:37.282
Kind of looks like
somebody left in a hurry.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.150
<i>It's like a lovemaking
palace up in here.</i>

08:39.152 --> 08:41.186
<i>Sweat stains on it.</i>

08:41.188 --> 08:43.922
<i>Usually they got rose petals
and shit on the ground,</i>

08:43.924 --> 08:45.924
<i>but we got leaves.</i>

08:45.926 --> 08:49.294
<i>We got leaves.</i>
<i>You can make tons of magic</i>
<i>up in here.</i>

08:49.296 --> 08:52.163
I mean, you just hop on,
you know?

08:52.165 --> 08:55.033
Oh, baby!

08:55.035 --> 08:56.701
<i>All right, Brian.</i>
- Yeah!

08:56.703 --> 08:58.603
<i>- So lame.
- Brian, quit it.</i>

08:58.605 --> 09:00.939
<i>You're making it
all fucking dusty.</i>

09:00.941 --> 09:03.141
- Fucking job!

09:03.143 --> 09:06.044
<i>- </i> What the hell was that?
<i>- What was that?</i>

09:06.046 --> 09:08.046
Hello?

09:10.216 --> 09:12.083
Hello?

09:12.085 --> 09:15.053
Matt, hold on.
Matt. Wait up.

09:17.690 --> 09:20.191
- - Don't go over there.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.672
Seriously, there's
a fucking pig in your cabin?

09:33.674 --> 09:36.041
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
<i>- Oh, hell, no, man.</i>

09:36.043 --> 09:38.176
<i>We'll get it</i>
out and we'll just...
- I'm not touching it!

09:38.178 --> 09:40.579
It's your cabin.
And I'm not staying
in this motherfucker.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.180
It's a fucking hog.
We're out in the woods.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.583
- I'm not staying here.
- Me neither.

09:44.585 --> 09:45.951
Come on, babe.
Fuck that.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.192
<i>Matt.</i>

10:27.194 --> 10:29.094
What?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.334
<i>What is that?</i>

10:54.654 --> 10:56.421
<i>You see anything?</i>

11:00.726 --> 11:03.094
<i>No.</i>

11:03.096 --> 11:05.130
<i>Just go to sleep.</i>

11:12.772 --> 11:14.906
<i>It sounds like it's crying.</i>

11:16.108 --> 11:17.976
<i>Close the window, dude.</i>

11:17.978 --> 11:20.712
- <i> Do you hear that?</i>
- Close the window.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.081
<i>Dude, you don't hear...
come on.</i>

11:23.083 --> 11:25.183
- <i>- Oh, you're a dick.</i>

11:36.195 --> 11:39.097
<i>Dude, do you think</i>
<i>it was that shit that Uncle Bob</i>
<i>saw back in the day?</i>

11:39.099 --> 11:41.032
Shut up about that.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.734
<i>Why?</i>

11:45.438 --> 11:49.007
Not a word about
any of that stupid shit.
I'm serious.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.078
I'm serious.

12:03.422 --> 12:05.423
<i>Maybe it's that thing we hit.</i>

12:39.325 --> 12:41.059
Oh, my God.

12:42.261 --> 12:44.395
What do we got here?

12:49.269 --> 12:52.303
- - So this is pretty sweet.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.173
Usually when you put a GoPro
camera inside of this casing,

12:55.175 --> 12:58.176
it doesn't focus very well
underwater.

12:58.178 --> 13:01.479
So I went out and I bought
one of these bad boys.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.349
That's going to help me
focus underwater because
it's got a flat lens.

13:04.351 --> 13:07.218
So we're pretty much
going to get some pimp shots
underwater today.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.554
What's going on? Hey.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.123
- Brian.
- What's up?

13:12.125 --> 13:15.460
- Come swimming with us.
- Oh, I'll be right there.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.196
<i>Mm. What's up?
How you doing?</i>

13:18.198 --> 13:20.932
- What is this?
- It's called a little
GoPro camera.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.034
- You're an obsessed freak.
- What's going to happen is

13:23.036 --> 13:24.903
I'm going to make you guys
look like super pimps

13:24.905 --> 13:26.437
because we're going to have
the best YouTube video ever.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.473
- You're lame. Let's go.
- Hold up, hold up.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.142
- I got to get
this shit together.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.081
Die, motherfuckers!

13:41.220 --> 13:43.488
<i>Good shit!
That's great shit!</i>

13:43.490 --> 13:46.891
- <i> Shit, dude, nice!</i>

13:46.893 --> 13:49.327
- <i> What you got? What you got?</i>
- Want to see what I got?

13:49.329 --> 13:51.496
-<i> I'd love to see what you got.</i>
- I'm going to show y'all
what I got.

13:51.498 --> 13:55.233
- Hold up, this is how
I'm about to do it.
- Make me proud.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.402
<i>YouTube ain't got
shit on us, man!</i>

13:57.404 --> 14:00.004
Oh! Damn!

14:00.006 --> 14:03.408
I don't know.
Todd may have just
shown up Matt for sure.

14:33.272 --> 14:34.439
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

14:41.280 --> 14:43.314
<i>What've we got here?</i>

14:48.287 --> 14:51.556
<i>Looks like a little
love walk going on.</i>

15:04.970 --> 15:06.970
<i>God, I am so
going to hell for this.</i>

15:09.308 --> 15:12.410
<i>Todd, you son of a bitch.</i>

15:12.412 --> 15:14.292
<i>I hate you,
you lucky bastard.</i>

15:15.581 --> 15:17.421
I shouldn't be
shooting this.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.024
<i>Oh, shit!
What the fuck is that?!</i>

15:26.026 --> 15:27.325
<i>What the sh...
what the hell was that?</i>

15:27.327 --> 15:29.427
<i>I know that's not Brian.</i>

15:29.429 --> 15:31.429
<i>- Dude, be careful, man.
- There's something over there.</i>

15:31.431 --> 15:34.132
<i>There's something over there.
It just ran up the ridge.</i>

15:34.134 --> 15:35.934
- Oh, yeah? I know
what's over here, bro.
-<i> I know. I'm serious, man.</i>

15:35.936 --> 15:39.037
<i>There's something fucking
over there, all right?</i>

15:39.039 --> 15:40.505
Brian, you're
a fucking asshole!

15:40.507 --> 15:45.977
- <i> What the fuck, dude?!</i>
<i>God, you are</i>
such an...

15:45.979 --> 15:50.682
You're recording
your little brother's
friends in the woods?

15:50.684 --> 15:52.083
What is wrong
with you?

15:52.085 --> 15:53.618
I got your memory card.
Come get it.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.387
- <i> Yeah, whatever, dude.</i>
- What's going on, man?

15:56.389 --> 15:58.356
- What's going on?
- Your brother's recording us
messing around in the woods.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.992
Now you talking shit!
I will fuck you up!

16:00.994 --> 16:02.560
- What's wrong with you?!
<i>Because of that</i>
fucking memory card!

16:02.562 --> 16:04.095
<i>There was a fucking beast
on the memory card!</i>

16:04.097 --> 16:05.730
Okay, no need to name
Todd's dick.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.632
<i>Oh, that's really
fucking cute.</i>

16:07.634 --> 16:10.268
- You're fucking cute!
- <i> I'm being fucking serious.</i>

16:10.270 --> 16:11.736
- Serious? You're acting like
an eight-year-old.
-<i> Yeah. Come on, bro.</i>

16:11.738 --> 16:13.204
We're about to go shoot
some paintballs.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.039
Film us doing that
or something, man.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.474
<i>That sounds like
a fun fucking time.</i>

16:16.476 --> 16:18.977
<i>- You dicks.
- What'd you say?!</i>

16:18.979 --> 16:21.245
<i>I said I'll</i>
be in the woods.

16:27.119 --> 16:30.989
<i>This is definitely
where I was shooting.</i>

16:30.991 --> 16:34.125
<i>He ran across that ridge.
Right there.</i>

16:42.534 --> 16:44.502
<i>This is definitely
the spot.</i>

16:46.472 --> 16:49.207
I hear something.

16:52.211 --> 16:55.146
<i>See, years ago,</i>

16:55.148 --> 16:57.115
<i>my uncle saw something
out here.</i>

16:59.151 --> 17:01.231
<i>Something that freaked him
the fuck out.</i>

17:03.555 --> 17:07.492
<i>Bad enough that he never</i>
<i>came back to his beloved</i>
<i>hunting cabin.</i>

17:14.066 --> 17:17.035
<i>He never used
the word Bigfoot,</i>

17:17.037 --> 17:20.438
<i>but, man,
if it's out here,</i>

17:22.174 --> 17:25.510
<i>Brian Tover's going to
get it on video.</i>

17:25.512 --> 17:28.246
<i>'Cause that's
what I do, man.</i>

17:28.248 --> 17:30.248
<i>That's my thing.</i>

17:34.186 --> 17:35.386
Hey.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.488
<i>Hey, big man.</i>

17:37.490 --> 17:41.059
<i>We can be cool, man.
We can be... we can be friends.</i>

17:41.061 --> 17:43.561
<i>'Cause, like,
I'm hairy, too, man.</i>

17:45.197 --> 17:46.531
Chicks dig it, man.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.402
<i>Holy fucking shit.</i>

17:55.074 --> 17:57.108
Look at the size
of this print.

18:00.846 --> 18:02.513
Look at that thing.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.218
There's some toe marks in here.

18:09.488 --> 18:11.089
<i>Holy shit.</i>

18:19.365 --> 18:21.325
There's definitely
something moving.

18:24.636 --> 18:26.471
<i>Hello?</i>

18:30.576 --> 18:32.543
<i>Hello?</i>

18:34.813 --> 18:40.118
<i>Holy shit.</i>

18:40.120 --> 18:42.253
- <i>- Holy shit.</i>

18:44.656 --> 18:46.591
<i>I think I see something.</i>

18:50.529 --> 18:53.397
<i>Hey.</i>

18:53.399 --> 18:55.500
<i>We can be friends, man.</i>

19:04.276 --> 19:05.910
<i>Holy shit.</i>

19:07.279 --> 19:08.880
<i>I'm backing off.</i>

19:11.250 --> 19:12.917
<i>It's your house.</i>

19:15.154 --> 19:17.288
<i>You know where I'll be.</i>

19:17.290 --> 19:19.130
<i>Yeah, you know
where I'll be.</i>

19:37.409 --> 19:39.343
<i>It's 1:37 a.m.</i>

19:39.345 --> 19:41.846
I think the noise
from up there at the cabin

19:41.848 --> 19:45.550
is probably scaring
anything off.

19:46.585 --> 19:48.553
It'll come, but...

19:52.457 --> 19:54.457
man, as soon as
those lights go off...

19:56.195 --> 19:58.115
then we're going to
have something.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.199
Should be...

20:01.201 --> 20:03.868
coming from
right over here.

20:05.971 --> 20:08.673
Until then,

20:08.675 --> 20:11.242
I'm just going to wait.

20:15.447 --> 20:17.682
Trying to get some

20:17.684 --> 20:20.918
creatures out of
the woods here.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.887
<i>Just got to mimic
their sounds.</i>

20:22.889 --> 20:25.623
Got to be very delicate.

20:32.431 --> 20:35.233
- What are you doing?
<i>- Huh? Oh, sorry.</i>

20:35.235 --> 20:37.001
<i>Um...</i>

20:37.003 --> 20:38.903
<i>I'm...</i>

20:38.905 --> 20:40.705
<i>just recording some stuff.</i>

20:40.707 --> 20:45.476
I got some GoPros set up
all over the forest.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.945
If anything moves
up in here,

20:47.947 --> 20:50.381
Brian Tover's
going to catch it.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.949
- Why?
<i>- Why?</i>

20:51.951 --> 20:54.285
<i>Ha. Why?</i>

20:54.287 --> 20:56.487
<i>'Cause I'm making a video.
Because it's going to be huge.</i>

20:56.489 --> 21:00.391
<i>This is going to be</i>
<i>like "Alien Autopsy" huge,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

21:00.393 --> 21:04.462
<i>Like YouTube
top fucking ten.</i>

21:04.464 --> 21:07.565
Okay, whatever.
Can you please just be quiet?
We're trying to sleep.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.033
- I'm sorry.
- Good night.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.602
I'll be quiet.
I'm just letting you know.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.671
- Good night.
- All right?

21:13.673 --> 21:17.675
Shit's going to be like...
like "Daily Show" huge.

21:20.546 --> 21:23.347
<i>I think those calls
did the trick.</i>

21:23.349 --> 21:27.418
<i>And now
we motherfucking wait.</i>

21:55.347 --> 21:56.647
Whoa!

21:56.649 --> 21:58.883
God damn it.

22:05.590 --> 22:07.425
There's a noise.

22:14.933 --> 22:17.001
I definitely
heard some sounds.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.969
Just out here.

22:22.941 --> 22:25.109
<i>Sounds like
what I heard yesterday.</i>

22:32.018 --> 22:33.651
<i>Looks like it found me.</i>

22:36.955 --> 22:39.457
- -<i> Fuck.</i>

22:46.031 --> 22:47.932
<i>Holy shit.</i>

22:51.636 --> 22:53.504
<i>Hey, man.</i>

23:01.079 --> 23:02.613
<i>Hello?</i>

23:04.082 --> 23:06.016
<i>Mr. Sasquatch?</i>

23:07.919 --> 23:09.620
<i>I just want to be friends.</i>

23:12.457 --> 23:15.159
<i>Mr. Sasquatch?</i>

23:16.662 --> 23:18.929
Ow, ow, ow! Shit! Ow!
Motherfucker!

23:18.931 --> 23:20.631
What the fuck, dude?!
Ow!

23:20.633 --> 23:22.600
- <i> Ow!</i>

23:22.602 --> 23:25.403
<i>Man, that's fucked up, dude.
You guys are fucking assholes.</i>

23:25.405 --> 23:27.138
You should have seen
your face, man.

23:27.140 --> 23:30.007
Ow! Shit, dude!

23:30.009 --> 23:32.176
You fucking dick, man.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.944
Mr. Sasquatch,

23:33.946 --> 23:36.266
can I suck
your hairy cock?

23:37.984 --> 23:39.717
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

23:41.554 --> 23:43.687
- We should get inside. Go, go.
<i>- Holy shit.</i>

23:43.689 --> 23:45.189
Let's go.

23:55.567 --> 23:57.501
Go, go, go, go, go.

23:57.503 --> 23:59.570
What the fuck?

23:59.572 --> 24:01.906
Turn off the lights.
Turn off the lights.

24:01.908 --> 24:04.074
Get the lights.
Get the lights.
Get the lights.

24:04.076 --> 24:07.578
Todd, what is that?

24:07.580 --> 24:09.146
<i>I don't fucking know.</i>

24:09.148 --> 24:10.581
There's something out there.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.950
That ain't no
fucking animal, man.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.852
- What the fuck is that?
<i>- I know what it is.</i>

24:14.854 --> 24:16.454
Shut up.
Shut up.

24:25.597 --> 24:28.437
Okay, we'll
just stay close
and stay quiet.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.002
<i>Shh.</i>

24:36.208 --> 24:38.142
<i>Guys, get back,
get back, get back.</i>

24:38.144 --> 24:40.511
<i>Do you see anything?</i>

24:44.083 --> 24:45.950
- I want to go.
- Okay, listen.

24:45.952 --> 24:47.485
- I want to go now.
- I know, baby. Listen.

24:47.487 --> 24:49.620
Now might not be
the best time, okay?

24:49.622 --> 24:50.988
- We're safe in the cabin.
<i>- You need to calm down.</i>

24:50.990 --> 24:52.256
Guys, we're safe
in the cabin.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.691
We have to stay calm,
okay?

24:53.693 --> 24:55.192
<i>We're going to be fine</i>

24:55.194 --> 24:57.661
<i>as long as we don't
provoke it, okay?</i>

24:57.663 --> 24:59.730
<i>There's no credible</i>
<i>documented cases of</i>
<i>a Sasquatch attack.</i>

24:59.732 --> 25:01.732
Shut up about
a Sasquatch.

25:01.734 --> 25:02.933
<i>I'm serious.</i>
- Shut up.

25:15.213 --> 25:18.682
<i>We're in fucking</i>
<i>East Texas, okay?</i>
<i>The big fucking thicket.</i>

25:18.684 --> 25:20.518
<i>There's a new sighting
every goddamn week.</i>

25:20.520 --> 25:22.953
Okay, guys.
Whatever it is,

25:22.955 --> 25:25.089
we'll just leave
in the morning, okay?

25:25.091 --> 25:27.057
- When the sun comes up.
- <i> All right.</i>

25:27.059 --> 25:28.579
- Okay?
- <i> Okay.</i>

25:32.097 --> 25:35.199
<i>Turn the fucking
flashlight off.</i>

26:18.710 --> 26:20.110
- -<i> What?</i>

26:20.112 --> 26:22.179
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

26:37.028 --> 26:39.630
Is it gone?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.710
<i>Brian, get your crazy ass
back here.</i>

26:52.712 --> 26:54.011
<i>It's okay.</i>

26:56.615 --> 26:58.282
<i>Brian.</i>

27:05.624 --> 27:07.191
<i>It's gone.</i>

27:07.193 --> 27:09.193
<i>It's okay.
There's nothing out here.</i>

27:13.966 --> 27:15.699
<i>- What was that?!
- What the fuck is that?</i>

27:15.701 --> 27:18.335
What was it?
What'd you see?

27:18.337 --> 27:20.070
- <i> I think I got it on film.</i>
- Got what?

27:20.072 --> 27:21.839
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

27:21.841 --> 27:23.273
You scared it off.
- <i> It ran off.</i>

27:23.275 --> 27:24.875
<i>- You scared it off.
- It ran off.</i>

27:24.877 --> 27:26.644
<i>- Okay.
- I think I got it.</i>

27:26.646 --> 27:29.380
<i>- Shut up!
- Bri, what was it?</i>

27:29.382 --> 27:30.981
<i>It was fucking Bigfoot, dude.</i>

27:32.652 --> 27:34.652
<i>What was that?</i>

27:37.422 --> 27:40.324
<i>- Oh, shit.
- Shut up, shut up.</i>

27:40.326 --> 27:42.359
<i>What the fuck?!</i>

27:42.361 --> 27:43.927
<i>What is it?</i>

27:50.335 --> 27:52.302
You guys,
what is it doing?

27:55.041 --> 27:57.341
<i>Don't open... don't open
the window. Are you crazy?!</i>

28:18.196 --> 28:20.097
<i>- Oh, shit.</i>
- Fuck.

28:24.102 --> 28:27.104
What the fuck?

28:27.106 --> 28:29.173
Shit.

28:31.142 --> 28:33.243
What the...
oh, shit.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.978
<i>Motherfuck.</i>

28:37.315 --> 28:39.950
<i>See if it starts, man.</i>

28:44.222 --> 28:47.191
- Fucking nothing.
- No?

28:47.193 --> 28:49.993
- Come on, bro.
- Nothing!

28:49.995 --> 28:51.895
Brian, let's go back.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.131
<i>I thought Brian said
they were peaceful.</i>

28:54.133 --> 28:56.233
- Brian, I thought you said...
- I thought you said
it was peaceful.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.168
<i>That's what the fucking
book said, all right?</i>

28:58.170 --> 29:00.104
Let's get the fuck back.

29:15.019 --> 29:17.121
We just wait.

29:19.157 --> 29:22.359
We have plenty of food
and we'll just wait until
his uncle gets here.

29:28.032 --> 29:30.000
My uncle's not coming.

29:30.002 --> 29:32.236
Well, he's going to figure out
that we're not back eventually.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.772
I stole the key.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.340
From Uncle Bob.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.108
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

29:40.378 --> 29:42.938
What does he mean
he stole the key?

29:45.183 --> 29:48.051
Because he doesn't let
anyone come out here.

29:48.053 --> 29:50.087
So no one knows
we're here?

29:50.089 --> 29:52.389
No.

29:53.491 --> 29:57.961
Are you fucking
kidding me?!

29:57.963 --> 29:59.396
Why the hell, Matt?!

29:59.398 --> 30:00.798
It's not his fault.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.466
No, it's not
just his fault.

30:02.468 --> 30:05.002
It's your fucking fault, too,
because you knew, too!

30:05.004 --> 30:06.470
<i>- Dora, come on.
- I'm sorry.</i>

30:06.472 --> 30:08.505
<i>Calm down, okay?</i>

30:10.008 --> 30:13.243
Matt, nobody knows
we're out here.

30:13.245 --> 30:15.345
What the fuck
are we going to do, bro?

30:15.347 --> 30:18.115
Dude, hold up.

30:18.117 --> 30:21.819
Matt, I'll go.
I'll go. I'll go.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.488
I'm faster than you.
No offense, but I'm
faster, dude.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.256
I know these woods, okay?

30:26.258 --> 30:29.026
Just take care
of the girls, okay?

30:29.028 --> 30:31.295
Matt, wait.

30:31.297 --> 30:33.363
I'll be back,
okay, babe?

30:33.365 --> 30:36.133
- Baby, you don't
have to do this.
- It's okay.

30:36.135 --> 30:39.436
- It's okay.
- Matt, you don't
have to do this, please.

30:40.605 --> 30:43.173
<i>Hey, listen, bro.</i>

30:43.175 --> 30:45.509
You get cell phone reception,
you make that call,

30:45.511 --> 30:48.212
you get your ass back here,
all right?

30:50.381 --> 30:52.249
- Later, man.
<i>- Good luck, Matt.</i>

30:52.251 --> 30:54.351
<i>Ride fast, bro.</i>
- Like a demon.

30:56.421 --> 30:58.355
<i>Don't stop.</i>

31:41.299 --> 31:43.000
Damn it.

31:55.546 --> 31:59.116
I know this isn't the weekend
you girls expected,

31:59.118 --> 32:01.451
<i>but this shit is serious.</i>

32:01.453 --> 32:04.054
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>how long it's going to be</i>
<i>before Matt gets back</i>

32:04.056 --> 32:06.123
<i>and whatever the fuck's
out there is big</i>

32:06.125 --> 32:08.091
<i>and if it gets in here,
we're fucked.</i>

32:08.093 --> 32:10.160
<i>Okay, we're going to take
all the furniture,</i>

32:10.162 --> 32:12.362
<i>we're going to put it
against the windows and doors.</i>

32:12.364 --> 32:14.464
<i>And, Brian,
what you're going to do</i>

32:14.466 --> 32:17.067
<i>is put down
the fucking camera.</i>

32:17.069 --> 32:19.436
- For real, bro.
- All right. Okay.

32:30.214 --> 32:32.449
<i>- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- What do we got here?</i>

32:34.252 --> 32:35.552
<i>Come check this out, guys.</i>

32:36.988 --> 32:38.155
Oh, shit.

32:40.591 --> 32:42.159
Thank you.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.461
Hello?

32:47.265 --> 32:49.266
<i>Check that out.</i>

32:49.268 --> 32:51.134
Let me see
what's going on.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.656
- Babe, be careful.
- <i> Yeah.</i>

32:58.109 --> 33:01.078
-<i> What you got?</i>
- Let me see if I can find
a light. Hold up.

33:03.648 --> 33:07.250
Oh, sick! Hey, guys!
Hey, we got a gun!

33:07.252 --> 33:09.419
Hell, yeah.
You know what I'm saying?

33:09.421 --> 33:11.621
-<i> Dude, be careful where</i>
you point that thing.
- Watch it.

33:11.623 --> 33:13.590
Do you even know
how to use that?

33:13.592 --> 33:18.295
- Todd, you just pointed
the gun at my face.
- Todd, watch it!

33:20.632 --> 33:22.532
Will you check to see
if it's loaded?

33:22.534 --> 33:25.135
It's probably not even loaded.
Calm down and shit.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.570
<i>Do you even know</i>
how to open it?
- Calm down, calm down.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.305
I'm about to check.

33:28.307 --> 33:31.108
<i>Dude, really?</i>
- It's loaded.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.176
- Y'all going to be trippin...
<i>Do you even know</i>
how to use a gun?

33:33.178 --> 33:34.544
I play paintball.

33:34.546 --> 33:37.114
<i>How different can it be?</i>

33:47.425 --> 33:49.159
Come on.

33:57.101 --> 33:58.435
Thank God. Okay.

34:04.810 --> 34:06.576
<i>9-1-1.
What's your emergency?</i>

34:06.578 --> 34:09.179
Yeah, we're trapped in a cabin
outside Route 212.

34:09.181 --> 34:11.447
- <i> Hello? 9-1...</i>

34:14.351 --> 34:17.219
- <i> 9-1-1. What's your emergency?</i>
- Yeah, my name's Matt Tover.

34:17.222 --> 34:20.223
-<i> Hello? Is anyone there?</i>
- We're outside Route 212
in a cabin.

34:20.225 --> 34:21.525
- <i> Hello? 9-1-1.</i>
- Hello?

34:21.527 --> 34:23.592
Fuck! Come on.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.495
- Come on.

34:30.301 --> 34:33.070
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>
- Please.

34:33.072 --> 34:36.172
Hey, Uncle Bob.
It's...

34:36.175 --> 34:37.841
- - Oh, God.

34:37.842 --> 34:40.610
<i>Matt, is that you? Matt?</i>

34:40.612 --> 34:43.413
- Uncle Bob, it's Matt!
- <i> I'm having a bad connection.</i>

34:43.415 --> 34:46.850
- I'm at the cabin!
- <i> Hello?</i>

34:46.851 --> 34:49.319
-<i> Cabin?</i>
- Uncle Bob, it's Matt.
We're at the cabin!

34:49.321 --> 34:51.554
<i>Matt, did you say the cabin?</i>

34:59.230 --> 35:00.464
What the fuck?!

35:05.369 --> 35:06.536
Come on!

35:41.906 --> 35:44.241
Holy...

36:09.300 --> 36:11.301
<i>Help!</i>

36:11.303 --> 36:13.436
<i>Somebody!</i>

36:25.616 --> 36:26.917
<i>Fuck!</i>

37:07.525 --> 37:09.859
Maybe he found somebody
on the road.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.557
They're probably
on their way back right now.

37:20.605 --> 37:23.873
<i>We knew why my uncle</i>
<i>never let anyone come out</i>
<i>to this place.</i>

37:28.412 --> 37:30.280
<i>We just didn't believe him.</i>

37:38.322 --> 37:40.290
<i>We should have never
come out here.</i>

37:44.462 --> 37:46.329
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

37:51.269 --> 37:54.037
<i>- We should probably get inside.
- It will get dark soon.</i>

37:57.942 --> 37:59.976
Matt's the man, guys.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.878
He's bringing back help.

38:01.880 --> 38:03.647
- All right?

38:03.649 --> 38:05.882
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

38:07.285 --> 38:08.852
<i>Holy fucking shit, man.</i>

38:17.361 --> 38:19.296
- <i>- Go, go!</i>

38:19.298 --> 38:21.431
Come on, Brian, come on!

38:21.433 --> 38:24.501
Oh, shit.
Move something.
Move something.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.636
<i>That's Matt's bike.</i>
- Fuck.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.305
Help me with this, man,
help me with this.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.440
I'm trying, man.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.642
Move it!

38:35.446 --> 38:37.580
Fuck. Fuck.

38:37.582 --> 38:39.616
Fuck. Grab that shit.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.451
<i>Wait, guys. Where is it?</i>

38:41.453 --> 38:43.019
<i>I don't fucking know, man.</i>

38:43.021 --> 38:45.455
<i>That's Matt's bike.</i>

38:45.457 --> 38:47.490
<i>- Oh, shit.
- Do you see it?</i>

38:47.492 --> 38:49.559
<i>I can't see shit.</i>

38:49.561 --> 38:51.328
<i>Check the other window.</i>

38:53.931 --> 38:56.091
- <i> Can you see it?</i>
<i>I can't see</i>
shit out there.

38:57.568 --> 38:59.536
It's waiting for it
to get dark.

39:01.605 --> 39:03.840
It's waiting
for the night.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.630
It's at the generator.

40:11.675 --> 40:14.077
<i>Oh, shit.</i>
- It got the generator.

40:14.079 --> 40:16.946
He's fucking with us.
He's fucking with us.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.916
Okay, okay.
He's fucking with us.

40:19.918 --> 40:21.684
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

40:31.061 --> 40:33.997
<i>Todd, shoot it.</i>

40:33.999 --> 40:35.598
I don't want
to waste a shot.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.120
Fuck that!
Shoot it!

40:38.603 --> 40:40.904
<i>Be careful, man.</i>
- Fuck.

40:40.906 --> 40:43.173
<i>Be careful... oh, shit.</i>

40:45.609 --> 40:49.078
- Where'd it go?
<i>- It's okay.</i>

40:49.080 --> 40:51.014
Shh. It's gone, okay?

40:51.016 --> 40:54.117
It can't get in.
Fucker can't get in, okay?

40:54.119 --> 40:55.985
- He can't get in.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.958
<i>- Get in the room!
- Get in the room!</i>

41:01.960 --> 41:03.193
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

41:06.197 --> 41:09.032
- Help me!
- Go, man.

41:14.705 --> 41:16.573
<i>What do we do now?</i>

41:16.575 --> 41:18.708
<i>Okay.</i>

41:22.046 --> 41:24.514
Okay, guys.
Okay.

41:33.058 --> 41:35.558
Let's go.

41:47.705 --> 41:49.672
<i>Shit.</i>

42:04.723 --> 42:06.022
<i>I can't hold it!</i>

42:20.671 --> 42:23.206
Where did it go?

42:23.208 --> 42:26.075
It ran off.

42:26.077 --> 42:29.312
- It's gone.
<i>- I think you got it.</i>

42:29.314 --> 42:30.713
Yeah.

42:46.997 --> 42:49.999
Help me!

42:52.970 --> 42:54.837
Guys, help her!
Help her!

42:54.839 --> 42:59.008
- Help me!
- Get off her,
motherfucker!

43:02.581 --> 43:04.681
- Beth!

43:07.685 --> 43:10.119
Shit, come on.
Oh, shit.

43:10.121 --> 43:13.256
<i>Brian, help me!
Help me, man!</i>

43:13.258 --> 43:15.592
<i>Go, go!
Get to the cellar!</i>

43:15.594 --> 43:18.995
- <i> Got to get the gun.</i>
Come on.
<i>Get it.</i>

43:38.949 --> 43:40.316
It thinks we're outside.

43:40.318 --> 43:42.619
He doesn't know
we're down here.

44:20.858 --> 44:24.661
- Shh.

44:24.663 --> 44:27.030
<i>- Be quiet, okay, baby?
- Please.</i>

44:32.036 --> 44:34.270
<i>Is it gone?</i>

44:34.272 --> 44:36.205
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

44:36.207 --> 44:38.307
<i>Oh, shit!</i>
<i>He looked at me!</i>
<i>He looked right at me.</i>

44:38.309 --> 44:40.143
Shh.

44:40.145 --> 44:43.012
- <i> He knows we're in here.</i>
- Shut up, shut up.

44:43.014 --> 44:45.682
<i>He knows.</i>
- Quiet. Be quiet. Shut up.

44:45.684 --> 44:48.951
He doesn't know.
He doesn't know.

45:01.699 --> 45:04.100
- <i>- Oh, my God.</i>

45:04.102 --> 45:06.436
<i>He knows.</i>

45:06.438 --> 45:09.072
<i>He fucking knows
that we're here.</i>

45:25.022 --> 45:27.190
<i>Shoot him!</i>

45:46.343 --> 45:47.510
Motherfucker.

45:54.351 --> 45:57.253
Let's go. Let's go.

45:57.255 --> 45:59.288
Are you okay?

46:12.436 --> 46:15.238
Lizzy.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.073
Lizzy.

46:20.277 --> 46:22.145
Is she breathing?

46:23.981 --> 46:25.414
<i>- Is she okay?</i>
- Oh, my God.

46:57.514 --> 46:59.549
<i>Holy shit.</i>

47:14.998 --> 47:16.365
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

47:18.535 --> 47:20.403
<i>It's all clear up here.</i>

48:00.611 --> 48:02.278
<i>We got it.</i>

48:09.453 --> 48:11.988
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

48:11.990 --> 48:13.990
<i>Jesus.</i>

48:58.101 --> 49:00.002
It's his fucking bike.

49:07.110 --> 49:08.544
We have to go.

49:08.546 --> 49:13.082
We can't stay here.

49:13.084 --> 49:15.117
See you soon, man.

49:19.423 --> 49:21.357
<i>What about Liz?</i>

49:23.126 --> 49:25.094
We'll come back
for her body.

49:44.214 --> 49:46.315
Brian,
your cell phone working?

49:47.584 --> 49:49.418
<i>No.</i>

49:49.420 --> 49:51.520
- <i> Yours?</i>
- Fuck, no.

50:01.031 --> 50:04.433
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

50:06.169 --> 50:08.604
<i>It's over this way.</i>

50:08.606 --> 50:10.272
- What?
- <i> It's the trail.</i>

50:10.274 --> 50:12.174
<i>If we take the trail,</i>

50:12.176 --> 50:14.677
<i>it's going to take us
half the time to get to 212.</i>

50:16.480 --> 50:19.081
Look at that shit, man.
There's no road out there.

50:19.083 --> 50:20.416
<i>I've been out here before.</i>

50:22.652 --> 50:25.388
Sure?

50:29.026 --> 50:30.192
<i>Ow.</i>

50:35.198 --> 50:37.166
It's straight down there.

50:39.336 --> 50:41.504
Ah. Fuck.

50:43.206 --> 50:46.675
Some fucking shortcut
you got, man.

50:46.677 --> 50:49.478
<i>Dora. Dora.
Over this way.</i>

50:49.480 --> 50:51.113
- What?
<i>- Over this way.</i>

50:53.183 --> 50:56.452
No, no, no.
We keep going
right up here.

50:56.454 --> 50:59.155
I'm serious.
We keep just walking
right up here.

50:59.157 --> 51:01.323
<i>Dude, I know
these fucking woods.</i>

51:01.325 --> 51:03.559
Todd, he's been
here before.
Come on.

51:03.561 --> 51:06.128
<i>Yeah, whatever.
It better be over this way.</i>

51:06.130 --> 51:07.430
- <i> Come on.</i>

51:07.432 --> 51:09.198
<i>Holy shit.</i>

51:13.437 --> 51:15.404
<i>I think we did
something to it.</i>

51:20.410 --> 51:22.578
What the fuck
did we do?

51:22.580 --> 51:25.314
We didn't do shit.
We didn't do anything.

51:37.427 --> 51:39.361
<i>Holy shit.</i>

51:39.363 --> 51:42.164
<i>It's Matt's bag.</i>

51:42.166 --> 51:43.566
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

51:43.568 --> 51:45.601
- Matt?
- <i> Wait, Dora.</i>

51:45.603 --> 51:47.870
<i>Matt?</i>

51:47.872 --> 51:50.272
- Matt?
<i>Dora, slow down.</i>
Slow down, Dora.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.174
<i>I see more blood.</i>

51:59.249 --> 52:01.383
<i>Oh, God.</i>

52:11.261 --> 52:12.595
Matt...

52:12.597 --> 52:15.431
- No, no, no, no.

52:15.433 --> 52:17.333
Shit.

52:18.602 --> 52:21.203
Hey. Hey, baby.
Watch out, watch out.

52:32.716 --> 52:36.152
Just leave me here.

53:05.549 --> 53:07.850
Slow down, slow down.
I can't see shit.

53:10.187 --> 53:12.221
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

53:12.223 --> 53:13.589
<i>You all right, man?</i>

53:13.591 --> 53:15.291
We got to rest, bro.

53:15.293 --> 53:17.493
Cut that light off.
Don't keep it on too long.

53:17.495 --> 53:19.862
All right.

53:19.864 --> 53:22.631
We got to find some cover,
somewhere not out...

53:22.633 --> 53:24.753
somewhere not
out in the open.

53:33.476 --> 53:36.312
Where the hell's
the 212, man?

53:38.982 --> 53:40.883
<i>We're getting close.</i>

53:40.885 --> 53:43.646
<i>I remember</i>
<i>this little bridge</i>
<i>and this road.</i>

53:51.261 --> 53:52.595
<i>Hey, man.</i>

53:55.599 --> 53:57.633
<i>I'm sorry about Liz, bro.</i>

55:06.970 --> 55:08.604
<i>I think it found us.</i>

55:33.096 --> 55:35.731
<i>Chill out, chill out.</i>

55:38.035 --> 55:40.102
Fuck that.
That thing killed Liz.

55:40.104 --> 55:43.038
-<i> Todd! Todd!</i>
- Brian, stay here.
Stay here.

55:43.040 --> 55:45.007
<i>- I'm right here! Let's go!
- Stay here. Get under that.</i>

55:45.009 --> 55:46.442
<i>Where</i>
this fucker at?!
-<i> Todd!</i>

55:46.444 --> 55:47.710
I can do this all night,
motherfucker!

55:47.712 --> 55:49.578
<i>What are you doing?
Shut up!</i>

55:49.580 --> 55:50.913
<i>How you going to kill
my friends?!</i>

55:50.915 --> 55:52.581
<i>Shut up, Todd. Todd!</i>

55:52.583 --> 55:54.650
I'm killing this motherfucker
right now!

55:54.652 --> 55:58.887
- Where you at?!
- Where you at, huh?!

55:58.889 --> 56:00.689
<i>- You can't even see it.
- What are you shooting at?</i>

56:00.691 --> 56:04.126
- What's up?! I'm right...

56:06.864 --> 56:08.497
- What the fuck?
- <i> Okay, okay.</i>

56:08.499 --> 56:11.133
Oh, shit!

56:11.135 --> 56:14.103
<i>- Fucking save the shell.
- Save the shell, bro.</i>

56:14.105 --> 56:17.106
- Fuck it.
<i>Dude, don't</i>
waste the shells.

56:17.108 --> 56:18.941
The shell's
not coming out, man.

56:18.943 --> 56:21.043
The shell's not
coming out, man.

56:21.045 --> 56:22.878
Yo, we can't stay here.
We got to move.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.481
We got to move.
Dora, come on.
Dora, let's go.

56:25.483 --> 56:26.915
- Let's go, let's go.
- <i> We got to go.</i>

56:26.917 --> 56:28.684
<i>Watch out, watch out!</i>

56:28.686 --> 56:30.452
<i>Go, go, go, go, go, go.</i>

56:30.454 --> 56:32.421
<i>Come on, y'all!</i>

56:32.423 --> 56:34.623
Fuck that shit, nigga!

56:34.625 --> 56:38.026
<i>Go.</i>
Come on, man.
We got to fucking go.

56:38.028 --> 56:40.396
- Brian, come on.
<i>- Careful. Coming.</i>

56:44.401 --> 56:46.402
- You guys see it?
<i>- No.</i>

56:46.404 --> 56:48.670
- Do you see it?
<i>Fucking be</i>
careful, dude.

56:48.672 --> 56:50.839
All right, man.
Where the fuck are we, bro?

56:50.841 --> 56:52.574
Where the fuck are we, bro?

56:52.576 --> 56:54.943
- <i>- What is that?</i>

56:54.945 --> 56:57.079
<i>Guys, guys.
There's people here.</i>

56:57.081 --> 57:00.015
<i>There's people here.
They can help us.</i>

57:00.017 --> 57:02.184
<i>- That looks deserted.
- That looks deserted, Brian.</i>

57:02.186 --> 57:03.719
Where the fuck are we, bro?
Where are we, bro?

57:03.721 --> 57:05.087
<i>Must be close to the 212.</i>

57:05.089 --> 57:06.688
Okay, let's get the fuck
out of here, man.

57:06.690 --> 57:08.190
- Where...

57:08.192 --> 57:10.526
<i>Matt?</i>

57:10.528 --> 57:12.127
<i>It's Matt!</i>
It's Matt!
-<i> Matt!</i>

57:12.129 --> 57:13.962
<i>- Yo, Matt!
- That's Matt.</i>

57:13.964 --> 57:16.598
<i>- Matt!
- Matt!</i>

57:16.600 --> 57:19.535
<i>- Matt!
- Brian.</i>

57:19.537 --> 57:23.505
- Brian, hold on a second.
- Shut up. I can hear him.

57:23.507 --> 57:27.443
<i>Oh, what the hell is that?</i>

57:31.948 --> 57:34.049
- <i>- Matt?</i>

57:34.051 --> 57:36.151
- <i> Where is he?</i>
- Matt.

57:36.153 --> 57:38.120
I don't hear him.

57:38.122 --> 57:40.489
<i>Matt?</i>

57:40.491 --> 57:41.957
<i>Whoa, whoa. Yo.</i>

57:43.626 --> 57:45.494
- <i>- Matt.</i>

57:45.496 --> 57:46.995
<i>He sounds hurt.</i>

57:46.997 --> 57:49.731
<i>- Matt.
- Come on.</i>

57:49.733 --> 57:51.934
<i>Let's go in here.</i>

57:55.572 --> 57:57.005
Slow down.

58:00.910 --> 58:03.145
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

58:03.147 --> 58:05.914
<i>Matt?</i>

58:05.916 --> 58:08.050
<i>Matt?</i>

58:08.052 --> 58:11.186
<i>It's some sort
of a tunnel.</i>

58:11.188 --> 58:13.055
<i>Or a nest
or something.</i>

58:13.057 --> 58:16.091
- <i>- Matt.</i>

58:16.093 --> 58:17.893
<i>He's down there.
He's down there.</i>

58:17.895 --> 58:19.661
<i>- Hold this.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

58:19.663 --> 58:21.563
<i>What are you doing?</i>

58:21.565 --> 58:23.932
- <i> What are you doing?</i>
- I'm going in to get him.

58:23.934 --> 58:26.969
<i>- Come on, dude.
- You can't be going in there.</i>

58:26.971 --> 58:29.037
I don't have a choice.
That's my bro down there.

58:29.039 --> 58:31.673
I've got this.
I'll be able to see
in the dark.

58:31.675 --> 58:34.576
Brian, it's all
we got left.

58:34.578 --> 58:36.912
<i>All right.</i>

58:44.587 --> 58:47.656
<i>He'll be</i> all right, Dora.

58:47.658 --> 58:49.992
<i>You're all right.</i>

59:14.951 --> 59:16.852
<i>Matt?</i>

59:24.961 --> 59:28.931
<i>Fuck.
Which way?</i>

59:28.933 --> 59:32.100
<i>Which way?</i>

59:32.102 --> 59:34.269
<i>- Matt?</i>
- Matt: <i> Huh?</i>

59:34.271 --> 59:36.672
- Huh?
- <i> Matt?</i>

59:36.674 --> 59:38.307
<i>Brian? Brian?!</i>

59:38.309 --> 59:40.642
<i>Matt.</i>

59:42.145 --> 59:44.146
<i>- Brian.
- Matt.</i>

59:44.148 --> 59:46.615
<i>Brian, Brian, over here.</i>

We're at the cabin.

01:02:57.374 --> 01:03:00.175
<i>I'm at the cabin.</i>
<i>I can't hear you.</i>
<i>You're at the cabin?</i>

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:02.544

01:03:41.585 --> 01:03:43.418
So the fuck what?
It's better than nothing.

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.822
If he hears them
or he sees them,
he'll know where we are.

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:49.124
Okay, okay.

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.830
