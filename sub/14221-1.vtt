03:09.520 --> 03:12.160
Yes, Salvatore.
Salvatore Di Vita.

03:16.240 --> 03:19.560
What do you mean
you don't know him?

03:19.720 --> 03:23.240
Yes, that's right.
This is his mother.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.680
I'm calling from Sicily.
I've been trying all day.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.000
I see. He's not there.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.600
Then can you tell me, please--

03:41.120 --> 03:45.520
656-220-56.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.280
Thank you. Good-bye.

03:52.320 --> 03:54.120
Mama, it's no use calling.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.000
He's a busy man.
He could be anywhere.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.200
He won't remember anymore.

04:00.360 --> 04:02.440
Come on, let it go.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.280
He hasn't been here in 30 years.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.000
You know how he is.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.160
He'll remember.

04:13.200 --> 04:17.320
I'm sure he'll remember.
I know him better than you.

04:17.320 --> 04:22.000
If he finds out later
we didn't tell him, he'll be upset.

04:23.360 --> 04:27.760
I'd like to talk
to Mr. Salvatore Di Vita.

04:27.760 --> 04:30.160
This is his mother.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.880
What the hell are you looking at?

05:54.040 --> 05:55.320
Salvatore...

05:56.560 --> 05:58.400
what time is it?

05:59.840 --> 06:01.760
It's very late.

06:04.400 --> 06:08.920
I'm sorry. There was no way
to let you know.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.400
Go back to sleep.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.240
Your mother called.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.280
She took me for someone else.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.280
What did you tell her?

06:25.280 --> 06:28.360
I played along.
I didn't want to disappoint her.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.280
We had a long talk.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.680
She said you haven't visited her
in 30 years.

06:34.800 --> 06:37.800
When she wants to see you,
she comes to Rome.

06:37.920 --> 06:40.440
She called just to say that?

06:44.800 --> 06:46.400
No.

06:46.520 --> 06:50.560
She said someone died--
someone named Alfredo.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.720
The funeral is tomorrow.

06:54.720 --> 06:57.400
Who is he, a relative?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.480
No. Go to sleep.

08:13.840 --> 08:16.880
This boy will be
the death of me.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.880
Toto!

08:43.360 --> 08:45.760
Better late than never.

08:45.840 --> 08:50.200
How often must I say it?
Without the bell, I lose my place.

08:50.280 --> 08:54.360
You're always sleeping.
What do you do at night, eat?

08:54.440 --> 08:58.640
Father, at my house
we don't even eat at noon.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.880
The veterinarian says so.
That's why I'm tired.

09:02.080 --> 09:05.760
I know why you're tired.
Don't think I don't.

09:05.760 --> 09:09.000
Now run along home.
I've something to do.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.000
- Can I come?
- No, you cannot.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.840
- Yes, yes!
- Toto, out!

09:13.920 --> 09:16.000
I want to! I want to!

09:26.720 --> 09:28.080
Alfredo.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.280
You can start.

09:47.080 --> 09:49.400
Here we go again.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.480
Fix the picture!

10:39.520 --> 10:42.760
<i>Pepe, one day we'll have it all.</i>

10:43.480 --> 10:46.240
<i>We'll go away together...</i>

10:47.120 --> 10:49.240
<i>live the easy life...</i>

10:49.240 --> 10:51.680
<i>where no one knows us.</i>

10:51.720 --> 10:54.840
<i>Forget it.</i>

10:54.880 --> 10:57.640
<i>You don't love me anymore.</i>

11:13.080 --> 11:14.920
<i>It would be nice...</i>

11:15.080 --> 11:17.360
<i>if you could spare
a few kind words.</i>

11:17.440 --> 11:19.480
<i>I can't.</i>

11:19.600 --> 11:21.680
<i>Oh, well. Thanks anyway.</i>

13:00.840 --> 13:03.520
One pair, two pair!

13:03.560 --> 13:06.360
One hundred lire! Real nylon!

13:22.280 --> 13:24.640
You mustn't come here.

13:24.840 --> 13:27.800
Can't you get it through
your thick skull?

13:27.840 --> 13:30.000
If the film catches fire...

13:30.200 --> 13:33.120
little as you are,
you'll go up-- voom!

13:33.120 --> 13:36.080
""And turn into a lump of coal.''

13:38.520 --> 13:41.480
Like to wag your tongue, eh?

13:41.560 --> 13:43.560
One day I'll cut it off.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.880
Like that.

14:00.520 --> 14:02.920
Can I have it?

14:02.960 --> 14:05.240
Come on, can I have it?

14:06.520 --> 14:08.360
Well, can I?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.040
What, are you deaf?

14:13.040 --> 14:17.040
I have to splice it back in
before I return the film.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.560
You're such a pest!

14:19.600 --> 14:24.000
Why didn't you splice these in
when you gave the films back?

14:26.720 --> 14:31.160
Sometimes I can't find
the right place, so they stay here.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.600
Anyway, they kiss too much.

14:34.760 --> 14:37.080
Then I can have them.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.440
No. Now look, come here.

14:41.520 --> 14:44.360
Before I kick your behind,
let's make a deal.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.240
All those are yours--
a present.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.720
Thanks.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.880
But one, you keep out of here,
and two, they stay with me. Got it?

14:53.000 --> 14:54.160
All right.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.760
Right. Then we agree.
Now scram.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.720
What kind of a deal is that?

15:10.720 --> 15:14.040
If they're mine,
how come you keep them?

15:18.200 --> 15:20.560
Don't come back,
or I'll split your head open!

15:29.720 --> 15:31.040
""Shoot first, think later.''

15:31.120 --> 15:36.120
""This is no job for cowards,
you backstabbing dog!''

15:40.400 --> 15:44.640
""Hey, you! Hands off the gold,
you rotten bastard!''

15:48.320 --> 15:51.720
""You dirty swine,
stay away from me...

15:52.680 --> 15:55.120
or I'll smash your face in.''

16:11.880 --> 16:16.680
Mama, if the war's over,
why doesn't Papa come back?

16:17.800 --> 16:21.040
He'll come back, you'll see.
One of these days.

16:22.360 --> 16:24.920
I don't remember him.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.440
Where's Russia?

16:27.240 --> 16:29.640
It takes years to get there...

16:29.680 --> 16:31.880
and years to come back.

16:33.680 --> 16:36.040
Go to bed. It's late.

17:10.319 --> 17:13.599
You can fool your mother,
but not me!

17:14.839 --> 17:19.240
Get your diploma
and join the police! Lazybones!

17:20.040 --> 17:22.000
Good-for-nothing!

17:28.280 --> 17:30.200
Get a move on!

17:42.400 --> 17:45.360
Well?
What is 5 times 5?

17:48.600 --> 17:49.520
Thirty.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.560
Silence!

17:58.640 --> 18:01.000
The fives times table, dimwit.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.960
One times 5 is 5...

18:03.040 --> 18:05.760
2 times 5 is 1 0...

18:05.760 --> 18:08.240
3 times 5 is 1 5...

18:08.320 --> 18:10.120
4 times 5 is 20.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.360
5 times 5?

18:13.880 --> 18:14.880
Forty.

18:24.760 --> 18:26.360
Silence!

18:28.040 --> 18:29.200
Boccia...

18:30.320 --> 18:32.240
twenty-five.

18:32.440 --> 18:36.800
Learn your times tables,
or you'll never get a job.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.120
For the last time...

18:40.160 --> 18:41.880
what is 5 times 5?

18:41.920 --> 18:42.920
Christmas!

19:21.000 --> 19:24.040
I paid to get in.
I'm seeing the movie.

19:24.760 --> 19:27.960
Get down from there, you rascal.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.840
Go back to your seat.

19:29.840 --> 19:34.080
Worse than rabbits.
They're all over the place.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.040
Little monsters.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.360
<i>I'm off to Oregon.</i>

19:46.400 --> 19:48.400
<i>Wait for me at my ranch.</i>

19:49.600 --> 19:51.600
<i>Wait for a dead man?</i>

19:51.680 --> 19:54.200
<i>A star-studded cast...</i>

19:54.200 --> 19:55.800
<i>featuring John Wayne...</i>

19:55.920 --> 19:57.040
<i>Claire Trevor--</i>

20:10.200 --> 20:12.280
Hello, everyone!

20:12.440 --> 20:15.040
- Can't I say hello?
- It's a double feature today.

20:15.160 --> 20:17.040
So? I'm here to sleep.

20:18.440 --> 20:20.920
- Got some smokes?
- American.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.160
Cut the news, Alfredo!

20:33.120 --> 20:35.720
Shut up!
This stuff is important!

20:35.760 --> 20:39.520
<i>The men and women
who fought in secret...</i>

20:39.600 --> 20:42.560
<i>our brave partisans,
are reunited in Rome...</i>

20:42.680 --> 20:44.720
<i>for the first Resistance Rally...</i>

20:44.800 --> 20:46.920
<i>organized by the CVL.</i>

20:46.920 --> 20:49.520
<i>Parri is the acting president.
Sandro Pertini--</i>

21:04.600 --> 21:06.800
Good evening, everyone!

21:09.040 --> 21:10.720
Will you show the movie already?

21:10.880 --> 21:12.600
Sit down and be quiet!

21:35.720 --> 21:39.080
- What does it say?
- I'm illiterate.

21:39.160 --> 21:40.320
You too?

21:49.560 --> 21:52.160
<i>Twelve hours ofblood and sweat...</i>

21:52.200 --> 21:57.000
<i>and what they bring home
barely keeps them from starving.</i>

21:58.320 --> 22:01.160
<i>Yet when they pulled in
their nets...</i>

22:01.320 --> 22:03.720
<i>they were full.</i>

22:04.880 --> 22:07.560
<i>They wanted 750 lire.</i>

22:07.640 --> 22:09.080
<i>It's always the same.</i>

22:09.400 --> 22:12.440
<i>But they don't pay us enough.</i>

22:12.440 --> 22:14.440
<i>That's how it's always been.</i>

22:14.440 --> 22:16.600
<i>And it's never going to change.</i>

22:43.480 --> 22:45.320
I knew it!

22:46.520 --> 22:50.240
In 20 years I've never seen
a kiss on the screen!

22:51.240 --> 22:54.200
As if they'd let us!

22:56.800 --> 22:58.960
Kiss my ass!

23:54.920 --> 23:57.800
- Don Vincenzo.
- You and you, to work.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.800
What about me?

23:59.840 --> 24:02.520
Go ask Stalin for a job.

24:02.520 --> 24:05.840
His day will come.
You watch.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.640
I always get left out.

24:09.600 --> 24:12.920
Good movie.
The kid really acted well.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.760
Too bad he was so unlucky.

24:14.760 --> 24:17.760
What a jackass to buy that boat.

24:17.760 --> 24:21.320
Idiot, you didn't get it at all.

24:22.160 --> 24:27.320
Right, boys,
you work from dawn to dusk.

24:27.360 --> 24:30.200
And don't ask how much it pays.

24:57.800 --> 24:59.960
I've been looking for you all day.
Did you get the milk?

25:01.840 --> 25:03.840
Where's the money?

25:05.160 --> 25:06.520
It got stolen.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.120
You spent it at the movies?

25:12.160 --> 25:15.240
Movies, always movies!

25:18.360 --> 25:19.960
Signora Maria, stop.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.480
Leave him alone. Take it easy.

25:23.960 --> 25:26.760
And you,
why do you tell lies?

25:26.800 --> 25:28.600
You know you got in for free.

25:28.760 --> 25:31.520
Tell your mother.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.840
Maybe he lost the money inside.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.200
- How much did you have?
- Fifty lire.

25:38.080 --> 25:42.160
What did you find
under the seats tonight?

25:45.960 --> 25:47.240
A comb.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.560
Two shoe lifts.

25:56.040 --> 25:58.200
- A can of tobacco--
- And...

25:58.880 --> 26:01.960
fifty lire.

26:07.880 --> 26:09.880
See?

26:09.960 --> 26:12.040
Thank you, Alfredo.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.640
I knew where you were going.

26:26.680 --> 26:29.480
The square is mine!
It's mine!

26:33.480 --> 26:35.560
It's midnight. Midnight!

26:35.640 --> 26:38.360
Out! Shoo!
I have to close the square.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.280
Hard on the feet, eh, Father?

28:07.360 --> 28:10.600
On the way there, it's all downhill
and all the saints help out.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.920
But coming back,
the saints just watch.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.920
If that's God's will.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.080
See you tonight.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.840
What's wrong?

28:26.960 --> 28:28.440
Your foot this time.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.880
It's always something with you.
What can I do?

28:36.600 --> 28:39.560
Alfredo,
did you know my father?

28:39.640 --> 28:42.360
What a question.
Of course I knew him.

28:42.440 --> 28:46.920
Tall, thin, friendly guy
with a big moustache like mine.

28:47.080 --> 28:50.520
Always smiling.
He looked a lot like Clark Gable.

28:52.240 --> 28:55.320
Now that I'll be
in fifth grade...

28:55.400 --> 28:58.400
I don't say I should
come in the booth...

28:58.520 --> 29:01.600
but can't we at least be friends?

29:01.640 --> 29:06.440
""I choose my friends for looks,
my enemies for intelligence.''

29:06.520 --> 29:09.640
You're too sly to be my friend.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.400
I always tell my children...

29:12.440 --> 29:15.640
""Be careful
how you choose your friends.''

29:15.640 --> 29:18.200
You haven't got any children.

29:20.240 --> 29:23.360
When I do, I'll tell them.

29:27.480 --> 29:31.120
Don't cry, don't cry.
It's all right.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.880
The fire's out.
It's over. Mama's here.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.640
What happened?

29:37.680 --> 29:39.640
Monster!

29:39.640 --> 29:42.440
Your little sister
could have burned to death!

29:42.480 --> 29:44.800
It's all your fault!

29:48.840 --> 29:52.760
I told you not to keep your film
under the bed by the fire pan.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.720
Even the photographs burned!

30:04.880 --> 30:07.840
He could have set
the house on fire!

30:08.640 --> 30:11.840
You and your stupid movies!

30:13.080 --> 30:16.840
Aren't you ashamed to play
with a little boy at your age?

30:16.960 --> 30:19.600
What did I do?

30:19.640 --> 30:21.240
Who gave him the film?

30:23.240 --> 30:26.200
Don't do it again.
He's crazy. Crazy, I tell you!

30:26.240 --> 30:28.240
All I hear about is movies
and Alfredo.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.800
Alfredo and movies!

30:31.160 --> 30:34.200
Swear you won't let him in again.
Swear it!

30:36.280 --> 30:38.320
You have my word.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.920
May God grant me one wish.

30:43.080 --> 30:45.560
May he send your father home
to whip you!

30:45.600 --> 30:49.360
Papa won't come back,
and I know why.

30:49.360 --> 30:50.800
He's dead.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.280
That's not true.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.840
I'll show you. He'll come back.

31:26.680 --> 31:30.840
""Thus man's good
and evil deeds do pass...

31:30.840 --> 31:34.960
while time flows on like a river.''

31:53.840 --> 31:56.240
They smoke like chimneys!

32:03.760 --> 32:05.680
No. Go buy a ticket.

32:25.880 --> 32:27.720
What was that?

32:28.960 --> 32:32.120
I'll make mincemeat out of you!
You'll have to reckon with me!

32:46.040 --> 32:48.080
Signora Anna!

33:08.760 --> 33:12.480
Don't blame me. Your wife
told me to bring your lunch.

33:13.920 --> 33:17.640
I told my mother
you didn't give me the film.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.320
It wasn't your fault.

33:19.320 --> 33:24.120
I thought it was a joke
about film catching fire.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.080
I just wanted to tell you.
Now I'll go.

33:29.560 --> 33:32.840
Toto, come here.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.080
Come on and sit down.

33:40.120 --> 33:43.760
Now listen.
I got into this business at age ten.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.480
Back then, we didn't have
fancy machines.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.320
Movies were silent.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.840
You turned the projector by hand...

33:53.920 --> 33:55.320
with a crank.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.480
All the livelong day!

33:57.480 --> 34:01.120
And that damn crank
was so hard.

34:01.240 --> 34:04.880
If you got tired
and slowed down a bit...

34:06.160 --> 34:08.840
like a shot-- voom!--
everything went up in flames.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.960
So why not teach me?

34:13.960 --> 34:17.080
Now that there's no crank
and it's easier.

34:17.840 --> 34:20.880
Because I don't want to.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.560
This is no job for you.

34:23.639 --> 34:25.920
You're like a slave...

34:25.920 --> 34:27.920
and always by yourself.

34:27.920 --> 34:31.280
You see a film 1 00 times.
You've nothing else to do.

34:31.280 --> 34:35.199
You talk to Greta Garbo
and Tyrone Power like an idiot.

34:35.280 --> 34:37.159
You work like a dog.

34:37.280 --> 34:41.080
Even holidays--
Easter, Christmas.

34:41.080 --> 34:43.600
You only get Good Friday off.

34:43.719 --> 34:47.159
And if they hadn't
stuck Christ on a cross...

34:47.159 --> 34:49.560
we'd even work then.

34:49.600 --> 34:52.280
So why don't you change jobs?

34:59.080 --> 35:00.920
Because I'm a nitwit.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.440
Who else around here
could run a projector?

35:06.680 --> 35:11.080
Nobody. It takes
an imbecile like me.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.680
I never had any luck.

35:15.680 --> 35:18.200
When I was little,
there was a war.

35:19.080 --> 35:22.480
When I grew up,
there was another war.

35:25.000 --> 35:29.120
So, you want to be a stick-in-the-mud
like me? How about it?

35:31.880 --> 35:33.360
Attaboy, Toto.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.560
I'm telling you
for your own good.

35:37.560 --> 35:42.200
In here, you suffocate in summer
and freeze to death in winter.

35:42.280 --> 35:44.440
You breathe all these fumes.

35:44.440 --> 35:47.240
And you earn chicken feed.

35:47.680 --> 35:50.320
Don't you like
anything about it?

35:50.440 --> 35:52.240
Oh, you get used to it.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.240
Sometimes you can hear...

35:54.240 --> 35:56.440
that the house is full of people...

35:56.440 --> 35:58.600
laughing and having fun.

35:58.640 --> 36:01.040
Then you're happy too.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.760
It makes you feel good
to hear them.

36:03.800 --> 36:06.360
Like you're the one
who made them laugh--

36:07.200 --> 36:10.560
who made them forget
their troubles.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.320
That part I like.

36:24.320 --> 36:28.080
I might as well be speaking Greek!
What're you up to?

36:28.280 --> 36:31.800
You pretend to listen,
then you trick me!

36:31.840 --> 36:35.000
Your mother's right!
You're crazy!

36:36.440 --> 36:40.200
How'd the rascal do it?
He learned by watching.

36:42.600 --> 36:46.720
I'm telling the cashier
not to let you in!

36:46.800 --> 36:52.400
And I'll see Father Adelfio!
No more altar boy! Finished!

36:55.000 --> 36:56.760
Up yours!

37:04.280 --> 37:08.600
I got it! I won!
I won the football lottery!

37:15.400 --> 37:19.160
The Neapolitan won the lottery!

37:20.160 --> 37:24.440
Hey, Ciccio from Naples
won the lottery!

37:25.800 --> 37:29.560
It's always the northerners
who get lucky.

38:02.040 --> 38:04.800
The square is mine! All mine!

38:07.880 --> 38:11.400
Hold still!
Got ants in your pants?

38:12.560 --> 38:14.800
You got a lice factory up here.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.520
Beat it.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.000
What're you after?

38:33.000 --> 38:34.840
Get out of here.

38:43.840 --> 38:48.360
A merchant owns two stores.

38:49.920 --> 38:53.280
In one, he sells fruit.

38:54.480 --> 38:56.480
Be seated.

38:56.520 --> 38:57.720
Professor...

38:57.800 --> 39:01.680
the night-school students are here
for the grade-school diploma exam.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.120
Silence!

40:57.280 --> 41:00.000
Rotten little stinker!

41:00.560 --> 41:03.080
- Toto, help me.
- Silence!

41:04.560 --> 41:06.720
I can't do this damn thing!

42:25.120 --> 42:27.280
<i>Francesco Messana...</i>

42:27.360 --> 42:29.320
<i>you're under arrest.</i>

42:33.520 --> 42:35.280
Good riddance!

42:44.760 --> 42:47.840
Kiss my ass!
Pencil pusher!

42:47.840 --> 42:50.720
Right here is where
it can catch fire.

42:50.840 --> 42:55.800
If it does, cut here and here,
or the whole reel will burn. Got it?

43:01.360 --> 43:05.200
Never!
We'll never have that here.

43:05.240 --> 43:07.600
Which side is the gelatin on?

43:09.720 --> 43:12.120
It tastes good.

43:21.120 --> 43:25.240
The shipping invoice for the film.
Always keep these.

43:25.400 --> 43:27.000
I will, Alfredo.

43:27.120 --> 43:28.880
Don't ever forget them.

43:46.120 --> 43:50.720
This is for you.
Today you load the reels yourself.

43:51.840 --> 43:55.720
- It's so high!
- Now you can run it alone.

43:55.800 --> 43:58.080
Hold it.

44:01.680 --> 44:04.600
- What a build!
- My turn!

44:04.680 --> 44:08.400
Say good-bye to Peppino.
He's leaving for Germany.

44:17.160 --> 44:19.680
Why won't you say good-bye?

44:19.760 --> 44:22.960
My father says he's a communist.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.920
God keep you, Mama.

44:25.040 --> 44:27.240
Will he really find work
in Germany?

44:27.360 --> 44:30.320
Who knows?
It's an adventure.

44:30.400 --> 44:32.280
All you can do is hope.

44:33.600 --> 44:35.520
Screw this country!

44:36.640 --> 44:40.880
Go work in Germany,
you and your Stalin.

44:40.880 --> 44:42.800
Good-bye, Mama.

44:43.760 --> 44:47.400
Good-bye, Peppino!
Come back soon!

44:47.400 --> 44:49.400
We'll see you.

44:54.680 --> 44:58.480
Lucky thing Germany
is closer than Russia.

45:02.520 --> 45:05.440
<i>After six years,
the return of spring fashion.</i>

45:05.840 --> 45:08.200
<i>Fresh and breezy...</i>

45:08.280 --> 45:10.880
<i>unlike the stodgy wartime styles.</i>

45:27.960 --> 45:30.000
I'll make mincemeat out of you!

45:30.120 --> 45:31.960
""You'll have to reckon with me!''

45:53.280 --> 45:55.280
<i>Another sad chapter...</i>

45:55.280 --> 45:57.240
<i>in the tragedy
of our men in Russia.</i>

45:57.920 --> 45:59.400
<i>The Defense Ministry...</i>

45:59.520 --> 46:02.440
<i>has released a new list
of Italian soldiers killed in battle...</i>

46:02.560 --> 46:05.280
<i>until now considered missing.</i>

46:05.400 --> 46:09.960
<i>The names will be posted
by local military authorities...</i>

46:10.000 --> 46:13.960
<i>who will directly notify
the families involved.</i>

46:18.200 --> 46:21.840
<i>However, we don't know
where he's buried.</i>

46:21.880 --> 46:25.240
<i>Here's the form for the pension.
Sign it, please.</i>

48:57.240 --> 49:00.640
Get out! Go home!
We can't have another show!

49:00.640 --> 49:05.240
It's late. Be reasonable.
We can't show it again!

49:07.280 --> 49:09.760
Some people
sat through it twice!

49:12.600 --> 49:15.800
We've been waiting for an hour!

49:20.720 --> 49:23.920
Tomorrow we'll have
another movie.

49:23.960 --> 49:28.440
A western. Word of honor!
Go home to bed.

49:31.960 --> 49:35.000
They'll wreck the Paradiso!
All hell will break loose!

49:38.640 --> 49:41.520
Alfredo, let us in!

49:41.600 --> 49:44.600
What can I do?

49:48.800 --> 49:51.760
""A mob doesn't think.

49:51.760 --> 49:53.960
They don't know
what they're doing.''

49:54.960 --> 49:58.960
<i>Spencer Tracy said that in Fury.</i>

49:59.080 --> 50:01.920
Well, what do you say?

50:02.120 --> 50:05.720
Shall we let the poor devils
see their film?

50:07.040 --> 50:09.920
Sure. But how?

50:12.000 --> 50:16.800
""If you have no faith in me,
have faith in what you see.''

50:16.840 --> 50:19.960
Now get your butt off that stool.

50:23.360 --> 50:25.080
Get ready.

50:26.680 --> 50:29.160
Abracadabra.

50:31.160 --> 50:33.560
Look the other direction.

51:06.640 --> 51:09.360
Go look out the window.

51:14.120 --> 51:16.640
Alfredo, it's beautiful.

51:17.480 --> 51:20.720
Over there! It's the movie!

51:23.680 --> 51:25.480
Bravo, Alfredo!

51:29.640 --> 51:32.240
Thank you, Alfredo!

51:38.760 --> 51:41.240
What's going on?

51:42.840 --> 51:44.960
It's a movie!

51:47.520 --> 51:49.320
To hell with you all!

51:55.560 --> 51:58.080
There's no sound!

51:58.120 --> 52:00.840
Shall we make them happy?

52:32.680 --> 52:34.280
Want to go down?

52:35.560 --> 52:36.880
Go on.

52:52.920 --> 52:55.040
- Look.
- Good Lord!

53:00.600 --> 53:03.360
And Nunzio, half price.

53:15.240 --> 53:18.120
You have to buy tickets, folks.

53:21.480 --> 53:22.640
Reduced rates.

53:22.680 --> 53:25.560
Up yours! The square
belongs to everyone!

53:25.640 --> 53:27.560
Oh, no!

53:27.640 --> 53:31.440
The square is mine! Don't joke
about that or you'll piss me off!.

55:12.880 --> 55:14.320
Someone, help me!

55:39.280 --> 55:42.560
- Nunzio, what's wrong with you?
- I can't breathe!

56:09.200 --> 56:11.520
Alfredo! Alfredo!

56:18.880 --> 56:21.520
Help! Help!

56:25.920 --> 56:27.520
Help!

56:38.600 --> 56:41.400
Poor Alfredo.
What a shame.

56:45.080 --> 56:47.160
All burned!

56:50.160 --> 56:52.160
It all burned down!

57:07.640 --> 57:09.720
What do we do now?

57:09.840 --> 57:13.440
We have no more entertainment.
Nothing.

57:13.600 --> 57:16.680
Where will we get the money
to rebuild?

57:18.760 --> 57:22.400
Take a look at Ciccio.
So spiffy, you'd hardly know him.

57:22.440 --> 57:25.760
Who has that kind of money?

57:33.600 --> 57:36.440
The new Cinema Paradiso!

57:39.720 --> 57:41.680
Come in, come in!

58:10.640 --> 58:13.680
This theater is for you!

58:21.040 --> 58:24.400
He's just a boy.
What about labor laws?

58:24.400 --> 58:28.120
I got the license
through connections.

58:28.160 --> 58:30.400
Don't ask me
how their minds work.

58:30.400 --> 58:35.120
Officially, I'm the projectionist,
but the money goes to Toto.

58:35.200 --> 58:39.160
Stay on your toes, Toto.
No sleeping.

58:39.240 --> 58:41.400
We've had enough disasters.

58:41.400 --> 58:44.280
Do what poor Alfredo taught you.

58:44.280 --> 58:46.040
And God bless you.

58:47.240 --> 58:48.880
Thank you, Father.

58:48.920 --> 58:54.080
What is this, a funeral?
Life goes on! Gaiety! Music!

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.160
Get a load of that!

01:00:33.720 --> 01:00:35.560
Our Father!

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.800
By God, they're kissing!

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:05.120
I won't watch pornography.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.720
Three cheers for Ciccio!

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.360
Any room for me
in this new paradise?

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:52.320
Bring him home after you close.

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.120
I'm going, Alfredo.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.880
I'm glad you're here.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.840
How're things at school?

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.200
Fine, but now that I'm working...

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.240
maybe I won't go anymore.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.240
No. No, Toto.

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.840
Don't do that.

01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.320
You'll end up
with egg on your face.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:18.040
Why? What does that mean?

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.960
It means...

01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:25.520
that this isn't your real work.

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.280
Right now
the Paradiso needs you...

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.320
and you need the Paradiso...

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:31.680
but it's a stopgap.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.400
One day you'll go on...

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.400
to other things.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.480
Things...

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.000
that are more important.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.040
Definitely more important.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:50.440
I know.

01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.680
Now that I've lost my sight,
I see better.

01:02:54.360 --> 01:02:56.400
Things I never saw before.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.840
All thanks to you,
who saved my life.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.760
I won't forget it.

01:03:02.840 --> 01:03:05.600
And don't look like that.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:08.160
I'm not senile yet.
Want proof?

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.520
Well, let's see.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.480
For example...

01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.520
right now, the film's out of focus.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.680
Go check.

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:25.680
You're right!
It's out of focus.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.280
How'd you know?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:31.200
Too hard to explain.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:42.800
Only two days?

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.800
What do I care
if you've rented all the prints?

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:48.520
I've only had it two days.
They'll rip my head off here!

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.880
I wouldn't make it
even if I opened at 8:00 a.m.!

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.480
This is a big town,
and you know it!

01:03:56.520 --> 01:03:59.360
If you screw me over,
I'll go straight to Rome!

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.360
You'll pay for this!

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.240
Don't mess with me,
'cause I'll split your skull open!

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.800
Don Ciccio, I have an idea.

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.000
Do you remember
that old abandoned movie theater?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.440
What about it?

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:16.280
The projector's rusted,
but I could fix it in a couple of days.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:19.000
You have the place cleaned up...

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:23.720
hire a projectionist from the city,
and we'll have two theaters!

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.560
Bullshit!

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:27.480
Don't start, Toto.

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.720
Titanus will only let me have
one print.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.720
If I ask for another one,
they'll cut my head off...

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:35.920
and play ball with it.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.680
Who says we need two copies?

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.320
Well, don't we?

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.680
We see the crib.
The child's asleep.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.240
<i>Help her.!</i>

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.720
""The lawyer told me.
Now I know.''

01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:51.040
<i>The lawyer told me.
Now I know.</i>

01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:56.480
""And everyone must know.
Yes, everyone must know.''

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:58.280
<i>Everyone must know.</i>

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:02.800
""You believe me?''

01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:07.360
""Yes, I believe you.''

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.600
""Our own home.
How I've dreamed of it!''

01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:32.800
""Tonino!''

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:38.760
""Mama.''

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.040
""The End.''

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:12.600
I don't like it!
I don't like it!

01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:20.640
I cut the end credits
to go faster.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:25.120
Hurry back with part one.
I'll show a newsreel.

01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:27.680
I'll call the police.
Take him.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.880
Just a minute.
Just a minute!

01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:43.560
What do you want?

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:54.840
Give me part two.
Here's part one.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.560
Hurry, the house is packed.

01:08:00.200 --> 01:08:04.960
What are you doing? Hurry up!
Light the coal, come on!

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.880
- The audience is protesting!
- Get her rolling!

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.520
Bunch of animals!
Quiet!

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.640
To hell with it!

01:08:47.050 --> 01:08:48.970
Toto, what's going on?

01:08:49.050 --> 01:08:51.170
What the hell is he doing?

01:08:53.850 --> 01:08:56.689
Come on, Toto.
They're gonna explode!

01:08:56.729 --> 01:08:58.729
It's been a half hour!

01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:00.689
What can I do?

01:09:02.569 --> 01:09:06.050
Where is that son of a jackass?
I'll be ruined!

01:09:07.130 --> 01:09:10.050
Calm down, calm down.

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:16.210
I'll have you know,
just to see this movie...

01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:19.010
I left my wife home
sick in bed...

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:21.569
and I haven't seen a thing.

01:09:21.569 --> 01:09:24.729
If it's not here in ten minutes,
give us back our money...

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:27.130
me and everyone else here...

01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:29.569
or I'll wreck the place
with this cane!

01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:39.090
Calm down!
Calm down and let me talk.

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:42.050
Tell you what.
I'll show part one over again.

01:09:48.250 --> 01:09:51.250
Quiet, quiet!

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:55.210
I've seen the whole movie.
I'll tell you the plot.

01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:27.250
Boccia, what happened?

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:36.570
- What are you doing?
- I'm in heaven.

01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:38.890
Get out of here!

01:10:39.010 --> 01:10:40.610
Scram!

01:10:41.490 --> 01:10:42.770
It feels so good!

01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:17.610
What's the idea?
Watch the screen, you perverts!

01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:28.370
Don't touch.

01:12:21.690 --> 01:12:24.450
I told you:
It doesn't catch fire.

01:12:28.610 --> 01:12:30.850
Progress always comes too late.

01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:52.490
<i>Workers--</i>

01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:21.130
That's right.

01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:23.850
Now you've got it.

01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:27.210
Come on, take it easy.

01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:29.570
Don't be afraid.

01:13:29.650 --> 01:13:32.370
Do I really have to squeeze
a lemon on it if it bleeds?

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:34.370
Lemon?

01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:39.410
Whoever told you such bullshit?

01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:43.770
That's right, keep going.

01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:47.930
That's right. See?

01:13:48.570 --> 01:13:50.770
It's not dangerous, see?

01:13:50.770 --> 01:13:52.290
That's right, keep going.

01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:07.450
Now you're really a man.

01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:11.690
What am I saying?
You're not a man, you're a bull!

01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:55.090
She's new.

01:14:55.930 --> 01:14:57.810
Not bad.

01:14:57.810 --> 01:14:59.210
She looks nice.

01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:03.170
Her father's the bank manager.
Pride, pomp and circumstance.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:06.730
Jerks off with his shirt
to keep his hands clean.

01:15:11.130 --> 01:15:12.970
Go, man, go!

01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:30.250
Excuse me.

01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:38.410
You dropped this.

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:40.010
Oh, thanks.

01:15:40.010 --> 01:15:42.170
I didn't even notice.

01:15:43.770 --> 01:15:46.170
My name's Salvatore.
What's yours?

01:15:46.210 --> 01:15:48.610
Elena.
My name's Elena.

01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:53.370
I wanted to tell you, well,
the other day at the station--

01:15:58.490 --> 01:16:01.410
<i>It's Charlie Chaplin's
Modern Times, right, Toto?</i>

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:03.010
Yes, that's right.

01:16:04.090 --> 01:16:07.250
I know that film by heart.

01:16:07.410 --> 01:16:11.330
While I was showing it for the
first time in 1 940, my first wife died.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:15.370
They kept it from me all day,
to keep the theater open.

01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:18.410
I found out after the last show.

01:16:20.610 --> 01:16:22.370
I lost my mind.

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:27.290
It's the kind of thing
you never forget.

01:16:29.370 --> 01:16:32.290
The small projector?
Your footage?

01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:33.970
What do you see?

01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:37.690
Slaughterhouse workers
butchering a calf.

01:16:37.690 --> 01:16:41.930
Blood all over the floor,
like a lake.

01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:44.530
Another calf passes over the lake...

01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:46.810
on his way to being slaughtered.

01:16:52.930 --> 01:16:55.450
Why'd you stop?
What do we see?

01:16:55.530 --> 01:16:59.490
Nothing. We don't see anything.
It's all fuzzy.

01:17:02.330 --> 01:17:03.370
A woman.

01:17:05.570 --> 01:17:07.530
It's a woman.

01:17:08.690 --> 01:17:11.490
Yes, a girl I saw
at the station.

01:17:12.170 --> 01:17:14.570
What's she like?

01:17:14.690 --> 01:17:16.490
She's very nice.

01:17:17.290 --> 01:17:21.690
My age, slim,
long brown hair.

01:17:21.810 --> 01:17:25.770
Big blue eyes,
honest and direct.

01:17:25.810 --> 01:17:27.930
A little beauty mark
on her lip.

01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:31.410
Very small.
You only see it up close.

01:17:31.410 --> 01:17:36.770
When she smiles, you feel like--
I don't know.

01:17:37.930 --> 01:17:39.290
Love.

01:17:40.530 --> 01:17:42.770
Love.

01:17:46.650 --> 01:17:51.730
I know how it is.
The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:55.450
No matter what you do,
they'll never be your friends.

01:17:55.490 --> 01:17:57.050
There's nothing you can do.

01:17:57.210 --> 01:18:00.770
The bigger the man,
the deeper the footprint.

01:18:01.010 --> 01:18:06.290
And if he loves, he suffers,
knowing it's a dead-end street.

01:18:06.330 --> 01:18:08.930
That's nice,
what you just said.

01:18:08.930 --> 01:18:10.330
But sad.

01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:16.090
<i>I didn't say it. It was John Wayne
in The Shepherd of the Hills.</i>

01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:19.130
You old pirate!

01:18:59.090 --> 01:19:00.530
Hello, Elena.

01:19:01.450 --> 01:19:03.490
Why are you running?

01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:05.650
Because...

01:19:07.050 --> 01:19:09.730
I wanted to tell you--

01:19:10.410 --> 01:19:13.090
You remember when we--

01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:17.290
Nice day, isn't it?

01:19:21.690 --> 01:19:24.450
Yes, really nice.

01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:29.410
Excuse me, I have to go.
Bye.

01:19:33.290 --> 01:19:37.930
What a jerk. What a jerk!

01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:39.930
""Nice day, isn't it?''

01:19:40.090 --> 01:19:41.650
What an idiot!

01:19:51.650 --> 01:19:53.250
You may not believe me...

01:19:53.290 --> 01:19:55.450
but I'll play the leading male role
in the story of your life.

01:19:55.570 --> 01:20:00.490
Sure, I'm no Marlon Brando,
but take a good look at me.

01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:02.530
Am I really so ugly?

01:20:06.130 --> 01:20:08.090
So should I give it another try?

01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:10.530
Maybe this time I'll succeed.
What do you think?

01:20:18.770 --> 01:20:21.290
Hello, I'd like to speak
to Elena, please.

01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:23.210
<i>- This is she.
- Elena, is that you?</i>

01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:26.050
<i>- Yes.
- I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.</i>

01:20:26.170 --> 01:20:28.290
This is Salvatore.
Do you remember me?

01:20:29.210 --> 01:20:32.770
Listen, I know I make a fool
of myself every time we meet...

01:20:32.890 --> 01:20:36.410
but I swear, it's just that
you make me shy.

01:20:36.410 --> 01:20:39.210
But the truth is
I do nothing but think of you.

01:20:40.410 --> 01:20:43.170
Yes, Elena, you're my last thought
before I fall asleep...

01:20:43.330 --> 01:20:46.450
and the first when I wake up.
I dream of you every night.

01:20:46.450 --> 01:20:48.770
It doesn't sound romantic
over the phone, but I care about you--

01:20:48.890 --> 01:20:51.290
<i>If you don't stop calling,
I'll call the police.</i>

01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:52.810
Who's this?

01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:55.050
<i>I'm Elena's mother,you idiot.!</i>

01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:58.050
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Please believe me, I didn't know--

01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:01.290
Oh, shit!

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:03.650
I told you so.

01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:05.970
You thought I was joking.

01:21:06.050 --> 01:21:11.090
But take it from me:
The blue-eyed ones are the worst.

01:21:11.250 --> 01:21:14.730
But why? There must be a way
to make her understand.

01:21:14.810 --> 01:21:19.410
Don't even try. With feelings,
there's nothing to understand...

01:21:19.490 --> 01:21:21.810
and no way to explain.

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:25.170
You talk like you made the world!

01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:28.810
Toto, calm down.
Don't take it out on me.

01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:30.690
That's all I need.

01:21:31.890 --> 01:21:35.450
- Where'd you go?
- Get out of the way!

01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:37.210
Toto! Come back here!

01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:42.850
I can't walk on my own.

01:21:53.250 --> 01:21:56.210
You better watch your mouth!

01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:59.130
With all due respect
to the Lord...

01:21:59.210 --> 01:22:01.370
who made the world
in two or three days--

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:04.010
I'd have taken a bit longer...

01:22:04.090 --> 01:22:06.930
but in all modesty,
I would've done it better.

01:22:07.050 --> 01:22:10.930
Like I said:
You always have an answer.

01:22:12.850 --> 01:22:17.450
Just for you, Toto,
I'll tell you a story.

01:22:17.570 --> 01:22:19.410
Let's sit down a minute.

01:22:19.410 --> 01:22:21.850
These old bones of mine--

01:22:23.170 --> 01:22:25.050
Once upon a time...

01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:28.530
a king gave a feast...

01:22:28.650 --> 01:22:32.130
for the loveliest princesses
in the realm.

01:22:32.250 --> 01:22:36.250
Now, a soldier
who was standing guard...

01:22:36.370 --> 01:22:38.810
saw the king's daughter go by.

01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:41.330
She was the most beautiful of all...

01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:44.570
and he instantly fell in love.

01:22:44.650 --> 01:22:47.370
But what is a simple soldier...

01:22:47.490 --> 01:22:50.050
next to the daughter of a king?

01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:55.290
Well, at last he succeeded
in meeting her...

01:22:55.650 --> 01:22:59.250
and told her he could no longer
live without her.

01:22:59.450 --> 01:23:04.210
The princess was so taken
by the depth of his feeling...

01:23:04.210 --> 01:23:06.530
that she said to the soldier...

01:23:06.530 --> 01:23:09.490
""If you can wait...

01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:14.050
for 1 00 days and 1 00 nights
under my balcony...

01:23:14.170 --> 01:23:18.370
at the end
I shall be yours.''

01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:24.370
With that, the soldier went
and waited one day...

01:23:24.490 --> 01:23:27.290
two days, then ten,
then twenty.

01:23:27.290 --> 01:23:30.450
Each evening
the princess looked out...

01:23:30.530 --> 01:23:32.610
and he never moved!

01:23:32.610 --> 01:23:36.330
In rain, in wind, in snow,
he was always there.

01:23:36.370 --> 01:23:39.610
Birds shit on his head,
bees stung him...

01:23:39.690 --> 01:23:41.570
but he didn't budge.

01:23:43.130 --> 01:23:44.970
At the end...

01:23:46.170 --> 01:23:47.970
of 90 nights...

01:23:49.690 --> 01:23:51.610
he had become...

01:23:53.890 --> 01:23:56.930
all dry, all white.

01:23:56.970 --> 01:24:00.610
Tears streamed from his eyes.

01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:02.890
He couldn't hold them back.

01:24:02.890 --> 01:24:06.970
He didn't even have
the strength to sleep.

01:24:07.050 --> 01:24:12.090
All that time,
the princess watched him.

01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:16.810
At long last
it was the 99th night...

01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:19.650
and the soldier stood up...

01:24:19.730 --> 01:24:21.730
took his chair...

01:24:21.850 --> 01:24:23.330
and left.

01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:25.210
What? After all that?

01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:29.370
After all that.

01:24:29.370 --> 01:24:32.290
And don't ask what it means.
I don't know.

01:24:34.690 --> 01:24:37.690
If you understand it,
you tell me.

01:25:56.890 --> 01:25:58.930
Alfredo, what is it?

01:25:58.930 --> 01:26:01.170
I can't.
It's time for Mass.

01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:04.770
Father, I need you urgently...

01:26:04.810 --> 01:26:07.370
because I have doubts...

01:26:07.490 --> 01:26:09.610
terrible doubts
tormenting my soul.

01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:10.770
Your soul!

01:26:17.530 --> 01:26:18.570
Father, I've sinned.

01:26:18.730 --> 01:26:20.290
- We can discuss that later.
- But who--

01:26:20.410 --> 01:26:22.330
Stay there. Don't move.

01:26:22.450 --> 01:26:24.850
Just act normal.
It's Salvatore.

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:26.530
How'd you get in there?

01:26:29.890 --> 01:26:33.010
Alfredo, that's
a terrible thing to say.

01:26:33.090 --> 01:26:34.650
I know.

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:37.890
But take the miracle
of the loaves and fishes.

01:26:37.890 --> 01:26:40.290
What about it?

01:26:40.290 --> 01:26:44.250
I always wonder:
How is it possible?

01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:46.250
All hell broke loose.

01:26:46.330 --> 01:26:49.970
My mother told my father.
How could you mistake her for me?

01:26:50.450 --> 01:26:52.730
Forgive me, Elena.
I was a real fool.

01:26:52.810 --> 01:26:55.130
I had to talk to you.

01:27:04.370 --> 01:27:06.650
You're so beautiful, Elena.

01:27:06.730 --> 01:27:08.690
That's what I wanted to tell you.

01:27:08.770 --> 01:27:13.170
When we meet,
I can't say anything right...

01:27:13.290 --> 01:27:16.610
because you make me tremble.

01:27:16.650 --> 01:27:20.570
I don't know what others do
in a case like this.

01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:21.890
It's my first time.

01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:26.570
But I'm in love with you.

01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:28.930
Father, I have sinned.

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:30.970
I absolve you
in the name of the Father...

01:27:31.170 --> 01:27:32.530
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

01:27:32.610 --> 01:27:34.410
Go in peace.

01:27:38.730 --> 01:27:41.330
When you smile,
you're even prettier.

01:27:48.330 --> 01:27:52.930
Salvatore, you're very sweet,
and I like you very much...

01:27:52.930 --> 01:27:55.490
but I don't love you.

01:27:59.050 --> 01:28:01.290
I don't care.
I'll wait.

01:28:01.330 --> 01:28:03.010
What?

01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:05.610
Until you fall in love with me.

01:28:05.690 --> 01:28:07.570
Now listen.

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:12.850
Every night after work,
I'll come stand outside your house.

01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:14.850
And I'll wait. Every night.

01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:18.770
When you change your mind,
open your window.

01:28:18.810 --> 01:28:21.170
That's all.
I'll understand.

01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:22.570
You understand now?

01:28:22.570 --> 01:28:27.730
Yes, I finally see the light.

01:28:31.090 --> 01:28:33.850
Next time, don't talk heresy.

01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:36.850
You survived the fire
in the theater...

01:28:36.970 --> 01:28:41.250
but no one can save you
from eternal fire!

01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:09.530
What's keeping Toto?

01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:12.930
The theater's closed by now.

01:30:32.530 --> 01:30:36.610
<i>Fifteen seconds to the New Year.!</i>

01:30:37.330 --> 01:30:40.570
1 4, 1 3, 1 2--

01:30:55.130 --> 01:30:58.530
I wouldn't worry.
He must be with his friends.

01:30:58.690 --> 01:31:02.050
- Let's have a toast.
- Happy New Year!

01:31:04.850 --> 01:31:07.450
Happy New Year!

01:31:08.050 --> 01:31:10.850
- To Toto as well.
- To Toto!

01:33:21.450 --> 01:33:23.890
The movie's over!
Turn the lights on!

01:34:08.170 --> 01:34:10.610
This is just the test drive.

01:34:15.810 --> 01:34:17.810
How'll we get home?

01:34:22.770 --> 01:34:25.290
Oh, God, it's my father!

01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:28.570
Good evening, Mr. Mendola.

01:34:43.130 --> 01:34:45.090
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, good evening.</i>

01:34:45.130 --> 01:34:49.730
<i>The :Teatro della Fiera'"in Milan
presents Double Your Money...</i>

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.730
<i>hosted by Mike Bongiorno.</i>

01:34:58.450 --> 01:35:00.890
<i>What do you know?
I forgot my lines.</i>

01:35:01.810 --> 01:35:03.770
You're kidding me, right?

01:35:03.810 --> 01:35:06.450
How can you see this ""television''
without any film?

01:35:06.530 --> 01:35:09.090
- That's the way it works.
- With no film?

01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:13.690
And if you buy a television set,
you can watch it at home.

01:35:13.690 --> 01:35:15.890
That may be, but I don't like it.

01:35:16.290 --> 01:35:18.210
There's something fishy about it.

01:35:18.250 --> 01:35:19.850
<i>- Massa--?
- Macinaia.</i>

01:35:19.970 --> 01:35:21.850
<i>Massa Macinaia.</i>

01:35:22.050 --> 01:35:24.130
<i>It must be close to Massa Carrara.</i>

01:35:24.250 --> 01:35:26.170
<i>No. It's near Lucca.</i>

01:35:27.610 --> 01:35:30.210
Isn't this a marvelous invention?

01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:33.210
But how was I supposed to buy
the equipment without a mortgage?

01:35:33.530 --> 01:35:37.690
In this day and age,
one has to keep up with the times.

01:35:38.210 --> 01:35:41.250
It's a new machine
called a teleprojector.

01:35:50.490 --> 01:35:52.210
<i>What are you going to perform
this evening?</i>

01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:54.970
The Divine Comedy.

01:35:55.650 --> 01:35:58.370
Maybe your father
looks down on my job.

01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:00.650
Or the fact my family is poor.
Is that it?

01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:07.170
As soon as school is out,
we're going to Tuscany.

01:36:07.930 --> 01:36:10.450
If you come up there,
we can meet secretly.

01:36:10.930 --> 01:36:14.410
I have to work all summer.
What am I going to do without you?

01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:17.810
Don't worry.
I'll write you every day.

01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:21.490
I love you. The summer will end,
and I'll come back.

01:36:44.650 --> 01:36:47.970
""Summer Screenings Will Be Held
at the Arena Imperia''

01:36:59.530 --> 01:37:01.330
Standing room only!

01:37:01.890 --> 01:37:04.530
Get in for free,
but pay to get out!

01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:15.650
Come on in.
The show just started.

01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:17.650
Have your tickets ready.

01:37:48.730 --> 01:37:50.330
<i>Salvatore, my love...</i>

01:37:50.410 --> 01:37:52.290
<i>the days here drag on forever.</i>

01:37:52.330 --> 01:37:56.090
<i>I see your name everywhere."
in a book, a crossword puzzle...</i>

01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:57.890
<i>a newspaper.</i>

01:37:57.930 --> 01:37:59.810
<i>You're always before my eyes.</i>

01:37:59.890 --> 01:38:02.250
<i>Today, alas, I have bad news.</i>

01:38:02.330 --> 01:38:05.770
<i>In October we're moving to Palermo,
where I'll go to the university.</i>

01:38:05.850 --> 01:38:08.330
<i>So we won't see each other
every day.</i>

01:38:08.330 --> 01:38:11.490
<i>But don't worry.
Whenever I can get away...</i>

01:38:11.490 --> 01:38:14.570
<i>I'll come to you
at the Paradiso.</i>

01:38:43.090 --> 01:38:45.970
I caught an octopus!

01:39:04.090 --> 01:39:06.090
There's a letter for you!

01:39:06.490 --> 01:39:09.570
One a day. Here you go.

01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:12.970
- You making fun of me?
- Of course!

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:27.370
<i>I'm blind.!</i>

01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:55.850
<i>By God's might, by man's actions.!
Rise up.!</i>

01:40:21.730 --> 01:40:25.050
When will this rotten summer end?

01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:28.370
In a film, it'd already be over.

01:40:28.450 --> 01:40:32.090
Fade-out, cut to storm.
Wouldn't that be great?

01:40:45.730 --> 01:40:49.130
<i>Tell them I am Ulysses.!</i>

01:40:59.730 --> 01:41:01.770
Elena! But when--

01:41:01.810 --> 01:41:03.610
I got back today.

01:41:03.610 --> 01:41:06.570
You can't imagine the excuses
I made up to come here.

01:41:38.250 --> 01:41:41.250
You still can't beat Sophia Loren...

01:41:41.330 --> 01:41:44.450
with those long legs
and ample breasts.

01:41:44.530 --> 01:41:47.530
- Kind of like Lana Turner?
- Don Ciccio?

01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:50.130
This is for Toto.

01:41:50.210 --> 01:41:52.730
- You give it to him.
- What is it?

01:41:54.130 --> 01:41:57.330
Oh, my God!
What am I going to do now?

01:42:02.370 --> 01:42:04.330
What did they say?

01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:08.450
As a war orphan, I don't fall
under the mandatory draft.

01:42:08.490 --> 01:42:11.250
But there's nothing to be done.
They've made a clerical error.

01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:13.530
I leave for Rome on Friday.

01:42:13.650 --> 01:42:16.090
They said they'd discharge me
after ten days.

01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:18.810
- Come.
- No, Salvatore. You'd better go.

01:42:18.970 --> 01:42:20.570
My father's here.

01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:24.410
Good. Finally we can talk.
This time I'll make him see reason.

01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:28.610
I'm afraid not, Salvatore.
He has other plans for me.

01:42:29.770 --> 01:42:31.210
Who?

01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:33.490
The son of one
of his business partners.

01:42:33.490 --> 01:42:35.610
Don't look so sad.
We'll talk about it later.

01:42:35.730 --> 01:42:37.730
Wait for me Thursday
at the Paradiso.

01:42:37.730 --> 01:42:40.930
I'll be on the 5:00 bus.
I love you.

01:42:58.410 --> 01:42:59.970
""Thursday''

01:43:04.570 --> 01:43:05.610
""Today''

01:43:18.570 --> 01:43:22.330
This film is too highbrow for us.
One day is more than enough.

01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:27.170
Load the reels for tomorrow,
ready for the new guy.

01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:28.730
All right.

01:43:29.690 --> 01:43:32.370
Hey, cheer up!

01:43:32.490 --> 01:43:34.890
I'll wait for you.
Don't worry.

01:43:34.930 --> 01:43:36.770
The job'll still be here.

01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:38.450
I'll wait, you hear?

01:43:38.610 --> 01:43:39.850
Don't look so gloomy.

01:43:39.850 --> 01:43:41.810
Come on, now!

01:44:41.970 --> 01:44:44.130
You weren't expecting me,
were you?

01:44:44.770 --> 01:44:47.930
No, Alfredo.
I was coming to help you.

01:44:48.010 --> 01:44:50.450
No, you were expecting her.

01:44:51.450 --> 01:44:53.450
It's no fun to wait alone.

01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:55.850
It's easier
if you have company, right?

01:44:57.050 --> 01:44:58.850
Would you rather I left?

01:44:58.970 --> 01:45:02.810
No, don't go.
Listen, I need your help.

01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:29.250
How did he talk me into this?

01:45:55.050 --> 01:45:56.090
Open up!

01:45:57.730 --> 01:45:59.330
Open the door!

01:46:34.690 --> 01:46:36.250
I don't like it!

01:47:00.330 --> 01:47:02.330
- I'm back.
- What took you so long?

01:47:03.530 --> 01:47:05.290
- I'm here now.
- Where did you go?

01:47:06.010 --> 01:47:08.930
Calm down. It's all right.
Sit down.

01:47:13.810 --> 01:47:15.690
Did she come?

01:47:16.210 --> 01:47:18.130
No, no one came.

01:47:37.730 --> 01:47:41.370
Radioman Di Vita, 3rd Battalion,
9th Company, sir!

01:47:47.930 --> 01:47:50.370
<i>Colonel, I'd like to know
when I'll be discharged.</i>

01:47:50.490 --> 01:47:53.250
<i>As yet we have received
no such order. You may go.</i>

01:48:00.330 --> 01:48:02.850
They transferred her father?
It can't be!

01:48:02.970 --> 01:48:05.330
And no one knows where?

01:48:05.370 --> 01:48:08.450
Screw you if you won't tell me!
Asshole son of a bitch!

01:48:30.250 --> 01:48:32.370
Colonel, I was only supposed
to be here for ten days.

01:48:32.410 --> 01:48:34.650
It's been almost a year
and I haven't been home once.

01:48:34.770 --> 01:48:37.130
I demand to be sent home
on leave!

01:49:00.370 --> 01:49:03.890
Di Vita, get ready.
Your discharge came through.

01:50:38.490 --> 01:50:40.930
You're thinner.

01:50:40.930 --> 01:50:43.530
I can tell you've been unhappy.

01:50:43.610 --> 01:50:45.970
They tell me you never go out...

01:50:45.970 --> 01:50:47.890
and you never talk to anybody.

01:50:47.890 --> 01:50:49.570
Why?

01:50:50.250 --> 01:50:52.090
You know how it is.

01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:56.130
Sooner or later a time comes...

01:50:56.210 --> 01:51:01.250
when it's all the same
whether you talk or not.

01:51:02.970 --> 01:51:05.490
So you might as well shut up.

01:51:12.010 --> 01:51:13.810
It's hot in here.

01:51:14.970 --> 01:51:16.570
Take me to the sea.

01:51:16.730 --> 01:51:20.330
At a party, a lieutenant
pinches this girl's ass.

01:51:20.410 --> 01:51:24.170
She turns around.
It's the colonel's daughter.

01:51:24.250 --> 01:51:25.890
Terrified, the lieutenant says...

01:51:25.970 --> 01:51:30.970
""If your heart is as hard
as what I just felt, I'm a dead man.''

01:51:36.610 --> 01:51:38.530
You haven't seen her?

01:51:42.090 --> 01:51:44.370
And no one knows where she is.

01:51:46.090 --> 01:51:49.930
That's probably how
it was meant to be.

01:51:50.010 --> 01:51:54.490
Each of us has his own destiny.

01:51:54.570 --> 01:51:58.210
What do you plan to do now?

01:52:08.370 --> 01:52:09.970
I've got another one.

01:52:10.410 --> 01:52:12.650
The captain says to the sergeant...

01:52:13.050 --> 01:52:15.010
""Do you remember...

01:52:15.610 --> 01:52:17.530
when there was a windmill there?''

01:52:18.370 --> 01:52:20.410
""Yes, Captain, I remember it well.''

01:52:21.530 --> 01:52:23.610
The windmill is gone now...

01:52:23.610 --> 01:52:25.810
but the wind is still there.''

01:52:34.410 --> 01:52:37.090
Do you remember the story
about the soldier and the princess?

01:52:49.290 --> 01:52:52.090
Now I know why the soldier left
after all that time.

01:52:57.810 --> 01:53:00.610
One more night
and the princess would be his.

01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:04.930
But she might have broken
her promise...

01:53:05.090 --> 01:53:07.210
and that would have been terrible.

01:53:07.330 --> 01:53:09.610
It would have killed him.

01:53:09.610 --> 01:53:12.570
This way, at least,
for 99 nights...

01:53:12.690 --> 01:53:15.610
he had lived with the illusion
that she was waiting for him.

01:53:17.490 --> 01:53:19.930
Do as the soldier did, Toto.

01:53:20.010 --> 01:53:21.770
Get out of here.

01:53:22.250 --> 01:53:24.730
This land is cursed.

01:53:24.810 --> 01:53:27.690
Living here day after day...

01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:31.210
you think
it's the center of the world.

01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:34.970
You believe nothing
will ever change.

01:53:35.010 --> 01:53:38.610
Then you leave
for a year or two.

01:53:38.610 --> 01:53:41.210
When you come back,
everything's changed.

01:53:41.210 --> 01:53:43.930
The thread's broken.

01:53:43.930 --> 01:53:46.610
What you came to find isn't there.

01:53:46.690 --> 01:53:48.570
What was yours is gone.

01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:52.330
You have to go away
for a long time...

01:53:52.370 --> 01:53:54.490
many years...

01:53:54.690 --> 01:53:59.490
before you can come back
and find your people.

01:53:59.570 --> 01:54:02.890
The land where you were born.

01:54:02.890 --> 01:54:05.450
But not now.
It's not possible.

01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:08.050
Right now,
you're more blind than I am.

01:54:08.210 --> 01:54:11.890
Who said that? Gary Cooper?
James Stewart? Henry Fonda?

01:54:12.010 --> 01:54:13.850
No, Toto.

01:54:16.050 --> 01:54:18.410
Nobody said it.

01:54:19.810 --> 01:54:22.010
This time it's all me.

01:54:23.170 --> 01:54:26.810
Life isn't like in the movies.

01:54:26.890 --> 01:54:29.010
Life...

01:54:29.130 --> 01:54:31.010
is much harder.

01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:34.530
Get out of here!

01:54:34.690 --> 01:54:36.530
Go back to Rome.

01:54:36.690 --> 01:54:40.130
You're young,
and the world is yours.

01:54:40.890 --> 01:54:43.010
And I'm old.

01:54:43.810 --> 01:54:46.930
I don't want to hear you
talk anymore.

01:54:46.930 --> 01:54:49.290
I want to hear others
talking about you.

01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:19.650
Don't come back.

01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:22.770
Don't think about us.

01:56:22.810 --> 01:56:25.610
Don't look back. Don't write.

01:56:25.690 --> 01:56:31.010
Don't give in to nostalgia.
Forget us all.

01:56:31.050 --> 01:56:34.290
If you do and you come back,
don't come see me.

01:56:34.330 --> 01:56:37.890
I won't let you in my house.
Understand?

01:56:44.690 --> 01:56:46.450
Thank you.

01:56:47.490 --> 01:56:49.770
For everything you've done for me.

01:56:52.370 --> 01:56:55.250
Whatever you end up doing,
love it.

01:56:56.810 --> 01:56:59.250
The way you loved
the projection booth...

01:57:00.730 --> 01:57:03.090
when you were a little squirt.

01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:15.250
He's gone.
Toto! Good-bye!

01:57:21.650 --> 01:57:24.050
I got here too late.
What a shame!

01:58:20.850 --> 01:58:23.890
It's Toto. I knew it.

01:58:40.490 --> 01:58:42.090
- Toto.
- How are you?

01:58:54.530 --> 01:58:59.490
Your sister will be so glad
to see you. And the children--

01:58:59.490 --> 01:59:02.490
You won't recognize them,
they've grown so much.

01:59:02.490 --> 01:59:04.570
They always write to say
they want to come and visit.

01:59:04.610 --> 01:59:07.410
See how nice the house is?

01:59:07.410 --> 01:59:12.410
We had the whole thing redone,
all thanks to you.

01:59:12.530 --> 01:59:16.130
I have a surprise for you.
Come.

01:59:16.130 --> 01:59:18.810
Are you tired?

01:59:18.810 --> 01:59:21.730
You have time to rest
before the funeral.

01:59:21.770 --> 01:59:25.210
No, Mama,
it's only an hour by plane.

01:59:25.290 --> 01:59:28.970
You shouldn't have said that
after all these years.

01:59:28.970 --> 01:59:33.050
Come. I put all your things in here.

02:01:15.930 --> 02:01:18.770
He must be glad you came, Toto.

02:01:20.770 --> 02:01:23.610
He always talked about you.
Always.

02:01:25.130 --> 02:01:27.370
Right up to the end.

02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:34.570
He really loved you.

02:01:48.010 --> 02:01:50.330
He left something for you.

02:01:51.650 --> 02:01:53.610
Before you leave...

02:01:53.690 --> 02:01:55.530
come see me.

02:03:36.610 --> 02:03:39.170
When did you close it down?

02:03:39.210 --> 02:03:43.610
Six years ago in May.
Nobody came anymore.

02:03:43.690 --> 02:03:48.450
You know better than I, Mr. Di Vita--
the economy, TV, videos.

02:03:48.570 --> 02:03:52.730
The old movie business
is just a memory.

02:03:53.450 --> 02:03:57.450
The city bought the site
for a parking lot.

02:03:57.530 --> 02:04:01.210
They're demolishing it Saturday.
It's too bad.

02:04:03.250 --> 02:04:05.090
What's this ""Mr. Di Vita''?

02:04:06.170 --> 02:04:08.130
You used to order me around.

02:04:08.250 --> 02:04:12.970
Now that you're a big shot,
it's a little different.

02:04:13.010 --> 02:04:16.250
But if you insist, Toto.

02:04:19.370 --> 02:04:20.770
Excuse me.

02:04:25.810 --> 02:04:28.690
Who would've believed it?
Little Toto.

02:05:00.370 --> 02:05:03.850
Uncle, next time Grandma goes
to Rome, I want to go too.

02:05:03.930 --> 02:05:06.130
I want to see what you do
when you work.

02:05:06.650 --> 02:05:09.330
Fine, but I have to tell you,
there's not much to see.

02:05:09.770 --> 02:05:12.210
I sell a lot of smoke
and very little substance.

02:05:14.170 --> 02:05:15.610
Watch out, Salvatore.

02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:17.810
Don't let them take
advantage of you.

02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:21.250
These two will eat you alive.

02:05:23.090 --> 02:05:24.770
Uncle, are you leaving tomorrow?

02:05:27.210 --> 02:05:30.450
I don't know.
I don't know, Filippo.

02:05:31.450 --> 02:05:33.090
I really don't know.

02:05:51.970 --> 02:05:53.370
It must be for you.

02:05:53.450 --> 02:05:55.930
They've been calling all afternoon.

02:05:56.050 --> 02:05:58.250
They want to know
whether you're leaving tonight...

02:05:58.650 --> 02:05:59.810
or tomorrow.

02:06:09.210 --> 02:06:10.610
Go on in.

02:09:10.450 --> 02:09:12.210
A double whiskey, please.

02:09:15.170 --> 02:09:16.770
Do you think that's him?

02:09:22.370 --> 02:09:24.930
Excuse me, are you Dr. Lenera?

02:09:26.330 --> 02:09:28.130
I'm a big fan.

02:09:32.770 --> 02:09:34.530
Thank you.

02:10:37.010 --> 02:10:38.770
- Miss?
- Yes?

02:10:46.290 --> 02:10:49.370
I'm sorry.
I mistook you for someone else.

02:12:05.810 --> 02:12:07.930
I always have to call you.

02:12:08.090 --> 02:12:10.010
Why right now?

02:12:10.090 --> 02:12:13.450
You were supposed
to pick me up at noon.

02:12:13.890 --> 02:12:16.810
Forget it. I'm not coming.

02:12:16.810 --> 02:12:19.450
You know what?
I'll go by myself.

02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:06.810
What are you thinking?

02:13:10.530 --> 02:13:14.930
I was thinking that you and I
have never spoken, Mama.

02:13:17.930 --> 02:13:21.250
When I was little,
I saw you...

02:13:22.730 --> 02:13:24.730
as an old woman already.

02:13:25.890 --> 02:13:28.050
Maybe it's the same for all children.
Who knows?

02:13:37.810 --> 02:13:40.130
Only now do I realize...

02:13:41.650 --> 02:13:43.690
that you were young...

02:13:44.370 --> 02:13:46.050
and beautiful.

02:13:47.170 --> 02:13:49.490
You had your whole life
ahead of you.

02:13:51.330 --> 02:13:55.330
How have you managed
to live alone all this time...

02:13:56.650 --> 02:13:58.930
with no one to think of you?

02:14:00.330 --> 02:14:02.090
You could have remarried.

02:14:03.290 --> 02:14:05.010
Why not?

02:14:07.170 --> 02:14:10.250
It's possible that back then
I wouldn't have understood.

02:14:11.050 --> 02:14:13.770
But eventually I would have.

02:14:15.210 --> 02:14:18.370
I never had anyone,
if that's what you're thinking.

02:14:19.010 --> 02:14:21.090
It was my choice not to.

02:14:21.170 --> 02:14:24.330
I remained faithful
first to your father...

02:14:24.370 --> 02:14:26.690
and later to you and Lia.

02:14:27.530 --> 02:14:30.570
That's the way I am.
I can't help it.

02:14:31.290 --> 02:14:34.130
And you're a lot like me.

02:14:34.170 --> 02:14:36.570
You're far too attached
to your things.

02:14:37.490 --> 02:14:40.450
I don't know
if it's a good thing.

02:14:40.770 --> 02:14:44.650
Loyalty is hard.

02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:47.810
If you're loyal,
you're forever alone.

02:14:54.850 --> 02:14:56.450
I shouldn't have called you.

02:14:58.690 --> 02:15:00.970
It's not your fault, Mama.

02:15:01.250 --> 02:15:05.690
It's just that I've always been
afraid to come back.

02:15:06.890 --> 02:15:11.690
And now, after all these years,
I thought I was stronger...

02:15:12.650 --> 02:15:14.890
that I'd forgotten
a lot of things.

02:15:15.770 --> 02:15:18.290
But in fact...

02:15:19.210 --> 02:15:21.490
I find I'm right back
where I was...

02:15:21.690 --> 02:15:24.250
as if I'd never been away.

02:15:26.210 --> 02:15:29.010
And yet I look at Lia
and feel that I don't even know her.

02:15:32.810 --> 02:15:34.770
And you, Mama...

02:15:36.010 --> 02:15:37.770
I deserted you.

02:15:38.930 --> 02:15:40.930
Ran out on you like a bandit...

02:15:41.050 --> 02:15:43.050
without any explanation.

02:15:43.130 --> 02:15:44.770
I never asked for any.

02:15:44.890 --> 02:15:47.290
You don't have to explain
anything to me.

02:15:47.290 --> 02:15:51.650
I always thought you did
what was right. Why dwell on it?

02:15:53.170 --> 02:15:55.170
Only one thing caused me pain.

02:15:55.210 --> 02:15:59.770
When I used to bolt
the door at night...

02:15:59.850 --> 02:16:01.610
before going to bed--

02:16:03.250 --> 02:16:05.370
You never used to do that.

02:16:07.010 --> 02:16:10.290
When you worked nights
at the theater...

02:16:10.410 --> 02:16:15.130
I couldn't fall asleep
until you came home.

02:16:16.410 --> 02:16:19.170
When you finally came in...

02:16:19.850 --> 02:16:22.170
I'd pretend to be asleep.

02:16:22.410 --> 02:16:25.130
But I'd hear you
moving around the house.

02:16:25.130 --> 02:16:27.690
Then, when you'd fall asleep...

02:16:27.690 --> 02:16:32.010
I'd get up and bolt the door.

02:16:33.809 --> 02:16:37.650
After you left...

02:16:38.049 --> 02:16:40.450
every time I did it...

02:16:40.610 --> 02:16:43.530
it felt as if I were leaving
someone outside the door.

02:16:45.450 --> 02:16:47.049
Far away.

02:16:48.290 --> 02:16:50.410
You were right to leave.

02:16:50.410 --> 02:16:53.209
You did what you wanted to do.

02:16:55.410 --> 02:16:59.370
Every time I call you,
a different woman answers.

02:16:59.370 --> 02:17:02.209
I pretend to recognize them...

02:17:02.290 --> 02:17:06.209
to save them the embarrassment
of an introduction.

02:17:06.889 --> 02:17:10.730
I'm sure they must think
I'm a crazy old woman.

02:17:12.850 --> 02:17:16.490
But I never heard
in any of their voices...

02:17:16.570 --> 02:17:18.570
that they really loved you.

02:17:18.690 --> 02:17:20.530
I would've known.

02:17:20.570 --> 02:17:23.049
All the same, I'd have liked...

02:17:23.049 --> 02:17:27.370
to see you settled down...

02:17:27.370 --> 02:17:29.170
in love with someone.

02:17:30.450 --> 02:17:32.610
But your life is there.

02:17:32.650 --> 02:17:35.610
Here there are only ghosts.

02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:37.330
Let go, Toto.

02:18:38.809 --> 02:18:40.370
Boccia!

02:18:58.530 --> 02:19:00.290
<i>Hello.</i>

02:19:46.129 --> 02:19:48.049
<i>Hello. Who is it?</i>

02:19:51.730 --> 02:19:54.170
I'd like to speak
to Elena, please.

02:19:54.170 --> 02:19:56.210
<i>Speaking.</i>

02:19:56.610 --> 02:19:58.410
<i>Who is it?</i>

02:20:00.530 --> 02:20:02.290
Salvatore.

02:20:04.850 --> 02:20:08.970
<i>Salvatore... who?</i>

02:20:11.970 --> 02:20:15.330
Di Vita. This is Salvatore Di Vita.

02:20:17.890 --> 02:20:19.450
Do you remember?

02:20:20.650 --> 02:20:23.090
I'm across the street
from your house.

02:20:23.490 --> 02:20:25.450
Right here, Elena.

02:20:36.970 --> 02:20:38.970
<i>Of course I remember.</i>

02:20:42.970 --> 02:20:45.050
I'd like to see you, Elena.

02:20:45.530 --> 02:20:47.330
Let's meet.

02:20:48.490 --> 02:20:50.730
<i>It was so long ago.</i>

02:20:51.250 --> 02:20:53.250
<i>Why should we meet?</i>

02:20:54.330 --> 02:20:56.090
<i>What good would it do?</i>

02:20:56.850 --> 02:20:58.690
Please, don't say no.

02:20:59.690 --> 02:21:03.010
<i>I'm old, Salvatore, and so are you.</i>

02:21:03.690 --> 02:21:05.610
<i>It's better
not to see each other.</i>

02:21:07.010 --> 02:21:09.130
<i>Good-bye.</i>

02:23:11.690 --> 02:23:13.210
How did you know I'd be here?

02:23:15.170 --> 02:23:18.770
I don't know how long it's been,
but there are things I remember.

02:23:20.250 --> 02:23:22.690
There weren't many places
to choose from.

02:23:25.690 --> 02:23:27.730
I looked for you.

02:23:45.570 --> 02:23:47.610
You're still beautiful.

02:23:50.770 --> 02:23:54.210
What are you talking about?
I'm old.

02:23:59.130 --> 02:24:01.490
Please don't look at me that way.

02:24:05.130 --> 02:24:07.170
Why did you come back?

02:24:08.370 --> 02:24:10.290
Alfredo died.

02:24:10.970 --> 02:24:12.410
Do you remember him?

02:24:14.130 --> 02:24:16.050
Of course I remember him.

02:24:16.690 --> 02:24:18.290
I'm sorry.

02:24:20.770 --> 02:24:22.730
You loved him very much.

02:24:25.530 --> 02:24:27.530
I saw your daughter.

02:24:28.330 --> 02:24:30.330
She's very beautiful.

02:24:32.530 --> 02:24:34.530
I bet there are many Salvatores
running after her.

02:24:36.770 --> 02:24:38.090
A few.

02:24:39.810 --> 02:24:42.250
But there aren't many like you.

02:24:46.290 --> 02:24:49.570
I also have a son.
He's older.

02:24:52.330 --> 02:24:54.850
- And you?
- No children.

02:24:55.130 --> 02:24:57.050
I'm not married.

02:25:00.130 --> 02:25:01.330
Are you happy?

02:25:02.410 --> 02:25:03.970
All things considered, yes.

02:25:06.290 --> 02:25:09.330
Although it wasn't
what I dreamt of at the time.

02:25:12.010 --> 02:25:13.930
You know my husband, don't you?

02:25:17.370 --> 02:25:19.290
Sure I do. Boccia.
I remember him well.

02:25:21.650 --> 02:25:25.170
What does he do in life?

02:25:26.570 --> 02:25:27.970
He's in politics.

02:25:29.130 --> 02:25:31.010
He's a regional delegate.

02:25:33.370 --> 02:25:36.330
We met up again
at the University of Pisa.

02:25:38.970 --> 02:25:41.930
Why didn't you marry the man
your father had chosen?

02:25:41.930 --> 02:25:43.810
I didn't want to.

02:25:43.930 --> 02:25:45.450
And in the end, I won.

02:25:51.210 --> 02:25:53.690
Back then I was waiting for you.

02:25:59.690 --> 02:26:03.330
But I never forgot you. Ever.

02:26:04.010 --> 02:26:05.850
Neither did I.

02:26:07.610 --> 02:26:10.010
Even though you disappeared.

02:26:13.970 --> 02:26:16.410
But why talk about it now?

02:26:21.970 --> 02:26:24.770
We'll just end up looking pathetic
and ridiculous.

02:26:25.770 --> 02:26:27.010
Do you still live in Rome?

02:26:27.090 --> 02:26:29.010
What are you talking about?

02:26:30.210 --> 02:26:33.730
The last time we spoke, we made
a date to meet at the Paradiso.

02:26:33.730 --> 02:26:37.250
You never showed up!
You disappeared without a trace!

02:26:37.290 --> 02:26:40.890
How many years have gone by?
More than 30!

02:26:45.810 --> 02:26:49.690
I did show up for that date.

02:26:58.330 --> 02:27:00.610
But I was late.

02:27:02.170 --> 02:27:04.450
I had had a long fight
with my parents.

02:27:07.010 --> 02:27:10.690
I had tried to convince them
that they couldn't separate us.

02:27:12.730 --> 02:27:14.650
But it was no use.

02:27:16.930 --> 02:27:18.690
They had decided...

02:27:19.850 --> 02:27:22.810
to leave Sicily once and for all.

02:27:24.970 --> 02:27:26.970
And we did.

02:27:28.610 --> 02:27:32.210
I didn't know what else to do,
what else to say.

02:27:34.170 --> 02:27:36.370
So I said yes.

02:27:36.970 --> 02:27:39.570
I would do as they wished.

02:27:41.450 --> 02:27:43.290
In exchange,
my father agreed...

02:27:43.290 --> 02:27:46.370
to let me see you one last time
to say good-bye.

02:27:48.290 --> 02:27:50.250
I was hoping...

02:27:51.210 --> 02:27:55.690
that we would use that time
to come up with a plan.

02:27:57.690 --> 02:27:59.850
I thought we would...

02:28:01.450 --> 02:28:03.410
run away together.

02:28:09.610 --> 02:28:11.650
My father drove me
to the theater.

02:28:11.770 --> 02:28:14.650
But Alfredo was in the booth,
not you.

02:28:17.690 --> 02:28:21.290
<i>I couldn't wait
for you to get back.</i>

02:28:23.570 --> 02:28:25.490
Hurry up, Elena.

02:28:25.610 --> 02:28:27.850
<i>So I explained
the situation to Alfredo.</i>

02:28:28.370 --> 02:28:30.730
<i>I told him I was leaving
that very night.</i>

02:28:30.850 --> 02:28:33.090
<i>I begged him
to tell you everything.</i>

02:28:34.850 --> 02:28:37.290
<i>He was very nice to me.</i>

02:28:38.810 --> 02:28:40.210
<i>He listened...</i>

02:28:41.050 --> 02:28:42.850
<i>very carefully.</i>

02:28:44.570 --> 02:28:46.570
Calm down.

02:28:46.770 --> 02:28:48.370
Don't cry.

02:28:49.690 --> 02:28:51.930
Now you listen to me.

02:28:52.330 --> 02:28:55.250
If you want me to tell Toto
all that you told me...

02:28:55.250 --> 02:28:57.250
I will.

02:28:57.290 --> 02:28:59.890
But if you want my advice...

02:28:59.890 --> 02:29:01.290
forget about him.

02:29:01.890 --> 02:29:04.650
It would be better for both of you
not to see each other.

02:29:05.450 --> 02:29:06.850
My child...

02:29:07.290 --> 02:29:11.490
fire always turns to ashes.

02:29:11.850 --> 02:29:15.330
Even the greatest love
comes to an end...

02:29:15.450 --> 02:29:19.810
and many other loves come
to take its place.

02:29:19.850 --> 02:29:22.490
But Toto has only one future.

02:29:23.210 --> 02:29:27.090
He can't see it now. I tell him,
but he doesn't believe me.

02:29:27.610 --> 02:29:29.730
He might even kill me.

02:29:31.690 --> 02:29:34.930
But you can understand it.

02:29:35.650 --> 02:29:37.650
<i>You must understand it.</i>

02:29:38.090 --> 02:29:39.610
Do it for him.

02:29:57.210 --> 02:30:00.170
It's a secret I would rather
not even have told you.

02:30:08.130 --> 02:30:10.130
Damn Alfredo!

02:30:12.610 --> 02:30:14.490
He fooled even you.

02:30:16.890 --> 02:30:19.490
I told him
I would take his advice.

02:30:19.650 --> 02:30:21.970
But before I left,
I wrote you that note.

02:30:33.490 --> 02:30:35.450
I was going down the stairs...

02:30:37.170 --> 02:30:40.290
<i>and I figured
that Alfredo couldn't see me.</i>

02:30:42.290 --> 02:30:44.170
<i>So I went back.</i>

02:30:46.330 --> 02:30:50.650
<i>He sat there motionless
at the projector.</i>

02:30:51.850 --> 02:30:54.650
<i>I took one of those slips of paper
off the wall...</i>

02:30:56.690 --> 02:30:59.090
<i>and wrote down the address
where you could find me...</i>

02:31:01.450 --> 02:31:03.730
<i>and that I would wait for you.</i>

02:31:07.610 --> 02:31:10.170
But you disappeared anyway.

02:31:20.050 --> 02:31:22.730
How I looked for you, Elena!

02:31:25.330 --> 02:31:27.250
You have no idea.

02:31:28.850 --> 02:31:31.130
I wrote, I called. Nothing.

02:31:33.290 --> 02:31:35.690
No one ever answered.

02:31:39.410 --> 02:31:41.770
That's why I ran away.

02:31:45.170 --> 02:31:47.370
And why I never came back here.

02:31:49.810 --> 02:31:51.730
But I dreamt of you for years.

02:32:03.490 --> 02:32:05.690
Even though years passed...

02:32:06.650 --> 02:32:09.090
in every woman I met...

02:32:09.650 --> 02:32:11.970
I sought only you.

02:32:13.450 --> 02:32:17.650
I've been very lucky in my career,
it's true.

02:32:21.490 --> 02:32:23.650
But something was always missing.

02:32:26.970 --> 02:32:29.250
I never would have dreamt that...

02:32:29.370 --> 02:32:32.130
everything would end...

02:32:33.130 --> 02:32:35.850
because of the man
who was a father to me.

02:32:37.450 --> 02:32:38.810
That madman.

02:32:39.690 --> 02:32:43.290
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning
I think I hated him too.

02:32:44.090 --> 02:32:45.930
But in time...

02:32:47.050 --> 02:32:49.290
I understood his words...

02:32:51.210 --> 02:32:53.450
and also your silence.

02:32:55.250 --> 02:32:57.010
I never found that note.

02:32:59.410 --> 02:33:01.410
I covered it up
with my own two hands.

02:33:03.570 --> 02:33:07.130
I didn't see it.
It's the only absurd explanation.

02:33:07.210 --> 02:33:10.010
What does it matter now
whether we find the reason?

02:33:11.490 --> 02:33:13.370
What's done is done.

02:33:14.650 --> 02:33:17.050
But Alfredo didn't betray you.

02:33:17.130 --> 02:33:19.690
He was the only one
who truly understood you.

02:33:20.730 --> 02:33:22.410
Salvatore...

02:33:22.930 --> 02:33:25.890
if you had chosen to stay with me,
you wouldn't have made your movies...

02:33:25.930 --> 02:33:28.090
and that would have been
a shame.

02:33:28.170 --> 02:33:30.570
They're wonderful.

02:33:30.690 --> 02:33:32.570
I've seen them all.

02:33:34.890 --> 02:33:37.450
But you never should have changed
your name.

02:33:39.050 --> 02:33:40.970
You should have kept your name.

02:33:41.930 --> 02:33:43.690
Salvatore Di Vita.

02:34:53.090 --> 02:34:55.850
These are the things
he left for you.

02:35:10.050 --> 02:35:15.010
When they showed your films
on television...

02:35:15.050 --> 02:35:16.650
he was happy.

02:35:18.330 --> 02:35:22.650
He'd sit in front of it
and forget all his troubles.

02:35:25.370 --> 02:35:28.890
He knew all the words by heart...

02:35:28.970 --> 02:35:32.450
and I would tell him
what I saw.

02:35:32.450 --> 02:35:35.090
And when the papers
talked about you...

02:35:35.250 --> 02:35:37.930
I'd have to read them to him
two or three times.

02:35:42.330 --> 02:35:46.570
- He never asked to see me?
- No, never.

02:35:48.530 --> 02:35:51.490
Once your mother said to him...

02:35:51.570 --> 02:35:54.690
that you'd surely come
if you wanted him to.

02:35:56.010 --> 02:35:58.610
He was furious and said...

02:35:58.690 --> 02:36:02.970
""No, Toto must never come back
to Giancaldo!''

02:36:05.810 --> 02:36:08.210
He didn't say it to be mean.

02:36:08.250 --> 02:36:10.250
He was a good man.

02:36:11.450 --> 02:36:15.290
Who knows what was going
through his head?

02:36:15.410 --> 02:36:19.330
Towards the end,
he started saying strange things.

02:36:21.970 --> 02:36:25.930
A moment before
he closed his eyes...

02:36:26.090 --> 02:36:30.130
he told your mother
she mustn't let you know.

02:36:43.450 --> 02:36:45.930
1 977, '7 8--

02:37:10.890 --> 02:37:12.810
<i>Moby Dick.</i>

02:37:15.650 --> 02:37:17.610
<i>Dreams in a Drawer.</i>

02:37:18.610 --> 02:37:20.210
<i>The Challenge.</i>

02:37:20.970 --> 02:37:22.730
<i>The Searchers.</i>

02:37:26.370 --> 02:37:28.330

02:37:44.290 --> 02:37:46.090
""Salvatore...

02:37:47.410 --> 02:37:49.090
forgive me.

02:37:50.650 --> 02:37:52.930
When I see you,
I'll explain what happened.

02:37:53.890 --> 02:37:57.170
It was terrible
not to find you here.

02:37:57.210 --> 02:38:02.970
I'm afraid I'll be leaving tonight
for Tuscany with my mother.

02:38:04.130 --> 02:38:05.690
We're moving there.

02:38:06.970 --> 02:38:10.690
But I love only you.

02:38:10.730 --> 02:38:13.890
I'll never be with another man.
I swear it.

02:38:15.890 --> 02:38:20.250
I'm leaving you the address
of a friend where you can write me.

02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:24.450
Don't give up on me.

02:38:27.010 --> 02:38:29.010
Sealed with a kiss...

02:38:30.490 --> 02:38:32.610
Your Elena.''

02:38:36.090 --> 02:38:38.010
<i>When are you leaving?</i>

02:38:39.650 --> 02:38:41.410
This afternoon.

02:38:42.730 --> 02:38:46.170
Elena, perhaps in the future
we could--

02:38:46.370 --> 02:38:49.170
No, Salvatore, there is no future.

02:38:49.530 --> 02:38:51.450
There is only the past.

02:38:52.930 --> 02:38:55.330
Even last night's encounter
was just a dream.

02:38:55.930 --> 02:38:57.930
A wonderful dream.

02:39:00.090 --> 02:39:02.530
When we were young,
we never did it.

02:39:03.530 --> 02:39:04.650
Do you remember?

02:39:07.650 --> 02:39:11.090
<i>Now that it has happened,
I can't imagine a better ending.</i>

02:39:17.730 --> 02:39:20.010
I'll never agree with you.

02:39:21.130 --> 02:39:22.770
Never.

02:41:01.490 --> 02:41:05.370
It's my square.
The square is mine.

02:41:29.010 --> 02:41:31.770
Check the leader.
Roll when you're ready.

02:41:31.770 --> 02:41:35.610
- I liked your film. It was terrific.
- Thanks.

02:41:36.970 --> 02:41:40.210
The distributor is moving up
the release date.

02:41:40.450 --> 02:41:42.650
The press conference
is this afternoon.

02:41:42.650 --> 02:41:45.250
The actors will be there,
as well as the producer.

02:41:45.250 --> 02:41:47.370
We just got official confirmation
of the award...

02:41:47.410 --> 02:41:49.810
but we've already received
loads of telegrams.

02:41:50.770 --> 02:41:52.610
Aren't you happy?

02:41:53.410 --> 02:41:56.130
Sure, fine.
We can discuss it later.
