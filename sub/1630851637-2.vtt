16:39.990 --> 16:41.966
Now I have Clinton as my model,

16:41.967 --> 16:45.503
and that makes me even
more excited about the challenge

16:45.504 --> 16:48.639
because now the work can
truly be represented the right way.

16:48.640 --> 16:50.308
Thank you, babe.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.788
- Oh, my God, I'm so
happy. Coral, you're a star.

16:53.789 --> 16:55.147
- Thank you, babe.
- You're welcome.

16:55.148 --> 16:57.249
- Hello.
- Hey.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.350
You know, unlike most
of the other designers,

16:59.351 --> 17:01.619
I actually kind of focus more
on apparel and streetwear.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.287
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

17:03.288 --> 17:06.258
<i>- And I do both men's,
women's and gender-fluid.</i>

17:06.259 --> 17:07.259
<i>So I call it the shacket.</i>

17:07.260 --> 17:09.260
- A shacket!
- A shacket, yeah.

17:09.261 --> 17:11.596
It's basically,
like, a luxe version

17:11.597 --> 17:15.133
of Kurt Cobain's flannel
shirt from the '90s.

17:15.134 --> 17:16.468
- Oh, cool!
- Yes.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.871
I wanted to
hand-embroider a saying

17:18.872 --> 17:21.409
on the back of the shacket:

17:21.410 --> 17:23.541
"There is only one
race, and that's mankind."

17:23.542 --> 17:25.277
- Mm-hmm.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.747
It's so interesting, the
colors that you picked.

17:28.748 --> 17:30.315
- How so?
- It's just--

17:30.316 --> 17:34.219
- And then this is the hoodie.
- It's very beige.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.899
- Yeah, but again, I
think it's all in the styling.

17:37.900 --> 17:40.598
I think plain doesn't
have to be boring.

17:40.599 --> 17:44.196
- It's going a little
old man here.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.663
I think you gotta really think

17:45.664 --> 17:50.235
about all the bold looks
that are about to happen.

17:50.236 --> 17:51.703
- And then there's mine
that's not interesting.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.272
- It's not that--no,
it's not not interesting

17:54.273 --> 17:56.141
'cause I actually
really like the concept.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.643
It's actually very
different than everyone's,

17:57.644 --> 17:59.377
which is really nice,

17:59.378 --> 18:03.159
but I don't want it to look,
like, bland and brown.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.650
- Yeah, no, for sure.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.685
But again, to me,
like, street style is--

18:11.290 --> 18:13.491
Like, I--
- What?

18:13.492 --> 18:15.126
- Nothing. I just--I, like--

18:15.127 --> 18:16.729
- Don't be emotional
about it. It's not--

18:16.730 --> 18:18.197
- No, I know.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.297
- 'Cause I don't
want you to feel--

18:19.298 --> 18:21.467
- That's, like, the biggest
insecurity coming here

18:21.468 --> 18:24.135
because I know my aesthetic,

18:24.136 --> 18:26.404
and it's not the
exciting art piece.

18:26.405 --> 18:27.772
- Right.
- It's not.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.419
- And that's okay.

18:29.420 --> 18:30.175
Calvin Klein built

18:30.176 --> 18:32.277
a multi-billion
dollar business on it.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.813
And I think you'll figure it
out once you get into this.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.316
I am excited to see.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.117
- Thanks.
- Good luck.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.520
- It's terrifying
to have someone

18:42.521 --> 18:48.559
that you admire be
like, "That sucks."

18:48.560 --> 18:50.629
- Well, you have a lot
to cut out, so hurry up.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.979
- Yeah, I feel that.
- Okay, great.

18:52.980 --> 18:53.599
- Thank you.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.736
<i>This is more mentally
and emotionally taxing</i>

18:57.737 --> 19:00.506

it was going to be.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.207
- All right, guys,
I will see you

19:02.208 --> 19:04.442
in a little bit for
a model fitting.

Meg.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.211
- Like, my clothes is
very, like, Asian-inspired.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.747
- Mm-hmm.

20:14.748 --> 20:16.781
- And my model is a white
boy. Do you want to switch?

20:16.782 --> 20:18.150
- I mean, I'm not
gonna promise anything.

20:18.151 --> 20:19.485

- Kenneth...
- No, no, no.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.392
- It has nothing to do
with me being comfortable.

20:26.393 --> 20:27.726
- I don't want
you to feel like--

20:27.727 --> 20:30.194
- I don't feel like anything.
I just want to see him first.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.462
I'm not gonna make
a decision blindly.

20:31.463 --> 20:33.231
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.799
- Like, it has nothing--
And I'm ----ing tired.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.701
Like--
- Yeah.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.135
- Like, I'm telling
you I'm willing...

20:37.136 --> 20:38.537
- It's just an option.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.771
- To talk to you...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.472
- About it, but I'm not making
a decision without seeing...

20:41.473 --> 20:42.607
- Okay.
- The model.

20:42.608 --> 20:44.442
- Thank you, Meg.
- You're welcome.

20:44.443 --> 20:48.681
I've already spent hours
patterning, cutting, draping,

20:48.682 --> 20:52.817
designing for an
Asian male model.

20:52.818 --> 20:57.655
So I literally have, like,
almost all the elements for us

20:57.656 --> 21:02.694
to put on your body, but
someone else wanted you.

21:02.695 --> 21:06.864
It's so important to me to
respect and acknowledge

21:06.865 --> 21:11.170
the fact that he wanted to
design for his own culture.

21:11.171 --> 21:12.671
Well, let's just go over there.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.506
I wouldn't look like
a woman of my word,

21:14.507 --> 21:17.209
and I would kind of
look like an asshole,

21:17.210 --> 21:18.844
or, like, that bitchy woman

21:18.845 --> 21:21.547
if I said "No, I don't
want to switch."

21:21.548 --> 21:24.850
I honestly don't want to
give you up, but Kenneth...

21:24.851 --> 21:25.751
- Yes.

21:25.752 --> 21:27.486
- If we're gonna do
this, let's do it now.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.820
- Okay.
- So--

21:28.821 --> 21:29.822
- Hello.
- Hi.

21:29.823 --> 21:32.919
- Yeah, so this is Trevor.
- Hi, how are you?

21:32.920 --> 21:33.460
- So this is Meg.

21:33.461 --> 21:35.861
So we're trying to see if--
How we can make it work--

21:35.862 --> 21:37.629
- No, we're not--
- Okay--

21:37.630 --> 21:41.232
- Don't put--no, he wants
my model because--

21:41.233 --> 21:42.867
- It's about, like,
representation.

21:42.868 --> 21:43.737
- Don't sugarcoat it.

21:43.738 --> 21:45.671
- Since this is
our first challenge,

21:45.672 --> 21:48.106
I wanted to be able
to show my work

21:48.107 --> 21:49.874
in a model that looks like me.

21:49.875 --> 21:52.544
It's nothing about
you. I know it's heavy.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.345
- Oh, no, I think
it's ----ing bullsh--

21:54.346 --> 21:55.480
That you're doing this now.

21:55.481 --> 21:56.882
- Okay, then you
don't have to do this.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.450
- Would you let me talk?
- Okay, yeah.

21:58.451 --> 22:02.548
- Because, like, I honestly
respect the race thing...

22:02.549 --> 22:03.355
- Yeah.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.223
- I will do it just
for that factor.

22:05.224 --> 22:08.427
I think we should have had
this discussion 16 hours ago.

22:08.428 --> 22:10.828
- Meg, we don't have to
make it be so awkward.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.464
If you don't feel comfortable,
we don't have to do this.

22:13.465 --> 22:15.401
- Stop talking. Let's go.

22:15.402 --> 22:17.469
We're wasting time.
- Okay, take these off?

22:17.470 --> 22:19.470
- Okay. Sorry.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.406
- It was so nice to meet you.

22:21.407 --> 22:23.508
- Hi, again. Let's do this.

22:23.509 --> 22:26.711
- Apparently I can only
design for white people.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.579
What's your name?
- Trevor.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.114
- Let's start there.

22:30.115 --> 22:32.284
And you're kind of a ginge, too.

22:32.285 --> 22:34.421
So it was not about
switching. I just--

22:36.890 --> 22:38.624
- What does it--the woman
can't say how she feels?

22:38.625 --> 22:39.924
She has to be a bitch?

22:39.925 --> 22:41.160
- We're getting
into the shady zone.

22:41.161 --> 22:42.361
- Sorry about that.

22:42.362 --> 22:43.595
But I just don't want
it to create an issue

22:43.596 --> 22:45.130
where, like--you know?

22:45.131 --> 22:46.864
- You can't be about it
when it's convenient for you.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.600
That's that fake
sh-- I don't like.

22:48.601 --> 22:49.934
- What was the inspiration here?

22:49.935 --> 22:52.537
- Like, the crazy rich
Asian, and then going

22:52.538 --> 22:55.507
to New York City,
living his best life.

22:55.508 --> 22:58.510
And that's basically
this thing is all about.

23:03.549 --> 23:04.950
- Was it-- was I
really that mean?

23:04.951 --> 23:06.785
- Girl, that was
fake as [bleep].

23:06.786 --> 23:08.187
I lost so much
respect for you for that.

23:08.188 --> 23:09.587
- Why? I said...

23:09.588 --> 23:10.788
- You got involved in
my business this morning.

23:10.789 --> 23:11.957
- That I would switch with him.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.624
- You made it
extremely comfortable.

23:13.625 --> 23:16.461
You talk, talk, talk, yap,
yap, yap, for the same sh--,

23:16.462 --> 23:17.829
and then you just
went and did it to him.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.498
And I lost respect
for you for that.

23:19.499 --> 23:20.531
- Okay.
- Keep working.

23:20.532 --> 23:21.600
I got work to do.

23:21.601 --> 23:22.602
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

23:23.970 --> 23:25.970
- Can I give you a hug, girl?
- You need a hug?

23:25.971 --> 23:27.772
- I do need a hug.
- I'll always hug you, baby.

23:27.773 --> 23:28.941
- Thank you.

23:28.942 --> 23:30.843
- And don't ever let people
treat you like that again.

23:30.844 --> 23:31.778
- I know.

23:31.779 --> 23:34.912
It's just that I don't
like confrontations.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.647
- I know you don't.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.983
- You know, and I
want to go to that level.

23:38.984 --> 23:41.488
- Well, I'll go there.
- Love you, girl.

23:42.489 --> 23:44.690
- Seriously?
- What did I do again?

23:44.691 --> 23:46.825
- Dude, I told you the
reason why I would do it

23:46.826 --> 23:48.993
was because the race
thing was important

23:48.994 --> 23:51.764
that you got to
represent who you were,

23:51.765 --> 23:53.731
and I just got called
fake as [bleep].

23:53.732 --> 23:55.668
And you said nothing.

23:55.669 --> 23:58.237
[bleep] you, dude. [bleep] you.

23:58.238 --> 24:00.838
[bleep] you.
- [gasps]

24:00.839 --> 24:02.740
- Like, I literally--
- She just said "[bleep] you."

24:02.741 --> 24:04.209
- You don't have
to change anything.

24:04.210 --> 24:05.943
- Yeah, she said "[bleep] you."
- It's okay, Meg.

24:05.944 --> 24:07.179
- No, you don't have
to change anything,

24:07.180 --> 24:08.479
and I did it for you,

24:08.480 --> 24:10.348
and you stood there
and let that happen,

24:10.349 --> 24:11.517
and you did nothing.

24:11.518 --> 24:13.818
- Meg--
- No, no!

24:13.819 --> 24:15.548
- Okay.
- You did nothing.

24:15.549 --> 24:16.423
- I guess she knows
who to chew out.

24:16.424 --> 24:18.578
<i>- I don't know
what just happened,</i>

24:18.579 --> 24:19.588
<i>but people are being fake,</i>

24:19.589 --> 24:20.692
<i>and they're showing
their fakeness.</i>

24:20.693 --> 24:23.630
And I'm the one who does
not deal with fake stuff.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.649
- And it's just not
going to happen.

24:25.650 --> 24:26.964
You see how this
morning she was all about,

24:26.965 --> 24:28.767
"Oh, you should
represent your culture."

24:28.768 --> 24:30.536
He realized this
at the last minute.

24:30.537 --> 24:31.937
He said, "You know
what? Can we trade?"

24:31.938 --> 24:33.729
- Hey, I'm right here!
- Girl, I don't want to--

24:33.730 --> 24:35.749
- I'm right here!
- I don't want to speak to you!

24:35.750 --> 24:36.842
- No, you're not
even a part of it!

24:36.843 --> 24:37.711
- I don't want to speak to you!
- You're not even a part of it!

24:37.712 --> 24:38.943
- I'm not--I am part of it...

43:24.503 --> 43:28.540
<i>It's looking very fresh and
looking different than others.</i>

43:28.541 --> 43:31.877
<i>I hope the judges can
see the dynamic, you know,</i>

43:31.878 --> 43:33.312
<i>the freedom in this look, like,</i>

43:33.313 --> 43:37.751
<i>how the fabrics is moving,
how the model is presenting it.</i>

43:46.626 --> 43:49.495
<i>- When I see the look
coming out of that runway,</i>

43:49.496 --> 43:50.796
<i>it's like, wow.</i>

43:50.797 --> 43:53.364
<i>I mean, it looks
so cool and fresh.</i>

43:53.365 --> 43:55.234
<i>I love this model.</i>

43:55.235 --> 43:58.972
<i>Totally goes with the
theme and the challenge.</i>

44:05.644 --> 44:06.944
<i>- I feel like my look is</i>

44:06.945 --> 44:10.499
<i>strong enough to
be one of the tops.</i>

44:10.500 --> 44:12.451
- Yes.
<i>- It seems club.</i>

44:12.452 --> 44:13.852
<i>It seems music video.</i>

44:13.853 --> 44:17.570
<i>It screams so much,
but it is streetwear.</i>

44:28.702 --> 44:31.270
<i>- I think my design
is the coolest.</i>

44:31.271 --> 44:33.805
<i>It's unusual. It's
different. It's innovative.</i>

44:33.806 --> 44:37.768
<i>It is a piece of streetwear
that I've never seen before.</i>

44:37.769 --> 44:38.510
[gasping]

44:38.511 --> 44:41.446
<i>I believe my look
surprised the judges.</i>

44:41.447 --> 44:44.482
<i>Through this design, I hope
they can receive the message</i>

44:44.483 --> 44:46.819
<i>that Anna is always delivering</i>

44:46.820 --> 44:49.655
<i>something differently
as a designer.</i>

45:00.329 --> 45:02.600
<i>- I think my look
looks really cool.</i>

45:02.601 --> 45:04.736
<i>You can see the macrame flow.</i>

45:04.737 --> 45:08.107
<i>I hope the judges see that</i>

45:08.108 --> 45:11.709
<i>I can do clean finish clothes.</i>

45:11.710 --> 45:15.181
<i>I think I have done enough
to stay in the competition.</i>

45:16.715 --> 45:19.519
- It's the perfect fit.
- Yes.

45:23.889 --> 45:27.125
<i>- This Martian galactic
tribal streetwear look</i>

45:27.126 --> 45:28.893
<i>is honestly giving me life.</i>

45:28.894 --> 45:31.129
<i>I hope that the judges
see, with this look,</i>

45:31.130 --> 45:35.466
<i>that I have maybe an edgy style,</i>

45:35.467 --> 45:38.338
<i>but also a style that
is kind of refined.</i>

45:47.179 --> 45:51.884
<i>- I'm proud to do something
that's me as a designer.</i>

45:51.885 --> 45:55.354
<i>And I'm hoping that the judges
can react and respond to it,</i>

45:55.355 --> 45:57.321
<i>and I'm hoping that Wisdom Kaye</i>

45:57.322 --> 46:00.260
<i>see a little bit
of himself in that.</i>

46:08.367 --> 46:09.535
[cheers and applause]

46:09.536 --> 46:11.803
- Yeah!

46:11.804 --> 46:15.274
- Designers, a lot of you
have an individual style

46:15.275 --> 46:18.677
that clearly comes
out on the runway.

46:18.777 --> 46:26.777
- All of you, please
step up to the runway.

46:34.327 --> 46:37.462
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

46:37.463 --> 46:39.330
We've scored your designs,

46:39.331 --> 46:43.935
and we would like to
speak to Zayden, Aaron,

46:43.936 --> 46:46.605
Christina, Prajjé,

46:46.606 --> 46:49.774
Darren, Katie, and Kenneth.

46:49.775 --> 46:51.343
Everyone else, well done.

46:51.344 --> 46:53.745
You are in, and you
can leave the runway.

46:53.746 --> 46:55.114
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

47:00.530 --> 47:02.620
- Yes!
- We can drink.

47:02.621 --> 47:05.223
[indistinct chatter]

47:05.224 --> 47:10.261
- The seven of you had the
highest and lowest scores.

47:10.262 --> 47:14.633
One of you will be the winner,
and one of you will be out.

47:14.634 --> 47:17.935
- Oh, my God.
- Here we go.

47:17.936 --> 47:21.939
- Zayden, let's get
your model out here.

47:21.940 --> 47:23.375
Why don't you tell
us about your look?

47:23.376 --> 47:26.178
- I grew up in the streets.
I didn't have very much.

47:26.179 --> 47:29.488
But streetwear was just
the dopest thing to have.

47:29.489 --> 47:31.383
And to also intwine a
message and talk about

47:31.384 --> 47:32.484
"say their names" --because

47:32.485 --> 47:34.752
I wanted to take this
opportunity to show you guys

47:34.753 --> 47:38.578
a little bit of me and my DNA
and what I'm passionate about.

47:38.579 --> 47:41.959
- Zayden, we were all
really impressed by this look.

47:41.960 --> 47:45.129
You can really see how
original your ideas are.

47:45.130 --> 47:46.665
<i>Can you talk to me
about the pants a little bit?</i>

47:46.666 --> 47:49.435
- I just wanted to make
some oversized joggers,

47:49.436 --> 47:51.602
and kind of have, like,
some detailing work on it.

47:51.603 --> 47:53.538
Because, you know,
joggers can be simple,

47:53.539 --> 47:55.374
but I wanted to kind
of match it with the top.

47:55.375 --> 47:57.542
- Yeah, I've never
seen a top like this.

47:57.543 --> 47:58.977
It's very cool.

47:58.978 --> 48:00.678
- I love the coat.

48:00.679 --> 48:02.147
I love the layers.

48:02.148 --> 48:04.850
Each and every one
can stand by itself.

48:04.851 --> 48:06.352
- Everything really
comes together,

48:06.353 --> 48:08.120
and you've expressed
this really powerful message

48:08.121 --> 48:09.620
through your clothing,
through your art.

48:09.621 --> 48:11.790
It's an amazing look. I
really--I really do like it.

48:11.791 --> 48:14.269
- Thank you.

48:17.300 --> 48:19.319
[voice cracking] This
means so much to me.

48:19.320 --> 48:20.933
Through trials and tribulations,

48:20.934 --> 48:22.468
I've just kept
fighting, you know?

48:22.469 --> 48:23.369
And I'm proud to be here,

48:23.370 --> 48:26.638
and I'm glad that you
see something in me.

48:26.639 --> 48:29.441
- Zayden, well done.
- Thank you, Zayden.

48:29.442 --> 48:32.444
Thank you, Kellen.

48:32.445 --> 48:35.480
Aaron, we'd like to
speak to you next.

48:39.585 --> 48:43.756
Aaron, congratulations.

48:43.757 --> 48:45.924
- Job well done.

48:45.925 --> 48:47.326
- Do you want to tell
us about your look?

48:47.327 --> 48:49.127
- So, I grew up
this little kid in, like,

48:49.128 --> 48:51.462
small town West Virginia.
And somewhere along the way,

48:51.463 --> 48:55.600
I came across this bright
yellow bomber jacket.

48:55.601 --> 48:58.337
I couldn't do this
without doing yellow.

48:58.338 --> 49:00.372
This jacket is reversible.

49:00.373 --> 49:03.241
- Can we see the
bomber the other way?

49:03.242 --> 49:05.478
- Yeah! Absolutely.

49:09.481 --> 49:10.783
- Love a twofer.
- Value.

49:10.784 --> 49:12.250
- Wow.
- We love a twofer.

49:12.251 --> 49:14.652
- Also, the pants, you
can wear as a straight leg.

49:14.653 --> 49:16.154
- Wow.
- This is amazing.

49:16.155 --> 49:17.488
- Those pants in particularly,

49:17.489 --> 49:19.892
I've never seen
anything like that before.

49:19.893 --> 49:21.694
This was probably
my favorite look.

49:21.695 --> 49:24.638
The proportions, the way
everything sits on each other,

49:24.639 --> 49:26.988
everything really
came together in this.

49:26.989 --> 49:28.339
- I agree. I want
the whole thing!

49:28.340 --> 49:30.268
I would buy every piece of this.

49:30.269 --> 49:32.738
I have chills, because it's
bringing me back to the '90s

49:32.739 --> 49:34.406
in the best way possible.

49:34.407 --> 49:37.176
- I was listening to
'90s music getting ready,

49:37.177 --> 49:39.788
so it really deeply spoke to me

49:39.789 --> 49:40.512
when this came down
the runway today.

49:40.513 --> 49:44.316
And two days to make that
jacket is pretty impressive.

49:44.317 --> 49:46.352
- I mean, you just killed it.
- Thank you.

49:46.353 --> 49:47.886
- Thank you, Aaron and Sara.

49:47.887 --> 49:49.288
- Good job.

49:49.289 --> 49:50.488
- Thank you.
- Good job.

49:50.489 --> 49:53.692
- Okay, Darren, tell
us about your look.

49:53.693 --> 49:56.618
- My whole look is a
little bit of a love letter

49:56.619 --> 49:59.988
to "baby Darren,"
'cause back in the day,

49:59.989 --> 50:02.767
he wanted to look
and feel like a rock star.

50:02.768 --> 50:05.104
- Darren, unfortunately,

50:05.105 --> 50:07.839
you were not one of
our favorites tonight.

50:07.840 --> 50:11.944
- Do you feel like this is a
really clear representation

50:11.945 --> 50:13.379
of who you are as a designer?

50:13.380 --> 50:15.980
- Yes.
- So you're proud of this look.

50:15.981 --> 50:17.383
- Yes.

50:17.384 --> 50:20.486
- It just feels like a
lot of different ideas

50:20.487 --> 50:24.899
that collectively maybe
look a little messy together.

50:24.900 --> 50:25.957
- Right.
<i>- I had a hard time</i>

50:25.958 --> 50:30.361
trying to pinpoint what was
different about each piece.

50:30.362 --> 50:33.564
I just personally did not
see an original point of view.

50:33.565 --> 50:37.602
- Streetwear is so
subjective. It is punk.

50:37.603 --> 50:39.337
I got it immediately.

50:39.338 --> 50:42.573
But it just doesn't
feel like the moment.

50:42.574 --> 50:46.345
- It's just not giving me
the streetwear aspect itself.

50:46.346 --> 50:49.147
But as a full
look, I do enjoy it.

50:49.148 --> 50:50.783
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Darren.

50:50.784 --> 50:53.252
Thank you, Jimmy.

50:53.253 --> 50:56.587
All right, Prajjé, you're up.

50:56.588 --> 50:58.556
Why don't you tell us a
little bit about your look?

50:58.557 --> 51:01.392
- I wanted to take a step
back into the Haitian history.

51:01.393 --> 51:02.928
<i>1804, that's the year</i>

51:02.929 --> 51:05.296
<i>Haiti got their
independence from slavery.</i>

51:05.297 --> 51:07.933
It's also to put it in reference
and what's happening,

51:07.934 --> 51:11.709
as specifically in my own
issues, as African-American.

51:11.710 --> 51:15.749
And in the back, I went in
and painted Erzulie D'en Tort.

51:15.750 --> 51:17.509
She's the Goddess
of Motherhood, labor,

51:17.510 --> 51:21.212
and when her kids
hurt, she cries blood,

51:21.213 --> 51:22.613
and she's angry,

51:22.614 --> 51:24.817
so that's why she looks
a little mean back there.

51:24.818 --> 51:28.252
- You had one of our favorite
looks of the night, Prajjé.

51:28.253 --> 51:29.888
- There's so much here.

51:29.889 --> 51:35.948
Your own culture, your own
meanings from that 1804,

51:35.949 --> 51:38.629
the fact that you
incorporated your art.

51:38.630 --> 51:42.533
We tend to forget, but
Warhol, Basquiat--those were,

51:42.534 --> 51:45.937
like, the grandaddies
of streetwear, right?

51:45.938 --> 51:51.109
There was so much
expression of you in this outfit.

51:51.110 --> 51:52.544
It really moved me.

51:52.545 --> 51:53.812
- Thank you.
- You're designing

51:53.813 --> 51:58.951
for a generation that wants
to wear its values on its back.

51:58.952 --> 52:02.654
And you did that so well.

52:02.655 --> 52:04.156
- The craftsmanship
on that is amazing.

52:04.157 --> 52:07.493
- This look has been
done so intelligently,

52:07.494 --> 52:11.863
and I'm not wearing a cool
hat, but my hat's off to you.

52:11.864 --> 52:14.667
- Thank you.
- Thank you both.

52:14.668 --> 52:18.703
Katie, want to talk to you next.

52:18.704 --> 52:21.906
Can you tell us
a little bit about it?

52:21.907 --> 52:25.410
- I am a textile
designer. I'm self-taught.

52:25.411 --> 52:28.680
I tend to do things that
are a little more feminine.

52:28.681 --> 52:32.216
And I was trying to
merge my aesthetic

52:32.217 --> 52:33.451
with a streetwear vibe.

52:33.452 --> 52:34.687
- Unfortunately, you have

52:34.688 --> 52:38.223
one of our least favorite
looks from tonight.

52:38.224 --> 52:42.227
So, it's a--like, a
jumpsuit with strings?

52:42.228 --> 52:43.928
- It's, like, an
overall-type thing.

52:43.929 --> 52:46.431
- Oh, so that is one
piece that you're holding.

52:46.432 --> 52:47.700
That's, like, a jacket.

52:47.701 --> 52:49.401
- This is a jacket. Yeah.

52:49.402 --> 52:51.437
- I couldn't really tell if
it was a shirt or a jacket,

52:51.438 --> 52:52.738
or what was going on.

52:52.739 --> 52:54.105
- I know, I should
have her remove it

52:54.106 --> 52:55.640
at the end of the runway.

52:55.641 --> 52:59.111
- The issue for me was
that it lacked a modernity,

52:59.112 --> 53:01.279
whereas, I think, every
time I've seen you,

53:01.280 --> 53:02.714
I don't feel that way.

53:02.715 --> 53:06.417
- Where you went wrong
was really in the silhouette.

53:06.418 --> 53:10.855
The combination of
that A line, fur, stole,

53:10.856 --> 53:14.727
and the crop of those
pants-- the distribution

53:14.728 --> 53:17.730
of the proportions
didn't work for me.

53:17.731 --> 53:21.332
- You want to walk that line
between playful and childish,

53:21.333 --> 53:22.634
and I think, unfortunately,

53:22.635 --> 53:24.470
this falls on the childish side.

53:24.471 --> 53:26.772
Do you. You are colorful.

53:26.773 --> 53:28.738
You are quirky.

53:28.739 --> 53:31.410
But I think it's about making
sure that it's not too kitschy.

53:31.411 --> 53:34.799
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Katie.

53:34.800 --> 53:36.448
Thank you, Angelique.

53:36.449 --> 53:39.219
Kenneth, let's get
your model out here.

53:42.454 --> 53:44.899
Are you proud of your look?

53:44.900 --> 53:45.458
- I am proud of the story

53:45.459 --> 53:48.939
of the behind-the-scene
of what I did.

53:48.940 --> 53:49.295
But I am not proud

53:49.296 --> 53:51.663
of the overall effect
of what happened.

53:51.664 --> 53:53.765
- Okay, tell us about the story.

53:53.766 --> 53:57.902
- My inspiration originally
was the Tokyo streetwear,

53:57.903 --> 54:00.571
so I wanted to create a
lot of volumes, clean lines,

54:00.572 --> 54:02.674
and just very clean and fresh.

54:02.675 --> 54:05.511
This is supposed to be
the original look of it, too.

54:05.512 --> 54:08.379
But something happened
behind the scene.

54:08.380 --> 54:11.116
- No, you need to explain more.

54:11.117 --> 54:12.785
I hope they ask what happened.

54:12.786 --> 54:15.549
- I'm not understanding.

54:15.550 --> 54:19.323
- I asked everyone for their
little, like, scraps of fabrics

54:19.324 --> 54:20.591
that they don't want,

54:20.592 --> 54:23.328
because I want to
put it on my designs.

54:23.329 --> 54:25.363
I kept it raw, purposely,

54:25.364 --> 54:27.633
'cause that's
really what I felt.

54:27.634 --> 54:30.835
I was voiceless.

54:30.836 --> 54:33.706
I never felt
humiliated in my life.

54:37.976 --> 54:40.745
- Prajjé is crying too.

54:40.746 --> 54:43.828
- It feels like there's an
incident that happened

54:43.829 --> 54:44.250
that maybe we're not aware of.

54:44.351 --> 54:52.351
- It feels like there's an
incident that happened

54:55.228 --> 54:58.696
that maybe we're not aware of.

54:58.697 --> 55:03.134
- What did happen to him
in the workroom was not fair.

55:03.135 --> 55:06.571
It wasn't so much an argument;
it was more degrading him

55:06.572 --> 55:08.741
right into the workroom,
in front of his models,

55:08.742 --> 55:10.142
in front of everyone.
- Oh.

55:10.143 --> 55:11.477
- If you don't feel comfortable,

55:11.478 --> 55:12.710
we don't have to do this.

55:12.711 --> 55:14.645
- Oh, no, I think
it's ----ing bullsh--

55:14.646 --> 55:16.547
That you're doing this now.

55:16.548 --> 55:18.917
- Girl.
- Stop talking.

55:18.918 --> 55:20.551
- I couldn't even
speak for myself.

55:20.552 --> 55:23.421
I was just there, standing,

55:23.422 --> 55:27.598
just trying to disappear.

55:27.599 --> 55:29.560
- I am so sorry to hear that.

55:29.561 --> 55:31.263
- I don't think
he deserved that.

55:31.264 --> 55:34.133
- I am so proud of all of you

55:34.134 --> 55:36.669
for being supportive to him.

55:36.670 --> 55:38.636
- I would love to see
the look with this jacket,

55:38.637 --> 55:42.975
if that's what you had
originally intended.

55:42.976 --> 55:45.743
- I want to bring the whole
Asian community on this, like,

55:45.744 --> 55:49.147
the crazy rich Asian that
we wanted to watch on TV.

55:49.148 --> 55:52.183
That's why I picked him.

55:52.184 --> 55:55.754
I want to see my design on
somebody that looks like me,

55:55.755 --> 55:58.624
that I want to show it to
the world what we can do.

55:58.625 --> 56:00.491
- I actually did get the feeling

56:00.492 --> 56:04.596
that there was something
very Asian to those pants.

56:04.597 --> 56:07.700
And I did get a sense that
it was a patchwork effect

56:07.701 --> 56:09.301
that you were trying to get.

56:09.302 --> 56:10.535
- There is something
quite beautiful

56:10.536 --> 56:11.904
about the way that it ended up,

56:11.905 --> 56:13.638
because it represents community.

56:13.639 --> 56:16.274
So I do appreciate
that about the work.

56:16.275 --> 56:18.444
- Kenneth, unfortunately you had

56:18.445 --> 56:20.459
one of our least
favorite looks tonight.

56:20.460 --> 56:21.613
- I totally agree.

56:21.614 --> 56:24.549
- I think the issue
that I had with it

56:24.550 --> 56:26.785
<i>was the dichotomy
of the black pants</i>

56:26.786 --> 56:29.587
<i>that made me stop and be
like, what is going on here?</i>

56:29.588 --> 56:31.908
- Yeah.
- I wrote,

56:31.909 --> 56:34.792
"It's giving harem, soccer
player, cross guard."

56:34.793 --> 56:36.928
It's just, like, so many
different things happening.

56:36.929 --> 56:38.796
But you have a
great spirit about it.

56:38.797 --> 56:42.678
You're even able to smile and
find the humor in this moment.

56:42.679 --> 56:43.835
- My heart is bigger
than my brain.

56:43.836 --> 56:46.571
- I get that.
- So I have to balance it.

56:46.572 --> 56:48.941
And I hope I can
show more of my work.

56:48.942 --> 56:52.578
- Thank you, Kenneth.
Thank you, Tak.

56:52.579 --> 56:54.981
Christina, let's get
your model out here.

56:56.815 --> 56:58.817
There's so much I want
to know about this look.

56:58.818 --> 57:02.120
- Yeah, so when we
had this challenge

57:02.121 --> 57:06.259
about streetwear, I immediately
thought about New York--

57:06.260 --> 57:09.828
<i>That it's very intense, and
you're always in the movement.</i>

57:09.829 --> 57:13.832
So I wanted to use
plaid and striped fabric

57:13.833 --> 57:15.667
and combine it together.

57:15.668 --> 57:20.372
And I cut it like this,
and stitched the sleeve.

57:20.373 --> 57:25.477
- Doing that many things in one
look can go super, super wrong.

57:25.478 --> 57:29.488
And this is very
sophisticated, I think.

57:29.489 --> 57:30.683
- We need to talk after
the show, because that top,

57:30.684 --> 57:32.183
I may want to take
that back home.

57:32.184 --> 57:34.152
Like, I just love it.
Just ten out of ten.

57:34.153 --> 57:35.553
Gorgeous. Mwah.

57:35.554 --> 57:37.569
- Thank you.

57:37.570 --> 57:40.598
- That is the most
incredible design.

57:40.599 --> 57:45.979
It was a combination that
really looks so modern.

57:45.980 --> 57:46.865
- This is my favorite word.

57:46.866 --> 57:49.368
- Well, darling,
you delivered on it.

57:49.369 --> 57:50.669
- Thank you, Christina.

57:50.670 --> 57:53.729
Thank you, Deedee.

57:53.730 --> 57:54.173
Thanks, everyone.

57:54.174 --> 57:57.676
We need some time to talk
together about your looks,

57:57.677 --> 58:00.460
so you can leave the runway.

58:05.849 --> 58:08.654
- You got this.

58:08.655 --> 58:10.656
- Your look is stronger.
- They were wrong.

58:10.657 --> 58:12.825
I would rock the
[bleep] out of your prints.

58:12.826 --> 58:14.892
They are amazing.
- Don't make me cry.

58:14.893 --> 58:18.763
I can't cry before I go
back out there again.

58:18.764 --> 58:21.899
- All right, let's discuss
our favorite looks.

58:21.900 --> 58:24.636
Let's start by talking
about Christina.

58:24.637 --> 58:26.437
<i>- I don't know if it was cool,</i>

58:26.438 --> 58:28.607
but it was certainly
very modern.

58:28.608 --> 58:30.808
- It's a totally fresh
take on streetwear.

58:30.809 --> 58:32.910
This is a little
bit of everything.

58:32.911 --> 58:36.415
<i>It's Japan, it's
London, it's New York.</i>

58:36.416 --> 58:39.884
- Her look, to me, is cool.
Sort of like a performance

58:39.885 --> 58:41.754
<i>or sort of, like,
cinematic elements with it</i>

58:41.755 --> 58:45.624
I feel like maybe the
other designs don't have.

58:45.625 --> 58:48.393
- When we've done
streetwear challenges before,

58:48.394 --> 58:51.763
it's always, like, you
get the stereotypical look.

58:51.764 --> 58:53.332
- Yeah.
- But I felt like this

58:53.333 --> 58:56.502
was just something
that I still cannot place it.

58:56.503 --> 58:58.236
So, for me, that's exciting.

58:58.237 --> 59:03.241
And that's enough to think
about making her the winner.

59:03.242 --> 59:04.776
- We have to talk about Prajjé.

59:04.777 --> 59:06.779
- He put his heart
into that, you know?

59:06.780 --> 59:10.749
- Listening to the story, it
was an entire education.

59:10.750 --> 59:14.652
And there was so much
passion in that outfit from him.

59:14.653 --> 59:15.921
- It's really conceptual, yeah.

59:15.922 --> 59:19.249
- And that is at the
root of streetwear.

59:19.250 --> 59:23.127
- I mean, Nina Garcia
could sell me a used wrapper.

59:23.128 --> 59:26.864
<i>I think he executed on
the separates perfectly.</i>

59:26.865 --> 59:31.368
- I really appreciate all
of Prajjé's original ideas.

59:31.369 --> 59:32.837
But there's something about it

59:32.838 --> 59:35.107
that's a little bit
less wearable.

59:35.108 --> 59:37.375
<i>It's just a more
specific consumer</i>

59:37.376 --> 59:41.279
who's gonna really be
able to appreciate that.

59:41.280 --> 59:46.484
In the category of desirability
and actual wearability,

59:46.485 --> 59:48.152
I think Aaron wins out,

59:48.153 --> 59:50.455
<i>because those are
marketable pieces</i>

59:50.456 --> 59:54.459
that you could wear every day.
And I really appreciated that.

59:54.460 --> 59:56.861
- Aaron, for me,
wins out in the styling.

59:56.862 --> 59:58.863
<i>The hair, the makeup,</i>

59:58.864 --> 1:00:01.667
<i>the sunglasses--
It was all right.</i>

1:00:01.668 --> 1:00:03.736
To me, you know,
as an ex-stylist,

1:00:03.737 --> 1:00:05.803
it's all coming
down to the styling.

1:00:05.804 --> 1:00:07.205
- Yeah, and, you
know, the jacket

1:00:07.206 --> 1:00:09.241
<i>is really cool literally
inside and out.</i>

1:00:09.242 --> 1:00:12.276
Aaron for me was
one of the best looks.

1:00:12.277 --> 1:00:14.312
<i>- Okay, let's talk about Zayden.</i>

1:00:14.313 --> 1:00:17.482
That coat--I mean, I think
we could all wear that coat.

1:00:17.483 --> 1:00:18.683
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1:00:18.684 --> 1:00:20.185
- And translate it--
- All of us.

1:00:20.186 --> 1:00:22.154
- Yes! And translate it
with our own personal style.

1:00:22.155 --> 1:00:23.955
Then I just loved
that, on the back,

1:00:23.956 --> 1:00:28.393
<i>it had that message that
was so clear and so resonant.</i>

1:00:28.394 --> 1:00:30.596
- If this coat were a drop...

1:00:30.597 --> 1:00:32.765
- Yes.
- We would all be going for it.

1:00:32.766 --> 1:00:35.466
- 100%.
- Right?

1:00:35.467 --> 1:00:39.571
- I almost feel like it comes
down to styling element

1:00:39.572 --> 1:00:41.738
versus the story,

1:00:41.739 --> 1:00:43.375
and it's what's more
important to streetwear

1:00:43.376 --> 1:00:46.377
and the streetwear consumer--
What are they looking for?

1:00:46.378 --> 1:00:47.813
<i>- I can't remember a time</i>

1:00:47.914 --> 1:00:55.914
- It's sort of a bummer
that we have to

1:00:58.625 --> 1:00:59.892
choose someone
to go home tonight,

1:00:59.893 --> 1:01:03.861
because I feel like they all
really put their heart into it.

1:01:03.862 --> 1:01:06.732
- It's more than
just the design.

1:01:06.733 --> 1:01:09.301
They all made it so personal.

1:01:09.302 --> 1:01:11.203
- I'm gonna start with Darren.

1:01:11.204 --> 1:01:14.939
<i>I did appreciate
that he really loved it.</i>

1:01:14.940 --> 1:01:16.808
- I'm glad he loved
his outfit so much.

1:01:16.809 --> 1:01:18.509
- Totally.
- Yeah, yeah.

1:01:18.510 --> 1:01:20.913
- I'm glad somebody--you know?
- And he might be the only one.

1:01:20.914 --> 1:01:23.848
- Darren's look, to me,
they've clearly either

1:01:23.849 --> 1:01:26.551
just come from a
Halloween costume store

1:01:26.552 --> 1:01:28.621
or they're going to work at one.

1:01:30.289 --> 1:01:31.422
Let's talk about Kenneth.

1:01:31.423 --> 1:01:33.524
- No one on no street

1:01:33.525 --> 1:01:36.261
<i>is wearing what Kenneth
put down this runway.</i>

1:01:36.262 --> 1:01:38.397
- You said it--crossing
guard, goalkeeper.

1:01:38.398 --> 1:01:40.466
- Yeah.
- And the story can't save him.

1:01:40.467 --> 1:01:42.167
- I don't want to defend
him for any reason,

1:01:42.168 --> 1:01:46.337
but I do think you have
this situation happen to you,

1:01:46.338 --> 1:01:48.806
and it must have
been very difficult.

1:01:48.807 --> 1:01:50.843
I'm not taking that lightly.

1:01:50.844 --> 1:01:54.747
- But did he put his
emotions into his design

1:01:54.748 --> 1:01:57.950
in a way that
somebody's gonna wear?

1:01:57.951 --> 1:01:59.884
- Let's talk about Katie.

1:01:59.885 --> 1:02:01.419
<i>- I just think she had a problem</i>

1:02:01.420 --> 1:02:02.955
with the proportions here.

1:02:02.956 --> 1:02:05.624
- She has a really
well-defined point of view,

1:02:05.625 --> 1:02:06.959
which is more than

1:02:06.960 --> 1:02:09.160
we can say for a number
of these designers.

1:02:09.161 --> 1:02:12.663
<i>To Nina's point, there was a
big problem with proportion.</i>

1:02:12.664 --> 1:02:14.799
And if you're
dressing for women,

1:02:14.800 --> 1:02:16.234
not kindergarteners,

1:02:16.235 --> 1:02:18.937
you have to make sure
that those proportions

1:02:18.938 --> 1:02:21.440
are flattering on a
grown woman's body.

1:02:23.208 --> 1:02:25.243
- I've seen something
from Kenneth

1:02:25.244 --> 1:02:27.312
that shows me
promise as a designer,

1:02:27.313 --> 1:02:29.314
and I've seen two
things from Darren

1:02:29.315 --> 1:02:32.151
that I'm not feeling
optimistic about.

1:02:32.152 --> 1:02:35.821
- Whose was worse,
Darren's or Kenneth's?

1:02:35.822 --> 1:02:37.189
- I'm gonna go with Kenneth.

1:02:37.190 --> 1:02:39.924
- I gotta agree.
- Oh, I disagree.

1:02:39.925 --> 1:02:42.160
I think Darren's is worse.

1:02:42.161 --> 1:02:44.129
- No! I think the
exact opposite.

1:02:44.130 --> 1:02:45.997
- Me too--I think the opposite.

1:02:45.998 --> 1:02:48.466
- All right, what are
we gonna do here?

1:02:48.467 --> 1:02:51.271
- Let's get the designers
back on the runway.

1:02:55.708 --> 1:02:58.643
- Christina, Aaron,

1:02:58.644 --> 1:03:00.913
Prajjé, and Zayden,

1:03:00.914 --> 1:03:03.781
only one of you
can be the winner.

1:03:03.782 --> 1:03:06.451
And the winner is...

1:03:06.452 --> 1:03:10.189
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

1:03:10.190 --> 1:03:12.658
Prajjé.

1:03:12.659 --> 1:03:15.326
[applause]

1:03:15.327 --> 1:03:16.662
- Thank you so much.

1:03:16.663 --> 1:03:17.763
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1:03:17.764 --> 1:03:19.598
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1:03:19.599 --> 1:03:23.201
It feels amazing to win this
challenge with a message

1:03:23.202 --> 1:03:27.605
that I'm trying to expose
on to this massive platform.

1:03:27.606 --> 1:03:29.975
That to me is priceless.

1:03:29.976 --> 1:03:32.544
<i>That to me is a
moment for myself--</i>

1:03:32.545 --> 1:03:35.808
To win with my country,
and for my country.

1:03:35.809 --> 1:03:39.551
- Prajjé, you gave
us passion, creativity.

1:03:39.552 --> 1:03:41.720
We were really impressed.

1:03:41.721 --> 1:03:43.888
- I've never won
anything before.

1:03:43.889 --> 1:03:45.890
Tonight is definitely
a reassurance

1:03:45.891 --> 1:03:47.225
that I'm in the right path.

1:03:47.226 --> 1:03:50.261
- Well, congratulations,
because you've also won

1:03:50.262 --> 1:03:52.230
immunity in the next challenge.

1:03:52.231 --> 1:03:54.633
- Thank you.
- Well done.

1:03:54.634 --> 1:03:56.334
- Thank you.

1:03:56.335 --> 1:04:00.605
- Christina, Aaron,
and Zayden, you are in.

1:04:00.606 --> 1:04:06.179
Katie, Kenneth, and Darren,
this was a very tough decision.

1:04:08.347 --> 1:04:11.851
Someone has already gone
home during this challenge.

1:04:15.588 --> 1:04:17.589
So, we feel like...

1:04:17.590 --> 1:04:21.893
no one else should
have to. You're all in.

1:04:21.894 --> 1:04:24.462
- [sighing in relief]

1:04:24.463 --> 1:04:26.397
[applause]

1:04:26.398 --> 1:04:28.834
I want to hug you.

1:04:28.835 --> 1:04:30.868
Oh, thank goodness.

1:04:30.869 --> 1:04:34.138
- Go celebrate, and
most importantly,

1:04:34.139 --> 1:04:36.408
please bring it next week.

1:04:36.409 --> 1:04:38.109
- Thank you.
- Thank you, thank you.

1:04:38.110 --> 1:04:41.613
- Bye.
[relieved laughter]

1:04:41.614 --> 1:04:45.849
- Ooh, this is emotional.
- Incredible, yeah.

1:04:46.418 --> 1:04:49.322
[all cheering wildly]

1:04:54.793 --> 1:04:59.131
- Guys. all: Hi!

1:04:59.132 --> 1:05:01.600
- All these smiles.
- Yes.

1:05:01.601 --> 1:05:03.535
- Isn't it nice?
- Yes.

1:05:03.536 --> 1:05:05.337
- I know the last few
days have been tough.

1:05:05.338 --> 1:05:07.105
I think you guys needed this.

1:05:07.106 --> 1:05:09.674
And, Prajjé, congratulations.

1:05:09.675 --> 1:05:11.276
- Thank you.
- Yay.

1:05:11.277 --> 1:05:12.578
- I'll see you guys really soon.

1:05:12.579 --> 1:05:15.413
All: Bye.
- Bye-ee.

1:05:15.414 --> 1:05:16.614
- Close the door.

1:05:16.615 --> 1:05:18.616
- Somebody, close that
door, lock it, and let's go home.

1:05:18.617 --> 1:05:20.151
<i>- On the next "Project Runway."</i>

1:05:20.152 --> 1:05:22.354
- Ghosts! I'm home!

1:05:22.355 --> 1:05:24.522
[all shrieking]

1:05:24.523 --> 1:05:26.158
<i>- Designers.</i>

1:05:26.159 --> 1:05:28.694
- These photos are creepy.

1:05:28.695 --> 1:05:30.962
- I'm done. Oh, boy.

1:05:30.963 --> 1:05:33.665
- You better not
give a little sailor look.

1:05:33.666 --> 1:05:36.868
- It's not gonna be a
sailor. It is not sailor.

1:05:36.869 --> 1:05:39.138
- It is "Popeye
Goes West," honey.

1:05:39.139 --> 1:05:41.406
Are you scared now?
- [sighs]

1:05:41.407 --> 1:05:44.743
- Please welcome
Taraji P. Henson.

1:05:44.744 --> 1:05:46.645
- Hello!
[cheers and applause]

1:05:46.646 --> 1:05:49.147
- It did not look finished.

1:05:49.148 --> 1:05:51.683
- Like, for me, a pet
peeve is difficult clothing.

1:05:51.684 --> 1:05:54.152
- That part of the dress
was not well-constructed.

1:05:54.153 --> 1:05:56.222
It shows every single flaw.
