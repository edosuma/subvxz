WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:03.109
Hey. I couldn't find the
article about you teaching

00:03.169 --> 00:05.705
sex ed to seniors, but I did
find this folder labeled

00:05.772 --> 00:08.275
"Senior sex ed thank-you
notes." Don't open that.

00:08.341 --> 00:09.581
There's pictures in there.

00:09.709 --> 00:10.949
Ho! There are pictures.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.422
There are lots of pictures.

00:12.479 --> 00:15.653
Why would you not throw these
away or incinerate them?

00:15.715 --> 00:18.059
Because every memory
deserves to be chronicled.

00:18.118 --> 00:19.324
Even the saggy ones.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.923
I am putting together
a scrapbook commemorating

00:21.988 --> 00:23.524
my first year on
the city council.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.969
This year whizzed by so fast. There
was so much more I wanted to do.

00:27.027 --> 00:31.874
But time is the relentless and cruel
enemy of the devoted civil servant.

00:32.098 --> 00:35.341
It's actually one of the
sub-titles of my scrapbook.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.008
Probably would've
gotten more stuff done

00:38.071 --> 00:40.881
if I hadn't spent so much time
brainstorming scrapbook titles.

00:41.408 --> 00:43.285
Ben and Leslie's day off.
Let's go relax.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.721
I cannot wait
for our day off.

00:45.779 --> 00:48.817
But what if
we took a day on

00:48.882 --> 00:50.691
and stayed here and worked
on some projects? Hmm.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.991
That sounds pretty sexy, right?
No.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.796
Leslie, you've worked non-stop.
Holidays and weekends.

00:56.856 --> 00:58.233
You'rejust
gonna take a day off.

00:58.291 --> 00:59.429
It'll be good for you.

00:59.559 --> 01:00.697
All right. You're cute.

01:00.760 --> 01:01.830
And you're right.
Come on.

01:01.928 --> 01:02.929
Let's relax.
All right.

01:03.596 --> 01:06.805
Hey, April. I'll be gone for
the next 19-and-a-half hours,

01:06.866 --> 01:08.641
so can you water my
plants in my office?

01:08.701 --> 01:10.510
We are all out of water,
actually.

01:10.637 --> 01:12.446
I'll have to use
boiling hot milk.

01:12.505 --> 01:13.848
Are you really gonna do that?
Yes.

01:14.441 --> 01:16.148
Well, everybody.

01:16.910 --> 01:21.984
Wow! It has been an honor and a
pleasure to work with you all.

01:22.048 --> 01:25.325
The time I have spent at Parks and
Rec have been the happiest days

01:25.385 --> 01:27.126
of my life here
in the government.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.098
And I know everyone says it,
but I sincerely hope

01:30.190 --> 01:31.430
that we stay in touch.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.706
What the...is
happening right now?

01:37.864 --> 01:40.105
Today's my last day, Leslie.
I'm retiring.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.405
What? Why didn't
you tell us?

01:42.535 --> 01:44.208
Well, I didn't want
to make a big fuss.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.342
Although, gosh, I'm pretty sure
I mentioned it a few times.

01:47.407 --> 01:49.250
Oh, God, they're gonna
fire people, aren't they?

01:49.309 --> 01:50.947
Yeah, I am two years
from my pension.

01:51.311 --> 01:54.588
Can you believe it? Only six
months left until I retire.

01:56.082 --> 01:57.186
What did Jerry say?

01:57.317 --> 01:58.421
Jerry was here?

01:58.751 --> 02:00.424
Well, this is
my last weep.

02:00.620 --> 02:04.227
Oops! I mean,
"weep." Week.

02:04.324 --> 02:05.325
(LAUGHS)

02:06.192 --> 02:07.262
Geez.

02:07.494 --> 02:08.598
(LAUGHING)

02:09.229 --> 02:11.800
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Just wait.
Everybody wait. Okay.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.401
As much as we
want this to happen,

02:13.533 --> 02:15.069
we can't let
Jerry just disappear.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.876
We have to
commemorate this somehow.

02:16.936 --> 02:21.180
You're right. Jerry, thank
you for your service.

02:21.241 --> 02:22.447
Good-bye.

02:22.509 --> 02:25.922
Thanks, Ron.
That speech means a lot.

02:25.979 --> 02:29.290
Okay, well, I am going to go and
say good-bye to some other folks.

02:30.617 --> 02:32.187
Okay, see you
tomorrow, Jerry.

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:53.139 --> 02:57.144
So we ran all your tests,
and everything looks great.

02:57.577 --> 03:01.081
(SIGHS) You might be the healthiest
human being we've ever seen.

03:01.147 --> 03:03.787
You have the resting heart rate
of a 100-year-old tortoise.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.329
Yes, I get that a lot.

03:05.385 --> 03:08.332
So my childhood illness... There's
no chancel would pass that on?

03:08.388 --> 03:11.164
It wasn't genetic, so you
shouldn't worry at all.

03:11.224 --> 03:13.898
You have every reason
to expect a healthy child.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.666
In fact, if you'd like, you can
provide your sample today.

03:17.363 --> 03:20.071
Today?
Like, today, today?

03:20.133 --> 03:21.407
This today?
Well, yes.

03:21.467 --> 03:23.970
I mean, the timing is right according
to Ann's ovulation schedule.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.779
Unless there's a reason you'd
like to wait till next month.

03:26.906 --> 03:28.146
(sums)

03:28.408 --> 03:29.887
No.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.251
None.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.453
One other question.
Completely off topic.

03:33.513 --> 03:36.722
Would I be providing
this sample... Today?

03:38.418 --> 03:40.625
Here I am thinking
about how fast

03:40.687 --> 03:42.860
my first year in
city council has gone,

03:42.922 --> 03:47.234
and Jerry has had 40 years whiz past
him with nothing to show for it.

03:47.293 --> 03:48.772
This is everything
in his file,

03:48.861 --> 03:51.364
a handicapped parking sticker
from when he got gout,

03:51.431 --> 03:54.935
a Parks and Rec golf cart
driving exam which he failed,

03:55.034 --> 03:57.014
a scathing
performance review.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.309
I mean, why would
anyone be so mean?

03:59.606 --> 04:00.710
Oh, wait. I wrote this.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.244
I stand by it.

04:02.308 --> 04:03.912
Well, Jerry was
never really the type

04:04.043 --> 04:07.217
to rise above
mediocrity or to it.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.122
That's what I thought,
but when he started,

04:09.249 --> 04:11.024
he had a lot of
dreams and goals.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.564
I mean, look at his
original entry paperwork.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.361
He wanted to meet the mayor,
have a building named after him.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.632
I just can't let Jerry leave here with
nothing and go home to an empty life.

04:20.726 --> 04:23.799
Well, I'll help with anything.
Just promise we'll do it quickly.

04:23.863 --> 04:25.672
I'm making us a mac
and cheese pizza for...

04:25.732 --> 04:27.234
Mac and cheese pizza?
Yeah.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.643
You're making that?
Yeah.

04:28.735 --> 04:29.736
(GASPS)

04:31.971 --> 04:34.508
Torturing Jerry was my
favorite thing in the world.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.217
After making out
with you.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.347
Remember when we did both
at the same time?

04:38.411 --> 04:40.288
It made him
so uncomfortable.

04:40.346 --> 04:41.347
(BOTH LAUGHING)

04:41.447 --> 04:44.121
This is a sad day. Who are
we gonna make fun of now?

04:44.183 --> 04:45.184
RON: No need to worry.

04:45.251 --> 04:47.788
Every place I've ever worked
in has had a "Jerry."

04:47.854 --> 04:48.992
When one Jerry leaves,

04:49.055 --> 04:52.628
the office naturally selects
a new Jerry to fill that role.

04:52.692 --> 04:55.536
It's Social Darwinism.
The strong prey on the weak.

04:55.762 --> 04:59.539
Soon, one of you
will be ridiculed mercilessly.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.607
Ha! Nature.

05:04.604 --> 05:06.140
Okay.
My transfer was approved.

05:06.205 --> 05:09.550
So starting now, lam an employee
of the County Health Board.

05:09.609 --> 05:10.883
You are no longer
my boss,

05:10.943 --> 05:12.854
and we can have a baby without
it being a conflict of interest.

05:12.912 --> 05:14.186
Clear sailing.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.386
Goodbye, Ann Perkins,
my excellent employee.

05:16.716 --> 05:19.162
Hello, Ann Perkins,
my fallopian princess.

05:19.419 --> 05:20.864
So here's the drill.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.260
Make a deposit in here.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.233
If you fill it up all the way,
you get on the board.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.871
Then we take the sample,
spin it in the centrifuge,

05:27.927 --> 05:29.201
and prepare it
for fertilization.

05:29.262 --> 05:30.434
Sounds romantic.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.708
I guess it's go time.
Go time!

05:34.434 --> 05:36.072
Wait, what am I doing?
I don't go with you.

05:36.135 --> 05:40.049
Oh, no, no. I go in alone with this
pornographic disc and do it myself.

05:40.106 --> 05:41.346
And you stay out here

05:41.407 --> 05:42.909
and try not to think about
what I'm doing in there.

05:42.975 --> 05:44.545
And I try not to think
about you waiting out here

05:44.610 --> 05:45.953
trying not to
think about me.

05:46.212 --> 05:47.452
Should I think about you?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.387
This is so weird.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.486
Chris, we don't
have to do this today.

05:51.851 --> 05:55.924
This was totally just sprung on us.
Let's just take a moment.

05:55.988 --> 05:58.559
There's so many
pamphlets to look at.

05:58.624 --> 06:02.265
Yes, we do have very important
pamphlet reading to do.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.338
Excellent idea,
Ann Perkins.

06:05.331 --> 06:06.605
Do I keep this?

06:07.100 --> 06:10.343
I don't know. It feels wrong to
leave it here. Give it to me.

06:12.972 --> 06:14.007
I panicked. Run!

06:17.110 --> 06:19.920
Here are the last
of the Animal Control reports.

06:23.015 --> 06:24.392
What are you doing,
weirdo?

06:24.617 --> 06:26.824
Just trying not
to spill anything.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.728
I believe Leslie said
to organize these by year.

06:30.022 --> 06:32.832
Way ahead of you.
I made two pile files.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.160
(DONNA LAUGHS)

06:34.427 --> 06:37.465
Pilo fibles. Filo pilos.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.133
Filo pilos?
That's not right.

06:39.198 --> 06:40.438
Are you broken?
(APRIL LAUGHS)

06:40.566 --> 06:42.409
No, everything's fine.
(RON LAUGHS)

06:42.502 --> 06:44.607
Well, I guess that settles
who the new Jerry is.

06:44.670 --> 06:47.082
No, it doesn't!
I barely even said it wrong.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.710
Said it wrong.
Stop it!

06:48.875 --> 06:50.149
(ALL LAUGH)

06:51.344 --> 06:52.687
This is how it begins.

06:53.112 --> 06:54.489
The next "Jerry."

06:54.614 --> 06:57.060
One screwed-up sentence,
and 30 years later,

06:57.116 --> 06:58.959
I'm wearing
aquamarine sweater vests

06:59.018 --> 07:02.693
and listening to Bonnie Raitt and
The <i>Da Vinci Code</i> on my iPod.

07:05.391 --> 07:06.563
(ALL LAUGH)

07:06.859 --> 07:07.963
It's already started.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.539
Believe it or not,
Jerry, you were young once.

07:12.598 --> 07:13.872
Young and full of dreams.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.640
(LAUGHS) I forgot I wrote
all this.

07:15.701 --> 07:18.807
And as unrealistic and
absurd as those goals were,

07:18.905 --> 07:21.511
we are not letting you retire
until we help you achieve them.

07:22.508 --> 07:24.351
So let's see
what's first.

07:24.410 --> 07:27.687
"Eat in city council private
dining room." That we can achieve.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.927
Right now?
Sure. Let's go.

07:30.349 --> 07:31.487
Authorized personnel only.

07:31.617 --> 07:32.755
Oh, they're with me.

07:32.819 --> 07:35.857
City Councilor Leslie Knope,
clearance level four.

07:35.922 --> 07:38.300
Guests are only
allowed on Wednesdays.

07:38.357 --> 07:40.394
And we don't have
clearance levels.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.997
I know, but shouldn't we?
I mean, it sounds so cool.

07:43.062 --> 07:45.042
Anyway, we just need to get
in there real quick

07:45.097 --> 07:46.701
and maybe take a picture.

07:46.766 --> 07:50.236
He's retiring as a City Hall
employee after 41 years,

07:50.303 --> 07:51.839
and it was his dream
to eat here.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.315
His dream? Really?

07:54.207 --> 07:55.379
Still no.

07:55.441 --> 07:56.442
It's okay, Leslie.
Come on.

07:56.509 --> 07:57.544
But thank you.
Thank you for trying.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.419
No, no, no, no, no. I promised
you an executive meal

07:59.479 --> 08:00.617
and you're gonna
get one.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.660
Ben. Okay.

08:02.715 --> 08:05.093
I'm gonna go in there
and take a picture with Jerry.

08:05.218 --> 08:06.856
I put my arm around nothing.

08:06.919 --> 08:09.160
And then you photoshop
him in later, okay?

08:12.758 --> 08:14.396
Congratulations
on your retirement.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.200
Aw, thank you.

08:17.396 --> 08:20.468
One, three,
seven, two, five, nine.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.402
Sudoku is easy.

08:23.703 --> 08:25.444
Is there even
rules to this game?

08:25.838 --> 08:28.682
There's a natural successor
to Jerry's sad, smelly crown.

08:28.741 --> 08:31.585
And it's not me.
It's Andy.

08:31.878 --> 08:34.984
Big guy? Check.
Goofy? Check.

08:35.114 --> 08:37.457
All I have to do is wait
for a textbook Dwyer screw-up,

08:37.517 --> 08:40.191
which usually
happens every 20 minutes.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.929
Hey, if it isn't Filo Pilo.

08:42.989 --> 08:45.196
Real creative, Donna.
You expect that to catch on?

08:45.258 --> 08:46.328
Babe, the pen.

08:48.127 --> 08:51.802
Look at Andy. There's ink all over him.
Andy's the new Jerry.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.866
Game over.
Awesome.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.640
Hey, I'm like a giant squid.

08:55.735 --> 08:56.839
Hey, honey,
I'm ink Dracula.

08:56.969 --> 08:58.107
No, stop.

08:58.170 --> 09:00.172
Squid Dracula is going to get you.
(APRIL SCREAMS)

09:00.473 --> 09:01.884
(ANDY ROARS)

09:02.108 --> 09:03.416
Barking up
the wrong tree, Filo.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.851
What do you mean?

09:05.144 --> 09:07.750
Andy will never be the new Jerry.
Nothing embarrasses him.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.793
He's like a giant
puppy with no shame.

09:09.849 --> 09:12.591
What you need is some
fresh meat in the office.

09:12.652 --> 09:14.495
Or you guys could just stop
making fun of me.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.090
Yeah. No.

09:17.957 --> 09:21.803
Okay, on to the next Jerry
goal, meet Mayor Knudson.

09:21.928 --> 09:24.909
Oh, yeah. He was the
mayor at the time.

09:24.997 --> 09:26.999
I've always
wanted to meet him.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.340
Well, today you're
getting that chance.

09:30.636 --> 09:33.116
So was he like
a really great mayor?

09:33.272 --> 09:34.478
No, not really.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.611
He resigned because of
corruption and racketeering,

09:36.676 --> 09:38.678
and then he died from
an overdose of pills.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.246
But actually his
real cause of death

09:40.313 --> 09:42.589
was being thrown out of a
helicopter while handcuffed.

09:42.648 --> 09:43.956
<i>Some people say
he's still alive</i>

09:44.083 --> 09:45.426
<i>because they
never found the body,</i>

09:45.985 --> 09:48.829
but they never found the body
because he exploded on impact.

09:48.888 --> 09:50.526
Sounds like a good dude.
JERRY: Yeah.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.769
I just wish I had
a chance to meet him,

09:52.825 --> 09:56.568
you know, years ago before all
the scandals and his death.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.437
But this is nice too.

09:58.497 --> 09:59.805
Is it?

09:59.932 --> 10:01.240
Yes, it is.
Mmm-hmm.

10:01.667 --> 10:02.941
Okay, go over there.

10:03.002 --> 10:05.608
Let's meet Mayor Knudson.
I'll take your picture.

10:05.671 --> 10:06.706
Butterflies.

10:06.772 --> 10:07.773
(LESLIE AND JERRY LAUGH)

10:07.873 --> 10:09.375
Hello, Mr. Mayor.

10:09.842 --> 10:10.980
First of all,
I'm so sorry

10:11.043 --> 10:13.523
that those Serbian mobsters shoved
you out of that helicopter.

10:13.579 --> 10:14.580
You deserve better.

10:14.981 --> 10:17.052
Okay, you tried,
but I took a day off

10:17.116 --> 10:20.791
to spend with you, not with you
and Jerry and a dead mayor.

10:20.886 --> 10:22.331
Can we please
just call it a day?

10:22.388 --> 10:24.527
No, we can't because
in a few short years,

10:24.590 --> 10:26.035
we're gonna be
visiting Jerry here,

10:26.092 --> 10:27.298
and he will have
achieved nothing.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.595
Is that what you want?

10:28.661 --> 10:30.038
No.
Okay, then.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.506
It's really been
nice to meet you.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.706
Okay, Jerry, let's go.
(CLEARS THROAT) Whoo.

10:34.166 --> 10:36.112
Ron-fire of the Vanities.

10:36.235 --> 10:37.509
Filo Pilo.

10:37.603 --> 10:38.707
(SIGHS)
Are you kidding me?

10:39.138 --> 10:41.175
Listen, now that
Jerry's gone,

10:41.240 --> 10:42.583
we need to hire someone
to pick up the slack.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.985
A new person in the office?

10:44.043 --> 10:45.886
Not a person. An intern.

10:46.445 --> 10:48.482
Why on earth
would I get an intern?

10:48.581 --> 10:51.494
Interns cost nothing
to the taxpayer.

10:51.784 --> 10:54.287
And more importantly, they're
usually stupid and terrible.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.890
So they get no work done. It's like
a Jerry you don't have to pay.

10:56.956 --> 10:59.061
Damn, son. That is
one compelling argument.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.065
Keep it up, Filo.

11:01.127 --> 11:03.129
We may destroy this government
one day after all.

11:05.965 --> 11:08.377
These pamphlets
are fascinating.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.812
It says here that some men
gain "sympathy weight"

11:10.870 --> 11:12.110
when their partners
get pregnant.

11:12.371 --> 11:14.783
If that happens to me, I'll be miserable.
But happy.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.148
But sad.

11:16.475 --> 11:21.515
I would have never imagined the
baby-making process to be this clinical.

11:21.580 --> 11:23.753
I mean, imagine if
actual sex were like this.

11:23.816 --> 11:25.261
Let me remove my clothes

11:25.317 --> 11:29.094
so we may begin to engage in physical
activity to multiply our genes.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.326
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

11:30.456 --> 11:32.595
And it's also
weird because we dated

11:32.658 --> 11:35.104
and we remember what
it's like to engage

11:35.194 --> 11:36.867
in some of those
physical activities.

11:36.929 --> 11:37.999
Exactly.

11:38.130 --> 11:42.340
And we were also pretty good
at those physical activities.

11:42.401 --> 11:44.108
(LAUGHS) Yes, we were.

11:45.271 --> 11:46.875
Yes, we were.

11:52.344 --> 11:54.585
You know,
is this all the pamphlets?

11:54.647 --> 11:59.426
'Cause I think that maybe I
have some left in my bedroom.

11:59.485 --> 12:02.159
Oh, well, then, we should
definitely go look for those.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.564
Let's find those.
We need to find those.

12:03.622 --> 12:04.896
Hurry.

12:10.262 --> 12:12.071
Okay, everyone
gather around.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.439
Leslie, I really
appreciate this,

12:13.499 --> 12:15.706
but I did promise Gayle I
would leave by 5:00. (LAUGHS)

12:15.768 --> 12:20.239
She has a tasty surprise waiting
for me, if you know what I mean.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.680
Gross, Jerry.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.879
She made a meatloaf.

12:22.942 --> 12:24.387
LESLIE: Well, this is better
than meatloaf.

12:24.443 --> 12:25.751
When Jerry first
applied for this job,

12:25.811 --> 12:28.690
one of this goals was to have
a building named after him.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.422
Again, that is an absurd request
considering your work record.

12:31.484 --> 12:35.091
But I thought maybe he could
have a room named after him.

12:35.387 --> 12:38.197
So henceforth,
Parks and Rec conference room

12:38.257 --> 12:42.831
will serve as a testament to
your years of public service.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.234
Oh, my God.

12:44.363 --> 12:45.603
Hear, hear.

12:45.664 --> 12:49.737
(SIGHS) "Jerry Gergich Memorial
Conference Room. RIP"?

12:50.236 --> 12:53.513
(LAUGHS) Oh, the guy at the plaque
store thought you had died.

12:53.839 --> 12:55.910
It was a rush job, so we
didn't have time to change it.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.949
It doesn't matter. We can just
pretend it means "retire in peace."

12:59.378 --> 13:00.618
Yeah.
Yeah, okay.

13:00.679 --> 13:01.885
So bring out the cake!

13:01.947 --> 13:05.394
JERRY: Oh! Wow!
Speech, speech, speech.

13:05.518 --> 13:06.656
Well, thank you, guys.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.757
I'm not much of a speechmaker,
but I do like good cake.

13:11.056 --> 13:12.057
DONNA: Uh...
JERRY: Mmm...

13:12.291 --> 13:13.361
You're on fire.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.568
(GASPS) Whoa!

13:15.694 --> 13:16.900
Oh, my God, Jerry!

13:27.306 --> 13:30.617
Well, that went roughly
as well as I thought it would.

13:33.179 --> 13:35.716
I promised Gayle I'd leave at 5:00.
I guess this is it.

13:35.815 --> 13:36.816
(GIGGLES)

13:37.716 --> 13:38.820
Bye.

13:39.585 --> 13:40.893
See you tomorrow, Jeremy.

13:41.787 --> 13:44.666
Well, pretty heroic,
huh, guys?

13:45.024 --> 13:46.059
Hard to make fun of that.

13:46.192 --> 13:47.227
Man, the cake.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.631
Filo Pilo ruined
the cake.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.435
Classic Pilo.

13:51.564 --> 13:53.168
What? How is that
my fault?

13:53.232 --> 13:55.371
Stupid Jerry. Should have
never saved his life.

13:57.369 --> 13:58.575
(KNOCKING)

13:59.738 --> 14:00.773
Well...

14:00.840 --> 14:02.649
Hey, Jerry.
Do you have a second?

14:02.708 --> 14:04.847
Leslie. Well,
this is a lovely surprise.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.014
Come on in. Have
breakfast with the family.

14:06.078 --> 14:09.525
That's okay. I just popped by to
apologize and to give you something.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.253
Is that Leslie Knope?
Yes.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.387
Hi, Gayle.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.622
What a surprise.

14:14.086 --> 14:16.088
I insist you join
us for breakfast.

14:16.555 --> 14:19.764
This guy is the greatest
breakfast chef in the world.

14:19.892 --> 14:22.202
Oh, you know, I'm not
really into breakfast foods.

14:22.628 --> 14:24.505
Really? Your purse is
shaped like a waffle.

14:24.797 --> 14:26.572
Is it?
Please join us.

14:26.632 --> 14:29.169
The Gergiches don't take
no for an answer. Mmm-mmm.

14:29.335 --> 14:30.541
(SIGHS) Okay.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.081
(LAUGHS) Come on in.

14:33.272 --> 14:35.582
Girls, we've got company.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.517
So, you want to
get out of here?

14:42.314 --> 14:44.089
Work just started,
Ms. Meagle.

14:44.350 --> 14:46.660
Yeah, but our work is just beginning.
You know what I'm saying?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.630
Oh, Donna, who's
the new boy toy?

14:48.687 --> 14:50.360
I'm Taylor,
the new intern.

14:50.422 --> 14:52.231
This is the new intern?
Are you kidding me?

14:52.291 --> 14:54.293
Yeah, he went to high school
with my sister, Natalie.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.236
He was a big deal
on the football team.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.667
Oh, meathead jock
type, huh?

14:59.732 --> 15:01.905
Actually, I quit
football senior year

15:02.001 --> 15:03.742
so I could help my pastor
run a homeless shelter.

15:03.836 --> 15:06.840
Oh. (SIGHS) This guy loves the homeless
so much, he should marry them, right?

15:07.273 --> 15:09.412
Anybody would be
lucky to marry him.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.113
Hey, Taylor, do you want
to marry me and April?

15:11.176 --> 15:13.452
Wish I could, man,
but I'm not a "marriage" dude.

15:13.646 --> 15:14.886
I've got a lot
of love to give,

15:14.980 --> 15:16.425
and it just seems unfair
to put boundaries on it.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.421
He gets it.

15:18.684 --> 15:19.856
DONNA: (WHISPERS)
You so get it.

15:23.856 --> 15:24.926
Oh, hey.

15:24.990 --> 15:28.494
Hi. Should I keep
walking towards you?

15:28.627 --> 15:31.938
Yeah, I could stop,
and you could walk.

15:32.531 --> 15:34.636
Or you know what,
we could meet in the middle.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.040
Great plan.

15:39.405 --> 15:40.713
Hello.
Hi.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.014
(sums)

15:48.380 --> 15:49.415
Well...
Okay.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.234
Ron, ask me if I'm sad.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.162
No.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.430
Ron, I'm the new Jerry.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.501
Well, is whining going to
do anything about it?

16:04.630 --> 16:07.338
You don't want to be a whipping boy.
Stand up for yourself.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.812
You don't understand, Ron.
I already was Jerry.

16:11.236 --> 16:14.012
I was a skinny Indian kid in
South Carolina, and it sucked.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.483
It took me 12 years,
but I reinvented myself.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.986
I'm a business owner.
I wear dope suits.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.888
I have fur underwear.
It was all for nothing.

16:21.947 --> 16:23.426
I'm back to
being a Jerry.

16:23.482 --> 16:24.483
(sums)

16:24.583 --> 16:25.687
All right.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.061
I'm gonna go buy some sweatpants
and a Nicholas Sparks novel.

16:28.454 --> 16:29.762
Might as well lean into it.

16:31.156 --> 16:33.568
RON: <i>Tom can take care of himself.
He's a grown man.</i>

16:34.360 --> 16:35.430
Well, half-grown.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.632
He does have a business

16:36.695 --> 16:38.470
where he rents out his clothes
to 12-year-olds.

16:39.298 --> 16:41.938
ALL GERGICHES:
<i>♪ Eggs, bacon, and toast</i>

16:42.401 --> 16:44.779
<i>♪ Eggs, bacon, and toast</i>

16:45.170 --> 16:47.047
<i>♪ Why don't you start your day</i>

16:47.106 --> 16:50.485
<i>a“ The Gergich way with eggs,
bacon, and...</i>

16:54.313 --> 16:56.293
Oh. Me? Toast...

16:56.415 --> 16:58.759
<i>♪ Eggs, bacon, and toast</i>

16:59.351 --> 17:01.729
<i>♪ Eggs, bacon, and toast</i>

17:01.787 --> 17:03.562
<i>♪ Why don't you start your day</i>

17:03.622 --> 17:05.499
<i>♪ The Gergich way with</i>

17:05.557 --> 17:06.592
<i>♪ Eggs, bacon, and...</i>

17:06.692 --> 17:07.693
<i>♪ Toast ♪</i>

17:07.792 --> 17:09.136
(ALL CHEERING)

17:10.329 --> 17:11.433
Very good.

17:11.497 --> 17:12.669
We sing that
every morning.

17:12.731 --> 17:16.109
But it's an extra treat because
you're here to sing it with us.

17:16.167 --> 17:17.442
JERRY: Mmm-hmm.
Thanks, guys.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.710
Jerry, I wanted your last
day at work to be special,

17:19.771 --> 17:21.217
and I feel like
I let you down.

17:21.272 --> 17:26.244
So I made you this scrapbook
with nearly four amazing pages

17:26.310 --> 17:28.985
jam-packed with memories of
your time in the government.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.858
Oh, my God... Well, look.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.793
Oh, honey.

17:33.852 --> 17:37.095
You look great in
every one of these.

17:37.156 --> 17:42.265
You are still the most handsome
man in the world to me.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.499
Ugh! Mom, come on.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.299
Yeah, geez, Mom.
We're eating.

17:46.365 --> 17:48.709
You know,
it doesn't make any sense.

17:48.767 --> 17:49.768
(ALL LAUGHING)

17:49.868 --> 17:52.815
Leslie, that is
really sweet of you,

17:52.871 --> 17:55.078
but you don't have
to worry about me.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.746
I'm great. Here. I want
to show you something.

17:57.943 --> 17:59.081
Okay.

17:59.778 --> 18:00.779
Whoa!

18:01.246 --> 18:03.283
You also dropped that,
clumsy.

18:06.785 --> 18:07.991
Where am I?

18:09.054 --> 18:12.866
I know I didn't achieve all my work
goals, but, Leslie, I don't care

18:13.092 --> 18:15.936
because for me, the best part about
working in the Parks Department

18:15.994 --> 18:19.874
was that I got to be home every
night with my family at 5:00.

18:20.299 --> 18:22.108
And to me,
that's what mattered most.

18:23.969 --> 18:25.471
Little Sebastian...
Wow!

18:25.704 --> 18:28.548
Jerry, thank you for
sharing this with me.

18:29.074 --> 18:30.382
I...

18:31.743 --> 18:33.086
You have a wonderful life.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.179
Mmm-hmm.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.581
Oh!

18:35.848 --> 18:36.849
Group hug.

18:37.416 --> 18:40.260
Oh, here they are. The hug
machine is here. (ALL LAUGH)

18:41.553 --> 18:46.161
Vroom, vroom, vroom. The hug machine...
It's firing on all cylinders.

18:48.927 --> 18:51.669
Okay, I think we should be
adults and talk about this.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.304
I would love to.

18:53.365 --> 18:55.242
I was nervous
after yesterday

18:55.300 --> 18:57.302
because I was thinking
what does this mean for us?

18:57.369 --> 18:59.406
Not as parents,
but as Chris and Ann?

18:59.471 --> 19:02.213
I don't think on-again, off-again
is a great parental model.

19:02.274 --> 19:04.015
Well, I completely agree.

19:04.109 --> 19:06.589
But if there is
a hypothetical chance

19:06.645 --> 19:09.751
that we could provide
a home with two parents

19:09.815 --> 19:11.522
who are hypothetically
together, then that

19:11.583 --> 19:13.460
could be even better.
Hypothetically.

19:13.719 --> 19:17.565
Of course. We should discuss and
consider all the possibilities.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.837
The most important thing
for me and I think for you

19:21.360 --> 19:22.634
is that we have a child.

19:22.728 --> 19:25.106
And I don't want to do
anything to jeopardize that.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.771
Do you want to make out?
I really do.

19:32.271 --> 19:33.614
Hey.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.118
What are you doing here, Jerry?
I thought you were fired.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.121
I wasn't fired.
I retired.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.315
That's what they all say.

19:39.378 --> 19:41.153
I asked Jerry
to come in.

19:41.213 --> 19:44.251
That new intern wasn't working
out, so I got rid of him.

19:44.316 --> 19:47.627
Once again, I object in the
strongest possible terms.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.761
Once again, noted.

19:49.821 --> 19:53.064
I have also asked Jerry to
come in a couple hours a week

19:53.125 --> 19:55.298
until we find
a permanent replacement.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.703
(GROANS) Just when
we were rid of him?

19:56.762 --> 19:57.832
Yeah, I don't know, Ron.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.170
Are you hearing me, son?

19:59.231 --> 20:01.711
Jerry will come in
once a week,

20:01.767 --> 20:03.440
and everyone will get
to watch him eat

20:03.502 --> 20:07.211
and talk to him about anything
he might do or say or fart.

20:08.140 --> 20:10.211
Welcome back, Jerry.
JERRY: Oh, thank you.

20:10.409 --> 20:12.912
It feels good
just to be back...

20:13.145 --> 20:14.419
(ANDY LAUGHS)

20:15.280 --> 20:16.657
ANDY: Classic new guy.

20:17.182 --> 20:19.594
I'm sorry that I spent
your day off with Jerry

20:19.651 --> 20:21.562
instead of relaxing with you.
It's all right.

20:21.620 --> 20:23.759
And after you fell asleep
making Jerry's scrapbook,

20:23.822 --> 20:27.326
I went back to Season 1 of
Fringe to check for plot holes.

20:27.793 --> 20:29.739
As I suspected, airtight.

20:30.596 --> 20:34.169
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.
I love my job.

20:34.466 --> 20:37.037
But in the blink of an eye,
I'm gonna be retiring,

20:37.102 --> 20:39.605
you know, and flying
off on Marine One

20:39.705 --> 20:41.343
with you and
a Secret Service detail.

20:42.307 --> 20:45.550
Achievements are great,
but I want more than that.

20:45.711 --> 20:47.622
I want what Jerry has.

20:49.715 --> 20:51.820
I mean,
we're always gonna work,

20:51.950 --> 20:54.089
but I think we need to
fill this scrapbook too.

20:55.053 --> 20:56.896
Maybe we should
take a real day off

20:57.022 --> 20:58.865
and talk about
starting our family.

21:00.125 --> 21:02.401
Yeah.
That sounds perfect.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.602
Hey, while you
were over at Jerry's,

21:05.664 --> 21:08.235
did you happen to get any information
about his history with Gayle?

21:08.300 --> 21:10.143
Like, was she
a Russian spy

21:10.202 --> 21:12.978
and the KGB forced her
to marry Jerry as a cover?

21:13.038 --> 21:15.075
You know, it's a mystery, Ben.
Let it go.

21:15.140 --> 21:16.881
Yeah, I can't. It keeps
me awake at night.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.683
Hey, maybe Gayle
has one of those

21:18.744 --> 21:21.520
Oliver Sacks brain
disorder thingies?

21:21.580 --> 21:23.890
Like, does she think
Jerry is a friendly hat?

21:23.949 --> 21:25.223
I think you solved it.
