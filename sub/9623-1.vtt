03:05.419 --> 03:08.022
What are you doing out here?

03:08.122 --> 03:09.390
I'm lost.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.192
This is a restricted area.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.727
Oh, I didn't know that.
There's no signs.

03:13.827 --> 03:17.731
They're everywhere. Let's see some ID.

03:17.831 --> 03:18.833
Why?

03:19.233 --> 03:21.836
There's a broken gate back there,
and you're trespassing.

03:21.936 --> 03:23.273
Excuse me, sir,

03:23.373 --> 03:26.173
that gate was open and I was under
the opinion that this was a detour.

03:26.273 --> 03:28.342
Let me see the ID. Take it out.

03:28.442 --> 03:32.380
- What kind of uniform is that?
- I'll ask the fucking questions.

03:32.480 --> 03:34.934
It's a private outfit, huh?

03:35.482 --> 03:38.152
I tried to get one of those jobs.
I like guarding things.

03:38.452 --> 03:39.685
Really?

03:40.754 --> 03:43.023
Here you go, sir.
I think what must have happened

03:43.123 --> 03:46.691
is I just must have
gotten turned around.

03:51.465 --> 03:55.302
- <i>Is it in the high-end or the low-end range?</i>
- <i>Oh, there's no question it's up!</i>

03:55.702 --> 03:59.673
- <i>Yes, but 20%?</i>
- <i>Foreclosure, foreclosure, foreclosure!</i>

03:59.773 --> 04:01.609
<i>We're talking about over
two-thirds of the market,</i>

04:01.709 --> 04:03.777
<i>and, of course,
it's linked to unemployment.</i>

04:03.877 --> 04:07.148
<i>So, the opportunity for the average
investor with the right know-how...</i>

04:07.248 --> 04:10.719
- <i>Is all in the book. In the seminars.</i>
- <i>Very little doubt?</i>

04:10.819 --> 04:14.155
<i>Yes, their distress sales makes
them want them off the books.</i>

04:14.255 --> 04:17.524
<i>They need to sell them.
They have to, right?</i>

04:20.060 --> 04:22.196
<i>...you name it, we teach them all.</i>

04:22.296 --> 04:25.633
I guesstimate that I have about
50 pounds of copper wire,

04:25.733 --> 04:29.637
100 pounds of chain-link fence and two
manhole covers. The nice thick ones.

04:29.737 --> 04:33.474
I'll give 50 cents a pound for the wire,
15 for the fence, and 10 for the covers.

04:33.574 --> 04:36.677
- That's below market value.
- Market value?

04:36.777 --> 04:39.613
You know the cops came by
asking about manhole covers?

04:39.713 --> 04:42.650
I'd like to counter at a
dollar a pound for the copper,

04:42.750 --> 04:46.487
30 cents a pound for the fence,
and 20 cents per for the covers.

04:46.587 --> 04:50.124
- Sell them somewhere else.
- I'd feel good at 75, 25, and 15.

04:50.224 --> 04:51.625
I'm not negotiating with you.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.525
- I think we're close.
- I'm done.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.937
I'm willing to take less to
establish a business relationship.

05:03.037 --> 05:05.472
If that's your last best offer,
then I guess I accept.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.305
All right. Drive around
back and unload them.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.610
Excuse me, sir?

05:13.046 --> 05:14.348
I'm looking for a job.

05:14.848 --> 05:18.419
In fact, I've made up my mind to find a
career that I can learn and grow into.

05:18.619 --> 05:21.322
Who am I? I'm a hard-worker,
I set high goals

05:21.422 --> 05:24.825
and I've been told that I am persistent.
Now, I'm not fooling myself, sir.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.695
Having been raised with the self-esteem
movement so popular in schools,

05:27.795 --> 05:29.363
I used to expect my
needs to be considered.

05:29.463 --> 05:32.386
But I know that today's work culture
no longer caters to the job loyalty

05:32.486 --> 05:34.501
that could be promised
to earlier generations.

05:34.601 --> 05:38.172
What I believe, sir, is that good things
come to those who work their asses off.

05:38.272 --> 05:40.356
And that people such as yourself,
who reach the top of the mountain,

05:40.456 --> 05:41.975
didn't just fall there.

05:42.075 --> 05:45.613
My motto is if you wanna win the lottery,
you have to make the money to buy a ticket.

05:47.247 --> 05:49.214
Did I say that I worked in a garage?

05:51.252 --> 05:55.189
So, what do you say? I could start
tomorrow, or even why not tonight?

05:55.289 --> 05:56.688
No.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.367
How about an internship then?

06:07.467 --> 06:09.637
A lot of young people are taking unpaid
positions to get a foot in the door.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.638
That's something I'd be willing to do.

06:11.738 --> 06:14.372
I'm not hiring a fucking thief.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.776
This thing's gonna blow!

06:48.876 --> 06:50.808
Crap! Gotta move!

06:54.848 --> 06:56.147
Help!

07:03.341 --> 07:06.093
This thing is not budging. Hold on.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.794
I can't move!

07:20.307 --> 07:21.973
Let's go. Let's go!

07:25.979 --> 07:27.345
Let's go!

07:29.649 --> 07:33.053
- We're first!
- No shit! Get a shot on the other side!

07:33.153 --> 07:34.855
All right, all right.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.723
Get a shot inside the car.

07:42.195 --> 07:45.463
Go around. Get inside the car.
The fuck am I paying you for?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.073
Yeah, it's free.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.541
- Get back, Loder. Get back!
- I'm back, I'm back, I'm back!

07:58.245 --> 08:01.913
All units. EMS, just past exit 31.

08:21.201 --> 08:22.936
Excuse me.

08:23.236 --> 08:27.240
- Will this be on television?
- Morning news. If it bleeds, it leads.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.911
- What channel?
- Whoever pays the most.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.544
What do you get for something like this?

08:34.981 --> 08:36.313
Not nearly enough.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.890
Enough to buy all that gear.

08:42.990 --> 08:46.991
Let me tell you something.
It's a flaming asshole of a job.

08:47.828 --> 08:50.462
Can I ask you, are you currently hiring?

08:51.765 --> 08:53.467
Fuck, no.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.762
Well,

08:55.862 --> 08:58.788
thank you for taking the time to discuss
what you do. You've been very helpful.

08:58.888 --> 09:00.674

- <i>Okay, I give up. Potatoes!</i>

<i>This is CBS2 News at 6:00 a.m.</i>

<i>Coverage you can count on.</i>

10:18.952 --> 10:21.288
<i>Good morning, everyone.
Thanks for joining us. I'm Pat Harvey.</i>

10:21.388 --> 10:23.724
<i>Hope your day's getting off to

- <i>The question is, is it yours?</i>
- <i>We'll have the numbers, coming up.</i>

10:33.867 --> 10:36.337
<i>Evidence has police hunting

<i>but somehow managed to
escape with her life,</i>

<i>thanks to the bravery of a
couple of CHP officers.</i>

11:05.565 --> 11:09.236
<i>The crash started a fire that then
quickly consumed the entire vehicle.</i>

11:09.336 --> 11:13.841
<i>And as we see in this dramatic video,
CHP officers Mike Tilly and John Wall</i>

11:13.941 --> 11:16.276
<i>risked their lives to

11:16.376 --> 11:20.881
<i>Flores was then transferred to St. Joseph's

<i>after suffering smoke inhalation.</i>

12:03.657 --> 12:06.560
I don't know. I'll give you $500.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.730
This is a custom racing bicycle, sir.
Designed for competitive road cycling.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.599
This bike has a light-weight,
space-age carbon frame

12:12.699 --> 12:16.136
and handlebars positioned to put the
rider in a more aerodynamic posture.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.673
It also has micro-shifters and 37 gears,
and weighs under six pounds.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.875
I won the Tour de Mexico on this bike.

12:21.975 --> 12:24.508
$700 is as high as I'll go.

12:25.312 --> 12:28.181
- It cost me over $8,000 new.
- $700.

12:28.281 --> 12:32.083
- $2,500, and that's giving it away.
- No bike has got 37 gears.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.821
$2,000.

12:35.221 --> 12:36.053
No.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.358
- Could I please speak to your boss?
- I'm the owner.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.963
How about $800 in store credit?

12:46.633 --> 12:48.001
What are you after?

12:48.501 --> 12:51.035

13:40.787 --> 13:42.523
- Freelance!
- What are you doing?

13:42.623 --> 13:45.423
- Filming for TV.
- No. Back away.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.829
- What's happening?
- I said turn around and leave.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.364
I'm fairly certain
I'm allowed to film this.

13:51.464 --> 13:54.034
- Film what?
- I don't know. What's happening?

13:54.134 --> 13:57.003
Walk away, or get
arrested for obstruction.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.839
- Yes, Officer.
- Hurry up. Get out of here.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.445
Blow, blow, blow, blow blow.
Almost. Almost.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.714
Will you move that cam?
Man, you better back up.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.316

All right, let's get some blood pressure.
He's pretty shocked.

14:49.255 --> 14:50.557
Breathing is very shallow.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.660
- He's got a second chest wound here.
- Put pressure on it.

14:52.760 --> 14:54.961
We got it. Strap it on the other side.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.329
- You got a dressing on it?
- Yeah.

14:56.429 --> 15:00.233
- GCS is 1-1-1, guys.
- Give me pressure.

15:00.333 --> 15:04.070
- 90 over 60.
- No radial pulse.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.338
We're losing him.

15:05.438 --> 15:07.438
- He's bleeding out.
- Can you bag him?

15:09.943 --> 15:11.478
Let's start bagging him.
Keep on high flow, too.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.980
Yep.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.949
- I got no pulse here.
- Unresponsive.

15:16.049 --> 15:18.318
Get back. You. Get back.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.084
Get the fuck back now.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.424
Okay. Shit. All right.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.594
Get back, 100 feet back, now.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.927
You get back, too. 100 feet.

15:30.830 --> 15:31.999
Fucking asshole, you shut it down.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.334
I had a great fucking angle back
there until you crowded in.

15:34.434 --> 15:38.669
Get the fuck home. There's people trying
to do their fucking job. Fucking asshole.

15:41.775 --> 15:44.611
Yeah. It's Ace Video. Your lead's
gonna be at First and Western.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.714
Yeah, you wanna get there.
It's a shooting.

15:47.814 --> 15:50.517
Yeah, I got some great footage
of a victim being treated.

15:50.617 --> 15:54.035
No, the LAPD hasn't released it but a
manager at a Walgreens says it's a carjacking

15:54.135 --> 15:58.291
and the victim is the owner.
He's Asian and critical. Right.

15:58.391 --> 16:01.825
Look, I got a 60-second cut
with the manager and a neighbor.

16:02.795 --> 16:06.366
$500. Then, make me a deal. $400.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.799
$300. All right, deal.

16:10.870 --> 16:13.057
Are you fucking kidding me?

16:13.157 --> 16:14.998
Get out of here.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.154
Okay, dip into graphics.

17:01.254 --> 17:03.023
I don't think that's going to cover it.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.155
Frank, it's not my call.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.358
Oh, excuse me.

17:09.963 --> 17:13.931
- Excuse me. I have video footage.
- Down the hall, to the right.

17:18.805 --> 17:20.073
- Right here.
- Okay.

17:20.173 --> 17:23.009
Put the neighbor here, and the kids
with their mother by the door.

17:23.108 --> 17:24.944
- You can get it back from 2:16.
- Yeah.

17:25.045 --> 17:28.181
Then I want to lay in some nat-sound.
Let's loop the neighbor's dog barking.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.881
And then try taking the
crying kid from B-roll

17:30.981 --> 17:33.486
- and dropping that in the background.
- Got it.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.921
You my fill-in operator?

17:35.021 --> 17:38.658
I don't think so. I'm Lou Bloom.
I have some footage for sale.

17:38.758 --> 17:39.593
A stringer?

17:40.093 --> 17:42.493
- What?
- Who do you work for?

17:45.165 --> 17:46.700
At the moment, I work for myself.

17:47.300 --> 17:50.036
Okay, see Frank out there,
the way you came.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.670
- What's it timed to?
- 1:06.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.306
What do you have?

17:57.977 --> 18:00.180
Something I'm fairly certain
you'll be very excited about.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.915
What is it?

18:02.015 --> 18:05.018
It's a shooting. A man was shot.
Several times, in fact.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.221
He's lying on the ground,
and he's bleeding on the ground.

18:08.021 --> 18:09.722
I'd be surprised if
he survived, honestly.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.723
- He was shot during a carjacking.
- Western and First?

18:13.493 --> 18:16.763
- Yes, that's right.
- We're getting that from Ace.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.065
I was there. I was much
closer to what happened.

18:20.366 --> 18:23.334
Okay. Okay. Let's see it.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.105
You can fast forward through this.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.312
Keep going, keep going.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.614
<i>Walk away, or I'll arrest you for...</i>

18:34.714 --> 18:36.514
A minute-and-a-half in.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.288
There.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.921
- I got no pulse...
- Oh, fuck.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.393
I need you to see something.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.705
- Yeah?
- Lou Bloom.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.408
Frank Kruse, our assignment editor.
Play it back.

19:05.178 --> 19:06.510
<i>I got no pulse, here.</i>

19:08.814 --> 19:12.185
That's the lead. I want to break it up
and do a wrap-around from the scene.

19:12.785 --> 19:15.388
I want a walking stand-up,
teaser at five, repeat on the half

19:15.488 --> 19:17.023
and I want the copy to
start with a warning.

19:17.123 --> 19:18.158
You're going to show this?

19:18.258 --> 19:19.993
- With a warning.
- It's excessive.

19:20.093 --> 19:21.961
We should have packages
like this every day.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.965
- People are eating breakfast.
- And they'll talk about it at work.

19:25.065 --> 19:27.467
Tie it in with the carjacking
last month in Glendale.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.737
And the other one, the van in Palms.
When was that? In March?

19:30.837 --> 19:33.439
- March, yeah.
- It's a carjacking crime wave.

19:33.539 --> 19:37.128
That's the banner. Call the
victim's family, get a quote, mic it.

19:37.228 --> 19:39.756
- You know what to do.
- Yeah.

19:40.646 --> 19:41.715
How much?

19:42.015 --> 19:43.850
I'm selling this
particular piece for $1,000.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.686
Not even close. This late,
you have nowhere else to go.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.688
And the quality's for shit.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.957
I'll give you $250,
that's the most I'll do.

19:51.057 --> 19:52.256
Now, let's get you paid.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.437
Here you go. Buy yourself
some better equipment,

19:57.537 --> 19:59.866
a directional mic,
and get interviews when you can.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.469
- You have a good eye.
- Thank you.

20:02.569 --> 20:05.138
I'm just beginning, so praise
from someone such as yourself,

20:05.238 --> 20:07.006
well, you can imagine
that it means quite a lot.

20:07.106 --> 20:11.511
I'll help in any way I can. And, of course,
you can help me by calling us first.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.713
I want you to contact me
when you have something.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.348
- Something like this.
- That's right.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.950
Bloody.

20:17.050 --> 20:21.020
Well, that's only part of it.
We like crime. Not all crime.

20:21.120 --> 20:24.857
Carjacking in Compton, for example.
That isn't news, now is it?

20:24.957 --> 20:30.263
We find our viewers are more interested
in urban crime creeping into the suburbs.

20:30.363 --> 20:35.368
What that means is a victim, or victims,
preferably well-off and white,

20:35.468 --> 20:38.338
injured at the hands of
the poor or a minority.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.772
Just crime.

20:39.872 --> 20:43.610
No. Accidents play. Cars,
busses, trains, planes. Fires.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.542
But bloody.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.181
Well, graphic.

20:48.281 --> 20:51.184
The best and clearest way
that I can phrase it to you, Lou,

20:51.284 --> 20:53.720
to capture the spirit of what we air,

20:53.820 --> 20:56.356
is think of our newscast
as a screaming woman

20:56.456 --> 20:58.522
running down the street
with her throat cut.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.494
I understand.

21:01.794 --> 21:05.062
I'm a very, very quick learner.
You will be seeing me again.

21:05.731 --> 21:06.964

- Louis. Sit down.

what the job was.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.228

for some lucky someone.

24:24.830 --> 24:26.766
Okay.

I'd like to know about your prior
employment and hear, in your own words,

24:30.169 --> 24:32.911
what you learned from each position.

24:33.011 --> 24:34.513
My old jobs?

24:36.008 --> 24:39.378
I did landscaping for a couple months.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.942
Like, mow, blow, and go.

24:44.150 --> 24:47.617

hay fever, so I quit.

24:48.688 --> 24:50.423

I don't know.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.263

24:59.799 --> 25:01.434
- Okay.
- Go.

Okay.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.411

25:13.612 --> 25:16.549
I'll do pretty much anything.
That's me. Hire Rick.

25:16.649 --> 25:17.681
So...

25:18.618 --> 25:20.684
What's your address, Richard?

25:21.053 --> 25:24.023
I don't have one.
Not a permanent one right now.

25:24.123 --> 25:27.193
- You're homeless.
- I was for a while.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.695
- You trick.
- Work the street? No.

25:29.795 --> 25:32.465
- Wasn't a question.
- I'm straight.

25:32.565 --> 25:35.468

25:35.568 --> 25:37.136
Yeah.

25:37.236 --> 25:40.239

- Yeah. I grew up all around here.

25:40.339 --> 25:43.607
- Can you start tonight?
- Doing what?

25:46.679 --> 25:50.016
I run a successful TV news business.

25:50.416 --> 25:51.985
We film breaking stories.

25:52.685 --> 25:55.522

morning of a fatal carjacking.

25:56.022 --> 25:59.592
No. I don't have a TV,
but that sounds cool.

25:59.692 --> 26:00.993
Do you have a cellphone?

26:01.093 --> 26:02.459
Yeah.

26:03.462 --> 26:05.231
- Does it have GPS?
- Yes, it does.

26:05.331 --> 26:08.932
- Congratulations. You're hired.
- Okay.

26:10.403 --> 26:12.772
Your job will be to listen
to the emergency radio,

26:12.872 --> 26:17.140
learn police codes,
help navigate, and watch the car.

26:17.810 --> 26:18.742
Okay.

26:19.178 --> 26:22.045
- And what does it pay?
- It's an internship.

26:24.784 --> 26:27.253
Man, I...

26:27.353 --> 26:30.489
I can't do that. I need money.

26:30.589 --> 26:34.727
I'm giving you a chance to explore career
options and get insight into my organization.

26:34.827 --> 26:38.531

full-time job offers to my interns.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.442
Okay, first of all, Richard,

30:10.542 --> 30:14.414
don't answer me by telling me a problem.
I have enough of those already.

30:14.514 --> 30:16.817

can make a decision together.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.684
Okay. Maybe if you didn't rush me.

30:23.689 --> 30:27.093
Don't rush you. Okay. I can use that.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.962
See, Rick, they've done studies

30:30.062 --> 30:34.033
and they found that in any system that
relies on cooperation from a school of fish,

30:34.133 --> 30:36.469
say, or even a professional
hockey team, for example,

30:36.569 --> 30:39.338
these experts have
identified communication

30:39.438 --> 30:42.105
as the number one single key to success.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.782
You know what "fear" stands for?

30:53.385 --> 30:56.086

Get out of your head, Rick.
It's a bad neighborhood.

31:03.629 --> 31:06.098
Now, when you get a chance,
I'd like to know where we're going.

31:06.198 --> 31:08.708
Left on Third. Six blocks.

31:14.940 --> 31:18.477
Find a more appropriate place to park
the car, and don't get blocked in.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.379
Are you the one that made the call?

31:20.479 --> 31:21.714
No, no. I think...

31:21.814 --> 31:24.683
I was trying to go to sleep,
and I heard a sound.

31:24.783 --> 31:26.685
It scared me. That's why I called.

31:26.785 --> 31:30.053
- Sir, what's going on?
- Who the fuck are you?

31:35.527 --> 31:38.998
- TV news. What happened?
- It was a shooting.

31:39.198 --> 31:43.233
I told the cops that he was waving a gun
last week, but they didn't fucking care.

31:44.036 --> 31:46.238
Can you try one more
time without swearing?

31:46.338 --> 31:49.575
- I'm not doing it again.
- But this is for TV.

31:49.775 --> 31:51.577
Yeah? I don't have a TV.

32:01.853 --> 32:03.422
It's over.

32:03.522 --> 32:05.455
Shot the place to shit.

32:13.733 --> 32:16.435
All right, guys, pack it up.
Let's move it out.

32:16.535 --> 32:20.403

we could. Through that window there.

Oh, that's a great piece of tape.

33:36.381 --> 33:39.685
- You didn't get an interview with the couple?
- I have footage of them.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.754
I have an interview with a neighbor.
She curses, but you can cut that out.

33:42.854 --> 33:44.756
How did you get inside the house?

33:44.856 --> 33:46.725
- The door was open.
- They allowed you?

33:46.825 --> 33:49.328
I heard somebody yell to come in,
and when nobody was inside, I left.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.297
And the only shot of the couple
is through a window?

33:51.497 --> 33:53.825
- The police were shutting it down.
- I don't like it.

33:53.925 --> 33:56.201
- Like what?
- The footage looks like he broke in.

33:56.301 --> 33:58.738
There's no close-up of the homeowners
and he's giving us their name

33:58.838 --> 34:01.740
- off a piece of private correspondence.
- Excuse me, that's junk mail.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.777
- Well, I have a problem with that.
- We'll knock out a killer package.

34:04.877 --> 34:06.445
- This is my job.
- No!

34:06.545 --> 34:09.715
Your job is writing the tweet of the day.
And getting Deb to turn sideways

34:09.815 --> 34:13.018
during the weather forecast.
We're running it.

34:13.418 --> 34:17.556
I like how you handled Frank.
You didn't soften the truth or dilute it.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.491
I think being clear with your
objectives is more important

34:19.591 --> 34:23.295
than trying to present your ideas
in a non-confrontational manner.

34:23.395 --> 34:27.632
- Do you have experience in an office?
- Myself? Not presently, no.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.635
- Where did you get all that?
- I study a lot online.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.272
- Yeah? Like what?
- All sorts of things, actually.

34:33.371 --> 34:35.290
I'm on my computer all day.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.444
I haven't had what you'd call
much of a formal education,

34:38.543 --> 34:41.139
but you can find most anything
if you look hard enough.

34:48.654 --> 34:52.690
Last year, I took an online
business course, for example.

34:52.791 --> 34:57.629
And I learned that you have to have a
business plan before starting a business.

34:57.729 --> 35:02.865
And that why you pursue something is
equally as important as what you pursue.

35:03.835 --> 35:06.238
The site advised you to...

35:06.638 --> 35:10.142
answer the following question before you
decide where to focus your abilities.

35:10.242 --> 35:14.243
The question was "What do I love to do?"

35:15.180 --> 35:18.083
The site suggested making a list
of your strengths and weaknesses.

35:18.183 --> 35:21.487
What am I good at?
What am I not good at?

35:21.587 --> 35:23.489
Maybe I want to strengthen
and develop knowledge

35:23.589 --> 35:27.390
about the things I'm already good at.
Maybe I want to strengthen my weaknesses.

35:33.265 --> 35:35.408
I recently remade my list.

35:36.735 --> 35:39.004
And I'm thinking

35:39.304 --> 35:41.607
that television news

35:41.907 --> 35:44.810
might just be something I love

35:44.910 --> 35:47.677
as well as something
I happen to be good at.

36:00.725 --> 36:03.359
On TV, it looks so real.

36:04.229 --> 36:06.376
Yes. It does.

36:07.766 --> 36:12.504
Well, I have a show to do.
Your check is at the desk.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.940
Outstanding work, Lou.
Really, just great.

36:15.040 --> 36:17.941
Thanks, Nina. That means an awful lot.

36:19.478 --> 36:20.710
Okay.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.728
<i>It's every parent's nightmare.</i>

36:46.828 --> 36:49.875
<i>Imagine singing a lullaby to your
infant and tucking them into bed</i>

36:49.975 --> 36:51.510
<i>and then having to shield them</i>

36:51.610 --> 36:55.947
<i>as a barrage of high-caliber bullets
literally blast into your home.</i>

36:56.047 --> 36:59.985
<i>For the Cahills of Echo Park,
that fear became a terrifying reality</i>

37:00.085 --> 37:05.221
<i>when an adjacent house became the setting
for a scene right out of the Wild West.</i>

38:28.648 --> 38:32.378
<i>Paying too much at the pump?
Well, sign up for our super saver card</i>

38:32.478 --> 38:35.814
<i>and you'll be saving buckets
of duckets on every purchase.</i>

38:35.914 --> 38:39.251
<i>Takes minutes to sign up

38:39.351 --> 38:41.987
<i>You'll also be eligible

38:42.087 --> 38:45.421
<i>So sign up now and start saving!</i>

39:07.012 --> 39:10.649
Rick, I'm very pleased with how
you progressed. You're doing a great job.

39:10.749 --> 39:13.385
However, you just spilled gasoline
on my car which will eat the paint.

39:13.485 --> 39:16.321
I need you tighten up a bit on this.
Because if you fill it like that again,

39:16.421 --> 39:19.622
I will terminate you immediately,
I promise you.

39:53.825 --> 39:56.728
"Bed, Bath & Beyond."

39:56.828 --> 39:58.861
Oh, that's a good store.

40:01.199 --> 40:04.836
Making peace with what you don't have,
that's what it's all about.

40:05.036 --> 40:09.174
Living with what you ain't got, right?
Don't you think?

40:09.274 --> 40:11.643
<i>Traffic units, ambulance traffic,
Benedict Canyon.</i>

40:11.743 --> 40:15.780
- <i>Overturned vehicle with injuries.</i>
- Crash with injuries. Good neighborhood.

40:19.784 --> 40:21.286
TV news. What happened?

40:21.386 --> 40:24.889
I think it was a head-on collision,
and there's a guy who's dead over there.

40:24.989 --> 40:26.491
- There's a woman...
- Did you see what happened?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.627
Am I supposed to help?
I didn't see, I came after.

40:28.727 --> 40:31.630
- Can you tell me exactly what happened?
- Will you get the camera out of my face?

40:31.730 --> 40:35.164
Get it out! I'm trying to talk to 911!

40:35.700 --> 40:38.634
No, it's at... The guy is down.

42:22.908 --> 42:26.475
Make some room! We'll block it off.

42:37.923 --> 42:40.056
Not getting through here.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.058
Son of a bitch.

42:42.994 --> 42:44.062
Let's go.

42:44.162 --> 42:45.461
Fuck this.

42:48.032 --> 42:49.469
Here you go.

42:53.171 --> 42:56.041
Ben Waterman wears
the same gold tie on Fridays.

42:56.141 --> 42:59.308
We're leading with it.
That's your third start this week.

43:00.545 --> 43:02.514
I'm focusing on framing.

43:02.614 --> 43:06.685
A proper frame not only draws the eye
into a picture but keeps it there longer,

43:06.785 --> 43:10.452
dissolving the barrier between the
subject and the outside of the frame.

43:11.623 --> 43:13.456
Is that blood on your shirt?

43:14.459 --> 43:16.595
I don't think so.

43:16.995 --> 43:20.966
I recently heard of a Mexican restaurant
called Cabanita. Have you heard of it?

43:21.066 --> 43:22.999
It's also on your sleeve.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.402
I didn't see that.

43:28.673 --> 43:31.574
What I'm asking is,
do you like Mexican food, Nina?

43:32.544 --> 43:33.612
Yes.

43:33.712 --> 43:36.414
Stand by, people. Here we go.

43:36.514 --> 43:40.148
Cabanita has been called
"an authentic taste of Mexico City."

43:42.754 --> 43:45.721
Do you wanna go with me?
I think we could have fun together.

43:46.357 --> 43:49.094
- Thanks, but I'm busy.
- Saturday is your night off, isn't it?

43:49.194 --> 43:53.264
I have a rule, Lou.
I don't date people I work with.

43:53.464 --> 43:56.499
- And I'm twice your age.
- I like older women.

43:57.202 --> 43:59.671
Besides, I don't work with you.
You're someone I sell to.

43:59.771 --> 44:02.273
And I don't wanna fuck that up.

44:02.373 --> 44:04.610
What if by saying no, you fuck it up?

44:05.210 --> 44:06.711
All right, 10 seconds to go and back on.

44:06.811 --> 44:08.377
Is that what you're saying?

44:10.215 --> 44:13.548
- I didn't say that.
- Eight, seven...

44:13.648 --> 44:16.521
- ...six, five, four...
- Well, I don't know what to say.

44:16.621 --> 44:18.957
...three, two, one.

44:19.057 --> 44:21.092
Good morning. Thank you
for joining us. I'm Lisa Mays.

44:21.192 --> 44:24.496
And I'm Ben Waterman.
First up on <i>This Morning</i> on KWLA News,

44:24.596 --> 44:28.834
a horrible car crash over in Benedict Canyon.
It's claimed the life now of one man.

44:28.934 --> 44:31.000
Severely injured a young woman.

44:32.871 --> 44:34.523
Hey, Lou!

44:36.107 --> 44:38.877
Hey, man. Joe Loder, Mayhem.

44:38.977 --> 44:43.148
Great get tonight. They were closing
it down by the time we showed up.

44:43.248 --> 44:45.216
Were you waiting for me out here?

44:45.316 --> 44:47.552
No, I was driving by and I saw your car.

44:47.652 --> 44:50.555
You're not dropping your shit off,
are you? Nobody does that.

44:50.655 --> 44:53.091
You need an air card if you
want to be in the game.

44:53.191 --> 44:56.160
Import the video to your laptop.
Cut the video.

44:56.260 --> 44:59.964
Upload to your FTP site and notify
stations you got something for sale.

45:00.064 --> 45:03.866
Boom, boom, boom!
Otherwise, it's a nice ride.

45:04.669 --> 45:08.206
Listen, man, you got a good run going
but there's valleys out there.

45:08.306 --> 45:10.975
Take it from me.
I've been nightcrawling for 14 years.

45:11.075 --> 45:13.778
- You heard I'm adding a second van?
- No. I didn't hear that.

45:13.878 --> 45:16.014
Gonna be a game changer.

45:16.114 --> 45:20.018
Cut my on-scene time in half.
I'm setting up a dedicated dispatch, too.

45:20.118 --> 45:22.821
No more listening and driving.
That's for suckers.

45:22.921 --> 45:26.090
- You like the Canon 305s?
- Never used one.

45:26.190 --> 45:31.797
Six thou a piece. 2.4 megapixels.
Night vision. 18:1 zoom.

45:32.197 --> 45:34.499
I got one of those puppies
with your name on it.

45:34.599 --> 45:35.900
I have a camera.

45:36.000 --> 45:40.205
I want you running my second van.
Two crews. Half the area to cover.

45:40.305 --> 45:43.041
Now, I know what you're thinking.
Half the money, right?

45:43.141 --> 45:45.110
You should be thinking, twice the sales.

45:45.210 --> 45:47.746
Because we're going to be
the first at every scene.

45:47.846 --> 45:50.014
Why compete when we can work together?

45:50.114 --> 45:54.018
You can share my press cards.
Puppy dog off my police connections.

45:54.118 --> 45:57.823
This is the big move, the next level.
We can corner this whole thing.

45:57.923 --> 46:00.491
I'm talking about putting some
heavy digits in our pocket, brah.

46:00.591 --> 46:03.795
Thank you for offering me the position
but working for myself is

46:03.895 --> 46:05.795
more in line with my skills
and career goals.

46:08.566 --> 46:10.835
- Take a few days to think about it.
- No.

46:10.935 --> 46:13.438
You'll need to hire someone else,
and I don't want to hold up the process.

46:13.538 --> 46:15.473
You want to be on
the inside of this, man

46:15.573 --> 46:18.309
because I'm going to be
tag-teaming every call.

46:18.409 --> 46:23.548
You keep talking like it's something that
I may be interested in, but I'm not.

46:23.648 --> 46:25.950
You don't even understand the offer.

46:26.050 --> 46:28.419
If you did, you'd be
fucking sucking my dick!

46:28.519 --> 46:31.690
You'd be asking me questions.
What does this mean? What does that mean?

46:31.790 --> 46:35.393
I feel like grabbing you
by your ears right now

46:35.493 --> 46:40.262
and screaming in your face,
"I'm not fucking interested."

46:41.900 --> 46:45.234
Instead, I'm going to drive home
and do some accounting.

46:49.107 --> 46:52.441
Fuck you! Twerp.

47:04.989 --> 47:07.226
I didn't wake up until 5:00.

47:08.126 --> 47:11.827
My body is so off,
I feel like it's time for breakfast.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.136
I bet you're beautiful
any time of the day.

47:18.336 --> 47:20.872
In fact, I'd say

47:20.972 --> 47:23.263
you're much prettier than Lisa Mays.

47:25.510 --> 47:29.445
I like the dark makeup on your eyes.
I also like the way you smell.

47:32.250 --> 47:34.083
So, where you from, Lou?

47:36.054 --> 47:38.553
The north end of the Valley.

47:39.157 --> 47:40.892
Some of the calls
sometimes take me over there,

47:40.992 --> 47:45.597
but nobody I know still lives out there.
You're from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

47:45.897 --> 47:47.799
How did you know that?

47:48.099 --> 47:49.584
It's online.

47:50.635 --> 47:53.540
Everything about you is online.
Not everything, but definitely a lot.

47:54.305 --> 47:56.241
I've watched all the videos
from when you were a reporter.

47:56.341 --> 47:57.675
I'm sure you look at those, of course.

47:57.775 --> 48:00.609
No. God, no.
Not without a drink in my hand.

48:01.913 --> 48:04.215
I watch my work all the time.

48:04.315 --> 48:07.382
- Yeah? Do you want to become a reporter?
- No.

48:08.119 --> 48:11.489
- Most of you guys want air time.
- Not me.

48:11.589 --> 48:14.626
I want to be the guy that owns
the station that owns the camera.

48:15.126 --> 48:19.297
The business is going well,
but in order to grow to the next level,

48:19.397 --> 48:21.967
I need to stay one step ahead
of my competition and take risks.

48:22.267 --> 48:24.500
I also need financial support
to implement expansion.

48:26.537 --> 48:28.137
Would you like another margarita?

48:29.340 --> 48:30.773
One is enough.

48:31.609 --> 48:33.742
Thanks for coming out to talk.

48:34.412 --> 48:35.780
The place I'm in now

48:35.880 --> 48:40.551
is that I want a relationship
with someone I can team up with

48:40.651 --> 48:43.221
and share, like we share,
the same job and hours and whatnot.

48:43.321 --> 48:45.356
I could go down a laundry list,
but you get the idea.

48:45.556 --> 48:49.191
Yes. Well, I hope you find someone.

48:50.661 --> 48:52.598
Here's the thing about that, Nina.

48:53.398 --> 48:55.459
I'm quite certain I already have.

48:57.969 --> 48:59.335
Okay.

49:00.238 --> 49:02.273
Let me put this politely.

49:02.373 --> 49:07.309
I only came out to dinner with you, Lou,
purely as a professional courtesy.

49:09.413 --> 49:10.989
Thank you.

49:12.984 --> 49:15.120
I don't think it's any secret
that I've single-handedly raised

49:15.220 --> 49:17.286
the unit price of your ratings book.

49:19.057 --> 49:22.495
Our ratings book price?

49:24.662 --> 49:26.164
I'm a very fast learner.

49:26.264 --> 49:29.131
We had a conversation where I specifically
mentioned that. Do you remember that?

49:31.002 --> 49:33.538
- Well, do you?
- Yes.

49:33.638 --> 49:36.276
I recently learned,
for instance, that...

49:36.376 --> 49:39.541
most Americans watch
local news to stay informed.

49:40.711 --> 49:43.781
I also learned that the average half-hour
of Los Angeles television news

49:43.881 --> 49:47.415
packs all of its local government coverage
including law enforcement,

49:47.515 --> 49:51.756
budget, transportation, education
and immigration into 22 seconds.

49:51.856 --> 49:54.759
Local crime stories, however,
not only usually led the news

49:54.859 --> 49:57.896
but filled 14 times the broadcast,
averaging five minutes and seven seconds.

49:57.996 --> 50:01.165
KWLA relies heavily on such stories.

50:01.365 --> 50:04.681
With Los Angeles crime rates going down,
I think that makes items like mine

50:04.781 --> 50:08.070
particularly valuable.
Like rare animals.

50:09.240 --> 50:12.308
I can imagine that your needs will increase
during next month's rating sweeps period.

50:19.183 --> 50:23.418
Yeah. Well, we certainly
appreciate what you do.

50:29.560 --> 50:32.361
There's certain good things
about being alone.

50:35.299 --> 50:38.503
You have time to do the things you
wanna do, like study and plan, but...

50:38.603 --> 50:41.072
you can't have dinners like this
or be physical with a person.

50:41.172 --> 50:43.605
I mean, outside of flirtation-ship.

50:45.643 --> 50:47.676
Where are you going with this?

50:49.714 --> 50:51.380
I want that.

50:53.284 --> 50:54.817
With you.

50:57.588 --> 51:00.522
Like you want to keep your job
and your health insurance.

51:02.660 --> 51:05.229
Look, just for starters,

51:05.329 --> 51:08.233
I don't need you to keep my fucking job.

51:08.933 --> 51:11.869
You're the news director
on the vampire shift

51:11.969 --> 51:16.265
of the lowest-rated
station in Los Angeles.

51:18.876 --> 51:22.647
We have what could be considered
an almost-exclusive relationship.

51:22.747 --> 51:25.650
There are many other places I could go.

51:25.750 --> 51:28.586
I have to think that you're
invested in this transaction.

51:28.986 --> 51:30.855
- Here you are.
- Wow.

51:30.955 --> 51:33.021
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

51:36.394 --> 51:40.598
Where did you get the balls to even
suggest something like this?

51:40.698 --> 51:44.102
- We're still talking.
- No. There's nothing more to say.

51:44.202 --> 51:45.834
You can leave.

51:52.376 --> 51:56.614
Okay, look. You've done well. Okay?

51:56.714 --> 52:00.318
And we pay you well, very well.
We always have.

52:00.418 --> 52:04.222
If you like, I could get you
an exclusive retainer.

52:04.922 --> 52:07.258
That would be on top
of your segment fees.

52:07.358 --> 52:11.029
I could maybe even get you a job at the
station starting as a production assistant.

52:11.129 --> 52:13.097
So that you could learn
the business from the inside.

52:13.197 --> 52:15.230
That's where you
said your interests lie.

52:17.268 --> 52:19.267
You're not listening, Nina.

52:20.238 --> 52:22.106
I happen to know that you
haven't stayed at one station

52:22.206 --> 52:26.274
for longer than two years at a time,
and you're coming up on two years soon.

52:28.946 --> 52:31.516
I can imagine that your contract
is for that length of time.

52:31.616 --> 52:34.352
And that next month's ratings
directly affect that.

52:34.452 --> 52:37.588
So, you're threatening
that if I don't...

52:37.688 --> 52:40.324
- I'm negotiating.
- You're threatening to stop selling to me.

52:40.624 --> 52:42.627
That's your choice.

52:42.727 --> 52:45.796
The true price of any item is what
somebody's willing to pay for it.

52:45.896 --> 52:49.533
You want something. And I want you.

52:49.633 --> 52:50.899
To fuck you.

52:51.469 --> 52:53.171
And as a friend.

52:53.471 --> 52:57.473
Jesus Christ, friends don't pressure
friends to fucking sleep with them.

52:58.676 --> 53:01.137
Actually, that's not true, Nina.

53:02.747 --> 53:05.484
Because as I'm sure you know,

53:06.384 --> 53:10.919
a friend is a gift you give yourself.

53:43.321 --> 53:46.524
Okay, a left on Roth,
and then six blocks to the ramp.

53:46.624 --> 53:47.825
You're putting me on the 5?

53:47.925 --> 53:50.261
Yeah, the 2 to the 5
to the 110 to the 10.

53:50.461 --> 53:52.997
Did you read my traffic memo yesterday?

53:53.097 --> 53:54.899
Did I read it?

53:55.199 --> 53:58.436
- Yeah, I read it.
- What did it say?

53:58.536 --> 54:02.039
- About the 5?
- Okay. I looked at it. What?

54:02.139 --> 54:04.542
Well, for one thing, it included that
the 5 has floating construction

54:04.642 --> 54:07.478
in the fast lane for the next three weeks.
So, given that, I expect you to put me

54:07.578 --> 54:09.747
on the 2 to the 101
to the 110 to the 10.

54:10.147 --> 54:13.718
- That's half of one, six of the other.
- It's half dozen of one, six of the other.

54:13.818 --> 54:16.420
What I'd like you to do is admit that
you didn't read what you said you did.

54:16.520 --> 54:19.390
You know I'm a reasonable person,
but nobody likes to be lied to!

54:19.490 --> 54:23.294
Okay! When am I going to get my raise?
That's reasonable, right?

54:23.394 --> 54:25.830
You keep talking about this performance
review. When is it gonna happen?

54:25.930 --> 54:28.933
I've been out here two months already,
busting my ass every night.

54:29.133 --> 54:32.703
I'm tired of your promises for more pay, man.
I'm sleeping in a garage.

54:32.803 --> 54:36.307
Rick, trying to leverage your salary in this
economic environment is near impossible.

54:36.407 --> 54:40.311
Most firms have set starting wages. Ideally,
you could leverage with other offers,

54:40.411 --> 54:43.147
but that's just not the case
in your situation right now.

54:43.247 --> 54:46.083
<i>Test 498. Engine 91.
North division. Battalion 12.</i>

54:46.183 --> 54:48.886
<i>Heavy rescue. 56. Air ops respond.
Reported plane down.</i>

54:48.986 --> 54:51.022
- <i>Whiteman Field, south of Foothill.</i>
- Reroute us to that.

54:51.522 --> 54:54.992
We're, like 22 minutes from Foothill,
and only five from a hit and run.

54:55.092 --> 54:58.627
They're rolling heavy rescue and an
air ambulance. Get me there, please.

55:13.978 --> 55:16.781
It's good right there.
Stay on that spot.

55:16.881 --> 55:18.614
Not getting through here.

55:20.284 --> 55:22.152
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
It's all over here, buddy.

55:22.252 --> 55:24.285
Turn it around, let's go.

55:26.690 --> 55:27.789
You're late.

55:29.393 --> 55:34.065
Hey, brah! Five fatals.
Come screaming out of the fucking sky.

55:34.165 --> 55:38.507
All lit up with the brush on fire.
Mine. Exclusive.

55:38.607 --> 55:40.465
I'm banging!

55:41.138 --> 55:44.208
And my other van is in Carson,
getting the jumper.

55:44.308 --> 55:45.943
You know...

55:46.443 --> 55:50.748
I was trying to hook you up, man.
I was trying to teach you something.

55:53.717 --> 55:56.095
Welcome to the future, brah.

56:11.469 --> 56:12.592
A car crash.

56:13.571 --> 56:16.307
Well, none of this is
gonna knock anybody out.

56:16.407 --> 56:20.108
I can't use any of this in my rundown.
Is this it?

56:21.011 --> 56:24.882
- No, I have a stabbing in Corona.
- Where's the plane crash at Foothill?

56:24.982 --> 56:28.486
I don't mind saying that I'm trying to bring
you stories that happen here on the ground.

56:28.586 --> 56:32.456
- Two has it. It'll be their lead.
- Well, I hope that works well for them.

56:32.556 --> 56:33.958
Now, let me show you
the stabbing in Corona.

56:34.058 --> 56:37.528
I don't give a goddamn
about fucking Corona!

56:37.628 --> 56:42.033
You know how important this week is.
This shit is fucking death to me!

56:42.733 --> 56:46.003
I understand your frustration. I was
just trying not to be too hard on myself.

56:46.203 --> 56:49.273
I sold you upstairs as some
kind of fucking sweeps savior.

56:49.373 --> 56:53.709
And I'm leading with a
goddamn stabbing. In Corona!

56:54.378 --> 56:57.648
- So, you want that, then?
- I want you to get in the goddamn game!

56:57.748 --> 57:00.117
I want something
people can't turn away from.

57:00.217 --> 57:03.084
I want what you fucking promised me!

57:15.032 --> 57:17.435
<i>Good morning, everyone.
Thanks for joining us. I'm Pat Harvey.</i>

57:17.535 --> 57:20.070
<i>Hope your day's getting off to
a good start. I'm Kent Shocknek.</i>

57:20.170 --> 57:23.541
<i>We begin with a tragedy last night
in the foothills of Santa Susana Pass</i>

57:23.641 --> 57:26.343
<i>where a private plane crashed
with no survivors.</i>

57:26.443 --> 57:30.147
<i>CBS2 has obtained this exclusive video.
We want to remind you now</i>

57:30.247 --> 57:34.282
<i>that what you're about to see is graphic,
and viewer discretion is advised.</i>

58:33.243 --> 58:35.646
Since when did Coldwater
become faster than Laurel?

58:35.746 --> 58:38.516
Huh? What was the thinking there?

58:38.916 --> 58:40.384
I didn't ask that to hear myself speak.

58:40.484 --> 58:43.187
Because, you know,
Coldwater only has six lights.

58:43.287 --> 58:46.658
Yeah, but Laurel has places to pass.
I can't get around this person until Ventura.

58:47.458 --> 58:49.627
It's the same argument, man.
I said this route.

58:49.727 --> 58:51.996
If you wanted to take Laurel,
you should have said something.

58:52.096 --> 58:55.299
I thought that you worked in other factors.
If I didn't think that you could do better,

58:55.399 --> 58:57.134
I wouldn't ride you so hard
about the routes.

58:57.234 --> 58:58.736
I think you know that, Rick.

58:58.836 --> 59:01.235
I think it may just be possible that
I have a higher opinion of you

59:01.335 --> 59:03.173
than you have of yourself.

59:04.036 --> 59:05.507
What the fuck? God damn it!

59:08.011 --> 59:09.723
Seriously?

59:10.514 --> 59:14.552
To get to a van crash on Moorpark?
Who cares? What's the rush?

59:15.152 --> 59:18.320
Why aren't we at the rape at
Griffith Park like everybody else?

59:25.629 --> 59:27.523
Oh, fuck!

59:27.623 --> 59:31.068
Oh, fuck me. Oh, God!
That's the fucking Mayhem van.

59:31.168 --> 59:34.605
Joe Loder and the other dude.
What's his name? Fucking Marcus.

59:35.405 --> 59:37.872
Park the car and get your camera.

59:40.277 --> 59:42.379
Now, let's get one guy inside.
Hold the seats back.

59:42.479 --> 59:45.449
- You can't get that in right there?
- No, there's no room.

59:47.518 --> 59:49.151
Here we go.

59:53.857 --> 59:55.945
What the hell happened?

59:56.560 --> 59:59.763
According to witnesses, they were
driving at a high rate of speed,

59:59.963 --> 01:00:02.216
probably toward Griffith Park,
when, apparently,

01:00:02.316 --> 01:00:05.800
they ran head-on into this light pole.
No other car. Single vehicle.

01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:08.772
How did they just run into a pole?

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:17.247
Get that backboard
right up against him. Easy.

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.550
Hey, don't film that, man.
He's one of us.

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:22.820
Not anymore, Rick. We're professionals.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.589
He's a sale.

01:00:24.889 --> 01:00:28.390
Got facial trauma.
Got lacerations all the way down...

01:00:29.226 --> 01:00:31.629
- Yeah, I'm calling it in.
- Minimize that movement.

01:00:31.729 --> 01:00:35.130
Get him back in the ambulance and put
some oxygen on him. Drop him down.

01:00:35.230 --> 01:00:38.002
- Keep pressure on him.
- Back that unit off.

01:00:38.102 --> 01:00:40.652
Yeah, let's get some
four-by-fours on there.

01:00:41.505 --> 01:00:43.741
Bring the gurney all the way up.

01:00:43.841 --> 01:00:45.976
Come on, let's go. Stay with me.

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:47.978
I got him, I got him.

01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:50.478
- Make sure you size him right.
- All right.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.774
Man, we are way the hell out here.

01:01:26.917 --> 01:01:29.787
<i>Any Mission unit.
Residential 211 in progress.</i>

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:33.457
<i>37 Bonhill Road.
Receiving 211 siren activation.</i>

01:01:33.557 --> 01:01:36.560
Armed response on a home invasion.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:38.872
We're five blocks away. Pull a U-turn.

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:51.709
At the end of the street. Coming up.

01:01:51.809 --> 01:01:54.042
4808. Here!

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:00.751
We beat the police.

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:03.018
- What do you want me to do?
- You know what to do, Rick!

01:04:28.432 --> 01:04:30.401
<i>3-X-21. Go ahead.</i>

01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:34.569
<i>3-X-21, confirm address
on the 211 at Bonhill Road.</i>

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:37.901
What is going on?

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:39.369
- We're leaving.
- What?

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:43.240
What's in there? What's going on?
What happened in there?

01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.675
You should have walked in and looked,
Rick, if you're that curious.

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.845
That's what I'm paying you to do.
You need to show initiative.

01:05:47.945 --> 01:05:50.280
There is no better way
to achieve job security

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.849
than by making yourself
an indispensable employee.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:54.084
I heard gunshots!

01:05:54.184 --> 01:05:56.019
All the more reason you
might have helped me.

01:05:56.119 --> 01:05:58.088
You might have learned a new
skill that made you more useful

01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:00.054
and put us on a track toward growth!

01:06:37.794 --> 01:06:38.929
Stay in the car.

01:06:39.029 --> 01:06:41.462
- Why?
- Because I said so.

01:07:28.278 --> 01:07:30.013
We have a hit-and-run in Beverly Hills,

01:07:30.113 --> 01:07:32.916
a car versus pedestrian
incident and a robbery.

01:07:33.016 --> 01:07:35.909
- Do we have footage of the crash?
- Surveillance footage.

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:42.859
I've been trying to reach you
for the last hour.

01:07:42.959 --> 01:07:47.140
In the future, when you don't have anything,
man up and don't dodge my fucking calls.

01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.095
I do have something.

01:07:49.199 --> 01:07:50.934
What?

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:54.538
Home invasion,
triple murder in Granada Hills.

01:07:54.638 --> 01:07:57.838
- That's just breaking now.
- We got there before the police.

01:08:00.143 --> 01:08:01.763
You have it?

01:08:05.082 --> 01:08:07.251
I'm not going to list the many
benefits of this piece.

01:08:07.351 --> 01:08:10.220
I think it's probably best if
you just watch it for yourself.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:12.790
I could have had someone out there
by now. Why didn't you call it in?

01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:15.743
To increase your need,
and improve my bargaining position.

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:19.527
Frank, Jenny! Bay 2, now!

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:50.158
Get Linda in here.

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:03.707
Home invasion in Granada.
He got there before the cops.

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:06.741
We have 10 minutes to airtime.
How much of this can we show?

01:09:07.844 --> 01:09:11.348
- You mean, legally?
- No, morally. Of course, legally.

01:09:11.448 --> 01:09:12.482
Have they been identified?

01:09:12.582 --> 01:09:15.819
It just happened, so you have to assume no,
and that's just one of the issues.

01:09:15.919 --> 01:09:18.955
We can't broadcast their identities
without notifying the next of kin.

01:09:19.055 --> 01:09:21.959
- We're not identifying them.
- You are by proxy, by showing their faces.

01:09:22.059 --> 01:09:23.727
We pixelate the faces.

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.429
- Where did you get this?
- Stringer.

01:09:26.629 --> 01:09:27.698
Hi, Linda. I'm Lou.

01:09:28.098 --> 01:09:30.567
Jesus. Is there a dead
baby inside of there?

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:32.102
No. The crib was empty.

01:09:32.202 --> 01:09:34.969
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Are we breaking the law by showing this?

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:42.028
Block the faces, don't give out the
exact address. Do that, I guess.

01:09:42.127 --> 01:09:45.115
I don't know. I wouldn't think so, no.

01:09:45.215 --> 01:09:47.317
- Journalistically and ethically?
- This isn't Hartford.

01:09:47.417 --> 01:09:51.621
- We are beyond all broadcast standards.
- Have you seen the overnights?

01:09:51.921 --> 01:09:54.924
- I'll risk the fine.
- What did you pay for this?

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.482
The price hasn't been negotiated yet.

01:09:58.327 --> 01:10:00.494
Give us a minute. Thanks.

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:07.837
- How much?
- $100,000.

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:09.940
- How much?
- $50,000.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:12.309
I need a number. Nine minutes.
I need a number.

01:10:12.409 --> 01:10:14.678
- I just gave you two.
- $3,000.

01:10:15.178 --> 01:10:18.148
- I got $3,000 for the food truck stabbings.
- There were more dead.

01:10:18.248 --> 01:10:21.451
Those were poor Mexican people in a
roach coach. Two of them were illegals.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:24.521
These are three wealthy white people,
shot and killed in their mansion.

01:10:24.621 --> 01:10:28.758
Including a suburban housewife
shotgunned in her bed. I know you, Nina.

01:10:28.858 --> 01:10:30.260
I know your interest and
excitement in this product

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.982
is greater than the
amount you're offering.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.671
- $5,000.
- $30,000.

01:10:41.771 --> 01:10:42.705
- $7,000.
- $25,000.

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:43.673
- $8,000.
- $15,000.

01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:45.842
- $9,000.
- $15,000.

01:10:45.942 --> 01:10:47.177
- $10,000.
- $15,000.

01:10:47.277 --> 01:10:50.013
- Give me a serious number.
- $15,000.

01:10:50.113 --> 01:10:53.750
Can't do it. Never happen. There's a matter
of precedent. Ten is my last best offer.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:55.247
Okay.

01:10:55.985 --> 01:10:58.989
Really? Where are you going?

01:10:59.389 --> 01:11:01.758
Seven has approached me
at least several times.

01:11:01.858 --> 01:11:04.679
The ND there gave me his number.
They'll make me a better offer.

01:11:04.779 --> 01:11:07.556
- It's a five-minute drive.
- Hold on!

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:16.573
- Twelve.
- Fifteen.

01:11:16.673 --> 01:11:19.709
I can't spend a month's budget
on a single story.

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:20.908
What if the story's not over?

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:23.780
The people who did this escaped.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:27.450
They're still out there,
walking around with the rest of us.

01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:30.387
If I had a family and I lived in a home,
that might make me nervous.

01:11:30.487 --> 01:11:32.489
I'd want updates on what was going on.

01:11:32.589 --> 01:11:35.809
With this footage, people would
turn to your channel for the story.

01:11:36.326 --> 01:11:39.829
I like you, Nina. And I look
forward to our time together.

01:11:39.929 --> 01:11:44.267
But you have to understand.
$15,000 isn't all that I want.

01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:46.203
From here on, starting now,

01:11:46.303 --> 01:11:48.905
I want my work to be credited
by the anchors and on a burn.

01:11:49.005 --> 01:11:51.809
The name of my company is
Video Production News,

01:11:51.909 --> 01:11:53.610
a professional news-gathering service.

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:56.513
That's how it should be read
and that's how it should be said.

01:11:56.613 --> 01:11:59.683
I also want to go to the next rung,
and meet your team.

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:01.718
And the station manager
and the director and the anchors.

01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:03.853
And start developing my
own personal relationships.

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:06.173
I'd like to start meeting them this morning.
You'll take me around,

01:12:06.273 --> 01:12:08.992
you'll introduce me as the owner and
President of Video Production News

01:12:09.092 --> 01:12:12.262
and remind them of some
of my many other stories.

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:13.456
I'm not done.

01:12:13.556 --> 01:12:17.000
I also want to stop our discussion
over prices. This will save time.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.903
So when I say that a particular number is
my lowest price, that's my lowest price.

01:12:20.003 --> 01:12:23.373
And you can be assured that I arrived at
whatever that number is very carefully.

01:12:23.473 --> 01:12:27.444
Now, when I say that
I want these things,

01:12:28.044 --> 01:12:31.948
I mean that I want them.
And I don't want to have to ask again.

01:12:32.048 --> 01:12:35.152
And the last thing that I want, Nina, is for
you to do the things that I ask you to do

01:12:35.252 --> 01:12:38.686
when we're alone together in
your apartment. Not like the last time!

01:12:42.392 --> 01:12:43.160
So...

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:47.395
I'll tell you what.

01:12:48.465 --> 01:12:52.202
I have the van crash on Moorpark tonight.
It was a couple of stringers, actually.

01:12:52.302 --> 01:12:54.825
That could lead by itself
on an average night.

01:12:55.238 --> 01:12:57.095
I'd be willing to
throw that in for free.

01:12:59.976 --> 01:13:02.309
So what do you say, do we have a deal?

01:13:05.982 --> 01:13:08.151
Lisa Mays, Ben Waterman, Lou Bloom.

01:13:08.251 --> 01:13:09.986
- Hi.
- Hello. How are you, Lisa?

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:12.689
You remember Lou from
the Benedict Canyon crash.

01:13:12.789 --> 01:13:14.090
Oh, yeah. Amazing stuff.

01:13:14.190 --> 01:13:16.359
That was my company,
Video Production News.

01:13:16.459 --> 01:13:17.861
I would just like to say

01:13:17.961 --> 01:13:21.364
that I think that what the two
of you do is incredibly valuable.

01:13:21.464 --> 01:13:22.899
- Thank you.
- That's nice of you to say.

01:13:22.999 --> 01:13:24.507
We appreciate it.

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:27.070
I don't know how long this tape runs,
we might dump out.

01:13:27.170 --> 01:13:29.339
Twenty seconds to back.
Ben and Lisa, 20 seconds to back.

01:13:29.439 --> 01:13:31.674
Set up a sting dig,
Camera Two on a two-shot.

01:13:31.774 --> 01:13:33.777
- Where's the banner?
- Did we decide on one?

01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:36.346
Horror House. What did we talk about?

01:13:36.446 --> 01:13:39.382
Can you build that?
Put it on CG-one. Back in 10 seconds.

01:13:39.482 --> 01:13:42.786
Nine, eight, seven, six,

01:13:43.186 --> 01:13:46.022
five, four, three,

01:13:46.122 --> 01:13:48.758
two, one. Sting it.

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:52.862
Mics. Dissolve. Cue.

01:13:52.962 --> 01:13:55.265
<i>Hello, everybody.
This is KWLA with breaking news.</i>

01:13:55.365 --> 01:13:57.034
<i>Over the last half-hour or so,</i>

01:13:57.134 --> 01:14:00.804
<i>we've now received word of an apparent
home invasion triple homicide</i>

01:14:00.904 --> 01:14:03.206
<i>in the Granada Hills area
of the San Fernando Valley.</i>

01:14:03.306 --> 01:14:05.208
<i>Now, at present,
the number of those dead...</i>

01:14:05.308 --> 01:14:07.344
- Preset Camera Two.
- <i>...have not been confirmed yet by the police</i>

01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:12.349
<i>but KWLA has obtained exclusive
footage from inside the crime scene</i>

01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:14.718
<i>in which at least three
bodies can be observed.</i>

01:14:14.818 --> 01:14:17.320
<i>Now, we're going to show you
segments of that footage</i>

01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:20.457
<i>throughout the rest of this broadcast,
but also throughout the day.</i>

01:14:20.557 --> 01:14:23.660
Ben, Lisa, I have a tape. When you're ready,
throw to it. I'll follow you.

01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:27.564
<i>Again, we're about to show
you exclusive KWLA video</i>

01:14:27.664 --> 01:14:29.299
<i>from inside the actual crime scene.</i>

01:14:29.399 --> 01:14:32.535
- It's graphic. Repeat it.
- <i>And before broadcasting this video,</i>

01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:36.439
<i>we want to warn our viewers that
these are extremely graphic images.</i>

01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:39.275
<i>And I'm hearing from our control
room that we have that video,</i>

01:14:39.375 --> 01:14:40.944
<i>- and we're going to show it now.
- Let's roll it now.</i>

01:14:41.044 --> 01:14:44.414
<i>This is footage that we have
obtained exclusively by KWLA</i>

01:14:44.514 --> 01:14:48.084
<i>from Video Production News. This is a
professional news-gathering service.</i>

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:52.655
<i>And this is what appears to be a shotgun,
something you might use for home defense.</i>

01:14:52.755 --> 01:14:55.158
<i>You can see the pistol grips
on the front and the back there.</i>

01:14:55.258 --> 01:14:57.060
<i>Quite possibly the murder weapon.</i>

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.896
<i>And now, Lisa, as we move inside,
this is a beautiful home.</i>

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:02.299
<i>A beautiful home in a
very safe neighborhood.</i>

01:15:02.399 --> 01:15:04.434
<i>Or, what most people think
is a safe neighborhood.</i>

01:15:04.534 --> 01:15:07.570
<i>And it appears that
that is the first body.</i>

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.739
<i>A young woman,
I'm guessing, from this angle.</i>

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:11.541
<i>A young woman on a sofa, there.</i>

01:15:11.641 --> 01:15:14.344
<i>All of the faces, though,
have been blurred out.</i>

01:15:14.444 --> 01:15:17.647
- They've escaped. They're on the loose.
- <i>That is the first of what we understand</i>

01:15:17.747 --> 01:15:20.283
<i>are three bodies in the
home in Granada Hills.</i>

01:15:20.383 --> 01:15:25.188
<i>And this was committed by a suspect,
or suspects who are still out there.</i>

01:15:25.288 --> 01:15:27.907
<i>They're believed to have escaped.
And if you think about that,</i>

01:15:28.007 --> 01:15:30.193
- <i>that is a very frightening thought.</i>
- Repeat that.

01:15:30.293 --> 01:15:33.830
<i>Yes, scary, and very concerning,
particularly given what we're looking at here.</i>

01:15:33.930 --> 01:15:36.499
<i>The savagery of what
these pictures show.</i>

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:38.101
<i>And now, look, there on the floor.</i>

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:40.904
Lisa, what is that?
A bloodied article of clothing?

01:15:41.004 --> 01:15:42.505
<i>It looks like a silk shirt.</i>

01:15:42.605 --> 01:15:45.675
- <i>Maybe a woman's silk blouse.</i>
- <i>It's just so sad.</i>

01:15:45.775 --> 01:15:47.610
Stand by to dissolve, Two.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:50.113
<i>...obviously, there is the second body.</i>

01:15:50.213 --> 01:15:51.648
- They've escaped. Repeat it.
- <i>The person or people</i>

01:15:51.748 --> 01:15:54.317
<i>who committed all of this
brutal home invasion robbery,</i>

01:15:54.417 --> 01:15:57.687
<i>they're presently unidentified
and at large, still on the streets.</i>

01:15:57.787 --> 01:16:00.557
- Hit it again. Harder.
- <i>This has got to be a huge worry</i>

01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:03.626
<i>not only to the residents in this
neighborhood, Granada Hills area as well.</i>

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:05.144
<i>All of Los Angeles,
if you think about it.</i>

01:16:05.244 --> 01:16:07.864
<i>Yeah, the entire Southland, really.
Tonight, absolutely.</i>

01:16:07.964 --> 01:16:10.500
<i>An apparent family attacked,
savagely killed.</i>

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:14.571
<i>We believe this is their own home.
In what is one of the quieter,</i>

01:16:14.671 --> 01:16:17.840
<i>I think a frankly more upscale
and affluent neighborhoods</i>

01:16:17.940 --> 01:16:20.810
- <i>in the whole Valley.</i>
- <i>In all of Los Angeles.</i>

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:23.212
<i>And now, as we're moving,
this is a nursery.</i>

01:16:23.312 --> 01:16:24.414
<i>- And you hope to God...</i>
- Build it.

01:16:24.514 --> 01:16:26.849
<i>...that there's not a baby in that crib.</i>

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:29.218
<i>Yeah, you're just praying
that that crib is empty.</i>

01:16:29.318 --> 01:16:31.221
<i>Because this is definitely
a child's room.</i>

01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:34.223
<i>And, now, as we look, thank goodness.
Absolutely great.</i>

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:37.860
<i>In fact, our understanding right now is
that there was no baby found in the house.</i>

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:41.330
<i>Or any baby that was seen at all by
the people who filmed this for us.</i>

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.600
- <i>Thank goodness.</i>
- <i>That's Video News,</i>

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:46.603
<i>this is a professional
news-gathering service that we use.</i>

01:16:46.703 --> 01:16:48.771
<i>Apparently, what we're hearing
from their photographer</i>

01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:52.241
<i>is that they arrived even
before the police did.</i>

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:56.579
<i>And then entered this home to help,
or at least offer some sort of assistance</i>

01:16:56.679 --> 01:16:58.514
<i>and then came upon what
you're looking at here.</i>

01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:00.950
- <i>They came upon three bodies.</i>
- <i>Gruesome crime scenes that we're watching.</i>

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:03.853
<i>And that, right there is
the third body on the floor.</i>

01:17:03.953 --> 01:17:06.923
<i>This is a man, gray hair. What would
you think, Lisa? Maybe 40s, 50s?</i>

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:10.327
- <i>Yeah, 50s. Maybe even 60s.</i>
- "Vicious attack."

01:17:10.427 --> 01:17:12.262
<i>We've been looking at all
this graphic footage</i>

01:17:12.362 --> 01:17:14.464
<i>and just the viciousness,
the severity of violence.</i>

01:17:14.564 --> 01:17:16.199
Stand by master control,
we're going to come to a break.

01:17:16.299 --> 01:17:18.668
We're going to commercial, then cutting
to Joel and a police statement.

01:17:18.768 --> 01:17:23.072
<i>I'm getting word right now that police
are getting ready to issue a statement</i>

01:17:23.172 --> 01:17:26.009
<i>from the scene and
Joel Beatty is there for that.</i>

01:17:26.109 --> 01:17:27.777
<i>And I think right now,
we're going to take a quick break.</i>

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:31.414
Ready to break in five, four...
Sneak in your music.

01:17:31.514 --> 01:17:34.083
Three, two, one.

01:17:34.183 --> 01:17:36.953
Fade to black. Roll your break.
That's a 10-share.

01:17:38.488 --> 01:17:42.025
I want theme music on the return,
the cut we used for the Simi rail crash.

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:44.293
Audio, cut 32, please.
Cut 32 when we come back.

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:51.334
- Hello?
- Rolling with your banner.

01:17:51.434 --> 01:17:53.133
Thank you.

01:17:54.036 --> 01:17:55.938
Actually, he'd like to meet you.

01:17:56.038 --> 01:17:57.740
Come back, One, and key on Ben.

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.676
<i>Hey, heads up, you guys.
The police spokesman</i>

01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:02.276
<i>- is making an announcement in 60 seconds.</i>
- I gotta go.

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:06.783
<i>Nina, we are getting a ton of heat from
the police out here about that video.</i>

01:18:07.383 --> 01:18:09.786
- Tell them to call the station.
- Fifteen seconds.

01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:11.708
<i>They want to talk to
the person who shot it.</i>

01:18:11.808 --> 01:18:14.857
I shot it.
Joel, it's Video Production News.

01:18:14.957 --> 01:18:17.627
- Tell them to call me.
- Lou, they can't hear you.

01:18:17.727 --> 01:18:18.995
Coming back in five,

01:18:19.395 --> 01:18:23.332
four, three, two, one.

01:18:23.532 --> 01:18:24.767
Fade up.

01:18:29.906 --> 01:18:33.076
<i>We have more information coming in
from the Granada Hills area</i>

01:18:33.176 --> 01:18:35.144
<i>and the scene of an
apparent home invasion</i>

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:38.014
<i>that has left a husband and wife
and their housekeeper...</i>

01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:39.415
<i>What we know at the moment is that</i>

01:18:39.515 --> 01:18:43.153
<i>at some time around 5:00 this morning,</i>
<i>gunmen broke into this upscale...</i>

01:18:43.253 --> 01:18:46.422
<i>Residents are disturbed and concerned
by the brutal triple murder...</i>

01:18:46.522 --> 01:18:48.591
<i>The way we got it, though,
is a video production crew</i>

01:18:48.691 --> 01:18:50.093
<i>that we work with from time to time.</i>

01:18:50.193 --> 01:18:53.963
<i>They, apparently, arrived on the scene in
Granada Hills before the police got there.</i>

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:56.933
- <i>Before anybody.</i>
- <i>The photographer who took those pictures</i>

01:18:57.033 --> 01:18:59.502
<i>told us earlier that
he walked up to the door,</i>

01:18:59.602 --> 01:19:02.205
<i>he saw what we all saw in his videotape.</i>

01:19:02.305 --> 01:19:05.174
<i>And then he started to look inside,
so that he could help</i>

01:19:05.274 --> 01:19:07.009
<i>or render assistance to someone.</i>

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:10.079
<i>That's when he walked into the house
and started shooting the video.</i>

01:19:10.179 --> 01:19:12.381
<i>- He found the three deceased in the house.
- He found the three bodies.</i>

01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:14.339
<i>The two females and the one...</i>

01:19:26.328 --> 01:19:27.430
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:30.433
I'm Detective Frontieri.
This is my partner, Detective Lieberman.

01:19:30.533 --> 01:19:33.002
- Are you Louis Bloom?
- Yes, I'm Lou.

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:35.338
- You live here?
- Yes, that's right.

01:19:35.438 --> 01:19:36.606
May we come inside?

01:19:36.806 --> 01:19:37.974
- Why?
- Why not?

01:19:38.074 --> 01:19:40.009
- You want to?
- Yes.

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:42.643
- I don't care.
- Wonderful.

01:19:47.984 --> 01:19:51.220
- You were in Granada Hills last night.
- Yes, that's right.

01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:55.124
- You shot the video in the house?
- Yes, ma'am, I did. That's right.

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:58.708
You went inside the house?
You filmed all through the house?

01:19:59.595 --> 01:20:02.632
You even filmed the bodies.
All before the police came.

01:20:02.832 --> 01:20:05.134
- That door was open, ma'am.
- Detective.

01:20:05.234 --> 01:20:09.372
The door was open and what I did was
I went in to see if I could help,

01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:12.375
- because the alarm was ringing.
- An active crime scene.

01:20:12.475 --> 01:20:14.608
I didn't know it was a crime scene.

01:20:15.344 --> 01:20:16.613
You knew what it was.

01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:19.015
I know that an alarm means
someone is in trouble.

01:20:19.215 --> 01:20:21.518
And you sold it to be shown on TV.

01:20:21.618 --> 01:20:23.553
We're a professional
news-gathering service.

01:20:23.953 --> 01:20:25.922
What did you see when you arrived?

01:20:26.022 --> 01:20:29.926
- Two men leaving in a vehicle.
- You saw two men?

01:20:30.026 --> 01:20:32.929
They were just shapes, really.
I was afraid, so I hid.

01:20:33.029 --> 01:20:36.632
And then I saw the shapes of two men
moving inside the vehicle, if that helps.

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:40.703
- Describe the men.
- It was dark. And then they drove away.

01:20:40.803 --> 01:20:42.872
- Black? White? Tall?
- I couldn't see.

01:20:42.972 --> 01:20:45.472
- What were they driving?
- An SUV.

01:20:46.108 --> 01:20:49.378
- Dark-colored.
- Rims? Tinted windows?

01:20:49.478 --> 01:20:51.748
Maybe. Not that I saw.

01:20:51.948 --> 01:20:53.950
Do you have any film
on the men or the car?

01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:56.619
No, I don't. I only started
filming when I was inside.

01:20:58.487 --> 01:21:00.056
I'd like a copy of that footage.

01:21:00.656 --> 01:21:02.625
Do I have to give it to you?

01:21:02.925 --> 01:21:05.161
Is there any reason why you wouldn't?

01:21:05.261 --> 01:21:08.297
No, no, I made you a copy.
I expected someone to come.

01:22:17.433 --> 01:22:19.299
What's up, man?

01:22:20.136 --> 01:22:22.672
I'm tired. Aren't you tired?

01:22:22.972 --> 01:22:24.522
Why are we starting so early?

01:22:25.474 --> 01:22:28.809
One of the people in the
house last night was alive.

01:22:30.179 --> 01:22:32.148
I cut that part out.

01:22:32.348 --> 01:22:34.317
I also cut out the men
leaving in their car.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.605
I have a name and an address.
We're gonna drive there.

01:22:36.705 --> 01:22:38.954
We're gonna find the person
that drove that car.

01:22:40.174 --> 01:22:42.659
So you know who killed those people?

01:22:43.259 --> 01:22:45.025
One of them, quite possibly, yes.

01:22:46.262 --> 01:22:47.964
You gotta call the cops.

01:22:48.264 --> 01:22:49.796
And we will, at the right time.

01:22:58.641 --> 01:23:02.042
I'm offering you a real
opportunity here, Rick.

01:23:02.611 --> 01:23:04.123
To do what?

01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:10.620
I don't usually share my business
plan with you.

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:14.657
But a moment has arrived
that could allow the company

01:23:14.757 --> 01:23:17.624
to make enough money
to expand to the next level.

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:21.238
We could call this...

01:23:23.799 --> 01:23:26.222
the critical moment.

01:23:26.936 --> 01:23:31.341
I'm inviting you, Rick, to be a part of
the team that pounces on this opportunity.

01:23:31.741 --> 01:23:33.574
You've been asking a lot about
your performance review.

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:36.716
- Yeah.
- Well.

01:23:37.313 --> 01:23:39.148
For starters,

01:23:39.648 --> 01:23:42.916
I've been seeing a great improvement in
your overall focus and order-following.

01:23:44.153 --> 01:23:47.433
Given complex problems, you're developing
a real ability to find clear

01:23:47.533 --> 01:23:51.027
and simple solutions. I'm also
aware of your increased enthusiasm.

01:23:51.127 --> 01:23:53.495
It's great to see your eyes light up
when you're working on a new idea.

01:23:53.595 --> 01:23:58.365
I hope you'll be inspiring us with your
innovative thinking for years to come.

01:23:59.802 --> 01:24:02.803
Thank you, man. I'm trying. You know?

01:24:04.073 --> 01:24:06.208
Which is why I'm promoting you

01:24:06.308 --> 01:24:09.080
to Executive Vice President

01:24:09.351 --> 01:24:11.470
of Video News.

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:15.315
What am I now?

01:24:15.951 --> 01:24:17.885
You're an assistant.

01:24:20.122 --> 01:24:22.879
That's... Big.

01:24:26.895 --> 01:24:30.499
- Does it come with a raise?
- Absolutely.

01:24:31.477 --> 01:24:33.099
How much?

01:24:34.303 --> 01:24:37.070
Pick a number. You pick a number.

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.131
A...

01:24:45.481 --> 01:24:49.716
$75 a night?

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:52.232
Agreed.

01:24:54.523 --> 01:24:56.892
What about... What about more? You know?

01:24:56.992 --> 01:25:00.482
Not now. We closed the deal.

01:25:03.399 --> 01:25:06.967
- I could have gotten more, couldn't I?
- Absolutely.

01:25:09.371 --> 01:25:11.707
All right. It's coming up on the left.

01:25:12.007 --> 01:25:15.742
Halfway down the block.
1701 North Burns.

01:25:26.355 --> 01:25:28.424
- Is that the car?
- That's the car.

01:25:28.524 --> 01:25:29.589
Oh, shit.

01:25:51.614 --> 01:25:54.683
- Do you think there's a reward?
- There is a reward.

01:25:54.783 --> 01:25:57.178
- How much?
- $50,000.

01:25:58.354 --> 01:26:01.180
- Do I get any of that?
- I just gave you a raise.

01:26:02.525 --> 01:26:05.461
That's salary. I mean,
like a bonus, you know?

01:26:05.561 --> 01:26:08.264
Bonuses come at the end of the year.

01:26:16.639 --> 01:26:17.706
So, we're gonna call it in?

01:26:17.806 --> 01:26:19.675
- We're gonna wait.
- For what?

01:26:19.775 --> 01:26:21.377
First, we want to see
if he's actually inside.

01:26:21.477 --> 01:26:24.811
And then, we want to find a more
interesting place to film the arrest.

01:26:25.614 --> 01:26:27.057
Like where?

01:26:29.418 --> 01:26:31.153
Anywhere we want.

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:34.257
What we're going to do, is we're gonna
wait and then we're gonna follow him.

01:26:35.057 --> 01:26:37.793
When he reaches what would be considered
a better or more populated neighborhood,

01:26:37.893 --> 01:26:41.397
then we'll report his location to the police.
He's a violent, wanted criminal.

01:26:41.497 --> 01:26:44.831
I can't believe that he's just
going to peacefully surrender.

01:26:51.407 --> 01:26:53.473
Okay. I want more money.

01:26:54.076 --> 01:26:55.242
A lot more.

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:08.357
What makes a job desirable, Rick,
isn't just the dollar amount attached to it.

01:27:08.457 --> 01:27:12.060
You're at the ground floor of a
growing business. Your reward is a career.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.564
Fuck that. You're talking about
some seriously messed-up shit.

01:27:15.664 --> 01:27:19.735
You're just expecting me to just
go along with it. I want more.

01:27:19.935 --> 01:27:22.738
I can't make people do things, Rick.
You have a choice if you wanna do this.

01:27:22.838 --> 01:27:24.601
And I have a choice if you don't.

01:27:26.642 --> 01:27:28.175
Are you threatening to fire me?

01:27:29.144 --> 01:27:32.281
Hey, I... I got something, too.
How about not calling in criminals,

01:27:32.381 --> 01:27:35.985
waiting for them to start some shit so you
can film it? That's against the fucking law.

01:27:36.485 --> 01:27:39.788
Yeah, cops would be majorly
interested in that, no doubt.

01:27:39.888 --> 01:27:42.656
Okay? So, I... I want more money.

01:27:45.894 --> 01:27:47.861
We can re-open negotiations, Rick.

01:27:48.697 --> 01:27:53.669
But, remember, when it comes to your
work reputation, you can't un-ring the bell.

01:27:54.069 --> 01:27:56.370
I want half of whatever we make tonight.

01:27:57.706 --> 01:27:59.372
How did you arrive at that number?

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:04.246
There's two of us out here. So, 50-50.

01:28:04.346 --> 01:28:06.315
I'll counter at $10,000.

01:28:06.415 --> 01:28:10.650
You don't set the numbers on this.
I want half. I want half.

01:28:11.687 --> 01:28:14.788
If you're saying I can't negotiate,
then I guess I'm...

01:28:22.264 --> 01:28:24.731
I'm just gonna have to give it to you.

01:28:27.703 --> 01:28:29.705
Well, all right, then.

01:28:30.906 --> 01:28:35.608
Now I can feel good about it, at least.
Now, I'll go the extra mile.

01:28:36.245 --> 01:28:39.446
That's what you never understood, man.
It's been the problem the whole time.

01:28:42.017 --> 01:28:43.819
You gotta bring people in, Lou.
Seriously.

01:28:43.919 --> 01:28:46.789
You gotta talk to them like
they're fucking human beings.

01:28:46.889 --> 01:28:50.693
I'm saying this for you, dude.
For the future, to help you.

01:28:50.793 --> 01:28:53.470
Because you got a seriously
weird-ass way of looking at shit.

01:28:54.596 --> 01:28:56.458
You know you do!

01:28:57.099 --> 01:29:00.355
You know what your trouble is, man?
You don't fucking understand people.

01:29:02.771 --> 01:29:03.770
Okay?

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:08.642
I'll take the first watch.

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:11.378
Okay.

01:29:35.571 --> 01:29:37.243
Rise and shine.

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:39.641
He's leaving.

01:29:42.778 --> 01:29:45.578
- Is that him?
- That's one of them.

01:30:28.190 --> 01:30:30.225
You're too fucking close, man.

01:30:30.525 --> 01:30:32.059
Oh, shit.

01:30:33.395 --> 01:30:34.496
You're too fucking close.

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:38.565
This guy might have already seen us,
and he's bringing us here as a trap.

01:30:40.068 --> 01:30:41.801
You ever think of that?

01:30:46.241 --> 01:30:47.474
Oh, shit.

01:31:26.748 --> 01:31:30.049
They're gonna see us.
We're in a red fucking car.

01:31:32.220 --> 01:31:34.588
Lower your window, please.

01:32:04.052 --> 01:32:07.187
- Keep your window down.
- I'm fucking cold.

01:32:17.099 --> 01:32:18.665
Shit, they're parking.

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:21.034
Keep going.

01:32:39.154 --> 01:32:40.555
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

01:32:40.655 --> 01:32:43.258
Yes, good evening. Hello?
I'd like to report the location of two men

01:32:43.358 --> 01:32:46.528
responsible for the triple murder
in Granada Hills last night.

01:32:46.828 --> 01:32:48.565
- <i>What's your address?</i>
- I followed them,

01:32:48.665 --> 01:32:51.733
and they just pulled into the Chinatown
Express at Western and Third.

01:32:51.833 --> 01:32:53.569
I can see them inside.

01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:57.072
<i>Okay, it's a restaurant called
Chinatown Express at Western and Third.</i>

01:32:57.172 --> 01:32:59.541
That's right. I can see them at
the counter and they're ordering.

01:32:59.641 --> 01:33:01.910
These men are wanted for the triple
murder in Granada Hills last night.

01:33:02.010 --> 01:33:04.079
<i>- What's your name, sir?</i>
- Louis Bloom.

01:33:04.179 --> 01:33:05.814
<i>Do you have a description of the men?</i>

01:33:05.914 --> 01:33:07.649
Yes, I do.
They're both Latin American men.

01:33:07.749 --> 01:33:10.419
Probably what you would call Hispanic.

01:33:10.519 --> 01:33:13.355
One is big, very much on the heavy side.

01:33:13.455 --> 01:33:16.424
And the other's face is scratched.
He has scratches on his face.

01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:17.594
<i>How old are the men?</i>

01:33:18.627 --> 01:33:22.431
Thirty. Perhaps, maybe, 35.

01:33:22.631 --> 01:33:24.366
<i>What are they wearing?</i>

01:33:24.466 --> 01:33:26.602
The big man is wearing light
pants and a striped sweater,

01:33:26.702 --> 01:33:29.304
and the man with scratches is
wearing brown pants and a vest.

01:33:29.404 --> 01:33:32.371
He looks like he has a... gun.

01:33:32.874 --> 01:33:34.343
<i>You said the suspect is armed?</i>

01:33:34.443 --> 01:33:38.111
I believe so, yes. I'm sorry, I have to go.
Otherwise, they might see me.

01:33:50.325 --> 01:33:53.127
<i>All west units, possible 187.
Suspects there now.</i>

01:33:53.227 --> 01:33:56.231
<i>Western and Third.
Western and Third at Chinatown Express.</i>

01:33:56.331 --> 01:33:59.151
<i>Suspects are two male Hispanics.
Number one, large build.</i>

01:33:59.251 --> 01:34:02.788
<i>Number two with scratches on his face,
inside the location. Possibly armed.</i>

01:34:02.888 --> 01:34:06.308
<i>Code Three, incident 357 and 9753.</i>

01:34:06.708 --> 01:34:08.877
There's fucking people in there.

01:34:08.977 --> 01:34:12.314
- I count six.
- Oh, shit!

01:34:12.414 --> 01:34:14.751
So, they could start shooting.

01:34:15.417 --> 01:34:16.302
They could.

01:34:16.402 --> 01:34:19.387
So you said we were waiting for a
better neighborhood with more people,

01:34:19.487 --> 01:34:21.740
- not a fucking restaurant.
- We work with what we're given.

01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.792
<i>Unit 14, responding to that Code Three.</i>

01:34:23.892 --> 01:34:27.126
You're going to go down the street,
get an angle inside from over there.

01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:32.868
Steady hands. Use the zoom.
No fast pans. I'll be filming from here.

01:34:32.968 --> 01:34:35.568
Fuck that. I'm not
getting out of the car!

01:34:37.806 --> 01:34:41.409
I need a second angle from down
the street. We'll cut it together.

01:34:41.509 --> 01:34:45.447
Two angles. Believe me,
it's more dangerous here in the car.

01:34:45.547 --> 01:34:49.351
I don't believe anything you say.
Man, this is fucked!

01:34:49.951 --> 01:34:52.554
Do you know I've never once
sworn in front of an employer?

01:34:52.654 --> 01:34:55.457
I am not doing it!
I'm not getting out of the car.

01:34:55.757 --> 01:34:57.392
You're making a mistake.

01:34:57.492 --> 01:35:00.860
I don't care about
the fucking job title.

01:35:05.967 --> 01:35:10.203
What if my problem wasn't that I don't
understand people, but that I don't like them?

01:35:13.008 --> 01:35:16.476
What if I was obliged to hurt you
for something like this?

01:35:17.946 --> 01:35:19.512
I mean, physically.

01:35:21.183 --> 01:35:26.021
I think you'd have to believe afterwards,
if you could, that agreeing to participate

01:35:26.121 --> 01:35:29.458
and then backing out at the
critical moment was a mistake.

01:35:29.958 --> 01:35:31.665
Because that's what I'm telling you.

01:35:34.996 --> 01:35:38.667
As clearly...

01:35:39.345 --> 01:35:41.049
as I can.

01:37:00.115 --> 01:37:03.182
<i>7-A-14. We're Code Six to location.</i>

01:37:06.655 --> 01:37:09.856
<i>7-A-21. Show us backing 7-A-14.</i>

01:38:06.714 --> 01:38:08.429
Oh, God.

01:38:17.525 --> 01:38:20.092
<i>7-A-21. We're Code Six with 7-A-14.</i>

01:38:39.147 --> 01:38:40.880
Oh, God.

01:38:42.383 --> 01:38:44.017
Oh, God.

01:38:51.993 --> 01:38:53.059
Gun!

01:38:54.529 --> 01:38:56.498
Oh, God! Oh, fuck!

01:38:57.198 --> 01:38:59.297
We have a gun! Two of them!

01:39:01.021 --> 01:39:01.970
Call it in!

01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:05.006
<i>Shots fired. Shots fired.
Officer down. Officer needs help.</i>

01:39:06.241 --> 01:39:08.407
One's down! In pursuit!

01:39:09.344 --> 01:39:10.645
Go, go, go!

01:39:20.822 --> 01:39:24.326
<i>Suspect leaving in a black Escalade
and out of the location, heading north.</i>

01:39:24.626 --> 01:39:27.229
- Fuck!
- Did you get it?

01:39:27.329 --> 01:39:29.131
There's people dead in there!

01:39:29.931 --> 01:39:32.565
<i>7-A-27. I'm behind vehicle,
we are in pursuit.</i>

01:39:34.235 --> 01:39:36.304
<i>7-A-27, roger.</i>

01:39:36.404 --> 01:39:39.641
- <i>All units at all frequencies, stand by.</i>
- Aim the camera at the car and start filming.

01:39:39.741 --> 01:39:42.911
<i>7-A-27 in pursuit,
northbound through the alley of 187.</i>

01:39:43.011 --> 01:39:44.777
<i>Suspect vehicle is a black Escalade.</i>

01:39:47.115 --> 01:39:49.248
Rick, start filming!

01:39:57.025 --> 01:39:59.227
<i>7-A-27. We just turned
northbound on Western.</i>

01:39:59.327 --> 01:40:01.897
- Stay on the police car.
- You're right up his ass.

01:40:02.597 --> 01:40:04.232
Wide angle. We want all of this.

01:40:04.332 --> 01:40:06.234
<i>Requesting backup and an air unit.</i>

01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:08.470
<i>Any air unit, come in
on Wilshire frequency.</i>

01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:09.904
- Lou, Lou, Lou!
- I got it.

01:40:14.742 --> 01:40:17.245
<i>Northbound. 70 miles an hour.
Approaching a fresh red.</i>

01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:18.480
Steady hands, Rick.

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.383
It's a red light! It's a red light!
Red light!

01:40:21.483 --> 01:40:22.748
<i>...approaching a red light.</i>

01:40:23.284 --> 01:40:24.350
Oh, shit!

01:40:25.954 --> 01:40:27.155
<i>Six, North, Charles, Queen,</i>

01:40:27.255 --> 01:40:29.224
<i>5-3-2. Black Escalade.</i>

01:40:29.324 --> 01:40:31.059
- <i>Give me an ETA on an air ship.</i>
- Fuck!

01:40:31.759 --> 01:40:34.560
<i>Air A team responding with a
light for mission. Stand by.</i>

01:40:38.400 --> 01:40:40.468
<i>Heading northbound Western,
south of suspect.</i>

01:40:40.568 --> 01:40:42.602
<i>Approaching another fresh red.
Suspect is turning...</i>

01:40:43.271 --> 01:40:44.410
Oh, shit!

01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:47.042
<i>7-A-27, come in.</i>

01:40:47.142 --> 01:40:50.545
Oh, my... Did you see that?
Did you see that?

01:40:50.645 --> 01:40:52.378
<i>No acknowledgment from 7-A-27.</i>

01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:57.585
Lou, look out, look out!

01:40:57.685 --> 01:40:59.854
<i>7-L-0-7. I'm now primary.</i>

01:40:59.954 --> 01:41:02.024
<i>Suspect is behind me.</i>

01:41:02.524 --> 01:41:06.759
- <i>7-L-7 is now primary.</i>
- Lou, Lou, please. We're way too close.

01:41:08.763 --> 01:41:11.967
- This guy's crazy. Fucking shit!
- <i>He's ramming my vehicle!</i>

01:41:12.067 --> 01:41:15.036
<i>All units. Officer needs help.
Northbound Western.</i>

01:41:15.136 --> 01:41:16.771
<i>Suspect now ramming a police vehicle.</i>

01:41:16.871 --> 01:41:19.707
- No matter what, keep shooting.
- <i>Continuing northbound.</i>

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:20.873
Fuck!

01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:23.209
Oh, shit! Shit!

01:41:24.545 --> 01:41:25.878
Oh, my God!

01:41:35.723 --> 01:41:37.556
<i>7-L-7, come in.</i>

01:41:40.395 --> 01:41:43.229
- <i>7-L-7, come in.</i>
- Turn off the car.

01:42:07.522 --> 01:42:10.656
He's dead. Get this shot.

01:42:25.206 --> 01:42:26.639
Steady hands.

01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:33.709
Use your zoom.

01:43:07.782 --> 01:43:09.784
Hold it right there! Put the gun down!

01:43:25.433 --> 01:43:27.068
He had a weapon. That was a just fire.

01:43:27.168 --> 01:43:28.406
He's not moving.

01:43:33.841 --> 01:43:35.342
Let's seal this off.

01:43:39.314 --> 01:43:40.980
You saw him.

01:43:44.852 --> 01:43:46.685
You saw him!

01:43:48.756 --> 01:43:53.394
I can't jeopardize my company's success

01:43:53.494 --> 01:43:57.963
to retain an untrustworthy employee.

01:43:59.567 --> 01:44:00.933
You're crazy.

01:44:03.338 --> 01:44:05.104
You're crazy!

01:44:06.274 --> 01:44:10.678
You took my bargaining power, Rick.
You used it against me.

01:44:10.778 --> 01:44:13.546
You would have done it again.
Just admit it.

01:44:15.950 --> 01:44:17.483
I don't know.

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.886
I don't know.

01:44:21.489 --> 01:44:23.022
I know.

01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:27.459
I know.

01:44:34.869 --> 01:44:38.370
Don't touch that unless it's for prints.
Make a clean sweep.

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:42.984
Go around the vehicle.

01:44:47.181 --> 01:44:49.348
Let them through, here they come.

01:45:08.569 --> 01:45:10.374
Hello, Juliana.

01:45:11.606 --> 01:45:13.105
Hello, Willy.

01:45:18.980 --> 01:45:20.648
- Hello, Ben. Hello, Lisa.
- Hi!

01:45:20.748 --> 01:45:23.017
- Hey. It's Lou, right?
- Yes, that's right!

01:45:23.117 --> 01:45:24.419
- Video News?
- That's right.

01:45:24.519 --> 01:45:26.343
- You got something good for us tonight?
- I think so.

01:45:26.443 --> 01:45:30.658
I'm about to show Nina right now.
I can tell by your tie, it's Friday.

01:46:08.763 --> 01:46:10.529
You can leave.

01:46:20.408 --> 01:46:22.602
Wasn't that your partner?

01:46:23.911 --> 01:46:26.260
As a matter of fact, that's him.

01:46:28.249 --> 01:46:30.382
Oh, I'm floored.

01:46:31.018 --> 01:46:33.740
I mean, it's amazing.

01:46:34.188 --> 01:46:35.861
Thank you.

01:46:36.457 --> 01:46:40.058
I mean, just amazing.

01:46:41.562 --> 01:46:43.197
Thank you.

01:46:43.297 --> 01:46:45.304
No, thank you.

01:46:46.434 --> 01:46:48.856
Thank you for bringing it to me.

01:46:49.704 --> 01:46:51.503
You're welcome.

01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:56.909
- I want it, obviously.
- How much do you want it?

01:46:58.646 --> 01:47:00.479
You tell me.

01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:04.585
Get this to graphics.

01:47:04.685 --> 01:47:06.788
- Who's in charge here?
- Who are you?

01:47:06.888 --> 01:47:10.024
LAPD. Major case.
Pull the footage from these screens.

01:47:10.124 --> 01:47:12.527
- Round it up. Let's go. All copies.
- Excuse me.

01:47:13.227 --> 01:47:15.496
I'm the news director. Can I help you?

01:47:15.596 --> 01:47:17.932
You can help yourself by collecting up
every copy of the shootout

01:47:18.032 --> 01:47:21.569
- the chase, the crash, all of it. Now.
- It's KWLA property.

01:47:21.669 --> 01:47:23.404
- It's evidence.
- Of what?

01:47:23.504 --> 01:47:27.508
I got a cop near death in the hospital,
three dead, four wounded,

01:47:27.608 --> 01:47:31.045
and a dozen major crimes stretching
a mile of Third. This tape is evidence.

01:47:31.245 --> 01:47:34.315
It's news footage bought and paid for
from an independent contractor.

01:47:34.415 --> 01:47:35.583
And how do you think he got it?

01:47:35.683 --> 01:47:38.319
- If there's an issue, speak to him.
- Don't get in the way of this.

01:47:38.419 --> 01:47:41.055
Unless you have a judge's order,
we're going with it in four minutes.

01:47:41.355 --> 01:47:44.159
Hey. Isn't that him?

01:47:48.996 --> 01:47:51.002
Camera One, stay centered up.

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.933
Camera Two, we'll do a
zoom out when we come out.

01:47:56.237 --> 01:47:57.822
Joel has got a source on the taskforce

01:47:57.922 --> 01:48:00.542
who says they found drugs
at the Granada Hills house.

01:48:00.642 --> 01:48:04.245
Cocaine in wrapped packages hidden
in crawlspaces. Over 50 pounds.

01:48:04.345 --> 01:48:07.148
And he confirmed it with an
investigator at the scene.

01:48:07.248 --> 01:48:09.951
It wasn't a home invasion.
It was a drug robbery.

01:48:10.051 --> 01:48:11.861
Give it to the noon crew.

01:48:12.887 --> 01:48:15.190
- This is news.
- It detracts from the story.

01:48:15.290 --> 01:48:17.158
It is the story.

01:48:17.258 --> 01:48:21.530
The story is urban crime creeping
into the suburbs. That's the story.

01:48:22.630 --> 01:48:25.366
- Jesus, you sound like Lou.
- Ten seconds to back.

01:48:25.466 --> 01:48:29.137
I think Lou is inspiring all
of us to reach a little higher.

01:48:29.237 --> 01:48:32.087
Five, four, three,

01:48:32.187 --> 01:48:34.548
two, one. Sting it.

01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:38.477
Mics. Dissolve.

01:48:49.490 --> 01:48:53.427
You understand that you've been read
your rights, and you're here voluntarily?

01:48:53.527 --> 01:48:55.471
That's right. Yes.

01:48:56.163 --> 01:48:58.300
And this is being recorded and filmed?

01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:01.166
<i>Yes, from the camera up there.</i>

01:49:01.569 --> 01:49:03.770
<i>Wide angle.</i>

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:11.312
Would you tell me how it is you were
at the Chinatown Express tonight

01:49:11.412 --> 01:49:12.880
and called the 911?

01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:16.114
Of course. It began earlier in the day.

01:49:17.184 --> 01:49:19.189
I was watering my plant.

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:22.757
I looked out my window at my apartment.

01:49:22.857 --> 01:49:25.827
The one you visited. And...

01:49:25.927 --> 01:49:29.130
I saw a dark-colored vehicle with two
men inside parked across the street.

01:49:29.230 --> 01:49:31.537
I didn't think anything of it,
otherwise I would have reported it then.

01:49:33.234 --> 01:49:36.292
We began our night, my...

01:49:38.372 --> 01:49:40.908
employee and myself.

01:49:41.008 --> 01:49:44.011
And around approximately 12:38,

01:49:44.111 --> 01:49:48.215
I looked in my rearview mirror and I
saw what looked like the same men

01:49:48.315 --> 01:49:51.686
in the same vehicle following us.
I made an evasive maneuver.

01:49:51.786 --> 01:49:54.689
I circled back and tailed
them to the restaurant.

01:49:54.789 --> 01:49:56.869
At which point, I saw them
go inside and recognized them

01:49:56.969 --> 01:49:59.474
as the same men from the home invasion.

01:50:00.327 --> 01:50:03.798
You told me you didn't see the men.
That you didn't get a good look at them.

01:50:04.098 --> 01:50:07.168
Well, it all came back to me
when I saw them going in.

01:50:07.268 --> 01:50:10.438
Their shapes and their movements.

01:50:10.538 --> 01:50:12.974
And then I saw that one of the men
had a gun under his shirt,

01:50:13.074 --> 01:50:16.243
so I immediately got my
phone and dialed 911.

01:50:16.343 --> 01:50:17.478
That's your story?

01:50:17.578 --> 01:50:19.947
That's what happened.
That's why I'm sitting here with you.

01:50:20.047 --> 01:50:23.384
I think that the men
saw my footage and...

01:50:23.484 --> 01:50:25.687
they tracked me down.

01:50:25.987 --> 01:50:28.120
You want to know what I think?

01:50:29.123 --> 01:50:31.125
Yes, please.

01:50:31.325 --> 01:50:34.079
I think you withheld information.

01:50:34.562 --> 01:50:37.598
I think you saw the two men in
the murder house in Granada Hills

01:50:37.698 --> 01:50:41.536
and you saw the car and you sat on it

01:50:41.836 --> 01:50:44.005
to get something you could film.

01:50:44.405 --> 01:50:46.471
What do you think about that?

01:50:48.008 --> 01:50:50.011
I think that would be...

01:50:50.111 --> 01:50:52.813
a very unprofessional thing
for me to do in my business.

01:50:52.913 --> 01:50:54.982
It would be murder.

01:50:55.282 --> 01:50:58.019
I can understand why you're looking into it,
but I didn't do anything like that.

01:50:58.119 --> 01:51:01.899
- Nothing that could be considered wrong.
- You don't fool me for a minute.

01:51:01.999 --> 01:51:06.327
- I'm glad.
- I think everything you said is a lie.

01:51:06.727 --> 01:51:08.779
I wish my partner was here
to back up what happened.

01:51:08.879 --> 01:51:10.498
You left your dead partner.

01:51:10.598 --> 01:51:13.334
No, the ambulances arrived.
They're trained professionals.

01:51:13.434 --> 01:51:15.832
Yeah, and you seem real
broken up about that.

01:51:16.170 --> 01:51:17.505
No...

01:51:17.705 --> 01:51:20.038
He died doing what he loved.

01:51:21.075 --> 01:51:23.912
You filmed him dying.

01:51:25.513 --> 01:51:27.682
<i>Yeah. That's what I do. It's my job.</i>

01:51:27.782 --> 01:51:31.383
<i>I like to say that if you're seeing me,
you're having the worst day of your life.</i>

01:52:04.151 --> 01:52:07.455
<i>Any Rampart unit, ambulance to
11 Rampart on Second Avenue.</i>

01:52:07.555 --> 01:52:10.255
<i>Victim, female, white.
Unknown property taken.</i>

01:52:29.109 --> 01:52:30.742
<i>Congratulations.</i>

01:52:32.947 --> 01:52:35.051
Congratulations.

01:52:35.883 --> 01:52:39.486

that I wouldn't do myself.
