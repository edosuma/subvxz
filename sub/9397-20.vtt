<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill.

00:02.480 --> 00:05.153
I have a heart condition
and if I play, I could die.

00:05.240 --> 00:07.470
You're lucky all I did was send him away.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.516
Daddy, that was Pete from Fall Out Boy.

00:09.600 --> 00:12.194
Marry me again in front of
all our friends and our family.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.918
When are you gonna get over
Jabba the Slut

00:14.000 --> 00:15.274
so we can go back to being friends?

00:15.360 --> 00:16.588
What are you doing to Rachel, Brooke?

00:16.680 --> 00:18.989
The picture,
Rachel said it was someone she knew.

00:19.080 --> 00:21.036
It's you. She used to be you.

00:21.120 --> 00:22.394
Just please be careful.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.754
What if we don't have sex
until we get married again?

00:25.840 --> 00:26.909
What, are you kidding?

00:27.120 --> 00:29.475
Uncle Cooper,
what are you doing here, man?

00:29.560 --> 00:30.709
I met this smoking-hot girl.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.439
She's 26, she's a model.
You know, my type.

00:34.760 --> 00:35.875
Mouth?

00:35.960 --> 00:37.075
I just thought maybe...

00:37.160 --> 00:38.388
You got flowers. Who are they from?

00:38.480 --> 00:39.799
Just promise me one thing.

00:39.880 --> 00:42.030
When you pick the boy
you're really gonna be with,

00:42.120 --> 00:44.111
that he'll be someone who respects you.

<i>Stepping up,</i>

01:32.160 --> 01:33.991
<i>it's a simple concept.</i>

01:34.280 --> 01:37.113
<i>It basically means to rise above yourself,</i>

01:37.560 --> 01:39.312
<i>to do a little more,</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:41.909
<i>to show you're something special.</i>

<i>Lucas is gone,</i>

01:52.640 --> 01:55.837

02:00.360 --> 02:03.909
<i>Another ferocious dunk by Nathan Scott,</i>
<i>and this crowd is on their feet!</i>

02:04.680 --> 02:07.069
You sure you don't want to sleep with me
until the ceremony?

02:07.160 --> 02:09.674
I know I look pretty sexy right now.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.718
<i>Life's funny sometimes.</i>
<i>It can push pretty hard.</i>

02:16.800 --> 02:20.190
<i>Like when you fall in love with someone</i>
<i>but they forget to love you back.</i>

02:20.280 --> 02:23.875
<i>Like when your best friend</i>
<i>and your boyfriend leave you alone.</i>

02:23.960 --> 02:28.636
<i>Like when you pull the trigger or</i>
<i>light the flame and you can't take it back.</i>

02:32.240 --> 02:35.437
<i>Like I said,</i>
<i>in sports they call this stepping up.</i>

02:35.800 --> 02:38.951
<i>In life, I call it pushing back.</i>

02:44.560 --> 02:45.629
Hey.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.149
Hey.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.073
Jenny didn't wake you up, did she?

02:51.160 --> 02:53.833
No. I mean, not... Not really.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.472
So what happened to you last night?

02:56.560 --> 02:58.790
Jenny was a little fussy,
so we slept on the couch.

02:58.880 --> 02:59.949
Oh.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.114
I didn't get a chance to thank you
before I crashed

03:03.200 --> 03:06.510
for getting in touch with me
after the whole shooting thing.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.828
It's a pretty good deal, right?

03:07.920 --> 03:10.480
You know, take a bullet,
get a call from Jake.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.028
I really wish
I could've been there for you, Peyton.

03:13.120 --> 03:14.314
I know.

03:15.120 --> 03:18.795
So listen, this is all, kind of last minute,
but I actually sort of had plans today.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.871
Oh, yeah, of course, you did. I'm sorry, I...

03:20.960 --> 03:22.279
No, it's just that Jenny and I,

03:22.360 --> 03:25.397
we usually spend Saturday mornings
in the park.

03:26.320 --> 03:28.959
So I thought maybe you'd like to come.

03:29.360 --> 03:31.112
That sounds perfect.

03:36.560 --> 03:37.879
Excuse me.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.230
- You're Haley, right?
- Yeah.

03:41.160 --> 03:44.152
- You look good in blue. It suits you.
- Thanks.

03:44.240 --> 03:46.708
You know what else
would look good on you?

03:46.800 --> 03:48.552
- Me.
- Oh.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.596
- I'm Damien West.
- I think you're out of your league.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.595
Nathan Scott.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.830
- What, you two know each other?
- From High Flyers.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.388
- You still missing your free throws, West?
- Who cares?

03:59.480 --> 04:01.630
They don't show free throws
on <i>SportsCenter.</i>

04:01.720 --> 04:04.598
You know what else they don't show?
Ravens.

04:05.920 --> 04:09.708
Hey, I heard you guys lost your shooter.
So I guess your season's over, huh?

04:09.800 --> 04:10.994
No, I don't think so.

04:11.080 --> 04:14.470
Well, unless you win this tournament
you're not making post-season.

04:14.560 --> 04:17.471
And you're not gonna win
this tournament, because we are.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.676
- And we're undefeated.
- For now.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.478
Let's go, Hales.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.036
See you on the court, Scott.

04:28.120 --> 04:30.918
And, Haley, I'll see you in your dreams.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.113
Peyton Sawyer.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.157
It's so crazy that you're here.

04:35.240 --> 04:37.754
I think when my dad told me
to follow my heart, he didn't anticipate

04:37.840 --> 04:41.196
me following it all the way down
to Savannah for the weekend.

04:41.280 --> 04:43.111
How's your life, Jake?

04:43.960 --> 04:47.555
Well, twice a week it's awesome.
Those are the days I get Jenny.

04:47.640 --> 04:48.755
What?

04:48.840 --> 04:50.831
Yeah, it's a long story.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.596
Basically... Hey, let's go.

04:53.880 --> 04:55.598
Come on, let's go.

04:55.680 --> 04:58.274
Basically, when Nicki left Tree Hill,

04:58.840 --> 05:01.832
she took Jenny here to Savannah
to be with her parents.

05:01.920 --> 05:04.718
But her parents finally had enough
of both of us,

05:04.800 --> 05:07.519
so they petitioned the court
for custody of Jenny for a year.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.352
Just long enough for me and Nicki

05:09.440 --> 05:11.715
to prove that we can
keep our lives together, you know.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.189
Like, keep a job, stay out of trouble.

05:14.280 --> 05:15.872
Here's a slide.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.871
So, wait, Nicki's here?

05:17.960 --> 05:20.030
Yeah. She stays with her folks.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.473
She gets Jenny most of the time.

05:21.560 --> 05:25.269
It took me a while to be okay with that,
but I actually think she's really trying.

05:25.360 --> 05:28.193
Anyways, basically I can't do anything.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.350
No drinking. They drug test me.

05:30.440 --> 05:32.510
I mean, not that that even matters, but...

05:32.600 --> 05:34.397
Like, I can't get a parking ticket.

05:34.480 --> 05:36.994
I just sleep, work,

05:37.360 --> 05:40.875
and hope that in a few months
I'll get custody of Jenny

05:41.400 --> 05:44.358
and then I can start my life again,
you know?

05:56.880 --> 06:00.589
- What are you doing here, Dan?
- Just dealing with the past.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.078
I heard you're home. I wanted to see you.

06:05.840 --> 06:08.149
- You look good.
- You look terrible.

06:08.240 --> 06:10.117
Well, I haven't been sleeping very well.

06:10.200 --> 06:14.273
The truth is, I've been struggling
quite a bit ever since Keith...

06:15.280 --> 06:17.032
I'm trying here, Deb, okay?

06:17.120 --> 06:19.839
I just thought, now that you're back,
and Nathan's moved out,

06:19.920 --> 06:21.797
maybe you're lonely in such a big house.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.199
She's not.

06:24.040 --> 06:27.032
Well, well.
It's the racecar-crashing brother.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.519
Are you staying in my house now, Cooper?

06:28.600 --> 06:30.477
Actually, I'm staying in my sister's house.

06:30.560 --> 06:31.879
And because it is my sister's house,

06:31.960 --> 06:33.996
I don't think we'll be seeing
much of you around here.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.514
Unless, of course, you're invited.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.596
You have a problem with me, kid?

06:39.680 --> 06:42.911
No. But you definitely
have a problem with me.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.998
What the hell is this? Dad, just go home.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.275
I could say the same thing to you, Nathan.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.954
Heard you moved back in with Hades.
I meant, Haley.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.235
Dad, I'm serious. Let's go.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.632
- Don't be a stranger, Cooper.
- Yeah.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.153
Dad, come on.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.479
Welcome home.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.479
Oh, the kid's finally playing well.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.198
Try not to almost kill him
while you're back.

07:06.280 --> 07:09.636
- Just go, Dad.
- I'm going. I'm going.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.797
Dad! What the hell is wrong with you?

07:15.880 --> 07:17.552
Don't you think
maybe Mom's had enough?

07:17.640 --> 07:19.676
- It's my house, Nathan.
- No, it's not.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.671
It's not your house,
and she's not your wife.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.115
Now, damn it, Dad,
you got to stop this crap.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.394
Or what?

07:25.480 --> 07:27.232
I'm the freaking mayor
of this town, Nathan.

07:27.320 --> 07:29.959
I can go wherever the hell I want,
and do whatever the hell I please.

07:30.040 --> 07:31.075
Do you hear me?

07:31.160 --> 07:33.958
Yeah, I hear you.
So do the neighbors, Mr. Mayor.

07:34.240 --> 07:37.118
This is my house. I worked hard to build it.

07:37.200 --> 07:41.318
And if I want, I'll burn
the damn thing down, and everything in it.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.396
He's getting worse, Mom.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.352
He's never gonna change, my dad.

08:01.440 --> 08:04.352
I can totally see him resorting
to the same old manipulative crap.

08:04.440 --> 08:08.115
I'm sorry. I wish I could
just take you away from all that.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.070
- Have you heard from Lucas and Karen?
- No.

08:11.160 --> 08:14.277
Lucas said they were just gonna
get on the road and drive.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.669
I think they probably
just need a break at this point.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.796
Plus, Karen doesn't really want him
around the tournament

08:18.880 --> 08:21.394
- when he can't play, you know.
- Yeah.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.319
Thank you.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.793
You're welcome.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.916
- Does it ever hurt?
- No.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.227
The scar stopped hurting
when my heart stopped hurting,

08:36.320 --> 08:38.788
right around the time you came home.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.029
Okay.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.073
Where'd you go?

08:46.520 --> 08:48.795
Oh, I get it. This is the no-sex thing, right?

08:48.880 --> 08:50.711
- I totally got you, didn't I?
- No.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.553
I told you I was sexy, Haley. Don't lie.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.793
Okay, maybe.

09:15.800 --> 09:17.392
You know that's really not fair.

09:17.480 --> 09:19.232
I mean, it's one thing to break my heart,

09:19.320 --> 09:22.118
but do you have to look like
a beer commercial while you're doing it?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.189
I've been calling you.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.511
Yeah. I just figured
you were busy with Old Man River.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.352
He's not that much older than us.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.396
Come on, Rachel. I'm not an idiot.

09:30.480 --> 09:33.756
Or actually, maybe I am,
thinking you were into me.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.079
I mean, let's see,
we spent a ton of time together.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.196
We flirted, kissed a few times.

09:39.280 --> 09:41.748
Mouth, I didn't mean to lead you on.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.115
It happened anyway, didn't it?

09:44.200 --> 09:48.034
I mean, I said I wasn't gonna fall for you,
but I kissed you

09:48.320 --> 09:50.959
and I woke up wanting to do it again,

09:51.040 --> 09:52.792
and now here we are.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.835
Stop!

09:57.680 --> 09:59.591
I thought witches were supposed to melt.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.240
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- What the hell is wrong with me?

10:02.320 --> 10:04.709
I'm not the freak with the plastic ass
and the tin heart.

10:04.800 --> 10:07.360
No, you're the freak with the fat ass
and no heart.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.032
You know what,
girl formerly known as Orca,

10:09.120 --> 10:10.314
you led Mouth on and you know it.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.960
So maybe it's time you get back in touch
with your inner sperm whale

10:13.040 --> 10:15.076
and realize you now have fewer friends
than you did before.

10:15.160 --> 10:19.233
Really? Well, my new friend Lucas
just called me. Call you lately?

10:19.320 --> 10:20.389
Didn't think so.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.994
You know, Rachel, I would punch you
in your fake nose right now,

10:23.080 --> 10:24.559
but you'd just go out and buy another one.

10:24.640 --> 10:25.834
Enough.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.559
Just... Never mind.

10:30.040 --> 10:32.031
I am gonna make you regret this.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.955
All right. So that building right there,
that's the courthouse.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.634
That's where the judge
scared the crap out of me and Nicki.

10:43.720 --> 10:46.951
Oh, and that alleyway right there,
that's where I threw up

10:47.040 --> 10:48.598
before and after the hearing.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.318
- Good work.
- Yeah.

10:50.720 --> 10:53.075
And that building on the corner there,

10:53.160 --> 10:55.196
that's the
Savannah College of Art and Design.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.508
Didn't throw up there.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.670
I hope not. That place is awesome.

10:58.760 --> 10:59.988
That's what I hear.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.752
And then,
every other building in Savannah

11:01.840 --> 11:05.992
is either haunted by some crazy ghost,
or witch, or gremlin,

11:06.080 --> 11:07.354
or something, I don't know.

11:07.440 --> 11:09.670
Any by a sarcastic goth angel?

11:10.320 --> 11:11.435
What?

11:12.040 --> 11:14.713
Nothing. We all have our ghosts, right?

11:14.800 --> 11:15.994
Yeah.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.319
So anyway, this drink
is like nectar from heaven.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.118
You need to try it.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.475
Okay.

11:26.960 --> 11:28.075
- Jake!
- Yeah?

11:28.160 --> 11:29.434
- Come here.
- Yeah, thanks.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.034
- You're a mess.
- I know, I got it. I got it.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.438
You wanna get some food with that drink?

11:42.280 --> 11:43.474
Yeah.

11:43.760 --> 11:47.878
There's a place right around the corner,
actually. It's pretty good.

11:49.120 --> 11:52.157
I can't believe you squirted Rachel
in the face with her own hose.

11:52.240 --> 11:54.231
She's just lucky
that golf ball didn't hit her.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.470
She probably sucked it out first.

11:56.560 --> 11:57.709
Mouth!

11:59.840 --> 12:02.957
Nathan's hot Uncle Cooper's in town.
Oh, my God, how do I look?

12:03.040 --> 12:04.996
Like Lucas' girlfriend.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.151
Wait a minute. Is that him?

12:08.240 --> 12:09.559
Nice, huh?

12:09.640 --> 12:11.119
I'd love me some Uncle Cooper.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.838
Yeah, well, you're gonna hate this.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.036
Uncle Cooper is Rachel's new boyfriend.

12:15.120 --> 12:18.908
What? No! No! That is not fair!

12:19.000 --> 12:21.230
Okay, can I just reiterate
my whole broken-heart scenario?

12:21.320 --> 12:24.949
But if I had known that he would date
a girl in high school, I mean, I would...

12:25.040 --> 12:27.713
He wouldn't. Mouth, I know Cooper.

12:27.800 --> 12:30.109
There is no way
he would date a high school girl.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.713
But I'm sure that was him.

12:31.800 --> 12:33.791
I'm not saying it wasn't him.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.872
I'm saying he doesn't know
how old Rachel is.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.349
Yet.

12:38.760 --> 12:43.515
I think it's time Franken-Rachel
felt a little of the heartache you're feeling.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.469
Hey, Jake, can I ask you a question?

12:52.720 --> 12:54.278
Look, I know Nicki's around now,

12:54.360 --> 12:56.271
and so I was just wondering,
are you guys...

12:56.360 --> 12:59.909
No. No, but one of the hardest things
for me to accept

13:00.000 --> 13:02.673
was that Nicki and I are always
gonna have Jenny in common,

13:02.760 --> 13:04.716
and that Jenny should know
who her mother is.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.870
- I mean, you can understand that, right?
- Yeah.

13:06.960 --> 13:09.758
But no, no, not together.

13:11.160 --> 13:12.957
How about you? Seeing anybody?

13:13.040 --> 13:16.077
Me? No, I mean, not really.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.279
I was, kind of, dating Pete Wentz
from Fall Out Boy.

13:19.360 --> 13:22.511
Yeah. Well, I've been dating Shakira
most nights,

13:22.600 --> 13:25.160
but she doesn't really know about it.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.754
I'm serious, actually. I just...

13:27.840 --> 13:30.513
It sounds weird,
but it just kind of happened.

13:30.600 --> 13:31.953
That sucks.

13:32.040 --> 13:33.951
I mean, not that you dated a guy,

13:34.040 --> 13:36.349
just that you dated a rock star.

13:37.200 --> 13:38.553
Musicians, they're trouble, you know.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.870
<i>All right, well,</i>
<i>we'd love to start playing for you all</i>

13:40.960 --> 13:44.748
<i>whenever our lead singer decides</i>
<i>to stop flirting with those pretty girls.</i>

13:44.840 --> 13:46.068
<i>Come on, man.</i>

13:46.160 --> 13:47.513
Second job.

13:49.240 --> 13:52.869
I'm telling you,
you got to watch out for those musicians.

13:56.320 --> 13:58.151
<i>How you doing tonight?</i>

14:00.120 --> 14:02.998
<i>So, I wrote this song</i>
<i>for somebody special.</i>

14:03.480 --> 14:05.232
<i>It's called</i> Someday.

16:15.560 --> 16:16.959
You're late.

16:17.240 --> 16:19.595
But I look hot enough
to get away with it, right?

16:19.680 --> 16:20.829
Maybe.

16:25.360 --> 16:26.429
Nice house.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.910
Well, thank you, but it's my sister's.
You want the tour?

16:30.880 --> 16:33.758
Mostly I'm just interested in the bedroom.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.508
That's so not fair. It's upstairs.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.794
Did you know that Savannah
is literally built on the dead?

17:00.880 --> 17:02.950
They placed cemeteries all over the city,

17:03.040 --> 17:05.873
and then as it grew they just,
kind of, built on top of them.

17:05.960 --> 17:08.758
Great, I can't wait to go to bed tonight.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.875
But I guess you're not gonna be there
to protect me, right?

17:14.040 --> 17:17.669
You didn't sleep on the couch last night
because of Jenny, did you?

17:17.760 --> 17:20.991
Peyton, you need to know
that when I saw your face in the airport,

17:21.079 --> 17:23.594
I don't think I've been that happy
since I've been here.

17:23.680 --> 17:24.749
But?

17:25.200 --> 17:27.270
People always leave, right?

17:30.320 --> 17:34.108
There's this on-ramp that I pass every day
on my way to work.

17:34.600 --> 17:37.910
And every day I think,
I could get on that on-ramp,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.151
and I'd be in Tree Hill
in six hours, 24 minutes.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.718
And I'd be with you.
But I'd be without Jenny.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.632
And I can't do that.

17:46.720 --> 17:50.474
You know, you could've called
on the phone and told me that.

17:50.560 --> 17:52.152
It's not like you're in hiding.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.993
It would have been too hard
to hear your voice, Peyton.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.718
To feel us again.

17:57.320 --> 17:59.117
My life is here now.

17:59.600 --> 18:03.070
And as much as I would love to,
you're leaving.

18:03.800 --> 18:06.758
And I'm the one that's gonna be left
with this dull pain in my heart.

18:06.840 --> 18:10.150
And that pain,
it took me a long time to let go of.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.189
Sorry.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.473
It's okay.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.033
Peyton! Peyton!

18:27.280 --> 18:29.111
You know what, every song ends, Jake.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.153
Is that any reason not to enjoy the music?

18:31.240 --> 18:33.913
Forget it. I'll just... I'll see you tomorrow.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.188
You okay?

19:18.400 --> 19:20.391
Yeah, I'm just dreaming.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.473
Oh. I guess the world's still out there.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.477
You know, I have a chance
to make some overtime today

19:27.720 --> 19:29.153
but I can call and cancel if you want.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.434
No, no, no, you should go.
I can spend the day alone.

19:32.440 --> 19:35.079
Or I could make a call
and maybe I can get you Jenny for the day.

19:35.040 --> 19:36.519
Could you really?

19:37.760 --> 19:40.320
Jake, that would be great.
I love that little girl.

19:39.320 --> 19:41.993
I know you do. And I love you for that.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.712
Where's your head at, Peyton?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.673
- Me?
- Yeah.

19:50.160 --> 19:52.116
I'm all over the place.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.075
I don't know, it's just like...

19:54.120 --> 19:56.429
Like, you know that feeling
you get on a Sunday

19:56.600 --> 19:59.672
where you just had the whole day
to yourself and it's been great,

19:59.000 --> 20:01.389
and then you remember you have to
go to school the next day,

20:02.160 --> 20:04.594
so it ruins the rest of the night?

20:04.640 --> 20:08.155
I have to go home tomorrow
and so I've got that feeling.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.312
It's like Sunday night.

20:11.720 --> 20:15.872
You know, somebody once told me
that every song ends,

20:13.400 --> 20:15.755
but that's no reason
not to enjoy the music.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.679
Ellie told me that.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.437
Well, she was right.

20:22.200 --> 20:25.397
Tomorrow's gonna hurt like hell.
We both know that.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.590
But we're here together now.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.553
Marvin McFabulous.
I wasn't sure you were gonna make it.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.479
Actually, I got here early.

20:37.080 --> 20:39.594
Well, welcome to the dark side, my friend.

20:38.480 --> 20:42.075
Deception for lunch, payback for dinner,
and pie for breakfast?

20:41.080 --> 20:43.036
You guys want some breakfast?

20:44.760 --> 20:45.829
Pie.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.279
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.038
Just a cup of coffee, please.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.598
Hot Uncle Cooper!

20:52.680 --> 20:54.432
Well, why don't you come and join us?

20:55.640 --> 20:57.471
- Hey, Brooke.
- Hi.

20:57.480 --> 21:00.358
- Hey, I'm Cooper.
- Hey. I'm Steve.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.789
Yeah, you're
the flower delivery guy, right?

21:02.360 --> 21:03.998
- How's it going?
- Oh, I've been better.

21:04.840 --> 21:07.115
You know, my girl never did say
who those flowers were from.

21:06.560 --> 21:09.711
She wouldn't tell you?
She sounds like a shady character.

21:08.920 --> 21:11.514
No, no, I just think
it was personal, that's all.

21:12.160 --> 21:15.470
All she'd say was that they were
from somebody she really cared about.

21:14.840 --> 21:16.478
Look, we all have our histories, right?

21:18.240 --> 21:21.357
I don't know, I just think
this guy must've meant something to her.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.554
Anyway, you guys
don't wanna hear about that.

21:23.160 --> 21:25.754
So this is like home court
for you two, right? What's good here?

21:25.840 --> 21:29.628
I ordered the pie,
but I don't think I have the stomach for it.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.635
But...

21:32.400 --> 21:34.595
This new girlfriend,
you care about her, right?

21:33.600 --> 21:34.953
Yeah, I do.

21:35.880 --> 21:38.519
That's good. Take care of her.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.749
Okay.

21:40.760 --> 21:43.320
Mouth, what about the plan?

21:44.920 --> 21:47.673
Payback. Pain. Pie. She is lying to him.

21:47.560 --> 21:50.711
I know.
But I got to talk to Rachel first, okay?

21:50.400 --> 21:52.152
I really wanted pie.

21:55.880 --> 21:56.995
Hey.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.997
How you feeling, sleepyhead?

22:02.720 --> 22:04.790
- Like ass.
- Sorry.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.910
Lucky for you, this cures that.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.799
I hope so.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.313
Oh, thank you.

22:12.640 --> 22:14.198
I am wiped out.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.918
We just got to win
this one last game though,

22:18.320 --> 22:21.995
otherwise Whitey has to retire
without making the playoffs.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.395
Well, we can't let that happen.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.355
- Where does it hurt?
- Everywhere.

22:27.600 --> 22:29.238
You guys are playing Oak Lake tonight?

22:31.680 --> 22:33.671
Yeah. They're undefeated.

22:33.400 --> 22:36.073
And my boyfriend Damien West,
is he good?

22:35.760 --> 22:38.479
Yeah, he's pretty good.
He's an ass though.

22:38.520 --> 22:41.193
Sort of like a young version of my dad.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.469
You know, it's actually hurt me

22:44.600 --> 22:47.637
to see what's happened
to your relationship with Dan.

22:45.840 --> 22:46.955
I just...

22:49.240 --> 22:50.912
Especially now that you're playing so well,

22:50.440 --> 22:53.000
you should be able to enjoy that
with your father.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.316
Yeah, it's a little late for that though.

22:54.840 --> 22:55.989
Probably just as well.

22:57.040 --> 23:00.112
With the way I've been feeling, I don't
think I have another great game in me.

22:58.280 --> 23:00.714
I don't believe that for a second.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.556
Besides, I'm gonna help you.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.595
And Damien West doesn't stand a chance.

23:06.600 --> 23:09.910
- I love you, you know that?
- I love you, too.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.632
You always help me.

23:12.280 --> 23:16.751
Damn it, you need to put a shirt on.
Too sexy. God!

23:16.360 --> 23:18.351
Take a look at this building,
right over here.

23:22.040 --> 23:26.113
That's where Daddy fought for you
and then he threw up in the alley.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.031
And then right over here

23:28.280 --> 23:30.714
is the Savannah College of Art and Design,

23:30.280 --> 23:32.157
where maybe I'll go one day.

23:36.960 --> 23:40.157
That way I can spend more time
with you and Daddy.

23:38.920 --> 23:41.275
How's it feel
knowing your man's season ends tonight?

23:47.440 --> 23:49.715
You smell great.
Can't wait to see how you taste.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.233
Get off me!

23:51.440 --> 23:53.715
It's okay. Give in to it, baby.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.995
Hey. Damien West. Dan Scott.

23:55.800 --> 23:57.677
That's Mayor Dan Scott.

23:59.160 --> 24:01.720
And if you ever touch
my daughter-in-law Haley again,

24:02.280 --> 24:04.077
I'll end your career.

24:04.240 --> 24:05.878
Have a good game.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.552
Jake? We're home.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.557
Hey, there's my girl.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.918
- Oh, come on. Come to Daddy.
- Go see Dada.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.870
So how was your day? Okay?

24:19.680 --> 24:21.511
People always leave, right?

24:27.480 --> 24:29.869
I mean, like,
that's why you and I can't be together,

24:29.640 --> 24:31.915
because you have to stay
and I have to go back to Tree Hill.

24:31.560 --> 24:34.632
But I was thinking,
why do I have to go back?

24:34.040 --> 24:36.600
Jake, I wanna stay.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.516
I wanna stay here with you.

24:40.600 --> 24:41.999
Hey, Nathan.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.268
Nathan!

24:49.360 --> 24:50.793
Look, Dad...

24:52.880 --> 24:54.313
What is this?

24:54.800 --> 24:58.952
You said you were gonna back off, Dan.
With me and with Nathan.

24:57.440 --> 24:58.919
A restraining order?

24:59.640 --> 25:03.076
It requires you to stay
at least 100 feet away from us at all times.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.838
Starting tonight.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.398
Sorry, Mr. Mayor.

25:09.280 --> 25:11.236
- You sign off on this, Nathan?
- Yeah.

25:11.680 --> 25:13.955
Actually, Dad, it was my idea.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.160
All night, Scott. You can't stop me.

25:17.640 --> 25:20.712
Take a look at the scoreboard.
In case you can't count, it's tied.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.390
Come on, Damien. This guy owns you.

25:48.920 --> 25:49.989
Oops!

25:53.000 --> 25:55.434
- You did that on purpose!
- Hey, bitch, get off me!

25:58.360 --> 26:00.237
Hey, break it up! Break it up!

25:59.520 --> 26:01.511
Break it up! You guys, break it up!

26:02.520 --> 26:04.158
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.837
<i>The refs appear to have it</i>
<i>under control now.</i>

26:08.120 --> 26:10.680
<i>Nathan Scott steps to the line</i>
<i>for two free throws.</i>

26:10.960 --> 26:13.235
Okay, gentlemen, let's get set.

26:12.840 --> 26:15.149
Shooting two, first one's dead.

26:15.560 --> 26:18.393
Hold on, guys, I've got blood here. Coach!

26:19.000 --> 26:22.072
<i>And it looks like</i>
<i>Nathan has some blood on his jersey.</i>

26:21.520 --> 26:23.317
<i>Let's hope it's not serious.</i>

26:24.640 --> 26:27.791
- He needs stitches.
- Sorry, son. You're done for the night.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.677
What? No way, forget it.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.394
Nathan, you're bleeding.

26:38.360 --> 26:40.316
Coach, there's no way
I'm leaving this game.

26:40.320 --> 26:42.754
- Now, if I need stitches, then stitch me up.
- Nathan.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.477
Coach, if we lose this game,

26:43.720 --> 26:46.314
then you lose your shot
at the State Championships, and so do I.

26:46.240 --> 26:47.389
And so does this team.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.872
Now we played
in your crappy old gym, okay?

26:50.800 --> 26:52.631
We ran two-a-days until we puked.

26:52.040 --> 26:54.076
I let Tim shower with me.

26:53.880 --> 26:57.714
Come on. Don't let a punk
like Damien West take this away from us.

26:55.800 --> 26:59.793
All right, take him back there
and stitch him up, find him another jersey.

26:57.920 --> 27:01.469
If his mother says anything about this,
it was your idea.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.793
Get in there!

27:11.440 --> 27:14.034
What the hell are you laughing at?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.633
Two things I know.

27:24.400 --> 27:27.073
One, you don't deserve a guy like Mouth.

27:27.400 --> 27:32.110
And two, deception
always catches up to you. Always.

27:28.920 --> 27:31.832
<i>It looks like Nathan Scott</i>
<i>is gonna have to leave the game.</i>

27:31.760 --> 27:34.354
<i>We'll take a break and be right back.</i>

27:39.400 --> 27:40.515
Hey.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.278
- Who's winning?
- It's tied. Fourth quarter.

27:46.640 --> 27:49.598
So, you wanna tell me
about this master plan of yours?

27:49.960 --> 27:52.554
What makes you think
that you can actually leave Tree Hill?

27:55.560 --> 27:58.757
Well, I'm gonna be out of high school
in a couple months anyway, right?

27:58.600 --> 28:01.114
So I can just get my GED now.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.794
And the College of Art and Design
is a great school.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.994
And, I mean, my dad's always gone.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.630
Haley has Nathan. And Brooke has Lucas.

28:09.760 --> 28:11.478
So maybe I can stay.

28:12.640 --> 28:16.474
You know, Peyton, there's a reason
that you're listening to that game tonight.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.236
And I don't care what you say,
you'd miss it. All of it.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.274
- Do you miss it?
- Every day.

28:22.680 --> 28:23.829
Jake?

28:26.040 --> 28:27.598
Do you love me?

28:33.520 --> 28:34.919
Yeah, I do.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.631
I walked around Savannah all day today

28:39.760 --> 28:43.355
and I couldn't shake that feeling
of it being a Sunday evening.

28:42.720 --> 28:45.234
And it's always gonna be without you.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.552
You're the one
that makes that feeling go away.

28:48.480 --> 28:52.678
So, yes, there are things about my life
that I would miss.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.957
But I'd miss you more.

28:52.920 --> 28:57.232
<i>And the roar you hear is for Nathan Scott</i>
<i>stepping back onto the court!</i>

28:57.920 --> 29:00.593
<i>And he's wearing Lucas Scott's jersey!</i>

29:22.320 --> 29:23.912
<i>But is it too late?</i>

29:27.280 --> 29:29.635
<i>The Ravens trail by nine,</i>
<i>with just over a minute left.</i>

29:32.480 --> 29:35.438
Should've stayed in the locker room,
Scott. Your season's over.

29:34.160 --> 29:35.388
We'll see about that.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.910
Yes! Yeah, Nathan!

29:39.880 --> 29:43.111
<i>Another three by Nathan,</i>
<i>and just like that the Ravens trail by three.</i>

29:54.720 --> 29:55.948
<i>Thirty-five seconds left!</i>

30:03.440 --> 30:05.715
<i>Let's hope there's some magic</i>
<i>still left in that jersey.</i>

30:06.760 --> 30:09.797
What's the matter, West?
You don't wanna take the big shot?

30:08.080 --> 30:09.195
Ball.

30:13.240 --> 30:16.710
Well, well. Someone has to make
their free throws, huh?

30:16.360 --> 30:18.112
Don't brick it now.

30:24.200 --> 30:26.998
Take it easy, man. It's an old backboard.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.957
That's right. Nice and easy.
Don't think about it.

30:40.320 --> 30:42.356
Wow. Nice touch.

30:45.840 --> 30:48.718
<i>And the Ravens are gonna get</i>
<i>the ball back, down by three,</i>

30:54.040 --> 30:57.919
<i>with 18 seconds on the clock</i>
<i>and Nathan Scott on fire.</i>

30:58.680 --> 31:03.037
<i>I'm telling you, folks, win or lose,</i>
<i>you're gonna regret missing this one.</i>

31:01.640 --> 31:06.236
<i>The two teams are huddled up now.</i>
<i>We'll get back to live action in a moment.</i>

31:05.600 --> 31:06.828
All right, listen to me.

31:10.040 --> 31:12.031
That Scott kid
is having the game of his life,

31:15.880 --> 31:17.029
so they'll be going to him.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.918
When he catches the ball, you foul him.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.999
They'll only get two free throws
and they're down by three.

31:20.520 --> 31:22.875
- I can stop him, Coach.
- No way, it's too risky.

31:22.320 --> 31:25.392
We foul him, we end their season,
we get out of here undefeated.

31:25.120 --> 31:26.951
Now let's go, fellows.

31:27.560 --> 31:29.676
- Win on three. One, two, three!
- Win!

31:30.720 --> 31:33.996
Now, you listen to me. When you
step out on that floor, take it all in.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.310
Because someday you're gonna
look back on it and want it all again.

31:35.200 --> 31:38.397
When you do,
make sure it's for the right reasons.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.279
Win or lose, leave it all on the floor.

31:41.960 --> 31:43.757
Now, Ravens on three.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.918
- One, two, three!
- Ravens!

31:48.200 --> 31:50.555
<i>You know, it's been said</i>
<i>that we just don't recognize</i>

31:50.440 --> 31:53.352
<i>the significant moments of our lives</i>
<i>while they're happening.</i>

31:54.680 --> 31:59.435
<i>We grow complacent with ideas or things</i>
<i>or people and we take them for granted.</i>

31:57.120 --> 32:00.476
<i>And it's usually not until that thing</i>
<i>is about to be taken away from you</i>

32:00.120 --> 32:02.076
<i>that you realize how wrong you've been.</i>

32:06.000 --> 32:08.355
<i>That you realize how much</i>
<i>you really need it.</i>

32:09.440 --> 32:11.237
<i>How much you love it.</i>

32:11.480 --> 32:13.072
<i>God, I love this game.</i>

32:13.920 --> 32:15.831
Foul him! Foul!

32:16.000 --> 32:18.116
No way, nobody fouls him. He's mine.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.956
Come on, Scott. You got nothing.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.479
We got a foul here.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.756
Foul? Come on, ref!

32:30.640 --> 32:31.834
<i>Foul! They called a foul!</i>

32:34.520 --> 32:37.830
<i>The shot is good, the game is tied</i>
<i>and there's a foul on Damien West!</i>

32:36.640 --> 32:37.868
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

32:37.920 --> 32:39.319
Come on, ref!

32:41.320 --> 32:44.710
<i>Nathan Scott will get one free throw</i>
<i>to win it with no time left on the clock!</i>

32:42.800 --> 32:46.873
<i>So Nathan Scott will have</i>
<i>one free throw to win it for the Ravens!</i>

32:44.280 --> 32:46.874
Okay, you need to make
20 free throws in a row.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.071
You miss one, we start over.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.112
But, Dad, I'm tired.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.110
Nathan, I'm only trying
to make you better.

33:02.120 --> 33:04.793
Someday you're gonna thank me for this.

33:04.080 --> 33:08.198
<i>You ever heard the expression,</i>
<i>"The best things in life are free"?</i>

33:06.240 --> 33:08.276
<i>Well, that expression's true.</i>

33:17.640 --> 33:19.517
<i>Okay, this is it.</i>

33:22.000 --> 33:23.115
Oh...

33:24.360 --> 33:26.669
You got nothing, Scott. Nothing!

33:29.240 --> 33:31.435
<i>Ravens win it! Ravens win it!</i>

33:50.720 --> 33:52.950
So you've been quiet tonight.

34:03.280 --> 34:05.475
- I'm worried about you.
- Why?

34:50.679 --> 34:52.476
What if I say you can stay,

34:54.320 --> 34:57.676
and somehow we convince your father
to let you do it?

34:58.920 --> 35:00.990
This life is hard, Peyton.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.279
You got all this fire inside of you.

35:05.160 --> 35:07.390
I just... I don't want to be the guy
that puts that out.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.950
Well, you already did that.
The night you left Tree Hill.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.998
I spent a lot of time being miserable, Jake.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.749
It's like misery's an old friend.

35:17.800 --> 35:22.430
And it tricks you sometimes into thinking
that it's just always gonna be there,

35:21.160 --> 35:23.116
and that you can't be happy.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.953
But you can.
You can walk away from pain.

35:28.920 --> 35:32.151
And I think
being in love's the best way to do it.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.559
What do you feel when we're together?

35:36.360 --> 35:37.475
Hope.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.233
I do, too.

35:44.280 --> 35:46.077
And we deserve that.

35:47.320 --> 35:49.197
- You okay?
- Not really.

35:49.520 --> 35:52.159
I kind of got caught in a lie tonight.

36:08.320 --> 36:09.719
With Cooper?

36:12.400 --> 36:13.913
About your age?

36:15.240 --> 36:17.310
I didn't tell him anything.

36:16.840 --> 36:18.114
Why not?

36:20.800 --> 36:24.475
Because if he makes you feel
the way that I felt with you,

36:24.640 --> 36:26.676
then I want that for you.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.512
Brooke was right.

36:34.720 --> 36:36.517
I don't deserve you.

36:38.120 --> 36:39.758
I'm sorry, Mouth.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.349
Never say you're sorry, Rachel.

36:44.040 --> 36:46.873
I mean, that was one of your rules, right?

36:46.960 --> 36:48.712
It's a stupid rule.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.951
Maybe today's that day.

36:56.600 --> 36:58.955
Hey. You were great tonight.

36:59.040 --> 37:00.712
Yeah, I think so.

37:03.360 --> 37:04.588
Nathan.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.830
I know, I know.
I'm not supposed to get close to you.

37:16.880 --> 37:20.555
But tonight I walked into that gym
the Mayor of Tree Hill,

37:19.880 --> 37:21.916
but I finished the night

37:21.880 --> 37:24.440
a father on the outside, looking in

37:27.280 --> 37:29.510
at a son who deserves better.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.792
I wanted to tell you

37:33.160 --> 37:35.037
how proud of you I am.

37:37.360 --> 37:40.193
And this has nothing to do
with basketball.

37:42.360 --> 37:45.875
I'm proud of you
for the choices you've made with your life.

37:45.120 --> 37:48.237
I'm proud of you
for the man that you've become.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.153
I love you.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.795
<i>Every once in a while, people step up.</i>

37:56.120 --> 37:58.236
<i>They rise above themselves.</i>

38:02.920 --> 38:05.115
<i>Sometimes they surprise you.</i>

38:09.240 --> 38:10.639
Okay, you can't be here.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.558
- All right, Cooper...
- How could you lie like that, huh?

38:14.400 --> 38:17.517
How old are you?
Please tell me you're not a freshman.

38:17.320 --> 38:18.355
I'm 17.

38:18.800 --> 38:22.315
And just relax. In North Carolina,
I only have to be 16 for us to be together.

38:21.840 --> 38:23.114
Yeah, maybe by law,

38:25.040 --> 38:28.715
but in my book, you gotta be
a hell of a lot older than that.

38:26.160 --> 38:28.230
You have to go. I'm sorry.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.273
- Cooper...
- Don't.

38:31.120 --> 38:33.588
You know you still want me, Cooper.

38:38.040 --> 38:39.473
You know it,

38:43.240 --> 38:44.719
and I know it.

38:51.240 --> 38:53.037
You really should go.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.870
<i>And sometimes they fall short.</i>

39:01.160 --> 39:04.311
<i>Life is funny sometimes.</i>
<i>It can push pretty hard.</i>

39:09.680 --> 39:12.558
<i>But if you look close enough,</i>
<i>you find hope.</i>

39:23.360 --> 39:25.351
<i>In the words of children,</i>

39:32.080 --> 39:33.911
<i>in the bars of a song.</i>

39:37.400 --> 39:39.197
What's wrong, Peyton?

39:43.720 --> 39:46.234
<i>And in the eyes of someone you love.</i>

39:49.400 --> 39:51.152
<i>And if you're lucky,</i>

39:55.480 --> 39:59.268
<i>I mean, if you're the luckiest person</i>
<i>on this entire planet,</i>

39:57.720 --> 40:00.678
<i>the person you love</i>
<i>decides to love you back.</i>

40:15.440 --> 40:17.431
Do you wanna get married?

40:17.400 --> 40:18.389
