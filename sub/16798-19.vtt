WEBVTT

00:04.447 --> 00:06.548
Hey. You couldn't sleep?

00:06.549 --> 00:10.152
Well, I stared at the
ceiling for an hour.

00:10.153 --> 00:11.286
That's my limit.

00:11.287 --> 00:13.288
What was it? The drought in Somalia?

00:13.289 --> 00:15.123
No, Somalia made a valiant effort

00:15.124 --> 00:16.525
to get in the game, but no,

00:16.526 --> 00:19.127
this morning it is Russian veiling.

00:19.128 --> 00:21.029
What's that? Some new
kind of hacking software?

00:21.030 --> 00:23.698
Not hacking, hatmaking.

00:24.767 --> 00:25.867
It's a course at Hutner.

00:25.868 --> 00:31.506
You're obsessing
over college acceptances

00:31.507 --> 00:33.475
'cause that big e-mail
blast goes out this week.

00:33.476 --> 00:36.444
And by "obsessing" I mean, of course,

00:36.445 --> 00:38.079
showing the appropriate
amount of interest

00:38.080 --> 00:40.081
- for a concerned parent.
- Yeah. Thank you.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.817
But wait, Hutner is
Alison's third choice.

00:41.818 --> 00:43.351
I thought we were
confident about Rafferty.

00:43.352 --> 00:46.721
We are. We're confident... ish.

00:47.890 --> 00:49.958
I mean, her mom's secretary
of state, after all.

00:49.959 --> 00:51.927
And they protested when we visited.

00:51.928 --> 00:55.764
So, in the unlikely event
that she doesn't get in,

00:55.765 --> 00:58.266
I want to have something good
to say about her other choices.

00:58.267 --> 01:01.870
Like, in addition to fashion design,

01:01.871 --> 01:05.140
Bayard offers this whole...

01:05.141 --> 01:08.043
Omnipreneur program.

01:08.044 --> 01:10.312
Omnipreneur?

01:10.313 --> 01:12.948
- My God.
- Something about global markets...

01:12.949 --> 01:16.151
I don't know, branding
power and party hats.

01:16.152 --> 01:18.987
- I don't know.
- I just can't keep up with the language.

01:18.988 --> 01:21.443
When does the e-mail from
Rafferty go out again?

01:21.448 --> 01:23.458
Thursday at 5:00.

01:23.459 --> 01:25.794
Come on, you're gonna be
there, right? We promised.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.096
It's been in my calendar
for, like, six months.

01:28.097 --> 01:30.031
And Stevie hears

01:30.032 --> 01:32.052
from Harvard Law this week, too, right?

01:32.053 --> 01:35.727
Did you make a... thumbs up for
other choices list for her, too?

01:35.728 --> 01:38.221
She aced her LSATs and she
has a letter of recommendation

01:38.222 --> 01:39.790
from the White House chief of staff.

01:39.791 --> 01:41.625
And her mom's secretary of state.

01:41.626 --> 01:43.160
It's a lock.

01:43.161 --> 01:45.327
Ish.

01:47.998 --> 01:50.000
- Good morning, everyone.
- Morning.

01:50.001 --> 01:51.101
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:51.102 --> 01:52.669
Hey. I have been up since 5:00.

01:52.670 --> 01:55.505
I am fully caffeinated
and ready to crush

01:55.506 --> 01:57.574
this food aid procurement intervention.

01:57.575 --> 01:58.809
Where are we on Somalia?

01:58.810 --> 02:02.979
The situation in the southern
portion of the country

02:02.980 --> 02:04.414
is still dire.

02:04.415 --> 02:05.515
There's a record heat wave

02:05.516 --> 02:08.485
and the bumper crop
from 2012 is depleted.

02:08.485 --> 02:10.387
And just to make things
interesting, two rebel groups,

02:10.388 --> 02:11.588
the Somali Independence Front

02:11.589 --> 02:13.356
and the Revolutionary Army of Somalia

02:13.357 --> 02:16.726
are both laying claim to the
last few acres of arable land.

02:16.727 --> 02:20.263
Leaving the village of
Saakow caught in the middle.

02:20.264 --> 02:22.732
Add no water, instant famine.

02:22.733 --> 02:24.901
If it goes unchecked, 50,000 people

02:24.902 --> 02:27.037
will starve to death
in a matter of weeks.

02:27.038 --> 02:28.505
Apologies for my tardiness.

02:29.807 --> 02:32.075
Have our boats docked in Mogadishu

02:32.076 --> 02:33.543
with the food aid?

02:33.544 --> 02:34.845
Yeah, I got word a couple hours ago.

02:34.846 --> 02:37.080
Global Relief Guild is loading the grain

02:37.081 --> 02:38.315
- onto trucks for delivery.
- Okay.

02:38.316 --> 02:40.617
You remember Anis Musse
from the Africa desk?

02:40.618 --> 02:44.421
I... yes. He left to go work for an NGO.

02:44.422 --> 02:45.388
That's right.

02:45.389 --> 02:46.957
He landed at Global Relief Guild.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.764
He's overseeing the
distribution of food.

02:48.765 --> 02:49.759
Well, that's great.

02:49.760 --> 02:52.863
That means that we will
have reliable communication

02:52.864 --> 02:53.930
on the ground.

02:53.931 --> 02:56.066
All right. Crisis averted so far.

02:56.067 --> 02:57.868
But there's one more immediate problem.

02:57.869 --> 03:00.604
Yes, there is, always, always.

03:00.605 --> 03:04.040
Dito Pirosmani, former
Soviet military officer

03:04.041 --> 03:05.442
and current owner of a pseudo-legit

03:05.443 --> 03:06.743
Georgian chemical company.

03:06.744 --> 03:11.081
He also sells Russian
weapons on the black market.

03:11.082 --> 03:14.351
Let me guess.

03:14.352 --> 03:16.019
He's armed one of the
Somali rebel groups.

03:16.020 --> 03:18.688
Nope. He's armed both.

03:18.689 --> 03:20.423
Way to cover the waterfront.

03:20.424 --> 03:22.425
Word on the street is
he just sold them each

03:22.426 --> 03:25.462
a cache of old AK-47s he
boosted out of Ukraine.

03:25.463 --> 03:26.997
Point being, these
guys asked for new toys

03:26.998 --> 03:28.738
and they're gonna want to
start playing with them.

03:28.739 --> 03:32.769
And if fighting breaks out,
that will leave Saakow cut off.

03:32.770 --> 03:35.138
GRG won't be able to
get the food through.

03:35.139 --> 03:36.740
Well, can't we shut him down?

03:36.741 --> 03:39.109
Well, he does his best to
skirt the U.S. legal system.

03:39.110 --> 03:40.777
Steers clear of American-made hardware

03:40.778 --> 03:42.379
and won't sell to terrorists.

03:42.380 --> 03:45.182
CIA keeps a file active,
but he's not a priority,

03:45.183 --> 03:47.250
though he doesn't know that.

03:47.251 --> 03:49.719
Ma'am, it's almost time for
your meeting at the White House.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.121
Thanks, Blake.

03:51.122 --> 03:53.390
All right. Let's-let's
really stay on top of this.

03:53.391 --> 03:56.126
I want updates every
couple hours, all right?

03:56.127 --> 03:57.760
Thank you.

04:00.163 --> 04:01.631
Any updates on that other thing?

04:01.632 --> 04:03.733
Well, I've just started
my research, but so far,

04:03.734 --> 04:06.903
Clifton University's
colors are brown and yellow.

04:06.904 --> 04:10.207
Their mascot is the Mighty Woodchuck.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.375
They have a Fondue Fridays

04:12.376 --> 04:14.778
on the student grill every... Friday.

04:14.779 --> 04:18.447
It's kind of a retro, '70s
vibe with a disco ball and...

04:20.483 --> 04:21.685
Brown and yellow?

04:21.685 --> 04:24.020
It's so horrifying,
I can't even tell you.

04:24.021 --> 04:25.255
- Thank God it's her safety.
- I...

04:25.256 --> 04:27.724
Now, after his meeting

04:27.725 --> 04:29.793
with Secretary McCord, Mr. Fox provided

04:29.794 --> 04:32.329
unfettered access to
his corporate finances.

04:32.330 --> 04:36.199
Based on the SWIFT-BIC code,
the $500,000 retainer was wired

04:36.200 --> 04:39.035
to Mr. Fox from an offshore
account in the Caymans.

04:39.036 --> 04:41.338
We're wired into the account,

04:41.339 --> 04:43.206
so if he sells our stolen
weapons on the black market

04:43.207 --> 04:45.208
and uses the dummy
corp to receive payment,

04:45.209 --> 04:46.576
I'll be able to trace the transfer.

04:46.577 --> 04:47.644
And it might be helpful

04:47.645 --> 04:50.447
to know how much of our hardware he has

04:50.448 --> 04:51.448
in his possession.

04:51.449 --> 04:53.950
FBI completed their inventory

04:53.951 --> 04:55.752
of the Texas compound this morning.

04:55.753 --> 04:58.555
Please, keep us informed
of your progress, Captain.

04:58.556 --> 05:02.158
I will do, sir.

05:02.159 --> 05:03.826
Thank you, Mr. President.

05:08.498 --> 05:11.801
I'm afraid it's worse than we thought.

05:11.802 --> 05:13.837
Munitions scheduled for destruction

05:13.838 --> 05:15.972
were being siphoned off to transports

05:15.973 --> 05:18.174
for at least seven months

05:18.175 --> 05:19.943
without detection.

05:19.944 --> 05:24.281
In addition to artillery
shells and ammunition,

05:24.282 --> 05:28.518
35 portable anti-aircraft
missiles are gone.

05:28.519 --> 05:31.655
180 sniper rifles,

05:31.656 --> 05:34.557
250 M16s,

05:34.558 --> 05:36.793
28 AT4s, plus two drones

05:36.794 --> 05:41.431
identical to the one
Henry's asset identified

05:41.432 --> 05:42.732
at the Virginia Field Force compound.

05:42.733 --> 05:46.169
FBI arrested eight VFF
members in that raid.

05:46.170 --> 05:48.104
Did any of them meet with the seller?

05:48.105 --> 05:51.374
Maybe they could give us a
name or a physical description?

05:51.375 --> 05:53.576
Reverend Slattery took the meeting solo

05:53.577 --> 05:54.711
and he's in the wind.

05:54.712 --> 05:57.414
But we recovered some notes.

05:57.415 --> 06:01.217
Slattery left behind in which
he identified the unnamed seller

06:01.218 --> 06:03.420
as "college boy."

06:03.421 --> 06:08.992
We think he may be referring
to Anton Jankovic...

06:08.993 --> 06:10.794
an American citizen

06:10.795 --> 06:12.896
of Serbian descent.

06:12.897 --> 06:16.666
His father was an exporter,
and Anton started moving weapons

06:16.667 --> 06:18.368
through his dad's shipments

06:18.369 --> 06:20.370
while he was still a
junior at Princeton.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.941
Excuse me, Madam Secretary, your office

06:24.942 --> 06:26.810
is asking you to come
back as soon as possible.

06:26.811 --> 06:28.511
They said it's about the food delivery.

06:28.512 --> 06:31.747
I'm guessing that's
not your lunch order.

06:33.450 --> 06:36.119
The convoy was almost to Saakow
when we were run off the road

06:36.120 --> 06:37.954
by the Revolutionary Army of Somalia.

06:37.955 --> 06:39.456
Anyone hurt?

06:39.457 --> 06:42.359
They had guns, but they didn't
fire at us, just took the food.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.195
But GRG has a line on
emergency food products

06:45.196 --> 06:47.864
from USAID's PREPO facility in Dubai.

06:47.865 --> 06:50.333
If you can ship it here
and provide security,

06:50.334 --> 06:52.335
I'll take another ride out to Saakow.

06:52.336 --> 06:54.704
We'll get into it.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.906
You're a badass. We
miss you around here.

06:56.907 --> 06:58.340
Thanks, ma'am.

06:59.776 --> 07:01.745
I know federal law requires

07:01.746 --> 07:04.047
we use U.S. shipping lines
to deliver the food aid,

07:04.048 --> 07:06.268
but that could be another
two weeks, conservatively.

07:06.269 --> 07:08.084
Thousands of people
will already be dead.

07:08.085 --> 07:10.787
We need to get the Senate
to pass an emergency waiver,

07:10.788 --> 07:12.856
bypass the shipping rule

07:12.857 --> 07:14.257
and fly all the food from Dubai.

07:14.258 --> 07:15.892
Congress is hard-line
about those rules.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.927
Farm and shipping lobbies

07:17.928 --> 07:20.897
are, um... hold a lot of sway.

07:20.898 --> 07:24.701
Get me ten minutes

07:24.702 --> 07:26.835
with the Senate majority leader now.

07:28.571 --> 07:31.808
Mr. Leader.

07:31.809 --> 07:33.276
Madam Secretary.

07:33.277 --> 07:36.179
I understand you want
to plead your case,

07:36.180 --> 07:40.917
but we have these food
aid rules for a reason.

07:40.918 --> 07:45.455
Yes, to, subsidize U.S.
farmers so they can sell off

07:45.456 --> 07:46.790
their grain overages.

07:46.791 --> 07:47.957
Now, that's a very simplistic...

07:47.958 --> 07:52.095
And to give U.S. shipping
companies a monopoly

07:52.096 --> 07:55.231
so they can overcharge and
under perform on delivery.

07:55.232 --> 07:59.068
It is a... inefficient
and wasteful system.

07:59.069 --> 08:02.205
Welcome to the United States government,

08:02.206 --> 08:04.474
I'm afraid.

08:04.475 --> 08:08.011
All right, but the thing is, Senator...

08:08.012 --> 08:11.681
in the last Somali famine,
260,000 people starved to death,

08:12.808 --> 08:16.085
and half of them were
children under five.

08:16.086 --> 08:20.557
And they died just because the
world waited too long to act.

08:20.558 --> 08:23.026
We all have our priorities.

08:23.027 --> 08:25.595
Yours is to feed the world.

08:25.596 --> 08:28.765
Mine is to protect American farms

08:28.766 --> 08:31.167
and American jobs.

08:31.168 --> 08:36.306
That said, no one wants to
see women and children suffer,

08:36.307 --> 08:38.775
and it hurts my heart to turn you down.

08:38.775 --> 08:41.910
Yes, I can see that.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.712
Speaking of being turned down,

08:43.714 --> 08:48.518
I made a request last month
of the Department of Defense

08:48.519 --> 08:53.356
to use your plane for a
fact-finding trip this weekend,

08:53.357 --> 08:55.458
but they said no.

08:55.459 --> 08:57.594
Well, I... Mr. Leader,

08:57.595 --> 09:01.531
you and I both know that
is DOD's prerogative.

09:01.532 --> 09:05.368
Nevertheless, I've been
greatly inconvenienced.

09:05.369 --> 09:09.072
Now, if the secretary of state

09:09.073 --> 09:11.441
were to put in a word on my behalf,

09:11.442 --> 09:15.378
I'm sure DOD would shake loose a jet.

09:15.379 --> 09:18.047
And then I might be inclined

09:18.048 --> 09:21.817
to help you with your request.

09:23.586 --> 09:27.524
So... if I call DOD,

09:27.525 --> 09:30.560
you will pass the emergency waiver?

09:30.561 --> 09:34.998
I'll put your waiver up
for a vote this morning.

09:34.999 --> 09:39.669
I'm sure it will pass
with bipartisan support.

09:39.670 --> 09:43.406
We all like to help out when we can.

09:43.407 --> 09:46.075
Don't we?

09:46.076 --> 09:48.377
Wow.

09:50.446 --> 09:52.615
You know, I-I'm just curious.

09:52.616 --> 09:56.252
Where are you going on
your fact-finding trip?

09:56.253 --> 09:59.856
Cabo San Lucas.

09:59.857 --> 10:03.358
The beaches are eroding.

10:05.328 --> 10:07.363
We've been interrogating

10:07.364 --> 10:10.867
the captured members of
the Virginia Field Force,

10:10.868 --> 10:12.569
but it's slow going.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.537
Why is that?

10:14.538 --> 10:18.841
The VFF was not a typical
anti-government militia.

10:18.842 --> 10:20.577
Once they merged with Covenant of John,

10:20.578 --> 10:21.911
they became a doomsday cult.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.414
So, we're not just
questioning these men,

10:24.415 --> 10:25.982
we're deprogramming them.

10:25.983 --> 10:26.950
It takes time.

10:26.951 --> 10:28.551
Then what about your asset?

10:28.552 --> 10:30.286
Once Agent Conroy was detoxed,

10:30.287 --> 10:32.950
he should've been able to give
you whatever Intel he acquired

10:32.951 --> 10:34.155
as a VFF insider.

10:34.156 --> 10:37.393
Conroy says that in the event of a raid,

10:37.394 --> 10:40.863
the leaders had prearranged
travel to the Pacific Northwest

10:40.864 --> 10:42.432
through a series of safe houses.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.500
Their plan, once they arrived in Oregon,

10:44.501 --> 10:47.437
was to go to ground so Dr.
Zanner could get to work

10:47.438 --> 10:49.038
on the biological weapon.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.239
Oregon.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.575
Well, that narrows it down.

10:52.576 --> 10:56.479
Except we're not convinced
the information is solid.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.181
You think he's lying?

10:58.182 --> 11:01.784
No, but he may have been compromised.

11:01.785 --> 11:03.686
We know the Council

11:03.687 --> 11:05.888
suspected a mole in their ranks.

11:05.889 --> 11:09.459
So we've got an agent who was drugged

11:09.460 --> 11:11.194
and might've blown his cover,

11:11.195 --> 11:13.262
a barely-averted terrorist bombing,

11:13.263 --> 11:15.098
bad Intel and no way of knowing

11:15.099 --> 11:17.533
where these madmen will strike next.

11:17.534 --> 11:19.035
Have I got everything?

11:19.036 --> 11:21.136
Yes, sir.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.342
This morning, DEA agents

11:26.343 --> 11:28.411
seized the most expensive
piece of property

11:28.412 --> 11:32.849
in their history, a
360-foot mega-yacht.

11:32.850 --> 11:34.684
Christened the Frisky Business,

11:34.685 --> 11:37.153
it boasts 23,000 feet of living space,

11:37.154 --> 11:40.056
and is worth an estimated $1 billion.

11:40.057 --> 11:42.091
Hey, Dad, you got to
come check this thing out.

11:42.092 --> 11:43.493
It has a missile-detection system,

11:43.494 --> 11:46.162
two helipads, three swimming pools

11:46.163 --> 11:47.697
and a submarine that doubles

11:47.698 --> 11:49.032
as an escape pod.

11:49.033 --> 11:50.566
I got to figure out how to get one.

11:50.567 --> 11:53.102
Well, I can think of two ways.

11:53.103 --> 11:55.705
Become a Bond villain or
invent a social network.

11:55.706 --> 11:58.673
In the meantime, would
you set the table?

12:00.043 --> 12:02.378
Hi, babe.

12:02.379 --> 12:04.280
What happened? I, I
thought we were gonna,

12:04.281 --> 12:06.783
you know, order in Kung Pao and...

12:06.784 --> 12:09.585
I had all this excess
energy to burn, so I thought

12:09.586 --> 12:10.920
I would hobble around the kitchen.

12:10.921 --> 12:12.889
- I kept telling him to sit down.
- I'm sitting down.

12:12.890 --> 12:14.057
Mom, are you home?

12:14.058 --> 12:15.258
Yes. Down here.

12:15.259 --> 12:16.426
I just got an e-mail

12:16.427 --> 12:17.960
from a girl whose sister dated a guy

12:17.961 --> 12:18.961
whose mom knows a woman

12:18.962 --> 12:20.229
who works in the Rafferty admissions,

12:20.230 --> 12:22.198
and I'm freaking out.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.299
Okay.

12:23.300 --> 12:25.902
She says that Rafferty
just decided to expand

12:25.903 --> 12:27.336
their science and technology program,

12:27.337 --> 12:29.205
which means that the brainiacs

12:29.206 --> 12:31.240
are jumping to the top
of the acceptance list.

12:31.241 --> 12:33.242
What if I get boxed out?

12:33.243 --> 12:34.977
Stupid coding.

12:34.978 --> 12:37.780
I know, right? It's not
like science is the future.

12:37.781 --> 12:39.582
They're still gonna need
clothes in the future.

12:39.583 --> 12:41.984
And I'm sure you still have
a good shot of getting in.

12:41.985 --> 12:44.253
It's, it's... Look.

12:44.254 --> 12:47.824
The good news is that Rafferty
is not the only game in town.

12:47.825 --> 12:51.427
Okay? Hutner has this
amazing mentoring program,

12:51.428 --> 12:53.763
where they pair up students
with working designers.

12:53.764 --> 12:55.698
And Bayard has this
top-notch business program.

12:55.699 --> 12:57.867
You could learn how
to be an omnipreneur.

12:57.868 --> 13:00.903
You guys don't think I'm
gonna get in to Rafferty.

13:00.904 --> 13:03.239
- No, no, of course we do.
- No, no.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.942
That's not... Noodle.

13:05.943 --> 13:08.111
There are things that
can affect your admission

13:08.112 --> 13:11.514
that have nothing to do with
you or how great you are.

13:11.515 --> 13:14.817
Like, I don't know,
how many legacies apply.

13:14.818 --> 13:17.920
Or, or shifts in school policy.

13:17.921 --> 13:22.158
Guys, rolling admissions at
Harvard Law are, like, rolling.

13:22.159 --> 13:23.493
Have you heard?

13:23.494 --> 13:24.560
No, not yet.

13:24.561 --> 13:27.230
But I am on the student forum website,

13:27.231 --> 13:29.198
and people are starting to post.

13:29.199 --> 13:31.567
God, you are so lucky
that Rafferty just, like,

13:31.568 --> 13:33.302
tells everyone all at the same time.

13:33.303 --> 13:34.937
Yeah, lucky me.

13:34.938 --> 13:36.506
I'm not even applying to colleges

13:36.507 --> 13:37.774
unless I know they'll take me.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.309
Underachieve, it's the only way to go.

13:40.310 --> 13:41.778
That's what I should've done.

13:41.779 --> 13:42.779
Geez.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.147
Since it's clear some people think

13:44.148 --> 13:46.082
that I set my sights too high.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.784
- Don't be...
- Noodle, come on.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.238
- No...
- What's with her?

13:49.987 --> 13:51.254
The... Harvard? Is that it?

13:51.255 --> 13:54.490
Nope, nope. Relax,
it's just a news alert.

13:54.491 --> 13:57.026
Two, two rebel groups in Somalia

13:57.027 --> 14:00.029
just started shooting at each other.

14:02.000 --> 14:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:13.809 --> 14:16.116
So you're really
planning to travel alone

14:16.117 --> 14:19.253
into rebel-held land and
negotiate a cease-fire?

14:19.254 --> 14:21.221
Yes, ma'am.

14:21.222 --> 14:23.991
I admire your passion, Anis,

14:23.992 --> 14:27.628
but there is fine line

14:27.629 --> 14:30.063
between badass and crazy pants.

14:30.064 --> 14:32.733
How about you just
give me a couple of days

14:32.734 --> 14:35.803
to work a little diplomatic magic?

14:35.804 --> 14:37.604
I already called the Somali president

14:37.605 --> 14:39.006
and asked him to send troops.

14:39.007 --> 14:40.207
All due respect, ma'am,

14:40.208 --> 14:42.376
you know as well as I
do that won't happen.

14:42.377 --> 14:43.610
They've got no control here.

14:43.611 --> 14:45.112
Maybe the U.N...

14:45.113 --> 14:46.446
My second call.

14:46.447 --> 14:48.816
I spoke to the secretary general

14:48.817 --> 14:52.753
and the African Union, but
they said it's too dangerous.

14:52.754 --> 14:55.489
Which brings me back to you.

14:55.490 --> 14:58.592
If you were still my employee,
I wouldn't let you go.

14:58.593 --> 14:59.893
Respectfully, ma'am,

14:59.894 --> 15:02.095
that's one reason why I left
State to work for an NGO.

15:03.198 --> 15:05.999
I think the rebel
leaders will listen to me.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.101
Global Relief Guild
is well-regarded here.

15:08.102 --> 15:12.172
Yesterday, they pointed an AK-47
at you and stole your grain.

15:12.173 --> 15:13.841
Yes, but they didn't shoot me.

15:13.842 --> 15:15.309
T-That's a show of respect.

15:15.310 --> 15:17.511
Okay.

15:17.512 --> 15:19.780
Not that you need my okay anymore.

15:19.781 --> 15:22.649
Good-bye, Madam Secretary.

15:22.650 --> 15:25.017
Yeah.

15:27.154 --> 15:30.256
Hi. I couldn't sleep.

15:37.798 --> 15:39.700
Ice cream at 5:00 a.m.?

15:39.701 --> 15:41.969
You won't even let me
have Sugar Bomb cereal,

15:41.970 --> 15:43.737
and that has ten essential
vitamins and minerals.

15:43.738 --> 15:46.139
Well, soon, you will be at college.

15:46.140 --> 15:48.108
If you want, you can
eat Sugar Bomb cereal

15:48.109 --> 15:49.476
morning, noon and night.

15:49.477 --> 15:52.279
I'm sorry about last night.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.047
I know you were trying to help.

15:54.048 --> 15:56.516
It's really okay.

15:56.517 --> 15:59.453
I know you're stressed
out, it's a stressful time.

15:59.454 --> 16:02.890
You remember when Stevie was
waiting to hear from Lovell,

16:02.891 --> 16:04.819
and she wanted us all to
start calling her Stephanie...

16:04.820 --> 16:07.694
Okay. Could we please
not talk about Stevie?

16:07.695 --> 16:09.997
Yeah, sure.

16:09.998 --> 16:13.333
It's just, I knew this whole
process would be a nightmare.

16:13.334 --> 16:15.335
I just thought it would be mine.

16:15.336 --> 16:17.738
A nightmare just for me.

16:17.739 --> 16:20.841
Well, and who doesn't want that?

16:20.842 --> 16:24.111
Your Dad and I are very
proud of you, Noodle.

16:24.112 --> 16:26.313
I know.

16:26.314 --> 16:30.417
But Stevie is pretty much
everything you guys love,

16:30.418 --> 16:32.886
wrapped up in one stylish package.

16:32.887 --> 16:38.225
She's smart, she's serious,
cares about the world.

16:38.226 --> 16:41.728
I know you guys work hard to
understand what I care about.

16:41.729 --> 16:43.463
I-It's not work.

16:43.464 --> 16:45.899
Not at all.

16:45.900 --> 16:49.169
Ali, you open doors for us.

16:49.170 --> 16:52.372
Show us things that we
might otherwise miss,

16:52.373 --> 16:56.310
like, I don't know, color and beauty

16:56.311 --> 17:01.581
and how people express
themselves differently.

17:01.582 --> 17:06.787
You're an artist, and we are
proud to have one in the family.

17:09.455 --> 17:11.223
Your Dad and I,

17:11.224 --> 17:14.461
we love our kids more
than you can imagine.

17:14.462 --> 17:16.363
Mostly 'cause you're ours.

17:16.364 --> 17:19.132
But we also love your differences.

17:19.133 --> 17:20.434
Even Jason?

17:20.435 --> 17:21.501
Even Jason.

17:22.869 --> 17:25.539
Your assistant said
you had news on the VFF.

17:25.540 --> 17:27.708
We hope to make arrests this week.

17:27.709 --> 17:29.076
That was fast.

17:29.077 --> 17:30.377
An anonymous tip

17:30.378 --> 17:33.146
about several shipments of
hospital-grade medical equipment

17:33.147 --> 17:36.450
led to an abandoned blood work
lab near Baker City, Oregon.

17:36.451 --> 17:38.518
And you think that's where
Dr. Zanner's planning to finish

17:38.519 --> 17:39.820
their biological weapon.

17:39.821 --> 17:41.655
Another tipster claimed he saw

17:41.656 --> 17:45.492
three VFF guys at a gas
station off Interstate 84.

17:45.493 --> 17:46.960
We're waiting for video confirmation,

17:46.961 --> 17:50.297
but the Portland field office
is preparing to raid the lab.

17:50.298 --> 17:52.232
Well, I'm glad I was wrong.

17:52.233 --> 17:54.346
I'll start working
up the interrogations.

17:55.058 --> 17:56.535
Thing is, Henry...

17:58.238 --> 18:00.307
we're taking you off the case.

18:00.308 --> 18:02.843
We brought you on to
be Ian Conroy's handler

18:02.844 --> 18:04.611
while he was inside the militia.

18:04.612 --> 18:06.747
That element of the mission is over,

18:06.748 --> 18:09.339
and to be honest, Director
Doherty isn't happy

18:09.340 --> 18:10.607
with how it all went down.

18:10.608 --> 18:13.844
He made that very clear yesterday.

18:13.845 --> 18:15.112
But I still think my knowledge

18:15.113 --> 18:16.547
as a religious scholar could be helpful.

18:16.548 --> 18:19.116
The mission is now
strictly search and capture.

18:19.117 --> 18:21.617
No religion required.

18:22.686 --> 18:24.354
No religion required?

18:24.355 --> 18:26.790
She actually said that?

18:26.791 --> 18:27.858
Yep.

18:27.859 --> 18:30.327
Well, you took a bullet for this case.

18:30.328 --> 18:31.562
Literally.

18:31.563 --> 18:33.297
I mean, I like Marguerite,

18:33.298 --> 18:34.631
but geez, she can be harsh.

18:34.632 --> 18:38.502
Anyway, I'm handling my
concern very constructively.

18:38.503 --> 18:40.637
I ordered Chinese for dinner.

18:40.638 --> 18:42.739
Well played,
Professor. I will be home

18:42.740 --> 18:44.708
in a moment.

18:44.709 --> 18:46.343
Or not.

18:46.344 --> 18:47.744
Don't hold the Kung Pao.

18:47.745 --> 18:48.978
I'll call you later.

18:49.561 --> 18:51.167
What is it?

18:51.256 --> 18:55.413
Anis Musse. He went into rebel
territory to negotiate a truce.

18:55.414 --> 18:58.149
God. Is he dead?

18:58.150 --> 19:00.637
No, no. He's, he's alive,
and as far as we know,

19:00.638 --> 19:01.871
he's not hurt.

19:01.872 --> 19:04.541
Nadine, you got to lead with that.

19:04.542 --> 19:07.076
Sorry, ma'am. Anis
had secured an agreement

19:07.077 --> 19:09.345
with the leader of the
Revolutionary Army of Somalia.

19:09.346 --> 19:10.680
But then at his second meeting,

19:10.681 --> 19:12.248
the Somali Independence
Front grabbed him up.

19:12.249 --> 19:14.751
They say the Revolutionary Army hijacked

19:14.752 --> 19:16.719
the grain yesterday, so
they want the next shipment.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.988
Obviously, we can't pay a ransom.

19:18.989 --> 19:20.456
And we can't go in and get Anis either.

19:20.457 --> 19:22.525
DOD won't authorize a
rescue while the rebels

19:22.526 --> 19:24.027
are in an active shooting war.

19:24.028 --> 19:27.263
Now we need someone to
negotiate a cease-fire

19:27.264 --> 19:30.133
and pull Anis out of there.

19:30.134 --> 19:32.035
And the rebels won't listen to anyone.

19:32.036 --> 19:34.169
They only hear the voice of guns.

19:38.508 --> 19:42.544
Then... maybe we need someone
who speaks their language.

19:48.384 --> 19:50.119
Dito Pirosmani.

19:50.120 --> 19:51.387
The gunrunner?

19:51.388 --> 19:53.089
What are you, crazy? Ma'am.

19:53.090 --> 19:56.192
Dito Pirosmani sells
the rebels their weapons.

19:56.193 --> 19:57.260
They need him.

19:57.261 --> 19:59.696
Which means that he
holds sway over them.

19:59.697 --> 20:00.997
All due respect, this may be

20:00.998 --> 20:02.432
the most cynical play I've ever heard.

20:02.433 --> 20:05.400
Well, I will take cynical
over mass starvation.

20:06.803 --> 20:10.440
Plus, it is the only way I
can think of to save Anis.

20:10.441 --> 20:13.876
Okay, but why would Pirosmani
ever agree to help us?

20:13.877 --> 20:17.413
A cease-fire works
against his self-interests.

20:17.414 --> 20:20.183
We need to get him to
see the big picture.

20:20.184 --> 20:24.087
Pirosmani makes a huge effort

20:24.088 --> 20:25.588
to stay out of our crosshairs.

20:25.589 --> 20:26.823
Who knows?

20:26.824 --> 20:30.727
He might welcome the opportunity
to have us in his debt.

20:30.728 --> 20:33.863
And, as my mother always said,

20:33.864 --> 20:37.834
no harm in asking.

20:37.835 --> 20:40.737
Let's reach out to any foreign officials

20:40.738 --> 20:43.506
who might have a way to contact him.

20:43.507 --> 20:45.107
We're doing this.

20:52.837 --> 20:55.405
Mr. Brennan, hi. Thanks for coming in.

20:55.406 --> 20:57.674
It's a pleasure to finally
meet you, Madam Secretary.

20:57.675 --> 20:59.409
Last time you contracted with Vesuvian,

20:59.410 --> 21:01.845
you dealt with my former
partner, Isaac Bishop.

21:01.846 --> 21:03.613
Yes, I heard he retired

21:03.614 --> 21:04.715
and you bought him out.

21:04.716 --> 21:06.550
Yes, he asked that I
tell you he continues

21:06.551 --> 21:08.255
to lead humanity astray from the comfort

21:08.256 --> 21:10.520
of his dark underworld lair.

21:10.521 --> 21:12.456
Come on in.

21:12.457 --> 21:14.324
Do you want some coffee?

21:14.325 --> 21:16.694
Blake took excellent care
of me. I'm good, thanks.

21:16.695 --> 21:17.427
Okay.

21:17.428 --> 21:20.130
What can Vesuvian
Security do for you, ma'am?

21:20.131 --> 21:24.434
Well, an American NGO worker

21:24.435 --> 21:28.872
has been taken hostage
in Southern Somalia.

21:28.873 --> 21:29.940
I heard about it.

21:29.941 --> 21:31.208
And I feel for the guy,

21:31.209 --> 21:34.211
but that situation is
too unstable right now.

21:34.212 --> 21:36.747
I'm not gonna send my men
into a de facto war zone.

21:36.748 --> 21:39.115
I'm not asking you to.

21:40.650 --> 21:44.354
We're going to try and
negotiate a cease-fire.

21:44.355 --> 21:47.257
Assuming we do, I'd like
for you to send in a team

21:47.258 --> 21:48.425
to act as security

21:48.426 --> 21:50.560
for Global Relief
Guild when they send in

21:50.561 --> 21:52.229
their next shipment of aid.

21:52.230 --> 21:54.965
On the way out,

21:54.966 --> 21:56.867
you guys will pick up the hostage.

21:56.868 --> 21:58.535
Okay.

21:58.536 --> 22:00.837
But how exactly do you plan
on getting that cease-fire?

22:00.838 --> 22:01.972
You had your staff

22:01.973 --> 22:04.508
reach out to a known arms dealer?

22:04.509 --> 22:05.809
Unofficially.

22:05.810 --> 22:07.277
And they asked him to negotiate

22:07.278 --> 22:10.247
with Somali rebels on
behalf of the United States?

22:10.248 --> 22:12.416
To help bring an end to the conflict,

22:12.417 --> 22:14.618
feed 50,000 starving people

22:14.619 --> 22:17.320
and rescue Anis Musse? Yes, I did.

22:17.321 --> 22:20.724
Pirosmani is a dangerous,
unstable individual.

22:20.725 --> 22:22.826
He's also afraid of the U.S.,

22:22.827 --> 22:25.495
and we can use that to our advantage.

22:27.565 --> 22:28.665
What's your plan, Bess?

22:28.666 --> 22:30.200
According to our contacts,

22:30.201 --> 22:32.402
Pirosmani believes that
the CIA has launched

22:32.403 --> 22:35.705
multiple sting operations in
an effort to take him down.

22:35.706 --> 22:40.644
He is asking for a handshake
agreement in person,

22:40.645 --> 22:44.247
that if he continues to steer
clear of American interests,

22:44.248 --> 22:46.883
we'll steer clear of
him, legally speaking.

22:46.884 --> 22:48.685
CIA doesn't have any operations

22:48.686 --> 22:50.787
targeting Pirosmani.

22:50.788 --> 22:52.222
And no plans to launch one.

22:52.223 --> 22:53.856
Yes.

22:55.559 --> 22:57.227
But he doesn't know that.

22:57.228 --> 23:02.165
Also, during this meeting, I
may be able to get some Intel

23:02.166 --> 23:03.934
on our Texas depot
suspect Anton Jankovic.

23:03.935 --> 23:05.368
Apparently, these arms dealers,

23:05.369 --> 23:07.104
they-they keep tabs on each other.

23:07.105 --> 23:10.974
So, potentially, Pirosmani
can help us recover

23:10.975 --> 23:12.542
some of that stolen weaponry.

23:12.543 --> 23:15.412
Or, potentially, this
blows up into a scandal

23:15.413 --> 23:17.546
worse than arms for hostages.

23:19.316 --> 23:21.116
What's our alternative?

23:22.419 --> 23:25.588
Abandon Anis Musse and allow
the people of Saakow to die?

23:29.259 --> 23:30.793
Take the meeting, Bess.

23:31.528 --> 23:32.861
Thank you.

23:40.137 --> 23:41.538
Madam Secretary.

23:41.539 --> 23:43.872
Hi.

23:44.541 --> 23:46.710
You come long way to meet Dito.

23:46.711 --> 23:49.179
Yes, indeed I did, Mr. Pirosmani.

23:49.180 --> 23:52.649
Because I think that together
we can save thousands of lives.

23:52.650 --> 23:55.886
Yes, how you say,
we make good team?

23:57.054 --> 23:59.055
Well, I-I sure hope so.

23:59.056 --> 24:01.491
It's a shame you cannot stay longer time

24:01.492 --> 24:04.528
in Africa; It's a beautiful place.

24:04.529 --> 24:06.530
Happy people.

24:06.531 --> 24:08.798
When not starving and
killing each other.

24:12.569 --> 24:17.474
So, um... how Dito
can help United States?

24:17.475 --> 24:19.242
Seven minutes, everyone.

24:19.243 --> 24:21.219
You guys are already here.

24:21.220 --> 24:22.979
- Yeah.
- Ready and waiting.

24:22.980 --> 24:24.915
Bring it, Rafferty.

24:24.916 --> 24:26.282
Has Mom called yet?

24:27.017 --> 24:28.552
She will, don't worry.

24:28.553 --> 24:29.786
What if she forgets?

24:29.787 --> 24:32.022
Or she forgets about the
time difference or something?

24:32.023 --> 24:34.991
Sorry, I ju... I'm just feeling

24:34.992 --> 24:37.260
sympathetic anxiety for Ali.

24:37.261 --> 24:39.095
- Anything from Harvard?
- Nope.

24:39.096 --> 24:41.164
Well, listen, Mom is not gonna forget.

24:41.165 --> 24:43.286
This e-mail from Rafferty
is the most important thing

24:43.287 --> 24:44.452
on her mind right now, trust me.

24:44.453 --> 24:47.637
I sincerely doubt that, but okay.

24:47.638 --> 24:50.706
I actually made sure she won't flake.

24:52.242 --> 24:53.643
How'd you do that?

24:53.644 --> 24:58.215
So in exchange for your help,
the CIA would immediately shelve

24:58.216 --> 25:00.717
its undercover investigation
into your business dealings.

25:00.718 --> 25:03.186
Jay, what was it called?

25:03.187 --> 25:05.321
Operation Top Gun.

25:08.225 --> 25:10.126
I am willing to speak with friends

25:10.127 --> 25:13.196
in the Somali Independence Front

25:13.197 --> 25:16.099
and the Revolutionary Army of Somalia,

25:16.100 --> 25:20.937
make them to stop fighting and
release the American aid person.

25:20.938 --> 25:22.072
Excellent.

25:22.073 --> 25:25.108
It's, all well and good,

25:25.109 --> 25:27.811
but...

25:27.812 --> 25:30.714
how you say...

25:30.715 --> 25:35.619
hypothetically, it'll cause
loss to business for me.

25:35.620 --> 25:37.821
Just a temporary cease-fire.

25:37.822 --> 25:39.356
They'll be buying your illegal weapons

25:39.357 --> 25:41.258
again in a few days.

25:41.259 --> 25:43.092
Hypothetically.

25:43.827 --> 25:45.795
I am a legitimate businessman

25:45.796 --> 25:49.165
with interests all over world.

25:49.166 --> 25:50.267
I must have compensation.

25:50.268 --> 25:51.935
Yes, but as I already explained,

25:51.936 --> 25:53.703
I can't pay you cash.

25:53.704 --> 25:55.372
It...

25:55.373 --> 25:57.106
could be considered illegal.

25:58.742 --> 26:02.012
That is the second time you
use this word, "illegal."

26:02.013 --> 26:04.413
I think we're done here.

26:05.749 --> 26:09.351
Better luck next time catching Dito.

26:11.254 --> 26:14.224
You know, Mr. Pirosmani,
back in the States,

26:14.225 --> 26:16.893
we have a word for what you are,

26:16.894 --> 26:18.961
and it isn't "businessman."

26:22.198 --> 26:23.800
It's "omnipreneur."

26:23.801 --> 26:26.503
It's like entrepreneur,

26:26.504 --> 26:28.805
only global.

26:28.806 --> 26:32.042
You go where the action is.

26:33.811 --> 26:35.845
Yeah, I like it, it's
a good name for me.

26:35.846 --> 26:36.946
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:36.947 --> 26:38.414
We're all friends here.

26:40.016 --> 26:42.217
What is it you're looking for?

26:43.186 --> 26:44.454
Here is my proposal.

26:44.455 --> 26:46.589
Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom.

26:46.590 --> 26:48.474
Ooh.

26:48.475 --> 26:50.193
Ma'am, I think it's time
for that conference call

26:50.194 --> 26:51.161
to the States.

26:51.162 --> 26:53.863
- Mom. Mom. Mom. Mom. Mommy.
- Um...

26:53.864 --> 26:55.432
- Mommy. Mom. Mom.
- I actually... this is very...

26:55.433 --> 26:57.100
- Mother. Mom.
- Five minutes.

26:57.101 --> 26:59.099
- Mommy. Mother. Mother.
- It's a conference, five minutes.

26:59.100 --> 27:01.471
- Thank you.
- Busy Madam is... multitasking.

27:01.472 --> 27:02.472
Mother. Mom...

27:02.473 --> 27:04.339
I already had a fail-safe

27:04.340 --> 27:05.966
reminder system in place.

27:05.967 --> 27:07.163
Blake was all over it.

27:07.164 --> 27:08.645
I just wanted to be absolutely sure

27:08.646 --> 27:10.647
you were here.

27:10.648 --> 27:11.614
Okay, here we go.

27:11.615 --> 27:12.615
Is that it?

27:12.616 --> 27:13.683
Ready?

27:13.684 --> 27:15.585
Five,

27:15.586 --> 27:18.521
four, three, two,

27:18.522 --> 27:21.424
one.

27:21.425 --> 27:22.791
I got the e-mail.

27:26.229 --> 27:27.297
"Dear Ms. McCord,

27:27.298 --> 27:28.832
it is our pleasure to inform you..."

27:28.833 --> 27:29.899
Yes!

27:30.901 --> 27:32.702
My God!

27:32.703 --> 27:35.038
Noodle! I'm so proud of you. Yes!

27:35.039 --> 27:36.973
Well, clearly I wasted my time

27:36.974 --> 27:38.541
researching those other schools.

27:38.542 --> 27:41.010
Rafferty knows a fashion
star when they see one.

27:41.011 --> 27:42.345
I'm so proud of you.

27:42.346 --> 27:43.813
I am so sorry about that.

27:43.814 --> 27:46.116
- Thank you.
- That's all right.

27:46.117 --> 27:48.251
You were saying you
had a proposal for me.

27:48.252 --> 27:51.086
Call it a gesture of good faith.

27:54.224 --> 27:57.594
A 360-foot mega-yacht.

27:57.595 --> 28:00.530
Christened the Frisky
Business, it boasts...

28:00.531 --> 28:02.198
It's the most bang for a buck.

28:02.199 --> 28:05.769
Two helipads, three swimming pools.

28:05.770 --> 28:09.239
And a submarine that
doubles as an escape pod.

28:09.240 --> 28:10.606
I know.

28:12.542 --> 28:16.279
So in exchange for
helping us, you want...?

28:16.280 --> 28:18.715
The Frisky Business.

28:27.698 --> 28:31.187
Tac team raided the lab
in Oregon three hours ago.

28:33.918 --> 28:34.886
Bad news?

28:34.887 --> 28:36.287
The place was empty.

28:36.288 --> 28:38.823
We spoke to the medical supply company

28:38.824 --> 28:41.025
that was contracted to
deliver the equipment.

28:41.026 --> 28:44.662
They said no one was ever
there to take possession.

28:44.663 --> 28:46.063
Everything was ordered online,

28:46.064 --> 28:49.367
and the credit card
that was used? Stolen.

28:49.368 --> 28:51.269
Tech is going through it right now,

28:51.270 --> 28:52.870
but this looks like a dead end.

28:52.871 --> 28:55.506
So all of it was just a ruse
to throw us off the scent.

28:55.507 --> 28:58.810
The question is, where are
they really headed, Henry?

28:58.811 --> 29:01.512
If you want to track the
VFF, you've got to remember

29:01.513 --> 29:03.214
what they ultimately want.

29:03.215 --> 29:05.548
To bring about the end times.

29:07.952 --> 29:09.086
I can use your perspective.

29:09.087 --> 29:10.888
Mo, I'm off the case.

29:10.889 --> 29:13.591
And you're probably breaking federal law

29:13.592 --> 29:15.059
by just talking to me about this.

29:15.060 --> 29:17.894
Then I might as well
get something out of it.

29:20.364 --> 29:22.800
I knew as leader of the free world

29:22.801 --> 29:24.302
I would make some tough decisions,

29:24.303 --> 29:26.070
but whether to give
a billion-dollar yacht

29:26.071 --> 29:28.206
to an arms dealer,

29:28.207 --> 29:30.474
that I did not see coming.

29:30.475 --> 29:33.209
If it helps, I also got this.

29:34.979 --> 29:36.514
A phone number.

29:36.515 --> 29:38.482
According to Pirosmani,

29:38.483 --> 29:42.486
that is the personal cell...

29:42.487 --> 29:44.822
of our depot suspect, Anton Jankovic.

29:44.823 --> 29:47.024
So Pirosmani gets a yacht,

29:47.025 --> 29:49.160
and eliminates his biggest competitor.

29:49.161 --> 29:52.429
Win-win for the bad guy.

29:53.197 --> 29:54.799
I know, I know.

29:54.800 --> 29:58.035
50,000 Somalis and
one do-gooder American.

29:58.036 --> 30:00.438
Yes.

30:00.439 --> 30:02.808
Pirosmani's ready to fly to
Somalia and begin the talks.

30:03.154 --> 30:07.378
Anis Musse is released alive
and unhurt, or there's no deal.

30:07.379 --> 30:08.745
Yes, sir.

30:10.014 --> 30:12.450
Elizabeth, hang on.

30:12.451 --> 30:14.118
No, Russell, you
heard the president.

30:14.119 --> 30:15.152
Let it go.

30:15.153 --> 30:16.520
Hey, I already have.

30:16.521 --> 30:18.756
Faustian bargains always
take me an extra minute.

30:18.757 --> 30:20.191
No, no, no, I'm all in.

30:20.192 --> 30:22.894
I just want you to know, I
am gonna take care of this

30:22.895 --> 30:24.295
Harvard Law business.

30:24.296 --> 30:27.031
'Cause this will not stand.

30:27.032 --> 30:28.966
Not while I have breath in my body,

30:28.967 --> 30:32.570
and the private phone numbers
of 40 Harvard Law mega-donors

30:32.571 --> 30:34.138
in my contacts.

30:34.139 --> 30:37.174
Five years ago, I got a dictator's kid

30:37.175 --> 30:39.076
with a 2.5 GPA into that school,

30:39.077 --> 30:41.779
so believe me, I will get
your far more capable daughter

30:41.780 --> 30:45.650
- in as well.
- Stevie heard from Harvard Law?

30:48.086 --> 30:50.754
Hey, you're home. I
was just gonna call you.

30:55.526 --> 30:56.594
What was that for?

30:56.595 --> 30:58.930
Making me hear it from Russell Jackson.

30:58.931 --> 31:00.164
Hear what?

31:00.165 --> 31:01.832
Don't even.

31:01.833 --> 31:04.602
Don't-Don't give me this you
wanted to wait until I got home,

31:04.603 --> 31:07.138
because I've been on a plane
for about 18 hours straight,

31:07.139 --> 31:10.541
rushing home so Senator
Asshat can go on some

31:10.542 --> 31:12.604
fact-finding mission
tomorrow to Cabo San Lucas

31:12.605 --> 31:14.879
with his golfing buddies, and...

31:14.880 --> 31:16.480
- What?
- How could you not tell me?

31:16.481 --> 31:17.682
I don't get it.

31:17.683 --> 31:19.250
Why wouldn't she just tell us?

31:19.251 --> 31:21.118
Well...

31:21.119 --> 31:25.089
maybe she thinks we can't handle it.

31:25.090 --> 31:27.925
Like we would judge

31:27.926 --> 31:31.495
or be disappointed.

31:31.496 --> 31:33.197
I don't know. I mean,

31:33.198 --> 31:36.867
maybe we put too much pressure on her.

31:36.868 --> 31:39.904
- Do we do that?
- No, we don't do that.

31:39.905 --> 31:42.306
Maybe we do do that,

31:42.307 --> 31:45.443
but we don't realize we do that.

31:45.444 --> 31:49.480
God, Henry...

31:49.481 --> 31:52.450
we could be "those" parents.

31:52.451 --> 31:53.985
Think that they're really great

31:53.986 --> 31:55.119
and with it.

31:55.120 --> 31:56.921
- "With it"?
- Really,

31:56.922 --> 31:58.289
their kids hate them.

31:58.290 --> 32:00.992
Look, before we throw out
a solid parenting style

32:00.993 --> 32:03.260
that's worked pretty well
for more than two decades,

32:03.261 --> 32:05.730
let's deal with the problem at hand.

32:05.731 --> 32:07.312
There's only one thing we can do.

32:07.313 --> 32:08.232
Right.

32:08.233 --> 32:09.734
- Talk to her.
- Nothing.

32:09.735 --> 32:11.769
The key to our solid parenting style

32:11.770 --> 32:13.670
is that we're always on the same page.

32:15.306 --> 32:16.574
Usually always.

32:16.575 --> 32:18.442
Look, we...

32:18.443 --> 32:21.379
we need to let Stevie come to us,

32:21.380 --> 32:25.750
and then we need to be
as supportive as possible.

32:25.751 --> 32:27.118
No...

32:27.119 --> 32:28.986
- Pressure.
- No judgment.

32:28.987 --> 32:31.589
No advice.

32:31.590 --> 32:33.491
You've made a list of positive things

32:33.492 --> 32:35.526
to say about her second
choice, didn't you?

32:35.527 --> 32:38.329
Georgetown Law School has
this great feminist program

32:38.330 --> 32:40.231
and semesters abroad.

32:40.232 --> 32:42.433
I'm gonna go shower.

32:42.434 --> 32:43.567
Okay.

32:43.568 --> 32:45.269
It's done.

32:45.270 --> 32:47.468
Dito Pirosmani worked
out a cease-fire agreement

32:47.469 --> 32:49.440
with the rebel groups and the
food is on its way to Saakow.

32:49.441 --> 32:51.442
- What about Anis?
- About to be released.

32:51.443 --> 32:53.577
I guess Pirosmani
really wanted that boat.

32:53.578 --> 32:55.813
- Is Brennan here?
- In the SVTC room.

32:55.814 --> 32:58.182
He has a unit headed out to
the Somali Independence camp

32:58.183 --> 32:59.550
to pick up Anis.

32:59.551 --> 33:03.086
We've arrived at objective.

33:05.723 --> 33:07.458
Madam Secretary, they just pulled up.

33:07.459 --> 33:08.926
Ready Tomcat One.

33:08.927 --> 33:10.161
We're approaching the target.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.395
No rebels in sight.

33:11.396 --> 33:12.430
Let's go.

33:15.666 --> 33:17.667
No sudden moves, fellas.

33:19.637 --> 33:21.638
Movement.

33:22.573 --> 33:24.442
That's him. That's Anis.

33:24.443 --> 33:26.310
We have confirmation on target. Over.

33:26.311 --> 33:28.646
Mr. Musse, approach slowly.

33:28.647 --> 33:30.781
God.

33:30.782 --> 33:31.803
Contact, contact!

33:31.804 --> 33:34.085
Return fire. Return fire. Go, go, go!

33:34.086 --> 33:35.553
What the hell? Why are they shooting?

33:35.554 --> 33:37.988
Snipers must have gotten spooked.

33:45.329 --> 33:48.264
Leader One, I need a sitrep.
Come in, Leader One. Over.

33:52.402 --> 33:56.658
Do we have eyes on Anis?

33:56.659 --> 33:58.360
Leader One, can you
see the target? Over.

33:58.361 --> 34:00.562
Negative on the target.

34:00.563 --> 34:02.898
Run for cover.

34:02.899 --> 34:05.867
I know I said this
would be a non-combatant

34:05.868 --> 34:09.737
evac operation, but we can't leave him.

34:12.341 --> 34:14.342
Leader One, take the house. Over.

34:14.344 --> 34:17.878
Roger that. Blue team, move in.

34:20.181 --> 34:21.248
Where's Anis?

34:21.250 --> 34:22.650
Grab the package and get out.

34:29.491 --> 34:30.908
We've secured the package.

34:30.909 --> 34:32.159
Thank God.

34:32.161 --> 34:33.603
He's wounded but okay.

34:33.603 --> 34:35.263
Can you walk, sir?

34:35.264 --> 34:38.199
Yeah, I think so.

34:38.201 --> 34:40.202
Clear. All clear!

34:40.203 --> 34:42.170
Can your team administer first aid?

34:42.170 --> 34:43.739
Of course. Then they'll chopper him

34:43.739 --> 34:45.540
to Aga Khan hospital, in Mombasa.

34:45.541 --> 34:48.944
Good. And have your men
confiscate the rebel weapons.

34:48.945 --> 34:51.478
I'll need a breakdown.

34:53.614 --> 34:55.583
We're sure this is the last of it?

34:55.585 --> 34:58.720
That stack was processed this morning.

34:58.721 --> 35:01.523
This is everything pulled
from VFF's compound.

35:01.524 --> 35:04.793
Okay. Okay...

35:04.794 --> 35:07.996
What if they aren't planning
an attack in the U.S. at all?

35:07.997 --> 35:09.131
I mean, that would be good, right?

35:09.132 --> 35:11.533
Not necessarily.

35:11.534 --> 35:12.934
I was convinced the higher-ups

35:12.935 --> 35:14.970
at FBI had tunnel vision
when it came to VFF,

35:14.971 --> 35:17.305
but what if we do, too?

35:17.306 --> 35:18.540
In this sermon,

35:18.541 --> 35:21.510
Slattery writes about
the journey to Heaven.

35:21.511 --> 35:23.278
I assumed he was
referring to the Rapture,

35:23.279 --> 35:25.280
when the righteous are taken home.

35:25.281 --> 35:28.750
But now I believe he
was referring to Israa,

35:28.751 --> 35:30.452
the Miraculous Night Journey.

35:30.453 --> 35:31.920
Is that a Bible story?

35:31.921 --> 35:33.221
It's from the Qur'an.

35:33.222 --> 35:36.324
Muhammad traveled from Makka
to Jerusalem in the same night,

35:36.325 --> 35:37.893
and then ascended into Heaven.

35:37.894 --> 35:40.095
Specifically, he went
to what is now the site

35:40.096 --> 35:41.000
of the Al-Aqsa Mosque,

35:41.001 --> 35:42.998
so that God could show him His signs.

35:42.999 --> 35:45.534
It's otherwise known
as the Temple Mount.

35:45.535 --> 35:47.035
The holiest place in Judaism.

35:47.036 --> 35:49.237
Today the Old City is
under Israeli control,

35:49.238 --> 35:51.014
but not the mosque.

35:51.015 --> 35:52.874
That's administered by an Islamic group

35:52.875 --> 35:56.778
made up of Jordanians and
Palestinians called the Waqf.

35:56.779 --> 35:59.714
Now, Slattery is following
signs of the end times

35:59.715 --> 36:02.818
in the real world... plague, droughts.

36:02.819 --> 36:05.146
But a key element of the prophecy

36:05.147 --> 36:07.556
is that the Lord's Temple
will be rebuilt on the Mount.

36:07.557 --> 36:09.991
Which is unlikely,
given that the Waqf is

36:09.992 --> 36:10.959
in charge of the mosque.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.361
But if the mosque were destroyed...

36:13.362 --> 36:15.530
We think their plan is to
drop a biological weapon

36:15.531 --> 36:18.500
on the Al-Aqsa Mosque as a false flag.

36:18.501 --> 36:20.635
To Arab countries, it
will seem like Israel

36:20.636 --> 36:22.860
is trying to poison the land so
that they can destroy the mosque

36:22.861 --> 36:24.473
and rebuild the temple.

36:24.474 --> 36:26.441
Neighboring Muslim
countries will then attack.

36:26.442 --> 36:29.945
The U.S. will step
in to defend its ally.

36:29.946 --> 36:31.847
- Russia will go to Iran.
- World War III.

36:31.848 --> 36:33.376
If we're right, they'll make their move

36:33.377 --> 36:35.417
during the annual celebration
of Muhammad's journey,

36:35.418 --> 36:37.486
known as Lailat Al Miraj.

36:37.487 --> 36:38.587
Which is when?

36:38.588 --> 36:40.822
Three weeks.

36:40.823 --> 36:42.672
Slattery's people will be
trying to make their way

36:42.673 --> 36:44.493
out of the U.S. and
into the Middle East.

36:44.494 --> 36:46.161
Small window.

36:46.162 --> 36:48.596
Let's get into it.

36:50.799 --> 36:52.100
Dr. McCord,

36:52.101 --> 36:55.003
we clearly could still
use your expertise.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.005
I'd like to officially reinstate you,

36:57.006 --> 36:58.373
if you're game.

36:58.374 --> 37:00.341
Okay, I'll get to work.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.948
Can I help?

37:06.949 --> 37:08.984
Um, you can get the matches.

37:08.985 --> 37:10.417
They're over there somewhere.

37:13.088 --> 37:14.689
By the way, I have some news.

37:16.025 --> 37:18.793
My God, you already know?

37:18.794 --> 37:20.195
I don't know.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.964
Mom, I don't know how
you made it 20 years

37:22.965 --> 37:24.733
in the CIA with that

37:24.734 --> 37:27.903
- lousy poker face.
- Fine.

37:27.904 --> 37:29.271
Russell told me.

37:31.941 --> 37:33.808
I know you should have heard it from me,

37:33.809 --> 37:35.544
but, um...

37:35.545 --> 37:38.146
I just...

37:38.147 --> 37:40.882
I was gonna tell you after
Ali found out about Rafferty,

37:40.883 --> 37:44.119
but, I mean, she was so happy,

37:44.120 --> 37:47.789
and I really didn't want to
rain on her celebration, so...

37:47.790 --> 37:50.058
Are you okay?

37:50.059 --> 37:52.928
I mean, I'm not happy, but I'm okay.

37:52.929 --> 37:55.363
'Cause Russell's ready
to storm the castle

37:55.364 --> 37:57.699
to get you off the wait list.

37:57.700 --> 37:59.668
I already told him that I'm going to

37:59.669 --> 38:01.136
write a letter to the admissions board,

38:01.137 --> 38:02.437
you know, pleading my own case.

38:02.438 --> 38:04.350
I feel like it's the
least that they can expect

38:04.351 --> 38:05.383
from a future graduate.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.641
Mom...

38:06.642 --> 38:08.442
I am so proud of you.

38:11.112 --> 38:12.647
So we're doing candles on this,

38:12.648 --> 38:14.182
- "got into college" cake?
- Yeah.

38:14.183 --> 38:15.750
We're all just kind of winging it, babe.

38:15.751 --> 38:16.685
Okay.

38:16.686 --> 38:19.254
- Let's do this.
- Let's do it.

38:34.704 --> 38:37.204
Thank you guys.

38:40.175 --> 38:43.044
Whoo!

38:43.045 --> 38:45.080
Um, I have an announcement.

38:45.081 --> 38:46.214
Rafferty changed their mind?

38:46.215 --> 38:48.116
- No, I did.
- What?

38:48.117 --> 38:49.423
I'm not going to Rafferty.

38:49.424 --> 38:50.952
- What do you mean?
- What? Why?

38:50.953 --> 38:52.887
I spent some time on the message boards,

38:52.888 --> 38:56.024
and I realized that a lot of these kids

38:56.025 --> 38:58.126
sounded super obnoxious

38:58.127 --> 39:01.229
and superficial and braggy.

39:01.230 --> 39:02.564
Sounds like you found your people.

39:02.565 --> 39:03.932
Go get plates.

39:03.933 --> 39:09.204
And with that, I was so determined

39:09.205 --> 39:11.106
to get into Rafferty,

39:11.107 --> 39:13.108
I kind of ignored all the stuff

39:13.109 --> 39:14.476
that bothered me about it.

39:14.477 --> 39:15.877
Like the fact that they don't

39:15.878 --> 39:18.446
focus enough on the business
aspect of the industry.

39:18.447 --> 39:22.917
So I've decided to go to Bayard's.

39:22.918 --> 39:24.152
Omnipreneur program.

39:24.153 --> 39:25.186
- Wow.
- Wow!

39:25.187 --> 39:27.589
It combines my love for fashion

39:27.590 --> 39:29.891
with concrete business skills.

39:29.892 --> 39:31.493
That's awesome, Ali.

39:31.494 --> 39:32.961
And it's in D.C.

39:32.962 --> 39:34.362
Which is the down side.

39:34.363 --> 39:36.031
Not for me!

39:36.032 --> 39:37.932
Okay, hey, here's to
your new first choice.

39:37.933 --> 39:40.602
Yes. Congrats.

39:40.603 --> 39:42.537
Looking good, badass.

39:42.538 --> 39:44.506
I'm feeling good, Madam Secretary.

39:44.507 --> 39:47.175
And I hear the food aid has
been distributed in Saakow.

39:47.176 --> 39:50.078
Not only that, the
cease-fire is holding,

39:50.079 --> 39:51.479
and an African Union

39:51.480 --> 39:53.148
mediation team is on their way.

39:53.149 --> 39:54.916
Well, fingers crossed
we get a heavy rainfall

39:54.917 --> 39:57.152
when the Dayr comes,
or you and I could be

39:57.153 --> 39:58.386
right back in the same boat.

39:58.387 --> 40:01.756
One crisis at a time. That's my motto.

40:03.059 --> 40:04.726
Thanks for saving my ass.

40:04.727 --> 40:06.461
Ma'am.

40:06.462 --> 40:08.596
I'll talk to you soon.

40:08.597 --> 40:10.765
Ma'am, Daryl Brennan
sent this over for you.

40:10.766 --> 40:13.300
Thanks, Blake.

40:22.377 --> 40:25.814
During the rescue, when
the rebels were firing

40:25.815 --> 40:27.348
on the Vesuvian team,

40:27.349 --> 40:29.284
it took me back to my CIA training.

40:29.285 --> 40:31.553
I can still hear the difference.

40:31.554 --> 40:33.788
On full auto, the Kalashnikov

40:33.789 --> 40:36.157
cycles more slowly than the M16.

40:36.158 --> 40:38.426
The photos just confirm my theory.

40:38.427 --> 40:40.495
We thought the rebels had AK-47s,

40:40.496 --> 40:41.796
but some of these are M16s.

40:41.797 --> 40:43.732
Where did they get U.S. weapons?

40:43.733 --> 40:45.767
From the Texas depot.

40:45.768 --> 40:48.403
The serial numbers are filed off,

40:48.404 --> 40:50.138
but they check out.

40:50.139 --> 40:53.274
And we're sure Dito Pirosmani
sold the rebels their guns?

40:53.275 --> 40:54.934
Pirosmani stole American weapons

40:54.935 --> 40:56.878
and sold them on the black market.

40:56.879 --> 40:59.347
He ordered the murders of Agent Garcia

40:59.348 --> 41:00.215
and Barry Milken.

41:00.216 --> 41:02.484
And we let him slip away.

41:02.485 --> 41:05.720
Well, at least we didn't
compound our idiocy

41:05.721 --> 41:07.388
by giving him a billion-dollar boat.

41:07.389 --> 41:12.227
I'd scuttle the Frisky Business
before letting that happen.

41:12.228 --> 41:13.762
Any idea where he is?

41:13.763 --> 41:16.531
CIA says he flew out of Mogadishu

41:16.532 --> 41:17.732
on a private jet

41:17.733 --> 41:19.634
right after the
cease-fire was declared.

41:19.635 --> 41:21.603
They're trying to track him down,

41:21.604 --> 41:24.938
but he's gone.

41:25.598 --> 41:27.008
Thanks for coming in, Henry.

41:27.009 --> 41:29.644
Sure. What's going on?

41:29.645 --> 41:30.990
We tracked Slattery and the others

41:30.991 --> 41:32.580
to the Port of Baltimore.

41:32.581 --> 41:34.115
Two days after the VFF raids,

41:34.116 --> 41:36.184
they booked berths on a
freighter headed for Greece.

41:36.185 --> 41:38.520
Disembarked five days ago.

41:38.521 --> 41:40.288
From there, it would be
easy for them to catch

41:40.289 --> 41:43.091
a smaller ship to Lebanon, Turkey.

41:43.092 --> 41:45.360
Or they could be traveling over land.

41:45.361 --> 41:47.995
They could be anywhere by now.

42:05.747 --> 42:07.180
Gentlemen...

42:08.583 --> 42:10.083
welcome to Syria.

42:10.483 --> 42:15.508
