-(tuts)

00:33.410 --> 00:35.515
Well, as of now,
we are seven weeks out.

00:35.548 --> 00:37.485
Our DBA just got rejected.

00:37.519 --> 00:39.623
Fire suppression
hasn't shown up yet.

00:39.656 --> 00:41.694
We have to schedule
a second deep clean

00:41.727 --> 00:45.100
because our building's
now considered a biohazard

00:45.133 --> 00:47.104
and we only have
a couple walls left standing.

00:47.137 --> 00:48.708
Why-why did we get rejected?

00:48.741 --> 00:50.444
SUGAR: Well, because
we filed for a new name.

00:50.477 --> 00:51.379
Why is that a problem?

00:51.412 --> 00:52.649
Well, because we never

00:52.682 --> 00:54.419
filed for a first name.

00:54.452 --> 00:58.160
We, they, Mikey
weren't operating correctly

00:58.193 --> 01:00.632
because they were
never doing business as.

01:00.665 --> 01:03.705
So now we have to file
to do business as The Bear

01:03.738 --> 01:06.844
and pay a fine for not doing
business as The Beef originally.

01:06.877 --> 01:08.815
Because according to the IRS,
we're assholes.

01:08.848 --> 01:10.484
So it's a money thing?

01:10.518 --> 01:12.723
Yeah, it's all
another money thing, Carm.

01:12.756 --> 01:14.659
Uh, how fast
can we do a deep clean then?

01:14.993 --> 01:17.331

I don't think.

because...

Richie to know.

really great desserts.

16:04.304 --> 16:05.406
LUCA: Correct.

16:08.245 --> 16:09.414
So how long you been a cook?

16:10.383 --> 16:12.186
About a year and a half.
You?

16:13.623 --> 16:16.161
Uh, 14 years now.

16:16.763 --> 16:18.432
Oh, so you started
when you was three?

16:18.465 --> 16:20.169
(chuckles) Uh...

16:21.104 --> 16:22.473
Close enough, yeah.

16:25.514 --> 16:26.716
MARCUS:
Where'd you grow up?

16:26.749 --> 16:28.520
LUCA: Uh, London.

16:28.553 --> 16:29.656
You're from Chicago?

16:29.689 --> 16:31.559
Yeah. Chicago.

16:32.494 --> 16:33.630
Did you go to school for this?

16:33.663 --> 16:35.099
LUCA: I didn't. No.

16:35.132 --> 16:38.072
Uh, I didn't do
too well in school.

16:38.105 --> 16:39.174
Got in quite a bit of trouble.

16:39.207 --> 16:42.213
Ditched the check.
They caught me.

16:42.246 --> 16:45.352
Made me wash dishes,
and, uh, I loved it.

16:47.490 --> 16:48.594
What about you?

16:48.627 --> 16:50.497
MARCUS: Needed a job.

16:50.530 --> 16:52.668
Well, there's
a lot of other jobs.

16:52.701 --> 16:55.406
I worked at the phone company
for, like, five years.

16:55.439 --> 16:57.778
-And then McDonald's.
-LUCA: Out of high school?

16:57.811 --> 17:01.085
I played division three football
in college.

17:01.118 --> 17:03.488
Oh, shit.
What position were you?

17:04.592 --> 17:06.228
Outside linebacker.

17:06.261 --> 17:08.800
Okay. What does
the outside linebacker do?

17:08.833 --> 17:10.770
Cover the end
and protect the pass.

17:12.106 --> 17:13.242
LUCA: And you loved it?

17:13.275 --> 17:14.612
Yeah. I loved it.

17:15.514 --> 17:16.783
And it paid for school,

17:16.816 --> 17:19.755
but nowhere really to go after.

17:20.223 --> 17:22.828
And four years ago,
my mom got sick,

17:22.861 --> 17:24.832
so I was trying
to find a better job.

17:24.865 --> 17:27.705
And I always used to get lunch
at this beef spot,

17:27.738 --> 17:30.176
and the owner was...

17:30.209 --> 17:33.784
He was really tight,
but also really
out of his fuckin' mind.

17:33.817 --> 17:35.854
And he wanted to open a bakery,

17:35.887 --> 17:38.359
so I stopped making Big Macs

17:38.392 --> 17:41.533
and I learned
how to make bread and, yeah.

17:41.566 --> 17:42.634
How's your mom doing?

17:43.202 --> 17:47.845
Well, they say the expectancy
was only a couple of years

17:47.878 --> 17:50.750
and that was
four years ago, so...

17:53.489 --> 17:54.558
I just...

17:55.126 --> 17:57.497
I just try to spend
as much time with her as I can.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.537
You're an only child?

18:00.570 --> 18:02.373
No. A younger brother. You?

18:04.177 --> 18:07.183
Uh, yeah.
I got a younger sister
somewhere, yeah.

18:11.759 --> 18:13.295
How’d you get good at this?

18:14.699 --> 18:17.203
(exhales) Honestly,
I made a lot of mistakes.

18:17.236 --> 18:18.540
(scoffs)

18:18.573 --> 18:21.178
MARCUS:
That's the secret, just fuck up?

18:21.211 --> 18:22.648
It might be,
you know, fuck up.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.453
I think 'cause I started early,

18:25.486 --> 18:27.858
I got my skill set up
really quick

18:27.891 --> 18:31.365
and then started to feel like
I was really the best,

18:31.398 --> 18:33.570
you know, like at
all these really good places.

18:33.603 --> 18:34.739
I really was the best cook.

18:34.772 --> 18:36.843
And then I started

18:36.876 --> 18:38.846
at this really great place
as a commis.

18:40.382 --> 18:43.389
And this other chef
started the same day as me,

18:43.422 --> 18:45.326
and... (sighs)

18:45.359 --> 18:46.863
I thought
we were competition,

18:46.896 --> 18:48.833
um, but really we weren't.

18:49.602 --> 18:52.440
He was better than me.
Much, much better than me.

18:53.075 --> 18:57.617
He worked harder and faster
than I ever could.

18:57.984 --> 19:00.758
And it was the first time
I realized

19:00.791 --> 19:02.861
that I wasn't the best

19:03.530 --> 19:05.767
and I was never
gonna be the best.

19:07.504 --> 19:09.509
So I started looking at it
like it was a good thing.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.513
Like, at least I knew
who the best was now,

19:11.546 --> 19:13.248
and I could take
that pressure off myself.

19:13.883 --> 19:16.488
And the only logical thing to do
was to try and keep up with him.

19:17.057 --> 19:19.595
So I never left this guy's side.

19:20.063 --> 19:21.499
And you got better.

19:21.532 --> 19:24.204
Oh, mate, I got better than

19:24.237 --> 19:25.874
I ever thought
I possibly could be

19:25.907 --> 19:27.611
just from trying
to keep up with him.

19:29.447 --> 19:30.651
You're like Pippen.

19:30.684 --> 19:33.255
-Who's Pippen?
-Scottie Pippen.

19:33.288 --> 19:35.226
He was like that
with Michael Jordan.

19:35.259 --> 19:36.227
Who's Michael Jordan?

19:36.929 --> 19:40.403
Fucker.
I know, I know you know
who Michael Jordan is.

19:40.436 --> 19:42.339
Yeah, no, we've heard
of him in London, yeah.

19:43.241 --> 19:45.547
Yeah, I guess, uh,
I was like Scottie.

19:46.315 --> 19:48.218
But he was a Hall of Famer,
though.

19:48.853 --> 19:50.389
Number 33.

19:50.422 --> 19:51.960
LUCA: Honored.

19:51.993 --> 19:54.665
No, I think at a certain stage
it becomes

19:54.698 --> 19:57.369
less about skill
and it's more about being open.

19:58.005 --> 19:59.509
-Open?
-LUCA: Yeah.

19:59.542 --> 20:03.516
To-to the world, to yourself,
to other people.

20:05.419 --> 20:06.856
You know, most of
the incredible things

20:06.889 --> 20:08.727
that I've eaten haven't been

20:08.760 --> 20:10.964
because the skill level
is exceptionally high

20:10.997 --> 20:14.004
or there's loads
of mad fancy techniques.

20:14.037 --> 20:16.374
It's because it's been
really inspired, you know.

20:17.476 --> 20:18.679
I like that.

20:19.180 --> 20:21.384
You can spend all the time
in the world in here,

20:22.053 --> 20:24.291
but if you don't spend
enough time out there...

20:24.324 --> 20:24.992
Right.

20:25.025 --> 20:26.662
LUCA: You know?

20:28.465 --> 20:30.537

good people around you, too.

20:34.712 --> 20:37.249

Why are you saying his name like
it's Martin Luther King Jr.?

25:30.269 --> 25:32.608
He's like
a college basketball coach.

25:32.641 --> 25:35.146
(chuckling)
Okay. So what'd you learn?

25:35.179 --> 25:37.985
Um, dude,
they had a minute left,

25:38.018 --> 25:39.655
and they kept
their composure.

25:39.688 --> 25:42.728
He made a bunch of decisions.
It was very cool. They won.

25:42.761 --> 25:43.997
Sports.

25:44.030 --> 25:45.065
Kept drillin'.

25:45.098 --> 25:46.936
SYDNEY:
They kept drilling.

25:46.969 --> 25:48.105
Ooh, guess what.

25:48.138 --> 25:50.777
We failed
the fire suppression test.

25:50.810 --> 25:52.614
Yeah. Sorry I'm not
there to help.

25:52.647 --> 25:55.186
No, you do not need
to be here at all.

25:55.219 --> 25:56.956
I'm really happy
that you're over there

25:56.989 --> 25:59.093
and you're, like,
enjoying yourself.

26:00.395 --> 26:03.301
I do feel a little guilty,
though, not being home.

26:04.805 --> 26:06.073
I...

26:07.042 --> 26:09.849
I don't know, I keep
having this nightmare

26:09.882 --> 26:12.186
that Kristy's calling me,

26:12.219 --> 26:14.758
telling me that my mom's dead,

26:14.791 --> 26:18.131
and then I wake up
and everything is fine,

26:18.164 --> 26:19.266
and... I don't know.

26:22.273 --> 26:24.010
Yeah, I-I get that.

26:24.043 --> 26:27.316
But, also, she's okay,
you know, like,

26:27.349 --> 26:30.356
she's with people
who care about her

26:30.389 --> 26:32.126
and are taking care of her.

26:32.159 --> 26:36.936
And you deserve
to be enjoying yourself.

26:36.969 --> 26:39.174
Like, you can't
take care of her

26:39.207 --> 26:40.776
if you're not taking care
of you, you know.

26:41.277 --> 26:42.948
I guess so.

26:42.981 --> 26:44.751
Ugh, I miss you, man.

26:52.399 --> 26:53.669
I miss you, too.

26:56.775 --> 26:58.278
Oh, shit. Hello?

26:58.311 --> 26:59.246
Hello? Hello? Syd?

26:59.280 --> 27:02.186
(screams) Sorry,
I didn't actually freeze.

27:02.219 --> 27:03.923
Oh, you fuckin' play too much.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.025
SYDNEY:
It was a little bit scary.

27:05.058 --> 27:06.394
I saw my face
during that moment.

27:06.427 --> 27:07.698
MARCUS:
Eat your cereal.

27:07.731 --> 27:09.400
Alright, I'm going to sleep.

27:09.433 --> 27:11.638
-I'll talk to you later.
-SYDNEY: Okay. Night, dude.

Harmonia & Eno '76 playing)
