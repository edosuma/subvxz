WEBVTT

00:08.531 --> 00:09.774
Hold on!

00:09.775 --> 00:11.709
You put the peanut
butter and jelly

00:11.710 --> 00:13.374
on separate slices?

00:13.375 --> 00:16.660
That's the way we do it
in Florida.

00:17.470 --> 00:20.634
Man, Florida's
the coolest.

00:20.635 --> 00:22.123
...so I said to him

00:22.124 --> 00:23.878
not if you want to
carry my books again.

00:23.879 --> 00:25.039
No, you did not say that.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.690
Yes, I did, girl.

00:27.453 --> 00:28.839
Okay, what are
you looking at?

00:28.840 --> 00:30.830
Nothing... but now I am.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.305
Hello, Chelsea baby.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.959
Okay, Corey, you're ten;
I'm 15.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.383
Which means
she's old enough

00:37.384 --> 00:39.247
to be grossed
out by you.

00:40.675 --> 00:41.785
And who are you?

00:41.786 --> 00:43.040
Pleased to meet you.

00:43.041 --> 00:44.674
I'm Miles Bonet.

00:44.675 --> 00:47.339
Well, aren't you
the cutest little thing.

00:47.340 --> 00:48.334
I'm Raven.

00:48.335 --> 00:51.239
He just moved here
from Florida.

00:51.240 --> 00:51.941
And if you go back

00:51.942 --> 00:53.472
will you please take
my little brother with you?

00:56.178 --> 00:57.480
Raven, can we go now

00:57.481 --> 00:59.403
'cause Corey's starting to
get those driplets of drool.

00:59.404 --> 01:00.885
It's really gross.

01:03.975 --> 01:06.868
Whoa, they don't make
them like her in Florida.

01:07.252 --> 01:09.076
Hey-- Chelsea's mine.

01:09.077 --> 01:10.611
I'm talking
about Raven.

01:11.039 --> 01:12.639
Eww, my sister?

01:13.007 --> 01:14.426
You can have her.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:03.519 --> 02:04.905
Yep, that's me.

02:12.736 --> 02:15.039
Guess who I just
got off the phone with.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.048
A maid, I hope.

02:16.049 --> 02:17.320
I'm tired.

02:17.321 --> 02:21.575
No, the TV show,
Hello, San Francisco.

02:22.775 --> 02:24.804
You know, they do that segment

02:24.805 --> 02:27.134
on chefs cooking
in their own homes.

02:27.135 --> 02:29.539
Ooh, Dad, no, you are not going
to be on TV.

02:29.540 --> 02:30.999
They're coming here tomorrow.

02:39.605 --> 02:41.468
What are we jumping around for?

02:41.469 --> 02:43.469
Dad's going to be on TV.

02:49.505 --> 02:52.239
Miles, what do you think
you're doing?

02:52.240 --> 02:54.032
I'm just so happy
for your dad.

02:54.033 --> 02:55.247
Go hug him.

02:55.248 --> 02:56.755
Congratulations, sir.

02:56.756 --> 02:58.093
You really deserve this.

02:58.094 --> 02:59.187
Well, thank
you very much.

02:59.188 --> 03:00.749
Coming from you,
that means a lot.

03:01.323 --> 03:02.595
Who are you?

03:02.999 --> 03:04.304
This is Miles.

03:04.305 --> 03:06.518
He's from Florida.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.787
Well, you picked
a very exciting day

03:08.788 --> 03:09.774
to come, Miles.

03:09.775 --> 03:11.469
Honey, this could be
your big break.

03:11.470 --> 03:13.604
You could
become famous.

03:13.605 --> 03:15.504
The pressure
must be enormous.

03:15.505 --> 03:16.854
My dad's not scared.

03:16.855 --> 03:18.326
Well, like, what if
he makes a mistake

03:18.327 --> 03:20.053
in front of
millions of people?

03:20.054 --> 03:21.606
Millions...?

03:21.607 --> 03:22.688
Uh, Corey

03:22.689 --> 03:23.605
why don't you
take Miles

03:23.606 --> 03:25.302
and show him something
that's far away.

03:25.303 --> 03:27.068
Yeah... like Florida.

03:28.935 --> 03:30.491
Dad, don't listen
to that kid, okay?

03:30.492 --> 03:31.774
You're going to do great.

03:31.775 --> 03:33.469
You have been preparing
for this moment

03:33.470 --> 03:34.469
your whole career.

03:34.470 --> 03:35.338
Yeah, I know

03:35.339 --> 03:36.973
but what if I forget
how to do something

03:36.974 --> 03:39.739
like de-bone a chicken
or make a sauce or...

03:41.027 --> 03:42.017
or breathe?

03:42.018 --> 03:44.106
Honey, take it easy.

03:44.107 --> 03:45.553
No, no, no,
I got to cancel.

03:45.554 --> 03:47.259
Dad... wait!

03:53.735 --> 03:55.287
Rae, did you just
have a vision?

03:55.288 --> 03:57.995
Yes, Dad,
and I saw you on the show.

03:57.996 --> 03:59.608
You were chopping up everything

03:59.609 --> 04:01.035
and you were breathing like
you've been doing it

04:01.036 --> 04:02.355
your whole life.

04:02.356 --> 04:03.372
Really?

04:03.935 --> 04:04.874
How'd I look?

04:04.875 --> 04:07.316
Like Denzel with a spatula!

04:07.917 --> 04:10.543
That's what I'm talking about,
yeah!

04:10.544 --> 04:13.111
Okay, then-then everything's
going to be fine.

04:13.112 --> 04:14.837
Oh, thank you, baby.

04:15.147 --> 04:17.209
I gotta go check out
some recipes.

04:17.211 --> 04:18.829
I'm going to be on TV...

04:18.829 --> 04:20.531
like Denzel with a spatula.

04:23.168 --> 04:25.082
Well, that homework's
not going to do itself.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.072
Hold it!

04:26.535 --> 04:28.036
Rae, you made that
whole vision up.

04:28.037 --> 04:29.008
Mama, listen.

04:29.009 --> 04:30.447
This is Dad's big break.

04:30.448 --> 04:32.081
He was about to cancel.

04:32.082 --> 04:34.909
So, you just lied to give
him a little confidence boost?

04:34.910 --> 04:36.529
I was just trying
to help.

04:36.970 --> 04:38.143
Look at him, Mom.

04:38.144 --> 04:39.974
# I'm a cookin' man #

04:39.975 --> 04:43.209
# Oww!
With a big old frying pan #

04:43.210 --> 04:44.300
# Oww! #

04:44.861 --> 04:46.909
So, you still think
I did the wrong thing?

04:46.910 --> 04:50.057
Yes... but for
the right reasons.

04:51.335 --> 04:52.939
Just no more
fake visions.

04:52.940 --> 04:54.135
Okay, I promise.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.204
Rae, this is a disaster.

05:00.205 --> 05:02.364
This show was supposed to be
your father's big break.

05:05.618 --> 05:12.939
Chelsea, what I lack in age,
I make up for in muscle.

05:21.935 --> 05:24.139
How long have you
been standing there?

05:24.140 --> 05:26.034
Long enough, my friend.

05:26.035 --> 05:27.863
You got a better way
of getting girls?

05:27.864 --> 05:29.782
As a matter
of fact, I do.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.393
"Hypnotism...

05:34.335 --> 05:36.580
The Trance
for Romance"?

05:36.581 --> 05:37.782
Watch and learn.

05:37.783 --> 05:42.140
I'm Dr. Wendell Van Leer,
master of hypnosis.

05:42.141 --> 05:45.016
Not everyone can be put
into a hypnotic sleep

05:45.017 --> 05:48.006
but those who can
will be under your power

05:48.007 --> 05:49.961
for up to
24 hours

05:49.962 --> 05:51.541
or your
money back.

05:51.542 --> 05:56.582
Now, take out
your complimentary hypno-stone.

05:58.935 --> 06:01.546
And swing it thusly.

06:05.075 --> 06:06.975
Now you're getting it.

06:15.981 --> 06:17.469
Rae, can you please
calm down, okay?

06:17.470 --> 06:18.888
You're making me
so dizzy.

06:18.889 --> 06:20.623
Listen, I'm
nervous, okay

06:20.624 --> 06:21.686
and I'm worried
about my dad

06:21.687 --> 06:23.324
and I clean
when I'm nervous.

06:23.325 --> 06:26.789
Rae, I think my arm
is piney-fresh now. Thanks.

06:27.887 --> 06:28.853
Hey, guys.

06:28.854 --> 06:30.285
Oh, hey, Mr. Baxter.

06:30.286 --> 06:31.471
Hey, Mr. Baxter

06:31.472 --> 06:33.643
you ready
for your big TV debut?

06:33.644 --> 06:34.605
Yeah, that's right.

06:34.606 --> 06:35.452
You know, I've
been working

06:35.453 --> 06:36.272
on some catch phrases--

06:36.273 --> 06:38.068
something cool to say
when I add an ingredient.

06:38.069 --> 06:39.607
Right on.
Check it out.

06:39.608 --> 06:40.863
Check it out, yeah.

06:40.864 --> 06:41.924
I kinda dig that.

06:41.925 --> 06:43.200
This cat's right.

06:43.201 --> 06:44.666
No, that's... that's not it.

06:44.667 --> 06:45.426
Listen up.

06:45.427 --> 06:46.058
Listen up?

06:46.059 --> 06:48.122
Ooh, you know
it's kind of "old school"

06:48.123 --> 06:49.058
but it's still
really catchy.

06:49.059 --> 06:50.428
I like that.

06:50.429 --> 06:51.903
Listen... okay.

06:52.476 --> 06:55.604
The next word that comes
out of my dad's mouth

06:55.605 --> 06:58.252
will be the catch phrase,
not that lame stuff, okay?

06:58.253 --> 06:59.349
Okay, Dad,
now give it to me.

07:00.010 --> 07:01.474
Kapowie!

07:02.780 --> 07:05.328
Well, that's good.
Yeah!

07:05.329 --> 07:06.327
Thanks, guys.

07:06.328 --> 07:07.735
Kapowie!

07:07.736 --> 07:09.657
Kapowie! Yeah!

07:12.564 --> 07:14.559
You guys, I am
so worried.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.939
Something bad is going
to happen to my dad.

07:16.940 --> 07:19.038
Mm, like saying, "Kapowie"?

07:21.575 --> 07:22.574
Y'all dig this:

07:22.575 --> 07:23.699
I'm going to go
catch the game.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.901
I'm just a phone call away
if you need me...

07:25.902 --> 07:27.380
during half-time.

07:27.381 --> 07:28.609
All right, okay.

07:36.575 --> 07:38.704
Man, what are you two wearing?

07:38.705 --> 07:42.309
My grandpa showed us how
the players dress in Florida.

07:42.310 --> 07:44.804
It looks like your Grandpa
played you.

07:48.535 --> 07:50.234
Hello, baby.

07:50.235 --> 07:54.232
May I say you look
ravishing today.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.997
Can you say it on your
way back to the home?

07:59.405 --> 08:00.440
What is that?

08:00.754 --> 08:02.634
Is... is that mothballs?

08:02.635 --> 08:04.796
It's the state
smell of Florida.

08:05.770 --> 08:07.447
So, what do you think

08:07.448 --> 08:12.189
of our handsome-
new-man jewelry?

08:12.190 --> 08:15.459
Watch as we swing
them thusly.

08:16.107 --> 08:20.872
Back and forth,
back and forth...

08:21.524 --> 08:25.170
Listen to the sound
of our soothing voices.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.728
Your eyes are closing...

08:27.729 --> 08:28.990
closing.

08:28.991 --> 08:30.934
You're falling asleep...

08:30.935 --> 08:34.760
drifting further and further
into unconsciousness.

08:34.761 --> 08:36.239
When you hear the word

08:36.240 --> 08:38.195
"San Francisco"

08:38.196 --> 08:40.254
you will fall
into a deep

08:40.255 --> 08:42.056
deep sleep.

08:42.057 --> 08:43.442
And you won't wake up

08:43.443 --> 08:46.670
until you hear the
word, "Okeechobee."

08:47.928 --> 08:48.974
Okeechobee?

08:48.975 --> 08:50.675
Yeah, that's
where I was born.

08:52.394 --> 08:57.309
Ready, one...
two... three...

08:57.310 --> 08:59.705
San Francisco.

09:03.888 --> 09:05.374
It worked.

09:05.375 --> 09:07.974
Raven, you will fall
in love with Miles.

09:07.975 --> 09:12.074
And Chelsea, you will
fall in love with Corey.

09:12.917 --> 09:16.856
Oh, Miles, you big hunk
of Florida sunshine.

09:16.857 --> 09:22.170
Oh, Corey, you are all man,
and you are all mine.

09:22.470 --> 09:23.534
Kiss me.

09:23.535 --> 09:25.106
Kiss me, Miles.

09:26.094 --> 09:27.182
Yes!

09:29.788 --> 09:31.058
No way!

09:33.666 --> 09:35.476
Corey, you're so sexy.

09:35.477 --> 09:37.553
Corey, you are all man,
and you are all mine.

09:38.248 --> 09:41.280
Oh, Miles, you big hunk
of Florida sunshine.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.752
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me!

09:44.735 --> 09:48.534
Admit it-- they got us bad.

09:48.535 --> 09:51.194
Like the Doc said, it
doesn't work on everyone.

09:51.195 --> 09:52.560
Yeah...

09:53.988 --> 09:55.934
but at least
we look good.

10:08.211 --> 10:09.604
Man, I can't believe

10:09.605 --> 10:11.693
we couldn't
hypnotize our women.

10:12.197 --> 10:13.627
Maybe we missed a step.

10:14.075 --> 10:15.764
Let's go watch
that tape again.

10:19.505 --> 10:21.577
Dad, I think the TV people
are here.

10:22.559 --> 10:23.582
Dad?

10:24.708 --> 10:25.911
Dad!

10:26.835 --> 10:28.001
Dad?

10:28.002 --> 10:29.202
What you looking at?

10:31.905 --> 10:33.104
He's asleep!

10:33.105 --> 10:35.266
We must have
hypnotized him.

10:35.267 --> 10:36.423
Excellent.

10:36.424 --> 10:37.495
Not excellent!

10:37.496 --> 10:39.035
The TV people are here.

10:40.175 --> 10:41.374
I'll get it!

10:41.375 --> 10:42.739
You wake him up--
I'll get the door.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.035
Go.

10:50.615 --> 10:52.345
Ocochobee!

10:54.505 --> 10:55.704
Miles?

10:55.705 --> 10:56.835
Yes!

10:59.068 --> 11:00.504
Mr. Baxter.

11:00.505 --> 11:02.442
I'm TV's Kelly Bryant.

11:02.443 --> 11:03.526
Of course you are.

11:03.527 --> 11:04.923
I love your work.

11:04.924 --> 11:06.187
I'm sure you do.

11:07.010 --> 11:08.326
Kitchen?

11:08.327 --> 11:09.574
Uh... there.

11:09.575 --> 11:12.926
So, are we ready
for our big debut?

11:12.927 --> 11:15.091
Um... actually no.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.358
I sort of
lost track of time.

11:16.359 --> 11:17.706
Well, don't lose any more.

11:17.707 --> 11:18.755
We are going live

11:18.756 --> 11:20.104
in 20 minutes.

11:20.105 --> 11:21.309
Right,
I'll go get ready.

11:21.310 --> 11:23.000
Kapowie.

11:24.263 --> 11:26.585
I hope that's not
your catch phrase.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.403
Of course not.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.401
Hi, I'm Victor Baxter.

11:35.587 --> 11:37.264
Vic Baxter.

11:38.046 --> 11:41.109
Yo, yo, yo, V. Bax
in the... his house.

11:41.110 --> 11:42.793
Daddy, it's on--
the show's on!

11:44.188 --> 11:46.835
Coming up, we're going
live with Kelly Bryant

11:46.836 --> 11:48.805
to the kitchen of Victor Baxter

11:48.806 --> 11:50.952
one of the Bay Area's
favorite chefs.

11:50.953 --> 11:51.943
That's you, Dad!

11:51.944 --> 11:53.407
Yeah, I'm the man.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.764
Don't go away.

11:54.765 --> 11:55.687
We're coming right back

11:55.688 --> 11:58.949
with more
of Hello, San Francisco.

12:05.670 --> 12:09.208
Oh, man, they said
"San Francisco."

12:13.575 --> 12:15.069
What's that wake-up word?

12:15.070 --> 12:17.339
Um... Toke-a-chobee?

12:17.340 --> 12:19.061
Uh, Chokatobee?

12:19.557 --> 12:21.025
Obie Wan Kenobe?

12:21.705 --> 12:23.609
Okay, Victor,
they're all ready for...

12:23.610 --> 12:24.774
Victor?

12:24.775 --> 12:26.461
Honey, I'm glad
to see you're relaxed

12:26.462 --> 12:28.707
but there is
a TV crew downstairs.

12:29.370 --> 12:30.774
Mom...

12:30.775 --> 12:32.484
Dad's kind of hypnotized.

12:33.175 --> 12:35.175
Kind of... hypnotized?

12:35.669 --> 12:37.209
Corey, this isn't funny.

12:37.210 --> 12:38.656
It's not a joke.

12:38.657 --> 12:39.769
I can't wake him up.

12:39.770 --> 12:40.753
Dad, this is so cool!

12:40.754 --> 12:41.333
You should go downstairs

12:41.334 --> 12:42.919
and see all the lights
and cameras and...

12:42.920 --> 12:44.870
Why you laying
on the bed like that for?

12:46.198 --> 12:47.864
Apparently he's hypnotized.

12:47.865 --> 12:48.626
What?

12:48.627 --> 12:49.531
Dad was watching when

12:49.532 --> 12:51.133
Miles and I tried
to hypnotize you guys.

12:51.134 --> 12:53.246
Okay, so, uh,
there was a wake-up word.

12:53.247 --> 12:54.493
Good luck.

12:56.999 --> 12:58.390
Okalobee.

13:00.305 --> 13:01.295
Hokey-Pokey.

13:01.968 --> 13:03.612
"On Top
of Old Smokey"!

13:07.790 --> 13:09.909
Dear... Honey...

13:09.910 --> 13:11.409
You need to wake up.

13:11.410 --> 13:12.832
You wake up

13:12.833 --> 13:14.738
Get up. Get up!

13:14.739 --> 13:16.401
Wake up!

13:17.138 --> 13:18.234
Rae...

13:18.235 --> 13:19.363
this is a disaster.

13:19.364 --> 13:21.405
This show was
your father's big break.

13:21.406 --> 13:23.074
How did you
know I was...?

13:23.740 --> 13:25.974
Did you have a
vision about this?

13:25.975 --> 13:28.852
Yeah, Mom. I knew something
bad was going to happen.

13:28.853 --> 13:30.584
Why didn't you say something?

13:30.585 --> 13:32.869
Because, Ma, I didn't want Dad
to get nervous.

13:32.870 --> 13:33.967
Oh, it worked.

13:33.968 --> 13:35.610
Now he's just unconscious!

13:36.405 --> 13:39.635
Mr. Baxter, we're ready for you.

13:40.364 --> 13:41.775
Okay, let's not panic.

13:41.776 --> 13:43.136
Come on, can't we
just panic a little?

13:43.137 --> 13:44.627
Okay, two seconds.

13:46.711 --> 13:47.889
Now.

13:47.890 --> 13:50.669
Corey. Call Miles,
get the wake-up word.

13:50.670 --> 13:51.753
Okeydoke. Whoop!

13:54.733 --> 13:56.498
Okay, Chelsea,
go down there

13:56.499 --> 13:57.716
and stall as
much as you can.

13:57.717 --> 13:58.439
Okay, I'm on it.

13:58.440 --> 13:59.534
Rae...

13:59.535 --> 14:01.369
Let's get your
father downstairs.

14:01.370 --> 14:02.382
Okay.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.375
And here we have
the refrigerator.

14:06.222 --> 14:08.988
When you open the door,
the light goes on

14:08.989 --> 14:12.078
but when you close the door,
the light goes off.

14:12.079 --> 14:14.636
Or does it? Hmm...

14:16.105 --> 14:18.892
Fascinating. Where is Victor?

14:18.893 --> 14:21.209
We are going on in five minutes.

14:22.151 --> 14:23.111
All right...

14:25.422 --> 14:25.731
There we go.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.171
All right.

14:27.172 --> 14:28.503
Need a little help
in the front.

14:28.504 --> 14:29.905
Okay. Yeah.

14:29.906 --> 14:31.639
Oka. Let's take him

14:31.640 --> 14:32.767
around to the left.

14:32.768 --> 14:34.496
Okay. Mom, get
him, get him...

14:34.497 --> 14:35.622
Yeah. Yeah.

14:37.075 --> 14:39.339
Mamma, I'm losing him. Mama.

14:39.340 --> 14:40.566
Timber!

14:42.895 --> 14:45.505
One, two, three.

14:51.035 --> 14:52.441
That's going to
hurt in the morning.

14:52.442 --> 14:53.421
Definitely.

14:53.422 --> 14:55.605
All right, how we going
to get him downstairs?

14:56.245 --> 14:57.835
Ooh, I got an idea.

14:58.716 --> 15:00.186
Okay, let's
pivot him around.

15:09.481 --> 15:11.464
God, he's heavy.

15:11.465 --> 15:11.853
Ready?

15:11.854 --> 15:12.768
Ready.

15:12.769 --> 15:14.012
One... two...

15:14.965 --> 15:16.216
On two.
On two.

15:16.217 --> 15:17.116
On three, ready?

15:17.117 --> 15:18.475
One, two.

15:20.904 --> 15:22.776
Okay, can we take
a break from this?

15:22.777 --> 15:23.865
Yes. Yes.
Okay.

15:23.866 --> 15:25.246
Let's take
another break.

15:43.375 --> 15:44.844
Get back, get
back, get back.

15:44.845 --> 15:46.943
Wait, let him down,
let him down.

15:53.635 --> 15:55.198
There you go.

16:03.675 --> 16:05.161
Yo, that's tight.

16:05.162 --> 16:06.554
I call next.

16:11.932 --> 16:14.043
Hi. Kelly Bryant here

16:14.044 --> 16:17.772
in the kitchen
of local chef Victor Baxter.

16:17.773 --> 16:20.949
Unfortunately,
the only thing missing is...

16:20.950 --> 16:22.852
Victor Baxter...

16:22.853 --> 16:26.036
...is in the...
his house!

16:27.235 --> 16:29.714
Uh... well, great.

16:29.715 --> 16:31.668
Victor.

16:31.669 --> 16:33.828
What will you be
making for us today?

16:34.606 --> 16:38.441
My husband
will be making...

16:38.442 --> 16:42.269
He's gonna, he's gonna
be making... eggs.

16:42.270 --> 16:43.994
Yes, because...

16:43.995 --> 16:48.697
San Francisco
is the city of eggs.

16:49.105 --> 16:51.739
I thought he was going
to be making trout.

16:51.740 --> 16:53.082
Um, yes.

16:53.083 --> 16:54.638
He's going
to be making...

16:55.928 --> 16:59.447
He's going to be making
trout and eggs.

16:59.448 --> 17:01.996
Trout and eggs? Mmm.

17:01.997 --> 17:05.519
Yeah. That's because
it's the catch of the day

17:05.520 --> 17:08.090
with the hatch
of the day.

17:13.135 --> 17:17.046
Uh, why isn't Victor
telling us this himself?

17:19.075 --> 17:22.854
Oh, that's because
they call him...

17:22.855 --> 17:25.006
"The silent chef."

17:29.275 --> 17:32.608
Yeah, he lets his food
do the talking.

17:33.471 --> 17:35.428
Isn't that right, Dad?

17:41.535 --> 17:42.970
Hey, let's get cooking, Dad.

17:42.971 --> 17:44.842
What do you want
to cook today?

17:47.535 --> 17:49.490
Well, it looks like he
wants to cook some eggs.

17:49.491 --> 17:51.083
Let's cook some eggs.

17:52.575 --> 17:53.639
Let's get it.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.001
Kapowie.

17:57.435 --> 18:01.764
As you can see, my dad
doesn't like to waste a thing.

18:03.405 --> 18:06.404
They call him
the relaxed

18:06.405 --> 18:10.281
silent, nonwasting... chef.

18:11.175 --> 18:12.504
Ooh, Dad.

18:12.505 --> 18:15.421
Uh, why don't we go
to a commercial?

18:15.422 --> 18:18.003
And we'll come
back with more

18:18.004 --> 18:22.632
of the mysterious cooking
styles of Victor Baxter.

18:23.932 --> 18:26.509
Okay, what is going on here?

18:26.510 --> 18:29.004
Uh... the truth is...

18:29.005 --> 18:31.566
my husband was
accidentally hypnotized.

18:33.005 --> 18:35.244
Well, don't look at me like
that, girlfriend. It happens.

18:35.710 --> 18:37.125
But everything
is under control.

18:37.126 --> 18:38.474
Oh, well, it better be

18:38.475 --> 18:39.911
because if he
is not cooking

18:39.912 --> 18:41.705
when we get back, we
are cutting to a clip

18:41.706 --> 18:44.050
on what not to put
in your garbage disposal

18:44.051 --> 18:45.352
and Mr. Floppy here

18:45.353 --> 18:47.863
can just wave his
career good-bye.

18:49.379 --> 18:50.401
Miles, what

18:50.402 --> 18:51.738
is the wake-up word?

18:51.739 --> 18:53.420
Forget it, Rae,
he's not talking.

18:53.421 --> 18:55.616
Not till I get a little sugar.

18:58.975 --> 19:00.134
Okay.

19:00.135 --> 19:02.435
Close your eyes and pucker up.

19:03.735 --> 19:05.734
Rae! Ew!

19:05.735 --> 19:07.134
Don't worry, Chelsea.

19:07.135 --> 19:08.875
I can take one
for the team.

19:12.975 --> 19:14.777
Ooh, pucker up.

19:14.778 --> 19:17.785
Here it comes. Mmm!

19:20.175 --> 19:21.440
Yeah, baby.

19:22.420 --> 19:25.583
A little salty,
but I can taste the love.

19:27.342 --> 19:29.809
Okay loverboy,
what's the word?

19:29.810 --> 19:31.335
Okeechobee.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.253
What's going on?

19:34.708 --> 19:37.976
I'm strapped to a board,
and everything's dark.

19:40.478 --> 19:41.764
Now I can see...

19:41.765 --> 19:44.227
that I'm still
strapped to a board

19:45.066 --> 19:47.456
and the show is going on?

19:47.457 --> 19:49.569
Yeah, but there's still time
to turn it around.

19:49.570 --> 19:51.673
Turn it around?
Rae, where's it going?

19:51.674 --> 19:53.643
Straight down the
tubes, Mr. B.

19:55.256 --> 19:56.907
Yeah. It's a
long story

19:56.908 --> 19:58.579
but, um... Corey and Miles--

19:58.580 --> 20:00.435
they accidentally
hypnotized you.

20:01.243 --> 20:02.689
Well, I can see

20:02.690 --> 20:04.723
my work here is done.

20:04.724 --> 20:06.509
How 'bout a smooch for the road?

20:06.510 --> 20:08.148
How 'bout just
the road?

20:08.149 --> 20:10.589
All right,
move it out, Hot Lips.

20:12.335 --> 20:14.399
Corey, what did you do to me?

20:14.400 --> 20:16.806
Dad, let's not
point fingers, but...

20:16.807 --> 20:18.573
it's all Raven's fault!

20:18.574 --> 20:19.639
What?!

20:20.675 --> 20:22.504
She lied to you
about her vision.

20:22.505 --> 20:25.436
Rae, you said it was
going to be a huge success.

20:25.437 --> 20:27.809
Dad, I was just trying
to give you some confidence.

20:27.810 --> 20:28.469
Well, it worked.

20:28.470 --> 20:30.210
I'm confident that
my career is over.

20:30.211 --> 20:32.191
No, it is not, Dad.

20:32.192 --> 20:33.338
You love to cook

20:33.339 --> 20:35.647
and that's what
people need to see.

20:35.648 --> 20:36.869
You need to get
back on that air

20:36.870 --> 20:38.536
and do what you do best.

20:38.537 --> 20:40.933
You are a great chef

20:40.934 --> 20:42.539
and you don't need a vision
to tell you that.

20:42.540 --> 20:44.901
All right, we're
on in ten seconds.

20:44.902 --> 20:47.542
Are we happening, or do we
cut to the garbage disposal?

20:48.575 --> 20:50.105
We're happening.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.822
Hi. Kelly Bryant here.

20:53.823 --> 20:56.872
We're back with Victor Baxter,
the silent chef.

20:56.873 --> 20:58.504
Actually, Kelly,
the family and I

20:58.505 --> 20:59.984
were just playing
a little joke on you.

20:59.985 --> 21:01.968
Now it's time for
some serious cooking.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.241
Get ready for
my Cajun Trout a la Victor.

21:04.242 --> 21:05.456
You got two minutes.

21:05.457 --> 21:07.320
How about the best omelet
you've ever tasted?

21:07.321 --> 21:10.354
You know, Kelly, the great thing
about making an omelet

21:10.355 --> 21:11.868
is you don't need a recipe.

21:11.869 --> 21:13.669
Just cook right from the heart.

21:13.670 --> 21:15.254
Let's see. We can use

21:15.255 --> 21:16.404
whatever we have
on the counter

21:16.405 --> 21:19.497
and today we have
fresh eggs, a little onion

21:19.498 --> 21:20.699
We got trout.

21:20.700 --> 21:22.622
We don't have time for trout.

21:23.294 --> 21:24.925
We got a
little garlic

21:24.926 --> 21:27.986
a little red pepper,
a little hot sauce

21:27.987 --> 21:30.781
And guess what? Kapowie.

21:41.427 --> 21:44.507
Great segment, Victor,
a- and you were right.

21:44.508 --> 21:46.951
This omelet is... kapowie.

21:46.952 --> 21:49.252
Mm. Tell you what, you give me
more than two minutes

21:49.253 --> 21:50.619
and I'll show you
some real cooking.

21:50.620 --> 21:51.631
You are on.

21:51.632 --> 21:53.847
How about a monthly segment

21:53.848 --> 21:56.409
on Hello, San Francisco?

21:56.410 --> 21:58.385
Okeechobee.

21:59.020 --> 22:00.174
That'd be great.

22:00.175 --> 22:03.791
Because your food
just says San Francisco.

22:05.048 --> 22:06.208
Okeechobee.

22:07.074 --> 22:08.856
I couldn't agree
with you more.
