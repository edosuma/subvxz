I HAD THIS DREAM LAST NIGHT

01:18.083 --> 01:20.041
I WAS THINKING
IT MEANT SOMETHING.

01:20.083 --> 01:23.041
YOU KNOW, SOUTHERN PEACHES
BEING...

01:23.083 --> 01:24.458
I GOT IT.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.458
I HAD A DREAM LAST NIGHT
ABOUT PEACHES.

01:26.500 --> 01:28.542
YEAH, BIG,
SUCCULENT SOUTHERN PEACHES

01:28.583 --> 01:31.750
THAT WENT ROTTEN AND WERE ALL
FILLED WITH MAGGOTS.

01:43.083 --> 01:46.041
DREW'S REPORT ON AFGHANISTAN.
I TOLD HIM I'D PROOF IT.

01:46.083 --> 01:49.041
(chuckles) JUNIOR HIGH
WAS A LOT EASIER WHEN I WENT.

MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT
I DIDN'T CARE SO MUCH.

01:51.750 --> 01:53.500
I WAS TOO INTERESTED
IN BOYS.

01:53.542 --> 01:56.417
(laughs)
WELL, REALLY JUST EDDIE.
IS EDDIE HERE?

01:56.458 --> 01:59.959
NO, HE WENT HOME
TO CHECK ON THE KIDS.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.458
BUT SIMON AND ANGIE--
THEY'RE GETTING A COFFEE.

02:02.500 --> 02:04.458
ANGIE IS FREAKING OUT

IT'S JUST ME

(knock on door)

02:10.583 --> 02:12.375
HOW ARE THEY DOING?

02:12.417 --> 02:14.875
AH, THEY ARE OKAY, BUT IF YOU,
UH, COULD JUST GIVE ME

02:14.917 --> 02:17.750
A COUPLE OF MINUTES ALONE
WITH KAYLA?
WHAT IS IT?

02:17.792 --> 02:19.750
RELAX, HONEY.
LET'S GIVE 'EM THEIR SPACE.

02:19.792 --> 02:22.667
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, I'M
SO WORRIED ABOUT OUR BABIES.

02:22.709 --> 02:25.041
IT'S OKAY.
THEY CAN STAY.

02:25.083 --> 02:26.709
OKAY, UH... KAYLA,

02:26.750 --> 02:29.709
I HAD A LOOK AT YOUR
REPEAT SCANS THIS MORNING.

02:29.750 --> 02:33.333
AND, UH, THE BLOOD CLOT'S NOT
RESOLVING. IT'S GOTTEN WORSE.

02:33.375 --> 02:35.709
SO WHAT DO WE DO?
ANGIE, LISTEN.

02:35.750 --> 02:38.041
I'M SORRY.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT
THE MULTIPLE PREGNANCIES

02:38.083 --> 02:41.500
ARE PUTTING TOO MUCH PRESSURE
ON YOUR VEINS.

02:41.542 --> 02:44.375
SO EVEN WITH THE HEPARIN, YOU'RE
CONTINUING TO FORM NEW CLOTS.

02:44.417 --> 02:46.625
SO WHAT HAPPENS?
WHAT DO YOU DO?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.625
THE PREGNANCY,
OR THE--THE THREE FETUSES,

02:48.667 --> 02:50.959
ARE JUST TOO MUCH
FOR YOUR BODY TO HANDLE.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.041
SO I NEED TO
ALLEVIATE THE PRESSURE

02:53.083 --> 02:54.750
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

02:54.792 --> 02:56.750
THE SAFEST WAY TO DO THAT

02:56.792 --> 02:58.750
WOULD BE TO REDUCE
THE PREGNANCY TO ONE.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.750
(gasps) SO YOU'RE--
YOU'RE SAYING

03:00.792 --> 03:03.041
YOU WANT TO KILL
TWO OF MY BABIES?

03:03.083 --> 03:05.583
IF SHE WASN'T A SURROGATE,
IF THESE WERE HER BABIES,

03:05.625 --> 03:08.625
WOULD YOU BE GIVING
THE SAME ADVICE?
YES.

03:08.667 --> 03:11.959
THEY'RE 20 WEEKS. A FEW MORE,
AND THEY'LL BE VIABLE.
KAYLA DOESN'T HAVE
A FEW MORE WEEKS.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
IF WE WAIT, SHE COULD DIE.

03:24.875 --> 03:26.667
WATCHING YouTube AGAIN?

03:26.709 --> 03:28.542
ACTUALLY, FIFE WAS JUST
BRINGING US UP TO DATE

03:28.583 --> 03:30.542
ON HIS
A.L.S. ANTIBIOTIC TRIAL.

03:30.583 --> 03:32.750
(William) THESE PRELIMINARY
RESULTS ARE ASTOUNDING.

03:32.792 --> 03:35.542
I SAY WE GET THE HUMAN TRIALS UP
AND RUNNING, FULL STEAM AHEAD.
OUTSTANDING.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.583
I'LL START TO PUT TOGETHER
A LARGER SUBJECT GROUP.
(Naomi) WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:38.625 --> 03:41.000
LET'S NOT GET AHEAD
OF OURSELVES.

03:41.041 --> 03:43.000
THE SAFETY TRIALS
AND THE DOSING STUDIES ARE GOOD,

03:43.041 --> 03:45.083
BUT WE STILL NEED
TO GET APPROVAL

03:45.125 --> 03:47.375
BEFORE STARTING
PHASE III TRIALS.
THAT COULD TAKE MONTHS.

03:47.417 --> 03:49.667
THERE ARE PATIENTS OUT THERE
WHO NEED THIS NOW.

03:49.709 --> 03:52.041
THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT
TO WAIT.
I SEEM TO RECALL BEING ASKED
TO BE A MORAL COMPASS HERE,

03:52.083 --> 03:54.583
A CHECK ON THE SLIPPERY SLOPE
OF SCIENCE.

03:54.625 --> 03:57.583
WE'RE GOING DOWNSLOPE
TOO FAST.
TELL YOU WHAT,
I'LL TAKE YOU TO DINNER,

03:57.625 --> 04:00.917
LAY OUT MY PROTOCOL, THE STEPS
I'D TAKE. I'LL WIN YOU OVER.

04:00.959 --> 04:02.834
ACTUALLY,
I HAVE DINNER PLANS.

04:02.875 --> 04:06.041
I WOULD GLADLY SACRIFICE
OUR DATE IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE.
NOW YOU CAN'T SAY NO.

04:06.083 --> 04:07.750
IT'S SETTLED.

04:09.208 --> 04:10.500
OH.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.500
DAMN IT.

04:13.542 --> 04:16.458
I'LL GET IT.
I'LL GET IT.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.709
OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA
CLEAN THIS OFF

04:20.750 --> 04:22.709
SO I CAN GET
A GOOD LOOK AT IT.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.250
IT SHOULDN'T HURT.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.458
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR SQUEEZING US IN.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.834
OUR PEDIATRICIAN BACK HOME NEVER
LET ANYONE JUST SQUEEZE IN.

04:29.875 --> 04:32.291
WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA NEED STITCHES.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.750
JUST A FEW OF THESE BANDAGES
AND SOME ANTIBIOTIC OINTMENT

04:34.792 --> 04:36.750
WILL TAKE GOOD CARE OF THAT.

04:36.792 --> 04:38.959
YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE A SCAR.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.500
OH. YOU OKAY?

04:41.542 --> 04:43.542
I AM.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.500
BUT ELI DOESN'T BELIEVE YOU.

04:45.542 --> 04:47.709
ELI?

04:47.750 --> 04:49.792
ELI IS, UH, MAGGIE'S FRIEND.

04:49.834 --> 04:51.583
SHE'S GOT
A GREAT IMAGINATION.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.041
OKAY.
WELL, NOT TO WORRY, ELI.

04:54.083 --> 04:57.000
UH, MAGGIE WILL BE
JUST FINE. I PROMISE.

04:58.625 --> 05:01.917
HE BELIEVES YOU.
HE'S JUST SAD.

05:01.959 --> 05:04.542
HE THINKS IT WAS HIS FAULT.
OH, WHY IS THAT?

05:04.583 --> 05:07.125
ELI KEPT SAYING THAT WE SHOULD
MAKE SOME NEW FRIENDS HERE...
MM-HMM.

05:07.166 --> 05:09.500
THAT HE'S TIRED
OF JUST EATING LUNCH WITH ME.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.041
HE KEPT BUGGING ME,

05:11.083 --> 05:14.041
SO I WENT OVER TO THESE
TWO GIRLS IN MY GYM CLASS,

05:14.083 --> 05:15.583
AND I INTRODUCED HIM.

05:15.625 --> 05:17.875
BUT THEY WERE VERY RUDE.

05:17.917 --> 05:20.041
YOU INTRODUCED ELI?

05:20.083 --> 05:24.959
IT'S ALWAYS THE SMART KIDS
WHO GET PICKED ON, YOU KNOW?

05:25.000 --> 05:27.417
HEY, YOU GOT A MINUTE?

05:27.458 --> 05:29.041
UH, SURE.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.542
UH, I WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU,
BUT WITH VIOLET BEING GONE--

05:31.583 --> 05:33.834
YOU NEED A PSYCH CONSULT.
YEAH, I GET IT.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.375
UM, 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL

05:35.417 --> 05:37.917
CAME IN WITH AN ABRASION
ON HER FOREHEAD,

05:37.959 --> 05:40.917
AND THEN SHE HAD ME TALK
TO HER IMAGINARY FRIEND.

05:40.959 --> 05:43.542
SEEMS A LITTLE OLD
FOR THAT.
MAYBE. MAYBE NOT.

05:43.583 --> 05:47.041
YOU KNOW, STUDIES HAVE SHOWN
THAT CHILDREN

05:47.083 --> 05:49.709
WITH IMAGINARY FRIENDS
EXCEL ACADEMICALLY.
AT 11?

05:49.750 --> 05:51.709
THE GIRL JUST MOVED HERE.
SHE'S SCARED, SHY.

05:51.750 --> 05:54.041
I'M WORRIED THAT SHE'S USING
THE IMAGINARY FRIEND

05:54.083 --> 05:56.041
TO OSTRACIZE HERSELF.

05:56.083 --> 05:59.041
MAYBE SHE COULD USE SOME HELP
FIGURING OUT HOW TO FIT IN.

05:59.083 --> 06:02.125
SURE. SURE. I HAVE
A CANCELLATION AT, UH, 2:00.
(clicks keyboard keys)

06:02.166 --> 06:03.792
OKAY.

06:03.834 --> 06:06.583
YOU KNOW, THIS THING
WITH CHARLOTTE, I, UH...

06:06.625 --> 06:08.750
I DON'T WANT IT TO BE
UNCOMFORTABLE BETWEEN US.

06:08.792 --> 06:12.041
I MEAN, IF THERE'S A PROBLEM,
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT IT.

06:12.083 --> 06:15.417
SHELDON, I KNOW CHARLOTTE,
AND SHE'S, UM...

06:15.458 --> 06:17.750
FORGET IT.
NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO. WHAT? WHAT?

06:17.792 --> 06:20.041
NO, I--
NO, NO, NO. WHAT?
NO, NO. COME ON. WHAT?

06:20.083 --> 06:22.583
GUY-TO-GUY, MAN-TO-MAN?

06:22.625 --> 06:26.041
SHE'S USING YOU, MAN.
SHE'S USING YOU TO GET TO ME.

06:26.083 --> 06:28.625
AND I HATE WATCHING HER
YANK YOUR CHAIN.

06:28.667 --> 06:32.709
WE'RE HAVING NO PROBLEMS
IN THE CHAIN YANKING DEPARTMENT.
(laughs)

06:32.750 --> 06:35.792
DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU
THAT MAYBE SHE LIKES ME?

06:35.834 --> 06:37.083
NO.

06:39.834 --> 06:42.500
I HATE MY LIFE.
JOIN THE CLUB.

06:42.542 --> 06:45.500
I'M ABOUT TO TERMINATE
TWO OF THREE TRIPLETS

06:45.542 --> 06:48.041
AT 20 WEEKS.

06:48.083 --> 06:51.041
OH, ADDIE. I'M SORRY.
IS THERE NOTHING YOU CAN DO?

06:51.083 --> 06:55.041
NOTHING I CAN DO.

06:55.083 --> 06:57.041
SO... (clears throat)

06:57.083 --> 06:59.625
TELL ME WHY
YOU HATE YOUR LIFE.

06:59.667 --> 07:02.917
WELL, MY CURRENT LOVER
WANTS ME TO GO TO DINNER

07:02.959 --> 07:05.834
WITH THE MAN WHO WANTS TO BE
MY FUTURE LOVER.

07:05.875 --> 07:08.834
I AM A WHORE.
WILLIAM'S MAKING YOU
GO TO DINNER WITH FIFE?

07:08.875 --> 07:10.417
WELL...

07:10.458 --> 07:13.417
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
WALKING THE STREETS, NAI.

07:13.458 --> 07:14.875
THE--THE TWO OF THEM

07:14.917 --> 07:17.041
ARE GANGING UP ON ME
ON THIS DRUG PROTOCOL.

07:17.083 --> 07:20.041
ONLY WITH FIFE, IT DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE A DRUG PROTOCOL DINNER.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.709
IT FEELS, UH... DIRTY.

07:22.750 --> 07:25.875
YOU KNOW, GOOD DIRTY.
(laughs) BUT I--

07:25.917 --> 07:27.667
WILLIAM IS AMAZING.

07:27.709 --> 07:29.959
WHY CAN'T I JUST BE HAPPY
WITH WHAT I HAVE?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.917
A WOMAN THIS MORNING
MISTOOK ME FOR LUCAS' MOTHER.

07:32.959 --> 07:36.083
OH.
NAI, I DON'T WANT TO BE
A MOTHER.

07:36.125 --> 07:39.083
YES, YOU DO.
NO, I DON'T WANT
TO BE A MOTHER,

07:39.125 --> 07:42.667
AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT GONNA
FALL IN LOVE WITH PETE'S KID.
YES, YOU ARE.

07:42.709 --> 07:44.792
HE'S IN LOVE WITH VIOLET.

07:44.834 --> 07:47.125
YEAH, WELL, VIOLET--FOR MANY
REASONS--IS NOT AVAILABLE,

07:47.166 --> 07:49.375
AND YOU ARE,
AND YOU LIKE HIM.

07:49.417 --> 07:51.250
I DO... A LOT.

07:51.291 --> 07:54.291
SO THEN IS THERE ANY REASON WHY
YOU AND PETE CAN'T BE TOGETHER

07:54.333 --> 07:56.917
AND BE HAPPY AND MAYBE BE
A LITTLE FAMILY?

07:58.709 --> 08:02.041
WHAT?

08:02.083 --> 08:03.542
OH.

08:03.583 --> 08:05.542
IS THAT THE NEW GIRLFRIEND?

08:05.583 --> 08:08.125
YEP. THAT'S HER.
HE LIKES HER.

08:08.166 --> 08:10.333
YEP. (clears throat)
HE LIKES HER.

08:10.375 --> 08:13.583
I'M HAPPY HE'S HAPPY.
(mouth full)
HERE THEY COME.

08:13.625 --> 08:16.041
(clears throat)
(knocks on glass)

08:16.083 --> 08:20.041
HEY, SAM.
ADDISON. VANESSA, THIS IS
DR. NAOMI BENNETT, MY EX-WIFE.

08:20.083 --> 08:22.291
HI. PLEASURE.
HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:22.333 --> 08:25.125
(normal voice)
CHECKING UP ON SAM?
(chuckles) ACTUALLY,
I'M HERE TO SEE YOU.

08:25.166 --> 08:28.792
ABOUT KAYLA LINDY. I WAS ASKED
FOR A SECOND OPINION.

08:28.834 --> 08:32.291
KAYLA CALLED YOU?
NO. UH, ANGIE AND SIMON DID.

08:32.333 --> 08:34.625
THEY THINK YOU'RE WRONG.

08:40.208 --> 08:42.208
KAYLA, I KNOW
WHAT WE'RE ASKING.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.250
BUT WE'RE ASKING.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.041
SHE SAYS IT'S SAFE.
AND SHE SAYS IT ISN'T.

08:47.083 --> 08:49.959
(Kayla) THEY'VE WAITED
SO LONG FOR THESE BABIES.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.792
AND WE COULD USE THE MONEY,
WITH THE KIDS' COLLEGE--

08:52.834 --> 08:56.834
BABY, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE MONEY.
KAYLA, I KNOW WHAT YOU WANT,
WHAT YOU ALL WANT,

08:56.875 --> 09:00.041
BUT YOU CANNOT
RISK YOUR LIFE FOR THIS.
BUT THESE BABIES,

09:00.083 --> 09:02.625
THEY'RE ALIVE,
AND WE'RE SO CLOSE.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.417
THEY'RE NOT OUR BABIES.

09:04.458 --> 09:07.041
LOOK, ALL DUE RESPECT,
I CAN'T LOSE MY WIFE.

09:07.083 --> 09:08.375
WE AGREED TO DO THIS,

09:08.417 --> 09:10.417
BUT WE HAVE A FAMILY OF OUR OWN
TO THINK ABOUT HERE.

09:10.458 --> 09:13.417
ALL RIGHT. LET ME REASSURE YOU,
WE WOULD GET THE BEST SURGEON,

09:13.458 --> 09:16.500
AND I THINK THIS IS AN OUTCOME
THAT WILL BE GOOD FOR EVERYONE.

09:16.542 --> 09:18.792
(Addison) I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE ALL WEIGHING,

09:18.834 --> 09:21.291
BUT MY CONCERN IS FOR KAYLA,
AND MY UNEQUIVOCAL OPINION

09:21.333 --> 09:24.208
IS THAT THIS IS NOT
THE RIGHT COURSE.

09:24.250 --> 09:26.041
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

09:26.083 --> 09:28.291
(knocks on doorjamb)

09:28.333 --> 09:30.250
I JUST FINISHED MY MEETING
WITH MAGGIE,

09:30.291 --> 09:32.875
AND I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
TO BE CONCERNED.

09:32.917 --> 09:35.250
SHE'S OSTRACIZING HERSELF?
THE PROBLEM'S
BIGGER THAN THAT,

09:35.291 --> 09:37.250
AND IT'S NOT
A SOCIAL PROBLEM.

09:37.291 --> 09:38.792
I'M AFRAID
SHE'S SCHIZOPHRENIC.

09:38.834 --> 09:41.417
SHE'S 11
WITH AN IMAGINARY FRIEND.

09:41.458 --> 09:43.875
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
IT'S NOT THAT SHE HAS
A FRIEND.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.875
IT'S THAT SHE THINKS
HE'S REAL.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.917
I MEAN, AN 11 YEAR OLD
KNOWS THE DIFFERENCE

09:47.959 --> 09:49.959
BETWEEN WHAT'S REAL
AND WHAT ISN'T REAL.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.959
AND THIS GIRL, I MEAN, ELI IS
MORE REAL TO HER THAN YOU OR ME.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.750
AND SHE'S ISOLATING.
I'M SEEING SIGNS OF PARANOIA.

09:55.792 --> 09:58.750
SHE TOLD ME THAT ELI
DIDN'T TRUST YOU.
DON'T YOU THINK
IF SHE WAS SCHIZOPHRENIC,

09:58.792 --> 10:01.750
HER PARENTS WOULD'VE SEEN
MORE SIGNS?
WELL, IT'S HARD
FOR ANYONE TO SEE IT.

10:01.792 --> 10:03.750
AND SHE MAY BE
JUST AT THE BEGINNING,

10:03.792 --> 10:06.041
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED
TO ADDRESS THIS FAST.

10:06.083 --> 10:09.041
I'M GONNA PRESCRIBE
ANTIPSYCHOTICS.
WHOA. HER BRAIN
IS STILL DEVELOPING.

10:09.083 --> 10:12.041
WE HAVE A WINDOW HERE.
SHE'S GOING TO HIT PUBERTY.

10:12.083 --> 10:15.041
THE ODDS ARE THAT THIS IS
GONNA BE EXPONENTIALLY WORSE.

10:15.083 --> 10:16.875
BUT WHEN WE START
THESE ANTIPSYCHOTICS EARLY,

10:16.917 --> 10:18.875
ABOUT 20% OF THESE KIDS
ARE ABLE TO FUNCTION

10:18.917 --> 10:20.959
AND HAVE A FAIRLY NORMAL LIFE.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
WITHOUT IT,
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CHANCE.
SHE HAD A NORMAL LIFE.
SHE MOVED TO A NEW TOWN.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.000
NOW YOU'RE GONNA PUT HER
ON A MEDICATION

10:26.041 --> 10:28.250
THAT'S GONNA ALTER HER BRAIN
FOREVER. IT'S TOO FAST.

10:28.291 --> 10:32.041
MAGGIE DOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE.
ELI IS TALKING TO HER.

10:32.083 --> 10:35.125
YOU CAME TO ME FOR HELP.
SO LET ME HELP HER.

10:39.083 --> 10:42.250
DR. MONTGOMERY... I KNOW
WHAT YOU MUST THINK OF ME.

10:42.291 --> 10:44.041
BUT I CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN.

10:44.083 --> 10:45.500
I WANTED TO.

10:45.542 --> 10:48.375
I WENT THROUGH YEARS
OF VITAMINS AND SUPPLEMENTS,

10:48.417 --> 10:51.250
I.V.F.,
MISCARRIAGE AFTER MISCARRIAGE.

10:51.291 --> 10:54.458
PEOPLE WHO CAN'T
HAVE CHILDREN...

10:54.500 --> 10:55.959
THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.750
THIS IS MY OTHER OPTION.

10:58.792 --> 11:02.000
THOSE BABIES SHE'S CARRYING...

11:02.041 --> 11:03.750
I'VE ALREADY NAMED THEM.

11:03.792 --> 11:06.375
I'VE ALREADY BONDED WITH THEM,
ALL OF THEM.

11:06.417 --> 11:09.375
AND I KNOW THAT YOU LOOK AT ME
WITH JUDGMENTAL EYES

11:09.417 --> 11:13.166
WHEN I PUSH KAYLA
TO KEEP GOING.

11:13.208 --> 11:15.959
BUT SHE'S MY LAST CHANCE.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.208
I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL.
I DO.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.500
BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT THIS
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I WANT

11:20.542 --> 11:22.041
OR IT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

11:22.083 --> 11:24.417
I HAVE TO DO
WHAT IS RIGHT FOR KAYLA.

11:29.291 --> 11:31.458
SCHIZOPHRENIA?

11:31.500 --> 11:34.166
NO.
MAGGIE'S A GOOD KID.

11:34.208 --> 11:37.375
SHE MAKES GOOD GRADES.
SHE LOVES TO READ.

11:37.417 --> 11:40.333
I MEAN, TELL 'EM ABOUT THE TYPES
OF THINGS THAT SHE PAINTS.

11:40.375 --> 11:43.333
UH, THE COLORS, THE SWIRLS--
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

11:43.375 --> 11:46.041
THIS IS NOT A CONDEMNATION
OF YOUR DAUGHTER.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.041
SHE HAS
A PHYSIOLOGICAL DISORDER.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.041
SHE INVENTED A FRIEND
TO TALK TO.

11:50.083 --> 11:53.458
SHE HAS TROUBLE GETTING ALONG
WITH OTHER KIDS SOMETIMES.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.458
THAT DOESN'T MAKE HER CRAZY.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.166
IT MAKES HER DIFFERENT.

11:57.208 --> 12:00.333
IT MAKES HER SMART.
IT'S A COPING MECHANISM.

12:00.375 --> 12:04.500
ISN'T THAT
WHAT YOU GUYS CALL IT?
YES, IF SHE WERE DOING THIS,
BUT SHE'S NOT.

12:04.542 --> 12:06.458
ELI IS NOT HER CREATION.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:08.542 --> 12:11.041
I THINK YOUR DAUGHTER
IS STRUGGLING WITH SOMETHING,

12:11.083 --> 12:13.041
AND THAT'S WHY I WENT
TO DR. WALLACE.

12:13.083 --> 12:16.041
AND HE'S THE EXPERT.
I KNOW THIS ISN'T
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.667
BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT A SOCIAL
ADJUSTMENT AFTER A MOVE.

12:18.709 --> 12:21.166
YOUR DAUGHTER
NEEDS TO BE TREATED,

12:21.208 --> 12:23.250
BECAUSE WHAT YOU THINK OF NOW
AS HER QUIRKS

12:23.291 --> 12:26.375
COULD VERY RAPIDLY
BECOME DESTRUCTIVE.
(man) NO. THEY DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT.

12:26.417 --> 12:29.166
JOE, PLEASE--
NO. YOU WANT
TO CALL MY DAUGHTER CRAZY

12:29.208 --> 12:31.375
AND LOCK HER UP SOMEWHERE?

12:31.417 --> 12:34.417
NO. I DON'T BUY IT.
LET'S GO.

12:34.458 --> 12:37.625
(Sheldon)
MR. ROBERTS, PLEASE--
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

12:44.458 --> 12:47.000
I'M SORRY.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.250
YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?

13:03.291 --> 13:05.250
(chuckles) SORRY.

13:05.291 --> 13:08.041
IT'S AN IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION
YOU HAVE HERE.

13:08.083 --> 13:10.041
THANKS. IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANTED?

13:10.083 --> 13:12.041
YOU GOT ME THINKING
THIS MORNING,

13:12.083 --> 13:14.333
AT THE DISCUSSION
OF THE A.L.S. TRIALS.

13:14.375 --> 13:16.333
I'VE READ ABOUT
ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS

13:16.375 --> 13:18.959
BEING USED TO SLOW THE RATE
OF MUSCULAR DETERIORATION.

13:19.000 --> 13:20.750
VALINE, LEUCINE, ISOLEUCINE.

13:20.792 --> 13:23.291
GOOD. YOU ARE UP
ON THE LITERATURE.
THE RESULTS ARE INCONCLUSIVE.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.583
WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED
IN STUDYING IT FURTHER

13:25.625 --> 13:28.083
AS AN ADJUNCT TO FIFE'S WORK?

13:28.125 --> 13:30.750
ONE GROUP GETS HIS PROTOCOL,
ONE CONTROL GROUP, OF COURSE,

13:30.792 --> 13:33.041
AND A THIRD GROUP
GETS AMINO ACIDS.

13:33.083 --> 13:36.417
THIS... CAME TO YOU
THIS MORNING?

13:39.542 --> 13:42.166
LOOKS LIKE
I LOOSENED IT UP FOR YOU.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.208
THINK ABOUT IT, DR. WILDER.

13:44.250 --> 13:47.208
I WILL THINK ABOUT IT.

13:47.250 --> 13:50.000
YOU WANT TO SHAKE ON IT?
I WANT YOU
TO HOLD OUT YOUR HAND.

13:50.041 --> 13:52.041
WHY IS THAT?
YOU COULDN'T HOLD THE MUG
THIS MORNING,

13:52.083 --> 13:53.750
YOU COULDN'T OPEN THE JAR NOW,

13:53.792 --> 13:57.041
AND YOU'RE HERE
ASKING FOR MY HELP.

13:57.083 --> 13:59.041
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN SICK?

13:59.083 --> 14:00.667
(inhales deeply)

14:00.709 --> 14:03.834
(exhales) I WAS DIAGNOSED
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

14:03.875 --> 14:07.583
IT WAS IN REMISSION
TILL LAST SPRING.

14:09.208 --> 14:11.500
I'M SORRY.

14:11.542 --> 14:12.959
DOES NAOMI KNOW?

14:13.000 --> 14:15.959
NO. I DON'T INTEND TO LET
WHATEVER IT IS WE HAVE

14:16.041 --> 14:17.542
BE COLORED BY PITY.

14:17.583 --> 14:20.875
I'M ENJOYING IT.
I THINK I'M ENTITLED.
AND WHAT ABOUT HER?

14:20.917 --> 14:23.417
I'D ASK THAT YOU RESPECT
MY WISHES. YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

14:23.458 --> 14:26.375
YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND,
IT'S UP TO THE PATIENT

14:26.417 --> 14:30.333
TO DECIDE WHEN AND HOW
TO DISCLOSE THINGS LIKE THIS.
I'M NOT YOUR DOCTOR.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.375
NO, BUT YOU WORK
BY CERTAIN STANDARDS

14:32.417 --> 14:34.375
OR NAOMI WOULDN'T HAVE
HIRED YOU.

14:34.417 --> 14:36.417
THINK ABOUT THE STUDY, PETE.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.000
I CAN USE
ALL THE HELP I CAN GET.

14:45.417 --> 14:47.166
FORGET EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED

14:47.208 --> 14:49.041
OR HASN'T HAPPENED
BETWEEN US.

14:49.083 --> 14:52.500
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY TO YOU
IS STRICTLY PROFESSIONAL

14:52.542 --> 14:54.291
AS A PHYSICIAN
AND YOUR BUSINESS PARTNER.

14:54.333 --> 14:55.375
OKAY.

14:55.417 --> 14:58.041
YOUR GIRLFRIEND SUCKS.

14:58.083 --> 15:01.458
IS THAT YOUR PROFESSIONAL
AND MEDICAL OPINION?

15:01.500 --> 15:03.041
SHE'S INTERFERING
WITH MY PATIENT,

15:03.083 --> 15:04.917
CONTRADICTING
MY MEDICAL ADVICE

15:04.959 --> 15:07.917
AND PUTTING KAYLA'S LIFE
AT RISK.
VANESSA WAS ASKED
FOR A SECOND OPINION.

15:07.959 --> 15:10.041
SHE'S A VERY GOOD DOCTOR.
NOT AS GOOD AS I AM.

15:10.083 --> 15:13.625
WHAT? YOU WANT ME TO PRETEND
THAT I'M NOT AMAZING?

15:13.667 --> 15:16.166
BECAUSE WE BOTH KNOW THAT I AM.
LOOK, JUST ASK HER TO BACK OFF.

15:16.208 --> 15:17.875
WELL, I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T DO THAT.
WHY NOT?

15:17.917 --> 15:19.917
BECAUSE I'M DOING
KAYLA'S SURGERY.

15:26.083 --> 15:28.667
PUSHING THROUGH
TO THE INFERIOR VENA CAVA.

15:28.709 --> 15:31.041
NICE. SHOULD BLOCK
ANY CLOTS FROM GOING HIGHER.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.542
IF THEY FORM
BELOW THE UMBRELLA.
YOU CAN'T LET THIS GO?

15:33.583 --> 15:36.834
IT'S MY PATIENT ON THE TABLE,
SO, NO.
(Sam) GUYS.

15:36.875 --> 15:39.125
(Vanessa) HE'S GOOD.
YES.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.041
I CAN IMAGINE IT'S USEFUL,

15:41.083 --> 15:43.417
HAVING A PRACTICE WITH
ALL THESE DIFFERENT SPECIALTIES.

15:43.458 --> 15:46.500
YOU CAN RELY ON EACH OTHER,
USE EACH OTHER.
EXCEPT FOR WHEN THEY IGNORE
YOUR MEDICAL ADVICE

15:46.542 --> 15:50.041
AND DO WHAT THEIR GIRLFRIENDS
TELL THEM TO DO.
(Sam) OKAY,
I AM DELICATELY THREADING

15:50.083 --> 15:52.041
A 10-MILLIMETER
MICROMESH UMBRELLA

15:52.083 --> 15:54.500
INSIDE THE LARGEST VEIN
OF THIS WOMAN'S BODY.

15:54.542 --> 15:57.583
SO EITHER BE QUIET...

15:57.625 --> 16:00.000
OR GET THE HELL OUT.

16:00.041 --> 16:03.000
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

16:06.417 --> 16:09.000
YOU GOT IT?
I GOT IT.

16:09.041 --> 16:10.709
HE GOT IT.

16:12.291 --> 16:15.500
AHH.

16:20.792 --> 16:22.291
HMM.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.417
(sighs)

16:27.417 --> 16:29.417
MM.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.792
OH.

16:37.834 --> 16:39.667
HUH.

16:44.667 --> 16:45.625
OH.

16:45.667 --> 16:47.000
(grunts)

16:49.417 --> 16:52.625
(both grunting)

16:55.625 --> 16:57.834
AH!
OH!

17:00.083 --> 17:01.583
WHOA! OH!

17:01.625 --> 17:04.625
(grunting)

17:08.083 --> 17:10.834
ENOUGH!

17:13.083 --> 17:16.041
(pants)

17:16.083 --> 17:18.375
(exhales)

17:18.417 --> 17:20.000
(sighs)

17:22.000 --> 17:24.417
TO ALL GOOD THINGS.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.208
WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

17:32.250 --> 17:35.041
UH, Y-YOU SURPRISE ME.

17:35.083 --> 17:38.166
I JUST FIGURED YOU'D BE
HAMMERING ME ABOUT A.L.S.

17:38.208 --> 17:40.375
AND URGENCY
AND GIVING ME THE HARD SELL.

17:40.417 --> 17:42.083
FINE. HERE'S THE HARD SELL.

17:42.125 --> 17:43.625
A.L.S. RAVAGES THE BODY,

17:43.667 --> 17:46.083
PATIENTS ARE LEFT UNABLE
TO BREATHE ON THEIR OWN,

17:46.125 --> 17:48.041
AND EVENTUALLY SUFFOCATE
ON THEIR OWN FLUIDS.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.041
AND TO HOLD OFF
ON FINDING A CURE

17:50.083 --> 17:53.166
TO FOLLOW GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES
THAT ARE OVERLY CAUTIOUS

17:53.208 --> 17:55.208
AND STALLED
BY BUREAUCRATIC RED TAPE?

17:55.250 --> 17:57.417
IT IS BENEATH THE QUALITY
OF EVERYTHING WE DO.

17:57.458 --> 17:59.417
NOW LET'S GET DRUNK.

17:59.458 --> 18:02.583
SO WE'RE--WE'RE--
WE'RE DONE TALKING A.L.S.?

18:02.625 --> 18:06.041
I HOPE SO. THAT MAKES
FOR A LOUSY DATE.
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS NOT A DATE.

18:06.083 --> 18:08.458
MM.
NO, THIS IS
A BUSINESS DINNER.

18:08.500 --> 18:09.458
REALLY?

18:09.500 --> 18:11.500
A HOT GUY ON EIGHT WHEELS

18:11.542 --> 18:14.041
SITTING ACROSS
FROM A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN?

18:14.083 --> 18:16.041
FEELS LIKE A DATE TO ME.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.917
♪♪♪

18:18.959 --> 18:20.917
THE SURGERY WENT OKAY,
YOU KNOW,

18:20.959 --> 18:22.917
BUT THAT VANESSA IS NOT NICE.

18:22.959 --> 18:24.542
I MEAN, MAYBE SHE'S NICE.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.542
SHE'S JUST WRONG FOR SAM,
YOU KNOW?

18:26.583 --> 18:29.291
(Lucas babbling)
OH, HE'S... HE'S UP?

18:29.333 --> 18:31.667
(continues babbling)
I MEAN, "UP" UP?

18:31.709 --> 18:33.709
YEAH, HE'S UP.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.709
HEY, LISTEN,
IF I TOLD YOU SOMETHING

18:35.750 --> 18:38.959
AND TOLD YOU
YOU COULDN'T TELL NAOMI--
I'D TELL NAI.
I TELL HER EVERYTHING.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.709
WELL, YOU DIDN'T TELL HER
ABOUT SAM.

18:41.750 --> 18:44.250
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT.
WHAT'S THE THING?
I'M NOT TELLING YOU NOW.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.500
AND IT'S NOT A THING.
IT'S A CONCERN.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.166
OH.

18:49.208 --> 18:51.166
(babbles)

18:51.208 --> 18:52.667
WELL... (clears throat)

18:52.709 --> 18:54.166
(keys jangle)

18:54.208 --> 18:56.333
YOU'RE NOT
SPENDING THE NIGHT?

18:56.375 --> 19:00.041
NO, NO. HE'S UP, AND YOU'RE
GONNA SPEND SOME TIME WITH HIM,

19:00.083 --> 19:02.709
SOME, YOU KNOW...
FAMILY TIME.

19:02.750 --> 19:04.875
ARE YOU FREAKED OUT
BECAUSE THAT WOMAN

19:04.917 --> 19:06.875
THOUGHT YOU WERE HIS MOTHER?
NO. (chuckles)

19:06.917 --> 19:10.041
I-I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY.
FUNNY?

19:10.083 --> 19:11.667
YEAH.

19:11.709 --> 19:13.291
ADDISON, WHERE DO WE STAND?

19:13.333 --> 19:15.291
WHERE DO WE STAND?

19:15.333 --> 19:17.750
YOU'RE... YOU'RE ASKING ME
JUST LIKE THAT?

19:17.792 --> 19:20.500
YEAH, I'M ASKING YOU
JUST LIKE THAT.

19:20.542 --> 19:24.291
WELL, UM, YOU...
ARE IN LOVE WITH VIOLET.
MAYBE I COULD BE
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.792
PETE--
MAYBE WE COULD BE MORE THAN
JUST YOU TALKING INCESSANTLY

19:27.834 --> 19:29.792
ABOUT SAM AND HIS GIRLFRIEND
AND RUNNING OFF

19:29.834 --> 19:32.583
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
BECAUSE MY BABY SPOOKS YOU.
THAT IS NOT WHAT'S--

19:32.625 --> 19:34.750
WELL, IT FEELS LIKE WHAT'S...

DO YOU TWO DO TOGETHER?

28:36.417 --> 28:37.834

29:15.834 --> 29:18.542
WHAT THINGS DOES ELI SAY?

29:22.792 --> 29:25.041
IS HE TALKING TO YOU NOW?

29:25.083 --> 29:26.709
HE'S ANGRY.

29:26.750 --> 29:29.709
HE DOESN'T WANT ME TO TELL YOU
ABOUT THE BAD STUFF.

29:29.750 --> 29:32.542
MAGGIE, I KNOW THIS IS HARD.

29:32.583 --> 29:36.333
BUT YOU CAN TELL ME.
I WON'T LET HIM HURT YOU.

29:39.750 --> 29:42.709
ELI DIDN'T LIKE ME
SPENDING TIME WITH MUNCHIE.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.500
WHO'S MUNCHIE?

29:44.542 --> 29:46.625
MY CAT.

29:46.667 --> 29:49.500
ELI WAS JEALOUS.

29:49.542 --> 29:52.083
HE WANTED MUNCHIE
TO GO AWAY.

29:56.041 --> 29:59.041
HE TOLD ME THAT MUNCHIE WANTED
TO GO INTO THE LAKE.

29:59.083 --> 30:02.041
SO I TOOK HIM TO THE ONE
BEHIND OUR HOUSE.

30:02.083 --> 30:05.709
AND THEN HE TOLD ME
TO JUST HOLD HIM THERE,

30:05.750 --> 30:07.500
UNDERWATER.

30:07.542 --> 30:12.375
AND HE FOUGHT,
AND HE SCRATCHED...

30:12.417 --> 30:16.000
(voice breaking) BUT I DID
WHAT ELI TOLD ME...

30:17.709 --> 30:19.208
UNTIL...

30:22.333 --> 30:24.291
HE STOPPED MOVING.

30:24.333 --> 30:27.625
OH, MY GOD.
I THOUGHT IT RAN AWAY.
SHE'S UPSET.

30:27.667 --> 30:30.583
HE IS UPSETTING HER.
I WANT THIS STOPPED NOW!

30:30.625 --> 30:32.583
JOE, THIS ISN'T GONNA STOP,
NOT UNLESS WE HELP HER.

30:32.625 --> 30:36.792
I AM NOT LOCKING UP MY DAUGHTER.
I WANT THIS STOPPED!

30:43.458 --> 30:44.750
(water runs)

30:44.792 --> 30:46.417
(water stops)

30:50.083 --> 30:52.625
(water running)

30:52.667 --> 30:55.834
I WANTED TO HELP THEM.
I BELIEVED I WAS RIGHT.

30:55.875 --> 30:58.166
SO PLEASE SPARE ME
THE CONDESCENDING

30:58.208 --> 31:01.041
"WE ALL MAKE BAD CALLS" SPEECH.
I'VE HEARD IT BEFORE.
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY.

31:01.083 --> 31:02.542
I WAS GONNA SAY
THAT YOU SCREWED UP.

31:02.583 --> 31:05.375
YOU SCREWED UP ROYALLY, AND NOW
I HAVE TO CLEAN UP YOUR MESS.

31:05.417 --> 31:08.041
SO YOU CAN SCRUB IN WITH ME
IF YOU WANT,

31:08.083 --> 31:11.166
BUT IN MY O.R., YOU WILL SHUT UP
AND DO AS YOUR TOLD.
OKAY, THAT FELT PERSONAL.

31:11.208 --> 31:14.792
IT WASN'T.
ARE YOU REALLY MAD AT ME
OR SAM?

31:14.834 --> 31:16.834
MAYBE BEFORE I WAS
REALLY MAD AT SAM.

31:16.875 --> 31:19.625
BUT NOW THAT
MY PATIENT MIGHT DIE

31:19.667 --> 31:21.041
BECAUSE OF YOUR BAD CALL,

31:21.083 --> 31:23.792
I'M REALLY MAD AT YOU.

31:28.667 --> 31:31.875
AND HOW ARE YOU
ON THIS FINE DAY, DR. WILDER?

31:31.917 --> 31:33.917
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.

31:33.959 --> 31:36.041
BEFORE YESTERDAY, BEFORE...

31:36.083 --> 31:38.083
WILLIAM GAVE YOU
THE GREEN LIGHT,

31:38.125 --> 31:41.041
WERE YOU GONNA PROCEED
MORE CAUTIOUSLY?
THIS IS NOT ME
BEING RECKLESS.

31:41.083 --> 31:43.375
THE MAN WHO SIGNS OUR PAYCHECKS
IS COMFORTABLE

31:43.417 --> 31:45.417
THERE ARE NO ISSUES HERE.

31:47.709 --> 31:50.250
IF YOU KNEW THAT WILLIAM
HAD HIS OWN AGENDA

31:50.291 --> 31:52.500
THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOURS

31:52.542 --> 31:54.500
AND THAT'S WHY HE HAS YOU
MOVING FAST,

31:54.542 --> 31:57.291
WOULD THAT CHANGE ANYTHING?
WHAT AGENDA?

31:57.333 --> 32:00.542
JUST DO IT RIGHT, OKAY?

32:00.583 --> 32:03.000
WHAT AGENDA?

32:05.041 --> 32:09.000
HE NEEDS THE TREATMENT
FOR HIMSELF.

32:11.083 --> 32:12.000
HMM.

32:13.750 --> 32:16.208
(taps fingers)
DOES NAOMI KNOW?

32:16.250 --> 32:19.875
NO.
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

32:19.917 --> 32:21.834
BECAUSE THIS SHOULD BE
DONE RIGHT.

32:21.875 --> 32:23.041
WHATEVER YOUR AGENDA IS,

32:23.083 --> 32:26.083
I'M COUNTING ON YOU
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

32:28.166 --> 32:30.041
(sighs)

32:30.083 --> 32:32.041
(Sheldon) YOU'RE ANGRY.

32:32.083 --> 32:34.041
YOU'RE ANGRY AT ME,
AND I'M SORRY.

32:34.083 --> 32:37.041
BUT I ALSO SEE
THAT YOU'RE SCARED.
I AM NOT SCARED.

32:37.083 --> 32:39.750
SEEING THIS HAPPEN
TO A CHILD YOU LOVE IS SCARY,

32:39.792 --> 32:42.750
AND KNOWING WHAT SOMEONE
YOU LOVE IS CAPABLE OF IS SCARY.

32:42.792 --> 32:44.166
WHAT'S SCARY IS YOU.

32:44.208 --> 32:47.041
YOU WANT TO LOCK UP
A LITTLE GIRL,

32:47.083 --> 32:50.083
TAKE HER AWAY FROM US
A-AND MAKE HER DIFFERENT.

32:50.125 --> 32:54.041
NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT
TAKING HER AWAY.
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAY NOW.

32:54.083 --> 32:56.458
AND THEN YOU PUT DRUGS IN HER
AND YOU LOCK HER UP

32:56.500 --> 32:58.458
AND YOU DON'T LET US
SEE HER AGAIN.

32:58.500 --> 33:01.125
AND I WON'T ALLOW THAT.
NO, I WON'T!
JOE--

33:01.166 --> 33:02.458
NO!

33:02.500 --> 33:04.500
WHO DID THEY TAKE AWAY
FROM YOU, JOE?

33:06.625 --> 33:08.959
JOE?

33:12.083 --> 33:14.041
MY SISTER.

33:14.083 --> 33:17.041
BUT I... I THOUGHT
YOUR SISTER DIED.

33:17.083 --> 33:20.166
JOE, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR SISTER?

33:20.208 --> 33:24.000
SHE STARTED, UH,
HEARING VOICES.

33:24.041 --> 33:26.834
GOD WAS TALKING TO HER.

33:26.875 --> 33:29.041
MY PARENTS TOOK HER
TO THE DOCTORS.

33:29.083 --> 33:31.583
AND... THEY TOOK HER AWAY.

33:31.625 --> 33:34.542
THEY LOCKED HER UP
AND THEY CALLED HER CRAZY,

33:34.583 --> 33:36.333
AND SHE KILLED HERSELF.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.333
OH, HONEY.

33:40.375 --> 33:42.417
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

33:42.458 --> 33:44.417
BECAUSE IT'S MY FAULT
THAT MAGGIE'S SICK.

33:44.458 --> 33:48.041
IT'S IN MY FAMILY.
IT'S IN MY BLOOD.

33:48.083 --> 33:50.375
AND IF THEY'D
JUST LET HER BE,

33:50.417 --> 33:52.041
IT WOULD'VE BEEN FINE.

33:52.083 --> 33:53.750
(sighs)

33:53.792 --> 33:56.041
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

33:56.083 --> 33:58.125
BUT TREATMENT HAS EVOLVED.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.959
THEY DON'T JUST LOCK UP
PEOPLE WITH THIS DISEASE

34:01.000 --> 34:02.125
AND THROW AWAY THE KEY.

34:02.166 --> 34:04.417
WE CAN FIND MEDICATIONS
AND WORK THERAPEUTICALLY,

34:04.458 --> 34:06.417
AND YOU'LL BE RIGHT THERE
WITH HER

34:06.458 --> 34:09.041
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.
(Cooper) YOU CAN'T IGNORE IT.

34:09.083 --> 34:11.041
YOU CAN'T PRETEND
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

34:11.083 --> 34:13.375
IF YOU ACCEPT IT,
IT CAN GET BETTER.

34:13.417 --> 34:15.917
SHE CAN GET BETTER.

34:22.041 --> 34:24.041
SPINAL NEEDLE AND K.C.L.
ADJUSTING THE PROBE.

34:24.083 --> 34:26.208
(monitor beeping erratically)
PULSE OX IS 86.

34:26.250 --> 34:28.792
SHE'S THROWING P.V.C.s.
SHE'S THROWING ANOTHER CLOT,
A BIG ONE.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.041
ALL RIGHT.
RAISE THE OXYGEN TO 100.

34:31.083 --> 34:32.917
WE NEED TO GET HER
OFF THE TABLE, INTO I.C.U.

34:32.959 --> 34:34.709
I'VE LOST HER PULSE.
SHE'S IN FIB. CRASH CART.

34:34.750 --> 34:38.917
(motor whirring)

34:38.959 --> 34:41.917
UH, I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THE DRUG PROTOCOL.

34:41.959 --> 34:44.041
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT THAT, ACTUALLY.

34:44.083 --> 34:48.625
I WAS, UM, I WAS JUST SITTING
HERE THINKING ABOUT MAYA.

34:48.667 --> 34:50.625
AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID,

34:50.667 --> 34:53.041
ABOUT HOW HORRIBLE
THIS DISEASE IS

34:53.083 --> 34:57.041
AND HOW COULD I
LET SOMEONE SUFFER.

34:57.083 --> 35:00.583
AND IF THAT WERE SOMEBODY
THAT I LOVED...

35:00.625 --> 35:03.917
I LOOKED OVER YOUR PROTOCOL
TOP TO BOTTOM,

35:03.959 --> 35:06.041
AND IT LOOKS GOOD.

35:06.083 --> 35:09.333
SO IF YOU AND WILLIAM
ARE OKAY WITH IT,

35:09.375 --> 35:11.000
I'M IN.

35:14.083 --> 35:16.041
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE
APPRECIATIVE.

35:16.083 --> 35:17.834
I AM, UH, BUT, UH,

35:17.875 --> 35:19.917
I ALSO CONSIDERED
YOUR ARGUMENT.

35:19.959 --> 35:22.041
AND WHILE I APPRECIATE
THE GREEN LIGHT,

35:22.083 --> 35:25.041
I-I DON'T KNOW THAT WHAT
WILLIAM AND I WANT IS RIGHT,

35:25.083 --> 35:28.041
U-UNLESS WE DO THIS...
THE RIGHT WAY.

35:28.083 --> 35:32.375
GET THE PROPER APPROVALS,
MAKE SURE.

35:32.417 --> 35:36.792
WHAT CAN I SAY?
YOU'RE RUBBING OFF ON ME.

35:36.834 --> 35:38.667

35:40.417 --> 35:42.583

36:20.083 --> 36:22.208
I, UH...

36:44.166 --> 36:46.250
IS SHE OKAY?

36:48.458 --> 36:50.375

36:50.417 --> 36:53.125
EDDIE, UH...

36:53.166 --> 36:56.041
THE CLOT WENT INTO HER LUNG,
AND HER HEART STOPPED.

36:56.083 --> 37:00.041
IT TOOK US FIVE MINUTES
TO GET IT STARTED BEATING AGAIN.

37:00.083 --> 37:02.417

WAS WITHOUT OXYGEN.

37:02.458 --> 37:07.041
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

37:07.083 --> 37:09.291

37:09.333 --> 37:12.041

37:14.417 --> 37:17.041

GOT TO THE PROCEDURE.

WHAT...

IT MEANS THAT SO LONG

WILL CONTINUE TO GROW.

37:36.083 --> 37:38.041

THIS WAS TOO DANGEROUS.
