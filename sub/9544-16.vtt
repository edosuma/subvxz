00:34.738 --> 00:36.801
Hey, Jamie. Jamie,
what did I say?

00:36.836 --> 00:38.899
Not so high.
You're gonna break your neck.

00:38.934 --> 00:42.496
And you know who they're gonna blame?
They're gonna blame me.

00:42.531 --> 00:44.090
- What?
- Hungry.

00:44.125 --> 00:45.839
You can't be hungry. You just ate.

00:45.874 --> 00:49.534
Where's the other one?
The, uh, the... the little guy?

00:49.569 --> 00:51.140
Hey, have you seen Tommy?

00:51.175 --> 00:52.274
No.

00:52.309 --> 00:54.092
Tommy.

00:54.692 --> 00:57.010
Tommy!

00:57.710 --> 00:58.950
Tommy!

00:58.985 --> 01:01.431
All units be advised...
We have a missing child.

01:01.466 --> 01:04.095
Two years old, male, Caucasian.

01:04.129 --> 01:08.339
Last seen at Edgewater Park wearing
a red polo shirt and blue pants.

01:08.374 --> 01:11.952
His name is Tommy Grazer.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.165
Stand by. I think we got him.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.245
Hi, big guy.

01:28.437 --> 01:31.370
Everybody's lookin' for you.

01:31.405 --> 01:33.132
What've you got there?

01:33.167 --> 01:35.611
What have you got there, big guy?

01:35.646 --> 01:39.504
Oh my God.
Where did you get this?

01:40.159 --> 01:42.427
MONK Season 3 Epi. 16
Mr. Monk and the Kid

02:36.421 --> 02:39.738
- Is there any word from the hospitals?
- Not yet, we're still checking.

02:39.773 --> 02:43.507
All right. We need to talk to anybody
who was in the park or near the park.

02:43.542 --> 02:46.119
- We're going to lock it down.
- Sir, it's three and a half acres.

02:46.154 --> 02:47.941
Lock it down and keep it locked down.

02:47.976 --> 02:50.915
If there's a body here
we're gonna find it if it takes all night.

02:50.950 --> 02:53.092
Hey, Monk, Natalie,
thanks for comin'.

02:53.127 --> 02:55.349
Hey, we just got your call.
I didn't quite understand it.

02:55.384 --> 02:58.288
- You found a body?
- Uh, not quite.

02:58.323 --> 03:00.714
But there's a two-year-old boy
named Tommy Grazer...

03:00.749 --> 03:04.348
Uh, not two years, twenty-two months.
Not quite two.

03:04.383 --> 03:08.588
Whatever. Anyway, um, he was, um,
separated from his mother...

03:08.623 --> 03:11.543
His, uh, guardian.
She's not actually his mother.

03:11.578 --> 03:14.078
She, uh, runs a foster home.

03:14.113 --> 03:15.714
For the record.

03:15.749 --> 03:19.526
For the record, stand over there.

03:20.993 --> 03:23.865
Anyway, he was in the playground,
and he disappeared for like ten minutes...

03:23.900 --> 03:28.020
Uh, 14 minutes.

03:29.444 --> 03:34.153
When we found him the little guy
had a severed human finger.

03:34.188 --> 03:35.882
- A finger?
- A pinkie.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.109
It was still bleeding, freshly severed.

03:38.144 --> 03:40.888
- Probably about four hours ago.
- Yeah, about four hours ago.

03:40.923 --> 03:44.479
I just said that, Randy.

03:45.656 --> 03:47.612
Just a finger?

03:47.647 --> 03:49.460
Yeah. So far.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.805
Now, we're not telling the press anything.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.749
All we're telling them
is that somebody found a body part.

03:54.784 --> 03:57.002
We're not giving them any details.

03:57.037 --> 03:58.653
Where did he find it?

03:58.688 --> 04:00.670
The boy's not talking.

04:00.705 --> 04:02.698
Maybe he hates cops.

04:02.733 --> 04:05.440
Maybe he's two years old.

04:07.049 --> 04:09.007
Tommy?

04:09.042 --> 04:11.355
This is Adrian Monk and Natalie Teeger.

04:11.390 --> 04:13.973
And this is Mrs. Novak,
the boy's legal guardian.

04:14.008 --> 04:15.800
Hey, you can't keep us here.
We haven't done anything.

04:15.835 --> 04:20.192
Mrs. Novak, I promise you we'll get you
out of here just as soon as we can.

04:20.226 --> 04:23.342
Hi. Hi, sweetie.
My name is Natalie.

04:23.377 --> 04:24.826
Give me five.

04:24.861 --> 04:29.101
Yeah. Hey, this is my friend.
His name is Mr. Monk.

04:29.136 --> 04:32.256
- He's gonna talk to you for
a minute, okay? - Monk.

04:32.291 --> 04:34.234
He's a very nice man.

04:34.269 --> 04:38.501
- You're pretty good with kids.
- Oh. It's sort of my job.

04:38.536 --> 04:40.846
Hello, my... my name is Adrian Monk.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.780
- Monk.
- That's right.

04:42.815 --> 04:45.602
I'm working with the police department.

04:45.637 --> 04:47.419
Technically,
I'm here as a consultant.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.356
Do you understand consultant?

04:49.391 --> 04:51.437
Mr. Monk, he's not gonna get that.

04:51.472 --> 04:55.336
Um, an advisor,
sort of an adjunct.

04:55.371 --> 04:58.516
Monk, I don't know what an adjunct is.

04:58.551 --> 05:00.902
Monk. Monk.

05:00.937 --> 05:03.306
Look, I'd...I'd like to
take him for a little walk,

05:03.341 --> 05:05.700
see where he goes.
Maybe he'll retrace his steps.

05:05.735 --> 05:08.537
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

05:08.572 --> 05:12.747
Okay. Um, would you like to go for a walk?

05:12.782 --> 05:15.423
Oh.

05:15.458 --> 05:19.707
Monk.

05:19.742 --> 05:22.974
Monk. Monk.

05:23.009 --> 05:25.138
He won't stop saying "Monk".

05:39.039 --> 05:41.756
Where did you find that finger?

05:41.791 --> 05:43.735
Was it over there?

05:44.735 --> 05:46.798
Was it over here?

05:50.121 --> 05:53.010
- This way.
- This way? - Yeah.

05:53.045 --> 05:54.867
Are you sure?

05:54.902 --> 05:58.836
Looks like Monk finally found a friend.

05:58.871 --> 06:03.160
Her name was Trudy,
and she was 34 years old.

06:03.195 --> 06:06.201
We never found the killer.

06:06.236 --> 06:08.860
We had a lead in New York last year,

06:08.895 --> 06:12.861
but so far it's pretty much a dead end.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.472
Ooh. Careful.

06:26.211 --> 06:28.739
Oh. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

06:28.774 --> 06:30.574
Tommy, don't...
don't put that in your mouth. No.

06:30.609 --> 06:32.767
See? That is nature.

06:32.802 --> 06:36.398
See. We never put that in our mouth.
Nature is dirty. See?

06:36.433 --> 06:40.430
Nature dirty. Nature dirty.

06:40.465 --> 06:43.115
Here, look. Here.

06:50.866 --> 06:53.879
Okay. Now look,
I'm gonna give you,

06:53.914 --> 06:58.078
I'm gonna give you an extra wipe,
you keep it in your pocket for later.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.931
You-You'll need that later. Here.

06:59.966 --> 07:03.234
Put it... Put it right in your pocket
and keep it for later.

07:03.269 --> 07:05.743
Okay. Let's go.

07:05.778 --> 07:08.643
- Nature dirty.
- That's what I'm saying.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.289
And he wouldn't let go.
Did you see him?

07:11.324 --> 07:12.959
Yes, Monk. We saw him.
We were there.

07:12.994 --> 07:16.145
I mean, every time
I tried to say goodbye

07:16.180 --> 07:18.235
he-he just hugged me tighter,

07:18.270 --> 07:20.576
even tighter.
He had the most perfect little hands.

07:20.611 --> 07:23.041
Did you notice his... his perfect hands?

07:23.076 --> 07:25.482
- Yes, Mr. Monk. He liked you.
- You think so?

07:25.517 --> 07:27.492
Yes. He kept on saying
your name over and over, didn't he?

07:27.527 --> 07:30.215
- "Monk, Monk, Monk."
- Yeah, he did.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.480
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

07:31.515 --> 07:32.536
Yes, sir.

07:32.571 --> 07:38.868
It is a left pinkie belonging to
a male Caucasian about 25 years old.

07:38.903 --> 07:41.499
So far there's no match on the fingerprint.

07:41.534 --> 07:44.804
The digit was severed earlier today.
We figure about 8:00 a. m.,

07:44.839 --> 07:48.049
with some kind of gardening instrument,
like pruning shears.

07:48.084 --> 07:49.985
They cut up a whole body
with pruning shears?

07:50.020 --> 07:52.068
No. Maybe they just cut off the fingers.

07:52.103 --> 07:56.465
That way, when they dumped the body later,
there'd be no prints.

08:00.726 --> 08:03.053
There's a callus.

08:03.088 --> 08:06.001
That's true. We think
he might have played guitar.

08:07.388 --> 08:09.184
No. Not guitar.

08:16.949 --> 08:20.418
It's at the wrong angle.

08:20.453 --> 08:23.096
He played the violin.

08:23.131 --> 08:25.048
There's some residue.

08:26.545 --> 08:28.873
It's sticky, like sap.

08:28.908 --> 08:31.443
Tree sap, lumberjack.

08:31.478 --> 08:34.217
A missing nine-fingered lumberjack.

08:34.251 --> 08:36.856
- Who plays the violin.
- Should I put a list together?

08:36.890 --> 08:39.636
Absolutely.
Make sure you don't run out of paper.

08:39.672 --> 08:41.775
- Right.
- It's not tree sap.

08:41.811 --> 08:44.964
We already ran it.
The main component is abietic acid.

08:44.999 --> 08:47.896
Abietic acid?
That's violin rosin.

08:47.931 --> 08:51.314
I think that's pretty expensive rosin.
It's for professionals.

08:51.349 --> 08:56.516
So professional,
or at least very serious violinist...

08:56.551 --> 09:00.420
- Yeah.
- 25 years of age, who is missing.

09:00.455 --> 09:02.170
You wanna speak with my son?

09:02.205 --> 09:05.700
Yes. Ma'am,
we've been talking to musicians

09:05.735 --> 09:12.069
all day and we understand that Daniel
plays violin for the Bay City Quintet.

09:12.104 --> 09:14.995
Yes, that's right.
In his spare time.

09:15.030 --> 09:18.695
According to your son's employer,
he called in sick this morning.

09:18.730 --> 09:22.262
He got home very late last night,
and he was tired.

09:22.297 --> 09:24.065
Is he home, Mrs. Carlyle?

09:24.100 --> 09:26.616
- Mother?
- Daniel.

09:26.651 --> 09:28.923
Is something wrong?

09:28.958 --> 09:31.168
These people are with the police.

09:31.203 --> 09:32.813
They want to talk with you.

09:32.848 --> 09:35.479
Can you ask them to come back?
I'm rehearsing right now.

09:35.514 --> 09:37.497
Daniel Carlyle?

09:37.532 --> 09:39.085
That's right.

09:39.120 --> 09:43.010
Could I see your other hand?

09:45.785 --> 09:48.762
I have a concert tonight,
if you don't mind.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.110
Sorry to bother you, Mr. Carlyle.

09:51.145 --> 09:54.329
Have a nice day, ma'am.

09:56.490 --> 09:59.290
Oh, that was number eight.
He was the last one on our list.

09:59.325 --> 10:03.942
- I wonder if the Captain's doing any
better? - No. I'm sure he would've called.

10:03.977 --> 10:06.453
Maybe I should talk to that boy again.

10:06.488 --> 10:08.314
You mean Tommy?
He's two years old.

10:08.349 --> 10:12.106
- He won't be able to tell you anything.
- I don't know. He found the finger.

10:12.141 --> 10:14.819
Maybe if I spend some
more time with him.

10:14.854 --> 10:17.648
You miss him, don't you?

10:17.683 --> 10:19.673
We're going bye-bye now.
Here we go.

10:19.708 --> 10:21.988
I-It wasn't my fault.
The kid walked away for ten minutes.

10:22.023 --> 10:24.826
- I mean, it could happen to anybody.
- It's not my decision, Janet.

10:24.861 --> 10:27.824
When an incident like this happens
we always remove the child

10:27.859 --> 10:29.904
until the agency
can review the situation.

10:29.939 --> 10:31.933
The kid found a pinkie.
It's no big deal.

10:31.968 --> 10:36.285
It might be an indication you
and Raymond are overtaxed here.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.692
I mean, you already have
four foster children.

10:38.727 --> 10:40.625
Yeah. But we're doing
the very best we can, Mrs. Crane.

10:40.660 --> 10:42.121
I know you are, Janet.

10:42.156 --> 10:45.744
Why don't you call my office in the morning,
and we'll see where we stand. Okay?

10:45.779 --> 10:48.821
Say good-bye. Here we go.

10:50.582 --> 10:51.677
May I help you?

10:51.712 --> 10:53.454
Hi, I'm Natalie Teeger.
This is Adrian Monk.

10:53.489 --> 10:55.928
And we're working with
the police on the investigation.

10:55.963 --> 10:58.375
- About the severed...
- Yeah. Right, Mrs...

10:58.410 --> 11:00.991
Crane, Theresa Crane.
I'm Tommy's case worker.

11:01.026 --> 11:02.435
Monk.

11:03.301 --> 11:04.838
I see you two have met before.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.876
- What happens to him now?
- It's a tough one.

11:06.911 --> 11:09.331
I've been trying to place him
with a family in Livingston.

11:09.366 --> 11:12.334
It'd be a perfect match,
but they can't take him for two weeks.

11:12.369 --> 11:13.851
I'll take him.

11:13.886 --> 11:17.590
What? What are you going to do?
Adopt him?

11:17.625 --> 11:21.081
I'll take him.
I'll take him.

11:21.116 --> 11:22.878
Monk.

11:27.185 --> 11:30.240
Uh, this is the last form.
Just sign here.

11:40.518 --> 11:43.504
It doesn't have to be perfect.

11:47.037 --> 11:51.258
- Maybe it does.
- Thank you.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.097
Normally I would prefer
a longer waiting period.

11:53.132 --> 11:54.981
But because you and Tommy
have already bonded

11:55.016 --> 12:01.207
and it's just a temporary placement,
I decided to go with my instincts.

12:01.242 --> 12:04.378
There we go.

12:04.413 --> 12:07.659
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

12:07.694 --> 12:11.950
Now, before I go,
do you have any questions for me?

12:11.985 --> 12:14.798
Yes. Yes, I have a couple of questions.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.954
What does he eat?

12:19.989 --> 12:23.468
He eats food.

12:26.982 --> 12:30.798
He eats whatever you eat,
only smaller portions.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.473
So he's like a person?

12:32.508 --> 12:35.520
Exactly.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.672
And when he wakes up...

12:37.707 --> 12:39.327
Yes?

12:39.362 --> 12:40.804
What do I do?

12:40.839 --> 12:44.491
You... You take care of him.
You play with him.

12:44.526 --> 12:46.493
You love him.

12:48.257 --> 12:51.207
How? How?
How do I love him?

12:51.242 --> 12:53.235
Mr. Monk, you don't
need me to tell you that.

12:53.270 --> 12:57.304
You're off to a great start with Tommy.

12:57.339 --> 13:00.145
He likes you already, a lot.

13:00.180 --> 13:04.134
You can always call your friend, Natalie.
I think she's great. Oh.

13:04.169 --> 13:07.403
I'll check in tomorrow
and see how you're doin'.

13:08.573 --> 13:10.242
Wait. One sec, wait a minute.

13:10.277 --> 13:14.677
Wait. You're... You're leaving?
You're leaving now? Wait. Right now?

13:14.712 --> 13:18.479
You'll be fine.
Just trust yourself.

13:18.514 --> 13:21.423
Bye, Tommy. Have fun.

13:21.458 --> 13:25.649
Well, thank you.
Thanks. Thanks again.

13:33.950 --> 13:35.540
No, no, Tommy, don't cry.

13:35.575 --> 13:40.095
I promise I'm going to do the best I can.

13:40.130 --> 13:42.289
It's okay.
Don't cry. Don't cry.

13:42.324 --> 13:44.263
Everything is okay.

14:08.411 --> 14:10.172
Ah.

14:18.295 --> 14:20.890
Where'd he go?
Where'd that kid go?

14:20.925 --> 14:24.524
- Yes, nice and neat.
- Nice neat.

14:24.559 --> 14:26.440
Nice and neat.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.917
911 emergency.

14:36.952 --> 14:38.496
You've got to help me.

14:38.531 --> 14:41.154
Uh, look, I've just taken in
a two-year-old boy.

14:41.189 --> 14:45.712
My, uh, assistant isn't home
and I can't... I can't reach her.

14:45.747 --> 14:49.900
Oh. Oh, God. Oh.

14:49.935 --> 14:52.009
Sir, what is the nature of your emergency?

14:52.044 --> 14:55.372
It's everywhere.
BM. It's BM.

14:55.407 --> 14:57.706
BM. BM. It's BM.

14:57.741 --> 15:02.019
Sir, you have to stop saying BM now. Do
you mean your child is soiling his diaper?

15:02.054 --> 15:07.168
Yes. Yes, he's soiling his...
his diaper with, you know, with BM.

15:07.203 --> 15:09.018
You mean you've never changed a diaper?

15:09.053 --> 15:12.029
- Hurry.
- Okay, listen carefully.

15:12.064 --> 15:14.460
There should be
two Velcro straps on the sides.

15:14.495 --> 15:18.438
- Find the two straps.
- Okay, I've got the straps.

15:18.473 --> 15:19.977
Now rip 'em open.

15:20.012 --> 15:26.416
Oh! Oh, oh, oh! Oh!
Oh, my God.

15:26.451 --> 15:28.523
Oh, the humanity.

15:28.558 --> 15:31.994
Okay, sir? All right,
do you have any wipes?

15:32.029 --> 15:35.063
Yes, I've got about 2,000.

15:35.098 --> 15:38.128
- That should be fine.
- It's not going to be enough!

15:38.163 --> 15:42.362
Sir, you're gonna have to
wipe your son's bottom.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.762
Sir, is the boy all right?

15:46.797 --> 15:49.259
He's fine. That was me.

15:49.294 --> 15:52.320
Wait a minute.

15:52.355 --> 15:55.106
Oh, my God.
He's making more.

15:55.141 --> 15:56.786
I-Is it number one or number two?

15:56.821 --> 16:00.275
It's one and two and... and,

16:00.310 --> 16:02.957
oh, my God.
It's... It's three.

16:02.992 --> 16:05.307
It's number three.

16:05.342 --> 16:09.355
Sir, I'm afraid you're on your own.
This line is for emergencies only.

16:14.903 --> 16:19.486
That's right, children.
That was the piano.

16:26.758 --> 16:30.316
And that instrument was the violin.

16:30.351 --> 16:34.562
Now let's listen to the
piano and the violin.

16:50.798 --> 16:53.730
- Are you sure he's okay?
- Oh, yeah. He's fine.

16:53.765 --> 16:56.040
Mr. Monk, why is he wearing a snow suit?

16:56.075 --> 16:59.050
It was... Felt a little chilly. That's all.

16:59.085 --> 17:00.730
There was a little nip in the air.

17:00.765 --> 17:03.622
Oh, my gosh, he's sweating.
There we go.

17:03.657 --> 17:06.373
- He is?
- There you go.

17:06.407 --> 17:09.393
Okay. That's better, huh?

17:09.428 --> 17:10.893
So what are we doing here?

17:10.928 --> 17:13.740
Do you remember the guy
we met the other day, Daniel Carlyle?

17:13.775 --> 17:16.925
Well, that wasn't the real Daniel Carlyle.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.953
That guy wasn't a violinist at all.

17:18.988 --> 17:21.006
- He wasn't?
- Mmm-mmm.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.808
I remembered something.

17:22.843 --> 17:25.825
He said that we interrupted
his rehearsal, remember?

17:25.859 --> 17:27.099
Hmm.

17:27.135 --> 17:30.066
But the violin bow in his hand was loose,

17:30.101 --> 17:32.338
so he couldn't have been playing.

17:32.373 --> 17:37.127
Plus I went to the library this morning
and I found this. Look.

17:37.162 --> 17:39.481
Bay City Quintet.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.527
That's the group that
Daniel Carlyle plays with.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.794
And he said that he had
a concert that night.

17:45.829 --> 17:47.721
But there's nothing on the schedule.

17:47.756 --> 17:50.141
The bow was loose?

17:53.430 --> 17:55.687
I think we met his brother.

17:57.517 --> 17:59.651
But why would they be lying?

17:59.686 --> 18:02.381
I don't know. Maybe...

18:07.137 --> 18:12.328
Maybe the real Daniel Carlyle is dead.

18:12.363 --> 18:16.021
And the mother and brother killed him.

18:16.056 --> 18:18.477
No, I can't believe that.

18:18.512 --> 18:21.274
Wouldn't be the first time.

18:21.309 --> 18:25.946
- Maybe we should call Stottlemeyer.
- Yeah, I will as soon as I'm sure.

18:27.214 --> 18:30.391
Oh, my God.
What is this?

18:30.426 --> 18:33.346
- Why is he wearing a helmet?
- It's to protect his head.

18:33.381 --> 18:34.881
That must be so uncomfortable.

18:34.916 --> 18:37.927
Oh, he'll get used to it.
I used to wear one all the time.

18:37.962 --> 18:41.180
Your parents made you wear a helmet?

18:41.215 --> 18:42.718
No.

18:43.698 --> 18:46.160
There they are.
There they are.

18:48.798 --> 18:50.743
Here we go.

18:56.847 --> 19:00.282
It's been 20 minutes.
What do you think they're doing?

19:00.317 --> 19:02.815
I don't know.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.170
They're waiting for somebody.

19:05.205 --> 19:07.257
Here you go.

19:07.292 --> 19:09.439
- How's everything here?
- Perfect, thank you.

19:09.474 --> 19:11.975
But can we get some
more napkins, please?

19:12.010 --> 19:14.309
Mr. Monk,
can I ask you something?

19:14.344 --> 19:16.790
Why did you take Tommy in?

19:19.879 --> 19:24.540
I... I... I... Well, he needed me,
and I... I... I... I thought,

19:26.346 --> 19:30.430
I thought someday, you know,

19:32.608 --> 19:37.897
I thought somehow,
maybe he would...

19:39.495 --> 19:41.989
Love you?

19:45.076 --> 19:47.083
Oh, my gosh, look.

19:47.118 --> 19:49.556
He's separating his food.

19:49.591 --> 19:52.135
Me separating food.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.920
Mr. Monk, look, look, look, look.

20:16.526 --> 20:19.812
Natalie, I know what's going on.

20:19.847 --> 20:21.879
I had it all wrong.

20:25.129 --> 20:29.897
They didn't kill Daniel.
Daniel's not dead.

20:29.932 --> 20:32.477
He's been kidnapped.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.300
How did you know?

20:40.335 --> 20:41.767
We followed you.

20:41.802 --> 20:44.157
We saw you at the pay phone,

20:44.192 --> 20:48.804
and then we saw you go to the bank
and make a withdrawal.

20:48.839 --> 20:51.612
- You must be Daniel's brother?
- Jacob.

20:51.647 --> 20:55.067
Mrs. Carlyle, when did they
kidnap your son?

20:55.102 --> 20:57.110
Wednesday.

20:58.017 --> 20:59.925
Feels like a year ago.

20:59.960 --> 21:04.638
They cut off his finger to prove
that they had him and, uh,

21:04.673 --> 21:06.483
when we went to retrieve it

21:06.518 --> 21:10.057
at the park it was all roped off,
and there were police everywhere.

21:10.092 --> 21:14.564
Yes, a young boy found his finger
before you got there.

21:14.599 --> 21:17.057
That's what led us to you.

21:17.092 --> 21:19.349
You found us from his finger?

21:19.384 --> 21:23.361
- What are their demands?
- $500,000.

21:23.396 --> 21:25.608
And they said that if we went to the police

21:27.483 --> 21:29.226
they would kill Daniel.

21:29.261 --> 21:31.590
That's why we couldn't tell you the truth.

21:33.958 --> 21:36.818
I'm sorry,
I... I just can't stop shaking.

21:36.853 --> 21:38.804
Huh, I can't... I'm sorry.

21:38.839 --> 21:43.620
Mr. Monk?
You have to promise me one thing.

21:43.655 --> 21:46.725
You won't tell the police.

21:46.760 --> 21:50.323
If you do they'll kill him.

21:50.358 --> 21:52.983
I don't know if I can promise you that.

21:53.018 --> 21:54.785
Do you have children?

21:54.820 --> 21:56.734
Yes, I have a son.

21:58.761 --> 22:01.110
Well, then you know how I feel.

22:03.150 --> 22:05.718
Wouldn't you do anything for him?

22:08.221 --> 22:10.477
Wouldn't you die for him?

22:13.642 --> 22:17.765
Yes, I would.

22:27.265 --> 22:29.788
Hello?

22:31.557 --> 22:35.490
We have the money.
I understand.

22:38.408 --> 22:40.387
30 minutes?

22:41.523 --> 22:45.341
Yes, my son Jacob will bring it.

22:45.376 --> 22:46.823
He'll be alone.

22:46.858 --> 22:52.446
Is Danny all right? Is he hurt?

22:52.481 --> 22:54.977
Could I just speak to him for one...

22:55.012 --> 22:57.673
Please, I just...

23:09.443 --> 23:14.978
They want you to, uh,
go to the YMCA on Vinton Street,

23:15.013 --> 23:20.487
and you'll find locker 42 there,
and inside there'll be a note.

23:22.274 --> 23:26.195
I can't do it.

23:26.230 --> 23:31.428
I'm... I'm gonna mess it up.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

23:31.463 --> 23:33.794
It's all right.

23:33.829 --> 23:37.353
- I'll do it.
- Mrs. Carlyle, you can't go.

23:37.388 --> 23:39.269
They're expecting a man.

23:39.304 --> 23:40.984
She's right.

23:42.714 --> 23:45.692
We'll have to find a man.

23:48.957 --> 23:50.535
Or...

23:50.570 --> 23:53.860
or I could do it.

24:15.399 --> 24:17.190
Sorry.

24:49.891 --> 24:52.979
- Carlyle, have you got the money?
- Yes.

24:53.014 --> 24:56.060
Listen carefully.
Take the money from the duffel bag

24:56.095 --> 25:01.082
put it in the trash bag,
then get undressed. - Excuse me?

25:01.117 --> 25:05.040
There's a bathrobe. Put it on
and go up to the roof.

25:05.075 --> 25:07.135
You'll see a man on the next rooftop.

25:07.170 --> 25:09.453
Throw him the bag.
Do you understand?

25:09.488 --> 25:13.630
H-H-Hold on.
Did you say get undressed?

25:13.665 --> 25:17.724
Well, we have to be sure
you're not wearing a tracking device.

25:17.759 --> 25:23.102
Okay, here's the thing,
what if I promise you

25:23.137 --> 25:29.374
I am not wearing a tracking device?
What if I give you my word?

25:29.409 --> 25:31.324
You think this is funny?

25:31.359 --> 25:34.295
Do it, or your kid brother
loses another finger.

25:34.330 --> 25:37.516
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

25:37.551 --> 25:38.981
Here's the thing.

25:39.016 --> 25:41.277
Uh, here... here...
here's the thing.

25:41.312 --> 25:45.108
Uh, I'm just, uh,
I'm... I'm not comfortable here.

25:45.143 --> 25:47.135
Uh, I'm not...

25:47.170 --> 25:52.533
Even... Even in high school I...
I couldn't change in the locker room.

25:52.568 --> 25:55.155
I... I got an incomplete
almost every semester.

25:55.190 --> 25:57.518
I... I... I almost didn't graduate.

25:57.553 --> 26:01.574
Vice Principal Bradley
had to call my mother at one point.

26:01.609 --> 26:05.054
What are you talking about?
Are you trying to screw with us?

26:05.089 --> 26:05.781
Oh, no, no.

26:05.816 --> 26:09.231
Then get up on the roof in
a bathrobe with the money,

26:09.266 --> 26:11.995
or Daniel's dead.

26:43.347 --> 26:47.093
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Hi.

26:47.128 --> 26:49.607
- The rowing machine's broken again.
- Uh-oh.

26:49.642 --> 26:53.374
They don't fix anything around here.
They don't clean anything.

26:53.409 --> 26:55.105
I mean, what do we pay our dues for?

26:55.140 --> 26:59.520
- Am I right?
- Right. Right.

26:59.555 --> 27:02.210
Yeah. My membership's up next week.

27:02.245 --> 27:04.821
If they don't get their act
together, I'm not renewin'.

27:04.856 --> 27:06.696
I'll go to that new place up the street.

27:06.731 --> 27:08.923
- How about you?
- I don't know. I...

27:08.958 --> 27:13.304
Could you...
Could you do me a favor and go away?

27:13.339 --> 27:15.758
- What?
- Just for three minutes?

27:15.793 --> 27:18.771
Really, it's a matter of life and death.

27:18.806 --> 27:20.889
Yeah, right.

27:24.482 --> 27:27.302
- Ah. Oh.
- Oh, I'll get it, I'll get it.

27:27.337 --> 27:31.851
Oh, there you go.

27:31.886 --> 27:34.568
Thank you.
Yeah. Hello? Hello?

27:34.603 --> 27:36.331
Mr. Monk? Is Mom there?

27:36.366 --> 27:38.931
Julie, Julie, listen,
I... I... I took her phone.

27:38.966 --> 27:41.746
I... I had a couple of errands to run.

27:41.781 --> 27:43.973
- Is Tommy okay?
- He's fine.

27:44.008 --> 27:46.704
- He's... He's fine?
- Don't freak out, okay?

27:46.739 --> 27:49.117
I spilt a little grape juice on the rug.

27:49.152 --> 27:51.484
Listen very carefully.

27:51.519 --> 27:54.892
There are some cleaning
supplies in the hall closet.

27:54.927 --> 27:59.663
They're arranged alphabetically,
then by height, then by date of purchase.

27:59.698 --> 28:02.970
Find the rug cleaner,
then find a scouring pad,

28:03.005 --> 28:08.114
then find some distilled water,
Julie. Distilled water.

28:08.149 --> 28:11.841
Hold on a second.
There's another call.

28:11.876 --> 28:13.505
I'm waiting.
Where the hell are you?

28:13.540 --> 28:15.950
Some grape juice spilled.

28:15.985 --> 28:20.710
Well, you got three minutes,
or Daniel's dead.

28:20.745 --> 28:24.118
Julie, I'll call you back.

29:08.302 --> 29:10.155
- Hello?
- Mr. Monk?

29:10.190 --> 29:12.945
Everything is okay.
The stain is almost out.

29:12.980 --> 29:15.847
Thanks, Julie.
I... I appreciate that.

29:15.882 --> 29:18.832
Mr. Monk, you should see Tommy.
He's so cute.

29:18.867 --> 29:21.250
He's cleaning the stain all by himself.

29:21.285 --> 29:25.324
I can tell, when he grows up,
he's gonna be just like you.

29:25.359 --> 29:29.378
- Just like me?
- I'll see you when you get home.

29:33.488 --> 29:35.917
Hey.
Hey! Carlyle.

29:35.952 --> 29:38.095
Behind you. Hey!

29:39.188 --> 29:40.583
Hey!

29:40.618 --> 29:43.975
I'm throwing you the money, okay?

29:47.284 --> 29:49.658
Okay?

29:52.621 --> 29:54.078
Oh, yeah!

29:54.113 --> 29:57.636
Hey! Hey, what the hell are you doin'?

29:59.531 --> 30:04.024
All right, so what, you... you... you threw
the ransom money to the wrong man?

30:04.059 --> 30:05.646
That's right.

30:06.111 --> 30:11.114
- Does that happen a lot?
- Oh yeah, more than you'd think.

30:11.149 --> 30:13.733
Really?

30:13.768 --> 30:16.102
No, okay? Okay, no.

30:16.137 --> 30:18.965
It's... It's unprecedented.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.326
All right, so... so,
what... what happens now?

30:21.361 --> 30:24.893
Mrs. Carlyle gave me permission
to call the Captain in.

30:24.928 --> 30:27.551
He recovered the ransom money.

30:27.586 --> 30:31.371
The kidnappers called back
two hours later, thank God,

30:31.406 --> 30:33.601
And they're gonna set up another drop.

30:33.636 --> 30:36.280
A-A-Adrian, what...
what happened on that roof?

30:36.315 --> 30:39.294
A mistake like that,
that's not like you.

30:39.329 --> 30:42.787
I was distracted.
Natalie's daughter called.

30:42.822 --> 30:44.439
She was babysitting Tommy.

30:44.474 --> 30:47.310
- Wh-What... What did she say?
- I don't remember.

30:47.345 --> 30:51.537
Oh. I think you do.

30:54.784 --> 30:56.466
All right.

30:56.501 --> 31:01.038
She spilled some juice,
and Tommy was helping to clean it up.

31:01.073 --> 31:06.901
It's funny. She said
that Tommy was just like me.

31:06.936 --> 31:08.824
And that...
And that upset you?

31:08.859 --> 31:12.483
No. No, I was flattered.

31:12.518 --> 31:18.342
Actually, I've been thinking
about calling the case worker

31:18.377 --> 31:21.166
and making it permanent.

31:21.201 --> 31:24.393
Well, that's a... That's
a pretty big commitment, Adrian.

31:24.428 --> 31:27.397
I mean, that's probably
the biggest commitment there is.

31:27.432 --> 31:30.574
Well, I figure he could do a lot worse
for a father than me.

31:30.609 --> 31:32.329
Am I right?

31:33.272 --> 31:35.475
- Absolutely.
- For example,

31:35.510 --> 31:37.729
what if he were adopted by

31:40.226 --> 31:43.655
uh, well, you know,

31:49.106 --> 31:51.076
wolves?

31:51.111 --> 31:53.495
Wolves would probably eat him alive.

31:53.530 --> 31:57.371
- Which is something I would never do.
- Right. No, of course not.

31:57.406 --> 32:00.899
Adrian, I know you don't
want to hear this.

32:00.934 --> 32:02.700
I'm not giving him up.

32:02.735 --> 32:09.534
I'm proud of you for taking Tommy.
I'm glad you did it. But...

32:09.569 --> 32:11.210
in your heart of hearts,
I think you know

32:11.245 --> 32:14.876
- you're not ready for this.
- I'm not giving him up.

32:16.659 --> 32:19.478
- Hello?
- Julie?

32:21.106 --> 32:24.390
Mom? Mr. Monk?
You have to see this. Come here.

32:24.425 --> 32:26.792
Hey.

32:45.886 --> 32:49.025
So what? What?

32:49.060 --> 32:52.156
So he's just like me.

32:52.191 --> 32:58.714
I... I think that's...
I... I... I think that's...

32:58.749 --> 33:00.360
I think that's okay.

33:00.395 --> 33:03.073
I'm tired of apologizing for him.
I'm... I'm...

33:03.108 --> 33:07.305
What, because he... he... he cares about
putting things away and... and how he looks?

33:07.340 --> 33:09.650
That's a good thing. - But Mr. Monk,
he's not even two years old.

33:09.685 --> 33:11.962
Well, then he's in the vanguard, isn't he?

33:11.997 --> 33:15.666
He's a new breed.
He's a new breed.

33:15.701 --> 33:19.479
Oh, my God.
What if it's true?

33:20.245 --> 33:22.619
Mr. Monk,
what... what did Dr. Kroger say?

33:22.654 --> 33:24.246
Dr. Kroger?

33:24.281 --> 33:26.100
Dr. Kroger is not perfect.

33:26.135 --> 33:28.752
Dr. Kroger makes mistakes all the time.

33:28.787 --> 33:32.165
Last year, he told me to start dating.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.485
Dating.

33:34.520 --> 33:37.564
Okay, you know what, just stop... Honey,
we've got to go. It's a school night.

33:45.309 --> 33:47.614
You know what? Wait. I... I...
I... Mr. Monk, I've just got

33:47.615 --> 33:49.996
to say something, and I hope
you don't think I'm out of line.

33:50.031 --> 33:54.124
But I'm a single parent,
and I can tell you it's hard.

33:54.159 --> 33:55.691
I mean, it's wonderful...

33:55.726 --> 34:00.390
It's just I hope you think about
what you're doing.

34:00.425 --> 34:03.461
Mmmuah. See you tomorrow.

34:03.496 --> 34:05.215
Just think about it.

34:09.790 --> 34:13.263
Book. Book.

34:13.297 --> 34:17.138
- You want me to read you a story?
- Yeah.

34:17.172 --> 34:19.719
Okay, here we go. Okay.

34:21.846 --> 34:24.887
Okay, what do we have here?

34:24.922 --> 34:26.978
Which one shall we read?

34:27.013 --> 34:29.264
This one?
Okay. Here we go.

34:29.300 --> 34:33.154
The Princess and the Pea.

34:33.188 --> 34:38.319
"Once upon a time,
in a magical kingdom...

34:38.353 --> 34:40.866
What? What is that?

34:40.900 --> 34:43.533
Tommy, what... what is that?

34:43.568 --> 34:47.645
- Lipstick.
- Lipstick.

34:47.679 --> 34:49.987
Where did you...
Did you...

34:50.023 --> 34:52.717
You got that from Natalie's purse?

34:52.752 --> 34:55.417
You took that out of Natalie's purse?

34:56.617 --> 34:59.482
Um, no.

35:18.174 --> 35:21.284
Capt. Stottlemeyer, please.

35:21.319 --> 35:22.924
What? Could you...

35:22.959 --> 35:25.657
Could you have him call Adrian Monk
as soon as possible?

35:25.692 --> 35:27.970
Tell him it's very important.

35:28.005 --> 35:29.192
Yes.

35:29.227 --> 35:34.015
Tell him I think I know
who kidnapped Daniel Carlyle.

35:34.050 --> 35:36.371
Thank you.

35:39.644 --> 35:43.765
Okay. Shall we read another story?

35:43.800 --> 35:50.206
- Um, yeah.
- Okay, here we go.

35:50.241 --> 35:56.303
"Once upon a time
in a kingdom called San Francisco,"

35:56.338 --> 35:59.889
"there lived a brave little prince."

35:59.924 --> 36:04.476
"And his name was Tommy Grazer."

36:04.511 --> 36:07.700
"Tommy lived with
a wicked king and queen."

36:07.735 --> 36:10.104
"The queen was very greedy."

36:10.139 --> 36:14.752
"She loved gold,
and she wanted more and more."

36:18.205 --> 36:21.149
"The queen had a plan."

36:21.184 --> 36:25.700
"She would find a young fiddler
from a wealthy family"

36:25.735 --> 36:30.626
"and kidnap him and hold him for ransom.

36:30.661 --> 36:33.053
"They locked the fiddler in a dungeon."

36:33.088 --> 36:36.234
"The fiddler's family was very sad."

36:36.269 --> 36:40.850
"They would do anything to get him back."

36:40.885 --> 36:45.102
"The wicked king and queen
needed to prove that they were serious,"

36:45.137 --> 36:48.766
"so they chopped off the fiddler's finger"

36:48.801 --> 36:52.069
"and planned to leave it in the park."

36:53.590 --> 36:59.643
"But Prince Tommy was very brave
and very smart..."

36:59.678 --> 37:03.216
"He liked to reach into ladies' purses."

37:03.251 --> 37:10.038
"He reached into the queen's purse
and he grabbed the finger."

37:10.073 --> 37:13.259
That's where you found it, isn't it?

37:13.294 --> 37:15.218
Yeah.

37:18.644 --> 37:24.116
"Then Tommy made a new friend
named Mr. Monk."

37:24.151 --> 37:28.304
"Mr. Monk remembered something that
the wicked queen said:"

37:28.339 --> 37:30.827
"The kid found a pinkie.
It's no big deal."

37:30.862 --> 37:35.468
"How did she know
the missing finger was a pinkie?"

37:35.503 --> 37:40.413
"The police never
released that information."

37:49.946 --> 37:56.095
And then, the most wonderful
and surprising thing of all happened.

37:58.257 --> 38:06.187
Mr. Monk discovered
that he loved that little prince.

38:12.624 --> 38:19.451
But he also realized
that the little prince could never live

38:19.486 --> 38:24.853
happily ever after
if he stayed at Mr. Monk's house,

38:29.164 --> 38:34.457
because Mr. Monk can
barely take care of himself.

38:36.146 --> 38:43.967
And so, they're gonna
have to say good-bye.

38:55.547 --> 38:57.871
The end.

39:15.679 --> 39:19.490
Surveillance says there are four kids
in the back, watching TV.

39:19.525 --> 39:20.874
Where's Mom and Dad?

39:20.909 --> 39:23.768
In the kitchen havin' a drink.

39:23.803 --> 39:25.660
Hit it.

39:28.455 --> 39:30.830
Police. On the floor.
Hands behind your head.

39:30.865 --> 39:33.275
Entry team, move out.

39:36.094 --> 39:38.052
We're clear.

39:46.956 --> 39:49.277
Hold back.

39:53.981 --> 39:56.549
Hey.

40:05.286 --> 40:06.966
Move in.

40:12.158 --> 40:13.785
Dan.

40:45.487 --> 40:48.609
Here.

40:50.441 --> 40:52.681
See?

40:59.976 --> 41:02.199
Wait.

41:02.234 --> 41:06.610
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Hey, wait.

41:06.645 --> 41:12.674
I got you. I got you.

41:14.836 --> 41:16.713
Hey.

41:24.117 --> 41:26.541
Yeah.

41:26.576 --> 41:27.944
Hello.

41:27.979 --> 41:29.357
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:29.392 --> 41:32.096
This is the couple I told you about.
This is Hank and Lisa Murphy.

41:32.131 --> 41:33.582
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:33.617 --> 41:37.466
Let him get dirty.
Kids should get dirty.

41:37.501 --> 41:39.463
We will.

41:39.498 --> 41:40.925
Okay.

41:42.055 --> 41:45.612
Okay, then.
Goodbye.

41:55.699 --> 41:58.156
Okay.

41:59.522 --> 42:03.380
I want kisses, too.

42:03.415 --> 42:07.241
He's so cute.
He's so cute.

42:07.276 --> 42:10.604
He's so cute.

42:19.807 --> 42:21.923
Bye.
