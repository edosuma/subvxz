11:11.040 --> 11:14.840
Following that evaluation,
some space station components

11:14.840 --> 11:17.280
could be detached
and jettisoned.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.840
-(ALL GASP)
-Neb, do you think so?

11:18.840 --> 11:21.000
Please, please, please!
If that occurs,

11:21.480 --> 11:24.040
certain personnel might be
reassigned to Earth,

11:24.040 --> 11:26.720
But any speculation
in that direction is...

11:26.720 --> 11:28.000
-It's premature.
-MAN: Why are they even

11:28.000 --> 11:29.680
-coming up at all?
-WOMAN: Yeah, what do they want?

11:29.680 --> 11:30.880
As near as I can understand it,

11:31.440 --> 11:33.920
there's concern that some
sectors of our station

11:33.920 --> 11:36.920
are deteriorating at a rate
rapid enough

11:36.920 --> 11:39.160
to pose a threat to the
remainder of the base.

11:39.160 --> 11:42.000
Are they considering shutting us
down altogether?

11:42.000 --> 11:44.560
To the best of my limited
knowledge, absolutely not.

11:44.560 --> 11:47.920
Look, the most prudent thing
we can all do is relax.

11:47.920 --> 11:48.840
-(ALL GROAN)
-What?

11:49.240 --> 11:51.440
-Relax. Right.
-PLANK: I know it's hard,

11:51.440 --> 11:55.120
but we're professionals,
and if we can just wait
for General Hammond to arrive,

11:55.120 --> 11:57.880
-I think everything will be
explained to you.
-(ALL GROAN)

11:58.760 --> 11:59.880
Mom, Dad...

12:14.880 --> 12:18.040
Zenon, I know your mother has
an incredible fear of flying

12:18.040 --> 12:19.240
and an even more
acute fear of Earth,

12:19.240 --> 12:23.320
but any decisions
regarding who stays
and who goes won't be up to me.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.000
But you're gonna have some kind
of opinion, right?

12:25.000 --> 12:26.160
These military guys
can't judge us.

12:26.160 --> 12:27.160
They don't even know us.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.360
General Hammond and his team
have arrived
in the transport lounge.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.880
The first words
out of his mouth were

12:31.880 --> 12:33.000
he wants to see you ASAP.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.920
All right, have him report
to my office.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.960
Actually, sir,
I was addressing Zenon.

12:45.400 --> 12:48.160
Whenever I have a vital,
formidable mission to assign,

12:48.160 --> 12:51.040
I look for the best man
or young woman

12:51.040 --> 12:52.160
for the job.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.720

for this assignment,

12:53.720 --> 12:56.080

13:01.880 --> 13:03.680
Whatever you need,
I'm your girl.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.320
It's not often someone my age
gets to serve her country

13:06.320 --> 13:08.520
under the command
of such a noble...

13:08.520 --> 13:10.200

13:10.640 --> 13:12.080
You request it, I'm in.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.760

13:14.760 --> 13:18.840
I need you to be responsible
for the care and comfort

13:18.840 --> 13:21.080

13:39.960 --> 13:41.200

13:45.680 --> 13:46.960
Margie girl.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.720
Welcome. Since you've had
a long, grueling flight,

13:50.720 --> 13:51.960
I want you to get to
your quarters

13:51.960 --> 13:53.760
and take a nap
until evening mess.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.680
But, Daddy, why?
I'm not in the least bit tired.

13:58.160 --> 14:01.560

14:27.960 --> 14:31.600
Look, Margie,
if your dad wants me
to baby-sit you,

14:31.600 --> 14:33.720
Fine, I will baby-sit you,

14:33.720 --> 14:36.480
but up here, you are on my turf.

14:36.480 --> 14:40.120
Says who? If Daddy's
the commander of your ship...

14:40.120 --> 14:43.840
And let's face it, I've got
Daddy totally wrapped...

14:44.680 --> 14:48.400
Wouldn't you sort of say
that puts me in charge?

14:51.880 --> 14:54.880
How Fabulo would this look
on me? Can I borrow it?

14:54.880 --> 14:55.960
No!

15:04.480 --> 15:07.240
You fully love living up here in
space, right?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.280
So?

15:09.280 --> 15:12.560
So, if you're not
mondo nice to me,

15:12.560 --> 15:15.680
I'll tell Daddy
I don't think you Kars deserve
to stay on this station.

15:15.680 --> 15:18.120
Cetus-lupeedus, you think
Your father's gonna reassign us

15:18.120 --> 15:19.840
just because you tell him to?

15:21.600 --> 15:22.640

15:23.680 --> 15:26.120
Uh, no, that's okay.

about to start

25:25.360 --> 25:28.760

like med students on a cadaver.

25:28.760 --> 25:30.080

25:30.080 --> 25:32.800
Dad, why do they jettison
modules, anyway?

25:32.800 --> 25:36.120
As far as I can figure, Wyndham
and Lutz's sabotage effort

25:36.120 --> 25:37.960
knocked our station out
of its intended orbit.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.400
If any of the older,
more vulnerable components

25:40.400 --> 25:41.800
push us farther out of whack,

25:41.800 --> 25:44.280
our entire base could come
crashing down to Earth.

25:44.280 --> 25:46.080
Swell. Going to Earth
the normal way

25:46.080 --> 25:47.080

-about crashing down.

25:58.040 --> 26:00.480
I don't know,

26:01.760 --> 26:04.360
those are the most terrifying

26:33.600 --> 26:35.560

back on Earth.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.000

26:41.680 --> 26:44.200
I could marry Judy.
I could get a normal job.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.040
I wouldn't have to be in charge
of anything for a while.

talking, Commander Plank.

Your aliens.
I think they're half the reason

26:55.040 --> 26:56.480

with this.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.480

another planet

36:53.600 --> 36:56.800
And nobody wants to believe me,
even though I know the aliens
are real,

36:56.800 --> 36:59.560
because not only did they signal
me twice in the AP Lab,

36:59.560 --> 37:02.920
but who else could contact
my zap-pad
after I fully shut it down?

37:02.920 --> 37:08.160
Oh, it's aliens.
Of course, it's aliens.
It was only a matter of time.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.760
Do you seriously believe that?

37:10.760 --> 37:15.280
As sure as I believe my name is
Judy Kling,
which I do... most days.

37:16.760 --> 37:19.400
I mean, how could there
not be other life

37:19.400 --> 37:20.880
out in the endless expanse?

37:20.880 --> 37:22.800
What are we,
a planet of egomaniacs?

37:23.240 --> 37:27.480
I have believed in aliens since
I was your age,
even younger, doll-face.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.720
They're out there, all right.

37:29.720 --> 37:31.600

grown-up ever?

37:37.240 --> 37:39.680
So, will you help us?
Please?

37:39.680 --> 37:40.760
With a mission
this tricky major,

37:40.760 --> 37:43.040
we can use all the support
we can get.

37:44.840 --> 37:45.960
-Okay.
-Yes!

37:47.120 --> 37:48.320
Let's think.

37:48.320 --> 37:50.320
No one's seen Proto Zoa
in months.

37:50.320 --> 37:51.800
His own manager's been
on the flat-screen

37:51.800 --> 37:53.520
saying he has no idea
where he is.

37:54.520 --> 37:57.440
What if the aliens aren't trying
to find Proto Zoa.

37:57.440 --> 38:00.200
-What if they have him?
-(GASPS)

38:00.200 --> 38:02.600
-Excuse me?
-You know, what if they did some
kind of a...

38:02.600 --> 38:04.040
Like an alien abduction,

38:04.040 --> 38:05.600
and now they're just trying to
bring him back.

38:05.600 --> 38:08.640
Do you seriously think a UFO
could swoop down,

38:08.640 --> 38:10.760
swipe up one of the most
mega-famous guys on the planet,

38:10.760 --> 38:13.960
and then zoom away without
anyone seeing them?

38:13.960 --> 38:15.320
Negatory, Marge.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.080
(SIGHS) No...

38:18.080 --> 38:19.360
He's here.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.880
He's just in recluse mode
extreme.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.640
All right, Miss Never-Wrong-
About-Anything,

38:26.240 --> 38:29.120
If his own friends
and family can't find him,
how will we?

38:29.560 --> 38:31.520
How else do you find a missing
rock star?

38:31.520 --> 38:33.160
Study his lyrics.

38:33.640 --> 38:36.520
Yeah, and this would help...
how?

38:36.520 --> 38:38.520
Great writers write about what
they know.

38:38.520 --> 38:40.720
And if it's a person or a place
they really love,

38:40.720 --> 38:42.640
it shows up in their stuff
all the time.

38:42.640 --> 38:44.160
Like, what's his greatest hit?

38:44.160 --> 38:45.480
AUNT JUDY: I know, I know!

38:45.480 --> 38:47.160
"Supernova Girl".

38:47.160 --> 38:48.720
Impressive major, Aunt Judy.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.000
There was also "Nova Nights",

38:51.000 --> 38:52.880
and "Perfect Dream"
had a line in it

38:52.880 --> 38:54.680
about "the nova of my heart".

38:55.600 --> 38:57.960
So, he's a nova freak.
What does that prove?

38:57.960 --> 39:01.120
Go with me here!
What else does he talk about
a lot?

39:01.600 --> 39:03.120
He always writes about love.

39:04.080 --> 39:07.080
Who doesn't, Margie?
Think specifics.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.400
Okay, doesn't he mention some
Linda girl in a ton of songs?

39:10.400 --> 39:13.240
Cetus-lupeedus, Margie!
You're a genius major!

39:13.240 --> 39:14.400
So, what else is new?

39:15.760 --> 39:16.800
What'd I say this time?

39:19.160 --> 39:20.320
(ZEEPAD BEEPS)

39:20.320 --> 39:23.160
Aunt Judy, doesn't "Linda" mean
something in Spanish?

39:23.160 --> 39:25.160
"Beautiful."
I'm pretty sure.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.280
Linda... Nova...
Nova Linda, hmm.

39:28.720 --> 39:31.280

-This is it! This is it!

PROTO ZOA: (BRITISH ACCENT)
As my manager, Les,

39:39.440 --> 39:41.640
you should understand better
than anybody

39:41.640 --> 39:44.640
that someone as undeniably
fantastic as me

39:44.640 --> 39:48.120
should be doing only undeniably
fantastic things.

39:48.120 --> 39:51.960
So, after being the first rock
legend in outer space,
what's left?

39:53.240 --> 39:56.440
What's next?
Well, I can't run for president.

39:56.440 --> 39:59.520
You got a silly rule
about having to actually
be born in America.

39:59.520 --> 40:03.200
And the pope's out.
I heard that you have to
actually be a Catholic.

40:03.600 --> 40:08.080
So, you see my dilemma, Lester?
If I can't find new heights
to hit,

40:08.080 --> 40:11.560
then I'd just rather be
a Havana Cabana boy
than be a burnout, sellout,

40:11.560 --> 40:14.920
was-once-isn't-now, but still
fabulous-looking rock star.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.320
I am definitely gonna be thrown
out of adulthood

40:38.320 --> 40:40.280
for letting you two go off alone
like this.

40:40.280 --> 40:43.080
Worry down, Aunt Judy.
We're gonna be fine.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.640
We've a map, a compass,
bug repellent major...

40:45.640 --> 40:48.360
Plus, I was a Galaxy Scout
for a few years.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.200
I normally took one of Daddy's
soldiers along

40:50.200 --> 40:52.200
to help me do
all the yucky stuff.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.960
But we're older now and wiser
and fully ready
to handle anything.

40:56.440 --> 40:57.360

icky little

41:31.600 --> 41:34.480
And what would you
like me to do, Margie,
carry you?

41:36.960 --> 41:39.160
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.200

the line.

stop dead,

from General Hammond.

49:03.040 --> 49:05.240
You and Mrs. Kar
are under house arrest.

49:05.240 --> 49:06.480
-We're what?
-What?

49:06.480 --> 49:08.280
Until your daughter returns
with Hammond's daughter,

49:08.280 --> 49:09.920
you two are to remain confined
to your quarters.

49:09.920 --> 49:13.320
We have to get down to our lab.
We have some very important
experiments in progress.

49:13.320 --> 49:14.640
I am sorry, sir.

49:14.640 --> 49:15.840
My orders were quite clear.

49:15.840 --> 49:17.280
You are not permitted to leave
these premises

49:17.280 --> 49:19.520
under any circumstances until
notified otherwise.

49:20.200 --> 49:22.000
-(DOOR BEEPING)
-No, wait, I...

49:23.240 --> 49:25.080
-(GUITAR TWANGS)
-PROTO ZOA: Ha-ho!

49:25.360 --> 49:29.520
Zenon! Zenon, I'm writing.
I'm actually writing.

49:29.960 --> 49:32.000
I haven't been able to scribble
down a single note

49:32.000 --> 49:33.960
since I fell into my funk.

49:34.760 --> 49:36.560
Mondo-glad to be of service.
Here.

49:38.560 --> 49:40.080
It's like my mom says,

49:40.080 --> 49:42.040
no fuel in the belly,
no fire in the brain.

49:43.800 --> 49:45.440
What? I'm new at this.

49:45.960 --> 49:48.120
Gemma usually does
all the cooking in space.

49:48.120 --> 49:50.200
(LAUGHS WEAKLY)
Who'd have guessed?

49:51.440 --> 49:53.120
Uh, you know what, love,
though...

49:53.120 --> 49:55.080
there is something
I'm a little bit curious about.

49:55.080 --> 49:57.440
If your aliens were so fixated
on meeting me,

49:57.440 --> 50:00.360
why didn't they just beam down
to Nova Linda and look me up?

50:01.400 --> 50:03.920
Maybe they saw that last-century
movie chip, <i>E.T.</i>

50:03.920 --> 50:04.880
She speaks.

50:06.040 --> 50:09.880
Yeah, and as soon as they land,
creepy government official guys
with lots of keys

50:09.880 --> 50:11.840
would try to catch 'em
and experiment on 'em,

50:11.840 --> 50:13.520
or attack them
and blow them up!

50:13.520 --> 50:14.960
MARGIE:
Or lock them up in alien zoo.

50:15.840 --> 50:18.960
Now, meeting us in space...
much safer.

50:18.960 --> 50:21.640
Well, then, that brings me
onto another huge question.

50:22.080 --> 50:25.320
Uh... Outer space
is a pretty enormous expanse,

50:25.320 --> 50:26.520
if I recall.

50:26.520 --> 50:29.840
How are we
supposed to have any idea
where to hook up with them?

50:31.840 --> 50:33.440
-(ZAP-PAD BEEPS)
-AUTOMATED VOICE: <i>Access denied.</i>

50:35.760 --> 50:38.400
Right after they sent the first
message directly to me,

50:38.400 --> 50:41.840
Orion said he suspected
they also downloaded
all kinds of information,

50:41.840 --> 50:43.960
but I haven't figured out
how to get it.

50:43.960 --> 50:45.440

50:54.680 --> 50:56.600

<i>Orion.</i>

50:56.600 --> 50:57.800
<i>I just don't know</i>
<i>how to read it.</i>

50:57.800 --> 50:59.240
Okay, can you upload it to me?

50:59.240 --> 51:00.320
<i>-I can try.</i>
-You do that.

51:00.320 --> 51:03.200
I'll see if I can match any
of their coordinates to ours.
I'll get back to you ASAP.

51:03.200 --> 51:04.720
<i>Great. You're the best.</i>

51:04.720 --> 51:05.880
(CONSOLE BEEPS)

51:06.880 --> 51:09.600
Oh, man... contact.

51:10.880 --> 51:12.880
(CHUCKLES) How does she do it?

51:12.880 --> 51:15.600
You have to, Margie.
That's all there is to it.
You have to.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.000
You expect me to call Daddy,

51:18.000 --> 51:21.920
ask him to send us a shuttle
to fly into oblivion
to go meet aliens?

51:21.920 --> 51:23.320
He'll blow a gasket!

51:23.840 --> 51:26.880
I'm sure he's already dying
to toss you in the brig
after kidnapping me.

51:26.880 --> 51:27.880
Kidnapping you?

51:27.880 --> 51:29.320
MARGIE: Well,
I had to tell him something.

51:29.320 --> 51:31.160
He would have gotten
all red-faced mad at me

51:31.160 --> 51:33.480
if he thought I'd flown off
just to have an adventure.

51:33.480 --> 51:36.560
Oh, so once again,
I'm the expendable one.

51:37.360 --> 51:38.240
Exactly.

51:38.640 --> 51:41.640
But I thought you had him
oh-so-totally-wrapped.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.360
About some things.

51:43.360 --> 51:46.480
Look, you fully have to convince
him to let us use the shuttle.

51:46.480 --> 51:47.840
End of story.

51:47.840 --> 51:49.320
The aliens are waiting, Margie,

51:49.320 --> 51:51.760
and if we can show the world
that our Spay-Stay's responsible

51:51.760 --> 51:53.120
for contacting other life forms,

51:53.120 --> 51:56.400
then maybe they'll stop tearing
it apart and leave us alone.

51:58.360 --> 52:00.640
Come on, Marge, you can do it.
I know you can.

52:01.400 --> 52:03.720
No, no.
That's where you're wrong.

52:03.720 --> 52:06.000
Technology and I
have never gotten along.

52:06.000 --> 52:08.640
All I'm asking you to do
is call your father.

52:08.640 --> 52:09.960
That's it.

52:09.960 --> 52:12.200
Proto Zoa and I
will be right here
rooting for you.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.160
(ZAP-PAD BEEPS)

52:30.320 --> 52:31.760
<i>The true nature</i>

Hello, Daddy?

52:37.320 --> 52:38.520
Daddy?

52:38.520 --> 52:40.400
<i>As soon as we've relocated</i>

52:40.400 --> 52:42.400
<i>to Earth</i>
<i>by the end of next week,</i>

52:42.400 --> 52:44.440
<i>we will jettison</i>
<i>the remaining sectors.</i>

52:44.440 --> 52:46.240
<i>All that will be left</i>

52:46.240 --> 52:48.800

<i>the old girl is definite, sir?</i>

52:48.800 --> 52:50.480
<i>Oh, whatever</i>
<i>Wyndham and Lutz did</i>

52:50.480 --> 52:53.200
has caused this craft
to drift so far out of orbit

52:53.200 --> 52:57.040
that the natural decomposition
process has increased tenfold.

52:57.920 --> 53:01.640
Ah, if we don't act, Hart,
this entire base could drop
out of the sky

53:01.640 --> 53:03.320
like Dorothy's farmhouse.

53:05.120 --> 53:08.360
Bottom line...
this tub is history.

53:09.200 --> 53:11.520
-How did you tap into this?
-How should I know?

53:11.520 --> 53:13.680
I told you I'm the master
of disaster at all this.

53:13.680 --> 53:15.360
I could hear him.
He just couldn't hear me.

53:15.360 --> 53:16.320
Can you believe this?

53:16.320 --> 53:18.880
They're not up there to unload
a few sectors of my Spay-Stay.

53:19.240 --> 53:21.200
They're going to dismantle
the whole thing!

53:21.200 --> 53:24.240
I'm telling you what Zenon
heard Hammond telling Hart.

53:24.240 --> 53:26.360
If we don't jump in
and do something drastic,

53:26.360 --> 53:29.680
your entire space station is
going to be history, and soon.

53:29.680 --> 53:30.920
<i>All right, look...</i>

53:31.320 --> 53:33.240
<i>Suppose I could rustle up</i>
<i>a shuttle,</i>

53:33.240 --> 53:36.000
<i>and suppose, just for a minute,</i>
<i>that I was insane enough</i>

53:36.000 --> 53:39.280
<i>to take off after a pack of</i>
<i>Proto Zoa-loving aliens.</i>

53:39.800 --> 53:41.520
Exactly how am I supposed to
know where to go?

53:41.520 --> 53:45.600
<i>Are you ready for this one?</i>
<i>The aliens sent Zenon a map.</i>

53:45.600 --> 53:46.920
-They what?
<i>-It's true!</i>

53:46.920 --> 53:48.440
<i>She uploaded it to Orion.</i>

53:48.440 --> 53:50.240
<i>No one down here</i>
<i>knew how to read it,</i>

53:50.240 --> 53:52.600
but we're hoping that he'll have
the skills and the tools

53:52.600 --> 53:53.600
to decipher it.

53:53.600 --> 53:55.280
(LAUGHS) <i>Judy?</i>

53:56.000 --> 54:00.400
<i>Sweetheart...</i>
<i>do you have the slightest idea</i>
<i>how crazy this sounds?</i>

54:00.400 --> 54:03.600
Sure, I do, but life is crazy.
(CHUCKLES)

54:04.080 --> 54:05.560
Especially life with Zenon.

54:05.560 --> 54:09.680
<i>Still, Edward,</i>
<i>you have to admit that she has</i>
<i>this uncanny ability</i>

54:09.680 --> 54:11.240
<i>to be right about these things.</i>

54:13.600 --> 54:16.080
ORION: Once I got this scale
figured out,

54:16.080 --> 54:18.320
I simply used their benchmark
symbols of the Earth and Moon

54:18.320 --> 54:20.000
to calibrate
their distance units.

54:20.000 --> 54:23.000
Then I replotted those locations

54:23.000 --> 54:24.800
to our standard issue
navigational chart.

54:25.800 --> 54:29.040
Look, I mean this is amazing,
sir. It's all lined up.

54:29.040 --> 54:32.520
In all candor, Orion,
do you believe this map
is legitimate?

54:32.960 --> 54:34.640
ORION: Look, sir,
if you get on a shuttle

54:34.640 --> 54:37.640
And you fly out to the location
indicated here,

54:38.280 --> 54:39.600
in my hardly humble opinion,

54:39.600 --> 54:41.440
you are going to find yourself
face to face

54:41.440 --> 54:42.720
with extraterrestrials.

55:00.480 --> 55:02.080
ZENON: (SIGHS) There you are.

55:02.600 --> 55:05.200
Did you talk to Plank?
Did he get the shuttle?
Is he coming?

55:05.200 --> 55:07.840
-No word yet.
-Oh, 'cause I was thinking...

55:09.360 --> 55:11.400
What am I doing?
If I confide in you,

55:11.400 --> 55:14.400
you'll sooner or later find some
way to use it against me.

55:16.040 --> 55:17.280
Why do you hate me?

55:19.240 --> 55:20.880
What are you talking about?

55:20.880 --> 55:23.200
You're the one that hates me,
remember?

55:23.200 --> 55:26.360
You've been mean and sarcastic
to me since the last time
I was on Earth.

55:26.960 --> 55:29.720
Oh, that. Don't you know
that's just how I am?

55:29.720 --> 55:32.200
You're fully ridiculous to take
it personally.

55:32.200 --> 55:34.160
People do take it personally.

55:34.160 --> 55:36.640
No one wants to be made fun of
or picked on.

55:37.840 --> 55:40.840
Wait, are you actually saying
people listen to me?

55:42.920 --> 55:48.000
(SIGHS) Okay. My dad's been in
the military my whole life.

55:48.000 --> 55:51.640
Do you know how many times
we've moved,
how many schools I've gone to?

55:52.520 --> 55:55.280
And every time, it's like
macro-hard to start over.

55:56.440 --> 55:58.600
I'm... I mean...

56:01.120 --> 56:02.600
I don't try to be a jerk.

56:04.080 --> 56:05.080
(SIGHS)

56:05.960 --> 56:07.400
I just don't know how to fit in.

56:08.240 --> 56:12.240
Unlike you,
who pops in anywhere and...
instant popularity extreme.

56:12.240 --> 56:16.880
Yeah, but I always wind up with
everyone looking to me
for fun, adventure, and answers.

56:17.360 --> 56:21.200
Like now.
What if I'm wrong about this
whole alien thing?

56:21.200 --> 56:24.000
What if I get Plank into a lot
of trouble for taking that
shuttle?

56:24.000 --> 56:26.560
I've already got my parents
under house arrest.

56:26.560 --> 56:29.200
My mom is burning through one
stress helmet after another,

56:29.200 --> 56:31.760
fully blowing an O-ring about
relocating to Earth, and...

56:33.240 --> 56:35.680
everybody's got pressures in
their life, Margie.

56:36.640 --> 56:38.640
If you wanna make some
real friends,

56:38.640 --> 56:41.800
start by learning you're not the
only person in the galaxy with
problems.

56:43.960 --> 56:46.360
I know it's a huge adjustment,
honey,

56:46.360 --> 56:48.920
but couldn't you try to find
something to smile about?

56:48.920 --> 56:51.240
Like what?
I've seen pictures of prisons

56:51.240 --> 56:53.280
that weren't as depressing as
this apartment.

56:53.280 --> 56:56.480
We're only here until we get our
whole job situation sorted out.

56:57.360 --> 57:00.280
Why don't you try to go outside
today, explore a little?

57:00.280 --> 57:02.400
(SCOFFS)
Every time I step out that door,

57:02.400 --> 57:04.920
there's either a hover car or an
Ohm-cycle

57:04.920 --> 57:07.080
or a Wham-board
trying to run me over.

57:07.080 --> 57:09.880
The air is inky brown.
The food tastes like plastic.

57:09.880 --> 57:11.200
I want to go home.

57:11.720 --> 57:12.880
Don't we all.

57:13.560 --> 57:16.200
But, since that's currently not
an option,

57:16.200 --> 57:18.080
you might as well give this
place a chance.

57:18.080 --> 57:19.760
It can be quite lovely if you're
open to it.

57:19.760 --> 57:23.200
Most of the people are
incredibly warm and welcoming.

57:23.200 --> 57:24.880
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

57:30.000 --> 57:32.200
Hello, ma'am. Is this the home
of Nebula Wade?

57:32.200 --> 57:33.320
Yes. Who are you?

57:33.840 --> 57:37.960
Captain Rand Wills,
United States
Intergalactic Patrol.

57:37.960 --> 57:39.640
I was dispatched by
General Hammond.

57:39.640 --> 57:42.600
-To do what?
-To interview your daughter
and find out what she knows

57:42.600 --> 57:45.120
about the current whereabouts of
Zenon Kar.

57:53.760 --> 57:54.920
(DOOR LOCK BEEPS)

57:55.440 --> 57:57.800
Excuse me for interrupting,
General.
Do you have a minute?

57:57.800 --> 58:00.600
Oh, please, come in. Um...

58:00.600 --> 58:04.880
(CHUCKLES)
I have, uh... Well, I have
a slightly embarrassing

58:04.880 --> 58:07.760
personal favor to ask you, sir.
My girlfriend down on Earth

58:07.760 --> 58:10.080
has really been nagging me to
visit her,

58:10.080 --> 58:13.160
and truth be told,
I've been missing her terribly.

58:14.160 --> 58:18.040
Would you permit me
to pilot the departing transport
shuttle this evening?

58:18.040 --> 58:23.000
I deliver our returning crew
members, spend a brief
24 hours with Judy,

58:23.000 --> 58:25.040
and be back up here
by midday Monday.

58:25.480 --> 58:27.240
If you can spare me,
that is, sir.

58:29.200 --> 58:31.400
I don't see why that couldn't
work, Commander.

58:31.400 --> 58:33.520
Thank you.
Thank you very much, General.

58:33.520 --> 58:36.760
I can't tell you how much I...
we appreciate this. Thank you.

58:39.840 --> 58:42.240
Thank you. Thank you.

58:44.960 --> 58:47.280
I don't think
I can impress upon you

58:47.280 --> 58:50.520
how imperative it is that
we find Miss Kar

58:50.520 --> 58:54.120
as soon as possible.
Listen, I told you everything
I know.

58:54.120 --> 58:55.840
She came down here to find
Proto Zoa.

58:56.720 --> 58:59.120
Would this be a reference to
the renowned rock musician

58:59.120 --> 59:00.880
who's been absent from public
view of late?

59:00.880 --> 59:01.960
That's the guy.

59:03.120 --> 59:06.120
Precisely how did Miss Kar
intend to discover
his whereabouts?

59:06.600 --> 59:09.920
Mister, Zenon and I have been
friends our whole lives,

59:09.920 --> 59:13.040
and I'm still way clear minor on
how she does anything.

59:16.840 --> 59:18.640
ZENON: That's amazing,
Aunt Judy!

59:18.640 --> 59:21.320
He's coming down?
He is actually coming down?

59:21.320 --> 59:22.520
How'd you pull it off,
Aunt Jude?

59:22.520 --> 59:23.880
That's a miracle major!

59:26.280 --> 59:27.720
before he'd even talk to
Hammond,

59:27.720 --> 59:29.680
Edward made me agree
to brave my fears

59:29.680 --> 59:31.920
and come back with you guys
for a visit in space.

59:31.920 --> 59:33.480
Did you hear that?
Aunt Judy did it!

59:33.480 --> 59:36.480
We got a shuttle. Plank's going
to pilot us to meet the aliens.

59:36.480 --> 59:38.080
Where are we hooking up
with him?

59:38.080 --> 59:40.360

<i>get there as soon as possible,</i>

59:40.360 --> 59:41.840
but make sure that you stay
out of sight.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.720
Why? What's up?

59:44.720 --> 59:47.680
Well, Nebula called to say that
Hammond has a patrol down here
searching for you,

59:47.680 --> 59:50.560
checking anywhere and everywhere
that you guys might be.

59:50.560 --> 59:53.280
Oh, stellar. Have they shown up
at your place yet?

59:53.280 --> 59:56.080

<i>a matter of time.</i>

It's really happening!

anybody's here.

envy-green I am.

1:00:38.680 --> 1:00:40.800
I mean, this is the real deal,

1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:43.880
This is the trip I have spent my
whole life cogitating about.

1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:46.560
I mean, you're actually getting
to meet extraterrestrials.

1:00:46.560 --> 1:00:48.640
Yes. Well, I'm still
very skep...

1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:51.600

this whole thing, Orion.

You don't want to be rocketin'
off to meet the aliens

1:00:57.760 --> 1:00:59.240
without your
navigational charts.

1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:00.560
PLANK: Thank you, Orion.

1:01:00.560 --> 1:01:01.880
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate...

1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:04.320
All your help.

Now, before your Helihover
arrives,

1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:18.080
I have to ask you one thing:

1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:20.800
you do know you're only gonna be
in space a few days, right?

1:01:21.280 --> 1:01:23.680
I've seen luggage stores with
less luggage.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:27.040
Let me remind you, ladies,
that staying as fabulous-looking
as I am

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:28.800

1:01:30.360 --> 1:01:31.440
to detail.

1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:33.760
This is ridiculous.

1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:35.960
Hammond won't even take my
zap-pad calls anymore.

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:38.640
How long do you think he's gonna
keep us locked up in here?

1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:41.000
Not one minute after Zee
and Margie get back.

1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:42.880
Do you really think plank is
going to get away

1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:44.480
with flying them out to find
the aliens?

1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:47.400
Ah... actually, folks,

1:01:47.400 --> 1:01:48.920

Cetus-lupeedus, Aunt Judy,
what happened to you?

1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:03.280
You have no idea
what a rush it is
to ditch a couple of G-men.

1:02:03.280 --> 1:02:05.960
My poor heart is pounding faster
than a hummingbird's.

1:02:07.720 --> 1:02:10.000
-Have we heard from Zenon yet?
-They're back
from Nova Linda cove,

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.440
-and they're headed
for Carlson Beach.
-Oh, great.

1:02:11.440 --> 1:02:15.080
Before we go, would you
mind terribly if maybe I
washed up a little bit?

1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:16.360
-(CHUCKLES)
-Of course not. Come on.

1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:28.120
<i>your mother and I</i>
<i>are starting to think</i>

1:02:28.120 --> 1:02:30.240
<i>that maybe you ought to</i>

1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:31.400
<i>and come home.</i>

1:02:31.400 --> 1:02:34.800
And fully forget about
the aliens? We can't!

1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:37.600
What if they're in some kind of
trouble out there in east
Nothingsville?

1:02:37.600 --> 1:02:40.200
What if that's why they
contacted us in the first place?

1:02:40.200 --> 1:02:42.240
<i>Zee, listen to us.</i>

1:02:42.240 --> 1:02:43.920
<i>There comes a time when we have</i>
<i>to be practical.</i>

1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:47.720
<i>Now, the bottom-line reality is</i>
<i>plank is the only one</i>
<i>on our side</i>

1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:49.320
<i>who has the ability to fly</i>
<i>a shuttle.</i>

1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:52.000
Actually, Daddy, I think you're
forgetting something.

1:02:55.400 --> 1:02:57.720
I... I... I can't.

1:02:57.720 --> 1:03:01.040
Mike, I... I... I can't. I...

1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:04.240
And it's not a question
of not wanting to.
It's just... it's simply...

1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:06.080
It's just... I can't.

1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:07.600
All right, then don't.

1:03:07.600 --> 1:03:10.000
But Zee and her aliens?

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:13.200
You have to admit,
it would be thrilling,
not to mention historical.

1:03:13.720 --> 1:03:15.200
Why couldn't you be the pilot
in the family?

1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:17.680
I mean, you'd go out there
in a heartbeat, wouldn't ya?

1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:20.520
When did I turn into such
a big fat chicken?

1:03:21.400 --> 1:03:24.640
I used to love flying.
I loved adventure.

1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:26.400
Zenon doesn't get it all
from you, you know.

1:03:26.400 --> 1:03:30.200
-I do know.
You were a wild woman.
-So, what happened?

1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:33.120
We had a kid.
Suddenly, the stakes changed.

1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:36.280
But she wants me to do it.
She wants me to do this more
than anyone.

1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:37.480
Sure, she does, honey,

1:03:38.120 --> 1:03:41.320
but in the end, the only one who
can make the decision...

1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:42.240
is you.

1:03:54.800 --> 1:03:57.560
We followed Zenon's directions
exactly, right?

1:03:58.240 --> 1:04:01.040
-So, where are they?
-Worry down, Aunt Judy.

1:04:01.520 --> 1:04:03.080
I'm sure they'll be here
any minute.

1:04:06.360 --> 1:04:09.040
Are you sure you know where
you're going, Orion?

1:04:09.040 --> 1:04:10.160
Look, trust me.

1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:12.880
I studied the ship's
navigational charts a hundred
times.

1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:16.240
What?

1:04:17.800 --> 1:04:20.000
-It's this way.
-You sure?

1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:24.720
I really don't think I'm capable
of flying a shuttle
at this point, Orion.

1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:27.400
Look, I'm tellin' you, Mrs. K.,
it's fine.
You won't have to.

1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:29.760
What? What do you mean?

1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:31.000
With Hammond's men on high
alert,

1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:32.960
we are never gonna get a shuttle
outta here.

1:04:32.960 --> 1:04:34.320
-Ow.
-Um...

1:04:34.320 --> 1:04:39.280
So you are going
to be flying...

Hi. Hi, honey.

1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:13.080
Oh, how did Edward ever pick
this spot to land?

1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:16.240
Cetus-lupeedus, Aunt Judy,
no one's told you yet?

1:05:16.240 --> 1:05:17.720
Told me what? What happened?

1:05:18.280 --> 1:05:20.680
Okay, no reason to go into
meltdown mode,

1:05:20.680 --> 1:05:23.480
but plank got caught with
the navigational charts,

1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:25.280
Hammond threw him
into military jail,

1:05:25.280 --> 1:05:26.600
Hammond's going on
the mega warpath,

1:05:26.600 --> 1:05:30.040
and if I'm wrong about this
whole alien thing,
it could be disaster extreme.

1:05:30.040 --> 1:05:34.240
But sweat minor, Aunt Judy,
'cause I'm fully sure
everything's gonna be just fine.

1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:37.840

the ship, who is?

Look, just relax, Okay?

1:05:51.360 --> 1:05:54.080
I mean, except for nearly
clipping the research tower on
takeoff,

1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:55.920
you've been doin' just fine.

1:05:55.920 --> 1:06:00.000
You don't understand.
The only thing more terrifying
to me than taking off

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:04.400
is landing.
I, uh, I really don't think
I can do it.

1:06:05.840 --> 1:06:09.040
Look, I don't want to be
unsupportive or anything,
Mrs. K,

1:06:09.040 --> 1:06:12.040
but maybe you should have
thought of that
before we took off.

be to find?

<i>It's harder than we thought,</i>
<i>sir.</i>

1:06:20.120 --> 1:06:23.560

be easier if you open your eyes?

-Come on, Mom. We can do this.

-MAN 2:<i> Roger that.</i>

1:09:08.080 --> 1:09:11.120

1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:17.920

You can do it.

1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:24.880
(ALL SCREAMING)

1:09:49.600 --> 1:09:50.600
It's your wife...

1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:54.000
and your girlfriend...

1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:58.080
And your daughter
and my daughter
and Orion and a rock star?

1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:02.320
Just to be clear, sir,
Zenon's pal Nebula is also on
board, sir.

1:10:02.320 --> 1:10:07.960
Do you even have an inkling
of what deep trouble
you're all in?

1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:13.080
Flying an unauthorized mission
across the universe chasing
phantoms?

1:10:13.640 --> 1:10:16.480
Actually, sir, they've had an
ongoing signal from these...

1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:20.880
phantoms, who are apparently in
some sort of distress.

1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:23.200
That is nonsense, Commander!

1:10:23.200 --> 1:10:27.040
-It's treason!
-And since it's also a very
risky and brave endeavor,

1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:30.200
And since we all have people we
love on that ship,

1:10:30.760 --> 1:10:33.640
sir, maybe instead of assigning
blame and punishment,

1:10:33.640 --> 1:10:36.800
we ought to focus on a way of
helping them achieve a safe
return.

1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:37.760
Sir?

1:10:56.680 --> 1:10:59.840
I don't get it, Mom.
We're exactly where
we're supposed to be,

1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:01.280
according to Orion's charts,
right?

1:11:02.480 --> 1:11:04.320
Well, if the aliens are there,

1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:06.280
then why aren't they here?

1:11:06.280 --> 1:11:09.520
Well, the trouble is converting
their measurements to ours,

1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:11.360
doesn't mean the calculations
were precise.

1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:14.280
I mean, even a variance of a few
degrees on paper

1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:17.520
could mean thousands of miles
out here in space.

1:11:17.520 --> 1:11:19.360
We are gonna find them,
aren't we?

1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:22.080
I mean, we'll just fly around
out here until they show up?

1:11:22.080 --> 1:11:23.520
We can't do that forever, Zee.

1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:27.360
We have a finite fuel supply,
limited provisions.

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:30.400
It's okay. They're gonna
be here. I know it.

1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:32.560
I have a feeling major
in my bones.

1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:35.200
Whatever ends up happening
out here,

1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:37.920
-thank you.
-For what?

1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:40.560
Shaking me out of my cocoon,

1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:42.960
getting me to fly again,
be out here with you.

1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:47.040
Honey, you've shown me that it's
fine to want to live a safe
and sane life,

1:11:47.040 --> 1:11:48.640
but sometimes
we can get so safe,

1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:51.240
(SIGHS) you practically
stop living.

1:11:52.400 --> 1:11:53.880
Cetus-lupeedus, I did all that?

1:11:53.880 --> 1:11:56.600
(LAUGHS) Yeah. All that
and more, believe me.

1:11:57.480 --> 1:12:00.640
You know, when you're growing up
and thinking about someday
having kids of your own,

1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:05.400
you spend lots of time imagining
all the things you want to show
and teach them,

1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:07.240
all the ways you'll guide
and mold them.

1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:12.800
But I don't think anybody can
possibly anticipate
the thousands of things

1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:14.800
your children are going
to teach you.

1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:17.560

-We're running out of fuel
already?
-Oh, no. Don't worry.

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:26.440
Orion said that the auxiliary
tanks he put in

1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:28.000
are even larger
than the main tanks.

1:12:41.760 --> 1:12:43.680
Orion,
did everything appear normal

1:12:43.680 --> 1:12:45.360
when you refilled
the auxiliary tanks?

1:12:46.920 --> 1:12:48.320
You did refill them, didn't you?

1:13:00.040 --> 1:13:01.720
Can't we just call up
the space station

1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:03.440
and have them
send a rescue ship?

1:13:03.440 --> 1:13:04.760
Quickly. Quicker than quickly.

1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:06.520
I mean, I know they're not
exactly thrilled with us,

1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:08.720
but they can't want to leave us
up here to die.

1:13:08.720 --> 1:13:11.280
I tried calling,
but there must be a meteor
shower in progress,

1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:12.600
because all I got was static.

1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:14.280
Oh, of course.
Just our luck, right?

1:13:14.280 --> 1:13:15.640

Tell me one thing:
do I look half as hysterical as
I feel?

1:13:18.200 --> 1:13:20.360
What? More so than usual,
you mean, love?

1:13:20.360 --> 1:13:22.200
Uh, folks, we also have another
problem.

1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:26.080
Before anyone can reach us,
we're gonna get sucked into the
Moon's gravitational field.

1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:28.080
Is that bad? Uh, well...

1:13:28.080 --> 1:13:32.200
Not until our ship goes crashing
down to the surface and
explodes, no.

1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:33.200
Oh, that's bad.

1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:34.720
What are we gonna do, Mrs. Kar?

1:13:34.720 --> 1:13:36.560
Well, look, everyone,
first of all,

1:13:36.560 --> 1:13:38.000
should just... Stay calm.

1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:42.040
Are you sure? Because I am
really much better at panicking.

1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:44.000
Panicking I do very, very well.
Oh...

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:47.440
Oh, I have always known that
blasting into an endless void

1:13:47.440 --> 1:13:48.800
was bad for one's health.

1:13:48.800 --> 1:13:51.120
Oh, always!
So how did I end up here?

1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:53.200
I'm afraid that's my fault,
Aunt Judy.

1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:56.480
Cetus-lupeedus, how did I get us
mixed up in this crazy mess?

1:13:56.480 --> 1:13:58.200
Come on. Come on, folks.

to their planet as souvenirs?

1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:15.000

do we open the door?

Maybe they'll go right through
the door.

You know, what you all seem to
be missing
is, aliens or no aliens,

1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:08.160
and I'm still not convinced that
those little swirling lights

1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:10.200
you talked about truly were
alien beings.

1:20:10.920 --> 1:20:12.680
But the fact remains,
I was not sent up here

to be some
mustache-twirling villain.

1:20:14.240 --> 1:20:15.880

will continue.

And all your little escapade
has done

1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:39.520
is to put several people whom
you claim to love

1:20:39.520 --> 1:20:41.360
into life-threatening jeopardy!

1:20:41.360 --> 1:20:44.000

are you contradicting me?

1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:02.960
but you're wrong.
Zenon did find aliens,

1:21:02.960 --> 1:21:04.440
and they spoke to us
through her,

1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:06.920
and we gave them the
navigational stuff that
they needed,

1:21:06.920 --> 1:21:08.440
and they gave us a tow home,

1:21:08.440 --> 1:21:11.400
and the whole thing is so macro
that the world needs to know
about it.

1:21:12.120 --> 1:21:13.440
Proof, Margie.

1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:16.920
What no one here seems to be
offering is proof.

1:21:22.200 --> 1:21:23.280
What's happening?

1:21:23.280 --> 1:21:24.880
Are we falling out of orbit?

1:21:24.880 --> 1:21:27.800
Uh... Actually,
we're falling back into orbit.

1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:28.920
What is going on?

1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:30.480
Stellar.

1:23:13.400 --> 1:23:17.920
Well, as my pal Zenon Kar
can testify,

1:23:18.360 --> 1:23:21.760
when she so cleverly found me on
Nova Linda cove,

1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:23.200
I was a mess...

1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:27.560
Full of problems, lost,
confused,
hadn't written a song in a year.

1:23:27.960 --> 1:23:30.360
So, she told me
about these space aliens,

1:23:30.360 --> 1:23:32.800
and she told me that they
wanted to contact me.

1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:36.560
But guess what? The sad truth is
they didn't care one whit
about me.

1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:38.320
ALL: Aw!

1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:42.400
They picked up my transmission
of my concert in outer space

1:23:42.400 --> 1:23:45.440
and used that to contact a true
believer...

1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:46.760
Zenon.

1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:50.360
Oh, it was quite a humbling
experience, actually,

1:23:50.360 --> 1:23:52.040
but you know what?
It doesn't matter,

1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:54.880
because this episode has
revitalized me.

1:23:54.880 --> 1:23:57.680
So, what if I'm not the center
of the universe?

1:23:58.120 --> 1:24:01.320
I mean, look at me.
I wanted new challenges,
and I've gotten them.

1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:04.920
I'm even playing weddings now.

1:24:04.920 --> 1:24:06.600

1:24:06.600 --> 1:24:11.280

and Mrs. Edward Plank...

1:24:14.360 --> 1:24:16.360

inspiration,

1:24:17.960 --> 1:24:19.200

I thought your dad

him and Commander Plank

stick around,
