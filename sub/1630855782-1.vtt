a low-budget indie

would wind up

16:05.898 --> 16:06.999

fertility doctor

16:14.414 --> 16:16.251
-about your prospects.
-But he said that last time.

what I was going to say.

You were going to ask me
if it's hard for me

16:45.811 --> 16:48.750
to talk about your IVF journey
since mine didn't work.

But Dex persuaded me
to take a chance, and...

21:58.201 --> 22:00.172
We're almost sold out.
