01:34.177 --> 01:37.180
the house

01:37.222 --> 01:39.266
and where Dewey

01:37.222 --> 01:39.266
left his goldfish.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.309
Hal, would you put

01:39.307 --> 01:41.309
on a decent shirt?

01:41.351 --> 01:42.811
Stevie's here.

01:42.853 --> 01:43.854
So?

01:43.896 --> 01:45.188
So, I like having

01:43.896 --> 01:45.188
him around.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.316
Look, he's actually

01:45.230 --> 01:48.316
got the boys reading

01:45.230 --> 01:48.316
the newspaper.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.945
Wait.

01:50.986 --> 01:53.906
I haven't... finished yet.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.410
Hey, check it out--

01:58.452 --> 02:00.328
the county fair.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.747
Look at that--

02:00.370 --> 02:01.747
they got a roller coaster,

02:01.789 --> 02:03.498
a side show,

02:01.789 --> 02:03.498
knife throwers.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.459
Your name...

02:05.500 --> 02:07.628
written on... rice.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.255
Oh, man, this is

02:07.669 --> 02:10.255
the last weekend.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.423
We've got to go.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.258
Yeah, like Mom

02:11.465 --> 02:13.258
will ever let us go.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.510
Why does...

02:15.552 --> 02:18.680
she have... to know?

02:19.347 --> 02:21.516
You got an idea?

02:21.558 --> 02:24.561
Maybe... you guys...

02:24.603 --> 02:27.856
could come...

02:24.603 --> 02:27.856
for a sleepover.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.942
Your parents aren't going

02:27.898 --> 02:29.942
to let us go to the fair.

02:29.984 --> 02:33.570
They'll think...

02:29.984 --> 02:33.570
that I'm...

02:33.612 --> 02:36.448
sleeping...

02:33.612 --> 02:36.448
at  your  house.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.199
Double alibi.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.368
It's a classic

02:38.241 --> 02:40.368
for a reason.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.788
Can you...

02:40.410 --> 02:42.788
talk your mom...

02:42.830 --> 02:45.666
into...

02:42.830 --> 02:45.666
sleeping over?

02:45.707 --> 02:47.501
Mom, can we sleep over

02:45.707 --> 02:47.501
at Stevie's tonight?

02:47.542 --> 02:48.293
Sure!

02:48.335 --> 02:53.090
Now for... my parents.

02:53.132 --> 02:56.718
A sleepover?!

02:53.132 --> 02:56.718
At someone else's house?!

02:57.636 --> 02:59.554
Don't you like

02:57.636 --> 02:59.554
sleeping here, son?

02:59.596 --> 03:01.222
I don't think

02:59.596 --> 03:01.222
this is a good idea, Steve.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.225
I mean, Malcolm's

03:01.264 --> 03:04.225
family doesn't have a

03:01.264 --> 03:04.225
HEPA filter air purifier

03:04.267 --> 03:06.478
and God knows how outmoded

03:04.267 --> 03:06.478
their alarm system is.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.106
They probably don't even

03:06.520 --> 03:09.106
have motion detectors.

03:09.148 --> 03:10.315
Be honest, son.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.274
Is it my snoring?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.234
You have a

03:11.316 --> 03:13.234
perfectly good

03:13.276 --> 03:15.487
hypo-allergenic mattress

03:13.276 --> 03:15.487
here to sleep on.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.572
I just don't see the point.

03:17.614 --> 03:22.369
I would help... me feel...

03:22.410 --> 03:24.746
normal.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.837
Fish... in a barrel.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.005
All right.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.005
See you there.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.339
Stevie's in.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.339
We're all set.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.967
He's going to meet us

03:34.381 --> 03:36.967
at the bus stop in half an hour.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.426
We take the 37 express

03:37.009 --> 03:38.426
to the fair

03:38.468 --> 03:41.304
have fun for a little while,

03:38.468 --> 03:41.304
and we're back home by midnight.

03:51.690 --> 03:52.649
Everything.

03:52.691 --> 03:53.817
I want to go to the fair.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.777
No, Dewey.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.777
You're too young.

03:55.819 --> 03:58.279
Take me or I'll tell Mom.

03:58.321 --> 04:01.575
If you do, I'll just

03:58.321 --> 04:01.575
stomp the crap out of you.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.744
Go ahead.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.744
I'm still telling.

04:03.785 --> 04:06.872
Dewey, you're not going

04:03.785 --> 04:06.872
and you're not telling.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.751
If you blab to Mom, we'll take

04:06.914 --> 04:10.751
every pet you ever get

04:10.792 --> 04:12.627
and set it free.

04:12.669 --> 04:16.965
We'll destroy every toy,

04:12.669 --> 04:16.965
every game,

04:17.007 --> 04:19.467
everything you ever love.

04:19.509 --> 04:22.262
Do what you have to.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.224
Dewey's going to go

04:23.346 --> 04:25.224
with us to Stevie's.

04:25.265 --> 04:25.766
Why?

04:25.807 --> 04:27.601
Because we like him.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.644
I'm just fun.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.231
And Stevie's mom

04:29.686 --> 04:32.231
is okay with this?

04:29.686 --> 04:32.231
Yeah.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.857
Maybe so, but she has no idea

04:32.313 --> 04:33.857
what she's getting into

04:33.899 --> 04:35.316
with the three of you

04:33.899 --> 04:35.316

Uh, honey, Kitty can speak up

04:36.651 --> 04:38.070

04:38.112 --> 04:39.362
I mean, she's made a decision.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.489
I don't think we should

04:39.404 --> 04:41.489
be second-guessing her.

What?!

04:42.950 --> 04:44.325
Though with Dewey gone, too,

04:44.367 --> 04:46.327

04:44.367 --> 04:46.327
of something to do...

04:46.369 --> 04:49.414

07:34.537 --> 07:37.874
to be in the neighborhood.

07:37.916 --> 07:40.377
You just want to

07:37.916 --> 07:40.377
kiss him good night.

07:40.419 --> 07:41.586
So what if I do?

07:41.628 --> 07:44.505
I've kissed that boy good night

07:41.628 --> 07:44.505
every night since he was born.

07:44.547 --> 07:48.551
It makes him sleep better

07:44.547 --> 07:48.551
and it makes me sleep better.

07:48.593 --> 07:49.886
(sighs)

07:49.928 --> 07:52.597
What is taking so long?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.391
You know those boys--

07:54.433 --> 07:56.059
they're probably

07:54.433 --> 07:56.059
watching ninja movies

07:56.101 --> 07:57.518
and eating

07:56.101 --> 07:57.518
full-fat crackers.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.313
(loud crashing)

07:59.354 --> 08:00.855
Hello?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.899
Is everything okay in there?

08:02.941 --> 08:05.444
(muffled whispers)

08:07.528 --> 08:08.905
Oh.

08:08.947 --> 08:12.533
Kitty, Abe...

08:08.947 --> 08:12.533
uh, what are you doing here?

08:12.575 --> 08:13.660
Hello, Hal.

08:13.701 --> 08:15.996
Is everything okay?

08:13.701 --> 08:15.996
We heard a crash.

08:16.037 --> 08:17.205
Oh, yeah. Sure.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.707
We're just, um...

08:17.247 --> 08:19.707
moving furniture.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.251
So, what-what brings you by?

08:21.293 --> 08:23.544
We just came by

08:21.293 --> 08:23.544
to see Stevie.

08:23.586 --> 08:24.545
Stevie?!

08:24.587 --> 08:25.922
Stevie isn't here.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.341
I thought he was with you.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.509
What-What are you

08:27.382 --> 08:29.509
talking about?

08:29.550 --> 08:30.551
Where's my baby?

08:30.593 --> 08:33.263
Abe, Kitty,

08:30.593 --> 08:33.263
what-what are you doing here?

08:33.305 --> 08:34.555
We came to

08:33.305 --> 08:34.555
see Stevie.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.724
He's not here on

08:34.597 --> 08:36.724
a sleepover with

08:34.597 --> 08:36.724
your boys?

08:36.766 --> 08:38.726
No! They told us

08:36.766 --> 08:38.726
they were spending the night

08:38.768 --> 08:40.520
at your house

08:38.768 --> 08:40.520
for a sleepover.

08:41.604 --> 08:43.273
Oh...

08:44.607 --> 08:48.403
Hal, get my bra.

08:51.614 --> 08:54.659
I guess I should be scared,

08:51.614 --> 08:54.659
but I'm not.

08:58.872 --> 08:59.831
Fake blood.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.501
That's... a zombie?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.544
Rubber guts.

09:09.632 --> 09:12.719
Okay, if I had

09:09.632 --> 09:12.719
paid for this ride,

09:09.632 --> 09:12.719
I'd be really pissed.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.263
Stevie! Stevie!

09:15.305 --> 09:18.725
Stevie! Stevie! Stevie!

09:18.766 --> 09:20.060
Stevie!

09:20.101 --> 09:21.686
Stevie! Stevie!

09:21.728 --> 09:24.481
Kitty, you have to

09:21.728 --> 09:24.481
leave a little room

09:21.728 --> 09:24.481
between your "Stevies"

09:24.523 --> 09:26.191
or you won't be able

09:24.523 --> 09:26.191
to hear him yell back.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.360
I'm sorry.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.360
I'm just a little nervous.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.195
I don't have as much experience

09:30.237 --> 09:32.613
with my child

09:30.237 --> 09:32.613
being in mortal danger.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.865
Okay, just calm down.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.492
You have to focus on

09:33.907 --> 09:35.492
something positive...

09:35.534 --> 09:36.993
like how we're going

09:35.534 --> 09:36.993
to punish them.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.619
How can I focus on anything

09:38.661 --> 09:41.081
when Stevie's out there,

09:38.661 --> 09:41.081
lost and scared?

09:41.122 --> 09:42.790
I understand what

09:41.122 --> 09:42.790
you're feeling, Kitty.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.625
I'm concerned, too.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.625
We're all concerned.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.503
Abe, this van

09:44.667 --> 09:46.503
is a palace.

09:46.545 --> 09:49.339
What does a rig like this

09:46.545 --> 09:49.339
set you back?

09:49.381 --> 09:50.715
Eh, not as much

09:49.381 --> 09:50.715
as you'd think.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.801
When I sprang for

09:50.757 --> 09:53.801
the DVD player and

09:50.757 --> 09:53.801
flat-screen monitor,

09:53.843 --> 09:56.012
they threw in the GPS

09:53.843 --> 09:56.012
system for free,

09:56.054 --> 09:57.722
so it's really a...

09:59.849 --> 10:01.017
Stevie!

10:01.059 --> 10:03.728
Stevie! Stevie!

10:03.770 --> 10:06.106
REESE:

10:03.770 --> 10:06.106
Where the hell's the exit?

10:06.147 --> 10:08.400
We've been wandering around here

10:06.147 --> 10:08.400
for 20 minutes.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.318
DEWEY:

10:08.442 --> 10:10.318
This place is creepy.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.196
MALCOLM:

10:10.360 --> 10:13.196
Hey guys, we're right back

10:10.360 --> 10:13.196
where we started.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.989
This is the car

10:13.238 --> 10:14.989
we were riding in.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.367
I can feel where Dewey

10:15.031 --> 10:17.367
was chewing on it.

10:17.409 --> 10:18.993
REESE:

10:17.409 --> 10:18.993
Okay, I think we're

10:17.409 --> 10:18.993
out of options.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.912
We have to start a fire.

10:20.954 --> 10:21.955
Just calm down.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.331
We can find our

10:21.996 --> 10:23.331
way out of here.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.750
We just need to stay

10:23.373 --> 10:25.750
together and hold hands.

10:25.792 --> 10:28.587
Reese, give me

10:25.792 --> 10:28.587
your hand.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.005
I thought I  was  holding

10:28.628 --> 10:31.005
your hand.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.592
(screaming)

10:39.722 --> 10:41.141
Uh-oh.

10:41.182 --> 10:42.559
This is like the beginning

10:42.601 --> 10:44.644
of every horror movie

10:42.601 --> 10:44.644
I've ever seen.

10:44.685 --> 10:47.439
I think we should

10:44.685 --> 10:47.439
all split up.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.279
This place is

10:52.486 --> 10:54.279
like a cemetery

10:54.321 --> 10:55.280
with a Ferris wheel.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.573
Are we in trouble?

10:56.615 --> 10:58.366
No. The last bus

10:56.615 --> 10:58.366
leaves in 20 minutes.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.701
We just have to get outside

10:58.408 --> 11:00.701
and wait for it.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.245
Hey.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.165
Let's ask... for help.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.500
No, we'll get in trouble.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.376
Let's climb the fence

11:06.541 --> 11:08.376
and get out of here.

11:08.418 --> 11:09.710
The fences are, like,

11:08.418 --> 11:09.710
12 feet high.

11:09.752 --> 11:10.711
What about Stevie?

11:10.753 --> 11:11.796
We do it in stages.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.047
We drag his chair

11:11.838 --> 11:13.047
to the top,

11:13.089 --> 11:14.174
toss it over, and then

11:14.215 --> 11:15.634
do the same with Stevie.

11:15.674 --> 11:16.884
Hello?!

11:18.719 --> 11:19.720
Lost brother?

11:19.762 --> 11:20.721
Go for it.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.265
Uh, hi.

11:22.307 --> 11:24.100
We're really sorry,

11:22.307 --> 11:24.100
but our brother got lost

11:24.142 --> 11:25.977
and we kind of got stuck

11:24.142 --> 11:25.977
in here after closing.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.728
Would you mind

11:26.019 --> 11:27.728
unlocking the gate

11:27.770 --> 11:28.729
and letting us out?

11:28.771 --> 11:29.772
We only live a block away.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.566
So, we won't be

11:29.814 --> 11:31.566
any more trouble.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.028
You think the rules don't apply?

11:35.069 --> 11:36.488
Excuse me?

11:36.530 --> 11:39.658
My boss finds

11:36.530 --> 11:39.658
you pissants sneaking in...

11:39.698 --> 11:41.242
it's my ass!

11:42.952 --> 11:43.995
Is he mad?

11:44.037 --> 11:44.912
I don't know.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.290
He looks a little...

11:47.332 --> 11:48.916
(boys screaming)

11:56.799 --> 11:58.885
Oh, my God--

11:56.799 --> 11:58.885
side  window defrosters.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.761
I've never seen that before.

12:00.803 --> 12:01.804
FRANCIS:

12:00.803 --> 12:01.804
Hello?

12:01.846 --> 12:02.930
Francis? Hang on.

12:02.972 --> 12:06.685
I'm putting you

12:02.972 --> 12:06.685
on speakerphone.

12:06.725 --> 12:07.561
Who's this?

12:07.602 --> 12:09.479
Francis, it's Mom.

12:07.602 --> 12:09.479
We need to talk.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.481
You know, with the images

12:09.521 --> 12:11.481
I have in my brain,

12:11.523 --> 12:13.066
I think the best thing for me

12:11.523 --> 12:13.066
right now

12:13.107 --> 12:16.236
is a little distance and about

12:13.107 --> 12:16.236
15 hours of public television.

12:16.277 --> 12:18.238
Francis, would you

12:16.277 --> 12:18.238
quit clowning around?

12:18.279 --> 12:19.239
The boys are missing.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.323
What are you talking about?

12:20.365 --> 12:21.700
(loudly):

12:20.365 --> 12:21.700
We were hoping you can

12:21.740 --> 12:23.868
give us some ideas

12:21.740 --> 12:23.868
of where to look for them.

12:23.910 --> 12:24.827
Over.

12:24.869 --> 12:25.953
Hal.

12:25.995 --> 12:27.288
If you could give

12:25.995 --> 12:27.288
us some leads,

12:27.330 --> 12:29.290
it might really

12:27.330 --> 12:29.290
speed things up.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.503
See, he doesn't know

12:30.500 --> 12:33.503
you've stopped talking.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.754
No, just you're kind of putting

12:33.545 --> 12:35.754
me in an awkward position.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.674
I mean, you're asking me

12:35.796 --> 12:37.674
to rat out my brothers.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.509
Francis, we're just

12:37.716 --> 12:39.509
worried about the boys.

12:39.551 --> 12:41.261
They're not going

12:39.551 --> 12:41.261
to get into trouble.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.263
Oh? When did

12:41.302 --> 12:43.263
they get new parents?

12:43.304 --> 12:44.305
Listen,

12:43.304 --> 12:44.305
you little miscreant,

12:44.347 --> 12:45.515
you better tell me

12:44.347 --> 12:45.515
where they are

12:45.557 --> 12:46.807
before I jump

12:45.557 --> 12:46.807
through the phone

12:46.849 --> 12:48.685
and rip that smart mouth

12:46.849 --> 12:48.685
off that damn face!

12:48.727 --> 12:49.394
Who is that?

12:49.436 --> 12:50.687
My name is Kitty Kenarban,

12:50.729 --> 12:53.064
and my little boy Stevie

12:50.729 --> 12:53.064
is out there lost.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.482
His inhaler

12:53.106 --> 12:54.482
is running out,

12:54.524 --> 12:56.359
and he's got

12:54.524 --> 12:56.359
poor night vision.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.152
Wait, Stevie's with them?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.529
Okay, you didn't

12:58.194 --> 12:59.529
hear it from me,

12:59.571 --> 13:01.322
but I'd check out

12:59.571 --> 13:01.322
the old paint factory.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.990
It's fun to blow up

13:01.364 --> 13:02.990
the old cans of varnish.

13:03.032 --> 13:06.119
Oh, and the knife store on Fifth

13:03.032 --> 13:06.119
has a back door that's loose.

13:06.160 --> 13:07.704
If Stevie could swim...

13:07.746 --> 13:10.915
then I'd guess they'd be

13:07.746 --> 13:10.915
40 miles downstream by now.

13:10.957 --> 13:12.626
Look, just start

13:10.957 --> 13:12.626
at these places.

13:12.667 --> 13:13.876
The others are too alarming,

13:13.918 --> 13:16.795
and there's no sense in

13:13.918 --> 13:16.795
needlessly scaring you.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.137
Happy thoughts,

13:22.385 --> 13:24.137
happy thoughts.

13:24.178 --> 13:27.806
Puppies, ice cream,

13:24.178 --> 13:27.806
fat people falling down.

13:27.848 --> 13:28.891
I think we lost him.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.144
Where's... Dewey?

13:31.185 --> 13:32.186
Oh, my God.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.396
Where is he?

13:33.438 --> 13:35.106
Look, I say

13:33.438 --> 13:35.106
we get out of here.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.857
We can cover for Dewey.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.857
He's quiet.

13:36.899 --> 13:38.859
Mom and Dad will never

13:36.899 --> 13:38.859
know he's gone.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.861
You don't leave...

13:40.903 --> 13:43.030
a fallen... comrade.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.616
Shut up. We wouldn't

13:43.072 --> 13:44.616
be in this mess

13:44.658 --> 13:45.950
if you hadn't

13:44.658 --> 13:45.950
called for help.

13:45.992 --> 13:49.370
Keep... pushing me... dumb-ass.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.372
Look, we can find Dewey.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.874
We just need to start

13:51.414 --> 13:53.874
on one side of the park,

13:53.916 --> 13:54.875
work our way through

13:54.917 --> 13:56.877
and stay the hell

13:54.917 --> 13:56.877
away from that guard.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.879
REESE:

13:56.919 --> 13:58.879
No way, no way!

13:58.921 --> 14:00.757
We stay right here.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.925
That maniac's out

14:00.799 --> 14:02.925
there somewhere...

14:02.967 --> 14:04.885
waiting for us.

14:04.927 --> 14:06.387
(burps)

14:06.429 --> 14:08.723
(boys screaming)

14:10.433 --> 14:13.394
Save... yourselves!

14:32.330 --> 14:33.914
Oh, man, he's got Stevie.

14:33.956 --> 14:35.291
We got to do something.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.001
Why? Maybe

14:35.333 --> 14:37.001
it's his time.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.629
Who are we

14:37.043 --> 14:39.629
to play God?

14:39.671 --> 14:40.880
Reese!

14:42.674 --> 14:44.509
What is taking him so long?

14:44.551 --> 14:48.304
How many places could the boys

14:44.551 --> 14:48.304
hide in an impound lot?

14:48.346 --> 14:51.057
(large dogs barking)

14:51.098 --> 14:52.266
(screaming):

14:51.098 --> 14:52.266
Start the car!

14:52.308 --> 14:54.728
Start the car!

14:55.102 --> 14:56.896
Go, go!

14:56.937 --> 14:59.190
Go, go, go, go, go!

14:56.937 --> 14:59.190
Go, go, go, go, go.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.942
(tires screeching)

15:01.984 --> 15:03.027
(laughs)

15:03.069 --> 15:05.279
Eat our dust, you stupid dogs!

15:05.321 --> 15:07.948
Hal wins again!

15:07.990 --> 15:10.493
(chuckling)

15:10.535 --> 15:12.203
Well, they're not there.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.830
How can this

15:12.245 --> 15:13.830
be happening?

15:13.872 --> 15:16.499
Stevie never used to

15:13.872 --> 15:16.499
do things like this.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.459
He used to be

15:16.541 --> 15:18.459
such a good boy.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.337
He used to hold my yarn

15:18.501 --> 15:21.337
while I knitted.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.548
And I would hold his yarn

15:21.379 --> 15:23.548
while he knitted.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.258
He made this sweater.

15:25.299 --> 15:27.218
LOIS: Kitty,

15:25.299 --> 15:27.218
I am so sorry.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.345
This is all

15:27.260 --> 15:29.345
my boys' fault.

15:29.387 --> 15:31.972
They turn everyone they

15:29.387 --> 15:31.972
come in contact with

15:32.014 --> 15:33.140
into scheming

15:32.014 --> 15:33.140
delinquents.

15:33.182 --> 15:34.517
They're like a virus.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.269
Oh, look, we don't

15:34.559 --> 15:36.269
blame your boys--

15:36.310 --> 15:37.687
well, we do--

15:37.729 --> 15:40.022
but the thing is, Stevie

15:37.729 --> 15:40.022
has had a hand in this.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.065
I mean, he's changed.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.525
Ever since he hit middle school,

15:42.567 --> 15:43.984
he's just snippy and secretive

15:44.026 --> 15:46.279
and just shuts himself up

15:44.026 --> 15:46.279
in his room.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.449
We should never have

15:46.320 --> 15:49.449
let him have that door.

15:49.490 --> 15:52.535
I guess we're in

15:49.490 --> 15:52.535
for a few rough months.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.370
Few  months?

15:54.412 --> 15:55.955
Well, when he gets older

15:55.996 --> 15:58.249
and realizes how much

15:55.996 --> 15:58.249
he's hurting us, then...

15:58.291 --> 16:00.042
Then he'll be

15:58.291 --> 16:00.042
even better at it.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.586
Let's face it.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.171
Teenagers are thoughtless,

16:01.628 --> 16:04.171
inconsiderate, eating machines

16:04.213 --> 16:06.299
dedicated to putting

16:04.213 --> 16:06.299
us through hell

16:06.340 --> 16:08.593
and sending us

16:06.340 --> 16:08.593
to an early grave.

16:08.635 --> 16:12.096
These kids just don't know

16:08.635 --> 16:12.096
how much we suffer.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.139
(buzzing)

16:13.180 --> 16:14.557
What's that

16:13.180 --> 16:14.557
buzzing sound?

16:14.599 --> 16:17.059
Oh, it's a massage feature.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.562
I'll turn it off.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.945
You kids didn't know

16:24.066 --> 16:26.945
who you were messing with.

16:26.986 --> 16:31.031
You caught a kid...

16:26.986 --> 16:31.031
in a wheelchair.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.366
Kudos.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.493
Shut up!

16:33.534 --> 16:35.369
You talk when I say.

16:35.411 --> 16:38.038
I'm shaking... in my chair.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.215
(thuds)

16:52.094 --> 16:54.555
Don't go anywhere.

16:57.976 --> 17:00.060
I think we should run

16:57.976 --> 17:00.060
and jump the fence

17:00.102 --> 17:00.937
and get the cops.

17:00.979 --> 17:02.522
No, we should

17:00.979 --> 17:02.522
stay right here.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.232
This is good.

17:02.563 --> 17:05.232
This is smart.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.067
(rustling)

17:07.109 --> 17:08.653
We're out in the open.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.237
We've got to move.

17:10.279 --> 17:12.072
No. This guy's

17:10.279 --> 17:12.072
a psychopath.

17:12.114 --> 17:14.951
He's probably got bodies

17:12.114 --> 17:14.951
buried all over the country.

17:14.993 --> 17:17.244
The fair comes to town,

17:14.993 --> 17:17.244
he kills a bunch of locals,

17:17.286 --> 17:20.080
then packs up and moves on

17:17.286 --> 17:20.080
to the next bunch of victims.

17:20.122 --> 17:23.083
Shut up--

17:20.122 --> 17:23.083
we're going to be fine.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.836
(rustling)

17:26.462 --> 17:27.797
Look, I just want

17:26.462 --> 17:27.797
to let you know

17:27.839 --> 17:29.465
I've always tried

17:27.839 --> 17:29.465
to be a good brother.

17:29.507 --> 17:31.091
If I ever hit you

17:29.507 --> 17:31.091
or broke your stuff,

17:31.133 --> 17:33.093
it was because

17:31.133 --> 17:33.093
you deserved it and it was fun,

17:33.135 --> 17:34.679
but that doesn't

17:33.135 --> 17:34.679
make it right.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.430
Reese, please stop

17:34.721 --> 17:36.430
talking like this.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.473
We're going to be fine.

17:37.515 --> 17:39.058
(screaming)

17:37.515 --> 17:39.058
Take him!

17:40.142 --> 17:41.143
Hey, guys.

17:41.185 --> 17:43.354
Dewey, that's not funny.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.438
Where's Stevie?

17:44.480 --> 17:45.773
The guard grabbed him.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.400
Yeah, he locked him up

17:45.815 --> 17:47.400
in his trailer,

17:47.441 --> 17:49.235
and he's doing

17:47.441 --> 17:49.235
who knows what to him.

17:49.276 --> 17:51.111
Maybe my friends can help.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.613
What friends?

18:14.134 --> 18:17.096
We come in peace.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.305
(phone ringing)

18:18.347 --> 18:19.599
Hello?

18:19.640 --> 18:21.141
Hey, it's me--

18:19.640 --> 18:21.141
I talked to Richie.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.852
He has a couple ideas

18:21.183 --> 18:22.852
if you want to hear them.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.063
Roger that, Francis.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.063
Over.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.648
First off, he said

18:25.104 --> 18:27.648
the porno shop on Radford

18:27.690 --> 18:29.149
is having a parking lot sale.

18:29.191 --> 18:32.612
Oh, yeah, and the county fair

18:29.191 --> 18:32.612
is in town right now.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.114
All right.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.118
Of course, the fair.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.746
(tires screech)

18:51.672 --> 18:54.550
Your friends think

18:51.672 --> 18:54.550
they can hide, huh?

18:54.592 --> 18:57.219
I'll teach them

18:54.592 --> 18:57.219
a little lesson.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.221
They already know...

18:59.263 --> 19:00.848
how to make..

19:00.890 --> 19:03.309
six bucks... an hour.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.894
Shut up!

19:06.479 --> 19:08.188
Lothar, go.

19:22.536 --> 19:26.040
(banging)

19:41.263 --> 19:44.600
Phil, let's be

19:41.263 --> 19:44.600
reasonable about this.

19:44.642 --> 19:47.269
Why don't you

19:44.642 --> 19:47.269
let the little boy go?

19:47.311 --> 19:48.813
Get out of here, Gorak.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.773
You can't tell me what to do.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.151
I'm in charge of security.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.234
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

19:54.276 --> 19:55.319
I understand that,

19:55.361 --> 19:57.989
and you're doing a terrific job,

19:58.031 --> 20:00.700
but... I guess

19:58.031 --> 20:00.700
what I'm asking for here

20:00.741 --> 20:02.994
falls under the

20:00.741 --> 20:02.994
category of a favor.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.746
Can you do me a favor, Phil?

20:05.788 --> 20:07.999
Why should I do you a favor?

20:08.041 --> 20:10.126
You never do me any favors.

20:10.168 --> 20:13.379
Is this about

20:10.168 --> 20:13.379
the birthday party?

20:13.420 --> 20:14.714
No.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.257
Phil, I told you.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.301
I was trying to keep it small.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.803
If I invited you,

20:20.845 --> 20:23.263
I'd have to invite

20:20.845 --> 20:23.263
the concession people,

20:23.305 --> 20:27.267
the ticket takers,

20:23.305 --> 20:27.267
even the transportation guys.

20:27.309 --> 20:29.395
I can't afford that.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.314
It was nothing personal.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.273
Really?

20:33.315 --> 20:36.569
Look, we're having a poker game

20:33.315 --> 20:36.569
this weekend.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.278
Why don't you join us?

20:38.320 --> 20:40.280
Can I deal?

20:40.322 --> 20:42.033
(others chuckle)

20:42.075 --> 20:45.244
Of course you can deal.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.748
Thanks for looking

20:46.787 --> 20:48.748
after our boys, Gorak.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.457
We hope they weren't

20:48.789 --> 20:50.457
too much of a bother.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.085
Hey, I know

20:50.499 --> 20:52.085
how kids can be.

20:52.126 --> 20:54.294
I got two little

20:52.126 --> 20:54.294
monsters of my own.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.588
And, Hal, don't forget,

20:55.629 --> 20:57.297
poker this weekend.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.674
Absolutely.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.301
Too bad the boys

20:58.716 --> 21:01.301
didn't get to see our show.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.304
Next time we're in town,

21:01.343 --> 21:04.304
we'll get them backstage.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.891
Only if you take me up

21:04.346 --> 21:06.891
on that home-cooked meal.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.267
You got it, Lois.

21:08.308 --> 21:11.353
These boys have had

21:08.308 --> 21:11.353
a rough night, so...

21:11.395 --> 21:12.980
take it easy on them?

21:13.022 --> 21:16.275
Right now all I'm worried

21:13.022 --> 21:16.275
about is getting them home.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.237
(horn honks)

21:19.278 --> 21:20.696
This sucks.

21:20.738 --> 21:24.033
This would've turned out perfect

21:20.738 --> 21:24.033
if Francis didn't rat us out.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.868
What are you

21:24.075 --> 21:25.868
smiling about?

21:25.910 --> 21:29.288
Gorak gave me

21:25.910 --> 21:29.288
one of his babies.
