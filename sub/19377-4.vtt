[chorus singing] <i>Close combat</i>
<i>I'm slashing</i>

00:26.126 --> 00:30.664
<i>You who are standing in front of me</i>
<i>Who are you?</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:38.038
AJIN: DEMI-HUMAN

00:38.105 --> 00:43.210
<i>Running away but not forever</i>
<i>Chewing and swallowing reality</i>

00:43.277 --> 00:47.114
<i>Shout it out</i>
<i>And refuse ambiguity</i>

00:47.447 --> 00:51.118
<i>Though you know the danger of the dark</i>

00:51.184 --> 00:53.687
<i>A type of system that is too cold</i>

00:53.754 --> 00:57.090
<i>On or off</i>
<i>Which one is it now?</i>

00:58.225 --> 01:02.362
<i>Ending up killing emotions</i>
<i>Over and over</i>

01:02.429 --> 01:07.801
<i>No, I was just slipping through</i>
<i>Being destroyed, that's all</i>

01:08.435 --> 01:11.204
<i>Leave me alone</i>
<i>Craze</i>

01:11.271 --> 01:14.808
<i>I am I</i>
<i>Even if I am cornered</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:16.276
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:16.343 --> 01:19.146
<i>Started with nothing but risk</i>
<i>From the beginning</i>

01:19.212 --> 01:21.615
<i>Give it all you got</i>
<i>Craze</i>

01:21.682 --> 01:26.720
<i>Reveal your true self, your instincts</i>
<i>Time to strike back</i>

01:26.787 --> 01:29.156
<i>Yeah</i>
<i>So I slashed</i>

01:29.222 --> 01:31.625
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:46.506 --> 01:50.277
THEY MAKE ME SICK

01:51.244 --> 01:53.213
[man 1] <i>Takeshi Kotobuki, age 17.</i>

01:54.748 --> 01:56.717
He's the one who escaped
from our facility,

01:56.783 --> 02:00.387
only to come back voluntarily
two days later.

02:00.821 --> 02:01.688
Get up.

02:01.755 --> 02:05.826
[man 1] We questioned him for two weeks,
but couldn't get anywhere.

02:06.393 --> 02:09.863
He insists he just found himself outside
and didn't know how he got there.

02:10.497 --> 02:11.865
[man 2] Is he screwing with us?

02:12.699 --> 02:15.736
[man 1] <i>There's no evidence to tell us</i>
<i>how he got out.</i>

02:16.436 --> 02:18.839
An escape should be physically impossible.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.743
[man 2] This kind of thing could affect
our budget and upset the locals.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.512
[man 1] <i>Right, so what about this?</i>

02:26.847 --> 02:31.385
What if we just forget this ever happened?

02:35.155 --> 02:37.424
From today you'll be in this group dorm.
Get in.

02:37.858 --> 02:38.725
Yes, sir.

03:01.848 --> 03:02.916
You're Kotobuki, right?

03:04.785 --> 03:07.320
You escaped, right? News gets around.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.656
Talking isn't allowed in here.

03:10.724 --> 03:11.958
[man] So, how'd you get out?

03:12.626 --> 03:13.560
[Sighs]

03:13.627 --> 03:16.963
I don't know.
Before I knew it, I was already outside.

03:18.231 --> 03:18.932
You hear that?

03:19.199 --> 03:20.534
[both chuckle]

03:21.835 --> 03:22.836
[Kotobuki grunts]

03:22.936 --> 03:25.739
I suggest that you just tell me
the truth already, huh?

03:27.307 --> 03:28.975
-So?
-[Kaito] Yo.

03:31.611 --> 03:32.679
Knock it off.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.753
Number 18, finished.
I need a check, please.

03:43.256 --> 03:43.924
[Kotobuki] Hey.

03:46.259 --> 03:48.328
Mind your own damn business.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.431
Oh, yeah?

03:57.304 --> 03:59.473
Hey, Kotobuki, let's have a little talk.

04:01.641 --> 04:06.813
Seems to me it doesn't matter if a person
lives to be 10 years old or 100.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.616
You die either way. You know?

04:10.550 --> 04:12.619
[Kotobuki] Yep, you're right about that.

04:14.521 --> 04:15.589
Whoa, there.

04:16.623 --> 04:20.594
See, the thing is,
my girl's birthday is coming up.

04:22.462 --> 04:23.396
You follow?

04:24.698 --> 04:27.467
No, not really. I'm a virgin.

04:27.534 --> 04:28.635
[shouts]

04:30.904 --> 04:31.972
Now do you follow me?

04:32.739 --> 04:36.777
[Kotobuki] <i>Damn it.</i>
<i>I shouldn't have broken out.</i>

04:37.477 --> 04:38.812
Is there a way out?

04:39.479 --> 04:40.514
Not that I know of.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.650
Everyone in here
knows the same thing that I do.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.486
There's no way to get over that wall.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.588
So, then someone helped you?

04:49.055 --> 04:50.690
No way. That would never happen.

04:51.057 --> 04:52.926
All those other guys make me sick.

04:53.026 --> 04:54.528
[grunting]

04:57.964 --> 05:00.000
So, tell me how you got out.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.069
You can keep beating on me all you want,

05:03.770 --> 05:05.639
but don't make a big thing of it.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.574
I don't need the hassle.

05:10.877 --> 05:11.745
Hey.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.047
Kaito, you want something?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.882
This isn't exactly a fair fight.

05:16.516 --> 05:17.717
So three on two?

05:18.552 --> 05:19.953
You mean three on one.

05:20.887 --> 05:21.955
Keep me out of it.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.457
You heard him.

05:25.025 --> 05:26.459
[grunting]

05:30.697 --> 05:32.599
What's going on? Are you fighting?!

05:33.066 --> 05:34.401
[man] No, it's nothing.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.670
He looked like he wasn't feeling so good.

05:40.407 --> 05:41.675
Get back to your rooms, now!

05:41.975 --> 05:42.842
Yes, sir.

05:45.579 --> 05:47.547
Get in my way again, and you're dead.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.352
[groans]

05:53.720 --> 05:54.654
[sighs]

05:57.624 --> 06:01.828
<i>Before dawn this morning, Keita Iwasaki,</i>
<i>the Brain Science Research Center chief,</i>

06:02.495 --> 06:06.032
<i>and several police officers guarding him,</i>
<i>were killed by an unknown assailant.</i>

06:07.067 --> 06:10.570
<i>Mr. Iwasaki's name was on the list</i>
<i>posted to AJIN.net.</i>

06:10.637 --> 06:14.374
<i>The police are investigating under the</i>
<i>assumption that Sato is the perpetrator.</i>

06:17.811 --> 06:21.815
Maybe you're just trying to do a good deed
or something, but don't bother.

06:24.618 --> 06:28.955
It's you, right? That guy who helped
his Ajin friend get away?

06:30.757 --> 06:31.625
Yeah.

06:32.392 --> 06:36.396
You did all that for him,
and what did he do for you?

06:41.668 --> 06:43.670
Kei? Kei!

06:52.746 --> 06:53.647
He ditched me.

06:55.081 --> 06:55.982
I thought so.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.452
They say that you get what you give,

06:59.819 --> 07:01.688
but the world doesn't work that way.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.024
It was the same for me.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.828
All you'll get
from trying to help out again

07:09.496 --> 07:12.832
is an extended sentence
and probably some permanent injuries.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.804
And I won't give you a damn thing either.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.042
Even if I did have the power
to help you out.

07:26.680 --> 07:27.681

[both breathing heavily]

07:53.073 --> 07:54.474
[man on tv] <i>Breaking news.</i>

07:54.541 --> 07:57.777
<i>An armed assault has just taken place</i>
<i>at a hotel in the Minato ward.</i>

07:58.244 --> 08:02.182
<i>Killed in the attack were</i>
<i>Forge Security president, Keiichi Kai,</i>

08:02.248 --> 08:04.651
<i>and his aide Naomi Li.</i>

08:05.518 --> 08:08.788
<i>A man thought to be the Ajin Sato</i>
<i>was reportedly spotted at the scene.</i>

08:09.689 --> 08:14.194
<i>As the two killed were also named</i>
<i>on Sato's hit list,</i>

08:14.260 --> 08:16.730
<i>the police have judged this</i>
<i>to be the work of Sato.</i>

08:16.997 --> 08:19.199
That leaves seven more people
until the minister.

08:19.866 --> 08:22.602
We don't have much time left
to put our plans into motion.

08:22.936 --> 08:26.006
I want you to make all of the training
more focused. Got it?

08:28.141 --> 08:31.077
Okay, let's get this uploaded.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.685
<i>Hey, long time no see.</i>

08:39.152 --> 08:40.553
<i>This is Sato, the Ajin.</i>

08:42.022 --> 08:44.657
<i>We've already cleared more than</i>
<i>a third of the list,</i>

08:45.191 --> 08:48.661
<i>but there's still been no answer</i>
<i>from the Japanese government.</i>

08:50.296 --> 08:52.966
<i>Are our demands unreasonable?</i>

08:53.633 --> 08:54.868
<i>That's not the case.</i>

08:54.934 --> 08:59.672
<i>As Ajin, we just want</i>
<i>our most basic requests to be granted.</i>

09:00.640 --> 09:04.711
<i>We want formal and detailed</i>
<i>public disclosure of the experiments</i>

09:04.778 --> 09:08.548
<i>performed on Ajin by the government</i>
<i>and affiliated industries,</i>

09:08.848 --> 09:14.320
<i>as well as the profits</i>
<i>obtained from those experiments,</i>

09:14.587 --> 09:17.023
<i>and for Ajin civil rights</i>
<i>to be recognized.</i>

09:17.090 --> 09:18.725
<i>Those are our two demands.</i>

09:18.792 --> 09:24.964
<i>Our march forward may be slow,</i>
<i>but it is unstoppable.</i>

09:25.632 --> 09:30.703
<i>In order to avoid any further victims,</i>
<i>we are hoping for a swift response.</i>

09:31.938 --> 09:33.740
<i>We're expecting a good one.</i>

09:37.644 --> 09:40.747
I wonder how the government's
going to react to that.

09:41.648 --> 09:43.049
There's nothing to wonder about.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.952
They only ever have one answer.

09:47.253 --> 09:50.623
[man 1] Prime Minister! How do you intend
to respond to Sato's demands?

09:50.690 --> 09:53.359
As there have been absolutely
no experiments on Ajin,

09:53.960 --> 09:55.962
I can only face this situation
with resolve.

09:56.029 --> 09:58.364
[man 2] But aren't there indications

09:58.631 --> 10:01.901
that Tanaka was experimented on
while under government protection?

10:01.968 --> 10:03.336
<i>I will tell you this.</i>

10:03.970 --> 10:06.873
<i>The government will not yield</i>
<i>to terrorists.</i>

10:07.140 --> 10:10.910
<i>We will stand firm,</i>
<i>and resolve this situation quickly.</i>

10:14.114 --> 10:15.982
You really shouldn't get your hopes up.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.051
They make me sick.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.385
That's all right.

10:20.253 --> 10:24.290
If that's how they want to be,
we just need to act decisively is all.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.760
Mr. Sato, got a sec?

10:28.761 --> 10:29.929
Yes, of course.

10:31.764 --> 10:33.199
What the heck is he doing?

10:33.867 --> 10:35.235
He's been working on it for ages.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.169
Mm?

10:36.236 --> 10:39.205
[laughs] That's our secret weapon.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.374
[grunting]

10:49.782 --> 10:51.251
[Tosaki] They're shaping up nicely.

10:51.784 --> 10:54.287
[man] That's because we've been
really pushing them physically.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.722
[blows whistle]

10:56.189 --> 10:57.290
[groaning]

11:05.999 --> 11:08.201
-[Tosaki] What about that one matter?
-Tomorrow.

11:08.835 --> 11:12.005
Once preparations are complete,
move on to the next phase

11:12.405 --> 11:13.306
Yes, sir.

11:13.806 --> 11:14.741
[woman] Mr. Tosaki.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.243
We got a message from Sokabe.

11:17.777 --> 11:19.979
He said there's a special meeting
this afternoon.

11:20.046 --> 11:20.947
Special meeting?

11:21.915 --> 11:25.084
-About the Forge Security issue?
-No, it's...

11:25.151 --> 11:28.354
Some people are coming
from the U.S. Department of Defense.

11:39.332 --> 11:42.368
This doesn't look like
a Control Commission meeting to me.

11:43.002 --> 11:44.837
It's the Department of Defense, right?

11:45.238 --> 11:48.308
They might have some advice
for anti-Ajin measures.

11:49.042 --> 11:49.943
Advice?

11:51.110 --> 11:53.046
Like it's their place to interfere.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.182
Sokabe hasn't told you anything, right?

11:56.816 --> 12:00.186
Apparently, Sokabe doesn't know
any of the details either.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.222
Right this way, please.

12:06.426 --> 12:07.860
Thank you for your patience.

12:08.361 --> 12:14.167
This is Douglas Almeida and Carly Myers
of the U.S. Department of Defense.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.302
Please, go ahead.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.039
First of all, we appreciate
you making time for us.

12:20.907 --> 12:24.177
We've been sent here
to launch a full investigation

12:24.243 --> 12:27.046
on the deaths of Dr. Ogura
and his bodyguard.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.516
Both of whom were killed
in Sato's recent attack.

12:32.418 --> 12:36.055
Therefore, we've asked everyone who was
at the research facility on that day

12:36.122 --> 12:37.190
to join us here today.

12:37.824 --> 12:42.829
Actually, our own investigations prove
they were definitely killed by Sato.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.765
Is further investigation necessary?

12:45.832 --> 12:49.235
Yes, and this matter involves
a great deal of classified information.

12:49.802 --> 12:51.871
We'd much rather not
have you sniffing around.

12:51.938 --> 12:55.541
[Almeida] Our plans have already been
cleared with the Japanese government.

12:57.076 --> 12:58.811
We're too busy for this now.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.047
You realize it's very rare

13:01.381 --> 13:06.185
for U.S. personnel to be injured or killed
in a foreign research facility.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.189
So, the Department of Defense must have
a detailed understanding

13:10.256 --> 13:12.025
of the circumstances of their deaths.

13:12.558 --> 13:13.893
During the investigation,

13:13.960 --> 13:17.997
we'll be asking each one of you
exactly what happened on that day.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.033
We appreciate your help.

13:20.099 --> 13:22.268
More things we have to worry about.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.237
[men whispering]
Why are we being investigated?

13:24.303 --> 13:26.205
Are we getting interviewed individually?

13:26.472 --> 13:28.541
Those black suits were from the Pentagon?

13:32.245 --> 13:35.214
-Mr. Tosaki, what should we--?
-We're fine.

13:35.281 --> 13:39.052
I erased the security video
of me shooting the bodyguard,

13:39.118 --> 13:40.486
and doctored the dental records

13:40.553 --> 13:43.256
of the researcher
whose body I used in place of Ogura's.

13:44.991 --> 13:48.528
But... we're going to need to come up
with a solid cover story.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.898
Put together all the records for that day.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.466
Yes, sir.

14:03.209 --> 14:06.112
Damn it. Why now, of all times?

14:15.021 --> 14:20.059
We can't see IBMs with our eyes,
but there are ways to detect them.

14:23.496 --> 14:24.530
Go ahead, walk.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.133
Shut up.

14:30.937 --> 14:32.138
Nakano.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.272
On it!

14:39.512 --> 14:41.080
If you run into one directly...

14:42.148 --> 14:43.649
there are ways to take them down.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.186
You know, just like a woman.

14:47.987 --> 14:51.424
But of course, in the field,
it won't be this easy.

14:53.092 --> 14:56.963
The most reliable approach
is to knock out the Ajin that summoned it.

14:59.232 --> 15:03.569
With a normal IBM,
that will neutralize them.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.979
You've got him pretty well housebroken.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.313
Hmm.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.492
[thud then Kotobuki gasps]

15:27.960 --> 15:31.330
Wake up, Kotobuki.
This is the last time I'm gonna ask you.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.967
You don't know when to give up.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.703
I bet you drive your girlfriend crazy.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.440
[grunting]

15:49.081 --> 15:50.483
[Kotobuki screams]

15:54.454 --> 15:57.290
My girl's birthday is tomorrow.

15:59.192 --> 16:02.728
You do this and you're not going
to be getting out of here for a while.

16:03.429 --> 16:04.597
Whatever.

16:04.664 --> 16:07.200
There's no point if I can't get out today.

16:17.176 --> 16:18.110
[Kaito] <i>That's right.</i>

16:19.345 --> 16:23.683
<i>Just stay right there,</i>
<i>pretend you don't see anything.</i>

16:27.019 --> 16:28.221
<i>It's just your imagination.</i>

16:30.623 --> 16:34.260
<i>Two days from now</i>
<i>I will start a protest movement!</i>

16:34.427 --> 16:37.663
<i>It'll take place in front of</i>
<i>the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare!</i>

16:38.564 --> 16:41.734
[Kotobuki] <i>It was my hesitation.</i>

16:43.102 --> 16:44.303
Thanks for coming.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.040
Now I'll tell you
the real gathering place.

16:48.741 --> 16:52.445
-I don't know about you, but I'm going.
-Me, too.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.616
[Kotobuki] <i>What should I do?</i>

16:58.451 --> 17:02.054
So, are you going to head
to the gathering place?

17:02.121 --> 17:03.155
[grunting]

17:03.656 --> 17:05.525
No, seems like a pain.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.461
[Kotobuki] <i>Yeah, he's probably right.</i>

17:13.266 --> 17:16.068
Look, if you don't wanna die,
then just tell me.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.088
You bastard.

17:42.261 --> 17:44.664
[Kotobuki] <i>What's wrong with this idiot?</i>

18:00.513 --> 18:02.214
<i>No, he's not an idiot.</i>

18:06.619 --> 18:07.853
<i>He's a complete moron.</i>

18:12.525 --> 18:13.593
[gasping]

18:19.765 --> 18:22.868
Didn't I tell you that I'd kill you?

18:51.464 --> 18:53.199
[wheezing]

19:08.314 --> 19:09.815
Basic training is done.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.552
Starting today, it's field training.

19:18.257 --> 19:19.558
[man] Sorry for taking so long.

19:19.625 --> 19:22.628
Oh, no, this is great.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.766
Once this is done,
we're gonna have a hell of a lot of fun.

19:27.566 --> 19:31.804
Yeah, well, no one else
could come up with this.

19:33.239 --> 19:36.542
But making it is going to take
a whole lot of explosives.

19:37.443 --> 19:38.711
That won't be a problem.

19:39.478 --> 19:43.182
We have some leftovers
from what Nekozawa provided us last time.

19:44.650 --> 19:45.785
Now, then...

19:48.521 --> 19:50.589
how about we breeze through
the second half...

19:51.223 --> 19:54.360
so we can use our secret weapon?

20:03.436 --> 20:04.737
[Kotobuki grunts]

20:05.604 --> 20:06.472
Smoke?

20:09.909 --> 20:11.844
I hear they're all being put in solitary.

20:12.578 --> 20:14.313
And they won't be out for a while.

20:17.283 --> 20:20.219
I have a secret supplier.
Don't look into it.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.839
Hey... what kind of guy is Kei Nagai?

20:43.809 --> 20:44.677
Kei is...

20:46.412 --> 20:47.413
a good friend.

20:48.647 --> 20:49.515
My first one.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.450
But he left you behind, right?

20:52.351 --> 20:53.486
Aren't you pissed?

20:54.553 --> 20:56.622
If he doesn't need my help, I'll back off.

20:58.624 --> 21:00.526
But if anything happens, I'm there.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.262
No matter what it takes.

21:05.998 --> 21:06.999
Know what?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.001
You really are annoying.

21:10.803 --> 21:11.670
Yeah...

21:12.738 --> 21:13.672
I know.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.348
Hypothetically, Kaito...

21:23.749 --> 21:26.619
let's say something happens
to Kei Nagai...

21:27.620 --> 21:30.322
and you really need
to get out of this dump.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.558
You come talk to me.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.497
I'll only do it once...

21:39.331 --> 21:41.033
but I'll get you over this wall.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.977
TO BE CONTINUED

21:53.312 --> 21:56.348
[chorus singing]
<i>I'm tired of this one already, so</i>

21:56.415 --> 21:59.618
<i>I'll trade it</i>

21:59.685 --> 22:04.824
<i>For your ordinary one</i>

22:05.958 --> 22:11.997
<i>A shiny holy card</i>

22:12.464 --> 22:17.436
<i>For a grainy paper card</i>

22:18.637 --> 22:22.842
<i>You can see them all</i>

22:25.077 --> 22:29.048
<i>When you come to my house</i>

22:29.682 --> 22:35.721
<i>So</i>
<i>Two of us in the corner of the schoolyard</i>

22:35.788 --> 22:37.890
<i>While the wind blows</i>

22:37.957 --> 22:43.462
<i>I might be able to say it now</i>

22:44.463 --> 22:50.669
<i>Words I've never said to anyone</i>

22:50.736 --> 22:56.976
<i>"Won't you come and play, I'll be nice"</i>

22:57.042 --> 23:02.681
<i>"I'll give you anything, see"</i>

23:03.616 --> 23:06.385
<i>"Be my friend</i>

23:06.452 --> 23:13.092
<i>Always"</i>

23:25.404 --> 23:27.406
