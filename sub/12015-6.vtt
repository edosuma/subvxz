Jesse goes missing

00:02.029 --> 00:03.070
<i>20 years ago.</i>

00:03.230 --> 00:05.030
But his DNA turns up
at the murder scene

00:05.190 --> 00:06.230
<i>of Selena Callaway.</i>

00:06.390 --> 00:07.230
We think she's possibly

00:07.390 --> 00:08.390
<i>a prostitute.</i>

00:08.550 --> 00:10.830
- I'm looking for her.
- <i>Selena worked for these guys</i>

00:10.990 --> 00:12.870
- and got involved in the scam.
- What scam?

00:13.030 --> 00:16.070
<i>They're blackmailing people
into giving names and credit histories.</i>

00:16.230 --> 00:17.430
This was a huge operation.

00:17.590 --> 00:20.430
<i>What did Selina have on her hard
drive that was worth killing her for?</i>

00:21.350 --> 00:22.990
<i>You stay away from Alexa!</i>

00:23.150 --> 00:25.270
I got jumped this morning
by this guy Payne.

00:25.430 --> 00:27.630
<i>Porter & Starr.
Where Selena Callaway worked.</i>

00:27.790 --> 00:28.710
<i>These can't be coincidences.</i>

00:28.870 --> 00:30.750
What's the connection?
Is it to do with Jesse?

00:31.510 --> 00:33.710
<i>What we were involved in
scares me.</i>

00:33.870 --> 00:36.390
<i>If I find out what the deal is
with this Alexa Mills,</i>

00:36.550 --> 00:38.270
I'll get some answers about Jesse.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.030
Selena Callaway's daughter
is called Alexa.

00:40.190 --> 00:41.350
<i>My dad's still missing.</i>

00:41.510 --> 00:42.950
You really haven't been trying.

00:43.110 --> 00:44.430
I promise to make amends.

00:44.590 --> 00:47.150
Your dad ran the investigation
into Jesse's disappearance.

00:47.310 --> 00:49.230
<i>Have you checked his old case files?</i>

00:49.390 --> 00:50.430
Where are the files?

00:50.590 --> 00:52.710
- Rough day?
- Just get me drunk.

00:59.350 --> 01:02.670
<i>I hope we're watching this
together, and laughing...</i>

01:02.830 --> 01:04.510
<i>somewhere sunny...</i>

01:06.470 --> 01:08.110
<i>Australia, maybe.</i>

01:10.870 --> 01:12.350
<i>Or Florida.</i>

01:16.150 --> 01:18.670
<i>You always wanted to go
to Disneyland as a kid.</i>

01:22.230 --> 01:23.990
<i>But if we're not together,</i>

01:24.150 --> 01:26.630
<i>then something's
probably happened to me.</i>

01:28.790 --> 01:32.150
<i>The information on this memory stick
is what got me killed.</i>

01:32.310 --> 01:34.430
<i>But it's gonna keep you alive.</i>

01:34.950 --> 01:37.110
<i>This is what I want you to do.</i>

02:12.470 --> 02:14.070
Morning, tiger.

02:26.470 --> 02:27.830
I've got a lot of work on.

02:27.990 --> 02:29.750
It's my mum's 60th.
I don't see her every day.

02:29.910 --> 02:30.750
Lorraine.

02:30.910 --> 02:32.430
It's Jennifer.

02:34.830 --> 02:36.270
Who's gonna look after the kids?

02:36.430 --> 02:38.030
Megan can look after herself.

02:38.190 --> 02:40.710
- So can I!
- The boys can do after-school club.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.150
Who's gonna look after Dad?

02:42.310 --> 02:44.310
I can't baby-sit.
I've got work.

02:45.670 --> 02:47.470
That's for you to sort out.

02:48.550 --> 02:50.310
OK. OK, when are you back?

02:50.470 --> 02:52.710
I don't know, Danny.
When you've sorted it.

02:52.870 --> 02:54.270
Jennifer, I...

02:55.710 --> 02:58.230
Jennifer? Jennifer!

03:01.070 --> 03:02.750
<i>Hey, it's Ally.</i>

03:02.910 --> 03:05.070
<i>I'm probably on a call
because I'm so popular.</i>

03:05.230 --> 03:06.790
Yeah, it's me.
Head to the park.

03:06.950 --> 03:09.910
I want to check out a new route
Jesse may have taken. Um...

03:10.070 --> 03:11.550
Call me straight back.

03:12.510 --> 03:13.750
<i>Do you want to get</i>

03:13.910 --> 03:15.270
a breakfast smoothie
or something?

03:15.430 --> 03:18.310
- Gotta replace those fluids.
- I just want to get to work.

03:18.470 --> 03:20.950
We hooked up. It's not like
we have to get married.

03:21.110 --> 03:22.790
How about we never
talk about it again?

03:22.950 --> 03:24.270
Speechless, eh?

03:25.430 --> 03:27.110
Do you mind if we stop for a sec?

03:27.270 --> 03:29.350
I've just got to drop something off
for my dad.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.830
Don't be too long, yeah?

03:37.990 --> 03:40.630
Aw... can't bear to be without me, eh?

03:50.510 --> 03:52.030
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

03:55.430 --> 03:56.670
Hello.

03:57.470 --> 04:00.950
I wanted to call but I know that...
Stuart checks your phone.

04:01.550 --> 04:04.470
- Yeah, but not in a psycho way.
- Right. Right.

04:04.630 --> 04:06.030
Right.

04:06.190 --> 04:09.550
So that's why he tracked you
to my flat last night.

04:11.070 --> 04:13.510
That was my fault.
I was pissed.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.110
And he was just worried.

04:15.870 --> 04:19.110
I thought it would be funny to give
you a shock through your window.

04:21.350 --> 04:23.630
- Certainly did that.
- I'm really sorry.

04:24.790 --> 04:27.750
I'm such a dick.
Can I just take you out for breakfast

04:27.910 --> 04:29.630
to make up for it?

04:29.790 --> 04:31.070
I can't today.

04:31.550 --> 04:33.670
I've got to try and find that Alexa.

04:33.830 --> 04:35.830
- Coming in?
- Yeah.

04:44.070 --> 04:46.510
- Hey, Mercy.
- Hiya.

04:46.670 --> 04:49.550
- Any sign of Slade?
- Oh, nothing. Sorry.

04:49.710 --> 04:51.670
And we can really use him back.

04:51.830 --> 04:54.470
Well, I mean, I'm around.
What's up?

04:54.630 --> 04:57.750
Rashan's been giving free prison
tats in memory of Britnay.

04:57.910 --> 04:59.470
Proper biro and syringe job.

04:59.630 --> 05:01.670
Now half the kids are feeling rough.

05:01.830 --> 05:03.430
Yeah, that's infected.

05:04.390 --> 05:07.990
- Shouldn't that be an "E"?
- No, it's an "A", for "Britnay".

05:08.390 --> 05:09.870
Oh. Sorry.

05:10.390 --> 05:12.390
- Here. Let me have a look at that.
- Yeah?

05:15.310 --> 05:16.790
- Mercy.
- Yeah?

05:16.950 --> 05:19.190
Do you know a girl called Alexa?
Been here a couple of days.

05:19.350 --> 05:21.870
- She's got a cast on her arm.
- Oh, I think so.

05:22.030 --> 05:23.470
She's definitely not a regular

05:23.630 --> 05:26.230
but I think I've seen her
talking to...

05:26.390 --> 05:28.470
to Lorna. Over there.

05:28.830 --> 05:30.270
OK.

05:50.110 --> 05:52.190
I don't know what to say, Dad.

05:52.350 --> 05:55.790
I mean, she's funny.
She's hardy, but she's funny.

05:57.110 --> 06:00.430
And she's pretty.
Oh, God, she's pretty, Dad.

06:00.590 --> 06:01.750
Here we go.

06:01.910 --> 06:04.270
I mean, she could probably do

06:04.430 --> 06:06.630
with working
on her cardio a bit but...

06:07.110 --> 06:09.310
- Is she blonde?
- Yeah. Why?

06:10.550 --> 06:12.830
Sorry. I was just looking
for a glass of water.

06:12.990 --> 06:14.710
- I um...
- Oh.

06:14.870 --> 06:16.750
Right. Well, Ally...

06:16.910 --> 06:18.630
this is my dad, Ron.

06:18.790 --> 06:21.350
Dad, this is my workmate, Ally.

06:21.510 --> 06:22.430
Hi.

06:22.830 --> 06:24.070
She's gorgeous.

06:26.430 --> 06:28.150
<i>God, I don't even know
my dad's name.</i>

06:28.990 --> 06:31.990
My mum wanted a baby
but she couldn't be bothered with a man.

06:32.430 --> 06:35.870
Clock was ticking so she had IVF
and brought me up on her own.

06:36.030 --> 06:38.870
- Explains a lot.
- Such as?

06:39.950 --> 06:42.750
Well, you're independent,
career-minded...

06:43.190 --> 06:45.830
looking for a strong man
to call Daddy.

06:46.430 --> 06:48.430
That's why you're not in profiling.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.830
Hey, do you um... want me
to drop you off round the corner?

06:52.990 --> 06:55.790
You know, arrive at work separately?

06:57.150 --> 06:59.870
No, it's all right.
I'm too hungover to walk.

07:02.390 --> 07:04.390
No. I don't "know her" know her.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.350
Like, I only met her here.

07:07.750 --> 07:09.710
Do you know where she is?

07:12.710 --> 07:15.390
Did she mention any men at all?
Like a teacher?

07:15.750 --> 07:17.510
<i>My father teaches at my school.</i>

07:17.670 --> 07:19.310
<i>Do any of you know
a Mr. Kenton Marshall?</i>

07:19.470 --> 07:22.550
<i>Try the store cupboard.
In case he's doing Alexa again.</i>

07:23.150 --> 07:25.790
This is really important
because she could be in trouble.

07:25.950 --> 07:27.870
Look, I don't know where she is.

07:28.030 --> 07:31.030
But when I first ran away,
I stayed with mates. Yeah?

07:31.870 --> 07:35.550
Till they started getting sick of me
or wanted something back.

07:35.710 --> 07:37.430
Maybe she's doing the same.

07:39.230 --> 07:41.430
<i>All that back there, about Alexa.
It's just gossip.</i>

07:47.550 --> 07:48.910
- Hi.
- Hey.

07:49.350 --> 07:51.830
Sorry I missed your call.
My phone died.

07:51.990 --> 07:53.550
Oh, Karl. There's your girlfriend.

07:58.070 --> 07:59.190
Hey.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.550
- Did I miss anything last night?
- No.

08:05.150 --> 08:06.390
Good.

08:19.510 --> 08:20.790
Don't ask.

08:20.950 --> 08:22.390
<i>OK, this is the route that Marosi</i>

08:22.550 --> 08:23.470
confessed to.

08:23.630 --> 08:26.590
So if we assume that he was trying
to put the investigation off,

08:26.750 --> 08:29.830
then Jesse couldn't have gone
that way because of Slade and Pru.

08:29.990 --> 08:32.510
I guess this is the area
that we need to be focusing on.

08:32.669 --> 08:34.870
- Ally?
- What's the appeal?

08:35.590 --> 08:38.270
Parents? Kids?
Why put yourself through it?

08:39.070 --> 08:41.309
Love, duty, genetic hardwiring.

08:41.470 --> 08:43.270
What's the alternative?

08:43.669 --> 08:45.190
Oh, I don't know.

08:46.070 --> 08:48.910
Self-fulfilment, world travel,
career advancement.

08:50.470 --> 08:52.510
Hey, at least I get a lie-in.

08:54.990 --> 08:57.150
Danny. Danny! Danny!

08:59.390 --> 09:02.790
Listen. You do not go in there
on your own.

09:03.670 --> 09:05.270
Remember what happened last year?

09:05.430 --> 09:07.470
- Last year?
- Last year?

09:07.630 --> 09:10.390
His friend's little brother
went missing from here.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.510
Terrible.

09:15.070 --> 09:18.350
You worked on that case, didn't you?
Jakob Marosi.

09:18.510 --> 09:20.670
That's right.
Nasty piece of work.

09:20.830 --> 09:23.790
Yeah, we're on something similar
at the moment. A missing kid.

09:23.950 --> 09:26.790
Could still be alive
if we get to him in time.

09:27.670 --> 09:30.390
I'd love to take a look
through those files.

09:30.550 --> 09:31.750
Nothing in them.

09:31.910 --> 09:33.550
Marosi's inside.

09:34.830 --> 09:37.350
Yeah, I know, but the line
of inquiry could be useful.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.710
Mm.

09:38.870 --> 09:42.190
Off the record,
his parents are going spare.

09:42.350 --> 09:43.710
Imagine if it were Danny.

09:51.870 --> 09:53.950
I hid them in my basement.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.830
Hey. What did you do that for?

09:59.990 --> 10:02.550
Daniel! How many times?

10:04.190 --> 10:06.390
Nice try,
but we don't have a basement.

10:06.550 --> 10:10.590
Listen, when we get home, you put
that in the shed and leave it there.

10:10.750 --> 10:13.270
No kicking it
against Nana's dresser again.

10:13.430 --> 10:14.550
- OK?
- OK.

10:14.710 --> 10:16.150
Let's go.

10:16.310 --> 10:19.430
Ah, he kept Nana's dresser
in the basement.

10:19.590 --> 10:21.270
Of our old house.

10:21.710 --> 10:23.830
Come on.
OK, road trip, everybody!

11:15.750 --> 11:16.950
Hey.

11:18.470 --> 11:19.870
I'm here.

11:22.150 --> 11:24.950
- I brought food.
- Thank you so much.

11:25.550 --> 11:27.910
I've got you some apples
and a couple of sandwiches.

11:28.510 --> 11:30.190
Thank you.

11:30.350 --> 11:32.510
OK. So I have to go
back to class now.

11:32.670 --> 11:34.070
Thank you.

12:03.430 --> 12:04.830
Alexa?

12:06.350 --> 12:07.710
Get out!

12:07.870 --> 12:10.270
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait.
- Get out!

12:10.430 --> 12:12.270
- Alexa. Alexa.
- Get off!

12:12.430 --> 12:15.230
- Alexa, my name's Mark.
- Get out!

12:15.390 --> 12:16.990
I help down at the shelter sometimes.

12:17.150 --> 12:19.750
With Slade. You know Slade, right?
Remember Slade?

12:21.310 --> 12:22.950
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Where is he?

12:24.830 --> 12:27.590
Our friend died
and he had to go away.

12:28.830 --> 12:29.790
Look at me.

12:32.270 --> 12:35.310
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

12:38.150 --> 12:39.590
I'm here to help you.

12:42.590 --> 12:45.950
I'm here to protect you.
From Payne.

12:47.190 --> 12:50.070
- And Kenton.
- What do you know about Kenton?

12:50.230 --> 12:55.350
I've been hired by Kenton's family
to help find him.

12:55.510 --> 12:58.470
- <i>My father's gone missing.</i>
- <i>Simon needs a father.</i>

12:58.630 --> 13:01.390
<i>He needs his routine. I appreciate
everything you've been doing</i>

13:01.550 --> 13:02.510
<i>looking for Kenton.</i>

13:02.670 --> 13:05.110
<i>All part of the ex-lover service.</i>

13:06.350 --> 13:09.310
But I heard about the two of you.
What he's been doing to you.

13:09.470 --> 13:12.830
- What are you talking about?
- He's in a position of authority

13:12.990 --> 13:14.470
and you're underage.

13:15.550 --> 13:17.270
Do you think...

13:17.750 --> 13:19.550
- No.
- It's not your fault.

13:19.710 --> 13:21.030
Kenton's my dad.

13:23.990 --> 13:26.750
If Kenton is your father, Alexa,
do you know where he is?

13:26.910 --> 13:28.150
No.

13:28.310 --> 13:31.710
I don't mean to be harsh,
but his family never mentioned you.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.430
They don't know about me.

13:34.110 --> 13:36.510
I didn't even know till last week.

13:38.070 --> 13:39.150
Mr. Marshall...

13:40.830 --> 13:44.030
Dad, had a thing with my mum
back in the day.

13:45.390 --> 13:47.630
She got pregnant.
He didn't want to know.

13:48.470 --> 13:51.630
She never really talked about it
and last year she put me in that school.

13:51.990 --> 13:54.870
My mum was afraid something
might happen to her.

13:55.550 --> 13:57.030
And it did.

13:59.070 --> 14:00.390
She got killed.

14:01.470 --> 14:02.790
Murdered.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.670
Alexa, I want to help you.

14:05.830 --> 14:07.590
I'm a friend. OK?

14:09.470 --> 14:11.590
Why? Why do you want to help me?

14:12.550 --> 14:14.830
My brother disappeared 20 years ago.

14:17.030 --> 14:20.990
His DNA... turned up
at your mum's murder scene.

14:21.910 --> 14:23.270
What?

14:24.830 --> 14:27.590
<i>We thought we had him back.
And you think it could be him?</i>

14:29.470 --> 14:31.430
<i>But it turned out we were wrong.</i>

14:31.590 --> 14:32.590
<i>This isn't Jesse.</i>

14:34.510 --> 14:37.830
And I don't know if he was a witness

14:37.990 --> 14:40.270
or if he was trying to help your mum,

14:40.710 --> 14:44.150
but her... him... you, Kenton...

14:44.310 --> 14:46.870
Somehow it's all connected.

15:01.910 --> 15:02.990
Well...

15:05.030 --> 15:07.750
- This is it.
- Just in time for dinner.

15:10.750 --> 15:13.030
You should stay here.
It's gonna be weird enough

15:13.190 --> 15:15.430
without my mad dad, my kid and you.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.390
Lucky me.

15:36.110 --> 15:37.270
<i>Oi!</i>

15:50.670 --> 15:52.310
Hi. Sorry to bother you.

15:52.470 --> 15:55.510
This is gonna sound a little weird.
I'm a police officer.

15:55.670 --> 15:58.830
It's nothing to worry about.
My family used to live here.

15:58.990 --> 16:01.310
And my dad...

16:01.470 --> 16:03.910
I think my dad might have
left something in your basement.

16:05.630 --> 16:06.790
Are you Danny?

16:09.270 --> 16:10.430
Come in.

16:19.310 --> 16:21.390
<i>But the holiday's been booked
for months!</i>

16:21.550 --> 16:23.750
- <i>You know how important this case is!</i>
- <i>Get off her!</i>

16:23.910 --> 16:25.310
<i>Oh!</i>

16:26.910 --> 16:29.110
<i>Get out! Run!</i>

16:29.270 --> 16:30.670
We kept your measurements.

16:37.990 --> 16:39.470
Oh, yeah.

16:39.630 --> 16:42.550
We just felt it gave the place
a bit of character.

16:43.710 --> 16:47.030
I've always wanted kids of my own,
but... Glyn's like...

16:48.390 --> 16:51.390
You're gonna need a torch
if you're going in the basement.

17:02.590 --> 17:03.790
Do you mind if I...

17:10.069 --> 17:11.510
Glyn is gonna hate this.

17:11.670 --> 17:14.190
Right. I just need you a bit more...

17:15.270 --> 17:16.910
Right. Just...

17:18.190 --> 17:19.710
Stay very still.

17:22.950 --> 17:24.630
- That's great.
- OK. Great, great, great.

17:24.790 --> 17:27.069
So, um, can we um...

17:28.069 --> 17:29.830
Oh, yeah, sorry.

17:29.990 --> 17:33.150
I get really claustrophobic
so I'm gonna leave the basement to you.

17:44.870 --> 17:47.710
She gave me this a few weeks ago.

17:48.950 --> 17:50.750
It's got files on it.

17:51.990 --> 17:54.230
Of all the people they ever scammed.

17:58.670 --> 18:01.510
She made me a video.

18:02.270 --> 18:05.270
<i>I hope we're watching this
together and laughing.</i>

18:06.150 --> 18:08.790
<i>That's when she told me
about my real dad.</i>

18:08.950 --> 18:11.150
<i>His name is Kenton Marshall.</i>

18:13.150 --> 18:15.590
<i>That's why I've sent you
to that school.</i>

18:17.030 --> 18:20.870
<i>In case you ever need him.
He's a good man.</i>

18:22.190 --> 18:23.790
<i>He will look after you.</i>

18:24.550 --> 18:26.470
<i>I didn't have nowhere else to go.</i>

18:31.150 --> 18:33.070
<i>I didn't know
how he was gonna react.</i>

18:33.230 --> 18:35.990
If he'd even recognise her
after all these years.

18:40.070 --> 18:41.310
<i>But he did.</i>

18:42.750 --> 18:45.150
<i>And he looked at me and he knew.</i>

18:58.790 --> 19:00.990
<i>I showed him Mum's video.</i>

19:01.150 --> 19:04.110
<i>They would have
forced you into their scams, Alexa.</i>

19:04.270 --> 19:05.750
<i>So I tried to get out.</i>

19:05.910 --> 19:07.870
<i>That's why Dominic Porter
had me killed.</i>

19:08.030 --> 19:10.870
<i>You have to get as far away
from here as possible.</i>

19:11.590 --> 19:15.190
<i>This memory stick is evidence
linking Porter to the scams.</i>

19:15.670 --> 19:17.550
<i>If anyone comes after you,</i>

19:17.710 --> 19:20.230
<i>you tell them you've got
the file somewhere safe.</i>

19:20.390 --> 19:24.310
<i>Porter won't kill you
if he thinks he could get exposed.</i>

19:24.990 --> 19:26.710
<i>Ask Kenton to help you.</i>

19:28.550 --> 19:31.110
<i>He wanted to call the police,
but she said not to.</i>

19:31.710 --> 19:34.070
<i>Porter's got a guy on the inside.</i>

19:34.990 --> 19:37.910
<i>They'll bury the evidence
and make you disappear.</i>

19:41.390 --> 19:43.230
<i>He told me to go
to my mum's place</i>

19:43.390 --> 19:45.270
<i>and wait for him to come and get me.</i>

19:45.430 --> 19:48.750
<i>I was careful but there was this guy
in a yellow car.</i>

19:54.750 --> 19:56.150
What did he look like?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.590
Where are the files?

20:02.630 --> 20:04.870
It all happened so fast.

20:06.150 --> 20:09.350
I fought back. My mum
always made me carry rape spray.

20:13.150 --> 20:14.630
That's when he broke my arm.

20:20.110 --> 20:22.030
<i>I ran but I didn't know where to go.</i>

20:23.150 --> 20:26.630
<i>I'd heard about this shelter
for homeless kids.</i>

20:27.350 --> 20:29.710
<i>It was the closest place
I could think of.</i>

20:31.390 --> 20:34.070
<i>And that is when I met Slade.</i>

20:34.230 --> 20:36.110
- <i>Are you all right?</i>
- <i>Please help me.</i>

20:36.270 --> 20:39.070
<i>Shh. It's all right.
It's all right. You're safe.</i>

20:40.510 --> 20:41.630
He was cool...

20:42.390 --> 20:44.390
And then my phone started ringing.

20:47.070 --> 20:50.270
I didn't pick it up.
I didn't know who it was.

20:51.190 --> 20:52.470
And he left a message.

20:54.310 --> 20:55.310
<i>Alexa,</i>

20:55.470 --> 20:56.670
it's me.

20:56.830 --> 20:59.230
Look, I know you're scared.

20:59.990 --> 21:03.070
But I've thought about what your mum
said and I didn't call the police.

21:04.670 --> 21:07.750
I guess there's no point in going
public if we don't have to.

21:08.670 --> 21:10.390
We can't just run, though.

21:11.030 --> 21:13.950
So I tracked down Dominic Porter.

21:14.390 --> 21:17.070
If he wants that information back,
I'm gonna offer it to him,

21:17.230 --> 21:20.150
but only if he leaves you alone.

21:20.710 --> 21:23.710
I'm gonna meet him at a hotel
called the Old Town.

21:28.630 --> 21:32.470
I had no idea what to do
so I told Slade everything.

21:33.190 --> 21:35.510
And he went to the hotel
to help Dad.

21:36.310 --> 21:38.990
Slade went to the Old Town Hotel?

21:47.830 --> 21:50.350
He said he'd only be
a couple of hours but he was...

21:50.510 --> 21:52.350
three, four.

21:54.310 --> 21:56.030
I got scared so I came here.

21:58.030 --> 22:00.550
I just want to know what happened
in that hotel.

22:00.910 --> 22:03.630
I just want to know
what happened to my dad.

23:20.350 --> 23:21.910
Slade, it's me.

23:23.190 --> 23:25.390
I've found Alexa.

23:26.070 --> 23:28.630
She's scared. She needs to know
what's going on. So do I.

23:28.790 --> 23:29.870
So can you call me, please?

23:50.590 --> 23:52.630
- Have you got children?
- No.

23:53.150 --> 23:54.670
- Boyfriend?
- No.

23:54.830 --> 23:56.030
Girlfriend?

23:58.070 --> 24:00.790
- Why not?
- Cause I'm happy as I am. All right?

24:00.950 --> 24:02.150
OK.

24:02.910 --> 24:06.670
In this job,
it's the best way to be.

24:07.350 --> 24:08.710
No distractions.

24:11.310 --> 24:13.150
No one to worry about.

24:13.590 --> 24:14.870
Just the case.

24:16.510 --> 24:20.630
Lorraine always used to hate
that house, when we lived here.

24:22.910 --> 24:24.510
- Drive safe.
- Thanks.

24:36.430 --> 24:38.510
She looks terrified.

24:40.150 --> 24:42.070
Is it to do with her teacher?

24:43.950 --> 24:45.470
It's a long story.

24:46.150 --> 24:48.670
And to think we nearly sent
our daughter to that school.

24:55.190 --> 24:56.630
Is it Slade?

24:56.790 --> 25:00.070
Uh, no. No, it's not. No.

25:01.670 --> 25:03.110
Hey, can I call you back in a bit?

25:03.270 --> 25:06.510
Uh, no, Mark.
Simon's having a really bad day.

25:06.670 --> 25:08.430
<i>Do you mind talking
to him for a minute?</i>

25:08.590 --> 25:10.550
Mum, he doesn't do anything.

25:12.150 --> 25:14.270
- Just give me a sec. OK?
- Mm.

25:18.630 --> 25:22.390
- You all right, Alexa?
- Yeah. I'm gonna go for a cigarette.

25:22.550 --> 25:23.550
OK.

25:25.390 --> 25:26.950
How are you doing after last night?

25:27.110 --> 25:28.310
Yeah. You know, fine.

25:29.510 --> 25:30.870
I don't have a lot of time.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.030
OK. I'm gonna put you
on speaker phone.

25:35.190 --> 25:37.710
- <i>Hey, Simon.</i>
- Why haven't you found my Dad?

25:50.870 --> 25:53.190
- Your Dad's alive.
- What?

25:54.350 --> 25:56.430
If you want to see him,
come with me.

25:56.590 --> 25:59.110
But... Who are you?

25:59.270 --> 26:01.710
- Does it matter?
- I shouldn't just go.

26:03.910 --> 26:06.910
One word, I make the call, he dies.

26:08.110 --> 26:08.990
Move.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.270
Alexa?

26:16.630 --> 26:17.790
Alexa!

26:18.750 --> 26:20.430
Alexa!

26:20.590 --> 26:23.710
What are you doing here?
Where's she taken her? Who is she?

26:23.870 --> 26:25.710
- She works for Porter.
- You work for Porter!

26:25.870 --> 26:27.510
Not anymore.

26:27.670 --> 26:30.190
I know where they're going.

26:30.350 --> 26:32.790
Get in!
Come on, we're gonna lose them.

26:34.230 --> 26:36.350
- Get in.
- I've been calling you.

26:36.510 --> 26:38.870
- Where the hell have you been?
- I got your message.

26:51.070 --> 26:52.310
What is that?

27:01.110 --> 27:02.470
And this?

27:03.870 --> 27:05.310
Hm, Dad?

27:08.150 --> 27:09.110
Dad?

27:10.070 --> 27:11.430
Dad! Dad!

27:17.470 --> 27:20.270
They're what you were wearing
on that day.

27:22.430 --> 27:24.070
<i>Daniel!</i>

27:27.230 --> 27:28.710
You were so...

27:30.070 --> 27:31.470
destructive.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.270
When we'd argue...

27:39.950 --> 27:41.230
- <i>Daniel! Come back here!</i>
- <i>Ray!</i>

27:41.390 --> 27:43.910
<i>You'd get so upset...</i>

27:56.870 --> 27:58.350
Smashing things...

27:59.670 --> 28:01.190
<i>with that bat.</i>

28:07.390 --> 28:10.350
It was past midnight
when you got back.

28:11.630 --> 28:15.390
But you wouldn't say
where you'd been.

28:17.670 --> 28:20.910
You wouldn't say... anything.

28:26.350 --> 28:27.510
So...

28:29.790 --> 28:31.710
Where were you, Daniel?

28:34.670 --> 28:38.790
Where'd you go after you'd run out?

29:03.390 --> 29:04.710
Alexa.

29:06.150 --> 29:07.430
Do you remember me?

29:09.190 --> 29:11.630
I used to help out your mum.
Where's my dad?

29:12.310 --> 29:14.950
Oh, that is cold.

29:15.110 --> 29:16.630
Oh, no, your dad's dead.

29:26.990 --> 29:28.750
Bring her inside.

29:38.910 --> 29:41.230
If Porter gets what he wants,
he'll kill her.

29:41.390 --> 29:42.990
The memory stick.

29:43.550 --> 29:46.430
- How do you know about that?
- She told me everything.

29:48.950 --> 29:50.350
Get in there.

29:57.110 --> 29:59.870
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

30:00.030 --> 30:01.550
I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:08.950 --> 30:11.110
Who are you?
Why do you even care?

30:11.270 --> 30:13.110
It's just the kind of guys
that we are. OK?

30:13.270 --> 30:14.990
- Bullshit.
- Say that again.

30:15.150 --> 30:16.990
Says a wannabe pimp.

30:17.150 --> 30:19.510
Alexa is like a daughter to me.

30:20.030 --> 30:23.030
She's already got a dad
and his name's Kenton Marshall.

30:28.150 --> 30:31.310
Your mother tried to blackmail me
with information I owned.

30:32.150 --> 30:33.350
That's why she's dead.

30:42.590 --> 30:43.670
<i>Yeah, it's all there.</i>

30:43.830 --> 30:45.950
<i>Check the file details.</i>

30:46.110 --> 30:47.310
<i>She's made a copy.</i>

30:47.470 --> 30:50.310
And your daddy told us you had it.

30:51.630 --> 30:54.910
Before we killed him too.

30:55.990 --> 30:56.830
<i>Right,</i>

30:56.990 --> 30:59.190
I'll go around the front
and cause a diversion.

30:59.910 --> 31:02.390
Diversion?

31:06.230 --> 31:09.110
- Surely we have to call the police.
- There's no time.

31:09.270 --> 31:12.070
You've got to go over the fence
and through that door at the back.

31:12.230 --> 31:13.710
Find her and bring her out.

31:13.870 --> 31:16.750
The entry code's two-seven-six-nine.

31:16.910 --> 31:19.190
You got "two-seven". I've got "six-nine".

31:20.990 --> 31:22.630
Slade, come on.

31:24.150 --> 31:27.070
I've got a daughter just like you.

31:28.670 --> 31:30.550
She swears she doesn't smoke.

31:30.710 --> 31:33.510
- Ow.
- But I can smell it on her.

31:35.630 --> 31:37.470
Make sure it's all there.

31:49.310 --> 31:51.390
Oh, what is this guy,
a Bond villain?

31:52.190 --> 31:53.830
More like a footballer.

31:58.990 --> 32:00.230
Jesus.

32:06.190 --> 32:08.790
- Where have you been all this time?
- Come on.

32:09.310 --> 32:10.870
Slade. Shit.

32:11.910 --> 32:14.990
When did you become Bruce Willis?
This is ridiculous.

32:33.230 --> 32:34.470
It's encrypted.

32:36.830 --> 32:38.470
It would be a shame to hurt you.

32:41.350 --> 32:42.830
Oh, shit.

32:42.990 --> 32:46.630
- Mark, what were your two numbers?
- What do you mean, my two numbers?

32:49.070 --> 32:51.910
- Your numbers. What were they?
- I wasn't listening.

33:01.790 --> 33:03.790
Oh, shit: 69?

33:03.950 --> 33:05.750
No, I had 69.

33:05.910 --> 33:08.310
Remember?
I'd remember 69. It's funny.

33:10.070 --> 33:12.590
Tell me the encryption code!

33:13.550 --> 33:14.870
Slade, come on.

33:17.710 --> 33:19.470
Six-nine-two-seven.

33:21.990 --> 33:23.430
Oh, shit!

33:25.310 --> 33:26.310
What's going on?

33:30.710 --> 33:31.590
Ah...

33:32.670 --> 33:34.550
Two men coming through
the back door!

33:34.710 --> 33:36.470
She must have been followed.

33:36.630 --> 33:37.630
Shawn. Do you hear me?

33:38.550 --> 33:40.670
- Oh, shit.
- Other way round. Two-seven-six-nine.

33:41.910 --> 33:43.150
Two-seven-six-nine.

33:44.750 --> 33:47.470
Turn that bloody sound off!

33:50.510 --> 33:52.070
Holy shit!

33:52.790 --> 33:54.350
He's got an actual Batcave.

33:57.030 --> 33:58.030
Ow!

33:59.870 --> 34:01.790
Who are they? Look.

34:02.990 --> 34:04.790
What are we doing?

34:04.950 --> 34:08.350
We keep moving. We just hope
that Payne knows what he's doing.

34:30.270 --> 34:33.030
Who are they?

34:34.230 --> 34:35.150
I've got one, boss.

34:38.630 --> 34:41.070
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here for my girl.

34:46.750 --> 34:48.830
Why are you still here?
Go and help find the others.

34:52.710 --> 34:55.830
That was a gun.
What if they shot Payne?

34:57.790 --> 34:59.830
Then we find Alexa ourselves.
Come on.

35:08.310 --> 35:11.590
Look, you go that way. OK. Let's go.
Go, go, go, go. We'll be fine.

35:17.510 --> 35:18.750
Why are you in my house?

35:31.150 --> 35:33.470
What took you so long?

35:33.630 --> 35:35.830
Who are you with?

35:41.270 --> 35:43.510
- Who are you with?
- Got one more!

35:52.230 --> 35:53.790
- You?
- Who is he?

35:56.710 --> 35:58.310
He was poking around my office.

35:58.470 --> 36:01.750
What are you, hm?
Selena's boyfriend?

36:02.630 --> 36:04.110
Brother?

36:04.630 --> 36:06.230
It doesn't matter.

36:06.390 --> 36:08.030
Just let her go. OK?

36:09.870 --> 36:11.710
Do you want me
to call off the police?

36:11.870 --> 36:12.950
No. No need.

36:13.110 --> 36:14.950
They'll see I was acting
in self-defence.

36:17.030 --> 36:18.990
Two men break into my home...

36:20.190 --> 36:21.390
Armed.

36:23.230 --> 36:24.870
One of my men tries to stop them...

36:26.390 --> 36:27.470
and they killed him.

36:35.070 --> 36:37.150
Jeez! Oh my God...

36:37.310 --> 36:38.710
Hey.

36:38.870 --> 36:40.990
In the ensuing struggle,
I manage to disarm them

36:41.150 --> 36:43.990
and then kill them myself.
Unless you give me the code

36:44.150 --> 36:45.830
for the memory stick.

36:47.430 --> 36:49.070
It's your only way out.

36:49.230 --> 36:51.070
Please. Please.

36:51.230 --> 36:52.710
You see him?

36:53.510 --> 36:56.870
He almost tied your whore mother
to me by getting himself caught.

36:57.030 --> 36:59.310
That's how much
I want this to be over.

36:59.470 --> 37:02.710
So give me the codes.

37:06.310 --> 37:09.830
Listen to me, Alexa. Just...
Just give him the code.

37:10.510 --> 37:11.950
OK?

37:12.910 --> 37:15.230
Don't know it, Slade.

37:15.390 --> 37:16.830
No, it's fine.

37:17.390 --> 37:19.990
You've got no choice.
Just give him the code.

37:20.510 --> 37:23.470
- He's right, you know.
- It'll be fine.

37:25.830 --> 37:26.830
It's my birthday.

37:27.990 --> 37:30.270
It's my birthday.
It's zero-six-zero-seven.

37:47.830 --> 37:48.750
Now!

37:56.990 --> 37:58.590
Who did you send to kill Selena?

37:58.750 --> 38:01.430
My brother's DNA
was at the murder scene.

38:03.110 --> 38:04.510
Who did you send?

38:05.590 --> 38:06.990
Who did you send?

38:16.990 --> 38:19.110
- Oh, my God!
- It's all right.

38:19.270 --> 38:20.630
- Whoa.
- It's all right.

38:21.190 --> 38:23.150
It's all right. It's OK.

38:24.030 --> 38:25.910
- Oh, Jesus.
- You've got to go.

38:26.070 --> 38:27.670
- No. No.
- Yes.

38:27.830 --> 38:29.390
I'll wipe the CCTV.

38:29.870 --> 38:32.110
- You were never here.
- What about you? No.

38:32.270 --> 38:33.390
No.

38:34.550 --> 38:36.710
No. No. No, no, no.

38:36.870 --> 38:39.390
It's better if they get me.
Or they'll come after you.

38:40.510 --> 38:43.070
And that's not what we wanted
for your future.

38:43.230 --> 38:44.670
"We?"

38:48.350 --> 38:50.870
You helped... You helped my mum?

38:51.030 --> 38:53.710
You set it up with my mum
so I'd meet my dad?

38:54.230 --> 38:56.430
- No.
- Get her out of here.

38:56.590 --> 38:58.190
- No.
- Come on. Alexa, come on.

38:58.350 --> 39:01.030
- No, please! Please, please, please.
- Alexa, we have to go.

39:02.350 --> 39:04.830
Look... My name is Mark Wells.

39:04.990 --> 39:06.670
- I'm a solicitor.
- Mark!

39:06.830 --> 39:08.710
When you get to the police station,
call me.

39:08.870 --> 39:12.430
All right? I'll represent you.

39:20.510 --> 39:22.910
It's OK.
Everything's gonna be all right.

39:23.070 --> 39:25.310
How's it gonna be all right?

39:26.030 --> 39:27.390
Hm?

39:27.990 --> 39:31.310
Cause my mum's dead, my dad's dead
and the only other person

39:31.470 --> 39:33.670
who's ever cared about me
is going to prison.

39:37.630 --> 39:39.070
I'm sorry.

39:49.310 --> 39:51.070
Where are we going?

40:15.070 --> 40:16.230
It's over.

40:16.670 --> 40:18.990
Alexa's in the van.
You can go home now.

40:28.390 --> 40:30.550
This is Alexa. This is Laura.

40:30.710 --> 40:33.190
Hello. Can I give you a hug?

40:40.430 --> 40:42.310
We did good, Mark.

40:45.070 --> 40:47.510
You're gonna have to
tell me everything.

40:47.670 --> 40:48.750
OK.

40:55.510 --> 40:56.670
<i>Help!</i>

40:56.830 --> 40:59.230
<i>It all started with Alexa
coming into the shelter.</i>

40:59.390 --> 41:02.750
<i>She was terrified.
And she told me everything.</i>

41:02.910 --> 41:05.350
<i>The man in the yellow car
who had hurt her.</i>

41:05.510 --> 41:08.110
<i>About Porter. About her mother.</i>

41:08.910 --> 41:11.670
<i>Heard her father's message
about wanting to meet them.</i>

41:11.830 --> 41:13.830
<i>But these people,
Mark, they don't play nice.</i>

41:13.990 --> 41:16.190
<i>Kenton was walking into a trap.</i>

41:17.950 --> 41:20.830
<i>So I went to the hotel,
but I got there too late.</i>

41:20.990 --> 41:22.590
<i>I saw this guy park up.</i>

41:22.750 --> 41:26.310
<i>It was the same yellow car Alexa said
she saw and I knew it was him.</i>

41:27.150 --> 41:29.030
<i>So I followed him in.</i>

41:47.190 --> 41:49.270
<i>I searched the body,
found his phone</i>

41:49.430 --> 41:51.830
<i>and texted Porter
that the job had been done</i>

41:51.990 --> 41:54.190
<i>so they'd think Kenton was dead</i>

41:54.350 --> 41:56.510
<i>and then saved his number
onto my phone.</i>

41:56.670 --> 41:57.910
<i>I wrapped the body up</i>

41:59.590 --> 42:01.430
<i>and I moved his car around the back.</i>

42:02.910 --> 42:05.030
<i>And I waited until dark
to get the body out.</i>

42:06.750 --> 42:08.030
<i>And then I hid Kenton</i>

42:08.190 --> 42:09.430
<i>in a safe house,</i>

42:09.590 --> 42:11.310
<i>which is when Laura's son came to you</i>

42:11.470 --> 42:12.470
<i>and you got involved.</i>

42:14.470 --> 42:15.470
<i>Payne attacked you.</i>

42:15.630 --> 42:18.230
<i>We tracked him down to Porter & Starr.</i>

42:18.390 --> 42:20.070
<i>The same company Selena worked for.</i>

42:21.110 --> 42:23.910
<i>I saw him in there with Porter.
They were arguing.</i>

42:24.070 --> 42:26.030
<i>And now I know it was over Alexa.</i>

42:26.790 --> 42:29.110
<i>And Porter wanted
to use her in his scams.</i>

42:29.270 --> 42:30.750
<i>She's a child.</i>

42:30.910 --> 42:33.550
<i>Payne was trying to protect her.</i>

42:39.230 --> 42:41.070
And the rest you know.

42:44.150 --> 42:45.790
You knew about the whole thing.

42:45.950 --> 42:49.310
You let me follow this trail
and you knew where it was gonna lead.

42:49.470 --> 42:51.790
You had all the answers
and you pretended that you didn't.

42:51.950 --> 42:53.270
Why would you do that?

42:57.750 --> 42:59.190
<i>Who did you send?</i>

43:01.550 --> 43:05.190
I saw you with Porter then
and you wanted to kill him.

43:08.190 --> 43:10.710
And that's what happens, Mark.

43:10.870 --> 43:12.830
OK? And I can't...

43:14.310 --> 43:16.110
I don't want you becoming me.

43:19.030 --> 43:21.790
- What does that mean?
- It means I'm not gonna lose you. OK?

43:21.950 --> 43:22.910
I can't.

43:41.750 --> 43:43.990
You all right?

43:46.430 --> 43:48.110
Yeah, I'm OK.

43:56.870 --> 43:59.750
Slade, you've killed.
You've killed somebody.

44:01.830 --> 44:03.630
- And, Slade...
- Shh...

44:04.070 --> 44:05.830
You killed someone.

44:12.510 --> 44:16.230
And all this seems to have been
since Jesse's name came back up.

44:18.270 --> 44:21.190
It just seems to be death
and murder, and it's just...

44:21.710 --> 44:23.390
I'm tired, man.

44:24.590 --> 44:25.790
I know.

44:30.030 --> 44:31.910
And if all this isn't enough...

44:33.830 --> 44:35.590
<i>The studio
where the girls were kept...</i>

44:38.950 --> 44:41.830
They found Jesse's DNA
at Newman's crime scene.

44:47.990 --> 44:49.910
Maybe Jesse killed Newman.

44:54.270 --> 44:55.790
That's impossible.

44:57.550 --> 44:59.190
How do you know?

45:00.550 --> 45:02.030
Because I killed Newman.
