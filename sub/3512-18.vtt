00:24.735 --> 00:26.747
Hey, so, you want to
go to Lincoln Center

00:26.781 --> 00:27.881
and hear some jazz tonight?

00:27.916 --> 00:29.450
Wynton Marsalis is playing.

00:29.485 --> 00:30.851
Oh, I would love to, but I can't.

00:30.885 --> 00:33.020
I've got that dinner with
my old friend from high school.

00:33.054 --> 00:35.522
You don't sound very thrilled
about going.

00:35.556 --> 00:36.724
Yeah, you know, it's just

00:36.758 --> 00:38.391
Carly's always been really competitive,

00:38.426 --> 00:41.561
talking about her fabulous life nonstop.

00:41.596 --> 00:42.963
I bet no one's basing a character

00:42.998 --> 00:44.559
in their best-selling mysteries on her.

00:44.565 --> 00:47.200
True, but the last time I talked to her,

00:47.235 --> 00:49.369
she had just came back
from the French Riviera

00:49.403 --> 00:51.704
with a count that she met in Monaco.

00:51.739 --> 00:53.640
And now I hear she's married

00:53.674 --> 00:55.642
to some big-shot, European businessman

00:55.676 --> 00:57.310
that she met on a yoga retreat,

00:57.345 --> 00:59.312
and she's embraced the spiritual life.

00:59.347 --> 01:01.181
Well, you want me to tag along

01:01.215 --> 01:04.384
and regale her with tales
of our crime-solving adventures?

01:04.418 --> 01:06.319
Definitely not.
You are exactly her type.

01:06.354 --> 01:08.821
And the last thing I need
is to watch someone from my past

01:08.856 --> 01:10.322
trying to seduce my fiancÃ©

01:10.357 --> 01:12.291
while talking about the goddess
that lives in her hoo-ha.

01:13.593 --> 01:15.962
She did ask for a signed book, though.

01:15.996 --> 01:17.830
Who did? Carly or the goddess?

01:19.033 --> 01:20.099
Beckett.

01:20.134 --> 01:21.433
Please, Castle, you have to promise me

01:21.468 --> 01:23.102
if you don't hear from me by 10:00,

01:23.137 --> 01:24.970
you will call me
and get me out of there.

01:25.004 --> 01:26.505
I am setting an alarm right now.

01:26.540 --> 01:28.940
See, this is what having
a partner in life is all about.

01:28.975 --> 01:30.176
Hey, guys.

01:30.210 --> 01:32.244
So, I hope you're up
for a pretty strange one.

01:32.279 --> 01:34.780
Warehouse worker
found our vic this morning.

01:34.814 --> 01:37.383
Perlmutter said
that she died around 3:00 A.M.

01:37.417 --> 01:40.018
Her passport says that her name
is Jade Yamaya.

01:40.053 --> 01:41.019
Passport? She a tourist?

01:41.054 --> 01:42.854
No, she's a Japanese citizen.

01:42.889 --> 01:45.130
Stamp indicates she's been
in the country for six months.

01:45.158 --> 01:47.059
Okay, we have to notify
the Japanese consulate.

01:47.093 --> 01:48.760
- I'll put in a call.
- Thanks.

01:50.396 --> 01:52.864
What is she doing
down here all dressed up?

01:52.899 --> 01:54.700
There's no night life in this area.

01:54.734 --> 01:56.001
And her clothes are higher-end.

01:56.035 --> 01:57.555
I'm guessing she's not a working girl.

01:57.570 --> 01:59.136
Looks like she was stabbed with a knife.

01:59.171 --> 02:00.971
Mm.

02:01.006 --> 02:02.640
To the untrained eye, perhaps.

02:02.675 --> 02:05.009
But what you don't know
about post-mortem analysis

02:05.043 --> 02:07.545
could fill a book, Mr. Castle.

02:07.580 --> 02:10.381
I... in fact, it has. Numerous times.

02:10.416 --> 02:12.550
Fine. So it was not a knife.

02:12.585 --> 02:14.118
Ah, wrong again. It <i>was</i> a knife.

02:14.152 --> 02:18.789
But "stabbed" implies the blade
was <i>thrust</i> into the victim,

02:18.824 --> 02:21.391
whereas this wound was produced

02:21.426 --> 02:23.627
by it being <i>hurled</i> into her chest.

02:23.661 --> 02:25.029
What is this, "Last of the Mohicans"?

02:25.063 --> 02:26.296
What kind of knife is it?

02:26.331 --> 02:28.966
Uh, one with a hilt
that matches these small bruises

02:29.000 --> 02:30.701
on either side of the wound.

02:30.735 --> 02:32.636
It killed her instantly,

02:32.670 --> 02:34.638
severing the left anterior
descending artery.

02:34.672 --> 02:36.707
Okay, so, either that's
the luckiest knife toss

02:36.741 --> 02:38.709
in the world...

02:38.743 --> 02:40.711
Or she was killed
by a circus knife thrower.

02:40.745 --> 02:42.412
Like the Great Throwdini.

02:44.115 --> 02:46.435
Ryan, do we have any witnesses
that saw the Great Throwdini

02:46.450 --> 02:48.017
or anyone else in the area?

02:48.052 --> 02:50.086
Uh... no, not so far.

02:50.121 --> 02:53.256
But we did find this
next to our dead body.

02:53.290 --> 02:55.058
If it's not Jade's,
it might be our killer's.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.393
- What is it?
- It's a drop key.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.461
Yeah, I used to scavenge stuff like this

02:58.495 --> 02:59.796
from old buildings when I was a kid.

02:59.830 --> 03:01.564
Yeah, buildings would keep them on hand

03:01.598 --> 03:03.232
to, uh, manually open elevator doors,

03:03.267 --> 03:04.734
something like that,
in case of an emergency.

03:04.768 --> 03:07.403
I'll have tech try to trace it
and see what it's made for.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.771
Long shot, but you never know.

03:08.805 --> 03:10.740
And what about her purse?
Is there any contact information

03:10.774 --> 03:13.542
or an address of where she was staying?

03:13.577 --> 03:14.710
No, but I did look through her cell.

03:14.745 --> 03:15.944
Based on her calls and texts,

03:15.979 --> 03:17.747
she had a boyfriend named Dean Bedford.

03:19.548 --> 03:22.851
I can't believe Jade is gone.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.888
Dean, do you have any idea

03:25.922 --> 03:28.456
- why she would be in the warehouse
district? - No.

03:28.491 --> 03:30.392
She told me she was going to rehearsals

03:30.426 --> 03:32.194
and then straight back to the dorms.

03:32.228 --> 03:33.561
So she was a student?

03:33.596 --> 03:36.431
She was a dancer at the
New York Ballet Conservatory.

03:36.465 --> 03:38.466
She lived there, too.

03:38.501 --> 03:40.201
Yeah, we're patrons of the Conservatory.

03:40.235 --> 03:42.870
That's where she and Dean met.

03:42.905 --> 03:45.707
A professional ballet
company is pretty competitive...

03:45.741 --> 03:47.609
did she have problems with anyone there?

03:47.643 --> 03:49.611
Uh, no. Just the usual jealousy.

03:49.645 --> 03:51.446
She rose up the ranks pretty fast.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.580
Any issues with anyone back in Japan?

03:53.615 --> 03:55.817
She didn't talk much
about her life there.

03:55.851 --> 03:58.385
Um... it's like she wanted
a fresh start.

03:58.420 --> 03:59.820
I have to tell her family.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.555
I don't... I don't even know
how to reach them.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.991
Well, the consulate
will take care of that.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.293
Right now, the best way for you to help

04:05.327 --> 04:08.395
is to tell us what you know about Jade.

04:08.430 --> 04:09.910
Now, we found this at the crime scene.

04:09.931 --> 04:11.131
Do you recognize it?

04:11.165 --> 04:13.667
No, I've never seen that before.

04:13.702 --> 04:16.937
Dean, how well did you know Jade?

04:16.971 --> 04:19.606
Did she socialize with other people?

04:19.641 --> 04:22.409
No, she was pretty focused. Why?

04:22.444 --> 04:24.110
Well, it's just, when we found her,

04:24.145 --> 04:25.445
she was dressed to go out.

04:25.479 --> 04:28.281
Out?

04:28.316 --> 04:30.116
If she was
meeting someone on the sly

04:30.151 --> 04:32.118
it didn't show up in her phone records.

04:32.153 --> 04:35.288
Pretty much every call she made
was to Dean and the ballet.

04:35.323 --> 04:36.589
Well, that's where
she lived and trained,

04:36.623 --> 04:38.691
so maybe someone there knows
why she went out last night.

04:38.726 --> 04:40.994
Time to go to the ballet.

04:41.028 --> 04:42.428
Uh, well, you might want to
postpone your trip

04:42.463 --> 04:43.830
when you hear this.

04:43.864 --> 04:46.131
- Did you get a lead on the drop key?
- More than a lead.

04:46.166 --> 04:49.134
Tech confirmed that the key
was used to open an elevator.

04:49.169 --> 04:50.336
Not only that, but they were

04:50.371 --> 04:53.305
able to get a name
off the brass... Marigold.

04:53.340 --> 04:56.141
- As in the flower?
- No, as in the Marigold Cookie Company.

04:56.176 --> 04:57.656
The factory's been shut down for years

04:57.678 --> 04:59.778
and the building is abandoned,
but the abandoned building

04:59.812 --> 05:01.780
is two blocks from
where Jade's body was found.

05:14.394 --> 05:18.697
This place is seriously creepy
for a cookie factory.

05:18.731 --> 05:21.366
Maybe the killer lured Jade here
and she escaped,

05:21.401 --> 05:24.335
but she was unable to outrun
the flying dagger of doom.

05:24.370 --> 05:26.170
That doesn't make any sense, Castle.

05:26.205 --> 05:27.171
How so?

05:27.206 --> 05:30.842
Because look at this place. It's filthy.

05:30.877 --> 05:33.344
There's no way Jade
would set foot in here,

05:33.379 --> 05:35.513
not with the clothes
that she was wearing.

05:35.547 --> 05:38.349
Here's something else
that doesn't make sense...

05:38.384 --> 05:40.184
there's no electricity.

05:40.219 --> 05:41.752
Why would the killer
have a key to an elevator

05:41.787 --> 05:43.948
- if there's no power to make it work?
- Let's go find out.

05:52.898 --> 05:55.399
There's another room back here.

06:14.652 --> 06:17.787
This must be his lair.

06:17.822 --> 06:21.290
Yeah, and that's some kind of a shrine.

06:21.325 --> 06:23.192
A shrine to murder.

06:23.226 --> 06:26.028
Check this out.

06:26.063 --> 06:28.230
The design of this hilt

06:28.265 --> 06:29.532
matches the bruises we saw.

06:29.567 --> 06:31.534
And I'm betting there's
traces of blood on here, too.

06:33.236 --> 06:34.838
Someone's here.

06:51.088 --> 06:53.822
Beckett?

06:53.857 --> 06:56.658
Castle, what happened?

06:56.693 --> 06:57.793
A...

06:57.827 --> 07:01.930
ninja... stole the murder weapon.

07:07.971 --> 07:10.671
Yeah.

07:10.706 --> 07:15.706
Castle 6x18 - The Way of the Ninja
Original air date March 17, 2014

07:15.731 --> 07:20.731
Sync and corrections by atrn97g
for www.addic7ed.com

07:22.859 --> 07:26.025
You were attacked by a ninja,
and you witnessed it?

07:26.081 --> 07:28.311
Uh, no, sir. Not exactly.

07:28.346 --> 07:30.681
Because he made a sound
and drew her away.

07:30.715 --> 07:33.049
Ninjas are masters
of the surprise attack.

07:33.084 --> 07:35.552
I... in any case, we think
that he's our killer because

07:35.587 --> 07:36.553
the knife that he took from Castle

07:36.588 --> 07:37.988
appears to be our murder weapon.

07:38.022 --> 07:41.724
- So what you're saying is that...
- Our killer is a ninja.

07:41.759 --> 07:45.195
Or he is just an athletic person
with a hooded track suit.

07:45.229 --> 07:48.064
Yeah, who disappeared
in a puff of smoke.

07:48.099 --> 07:49.766
Yes, which I could do
if I had a smoke bomb.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.067
Whatever the man is,

07:51.102 --> 07:54.070
do you have any sense as to why
he would kill Jade Yamaya?

07:54.105 --> 07:55.738
No, sir. We don't have motive yet.

07:55.773 --> 07:57.339
But we're looking into
the objects on the shrine

07:57.374 --> 07:58.875
just in case they're connected
to our victim.

07:58.909 --> 08:00.777
Where are we on I.D.ing the suspect?

08:00.811 --> 08:02.077
There's no security video

08:02.112 --> 08:04.213
either from the building
or the street cams...

08:04.247 --> 08:06.382
not that any self-respecting
ninja would be caught on video.

08:06.417 --> 08:09.184
But CSU is sweeping the place
for prints, for evidence.

08:09.219 --> 08:11.621
We've also got a unit
sitting on the building,

08:11.655 --> 08:13.289
on the off chance that he returns.

08:14.424 --> 08:16.358
Excuse me, sir. Uh, detective Beckett,

08:16.393 --> 08:18.360
this is consulate officer Amaya Tagami.

08:18.395 --> 08:20.029
I came as soon as I could.

08:21.064 --> 08:23.865
Jade Yamaya's death is a terrible loss,

08:23.900 --> 08:25.700
and the Ambassador has asked me
to keep him informed

08:25.735 --> 08:27.303
of your progress on this case.

08:27.337 --> 08:29.104
I spoke to Jade's parents in Kyoto,

08:29.139 --> 08:31.706
and they, too, are anxious for news.

08:31.741 --> 08:33.207
All we know is that the attacker

08:33.241 --> 08:34.643
may have a connection to Japan.

08:34.677 --> 08:37.813
Now, did Jade's parents say
if she had any enemies?

08:37.847 --> 08:41.149
No. The truth is, they hadn't
spoken to her in weeks.

08:41.183 --> 08:43.485
Her moving here caused a bit of a rift.

08:43.519 --> 08:44.719
Why <i>did</i> she move?

08:44.754 --> 08:47.088
Was she trying to get away
from someone? Or something?

08:47.122 --> 08:48.356
I don't think so.

08:48.390 --> 08:51.059
They told me she came here
for her ballet career.

08:51.093 --> 08:53.061
How would I go about talking to them?

08:53.095 --> 08:54.562
I'm afraid they don't speak English,

08:54.596 --> 08:57.565
but I'm happy to pass along
any questions you have.

08:57.599 --> 08:58.899
Yeah, thanks.
I might take you up on that.

08:58.934 --> 09:00.435
But in the meantime,

09:00.469 --> 09:02.603
could you tell us what this means?

09:02.637 --> 09:05.305
Uh, this kanji is Izanami,

09:05.340 --> 09:07.808
shinto goddess of creation and death.

09:07.843 --> 09:10.478
Now, could it have
any sinister connotations?

09:10.512 --> 09:13.747
Might it be found
in the lair of, say, a ninja?

09:13.782 --> 09:16.083
No, uh...

09:16.117 --> 09:18.251
this is, uh, very common.

09:18.286 --> 09:21.088
Uh, people use it
to honor their ancestors.

09:21.122 --> 09:22.755
Where did you find this?

09:22.790 --> 09:25.825
In a room where we believe
our killer spent time.

09:25.860 --> 09:28.495
Well, I can assure you he's not a ninja.

09:28.529 --> 09:32.165
There are no such things
as ninjas anymore.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.134
What does she know, anyway?

09:34.168 --> 09:36.669
I bet she's never even seen
"Ninja III: The Domination."

09:36.704 --> 09:39.005
Yeah, no, I mean,
she only comes from the country

09:39.039 --> 09:40.540
that created the mythology.

09:40.574 --> 09:43.710
Which does not make her an expert.

09:43.744 --> 09:46.513
Our victim was killed ninja-style

09:46.547 --> 09:48.708
from a... a killer who had some
kind of mysterious shrine.

09:48.716 --> 09:51.350
I swear she just said
that it wasn't <i>that</i> mysterious.

09:51.385 --> 09:53.119
Yeah, about that shrine...

09:53.153 --> 09:54.820
CSU didn't find
any prints on it anywhere,

09:54.854 --> 09:56.522
or anywhere else at the lair.

09:56.556 --> 09:58.024
The place was wiped.

09:58.058 --> 10:00.592
Because ninjas never leave a trace.

10:00.627 --> 10:01.960
I know what I saw.

10:01.995 --> 10:05.297
You should have seen the way he moved...

10:05.332 --> 10:07.466
the athleticism, the grace, the agility.

10:07.501 --> 10:08.800
- It was like a...
- Ballet dancer.

10:08.835 --> 10:10.168
N... no.

10:10.202 --> 10:11.537
Yeah, no, actually,

10:11.571 --> 10:13.371
a ballet dancer <i>could</i> move
like our alleged ninja did.

10:13.406 --> 10:15.206
Only now we got motive.

10:15.241 --> 10:16.307
I talked to the dancers

10:16.342 --> 10:17.643
who lived with Jade back at the dorms.

10:17.677 --> 10:18.877
Apparently,
there was some major bad blood

10:18.912 --> 10:22.180
between her and a male dancer
named Lee Tong.

10:22.214 --> 10:23.214
Man!

10:23.249 --> 10:25.883
Yeah, but it can't be a ballet dancer.

10:27.286 --> 10:29.754
Because it would just be
such a huge letdown.

10:29.788 --> 10:30.988
Of course.

10:31.023 --> 10:33.691
We can't let facts
get in the way of a good story.

10:33.725 --> 10:36.094
What do you mean by "bad blood"?

10:36.128 --> 10:37.728
It turns out that Lee
had a thing for Jade,

10:37.763 --> 10:38.896
but she just didn't feel the same way.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.398
And then they both got cast
in "Madame Butterfly,"

10:40.433 --> 10:41.999
where they had to play lovers.

10:42.034 --> 10:43.333
Rehearsals turned
into screaming matches.

10:43.368 --> 10:44.669
And then yesterday,
one of the other dancers

10:44.703 --> 10:46.671
overheard Lee threatening to kill Jade.

10:46.705 --> 10:48.039
And he has the skills to do it.

10:48.073 --> 10:50.207
You mean like he's got...

10:50.241 --> 10:51.709
martial-arts training?

10:51.743 --> 10:54.078
Yeah. Black belts in karate and escrima.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.213
- Where was he last night?
- Not at rehearsal.

10:56.247 --> 10:57.582
He and Jade both left early.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.249
In fact, he was out all night long.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.818
He didn't return back to the
dorms till after she was dead.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.423
Okay, I'm...

11:06.458 --> 11:08.959
warming to this idea.
I.. I... I think it was him.

11:08.993 --> 11:12.396
Even though he's a ballet dancer
and not a ninja?

11:12.430 --> 11:13.530
He could be both.

11:13.565 --> 11:16.866
And... being a dancer
could just be his cover.

11:16.901 --> 11:19.936
And that way, the lair
could be like his batcave.

11:19.971 --> 11:24.207
- And somehow he lured Jade there
for a little private time? - Right.

11:24.241 --> 11:27.210
But she rejected him, fled,
he killed her in a jealous rage.

11:27.244 --> 11:28.712
Hmm, and here I thought ninjas

11:28.746 --> 11:30.480
had total mastery of their emotions.

11:30.514 --> 11:32.982
Look, I'm not claiming
to have all the answers... yet.

11:33.016 --> 11:35.318
But just look at that guy...

11:35.352 --> 11:37.786
he's a ninja through and through.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.124
And I'm gonna prove it.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.625
How?

11:42.659 --> 11:44.293
You'll see.

11:46.163 --> 11:50.298
Mr. Tong, I'm detective Beckett.
This is Mr. Castle.

11:50.333 --> 11:53.301
Oh, I believe we've already met.

11:53.336 --> 11:55.237
Earlier today, in fact.

11:55.271 --> 11:57.906
I don't think so. Why am I here?

11:57.941 --> 11:59.574
We're investigating Jade Yamaya's death,

11:59.609 --> 12:01.243
and we need to ask you a few questions.

12:01.277 --> 12:02.811
Now, I understand that the two of you

12:02.846 --> 12:04.513
had a rehearsal scheduled
for last night?

12:04.547 --> 12:06.681
Yeah. But then she bailed on me.

12:06.715 --> 12:08.416
And where did you go afterwards?

12:08.451 --> 12:10.118
To an Art-House Theater downtown.

12:10.153 --> 12:12.120
They were doing
a Kurosawa retrospective.

12:12.155 --> 12:13.755
Can anyone corroborate that?

12:13.789 --> 12:15.323
I doubt it. Why?

12:15.358 --> 12:18.826
Because you didn't return
to your dorm until 4:00 A.M.

12:18.861 --> 12:22.530
That's exactly one hour
after Jade was murdered.

12:22.564 --> 12:24.632
Wait, you think I killed Jade?

12:24.667 --> 12:26.000
People heard you threatening her.

12:26.035 --> 12:28.269
I didn't mean it. I was just frustrated.

12:28.303 --> 12:30.772
She kept missing rehearsals,
showing up distracted.

12:30.806 --> 12:34.042
Look, if she fumbles a lift,
<i>I'm</i> the one who blows a knee.

12:34.076 --> 12:36.377
But that's not all it was, was it?

12:36.411 --> 12:39.680
You were pushing Jade for
a more intimate relationship.

12:39.714 --> 12:42.015
Not once I got to know her.

12:42.050 --> 12:44.351
She wasn't as serious
about her craft as I thought,

12:44.386 --> 12:46.620
and I just got sick of dealing with her.

12:46.655 --> 12:49.089
But it all got way easier the
second I knew she was leaving.

12:53.061 --> 12:54.194
What are you doing?

12:54.228 --> 12:56.129
It's not him. A ninja
would have caught the cup.

12:56.164 --> 12:57.463
I'm not a ninja.

12:57.498 --> 12:58.832
Obviously.

12:58.866 --> 13:02.669
And I'm Korean, not Japanese.
Way to racially profile.

13:02.704 --> 13:05.172
What do you mean that Jade was leaving?

13:05.206 --> 13:07.674
Every night during rehearsal,
she would cut out at 8:00,

13:07.709 --> 13:09.076
run to the bodega,
and use the pay phone.

13:09.110 --> 13:10.310
Who was she calling?

13:10.344 --> 13:11.678
I have no idea.

13:11.712 --> 13:13.746
But I finally lit into her
about it last night.

13:13.780 --> 13:15.848
That's when she told me she
was quitting the Ballet Company.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.684
- Then she left.
- Where did she go?

13:17.718 --> 13:19.352
I don't know.

13:19.386 --> 13:21.254
She changed into party clothes
and took off.

13:21.288 --> 13:24.857
That's the last I saw of her, I swear.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.593
Jade was quitting the ballet?

13:27.627 --> 13:29.595
She worked and trained all her life

13:29.629 --> 13:31.764
to come here and dance at the NYBC,

13:31.798 --> 13:34.533
and suddenly she's gonna give it all up?

13:34.567 --> 13:35.901
What could possibly happen

13:35.936 --> 13:37.937
to suddenly make her want to do that?

13:37.971 --> 13:40.572
And why aren't you talking, Beckett?

13:40.607 --> 13:42.208
You're not still mad at me
about the cup.

13:42.209 --> 13:43.609
I'm not?

13:43.643 --> 13:46.612
Well, Lee's story checks out.

13:46.646 --> 13:47.946
Usher at the movie theater

13:47.980 --> 13:50.215
recalls him sleeping through
"Dersu Uzala."

13:50.250 --> 13:51.583
Blasphemy.

13:51.618 --> 13:53.118
In any case, records
from the bodega pay phone

13:53.152 --> 13:54.519
back up Lee's story...

13:54.554 --> 13:57.489
every night at 8:00, calls
were made to the same number,

13:57.523 --> 13:58.990
a place called Miyago.

13:59.024 --> 14:01.926
It's a tea-import company not
far from where Jade was killed.

14:01.961 --> 14:03.161
I asked her boyfriend.

14:03.195 --> 14:04.695
He didn't know anything
about it. Yes, Castle?

14:04.730 --> 14:07.265
Why would Jade be calling a
tea-import company every night?

14:07.299 --> 14:10.168
My guess would be the same
reason she was using a pay phone

14:10.202 --> 14:12.771
instead of her cell...
something shady was going on.

14:12.805 --> 14:16.074
We need to check it out.
I should cancel my plans.

14:16.108 --> 14:17.608
Oh, no. Hey, we got this.

14:17.643 --> 14:19.310
Yeah, wouldn't want you
to cancel your dinner plans

14:19.344 --> 14:22.146
with Carly and the goddess.

14:22.180 --> 14:24.715
Just make sure you call me at 10:00.

14:27.786 --> 14:31.422
This does not look like
a tea-import company.

14:31.456 --> 14:33.056
So what is this place?

14:33.091 --> 14:36.093
And why would Jade be calling here?

14:36.127 --> 14:37.427
Check it out.

14:37.461 --> 14:42.199
What's a limo doing
in the warehouse district?

14:46.004 --> 14:48.906
This is definitely
not a tea-import company.

14:48.940 --> 14:51.274
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

14:52.376 --> 14:54.177
Um...

14:54.211 --> 14:58.147
Hey, guys. You, um...
you think that's wise?

14:58.182 --> 15:01.318
I mean, we really have no idea
what's behind that door.

15:01.352 --> 15:02.485
There's only three of us.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.854
- And two of us are cops.
- Yeah.

15:07.390 --> 15:09.325
It's locked.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.164
Oh.

15:43.159 --> 15:45.626
Well, if this is a tea company,
I think I want a cup.

15:55.562 --> 15:57.437
What is this place?
A geisha house?

15:57.469 --> 15:59.404
No.
It is a Japanese hostess bar,

15:59.438 --> 16:02.073
the modern-day equivalent.

16:02.107 --> 16:03.941
I've been to a few of these
in Tokyo, on a book tour.

16:03.975 --> 16:05.710
I bet you have.

16:05.744 --> 16:08.112
It's all a perfectly acceptable
part of doing business

16:08.146 --> 16:09.914
- in the Japanese culture.
- And the girls?

16:09.948 --> 16:11.481
Uh, they work for the club.

16:11.516 --> 16:13.077
They flirt, they get you to buy drinks,

16:13.085 --> 16:14.351
just keep things generally fun.

16:14.385 --> 16:16.187
No, no, no, the dresses
that they're wearing...

16:16.221 --> 16:18.221
the same ones that Jade had on
when she was killed.

16:18.223 --> 16:19.623
She must have been
working here that night.

16:19.657 --> 16:21.125
Most of these girls
are doing it for the money.

16:21.159 --> 16:23.793
Jade had a dream job
and a wealthy boyfriend.

16:23.828 --> 16:25.962
Why would she be working
in a Japanese hostess club?

16:25.996 --> 16:27.297
I don't know.

16:27.332 --> 16:29.633
But if this place had anything
to do with her death,

16:29.667 --> 16:32.636
- no one's gonna talk to us if they
so much as smell a badge. - Mm.

16:32.670 --> 16:35.405
Well, then, tonight we are not cops.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.674
We are just upscale gentlemen
looking for a good time.

16:37.709 --> 16:39.109
And if we play our cards right,

16:39.143 --> 16:42.946
we'll pick up some information
along the way.

16:42.980 --> 16:46.716
- Hello.
- Hello.

16:46.751 --> 16:49.585
Konnichiwa. And welcome to Miyago.

16:49.620 --> 16:52.088
May I offer you a table?

16:52.123 --> 16:54.357
Your very best.

16:54.391 --> 16:57.426
Domo. Table seven.

16:57.461 --> 16:59.495
Take that for me? Perfect.

17:01.064 --> 17:03.299
All right. Oh.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.468
So, is this your first time at Miyago?

17:05.502 --> 17:07.136
- Yes.
- No.

17:07.170 --> 17:09.571
Um... well, he and I
have been here before,

17:09.606 --> 17:11.473
but, um... I'm married.

17:11.507 --> 17:13.308
That's okay. Most of the guys here are.

17:14.477 --> 17:16.711
Uh, yeah, but I'm <i>really</i> married. Eh.

17:16.746 --> 17:18.981
- Oh, here we go.
- Yeah.

17:19.015 --> 17:21.784
Here you are.

17:21.818 --> 17:24.286
Oh.

17:24.319 --> 17:25.921
It's nicer over there.

17:25.954 --> 17:27.756
You know, the last time we were here,

17:27.790 --> 17:29.157
there was that one girl...

17:29.191 --> 17:31.259
um... with the short haircut,
like from "Pulp Fiction."

17:31.294 --> 17:33.461
You mean Jade.

17:33.496 --> 17:35.129
Jade, yes. Jade.

17:35.164 --> 17:37.899
So have you girls
seen her around lately?

17:39.335 --> 17:43.471
Um... well, see, w... what my friend
isn't telling you

17:43.506 --> 17:45.639
is that he actually
had a little crush on Jade.

17:45.674 --> 17:46.808
Mm.

17:46.842 --> 17:48.309
- It was just...
- Aww.

17:48.343 --> 17:50.011
Well...

17:50.045 --> 17:53.014
I'll make you forget all about her.

17:54.216 --> 17:56.017
You want to buy some private time?

17:56.051 --> 17:58.652
Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine right here.

17:58.687 --> 18:02.356
I don't think you are.
Not if you're asking about Jade.

18:03.792 --> 18:05.926
Are you sure you don't
want to buy some private time?

18:05.960 --> 18:09.630
Yes, I <i>do</i> want to buy some private time.

18:09.664 --> 18:11.832
Um, hey, Castle, where you going?

18:11.866 --> 18:14.234
Uh, just gonna go do
what we came here for.

18:14.268 --> 18:17.037
You guys cover me. Entertain
these beautiful ladies.

18:17.071 --> 18:18.338
What's he doing?

18:25.412 --> 18:27.180
Oh, oh! Um... uh, wait a minute.

18:27.215 --> 18:28.949
I'm flattered, but I really...

18:28.983 --> 18:31.017
Play the part or I'll get in trouble.

18:31.052 --> 18:32.518
Right, right.

18:32.553 --> 18:34.520
Okay.

18:34.555 --> 18:35.755
Why are you asking about Jade?

18:35.789 --> 18:37.069
You're not one of her customers.

18:37.090 --> 18:39.191
No. No, I'm, uh, a friend.

18:39.226 --> 18:40.526
Is she okay?

18:41.829 --> 18:42.995
Um...

18:44.832 --> 18:45.965
She's dead.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.801
I knew it.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.970
I knew when she didn't come in tonight.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.471
They got to her.

18:52.505 --> 18:53.973
Who?

18:54.007 --> 18:56.308
Hey. Who got to her?

18:56.343 --> 18:58.410
Look, I tried to warn her,
but she wouldn't stop.

18:58.444 --> 19:00.545
Stop what?

19:01.714 --> 19:04.583
Sorry.

19:04.617 --> 19:06.551
I have to call...

19:06.586 --> 19:08.520
In a minute.

19:08.554 --> 19:09.855
She wouldn't stop what?

19:09.889 --> 19:12.991
- What the hell is he doing back there?
- I don't know.

19:13.025 --> 19:14.526
Hey, you know what, ladies? Um...

19:14.560 --> 19:17.028
I don't really like this sake.

19:17.062 --> 19:18.497
Do you think maybe
we could get another bottle?

19:18.531 --> 19:20.265
Something better?

19:20.299 --> 19:21.266
- More expensive?
- Mm.

19:21.300 --> 19:22.868
I like the way you think.

19:25.304 --> 19:27.238
Be right back.

19:27.273 --> 19:29.840
All right, hon. I'll be right here.

19:31.710 --> 19:35.513
Some of these businessmen
look a little shady.

19:35.547 --> 19:38.783
Look, check it out.
I see tattoos, scars.

19:38.817 --> 19:41.419
Why don't you take a lap around

19:41.453 --> 19:42.586
and see if anyone looks familiar?

19:42.621 --> 19:45.423
I'll stay here
and... entertain the ladies.

19:45.457 --> 19:46.791
All right.

19:53.097 --> 19:55.866
Yeah, let's do karaoke. It'll be fun.

19:55.901 --> 20:00.070
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
It... it will be? Okay. Really?

20:00.104 --> 20:01.238
- Um...
- Hey!

20:01.272 --> 20:02.306
Hey.

20:05.310 --> 20:07.777
Ever since she started here,

20:07.812 --> 20:09.779
Jade would always flirt
with this one client...

20:09.814 --> 20:10.948
a regular.

20:10.982 --> 20:12.849
The girls say he has a violent streak.

20:12.883 --> 20:15.217
I told her to stay away,
but she wouldn't listen.

20:15.252 --> 20:17.587
It's like she was targeting him.

20:17.621 --> 20:19.055
And this client, what's his name?

20:19.089 --> 20:21.390
We only know him as Mr. Saito.

20:21.425 --> 20:22.725
But he must be important,

20:22.760 --> 20:24.627
because lots of people
are scared of him.

20:24.662 --> 20:26.763
So he was here last night
and she was with him?

20:26.797 --> 20:28.097
No.

20:28.131 --> 20:29.598
He has private parties sometimes,

20:29.632 --> 20:30.967
and hires girls from the club.

20:31.001 --> 20:32.801
And every time, Jade would call Mama-San

20:32.836 --> 20:34.136
and try to get on the list.

20:34.171 --> 20:35.771
And last night, she did.

20:35.805 --> 20:37.539
Where was this party?

20:41.311 --> 20:44.480
Upper East Side.

20:55.658 --> 20:57.258
I'm singing.

20:58.728 --> 21:01.830
Was it that bad?

21:01.865 --> 21:03.664
Why do you think
Saito killed her?

21:03.699 --> 21:05.700
Something happened
at the party last night.

21:05.734 --> 21:06.701
One of the girls said Mr. Saito

21:06.735 --> 21:07.935
found Jade going through his things.

21:07.970 --> 21:10.438
He hit the roof and
had his people throw her out.

21:10.473 --> 21:12.974
You have any idea which of his
things she was going through?

21:19.648 --> 21:22.149
Pushing me, man.

21:22.183 --> 21:23.350
Oh.

21:27.723 --> 21:30.858
- $6,000?!
- Ow.

21:30.893 --> 21:33.160
$6,000?! Really?!

21:33.194 --> 21:34.996
<i>- Come on.
- We didn't even finish the bottles!</i>

21:35.030 --> 21:36.830
<i>- At least let us take them...</i>
<i>- Listen, you're rich.</i>

21:36.864 --> 21:39.566
It cost you 6k, <i>and</i>
we got nothing to show for it.

21:39.600 --> 21:40.834
I wouldn't say that.

21:40.868 --> 21:42.802
I mean, beside the lipstick
marks on your shirt.

21:42.837 --> 21:44.203
I actually got a lead in there

21:44.238 --> 21:46.139
that's gonna blow this case
wide... oh, whoa!

21:46.173 --> 21:47.908
Wait, lipstick marks?
On my shirt? Where?

21:47.942 --> 21:49.242
Beckett will kill me.

21:49.276 --> 21:51.244
Oh, my God! I didn't call!

21:51.278 --> 21:53.947
You guys, Beckett <i>is</i> going to kill me.

21:57.298 --> 21:58.999
Ninja attack.

22:17.498 --> 22:18.798
Aah.

22:21.101 --> 22:22.902
Castle, look out!

22:29.276 --> 22:31.510
Don't move!

22:31.545 --> 22:35.113
Stay away.

22:35.148 --> 22:37.215
Next time, you die.

22:41.154 --> 22:42.955
Let me see your hands!

22:58.804 --> 23:01.206
Where did he go?

23:01.240 --> 23:03.442
I don't know. He was just...

23:03.476 --> 23:05.276
Well, you had him.

23:05.316 --> 23:07.412
Now there are <i>two</i> ninjas?

23:07.447 --> 23:08.580
Captain, I know it sounds crazy...

23:08.614 --> 23:09.914
You bet it sounds crazy.

23:09.949 --> 23:11.916
One attacks you.

23:11.951 --> 23:14.586
The other saves your life?
It makes no sense.

23:14.620 --> 23:15.653
Unless...

23:15.688 --> 23:18.155
they are rivals in an ancient feud.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.858
Two warring clans...

23:19.892 --> 23:21.626
one committed to the path of darkness,

23:21.660 --> 23:23.227
the other sworn to follow
the path of light.

23:23.261 --> 23:25.562
This is not a ninja movie, Mr. Castle.

23:25.597 --> 23:27.131
This is a murder investigation.

23:27.165 --> 23:29.300
I don't know where
those ninjas came from, sir.

23:29.334 --> 23:30.968
But what I do know is that our victim

23:31.003 --> 23:32.870
was trying to get close to Mr. Saito.

23:32.904 --> 23:34.271
And when she did, she was killed

23:34.306 --> 23:36.007
by a knife thrown
expertly into her chest.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.341
Now, the guy that attacked us tonight

23:37.376 --> 23:38.909
has the skills to throw that knife.

23:38.943 --> 23:40.677
What do we know about this Saito?

23:40.712 --> 23:43.346
Not much. No first name.

23:43.381 --> 23:45.516
His reputation at the club
is that he's dangerous.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.518
And given the fond farewell
that we received,

23:47.552 --> 23:50.353
I'm guessing that the club
is not gonna share their client

23:50.388 --> 23:52.155
and employee records without a warrant.

23:52.189 --> 23:54.257
I thought this party
was on the Upper East Side?

23:54.291 --> 23:55.759
Have you looked for an address?

23:55.793 --> 23:59.762
Uh, yeah, but the name Saito's
like "Smith" in Japan.

23:59.796 --> 24:00.830
There's literally dozens
of them up there.

24:00.864 --> 24:01.998
Without any information,

24:02.033 --> 24:04.501
it's gonna be very hard to find him.

24:04.535 --> 24:05.768
Maybe not.

24:05.802 --> 24:07.037
Mr. Castle?

24:07.071 --> 24:09.539
We know he threw a party last night.

24:09.573 --> 24:12.208
A guy like Saito,
he's gonna have it catered.

24:12.243 --> 24:15.110
We find that party, we find Saito.

24:15.145 --> 24:16.245
Then get on it.

24:16.279 --> 24:17.446
Yes, sir.

24:23.720 --> 24:26.422
Um...

24:26.456 --> 24:28.024
Yes?

24:28.058 --> 24:31.260
I... yeah, I just... can I expense this?

24:36.166 --> 24:39.668
Don't worry. I'll absorb that.
That's not... I...

24:41.271 --> 24:43.572
Castle, Beckett's calling for you.

24:43.606 --> 24:47.742
You didn't call because
you were in a private room

24:47.777 --> 24:49.744
making out with a geisha?

24:49.779 --> 24:51.479
Okay, we were not making out.

24:51.513 --> 24:52.981
<i>She</i> was kissing <i>me.</i>

24:53.015 --> 24:55.717
A... and for the record, she wasn't
a geisha... she was a hostess.

24:55.751 --> 24:57.285
The difference being...?

24:57.319 --> 24:59.788
Okay. Point taken.

24:59.822 --> 25:02.791
But I <i>was</i> undercover,
and I <i>did</i> get us a lead.

25:02.825 --> 25:04.492
Oh, you know what
I would have appreciated

25:04.526 --> 25:06.760
was a phone call about this lead
somewhere around 10:00,

25:06.795 --> 25:10.398
- because "that's what partners are for."
- Right.

25:10.432 --> 25:12.900
And I was about to make that phone call,

25:12.934 --> 25:15.103
and that's when the ninjas attacked.

25:15.137 --> 25:18.772
You've got an excuse
for everything, don't you?

25:18.807 --> 25:20.774
Okay, I'm getting the feeling

25:20.809 --> 25:23.243
that this is about
more than me not calling.

25:25.546 --> 25:27.514
Well... W... was it that bad?

25:27.548 --> 25:28.816
Oh.

25:28.850 --> 25:31.184
Well, did she go on about
camel treks and yacht races?

25:31.219 --> 25:33.253
Or... did you have a fight
with the goddess?

25:33.287 --> 25:35.322
Mnh-mnh. No. Worse.

25:35.356 --> 25:37.957
Carly was boring.

25:37.992 --> 25:39.526
Boring?

25:39.560 --> 25:41.428
Yeah. All she did
was complain about her husband,

25:41.462 --> 25:42.795
saying, now that she was married,

25:42.830 --> 25:44.864
there's no romance in her life.

25:44.898 --> 25:47.167
It's just an endless routine
of sameness.

25:47.201 --> 25:49.636
So your fabulous friend...

25:49.670 --> 25:52.105
- Is not so fabulous anymore.
- Ah.

25:52.140 --> 25:54.540
I mean, that's not
gonna happen to us, is it?

25:54.574 --> 25:55.842
You've done this before.

25:55.876 --> 25:58.811
Marriage isn't gonna change us, right?

25:58.846 --> 26:00.446
We're not gonna become
one of those couples

26:00.480 --> 26:01.880
that go to the same two restaurants

26:01.882 --> 26:03.402
and only have sex on national holidays?

26:04.518 --> 26:05.985
No, I'm serious.

26:06.020 --> 26:07.820
'Cause that place
that you were at tonight,

26:07.855 --> 26:10.489
it was filled with married men
that are bored with their wives.

26:10.524 --> 26:12.858
I don't ever want to be bored with you,

26:12.892 --> 26:15.894
and I don't want you
to be bored with <i>me,</i> either.

26:15.928 --> 26:17.563
Okay.

26:17.597 --> 26:20.633
Well, then, let's,
um, put it into our vows.

26:20.667 --> 26:23.502
A promise to each other that,
even though we're married,

26:23.537 --> 26:26.337
it doesn't mean
there is no more romance.

26:26.372 --> 26:30.676
And we will never, ever be boring.

26:30.710 --> 26:32.544
- Deal?
- Okay, deal.

26:34.923 --> 26:36.724
Does this mean you forgive me
for not calling?

26:36.749 --> 26:38.183
Mnh-mnh. Not yet.

26:38.217 --> 26:39.651
Well...

26:40.887 --> 26:42.320
...how about now?

26:42.354 --> 26:44.155
Mm... getting there.

26:44.190 --> 26:46.824
This is torture.

26:55.267 --> 26:57.335
Are those cronuts?

26:57.369 --> 26:59.036
Yeah. Have one.

27:00.305 --> 27:01.405
Hey.

27:01.439 --> 27:02.707
They're not <i>both</i> for me.

27:02.741 --> 27:03.941
Yeah, sure they're not.

27:03.975 --> 27:05.475
Where's Castle this morning, anyway?

27:05.510 --> 27:07.277
He's writing down
everything he can remember

27:07.312 --> 27:10.614
about the ninja fight in hopes
to use it for his next book.

27:10.648 --> 27:13.617
So, who went down to Soho
to get cronuts?

27:13.651 --> 27:16.786
We did. Turns out this bakery
delivered a 40th birthday cake

27:16.821 --> 27:21.291
to our suspect and financier,
Michio Saito,

27:21.326 --> 27:23.227
on the Upper East Side
the day Jade was killed.

27:23.261 --> 27:25.562
A financier?

27:25.597 --> 27:27.897
What's Jade doing trying to
get close to a guy like that?

27:27.932 --> 27:30.300
Don't know. But I ran
Saito's name through the system...

27:30.335 --> 27:32.368
it was flagged by organized crime.

27:32.402 --> 27:34.303
- Organized crime like Yakuza?
- Yep.

27:34.338 --> 27:36.305
Rumor is he's high up on the chain

27:36.340 --> 27:38.274
in the Izumi clan out of Okinawa.

27:38.308 --> 27:40.476
His legitimate businesses
are just suspected fronts

27:40.510 --> 27:42.411
for money laundering,
drug trafficking, and extortion.

27:42.446 --> 27:45.749
So what's a ballet dancer doing
going after a guy like this?

27:45.783 --> 27:47.784
What could she possibly want from him?

27:47.818 --> 27:49.918
Well, odds are, whatever it was
got her killed.

27:49.953 --> 27:51.954
Call Miss Tagami at the Consulate.

27:51.988 --> 27:54.423
Have her get ahold of Jade's family.

27:54.458 --> 27:57.092
See if there's a link
between Jade and Michio Saito

27:57.127 --> 27:59.562
or the Izumi clan from Japan.

27:59.596 --> 28:01.437
And why don't we go
and visit the birthday boy?

28:04.401 --> 28:07.202
Mr. Saito will be with you in a moment.

28:07.237 --> 28:10.038
Yo, Beckett.

28:10.073 --> 28:13.241
Just like the weapons
we were attacked with.

28:15.110 --> 28:18.746
It is a 15th-century shuriken.

28:18.781 --> 28:21.515
Very rare.

28:21.549 --> 28:23.251
Mr. Saito, I'm detective Beckett.

28:23.285 --> 28:24.752
This is detective Esposito.

28:24.787 --> 28:26.620
What can I do for you?

28:27.855 --> 28:30.257
Do you recognize this woman?

28:33.361 --> 28:35.962
No. I'm afraid not.

28:35.997 --> 28:37.831
You sure?

28:37.865 --> 28:39.186
From what we hear, the two of you

28:39.200 --> 28:41.502
spent a lot of time together
at Miyago's Hostess Bar.

28:42.904 --> 28:48.374
I spend time with a lot
of different girls at the club.

28:48.409 --> 28:50.443
They're not all very memorable.

28:50.477 --> 28:53.180
We understand that

28:53.214 --> 28:54.848
she was at your birthday
party the other night.

28:54.882 --> 28:56.016
- Was she?
- Mm.

28:56.050 --> 28:57.650
You saying you don't know?

28:57.685 --> 29:01.354
I'm saying there were
many people at the party.

29:01.388 --> 29:03.556
Well, witnesses said that
the two of you had a fight,

29:03.590 --> 29:05.625
that Jade was expelled from your party.

29:05.659 --> 29:07.193
You want to tell us what happened?

29:07.227 --> 29:08.961
No one was expelled from the party.

29:08.995 --> 29:12.131
If she left, it was by her choice.

29:12.165 --> 29:14.467
And I suppose it was just a coincidence

29:14.501 --> 29:16.836
that shortly after she left
she was murdered?

29:16.870 --> 29:19.004
I am not responsible
for what happens to her

29:19.039 --> 29:20.840
out on the street.

29:20.874 --> 29:23.575
Isn't that <i>your</i> job, detective?

29:23.609 --> 29:26.645
I need a list of everyone
that attended that party.

29:29.582 --> 29:33.385
And I will need to see a search warrant.

29:35.355 --> 29:39.023
Now, if there's nothing else...

29:40.760 --> 29:43.362
Organized crime's been trying
to bust this guy for years.

29:43.396 --> 29:45.230
But a man like Saito... he's careful.

29:45.264 --> 29:48.233
We need someone to talk...
we need to find someone

29:48.267 --> 29:50.068
who was actually
at the party that night.

29:50.102 --> 29:53.171
Hey. We got a problem.

29:53.205 --> 29:55.406
I just tried to contact that
consulate officer, Amaya Tagami,

29:55.440 --> 29:56.841
see if there's any connection

29:56.876 --> 29:58.843
between Jade's family and Michio Saito.

29:58.878 --> 30:00.811
According to the Consulate,

30:00.846 --> 30:03.314
<i>Ms.</i> Tagami's been on
maternity leave for two months.

30:03.349 --> 30:05.516
So the woman who showed up here...

30:05.550 --> 30:06.917
Was an imposter.

30:16.322 --> 30:17.588
Who is this woman

30:17.622 --> 30:20.257
and why would she impersonate
a consulate officer?

30:20.295 --> 30:22.262
Maybe she's working for Saito.

30:22.297 --> 30:25.065
If he <i>is</i> Yakuza, he'd have all
kinds of assets working for him.

30:25.099 --> 30:26.366
Makes sense.

30:26.401 --> 30:28.267
That way she could keep tabs
on our investigation.

30:28.302 --> 30:30.236
Ah, she was doing more than that.

30:30.270 --> 30:31.337
She was trying to throw us off track.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.405
Do you remember when she said

30:32.439 --> 30:35.141
that she spoke with
Jade's parents in Japan?

30:35.176 --> 30:38.477
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, Jade didn't have any parents.

30:38.512 --> 30:41.581
Turns out she was raised
in an orphanage from age 10.

30:41.615 --> 30:43.749
Jade was orphaned at age 10?
How did that happen?

30:43.783 --> 30:45.751
Well, I tried to find out,
but prior to the orphanage,

30:45.785 --> 30:47.620
can't find any record of Jade Yamaya...

30:47.654 --> 30:49.322
if that's even her name.

30:49.356 --> 30:50.556
Not a birth certificate, nothing.

30:50.591 --> 30:51.990
It's like she didn't exist.

30:52.025 --> 30:54.993
Sounds like someone was trying
to cover up Jade's history.

30:55.028 --> 30:56.696
Yeah, well, we're gonna have to dig
up whatever they were trying to hide.

30:56.730 --> 30:58.864
If we know her true identity,

30:58.898 --> 31:00.378
it may lead us to why she was killed,

31:00.399 --> 31:02.000
so find out everything you can on Jade.

31:02.035 --> 31:03.168
Start with the orphanage.

31:03.203 --> 31:05.137
Castle and I will talk to Perlmutter,

31:05.171 --> 31:07.606
and we'll see if her body
can tell us who she <i>really</i> was.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.275
I checked the victim for any implants

31:10.309 --> 31:15.114
or traceable medical hardware,
but I discovered nothing

31:15.148 --> 31:17.449
that would aid you in your quest.

31:17.483 --> 31:21.453
However, I did find
a telling mark on her body.

31:21.487 --> 31:24.889
This is a very unusual scar.

31:24.923 --> 31:28.860
Uh, my guess is she sustained
the injury 10 or 12 years ago.

31:28.894 --> 31:30.762
Right about the time
she was sent to the orphanage.

31:30.796 --> 31:32.897
In what way is the scar unusual?

31:32.931 --> 31:34.298
Uh, she took shrapnel.

31:34.332 --> 31:37.468
Based on faint, small scars
over her back and legs,

31:37.502 --> 31:40.037
it was from some kind
of explosion, like an I.E.D.

31:40.072 --> 31:43.174
You're not saying she was
in combat as a 10-year-old girl?

31:43.208 --> 31:45.342
Uh, improbable, but this much I know...

31:45.377 --> 31:47.979
she <i>was</i> treated
by a U.S. military surgeon.

31:48.013 --> 31:49.113
And you know that based on what?

31:49.148 --> 31:52.349
Uh, well, this open-type
of stippled scarring

31:52.384 --> 31:53.651
is the result of a technique
called debriding.

31:53.685 --> 31:57.488
Uh, military surgeons started
using it on blast wounds

31:57.522 --> 32:00.391
during the Afghan war...
saved a lot of lives.

32:00.425 --> 32:02.058
But it wasn't adopted
by civilian doctors

32:02.093 --> 32:03.594
until fairly recently.

32:03.628 --> 32:05.529
Only two military facilities in Japan

32:05.563 --> 32:07.697
were doing this surgery at that time...

32:07.731 --> 32:10.433
one at a base in Yokosuka,
and one in Okinawa.

32:10.467 --> 32:12.269
Okinawa?

32:12.303 --> 32:16.106
That's where Saito's
Yakuza clan came from.

32:16.140 --> 32:18.008
Okay, so, this Okinawa lead
is paying off big time.

32:18.042 --> 32:21.912
We did a search for explosions
there back in the day.

32:23.246 --> 32:25.515
This article is dated
one month before Jade landed

32:25.549 --> 32:26.716
in that orphanage.

32:26.750 --> 32:29.051
- Who are those people?
- That's the Ozu family.

32:29.085 --> 32:30.553
The dad is a building contractor

32:30.587 --> 32:33.289
who had a run-in with the local Yakuza.

32:33.324 --> 32:35.525
The Yakuza settled it
by stabbing his whole family

32:35.559 --> 32:37.527
and then blowing up his house.

32:37.561 --> 32:40.429
And this is the murder weapon
they found at the scene.

32:40.463 --> 32:42.431
- That looks like the knife that was used
on Jade. - Yeah.

32:42.465 --> 32:43.826
Was there a suspect in the murders?

32:43.834 --> 32:45.968
No arrest was made, but rumor had it

32:46.002 --> 32:47.636
the family was murdered
by the Green Dragon.

32:47.670 --> 32:48.971
I take it he's not a reptile?

32:49.005 --> 32:52.374
Reptile, no. Monster, yes.

32:52.408 --> 32:54.043
The Green Dragon
was a secret-ninja enforcer

32:54.077 --> 32:55.377
of the Yakuza.

32:55.411 --> 32:56.978
All of Okinawa was scared of this guy,

32:57.012 --> 32:58.880
and for good reason...
he's a ruthless killer.

32:58.914 --> 33:00.749
Okay, so what does all of this
have to do with Jade?

33:00.783 --> 33:03.918
Well, I think that Jade
was this little girl.

33:03.953 --> 33:05.253
Um... I thought you said
the whole family

33:05.287 --> 33:06.421
was murdered by the Green Dragon?

33:06.456 --> 33:08.256
I got a copy of the police report

33:08.290 --> 33:10.459
from the Okinawa prefecture,
and I noticed this.

33:10.493 --> 33:14.128
The younger daughter, her
birthday is the same as Jade's.

33:14.163 --> 33:16.965
What if she actually
survived that attack?

33:16.999 --> 33:19.633
Well, if she was in that explosion,

33:19.668 --> 33:21.269
that would explain the shrapnel wounds.

33:21.303 --> 33:23.804
Someone must have found her
and wanted to keep her safe.

33:23.839 --> 33:26.174
That's why she was treated
at the military hospital.

33:26.208 --> 33:27.475
Because if she was treated
in a <i>local</i> hospital,

33:27.509 --> 33:28.676
the Yakuza would know
she was still alive.

33:28.710 --> 33:30.110
And that's also why her name was changed

33:30.144 --> 33:31.624
when she was put into the orphanage...

33:31.646 --> 33:33.647
to hide her from the Yakuza.

33:33.682 --> 33:35.516
So, this is a classic revenge story.

33:35.550 --> 33:38.352
Jade was hunting down the man
that killed her family...

33:38.387 --> 33:39.653
the Green Dragon.

33:39.688 --> 33:41.054
Saito's the Green Dragon.

33:41.089 --> 33:42.256
The timeline fits.

33:42.290 --> 33:44.592
He immigrated to this country
10 years ago,

33:44.626 --> 33:45.993
just after the murders.

33:46.027 --> 33:47.027
And when he did,

33:47.061 --> 33:48.262
the Green Dragon
disappeared from Okinawa.

33:48.296 --> 33:49.997
That's what Jade was doing
at the party...

33:50.031 --> 33:53.033
she was looking for proof
that Saito was the Green Dragon.

33:53.067 --> 33:55.335
He got onto her and then he killed her.

33:55.370 --> 33:57.004
And then, when you got close,
he attacked <i>you.</i>

33:57.038 --> 33:58.338
Hey, guys?

33:58.373 --> 34:00.340
That was our team staking out
the abandoned building.

34:00.375 --> 34:01.655
They just saw somebody go inside.

34:01.675 --> 34:05.645
It's the ninja.
Saito's returned to his lair.

34:19.525 --> 34:22.360
Hands behind your head and
come out where I can see you.

34:29.702 --> 34:31.837
You're not a ninja.

34:31.871 --> 34:35.674
No, but you <i>did</i> impersonate
a consulate officer.

34:35.708 --> 34:38.208
On your knees.

34:40.045 --> 34:42.581
This is not what you think,
detective Beckett.

34:42.614 --> 34:45.516
Yeah, that's what all guilty people say.

34:51.056 --> 34:52.190
Is this a badge?

34:52.224 --> 34:53.358
You're a cop?

34:53.391 --> 34:54.993
Not just a cop.

34:55.909 --> 34:57.977
I'm Jade's sister.

35:08.936 --> 35:11.889
My sister and I hid
when the Green Dragon came.

35:11.925 --> 35:13.725
Barely got glimpse of him.

35:13.760 --> 35:16.228
He's dress in black, face covered.

35:16.263 --> 35:19.731
We heard our parents screaming
and begging for their lives.

35:20.834 --> 35:23.635
After the explosion,
my uncle, a policeman,

35:23.670 --> 35:26.304
he found us, and he got us to safety.

35:26.339 --> 35:28.807
He falsified the report
to say that we were killed

35:28.842 --> 35:31.142
so the Yakuza would not look for us.

35:31.177 --> 35:33.979
So then you both survived.

35:34.013 --> 35:36.014
Until now.

35:36.048 --> 35:38.649
What were you doing in that building?

35:40.252 --> 35:43.554
I knew you'd gone there
in connection with the case.

35:43.589 --> 35:45.423
Wanted to make sure
you didn't miss anything.

35:45.458 --> 35:48.193
Why didn't you just tell us
who you were from the start?

35:48.227 --> 35:49.694
Why this whole masquerade?

35:49.728 --> 35:52.429
If the Green Dragon
knew who I was, he'd kill me.

35:54.199 --> 35:56.667
I tried to put what happened
to my family behind me,

35:56.702 --> 35:59.670
but Jade... she could not let it go.

35:59.705 --> 36:02.039
She made it her mission
to find out who he was.

36:02.073 --> 36:03.708
It's why she came to New York.

36:03.742 --> 36:06.043
Three days ago, she called me

36:06.077 --> 36:08.145
and said she was closing in on someone.

36:08.179 --> 36:09.813
- Did she say who?
- No.

36:09.847 --> 36:12.649
She said she needed to get proof first.

36:12.683 --> 36:14.818
I flew out to try and stop her, but...

36:14.852 --> 36:17.321
by the time I got here...

36:18.890 --> 36:20.457
How did she know that the Green Dragon

36:20.492 --> 36:21.492
was in the United States?

36:21.526 --> 36:23.994
The day our family died,

36:24.028 --> 36:26.496
an American businessman
came to see our father.

36:26.531 --> 36:28.732
He was sent by the Green Dragon.

36:28.766 --> 36:31.868
Last year, Jade recognized
that man's voice

36:31.903 --> 36:33.369
from a TV interview.

36:33.404 --> 36:34.871
She tracked him here,

36:34.906 --> 36:37.007
hoping he could lead her
to our parents' killer.

36:37.041 --> 36:40.476
Do you know the name
of this American businessman?

36:40.511 --> 36:43.513
Randall Bedford?
Jade's boyfriend's father?

36:43.547 --> 36:44.680
I don't believe it.

36:44.714 --> 36:46.815
He lived in Okinawa for nearly a decade.

36:46.850 --> 36:49.485
Jade must have started dating
his son to get close to him,

36:49.520 --> 36:51.654
hoping that he knew
the Green Dragon's identity.

36:51.688 --> 36:54.157
Randall didn't just know the Green Dragon.
He was in business with him.

36:54.191 --> 36:56.992
We ran background
on Mr. Bedford's companies...

36:57.027 --> 36:59.028
half of them were co-owned
by Saito International.

37:00.530 --> 37:03.065
Dad, is it true?

37:03.099 --> 37:06.401
We were just kids when we started, Dean.

37:06.436 --> 37:07.402
We were property developers.

37:07.437 --> 37:09.738
Jade's father, he was an architect.

37:09.773 --> 37:12.840
I was the builder,
and Saito was the money guy.

37:12.875 --> 37:16.010
But it was Yakuza money,
and when Jade's father

37:16.045 --> 37:19.181
found out that Saito was Yakuza,
he wanted out.

37:19.215 --> 37:21.349
But the Yakuza never lets anyone out.

37:21.384 --> 37:23.218
That's why I went
to their house that day...

37:23.252 --> 37:26.221
to warn Jade's family that
Saito was coming to kill them.

37:26.255 --> 37:28.056
And after what Saito did to them,

37:28.091 --> 37:30.058
I decided to get as far away as I could.

37:30.092 --> 37:31.893
When Saito moved to New York,

37:31.927 --> 37:33.561
I knew there was no escape, Dean.

37:33.596 --> 37:35.797
So, she's dating me because of you.

37:35.831 --> 37:37.765
I had no idea who she was.

37:37.800 --> 37:40.034
I thought the whole family was dead.

37:40.069 --> 37:41.569
You fell in love with
a ballet dancer. That...

37:41.604 --> 37:43.437
Oh, God.

37:43.472 --> 37:45.272
That's all I knew.

37:45.307 --> 37:48.041
Mr. Bedford,
if she had access to your study,

37:48.076 --> 37:51.712
she could have gotten into
your files from back in Okinawa.

37:51.746 --> 37:53.714
She did. And used them
to track down Saito.

37:53.748 --> 37:57.050
The night of the party,
when he found out who she was,

37:57.085 --> 37:59.553
he called me, enraged,
and I... I begged him...

37:59.588 --> 38:00.921
I said, "please, don't hurt her."

38:00.955 --> 38:02.789
Wait. You knew she was in danger?

38:02.824 --> 38:04.591
You knew and you did nothing?

38:04.626 --> 38:06.827
Dean, he would have come after us.

38:06.861 --> 38:08.996
She's dead because of you.

38:11.966 --> 38:13.934
Hey, I was protecting you.

38:13.968 --> 38:16.236
What was I supposed to do?

38:18.506 --> 38:21.641
Mr. Bedford, I'll tell you
what you can do...

38:21.675 --> 38:25.211
you can help us put Michio Saito away.

38:31.952 --> 38:33.253
Michio Saito?

38:33.287 --> 38:35.121
You can't just walk in here.

38:35.155 --> 38:36.622
We have a warrant for your arrest

38:36.657 --> 38:38.024
for the murder of Jade Yamaya.

38:38.058 --> 38:40.192
You cannot prove I killed Jade.

38:40.226 --> 38:41.694
We searched your place.

38:41.728 --> 38:44.196
We found the dagger
with Jade's blood on it.

38:44.230 --> 38:46.032
We also have witness testimony

38:46.066 --> 38:49.035
affirming that you are the Green Dragon,

38:49.069 --> 38:50.536
responsible for murdering Jade's family.

38:50.570 --> 38:52.704
That gives us motive.

38:52.738 --> 38:56.375
You've been played, detective.
And I've been betrayed.

38:56.409 --> 39:00.646
I did not kill Jade,
and I am not the Green Dragon.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.114
That honor belongs to...

39:08.353 --> 39:10.454
You're the Green Dragon.

39:10.489 --> 39:12.456
No, you just killed the Green Dragon

39:12.491 --> 39:13.958
in a heroic shootout.

39:13.993 --> 39:15.960
That's what the headlines will say.

39:15.995 --> 39:17.915
Too bad you're gonna
have to pay with your lives.

39:21.867 --> 39:23.702
I told you
there were two ninjas!

39:34.246 --> 39:36.547
Castle, get the gun!

39:42.854 --> 39:44.121
Which one do I shoot?

39:52.463 --> 39:54.431
Drop the dagger! Now!

40:01.805 --> 40:02.805
Bedford?!

40:06.477 --> 40:09.212
Saya, drop it.

40:09.247 --> 40:11.548
All this time,

40:11.582 --> 40:15.584
my sister was using you
to get to the Green Dragon,

40:15.619 --> 40:18.621
but it was <i>you</i> all along.

40:18.655 --> 40:21.090
It's the perfect ninja disguise...

40:21.125 --> 40:24.060
a white American
working as a Yakuza enforcer.

40:24.094 --> 40:25.895
He's hiding in plain sight.

40:25.929 --> 40:28.931
You... killed my family.

40:28.966 --> 40:32.100
Saya... drop it.

40:32.135 --> 40:33.602
He took everything!

40:33.637 --> 40:34.737
I know.

40:34.771 --> 40:36.204
I've been there.

40:36.239 --> 40:40.142
You want blood for blood,
but it's not worth it.

40:40.176 --> 40:43.312
Just let him live with who he really is.

40:54.590 --> 40:57.926
And you're afraid
we're gonna become boring?

41:01.330 --> 41:04.465
I contacted my colleagues at
the U.S. and Japanese embassies,

41:04.500 --> 41:05.500
Miss Ozu...

41:05.534 --> 41:07.335
They have decided not to press charges

41:07.369 --> 41:08.903
on impersonating a consulate official.

41:08.937 --> 41:11.339
I appreciate that, Captain.

41:11.373 --> 41:13.207
And I'd like to offer
my personal condolences

41:13.241 --> 41:14.475
on the loss of your sister.

41:16.978 --> 41:19.614
Thank you, detective,

41:19.648 --> 41:22.082
for helping bring
my family's killer to justice.

41:22.117 --> 41:27.521
Well, thank <i>you</i> for protecting
the people that I care about.

41:27.555 --> 41:29.890
Oh, um, there's something
that we have to give you.

41:33.494 --> 41:36.130
Here you go. It's not evidence anymore.

41:43.838 --> 41:47.641
My sister had this made in Okinawa.

41:47.675 --> 41:51.378
It is a replica of the one that
was used to kill my parents.

41:51.412 --> 41:53.213
So the place we found it,

41:53.247 --> 41:55.348
I'm guessing that wasn't
the killer's lair?

41:55.382 --> 41:58.684
No, that was my sister's shrine.

41:58.719 --> 41:59.919
I took this from you

41:59.954 --> 42:02.655
because I thought I would
need it to avenge Jade.

42:02.689 --> 42:04.657
Well...

42:04.691 --> 42:06.559
I guess ninjas really do exist.

42:06.593 --> 42:09.729
No, I was not lying about that.

42:09.763 --> 42:13.065
There are no more ninjas, Mr. Castle.

42:13.099 --> 42:16.402
I am merely a practitioner
of the martial arts.

42:16.436 --> 42:19.405
But I'm very, very good.

42:19.439 --> 42:21.440
I'll say.

42:24.845 --> 42:27.279
That's gonna be...

42:30.083 --> 42:31.383
Ow!

42:31.417 --> 42:33.550
Mr. Castle!

42:35.754 --> 42:37.388
Not boring.

42:37.422 --> 42:40.791
Nope. Nope, not at all.
