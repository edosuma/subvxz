00:36.203 --> 00:37.621
Roll the tape.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.291
Tape rolling.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.342
They're getting ready to pour.

01:18.536 --> 01:19.579
Nothing.

01:21.289 --> 01:25.335
They're no closer to finding the formula
than they were five months ago.

01:28.713 --> 01:30.882
Looks like they're packing it up
for the night.

01:30.965 --> 01:35.470
I wish they'd either discover that formula
or learn to go home at a decent hour.

01:44.854 --> 01:45.980
Who's that?

01:46.564 --> 01:49.942
That's the new janitor.
The kid's name is Alan Akroy.

01:50.484 --> 01:54.572
A student working his way through
botany school or something like that.

03:36.548 --> 03:37.799
Look at that.

03:40.427 --> 03:41.845
Why, that kid!

03:44.139 --> 03:45.891
He discovered the formula.

05:22.236 --> 05:24.321
There's been a fire
at the Whitaker building.

05:24.405 --> 05:27.324
Yeah, I'm looking at the picture
in the newspaper right now.

05:27.408 --> 05:30.578
The details as to how the fire started
are a little sketchy.

05:30.661 --> 05:32.580
Yeah, that was intentional, Diana.

05:32.663 --> 05:36.333
You see, it seems the Whitaker building
housed a lab...

05:36.542 --> 05:39.420
where an industrial group
was developing a new explosive.

05:39.503 --> 05:41.171
In the middle of a business district?

05:41.255 --> 05:42.590
Yeah, that's right.

05:42.673 --> 05:44.133
According to our sources...

05:44.216 --> 05:48.304
this explosive was supposed
to revolutionize the industry.

05:48.387 --> 05:50.514
It was made up of very stable...

05:50.597 --> 05:53.434
easily packaged,
easily handled chemicals...

05:53.726 --> 05:57.187
and only when it was combined
with an equally stable catalyst...

05:57.271 --> 05:58.772
were they to become volatile.

05:58.856 --> 06:01.275
Looks like somebody found the catalyst.

06:02.067 --> 06:03.777
Just who's behind all this anyway?

06:03.861 --> 06:07.030
Hopewell International must move,
and move quickly.

06:07.114 --> 06:10.325
The fire in the lab we were using
means we've succeeded.

06:10.409 --> 06:14.580
It means the product that will bring us
billions is finally within our grasp.

06:14.663 --> 06:19.084
No, Rodney, I've been assured
the explosion did not occur spontaneously.

06:19.167 --> 06:21.420
Human hands were involved.
The human brain.

06:21.503 --> 06:25.090
Somebody has inadvertently learned
the secret of the Explo formula.

06:25.173 --> 06:27.676
Somebody whom we must find
and will find...

06:27.759 --> 06:30.887
despite any and all interference
by our enemies.

06:30.971 --> 06:32.764
You get me BW on the phone.

06:33.640 --> 06:37.144
Who are the enemies that warrant
the use of such toxins?

06:37.227 --> 06:38.437
There are two.

06:38.520 --> 06:42.732
The IADC,
and Rudolph Furst Enterprises.

06:43.900 --> 06:47.487
You're absolutely certain
that this Alan Akroy caused the fire?

06:47.821 --> 06:50.574
He was in the room
just before everything blew.

06:50.699 --> 06:53.577
They didn't find any bodies.
It looks like he got out.

06:53.660 --> 06:55.203
It also looks like...

06:55.287 --> 06:57.956
whatever he accidentally did in that lab...

06:58.039 --> 07:00.375
is exactly what
those three Hopewell scientists...

07:00.458 --> 07:03.294
have been trying to do
for the past five months.

07:03.712 --> 07:04.963
Yes, sir.

07:07.090 --> 07:10.176
So it appears that if we find Alan Akroy...

07:10.844 --> 07:13.972
and make him tell us
exactly what he did in that lab...

07:14.472 --> 07:17.308
then we can throw away
all of our surveillance equipment...

07:17.392 --> 07:20.436
and the Explo formula will be ours,
free and clear.

07:21.688 --> 07:25.608
Trouble is, Hopewell knows
everything we know about Akroy.

07:26.526 --> 07:28.903
And the IADC would like
nothing better...

07:28.987 --> 07:33.533
than to keep that Explo formula
out of the free-enterprise system.

07:34.325 --> 07:36.828
They've already deployed an agent:

07:37.287 --> 07:38.496
Diana Prince.

07:38.746 --> 07:39.831
No matter.

07:40.832 --> 07:42.667
I trust you know how important it is...

07:42.750 --> 07:46.003
that we be the first
to find this Alan Akroy.

07:52.885 --> 07:54.595
Okay, you guys. There you go.

07:54.679 --> 07:58.349
But I'm warning you, it may be a long time
before anybody does this again.

07:58.432 --> 08:01.352
Old Uncle Alan got himself
in some fix last night.

08:01.435 --> 08:03.104
About $10 million worth.

08:12.822 --> 08:14.115
Oh, boy.

08:15.783 --> 08:16.951
Cripes!

08:19.829 --> 08:20.913
Holy cow!

08:21.706 --> 08:25.292
What a time to find out
how far you can go on $6.78...

08:25.376 --> 08:27.461
and one lousy change of clothes.

08:28.295 --> 08:30.089
Come on, open up.

08:30.172 --> 08:31.757
For Pete's sake.

08:36.303 --> 08:39.515
Wonder if there's a law
against breaking and exiting.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.286
Good morning, Ira.

09:01.370 --> 09:02.830
Good morning, Eve.

09:02.955 --> 09:04.540
Regarding Alan Akroy...

09:04.623 --> 09:07.084
have you tapped all the computers
in the LA area...

09:07.167 --> 09:09.711
that have the name Alan Akroy
in their memory banks?

09:09.795 --> 09:11.004
Affirmative.

09:11.088 --> 09:14.049
The Irac computer
will now compile a profile...

09:14.132 --> 09:16.301
outlining the most likely behavior.

09:16.385 --> 09:17.970
So we can predict his moves.

09:18.053 --> 09:19.429
That is correct.

09:20.013 --> 09:23.976
Ira, is there anything you can tell us now
that will help us find him?

09:26.061 --> 09:29.481
According to computerized records,
he has yet to claim his laundry...

09:29.564 --> 09:32.359
at the Clean 'Em Up Company
on Orchard Blvd.

09:32.526 --> 09:35.737
Great. If he's running,
he'll probably need those clothes.

09:35.821 --> 09:37.406
I'll get that information to Diana.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.950
She should be landing
in Los Angeles any minute now.

10:33.044 --> 10:34.295
Anybody home?

10:34.796 --> 10:35.922
Yeah?

10:37.131 --> 10:40.134
Hi. I have a friend
who's got some laundry here.

10:40.218 --> 10:43.680
And I was wondering
if you could tell me if he's got it yet.

10:44.889 --> 10:46.391
Maybe. Name?

10:46.933 --> 10:49.477
Akroy. Alan Akroy.

10:54.565 --> 10:57.902
The name's not in the book,
but you can check out in back.

11:00.488 --> 11:04.158
- Come on, I'll take you on a tour.
- What, step into your parlor?

11:10.998 --> 11:13.751
I bet you always wondered
what happens to your clothes...

11:13.834 --> 11:15.503
once you surrender them at the door.

11:15.586 --> 11:18.256
Actually, I've always been
sort of a do-it-yourselfer...

11:18.339 --> 11:20.174
when it comes to cleaning and laundry.

11:20.257 --> 11:21.801
- Oh, really?
- Really.

11:26.389 --> 11:28.599
- Do you wear polyester?
- No.

11:29.141 --> 11:32.019
If you did,
this is what happens to polyester.

11:32.269 --> 11:34.647
- That's very interesting.
- Yes.

11:37.775 --> 11:41.028
And right here
is where we dry-clean the acrylics.

11:42.571 --> 11:45.449
You're not supposed to dry-clean acrylics.

11:46.200 --> 11:47.993
Whoever told you that?

11:58.963 --> 12:01.840
Okay, now, wait a minute.
What's going on?

12:10.057 --> 12:12.976
It's Diana Prince from IADC. Go get her!

12:21.985 --> 12:23.695
Diana, run!

12:48.512 --> 12:51.807
All right.
Why were you attacking Diana Prince?

12:54.059 --> 12:57.395
- To get her out of the way.
- You're after Alan Akroy, too?

12:58.438 --> 13:01.441
- Yes.
- Why? Who are you working for?

13:01.525 --> 13:03.026
- Hopewell?
- Furst.

13:04.903 --> 13:06.613
Rudolph Furst Enterprises.

13:21.169 --> 13:24.172
- Diana. How are you?
- Well, I'm not sure.

13:24.255 --> 13:26.966
Rudolph Furst just tried
to take me to the cleaners.

13:27.050 --> 13:28.760
- You okay?
- Yeah.

13:29.219 --> 13:31.471
Those industrialists play for keeps.

13:31.888 --> 13:33.389
Hopewell and Furst.

13:33.473 --> 13:34.557
You got it.

13:34.641 --> 13:37.602
Furst is in this up to his corporate wallet.

13:37.852 --> 13:40.188
Yeah. Now, there's a pair to draw to.

13:40.605 --> 13:42.732
You better get over to Furst Enterprises.

13:42.815 --> 13:44.192
I'm on my way, Steve.

13:44.275 --> 13:45.985
What about Akroy?

13:46.694 --> 13:48.613
I think he's in over his head.

13:48.696 --> 13:50.156
Get a line on him?

13:50.365 --> 13:52.283
- Running.
- Any idea where?

13:52.617 --> 13:53.951
So far, just running.

13:54.035 --> 13:55.286
Stay with it.

13:56.287 --> 13:57.413
Bye.

14:11.928 --> 14:14.639
- Hey, come on. Slow up, will you?
- Alan?

14:15.848 --> 14:18.392
Look, don't stop. Just keep running.

14:18.476 --> 14:20.811
Slow up a little bit.

14:20.895 --> 14:23.522
I can't let anybody recognize me.
I'm in big trouble.

14:23.606 --> 14:26.359
What's the matter?
Did you just get done dumping somebody?

14:26.442 --> 14:28.152
Come on, this is serious.

14:28.527 --> 14:29.862
I need help, bad.

14:29.945 --> 14:32.406
Yeah, well, why don't you go ask Barbara?

14:32.490 --> 14:37.036
- Or Susan? Or Sally-
- Come on, you're the only one I can trust.

14:37.119 --> 14:40.206
No, what you mean is
I'm the only one you know you can sucker.

14:40.289 --> 14:44.293
- What do you need this time? Money?
- Hey, come on, slow down, will you?

14:45.711 --> 14:47.171
I could use $50.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.547
- Alan!
- I have an explanation!

14:48.631 --> 14:52.760
I don't wanna hear your explanations.
They all begin with, "I've met this girl. "

14:52.843 --> 14:54.136
- Meg!
- I can't hear you!

14:54.220 --> 14:57.514
Listen. You know the Whitaker building
that burned down last night?

14:57.598 --> 15:00.434
I did that. That's right, I did that.

15:02.061 --> 15:04.688
- You burned down a building?
- Yeah. It was an accident.

15:04.772 --> 15:06.231
Then turn yourself in.

15:06.315 --> 15:08.650
Are you kidding?
That building cost $10 million!

15:08.734 --> 15:10.819
But if it wasn't your fault, then it's okay.

15:10.903 --> 15:13.781
These insurance companies
play for keeps, you know.

15:13.864 --> 15:16.658
They'd like nothing better
than to pin this on somebody.

15:16.742 --> 15:18.619
Those guys catch up with me
and I'm dead.

15:18.702 --> 15:20.204
This is ridiculous.

15:21.705 --> 15:24.291
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Listen, Megs.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.628
All I want is a little money
so I can get out of town...

15:27.711 --> 15:30.672
until this whole thing blows over,
that's all.

15:31.131 --> 15:35.218
After buying this disguise,
all I've got is $3.60. Come on.

15:37.429 --> 15:39.181
Help me. Please?

15:41.892 --> 15:45.520
It would be worth $50, Alan,
just to get you out of my life...

15:45.604 --> 15:47.689
- once and for all.
- Great. Oh, you're a doll.

15:47.773 --> 15:51.610
- But I can't get it until tomorrow.
- That's okay. Just keep running.

15:51.860 --> 15:53.153
- Now, listen.
- What?

15:53.236 --> 15:56.698
They're probably gonna be watching you
in hopes that I'll make contact.

15:56.782 --> 15:59.493
So when you get the money,
this is what I want you to do.

15:59.576 --> 16:02.662
You go to the airport, there's an ash can
underneath a poster...

16:02.746 --> 16:04.414
right next to the phone booth.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.136
Good morning, Ira.

16:18.219 --> 16:19.304
Good morning.

16:19.387 --> 16:20.513
How are you?

16:20.597 --> 16:24.642
A value judgment. I am not capable
ofbeing anything but accurate.

16:24.726 --> 16:28.480
I am in Washington, D. C.
What I am is a computer.

16:28.688 --> 16:32.192
Why I am here is probably
the reason you set me in motion.

16:32.275 --> 16:33.735
I'm sorry I asked.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.069
Sorrow is also something-

16:35.153 --> 16:36.905
All right.

16:37.739 --> 16:40.450
Now, are you familiar
with Hopewell Enterprises?

16:40.533 --> 16:41.618
Of course.

16:41.743 --> 16:43.912
Then how about Furst International?

16:43.995 --> 16:47.916
Both have business and scientific
interests on a global basis.

16:48.791 --> 16:51.836
What if I added the name Alan Akroy?

16:51.920 --> 16:54.881
Am I undergoing
an examination of some sort?

16:54.964 --> 16:57.300
No. You are supposed
to be doing a profile on him.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.052
What do you know about Akroy?

16:59.135 --> 17:02.430
So far, about the same
as I know about John Smith.

17:02.513 --> 17:05.974
Look, Ira, I'm trying to help.
Now, he's involved with them.

17:06.059 --> 17:09.353
The only reason I do not function
perfectly at all times...

17:09.436 --> 17:11.396
is because humans try to help.

17:11.481 --> 17:12.607
Oh, boy.

17:12.940 --> 17:15.233
Just get me the profile on Alan Akroy.

17:15.318 --> 17:16.903
If you will give me time.

17:16.986 --> 17:18.029
You've got it.

17:18.112 --> 17:19.946
Tick-tock.

17:39.050 --> 17:41.886
You're denying that you hired
the men who attacked me?

17:41.969 --> 17:43.679
Can you prove that I did?

17:46.098 --> 17:48.225
One of them admitted you did.

17:49.560 --> 17:52.438
What Wonder Woman drags
out of people with her lasso...

17:52.521 --> 17:54.398
hardly constitutes truth.

17:54.940 --> 17:56.150
I see.

17:56.442 --> 17:58.611
So three men who used to work for you...

17:58.694 --> 18:02.364
just happened to be in the laundry
and just happened to attack me.

18:02.448 --> 18:04.241
Is that what you're saying?

18:04.909 --> 18:08.245
How they spend their time
when they're not in my employ...

18:08.329 --> 18:10.122
is strictly their business.

18:10.664 --> 18:12.583
Enough with the games, okay?

18:13.792 --> 18:16.336
We both know that we're both
after Alan Akroy...

18:16.420 --> 18:18.672
who we both thought
was gonna be in the laundry.

18:18.756 --> 18:19.882
Alan Akroy?

18:20.340 --> 18:25.220
You and the way you do business
are loathsome, Mr. Furst.

18:29.850 --> 18:31.018
Good day.

18:43.155 --> 18:46.074
The lady's visit was not a long one.

18:46.408 --> 18:48.535
Were you able to plant the homing device?

18:48.618 --> 18:49.828
Yes, sir.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.456
I'll be on her tail from now on.

18:52.539 --> 18:55.000
I'd advise you to exercise discretion.

18:55.876 --> 18:59.129
The wonders that bail money can work
are not infinite in number.

18:59.212 --> 19:02.716
Hey, look. Don't worry. She won't spot us.

19:29.617 --> 19:31.161
Thank you very much.

19:35.915 --> 19:37.917
Hi, thanks a lot.

19:38.001 --> 19:41.337
No problem. You're heading my way.
Glad to help.

19:43.173 --> 19:45.008
You got an appointment someplace?

19:45.091 --> 19:47.343
Oh, no. I'm just headed out of town.

19:49.012 --> 19:51.848
I wouldn't worry about catching
your bus anymore...

19:51.931 --> 19:53.016
Alan.

19:53.600 --> 19:55.602
I'm not gonna take a bus.

19:57.854 --> 20:00.440
Hey, how did you know my name?

20:00.523 --> 20:02.859
Hopewell International has its ways.

20:02.942 --> 20:04.068
Oh, boy.

20:04.152 --> 20:07.196
Just relax and leave the driving to us.

20:07.822 --> 20:11.325
No offense, but no, thank you!

20:14.620 --> 20:17.206
Listen,
no lady private eye's gonna get me!

20:30.595 --> 20:34.390
So you're leaving town,
but you're not going to take the bus.

20:38.394 --> 20:41.689
Ira just finished his profile
on Alan Akroy, Diana.

20:42.273 --> 20:44.233
And according to this thing...

20:44.316 --> 20:48.404
Alan will go into hiding in Bakersfield
at the home of a distant cousin.

20:48.863 --> 20:50.614
How does Ira think he'll get there?

20:50.698 --> 20:53.492
By plane.
The very next economy flight out.

20:54.952 --> 20:57.746
Okay, Steve, I'm on my way.
Anything else?

20:57.830 --> 21:01.584
Yeah. Ira says Alan fell in love
with the theater in high school...

21:01.667 --> 21:04.044
and never quite got off the stage.

21:04.461 --> 21:07.089
So watch for disguises.

21:07.631 --> 21:09.508
Terrific. Over and out.

22:20.912 --> 22:22.581
Meggie, hi, it's Alan.

22:22.664 --> 22:24.291
Why are you calling me?

22:24.374 --> 22:27.502
I wanted to know if you put the stuff
where I told you to put it.

22:27.585 --> 22:30.005
It's in the trashcan, in a paper bag...

22:30.088 --> 22:33.383
underneath the mailbox
in front of the visitor airlines counter.

22:33.466 --> 22:36.386
Right. Megs, you sure
nobody saw you put it there?

22:36.469 --> 22:39.139
Oh, I'm sure.
My Kojak disguise worked like a charm.

22:39.222 --> 22:40.306
Meg, come on.

22:40.390 --> 22:41.891
Look, Alan, the money is there!

22:41.975 --> 22:44.936
Okay? Now, just pick it up
and leave me alone for good, okay?

22:45.019 --> 22:47.272
Listen, there's one more thing.

22:49.107 --> 22:51.401
- What?
- Would you water my plants?

22:52.277 --> 22:55.989
They're only plants. There's no reason
for them to suffer for our mistakes.

22:56.072 --> 22:58.825
- Our mistakes?
- You know what I mean.

23:00.660 --> 23:01.828
Oh, my gosh!

23:01.911 --> 23:05.039
I gotta go. Water them twice a week
and mist whenever you can.

23:05.123 --> 23:07.208
I'll send you a postcard. Bye-bye.

23:13.214 --> 23:14.340
What do you want?

23:14.424 --> 23:17.260
- Alan Akroy?
- No time. This man's got all my money!

23:17.343 --> 23:20.263
I mean, you must've mistaken me
for somebody else.

23:20.346 --> 23:21.931
My name's Gerald Sternbach.

23:22.014 --> 23:24.058
I know you're Alan.
Even with that disguise.

23:24.142 --> 23:26.102
And you've got a reason to be paranoid.

23:26.185 --> 23:27.353
But you've gotta trust me.

23:27.436 --> 23:30.231
Sure. With you holding my coat,
I'm supposed to trust you?

23:30.314 --> 23:32.567
- I'm sorry. Is that better?
- Much.

24:17.778 --> 24:19.446
There's no reason to be afraid.

24:19.530 --> 24:22.950
- Nobody ever landed before.
- I'm here to help you, okay?

24:24.410 --> 24:25.911
What about her?

24:26.745 --> 24:29.957
Thank you, Wonder Woman.
But I can take over from here.

24:30.874 --> 24:34.044
Since I've already met your counterparts
at Furst Enterprises...

24:34.128 --> 24:37.131
you must be
with Hopewell International, Miss...

24:37.714 --> 24:40.300
BW will do. Step aside.

24:40.968 --> 24:44.513
- Oh, boy.
- Just stay behind me. You'll be all right.

24:44.596 --> 24:46.849
- I don't know about this.
- Stay behind me.

24:46.932 --> 24:48.267
All right. Okay.

24:49.017 --> 24:50.727
Only at a distance.

24:52.437 --> 24:54.439
- Alan!
- Keep her there.

25:01.196 --> 25:03.949
I wouldn't try to fire this thing
if I were you.

25:23.343 --> 25:26.054
- You look like you could use some rest.
- Yeah.

25:27.305 --> 25:30.475
You just come with me,
and you won't ever have to run again.

25:30.558 --> 25:32.769
Fine. Okay. Wonderful. Just take me.

25:36.523 --> 25:39.609
I always hated my cousin
in Bakersfield anyway.

25:47.283 --> 25:49.202
Buck up, kid. You should be flattered.

25:49.285 --> 25:53.873
I mean, this elevator is only used
by clients and guests of Mr. Rudolph Furst.

25:54.457 --> 25:56.417
Who the heck is Rudolph Furst?

25:56.501 --> 25:59.170
I the heck am Rudolph Furst.

26:01.714 --> 26:02.799
So what?

26:02.882 --> 26:06.970
Am I supposed to get sweaty palms
just 'cause you bug your elevator?

26:07.095 --> 26:08.137
What am I supposed to do?

26:08.221 --> 26:11.975
Crumple up like a wet paper towel
because your name is Rudolph Furst?

26:12.058 --> 26:14.894
Or throw myself at your mercy
because a couple of thugs...

26:14.978 --> 26:17.647
pick me up on the street,
and put me in the back seat...

26:17.730 --> 26:20.775
on the floor in their car
and bring me in back doors and stuff?

26:20.858 --> 26:22.193
You think that scares me?

26:22.276 --> 26:25.238
You think I don't know
what's going on around here?

26:25.321 --> 26:28.533
- Do you know what's going on, Mr. Akroy?
- No, what?

26:29.450 --> 26:32.537
There's really no need
for you to be so emotional.

26:34.872 --> 26:36.165
Just relax.

26:36.874 --> 26:41.003
If you want me to relax, why don't you
just call me Alan, for Pete's sakes?

26:41.087 --> 26:42.713
We all know you're responsible...

26:42.797 --> 26:45.925
for burning the Whitaker building
to the ground, Alan.

26:49.512 --> 26:51.864
You're an insurance company, hey.

26:52.165 --> 26:54.016
That's great, that's
fine. I've been looking.

26:54.100 --> 26:56.268
Listen, I wanna tell you everything.

26:56.352 --> 26:58.312
Listen, I did it. It was an accident.

26:58.396 --> 27:01.148
I didn't do it on purpose.
I wanna tell you all about it.

27:01.232 --> 27:04.527
If you've got a confession, I'll sign it.
You got a confession?

27:04.610 --> 27:06.904
- Have you got a pen?
- Alan.

27:06.987 --> 27:09.406
We don't want you to confess to the fire.

27:09.490 --> 27:11.283
We want you to recreate it.

27:12.535 --> 27:14.828
- We know it wasn't your fault.
- That's right.

27:14.912 --> 27:17.039
It was the result of an explosion.

27:18.207 --> 27:21.627
Those chemicals in that lab that
you were working on simply blew up.

27:21.710 --> 27:22.836
That's right.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.714
They blew up because of something
you did while working.

27:25.798 --> 27:26.882
Yes, that's right!

27:26.966 --> 27:30.052
Look, all I was doing was,
I was cleaning up the counters...

27:30.135 --> 27:32.388
and then I came over to this one...

27:35.432 --> 27:36.683
Go on.

27:36.934 --> 27:38.602
I want to know why I'm here.

27:38.685 --> 27:42.314
Does it make you nervous
when I call you Mr. Akroy?

27:42.648 --> 27:45.776
- Not in the least.
- Let me tell you like it really is.

27:45.901 --> 27:47.653
This is a holiday weekend.

27:47.736 --> 27:50.864
And very shortly, this whole building
will be empty...

27:51.406 --> 27:54.701
for three whole days,
with the exception of us.

27:55.410 --> 27:57.412
Because none of us are leaving.

27:57.579 --> 28:01.583
Not until you tell me exactly
what you did to cause that fire.

28:01.667 --> 28:04.544
- Maybe I don't wanna.
- Well, then Mr. Akroy...

28:05.837 --> 28:10.175
these next three days may very well
be the last three days of your life.

28:45.585 --> 28:47.629
- Meg Kellogg?
- Yes?

28:48.296 --> 28:51.591
I'm Diana Prince with the IADC.

28:56.137 --> 28:59.265
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about Alan Akroy.

28:59.557 --> 29:02.268
Fine. Just don't expect any answers.

29:04.562 --> 29:06.648
- Do you know where he is?
- Nope.

29:07.941 --> 29:10.735
- Do you have any idea where he might be?
- No.

29:12.820 --> 29:16.115
Alan might be in a lot of trouble.

29:16.199 --> 29:18.826
Look, I don't care. I really do not care.

29:18.910 --> 29:22.163
That guy has dumped me five times.
First it was the stewardess...

29:22.246 --> 29:25.500
then the nurse, teacher's assistant,
cashier in the bookstore...

29:25.583 --> 29:27.418
and finally the meter maid.

29:27.794 --> 29:29.462
Count them. Five times.

29:29.962 --> 29:32.632
Little creep. Why should I care
what happens to him?

29:32.715 --> 29:34.509
I know he phoned you.

29:34.592 --> 29:36.719
I'm not going to answer any questions.

29:36.803 --> 29:39.388
If he's in trouble,
nothing can make me happier...

29:39.472 --> 29:43.017
unless possibly he fell out of a jumbo jet
at 30,000 feet.

29:46.020 --> 29:47.188
Now, listen.

29:47.271 --> 29:49.482
Look, you want to know about Alan?

29:49.565 --> 29:51.734
Why don't you try asking Susan...

29:51.859 --> 29:56.405
or Sally, or Barbara, or Cheri,
or Kia, or...

30:17.426 --> 30:21.805
Something tells me this is a bit of repair
work Meg Kellogg did not authorize.

30:22.556 --> 30:24.475
Meg would get off work...

30:29.563 --> 30:31.815
be unable to start her car...

30:33.984 --> 30:37.112
and you just happen to drop by
and offer her a lift.

30:37.571 --> 30:39.782
Yeah, but I wasn't gonna hurt her.

30:39.865 --> 30:41.784
I mean, I just wanted to make sure...

30:41.867 --> 30:44.495
she would stay put
once I dropped her off at her place.

30:44.578 --> 30:47.414
- Without the car-
- Right. Now, get in.

30:48.290 --> 30:50.417
And please, go on.

30:51.376 --> 30:55.589
I just wanted to make it easier
for whoever has Akroy to find her.

30:55.672 --> 30:58.592
You see, if the kid doesn't talk,
and chances are he won't...

30:58.675 --> 31:01.094
then they'll go after her to make him talk.

31:01.178 --> 31:03.931
And when they did,
I was going to go after them.

31:04.014 --> 31:06.224
Now you're not going anywhere.

31:07.893 --> 31:10.812
But you can't just leave me here like this.

31:11.271 --> 31:12.648
Let's look at it this way.

31:12.731 --> 31:16.485
When the police come, you can tell
them exactly what you were doing there...

31:16.568 --> 31:19.154
and if Hopewell bails you out again,
you'll be free.

31:19.237 --> 31:21.448
I hope I don't forget to call them.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.083
Bye.

31:35.545 --> 31:36.671
Come on!

31:38.798 --> 31:41.384
There's gotta be a law against this!

31:42.177 --> 31:46.640
Really, Mr. Akroy.
You're making this unreasonably difficult.

31:48.016 --> 31:51.102
An exact replica of the lab
that was in the Whitaker building...

31:51.186 --> 31:53.063
is set up downstairs.

31:53.396 --> 31:55.106
Now, all you need do is go in...

31:55.190 --> 31:57.984
and show us precisely
what you did to cause the fire.

31:58.068 --> 32:01.321
Oh, sure. And then what happens
after I tell you?

32:02.197 --> 32:03.531
Then you'll be released.

32:03.615 --> 32:07.785
Right off to Catalina with a custom-made
cement-lined suit. No, thank you.

32:12.999 --> 32:15.960
Mr. Akroy, I'd like you to meet Dr. Black.

32:18.630 --> 32:20.798
Don't tell me he's a dentist.

32:23.259 --> 32:26.888
No, but he will make you tell me
exactly what I wish to know.

32:28.389 --> 32:29.474
No way.

32:48.910 --> 32:50.536
And now, Alan...

32:50.620 --> 32:54.081
I want you to go back
to the night of the fire.

32:54.957 --> 32:57.084
I want you to remember...

32:57.168 --> 33:00.296
and tell me everything you did...

33:00.379 --> 33:02.381
before the fire started.

33:02.673 --> 33:06.635
But you know what, Barbara?
This is really a very nice apartment.

33:07.928 --> 33:10.347
Come on, Alan. Think back.

33:10.765 --> 33:14.226
- It's the night before the fire.
- Oh, yeah.

33:14.602 --> 33:17.772
You are walking
up to the Whitaker building.

33:17.980 --> 33:21.275
You're collecting your cleaning equipment.

33:21.567 --> 33:24.528
Kia, this corner over here
could use a nice plant.

33:25.112 --> 33:28.616
How about a nice Dieffenbachia amoena?
You'll like that.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.368
Make him respond to your questions,
Doctor.

33:31.452 --> 33:34.413
Listen to me, Alan! Now, think back!

33:34.705 --> 33:38.459
It's Wednesday.
You've got your bucket and your mop.

33:38.667 --> 33:42.421
Look, Cheryl, I'm going to take a nap.

33:42.504 --> 33:44.631
It's been a rough day, okay?

33:49.803 --> 33:53.724
- You fool, you put him under!
- But the dose was minimal!

33:53.807 --> 33:56.602
Are you trying to tell me
that this drug won't work on him?

33:56.685 --> 33:58.061
Apparently not.

33:58.145 --> 34:01.231
There must be something
abnormal in his metabolism.

34:01.315 --> 34:05.652
Of course it's abnormal! Why should it be
any different than the rest of him?

34:07.487 --> 34:10.574
Ted, take Dr. Doolittle here home.

34:11.116 --> 34:13.159
And then go pick up the girl.

34:27.799 --> 34:29.259
Which one are you?

34:38.810 --> 34:43.023
Hi. It's me, Diana Prince.
We talked before, remember? In the gym?

34:44.274 --> 34:47.694
You talked. I refused, and I still refuse.

34:48.027 --> 34:50.614
This time I came to talk about you, Meg.

34:51.197 --> 34:54.284
I have reason to believe
that you could be in danger.

34:54.534 --> 34:57.412
I can take care of myself. I always have.

34:59.164 --> 35:02.042
Why would I be in danger, anyway?
Because of Alan?

35:02.125 --> 35:03.626
I'm afraid so. Yeah.

35:04.753 --> 35:06.588
He's really in trouble?

35:07.046 --> 35:10.383
And because you're someone
that's close to him, you could be, too.

35:10.467 --> 35:12.385
I have news for somebody.

35:12.469 --> 35:16.723
He has thrown me over so many times
that I couldn't care less if he just goes...

35:25.106 --> 35:27.191
Oh, boy. Who am I trying to kid?

35:28.401 --> 35:30.653
I am in his trailer
in the middle of the night...

35:30.737 --> 35:34.574
watering his plants,
trying to convince you that I hate him.

35:35.491 --> 35:38.703
- I'm the one who's in trouble.
- It's tough, isn't it?

35:39.579 --> 35:42.165
To have to do all the giving all the time.

35:42.665 --> 35:44.208
I'm so stupid.

35:45.376 --> 35:48.588
I give and I give and I give,
and all he does-

35:48.671 --> 35:51.257
Come to you when he needs help.

35:51.966 --> 35:55.928
He comes to you, Meg.
I mean, that means something, doesn't it?

35:56.846 --> 35:57.972
I guess so.

36:03.519 --> 36:06.564
No need to panic.
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

36:23.914 --> 36:25.124
You know, it's really funny.

36:25.207 --> 36:28.169
I have dealt with spies
from all over the world.

36:29.003 --> 36:33.090
Only now I find out the most
ruthless ones are in the business world.

36:34.049 --> 36:36.260
Live and learn, I always say.

36:39.263 --> 36:43.309
You take her up,
I'll stay with Miss Disenchanted here.

36:43.684 --> 36:44.810
Cute.

36:44.935 --> 36:46.353
What's gonna happen?

36:46.437 --> 36:49.773
You are going to convince
that turkey upstairs to spill his guts.

36:49.857 --> 36:51.817
I'm not gonna do anything to help you.

36:51.900 --> 36:56.071
All you'll have to do is stand,
and pray that Alan is easy to convince.

36:56.155 --> 36:58.824
- Diana.
- It's okay.

36:58.907 --> 37:00.951
Just do as they tell you, okay?

37:03.495 --> 37:05.289
Tell Alan to stall.

37:11.086 --> 37:13.630
You guys grabbed the wrong girl,
you know?

37:14.339 --> 37:18.385
You're gonna point that gun to my head
and Alan is going to yawn.

37:20.679 --> 37:22.806
He doesn't care about me.

37:22.889 --> 37:25.809
You might just as well have
kidnapped an eggplant.

37:28.353 --> 37:29.938
Come in, Miss Kellogg.

37:30.021 --> 37:32.566
Welcome to Rudolph Furst Enterprises.

37:34.776 --> 37:37.904
Megs, I care about you.
What are you talking about?

37:39.906 --> 37:42.951
You guys bug the elevator around here
or something?

37:43.076 --> 37:45.328
I choose to call it data gathering.

37:45.495 --> 37:48.248
It's amazing what you can learn
about what clients say...

37:48.331 --> 37:50.709
on their way up to the executive suite.

37:52.711 --> 37:55.338
How could you think
I didn't care about you?

37:55.422 --> 37:57.924
- What did I do?
- Alan.

37:58.341 --> 37:59.843
That's right, Alan.

38:00.302 --> 38:03.847
You care about her.
And that's precisely why she's here.

38:04.472 --> 38:06.933
You guys don't fool around, do you?

38:10.812 --> 38:15.608
Of all the girls they could've brought here,
they had to bring up the one that I love.

38:17.026 --> 38:19.112
It's my fault. I'm sorry, Meg.

38:24.659 --> 38:28.621
Okay, I'll tell you everything
you wanna know. Bring me to the lab.

38:30.373 --> 38:32.208
Just do what they say. Come on.

38:32.292 --> 38:36.671
Come along, everyone.
The Explo formula awaits rediscovery.

38:40.925 --> 38:42.427
Put that thing away!

38:50.184 --> 38:54.230
You see? An exact replica
of the lab you were in two nights ago...

38:54.856 --> 38:57.817
complete with all your
cleaning implements.

38:59.068 --> 39:03.614
Now, all you will have to do is
simply recreate the explosion.

39:05.866 --> 39:07.493
Oh, Alan.

39:08.828 --> 39:11.872
Stall. There's someone downstairs
trying to help us.

39:17.169 --> 39:20.214
There'll be plenty of time
for sweet nothings later.

39:21.132 --> 39:24.218
Please, Mr. Akroy. Begin cleaning.

40:02.423 --> 40:04.383
What time is it, do you know?

40:05.717 --> 40:07.219
Shortly after 11:00.

40:08.303 --> 40:09.429
Really?

40:10.556 --> 40:13.725
Oh, good. I guess
I can have my little laugh now.

40:14.059 --> 40:17.729
Seeing as how the real Alan Akroy
should have arrived at the IADC...

40:17.813 --> 40:19.815
about 5, 10 minutes ago.

40:20.023 --> 40:22.734
- What?
- You heard me.

40:23.610 --> 40:26.446
The Alan Akroy you have is a fake, darling.

40:27.239 --> 40:28.365
You're bluffing.

40:28.448 --> 40:32.411
You should have seen the look
on the real Alan's face this morning...

40:32.494 --> 40:36.123
when we made the switch
at the airport. He's a really funny guy.

40:36.665 --> 40:40.293
- I don't believe you.
- It really doesn't matter in the least.

40:40.377 --> 40:44.214
By morning the IADC
will have the Explo formula.

40:45.507 --> 40:49.010
And what you'll have is something
resembling strawberry soda.

40:49.719 --> 40:51.429
And I say you're lying.

40:53.181 --> 40:55.850
But it wouldn't hurt
to get a second opinion.

41:03.108 --> 41:04.442
Gently.

41:11.282 --> 41:12.742
Don't forget your coat.

41:32.011 --> 41:35.223
Too much. I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to start over again.

41:36.391 --> 41:38.977
Now, look,
you said you wanted everything...

41:39.060 --> 41:42.438
just the same way it was in that other lab
before it exploded, right?

41:42.522 --> 41:44.023
You're gonna have to trust me.

41:44.107 --> 41:47.694
I'm sure that this cleaning solution
is crucial, okay?

41:50.947 --> 41:52.031
Please.

42:37.827 --> 42:38.953
You again.

42:39.036 --> 42:42.289
Diana Prince and I aren't exactly thrilled
with you, either.

42:42.373 --> 42:44.875
Allow me to pick a floor.

42:59.848 --> 43:02.434
I'm trapped in here!
I'm trapped on the first floor!

43:02.518 --> 43:04.061
Can you get me out ofhere?

43:12.402 --> 43:15.489
Hey, listen. You guys don't really want me
to do this, do you?

43:15.572 --> 43:19.576
If these chemicals are the same, this place
is gonna go up like a matchbook.

43:19.660 --> 43:23.497
As you'll recall, the explosion
resulted from a chain reaction.

43:23.956 --> 43:26.833
We'll have plenty of time,
once the reaction starts...

43:26.917 --> 43:29.044
to get that beaker over here
to this chamber...

43:29.127 --> 43:31.546
where the explosion can be contained.

43:32.130 --> 43:34.257
Please continue, Mr. Akroy.

43:35.008 --> 43:36.134
Right.

43:39.846 --> 43:43.433
You know what? This isn't the same kind
of squirt bottle. It won't work.

43:43.517 --> 43:45.435
You're stalling, Mr. Akroy!

43:45.519 --> 43:48.772
Everything is identical to the way
it was in the lab that night.

43:48.855 --> 43:51.441
We were watching, remember?

43:53.360 --> 43:54.986
- Tom.
- No. wait.

43:55.070 --> 43:58.448
Look. I'll do it exactly the way
I did it, I promise. Okay.

43:59.199 --> 44:02.452
Here we go. I always start
at the far side of the room, you know.

44:02.535 --> 44:04.621
Left to right, so I'll remember where I am.

44:04.704 --> 44:07.999
I was spraying the counter.
Cleaned off the counter. Just like that.

44:08.083 --> 44:12.587
Nothing happened. Came over to here.
Just sort of cleaned off the counter.

44:13.046 --> 44:16.299
Here, and then... And I...

44:18.676 --> 44:22.347
This is where I...

44:47.705 --> 44:49.707
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

44:50.375 --> 44:53.378
Why didn't you call the police,
instead of running?

44:53.503 --> 44:55.004
No one wanted to hurt you.

44:55.088 --> 44:57.882
Hey, listen. The last time
I came clean about something...

44:57.965 --> 45:00.176
was when I totaled my father's car.

45:00.384 --> 45:03.304
- What, and he grounded you for a month?
- A year.

45:03.679 --> 45:06.057
Listen, he didn't tell
those two guys anything.

45:06.140 --> 45:07.225
Good.

45:07.308 --> 45:10.645
Because I don't think they're ready
to learn what Alan knows.

45:10.728 --> 45:13.773
In fact, I don't think anyone's ready.

45:14.565 --> 45:16.734
- I can make you forget.
- No!

45:17.235 --> 45:19.862
- Yeah!
- No, we must have that secret!

45:21.238 --> 45:22.323
Please!

45:24.116 --> 45:27.912
I can make you forget everything
that happened last Wednesday night.

45:27.995 --> 45:29.080
Fantastic!

45:30.164 --> 45:33.292
Hey, listen. This is the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

45:33.376 --> 45:35.419
I mean, almost the greatest.

45:35.503 --> 45:37.671
He's telling the truth, you know?

45:50.893 --> 45:54.188
Diana, what I should've had
Wonder Woman make him forget was...

45:54.271 --> 45:57.441
Barbara and Susan and Cheri and Kia.

45:58.233 --> 46:00.486
Are you sure you can't stay for dinner?

46:00.569 --> 46:02.946
Alan would be so surprised
if you were here.

46:03.030 --> 46:05.240
No, I really am on my way to the airport.

46:05.324 --> 46:08.327
I just checked in to see
if Alan worked everything out.

46:08.410 --> 46:10.829
Yeah. Everybody was very understanding:

46:10.913 --> 46:12.915
the police, the insurance companies...

46:12.998 --> 46:16.960
except for the people at Hopewell
International and Furst Enterprises.

46:17.044 --> 46:19.671
I don't think they're ever
gonna forgive Wonder Woman...

46:19.755 --> 46:21.757
for doing what she did to Alan.

46:22.633 --> 46:26.553
Those two companies carried
the spirit of competition a little too far.

46:26.637 --> 46:28.472
They needed to be taught a lesson.

46:28.555 --> 46:31.475
By the way, how are things
working out with you and Alan?

46:31.558 --> 46:34.937
Oh, terrific. You know what he said
up there in that office?

46:35.020 --> 46:38.231
He said I was the only girl
he ever cared about.

46:38.482 --> 46:42.027
I guess it took all those other girls
to make him realize that.

46:42.736 --> 46:44.154
Come on, Ronnie, up here.

46:44.237 --> 46:47.532
I really appreciate you doing this
for me. I hope you've got time.

46:47.616 --> 46:51.161
I have plenty of time.
Just a little nervous about all this.

46:51.870 --> 46:54.915
- Megs, what are you doing here?
- Cooking you dinner.

46:55.499 --> 46:57.667
It was supposed to be a surprise.

46:57.793 --> 46:58.919
I had no idea...

46:59.002 --> 47:02.047
however, that you were going to be
bringing dessert!

47:03.507 --> 47:08.303
Or maybe I should just call her
Number Six, okay?

47:08.386 --> 47:12.057
Hey, listen! She answered an ad
from the newspaper!

47:12.140 --> 47:14.476
She's gonna water my plants
while we're gone.

47:14.559 --> 47:17.145
- Gone where?
- On our honeymoon.

47:19.397 --> 47:21.691
Alan, you've never asked me to marry you.

47:21.775 --> 47:23.777
You never asked me to ask you.

47:24.444 --> 47:26.780
You never asked me to ask you to ask me.

47:26.863 --> 47:30.450
You never asked me to ask you
to ask you to ask me.

47:30.617 --> 47:32.869
But you never asked me to ask you-

47:32.952 --> 47:34.579
You never asked me to ask you-

47:34.662 --> 47:36.414
You never... Why don't you ask?

47:36.498 --> 47:38.458
- Okay.
- Alan.

47:40.752 --> 47:42.045
So I'm asking.

47:42.253 --> 47:44.547
So, okay, I will.
