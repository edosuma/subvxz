WEBVTT

02:36.240 --> 02:37.532
I've taken your castle.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.577
- Theon?
- It's Prince Theon now.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.996
Get up. You have to get dressed.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.208
I've taken Winterfell.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.585
I took it. I'm occupying it.

02:49.878 --> 02:52.755
I sent men over the walls
with grappling claws and ropes.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.675
- Why?
- To take the castle.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.345
- You went with Robb.
- And he sent me back to Pyke.

03:00.681 --> 03:04.225
I'm a Greyjoy.
I can't fight for Robb and my father both.

03:06.019 --> 03:08.020
- Where's Hodor?
- I don't know.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.231
Find the halfwit.

03:10.983 --> 03:14.360
My men are bringing your people
together in the courtyard.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.904
- Why?
- So you and I can go down and tell them

03:16.989 --> 03:19.615
- how you've yielded Winterfell to me.
- I won't.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.535
Yes, you will.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.079
I won't. I'll never yield.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.415
We'll fight you and throw you out.

03:33.297 --> 03:35.047
The castle is mine.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.258
But these people are still yours.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.510
You'll yield to keep them safe,

03:39.595 --> 03:41.304
to keep them alive.

03:42.306 --> 03:44.223
That's what a good lord would do.

03:47.811 --> 03:50.438
Think carefully about what you want to say.

03:53.609 --> 03:54.775
Theon.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.028
Did you hate us the whole time?

04:05.495 --> 04:07.622
I've yielded Winterfell to Theon.

04:07.706 --> 04:08.831
Louder.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.000
Say Prince Theon.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.086
I've yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.838
You all know me.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.591
Aye, we know you for a steaming sack of shit.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.343
Farlen, you be silent.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.137
Listen to your little lord, Farlen.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.306
He has more sense than you do.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.475
All of you should do as he commands.

04:27.559 --> 04:31.020
My father has donned
the ancient crown of Salt and Rock

04:31.438 --> 04:34.440
and declared himself King of the Iron lslands.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.027
He claims the North as well
by right of conquest.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.613
- You are all his subjects.
- Bugger that.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.531
I serve the Starks.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.952
- If you think you can hold the North with it...
- Shut up!

04:46.036 --> 04:49.497
If you serve me as loyally
as you served Ned Stark,

04:49.581 --> 04:52.083
- I will be as good to you as he ever was.
- Steady.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.293
Betray me, and you will wish you hadn't.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.465
Maester Luwin, send a raven to Pyke

04:59.549 --> 05:02.051
informing my father of my victory here.

05:02.678 --> 05:04.720
And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister.

05:05.639 --> 05:09.058
Inform her that she's to bring
500 men to Winterfell.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.147
You are a maester of the Citadel,

05:15.232 --> 05:18.192
sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell,
are you not?

05:18.819 --> 05:19.819
I am.

05:20.070 --> 05:23.280
I am the Lord of Winterfell
as Bran just informed you.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.742
Send the ravens.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.663
My lord.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.583
My Lord Greyjoy.

05:36.253 --> 05:39.630
I see you've finally learned
how to address your betters.

05:40.632 --> 05:41.674
What do you want?

05:41.758 --> 05:43.843
I was brought here a captive.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.262
You were here the day I was taken.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.931
I'm the one who took you. What of it?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.309
Let me serve you.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.645
Serve me how?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.273
I need fighters, not kitchen sluts.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.109
It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.320
Put a spear in my hand again.

06:03.780 --> 06:07.324
So you can bury it in my neck?
Do you take me for a fool?

06:07.868 --> 06:09.035
Get up.

06:09.578 --> 06:10.995
Step aside.

06:12.789 --> 06:13.873
Why?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.251
It's your dream, little lord.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.671
The ocean has come to swallow this place.

06:21.131 --> 06:22.214
I ain't letting it drown me.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.716
You'll all go about
your tasks as usual.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.302
- And in a few days' time...
- Greyjoy!

06:34.019 --> 06:37.229
We caught this one on his way back
from Torrhen's Square.

06:37.314 --> 06:40.024
Took out two of ours before I got his sword.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.527
Ser Rodrik, it grieves me that we meet as foes.

06:43.779 --> 06:47.198
It grieves me you've less honor
than a back alley whore.

06:47.657 --> 06:50.326
You were raised here under this roof.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.412
- These people are your people.
- They are not my people.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.623
King Robb thought of you as a brother.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.626
My brothers are dead.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.796
They died fighting Stark men, men like you.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.091
Aye, they died fighting a war
your father started.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.259
Lord Stark raised you among his own sons.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.595
Among them, but not one of them.

07:09.679 --> 07:12.389
I was his hostage, taken from my home.

07:12.474 --> 07:13.724
If he were alive to see this...

07:13.809 --> 07:15.643
He's not. He's dead.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.479
The Seven Kingdoms are at war.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.231
And Winterfell is mine.

07:20.732 --> 07:24.485
I should have put a sword in your belly
instead of in your hand.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.780
You've served this house faithfully, old man.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.615
But keep talking and I'll...

07:32.202 --> 07:34.161
Take him to the cells. Lock him up...

07:34.246 --> 07:35.579
My prince.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.791
You cannot let that stand. He must pay.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.751
I'll lock him in a cell until he rots.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.796
No, he has to pay the iron price.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.341
They'll never respect you while he lives.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.236
Ser Rodrik,

08:07.320 --> 08:08.779
I sentence you to death!

08:08.864 --> 08:11.365
No! You said no harm
would come to them if I yielded.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.576
The old man couldn't keep his mouth shut.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.579
I urge you not to make a hasty decision.

08:17.622 --> 08:19.331
He disrespected me
in front of my men.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.083
That was his decision, not mine.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.460
He is worth more to you alive than dead.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.921
The Starks will pay.

08:27.382 --> 08:31.093
Please, Theon, think what you do.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.524
You'll address me as Prince Theon
or you'll be next.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.110
Come.

08:48.945 --> 08:49.945
No!

08:50.697 --> 08:52.615
- No!
- Theon!

08:56.912 --> 08:58.162
Rodrik!

08:59.080 --> 09:01.665
He who passes the sentence
should swing the sword.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.834
- I'm begging you.
- Coward.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.378
Stop.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.464
Stop! Stop right now!

09:10.133 --> 09:12.176
You don't give commands anymore, little lord.

09:12.260 --> 09:15.387
- Please, stop this. Please stop him.
- Hush now, child.

09:15.472 --> 09:17.139
I'm off to see your father.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.936
You said no harm would come!

09:22.854 --> 09:25.439
You said no harm would come. Theon, please.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.233
Any last words, old man?

09:28.652 --> 09:31.487
Gods help you, Theon Greyjoy.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.322
Now you are truly lost.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.575
Theon, please don't. Do something!

09:36.826 --> 09:38.994
I'll do anything, please!

09:39.079 --> 09:40.412
No, please stop it!

10:12.821 --> 10:14.196
Ghost, stay with us.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.365
Ghost!

10:16.741 --> 10:18.075
There goes your pet.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.327
He's not a pet.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.329
No, you're right, he's not.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.081
You can't tame a wild thing.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.834
You can't trust a wild thing.

10:26.918 --> 10:29.503
- Ghost is different.
- So you think.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.631
Wild creatures have their own rules,

10:32.716 --> 10:34.508
their own reasons.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.260
And you'll never know them.

10:37.887 --> 10:40.347
Now the wildlings we're looking for

10:40.432 --> 10:42.308
sleep during the day and hunt at night.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.521
I thought you said
you couldn't know wild things.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.231
I said you can't.

10:49.774 --> 10:52.776
They find a nice cave to hide in
while the sun's up

10:52.861 --> 10:54.486
and do their killing when it's dark.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.196
We could do the same.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.531
No, we couldn't.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.950
This is their country.

11:00.035 --> 11:02.828
They know where to walk, where not to walk.

11:02.912 --> 11:06.707
I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse
they didn't see till they were in it.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.836
My father always said I'm of the North.

11:12.630 --> 11:15.257
- I wasn't joking.
- Look around, boy.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.510
This look like home to you?

11:19.054 --> 11:22.181
You start thinking you know this place,
it will kill you.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.933
You understand me?

11:25.769 --> 11:27.269
No, you don't.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.396
We're at war.

11:30.440 --> 11:31.440
We've always been at war.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.068
It's never going to end
'cause we're not fighting an enemy.

11:34.152 --> 11:37.613
We're fighting the North,
and it's not going anywhere.

11:37.989 --> 11:40.449
The Watch has given you a great gift.

11:40.909 --> 11:43.535
You only have one thing to give in return,

11:43.620 --> 11:44.578
your life.

11:44.662 --> 11:48.624
- I'll gladly give my life.
- I don't want you to be glad about it.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.544
I want you to curse and fight
until your heart's done pumping.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.255
And know this, boy.

11:55.632 --> 11:58.759
Your death will be a gift
for them south of the Wall.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.178
They'll never know what you've done.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.182
They'll never know how you died.
They won't even know your damn name.

12:05.266 --> 12:08.060
But they'll be alive because
some nameless bastard

12:08.144 --> 12:10.646
north of the Wall gave his life for theirs.

12:11.815 --> 12:14.483
Now, do you understand me?

12:15.735 --> 12:16.777
I do.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.612
You're even dumber than you look.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.241
It's just words, boy,

12:22.325 --> 12:24.118
to keep us a little warmer in the night.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.287
Make us feel like we've got a purpose.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.748
Come on.

12:29.833 --> 12:33.419
We've got to find these goat fuckers
before night falls and they find us.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.975
- Can you read?
- My lord?

12:49.352 --> 12:50.853
Can you read?

12:54.941 --> 12:57.276
This letter detailing our infantry movements

12:57.360 --> 12:59.862
was meant for Lord Damon
of House Marbrand.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.699
It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.576
My apologies, my lord. I must have...

13:05.660 --> 13:09.037
Girl, fetch me the History of the
Greater and the Lesser Houses.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.998
It's the one on this...

13:15.378 --> 13:17.713
My cupbearer can read better than you.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.267
To whom does House Dormand
owe allegiance?

13:33.062 --> 13:34.688
My lord, l...

13:34.772 --> 13:37.483
To the Starks of Winterfell!

13:38.067 --> 13:41.737
Who have 20,000 men and my son!

13:43.573 --> 13:47.951
I judged you might be good for something
more than brutalizing peasants.

13:48.286 --> 13:50.287
I see I overestimated you.

13:51.831 --> 13:55.334
If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll...

13:56.753 --> 13:57.753
Leave us.

14:05.929 --> 14:07.346
Put the book away, girl.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.814
Maybe you should devise our next battle plan
while you're about it.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.405
Lord Petyr Baelish.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.490
Mmm.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.284
Give us the room.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.377
Clear all this.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.675
- Lord Tywin.
- Baelish.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.310
- Wine?
- Thank you.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.190
What news from the capital?

15:00.275 --> 15:03.652
I traveled here directly
from Renly Baratheon's camp.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.737
Ah, the late King Renly.

15:06.531 --> 15:08.365
Rather a short reign.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.284
Murdered by a woman, I hear.

15:10.368 --> 15:12.286
So they say.

15:12.370 --> 15:17.082
There has been talk of other forces at work.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.501
Dark forces.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.212
Here.

15:25.300 --> 15:29.094
Men love to blame demons
when their grand plans unravel.

15:30.680 --> 15:36.184
It is my belief that a moment of chaos
affords opportunities lost soon after.

15:36.269 --> 15:39.688
You say that as if you were
the first man alive to think it.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.773
Yes, a crisis is an opportunity.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.776
What other brilliant insights
have you brought me today?

15:44.861 --> 15:48.614
After the Lannisters and the Starks,
the Tyrells command the largest host.

15:48.698 --> 15:50.782
Their lands are the most fertile
in the Seven Kingdoms,

15:50.867 --> 15:54.828
- feeding horses and soldiers.
- Yes, yes, yes.

15:54.912 --> 15:58.332
The Tyrells have not yet declared
for any of the surviving kings.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.961
Loras wants revenge.
He blames Stannis for Renly's death.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.213
And Margaery...

16:05.757 --> 16:07.174
Wants to be queen.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.301
Yes, she does.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.514
House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne.

16:15.350 --> 16:17.976
- Against my grandson.
- They did.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.480
And perhaps that treason should be punished

16:21.564 --> 16:23.190
one day,

16:23.274 --> 16:26.526
after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.073
More wine for Lord Baelish.

16:37.497 --> 16:40.832
If you will allow me to
represent your family's interests,

16:40.917 --> 16:43.335
I believe that an advantageous agreement...

16:43.419 --> 16:45.879
The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?

16:45.963 --> 16:47.339
They have.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.509
Pardon, my lord.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.260
It's only wine.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.639
You would ride there yourself?

16:55.723 --> 16:57.474
Tonight, with your leave.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.309
I'll have an answer by nightfall.

16:59.394 --> 17:00.977
That'll be all, girl.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.777
And what else?

17:08.903 --> 17:10.695
On your son Tyrion's directive,

17:10.780 --> 17:12.823
I met with Catelyn Stark.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.866
Why?

17:14.951 --> 17:19.162
He had an interesting proposal for her
concerning her daughters.

17:19.247 --> 17:20.288
Hmm.

18:10.298 --> 18:12.591
- A girl.
- A wildling.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.594
We could question her.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.804
You could.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.139
She won't answer.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.934
I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue
instead of talking.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.938
- What's your name?
- Ygritte.

18:27.023 --> 18:30.066
She was reaching for this ax
when you got to her.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.652
Give her half a chance,
she'll bury it in your face.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.864
I gave you my name.

18:37.825 --> 18:38.825
I'm Jon Snow.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.211
You ought to burn them you killed.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.171
We'd need a big fire for that.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.716
Tell me, Ygritte.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.511
Why do you want us to build a big fire?

18:58.596 --> 19:00.639
Are there some more friends in the area?

19:01.098 --> 19:04.059
Burn them or maybe
you'll need those swords again.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.812
Our boy here's already killed one dead man.

19:06.896 --> 19:09.272
He can do it again if he has to.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.608
What waits beyond the pass?

19:12.193 --> 19:13.735
- The free folk.
- How many?

19:16.072 --> 19:17.739
Hundreds and thousands.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.116
More than you've ever seen, crow.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.994
Why come to the mountains?

19:23.913 --> 19:26.456
What's in the Frostfangs
your king could want?

19:34.882 --> 19:36.424
Do you mean to march on the Wall?

19:43.140 --> 19:44.641
Do you know who I am, girl?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.227
Qhorin Halfhand.

19:47.895 --> 19:48.895
Tell me true.

19:50.481 --> 19:52.566
If your people captured me,

19:52.984 --> 19:54.317
would they take me prisoner?

19:54.986 --> 19:58.446
They'd take your head off your shoulders
if they was feeling kind.

19:58.990 --> 20:01.074
If not, they'd kill you slow.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.538
We have no food for her.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.874
Can't spare a man to watch her.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.168
Can't let her go.
She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.046
- It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
- No.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.592
No, I'll do it.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.012
Come, brothers.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.306
We'll leave him to it.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.600
We'll meet you at the top.

20:26.684 --> 20:28.351
Don't take too long.

20:28.436 --> 20:29.644
We're deep in their country now.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.869
You never killed a woman before, did you?

20:46.704 --> 20:48.663
You don't need to do it.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.750
Mance would take you. I know he would.

20:52.335 --> 20:54.210
There's secret ways.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.546
The crows would never catch us.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.925
I'm as much a crow as they are.

21:12.313 --> 21:13.939
Will you burn me?

21:14.565 --> 21:16.191
After?

21:16.817 --> 21:18.234
Can't.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.529
Someone might see the smoke.

21:27.244 --> 21:29.579
Strike hard and true,

21:29.664 --> 21:30.872
Jon Snow,

21:32.208 --> 21:33.708
or I'll come back and haunt you.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.547
That's cold.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.469
Go on.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.471
Be quick about it.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.730
Do it.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.360
Bastard, do it!

23:16.562 --> 23:19.147
You can't do it. We both know it.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.197
The sun's going down, Jon Snow.

23:27.281 --> 23:29.282
And your friends are nowhere close.

23:30.034 --> 23:31.159
I'll find them.

23:32.453 --> 23:34.579
Call for them. Go on.

23:34.997 --> 23:36.372
Call loudly.

23:44.090 --> 23:47.092
May the Seven guide the princess
on herjourney.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.469
May the Mother give her health.

23:50.012 --> 23:52.013
May the crone give her wisdom.

23:52.556 --> 23:55.058
May the warrior give her courage.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.607
One day I pray you love someone.

24:03.484 --> 24:05.527
I pray you love her so much,

24:06.195 --> 24:08.238
when you close your eyes, you see her face.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.033
I want that for you.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.579
I want you to know
what it's like to love someone,

24:17.456 --> 24:19.374
to truly love someone.

24:20.876 --> 24:23.086
Before I take her from you.

24:40.229 --> 24:42.981
You sound like a little cat
mewling for his mother.

24:43.065 --> 24:44.440
Princes don't cry.

24:44.608 --> 24:47.235
- I saw you cry.
- Did you say something, my lady?

24:48.237 --> 24:50.822
My little brother cried when I left Winterfell.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.323
So?

24:52.408 --> 24:53.908
It seems a normal thing.

24:54.952 --> 24:56.536
Is your little brother a prince?

24:56.620 --> 24:57.704
No.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.081
Not really relevant then, is it?

25:04.295 --> 25:05.628
Come, dog.

25:14.138 --> 25:16.014
Hail Joffrey!

25:16.098 --> 25:17.891
Hail to the King.

25:20.436 --> 25:22.520
Seven blessings on you, Your Grace.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.397
Murderer! Bastard!

25:24.607 --> 25:25.899
All hail the King.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.401
He's no king. He's a bastard!

25:29.820 --> 25:31.654
Please, Your Grace, we're hungry.

25:34.450 --> 25:35.867
Freak.

25:35.951 --> 25:37.619
Get the Prince back to the Keep now.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.621
Yes, my lord. Come, quickly.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.998
Please, Your Grace,
give us some food!

25:42.082 --> 25:44.167
Bread, Your Grace, please!

25:47.671 --> 25:49.797
Who threw that?

25:49.882 --> 25:51.382
I want the man who threw that.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.218
Find who did that and bring him to me!

25:53.302 --> 25:55.428
- Hold on!
- Hold them back!

25:55.512 --> 25:57.388
Just kill them! Kill them all!

26:03.187 --> 26:05.855
- Move. Move!
- Pull back!

26:05.981 --> 26:07.232
Tear him to pieces!

26:07.316 --> 26:10.109
What are you doing?
I want these people executed!

26:10.194 --> 26:12.028
And they want the same for you.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.307
Where's Sansa?

26:44.311 --> 26:46.521
- Through the door.
- Come on.

26:46.730 --> 26:47.981
Push hard.

26:52.361 --> 26:53.945
Protect the king!

26:54.029 --> 26:56.114
- Get back!
- Fall back!

27:12.715 --> 27:13.881
Keep him safe!

27:13.966 --> 27:15.341
Brotherfucker!

27:16.552 --> 27:18.386
- Watch out.
- Hold them back.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.520
Hey.

27:29.523 --> 27:30.773
Traitors!

27:31.066 --> 27:34.235
- I'll have all their heads.
- You blind, bloody fool.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.321
You can't insult me.

27:36.405 --> 27:39.490
We've had vicious kings
and we've had idiot kings,

27:39.575 --> 27:42.160
but I don't know if we've ever been
cursed with a vicious idiot for a king.

27:42.244 --> 27:43.786
- You can't...
- I can, I am.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.330
They attacked me!

27:45.414 --> 27:49.042
They threw a cow pie at you,
so you decided to kill them all?

27:49.126 --> 27:50.835
They're starving, you fool.

27:50.919 --> 27:52.253
All because of a war you started.

27:52.338 --> 27:54.047
You're talking to a king!

27:55.257 --> 27:57.175
And now I've struck a king.

27:57.259 --> 27:58.718
Did my hand fall from my wrist?

28:00.471 --> 28:01.763
Where is the Stark girl?

28:01.847 --> 28:03.014
Let them have her.

28:03.098 --> 28:06.559
If she dies, you'll never
get your Uncle Jaime back.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.395
You owe him quite a bit, you know.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.739
Where are you going?

28:21.742 --> 28:23.951
You ever been fucked, little girl?

28:25.287 --> 28:26.704
Come here.

28:27.456 --> 28:29.123
Take some men and go and find the Stark girl.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.334
I take my orders from the king.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.336
- Where?
- This way.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.178
Please!

28:43.430 --> 28:44.722
No! No!

29:03.992 --> 29:05.118
Please!

29:08.997 --> 29:11.499
You're all right now, little bird.
You're all right.

29:26.140 --> 29:27.682
We'll get you. We'll get you.

29:28.392 --> 29:29.600
This way.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.813
Are you hurt, my lady?

29:33.897 --> 29:37.066
The little bird's bleeding.
Someone take her back to her cage.

29:37.151 --> 29:39.360
- See to that cut.
- Well done, Clegane.

29:41.238 --> 29:42.697
I didn't do it for you.

29:45.325 --> 29:46.909
He shouldn't make me wait.

29:47.411 --> 29:50.872
The Spice King is
the second wealthiest man in Qarth.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.374
He makes everyone wait.

29:53.876 --> 29:56.669
Of course, you could have
avoided this embarrassment

29:56.753 --> 29:59.505
if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.340
I already have a husband.

30:01.425 --> 30:03.551
Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi.

30:04.386 --> 30:07.138
You are far too young to be a widow forever

30:07.222 --> 30:10.183
and far too beautiful.

30:10.267 --> 30:14.228
And you are far too smart
to think that I will succumb to flattery.

30:14.938 --> 30:17.356
I have traveled very far in my life

30:17.441 --> 30:19.150
and met many women,

30:19.234 --> 30:20.902
but none that are immune to flattery.

30:21.069 --> 30:23.738
The Mother of Dragons!

30:23.822 --> 30:25.531
Here he comes.

30:25.616 --> 30:28.951
Forgive me. I had terrible dreams last night.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.745
Terrible dreams.

30:31.538 --> 30:34.123
I could not sleep until the sun was shining

30:34.249 --> 30:36.334
and the birds were singing.

30:37.044 --> 30:39.462
Look what a beauty you are

30:39.546 --> 30:41.756
now the Red Waste has been washed off you.

30:42.424 --> 30:45.593
I am sorry about all that unpleasantness.

30:46.094 --> 30:49.764
The silver hair of a true Targaryen.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.350
Xaro Xhoan Daxos,

30:52.434 --> 30:55.937
she is far too lovely for
a glorified dockworker like yourself.

30:56.021 --> 30:59.482
Very true, and yet they say
that your grandfather,

30:59.566 --> 31:01.692
who sold pepper off the back of a wagon,

31:01.777 --> 31:05.112
married a lady far lovelier
and higher born than himself.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.406
Every lady alive was lovelier

31:07.491 --> 31:09.700
and higher born than my grandfather.

31:11.787 --> 31:15.373
Did my servants not offer you
something to eat, to drink?

31:15.457 --> 31:16.749
I'll have them flogged in the square.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.210
Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host,

31:19.294 --> 31:21.796
but there is no servant alive
that can bring me what I want.

31:22.506 --> 31:24.382
Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one.

31:25.259 --> 31:28.719
So, my little princess, what is it you want?

31:29.054 --> 31:30.263
My birthright.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.139
The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.

31:32.683 --> 31:35.101
I fear I'm no better
than a servant in this regard.

31:35.185 --> 31:37.186
I cannot give you what I do not have.

31:37.271 --> 31:39.939
I'm not asking you for the kingdoms.

31:40.023 --> 31:41.524
I'm asking you for ships.

31:41.608 --> 31:43.109
I need to cross the Narrow Sea.

31:43.193 --> 31:44.944
I need my ships as well.

31:45.028 --> 31:48.614
I use them, you see,
to bring spices from one port to another.

31:48.699 --> 31:50.616
Whatever you grant me now will be repaid

31:50.701 --> 31:53.160
three times over
when I retake the Iron Throne.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.287
Retake?

31:55.122 --> 31:57.081
Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?

31:57.165 --> 31:59.834
My father sat there, before he was murdered.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.253
But if you did not sit on it yourself,

32:02.337 --> 32:05.673
would it not be correct
to say "take the Iron Throne"?

32:06.049 --> 32:07.925
I didn't come here to argue grammar.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.511
Of course not. You came to take my ships.

32:11.680 --> 32:14.765
So let me explain my position, little princess.

32:15.726 --> 32:19.020
Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.771
I make my living by trade.

32:20.856 --> 32:23.733
And I judge every trade on its merits.

32:24.318 --> 32:25.901
You ask for ships.

32:25.986 --> 32:28.738
You say I shall be repaid triple.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.782
I do not doubt your honesty
or your intentions.

32:32.409 --> 32:34.118
But before you repay your debts,

32:34.202 --> 32:36.537
you must seize the Seven Kingdoms.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.956
- Do you have an army?
- Not yet.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.583
You do not have an army.

32:41.043 --> 32:43.336
Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?

32:43.420 --> 32:45.296
There are many there that support my claim.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.422
When were you there last?

32:47.883 --> 32:49.342
I left when I was a baby.

32:50.093 --> 32:52.178
So, in truth, you have no allies.

32:52.429 --> 32:56.682
The people will rise to fight for
their rightful queen when I return.

32:56.892 --> 32:57.892
Ah.

32:59.102 --> 33:00.311
Forgive me, little princess,

33:00.395 --> 33:03.898
but I cannot make an investment
based on wishes and dreams.

33:04.358 --> 33:05.399
Now if you'll pardon me.

33:05.484 --> 33:08.069
Do you know lllyrio Mopatis,
Magister of Pentos?

33:08.570 --> 33:10.905
Yes, we've met. A shrewd man.

33:10.989 --> 33:14.241
For my wedding, he gave me
three petrified dragon eggs.

33:14.409 --> 33:19.163
He believed... The world believed
that the ages had turned them to stone.

33:19.289 --> 33:22.667
How many centuries has it been
since dragons roamed the skies?

33:22.751 --> 33:25.503
But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs

33:25.587 --> 33:27.922
into a great fire, they would hatch.

33:28.465 --> 33:32.343
When I stepped into the fire,
my own people thought I was mad.

33:32.803 --> 33:35.137
But when the fire burned out,

33:35.222 --> 33:37.056
I was unhurt,

33:37.140 --> 33:39.392
the Mother of Dragons.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.188
Do you understand?

33:47.609 --> 33:49.485
I'm no ordinary woman.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.488
My dreams come true.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.620
I admire your passion.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.458
But in business, I trust in logic, not passion.

34:05.335 --> 34:07.044
I'm sorry, little princess.

34:07.129 --> 34:08.838
I am not your little princess.

34:09.297 --> 34:12.341
I am Daenerys Stormborn
of the blood of Old Valyria,

34:12.426 --> 34:14.217
and I will take what is mine.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.679
With fire and blood, I will take it.

34:16.763 --> 34:20.433
Yes, my lady, but not with my ships.

34:39.202 --> 34:41.454
Who taught you to read?

34:41.788 --> 34:43.664
My father, my lord.

34:43.748 --> 34:44.748
Hmm.

34:46.208 --> 34:48.168
I taught my son Jaime to read.

34:51.214 --> 34:54.507
The maester came to me one day,
told me he wasn't learning.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.303
He couldn't make sense of the letters.

34:58.013 --> 34:59.805
He reversed them in his head.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.976
The maester said he'd heard tell
of this affliction

35:04.060 --> 35:06.228
and that we simply must accept it.

35:06.313 --> 35:07.313
Ha!

35:08.732 --> 35:14.320
After that, I sat Jaime down
for four hours every day until he learned.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.365
He hated me for it, for a time.

35:19.743 --> 35:21.452
For a long time.

35:22.496 --> 35:24.038
But he learned.

35:25.457 --> 35:26.457
Hmm.

35:29.169 --> 35:31.629
Where is your father? Is he alive?

35:35.217 --> 35:36.425
Who was he?

35:36.968 --> 35:39.178
A stonemason.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.514
A stonemason who could read?

35:41.640 --> 35:42.640
Hmm.

35:42.724 --> 35:43.849
He taught himself.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.519
Quite a man.

35:47.938 --> 35:49.396
What killed him?

35:51.900 --> 35:53.150
Loyalty.

35:55.403 --> 35:57.238
You're a sharp little thing, aren't you?

36:01.076 --> 36:02.117
Did...

36:04.412 --> 36:06.872
Forgive me, my lord.
I shouldn't ask questions.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.583
No.

36:10.794 --> 36:12.586
But you've already begun.

36:14.631 --> 36:16.632
Did you know your father, my lord?

36:18.260 --> 36:19.426
I did.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.055
I grew up with him.

36:25.141 --> 36:27.434
I watched him grow old.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.356
He loved us.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.608
He was a good man,

36:36.111 --> 36:37.736
but a weak man.

36:38.363 --> 36:41.615
A weak man who nearly destroyed
our house and name.

36:44.286 --> 36:45.536
I'm cold.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.747
I'll fetch more wood for the fire, my lord.

36:48.874 --> 36:49.874
Mmm.

37:17.819 --> 37:19.194
Where are you going, girl?

37:20.113 --> 37:22.031
The armory, my lord.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.492
- Why?
- Lord Tywin sent me.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.663
What might this be?

37:30.498 --> 37:32.499
Lord Tywin gave it to me.

37:33.627 --> 37:34.877
What for?

37:35.503 --> 37:37.379
To take to the armory.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.049
Why would he do that?

37:42.969 --> 37:44.303
Let's go and ask him.

37:46.640 --> 37:47.640
Move!

37:50.435 --> 37:52.019
Get out of the way!

38:22.801 --> 38:24.176
Amory Lorch.

38:25.095 --> 38:26.971
A girl has named a second name.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.305
A man will do what must be done.

38:28.390 --> 38:29.431
Now!

38:30.725 --> 38:33.560
A girl cannot tell a man
when exactly he must do a thing.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.480
A man cannot make a thing
happen before its time.

38:36.564 --> 38:38.232
But he's going to tell Tywin.
He's getting away.

38:38.316 --> 38:39.900
It has to be now.

38:48.702 --> 38:49.910
Guard!

39:00.088 --> 39:02.381
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

39:07.095 --> 39:08.846
My honor, Your Grace.

39:08.930 --> 39:10.389
Your Grace.

39:16.646 --> 39:18.397
- Your Grace.
- Quent.

39:40.336 --> 39:41.837
Lady Talisa.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.631
Your Grace.

39:46.134 --> 39:47.760
I'm not sure I'm a lady.

39:47.844 --> 39:50.304
Westerosi customs are
still a bit foreign to me.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.264
It's hard to keep all the rules straight.

39:52.348 --> 39:55.559
But if I remember my lessons,

39:55.643 --> 39:58.437
a woman of noble birth
is always called a lady.

39:58.521 --> 40:01.231
Unless she's a queen or a princess.

40:01.316 --> 40:02.816
I could find someone who knows.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.110
Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?

40:05.945 --> 40:07.279
Because it's obvious.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.283
What if I told you my father
sold lace on the Long Bridge,

40:11.367 --> 40:13.827
and my mother, my brother and I
lived with him above our shop?

40:15.997 --> 40:17.414
I'd call you a liar.

40:17.499 --> 40:20.167
Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty.

40:24.964 --> 40:26.340
I always thought I was a brilliant liar.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.384
Better at amputations, I'm afraid.

40:35.391 --> 40:37.184
Quite a pretty spot.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.852
Will we be here long?

40:39.562 --> 40:41.855
I couldn't really discuss
troop movements with you.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.067
I'm not a spy.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.319
Of course, a spy would deny being a spy.

40:49.030 --> 40:51.740
You're right. You've found me out.

40:51.825 --> 40:55.369
I'm writing a letter to the Lannisters.
"The young wolf is on the move."

40:57.872 --> 40:59.206
Perhaps you'd join me.

41:01.042 --> 41:03.710
If you've got time, of course, for, well...

41:03.795 --> 41:04.795
Robb.

41:07.465 --> 41:08.632
Mother.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.891
Mother, this is Lady Talisa.

41:18.685 --> 41:20.269
She's been helping with the wounded.

41:20.353 --> 41:22.980
She's been very helpful.

41:24.149 --> 41:26.233
- Lady Talisa.
- Lady Stark.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.694
Lady Talisa...

41:29.195 --> 41:31.071
- Maegyr.
- Maegyr?

41:32.323 --> 41:34.867
Forgive me, I do not know this name.

41:35.285 --> 41:37.786
An uncommon name here.
An old name in Volantis.

41:39.038 --> 41:41.331
Excuse me, my lady. Your Grace.

41:51.050 --> 41:52.509
I've missed you.

41:52.969 --> 41:55.971
Yes, you look positively forlorn.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.098
You surprised me, that's all.

41:59.559 --> 42:01.560
I didn't think I'd see you today.

42:02.353 --> 42:04.521
I wish that you were free to follow your heart.

42:04.606 --> 42:06.023
I know.

42:06.107 --> 42:08.734
You have inherited
your father's responsibilities.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.737
I'm afraid they come at a cost.

42:11.821 --> 42:14.948
- You are promised to another.
- I know.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.243
A debt that must be paid.

42:19.662 --> 42:23.248
- I haven't forgotten.
- Your Grace. My lady.

42:23.625 --> 42:25.375
News from Winterfell.

42:38.181 --> 42:39.890
Your brothers desert you?

42:41.309 --> 42:42.809
I can tell you which way to go.

42:44.479 --> 42:46.063
We'll stop here.

42:46.147 --> 42:47.981
Too dark to go any farther today.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.609
Here? There's no shelter here.

42:50.693 --> 42:52.069
There's no shelter anywhere.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.738
There is...
if you know where to look.

42:58.451 --> 43:00.202
The cold could kill us both.

43:00.286 --> 43:02.496
- If you light a fire...
- No fire.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.706
- But a fire is...
- No fire.

43:07.835 --> 43:09.419
Have it your way.

43:17.053 --> 43:19.513
We'll stay warmer if we stay close.

43:21.808 --> 43:24.226
Bet you freeze to death before I do.

43:25.687 --> 43:26.979
Bet your life.

43:52.922 --> 43:54.881
Think they're out looking for you?

43:56.384 --> 43:58.427
- Yes.
- Think they'll find you?

44:00.263 --> 44:01.346
Yes.

44:04.017 --> 44:05.559
You're brave.

44:07.270 --> 44:08.395
Stupid,

44:09.147 --> 44:10.355
but brave.

44:13.818 --> 44:16.820
We start again at first light. Get some sleep.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.504
Stop moving.

44:34.589 --> 44:36.423
I'm just trying to get comfortable.

44:38.217 --> 44:39.426
Stop it!

44:52.315 --> 44:54.191
- You're still moving.
- Was I?

44:55.109 --> 44:57.110
I didn't notice that time.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.540
This cannot be true.

45:10.625 --> 45:12.709
We've had ravens from White Harbor,

45:12.794 --> 45:14.753
Barrowton and the Dreadfort.

45:14.837 --> 45:16.129
I'm afraid it is true.

45:17.256 --> 45:19.049
Why? Why would Theon...

45:19.133 --> 45:21.510
Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores.

45:22.303 --> 45:25.055
- My brothers?
- We've heard nothing of them.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.975
But Rodrik Cassel is dead.

45:30.895 --> 45:32.979
I told you, never trust a Greyjoy!

45:36.484 --> 45:38.235
I must go north at once.

45:38.319 --> 45:40.028
There's still a war to win, Your Grace.

45:40.113 --> 45:43.198
How can I call myself king
if I can't hold my own castle?

45:43.282 --> 45:46.118
- How can I ask men to follow me if I can't...
- You are a king.

45:46.452 --> 45:49.037
And that means you don't have
to do everything yourself.

45:49.372 --> 45:50.872
Let me go and talk to Theon.

45:50.957 --> 45:52.916
There will be no talk. He will die for this.

45:54.502 --> 45:57.212
Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew.

45:57.296 --> 45:59.881
Let me send word to
my bastard at the Dreadfort.

45:59.966 --> 46:03.927
He can raise a few hundred men and retake
Winterfell before the new moon.

46:04.011 --> 46:06.638
We have the Lannisters on the run.

46:07.306 --> 46:10.934
If you march all the way back north now,
you'll lose what you gained.

46:11.686 --> 46:15.230
My boy would be honored
to bring you Prince Theon's head.

46:16.524 --> 46:19.818
Tell your son Bran and
Rickon's safety is paramount.

46:20.194 --> 46:22.654
And Theon, I want him brought to me alive.

46:24.657 --> 46:27.200
I want to look him in the eye and ask him why.

46:27.285 --> 46:29.453
And then I'll take his head myself.

46:30.163 --> 46:33.457
Why on earth would I trust the word
of a lying little savage like you?

46:33.541 --> 46:35.000
I'm no liar.

46:36.711 --> 46:40.672
All wildlings are liars and savages
with no loyalty to anything or anyone.

46:40.756 --> 46:42.716
I done what I had to do to stay alive.

46:44.093 --> 46:46.261
I hate the Starks as well as you do.

46:46.387 --> 46:47.929
Let me serve you, my lord.

46:48.639 --> 46:51.600
How? And don't tell me
to put a spear in your hand.

46:52.059 --> 46:54.227
There are other ways to serve, my lord.

46:55.271 --> 46:59.733
- I'm a prince now, and you'd do well...
- There are other ways to serve, my prince.

47:04.530 --> 47:05.572
Like what?

47:08.534 --> 47:10.952
We know things, the free people.

47:11.954 --> 47:13.788
You know things?

47:15.041 --> 47:16.082
Like what?

47:16.167 --> 47:17.751
How to eat dirt?

47:19.879 --> 47:21.171
Other things.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.674
Savage things.

47:27.136 --> 47:28.470
Wait outside.

47:46.030 --> 47:47.781
I always wondered what you had under there.

47:49.408 --> 47:50.992
It comes at a price.

47:51.452 --> 47:53.119
I'm not killing you. That's your price.

47:53.204 --> 47:54.663
I already had that.

47:56.749 --> 47:58.166
What do you want then,

47:58.251 --> 47:59.834
other than your miserable life?

48:00.962 --> 48:02.462
What all free people want.

48:02.964 --> 48:04.339
My freedom.

48:09.929 --> 48:11.638
Well, you shall have it, then.

48:13.933 --> 48:16.184
But only if you serve me well.

48:22.567 --> 48:24.150
- Ow!
- Shh.

48:24.402 --> 48:27.195
- It's not deep.
- I thought they were going to kill me.

48:27.613 --> 48:29.406
They thought so, too.

48:29.490 --> 48:31.575
He hated me, the man who hit me.

48:31.701 --> 48:33.994
I saw it in his eyes. Hated me.

48:34.870 --> 48:38.623
He never met me before,
but he wanted to hurt me.

48:39.208 --> 48:42.085
- Of course he did.
- Why? Why would a stranger...

48:42.169 --> 48:44.379
You are everything he will never have.

48:44.463 --> 48:46.756
Your horse eats better than his children.

48:47.675 --> 48:49.676
It doesn't matter now. He's dead.

48:50.344 --> 48:52.512
I would have given them bread if I had it.

48:53.180 --> 48:55.223
I hate the king more than any of them.

48:55.891 --> 48:57.392
Don't say these things.

48:57.476 --> 48:58.560
If the wrong people hear you...

48:58.644 --> 49:00.645
But you're not the wrong people.

49:06.652 --> 49:08.403
Don't trust anybody.

49:08.696 --> 49:10.488
Life is safer that way.

49:51.989 --> 49:53.698
And where are you going?

49:56.243 --> 49:58.662
I have something for you from Prince Theon.

49:58.746 --> 50:00.705
- What?
- Me.

50:04.251 --> 50:06.294
He says I'm to make the rounds.

50:12.927 --> 50:14.719
And keep you warm.

50:42.498 --> 50:45.917
The Spice King refuses me
because I'm a bad investment.

50:46.043 --> 50:49.379
The Silk King won't support me
because of his business with the Lannisters.

50:49.463 --> 50:51.464
Why offend his best customer?

50:51.590 --> 50:55.009
And the Copper King offers me a single ship

50:55.094 --> 50:57.721
on the condition that I lie with him for a night.

50:57.805 --> 51:00.682
Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?

51:01.559 --> 51:04.477
When I came to this city, I had nothing.

51:05.104 --> 51:06.813
Truly nothing.

51:07.648 --> 51:09.399
I slept by the docks.

51:09.483 --> 51:12.402
And when I could find work
loading the ships, I would eat.

51:12.486 --> 51:14.529
If not, I dreamed of food.

51:15.156 --> 51:17.782
Today, I am the richest man in Qarth.

51:18.617 --> 51:23.037
Do you think the path from poverty to wealth
is always pure and honorable?

51:24.373 --> 51:28.376
I have done many things, Khaleesi,
that a righteous man would condemn.

51:29.670 --> 51:32.756
And here I am, with no regrets.

51:45.895 --> 51:48.855
Bar the gates. Ring the bells.

51:49.982 --> 51:51.274
Slowly, Khaleesi.

52:01.702 --> 52:03.036
Where are they?

52:10.461 --> 52:12.253
Where are my dragons?
