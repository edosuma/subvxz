WEBVTT

00:06.715 --> 00:09.559
Orchestrations
were arranged by Sir Rhodri Fanning

00:09.635 --> 00:13.105
and Dame Evelyn Blish is a member
of the Kings Lynn players.

00:13.680 --> 00:18.277
<i>$0 tune in again next week for more
from the What's My Line? team.</i>

00:18.727 --> 00:22.072
And that brings us to the end
of programming for today.

00:22.648 --> 00:27.700
So, from all of us here at Alexandra
Palace, a very good night.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.996
£200 overdrawn.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.793
I need a miracle.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.604
He's a caution, that one.
He does make me laugh.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.358
Oh, our lord and master.

01:01.478 --> 01:03.776
- Rita, I'm off out.
- Dad.

01:04.438 --> 01:07.192
Oh, how many times, son? We'll see.

01:07.276 --> 01:10.155
But everyone's getting a telly, Dad,
even Mr Gallagher.

01:10.279 --> 01:12.577
And the Bells at number 67.

01:13.323 --> 01:15.667
Well, perhaps we'll get one
for the Coronation.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.291
If you're lucky. We'll see.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.414
Don't wait up.

01:20.497 --> 01:24.127
I heard they rot your brains.
Rot them into soup

01:24.209 --> 01:27.338
and your brain comes pouring
out of your ears.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.298
That's what television does.

01:52.529 --> 01:53.906
MI' Magpie?

01:54.573 --> 01:56.951
- Oh, Mr Magpie?
- Eh?

01:58.327 --> 02:01.501
- Whoo-/100! Can you hear me, Magpie?
- Yes.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.720
- I must be dreaming.
- Oh, no. This isn't a dream.

02:08.211 --> 02:11.556
- I'm going doolally, then.
- Not at all, sweetheart.

02:11.673 --> 02:14.927
Now, are you sitting comfortably?

02:15.344 --> 02:18.188
Good, then we 'll begin.

03:16.279 --> 03:19.032
I thought we'd be going for the Vegas era.

03:19.116 --> 03:22.290
You know, the white flares
and the chest hair.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.121
You are kidding, aren't you?

03:24.204 --> 03:26.332
If you wanna see Elvis,
you go for the late '50s.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.174
The time before burgers!

03:28.250 --> 03:30.969
When they called him "The Pelvis"
and he still had a waist!

03:31.044 --> 03:33.263
What's more, you see him in style!

03:41.513 --> 03:43.311
You going my way, doll?

03:43.473 --> 03:47.694
Is there any other way to go, daddy-o?
Straight from the fridge, man!

03:48.061 --> 03:50.280
He)!' you speak the lingo!

03:50.355 --> 03:54.986
Yeah, well, me and Mum, Cliff Richard
movies every Bank Holiday Monday.

03:55.110 --> 03:58.114
Cliff! I knew your mother
would be a Cliff fan.

04:02.159 --> 04:05.333
- Where we off to?
- Ed Sullivan TV studios.

04:05.454 --> 04:08.503
Elvis did Hound Dog on one of the shows.
There were loads of complaints.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.508
Bit of luck, we’ll just catch it.

04:10.584 --> 04:14.760
And that would be the TV studios in,
what, New York?

04:14.838 --> 04:16.214
That's the one!

04:21.803 --> 04:23.771
Digging that New York vibe!

04:23.847 --> 04:28.978
Well, this could still be New York.
I mean, this looks very New York to me.

04:30.687 --> 04:34.442
- London-y New York, mind, but...
- What are all the flags for?

04:44.826 --> 04:49.878
Smashing! Smashing, innit?

04:51.124 --> 04:53.798
You'd have thought
they was in the room with ya, eh?

04:53.877 --> 04:57.723
Fair do's, Tommy, you had a point.
New television.

04:58.548 --> 05:02.769
There, that should cheer you up a bit, Rita?
Give us a smile, then, eh?

05:02.844 --> 05:05.848
I can't. Nothing's the same anymore.
Not with her...

05:05.931 --> 05:08.935
- Stop going on about it!
- But her face, Eddie.

05:09.851 --> 05:13.071
What happened to her? That awful face.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.898
I said stop it!

05:20.570 --> 05:24.996
She's awake. I think she's hungry.

05:25.909 --> 05:29.834
There you go, sir.
All wired up for the great occasion.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.915
Great occasion? What do you mean?

05:31.998 --> 05:34.717
Where you been living, out in the colonies?

05:34.793 --> 05:36.966
The Coronation of course!

05:37.045 --> 05:39.264
And what Coronation's that, then?

05:39.548 --> 05:42.176
What do you mean? The Coronation!

05:42.717 --> 05:45.721
It's the Queen's! Queen Elizabeth!

05:46.763 --> 05:50.609
- Oh! Is this 1953?
- Last time I looked.

05:50.767 --> 05:54.237
Time for a lovely bit of
pomp and circumstance. What we do best.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.907
Look at all the TV aerials.
Looks like everyone's got one.

05:58.024 --> 06:02.029
That's weird. My mum said tellies were so
rare, they all had to pile into one house.

06:02.112 --> 06:05.116
Not round here, love.
Magpie's Marvellous Tellies.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.370
- Only five quid a pop!
- Oh, but this is a brilliant year, classic!

06:10.120 --> 06:15.092
Technicolor! Everest climbed!
Everything off the ration!

06:15.166 --> 06:17.510
A nation throwing off the shackles of war

06:17.627 --> 06:20.506
and looking forward to a happier,
brighter future!

06:20.839 --> 06:23.683
Someone help me, please! Ted!

06:23.758 --> 06:26.227
Leave him alone! That's my husband!

06:26.303 --> 06:28.647
- Please!
- What's going on?

06:29.681 --> 06:33.276
- Oi! What are you doing?
- Police business. Get out of the way, sir.

06:33.351 --> 06:37.072
- Who did they take? Do you know him?
- Must be Mr Gallagher.

06:40.483 --> 06:44.033
It's happening all over the place.
They're turning into monsters.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.992
Tommy! Not one word. Get inside now!

06:48.158 --> 06:50.581
Sorry, I'd better do as he says.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.795
All aboard!

07:02.881 --> 07:05.930
Operation Market Stall. Go! Go! Go!

07:24.527 --> 07:28.282
Lost them. How did they get away from us?

07:28.365 --> 07:30.959
I'm surprised they didn't turn back
and arrest you for reckless driving.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.877
Have you actually passed your test?

07:32.953 --> 07:35.752
Men in black? Vanishing police cars?

07:35.872 --> 07:38.716
This is Churchill's England,
not Stalin's Russia.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.465
Monsters, that boy said.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.510
Maybe we should go and ask
the neighbours.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.809
That's what I like about you,
the domestic approach.

07:47.884 --> 07:49.431
Thank you.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.396
Hold on. Was that an insult?

07:56.226 --> 07:59.730
I've finished it as you instructed.

08:02.148 --> 08:06.244
- That's awfully good of you, Mr Magpie.
- So you'll go soon?

08:06.528 --> 08:09.782
- You'll leave me?
- We 'll see.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.500
If you're a very good boy.

08:12.575 --> 08:17.001
Please. You're burning me. Inside.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.425
Behind my eyes. It hurts.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.090
Even my memories hurt.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.718
I just want things
back like they used to be.

08:25.797 --> 08:29.973
Oh, but this world of yours
is busy, busy, busy,

08:30.051 --> 08:33.179
forging ahead into a brand-new age.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.941
You can never go back. That's your tragedy.

08:37.683 --> 08:42.405
But now the time is almost riﬂe, Magpie.

08:43.106 --> 08:46.485
<i>Cometh the hour, cometh the man.</i>

08:49.863 --> 08:51.536
Or lady.

09:17.307 --> 09:21.733
Gran? Gran, it's me. It's Tommy.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.232
I'm gonna come in, Gran.

09:25.315 --> 09:28.615
Stand back. just don't...

09:30.278 --> 09:34.624
- I'm sorry, but I've got to come in.
- What do you think you're doing?

09:34.699 --> 09:37.293
We gotta try and help her, Dad.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.995
Give me that key.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.712
I said give me that key right now.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.225
And don't think I've finished with you.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.311
All the warnings I've given you
and every time,

09:55.386 --> 09:58.640
every time, you disobey me.

09:58.723 --> 10:03.069
- We can't just lock her away.
- Excuse me, sunshine, I am talking.

10:03.520 --> 10:06.114
And you can forget that college nonsense.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.408
You're gonna come and work alongside me.

10:08.483 --> 10:10.451
Get your hands dirty for once.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.243
Oh, Lord! Won't she ever stop?

10:16.574 --> 10:20.875
There, there, Rita, my sweet.
Business as usual.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.876
Now, let's get these up all over the house
in honour of Her Majesty.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.253
But, Eddie, what if she's dying?

10:28.378 --> 10:30.506
I am talking!

10:36.427 --> 10:38.054
That's better.

10:38.555 --> 10:40.273
A little bit of hush.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.729
- Hi!
'Hi!

10:46.813 --> 10:48.486
Who are you, then?

10:48.565 --> 10:51.614
Let's see, judging by the look of you,
family man, nice house, decent wage,

10:51.693 --> 10:54.071
fought in the war, therefore,
I represent Queen and country!

10:54.154 --> 10:57.234
Just doing a check of her forthcoming
Majesty's subjects before the great day.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.244
Don't mind if we come in?
No, I didn't think you did. Thank you.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.920
Not bad, very nice, very well kept.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.465
- I'd like to congratulate you, Mrs...?
- Connolly.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.292
Now then, Rita. I can handle this.

11:07.417 --> 11:11.672
This gentleman's a proper representative.
Don't mind the wife. She rattles on a bit.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.882
Well, maybe she should rattle on
a bit more.

11:13.965 --> 11:16.434
I'm not convinced you're doing
your patriotic duty.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.137
Those flags, why are they not flying?

11:20.054 --> 11:23.433
There we are, Rita, I told you.
Get them up. Queen and country.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.985
- I'm sorry.
- Get it done. Do it now.

11:26.060 --> 11:29.155
- Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute.
- Like the gentleman says...

11:29.230 --> 11:32.029
You've got hands, Mr Connolly.
Two big hands.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.282
- Then why is that your wife's job?
- Well, it's housework, innit?

11:35.361 --> 11:37.864
- And that's a woman's job?
- Course it is.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.791
Mr Connolly, what gender is the Queen?

11:41.618 --> 11:42.870
She's a female.

11:42.952 --> 11:46.081
And are you suggesting the Queen
does the housework?

11:48.958 --> 11:52.588
- No, not at all.
- Then get busy!

11:53.963 --> 11:55.806
Right. Yes, sir.

11:56.299 --> 12:01.305
You'll be proud of us, sir! We'll have
Union jacks left, right and centre!

12:01.804 --> 12:05.604
Excuse me, Mr Connolly. Hang on a minute.
Union jacks?

12:05.725 --> 12:08.524
- Yes, that's right, isn't it?
- That's the Union ﬂag.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.402
It's the Union jack
only when it's flown at sea.

12:11.481 --> 12:14.906
Oh, I'm sorry. I do apologise.

12:15.026 --> 12:18.781
Well, don't get it wrong again.
There's a good man. Now get to it!

12:22.367 --> 12:26.793
Right, then, nice and comfy.
At her Majesty's leisure!

12:26.955 --> 12:29.174
- Union ﬂag?
- Mum went out with a sailor.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.001
I bet she did.

12:31.125 --> 12:34.254
Anyway, I'm the Doctor and this is Rose.
And you are?

12:34.837 --> 12:37.431
- Tommy.
- Well, sit yourself down, Tommy.

12:39.008 --> 12:42.808
Have a look at this. I
love telly, don't you?

12:42.887 --> 12:45.390
- Yeah, I think it's brilliant.
- Good man.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.436
Keep working, Mr C!

12:49.560 --> 12:52.484
Now, why don't you tell me what's wrong?

12:53.398 --> 12:56.277
- Did you say you were a doctor?
- Yes, I am.

12:56.985 --> 13:01.536
Can you help her? Oh, please.
Can you help her, Doctor?

13:01.614 --> 13:04.242
Now then, Rita, I don't think
the gentleman needs to know.

13:04.325 --> 13:08.330
- Oh, the gentleman does.
- Tell us what's wrong, and we can help.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.380
It's all right. It's all right. Come here.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.591
Oh, its okay. It's all right.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.472
Hold on a minute.

13:19.257 --> 13:22.306
Queen and Country's one thing,
but this is my house.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.268
What the... What the hell am I doing?

13:26.055 --> 13:30.060
Now you listen here, Doctor.
You may have fancy qualifications,

13:30.143 --> 13:33.272
but what goes on under my roof
is my business.

13:33.396 --> 13:36.445
- Not if people are being bundled into...
- I am talking!

13:36.649 --> 13:39.778
And I'm not listening!

13:39.902 --> 13:41.324
Now you, Mr Connolly,

13:41.404 --> 13:44.453
you are staring into a deep, dark pit
of trouble if you don't let me help.

13:44.532 --> 13:48.036
So I'm ordering you, sir,
tell me what's going on!

13:54.625 --> 13:56.298
She won't stop.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.970
She never stops.

14:02.091 --> 14:05.470
We started hearing stories,
all round the place.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.106
People who have changed.

14:08.222 --> 14:11.192
Families keeping it secret
'cause they were scared.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.692
Then the police started finding out.
We don't know how, no one does.

14:14.771 --> 14:18.116
They just turn up.
They come to the door and take them.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.159
Any time of the day or night.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.281
Show me.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.578
Gran, it's Tommy.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.338
It's all right, Gran. I've brought help.

14:47.637 --> 14:50.265
Her face has completely gone.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.944
Scarcely an electrical impulse left.

14:55.019 --> 14:58.023
Almost complete neural shutdown.
It's just ticking over.

14:59.232 --> 15:03.453
It's like her brain's been wiped clean.

15:03.528 --> 15:06.623
What are we gonna do, Doctor?
We can't even feed her.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.917
- We've got company!
- It's them. They've come for her!

15:09.992 --> 15:12.336
What was she doing before this happened?
Where was she?

15:12.412 --> 15:15.382
- Tell me, quickly, think!
- I can't think. She doesn't leave the house.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.709
- She was just...
- Hold on a minute!

15:17.834 --> 15:20.963
There are three important,
brilliant and complicated reasons

15:21.045 --> 15:22.592
why you should listen to me.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.720
- One...
- Doctor!

15:26.008 --> 15:29.103
Leave her alone. You'll hurt her! Mum!

15:29.554 --> 15:32.148
Come back. Don't hurt her.

15:32.849 --> 15:35.068
- Back inside, Rita.
- She's my mother!

15:35.143 --> 15:36.816
Back inside now, I said!

15:39.021 --> 15:42.651
Hell of a right hook.
Have to watch out for that.

15:46.821 --> 15:49.449
Don't fight it. Back inside.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.955
- Rose, come on!
- Get back inside.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.879
- But they took her.
- Don't fight it.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.215
Rose! We're gonna lose them again!

16:00.293 --> 16:02.512
But they took her!
That was Gran and they took her!

16:02.587 --> 16:05.181
Come on, back inside, lad.

16:12.889 --> 16:16.189
How did they know?
How did they find her? Who told them?

16:17.310 --> 16:20.860
You! Get the hell out of my house!

16:20.938 --> 16:24.863
I'm going. I'm done.
Nice to meet you, Tommy.

16:25.318 --> 16:27.286
Mrs Connolly.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.368
And as for you, Mr Connolly,

16:30.448 --> 16:33.372
only an idiot hangs
the Union ﬂag upside down.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.749
Shame on you.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.570
Oh, very good.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.739
Very good.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.746
Stay where you are!

19:26.749 --> 19:31.300
I'm sorry, miss. I'm afraid you're too late.
I was just about to lock the door.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.756
Yeah? Well, I wanna buy a telly.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.639
- Come back tomorrow, please.
- You'll be closed, won't you?

19:38.594 --> 19:41.097
- What?
- For the big day?

19:41.931 --> 19:46.778
- The Coronation?
- Yes, yes, of course. The big day.

19:48.979 --> 19:52.449
I'm sure you'll find somewhere to watch it.
Please go.

19:52.608 --> 19:55.327
Seems to me
half of London's got a television,

19:55.444 --> 19:57.867
since you're practically giving them away.

19:57.947 --> 20:01.702
- I have my reasons.
- And what are they?

20:06.205 --> 20:08.048
<i>Hungry!</i>

20:09.125 --> 20:10.217
<i>Hungry!</i>

20:10.292 --> 20:13.387
- What's that?
- It's just the television.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.181
One of these modern programmes.

20:16.257 --> 20:20.228
Now, I really do think
you should leave right now.

20:21.470 --> 20:25.646
Not until you've answered my questions.
How comes your televisions are so cheap?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.773
It's my patriotic duty.

20:27.893 --> 20:32.114
Seems only right that as many folk
as possible get to watch the Coronation.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.740
We may be losing the Empire,
but we can still be proud!

20:35.818 --> 20:38.321
Twenty million people
they reckon will be watching.

20:38.446 --> 20:41.666
Imagine that.
And 20 million people can't be wrong, eh?

20:41.782 --> 20:45.286
So why don't you get yourself back home and
get up bright and early for the big day?

20:45.369 --> 20:48.088
No, I'm not leaving
till I've seen everything.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.086
I need to close.

20:53.210 --> 20:57.181
Mr Magpie,
something's happening out there.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.517
Ordinary people are being struck down
and changed

21:00.634 --> 21:03.683
and the only new thing in the house
is a television.

21:04.722 --> 21:08.397
Your television. What's going on?

21:11.187 --> 21:12.734
I knew this would happen.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.158
I knew I'd be found out.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.331
All right, then, just you and me.

21:32.541 --> 21:36.421
You gonna come clean, then?
What's really in it for you?

21:36.545 --> 21:39.674
For me? Perhaps some peace.

21:40.382 --> 21:42.885
- From what?
- From her.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.978
Well, that's just a woman on the telly.
That's just a programme.

21:48.057 --> 21:50.606
What a pretty little girl.

21:51.644 --> 21:54.648
- Oh, my God. Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.574
I'm talking to you, little one.

21:58.108 --> 22:01.908
Unseasonably chilly for the time of year,
don't you think?

22:02.905 --> 22:05.909
- What are you?
- I'm The Wire.

22:06.200 --> 22:10.580
And I'm hungry!

22:12.915 --> 22:14.633
Magpie, help me!

22:15.125 --> 22:17.753
Just think of that
audience tomorrow, my dear,

22:17.878 --> 22:20.757
all settling down to watch the Coronation.

22:20.840 --> 22:25.391
Twenty million people.
Things will never be the same again.

22:26.512 --> 22:29.015
I'm sorry. So sorry.

22:29.431 --> 22:30.683
Help me!

22:35.062 --> 22:37.941
Good night, children, everywhere.

22:39.275 --> 22:42.279
Start from the beginning.
Tell me everything you know.

22:42.653 --> 22:45.406
Well, for starters,

22:45.531 --> 22:47.954
I know you can't wrap your hand
round your elbow

22:48.075 --> 22:51.295
- and make your fingers meet.
- Don't get clever with me.

22:52.746 --> 22:56.626
You were there today at Florizel Street,
and now breaking into this establishment.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.838
Oh, you're connected with this.
Make no mistake.

22:59.920 --> 23:01.888
Well, the thing is,

23:01.964 --> 23:05.138
- Detective Inspector Bishop...
- How do you know my name?

23:05.259 --> 23:07.478
It's written inside your collar.

23:11.015 --> 23:13.734
Bless your mum. But I can't help thinking,

23:13.809 --> 23:18.815
Detective Inspector, you're not exactly
doing much detective-inspecting, are you?

23:18.939 --> 23:20.782
I'm doing everything in my power.

23:20.858 --> 23:24.658
All you're doing is grabbing those faceless
people and hiding them as fast as you can.

23:24.778 --> 23:27.076
Don't tell me, orders from above.

23:27.781 --> 23:30.409
Coronation Day, the eyes of the world
are on London Town,

23:30.492 --> 23:32.532
so any sort of problem
just gets swept out of sight.

23:32.578 --> 23:36.003
The nation has an image to maintain.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.421
But doesn't it drive you mad,
doing nothing?

23:38.500 --> 23:41.128
Don't you want
to get out there and investigate?

23:41.211 --> 23:43.054
Course I do.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.552
But...

23:47.009 --> 23:50.559
with all the crowds expected,
we haven't got the manpower.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.977
Even if we did,

23:53.098 --> 23:56.068
this is beyond anything we've ever seen.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.481
I just don't know anymore.

24:03.525 --> 24:07.996
Twenty years on the force,
I don't even know where to start.

24:08.072 --> 24:10.495
We haven't the faintest clue
what's going on.

24:10.574 --> 24:14.374
- Well, that could change.
- How?

24:18.082 --> 24:21.211
Start from the beginning.
Tell me everything you know.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.230
We started finding them
about a month ago.

24:40.354 --> 24:42.652
Persons left sans visage.

24:42.731 --> 24:45.154
Heads just... blank.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.986
Is there any sort of pattern?

24:47.069 --> 24:48.946
It's spreading out from North London,

24:49.029 --> 24:52.909
all over the city.
Men, women, kids, grannies.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.871
Only real lead is
there's been quite a large number in...

24:55.953 --> 24:57.580
Florizel Street.

24:57.705 --> 24:59.503
Found another one, sir.

24:59.581 --> 25:02.209
Oh, good man, Crabtree.
Here we are, Doctor.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.545
Take a good look.

25:05.087 --> 25:06.930
See what you can deduce.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.134
- Rose.
- You know her?

25:11.427 --> 25:13.429
Know her? She...

25:17.307 --> 25:21.107
They found her in the street apparently,
down by Damascus Road. just abandoned.

25:21.228 --> 25:25.074
That's unusual. That's the first one
out in the open...

25:25.733 --> 25:28.907
we'll have Torchwood
on our backs then, make no mistake.

25:28.986 --> 25:31.330
- They did what?
- I'm sorry?

25:32.239 --> 25:35.709
- They left her where?
- Just... in the street.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.247
In the street. They left her in the street.

25:39.329 --> 25:43.254
They took her face and just chucked her out
and left her in the street.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.630
And, as a result, that makes things...

25:48.964 --> 25:51.012
simple, very, very simple.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.224
- Do you know why?
- No.

25:54.303 --> 25:58.649
Because now, Detective Inspector Bishop,
there is no power on this Earth

25:58.766 --> 26:01.315
that can stop me! Come on!

26:06.857 --> 26:08.905
The big day dawns.

26:16.742 --> 26:19.086
You've had your fun with
your little Doctor.

26:19.161 --> 26:23.211
But now you're left with me, Rita,
so you'll behave yourself.

26:23.874 --> 26:25.091
And smile.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.721
Here we go, everyone, here we go!

26:29.838 --> 26:33.638
Grub's up. Grub's up. Tuck in, everyone.
Tuck in. Take a sandwich.

26:33.717 --> 26:36.971
Oh, here we go, it's starting.
Look, look. Go and take your places.

26:37.054 --> 26:40.024
Sit down. Sit down. There we are.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.892
In from' of the palace...

26:42.017 --> 26:46.864
Rita, love, just look at
that telly-box, then! Innit marvellous?

26:47.189 --> 26:49.191
The picture's so clear!

26:49.316 --> 26:52.411
Here, Bet, I says to Rita, I says,

26:52.528 --> 26:55.281
"You didn't need
to get your hair done special, love."

26:55.364 --> 26:58.208
"The Queen won't be able to see you!"

26:59.701 --> 27:02.955
Where's your old mum, then?
She can't go missing it.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.791
Sorry, Mum can't make it down.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.047
Aw, bless her.

27:08.335 --> 27:11.009
Maybe we could pop up and see her later.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.634
Maybe you could. It's a good idea.
What do you think, Dad?

27:14.716 --> 27:17.344
Maybe Aunty Betty can go
and see Gran later.

27:17.928 --> 27:20.477
Oh, he loves his Gran, this one.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.770
Proper little mummy's boy all round.

27:22.891 --> 27:25.485
Oh, you know what they say about them.

27:25.561 --> 27:27.859
Eddie, you want to beat that out of him.

27:27.938 --> 27:30.407
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

27:32.568 --> 27:33.865
I'll get it.

27:33.944 --> 27:36.618
Will first appear
in about 70 minutes' time

27:36.738 --> 27:39.708
riding in the gold coach of state.

27:41.118 --> 27:42.665
Tommy, talk to me.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.957
I need to know exactly what happened
inside your house.

27:46.707 --> 27:49.267
- What the blazes do you think you're doing?
- I wanna help, Dad!

27:49.334 --> 27:52.713
- Mr Connolly.
- Shut your face, you.

27:52.963 --> 27:55.933
Whoever you are.
We can handle this ourselves!

27:58.010 --> 28:00.388
Listen, you little twerp.

28:00.971 --> 28:04.692
You're hardly out of the blooming cradle
so I don't expect you to understand,

28:04.766 --> 28:07.315
but I've got a position to maintain.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.734
People round here respect me.

28:09.938 --> 28:12.282
It matters what people think.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.864
Is that why you did it, Dad?

28:16.737 --> 28:18.831
What do you mean? Did what?

28:18.947 --> 28:20.369
You ratted on Gran.

28:20.449 --> 28:22.577
How else would the police know
where to look?

28:22.659 --> 28:24.411
Unless some coward told them.

28:24.494 --> 28:26.588
How dare you?

28:26.997 --> 28:31.969
You think I fought a war
just so a mouthy little scum like you

28:32.044 --> 28:33.842
could call me a coward!

28:34.087 --> 28:37.682
You don't get it, do you?
You fought against fascism, remember?

28:38.467 --> 28:41.562
People telling you how to live.
Who you could be friends with.

28:41.637 --> 28:45.437
Who you could fall in love with.
Who could live and who had to die.

28:45.557 --> 28:48.561
Don't you get it? You were fighting
so that little twerps like me

28:48.644 --> 28:51.193
could do what we want, say what we want.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.236
Now you've become just like them.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.443
You've been informing on everyone,
haven't you?

28:55.525 --> 28:59.120
Even Gran.
All to protect your precious reputation!

28:59.196 --> 29:02.325
Eddie, is that true?

29:02.407 --> 29:04.501
I did it for us, Rita.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.960
She was filthy! A filthy disgusting thing!

29:09.706 --> 29:11.458
She's my mother.

29:13.502 --> 29:17.678
All the others you informed on,
all the people in our street, our friends.

29:18.340 --> 29:19.683
I had to.

29:22.469 --> 29:23.891
I did the right thing.

29:24.012 --> 29:27.141
The right thing for us or for you, Eddie?

29:30.352 --> 29:31.820
You go, Tommy.

29:31.895 --> 29:34.148
Go with the Doctor and do some good.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.609
Get away from this house. It's poison.

29:37.651 --> 29:40.029
We've had a ruddy monster
under our roof all right,

29:40.153 --> 29:41.871
but it weren't my mother!

29:43.699 --> 29:44.951
Rita!

29:45.242 --> 29:46.710
Tommy.

29:55.544 --> 29:58.172
- What was all that, then?
- That was...

29:58.255 --> 30:00.849
That was the sound of something ending.

30:00.924 --> 30:03.803
And about time, too. Everyone all right?

30:03.885 --> 30:05.387
Smashing.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.061
Nothing's gonna spoil our big day, is it?

30:14.771 --> 30:18.071
Tommy, tell me about that night,
the night she changed.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.244
She was just watching the telly.

30:21.236 --> 30:24.615
Rose said it. She guessed it straightaway.
Of course she did.

30:24.698 --> 30:26.792
All these aerials in one little street.
How come?

30:26.908 --> 30:29.036
Bloke up the road, Mr Magpie,
he's selling them cheap.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.962
- Is he, now?
- Come on!

30:32.080 --> 30:34.048
Here! You can't do that.

30:34.124 --> 30:35.546
Shop!

30:36.877 --> 30:40.723
If you're here,
come out and talk to me, Magpie!

30:40.797 --> 30:42.891
- Maybe he's out.
- Looks like it.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.437
Oh, hello.

30:48.138 --> 30:51.517
This isn't right. This
is very much not right.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.363
Tastes like iron. Bakelite.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.649
Knocked together with human hands, yes,

30:58.774 --> 31:00.367
but the design itself...

31:01.735 --> 31:04.955
Oh, beautiful work. That is so simple.

31:05.113 --> 31:08.458
That's incredible.
It's like a television, but portable.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.623
A portable television!

31:10.744 --> 31:13.372
It's not the only power
source in this room.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.475
Gran.

31:43.068 --> 31:44.615
I'm on my way-

31:47.489 --> 31:49.491
What do you think you're doing?

31:50.617 --> 31:52.961
I want my friend restored
and I think that's beyond

31:53.036 --> 31:56.666
a little backstreet electrician, so
tell me, who's really in charge here?

31:56.748 --> 31:59.718
Yoo-hoo. I think that must be me.

32:00.585 --> 32:04.055
Oh, this one's smart as palm'.

32:04.131 --> 32:05.599
Is she talking to us?

32:05.674 --> 32:08.644
I'm sorry, gentlemen, I'm afraid
you've brought this on yourselves.

32:08.718 --> 32:11.471
May I introduce you to my new friend.

32:11.555 --> 32:13.683
<i>Jolly nice to meet you.</i>

32:13.765 --> 32:16.518
Oh, my God, it's her.
That woman off the telly!

32:16.685 --> 32:19.063
- No. It's just using her image.
- What?

32:20.689 --> 32:22.908
- What are you?
- I'm The Wire.

32:23.733 --> 32:26.782
And I will gobble you up, pretty boy.

32:27.237 --> 32:29.456
<i>Every last morsel!</i>

32:29.531 --> 32:35.129
And when I have feasted,
I shall regain the corporeal body,

32:35.537 --> 32:37.960
which my fellow kind denied me.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.043
Good Lord. Colour television.

32:41.168 --> 32:44.843
- So your own people tried to stop you?
- They executed me,

32:44.921 --> 32:50.018
but I escaped in this form
and ﬂed across the stars.

32:50.177 --> 32:52.976
And now you're trapped in the television.

32:53.597 --> 32:55.565
<i>Not for much (anger.</i>

32:55.682 --> 32:57.776
Doctor, is this what got my gran?

32:57.851 --> 33:02.152
Yes, Tommy. It feeds off
the electrical activity of the brain,

33:02.230 --> 33:05.575
but it gorges itself
like a great, over-fed pig.

33:05.734 --> 33:08.954
Taking people's faces,
their essence as it stuffs itself.

33:09.196 --> 33:11.790
- And you let her do it, Magpie.
- I had to.

33:12.199 --> 33:13.667
She allowed me my face.

33:13.742 --> 33:16.871
She's promised to release me
at the time of manifestation.

33:16.953 --> 33:19.581
- What does that mean?
- The appointed time.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.541
My crowning glory.

33:21.625 --> 33:23.172
Doctor, the Coronation!

33:23.251 --> 33:27.347
For the first time in history,
millions gathered round a television set.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.930
But you're not strong enough yet, are you?

33:31.593 --> 33:33.561
You can't do it all from here.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.602
That's why you need this.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.608
You need something more powerful.

33:38.683 --> 33:42.108
This will turn a big transmitter
into a big receiver.

33:42.229 --> 33:44.652
What a clever thing you are.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.701
But why fret about it? Why not just relax?

33:47.776 --> 33:50.495
<i>Kick off your shoes
and enjoy the Coronation.</i>

33:50.612 --> 33:54.867
Believe me, you'll be glued to the screen.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.580
- Doctor!
- Hold on.

33:59.663 --> 34:01.165
<i>Hungry!</i>

34:01.498 --> 34:03.421
Hungry.

34:03.667 --> 34:08.797
The Wire is hungry! Oh, this one is tasty!

34:09.797 --> 34:14.349
Oh, I'll have lashings of him. Delicious!

34:14.803 --> 34:16.476
Ah!

34:16.554 --> 34:18.181
Armed?

34:18.306 --> 34:23.027
He's armed and clever.
Withdraw! Withdraw!

34:26.481 --> 34:29.485
The box, Magpie, the box!

34:33.405 --> 34:34.577
Hold tight!

34:36.658 --> 34:40.128
Conduct me to my victory, Magpie.

34:49.254 --> 34:52.849
Hungry! Hungry!

34:54.842 --> 34:56.844
Feed me!

34:57.429 --> 35:01.354
- Oh, she's so lovely!
- Beautiful.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.985
Makes you forget all your troubles.

35:04.978 --> 35:07.106
Everyone all right for pop?

35:14.779 --> 35:17.783
Tommy, wake up! Tommy, come on!

35:18.325 --> 35:21.169
- What happened?
- Where's Magpie?

35:23.038 --> 35:25.587
We don't even know where to start looking.
It's too late.

35:25.707 --> 35:28.836
Never too late, as a wise person once said.

35:28.918 --> 35:31.137
Kylie, I think. The Wire's got big plans.

35:31.212 --> 35:34.591
It'll need... Oh, yes, yes.
She's gonna harvest half the population.

35:34.716 --> 35:37.060
Millions and millions of people.
And where are we?

35:37.177 --> 35:40.772
- Muswell Hill.
- Muswell Hill. Muswell Hill! Which means...

35:41.890 --> 35:43.267
Alexandra Palace!

35:43.350 --> 35:45.648
Biggest TV transmitter
in North London. Oh!

35:45.727 --> 35:48.606
- What's why it chose this place, Tommy!
- What are you gonna do?

35:48.730 --> 35:50.732
I'm going shopping.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.041
This what you want?

36:06.039 --> 36:09.464
Perfect! Right, I need one more thing.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.854
Got it. Let's go.

36:34.317 --> 36:37.446
Her Majesty is wearing...

37:09.561 --> 37:11.108
I can't do this!

37:12.188 --> 37:14.441
Please! Please, don't make me.

37:14.524 --> 37:19.371
The time is at hand. Feed me!

37:19.696 --> 37:22.540
Feed me!

37:26.661 --> 37:27.878
There!

37:29.038 --> 37:30.290
Come on!

37:31.249 --> 37:34.799
Wait, wait, wait. Where do we think we...
Oh, I'm very sorry, sir.

37:34.878 --> 37:38.928
- Shouldn't you be at the Coronation?
- They' re saving me a seat.

37:39.007 --> 37:42.227
- Who'd he think you were?
- King of Belgium apparently.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.686
Will wait there a while.

37:47.766 --> 37:52.818
But he will go on
ahead of Her Majesty into the Abbey...

37:53.229 --> 37:54.856
Keep this switched on.

37:55.690 --> 37:59.866
Don't let anyone stop you, Tommy.
Everything depends on it, you understand?

38:02.989 --> 38:05.708
Her Majesty moves across...

38:14.459 --> 38:19.181
You'll get yourself killed up there!
Your Majesty!

38:42.070 --> 38:45.290
Feed me!

39:12.350 --> 39:14.944
Ah! Feast!

39:15.436 --> 39:20.442
Feasting! The Wire is feasting!

39:28.741 --> 39:32.291
It's too late. It's too late for all of us!

39:32.453 --> 39:35.832
I shall consume you, Doctor!

39:41.421 --> 39:43.423
I won't let you do this, Magpie!

39:43.506 --> 39:46.476
Help me, Doctor! It burns!

39:47.218 --> 39:49.641
It took my face,

39:49.721 --> 39:51.439
my soul!

39:51.514 --> 39:56.020
You cannot stop The Wire.
Soon, [shall become manifest.

39:59.439 --> 40:04.411
No more. No more of this.
You promised me peace.

40:04.485 --> 40:07.489
Then peace you shall have.

40:18.708 --> 40:20.802
Been burning the candle at both ends?

40:20.877 --> 40:23.300
You've over-extended yourself, missus.

40:23.463 --> 40:26.683
You shouldn't have had a crack
at poor old Magpie there.

40:32.847 --> 40:35.851
Rubber soles, swear by them.

40:43.524 --> 40:48.621
Oh, dear. Has our little plan
gone horribly wrong, Doctor?

40:57.872 --> 41:02.878
Coat of shimmering cloth of gold
lined with a crimson silk...

41:05.964 --> 41:08.092
are you willing to do the same?

41:11.886 --> 41:14.639
No!

41:27.402 --> 41:30.747
It's closed down, I'm afraid,
and no epilogue.

41:55.304 --> 41:58.524
- What have I missed?
- Doctor! What happened?

41:58.599 --> 42:02.274
Sorted. Electrical creature. TV technology.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.610
Clever alien life form.

42:04.731 --> 42:07.985
That's me, by the way. I turned the
receiver back into a transmitter

42:08.109 --> 42:10.487
and I trapped The Wire in here.

42:11.654 --> 42:14.624
I just invented the home video
30 years early.

42:16.451 --> 42:17.794
Betamax.

42:18.786 --> 42:20.254
Oh, look!

42:20.538 --> 42:23.212
God save the Queen, eh?

42:47.565 --> 42:52.617
Here's my grandson. Oh, son!
Oh, my goodness.

43:11.506 --> 43:15.227
This was never your house.
It's in my mother's name.

43:16.677 --> 43:19.476
And on her behalf, I'm telling you,

43:19.555 --> 43:20.898
out.

43:52.171 --> 43:54.549
We could go down the Mall,
join in with the crowds.

43:54.674 --> 43:57.473
No, that's just pomp and circumstance.

43:57.552 --> 44:00.726
- This is history, right here.
- The domestic approach?

44:00.847 --> 44:02.565
Exactly.

44:03.099 --> 44:07.445
Will it... That thing...
is it trapped for good on the video?

44:07.520 --> 44:08.737
Hope so.

44:08.813 --> 44:11.316
Just to be on the safe side, though,
I'll use my unrivalled knowledge

44:11.399 --> 44:15.199
of trans-temporal extirpation methods to
neutralise the residual electronic pattern.

44:15.278 --> 44:17.406
- You what?
- I'm going to tape over it.

44:17.530 --> 44:20.158
Just leave it to me. I'm always doing that.

44:20.241 --> 44:22.835
Tell you what, Tommy.
You can have the scooter. Little present.

44:22.910 --> 44:26.084
Best keep it in the garage
for a few years, though, eh?

44:27.957 --> 44:29.584
Good riddance.

44:32.420 --> 44:34.138
Is that it, then, Tommy?

44:35.173 --> 44:37.426
New monarch, new age, new world.

44:37.884 --> 44:40.728
- No room for a man like Eddie Connolly.
- That's right.

44:40.803 --> 44:42.555
He deserves it.

44:44.265 --> 44:46.108
Tommy, go after him.

44:46.601 --> 44:48.899
- What for?
- He's your dad.

44:49.270 --> 44:52.615
- He's an idiot.
- Course he is. Like I said, he's your dad.

44:53.608 --> 44:55.576
But you're clever,

44:55.651 --> 44:58.450
clever enough to save the world
so don't stop there.

45:00.489 --> 45:01.957
Go on.

45:42.281 --> 45:45.751
We've gone beyond the reach of
the Tardis' knowledge. Not a good move.

45:46.786 --> 45:48.083
Entering Nights/lift.

45:48.162 --> 45:50.756
This writing is old.

45:50.831 --> 45:52.208
Impossibly old.

45:52.708 --> 45:55.928
- People! Look at that, real people.
- That's us. Hooray!

45:56.003 --> 45:58.677
The Beast and his armies
shall rise from the pit...

46:00.508 --> 46:03.182
Whatever it is down there,
it's not a natural phenomenon.

46:03.386 --> 46:05.480
We could revolutionise modern science.

46:05.554 --> 46:07.807
We could use it to fuel the empire.

46:07.890 --> 46:09.733
Or start a war.

46:09.809 --> 46:12.983
- That's a black hole.
- But that's impossible.
