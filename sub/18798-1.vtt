WEBVTT

00:35.869 --> 00:40.456
Son Goku, next time,
I'll defeat you for sure!

00:53.011 --> 00:54.971
Who is it!?

01:07.067 --> 01:08.651
W- who are you!?

01:09.445 --> 01:11.237
Finish him!

01:22.875 --> 01:26.043
Piccolo and Kami are
of one body and mind.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.255
Now, Kami is dead, too.

01:32.092 --> 01:35.094
Piccolo has been beaten!
Was it Son Goku?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.263
No, it couldn't have been...

01:38.056 --> 01:41.225
I- it couldn't be!

01:54.907 --> 02:00.036
Break through the shining
clouds, and fly away (fly away)

02:00.037 --> 02:07.084
As a panorama spreads
itself throughout my being!

02:07.085 --> 02:12.507
The earth, having been kicked
in the face, gets angry (angry)!

02:12.508 --> 02:19.096
And makes one of
its volcanoes explode!

02:19.097 --> 02:25.937
If, within the thawed polar ice,

02:25.938 --> 02:34.946
There is a dinosaur, then I want
to train him to balance atop a ball.

02:34.947 --> 02:38.533
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

02:38.534 --> 02:47.542
No matter what may happen, I feel
as though nothing can bother me,

02:47.543 --> 02:50.962
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

02:50.963 --> 02:56.968
However hard your chest pounds,
the Genki Dama will roar!

02:56.969 --> 03:00.137
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

03:00.138 --> 03:07.895
The emptier your head is, the more
room there is to pack with dreams,

03:09.147 --> 03:12.567
CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA

03:12.568 --> 03:19.991
With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,
today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...

03:19.992 --> 03:21.284
Sparking!

03:42.014 --> 03:50.688
The 17-year cicada can have a larval
stage of 17 years or 13 years, huh?

03:51.189 --> 03:55.818
So they're in the ground for 17
whole years! That must be rough.

03:55.819 --> 04:01.240
Gohan-chan! Time to eat!

04:02.200 --> 04:04.827
Mother is in good spirits today.

04:10.626 --> 04:14.045
Hey! Gohan!

04:14.046 --> 04:15.922
It's Grandpa!

04:16.214 --> 04:18.048
Pa!

04:18.050 --> 04:20.635
Gohan, are you doin' all right?

04:20.636 --> 04:23.638
Mm-hmm!
You're looking good too, Grandpa.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.222
I'm fine, I'm fine!

04:25.223 --> 04:27.058
Here's some presents for you!

04:27.059 --> 04:28.643
Wow! Thank you!

04:28.644 --> 04:31.979
Chichi said that books would
make good presents for you,

04:31.980 --> 04:34.774
but they're so bulky to be carryin'.

04:36.652 --> 04:39.445
Pa, what are you kiddin' around for?

04:48.038 --> 04:50.623
Pa? What's the matter?

04:50.624 --> 04:52.333
Grandpa!

04:59.091 --> 05:00.925
Pa!

05:03.261 --> 05:04.553
Mother!

05:16.692 --> 05:19.568
W- who are you!?

05:20.696 --> 05:22.113
What do you want with us!?

05:22.114 --> 05:27.326
I've come for the Dragon Ball
on top of that kid's head.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.246
Gohan, get in the house!

05:30.247 --> 05:35.126
Mother!

05:35.127 --> 05:36.877
Hurry up!

05:39.297 --> 05:42.091
Mother!

05:53.729 --> 05:55.354
Gohan!

06:13.415 --> 06:15.374
Mother!

06:19.337 --> 06:20.629
Chichi!

06:22.340 --> 06:23.674
Mother!

06:24.342 --> 06:26.052
G- Gohan...

06:26.344 --> 06:29.388
Gohan... run away...

06:43.195 --> 06:45.237
Chichi!

06:47.199 --> 06:49.366
W- what happened, Chichi!?

06:50.786 --> 06:56.165
G- Goku-sa, Gohan
has been kidnapped...

06:56.166 --> 06:59.168
Gohan? Who took Gohan!?

06:59.169 --> 07:04.381
I don't know. They
came for the Dragon Ball...

07:04.382 --> 07:05.800
The Dragon Ball!?

07:05.801 --> 07:08.594
Where did they go!? Chichi!

07:15.393 --> 07:19.271
This makes five that we've
brought together, right?

07:19.815 --> 07:21.440
Yes, sir!

07:22.234 --> 07:24.777
Then there are two left.

07:26.238 --> 07:29.198
Ginger, once I have all seven together,

07:29.199 --> 07:31.408
I can ask of Shen Long and
receive eternal life, right?

07:31.409 --> 07:32.409
Yes, sir.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.786
Two more, huh?

07:33.787 --> 07:36.789
Once we learn the
location of the last two,

07:36.790 --> 07:39.583
the rest will be a piece of cake for us.

07:39.584 --> 07:44.588
Even Kami will die, but I will
become everlastingly immortal.

07:44.589 --> 07:48.467
That will be the first step of my revenge.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.637
The time has arrived when I
will plunge all living creatures

07:51.638 --> 07:56.267
on the face of the earth
into misery and despair!

08:00.480 --> 08:04.191
I want to go home now!

08:04.192 --> 08:07.862
Shut up! You be quiet, or
I'll never take you back!

08:07.863 --> 08:10.197
My father is going to come save me!

08:10.198 --> 08:13.659
My father is Son Goku, the
strongest person in the world!

08:13.660 --> 08:15.953
What's that? Son Goku?

08:15.954 --> 08:21.417
The same Son Goku that defeated Piccolo
Daimao in the Tenkaichi Tournament?

08:21.418 --> 08:24.461
That's right! I'm Son Goku's son!

08:26.506 --> 08:29.008
You're quite a crybaby, considering!

08:32.888 --> 08:36.307
And as for Piccolo, we defeated him, too.

08:36.308 --> 08:38.308
Yeah, and it was easy!

08:38.309 --> 08:40.686
He was a pushover!

08:48.320 --> 08:52.531
Impossible! I can sense a
mysterious power coming from him!

08:52.532 --> 08:55.326
I've never felt a power like this!

08:55.327 --> 08:58.871
Depending on how he is fostered,
he could be of great use to me.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.874
I know! I'll make you one of my attendants!

09:02.292 --> 09:03.459
An attendant?

09:04.878 --> 09:09.924
Wow, are you lucky! You got
off without getting killed!

09:11.009 --> 09:14.428
Grow stronger here, like these others!

09:14.429 --> 09:16.263
Stronger?

09:19.726 --> 09:22.937
It ain't Gohan they're after.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.521
It's the Dragon Balls.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.525
They've already gotten
five of them together.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.361
I'm sure that's where he must be.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.528
Here, huh?

09:31.529 --> 09:33.364
Mm-hmm, to the south.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.157
That's near the Crimson Sea.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.576
I'm going to borrow the Dragon Radar!

09:37.577 --> 09:38.911
Fine.

09:38.912 --> 09:43.499
Goku! These guys were able to beat
up Gyumao and Chichi with ease!

09:43.500 --> 09:44.500
Be on your guard!

09:44.501 --> 09:45.501
Right!

09:46.920 --> 09:48.921
Son-kun, be careful!

09:55.971 --> 09:56.971
Goku...

09:58.974 --> 10:00.599
Hold up!

10:00.600 --> 10:02.977
No way! I'm hopping around!

10:04.771 --> 10:09.775
That's enough! Why should I
have to baby-sit that brat!?

10:13.989 --> 10:15.155
Why, you...

10:17.575 --> 10:22.538
I'm thirsty. I'm hungry, too.

10:22.539 --> 10:25.374
Don't! You can't eat that!

10:25.375 --> 10:28.127
But you ate it.

10:32.382 --> 10:33.549
Delicious!

10:36.011 --> 10:37.428
Ah, that was delicious!

10:37.429 --> 10:39.805
When children eat those...

10:41.808 --> 10:44.226
...they become inebriated...

10:50.025 --> 10:51.608
Ah, geez...

10:59.034 --> 11:01.452
Hey, come on! Just- just a minute, now!

11:02.829 --> 11:09.793
Way, way, way up in the sky,
a whale was swimming along.

11:10.587 --> 11:17.509
He blew out up through his
spout, and it turned into rain.

11:18.470 --> 11:24.767
A thun- thun- thundercloud came along.
Oh, it's really an octopus!

11:26.478 --> 11:31.482
The sun was so surprised,
he roasted it all up!

11:31.483 --> 11:33.275
The sun was so surprised,
he roasted it all up!
Wait up, I tell you!

11:33.902 --> 11:39.948
Then a dinosaur ate the
octopus as it floated away.

11:41.659 --> 11:48.791
So good, so good, I don't know
why, but I feel so very good.

11:49.292 --> 11:56.423
So good, so, good, I don't
know why, but I'm so very glad.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.095
Hey! Be a good boy and stand still!

12:01.096 --> 12:01.678
And when I'm feeling good, I'm smart
as well! I can see other kinds of worlds!
Hey! Be a good boy and stand still!

12:01.679 --> 12:05.891
And when I'm feeling good, I'm smart
as well! I can see other kinds of worlds!

12:05.892 --> 12:09.103
And when I'm feeling good, I'm smart
as well! I can see other kinds of worlds!
He's no ordinary child, all right.

12:09.104 --> 12:19.696
I don't even have to study,
and I can see other cool worlds!

12:19.697 --> 12:24.034
I am the greatest
genius under the sun!

12:28.665 --> 12:30.874
Good grief, what a troublesome child!

12:36.089 --> 12:40.217
Garlic Jr-sama, here are the last two!

12:46.141 --> 12:52.604
This is all of them now, right? Then
let's have Shen Long grant my wish.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.576
There it is!

13:05.577 --> 13:07.161
Come forth, dragon!

13:16.546 --> 13:18.422
They're calling on Shen Long!

13:43.781 --> 13:46.783
Now, speak thy wish.

13:46.784 --> 13:51.205
I will grant thee any one wish.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.751
Give me eternal life!

13:55.752 --> 13:58.754
That is a simple matter.

14:21.236 --> 14:27.866
Miserable humans! As of now,
I am the ruler of the world!

14:28.826 --> 14:34.540
Evil spirits, lurking in the darkness,
as you are freed from your spells,

14:34.541 --> 14:37.793
be reborn from your subjugation!

14:37.794 --> 14:43.131
Rain blood mercilessly
over the entire world!

14:46.844 --> 14:50.889
I shall now reign over this
world, with no end to my life!

14:50.890 --> 14:57.854
Humans! This terror will continue
until every last one of you obeys me!

15:01.859 --> 15:06.697
I have granted thy wish.

15:06.698 --> 15:11.577
Farewell!

15:26.926 --> 15:31.888
Now, I have nothing left to fear! I
will carry out my father's vengeance,

15:31.889 --> 15:35.809
by killing all of the humans that
were given their light by Kami,

15:35.810 --> 15:41.023
and doing with this world as I please!

15:45.320 --> 15:47.946
Behold, our Garlic Jr-sama!

15:51.326 --> 15:53.910
Banzai! Banzai!

15:53.911 --> 15:55.329
Give me back my Gohan!

15:55.705 --> 15:57.706
Give me
back my Gohan!

16:02.295 --> 16:04.046
You must be Son Goku, right?

16:04.047 --> 16:05.714
That's right!

16:05.715 --> 16:09.092
You hurt Old Man Gyumao and Chichi!

16:11.512 --> 16:13.513
And we're going to hurt you, too!

16:13.514 --> 16:14.514
What?

16:26.944 --> 16:28.779
Kami!?

16:29.155 --> 16:31.156
You mean, Piccolo didn't die?

16:31.574 --> 16:34.576
Kami-sama, mind your own business!

16:34.577 --> 16:37.579
Ah, Son Goku, you're the same as ever.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.915
Welcome, Kami.

16:39.916 --> 16:44.336
So, it is you, Garlic. You've come
back after 300 years, have you?

16:44.337 --> 16:49.966
You'll use any means to accomplish
your schemes, just like your father.

16:49.967 --> 16:50.967
What?

16:50.968 --> 16:54.137
As was the father, so is the son.

16:54.138 --> 16:57.391
Indeed, your father competed
against me for the throne of Kami,

16:57.392 --> 17:00.811
but I was the one who
was chosen as successor.

17:00.812 --> 17:07.192
The previous Kami had seen
through Garlic's schemes.

17:12.824 --> 17:16.827
Dissatisfied with the decision,
Garlic rebelled against Kami,

17:16.828 --> 17:21.289
and as a result, he had his
power sealed away by Kami.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.049
His final words were that in 300 years,

17:31.050 --> 17:34.136
he would make certain
to take his revenge.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.555
But who would have thought
that he would be so vengeful

17:36.556 --> 17:38.974
as to entrust his retribution to his son?

17:38.975 --> 17:42.644
Hmph! If you hadn't
ascended to the throne of Kami,

17:42.645 --> 17:46.648
you wouldn't have to
die for my vengeance.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.024
This ain't got anything to do with me!

17:48.025 --> 17:49.651
Where is Gohan!?

17:49.652 --> 17:52.320
Your dirty brat is still asleep.

17:55.032 --> 17:57.075
Inside there?

18:00.997 --> 18:02.622
We won't allow it!

18:20.433 --> 18:21.808
Gohan!

18:25.104 --> 18:30.066
If you want to come up these stairs,
you'll have to defeat us first!

18:30.067 --> 18:33.278
Ginger, one of the Three Patrons of Garlic.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.489
Nikki, likewise.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.783
Sansho, likewise.

18:59.472 --> 19:00.889
All right, come on!

19:02.892 --> 19:04.434
Shogayaki!!

19:04.435 --> 19:06.019
Nodoame!!

19:06.020 --> 19:07.813
Unaju!!

19:47.562 --> 19:51.690
Not bad. You've gotten bigger, and
yet your speed has increased, too!

19:51.691 --> 19:53.316
Follow me!

19:59.991 --> 20:02.993
You think a Kami will die so easily?

20:02.994 --> 20:07.289
I have been given
eternal life by Shen Long.

20:07.290 --> 20:10.458
There is no way I can be beaten.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.962
Why you arrogant fool!

20:17.174 --> 20:20.010
That technique ain't going to work on me!

20:36.611 --> 20:38.570
Where is Gohan!?

20:49.999 --> 20:51.166
--What?
--What?

20:59.592 --> 21:01.009
Kuririn!

21:01.594 --> 21:03.762
You're acting pretty aloof, Goku!

21:09.018 --> 21:11.102
But I'm sure there's one other...

21:11.103 --> 21:14.105
Son! Don't forget
that I'm here, too!

21:20.738 --> 21:22.906
Piccolo!

21:25.660 --> 21:27.243
What are you doing here?

21:31.207 --> 21:35.418
It's not as though I came to
help you. I owe these guys one.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.278
Gohan!

22:02.279 --> 22:03.488
Oh, no!

22:33.102 --> 22:34.310
Gohan!

22:37.106 --> 22:38.273
Not so fast!

22:39.150 --> 22:40.734
Kuririn, take care of Gohan!

22:40.735 --> 22:41.860
Y- you got it!

22:58.711 --> 23:00.295
I won't let you!

23:09.513 --> 23:11.514
I'm going to pay you back in full.

23:28.783 --> 23:32.786
Can't you fight me, unless all
three of you take me by surprise?

23:32.787 --> 23:36.998
You must be joking! I'm more than
enough to take care of you myself!

23:42.755 --> 23:44.547
Don't you have any
better power than that?

24:07.822 --> 24:09.614
You're a monster!

24:12.827 --> 24:14.828
You guys are insignificant by yourselves.

24:37.017 --> 24:41.437
After this, I'm going to create
the ideal world of darkness.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.607
You just relax and go to hell.

24:55.494 --> 24:58.037
W- why you...

25:37.912 --> 25:39.329
Extend, Nyoi-bo!

26:02.478 --> 26:04.771
Kamehame...

26:07.316 --> 26:08.691
Ha!!

26:32.341 --> 26:34.926
Nothing is left for old
warriors, but to be wiped out!

26:34.927 --> 26:37.512
Let this be a lesson to you from my father!

26:37.513 --> 26:39.931
And now, I will finish you off!

26:47.022 --> 26:51.734
I am still Kami over the earth. I know
what kind of misery and misfortune

26:51.735 --> 26:55.989
will come to the world
with you reigning over it.

26:55.990 --> 26:59.409
Even if it costs me my life, I will
not allow you to have your way!

27:04.540 --> 27:08.376
You fool. Are you saying
you would kill us both?

27:08.377 --> 27:09.544
That's right.

27:09.545 --> 27:12.880
That may be the one thing
that I am finally capable of.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.386
You may die, but I will not!

27:19.972 --> 27:22.598
You may not die, all right...

27:24.560 --> 27:29.439
...but even if your life goes
on, if you cannot do anything,

27:29.440 --> 27:31.566
it will indeed be hell for you.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.985
I will give you a taste of the pain of hell.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.238
Piccolo!

27:43.245 --> 27:45.246
Kuririn! Take care of Gohan!

27:46.415 --> 27:47.790
Y- you got it!

27:51.420 --> 27:54.589
What a shame, Son Goku, Piccolo.

27:54.590 --> 27:56.632
How could folks such as yourselves

27:56.633 --> 27:59.427
come to the aid of
this withered old Kami!?

28:09.438 --> 28:11.647
I sense an awesome power...

28:32.044 --> 28:33.628
Take this!

28:39.635 --> 28:40.635
Damn...

28:43.055 --> 28:45.056
Kami-sama, watch on from here.

28:45.849 --> 28:48.267
I'm counting on you, Goku!

29:03.534 --> 29:04.909
Piccolo! Make way!

30:06.805 --> 30:07.805
Dammit!

30:30.662 --> 30:33.623
Is that all the two of you together can do?

30:33.624 --> 30:35.750
Damn, he's got outrageous power!

30:35.751 --> 30:37.919
If we don't watch it,
we're going to get done in.

30:46.887 --> 30:49.805
You're taking those off, huh?
He is a dangerous opponent

30:49.806 --> 30:52.642
for someone who cannot
seriously use all of their power.

30:56.605 --> 30:59.190
Piccolo, you're wearing
the heavy stuff, too?

30:59.816 --> 31:03.694
You aren't the only one who's training.

31:03.695 --> 31:06.864
Who would have thought that
we'd be fighting together?

31:06.865 --> 31:11.244
Once we defeat him...
your turn comes next!

32:05.048 --> 32:06.007
Piccolo...

32:09.928 --> 32:12.096
Piccolo, you...

32:13.015 --> 32:14.932
You keep out of it!

32:14.933 --> 32:17.935
Son, now it's our turn to settle things!

32:20.564 --> 32:24.358
Looks like that's all we can do, huh?

32:34.870 --> 32:37.538
I told you! I will not die!

33:21.917 --> 33:23.125
Piccolo!

33:34.888 --> 33:39.558
Where's Goku's child!? Don't tell
me he went through that opening!

33:41.269 --> 33:43.062
Gohan!

33:52.698 --> 33:55.491
Why, you! You think you're so clever!

33:59.621 --> 34:05.000
Let everything be sucked into
this Dead Zone that I have created!

34:05.127 --> 34:07.712
Not a single ray of light can penetrate it!

34:07.713 --> 34:09.505
You will be locked
inside this hell of darkness,

34:09.505 --> 34:12.299
both body and spirit,
until you are dead!

34:16.138 --> 34:17.554
Yow!

34:40.954 --> 34:42.371
Gohan!

34:51.757 --> 34:52.757
What?

35:00.849 --> 35:02.433
Gohan!

35:05.353 --> 35:09.273
That brat! His power is beyond mine!

35:12.319 --> 35:17.448
What kind of power is that!?
He's no ordinary kid, all right!

35:23.914 --> 35:26.916
I'll put forth all of my power!

36:03.161 --> 36:04.578
Gohan!

36:07.541 --> 36:09.166
Goku!

36:09.459 --> 36:11.877
Father!

36:19.177 --> 36:24.723
I will not die! I have obtained eternal life!

37:24.242 --> 37:26.660
K- Kami-sama, what happened to Garlic Jr?

37:26.661 --> 37:31.624
He fell into the very hell
that he himself created.

37:31.625 --> 37:38.255
Garlic must go on living in there forever.

37:38.256 --> 37:42.676
He probably regrets gaining eternal life.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.896
Gohan!

37:54.689 --> 37:59.485
Ah! Father! You really
did come to save me, huh?

38:03.114 --> 38:05.115
Gohan, don't you remember?

38:05.116 --> 38:08.327
My father is the strongest
person in the world, all right.

38:17.712 --> 38:22.299
Gohan, that was a scary experience, huh?
Come on, let's go home to your mother.

38:43.154 --> 38:49.159
Son Goku, someday, I'll
make sure we settle this.

38:50.745 --> 38:56.875
Garlic Jr's grand schemes have come
to an end, like a dream within a dream,

38:56.876 --> 38:59.336
thanks to the power
of Goku and the others.

38:59.337 --> 39:03.382
Goku thought about whether
or not he should tell Chichi

39:03.383 --> 39:08.012
about how he had been
saved by his son, Gohan...

39:12.183 --> 39:14.935
Chichi wouldn't believe it anyhow.

39:15.478 --> 39:18.439
I guess I'll tell Gohan
about it once he grows up.

39:45.800 --> 39:49.803
Here it comes a-fighting,
an apple-colored monster.

39:49.804 --> 39:55.142
Here it comes a-fighting,
a nut-scented alien.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.145
They meet and the heart beats faster.

40:01.399 --> 40:06.904
Sparkle, sparkle, the
galaxy's a popcorn shower!

40:08.823 --> 40:13.243
Yesterday goes bye,
bye, bye (Gohan),

40:13.244 --> 40:17.206
Mystery (far as the eye can see),

40:17.207 --> 40:20.375
Gather up your energy,
(substitutes are okay),

40:20.376 --> 40:23.545
Come over here, lai, lai, lai

40:25.256 --> 40:30.844
Ooh, miracle ZENKAI power!

40:32.847 --> 40:34.848
A hungry, naughty Kinto Un,

40:34.849 --> 40:36.850
A mountainful of horizons,

40:36.851 --> 40:38.852
They meet each other, they come apart,
they meet each other, they come apart,

40:38.853 --> 40:40.854
Oh, no!

40:40.855 --> 40:46.443
Aah, enough!
Even Kami-sama has it rough.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.445
So sorry.

40:48.446 --> 40:54.159
Ooh, full-bellied ZENKAI power!
