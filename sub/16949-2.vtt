00:02.035 --> 00:04.137
{\an8}Previously on "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood"...

00:04.204 --> 00:05.538
{\an7}Are you looking to settle down
right now?

00:05.605 --> 00:07.340
{\an8}We taking baby steps,
remember?

00:07.407 --> 00:09.542
{\an7}As long as you don't live with
no girl, that's okay.

00:09.609 --> 00:11.911
{\an8}I'm not gonna be okay with
a man that I'm talking to

00:11.978 --> 00:13.346
{\an8}living with his baby mama.

00:13.413 --> 00:16.950
{\an7}The only thing I want from him
is a vial of sperm.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.651
{\an7}Why don't you get on
your own two feet?

00:18.718 --> 00:21.521
{\an8}What's the point of me
even telling you
if we not exclusive?

00:21.588 --> 00:24.958
{\an7}Maybe you're used to a bitch
who's is up under you all day.

00:25.024 --> 00:27.660
{\an7}It's a lot of pressure to go
and just say that word

00:27.727 --> 00:28.828
{\an8}to the person you getting
married to.

00:28.895 --> 00:31.865
{\an8}There will be a prenup.

00:33.233 --> 00:38.037
{\an7}I just wanted to know what you
thought about a prenup.

00:38.104 --> 00:39.472
{\an8}I do not want
to sign a prenup.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.475
{\an8}Looks like you have
something to figure out.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.444
{\an8}So, it's some things that
you do need to know

00:44.511 --> 00:46.379
{\an8}about how when Willie
come in Chicago.

00:46.446 --> 00:48.415
{\an7}Okay.

00:46.446 --> 00:48.415
{\an8}How he is contacting me.

00:48.481 --> 00:49.549
{\an8}And we're still (bleep).

00:50.884 --> 00:52.252
{\an8}What have you been doing?

00:52.318 --> 00:54.487
{\an9}Recording.

00:52.318 --> 00:54.487
{\an7}Not today.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.122
{\an8}Outside of your marriage.

00:56.189 --> 00:58.591
{\an9}Nothing.

00:58.658 --> 01:00.860
{\an7}(bleep).

{\an8}What have you been doing?

01:37.397 --> 01:39.766

01:37.397 --> 01:39.766
{\an7}Not today.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.267
{\an8}What have you been doing,

01:41.334 --> 01:44.904
{\an8}outside of your marriage?

01:41.334 --> 01:44.904
{\an9}Nothing.

01:44.971 --> 01:47.540
{\an8}After she gave me the evidence,
it was time for me to hear

01:47.607 --> 01:49.008
{\an8}Willie's dumb-ass side
of the story,

01:49.075 --> 01:51.211
{\an8}because at this point, he got
some explaining to do.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.046
I knew that he was in
the studio also.

01:53.112 --> 01:56.449
{\an5}So, since my work got
interrupted with his
bull (bleep),

01:56.516 --> 01:59.285
I'm gonna bring my ass and
return the favor.

01:59.352 --> 02:00.587
So I asked this bitch
to stick around

02:00.653 --> 02:01.921
until I heard his side
of the story,

02:01.988 --> 02:03.490
and if I needed her,
I'll call her.

02:03.556 --> 02:05.925
See, Kyesha...

02:05.992 --> 02:08.360
{\an5}Kyesha, who, from Chicago?

02:05.992 --> 02:08.360
{\an1}Yes.

02:08.428 --> 02:10.128
She brought this to me, baby.

02:13.333 --> 02:17.637
You were really
(bleep) thirsty.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.873
{\an5}Just be honest, is it true?

02:17.704 --> 02:19.873
{\an3}No.

02:19.939 --> 02:21.174
{\an5}You've never met up with her?

02:19.939 --> 02:21.174
{\an3}Mm-mmm.

02:21.241 --> 02:22.709
{\an5}You don't text her?

02:21.241 --> 02:22.709
{\an3}Mm-mmm.

02:22.775 --> 02:24.310
{\an8}Damn, here I am, ready to step
to Shanda and her producer

02:24.377 --> 02:25.845
{\an8}and tell him what's up,

02:25.912 --> 02:27.814
{\an8}and then Shanda comes to my
studio session with an envelope

02:27.881 --> 02:29.816
{\an8}full of messages saying that
Kyesha's in town.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.985
Kyesha is some chick that I knew
from back in Chicago.

02:32.051 --> 02:33.453
What the (bleep) is she doing
in L.A.?

02:33.520 --> 02:35.121
And why the (bleep)
is she going to my wife

02:35.188 --> 02:36.990
with a folder full of
bull (bleep)?

02:37.056 --> 02:39.058
{\an1}"I leave tonight, gonna be back
on the 11th."

02:39.125 --> 02:41.694
"Yo, yo, where you at?"

02:41.761 --> 02:42.695
{\an1}"Home."

02:42.762 --> 02:44.130
"Come get busy before I leave."

02:44.197 --> 02:45.164
{\an1}Willie.

02:44.197 --> 02:45.164
Who said that?

02:45.231 --> 02:46.766
I don't know, you tell me.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.135
You see the text messages,
you saw your number.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.771
You know the fact that
you texted (bleep).

02:51.838 --> 02:52.939
So be real.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.674
Is that not your number?

02:54.741 --> 02:56.376
Yeah, it's definitely
my number.

02:56.442 --> 02:57.544
That's definitely
my hats, too.

02:57.610 --> 03:00.046
This is definitely your texts.

03:00.113 --> 03:01.447
{\an1}Right?

03:00.113 --> 03:01.447
{\an3}Right, so--

03:01.514 --> 03:03.249
{\an1}So why-- why-- Why you just
can't be real with me?

03:03.316 --> 03:04.817
What you want me to say
about Kyesha?

03:04.884 --> 03:06.286
{\an1}I don't like her, don't give
a (bleep) about her.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.021
{\an1}Ain't never seen her.
So what are we talking about?

03:08.087 --> 03:09.589
{\an1}There should never be a woman
to ever step to me

03:09.656 --> 03:11.190
to tell me about my husband.

03:11.257 --> 03:13.159
{\an1}Okay, well, tell her to come
and talk to you in front of me.

03:13.226 --> 03:14.694
{\an1}I'm gonna call her,
she's gonna come here.

03:14.761 --> 03:16.529
Don't worry, Willie, I'm one
step ahead of you.

03:16.596 --> 03:19.966
I got this ho on hold, but right
now, I wanna hear from you.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.534
{\an5}Why did you send the--

03:20.033 --> 03:21.534
I don't know, man.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.136
I must have been
feeling myself that day.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.771
I'm sorry,
I apologize for that.

03:24.837 --> 03:26.406
{\an4}Oh, so you think that (bleep)
cool?

03:24.837 --> 03:26.406
It's definitely not cool.

03:26.472 --> 03:28.207
{\an1}You stupid mother (bleep).
You're stupid.

03:28.274 --> 03:29.642
{\an1}You're (bleep) stupid,
you (bleep) ass.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.811
{\an1}You-- You allowed that (bleep)
to (bleep) happen.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.112
Tell her to come.

03:33.179 --> 03:34.314
What to happen?

03:34.380 --> 03:35.748
{\an1}You allowed her to be able
to have something

03:35.815 --> 03:37.183
to come and talk to me about.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.851
{\an5}Tell her to come.

03:37.250 --> 03:38.851
Come on, let's go.

03:38.918 --> 03:40.987
{\an1}Gonna settle this (bleep)
right now.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.758
I knew Willie right off the bat
wouldn't admit what he's done.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.293
I know who I'm dealing with.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.062
So let's all get together,

03:49.128 --> 03:51.164
so we can get to the bottom of
this (bleep).

03:55.268 --> 03:56.669
There she is.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.978
So you're looking for
attention, huh?

04:05.044 --> 04:06.312
{\an1}Willie, but you're hitting
my line up at--

04:06.379 --> 04:07.847
{\an8}You really think I give a
(bleep) about you?

04:07.914 --> 04:10.416
{\an8}But you're hitting my line up at
3:00 in the morning, asking me--

04:10.483 --> 04:12.151
{\an9}When?

04:10.483 --> 04:12.151
{\an8}Are you serious?

04:12.218 --> 04:14.287
{\an5}I showed Shanda the--

04:12.218 --> 04:14.287
I don't give a (bleep).

04:14.354 --> 04:16.221
{\an1}Come on, man, with them damn
chitlin loaves, man.

04:16.289 --> 04:17.523
{\an5}Get the (bleep) out of here.

04:16.289 --> 04:17.523
Chitlin loaf?

04:17.589 --> 04:18.858
{\an3}(bleeps)

04:17.589 --> 04:18.858
Let's not get--

04:18.925 --> 04:20.360
{\an5}Don't-- Don't do that.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.360
Let me tell you something.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.728
{\an5}Don't do it, sweetie.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.728
I did (bleep) up.

04:21.793 --> 04:23.162
{\an5}Okay, that's fine.

04:21.793 --> 04:23.162
I (bleep) up
and I love my wife.

04:23.229 --> 04:24.664
{\an5}I don't give a (bleep)
about you.

04:23.229 --> 04:24.664
Don't do that.

04:24.731 --> 04:25.965
You can get
the (bleep) gone.

04:26.032 --> 04:27.300
Have you ever felt like
I gave a (bleep)?

04:27.367 --> 04:28.668
You still telling me
you love me, right?

04:28.735 --> 04:29.736
{\an3}When?

04:28.735 --> 04:29.736
Are you serious?

04:29.802 --> 04:31.771
{\an1}It's in the (bleep)
text messages!

04:31.838 --> 04:33.072
Are you serious?

04:33.139 --> 04:34.307
You got me (bleep) up.

04:34.374 --> 04:36.242
I tell my fans,
"Love you, too, bae."

04:36.309 --> 04:38.011
{\an1}Are you serious?
Willie.

04:38.077 --> 04:39.245
I don't want
to hear (bleep)

04:39.312 --> 04:40.713
'cause you're here
trying to (bleep)--

04:40.780 --> 04:42.582
'Cause that's the reason why I
told you about the pregnancy.

04:42.649 --> 04:45.018
{\an5}What pregnancy?

04:42.649 --> 04:45.018
Are you serious?!

04:45.084 --> 04:46.419
What are you talking about?

04:46.486 --> 04:48.021
{\an1}We been off and on since 2004
all the way up until now.

04:48.087 --> 04:49.589
Kyesha--
Guess what?

04:49.656 --> 04:51.624
Nobody gives a (bleep)
about the past like that.

04:51.691 --> 04:54.227
Actually, there is somebody that
give a (bleep) about the past,

04:54.293 --> 04:55.595
and that's me.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.363
She claims to have been pregnant
by my husband

04:57.430 --> 05:00.900
and carrying on a (bleep)
relationship for over a decade.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.368
Why wouldn't I give a (bleep)
about that?

05:02.435 --> 05:04.837
These are some serious
accusations,

05:04.904 --> 05:07.340
and Willie better start making
sense of it all, right now.

05:07.407 --> 05:08.608
You hit my line up trying to--

05:08.675 --> 05:11.144
I don't give a (bleep)
about you! You suck ass!

05:11.210 --> 05:12.879
What am I talking to you for?

05:12.945 --> 05:14.747
{\an4}Well, why did you meet up
with me, then?

05:12.945 --> 05:14.747
{\an3}Never. Why?

05:14.814 --> 05:15.982
{\an1}Never?

05:16.049 --> 05:17.617
No, (bleep), I'm gonna
tell the truth.

05:17.684 --> 05:19.452
You came out here for some
bum-ass dumb (bleep).

05:19.519 --> 05:20.720
{\an1}Seriously,
tell the (bleep) truth.

05:20.787 --> 05:22.622
{\an8}So Willie's sitting up here
acting like

05:22.689 --> 05:24.157
{\an8}he don't even know
who the hell I am,

05:24.223 --> 05:27.126
{\an8}but every time he comes to
Chicago, he's in my bed.

05:27.193 --> 05:28.661
Willie keep playing this back
and forth game

05:28.728 --> 05:30.063
between me and Shanda.

05:30.129 --> 05:31.364
He tells me that he loves me,

05:31.431 --> 05:33.266
and I'm here to see if that's
really true.

05:33.332 --> 05:34.567
I'm done with
the situation,

05:34.634 --> 05:35.668
and I'll deal with
what I gotta deal with.

05:35.735 --> 05:36.869
{\an1}Okay. Bye.

05:35.735 --> 05:36.869
But you? Come on.

05:36.936 --> 05:37.870
We don't have nothing
to talk about.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.072
{\an1}Okay.

05:37.937 --> 05:39.072
Nothing to talk about.

05:39.138 --> 05:40.640
{\an5}Good luck to you.

05:39.138 --> 05:40.640
Nothing to talk about.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.809
Y'all can deal with that
(bleep), 'cause I'm done.

05:42.875 --> 05:44.977
I have never done anything
to this chick

05:45.044 --> 05:47.480
that she would ever feel that
her presence

05:47.547 --> 05:49.115
is ever wanted here in L.A.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.550
talking to my wife
about anything.

05:50.616 --> 05:51.651
Nothing.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.019
What the (bleep)
I'm finna do?

05:53.086 --> 05:54.320
Leave my wife of ten years and
get with her?

05:54.387 --> 05:56.155
{\an1}Stop playing with yourself.
You know what it was.

05:56.222 --> 05:58.391
{\an1}I know what what is.
Get the (bleep) outta here.

05:58.458 --> 06:01.027
{\an1}That's the reason why you
(bleep) in 2.5 seconds, boo.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.830
Ha!

06:03.896 --> 06:06.532
♪♪

06:06.599 --> 06:08.634
Brandi been on my hair
for a long time

06:08.701 --> 06:10.236
about starting savings
for our son,

06:10.303 --> 06:12.805
and I finally put together a
little situation where I could

06:12.872 --> 06:15.208
{\an8}tuck the money and give it to
her to take for him.

06:15.274 --> 06:17.176
{\an8}I ain't gonna lie. It's the best
feeling in the world

06:17.243 --> 06:18.878
{\an8}when you can bring money home
for the family

06:18.945 --> 06:21.414
{\an8}and you know that everybody's
gonna be okay.

06:21.481 --> 06:22.915
Oh, it's a circle?

06:22.982 --> 06:25.017
{\an3}What's up?

06:22.982 --> 06:25.017
Daddy's home.

06:25.084 --> 06:27.353
{\an5}Show Daddy your picture.

06:25.084 --> 06:27.353
What you doing?

06:27.420 --> 06:28.988
Go show Daddy your picture.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.557
{\an8}How was your day, baby?

06:31.624 --> 06:34.327
Man, it was long.

06:34.393 --> 06:36.729
Baby, what is all that?

06:36.796 --> 06:38.664
{\an1}Well, yeah, you know, I was
thinking about what you said,

06:38.731 --> 06:41.300
{\an1}when you was like, I be going
through money fast

06:41.367 --> 06:43.770
and we spending a lot of cake

06:43.836 --> 06:46.139
and we need to have
a savings for our son,

06:46.205 --> 06:48.407
so I closed this deal for you,

06:48.474 --> 06:50.676
'cause I just did
an EP for 27,000,

06:50.743 --> 06:52.178
so all that money is his.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.446
I ain't gonna take
a dollar out of it.

06:53.513 --> 06:54.981
{\an5}It's your money.

06:53.513 --> 06:54.981
{\an1}Money!

06:55.047 --> 06:56.182
But she gonna
hold it for you.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.452
{\an5}Oh, my God.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.452
Oh, my goodness.

06:59.519 --> 07:00.453
{\an3}Monies!

07:00.520 --> 07:01.754
{\an3}Monies!

07:01.821 --> 07:04.223
And you said
I'm bad with money?

07:04.290 --> 07:05.758
This is Brandus'
it's Brandus'!

07:05.825 --> 07:06.759
Yay!

07:06.826 --> 07:08.294
{\an3}Oh, my God.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.129
{\an8}Is my husband telling me

07:10.196 --> 07:12.999
{\an8}that all my nagging and
complaining

07:13.065 --> 07:15.568
{\an8}actually went somewhere
positive?

07:15.635 --> 07:16.936
{\an8}Pinch me.

07:17.003 --> 07:19.572
{\an1}The last thing I expected was
for you to give me this.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.440
Like, this is so big.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.342
{\an1}Like, he's going to so
appreciate this.

07:23.409 --> 07:26.312
One thing good about Brandi
is she's cheap.

07:26.379 --> 07:29.215
She ain't trying to spend a
dollar, 50 cent or a quarter

07:29.282 --> 07:30.817
if she don't have to.

07:30.883 --> 07:33.419
So I know when I give her the
money, it's gonna be safe.

07:33.486 --> 07:35.288
{\an1}So all $27,000
is for Brandus, right?

07:35.354 --> 07:36.789
{\an1}Every dollar.
I ain't buying a hamburger.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.892
{\an1}I'm going to call my mom
immediately.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.494
You probably should
have called her

07:41.561 --> 07:43.496
before he went and threw it
all over the room like that.

07:43.563 --> 07:44.630
Oh, he's swimming in it.

07:44.697 --> 07:47.099
Yeah!
I want to swim in it, too.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.901
{\an1}Just make sure you take care
of the money, okay?

07:48.968 --> 07:51.537
{\an1}I'm telling you, I'm putting
this in a CD, a new CD.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.639
{\an5}You take it wherever
you want to put it,
you're in charge of it.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.942
I'm just telling you,
I did my part,

07:56.008 --> 07:57.543
I didn't buy nothing crazy.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.879
Lux didn't go blow all
the money on something.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.981

"Thank you, Daddy!"

It's your girl,

08:12.892 --> 08:15.995
Bitches, I am back.

08:16.062 --> 08:18.865
And I'm pregnant as ever.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.035
{\an8}Last summer was crazy.

08:23.102 --> 08:26.873
{\an8}I had a hot single with Fetty
Wap and we made a baby.

08:26.939 --> 08:29.475
{\an8}I always imagined that whenever
I had kids,

08:29.542 --> 08:30.977
{\an8}I would be able to enjoy my
pregnancy

08:31.043 --> 08:32.778
{\an8}with the person that I was in
love with.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.780
{\an8}But from the time I broke the
news to Fetty,

08:34.847 --> 08:35.948
{\an8}he's made this a living hell.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.717
{\an8}And to add insult to injury,

08:37.783 --> 08:39.952
{\an8}now you're publicly
denying our child

08:40.019 --> 08:42.655
{\an8}and talking (bleep) about me?

08:42.722 --> 08:46.092
{\an8}People have the audacity to
question my motives,

08:46.158 --> 08:49.762
{\an8}saying, oh, I'm a gold-digger,
and you had a baby for a check.

08:49.829 --> 08:52.398
{\an8}I'm having my child because
I love her,

08:52.465 --> 08:54.700
{\an8}and I can't wait to meet her.

08:54.767 --> 08:56.469
{\an8}I never wanted to get a lawyer
involved,

08:56.535 --> 08:59.272
{\an8}but he's left me no choice.

08:59.338 --> 09:02.808
{\an7}So what is it that has you here
in this office today?

09:02.875 --> 09:05.378
{\an7}Um, I was in a relationship
with a rapper.

09:05.444 --> 09:07.580
{\an8}His name is Willy,
he goes by Fetty Wap.

09:07.647 --> 09:09.682
And everything was amazing.

09:09.749 --> 09:11.717
It was great, hanging out,
having fun.

09:11.784 --> 09:13.786
And then I got pregnant.

09:13.853 --> 09:16.722
And he was on the road--

09:16.789 --> 09:19.492
{\an1}Are you clear when it was that
your baby was conceived?

09:19.558 --> 09:20.493
{\an3}Oh, yeah.

09:19.558 --> 09:20.493
{\an1}We know--

09:20.559 --> 09:21.961
{\an6}Oh, yeah.

09:20.559 --> 09:21.961
{\an1}Okay.

09:22.028 --> 09:24.163
{\an7}Is there an issue about whether
or not he's the father?

09:24.230 --> 09:26.132
{\an7}I mean, is saying that
he's not the father?

09:26.198 --> 09:29.535
{\an7}Well, there wasn't, and he
decided to go on social media

09:29.602 --> 09:31.771
and pretty much deny
that this is his child

09:31.837 --> 09:33.105
and this is--
this is why I'm here.

09:33.172 --> 09:35.441
A paternity test
has to be done.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.610
I asked him several times,
and he won't,

09:37.677 --> 09:39.545
because he didn't want proof.

09:39.612 --> 09:41.547
{\an1}So, well, that's really an
important part.

09:41.614 --> 09:44.951
{\an1}So, what is your win in terms of
his financial contribution

09:45.017 --> 09:46.786
and what are your
financial needs?

09:46.852 --> 09:49.155
{\an5}He made it clear that
if I went forward
with this pregnancy,

09:49.221 --> 09:50.489
I would be on my own.

09:50.556 --> 09:51.657
I've been taking care
of everything,

09:51.724 --> 09:53.326
like, you know, by myself.

09:53.392 --> 09:56.495
Uh, medical, prenatal,
housing, everything.

09:56.562 --> 09:59.665
{\an1}So, does he have to help with
those prenatal expenses?

09:59.732 --> 10:01.300
Or is that just,
you're on your own?

10:01.367 --> 10:03.069
{\an1}First of all, the first step
in a case like this

10:03.135 --> 10:04.637
is to determine paternity.

10:04.704 --> 10:07.540
{\an1}The next step in this whole
procedure would be for us

10:07.606 --> 10:10.076
{\an1}to figure out
what would be support

10:10.142 --> 10:12.144
{\an1}and what kind of custody
relationship

10:12.211 --> 10:13.980
would you want him
to have with her.

10:14.046 --> 10:15.881
{\an1}That's worth sleeping on
to get really clear

10:15.948 --> 10:17.583
{\an1}about what it is
that you want.

10:17.650 --> 10:21.320
I just want the entire world
for my little girl,

10:21.387 --> 10:23.656
and I just can't imagine her
growing up, saying,

10:23.723 --> 10:26.625
"I can hear Daddy on the radio,
I can see Daddy on TV,

10:26.692 --> 10:28.194
but why doesn't
he want to see me?"

10:28.260 --> 10:30.663
I couldn't live with myself
if I let that happen.

10:30.730 --> 10:33.165
{\an1}So what you need to be thinking
about right now, overnight,

10:33.232 --> 10:35.401
is really whether or not
you want to file papers,

10:35.468 --> 10:36.602
and what that means.

10:36.669 --> 10:39.138
{\an1}Do you want to go through
the court process?

10:39.205 --> 10:40.773
Do I want to? No.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.876
Do I feel like my hand
is being forced? Yes.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.084
{\an8}Coming up...

about this prenup,

10:54.253 --> 10:55.988
{\an8}Ray, not...

10:56.055 --> 10:58.657
{\an7}Do we really need to give some
extra guarantee?

10:58.724 --> 11:01.560
{\an7}I have this prenup in my hand
and I'm...

11:01.627 --> 11:02.561

Never knew about that (bleep).

Like, come on.

I'm really having a hard time
believing

13:20.299 --> 13:21.967
that this relationship
was just texts.

13:22.034 --> 13:23.936
When we met in the parking lot,
all I heard

13:24.003 --> 13:25.704
was a bunch of screaming
back and forth.

13:25.771 --> 13:27.173
So I don't know what
the hell to believe.

13:27.239 --> 13:28.908
I mean, I'm not trying to
break up my family,

13:28.974 --> 13:31.610
but what I do know is that
we cannot start fresh

13:31.677 --> 13:33.245
if I don't know the truth.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.181
So I'm gonna have one last
sit-down

13:35.247 --> 13:37.149
so that I can get some
real answers

13:37.216 --> 13:39.652

I'm gonna do it.

13:49.195 --> 13:50.696
{\an3}Okay.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.531

slap the (bleep) out of you

13:52.598 --> 13:54.366

but right now, I'm not in a
place where I should disagree.

13:58.704 --> 14:00.839
I just hope that Kyesha comes
with the facts this time

14:00.906 --> 14:02.174
and leave all the bull (bleep)
to the side.

14:02.241 --> 14:04.043
I don't wanna
hurt you no more, Shanda.

14:04.109 --> 14:05.110
I promise you, I don't.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.879
I'm gonna do
whatever I gotta do.

14:06.946 --> 14:08.214
(bleep) you.

14:11.650 --> 14:13.652
♪♪

14:19.692 --> 14:21.660
Today is our engagement party,

14:21.727 --> 14:24.396
and all of our friends and
family are here to celebrate.

14:24.463 --> 14:27.800
{\an8}But instead, my mind
is thinking about

14:27.866 --> 14:30.302
{\an8}this whole prenup situation that
Ray threw at me.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.239
If Ray really thinks that this
is gonna be forever,

14:33.305 --> 14:35.841
then why do we have to prepare
for the worst?

14:35.908 --> 14:37.443
You look handsome.

14:37.509 --> 14:38.677
Everybody came through.

14:38.744 --> 14:40.212
{\an1}Yeah.

14:40.279 --> 14:41.680
What's the--
What's the matter?

14:41.747 --> 14:43.549
I mean, I just, you know, I--

14:43.616 --> 14:46.986
{\an4}I'm still thinking about
the conversation we had
the other day.

14:47.052 --> 14:49.321
{\an1}It's hard for me to,
like, be happy.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.357
Just let God do the doing.

14:51.423 --> 14:52.891
God putting our prenup together?

14:52.958 --> 14:54.193
{\an3}Come on.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.828
Sonja isn't just gonna get away
with this.

14:55.894 --> 14:59.298
{\an8}This is my relationship with
Ray, not Sonja's.

14:59.365 --> 15:02.601
{\an8}If a prenuptial agreement is
required to be a Norwood,

15:02.668 --> 15:05.170
well, then, maybe I don't
need to be one.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.406
{\an8}(shouting)

15:05.237 --> 15:07.406
{\an9}Rocky.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.142
{\an7}Brother, I need to steal
Princess for a second.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.711
{\an9}All right.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.813
Sonja.

15:16.382 --> 15:17.583
{\an1}(Brandy)
Are you nervous?

15:17.650 --> 15:19.485
I mean, I'm happy,
but you know,

15:19.551 --> 15:21.654
I do have some stuff
on my mind.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.022
{\an1}What?

15:23.088 --> 15:24.923
He just, like,
randomly asked me

15:24.990 --> 15:28.327
if I want to get a prenup,

15:28.394 --> 15:32.398
and I feel like your mom is
the one who told him to ask.

15:32.464 --> 15:35.167
{\an5}Who told him to ask for
the prenup.
Yeah.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.702
I'm team Princess and Ray,

15:36.769 --> 15:39.471
{\an1}so I think that you guys
should talk about it.

15:39.538 --> 15:41.240
{\an1}I think you should be
completely honest with him

15:41.307 --> 15:42.908
{\an5}about how it makes you feel.

15:41.307 --> 15:42.908
{\an3}Yeah.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.743
Even about my mom, you know.

15:44.810 --> 15:45.944
{\an1}I think you should
tell her, too.

15:46.011 --> 15:47.579
You've seen it get ugly,

15:47.646 --> 15:49.114
{\an1}like, you know, you've been
there at our worst.

15:49.181 --> 15:50.749
{\an1}I know, I was kinda
pulling you over

15:50.816 --> 15:52.284
{\an1}to ask you could I be
a bridesmaid,

15:52.351 --> 15:55.054
{\an1}and I just popped up
on a deep conversation.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.555
What's that?

15:56.622 --> 15:59.024
{\an1}Actually, I would love for you
to be my maid of honor.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.026
Maid of honor?

16:01.093 --> 16:03.028
Are you serious?

16:03.095 --> 16:04.263
{\an1}Princess.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.998
Are you serious?

16:06.065 --> 16:07.433
{\an1}That would mean
everything to me,

16:07.499 --> 16:10.469
{\an1}because I look at you
as a sister, I really do,

16:10.536 --> 16:11.970
and we are here for you.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.707
You are family to us, okay?

16:14.773 --> 16:16.175
And that's just it.

16:16.241 --> 16:17.376
{\an3}Thank you.

16:17.443 --> 16:19.645
{\an1}You the prettier version
of us, dog.

16:21.246 --> 16:23.015
I don't have any siblings,

16:23.082 --> 16:26.018
and I've always seen Brandy as
my sister,

16:26.085 --> 16:28.320
so of course I want her
to be my maid of honor.

16:28.387 --> 16:29.822
She's been there
for Ray and I

16:29.888 --> 16:31.090
through all of our
ups and downs.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.791
Now, her mother,
on the other hand,

16:32.858 --> 16:34.626
that's a whole different
ballgame.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.697
You look so beautiful.

16:38.764 --> 16:40.132
It's you that inspires me.

16:40.199 --> 16:42.534
{\an1}Like, you the only dude I know
that's still married,

16:42.601 --> 16:46.238
{\an1}that hung in there, that know
how to just let it go.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.173
{\an1}So now, I just want to just say,
you know what?

16:48.240 --> 16:49.675
Well, you know, we eloped.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.777
So, wait. Elope means y'all
just went away and did it?

16:51.844 --> 16:52.945
We just went away and did it.

16:53.011 --> 16:54.179
Like, if you just
drive to Vegas,

16:54.246 --> 16:55.381
go to the chapel,
get married.

16:55.447 --> 16:56.882
{\an1}You ain't sign no prenup
or nothing, huh?

16:56.949 --> 16:58.283
No, I didn't sign no prenup.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.286
If you sign a prenup,
it's like you trying to--

17:01.353 --> 17:04.289
you don't really fully
trust them, you know?

17:04.356 --> 17:06.692
{\an1}(bleep).
All right, man.

17:06.759 --> 17:09.328
{\an8}I hear what Max is saying,
but I do trust Princess,

17:09.395 --> 17:10.796
{\an8}you know what I'm saying?

17:10.863 --> 17:12.731
{\an8}And I want her to know that I'm
in it for the long run.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.165
But I'm gonna keep it real.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.701
I don't know what kind of
earthquake

17:15.768 --> 17:19.104
or what number it's gonna be
if I don't listen

17:19.171 --> 17:21.607
to what my mama told me to do,
and that's sign the prenup.

17:21.673 --> 17:23.709
{\an1}Yeah, I'm gonna figure this
(bleep) out, man.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.411
We all excited,
everybody's happy.

17:25.477 --> 17:27.346
B told me she's been
with Princess,

17:27.413 --> 17:29.415
{\an1}planning for the wedding,
doing all this stuff every day.

17:29.481 --> 17:31.650
{\an1}Like, it's good, it got her
out the house, like...

17:31.717 --> 17:34.286
{\an1}Yo, I mean, she--
she going to.

17:34.353 --> 17:36.855
{\an1}Her and Princess ain't started
doing nothing yet.

17:36.922 --> 17:38.724
Yo, that's some bull (bleep).

17:38.791 --> 17:40.225
For the past two weeks,

17:40.292 --> 17:42.461
B been running around with
Princess, supposedly,

17:42.528 --> 17:44.696
and now I'm talking to Ray and
he telling me

17:44.763 --> 17:46.732
they ain't even got no
planning done?

17:46.799 --> 17:49.401
B up to something,
and it's not cool.

17:49.468 --> 17:50.736
Tell lil B to hurry up
and come through, man.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.237
Where she at, man?

17:52.304 --> 17:53.872
I'm gonna find out
what's going on with that.

17:53.939 --> 17:55.908
{\an4}At least so we can
move around, you know
what I'm saying?

17:55.974 --> 17:57.876
Find out what's up
with that, though.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.412
{\an8}Coming up...

18:00.479 --> 18:02.181
{\an8}Let's call a spade a (bleep)
spade.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.584
{\an8}Bitch, I (bleep) your (bleep),
and yes, I (bleep) liked it.

18:05.651 --> 18:08.520
{\an8}If you had to send one message
to Moniece, what would you say?

18:08.587 --> 18:10.122
{\an7}Be ready.

18:10.189 --> 18:11.890
{\an7}'Cause I'm coming for you,
bitch.

18:20.232 --> 18:23.435
{\an8}♪♪

18:23.502 --> 18:25.037
{\an8}I'm so proud of you.

18:25.103 --> 18:27.973
{\an1}But I just wanted to make sure
that, you know,

18:28.040 --> 18:29.575
{\an1}whatever we talked about
the other day--

18:29.641 --> 18:31.443
{\an1}You know the document that we
talked about the other day?

18:31.510 --> 18:33.812
Yeah. Listen, Ma, I talked
to Princess about it,

18:33.879 --> 18:37.182
she wasn't happy,
which is what it is,

18:37.249 --> 18:40.118
but I got it
figured out, okay?

18:40.185 --> 18:41.920
{\an3}I got this.

18:41.987 --> 18:44.756
{\an8}With all of the turmoil that
Princess and Ray have done

18:44.823 --> 18:46.225
{\an8}and experienced in their
relationship,

18:46.291 --> 18:48.093
{\an8}it is a given.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.394
It is a necessity,

18:49.461 --> 18:51.463
it is a non-negotiable item

18:51.530 --> 18:53.332
that they need
to have a prenup.

18:53.398 --> 18:54.833
For real, for real.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.773
I just want to make a toast to,
uh, Ray and Princess.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.141
{\an1}Thank you.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.710
{\an5}Love is like a deck of cards.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.710
A deck of cards!

19:04.776 --> 19:06.612
You start off with
two hearts and a diamond,

19:06.678 --> 19:08.313
and you just end up wanting to
go to the club

19:08.380 --> 19:09.681
with an ace of spades.

19:09.748 --> 19:11.617
{\an1}Oh!
Talk to 'em, Max Lux.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.355
I'm gonna be serious.

19:16.421 --> 19:18.323
{\an5}It's the last one.

19:16.421 --> 19:18.323
Lux, man...

19:18.390 --> 19:20.425
I thought this one up
from the heart.

19:20.492 --> 19:23.695
To Princess and Ray, through the
thick and the thin,

19:23.762 --> 19:26.698
for the rest of your lives,
I wish y'all the best.

19:26.765 --> 19:28.000
Congratulations.

19:28.066 --> 19:30.836
Max Lux, thank you, man.
Thank you to everybody.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.838
{\an1}I want to thank everybody
for coming out,

19:32.905 --> 19:34.706
{\an1}all of our close friends
and family.

19:34.773 --> 19:37.276
{\an7}I'm just happy to be here
with Princess.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.479
I never felt like this with any
other person I ever been with.

19:40.546 --> 19:42.014
We know.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.583
And you know, and for that

19:44.650 --> 19:46.585
{\an1}I been just thinking
and thinking,

19:46.652 --> 19:49.821
{\an1}and you know, it was this thing
that we was talking about,

19:49.888 --> 19:51.023
{\an1}this prenup or whatever,
you know?

19:51.089 --> 19:53.225
Ray, not...

19:53.292 --> 19:54.893
And listen, it's real,

19:54.960 --> 19:56.628
{\an1}because I was just kind of
figuring it out,

19:56.695 --> 19:58.497
{\an1}like, is that really
what it is?

19:58.564 --> 20:02.234
{\an1}I mean, do you really need to
give some extra guarantee

20:02.301 --> 20:03.635
so we good, no matter what?

20:03.702 --> 20:06.004
{\an1}That's not what love is about.
If I say I want to--

20:06.071 --> 20:07.306
If I wanna marry you
and I want to spend

20:07.372 --> 20:09.141
{\an1}the rest of my life with you,
that's it.

20:09.207 --> 20:10.842
{\an1}So I was--

20:10.909 --> 20:12.578
{\an1}I had this prenup
in my hand and I'm--

20:12.644 --> 20:13.912
I'm gonna just rip
the whole thing up.

20:13.979 --> 20:15.113
Yes!

20:15.180 --> 20:16.615
I'm ripping the thing up.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.116
{\an1}You know?

20:18.183 --> 20:20.953
He has to be out of his fricki''
mind. Is he for real?

20:21.019 --> 20:23.555
He may think that he doesn't
need a prenup,

20:23.622 --> 20:24.890
he may have torn up the paper,

20:24.957 --> 20:26.925
but trust, there's gonna
come a day

20:26.992 --> 20:28.460
that we're gonna sit down

20:28.527 --> 20:30.162
and we're gonna have a serious
conversation about this.

20:30.228 --> 20:32.864
This is not even halfway over.

20:32.931 --> 20:35.267
Love wins.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.811
{\an8}Hello!

20:43.875 --> 20:45.811
{\an8}Come on up.

20:45.877 --> 20:48.113
{\an1}I'm stuck on the couch.
I can't move.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.550
Talking to the lawyers gave me a
whole lot to think about,

20:51.617 --> 20:53.452
{\an8}and I still don't know what I'm
gonna do yet,

20:53.518 --> 20:54.886
{\an8}but it's too much stress.

20:54.953 --> 20:56.755
{\an8}I want to take my mind off of
everything,

20:56.822 --> 20:58.357
so I invited my girls,
Nia and Moniece,

20:58.423 --> 21:01.126
over for some refreshments
and some tea,

21:01.193 --> 21:02.894
and I do mean the tea that's in
the streets.

21:02.961 --> 21:04.830
{\an3}(sniffing)

21:04.896 --> 21:07.265
{\an8}My allergies about to be,
like, woo!

21:07.332 --> 21:08.634
Are you allergic to dogs?

21:08.700 --> 21:10.402
{\an1}No, not normally.
I think it's just the hair.

21:10.469 --> 21:12.471
{\an4}Yeah, you can't be,
'cause I seen some of
the dudes you be around.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.206
(laughing)

21:16.074 --> 21:17.843
My partner in petty crime!

21:17.909 --> 21:19.878
Still hitting the one-liners!

21:21.146 --> 21:22.648
Shut up.

21:22.714 --> 21:24.416
You see, I'm far away,

21:24.483 --> 21:27.052
{\an1}so I say (bleep) 'cause I know
she can't get to me.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.221
{\an1}That was cute, that was good,
that was all right.

21:29.287 --> 21:30.856
{\an1}We all up in there, we all in
that, we all in that.

21:30.922 --> 21:32.524

doggy dogs.

21:32.591 --> 21:34.359
{\an1}Woof!

21:34.426 --> 21:35.694
Have you talked to him
about, like,

21:35.761 --> 21:37.329
what he wants to do,
like, his role?

21:37.396 --> 21:39.931
{\an1}I mean, clearly, he's the dad,
but what is he gonna do?

21:39.998 --> 21:41.233
Is he gonna be out here
all the time?

21:41.299 --> 21:43.168
{\an1}That's his responsibility
to make that happen.

21:43.235 --> 21:47.339
{\an1}I'm not packing up and taking
trips to Jersey, so...

21:47.406 --> 21:48.640

21:47.406 --> 21:48.640
{\an1}No.

with respect,

21:53.478 --> 21:54.680
{\an1}whatever.

21:54.746 --> 21:57.082
It's a whole lot to even
try to think about,

21:57.149 --> 21:59.084
co-parenting with somebody

21:59.151 --> 22:00.719
that I can't even have
a conversation with.

22:00.786 --> 22:03.789
{\an1}So I think that's enough about
me and Mr. Whopper.

22:03.855 --> 22:07.125
I saw a little 15-second clip.

22:07.192 --> 22:08.994
{\an3}Of what?

22:07.192 --> 22:08.994
{\an1}Momo.

22:10.595 --> 22:11.930
What'd you do now?

22:11.997 --> 22:12.964
{\an1}I saw a 15-second of his
on the--

22:13.031 --> 22:14.166
You didn't see it?

22:13.031 --> 22:14.166
{\an3}No.

22:14.232 --> 22:15.801
Just scrolling
on my timeline.

22:15.867 --> 22:17.402
Miss Thing does an interview,

22:17.469 --> 22:22.040
{\an1}and all I hear is, Ray J
only got with Princess

22:22.107 --> 22:24.276
{\an1}because he wanted
to prove to (bleep)

22:24.342 --> 22:25.877
that he could get what he got

22:25.944 --> 22:27.646
{\an1}and he picked
the bottom of the barrel,

22:27.713 --> 22:29.848
{\an1}and then the caption
underneath it was, like,

22:29.915 --> 22:32.551
"Ray J hit it first."

22:32.617 --> 22:34.319
My issue with Princess started
in New York

22:34.386 --> 22:36.855
at Yandy and Mendeecees'
wedding.

22:36.922 --> 22:39.124
I addressed Ray as Raymond

22:39.191 --> 22:41.727
as I have always done
since I was 16.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.628
She was drunk, she felt some
type of way, she was, like,

22:43.695 --> 22:45.464
"His name is not Raymond."

22:45.530 --> 22:47.766
And I'm like, I know, but I've
always called him that,

22:47.833 --> 22:49.401
and she was like, well, that's
not his (bleep) name.

22:49.468 --> 22:51.103
So I spilled all
the (bleep) tea,

22:51.169 --> 22:52.337
which is, I'm sick of
this bitch.

22:52.404 --> 22:54.072
(bleep) her, (bleep) her
(bleep).

22:54.139 --> 22:55.574
We're not friends,
we're not fam,

22:55.640 --> 22:57.476
we're not people,
we're not (bleep).

22:57.542 --> 22:58.610
So Princess doesn't
like the fact

22:58.677 --> 23:00.178
that I'm familiar with her man,

23:00.245 --> 23:02.814
maybe just as familiar as she is
and maybe even a little more.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.082
I don't (bleep) know,

23:04.149 --> 23:05.250
but she should just
get the (bleep) over it

23:05.317 --> 23:06.785
and move right the (bleep)
along.

23:06.852 --> 23:10.822
Don't be mad now, that I'm
familiar with your man.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.190
Wait, does she not know?

23:12.257 --> 23:13.191
You knew he hit it
ten years ago.

23:13.258 --> 23:14.426
She knows.

23:14.493 --> 23:15.694
Let's call a spade a (bleep)
spade.

23:15.761 --> 23:17.095
Bitch, I (bleep) your (bleep),

23:17.162 --> 23:18.697
{\an8}and yes, I (bleep) liked it.

23:18.764 --> 23:21.032
{\an8}You don't have enough
guts or balls

23:21.099 --> 23:23.502
{\an8}to just say what it is you have
to say to my face.

23:23.568 --> 23:25.303
{\an8}You think I'm a (bleep) mother?
Say that.

23:25.370 --> 23:27.072
And then keep it pushing.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.007
You think I'm a ho 'cause I
(bleep) your (bleep)?

23:29.074 --> 23:30.542
Then say that.

23:30.609 --> 23:32.344
I think you're a ho, but that's
none of my business.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.679
Your (bleep), your life,
your consequences.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.482
So you can go spread it,
pop it,

23:37.549 --> 23:38.750
wherever the (bleep) you want,
bitch,

23:38.817 --> 23:40.285
whatever (bleep) you (bleep)

23:40.352 --> 23:41.753
doesn't make me (bleep) or
(bleep), so...

23:41.820 --> 23:43.221
{\an3}Oh, God.

23:43.288 --> 23:45.290
Princess and Moniece
are both my girls,

23:45.357 --> 23:47.759
so I have no intentions on
getting in the middle of this.

23:47.826 --> 23:49.761
I tried that with
Moniece and Brandi,

23:49.828 --> 23:51.129
and we saw how that went.

23:51.196 --> 23:53.398
This time, Moniece might be
on her own.

23:53.465 --> 23:55.801
So, good riddance.

23:55.867 --> 23:58.136
{\an5}That was a mouthful.

23:55.867 --> 23:58.136
It really was.

24:02.073 --> 24:04.342
♪♪

24:07.913 --> 24:09.815
Now, I normally don't do
interviews,

24:09.881 --> 24:12.684
but since I've already been
doing press on the wedding,

24:12.751 --> 24:15.520
{\an8}I decided to do a piece for
Hollywood Unlocked.

24:15.587 --> 24:18.290
{\an3}Jason.

24:15.587 --> 24:18.290
Hey, Princess.

24:18.356 --> 24:20.859
I was finally able to get
Princess in for an interview.

24:20.926 --> 24:23.595
{\an8}She thinks she's coming in to
talk about her wedding to Ray,

24:23.662 --> 24:25.263
{\an8}but what I really need to talk
to her about

24:25.330 --> 24:27.098
{\an8}is how Moniece is running all
around town

24:27.165 --> 24:28.500
{\an8}talking about how she (bleep)
her man.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.001
{\an8}You know I gotta get
the exclusive.

24:30.068 --> 24:33.004
{\an1}Princess, thank you so much
for sitting down with us.

24:33.071 --> 24:35.173
I know that you don't do
interviews with people.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.641
{\an1}Mm-mm.

24:35.240 --> 24:36.641
{\an3}Um...

24:36.708 --> 24:39.211
{\an1}And so I appreciate you
trusting Hollywood Unlocked

24:39.277 --> 24:41.313
to tell your side of
the story, so thank you.

24:41.379 --> 24:42.848
Thank you for having me.

24:42.914 --> 24:44.749
Getting ready to talk
with you today--

24:44.816 --> 24:46.318
Clearly, we had to see--

24:46.384 --> 24:48.553
{\an1}You know, what's going on in
the world of Princess and Ray J?

24:48.620 --> 24:52.557
And then I ran across this
interview with Moniece.

24:52.624 --> 24:55.827
One of the things that she
said in the interview was,

24:55.894 --> 24:57.429
she hit it first.

24:57.495 --> 24:59.831
You invite me here to do a piece
on my wedding

24:59.898 --> 25:02.634
and then you hit me with this
Moniece bull (bleep)?

25:02.701 --> 25:04.936
Now, I should have
known better.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.372
Jason is one of the messiest
people in Hollywood.

25:07.439 --> 25:09.641
But (bleep) it.
You wanna take it there?

25:09.708 --> 25:10.842
I'll take it there.

25:10.909 --> 25:12.644
Let's talk about this bitch
Moniece.

25:12.711 --> 25:14.579
I asked Ray about it and I'm
like, look, just, you know,

25:14.646 --> 25:17.515
tell me what's up, because I
don't want to be blindsided.

25:17.582 --> 25:20.285
{\an1}He's like, I (bleep) that girl
one time at a party,

25:20.352 --> 25:21.620
do you know what I mean?

25:21.686 --> 25:22.988
{\an1}Like, bitch, you're just the
(bleep) that got (bleep)

25:23.054 --> 25:24.789
at a party when you were 19

25:24.856 --> 25:26.658
{\an1}and five of his homeys (bleep)
you since then.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.026
These are her words.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.728
"And really,
I think her issue

25:29.794 --> 25:32.831
{\an1}"is that my introduction to the
(bleep) was through family.

25:32.898 --> 25:34.599
"Her, she had to (bleep)
and (bleep)

25:34.666 --> 25:36.101
"through an entire
team of (bleep)

25:36.167 --> 25:38.603
and she just so happened
to get saved by one."

25:38.670 --> 25:40.305
Your introduction to what?

25:40.372 --> 25:42.841
Getting (bleep) at a party?

25:42.908 --> 25:45.677
{\an1}First of all,
he didn't even (bleep).

25:45.744 --> 25:48.380
{\an1}He stopped (bleep) you 'cause he
said you were disgusting.

25:48.446 --> 25:50.548
That was when he was, like,
in his crazy days, you know?

25:50.615 --> 25:51.816
{\an1}He was 19.

25:50.615 --> 25:51.816
Mm-hmm, yeah.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.686
Yes, Moniece, you got (bleep)
by Ray J.

25:54.753 --> 25:56.187
Who the (bleep) cares?

25:56.254 --> 25:57.322
You want a (bleep) cookie?

25:57.389 --> 25:59.190
The bitch is not relevant.

25:59.257 --> 26:01.426
Ray doesn't even remember when
it happened.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.929
Or maybe he's trying to make
himself forget. I would, too.

26:03.995 --> 26:06.932
I'm sick and tired of her having
me and Ray's name in her mouth.

26:06.998 --> 26:08.466
She needs to go somewhere

26:08.533 --> 26:11.202
before I slap them big-ass,
tired-ass bags off her eyes

26:11.269 --> 26:13.438
and smack that smirk
off her face.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.507
So, if you had to
send a message,

26:15.573 --> 26:17.242
one message to Moniece,
what would you say?

26:17.309 --> 26:19.010
{\an1}Be ready.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.546
{\an1}'Cause I'm coming for you,
bitch.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.550
{\an8}Coming up...

26:25.617 --> 26:27.485
{\an7}She just said in an interview
she's gonna get you.

26:27.552 --> 26:29.354
{\an8}What I really want to do
is bust that bitch

26:29.421 --> 26:32.090
{\an8}upside her head
and just keep it pushing.

26:32.157 --> 26:33.291
{\an8}So he denied everything.

26:33.358 --> 26:34.859
{\an8}He didn't deny the texts,

26:34.926 --> 26:36.428
{\an7}'cause that'd be a dumbass
(bleep) to deny.

26:36.494 --> 26:37.862
{\an8}You know your man,
you gonna figure it out,

26:37.929 --> 26:40.131
{\an8}but what if she's
telling the truth?

26:46.538 --> 26:48.540
♪♪

26:51.509 --> 26:55.213
I done been through so much
(bleep) in the past week.

26:55.280 --> 26:56.414
What are you doing here?

26:56.481 --> 26:58.316
All I need is my girls,
some drink

26:58.383 --> 26:59.985
{\an8}and a couple of laughs,

27:00.051 --> 27:01.619

Well, guess what, though?
Willie, though?

27:38.757 --> 27:41.326
{\an1}He's definitely in
the mother (bleep) doghouse.

through some (bleep),

that he had a--

27:49.334 --> 27:51.336
{\an1}He had a lot to do with letting
that bitch into my home.

{\an8}I have, honestly,
I always thought

27:53.338 --> 27:56.007
{\an8}Shanda and Willie had the
perfect marriage.

27:56.074 --> 27:57.642
{\an8}If that was Max,

27:57.709 --> 27:59.744
{\an8}his ass would be
in the doghouse

27:59.811 --> 28:03.348
for a long-ass
mother (bleep) time.

28:03.415 --> 28:05.316
{\an1}At this point, I'm like,
(bleep).

28:05.383 --> 28:07.786
Tell me everything right now,
'cause we can handle it now.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.220
Now!
Even if it's the worst!

28:09.287 --> 28:11.222
{\an1}We've already had that
conversation.

{\an1}But this mother (bleep)
swear to God

28:12.957 --> 28:15.093
{\an1}that he hasn't seen
this bitch since 2004.

28:15.160 --> 28:16.928
So he denied everything.

28:16.995 --> 28:18.496
{\an1}He didn't--
No, he didn't deny the texts,

28:18.563 --> 28:19.764
{\an1}'cause that would be
a dumbass (bleep)

28:19.831 --> 28:21.332
{\an1}to deny some (bleep)
like that,

28:21.399 --> 28:23.134
{\an1}because it's right here, like,
you know what I'm saying?

28:23.201 --> 28:25.270
How we gonna figure out
who's telling the truth?

28:25.336 --> 28:27.072
{\an1}I was like, let's sit
in front of this bitch,

28:27.138 --> 28:29.240
{\an1}so let me see her say that
(bleep) is, like--

28:29.307 --> 28:30.475
{\an3}Right.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.876
You don't know her,
but you know him,

28:31.943 --> 28:33.078
so you gonna know
if he's flexing

28:33.144 --> 28:34.546
or if he's really,
like, okay.

28:34.612 --> 28:36.147
You figure it out.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.016
{\an1}I know him, I know him enough to
know when he's a (bleep) liar.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.717
So just watch his moves
and you'll know.

28:39.784 --> 28:42.053
Even though I still believe that
this Latina-ass bitch

28:42.120 --> 28:43.655
is some groupie from
Willie's past,

28:43.721 --> 28:45.590
this (bleep) is just real
crazy right now.

28:45.657 --> 28:47.058
Nikki's right.

28:47.125 --> 28:48.326
When the three of us sit down,

28:48.393 --> 28:49.928
I'm gonna need to keep
an eye on Willie,

28:49.994 --> 28:51.896
because this (bleep)
just don't add up.

28:51.963 --> 28:54.299
You know your man,
you gonna figure it out.

28:54.365 --> 28:55.733
But what if she's
telling the truth?

about (bleep).

36:41.299 --> 36:44.068
My question to you...

36:41.299 --> 36:44.068
{\an3}Okay.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.102
{\an1}Since there was a baby,
what happened?

36:45.169 --> 36:46.370
Where is this baby?

36:45.169 --> 36:46.370
{\an3}Okay.

36:46.437 --> 36:47.772
The reason why
I lost the baby,

36:47.838 --> 36:49.373
because you was pregnant
at the same time.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.841
{\an1}Why would you lose the baby?
I don't understand.

36:50.908 --> 36:53.244
{\an1}Because I was so stressed out
because he was lying.

36:53.311 --> 36:56.380
{\an4}The things I lied about,
I already talked to my wife
about, now you come on--

36:56.447 --> 36:58.783
Why are you lying, Lucky?
Why are you lying?

36:58.849 --> 37:00.985
{\an1}Look, don't call me Lucky.
That (bleep) was dead years ago.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.386
{\an6}Why not?

37:01.052 --> 37:02.386
Don't call me (bleep).

37:02.453 --> 37:03.988
{\an1}That's in the text messages,
too, because I still--

37:04.055 --> 37:05.523
I don't give a (bleep).
I don't give a (bleep).

37:05.590 --> 37:07.625
{\an1}Yo, that's cool, I told her,
text messages.

37:07.692 --> 37:08.926
Look, I'm not changing
my story.

37:08.993 --> 37:10.628
{\an8}I ain't seen Kyesha in over
ten years.

37:10.695 --> 37:12.029
{\an8}(bleep) crazy.

37:12.096 --> 37:13.264
{\an8}She came out here to drop
all this bull (bleep)

37:13.331 --> 37:14.899
on my wife, for what?

37:14.966 --> 37:16.867
I did send her some (bleep) up
ass text messages, I did,

37:16.934 --> 37:18.302
and I'm wrong for that (bleep).

37:18.369 --> 37:20.171
But all this (bleep) she
bringing in my life right now,

37:20.237 --> 37:22.773
{\an5}man, this mother (bleep)
chick should haul her ass
right back to Chicago.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.675
Why are you here?
Why are you here?

37:24.742 --> 37:26.110
You came here for what?

37:26.177 --> 37:28.613
What I'm here for, because
Willie is a liar.

37:28.679 --> 37:31.716
Yes, we did meet up
on December 12th of 2015

37:31.782 --> 37:33.718
at the Red Roof Inn Hotel.

37:33.784 --> 37:34.919
Okay.

37:33.784 --> 37:34.919
Yes, we did.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.621
{\an5}Were we in Chicago then?

37:34.986 --> 37:36.621
And we did have sex.

37:36.687 --> 37:38.723
Yes-- No, Shanda was in L.A.

37:38.789 --> 37:40.625
{\an5}And not only that--

37:38.789 --> 37:40.625
How do you know where I was?

37:40.691 --> 37:42.393
{\an5}Because he told me.

37:40.691 --> 37:42.393
You a (bleep) liar.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.128
{\an1}Did--
Did you come--

37:44.195 --> 37:45.963
And guess what?
It's more to come.

37:46.030 --> 37:47.665
{\an5}You saw me and--

37:46.030 --> 37:47.665
It ain't just me, Shanda.

37:47.732 --> 37:48.933
{\an1}I don't give a (bleep)
about that!

37:49.000 --> 37:50.568
{\an1}Worry about you, bitch,
worry about you!

37:50.635 --> 37:52.103
Bitch?

37:50.635 --> 37:52.103
Bitch.

37:52.169 --> 37:53.638
{\an1}I love her and I don't give
a (bleep) about you!

37:53.704 --> 37:54.639
You not a side mother (bleep)--

37:54.705 --> 37:57.074
You know how
you (bleep) back

37:57.141 --> 38:00.011
{\an1}and you know how I (bleep) made
your ass (bleep) like that!

38:00.077 --> 38:01.278
Why are you here?

38:01.345 --> 38:03.581
I was still in love with you!

38:08.586 --> 38:09.987
Guess what?
I still (bleep) him!

38:10.054 --> 38:10.988
You will (bleep) who?

38:11.055 --> 38:13.257
I still (bleep)
your (bleep) ass

38:13.324 --> 38:15.993
and make your ass (bleep)
within two seconds again!

38:16.060 --> 38:18.696
{\an1}Just take this ho out of here.
I ain't got time for it.

38:18.763 --> 38:19.897
Ho! Ho!

38:19.964 --> 38:21.098
Stand right here
and call me a ho.

38:21.165 --> 38:22.566
{\an5}Stand right here
and call me a ho.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.468
{\an1}Get your goofy ass
up out of here.

38:24.535 --> 38:26.137
Goofy?
I'll show your ass goofy!

38:26.203 --> 38:27.571
Try me, try me.

38:27.638 --> 38:29.440
Try me, try me.

38:29.507 --> 38:30.908
(bleep)!

38:30.975 --> 38:32.677
Yes, I am still
in love with his ass!

38:32.743 --> 38:33.978
For more than 12 years,

38:34.045 --> 38:35.746
Willie been telling me
that he loves me.

38:35.813 --> 38:38.015
If this dumb bitch think
I'm about to fall back,

38:38.082 --> 38:39.216
she dead wrong.

38:39.283 --> 38:41.118
I came to L.A. to get
the truth out.

38:41.185 --> 38:44.088
Trust and believe, I'm not
leaving until I get it out.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.523
{\an4}Let's go.
Let's go.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.523
I know, y'all!

38:45.589 --> 38:47.258
Can we stop now?

38:47.324 --> 38:49.326
You're so (bleep) stupid.

38:51.495 --> 38:53.230
I'm not proud of the fact
that I went for her,

38:53.297 --> 38:55.900
but when that bitch said,
"Oh, Willie, I still love you,"

38:55.966 --> 38:57.902
I just went with my first
reaction.

38:57.968 --> 38:59.370
The truth of the matter is,

38:59.437 --> 39:00.705
I've heard enough
from these two.

39:00.771 --> 39:02.540
They're both liars in my book.

39:02.606 --> 39:04.241
At this point,
I don't give no (bleep).

39:04.308 --> 39:05.509
Zero.

39:05.576 --> 39:07.378
{\an1}What I did, I did.
I'm not trying to justify it.

39:07.445 --> 39:08.612
{\an1}I wanted the truth
to come out.

39:08.679 --> 39:09.914
(bleep) the bull (bleep).

39:09.980 --> 39:11.415
The truth is...

39:09.980 --> 39:11.415
The truth--

39:11.482 --> 39:12.850
Both of you mother (bleep)
are lying.

39:12.917 --> 39:14.952
I can't (bleep) talk
to no liar at this point.

39:20.257 --> 39:23.094
{\an8}Next time on "Love &amp; Hip-Hop:
Hollywood"...

39:23.160 --> 39:25.529
{\an7}Moniece did an interview
about me and you.

39:25.596 --> 39:27.665
{\an7}She was talking about us,
our family.

39:27.732 --> 39:30.101
{\an8}I told you, I smashed her
for half a second.

39:30.167 --> 39:32.036
{\an8}You don't have no concern
for nobody.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.804
{\an7}You want to tell the whole world
who you been (bleep)

39:33.871 --> 39:35.239
{\an8}so our son can go
on the Internet

39:35.306 --> 39:36.373
{\an8}when he gets older
and see that (bleep).

39:36.440 --> 39:37.908
{\an8}You a loose cannon.

39:37.975 --> 39:40.077
{\an8}You like to sit here and attack
people from behind your computer

39:40.144 --> 39:41.645
{\an7}like you're some type
of (bleep) thug?

39:41.712 --> 39:43.247
{\an8}My issue with you began

39:43.314 --> 39:46.083
{\an8}when you said what
you said about my son.

39:46.150 --> 39:47.284
{\an8}(bleep) you.

39:47.351 --> 39:48.452
{\an7}Well, then the conversation
is over.

39:48.519 --> 39:50.087
{\an7}Don't think that it's over,
bitch.

39:51.555 --> 39:55.159
{\an7}I had a couple execs text me,
like, who else is singing?

39:55.226 --> 39:56.727
{\an8}They thought it was
a background singer.

39:56.794 --> 39:59.063
{\an8}If you refer to me as
a backup singer again,

39:59.130 --> 40:01.999
{\an8}man, you gonna have
a problem that's not gonna
go away anytime soon.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.602
{\an8}You make it sound like
my mom is the devil

40:04.668 --> 40:05.770
{\an8}and your mom's an angel.

40:04.668 --> 40:05.770
{\an7}No.

40:05.836 --> 40:07.238
{\an8}Let's be real here.

40:07.304 --> 40:09.840
{\an7}Your mom is hard to deal with,
living under our roof.

40:09.907 --> 40:12.143
{\an7}Everybody can see you think you
think you Miss Diva, anyway.

40:12.209 --> 40:13.544
{\an8}You wannabe stars.

40:12.209 --> 40:13.544
{\an7}Diva?

40:13.611 --> 40:14.879
{\an7}I just live my life.
We wannabe stars?

40:13.611 --> 40:14.879
{\an9}Yes.

40:14.945 --> 40:16.781
{\an8}Da-da-da-da-da.

40:16.847 --> 40:19.250
{\an8}Sound like a horse.

40:19.316 --> 40:20.751
{\an7}How did you put all this
together?

40:20.818 --> 40:22.386
{\an8}I had been on Max

40:22.453 --> 40:25.356
{\an8}that we need to put away
$27,000 for the baby.

40:25.422 --> 40:26.857
{\an8}You did not spend that money.

40:26.924 --> 40:29.960
{\an8}I didn't put a dollar into
Brandus' savings.

40:30.027 --> 40:32.296
{\an7}You know Lil Brandi ain't doing
nothing crazy foul.

40:32.363 --> 40:36.100
{\an8}But some of the (bleep) that
you asking me is inaccurate.

40:36.167 --> 40:37.902
{\an7}Now she making me want to
investigate.

40:37.968 --> 40:40.771
{\an8}I told Ray.

40:37.968 --> 40:40.771
{\an9}You what?

40:40.838 --> 40:42.740
{\an8}It's only a matter of time
before this (bleep)

40:42.807 --> 40:45.676
{\an8}all blows up
in my (bleep) face.

40:45.743 --> 40:47.444
{\an8}And where you get the money?

40:47.511 --> 40:49.346
{\an8}The 27,000 that you had...

40:49.413 --> 40:51.015
{\an7}I know you not talking about
my son's money.

40:51.081 --> 40:53.184
{\an7}No!

40:51.081 --> 40:53.184
{\an8}Don't do that.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.019
{\an8}Get off my
mother (bleep) car.

40:55.085 --> 40:56.353
{\an8}You're not going to leave me.

40:56.420 --> 40:57.755
{\an7}No!

40:56.420 --> 40:57.755
{\an8}(car accelerating)
