WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:02.329
- Previously on Haven...

00:02.461 --> 00:04.998
- Still haven't figured out
how to bring down that fog wall yet.

00:05.131 --> 00:07.372
- Maybe that's a blessing.
Keep this chaos contained to Haven.

00:07.508 --> 00:09.749
It's not what hides in the dark
we need to worry about.

00:09.886 --> 00:11.467
- It's the dark itself.
- You'll die if you...

00:11.596 --> 00:12.585
(screams)

00:12.722 --> 00:14.303
- Go into the dark.
- Hailie!

00:14.432 --> 00:16.388
- When I was 12,
I heard you and my dad

00:16.517 --> 00:18.724
talking about using my mom's
special powers to get stuff.

00:19.145 --> 00:21.431
(grunts)
(screams)

00:21.564 --> 00:24.226
- The car went through me.
- I did it to save your life.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.189
Let's just hope it doesn't end it.

00:26.319 --> 00:28.355
- What am I looking at?
- Rolf Starr.

00:28.487 --> 00:31.854
My missing person
you're supposed to be tracking down?

00:31.991 --> 00:34.152
- What the hell's going on
with your eyes, man?

00:34.285 --> 00:36.321
- Three other deaths
in the last two weeks.

00:36.454 --> 00:39.116
The no marks killer.
- I've been getting a blip.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.284
- You need help?

00:41.417 --> 00:43.749
- There's aether down there.
- Now what?

00:43.878 --> 00:44.867
- We follow.

00:45.004 --> 00:45.959
- Where's Kira?

00:46.088 --> 00:49.580
- We got stuck in the dark. Kira's dead.
- You bastard!

00:49.717 --> 00:50.877
This is your fault.

00:51.010 --> 00:52.125
You killed her!

00:53.304 --> 00:56.046
(crowd yelling)

00:58.684 --> 01:00.345
- Calm down!

01:00.478 --> 01:01.718
Everybody, just calm down.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.515
Let's not get riled up.

01:03.648 --> 01:05.263
It sets off Troubles.

01:06.901 --> 01:10.109
- I can't believe she's gone.

01:10.238 --> 01:11.398
- What's going on?

01:11.530 --> 01:13.612
- Nathan got Kira killed.

01:13.741 --> 01:14.856
- What happened?

01:14.992 --> 01:18.405
- I need to talk to you in private.
- Is she alive or isn't she?

01:21.874 --> 01:24.616
- She's dead.
(crowd murmurs)

01:25.503 --> 01:28.461
I'm sorry.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.544
- Are you okay?

01:29.674 --> 01:31.585
- I'm fine.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.332
- Nathan left the power plant with Kira.

01:33.469 --> 01:35.460
Won't say where they went.

01:37.723 --> 01:41.511
- Who here lost someone last night
because the power was out?

01:41.644 --> 01:43.635
-|have.

01:43.771 --> 01:47.764
- And if the plant fails again,
how many more are gonna die?

01:47.900 --> 01:49.856
It was Nathan's mission
to protect Kira,

01:49.986 --> 01:51.692
to protect all of us.

01:51.821 --> 01:53.652
Kira's electricity Trouble

01:53.781 --> 01:56.864
was our only hope
against the darkness.

01:56.993 --> 02:00.781
She was my fiancee,
and Nathan got her killed.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.538
He's gonna get us all killed.

02:04.667 --> 02:07.204
- Yeah!
- We can't let him stay here.

02:10.840 --> 02:13.206
- You want me to banish Nathan?
- No.

02:13.342 --> 02:15.253
- You're supposed to keep us safe
from people like him.

02:15.386 --> 02:18.093
- The safety of the group
is the most important thing, but I will...

02:18.222 --> 02:21.089
- You need to hear Nathan out.
- I will hear Nathan out.

02:21.225 --> 02:22.886
- Listen, Dwight,
we've survived this far

02:23.019 --> 02:25.852
because you've been strong
and you've been fair.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.562
You can't let Nathan off
just because he's your friend.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.071
- Wait, so you're saying Kira's not dead?

02:38.200 --> 02:40.942
- She's alive.
Underground, but her leg's pinned.

02:41.078 --> 02:42.033
I couldn't free her.

02:42.163 --> 02:44.745
She's using her Trouble to power
a light to keep the darkness off.

02:44.874 --> 02:48.787
- We just came this close to a riot. Why do
you want people thinking Kira's dead?

02:48.919 --> 02:50.375
- 'Cause we found William's aether.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.789
(panting)

02:51.922 --> 02:53.048
- What?

02:53.174 --> 02:55.381
- Haven's on the edge of chaos,
and you want to throw in

02:55.509 --> 02:57.090
the supernatural equivalent
of plutonium?

02:57.219 --> 03:00.052
- If people knew that Kira
was alive, they'd go after her.

03:00.181 --> 03:02.297
We'd never be able
to keep the aether a secret.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.970
- They would scramble for it
hoping that it would be a cure.

03:05.102 --> 03:08.344
- Which it won't. Kirk thought
it would help him, and it got him killed.

03:08.481 --> 03:11.644
No, under all circumstances
the aether must remain a secret.

03:11.776 --> 03:13.687
Mara couldn't find the aether.
How did you?

03:13.819 --> 03:16.811
- A machine Seth left behind led me to it.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.438
Now Charlotte can make a cure.
- Nathan...

03:19.575 --> 03:22.567
- Charlotte said if she has aether,
she can make a cure.

03:23.996 --> 03:26.373
Freeing Kira
is a two-person job.

03:26.499 --> 03:29.036
That's why I came back.
But we have to go now.

03:29.168 --> 03:31.659
She's been awake for 24 hours.
She falls asleep, she dies.

03:31.796 --> 03:34.583
- I let you walk out of here,
I will have a riot on my hands.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.706
- Then banish me.
- No, I'm going with you.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.252
- No, people need you here.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.251
- People need you.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.878
Besides, how is Charlotte
gonna help you

03:42.014 --> 03:43.800
with the aether
if you're locked outside?

03:45.393 --> 03:47.600
We got to figure out
another way to fix this.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.561
- You better hurry up. They're already
growing restless in the gym.

03:50.689 --> 03:53.681
Tony's riling them up to take justice
into their own hands if need be.

03:53.818 --> 03:56.605
- Fine, leave me here.
You go. Take Charlotte.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.444
- Dwight, you're the only reason
that that crowd calmed down.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.359
If you're not here,
they come for Nathan.

04:01.492 --> 04:02.527
- She's right.

04:02.660 --> 04:06.278
- Those people are just scared,
and they are taking their fear out on me.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.531
The sooner you go, the sooner
you bring Kira back, this all goes away.

04:09.667 --> 04:13.455
- I can't risk this place coming apart.
- No, you can't.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.452
We need to give the people
what they want.

04:15.589 --> 04:19.832
- What they want is my head.
- No, what they want is justice.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.839
We need to put Nathan on trial.

04:25.266 --> 04:28.178
(somber folk music)

04:56.589 --> 04:59.831
- You want to put me on trial?
- They're so angry he'll be found guilty.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.253
- It will never get that far.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.843
All that matters is time.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.180
- Nothing's slower than a legal proceeding.
That's brilliant.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.925
lt'll give you plenty of time
to rescue Kira.

05:11.061 --> 05:14.189
- I like it for another reason too.

05:16.484 --> 05:20.147
- So you want us to decide
what happens to Nathan? Why?

05:22.072 --> 05:25.360
- You think we've survived
because I'm strong?

05:25.493 --> 05:29.202
No, we've survived this long
because you all are.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.618
Your stability
doesn't depend on me. It can't.

05:32.750 --> 05:35.082
I could die tonight.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.709
The old courts and lawyers,
they don't seem appropriate.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.923
- Agreed.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.417
We're still in crisis mode.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.384
- Maybe we come up
with a simple, reliable...

05:46.514 --> 05:48.050
- Justice system.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.047
- Yeah, a good one,

05:50.184 --> 05:52.049
not based on fear.

05:52.186 --> 05:55.599
Listen, if we do this,
can you all be deliberative,

05:55.731 --> 05:58.222
calm, fair?

05:58.567 --> 06:01.479
(crowd murmuring)

06:04.073 --> 06:05.483
- Yes.

06:05.616 --> 06:09.074
- Work with Vince and Dave
on what kind of trial.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.568
I want your input.

06:13.249 --> 06:14.785
- Thank you, Dwight.

06:22.508 --> 06:23.497
- l'm unclear.

06:23.634 --> 06:26.376
Is this trial a stalling tactic,

06:26.512 --> 06:29.345
or is it the rebirth
of democracy?

06:29.473 --> 06:31.509
- Can't it be both?

06:31.642 --> 06:33.758
Keep the process legit
while I'm gone.

06:38.315 --> 06:42.149
- Just stop the car. Stop the car!

06:45.447 --> 06:46.653
I want to do it again.

06:46.782 --> 06:47.862
- No, you don't.

06:47.992 --> 06:49.528
- Hey, you ran me over.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.025
My power's activated
because of you.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.153
- Only 'cause I was trying to save your life.
Don't make me regret it!

06:54.290 --> 06:55.370
(groans)

06:55.499 --> 06:57.035
What you are trying to do,

06:57.167 --> 06:59.294
you have no idea
how dangerous it is.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.627
(grunts)
Stop.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.336
You are gonna kill yourself.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.548
- I'm gonna get killed anyway.

07:06.677 --> 07:10.261
I might as well do it on my own terms.
And I'm not gonna stop.

07:11.599 --> 07:14.090
If I did it once,
I can do it again.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.639
- Wait!
(sighs)

07:17.771 --> 07:19.147
(groans)

07:23.110 --> 07:26.728
When I almost hit you
with the car,

07:26.864 --> 07:27.979
what were you thinking about?

07:28.115 --> 07:29.821
Was there anything else
in your world

07:29.950 --> 07:32.737
orjust the car?

07:32.870 --> 07:35.486
- Just the car.
- Exactly.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.909
You need to focus.

07:38.042 --> 07:40.033
Your mom said she wasn't...

07:40.169 --> 07:43.286
passing through the wall,
she was becoming the wall.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.335
- | get it.

07:49.553 --> 07:50.963
- Great.

07:57.561 --> 07:58.641
(exhales)

08:05.944 --> 08:07.320
- I did it!

08:09.239 --> 08:10.900
- Yeah, terrific.

08:13.577 --> 08:14.908
- Good morning, Haven.

08:15.037 --> 08:16.573
This is Dave Teagues here,

08:16.705 --> 08:20.118
coming at you
from the principal’s ofﬁce.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.457
- We are not disc jockeys, Dave.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.451
Have you no gravitas?

08:24.588 --> 08:27.125
- Okay, ﬁne,
you do it, Gravy Ass.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.088
(clears throat)

08:29.927 --> 08:31.792
- In consultation with Tony,

08:31.929 --> 08:34.796
we have decided that
the best trial for our situation

08:34.932 --> 08:38.971
is the kind they used to hold
long ago in Athens.

08:39.103 --> 08:43.346
Everyone gets to vote on the
accused’s guilt or innocence.

08:47.695 --> 08:51.233
- Even if they banish me,
I'll survive. Been doing it for days.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.731
- You've been doing it for years.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.073
- Athenian tribunals are simple.

08:59.206 --> 09:03.575
Speaking for the dead
is Kira's fiance, Tony.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.417
Nathan will speak for himself.

09:05.546 --> 09:09.585
He is charged
with endangering group safety.

09:09.717 --> 09:12.925
- If convicted,
Nathan will be banished.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.590
We now take a short recess.
Then Tony will begin--

09:15.723 --> 09:18.556
- Hold on.
Point of order.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.804
When we talked about setting up
this tribunal,

09:24.940 --> 09:28.228
the Teagues said
that we'd adhere to the rules.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.021
- Oh, absolutely.

09:30.154 --> 09:32.861
There can be no bias
or favoritism whatsoever.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.322
- Well, I taught history
in this school for ten years,

09:35.451 --> 09:39.569
and under Athenian law,
the prosecutor sets the punishment.

09:39.705 --> 09:44.995
When you said "banishment"
without asking me,

09:45.127 --> 09:47.743
you weren't trying to rig things
in Nathan's favor, were you?

09:47.880 --> 09:51.168
(crowd murmuring)

09:51.300 --> 09:54.337
- Oh, certainly not.

09:54.470 --> 09:56.677
| just assumed...

09:56.805 --> 09:59.592
What sentence do you seek?

09:59.725 --> 10:03.968
- Banishment isn't enough for Nathan.

10:04.104 --> 10:08.063
He can survive out there
and continue to endanger us.

10:08.192 --> 10:12.060
There is only one safe course.

10:12.196 --> 10:14.653
Nathan Wuornos...

10:14.782 --> 10:16.272
must die.

10:18.035 --> 10:22.028
- We will take a short recess
before proceeding.

10:23.457 --> 10:27.325
- Isn't that a bit extreme?
- It's up to the people to decide.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.793
- I understand you're grieving, but...

10:29.922 --> 10:33.665
- Come on,
this isn't about vengeance.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.757
This is about our survival.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.502
| only sought the death penalty
after reviewing

10:38.639 --> 10:40.175
Nathan's entire record,

10:40.307 --> 10:43.424
and you have a long history
of harming this town.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.391
- What are you talking about?

10:45.521 --> 10:47.136
- Most recently,

10:49.358 --> 10:52.020
Duke Crocker was trying to leave Haven
so his Trouble bomb

10:52.152 --> 10:54.484
wouldn't hurt anyone
until Nathan stopped him.

10:54.613 --> 10:58.526
Nathan is the reason
that everyone is Troubled now.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.159
This is just one example l'll cite.

11:02.287 --> 11:03.663
- Where'd you get that information?

11:03.789 --> 11:05.825
- I don't have to tell you that.

11:05.958 --> 11:09.200
But thank you for confirming it's true.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.507
- Tony must have an informant.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.507
- Who?

11:25.644 --> 11:27.430
- Someone who wants me dead.

11:32.276 --> 11:35.359
- Athenian rules
require that we let Tony

11:35.487 --> 11:37.023
make his case without delay.

11:37.155 --> 11:39.146
- Screw the rules.
Just stop the tribunal.

11:39.283 --> 11:40.864
- We cannot screw the rules.

11:40.993 --> 11:42.779
- Somebody has it out for Nathan.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.869
- I agree, but there's nothing
we can do about that right now.

11:45.998 --> 11:50.116
Didn't you hear how they reacted
when Tony accused me of favoritism?

11:50.252 --> 11:51.537
- Vince is right.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.126
It seems pretty clear that Tony

11:53.255 --> 11:54.620
can incite that crowd
in a second.

11:55.257 --> 11:59.341
- What if we could find a legal way
to stop it, to slow it down?

11:59.469 --> 12:01.551
- As in to find a loophole in the rules?

12:01.680 --> 12:04.217
- Yeah. You love loopholes.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.340
Maybe there's something
in the library.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.603
Well, let's go.

12:11.857 --> 12:15.224
- This isn't how it's supposed to go.
- Trial's still a good idea.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.770
Gives Dwight time to find Kira,

12:16.904 --> 12:20.567
but Kira needs to be alive
when he gets there.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.860
So I need you to solve
this darkness Trouble.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.733
- No, I am not leaving you.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.610
- We still have time here, Parker.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.362
Let the trial run its course.

12:28.498 --> 12:32.582
But if the darkness kills Kira, then...

12:32.711 --> 12:34.247
- Saving Kira saves you.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.960
- Exactly.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.831
- Whatever gets you out of this.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.085
- Nathan kept us alive yesterday.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.133
The engineer's death
wasn't his fault.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.099
- Nathan's as good as any Ranger
when he keeps his eyes down.

12:50.979 --> 12:54.187
(doors slamming)

12:54.316 --> 12:55.772
- lt's harmless.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.563
Just a poltergeist Trouble
that slams things shut.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.398
- Problem is,
when Nathan looks up

13:01.531 --> 13:03.487
at some pie in the sky, he trips.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.858
Brings people down with him.
You made him look up.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.575
Sent him for aether
while people were dying.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.365
- No, I didn't, Dwight.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.989
| asked Nathan
not to leave the power plant.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.036
The only reason
I told him about the aether

13:14.169 --> 13:16.911
was because I thought
I was gonna die.

13:17.047 --> 13:21.916
I figured maybe someday
he and Audrey could try.

13:22.052 --> 13:24.759
- You really do think there's a way
to cure the Troubles after all.

13:31.728 --> 13:32.934
- Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

13:33.063 --> 13:36.226
(laughs)
Ready?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.809
(laughs)

13:40.946 --> 13:42.811
- You have to focus.

13:42.948 --> 13:45.690
You rematerialize too soon, you're gonna
end up as part of the gate.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.987
I'm gonna be picking you out of it.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.657
- Is that how my mom died?

13:54.459 --> 13:55.448
- Yeah.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.211
That's why they're called Troubles,
not powers.

14:01.133 --> 14:04.546
- And what about you?
Do you have any Troubles?

14:07.139 --> 14:09.755
- No.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.722
I'm just a normal guy.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.181
- Aw, damn,

14:15.313 --> 14:16.928
I did rematerialize too soon.

14:17.065 --> 14:19.021
- See? You're bleeding.
- Oh.

14:19.151 --> 14:23.895
My heel must have got stuck
in the metal.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.568
What?
Are you squeamish around blood?

14:26.700 --> 14:29.737
- No.
Here.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.201
Put this on.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.535
(groans)

14:35.333 --> 14:37.289
Hold that there.
- Okay.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.053
- Oh, my God.

14:47.179 --> 14:50.387
My husband is dead?
(sobs)

14:50.515 --> 14:52.551
- I'm sorry.

14:55.562 --> 14:58.554
(sobbing)

15:02.569 --> 15:04.651
- How?

15:06.698 --> 15:09.531
- The darkness killed him.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.614
- Then I vote for Nathan to die.

15:13.747 --> 15:18.332
He abandoned that power plant,
and now my husband is dead!

15:18.460 --> 15:23.750
- Listen, your husband said that he saw
a man emerge from the darkness unharmed.

15:23.882 --> 15:27.966
That man is the person
with the darkness Trouble.

15:28.095 --> 15:29.676
Please, did Rolf say anything?

15:29.805 --> 15:31.921
- Just go away!

15:34.142 --> 15:36.758
- Listen, Peggy,

15:36.895 --> 15:41.605
l-l couldn't save your husband, all right?

15:42.651 --> 15:46.143
But please let me try
to save you and your kids.

15:50.534 --> 15:53.776
- Rolf was with another man at the time.

15:54.955 --> 15:58.368
He might have seen
the Troubled person too.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.913
Name's... Furber?

16:02.045 --> 16:04.752
Tall guy, nose ring.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.417
- Is it Faber, maybe?

16:06.550 --> 16:11.135
Is it Faber Haskins?
- Yes, that's it. Do you know him?

16:13.348 --> 16:15.009
- l've arrested him twice.

16:15.142 --> 16:18.509
Aggravated assault, bad guy.

16:18.645 --> 16:21.432
- One ancient Greek
compared the tribunal

16:21.565 --> 16:22.600
to a cattle stampede.

16:22.732 --> 16:24.108
It cannot be stopped.

16:24.234 --> 16:27.317
- But who knows
what Tony will divulge next?

16:27.445 --> 16:29.731
We have to stop him.
- But we can't.

16:29.865 --> 16:31.480
- Oh, watch me
take out his kneecaps.

16:31.616 --> 16:36.326
- Guys! The noose is around my neck,
not yours.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.824
Just let the trial proceed.

16:38.957 --> 16:41.744
- But who knows what he'll say?

16:41.877 --> 16:43.833
And how does he know all this?

16:43.962 --> 16:47.250
- He has my entire record.
I'd like to hear that.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.247
lf Tony's gonna
make this personal...

16:49.384 --> 16:51.796
- What?

16:51.928 --> 16:54.965
If I'm gonna make this personal,
what?

16:59.978 --> 17:03.186
I stand behind what I've done.

17:03.315 --> 17:08.275
- And I'm gonna take you down
for what you did to Kira,

17:08.403 --> 17:10.394
for what you did to Haven.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.525
You're gonna burn.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.910
(grunting)

17:26.254 --> 17:28.290
(grunting)

17:40.185 --> 17:43.427
- Here's what I don't get. The last
thing you built to end the Troubles...

17:43.563 --> 17:45.269
The Barn... was gonna
kill all the Troubled people...

17:45.398 --> 17:48.515
- It was the only way I knew
how to eradicate Troubles.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.688
I had to protect
against a far greater evil,

17:50.820 --> 17:52.526
should it ever rear its head.

17:52.656 --> 17:55.443
- What greater evil?
- We don't know much about it.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.190
We don't want to.

17:57.327 --> 18:01.195
lt lives in the Void and
feeds off aether and Troubles.

18:01.331 --> 18:04.698
If it would ever escape,
you can't imagine the destruction.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.370
- I've seen
some pretty awful things.

18:06.503 --> 18:10.712
- No one in your world has seen
anything quite like this.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.796
I lost my husband to it.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.295
- I'm sorry.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.382
- It was a long time ago.

18:19.683 --> 18:21.219
(sighs)

18:21.351 --> 18:23.717
- The Troubles are running rampant
in Haven right now.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.105
So are we in any danger
from this greater evil?

18:28.441 --> 18:29.772
- I don't know.

18:33.405 --> 18:35.612
- Duke didn't want
to trouble everyone.

18:35.740 --> 18:37.071
Nathan did.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.737
And that’s just
the latest chapter.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.246
Nathan once had,
in his clutches,

18:42.372 --> 18:44.954
the woman
who created the Troubles.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.415
Did he turn her into The Guard
as Dwight wanted?

18:47.544 --> 18:51.253
No, he ran off to
a romantic cabin in the woods.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.791
And that is where I believe

18:52.924 --> 18:54.084
she recruited him

18:54.217 --> 18:57.630
to help spread the Troubles.
- That's not true.

19:01.558 --> 19:05.642
- Do you know why there was
so much damage, why the Troubles

19:05.770 --> 19:08.056
didn't end for 27 years?

19:09.941 --> 19:11.351
- I will pull the fire alarm.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.861
If that doesn't work,
I will set fire to this school.

19:13.987 --> 19:15.852
- Parker...
- He is lying to everyone.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.195
- His facts are true.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.030
His interpretation's a bit off.

19:19.159 --> 19:23.949
- Every bad thing
that has ever befal/en Haven,

19:24.080 --> 19:26.196
Nathan has had some

19:26.333 --> 19:28.494
key role in.

19:28.626 --> 19:31.789
How does this connect to Kira?

19:31.921 --> 19:34.503
Because Kira knew

19:34.632 --> 19:37.009
these dark secrets about him,

19:37.135 --> 19:40.172
and Nathan got her killed
to silence her.

19:40.305 --> 19:41.795
- She's not dead!

19:41.931 --> 19:44.343
- Shh! Not yet she isn't.

19:44.476 --> 19:47.183
Let's keep it that way.
How's the case coming?

19:47.312 --> 19:50.270
- Faber Haskins may be
an eyewitness, but I can't find him.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.979
- I heard him.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.485
His crew might be
in the basement.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.353
You be careful.
- I know who I'm dealing with.

19:57.489 --> 19:59.775
(Tony): We were planning
on getting married in Venice.

19:59.908 --> 20:05.028
Now we 7/ never get to do it
all because Nathan had it out for her

20:05.163 --> 20:08.951
the same way he’s got it out
for everyone in Haven.

20:09.084 --> 20:12.497
(men shouting)

20:12.629 --> 20:14.210
- Help!

20:14.339 --> 20:16.295
- Help! No!
- Get him in there.

20:16.424 --> 20:17.504
- Get him in there!
- Help!

20:17.634 --> 20:20.171
(overlapping shouting)

20:20.303 --> 20:23.295
(growling)

20:23.431 --> 20:27.299
- Hey! Freeze!
No, don't move.

20:27.435 --> 20:30.222
- Detective Parker,
glad you could join us.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.596
- Faber, open the door.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.155
You've been busy down here, Faber.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.579
- Protecting the public,
since you're so useless at it.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.997
- Did you see someone
survive the darkness?

20:56.131 --> 20:59.419
- Lights went out in the boiler room.
Three people got flayed,

20:59.551 --> 21:01.758
except for one bearded dude
with a yellow bandanna.

21:01.886 --> 21:05.253
He came strolling out like
he's sneaking out of Sunday school.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.927
- So now you're just randomly
throwing in bearded men?

21:08.059 --> 21:10.721
- Until somebody survives

21:10.854 --> 21:12.810
and the Troubled one is lD'd.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.554
- That's first-degree murder.

21:14.691 --> 21:17.478
- Yeah, well, that crap
doesn't matter anymore, does it?

21:17.610 --> 21:20.147
- You need to let Grayson go.

21:20.280 --> 21:24.023
He has a different Trouble.
I helped him last week.

21:25.618 --> 21:26.653
- Is that true?

21:26.786 --> 21:30.950
- He can't hear you.
He is hearing impaired.

21:41.801 --> 21:44.258
- Turn tail, sweet cheeks.

21:44.387 --> 21:47.094
Let me see 'em swish
as you leave.

21:47.223 --> 21:49.339
- I don't think so.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.341
- Well, you know
there's five of us, right?

21:51.478 --> 21:52.843
There's one of you.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.219
You might get a shot off,

21:54.355 --> 21:59.850
maybe two
before we have our way with you.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.536
(screaming)

22:27.680 --> 22:29.932
(panting)

22:30.058 --> 22:33.221
- Come on, get up.
Come on.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.553
Get them out.
Get them out of here.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.017
- How'd you know?

22:39.150 --> 22:40.936
- Nathan, he said
you might need some backup.

22:41.069 --> 22:44.186
- Where are you gonna take 'em?
- Dwight gave me one mandate...

22:44.322 --> 22:45.937
Don't let a riot break out.

22:46.074 --> 22:48.440
And given what's brewing
upstairs over your boyfriend,

22:48.576 --> 22:51.568
I don't have enough manpower for crowd
control and keeping these guys under guard.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.240
- So you're taking them
to the Sandman

22:53.373 --> 22:54.783
to put them in that sleep.

22:54.916 --> 22:56.281
- It's the only choice I got.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.328
- Well, they deserve much worse.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.453
- Is he gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

23:30.159 --> 23:32.866
- This is not a restaurant.

23:32.996 --> 23:34.406
- Surprise!

23:34.539 --> 23:37.747
- No, I am not going
to help you rob a bank.

23:37.875 --> 23:40.582
- | just wanted to practice
on thicker walls.

23:40.712 --> 23:43.419
- And take $31,000
while you're at it.

23:43.548 --> 23:46.130
- Well, while I'm here.
- Damn it, Hailie.

23:46.259 --> 23:48.671
- Like you and Dad never
stole back in the day, huh?

23:48.803 --> 23:52.387
- Not the point.
Look, I'm not even against stealing.

23:52.515 --> 23:54.756
I am against you
using your Trouble to do it.

23:54.892 --> 23:57.884
- Those men will kill me
if I don't get that money.

24:01.024 --> 24:02.764
- And if I don't?

24:02.900 --> 24:05.983
- I'll do it without you.
(sighs)

24:06.571 --> 24:09.187
- One condition.

24:09.324 --> 24:12.657
You never use your Trouble
again after this.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.197
- I promise.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.286
- All right, make it fast.

24:21.419 --> 24:22.784
- Okay.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.880
- Great.

24:38.811 --> 24:41.678
- l have something
better than a fire alarm.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.350
I'm going to use Grayson.
- Parker.

24:43.483 --> 24:45.519
- I'm going to have him
set off his Trouble,

24:45.652 --> 24:47.188
and everyone in the school
will scatter.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.185
Can you meet me
outside of the police station?

24:49.322 --> 24:51.358
- Audrey, no.
- N... are you crazy?

24:51.491 --> 24:53.197
Tony has made you
sound like a monster.

24:53.326 --> 24:56.193
There is no way that that jury
is going to acquit you now.

24:56.329 --> 24:59.196
- The sound that Grayson makes
is so painful,

24:59.332 --> 25:02.870
it activated five other Troubles last time.
We can risk a chain reaction.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.412
- I don't care, all right?

25:04.545 --> 25:09.414
I will do anything to save you.
- Oh, you're stealing my line.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.051
When you went into the Barn,

25:11.177 --> 25:14.590
l was willing to risk anything
to keep you with me

25:14.722 --> 25:16.383
while you faced your fate
head-on.

25:16.516 --> 25:20.930
- It is not your fate to be executed
for something that you didn't do.

25:21.062 --> 25:24.520
- But that's just it.
Some of what Tony said, I did do.

25:24.649 --> 25:26.856
So I feel like
I'm on trial for being me,

25:26.984 --> 25:29.851
or at least the me
that I've become

25:29.987 --> 25:32.069
since I fell in love with you.

25:34.075 --> 25:36.782
I want to defend that.

25:37.704 --> 25:40.992
- Nathan, that's really noble,

25:41.124 --> 25:44.161
but you're not...

25:44.293 --> 25:46.500
You're not exactly
a public speaker.

25:46.629 --> 25:49.917
- Parker, do not use Grayson.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.165
People will get hurt.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.678
Please.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.419
- Okay, what is your defense?

25:56.556 --> 25:58.342
You're going to counter-punch
with something, right?

25:58.474 --> 25:59.850
- No, I won't attack him.

26:01.436 --> 26:03.518
Though I could.

26:03.646 --> 26:05.978
Tony said he and Kira
were getting married in Venice.

26:06.107 --> 26:08.940
Last night, Kira told me that Venice
would've been a huge mistake.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.525
I didn't know what she meant, but...

26:11.654 --> 26:15.238
- She changed her mind
about marrying Tony?

26:15.366 --> 26:19.075
But under the rules, he has no right
to speak for the dead and prosecute you.

26:19.203 --> 26:23.116
That's... that's great.
Use that.

26:31.799 --> 26:35.508
- Let me worry
about my defense.

26:35.636 --> 26:40.005
Right now, you need to solve
the darkness Trouble. lf Kira dies...

26:42.143 --> 26:44.225
All bets are off for me.

26:47.398 --> 26:50.014
- Nathan said
it's not much farther.

26:50.151 --> 26:53.518
We just have to get...

26:53.654 --> 26:56.646
down there.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.240
- So about this new cure...

26:59.368 --> 27:01.108
- I thought you weren't
interested in a cure.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.826
- Of course I am.

27:02.955 --> 27:07.824
ljust want to live the life l have and not
wait for the one that may never happen.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.496
So you never said
what was different.

27:09.629 --> 27:12.792
Last I heard, you had to kill people
to end the Troubles. So what changed?

27:15.802 --> 27:17.167
- It's the poltergeist Trouble.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.043
We're trapped.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.094
That was fast.

27:24.227 --> 27:25.182
Thanks.

27:25.311 --> 27:26.676
- Don't thank me yet.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.350
I had to drop the rope to get
the glow stick out in time.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.438
- With all our supplies?

27:31.567 --> 27:33.853
- And our light sources.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.977
This glow stick is all we have.

28:05.351 --> 28:08.058
(applause)
- Thanks, folks. Thanks.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.927
It's not a happy day.

28:10.064 --> 28:12.601
The trial isn't over yet.

28:19.907 --> 28:21.488
- But no beard.

28:30.209 --> 28:34.452
- Rather than be
a disembodied voice over the PA,

28:34.589 --> 28:38.832
Nathan has asked to make
his appeal to you in person.

28:38.968 --> 28:44.008
Those of you who are not in the gymnasium
can join us in here,

28:44.140 --> 28:47.348
or you can listen
from wherever you are.

28:47.476 --> 28:50.092
Nathan will begin momentarily.

28:54.650 --> 28:58.359
- Tony, when did you shave?

28:58.487 --> 28:59.613
- Two days ago, why?

28:59.739 --> 29:01.354
- Three days ago,
a bearded man

29:01.490 --> 29:06.359
with a yellow bandanna
walked out of a dark boiler room.

29:06.495 --> 29:08.235
VVasthatyou?

29:08.372 --> 29:09.908
- I got lucky.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.248
- I don't think luck
had anything to do with it.

29:12.376 --> 29:16.210
- What? You think this is my Trouble?
No way.

29:16.339 --> 29:21.003
No, you're trying
to undermine me to save Nathan.

29:21.135 --> 29:24.093
- No one else survived.
No one.

29:24.221 --> 29:25.381
- Doesn't mean anything.

29:25.514 --> 29:27.596
- Yes, it does.

29:27.725 --> 29:30.842
We know that Kira
broke off your engagement.

29:30.978 --> 29:32.263
- No, she didn't.

29:32.396 --> 29:34.512
- Is the breakup
what activated your Trouble?

29:34.649 --> 29:36.435
The same day
that the darkness started?

29:36.567 --> 29:38.432
- That's a coincidence,
and it was a spat.

29:38.569 --> 29:39.979
It wasn't a breakup.

29:48.412 --> 29:52.325
- Tony, the darkness is growing.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.621
You need to stop it,
or we will all die.

30:12.103 --> 30:14.059
Tony, this is getting worse.

30:14.188 --> 30:16.179
You need to accept
that this is you.

30:16.315 --> 30:17.816
- Can't be me.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.352
Kira didn't leave me.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.816
- Yes, she did.

30:22.780 --> 30:23.735
(grunts)

30:39.255 --> 30:41.792
- The research I did

30:41.924 --> 30:44.461
when you thought
I was a CDC doctor,

30:44.593 --> 30:48.211
that's what's different
from the last time.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.554
Now I think there might be
a way to cure Troubles

30:50.683 --> 30:52.469
without killing people.

30:52.601 --> 30:56.469
I never would've seen it
if Nathan hadn't kept pushing me.

30:56.605 --> 31:00.063
- Yeah, he can be stubborn.

31:00.443 --> 31:03.606
- I just wanted you
to know that

31:04.238 --> 31:06.069
it's not impossible.

31:06.866 --> 31:09.073
- Your timing is stunning.

31:11.746 --> 31:14.112
- Hi, everybody.

31:16.542 --> 31:17.622
(exhales)

31:21.130 --> 31:24.463
I've been Troubled
since I was a kid.

31:24.592 --> 31:27.504
My dad, Garland Wuornos...
Most of you knew him...

31:27.636 --> 31:29.672
He was Troubled too.

31:29.805 --> 31:31.670
Helping Troubled people

31:31.807 --> 31:34.344
has been the family business
for a long time.

31:34.477 --> 31:38.095
Let me tell you, I wouldn't wish
a Trouble on my worst enemy.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.936
- Maybe that's
what your Trouble's about.

31:40.066 --> 31:42.933
You refuse to look
at the dark, emotional truth.

31:43.069 --> 31:44.684
You're scared
that it might kill you.

31:44.820 --> 31:48.529
And then that fear,
it manifests itself literally.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.613
And now that I'm trying
to make you face it,

31:50.743 --> 31:53.530
you're making the room darker,
and we're all going to die.

31:53.662 --> 31:55.994
You need to accept
that she broke up with you.

31:56.373 --> 31:58.705
You need to accept
that you're doing these things.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.950
- I'm not.
- Tony’s right.

32:01.087 --> 32:02.623
l have been front and center

32:02.755 --> 32:05.246
for the awful events
in Haven's recent history.

32:05.382 --> 32:07.873
Why?
Because it's myjob.

32:08.010 --> 32:10.717
To help. It’s what I do.

32:10.846 --> 32:13.553
- This is getting nowhere.
Everyone, get closer. Get in the light.

32:13.682 --> 32:15.058
Get your light sources out.

32:15.184 --> 32:18.426
Use your flashlights,
your cell phone, get a lighter.

32:18.562 --> 32:22.350
- I’ve dedicated my life
to helping ease the Troubles.

32:22.483 --> 32:25.065
Some of you know that there have
even been a few times

32:25.194 --> 32:26.730
when things have gone my way.

32:26.862 --> 32:28.568
Tony didn't mention
any of those.

32:28.697 --> 32:33.862
Guess that's 'cause it's just
the way the Troubles are.

32:33.994 --> 32:36.030
- We are going
to use these to get out.

32:36.163 --> 32:37.198
I'm gonna take the kids first.

32:37.331 --> 32:38.616
Come here.

32:38.749 --> 32:40.956
Yeah, you, stick together.

32:41.085 --> 32:42.450
Here we go.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.918
Keep going, good, out this way.

32:45.047 --> 32:48.005
- I'm not trying
to duck anything.

32:48.134 --> 32:52.594
I guess for me it's
more important to keep going.

32:52.721 --> 32:55.428
And the only way
to do that is,

32:55.558 --> 32:57.924
ﬁrst, you don ’t deny
how bad it is.

32:58.060 --> 32:59.345
Face it,

32:59.478 --> 33:01.184
no matter how scared you are.

33:01.313 --> 33:05.682
You have to light up the dark
with hope.

33:05.818 --> 33:07.183
- Okay, they're good. They're safe.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.571
There's enough light
out there to keep them safe.

33:09.697 --> 33:11.562
Keep staying close.
Stay in the light, close.

33:11.699 --> 33:13.781
- Doesn't matter
how dim the hope seems.

33:13.909 --> 33:18.619
Hope and love, which is
what hope is really about,

33:18.747 --> 33:22.456
can come out
in the darkest places.

33:22.585 --> 33:24.621
The Troubles
have made Haven dark,

33:24.753 --> 33:27.335
but we can light it up again,

33:27.464 --> 33:29.329
keep trying
to make things better

33:29.466 --> 33:31.081
even when it seems impossible.

33:31.218 --> 33:32.958
- Please.

33:36.307 --> 33:40.175
- We have to light up the dark
with hope.

33:40.311 --> 33:42.893
It's the only way
to make life worth living.

33:50.946 --> 33:53.608
Thank you.

34:01.498 --> 34:03.534
- It's funny.

34:03.667 --> 34:05.703
I think Nathan's optimism

34:05.836 --> 34:08.578
is kind of rubbing off on me.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.752
I thought we were gonna make it.

34:13.636 --> 34:14.967
- Me too.

34:18.015 --> 34:19.846
- Good-bye, Dwight.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.092
- Good-bye, Charlotte.

34:32.363 --> 34:35.355
Charlotte, you still alive?

34:35.491 --> 34:39.200
- Not sure how, but yeah.

34:59.473 --> 35:01.634
(sighs)

35:01.767 --> 35:03.678
- Kira did leave me,

35:03.811 --> 35:06.769
said I couldn't deal
with negative feelings.

35:10.317 --> 35:11.523
(clears throat)

35:11.652 --> 35:14.439
My Trouble has killed
so many people.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.193
I'm ready.

35:19.326 --> 35:23.319
l have to face my darkness
just like Nathan said.

35:26.333 --> 35:29.200
- Kira? We're coming.

35:29.336 --> 35:31.167
We're coming.
- Oh, thank God.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.835
- You're a brave young woman.

35:35.968 --> 35:39.426
You're gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.

35:40.097 --> 35:43.931
- Nathan was right. It's a two-person job.
I'll set up a lever.

35:47.146 --> 35:52.186
- As I suspected,
there's not nearly enough.

35:52.318 --> 35:54.309
- Of the swirly black stuff?

35:55.446 --> 35:57.528
Look over there.

36:10.419 --> 36:12.284
- I don't believe it.

36:12.421 --> 36:14.912
Nathan was right.

36:15.049 --> 36:17.131
I can end the Troubles.

36:36.278 --> 36:37.233
- Guess how much.

36:37.363 --> 36:41.732
- If it's a penny more than 31 K, put it back.
- You can keep the change.

36:41.867 --> 36:42.947
- No, thank you.

36:44.787 --> 36:47.449
Come on, we've been here too long.
Let's go.

36:47.581 --> 36:49.446
(alarm blaring)

36:49.583 --> 36:51.289
- Freeze!

36:51.418 --> 36:54.285
Put your hands on your head.
(screams)

37:00.344 --> 37:01.584
(groans)

37:01.720 --> 37:04.097
Put your hands on your head.

37:07.184 --> 37:08.139
(clatter)

37:11.730 --> 37:13.015
- You do have a Trouble.

37:14.191 --> 37:16.182
- It's not a Trouble.

37:20.072 --> 37:23.109
- Duke, your eyes.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.114
What are you doing?

37:28.247 --> 37:32.456
(grunting)

37:32.584 --> 37:33.744
- Run.

37:44.346 --> 37:47.179
- Who gave you this information
about Nathan?

37:47.307 --> 37:49.298
- Honestly, l-l don't know.

37:49.435 --> 37:51.175
l was alone in my room.

37:51.311 --> 37:53.802
I fell asleep or something,

37:53.939 --> 37:57.181
and when I came to,
it was all there.

37:57.317 --> 37:58.568
- Is this your handwriting?

37:58.694 --> 38:00.605
- No.

38:00.737 --> 38:02.693
- You didn't see or hear anything?

38:02.823 --> 38:07.863
- Like I said, I spaced out or...

38:07.995 --> 38:11.533
It's like time didn't exist for me.

38:11.665 --> 38:14.122
What could make a person
lose time like that?

38:22.885 --> 38:25.592
- There's still no sign of Dwight.

38:25.721 --> 38:30.806
Which means that your life
hangs on your eloquence.

38:30.934 --> 38:33.016
Your speech, it helped me
get through to Tony, though.

38:33.145 --> 38:35.261
It was really...
It was really good.

38:35.397 --> 38:37.638
- You think they heard it
with your ears?

38:37.774 --> 38:41.141
- If they didn't,
I'm going to use Grayson.

38:41.278 --> 38:44.270
- Hey.
- No, I don't care what you say.

38:44.406 --> 38:46.192
And have you seen him?

38:46.325 --> 38:49.158
- Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

38:49.286 --> 38:52.528
The votes have been tallied,
decision made.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.201
And the verdict is...

38:55.334 --> 38:57.791
- Hey look, it's Kira!

38:57.920 --> 38:59.911
(cheers and applause)

39:18.023 --> 39:20.355
- That's a hell of a lot
of aether you found.

40:06.613 --> 40:09.650
- Duke, please.

40:09.783 --> 40:12.320
Please. Please don't hurt me.

40:12.452 --> 40:15.114
- I don't want to hurt you.

40:20.419 --> 40:21.659
I'm sorry.

40:21.795 --> 40:22.910
(screams)

40:44.026 --> 40:46.187
(slurping)

40:49.197 --> 40:51.734
- Not exactly lobster
at The Gull.

40:51.867 --> 40:53.698
- I'll take it.
- So now what?

40:53.827 --> 40:55.863
How do we build the structure
to end the Troubles?

40:55.996 --> 40:58.908
- Step one,
concentrate that aether

40:59.041 --> 41:00.827
into a workable form.

41:00.959 --> 41:04.292
And there's so much.

41:04.421 --> 41:07.413
I'm gonna need a hand.

41:10.344 --> 41:13.836
I like your hand.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.883
But for that much aether,

41:16.016 --> 41:20.180
I'm gonna need another being
from my world.

41:20.312 --> 41:21.552
- You need Audrey.

41:21.688 --> 41:24.430
- We all do.

41:24.566 --> 41:26.557
More than ever.

41:31.114 --> 41:33.105
- Have you seen Grayson?

41:42.042 --> 41:44.033
Grayson?

41:58.266 --> 41:59.927
Grayson!

42:00.060 --> 42:01.220
Grayson!

42:08.110 --> 42:09.441
The Sandman.

42:15.909 --> 42:18.025
- I hate that name.
