Miranda, what are you doing?
You're supposed to be on stage!

00:41.416 --> 00:43.626
I can't go on stage right now. I'm busy!

00:46.337 --> 00:47.422
Busy doing what?

00:47.505 --> 00:50.675
Hello. I'm waiting for this
scab to form so I can pick it.

00:55.013 --> 00:56.890
Uh, change of plans.

00:57.557 --> 01:03.146
Please welcome to the stage
Colleen Ballinger!

01:09.110 --> 01:11.154
Oh, my God!

01:11.613 --> 01:13.740
Hello, everybody!

01:14.449 --> 01:16.159
This is crazy!

01:17.368 --> 01:21.831
We're doing a Netflix special
at the Kennedy Centre. What?

01:23.708 --> 01:25.293
This is nuts!

01:26.002 --> 01:27.587
Oh, my gosh.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.883
And you guys are never gonna
believe me when I tell you this, but...

01:31.966 --> 01:33.468
I'm pregnant.

01:38.389 --> 01:41.726
There's a tiny little
penis in there.

01:43.853 --> 01:45.897
Is that weird?
Are there kids here?

01:47.649 --> 01:51.444
You know, pregnancy
is the most beautiful,

01:51.528 --> 01:55.156
magical, wonderful thing
in the whole world...

01:55.615 --> 01:57.909
for everyone who isn't pregnant.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.870
I am so miserable.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.288
This is awful.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.874
No one tells you how
much this is gonna suck.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.334
I am so grumpy.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.211
I am in so much pain.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.170
I am constipated.

02:10.463 --> 02:12.841
And I've been to the doctor,
I've seen the baby.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.300
He's down here.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.594
So then, what's all this?

02:17.514 --> 02:19.516
People come up to me
and they want to rub my tummy,

02:19.577 --> 02:21.495
and they're like,
'Oh, how sweet. A baby,'

02:21.556 --> 02:24.851
and I'm like, 'That's not a baby.
I haven't pooped in two weeks.'

02:26.521 --> 02:28.982
'But keep rubbing.
Maybe it will help.'

02:30.275 --> 02:33.695
I'm very excited to have this little guy.
I can't wait to be a mom.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.738
But I'm gonna admit something
to you guys tonight.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.740
I am so nervous.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.325
I'm so nervous to have him.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.703
But I'm not nervous for the
reasons you might think.

02:41.786 --> 02:45.248
I'm not nervous 'cause I have
to push a baby out of my parts

02:45.331 --> 02:47.542
and they're all going to rip into pieces.

02:47.604 --> 02:48.984
I'm not nervous
because I'm going to be

02:49.045 --> 02:51.270
responsible for
another human being.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.632
I'm nervous because this kid
is going to have my genes,

02:54.739 --> 02:57.575
and I looked like this
when I was a baby!

03:00.471 --> 03:03.558
That's not photo shopped.
That's my actual face.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.019
And I know what you're thinking.

03:06.102 --> 03:08.855
You're thinking, 'Oh, that was
probably just an awkward phase.'

03:08.938 --> 03:11.316
You know, all babies look
weird in pictures sometimes.'

03:11.399 --> 03:15.153
Oh, no. I was a very ugly
baby, and I have proof.

03:15.653 --> 03:17.655
This is also me as a baby.

03:18.656 --> 03:20.909
And this is me as a baby.

03:21.246 --> 03:25.417
And my personal favourite...
This is me as a baby.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.131
And to any of you
out there who think,

03:32.192 --> 03:33.963
'Oh, you know what?
It'll get better.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.506
You know, you'll grow out of that,'

03:35.590 --> 03:38.801
you must be forgetting that
this is what I do for a living.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.887
So no, it doesn't get better.

03:41.311 --> 03:43.953
And if this kid looks anything
like me when he comes out,

03:44.014 --> 03:45.600
I'm gonna be like, 'Put him back!'

03:46.935 --> 03:50.146
Just kidding.
I'll love him no matter how ugly he is.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.815
I'll just love him less.

03:55.735 --> 03:58.738
Oh, how am I going to
explain that to my child?

03:59.906 --> 04:01.449
He's gonna be so confused.

04:01.532 --> 04:05.036
He's gonna think he lives in a
house with a mommy and a daddy,

04:05.119 --> 04:07.288
and sometimes mommy disappears

04:07.372 --> 04:09.666
and a crazy girl with lipstick
and a camel toe

04:09.749 --> 04:11.876
chases him around the
house with a camera.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.331
Like, what's he gonna
tell his friends

04:15.392 --> 04:16.714
that his mom does for a living?

04:16.798 --> 04:18.800
What's he gonna do?
Show them this picture?

04:18.882 --> 04:21.844
His friends are gonna be like,
'My mom's a doctor.'

04:21.928 --> 04:23.471
'Well, my mom's a teacher.'

04:23.554 --> 04:25.890
And he's gonna be like,
'My mom does this.'

04:26.632 --> 04:28.559
Oh, God. Why did I give him that voice?

04:29.009 --> 04:31.813
Just assuming he's doomed.

04:32.522 --> 04:33.577
Oh, God.

04:33.935 --> 04:35.209
We can get rid of that.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.954
You know, uh, I've
been doing that...

04:38.297 --> 04:40.863
for ten years now.
I've been doing Miranda.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.741
Whoo!

04:45.285 --> 04:48.705
So long of doing a character
that everybody hates.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.539
Everyone hates me. It's true.

04:51.708 --> 04:54.919
I have made a career off of
people hating my character.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.963
Are there any parents
in the audience tonight?

04:57.964 --> 05:00.425
Hey! Thanks for coming.

05:01.724 --> 05:03.893
You guys hate me the most.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.181
No, don't worry, though.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.559
If you're a parent and you
feel like you were just dragged

05:09.642 --> 05:11.853
to some dumb YouTuber's
show tonight,

05:11.936 --> 05:13.370
you were. Gotcha.

05:13.581 --> 05:14.441
But also,

05:14.904 --> 05:18.145
I try really hard to make my
show enjoyable for everybody.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.903
So yes, there are some
jokes for the kids tonight.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.365
But there's also a lot of
mature, inappropriate jokes

05:24.449 --> 05:26.409
that will go over
the kids' heads.

05:26.492 --> 05:29.329
No offence to you kids,
but you guys are... dumb,

05:29.412 --> 05:31.009
so they'll go over your heads...

05:31.456 --> 05:34.447
and then the parents will have
something to laugh at, don't worry.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.962
Uh, but it is true.
I get a lot of hate from the mothers.

05:38.046 --> 05:39.872
Hi. Uh...

05:40.715 --> 05:44.719
You all say the same thing to me
when you meet me, too, the moms.

05:44.802 --> 05:45.905
And I think

05:46.021 --> 05:48.264
you think this is a compliment,

05:48.348 --> 05:49.682
but you always say...

05:50.671 --> 05:52.935
'I don't know why
my kid likes you.'

05:54.508 --> 05:56.177
Fighting back tears.

05:57.106 --> 06:00.568
I remember this one time I met a girl
at a mall, and she was so sweet.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.070
I was so excited to meet her.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.197
She watched my videos.
She was a big fan.

06:04.614 --> 06:08.701
But her mom was standing, like,
two feet from us and she looked pissed.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.371
So I went up to her
to introduce myself,

06:11.454 --> 06:13.498
and she goes,
'Oh, I know who you are.'

06:14.624 --> 06:19.212
'If I have to hear your voice in my house
one more time, I swear to God...'

06:20.213 --> 06:21.213
And I was like...

06:21.714 --> 06:22.714
'Thank you.'

06:24.497 --> 06:26.530
I did an interview with this guy once,

06:26.886 --> 06:28.137
and he was so rude.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.431
He did not want to be
talking to me at all.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.133
And at the end of the
interview, he goes,

06:32.380 --> 06:35.019
'All right. I have
one final question.'

06:35.103 --> 06:37.105
I interview a lot of comedians.

06:37.188 --> 06:40.191
'Is there a reason why
they're funny and you're not?'

06:40.810 --> 06:42.177
True story. He said that.

06:42.576 --> 06:43.795
And in my head, I was like,

06:43.856 --> 06:45.822
'Well, is there a reason
why you're a dick?'

06:45.905 --> 06:47.573
But I didn't say that

06:47.657 --> 06:49.117
because there are kids here.

06:51.452 --> 06:52.954
I said something better.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.957
He said, 'Is there a reason why
comedians are funny and you're not?'

06:56.040 --> 06:57.040
And I said...

06:57.375 --> 06:58.418
'Thank you.'

06:58.501 --> 07:02.296
So I'm very uncomfortable when it
comes to confrontation and hate,

07:02.380 --> 07:05.174
but I'm a little bit better at it
when I can hide behind my camera

07:05.258 --> 07:06.217
like a coward.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.761
So I write songs about
the hate that I get,

07:08.845 --> 07:11.099
and I would love to sing one
for you guys tonight if that's cool?

07:12.325 --> 07:14.581
Yes! Awesome.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.229
I've got my ukulele.

07:21.524 --> 07:22.524
So...

07:23.109 --> 07:24.444
I have to warn you,

07:24.787 --> 07:30.265
all of the lyrics to this song are
hate comments that I have received.

07:30.326 --> 07:32.870
So there's a lot of bad words,

07:33.369 --> 07:35.913
and there is some crude
language in this song.

07:35.997 --> 07:39.542
So to all of the mothers that
I'm about to offend, um...

07:40.042 --> 07:41.042
thank you.

07:43.142 --> 07:44.306
'Why are you a YouTuber?

07:44.367 --> 07:46.858
I'm not a hater. I just hate your vids.
And your voice.'

07:47.925 --> 07:50.845
'You look uglier than my ass.
No ofoinse.'

07:52.221 --> 07:53.415
'Does she have cancer?

07:53.476 --> 07:55.123
Because I don't want to
make fun of her if she does.

07:55.183 --> 07:56.684
She's so effing annoying.'

07:57.351 --> 07:59.951
'Your cloths are so ugly.
Maybe you need to go into a model class.'

08:00.021 --> 08:01.212
Your cloths look like pyjamas.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.315
'You don't know
what you're wearing.

08:02.376 --> 08:04.835
You look good to you.
You look bad to me.'

08:05.980 --> 08:07.912

There you go!

10:08.376 --> 10:09.376
There you go.

10:10.776 --> 10:12.069
You know,

10:12.153 --> 10:14.655
I get a lot of hate, as you can see.

10:14.739 --> 10:15.521
Uh, but you know what?

10:15.582 --> 10:17.307
The hate doesn't really
bother me that much.

10:17.368 --> 10:20.496
I'm usually able to let the hate
just roll off my shoulders.

10:20.661 --> 10:22.108
But every once in a while,

10:22.206 --> 10:24.126
there's just one
comment that gets to me.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.529
This has happened
more frequently recently

10:26.626 --> 10:28.405
because I'm pregnant
and I'm very emotional.

10:28.466 --> 10:30.051
I cry at everything now.

10:30.199 --> 10:31.850
Um, so recently,
I was upset about

10:31.911 --> 10:33.417
some of the hate
comments I was getting,

10:33.478 --> 10:36.260
and I needed to do something
to make myself feel better.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.555
So I did something
that I know you all have done,

10:39.639 --> 10:42.183
so you cannot shame me
when I tell you what I did.

10:42.372 --> 10:43.851
But I Googled myself.

10:43.934 --> 10:44.607
See,

10:44.810 --> 10:47.772
I thought if I Googled
myself, I would feel better,

10:47.854 --> 10:49.004
but that's not what happened.

10:49.065 --> 10:52.151
What happened was
I noticed these words in bold.

10:52.526 --> 10:56.197
These are the most frequently searched
things on Google.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.823
So I thought I would play with this

10:57.907 --> 10:59.898
and see what you guys
were searching about me,

11:00.076 --> 11:03.162
and I typed in, 'Is Colleen Ballinger...'

11:03.537 --> 11:05.230
And the most frequently searched

11:05.291 --> 11:07.124
thing on Google
when you type in,

11:07.208 --> 11:09.752
'Is Colleen Ballinger...' is...

11:09.835 --> 11:11.003
'dead.'

11:13.631 --> 11:15.508
So that did not
make me feel better.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.843
So I tried something else.

11:17.927 --> 11:18.969
I typed in...

11:19.637 --> 11:21.305
'Did Colleen Ballinger...'

11:21.389 --> 11:23.679
And the most frequently
searched thing on Google

11:23.740 --> 11:27.118
when you type in,
'Did Colleen Ballinger...' is...

11:27.439 --> 11:28.439
'die.'

11:31.440 --> 11:32.290
So...

11:32.942 --> 11:35.194
I tried something
a little bit more obscure,

11:35.277 --> 11:38.406
and I typed in,
'Where was Colleen Ballinger...'

11:38.489 --> 11:40.574
thinking there is no way

11:40.658 --> 11:43.744
that this could
be about me dying.

11:43.828 --> 11:45.788
Well, I was wrong
because it was...

11:45.871 --> 11:46.694
'buried.'

11:49.667 --> 11:52.002
So thank you. I love my fans.

11:54.004 --> 11:57.011
So when Googling myself
did not make me feel any better,

11:57.072 --> 12:00.200
I did something that I've been
doing since I was a little girl

12:00.264 --> 12:01.891
every time I feel low.

12:01.952 --> 12:04.330
I wrote in my diary
about my feelings.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.892
Now, this is actually what
inspired my most recent book,

12:06.976 --> 12:09.061
called My Diarrhe
by Miranda Sings.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.212
Some of you brought it.
Thank you.

12:11.273 --> 12:12.578
You guys are the best!

12:13.649 --> 12:15.609
So, yes, I recently
came out with a book,

12:15.903 --> 12:19.365
and it's all of Miranda's
diaries duct-taped together.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.609
Now, the entire
inspiration for this book

12:21.700 --> 12:23.890
was my actual diaries as a child

12:23.951 --> 12:26.203
because they are
horrendously embarrassing.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.539
So I thought, to celebrate
such a special night,

12:28.622 --> 12:29.693
we're doing a Netflix special,

12:29.754 --> 12:31.917
we're at the Kennedy
Centre, this is epic.

12:32.001 --> 12:33.544
I should read to you

12:33.627 --> 12:36.448
some of my most
embarrassing pages

12:36.509 --> 12:38.424
from my diaries as a child.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.507
What do you think?

12:41.177 --> 12:42.177
Yes!

12:43.095 --> 12:45.097
I was gonna do it
even if you didn't scream,

12:45.181 --> 12:46.307
so thank you.

12:47.266 --> 12:50.686
So this is one of my diaries
from when I was a child.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.481
And I found some, uh,

12:53.564 --> 12:56.275
just very embarrassing pages
to read to you guys from.

12:56.358 --> 12:58.277
This is from when I
was about 12 years old,

12:58.360 --> 13:00.052
um, this picture
that I'm about to show you.

13:00.112 --> 13:01.112
Let's take a look.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.531
Yep, there it is.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.574
Oh, God.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.620
So it says...

13:07.703 --> 13:10.748
-It says, 'What's wrong with me?'
-Nothing!

13:10.831 --> 13:13.918
And I'm on the
'road to nowhere.'

13:15.920 --> 13:19.215
I want you guys to get
an idea in your mind

13:19.298 --> 13:21.467
of what I looked like
during this time of my life,

13:21.550 --> 13:24.386
this emo, depressed little girl.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.562
So I brought a picture of
myself for you guys to see...

13:28.432 --> 13:29.850
what I looked like then.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.394
Let's continue.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.062
Here we go.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.981
'Dear Marsha...'

13:36.065 --> 13:39.068
Oh, by the way, I never called
my diary 'diary' for some reason.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.653
I always gave it a name.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.882
I think I thought it would make
me feel like I had friends.

13:43.943 --> 13:45.277
So here we go.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.993
'Dear Marsha.'

13:48.077 --> 13:51.747
Sorry I haven't written in a while,
but I have been very busy.

13:52.039 --> 13:53.749
Here are all the things
I have been doing.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.918
One, went to church.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.128
Two, started sixth grade.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.840
Three, got lots of
new Beanie Babies.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.759
'Four, lost my Tamagotchi.'

14:04.760 --> 14:06.804
'Five, practised miming.'

14:07.805 --> 14:09.447
Now, this sounds like a joke,

14:09.508 --> 14:12.895
but I legit took mime
classes as a kid.

14:12.956 --> 14:14.040
Uh, I have proof.

14:14.395 --> 14:15.595
This is me...

14:16.564 --> 14:17.982
as a child mime.

14:18.361 --> 14:19.487
Um, I was home-schooled.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.674
Okay, moving on.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.760
So five was 'practised miming.'

14:22.821 --> 14:25.845
-And then, 'Six, my cat ran away.'
-Aww.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.658
'Seven, found my cat.

14:27.741 --> 14:28.707
It's dead.'

14:28.768 --> 14:29.977
Aww.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.579
'I have been doing a
lot more stuff, too,

14:35.640 --> 14:37.710
but I'm tired and
can't write anymore.'

14:37.793 --> 14:39.286
I most likely will only write

14:39.347 --> 14:41.448
when I'm having
problems, or puberty,

14:41.589 --> 14:45.175
or I'm just bored from now on,
so don't expect many letters.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.052
'Good night. Love, Colleen.'

14:48.929 --> 14:49.710
Well...

14:53.517 --> 14:55.362
You guys are cheering
'cause you think it's over.

14:55.423 --> 14:57.550
I'm sorry, it's not.
There's more.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.941
So, uh, I did write when
I went through puberty.

15:01.025 --> 15:04.194
So I want to show you one of my
favourite pages from that time.

15:05.738 --> 15:09.783
'Personal note. My boobs are popping
out and they are killing me.'

15:10.367 --> 15:13.745
And I drew a picture in case anyone
wants to know what that looks like.

15:16.009 --> 15:16.892
It hurts.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.337
So puberty did not do me well.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.423
I had a really hard time during
puberty, as most kids do.

15:24.506 --> 15:27.009
And you will see that
reflected on this next page.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.451
'Hate, hate, hate,
hate, hate, hate, hate,

15:32.512 --> 15:34.391
hate, hate, hate
times a million.'

15:34.475 --> 15:36.727
This is my feelings
towards life.

15:36.810 --> 15:39.813
'Lava lamps are really cool...
Colleen Ballinger.'

15:41.231 --> 15:41.983
So...

15:44.193 --> 15:47.738
Now, when I was looking for pages
to read to you guys tonight,

15:47.821 --> 15:52.576
um, I found this one page in my
diary that is so embarrassing,

15:52.660 --> 15:54.620
so mortifying,

15:54.703 --> 15:57.206
that I could not
possibly read it myself.

15:57.289 --> 15:58.457
That's how bad it is.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.961
So I'm going to have the help
of my best friend, Kory DeSoto...

16:02.044 --> 16:04.254
to come read this to you.

16:05.700 --> 16:06.952
This is Kory.

16:12.888 --> 16:13.888
Kory.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.602
They love Kory!

16:18.769 --> 16:19.895
I do, too.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.981
He's the best.

16:23.315 --> 16:24.525
So Kory...

16:25.025 --> 16:28.362
is my best friend, and he has
been for many, many years.

16:28.445 --> 16:30.614
Now, Kory and I
met doing theatre,

16:30.698 --> 16:35.953
and we have a strange obsession
with bad theatre and bad acting.

16:36.036 --> 16:40.249
So I have requested that he
read the worst page of my diary

16:40.332 --> 16:44.211
as a bad-acted monologue
for you guys tonight, so...

16:44.753 --> 16:46.714
Oh, by the way, before
he gets started,

16:46.797 --> 16:49.383
I just want to let you know
that this is no ordinary journal.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.635
This is my prayer journal.

16:52.543 --> 16:54.795
So these are my thoughts to God.

16:54.885 --> 16:55.886
Keep that in mind.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.560
Scene.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.898
'Precious Daddy...'

17:07.608 --> 17:10.377
'I need you to provide me'

17:10.438 --> 17:13.107
with a lot of patience right now

17:13.323 --> 17:18.369
because I keep on getting these
dirty looks from this girl...

17:18.829 --> 17:20.247
'Taryn.'

17:21.665 --> 17:25.836
'At the last prayer circle, she asked
for us to pray for her grandma.'

17:26.252 --> 17:29.979
But if she keeps on giving
me these dirty looks,

17:30.226 --> 17:33.730
'I am not gonna pray for her.'

17:42.352 --> 17:45.230
'Sorry. Satan got a hold of me there...'

17:58.577 --> 17:59.620
Oh...

18:00.954 --> 18:02.790
'Anyways...'

18:03.071 --> 18:06.449
in other news, let's
talk about boys...

18:06.627 --> 18:08.712
or lack thereof.

18:09.379 --> 18:11.590
Am I a mutant or something?

18:11.673 --> 18:14.301
Why can't I get a boyfriend?

18:16.220 --> 18:17.471
'Good times...'

18:19.098 --> 18:20.252
'Not really.'

18:21.934 --> 18:22.770
'Amen.'

18:26.663 --> 18:29.583
Give it up for Kory
DeSoto, everybody!

18:32.019 --> 18:33.019
Okay.

18:34.071 --> 18:34.775
Now,

18:35.165 --> 18:37.491
I could keep reading to you

18:37.574 --> 18:40.410
from my emo high school
and junior high diaries,

18:40.494 --> 18:44.289
or I could read to you from
my favourite childhood diary,

18:44.373 --> 18:46.667
which is the poop diary.

18:47.709 --> 18:51.255
Unfortunately, this is
exactly what it sounds like.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.507
My mother, she has four kids,

18:53.590 --> 18:55.252
and she was trying
to figure out a way

18:55.367 --> 18:57.816
to get closer to
us, to bond with us.

18:57.877 --> 19:00.831
Um, she wanted us to open up
to her more about our feelings.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.406
So she came up with
this brilliant idea.

19:03.467 --> 19:06.562
'I know. I'll put a diary
next to the toilet,'

19:06.645 --> 19:09.022
and that way, whenever
they're doing that,

19:09.106 --> 19:11.130
'they can write to me
about their feelings.'

19:11.400 --> 19:13.652
She thought this
would help us to bond.

19:13.735 --> 19:16.071
Now, obviously, this
wasn't the greatest idea,

19:16.132 --> 19:18.425
and I have proof, because I'm
going to read you some pages

19:18.532 --> 19:20.033
from the poop diary.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.912
So these are conversations
between me and my mother, okay?

19:24.246 --> 19:26.748
So the first page here,
it starts with my mother.

19:26.832 --> 19:27.875
She asks me...

19:28.292 --> 19:29.769
'How is choir going?'

19:30.377 --> 19:31.377
And I said...

19:31.837 --> 19:34.715
'Fine. I have diariah again!'

19:36.049 --> 19:38.051
'Every time I eat
cheese, I have...'

19:38.135 --> 19:40.335
Arrow to 'diariah.'

19:42.139 --> 19:43.109
So...

19:46.852 --> 19:50.230
My mom's great idea
wasn't really working.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.024
Um, but she didn't
give up, my mother.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.318
She knew this poop
diary would work,

19:54.401 --> 19:55.569
so she tried again.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.477
And I'm gonna read
to you another page.

19:57.538 --> 19:59.198
This one actually
starts with me.

19:59.281 --> 20:00.281
I said...

20:00.866 --> 20:03.076
'That turkey stuff you
made for your diet dinner

20:03.160 --> 20:05.287
smelled better than it taste.'

20:05.871 --> 20:06.997
And then she said,

20:07.331 --> 20:08.874
'Yes, it did.'

20:10.626 --> 20:11.626
And I said,

20:11.919 --> 20:14.463
'I have diariah!'

20:16.965 --> 20:17.838
So...

20:18.203 --> 20:19.548
it was a good attempt
from my mother,

20:19.609 --> 20:21.970
but obviously, the
poop diary backfired.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.496
But you know what? Actually, my
mom and I are really close now,

20:24.556 --> 20:27.643
so maybe it worked. Moms, try
out poop diaries with your kids.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.562
By the way, I thought
this was a normal thing

20:30.646 --> 20:32.439
that everyone had in their homes

20:32.522 --> 20:35.067
until I was about 16 years old.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.581
So that was an
embarrassing conversation

20:37.642 --> 20:39.112
to have with my
friends in high school

20:39.196 --> 20:41.595
and be like, 'Uh,
where's your poop diary?'

20:43.867 --> 20:44.743
Ah.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.495
Anyway, let me get rid of this.

20:46.578 --> 20:47.389
So...

20:47.829 --> 20:48.664
listen up.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.083
I know why you guys
are here, all right?

20:51.166 --> 20:54.044
So who's excited to
see Miranda Sings?

21:01.301 --> 21:02.301
All righty.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.180
Let's see if she's ready.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.266
She's not, so I'm
gonna do another song.

21:08.267 --> 21:12.145
But maybe if I sing this,
Miranda will come out to play.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.940
Now, I am a musical
theatre dork.

21:15.023 --> 21:18.235
My background is in theatre.
I love theatre.

21:18.310 --> 21:21.052
And so when I first started
doing Miranda ten years ago,

21:21.113 --> 21:23.573
my entire show was
just Broadway songs.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.447
So I would like
to pay my respects

21:25.508 --> 21:27.290
to the beginning
of Miranda Sings

21:27.452 --> 21:30.622
and sing a theatre song for you
guys right now, if that's cool.

21:34.716 --> 21:38.470
Perhaps if I sing this,
Miranda will come out to play.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.860
This is 'Defying Gravity.'

21:49.766 --> 21:53.687
# Something has changed within me #

21:54.104 --> 21:57.316
# Something is not the same #

21:57.858 --> 22:02.112
# I'm through with playing by the rules #

22:02.195 --> 22:06.033
# Of someone else's game #

22:06.366 --> 22:09.619
# Too late for second guessing #

22:09.953 --> 22:14.791
# Too late to go back to sleep #

22:14.875 --> 22:17.919
# It's time to trust my instincts #

22:18.503 --> 22:24.134
# Close my eyes and leap #

22:24.217 --> 22:30.057
# It's time to try defying gravity #

22:30.140 --> 22:35.604
# I think I'll try defying gravity #

22:35.687 --> 22:38.273
# And you can't pull me down... #

22:59.378 --> 23:02.672
# So if you care to find me #

23:02.756 --> 23:05.842
# Look to the western sky #

23:05.926 --> 23:08.428
# For those who told me lately #

23:08.512 --> 23:13.600
# Everyone deserves a chance to fly #

23:13.683 --> 23:15.977
# And if I'm flying solo #

23:16.061 --> 23:18.939
# At least I'm flying free #

23:19.022 --> 23:20.941
# To those who'd ground me #

23:21.233 --> 23:24.903
# Take a message back from me #

23:24.986 --> 23:30.534
# Tell them how I am defying gravity #

23:31.034 --> 23:33.078
# I'm flying high #

23:33.161 --> 23:36.039
# I'm defying gravity #

23:36.123 --> 23:40.502
# And soon I'll match them in renown #

23:41.837 --> 23:45.257
# And nobody in all of Oz #

23:45.674 --> 23:48.802
# No wizard that there is or was #

23:48.885 --> 23:54.141
# Is ever going to bring me #

23:54.224 --> 23:57.853
# Down #

24:01.189 --> 24:05.485
# Bring me down #

24:09.990 --> 24:16.955
# Oh, whoa! #

24:34.639 --> 24:36.600
Hey, guys. It's me, Miranda.

24:41.167 --> 24:44.211
I'm so excited to be here
at the Kennedy Centre tonight.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.734
Are you guys excited?

24:47.402 --> 24:48.528
You'd better be excited

24:48.612 --> 24:50.714
'cause you're here to see
the most miraculous,

24:50.775 --> 24:53.488
amazing person in
the entire world,

24:53.571 --> 24:55.315
Miranda Sings!

24:58.955 --> 25:00.207
It's true.

25:00.290 --> 25:02.792
I'm the most
incredible person ever.

25:02.876 --> 25:07.047
I'm a famous singer, dancer,
actor, model, magician,

25:07.130 --> 25:08.757
other things...

25:10.050 --> 25:12.969
But you guys are in
for a treat tonight

25:13.053 --> 25:16.264
'cause not only do I do all
of those amazing things...

25:16.348 --> 25:19.684
Oh, no. That stuff doesn't
even matter anymore.

25:20.143 --> 25:22.687
You guys are in the
presence of greatness

25:22.771 --> 25:26.358
because tonight,
standing before you

25:26.441 --> 25:28.193
is the very next

25:28.276 --> 25:30.320
Virgin Mary!

25:37.593 --> 25:40.430
It's true. I am with child.

25:41.248 --> 25:44.417
I am expecting a little
brat pretty soon.

25:44.751 --> 25:47.585
Now, obviously, I would
never do the nasty,

25:47.646 --> 25:49.982
which means I am the
next Virgin Mary.

25:50.173 --> 25:52.217
But I have some
sceptics out there.

25:52.300 --> 25:55.762
Some people don't think
I'm actually the next Virgin Mary.

25:55.845 --> 25:57.347
Well, I'm about to prove it to you.

25:57.430 --> 25:59.808
You are in the presence
of freaking greatness.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.476
Watch this.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.560
Hit it!

26:24.125 --> 26:26.293
# Halle... # Oh, shoot.

26:26.376 --> 26:27.794
# Hallelujah #

26:28.128 --> 26:30.005
# Hallelujah, hallelujah #

26:30.088 --> 26:32.132
# Hallelujah #

26:40.890 --> 26:42.726
# Look at me, I'm a pregnant queen #

26:42.809 --> 26:44.436
# Baby's coming soon, my poor tookie #

26:44.519 --> 26:46.503
# But it probably won't hurt
because God chose me #

26:46.563 --> 26:48.773
# To be the next Holy Virgin Mary #

26:48.857 --> 26:51.276
# Well, you don't think
I'm the next Virgin Mary? #

26:51.359 --> 26:54.195
# A lot of magical things
Have been happening to me lately #

26:54.279 --> 26:55.947
# To prove I'm the chosen one #

26:56.531 --> 26:58.408
# Currently have two brains in me #

26:58.491 --> 27:00.244
# So I'm double smarter than everybody #

27:00.305 --> 27:02.182
# When I sneeze, I pee simultaneously #

27:02.243 --> 27:03.934
# I don't need a table
I just use my belly #

27:04.019 --> 27:05.980
# Haven't pooped in weeks
And I'm still alive #

27:06.124 --> 27:07.899
# Got a tiny little penis in me
At all times #

27:07.959 --> 27:09.919
# I see everything, I've got four eyes #

27:10.003 --> 27:12.505
# And my booty's looking thick
'Cause I've got four thighs #

27:15.800 --> 27:17.710
# Do the waddle, do the waddle #

27:17.771 --> 27:19.315
# Do the waddle, do the waddle #

27:19.679 --> 27:21.288
# Before he comes out
He needs to repent #

27:21.348 --> 27:23.331
# He's kicking and grabbing me
Without my consent #

27:23.391 --> 27:25.417
# Stop grabbing my tookie
Or I'll make you pay rent #

27:25.477 --> 27:28.063
# If he keeps it up
He could become the next president #

27:35.487 --> 27:38.323
# Virgin Miranda #

27:38.907 --> 27:44.162
# The holiest of all #

27:53.113 --> 27:55.574
See, just proved it.

27:56.549 --> 28:00.637
I am the next Virgin
Holy Miranda, all right?

28:00.970 --> 28:03.339
Now, when I announced
this on the internet,

28:03.515 --> 28:06.768
I had a lot of people
being very offended

28:06.829 --> 28:08.937
that I said I was
the next Virgin Mary.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.230
Which is ridiculous!

28:10.313 --> 28:11.439
Look at these comments.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.067
People are saying things
like, 'I'm affended.'

28:14.776 --> 28:16.778
'This video offiended me.'

28:17.570 --> 28:19.406
'Ew, Ur preginanit.'

28:20.782 --> 28:21.866
But you know what?

28:22.492 --> 28:25.453
I realized people
are gonna be offended

28:25.537 --> 28:28.039
whether I'm preginanit or not.

28:28.623 --> 28:32.652
Because everybody is offended
by everything these days.

28:32.713 --> 28:34.173
It's ridiculous!

28:36.416 --> 28:38.779
You can't do anything
without offending someone.

28:38.840 --> 28:40.217
It's so annoying.

28:40.343 --> 28:42.424
Like, I can't even post
an Instagram picture

28:42.485 --> 28:44.097
without ticking someone off.

28:44.180 --> 28:45.180
Look at these, okay.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.851
This picture
offended the vegans.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.353
This picture
offended the mothers.

28:50.698 --> 28:53.420
This picture offended... everyone.

28:55.066 --> 28:56.568
So friggin' annoying.

28:57.444 --> 29:00.530
But then I realized something.
I was doing it all wrong.

29:00.613 --> 29:02.951
Because you can actually
say whatever you want

29:03.012 --> 29:04.868
and do whatever you want

29:04.951 --> 29:06.536
and not get in trouble for it,

29:06.619 --> 29:09.038
as long as you say
two little words.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.498
No offence!

29:10.582 --> 29:12.584
That's right. 'No offence.'

29:12.667 --> 29:14.544
Hit it!

29:14.627 --> 29:18.006
Listen up, leotards. I'm about
to teach you two magic words

29:18.089 --> 29:19.696
that make it so you can
say whatever you want,

29:19.757 --> 29:22.649
whenever you want,
and not suffer consequences.

29:22.994 --> 29:26.164
# Feel like you're offending everyone
These days? #

29:26.688 --> 29:30.483
# Feel like you're losing friends
No matter what you say? #

29:31.144 --> 29:35.023
# There's a way to say offensive things
And not look bad #

29:35.106 --> 29:39.319
# Just say these two little words
And no one's allowed to be mad #

29:39.652 --> 29:42.197
# I hope you get a paper cut #

29:42.405 --> 29:44.032
# No offence #

29:44.093 --> 29:46.304
# Even your grandma thinks you suck #

29:46.743 --> 29:48.328
# No offence #

29:48.411 --> 29:50.914
# Your face looks exactly like your butt #

29:50.997 --> 29:52.582
# No offence #

29:52.665 --> 29:55.168
# I bet Comic Sans is your favourite font #

29:55.251 --> 29:57.003
# No offence #

30:02.634 --> 30:04.969
See, that's all you gotta say.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.143
In a normal situation,

30:06.204 --> 30:07.847
you go up to someone
and say, 'You're ugly.'

30:07.931 --> 30:08.973
That's really rude.

30:09.057 --> 30:12.352
But if you just finish it off
with, 'You're ugly. No offence,'

30:12.435 --> 30:13.645
they can't get mad.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.559
See? Now,

30:16.062 --> 30:18.867
some of my haters have
yet to learn this lesson.

30:18.928 --> 30:20.756
They're saying very rude,
offensive things to me

30:20.817 --> 30:24.364
and not saying, 'No offence,'
which is really titting me off,

30:24.656 --> 30:27.033
and I'm gonna show you right
now what I'm talking about.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.637
People are telling
me that I did porn

30:29.869 --> 30:31.538
in order to get pregnant.

30:31.996 --> 30:33.243
Which is not true.

30:33.414 --> 30:35.375
I would never
participate in the nasty.

30:35.458 --> 30:36.649
Now, I need to prove it to you

30:36.709 --> 30:40.171
so I can prove that I'm
actually the next Virgin Mary.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.549
So I'm gonna prove I would
never participate in a porn.

30:42.610 --> 30:43.948
Now, what you might not know

30:44.009 --> 30:47.345
is that porn is
happening all around you.

30:47.428 --> 30:51.266
Even right now, there are people
being porn in this very room,

30:51.349 --> 30:52.767
and I cannot have that.

30:53.101 --> 30:56.020
So I'm going to need two
volunteers right now.

30:57.647 --> 30:58.647
Hmm.

30:59.196 --> 31:00.155
Let's see here.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.360
Um, how about you right
here in the red pants?

31:02.443 --> 31:03.443
I need one more.

31:04.973 --> 31:06.114
There's a lot of you.

31:06.197 --> 31:09.033
Um, how about in the skirt, right here?
Yeah, in the skirt.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.117
Come on up.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.120
Hello.

31:12.512 --> 31:14.096
-What's your name?
-Calita.

31:14.307 --> 31:15.850
Calita!

31:16.207 --> 31:17.767
Wow, do you have a dragon?

31:17.828 --> 31:20.396
Is that you, the
Mother of the Dragons?

31:20.846 --> 31:21.847
No.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.817
I got you confused
with someone else.

31:25.174 --> 31:26.134
So anyways...

31:26.317 --> 31:27.317
Hi. Okay.

31:27.722 --> 31:28.722
So...

31:29.345 --> 31:32.202
Listen, in order to talk
about this first type of porn,

31:32.263 --> 31:33.807
I'm gonna need my pointer.

31:33.868 --> 31:36.412
I really want to make sure you
guys are paying attention, okay?

31:36.603 --> 31:38.354
So just give me a second.

31:39.606 --> 31:40.606
Okay.

31:42.418 --> 31:43.418
Listen up.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.577
Calita over here

31:45.820 --> 31:49.519
is wearing a nice button-up shirt
all the way to the tippity top,

31:49.741 --> 31:51.534
nice long sleeves,

31:51.618 --> 31:54.287
pants that go all the
way down to the floor.

31:54.370 --> 31:57.905
This is very nice.
Very conservative.

31:57.966 --> 32:01.720
This is a perfect example of not porn.

32:02.587 --> 32:03.713
This...

32:05.618 --> 32:07.369
is porn, okay?

32:07.467 --> 32:10.053
Her skirt is so short,

32:10.136 --> 32:12.847
all it will take is one
really big gust of wind

32:12.931 --> 32:15.558
and we'll see all the
creases and crevices.

32:15.934 --> 32:19.729
And the top goes so low we can
the entire chesticle crack.

32:19.979 --> 32:22.607
This is a perfect
example of porn.

32:22.690 --> 32:24.233
-So what's your name?
-Sarah.

32:24.623 --> 32:25.739
Exactly.

32:27.616 --> 32:28.555
No offence.

32:30.907 --> 32:33.743
So here we have porn, not porn.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.453
Porn, not porn.

32:35.744 --> 32:37.664
Do not fret, Sarah. I'mma help you out.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.082
I know you're a Mirfanda.

32:39.165 --> 32:43.169
However, give Calita
a round of applause.

32:44.712 --> 32:45.588
Thank you.

32:45.672 --> 32:46.672
Go away.

32:47.006 --> 32:48.216
Get off. Okay.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.259
Come here, Sarah.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.220
Oh, this is bad news.

32:52.545 --> 32:57.508
Listen, you are in the presence
of a biblical holy figure, okay?

32:57.725 --> 33:00.937
I cannot have my Mirfandas
walking around dressed porn-y,

33:01.020 --> 33:02.313
so I gotta fix this.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.399
Lucky for you, I brought
something with me tonight

33:04.482 --> 33:06.484
in case there was a Sarah here.

33:07.235 --> 33:09.988
I use this whenever I see
someone looking porn-ish.

33:10.071 --> 33:10.783
Okay?

33:10.844 --> 33:13.888
This is the stretchy
solution to porn.

33:14.033 --> 33:16.953
So what you do is, whenever
you see someone dressed porn,

33:17.036 --> 33:18.458
you just put this
on their head...

33:20.183 --> 33:21.183
and then you just...

33:23.167 --> 33:24.877
Like this. See?

33:25.545 --> 33:26.796
Very nice.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.339
However...

33:29.841 --> 33:32.719
she is such a severe
case of the porn.

33:32.802 --> 33:33.886
Turn around.

33:34.554 --> 33:37.386
This is so tight, we can see the
entire shape of the badonkadonk.

33:37.447 --> 33:38.828
Inappropriate!

33:39.392 --> 33:41.458
Which means this needs
to go, all right?

33:41.519 --> 33:43.062
This is never going to work.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.197
There is only one
thing that we can do

33:45.460 --> 33:48.026
for someone who is
this porn-y, okay?

33:48.109 --> 33:50.611
This I only do in severe cases,

33:50.695 --> 33:51.821
so please,

33:51.904 --> 33:52.904
help me...

33:53.573 --> 33:55.324
and pray for Sarah.

33:55.589 --> 33:56.784
Okay?

33:56.974 --> 33:58.338
Thank you, Sarah.

33:58.786 --> 34:00.079
Thank you. Goodbye.

34:04.625 --> 34:06.919
Okay. Listen, I can't have that.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.880
I can't have my Mirfandas
dressing porn-y, okay?

34:09.964 --> 34:11.257
You represent me now.

34:11.340 --> 34:14.092
So everybody, look to your
left, look to your right,

34:14.177 --> 34:16.304
see if anybody's dressed
porn-y right now.

34:16.387 --> 34:18.598
Put a hand on them
and pray for them.

34:18.681 --> 34:21.768
Let's get rid of the porn
together, one prayer at a time.

34:22.935 --> 34:24.520
Very good, yes.

34:24.937 --> 34:27.899
Very nice. Oh, this girl's praying
for her mom in the front row.

34:29.734 --> 34:30.734
What the heck?

34:31.069 --> 34:33.446
The mom's all happy.
She's like, 'I am porn.'

34:35.666 --> 34:36.666
Okay.

34:38.159 --> 34:41.788
Now, listen, I wish that was the
only type of porn that there is,

34:41.871 --> 34:43.831
but there's lots
of types of porn.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.208
And this next type of porn
is the most common

34:46.292 --> 34:47.877
and the worst one of all.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.061
It's porn-style dancing.

34:50.121 --> 34:51.589
I know you kids.

34:51.672 --> 34:54.842
You like to go out to
da club and bust a move.

34:55.217 --> 34:58.054
But I don't want to see you doing
any of these nasty booty shakes

34:58.137 --> 34:59.362
and booty twerks.

34:59.423 --> 35:01.258
It's disgusting
and inappropriate.

35:01.327 --> 35:04.205
The only type of dancing
my Mirfandas should be doing

35:04.368 --> 35:05.828
is my type of dancing.

35:05.978 --> 35:08.231
So if you know it,
I want to see you do it.

35:08.314 --> 35:09.983
This is 'Do The Miranda!'

35:10.044 --> 35:11.651
Hit it!

35:11.816 --> 35:15.071
All right, Miranda
Sings in the house!

35:15.154 --> 35:16.280
Get up out of your seats.

35:16.364 --> 35:19.037
I want to see you dancing
right now, having a good time.

35:19.534 --> 35:20.910
All right. Here we go.

35:20.993 --> 35:23.363
# Hey, you over there
With the porn-y hair #

35:23.538 --> 35:25.248
# I got what you need #

35:25.623 --> 35:28.084
# Hey, you there, bro
With the camel toe #

35:28.167 --> 35:30.253
# Come and just follow my lead #

35:30.336 --> 35:32.800
# A new dance is here
And I fear, my dear #

35:33.005 --> 35:34.828
# That you're all looking like hoes #

35:34.889 --> 35:37.642
# So cover your backs
And your chesticle cracks #

35:37.844 --> 35:39.720
# 'Cause here is how it goes #

35:40.021 --> 35:42.329
# Lift your legs up high
Poke your neighbour in the eye #

35:42.390 --> 35:44.725
# Paint a rainbow in the sky
Wipe it till it's dry #

35:44.809 --> 35:47.186
# Then twerk like me
But don't make it slutty #

35:47.270 --> 35:49.647
# It's as easy as can be, so follow me #

35:57.989 --> 35:59.365
# Let's do it again #

35:59.782 --> 36:01.615
# Do the Miranda #

36:02.285 --> 36:04.120
# Oh, yeah #

36:04.203 --> 36:06.289
# Do the Miranda #

36:08.499 --> 36:10.209
# Do the Miranda! #

36:14.714 --> 36:16.507
Very nice.

36:17.633 --> 36:20.678
I see lots of you know
how to do the Miranda.

36:20.761 --> 36:21.846
Very good.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.098
I saw some of you
not participating.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.266
Mothers.

36:27.018 --> 36:30.062
So congratulations.
You will never get a boyfriend.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.155
No offence.

36:33.107 --> 36:34.483
Okay, listen.

36:37.621 --> 36:39.539
We have a lot to
discuss tonight.

36:39.847 --> 36:42.349
I can't spend this much
time on freaking porn,

36:42.450 --> 36:44.994
so we got to move on
to the next thing, okay?

36:45.177 --> 36:48.581
Because, listen, there's one
thing that the Virgin Mary had

36:48.664 --> 36:49.790
that I don't have yet.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.626
This is a problem, okay?

36:51.709 --> 36:53.294
She had a Joseph.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.255
I don't have a Joseph
yet to my Mary.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.216
So I got a question for you.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.718
Where my baes at?

37:04.138 --> 37:05.932
# I'm about to break it down #

37:06.390 --> 37:07.808
# Sing along if you know it #

37:08.643 --> 37:09.727
# All right, here we go #

37:09.810 --> 37:12.104
# Every time I look around
All I ever see #

37:12.188 --> 37:14.440
# Is people being jealous
And they wanna look like me #

37:14.523 --> 37:16.692
# I've got Tyler, Ricky, Joey
And the Dolan twins too #

37:16.776 --> 37:18.945
# My uncle and Lohanthony
But I'm my favourite boo #

37:19.028 --> 37:20.947
# Got a lot more
But I forgot who they are #

37:21.030 --> 37:23.324
# Sorry, not sorry
Just a superstar #

37:23.407 --> 37:25.660
# Got lots of baes
Are you wondering how I do? #

37:25.743 --> 37:27.703
# Take a little listen
I'll find a bae for you #

37:27.787 --> 37:30.081
# Hey, where my baes at? #

37:30.706 --> 37:32.416
# Where my baes at? #

37:32.500 --> 37:34.543
# I got so many baes, man #

37:34.627 --> 37:36.796
# I'll teach you how to get one too #

37:36.879 --> 37:39.173
# Where my baes at in the house? #

37:41.918 --> 37:44.712
Whoa, so many baes.

37:45.054 --> 37:46.097
You know what, guys?

37:46.780 --> 37:48.032
I'm not joking around.

37:48.516 --> 37:50.393
I really need to find a bae.

37:50.476 --> 37:52.520
I am six months
pregnant already,

37:52.853 --> 37:55.648
so I need to find a
daddy to this kid.

38:22.425 --> 38:23.509
Love you, Patrick!

38:23.592 --> 38:24.760
Hi, Patrick.

38:25.845 --> 38:26.971
Hey, Miranda.

38:31.151 --> 38:33.205
Patrick, what are you doing here?

38:33.266 --> 38:35.813
I haven't seen you
in, like, six months.

38:39.650 --> 38:40.985
Uh... Well, I...

38:41.330 --> 38:42.539
I heard the, um...

38:43.654 --> 38:44.822
That you, uh...

38:44.905 --> 38:47.033
That you're with
child, and, um...

38:47.737 --> 38:50.865
I thought maybe you could
use some protection.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.582
Patrick...

38:56.207 --> 38:57.917
It's a little late for that.

39:00.254 --> 39:03.716
Besides, we can't be together.
You know this.

39:03.855 --> 39:06.760
Netflix owns the rights to you,
and the show got cancelled.

39:06.821 --> 39:08.322
I could get sued.

39:08.929 --> 39:10.621
So you need to go.
I don't want to get sued.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.016
I don't have insurance.

39:12.266 --> 39:13.559
Go away. Hurry.

39:13.989 --> 39:16.992
Before anyone sees. Yes.
Please go, Patrick, please.

39:20.399 --> 39:23.611
Oh, don't give me that.
I didn't cancel the show!

39:37.041 --> 39:39.752
Just kidding. I'm grateful
for the experience.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.923
I love Netflix so much.

39:44.423 --> 39:45.588
You know, I can't eat this.

39:45.649 --> 39:47.510
It makes the baby
kick me in my tookie,

39:47.593 --> 39:48.719
so does anyone want it?

39:50.388 --> 39:51.538
What about in the balcony?

39:51.599 --> 39:52.655
Do you want it up there?

39:53.153 --> 39:53.968
Get ready.

39:58.020 --> 39:59.522
That was for you.

40:00.481 --> 40:02.316
Now, listen, okay.
I wasn't kidding.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.973
Before I was rudely
interrupted by Patrick,

40:05.194 --> 40:07.696
I really do have a surprise
for you guys tonight.

40:07.780 --> 40:11.033
We all know I need to get
a daddy to this baby ASAP,

40:11.117 --> 40:14.120
so I called up my number-one bae

40:14.203 --> 40:16.789
and said I was doing
a very special show tonight

40:16.872 --> 40:19.291
in Washington DC at
the Kennedy Centre.

40:19.375 --> 40:22.878
This guy has millions
of subscribers,

40:22.962 --> 40:24.672
millions of views,

40:24.755 --> 40:26.173
very, very famous.

40:26.257 --> 40:28.592
My number-one bae.
Do you know who it is?

40:30.845 --> 40:34.890
Joey Graceffa!

40:37.351 --> 40:39.226
But he said he
couldn't come, so...

40:40.563 --> 40:42.606
That would have been
great, though, huh,

40:42.690 --> 40:43.858
if he was here.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.862
The parents are all
laughing at their kids.

40:48.554 --> 40:50.556
They're crying.

40:51.157 --> 40:53.951
You know what?
He's not here, but you guys are.

40:54.034 --> 40:56.328
Who wants to be my bae tonight?

40:58.288 --> 41:00.124
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:00.185 --> 41:01.459
Stop. Are you kidding me?

41:01.542 --> 41:03.335
I see so many girls
raising their hands.

41:03.419 --> 41:05.004
I'm not a Lebanese.

41:05.087 --> 41:07.423
Boys, please. No offence.

41:08.507 --> 41:09.467
Let's see here.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.760
We got lots of options. Ooh.

41:11.844 --> 41:14.513
How about in the white
sweatshirt up there?

41:14.597 --> 41:15.806
I need two more.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.308
Two more.

41:17.641 --> 41:19.435
Who do we got? Who do we got?

41:19.894 --> 41:21.437
Okay, in the black hat.

41:21.770 --> 41:22.605
I need one more.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.857
Come on up, white
sweatshirt, black hat.

41:24.940 --> 41:26.275
One more.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.152
So many good options.

41:28.777 --> 41:31.113
Okay, how about in the
purple shirt right here?

41:32.025 --> 41:33.025
Come on up.

41:33.866 --> 41:36.202
Ooh, hello.

41:36.994 --> 41:40.372
Look at this sexy bae.

41:40.873 --> 41:42.875
What is your name?

41:42.958 --> 41:43.713
Nathan.

41:43.876 --> 41:45.878
Nathan. Love that.

41:45.961 --> 41:47.796
I love your face hairs.

41:48.839 --> 41:50.007
Where are you from?

41:50.299 --> 41:51.425
Barrie, Ontario.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.469
Barrie, Ontario?

41:53.886 --> 41:56.096
Oh. Sounds like an infection.

41:57.865 --> 41:59.908
Oh, hey, Daddy.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.505
What's your name?

42:01.566 --> 42:02.561
My name is Anthony.

42:02.645 --> 42:04.146
-Andronen? What?
-Anthony.

42:04.230 --> 42:05.032
Anthony!

42:05.093 --> 42:05.718
Okay.

42:05.864 --> 42:07.777
You did not say that the first time.
Just saying.

42:08.484 --> 42:09.777
Anthony, where are you from?

42:09.860 --> 42:12.696
I'm from Bayonne, New Jersey. 'Bay.'

42:12.780 --> 42:14.036
-Bayonne. I'm the bae.
-Ooh.

42:14.097 --> 42:15.138
I get it.

42:16.021 --> 42:16.689
Whatever.

42:17.743 --> 42:19.060
Good talk. Okay.

42:19.453 --> 42:22.873
Oh, hey. You're much
shorter up close.

42:23.415 --> 42:24.415
Um, what's your name?

42:24.625 --> 42:25.751
Aldair.

42:28.671 --> 42:31.799
Are you related to Andrew
over there, All-dayer?

42:32.466 --> 42:33.551
Yeah.

42:34.134 --> 42:36.303
'Sure. That works.' Aldair.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.264
I love it. It's
like, 'All-dayer!'

42:39.473 --> 42:41.392
'I could do an all-dayer!'

42:44.562 --> 42:45.980
Good. Okay.

42:47.481 --> 42:48.257
Cool.

42:49.441 --> 42:51.527
Um, where are you from, Aldair?

42:51.610 --> 42:53.070
My mom's belly.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.248
What do you do for a living?

43:04.999 --> 43:06.584
Uh...

43:06.667 --> 43:08.544
watch you on YouTube.

43:11.130 --> 43:14.049
We have a flirt in
the house tonight.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.218
Okay, Aldair.

43:17.781 --> 43:18.907
Love that.

43:19.138 --> 43:22.883
Now, I have three
very sexy men...

43:22.950 --> 43:24.827
boys on stage.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.426
All of them...

43:27.526 --> 43:31.835
are ready and excited to be
the father to this child.

43:36.447 --> 43:40.159
Um, so you can all handle
this responsibility, you think?

43:43.329 --> 43:44.329
Promising.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.278
Okay. Now, here's the deal.

43:46.339 --> 43:48.592
I can't have all three
of them being the daddy,

43:48.753 --> 43:51.172
so I'm gonna pick one,
but how I'm gonna do that

43:51.337 --> 43:52.729
is I'm gonna woo them

43:52.790 --> 43:56.467
with my charms and my talents
and my vocal abilities.

43:56.550 --> 43:58.636
And whoever I have the
most chemistry with

43:58.719 --> 44:01.513
will become the
daddy to this child.

44:01.597 --> 44:04.600
So all you guys have to do
is stay right where you are.

44:04.683 --> 44:06.935
I will come to you,
so just come...

44:07.019 --> 44:08.729
Oh, yes. You can come to me.

44:10.814 --> 44:12.775
I will be doing all of the work.

44:12.858 --> 44:14.860
If the chemistry is
there, it's there.

44:14.943 --> 44:16.945
-All right? Are you ready for it?
-Absolutely.

44:17.029 --> 44:18.280
Hit it!

44:18.947 --> 44:20.843
# What up, everybody? New year, new me #

44:20.904 --> 44:23.323
# You can smell me coming
Like asparagus pee #

44:23.494 --> 44:25.829
# I'm so sexy, I'm just like a zit #

44:25.913 --> 44:28.332
# That's what everybody stares at
And you want to touch it #

44:29.166 --> 44:30.292
# Oh, oh, oh #

44:30.876 --> 44:33.319
# You see me walking by
And you are shook #

44:41.595 --> 44:45.224
# Summer loving, had me a blast #

44:45.473 --> 44:49.102
# Summer loving, happened so fast #

44:49.353 --> 44:52.815
# Met a boy, crazy for me #

44:53.148 --> 44:55.984
# Met a boy, cute as can be #

44:59.446 --> 45:02.074
# Summer dreams #

45:02.408 --> 45:06.537
# Ripped at the seams #

45:07.037 --> 45:08.330
# But #

45:08.872 --> 45:11.041
# Oh #

45:11.750 --> 45:17.256
# Those summer #

45:18.683 --> 45:25.649
# Nights #

45:42.114 --> 45:43.532
Wow.

45:44.158 --> 45:47.161
There is so much chemistry
on stage right now.

45:47.828 --> 45:48.940
Like I said,

45:49.011 --> 45:52.560
I can only pick one bae to
be the daddy to this child,

45:52.708 --> 45:55.669
so I'm gonna get out something
called the bae-ometer.

45:56.086 --> 45:58.922
The bae-ometer also
happens to be my hand.

45:59.006 --> 46:00.326
So I'm just gonna take it,

46:00.387 --> 46:01.592
put it over their head,

46:01.675 --> 46:04.303
and the bae you think
I had the most chemistry with,

46:04.386 --> 46:05.554
cheer for, okay?

46:05.637 --> 46:06.637
So here we go.

46:10.309 --> 46:11.602
Pretty good. Pretty good.

46:17.900 --> 46:19.693
Oh.

46:29.661 --> 46:31.705
This is so awkward. I won.

46:33.582 --> 46:35.899
But give them a round of applause.
They did such a good job.

46:35.959 --> 46:37.961
Call me when you're
older, Aldair.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.880
Thank you. Go away.

46:40.172 --> 46:42.216
You can leave now. Get away.

46:45.344 --> 46:46.762
Well, now I'm single.

46:47.179 --> 46:48.179
So...

46:48.931 --> 46:52.017
Don't worry, guys, okay?
Don't worry.

46:52.100 --> 46:55.534
I can handle the responsibility
of being the mother

46:55.757 --> 46:58.106
and the father to this baby.

46:58.190 --> 46:59.483
Easy-peasy.

46:59.566 --> 47:02.820
I have been preparing for
this moment my entire life.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.863
I was born holy.

47:04.947 --> 47:07.449
Born the holiest of holes.

47:07.533 --> 47:08.492
And I have proof.

47:08.575 --> 47:11.460
I have been acting
like and dressing like

47:11.521 --> 47:14.706
biblical characters
my entire life.

47:14.767 --> 47:16.936
I have pictures from when
I was a wee little tot

47:17.042 --> 47:20.462
dressing like every famous
biblical character there ever was.

47:20.546 --> 47:21.505
Look at this.

47:21.588 --> 47:23.425
Here is me as an angel,

47:23.486 --> 47:25.113
me as Moses,

47:25.174 --> 47:26.759
me as mother Mary,

47:26.923 --> 47:28.508
me, the prostitute.

47:29.189 --> 47:30.042
See?

47:30.347 --> 47:33.669
Every single biblical
character I have played.

47:33.730 --> 47:35.448
Not only that. Look
at this picture.

47:35.531 --> 47:37.265
That's me with the
circle around her.

47:37.326 --> 47:38.893
I'm putting on a
play in the backyard

47:38.954 --> 47:40.274
with some neighbourhood friends.

47:40.357 --> 47:42.067
'What's the play?'
You might ask.

47:42.150 --> 47:45.362
The crucifixion of Jesus Christ.

47:45.563 --> 47:47.614
See, there's the
cross, right up there.

47:47.698 --> 47:50.993
We're about to kill that little boy,
and I am really ticked off.

47:51.661 --> 47:55.183
Not only did I do plays and
act like a biblical character,

47:55.414 --> 47:58.189
but I also always
was very charitable,

47:58.333 --> 48:00.168
and I was very compassionate.

48:00.229 --> 48:02.123
Here, you'll see me
being compassionate,

48:02.184 --> 48:04.548
not only towards
people, but to animals.

48:04.631 --> 48:07.217
Here, I'm playing with my
favourite pet I ever had.

48:07.301 --> 48:09.219
Right there, Charlie the Fly.

48:09.983 --> 48:10.790
Next.

48:11.221 --> 48:13.974
Oh. This is me doing
some charity work.

48:14.057 --> 48:16.935
As you can see, the hardest
charity work there is,

48:17.019 --> 48:19.596
hanging out with a girl
with really ugly bangs.

48:20.136 --> 48:21.064
So...

48:21.148 --> 48:23.984
That was a tough day for me.
Emotional.

48:24.067 --> 48:24.902
Next.

48:24.985 --> 48:26.904
Oh, here's me doing
more charity work.

48:26.987 --> 48:30.449
I'm singing for complete
strangers for free.

48:30.532 --> 48:31.533
Look, they love it.

48:31.617 --> 48:35.120
This guy on this end,
he's like, 'Yaas!'

48:36.538 --> 48:37.748
So... Next.

48:37.831 --> 48:39.598
Oh, this is great
'cause it shows

48:39.659 --> 48:41.877
how everyone has
always adored me,

48:41.960 --> 48:44.149
setting me up for a
life of being adored

48:44.210 --> 48:46.453
by everyone as the
Virgin Miranda.

48:46.514 --> 48:47.890
These boys love me.

48:48.003 --> 48:48.960
They adore me.

48:49.021 --> 48:50.449
They want to be with me so bad,

48:50.510 --> 48:52.971
they can't even keep
their shirts on.

48:53.221 --> 48:55.140
So these are my cousins.

48:56.934 --> 48:59.645
You know, growing up, for me,
was always really easy

48:59.728 --> 49:02.272
'cause I was always the most
popularest girl in school,

49:02.356 --> 49:04.191
president of the drama club,

49:04.274 --> 49:07.194
homecoming queen, prom
king, everything, so...

49:07.277 --> 49:08.779
Being home-schooled is great.

49:09.863 --> 49:14.076
And it really helped prepare me
to become the Virgin Miranda.

49:14.159 --> 49:14.897
But you know what?

49:14.958 --> 49:16.277
I don't want to stand up here

49:16.338 --> 49:18.521
and just brag about
how amazing I am.

49:18.664 --> 49:21.124
I need to show you
how amazing I am.

49:21.208 --> 49:22.778
So how would you
guys like if I did

49:22.839 --> 49:25.397
some charity work
for you tonight?

49:28.674 --> 49:29.925
That's what I thought.

49:30.300 --> 49:34.012
I'm gonna give you the best
gift anyone could ever receive

49:34.096 --> 49:35.681
in the entire world.

49:35.764 --> 49:39.170
I'm going to make all
of you internet famous!

49:40.644 --> 49:42.479
That's what I thought.

49:42.562 --> 49:43.438
Now, listen.

49:43.499 --> 49:45.899
I'm gonna do a
video for you guys,

49:45.983 --> 49:48.402
so say hello to the internet!

49:55.742 --> 49:58.954
# Say hello to the internet #

50:00.998 --> 50:04.084
Hello! We're so famous!

50:07.537 --> 50:09.080
There you go, guys.

50:10.841 --> 50:12.300
Wow!

50:12.384 --> 50:14.886
You guys are gonna get
so famous from that.

50:14.976 --> 50:17.729
Millions of people will see that

50:17.806 --> 50:19.926
if I ever choose to post it.

50:20.892 --> 50:21.852
It's crazy.

50:21.935 --> 50:24.938
Oh, shoot. I just realized something.
Oh, no!

50:25.439 --> 50:27.274
I just made you all
internet famous,

50:27.357 --> 50:30.444
and that means you guys are
all gonna start getting haters.

50:30.527 --> 50:31.403
It's true!

50:31.486 --> 50:34.406
When you get famous on the
internet, you get tons of haters,

50:34.475 --> 50:36.019
so I need to teach
you guys how to deal

50:36.080 --> 50:38.266
with these freaking
bullies online, okay?

50:38.410 --> 50:40.954
Because, listen, you could
be minding your own business

50:41.038 --> 50:42.789
and post an innocent
little video.

50:42.873 --> 50:44.833
Something like this.
Where My Baes At?

50:44.916 --> 50:46.460
A classic music video,

50:46.555 --> 50:49.641
and you could end up
with hate comments like this...

50:50.547 --> 50:53.925
'If she were any more inbred,
she would be a sandwich.'

50:54.968 --> 50:56.094
See what I'm saying?

50:56.178 --> 50:57.940
It doesn't end there.
Look at this one.

50:58.430 --> 51:00.037
'You suck @, go to @.

51:00.098 --> 51:02.642
No one likes you, okay,
so stop singing and @.'

51:02.726 --> 51:05.437
Okay, listen. The worst
part about this hate mail

51:05.520 --> 51:07.276
is not the fact that
they said a bad word,

51:07.337 --> 51:09.274
it's not the fact they
told me to go die,

51:09.357 --> 51:11.568
it's the fact that it
was written by a baby!

51:12.324 --> 51:13.435
Look at that.

51:15.030 --> 51:17.562
You can't trust
babies these days.

51:18.617 --> 51:19.785
Look at this one.

51:20.118 --> 51:22.913
'Ugly piece of @.
I hope you @-ing die.'

51:22.996 --> 51:26.097
Now, Joe Bob responded to
his own comment and he said,

51:26.458 --> 51:28.251
'Subscribe to me, please.'

51:29.586 --> 51:30.587
No, thank you.

51:30.934 --> 51:31.737
See what I'm saying?

51:31.798 --> 51:33.728
You're gonna get hate like
this every single day,

51:33.882 --> 51:36.116
and it doesn't matter what
kind of videos you post online.

51:36.176 --> 51:37.177
They hate on all of them.

51:37.260 --> 51:40.180
Look at this incredible video.
The Slurpee Bath video.

51:40.764 --> 51:42.766
This is quality content, folks.

51:43.809 --> 51:45.498
And I got hate on this.

51:46.394 --> 51:47.687
Look at these comments.

51:48.438 --> 51:52.125
'She looks like the type of girl
who would microwave her hamster.'

51:53.642 --> 51:55.333
That was one time!

51:59.288 --> 51:59.974
Next.

52:00.700 --> 52:03.411
'What the @ you trying to
do to people, dread?'

52:03.495 --> 52:06.098
You in some kind @-ing
mad people home owa?

52:06.206 --> 52:07.833
Lord, have mercy.

52:07.916 --> 52:09.584
Girl, hush your blasty mouth.

52:09.668 --> 52:12.212
Nah. Set-ups. Only squawk,
squawk, squawk, squawk.

52:12.295 --> 52:14.297
'You a @ parrot. Hush.'

52:15.132 --> 52:16.132
Well...

52:16.299 --> 52:18.844
MaddiNawwy is ticked off.

52:19.803 --> 52:20.803
Next.

52:21.138 --> 52:23.223
'You remind me of me. LOL.'

52:23.306 --> 52:25.183
Now, at first, I thought
this was a fan mail

52:25.267 --> 52:27.936
until I realized
it was from Anus!

52:29.229 --> 52:31.439
I don't want to
remind you of an anus.

52:32.149 --> 52:34.568
It's not even the
best part of the butt.

52:35.861 --> 52:38.572
Now, the worst hate
mail I ever even gotted

52:38.648 --> 52:41.920
was on one of my most incredible
music videos of all time,

52:41.981 --> 52:43.076
Shake It Off.

52:43.180 --> 52:44.579
This is a classic.

52:45.871 --> 52:47.372
But I did get hate on it,

52:47.455 --> 52:48.707
and here it is.

52:49.332 --> 52:50.417
'The entire video,

52:50.500 --> 52:54.671
I was wondering how she was
covering her monster size p-word.'

52:55.422 --> 52:56.464
Are you kidding me?

52:56.548 --> 52:57.841
I'm circumcised.

53:00.647 --> 53:01.647
Next.

53:05.640 --> 53:09.186
'Miranda, I'm little Russian boy
and I say you are slut and ugly.'

53:16.109 --> 53:17.235
How rude.

53:17.986 --> 53:18.986
Now, listen.

53:19.404 --> 53:22.240
There is one more hate mail
I have to share with you.

53:22.324 --> 53:24.694
It's the perfect
example of a hater.

53:24.826 --> 53:25.826
Here it is.

53:26.745 --> 53:29.408
'My dad came in, and
I switched to porn

53:29.469 --> 53:31.977
because it was
easier to explain.'

53:35.337 --> 53:37.317
So frigging wrong.

53:38.924 --> 53:41.579
That's the type of hate I
deal with every single day,

53:41.640 --> 53:44.486
and it's the type of hate all of you
guys are gonna have to deal with,

53:44.547 --> 53:45.590
now that you're famous.

53:45.722 --> 53:47.933
But you know what?
I know how to deal with this.

53:48.016 --> 53:50.769
All you've got to do is say,
'Haters, back off.'

53:50.852 --> 53:51.895
Let me hear you say it.

53:51.978 --> 53:54.397
Haters, back off!

53:54.481 --> 53:58.902
Exactly! You say, 'Haters, back off,'
to anyone who's bullying you,

53:58.985 --> 54:00.362
anyone who's hating on you.

54:00.445 --> 54:02.891
Your moms, your pets,
your carpets, your uncles.

54:02.952 --> 54:04.887
I don't care who it is
'cause you know what?

54:04.948 --> 54:07.832
Nobody bullies my Mirfandas,
except for me.

54:09.913 --> 54:10.914
It's true.

54:12.195 --> 54:13.446
Now, you know what?

54:14.125 --> 54:16.933
I've been doing a lot of incredible
things for you guys tonight,

54:17.532 --> 54:19.905
but now it's time
for me to do you

54:19.966 --> 54:22.108
the greatest honour
of your lives.

54:22.259 --> 54:26.130
I'm going to baptise you
all in the name of myself.

54:26.304 --> 54:27.690
Are you ready for it?

54:29.933 --> 54:32.392
This is gonna be an
incredible moment for you.

54:32.560 --> 54:34.521
Now, in the church of myself,

54:34.604 --> 54:36.022
how you baptise someone

54:36.106 --> 54:38.316
is you show them
all of your talents.

54:38.400 --> 54:41.027
So I'm gonna show you
that I'm not just a triple threat.

54:41.111 --> 54:42.529
I am a five threat.

54:42.612 --> 54:44.781
Acting, singing, dancing,
modelling, magician.

54:44.842 --> 54:47.231
And I'm about to do
all five of my talents

54:47.292 --> 54:49.180
on this stage to
baptise you all.

54:49.286 --> 54:52.747
The first of many talents
is my modelling abilities.

54:52.831 --> 54:55.875
You guys are about to see me
do the most incredible modelling,

54:55.959 --> 54:59.754
runway walk, fashion show
you've ever seen in your entire life,

54:59.838 --> 55:02.465
so get ready to have your
minds freaking blown.

55:02.882 --> 55:04.259
Get ready for this.

55:34.456 --> 55:35.957
# Your strip is served #

55:42.797 --> 55:46.301
# Model, model, model, model #

55:46.634 --> 55:50.096
# Model, model, model, model #

55:59.929 --> 56:01.602
That was incredible.

56:02.943 --> 56:05.612
But you guys are not baptised yet.
Oh, no.

56:05.673 --> 56:08.926
I know you probably are feeling
very baptised and holy,

56:09.032 --> 56:12.285
but you won't be baptised and
holy until I do all my talents.

56:12.429 --> 56:17.082
So the next talent is my dancing ability.
Who wants to see that?

56:21.024 --> 56:22.692
Good, 'cause you're about to.

56:22.801 --> 56:24.157
I'm about to blow your minds.

56:24.297 --> 56:26.755
I'm gonna do every trendy,

56:26.816 --> 56:29.677
iconic dance move that
has ever been created.

56:29.761 --> 56:30.958
Hit it!

56:31.221 --> 56:33.515
I'm about to prove I'm the
best dancer in the world.

56:33.598 --> 56:34.716
Get ready!

56:37.685 --> 56:39.312
# Dab, dab #

56:40.230 --> 56:41.147
# Dab, dab #

56:41.231 --> 56:45.110
# Running man, running man
Run, run, running man #

56:45.193 --> 56:48.780
# Whip and the nae nae
Whip and the nae nae #

56:48.863 --> 56:50.198
# Floss, floss #

56:50.740 --> 56:52.450
# I don't need a dentist
I floss #

56:52.534 --> 56:56.121
# Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot #

56:58.009 --> 56:58.798
Stop.

56:59.137 --> 57:00.727
This isn't good enough.

57:01.042 --> 57:03.094
I really need to step
it up a notch here

57:03.155 --> 57:05.187
if I'm gonna baptise
you guys, okay?

57:05.338 --> 57:09.352
I can't keep doing one talent at a time.
We'll be here forever.

57:09.592 --> 57:11.327
So to finish everything off

57:11.527 --> 57:14.013
and to make sure you
are fully baptised,

57:14.097 --> 57:17.100
I'm going to do
all of my talents,

57:17.183 --> 57:19.436
the remaining
talents I need to do,

57:19.519 --> 57:20.562
at one time.

57:20.645 --> 57:23.815
My acting, my singing,
and my magicianry.

57:23.898 --> 57:25.233
Are you ready for this?

57:31.906 --> 57:33.741
Once I do this,

57:33.825 --> 57:36.119
you will all
officially be baptised,

57:36.202 --> 57:39.456
and you will be part of the Holy
Church of the Virgin Miranda.

57:39.831 --> 57:42.167
So get ready to have
your minds exploded.

57:42.250 --> 57:44.919
But first, I need the help
of my assistant, Patrick.

57:45.003 --> 57:46.399
Welcome him to the stage.

57:54.929 --> 57:55.929
It's all right.

57:56.097 --> 57:58.248
As far as I know, I still
don't have the rights to you,

57:58.314 --> 58:01.406
so just, um, close your eyes
when you're looking at him,

58:01.467 --> 58:03.414
but keep them open when
you're looking at me so that

58:03.617 --> 58:04.655
it's like he's not here.

58:04.772 --> 58:05.982
So try that.

58:06.774 --> 58:09.694
All right. So I'm about to
do an incredible magic trick.

58:09.986 --> 58:12.864
This is going to go around
my neck and lock shut.

58:13.239 --> 58:15.992
Patrick is going to take
this very sharp sword.

58:16.075 --> 58:19.412
He's gonna stick it
through my neck, like so,

58:19.496 --> 58:21.134
whilst I am singing,

58:21.195 --> 58:23.739
and it will not affect
my vocal chords at all.

58:23.917 --> 58:24.834
Not only that,

58:24.918 --> 58:27.877
I'm gonna be doing the best acting
you've ever seen in your life

58:28.087 --> 58:30.412
because the best type
of music to act to

58:30.537 --> 58:32.308
and to sing to at the same time

58:32.473 --> 58:34.058
is opera music.

58:34.302 --> 58:39.140
So I'm gonna be singing a
famous opera song in Italian.

58:39.438 --> 58:43.650
So get ready to have your
minds freaking blown.

58:43.895 --> 58:44.896
Hit it!

58:45.498 --> 58:47.318
Stick it in me whenever
you want, Patrick.

58:50.084 --> 58:56.174
# O mio babbino caro #

58:58.201 --> 59:05.166
# Mi piace bello #

59:05.833 --> 59:09.123
# Bello #

59:09.285 --> 59:15.040
# A pizza with meatballs and pepperoni
And a sausage #

59:15.510 --> 59:19.973
# Yo quiero Taco Bell #

59:21.497 --> 59:23.833
# Mi struggo #

59:24.216 --> 59:29.847
# E mi tormento #

59:30.149 --> 59:33.432
# O Dio #

59:38.366 --> 59:40.660
# Vorrei #

59:41.619 --> 59:46.624
# Morir #

59:47.083 --> 59:51.045
Aah!

59:55.842 --> 59:58.094
Thank you, guys!
You've been a great audience.

59:58.177 --> 59:59.721
You're all baptised.

59:59.782 --> 01:00:01.119
Have a great night.

01:00:11.554 --> 01:00:14.431
'Why are you a YouTuber?
I'm not a hater. I just hate your vids.

01:00:14.569 --> 01:00:15.569
And your voice.'

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:17.961
'You look uglier than my ass.

01:00:18.171 --> 01:00:19.258
No ofoinse.'

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:21.633
'Does she have cancer?

01:00:21.694 --> 01:00:23.336
'Cause I don't want to make
fun of her if she does.

01:00:23.397 --> 01:00:25.038
She's so effing annoying.'

01:00:25.496 --> 01:00:26.637
'Your cloths are so ugly.'

01:00:26.698 --> 01:00:28.496
Maybe you need to
go to a model class.

01:00:28.557 --> 01:00:29.315
Your cloths look like pyjamas.

01:00:29.375 --> 01:00:30.396
'You don't know
what you're wearing.

01:00:30.457 --> 01:00:32.974
You look good to you.
You look bad to me.'

01:00:34.255 --> 01:00:36.174
# 'Roses are red, violets are blue #'

01:00:36.257 --> 01:00:38.176
# Pornhub is down
Colleen Ballinger will do' #

01:00:38.259 --> 01:00:40.011
# 'Her face is a rip off, so sad' #

01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:41.888
# 'Nice fonking forehead' #

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:42.971
# 'Butt...' #

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:44.890
# '...Head' #

01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:48.436
# 'Totally stupid' #

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:51.356
# 'I hatte you with a passion
Thumbs up' #

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:53.239
# 'Her face scarets me
She neds more make-up' #

01:00:53.316 --> 01:00:55.068
# 'She has a uniboob' #

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:58.946
# 'I'm pretty sure
Her vagina smells like cat food' #

01:00:59.947 --> 01:01:01.093
That one's accurate.

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:05.787
# You might think that I'm hurt
Or I'm feeling abused #

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:09.415
# But I'm not, I'm getting paid
From your comments and views #

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:12.877
# So keep the comments coming
But here's some help #

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.131
# Before you go insulting people
Maybe learn how to spell #

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:19.008
# Dum-da-dum #

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:20.093
# Dum-da-dum #

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:22.345
# You sound so dumb, dumb, dumb #

01:01:22.428 --> 01:01:24.347
# You sound so dumb #

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:26.231
'What the duck is wrong with her face?

01:01:26.292 --> 01:01:27.752
Duck, duck, duck, duck!'

01:01:27.813 --> 01:01:29.087
'There are eight-year-olds...

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.603
watching this.'

01:01:31.354 --> 01:01:33.356
'She looks fat but still pretty.'

01:01:33.439 --> 01:01:35.195
# 'I think she might be a dude' #

01:01:35.256 --> 01:01:36.382
# 'You remind me of a raisin #

01:01:36.442 --> 01:01:38.861
# 'Cause you have wrinkles
And everyone hates you' #

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.887
# 'You look like Maranda'
'You look like Mirada' #

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:42.507
# 'Are you Merinda?'
'Are you Amanda?' #

01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:46.035
# 'Are you Mirrrinda?'
'Are you Marinade Sings? No ofens' #

01:01:46.285 --> 01:01:49.580
You know, I'm not a marinade,
so none taken.
