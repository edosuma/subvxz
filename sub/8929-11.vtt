who stole the golden disk,

may have taken them into another time zone.

Aw, that was mega-low, Optimus.

02:11.987 --> 02:14.755
I was only racing Rattrap.

02:14.855 --> 02:16.988
I could have been a Predacon scout.

When you're outside the base, you pay attention.

OPTIMUS: What's going on?

02:56.162 --> 03:00.596
The long-range scanner, it's picking up signals from space.

03:00.696 --> 03:04.763
Ah. But I can't punch through the energon interference.

03:07.530 --> 03:08.797
( growls )

03:08.897 --> 03:12.498
It's probably a Predacon trick.

03:12.598 --> 03:15.731
Or something worse. ( gasps )

03:15.831 --> 03:18.999
Rattrap, see if you can get me a visual.

03:19.098 --> 03:20.365
Yeah. On it.

03:20.465 --> 03:22.832
Rattrap, maximize.

03:31.501 --> 03:34.335
I need more power. Cheetor?

Maximize.

03:35.702 --> 03:37.168

03:42.102 --> 03:45.469
Yeah, almost there. Come on, baby.

03:45.569 --> 03:48.670
Come on. Give it up for the rat.

Is that what I think it is?

RHINOX: Yep. A temporal probe. Cybertron's found us.

04:05.440 --> 04:09.673
You're pulling our circuits. We're going home?

04:11.307 --> 04:14.875
If we can make contact before it moves away.

04:14.975 --> 04:18.075
Yes! Ha-ha-ha!

04:18.175 --> 04:20.242
Can you break through the interference?

04:20.342 --> 04:23.076
I'm gonna give it a Maximal try.

Talk about major crash.

04:47.414 --> 04:50.213
Hmm. You did your best, Rhinox.

04:50.313 --> 04:52.248
No one could have done more.

04:52.348 --> 04:55.348
Yeah. Fearless leader's right.

04:55.448 --> 04:59.315
No, he's not. I blew it.

05:00.582 --> 05:03.482
But we might still have a chance.

05:03.582 --> 05:05.083
What do you mean?

05:05.183 --> 05:06.884
You know how probes work.

05:06.983 --> 05:10.583
They home in on the transwarp signature of the missing ship.

05:10.683 --> 05:15.451
But our transwarp engine's been offline since the crash.

05:15.551 --> 05:17.818
That's why the probe moved on.

05:17.918 --> 05:21.019
But it'll be back just before it leaves this system.

05:21.119 --> 05:24.153
If we can duplicate our transwarp signature

05:24.253 --> 05:27.020
before it returns and send it to the probe...

05:27.120 --> 05:29.421
We'll be on our way home.

05:29.521 --> 05:32.854
CHEETOR: Home? All right! RATTRAP: Yes!

05:38.155 --> 05:40.922

Ah. That's our foundation. Let's get to work.

05:44.756 --> 05:48.791
You do realize we're in Predacon territory.

05:48.891 --> 05:51.824
Yeah. You know, Dino-bore's got a point.

05:51.924 --> 05:56.092
If the Preds catch us up here, we'll be beautiful targets.

05:56.191 --> 05:58.691
This was the nearest clear zone.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.526
Building the signal ray here

06:00.626 --> 06:02.826
is our best shot at contacting the probe.

06:02.926 --> 06:05.660
And Tigatron will watch our backs.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.960

06:12.060 --> 06:14.061
The air is sweet today.

06:30.831 --> 06:34.064
No matter what Megatron said,

06:34.165 --> 06:39.166
Waspinator is tired of searching for Maximals.

06:39.266 --> 06:40.832

06:40.932 --> 06:43.733
Your search is over, Predacon.

06:43.833 --> 06:45.833

06:49.700 --> 06:51.901
Next time you're looking for Maximals,

06:52.001 --> 06:54.601
keep your mind on the job.

06:54.701 --> 06:57.968
His job was bait. Heh-heh.

06:58.068 --> 07:00.169
And you're the trap?

07:00.269 --> 07:03.402
Not a trap, Maximal. A test.

07:03.502 --> 07:05.936
Of what?

07:06.036 --> 07:08.437
TARANTULAS: Of my new toy. Ha-ha-ha!

Optimus to Tigatron.

07:26.373 --> 07:28.506
Cheetor, scout and report. Go.

07:28.606 --> 07:30.607
I'm gone.

07:30.707 --> 07:32.340
Beast mode.

07:34.208 --> 07:35.908
I'll follow him.

07:36.008 --> 07:39.241
He may need my warrior skills.

07:39.341 --> 07:40.942
No. We need you here.

07:41.042 --> 07:43.476
We haven't got much time to finish the array.

07:43.576 --> 07:45.476
Oh, of course.

07:45.576 --> 07:49.277
We wouldn't want to miss our chance to go home.

07:49.377 --> 07:53.011
Hey, what's biting your sensors, Dino-Boob?

07:53.111 --> 07:55.678
You act like you don't wanna get off this dirt ball.

07:55.778 --> 07:59.045
Afraid you'll miss your Pred-head friends?

07:59.145 --> 08:01.479
You're what I'm afraid of.

08:01.579 --> 08:04.979
You're so eager to go home.

08:05.079 --> 08:08.413
But your home is not mine.

08:08.513 --> 08:12.147
I am Predacon, despite our alliance.

08:12.247 --> 08:15.347
And when your ship comes to rescue you,

08:15.448 --> 08:20.348
my fate will be the same as Megatron's.

08:20.449 --> 08:23.383
Perhaps, even worse.

08:23.483 --> 08:25.950
We won't let that happen, Dinobot.

08:26.049 --> 08:29.217
You're a Maximal now and we'll see that you're treated as one.

08:29.317 --> 08:34.285
And what makes you think I want to be?

08:36.018 --> 08:37.685

Inevitably, the lens will find you.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.721

08:55.822 --> 08:58.721
By the Matrix, what's happening?

08:58.822 --> 09:02.222
It works. How gratifying.

09:02.322 --> 09:04.722
Tarantulas, terrorize.

Tigatron, maximize. Maximize!

09:24.093 --> 09:28.993
Poor tiger. You never had a chance.

09:29.094 --> 09:32.194
He's got a better chance than you, chuckles.

09:33.427 --> 09:37.128
Unh! One wrong move and you're wreckage.

09:37.228 --> 09:40.062
Step away from Tigatron. Slowly.

09:40.162 --> 09:43.162
As you wish.

10:21.902 --> 10:25.236
One-point-four megacycles.

10:26.703 --> 10:29.037
Better get my gears in high.

Optimus to Cheetor and Tigatron.

10:43.706 --> 10:46.439
Respond at once.

10:54.841 --> 10:57.107
Megatron must know.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.808
Take this to him immediately.

10:59.908 --> 11:01.843
I'll keep an eye on the Maximals.

11:01.942 --> 11:05.776
Whatever they're doing, we'll soon put a stop to it.

11:05.876 --> 11:07.343

BLACKARACHNIA: Is it a weapon?

11:19.045 --> 11:21.679
TERRORSAUR: It looks more like a long-range signal array.

11:21.779 --> 11:23.179
MEGATRON: Yes.

11:23.279 --> 11:24.546
But why would Optimus risk

11:24.645 --> 11:26.580
building it inside our perimeter?

11:26.680 --> 11:29.613
( Cheetor groans )

11:30.680 --> 11:33.714
Maybe we should ask the kittens.

11:33.814 --> 11:36.582
Oh. Excellent idea.

11:38.582 --> 11:42.949
Whoa. Talk about nightmares.

11:43.049 --> 11:46.083
Your nightmares are just beginning, Maximal,

11:46.183 --> 11:48.083
unless you tell me about the signal array

11:48.183 --> 11:49.750
Optimus is building.

11:49.850 --> 11:54.084
Oh. Why don't you ask him yourself, Mega-dumb?

11:54.184 --> 11:56.952
You're trying my patience, feline.

11:57.051 --> 11:59.418
( scanner beeping ) What's that?

11:59.518 --> 12:01.152
The space scanner.

12:01.252 --> 12:02.986
It's picking up some sort of craft.

12:03.085 --> 12:05.719
It'll be over the planet in ten seconds.

12:05.819 --> 12:07.253
The probe!

12:07.353 --> 12:11.120
Ah! Probe?

12:11.221 --> 12:12.887
Prepare for full-scale assault.

12:12.987 --> 12:15.187
The array must be destroyed immediately.

12:15.287 --> 12:18.621
Tarantulas, bring the transformation lock lens.

12:20.655 --> 12:23.356
Oh. Me and my big mouth.

12:23.455 --> 12:25.822
They would've attacked the array anyway.

12:25.922 --> 12:29.090
But at least they left us unguarded.

12:32.924 --> 12:34.491
What are you doing?

12:34.591 --> 12:37.458
You always say what a swinging cat you are.

12:37.558 --> 12:39.258
So start swinging.

12:39.358 --> 12:42.359
And maybe we can free ourselves from these cages.

12:42.459 --> 12:44.226
( Cheetor grunts )

12:44.326 --> 12:46.793
( dramatic theme playing )

12:50.060 --> 12:52.061
There, done.

12:52.160 --> 12:55.228
All it needs now is the transwarp module.

12:55.328 --> 12:59.128
Assuming Rhinox can get it here in time.

12:59.229 --> 13:01.329
Hey, don't worry. He will.

13:01.429 --> 13:04.195
Heh. Not that you give a nanobyte.

13:04.295 --> 13:05.829
( grunts ) Rattrap.

13:05.929 --> 13:09.697
Ah, to the inferno with both of you.

13:09.797 --> 13:11.897
( grunts )

13:11.997 --> 13:15.097
Megatron has ordered this tower demolished.

13:16.164 --> 13:17.798
Interceptors, fire.

13:20.398 --> 13:22.866
Chew on this, Optimus Primal.

13:22.966 --> 13:25.600
( screams )

13:26.766 --> 13:29.466
I don't think so.

13:31.300 --> 13:35.101
And I really don't think so.

13:35.201 --> 13:36.968
( screams )

13:39.068 --> 13:40.401
( thuds )

13:42.202 --> 13:44.703
Hmm.

13:52.537 --> 13:54.271
Yee-haw!

13:54.371 --> 13:56.738

Whoa! Unh.

14:28.376 --> 14:30.377
( coughs )

14:30.476 --> 14:31.977
I knew that was good for something.

14:32.077 --> 14:34.811
Other than swatting flies.

14:34.911 --> 14:36.245
What now?

14:36.345 --> 14:39.445
Do you know where the Predacons' repair chamber is?

14:39.545 --> 14:42.612
So we can escape this transformation lock?

14:42.712 --> 14:44.346
Follow me.

14:47.546 --> 14:49.713
( suspenseful theme playing )

14:54.181 --> 14:57.882
Scorponok's attack was meant only to soften us up.

14:57.982 --> 15:01.582
Megatron will be coming in force.

15:01.681 --> 15:05.516
Well, maybe Rhinox will get here before him.

15:25.353 --> 15:28.219
Hey. Hey, where's leather puss going?

15:28.319 --> 15:31.920
He always was a coward.

15:32.020 --> 15:33.621
MEGATRON: Granted.

15:33.721 --> 15:36.554
But he makes an excellent diversion.

15:36.654 --> 15:39.355
You don't know what you're doing, Megatron.

15:39.455 --> 15:41.221
Oh, on the contrary.

15:41.321 --> 15:44.389
I know all about the probe from Cybertron,

15:44.489 --> 15:46.689
and I mean to see you don't contact it.

15:46.789 --> 15:48.723
Predacons, attack!

16:43.499 --> 16:45.900
Maximize!

16:45.999 --> 16:48.566
Hey, you okay, chopper face?

16:48.666 --> 16:52.667
I... I can't transform.

16:52.767 --> 16:55.468
Must be that gizmo of Mega-- Unh!

16:58.334 --> 17:00.002
Oh, no.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.135
Oh, yes.

17:02.235 --> 17:04.335
( Rattrap screams )

17:09.470 --> 17:11.870
Your time has come, Optimus.

17:11.970 --> 17:14.638
Guess again.

17:14.737 --> 17:17.437
Aah! Unh! No. No.

17:54.211 --> 17:56.211

17:57.344 --> 17:59.545
But in the end, the result is the same.

17:59.645 --> 18:02.412
Yes. Huh?

18:02.512 --> 18:05.046
Don't count on it, motor head.

18:05.145 --> 18:06.812
( screams )

18:10.046 --> 18:11.446
Optimus?

18:11.547 --> 18:13.947
Ah. I'll be all right.

18:14.047 --> 18:17.015
The array, there isn't much time.

18:30.983 --> 18:33.350
Unh. Rhinox.

18:33.450 --> 18:35.417
Hold on. I'm almost finished.

18:35.517 --> 18:38.118
All I have to do now is enter the code.

18:39.718 --> 18:41.351
( grunts )

18:41.451 --> 18:43.852
No!

18:47.719 --> 18:50.320
Rhinox, maximize.

( grunting )

18:53.954 --> 18:55.687
( grunting )

18:58.121 --> 19:00.222
You've got to enter the rest of the code.

19:00.321 --> 19:02.155
I can't do it in this form.

19:02.255 --> 19:05.222
How sad.

19:05.322 --> 19:09.323
No Predacon will become a Maximal prisoner while I rule.

19:09.423 --> 19:12.057
Megatron. No.

Delightful.

19:46.362 --> 19:48.930
Now, just one more thing.

19:49.030 --> 19:50.663
( groans )

19:52.697 --> 19:55.997
Time for you to decorate a cage, Mega-Dork.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.531
I think not.

20:00.631 --> 20:03.432
Cybertron won't find you now and the war will go on.

20:03.532 --> 20:06.066
Until I am the victor.

20:13.167 --> 20:15.067
Did we get our signal to the probe?

20:15.167 --> 20:17.668
Are we going home?

20:17.768 --> 20:20.569
Not today, Cheetor.

20:20.668 --> 20:22.368
But someday.
