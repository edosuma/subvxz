WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.195
- Previously on Being Human.

00:04.230 --> 00:05.368
(Sally gasping)

00:05.400 --> 00:06.629
- Sally?

00:06.670 --> 00:07.762
Dad thinks you're dead!

00:07.800 --> 00:09.234
- I know, Robbie.

00:09.270 --> 00:12.069
Please, just don't
say anything to Dad.

00:12.110 --> 00:13.600
- Why did you
come back to Boston?

00:13.640 --> 00:16.644
- To kill vampires
before they kill people.

00:16.680 --> 00:17.750
- Does that include me?

00:17.780 --> 00:19.418
- Not if you help me.

00:19.450 --> 00:21.111
- God!

00:21.150 --> 00:23.244
The house! The '70s!

00:23.290 --> 00:24.519
I'm travelling through time.

00:24.550 --> 00:25.688
- Things are quiet now.

00:25.720 --> 00:28.257
- How long do you think
the peace will last?

00:28.290 --> 00:29.485
I'm joining the pack.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.127
(Screaming)

00:32.159 --> 00:33.753
- Kenny!

00:33.800 --> 00:34.756
(Groaning)

00:36.730 --> 00:38.824
- He's a time bomb, Josh.

00:38.870 --> 00:40.565
- We need to
stick together.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.136
- These people need us.

00:42.170 --> 00:44.138
We can do this.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.706
(Birds chirping)

01:08.160 --> 01:10.162
- Nora, are you up?

01:12.440 --> 01:14.192
(Moaning)

01:17.910 --> 01:20.072
- Josh?

01:21.340 --> 01:23.149
- Wendy!

01:24.880 --> 01:26.712
Where is everybody?

01:28.580 --> 01:30.309
- I'm not sure.

01:30.350 --> 01:34.287
- Um, well,
this is, uh...

01:34.320 --> 01:35.856
- This is crazy, right?

01:35.890 --> 01:37.426
- Yeah!

01:37.460 --> 01:39.599
What do we think
happened last night?

01:39.630 --> 01:43.589
- I think our
animals took over.

01:43.630 --> 01:47.840
I mean, I don't remember
everything, but I feel--

01:47.870 --> 01:49.201
- Oh my God!

01:51.640 --> 01:53.734
- Relax!

01:53.780 --> 01:56.772
Wolves are wolves, Josh.

01:56.810 --> 01:58.608
(Panting)

01:58.650 --> 02:01.119
- We gotta find
everyone else,

02:07.360 --> 02:09.419
(Sighing)

02:11.360 --> 02:13.624
- (Caroline):
Oh, little April did great

02:13.660 --> 02:15.321
for her first change, right?

02:15.360 --> 02:18.330
- (Andrew): She's beautiful,
just like her mother.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.508
- I'm sorry,
baby werewolf?

02:22.540 --> 02:24.508
Beats a dancing-cat
video anytime.

02:24.540 --> 02:27.475
Look at this!
- Yeah, she's cute.

02:27.510 --> 02:29.478
- Where are you
coming from, anyway?

02:29.510 --> 02:31.672
I thought we were
all in the same hollow.

02:31.710 --> 02:34.418
- Yeah, I woke up way
far away from you. I, um...

02:34.450 --> 02:36.942
And I think my wolf
was tracking some big--

02:36.990 --> 02:38.412
I think it was a moose.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.656
- A moose!
- I think so.

02:39.690 --> 02:40.782
- This close
to the city?

02:40.820 --> 02:43.289
- Yeah, it's
crazy. I know.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.287
- (Nora):
Did you eat it?

02:45.330 --> 02:47.253
- (Josh): Um...

02:47.300 --> 02:48.256
No.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.790
- You don't remember.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.764
- I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.531
- I thought you were
more aware of your wolf now,

02:54.570 --> 02:55.560
after everything.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.568
- I am, but
sometimes I'm not.

02:57.610 --> 02:59.533
Like, I don't
remember anything.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.934
- Is your wolf hungover?

03:00.980 --> 03:02.402
- (Wendy):
Oh yesÂ¥)

03:02.450 --> 03:04.509
That is what we need,
a hangover breakfast.

03:04.550 --> 03:05.506
I'm starving.

03:05.550 --> 03:07.245
That change felt
like a marathon.

03:07.280 --> 03:10.545
- You guys wanna do the sausage-
French-toast sandwich place?

03:10.590 --> 03:11.989
- (Nora): Yeah!

03:12.020 --> 03:15.786
- For Josh, maybe they've got
a moose burger or something.

03:15.820 --> 03:17.822
- Yeah, I would love to.
Should we go?

03:17.860 --> 03:20.727
- Uh, I would normally love to,
as well, but we can't.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.467
We have that--
We have a thing.

03:22.500 --> 03:23.661
We have a thing today.

03:23.700 --> 03:24.929
- (Nora): Well...

03:24.970 --> 03:26.734
Right! Yes!

03:26.770 --> 03:28.568
We have a thing
today. I forgot.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.807
Um, so, I guess,
next time?

03:30.840 --> 03:31.932
- Bye, guys!
- Bye!

03:31.970 --> 03:32.937
- All right!

03:32.980 --> 03:33.936
- Bye!

03:36.480 --> 03:38.699
(Car honking)

03:38.750 --> 03:40.946
- I don't believe this!
- You OK, rock star?

03:40.980 --> 03:44.416
- How could I have gone through
my whole stock that quickly?

03:44.450 --> 03:46.452
Me and Kenny
didn't drink that much!

03:46.490 --> 03:47.719
- Bah! Are you serious?

03:47.760 --> 03:49.956
You was tore up
from the floor up!

03:49.990 --> 03:53.858
You lived, like, the
10 spring breaks I never had.

03:53.900 --> 03:57.461
Are you OK? You don't really
need that much blood, right?

03:57.500 --> 03:59.969
So couldn't you just look
at this as like a detox?

04:00.000 --> 04:02.606
- I'll figure something out.
- Something safe?

04:02.640 --> 04:05.564
- I'm just trying to see
where you're coming from.

04:05.610 --> 04:09.001
You can get naked and turn into
a supernatural beast with them,

04:09.040 --> 04:11.702
but you don't wanna eat
a short stack with them?

04:11.750 --> 04:13.775
- I just wanted
to come home with you.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.345
Why is that
so weird? Hey!

04:15.380 --> 04:16.450
- (Both): Hey!

04:16.490 --> 04:17.719
(Groaning)

04:17.750 --> 04:20.390
- We have the refrigerator
of a depressed bachelor.

04:20.420 --> 04:21.490
- Tell me about it.

04:21.519 --> 04:23.022
- There's food
at the restaurant

04:23.060 --> 04:24.050
with Wendy and Mark.

04:24.090 --> 04:25.057
- I'm sorry!

04:25.090 --> 04:26.057
(Doorbell buzzing)

04:26.090 --> 04:27.489
- You expecting someone?

04:27.530 --> 04:28.497
- Are we ever?

04:28.530 --> 04:30.225
- I'll get it.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.067
- What's up?

04:35.100 --> 04:36.636
Aidan, right?

04:36.670 --> 04:38.502
- Josh, actually.
And yeah, right.

04:38.540 --> 04:39.507
- Yeah.

04:39.540 --> 04:40.530
- Come on in, Robbie!

04:40.580 --> 04:41.775
- (Sally):
Whoa! Robbie?

04:41.810 --> 04:42.777
- Hey!

04:42.810 --> 04:44.369
- Hi!

04:44.410 --> 04:46.469
- What's he doing here?
Aidan, ask him what--

04:46.520 --> 04:47.874
- What brings
you here, RoRobbie?

04:47.920 --> 04:48.910
- Business!

04:48.950 --> 04:50.384
- Ask him
what kind--

04:50.420 --> 04:51.888
- What kind of business?
- Family.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.786
I'm helping my dad out
with the house,

04:53.820 --> 04:55.049
taking it off his hands.

04:55.090 --> 04:57.388
- I thought you
already did that.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.556
- No, that was rent.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.922
This is more of
a whole-house scenario.

05:00.960 --> 05:04.066
I'm selling
the place,

05:04.100 --> 05:07.070
so you have
30 days

05:07.100 --> 05:11.640
to either buy it
or vacate.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.074
Sorry.

05:26.860 --> 05:30.080
- Look, Robbie, this is
all kind of sudden.

05:30.130 --> 05:34.089
I mean, 30 days
to just leave our home?

05:34.130 --> 05:35.791
- I feel you.

05:35.830 --> 05:39.061
I do. Except 30 days
is actually the law.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.966
- It's actually
the bare minimum!

05:41.000 --> 05:42.707
- Yeah!

05:42.740 --> 05:46.472
- I don't buy that my dad would
wanna sell the house right now.

05:46.510 --> 05:47.978
There's something.
Is it drugs?

05:48.010 --> 05:49.569
- Why is he selling
so suddenly?

05:49.610 --> 05:51.704
- Drug money for Robbie?
For cancer treatment?

05:51.750 --> 05:52.979
- Oh my God!
- No one's sick?

05:53.020 --> 05:54.613
Right? Like,
no one has cancer?

05:54.650 --> 05:56.140
- Who are you?
Do you live here?

05:56.180 --> 05:57.579
- Yes, I live here.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.588
- This is Nora.
She's my wife.

05:59.620 --> 06:00.712
- (Robbie): Oh.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.455
- Why is he
selling the house?

06:02.490 --> 06:04.128
- Honestly?

06:04.160 --> 06:05.423
- That'd be nice.

06:05.460 --> 06:07.497
- I'm advising him to.

06:07.530 --> 06:11.489
It just makes the most sense
right now, financially.

06:11.530 --> 06:14.431
I had some work in Florida
that didn't really pan out.

06:14.470 --> 06:15.699
- (Sally):
You don't say!

06:15.740 --> 06:18.107
- This place is kind of
depressing to my dad.

06:18.140 --> 06:20.609
I mean, he thinks my sister...

06:20.640 --> 06:22.176
It's just, there's
no good reason

06:22.210 --> 06:24.099
for him to hold
onto it right now.

06:24.150 --> 06:26.619
If I can help him unload it,
then everybody wins.

06:26.650 --> 06:27.742
- Everyone except us!

06:27.780 --> 06:29.009
- I haven't
told my dad

06:29.050 --> 06:31.587
that my sister's
a fugitive or whatever.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.657
I know that you're
friends with her,

06:33.690 --> 06:35.613
so I'd appreciate it
if you let her know

06:35.660 --> 06:36.889
that I'm selling
the place.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.159
- Yeah.

06:38.190 --> 06:39.726
- Oh yeah!
I got it.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.489
I appreciate that.
Thank you so much!

06:41.530 --> 06:43.066
- We'll tell her--
- Robbie, thanks!

06:43.100 --> 06:44.727
- We'll tell her
when we see her.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.067
- Cool! Thanks!

06:46.100 --> 06:48.797
I've already set up
a few viewing appointments.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.160
- What?

06:50.210 --> 06:53.032
- If you wouldn't mind
cleaning up the place a bit...

06:53.080 --> 06:55.503
- Hell no! You come in here,
tell us to vacate

06:55.540 --> 06:57.076
and start making
domestic demands?

06:57.110 --> 06:59.078
- Cleaning is the least
of your worries.

06:59.110 --> 07:00.145
- Aidan,
yell at him!

07:00.180 --> 07:01.773
- The plumbing
is substandard!

07:01.820 --> 07:03.811
Everyone expects
full copper these days.

07:03.850 --> 07:05.147
- Aidan, aim higher!

07:05.190 --> 07:06.658
- I figured as much,

07:06.690 --> 07:08.954
so I'll be in and out
over the next few days

07:08.990 --> 07:11.220
trying to fix up the house
as best as I can.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.797
Unless you buy it,
then nothing has to change.

07:13.830 --> 07:16.197
I'll take $300,000
for it as it is.

07:16.230 --> 07:17.789
- There it is. OK.

07:17.830 --> 07:18.968
- Just think
about it!

07:19.000 --> 07:21.537
Just let that stew.

07:21.570 --> 07:24.107
Right? Cool!

07:31.280 --> 07:33.112
- (Nora):
Thank you.

07:33.150 --> 07:34.948
- Thanks.

07:38.150 --> 07:40.790
- Hey!

07:40.820 --> 07:42.788
I know what
you're thinking.

07:42.830 --> 07:45.083
You're not ready
to leave the house.

07:45.130 --> 07:46.529
(Nora sighing)

07:46.560 --> 07:48.096
- No, I guess not.

07:48.130 --> 07:52.067
But I mean, it's not like any
of us can afford to buy it.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.194
Half of us don't
even really exist.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.560
(Chuckling)

07:55.600 --> 07:58.206
<i>- I know.</i>

07:58.240 --> 08:01.005
Part of me isn't
ready to leave either.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.078
- But?

08:04.110 --> 08:05.475
- No "but".

08:06.720 --> 08:09.018
I just wish you
didn't have to deal

08:09.050 --> 08:11.610
with this much
change right now.

08:11.650 --> 08:14.950
But it's not like
we have much of a choice.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.825
- What if there
was a choice?

08:23.870 --> 08:28.637
Just, what if we were going
on the normal timeline

08:28.670 --> 08:31.833
of normal
married people?

08:31.870 --> 08:35.033
I mean, would you wanna
get our own place?

08:35.080 --> 08:37.241
- No, Josh,
not right now,

08:37.280 --> 08:40.875
not with the way that
things are going with you.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.274
We talked
about this, OK?

08:42.320 --> 08:44.288
And I meant
what I said.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.584
Sally and Aidan
are our family,

08:46.620 --> 08:50.750
no matter how much time we end
up spending with this new pack.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.895
- OK, but?

08:54.930 --> 08:56.762
(Chuckling)

08:56.800 --> 08:58.791
- But...

09:01.040 --> 09:04.806
I see Andrew
and Caroline,

09:04.840 --> 09:06.638
April,

09:06.680 --> 09:10.139
Mark and Wendy,
making it work,

09:10.180 --> 09:13.616
and I want that
for us someday.

09:14.820 --> 09:19.087
But for you,
I can wait.

09:23.790 --> 09:25.588
- Maybe--

09:26.960 --> 09:29.019
Maybe you
shouldn't have to.

09:29.060 --> 09:30.789
- What do you mean?

09:30.830 --> 09:33.367
- Maybe we should just move out
on our own, by ourselves.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.040
Isn't that what
you're saying you want?

09:36.070 --> 09:39.677
- Yeah, but we can hardly afford
to get a place of our own.

09:39.710 --> 09:40.939
- I'll get another job.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.971
We shouldn't have to
put our lives on hold

09:43.010 --> 09:44.978
after everything
I've put you through.

09:45.010 --> 09:46.944
I just wanna
make you happy.

09:46.980 --> 09:49.574
I wanna do
this for you.

09:50.820 --> 09:52.709
You deserve it.

09:52.760 --> 09:56.355
- The first couple
that comes in to see the house,

09:56.390 --> 09:58.950
you just, like,
slaughter them, right?

09:58.990 --> 10:01.129
You just eat them like
it's Sunday brunch.

10:01.160 --> 10:02.969
Then I come and
bust all the pipes,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.320
and it's crazy town in here,

10:04.370 --> 10:06.122
and then no one ever
buys the house!

10:06.170 --> 10:08.366
- Listen, please stop
coming up with scenarios

10:08.400 --> 10:09.936
where I eat people, OK?

10:09.970 --> 10:11.335
- I forgot
you were hungry.

10:11.370 --> 10:13.702
Are you OK?
- Yeah!

10:13.740 --> 10:15.879
- Here's another one.
I bust all the pipes.

10:15.910 --> 10:17.708
You create a
strange diversion and--

10:17.750 --> 10:19.275
- That's good. Hey!

10:19.310 --> 10:20.675
- Hey! Guys!
Amazing.

10:20.720 --> 10:22.814
We have a plan
to save the house.

10:22.850 --> 10:23.885
Many solid plans.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.615
Watch.
Check this out.

10:29.290 --> 10:31.384
Except imagine
you can't see me.

10:31.430 --> 10:32.852
-It's a
floating lamp.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.390
Yeah, I get it.

10:34.430 --> 10:36.694
- OK, but we got others.

10:36.730 --> 10:38.892
For example, there was
this fire here once.

10:38.930 --> 10:40.295
- Once there
was a fire here.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.297
- Hold on. There were
a couple fires --

10:42.340 --> 10:44.832
the one where Danny
tried to burn us down,

10:44.870 --> 10:47.373
and where Bishop came
bursting through that window

10:47.410 --> 10:48.707
like the Kool-Aid guy.

10:48.740 --> 10:50.139
- Thanks for the reminder.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.911
- Is that what you're planning
on telling the realtor?

10:52.950 --> 10:54.418
- What have you
come up with?

10:54.450 --> 10:56.270
- What's your plan?
What you got?

10:56.320 --> 10:59.039
- We got nothing.

10:59.090 --> 11:00.979
- OK, well,
then family meeting.

11:01.020 --> 11:05.127
- No, no. What I mean is
maybe there isn't a plan,

11:05.160 --> 11:08.858
at least not one that
works for all of us.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.424
- Hold on for
a second.

11:11.470 --> 11:13.734
What exactly are
we saying here?

11:13.770 --> 11:17.308
- Listen, this house has
saved us all many times,

11:17.340 --> 11:21.004
but the reason you
and I moved in here

11:21.040 --> 11:23.941
was to find a place
where we could be normal.

11:23.980 --> 11:26.176
And against all odds,
I did that.

11:26.210 --> 11:27.871
We got married.

11:27.920 --> 11:32.448
And so, now, it just seems
like the next logical step

11:32.490 --> 11:34.458
is for us to move out,

11:34.490 --> 11:37.027
to find a place
of our own.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.328
(Sighing)

11:52.040 --> 11:55.408
(* ON AN ON singing Ghosts *)

11:55.440 --> 12:00.219
** There are spirits coming *

12:00.250 --> 12:02.275
* To find me *

12:02.320 --> 12:07.486
* They're not stopping
until it's do * e

12:07.520 --> 12:09.830
* And I can feel them *

12:09.860 --> 12:13.296
- (Suzanna):
Black-market blood?

12:13.330 --> 12:14.422
* Taking me ov **

12:14.460 --> 12:16.827
Come on, you're
better than that.

12:16.870 --> 12:18.827
At least,
you used to be.

12:18.870 --> 12:19.837
(Scoffing)

12:19.870 --> 12:21.031
No, don't go
in there.

12:21.070 --> 12:22.265
The blood is putrid!

12:22.300 --> 12:24.234
- Oh! I thought
I told you

12:24.270 --> 12:25.760
to get the hell
out of town!

12:25.810 --> 12:27.039
- The last time
I checked,

12:27.080 --> 12:30.277
you were no longer my lord
and master, Aidan Waite.

12:30.310 --> 12:32.870
- I mean that you're not
safe here, milady.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.775
There are people
looking for you.

12:34.820 --> 12:38.120
- I just don't feel ready to
leave Boston yet, but thank you.

12:38.150 --> 12:40.460
- I've warned you that
they'd stop at nothing,

12:40.490 --> 12:42.254
but neither
apparently will you.

12:42.290 --> 12:44.884
- I never really pegged you
for the type of guy

12:44.930 --> 12:47.194
to nurse your heartbreak
with a blood binge.

12:47.230 --> 12:50.268
Then again, you couldn't
even stomach my father's mead.

12:50.300 --> 12:53.270
- Well, I guess I'm a thirstier
vampire than I was a human,

12:53.300 --> 12:54.859
and your father's mead sucked.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.390
- Well...

12:56.440 --> 12:59.000
- So how the hell do
you know about Kat?

12:59.040 --> 13:01.532
- You're gonna have
to accept the fact

13:01.580 --> 13:04.072
that I know pretty
much everything.

13:04.110 --> 13:06.044
- Oh yeah, how
soon I forget.

13:06.080 --> 13:09.175
- Look, let's get
you out of here.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.445
(Scoffing)

13:12.490 --> 13:15.016
(Door opening)

13:15.060 --> 13:18.325
- It's a great neighbourhood,
lots of charm.

13:18.360 --> 13:21.898
I really think this kitchen
has great bones,

13:21.930 --> 13:24.592
exactly the type of
charm you don't find

13:24.630 --> 13:26.940
in those cookie-cutter condos.

13:26.970 --> 13:29.940
- When did you become
Robbie Realtor?

13:29.970 --> 13:33.235
Come on, Sally, fix this!
Scare the crap out of them!

13:33.280 --> 13:36.306
- I think there's a lot
to work with here.

13:36.340 --> 13:37.478
- Dammit!

13:37.510 --> 13:39.842
- Could we have
a contractor come in?

13:39.880 --> 13:41.348
- You can do
whatever you want.

13:41.380 --> 13:42.939
The seller is
very motivated.

13:42.990 --> 13:45.448
- Do you think they'd be
flexible on the 30 days?

13:45.490 --> 13:48.187
- We could work something out.
- Shut up, Robbie!

13:48.220 --> 13:51.326
- It would be nice to be settled
in by the end of the month.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.226
- Then I'm happy to
talk numbers today.

13:53.260 --> 13:54.921
- No, no, no!

13:54.960 --> 13:56.223
Screw it!

13:56.260 --> 13:57.967
(Muttering in foreign language)

13:58.000 --> 14:00.264
(Exhaling)

14:00.300 --> 14:01.461
(Coughing)

14:01.500 --> 14:02.490
- Oh!

14:02.540 --> 14:04.338
- Oh my God!

14:04.370 --> 14:05.633
I--I apologize!

14:05.670 --> 14:09.880
That--that smell is
not a normal thing here.

14:09.910 --> 14:11.105
(Groaning)

14:11.150 --> 14:13.619
You know, I'm sure
it's just the trash.

14:13.650 --> 14:16.517
- Or your badass sister!
Suck it, Robbie!

14:19.650 --> 14:21.209
Oh God!

14:21.260 --> 14:23.149
What year am I in now?

14:23.190 --> 14:25.352
Wait a sec!

14:25.390 --> 14:27.119
2009. Yep!

14:27.160 --> 14:30.095
I can tell by
Danny's stupid deep-V.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.497
- You guys gonna fix it up
before the wedding?

14:32.530 --> 14:34.362
- Don't!
- Excuse me? Don't what?

14:34.400 --> 14:36.129
- Chat me up
about the house.

14:36.170 --> 14:38.229
We're not exactly friends.
- Wonder why!

14:38.270 --> 14:41.308
- Because you think your
sister's too good for me.

14:41.340 --> 14:42.671
- I think you're paranoid,

14:42.710 --> 14:44.542
and I think you've
done a good job

14:44.580 --> 14:46.639
of keeping my sister
away from her family.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.512
- What did you want her to do,

14:48.550 --> 14:51.645
mooch off of them the rest
of her life like you do?

14:51.690 --> 14:53.180
- Hey! Robbie!

14:53.220 --> 14:54.654
This place is awesome, right?

14:54.690 --> 14:57.387
Do you wanna come over
this weekend to help paint?

14:57.430 --> 14:59.182
- It needs more
than a paint job.

14:59.230 --> 15:01.551
- It needs a lot of work,
but it's part of the fun.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.524
- I just don't know
why you waste your time.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.526
- Robbie, relax.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.265
- Are you kidding
me right now?

15:07.300 --> 15:10.008
- Can you please spare me
your drama on the day

15:10.040 --> 15:12.600
that I move into my first house
with my fianc?

15:12.640 --> 15:15.029
- Hey, come inside.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.572
- OK, just give me a sec.

15:18.610 --> 15:20.009
Are you day-drinking?

15:20.050 --> 15:21.540
Danny and I are
getting married.

15:21.580 --> 15:24.550
I don't need you to buy me,
like, a stand mixer,

15:24.590 --> 15:27.287
but I also don't need you
to piss all over the house.

15:27.320 --> 15:28.355
- He's a creep!

15:28.390 --> 15:30.552
Why am I the only
one who can see that?

15:30.590 --> 15:32.058
- Because you're delusional!

15:33.330 --> 15:35.458
OK, Mom and Dad
are coming soon,

15:35.500 --> 15:38.162
and I really don't want it
to be weird for them.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.669
- Yeah, don't worry.
I'm out of here.

15:44.240 --> 15:47.369
- (Suzanna): Sorry about
what happened with Kat.

15:47.410 --> 15:49.071
She seemed
like a nice girl.

15:49.110 --> 15:50.703
- Well, you told me
it would happen.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.502
- Oh! Well, just
because I'm right,

15:52.550 --> 15:54.245
doesn't mean I'm
not sympathetic.

15:54.280 --> 15:56.044
(Chuckling)

15:56.080 --> 15:59.050
- See, now, I get it. This is
why you can't leave Boston.

15:59.090 --> 16:01.388
It's because my life is
an amazing soap opera.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.582
- Well, you do live
with 2 wolves and a ghost.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.052
What kind of
freak are you?

16:05.090 --> 16:06.057
- A homeless one.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.524
The wolves
are moving out.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.359
- Surely you've been
on your own before.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.462
- Yeah, but not
with great success.

16:14.500 --> 16:17.265
It helps having
someone who worries

16:17.310 --> 16:20.109
when you don't come
home at night.

16:20.140 --> 16:23.075
Living with them, being
with Kat, it helped me.

16:23.110 --> 16:25.477
I wanna be
something better.

16:25.510 --> 16:29.117
- I see why we married so young.
You're just afraid to be alone.

16:29.150 --> 16:32.484
(Chuckling, groaning)

16:32.520 --> 16:35.080
(Exhaling sharply)

16:35.120 --> 16:38.681
- No, I think
you're right.

16:38.730 --> 16:42.621
I was clearly no great
shakes when I lost you.

16:42.660 --> 16:45.095
Look, um, I really
appreciate you saving me

16:45.130 --> 16:47.098
from another bender,

16:47.140 --> 16:49.495
but honestly,
I need to eat something.

16:49.540 --> 16:51.565
- You ate
yesterday, didn't you?

16:51.610 --> 16:55.240
- Yeah, well, it looks like
I've built up an appetite.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.305
- Well, let's
break it down.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.307
(Groaning)

17:01.550 --> 17:04.440
(Seagulls squawking)

17:08.619 --> 17:10.122
- Hi!

17:10.160 --> 17:11.525
- Thanks for meeting me.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.722
I--I only have a
little bit of time.

17:13.760 --> 17:16.650
Nora and I are supposed
to go look at a place.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.259
- Oh! You guys are moving?

17:18.300 --> 17:20.791
- Yeah, maybe.
I don't know.

17:20.839 --> 17:22.433
Just, yeah, thanks.

17:22.470 --> 17:25.064
- And thanks for
making me feel

17:25.109 --> 17:27.169
like we're in
a Russian-spy novel,

17:27.210 --> 17:28.803
Why are you
acting so weird?

17:28.840 --> 17:30.740
We didn't do
anything wrong!

17:30.780 --> 17:35.149
- We're both married
to other people.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.683
- Yeah, and we're animals.

17:37.720 --> 17:41.179
Look, I know you've been
a wolf longer than I have,

17:41.220 --> 17:43.826
but it just feels right.

17:43.860 --> 17:47.728
During the change, I feel
more connected with myself,

17:47.760 --> 17:50.559
and it's a pretty sensual
experience, don't you think?

17:50.600 --> 17:53.763
- No. No, I've never
looked at it like that.

17:53.800 --> 17:57.202
- Really? 'Cause it
was last night.

17:57.240 --> 18:01.370
I mean, isn't some part
of you open to that?

18:01.410 --> 18:04.710
To the pack?
To new possibilities?

18:04.750 --> 18:07.344
It could be so freeing
for you to just--

18:07.380 --> 18:09.872
- Are you and Mark, like,
swingers or something?

18:09.920 --> 18:11.581
- No!

18:11.620 --> 18:13.588
Mark doesn't
know what happened.

18:13.620 --> 18:15.349
I haven't told
him yet, but--

18:15.390 --> 18:17.620
- Yet? You're
gonna tell him?

18:17.660 --> 18:20.721
- We are forward-thinkers,
a new kind of pack.

18:20.760 --> 18:24.367
We accept the wolf.
We give in to it.

18:24.400 --> 18:28.769
- No, we're accountable for what
our wolves do to some degree.

18:28.800 --> 18:31.462
What we did last
night was wrong,

18:31.510 --> 18:35.469
and it affects me and it sure
as hell affects my wife.

18:35.510 --> 18:38.241
- I get what
you're saying.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.476
I do, but I also
love my husband,

18:40.520 --> 18:43.820
and our relationship
is based on honesty.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.409
- Listen to me.

18:45.450 --> 18:48.818
You obviously know Mark
way better than I do,

18:48.860 --> 18:51.488
but I know that Mark
would not be OK with this.

18:51.530 --> 18:52.782
- So what are
you saying?

18:52.830 --> 18:55.549
It's better they
find out some other way?

18:55.600 --> 18:57.364
- We're the only
ones who know!

18:57.400 --> 18:58.890
Don't do this.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.831
- OK, well, even if
I don't say anything,

19:01.870 --> 19:03.804
and you don't
say anything,

19:03.840 --> 19:07.276
who's to say they won't
know from our wolves?

19:07.310 --> 19:12.703
Listen, I may not be a wolf sage
like you think you are,

19:12.750 --> 19:15.412
but I do know one thing:

19:15.450 --> 19:18.579
Sooner or later, you're
gonna have to make peace

19:18.620 --> 19:20.782
with whatever
your wolf wants

19:20.820 --> 19:22.652
before it eats you alive.

19:22.690 --> 19:25.785
- Yeah, thanks
for meeting me.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.398
- Huh?

19:32.430 --> 19:33.659
- It stinks in here.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.668
- I know! I'm so sorry
about the smell.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.806
It's only a temporary glitch
while we replace the plumbing.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.706
- Jackson, honey,
don't be rude.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.879
- I need to go
to the bathroom.

19:42.910 --> 19:44.344
- Sorry, do you mind?

19:44.380 --> 19:45.575
- Of course, yeah.

19:45.610 --> 19:47.977
It's just right up
the stairs, straight to the--

19:48.020 --> 19:48.976
Oh! There he goes!

19:49.020 --> 19:50.681
(Chuckling)

19:51.890 --> 19:53.289
Cute kid.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.458
- Thank you.

19:54.490 --> 19:57.983
(Girl whispering, indistinct)

19:58.030 --> 20:00.954
- You know, I just read
an article in the Herald

20:01.000 --> 20:04.391
about how great the schools
are in this neighbourhood.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.590
(Girl whispering, indistinct)

20:08.640 --> 20:09.835
(Giggling)

20:09.870 --> 20:13.238
- (Girl): Jackson...

20:13.280 --> 20:14.338
(Giggling)

20:22.880 --> 20:26.987
- And you know, this is
all original woodwork.

20:27.020 --> 20:30.456
I really find it adds to
the property's classic charm.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.458
- That is nice.
- Yeah.

20:32.490 --> 20:33.719
- Hey, is that
fireplace--

20:33.760 --> 20:35.524
(Jackson screaming)

20:39.800 --> 20:42.770
- I heard something
in the closet.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.905
The door slammed on my hand,
and--and I fell.

20:44.940 --> 20:47.477
- How did the door
just slam on you?

20:47.510 --> 20:50.707
- Look at his forehead, Matthew.
He's bleeding.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.900
We should go.

20:52.950 --> 20:55.840
- Really? I mean,
I'm pretty sure he had that

20:55.880 --> 20:57.382
before he came in here.

20:57.420 --> 21:00.310
Are you sure you don't wanna
check out the stained glass?

21:00.360 --> 21:01.987
It's my favourite
part of the---

21:02.020 --> 21:03.829
(Door closing)

21:10.100 --> 21:12.319
Well, here goes nothing.

21:15.500 --> 21:16.661
- That place
was a bust.

21:16.700 --> 21:17.929
- We have to
face the fact

21:17.970 --> 21:20.064
that there's not
a lot in our price range.

21:20.110 --> 21:22.408
- Well, we can't live
in @ dump like that!

21:22.440 --> 21:23.805
- You already do, dude.

21:23.850 --> 21:26.342
- Oh my God!
What died in here?

21:26.380 --> 21:27.472
- I don't know.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.772
One minute, it's fine.

21:28.820 --> 21:31.539
The next, it's all
Bog of Eternal Stench.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.888
Like I said before,
the plumbing is a little iffy.

21:33.920 --> 21:36.059
- Yeah, I'd say it's
a bit more than--

21:36.090 --> 21:38.024
- Whoa!

21:38.060 --> 21:39.880
(Garbage disposal unit whirring)

21:39.930 --> 21:41.352
(Whirring stops)

21:41.400 --> 21:43.528
(Light crackling)

21:43.570 --> 21:44.696
Oh!

21:44.730 --> 21:47.631
- The electricity's
iffy too.

21:47.670 --> 21:50.731
- I'll get my tools.

21:51.970 --> 21:54.632
(Chuckling)

21:54.680 --> 21:56.774
- Sally's pissed!

21:56.810 --> 22:00.110
- Yep! We probably should've
talked it through more,

22:00.150 --> 22:03.040
the whole "uprooting
everyone's lives" thing.

22:03.080 --> 22:07.039
- No, we just started talking
about it. They'll come around.

22:07.090 --> 22:10.082
Sally will come around.
Aidan will come around.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.829
And listen, we haven't even
found a place yet, you know?

22:13.860 --> 22:16.056
It's not like we're
leaving Boston.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.859
Although, what if...

22:24.510 --> 22:29.710
What if we did? What if we did
just leave Boston entirely?

22:29.740 --> 22:30.946
- What?
- No, I'm--

22:30.980 --> 22:32.948
- What are you
talking about?

22:32.980 --> 22:35.620
You literally just said
we weren't doing that.

22:35.650 --> 22:37.982
- I know I said that,

22:38.020 --> 22:41.411
but I'm just saying, wouldn't it
be nice, like a fresh start,

22:41.460 --> 22:44.430
like a clean, white room that
no one's been murdered in?

22:44.460 --> 22:45.859
- Where is this
coming from?

22:45.890 --> 22:47.551
- Don't look at
me like that.

22:47.600 --> 22:50.695
- No, but seriously, what's
so bad here all of a sudden

22:50.730 --> 22:53.961
that we need to abandon our
lives and all of our friends?

22:54.000 --> 22:57.163
- No, no, no! I'm just
throwing out options, Nora.

22:57.200 --> 23:00.909
- OK, well, let's dial
it back a bit here.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.509
I don't think
we're ready.

23:04.550 --> 23:08.714
All T care about right
now is getting you back.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.445
The old you.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.844
All of you.

23:11.890 --> 23:14.780
I just think that you're
getting ahead of yourself.

23:14.820 --> 23:16.049
Look, obviously,

23:16.090 --> 23:19.651
I think that this is a good
idea for us some day,

23:19.690 --> 23:22.125
but do I think it's a good
idea for us right now,

23:22.160 --> 23:25.095
the way that things
are going with you?

23:26.570 --> 23:28.459
I don't know, Josh.

23:28.500 --> 23:29.797
(Sighing)

23:29.840 --> 23:33.037
I went along with it
to make you happy.

23:35.940 --> 23:37.647
- I'm going
for a run.

23:40.180 --> 23:42.649
- Yeah, of course you are.

23:44.120 --> 23:47.750
- So, you wanna
keep me sober

23:47.790 --> 23:50.009
by taking me to a bar?

23:50.060 --> 23:52.882
It just seems
counterintuitive.

23:52.930 --> 23:55.649
- Everywhere I go, this is
the perfect job for me.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.156
I work nights,
I stop brawls,

23:57.200 --> 24:00.898
I'm an old soul, so the
drunks like to talk to me,

24:00.940 --> 24:03.807
and everyone tips me in cash.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.899
Makes taxes easier.

24:05.940 --> 24:08.204
- Wow! I mean,
don't get me wrong.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.231
You were always smart.

24:10.280 --> 24:14.649
But seeing you like this,
it's something else.

24:14.680 --> 24:17.718
It'd be a shame
to waste it all

24:17.750 --> 24:19.946
by declaring war
on your own kind.

24:19.990 --> 24:23.051
A girl could get
herself killed.

24:23.090 --> 24:25.229
- Try not to be
so condescending.

24:25.260 --> 24:27.854
(Cell phone vibrating)

24:33.640 --> 24:37.190
- So, yeah, so now, having
made the worst mistake

24:37.240 --> 24:39.106
of my short married life,

24:39.140 --> 24:42.838
when the chance
to move out came up,

24:42.880 --> 24:44.575
I jumped on it.

24:44.610 --> 24:47.102
I thought it would
make Nora happy.

24:47.150 --> 24:51.087
Just move away from this
new pack, move forward.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.680
I know, I know.

24:53.720 --> 24:56.985
- I think that you're trading
one problem for another.

24:57.020 --> 24:59.557
Trust me,
I'm an authority

24:59.590 --> 25:01.627
on the consequences
of the quick fix.

25:01.660 --> 25:02.821
- Well, T know.

25:02.860 --> 25:05.227
- Hope you're a whiskey guy.

25:05.270 --> 25:06.590
- That's Suzanna.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.098
She's your guardian angel.

25:08.140 --> 25:11.166
- Yeah, I hate whiskey.

25:12.870 --> 25:15.100
Oh, I get it.
- You get what?

25:15.140 --> 25:17.177
- Well, hanging out
at a new bar,

25:17.210 --> 25:19.645
first-name basis with
the hot bartender.

25:19.680 --> 25:21.648
Things are a little
fresh still with Kat.

25:21.680 --> 25:22.977
- It's not like that.

25:23.020 --> 25:24.613
- Oh, are you
scoping dinner?

25:24.650 --> 25:26.118
(Stammering)

25:26.150 --> 25:27.982
- Nothing like
that either, OK?

25:28.020 --> 25:29.749
- All right.
That was my guess.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.121
- Why did you
bring it up?

25:31.160 --> 25:33.322
No, Suzanna is
my long-dead wife

25:33.360 --> 25:37.149
who I just found has been living
the past 200 years as a vampire.

25:38.770 --> 25:40.738
Kind of thing.

25:45.640 --> 25:46.801
- Sure.

25:46.840 --> 25:49.036
- Yeah.
That's not weird.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.172
- Mm-mmm.

25:50.210 --> 25:51.609
- It's not
a big deal.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.948
Actually, it's
a very big deal,

25:53.980 --> 25:56.950
but my point is I remember
what it's like to be married,

25:56.980 --> 25:59.688
to have someone
who knows you

25:59.720 --> 26:04.180
and knows the monster that
you are better than anyone.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.880
(Groaning)

26:05.930 --> 26:08.024
Oh God! B-negative.

26:08.060 --> 26:10.961
Anyway, listen.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.198
Telling Nora the truth,
it might relieve your guilt,

26:15.240 --> 26:18.938
but it won't do anything
but hurt your wife.

26:20.110 --> 26:22.101
- Isaac! No!

26:22.140 --> 26:24.142
(Screaming)

26:29.150 --> 26:31.915
- Sorry, man. This is
just one of those things.

26:31.950 --> 26:33.918
Yeah, one of those things

26:33.960 --> 26:38.852
that you have to keep from the
person you love to protect them.

26:45.170 --> 26:48.094
2009 is my own personal
Seventh Circle of Hell.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.859
It's all Danny making
sandwiches all the time.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.264
(Grunting)

26:53.740 --> 26:55.139
- Beer's in the fridge.

26:56.980 --> 26:59.278
- The place looks great.
Thanks for the invite.

26:59.310 --> 27:02.041
- I didn't invite you.
Your sister did.

27:02.080 --> 27:05.118
- Please let this be a moment
I never knew about

27:05.150 --> 27:06.845
where you
bitch-slapped Danny.

27:06.890 --> 27:08.415
- I don't wanna
fight with you.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.656
It's not fair to Sally,
SO you win.

27:10.690 --> 27:12.784
- No, you win.
Bitch-slap!

27:12.830 --> 27:14.320
- Just be good
to my sister.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.727
- I don't need to
fight you to win.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.660
Sally's fed up
of your drama,

27:18.700 --> 27:21.931
so give up trying to get her
to feel sorry for you,

27:21.970 --> 27:23.438
because it's not working.

27:23.470 --> 27:25.404
- Why are you
taking this crap?

27:25.440 --> 27:27.169
- It's not
about me, Danny.

27:27.210 --> 27:30.805
Look, Sally loves you
for some reason,

27:30.850 --> 27:32.375
so make her happy, OK?

27:32.410 --> 27:36.119
'Cause if you hurt her,
I swear I will kill you.

27:36.150 --> 27:39.415
- All right, here we go!
Casual death threat.

27:39.450 --> 27:40.713
Now bitch-slap!

27:40.760 --> 27:42.319
(Chuckling)

27:42.360 --> 27:45.751
- How do you think Sally would
feel if she heard you say that?

27:45.790 --> 27:47.428
- I'm willing to have
Sally hate me,

27:47.460 --> 27:50.225
if it means protecting her
from a dick like you.

27:50.260 --> 27:52.160
- Oh, nice!

27:57.470 --> 28:01.100
Now, why don't you just run
along like you always do,

28:01.140 --> 28:02.835
save us all some trouble?

28:06.450 --> 28:08.316
Oh! Hey, baby!

28:08.350 --> 28:10.717
Can you believe it's
already been a month?

28:10.750 --> 28:11.911
Oh!

28:11.950 --> 28:13.315
(Giggling)

28:13.350 --> 28:14.420
I love this place!

28:14.460 --> 28:16.258
- What I love is you.

28:18.060 --> 28:21.030
(Both snickering)

28:21.060 --> 28:24.769
- Don't look now, but I think
you've got some admirers.

28:24.800 --> 28:27.269
(Chuckling)

28:27.300 --> 28:29.496
- Boys, wanna finish up?
We're closing.

28:29.540 --> 28:31.235
- No! Come on, sweetie!

28:31.270 --> 28:33.978
One more drink,
and one for you too, huh?

28:34.010 --> 28:35.330
What do you say?

28:35.380 --> 28:37.769
- Why not? I mean,
you lose this guy,

28:37.810 --> 28:39.369
we'll have the place
to ourselves.

28:39.410 --> 28:42.141
- That is very sweet.
So flattering.

28:42.180 --> 28:44.387
Unfortunately,
I'm already spoken for.

28:44.420 --> 28:45.979
Isn't that right, Aidan?

28:46.020 --> 28:48.990
Yes. What?
I do speak for her.

28:49.020 --> 28:51.387
- Told you, dumb-ass!
- Shut up!

28:52.430 --> 28:54.057
- Boys, look at me.

28:54.100 --> 28:57.320
Now, this bar is closing,

28:57.360 --> 28:59.328
and you're both very tired.

28:59.370 --> 29:02.829
You just can't wait to get out
of here and go home, can you?

29:02.870 --> 29:04.759
You're gonna leave
this place right now.

29:04.810 --> 29:07.973
You're gonna walk home without
stopping and get into bed.

29:08.010 --> 29:10.104
Once there, you are going
to think about

29:10.140 --> 29:12.450
all the stupid things
you ever said to a girl

29:12.480 --> 29:14.118
in your whole life,

29:14.150 --> 29:17.120
and it's probably gonna make
you cry till you fall asleep.

29:17.150 --> 29:18.242
OK? What do you say?

29:18.290 --> 29:19.246
- Soft hair.

29:19.290 --> 29:20.485
- You're pretty.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.386
- Thank you! And?

29:22.420 --> 29:24.479
- Good night?
- Good night.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.157
- Thank you.

29:26.190 --> 29:28.955
(Aidan chuckling)

29:29.000 --> 29:30.866
"I do speak for her"?

29:30.900 --> 29:33.096
- Well, you caught me off guard.

29:33.130 --> 29:34.234
- Oh, you're sharp.

29:34.270 --> 29:35.340
- Yeah.

29:54.290 --> 29:58.227
(* Woman singing rock,
lyrics indistinct *)

30:04.130 --> 30:05.495
- Hey!

30:07.470 --> 30:08.835
We're better
than that.

30:08.870 --> 30:10.838
(Exhaling sharply)

30:14.110 --> 30:16.238
(Moaning)

30:38.400 --> 30:40.528
(Door closing)

30:42.400 --> 30:44.630
- Hey!

30:44.670 --> 30:46.399
That was a long run.

30:52.250 --> 30:55.447
- Nora, I'm--

30:55.480 --> 30:58.415
I'm sorry. I'm all
over the place.

31:00.450 --> 31:02.009
(Sighing)

31:02.060 --> 31:03.516
- I get that.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.528
That's what
I was trying to say.

31:05.560 --> 31:08.894
I don't think you're ready
to leave what we have here.

31:08.930 --> 31:10.159
(Sighing)

31:10.200 --> 31:12.396
Josh, what's going on?

31:14.600 --> 31:16.136
- Nora, I--

31:18.970 --> 31:20.529
- What? What?

31:20.570 --> 31:22.277
- Not a good time, man!

31:22.310 --> 31:24.244
- How long are you
planning on staying?

31:24.280 --> 31:26.442
- Until this place
stops reeking!

31:26.480 --> 31:28.517
I'm digging through the drains.

31:28.550 --> 31:30.177
Oh, before 1 forget,

31:30.220 --> 31:33.952
I know it's late, but there's
a couple that might stop by.

31:33.990 --> 31:36.152
So just come get me
if they show.

31:42.430 --> 31:46.094
- What's going on, Josh?

31:46.130 --> 31:48.064
I want the truth.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.600
(Doorbell buzzing)

31:52.640 --> 31:54.005
(Sighing)

31:54.040 --> 31:55.337
Seriously?

31:55.380 --> 31:56.370
(Sniffling)

31:56.410 --> 31:58.344
- I'll get it.

31:58.380 --> 32:01.611
They'll take one whiff of
this place and be on their way.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.417
(Josh groaning)

32:11.190 --> 32:12.453
(Wendy gasping)

32:18.430 --> 32:20.068
I was wrong.
I'm so sorry!

32:20.100 --> 32:22.398
- Not as sorry
as he's about to be.

32:22.440 --> 32:23.464
- It's not
his fault!

32:23.500 --> 32:25.468
- What's not
his fault? Stop!

32:25.510 --> 32:28.571
(Thudding and shouting
in distance)

32:28.610 --> 32:30.271
- Married people
are the worst!

32:30.310 --> 32:32.039
(* Muffled music
in headphones *)

32:32.080 --> 32:34.048
- Stop it!
- It was just our wolves!

32:34.080 --> 32:37.175
- What was just your wolves?
What's the hell's going on?

32:37.220 --> 32:38.415
- What do you think?

32:38.450 --> 32:40.316
Apparently,
Joshy Boy's wolf thought

32:40.350 --> 32:43.718
it would be OK to sleep with
my wife during the change!

32:43.760 --> 32:44.727
(Groaning)

32:44.760 --> 32:45.727
- What?

32:45.760 --> 32:47.455
- Nora, I'm so sorry!

32:47.490 --> 32:50.425
- Stop it!
Oh my God!

32:50.460 --> 32:52.189
Stop that now!

32:52.230 --> 32:53.720
(Nora grunting)

32:53.770 --> 32:55.329
- NORA!

32:55.370 --> 32:56.997
(Growling)

33:01.410 --> 33:04.072
ROk

33:10.780 --> 33:15.217
- No, stop it! Please!
Just stop it!

33:20.790 --> 33:22.155
(Crying)

33:26.130 --> 33:28.633
(Both exhaling sharply)

33:28.670 --> 33:31.139
(Both chuckling)

33:31.170 --> 33:36.301
- This--this is not how
I thought this night would end.

33:37.540 --> 33:39.599
- You needed
a distraction.

33:39.650 --> 33:40.742
- Oh, ha ha ha!

33:40.780 --> 33:42.179
(Giggling)

33:45.550 --> 33:49.214
- I wouldn't give you any
more blood even if I had it.

33:49.260 --> 33:51.126
- OK, OK, OK.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.481
- You can do this,
Aidan, you know?

33:53.530 --> 33:57.398
You're really close, and I can
talk you through the rest of it.

33:57.430 --> 33:58.397
- Really?

33:58.430 --> 33:59.500
- Yeah.

33:59.530 --> 34:02.136
- So I can end up
just like you, huh?

34:02.170 --> 34:05.561
So I can just go around
killing my own kind, huh?

34:05.610 --> 34:07.635
- Oh! Yes, like
you never have.

34:07.670 --> 34:08.705
- Yeah, I have,

34:08.739 --> 34:10.538
only when I've
had no choice.

34:10.580 --> 34:14.312
Look, you kill a human being,
it's awful, it's horrifying,

34:14.350 --> 34:15.715
but then there's a door.

34:15.750 --> 34:18.185
You kill one of us,
there's nothing,

34:18.219 --> 34:19.641
and that's
unconscionable.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.556
You want us to be
in this together?

34:21.590 --> 34:23.284
You want me
to quit blood?

34:23.320 --> 34:26.290
Well, then I want you
to quit what you're doing.

34:26.330 --> 34:28.389
- I'm doing work that
needs to be done, OK?

34:28.429 --> 34:29.726
I cannot change
every vampire,

34:29.760 --> 34:31.467
but I'd feel a hell
of a lot better

34:31.500 --> 34:34.435
if I knew at least some of them
didn't have to kill humans.

34:34.469 --> 34:36.837
- Then why don't you
let me be your test case?

34:36.870 --> 34:39.339
- Look at yourself,
You're not ready.

34:39.370 --> 34:41.839
<i>You're afraid of
what'| happen 10 you</i>

34:41.880 --> 34:43.574
if you lose
your roommates.

34:43.610 --> 34:45.442
- OK, that's fair,

34:45.480 --> 34:48.848
but all these years, I have been
clinging to a shred of humanity,

34:48.880 --> 34:51.315
the shred that
I lost when you died.

34:51.350 --> 34:55.355
Now, you, you've maintained
control. You have been strong.

34:55.389 --> 34:57.449
I'm ready to do
that too.

34:57.490 --> 35:00.187
I am. I need to.

35:00.230 --> 35:02.449
- Do you think
you're stronger than me?

35:02.500 --> 35:04.696
Please, you're faster, maybe.

35:04.730 --> 35:07.620
But if you slip,
I will be ruthless.

35:07.670 --> 35:11.868
- And if you kill again, I'm not
gonna protect you anymore.

35:11.910 --> 35:15.778
- Well, I guess we have
to try, then, don't we?

35:35.960 --> 35:37.655
- How can you
live in a house

35:37.700 --> 35:39.896
that has a Saw kill room
for a basement.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.194
- Why are you so mean?

35:42.240 --> 35:44.800
What is so wrong with me
that you feel the need

35:44.840 --> 35:47.662
to cut me down all the time?

35:47.710 --> 35:49.371
- It's not you.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.606
I just feel like
I'm the only one

35:51.650 --> 35:54.415
who sees this place
for what it really is.

35:54.450 --> 35:56.817
I mean, somebody's
gotta be realistic.

35:56.850 --> 35:59.387
- Yeah, it's always
been your strong suit.

35:59.420 --> 36:02.390
- Look, you tell me that this
is what you really want,

36:02.420 --> 36:03.751
and I'll back off.

36:03.790 --> 36:06.259
I just don't believe it is.

36:06.290 --> 36:10.420
- I've never been more sure
about anything in my life.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.531
- I guess I'll just stop
getting In your way.

36:18.740 --> 36:21.437
It's cool. I got some
buddies in Seattle

36:21.480 --> 36:23.437
that need help
with a startup.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.800
Thing's gonna be huge.

36:26.580 --> 36:28.275
Guess I better get going.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.414
- Yeah, you should.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.779
- Yeah.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.300
I'm S O SO I ry I

36:43.330 --> 36:46.925
I wasn't gonna tell you.
I knew it would only hurt you.

36:46.970 --> 36:48.836
- Being lied to
feels great.

36:48.870 --> 36:50.338
- I screwed up, OK?

36:50.370 --> 36:53.704
But it was during a turn.
I didn't want it to happen!

36:53.740 --> 36:56.437
- On some level, you did.
- No!

36:56.480 --> 36:58.949
- You said you're more
connected to your wolf now.

36:58.980 --> 37:00.869
Does that mean that
you made a choice?

37:00.910 --> 37:03.311
- None of what I am now
was a choice, Nora!

37:03.350 --> 37:05.682
- All this "let's get
out of Boston,"

37:05.720 --> 37:08.587
live like we're in the
Sunday style section.

37:08.620 --> 37:09.849
- Please stop. No.

37:09.890 --> 37:11.619
- It was all just
you covering.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.583
- No, I want
those things too!

37:13.630 --> 37:15.428
I'm not--
Listen, listen.

37:15.460 --> 37:17.690
You know I'm not
that kind of guy!

37:17.730 --> 37:19.824
- But you are that
kind of wolf!

37:19.870 --> 37:20.962
- No, I'm not!

37:21.000 --> 37:22.331
- Your wolf is winning!

37:23.900 --> 37:25.629
Has he already won?

37:25.670 --> 37:28.605
- No! This will
never happen again.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.836
- How can I believe you?

37:30.880 --> 37:32.974
Is that what
it was like,

37:33.010 --> 37:34.739
when you got jumped?

37:34.780 --> 37:37.442
You would've
killed him, Josh.

37:37.480 --> 37:38.515
- No, no.

37:38.550 --> 37:40.484
- I saw 1t in
your eyes!

37:40.520 --> 37:41.612
- No, no.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.515
- And you said
you liked it.

37:43.560 --> 37:45.050
You liked
feeling strong.

37:45.090 --> 37:47.354
That was not strength
or control!

37:47.390 --> 37:49.893
That was a vicious killer!

37:51.100 --> 37:53.023
I see that now.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.329
Do you?

37:57.540 --> 37:59.360
(Nora sobs)

37:59.410 --> 38:02.675
Let me know when you're ready
to do something about it,

38:02.710 --> 38:07.272

I can't do this anymore.
