Tonight, we throw a chair over a hedge

00:15.728 --> 00:19.332
A quite interesting man drives a reasonable price car  

00:19.528 --> 00:25.432
And, for the first time ever the Bugatti Veyron races the McLaren F1.

00:31.872 --> 00:34.484
Thank you, everybody, thank you!

00:34.672 --> 00:36.884
Hello, Hello and Welcome!

00:37.000 --> 00:38.000
Noisy

00:39.872 --> 00:48.384
Now, every year 50.000 17-year old past a driving test and have to by a car, ok?

00:48.524 --> 00:53.332
Because the seventeen the car they want: a sporty cool and preferee turbocharged.

00:53.872 --> 00:59.300
Trouble is, their parents want them- to have something that is slow, cheap and safe.

00:59.340 --> 01:02.520
And the insurance companies would rather they didn't have anything at all.

01:02.560 --> 01:06.628
So, to sort all this out, the producers gave us each a typical budget of £2,500,

01:06.668 --> 01:09.116
told us to pretend we were 17-year-olds

01:09.156 --> 01:12.720
and then go out there and buy cars that would please us as 17-year-olds,

01:12.760 --> 01:15.912
our parents and the man from the Pru.

01:15.952 --> 01:20.036
This is genuine, genuine consumer advice. Well, mostly.

01:20.076 --> 01:23.928
Sort of. At first.

01:23.968 --> 01:26.284
There are any number of cars on offer these days

01:26.324 --> 01:28.284
for that kind of budget -

01:28.324 --> 01:32.768
even this 1997 BMW 7 Series.

01:32.808 --> 01:36.532
Great car, ABS, air bag, so it's safe in a crash.

01:36.572 --> 01:41.988
Parents will love it for this reason. And kids'll love it cos, well, it's cool.

01:52.200 --> 01:55.116
7,000 what? Pounds?!

01:55.156 --> 01:58.020
I've been very sensible here. Look at this. I've found a Suzuki Liana,

01:58.060 --> 02:01.332
which is small, sturdy, safe... Yeah.

02:01.372 --> 02:05.988
£1,300... Yeah. Gives me £1,200 to spend. What, on insurance? Yep.

02:06.028 --> 02:09.127
That won't be enough. £1,200, I guarantee it won't be enough.

02:09.168 --> 02:10.912

James May. No, Adam Smith, sorry.

02:40.468 --> 02:46.208
£2,500 is 15 times more than the car is worth.

02:46.248 --> 02:54.740
No, but what you're saying is I'm going to write it off completely 15 times a year.

02:54.780 --> 03:00.332
Premiums for 17-year-old girls are half what they are for 17-year-old boys. Seriously

03:00.372 --> 03:02.240
Premiums for 17-year-old girls are half what they are for 17-year-old boys. Seriously

03:02.280 --> 03:04.960
Half the money. Well, there's a Top Gear top tip right there.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.084
If you're a 17-year-old boy and you need car insurance, slice your penis off.

03:07.124 --> 03:09.680

05:00.864 --> 05:03.868
It's a coupe! It's magnificent. 85bhp,

05:03.908 --> 05:06.604
bucket seats, electric windows.

05:06.644 --> 05:09.808
How much was yours? Sorry, how much did your mum pay?

05:09.848 --> 05:14.024
My mum paid £700 for this.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.024
'And then...

05:15.064 --> 05:17.400
'a geography teacher arrived.'

05:29.988 --> 05:34.588
My turbo. Low pressure, I think. It is a low pressure turbo.

05:34.628 --> 05:38.620
What have you got? I've got a Golf.- Has it got a turbo? No.

05:38.660 --> 05:41.368
They did do a turbo... What is that?! A Hyundai S Coupe

05:41.408 --> 05:43.104
and they did do a turbo.

05:43.144 --> 05:48.076
Not on this one. not on this one. So, you turn up at the school, here's my turbo.

05:48.116 --> 05:52.480
There's another very important issue that we must address.

It's not from exactly the same model,

but it's close enough. And I've customised it to fit perfectly.

07:03.568 --> 07:08.464
With my budget of £0, I'd fitted a girl-enticing water bed in the back.

07:08.504 --> 07:13.028
Well, when I say water bed, what I mean is... Well, it's a lilo.

07:13.068 --> 07:17.088
But to enliven it a bit, I've teamed it with a leopard-skin throw

07:17.128 --> 07:20.764
and shag-pile carpet, which is more a sort of a bath mat.

07:20.804 --> 07:27.904
And then, to finish it all off, some simple, hand-painted turbo motifs.

07:30.864 --> 07:34.652

Cos there wasn't. So you were just being pedantic?

13:25.360 --> 13:30.368
No, I was being correct. He was anticipating an emergency stop, not an argument, you fool! Was he?

13:30.408 --> 13:33.384
Yeah, that's it. Actually... What? While we're on the subject,

13:33.424 --> 13:38.400
at the other end of the scale from our failure, you turned up with some scissors in your pocket,

13:38.440 --> 13:40.804
ready to cut your L-plates off the car.

13:40.844 --> 13:43.680
True. It's optimistic. I didn't see it as a driving test,

13:43.720 --> 13:45.728
so much as a confirmation of my excellence.

13:45.768 --> 13:47.584
LAUGHTER

13:47.624 --> 13:50.868
That's really what it was. When he said, the man,

13:50.908 --> 13:54.276
whatever he was - the instructor...- Examiner. ..examiner - when he said,

13:54.316 --> 13:57.320
"Congratulations, Mr Clarkson, you've passed,"

13:57.360 --> 14:03.692
what I heard was, "Congratulations,- Mr Clarkson, you are the best driver I've ever seen in my life."

14:03.732 --> 14:07.008
You can imagine my surprise 36 hours later to find myself in a field,

14:07.048 --> 14:12.884
surrounded by sheep that were no longer alive and bits of what used to be my mum's Audi.

14:12.924 --> 14:17.384
"How did this happen?! I'm the best driver in the world and I've gone and stuffed it!"

14:17.424 --> 14:21.460
Right, can we now do the news? Last week, we were talking about the Government's scrappage scheme,

14:21.500 --> 14:24.488
which is important and we got distracted

14:24.528 --> 14:29.696
by talking about playing croquet with tortoises. Dead tortoises.

14:29.736 --> 14:33.884
We mustn't do that again, because the scrappage scheme genuinely is important.

14:33.924 --> 14:39.148
To prop up the car industry, the Government is encouraging you to scrap old cars and buy new ones.

14:39.188 --> 14:41.960
The trouble is that the cars people- are buying are Korean,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.868
which means the Government is using our money

14:44.908 --> 14:50.368
to help Kim Jong-il buy nuclear weapons.

14:50.408 --> 14:54.132
That's the wrong bit of Korea. Don't be so pedantic!

14:54.172 --> 14:57.916
It's hardly pedantic, Jeremy. One is a free market economy making- a harmless hatchback

14:57.956 --> 15:03.072
the other is a totalitarian regime,- allegedly making weapons of mass destruction.

15:03.112 --> 15:07.928
When a nuclear bomb drops on your house, don't come crying to me about your distinctions.

15:07.968 --> 15:11.480
Why would the South Koreans nuke Hammersmith?

15:11.520 --> 15:13.320
They use American guidance systems?

15:13.360 --> 15:15.256
LAUGHTER

15:15.296 --> 15:19.132
We're going off-topic again! Can we get back?! Yes. Get back to the scrappage scheme.

15:19.172 --> 15:22.996
This is an important point. It is more ecological - and this is a fact,

15:23.036 --> 15:27.152
the Green Party agree with us ONLY on this point -

15:27.192 --> 15:30.560
it's more ecological to keep an old car going

15:30.600 --> 15:34.528
than it is to scrap it, throw it away and build a new one. True fact.

15:34.568 --> 15:39.336
If you've got an old car - we really are on-topic here -

15:39.376 --> 15:42.528
if you've got an old car, it has to be serviced by someone.

15:42.568 --> 15:44.900
That someone is going to be under an arch at the end of your road,

15:44.940 --> 15:47.356
and not Kim Jong-il. LAUGHTER

15:47.396 --> 15:51.056
Now, you know the Ariel Atom? Yes. You drove one last year. Yes. When you stepped out of it,

15:51.096 --> 15:54.008
did you think, "Bit slow"? No, I didn't.

15:54.048 --> 15:58.544
Everyone had said it's superbike fast and I thought, "Oh, come on, don't be ridic...argh!"

15:58.584 --> 16:03.528
It's insanely fast. That one had a supercharged 4-cylinder Honda engine out of a Civic, yes? Yes.

16:03.568 --> 16:07.872
They've now come up with this, which has a supercharged V8 engine.

16:07.912 --> 16:10.776
They're saying it's got more than 500 horsepower

16:10.816 --> 16:13.400
and the car weighs less than half a tonne.

16:13.440 --> 16:17.824
So that is more than 1,000 horsepower per tonne.

16:17.864 --> 16:22.744
That's just staggering. A Bugatti Veyron, to put that in perspective,- is 521bhp per tonne,

16:22.784 --> 16:26.416
so it's nearly twice as powerful. It'll be too fast to see.

16:26.456 --> 16:31.744
It'll be there, then not there. There'll be a thin film of what was- the clutch on the road.

16:31.784 --> 16:35.056
It's £100,000, but I don't believe cars can get better than that.

16:35.096 --> 16:39.008
What if you're an antique dealer? That'll be limiting for... It's not.

16:39.048 --> 16:41.356
That's what this is on the back for.

16:41.396 --> 16:46.088
You strap wardrobes, chests of drawers on there and... They've thought about it. See?

16:46.128 --> 16:50.212
You know Vauxhall? Yes. Canadian company now.

16:50.252 --> 16:53.560
Vauxhall has done a supercharged version of the VXR8.

16:53.600 --> 16:56.104
Here it is - it's called the Bathurst.

16:56.144 --> 17:00.952
That makes the worst noise... What?! It makes the best noise!

17:00.992 --> 17:06.448
The supercharger, that screech! It's brilliant. The mechanical whine... It's deafening!

17:06.488 --> 17:10.308
It's like driving along - what's that opera singer called - Katherine...er...Jenkins!

17:10.348 --> 17:15.608
It's like her having what DH Lawrence would've called a "crisis".

17:15.647 --> 17:18.000
A what? A crisis.

17:18.040 --> 17:20.684
Lady Chatterley, goes in the barn with the gardener, in the hay,

17:20.723 --> 17:24.232
some things happen, then she has a "crisis". Oh!

17:24.271 --> 17:28.076
A crisis...yes. That's what it sounds like, a constant Victorian crisis.

17:28.116 --> 17:32.624
That's my point, it's a brilliant noise. The supercharger whine is a mechanical driving sound.

17:32.664 --> 17:35.888
That does make other brilliant noises. No, the best noise

17:35.928 --> 17:41.280
made by any car is my Mercedes - which is now only 19 days away from- its first service,

17:41.320 --> 17:44.292
so the cooler will be mine in 19 days, right -

17:44.332 --> 17:50.904
but that, between about 2,750 and 3,500 revs on three-quarter throttle,

17:50.944 --> 17:52.796
that is the best noise in the world.

17:52.836 --> 17:54.232
I thought... What?

17:54.272 --> 17:59.876
..the best noise that had ever come- out of a car came out of the stereo- in my 17-year-old Golf

17:59.916 --> 18:02.292
until you two touched it inappropriately.

18:02.332 --> 18:05.344
LAUGHTER

18:05.384 --> 18:07.652
Actually, while we're on the subject of this,

18:07.692 --> 18:07.920
last week, James did talk about touching people inappropriately

18:07.960 --> 18:18.372
and the Daily Star, in an editorial, says that we've upset the Scouts and the Catholic Church

18:18.412 --> 18:21.796
and that we can add those two august organisations

18:21.836 --> 18:25.688
to other people we've offended, including lorry drivers, Scots, Malaysians,

18:25.728 --> 18:30.264
Germans, blind people, anti-hunt protesters and smokers.

18:30.304 --> 18:36.640
I'm sorry, but this sort of gutter press claptrap gets so far up my nose.

18:36.680 --> 18:41.888
How dare they? How dare they suggest that we would be rude to smokers?!!

18:41.928 --> 18:44.516
LAUGHTER

18:44.556 --> 18:46.640
That is the end of the news.

18:46.680 --> 18:50.640
Now, at this point, Jeremy usually rushes off to drive a car very quickly around our track.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.596
This week, it was my turn

18:52.636 --> 18:57.672
and I thought, "Why just do it at the track?"

18:57.712 --> 18:59.296
WIND HOWLS

18:59.336 --> 19:08.560
HOOFBEATS

19:08.600 --> 19:10.936
Arabia. Visitors here get all misty-eyed about camp fires

19:10.976 --> 19:13.408
in the sands of time, and you can see why.

19:13.448 --> 19:21.032
But the truth is, the place is shot- through with a love of speed...

19:21.072 --> 19:26.316
'..which means it's the perfect place to go for a run in this -

19:26.356 --> 19:33.424
'the brand-new Lamborghini Murcielago.'

19:33.464 --> 19:36.876
Over there is downtown Abu Dhabi.

19:36.916 --> 19:41.048
Between me and it is a four-mile, arrow-straight stretch of highway.

19:41.088 --> 19:43.360
ENGINE REVS

19:43.400 --> 19:45.392
And...it's closed.

19:45.432 --> 19:49.296
How lucky is that?

19:49.336 --> 19:53.888
TYRES SQUEAL

19:53.928 --> 19:58.956
Oh, what a noise!

19:58.996 --> 20:00.984
140.

20:01.024 --> 20:03.392
150.

20:03.432 --> 20:06.800
160.

20:06.840 --> 20:10.704
170mph.

20:10.744 --> 20:16.128
Whoa!

20:16.168 --> 20:24.936
Whoa. You've just met the Lamborghini Murcielago LP670-4 SV,

20:24.976 --> 20:30.688
or, to put it in plain English... the fastest Lamborghini ever made.

20:30.728 --> 20:34.812
'It's also the last Murcielago that'll ever be made,

20:34.852 --> 20:40.472
'because a brand-new replacement is coming next year.

20:40.512 --> 20:45.316
'But rest assured that the old one won't be going quietly,

20:45.356 --> 20:52.832
'because from every angle, this last hurrah looks absolutely evil.'

20:52.872 --> 20:54.704
GROWLING

20:54.744 --> 20:57.520
I mean, just look at that exhaust.

20:57.560 --> 21:09.268
If a Toyota Prius came up behind and saw that, it would wet its pants.

21:09.308 --> 21:14.532
'So, LP670-4 SV.'

21:14.572 --> 21:21.240
The SV stands for Sport Veloce, something they've tagged their hardcore models since the Miura.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.080
The "4" is the 4-wheel drive.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.880
The LP stands for...something.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.892
The 670 is the horsepower, which is 30 more than the last one

21:31.932 --> 21:37.128
and also, quite a lot.

21:37.168 --> 21:42.504
'And whilst they've added power, they've also been busy stripping away weight.'

21:42.544 --> 21:45.848
It's 100kg lighter than the standard car.

21:45.888 --> 21:50.504
It's got a lighter exhaust system, more of it's made of carbon fibre

21:50.544 --> 21:56.488
and it does all add up, because the results are astonishing.

21:56.528 --> 22:00.328
0-60, 3.2 seconds.

22:00.368 --> 22:04.284
Top speed, 212mph.

22:04.324 --> 22:09.020
'They've also taken away the radio,- but that's fine by me.'

22:09.060 --> 22:13.488
Because that noise...

22:13.528 --> 22:16.880
That glorious noise!

22:16.920 --> 22:20.756
This V12 has basically been around since the Miura

22:20.796 --> 22:23.428
and it too will die along with this car.

22:23.468 --> 22:26.552
And it is just as if it's howling,

22:26.592 --> 22:33.848
"You'll miss me when I'm gone!"

22:33.888 --> 22:40.224
'And I'm not the only one who thinks this car has a human soul.'

22:40.264 --> 22:43.348
All car-makers release official info with every new car

22:43.388 --> 22:46.348
and, usually, this stuff is pretty dry.

22:46.388 --> 22:49.600
Here's Mercedes talking about the exhaust on the SL Black.

22:49.640 --> 22:53.568
They say, "The new design reduces exhaust gas backpressure.

22:53.608 --> 22:56.224
"The acoustic side effect of this is to produce

22:56.264 --> 22:59.288
"a distinctive 12-cylinder sound from the two trapezoidal tailpipes."

22:59.328 --> 23:04.816
By contrast, here's Lamborghini's latest info. They say that this exhaust, in this car,

23:04.856 --> 23:09.568
makes a sound that ranges from, "the heavy rumble of a stormy night,

23:09.608 --> 23:15.008
"through the trumpeting of mighty elephants, to the roar of a raging lion."

23:15.048 --> 23:24.648
You just get the sense that before this car dies, they actually wanted- to make it come to life.

23:24.688 --> 23:27.944
They've certainly done that.

23:27.984 --> 23:32.128
It isn't just a lighter, faster Murcielago - the weight loss

23:32.168 --> 23:37.084
has transformed it into a completely different car.

23:37.124 --> 23:40.332
The steering is just so sharp,

23:40.372 --> 23:43.240
the brakes so effective.

23:43.280 --> 23:46.664
Don't get me wrong, it's still a big, scary car,

23:46.704 --> 23:52.208
but it's so light and nimble on its feet. Sand!

23:52.248 --> 23:57.820
Yeah, this'd be a lot easier if the desert would stay still.

23:57.860 --> 24:00.804
'The price for this outrageous curtain-call?

24:00.844 --> 24:05.240
'£270,000.'

24:05.280 --> 24:07.744
Actually, that's quite cheap.

24:07.784 --> 24:10.288
It is!

24:10.328 --> 24:16.428
'Because I think this thing can run- not just with mere supercars...

24:16.468 --> 24:23.336
'..but with the more rarefied and expensive hypercars.'

24:23.376 --> 24:25.288
There it is!

24:25.328 --> 24:32.788
That's an SLR 722 - like an SLR, only more.

24:32.828 --> 24:36.868
That is hypercar royalty, right there.

24:36.908 --> 24:40.208
'So, since we still have the roads to ourselves,

24:40.248 --> 24:43.492
'let's see if the 722 can keep its royal status

24:43.532 --> 24:46.024
'in a race between the lights.'

24:46.064 --> 24:51.492
I think it's got what it takes. Let's find out.

24:51.532 --> 24:54.896
ENGINES REV

24:54.936 --> 24:57.208
TYRES SQUEAL

24:57.248 --> 25:02.808
This is it! Come on, little Lambo!

25:02.848 --> 25:04.896
Ah-ha-ha!

25:04.936 --> 25:06.772
Try that on, fella.

25:06.812 --> 25:08.400
160.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.560
170 through the centre of Abu Dhabi. Hello!

25:11.600 --> 25:13.524
Ohhh!

25:13.564 --> 25:18.152
He's ahead but only just!

25:18.192 --> 25:20.616
Man, this is close!

25:20.656 --> 25:27.432
It's close!

25:27.472 --> 25:29.948
Red light!

25:29.988 --> 25:33.744
Whoa! Braking up to the red light quite hard.

25:33.784 --> 25:35.336
RICHARD LAUGHS

25:35.376 --> 25:39.024
That is a truly ridiculous game.

25:39.064 --> 25:41.524
It was unbelievably close.

25:41.564 --> 25:45.280
I was there, alongside hypercar royalty. Compared to that,

25:45.320 --> 25:48.152
this is a snotty little ragamuffin.

25:48.192 --> 25:51.212
And that's a hundred grand more than this.

25:51.252 --> 25:54.024
Quite a swan song.

25:54.064 --> 25:56.336
'Yep, in its dying moments,

25:56.376 --> 26:05.872
'the Murcielago has become one of the all-time supercar greats.'

26:05.912 --> 26:10.088
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

26:10.128 --> 26:19.168
There's some evidence on these seats that you had a crisis.

26:19.208 --> 26:20.588
But it's magnificent.

26:20.628 --> 26:21.840
It's such a...

26:21.880 --> 26:23.088
It's such a pantomime car and the best thing is,

26:23.128 --> 26:25.744
underneath the exterior there is a serious actor trying to get out.

26:25.784 --> 26:27.512
It can really do the job.

26:27.552 --> 26:31.648
Thing is though, you've always said- that your favourite supercar is the Zonda F, OK?

26:31.688 --> 26:34.648
So, which would you choose?

26:34.688 --> 26:36.840
Oh, no that's cru...that's...uh.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.436
Come on. That's like asking me to choose between my children.

26:39.476 --> 26:40.744
Come on!

26:40.784 --> 26:42.088
No, the only way to sort this out

26:42.128 --> 26:45.152
is to see how fast this is round the track.

26:45.192 --> 26:46.932
Speaking of which...

26:46.972 --> 26:51.592
Last week a man came here claiming to be The Stig.

26:51.632 --> 26:52.904
LAUGHTER

26:52.944 --> 26:54.076
You may have seen it, OK?

26:54.116 --> 26:55.640
Now, maybe he is, we don't know.

26:55.680 --> 26:56.948
OK, maybe he is.

26:56.988 --> 27:01.592
But what we do know is that he set a time of 1 minute 10 seconds in a Ferrari FXX round the track -

27:01.632 --> 27:03.620
top of our leader board.

27:03.660 --> 27:07.028
We subsequently discovered he was doing that on slick tyres.

27:07.068 --> 27:10.212
Now, we have rules on this Power Board here, OK.

27:10.252 --> 27:14.404
You can't use slicks, so this time is coming off.

27:14.444 --> 27:17.464
What? BOOING

27:17.504 --> 27:19.668
Oh, boo?! LAUGHTER

27:19.708 --> 27:21.872
This is a dictatorship.

27:21.912 --> 27:23.592
If you want to live in a democracy,- go to Iran.

27:23.632 --> 27:25.216
LAUGHTER

27:25.256 --> 27:27.684
I have to work with that, week in week out.

27:27.724 --> 27:29.776
It's now time to find out how fast this is round our track

27:29.816 --> 27:32.700
which means we must hand it over to our tame racing driver.

27:32.740 --> 27:34.872
Now some say that last week

27:34.912 --> 27:37.200
he was found in a locked room tied to a chair

27:37.240 --> 27:39.592
with German piano wire...

27:39.632 --> 27:41.872
LAUGHTER

27:41.912 --> 27:48.984
..And that this week, MPs turned him down for the job of Speaker.

27:49.024 --> 27:56.404
All we know is that's three things he has in common with Margaret Beckett.

27:56.444 --> 27:58.184
And he's off!

27:58.224 --> 28:00.856
Another similarity is, of course, very thin hair.

28:00.896 --> 28:05.012
Right, coming up to the first corner and he's coming in very hot.

28:05.052 --> 28:06.808
I had a go in this Lambo earlier,

28:06.848 --> 28:09.876
found a surprising amount of understeer.

28:09.916 --> 28:14.292
Stig seems to have it all under control at the moment though.

28:14.332 --> 28:16.088
Oh, good, no music again this week,

28:16.128 --> 28:20.028
because, as Richard said, the lightweight SV has no stereo

28:20.068 --> 28:24.088
but why would you want one with that V12 concerto behind you?

28:24.128 --> 28:28.060
Hammerhead. This is where understeer should rear its head.

28:28.100 --> 28:33.448
Look, at that, Stig neutralising it with 661 horses of fury!

28:33.488 --> 28:36.516
Brilliant driving!

28:36.556 --> 28:38.440
And the third thing, obviously,

28:38.480 --> 28:41.404
is a love of caravan holidays in the Dordogne.

28:41.444 --> 28:42.888
OK, there he is through the Follow Through.

28:42.928 --> 28:46.032
Stig says this car can be flighty

28:46.072 --> 28:49.156
so that's probably why he's lifted off through the tyres.

28:49.196 --> 28:52.048
That is incredible. OK, just two corners left.

28:52.088 --> 28:56.952
You can see Stiggy's little, possibly German paws working hard there.

28:56.992 --> 28:59.188
Spit of flame on the overrun,

28:59.228 --> 29:01.732
this car really is Widow Twankey with a wing.

29:01.772 --> 29:05.048
APPLAUSE

29:05.088 --> 29:07.780
Great lap but where does it go?

29:07.820 --> 29:09.984
Hammond, you have the time. I have the time.

29:10.024 --> 29:11.800
OK. Here we go.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.108
It did it in...

29:13.148 --> 29:16.000
1.19 dead!

29:16.040 --> 29:18.688
It has graduated up from supercar to hypercar.

29:18.728 --> 29:23.484
It's as fast as an Enzo! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

29:23.524 --> 29:24.640
It's moved up.

29:24.680 --> 29:27.216
That's...

29:27.256 --> 29:29.576
JEREMY CLEARS HIS THROAT Mind you...

29:29.616 --> 29:31.440
Zonda F.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.392
Yes, well, I guess we've got to let the board decide.

29:33.432 --> 29:35.720
It doesn't lie, the F's faster.

29:35.760 --> 29:36.888
So that's the one you'd choose still?

29:36.928 --> 29:38.812
Yes! OK, now...

29:38.852 --> 29:42.656
it is time to put a star in our reasonably-priced car.

29:42.696 --> 29:45.500
My guest tonight, he's just done everything really.

29:45.540 --> 29:49.344
He's the voice of the Harry Potter audiotapes, Blackadder,

29:49.384 --> 29:53.408
he's recently driven a taxi all the way around America.

29:53.448 --> 29:57.248
Started out in life, his career, with a "Laurie" so, in fact,

29:57.288 --> 30:00.016
the only thing we can be sure he hasn't done,

30:00.056 --> 30:01.984
is murder a prostitute.

30:02.024 --> 30:03.640
LAUGHTER

30:03.680 --> 30:05.520
Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Fry!

30:05.560 --> 30:10.720
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

30:10.760 --> 30:13.204
Thank you for coming back, have a seat.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.296
Hello, everybody. Hello.

30:15.336 --> 30:16.376
Wow.

30:16.416 --> 30:19.000
Where's the rest of you? Oh, gosh, well...

30:19.040 --> 30:21.768
I've never seen anything like it. Oh, you are kind.

30:21.808 --> 30:23.408
What you're really saying is

30:23.448 --> 30:26.532
you've never seen anything like itbefore when I was so grotesquely fat.

30:26.572 --> 30:29.172
You were a sizeable chap and now you are a rake.

30:29.212 --> 30:30.548
Oh, thank you.

30:30.588 --> 30:31.768
How much have you lost?

30:31.808 --> 30:33.488
Nearly six stone.

30:33.528 --> 30:34.832
Yeah, gasp. Thank you.

30:34.872 --> 30:40.608
APPLAUSE

30:40.648 --> 30:42.532
How?

30:42.572 --> 30:44.936
I started by walking a lot just every morning.

30:44.976 --> 30:46.812
LAUGHTER No, you're pulling that face,

30:46.852 --> 30:51.968
but walking is made magnificent by audio books.

30:52.008 --> 30:55.376
Just list all the books that you'venever read that you wanted to read.

30:55.416 --> 30:58.676
For example, I've just had Tim Robbins in my ear

30:58.716 --> 31:00.688
reading The Great Gatsby.

31:00.728 --> 31:03.720
It is about the supreme experience you can have.

31:03.760 --> 31:07.504
And you eat up the miles. Do you do your books in audio-book form?

31:07.544 --> 31:10.172
I have no idea. You would know, you'd remember.

31:10.212 --> 31:11.644
I've never read them out.

31:11.684 --> 31:13.376
Right. I mean you are the mo...

31:13.416 --> 31:16.048
I wonder if there is a single household in Britain

31:16.088 --> 31:18.488
that doesn't go to sleep at night

31:18.528 --> 31:21.784
without the sound of you wafting out of the children's bedrooms.

31:21.824 --> 31:23.676
Is it just me or is it every child goes...?

31:23.716 --> 31:26.080
I had a man shout at me,

31:26.120 --> 31:28.112
"My children go to bed with you."

31:28.152 --> 31:30.408
LAUGHTER

31:30.448 --> 31:32.940
It staggers me, you've managed to lose all this weight

31:32.980 --> 31:36.252
even though recently you spent how many months in America?

31:36.292 --> 31:39.688
Oh, yes - about eight or nine months- all told.

31:39.728 --> 31:43.172
You did a lot of driving, the whole- thing in your London taxi. Yeah.

31:43.212 --> 31:45.688
Nobody loses weight in America.

31:45.728 --> 31:48.004
You're right and that's what brought me to it.

31:48.044 --> 31:51.504
I finished the American thing last year

31:51.544 --> 31:56.584
and by about a month or twoafterwards I was at my full 21 stone.

31:56.624 --> 31:58.600
It's life on the road, the freeways

31:58.640 --> 32:01.300
and those truck stops and places just...

32:01.340 --> 32:03.660
You visited Detroit in your...

32:03.700 --> 32:08.376
I did. I actually went to the General Motors Headquarters

32:08.416 --> 32:11.284
and was taken round in a brand-new Cadillac by the designer.

32:11.324 --> 32:13.476
This was only about six months before

32:13.516 --> 32:16.080
General Motors was basically bankrupt.

32:16.120 --> 32:20.836
Yeah. And he said, "We're still the biggest automobile company in the world."

32:20.876 --> 32:24.756
He said, "All my life has led up to this, I've designed my own Cadillac."

32:24.796 --> 32:29.192
He grew up in a family who... His father worked in Ford.

32:29.232 --> 32:32.600
And when he went to college to do automotive design

32:32.640 --> 32:34.988
and he told his father he'd got a job,

32:35.028 --> 32:38.348
his father said, "That's great, son." He said, "..At GM."

32:38.388 --> 32:40.568
And his father didn't talk to him for two weeks.

32:40.608 --> 32:42.972
If he'd tried that in Australia! Oh, yes!

32:43.012 --> 32:45.648
In Australia they have pitched battles between fans of...

32:45.688 --> 32:50.444
Can you imagine here someone with a Vectra beating a Mondeo owner to death

32:50.484 --> 32:51.836
with a bat? LAUGHTER

32:51.876 --> 32:53.208
They're like that over there.

32:53.248 --> 32:54.864
Yeah.

32:54.904 --> 32:56.600
I've got to move on to this.

32:56.640 --> 32:57.768
Because you are a big fan of Twitter.

32:57.808 --> 32:59.680
Yes.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.380
I was reading it the other day

33:01.420 --> 33:03.040
when you said you'd got from Norwich to London

33:03.080 --> 33:07.708
in a time that was impossible if you hadn't driven in bus lanes.

33:07.748 --> 33:09.848
Yes, all right. I didn't say that.

33:09.888 --> 33:13.128
I didn't say it was impossible if I hadn't driven in bus lanes,

33:13.168 --> 33:15.724
others said, "You must have used bus lanes."

33:15.764 --> 33:17.804
It is illegal for me to drive in bus lanes.

33:17.844 --> 33:19.456
Even though you drive a taxi?

33:19.496 --> 33:21.160
I do drive a London taxi.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.364
Do you think, "I'm not going to go in that bus lane"?

33:23.404 --> 33:25.116
LAUGHTER

33:25.156 --> 33:27.568
I...sometimes...

33:27.608 --> 33:30.456
You read that thing, it says from seven till something.

33:30.496 --> 33:32.352
"Oh, well, that must be now."

33:32.392 --> 33:34.960
LAUGHTER My favourite as you drive down here,

33:35.000 --> 33:36.972
you'll see it on your way home,

33:37.012 --> 33:39.224
in Guildford it said there's a bus lane.

33:39.264 --> 33:42.568
And it says, "Buses and good vehicles only".

33:42.608 --> 33:45.176
It says "goods" but in my mind, I just think,

33:45.216 --> 33:48.008
"This a Mercedes. It's a good car."

33:48.048 --> 33:51.128
I can be at the track hours faster than everybody else.

33:51.168 --> 33:53.128
It's like ones that say, "access only".

33:53.168 --> 33:56.848
I want access through this!LAUGHTER

33:56.888 --> 33:58.288
Going back to Twitter, I'm fascinated

33:58.328 --> 34:00.320
you find the time to do that. Everything you do

34:00.360 --> 34:03.384
you tell, half a million people are now following you.

34:03.424 --> 34:06.052
Yes, it's become rather a large number.

34:06.092 --> 34:09.024
When it started it was a few thousand and it's grown and grown

34:09.063 --> 34:10.712
and now everybody knows about it.

34:10.752 --> 34:11.744
I don't Twitter, obviously,

34:11.784 --> 34:13.384
but the thing we do share is a love

34:13.424 --> 34:16.208
of a specific type of mobile telephone.

34:16.248 --> 34:20.148
Yes, we stroke it, we love it, it has applications that are astonishing.

34:20.188 --> 34:22.600
OK, this application business -

34:22.639 --> 34:25.556
I've only recently been introduced to it.

34:25.596 --> 34:27.072
You told me about the one

34:27.112 --> 34:29.275
where you can play it as a reco... Have you got that?

34:29.315 --> 34:30.636
Yeah, oh yes, it's the...

34:30.676 --> 34:37.524
Ocarina's the one where you actually blow on it.

34:37.563 --> 34:38.760
And what's that other one?

34:38.800 --> 34:41.507
This one might not be quite so upyour strata but it's called Grindr.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.335
And this... AUDIENCE MEMBER LAUGHS

34:43.376 --> 34:44.928
Hello!

34:44.967 --> 34:45.868
LAUGHTER

34:45.908 --> 34:46.884
Over there.

34:46.924 --> 34:49.536
Who here knows what Grindr is, hands up.

34:49.576 --> 34:51.728
No-one's going to now. Who made that noise?

34:51.768 --> 34:54.583
Somebody must be next to the man that went "Huh-uh-uh!"

34:54.623 --> 34:55.583
It's...

34:55.623 --> 34:57.600
What is Grindr?

34:57.640 --> 34:59.088
It's basically a gay-cruising application.

34:59.128 --> 35:01.680
LAUGHTER

35:01.720 --> 35:03.276
When you load it...

35:03.316 --> 35:04.540
Get this, when you load it,

35:04.580 --> 35:07.256
up appear all kinds of faces and pictures

35:07.296 --> 35:11.088
and what's so amusing is, you press them and it goes like,

35:11.128 --> 35:13.412
"Hi, I'm Mike, hello..."

35:13.452 --> 35:16.164
and it tells you how close they are.- It says he's 20 yards away.

35:16.204 --> 35:18.928
No! Yeah! You can find the nearest,- cruising homosexual with that.

35:18.968 --> 35:19.996
LAUGHTER

35:20.036 --> 35:22.336
Yeah.

35:22.376 --> 35:24.368
Is there one...? Come on!

35:24.408 --> 35:26.288
Let's have a look.

35:26.328 --> 35:28.336
Who here...? Come on, Stephen, there must be one in here.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.132
I have to turn it on.

35:30.172 --> 35:32.180
Talk amongst yourselves for a moment.

35:32.220 --> 35:34.276
Anybody who's got Grindr turn it on.

35:34.316 --> 35:36.168
Let's see if anybody's got it.

35:36.208 --> 35:39.228
Just making sure mine isn't on. LAUGHTER

35:39.268 --> 35:41.244
I've got to get one of these. Imagine in traffic jams?

35:41.284 --> 35:44.368
LAUGHTER

35:44.408 --> 35:45.900
Here we are. Here's some...

35:45.940 --> 35:47.928
These are all homosexuals then? Yes.

35:47.968 --> 35:49.288
LAUGHTER

35:49.328 --> 35:51.996
You see... He's nine miles away, I'm afraid.

35:52.036 --> 35:54.132
Where is he nine miles away?

35:54.172 --> 35:56.664
We can drive there, I've got my Merc, we can get there in a jiffy!

35:56.704 --> 35:59.824
There's no-one near enough. There's nobody in this room?!

35:59.864 --> 36:02.324
Some of them show rude parts which you won't want to see.

36:02.364 --> 36:04.088
Bloody hell! JEREMY LAUGHS

36:04.128 --> 36:09.884
Now...

36:09.924 --> 36:12.760
It's a car show, I knew there was something.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.280
And of course you came down here to do a lap.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.040
Did you do it in your taxi?

36:17.080 --> 36:19.668
No, I drove in the reasonably-priced car.

36:19.708 --> 36:22.512
Am I allowed to reveal the truth? It's rather embarrassing,

36:22.552 --> 36:25.040
I drove in two reasonably-priced cars because the first one,

36:25.080 --> 36:28.888
I won't say I totalled it but...LAUGHTER

36:28.928 --> 36:32.232
I...I gave it a few bangs and it started dripping oil

36:32.272 --> 36:35.920
and we obviously thought that was not safe to have.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.028
Would anybody here like to see any of these bangs?

36:38.068 --> 36:40.200
AUDIENCE: Yes!

36:40.240 --> 36:43.368
Let's play this tape and see how you did in the sort of run-up.

36:43.408 --> 36:44.824
Let's have a look.

36:44.864 --> 36:48.008
It's the second-to-last corner. Yes! Oh, that's a high speed.

36:48.048 --> 36:50.212
Nice work(!) LAUGHTER

36:50.252 --> 36:51.808
Here's the second attempt...

36:51.848 --> 36:54.400
Held it...not held it.

36:54.440 --> 36:57.368
Yes, G-force is there.

36:57.408 --> 36:59.604
OK, there's a third attempt.

36:59.644 --> 37:01.948
Oh, BLEEP! LAUGHTER

37:01.988 --> 37:04.496
Well done, Stephen, brilliant! APPLAUSE

37:04.536 --> 37:09.416
That's courage!

37:09.456 --> 37:13.448
Every time, I said to myself, "Smoothly."

37:13.488 --> 37:15.840
What happens when I'm behind the wheel?

37:15.880 --> 37:19.324
"Argh!" It's just... And so I lost goodness knows how many seconds.

37:19.364 --> 37:21.856
I am so angry with myself but I had a great time.

37:21.896 --> 37:24.120
Who here would like to see Stephen's real lap?

37:24.160 --> 37:26.028
AUDIENCE: Yes!

37:26.068 --> 37:28.120
Good, let's have a look.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.592
That's a smoking start.

37:30.632 --> 37:32.728
This is going to be smooth.

37:32.768 --> 37:36.728
It might not be fast but let's make it smooth, Stephen, smooth.

37:36.768 --> 37:39.264
That's very good. Let's have a look...that's a smooth line.

37:39.304 --> 37:42.776
Perfect. That's the line The Stig teaches.

37:42.816 --> 37:46.368
With his... That's fantastic!

37:46.408 --> 37:48.872
Quite smooth, maybe too smooth.

37:48.912 --> 37:51.292
LAUGHTER

37:51.332 --> 37:54.416
A big dip there, that was heavy on the brakes.

37:54.456 --> 37:56.464
Possibly could have been heavier still, actually,

37:56.504 --> 37:58.480
because that's a bit of understeer.

37:58.520 --> 38:02.216
My word! It's hot too and I can't even claim it's wet

38:02.256 --> 38:09.516
except around my face! Ah!

38:09.556 --> 38:11.968
Hammerhead, this is the one that sorts out the men from the Grindrs.

38:12.008 --> 38:13.496
LAUGHTER

38:13.536 --> 38:16.044
That is bang-on, Stephen.

38:16.084 --> 38:19.876
Ah, you bitch. Oh, come on! LAUGHTER

38:19.916 --> 38:21.280
Here we go.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.060
That's quick, that's very good.

38:23.100 --> 38:24.448
Ah!

38:24.488 --> 38:28.516
You're having a crisis! LAUGHTER

38:28.556 --> 38:31.484
Here we go into the... Did he get it right this time?

38:31.524 --> 38:34.032
That is bang-on, cutting the corner nicely.

38:34.072 --> 38:37.168
Coming up to Gambon and...

38:37.208 --> 38:40.448
Yep, that just about kissed the apex and there we are, across the line!

38:40.488 --> 38:43.876
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Dear me!

38:43.916 --> 38:45.312
That was smooth.

38:45.352 --> 38:47.156
Oh, well, it was smooth.

38:47.196 --> 38:49.388
So...

38:49.428 --> 38:52.328
I'll give you the one. Oh, that's good.

38:52.368 --> 38:54.904
That means that you've beaten Jimmy- Carr, you've beaten Brian Cox.

38:54.944 --> 38:57.296
Who else do you think you beat?

38:57.336 --> 38:59.516
It would be nice to beat Michael Gambon,

38:59.556 --> 39:01.544
because that would put me between him and Jools.

39:01.584 --> 39:04.296
If I beat 1.50 it would be something- but I doubt I did.

39:04.336 --> 39:07.800
The problem is you were beautifully smooth

39:07.840 --> 39:10.656
but smoothness needs to be teamed with speed.

39:10.696 --> 39:13.236
Oh, no... And as a result,

39:13.276 --> 39:19.108
you had a very smooth but quite steady 1 minute 51 dead.

39:19.148 --> 39:21.440
Oh, no!APPLAUSE

39:21.480 --> 39:23.188
Oh!

39:23.228 --> 39:25.624
Well...

39:25.664 --> 39:27.216
I could give you a "hot".

39:27.256 --> 39:30.108
Give me a "hot". I wanted a "hot".

39:30.148 --> 39:32.672
I could give you a hot, it was a hot day and, of course,

39:32.712 --> 39:33.904
we on Top Gear are responsible for it.

39:33.944 --> 39:35.780
Is that Alan Davies? Alan...

39:35.820 --> 39:39.888
1.50.3, is that Alan D there? Alan Davies. I'll never hear the end of that.

39:39.928 --> 39:43.168
Do you know what? I could be guaranteed that Alan doesn't watch Top Gear.

39:43.208 --> 39:45.548
So, if you just go back and say, "I did 1.47..."

39:45.588 --> 39:48.248
LAUGHTER He'll never know.

39:48.288 --> 39:50.216
Ladies and gentleman, Stephen Fry!

39:50.256 --> 40:00.968
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

40:01.008 --> 40:02.752
Excellent.

40:02.792 --> 40:05.360
Now...

40:05.400 --> 40:07.720
Earlier on we bought, insured and customised three cars

40:07.760 --> 40:12.956
that we feel are ideal for 17-year-olds and their parents and the insurance companies.

40:12.996 --> 40:15.800
Yeah, I had a bit of a problem in the first challenge

40:15.840 --> 40:19.924
when I sort-of ripped the body kit off the back on my Hyundai.

40:19.964 --> 40:23.624
Yep. Jeremy broke the back window of his Volvo with an anarchy flag.

40:23.664 --> 40:25.564
It's a bit of a long story. Yeah.

40:25.604 --> 40:32.248
Anyway, coming up now is the most realistic challenge ever attempted on British television.

40:32.288 --> 40:34.080
It's something we've all done.

40:34.120 --> 40:36.392
We were told to turn up at our parents' house

40:36.432 --> 40:40.860
and get up the drive at three o'clock in the morning...

40:40.900 --> 40:45.800
three hours after we'd said we'd be in, without waking them up.

40:45.840 --> 40:49.472
The winner would be the one who could do it the most quietly.

40:49.512 --> 40:52.848
OWL HOOTS

40:52.888 --> 40:55.016
'At three o'clock the next morning,

40:55.056 --> 40:58.316
'the man with the decibelometer was in place.

40:58.356 --> 41:02.284
'And I was first to go.'

41:02.324 --> 41:05.608
Oh, God. Ugh!

41:05.648 --> 41:12.220
'Despite the odd squeak from me, things were going well.'

41:12.260 --> 41:15.608
Ugh!

41:15.648 --> 41:18.360
WHISPERS: Yeah, this is a professional job.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.892
What I'm doing is reversing the car in

41:20.932 --> 41:28.376
so that it hides the back and my mother won't see what I've done.

41:28.416 --> 41:32.192
Find out the noise.

41:32.232 --> 41:40.328
50.4 decibels, that's like custard rustling, absolutely soundless.

41:40.368 --> 41:45.284
'Then it was Jeremy's go with the big, heavy Volvo.'

41:45.324 --> 41:48.096
SHOUTING: Oh, for God's sake!

41:48.136 --> 41:49.532
Yeah, that would be him.

41:49.572 --> 41:51.348
Come on. Come on!

41:51.388 --> 41:54.520
Ugh! Oh, God!

41:54.560 --> 41:57.708
'Mercifully the drive finally levelled out.'

41:57.748 --> 42:04.784
Come on, you stupid lump of Swedish lead.

42:04.824 --> 42:09.628
Oh, my God!

42:09.668 --> 42:13.160
SMASHING GLASS

42:13.200 --> 42:25.880
THEY LAUGH

42:25.920 --> 42:28.020
I might get in trouble.

42:28.060 --> 42:30.440
Don't make too much noise, you'll wake them up, mate.

42:30.480 --> 42:31.944
Oh, my God!

42:31.984 --> 42:34.160
It's the anarchy flag.

42:34.200 --> 42:35.660
That's what did it! That's what did it.

42:35.700 --> 42:37.892
Say it was stolen by anarchists

42:37.932 --> 42:41.224
and they buried it in the summer house. Job done!

42:41.264 --> 42:45.380
'Jeremy decided it would be quieter- to drive out of the wreckage.'

42:45.420 --> 42:47.784
SMASHING GLASS

42:47.824 --> 42:50.504
Oh, no, no, no!

42:50.544 --> 42:54.600
Shhh!

42:54.640 --> 42:57.320
There's no damage!

42:57.360 --> 42:59.160
Well, I think that's maybe pushing it a bit.

42:59.200 --> 43:00.632
This...

43:00.672 --> 43:02.536
and there's quite a lot of damage there.

43:02.576 --> 43:04.096
An awful lot.

43:04.136 --> 43:06.476
'Hammond had possibly pipped me on this one.'

43:06.516 --> 43:08.896
What was yours? 50.4.

43:08.936 --> 43:10.116
50.4?

43:10.156 --> 43:12.176
66.1!

43:12.216 --> 43:14.816
My Mum and Dad, they didn't wake up.

43:14.856 --> 43:17.836
It's a good job they're heroin addicts.

43:17.876 --> 43:21.052
'Then it was my turn.'

43:21.092 --> 43:23.960
I can do it on the engine cos the engine's quiet.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.836
The interesting thing is what James

43:25.876 --> 43:28.456
would have been out doing till late as a teenager.

43:28.496 --> 43:32.084
How long does choir practice go on?

43:32.124 --> 43:34.836
I can't actually see where the drive goes.

43:34.876 --> 43:38.084
JEREMY CLEARS HIS THROAT What?

43:38.124 --> 43:42.332
Is that the controller...?! RICHARD LAUGHS

43:42.372 --> 43:45.052
Ready, steady and...

43:45.092 --> 43:54.428
LOUD TECHNO MUSIC For God's sake! No!

43:54.468 --> 43:59.520
You're so unfunny.

43:59.560 --> 44:01.400
God above!

44:01.440 --> 44:03.960
'James had lost this challenge...

44:04.000 --> 44:07.896
'quite badly.' JEREMY AND RICHARD LAUGH

44:07.936 --> 44:09.208
Shall we go in and go to bed?

44:09.248 --> 44:10.148
Hold it! Hold it!

44:10.188 --> 44:11.304
Right, wait.

44:11.344 --> 44:16.412
Can you smell smoke on my fingers? THEY LAUGH

44:16.452 --> 44:21.276
The following morning, we were told- to report to our test track for the- next challenge.

44:21.316 --> 44:26.584
Oddly though, the man in the white coat was nowhere to be seen.

44:26.624 --> 44:28.148
What was the actual colour of your car?

44:28.188 --> 44:29.304
Red, it actually...

44:29.344 --> 44:31.648
No, no! Amber gold.

44:31.688 --> 44:34.648
Oh... Amber gold. Can you remember the exact colour of yours?

44:34.688 --> 44:36.616
Sunrise yellow.

44:36.656 --> 44:46.208
Lads!

44:46.248 --> 44:49.928
This man's destroying your Volvo. Are you going to sort him out?

44:49.968 --> 44:53.744
'The psychopath with the forklift then did the same to my Golf

44:53.784 --> 44:55.840
'and Hammond's Hyundai.'

44:55.880 --> 44:57.052
Ah!

44:57.092 --> 45:01.600
Mind the body kit!

45:01.640 --> 45:03.868
This does feel like a terrible...

45:03.908 --> 45:06.664
Well, hopefully... This had better be good.

45:06.704 --> 45:11.276
Ha-ha, "As you are 17, it is certain that at some point in the near future,

45:11.316 --> 45:13.868
"you will roll your car.

45:13.908 --> 45:17.056
"So, you must now mend it in such a way

45:17.096 --> 45:20.648
"that your parents won't be able to spot the damage.

45:20.688 --> 45:26.180
"This is to find out how easy they are to repair."

45:26.220 --> 45:29.524
Right, well we'd better get these... Let's get them indoors... Yeah.

45:29.564 --> 45:34.868
..and break out the hammers.

45:34.908 --> 45:38.524
'Richard, however, decided he didn't need a hammer.'

45:38.564 --> 45:42.152
And straightaway, I've improved it.

45:42.192 --> 45:43.228
God, a horse of a...ah!

45:43.268 --> 45:45.648
Ah! Argh!

45:45.688 --> 45:48.508
You don't need hammers and shouting.

45:48.548 --> 45:51.616
See this bit here, small scuff,

45:51.656 --> 45:56.680
watch that disappear thanks to the magic of polish.

45:56.720 --> 46:00.184
'With the roof done, I now have to sort the bonnet.'

46:00.224 --> 46:05.308
Here's a tip. Should you ever roll,- your coupe, stylish,

46:05.348 --> 46:13.716
and need to straighten a dent, here's what you do.

46:13.756 --> 46:16.356
That's not...ugh!

46:16.396 --> 46:20.040
'Jeremy, meanwhile, was cheating.'

46:20.080 --> 46:25.928
One thing I've learned is that all firemen have at some point crashed their cars when they were teenagers.

46:25.968 --> 46:29.368
So, I've borrowed a fireman. Did you ever crash a car?

46:29.408 --> 46:30.680
I certainly did.

46:30.720 --> 46:34.104
You were 17? RS Turbo, straight through a fence.

46:34.144 --> 46:38.104
So you understand the plight of the 17-year-old who's stuffed his Mum's car.

46:38.144 --> 46:41.136
Feeling the pain.

46:41.176 --> 46:47.904
So, do you think you could use some fireman equipment to make that like new?

46:47.944 --> 46:50.448
That's not what they're for.

46:50.488 --> 46:52.888
There were no fires in Surrey -

46:52.928 --> 46:57.604
it's too middle class.

46:57.644 --> 47:00.212
Spray it the same colour as the car.

47:00.252 --> 47:03.336
'After just two hours of hard work...'

47:03.376 --> 47:05.932
It's very important to turn the cloth frequently.

47:05.972 --> 47:09.776
'..we had made no difference whatsoever.'

47:09.816 --> 47:11.948
KNOCKING That's plastic.

47:11.988 --> 47:13.528
I had to do plastic too because

47:13.568 --> 47:16.696
the fireman's lift has changed the shape of the windscreen hole.

47:16.736 --> 47:19.200
'Then another challenge arrived.'

47:19.240 --> 47:22.776
Let's have a look.

47:22.816 --> 47:24.324
OK.

47:24.364 --> 47:27.964
"You will now race against the clock to see which car is the fastest.

47:28.004 --> 47:29.716
"You have to go down the main straight,

47:29.756 --> 47:31.264
"round the Hammerhead, do a handbrake turn

47:31.304 --> 47:33.640
"and come back the other way."

47:33.680 --> 47:35.856
That doesn't sound very hard.

47:35.896 --> 47:38.480
Oh, hang on, no, it says, "The track has been littered with obstacles

47:38.520 --> 47:43.216
"and you'll have five seconds added to your time for every object you don't hit."

47:43.256 --> 47:48.292
Don't hit? Well, that's what it says.

47:48.332 --> 47:49.560
'It was right.

47:49.600 --> 47:51.840
'The track was littered with all the flotsam

47:51.880 --> 47:54.920
'that teenagers like to crash into.

47:54.960 --> 47:59.856
'And then, at the finish line, there was a gap between two parked cars

47:59.896 --> 48:05.088
'that everyone, except a 17-year-old, can see isn't wide enough.

48:05.128 --> 48:07.028
'We also discovered that our handbrake turns

48:07.068 --> 48:10.464
'would be judged by three teenage girls.'

48:10.504 --> 48:12.776
That actually makes sense because as men,

48:12.816 --> 48:16.560
we know that nothing turns a 17-year-old girl on more

48:16.600 --> 48:19.528
than a good handbrake turn. God, yeah, fact.

48:19.568 --> 48:22.404
It's like a peacock has its plumage, those birds in the jungle,

48:22.444 --> 48:25.824
they attract a mate with dancing about. We have the handbrake.

48:25.864 --> 48:27.720
That's what it's for.

48:27.760 --> 48:29.372
I have no feathers... But I can do this!

48:29.412 --> 48:32.640
Interestingly, girls will always say, "No, we're not interested."

48:32.680 --> 48:34.328
Oh, they never show it!

48:34.368 --> 48:35.968
They never have ever shown it.

48:36.008 --> 48:39.028
They're suppressing it very well. Very effectively.

48:39.068 --> 48:41.496
'Armed with this new information about women,

48:41.536 --> 48:44.764
'James decided to get some practice...'

48:44.804 --> 48:46.420
TYRES SCREECH

48:46.460 --> 48:48.448
'..while we talked to the girls.'

48:48.488 --> 48:50.640
I've got a motorbike.

48:50.680 --> 48:52.732
That's nice. Yeah.

48:52.772 --> 48:54.624
Have you seen him? He's rubbish.

48:54.664 --> 48:58.608
I did one yesterday at Glastonbury and it was brilliant.

48:58.648 --> 49:00.296
And...

49:00.336 --> 49:02.516
Urgh!

49:02.556 --> 49:04.328
That's him being rubbish.

49:04.368 --> 49:06.080
I did a huge one.

49:06.120 --> 49:07.876
He just can't do it, he can't do it

49:07.916 --> 49:11.560
and he's got no penis cos it came off once.

49:11.600 --> 49:16.800
'With James cleared off the track, I lined up for the off.'

49:16.840 --> 49:19.404
Oh, that was a blinding start!

49:19.444 --> 49:21.828
What do you reckon his approach is going to be?

49:21.868 --> 49:23.704
Mmm... Fast. Violent.

49:23.744 --> 49:25.856
Oh, gotta hit this.

49:25.896 --> 49:28.528
Missed!

49:28.568 --> 49:31.000
Oh, that's the bus shelter, the bus shelter's good.

49:31.040 --> 49:35.168
This is like any 17-year-old coming home from work.

49:35.208 --> 49:37.484
He's got to the flower stall.

49:37.524 --> 49:42.204
My God! That's substantial. Yee-ha!

49:42.244 --> 49:44.516
That was strangely satisfying.

49:44.556 --> 49:47.392
Roadworks.

49:47.432 --> 49:50.296
That's good. Wheelie bins.

49:50.336 --> 49:52.316
Fantastic!

49:52.356 --> 50:00.000
'Sadly the handbrake turn was a disaster.'

50:00.040 --> 50:02.596
There's nothing I can do about the washer bottle,

50:02.636 --> 50:05.888
that is a consequence of the accident.

50:05.928 --> 50:08.424
Oh! That was still there!

50:08.464 --> 50:11.888
Holy cow, through we go!

50:11.928 --> 50:16.548
Yes!

50:16.588 --> 50:19.172
'James was next.'

50:19.212 --> 50:21.688
Yes, yes, do it!

50:21.728 --> 50:25.328
LOUD TECHNO MUSIC Oh, for God's sake.

50:25.368 --> 50:26.860
No!

50:26.900 --> 50:29.828
He's missed the car.

50:29.868 --> 50:31.596
Oh, neat!

50:31.636 --> 50:33.204
'Down the back straight it was hard to see

50:33.244 --> 50:36.860
'why he'd bothered with a helmet.'

50:36.900 --> 50:41.844
MUSIC: "Morning" by Grieg

50:41.884 --> 50:48.376
UPPER-CLASS ACCENT: Mum, I've been to the Post Office.

50:48.416 --> 50:55.532
'But then as he approached the girls, all became clear.'

50:55.572 --> 50:58.128
They're hot for James May right now!

50:58.168 --> 51:02.296
I might as well have cut my penis off for all the good that did.

51:02.336 --> 51:04.036
Good idea! Quick!

51:04.076 --> 51:08.452
I know what you're thinking, I want to do it too.

51:08.492 --> 51:09.752
There you go.

51:09.792 --> 51:15.204
WHISTLING Perfect.

51:15.244 --> 51:16.800
Yeah!

51:16.840 --> 51:18.328
Oh!

51:18.368 --> 51:19.988
That's not gone quite as well.

51:20.028 --> 51:23.608
'So now it was all down to me.'

51:23.648 --> 51:26.968
So they've both missed the car, the first obstacle. I won't.

51:27.008 --> 51:30.160
Go!

51:30.200 --> 51:32.456
Yeah, you see! Oh, yeah!

51:32.496 --> 51:35.360
35 seconds before he moved more than a yard.

51:35.400 --> 51:40.688
It's round the Hammerhead the normal way.

51:40.728 --> 51:45.756
Oh, what a pillock.

51:45.796 --> 51:50.376
You all right?

51:50.416 --> 51:51.756
Dead.

51:51.796 --> 51:54.036
Really? Yeah.

51:54.076 --> 51:56.784
Yeah. Anyway...uh...

51:56.824 --> 51:58.348
Back to the studio.

51:58.388 --> 51:59.688
That's my line!

51:59.728 --> 52:08.600
APPLAUSE

52:08.640 --> 52:11.628
Luckily, children, I got better.

52:11.668 --> 52:14.300
You might not be so lucky.

52:14.340 --> 52:17.440
Yes, it's like my penis. That grew back.

52:17.480 --> 52:20.848
Yours might not.

52:20.888 --> 52:22.880
Anyway...

52:22.920 --> 52:24.584
Let's have a look how we all did.

52:24.624 --> 52:28.320
No real surprises in the scoring until we get to the repair section

52:28.360 --> 52:30.068
where I got 2, Hammond got 4,

52:30.108 --> 52:32.520
James, you got -100.

52:32.560 --> 52:33.880
LAUGHTER Is that a minus?!

52:33.920 --> 52:35.488
It's a minus. Oh, come on!

52:35.528 --> 52:37.080
What did you expect? You failed to address

52:37.120 --> 52:40.240
the ruined bonnet, the crumpled roof,

52:40.280 --> 52:41.928
door mirror missing, all these dents.

52:41.968 --> 52:45.116
All you did was concentrate all your time on one scratch

52:45.156 --> 52:47.756
and it's still here! Look! LAUGHTER

52:47.796 --> 52:49.364
I ran out of time!

52:49.404 --> 52:52.756
You proved what I've said all along, polish doesn't work.

52:52.796 --> 52:54.612
It can't get rid of anything.

52:54.652 --> 52:57.208
When do you ever see the NHS go, "Oh, that's a nasty head wound,

52:57.248 --> 53:01.084
"We'll get some T-Cut on it." It doesn't get rid of anything!

53:01.124 --> 53:02.724
You ended up with a really clean scratch.

53:02.764 --> 53:04.116
Exactly!

53:04.156 --> 53:06.224
Let's move on. We've got the lap of crashes.

53:06.264 --> 53:08.476
Jeremy, you got 121.

53:08.516 --> 53:10.128
I got 103.

53:10.168 --> 53:14.600
Hammond, you got -174.

53:14.640 --> 53:19.680
Oh, what? So conveniently I just happen to get minus the number of points I have?

53:19.720 --> 53:21.364
Yes. Right. LAUGHTER

53:21.404 --> 53:24.288
There's no other words, you're on nought.

53:24.328 --> 53:26.160
OK, but now, now is the big one -

53:26.200 --> 53:28.664
the handbrake turn.

53:28.704 --> 53:35.708
Our teenage judges said they were prepared to award up to 5 points for a really good one.

53:35.748 --> 53:38.836
5 points? That means I can't possibly win.

53:38.876 --> 53:40.804
SQUEAKING No. What's your car doing?

53:40.844 --> 53:43.332
Can I just say, it can't stop that happening.

53:43.372 --> 53:44.556
LAUGHTER What happened was...

53:44.596 --> 53:47.240
You see the thing is, this got clobbered here,

53:47.280 --> 53:51.148
the headlight washer and it's blown- the fuse and that just is constant,

53:51.188 --> 53:53.456
it's been going on since we filmed it in March.

53:53.496 --> 53:56.148
Jeremy Clarkson, it is now between you and me. Yes, it is.

53:56.188 --> 53:59.352
Like last week, like the train So your handbrake turn... Yes.

53:59.392 --> 54:01.040
..what did it get?

54:01.080 --> 54:03.788
The girls awarded me...

54:03.828 --> 54:05.256
LAUGHTER

54:05.296 --> 54:07.692
..nothing!

54:07.732 --> 54:09.768
No poi... Why do you do that?

54:09.808 --> 54:12.928
Why can't you admit that you are turned on by handbrake turns?

54:12.968 --> 54:14.664
Just give in to it! Just go with it!

54:14.704 --> 54:16.556
You know this as a man.

54:16.596 --> 54:19.664
There's nothing else going for you.- No, come on!

54:19.704 --> 54:21.120
That is what does it.

54:21.160 --> 54:23.632
You think we're immature when we do them. Yeah.

54:23.672 --> 54:27.256
But you don't! Secretly... We do!

54:27.296 --> 54:28.600
You have a crisis.

54:28.640 --> 54:30.412
LAUGHTER

54:30.452 --> 54:32.788
I bet you when cars... I'm sorry.

54:32.828 --> 54:37.120
Can somebody... Can you just...?

54:37.160 --> 54:41.024
This is consumer advice as well. Shut up!

54:41.064 --> 54:45.176
This is also consumer advice... The door handle's come off!

54:45.216 --> 54:48.728
Can you go in there and make that noise please stop?

54:48.768 --> 54:50.788
Can you open the door?

54:50.828 --> 54:53.444
Just tu... Can you turn the key?

54:53.484 --> 54:55.692
Yes!

54:55.732 --> 54:59.692
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

54:59.732 --> 55:01.820
Oh, now that's...

55:01.860 --> 55:04.384
Come on, you're turned on now!

55:04.424 --> 55:05.320
LAUGHTER

55:05.360 --> 55:06.712
Anyway, I got nought? Yes.

55:06.752 --> 55:12.228
And that means you are now 3 points behind me.

55:12.268 --> 55:13.916
So if you got 4,

55:13.956 --> 55:15.896
the girls gave you 4...

55:15.936 --> 55:18.540
They did, didn't they? They did. What did they give you?

55:18.580 --> 55:20.400
Nothing.

55:20.440 --> 55:27.384
Yes! I am victorious! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

55:27.424 --> 55:29.320
Fairly beaten.

55:29.360 --> 55:33.680
Hold on! No, no, no.

55:33.720 --> 55:35.132
Think about it. Think what you're applauding,

55:35.172 --> 55:37.288
because what we're saying then is

55:37.328 --> 55:44.244
that the best, THE BEST car for a 17-year-old is a beige Volvo estate with a broken back window.

55:44.284 --> 55:46.808
Yep, that's what my children are getting.

55:46.848 --> 55:49.336
Anyway, that is the end, you'll be relieved to hear

55:49.376 --> 55:52.648
of the consumer advice for this week.

55:52.688 --> 55:54.560
No, no it's not because there is some more.

55:54.600 --> 55:57.244
Earlier on in the show, before I was...killed,

55:57.284 --> 56:00.540
I was in Abu Dhabi testing the new Lamborghini Murcielago

56:00.580 --> 56:04.772
and, in fact, I'm still there because now it's time for the moment

56:04.812 --> 56:07.808
petrolheads all over the world have been waiting for -

56:07.848 --> 56:18.288
the first-ever showdown between the- two fastest road cars of all time.

56:18.328 --> 56:21.152
This car, you're familiar with.

56:21.192 --> 56:26.464
The Bugatti Veyron, the Concorde of the road.

56:26.504 --> 56:30.604
The meeting point for the most amazing collection of numbers.

56:30.644 --> 56:32.416
One million pounds,

56:32.456 --> 56:34.808
one thousand horsepower

56:34.848 --> 56:42.464
and a top speed of 252 miles an hour.

56:42.504 --> 56:45.920
But spin the clock back 15 years and in the 1990s,

56:45.960 --> 56:49.668
this was the ultimate road car -

56:49.708 --> 56:54.368
the McLaren F1.

56:54.408 --> 56:58.648
Like the Bugatti, the McLaren is an orgy of mind-bending numbers.

56:58.688 --> 57:02.620
It was the fastest with a top speed- of 240 miles an hour.

57:02.660 --> 57:06.824
It was the most expensive, costing half a million pounds in 1993

57:06.864 --> 57:09.436
and like the Bugatti,

57:09.476 --> 57:13.796
the McLaren was built utterly without compromise.

57:13.836 --> 57:16.340
The engine bay was lined with gold

57:16.380 --> 57:18.872
because gold is the best heat reflector.

57:18.912 --> 57:21.684
An entirely new and unique gearbox had to be developed

57:21.724 --> 57:24.264
because no existing gearbox could survive the torque

57:24.304 --> 57:27.872
from the 6.1-litre BMW engine.

57:27.912 --> 57:33.436
It was the first carbon-fibre-bodied car.

57:33.476 --> 57:36.620
And although these cars have so much in common,

57:36.660 --> 57:42.340
the McLaren and the Veyron are actually poles apart.

57:42.380 --> 57:46.200
Whereas the Veyron is loaded with technology,

57:46.240 --> 57:50.512
the McLaren gets...nothing.

57:50.552 --> 57:53.652
No traction control, no ABS.

57:53.692 --> 58:01.056
It's gizmo cupboard is completely bare.

58:01.096 --> 58:02.652
The F1's creator wanted his machine to be

58:02.692 --> 58:06.700
just the greatest, the purest driving machine

58:06.740 --> 58:12.312
in the same way that Bugatti's creator wanted it to be the most amazing technical achievement.

58:12.352 --> 58:19.528
And that shines through in the way they feel.

58:19.568 --> 58:22.592
Changing gear, it's like sliding a bolt action forward on a rifle,

58:22.632 --> 58:26.720
that well-oiled, mechanical, metallic feel.

58:26.760 --> 58:31.608
And you sit slap-bang in the middle- for that racing-driver sensation.

58:31.648 --> 58:33.984
Oh, dear lord!

58:34.024 --> 58:40.560
HE LAUGHS

58:40.600 --> 58:45.012
OK. What I shall do now is climb out of the McLaren F1

58:45.052 --> 58:47.640
and get in to the Bugatti Veyron.

58:47.680 --> 58:51.264
Not a bad day this one so far!

58:51.304 --> 58:54.576
Right, to business.

58:54.616 --> 58:57.248
Because for the first time ever,

58:57.288 --> 59:03.516
these titans will now go head to head in a one-mile drag race.

59:03.556 --> 59:07.032
I shall be in the Veyron.

59:07.072 --> 59:10.448
And in the McLaren, a man who has no idea

59:10.488 --> 59:14.344
that he's about to make history.

59:14.384 --> 59:21.904
He is quite excited though, he saw his first camel today.

59:21.944 --> 59:24.216
Actually, I'm quite glad it's him in that car

59:24.256 --> 59:28.124
because today that McLaren is worth two million quid.

59:28.164 --> 59:32.704
If we do come together though, he does know the drill -

59:32.744 --> 59:36.748
run and meet at the border.

59:36.788 --> 59:41.188
Nearly ready. On paper, the Bugatti's got over a thousand horsepower,

59:41.228 --> 59:45.560
370 more than the McLaren but the McLaren weighs less.

59:45.600 --> 59:50.808
So it's got more power to weight. Nought to sixty the Bugatti should...

59:50.848 --> 59:53.168
I don't know, this is the real world.

59:53.208 --> 59:58.016
We'll have to see what happens.

59:58.056 --> 59:59.048
'Three

59:59.088 --> 01:00:00.264
'two,

01:00:00.304 --> 01:00:01.768
'one,

01:00:01.808 --> 01:00:03.608
'go!'

01:00:03.648 --> 01:00:05.392
Yes, this it!

01:00:05.432 --> 01:00:07.768
Forward into history.

01:00:07.808 --> 01:00:11.140
What? How is that happening?

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:14.688
How is that happening?

01:00:14.728 --> 01:00:18.752
The old pretender is still there, it won't give up its crown!

01:00:18.792 --> 01:00:22.828
We're now doing 240 kilometres an hour.

01:00:22.868 --> 01:00:25.704
Come on, Bugatti!

01:00:25.744 --> 01:00:27.656
I'm reeling him in.

01:00:27.696 --> 01:00:31.048
1000 horsepower, there's no way past that.

01:00:31.088 --> 01:00:34.640
I'm gonna take it, yes!

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:37.392
HE LAUGHS

01:00:37.432 --> 01:00:39.328
300 kilometres an hour.

01:00:39.368 --> 01:00:42.732
320 kilometres an hour!

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:46.240
Yes!

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:51.144
320 and I have clearly taken it!

01:00:51.184 --> 01:00:56.360
The Bugatti takes the prize.

01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.640
APPLAUSE

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.112
Honestly, what's in that? Hairs.

01:01:02.152 --> 01:01:04.048
Hairs on the back of the neck.

01:01:04.088 --> 01:01:07.316
Straight road.

01:01:07.356 --> 01:01:11.936
And of course what we've proved there is that the Bugatti Veyron,

01:01:11.976 --> 01:01:14.644
which we know to be the fastest car- in the world,

01:01:14.684 --> 01:01:17.860
is faster than another kind of car.

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.608
LAUGHTER Yes!

01:01:19.648 --> 01:01:22.532
Yeah, you don't get that kind of information everywhere!

01:01:22.572 --> 01:01:25.848
And so, on that bombshell, it's time to end.

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:27.200
See're next week! Thanks for watching! Take care. Goodnight.
