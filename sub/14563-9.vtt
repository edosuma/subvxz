WEBVTT

00:22.856 --> 00:24.691
BoJack! Beautiful day, huh?

00:24.775 --> 00:26.985
Perfect day to go outside,
not read the trades

00:27.069 --> 00:30.030
or talk to anyone in the industry
or watch entertainment television

00:30.113 --> 00:33.325
or have a gut feeling about the ratings
for your television show last night.

00:33.408 --> 00:36.370
- Princess Carolyn, I'm dying.
- You read the trades.

00:36.453 --> 00:39.122
My heart is in my stomach,
my stomach is in my butt,

00:39.206 --> 00:41.041
and my butt ran away with the spoon.

00:41.124 --> 00:44.253
That makes sense
because your butt is quite a dish.

00:44.336 --> 00:46.088
Can you come over? I need you.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.343
What the...?

00:52.594 --> 00:56.723
I ordered a few feel-better pizzas
to feel better. It did not work.

00:56.807 --> 00:59.768
Then I sprinkled happy pills on them,
and washed it all down

00:59.851 --> 01:03.230
with a "Please, God, make my pain go away"
vermouth and ice cream float.

01:03.313 --> 01:05.524
- Somehow I feel worse.
- That's a real mystery.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.986
My show was terrible.
Why did I insist on a mockumentary format?

01:09.069 --> 01:12.114
It's already an overused trope now,
in 2007.

01:12.239 --> 01:16.159
Hey! Mockumentary is not a trope,
it's a device for storytelling.

01:16.243 --> 01:19.871
And your show is daring and cutting edge.
People just aren't ready.

01:19.955 --> 01:22.332
Yeah. Yeah, people! It's not me.

01:22.416 --> 01:24.376
It's the people that are the problem!

01:24.459 --> 01:27.671
Everyone's dumb and I am great.
Why do I always forget that?

01:27.754 --> 01:28.839
That's the spirit.

01:28.922 --> 01:31.883
I'm starting to think this show is
the best thing that happened to me.

01:31.967 --> 01:32.801
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.721
It made me realize you're the best thing
that happened to me,

01:35.804 --> 01:38.348
with your sexy cat eyes
and your cute little hair curl.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.892
You look like a soft serve
strawberry ice cream.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.396
BoJack, we can't. I'm your agent.

01:44.479 --> 01:48.025
You are so much more than that.
You're my lighthouse, my Garmin.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.652
You're the little plastic table
they put in pizza boxes

01:50.736 --> 01:52.863
to keep the pizza from getting smushed.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.364
You're Princess Carolyn.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.748
Don't you break my heart,
BoJack Horseman.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.124
- What?
- What? Nothing.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.628
- Did you just say something to me?
- No, I was just being wistful, I guess.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.547
Well, can you be wistful a little quieter?

02:10.631 --> 02:13.925
- Not everyone is interested in your wist.
- Okay, BoJack.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.347
- You smell nice.
- Thanks, BoJack.

02:21.141 --> 02:27.773
<i>♪♪</i>

03:23.829 --> 03:26.832
Okay, gotta go. I'm about to meet
my most important client.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.751
- I know you're not really on the phone.
- Bye, Mr. President.

03:29.835 --> 03:33.088
Give my love to your basketball friends.
You too.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.590
Should we get dinner,
or are you just thinking drinks?

03:35.674 --> 03:37.968
- I'm not planning on staying long.
- Okay.

03:38.051 --> 03:41.763
I'm glad you wanted to meet,
because I am so pumped to tell you

03:41.847 --> 03:44.474
all about the exciting projects
I'm lining up for you.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.517
That won't be necessary.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.562
Once you get your Oscar nom,
we'll have our pick. That's the key.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.064
You think Halle Berry
would've been offered <i>Catwoman</i>

03:51.148 --> 03:52.357
if she wasn't an Oscar winner?

03:52.441 --> 03:54.609
We just gotta find you your <i>Catwoman.</i>

03:54.693 --> 03:56.278
I'm not sure if a <i>Catwoman</i>

03:56.361 --> 03:59.030
is really the best thing
for my career right now.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.783
Right, well, like I said,
we are getting lots of offers.

04:01.867 --> 04:02.951
Listen, Princess Carolyn--

04:03.034 --> 04:06.163
<i>Signore </i>Horseman!
<i>Principessa </i>Carolina!

04:06.246 --> 04:08.206
Sandro, how you doing,
you handsome devil?

04:08.290 --> 04:11.710
To be honest I am, how you say,
sweating bull's nets.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.754
- You mean sweating bullets?
- I don't think so.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.506
Sweating bullets.
How does that make the sense?

04:16.590 --> 04:18.258
How does sweating bull's nets
make sense?

04:18.341 --> 04:22.137
I don't want to be caught in bull's nets.
He may try to kiss me.

04:22.220 --> 04:27.642
I prefer kissing cows. No judgment,
just a preference. I love kissing cows!

04:27.726 --> 04:29.519
Don't tell my wife. I'm kidding!

04:29.603 --> 04:31.396
She knows. She's a cow!

04:31.480 --> 04:35.066
And I only kiss her.

04:35.150 --> 04:36.401
Okay, very good.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.445
Haven't you lived in America for 30 years?

04:38.528 --> 04:41.698
Ignore him. Why are you
sweating bullets and/or nets?

04:41.782 --> 04:46.953
Ah. Because there is a restaurant critic
here tonight.

04:47.037 --> 04:50.791
Very interesting.

04:50.874 --> 04:53.502
Critics are the worst.
That's my review of critics.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.587
Two thumbs down! Four percent fresh!

04:55.670 --> 04:58.215
One star! You all eat a flat butt!

04:58.298 --> 05:01.259
Did you not know there was a critic here?
You own this place.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.595
I never see you do anything
to help run it.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.347
This place runs itself. Right, Sandro?

05:05.430 --> 05:09.267
Well, my wife and children and therapy man
may not agree so much,

05:09.351 --> 05:11.061
but if you say so, <i>Signore </i>Horseman.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.605
Even his wife and kids
and therapy man agree.

05:13.688 --> 05:18.151
Well, as the Black Guy Pete say,
"Tonight's gonna be a good night."

05:18.235 --> 05:19.820
Please. Enjoy.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.906
I know you're not happy about
what happened with the Kelsey project.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.284
I pushed a little too hard to get you
the money you deserve.

05:26.368 --> 05:30.163
What can I say? Sometimes I'm too good
of an agent, so deals fall apart.

05:30.247 --> 05:32.541
That's a thing that happens
when agents are really good.

05:32.624 --> 05:33.917
- That's not--
- Moving forward!

05:34.000 --> 05:36.503
I know you're not happy
with how I handled <i>Ethan Around.</i>

05:36.586 --> 05:38.088
- Or didn't handle it.
- Bygones!

05:38.171 --> 05:41.007
It was because I was busy
getting you the <i>Pegasus </i>movie,

05:41.091 --> 05:43.426
which I know you did not get,
but trust me,

05:43.510 --> 05:47.138
you'll see not getting these movies was
the best thing that ever happened to you.

05:47.222 --> 05:50.225
Onwards and upwards!
Tally ho! To the stars!

05:50.308 --> 05:52.477
Okay, you're forcing me to use the cards.

05:54.771 --> 05:59.359
"Princess Carolyn, clear throat,
I have been very disappointed--"

05:59.442 --> 06:01.027
Ring! Hello, Your Highness.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.780
It's a king, I have to take this.
In the bathroom.

06:04.656 --> 06:07.492
Oh, fish, oh, fish!

06:07.576 --> 06:09.536
Who's out there?
Are you talking to me?

06:09.619 --> 06:11.204
No.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.123
All right, Pink Lady, think.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.542
- Are you talking to me?
- Are you a pink lady?

06:15.625 --> 06:18.503
I was a Pink Lady in my high
school's production of <i>Grease.</i>

06:18.587 --> 06:21.298
- Were you Rizzo?
- No, Jan.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.008
Then don't waste my time.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.849
Now, let us bow our heads and bray.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.070
Yes, right away!

06:45.322 --> 06:50.368
So back to what you were--

06:50.452 --> 06:52.787
- Oh, my goodness, what is this?
- Yeah, what is this?

06:52.871 --> 06:56.541

06:56.625 --> 06:58.418

<i>♪ Twenty-three years ♪</i>

07:13.642 --> 07:15.018
Okay, cool.

07:15.101 --> 07:19.522
Can you believe it, BoJack?
It's been almost a quarter of a century.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.816
Talking on the phone
pretty much every day,

07:21.900 --> 07:23.985
sharing our deepest dreams and secrets,

07:24.069 --> 07:26.988
being there for each other
through all of it, bosom friends,

07:27.072 --> 07:28.531
<i>Anne of Green Gables</i> style.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.409
Let's toast to another 23 years.
What do you say?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.912
- You're fired.
- Uh-- Oh.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.790
I can't believe this. You're firing me?

07:36.873 --> 07:37.958
- Me?
- What? No.

07:38.041 --> 07:40.961
You have no idea,
everything I do around here!

07:41.044 --> 07:43.338
- Half the kitchen staff is my family.
- No.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.215
- Honestly, just--
- I detest you!

07:45.298 --> 07:47.550
I hope you rot in the hell!

07:47.634 --> 07:51.012
- We're headed down a road that--
- You washed-up has-been no-good joke!

07:51.096 --> 07:53.264
You are the opposite of an onion,

07:53.348 --> 07:57.018
because if I cut you, I am no gonna cry.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.436
Well, now you are fired.

07:58.520 --> 08:02.649
Good luck finding another charming
first-generation Italian immigrant

08:02.732 --> 08:07.612
with this kind of darling accent,
who makes equally delightful malapropisms!

08:07.696 --> 08:10.490
You, sir, have just cut off your nose

08:10.573 --> 08:13.284
and thrown Sprite in your face!

08:13.368 --> 08:18.039
I am a classic stereotype
that is tough to come by nowadays,

08:18.123 --> 08:21.501
because Italians don't emigrate
so much to America no more.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.795
Botticelli, Barbarelli, Beetle Bailey!

08:23.878 --> 08:26.756
Modigliani, Masaccio, Marmaduke!

08:26.840 --> 08:28.675
<i>Avanti,</i> all of you! <i>Andiamo!</i>

08:30.677 --> 08:32.512
So that was weird, huh?

08:34.097 --> 08:35.932
Please stop looking at me.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.184
Too bad about Sandro, huh?

08:38.268 --> 08:41.021
You're the one who's fired, obviously.

08:42.897 --> 08:43.773
Right.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.610
Ryan Murphy is doing a re-imagining
of <i>The Life and Times of Harriet Tubman.</i>

08:47.694 --> 08:50.363
But in this version, she's a tub-man,

08:50.447 --> 08:53.074
with the comparative strength
and agility of a tub!

08:53.158 --> 08:54.701
- PC.
- He's looking for someone

08:54.784 --> 08:57.120
to play the Underground
Railroad conductor.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.122
Great, but you don't represent me anymore.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.416
Okay, I get it. I'm fired. Sheesk.

09:01.499 --> 09:04.002
You're gonna spend a couple days
being mad at me,

09:04.085 --> 09:07.922
then I'll get you another gig, and you'll
be my client again, just like every time.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.508
Can we get past the part
where you're mad at me

09:10.592 --> 09:13.261
and get to the part where
you're stealing General Lee's plutonium

09:13.344 --> 09:16.056
to fuel your subterranean
steam-punk slave-tram?

09:16.848 --> 09:18.808
"It's best, for both of us,

09:18.892 --> 09:22.103
if we end this relationship
once and for all."

09:22.187 --> 09:24.939
I'm sorry I screwed up,
you don't have to read off the--

09:25.023 --> 09:28.401
"You take me for granted, made decisions
that were against my wishes,

09:28.485 --> 09:32.072
and worst of all
she's got my globes a-warming!"

09:32.155 --> 09:34.491
- How did that get in there?
- What is that?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.826
A punch line to a joke
from the roast of January Jones.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.621
- A global warming joke?
- It's an important issue. Here we go.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.498
"Our relationship no longer has any--"

09:41.581 --> 09:43.917
"January has only gotten hotter and hot--"
Nope.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.212
- Were you at the roast of January Jones?
- No, but I wrote some jokes

09:47.295 --> 09:49.172
in case someone got sick
and they needed a backup.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.217
Do you even know January Jones?
Why would they call you?

09:52.300 --> 09:56.763
I guess I thought that my agent could
get me in the mix if Jason Sudeikis--

09:56.846 --> 09:58.723
How did these get out of order?

09:58.807 --> 10:00.892
So in the joke,
are the globes your balls?

10:00.975 --> 10:03.144
And they get warm
when you see January Jones?

10:03.228 --> 10:04.479
Is that how balls work?

10:04.562 --> 10:06.397
I don't know. It's a work in progress.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.857
Professional integrity!

10:07.941 --> 10:10.610
"Our relationship no longer
has any professional integrity.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.695
So it's gotta end. Stand to leave."

10:12.779 --> 10:14.197
Shouldn't have read that part.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.117
"When you reflect on this,
you'll see it's best for both of us.

10:17.200 --> 10:19.244
Exit restaurant." Goddamn it.

10:19.327 --> 10:22.080
Wow, that was--
I don't know what that was.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.665
Hey! Where are you going?

10:25.792 --> 10:29.295
- Who gave you this idea? Spanakopita?
- This has nothing to do with Ana.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.880
Here you go, sir.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.299
- I'll get it!
- You two are b'thumping.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.884
Now you do whatever she says?

10:34.968 --> 10:36.219
- Is that what's happening?
- No.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.180
No, you're not b'thumping or no,
you're not doing whatever she says?

10:39.264 --> 10:41.933
- I'm not doing whatever she says.
- So you <i>are </i>b'thumping.

10:42.016 --> 10:46.312
I understand from context what you mean,
but there's no way b'thumping is a thing.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.230
I'll get it!

10:47.313 --> 10:50.316
You don't have to do everything
your little falafel pocket tells you to.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.154
- You screwed up!
- Once! In 23 years!

10:54.237 --> 10:55.071
I'll get 'em.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.283
All these years I carried you,
when no one wanted to work with you.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.285
I still managed to get you jobs.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.370
And then you would flake,
or sabotage them,

11:02.453 --> 11:06.249
or get wrapped up in some crisis
or emergency or vague sadness.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.627
Everyone told me to dump you--
my bosses, film execs, directors,

11:09.711 --> 11:12.505
they all told me you were washed up,
a nobody, a has-been,

11:12.589 --> 11:15.884
- a joke, too portly for TV.
- Too portly for TV? Who said that?

11:15.967 --> 11:17.719
- It doesn't matter.
- It does. Who said it?

11:17.802 --> 11:22.098
- Luis Guzman.
- Luis Guzman said I'm too portly for TV?

11:22.181 --> 11:24.517
You're right, BoJack.
This is for the best.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.854
I no longer have to lug your talentless,
self-centered, self-sabotaging,

11:27.937 --> 11:30.023
dead-weight carcass
of faded talent around my neck.

11:30.106 --> 11:31.733
- Hey.
- Thank you for firing me.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.319
I'm gonna go pour myself
a little celebratory potato juice,

11:34.402 --> 11:37.238
because this is the best goddamn
thing that's ever happened to me.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.908
Hey! Hey! Hey!

11:43.661 --> 11:44.746
Ha, ha! I'll get it.

11:44.829 --> 11:47.373
You do not talk to me like that
and walk away.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.042
Oh, no? What's happening?

11:49.125 --> 11:52.670
This is so weird. I'm walking away,
even though you told me not to.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.589
Right, I don't work for you anymore.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.841
- Hey!
- Excuse me, Mr. Horseman?

11:56.925 --> 11:59.761
- Not now.
- We have a slight problem in the kitchen.

11:59.844 --> 12:02.180
- Where is everybody?
- That's the problem. They all quit.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.599
The kitchen's backed up with orders.
No one's getting food.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.309
And the critic is growing very impatient.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.979
Writing that down...

12:10.063 --> 12:12.440
- Just do what you normally do.
- But there's no chef.

12:12.523 --> 12:15.401
Tonight's your lucky night.
You just got promoted.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.780
But I don't want to be a chef.
<i>♪ I want to sing ♪</i>

12:18.863 --> 12:22.158
Kidding. I'm actually just happy
being a waiter. I'm not my job.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.787
- A lot of people think that--
- You're the chef! Start cheffing!

12:25.870 --> 12:26.704
Oh.

12:31.793 --> 12:35.505
What? Fifty teeth?
Get out of here. Let me see.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.590
-Ahh...
-Would you look at that.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.592
You're thrilled
to have me out of your life?

12:39.676 --> 12:43.096
- I was such a burden all those years.
- Can I close my mouth now?

12:43.179 --> 12:45.014
- Know what I think?
- Don't wanna hear it.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.641
You like being there to rescue me.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.435
- I close my mouth, okay?
- Nobody cares!

12:49.519 --> 12:51.229
- Okay--
- Nope, I'm still counting.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.147
You like it when I'm a mess.

12:53.231 --> 12:55.108
Because it makes you feel good
about yourself.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.068
Guess what? I never asked for that.

12:57.151 --> 12:58.695
You ask all the time.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.197
You have never not been asking me
to rescue you.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.074
"Princess Carolyn, help me!

13:03.157 --> 13:06.452
I slept with the gaffer's wife
and now he's not lighting me properly.

13:06.536 --> 13:10.039
Princess Carolyn, I threw up
on Elle Fanning in a bounce house.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.959
Princess Carolyn,
why am I such a big stupid asshole?"

13:13.042 --> 13:15.420
Okay, great, more abuse.
Right on schedule.

13:15.503 --> 13:16.546
Oh, that's abuse?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.589
"BoJack, you're such
a big, stupid asshole.

13:18.673 --> 13:21.259
BoJack, why were you even
in the bounce house, dummy?

13:21.342 --> 13:24.387
BoJack, you wasted my thirties!"

13:24.470 --> 13:26.764
I never said you wasted my thirties.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.599
Didn't have to, you're always saying it.

13:28.683 --> 13:33.146
And I don't like being around you,
because I feel bad.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.857
You make me feel bad.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.901
So this isn't about me being a bad agent.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.903
It's about a lot of things.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.072
- Where are you going?
- Away.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.741
Hey, listen, man.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.994
I don't wanna get in the middle of this,
it's none of my business,

13:48.077 --> 13:50.663
but I just have to say
I love that sweater.

13:50.747 --> 13:52.582
- Can you give it to me?
- What? No.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.792
I held my mouth open a really long time.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.420
- What does that have to do--?
- You're not being fair,

13:57.503 --> 13:59.172
to me or Princess Katniss.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.423
- Who?
- Your friend.

14:00.506 --> 14:03.509
You've forgotten her already?
Typical BoSchwack.

14:03.593 --> 14:04.844
That's enough out of you.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.388
It's all right,
you're gonna get through this.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.849
- You're gonna get through this.
- Are you okay?

14:09.932 --> 14:12.268
Are you okay?
You've been in there a long time.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.228
I left for a while and came back.

14:14.312 --> 14:17.023
Just so you know,
this wasn't an easy decision.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.484
- This is the ladies' room!
- What's going on out there?

14:19.567 --> 14:21.361
Are you watching a movie?

14:21.444 --> 14:23.154
I agonized over this. Ask Ana.

14:23.237 --> 14:26.824
- Oh. So you did talk about it with Ana.
- Yeah. I respect her opinion.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.830
Paws not claws! Paws not claws!

14:32.914 --> 14:35.124
Hey! Ow! God, you're strong.

14:43.591 --> 14:47.220
This is exactly the kind of
unprofessionalism I'm talking about.

14:47.303 --> 14:51.015
- You want to talk about professionalism?
- Yes, I do.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.686
But not here.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.109
You say you want professionalism?
Bullshit.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.945
You want a mommy
you can slide your dick in.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.322
I can want that
and also want professionalism.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.200
A sex-mommy who keeps her boundaries,
is that too much to ask?

15:09.283 --> 15:11.619
Is there a single woman
you've worked with

15:11.702 --> 15:14.872
who you haven't tried
to groggily thrust yourself into?

15:14.956 --> 15:17.583
Is it any wonder
I don't want to be around you?

15:17.667 --> 15:19.919
All you do is tell me
I'm a terrible person.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.922
Please, you're such
a self-pitying masochist,

15:23.005 --> 15:25.550
I could say ten nice things
and one mean thing,

15:25.633 --> 15:27.343
you would only hear the one mean thing.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.679
I'd love it
if you said ten nice things to me.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.682
- I can say nice things.
- Ready when you are.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.726
Does self-pitying masochist count,
or are we starting from scratch?

15:35.810 --> 15:38.271
Okay, one-- I'm freezing my whiskers off.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.524
- You have a natural charisma.
- You hesitated, that means it's a lie.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.526
Two, you are loved by millions.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.446
That's not a compliment.
So is Kim Jong Un and Teri Hatcher.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.030
I got this. I got this.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.116
Pre-heat oven?
Where's the pre-heat button?

15:50.700 --> 15:51.993
Excuse me? Waiter?

15:52.076 --> 15:54.370
Where are my family's
double-fudge cheese pies?

15:54.454 --> 15:56.747
I'm not your waiter anymore.
I'm the chef.

15:56.831 --> 16:00.626
- Then who's our waiter?
- Uh, you're the waiter now. Ta-da!

16:00.710 --> 16:01.961
I can't be a waiter.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.464
I have a very important
business meeting tomorrow.

16:04.547 --> 16:08.050
You get someone else to do it.
I'm the chef and whatever I say goes!

16:08.134 --> 16:10.470
Okay. Who gets these
soy balls and onion cubes?

16:10.553 --> 16:12.054
Table eight.
Deliver those soy balls, soldier.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.473
You got it, boss.

16:14.182 --> 16:16.517
Number six.
You know how to make me laugh.

16:16.601 --> 16:19.270
So I'm a clown to you?
Like Joe Pesci in <i>Home Alone?</i>

16:19.353 --> 16:21.856
You recognize
you're being impossible, right?

16:21.939 --> 16:26.444
- I don't know how you put up with me.
- I didn't put up with you, BoJack.

16:26.527 --> 16:29.947
I liked being with you.
And I don't regret it.

16:30.031 --> 16:32.617
I don't regret the trip to the Bahamas.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.286
Or the bracelet you bought me
for my 38th birthday.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.537
Or when my dad died

16:36.621 --> 16:39.457
and you came to the funeral
with me and held my hand.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.418
I'm doing this for both of us.
You understand?

16:42.502 --> 16:45.963
- Did you ever love me? At all?
- I don't-- I'm not--

16:46.881 --> 16:50.801
You know that I don't do
the whole love thing.

16:50.885 --> 16:55.139
Either you end up hurting someone
or they hurt you. So, what's the point?

16:55.223 --> 16:56.390
Yeah.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.101
Ugh. This sucks. Ow.

16:59.185 --> 17:02.104
I did this to myself. I do this to myself.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.524
- Why do I do this to myself?
- I don't know.

17:04.607 --> 17:06.567
Maybe if you're good at putting out fires,

17:06.651 --> 17:08.778
you just run from fire to fire
and don't really think about--

17:09.904 --> 17:13.407
Oh, God, I don't wanna be a chef!
I want to be not on fire!

17:13.491 --> 17:17.078
- We gotta put out that fire!
- I hate Mondays!

17:18.120 --> 17:21.666
I figured out
how to pre-heat the oven.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.544
This night has been a disaster.

17:24.627 --> 17:27.838
The good news is I got my kid
to prep my important meeting at work.

17:27.922 --> 17:30.299
The bad news is
all the customers went home.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.634
They didn't like the screaming

17:31.717 --> 17:34.303
and felt like their food
was a little too "on fire".

17:34.387 --> 17:36.681
- It's called a char, dumbshits.
- The critic's still here.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.225
Oh, oh, oh!

17:39.517 --> 17:41.561
She still wants her mushroom risotto.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.565
I don't know how to make risotto.

17:45.648 --> 17:46.691
I know how.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.609
What are you doing? No, go home.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.279
You're right. What am I doing?

17:51.362 --> 17:52.613
All right.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.325
Good luck.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.791
<i>♪ Keep driving, keep driving ♪</i>

18:03.874 --> 18:06.669

18:06.752 --> 18:10.548

18:15.511 --> 18:17.471
Ugh. Who do they write these songs for?

18:18.055 --> 18:22.643

<i>Princess Carolyn ♪</i>

18:22.727 --> 18:25.563

18:25.646 --> 18:26.939
Ugh.

18:29.900 --> 18:30.943
Goddamn it.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.655
How should I know?
Do I look like an expert in cooking oils?

18:34.739 --> 18:37.325
We have to choose!
We're running out of time.

18:37.408 --> 18:40.494
- Olive. You wanna use olive oil.
- What are you doing?

18:40.578 --> 18:42.872
Let me do this.
You'll burn the place to the ground.

18:42.955 --> 18:46.083
Fine. This isn't one of those things
where you save my ass

18:46.167 --> 18:48.419
so I feel obligated to give you
your job back.

18:48.502 --> 18:51.130
I know you have no sense
of obligation to me.

18:51.213 --> 18:55.343
Ooh, slam. I'm sorry,
I'd rather not get involved.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.511
- Can I get you some more water?
- Mmm.

18:57.595 --> 18:59.597
You look lovely. It's a great blouse.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.641
Mom, I wanna go home.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.893
This is a very important night
for the restaurant.

19:03.976 --> 19:07.480
How are we coming on the sales meeting?
Did you get the big conference room?

19:07.563 --> 19:11.442
Winslow wants the big conference room
for his presentation to corporate.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.528
You get back on that phone
and you get me that big room.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.405
Okay, Mom.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.659
The secret is stirring continuously.

19:19.742 --> 19:22.161
Right, so that's the secret.

19:22.244 --> 19:25.706
I'm gonna go roll some more soy balls.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.209
- Thanks for your help.
- Sure.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.169
How do you know how to do this?

19:30.252 --> 19:32.296
Mom was a live-in maid for a rich family.

19:32.380 --> 19:35.466
She had a little trouble
bending her elbow too much. Glug, glug.

19:35.549 --> 19:39.929
So unless I wanted us to be on the street,
I had to cover for her, a lot.

19:40.012 --> 19:43.766
That rich family loved Italian food
and champagne fountains.

19:43.849 --> 19:47.061
And cocaine. And private jets.
And screaming at each other.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.647
"Who threw my cocaine
in the champagne fountain?"

19:49.730 --> 19:52.316
- So standard rich people stuff?
- I guess.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.820
- How come you never told me that?
- I did.

19:55.903 --> 19:56.737
Oh.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.823
It's okay. I know
you never remember anything.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.867
That's not true.
I remember the first time we met.

20:01.951 --> 20:05.121
<i>I went to see Marv. You were</i>
<i>at the desk in front of his office.</i>

20:05.204 --> 20:08.582
<i>I thought you were cute and you said,</i>
<i>"It's good to see you again."</i>

20:09.625 --> 20:13.254
- Oh. So I guess we'd met before.
- That was the third time we met.

20:13.337 --> 20:17.341
The first time was when I was an intern.
I delivered a script to your house.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.137
<i>You were passed out in the yard,</i>
<i>covered in tapioca pudding.</i>

20:21.220 --> 20:23.973
<i>I hosed you down, dragged you inside,</i>
<i>covered you with a blanket.</i>

20:24.056 --> 20:26.600
- Really? I don't remember that.
- Shocker.

20:26.684 --> 20:30.020
So you've gone from daughter of a maid
to head of your own company.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.314
Well, the company's not doing so hot.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.775
- Don't try to guilt me.
- It's not your fault.

20:34.859 --> 20:38.154
Turns out being an agent and running
an agency are two different skills.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.866
It's like asking a really delicious tomato
to make you a tomato sandwich.

20:41.949 --> 20:44.744
How's a tomato gonna make you
a sandwich? He's got no arms.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.538
You'll figure it out. Princess Carolyn
always lands on her feet.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.916
But I don't even know why I'm doing it.
Does any of it matter?

20:51.000 --> 20:54.003
Why are you an agent at all
if it makes you so miserable?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.254
Because I'm good at it.

20:55.337 --> 20:59.216
I mean, stuff hasn't been hitting lately.
But, usually, I'm really good at it.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.844
Just 'cause you're good at something
doesn't mean you have to do it.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.847
I'm good at driving sober,
but I don't relish the opportunity.

21:04.930 --> 21:08.309
But what else would I do?
Who else would I be?

21:09.894 --> 21:11.729
I do love you, by the way.

21:11.812 --> 21:15.357
I mean, as much
as I'm capable of loving anyone.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.486
Which is never enough. I'm sorry.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.450
Ta-da!

21:27.912 --> 21:33.501
Well, it is truly...

21:33.584 --> 21:37.338
how should I put this? Wonderful.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.632
So you'll give Elefante a good review?

21:39.715 --> 21:44.762
Oh, no, I can't do that.
I waited over two hours to be served.

21:44.845 --> 21:48.349
The ambience was terrible.
You two were screaming all night.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.727
At one point, a waiter
ran through the restaurant on fire.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.356
Unfortunately,
you will be receiving my lowest rating:

21:55.439 --> 21:59.026
four hundred and twelve stars,
out of a possible a billion.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.194
A billion stars?

22:00.277 --> 22:04.323
Yes, that's the rubric I use on
SamanthaGoesToRestaurants.tumblr.com.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.742
Oh, God, get out.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.453
I assure you the animated GIFs

22:09.537 --> 22:13.290
with which I describe this encounter
shall be scathing.

22:13.374 --> 22:16.669
Mom! I just touched base
with Rooney, re: Winslow.

22:16.752 --> 22:20.172
He's out, we're in.
The conference room is ours.

22:20.256 --> 22:23.592
Perfect! This is the meeting
where we finally convince the big boys

22:23.676 --> 22:25.636
to let us get babies addicted to vaping!

22:25.719 --> 22:28.430
Yes! Corporation!

22:33.018 --> 22:34.812
- How about a drink?
- I could drink.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.897
I don't think I can. I'm heading out.

22:36.981 --> 22:39.733
I got pretty badly burnt earlier
and in a lot of pain.

22:39.817 --> 22:42.236
I should probably go to the ER.
Have a great night.

22:45.990 --> 22:46.824
Ha, ha!

22:48.701 --> 22:50.160
What's the second time we met?

22:50.244 --> 22:53.706
- A taping of <i>Horsin' Around.</i>
- Which episode?

22:53.789 --> 22:56.959
<i>The one where Olivia put too much</i>
<i>detergent in the washing machine.</i>

22:57.042 --> 22:59.128
<i>Nancy Reagan was the guest star.</i>

22:59.211 --> 23:01.672
<i>That woman</i>
<i>was the real actor in the family.</i>

23:01.755 --> 23:05.843
<i>I just started working for Marv.</i>
<i>I went backstage to introduce myself.</i>

23:06.468 --> 23:07.553
And then what happened?

23:07.636 --> 23:10.472
You told me you were too tired
pretending to be nice all night,

23:10.556 --> 23:13.058
- and I needed to leave you alone.
- Oh.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.643
I'm a real jerk, huh?

23:14.727 --> 23:17.021
Yeah, but you're honest,
straightforward,

23:17.104 --> 23:19.315
not fake nice
and don't beat around the bush.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.942
Your heart is tender,
so you protect it from people,

23:22.026 --> 23:26.030
but sometimes you open up a wall
and it's incredible.

23:26.113 --> 23:29.575
You're doing the best you can,
considering your asshole parents.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.076
You have great taste in art,

23:31.160 --> 23:34.079
and that pink spot
on your nose is just adorable.

23:34.163 --> 23:36.081
How many nice things was that,
about ten?

23:36.165 --> 23:38.584
- Yeah, just about.
- Okay, one more.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.712
You let me help you tonight
because you knew I needed it.

23:41.795 --> 23:44.632
You did it for me,
which was very sweet.

23:44.715 --> 23:47.843
Thanks. You're a good friend to me.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.554
- BoJack...
- Yeah?

23:50.638 --> 23:51.889
Are we friends?

23:51.972 --> 23:54.350
Yeah. I mean, I think we are.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.393
Or I think we can be.

23:56.477 --> 23:59.938
Okay, then as a friend, I'm asking you...

24:00.022 --> 24:01.690
Please don't leave me.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.275
- Princess Carolyn--
- Please.

24:03.359 --> 24:06.070
I can turn this around,
I just need more time.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.405
We're in a fragile period,
still finding our feet.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.991
Just give me six months
and then you can go.

24:11.075 --> 24:14.244
I promise,
I'll never ask anything from you again,

24:14.328 --> 24:17.247
but please, give me six months.

24:17.331 --> 24:19.500
Sorry, I left my coat here.

24:25.673 --> 24:26.965
I got it.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.517
So? What do you think?

24:37.267 --> 24:38.102
