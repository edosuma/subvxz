00:18.018 --> 00:19.645
<i>Previously on </i> Bad Blood.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.607
We want you to only buy from us.
No more Declan.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.650
You get a tip like this
it's from a competitor.

00:24.733 --> 00:26.527
<i>The bust will barely cause a dent.</i>

00:26.610 --> 00:28.405
They'll have another running in no time.

00:28.488 --> 00:31.742
You will work with the Irish.
Declan is no longer welcome.

00:31.825 --> 00:34.452
We gotta hit 'em,
keep 'em off balance.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.078
When something like this happens,

00:36.162 --> 00:38.205
we eliminate everyone involved.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.623
Nobody's gonna touch my son.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.293
Eight fentanyl overdoses
over the weekend in Hamilton.

00:42.377 --> 00:45.130
<i>There's a couple kids
they found on a reserve.</i>

00:45.213 --> 00:46.757
We're shutting it down.

00:46.840 --> 00:48.340
So, what you want to talk about?

00:48.425 --> 00:50.177
Pops says we're out, OK? But I'm still in.

00:50.260 --> 00:51.762
Someone put fentanyl in the drugs.

00:51.845 --> 00:54.805
I wanna destroy those bastards,
every last one of them.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.348
I heard about your son.

00:56.432 --> 00:57.892
My condolences.

00:57.975 --> 01:00.520
I told Nats everything! You hear me?

01:00.603 --> 01:02.480
No matter what happens,

01:02.563 --> 01:04.982
you will protect her and Adamo.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.317
RCMP.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.820
He didn't tell you
that his wife was snitching.

01:08.903 --> 01:10.780
I wonder what else he hasn't told you.

01:10.863 --> 01:12.990
You talked to the cops!
You tell me what you said!

01:13.073 --> 01:15.660
But I know these people,
and their love of family.

01:15.743 --> 01:19.122
<i>The only way we win
is to get them to rip themselves apart.</i>

01:19.205 --> 01:20.832
This is where it starts.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.380
There you are! Hey, hey!

01:28.465 --> 01:30.217
I was looking for you.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.177
- Hey.
- How you doing?

01:33.260 --> 01:35.053
I've just been thinking, you know,

01:35.138 --> 01:37.265
maybe I should just go.

01:37.348 --> 01:38.600
- Go where?
- I don't know.

01:38.683 --> 01:41.643
Like,
I could still get into a halfway house.

01:41.727 --> 01:44.313
Like, that's what I was supposed to do.

01:44.397 --> 01:46.190
I was supposed to go, and I didn't go.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.233
You're not going anywhere. You're with me.

01:50.487 --> 01:52.363
I can't stop thinking about that cop.

01:55.450 --> 01:57.160
His family never gets to see him again.

01:57.243 --> 01:58.953
You gotta stop doing this to yourself.

01:59.037 --> 02:00.788
OK, stop it. That was an accident.

02:00.872 --> 02:02.623
He's dead cos of me.

02:02.707 --> 02:04.958
Reggie, I've been there. It's hard.

02:05.042 --> 02:08.294
But that one moment
does not define who you are.

02:09.547 --> 02:11.090
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, come on, stop it!

02:11.173 --> 02:13.342
You don't have to apologize
to anyone for anything.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.512
I'd be dead if you didn't do what you did.

02:15.595 --> 02:17.847
You ever thought about that?
Or we'd be in prison.

02:17.930 --> 02:19.848
Well, maybe I should be in prison,
alright?

02:19.932 --> 02:22.643
Cos my whole life, everything I do,
I just make things worse.

02:22.727 --> 02:24.728
I want you to stop thinking like that.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.690
Hang on a second. I gotta take this.

02:29.817 --> 02:30.817
Yeah?

02:30.860 --> 02:33.738
- <i>Did you get my photos?
- </i> Give me a minute.

02:35.490 --> 02:36.573
Alright.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.995
<i>Look, we don't have anything
linking the twins to the church operation.</i>

02:41.078 --> 02:42.830
It's basically chemistry equipment.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.957
<i>We searched the place high and low.</i>

02:45.040 --> 02:46.208
That lighter...

02:47.002 --> 02:48.002
That's Teresa's.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.213
- How do you know that?
- <i>Cos I know!</i>

02:50.297 --> 02:53.090
Dust it for prints.
You'll match it to hers.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.550
You'll get yourselves a warrant.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.887
I don't think her prints
are gonna be in our system.

02:56.970 --> 02:58.303
Well, they're somewhere!

02:58.387 --> 03:00.390
You wanna play with the big boys,
figure it out.

03:05.895 --> 03:07.272
Reggie!

03:14.487 --> 03:15.697
<i>What did you say?</i>

03:15.780 --> 03:18.240
<i>Just about the two,</i>

03:18.323 --> 03:20.452
<i>Christian and Teresa.</i>

03:20.535 --> 03:23.622
<i>You tell me your exact words to them,</i>

03:23.705 --> 03:24.997
<i>exactly what you said to them.</i>

03:25.080 --> 03:27.458
<i>Just about the fentanyl,
but that they wanna do it,</i>

03:27.542 --> 03:30.002
<i>and you don't want to,
and your family doesn't want to and...</i>

03:31.545 --> 03:33.673
- Where'd you get this?
- My doorstep.

03:34.757 --> 03:37.302
There's another recording
of when you went to see Nats.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.720
He lied to you, Enzo.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.763
He knew all about this,
and he didn't tell you.

03:41.847 --> 03:43.447
So, you don't know who sent this to you?

03:43.515 --> 03:46.643
- No. What difference does it make?
- Well, what if it's Teresa and Christian?

03:46.727 --> 03:48.688
They could be testing us
to see if we're loyal.

03:48.772 --> 03:51.357
We're not telling them squat.
This stays in the family.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.025
I agree. You don't say a word.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.860
- Listen, this could be a fake.
- A fake?

03:54.943 --> 03:57.572
What is this, <i>Mission Impossible?</i>

03:58.447 --> 04:00.115
Who could record them in prison?

04:00.198 --> 04:02.702
I don't know. We gotta stick
with the issue at hand here.

04:02.785 --> 04:05.455
You know what we gotta do.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.415
We're not touching her.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.333
Enzo,

04:09.417 --> 04:11.918
if this was anybody else but Val,
it would already be done.

04:12.003 --> 04:13.963
We're not touching her.

04:14.047 --> 04:16.589
Nats is gonna be in prison
for the next 20 years.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.677
I'm not leaving my grandson
without a father or a mother.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.388
Enzo, come on! You know
where this is gonna go.

04:22.472 --> 04:24.640
It's Adamo's birthday tomorrow.

04:26.142 --> 04:28.185
I don't wanna talk about
knocking off his mother.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.145
I can't believe she's even having a party.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.647
Husband's in prison.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.317
It's an embarrassment.
I mean, I'm not going.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.985
- What?
- What am I gonna do?

04:36.068 --> 04:38.403
- Enzo, she's a rat.
- You're coming.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.155
Luca, you're coming!

04:40.238 --> 04:43.075
You're gonna smile, eat her food
and sing goddamn <i>"Happy Birthday".</i>

04:43.910 --> 04:45.995
This is about my grandson.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.288
OK?

04:50.875 --> 04:54.587
She's my daughter-in-law,
not some bum in Gore Park.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.465
End of story.

05:04.222 --> 05:06.348
- Pop, are you serious?
- Don't start!

05:06.432 --> 05:09.227
I mean, you go behind my back.
You talked to those twins.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.103
You don't, you don't get a say.

05:12.147 --> 05:13.982
It's between me and my brother.

06:02.530 --> 06:05.198
That's 90%. Perfect. Come on!

06:05.282 --> 06:07.118
They beefed up border security
on the river.

06:07.202 --> 06:09.537
- So be extra careful.
- Don't worry about it.

06:09.620 --> 06:11.663
I got you.
It takes 26 minutes to get across.

06:11.747 --> 06:13.290
Engine quiet, lights out.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.000
Water pigs stick to the same route.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.295
So we know how to avoid 'em. I'm your guy!

06:17.378 --> 06:19.672
Just do it right.
I'll see you on the other side.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.508
Let's go.

06:22.592 --> 06:24.927
<i>I had a lot of spinning plates in the air.</i>

06:25.010 --> 06:26.970
<i>I was keeping the business running,</i>

06:27.053 --> 06:29.640
<i>going after the twins
and trying to take care of Reggie.</i>

06:29.723 --> 06:31.933
<i>So I couldn't be in all places at once.</i>

06:32.017 --> 06:34.395
<i>Everything on the reserve
ran smoothly under Rose,</i>

06:34.478 --> 06:36.855
<i>so I wasn't looking
at the people around her</i>

06:36.938 --> 06:39.817
<i>the way I usually would, but I should've.</i>

06:46.948 --> 06:50.202
<i>I've always found that
when things are going off without a hitch,</i>

06:50.285 --> 06:53.790
<i>it means that someone on the inside
is working extra hard</i>

06:53.873 --> 06:56.792
<i>to make sure you don't look twice.</i>

07:03.090 --> 07:04.342
What are you doing?

07:04.425 --> 07:05.510
I had to drop off my tools.

07:05.593 --> 07:08.345
That couldn't wait?
We're dividing it up in the garage.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.430
Hurry up! Declan's gotta meet his buyers.

07:10.515 --> 07:13.308
No problem. Everything's cool, sis.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.168
<i>You don't recognize me?</i>

07:40.252 --> 07:43.005
Well, if I recognize you,
I'm not gonna go, "Who are you?"

07:44.257 --> 07:45.465
Who are you?

07:47.092 --> 07:48.635
<i>You gave us up.</i>

07:50.053 --> 07:51.430
Your children.

07:52.265 --> 07:54.517
You gave up me
and my beautiful little sister

07:54.600 --> 07:55.727
so you could get high.

08:12.702 --> 08:14.287
Call your dad.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.632
Hello?

08:26.715 --> 08:27.925
<i>Hey, Papa, it's me.</i>

08:28.008 --> 08:29.593
Nats? You OK?

08:29.677 --> 08:32.304
Yeah, I'm fine.
Bobby gave me a phone to call you.

08:32.388 --> 08:33.388
<i>Oh, good.</i>

08:33.472 --> 08:35.347
I need to talk to you about something.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.477
Why didn't you tell me about Valentina?

08:39.520 --> 08:41.730
<i>I know she cheated on you.
I know she snitched.</i>

08:41.813 --> 08:44.150
That goddamn cop came to me,
and tried to flip me!

08:44.232 --> 08:45.902
<i>I'm sorry, Pop.</i>

08:45.985 --> 08:48.195
I know, I know I should've told you,

08:49.322 --> 08:51.157
but she screwed up so bad.

08:52.450 --> 08:53.867
And you swore.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.580
<i>You swore on Mum's grave
you'd protect her, remember?</i>

08:58.288 --> 08:59.498
And I will.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.667
And don't say a word to Dom, please.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.628
Cos you know what he's gonna say.

09:04.712 --> 09:07.005
Hey, hey! Don't worry. It'll be fine.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.133
But you gotta be careful
what you say from now on.

09:09.217 --> 09:12.387
<i>That cop's got you bugged.
She even played me the damn recording.</i>

09:12.470 --> 09:14.638
That's why I had Bobby give you his phone.

09:14.722 --> 09:15.890
<i>OK, Pop.</i>

09:15.973 --> 09:18.058
I'm sorry for all of this.

09:18.142 --> 09:20.435
Hey, you wanna talk to Adamo?

09:20.937 --> 09:22.480
Hang on!

09:23.188 --> 09:25.942
There's my little birthday boy!

09:26.025 --> 09:28.277
Very excited about his big day.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.697
You wanna speak to your daddy?

09:31.363 --> 09:33.698
Oh wow!

09:33.782 --> 09:35.952
Nats, Adamo can hear you now.

09:36.035 --> 09:39.413
<i>Is that my beautiful boy I hear there?
It's your papa!</i>

09:39.497 --> 09:41.540
You're one years old today!

09:44.377 --> 09:46.128
You came...

09:47.212 --> 09:49.173
You came into our world one year ago.

09:49.257 --> 09:51.842
You made your mother and I
the luckiest two people in the world.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.678
<i>Sorry I can't be there for you, big guy!</i>

09:55.553 --> 09:57.390
<i>I love you, buddy.</i>

09:59.183 --> 10:01.060
I love you so much.

10:02.353 --> 10:05.438
<i>OK, Adamo.
Now we say "Bye-bye, Papa!"</i>

10:05.522 --> 10:06.773
I wanna talk to him.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.233
You wanna talk to Val?

10:08.317 --> 10:11.112
No, I gotta go, Pop. I love you.

10:14.198 --> 10:17.075
Oh! Wow!

10:21.413 --> 10:23.165
<i>I wanted to talk to him.</i>

10:23.248 --> 10:25.333
Why would he wanna talk to you?

10:27.168 --> 10:30.255
Sorry. Let's just get through today.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.342
We're gonna need some more chairs.
I'll get them from the garage.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.260
Enzo.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.348
Who else knows?

10:39.432 --> 10:40.473
What?

10:40.557 --> 10:42.058
Did you tell Domenic?

10:42.142 --> 10:43.727
No, Val.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.312
OK.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.690
What if the cop
gives the tapes to Domenic?

10:47.773 --> 10:49.376
They tried to squeeze you.
They might try...

10:49.400 --> 10:50.961
- I don't have time for this!
- What about the twins?

10:50.985 --> 10:52.110
Shut up!

10:53.153 --> 10:55.113
I don't like talking to the cops
about you.

10:55.197 --> 10:58.783
I don't like talking to my son in jail
about you.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.203
We have one job to do today,
and that's to have this party.

11:01.287 --> 11:04.332
Can you do this
without making it all about you?

11:04.415 --> 11:06.542
I don't wanna raise this boy alone
by myself

11:06.625 --> 11:08.085
for the rest of my life!

11:09.378 --> 11:12.130
And I don't have to do that
because I made a mistake, Enzo.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.507
It's your job!

11:13.590 --> 11:16.802
I have to do that
because your son killed somebody.

11:17.762 --> 11:20.222
And he did that because you sell drugs

11:20.305 --> 11:23.433
and you beat people up
and God knows what else for a living.

11:23.517 --> 11:24.727
That's why!

11:27.270 --> 11:28.438
Careful.

11:34.153 --> 11:35.863
I know how much you love your grandson.

11:35.947 --> 11:39.450
So, you're right,
let's just get through this day.

11:46.707 --> 11:48.292
The chairs are in the study.

12:01.305 --> 12:03.557
- Where's the stash?
- Trunk.

12:14.693 --> 12:15.778
Boys.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.872
You know, the absence
of your usual sunny disposition

12:26.955 --> 12:29.125
is telling me you got a bug up your ass.

12:29.208 --> 12:31.543
I bet I know what it is. Can I guess?

12:31.627 --> 12:35.088
Now that the Irish
are no longer playing this game.

12:35.172 --> 12:36.590
You're welcome.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.843
You've just inherited
a whole new swath of territory.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.637
I was expecting a thank you.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.388
But instead,

12:43.472 --> 12:46.558
what do I get?
I get this Gandalf scowl from you?

12:46.642 --> 12:49.145
You should be walking
on the sunny side of the street, Alex.

12:49.228 --> 12:51.813
You're thinking
"Well, if he's wiped out the Irish,

12:51.897 --> 12:53.482
maybe he's coming for me next."

12:53.565 --> 12:55.608
The answer to that question is no.

12:56.485 --> 12:58.862
We are in this together.

12:58.945 --> 13:01.407
We are the only two guys

13:01.490 --> 13:04.660
who know what the hell is really going on.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.328
We're not the Irish.

13:07.497 --> 13:10.373
So if I wanna talk to someone,
I talk to who I want.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.127
You wanna negotiate with me?

13:13.210 --> 13:15.212
I mean,
you've got the sweetest deal in town.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.172
Our numbers stand!

13:17.255 --> 13:18.840
No, I just wanna remind you

13:18.923 --> 13:22.052
this is and will always be our home.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.638
No one, no one will push us out.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.140
<i>Très bien! Bon!</i>

13:27.223 --> 13:30.352
But you're tense. I feel it in your bones.

13:30.435 --> 13:32.062
Your boys can feel it.

13:32.145 --> 13:34.898
Relax, get a massage,
paint your toenails red.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.360
How's the purity?

13:38.443 --> 13:39.945
90%, as always.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.032
See you next week, I guess.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.702
Yeah. Hey, stay smart.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.037
Mm-hmm.

13:51.207 --> 13:53.458
Test the whole shipment.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.003
I don't want to put
any crap on the market.

14:19.150 --> 14:22.195
Bastard!
He cut it way too much.

14:25.615 --> 14:27.660
Get the twins on the phone.

14:29.287 --> 14:31.205
Rose, hey.

14:33.207 --> 14:35.960
Um, I hate to ask,

14:36.043 --> 14:37.962
but I need you to do something for me.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.213
I want you to go to Bobby

14:40.297 --> 14:43.258
and ask him for me
to break his protection on Nats.

14:44.092 --> 14:47.262
Um, Bobby won't break protection.
That's his word.

14:47.345 --> 14:48.805
I need him to do that.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.433
Why do you need that?

14:51.517 --> 14:53.643
You wanna get Teresa and Christian

14:53.727 --> 14:54.895
for what they did to Wes?

14:54.978 --> 14:57.022
This is how we're gonna do it.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.440
Don't play me.

14:58.523 --> 15:01.902
Don't make this about Wes.
It's about your business.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.070
I don't play, Rose, and I don't lie.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.697
This is about me,

15:05.780 --> 15:07.490
but this is the piece

15:07.573 --> 15:10.160
that'll knock their legs
right out from under them.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.453
And we both will get what we want.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.002
Well, Bobby won't talk to me.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.545
He won't even see me,
so I'm no help there.

15:21.213 --> 15:23.090
You're gonna have to ask him yourself.
Sorry.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.717
Sorry to hear that.

15:38.188 --> 15:39.732
Listen,

15:39.815 --> 15:41.317
no trouble.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.360
Enz, take it ease, alright?
You were right.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.030
This is the first grandchild
in the family. Let's celebrate.

15:49.450 --> 15:50.492
There she is!

15:50.575 --> 15:52.828
Valentina, wow! Look at you!

15:52.912 --> 15:54.455
You look beautiful.

15:56.207 --> 15:57.457
Thank you.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.125
This is for you.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.253
What's this?

16:01.337 --> 16:03.463
Well, I don't want you worrying
about anything.

16:03.547 --> 16:06.175
You got a lot to deal with.
So we're gonna take care of you.

16:07.258 --> 16:09.387
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:09.470 --> 16:10.720
- Val!
- Luca!

16:10.803 --> 16:12.682
You're a knock out! Look at you.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.602
- Now, where's my godson?
- Outside with Lucia.

16:20.188 --> 16:22.482
- Let me take your coat.
- No, coat's good, thank you.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.818
- I'll get you some wine.
- Yeah, maybe later.

16:24.902 --> 16:26.737
I'm good. I can take care of myself.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.655
You, uh, you enjoy your day.

16:35.453 --> 16:37.247
You see? Everything's fine.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.505
<i>My brother and I are happy
you are open to a discussion.</i>

16:45.588 --> 16:47.632
Alright, what are you offering?

16:47.717 --> 16:51.637
Well, we are opening
five fentanyl-production locations,

16:51.720 --> 16:55.682
and we want you and your men
to run them, protect them,

16:55.765 --> 16:58.352
and control distribution across Quebec.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.937
I heard your first batch
didn't go so well.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.775
Understand what we are offering, Alex.

17:04.858 --> 17:07.068
I can hire chemists, too, you know.

17:07.152 --> 17:11.073
Yes, but you are now
only purchasing cocaine from Declan.

17:11.156 --> 17:14.617
Now that the Irish are gone,
you are well-positioned

17:14.702 --> 17:18.663
to control distribution
across all of Quebec.

17:18.747 --> 17:20.915
We were here before you,

17:20.998 --> 17:23.167
and we'll be here after you.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.880
<i>So don't think about doing to us
what you did to Declan.</i>

17:26.963 --> 17:28.173
<i>Am I clear?</i>

17:28.257 --> 17:30.508
We want partners, not, uh, adversaries.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.303
When we settle on numbers,
we'll give a try.

17:33.387 --> 17:35.180
<i>For both of our businesses,</i>

17:35.263 --> 17:37.432
we want you to take care of Declan.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.477
<i>You know the roads.
The territory is yours.</i>

17:40.560 --> 17:43.063
<i>If anyone can find him, it's you.</i>

17:43.147 --> 17:47.317
You do this,
and everything we promised will be yours.

17:53.615 --> 17:54.992
Deal.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.910
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

18:02.875 --> 18:06.295
Mmm! Valentina,
you gotta tell me this recipe.

18:06.378 --> 18:07.963
- Insomnia!
- It's beautiful.

18:08.047 --> 18:09.590
I stirred it off and on since dawn.

18:09.673 --> 18:12.758
Come over here. Try this.
Valentina made the risotto.

18:12.843 --> 18:14.427
- No, no, no.
- It's fantastic.

18:14.512 --> 18:16.095
I'm dairy-free. I can't do it.

18:16.180 --> 18:17.807
Try it! Have some respect!

18:17.890 --> 18:20.517
Try it! Beautiful!

18:20.600 --> 18:22.602
<i>- Que bueno!
- </i> It's really good.

18:23.395 --> 18:24.522
You didn't make this.

18:24.605 --> 18:26.063
Yes, I did!

18:26.148 --> 18:27.398
No, you didn't. It's too good!

18:29.527 --> 18:31.027
What are you guys doing here?

18:31.820 --> 18:34.113
There's a birthday in your family.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.532
Where else would we be?

18:35.615 --> 18:37.117
No, no, no, you shouldn't be here.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.618
This isn't a good idea.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.953
- Is that them?
- Yeah, it's them.

18:41.037 --> 18:43.207
- No, I don't want them here.
- No, calm down.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.290
Please, get them out!

18:44.332 --> 18:45.583
Just be nice.

18:45.667 --> 18:47.168
Val...

18:47.878 --> 18:50.380
Uh, this is Teresa and Christian.

18:51.382 --> 18:53.342
It's a pleasure to meet you finally.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.593
I know this is a difficult time,

18:55.677 --> 18:58.555
but my family has been through
the same thing.

18:59.388 --> 19:02.977
And if we all stick together,
we can get through this.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.603
For, uh, Adamo.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.608
Please, eat, make yourselves at home.

19:09.692 --> 19:10.817
Thank you.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.403
Ain't this a surprise.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.073
And this must be the birthday boy!

19:18.075 --> 19:19.367
May I hold him?

19:20.327 --> 19:22.287
Val, is that OK?

19:23.622 --> 19:25.082
Sure.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.833
Thank you.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.378
Ah!

19:30.462 --> 19:32.338
Oh, hello!

19:32.422 --> 19:34.800
You are very handsome.

19:36.260 --> 19:39.095
Oh! He has your eyes.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.055
So beautiful.

19:43.142 --> 19:44.685
Lovely home you have.

19:46.312 --> 19:48.772
I'm really sorry about Wes.

19:49.648 --> 19:51.567
Really sorry. How you managing?

19:51.650 --> 19:53.152
Keepin' on.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.322
What did you come by for?

19:57.405 --> 19:59.365
I want you to break protection on Nats.

20:02.202 --> 20:04.078
You know I can't break protection.

20:04.162 --> 20:07.415
- I know, but this is different.
- I gave my word.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.627
I haven't told Nats
you're hiding out on my reserve,

20:09.710 --> 20:11.837
and his family
would really like to know that.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.005
I wouldn't ask if we didn't need it.

20:14.088 --> 20:16.592
This is how I'm gonna get
the people who killed your son.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.262
The day that Wes died,

20:20.345 --> 20:22.973
Nats was sitting right here
next to me in jail.

20:23.057 --> 20:24.767
It's not about Nats.

20:24.850 --> 20:27.102
It's about his family.

20:27.185 --> 20:28.937
They're responsible.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.147
You wanna see them just walk away?

20:31.230 --> 20:33.108
I didn't ask you to do anything.

20:33.192 --> 20:36.653
Bobby, if I didn't know you personally,
or Rose or Wes,

20:36.737 --> 20:38.697
I'd still ask you the same thing.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.615
This is not an offer of charity.

20:40.698 --> 20:42.993
Your beautiful boy is dead.

20:43.077 --> 20:44.620
He's not coming back.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.872
You help me with this,

20:48.582 --> 20:50.167
and I'll get 'em all.

20:50.958 --> 20:52.168
I promise you that.

20:53.337 --> 20:54.797
All of them.

20:56.340 --> 20:59.342
Protection don't mean anything
if someone can buy it out from under you.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.638
I'm sorry, brother.

21:03.722 --> 21:05.807
I'm not gonna talk about this anymore.

21:07.350 --> 21:08.560
OK.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.313
From me to you, though, friend to friend.

21:13.315 --> 21:14.817
Talk to Rose.

21:15.525 --> 21:18.653
She's in a world of pain.
This ain't on her. You gotta let it go.

21:20.072 --> 21:22.032
I've known you a long time, Declan.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.075
The one thing I know

21:24.868 --> 21:26.453
is you don't let anything go.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.580
That's why you are who you are.

21:35.337 --> 21:36.880
Thanks for the liquorice.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.507
No problem.

21:48.100 --> 21:51.227
We made a partnership
with the Devil's Kings.

21:51.310 --> 21:55.482
We will be setting up
our new fentanyl labs in Quebec,

21:55.565 --> 21:57.525
and they will be in charge of

21:57.608 --> 22:00.153
protecting them and distribution.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.323
So, you're going outside the family?

22:03.407 --> 22:04.950
When everything is in place,

22:05.033 --> 22:07.702
Luca will move to Montreal
and be our go-between.

22:07.785 --> 22:10.747
You will coordinate with them
on whatever they need.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.665
You think I'm gonna work for the bikers?

22:12.748 --> 22:15.627
If you want to be involved, yes, we do.

22:15.710 --> 22:19.047
You must be out of your goddamn mind,

22:19.130 --> 22:21.090
cos I'm not working for no bikers.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.593
You make a deal with them
without talking to us?

22:23.677 --> 22:25.637
We need to move forward.

22:25.720 --> 22:29.057
And since you all failed
at the job we gave you,

22:29.140 --> 22:30.683
we found other options.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.227
Can't trust the bikers.

22:32.310 --> 22:34.813
Well, they have agreed
to find and kill Declan for us.

22:34.897 --> 22:36.398
They are eager partners now.

22:36.482 --> 22:39.608
And if they're no good, we replace them
just like we would any employee.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.693
Simple.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.820
Why don't you have them over for dinner?

22:42.903 --> 22:44.530
Give them the house too.

22:44.613 --> 22:48.033
OK, it's my godson's birthday
in my cousin's house

22:48.118 --> 22:49.745
who is in prison because of you two.

22:49.828 --> 22:51.955
I don't wanna hear about
any of this no more.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.123
Luca.

22:59.838 --> 23:02.757
Hey. I might have something here.

23:04.050 --> 23:06.762
- What am I looking at?
- This was at the church lab.

23:06.845 --> 23:08.763
Now, remember the first time
I saw the twins?

23:08.847 --> 23:10.640
I think that's the same lighter.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.767
If it is, we can get to them.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.772
Call the RCMP liaison in Italy.

23:17.855 --> 23:20.650
They have passports, so their fingerprints
will be on file there.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.277
Good work, Kenny!

23:22.360 --> 23:23.653
Thank you!

23:32.203 --> 23:33.622
What are you doing here?

23:33.705 --> 23:35.790
You left our conversation early.

23:36.290 --> 23:38.918
I'm not gonna take no orders
from no dirty bikers.

23:39.002 --> 23:41.463
You are not taking orders from them.

23:41.547 --> 23:43.715
You are taking orders from me.

23:45.342 --> 23:46.425
Luca,

23:47.218 --> 23:49.178
you are the one that I trust,

23:49.805 --> 23:51.013
not them.

23:53.475 --> 23:57.478
I know the future
that you see for yourself.

23:58.563 --> 24:00.815
The reason I am giving you a second chance

24:00.898 --> 24:02.275
is because I see it too.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.238
This reaches me and only me.

24:07.322 --> 24:09.365
If you have problems, you call me.

24:11.952 --> 24:13.537
If I call you,

24:14.997 --> 24:16.455
you answer.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.753
Now, I'm not forcing this on you.

24:22.712 --> 24:24.338
If you want,

24:25.423 --> 24:27.050
you can walk away.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.475
Do you want to walk away, Luca?

24:58.873 --> 25:01.083
<i>♪ Happy birthday ♪</i>

25:01.167 --> 25:03.670
<i>♪ to you</i> ♪

25:05.338 --> 25:07.007
OK, how about some cake?

25:07.090 --> 25:08.925
I'd like to say something.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.135
- Maybe a little later.
- No, I wanna say something.

25:11.218 --> 25:14.347
Thank you, everybody, for coming,

25:14.430 --> 25:15.890
my friends, my family...

25:15.973 --> 25:17.808
- Let's go.
- No, let's stay.

25:17.892 --> 25:21.062
You all know these past few weeks
have been very, very hard.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.605
It's true.

25:22.688 --> 25:26.192
And it's hard to be joyous
in a time like this,

25:26.275 --> 25:28.778
uh, but we have to.

25:28.862 --> 25:30.947
We have to, I have to, for my son,

25:31.030 --> 25:33.325
because he needs everyone in this room.

25:33.408 --> 25:35.410
And we all love you and Adamo very much!

25:35.493 --> 25:37.120
And I'm sorry.

25:38.622 --> 25:40.248
I am so sorry.

25:40.332 --> 25:42.667
I'm, I'm not perfect.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.837
You know, I made mistakes.

25:48.130 --> 25:51.927
But I swear, the only thing
I care about in this life is you.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.722
And your father loves you so much.

25:57.098 --> 25:59.850
You know what,
I've never known a man who loves his child

25:59.935 --> 26:01.603
as much as he does,

26:01.687 --> 26:03.605
except maybe his father.

26:04.438 --> 26:06.858
No, that's where he learned it from.

26:06.942 --> 26:09.402
But your father's not here,

26:09.485 --> 26:11.738
so, uh, I will be both

26:11.822 --> 26:14.032
mother and father to you.

26:14.115 --> 26:15.783
I'll protect you...

26:18.662 --> 26:19.912
Love you,

26:21.665 --> 26:24.375
and never ever leave you
for the rest of your life.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.212
I promise.

26:31.007 --> 26:34.343
OK! How about that cake, everyone?

26:34.427 --> 26:36.345
Kids first, come on.

26:38.682 --> 26:40.225
Hey.

26:40.308 --> 26:41.392
Thank you.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.443
- Guess who came to dinner?
- You got them?

26:51.527 --> 26:53.530
<i>Family's having a party,
and they showed up.</i>

26:53.613 --> 26:55.907
And they're only in one car today.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.410
The tide turns, my friend.

26:58.493 --> 26:59.577
Don't lose 'em.

26:59.660 --> 27:01.078
Ah, I won't.

27:08.462 --> 27:10.588
He's on his way. What's the matter?

27:10.672 --> 27:12.673
Ah, it's all good.
Just wanna have a quick chat.

27:12.757 --> 27:14.383
- What is it?
- Yeah, close the door.

27:16.427 --> 27:18.763
So, you're watching
what I'm watching, right, Enzo?

27:18.847 --> 27:20.765
She's losing it, you know, a little bit.

27:20.848 --> 27:22.683
Wait a minute. We're not doing this, OK?

27:22.767 --> 27:24.977
I'm just saying she's gonna cry again.

27:25.062 --> 27:27.772
She's fine!
What are we talking about this again for?

27:27.855 --> 27:29.523
I made a promise to Nats. That's that!

27:29.607 --> 27:31.233
No, your son lied to you.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.902
Any promise you made, it doesn't hold.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.820
Listen, Enzo,
let me talk to you for a second.

27:34.903 --> 27:37.323
I know
this is an impossible situation for you.

27:37.407 --> 27:39.742
I know. I'm your brother.
I understand that.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.870
I'm just saying let me take this burden,

27:41.953 --> 27:43.622
this decision, off your shoulders.

27:43.705 --> 27:45.457
Listen to me, if we kill her,

27:45.540 --> 27:47.917
it's gonna look like
we tried to shut her up.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.918
What? Look like it to who?

27:50.002 --> 27:51.503
- The cops!
- The cops?

27:51.587 --> 27:53.213
Why the hell would the cops think that?

27:53.297 --> 27:56.092
We just make it look like an accident.
Enzo, why'd you say that?

27:56.175 --> 27:57.468
They're gonna know.

27:57.552 --> 27:59.095
Why are they gonna know?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.558
- Enzo, why are they gonna know?
- The cops...

28:03.642 --> 28:04.642
Yeah?

28:05.685 --> 28:07.395
Why they gonna know?

28:08.980 --> 28:11.273
They know we know Valentina's a snitch.

28:15.612 --> 28:17.113
How do they know, Enz?

28:19.823 --> 28:21.617
How do they know, Enz?

28:21.700 --> 28:24.662
Valentina's cop paid me a visit.
She told me.

28:25.538 --> 28:26.622
What?

28:29.625 --> 28:31.168
Pops, I swear I don't know nothing.

28:32.003 --> 28:33.422
Wait a minute.

28:33.505 --> 28:36.215
So, you already knew
that Valentina was a snitch?

28:37.008 --> 28:39.385
The cop wanted to flip me,
and I told her to kiss my ass!

28:39.468 --> 28:42.680
When I played you that awful tape,
what did you do?

28:42.763 --> 28:44.348
You just pretended you didn't know?

28:44.932 --> 28:47.643
Enzo... Enzo is that what happened?

28:47.727 --> 28:49.228
She didn't say anything to hurt us!

28:49.312 --> 28:50.855
Well, how do you know that?

28:50.938 --> 28:52.065
Answer me!

28:52.773 --> 28:54.400
Answer me, Enzo! How do you know that?

28:54.483 --> 28:56.318
I confronted Val!

29:02.408 --> 29:04.618
Tell me you're joking.
You can't be serious.

29:04.702 --> 29:05.828
He's not serious.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.038
Dom, I went at her hard. I'm telling you!

29:08.998 --> 29:12.668
She gave them nothing!
They have nothing, trust me!

29:13.377 --> 29:15.338
We just have to, like, leave it!

29:15.422 --> 29:16.630
That's it!

29:18.048 --> 29:19.300
You lied to me?

29:19.383 --> 29:22.023
- You're not looking at it the right way.
- You lied to me for her?

29:22.095 --> 29:23.597
Not for her, for everybody.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.848
- Our whole life, you never lied to me.
- That's true.

29:25.932 --> 29:27.767
- So what do you do?
- I needed to!

29:27.850 --> 29:29.477
You're choosing her over me.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.522
You're choosing her over my son,
you're choosing her over our family?

29:32.605 --> 29:36.025
- You don't understand! It's my family!
- Shut up and listen. Lower your voice!

29:36.108 --> 29:38.778
Lower your goddamn voice, Enz! Enz.

29:40.697 --> 29:43.032
If we don't go to jail because of her,

29:43.115 --> 29:46.243
what do you think's gonna happen
when the big bosses back home find out?

29:46.327 --> 29:48.663
Do you understand?
What are you not getting, Enzo?

29:49.622 --> 29:51.248
We're all gonna be dead.

29:51.917 --> 29:53.042
Dead!

29:53.125 --> 29:54.335
Got it?

29:56.253 --> 29:57.422
Ah!

30:02.760 --> 30:05.680
- Dom...
- Enz. Please, Enz.

30:06.848 --> 30:09.183
I've never gone against your word
my whole life,

30:09.933 --> 30:12.145
even when I disagreed.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.232
This is the one time
you gotta listen to me.

30:17.692 --> 30:19.568
We will not touch her.

30:22.280 --> 30:25.492
Come on, Dom. I gotta hear you say it.

30:33.457 --> 30:34.958
I'll tell you what, um...

30:35.877 --> 30:37.420
When they come for us,

30:37.503 --> 30:40.130
and believe me, Enz,
it's just a matter of time,

30:40.965 --> 30:43.050
I hope they kill you last

30:43.133 --> 30:45.762
so you can see all the damage you done.

30:52.477 --> 30:54.395
You broke my heart, Enz.

31:01.945 --> 31:03.112
Luca, let's go.

31:04.822 --> 31:06.865
Alright, let's go back to the party.

31:13.748 --> 31:16.250
Enzo, let's go.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.633
<i>What do you want, boy?</i>

31:23.717 --> 31:25.175
<i>I'm not here</i>

31:25.260 --> 31:27.428
<i>to help you get clean, Lonny.</i>

31:27.512 --> 31:29.013
<i>I'm here to help you suffer.</i>

31:30.765 --> 31:31.975
Hey.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.143
Declan.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.147
Hey.

31:44.278 --> 31:46.447
I tried talking with him yesterday.

31:46.530 --> 31:48.532
He doesn't seem all there.

31:48.617 --> 31:50.158
Yeah.

31:50.242 --> 31:51.618
He's been through a lot,

31:51.702 --> 31:53.537
but I'm gonna help him out of it.

32:00.420 --> 32:01.920
Hey. We're going for a ride.

32:02.005 --> 32:04.465
- Where?
- Get in.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.597
Thanks for coming. Drive safe.

32:11.305 --> 32:13.515
I wanna put him to bed.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.113
It was a great party.

32:30.617 --> 32:32.410
Everything's gonna be alright, Val.

32:33.327 --> 32:34.953
I saw you guys.

32:35.788 --> 32:37.040
Talking.

32:38.248 --> 32:39.917
Always talking.

32:40.543 --> 32:43.295
- You think you're so smart?
- Val, what are you talking about?

32:43.378 --> 32:45.340
What were you talking about in the garage?

32:47.175 --> 32:48.677
Nothing.

32:48.760 --> 32:50.260
Nothing.

32:50.345 --> 32:53.430
When you guys say, "nothing",
it's always a something.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.600
What is it?

32:59.853 --> 33:01.355
You know, don't you?

33:02.357 --> 33:04.400
You should go to bed.

33:07.862 --> 33:08.863
You all know.

33:08.947 --> 33:10.365
Be quiet, Val.

33:10.448 --> 33:13.117
- What's gonna happen to me?
- Nothing's gonna happen to you.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.868
- Luca!
- Go to sleep.

33:14.952 --> 33:18.538
Luca, don't bullshit me.
I know what's going on.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.583
Don't talk about anything.

33:21.667 --> 33:24.920
You don't know anything, OK?

33:26.713 --> 33:27.882
Come on.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.345
Come on. Go lie down.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.640
I miss Nats.

33:37.725 --> 33:39.143
You think he misses me?

33:39.227 --> 33:40.437
Of course!

33:41.437 --> 33:42.605
He loves you.

33:42.688 --> 33:43.732
I know.

33:53.323 --> 33:54.867
What are we doing here?

33:56.743 --> 34:00.205
My old man, he died a few days ago.

34:01.915 --> 34:03.500
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

34:03.583 --> 34:05.210
That piece of shit

34:05.795 --> 34:08.088
was the reason me and you lost your mum.

34:08.172 --> 34:09.922
Be happy he's dead.

34:12.302 --> 34:15.763
I didn't see him for 25 years, at least.

34:15.847 --> 34:17.681
I didn't think about him.
I forgot about him.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.225
He was nothing to me.

34:20.141 --> 34:21.351
But as I got older,

34:21.435 --> 34:23.897
I realized
I never forgot about him at all.

34:23.980 --> 34:26.523
And he was still right up in there.

34:28.317 --> 34:31.695
I saw his face,
heard his voice, his stink.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.949
Five years ago, I looked for him.

34:36.033 --> 34:37.827
When I found him, I went to visit him.

34:38.618 --> 34:41.205
Not to get amends, no apologies.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.456
I wanted to make him suffer.

34:45.460 --> 34:48.253
And that is when he left up here.

34:48.337 --> 34:51.507
Poof!
Gone, like a crumbled up piece of paper.

34:53.092 --> 34:55.217
And now that he's really gone,

34:55.302 --> 34:57.222
I don't feel nothing.

34:59.973 --> 35:03.477
The man who ran the foster home
that you grew up in,

35:03.560 --> 35:05.522
the guy who beat you

35:05.605 --> 35:08.232
and abused you and spit on you,

35:09.483 --> 35:12.027
he lives right over there, Reggie,
in that house.

35:22.997 --> 35:24.332
Why are we here?

35:24.415 --> 35:25.917
Cos you're gonna go in there,

35:26.000 --> 35:28.502
and you're gonna make him take back
all the shit he did to you.

35:29.503 --> 35:30.505
Speak of the devil.

35:30.588 --> 35:33.382
- That's him, right? Is that him?
- No, I don't want to.

35:34.508 --> 35:36.260
It's OK, I'm right here.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.595
- You go do what you gotta do.
- I wanna leave.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.180
- No, no.
- We can go!

35:40.263 --> 35:43.433
No, you gotta go in there, Reg.
You gotta show him who you are.

35:43.517 --> 35:46.187
You gotta show him
what a piece of garbage he really is

35:46.270 --> 35:48.982
and make him regret
his whole useless life.

35:50.107 --> 35:52.025
He's just an old man.

35:52.108 --> 35:53.987
He's not just an old man. He's a monster.

35:55.278 --> 35:57.240
Reggie, are you scared
to look at the house?

35:57.323 --> 35:59.617
Don't be scared.
I don't want you to be scared anymore.

35:59.700 --> 36:00.743
It was a long time ago.

36:00.827 --> 36:02.662
No, it's not. It's now. You gotta fix it.

36:02.745 --> 36:03.955
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

36:04.038 --> 36:05.540
- I just can't.
- Yes, you can!

36:05.623 --> 36:07.292
You don't even know me, man!

36:08.167 --> 36:09.585
I'm not like you!

36:12.422 --> 36:13.965
I'm sorry.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.802
Look, I know you're trying to help me.

36:17.885 --> 36:20.137
I totally get it. But listen to me.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.848
Just having somebody want to help me,

36:23.390 --> 36:26.018
that's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

36:27.437 --> 36:30.732
OK? That's all I need!

36:32.817 --> 36:34.110
Thank you.

36:34.193 --> 36:36.070
I mean that.

36:36.153 --> 36:38.113
I'm so sorry

36:39.073 --> 36:41.075
for everything you had to go through.

36:44.037 --> 36:45.913
That must've been so hard.

36:47.707 --> 36:51.085
I wish you had someone like I got you.

36:58.592 --> 37:00.093
Hey.

37:01.637 --> 37:03.430
Come on, let's go home. Come on.

37:19.822 --> 37:21.073
Sleep it off.

37:21.157 --> 37:22.992
You'll feel better in the morning.

37:23.075 --> 37:24.452
You know what?

37:24.535 --> 37:26.412
Marrying into your family

37:26.495 --> 37:28.998
didn't turn out the way
I thought it would.

37:57.318 --> 37:58.318
Gotcha.

38:35.522 --> 38:38.275
Val, you OK?

38:38.358 --> 38:39.360
Val?

38:40.068 --> 38:41.528
Pop, what are you doing in here?

38:41.612 --> 38:43.947
- Shhh! Shhh! Don't wake the baby.
- Is she OK?

38:44.907 --> 38:45.908
Val?

38:46.742 --> 38:49.703
Val. Val, are you OK?

38:49.787 --> 38:51.163
Val!

38:56.335 --> 38:57.962
What, what did you do?

38:58.045 --> 38:59.755
- I'm not gonna...
- What did you do?

38:59.838 --> 39:01.590
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

39:01.673 --> 39:02.673
No!

39:02.717 --> 39:04.343
What's going on?

39:04.427 --> 39:05.845
No!

39:07.303 --> 39:09.682
What's wrong with her? Is she OK?

39:29.118 --> 39:31.912
I had no choice, Enzo. It had to be done.

39:35.415 --> 39:37.125
You need to go home.

39:38.168 --> 39:40.462
You're gonna come back.

39:40.545 --> 39:42.338
Gotta change your clothes.

39:42.423 --> 39:43.548
And, uh...

39:45.467 --> 39:47.385
call the cops in the morning.

39:49.972 --> 39:51.723
Report her missing.

40:05.195 --> 40:07.155
I did it for all of us, Enzo.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.345
You have every right
to be angry with me.

40:30.220 --> 40:33.390
I promised you I'd take care of Wes.
But this isn't about that.

40:34.392 --> 40:36.435
I already told Declan
I made the commitment.

40:36.518 --> 40:39.397
You don't think if Nats had a chance
to reunite with his son,

40:39.480 --> 40:40.647
he wouldn't sell you out?

40:42.525 --> 40:43.942
They know which side they're on.

40:44.025 --> 40:46.028
Declan and I know which side we're on.

40:47.112 --> 40:50.032
- Declan is not doing this for us.
- I know.

40:51.075 --> 40:53.327
We have to do this for us.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.100
You messing with my flowers?

41:17.183 --> 41:18.560
They needed a little help.

41:19.478 --> 41:21.022
I spoke to Bobby.

41:22.773 --> 41:24.148
Really?

41:24.817 --> 41:27.110
- Couldn't have been easy.
- It wasn't.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.903
Probably never will be.

41:30.572 --> 41:32.700
But he sees things our way now,

41:32.783 --> 41:34.993
and you now own
Nats' protection contract.

41:36.662 --> 41:38.788
So whatever you got planned, better work.

41:38.872 --> 41:40.332
It will.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.007
<i>I want you to get rid of her car.</i>

41:48.090 --> 41:50.675

42:07.568 --> 42:09.862

42:09.945 --> 42:11.863

42:11.947 --> 42:13.532

42:42.978 --> 42:46.565
I'm at the house right now.
She's gone, and her car's gone.

42:47.482 --> 42:49.777
But her baby's here all alone,

42:49.860 --> 42:52.028
and she would have never
have left the baby.

42:52.112 --> 42:53.613

43:13.217 --> 43:16.262
Walk back to your car.
This is private property.

43:16.345 --> 43:17.722
I just wanna talk.

43:25.728 --> 43:26.813
What about?

43:26.897 --> 43:28.815
We got some mutual interests to discuss.

43:28.898 --> 43:32.360
Like what? Kidnapping? Fentanyl house?

43:33.778 --> 43:35.113
Take a seat?

43:37.658 --> 43:39.033
If you wanna be my CI,

43:39.117 --> 43:40.827
we can continue this down at my office.

43:41.912 --> 43:43.580
It's not my style.

43:43.663 --> 43:45.332
What do you want?

43:45.415 --> 43:49.168
One day soon,
a gift will be presented to you.

43:49.252 --> 43:52.047
It's gonna drop on your lap.
Don't question it.

43:53.048 --> 43:54.967
Are you offering me a bribe?

43:55.050 --> 43:56.510
I wouldn't dare.

43:57.343 --> 43:59.513
Just here to tell you
that you're on the right track.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.557
Everything's gonna happen for you soon.

44:06.395 --> 44:08.355
You didn't have to tell me any of this.

44:08.438 --> 44:10.107
Why are you really here?

44:10.190 --> 44:12.567
I wanted to meet you,

44:12.650 --> 44:14.528
see what kind of a person you really are.

44:15.778 --> 44:17.363
And what kind am I?

44:17.447 --> 44:20.325
Just like me. The kind that likes to win.

44:28.667 --> 44:30.210
<i>Next time on </i> Bad Blood:

44:30.293 --> 44:31.587
Security's top level.

44:31.670 --> 44:32.670
How do I get in?

44:32.755 --> 44:34.590
You two children
are the reason for this mess.

44:34.673 --> 44:36.300
There's only one way to fix this.

44:36.383 --> 44:38.260
A missing person's report was filed

44:38.343 --> 44:40.053
by Enzo Cosoleto for Valentina.

44:40.137 --> 44:42.138
You know who does this,
leaves a baby alone?

44:42.222 --> 44:44.265
Does she have any issues
with mental illness?

44:44.348 --> 44:46.060
Oh yeah. She's depressed.

44:46.143 --> 44:48.353
Hi, Enzo! I came to talk to you.

44:48.437 --> 44:51.815
Cos I believe you're the last
clear-thinking man of your family.

44:51.898 --> 44:53.192
I know where they are.

44:53.275 --> 44:55.568
OK. What's next?

44:55.652 --> 44:57.528
<i>I got one shot at this.</i>

44:57.612 --> 45:00.073
If I miss,
they're gonna send an army at me.
