01:44.763 --> 01:47.464
<i>Part of a wave
of memorials and protests</i>

01:47.466 --> 01:50.901
<i>demanding that the secretive

01:50.903 --> 01:53.336

01:53.338 --> 01:55.607

<i>even more creatures discovered

02:17.464 --> 02:19.664
<i>A historic tragedy

02:19.666 --> 02:21.332
<i>as we know it forever.</i>

02:21.334 --> 02:25.672
<i>The day the world discovered

02:57.437 --> 02:59.837
Shit!

02:59.839 --> 03:03.575
Shit, shit, shit!

03:03.577 --> 03:04.809
- Oh...
- Maddie?

03:04.811 --> 03:05.976
Good morning!

03:05.978 --> 03:07.979
- Good morning, Mom!
- Oh, God!

03:07.981 --> 03:09.279
- Uh...
- Okay.

03:11.118 --> 03:13.752
I made us breakfast.

03:13.754 --> 03:15.720
It's, uh...

03:15.722 --> 03:18.892
Eggs, toast,
and what was once bacon.

03:20.060 --> 03:22.093
And which do you recommend?

03:22.095 --> 03:23.796
The toast and eggs.

03:24.798 --> 03:26.267
Thank you.

03:29.168 --> 03:30.803
Coffee?

03:34.006 --> 03:35.873
What were you working on?

03:35.875 --> 03:37.944
Um, I was looking at recipes.

03:38.512 --> 03:40.014
For toast?

03:42.782 --> 03:45.283
Dad's been emailing me.

03:45.285 --> 03:46.617
But he looks good.

03:46.619 --> 03:47.887
Healthy.

03:50.256 --> 03:51.422
Have you responded?

03:51.424 --> 03:52.891
Not yet.

03:52.893 --> 03:54.625
Madison, I just don't want to
see you get hurt.

03:54.627 --> 03:56.226
I know.

03:56.228 --> 03:57.628
Especially with everything
that's going on right now.

03:57.630 --> 03:59.099
Mom, I know.

04:03.236 --> 04:06.771
Listen, I know things
haven't been easy for you.

04:06.773 --> 04:09.140
But we're gonna
get through this.

04:09.142 --> 04:10.675
Together.

04:10.677 --> 04:13.010
You sure he's gonna be okay?

04:13.012 --> 04:16.815
He is in the safest place
that he could be right now.

04:18.452 --> 04:20.286
You wanna hear some good news?

04:21.853 --> 04:23.621
I finished it.

04:23.623 --> 04:25.159
Really?

04:27.426 --> 04:29.626
You think it's gonna work?

04:29.628 --> 04:31.628
It's gonna work.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.189
It's gonna be okay.

04:56.822 --> 04:57.955
<i>Doctor Russell,</i>

04:57.957 --> 04:59.692
<i>we need you in Containment.</i>

05:00.793 --> 05:02.760
I'm on my way.

05:14.574 --> 05:15.707
<i>What the hell happened?</i>

05:15.709 --> 05:16.840
No idea.

05:16.842 --> 05:18.142
She was sleeping like a baby

05:18.144 --> 05:19.577
until an hour ago,
and then, boom.

05:19.579 --> 05:21.111
Her radiation levels
went through the roof.

05:21.113 --> 05:22.681
Almost like
something triggered it.

05:22.683 --> 05:24.214
Thanks, Tim.

05:24.216 --> 05:25.817
I can take it from here.
Why don't you get some rest?

05:25.819 --> 05:27.217
No way.

05:27.219 --> 05:29.356
Sleep or no sleep,
I'm not missing this.

05:42.902 --> 05:46.236
<i>Containment team,
move into primary position.</i>

05:47.574 --> 05:49.474
- Sedatives?
- No effect.

05:49.476 --> 05:51.812
This thing wants to be born.

05:54.113 --> 05:56.613
<i>Emergency protocol
is in effect.</i>

05:56.615 --> 05:58.616
<i>Ten seconds to biocontainment.</i>

05:58.618 --> 06:00.687
Her time has come.

06:28.548 --> 06:30.847
<i>Meet Titanus mosura.</i>

06:30.849 --> 06:32.349
Or as we like to call her...

06:32.351 --> 06:33.784
Mothra.

06:33.786 --> 06:35.553
Incredible.

06:35.555 --> 06:38.123
<i>Activating containment grid.</i>

06:46.565 --> 06:48.034
<i>- Warning.
- What's happening?</i>

06:51.171 --> 06:52.503
<i>Warning.</i>

06:52.505 --> 06:53.972
Something's really wrong here.

06:53.974 --> 06:55.373
Containment systems
are failing.

06:55.375 --> 06:56.875
Perimeter alarms
are going off,

06:56.877 --> 06:58.308
the whole network's
going insane.

06:58.310 --> 06:59.911
What do you mean?
How is that possible?

06:59.913 --> 07:01.381
Emma, I think someone else
is doing this.

07:05.685 --> 07:07.351
<i>Containment team, stand down.</i>

07:07.353 --> 07:09.423
I repeat, stand down.
You are scaring her.

07:35.548 --> 07:37.114
No!

07:37.116 --> 07:38.082
Doctor Russell, I'm sorry.
But you know the protocols.

07:38.084 --> 07:39.351
We have to terminate!

07:39.353 --> 07:40.353
I'll handle this.

07:42.454 --> 07:43.555
Mom! No!

07:43.557 --> 07:45.526
Madison, stay here.
It's gonna work.

07:50.029 --> 07:51.498
<i>Stand clear.</i>

07:58.505 --> 08:00.307
It's okay.

08:38.277 --> 08:39.345
Mom!

08:45.819 --> 08:47.919
Mom!

08:47.921 --> 08:49.486
Maddie, wait!

08:49.488 --> 08:51.555
Maddie!

08:51.557 --> 08:52.892
Get back in here!

08:54.960 --> 08:56.395
Maddie! Go back!

08:57.863 --> 08:59.099
Mom! Let's go!

09:02.268 --> 09:03.269
Mom!

09:38.570 --> 09:40.804
Son of a bitch.

09:40.806 --> 09:43.142
It worked.

10:39.465 --> 10:40.700
Mom?

10:55.047 --> 10:57.981
What we are witnessing here,
Senators,

10:57.983 --> 11:02.886
is the return of an ancient
and forgotten super species.

11:02.888 --> 11:06.491
Godzilla, the MUTOs, Kong.

11:06.493 --> 11:09.260
We believe that these "Titans"

11:09.262 --> 11:10.693
and others like them

11:10.695 --> 11:13.231
provide an essential balance
to our world.

11:13.233 --> 11:15.232
And while some may
pose a threat,

11:15.234 --> 11:18.602
Monarch is uniquely prepared
to determine

11:18.604 --> 11:21.371
which of these Titans are here
to threaten us

11:21.373 --> 11:24.475
and which of these Titans
are here to protect us.

11:24.477 --> 11:26.943
Thank you for the fifth grade
history lesson, Mr. Coleman.

11:26.945 --> 11:29.847
But we still haven't heard
one good reason

11:29.849 --> 11:32.850
why Monarch shouldn't fall
under military jurisdiction.

11:32.852 --> 11:35.885
Or why these creatures
shouldn't be exterminated.

11:35.887 --> 11:37.554
Monarch was tasked

11:37.556 --> 11:40.692
with finding and destroying
these radioactive monsters.

11:40.694 --> 11:42.927
But you either can't
or won't tell us

11:42.929 --> 11:46.497
how many there are
or why they're showing up.

11:46.499 --> 11:49.467
So, maybe it's time for
the military to put them down.

11:49.469 --> 11:51.534
Killing them
would be a mistake.

11:51.536 --> 11:53.704
They returned because of us.

11:53.706 --> 11:58.009
<i>It was our atomic testing
that awoke Gojira.</i>

11:58.011 --> 12:00.178
Other creatures like the MUTOs

12:00.180 --> 12:03.246
from strip mining
and seismic surveys.

12:03.248 --> 12:05.616
But these are not monsters.

12:05.618 --> 12:07.619
They are animals
rising to reclaim

12:07.621 --> 12:09.285
a world that was once theirs.

12:09.287 --> 12:10.654
It almost sounds like

12:10.656 --> 12:12.756
you're protecting them,
Doctor Serizawa.

12:12.758 --> 12:14.257
As if you admire them.

12:14.259 --> 12:17.361
I admire all forms of life.

12:17.363 --> 12:20.497
Senators,
if we hope to survive,

12:20.499 --> 12:24.201
we must find ways
to coexist with Titans.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.470
<i>With Gojira.</i>

12:26.472 --> 12:28.838
A sort of
symbiotic relationship,

12:28.840 --> 12:30.941
if you will.

12:30.943 --> 12:32.577
Like the lion and the mouse.

12:32.579 --> 12:35.178
Or the scorpion and the frog.

12:35.180 --> 12:37.914
So you'd want to
make Godzilla our pet?

12:37.916 --> 12:39.382
No.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.150
We will be his.

12:46.759 --> 12:48.525
Uh... No. No, actually.

12:48.527 --> 12:50.059
That's not what
Doctor Serizawa meant.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.294
We have to go.

12:51.296 --> 12:52.829
No one is implying
that we would be

12:52.831 --> 12:54.465
- Godzilla's or anyone's pet.
- Sam, we have to go.

12:54.467 --> 12:56.034
Doctor Serizawa,
Doctor Graham,

12:56.036 --> 12:57.367
this hearing is not adjourned.

12:57.369 --> 12:59.703
Doctor Serizawa,
I hope you understand

12:59.705 --> 13:03.406
the consequences
of walking out that door.

13:03.408 --> 13:04.708
Uh, you know what, Senators,

13:04.710 --> 13:06.209
while I confer
with my colleagues here,

13:06.211 --> 13:07.611
I'm gonna set you up
with a very brief

13:07.613 --> 13:09.212
and pretty fun documentary

13:09.214 --> 13:10.948
on Titan reproduction.

13:10.950 --> 13:12.750
I think this is the one where
the genitals are blurred out.

13:12.752 --> 13:16.386
But if not, you can leave
a comment with my assistant.

14:17.816 --> 14:20.049
The feed cuts out there.

14:20.051 --> 14:22.352
The survivors
haven't been able to give us

14:22.354 --> 14:24.688
much more
than what the footage allows.

14:24.690 --> 14:28.428
Only that Emma and Madison
were the only ones taken.

14:29.228 --> 14:30.794
I'm sorry, Mark.

14:30.796 --> 14:33.333
I should've been there
for her.

14:35.134 --> 14:36.299
Who are they?

14:36.301 --> 14:37.570
We don't know yet.

14:39.406 --> 14:41.907
We believe
they were after this.

14:44.910 --> 14:46.043
You didn't.

14:46.045 --> 14:47.510
It's the ORCA.

14:47.512 --> 14:49.112
Uh, that's why we think
they need Emma.

14:49.114 --> 14:51.649
She believed that
if we could somehow replicate

14:51.651 --> 14:53.683
the biosonar the Titans
use to communicate...

14:53.685 --> 14:55.854
I know what the hell it is.
I helped build the prototype.

14:57.123 --> 14:58.555
Who is he?

14:58.557 --> 15:00.890
Uh, Sam Coleman.
I'm the head of technology.

15:00.892 --> 15:03.561
I joined Monarch,
uh, shortly after you left.

15:03.563 --> 15:04.996
I'm a big fan of your wife...

15:04.998 --> 15:06.364
...'s work. And you.

15:06.366 --> 15:08.031
That just came out so weird,
I'm sorry.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.899
Emma and I destroyed
the prototype.

15:09.901 --> 15:12.837
And then Emma decided
to rebuild it.

15:12.839 --> 15:15.271
After San Francisco,
she went home to Boston,

15:15.273 --> 15:16.740
spent years developing it.

15:16.742 --> 15:18.141
She thought it could help...

15:18.143 --> 15:19.543
Would help what? Play God?

15:19.545 --> 15:21.578
No.
Help prevent another attack.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.145
ORCA was a grad school
science project.

15:23.147 --> 15:25.249
It was meant to keep whales
away from the shoreline.

15:25.251 --> 15:27.483
Not so you could talk to your
little creatures out there.

15:27.485 --> 15:30.654
Listen to me, they'll think
it's one of them.

15:30.656 --> 15:33.624
You use the wrong frequency
on one of 'em

15:33.626 --> 15:35.458
and you're
gonna be responsible

15:35.460 --> 15:37.428
for 1,000 San Franciscos.

15:37.430 --> 15:39.864
Which is why we need
to get it back.

15:39.866 --> 15:43.433
Emma always said no one knew
the ORCA better than you.

15:43.435 --> 15:45.635
It shouldn't even exist.

15:45.637 --> 15:47.004
That may be, Mark.

15:47.006 --> 15:48.938
But it's fallen
into the wrong hands.

15:48.940 --> 15:51.476
And right now,
the ORCA is the only thing

15:51.478 --> 15:54.212
keeping
Emma and Madison alive.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.213
Mark, we know you're hurting.

15:56.215 --> 15:59.752
But if we find the ORCA,
we'll find your family.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.755
I promise.

16:11.998 --> 16:13.297
<i>When was the last time</i>

16:13.299 --> 16:14.501
<i>you spoke to Emma?</i>

16:15.401 --> 16:17.070
About three years ago.

16:18.137 --> 16:19.602
After San Francisco,

16:19.604 --> 16:21.608
we went back home to Boston.

16:23.709 --> 16:26.242
Tried to put
the pieces back together.

16:26.244 --> 16:30.481
Emma dealt with it by doubling
down on saving the world

16:30.483 --> 16:32.385
and I started drinking.

16:34.119 --> 16:36.587
I can't tell you
how much I hated myself

16:36.589 --> 16:38.958
for letting Maddie see me
that way.

16:41.393 --> 16:42.860
Uh, you mind
if we cut in here?

16:42.862 --> 16:46.065
It's just,
you're gonna wanna see this.

16:47.499 --> 16:49.632
Emma combined the bioacoustics

16:49.634 --> 16:52.870
of different Titans
to create the ORCA's signal.

16:52.872 --> 16:54.704
A sort of baseline frequency

16:54.706 --> 16:56.774
that all the creatures
respond to.

16:56.776 --> 16:58.742
Attracting them,
repelling them,

16:58.744 --> 17:01.711
even at times
calming them down.

17:01.713 --> 17:03.714
It's pretty remarkable
actually.

17:03.716 --> 17:04.814
The problem is
we don't know

17:04.816 --> 17:06.249
which Titans she combined.

17:06.251 --> 17:08.785
But if you can identify
those frequencies,

17:08.787 --> 17:11.255
we'll be able
to track the ORCA

17:11.257 --> 17:13.523
and find Emma and Madison.

17:13.526 --> 17:15.592
Jesus!

17:15.594 --> 17:17.527
How many of these things
are there?

17:17.529 --> 17:20.864
<i>Seventeen and counting
after Gojira.</i>

17:20.866 --> 17:22.198
Seventeen?

17:22.200 --> 17:23.800
Most of them were discovered
in deep hibernation.

17:23.801 --> 17:26.069
While others we've contained

17:26.071 --> 17:27.671
at top secret sites
around the globe.

17:27.673 --> 17:30.640
Cambodia, Mexico,
Skull Island.

17:30.642 --> 17:33.076
We even found one in Wyoming.

17:33.078 --> 17:34.344
They're everywhere.

17:34.346 --> 17:35.579
Why don't you kill 'em?

17:35.581 --> 17:37.313
The government wants to.

17:37.315 --> 17:41.887
But Emma and I believe
some are benevolent.

17:44.323 --> 17:45.859
Don't kid yourself.

17:48.527 --> 17:50.896
Uh... Hey, look at that.
We're here.

18:01.473 --> 18:03.005
<i>Castle Bravo,</i>

18:03.007 --> 18:04.943
<i>this is Raptor One.
On direct approach.</i>

18:10.748 --> 18:12.649
<i>Raptor One,
you are cleared</i>

18:12.651 --> 18:14.953
<i>for assisted descent
to pad four.</i>

18:23.961 --> 18:25.763
<i>Sensors set
for three meters.</i>

18:25.765 --> 18:27.167
<i>Beginning sub-surface descent.</i>

18:30.201 --> 18:32.602
This is new.

18:32.604 --> 18:34.604
Yeah, we call it Castle Bravo.

18:34.606 --> 18:36.439
Our new flagship facility

18:36.441 --> 18:39.810
built to track and study
Godzilla on his own turf.

18:39.812 --> 18:41.644
I thought he was missing.

18:41.646 --> 18:44.183
Well, only if you don't know
where to look.

18:54.226 --> 18:57.561
As you know,
at approximately 0700 hours,

18:57.563 --> 18:59.697
our containment site

18:59.699 --> 19:01.698
in China's Yunnan Rainforest
was raided.

19:01.700 --> 19:05.136
The specimen,
code name Mothra, escaped.

19:05.138 --> 19:09.505
Only to cocoon itself later
under a nearby waterfall.

19:09.507 --> 19:10.908
While Doctor Emma Russell

19:10.910 --> 19:13.076
and her daughter Madison
were taken hostage.

19:13.078 --> 19:17.113
This is the man responsible,
Alan Jonah.

19:17.115 --> 19:20.251
A former British army colonel
turned ecoterrorist.

19:20.253 --> 19:23.419
Obsessed with restoring
natural order.

19:23.421 --> 19:24.988
And to fund his operations,

19:24.990 --> 19:28.225
he began trafficking
in a new and dangerous market.

19:28.227 --> 19:29.993
Titan DNA.

19:29.995 --> 19:31.961
What the hell is someone gonna
do with a giant worm?

19:31.963 --> 19:33.563
Are you kidding,
Martinez?

19:33.565 --> 19:35.032
What can't you do with it?

19:35.034 --> 19:37.101
Pharmaceuticals,
bioweapons, food...

19:37.103 --> 19:40.204
Hell, there isn't a country
or a company on the planet

19:40.206 --> 19:42.104
that doesn't wanna get its
hands on one of these suckers.

19:42.106 --> 19:45.342
And remember,
this is just a larva.

19:45.344 --> 19:46.576
That's a baby.

19:46.578 --> 19:48.611
After it cocoons,

19:48.613 --> 19:50.013
something else
is gonna crawl out.

19:50.015 --> 19:52.783
Something bigger, meaner...

19:52.785 --> 19:54.485
- We don't know that, Rick.
- Oh, yeah?

19:54.487 --> 19:56.521
Just wait for it, Chen.

19:56.523 --> 19:58.956
Our intel indicates
that Jonah wants

19:58.958 --> 20:00.390
to capture this specimen.

20:00.392 --> 20:01.958
Alive.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.128
Which means that he and his
mercs won't be far behind.

20:04.130 --> 20:07.496
At 0500, we'll ship out
to launch a joint operation...

20:07.498 --> 20:09.033
I wouldn't bother.

20:09.035 --> 20:10.167
Excuse me?

20:10.169 --> 20:11.869
Sounds like
a duck hunt to me.

20:11.871 --> 20:13.402
Uh, Mark, why don't we let
Colonel Foster finish...

20:13.404 --> 20:15.939
A decoy. A diversion.

20:15.941 --> 20:17.707
Look, they've already got Emma
and the ORCA.

20:17.709 --> 20:20.076
Why would they want just this
one when they've got the keys

20:20.078 --> 20:23.613
to your entire magic kingdom
of horrors back here?

20:23.615 --> 20:26.283
I think that they want you
to go after this Mothra

20:26.285 --> 20:28.518
so they can go
after a real prize.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.353
Something bigger.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.054
Right.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.191
Mark,

20:34.324 --> 20:35.692
this is not the first specimen
they've captured.

20:35.694 --> 20:36.927
They know what they are doing.

20:36.929 --> 20:38.361
That's not
just a specimen.

20:38.363 --> 20:39.996
I've got an ex-wife
and a daughter out there,

20:39.998 --> 20:41.331
in case you forgot.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.734
No. No one has
forgotten that, Mark,

20:43.736 --> 20:44.935
but, uh, to remind you,

20:44.937 --> 20:46.369
you were brought on here

20:46.371 --> 20:48.004
to help track the ORCA,
and to advise us...

20:48.006 --> 20:51.408
I advise you to kill
these things. All of 'em.

20:51.410 --> 20:53.044
Especially him.

20:53.046 --> 20:54.312
You wanna make sure
these things

20:54.314 --> 20:55.880
don't fall
into the wrong hands?

20:55.882 --> 20:57.714
You kill them
and the ORCA's useless.

20:57.716 --> 21:00.383
Emma wouldn't have
wanted that.

21:00.385 --> 21:01.819
Even to save her life.

21:01.821 --> 21:03.152
Well, it wouldn't be
the first time

21:03.154 --> 21:05.288
Emma put all of this
before herself

21:05.290 --> 21:07.359
or her family, would it?

21:12.331 --> 21:14.364
Dude hates Titans.

21:14.366 --> 21:16.702
Yeah, well, you would too,
if you were him.

21:22.107 --> 21:24.207
<i>Outpost 32,
this is Raptor Five,</i>

21:24.209 --> 21:26.142
<i>on approach with
reinforcements and supplies.</i>

21:26.144 --> 21:27.812
<i>Requesting permission to land.</i>

21:27.814 --> 21:30.246
<i>Serizawa has all sites
on high alert,</i>

21:30.248 --> 21:32.649
<i>so transmitting
emergency codes now.</i>

21:32.651 --> 21:34.950
<i>Copy that, Raptor Five.</i>

21:34.952 --> 21:37.123
<i>Codes are good.
Nice to have you back.</i>

21:44.229 --> 21:45.230
Go.

21:51.836 --> 21:53.204
It's good to see ya.

21:53.206 --> 21:55.141
- Need a hand with offload?
- No, we're good!

21:58.911 --> 22:00.509
We're gonna put it
over at bay five.

22:00.511 --> 22:03.080
- Follow me!
- Go back up! Hey, hey!

22:03.082 --> 22:05.251
Leave them, let's go!

22:12.958 --> 22:14.490
I'm scared.

22:14.492 --> 22:16.228
I know. Me, too.

22:20.665 --> 22:22.599
Okay.

22:22.601 --> 22:25.002
Let's go.

22:34.513 --> 22:35.948
Eyes straight ahead.

22:37.382 --> 22:38.815
Deep breaths.

22:38.817 --> 22:40.353
Just like we talked about.

23:07.212 --> 23:08.714
Hmm.

23:20.692 --> 23:23.026
Mother of God.

23:23.028 --> 23:25.731
She had nothing to do
with this.

23:34.306 --> 23:36.041
Monster Zero.

23:58.896 --> 24:00.531
Any survivors?

24:00.533 --> 24:02.998
No. They tried to
launch an emergency beacon,

24:03.000 --> 24:04.501
but we cut them off in time.

24:04.503 --> 24:06.102
They'll figure it out.

24:06.104 --> 24:08.037
Fire up the drills.

24:09.440 --> 24:11.076
Do you have
everything you need?

24:12.276 --> 24:13.643
Good.

24:13.645 --> 24:15.313
Well, let's get started.

24:15.980 --> 24:17.249
Further.

24:41.239 --> 24:45.108
<i>We have a grizzly situation
up here in the attic.</i>

24:45.110 --> 24:46.509
<i>Come on, Andrew.
Andrew.</i>

24:46.511 --> 24:48.111
<i>I've come to eat
your horses.</i>

24:48.113 --> 24:49.611
<i>No, you can't eat
my horses...</i>

24:49.613 --> 24:50.917
<i>That's not...</i>

24:51.482 --> 24:52.515
<i>Stop.</i>

24:52.517 --> 24:53.717
<i>Look.</i>

24:53.719 --> 24:55.752
<i>- An intruder! Get her!
- Get her!</i>

24:55.754 --> 24:58.088
<i>- Get her! Get her!
- No, don't get me!</i>

24:58.090 --> 25:00.223
<i>Andrew, Madison!
Get her!</i>

25:00.225 --> 25:02.159
<i>- Get her!
- Bear kisses.</i>

25:04.696 --> 25:06.429
<i>Bear kisses!</i>

25:14.105 --> 25:18.774
<i>All personnel, report
to battle stations. Code red.</i>

25:18.776 --> 25:21.477
<i>All personnel,
report to battle stations.</i>

25:21.479 --> 25:23.613
<i>- Code red.
- At least 60 knots.</i>

25:23.615 --> 25:25.148
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

25:25.150 --> 25:27.082
<i>All personnel,
report to battle stations.</i>

25:27.084 --> 25:28.921
<i>Code red.</i>

25:31.524 --> 25:32.755
What's happening?

25:32.757 --> 25:34.056
Something's wrong.

25:34.058 --> 25:35.958
He's never been
this close before.

25:35.960 --> 25:37.928
- Who's he?
- Who do you think?

25:39.698 --> 25:42.399
He's taking out
our observation drones.

25:42.401 --> 25:43.566
Trajectory?

25:43.568 --> 25:46.703
Straight at us!
1,200 meters and closing.

25:46.705 --> 25:49.038
G-Team. Barnes,
Martinez, Hendricks,

25:49.040 --> 25:50.440
I want you on those CROWS now!

25:50.442 --> 25:52.644
You heard boss lady!
Let's move!

26:02.587 --> 26:05.088
Doctor Stanton.
Do you have his bioacoustics?

26:05.090 --> 26:06.790
Acoustics coming up!

26:08.192 --> 26:10.393
Okay, he's closing.
We're at 800 meters!

26:10.395 --> 26:12.028
Its movements are erratic.

26:12.030 --> 26:13.596
Heart and breathing elevated.

26:13.598 --> 26:16.065
Yeah, he's definitely
not happy about something.

26:16.067 --> 26:17.566
How are they getting all this?

26:17.568 --> 26:20.171
Emma isolated
Godzilla's bioacoustics.

26:21.039 --> 26:23.006
It allows us to track him.

26:23.008 --> 26:24.640
Even to get his vitals.

26:28.413 --> 26:30.813
Circling now,
closing in, 200 meters.

26:30.815 --> 26:32.248
Colonel!

26:32.250 --> 26:34.016
All teams in position,
weapons hot,

26:34.018 --> 26:35.453
ready to engage on my command.

26:37.722 --> 26:39.124
Come on, come on, come on.

26:39.790 --> 26:41.123
Hold your fire.

26:41.125 --> 26:42.726
We don't know he'll attack.

26:42.728 --> 26:45.329
He will if you keep
those guns on him.

26:45.331 --> 26:47.063
Now I want him dead
more than anybody,

26:47.065 --> 26:49.364
but unless this is a fight
that you know that you can win,

26:49.366 --> 26:50.603
for God's sake, stand down.

26:57.976 --> 26:59.409
Stand down.

26:59.411 --> 27:00.909
You can't be serious.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.280
I am.

27:03.081 --> 27:04.717
Stand down.

27:06.818 --> 27:08.083
Stand down.

27:08.085 --> 27:09.285
I say again,
safe your weapons.

27:09.287 --> 27:10.588
Do not engage.

27:15.161 --> 27:16.362
Listen.

27:18.096 --> 27:21.032
His heart rate, it's slowing.

27:28.007 --> 27:30.640
Open the shields.

27:30.642 --> 27:32.575
Oh, yeah, sure.
Let's bring him in for a beer.

27:32.577 --> 27:35.211
You out of your goddamn mind?

27:35.213 --> 27:37.082
Let him know
we're not a threat.

27:38.249 --> 27:39.986
Open the shields.

27:45.556 --> 27:46.558
Do it.

28:21.125 --> 28:23.427
Hey, what's with
the light show?

28:23.429 --> 28:26.496
It's an intimidation display.

28:26.498 --> 28:29.131
Like a gorilla
pounding his chest.

28:29.133 --> 28:31.167
Consider us very

28:31.169 --> 28:32.705
intimidated.

28:34.373 --> 28:36.575
I don't think it's for us.

28:45.217 --> 28:46.752
What are you doing, dude?

29:14.779 --> 29:16.281
Well,
that was interesting.

29:17.548 --> 29:18.550
Jesus!

29:28.326 --> 29:30.496
Can we maybe
close the shield now?

29:31.630 --> 29:34.229
Show me
his territorial routes.

29:34.231 --> 29:35.765
What? Why?

29:35.767 --> 29:37.667
Because I wanna start
a boat tour. Just show me.

29:37.669 --> 29:39.835
Okay. Coming up.

29:39.837 --> 29:41.871
You care to tell us
what you're looking for?

29:41.873 --> 29:43.806
When an animal leaves
its hunting ground,

29:43.808 --> 29:45.842
it's usually because
it's threatened by something.

29:45.844 --> 29:47.311
Run a course projection.

29:47.313 --> 29:48.811
We gotta go after him.

29:48.813 --> 29:50.882
He's looking for something
out there.

29:51.850 --> 29:53.285
It could be the ORCA.

29:55.853 --> 29:58.588
Doctor Stanton,
what's your projection?

29:58.590 --> 30:01.660
All paths have him
landing in the same place.

30:03.394 --> 30:04.660
Antarctica.

30:04.662 --> 30:06.028
Good, then.

30:06.030 --> 30:08.767
I mean, let's go!
Let's go find him. Let's...

30:10.101 --> 30:13.069
Wait, what's in Antarctica?

30:13.071 --> 30:14.169
Barnes,

30:14.171 --> 30:16.371
<i>contact the Argo.</i>

30:16.373 --> 30:17.610
Yes, ma'am.

30:28.853 --> 30:30.920
<i>The specimen at this site</i>

30:30.922 --> 30:32.822
has been kept
entirely off-book.

30:32.824 --> 30:35.124
And since it's
a more recent discovery,

30:35.126 --> 30:37.393
our data is limited.

30:37.395 --> 30:40.129
But it seems to be
another apex predator.

30:40.131 --> 30:42.698
Emma called it Monster Zero.

30:42.700 --> 30:45.067
It may have been
a rival alpha to Godzilla.

30:45.069 --> 30:47.903
Battling for dominance
over the other Titans.

30:47.905 --> 30:49.372
Doctor Chen?

30:49.374 --> 30:51.940
I've been scouring through
thousands of years

30:51.942 --> 30:53.476
of myths and legends.

30:53.478 --> 30:56.079
But it's almost as if
people were scared

30:56.081 --> 30:57.647
to even write about it.

30:57.649 --> 31:00.248
As if it was meant
to be forgotten.

31:00.250 --> 31:01.450
Sorry, I hate to crash
a party,

31:01.452 --> 31:02.718
but I got some bad news.

31:02.720 --> 31:04.353
You could just say news.
It's always bad.

31:04.355 --> 31:05.755
We lost Godzilla.

31:05.757 --> 31:07.790
He dropped off the scan
near Venezuela.

31:07.792 --> 31:08.891
Dropped off?

31:08.893 --> 31:10.226
I'm telling you,
Doctor Brooks was right.

31:10.228 --> 31:11.527
It's a Hollow Earth.

31:11.529 --> 31:13.429
That's how he moves around
so fast

31:13.431 --> 31:16.600
using these underwater tunnels
like wormholes.

31:16.602 --> 31:18.534
Just zippin' around.

31:18.536 --> 31:20.136
Everyone look sharp.

31:20.138 --> 31:21.974
We're approaching the base.

31:31.882 --> 31:34.784
- They're here.
- Keep 'em busy.

31:34.786 --> 31:36.852
Launch reaction force.
Move out!

31:36.854 --> 31:38.891
All right, gents!
Got the green light!

31:59.844 --> 32:01.111
If Jonah is looking

32:01.113 --> 32:02.445
to extract genetic samples

32:02.447 --> 32:05.282
they'll be here
in the bio labs.

32:05.284 --> 32:06.783
All right, two minutes!

32:06.785 --> 32:08.786
Check your equipment,
stand by the door.

32:27.238 --> 32:29.507
Come on, Ash.
Make it snappy.

32:31.343 --> 32:33.309
- Detonator ready.
- Let's go.

32:33.311 --> 32:34.643
Come on, Maddie.

32:34.645 --> 32:35.847
Move! Move!

32:53.965 --> 32:56.735
Remember, eyes wide.
We got friendlies in here.

32:58.937 --> 33:00.703
<i>Move to tunnel two.</i>

33:00.705 --> 33:02.371
<i>Stay on overwatch.</i>

33:02.373 --> 33:03.741
<i>Roger that, Chief.</i>

33:21.794 --> 33:23.493
<i>Ambush! Ambush!</i>

33:27.731 --> 33:29.832
Team under fire! 360 ambush!

33:29.834 --> 33:31.603
<i>We're taking heavy losses.</i>

33:32.269 --> 33:33.504
Break right!

33:35.774 --> 33:37.073
<i>Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!</i>

33:37.075 --> 33:38.140
<i>We got friendlies!</i>

33:38.142 --> 33:39.344
<i>No!</i>

33:40.178 --> 33:41.380
Mark?

33:43.213 --> 33:45.214
Get down there and help
Barnes. I'm going after him.

33:45.216 --> 33:46.418
Roger that.

33:59.565 --> 34:03.501
Hey, guys.
I'm getting an EKG reading.

34:08.306 --> 34:10.239
Emma?

34:10.241 --> 34:11.774
Maddie!

34:11.775 --> 34:13.411
Number one, let's go.

34:19.750 --> 34:21.417
Barnes, this is Foster.

34:21.418 --> 34:25.391
I've got eyes on the target.
Repeat, eyes on the target.

34:30.962 --> 34:32.097
Let 'em go!

34:34.697 --> 34:36.634
- Ash!
- Dad!

34:38.536 --> 34:41.337
- Mark.
- Emma, Madison, let's go.

34:41.339 --> 34:42.538
Dad.

34:42.540 --> 34:43.906
Let's go.

34:43.908 --> 34:45.074
- Emma, Maddie, come on.
- Daddy?

34:45.076 --> 34:46.710
Madison, walk to me.

34:46.712 --> 34:49.344
Walk to me now.
Come on, honey.

34:49.346 --> 34:51.279
Barnes, I've got two hostages,
one target down.

34:51.281 --> 34:53.415
<i>- Now! Come on, Maddie.
- I do not have a shot.</i>

34:53.417 --> 34:54.817
<i>Repeat, I do not have a shot.</i>

34:54.819 --> 34:56.518
Emma, what are you doing?
Let's go. Come on!

34:56.520 --> 34:58.022
- Dad.
- Maddie.

34:59.223 --> 35:00.426
Dad.

35:03.227 --> 35:04.595
Madison.

35:30.689 --> 35:32.223
What the hell?

35:40.598 --> 35:41.967
I'm sorry.

35:44.502 --> 35:46.069
Run.

36:00.785 --> 36:01.986
Maddie!

36:03.422 --> 36:04.623
Dad!

36:07.024 --> 36:08.026
Move, move!

36:24.341 --> 36:26.644
- Foster!
- Get out of the way!

36:27.812 --> 36:29.245
- Let's go!
- Hang on! Move!

36:29.247 --> 36:30.913
Hendricks, on the double!

36:30.915 --> 36:32.584
- I got you, Colonel!
- Get her legs!

36:34.484 --> 36:35.786
We gotta go!

36:41.326 --> 36:42.528
Damn it!

36:50.000 --> 36:52.301
Martinez, Foster, let's go!

36:52.303 --> 36:53.638
Move, move! Come on!

36:56.440 --> 36:58.743
Come on, let's go!
Strap in!

37:00.344 --> 37:02.645
No checklist this time.
Check clearance right.

37:02.647 --> 37:04.080
Clear right.

37:04.082 --> 37:05.781
- What is Dad doing here?
- I don't know, honey.

37:05.783 --> 37:07.752
Let's go.

37:09.988 --> 37:11.554
We can't leave him.

37:11.556 --> 37:12.788
What are you
waiting for?

37:12.790 --> 37:14.293
Wake it up.

37:28.672 --> 37:30.241
Let's go! Move it!

38:55.560 --> 38:57.728
You gotta be fucking kidding.

39:10.140 --> 39:12.208
Fall back! Fall back!

39:12.210 --> 39:15.213
Get to the chopper!

39:15.980 --> 39:17.149
Go, go, go!

39:27.658 --> 39:29.126
Open fire!

39:38.803 --> 39:41.870
We'll do an emergency
vertical take-off at max RPM.

39:41.872 --> 39:43.174
Number two's
still speeding up.

39:56.786 --> 39:58.388
Oh, shit.

40:22.145 --> 40:23.913
<i>This is Raptor One to Argo.</i>

40:23.915 --> 40:25.980
Requesting immediate
urgent extract.

40:25.982 --> 40:27.850
Again, I say urgent extract.

40:27.852 --> 40:29.053
Griffin, get us the hell
out of here!

40:31.756 --> 40:33.355
Madison!

40:33.357 --> 40:34.489
Madison, no!

40:43.902 --> 40:45.902
- You need to let go of it!
- No! No! No!

40:45.904 --> 40:47.804
- Madison!
- Maddie! Let go!

40:47.806 --> 40:49.307
No!

41:20.672 --> 41:22.904
<i>Argo, this is
Raptor One. We've been hit.</i>

41:22.906 --> 41:24.276
All systems are down.

41:26.877 --> 41:28.212
Look out!

42:48.725 --> 42:50.361
Everybody, hold on!

43:11.047 --> 43:12.250
Mark!

43:15.620 --> 43:18.185
Everybody,
clear out. Let's go!

43:18.187 --> 43:19.522
Go! Go!

43:19.524 --> 43:21.226
- Mark!
- I'm stuck.

43:39.210 --> 43:40.408
Are you all right?

43:40.410 --> 43:42.446
Got it!
I got it. Go, go!

45:33.156 --> 45:34.623
Anything on the satellites?

45:34.625 --> 45:36.525
Subs have Godzilla hauling ass
off Argentina.

45:36.527 --> 45:39.795
We lost Monster Zero in
a tropical storm over Brazil.

45:39.797 --> 45:41.964
Scanning the entire
Southern Hemisphere.

45:41.966 --> 45:43.199
So far, nothing.

45:43.201 --> 45:44.433
Then scan the Northern.

45:44.435 --> 45:45.667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:45.669 --> 45:47.268
I know what I saw, Sam.

45:47.270 --> 45:49.504
And I'm telling you,
she pulled that trigger.

45:49.506 --> 45:51.339
All due respect, Colonel,
you saw wrong.

45:51.341 --> 45:53.007
Okay? She wouldn't
have done it.

45:53.009 --> 45:55.411
Christ, she recruited pretty
much everyone in this room.

45:55.413 --> 45:57.545
Maybe Jonah forced her, right?

45:57.547 --> 45:59.482
Maybe he used Madison
as leverage.

45:59.484 --> 46:01.083
No, no. It had to be
someone else.

46:01.085 --> 46:02.287
Emma.

46:04.721 --> 46:06.390
It was Emma.

46:07.257 --> 46:09.824
Foster saw it right.

46:09.826 --> 46:11.694
It was her.
No one forced her to.

46:11.696 --> 46:12.864
Are you sure?

46:14.631 --> 46:16.799
First, she releases Mothra.

46:16.801 --> 46:18.500
And now Monster Zero.

46:18.502 --> 46:21.670
Anyone else sensing
a pattern here?

46:21.672 --> 46:23.371
Yes,
and not a good one.

46:23.373 --> 46:25.473
It's as if she is trying
to start a mass awakening.

46:25.475 --> 46:27.810
Well, it's just too bad
that no one tried

46:27.812 --> 46:29.478
to warn you that
that was gonna happen.

46:29.480 --> 46:30.946
Hang on, guys.

46:30.948 --> 46:33.149
Why the hell would she
want to release them?

46:33.151 --> 46:34.783
And why would she
team up with Jonah,

46:34.785 --> 46:36.786
of all people, to do it?

46:36.788 --> 46:37.886
We'll ask her

46:37.888 --> 46:39.790
when we find her.

46:40.924 --> 46:44.261
So, let's keep looking.

46:58.643 --> 47:00.475
<i>Godzilla
appears to be following</i>

47:00.477 --> 47:02.076
the same path
as Emma's osprey,

47:02.078 --> 47:04.846
heading north
over South America to here.

47:04.848 --> 47:07.583
Outpost 56 in Isla de Mara,
Mexico.

47:07.585 --> 47:09.752
We touch down there
in ten minutes.

47:09.754 --> 47:11.120
What about the people?

47:11.122 --> 47:12.654
I'm sorry?

47:12.656 --> 47:15.257
The people. The people
down there in that village

47:15.259 --> 47:16.893
that don't realize
they're gonna be

47:16.895 --> 47:18.261
the special of the day.

47:18.263 --> 47:20.161
We've sent G-Team
to begin an evacuation.

47:20.163 --> 47:21.462
Doctor Serizawa,

47:21.464 --> 47:23.031
we have a call
on the emergency channel

47:23.033 --> 47:24.132
from Isla de Mara.

47:24.134 --> 47:25.569
Answer it.

47:33.743 --> 47:35.210
<i>I suppose I should go first.</i>

47:35.212 --> 47:37.145
Where's Madison?

47:37.147 --> 47:39.448
<i>- She's right here with me.
- Dad, are you okay?</i>

47:39.450 --> 47:41.783
Madison, you all right, hon?

47:41.785 --> 47:42.786
<i>Dad...</i>

47:44.122 --> 47:46.254
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

47:46.256 --> 47:47.455
You don't need to be...

47:47.457 --> 47:48.824
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

47:48.826 --> 47:50.091
<i>I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

47:50.093 --> 47:51.692
She's fine, Mark, trust me.

47:51.694 --> 47:53.194
<i>Trust is a little hard</i>

47:53.196 --> 47:54.529
<i>to come by, Doctor Russell.</i>

47:54.531 --> 47:56.130
Especially after
what you pulled.

47:56.132 --> 47:57.600
<i>I know.</i>

47:57.602 --> 48:02.103
And I can only imagine
what you're all thinking.

48:02.105 --> 48:05.908
<i>But if there were any other
way to do this, I would.</i>

48:05.910 --> 48:07.545
Do what, Emma?

48:08.411 --> 48:10.045
<i>I'm saving the world.</i>

48:10.047 --> 48:12.714
But by releasing those things?
That doesn't make sense.

48:12.716 --> 48:16.150
<i>As impossible
as it seems, it does.</i>

48:16.152 --> 48:18.120
<i>Hear me out, Mark.</i>

48:18.122 --> 48:19.821
<i>After we lost Andrew,</i>

48:19.823 --> 48:22.757
<i>I swore his death
would not be in vain.</i>

48:22.759 --> 48:25.127
<i>That I would find an answer.</i>

48:25.129 --> 48:27.495
<i>A solution to why
the Titans were rising.</i>

48:27.497 --> 48:29.029
<i>But as I dug deeper,</i>

48:29.031 --> 48:33.301
<i>I realized that
they were here for a reason.</i>

48:33.303 --> 48:34.736
<i>And that despite all the years</i>

48:34.738 --> 48:38.107
<i>that we spent
trying to stop them,</i>

48:38.109 --> 48:40.475
<i>we never dared
to confront the truth.</i>

48:40.477 --> 48:42.310
Which truth?

48:42.312 --> 48:45.580
Humans have been the dominant
species for thousands of years

48:45.582 --> 48:47.181
and look what's happened.

48:47.183 --> 48:49.451
Overpopulation,

48:49.453 --> 48:52.687
<i>pollution, war.</i>

48:52.689 --> 48:57.192
<i>The mass extinction we feared
has already begun.</i>

48:57.194 --> 49:00.328
<i>And we are the cause.</i>

49:00.330 --> 49:03.031
<i>We are the infection.</i>

49:03.033 --> 49:05.100
<i>But like all living organisms,</i>

49:05.102 --> 49:08.504
<i>the earth unleashed a fever
to fight this infection.</i>

49:08.506 --> 49:12.540
<i>Its original
and rightful rulers,</i>

49:12.542 --> 49:14.208
<i>the Titans.</i>

49:14.210 --> 49:17.379
<i>They are part of the earth's
natural defense system.</i>

49:17.381 --> 49:21.650
<i>A way to protect the planet,
to maintain its balance.</i>

49:21.652 --> 49:25.788
<i>But if governments are allowed
to contain them, destroy them,</i>

49:25.790 --> 49:27.788
<i>or use them for war,</i>

49:27.790 --> 49:30.926
<i>the human infection will only
continue to spread.</i>

49:30.928 --> 49:36.998
<i>And within our lifetime,
our planet will perish,</i>

49:37.000 --> 49:38.699
<i>and so will we.</i>

49:38.701 --> 49:41.703
Unless we restore balance.

49:41.705 --> 49:44.239
<i>And what's gonna
be left, if you do this?</i>

49:44.241 --> 49:47.976
<i>A dead, charred world,
overrun by monsters?</i>

49:47.978 --> 49:49.344
No, Doctor Stanton,

49:49.346 --> 49:51.013
<i>the exact opposite.</i>

49:51.015 --> 49:53.915
<i>Just like how a forest fire
replenishes the soil</i>

49:53.917 --> 49:56.518
<i>or how a volcano
creates new land,</i>

49:56.520 --> 49:59.254
<i>we have seen signs that these
creatures will do the same.</i>

49:59.256 --> 50:03.091
<i>San Francisco, Las Vegas,
wherever the Titans go,</i>

50:03.093 --> 50:06.795
<i>life follows,
triggered by their radiation.</i>

50:06.797 --> 50:08.964
<i>They are the only thing
that can reverse</i>

50:08.966 --> 50:10.833
<i>the destruction
that we started.</i>

50:10.835 --> 50:14.969
<i>They are the only guarantee
that life will carry on.</i>

50:14.971 --> 50:18.205
<i>But for that to happen,
we must set them free.</i>

50:18.207 --> 50:19.975
You are murdering the world.

50:19.977 --> 50:21.210
<i>No.</i>

50:21.212 --> 50:23.310
<i>Because as difficult
as this will be,</i>

50:23.312 --> 50:26.214
<i>I promise
humanity will not go extinct.</i>

50:26.216 --> 50:30.819
<i>Using the ORCA, we will return
to a natural order.</i>

50:30.821 --> 50:33.355
<i>A forgotten order,
where we coexisted</i>

50:33.357 --> 50:35.123
<i>in balance with the Titans.</i>

50:35.125 --> 50:37.058
<i>The first gods.</i>

50:37.060 --> 50:39.694
This is a dangerous path.

50:39.696 --> 50:42.931
You are meddling with forces
beyond our comprehension.

50:42.933 --> 50:44.966
Gambling with
the lives of billions!

50:44.968 --> 50:47.301
<i>And what are you gambling
with, Serizawa?</i>

50:47.303 --> 50:49.004
<i>Monarch is broken.</i>

50:49.006 --> 50:50.973
<i>It's on the verge of being
shut down by a government</i>

50:50.975 --> 50:53.408
<i>whose only objective is to
eradicate the creatures.</i>

50:53.410 --> 50:56.444
<i>And if that happens,
what will our chances be?</i>

50:56.446 --> 50:58.212
You are out
of your goddamn mind!

50:58.214 --> 51:00.082
<i>First, you put
our daughter's life in danger,</i>

51:00.084 --> 51:01.815
<i>and now you get to
decide the fate of the world.</i>

51:01.817 --> 51:04.319
- That's rich, Emma!
- I couldn't be more sane,

51:04.321 --> 51:06.522
<i>and Madison
couldn't be stronger.</i>

51:06.524 --> 51:09.491
<i>After we lost Andrew,
I trained her to survive.</i>

51:09.493 --> 51:12.728
<i>And at least now, she will
have a fighting chance.</i>

51:12.730 --> 51:14.897
A fighting chance? Why don't
you listen to yourself?

51:14.899 --> 51:17.065
<i>It's not all math, Emma.</i>

51:17.067 --> 51:18.900
<i>Some things,
you can't control.</i>

51:18.902 --> 51:21.538
<i>And there are some things
that you can't run from.</i>

51:22.973 --> 51:25.410
This won't bring him
back to us.

51:39.790 --> 51:42.660
<i>I can only urge you all
to take refuge.</i>

51:43.660 --> 51:45.259
<i>Over the last 60 years,</i>

51:45.261 --> 51:47.929
<i>Monarch has prepared bunkers
around the world</i>

51:47.931 --> 51:50.565
<i>to save
and restart civilization.</i>

51:50.567 --> 51:52.536
<i>I suggest you find them.</i>

51:59.743 --> 52:01.076
That bitch.

52:01.078 --> 52:03.578
How long
until this thing lands?

52:03.580 --> 52:04.913
Three minutes.

52:04.915 --> 52:06.482
You might
want to rethink that.

52:06.484 --> 52:07.850
Why?

52:07.852 --> 52:09.750
Something's not right.
Check this out.

52:09.752 --> 52:12.053
Emma's not at Isla de Mara.

52:12.055 --> 52:14.723
I mean, the signal's too weak
to be local.

52:14.725 --> 52:16.491
She's bouncing it off
our satellites.

52:16.493 --> 52:18.893
They must be holed up
in one of our old bunkers.

52:18.895 --> 52:20.694
She could be anywhere.

52:20.696 --> 52:24.232
What is that?

52:24.234 --> 52:28.270
Oh, Jesus! She shut down
the containment system.

52:28.272 --> 52:29.607
How much time do we have?

52:30.906 --> 52:32.373
Containment system bypassed.
We're patched in.

52:32.375 --> 52:34.178
- Hmm.
- Ready to broadcast the ORCA.

52:36.413 --> 52:37.848
Doctor?

52:51.395 --> 52:52.995
Mom, don't!

52:52.997 --> 52:56.096
I'm sorry, did a child
just tell you what to do?

52:56.098 --> 52:57.833
Maybe Dad is right.
Maybe this isn't the way.

52:57.835 --> 52:59.533
By all means, Doctor Russell,

52:59.535 --> 53:01.101
let's reconsider
our entire plan.

53:01.103 --> 53:02.804
Especially after telling
your friends about it.

53:02.806 --> 53:04.640
Madison, we talked about this.

53:04.642 --> 53:06.107
No, you said you were
gonna help people,

53:06.109 --> 53:07.542
that you would let them
find shelter.

53:07.544 --> 53:10.879
We don't have time for this!

53:10.881 --> 53:12.815
Did you really think
this was gonna be easy?

53:12.817 --> 53:14.415
Painless?
Is that what you told her?

53:14.417 --> 53:15.917
Leave her out of this.

53:15.919 --> 53:17.585
Why? You're the one
who pulled her into it.

53:17.587 --> 53:21.623
Madison, tell me, what exactly
did Mommy sell you on?

53:21.625 --> 53:23.125
Some grand utopia?

53:23.127 --> 53:24.993
Man and monster,
living together

53:24.995 --> 53:26.527
in blissful harmony?

53:26.529 --> 53:28.830
Sir, they're
attempting to lock us out.

53:28.832 --> 53:30.232
It's now or never.

53:30.234 --> 53:34.904
Emma, you came to me.
This is your plan.

53:34.906 --> 53:36.839
We both want
to save the planet,

53:36.841 --> 53:38.073
but everything is going to die

53:38.075 --> 53:40.107
if we don't see it through.

53:40.109 --> 53:44.015
Please, at least let them
get to safety.

53:45.716 --> 53:48.886
Ma'am, our window's closing.

53:50.520 --> 53:52.023
Mom...

53:54.924 --> 53:56.690
I'm sorry, Madison.

53:56.692 --> 53:58.696
This is bigger
than just you and me.

54:24.221 --> 54:25.821
Tell them
to slow it down!

54:25.823 --> 54:27.325
Tell them to stand back!

54:35.364 --> 54:37.734
Move! Get out of the way!

55:02.058 --> 55:03.259
Clear, men!

55:41.864 --> 55:43.964
You got a catchy name
for this one?

55:43.966 --> 55:45.667
Local legends call it

55:45.669 --> 55:48.370
Rodan, the fire demon.

55:48.372 --> 55:50.605
That's comforting.

55:50.607 --> 55:51.973
Guys?

55:51.975 --> 55:53.741
You remember
that tropical storm

55:53.743 --> 55:55.009
where we lost Monster Zero?

55:55.011 --> 55:57.846
It's changing direction
and, uh,

55:57.848 --> 55:59.348
guess where it's headed now.

55:59.350 --> 56:01.382
That's not possible.

56:01.384 --> 56:03.217
No storm moves that fast.

56:03.219 --> 56:05.922
Unless
it's not a storm.

56:08.024 --> 56:09.623
- Oh, man!
- We need time

56:09.625 --> 56:10.893
to finish the evacuation.

56:10.895 --> 56:12.060
Well,
then you'd better hurry,

56:12.062 --> 56:13.261
'cause it's closing in fast.

56:13.263 --> 56:15.462
Serizawa,
it's not a coincidence

56:15.464 --> 56:17.466
that Monster Zero thing
is headed here.

56:17.468 --> 56:19.199
It's reacting
to Big Bird's cries.

56:19.201 --> 56:21.303
That means it's coming
for food, a fight, or a...

56:21.305 --> 56:23.705
Something more intimate.

56:23.707 --> 56:25.710
What do you suggest?

56:27.210 --> 56:28.710
<i>All fighters,</i>

56:28.712 --> 56:30.448
<i>weapons free.</i>

56:53.402 --> 56:55.036
Oh, I think
we got his attention.

56:55.038 --> 56:56.737
Everyone strap in.

56:56.739 --> 56:58.975
All ships, follow our lead.

57:33.910 --> 57:35.542
No!

57:36.779 --> 57:38.078
Please! Wait!

57:38.080 --> 57:39.848
It's gonna be okay!

57:39.850 --> 57:41.451
Hang on, kid!

57:57.835 --> 57:59.333
<i>Argo to Gold Squadron.</i>

57:59.335 --> 58:01.669
Let's lure this turkey
away from the mainland

58:01.671 --> 58:02.804
straight to Monster Zero.

58:02.806 --> 58:04.071
ETA two minutes!

58:04.073 --> 58:05.906
Gold Squadron,
engage on our six.

58:05.908 --> 58:07.510
<i>Copy. Start the clock.</i>

58:25.594 --> 58:27.864
<i>Bogey.
Nine o'clock high!</i>

58:35.004 --> 58:36.770
Duster 223.

58:36.772 --> 58:38.640
<i>Get out of there. He's on
your tail! Get out of there!</i>

58:47.250 --> 58:48.884
Cobra's Raptor
is off the team!

58:48.886 --> 58:51.355
ETA to Monster Zero,
60 seconds!

58:53.589 --> 58:54.823
<i>Raptor 37.</i>

58:54.825 --> 58:57.060
<i>Bogey coming up on your six.</i>

59:08.138 --> 59:09.270
<i>I'm losing control here.</i>

59:09.272 --> 59:10.538
<i>I'm losing control!</i>

59:15.978 --> 59:17.879
We lost the squadron!

59:17.881 --> 59:20.116
ETA to Monster Zero,
30 seconds!

59:37.767 --> 59:38.969
Ten seconds!

01:00:00.223 --> 01:00:02.625
Dive! Dive!

01:00:27.017 --> 01:00:28.783
Jesus,
they're killing each other.

01:00:28.785 --> 01:00:30.018
<i>Mayday, mayday!
This is Raptor One to Argo.</i>

01:00:30.020 --> 01:00:31.752
<i>Argo, do you read?</i>

01:00:31.754 --> 01:00:33.420
<i>Copy, Raptor
One. What's your status?</i>

01:00:33.422 --> 01:00:35.156
<i>We're screwed,
that's what.</i>

01:00:35.158 --> 01:00:36.558
And we got kids on board.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.292
We're gonna need
immediate mid-air retrieval.

01:00:38.294 --> 01:00:39.694
Lock on to their position,
and prepare the hangar

01:00:39.696 --> 01:00:41.328
for an emergency landing.

01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:42.562
Hangar doors are unresponsive.

01:00:42.564 --> 01:00:44.968
- Manual override?
- They're stuck!

01:00:46.535 --> 01:00:47.835
All right,
which way to the hangar?

01:00:47.837 --> 01:00:48.969
I can show you.

01:00:48.971 --> 01:00:50.605
Anybody else?

01:00:50.607 --> 01:00:53.174
I know the way.
I... Come on!

01:00:53.176 --> 01:00:54.611
Hope you got a big wrench.

01:01:03.953 --> 01:01:05.821
What's the problem?

01:01:05.823 --> 01:01:07.221
Hydraulics systems are jammed!

01:01:07.223 --> 01:01:08.989
I'm trying to
jump-start power.

01:01:08.991 --> 01:01:10.125
It's not looking good.

01:01:18.768 --> 01:01:21.104
It's Admiral Stenz.

01:01:21.937 --> 01:01:23.605
Admiral.

01:01:23.607 --> 01:01:25.440
<i>Doctor
Serizawa, Colonel Foster.</i>

01:01:25.442 --> 01:01:27.208
<i>I need you and your forces
to immediately disengage</i>

01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:28.975
<i>and withdraw
to a safe distance.</i>

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:31.112
Admiral, I don't understand.

01:01:31.114 --> 01:01:34.949
<i>We have been developing
a prototype for a new weapon.</i>

01:01:34.951 --> 01:01:36.650
<i>An oxygen destroyer.</i>

01:01:36.652 --> 01:01:39.855
<i>Designed to exterminate
all life forms</i>

01:01:39.857 --> 01:01:41.388
<i>within a two-mile radius.</i>

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:43.357
<i>With any luck,
it will kill these things</i>

01:01:43.359 --> 01:01:45.726
<i>and this nightmare
will finally be over.</i>

01:01:45.728 --> 01:01:47.527
<i>Admiral, we must
keep our faith in Gojira.</i>

01:01:47.529 --> 01:01:50.198
<i>I'm sorry, Doctor.
You had your chance.</i>

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:51.565
<i>The missile is
already on its way.</i>

01:01:51.567 --> 01:01:53.804
<i>May God have mercy on us all.</i>

01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:59.140
He's not lying.

01:01:59.142 --> 01:02:00.942
It's coming in hot.

01:02:00.944 --> 01:02:03.310
<i>Argo, you gotta get
those bay doors open now!</i>

01:02:03.312 --> 01:02:04.978
Have the crash
and fire crews ready.

01:02:11.488 --> 01:02:13.357
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

01:02:16.692 --> 01:02:19.062
Look out!

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:24.501
Hold on!

01:02:26.536 --> 01:02:28.569
Come on, Griff! Come on!

01:02:28.571 --> 01:02:32.076
Hit it! Hit it!

01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:49.623
That's what
I'm talking about, Griff!

01:02:49.625 --> 01:02:51.627
Everybody okay?

01:02:52.895 --> 01:02:54.661
Get over
to the back of the hangar.

01:02:54.663 --> 01:02:56.330
We're all gonna head this way.
This way. This way.

01:02:56.332 --> 01:02:58.165
Thanks for the lift!

01:03:00.169 --> 01:03:01.571
Go! Go!

01:03:03.806 --> 01:03:05.408
Oh, God!

01:03:30.334 --> 01:03:31.565
We're getting
out of here.

01:03:31.567 --> 01:03:33.167
The military
launched a weapon.

01:03:33.169 --> 01:03:34.368
It's gonna kill 'em both.

01:03:34.370 --> 01:03:36.270
Well, that's not
the worst idea.

01:03:44.013 --> 01:03:45.580
Ten,

01:03:45.582 --> 01:03:46.817
nine,

01:03:48.017 --> 01:03:49.583
eight,

01:03:49.585 --> 01:03:51.254
seven...

01:04:02.230 --> 01:04:05.636
...three, two...

01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.846
Jesus.

01:04:51.848 --> 01:04:55.149
<i>Doctor Stanton,
can you locate Gojira?</i>

01:04:57.120 --> 01:04:59.922
Yeah. I got something.

01:05:01.658 --> 01:05:06.763
His vitals are fading.
Radiation levels plummeting.

01:05:08.431 --> 01:05:10.701
Come on, big guy. Fight it.

01:05:20.977 --> 01:05:22.379
He's gone.

01:05:25.747 --> 01:05:28.718
Looks like you got
your wish, Mark.

01:06:53.069 --> 01:06:56.103
I thought we were going
to release them gradually.

01:06:56.105 --> 01:06:58.542
One at a time.

01:06:59.475 --> 01:07:01.944
I'm not the one doing this.

01:07:07.616 --> 01:07:09.652
Long live the king.

01:07:21.196 --> 01:07:23.065
You're a monster.

01:07:34.877 --> 01:07:36.611
<i>Castle Bravo, this is</i>

01:07:36.613 --> 01:07:38.612
<i>Containment Team Mosura.
Do you read? Over.</i>

01:07:38.614 --> 01:07:40.147
Castle Bravo,
this is Containment Team.

01:07:40.149 --> 01:07:41.214
Anything?

01:07:41.216 --> 01:07:42.583
Dr. Brooks.

01:07:42.585 --> 01:07:44.152
<i>We've lost contact
with the Argo,</i>

01:07:44.154 --> 01:07:46.154
Castle Bravo and the other
containment sites.

01:07:46.156 --> 01:07:49.457
Angkor Wat, Skull Island,
Stone Mountain.

01:07:49.459 --> 01:07:52.125
All the Titans,
they're escaping.

01:07:52.127 --> 01:07:54.663
<i>Repeat,
this may be our last comm.</i>

01:07:56.299 --> 01:07:58.031
Wait, wait, wait.

01:07:58.033 --> 01:07:59.600
It's... It's him.

01:07:59.602 --> 01:08:01.435
He's the one doing this.

01:08:01.437 --> 01:08:04.973
They're responding
to his call.

01:08:05.908 --> 01:08:08.178
Oh, God!
Where's Doctor Ling?

01:08:09.379 --> 01:08:10.980
She's outside.

01:08:12.381 --> 01:08:16.553
Doctor Ling! We've lost
contact with Monarch.

01:08:18.054 --> 01:08:19.656
Doctor Ling?

01:09:30.225 --> 01:09:32.227
- Madison, wait!
- Get away from me!

01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:33.926
Look, I know things
haven't gone

01:09:33.929 --> 01:09:36.395
exactly according to plan,
but I can fix this.

01:09:36.398 --> 01:09:37.731
According to plan?

01:09:37.733 --> 01:09:39.100
You said that you were
gonna be careful.

01:09:39.102 --> 01:09:40.466
That you'd release them
one at a time,

01:09:40.469 --> 01:09:41.701
that you would
restore balance!

01:09:41.703 --> 01:09:43.170
They were gonna
take over Monarch

01:09:43.171 --> 01:09:44.703
and kill the Titans.
I didn't have a choice.

01:09:44.706 --> 01:09:46.542
Bullshit!

01:09:49.845 --> 01:09:53.183
You said we were
doing this for Andrew.

01:09:57.653 --> 01:10:00.991
Do you really think
he would've wanted this?

01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:09.598
Exactly.

01:10:13.937 --> 01:10:15.205
Madison!

01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:19.209
Madison!

01:10:31.955 --> 01:10:33.590
Any luck?

01:10:34.357 --> 01:10:36.257
No.

01:10:36.259 --> 01:10:39.826
Whatever Emma used
to create the ORCA signal,

01:10:39.828 --> 01:10:41.427
I've never heard it.

01:10:41.429 --> 01:10:42.597
How are you doing?

01:10:44.399 --> 01:10:45.700
How's that?

01:10:45.702 --> 01:10:48.235
"Myth is our compass."

01:10:48.237 --> 01:10:50.337
It's something
my mom used to say.

01:10:50.339 --> 01:10:53.039
She believed our stories
about monsters and dragons

01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:56.142
could help us find the Titans

01:10:56.144 --> 01:10:58.012
and restore
our connection to nature.

01:10:58.014 --> 01:10:59.512
Wait, your mother?

01:10:59.514 --> 01:11:01.115
You're second-generation
Monarch?

01:11:01.117 --> 01:11:02.749
Third.

01:11:02.751 --> 01:11:05.018
It runs in the family.

01:11:05.020 --> 01:11:06.786
That's incredible.

01:11:06.788 --> 01:11:08.088
I don't suppose
your family has any tips

01:11:08.090 --> 01:11:09.457
on slaying dragons, do they?

01:11:09.459 --> 01:11:12.192
Slaying dragons
is a Western concept.

01:11:12.194 --> 01:11:14.194
In the East, they are sacred.

01:11:14.196 --> 01:11:18.134
Divine creatures who brought
wisdom, strength,

01:11:19.135 --> 01:11:20.737
even redemption.

01:11:23.538 --> 01:11:24.806
This oxygen destroyer,

01:11:24.808 --> 01:11:26.106
why wasn't
Monster Zero affected?

01:11:26.108 --> 01:11:27.408
I mean,
I'm no scientist,

01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:28.941
but I think
it has something to do

01:11:28.943 --> 01:11:30.276
with his goddamn head
growing back.

01:11:30.278 --> 01:11:32.045
Well, I've never seen
anything like it.

01:11:32.047 --> 01:11:34.548
It violates everything we know
about the natural order.

01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:37.450
Unless he's not
part of the natural order.

01:11:37.452 --> 01:11:38.753
What do you mean?

01:11:38.755 --> 01:11:42.390
I was able to
piece this together.

01:11:42.392 --> 01:11:45.292
Well, he looks
vaguely familiar.

01:11:45.294 --> 01:11:47.360
It tells
of a great dragon

01:11:47.362 --> 01:11:48.963
who fell from the stars.

01:11:48.965 --> 01:11:53.500
A Hydra whose storm swallowed
both men and gods alike.

01:11:53.502 --> 01:11:55.002
What, you mean an alien?

01:11:55.004 --> 01:11:57.605
Yes. He's not
part of our natural order.

01:11:57.607 --> 01:11:59.472
And he's not meant to be here.

01:11:59.474 --> 01:12:01.075
A false king.

01:12:01.077 --> 01:12:02.776
An invasive species.

01:12:02.778 --> 01:12:05.346
That could explain how he's
creating these massive storms

01:12:05.348 --> 01:12:08.048
and the effect he's having
on the other Titans.

01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:09.816
It's almost like
he's reshaping the planet

01:12:09.818 --> 01:12:11.185
to his own liking.

01:12:11.187 --> 01:12:12.820
These legends,
what did they call him?

01:12:12.822 --> 01:12:16.226
Ghidorah.
"The one who is many."

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:17.857
Ghi-what?

01:12:17.859 --> 01:12:19.060
She said, "Gonorrhea."

01:12:19.062 --> 01:12:20.527
- Huh?
- Ghidorah!

01:12:20.529 --> 01:12:23.263
Doctor Serizawa, we're
approaching Castle Bravo,

01:12:23.265 --> 01:12:25.798
but there's something
you should see.

01:12:30.239 --> 01:12:34.008
I'm guessing you weren't
expecting these guys.

01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:38.378
Moscow,
London, Washington, D.C.,

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:40.146
all under attack.

01:12:40.148 --> 01:12:42.383
On every continent,
the Titans are triggering

01:12:42.385 --> 01:12:45.352
earthquakes, wildfires,
tsunamis,

01:12:45.354 --> 01:12:48.922
and disasters we don't even
have names for yet.

01:12:48.924 --> 01:12:51.459
Now as before,
we have been trying to lure

01:12:51.461 --> 01:12:53.127
the creatures
with nuclear materials,

01:12:53.129 --> 01:12:55.797
but they are not
taking the bait this time.

01:12:55.799 --> 01:12:58.531
Their behavior
has become random.

01:12:58.533 --> 01:13:00.000
Erratic.

01:13:00.002 --> 01:13:02.468
And with our forces
spread desperately thin

01:13:02.470 --> 01:13:05.573
and these things
roaming the globe unimpeded,

01:13:05.575 --> 01:13:07.774
we are running out of options

01:13:07.776 --> 01:13:09.176
and time.

01:13:09.178 --> 01:13:11.712
Excuse me,
do you have something to add?

01:13:11.714 --> 01:13:13.847
Yeah. You're wrong.

01:13:13.849 --> 01:13:17.485
Their behavior
is not random or erratic.

01:13:17.487 --> 01:13:18.585
If I may, sir.

01:13:18.587 --> 01:13:21.088
As amazing as this sounds,

01:13:21.090 --> 01:13:23.323
they're moving like a pack.
They're hunting.

01:13:23.325 --> 01:13:27.061
All packs, from wolves
to killer whales,

01:13:27.063 --> 01:13:29.664
they all respond
directly to an alpha.

01:13:29.666 --> 01:13:31.332
And this Ghidorah
is the new alpha.

01:13:31.334 --> 01:13:33.866
And all the other creatures
are just doing his bidding.

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:36.303
They're an extension of him.

01:13:36.305 --> 01:13:39.839
We stop him, we stop them all.

01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:41.174
Is there another creature

01:13:41.176 --> 01:13:42.575
that might stand
a chance against him?

01:13:42.577 --> 01:13:44.311
No.

01:13:44.313 --> 01:13:48.149
<i>Ghidorah and Gojira's rivalry
was ancient and unique.</i>

01:13:48.151 --> 01:13:50.116
Right, so we killed
our best shot

01:13:50.118 --> 01:13:51.918
at beating this thing?

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:54.888
<i>Jonah, you don't get it.
This changes everything.</i>

01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:56.323
<i>With Godzilla gone,</i>

01:13:56.325 --> 01:13:57.490
<i>Monster Zero
isn't using the Titans</i>

01:13:57.492 --> 01:13:59.292
to restore the planet.

01:13:59.294 --> 01:14:02.029
He is using them
to destroy it.

01:14:02.031 --> 01:14:04.330
This isn't coexistence.
This is extinction.

01:14:04.332 --> 01:14:06.667
Listen, while you were
sitting comfortably

01:14:06.669 --> 01:14:07.935
in some laboratory,

01:14:07.937 --> 01:14:09.936
we've been fighting
for decades

01:14:09.938 --> 01:14:12.440
in one dirty war
after another.

01:14:12.442 --> 01:14:14.475
I've seen
human nature firsthand

01:14:14.477 --> 01:14:15.543
and I'm here to tell you

01:14:15.545 --> 01:14:16.677
that it doesn't
get any better.

01:14:16.679 --> 01:14:18.012
It just gets worse.

01:14:18.014 --> 01:14:20.414
So, I'm sorry
that Monster Zero

01:14:20.416 --> 01:14:23.350
isn't exactly
what we were expecting.

01:14:23.352 --> 01:14:29.058
But we opened Pandora's Box
and there's no closing it now.

01:14:30.992 --> 01:14:32.359
Maybe there is.

01:14:32.361 --> 01:14:34.093
Oh, don't be stupid.

01:14:34.095 --> 01:14:37.297
You broadcast again,
and you will expose us all.

01:14:37.299 --> 01:14:39.665
These creatures
communicate like whales, okay?

01:14:39.667 --> 01:14:42.201
<i>They can hear
sonar for thousands of miles,</i>

01:14:42.203 --> 01:14:44.471
<i>so let's send a team.</i>

01:14:44.473 --> 01:14:46.606
<i>Let's broadcast the ORCA
from Fenway.</i>

01:14:46.608 --> 01:14:48.308
<i>It's just a few miles
from here.</i>

01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:51.111
I could use the stadium
to amplify a signal

01:14:51.113 --> 01:14:52.812
that might stop these attacks.

01:14:52.814 --> 01:14:55.682
<i>The city's already being
evacuated, so it'll be safe.</i>

01:14:55.684 --> 01:14:57.284
<i>And then what?</i>

01:14:57.286 --> 01:14:58.852
<i>And then I'll figure out
what the hell</i>

01:14:58.854 --> 01:15:00.922
<i>Monster Zero really is
and try to stop it.</i>

01:15:00.924 --> 01:15:02.222
<i>Before Monarch finds us?</i>

01:15:02.224 --> 01:15:03.723
<i>I'm sure
all your friends will be</i>

01:15:03.725 --> 01:15:05.124
<i>very happy to see you again.</i>

01:15:05.126 --> 01:15:06.927
<i>We can't just sit here.</i>

01:15:06.929 --> 01:15:09.762
<i>All right? This isn't
the world that we wanted.</i>

01:15:09.764 --> 01:15:11.397
<i>I seem to remember
you telling me</i>

01:15:11.399 --> 01:15:14.267
<i>that the world
always belonged to them.</i>

01:15:14.269 --> 01:15:17.574
<i>Well, maybe it is time
we gave it back.</i>

01:15:20.408 --> 01:15:22.310
Mark!

01:15:22.312 --> 01:15:24.712
Mark, wait.
What are you doing?

01:15:24.714 --> 01:15:27.548
I can't just sit down there.
I gotta do something.

01:15:27.550 --> 01:15:28.883
Like what?

01:15:28.885 --> 01:15:30.817
- Like go find my daughter.
- How?

01:15:30.819 --> 01:15:32.221
Where are you gonna go?

01:15:33.989 --> 01:15:36.459
She's the only thing
I got left, Sam.

01:15:38.694 --> 01:15:40.060
I wasn't there for her.

01:15:40.062 --> 01:15:42.497
I'm not gonna
let that happen again.

01:15:44.399 --> 01:15:45.535
Good luck.

01:16:57.572 --> 01:16:59.075
Beautiful.

01:17:00.274 --> 01:17:01.408
Mothra.

01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:05.079
Queen of the Monsters.

01:17:05.081 --> 01:17:07.483
Are you recording this,
Stanton?

01:17:09.285 --> 01:17:12.552
I record everything now.

01:17:12.554 --> 01:17:14.257
Everything.

01:17:15.558 --> 01:17:18.057
It's like a song.

01:17:18.059 --> 01:17:19.793
I bet
there's only one thing

01:17:19.795 --> 01:17:21.497
that can understand this.

01:17:22.898 --> 01:17:24.334
Godzilla.

01:17:28.203 --> 01:17:30.337
Yeah, I got it.

01:17:30.339 --> 01:17:32.608
Picking up a reply.
Bringing it up.

01:17:38.046 --> 01:17:40.148
He's still alive.

01:17:42.318 --> 01:17:46.186
So, her and Godzilla,
they're like...

01:17:46.188 --> 01:17:47.553
They got a thing going on?

01:17:47.555 --> 01:17:49.490
That's kind of
messed up, right?

01:17:49.492 --> 01:17:52.225
Symbiotic relationships
between two different species

01:17:52.227 --> 01:17:55.160
aren't all that uncommon.

01:17:55.162 --> 01:17:56.696
Can you track him?

01:17:56.698 --> 01:17:59.669
No. Signal's too weak.

01:18:01.269 --> 01:18:02.739
But maybe she can.

01:18:06.942 --> 01:18:09.011
How many nukes do you have?

01:18:09.778 --> 01:18:11.710
Why?

01:18:11.712 --> 01:18:13.315
We could help him.

01:18:19.487 --> 01:18:21.521
This category
six hurricane over D.C.

01:18:21.523 --> 01:18:23.557
is where King Ghidorah
is nesting.

01:18:23.559 --> 01:18:25.625
Working with all four branches
of the military,

01:18:25.627 --> 01:18:27.227
this will be a joint operation

01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:29.628
to lure it away
from the mainland,

01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:32.298
<i>so that we can continue
evacuations long enough</i>

01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:35.037
<i>for our submersible team
to complete its mission.</i>

01:18:38.506 --> 01:18:42.508
So this plan is what you would
call a "long shot," right?

01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:44.244
What do those nerds
think they're gonna do

01:18:44.246 --> 01:18:45.945
down there
with a bunch of nukes?

01:18:45.947 --> 01:18:47.547
You ain't hear 'em, Griffin?

01:18:47.549 --> 01:18:50.086
They wanna bring Godzilla
back from the dead.

01:18:56.692 --> 01:18:59.093
<i>We'll be out of range
while you're down there,</i>

01:18:59.095 --> 01:19:00.660
<i>but a squadron
will stay behind</i>

01:19:00.662 --> 01:19:01.927
<i>to keep an eye out for you.</i>

01:19:01.929 --> 01:19:03.297
<i>Appreciate it.</i>

01:19:03.299 --> 01:19:04.597
<i>All righty, Bowman,</i>

01:19:04.599 --> 01:19:06.033
let's take her down.

01:19:06.035 --> 01:19:08.636
Dive the ship.
Make depth 150.

01:19:08.638 --> 01:19:09.902
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:19:09.904 --> 01:19:11.370
<i>Thanks, Sam.</i>

01:19:11.372 --> 01:19:12.642
<i>We'll need it.</i>

01:19:38.433 --> 01:19:40.336
What time is it?

01:19:42.871 --> 01:19:45.173
Time to get a new watch.

01:19:46.474 --> 01:19:49.642
Andrew's favorite joke.

01:19:49.644 --> 01:19:51.678
You never took that watch
out of your pocket

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.715
without him asking
that question.

01:19:57.251 --> 01:20:00.454
You told me five years ago,

01:20:00.456 --> 01:20:03.793
I'd be trying to save
the thing that took my son,

01:20:04.626 --> 01:20:05.892
that would be the only way

01:20:05.894 --> 01:20:07.194
to save the family
I have left...

01:20:07.196 --> 01:20:09.428
Sometimes,

01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:12.531
the only way to heal
our wounds is to make peace

01:20:12.533 --> 01:20:15.835
with the demons
who created them.

01:20:15.837 --> 01:20:17.370
You really believe that?

01:20:17.372 --> 01:20:18.907
Don't you?

01:20:19.974 --> 01:20:21.477
Isn't that why you are here?

01:20:24.746 --> 01:20:28.914
There are some things beyond
our understanding, Mark.

01:20:28.916 --> 01:20:32.820
We must accept them
and learn from them,

01:20:32.822 --> 01:20:34.788
because these moments
of crisis

01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:37.727
are also potential
moments of faith.

01:20:38.827 --> 01:20:40.060
A time

01:20:40.062 --> 01:20:43.565
when we either come together
or fall apart.

01:20:45.567 --> 01:20:48.871
Nature always has
a way of balancing itself.

01:20:50.304 --> 01:20:52.307
The only question is,

01:20:54.076 --> 01:20:57.313
what part will we play?

01:20:58.647 --> 01:21:00.713
Did you just make that up?

01:21:00.715 --> 01:21:01.714
No.

01:21:01.716 --> 01:21:04.519
I read it
in a fortune cookie once.

01:21:06.287 --> 01:21:08.456
A really long fortune cookie.

01:21:13.629 --> 01:21:14.962
Status of the ship?

01:21:14.964 --> 01:21:16.495
Some sort of vortex, Captain.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:18.733
It's dragging us.
1600 feet till impact.

01:21:23.171 --> 01:21:26.039
800 feet.

01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:27.473
Emergency blow! 200 feet!

01:21:27.475 --> 01:21:29.174
One hundred!

01:21:29.176 --> 01:21:30.878
Twenty-five!

01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:32.949
Brace for impact!

01:22:51.393 --> 01:22:53.560
<i>Argo, this is U.S.S. Brody</i>

01:22:53.562 --> 01:22:55.395
<i>en route
to evacuation perimeter.</i>

01:22:55.397 --> 01:22:59.402
<i>Weapons hot. Ready to engage
Titans on your command.</i>

01:23:00.836 --> 01:23:01.968
Jesus.

01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:04.637
It's like
the whole sky's alive.

01:23:06.241 --> 01:23:07.710
That's because it is.

01:23:10.377 --> 01:23:12.380
Here we go.

01:23:15.651 --> 01:23:17.016
Status report.

01:23:17.018 --> 01:23:18.819
Can't fix our position.
GPS is down.

01:23:18.821 --> 01:23:21.120
But inertial says we're...

01:23:21.122 --> 01:23:22.990
600 miles from departure.

01:23:22.992 --> 01:23:24.124
That can't be.

01:23:24.126 --> 01:23:25.624
I knew it, man!

01:23:25.626 --> 01:23:28.794
The vortex was a tunnel
into the Hollow Earth.

01:23:28.796 --> 01:23:31.030
It's a subterranean
tunnel system

01:23:31.032 --> 01:23:32.566
that connects
the entire planet.

01:23:32.568 --> 01:23:33.866
It doesn't matter.
I knew I was right.

01:23:33.868 --> 01:23:36.703
- I told you, Chen!
- Shut up, Rick.

01:23:36.705 --> 01:23:38.808
One second emergency
blow forward.

01:23:48.416 --> 01:23:50.350
Doctor?

01:23:50.352 --> 01:23:52.421
Launch probes.

01:24:05.533 --> 01:24:08.069
Range 1,000 meters.

01:24:09.203 --> 01:24:10.973
Camera good.

01:24:11.607 --> 01:24:13.973
Holding range.

01:24:13.975 --> 01:24:16.010
Steady.

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:21.080
Jesus.

01:24:21.082 --> 01:24:22.484
Pan right.

01:24:47.108 --> 01:24:48.540
Looks Egyptian.

01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:49.910
Or Roman.

01:24:49.912 --> 01:24:51.511
No, this is
something different.

01:24:51.513 --> 01:24:54.082
This is... This is way older.

01:25:03.992 --> 01:25:05.460
Oh, my.

01:25:15.037 --> 01:25:17.637
All of the legends,

01:25:17.639 --> 01:25:19.705
the stories,

01:25:19.707 --> 01:25:20.941
they are true.

01:25:20.943 --> 01:25:23.110
They really were
the first gods.

01:25:23.112 --> 01:25:25.044
If only the earth
and stones could speak,

01:25:25.046 --> 01:25:27.379
the stories
they could tell us.

01:25:27.381 --> 01:25:28.848
Doctor Stanton,

01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:30.450
<i>any sign of Gojira?</i>

01:25:30.452 --> 01:25:34.387
Yeah, the probe is
picking up a radioactive blob,

01:25:34.389 --> 01:25:36.459
just past that ridge.

01:25:37.259 --> 01:25:39.758
Set a course.

01:25:46.201 --> 01:25:48.066
<i>Attention, please.</i>

01:25:48.068 --> 01:25:50.303
<i>Martial law
has now been instated</i>

01:25:50.305 --> 01:25:51.838
<i>by order of the President.</i>

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:53.405
<i>The greater Boston area</i>

01:25:53.407 --> 01:25:55.741
<i>is now under control
of the U.S. Military.</i>

01:25:55.743 --> 01:25:58.978
<i>All citizens to report to
the nearest evacuation center</i>

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:00.847
<i>for immediate transport.</i>

01:26:00.849 --> 01:26:03.216
<i>I repeat, all citizens</i>

01:26:03.218 --> 01:26:05.084
<i>are to report
to the nearest evacuation...</i>

01:26:05.086 --> 01:26:06.919
<i>Massive
storms and other disasters</i>

01:26:06.921 --> 01:26:08.487
<i>triggered by the Titans</i>

01:26:08.489 --> 01:26:10.390
<i>have forced millions
to flee major cities.</i>

01:26:10.392 --> 01:26:13.927
<i>And with D.C. hit hard
by a category six hurricane</i>

01:26:13.929 --> 01:26:16.295
<i>that has left the capital
completely flooded,</i>

01:26:16.297 --> 01:26:20.299
<i>this is the single greatest
disaster in human history.</i>

01:26:20.301 --> 01:26:23.837
<i>The grim search continues,
as people around the world</i>

01:26:23.839 --> 01:26:25.405
<i>sift through the debris
of leveled homes</i>

01:26:25.407 --> 01:26:27.472
<i>in the hope of finding
missing loved ones.</i>

01:26:27.474 --> 01:26:29.342
<i>And though this sight
is heartbreaking,</i>

01:26:29.344 --> 01:26:31.677
<i>it is unfortunately
nothing unique.</i>

01:26:31.679 --> 01:26:33.879
<i>Cities around the globe
have fallen</i>

01:26:33.881 --> 01:26:35.582
<i>under the wake
of what many are calling</i>

01:26:35.584 --> 01:26:37.987
<i>"The Rise of the Titans."</i>

01:26:43.559 --> 01:26:45.491
I think we should stop.

01:26:45.493 --> 01:26:46.993
Why?

01:26:46.995 --> 01:26:48.994
'Cause I still wanna
have kids one day.

01:26:48.996 --> 01:26:51.763
Preferably without flippers.

01:26:51.765 --> 01:26:53.969
All stop. Hover the ship.

01:27:03.278 --> 01:27:04.613
Whoa.

01:27:05.546 --> 01:27:08.181
We got O2, CO2, and methane.

01:27:08.183 --> 01:27:10.886
It looks like there's some
sort of air pocket in there.

01:27:23.465 --> 01:27:24.664
My God.

01:27:24.666 --> 01:27:26.068
Zilla.

01:27:27.336 --> 01:27:29.735
- And goodnight, Gracie.
- Pull up the last frame.

01:27:29.737 --> 01:27:31.103
- Yup.
- There.

01:27:31.105 --> 01:27:32.871
The source of the radiation.

01:27:32.873 --> 01:27:34.740
That's why
he returned here.

01:27:34.742 --> 01:27:36.610
He's feeding,

01:27:36.612 --> 01:27:38.247
regenerating.

01:27:39.313 --> 01:27:41.282
This is his home.

01:27:42.384 --> 01:27:45.485
This is how
he's survived for so long.

01:27:45.487 --> 01:27:48.753
Always adapting, evolving.

01:27:48.755 --> 01:27:49.989
It's incredible.

01:27:49.991 --> 01:27:52.659
So,
dude's got this covered.

01:27:52.661 --> 01:27:54.427
Right?
He just needs a little nap.

01:27:54.429 --> 01:27:55.529
No.

01:27:55.531 --> 01:27:57.530
This process could take years.

01:27:57.532 --> 01:27:59.164
We have to proceed as planned.

01:27:59.166 --> 01:28:00.232
Hang on.

01:28:00.234 --> 01:28:02.668
We're gonna launch
a nuclear torpedo

01:28:02.670 --> 01:28:05.103
in order to revive
a giant monster.

01:28:05.105 --> 01:28:06.905
Okay, this is...
This is not like

01:28:06.907 --> 01:28:08.508
we're just jump-starting
a car.

01:28:08.510 --> 01:28:10.209
We have another complication.

01:28:10.211 --> 01:28:12.777
Our weapons systems were
damaged during the crash.

01:28:12.779 --> 01:28:13.847
We can't launch.

01:28:13.849 --> 01:28:15.714
Can it be repaired?

01:28:15.716 --> 01:28:17.417
I'm afraid not.

01:28:17.419 --> 01:28:20.986
Okay. What if
we go inside, set a timer,

01:28:20.988 --> 01:28:22.655
and blow up
the warhead manually?

01:28:22.657 --> 01:28:26.526
No way. If the heat doesn't
fry you, the radiation will.

01:28:30.032 --> 01:28:31.231
I'll go.

01:28:31.233 --> 01:28:32.832
What the hell does that mean?

01:28:32.834 --> 01:28:34.600
There must be another way.

01:28:34.602 --> 01:28:36.171
There's no time for debate.

01:28:37.572 --> 01:28:39.141
I'll go.

01:28:57.157 --> 01:28:59.026
<i>Argo, we are red on ammo</i>

01:28:59.028 --> 01:29:00.694
<i>and low on fuel. We can't
take much more of this!</i>

01:29:00.696 --> 01:29:03.696
Copy, copy. Just hold them off
as long as you can.

01:29:03.698 --> 01:29:04.797
Colonel,
take a look at this.

01:29:04.799 --> 01:29:05.899
All the Titans have stopped.

01:29:10.971 --> 01:29:13.405
What the hell
has gotten into them now?

01:29:19.647 --> 01:29:21.847
<i>It does
appear as if the attacks</i>

01:29:21.849 --> 01:29:23.517
<i>have ceased
for the time being,</i>

01:29:23.519 --> 01:29:26.518
<i>with the creatures going
from destructive to docile</i>

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:27.920
<i>within minutes.</i>

01:29:27.922 --> 01:29:30.021
<i>Now, no one is sure
how or why,</i>

01:29:30.023 --> 01:29:32.592
<i>but this seems to be
happening simultaneously</i>

01:29:32.594 --> 01:29:34.459
<i>around the world.</i>

01:29:36.363 --> 01:29:38.231
What's going on?

01:29:38.233 --> 01:29:39.768
The ORCA.

01:29:40.367 --> 01:29:42.234
What?

01:29:42.236 --> 01:29:45.006
I wonder
who could have done this.

01:29:49.443 --> 01:29:51.212
Maddie?

01:29:58.886 --> 01:30:00.755
Maddie.

01:30:04.593 --> 01:30:06.759
First contact,
you're gonna start

01:30:06.761 --> 01:30:08.695
losing your long-range vision.

01:30:08.697 --> 01:30:09.995
When you surface,

01:30:09.997 --> 01:30:11.396
your motor skills
are gonna start to fade,

01:30:11.398 --> 01:30:13.600
but I put a helioxed mixture
in the tank,

01:30:13.602 --> 01:30:17.439
which should help you
stay stable a little longer.

01:30:18.907 --> 01:30:21.477
It was an honor, man.

01:30:35.756 --> 01:30:37.492
Thank you.

01:30:41.929 --> 01:30:43.798
My notes.

01:30:46.367 --> 01:30:48.035
Are you sure?

01:30:49.705 --> 01:30:52.438
He fought for us, died for us.

01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:56.545
He's not only proof
that coexistence is possible,

01:30:58.013 --> 01:31:01.315
he is the key to it.

01:31:04.085 --> 01:31:07.189
Take care of them, Mark.

01:32:09.651 --> 01:32:12.584
Bowman, take us out, fast.

01:32:12.586 --> 01:32:14.223
Aye, Captain.

01:32:16.590 --> 01:32:18.893
He's clear.

01:35:11.366 --> 01:35:12.998
You all right?

01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.302
<i>Bowman, send a distress
message to the Argo.</i>

01:35:16.304 --> 01:35:18.340
Aye, Captain.

01:35:35.756 --> 01:35:37.792
See anything?

01:36:44.992 --> 01:36:46.595
Nobody move!

01:37:23.497 --> 01:37:25.899
Are you okay?

01:37:25.901 --> 01:37:27.499
I know how to find 'em.

01:37:33.073 --> 01:37:36.408
I know how to find 'em!

01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:38.712
Let's make him proud
and not screw this up.

01:37:40.915 --> 01:37:42.048
How did he, uh...

01:37:42.050 --> 01:37:43.351
By saving us.

01:37:46.487 --> 01:37:47.853
Sam, what've we got going on?

01:37:47.855 --> 01:37:49.888
We think
Emma activated the ORCA

01:37:49.890 --> 01:37:50.957
somewhere near Boston.

01:37:50.959 --> 01:37:52.357
That's why Ghidorah
and Godzilla

01:37:52.359 --> 01:37:54.026
are both headed that way now.

01:37:54.028 --> 01:37:55.927
But we haven't been able to
pinpoint the exact location

01:37:55.929 --> 01:37:58.030
without the missing piece
of the ORCA signal.

01:37:58.032 --> 01:37:59.699
I've got the missing piece.

01:37:59.701 --> 01:38:01.734
It's Godzilla, right?

01:38:01.736 --> 01:38:03.572
- I know we already tried.
- It's not Godzilla.

01:38:04.339 --> 01:38:05.471
It's us.

01:38:05.473 --> 01:38:07.172
What do you mean "us"?

01:38:07.174 --> 01:38:09.441
Emma combined the bioacoustics
of Godzilla with a human.

01:38:09.443 --> 01:38:11.243
That's how she made
the signal for the ORCA.

01:38:11.245 --> 01:38:13.346
The creatures just think
it's another apex predator.

01:38:13.348 --> 01:38:14.914
Well, that makes sense.

01:38:14.916 --> 01:38:16.382
I mean, we are a bunch of
horny murderous carnivores.

01:38:16.384 --> 01:38:18.016
Yeah, that's real poetic.
Now what?

01:38:18.018 --> 01:38:21.152
We track it, we find it,
and we get my daughter back.

01:38:21.154 --> 01:38:24.589
What about Moe, Larry,
and Curly over here?

01:38:24.591 --> 01:38:26.558
Godzilla will bring balance.

01:38:26.560 --> 01:38:30.362
Oh, I get it. A little
Serizawa let-'em-fight action.

01:38:30.364 --> 01:38:32.531
I used to love it
when he said that.

01:38:32.533 --> 01:38:35.368
No. This time,
we join the fight.

01:38:39.206 --> 01:38:40.638
What do you think
you're doing?

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:42.173
I don't have time
to argue about this, Jonah.

01:38:42.175 --> 01:38:43.241
I'm getting Maddie back.

01:38:43.243 --> 01:38:45.210
Not with my men, you're not.

01:38:45.212 --> 01:38:47.713
Emma, you said this was about
the greater good.

01:38:47.715 --> 01:38:51.116
That the planet deserved
a clean slate.

01:38:51.118 --> 01:38:52.351
But now you're prepared

01:38:52.353 --> 01:38:53.619
to put all our lives in danger

01:38:53.621 --> 01:38:54.654
because your little girl
is missing.

01:38:54.656 --> 01:38:55.887
The ORCA is with...

01:38:55.889 --> 01:38:57.490
The ORCA
no longer matters.

01:38:57.492 --> 01:39:00.328
Man does not control
the laws of nature.

01:39:01.295 --> 01:39:02.997
And neither do you.

01:39:12.607 --> 01:39:17.977
I already lost one child.
I'm not losing another.

01:39:17.979 --> 01:39:19.981
I have to fix this.

01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:22.450
Let her go.

01:39:24.285 --> 01:39:26.488
We have everything we need.

01:41:28.142 --> 01:41:29.778
Oh, shit!

01:42:59.632 --> 01:43:01.933
Okay, we've zeroed in on
the last ping from the ORCA.

01:43:01.935 --> 01:43:03.602
Fenway Park, dead ahead.

01:43:03.604 --> 01:43:04.904
<i>We'll lay cover fire
to keep Ghidorah distracted.</i>

01:43:04.906 --> 01:43:06.608
Copy that.

01:43:08.843 --> 01:43:11.112
Colonel, all squadrons
are locked on target.

01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:14.282
For Serizawa.

01:43:48.215 --> 01:43:50.883
Is it just me
or has he been working out?

01:43:50.885 --> 01:43:53.052
Are you kidding me?

01:43:53.054 --> 01:43:54.518
Serizawa's got
that lizard juiced!

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:56.088
Damn right.

01:43:57.358 --> 01:43:59.790
Oh, boy.
Godzilla's radiation levels

01:43:59.792 --> 01:44:01.427
are going through the roof.

01:44:01.429 --> 01:44:03.962
We got about 12 minutes
before he goes thermonuclear.

01:44:03.964 --> 01:44:05.567
What do you mean?

01:44:07.033 --> 01:44:08.500
I'm saying
in about 12 minutes,

01:44:08.502 --> 01:44:10.802
it's gonna be a bad day
to be a Red Sox fan.

01:44:12.206 --> 01:44:13.972
Okay, guys,
you need to find the ORCA,

01:44:13.974 --> 01:44:15.807
get Madison,
and get the hell out of there.

01:44:15.809 --> 01:44:17.442
<i>Whatever Serizawa did
to Godzilla</i>

01:44:17.444 --> 01:44:19.078
<i>worked a little too well.</i>

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.812
<i>'Cause he's about to explode
like an atom bomb.</i>

01:44:20.814 --> 01:44:22.013
Roger that.

01:44:22.015 --> 01:44:23.684
Prepare for landing.

01:44:44.772 --> 01:44:46.972
Go, go, go!

01:44:46.974 --> 01:44:49.408
- Spread out!
- Flank left!

01:44:49.410 --> 01:44:50.612
On me!

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:02.924
Madison!

01:45:04.892 --> 01:45:07.362
I got something!
Over here.

01:45:08.362 --> 01:45:09.697
Come check this out!

01:45:12.398 --> 01:45:14.065
Are you all right?

01:45:14.067 --> 01:45:17.835
I found the ORCA, sir,
it looks pretty banged up!

01:45:17.837 --> 01:45:19.640
No sign of your daughter.

01:45:25.946 --> 01:45:27.411
She's not here!

01:45:27.413 --> 01:45:28.713
We gotta get out of here!

01:45:28.715 --> 01:45:29.916
Let's go!

01:46:45.326 --> 01:46:46.327
Get in!

01:46:48.828 --> 01:46:50.529
Incoming!

01:46:52.934 --> 01:46:53.999
Get in!

01:46:54.001 --> 01:46:56.234
Griffin, you all right?

01:46:56.236 --> 01:46:57.703
Martinez, let's get her up.

01:47:06.647 --> 01:47:07.945
Where's Madison?

01:47:07.947 --> 01:47:08.980
I don't know.
I thought she was there!

01:47:08.982 --> 01:47:10.218
Well, she's not there!

01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:13.918
Take it easy!

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:15.989
- Get that side.
- Okay, okay.

01:47:18.024 --> 01:47:19.393
Look out!

01:47:21.495 --> 01:47:22.828
I hope you're as good

01:47:22.830 --> 01:47:24.096
at finding her
as you are losing her.

01:47:24.098 --> 01:47:25.798
I didn't lose her,
she ran away.

01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:26.865
Well, gee, I wonder why!

01:47:26.867 --> 01:47:28.100
I can't blame that kid.

01:47:28.102 --> 01:47:29.767
If I had these two
for parents,

01:47:29.769 --> 01:47:31.238
I'd have run away
from home, too.

01:47:34.741 --> 01:47:36.074
What did you just say?

01:47:36.076 --> 01:47:37.875
If I had the two of you
for parents,

01:47:37.877 --> 01:47:39.546
I'd run away from home, too.

01:47:40.813 --> 01:47:41.879
Home.

01:48:54.487 --> 01:48:57.254
Godzilla's radiation's
reaching critical mass.

01:48:57.256 --> 01:48:59.191
Six minutes until he blows.

01:48:59.193 --> 01:49:01.128
Order all remaining craft
to retreat!

01:50:12.366 --> 01:50:14.167
Maddie!

01:50:15.001 --> 01:50:16.435
Madison!

01:50:16.437 --> 01:50:18.637
Maddie!

01:50:18.639 --> 01:50:20.405
Madison!

01:50:20.407 --> 01:50:22.606
Madison!

01:50:22.608 --> 01:50:25.011
Madison!

01:50:28.614 --> 01:50:29.684
Emma!

01:50:30.885 --> 01:50:31.950
Maddie!

01:50:31.952 --> 01:50:33.017
Martinez!

01:50:33.019 --> 01:50:35.119
We got it. On three.

01:50:35.121 --> 01:50:37.058
One, two, three...

01:50:39.059 --> 01:50:40.428
Lift together.

01:50:55.643 --> 01:50:57.377
Oh, my baby.

01:50:58.211 --> 01:50:59.844
Is she breathing?

01:50:59.846 --> 01:51:01.213
Mark, is she breathing?

01:51:01.215 --> 01:51:02.416
Maddie.

01:51:07.188 --> 01:51:08.522
Maddie.

01:51:11.024 --> 01:51:12.223
Maddie.

01:51:12.225 --> 01:51:13.825
Mom.

01:51:13.827 --> 01:51:16.061
- Dad.
- Shh.

01:51:16.063 --> 01:51:18.366
- Mom. Mom.
- We're here.

01:53:10.175 --> 01:53:11.477
Roger that.

01:53:11.479 --> 01:53:12.977
Osprey's coming
in two minutes.

01:53:12.979 --> 01:53:15.279
We gotta work fast.

01:53:15.281 --> 01:53:16.684
To do what?

01:53:19.486 --> 01:53:20.752
You sure about this?

01:53:20.754 --> 01:53:22.486
It's the only way
to save him.

01:53:22.488 --> 01:53:24.188
We fix it, get on the osprey

01:53:24.190 --> 01:53:25.790
and draw that thing away
from Godzilla.

01:53:25.792 --> 01:53:27.827
Buy him time to get back
on his feet.

01:53:39.239 --> 01:53:40.905
Mark, you've seen
what that thing can do.

01:53:40.907 --> 01:53:43.710
I know. It'll be tight, but
we have to take that chance.

01:53:50.584 --> 01:53:51.850
Are you good to go?

01:53:51.852 --> 01:53:52.918
Yes.

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:54.752
All right. One, two,

01:53:54.754 --> 01:53:55.820
three.

01:53:59.792 --> 01:54:00.991
That's it.

01:54:00.993 --> 01:54:02.160
That's it!

01:54:08.033 --> 01:54:09.636
Come on, Griff. We got you.

01:54:12.304 --> 01:54:13.972
Come on, Emma. Let's go.

01:54:13.974 --> 01:54:15.306
Okay. Take her. Take her!

01:54:15.308 --> 01:54:16.740
I still have to activate it.

01:54:16.742 --> 01:54:17.609
What?

01:54:17.611 --> 01:54:19.246
I'm right behind you. Go!

01:54:32.058 --> 01:54:33.491
Let's go, let's go!

01:54:33.493 --> 01:54:34.694
Mom!

01:54:35.962 --> 01:54:37.027
Mom!

01:54:37.029 --> 01:54:38.463
Come on, Maddie!

01:54:38.465 --> 01:54:40.467
Go, go, go!

01:54:44.504 --> 01:54:46.204
You got any pain anywhere
besides your leg?

01:54:53.179 --> 01:54:54.277
We gotta lift off, now!

01:54:54.279 --> 01:54:55.715
Wait!

01:55:05.358 --> 01:55:07.292
Emma, let's go!
Come on!

01:55:07.294 --> 01:55:08.662
Mom!

01:55:17.304 --> 01:55:18.639
Mom.

01:55:19.471 --> 01:55:21.138
I love you.

01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:23.243
No.

01:55:24.344 --> 01:55:26.244
- No!
- Emma!

01:55:26.246 --> 01:55:28.545
Mom!

01:56:05.117 --> 01:56:06.319
No.

01:56:08.154 --> 01:56:09.355
No.

01:56:26.973 --> 01:56:29.510
Mom!

01:56:55.501 --> 01:56:59.038
Long live the king.

01:59:17.143 --> 01:59:19.442
Jesus.

01:59:19.444 --> 01:59:21.612
Good thing he's on our side.

01:59:21.614 --> 01:59:23.550
For now.

01:59:25.084 --> 01:59:26.252
Look.

02:10:40.926 --> 02:10:43.360
It's a brave new world,
my friend.

02:10:43.362 --> 02:10:44.928
Such things as this

02:10:44.930 --> 02:10:48.399
become much more valuable
since the rise of the king.

02:10:48.401 --> 02:10:50.167
My men,
they don't ask for much.

02:10:50.169 --> 02:10:52.168
Can't fish here anymore.

02:10:52.170 --> 02:10:53.906
Everything's dead.

02:11:27.305 --> 02:11:29.509
We'll take it.
