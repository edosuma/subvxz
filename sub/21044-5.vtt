00:37.328 --> 00:39.999
Uh, wait, this is for 303! Um...

00:40.123 --> 00:41.332
-Isn't that for me?
-Oh...

00:41.876 --> 00:43.126
-Oh, you're... No.
-My gosh.

00:43.209 --> 00:44.920
No, no, no, no, no!
You have to sign for this.

00:45.004 --> 00:46.672
Mister, she has to sign for it, come back!

00:46.755 --> 00:48.966
-You have to...
-Why would you sign for someone else?

What are you doing here?

01:00.769 --> 01:02.021
[sighs]

01:02.145 --> 01:03.731
You ignored my text.

01:05.024 --> 01:07.192
Why didn't you reply?

01:07.275 --> 01:08.861
You need to come back to the restaurant.

01:09.904 --> 01:11.321
I thought I was fired.

01:11.404 --> 01:12.948
No, you're not.

01:13.032 --> 01:14.825
So you should come back.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.493
[foot stomps]

01:16.577 --> 01:17.620
Because?

01:18.286 --> 01:19.872
Because I need a sous-chef.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.626
And?

01:23.709 --> 01:27.087
And I enjoy cooking with you.

01:29.547 --> 01:30.674
And he's sorry.

01:33.551 --> 01:35.012
You are?

01:35.095 --> 01:36.471
[clears throat] Yes.

01:36.554 --> 01:37.848

02:04.290 --> 02:05.918
and the rest afterwards.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.757
"Sort of"?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.050
I'm not entirely sorry

02:13.133 --> 02:15.094
because it's not entirely my fault.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.595
You're entirely a jackass.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.514
I thought you wanted
your restaurant to succeed!

02:19.597 --> 02:20.473
Of course, I do!

02:20.683 --> 02:22.977
Well it's not going to happen without her!

02:23.060 --> 02:26.479
You're screwing everything up

-Get out of the car!

02:54.299 --> 02:55.633
I don't have an ego!

03:01.932 --> 03:03.809
No good, narcissistic,

03:03.892 --> 03:04.977
condescending,

03:05.060 --> 03:07.478
beautiful, all leading men are the worst!

03:09.647 --> 03:10.648
Okay.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.277
Something bad is about to happen.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.206
Weird.

[screams]

[Ga-in]
<i>He hasn't hired a new sous-chef yet</i>

04:04.953 --> 04:06.789

he's starting to come around.

04:06.997 --> 04:08.040
What's going on?

04:08.289 --> 04:11.626
I asked Ga-in to come by
with the quarterlies for your restaurant.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.378
Manager Kim came to lend us a hand.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.587
I see.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.298
Sit down, I'll go make some coffee.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.300
No, I'll do it.

04:31.814 --> 04:33.356
Are you sure this will work?

04:34.482 --> 04:35.525
Just text her.

04:36.819 --> 04:37.945
I'll get him.

Please, please, go according to plan.

Are you still out of work?

04:49.414 --> 04:50.540
Mm...

04:50.748 --> 04:53.252
You could work here,
if you like.

Got a surprise!

05:05.097 --> 05:07.473
-I've got to go.
-Hm?

05:07.557 --> 05:08.641
Oh, okay.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.023
Honestly, Mom,

05:15.107 --> 05:17.276
there must be someone
more qualified for this job than I am.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.611
Your father wanted the company
to stay in the family.

05:21.196 --> 05:22.239
[Ga-in] Mrs. Park,

05:22.488 --> 05:26.201
what if Joon and I got married,
and I took the job?

05:26.409 --> 05:27.452
What?

05:30.122 --> 05:31.874
Think about it.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.836
[Ga-in] Then Joon could focus
on the restaurant and--

05:35.919 --> 05:36.920
Ga-in!

05:37.212 --> 05:40.590
I've been waiting to marry you
since we were children, Joon.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.509
All right,
I'll discuss it with your parents.

05:43.593 --> 05:44.887

Who is she?

06:07.742 --> 06:09.702
-Joon!
-Claire?

06:09.786 --> 06:11.496
I'm so sorry, but I need Joon.

06:11.579 --> 06:12.705
[Ga-in] You can't!

06:13.332 --> 06:15.209
Right now, it's an emergency.

Okay.

06:33.434 --> 06:34.978
All part of the plan.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.278

07:00.670 --> 07:03.756
Yeah, an emergency to get you away
from Ga-in and your mother.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.092
What?

07:05.384 --> 07:07.219
We just need to go to the restaurant.

07:43.921 --> 07:45.340
Not having a sous-chef,

07:47.050 --> 07:48.885
working on my own,

07:49.344 --> 07:52.431
I've been questioning a lot of things.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.640
I mean,

07:55.100 --> 07:56.435
what am I doing?

07:56.934 --> 07:59.854
What's the point of the restaurant

07:59.937 --> 08:02.274
or even my life, for that matter?

08:03.941 --> 08:04.942
Anyhow,
