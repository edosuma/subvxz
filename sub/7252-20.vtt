Super idea.

- Hello.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.324
What are you

02:36.197 --> 02:37.324
thinkin' about?

02:37.365 --> 02:38.867
Whether you've ever

02:37.365 --> 02:38.867
woken up

02:38.909 --> 02:40.119
with Paris standing

02:38.909 --> 02:40.119
over you with a knife.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.996
Not recently.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.996
She's been in a good mood.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.872
- Why's that?

02:42.037 --> 02:43.872
- Because she's in love.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.540
- With Doyle?

02:43.914 --> 02:45.540
- Yes, with Doyle.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.126
And do not mock or make fun.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.377
Because when Paris is happy,

02:47.167 --> 02:49.377
the whole world is happy.

02:49.419 --> 02:52.255
But when she's not happy,

02:49.419 --> 02:52.255
the world is "Deadwood."

Hey, what do you think

02:57.427 --> 02:59.054
of this dress?

02:59.096 --> 03:01.890
- Is this newspapery enough?

02:59.096 --> 03:01.890
- What?

03:01.932 --> 03:03.976
I'm trying to figure out

03:01.932 --> 03:03.976
what to wear to the paper.

03:04.018 --> 03:06.185
Ah, the internship rears

03:06.227 --> 03:08.856
but not too Lois Laney.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.607

03:08.897 --> 03:10.607
like a college kid.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.776
- You are a college kid.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.776
- Not on Monday.

03:12.818 --> 03:15.236
On Monday,

03:12.818 --> 03:15.236
I am a newspaperwoman

03:15.278 --> 03:17.405
and I have to look

03:15.278 --> 03:17.405
like a newspaperwoman.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.782
Whatever you wear will be fine.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.784
- I'm so excited.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.784
- I can tell.

03:20.826 --> 03:24.830
Oh, last night, I couldn't

03:20.826 --> 03:24.830
sleep, so I googled your father.

03:24.872 --> 03:28.500
- Excuse me?

03:24.872 --> 03:28.500
- 12,053 items came up.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.002
I could only pull up

03:28.542 --> 03:30.002
a couple of thousand

03:30.044 --> 03:31.503
but it really helped.

03:31.545 --> 03:34.381
He was born in 1953,

03:31.545 --> 03:34.381
Episcopalian

03:34.422 --> 03:36.341
second of four children,

03:34.422 --> 03:36.341
oldest boy

03:36.383 --> 03:38.135
Yale undergrad,

03:36.383 --> 03:38.135
star of the track team

03:38.177 --> 03:39.761
no grad school,

03:38.177 --> 03:39.761
interesting.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.429
Then he had a couple

03:39.803 --> 03:41.429
of lost years

03:41.471 --> 03:44.516
kind of a blank period, a little

03:41.471 --> 03:44.516
Jesus thing going on there.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.476
Worked as a reporter

03:44.558 --> 03:46.476
and editor

03:46.518 --> 03:48.062
for two of the Huntzberger

03:46.518 --> 03:48.062
papers

03:48.103 --> 03:50.313
before taking over

03:48.103 --> 03:50.313
as CEO of the company.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.440
I mean, when you look at

03:50.355 --> 03:52.440
all of his accomplishments

03:52.482 --> 03:54.359
the man must never sleep.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.361
Mm-hmm. Four hours a night,

03:54.401 --> 03:56.361
just like Clinton.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.905
You don't have a wall

03:56.403 --> 03:57.905
in a secret room

03:57.946 --> 03:59.823
with pictures of my father

03:57.946 --> 03:59.823
pasted all over it, do you?

03:59.865 --> 04:02.576
Logan, I'm going to be

03:59.865 --> 04:02.576
interning for him.

04:02.617 --> 04:03.952
I need to know

04:02.617 --> 04:03.952
everything about him.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.495
Is he an egghead?

04:05.537 --> 04:07.039
Because he seems

04:05.537 --> 04:07.039
very roll-up-the-sleeves-y.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.582
But he's written

04:07.081 --> 04:08.582
about everything

04:08.623 --> 04:11.210
from foreign affairs,

04:08.623 --> 04:11.210
domestic policies.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.128
He had a wine column

04:11.251 --> 04:13.128
for God's sake.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.337
I should learn

04:13.170 --> 04:14.337
more about wine.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.797
- Look, Rory--

04:14.379 --> 04:15.797
- What are his politics?

04:15.839 --> 04:17.716
He's unbelievably neutral

04:15.839 --> 04:17.716
in his writing.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.718
Right-wing, left-wing,

04:17.758 --> 04:19.718
middle-wing?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.803
Oh, the man was short-listed

04:19.760 --> 04:21.803
for the Pulitzer

04:21.845 --> 04:24.347
for covering the Iranian

04:21.845 --> 04:24.347
hostage crisis when he was 25.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.682
Yeah, I heard

04:24.389 --> 04:25.682
something about that.

04:25.724 --> 04:27.517
Twenty-five

04:25.724 --> 04:27.517
how did he do that?

04:27.559 --> 04:29.519
Especially considering

04:27.559 --> 04:29.519
his lost years.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.730
He's a born journalist.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.482
I mean, what does he read?

04:31.772 --> 04:34.482
What papers, what journals?

04:34.524 --> 04:35.901
Come on, tell me somethin'.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.194
He hates peas.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.862
Logan, I need your help here.

04:38.904 --> 04:41.073
Rory, my dad and I basically

04:38.904 --> 04:41.073
have two conversations.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.866
Logan, you're not

04:41.115 --> 04:42.866
living up to your potential

04:42.908 --> 04:44.576
and, Logan, when

04:42.908 --> 04:44.576
you're sailing close hauled

04:44.618 --> 04:46.078
wait until you gain

04:44.618 --> 04:46.078
that last bit of boat speed

04:46.120 --> 04:47.788
before you pull in

04:47.829 --> 04:48.997
- But--

04:47.829 --> 04:48.997
- Ace..

04:49.039 --> 04:50.207
You've learned more

04:49.039 --> 04:50.207
about my father in one day

04:50.249 --> 04:51.332
than I've learned

04:50.249 --> 04:51.332
my whole life.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.376
Don't worry.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.376
You're gonna be fine.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.295
Now, I thought we'd established

04:53.418 --> 04:55.295
we're both starving.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.380
Yes, we have.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.380
Let's go.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.717
Oh, wait.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.553
Your dad covered Haiti

05:00.759 --> 05:03.553
in 1985.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.222
Must learn more

05:03.595 --> 05:05.222
about Haiti. Got it.

05:05.264 --> 05:07.015
Okay, let's go.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.600
Hey, have you ever

05:07.057 --> 05:08.600
discussed Pinochet with him?

05:08.642 --> 05:10.727
- Because one time, he wrote--

05:08.642 --> 05:10.727
- Peas, ace, peas.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.520
Right, sorry.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.523
As we move on from the

05:12.562 --> 05:15.523
empiricists to the rationalists

05:15.565 --> 05:17.317
it would be good to start

05:15.565 --> 05:17.317
thinkin' about the difference

05:17.358 --> 05:19.278
between the a posteriori truths

05:19.319 --> 05:21.404
and the a priori truths

05:19.319 --> 05:21.404
of the rationalists

05:21.446 --> 05:23.782
which exist

05:21.446 --> 05:23.782
independent of experience.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.784
So, for Wednesday,

05:23.824 --> 05:25.784
if you'd all take a crack

05:25.826 --> 05:29.246
at the first five chapters

05:25.826 --> 05:29.246
of Spinoza's "Ethics."

05:29.288 --> 05:31.498
That is, those of you

05:29.288 --> 05:31.498
whose entire weekend

05:31.539 --> 05:35.252
won't be consumed by books

05:31.539 --> 05:35.252
on wine and Haiti.

05:35.294 --> 05:39.047
Yes, my interests

05:35.294 --> 05:39.047
are teasingly diverse.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.339
Whatever.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.341
See you all on Wednesday.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.101
- Oh, thank God!

05:51.143 --> 05:52.560
Did you return

05:51.143 --> 05:52.560
the blue sweater?

05:52.602 --> 05:53.895
- 'Oh, no.'

05:52.602 --> 05:53.895
- Answer, please.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.689
- 'Two days ago.'

05:53.937 --> 05:55.689
- Why?

05:55.730 --> 05:58.525
Why? Because, two days ago,

05:55.730 --> 05:58.525
you asked me to take it back.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.235
Demanded me, in fact.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.653
And suddenly, you're

just so freakin' reliable

06:03.488 --> 06:06.241
I've always been freakin'

06:03.488 --> 06:06.241
reliable. It's how I was raised.

06:06.283 --> 06:07.701
So blame me.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.536
I am not returning

06:07.742 --> 06:09.536
the blue sweater again.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.080
- So don't think about asking.

06:09.577 --> 06:12.080
- But I want it. I need it.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.499
I've already returned

06:12.122 --> 06:14.499
the Capri pants twice.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.626
I've tried to return

06:14.541 --> 06:16.626
a couple of your other items

06:16.668 --> 06:18.086
that were all sales final

06:18.128 --> 06:19.713
which makes me look

06:18.128 --> 06:19.713
retail-simple.

06:19.754 --> 06:21.840
And this is not the first

06:19.754 --> 06:21.840
but the second time

06:21.882 --> 06:23.550
I will have returned

06:21.882 --> 06:23.550
the blue sweater.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.760
Oh, the Capri pants,

06:23.591 --> 06:25.760
have you taken those back yet?

06:25.802 --> 06:28.138
I can't show my face

06:25.802 --> 06:28.138
in any stores in New Haven.

06:28.180 --> 06:29.514
They think

06:28.180 --> 06:29.514
I'm paper mooning them.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.308
Oh, she was very cute

06:29.556 --> 06:31.308
in "Paper Moon."

06:31.350 --> 06:32.809
You're very cute, too.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.519
Calling me cute is not

06:32.851 --> 06:34.519
going to persuade me.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.104
And I have classes, a life.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.939
Monday afternoon,

06:36.146 --> 06:37.939
that's your free time, right?

06:37.981 --> 06:39.524
I remember some bragging

06:37.981 --> 06:39.524
to that effect.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.569
- Go back on Monday.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.569
- Well, Monday used to be free.

06:42.610 --> 06:44.487
Used to be?

06:42.610 --> 06:44.487
It's not free anymore?

06:44.529 --> 06:46.323
I guess we haven't talked

06:44.529 --> 06:46.323
in a couple of days.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.700
Um, I actually

06:46.365 --> 06:48.700
got an internship.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.244
'Really?'

06:50.285 --> 06:52.662
Kind of an important,

06:50.285 --> 06:52.662
high-profile one.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.539
Wow, that's great!

06:54.581 --> 06:57.042
It's for a newspaper in Stanford

06:54.581 --> 06:57.042
that Logan's dad acquired.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.459
He offered me the spot

06:57.084 --> 06:58.459
himself.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.878
Logan's dad.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.546
'Yeah. It was kind of

06:59.920 --> 07:01.546
out of the blue.'

07:01.588 --> 07:03.257
So when did you hear?

07:03.298 --> 07:05.550
Just a few days ago.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.550
I forgot I hadn't told you.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.634
I start on Monday.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.553
Wow, congratulations.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.305
'It's a pretty amazing

07:08.595 --> 07:10.305
opportunity.'

07:10.347 --> 07:12.349
Yeah, sounds like it.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.349
You'll be..

07:12.391 --> 07:14.434
...having lunch with the op-ed

07:12.391 --> 07:14.434
editors from the Times

07:14.475 --> 07:15.727
hanging out

07:14.475 --> 07:15.727
with Peter Jennings.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.771
Dan Rather will be

07:15.769 --> 07:17.771
valet parking your car.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.480
Yeah, it's more likely that

07:17.812 --> 07:19.480
I'll be pulling wire reports

07:19.522 --> 07:21.316
off the AP Machine,

07:19.522 --> 07:21.316
but sure.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.484
Good, good. So, no worries

07:21.358 --> 07:23.484
on the blue sweater front.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.070
'It's off my radar screen.'

07:25.112 --> 07:26.738
Really? So you're

07:25.112 --> 07:26.738
not gonna make the effort?

07:26.780 --> 07:29.283
- I'll see if I can on Tuesday.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.283
- Just send your assistant.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.700
You're getting an

07:29.324 --> 07:30.700
assistant, right?

07:30.742 --> 07:32.452
Oh, I'm sure.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.452
I'll see you Friday night.

07:32.493 --> 07:33.912
- 'Bye, hon.'

07:32.493 --> 07:33.912
- Bye.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.292
Taylor? Hello?

07:35.330 --> 07:38.292
Is someone out there?

07:38.333 --> 07:39.876
Where are you, Taylor?

07:39.918 --> 07:43.838
(Taylor)

07:39.918 --> 07:43.838
'Over here. I can't move.'

07:43.880 --> 07:47.884
Oh, I have got to

07:43.880 --> 07:47.884
get a camera.

07:47.926 --> 07:49.594
How the hell

07:47.926 --> 07:49.594
did you do this?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.471
I was doing a little

07:49.636 --> 07:51.471
light dusting

07:51.512 --> 07:52.973
and was toying

07:51.512 --> 07:52.973
with the idea

07:53.014 --> 07:55.267
of repositioning

07:53.014 --> 07:55.267
the horse's hindquarters

07:55.309 --> 07:56.768
and the whole thing

07:55.309 --> 07:56.768
came tumbling down.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.270
You can't leave

07:56.810 --> 07:58.270
anything alone, can you?

07:58.312 --> 08:00.063
Are you going to

07:58.312 --> 08:00.063
help me or not?

08:00.105 --> 08:02.065
'I feel like I've been

08:00.105 --> 08:02.065
lying here for days.'

08:02.107 --> 08:03.775
You have not been

08:02.107 --> 08:03.775
lying here for days.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.693
Kirk came into the diner

08:03.817 --> 08:05.693
two hours ago.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.695
You waited two hours

08:05.735 --> 08:07.695
to come and get me?

08:07.737 --> 08:09.197
I have a business.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.698
I can't come running

08:09.239 --> 08:10.698
every time

08:10.740 --> 08:13.368
a family of mannequins

08:10.740 --> 08:13.368
decides to attack you.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.621
- Just lie still.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.621
- This is so humiliating.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.416
- Don't you think it's time?

08:16.663 --> 08:19.416
- Time for what?

08:19.458 --> 08:21.335
You've been trapped under

08:19.458 --> 08:21.335
the Jebediahs for two hours

08:21.376 --> 08:23.044
and no one has come in here.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.421
What's your point, Luke?

08:24.463 --> 08:26.423
My point is,

08:24.463 --> 08:26.423
the museum's a bust.

08:26.465 --> 08:29.259
I'll admit, attendance is low.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.094
No one is coming.

08:31.136 --> 08:34.764
I was reading an article about

08:31.136 --> 08:34.764
the power of bus-bench ads

08:34.806 --> 08:35.807
for getting the word out.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.851
Very big in the music industry.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.687
Apparently, the rapper

08:37.892 --> 08:40.687
50 Cent swears by them.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.689
Taylor, come on.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.689
isn't it time to sell?

08:42.730 --> 08:45.692
Let somebody who really

08:42.730 --> 08:45.692
wants this place have it.

08:45.733 --> 08:49.112
Yeah, I guess it is.

08:45.733 --> 08:49.112
I had such dreams.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.240
- There'll be other dreams.

08:49.154 --> 08:52.240
- I guess.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.951
You can resume your attempts

08:52.282 --> 08:54.951
to get me out of here.

08:54.993 --> 08:57.078
You're definitely

08:54.993 --> 08:57.078
ready to sell the house?

08:57.120 --> 08:58.413
Yes.

08:58.455 --> 09:01.166
Then let's get you

08:58.455 --> 09:01.166
out of here.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.126
(Rory)

09:01.208 --> 09:03.126
'Tennis lessons.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.126
That sounds great, grandma.'

09:03.168 --> 09:04.711
I've always liked tennis.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.713
And I have to say

09:04.752 --> 09:06.713
I'm excited by the prospect

09:06.754 --> 09:08.840
of getting some good

09:06.754 --> 09:08.840
healthy exercise.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.926
I'm excited by the prospect of

09:08.882 --> 09:11.926
those fetching tennis costumes.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.470
Richard, not in front of Rory.

09:13.512 --> 09:15.180
Oh, I'm fairly worldly now,

09:13.512 --> 09:15.180
grandma.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.931
She was a heck

09:15.222 --> 09:16.931
of a tennis player in her day.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.434
- And very competitive.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.434
- I wasn't that competitive.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.728
This woman was kicked off

09:19.476 --> 09:21.728
the field hockey team at Smith

09:21.769 --> 09:24.189
for elbowing Ceacy Evertz

09:21.769 --> 09:24.189
in the neck.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.606
She got in my way.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.983
This happened in the parking lot

09:25.648 --> 09:26.983
after the game.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.609
Now, now.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.111
Rory, tell us a little

09:28.651 --> 09:30.111
more about this internship.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.238
It sounds very exciting.

09:31.279 --> 09:32.780
Well, all I really know

09:31.279 --> 09:32.780
is that

09:32.822 --> 09:34.991
I'm going to be shadowing

09:32.822 --> 09:34.991
Mitchum Huntzberger

09:35.033 --> 09:36.368
just to sort of learn

09:35.033 --> 09:36.368
and observe

09:36.410 --> 09:37.744
plus pitching in

09:36.410 --> 09:37.744
here and there.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.829
You are going to learn

09:37.785 --> 09:39.829
a hell of a lot.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.706
It was very sweet of Logan

09:39.871 --> 09:41.706
to arrange this for you.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.291
Well, actually,

09:41.748 --> 09:43.291
Mitchum Huntzberger

09:43.333 --> 09:44.709
offered it to me himself.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.753
- Really?

09:44.751 --> 09:46.753
- 'How about that?'

09:46.794 --> 09:48.255
He just called you up?

09:48.296 --> 09:50.257
Your reputation for excellence

09:48.296 --> 09:50.257
preceded you?

09:50.298 --> 09:52.426
Well, he came by Yale,

09:50.298 --> 09:52.426
actually.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.344
I had met him when I had dinner

09:52.467 --> 09:54.344
at his house, and--

09:54.386 --> 09:55.678
Dinner? What dinner?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.431
Just a dinner

09:55.720 --> 09:57.431
that Logan took me to.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.724
- At the Huntzbergers' house?

09:57.472 --> 09:59.724
- Well, yes.

09:59.766 --> 10:02.352
- When? When?

09:59.766 --> 10:02.352
- About a week ago, I guess.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.229
- Good Lord.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.229
- It's already been a week.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.439
We need to invite

10:04.271 --> 10:05.439
him right away.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.523
- Who?

10:05.480 --> 10:06.523
- 'Logan.'

10:06.565 --> 10:08.233
The ball's been dropped.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.650
I put an invite in the mail

10:08.275 --> 10:09.650
first thing tomorrow.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.069
'We really should've

10:09.692 --> 10:11.069
had him over first.'

10:11.111 --> 10:12.946
We probably should

10:11.111 --> 10:12.946
call him as well.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.822
We could messenger an invite

10:12.987 --> 10:14.822
tonight. It isn't even 8:00.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.450
Well, it's really nice of you

10:14.864 --> 10:16.450
to want to have him over.

10:16.491 --> 10:17.951
Really.

10:16.491 --> 10:17.951
But you don't need--

10:17.992 --> 10:19.702
Rory, if you could

10:17.992 --> 10:19.702
mention it to him yourself

10:19.744 --> 10:21.871
preferably tonight, I'll get

10:19.744 --> 10:21.871
a note over to him tomorrow.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.082
- He'll need a choice of dates.

10:21.913 --> 10:24.082
- I'll get my book.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.750
I'll get mine, too.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.088
Rory?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.172
I'll call him now.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.716
- Right now. Right now.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.716
- Okay.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.929
[telephone ringing]

10:37.971 --> 10:39.347
Hello?

10:39.389 --> 10:40.599
Listen, you're going

10:39.389 --> 10:40.599
to be getting a note

10:40.640 --> 10:42.183
from the Gilmores

10:40.640 --> 10:42.183
sometime soon

10:42.225 --> 10:44.436
maybe in the mail,

10:42.225 --> 10:44.436
maybe hand-delivered tonight.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.770
For all I know,

10:44.478 --> 10:45.770
a carrier pigeon is heading

10:45.812 --> 10:47.105
for your room as we speak.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.356
You might wanna

10:47.147 --> 10:48.356
open your window.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.066
Why is a carrier pigeon

10:48.398 --> 10:50.066
heading here?

10:50.108 --> 10:51.901
They want to have you over

10:50.108 --> 10:51.901
for dinner.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.027
Oh.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.362
'They're flipping out about it.'

10:54.404 --> 10:56.448
She's sending an apology

10:54.404 --> 10:56.448
for being so remiss

10:56.490 --> 10:59.075
as to wait one whole week since

10:56.490 --> 10:59.075
I had to dinner at your house

10:59.117 --> 11:00.118
to extend an invitation.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.828
I mean, they're losing it.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.331
'So, I'm calling to warn you,

11:01.869 --> 11:04.331
and I want you to know'

11:04.372 --> 11:06.207
I didn't suggest

11:04.372 --> 11:06.207
us having dinner with them

11:06.249 --> 11:07.875
or encourage it in any way.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.670
And I definitely did not

11:07.917 --> 11:10.670
refer to you as my B-word

11:10.711 --> 11:13.465
in front of them,

11:10.711 --> 11:13.465
or even imply it in any way.

11:13.507 --> 11:15.008
'Cause you know,

11:13.507 --> 11:15.008
I'm really happy with the way

11:15.049 --> 11:16.301
things have been going

11:16.343 --> 11:17.885
and I don't want

11:16.343 --> 11:17.885
any pressure put on us.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.513
And I'm sorry, and I think

11:17.927 --> 11:19.513
I already said that.

11:19.554 --> 11:20.805
And that's it.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.390
What are the odds

11:20.847 --> 11:22.390
of getting out of this?

11:22.432 --> 11:24.225
- Pretty much zero.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.225
- Then let's do it.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.019
- 'Really?'

11:24.267 --> 11:26.019
- Yeah, it won't be so bad.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.438
Wow. You are a true gentleman.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.440
[window slams]

11:28.480 --> 11:30.440
Oh, my God. What was that?

11:30.482 --> 11:33.193
Carrier pigeon. Poor thing.

11:30.482 --> 11:33.193
Should've opened the window.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.153
- 'Not funny.'

11:33.234 --> 11:35.153
- Kind of funny.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.946
- Bye.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.946
- 'Bye.'

11:38.948 --> 11:42.035
Burger rare, cheddar cheese,

11:38.948 --> 11:42.035
barbecue sauce on the side.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.621
- Hey, save Rory some lemon pie.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.621
- Rory's comin' in tonight?

11:44.663 --> 11:46.122
Yeah, she's going to see

11:44.663 --> 11:46.122
Lane's band play

11:46.164 --> 11:47.624
at Plaza Duplo

11:46.164 --> 11:47.624
4th Street tonight.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.042
They have the coveted

11:47.666 --> 11:49.042
three-in-the-morning slot.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.585
I hear that's how

11:49.083 --> 11:50.585
Zeppelin started.

11:50.627 --> 11:53.129
Yeah. Her genius plan

11:50.627 --> 11:53.129
is to come home, go to bed early

11:53.171 --> 11:55.298
set the clock for 2:00,

11:53.171 --> 11:55.298
get up, and go rock.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.715
- Solid plan.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.715
- Yes.

11:56.757 --> 11:58.426
Except that when

11:56.757 --> 11:58.426
the clock goes off at 2:00

11:58.468 --> 12:01.137
she will be dead asleep and

11:58.468 --> 12:01.137
won't hear it, I however, will.

12:01.179 --> 12:04.057
I will then proceed to get up,

12:01.179 --> 12:04.057
drag myself downstairs

12:04.098 --> 12:06.142
recreating a classic

12:04.098 --> 12:06.142
Zucker brothers' moment

12:06.184 --> 12:07.477
and then I'll shake her awake.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.103
She'll get up,

12:07.519 --> 12:09.103
throw on some jeans

12:09.145 --> 12:11.690
a t-shirt, no makeup

12:09.145 --> 12:11.690
and look like a Neutrogena ad.

12:11.730 --> 12:14.401
'Whereas, once she leaves,

12:11.730 --> 12:14.401
I'll pass out on the couch'

12:14.442 --> 12:17.237
too exhausted to make it

12:14.442 --> 12:17.237
all the way upstairs.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.322
And in the morning,

12:17.278 --> 12:19.322
I will have bags under my eyes

12:19.364 --> 12:20.574
that should have Tumi

12:19.364 --> 12:20.574
stamped on them.

12:20.615 --> 12:21.949
I love being a mom.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.826
(male #1)

12:21.991 --> 12:23.826
'Oh, God. Watch your back.'

12:26.287 --> 12:28.456
Are the guys in town

12:26.287 --> 12:28.456
unusually lonely these days?

12:28.498 --> 12:29.916
No, they're from the museum.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.125
I think they're getting

12:29.957 --> 12:31.125
ready to close it.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.877
Close it? No. Why?

12:32.919 --> 12:35.004
Well, you know,

12:32.919 --> 12:35.004
no one was going.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.715
- I was going.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.715
- Yeah, well, you went once.

12:36.755 --> 12:39.342
No, I was gonna go again

12:36.755 --> 12:39.342
just as soon as the nightmares

12:39.384 --> 12:41.177
about the I love Jesus

12:39.384 --> 12:41.177
mannequin subsided.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.346
- Well, you saw it once.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.346
- I guess.

12:44.931 --> 12:46.683
Here's your sweater,

12:44.931 --> 12:46.683
and I hope you're happy.

12:46.725 --> 12:47.808
'Cause the saleswoman

12:46.725 --> 12:47.808
called me a name.

12:47.850 --> 12:49.018
Where's my pie?

12:49.060 --> 12:50.395
Luke, pie!

12:51.854 --> 12:53.273
- What do we think?

12:51.854 --> 12:53.273
- It's great.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.066
- Huh.

12:53.314 --> 12:55.066
- No.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.736
- I thought it was light blue.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.736
- No. It was dark blue.

12:57.776 --> 12:59.904
Did they have one

12:57.776 --> 12:59.904
that was light blue?

12:59.946 --> 13:01.780
You are officially banned

12:59.946 --> 13:01.780
from ever shopping

13:01.822 --> 13:03.032
in New Haven again.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.325
Thank God, I have you

13:03.074 --> 13:04.325
to do it for me.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.784
Hey, Luke.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.784
You're the only one

13:05.826 --> 13:06.869
I like around here

13:05.826 --> 13:06.869
at the moment.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.622
Right back at you.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.665
Okay, so, other than

13:08.663 --> 13:10.665
your stylist duties

13:10.707 --> 13:12.542
what else is going on in the

13:10.707 --> 13:12.542
life of the young and hopeful?

13:12.584 --> 13:14.043
I'm considering taking Russian.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.003
- Very practical. How's Logan?

13:14.085 --> 13:16.003
- He's fine.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.298
Grandma and grandpa

13:16.045 --> 13:18.298
invited him to dinner.

13:18.339 --> 13:19.758
It was actually

13:18.339 --> 13:19.758
less of an invite

13:19.798 --> 13:21.134
and more of a freak-out.

13:21.175 --> 13:22.719
They heard about

13:21.175 --> 13:22.719
the dinner I went to.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.971
- Heard how much?

13:22.761 --> 13:24.971
- The Reader's Digest version.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.014
Apparently, they've already

13:25.012 --> 13:27.014
exceeded the polite

13:27.056 --> 13:29.601
reciprocal-invite window and if

13:27.056 --> 13:29.601
he doesn't come to dinner soon

13:29.643 --> 13:31.018
Grandma has to give back

13:29.643 --> 13:31.018
her pearls.

13:31.060 --> 13:34.355
Wow. So, when is this dinner

13:31.060 --> 13:34.355
happening?

13:34.397 --> 13:35.814
Three dates were proposed.

13:35.856 --> 13:37.066
Logan's picking one of them.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.444
Ah. Should be

13:37.108 --> 13:39.444
an interesting evening.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.529
Yep. I'll take notes

13:39.486 --> 13:41.529
and pictures.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.491
Cool. Okay, you do that.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.493
- I want to go to dinner.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.493
- Where's the clock?

13:46.534 --> 13:48.035
I mean, you said that I could

13:46.534 --> 13:48.035
meet Logan properly

13:48.077 --> 13:49.870
and you know how good I am

13:48.077 --> 13:49.870
when there's food involved.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.414
12:30?

13:51.456 --> 13:53.750
I mean, is there a reason

13:51.456 --> 13:53.750
I wasn't invited?

13:53.792 --> 13:54.793
Can't we talk about

13:53.792 --> 13:54.793
this tomorrow?

13:54.833 --> 13:56.503
It is tomorrow.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.588
I just don't think it's right

13:56.544 --> 13:58.588
that they get first dibs on him.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.298
I mean, I am your mom,

13:58.630 --> 14:00.298
and we are very close

14:00.340 --> 14:01.424
in case you haven't heard.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.883
And I should get

14:01.466 --> 14:02.883
to know him first.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.969
Grandma and grandpa

14:02.925 --> 14:04.969
already know him.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.764
Okay, so they have

14:05.011 --> 14:07.764
a head start. Fine.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.516
But I bet they don't

14:07.806 --> 14:09.516
know him know him

14:09.557 --> 14:11.726
like I will know him

14:09.557 --> 14:11.726
if you let me go to dinner.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.436
I didn't think you'd want

14:11.768 --> 14:13.436
to come to dinner.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.979
Why not?

14:15.021 --> 14:16.939
Well, it's at their house,

14:15.021 --> 14:16.939
first of all.

14:16.981 --> 14:20.067
And I don't know how you feel

14:16.981 --> 14:20.067
about the Logan situation.

14:20.109 --> 14:23.446
Hey. This guy is in your life,

14:20.109 --> 14:23.446
and I wanna know him.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.905
Don't you want me

14:23.488 --> 14:24.905
to know him?

14:24.947 --> 14:26.700
Of course I want you

14:24.947 --> 14:26.700
to know him.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.326
Okay, so?

14:28.368 --> 14:29.786
I'd love for you

14:28.368 --> 14:29.786
to come to dinner.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.580
Great. Good.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.580
You call grandma for me.

14:32.622 --> 14:34.457
- 'No way.'

14:32.622 --> 14:34.457
- Why not?

14:34.499 --> 14:36.751
You want to come to dinner,

14:34.499 --> 14:36.751
you call grandma.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.586
But I'm not talking to grandma.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.505
Well, you're gonna have to talk

14:38.628 --> 14:40.505
to her if you come to dinner.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.048
- No, I won't.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.048
- Mom!

14:42.089 --> 14:45.134
No, I am there to talk to Logan.

14:42.089 --> 14:45.134
To get to know him.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.261
I mean, other than

14:45.176 --> 14:47.261
the fact that he's blond

14:47.303 --> 14:48.847
rich, and straight, I'm out.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.140
You're not gonna come to dinner

14:48.888 --> 14:51.140
and ignore grandma.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.475
I won't be ignoring her.

14:52.517 --> 14:53.768
I just don't think

14:52.517 --> 14:53.768
I'll get to her.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.353
Well, I've heard through

14:53.810 --> 14:55.353
the grapevine

14:55.395 --> 14:57.480
that Logan is so chatty,

14:55.395 --> 14:57.480
that once you get him started

14:57.522 --> 14:58.565
there's no shutting him up.

14:58.606 --> 14:59.774
Mom, forget it,

14:58.606 --> 14:59.774
if you want to go

14:59.816 --> 15:01.108
then you're gonna

14:59.816 --> 15:01.108
have to call grandma

15:01.150 --> 15:02.694
and tell her

15:01.150 --> 15:02.694
that you're going.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.571
I have to get up

15:02.736 --> 15:04.571
in two hours

15:04.612 --> 15:06.030
so if you don't mind,

15:04.612 --> 15:06.030
beat it.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.990
- But--

15:06.072 --> 15:07.990
- Hey. Sleeping.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.995
- Mom!

15:11.244 --> 15:12.995
- Sorry.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.252
[indistinct chatter]

15:21.880 --> 15:23.506
Can I help you?

15:23.548 --> 15:26.593
I was just trying to figure out

15:23.548 --> 15:26.593
if I'm in the right place.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.095
Were you hoping to be in

15:26.634 --> 15:29.095
some sort of newspaper office?

15:29.136 --> 15:32.682
Yes, I was. I'm Rory Gilmore.

15:29.136 --> 15:32.682
I'm an intern.

15:32.724 --> 15:36.394
Mitchum, Mr. Huntzberger

15:32.724 --> 15:36.394
hired me for nothing, of course.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.563
'Cause an intern makes nothing

15:36.436 --> 15:38.563
and they're happy to do it.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.774
- I'm new.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.774
- Here's a temporary ID.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.150
Sometime today,

15:40.815 --> 15:43.150
stop by and see Al Carson.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.111
He'll take a picture

15:43.192 --> 15:45.111
and get you a permanent one.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.321
I've never had

15:45.152 --> 15:47.321
a picture ID before.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.157
I'll take very good care of it.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.157
Is there a fine if you lose it?

15:50.199 --> 15:51.701
- No fine.

15:50.199 --> 15:51.701
- Well, I still won't lose it.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.202
- I promise.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.202
- Okay.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.413
You need to go talk to Harry,

15:53.244 --> 15:55.413
he deals with interns.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.749
Good morning, Eagle-Gazette.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.749
Please hold.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.125
Good morning, Eagle-Gazette.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.919
Where do I find Harry?

16:00.960 --> 16:04.380
I'm sorry. Mr. Wolowitz won't

16:00.960 --> 16:04.380
be in until this afternoon.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.930
Harry?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.517
- Harry?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.517
- Who called Harry?

16:16.559 --> 16:18.770
I did! I called Harry!

16:18.812 --> 16:22.315
Hi! I'm Rory Gilmore.

16:18.812 --> 16:22.315
I'm an intern.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.691
I have ID. And--

16:23.733 --> 16:25.443
Okay, this is basically

16:23.733 --> 16:25.443
the newsroom

16:25.485 --> 16:26.986
reporters, support staff.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.780
Over there is the composing room

16:27.027 --> 16:28.780
where we do paste-up.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.698
It's called paste-up because

16:28.822 --> 16:30.698
it used to be done with--

16:30.740 --> 16:32.450
- Scissors and paste.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.450
- Right, now we do it on a Mac.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.118
In that cabinet

16:32.492 --> 16:34.118
are all our back issues.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.913
'95 to present are on CD-ROM,

16:34.160 --> 16:36.913
earlier on microfiche.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.957
If you use the microfiche reader

16:36.955 --> 16:38.957
make sure you turn it off

16:38.998 --> 16:40.959
because the bulb is too hot

16:38.998 --> 16:40.959
and melts the stuff.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.544
- I sure wish I had a pencil.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.544
- This is Tom Firth's desk.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.672
He writes Firth Things First

16:43.586 --> 16:45.672
on the op-ed.

16:45.713 --> 16:49.258
That's Ed Rose.

16:45.713 --> 16:49.258
Circulation, advertising.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.385
In case of fire,

16:49.300 --> 16:51.385
stairs are that way.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.639
This is the kitchen.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.639
Coffee, stale donuts.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.265
lf you finish a pot,

16:54.681 --> 16:56.265
you make a new one.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.476
- 'Harry!'

16:56.307 --> 16:58.476
- Be right back.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.482
[instrumental music]

17:22.667 --> 17:23.918
(female #1)

17:22.667 --> 17:23.918
'Is he here again?'

17:23.960 --> 17:25.879
[indistinct chatter]

17:25.920 --> 17:28.548
- Huntzberger's here.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.548
- Ugh.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.883
- Huntzberger's here.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.883
- Where?

17:29.924 --> 17:31.551
I think he's one

17:29.924 --> 17:31.551
of those guys there.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.177
(Rory)

17:31.592 --> 17:33.177
'Yeah. In the middle,

17:31.592 --> 17:33.177
striped tie.'

17:33.219 --> 17:34.512
- You know Huntzberger?

17:33.219 --> 17:34.512
- Yes.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.305
Really? What's he like?

17:36.347 --> 17:39.266
Episcopalian,

17:36.347 --> 17:39.266
second of four children.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.978
Oldest boy and hates peas.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.938
This is Stan Mercer,

17:42.020 --> 17:43.938

17:43.980 --> 17:45.773
Les Cavanaugh,

17:43.980 --> 17:45.773

Stephanie Fitzsimmons,

17:45.815 --> 17:48.108
photo editor.

17:48.150 --> 17:53.155
And this is Patel Condraseskar.

17:48.150 --> 17:53.155
He's our resident computer whiz.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.658
Okay, lot of people,

17:53.197 --> 17:55.658
lot of names.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.869
And I promise

17:55.700 --> 17:57.869
I'll learn some of them.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.704
'We'll talk more about this

17:57.911 --> 17:59.704
at the general meeting'

17:59.746 --> 18:01.247
'but I want you people

17:59.746 --> 18:01.247
to understand'

18:01.288 --> 18:02.582
that the Huntzberger

18:01.288 --> 18:02.582
Publishing Group

18:02.623 --> 18:04.333
isn't going to change

18:02.623 --> 18:04.333
what you do.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.753
We're going to help you

18:04.375 --> 18:06.753
do what you do better.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.254
Alright, I wanna get

18:06.794 --> 18:08.254
all the department heads

18:08.295 --> 18:09.756
gathered in the conference room

18:08.295 --> 18:09.756
in ten minutes.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.716
Someone make some coffee.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.716
Rory?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.384
- Yes, sir?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.384
- You ready to shadow me?

18:13.426 --> 18:16.095
- Yes, sir.

18:13.426 --> 18:16.095
- Let's go.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.437
Did you see where they went?

18:33.237 --> 18:34.781
[clears throat]

18:34.822 --> 18:37.157
(Emily)

18:34.822 --> 18:37.157
'Hello?'

18:37.199 --> 18:38.952
'Hello?'

18:38.993 --> 18:41.704
'Who are you looking for?

18:38.993 --> 18:41.704
Did you dial the wrong number?'

18:41.746 --> 18:43.039
'You know, it's very rude

18:41.746 --> 18:43.039
to dial someone'

18:43.081 --> 18:44.498
'and just sit there

18:43.081 --> 18:44.498
on the phone'

18:44.540 --> 18:47.209
'without so much

18:44.540 --> 18:47.209
as a grunt or a moan.'

18:47.251 --> 18:49.336

18:47.251 --> 18:49.336
perverted phone calls go'

18:49.378 --> 18:51.213

18:52.465 --> 18:53.800
[sighs]

18:52.465 --> 18:53.800
Mom, hello.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.760
Lorelai? Is Rory okay?

18:55.802 --> 18:58.220
- 'Yeah, Rory's fine.'

18:55.802 --> 18:58.220
- Did somebody die? Who died?

18:58.262 --> 18:59.973
Nobody died, Mom.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.973
Everyone we know is fine.

19:00.014 --> 19:03.059
- Then why are you calling?

19:00.014 --> 19:03.059
- 'Well, I was wondering..'

19:03.101 --> 19:04.435
Yes?

19:04.477 --> 19:06.186
I just wanted to give you

19:04.477 --> 19:06.186
a heads-up

19:06.228 --> 19:10.149
that I was thinking I might

19:06.228 --> 19:10.149
come to Friday night dinner.

19:10.190 --> 19:12.986
- 'Mom, hello?'

19:10.190 --> 19:12.986
- When?

19:13.027 --> 19:14.779
Um, Friday night.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.073
- This Friday night?

19:14.821 --> 19:17.073
- Yes.

19:17.115 --> 19:19.158
The night Logan Huntzberger's

19:17.115 --> 19:19.158
coming to dinner?

19:19.199 --> 19:20.451
I guess, sure.

19:20.493 --> 19:23.663
Well, that's quite

19:20.493 --> 19:23.663
a coincidence, isn't it?

19:23.704 --> 19:25.581
That Logan's coming

19:23.704 --> 19:25.581
to dinner the night

19:25.623 --> 19:27.125
that you're suddenly free.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.709
'Well, I guess so.'

19:28.751 --> 19:30.294
Do you really think

19:28.751 --> 19:30.294
it's going to work this way?

19:30.336 --> 19:31.587
What way?

19:31.629 --> 19:33.089
That you just

19:31.629 --> 19:33.089
check the itinerary

19:33.131 --> 19:34.757
and pick which Friday night

19:33.131 --> 19:34.757
dinners you'll deign to come to

19:34.799 --> 19:36.216
and which ones you won't.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.427
I am not picking, it just

19:36.258 --> 19:38.427
happened that this Friday--

19:38.469 --> 19:40.763
That you wait till we have a

19:38.469 --> 19:40.763
guest like the Pope for dinner

19:40.805 --> 19:43.016
and then say, oh, yes,

19:40.805 --> 19:43.016
now it's worth my while

19:43.057 --> 19:45.143
to have dinner with my family,

19:43.057 --> 19:45.143
I get to meet the Pope.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.352
You're protestant, Mom.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.728
You do not

19:46.393 --> 19:47.728
get to cherry-pick

19:47.770 --> 19:48.855
which Friday night dinners

19:47.770 --> 19:48.855
you attend.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.606
It does not work that way.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.525
- It's never worked that way.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.525
- I wasn't cherry-picking.

19:52.566 --> 19:53.901
If you come to this dinner

19:53.943 --> 19:55.444
you come to them all,

19:53.943 --> 19:55.444
that's the deal.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.363
I'm really not sure

19:55.486 --> 19:57.363
that I'm free

19:57.404 --> 19:59.406
every Friday night,

19:57.404 --> 19:59.406
from now through eternity.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.325
If you come to this dinner,

19:59.448 --> 20:01.325
then you come to them all.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.036
That's the deal.

20:03.077 --> 20:06.288
As I said before, I'm just

20:03.077 --> 20:06.288
not sure about my schedule.

20:06.330 --> 20:07.790
Well, I'll tell you what.

20:07.832 --> 20:09.625
You go check

20:07.832 --> 20:09.625
that schedule of yours.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.251
If you show up

20:09.667 --> 20:11.251
on Friday night

20:11.293 --> 20:13.796
the night Logan Huntzberger

20:11.293 --> 20:13.796
happens to be here

20:13.838 --> 20:16.132
then I'll assume you've

20:13.838 --> 20:16.132
discovered that your Fridays

20:16.174 --> 20:18.551
at least for the foreseeable

20:16.174 --> 20:18.551
future, are free.

20:18.592 --> 20:19.927
Goodbye.

20:19.969 --> 20:21.137
[beeping]

20:22.972 --> 20:24.306
I'm saying

20:22.972 --> 20:24.306
it's these little costs

20:24.348 --> 20:26.350
that had you dropping your

20:24.348 --> 20:26.350
Hartford correspondent.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.102
How much are you paying

20:26.392 --> 20:28.102
for syndicated features?

20:28.144 --> 20:30.437
You run Dear Abby,

20:28.144 --> 20:30.437
and Ann Landers and Ask Vicki.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.314
How many different ways

20:30.479 --> 20:32.314
do the people in this community

20:32.356 --> 20:35.317
need to hear, honey, he ain't

20:32.356 --> 20:35.317
gonna change. Dump his ass?

20:35.359 --> 20:38.029
'I'd like to get that physical

20:35.359 --> 20:38.029
plant tour in before 5:00.'

20:38.071 --> 20:39.405
(Charlie)

20:38.071 --> 20:39.405
'Hang on, let me

20:38.071 --> 20:39.405
call Dan Gerson'

20:39.446 --> 20:41.407
'and see if they're

20:39.446 --> 20:41.407
ready for you.'

20:41.448 --> 20:43.201
Well, if we're

20:41.448 --> 20:43.201
in a holding pattern

20:43.242 --> 20:45.870
why don't you start getting

20:43.242 --> 20:45.870
into those circulation issues.

20:49.248 --> 20:53.544
Well, the ability to be able

20:49.248 --> 20:53.544
to run a four-minute mile

20:53.586 --> 20:55.671
would come in pretty handy

20:53.586 --> 20:55.671
right about now, huh?

20:55.713 --> 20:58.424
- Sorry?

20:55.713 --> 20:58.424
- A four-minute mile?

20:58.465 --> 21:00.134
I don't follow.

21:00.176 --> 21:03.679
At Yale, track and field,

21:00.176 --> 21:03.679
you ran a four-minute mile.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.139
Right.

21:05.181 --> 21:08.726
That's fast.

21:05.181 --> 21:08.726
Four-minute mile.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.977
Dan's gonna need

21:08.768 --> 21:09.977
another ten.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.478
Why don't I take you

21:10.019 --> 21:11.478
into Ron Stone's.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.814
- We'll talk some advertising.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.814
- Let's do it.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.989
If you're looking for

21:20.029 --> 21:21.989
Huntzberger, he went in there.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.616
Oh. Thanks.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.002
[telephone ringing]

21:36.837 --> 21:38.089
- Hello?

21:36.837 --> 21:38.089
- 'Help, help, help.'

21:38.131 --> 21:39.840
What's the matter, Ace?

21:39.882 --> 21:41.968
Nothing! I've just won

21:39.882 --> 21:41.968
the Spaz of the Year award.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.386
I believe it'll be on the front

21:42.009 --> 21:44.386
page of the Gazette tomorrow.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.930
'I'm sure it's not that bad.'

21:45.972 --> 21:47.265
I don't know what

21:45.972 --> 21:47.265
I'm supposed to do.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.016
I don't know where anybody is.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.894
I can't walk in these shoes.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.894
I got a run in my pantyhose.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.354
- I ran into a file cabinet.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.354
- Slow down.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.274
'I didn't even know if I was

21:54.396 --> 21:56.274
supposed to go to lunch'

21:56.315 --> 21:57.775
when everybody went to lunch

21:57.817 --> 21:59.944
so I just stood in the break

21:57.817 --> 21:59.944
room for, like, 45 minutes.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.487
And then I ate an Altoid.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.656
It's the first day.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.656
It'll get better.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.116
'Your father must think

22:03.697 --> 22:05.116
I'm an idiot.'

22:05.158 --> 22:07.160
- I'm sure he doesn't.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.160
- I need some help.

22:07.201 --> 22:09.078
I need something

22:07.201 --> 22:09.078
to say to him other than

22:09.120 --> 22:10.621
"Yes, the bleeding stopped.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.621
Thanks."

22:10.663 --> 22:13.332
- I think that's pretty good.

22:10.663 --> 22:13.332
- Logan, please.

22:13.373 --> 22:16.252
Give me something. Something

22:13.373 --> 22:16.252
I can use to connect with him.

22:16.294 --> 22:18.796
- I don't know.

22:16.294 --> 22:18.796
- 'You do know.'

22:18.838 --> 22:21.132
'This is important

22:18.838 --> 22:21.132
to me, Logan. Please?'

22:21.174 --> 22:23.009
[sighs]

22:23.050 --> 22:25.136
He likes jazz, but not when it

22:23.050 --> 22:25.136
gets too experimental

22:25.178 --> 22:26.804
he hates when they quote

22:25.178 --> 22:26.804
"My Favorite Things."

22:26.846 --> 22:28.014
- What?

22:26.846 --> 22:28.014
- '"My Favorite Things."'

22:28.055 --> 22:29.431
'From "The Sound of Music."'

22:30.432 --> 22:32.476
Okay. Good. Go on.

22:32.518 --> 22:35.188
He lets people go at 7

22:35.229 --> 22:37.606
but he keeps going

22:35.229 --> 22:37.606
till 8:30 or 9.

22:37.648 --> 22:40.276
And he notices

22:37.648 --> 22:40.276
the people who stay.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.987
He hates double talk,

22:40.318 --> 22:42.987
but he's really good at it.

22:43.029 --> 22:45.739
'And, uh, he has

22:43.029 --> 22:45.739
high blood pressure'

22:45.781 --> 22:47.950
'so he switches

22:45.781 --> 22:47.950
to decaf after 4.'

22:47.992 --> 22:49.910
That's good.

22:47.992 --> 22:49.910
That's almost something.

22:49.952 --> 22:52.454
'Don't worry, Ace,

22:49.952 --> 22:52.454
I'm sure you're doing fine.'

22:52.496 --> 22:54.832
I just don't want your father

22:52.496 --> 22:54.832
to be disappointed in me.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.959
Rory...in order for my dad

22:57.001 --> 22:58.585
to be truly disappointed in you

22:58.627 --> 23:00.004
your name would

22:58.627 --> 23:00.004
have to be Logan.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.048
- 'I'm sure that's not true.'

23:00.046 --> 23:02.048
- Uh-huh.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.091
- Thanks, Logan.

23:02.089 --> 23:04.091
- 'Go get 'em, Ace.'

23:11.307 --> 23:13.059
Oh, my God, this smells good.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.059
What is this?

23:13.100 --> 23:15.393
It's nothing. Just some

23:13.100 --> 23:15.393
soft-shelled crab amandine

23:15.435 --> 23:17.271
on a bed of wild rice.

23:17.313 --> 23:19.439
Okay. There's no sentence

23:17.313 --> 23:19.439
in the English language

23:19.481 --> 23:22.943
that begins, it's nothing,

23:19.481 --> 23:22.943
and contains the word amandine.

23:22.985 --> 23:25.029
Happy.

23:25.071 --> 23:27.948
[cellphone ringing]

23:25.071 --> 23:27.948
Oh, my God, your girlfriend

23:25.071 --> 23:27.948
is so important.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.075
Hello?

23:29.116 --> 23:30.910
- 'Lorelai?'

23:29.116 --> 23:30.910
- Hey, dad.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.079
'Something very remarkable

23:30.951 --> 23:33.079
happened today.'

23:33.120 --> 23:35.081
I got a call from someone

23:33.120 --> 23:35.081
wanting to know

23:35.122 --> 23:36.999
if I was

23:35.122 --> 23:36.999
Lorelai Gilmore's father.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.458
'Really?'

23:38.500 --> 23:40.336
Outside the context

23:38.500 --> 23:40.336
of trouble at school

23:40.378 --> 23:42.171
that's the first time

23:40.378 --> 23:42.171
someone has ever asked me that.

23:42.213 --> 23:44.006
And why did someone

23:42.213 --> 23:44.006
ask you that?

23:44.048 --> 23:46.759
Well, one of our clients

23:44.048 --> 23:46.759
is the Durham Group.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.844
- 'You know them?'

23:46.800 --> 23:48.844
- They own hotels?

23:48.886 --> 23:50.596
'They own boutique inns.'

23:50.637 --> 23:52.223
The CEO, Mike Armstrong

23:52.265 --> 23:54.767
is good friends

23:52.265 --> 23:54.767
with Twee Silverman

23:54.808 --> 23:57.144
who is the publisher

23:54.808 --> 23:57.144
of American Travel.

23:57.186 --> 23:58.938
It seems there's quite

23:57.186 --> 23:58.938
an article coming out

23:58.979 --> 24:02.358
about you and Sookie and your

23:58.979 --> 24:02.358
success at the Dragonfly.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.236
'According to Twee, it's the

24:02.400 --> 24:05.236
cover story of the May issue.'

24:05.278 --> 24:06.779
The article's coming out.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.781
Dad, did your guy

24:06.820 --> 24:08.781
happen to talk about

24:08.822 --> 24:09.823
what's in the article?

24:09.865 --> 24:11.491
I don't think he'd read it.

24:11.533 --> 24:13.160
Twee clued him in

24:11.533 --> 24:13.160
because she knows

24:13.202 --> 24:15.371
he's always

24:13.202 --> 24:15.371
looking for up-and-comers.

24:15.413 --> 24:17.455
Apparently,

24:15.413 --> 24:17.455
you are an up-and-comer.

24:17.497 --> 24:18.498
I'm an up-and-comer.

24:18.540 --> 24:20.209
'Long story short, Lorelai'

24:20.251 --> 24:23.045
Mike Armstrong would like

24:20.251 --> 24:23.045
to take a meeting with you.

24:23.087 --> 24:25.131
- Why?

24:23.087 --> 24:25.131
- He's in the inn business.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.966
'I assume he wants to offer you

24:25.172 --> 24:26.966
some sort of job.'

24:27.007 --> 24:28.342
Dad, I have a job.

24:28.384 --> 24:29.927
Apparently, you can read

24:28.384 --> 24:29.927
all about it in May.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.469
He asked if you traveled much.

24:31.511 --> 24:33.055
'He wants to know

24:31.511 --> 24:33.055
where I go on vacation?'

24:33.097 --> 24:34.932
He was referring

24:33.097 --> 24:34.932
to business travel.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.934
Perhaps the position

24:34.974 --> 24:36.934
involves travel.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.644
Do you travel?

24:36.976 --> 24:38.644
I wasn't really sure.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.562
Well, the liquor store's

24:38.685 --> 24:40.562
a little further out

24:40.604 --> 24:42.231
- than I'd like, but--

24:40.604 --> 24:42.231
- 'Lorelai.'

24:42.273 --> 24:45.025
- Yeah, dad, I travel sometimes.

24:42.273 --> 24:45.025
- Well, good.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.194
I'll have my secretary fax

24:45.067 --> 24:47.194
the contact information

24:47.236 --> 24:48.528
to your home fax tonight

24:48.570 --> 24:49.613
and you can call him

24:48.570 --> 24:49.613
in the morning.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.531
Dad, I don't have a home fax.

24:51.573 --> 24:53.242
I don't see how you do

24:51.573 --> 24:53.242
business on this level

24:53.284 --> 24:54.534
and not have a home fax.

24:54.576 --> 24:56.536
We're all confounded

24:54.576 --> 24:56.536
by that, yes.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.289
Call my office

24:56.578 --> 24:58.289
in the morning.

24:58.331 --> 25:01.417
I'm...quite proud of you,

24:58.331 --> 25:01.417
Lorelai.

25:01.459 --> 25:04.003
Thanks, dad.

25:04.044 --> 25:05.503
They're running the article.

25:05.545 --> 25:06.797
Good. I'm glad they're

25:05.545 --> 25:06.797
running the article.

25:06.839 --> 25:07.840
I never liked

25:06.839 --> 25:07.840
that you pulled it.

25:07.881 --> 25:09.258
Yes, well, if you recall

25:09.300 --> 25:10.968
I pulled it only

25:09.300 --> 25:10.968
after I suggested

25:11.010 --> 25:12.136
my mother might've been

25:11.010 --> 25:12.136
personally responsible

25:12.178 --> 25:13.595
for global warming.

25:13.637 --> 25:15.139
Are you seriously worried

25:13.637 --> 25:15.139
that things might get worse

25:15.181 --> 25:16.390
between you and your mother?

25:16.432 --> 25:17.724
Good point.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.019
So what's all this stuff

25:17.766 --> 25:20.019
about you traveling?

25:20.060 --> 25:22.396
Some guy my dad knows

25:20.060 --> 25:22.396
wants to offer me a job.

25:22.438 --> 25:23.563
And apparently

25:22.438 --> 25:23.563
there's travel involved.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.316
- You have a job.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.316
- I know.

25:25.358 --> 25:27.067
But companies like this would

25:25.358 --> 25:27.067
probably wanna buy the inn

25:27.109 --> 25:28.819
and I don't know,

25:27.109 --> 25:28.819
keep me on to manage it

25:28.861 --> 25:30.279
or send me out

25:28.861 --> 25:30.279
as a consultant.

25:30.321 --> 25:31.780
Buy the inn?

25:30.321 --> 25:31.780
You just opened the inn.

25:31.822 --> 25:33.073
- You don't wanna sell the inn.

25:31.822 --> 25:33.073
- I know.

25:33.115 --> 25:34.658
I mean,

25:33.115 --> 25:34.658
who are these people

25:34.700 --> 25:36.285
coming in from out of the blue

25:34.700 --> 25:36.285
with this stuff?

25:36.327 --> 25:37.870
I don't know. Just some guy

25:36.327 --> 25:37.870
who called my dad

25:37.911 --> 25:39.621
and wants to meet me.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.999
Well, this is crazy. You don't

25:39.663 --> 25:41.999
wanna meet with this guy.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.210
Luke, I'm not interested,

25:42.041 --> 25:44.210
so it doesn't matter.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.669
I have no intention

25:44.251 --> 25:45.669
of meeting with this guy.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.130
- I'm happy with what I've got.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.130
- Good.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.303
You know what?

25:54.345 --> 25:55.929
You should meet

25:54.345 --> 25:55.929
with this guy.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.931
My daughter, my sister,

25:55.971 --> 25:57.931
my daughter, my sister.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.475
I'm serious. Even if

25:57.973 --> 25:59.475
you're not interested.

25:59.517 --> 26:01.685
I mean, it's good

25:59.517 --> 26:01.685
people are talking about you

26:01.727 --> 26:04.980
and your business...

26:01.727 --> 26:04.980
just...take the meeting.

26:05.022 --> 26:07.358
It's contacts.

26:05.022 --> 26:07.358
It's networking. Right?

26:07.400 --> 26:08.859
That's the right word,

26:07.400 --> 26:08.859
networking?

26:08.901 --> 26:10.694
- I think.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.694
- Well, then you should network.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.488
Alright. Well,

26:10.736 --> 26:12.488
I'll think about it.

26:12.530 --> 26:14.240
Good.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.657
Good.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.162
- Beatrice?

26:18.744 --> 26:20.162
- Yes, ma'am.

26:20.204 --> 26:22.164
- Do you know what these are?

26:20.204 --> 26:22.164
- Lilies.

26:22.206 --> 26:24.208
Fragrant lilies. Would you

26:22.206 --> 26:24.208
like to eat dinner

26:24.250 --> 26:25.543
with fragrant lilies

26:24.250 --> 26:25.543
in the room?

26:25.583 --> 26:27.336
- Yes.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.336
- Well, then you're insane!

26:27.378 --> 26:29.255
I don't know

26:27.378 --> 26:29.255
how you think my guests

26:29.296 --> 26:30.797
are supposed to enjoy

26:29.296 --> 26:30.797
their dinner

26:30.839 --> 26:33.675
with this floral reek

26:30.839 --> 26:33.675
wafting up their noses!

26:33.717 --> 26:35.844
Move them to the living room

26:33.717 --> 26:35.844
and bring the peonies in here.

26:35.886 --> 26:39.098
- Yes, ma'am. Sorry, ma'am.

26:35.886 --> 26:39.098
- Everything looks lovely.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.934
- Does it?

26:39.139 --> 26:41.934
- Yes, and so do you.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.227
What's on the dinner menu

26:41.975 --> 26:43.227
tonight?

26:43.269 --> 26:44.602
Roast beef.

26:44.644 --> 26:47.147
Oh, I hope Logan's not

26:44.644 --> 26:47.147
some kind of vegetarian.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.567
No, his grandfather owned

26:47.189 --> 26:49.567
10,000 head of cattle.

26:49.607 --> 26:51.777
I sincerely doubt it.

26:51.818 --> 26:53.362
You know, I've

26:51.818 --> 26:53.362
just been thinking.

26:53.404 --> 26:55.822
The Huntzbergers will

26:53.404 --> 26:55.822
all be transferring down

26:55.864 --> 26:57.241
to Martha's Vineyard soon.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.159
Mid-June.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.159
Every year like clockwork.

26:59.201 --> 27:01.120
I'm sure Logan's there

26:59.201 --> 27:01.120
for some of that.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.705
They have six acres there.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.705
That's quite a spread.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.541
They've held their share of

27:03.747 --> 27:05.541
functions down there, too.

27:05.583 --> 27:07.667
Graduations, parties, weddings.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.753
- Maybe it's time for us, Emily.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.753
- Time for what?

27:09.795 --> 27:11.964
Time to acquire

27:09.795 --> 27:11.964
our own acreage.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.049
A compound

27:12.005 --> 27:14.049
for the extended family.

27:14.091 --> 27:16.760
- A place on Cape Cod!

27:14.091 --> 27:16.760
- Our own Kennebunkport.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.720
Get it all ready

27:16.802 --> 27:18.720
for the next generation.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.389
The Cape's as good

27:18.762 --> 27:20.389
as the Vineyard for a wedding.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.682
- Some would say better.

27:20.431 --> 27:22.682
- Sandier beaches, too.

27:22.724 --> 27:24.726
Children love sandy beaches.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.644
Just love running

27:24.768 --> 27:26.644
and playing on them.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.105
[doorbell rings]

27:28.147 --> 27:30.316
Oh, damn. I forgot to

27:28.147 --> 27:30.316
fill the ice bucket.

27:30.357 --> 27:33.110
Go get it.

27:30.357 --> 27:33.110
I'll get the door.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.945
Richard?

27:34.987 --> 27:38.407
Picture his blond hair and her

27:34.987 --> 27:38.407
blue eyes on a little baby.

27:38.449 --> 27:40.493
Incomparable.

27:46.873 --> 27:49.293
- Hi, mom.

27:46.873 --> 27:49.293
- Oh. Come in.

27:49.335 --> 27:50.294
Thanks.

27:52.463 --> 27:56.175
Beatrice,

27:52.463 --> 27:56.175
take my daughter's coat.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.593
Thank you.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.394
What are you doing here?

28:07.436 --> 28:09.396
I don't know.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.396
I just followed you.

28:09.438 --> 28:11.273
Richard, come out here

28:09.438 --> 28:11.273
and sit with Lorelai.

28:11.315 --> 28:13.150
- 'Coming.'

28:11.315 --> 28:13.150
- Mom, it's okay.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.318
I can sit by myself.

28:14.360 --> 28:15.569
You need me

28:14.360 --> 28:15.569
to sit with Lorelai?

28:15.611 --> 28:16.736
I'm fine. I swear.

28:16.778 --> 28:17.821
I have been sitting

28:16.778 --> 28:17.821
without any help

28:17.863 --> 28:19.031
since I was two and a half.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.866
No, that's alright.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.866
I don't mind. Come along.

28:23.285 --> 28:25.245
Please, sit. Sit.

28:25.287 --> 28:27.039
There's a lot of pressure

28:25.287 --> 28:27.039
to do it right now.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.415
So, did you ring

28:27.080 --> 28:28.415
Mike Armstrong?

28:28.457 --> 28:30.668
I did. We have a meeting

28:28.457 --> 28:30.668
set up for tomorrow.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.378
Oh, Good, good.

28:30.708 --> 28:32.378
I'm glad.

28:32.419 --> 28:33.795
Mike is very big

28:32.419 --> 28:33.795
in that business.

28:33.837 --> 28:35.381
I think you'll find him

28:33.837 --> 28:35.381
a valuable--

28:35.422 --> 28:37.966
(Emily)

28:35.422 --> 28:37.966
'Richard? I need help in here.'

28:38.008 --> 28:39.843
I'm sitting

28:38.008 --> 28:39.843
with Lorelai, Emily.

28:39.885 --> 28:41.303
Dad, really, it's okay.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.847
I promise not to stick

28:41.345 --> 28:43.847
my finger in any sockets.

28:43.889 --> 28:46.933
Well, alright.

28:43.889 --> 28:46.933
Here I come.

28:49.186 --> 28:51.188
(Richard)

28:49.186 --> 28:51.188
'What sort of help

28:49.186 --> 28:51.188
do you need, my dear?'

28:55.651 --> 28:57.486
You know, you're not

28:55.651 --> 28:57.486
obligated to be polite

28:57.528 --> 28:59.988
until we're actually inside

28:57.528 --> 28:59.988
my grandparents' house.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.948
Good. Allow me to use these

29:00.030 --> 29:01.948
brief moments of time

29:01.990 --> 29:03.367
to make some disgusting noises

29:01.990 --> 29:03.367
with my armpits.

29:03.409 --> 29:04.910
Oh, would you?

29:04.951 --> 29:07.287
So, this is going to be

29:04.951 --> 29:07.287
quick and painless.

29:07.329 --> 29:08.788
Believe me,

29:07.329 --> 29:08.788
my grandparents like you

29:08.830 --> 29:10.207
better than they like

29:08.830 --> 29:10.207
Ronald Reagan.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.251
- Wow. High praise.

29:10.249 --> 29:12.251
- What are those?

29:12.292 --> 29:14.587
Hostess gifts. Never a bad idea

29:12.292 --> 29:14.587
to bring hostess gifts.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.714
- Well-played, Huntzberger.

29:14.628 --> 29:16.714
- So what about your mom?

29:16.755 --> 29:18.840
- Is she gonna be cool?

29:16.755 --> 29:18.840
- Of course she'll be cool.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.885
She's the essence of cool.

29:18.882 --> 29:21.885
Cool is her street name.

29:21.927 --> 29:24.012
She's got it monogrammed

29:21.927 --> 29:24.012
on her towels and everything.

29:24.054 --> 29:25.889
Well, if she's got it

29:24.054 --> 29:25.889
monogrammed on her towels

29:25.931 --> 29:27.015
there's nothing to worry about.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.308
What'd you bring, anyway?

29:28.350 --> 29:30.185
Cigars for Richard,

29:28.350 --> 29:30.185
chocolates for Emily

29:30.227 --> 29:33.230
and Mrs. Eleanor Shubic's

29:30.227 --> 29:33.230
silver lighter.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.232
Huh? What's that for?

29:35.274 --> 29:37.859
- Rory, Logan, welcome.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.859
- Come in. Come in.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.612
- Hi, grandma.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.612
- Hello.

29:39.653 --> 29:40.862
And our guest of honor.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.114
<i>L'invite d'honneur.</i>

29:42.155 --> 29:43.574
How are you, Richard? Emily?

29:43.616 --> 29:45.909
- Wonderful now.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.909
- Yes, wonderful.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.620
Oh, look at you two,

29:45.951 --> 29:47.620
you're just perfect.

29:47.661 --> 29:49.204
- Aren't they perfect, Richard?

29:47.661 --> 29:49.204
- Perfect.

29:49.246 --> 29:51.582
- We're not perfect.

29:49.246 --> 29:51.582
- Nonsense. You're perfect.

29:51.624 --> 29:53.500
No, she's right. I've got split

29:51.624 --> 29:53.500
ends like you wouldn't believe.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.419
[laughs]

29:53.542 --> 29:55.419
And a sense of humor.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.879
Emily, these are for you.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.879
A small token of my gratitude.

29:57.921 --> 30:00.840
Vunderschen chocolates,

29:57.921 --> 30:00.840
I absolutely adore these!

30:00.882 --> 30:02.342
I picked them up last time

30:00.882 --> 30:02.342
I was in Switzerland.

30:02.384 --> 30:03.843
Well, aren't you clever?

30:03.885 --> 30:05.304
And here's a little something

30:03.885 --> 30:05.304
for you, sir.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.722
<i>Romeo y Julietas.</i>

30:06.764 --> 30:08.890
You are a good man,

30:06.764 --> 30:08.890
Logan Huntzberger.

30:08.932 --> 30:12.352
Come on, let's all go

30:08.932 --> 30:12.352
in the living room, shall we?

30:12.394 --> 30:14.854
I just adore this jacket

30:12.394 --> 30:14.854
you're wearing.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.189
Isn't this a fine jacket,

30:14.896 --> 30:16.189
Richard?

30:16.231 --> 30:17.899
I like how

30:16.231 --> 30:17.899
the lapels are cut.

30:17.941 --> 30:19.234
Aren't those nice lapels,

30:17.941 --> 30:19.234
Rory?

30:19.276 --> 30:21.487
Sure, grandpa,

30:19.276 --> 30:21.487
his lapels look great.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.697
Most modern tailors

30:21.528 --> 30:23.697
cut lapels too low.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.324
It's so sloppy,

30:23.739 --> 30:25.324
having one's lapels

30:25.365 --> 30:26.825
'hang down around the chest'

30:26.866 --> 30:28.702
'like a basset hound's ears

30:26.866 --> 30:28.702
or something.'

30:28.744 --> 30:30.829
- But those are excellent.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.829
- They really are.

30:30.870 --> 30:33.123
- Hi,mom.

30:30.870 --> 30:33.123
- Hey, how am I sitting?

30:33.165 --> 30:34.708
Great.

30:33.165 --> 30:34.708
Mom, you remember--

30:34.750 --> 30:36.669
Logan, this is Rory's mother,

30:34.750 --> 30:36.669
Lorelai.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.504
Lorelai,

30:36.710 --> 30:38.504
this is Logan Huntzberger.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.922
Yes, we've met, actually.

30:38.545 --> 30:40.922
Nice to see you again.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.008
- Nice to see you.

30:40.964 --> 30:43.008
- Come on, sit, sit, sit.

30:43.049 --> 30:45.552
Let's get drink orders.

30:45.594 --> 30:48.347
- Logan, what would you like?

30:45.594 --> 30:48.347
- Macallan neat, if you have it.

30:48.388 --> 30:51.016
I adore a man

30:48.388 --> 30:51.016
who drinks his scotch neat.

30:51.057 --> 30:52.601
That is a fine drink indeed.

30:52.643 --> 30:54.645
- Rory?

30:52.643 --> 30:54.645
- Just club soda.

30:54.687 --> 30:57.230
- So demure. Isn't she demure?

30:54.687 --> 30:57.230
- The demurest.

30:57.272 --> 30:59.274
One club soda.

30:59.316 --> 31:01.193
And your usual, Lorelai?

30:59.316 --> 31:01.193
A sidecar?

31:01.234 --> 31:03.278
- Sidecar? No.

31:01.234 --> 31:03.278
- Isn't that your drink?

31:03.320 --> 31:06.365
No, my drink is a martini.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.365
It's always been a martini.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.783
- Really?

31:06.406 --> 31:07.783
- Yes.

31:07.825 --> 31:09.743
Pretty much every one

31:07.825 --> 31:09.743
of the other 8,000 times

31:09.785 --> 31:10.661
I've had a drink here

31:10.703 --> 31:11.953
it's been a martini.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.164
I would have sworn

31:11.995 --> 31:14.164
you were a sidecar girl.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.915
Not even sure

31:14.206 --> 31:15.915
what's in a sidecar, Mom.

31:15.957 --> 31:18.836
Well, Richard, apparently,

31:15.957 --> 31:18.836
Lorelai would like a martini.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.212
Can do.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.797
I just can't get over

31:20.253 --> 31:21.797
those lapels.

31:21.839 --> 31:24.924
Grandma and grandpa are

31:21.839 --> 31:24.924
very taken with Logan's lapels.

31:24.966 --> 31:26.343
They look fine to me.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.470
You'll have to

31:26.385 --> 31:28.470
excuse Lorelai, Logan.

31:28.512 --> 31:31.181
It takes a certain eye to be

31:28.512 --> 31:31.181
aware of this kind of thing.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.684
One scotch, neat,

31:31.223 --> 31:33.684
and a club soda.

31:33.726 --> 31:35.018
- Thank you.

31:33.726 --> 31:35.018
- Thanks, grandpa.

31:35.060 --> 31:36.936
And one martini.

31:36.978 --> 31:39.439
- That's with a twist, Lorelai?

31:36.978 --> 31:39.439
- Nope. An olive.

31:39.481 --> 31:43.318
- In a vodka martini?

31:39.481 --> 31:43.318
- Not vodka, mom, gin.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.529
It's always been gin.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.529
Gin martini.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.573
- Really?

31:45.571 --> 31:47.573
- 'Yes, always.'

31:47.614 --> 31:49.366
I don't remember that at all.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.618
Uh, so. Logan. Where exactly

31:49.408 --> 31:51.618
do you live at Yale?

31:51.660 --> 31:53.662
- Are you in Rory's building?

31:51.660 --> 31:53.662
- No, I'm at Berkeley.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.247
- Is that far from Rory?

31:53.704 --> 31:55.247
- No.

31:55.288 --> 31:56.790
I'd say it's about

31:55.288 --> 31:56.790
90 Kropogs or so.

31:56.832 --> 32:00.168
Kropogs!

31:56.832 --> 32:00.168
Did someone say Kropogs?

32:00.210 --> 32:02.629
Kropogs.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.629
Now, that is clever.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.172
[laughing]

32:04.214 --> 32:05.924
So fill me in here.

32:04.214 --> 32:05.924
What's a Kropog?

32:05.965 --> 32:08.343
Years ago, someone at Yale

32:05.965 --> 32:08.343
started measuring things

32:08.385 --> 32:10.136
based on the height

32:08.385 --> 32:10.136
of a kid named Kropog.

32:10.178 --> 32:12.972
I can't believe that today's

32:10.178 --> 32:12.972
Elis are still using Kropogs.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.850
Now, that is really something.

32:14.892 --> 32:19.104
Maxwell T. Kropog

32:14.892 --> 32:19.104
was his name, class of '44.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.022
Oh, Lorelai, I'm sorry.

32:19.145 --> 32:21.022
I forgot your drink.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.649
'I made it and everything.'

32:22.691 --> 32:24.693
- Well, you remembered now.

32:22.691 --> 32:24.693
- No, Richard, stay.

32:24.735 --> 32:26.319
I'll get it.

32:26.361 --> 32:28.655
I'm glad to hear

32:26.361 --> 32:28.655
that Kropog

32:28.697 --> 32:30.031
is still part

32:28.697 --> 32:30.031
of the Yale vernacular.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.658
'Tradition is so important.'

32:31.700 --> 32:34.077
Why don't we talk about

32:31.700 --> 32:34.077
something other than Yale?

32:34.119 --> 32:36.413
Nonsense. There's nothing

32:34.119 --> 32:36.413
better to talk about than Yale.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.373
Because Yale men

32:36.455 --> 32:38.373
are the greatest.

32:38.415 --> 32:41.501
I dated a few Princeton men

32:38.415 --> 32:41.501
and a Harvard man back in my day

32:41.543 --> 32:43.253
and they had nothing

32:41.543 --> 32:43.253
on Yale men.

32:43.295 --> 32:47.800
- They'd better not.

32:43.295 --> 32:47.800
- Here you go, Lorelai.

32:47.841 --> 32:50.636
- Mom, there's an onion in here.

32:47.841 --> 32:50.636
- Is that not what you wanted?

32:50.677 --> 32:53.305
- Olive. I said, olive.

32:50.677 --> 32:53.305
- Well, I heard onion.

32:53.346 --> 32:56.809
- I said, olive.

32:53.346 --> 32:56.809
- Let me get you an olive.

32:59.561 --> 33:01.146
(Emily)

32:59.561 --> 33:01.146
'And the rackets

32:59.561 --> 33:01.146
have changed, too.'

33:01.187 --> 33:02.731
'Honestly, people at the club

33:01.187 --> 33:02.731
must've thought'

33:02.773 --> 33:04.691
'I was there to play badminton

33:02.773 --> 33:04.691
when I showed up'

33:04.733 --> 33:05.943
with my old wooden thing.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.486
Oh, you have to get

33:05.984 --> 33:07.486
a new racket, Emily.

33:07.527 --> 33:09.112
The materials available today

33:07.527 --> 33:09.112
make all the difference.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.197
- I told her the same thing.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.197
- I know this guy.

33:11.239 --> 33:12.532
He's one of

33:11.239 --> 33:12.532
the top manufacturers

33:12.574 --> 33:14.242
of ceramic rackets.

33:12.574 --> 33:14.242
Pete Sampras loves him.

33:14.284 --> 33:15.702
I could totally set you up.

33:15.744 --> 33:17.871
Did you hear that, Richard?

33:15.744 --> 33:17.871
Logan can set me up.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.373
- How about that?

33:17.913 --> 33:20.373
- Dinner is ready, Mrs. Gilmore.

33:20.415 --> 33:21.708
Well, shall we?

33:21.750 --> 33:22.793
I'm just gonna pop

33:21.750 --> 33:22.793
into the kitchen

33:22.835 --> 33:24.252
to check on a thing or two.

33:24.294 --> 33:25.295
Richard, will you come

33:24.294 --> 33:25.295
carve the roast?

33:25.337 --> 33:26.755
Certainly.

33:26.797 --> 33:28.131
Is there gonna be alcohol

33:26.797 --> 33:28.131
at dinner, mom?

33:28.173 --> 33:29.842
- What?

33:28.173 --> 33:29.842
- You know, booze.

33:29.883 --> 33:32.218
'Cause I haven't been able

33:29.883 --> 33:32.218
to get even a Kropog of gin

33:32.260 --> 33:33.887
since that first drink.

33:33.929 --> 33:36.974
A Kropog is a unit of distance,

33:33.929 --> 33:36.974
Lorelai, not volume.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.475
And there'll be wine

33:37.015 --> 33:38.475
with the meal.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.560
There's always wine

33:38.517 --> 33:40.560
with the meal, Lorelai.

33:40.602 --> 33:44.898
Honestly, you're acting

33:40.602 --> 33:44.898
as if you've never been here.

33:44.940 --> 33:47.901
Sorry. Just wasn't sure.

33:52.739 --> 33:54.992
Roast. Sounds good.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.910
It does.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.620
Yeah.

33:58.662 --> 34:01.122
Who doesn't like a good roast?

34:07.504 --> 34:08.922
What are you doing?

34:08.964 --> 34:10.716
A little Life and

34:08.964 --> 34:10.716
Death Brigade business.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.342
'Every time we're

34:10.757 --> 34:12.342
in a rich person's house'

34:12.384 --> 34:14.302
I take a knick-knack. Then

34:12.384 --> 34:14.302
I leave the knick-knack

34:14.344 --> 34:16.054
I took from the last

34:14.344 --> 34:16.054
rich person's house.

34:16.095 --> 34:17.931
I've been doing this up and down

34:16.095 --> 34:17.931
the Eastern seaboard for years.

34:17.973 --> 34:20.225
- Logan, no.

34:17.973 --> 34:20.225
- Trust me. They never notice.

34:20.266 --> 34:23.186
- You're crazy.

34:20.266 --> 34:23.186
- It's fun to be crazy.

34:25.522 --> 34:28.107
Grandma probably wants us here.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.861
Alright, the salads will be

34:28.149 --> 34:30.861
out in just a moment.

34:30.903 --> 34:32.362
Everybody sit.

34:34.155 --> 34:36.491
Wait a minute.

34:36.533 --> 34:39.828
- What's wrong, Emily?

34:36.533 --> 34:39.828
- Well, I don't know.

34:39.870 --> 34:42.915
Wait. My antique sewing box

34:39.870 --> 34:42.915
is missing.

34:42.956 --> 34:45.166
- Well, that can't be.

34:42.956 --> 34:45.166
- It is! It's gone!

34:45.208 --> 34:46.543
Was it here during drinks?

34:46.585 --> 34:48.253
I can't say that I noticed.

34:48.294 --> 34:50.213
You, hovering there.

34:48.294 --> 34:50.213
What do you know about this?

34:50.255 --> 34:51.882
- 'Ma'am?'

34:50.255 --> 34:51.882
- My antique sewing box.

34:51.924 --> 34:53.216
'Did you move it somewhere?'

34:53.258 --> 34:54.927
- No.

34:53.258 --> 34:54.927
- 'And yet it's not here.'

34:54.968 --> 34:57.596
Do you have any explanation as

34:54.968 --> 34:57.596
to why it's not here, Beatrice?

34:57.637 --> 34:59.056
I'm sure it's just

34:57.637 --> 34:59.056
a mix-up, mom.

34:59.097 --> 35:03.393
And...what's this?

34:59.097 --> 35:03.393
What's this lighter?

35:03.435 --> 35:05.437
Richard, is this

35:03.435 --> 35:05.437
from the pool house?

35:05.478 --> 35:07.940
I don't recognize it,

35:05.478 --> 35:07.940
but you never know.

35:07.981 --> 35:10.025
One of the guys might have

35:07.981 --> 35:10.025
left it after a poker game.

35:10.067 --> 35:12.193
(Emily)

35:10.067 --> 35:12.193
'Well, Beatrice,

35:10.067 --> 35:12.193
I don't know what to say.'

35:12.235 --> 35:14.153
'I almost feel like I should

35:12.235 --> 35:14.153
go through the whole house'

35:14.195 --> 35:15.488
'and make sure nothing else

35:14.195 --> 35:15.488
has been misplaced.'

35:15.530 --> 35:17.240
Mom, I found it.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.367
'However, we have company,

35:17.282 --> 35:19.367
and I don't want to be rude.'

35:19.409 --> 35:21.036
'Let's just leave it

35:19.409 --> 35:21.036
for later'

35:21.078 --> 35:23.747
'and you and I will have

35:21.078 --> 35:23.747
a very serious discussion.'

35:23.789 --> 35:25.707
- Mom, I found it!

35:23.789 --> 35:25.707
- What?

35:25.749 --> 35:28.961
- Yeah, here it is.

35:25.749 --> 35:28.961
- Really? Where was it?

35:29.002 --> 35:31.838
Behind the centerpiece. I guess

35:29.002 --> 35:31.838
the flowers kind of hid it.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.924
Behind the centerpiece?

35:33.966 --> 35:35.216
What on earth are you

35:33.966 --> 35:35.216
smiling about?

35:35.258 --> 35:36.593
I'm just glad you found it.

35:36.635 --> 35:37.886
Would you please go

35:36.635 --> 35:37.886
into the kitchen

35:37.928 --> 35:39.429
and bring out

35:37.928 --> 35:39.429
the salad course?

35:39.471 --> 35:41.514
Rory, Logan, I'm so sorry.

35:41.556 --> 35:43.516
Well, never a dull moment,

35:41.556 --> 35:43.516
as we say.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.645
(Emily)

35:43.558 --> 35:46.645
'Ah, here we are, avocado salad

35:43.558 --> 35:46.645
with beet dressing.'

35:46.686 --> 35:49.731
(Richard)

35:46.686 --> 35:49.731
'Oh, wonderful. I'm starving.'

35:52.818 --> 35:55.070
Believe me, Rory's the real star

35:52.818 --> 35:55.070
at the Yale Daily News.

35:55.112 --> 35:56.404
- People hate her.

35:55.112 --> 35:56.404
- They hate you?

35:56.446 --> 35:58.448
I'm not hated. Am I hated?

35:58.490 --> 36:00.075
She's had more pieces

35:58.490 --> 36:00.075
printed above the fold

36:00.117 --> 36:01.534
this year than anyone.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.578
Well, you are both

36:01.576 --> 36:03.578
enormously talented.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.914
Because if you have one-tenth

36:03.620 --> 36:05.914
of your father's ability

36:05.956 --> 36:07.874
young man, you are going

36:05.956 --> 36:07.874
to go straight to the top.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.751
A power couple.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.751
That's what you are.

36:09.793 --> 36:11.628
We were thrilled to hear

36:09.793 --> 36:11.628
that Rory's going to be

36:11.670 --> 36:13.338
working with your father, Logan.

36:13.379 --> 36:16.008
I'm not really working with him.

36:13.379 --> 36:16.008
Just near him, more like.

36:16.049 --> 36:17.342
She's knocking him dead

36:16.049 --> 36:17.342
over there.

36:17.383 --> 36:18.635
Now if I can just

36:17.383 --> 36:18.635
get her to relax.

36:18.677 --> 36:19.886
I'm relaxed.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.638
Speaking of relaxation,

36:19.928 --> 36:21.638
does your family

36:21.680 --> 36:22.973
still have their place

36:21.680 --> 36:22.973
on Martha's Vineyard?

36:23.015 --> 36:24.641
I think they bought it

36:23.015 --> 36:24.641
from Martha.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.267
They're not giving that up.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.267
It's not going anywhere.

36:26.309 --> 36:28.061
It's lovely in the vineyard.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.271
A few years ago, Richard and I

36:28.103 --> 36:30.271
attended a wedding there.

36:30.313 --> 36:33.066
I thought there could be no more

36:30.313 --> 36:33.066
gorgeous a spot for a wedding.

36:33.108 --> 36:34.359
It's beautiful.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.695
But then we went

36:34.400 --> 36:36.695
to one on Cape Cod

36:36.736 --> 36:38.780
and it was wonderful, too.

36:38.822 --> 36:41.033
'Either place would be good

36:38.822 --> 36:41.033
for a wedding. Don't you think?'

36:41.074 --> 36:42.742
Sure. I've been to weddings

36:41.074 --> 36:42.742
at the Cape myself.

36:42.784 --> 36:43.994
So you like Cape Cod?

36:44.036 --> 36:45.453
- Yes.

36:44.036 --> 36:45.453
- We like Cape Cod.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.246
Great.

36:47.288 --> 36:48.540
And I know Rory

36:47.288 --> 36:48.540
would like Cape Cod.

36:48.581 --> 36:50.125
I like what I've seen

36:48.581 --> 36:50.125
in pictures.

36:50.167 --> 36:52.794
You two would look

36:50.167 --> 36:52.794
awfully cute in Cape Cod.

36:52.836 --> 36:55.547
Mom, did you get a job at the

36:52.836 --> 36:55.547
Cape Cod Chamber of Commerce?

36:55.588 --> 36:57.423
No.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.342
There are a lot of kids

36:57.465 --> 36:59.342
in your family, aren't there?

36:59.384 --> 37:01.260
Yeah, the extended family's

36:59.384 --> 37:01.260
been pretty busy

37:01.302 --> 37:02.345
procreating lately.

37:02.387 --> 37:03.722
They have, have they?

37:03.763 --> 37:05.306
- Do you like kids?

37:03.763 --> 37:05.306
- Sure.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.308
Kids love Cape Cod.

37:07.350 --> 37:10.187
I think internships

37:07.350 --> 37:10.187
are a Communist plot.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.521
What?

37:11.563 --> 37:12.939
Forcing someone

37:11.563 --> 37:12.939
to work without pay?

37:12.981 --> 37:14.315
It's a little Pinko,

37:12.981 --> 37:14.315
isn't it?

37:14.357 --> 37:16.442
I mean, where's Roy Cohn

37:14.357 --> 37:16.442
when you need him?

37:16.484 --> 37:18.111
Have you lost your mind?

37:18.153 --> 37:21.073
No, no, still sloshing

37:18.153 --> 37:21.073
around up there.

37:21.114 --> 37:22.574
Would you like

37:21.114 --> 37:22.574
another apple, Rory?

37:22.615 --> 37:24.826
No, thanks. They were

37:22.615 --> 37:24.826
really good, though.

37:24.868 --> 37:26.536
How about you, Logan?

37:24.868 --> 37:26.536
Apple?

37:26.578 --> 37:28.080
Thank you, but I don't think

37:26.578 --> 37:28.080
I could eat another thing.

37:28.121 --> 37:30.331
And unfortunately,

37:28.121 --> 37:30.331
we should probably be going.

37:30.373 --> 37:32.709
- I have an early day tomorrow.

37:30.373 --> 37:32.709
- Oh, Logan, an early day.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.961
- I'm so sorry we kept you.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.961
- I wish I could stay longer.

37:35.003 --> 37:37.089
An early day is an early day.

37:35.003 --> 37:37.089
Beatrice, get their coats.

37:37.130 --> 37:39.340
I had a wonderful time.

37:37.130 --> 37:39.340
Thank you so much.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.801
Yes, thank you, grandma

37:39.382 --> 37:41.801
and grandpa. It was great.

37:41.843 --> 37:43.344
Of course, we had

37:41.843 --> 37:43.344
a wonderful time too.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.679
- Bye, mom.

37:43.386 --> 37:44.679
- Bye, hon.

37:44.721 --> 37:46.639
- Goodnight, Logan.

37:44.721 --> 37:46.639
- Nice to see you again.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.307
Nice seeing you again, too.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.307
I hope we can all--

37:48.349 --> 37:51.228
Lorelai, don't keep them.

37:48.349 --> 37:51.228
Logan has an early day tomorrow.

37:51.269 --> 37:53.188
Now, I'm going to hold

37:51.269 --> 37:53.188
you to your promise

37:53.230 --> 37:54.647
about that tennis racket.

37:54.689 --> 37:55.857
(Logan)

37:54.689 --> 37:55.857
'Oh, absolutely.

37:54.689 --> 37:55.857
I'll call you this week.'

37:55.899 --> 37:57.316
'Or maybe I'll just

37:55.899 --> 37:57.316
shoot you an e-mail.'

37:57.358 --> 37:59.986
(Emily)

37:57.358 --> 37:59.986
'Shoot me an e-mail.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.986
That is so clever.'

38:00.028 --> 38:01.654
(Richard)

38:00.028 --> 38:01.654
'That's good

38:00.028 --> 38:01.654
business sense, too.'

38:01.696 --> 38:03.656
'You have to utilize

38:01.696 --> 38:03.656
the latest technology'

38:03.698 --> 38:05.700
'or you'll fall behind.'

38:05.742 --> 38:07.702
(Emily)

38:05.742 --> 38:07.702
'Now, would you look at that?'

38:07.744 --> 38:10.496
'What a cunning little car.

38:07.744 --> 38:10.496
I adore sports coups.'

38:10.538 --> 38:12.290
(Richard)

38:10.538 --> 38:12.290
'Fine parking job, too.'

38:12.331 --> 38:13.499
(Rory)

38:12.331 --> 38:13.499
'Well, goodbye,

38:12.331 --> 38:13.499
grandma and grandpa.'

38:13.541 --> 38:15.085
(Logan)

38:13.541 --> 38:15.085
'Thanks again.'

38:15.127 --> 38:17.587
(Emily)

38:15.127 --> 38:17.587
'Goodnight, you two.

38:15.127 --> 38:17.587
Drive safe.'

38:17.629 --> 38:18.588
[door shuts]

38:21.216 --> 38:22.592
More coffee, Lorelai?

38:22.634 --> 38:24.261
No, thank you.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.265
What?

38:28.306 --> 38:31.101
Um, nothing. Just on those

38:28.306 --> 38:31.101
National Geographic shows

38:31.143 --> 38:32.602
people are so sweaty

38:31.143 --> 38:32.602
after a mating ritual.

38:32.644 --> 38:33.979
But you two are powder dry.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.730
What on earth are you

38:34.020 --> 38:35.730
talking about?

38:35.772 --> 38:38.775
They're just kids, and they're

38:35.772 --> 38:38.775
still figuring things out

38:38.817 --> 38:40.359
and they don't need you two

38:40.401 --> 38:42.195
dropping all these

38:40.401 --> 38:42.195
heavy-handed hints

38:42.237 --> 38:44.781
about weddings and babies

38:42.237 --> 38:44.781
and Cape Cod.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.741
You should be thrilled

38:44.823 --> 38:46.741
by this match, Lorelai.

38:46.783 --> 38:47.993
Who says I'm not thrilled?

38:48.034 --> 38:49.494
Well, you're not acting

38:48.034 --> 38:49.494
very thrilled.

38:49.535 --> 38:51.537
I'm annoyed at you,

38:49.535 --> 38:51.537
that's why.

38:51.579 --> 38:53.081
Putting all this pressure

38:51.579 --> 38:53.081
on them?

38:53.123 --> 38:55.125
They are in their

38:53.123 --> 38:55.125
early 20s for God's sake.

38:55.167 --> 38:56.835
You're letting your

38:55.167 --> 38:56.835
own personal tastes

38:56.876 --> 38:58.461
cloud your judgment

38:56.876 --> 38:58.461
of this boy.

38:58.503 --> 39:00.379
He's perfect for Rory,

38:58.503 --> 39:00.379
and you don't see it.

39:00.421 --> 39:02.132
This is not about

39:00.421 --> 39:02.132
my personal taste.

39:02.174 --> 39:04.425
You're uncomfortable

39:02.174 --> 39:04.425
around people like Logan.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.427
He's not your type.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.427
That's well-documented.

39:06.469 --> 39:08.680
Oh, that was a nice,

39:06.469 --> 39:08.680
not-so-subtle dig at Luke.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.556
- Luke?

39:08.721 --> 39:10.556
- Who said anything about Luke?

39:10.598 --> 39:13.351
- You're very sensitive tonight.

39:10.598 --> 39:13.351
- I'm not sensitive.

39:13.392 --> 39:14.811
It's just you're busy

39:13.392 --> 39:14.811
marrying Rory off into a family

39:14.853 --> 39:16.354
that wasn't even

39:14.853 --> 39:16.354
nice to her.

39:16.395 --> 39:18.690
- Who wasn't nice to her?

39:16.395 --> 39:18.690
- The Huntzbergers.

39:18.731 --> 39:21.651
She went over there for dinner

39:18.731 --> 39:21.651
and they treated her like trash.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.987
- I highly doubt that.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.987
- Well, they did!

39:24.029 --> 39:26.323
If the Huntzbergers

39:24.029 --> 39:26.323
were so horrible to Rory

39:26.364 --> 39:29.492
why on earth did Mitchum give

39:26.364 --> 39:29.492
her a very valuable internship?

39:29.534 --> 39:30.994
He was buying her off.

39:31.036 --> 39:32.704
So the internship

39:31.036 --> 39:32.704
was like hush money?

39:32.745 --> 39:34.372
Yes!

39:34.413 --> 39:36.666
- It's an unpaid position.

39:34.413 --> 39:36.666
- It's a figure of speech.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.794
Rory got this internship

39:36.708 --> 39:39.794
by making a contact in a way

39:39.836 --> 39:41.838
similar to me setting you up

39:39.836 --> 39:41.838
with Mike Armstrong.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.215
Is there something wrong

39:41.880 --> 39:43.215
with that?

39:43.256 --> 39:44.757
- No.

39:43.256 --> 39:44.757
- I concur.

39:44.799 --> 39:46.801
There is something wrong

39:44.799 --> 39:46.801
with this internship.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.387
- My God, you're paranoid.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.387
- I am not paranoid!

39:49.428 --> 39:51.264
'And Logan did not

39:49.428 --> 39:51.264
have an early day!'

39:51.306 --> 39:52.891
What?

39:52.932 --> 39:55.643
What 22-year-old has

39:52.932 --> 39:55.643
an early day on a Saturday?

39:55.685 --> 39:58.313
Why are you so hell-bent

39:55.685 --> 39:58.313
on derailing this match?

39:58.355 --> 39:59.814
They're perfect

39:58.355 --> 39:59.814
for each other.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.983
Okay, that word perfect,

39:59.856 --> 40:01.983
he's not.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.527
I mean, no one is, okay?

40:02.025 --> 40:04.527
But especially him.

40:04.569 --> 40:07.030
I mean, at your wedding,

40:04.569 --> 40:07.030
I caught him and Rory

40:07.072 --> 40:11.076
in the back room,

40:07.072 --> 40:11.076
uh...kissing.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.496
Kissing.

40:15.538 --> 40:16.998
You have something

40:15.538 --> 40:16.998
against kissing?

40:17.040 --> 40:18.541
I never thought of you

40:17.040 --> 40:18.541
as a prude.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.667
Paranoid, not a prude.

40:19.709 --> 40:20.960
He stole your sewing box.

40:21.002 --> 40:22.962
The sewing box

40:21.002 --> 40:22.962
is sitting on the table

40:23.004 --> 40:24.422
in the living room,

40:23.004 --> 40:24.422
Lorelai.

40:24.463 --> 40:26.132
- No, he's just--

40:24.463 --> 40:26.132
- 'Are we done here?'

40:26.174 --> 40:28.093
- No!

40:26.174 --> 40:28.093
- Good. I have a call to make.

40:28.134 --> 40:29.719
You might want

40:28.134 --> 40:29.719
that cup of coffee.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.637
Clear your head a bit

40:29.761 --> 40:31.637
before you drive home.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.057
Or maybe you just had

40:31.679 --> 40:34.057
one too many sidecars.

40:40.479 --> 40:43.233
(Charlie)

40:40.479 --> 40:43.233
So, it's not necessarily

40:40.479 --> 40:43.233
a diminishment of personnel?

40:43.275 --> 40:44.943
No, that's the advantage of

40:43.275 --> 40:44.943
using crewed reporting

40:44.984 --> 40:46.694
through the whole syndicate.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.738
By sharing the resources, you're

40:46.736 --> 40:48.738
going to have more options.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.240
With more options,

40:48.780 --> 40:50.240
you're going to be less reliant

40:50.282 --> 40:52.242
on the wire services.

40:52.284 --> 40:54.744
People will only read so many

40:52.284 --> 40:54.744
flatly written wire stories

40:54.786 --> 40:56.413
before they catch on and

40:54.786 --> 40:56.413
start reading something else

40:56.454 --> 40:58.373
or worse, turn on the TV.

40:58.415 --> 40:59.665
Coffee?

40:59.707 --> 41:02.001
- Uh..

40:59.707 --> 41:02.001
- It's decaf.

41:02.043 --> 41:03.253
Oh.

41:03.295 --> 41:06.172
Well, thank you.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.673
It's good.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.673
Alright.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.968
Let's take a look

41:07.715 --> 41:09.968
at that editorial budget.

41:13.012 --> 41:14.222
'What are you

41:13.012 --> 41:14.222
waiting for, Gilmore?'

41:14.264 --> 41:16.641
'An engraved invitation?'

41:21.604 --> 41:23.231
- Good.

41:21.604 --> 41:23.231
- Very good.

41:23.273 --> 41:25.317
- I'd say it's a nine.

41:23.273 --> 41:25.317
- Nine plus.

41:25.358 --> 41:26.401
What would make it a ten?

41:26.443 --> 41:27.986
Another half a point.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.446
Lemon juice

41:28.027 --> 41:29.446
and a handful of parsley.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.114
Yes. A tart fresh taste.

41:31.156 --> 41:33.032
Manny, try it with a little

41:31.156 --> 41:33.032
lemon juice and parsley.

41:33.074 --> 41:34.492
Okay!

41:34.533 --> 41:36.619
How long are you gonna

41:34.533 --> 41:36.619
have them working here?

41:36.661 --> 41:39.205
Well, with that fancy pants

41:36.661 --> 41:39.205
article coming out about us

41:39.247 --> 41:41.040
I want to make sure that

41:39.247 --> 41:41.040
the food stays top-notch.

41:41.082 --> 41:42.917
You know, Mike Armstrong

41:41.082 --> 41:42.917
called again.

41:42.959 --> 41:45.295
Really? That's the second time

41:42.959 --> 41:45.295
since the meeting, isn't it?

41:45.337 --> 41:47.213
Yeah, he's open

41:45.337 --> 41:47.213
to any option.

41:47.255 --> 41:49.257
Buying the inn

41:47.255 --> 41:49.257
or just investing in the inn.

41:49.299 --> 41:51.676
We'd have money again. Remember

41:49.299 --> 41:51.676
what it was like to have money?

41:51.717 --> 41:53.886
Keeping us on to run it.

41:51.717 --> 41:53.886
We could consult.

41:53.928 --> 41:55.472
We could travel

41:53.928 --> 41:55.472
around the world

41:55.513 --> 41:57.265
telling other people

41:55.513 --> 41:57.265
how to run their inns.

41:57.307 --> 42:00.059
We could be bossy. Ooh,

41:57.307 --> 42:00.059
we could travel and be bossy!

42:00.101 --> 42:01.811
He mentioned

42:00.101 --> 42:01.811
the south of France.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.855
Apparently, they're making

42:01.853 --> 42:03.855
a huge investment there

42:03.896 --> 42:05.857
and they have a need

42:03.896 --> 42:05.857
for people like us.

42:05.898 --> 42:08.360
I can picture us in the south

42:05.898 --> 42:08.360
of France. Ooh, topless!

42:08.401 --> 42:10.236
- At work?

42:08.401 --> 42:10.236
- No, we're on the beach.

42:10.278 --> 42:11.779
- Much more appropriate.

42:10.278 --> 42:11.779
- And the casinos.

42:11.821 --> 42:13.531
Oh, and the cheese.

42:13.572 --> 42:15.783
You know, my dad traveled

42:13.572 --> 42:15.783
all over the world for work

42:15.825 --> 42:17.702
which drove my mom crazy,

42:15.825 --> 42:17.702
which was a little perk.

42:17.743 --> 42:19.162
But he'd always say

42:17.743 --> 42:19.162
things like

42:19.204 --> 42:21.289
"I'll be back

42:19.204 --> 42:21.289
from Dusseldorf on Friday."

42:21.331 --> 42:23.375
And when I was a kid,

42:21.331 --> 42:23.375
I always wanted to say

42:23.416 --> 42:25.210
"I'll be back

42:23.416 --> 42:25.210
from Dusseldorf on Friday."

42:25.251 --> 42:27.003
Oh, that would be great.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.630
To get into all those famous

42:27.045 --> 42:29.630
kitchens I've always read about.

42:29.672 --> 42:31.716
We'd have expense accounts

42:29.672 --> 42:31.716
and travel luggage.

42:31.757 --> 42:34.052
- It would be exciting, huh?

42:31.757 --> 42:34.052
- Yeah, it would!

42:35.678 --> 42:37.722
But I can't do that.

42:37.763 --> 42:41.559
I have Davey and little

42:37.763 --> 42:41.559
no-name here and Jackson.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.936
Jackson wouldn't want

42:41.600 --> 42:43.936
to go topless in France.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.688
- Yeah.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.688
- 'My life is here.'

42:45.730 --> 42:47.106
Yeah, sure.

42:47.148 --> 42:48.649
- But you could go.

42:47.148 --> 42:48.649
- What?

42:48.691 --> 42:50.651
'Your kid's in college.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.651
You're young.'

42:50.693 --> 42:51.819
You love to travel.

42:51.861 --> 42:54.072
You look amazing topless.

42:54.113 --> 42:55.490
You could go.

42:55.532 --> 42:57.242
I mean,

42:55.532 --> 42:57.242
what's stopping you?

42:57.283 --> 42:59.494
- Well..

42:57.283 --> 42:59.494
- Ooh! Snap peas!

42:59.536 --> 43:02.330
Snap peas would be

42:59.536 --> 43:02.330
good in this.

43:02.372 --> 43:03.831
Manny, snap peas!

43:03.873 --> 43:06.042
'Snap peas, yeah!'
