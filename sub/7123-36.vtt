00:36.745 --> 00:37.871
What...

00:37.955 --> 00:39.127
is the meaning of soup?

00:39.206 --> 00:40.708
What? I don't know.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.338
What's with all the
weird quest...

00:42.417 --> 00:44.010
What is the meaning of spoon?

00:44.086 --> 00:45.178
Shoot, man.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.803
Are you still lady-sad
about Flame Princess?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.474
You know, it's okay if you are.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.348
Nah. That's all fine.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.770
I've just been feeling
kind of gray, is all.

00:53.845 --> 00:56.268
Like, my inside voice has
been kind of quiet lately,

00:56.348 --> 00:58.692
not a lot of instructions
forthcoming, you know?

00:58.767 --> 01:01.270
Yeah, well, sounds
like you're sad.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.570
Listen, Finn.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.819
Girls is like horses...
When you fall down,

01:04.897 --> 01:07.697
it's important that you get
right back on again...

01:07.776 --> 01:09.119
on a different horse.

01:09.194 --> 01:12.539
And there's a lot of fish
in the sea, a lot of fish.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.413
A penny saved is a penny earned.

01:15.492 --> 01:17.745
Yeah... l-l guess.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.672
Or maybe dating girls is
like riding a bicycle...

01:20.747 --> 01:22.169
Yeah, man, yeah!

01:22.249 --> 01:23.671
Where, like, if you mess up,

01:23.750 --> 01:26.003
you can get really hurt
forever or hurt someone

01:26.086 --> 01:27.086
you really care about.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.302
Uh, well, I suppose.

01:29.381 --> 01:32.476
Anyway, I hope this mystery cave
we're looking for is <i>as</i> weird <i>as</i>

01:32.551 --> 01:34.428
Flambo's brother says it is.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.354
Maybe that'll snap
you out of the...

01:36.430 --> 01:37.647
Whoa! What?!

01:37.723 --> 01:39.600
What's this train all about?

01:39.683 --> 01:42.232
No one said nothing about
no train in the way.

01:42.311 --> 01:43.312
Relax, buddy.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.817
We'll just cross
after it passes.

01:44.896 --> 01:46.648
No big thing, really.

01:46.732 --> 01:47.733
Oh, yeah.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.614
It's two hours later now.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.037
What the stonk?

01:54.031 --> 01:55.704
Oh. Okay.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.748
Hey, the train just
goes in a big circle.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.454
We can cut right
through the middle.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.754
Blingle, blongle, bloongle.

02:01.830 --> 02:02.830
Come on.

02:03.915 --> 02:06.668
Hey, you know, I just
had another idea.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.425
If we just stay put
here on the train,

02:08.502 --> 02:10.505
we can ride it all
the way to the cave.

02:10.589 --> 02:11.886
Blingle, blongle, bloongle!

02:11.965 --> 02:13.285
Hyah! Give me...
Give me the loot!

02:13.342 --> 02:14.639
Ow! Yow!

02:14.718 --> 02:15.560
Come on, give it!

02:15.636 --> 02:16.478
Give me that hat!

02:16.553 --> 02:17.349
Knock it off.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.429
Aah!

02:18.472 --> 02:20.065
Whoa, dang!

02:21.016 --> 02:21.938
Hey, Finn!

02:22.017 --> 02:22.893
Whoa.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.621
Look at all the loot that
guy dropped while you

02:24.645 --> 02:25.862
whipped his butt.

02:25.937 --> 02:26.779
Dang.

02:26.855 --> 02:27.697
Look at that sword.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.775
Whoa. It feels kind of right.

02:29.858 --> 02:33.362
Whoosh. Whoosh.

02:33.445 --> 02:34.697
Whoosh, whoosh.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.032
Whoosh!

02:37.199 --> 02:38.325
Whoa.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.577
It's pretty fun, huh?

02:40.661 --> 02:41.537
Yeah, man!

02:41.620 --> 02:42.963
It's spicy baby fun!

02:43.038 --> 02:45.266
You want to go see what other kind
of monsters are on this train?

02:45.290 --> 02:46.290
Yes!

02:48.710 --> 02:50.678
Whoa. Crystal ants, I think.

02:53.757 --> 02:54.757
Cool.

02:58.845 --> 02:59.971
Yeah!

03:01.598 --> 03:02.440
Die! Die! Die! Die!

03:02.516 --> 03:03.608
Die! Die! Die!

03:05.519 --> 03:06.519
Ha!

03:09.564 --> 03:10.941
Welcome back, buddy.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.995
Man, look at all this rad loot.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.118
Yeah, this is a
pretty neat train.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.665
We should come back
again someday.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.832
Wow, what do you mean?

03:19.908 --> 03:21.706
We just started only
like three hours ago.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.336
Yeah... l-I'm just getting
a little bored, is all.

03:26.415 --> 03:29.089
All these cars and monsters
are kind of all the same.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.714
It's a little boring.

03:30.794 --> 03:32.171
Oh, come on. It's fun.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.426
Just one more car.

03:33.505 --> 03:34.505
Come on. Come on, man.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.548
Come on!

03:35.590 --> 03:36.590
All right.

03:36.633 --> 03:37.555
Just one more.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.681
Yes!

03:42.639 --> 03:43.435
Hmm?

03:43.515 --> 03:44.641
Where is everybody?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.602
Hey, hey! Empty car.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.312
I think we beat it, buddy.

03:58.071 --> 03:58.913
Whoa, man.

03:58.989 --> 03:59.990
Boss battle!

04:00.073 --> 04:01.450
Let's chew it up!

04:01.533 --> 04:03.535
Okay, but this is
the last one, okay?

04:03.618 --> 04:05.370
We'll see!

04:10.834 --> 04:13.633
Hey, man. Remember we were
going to that weird cave'?

04:13.712 --> 04:15.840
I bet it's not too
late to check it out.

04:15.922 --> 04:19.596
Eh, weird cave, weird train.

04:19.676 --> 04:20.892
I'm cool here.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.143
Okay-

04:24.222 --> 04:26.020
Hyah!

04:26.099 --> 04:28.397
Aah! Give me a break!

04:29.811 --> 04:31.279
Oh?

04:31.354 --> 04:32.230
Oh, dang.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.314
Boss loot!

04:36.067 --> 04:37.944
Mm, mm-mm, mm-mm-mm.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.075
Oh, yes.

04:47.329 --> 04:48.546
No, thank you.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.464
Jake, hurry!

04:49.539 --> 04:50.586
Next car!

04:55.879 --> 04:57.347
Slime crimes!

04:58.381 --> 04:59.177
You have fun.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.349
I'm just gonna watch.

05:00.425 --> 05:04.646
Yeah! Huh! Ugh!

05:04.721 --> 05:05.643
Hey!

05:05.722 --> 05:07.349
Ow! Ow

05:07.432 --> 05:09.105
Cool. Acid.

05:15.440 --> 05:18.694
Hey, also, man, aren't you,
like, getting kind of hungry?

05:18.777 --> 05:19.653
Yeah, man.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.005
I guess we've been
here for a while.

05:21.029 --> 05:22.201
More than a while, dude.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.078
I've already missed
my bathroom window.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.285
Yeah, I guess I could
take a snack break.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.540
Okay.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.096
Well, we'll go back
to the tree house,

05:29.120 --> 05:30.240
and I'll make us some lunch.

05:30.288 --> 05:32.006
I could make the toaster
pancakes you like.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.800
Or maybe I can boil
up some hot dogs.

05:33.875 --> 05:34.875
Or...

05:36.211 --> 05:39.135
Look, now we don't got to do
that thing you wanted to do.

05:41.216 --> 05:42.263
Aah!

05:42.342 --> 05:43.468
Hot meat!

05:47.180 --> 05:48.397
Ants again?!

05:48.473 --> 05:50.475
Ant no thang!

05:51.434 --> 05:52.434
Hyah!

05:52.477 --> 05:53.854
Caught with your ants down!

05:53.937 --> 05:55.405
Ants for nothing!

05:55.480 --> 05:56.823
Forget about ants.

05:56.898 --> 05:57.898
What's wrong?

05:57.941 --> 05:59.659
Feeling antsy?!

06:02.112 --> 06:03.989
Dude, this is the ant car.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.665
We already did the ant car.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.117
You did all the ants.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.373
Same car... Ugh...

06:09.452 --> 06:10.874
But those were blue ants.

06:10.954 --> 06:11.954
These are red ants.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.795
Finn, I think we
should take off.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.751
I think this place
is bad news for you.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.006
Man, no way.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.883
All this feels good,

06:18.962 --> 06:20.147
like my inside voice is saying,

06:20.171 --> 06:21.923
"Hey, keep it up.
This is good stuff."

06:22.007 --> 06:24.351
Aah! Hey! Hyah!

06:24.426 --> 06:26.474
Like when you made those
biscuits way back and

06:26.553 --> 06:28.726
I kept eating them until they
were all gone, like that.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.148
Finn!

06:30.223 --> 06:33.067
I made those biscuits
with so much butter.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.941
You were just responding
to the butter!

06:35.020 --> 06:36.693
This whole place is butter!

06:36.771 --> 06:37.988
Yeah!

06:44.487 --> 06:46.489
Boss fight!

06:46.573 --> 06:47.825
Yeah!

06:52.537 --> 06:53.834
Hyah!

07:04.049 --> 07:07.599
My junk and stuff!

07:09.387 --> 07:10.183
Check it out.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.310
Battle moon.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.569
What?

07:19.147 --> 07:21.991
Finn, this is a future crystal!
Look!

07:22.067 --> 07:23.660
That's you, dude.

07:23.735 --> 07:27.490
You're old, you're alone,
and you're still fighting

07:27.572 --> 07:29.324
on this dumb train.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.502
Old get ant of town.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.794
Whoa.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.793
I'm gonna have the best life.

07:45.048 --> 07:46.300
Oh! Hair apes!

07:46.383 --> 07:47.475
Nah, dude.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.972
I'm bored, I'm tired,

07:49.052 --> 07:51.851
and I'm going back...
to the tree house.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.982
You can come with
me if you want.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.310
What? No, man.

07:56.393 --> 07:57.861
It's better on the train.

07:57.936 --> 07:58.983
Stuff makes sense here.

08:00.063 --> 08:02.691
Ow!

08:02.774 --> 08:03.991
I'm sorry.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.027
If you wish to join me,
I'll be in the tree house,

08:06.069 --> 08:08.447
experiencing the joys of life
and not getting attacked

08:08.530 --> 08:10.157
by gorillas made out of hair.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.241
You'll be back.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.792
No, I won't, Finn.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.579
Goodbye!

08:17.998 --> 08:18.998
Huh.

08:19.874 --> 08:20.874
Hey!

08:21.668 --> 08:23.090
Hair we go!

08:27.132 --> 08:28.401
Hey, what are you doing up here?

08:28.425 --> 08:29.472
Whoop.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.306
Are you getting sick of
things down there, too?

08:34.389 --> 08:35.515
Whoo.

08:35.597 --> 08:36.975
Mm-hmm.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.356
You're not gonna try
and zap me, are you?

08:50.530 --> 08:52.953
I wonder what my kids are doing.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.707
Hey.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.962
I knew it.

09:08.715 --> 09:09.762
Got to find that kid.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.968
Hey, Finn!

09:12.052 --> 09:13.304
F... whoa.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.354
Um... hey, there, friend.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.852
I ain't looking for no trouble.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.729
I'm just looking for
my friend Finn.

09:18.808 --> 09:19.808
Maybe you've seen him?

09:19.851 --> 09:21.774
About five feet tall,
picks his nose,

09:21.853 --> 09:23.947
and always kind of
smells funny I...

09:24.022 --> 09:25.023
Hey. Hey.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.232
Jake, it's me.

09:26.316 --> 09:27.533
I'm just all souped up now.

09:27.609 --> 09:28.781
Ah, geez, Finn.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.079
I... for a minute there, I
thought you were one of

09:31.154 --> 09:32.154
those twisted,

09:32.197 --> 09:33.449
lost-soul, boss guys.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.999
La, la, la.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.122
Wait. You are!

09:36.201 --> 09:37.123
You are one!

09:37.202 --> 09:38.044
What?

09:38.119 --> 09:38.915
Those guys are cool.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.417
That's it, man.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.797
I'm getting you off this train
whether you like it or not.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.297
Jake, stay back.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.468
I mean it.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.591
Oh, please.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.670
What are you gonna do'?

09:48.713 --> 09:50.010
I'm 10 times stronger th...

09:50.090 --> 09:52.184
Hey!

09:53.885 --> 09:55.558
Oh, gross.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.596
Yoink!

09:59.015 --> 10:02.690
Jake, trying to
tell me what to do.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.861
Yeah, right.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.405
I tells me what to do.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.823
Now, let's see what we got here.

10:06.898 --> 10:09.492
Apple, apple, chicken, apple.

10:09.567 --> 10:10.989
Oh, yeah.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.571
That little orb in which I rule.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.531
Let's see that again, Orb.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.082
Yeah. That's right.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.500
Looking right.

10:17.575 --> 10:18.827
Wait a second.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.129
Who's that sad, bored little
guy following me around?

10:21.204 --> 10:22.501
Jake?

10:22.580 --> 10:24.958
All those years,
he stayed with me.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.920
Finn, can we slow down?

10:28.002 --> 10:30.004
My feet hurt.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.219
What?

10:32.298 --> 10:33.220
Oh, Jake.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.471
Hang in there, buddy.

10:34.551 --> 10:35.848
I'm gonna set this right.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.770
Finn! Finn, I'm sorry.

10:37.846 --> 10:38.989
I'll stay on the train with you.

10:39.013 --> 10:39.855
I swear.

10:39.931 --> 10:41.353
Just get this stuff off of me.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.025
No, I'm sorry, Jake.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.273
I messed up.

10:44.352 --> 10:45.194
But don't worry.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.396
It's all over now.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.152
You mean, we're getting
off the train?

10:48.231 --> 10:50.233
Well... you are.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.989
I'm gonna keep
playing for a while.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.337
I'll meet you back
home in a week or two.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.283
Oh, man.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.740
Don't you see that's
just the train talking?

10:56.823 --> 10:58.541
It's got its hooks in you.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.459
No. No, for real.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.788
My inside voice is
telling me it's time.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.965
Here. See for yourself.

11:06.249 --> 11:07.751
Yeah, man.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.757
That's what I'm talking about.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.259
That is what I'm talking about.
