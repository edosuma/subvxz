00:14.188 --> 00:15.972
Allow me the honor of
introducing your next governor

00:16.059 --> 00:20.281
John Dutton, and U.S. Senator
Lynelle Perry.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.979
Look at him.
His father is the governor.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.328
He'll be next.

00:24.415 --> 00:26.939
This should be the happiest
day of his life.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.115
Why isn't he smiling?

00:28.202 --> 00:31.074
Get Sarah Atwood out here.

00:31.161 --> 00:34.034
It's time we took
the gloves off.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.384
Is this a good thing
or a bad thing?

00:36.471 --> 00:38.125
It's a good thing for
the land but I don't see

00:38.212 --> 00:40.040
how it's good for us.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.216
Supreme Court Justice:
Congratulations.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.522
My God. Four years
is a long time.

00:44.609 --> 00:46.568
This is not where
I want to spend it.

00:46.655 --> 00:49.179
Hey. It's me.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.963
Carter.

00:51.051 --> 00:53.009
Jesus. It's been a while.

00:53.096 --> 00:55.185
The cramps are getting worse.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.753
- I'll send an ambulance out to
meet you on the road, okay.
- Okay.

01:01.104 --> 01:01.974
You need to go to Billings.

01:04.586 --> 01:07.197
I had a brother
for an hour.

01:07.284 --> 01:08.764
They named him John.

01:24.519 --> 01:25.781
Mom?

01:53.765 --> 01:55.680
Ah!

02:26.755 --> 02:27.886
Mom?

02:30.019 --> 02:31.020
No!

02:34.893 --> 02:37.418
Mom! Mom!

02:43.467 --> 02:46.557
Mama! Mama!

02:46.644 --> 02:50.257
No! Stay there!

02:50.344 --> 02:52.955
Find your phone,
call an ambulance.

02:54.435 --> 02:56.437
Now!

03:35.780 --> 03:38.174
Male Operator: <i>9-1-1.
What's your emergency?</i>

03:38.261 --> 03:39.654
We had a wreck.
My mother's having a baby.

03:39.741 --> 03:40.872
We need an ambulance.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.700
<i>Is anyone hurt?</i>

03:42.787 --> 03:44.702
Everybody's hurt.
We need an ambulance.

03:44.789 --> 03:45.877
Do you know where you are?

03:45.964 --> 03:47.749
We're on the road to Billings.

03:47.836 --> 03:51.448
I don't know the road.

03:51.535 --> 03:52.797
I can send you a pin.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.234
<i>I'll give you a number.</i>

03:54.321 --> 03:54.930
<i>Let me know when
you're ready...</i>

03:55.017 --> 03:57.237
I'm ready.

03:57.324 --> 04:02.285
<i>406-412-0911.</i>

04:03.852 --> 04:05.288
- I sent it.
- <i>Good.</i>

04:05.375 --> 04:06.420
<i>What's your name?</i>

04:06.507 --> 04:08.291
Tate Dutton.

04:08.378 --> 04:09.423
<i>There is already an
ambulance en route, Tate.</i>

04:10.815 --> 04:11.860
Mom!

04:11.947 --> 04:14.341
Tell them to hurry!

05:34.856 --> 05:35.552
Dad?

05:50.654 --> 05:51.873
I'm coming, buddy.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.599
She gonna be okay?

06:28.388 --> 06:30.564
She's a strong woman, son.

06:30.651 --> 06:31.652
That's not what I asked.

06:33.523 --> 06:34.437
We're all gonna be okay.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.702
It's just... gonna take time.

06:40.748 --> 06:43.446
You lost a brother.
I lost a son.

06:43.533 --> 06:44.839
But she lost more.

06:48.059 --> 06:51.933
He was a... part of her,
so she lost a part of herself.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.413
If that makes sense.

06:56.894 --> 06:57.895
Yeah.

07:00.028 --> 07:01.595
Are you gonna try again?

07:03.161 --> 07:04.598
For another one?

07:08.253 --> 07:09.690
I don't know.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.084
I think you should.

07:13.171 --> 07:14.695
I liked having a brother.

08:04.135 --> 08:06.268
I want you to go
saddle up Mister Dutton's horse.

08:06.355 --> 08:07.965
Is he here?

08:08.052 --> 08:10.141
No, but we need to
keep him legged up.

08:10.228 --> 08:11.273
Who's gonna ride him?

08:11.360 --> 08:12.753
You are.

08:14.668 --> 08:16.800
- I am?
- That's right.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.628
I don't have
all fucking day, let's go.

08:18.715 --> 08:20.587
Go grab him.

08:25.635 --> 08:28.246
God didn't add extra daylight
to Tuesday, Carter.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.205
Now, let's go, man.

08:30.292 --> 08:31.511
Go get his fucking saddle.
Let's move this along.

08:35.123 --> 08:37.734
I think this fucker tripped
this morning and hit his head.

08:40.694 --> 08:41.956
Let's go!

08:46.047 --> 08:47.483
Fuck this, you can take
care of this shit.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.484
I'm not dealing
with it anymore.

08:48.571 --> 08:49.703
We'll catch up.

08:54.621 --> 08:57.537
Don't do it fast,
do it right, now.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.066
Back cinch.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.111
Right.

09:07.198 --> 09:09.679
You know, kid, you only do
this fifteen times a day.

09:09.766 --> 09:11.289
I know,
I just don't do it for myself.

09:13.683 --> 09:14.379
Uh, right.
What else?

09:15.903 --> 09:17.078
Where's your rope?

09:20.342 --> 09:23.867
What else?

09:23.954 --> 09:25.086
Right, fuck hat.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.783
Chaps if you got 'em.

09:26.870 --> 09:27.871
All right.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.050
Hell, I think those
used to be mine.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.617
All right, what else?

09:34.704 --> 09:35.749
We ain't got time
for what else.

09:35.836 --> 09:37.968
Swing on up there, cowboy.

09:39.535 --> 09:40.971
All right, now we play
catch up. Come on.

10:02.950 --> 10:05.082
This is unbelievable.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.997
Why do I have all these
damn meetings in one day?

10:07.084 --> 10:09.609
Because tomorrow
you're in Butte,

10:09.696 --> 10:12.133
and then Thursday you speak
in Missoula.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.178
Why am I in Butte?

10:14.265 --> 10:15.571
You're speaking at
White Song Elementary

10:15.658 --> 10:17.007
about your new
education initiative.

10:17.094 --> 10:19.401
What's my new
education initiative?

10:19.488 --> 10:23.144
Uh, it's uh...

10:23.231 --> 10:25.450
"To further education
with hands-on learning

10:25.537 --> 10:29.193
through the Dalton-Wiggins
Technical and Trade Academy."

10:29.280 --> 10:31.195
Never heard of it.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.981
It's a trade school.

10:34.068 --> 10:35.591
Run by the state?

10:35.678 --> 10:37.593
No, it's a private
technical college.

10:42.424 --> 10:43.730
Answer me this, Clara.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.775
Who exactly is
my Chief of Staff?

10:45.862 --> 10:48.038
The party's nominating
committee chose Jim Roberts.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.518
Is Jim Roberts
in the building?

10:49.605 --> 10:51.563
He's in his office.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.000
Could you bring him
to me, please?

10:53.087 --> 10:54.044
Mm-hm.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.703
I forewarned you,
if you don't pick 'em

11:00.790 --> 11:02.313
- they will pick them for you.
- Mm.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.362
Governor, it's an honor.

11:07.449 --> 11:11.975
Tell me, which one is your
buddy, Dalton or Wiggins?

11:12.062 --> 11:13.585
Uh--

11:13.673 --> 11:14.804
The beneficiaries
of the education initiative

11:14.891 --> 11:17.241
that I'm unaware
that I support.

11:17.328 --> 11:20.854
The education initiative--

11:20.941 --> 11:25.336
Jim, I'd like to introduce
you to my daughter, Beth.

11:25.423 --> 11:28.600
Pleasure to meet you.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.560
She's my new Chief of Staff.
Get out of my office.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.394
Now, Jim.
- If I could just--

11:39.481 --> 11:42.310
You can't.
Get the fuck out of my office.

11:47.576 --> 11:50.318
Dad, I, uh...

11:50.405 --> 11:52.973
I don't have time
to follow you around the state.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.278
You got me into this, sweetheart,

11:54.365 --> 11:57.281
you're going to
get me through it, now.

11:57.368 --> 11:58.456
Hand her that satchel.

11:58.543 --> 12:01.242
The football.
We call it the football.

12:01.329 --> 12:02.591
All right, Clara.
The football.

12:02.678 --> 12:03.810
Now hand her the football.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.463
Let's start with this schedule.

12:12.427 --> 12:15.430
Um, well...

12:15.517 --> 12:18.955
in 15 minutes
you have a meeting

12:19.042 --> 12:20.435
with the
Montana Trade Alliance.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.526
What's that?

12:24.613 --> 12:26.136
Their focus is enhancing
trade between foreign nations.

12:26.223 --> 12:28.660
What does that have
to do with me?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.053
It's politics, John.

12:30.140 --> 12:31.402
You're going to shake
a lot of hands,

12:31.489 --> 12:32.621
you're gonna
take a lot of photos.

12:32.708 --> 12:33.840
It amounts to
absolutely nothing,

12:33.927 --> 12:35.276
but it does maintain
the good will

12:35.363 --> 12:36.364
with the people
that elected you.

12:36.451 --> 12:37.931
I'm not seeking good will.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.324
I'm seeking the end of
the airport on my land.

12:40.411 --> 12:42.109
Well, as Governor,
you can cancel funding

12:42.196 --> 12:43.980
and tax rebates for the build.

12:44.067 --> 12:47.157
They'll file an emergency
injunction to block the order.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.680
A judge will uphold
your decision,

12:48.768 --> 12:50.726
and Market Equities
will just go get a loan

12:50.813 --> 12:53.250
from Blackstone or Goldmans, and
continue to keep on building.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.774
Then cancel the lease.

12:57.298 --> 12:58.603
You can't cancel the lease.

12:58.690 --> 13:00.127
They will sue you and win.

13:00.214 --> 13:03.478
The lease has
progress thresholds.

13:03.565 --> 13:05.393
That build site
cannot lay dormant.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.221
They have a one year
grace built into the lease.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.701
I'm not waiting a year.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.704
Revoke the funding.

13:12.792 --> 13:16.752
Order an environmental review
and cancel the lease.

13:16.839 --> 13:20.451
They will sue you.
And I mean you.

13:20.538 --> 13:23.454
Halting the build
will create real damages.

13:23.541 --> 13:26.283
And canceling the lease, that's
how they end up with your ranch.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.502
He's right, John.

13:30.679 --> 13:33.943
That land is zoned
agricultural, right?

13:35.249 --> 13:36.685
Yeah.

13:36.772 --> 13:39.862
So how are they building
an airport and condos

13:39.949 --> 13:42.299
on land that is agricultural?

13:48.436 --> 13:49.698
The application
has already been submitted.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.395
It's a formality.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.397
The Commissioners are gonna
sit on it as long

13:53.484 --> 13:55.356
as they get free dinners
and campaign contributions.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.531
Right, so, it's
not yet approved.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.359
Not yet.

13:58.446 --> 14:01.144
Surely there is some law
that prevents the state

14:01.231 --> 14:05.366
from funding projects that are
not, you know, properly zoned?

14:05.453 --> 14:07.324
Yes, Beth, there is,

14:07.411 --> 14:09.587
and that statute is waived
by this office all the time.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.328
Well, not this time.

14:11.415 --> 14:15.158
Clara, will you set a drink
for the Governor and myself,

14:15.245 --> 14:17.117
and the Park County
Commissioners?

14:17.204 --> 14:18.945
- Just Ronnie and Kyle.
- For what day?

14:19.032 --> 14:20.642
Today.

14:20.729 --> 14:22.383
The Governor
has a dinner tonight with

14:22.470 --> 14:23.732
the Montana Clean
River Alliance--

14:23.819 --> 14:25.386
For fuck's sakes, Clara,

14:25.473 --> 14:28.998
if it has the word "alliance"
in the name, cancel it.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.305
00 P.M. Deerfield Club.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.002
And Clara, you're going to
want to pack a bag.

14:33.089 --> 14:35.091
We're going to take
this party south.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.353
I think our work is done here.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.182
Not yet.

14:43.099 --> 14:45.058
I want it on my desk in an hour.

14:47.756 --> 14:51.499
Can we talk about this,
just you and me?

14:51.586 --> 14:53.414
Just you and him?

14:53.501 --> 14:55.633
How many one-on-one
conversations

14:55.720 --> 14:57.505
do you want me having?

14:57.592 --> 14:59.289
Just go do your fucking job.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.815
- Okay.
- Good.

15:08.777 --> 15:09.473
See you in a bit.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.960
Clara, can I take
a peek at his schedule?

15:20.223 --> 15:26.012
Okay, I'll absorb as many
of these as I can.

15:26.099 --> 15:29.276
John, the Governor's office
is a game of favors.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.843
You start by giving them,
then you can ask for them.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.236
When the State committee
finds out that

15:33.323 --> 15:35.021
you are not in this
for the long haul,

15:35.108 --> 15:38.024
everyone that supported you will
be looking for a parachute.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.983
Market Equities will
not just go away.

15:41.070 --> 15:43.420
This will be a fight.
A big one.

15:43.507 --> 15:44.900
When they realize that all
they have to do

15:44.987 --> 15:47.859
is wait four years,
then they'll just wait.

15:47.947 --> 15:53.039
You need to change laws if you
want them to never come back.

15:53.126 --> 15:56.694
To change laws,
you need favors.

15:56.781 --> 15:58.435
You should've never
let them in, Lynelle.

16:02.135 --> 16:05.877
I didn't grant
them the lease, John.

16:05.965 --> 16:09.055
Jamie did, and he was
really wise to do so.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.927
The land Board is made
up of five officers:

16:12.014 --> 16:13.668
the Governor,
the Attorney General,

16:13.755 --> 16:15.322
the Secretary of State,
the Auditor,

16:15.409 --> 16:17.498
and the public
interests Superintendent.

16:17.585 --> 16:21.719
Now who do you think funded the
campaigns for the other three?

16:21.806 --> 16:24.026
If it had gone
before the land committee,

16:24.113 --> 16:27.334
the state would own your land.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.684
That's their next move

16:29.771 --> 16:31.251
when you cancel the lease,
by the way.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.039
You could be a
really good leader, John,

16:37.126 --> 16:38.693
but you're a shitty politician

16:38.780 --> 16:40.042
because you won't
play the game.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.568
But if you don't play the game,
the game plays you.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.441
I'm here for another month.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.008
Use me.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.924
That's a refreshing thought.

16:53.012 --> 16:53.708
It's not what I meant.

16:59.192 --> 17:00.106
Hey.

17:03.631 --> 17:04.719
Hey!

17:17.471 --> 17:19.299
That's how you
slam a door, Jamie.

17:21.823 --> 17:24.043
Never contradict him again.

17:24.130 --> 17:26.132
When he says jump you
don't ask how high,

17:26.219 --> 17:28.047
you just start
fucking hopping.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.526
I am trying to protect him
and the ranch.

17:29.613 --> 17:32.225
This isn't some sleazy developer
from Beverly Hills,

17:32.312 --> 17:34.227
this is a multinational firm
that has invested

17:34.314 --> 17:36.272
billions of dollars,

17:36.359 --> 17:39.536
and leveraged billions more
on the back of this development.

17:39.623 --> 17:41.886
They will fight you.
They will fight you dirty.

17:41.973 --> 17:45.194
Is there any other way?

17:45.281 --> 17:46.978
I want to believe
that you're advising

17:47.066 --> 17:49.894
what's best for
the family, I do.

17:49.981 --> 17:53.898
but then I remember:
this isn't your family.

17:53.985 --> 17:56.945
And he's not your father.

17:57.032 --> 17:59.121
And we both know how
you treated your own father.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.169
Just stop thinking
that you have a chance

18:03.256 --> 18:05.388
to earn redemption, Jamie.
You don't.

18:05.475 --> 18:07.477
Just do as you're fucking told

18:07.564 --> 18:10.393
until these fuckers tuck
tail back to New York.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.135
Then I will just quietly
put you out to pasture.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.582
Your political career was over

18:25.669 --> 18:28.150
the moment you chose
your father over mine.

18:30.152 --> 18:33.373
You're in my prison now.

18:33.460 --> 18:37.855
And if you ever forget it...

18:37.942 --> 18:38.769
I'll put you in a real one.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.306
I, uh, heard
you sold your ranch.

18:58.615 --> 19:01.270
I want you home
at the weekends.

19:02.358 --> 19:03.403
Where I can keep an eye on ya.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.107
Say "Yes, ma'am."

19:14.544 --> 19:16.242
Yes, ma'am.

19:18.592 --> 19:19.593
Good boy.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.137
What are you doing here?

21:11.095 --> 21:13.707
Just here.
In case you need something.

21:33.857 --> 21:35.119
We need to have a funeral.

21:38.253 --> 21:40.777
Just us.

21:40.864 --> 21:43.258
I don't need fifty people
to tell me how sorry they are.

21:49.090 --> 21:51.527
I should've been here.

21:51.614 --> 21:52.920
I should've
driven you myself.

21:53.007 --> 21:56.184
We're not gonna do that.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.838
No "should've."

21:57.925 --> 22:02.538
I could "should"
myself to death.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.414
But I won't. And I won't
let you do it either.

22:15.856 --> 22:17.684
I'd like to
bury him at the ranch.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.514
That way we can
always visit him.

22:24.647 --> 22:26.388
Ask your father.

22:27.955 --> 22:31.219
His answer will be yes.
You know that.

22:31.306 --> 22:32.829
Ask anyway.

22:34.875 --> 22:36.311
I'll do it.

22:51.587 --> 22:53.633
When you said you saw
the end of us...

22:55.722 --> 22:56.505
is this what you saw?

23:02.555 --> 23:04.818
No, baby.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.428
I never saw this coming.

23:09.649 --> 23:12.913
And this won't
be the end of us.

23:13.000 --> 23:13.696
What will?

23:18.266 --> 23:19.659
I would have to choose
the end of us.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.010
And I will never choose that.

23:32.759 --> 23:34.717
Tate said he wants
us to try again.

23:34.804 --> 23:35.849
Said he wants a brother.

23:39.853 --> 23:42.029
I really
wanted him to have one.

23:44.510 --> 23:48.035
Hey, come here.

24:39.565 --> 24:40.783
Hey!

24:43.264 --> 24:45.527
Hey!

24:48.748 --> 24:49.749
Lloyd!

24:54.884 --> 24:56.930
Shit. Wolves.

24:57.017 --> 24:58.932
Yep.

24:59.019 --> 25:00.934
It's odd they'd
go after the mama, though.

25:01.021 --> 25:02.588
She was probably
protecting her calf.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.594
I don't think
wolves killed it.

25:08.681 --> 25:10.813
You got wolf tracks
all around.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.859
Ate the stomach
and the ass out.

25:12.946 --> 25:14.077
That's what wolves do.

25:14.164 --> 25:15.470
Not saying they didn't
eat it,

25:15.557 --> 25:17.516
I'm saying they didn't kill it.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.213
No bites on the hocks.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.562
Wolves found her down...

25:20.649 --> 25:22.912
Don't matter,
they got the taste of beef.

25:22.999 --> 25:24.348
Can you get us
depredation tags?

25:24.435 --> 25:26.350
Let me call Kayce, let's
get a state hunter out here.

25:26.437 --> 25:27.613
We ain't going to Kayce

25:27.700 --> 25:29.005
with all the shit
he's dealing with.

25:29.092 --> 25:31.007
And we don't need state hunters
out here three days

25:31.094 --> 25:32.835
into Mister Dutton's term.

25:32.922 --> 25:35.142
Just gets us tags and
we'll deal with it ourselves.

25:35.229 --> 25:36.622
Lloyd, let's start moving this
herd back toward the barn.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.014
Hey, got a stray
over here, boys.

25:38.101 --> 25:40.321
Get that calf back
to the barn!

25:40.408 --> 25:42.758
Boys, I want you to get
after those fucking wolves.

25:53.943 --> 25:55.728
Hey, little fella.
You get lost?

25:58.426 --> 25:59.819
How you doing?

26:14.355 --> 26:15.835
Got the legs.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.498
You from here?

27:10.585 --> 27:11.717
Nobody's from here.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.416
Is there an
event this weekend?

27:15.503 --> 27:16.635
Just another Tuesday.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.951
Press conference
starts at three o'clock.

27:29.038 --> 27:31.258
I can put it on
the TVs down here.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.652
We don't want him
on TVs down here.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.437
Ah. Great.

27:38.265 --> 27:40.397
You're aware of
the press conference?

27:40.484 --> 27:42.661
Going to watch it now.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.228
Great.
We'll watch with you.

27:55.499 --> 27:56.413
Right this way.

28:08.164 --> 28:11.254
If you're gonna look,
be man enough to stare.

28:14.562 --> 28:16.085
Not there yet, I guess.

28:16.172 --> 28:18.131
I don't mind, really.

28:18.218 --> 28:19.915
Is this a test?

28:20.002 --> 28:21.700
It's an opportunity.
You missed it.

28:25.573 --> 28:28.097
- It's through here?
- Uhh, [clears throat] yes.

28:28.184 --> 28:29.316
Yes, ma'am.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.756
Ah, just in time.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.279
Dutton called
a press conference.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.499
He's going
to pull our funding.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.544
That's been announced?

28:40.631 --> 28:43.112
It was his campaign slogan.

29:12.489 --> 29:13.447
Let me see.

29:21.281 --> 29:22.282
Good.

29:26.416 --> 29:29.419
As the State's attorney,
I must inform you

29:29.506 --> 29:30.943
that by signing this order

29:31.030 --> 29:32.683
you are signing
a declaration of war.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.207
Really?

29:34.294 --> 29:36.078
As we speak,
they are raping the land

29:36.165 --> 29:38.298
our family has bled
into for over a century.

29:40.691 --> 29:42.345
We're already at war.

29:53.313 --> 29:54.357
Good afternoon.

30:04.977 --> 30:07.240
Freedom.

30:07.327 --> 30:09.677
Been thinking a lot
about that lately.

30:11.331 --> 30:13.115
The word, what it means.

30:15.204 --> 30:16.640
The dictionary
thinks that it means

30:16.727 --> 30:20.253
"The power or
right to think, speak, or act

30:20.340 --> 30:24.561
as one wants without
hindrance or restraint."

30:24.648 --> 30:27.782
As Governor of this State, I am
sworn to protect that right.

30:29.915 --> 30:33.570
<i>Building a city in the middle
of our most pristine wilderness</i>

30:33.657 --> 30:36.095
<i>strips you of that freedom.</i>

30:36.182 --> 30:38.271
<i>It eliminates your
freedom to breathe clean air</i>

30:38.358 --> 30:40.142
<i>and drink clean water.</i>

30:40.229 --> 30:41.404
It strains the ability
of our schools,

30:41.491 --> 30:44.320
our hospitals and our police.

30:44.407 --> 30:46.670
That requires an
increase in our taxes

30:46.757 --> 30:48.672
which in turns
strains our families,

30:48.759 --> 30:51.719
forcing you to decide
if you can even afford

30:51.806 --> 30:56.115
to live in a place
that you call home.

30:56.202 --> 30:57.899
That's not progress
in my mind.

30:59.727 --> 31:00.771
That's an invasion.

31:02.077 --> 31:03.818
And the invasion is over.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.428
Today, I am signing an
Executive order

31:05.515 --> 31:07.561
<i>that ceases all
state funding for</i>

31:07.648 --> 31:09.737
<i>the Paradise Valley
development project,</i>

31:09.824 --> 31:11.260
<i>the Airport
development project,</i>

31:11.347 --> 31:13.610
<i>and the paradise
Valley Ski Resort.</i>

31:13.697 --> 31:14.916
<i>All state permits are revoked.</i>

31:41.987 --> 31:43.989
Thank you for your time today.

31:44.076 --> 31:46.034
Enjoy the rest of it.

31:49.733 --> 31:50.865
There'll be
no questions today.

31:57.132 --> 31:59.308
And we're right back
where we started.

32:14.889 --> 32:16.978
We're gonna have to
watch out for that one.

32:17.065 --> 32:20.373
Chairman, you can't ever
stop watching that one.

32:25.117 --> 32:26.640
Let's get a cease
and desist

32:26.727 --> 32:29.382
before a judge
by end of day tomorrow.

32:29.469 --> 32:32.602
File suit against the state
for breach of contract,

32:32.689 --> 32:35.388
and negotiating in bad faith,

32:35.475 --> 32:37.520
and anything else
you can think of.

32:43.787 --> 32:46.660
Who is that?

32:46.747 --> 32:50.011
That's Jamie Dutton.
Attorney General.

32:50.098 --> 32:51.665
That's the Governor's son?

32:51.752 --> 32:54.059
Mm-hmm.

32:54.146 --> 32:56.844
This is like doing
business in Utah.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.367
In Utah,
they want to do business.

32:58.454 --> 33:00.804
Here...

33:00.891 --> 33:03.764
Here, they want
the business to go away.

33:03.851 --> 33:06.114
Son doesn't
look up to this fight.

33:06.201 --> 33:08.508
Think I'm gonna start with him.

33:15.036 --> 33:17.517
I love it when she
gets really mad.

33:17.604 --> 33:19.649
It means I'm going to
make a lot of money.

33:34.142 --> 33:37.102
Good afternoon, Miss Dutton.

33:37.189 --> 33:40.105
Mrs.
I'm an honest woman now.

33:40.192 --> 33:43.891
- Beautiful car.
- Doesn't suck.

33:43.978 --> 33:45.675
Bet the payments are steep.

33:45.762 --> 33:48.548
You know, I've learned that
the lease payments have

33:48.635 --> 33:50.289
an inverse relationship to
the length of my skirt.

33:51.899 --> 33:53.727
I don't know what that means.

33:53.814 --> 33:54.945
It means the payments aren't
that steep, buddy.

34:07.175 --> 34:08.959
Sh-sh-sh-sh...

34:33.332 --> 34:36.291
Getting the crash course
in cowboy today, kid.

34:36.378 --> 34:37.945
Yeah. Hope I get another
one tomorrow.

34:38.032 --> 34:39.425
You get one every day.

34:39.512 --> 34:41.296
Now get around that pair
and push 'em up.

34:52.699 --> 34:56.790
Holy shit!

34:56.877 --> 34:58.705
Damn it, kid.
You all right?

34:58.792 --> 34:59.836
What happened?

34:59.923 --> 35:01.360
How's your arm?

35:01.447 --> 35:04.363
- It's nothing.
- Raise it, then.

35:05.929 --> 35:06.930
Then it ain't nothing.

35:07.017 --> 35:08.758
What happened?

35:08.845 --> 35:10.499
Horse fell, I think he
stepped in a hole. I think.

35:10.586 --> 35:12.588
I'm sorry.
I didn't see the hole.

35:12.675 --> 35:13.981
You need to keep one eye
on the cow

35:14.068 --> 35:16.244
and the other one on the ground.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.423
Is the horse gonna be okay?

35:21.510 --> 35:22.424
No, he ain't.

35:26.254 --> 35:28.213
Easy.

35:48.363 --> 35:50.191
You're gonna shoot him?

35:50.278 --> 35:51.323
That leg'll never heal.

35:53.499 --> 35:54.326
I don't need him suffering.

36:05.902 --> 36:08.166
Go on, get back to work.
Get back to work.

36:18.654 --> 36:20.352
I'm sorry.

36:20.439 --> 36:21.483
I bet you are.

36:22.919 --> 36:23.616
I'm sorry, too.

36:25.226 --> 36:28.142
Now take that bridle
and that saddle,

36:28.229 --> 36:30.275
and walk it back
to the barn.

36:33.582 --> 36:34.322
Lloyd, help him out.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.293
One, two, three.

37:12.491 --> 37:13.492
- Hey, Glade?
- Yeah.

37:13.579 --> 37:14.754
Would you
get me another?

37:14.841 --> 37:16.016
Yeah.

37:20.673 --> 37:21.500
There you go.

37:22.892 --> 37:24.416
God bless you.

37:26.983 --> 37:30.160
- Can I get a beer?
- What do you want?

37:30.248 --> 37:32.728
Let me get a Trout Slayer.

37:32.815 --> 37:33.512
Coming up.

37:35.601 --> 37:36.950
Care for a Trout Slayer?

37:38.865 --> 37:42.521
That what you been doing,
slayin' trout?

37:42.608 --> 37:44.523
Mountain biking, actually.

37:44.610 --> 37:46.264
I'm not much of a fisherman.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.570
You ride bikes?

37:48.657 --> 37:50.268
Not since I was seven.

37:54.533 --> 37:56.665
Didn't expect to see
a dress like that in Montana.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.887
Yeah, well, I'm working.

38:00.974 --> 38:02.236
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

38:02.323 --> 38:03.977
What kind of work?

38:04.064 --> 38:07.023
Buddy, this is your
one chance to leave me alone

38:07.110 --> 38:08.634
with your self esteem intact.

38:10.331 --> 38:11.550
Give me your best shot.

38:15.641 --> 38:17.730
You're a professor.
Somewhere fancy.

38:17.817 --> 38:20.123
Northwestern.

38:20.210 --> 38:22.996
You've got a couple of
grown kids,

38:23.083 --> 38:25.433
and once they left the house
your wife divorced you

38:25.520 --> 38:27.348
so fast she left
fucking skid marks,

38:27.435 --> 38:30.612
but how nice for you, huh?

38:30.699 --> 38:33.049
Let me guess:
world went a little wacko,

38:33.136 --> 38:35.443
no longer cool
to boink the co-eds,

38:35.530 --> 38:37.663
so you decided fuck this city.

38:37.750 --> 38:39.795
Got a nice
little place in Bozeman,

38:39.882 --> 38:41.971
'cause it's your favorite
place to ski.

38:42.058 --> 38:45.148
Now you teach classes on
Zoom from the living room

38:45.235 --> 38:47.455
of your creekside cabin

38:47.542 --> 38:50.676
And you lecture about inequity
and the concentration of wealth

38:50.763 --> 38:52.547
that how it's decimating
the middle class

38:52.634 --> 38:55.942
all while you draw your six
figure salary

38:56.029 --> 38:59.554
and finance your dream home
with a loan from the university

38:59.641 --> 39:03.906
that's 275 basis points below
the loans that your students

39:03.993 --> 39:05.865
need to take out to listen
to this bullshit.

39:05.952 --> 39:07.606
And my guess, if I had to guess

39:07.693 --> 39:09.869
is that you paid over
asking price

39:09.956 --> 39:12.567
for it because it's fucking
monopoly money to you, isn't it?

39:12.654 --> 39:15.004
So you run up
house prices here

39:15.091 --> 39:18.573
and you fuck the middle classes
in two states.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.054
Bravo, you fucking hypocrite.

39:22.751 --> 39:24.797
Fuck you.

39:24.884 --> 39:27.582
Not for all the tea
in China, pencil dick.

39:33.675 --> 39:35.895
Fuckin' love this bar.

39:35.982 --> 39:37.462
Your guests have arrived.

39:37.549 --> 39:39.072
Thanks, Glade.

39:43.424 --> 39:44.469
Back to work.

39:52.607 --> 39:54.130
They're right behind you.

39:54.217 --> 39:55.871
John, what the hell was
that press conference?

39:55.958 --> 39:58.787
Governor Perry and
your son pushed this thing

39:58.874 --> 40:00.920
down our throat
and now you shut it down?

40:01.007 --> 40:03.879
Well, you really want 30,000
people from the Bay Area

40:03.966 --> 40:06.229
running up and down
highway 89, Ronnie?

40:06.316 --> 40:09.711
Putting up a Starbucks
where your fly shop is?

40:09.798 --> 40:11.191
We're well past want, John.

40:11.278 --> 40:12.758
Do you understand
the tax revenue

40:12.845 --> 40:14.629
that you just took
from this county?

40:14.716 --> 40:16.936
The hotel tax alone
is a hundred million.

40:17.023 --> 40:19.199
Not to mention the airport tax,
the car rental tax.

40:19.286 --> 40:23.116
Where are you going to spend
all that money, Kyle?

40:23.203 --> 40:25.118
Hm? You're going to have
to double the size

40:25.205 --> 40:27.903
of the Sheriff's department,
emergency services.

40:27.990 --> 40:31.298
Where do you treat the sewage
six thousand homes create?

40:31.385 --> 40:33.169
Is there a treatment plant
in the valley

40:33.256 --> 40:34.736
that I don't know about?

40:34.823 --> 40:36.085
I will increase your
tax revenue

40:36.172 --> 40:38.784
without adding one structure
to this valley, all right?

40:38.871 --> 40:40.176
Without one new road.

40:40.263 --> 40:42.701
Doubling property tax
on non-residents?

40:42.788 --> 40:45.312
It'll never work.
They'll just become residents.

40:45.399 --> 40:46.574
No, they won't.

40:46.661 --> 40:47.836
If they could've
become residents,

40:47.923 --> 40:49.751
they would have by now.

40:49.838 --> 40:51.927
New York and California,
they do not give up

40:52.014 --> 40:54.626
16 percent that easy.

40:54.713 --> 40:57.150
You didn't need our permission
to issue an executive order.

40:57.237 --> 40:59.805
But you do need something.

40:59.892 --> 41:02.677
Deny their request to rezone.

41:02.764 --> 41:05.898
Without the state's support,
there's no reason to give it.

41:05.985 --> 41:08.988
A lot of people in this valley
support that airport, John.

41:09.075 --> 41:12.034
A lot of people from
out of state support it.

41:12.121 --> 41:13.906
People with no vote.

41:13.993 --> 41:16.604
They may not have a vote,
but they have money.

41:16.691 --> 41:19.041
And they give it to the people
who support their agendas.

41:19.128 --> 41:21.566
Take a drive down Main Street
in Bozeman, Kyle.

41:23.916 --> 41:27.136
That's what they'll do
to this place and worse.

41:27.223 --> 41:29.356
Our terms are up in
two years, John.

41:29.443 --> 41:31.880
This wound will still
be fresh in two years.

41:31.967 --> 41:33.752
Hell, the state will still be
in litigation in two years.

41:33.839 --> 41:36.276
There will be
no litigation, Ronnie.

41:36.363 --> 41:38.626
And you'll both
still be in office.

41:41.847 --> 41:44.763
When's the last time
a governor gave you his word?

41:44.850 --> 41:45.807
Never.

41:47.809 --> 41:48.506
Well, you have mine.

41:50.812 --> 41:53.815
Andy will vote to approve,
no matter what we do.

41:53.902 --> 41:55.904
That's why Andy
is not sitting here.

41:58.907 --> 42:00.692
I only need two votes.

42:00.779 --> 42:02.258
Do I have them?

42:06.306 --> 42:10.005
Once you deny their
re-zoning request,

42:10.092 --> 42:12.094
I'm revoking their lease
on our land.

42:12.181 --> 42:14.749
I'm placing the ranch in
a conservation easement.

42:14.836 --> 42:18.144
There'll be nothing to litigate.

42:18.231 --> 42:20.712
Should've just told me
that from the beginning.

42:20.799 --> 42:22.975
We'll issue the denial tomorrow.

42:34.203 --> 42:35.640
Dad...

42:35.727 --> 42:37.293
Yeah?

42:37.380 --> 42:38.860
If you put the land
in a conservation easement,

42:38.947 --> 42:40.645
we have no moves.

42:40.732 --> 42:45.171
We can't sell off a piece
to cover losses or taxes.

42:45.258 --> 42:47.739
We can't ever develop it,
and neither can anyone else.

42:47.826 --> 42:49.218
Exactly.

42:49.305 --> 42:52.221
Dad, we could lose
the whole thing.

42:52.308 --> 42:57.531
But it'll be whole, honey.
It'll be whole.

42:57.618 --> 42:59.359
And that matters more than
any name on a deed.

43:04.277 --> 43:05.757
We'll worry about
who runs things when...

43:08.150 --> 43:09.369
when that's a worry.

43:52.412 --> 43:54.632
Wasn't expecting you.

43:54.719 --> 43:55.763
I wish you would have called,

43:55.850 --> 43:56.938
I would have had
supper prepared.

43:57.025 --> 43:58.984
Yeah.
I'll get by with a sandwich.

44:00.289 --> 44:00.986
How's the herd?

44:02.552 --> 44:03.466
Wolves got
into the pairs in pasture nine.

44:03.553 --> 44:05.338
So I moved 'em to the barn.

44:05.425 --> 44:08.558
Got Ryan and Colby
out there hunting them now.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.996
You need depredation tags.

44:11.083 --> 44:13.738
Yeah, we got 'em.

44:13.825 --> 44:17.916
Um, the boy, he got
in an accident.

44:18.003 --> 44:20.483
It was on your horse.

44:20.570 --> 44:22.094
Is the boy okay?

44:22.181 --> 44:24.574
Broke his arm.
He'll survive.

44:24.662 --> 44:28.187
But... the horse
wasn't as lucky.

44:28.274 --> 44:31.146
He stepped in a badger hole
and shattered his leg,

44:31.233 --> 44:33.018
so... I had to put him down.

44:35.890 --> 44:40.068
I'm sorry, sir,
it's my fault.

44:40.155 --> 44:44.072
Riding is what the
horse is for, Rip.

44:44.159 --> 44:48.555
Could've stepped in a badger
hole turned out just as easy.

44:57.303 --> 44:59.522
Thought y'all were in Helena.

44:59.609 --> 45:03.309
I manipulated the wheels of
government so I could see you.

45:05.093 --> 45:07.705
How long you here for?

45:07.792 --> 45:09.228
We leave in the morning.

45:12.797 --> 45:15.800
Gotta fill a week's worth
of loving into eight hours.

45:19.978 --> 45:21.762
Hope you weren't
planning on sleeping.

45:39.780 --> 45:41.782
Got 'em.

45:41.869 --> 45:42.870
Fire on three, two, one.

45:44.480 --> 45:46.787
Three, two, one.

45:55.317 --> 45:56.275
Safe.

46:32.354 --> 46:34.226
Oh, fuck.

46:34.313 --> 46:37.359
Uh, these wolves
are from the park.

46:47.543 --> 46:49.328
Fuck!

46:49.415 --> 46:51.504
What do we do?

46:51.591 --> 46:53.941
If those radio collars are
motionless for twelve hours

46:54.028 --> 46:56.596
they send out
a distress signal,

46:56.683 --> 46:58.119
then there's 15 Game Wardens
standing in this field

46:58.206 --> 46:59.468
in the morning
and you and I

46:59.555 --> 47:00.643
are on the fucking
news tomorrow night.

47:00.730 --> 47:01.731
So what do we do?

47:01.819 --> 47:03.255
We gotta get these collars off

47:03.342 --> 47:05.170
and keep them moving
until I figure this out.

47:05.257 --> 47:07.563
So what you wanna do is jog
them around in a fucking circle?

47:07.650 --> 47:09.304
These wolves have
fucking Facebook pages.

47:09.391 --> 47:11.916
People walk around in t-shirts
with their pictures on them.

47:12.003 --> 47:13.526
People find out that
we killed them,

47:13.613 --> 47:15.354
on the Governor's ranch?

47:16.790 --> 47:18.879
We have tags.
It's legal.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.146
Son of a bitch.

48:02.792 --> 48:04.098
It's over here, sir.

48:11.801 --> 48:14.065
There's another dead elk over
there somewhere, too.

48:18.896 --> 48:20.419
There's something
in the water.

48:21.420 --> 48:23.161
Let's go.

48:23.248 --> 48:23.944
Come on, Lloyd!

48:37.305 --> 48:38.524
Put me down.

49:11.296 --> 49:12.558
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

49:21.088 --> 49:22.916
What are you spraying it with?

49:23.003 --> 49:24.744
- Paraquat for the weeds.
- What?

49:24.831 --> 49:26.659
Some kind of pyrethroid
for mosquitos.

49:30.793 --> 49:32.447
That's my ranch down there.

49:35.233 --> 49:38.192
Whatever you're spraying
it with it's in the creek now

49:38.279 --> 49:40.673
and it's killing my cattle.

49:40.760 --> 49:42.631
It's killing everything.

49:42.718 --> 49:45.330
I'm licensed to spray it.
These are EPA approved.

49:45.417 --> 49:46.984
I don't give a shit
who approved it.

49:47.071 --> 49:48.986
It's killing my cattle.

49:49.073 --> 49:50.770
Take it up with the EPA.

49:50.857 --> 49:53.077
Phone company says put in a
cell tower, that's what we do...

49:53.164 --> 49:54.339
I can't get a bulldozer up here.

49:54.426 --> 49:55.862
It's the top of a mountain.

49:55.949 --> 49:56.689
This is the only way
to clear it.

49:56.776 --> 49:58.778
EPA says it's harmless.

49:58.865 --> 50:00.258
It's killing my cattle.

50:00.345 --> 50:01.781
Take it up with
the phone company.

50:01.868 --> 50:03.217
You're cattle aren't my problem.

50:03.304 --> 50:04.566
Got a card?

50:14.446 --> 50:17.275
Why am I not surprised?

50:20.756 --> 50:21.801
Hey.

50:23.237 --> 50:25.544
All right, let's go.

51:52.500 --> 51:53.893
Woo!

52:26.273 --> 52:27.274
What the fuck?

52:39.373 --> 52:41.027
Hello?

52:48.513 --> 52:50.123
Hey!

53:22.111 --> 53:23.591
Fuck.

54:06.591 --> 54:09.158
You still awake?

54:09.246 --> 54:11.857
Yeah.

54:11.944 --> 54:13.250
You should be plum wore out.

54:15.252 --> 54:16.644
Mm. Just thinking.

54:20.082 --> 54:21.301
Good thoughts?

54:22.955 --> 54:25.000
No, not really.

54:32.791 --> 54:34.183
Yeah?

54:46.152 --> 54:49.677
Why in the hell did you shoot
the ones with the collars?

54:49.764 --> 54:52.245
We were using thermal.
We couldn't see the collars.

54:52.332 --> 54:53.464
Is that right?

54:53.551 --> 54:54.987
Well, start taking
the collars off.

54:55.074 --> 54:56.815
We're taking them with us.

54:56.902 --> 54:58.599
These things record every
step these wolves make,

54:58.686 --> 55:00.384
So we're gonna have to
move like a wolf pack.

55:00.471 --> 55:02.168
I want you to take one
and put it in your saddle bag

55:02.255 --> 55:04.344
and I want you to take the other
and put it in front of you

55:04.431 --> 55:06.738
while you ride.
- Where we going?

55:06.825 --> 55:08.392
Back in the park.

55:27.236 --> 55:28.325
That's good.

55:31.937 --> 55:34.679
No, no, no, Ryan.
Not that tight.

55:34.766 --> 55:36.550
They need to come
off somewhere.

55:38.552 --> 55:39.379
That's good.

55:46.604 --> 55:50.564
Listen up, you don't tell
a fucking soul. Ever.

55:50.651 --> 55:52.479
This never happened.

55:52.566 --> 55:54.089
Who am I gonna tell?

55:54.176 --> 55:57.441
That could put me in jail
for a fucking decade.

55:57.528 --> 55:59.617
Ryan, next time don't
shoot the ones

55:59.704 --> 56:00.835
with the GPS beacons on them.

56:32.389 --> 56:34.608
- Morning.
- Morning.

56:44.139 --> 56:46.185
I've never seen
anything like it.

56:47.621 --> 56:49.710
Well, there
isn't anything like it.

56:51.886 --> 56:52.931
Where does it end?

56:56.151 --> 56:57.196
Well...

57:00.242 --> 57:01.287
Well, you can't...

57:03.463 --> 57:04.638
You can't see that from here.

57:07.946 --> 57:10.731
Can't imagine what it takes
to maintain this place.

57:10.818 --> 57:12.690
Takes everything, Clara.

57:14.518 --> 57:18.217
It takes everything
we've got.

57:18.304 --> 57:19.305
Come on.

58:24.936 --> 58:27.678
Next time on an
all-new <i>Yellowstone.</i>

58:27.765 --> 58:31.333
Find a way
to ruin this family.

58:31.420 --> 58:33.422
Turn her loose.

58:33.510 --> 58:36.861
My vision told me I'd have
to choose, so I'm choosing.

58:36.948 --> 58:39.733
This ain't easy, Kayce.

58:39.820 --> 58:41.343
We have no choice
but to fight.

58:41.430 --> 58:42.780
We can remove him.

58:42.867 --> 58:43.650
You mean we can
martyr him?

58:43.737 --> 58:46.914
I'm going to teach you
the master rules

58:47.001 --> 58:49.090
and that lesson
will not be pleasant.
