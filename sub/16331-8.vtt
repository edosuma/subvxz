00:03.743 --> 00:05.143
<i> (thunk)</i>
<i> (grunt)</i>

00:05.145 --> 00:08.846
DOMINIC:
Oh, (bleep). Oh, shit!

00:10.250 --> 00:12.316
What the (bleep)
was that?

00:13.620 --> 00:15.720
You know what that was.

00:15.722 --> 00:19.490
Dominic... you've played
this scene before.

00:19.492 --> 00:22.093
I did not sign up
for this shit!

00:22.095 --> 00:24.162
Sidney said if... if I
played a-a good villain,

00:24.164 --> 00:25.930
I'd get my
own spin-off.

00:25.932 --> 00:28.332
I am not getting killed
over no damn TV show.

00:28.334 --> 00:30.168
Do you hear me, Sidney?

00:30.170 --> 00:32.503
Get us the (bleep)
out of here!

00:33.640 --> 00:35.139
Sidney's not coming.

00:35.141 --> 00:38.009
Nobody is coming.

00:38.011 --> 00:41.312
You don't know
what those monsters can do.

00:44.250 --> 00:45.783
Oh, shit.

00:45.785 --> 00:47.785
Oh, (bleep)!

00:47.787 --> 00:49.320
Look at that.

00:49.322 --> 00:52.857
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

00:52.859 --> 00:55.326
This is insane. This is insane.

00:55.328 --> 00:58.029
Oh, no.

00:58.031 --> 01:00.131
Oh, sh-shit!

01:00.133 --> 01:02.133
What are we going to do?

01:02.135 --> 01:04.602
What are we gonna do,
Shelby?

01:04.604 --> 01:07.238
The tunnel.
Come on.

01:09.275 --> 01:12.510
Keep your eyes open--
they could already be inside.

01:21.187 --> 01:23.721
(door opens)

01:23.723 --> 01:25.790
(door closes)

01:36.035 --> 01:37.235
(whispering):
Shelby...

01:37.237 --> 01:39.303
Shelby.

01:39.305 --> 01:40.905
Shelby, Shelby.

01:40.907 --> 01:42.807
We have to go.
Shelby.

01:42.809 --> 01:45.209
Shelby, we have to go.
Come on.

01:45.211 --> 01:47.211
Come on, Shelby.
Come on.

01:47.213 --> 01:49.714
Come on. Flashlight.

01:49.716 --> 01:51.782
Flashlight.

02:05.164 --> 02:06.530
Ah! There's something...

02:06.532 --> 02:08.232
There's something.

02:08.234 --> 02:10.167
It might be Edward.

02:10.169 --> 02:12.236
He actually
could help.

02:14.507 --> 02:16.707
What the (bleep)
is that?

02:16.709 --> 02:18.276
It's the Chens.

02:19.345 --> 02:21.345
Oh, shit.
No, no, no!

02:21.347 --> 02:22.480
(screams)

02:32.725 --> 02:36.093
To make real thin slices...

02:36.095 --> 02:38.829
your edge got to be sharp
as a razor.

02:40.033 --> 02:43.768
Slide the blade
against the stone like this.

02:43.770 --> 02:45.836
JETHER:
It's awake.

02:51.044 --> 02:53.110
(thump)
Pay attention!

02:53.112 --> 02:55.146
I'm doing this for your sake.

02:55.148 --> 02:57.415
Now, which part of it

02:57.417 --> 02:58.916
tastes the best?

02:58.918 --> 03:01.152
I'm not an "it."
I'm a human being.

03:01.154 --> 03:04.922
I don't remember,
Mama.

03:04.924 --> 03:06.123
You set that
damn thing down.

03:06.125 --> 03:08.292
Why the hell you always
taking pictures?

03:08.294 --> 03:09.961
Me and Lot
play it back for fun.

03:09.963 --> 03:11.929
Mm-hmm. And do you

03:11.931 --> 03:15.132
touch your privates
while you watch?

03:15.134 --> 03:18.336
Now, you take this knife here

03:18.338 --> 03:20.905
and just cut your mama

03:20.907 --> 03:22.340
some nice

03:22.342 --> 03:24.342
filet.

03:24.344 --> 03:25.810
Please don't do this.

03:25.812 --> 03:28.279
People don't eat people.

03:28.281 --> 03:30.281
If you ain't Polk...

03:30.283 --> 03:32.183
You ain't people.

03:32.185 --> 03:34.919
That's right, Jether.

03:34.921 --> 03:36.587
Tell it our
family history.

03:36.589 --> 03:39.290
(scoffs) I ain't good
at old stories, Mama.

03:39.292 --> 03:41.125
Oh, come on, now.

03:41.127 --> 03:43.194
Here you are.

03:48.134 --> 03:49.600
It was the depression.

03:49.602 --> 03:52.603
1929.

03:52.605 --> 03:54.638
Everybody
was broke.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.874
Weren't nothing
for nobody to eat.

03:56.876 --> 03:59.176
Only thing plentiful

03:59.178 --> 04:01.278
were the itinerant hobos.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.147
They was on our land.

04:03.149 --> 04:05.349
Stealing what
little we had.

04:05.351 --> 04:07.351
They slaughtered
our last pig.

04:07.353 --> 04:11.222
Had themselves a nice meal.

04:11.224 --> 04:15.059
And my kin caught the thieves.

04:15.061 --> 04:17.461
And they looked at 'em

04:17.463 --> 04:19.730
and their full bellies

04:19.732 --> 04:22.333
and they decided our family--

04:22.335 --> 04:25.703
hey-- our family...

04:25.705 --> 04:29.640
was never gonna go hungry again.

04:29.642 --> 04:33.377
And that's when
we had<i> our</i> feast.

04:33.379 --> 04:35.780
(slurping)

04:39.085 --> 04:42.019
We found our power.

04:42.021 --> 04:45.756
And our place.

04:45.758 --> 04:48.059
We knew then...

04:48.061 --> 04:50.061
The Polks weren't like
any other.

04:50.063 --> 04:52.163
We were the...
only family.

04:52.165 --> 04:54.598
First family.
We were the first family.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.567
And we always will be,

04:56.569 --> 04:59.703
so long as we keep up
traditions.

04:59.705 --> 05:03.240
They have the death penalty
in North Carolina--

05:03.242 --> 05:07.445
you're all gonna die
when they catch you.

05:07.447 --> 05:09.046
Police been in our pockets

05:09.048 --> 05:11.182
for years now.

05:17.190 --> 05:19.190
We pay 'em better than
the state ever could.

05:19.192 --> 05:21.926
(laughs)

05:24.964 --> 05:27.164
(sighs)

05:28.935 --> 05:31.001
What are you gonna
do with that?

05:31.871 --> 05:33.270
Cauterize
your thigh

05:33.272 --> 05:35.439
after Jether takes
a chunk out of it.

05:35.441 --> 05:37.074
Jesus!

05:37.076 --> 05:38.576
Wouldn't do to have
you bleedin' out

05:38.578 --> 05:40.311
before we finish
taking prime cuts.

05:40.313 --> 05:42.279
(shrieks)

05:42.281 --> 05:44.849
(screaming)

05:54.660 --> 05:57.294
Can I have some water, please?

06:00.099 --> 06:02.233
What is that?

06:07.173 --> 06:10.241
(groans)

06:10.243 --> 06:12.276
You cut off my ear.

06:12.278 --> 06:13.811
It's a present.

06:13.813 --> 06:15.746
For Christmas.

06:15.748 --> 06:18.149
It's the best day
of the year.

06:18.151 --> 06:21.152
We each get
a pickled ear.

06:21.154 --> 06:23.254
A bag of Mentho-lyptus.

06:23.256 --> 06:26.023
Jar of black strap molasses.

06:26.025 --> 06:29.093
More ammo.

06:29.095 --> 06:32.029
The babies do
cuddles with Mama.

06:32.031 --> 06:34.532
I'm too old for that.

06:34.534 --> 06:37.334
Lot gets her bed, but...

06:37.336 --> 06:39.803
he say I'm too young.

06:39.805 --> 06:41.939
I'm caught dab
in the middle.

06:50.816 --> 06:53.484
Why are you crying?

06:53.486 --> 06:57.087
I want another
Christmas with Flora.

06:58.324 --> 07:00.224
Is she your kin?

07:00.226 --> 07:02.893
My daughter.

07:02.895 --> 07:04.962
You love her?

07:07.900 --> 07:09.700
Of course.

07:09.702 --> 07:13.170
Every mother
loves their children.

07:13.172 --> 07:14.705
(short chuckle)

07:14.707 --> 07:16.307
Not every mama.

07:16.309 --> 07:18.676
(sniffles)

07:18.678 --> 07:22.546
I wanted to be
on the TV.

07:22.548 --> 07:25.382
Ishmael, Cain, Lot--

07:25.384 --> 07:27.885
they all got to
be in the story.

07:27.887 --> 07:30.187
How do you know about the show?

07:30.189 --> 07:32.056
We're part of
the United States.

07:32.058 --> 07:34.225
We get TV.

07:34.227 --> 07:37.161
They're making a new show.

07:37.163 --> 07:39.430
I'm gonna be on it.

07:39.432 --> 07:41.031
You help me,

07:41.033 --> 07:42.600
I'll get you on TV.

07:42.602 --> 07:44.768
Make you famous.

07:47.206 --> 07:51.041
Only one person ever been
like that in our family.

07:51.043 --> 07:53.611
Kincaid Polk.

07:53.613 --> 07:57.081
He used to take the hogs
to slaughter in Chicago,

07:57.083 --> 07:59.250
where the
stockyard was.

07:59.252 --> 08:01.352
Then came the
World's Fair.

08:01.354 --> 08:03.354
1800-something.

08:03.356 --> 08:06.357
That's when the
Piggy Man was born.

08:07.426 --> 08:09.293
After slaughtering
the hogs,

08:09.295 --> 08:12.363
he'd put on a pig mask
and slaughter people.

08:12.365 --> 08:15.032
Hung 'em up,
gutted and skinned,

08:15.034 --> 08:18.369
upside down
in the bathtub.

08:18.371 --> 08:20.904
He got the idea
from the Others.

08:20.906 --> 08:24.041
He saw what The Butcher
did. (chuckles softly)

08:24.043 --> 08:26.143
Stick a pig head
on that man

08:26.145 --> 08:28.212
and roast him alive.

08:29.548 --> 08:31.548
Made himself a legend.

08:31.550 --> 08:33.784
You can be bigger.

08:33.786 --> 08:36.287
You can be the hero.

08:36.289 --> 08:38.355
Just let me go.

08:48.234 --> 08:51.535
You best put leaving
here out of your mind.

08:53.606 --> 08:56.907
Even I can't leave
if I want to.

08:59.979 --> 09:02.146
I ain't bigger
than Piggy Man.

09:02.148 --> 09:04.682
Never will be!

09:04.684 --> 09:07.017
So shut your mouth!

09:07.019 --> 09:09.186
Shut it!

09:10.790 --> 09:13.757
Don't care to hear
your words no more.

09:40.553 --> 09:42.152
Here.

09:42.154 --> 09:45.222
Mama's coming to take
a piece off your shoulder.

09:45.224 --> 09:47.691
Snort this.
It'll take the edge off.

09:47.693 --> 09:49.626
No, I can't do drugs.

09:49.628 --> 09:51.161
I'm an addict.

09:51.163 --> 09:53.297
I've worked hard
to stay sober.

09:57.703 --> 10:00.537
It doesn't matter, does it?

10:00.539 --> 10:04.174
There's no after
after this.

10:04.176 --> 10:06.310
Why don't you
just kill me?

10:06.312 --> 10:08.812
Why take it
piece by piece?

10:08.814 --> 10:12.082
Tradition mainly.

10:12.084 --> 10:14.852
They didn't have
no icebox back then.

10:14.854 --> 10:17.588
(sniffs)
It was the way
to keep the meat fresh.

10:17.590 --> 10:21.258
But Mama say fear
and exhaustion

10:21.260 --> 10:24.261
gives the jerky
a delicious tang.

10:24.263 --> 10:25.996
So that's it?

10:25.998 --> 10:28.165
I'm gonna die.

10:28.167 --> 10:30.501
(sniffs)
After we take
the best parts,

10:30.503 --> 10:33.170
we make bone broth.

10:34.373 --> 10:37.107
Give me that shit.
(sniffs)

10:37.109 --> 10:39.510
(clears throat)

10:39.512 --> 10:42.246
(snorts)

10:45.584 --> 10:47.751
(quiet chuckle)

10:50.055 --> 10:52.222
(snorts)

10:52.224 --> 10:54.925
(groans)

10:54.927 --> 10:56.994
(fires crackling)

10:59.398 --> 11:01.632
(Dominic grunting)

11:03.235 --> 11:05.602
DOMINIC:
All right, go,
go, go, go, go!

11:05.604 --> 11:07.438
(wood rattling, cracking)

11:07.440 --> 11:08.772
SHELBY: Come on!

11:08.774 --> 11:10.941
(Dominic grunting)

11:15.114 --> 11:16.613
(grunts)

11:21.220 --> 11:23.120
(screams)

11:23.122 --> 11:26.023
(groaning)
SHELBY: Jesus.

11:27.660 --> 11:29.726
(groaning):
(bleep) my hand.

11:29.728 --> 11:31.862
(both panting)

11:34.900 --> 11:37.167
(groaning):
Oh, shit. Oh!

11:37.169 --> 11:38.435
There's so many of them.

11:38.437 --> 11:40.137
How am we gonna
go up against

11:40.139 --> 11:42.573
that paranormal activity shit,
there's no way!

11:42.575 --> 11:44.608
Hey, what's going
on with you?

11:44.610 --> 11:47.911
Hey, stay with me.
What's happening?

11:47.913 --> 11:49.646
We're gonna die in here.
No, no Shelby.

11:49.648 --> 11:51.081
Shelby, stay with me.

11:51.083 --> 11:52.082
We're gonna get out.

11:52.084 --> 11:53.584
You've done it before.

11:53.586 --> 11:56.086
I did it
because I had Matt.
(bleep)

11:56.088 --> 11:58.121
Matt's dead, okay?

11:58.123 --> 12:00.524
Oh, come on, now think!

12:00.526 --> 12:02.993
Shelby, it's the blood moon.
(groans)

12:02.995 --> 12:05.028
(whimpering):
There's got to be some,
some rules

12:05.030 --> 12:07.364
or-or mumbo jumbo
that we can use.

12:07.366 --> 12:08.932
SHELBY:
There's nothing.

12:10.269 --> 12:12.202
There's nothing.
(sighs)

12:15.474 --> 12:18.175
Please.

12:18.177 --> 12:20.511
There's no escape.

12:20.513 --> 12:23.113
(whispering):
Hey, we're gonna get
out of this.

12:23.115 --> 12:25.115
There's so much out there
waiting for us.

12:25.117 --> 12:27.284
I'm gonna get my spin-off.

12:27.286 --> 12:29.653
You're gonna get
your yoga studio.

12:29.655 --> 12:32.956
But we, but we have
to stick together.

12:32.958 --> 12:34.725
And we can do it.

12:34.727 --> 12:36.293
I know we can.

12:36.295 --> 12:39.329
(crying):
You're a really good actor.

12:39.331 --> 12:40.864
(sighs)

12:40.866 --> 12:43.333
You think so?
(laughs)

12:43.335 --> 12:45.035
Okay. All right,
come on, come on.

12:45.037 --> 12:46.904
I got you.

12:46.906 --> 12:48.805
(stabbing sound, pig squealing)
(screaming)

12:48.807 --> 12:50.874
(grunting)

12:50.876 --> 12:53.477
(squealing)
(crying and grunting)

12:54.246 --> 12:57.180
(groaning)

12:57.182 --> 12:59.483
(panting)

12:59.485 --> 13:00.751
(screeching)

13:00.753 --> 13:02.920
(screaming)

13:05.190 --> 13:07.324
(grunting)

13:16.035 --> 13:17.935
(yelling)

13:17.937 --> 13:20.404
(screaming)

13:23.075 --> 13:25.409
(glass shattering)

13:25.411 --> 13:28.111
(Shelby wailing)

13:28.113 --> 13:30.847
(Shelby crying)
Shelby.

13:30.849 --> 13:32.282
Shelby, we, we got to go.

13:32.284 --> 13:34.751
We got to go, Shelby.
Come on. Get up, get up.

13:34.753 --> 13:36.253
Get up, Shelby.

13:36.255 --> 13:38.755
Shelby, come on.

13:38.757 --> 13:40.958
(banging)
(squealing)

13:40.960 --> 13:42.559
SHELBY:
Oh, God.

13:42.561 --> 13:43.927
(grunting and groaning)

13:43.929 --> 13:45.996
(screaming)

13:49.101 --> 13:51.268
(door closing)

13:52.104 --> 13:54.271
(both panting)

13:55.307 --> 13:58.108
(banging)

13:58.110 --> 14:00.277
Come on.
(Shelby muttering)

14:03.449 --> 14:06.917
(whimpering)
(door closes)

14:06.919 --> 14:08.785
(door closing)

14:08.787 --> 14:11.221
(both panting)

14:11.223 --> 14:13.290
(sobbing)

14:16.929 --> 14:18.996
(crying, then laughing)

14:23.268 --> 14:25.736
Aw, Shelby,
this is not funny.

14:25.738 --> 14:27.871
(laughing)

14:28.941 --> 14:31.908
We're back where we started.

14:31.910 --> 14:33.410
(sighs)

14:33.412 --> 14:35.779
I'm counting on you.

14:35.781 --> 14:37.848
Shelby, I need you
to do this.

14:37.850 --> 14:39.483
Stay with me.

14:39.485 --> 14:42.653
Dominic.

14:45.824 --> 14:49.426
I killed the only man
I've ever loved.

14:49.428 --> 14:51.561
(crying)

14:56.001 --> 15:01.338
I took his life...
with my own hands.

15:01.340 --> 15:03.040
(sighs)

15:03.042 --> 15:05.142
(crying)

15:05.144 --> 15:08.378
There's no place left for me.

15:25.864 --> 15:27.364
No, no!

15:27.366 --> 15:29.800
(screaming)

15:40.512 --> 15:42.979
(calling out):
Jether.

15:42.981 --> 15:44.614
Jether!

15:47.086 --> 15:49.219
I have to see Flora.

15:49.221 --> 15:50.987
You can save
your breath.

15:50.989 --> 15:52.255
I can't.

15:52.257 --> 15:53.657
In my pants, back pocket.

15:53.659 --> 15:55.392
There's a picture.

15:57.896 --> 16:00.063
(Jether breathing heavily)

16:19.251 --> 16:22.486
(quietly):
Let me see her.

16:23.956 --> 16:27.624
Let me see her.

16:31.797 --> 16:35.766
My sweet, sweet baby.

16:42.274 --> 16:45.709
I want to talk
to my Flora.

17:04.763 --> 17:06.463
(crying)

17:06.465 --> 17:08.532
(sighs)

17:24.149 --> 17:26.082
(inhales and exhales deeply)

17:26.084 --> 17:27.250
Baby girl.

17:27.252 --> 17:33.156
If by chance you see this,

17:33.158 --> 17:35.125
the first thing
you have to know,

17:35.127 --> 17:37.661
is I love you.

17:37.663 --> 17:40.831
I always will.

17:42.000 --> 17:45.769
You've heard many things
about me this past year,

17:45.771 --> 17:48.905
so I want to tell you
the truth.

17:53.278 --> 17:57.113
I killed Daddy.

17:57.115 --> 18:00.217
That's on me,
and me alone.

18:00.219 --> 18:02.219
No one else helped me.

18:02.221 --> 18:05.856
It's nobody's fault
except mine.

18:07.159 --> 18:10.026
He was gonna take you
away from me,

18:10.028 --> 18:12.696
and I couldn't see my life
going forward that way.

18:17.336 --> 18:22.672
I don't know if one day
you'll forgive me.

18:22.674 --> 18:24.875
I just want you to go on

18:24.877 --> 18:27.744
without the weight
of lies and doubt.

18:27.746 --> 18:31.915
You go on, Flora,
and rise up.

18:33.652 --> 18:36.553
There's nothing
holding you down.

18:36.555 --> 18:38.622
(sighs)

18:42.027 --> 18:45.328
I never done
nothing like that,

18:45.330 --> 18:48.899
kill somebody.

18:48.901 --> 18:51.801
Lot tells me it's just
like butchering a pig.

18:53.705 --> 18:57.774
Mama tells me next time,
it'll be my turn.

19:01.246 --> 19:02.679
You're gonna kill me?

19:02.681 --> 19:05.215
Bust your cherry?

19:05.217 --> 19:09.052
Looking forward to it?
No.

19:09.054 --> 19:11.054
I don't want
to hurt you.

19:11.056 --> 19:13.323
Too late for that.

19:17.562 --> 19:20.297
Come here.

19:27.272 --> 19:29.973
I like you.

19:29.975 --> 19:32.876
I like you, too.

19:38.150 --> 19:40.850
(groaning)

19:48.727 --> 19:52.095
Do you want
to touch me?

19:52.097 --> 19:53.797
I want you to.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.934
(heavy breathing)

19:57.936 --> 20:01.738
I want to tape it
so I can watch later.

20:01.740 --> 20:03.673
I won't show nobody.

20:03.675 --> 20:07.110
(panting)

20:07.112 --> 20:11.281
LEE:
I want to make you feel good.

20:11.283 --> 20:13.249
Let me touch it.

20:13.251 --> 20:17.887
(panting)

20:20.359 --> 20:25.028
(yelling)

20:25.030 --> 20:27.998
(groaning and gasping)

20:28.000 --> 20:30.367
(groaning and gasping)
(groaning)

20:34.973 --> 20:37.507
(airy, guttural breathing)

20:39.611 --> 20:43.680
(Lee groaning)

20:45.617 --> 20:47.450
(yelling)

20:47.452 --> 20:50.653
(panting)

20:50.655 --> 20:52.622
(panting)

20:52.624 --> 20:56.026
(coughs, groaning)

20:56.028 --> 20:59.496
(yelling)

20:59.498 --> 21:01.798
(groans)

21:01.800 --> 21:04.167
(panting)

21:04.169 --> 21:06.403
(whimpering)

21:08.573 --> 21:13.376
I know you are watching,
Sidney, you son of a bitch.

21:13.378 --> 21:15.812
You need to save me.

21:15.814 --> 21:18.314
Help me! I'm dying here.

21:18.316 --> 21:20.150
Why are you doing this?

21:20.152 --> 21:22.085
Why aren't you (bleep)
saving me?!

21:22.087 --> 21:25.388
None of this would have happened
if I just...

21:25.390 --> 21:27.090
if I just walked away.

21:27.092 --> 21:30.326
All I wanted is my own show.

21:30.328 --> 21:33.229
I'm supposed to go to Thailand
next month.

21:33.231 --> 21:35.165
I've never been.

21:35.167 --> 21:36.699
I'm flying first class.

21:36.701 --> 21:39.069
Sidney, I'm so scared.

21:39.071 --> 21:40.537
(crying)

21:40.539 --> 21:42.572
Sidney.

21:42.574 --> 21:45.075
Help me!

21:45.077 --> 21:49.879
(loud panting)

21:49.881 --> 21:52.315
(rumbling)

22:00.592 --> 22:02.125
Why are you doing this?

22:02.127 --> 22:03.927
ISHMAEL:
Oh, what's wrong?
(groaning)

22:03.929 --> 22:06.563
I thought you liked having
your picture took.

22:06.565 --> 22:08.231
You're on that TV show,
mocking our family.

22:08.233 --> 22:10.266
We never meant
to mock anyone.

22:10.268 --> 22:12.769
We're just actors.

22:12.771 --> 22:14.904
We play pretend.

22:14.906 --> 22:16.739
Nothing we do is real!

22:16.741 --> 22:18.241
Our babies was real.

22:18.243 --> 22:20.443
They was took from
us 'cause of you.

22:20.445 --> 22:23.079
That wasn't us.

22:23.081 --> 22:26.082
It wasn't us.
It was Matt and Shelby!

22:26.084 --> 22:28.384
The<i> real</i> Matt and Shelby!

22:28.386 --> 22:30.153
What are you
talking about, huh?

22:30.155 --> 22:32.222
I'm talking about the real
people. We're just actors.

22:32.224 --> 22:34.657
They are the ones who had your
babies taken from you, not us.
Huh?

22:34.659 --> 22:37.160
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
it's them.
Hmm?

22:37.162 --> 22:38.795
It's them
you want, not us.
Hmm?

22:38.797 --> 22:41.131
They're at the house
right now.
Hmm?

22:41.133 --> 22:43.166
We can take you.

22:43.168 --> 22:45.068
We can go in.

22:45.070 --> 22:46.569
We can leave the door unlocked,

22:46.571 --> 22:48.404
and you can go in
and drag 'em out!

22:48.406 --> 22:50.006
Oh, we don't got
to do nothing.

22:50.008 --> 22:52.142
(sobbing)
Blood moon's here.

22:52.144 --> 22:55.111
Oh.
The Others are gonna
get 'em soon enough.

22:55.113 --> 22:56.980
Oh, damn it!

22:56.982 --> 22:59.682
What happened?

22:59.684 --> 23:01.985
Damn thing snapped
right in half.
Huh?

23:01.987 --> 23:04.120
I was almost finished with it!

23:04.122 --> 23:06.523
Goddamn blood moon's
gonna be full tomorrow.

23:06.525 --> 23:09.659
We ain't had a rain
of teeth in forever!

23:09.661 --> 23:12.428
Well, where'd you get
them teeth on that TV show?

23:12.430 --> 23:15.131
Hmm?
Props. They were props.

23:15.133 --> 23:17.667
They weren't real.
It was all pretend.

23:17.669 --> 23:20.036
You think it actually
rains teeth here?

23:20.038 --> 23:24.340
Well, it's a gift
from the Others.

23:24.342 --> 23:27.510
All them that's been sacrificed
over the years.

23:28.647 --> 23:31.447
We think it's those ones.

23:31.449 --> 23:34.851
See, teeth... the only
things that don't burn.

23:34.853 --> 23:39.289
Mama tells us we wear these,
well, we don't burn, either.

23:39.291 --> 23:41.558
Oh, my God.
The Others
leave us alone.

23:41.560 --> 23:43.226
Hey,

23:43.228 --> 23:45.228
you need more teeth?

23:45.230 --> 23:47.497
We got two mouthfuls
of 'em right here.
No!

23:47.499 --> 23:49.065
(laughing)
No, no, no, no. No.

23:49.067 --> 23:51.034
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
No, no, no.

23:51.036 --> 23:53.203
Please, please, no,
don't-don't do this.
(Audrey sobbing and muttering)

23:53.205 --> 23:55.405
Don't do this.
Don't do this.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

23:55.407 --> 23:57.040
No!

23:57.042 --> 23:58.408
(grunts)
(laughing)

23:58.410 --> 23:59.876
Oh! She's a
feisty one!

23:59.878 --> 24:02.512
(men laughing)
No! No!

24:02.514 --> 24:04.247
(crying)

24:04.249 --> 24:05.982
Please. Please
leave her alone.

24:05.984 --> 24:07.850
Leave her alone!
(groaning)

24:07.852 --> 24:10.553
(guttural gasping)
Okay. Okay. Okay.

24:10.555 --> 24:14.023
Aah.
No!

24:14.025 --> 24:15.558
(sobbing)

24:15.560 --> 24:17.227
No. Please.

24:17.229 --> 24:19.195
Oh. She got some
pretty ones in there.

24:19.197 --> 24:20.830
Here you go.
Pass me them pliers.

24:20.832 --> 24:23.700
Yeah.
AUDREY:
Please, please don't hurt her.

24:23.702 --> 24:25.602
Please don't do this.
(sobbing)

24:25.604 --> 24:28.238
Don't do this! Please.
(screaming)

24:28.240 --> 24:30.907
Please, don't do this.

24:30.909 --> 24:33.743
Oh, no!

24:33.745 --> 24:35.545
(man laughing)

24:35.547 --> 24:37.614
AUDREY:
Oh, my God.

24:37.616 --> 24:39.449
Are you all right?

24:39.451 --> 24:41.851
Oh, damn it! They broke.

24:41.853 --> 24:43.386
(Ishmael laughing)

24:43.388 --> 24:46.289
Just standing there
laughing for? Get her up!

24:46.291 --> 24:49.259
(laughing)
I got to go get the big pair.

24:49.261 --> 24:50.893
(laughing)

24:50.895 --> 24:52.528
AUDREY:
Where is he going?
Come on.

24:52.530 --> 24:54.197
Get up. Huh? Get up.
No! No! No! No! No!

24:54.199 --> 24:55.632
Yeah, get up. Get up.

24:55.634 --> 24:57.600
(blows landing,
Monet groaning)
Oh! Oh!

24:57.602 --> 24:59.535
(crying):
Ow!

24:59.537 --> 25:01.771
(groaning)
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

25:01.773 --> 25:03.273
Help me. Help me.

25:03.275 --> 25:05.275
MAMA POLK:
How could you break
the damn chair?

25:05.277 --> 25:08.378
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me, Monet.

25:08.380 --> 25:10.580
I'll come back.
I'll come back!

25:10.582 --> 25:13.216
Please don't leave me.
(groaning)

25:13.218 --> 25:16.619
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.

25:16.621 --> 25:19.589
(crying):
I'm gonna die.
No, no, no, no.

25:19.591 --> 25:22.392
What the hell's
going on in here?

25:22.394 --> 25:24.060
Where's the other one?

25:24.062 --> 25:26.062
It got away!

25:26.064 --> 25:28.564
(panting)

25:28.566 --> 25:30.600
What are you
standing around for?

25:30.602 --> 25:32.735
Go get it!
Come on.

25:32.737 --> 25:34.737
Go! Go!
Come on. Come on.

25:34.739 --> 25:36.339
Go!

25:36.341 --> 25:38.641
(Audrey pants loudly)

25:38.643 --> 25:39.909
(door closes)

25:39.911 --> 25:41.911
No, no, no, no.

25:41.913 --> 25:43.346
I wasn't doing anything.

25:43.348 --> 25:45.114
I was just sitting here,
I swear to God.

25:45.116 --> 25:47.350
(breathing loudly)

25:47.352 --> 25:49.686
Open up.
What?

25:50.922 --> 25:53.423
My boys need teeth.

25:53.425 --> 25:57.160
You can open your mouth,
or I can open it for you.

25:57.162 --> 25:59.595
I paid good money
for these teeth.

25:59.597 --> 26:02.165
(spits)

26:02.167 --> 26:04.600
Ah. Still got
some fire in you.

26:04.602 --> 26:08.204
(crying)

26:08.206 --> 26:10.506
It's good. Keep
you alive longer.

26:10.508 --> 26:12.842
Oh, burn in hell!

26:12.844 --> 26:15.211
You should be thanking me
that this is your end,

26:15.213 --> 26:19.515
else you'd be strung up
like that boy in the tree.

26:19.517 --> 26:21.718
You did that!

26:21.720 --> 26:23.686
Did you do that?!

26:23.688 --> 26:26.989
Oh, now, baby, we wouldn't have
wasted good meat like that.

26:26.991 --> 26:29.659
Oh, don't you dare
talk about Rory!

26:29.661 --> 26:32.462
You're not even good enough
to say his name!

26:32.464 --> 26:34.030
You're nothing more
than a bunch

26:34.032 --> 26:37.133
of pig (bleep)
psychopaths!

26:37.135 --> 26:40.703
We don't have relations
with our animals.

26:40.705 --> 26:42.338
It's forbidden.

26:42.340 --> 26:44.140
Bullshit.

26:44.142 --> 26:47.410
How else do you think you got
those deformed monstrosities

26:47.412 --> 26:49.512
you call sons,
you twat?!

26:49.514 --> 26:51.247
Filthy whore!
(groans)

26:51.249 --> 26:55.184
(yelling)
Don't you dare talk
about my babies!

26:55.186 --> 26:57.487
(yells)
I can mangle your face!

26:57.489 --> 27:01.891
(guttural panting)
Or you could open
your goddamn mouth!

27:01.893 --> 27:04.560
Oh, my God.

27:04.562 --> 27:08.164
Open it.
(whimpering)

27:08.166 --> 27:11.234
Ow!

27:11.236 --> 27:13.269
(yelling
and crying)
Mm.

27:13.271 --> 27:16.939
That's nice.

27:16.941 --> 27:19.409
(crickets chirping)

27:21.212 --> 27:22.178
ISHMAEL:
Hey.

27:22.180 --> 27:24.747
We're gonna get
you, girl!

27:24.749 --> 27:28.184
(laughing)

27:28.186 --> 27:31.220
(crickets chirping)

27:31.222 --> 27:33.556
What the hell you doing?

27:33.558 --> 27:36.125
Bring the camera back up!
It's around here somewhere.

27:36.127 --> 27:38.261
You better be filming
when I catch it.

27:38.263 --> 27:40.096
(branch snaps)

27:40.098 --> 27:41.764
Hey, there it is!
(whimpering)

27:41.766 --> 27:43.699
Go get it! (laughing)

27:43.701 --> 27:45.768
(whooping)

27:45.770 --> 27:47.703
(Monet screaming)
Go and get it.

27:47.705 --> 27:50.139
Get it! Get it! Get it!
(Monet whimpering)

27:50.141 --> 27:52.942
(laughing)

27:52.944 --> 27:55.445
(groans)
Give me your mouth.

27:55.447 --> 27:57.046
(groans)

27:57.048 --> 27:59.382
All right, open up.

27:59.384 --> 28:00.883
(muttering)

28:00.885 --> 28:03.085
LEE:
Hey, Mama?
(grunts)

28:03.087 --> 28:04.887
(thudding)

28:04.889 --> 28:08.157
Lee? (panting)

28:08.159 --> 28:10.460
Oh, my God.

28:10.462 --> 28:12.595
You evil bitch!

28:12.597 --> 28:15.164
Oh, my God, Lee.

28:15.166 --> 28:17.667
(crying)
Thank you.

28:17.669 --> 28:19.268
Thank God for you.
Shh.

28:19.270 --> 28:21.904
Thank God for you.
Thank God for you.

28:21.906 --> 28:25.241
Shh.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

28:25.243 --> 28:30.146
Oh, my God.

28:30.148 --> 28:32.782
Oh. Lee, my God.

28:32.784 --> 28:34.116
What did they do to you?

28:34.118 --> 28:35.818
Monet? Did they...?

28:35.820 --> 28:38.087
Yeah, she-she got out,
but who knows how long?

28:38.089 --> 28:41.524
My ring. I want to get my ring.

28:41.526 --> 28:44.093
(panting)

28:44.095 --> 28:45.461
(groaning and coughing)

28:45.463 --> 28:47.997
(panting)
(groaning and coughing)

28:49.267 --> 28:51.667
(yelling)

28:51.669 --> 28:55.271
(groans)
(laughing)

28:55.273 --> 28:57.473
(coughing)
(laughing)

28:57.475 --> 29:01.777
(bleep) you,
you (bleep) butcher!

29:01.779 --> 29:04.547
(groaning)

29:04.549 --> 29:06.215
(yelling)

29:17.028 --> 29:18.895
AUDREY:
There we go. Watch your head.
(Lee whimpers)

29:18.897 --> 29:21.030
Here we go.
Okay. Okay. God.

29:21.032 --> 29:23.833
Oh, my God.
Oh! I should've
grabbed some more oxy

29:23.835 --> 29:26.669
from those goddamn
Polks. (groans)

29:26.671 --> 29:29.138
I have some stuff in
my luggage in my room.

29:29.140 --> 29:32.408
(both panting)

29:32.410 --> 29:34.143
What?
Oh, my God.

29:34.145 --> 29:38.180
Jesus Christ,
who is that?

29:38.182 --> 29:40.483
I don't know.

29:43.588 --> 29:45.354
Oh.

29:45.356 --> 29:48.891
(panting)

29:55.233 --> 29:58.167
Oh, my God!

29:58.169 --> 30:01.103
Matt? Matt?!

30:01.105 --> 30:03.272
(wailing)

30:03.274 --> 30:06.075
(sobbing)
Lee.

30:06.077 --> 30:08.177
Lee, please,

30:08.179 --> 30:11.080
I'm so sorry.

30:11.082 --> 30:15.751
But whoever or whatever did this
is probably still in this house.

30:15.753 --> 30:18.588
We have to keep going.
It like you said--

30:18.590 --> 30:20.723
it's done. Come on.

30:20.725 --> 30:23.125
Come on. Come on.

30:23.127 --> 30:25.294
Lift up, lift up. Come on.

30:25.296 --> 30:28.064
Okay. Lee, please.

30:28.066 --> 30:29.865
I'm so sorry.

30:29.867 --> 30:33.102
(crying)
Come on. Keep going. Come on.

30:33.104 --> 30:35.304
Come on.
(grunts)

30:35.306 --> 30:38.374
Come on.

30:38.376 --> 30:40.276
Come on. All right, wait, wait.

30:40.278 --> 30:42.111
Let me get the door. Hold on.

30:42.113 --> 30:44.213
All right.

30:44.215 --> 30:46.082
Here we go.

30:46.084 --> 30:48.651
(panting)
(groaning)

30:48.653 --> 30:51.420
You can do it. Almost.

30:51.422 --> 30:53.255
LEE:
What happened here?

30:53.257 --> 30:55.358
Where is everyone?
(panting)

30:56.995 --> 31:00.262
AUDREY:
Oh, my God.

31:00.264 --> 31:02.331
(panting)

31:02.333 --> 31:04.133
Okay.

31:04.135 --> 31:08.070
Okay.
(panting, groaning)

31:08.072 --> 31:11.073
I'm gonna go upstairs
and get the medicine

31:11.075 --> 31:12.408
and you stay here.

31:12.410 --> 31:15.344
You're not gonna leave me
down here by myself.

31:15.346 --> 31:18.347
All right then. Come on.

31:18.349 --> 31:21.350
(panting)
(groaning)

31:21.352 --> 31:23.085
All right.

31:23.087 --> 31:25.821
Lean into me. Come on.

31:25.823 --> 31:28.224
(panting)
(groaning)

31:31.596 --> 31:33.362
Come on, lean on me.
(shouts)

31:33.364 --> 31:36.098
Put your weight on me.
Okay.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.267
Okay. All right.
(groans, panting)

31:38.269 --> 31:40.503
Okay.

31:40.505 --> 31:42.204
Okay.

31:42.206 --> 31:45.107
I know I've got
the stuff in here.

31:45.109 --> 31:47.610
(panting)
Oh, look.

31:47.612 --> 31:50.613
A little Burberry for under
your head. Lift up, lift up.

31:50.615 --> 31:51.947
There we go.

31:51.949 --> 31:54.517
I'm sorry. Okay.

31:54.519 --> 31:56.952
Okay.

31:56.954 --> 32:00.089
Aha.
(panting)

32:01.025 --> 32:03.192
The good stuff.

32:03.194 --> 32:05.594
Do you want a joint?

32:08.066 --> 32:10.533
(crying)
Oh, Lee.

32:12.036 --> 32:15.137
Lee, I'm so sorry.

32:15.139 --> 32:17.073
I'm so sorry.

32:17.075 --> 32:19.809
(sniffling)

32:19.811 --> 32:21.143
Oh, God.

32:21.145 --> 32:24.180
Um... okay.

32:24.182 --> 32:25.981
Look at me.

32:25.983 --> 32:28.751
We're gonna be all right, okay?

32:28.753 --> 32:31.654
We're gonna be all right.
Careful now. Careful.

32:32.590 --> 32:35.024
You're a mess.

32:35.026 --> 32:36.058
(chuckles)

32:36.060 --> 32:38.227
You're a mess.

32:38.229 --> 32:41.063
(crying)

32:41.065 --> 32:43.899
(bleep) bitch took
my goddamned tooth.

32:43.901 --> 32:45.267
(sniffles)

32:45.269 --> 32:47.203
Here.

32:47.205 --> 32:49.772
How 'bout one
of these, yes?

32:49.774 --> 32:51.774
How 'bout two?
Yeah.

32:51.776 --> 32:53.242
I'm gonna get us
some water.

32:53.244 --> 32:55.878
(sniffles, grunts)

32:55.880 --> 32:57.947
I'll be right back.

32:57.949 --> 33:00.182
(screaming)

33:00.184 --> 33:02.952
Oh, my God!

33:02.954 --> 33:06.122
Oh, my God! Oh,
my God! Poor Shelby!

33:06.124 --> 33:09.191
I feel like part of me
has died with her!

33:09.193 --> 33:11.694
Oh, my God!
DOMINIC:
She killed herself.

33:11.696 --> 33:13.195
(gasping)

33:13.197 --> 33:15.865
Did you find Sidney?

33:15.867 --> 33:17.366
We got to get the hell out
of here, man.

33:17.368 --> 33:19.769
Sidney is dead!

33:19.771 --> 33:22.304
There is no help!
(sighs)

33:22.306 --> 33:24.039
We can't go outside
and we can't stay here.

33:24.041 --> 33:25.875
They're freaking
everywhere, man.

33:25.877 --> 33:27.309
What happened
in the basement?

33:27.311 --> 33:29.111
Who killed my brother?

33:29.113 --> 33:31.781
Shelby.
Oh, give me a break!

33:31.783 --> 33:34.283
Then she came
up here and...

33:34.285 --> 33:35.985
she killed herself.

33:35.987 --> 33:40.222
She flipped out when she saw
Matt having sex with that thing.

33:40.224 --> 33:42.224
(sighs heavily)

33:42.226 --> 33:44.059
She just... She went nuts

33:44.061 --> 33:46.262
and busted his head open
with a crowbar.

33:46.264 --> 33:48.798
And she just...
She couldn't live with herself,

33:48.800 --> 33:50.633
so she slit
her own throat.

33:50.635 --> 33:52.101
I was here.
I saw everything.

33:52.103 --> 33:53.769
I tried to stop her,
but I...

33:53.771 --> 33:56.572
I just couldn't.

33:56.574 --> 33:58.474
You expect us
to believe that shit,

33:58.476 --> 34:00.476
when you're the one
holding the knife?

34:00.478 --> 34:02.645
Oh, (bleep) off.
It's on the cameras.

34:02.647 --> 34:06.248
Oh, conveniently for you,
we can't play it back.

34:06.250 --> 34:07.650
You (bleep) liar.

34:07.652 --> 34:10.152
Shelby would never kill Matt.
She loved him.

34:10.154 --> 34:11.987
She came here to
get back with him!

34:11.989 --> 34:13.856
What are you talking about?
You're the one that hated her.

34:13.858 --> 34:15.424
Get out of my sight!
Said she
was destroying Matt.

34:15.426 --> 34:17.927
Get out of here!
Come on.

34:17.929 --> 34:20.329
AUDREY:
You did something, you snake.
I know you did.

34:20.331 --> 34:22.331
Shelby would never kill herself!

34:22.333 --> 34:24.033
She's way too self-centered

34:24.035 --> 34:26.035
to commit suicide!
I played her for six months!

34:26.037 --> 34:28.604
I know her better
than I know myself!
DOMINIC: Listen to me,

34:28.606 --> 34:30.272
everybody's messed up.

34:30.274 --> 34:32.775
We've all been through
a ton of shit.

34:32.777 --> 34:34.276
But this place
is (bleep) dangerous.

34:34.278 --> 34:35.978
Now, if you want to live,
we have to stick together.

34:35.980 --> 34:38.714
(bleep) you.

34:38.716 --> 34:39.982
(slammed door echoes)

34:39.984 --> 34:41.550
Come on,
don't shut me out.

34:41.552 --> 34:43.552
(squealing)
DOMINIC: Let me in! Let me in!

34:43.554 --> 34:45.187
(knocking)
Let me in!

34:45.189 --> 34:47.156
You have to open the door.
You have to open the door.

34:47.158 --> 34:49.158
There was something
out there! I saw it!

34:49.160 --> 34:51.360
It's his fault they're all dead.

34:51.362 --> 34:52.228
(Dominic grunts)

34:52.230 --> 34:55.030
(Dominic's muffled shouts)

34:55.032 --> 34:57.233
(crying):
Oh, my God...

34:57.235 --> 34:59.301
(snorting)
(yelling)

34:59.303 --> 35:00.736
(cleaver strikes)

35:00.738 --> 35:03.038
(whispering):
If I die...

35:03.040 --> 35:04.840
I just want you all to know

35:04.842 --> 35:08.010
I had so many wonderful
performances waiting for you.

35:08.012 --> 35:10.346
There were so many things
I was gonna give to you

35:10.348 --> 35:11.914
as my fans.

35:11.916 --> 35:14.416
(sniffles) And I promise you,
I promise you...

35:14.418 --> 35:16.218
I will love you always.

35:16.220 --> 35:19.221
(Piggy Man screeches outside)
I had so much more to give.

35:19.223 --> 35:20.489
I love you.

35:20.491 --> 35:23.225
(snorting)

35:29.333 --> 35:32.167
¶ ¶

35:32.169 --> 35:34.904
(house creaking)

35:51.422 --> 35:53.289
Oh, thank God.

35:55.192 --> 35:58.360
I didn't think we were gonna
make it through the night.

35:58.362 --> 36:00.596
(panting softly)

36:04.135 --> 36:05.868
What time is it?

36:05.870 --> 36:08.437
I can't believe
this phone is still working.

36:08.439 --> 36:10.105
We have to go back.

36:10.107 --> 36:12.207
Go back?

36:12.209 --> 36:14.043
Go back where?

36:14.045 --> 36:16.478
To the Polk farm.

36:16.480 --> 36:19.882
I'm s...
Have you gone mad?

36:19.884 --> 36:21.617
I'm not going back out
into those woods.

36:21.619 --> 36:23.485
Those two savages
are still out there.

36:23.487 --> 36:26.221
We killed people
last night, Audrey.

36:26.223 --> 36:28.223
The both of us.

36:28.225 --> 36:30.626
There's a video of
it on that farm.

36:30.628 --> 36:32.728
I want that tape
before someone else

36:32.730 --> 36:34.330
finds it.
That video

36:34.332 --> 36:36.799
also shows me and Monet
being force-fed

36:36.801 --> 36:38.467
your goddamn leg, Lee.

36:38.469 --> 36:40.235
They were torturing us!

36:40.237 --> 36:42.237
I want people to see it!
There isn't a jury

36:42.239 --> 36:43.739
in the world
that would convict us.

36:43.741 --> 36:46.775
The wrong people get their
hands on that footage,

36:46.777 --> 36:49.278
the only thing
the world will see

36:49.280 --> 36:52.114
is the image of you caving in
an old woman's head

36:52.116 --> 36:53.682
with a hammer.

36:53.684 --> 36:58.253
That is what people will
remember, I promise you.

36:58.255 --> 36:59.154
(sighs)

36:59.156 --> 37:00.589
I'm getting
that tape,

37:00.591 --> 37:01.991
then I'm gonna
hot-wire their truck

37:01.993 --> 37:03.325
and get the hell
out of here.

37:03.327 --> 37:04.793
You're welcome
to come with.

37:04.795 --> 37:07.029
(Lee grunting in pain)

37:07.031 --> 37:09.832
(shuddering breaths)

37:09.834 --> 37:11.600
Oh, bloody hell.

37:17.108 --> 37:19.875
Take these pills, okay?

37:19.877 --> 37:22.411
All right, let's go.

37:24.015 --> 37:25.647
(labored breathing)

37:25.649 --> 37:28.217
(door opens)

37:28.219 --> 37:30.853
(panting)

37:30.855 --> 37:33.789
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

37:33.791 --> 37:36.225
Oh, God,
oh, no, no, no, no, no.

37:36.227 --> 37:38.160
(panting):
I don't want to go.

37:38.162 --> 37:41.563
Oh, God. Oh, God.

37:41.565 --> 37:44.166
He really was such
a wonderful scene partner.

37:44.168 --> 37:47.036
He gave me so much to play with.
Some of my best moments were...

37:47.038 --> 37:48.370
Yeah, hold on there.

37:48.372 --> 37:50.973
(quietly):
Okay. Okay.

37:54.678 --> 37:57.246
Okay, here we go.

37:57.248 --> 38:00.082
I can't look at him again.

38:00.084 --> 38:01.917
(panting softly)

38:01.919 --> 38:03.419
Right.

38:03.421 --> 38:05.020
Okay.

38:05.022 --> 38:07.089
I think we can go
out the front door.

38:07.091 --> 38:09.391
It should be safe;
it's daylight.

38:11.195 --> 38:13.095
Oh, God.

38:13.097 --> 38:14.396
Careful.

38:14.398 --> 38:16.331
Okay.

38:17.268 --> 38:19.268
Almost there.

38:19.270 --> 38:21.403
AUDREY: Lean on me more.
It's all right.

38:21.405 --> 38:23.372
Okay.

38:23.374 --> 38:25.607
(panting):
Okay.

38:29.113 --> 38:30.879
(Audrey and Lee scream)

38:30.881 --> 38:32.681
Stop, goddamn it! Stop!
It's me.

38:32.683 --> 38:35.050
It's me.

38:35.052 --> 38:37.186
Dylan?
