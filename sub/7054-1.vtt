00:00.889 --> 00:01.889
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:01.890 --> 00:03.257
you are looking
through a window

00:03.325 --> 00:04.659
into another world.

00:04.727 --> 00:06.928
An alternate universe
just like ours.

00:06.996 --> 00:09.931
And in each of them,
there is a version of us.

00:09.999 --> 00:12.233
I can't let Peter die again.

00:12.301 --> 00:13.568
I can save him.

00:13.636 --> 00:14.802
Walter, Peter is dead.

00:14.870 --> 00:16.404
You're talking about
the other Peter.

00:16.472 --> 00:18.339
The one on the other side.

00:18.407 --> 00:20.575
I crossed into another universe

00:20.643 --> 00:22.910
and took a son
that wasn't mine.

00:22.978 --> 00:24.278
God help me.

00:24.279 --> 00:25.279
23 YEARS LATER

00:25.614 --> 00:26.981
<i>Peter bishop?
Olivia Dunham.</i>

00:27.049 --> 00:27.982
I'm with the F.B.I.

00:28.050 --> 00:29.584
Your father is Walter bishop.

00:29.652 --> 00:31.819
He worked out of Harvard
in an area called

00:31.887 --> 00:33.221
fringe science.

00:33.288 --> 00:36.024
You're telling me my father
was Dr. Frankenstein.

00:36.091 --> 00:38.493
Ask yourself
why they picked you.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.195
We gave you the ability
to identify things

00:41.263 --> 00:42.664
from the other universe.

00:42.731 --> 00:45.066
Was it me who described it
as a glimmer?

00:45.134 --> 00:46.467
I'm not from here, am I?

00:46.535 --> 00:49.003
<i>Son...
I am not your son.</i>

00:49.071 --> 00:50.938
I can take you back
where you belong.

00:51.006 --> 00:52.006
<i>Peter is in danger.</i>

00:52.074 --> 00:54.042
Help us cross over.

00:54.109 --> 00:56.611
Walter over here
is the secretary of defense.

00:56.679 --> 00:57.945
The fringe team answers to him.

00:58.013 --> 01:00.214
<i>This is your team?
Agents Francis and Dunham.</i>

01:00.282 --> 01:02.050
These invaders from
another universe

01:02.117 --> 01:03.051
can't be trusted.

01:03.118 --> 01:04.718
You gotta trust me.
I'm you.

01:10.192 --> 01:11.459
You have to come back.

01:11.527 --> 01:12.794
Because you belong with me.

01:12.861 --> 01:14.796
We're heading
back to the opera house.

01:14.863 --> 01:16.831
<i>Make the switch.</i>

01:16.899 --> 01:18.533
<i>Welcome back.</i>

01:26.108 --> 01:27.975
Please let me out of here.

01:28.043 --> 01:29.677
Please let me out of here!

01:36.618 --> 01:38.653
<i>Agent Dunham,</i>

01:38.721 --> 01:41.723
<i>I'm trying to help you
get your life back</i>

01:41.790 --> 01:45.593
<i>so that you can go home,
back to your life,</i>

01:45.661 --> 01:49.297
<i>your job, your family.</i>

01:50.766 --> 01:53.901
This is not my home.

01:53.969 --> 01:57.138
<i>Because you come
from another universe?</i>

01:57.206 --> 01:59.574
Yes.

01:59.641 --> 02:03.010
Olivia...

02:03.078 --> 02:05.012
what is happening to you,

02:05.080 --> 02:06.647
given the nature of your job,

02:06.715 --> 02:08.850
the upsetting events
you come in contact with

02:08.917 --> 02:10.383
on a regular basis,

02:10.452 --> 02:13.354
<i>coupled with the injury
to your head,</i>

02:13.422 --> 02:15.356
<i>it's not surprising</i>

02:15.424 --> 02:19.327
<i>your mind
has created this fantasy...</i>

02:19.394 --> 02:22.497
<i>a means of processing
the trauma.</i>

02:22.564 --> 02:24.932
This is not a fantasy.

02:28.270 --> 02:30.037
You agree

02:30.105 --> 02:32.874
you are an Agent
with fringe division.

02:32.941 --> 02:37.445
I work for the FBI
in fringe division...

02:39.114 --> 02:42.550
dealing with weird
and mysterious events

02:42.618 --> 02:44.752
that threaten the safety
of the United States

02:44.820 --> 02:47.088
and its residents.

02:47.156 --> 02:48.523
<i>Good.</i>

Advertise your product or brand here

02:57.466 --> 02:59.400
Is this your mother?

03:01.069 --> 03:04.172
She looks like her,
but it isn't her.

03:10.846 --> 03:14.482
And these?

03:14.550 --> 03:17.318
Agent Lincoln Lee,
Charlie Francis...

03:17.386 --> 03:20.188
are these your partners?

03:20.255 --> 03:23.057
No.

03:29.932 --> 03:31.966
And who is this?

03:36.772 --> 03:39.106
Another Olivia Dunham...

03:39.174 --> 03:42.777
the Olivia Dunham
from over here.

03:44.947 --> 03:47.682
And how does that sound
to you, Olivia...

03:47.749 --> 03:49.350
what you're saying?

03:49.418 --> 03:51.986
That there's a world
beyond this world

03:52.054 --> 03:55.756
populated with people who look
exactly like the people here?

03:55.824 --> 04:00.061
It sounds preposterous...

04:00.128 --> 04:03.231
which is what I thought
when I first learned about it,

04:03.298 --> 04:05.933
but as insane as it sounds,
it's the truth.

04:07.903 --> 04:09.770
Who's Peter?

04:13.308 --> 04:17.612
After you were injured
outside the opera house,

04:17.678 --> 04:22.516
when you were under anesthesia,
you mumbled the name "peter."

04:22.584 --> 04:25.253
is he one of your friends?

04:25.320 --> 04:27.822
The ones who came here with you
from the other universe?

04:27.890 --> 04:30.191
Peter is my colleague...

04:30.259 --> 04:32.860
a civilian consultant.

04:32.928 --> 04:35.096
My team and I crossed over here

04:35.163 --> 04:37.698
to find him and bring him home.

04:39.935 --> 04:42.870
And where are they now...

04:42.938 --> 04:44.805
Peter and your friends?

04:44.873 --> 04:47.174
I don't know.

04:47.242 --> 04:50.778
<i>But I assume they had
to go home without me.</i>

04:52.714 --> 04:55.216
Olivia...

04:55.284 --> 04:58.719
I know it's really scary...

04:58.787 --> 05:01.656
not being in control
of one's own mind.

05:01.723 --> 05:03.257
<i>Dr. Anderson...</i>

05:03.325 --> 05:05.826
I am not crazy.

05:05.894 --> 05:07.828
That is not my mother.

05:07.896 --> 05:11.065
My mother died when I was 14.

05:11.133 --> 05:15.202
The Charlie Francis
that I knew was murdered.

05:15.270 --> 05:17.505
I have never won
an Olympic medal

05:17.572 --> 05:20.708
for marksmanship.

05:20.776 --> 05:22.944
None of these are me.

05:23.011 --> 05:25.379
This is not my life.

05:25.447 --> 05:27.548
You think I'm trying
to convince you

05:27.616 --> 05:30.318
you're someone you're not?

05:30.385 --> 05:32.720
Why would I do that?

05:32.788 --> 05:35.356
I don't know.

05:35.424 --> 05:39.260
You wanted to see me, sir?

05:41.196 --> 05:43.197
The treatments are not working.

05:43.265 --> 05:45.967
Well, that's, uh,
not such a surprise.

05:46.034 --> 05:48.369
We always knew that
transferring memories

05:48.437 --> 05:50.371
was a long shot at best.

05:55.410 --> 05:57.979
Let's try again, please.

05:58.046 --> 06:00.881
Sir, if we give her
another dose...

06:00.949 --> 06:02.850
it could kill her.

06:06.588 --> 06:08.990
You and I know something

06:09.057 --> 06:11.826
that many lives
and many more dollars

06:11.893 --> 06:15.096
have been spent to keep secret.

06:15.163 --> 06:19.166
That we are at war...

06:19.234 --> 06:22.069
at war with another universe...

06:22.137 --> 06:24.171
<i>populated by creatures</i>

06:24.239 --> 06:27.641
<i>who have damaged
the very fabric of reality.</i>

06:27.709 --> 06:30.678
<i>All around us,
our world is under attack.</i>

06:30.746 --> 06:35.683
Somehow, this girl came here.

06:35.751 --> 06:40.855
Somehow, she is equipped
to move through universes.

06:40.922 --> 06:45.826
We need her to help us
understand this skill...

06:48.263 --> 06:50.698
because if we can do it,

06:50.766 --> 06:53.267
we can win this war.

06:55.771 --> 06:58.372
And if not...

06:58.440 --> 07:01.442
soon, there'll be nothing
left to protect.

07:06.048 --> 07:08.482
Let's try again.

07:20.962 --> 07:23.197
Is it dinner already?

07:23.265 --> 07:25.166
<i>Afraid not.</i>

07:57.265 --> 07:58.666
<i>Please...</i>

07:58.733 --> 08:01.735
please don't do this again.

08:36.071 --> 08:40.006
I don't feel so good.

08:40.075 --> 08:41.575
I can't...

08:41.643 --> 08:43.043
<i>can't breathe.
Unstrap her.</i>

08:43.111 --> 08:44.745
<i>Sit her up.</i>

09:09.171 --> 09:11.639
<i>Code blue. code blue.</i>

09:23.084 --> 09:24.018
Freeze!

09:24.085 --> 09:25.085
Come on! come on!

09:25.153 --> 09:26.086
Hold it right there!

09:48.109 --> 09:49.343
<i>Hold it right there!</i>

09:53.548 --> 09:55.149

Henry.

10:58.312 --> 11:00.079
<i>Okay, listen, Henry.</i>

11:00.147 --> 11:04.350
What I need you to do right now

11:06.820 --> 11:08.287
Okay.

11:23.003 --> 11:24.804
No, sir.
Not yet.

11:24.871 --> 11:27.306
Shore patrol says there's no way

I think from what I know of
Olivia Dunham

11:33.847 --> 11:36.082
she's the one person I would bet
on who could survive.

11:36.149 --> 11:39.618
Then find her.

11:46.493 --> 11:48.260
Why are you wearing
a hospital gown?

11:48.328 --> 11:51.030
Are you sick?

11:58.305 --> 12:00.673
I've been held against my will,

12:00.741 --> 12:03.075
and I'm being pursued
by a division of the government.

12:03.143 --> 12:06.012
<i>They've done experiments

12:14.821 --> 12:17.023
<i>Is that your family?</i>

Look, I'm just getting

12:23.830 --> 12:25.598
I don't know what you're doing,
but the last thing

12:25.665 --> 12:27.900
I need now
is any kind of trouble.

12:27.968 --> 12:30.936
You're not

12:31.004 --> 12:33.339
as long as you do exactly

12:37.411 --> 12:39.178
Okay, I want you to slow down

13:05.005 --> 13:07.139

<i>Knock, knock.</i>

14:01.828 --> 14:03.729
Uh, no one,

14:03.797 --> 14:05.564
'cause you're so ugly,

14:05.632 --> 14:07.466
no one would come to your door.

14:07.534 --> 14:10.035
<i>Ha ha.</i>

14:10.103 --> 14:12.138
Hey, Melissa, you know how
Agent Francis can tell

14:12.205 --> 14:14.440
which end the worms living
inside his body are which?

14:14.508 --> 14:17.877
Tickles them in the middle
and sees which end farts.

14:19.012 --> 14:20.713
Boom.

14:20.780 --> 14:24.583
I'll get you some water,
Lincoln.

14:24.651 --> 14:26.752
So...

14:26.820 --> 14:30.890
what have you heard?

14:30.957 --> 14:33.292
How much longer
are they gonna keep her there?

14:33.360 --> 14:35.261
You know Olivia.

14:35.328 --> 14:37.930
She's strong.

14:37.998 --> 14:40.933
Physically,
she's doing a lot better.

14:41.001 --> 14:45.604
But they're saying she had
a complete psychotic break.

14:45.672 --> 14:49.208
I've heard of people losing
time, you know?

14:49.276 --> 14:50.676
Not being able
to remember the day

14:50.744 --> 14:53.379
leading up
to a bad car accident.

14:53.446 --> 14:55.114
But this is crazy.

14:57.684 --> 14:59.251
And the other Olivia?

14:59.319 --> 15:01.020
She escaped to the other side,

15:01.087 --> 15:05.958
along with the secretary's son
and the other Walter bishop.

15:06.026 --> 15:08.260
You know, three days ago,
I was eating a bowl

15:08.328 --> 15:10.029
of chocolate ice cream.

15:10.096 --> 15:13.432
I was watching Tom cruise
kick some ass on TV.

15:13.500 --> 15:15.868
I thought,
"life's pretty good."

15:15.936 --> 15:17.703
now all of this.

15:17.771 --> 15:19.438
<i>I'm afraid
it's just gotten worse.</i>

15:19.506 --> 15:21.507
<i>Sir.</i>

15:21.575 --> 15:23.409
How you coming along?

15:23.476 --> 15:26.445
I'm doing okay.

15:26.513 --> 15:29.181
What is it?

15:31.851 --> 15:34.186
Last night Agent Dunham escaped
from the facility

15:34.254 --> 15:36.188
on liberty island.

15:43.063 --> 15:46.031
<i>Nice ink.</i>

15:46.099 --> 15:47.466
What's it mean?

15:47.534 --> 15:50.536
What?

15:50.604 --> 15:52.538
<i>Tattoo on the back
of your neck.</i>

15:52.606 --> 15:56.575
<i>Looks like a sun
of some kind.</i>

15:56.643 --> 15:59.979
They must have done it to me.

16:00.046 --> 16:01.180
She must have one.

16:01.248 --> 16:03.048
The other one
must have a tattoo.

16:03.116 --> 16:04.883
<i>The girl they're trying
to make you believe you are?</i>

16:04.951 --> 16:05.884
Yeah.

16:05.952 --> 16:08.921
Yeah, that sounds right.
I agree.

16:08.989 --> 16:10.623
Hey, don't do that.

16:10.690 --> 16:12.091
Don't placate me
because you think that I'm...

16:12.158 --> 16:13.425
what?
Crazy?

16:13.493 --> 16:14.860
<i>And what would you think
if I jacked your cab</i>

16:14.928 --> 16:15.928
<i>in a hospital gown</i>

16:15.996 --> 16:18.063
with a gun,
screaming a conspiracy,

16:18.131 --> 16:19.698
telling you I'm being chased
by the government

16:19.766 --> 16:21.166
and folks are trying
to make me believe

16:21.234 --> 16:22.668
<i>I'm a tattooed version
of myself.</i>

16:22.736 --> 16:23.936
<i>Look, I know
I sound insane.
a little bit.</i>

16:24.004 --> 16:25.404
Well, I'm not insane.

16:25.472 --> 16:28.040
I'm not who they say I am.

16:37.484 --> 16:39.485
Okay.

16:46.760 --> 16:48.594
So where we going?

16:52.766 --> 16:55.934
You're taking me home.

16:56.002 --> 16:58.270
I don't have to tell you a
delusional fringe division Agent

16:58.338 --> 17:00.039
with sensitive,
classified information

17:00.106 --> 17:02.107
is of great concern.

17:05.545 --> 17:07.112
Do you have any idea
where she's gone?

17:07.180 --> 17:08.946
Not yet.

17:09.015 --> 17:12.151
<i>Considering her mental state,
she could be anywhere.</i>

17:13.987 --> 17:15.820
Where you going?

17:15.888 --> 17:18.589
To get my clothes.
Not you.

17:18.657 --> 17:20.626
If Olivia's in trouble,
I'm not sitting here.

17:20.694 --> 17:22.661
I thought you had to go back
to the hyperbaric chamber.

17:22.729 --> 17:25.396
I can be out for eight hours
at a time.

17:25.464 --> 17:26.865
I got six hours left today.

17:30.904 --> 17:33.272
Melissa.

17:35.108 --> 17:36.742
Get my nanite wraps.

17:56.162 --> 17:59.365
If I'm not back in 15 minutes,
you can leave.

17:59.432 --> 18:02.534
The opera house...
that's where your home is?

18:02.602 --> 18:04.370
No, but that's how I got here,

18:04.437 --> 18:06.638
and that's how I'm gonna
get back there.

18:06.706 --> 18:09.608
What's to stop me
from leaving now?

18:14.614 --> 18:15.981
Henry Arliss Higgins...

18:16.049 --> 18:19.118
3248 hastings Avenue,
apartment 3.

18:19.185 --> 18:23.956
I.d. number
10-02-25-056768.

18:24.023 --> 18:25.824
Blood type, "b" negative.

18:25.892 --> 18:27.126
Your inoculations
are up to date

18:27.193 --> 18:30.229
except for your typhus,
which is 17 days overdue.

18:30.296 --> 18:33.832
You might want to get that
taken care of.

18:50.517 --> 18:51.483
<i>Hey!</i>

18:51.551 --> 18:53.619
Hey!

18:53.686 --> 18:55.387
Agent Dunham,

18:55.455 --> 18:56.688
I'm sorry,
I didn't recognize you.

18:56.756 --> 18:57.890
I wasn't aware

18:57.957 --> 18:59.558
that the fringe division
was overseeing this.

18:59.626 --> 19:01.994
Oh, uh, it's okay.
I should have I.d.'d myself.

19:02.061 --> 19:05.697
So is it, uh, true what they say
about this place?

19:05.765 --> 19:10.002
People have disappeared
into thin air inside?

19:10.069 --> 19:12.271
I know, I know.
"classified."

19:12.338 --> 19:14.006
things keep getting weirder
and weirder all the time.

19:14.073 --> 19:15.274
If you'll excuse me,
I'm just gonna...

19:15.341 --> 19:16.708
yeah, you know,
we should... we should step back.

19:16.776 --> 19:18.177
I-I-I'll only be
a minute.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.578
No, no.
There's no time for that.

19:19.646 --> 19:21.346
The protocol's already
in effect.

19:21.414 --> 19:23.982
Yeah, I understand...
Agent, Agent, you can't.

19:37.664 --> 19:39.898
No.

19:55.826 --> 19:57.960
Anything yet?

19:58.028 --> 20:00.296
Agent Farnsworth
is running scenarios.

20:05.636 --> 20:07.803
There's a 6% chance
that Agent Dunham will return

20:07.871 --> 20:09.071
to headquarters to surrender,

20:09.139 --> 20:11.140
an 11% chance that
she will return to attack,

20:11.208 --> 20:13.276
a 21% chance that she
will attempt to contact

20:13.343 --> 20:14.610
someone that she knows,

20:14.678 --> 20:16.746
a 29% chance that she
will return to the theater

20:16.813 --> 20:18.114
where her trauma occurred,

20:18.182 --> 20:20.883
and a 33% chance that she will
attempt to leave the country.

20:20.951 --> 20:22.585
Someone contact the borders?

20:22.653 --> 20:24.654
Yep.
she's good
at disguises.

20:24.721 --> 20:27.390
I've told them that too.

20:27.457 --> 20:28.991
Agent Dunham just left
the Orpheum theater quarantine

20:29.059 --> 20:30.293
in a city taxi.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.828
Get a line on the tracker
in that cab and find it.

20:32.896 --> 20:34.497
Yes, sir.

20:40.370 --> 20:41.370
So...

20:41.438 --> 20:43.172
what now?

20:45.275 --> 20:49.111
I don't know yet.
Can you just keep driving?

20:50.881 --> 20:53.749
It's my wife.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.284
Okay.

20:55.352 --> 20:58.120
Don't do
anything foolish, Henry.

21:01.191 --> 21:04.227
Hey.

21:04.294 --> 21:05.761
Yeah, yeah.
I know.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.230
<i>I never put it in there.</i>

21:07.297 --> 21:09.532
<i>It was in Laura's old room.</i>

21:09.600 --> 21:11.834
<i>Laura's... yeah.</i>

21:11.902 --> 21:13.636
Nothing.
I-I got a fare.

21:13.704 --> 21:16.172
<i>Okay.</i>

21:16.240 --> 21:19.008
<i>Around 7:00?</i>

21:21.011 --> 21:24.080
I love you, hon.

21:24.147 --> 21:27.116
For sure.

21:29.353 --> 21:32.421
What's her name?

21:34.658 --> 21:36.158
Jasmine.

21:36.226 --> 21:38.894
<i>Unless I'm in the doghouse...
then she's "honey."</i>

21:38.962 --> 21:41.163
so most of the time,
it's "honey."

21:43.533 --> 21:45.167
what about you?
You got someone?

21:45.235 --> 21:48.904
Sort of.

21:48.972 --> 21:52.041
That's an odd name...
"sort of."

21:52.109 --> 21:55.077
his name is Peter.

21:55.145 --> 21:57.446
He's sort of the reason
I'm here.

22:05.222 --> 22:07.990
Can you take me
to 655 18th street,

22:08.058 --> 22:09.191
<i>just off 10th Avenue?</i>

22:09.259 --> 22:11.093
What's there?

22:11.161 --> 22:13.562
It's a company called
massive dynamic.
never heard of it.

22:13.630 --> 22:15.064
<i>They make technology
that could get me home.</i>

22:15.132 --> 22:17.333
If I'm right,
there's a lady who works there

22:17.401 --> 22:20.503
who may be able to help me.

22:20.570 --> 22:22.238
Well, if we're going down
to Chelsea,

22:22.306 --> 22:25.041
we're gonna need some gas.

22:42.993 --> 22:44.427
Remember.

22:44.494 --> 22:46.395
Yeah, I know.
I know.

22:46.463 --> 22:50.232
You got my number.

22:50.300 --> 22:52.835
Jedi mind trick.

24:10.614 --> 24:13.682
<i>Hey, Liv.</i>

24:13.750 --> 24:16.852
Thank God we found you.

24:25.906 --> 24:29.042
Okay.

24:29.109 --> 24:31.644
I know I'm not quite
my handsome self,

24:31.712 --> 24:33.880
but a hello would be nice.

24:39.053 --> 24:43.523
I know about the shootout
at the Orpheum.

24:43.590 --> 24:47.126
<i>Colonel Broyles
told me all about it.</i>

24:47.194 --> 24:50.063
You know, you took
a blow to your head...

24:50.130 --> 24:51.597
don't you come any closer.

24:51.665 --> 24:55.034
<i>Liv, I'm going
through it myself.</i>

24:55.102 --> 24:57.470
Believe me, I know
that the treatment

24:57.538 --> 25:00.073
can feel worse
than the disease...

25:00.140 --> 25:02.308
but they're just trying
to fix you.

25:02.376 --> 25:04.744
<i>We all just want
to help you get bet...</i>

25:07.514 --> 25:08.648
Liv?

25:08.715 --> 25:12.652
Take your gun out
and put it on the ground.

25:12.719 --> 25:15.488
Olivia, come on.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.523
<i>I've been your partner
for two years.</i>

25:17.591 --> 25:21.761
Put your gun on the ground.

25:31.905 --> 25:34.407
This isn't necessary.

25:34.475 --> 25:36.342
Kick it over here.

25:36.410 --> 25:38.311
What do you think I'm gonna do?

25:38.378 --> 25:39.545
<i>I don't know.</i>

25:39.613 --> 25:42.448
I don't know you.

25:42.516 --> 25:46.285
Whatever they told you,
I am not who you think I am.

25:54.828 --> 25:56.762
<i>Liv, think
about what you're doing.</i>

25:59.166 --> 26:01.434
You can't just keep running.

26:22.856 --> 26:24.590
Get in the car.

26:31.865 --> 26:35.067
Get in the car!

26:35.135 --> 26:36.469
Drive.

26:36.537 --> 26:38.137
What are you doing?
Just drive!

26:38.205 --> 26:39.438
Liv!

26:39.506 --> 26:41.807
Go, go, go, go.

26:44.178 --> 26:45.845
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:45.913 --> 26:46.913
Hey!

27:01.628 --> 27:05.031
You're a hell of a shot.

27:05.098 --> 27:06.866
No, actually, I'm not.

27:06.934 --> 27:09.936
Well, you could have fooled me.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.850
Hey, what are you doing?

27:28.155 --> 27:31.424
They won't be able
to find us now.

27:31.491 --> 27:34.860
Thank you.

27:34.928 --> 27:37.163
Yeah.

27:46.073 --> 27:49.141
She must have removed
the cab's tracker.

27:49.209 --> 27:50.810
We've tapped
into the surveillance cams,

27:50.877 --> 27:52.745
but we haven't picked
anything up yet.

27:54.881 --> 27:56.549
Did you see
the incident footage?

27:56.617 --> 27:58.618
Yes, sir.

27:58.685 --> 28:00.553
<i>Hey!</i>

28:03.223 --> 28:04.790
You know what I'm thinking?

28:04.858 --> 28:08.160
That there's only one person
at fringe division

28:08.228 --> 28:10.496
who could make a shot
like that.

28:10.564 --> 28:13.065
It's working.

28:35.638 --> 28:36.738
Why'd you pull over?

28:36.805 --> 28:38.473
This is it.

28:38.541 --> 28:40.708
18th street, 10th Avenue...
that's where you said.

28:43.012 --> 28:45.580
Oh, no.
What?

28:45.648 --> 28:47.181
It's not here.

28:47.249 --> 28:49.417
<i>They must never
have built it.</i>

28:49.485 --> 28:51.653
Okay, maybe you got
the cross streets wrong.

28:51.720 --> 28:54.455
Let me look it up.

29:28.257 --> 29:30.758
I'm stuck here.

29:45.674 --> 29:47.675
Are you okay?

29:50.045 --> 29:52.614
Shadowgrove circle...

29:52.681 --> 29:55.617
302 shadowgrove circle.

29:55.684 --> 29:57.251
It's in Tarrytown.

29:57.319 --> 29:59.621
I-it's a...
it's a safe house.

29:59.688 --> 30:00.989
Walter must have told me
about it.

30:01.056 --> 30:02.757
I don't know why I forgot.

30:02.825 --> 30:04.659
Tarrytown's about
40 minutes from here.

30:04.727 --> 30:07.495
Okay, we better get going.

30:16.138 --> 30:18.473
Hey, Frank.

30:18.540 --> 30:19.874
Charlie, what's up?

30:19.942 --> 30:21.843
<i>Do you have news
about Olivia?</i>

30:21.910 --> 30:23.311
You mind if I come in?

30:23.379 --> 30:25.380
Come in.

30:32.421 --> 30:35.256
He obviously means
a lot to you.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.860
Excuse me?

30:38.927 --> 30:42.196
The guy you mentioned,
why you say you came here.

30:44.133 --> 30:45.700
Frank?
Yeah.

30:45.768 --> 30:48.236
I thought you said his name
was Peter.

30:50.272 --> 30:53.241
Yeah.

30:53.308 --> 30:55.009
Peter.

30:55.077 --> 30:57.945
Right.

31:00.816 --> 31:03.151
You don't look so good.

31:06.055 --> 31:07.855
How long till we get there?

31:09.792 --> 31:12.126
Not long.

31:17.032 --> 31:19.333
I haven't slept since
this whole thing happened.

31:19.401 --> 31:21.269
I don't even know
what's wrong with her.

31:21.336 --> 31:25.173
Nobody will even give me
a straight answer.

31:28.077 --> 31:30.845
We're gonna get her better.

31:30.913 --> 31:32.146
I promise you.

31:32.214 --> 31:35.316
We just... we just got
to find her.

31:38.053 --> 31:40.988
Can you think
of something that, uh,

31:41.056 --> 31:43.024
we might have missed...

31:43.092 --> 31:47.095
you know, um, someone else
she could have gone to for help,

31:47.162 --> 31:48.830
someplace she
could be hiding out,

31:48.897 --> 31:51.099
a friend, anything?

31:53.302 --> 31:55.002
Marilyn is back in town.

31:55.070 --> 31:56.804
I thought she was in France.

31:56.872 --> 31:58.873
She came home when she heard
what happened.

32:13.455 --> 32:16.324
You know, the last time
I ran a fare out this far,

32:16.391 --> 32:20.027
the meter read about 300 bucks.

32:20.095 --> 32:22.029
Guess I'll just
put it on your tab.

32:27.903 --> 32:30.171
I can wait for you if you like.

32:30.239 --> 32:32.507
No, you go home to your family.

32:32.574 --> 32:35.777
You gonna be okay?

32:35.844 --> 32:38.813
I'm not crazy, you know.

32:41.450 --> 32:43.651
But to prove that to you
I'd have to tell you

32:43.719 --> 32:46.621
some things
that were even crazier.

32:46.688 --> 32:49.857
You know, a few years ago,
I was in a bad way.

32:49.925 --> 32:52.393
Couldn't pull myself out.

32:52.461 --> 32:56.697
Inside, I knew
I was somebody else.

32:56.765 --> 33:01.135
There's only one person
who believed that...

33:01.203 --> 33:02.470
Jasmine.

33:05.073 --> 33:08.142
She saw the man I knew I was.

33:08.210 --> 33:10.778
But she was the only one.

33:13.115 --> 33:15.216
I mean, sometimes
you just got to believe

33:15.284 --> 33:17.285
what you can't see.

33:22.524 --> 33:25.426
Thank you.

35:34.890 --> 35:36.257
<i>Olive?</i>

35:43.398 --> 35:46.400
Mom.

35:58.502 --> 36:01.671
Sweetheart.

36:06.076 --> 36:07.076
I know what happened.

36:07.144 --> 36:08.644
They told me
about your breakdown.

36:08.712 --> 36:10.380
I came home as soon as I heard.

36:10.447 --> 36:13.149
I tried to see you,
but they wouldn't let me.

36:13.217 --> 36:15.752
Sweetheart,
I've been so scared.

36:21.625 --> 36:25.628
I'm not your daughter.

36:25.696 --> 36:28.364
My mother died
when I was 14 years old.

36:28.432 --> 36:30.366
This is all wrong.

36:30.434 --> 36:31.734
<i>You're not supposed
to be here.
sweetheart!</i>

36:31.802 --> 36:33.669
Don't you call me that.
I am not your daughter.

36:33.737 --> 36:34.771
Yes, you are.
You're just confused.

36:34.838 --> 36:36.239
This was going
to be my way home.

36:36.306 --> 36:37.373
This is your home.

36:37.441 --> 36:39.108
No, my home
is in Jacksonville, Florida.

36:39.176 --> 36:41.411
I was... I was brought up
on an army base.

36:41.478 --> 36:42.945
I've never been here before!

36:43.013 --> 36:45.915
If you've never been here,
how did you know to come here?

37:04.735 --> 37:07.203
I helped you paint, didn't I?

37:07.271 --> 37:10.740
Yes.

37:10.808 --> 37:12.275
You picked the colors.

37:12.342 --> 37:13.476
I wanted blue,

37:13.544 --> 37:15.311
<i>but you convinced me
to use...</i>

37:15.379 --> 37:18.681
yellow, because
it was more cheerful.

37:22.186 --> 37:23.519
Sweetheart...

37:23.587 --> 37:25.988
<i>this is your home.</i>

37:26.056 --> 37:29.559
This is your safe house.

37:51.315 --> 37:53.249
Sorry to bother you,
Mrs. Dunham.

37:53.317 --> 37:55.985
Just, um, wondering
if you heard from Olivia.

37:56.053 --> 37:57.086
She's here.

37:57.154 --> 37:59.122
She is?

37:59.189 --> 38:00.756
Come on in.

38:15.105 --> 38:17.273
Hey.

38:20.110 --> 38:22.078
<i>Olivia Dunham
has been recovered.</i>

38:22.146 --> 38:23.779
It appears that your treatments

38:23.847 --> 38:25.982
have taken effect after all.

38:26.049 --> 38:28.784
<i>Your plan was sound.</i>

38:28.852 --> 38:32.455
They just needed a bit more time
than you assumed.

38:32.523 --> 38:34.157
<i>No, it wasn't time.</i>

38:34.224 --> 38:37.360
It was the adrenaline

38:37.427 --> 38:40.163
<i>from her escape.</i>

38:40.230 --> 38:41.731
The adrenaline triggered

38:41.798 --> 38:44.066
our Olivia's
memory "b" lymphocytes.

38:44.134 --> 38:47.136
It carried them
across the blood-brain barrier

38:47.204 --> 38:49.672
and successfully transferred
the memories,

38:49.740 --> 38:53.142
which means for all intents
and purposes...

38:53.210 --> 38:55.244
she is our Olivia now.

39:26.677 --> 39:28.211
Thanks, Charlie.

39:28.278 --> 39:30.613
For what?

39:30.681 --> 39:33.115
For being my friend.

39:33.183 --> 39:34.483
Hey, Liv?

39:34.551 --> 39:36.686
<i>Yeah?</i>

39:36.753 --> 39:38.988
Thank you for not shooting me.

39:44.561 --> 39:46.662
<i>Give her the weekend.</i>

39:46.730 --> 39:49.365
After that, she should be fine
to go to work.

39:49.433 --> 39:51.734
<i>Then I assume this is
the time to ask you, "why?"</i>

39:51.802 --> 39:54.170
why convince her
she's our Olivia Dunham?

39:54.238 --> 39:56.239
Why is it necessary?

39:56.306 --> 40:00.977
You don't need to worry
about that just yet.

40:01.044 --> 40:02.645
You'll know soon enough.

40:02.713 --> 40:04.513
<i>Due respect, Mr. secretary,</i>

40:04.581 --> 40:07.183
you're embedding
one of them on my team,

40:07.251 --> 40:09.885
<i>and you've embedded
my Agent with them.</i>

40:09.953 --> 40:11.887
I need to know now.

40:11.955 --> 40:14.624
Good work today, Phillip.

40:39.149 --> 40:40.683
<i>And that's what
you call him...</i>

40:40.751 --> 40:42.952
"Walternate"...
your real father?

40:43.020 --> 40:45.621
Yeah.

40:45.689 --> 40:48.691
Okay, go on.

40:48.759 --> 40:50.559
Well, Walternate
took me over there

40:50.627 --> 40:53.629
because he said
he needed me to help him

40:53.697 --> 40:55.298
fix the damage
on the other side.

40:55.365 --> 40:58.267
But you believed
he was lying to you.

40:58.335 --> 41:00.636
Yeah, he... he never had
any intention

41:00.704 --> 41:03.105
to... to fix the other side.

41:03.173 --> 41:05.741
He wanted me
to help him destroy ours.

41:08.945 --> 41:11.113
"Hmm," what?

41:11.181 --> 41:13.616
Pen's dying.

41:15.319 --> 41:17.219
Here, give it to me.
I know a trick.

41:17.287 --> 41:18.487
A trick...

41:18.555 --> 41:21.057
to save a dying pen?

41:21.124 --> 41:24.126
Do you want me
to fix it or not?

41:24.194 --> 41:27.330
Ah, it's okay.

41:27.397 --> 41:30.800
We're almost finished here.

41:30.867 --> 41:32.601
<i>I just have
one more question.</i>

41:32.669 --> 41:36.472
<i>Um, you said when you learned
Walternate was lying to you,</i>

41:36.540 --> 41:37.773
your first thought was anger,

41:37.841 --> 41:40.810
that you wanted to put
a stop to his agenda.

41:40.877 --> 41:43.446
<i>But you
could have done that</i>

41:43.513 --> 41:46.182
<i>by staying there.</i>

41:46.249 --> 41:49.952
So the one thing
I don't understand is...

41:50.020 --> 41:52.188
why'd you come back?

42:02.532 --> 42:04.834
<i>You know, I haven't seen those
in a while...</i>

42:04.901 --> 42:07.336
your shoes.

42:07.404 --> 42:09.972
Wallabees.

42:10.040 --> 42:12.041
Are you bringing them back?

42:12.109 --> 42:15.044
Where did they go?

42:20.717 --> 42:23.686
Oh, good.

42:23.754 --> 42:25.187
He's done.

42:32.462 --> 42:33.829
How was it?

42:33.897 --> 42:35.464
It was endless,
but it's over now.

42:35.532 --> 42:37.666
We can get on with our lives.

42:37.734 --> 42:38.701
<i>Great.</i>

42:38.769 --> 42:41.170
How about we start with dinner?

42:41.238 --> 42:42.705
I'm starving.

42:47.144 --> 42:48.310
And the whole time
I was in there,

42:48.378 --> 42:49.945
there was only one thing
I could think about.

42:50.013 --> 42:52.615
Yeah?
What?

42:56.253 --> 42:58.754
That.

43:01.825 --> 43:03.092
Let's go.

43:03.160 --> 43:05.428
I'm sure tomorrow will bring
the usual insanity.

43:05.495 --> 43:07.696
May as well enjoy a night off.
