15:41.608 --> 15:45.078
WHAT SAY YOU AND I GO UPSTAIRS
AND FOOL AROUND, HUH?

15:46.479 --> 15:49.616
UH, DON'T YOU REMEMBER?
WE ALREADY DID.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.120
YEAH?

15:53.186 --> 15:54.554
YOU WERE MARVELOUS.

15:54.621 --> 15:59.259
HA, HA, HA.
OFCOURSE. HA, HA.
AT WHAT?

16:16.476 --> 16:19.112
JUDY, RICHIE,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

16:19.179 --> 16:21.281
YOU'RE OLDER,
BUT NOT BIGGER.

16:21.348 --> 16:24.517
WE DIDN'T EAT
OUR VEGETABLES.

16:27.287 --> 16:30.157
AND WE STAYED UP
PAST OUR BEDTIME.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.937
LAURA,
MY PRECIOUS POLIGRIP.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.273
STEVE.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.741
OHH!

16:53.846 --> 16:56.549
[WHEEZING]

17:03.356 --> 17:06.059
OH, I'M GLAD
YOU WEREN'T UPSTAIRS.

17:08.728 --> 17:09.929
STEVE, HOW ARE YOU?

17:09.996 --> 17:12.632
OH, FINE. I'M FINE.

17:12.699 --> 17:13.866
AND YOU?

17:13.933 --> 17:17.204
OH, YOU'RE
AS LOVELY AS EVER.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.773
THOSE EYES,
THAT HAIR,

17:20.840 --> 17:23.376
AND, WHOA, MAMA,
WHAT A HINEY!

17:26.879 --> 17:28.215
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS,

17:28.281 --> 17:30.117
BUT I'M GLAD
TO SEE YOU.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.686
AT MY AGE, I'M GLAD
TO SEE ANYTHING.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.389
WHOA.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.292
COME ON,
LET'S SIT DOWN.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.393
EASIER SAID
THAN DONE,

17:40.460 --> 17:43.330
BUT I'LL GIVE IT
A SHOT.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.637
[BONES CRACKING]

17:50.703 --> 17:51.804
OOH! AAH!

17:51.871 --> 17:54.141
AAH!

17:55.808 --> 17:59.412
AHH!
AHH!

18:01.514 --> 18:05.418
STEVE, I'M SORRY
I KICKED YOU
OUT OF MY LIFE.

18:05.485 --> 18:06.586
REALLY?

18:06.653 --> 18:07.887
YEAH.

18:07.954 --> 18:11.458
MAYBE YOU AND I
COULD...

18:11.524 --> 18:13.660
YES?

18:13.726 --> 18:14.861
GO OUT ON A DATE.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.696
OH! OH!

18:16.763 --> 18:19.232
OW!

18:19.299 --> 18:21.434
PAIN IS SO CRUEL.

18:25.672 --> 18:26.939
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:27.006 --> 18:31.478
75 LONG, ENDLESS,
AGONIZING YEARS

18:31.544 --> 18:34.281
I'VE WAITED
TO HEAR THOSE WORDS,

18:34.347 --> 18:37.184
AND NOW,
AFTER ALL THAT TIME,

18:37.250 --> 18:40.487
JUST YESTERDAY
I MET SOME CHICK
AND GOT MARRIED.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.624
WHAT?

18:44.691 --> 18:46.393
YOO-HOO, LULU!

18:53.366 --> 18:56.336
YES, STEVEN, DARLING?

19:03.410 --> 19:05.412
LAURA, LULU.
LULU, LAURA.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.416
CHARMED I'M SURE.

19:20.092 --> 19:23.830
COME ON, LET'S SING
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO LILLIAN.

19:23.896 --> 19:24.631
LAURA.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.132
RIGHT.

19:26.199 --> 19:30.437
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU *

19:34.407 --> 19:38.778
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU *

19:40.747 --> 19:44.751
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DEAR... *

19:44.817 --> 19:45.318
NO!

19:45.385 --> 19:46.819
* LAURA *

19:46.886 --> 19:48.355
PLEASE, NO!

19:48.421 --> 19:54.227
* HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO YOU *

19:56.729 --> 19:58.064
NO! PLEASE, NO!

19:58.130 --> 19:59.899

20:02.001 --> 20:04.737
LAURA, LAURA,
WAKE UP.

20:04.804 --> 20:05.272
LAURA.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.873
AAH!
AAH!

20:13.179 --> 20:15.348
I'M YOUNG AGAIN!

20:15.415 --> 20:18.285
AND MY BUTT'S BACK!

20:19.286 --> 20:21.788
WHERE WAS IT?

20:23.356 --> 20:25.892
STEVE, I HAD
A TERRIBLE NIGHTMARE.

20:25.958 --> 20:29.061
I WAS WHIMPERING
UNDER YOUR WINDOW,
AND I HEARD,

20:29.128 --> 20:31.364
SO I CLIMBED UP.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.566
ACTUALLY, I'M GLAD.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.001
YOU ARE?

20:35.067 --> 20:37.737
YES.

20:37.804 --> 20:39.339
LOOK, STEVE,

20:39.406 --> 20:41.708
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
KICKED YOU
OUT OF MY LIFE.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.677
AW, LOOK,
YOU HAD A RIGHT
TO BE UPSET.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.447
I DID USE
MY SUPERIOR INTELLECT

20:47.514 --> 20:51.418
TO SCARE AWAY
DANIEL WALLACE.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.853
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE
THANKED YOU.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.889
HE'S GOT
THAT LOVE 'EM
AND LEAVE 'EM REP.

20:58.057 --> 20:58.991
I WAS JUST HOPING

20:59.058 --> 21:01.594
THAT MAYBE
I'D BE DIFFERENT.

21:01.661 --> 21:04.964
BUT, LAURA,
YOU ARE DIFFERENT.

21:05.031 --> 21:08.968
I WAS AFRAID
THAT HE'D REALIZE
THAT, TOO,

21:10.069 --> 21:12.705
AND THEN
I'D LOSE YOU.

21:12.772 --> 21:13.440
YOU NEVER HAD ME.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.975
LET'S NOT
SPLIT HAIRS.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.811
OKAY.

21:18.878 --> 21:22.415
STEVE, I OVERREACTED,
AND I'D LIKE YOU TO FORGIVE ME.

21:23.149 --> 21:26.886
WOW! AN APOLOGY?

21:26.953 --> 21:30.156
OH, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

21:30.222 --> 21:32.224
OH, I ACCEPT.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.027
[BLOWS NOSE LOUDLY]

21:35.094 --> 21:36.429
OH, YOU KNOW, LAURA,

21:36.496 --> 21:40.500
THIS IS A REALLY
SPECIAL MOMENT,
AND, WELL...

21:40.567 --> 21:43.603
I THINK
THAT WE SHOULD
CELEBRATE IT BY...

21:45.405 --> 21:46.939
GETTING MARRIED.

21:49.342 --> 21:50.009
NO.

21:50.076 --> 21:50.843
NO.
ENGAGED.

21:50.910 --> 21:51.878
NO.
GOING STEADY.

21:51.944 --> 21:54.180
NO, NO, NO.
A DATE? KISS?
HANDSHAKE?

21:54.246 --> 21:55.147
YEAH.
SEE YOU
TOMORROW?

21:55.214 --> 21:56.649
I'LL TAKE IT.
