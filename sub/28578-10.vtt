WEBVTT

00:09.943 --> 00:11.755
And now a message from

00:11.823 --> 00:13.613
the President
of the United States.

00:13.784 --> 00:17.188
My fellow Americans,
I would like to address reports

00:17.276 --> 00:18.443
alleging that I was friends

00:18.530 --> 00:22.443
with billionaire convicted
sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein

00:22.530 --> 00:24.693
and attended
his infamous parties.

00:24.780 --> 00:27.783
Sure, I told New York Magazine
in 2002

00:27.870 --> 00:29.693
that Epstein is a terrific guy.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.323
But that was before I found out

00:31.410 --> 00:33.470
that I said later
in the same sentence

00:33.558 --> 00:36.165
that he likes beautiful women
on the younger side.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.243
I knew I had to cut off
our relationship

00:38.330 --> 00:41.063
right then
and several years after there.

00:41.151 --> 00:43.743
Now, I've brought someone
who can confirm

00:43.831 --> 00:45.634
that we are very innocent.

00:45.722 --> 00:47.102
Hey, everybody.

00:47.190 --> 00:49.134
It's me,
America's cold sore.

00:49.222 --> 00:51.048
Every few years,
I pop up and remind you

00:51.136 --> 00:53.243
of your bad choices
in the nineties.

00:53.331 --> 00:57.063
I have never been to
Jeffrey Epstein's home

00:57.151 --> 01:00.727
on 71st Street between Fifth
and Madison near Jody's Juice.

01:00.815 --> 01:02.587
Try the strawberry.
It's delicious.

01:02.675 --> 01:04.735
And why would I go
to Epstein's home?

01:04.822 --> 01:07.321
I don't want to be reminded
of the things I've seen there.

01:07.409 --> 01:10.009
Let's talk about
the so-called "Epstein Jet"

01:10.097 --> 01:12.337
on which Jeffy-Boy
and his friends,

01:12.425 --> 01:14.712
who know him as Jeffy-Boy...
Jeffy-Boy!

01:14.800 --> 01:16.970
Allegedly committed
vile acts.

01:17.057 --> 01:19.590
Sure, witnesses allege
we were passengers,

01:19.677 --> 01:21.345
but so was Kevin Spacey.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.368
I don't think
this Boy Scout

01:23.456 --> 01:25.392
would let anything untoward
happen up there.

01:25.480 --> 01:27.784
The only reason
I was on that jet

01:27.872 --> 01:29.602
26... I mean, 4 times...

01:29.690 --> 01:32.829
Was it was the best deal
on Kayak.com

01:32.917 --> 01:36.501
And I promise I didn't smoke
a cigarette in the bathroom.

01:36.589 --> 01:38.790
Which is the only law
in the sky,

01:38.878 --> 01:40.702
according to our attorney
Alan Dershowitz.

01:40.789 --> 01:41.862
Dershy-Boy!

01:41.950 --> 01:44.371
He litigates like
his freedom depends on it.

01:44.459 --> 01:45.792
And it does.

01:45.879 --> 01:49.024
You know, Bill and I
may disagree on healthcare

01:49.112 --> 01:50.649
and criminal justice...
Barely.

01:50.737 --> 01:52.884
But we are
unified against

01:52.972 --> 01:55.081
these all-but-undeniable
accusations.

01:55.169 --> 01:57.940
In the end, aren't we all
just Americans

01:58.028 --> 02:00.941
accused of the most ghastly
crime imaginable?

02:01.089 --> 02:03.082
And on an unrelated note,
I am naming

02:03.169 --> 02:05.622
a new Deputy Attorney General...
Jeffrey Epstein.

02:05.709 --> 02:06.952
I'm also pardoning him

02:07.039 --> 02:08.698
and having his mouth
filled with cement.

02:08.786 --> 02:10.354
Don't you crack,
Jeffy-Boy!

02:10.443 --> 02:14.396
We're sending a rope and potato
chips down that well! I promise!

02:14.484 --> 02:17.397
- Bill, you're my best friend!
- And you're mine!

02:17.524 --> 02:19.817
We're gonna get through this
together, little brother!

02:19.905 --> 02:23.398
I can't believe we almost let
Hillary tear us apart!

02:23.499 --> 02:24.702
This has been a message from

02:24.790 --> 02:27.163
two Presidents
of the United States.

02:27.995 --> 02:29.462
- It's Joe's turn!
- There's

02:29.550 --> 02:32.401
not room for us both!
<font color=#FF00FF>*OUR CARTOON PRESIDENT*</font>

02:32.588 --> 02:35.581
<font color=#00FF00>Season 02  Episode 10</font>
Episode Title : <font color=#FFFF00>"Space Force"</font>

02:37.271 --> 02:39.558
Fifty years ago today,

02:39.646 --> 02:42.696
Buzz Aldrin
and a wise-ass talking monkey

02:42.784 --> 02:46.332
threw on some scuba gear,
boarded Apollo Creed,

02:46.419 --> 02:50.502
and shot up to the largest
of all our planets... the Moon.

02:50.589 --> 02:52.502
Buzz took some funny pictures,

02:52.589 --> 02:55.002
and NASA left the monkey to die.

02:55.089 --> 02:56.503
The end.

02:57.081 --> 02:59.858
Wait! Wait! Wait! Shut up!

03:00.031 --> 03:02.081
- Sir, is everything...
- Shhh!

03:02.379 --> 03:04.089
- It's just...
- Shhhhhhhh!

03:04.695 --> 03:06.791
Holy shit!
I forgot about...

03:06.879 --> 03:09.792
Sp-a-a-a-ce Fo-o-o-o-rce!

03:09.879 --> 03:12.800
Space Force! Space Force!
Space Force! Space Force!

03:13.253 --> 03:17.082
We gotta do Space Force!
What happened to Space Force?!

03:17.169 --> 03:20.026
You sort of went on an
obstruction-of-justice bender,

03:20.137 --> 03:21.510
so we kicked it
down the road.

03:21.598 --> 03:24.001
Mike, you garage-door
motor-brained moron!

03:24.089 --> 03:27.198
We could be blowing up stuff in
space right now, and instead...

03:27.286 --> 03:30.024
I'm commemorating
this Kirk Douglas-looking-ass

03:30.112 --> 03:31.126
space clown!

03:31.214 --> 03:32.987
Give me four hours,
and I'll have an update.

03:33.075 --> 03:34.925
Cool. Yeah.
Take your time.

03:35.039 --> 03:36.956
It's not like I'm your boss
or anything.

03:37.730 --> 03:38.662
I'm so excited!

03:38.749 --> 03:41.917
Are you excited? I'm excited!
Don't start. I gotta pee.

03:42.025 --> 03:43.337
It's starting! Forget it!

03:43.425 --> 03:44.815
I'll pee at halftime.

03:44.903 --> 03:47.486
Here is your update on
Space Force, an institution

03:47.574 --> 03:50.149
I fundamentally disagree with
as a science skeptic,

03:50.237 --> 03:52.571
but no one listened when
I explained that 17 times,

03:52.659 --> 03:53.662
so here we go.

03:53.749 --> 03:55.915
Whoo-hoo!
Space Force!

03:56.032 --> 03:59.321
Oh, man, I got to pee so bad.
I'm gonna pee in a cup!

03:59.409 --> 04:00.832
Next slide, please.

04:00.919 --> 04:03.673
The Defense Department's
legislative proposal outlines

04:03.761 --> 04:04.912
- a five-year rollout...
- Ah, geez.

04:04.999 --> 04:07.220
Beginning the start
of fiscal year 2020.

04:07.308 --> 04:08.892
The budget request is...

04:08.980 --> 04:10.524
Ugh.
$72.4 million...

04:10.612 --> 04:12.542
0.07% of the annual...

04:12.630 --> 04:14.331
- Ueeeghhh!
- D.O.D. budget.

04:14.419 --> 04:16.159
Mikey, I asked
for Star Wars,

04:16.247 --> 04:18.666
and you brought me
Star Wars: The Book!

04:18.755 --> 04:21.010
I've read some Star Wars books.
They're actually pretty good.

04:21.098 --> 04:23.121
Pompeo, you're
so far out of your lane

04:23.209 --> 04:24.862
that you've slammed
into a Roy Rogers.

04:24.950 --> 04:26.743
Here are the questions
I want answered.

04:26.831 --> 04:28.621
Will the rockets
have thick, red lasers?

04:28.709 --> 04:31.667
Will the astronauts be 500-pound
nutjobs with buzz cuts?

04:31.755 --> 04:34.038
Can we all get sweatshirts
that say "Space Force"?

04:34.162 --> 04:35.472
First, we need to lay

04:35.560 --> 04:37.702
the legislative and
budgetary groundwork.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.912
I'm so mad at you
right now!

04:39.999 --> 04:42.042
Everyone, make sure
Pence drinks this cup!

04:42.130 --> 04:45.151
"Groundwork."
What an asshole!

04:45.239 --> 04:46.673
Thank you all for attending

04:46.761 --> 04:50.622
the 2019 Iowa Democratic Party
Hall of Fame Dinner.

04:50.709 --> 04:52.888
See you at the Iowa Caucuses!

04:52.981 --> 04:55.308
What's the first thing you're
gonna do when you're president?

04:55.396 --> 04:57.621
I'm gonna give a speech
so lacking in substance

04:57.709 --> 05:00.384
that time freezes and I can
check out everyone's underpants.

05:00.472 --> 05:02.550
I'm gonna take off
these wool socks.

05:02.638 --> 05:05.196
Both my feet look like
the potato nobody buys

05:05.284 --> 05:07.662
because it's started to
sprout its own side potato.

05:07.749 --> 05:09.502
I'm gonna call
Al Franken and say,

05:09.589 --> 05:11.502
"Can you believe you're there
and I'm here?"

05:11.589 --> 05:13.071
You all think I'm gonna do

05:13.159 --> 05:16.370
some Native American
celebratory dance, but I won't.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.411
My tribe values quiet reflection
over revelry.

05:19.499 --> 05:21.629
I'm gonna kick back
and teach myself Welsh.

05:21.717 --> 05:25.720
I'm gonna bring in a pig,
tell my staff it's the mascot,

05:25.839 --> 05:27.042
let them pet it...

05:27.129 --> 05:29.502
then jam an iron rod through
its frickin' forehead!

05:29.589 --> 05:30.813
- Holy crap!
- Jesus, Amy!

05:30.901 --> 05:32.162
What is wrong with you?

05:32.249 --> 05:34.401
Ohh, so when a man

05:34.495 --> 05:36.470
slaughters a pig
in front of his staff...

05:36.558 --> 05:38.252
- No!
- That's your defense?!

05:38.339 --> 05:40.915
- What about you, Cory?
- Oh, thank you for asking.

05:41.018 --> 05:42.445
- I'm gonna...
- I'm just messin' with you.

05:42.533 --> 05:44.456
You're not
gonna be president!

05:45.135 --> 05:46.612
It's not funny!

05:46.925 --> 05:50.162
Good news is, one of us
will absolutely beat Trump,

05:50.249 --> 05:52.026
and nothing
will change that.

05:52.355 --> 05:54.048
Good news for
the White House tonight.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.642
President Trump's approval
rating is holding steady,

05:56.730 --> 05:58.602
and in key states,
he's running even

05:58.690 --> 06:00.752
with many
in the Democratic field.

06:02.761 --> 06:05.541
Daddy! I heard you made
Mike Pence drink pee!

06:05.629 --> 06:07.412
Did he try to wash
your feet again?

06:07.499 --> 06:10.024
Mike hasn't done a minute
of work on Space Force.

06:10.112 --> 06:12.384
This isn't like figuring out
which candy to keep

06:12.472 --> 06:13.837
in a steakhouse
men's room

06:13.925 --> 06:16.122
where you really got to
hunker down on the details.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.502
It's a space mission.

06:17.589 --> 06:21.202
I'll talk to him. Which Equinox
does he belong to again?

06:21.289 --> 06:22.332
Forget it. It's just...

06:22.419 --> 06:24.372
every time I try to do
something cool...

06:24.459 --> 06:26.407
Like the wall
or Muslim Ban...

06:26.495 --> 06:28.702
Some nerd has to come along
and talk my ear off

06:28.789 --> 06:31.452
about whether it's actually
possible, as if I care.

06:31.539 --> 06:32.912
Ugh! Samesies.

06:32.999 --> 06:35.292
I tried to turn Jared
into Channing Tatum

06:35.379 --> 06:36.952
by taping
human muscles to him,

06:37.039 --> 06:39.542
and some scientist was like,
"That won't work."

06:40.042 --> 06:42.298
Thanks for meeting
with us on short notice.

06:42.386 --> 06:43.698
We know you've got
a lot of shade

06:43.786 --> 06:45.136
and clapback
on your schedule.

06:45.224 --> 06:47.131
Everyone in my bubble
says Trump is doomed,

06:47.219 --> 06:48.632
but his poll numbers
are steady.

06:48.720 --> 06:51.133
What did you learn from your
loss that can help us beat him?

06:51.221 --> 06:52.726
I didn't lose.

06:52.814 --> 06:55.676
I won the popular vote
and the presidency.

06:55.764 --> 06:57.386
- Uhh...
- Uh, I-I... Uh...

06:57.474 --> 06:59.008
The 2020 campaign

06:59.096 --> 07:01.599
brought back some bad memories
that she's coped with

07:01.687 --> 07:03.600
by breaking off
into her own reality.

07:03.688 --> 07:05.351
One time,
I tried to wake her up,

07:05.439 --> 07:06.972
and she bit me
in the Adam's apple!

07:07.060 --> 07:08.063
I gotta kick you out.

07:08.151 --> 07:10.724
The "cabinet meeting"
is starting soon,

07:10.812 --> 07:13.315
and I gotta put suits and ties
on the cats.

07:13.403 --> 07:16.476
Bill, please remind
the Secretary of Education

07:16.564 --> 07:18.317
to stop licking
his asshole.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.778
This is some burden,
but I figure it's God

07:20.866 --> 07:24.677
punishing me for all the things
I did and continue to do.

07:24.796 --> 07:26.067
Secretary Fuzzy Wuzzy,

07:26.163 --> 07:30.091
I want boots on the ground
in Turkmenistan yesterday!

07:36.966 --> 07:38.763
You're watching
"Space Fighters:

07:38.851 --> 07:40.333
Thick Laser Edition."

07:40.443 --> 07:42.646
Hey, Mister
P-r-r-resident!

07:42.733 --> 07:45.226
I heard from someone
who has friends

07:45.313 --> 07:47.146
that you're giving up
on Space Force.

07:47.233 --> 07:49.870
Space Force is gonna be
our most awesome

07:49.958 --> 07:53.016
quagmire-generating
military branch yet!

07:53.103 --> 07:54.766
And we are not
just saying that

07:54.853 --> 07:56.653
because the defense
aeronautics industry

07:56.741 --> 07:59.194
digs us another
subterranean wine cave

07:59.282 --> 08:01.285
every time we utter
the word "rocket."

08:01.443 --> 08:02.896
Rocket, rocket, rocket!

08:02.983 --> 08:05.606
You really think Space Force
is worth more of my time

08:05.693 --> 08:08.106
than tricking Pompeo
into eating a caterpillar?

08:08.193 --> 08:10.766
Being the president
who launched Space Force

08:10.853 --> 08:13.020
would be pretty cool...

08:14.605 --> 08:17.645
Hey, aren't you the president
who started a military branch

08:17.733 --> 08:19.192
that's in friggin' space?

08:19.280 --> 08:20.693
- Guilty!
- Holy shit.

08:20.781 --> 08:22.958
The pizza's on me, sir.

08:23.304 --> 08:25.542
Hey, want to see what
the pepperonis look like

08:25.630 --> 08:26.726
before we chop 'em up?

08:26.813 --> 08:28.864
Goddamn right I do!

08:29.981 --> 08:31.804
Gentlemen...
I'll reconsider.

08:31.892 --> 08:34.725
Hoo-hoo-hoo! That's the spirit!
Can I do a mission?

08:34.813 --> 08:37.476
I can't wait to find out
what zero gravity does

08:37.563 --> 08:38.645
to my jowl meat!

08:38.732 --> 08:42.745
Blblblblblblb-oglglgl!
Blblblblblblb!

08:42.832 --> 08:45.020
Ted Cr-u-u-u-u-uz!

08:45.122 --> 08:48.035
Last night, I had a dream
that I won the nomination

08:48.123 --> 08:50.286
then lost all 50 states
to Trump.

08:50.374 --> 08:52.617
I couldn't get one
senator's wife to hug me!

08:52.705 --> 08:55.288
I had the same dream.
Except for the last part.

08:55.399 --> 08:56.662
- Me too.
- Yeah, except for that last part.

08:56.749 --> 08:58.698
Yeah, no, definitely

For some people,
it is complicated,

But this time
is gonna be different.

10:18.403 --> 10:21.316
not because it's easy...
Which it is, Mike...

Not because

Because that goal will allow us

why should you be

13:28.376 --> 13:30.280
President of the United States?

13:30.431 --> 13:32.634
Tonight ain't about why
you should vote for me...

13:32.728 --> 13:35.936
A man who Obama chained
to a radiator for eight years...

13:36.024 --> 13:38.218
But why you should vote

13:38.306 --> 13:41.046
I don't know, let's say,
overdue Medal of Honor recipient

13:41.134 --> 13:42.046
Pete Buttigieg!

13:42.134 --> 13:44.102
No, no, no.
Don't vote for me.

13:44.189 --> 13:46.522
I'm just trying to get a job
outside the Midwest.

My dear friend
Amy Klobuchar!

13:52.181 --> 13:54.692
Fuck you!
Don't vote for me.

13:54.779 --> 13:58.732

desk in case an intern sneezes!

13:58.819 --> 14:01.108
Elizabeth Warren,

14:01.196 --> 14:03.032

14:03.120 --> 14:04.851
Lizzy's not here right now!

14:04.939 --> 14:08.142

fire prince of the night,

14:08.229 --> 14:09.442
swallower of souls,

14:09.529 --> 14:12.812
and the last thing children see

14:12.899 --> 14:14.772
Actually, I would make
an excellent president,

14:14.859 --> 14:16.507
- and here's why...
- Shut up!

14:16.595 --> 14:18.501
You're the worst!

14:21.229 --> 14:23.142
What are we
watching here?

14:23.229 --> 14:25.759
- Doctors performing surgery?
- Wrong.

14:25.847 --> 14:28.665
We're watching doctors
not thinking.

14:28.779 --> 14:31.108
Thinking gets in the way
of your body doing

14:31.196 --> 14:33.642
what it innately
knows how to do.

14:33.813 --> 14:37.312
Yeah, I'm pretty sure they're
thinking while doing surgery.

14:37.399 --> 14:39.642
Maybe a better metaphor
would be, uh, figure skating?

14:39.729 --> 14:41.352
Figure skaters
have to think

14:41.439 --> 14:43.022
about every muscle
in their body.

14:43.109 --> 14:45.490
Space Force is like surgery...
Simple.

14:45.578 --> 14:48.192
We just jam a busty,
scorpion-shaped space shuttle

14:48.279 --> 14:50.062
into a cannon
and light the wick.

14:50.149 --> 14:52.998
Can it be a regular shuttle
with a curvaceous scorpion

14:53.086 --> 14:54.703
- painted on the side?
- Ugh!

14:54.797 --> 14:58.304
You're making the biggest
mistake of your life, but fine.

15:01.733 --> 15:03.836
Space Force in five...

15:03.929 --> 15:08.218
Four, three, two, one!

15:08.399 --> 15:10.522
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

15:10.609 --> 15:11.732
Here it goes!

15:11.859 --> 15:13.076
Why isn't it launching?!

15:13.164 --> 15:15.115
Because you just
started counting down

15:15.203 --> 15:17.442
irregardless
of the launch time.

15:18.578 --> 15:21.086
And that's when I knew
I would never be able

15:21.195 --> 15:24.257
to buy off-the-rack
socks again.

15:25.322 --> 15:28.437
Spppaaaace Foooorrrce!

15:31.359 --> 15:33.692
Don't explode, don't explode,
don't explode, don't explode.

15:33.779 --> 15:35.192
It didn't explode!

15:35.279 --> 15:37.442
Ha-ha!

15:37.960 --> 15:41.404
Mission control assures me
the rocket is dressed as a nun

15:41.492 --> 15:44.013
so no one suspects
it's about to kill someone.

15:44.101 --> 15:45.740
But this isn't just a victory

15:45.937 --> 15:48.591
for the good people
at Lockheed Martin, Boeing,

15:48.679 --> 15:51.692
and the now-rejuvenated
skull-shaped island market.

15:51.779 --> 15:54.140
It's a victory
for thoughtlessness.

15:54.228 --> 15:57.443
Like the Iraq War
or Obamacare website,

15:57.531 --> 15:59.037
from this moment forward,

15:59.125 --> 16:01.818
we will not
think things through!

16:01.906 --> 16:05.164
Mr. President, weren't both
of those massive failures?

16:05.252 --> 16:07.945
Iraq? No, that was pr...
No, that was pretty bad.

16:08.039 --> 16:09.601
That website, though... N...

16:09.689 --> 16:11.522
No, that...
That was bad, also.

16:11.609 --> 16:14.272
Uh, oh, uh, uh...
Can you excuse me?

16:14.359 --> 16:16.392
Shit-shit-shit-shit,
shit-shit-shit-shit-shit...

16:16.479 --> 16:19.709
A new poll
shows the floundering

16:19.797 --> 16:21.482
Democratic
presidential candidates

16:21.569 --> 16:23.774
all with 0% support.

16:23.862 --> 16:24.968

16:25.056 --> 16:26.419
Congratulations, kids.

16:26.507 --> 16:29.172
I wouldn't wish Hillary's fate
upon anyone.

16:29.260 --> 16:32.218
If you want to be
Secretary of Transportation,

16:32.344 --> 16:34.601
you need to let Mommy
give you a bath.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.102
On the Republican side,

16:36.189 --> 16:38.812
concern that President Trump
is leading the United States

16:38.899 --> 16:41.392
into a military quagmire
in space

16:41.479 --> 16:43.961
has caused his poll numbers
to slump.

16:44.467 --> 16:45.677
Hey, guys...

16:45.765 --> 16:48.209
what if Donald Trump
becomes vulnerable again?

16:48.297 --> 16:49.641
I told a bunch
of schoolchildren

16:49.729 --> 16:52.022
I was gonna cut off their
faces with a meat slicer.

16:52.109 --> 16:54.742
If Trump's unpopular
and we're unpopular,

16:54.830 --> 16:56.473
who is America
gonna vote for?

16:56.561 --> 16:58.966
Widespread opposition of
the major-party candidates

16:59.054 --> 17:02.061
has reactivated the campaign
of Starbucks CEO

17:02.149 --> 17:04.442
and nihilist sociopath
Howard Schultz.

17:04.561 --> 17:06.711
- Aaaaah!
- Nooooo!

17:07.372 --> 17:09.490
I don't
want to know. Is it bad?

17:09.578 --> 17:12.482
It's fine, as long
as the Chinese, Iranians,

17:12.569 --> 17:14.608
and North Koreans
play nice.

17:15.897 --> 17:18.248
Boom! Ha-ha!

17:18.336 --> 17:20.117
Felt that one
in my tailbone!

17:20.204 --> 17:22.340
Looks like you're
gonna need to send up

17:22.429 --> 17:23.973

17:24.061 --> 17:25.404
You guys look great!

17:25.492 --> 17:26.779
Where did you get
all that stuff?

17:26.867 --> 17:29.623
Our friends Lockheed and Martin
took us shopping!

17:29.711 --> 17:30.794
Unrelated to this.

17:30.882 --> 17:32.740
No further questions,
Your Honor.

17:32.828 --> 17:35.772
How quickly can we blast nine
more billion-dollar rockets

17:35.859 --> 17:37.609
into that powder keg
in the sky?

17:39.344 --> 17:42.211
The president just launched
more rockets into space...

17:42.299 --> 17:44.248
An escalation that,
history shows us,

17:44.374 --> 17:46.270
leads to an everlasting peace.

17:46.359 --> 17:48.522
Just kidding. It caused
a five-nation space war.

17:48.609 --> 17:51.240
Meanwhile, scientists warn
that space debris

17:51.328 --> 17:52.779
is falling at deadly speeds,

17:52.867 --> 17:54.852
just like the President's
poll numbers.

17:54.939 --> 17:58.022
Great. We just turned this
into a three-way race.

17:58.109 --> 18:01.193
I haven't felt this lousy
since Patty Murray pantsed me

18:01.281 --> 18:02.892
on my first day
in the Senate.

18:02.979 --> 18:05.318
Throwing this race
was a great idea, Amy.

18:05.406 --> 18:07.539
- I don't like that mouth at all!
- Whoa!

18:07.637 --> 18:09.136
- Hey, calm down!
- De-escalate!

18:10.688 --> 18:13.352
Are you...
expecting someone?

18:13.439 --> 18:14.818
No.

18:16.726 --> 18:18.524
That's not someone.

18:18.612 --> 18:20.367

18:45.658 --> 18:48.547
Holy shit! It's him! Hillary,
where do you keep your guns?!

18:48.635 --> 18:51.258
No guns, but I do have
the nuclear football.

18:51.346 --> 18:53.320
- Amy, get him!
- I looked him in the eye!

18:53.408 --> 18:54.812
I can't move!

18:54.899 --> 18:57.892
Behold the awesome
power of a centrist

18:57.979 --> 19:01.022
who appeals
to the 42% of Americans

19:01.109 --> 19:03.172
who identify
as independent.

19:03.260 --> 19:04.914
Those voters
could be independent

19:05.010 --> 19:07.023
because they're far left
or they're far right,

19:07.111 --> 19:08.592
you crazy-eyed bastard!

19:08.680 --> 19:10.425
Oh, yeah. Huh.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.692
Hm. It doesn't matter.

19:12.807 --> 19:16.174
By saturating Americans
with Starbucks for decades,

19:16.262 --> 19:18.311
I've primed them
to support a candidate

19:18.399 --> 19:20.482
who is just as
physically nauseating

19:20.569 --> 19:23.692
and economically criminal
as that terrible coffee.

19:23.779 --> 19:25.914
Americans are readier
than ever

19:26.002 --> 19:28.062
to get behind
something that sucks.

19:28.236 --> 19:31.142
They're ready for
Howard Schultz.

19:31.229 --> 19:34.424
Ha ha ha ha ha.
Ha ha ha ha ha.

19:37.489 --> 19:39.402
Well, I'm gonna punch out
for the day.

19:39.490 --> 19:41.726
If you guys need me,
I'll be just doing my thang.

19:41.814 --> 19:44.025
Oh, and, uh, if you left
your deck chairs outside,

19:44.113 --> 19:45.140
you might want to drag 'em in

19:45.228 --> 19:47.102
because it's really
coming down today.

19:47.189 --> 19:50.038
Sir, fiery metal chunks
traveling at the speed of sound

19:50.126 --> 19:51.765
are falling from space.
Oh, really?

19:51.853 --> 19:54.562
Well, are you sure Earth isn't
just going up into the chunks?

19:54.649 --> 19:55.772
I asked the same thing,

19:55.859 --> 19:58.022
but a guy with glasses
explained that it's not.

19:58.109 --> 20:00.461
I know, Pompeo. Okay?
You know why it's happening?

20:00.549 --> 20:01.992
Because you all spent
so much time

20:02.080 --> 20:03.991
focusing on the
Space Force details

20:04.079 --> 20:06.232
that you lost sight
of the overall awesomeness!

20:06.319 --> 20:08.942
Sir, this is why you always
need a backup plan.

20:09.029 --> 20:10.812
I thought
I banned the P-word!

20:10.899 --> 20:12.312
You know, launching a program

20:12.399 --> 20:14.442
that incites
an international arms race

20:14.529 --> 20:17.312
in a once-peaceful frontier
could've been fun!

20:17.399 --> 20:20.024
But you brainiacs ruined it!

20:27.540 --> 20:29.586
At least
pizza will cheer me up.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.139
- One slice of pepperoni, please.
- Not for you.

20:32.227 --> 20:33.795
My boss is making me
go up to the roof

20:33.883 --> 20:36.608
and clean up space junk thanks
to your brainless bullshit.

20:36.696 --> 20:39.350
Come on, man!
I've had a rough day.

20:39.438 --> 20:40.709
Just give me one?

20:40.797 --> 20:42.812
I'm gonna call the cops,
my dude. Take a hike.

20:42.899 --> 20:44.178
Fine. I'll go.

20:44.266 --> 20:46.314
But only if you show me
what the pepperonis look like

20:46.401 --> 20:47.344
before you chop 'em up.

20:47.432 --> 20:49.021
I'll take that secret
to my grave.

20:49.109 --> 20:51.102
Now beat it before
I kick your ass.

20:51.258 --> 20:53.022
Ugh! Not again!

20:53.109 --> 20:54.859
Jackie,
where's the broom?!

20:56.248 --> 20:59.415
Look, Howard, I respect what
you've done with Starbucks.

20:59.516 --> 21:01.352
No one drives their
employees insane

21:01.439 --> 21:03.392
with Norah Jones music
better than you.

21:03.479 --> 21:06.352
But if you run, hell, you'll
hand the presidency to Trump.

21:06.440 --> 21:10.063
Joe, what are you talking about?
I'm already the president.

21:10.189 --> 21:11.493
What?

21:11.979 --> 21:13.352
"Instead of
'billionaire, '

21:13.439 --> 21:16.243
I prefer you call me
a 'person of means.'

21:16.331 --> 21:18.382
President
Howard Schultz"?!

21:18.470 --> 21:20.032
I'm too late!

21:31.641 --> 21:33.100
And in political news,

21:33.188 --> 21:35.232
space junk continues
to kill thousands...

21:35.319 --> 21:37.232
and President Trump's
re-election chances.

21:37.319 --> 21:40.062
Maybe mankind just
wasn't meant to bring

21:40.149 --> 21:42.312
their mindless bloodlust
to the heavens.

21:42.546 --> 21:45.272
- Yes, they are.
- John F. Kennedy?

21:45.359 --> 21:48.312
You're Congressman
Joe Kennedy III's great-uncle!

21:48.399 --> 21:50.642
What's that silver-tongued
spitfire like?

21:50.729 --> 21:52.142
No time for chitchat.

21:52.229 --> 21:53.633
I'm just killing time
before I'm meeting

21:53.721 --> 21:56.352
the ghost of Jayne Mansfield
on Mike Pence's desk.

21:56.439 --> 21:57.942
When I announced
we'd go to the Moon,

21:58.029 --> 21:59.942
I had no idea
it was even possible.

22:00.029 --> 22:03.142
I was so goofed up on pain pills
that I just blurted it out,

22:03.229 --> 22:05.692
and, luckily, thousands
of eggheads made it happen.

22:05.779 --> 22:07.942
I wish Space Force
was like that.

22:08.029 --> 22:09.892
It is.
Just keep the faith.

22:09.979 --> 22:12.885
Us privileged white sons
of Nazi sympathizers

22:12.973 --> 22:15.651
need not concern ourselves
with details,

22:15.739 --> 22:18.221
because no matter
how great our errors,

22:18.309 --> 22:20.307
how harebrained our schemes,

22:20.395 --> 22:22.284
how depraved
our predilections,

22:22.372 --> 22:24.155
those who serve beneath us

22:24.242 --> 22:26.365
will provide
a nice, soft landing.

22:26.452 --> 22:28.401
Is there
a historical anecdote

22:28.489 --> 22:29.865
that illustrates
your exact point?

22:29.952 --> 22:31.856
Chappaquiddick.
Look it up.

22:31.992 --> 22:35.270
I had a dream last night
Schultz ate our souls!

22:35.358 --> 22:36.473
- Me too!
- Me too!

22:36.561 --> 22:39.044
We gotta stop him. Don't ask me
how. I'm a vague-ideas guy.

22:39.132 --> 22:41.630
We need someone smart,
someone who went to Stanford,

22:41.741 --> 22:44.296
won a Rhodes scholarship,
then attended Yale Law.

22:44.384 --> 22:45.577
- Oh, God.
- Shut up.

22:45.665 --> 22:49.486
This Schultz boob just jumped
into the race with no policies.

22:49.574 --> 22:51.489
If we want to go
toe-to-hoof with him,

22:51.577 --> 22:53.365
we need someone
equally thoughtless.

22:53.452 --> 22:54.249
She's right.

22:54.337 --> 22:56.614
Overthinking's what got us
into this mess,

22:56.702 --> 22:59.458
and underthinking
is gonna get us out.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.575
Hmm. Who do we know
that never puts

23:01.663 --> 23:03.952
a single thought
into anything they do?

23:06.412 --> 23:08.597
Wow! And then
he just went home?

23:08.685 --> 23:10.905
I'm not perfect,
but I'm not Ted Kennedy.

23:10.992 --> 23:12.785
I've made Jayne wait
long enough.

23:12.872 --> 23:14.535
By the way,
should you ever need

23:14.622 --> 23:17.535
the strongest barbiturates
known to medical science,

23:17.623 --> 23:20.411
look behind the painting
in the state dining room.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.411
If that's Jackie, uh,

23:22.499 --> 23:24.888
tell her I'm fighting for
civil rights or some crap.

23:24.992 --> 23:27.513
Hello?
Every one of 'em?

23:29.653 --> 23:33.648
And behind Howard Schultz's
eyes, it's completely black.

23:33.736 --> 23:35.970
He doesn't feel
like you and me.

23:36.058 --> 23:37.314
He's got acid for blood!

23:37.452 --> 23:39.890
Why would I team up with
you guys to take him down?

23:39.978 --> 23:41.663
You really want
to go mano-a-mano

23:41.751 --> 23:44.642
with someone who thought less
about their campaign than you?

23:44.773 --> 23:46.484
Alright.
Follow my lead,

23:46.572 --> 23:50.038
even though I have the barest
wisp of an idea where I'm going.

23:50.158 --> 23:53.970
♪ Space Force, yeah! ♪

23:56.371 --> 23:58.459
♪ Space Force! ♪

23:58.629 --> 24:00.553
♪♪♪

24:00.641 --> 24:02.285
♪ Space Force! ♪

24:05.037 --> 24:06.918
So each
and every one of you

24:07.006 --> 24:09.535
is dropping out of the race
and endorsing me?

24:09.623 --> 24:11.075
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh-huh.

24:11.162 --> 24:13.825
I figured it would come to this,
just not so soon.

24:13.912 --> 24:17.675
How about some...
Starbucks to celebrate?

24:17.763 --> 24:20.068
How thoughtful.
Anyone else gonna partake?

24:20.156 --> 24:21.156
- Nope.
- No.

24:21.243 --> 24:22.818
Okay.

24:24.529 --> 24:26.655
Ahh. This was lovely.

24:26.742 --> 24:28.285
I'll be back
with my designers

24:28.372 --> 24:29.894
who specialize
in interiors

24:29.982 --> 24:32.445
that, once you enter,
you immediately want to leave.

24:32.532 --> 24:36.575
Idiot! I put JFK's horse
tranquilizers in that coffee!

24:36.662 --> 24:40.050
And as soon as you pass out,
we're shooting you into space!

24:40.138 --> 24:42.511
- Whoo-hoo!
- Take that, asshole!

24:42.800 --> 24:44.503
Why aren't you panicking?

24:44.591 --> 24:48.130
Starbucks coffee is so acidic
that it neutralizes the effects

24:48.218 --> 24:50.648
of even the most dangerous
barbiturates.

24:50.736 --> 24:53.794
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna have you arrested

24:53.882 --> 24:56.390
for conspiracy to be mean
to a billionaire.

24:56.485 --> 24:58.188
Don't you mean
"person of means"?

24:58.276 --> 25:01.559
"Billionaire" is my word.
I can say it.

25:02.499 --> 25:04.366
Okay, Trump.
What's your Plan B?

25:04.454 --> 25:06.771
Aww. You thought
I had a Plan A.

25:06.859 --> 25:08.495
You're alright, Lizzy.

25:08.663 --> 25:11.155
Well, I guess this is it
for all of us.

25:11.242 --> 25:13.323
If you guys want to take
anything from the White House,

25:13.410 --> 25:14.836
I got a crowbar in my desk.

25:14.924 --> 25:17.258
- Wait. But what if we just...
- It's over, Beto.

25:17.346 --> 25:19.664
Times like these, I feel
more grateful than ever

25:19.752 --> 25:20.758
that I have
a girlfriend.

25:20.846 --> 25:23.252
- She doesn't exist!
- Shut up!

25:24.482 --> 25:27.185
Take me to the sheriff's office.
No lollygagging.

25:27.273 --> 25:29.364
Right away,
future president.

25:29.452 --> 25:31.596
Finally.
Someone gets it.

25:33.283 --> 25:35.031
What the hell
are we doing out here?

25:35.119 --> 25:37.750
The pawn shop closes
in 45 minutes.

25:37.838 --> 25:40.601
Sir, I knew you wouldn't
have a backup plan

25:40.689 --> 25:42.195
to take down
Howard Schultz,

25:42.282 --> 25:45.047
and Earth would fly off orbit
into the sun

25:45.135 --> 25:48.361
if Americans lost faith
in their doughy, white men.

25:48.449 --> 25:51.322
So I came up with a plan
myself.

25:51.449 --> 25:53.534
Please direct your attention
to the distance,

25:53.622 --> 25:55.914
where the hog-tied
coffee magnate

25:56.002 --> 25:58.535
is loaded into a rocket
headed for space

25:58.622 --> 26:01.461
in three, two, one!

26:01.549 --> 26:02.905
Blast off!

26:02.992 --> 26:06.478
- Whoo-hoo!
- Spaaaace Foooorrrce!

26:06.662 --> 26:09.023
Please explode, please explode,
please explode.

26:09.111 --> 26:11.825
- Whoo!
- Aww, it didn't explode!

26:11.912 --> 26:14.195
Not that I have a problem
with someone being

26:14.282 --> 26:15.937
in a confined space
indefinitely,

26:16.025 --> 26:18.533
but aren't we kind of
leaving Schultz to die in space?

26:18.621 --> 26:20.875
Oh, he has enough water
and gerbil pellets

26:20.963 --> 26:23.625
to last him well past
the 2020 election.

26:23.713 --> 26:25.626
Doesn't China, Iran,
and North Korea

26:25.714 --> 26:27.824
have militarized
spacecrafts up there?

26:27.912 --> 26:29.745
I read that in
a French newspaper!

26:29.832 --> 26:31.103
Oh, yeah!

26:34.836 --> 26:38.072
But on the other hand,
pretty big-ass explosion, right?

26:38.160 --> 26:39.573
- Yeah!
- What a beautiful sight!

26:39.686 --> 26:41.635
Plus,
you blew up a rocket.

26:41.728 --> 26:45.115
And when a rocket explodes
and you need more rockets,

26:45.202 --> 26:47.405
it's a beautiful thing.

26:47.492 --> 26:49.947
You guys look so good.

26:51.539 --> 26:53.613
You can't kill Howard Schultz.

26:53.701 --> 26:56.404
I was here
before the world began.

26:56.492 --> 26:59.871
Ha ha ha ha. Ha.

27:00.135 --> 27:02.753
We felt bad Space Force
didn't work out

27:02.841 --> 27:05.254
because you're crazy dumb,
so we got you this.

27:05.342 --> 27:06.457
You know what?

27:06.545 --> 27:09.824
A cool sweatshirt is all
I wanted the whole time.

27:09.912 --> 27:12.165
We'll, uh, see you
on the campaign trail?

27:12.253 --> 27:16.144
Yep! Until one of you wins,
I declare the election invalid,

27:16.232 --> 27:18.497
and we settle this
in the streets.
