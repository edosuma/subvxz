WEBVTT

00:15.767 --> 00:19.033
On this episode
of Parker's Trail.

00:19.066 --> 00:20.967
We're trying to
expand into Alaska.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.233
It's good timing
to make this trip.

00:23.266 --> 00:24.667
New Zealand's awesome,

00:24.700 --> 00:26.734
so I'm looking forward
to actually, like,

00:26.767 --> 00:28.433
digging into the country
and checking it out.

00:28.467 --> 00:30.000
Checking out the mining
that's going on.

00:30.033 --> 00:31.867
Check out the gold
they're finding.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.467
It looks like you got
a bit of ground here.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.900
- That's really nice.
- Yeah.

00:43.934 --> 00:45.533
I really like this plant.

00:52.467 --> 00:54.000
There is some gold in there.

00:54.033 --> 00:54.834
Yup.

00:55.567 --> 00:57.200
That is wicked.

00:57.233 --> 00:59.066
They're mining
super-efficient.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.000
They're all getting rich.

01:01.734 --> 01:02.900
Oh, yeah.

01:04.367 --> 01:06.400
That's awesome. Look at that.

01:06.433 --> 01:07.233
Awesome.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.200
Hope this is the right way.

01:32.233 --> 01:33.600
Tyler,
this is not a road.

01:33.634 --> 01:34.734
Yeah.

01:34.767 --> 01:36.233
This is an old dirt track.

01:37.266 --> 01:39.333
Parker Schnabel
and his crew,

01:39.367 --> 01:41.300
Danny Etheridge, Tyler Mahoney

01:41.333 --> 01:43.700
and new recruit,
wash plant engineer,

01:43.734 --> 01:44.667
Jeff Turnell

01:44.700 --> 01:46.600
are on the search for a plant

01:46.634 --> 01:48.900
in the home
of mining innovation,

01:48.934 --> 01:50.333
New Zealand.

01:50.367 --> 01:53.567
To get it back to the States
in time for the season,

01:53.600 --> 01:55.533
Parker has just seven weeks

01:55.567 --> 01:57.767
to find a needle
in a haystack.

01:59.166 --> 02:00.500
So,
this is a shortcut.

02:00.533 --> 02:01.734
Who's there?

02:01.767 --> 02:03.300
He's a local miner

02:03.333 --> 02:04.934
and he's got
a wash plant for sale.

02:06.266 --> 02:07.734
The team begin
their search

02:07.767 --> 02:10.967
on the south island's
gold rich west coast.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.367
For their first stop,

02:12.400 --> 02:15.166
they're heading
204 miles south

02:15.200 --> 02:18.166
to a claim near
the historic mining town

02:18.200 --> 02:19.400
of Hokitika.

02:21.867 --> 02:26.400
So, Iain has given me
a pin for his location.

02:26.433 --> 02:29.834
I think we're gonna
have to pass through
some old tunnels to get there.

02:29.867 --> 02:31.367
Like, train tunnels?

02:31.400 --> 02:33.600
No, like, tunnels
from the old gold miners.

02:35.634 --> 02:37.166
Guys.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.800
- This is clearly the wrong way.
- Yeah.

02:39.834 --> 02:43.233
- Relax... Guys.
- What do you mean relax?

02:43.266 --> 02:45.867
Parker just tasked me
with finding the contacts.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.634
But yeah, it's proven
hard in New Zealand,

02:47.667 --> 02:49.100
people are secretive,
you know.

02:49.133 --> 02:51.667
It's the gold game.
Everyone likes to keep
their cards close to them.

02:51.700 --> 02:54.066
I also did not have much time
to set this trip up.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.200
It was very rushed.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.333
Left or right?

02:58.634 --> 03:00.367
Go straight through there.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.834
- Straight through here.
- Yeah.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.667
Oh, my
That's it, there.

03:14.567 --> 03:16.600
Oh, my

03:18.233 --> 03:20.533
We're going in there?

03:20.567 --> 03:22.867
Wait, wait! Hang on a minute.
Whoa, whoa. Jeff, Jeff.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.433
Stop!
It's like a river.

03:25.467 --> 03:28.133
It looks deep
on this right hand side.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.133
We should check it.

03:29.166 --> 03:30.533
Tyler has boots on.

03:30.567 --> 03:31.467
Go on, Ty.

03:35.200 --> 03:37.834
- I don't know.
- It's dark on the right there.

03:37.867 --> 03:38.700
So, what's
the conclusion?

03:38.734 --> 03:39.900
We're actually
going through that?

03:39.934 --> 03:42.000
I think so.
And just stay
to the left, yeah.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.533
Okay, we're gonna
get stuck in here.

03:47.567 --> 03:48.900
Okay, okay, okay.

03:48.934 --> 03:50.700
You need to be the one
that's confident, Jeff.

03:51.367 --> 03:53.133
All right. Are we ready?

03:53.166 --> 03:54.767
- No.
- Stay left, Jeff.

04:07.734 --> 04:08.867
That's too deep.

04:13.634 --> 04:15.634
Oh, my Oh, my!

04:15.667 --> 04:17.367
Shh... Oh.

04:20.467 --> 04:22.300
This is like Indiana Jones.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.000
- Wow!
- That is cool.

04:24.767 --> 04:26.166
So, this is all
handmade, right?

04:26.200 --> 04:28.800
Yeah.
By the old timers in 1870s.

04:29.767 --> 04:31.934
Built in 1878,

04:31.967 --> 04:34.233
miners hand dug the tunnels

04:34.266 --> 04:36.400
to divert the original creek

04:36.433 --> 04:39.033
and expose gold-rich ground.

04:39.066 --> 04:40.567
This area has produced

04:40.600 --> 04:43.600
750,000 ounces of gold,

04:43.634 --> 04:46.433
worth today
over a billion dollars.

04:49.734 --> 04:51.500
Oh, yeah!

04:51.533 --> 04:52.734
Good idea, Jeff.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.233
Yeah.

04:54.266 --> 04:55.800
Look at the layers.

04:55.834 --> 04:57.133
Yeah.

04:57.166 --> 05:00.900
See, that would be like a,
it looks like a sand layer.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.400
Look at that.

05:03.433 --> 05:05.600
This is like,
the prettiest place
I've ever seen.

05:05.634 --> 05:07.066
Yeah. Yeah.

05:07.100 --> 05:08.767
I'm just waiting
for the dinosaurs.

05:08.800 --> 05:10.734
I feel like
I'm in Jurassic Park.

05:13.867 --> 05:14.900
Oh, we have to go up there.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.667
- Oh, absolutely not.
- What?

05:20.066 --> 05:21.734
That's steep.

05:24.600 --> 05:28.033
Like, I can't even stop, like,
once we set spinning
out on this.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.333
I believe in you, Jeff.

05:30.934 --> 05:32.333
Ban the hatches, Dan.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.433
Easy, boy.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.333
Wow!

05:52.266 --> 05:53.400
Nearly, eh?

05:53.433 --> 05:54.800
Oh, so close.

05:54.834 --> 05:56.867
- Very close.
- We're definitely in a hole now.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.200
- Where's the winch control.
- I don't know. I'm trying to find it.

06:01.233 --> 06:03.100
I reckon
it's in that back drawer.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.333
Is it in there?

06:08.166 --> 06:09.433
No, this is a tool box.

06:11.967 --> 06:13.567
Do you need help?

06:13.600 --> 06:16.200
Ah, Tyler.

06:16.233 --> 06:18.467
This is why you
always test your equipment

06:18.500 --> 06:19.700
before you go.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.233
He's right.

06:22.634 --> 06:24.867
The only other place
we haven't looked

06:24.900 --> 06:26.967
is in that little
side compartment on this side.

06:27.934 --> 06:28.834
Let's try that.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.300
Here we go.

06:33.967 --> 06:35.200
There it is!

06:35.867 --> 06:37.600
Yeah! Come on!

06:37.634 --> 06:39.800
Hey, this literally feels
like Jurassic Park now.

06:43.634 --> 06:44.900
Get ready to fire up.

06:47.367 --> 06:48.967
Oh, yeah! Go on!

06:50.266 --> 06:51.433
Get it!

06:51.467 --> 06:52.834
Go on!

06:53.800 --> 06:55.634
- Come on!
- Get it!

06:57.033 --> 06:58.066
Go, Jeff!

06:58.533 --> 07:00.233
Oh, yes!

07:00.266 --> 07:02.433
- Woo-hoo!
- Get in there.

07:02.467 --> 07:03.567
Nice!

07:03.600 --> 07:04.700
Well done, Jeff.

07:05.533 --> 07:07.533
That was awesome.

07:07.567 --> 07:10.667
Some shortcut.
There's probably
about another eight of these.

07:10.700 --> 07:12.567
Maybe we should keep
this somewhere we know
where it is now.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.500
Yeah, I would.

07:13.533 --> 07:14.567
Woo!

07:19.634 --> 07:22.000
After a four
and a half hour journey,

07:23.400 --> 07:25.900
the team finally
hit the gold fields

07:25.934 --> 07:27.967
of Hokitika.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.266
So, the guy who
we're about to see,
Iain Whyte.

07:30.300 --> 07:34.300
He has lots of cool technology
here that is concentrating
on finding fine gold.

07:34.333 --> 07:37.934
And separating it
from the blacks
and it refines.

07:37.967 --> 07:39.300
He hasn't told me a lot,
to be honest.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.533
But from what I can gather
he knows what he's doing.

07:41.567 --> 07:42.367
Good stuff.

07:43.400 --> 07:46.867
Founded
on gold mining in 1864,

07:46.900 --> 07:50.000
Hokitika was at the heart
of the west coast gold rush.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.634
By 1866,

07:52.667 --> 07:55.700
it was one of New Zealand's
most populous areas.

07:55.734 --> 07:57.433
And home to some
of the country's

07:57.467 --> 07:59.433
most successful gold fields.

07:59.467 --> 08:02.133
In total,
the west coast has produced

08:02.166 --> 08:05.066
almost nine million ounces
in gold.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.500
Beautiful place
to work.

08:09.166 --> 08:10.734
- Oh, there he is.
- Oh.

08:10.767 --> 08:13.934
Now,
almost an 160 years later,

08:13.967 --> 08:16.000
miners like Iain Whyte...

08:16.033 --> 08:16.900
How's it going?

08:19.433 --> 08:21.500
...are still
finding the gold

08:21.533 --> 08:23.700
with state-of-the-art
equipment.

08:23.734 --> 08:25.300
It looks like you got
a bit of ground here.

08:29.233 --> 08:30.033
Right.

08:33.467 --> 08:35.767
But yeah, thanks for agreeing
to meet with us.

08:35.800 --> 08:38.200
- Yeah.
- We're looking at buying a wash plant.

08:38.233 --> 08:39.233
Yeah.

08:42.667 --> 08:43.734
Yeah, that'd be great.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.166
With over
45 years' experience

08:52.200 --> 08:54.667
spanning three continents,

08:54.700 --> 08:57.934
Iain is one of the most
successful miners
in New Zealand.

08:59.233 --> 09:00.300
They're big.

09:02.100 --> 09:05.000
He's been
working this 44 acre plain

09:05.033 --> 09:06.634
since 2019.

09:09.734 --> 09:10.700
Yeah,
that'd be great.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.734
How long
have you been in this spot?

09:23.367 --> 09:25.567
The ground here
from what I know,

09:25.600 --> 09:27.900
it's fairly similar in Alaska.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.934
In that, like,
the ground that's left,

09:29.967 --> 09:32.166
- a lot of it is deeper ground.
- Yeah.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.634
And then you'll take

09:33.667 --> 09:35.433
probably not even
anytime soon,

09:35.467 --> 09:38.200
but you'll take a strip off
that whole side then, huh?

09:58.634 --> 09:59.500
Right.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.567
- Right. Should we go check out the plant?
- Yeah.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.367
Right.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.834
- 'Cause these have hydraulics on them, huh?
- Yeah.

10:18.333 --> 10:21.867
Iain is offering up
a pair of five-foot trommels

10:21.900 --> 10:24.166
that runs side-by-side

10:24.200 --> 10:29.100
and can churn through
a 160 yards of gold rich pay
per hour.

10:29.133 --> 10:32.400
And have a price tag
of $200,000.

10:36.400 --> 10:40.467
So, why run two plants
side-by-side

10:40.500 --> 10:42.233
instead of one big one?

10:56.433 --> 10:57.233
Right.

11:02.867 --> 11:03.667
Right.

11:04.767 --> 11:07.133
A saving
of 30 minutes

11:07.166 --> 11:08.700
every 12 hours,

11:08.734 --> 11:12.800
could amount to extra
$500,000 a season

11:12.834 --> 11:15.100
for Parker in Alaska.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.400
All right.
Well, mind if I have a go?

11:22.266 --> 11:23.300
Sweet.

11:23.333 --> 11:25.867
And what kind of, like,
a bucket per minute or?

11:27.667 --> 11:28.500
Okay.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.200
All right.

11:45.734 --> 11:46.934
First bucket.

11:51.133 --> 11:53.300
This is
a cool operation.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.867
Minds like Iain's are why
I came to New Zealand.

12:18.133 --> 12:20.333
Cheating?

12:31.900 --> 12:35.033
Really glad that Iain let us
come here because

12:35.066 --> 12:36.600
this is a cool operation.

12:37.834 --> 12:40.734
In the gold fields
of Hokitika, New Zealand,

12:40.767 --> 12:43.500
Parker is testing out
a double trommel setup.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.333
We're definitely gonna be able
to get some really
good ideas here.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.533
I think that all
New Zealanders that are miners

12:49.567 --> 12:51.767
really put a lot of effort
into thinking about

12:51.800 --> 12:53.467
what they're doing
and why they're doing it.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.500
And Iain's obviously
a thinker.

13:15.367 --> 13:16.967
Um, yeah. I mean,
this seems like

13:17.000 --> 13:18.133
a pretty good setup,

13:18.166 --> 13:19.967
But running two small plants,

13:20.000 --> 13:23.200
isn't something
I'd really consider
for my current operation.

13:25.033 --> 13:26.767
I get the reasoning behind it.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.700
Having two smaller plants,

13:28.734 --> 13:31.033
it's really no different
than having one big plant.

13:31.066 --> 13:31.867
Except...

13:33.667 --> 13:36.634
the odds of having both plants
break down are pretty slim,

13:36.667 --> 13:39.266
so you'll always be
able to keep running. Right?

13:39.300 --> 13:40.967
It's definitely making me
think about

13:41.000 --> 13:43.033
the two wash plant things.

13:43.066 --> 13:44.867
And the yardage
for these two plants

13:44.900 --> 13:48.000
is about the kind of yardage
that we're aiming for,

13:48.033 --> 13:49.934
so the yardage works.

13:51.567 --> 13:55.133
Parker needs to run
at least 150 yards an hour

13:55.166 --> 13:57.033
at his Alaska operation.

13:57.066 --> 13:59.967
If he can maintain that pace
or beat it,

14:00.066 --> 14:01.667
he could mine out the claim

14:01.700 --> 14:03.967
and bank the $11 million

14:04.000 --> 14:06.233
estimated to be in the ground.

14:06.266 --> 14:08.367
They're very short
loose boxes, Jeff.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.467
Yes, they are.

14:09.500 --> 14:10.667
The only way you can do that

14:10.700 --> 14:12.500
is by having
hydraulic riffles.

14:12.533 --> 14:15.834
- So, if you reach in here...
- Yeah.

14:15.867 --> 14:17.900
And you can feel that
the material is loose?

14:18.433 --> 14:19.533
Oh, yeah.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.634
So, now come down
to the Hungarian riffles.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.000
Feel, it's harder.

14:23.033 --> 14:27.300
So, that's the difference
between Hungarian
and hydraulic riffle.

14:27.333 --> 14:29.000
In Hungarian riffles,

14:29.033 --> 14:31.000
the iron angles in the sluice

14:31.033 --> 14:34.367
create a swirling vortex
that agitates the dirt

14:34.400 --> 14:36.634
and catches the heavier gold.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.500
Whereas, hydraulic riffles
stir the material

14:39.533 --> 14:40.967
with water injection.

14:41.834 --> 14:43.367
On this
particular plant,

14:43.400 --> 14:45.734
80 percent
of its recovery is here.

14:45.767 --> 14:48.800
And additional
ten percent here.

14:48.834 --> 14:50.300
Anywhere from
four to six months,

14:50.333 --> 14:51.500
he'll clean the end.

14:51.533 --> 14:54.467
And he's cleaning up here
every day or two,

14:54.500 --> 14:55.934
depending on how much
material he's running

14:55.967 --> 14:57.233
and how long he's running.

14:57.266 --> 14:58.634
That's key because,

14:58.667 --> 15:00.734
you know, over the course
of a mining season,

15:00.767 --> 15:02.500
you know, that's down time.

15:02.533 --> 15:05.934
And it's key to have the most
you put through your plants

15:05.967 --> 15:07.000
in a mining season.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.800
Hydraulic riffles
also allows

15:09.834 --> 15:11.533
for shorter sluice runs

15:11.567 --> 15:13.533
which could mean
faster cleanups.

15:13.567 --> 15:15.867
Perfect for Parker's
Alaska operation.

15:18.433 --> 15:21.333
Oh, it's really good seeing
a miner like Iain,

15:21.367 --> 15:23.600
you know, he's really
just shaving seconds

15:23.634 --> 15:25.634
off of each hour.

15:25.667 --> 15:26.667
And at the end of the year

15:26.700 --> 15:28.800
that adds up to be
a lot of time.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.867
Having Jeff
here is great.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.600
It kinda takes
the pressure off my back

15:35.634 --> 15:37.100
'cause wash plants
aren't my thing.

15:37.133 --> 15:40.233
The fact he's here
and he's all over
that side of things,

15:40.266 --> 15:43.100
it's one less thing
that I have to worry about.

15:43.133 --> 15:45.600
So now I can concentrate
on finding new contacts.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.333
Hey, how are you?

15:52.367 --> 15:53.767
Yeah, I'm good. Good.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.467
Thank you for getting
back to me.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.967
I was just hoping that maybe
you wouldn't mind

15:58.000 --> 15:59.800
if we headed up to your site

15:59.834 --> 16:02.133
and put some
wash plants and...

16:02.166 --> 16:03.100
Hello?

16:04.200 --> 16:05.533
H... Hello?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.333
Yes, sorry.
I can just hear you.

16:12.367 --> 16:13.567
You're just breaking up
a little bit.

16:16.233 --> 16:18.533
Yeah, I don't think tailings
for these plants

16:18.567 --> 16:19.967
would be a full time job.

16:21.066 --> 16:22.834
Tyler's doing
tailings right now.

16:22.867 --> 16:24.700
But it's probably
something where

16:24.734 --> 16:27.233
the loader operator
also helping

16:27.266 --> 16:30.500
get the material close enough
to the plants more.

16:33.233 --> 16:34.400
Sweet. Okay, thank you.

16:39.767 --> 16:40.700
Oh

16:42.834 --> 16:44.367
Oh

16:46.367 --> 16:48.033
that was
so stupid.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.400
Parker has 100 percent
noticed that.

17:07.634 --> 17:10.100
Hurry up, Tyler.
I've got a box walk free.

17:10.500 --> 17:11.500
Yeah. Roger.

17:17.667 --> 17:20.767
That's like, number one rule
when you're in the loaders,

17:20.800 --> 17:22.433
don't let the tailings
back up.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.066
I hope Iain hasn't seen that.

17:26.266 --> 17:28.867
But the phone call
was actually a positive.

17:28.900 --> 17:32.233
I've been trying to get a hold
of Ben for literally days now.

17:32.266 --> 17:34.133
Ben's got a wash plant
for sale.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.900
That's a positive
if I can make it happen.

17:41.400 --> 17:43.066
How're you going, up there?

17:43.100 --> 17:45.100
Yeah, just peachy.

17:45.133 --> 17:46.567
I figured
if it was really bad,

17:46.600 --> 17:47.900
somebody would have
said something.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.367
Yeah, fair enough.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.567
What are your
thoughts on the two
wash plants?

17:54.767 --> 17:56.867
I don't know.
Lot of moving parts.

17:58.600 --> 17:59.967
I think probably
the only thing

18:00.066 --> 18:02.934
I really don't like
about this is the...

18:04.467 --> 18:05.533
the feed.

18:07.300 --> 18:08.767
Feeding two plants,

18:08.800 --> 18:11.500
you pretty much have to
excavator feed them.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.700
Excavator feeding

18:13.734 --> 18:15.467
makes things easy.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.567
But I just... I like to take

18:17.600 --> 18:20.166
the human element
out of the consistency

18:20.200 --> 18:21.500
of the feed to a plant.

18:21.533 --> 18:24.333
And our big line of
conveyors and feeders do that.

18:26.133 --> 18:28.634
You can conveyor feed
into two separate plants,

18:28.667 --> 18:30.400
but it takes this
big splitter bin

18:30.433 --> 18:32.867
to split the material from
one conveyor belt going in

18:32.900 --> 18:34.433
into two separate feeds

18:34.467 --> 18:35.867
and the two separate plants.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.634
I've never seen
one of those work,

18:38.433 --> 18:39.834
like I've seen them not work.

18:49.934 --> 18:50.900
Hey, Danny.

18:50.934 --> 18:53.333
I'm noticing, there's another
plant being fed.

18:53.367 --> 18:54.567
Oh, yeah.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.100
Across the claim,

18:56.133 --> 18:58.533
Jeff and Danny
find the real reason

18:58.567 --> 19:01.367
Iain is selling
his double trommel.

19:01.400 --> 19:02.700
That one looks fresh.

19:02.734 --> 19:04.133
I'm liking
what I'm seeing here.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.333
- Oh, nice!
- Yeah!

19:07.367 --> 19:09.533
She's beautiful. Brand new.

19:10.634 --> 19:12.634
It's got a base hopper.

19:13.767 --> 19:16.467
Six-foot trommel. Check.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.367
And this is
pretty unique here.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.133
It's got a bit of a primary
catch tray

19:20.166 --> 19:22.367
that can lower down
with hydraulics here.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.533
I'd like to see what this
looks like once it shuts down.

19:25.567 --> 19:27.166
And I can see
hydraulic riffle,

19:27.200 --> 19:29.500
so this is what
we're looking for.

19:29.533 --> 19:30.400
Right here.

19:31.233 --> 19:32.433
We should
go find Parker.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.834
Iain's just
turned off the pump.

19:38.867 --> 19:40.867
Parker's about to park up.

19:40.900 --> 19:42.600
I think we're wrapping up
for the day.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.634
Is there
any gold in it?

19:47.967 --> 19:50.600
Your plant operator
is probably throwing
all the gold away.

19:53.467 --> 19:54.300
Yeah.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.533
I'm totally with you
on hydraulics. I love 'em.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.066
Parker is used to using
Hungarian riffles.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.800
And on this plant,

20:04.834 --> 20:06.500
there's hydraulic riffles

20:06.533 --> 20:09.166
and that's something I'd like
to kind of move him towards.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.934
I know it's gonna
take a little convincing.

20:10.967 --> 20:13.367
But if it's ran properly
and it's done properly,

20:13.400 --> 20:17.233
it can be a big time saver
for cleanups sort of season.

20:17.266 --> 20:20.367
Um, that is just
finicky, you know.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.800
Like, too much water pressure
blows everything out of 'em.

20:22.834 --> 20:25.100
Not enough, they're packing up
super tight.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.200
Myself and Jeff were having
a little look round.

20:39.500 --> 20:42.734
We spotted a nice
kinda new looking

20:42.767 --> 20:43.967
six-foot trommel.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.166
Yeah. Parker,
it's wicked, I really like it.

20:55.200 --> 20:58.533
I think there's gonna be some
good stuff on here
for you to see.

20:58.567 --> 20:59.700
Mind if I
check it out?

21:04.867 --> 21:05.734
Let's get over there.

21:13.000 --> 21:13.934
It's quiet.

21:16.433 --> 21:17.834
- Really quiet.
- Yeah.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.533
Iain's compact
six-foot super trommel

21:46.567 --> 21:50.367
can run 235 yards
of dirt per hour

21:50.400 --> 21:53.800
and is custom built
for fine gold recovery.

21:53.834 --> 21:58.033
A one of a kind
hydraulic powered
catch tray drops down.

21:58.066 --> 22:02.133
Allowing for up to 70 percent
of Iain's gold to be
cleaned up

22:02.166 --> 22:04.867
in a quick
ten minute shutdown.

22:04.900 --> 22:10.367
An innovation,
which can save Parker days
in downtime across the season.

22:17.300 --> 22:20.767
- That's really nice. I really like this plan.
- Yeah.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.266
He likes it.

22:36.634 --> 22:39.734
- That's really nice. I really like this plan.
- Yeah.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.200
He likes it.

22:43.233 --> 22:44.500
So does Jeff.

22:45.900 --> 22:47.667
But
Iain Whyte's claim.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.734
Parker is decoding Iain's new,

22:49.767 --> 22:51.266
six foot super trommel.

22:52.367 --> 22:55.600
- Again, this is the primary path trail.
- Yeah.

22:58.166 --> 23:00.166
No, I don't wanna shut
your plant down.

23:08.233 --> 23:09.800
We shut her down,

23:09.834 --> 23:11.300
so we can take a look
in the primary.

23:13.233 --> 23:16.867
The primary catch tray is,
it's a small sluice run

23:16.900 --> 23:19.266
underneath the belly
of the trommel

23:19.300 --> 23:21.033
and Iain's catching around

23:21.066 --> 23:22.333
70 percent
of his gold in that.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.367
So, he does a quick cleanup
of that each day.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.300
- There's some gold in there.
- Yup.

23:29.800 --> 23:31.767
- Nice system, innit?
- Oh, yeah!

23:42.567 --> 23:43.800
Super easy cleanup.

23:44.233 --> 23:45.333
Oh, yeah.

23:46.266 --> 23:48.233
That is awesome, look at that.

23:49.667 --> 23:50.867
That is wicked.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.934
So quick!

23:54.967 --> 23:57.100
That was on, like, 15 minutes

23:57.133 --> 23:58.934
and we probably
slowed you down.

24:01.233 --> 24:04.433
Catch tray cleanups
on Iain's new Super Trommel

24:04.467 --> 24:08.000
can be performed by one person
in ten minutes,

24:08.033 --> 24:11.066
whereas cleanups on
Parker's Slucifer Plant

24:11.100 --> 24:14.300
can take at least three crew
members over an hour.

24:15.500 --> 24:18.600
What's, uh, what're your
thoughts here, like?

24:18.634 --> 24:20.033
It's going through
a hydraulic riffle,

24:20.066 --> 24:21.467
something you would
think about?

24:21.500 --> 24:24.567
Yeah, I think the only change
I'd want, is expand the metal.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.200
For his entire
mining career,

24:30.233 --> 24:33.533
Parker has preferred to use
long sluice runs

24:33.567 --> 24:36.066
with a combination
of Hungarian riffles

24:36.100 --> 24:37.900
and expanded metal

24:37.934 --> 24:40.266
giving him more areas
to catch gold.

24:41.967 --> 24:43.066
In contrast,

24:43.100 --> 24:45.734
the Kiwi miner's
secret to success

24:45.767 --> 24:49.700
is short sluice runs
with hydraulic riffles.

24:49.734 --> 24:52.500
These short little
runs that these guys
use are just,

24:52.533 --> 24:53.800
I'm not used to it.

24:53.834 --> 24:55.100
- They're very short.
- We usually have like,

24:55.133 --> 24:56.700
three different
types of riffles.

24:56.734 --> 24:59.400
I mean, you could
convert this one
to have a longer...

24:59.433 --> 25:01.533
- ...runs. And a lot of variation.
- Yeah.

25:01.567 --> 25:03.000
This could work
for you up north.

25:03.767 --> 25:05.433
Yeah.
It's a nice plan.

25:06.800 --> 25:07.600
Yeah, simple.

25:13.066 --> 25:15.567
I think we should
get out of here,
they're talking price here.

25:15.600 --> 25:17.600
- Is he asking him now?
- All right. Bye, bye.

25:19.867 --> 25:20.900
This trip
could be over.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.634
A nice setup.

25:23.667 --> 25:27.700
- That's definitely a very quick cleanup.
- Yeah.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.166
Would you change anything?

25:30.000 --> 25:30.800
Um...

25:44.934 --> 25:46.333
You wanna sell me your plant?

25:49.400 --> 25:51.266
So, Parker's
asking for a price.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.066
He's asking him
right now and I mean,

25:53.100 --> 25:55.033
in all honesty,
if the price is right

25:56.333 --> 25:58.367
and shipping was to work out,

25:58.400 --> 26:00.767
he could have this
plant for the beginning
of the season, no problem.

26:00.800 --> 26:02.834
What's something like that
worth, Jeff?

26:02.867 --> 26:06.433
- I've gotta say it's probably around six, seven.
- Right.

26:07.400 --> 26:09.600
At $700,000,

26:09.634 --> 26:12.934
it would be within Parker's
$1,000,000 budget.

26:12.967 --> 26:14.533
So, I guess

26:14.567 --> 26:16.467
it's all gonna
come down to uh--

26:16.500 --> 26:17.800
Yeah, the big dollar!

26:19.066 --> 26:19.967
All right.

26:22.433 --> 26:23.266
What do you reckon?

26:23.700 --> 26:25.634
Um...

26:25.667 --> 26:29.734
I mean, he had that twinkle
in his eye when I asked him
if he'd sell it.

26:29.767 --> 26:30.734
Of like...

26:32.367 --> 26:33.433
probably could.

26:34.100 --> 26:34.934
But...

26:36.133 --> 26:37.467
it's his baby.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.033
- And it's pretty new.
- Like, he's just not gonna do it.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.900
We started talking money
a little bit,

26:41.934 --> 26:45.300
but by the time I pry it
out of his hands,

26:45.333 --> 26:47.367
cut it up and get it
in containers,

26:47.400 --> 26:49.400
ship it to Burbank's

26:49.433 --> 26:50.634
and put it back together,

26:51.800 --> 26:54.033
a million dollars would be
long, long gone.

26:54.533 --> 26:55.333
Yeah.

26:56.767 --> 26:59.600
This sets a very high standard
for what we're looking for.

27:00.367 --> 27:01.467
I like those words.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.900
I like those words.

27:03.934 --> 27:05.266
The pressure's on,
but I like 'em.

27:06.667 --> 27:10.600
Well, thank you for showing
us around and sharing all your

27:10.634 --> 27:12.634
tricks and wisdom.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.567
- Really appreciated.
- Thanks, buddy.

27:29.033 --> 27:30.634
That new trommel
that he's got

27:32.100 --> 27:34.166
is very close to perfect.

27:34.200 --> 27:35.233
I wish he would've sold it.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.800
But Iain obviously
runs a very good mine site,

27:38.834 --> 27:41.100
that is super well-organized

27:41.133 --> 27:44.934
and I'm coming away from here
with a lot of good ideas.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.400
I thought you were
gonna buy a wash plant
at one point.

27:58.433 --> 27:59.300
Yeah, so did I!

27:59.333 --> 28:01.066
True.
For a minute there.

28:01.100 --> 28:03.200
Would've been nice
to have gotten it.

28:03.233 --> 28:04.867
- An early win.
- Mmm.

28:05.133 --> 28:06.700
Yeah.

28:06.734 --> 28:08.400
You know how quiet
that thing was?

28:08.433 --> 28:10.066
- So quiet.
- It was very quiet.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.467
I mean, since he
wouldn't sell that thing,

28:12.500 --> 28:14.634
it makes me think, okay,
what we could change.

28:14.667 --> 28:16.166
- Mmm-hmm.
- The only major thing is,

28:16.200 --> 28:18.200
hydraulics, they're
super finicky.

28:18.233 --> 28:20.000
I do like having longer
sluice runs

28:20.033 --> 28:22.467
that have a bunch of different
variations in them.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.266
With a few little changes,
that plant would have been

28:25.800 --> 28:27.300
super usable for us.

28:27.333 --> 28:28.533
- Good.
- It was a very nice trommel.

28:28.567 --> 28:31.233
We have to go see someone
who actually has a wash plant

28:31.266 --> 28:33.066
for sale tomorrow
which is really exciting.

28:33.100 --> 28:35.734
- Let's call it a night. I'm shattered.
- Bed.

28:35.767 --> 28:37.433
- Yeah.
- Night, guys.

28:37.467 --> 28:38.400
Nighty night.

28:58.266 --> 29:00.266
- This is beautiful.
- It is. It's gorgeous.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.734
Oh, my

29:02.767 --> 29:03.700
Look at that.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.900
After striking out
at Iain Whyte's claim,

29:09.934 --> 29:13.734
Parker's search
for the perfect
wash plant continues.

29:13.767 --> 29:16.066
I did really like
that trommel at Iain's.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.066
It's good, though.

29:17.100 --> 29:19.033
Good feeling
for moving forwards.

29:19.066 --> 29:20.567
- Mmm.
- Right?

29:20.600 --> 29:22.734
Yeah, we are in
the right spot, on the trail.

29:22.767 --> 29:24.634
So, we're going
to see a guy called
Ben Ferguson.

29:24.667 --> 29:25.900
Who's that?

29:25.934 --> 29:27.967
He's a local miner and farmer

29:28.000 --> 29:30.333
and he's got
a wash plant for sale.

29:30.367 --> 29:33.300
Parker and his team
travel 62 miles north

29:33.333 --> 29:35.533
to Ben Ferguson's farm

29:35.567 --> 29:38.533
in the heart of New Zealand's
agricultural district

29:39.066 --> 29:40.467
to tour a flat.

29:40.500 --> 29:43.767
- What kind of plant?
- Um, I don't actually know a lot about it.

29:43.800 --> 29:45.367
But, you wanted to see
the wash plants

29:45.400 --> 29:46.367
that were for sale
in the area.

29:46.400 --> 29:49.166
We are on the west coast,
this one's for sale.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.800
So, I thought
while we're in the area

29:50.834 --> 29:52.567
we might as well
pop by and see it.

29:58.033 --> 29:59.333
- Ben.
- Hi, guys.

29:59.367 --> 30:00.467
Hello, mate. How are you?

30:00.500 --> 30:01.867
- How you doing?
- I'm good, buddy.

30:01.900 --> 30:03.834
- It's all right. Here we go. How you do?
- Good, good to see you.

30:03.867 --> 30:04.867
Nice to meet you, Ben.
It's Jeff.

30:04.900 --> 30:06.367
- Hi, Jeff. How are you?
- Hi, Ben.

30:06.400 --> 30:08.266
- How are you doing, mate?
- Oh, I've been good. I've been good.

30:08.300 --> 30:09.700
- You guys?
- Good.

30:09.734 --> 30:12.934
- Hi, lovely.
- Who's that? Are you shy? You wanna say hello?

30:18.066 --> 30:21.166
Ben Ferguson is a sheep
and cattle farmer

30:21.200 --> 30:25.433
who prospects his 415 acres
of land for gold

30:25.467 --> 30:27.000
on his days off.

30:27.033 --> 30:28.333
Hear you got
a wash plant for sale, eh?

30:28.367 --> 30:30.734
Everything's for sale for the right price, so.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.700
So, this is the gold screen.

30:35.367 --> 30:38.600
So, this actually
was a cross section plant

30:38.634 --> 30:41.667
but I'm gonna get something
that can wash gravel
and might as well

30:41.700 --> 30:43.266
- do the whole lot, you know?
- Yeah.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.300
All those tables,
they just fold up.

30:45.333 --> 30:46.800
- There's hand winches.
- Gotcha.

30:49.133 --> 30:51.333
Ben's
15-year-old plant

30:51.367 --> 30:55.233
chugs through 30 yards
of gold rich pay an hour.

30:55.266 --> 30:58.333
Its fold-up sluices make
it quick to move.

30:58.367 --> 31:00.100
At $50,000,

31:00.133 --> 31:03.100
it's way under Parker's
$1,000,000 budget.

31:04.767 --> 31:09.834
I'm guessing we're not
buying this.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.800
- Why would say that?
- Um, just a hunch.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.533
I mean, we're here.
We may as well see it run.

31:18.567 --> 31:20.033
We could go
resurrect that thing.

31:23.467 --> 31:25.233
I'll go get some tools.

31:25.266 --> 31:27.533
You get started?

31:27.567 --> 31:30.066
- Do you like that truck? It's for sale, too.
- I like that, yeah.

31:30.100 --> 31:32.066
- Is it?
- Yeah, you can... Two for one.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.266
Yeah, why not?

31:35.333 --> 31:36.333
Okay, coming down.

31:44.567 --> 31:46.500
Yeah, she'd be good.
Some water.

31:47.133 --> 31:47.967
What do you think?

31:48.900 --> 31:50.200
- Yeah, some water, eh?
- See what happens.

31:53.333 --> 31:54.333
Moment of truth.

31:57.033 --> 31:58.033
Here she comes.

32:10.367 --> 32:11.900
- Yeah! Hah!
- Holy

32:11.934 --> 32:14.033
- We got a hole.
- Yeah, it's just a little one.

32:14.066 --> 32:15.467
Shut her down.

32:15.500 --> 32:16.567
There's a couple of holes.

32:18.100 --> 32:19.934
Holy moly.

32:19.967 --> 32:21.834
- There is leakage.
- Leaking everywhere.

32:26.567 --> 32:28.166
Um, gaffer tape?

32:31.867 --> 32:33.800
I mean, even if you got
this for free,

32:33.834 --> 32:36.700
you'd have to get it
to Alaska.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.967
I mean, not to
on someone's wash plant,

32:40.000 --> 32:42.066
but it's just not what
we're looking for.

32:45.500 --> 32:48.233
Jeff, so...

32:48.266 --> 32:51.767
I mean, is there anything that
you can see for us to
not waste our time?

32:52.567 --> 32:54.467
Why don't we see
if we can, uh,

32:54.500 --> 32:55.700
do a bit of a riffle test?

32:57.100 --> 33:00.166
We can disconnect
one of the hydraulic riffles
on one of the sides

33:00.200 --> 33:02.200
and run one side
with hydraulics
and the other side

33:02.233 --> 33:04.433
with Hungarian
and maybe we can
prove to Parker that

33:04.467 --> 33:05.967
hydraulic riffles
work a lot better.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.333
That's a great idea.

33:07.367 --> 33:10.033
There's been a lot of chat
about yay or nay
to hydraulic riffles.

33:10.066 --> 33:13.300
Yeah, he's not convinced,
but if I can sell him on this,
then I can sell him on

33:13.333 --> 33:14.333
hydraulic riffles.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.066
That would be,
uh, pretty cool.

33:16.100 --> 33:19.667
Mate, let's, um I think
we should put that up the...

33:20.900 --> 33:21.734
up the, what's the word?

33:21.767 --> 33:22.867
The what up there?

33:22.900 --> 33:24.734
You know when you put the idea
up there to the boss.

33:24.767 --> 33:25.734
Oh, um...

33:28.166 --> 33:31.533
What is that?
I'm just trying to think
of that, too.

33:31.567 --> 33:32.800
Let's put it to the boss.

33:36.433 --> 33:38.166
So...

33:38.200 --> 33:40.000
feel like if this is gonna be
a waste of a day or not?

33:41.667 --> 33:44.767
Well, to make it not
a complete waste of the day,

33:44.800 --> 33:46.367
- Parker...
- Mmm-hmm.

33:46.400 --> 33:48.934
what about we do a bit
of a test

33:50.066 --> 33:52.333
and we run one side
with hydraulics and one side,

33:52.367 --> 33:54.800
just the standard
Hungarian style

33:54.834 --> 33:57.166
to prove that
hydraulic riffles
work a lot better?

33:59.934 --> 34:00.934
That's not a bad idea.

34:02.734 --> 34:06.967
Jeff's plan.
Swap out one side
with hydraulic riffles

34:07.000 --> 34:09.600
and to do a test to see
which one is better.

34:12.266 --> 34:15.300
And this wash plant
is probably not worth

34:15.333 --> 34:18.100
shipping over to North America
from here.

34:18.133 --> 34:20.634
But, Jeff had a good idea,
it is worth

34:20.667 --> 34:22.300
testing out these
hydraulic riffles.

34:22.333 --> 34:23.867
For me, they've always been
a bit finicky.

34:23.900 --> 34:28.500
They plug up, but everybody in
New Zealand's using them
and so,

34:28.533 --> 34:30.767
it's a kind of a good chance
for us to

34:31.500 --> 34:34.667
just try 'em out.

34:34.700 --> 34:36.667
Did you find some lead shot
or something?

34:36.700 --> 34:37.900
- Lead shot?
- Yeah.

34:37.934 --> 34:39.533
So, Ben, we were
just wondering,

34:39.567 --> 34:43.000
I'm guessing that your plant
might not be like,
mega gold rich.

34:43.033 --> 34:44.533
- No.
- Jeff was just suggesting,

34:44.567 --> 34:47.867
- maybe if we could get some lead shot?
- Yeah.

34:47.900 --> 34:50.133
- to run through it, so we run a bit of a test.
- Sure.

34:50.166 --> 34:52.266
- Is that cool?
- That's good, man. Yeah, I could get some.

34:52.300 --> 34:54.033
This is something
that we do quite often

34:54.066 --> 34:55.467
to try and test plants.

34:55.500 --> 34:57.133
And we do choose lead pallets.

34:57.166 --> 35:01.467
Lead is cheap
and significantly heavier
than black sand and gravel

35:01.500 --> 35:04.200
making it the ideal substitute
for gold

35:04.233 --> 35:05.634
when running tests.

35:05.667 --> 35:08.233
- Any ideas where we'd get it from?
- Uh...

35:08.266 --> 35:10.200
hardware store
or anything like that.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.467
- We could go get the lead pallets.
- Okay.

35:12.500 --> 35:15.467
So, should we put like
a wager on which side's
gonna work better?

35:15.500 --> 35:17.467
You have that side.
I'm gonna be on this side.

35:18.367 --> 35:20.667
My bet that we get

35:20.700 --> 35:24.600
the lead shot in,
within these first
two riffles on this side.

35:24.634 --> 35:28.066
The winner will be
determined by who
has the most lead

35:28.100 --> 35:29.700
at the top of the sluice box.

35:31.767 --> 35:33.333
- So, you gonna fix this hose?
- Yeah.

35:33.367 --> 35:34.166
Ahh!

35:38.200 --> 35:39.467
It is coming
down now.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.700
Yeah, it is.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.600
Danny and Tyler
arrive in Reefton

35:50.634 --> 35:53.500
in search of lead shot
for the riffles test.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.667
What the

35:59.700 --> 36:00.734
What the is that!

36:02.400 --> 36:03.867
It's a flood or something?

36:03.900 --> 36:04.700
Earthquake?

36:15.066 --> 36:16.133
- Hello!
- Hi, guys.

36:16.166 --> 36:17.233
We're a little bit
worried about

36:17.266 --> 36:19.500
the air raid sirens going off.

36:19.533 --> 36:21.467
No,
that's not an air raid,
that's a fire alarm.

36:21.500 --> 36:24.266
- Bit eerie, isn't it?
- It is, it is quite an eerie sound.

36:24.300 --> 36:25.800
You're probably gonna
be able to help us,

36:25.834 --> 36:30.100
I'm after some,
like, lead pellets
or something like that.

36:30.133 --> 36:32.867
Sure, I think we might have
something out--

36:32.900 --> 36:35.700
So, you got a couple
of bits of people to go out
prospecting and--

36:35.734 --> 36:37.200
Yes, yes we have.

36:37.233 --> 36:38.433
Look at that!

36:38.467 --> 36:40.433
- Dan, that'll work perfect.
- Boom!

36:40.467 --> 36:42.066
- I'm happy with that.
- Winner!

36:42.100 --> 36:43.700
- Oh, wow! Should we get a coffee?
- Yeah.

36:43.734 --> 36:44.533
Coffee it is.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.133
At part time
gold miner,

36:56.166 --> 36:57.934
Ben Ferguson's farm,

36:57.967 --> 36:59.600
Jeff is setting up
a comparison

36:59.634 --> 37:03.634
test between hydraulic
and Hungarian riffles.

37:03.667 --> 37:06.900
Maybe we can prove
to Parker that hydraulic
riffles work a lot better.

37:06.934 --> 37:09.834
If I can sell him on this,
then I can sell him on
hydraulic riffles.

37:12.266 --> 37:13.333
Oh, look at that!

37:13.367 --> 37:14.166
That's good.

37:16.133 --> 37:17.333
Oh they don't look too wet.

37:17.367 --> 37:20.266
- Okay.
- Oh, no, Jeff does look wet, look he's drenched.

37:20.300 --> 37:21.967
He's drenched.

37:22.700 --> 37:23.767
Did you find something?

37:23.800 --> 37:25.367
- We managed just.
- Mate, did we?

37:25.400 --> 37:26.767
- You wanna check it out?
- Yeah.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.400
- Wow!
- You got a milk container.

37:28.433 --> 37:30.834
With lead shot!

37:30.867 --> 37:33.133
So, can we pound some
of this out 'cause

37:33.166 --> 37:34.400
it's a lot of round gold.

37:34.433 --> 37:35.467
Why do we need to pound it?

37:35.500 --> 37:37.500
- 'Cause gold's not round, Dan.
- Gold's not round.

37:38.667 --> 37:40.834
Parker, I'll let you count
them out.

37:40.867 --> 37:42.467
I'm gonna do
groups of five.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.266
I bet you we'd dig
some lead up

37:44.300 --> 37:45.600
out of the ground, too.

37:45.634 --> 37:47.333
Is that
the old timers?

37:47.367 --> 37:49.033
So, what used to happen,

37:49.066 --> 37:50.867
the old fellas away
for a flood

37:50.900 --> 37:51.967
and then, they'd get
the lead shot

37:52.000 --> 37:54.367
and they'd literally
toss it in the river.

37:54.400 --> 37:57.266
And then they go pan,
once the water go down

37:57.300 --> 38:00.066
pan it into a river bag
until they found
the lead shot.

38:00.100 --> 38:02.667
When the found the lead shot,
that's obviously where
the flood goes

38:02.700 --> 38:03.634
and they start digging down.

38:03.667 --> 38:04.967
- Ahh!
- No way!

38:05.000 --> 38:07.433
Yeah, I have not
mined anywhere,
I have not found lead.

38:08.533 --> 38:11.266
Here, Tyler.
You can keep these.

38:11.300 --> 38:12.266
That's what
we're gonna use.

38:13.367 --> 38:14.867
So, what's the plan, team?

38:14.900 --> 38:16.500
So, the test
that we're doing,

38:16.533 --> 38:20.500
on the right hand side of
the sluice run, we're gonna be
running Hungarian riffles

38:20.533 --> 38:23.567
and on the left hand side,
we're gonna be running
the hydraulic riffles.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.400
We're gonna
put some on one side
and some on the other?

38:26.433 --> 38:27.433
Yeah, exactly.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.000
More sluice in.

38:41.700 --> 38:43.433
How many pieces have
you got each?

38:43.467 --> 38:45.834
- I have 20.
- I've got 20.

38:45.867 --> 38:47.600
- Okay.
- Let's go.

38:50.200 --> 38:51.033
Do it!

38:59.867 --> 39:01.900
So now, he's gonna run
for a little while

39:01.934 --> 39:03.500
and make sure
they stay in there.

39:03.533 --> 39:05.333
Giving a chance for the lad
to sink down

39:05.367 --> 39:07.600
and see how far down
it makes it down each side.

39:10.567 --> 39:12.900
I'm hoping that
the hydraulic riffles,

39:12.934 --> 39:15.700
the lead shot makes it into
the first or second riffle.

39:15.734 --> 39:18.667
And on this side,
it travels down
a little bit further.

39:22.133 --> 39:24.934
After ten minutes,
the crew shut down.

39:26.100 --> 39:27.767
Cleanup time!

39:27.800 --> 39:30.166
The crew pan
each riffle separately

39:30.200 --> 39:34.166
to determine exactly where
each piece of lead was caught.

39:34.200 --> 39:37.834
- Anything, Jeff?
- Yeah, I got, I got two.

39:37.867 --> 39:38.800
Gonna put 'em over here.

39:39.734 --> 39:40.800
I've got four.

39:41.400 --> 39:42.266
Any more, Ty?

39:43.367 --> 39:45.066
Not quite yet.

39:45.100 --> 39:48.734
If Jeff can prove
that Kiwi-preferred
hydraulic riffles are better,

39:48.767 --> 39:53.500
it'll open up more options
for potential plants
for Parker.

39:53.533 --> 39:56.100
So, Jeff,
you've got the last pan, mate.

39:56.133 --> 39:58.634
Yeah, these came out
of the fourth riffle here.

39:58.667 --> 40:00.634
So, this one loses,
doesn't it?

40:00.667 --> 40:02.467
'Cause they all come
too far down.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.166
Well, it caught them all, but,

40:04.200 --> 40:07.266
the hydraulic riffles side
caught 'em within
the first four.

40:07.300 --> 40:08.333
I'm gonna call this a win.

40:09.800 --> 40:13.400
So, does this prove
Jeff's theory on hydraulics
are better?

40:13.433 --> 40:14.734
Seems to.

40:14.767 --> 40:18.000
I think that was
a hard proud out
yes there, I think.

40:18.033 --> 40:20.634
They're just finicky, you know?

40:20.667 --> 40:23.166
Keeping 'em clean, you're just
like, every time you do a big cleanup,

40:23.200 --> 40:25.934
you tip 'em all upside down.
It's like an oil change,
you just gotta...

40:25.967 --> 40:27.367
- do it, yeah.
- Just gotta do it.

40:28.867 --> 40:30.266
Being able to do
a hydraulic

40:30.300 --> 40:32.800
versus Hungarian riffle test,

40:32.834 --> 40:34.266
turned out awesome

40:34.300 --> 40:38.500
and I'm feeling pretty
confident that Parker's
on board a little bit.

40:38.533 --> 40:40.600
I'm used to running big
sluice boxes that have

40:40.634 --> 40:42.233
a bunch of variations in them,

40:42.266 --> 40:44.300
but if you can recover
the same amount of gold

40:44.333 --> 40:47.467
in a shorter sluice box
or a narrower sluice box then,

40:47.500 --> 40:49.967
it's worth looking
into hydraulic riffles, right?

40:50.834 --> 40:54.200
So, um, I don't quite
think that we'll

40:54.233 --> 40:57.300
be interested in buying
and shipping this to Alaska.

40:57.333 --> 40:58.934
Couldn't imagine why,
but sure.

41:00.700 --> 41:02.634
Thanks for having
us though, Ben.
This has been good.

41:02.667 --> 41:03.467
That's all right, guys.

41:05.867 --> 41:08.233
I, of course,
am not interested
in that wash plant, like,

41:08.266 --> 41:11.500
not only is it old and small,
but you just can't

41:12.333 --> 41:14.967
move something like that
to Alaska.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.900
I'm just happy
that we're still

41:16.934 --> 41:21.500
getting access and people
are being super friendly
and open and um,

41:21.533 --> 41:23.100
and having those
conversations with us.

41:23.133 --> 41:25.667
So, yeah, overall,
it's a win still.

41:29.400 --> 41:30.600
On to the next place.

41:31.600 --> 41:32.800
- Yup.
- On to the next.
