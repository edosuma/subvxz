WEBVTT

00:07.170 --> 00:10.299
>>> HONESTLY, I'M MORE
INTERESTED IN PRODUCTS LIKE

00:10.300 --> 00:13.529
AMBIEN THAT ENCOURAGE ME TO STAY
ASLEEP, AND SEND THE OCCASIONAL

00:13.530 --> 00:21.999
RACIST TWEET.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.769
ARE THE HOLLYWOOD LIBERAL ELITE
REALLY THAT LIBERAL OR ARE THEY

00:27.770 --> 00:33.699
JUST A BUNCH OF HYPOCRITES THAT
DIDN'T REMEMBER TO NOMINATE ME?

00:33.700 --> 00:37.099
AND I HAVE A POLICE RIDE ALONG
COMING UP IN AMSTERDAM.

00:37.100 --> 00:59.229
LET'S GET STARTED.

00:59.230 --> 01:01.169
>>> GOOD EEJS, WELCOME TO THE

01:01.170 --> 01:05.699
JIM JEFFRIES SHOW, I'M JEFF

01:05.700 --> 01:06.330
JEFFRIES, WE'RE BACK.

01:06.331 --> 01:08.329
NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON.

01:08.330 --> 01:16.969
LAST WEEK, NIKE UNVEILED A NEW
JUST DO IT CAMPAIGN.

01:16.970 --> 01:21.829
>> BELIEVE IN SOMETHING, EVEN IF
IT MEANS SACRIFICING EVERYTHING.

01:21.830 --> 01:26.168
>> DON'T ASK IF YOUR DREAMS ARE
CRAZY, ASK IF THEY'RE CRAZY ENOUGH.

01:26.171 --> 01:32.197
>> IT'S AMAZING THEY'RE USING A SPOKESPERSON
THAT ISN'T EVEN PLAYING HIS SPORT.

01:32.200 --> 01:35.029
I IMAGINE IF NIKE BRINGS OUT A

01:35.030 --> 01:39.199
SHOE FOR COLIN KAEPERNICK, IT'S

01:39.200 --> 01:44.799
GOT TO BE A SHOE WITH NO LACES.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.929
EVERY TIME HE BENDS DOWN TO DO

01:46.930 --> 01:51.729
HIS SHOES, PEOPLE GET THEIR

01:51.730 --> 01:53.399
CAMERAS OUT, HE'S PROTESTING.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.069
NO, NO, NO.

01:55.070 --> 01:59.729
I'M JUST DOING MY SHOES UP.

01:59.730 --> 02:02.430
THE CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN A HUGE
SUCCESS.

02:02.431 --> 02:07.228
SINCE KAEPERNICK BECAME THE NEW FACE
OF NIKE, SALES HAVE INCREASED 31%.

02:07.231 --> 02:11.000
THANK YOU, NIKE, FOR STANDING UP
FOR KNEELING.

02:11.001 --> 02:14.568
EVEN THOUGH MOST OF YOUR POLITICAL
DONATIONS ARE TO REPUBLICANS.

02:14.571 --> 02:17.399
AND YOU JUST SIGNED AN
EIGHT-YEAR DEAL WITH THE SAME

02:17.400 --> 02:21.169
LEAGUE THAT REFUSES TO LET
KAEPERNICK PLAY.

02:21.170 --> 02:24.999
NIKE IS KNEELING SO MUCH FOR THE

02:25.000 --> 02:26.229
NFL, THEY'RE CHANGING THEIR

02:26.230 --> 02:28.929
SLOGAN TO JUST DO IT, BUT MAKE

02:28.930 --> 02:31.400
IT QUICK AND DON'T GET IT IN MY
HAIR.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.799
WHAT DID I SAY?

02:34.800 --> 02:36.099
>> PEOPLE ARE SMART.

02:36.100 --> 02:39.469
WHO COULD BE DUPED INTO THE
COMPANY THAT ALSO HAPPENS TO

02:39.470 --> 02:46.329
HAVE A WELL KNOWN HISTORY OF
LABOR ABUSES.

02:46.330 --> 02:47.000
>> FROM FREEDOM FRIENDLY NIKE.

02:47.000 --> 02:47.830
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

02:47.831 --> 02:56.427
AS A SALUTE TO COLIN KAEPERNICK, TO NIKE,
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR FANTASTIC SIGNING.

02:56.430 --> 02:58.799
>> ALL THESE YEARS LATER, AND

02:58.800 --> 03:03.169
JIM CARREY IS STILL TALKING OUT
OF HIS ASS.

03:03.170 --> 03:04.499
NIKE IS A CORPORATION.

03:04.500 --> 03:08.229
AND CORPORATIONS DON'T HAVE
PROGRESSIVE VALUES.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.329
THEY HAVE SHAREHOLDERS.

03:10.330 --> 03:13.628
NIKE DIDN'T LETTER KAEPERNICK BECAUSE
SHE CARE ABOUT SOCIAL JUSTICE.

03:13.631 --> 03:16.599
THEY HIRED HIM BECAUSE YOU CAN.

03:16.600 --> 03:19.798
>> CORPORATIONS HAVE INTEREST, AND IF
THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD LOSE MONEY.

03:19.801 --> 03:26.568
IF THEY THOUGHT THEY WOULD MINIMIZE
SHAREHOLDER WEALTH, THEY WOULD DO THAT.

03:26.571 --> 03:33.098
PEOPLE ARE REALIZING THEY WANT
COMPANIES TO TAKE STRONG CHANCES.

03:33.101 --> 03:37.329
>> PEOPLE WANT COMPANIES TO BE
SOCIALLY AWARE.

03:37.330 --> 03:37.900
BEING WOKE.

03:37.900 --> 03:38.670
PEOPLE MIGHT SAY.

03:38.671 --> 03:47.597
I WOULDN'T SAY IT, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SOUND
RIGHT COMING OUT OF A WHITE AUSTRALIAN'S MOUTH.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.169
WOKE, ON FLEEK, I SHOULDN'T BE

03:50.170 --> 03:54.370
ALLOWED TO SAY ANY
OF THOSE THINGS.

03:54.371 --> 03:59.469
ACTUALLY, I DO LIKE SAYING
TURD'S UP.

03:59.470 --> 04:04.069
I'M GOING TO TRY TO USE IT IN
SENTENCES THIS WEEK.

04:04.070 --> 04:07.499
THIS YEAR'S ADS OPERATE A

04:07.500 --> 04:08.899
PRETEND WOKENESS, INCLUDING THE

04:08.900 --> 04:10.569
ONE WHERE A MARTIN LUTHER KING

04:10.570 --> 04:15.729
SPEECH WAS USED TO SELL CARS.

04:15.730 --> 04:19.369
>> THE THERMO
DYNAMICS IN PHYSICS.

04:19.370 --> 04:25.329
>> WE NEED A HEART FULL OF GRACE.

04:25.330 --> 04:30.329
SO GENERATED BY LOVE.

04:30.330 --> 04:33.369
>> WHAT WAS THAT.

04:33.370 --> 04:38.329
THAT IS PRETTY INSENSETIVE,
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER

04:38.330 --> 04:42.599
TRACKS OF THE SECOND MOST RACIST
KIND OF CAR.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.669
THE LIST GOES DODGE CHARGERS,

04:44.670 --> 04:48.029
TRUCKS AND HERBIE THE LOVE BUG.

04:48.030 --> 04:50.329
SURE IT SOUNDED LIKE HERBIE WAS

04:50.330 --> 04:54.329
TALKING TO US WITH HIS HORN, BUT

04:54.330 --> 04:56.669
THAT WAS THE CENSORS BLEEPING

04:56.670 --> 04:57.230
OVER THE BAD WORDS.

04:57.231 --> 04:59.869
NO, HERBIE, NO.

04:59.870 --> 05:02.829
IF COLIN KAEPERNICK SELLS SHOES,

05:02.830 --> 05:05.629
THAT'S NOT NIKE TAKING A MORAL

05:05.630 --> 05:07.469
STAND IT'S JUST GOOD MARKETING

05:07.470 --> 05:08.899
MANY TO THE PEOPLE BURNING THEIR

05:08.900 --> 05:09.929
SHOES IN OUTRAGE.

05:09.930 --> 05:12.069
YOU'RE NOT MAD AT NIKE, YOU'RE

05:12.070 --> 05:14.929
MAD BECAUSE YOU LIVE IN A WORLD

05:14.930 --> 05:17.369
WHERE COLIN KAEPERNICK IS

05:17.370 --> 05:18.769
POPULAR AND RESPECTED.

05:18.770 --> 05:20.329
DESTROYING THE SHOES YOU ALREADY

05:20.330 --> 05:22.099
PURCHASED DOESN'T AFFECT NIKE

05:22.100 --> 05:24.329
SALES ONE BIT.

05:24.330 --> 05:28.329
IF YOU WANT TO GET THEM WHERE IT

05:28.330 --> 05:31.329
HURTS, GET THEM IN THE SHORTS,

05:31.330 --> 05:33.969
BURN DOWN A NIKE FACTORY.

05:33.970 --> 05:35.669
OR BURN DOWN AN INDONESIAN CHILD

05:35.670 --> 05:38.329
THAT MAKES THE SNEAKERS.

05:38.330 --> 05:41.369
OR BURN DOWN THE GRASS THAT THE

05:41.370 --> 05:41.900
COWS EAT, BURN IT.

05:41.901 --> 05:44.699
BURN IT ALL.

05:44.700 --> 05:45.030
SORRY.

05:45.031 --> 05:49.499
SORRY.

05:49.500 --> 05:53.329
LET'S NOT BURN ANYTHING.

05:53.330 --> 05:58.329
I GOT A BIG TURD'S UP THERE.

05:58.330 --> 06:01.130
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

06:03.000 --> 06:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:10.630 --> 06:12.399
>>> WELCOME BACK.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.169
THE EMMYS WERE LAST NIGHT, YOU

06:14.170 --> 06:17.499
MIGHT NOTICE I SEEM A LITTLE

06:17.500 --> 06:18.000
HUNGOVER TODAY.

06:18.000 --> 06:18.770
THAT'S FROM DRINKING AT HOME AND

06:18.770 --> 06:19.470
YELLING AT MY TV, BECAUSE I

06:19.471 --> 06:25.129
WASN'T INSWRITED.

06:25.130 --> 06:26.429
OF COURSE IT WOULDN'T BE THE

06:26.430 --> 06:28.199
EMMYS WITHOUT THE ANNUAL

06:28.200 --> 06:29.499
TRADITION OF CONSERVATIVE

06:29.500 --> 06:31.399
ANCHORS MAKING FUN OF

06:31.400 --> 06:31.830
CELEBRITIES.

06:31.831 --> 06:35.069
>> THE EMMYS, LIVING UP TO THE

06:35.070 --> 06:36.129
HYPE, WASTING NO TIME GETTING

06:36.130 --> 06:36.530
POLITICAL.

06:36.531 --> 06:38.599
>> MORE INSANITY COMING FROM THE

06:38.600 --> 06:39.799
LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD ELITE.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.399
>> THE HOLLYWOOD ELITE.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.129
>> THE HOLLYWOOD EYE HEATS ARE

06:44.130 --> 06:46.029
BEHIND MANY THEY'RE NOT

06:46.030 --> 06:46.930
CONNECTED TO THE AMERICAN

06:46.930 --> 06:47.330
PEOPLE.

06:47.331 --> 06:48.869
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOLLYWOOD

06:48.870 --> 06:53.469
AND HOW THE CULTURAL ELITE HAVE

06:53.470 --> 06:56.829
TBS -- TRUMP DERANGEMENT

06:56.830 --> 06:57.230
SYNDROME.

06:57.231 --> 07:01.699
>> SURE, HOLLYWOOD IS ALL ELITE

07:01.700 --> 07:03.329
UNLIKE FOX NEWS.

07:03.330 --> 07:05.099
DID YOU KNOW EVERY DAY WHEN

07:05.100 --> 07:06.499
STEVE RIDES HIS HORSE TO WORK,

07:06.500 --> 07:09.499
HE STOPS BY THE COAL MINE RIGHT

07:09.500 --> 07:13.499
NEXT TO THE CHRYSLER BUILDING TO

07:13.500 --> 07:17.499
GET IN A FEW HOURS OF DIGGING

07:17.500 --> 07:20.469
BEFORE GOING TO THE FISH SHACK

07:20.470 --> 07:21.400
CALLED NOBU.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.170
IT'S SO POOR THAT RESTAURANT

07:22.171 --> 07:25.729
THEY HAVE TO EAT WITH WOODEN

07:25.730 --> 07:26.200
STICKS.

07:26.201 --> 07:27.729
THE ELITE ARE A SMALL PERCENTAGE

07:27.730 --> 07:29.329
OF PEOPLE WORKING IN HOLLYWOOD.

07:29.330 --> 07:30.899
MOST PEOPLE ARE JUST TRYING TO

07:30.900 --> 07:32.669
FIND THEIR NEXT GIG AND PAY THE

07:32.670 --> 07:33.030
BILLS.

07:33.031 --> 07:35.199
WHEN AN ACTOR FINDS WORK DOING A

07:35.200 --> 07:35.970
REGULAR JOB.

07:35.971 --> 07:37.199
SUDDENLY EVERYONE'S SHOCKED.

07:37.200 --> 07:39.829
>> 26 YEARS AFTER THE COSBY SHOW

07:39.830 --> 07:41.469
WENT OFF THE AIR.

07:41.470 --> 07:43.029
JEFFREY OWENS IS GOING VIRAL.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.469
ALL BECAUSE A WOMAN SHOPPING AT

07:45.470 --> 07:48.399
TRADER JOE'S, SNAPPED PHOTOS OF

07:48.400 --> 07:49.429
HIM WORKING THE A NEW JERSEY

07:49.430 --> 07:50.100
GROCERY STORE.

07:50.101 --> 07:53.469
>> IN ALL FAIRNESS, THAT MAKES

07:53.470 --> 07:54.230
HIM A MEMBER OF THE NEW JERSEY

07:54.230 --> 07:54.800
ELITE.

07:54.800 --> 07:55.700
>> WHAT'S THE PROBLEM.

07:55.701 --> 07:59.769
HE'S AN ACTOR WHO FOUND A WAY TO

07:59.770 --> 08:01.229
MAKE ENDS MEET BETWEEN GIGS.

08:01.230 --> 08:06.469
FRANKLY, THAT HEADLINE SHOULD

08:06.470 --> 08:07.529
READ, COSBY SHOW ACTOR SPOTTED

08:07.530 --> 08:08.630
NOT RAPING.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.729
>> YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER, THERE'S

08:13.730 --> 08:14.969
MORE THAN ONE HOLGLY WOOD.

08:14.970 --> 08:17.529
THERE'S THE PEOPLE OF HOLLYWOOD

08:17.530 --> 08:20.329
ANDY MANY OF THEM ARE LIBERALS.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.229
THERE'S ALSO HOLLYWOOD THE

08:22.230 --> 08:24.399
INDUSTRY, WHICH ISN'T A LIBERAL

08:24.400 --> 08:24.800
PARADISE.

08:24.801 --> 08:26.499
HOLLYWOOD IS A MULTIBILLION

08:26.500 --> 08:27.000
DOLLAR BUSINESS.

08:27.001 --> 08:28.599
THAT MEANS IT'S MOSTLY WHITE MEN

08:28.600 --> 08:30.329
IN SUITS, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

08:30.330 --> 08:32.029
HOW TO TURN MONEY INTO MORE

08:32.030 --> 08:32.370
MONEY.

08:32.370 --> 08:33.330
>> WE'RE TALKING TO THE PEOPLE

08:33.331 --> 08:36.999
WHO MAKE UP THE EXECUTIVE SUITES

08:37.000 --> 08:38.969
THAT ARE 94% WHITE AND 100%

08:38.970 --> 08:41.328
MALE.

08:41.330 --> 08:44.469
>> FOR YEARS PEOPLE WOULD SAY,

08:44.470 --> 08:46.429
YES, DIVERSITY IS A GREAT THING.

08:46.430 --> 08:49.129
THEY THOUGHT OF IT AS A LUXURY.

08:49.130 --> 08:51.229
WHEN YOU START CONNECTING

08:51.230 --> 08:53.229
DIVERSITY TO THE BOTTOM LINE,

08:53.230 --> 08:56.069
SUDDENLY IT BECOMES AN

08:56.070 --> 08:56.700
IMPERATIVE

08:56.700 --> 08:57.130
IMPERATIVE.

08:57.130 --> 08:57.870
>> THAT'S LITERALLY PUTTING A

08:57.871 --> 09:01.229
PRICE ON PEOPLE OF COLOR.

09:01.230 --> 09:05.799
WHEN IN HISTORY HAVE WE DONE

09:05.800 --> 09:08.500
THAT?

09:09.400 --> 09:10.799
>> NOT THE MOST LIBERAL IDEA, IS

09:10.800 --> 09:11.100
IT?

09:11.101 --> 09:12.569
IT'S HOW HOLLYWOOD IS RUN.

09:12.570 --> 09:14.229
JUST TODAY, I HEARD TWO STUDIO

09:14.230 --> 09:16.129
EXECUTIVES TALKING ABOUT IT IN

09:16.130 --> 09:17.130
THE OFFICES NEXT DOOR.

09:17.131 --> 09:19.899
>> SAY, ROY, DID YOU HEAR, BROWN

09:19.900 --> 09:22.169
AND YELLOW PEOPLE ARE WORTH BIG

09:22.170 --> 09:23.229
BUCKS NOW.

09:23.230 --> 09:26.029
>> LIKE PANTHER AND ALL THOSE

09:26.030 --> 09:26.670
CRAZY RICH ASIANS.

09:26.671 --> 09:29.099
>> I WANTED JENNIFER LAWRENCE TO

09:29.100 --> 09:29.800
PLAY ALL THE ASIANS BUT THEY

09:29.801 --> 09:31.129
WOULDN'T LET ME.

09:31.130 --> 09:33.229
>> USED TO BE YOU'D THROW A

09:33.230 --> 09:35.329
WHITE GUY IN THERE, GIVE HIM A

09:35.330 --> 09:38.429
WIG AND A SWORD.

09:38.430 --> 09:40.469
IT'S AN ASIAN.

09:40.470 --> 09:41.799
>> NOT ANY MORE, NOW THEY GOT TO

09:41.800 --> 09:42.500
BE CRAZY AND THEY GOT TO BE

09:42.501 --> 09:48.129
REAL.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.699
>> THAT LAST TIME WAS THE TWO OF

09:50.700 --> 09:54.199
THEM 69ING.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.629
TO CALL HOLLYWOOD LIBERAL IS TO

09:56.630 --> 09:58.729
IGNORE THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH

09:58.730 --> 09:59.300
DIVERSITY.

09:59.301 --> 10:01.099
ONE REPORT FOUND THAT ASIANS

10:01.100 --> 10:02.469
REPRESENT LESS THAN ONE IN 20

10:02.470 --> 10:05.029
SPEAKING PARTS IN MAJOR FILMS,

10:05.030 --> 10:07.969
AND 78% OF MIDDLE EASTERN ROLES

10:07.970 --> 10:09.699
ARE SOME VERSION OF A SOLDIER OR

10:09.700 --> 10:11.029
A TRIFRT.

10:11.030 --> 10:12.469
JUST LAST NIGHT, ONLY A FEW

10:12.470 --> 10:14.769
AWARDS WENT TO PEOPLE OF COLOR.

10:14.770 --> 10:16.769
TO BE FAIR, PEOPLE OF COLOR

10:16.770 --> 10:18.569
SWEPT THE CREATIVE ARTS IN THE

10:18.570 --> 10:21.369
LAST WEEK, WHICH IS A SEPARATE

10:21.370 --> 10:23.599
BUT EQUAL AND UNTELEVISED.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.469
I WASN'T INVITED TO THAT EITHER.

10:25.470 --> 10:29.329
BURN IT DOWN.

10:29.330 --> 10:30.799
RANTING ABOUT HOLLYWOOD ELITES

10:30.800 --> 10:33.029
MAY GET THE CONSERVATIVE BASE

10:33.030 --> 10:34.869
RILED UP, IT'S NOT TRUE.

10:34.870 --> 10:38.429
THE INDUSTRY IS SORELY LACKING

10:38.430 --> 10:40.929
GENDER DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY.

10:40.930 --> 10:42.429
MOST PEOPLE ARE STRUGGLING TO

10:42.430 --> 10:43.829
MAKE ENDS MEET.

10:43.830 --> 10:45.099
BEFORE WE PAINT THE HOLLYWOOD

10:45.100 --> 10:47.369
PEOPLE WITH THE SAME BROADBRUSH.

10:47.370 --> 10:50.269
LET'S TAKE A MOMENT TO SEE WHO

10:50.270 --> 10:53.369
IS ACTUALLY ELITE.

10:53.370 --> 10:56.199
YOU HAVE YOUR GEORGES, YOUR

10:56.200 --> 10:58.499
MERYLS, YOUR TOMS, YOUR DENZELS.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.669
NO, HE'S ALLOWED TO ACT.

11:00.670 --> 11:05.469
STOP IT.

11:05.470 --> 11:05.900
I'M SORRY.

11:05.901 --> 11:09.969
WE DIDN'T NEED A CAR ON STAFF

11:09.970 --> 11:10.430
FOR DIVERSITY.

11:10.431 --> 11:13.469
THOSE ARE THE ELITE PEOPLE.

11:13.470 --> 11:16.969
THERE'S ALSO THE OUT OF WORK

11:16.970 --> 11:20.699
ACTOR AUDITIONING FOR A TACO

11:20.700 --> 11:21.470
BELL COMMERCIAL.

11:21.471 --> 11:23.999
HE HAS PLENTY OF FREE TIME.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.329
STILL, HE'S NOT AN ELITE.

11:25.330 --> 11:28.999
AND THEN YOU GOT THE MAN IN THE

11:29.000 --> 11:32.429
SPONGEBOB COSTUME GETTING

11:32.430 --> 11:33.330
ARRESTED.

11:33.331 --> 11:35.369
OFFICER, I TOLD YOU WHERE I

11:35.370 --> 11:35.770
LIVED.

11:35.771 --> 11:41.329
DO YOU WANT ME TO SING THE SONG

11:41.330 --> 11:41.670
AGAIN?

11:41.671 --> 11:47.469
* OH, 260 VINE STREET

11:47.470 --> 11:49.769
ANYWAY, SPONGEBOB NOT AN ELITE.

11:49.770 --> 11:52.829
AND HERE'S LES MOONVES.

11:52.830 --> 11:54.929
IN FRENCH THAT MEANS THE MOVIES.

11:54.930 --> 11:57.329
HE JUST GOT FIRED FROM CBS OVER

11:57.330 --> 11:58.869
ALLEGATIONS HE SEXUALLY HARASSED

11:58.870 --> 11:59.929
A LOT OF WOMEN.

11:59.930 --> 12:01.099
HE'LL BE JUST FINE.

12:01.100 --> 12:04.069
HE'S A 68-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH $700

12:04.070 --> 12:05.169
MILLION IN THE BANK.

12:05.170 --> 12:09.469
I'M SURE HE'LL MAKE RETIREMENT

12:09.470 --> 12:10.330
WORK.

12:10.330 --> 12:10.600
ELITE.

12:10.601 --> 12:12.729
SO REMEMBER, NOT ALL OF US IN

12:12.730 --> 12:13.929
HOLLYWOOD ARE RICH LIBERAL

12:13.930 --> 12:14.330
ELITES.

12:14.331 --> 12:16.499
THAT'S A STEREOTYPE, AND IT'S

12:16.500 --> 12:18.369
MUCH MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

12:18.370 --> 12:21.399
I DON'T EXPECT YOU INBREAD

12:21.400 --> 12:22.070
FLORIDA STATE RED NECKS TO

12:22.070 --> 12:22.530
UNDERSTAND.

12:22.531 --> 12:24.500
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

12:36.630 --> 12:37.500
>>> WELCOME BACK.

12:37.501 --> 12:39.129
NOW THAT MANY STATES HAVE

12:39.130 --> 12:40.499
LEGALIZED MARIJUANA.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.129
SOME PEOPLE WORRY THAT CRIME

12:42.130 --> 12:43.699
WILL GO THROUGH THE ROOF.

12:43.700 --> 12:45.599
SO TO TEST THAT THEORY, I RODE

12:45.600 --> 12:48.529
ALONG WITH SOME COPS WHO HAVE

12:48.530 --> 12:49.330
BEEN DEALING WITH LEGALIZED WEED

12:49.331 --> 12:50.769
FOR DECADES.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.229
IN THE LATEST INSTALLMENT OF

12:52.230 --> 12:53.729
JIM'S A COP.

12:53.730 --> 12:55.329
>> MY LAST POLICE RIDE YA LONG

12:55.330 --> 12:58.169
WAS IN BIRMINGHAM, ENGLAND.

12:58.170 --> 12:59.599
THINGS WERE LOW KEY, THEY DON'T

12:59.600 --> 13:01.029
EVEN CARRY GUNS.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.899
SURE, I HAD SOME LAUGHS, BUT I'M

13:02.900 --> 13:05.769
NOT DOING THIS BIT TO MAKE

13:05.770 --> 13:06.130
FRIENDS.

13:06.131 --> 13:11.799
I KNOW JUST WHERE TO FIND THE

13:11.800 --> 13:12.170
ACTION.

13:12.171 --> 13:13.729
>> HOW BAD COULD THINGS GET.

13:13.730 --> 13:16.469
>> DRUNKEN BRAWLS, STABBING,

13:16.470 --> 13:16.930
RAPE, MURDER?

13:16.931 --> 13:18.629
I STEPPED IN TO EUROPE'S DEN OF

13:18.630 --> 13:22.829
DEPRAVITY.

13:22.830 --> 13:27.199
* BAD BOYS BAD BOYS

13:27.200 --> 13:28.669
>> SO IT WAS TIME TO MEET MY

13:28.670 --> 13:29.070
PARTNERS.

13:29.071 --> 13:33.629
>> HI, JIM.

13:33.630 --> 13:34.869
>> ALL RIGHT.

13:34.870 --> 13:37.029
LET'S GET SOME PEOPLE.

13:37.030 --> 13:44.629
>> WHAT'S THE NUMBER ONE CRIME?

13:44.630 --> 13:46.869
>> PICKPOCKETING.

13:46.870 --> 13:51.599
>> PICKPOCKETING IS THE NUMBER

13:51.600 --> 13:52.600
ONE CRIME?

13:52.601 --> 13:54.369
WHICH JURORS DO YOU HATE THE

13:54.370 --> 13:57.729
MOST, AUSTRALIANS OR BRITISH?

13:57.730 --> 13:59.229
>> THEY'RE DRUNK A LOT.

13:59.230 --> 14:02.899
>> AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO

14:02.900 --> 14:03.670
ASK US SOMETHING.

14:03.671 --> 14:05.229
>> THEY'RE SCARED OF YOU?

14:05.230 --> 14:06.000
>> THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE

14:06.001 --> 14:08.329
CONDITIONED TO BE SCARED OF

14:08.330 --> 14:09.170
THEIR OWN COPS.

14:09.171 --> 14:12.929
YOU SEEM LIKE A PRICKLY FELLOW.

14:12.930 --> 14:14.929
* BAD BOYS BAD BOYS

14:14.930 --> 14:17.429
>> YOU GUYS HAVE GUNS?

14:17.430 --> 14:18.400
>> YEAH.

14:18.401 --> 14:21.569
>> YOU EVER HAD TO DRAW YOUR

14:21.570 --> 14:21.900
GUNS?

14:21.900 --> 14:22.370
>> YEAH, ONCE.

14:22.371 --> 14:23.899
>> IS THIS A TRAGIC STORY?

14:23.900 --> 14:26.899
>> IF YOU ROB A BANK, I HAD TO

14:26.900 --> 14:27.330
SHOOT.

14:27.331 --> 14:28.429
AND I HIT HIM.

14:28.430 --> 14:31.769
HE WAS NOT DEAD, BUT I HIT HIM.

14:31.770 --> 14:33.629
I DID THAT IN 1983.

14:33.630 --> 14:35.069
>> WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME A

14:35.070 --> 14:36.070
POLICE OFFICER WAS KILLED IN THE

14:36.071 --> 14:37.169
LINE OF DUTY?

14:37.170 --> 14:38.499
>> ALSO A LONG TIME AGO.

14:38.500 --> 14:39.629
>> PEOPLE DON'T USE THE GUNS OR

14:39.630 --> 14:47.669
THE WEAPONS AGAINST THE POLICE.

14:47.670 --> 14:48.370
>> THIS RED LIGHT --

14:48.371 --> 14:50.629
>> THIS IS WHERE IT IS?

14:50.630 --> 14:54.169
>> I'LL HAVE A LOOK INSIDE --

14:54.170 --> 14:55.329
WHY IS EVERYONE WAIVING AT US?

14:55.330 --> 14:58.329
>> THEY LIKE US.

14:58.330 --> 15:00.369
>> IS MARIJUANA ACTUALLY LEGAL?

15:00.370 --> 15:01.000
>> NO.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.069
>> IT'S NOT LEGAL?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.899
>> ALL DRUGS ARE ILLEGAL, BUT

15:04.900 --> 15:07.429
BECAUSE THEY SELL IT IN THE

15:07.430 --> 15:12.669
SHOPS, WE CALL IT IN DUTCH --

15:12.670 --> 15:14.899
EFFECTIVE.

15:14.900 --> 15:15.430
>> JUST ACCEPT IT.

15:15.431 --> 15:16.669
I MEAN, IF THEY'RE SELLING IT IN

15:16.670 --> 15:18.069
THE SHOPS, THERE'S REALLY

15:18.070 --> 15:21.499
NOTHING A COP CAN DO, RIGHT?

15:21.500 --> 15:24.069
* BAD BOYS BAD BOYS

15:24.070 --> 15:27.169
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVEN'T

15:27.170 --> 15:28.869
EVEN HEARD THE RADIO, THERE

15:28.870 --> 15:30.399
ISN'T A CRIME?

15:30.400 --> 15:33.629
ANY PROBLEMS AT THE ANNE FRANK

15:33.630 --> 15:34.430
MUSEUM?

15:34.430 --> 15:35.430
DOES ANYTHING EVERYTHING HAPPEN

15:35.430 --> 15:35.770
THERE?

15:35.770 --> 15:36.670
>> NO, NO, NO.

15:36.671 --> 15:38.669
>> MAYBE THERE IS A CRIMINAL AT

15:38.670 --> 15:39.899
THE ANNE FRANK MUSEUM, BUT YOU

15:39.900 --> 15:43.229
JUST CAN'T FIND THEM.

15:43.230 --> 15:43.800
>> THERE'S NO CRIME?

15:43.800 --> 15:44.630
>> NONE.

15:44.631 --> 15:48.629
>> NONE.

15:48.630 --> 15:51.629
* BAD BOYS BAD BOYS

15:51.630 --> 15:54.369
* WHAT YOU GONNA DO

15:54.370 --> 15:56.329
* WHAT YOU GONNA DO WHEN THEY

15:56.330 --> 15:57.330
COME FOR YOU *

15:57.331 --> 15:59.399
* GOT NOTHING TO DO NOTHING

15:59.400 --> 15:59.730
TO --

15:59.731 --> 16:01.699
>> YOU MAY THINK THERE'S NO ONE

16:01.700 --> 16:03.669
HERE TO ARREST, BECAUSE SO MANY

16:03.670 --> 16:04.670
THINGS ARE LEGAL.

16:04.671 --> 16:07.969
BUT THE THING IS,

16:07.970 --> 16:12.099
DECRIMINALIZING SEX AND DRUGS

16:12.100 --> 16:13.499
HASN'T BROUGHT MORE CRIMES.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.329
THE TRUTH IS THE U.S. HAS MORE

16:15.330 --> 16:22.169
RAPES AND MURDERS PER CAPITA AND

16:22.170 --> 16:23.369
THAN EUROPE.

16:23.370 --> 16:25.569
>> I DON'T WATCH DUTCH MOVIES.

16:25.570 --> 16:26.570
>> YOU DON'T LIKE THEM?

16:26.571 --> 16:28.629
>> I RECKON YOU SIT DOWN AND

16:28.630 --> 16:32.199
WATCH MORE COP MOVIES.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.529
>> DEXTER.

16:33.530 --> 16:34.330
>> I LOVE HIM.

16:34.331 --> 16:36.669
>> THE CEREAL KILLER.

16:36.670 --> 16:39.329
>> I LOVE HIM.

16:39.330 --> 16:44.529
>> WE HAVE SOMETHING SPECIAL.

16:44.530 --> 16:45.030
SOMETHING NICE.

16:45.030 --> 16:45.930
>> I FEEL LIKE YOU RELATE TO HIM

16:45.931 --> 16:51.229
IN SOME WAY.

16:51.230 --> 16:54.499
>> YOU GUYS NOT DOING ANYTHING

16:54.500 --> 16:54.900
CRIMINAL?

16:54.901 --> 17:00.899
IF YOU SEE A CRIME, TELL

17:00.900 --> 17:01.330
SOMEONE.

17:01.331 --> 17:03.399
>> OKAY.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.099
>> HE WORKS FOR ME, IT'S ALL

17:04.099 --> 17:04.599
RIGHT.

17:04.601 --> 17:06.799
>> THE MORE WE WALKED, SOMETHING

17:06.800 --> 17:07.329
BECAME CLEAR.

17:07.330 --> 17:09.669
THESE GUYS DON'T JUST CRUISE

17:09.670 --> 17:11.628
AROUND CHATTING ABOUT TV SHOWS

17:11.630 --> 17:12.500
ALL NIGHT.

17:12.501 --> 17:13.769
THEY KNEW EVERYONE, AND PEOPLE

17:13.770 --> 17:15.128
WERE HAPPY TO SEE THEM.

17:15.130 --> 17:17.529
IN AMERICA, 44% OF ADULTS SAY

17:17.530 --> 17:19.729
THEY ONLY HAVE SOME OR VERY

17:19.730 --> 17:20.670
LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN THE POLICE.

17:20.671 --> 17:23.329
IF YOU'RE BLACK, THAT NUMBER

17:23.329 --> 17:24.598
JUMPS TO 62%.

17:24.599 --> 17:26.999
IN THE NETHERLANDS, 75% OF

17:27.000 --> 17:28.669
PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE

17:28.670 --> 17:29.400
IN THE COPS.

17:29.401 --> 17:31.769
SOME OF THE MOST TRUSTED POLICE

17:31.770 --> 17:32.230
IN THE WORLD.

17:32.231 --> 17:34.569
I NEED TO MAKE A QUICK STOP TO

17:34.570 --> 17:37.899
PROCESS WHAT I'VE BEEN SEEING.

17:37.900 --> 17:41.329
>> STOP OVER HERE?

17:41.330 --> 17:48.599
>> OF COURSE.

17:48.600 --> 17:51.329
>> SO, LET'S REVIEW.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.669
THE U.S. HAS SPENT BILLIONS OF

17:53.670 --> 17:55.699
DOLLARS ON THE WAR ON DRUGS.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.630
>> JUST SAY NO.

17:56.630 --> 17:57.470
>> JUST SAY NO.

17:57.471 --> 18:03.669
>> WHAT DO WE HAVE TO SHOW FOR

18:03.670 --> 18:04.170
IT?

18:04.171 --> 18:06.569
SHITLOADS OF PEOPLE STILL USING

18:06.570 --> 18:06.900
DRUGS.

18:06.901 --> 18:14.129
AND PEOPLE CONVICTED FOR SMOKING

18:14.130 --> 18:14.870
SOMETHING I JUST SMOKED WHILE

18:14.871 --> 18:17.569
AMSTERDAM COPS WAITED FOR ME TO

18:17.570 --> 18:20.669
FINISH SMOKING.

18:20.670 --> 18:22.629
YET AMSTERDAM IS CLOSING DOWN

18:22.630 --> 18:23.729
PRISONS BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS

18:23.730 --> 18:24.670
SO SAFE.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.329
I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING I NEED TO

18:27.330 --> 18:27.630
SEE.

18:27.631 --> 18:28.869
YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THE

18:28.870 --> 18:30.329
STATION AND WATCH SOME DEXTER?

18:30.330 --> 18:32.199
>> I LOVE IT, MAN.

18:32.200 --> 18:32.700
I LOVE IT MANY.

18:32.701 --> 18:36.830
>> WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

18:47.470 --> 18:48.330
>>> THAT'S OUR SHE.

18:48.330 --> 18:49.330
BEFORE WE GO.

18:49.331 --> 18:50.569
SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE THE NEWS

18:50.570 --> 18:52.629
IS FULL OF NOTHING BUT TRAGEDY,

18:52.630 --> 18:53.630
PAIN AND SADNESS.

18:53.630 --> 18:54.500
AND IT IS.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.799
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE

18:55.800 --> 18:57.569
CAN'T TRY TO FIND A SILVER

18:57.570 --> 18:58.829
LINING IN THE WORLD.

18:58.830 --> 19:01.199
SO LET'S PUT ON OUR ROSE COLORED

19:01.200 --> 19:03.469
GLASSES FOR A SEGMENT CUSTOM

19:03.470 --> 19:06.199
MADE TO GO VIRAL THAT WE CALL,

19:06.200 --> 19:09.769
AH, THIS IS NOT SO BAD.

19:09.770 --> 19:11.199
SUPREME COURT NOMINEE BRETT

19:11.200 --> 19:13.029
KAVANAUGH STAND AS CAUSED OF

19:13.030 --> 19:14.069
SEXUALLY ASSAULTING A WOMAN WHEN

19:14.070 --> 19:16.799
HE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

19:16.800 --> 19:17.999
AH, IT'S NOT SO BAD.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.829
AT LEAST NOW HE'LL BE IN THE

19:19.830 --> 19:21.499
SUPREME COURT WHERE HE CAN'T

19:21.500 --> 19:23.829
HURT ANY MORE WOMEN.

19:23.830 --> 19:27.829
APPLE HAS RELEASED THE MOST

19:27.830 --> 19:28.800
EXPENSIVE iPHONE EVER.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.499
AH, IT'S NOT SO BAD.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.169
SURE, $1500 FOR A PHONE SOUNDS

19:32.170 --> 19:33.569
LIKE A LOT.

19:33.570 --> 19:36.429
THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY, I CAN

19:36.430 --> 19:37.999
AFFORD ONE AND I'LL LET YOU CALL

19:38.000 --> 19:43.329
ME, SO THAT'S FUN FOR EVERYONE.

19:43.330 --> 19:45.529
THE FRENCH ART SCHOOL USED PHOTO

19:45.530 --> 19:49.899
SHOP TO DARKEN STUDENTS FEATURES

19:49.900 --> 19:52.729
AND ADD BLACK STUDENTS FOR AN

19:53.601 --> 19:55.799
ON THE UP SIDE WHOEVER DID THIS

19:55.800 --> 19:58.329
PUZZLE FOUND ALL OF THEM.

19:58.330 --> 20:02.129

20:02.130 --> 20:03.030
MODERN FAMILY HAS DECIDED TO

20:03.031 --> 20:04.899
KILL OFF ONE OF ITS MAIN

20:04.900 --> 20:06.499
CHARACTERS IN THE UPCOMING

20:06.500 --> 20:07.000
SEASON.

20:07.001 --> 20:09.599
AH, IT'S NOT SO BAD.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.369
MAYBE IT WILL BE MANNY.

20:11.370 --> 20:13.229
HE'LL GET KILLED AT THE HANDS OF
