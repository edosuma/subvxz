00:47.093 --> 00:49.742
Reynolds has made my
dreams come true.

00:51.766 --> 00:55.204
And I have given him what
he desires most in return.

00:56.844 --> 00:58.102
And what's that?

01:02.291 --> 01:04.174
Every piece of me.

01:07.340 --> 01:10.075
He's a very demanding man,
isn't he?

01:13.003 --> 01:15.354
Must be quite a challenge
to be with him.

01:16.167 --> 01:17.143
Yes.

01:18.526 --> 01:20.814
Maybe he is the
most demanding man.

02:54.795 --> 02:56.053
Morning, ladies.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.771
-Morning.
-Morning, Madame.

03:02.732 --> 03:04.005
Good morning, ladies.

03:25.591 --> 03:28.198
-Good morning, Biddy.
-Good morning, Mr. Woodcock.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.315
-Morning, Nana.
-Morning, Mr. Woodcock.

03:30.393 --> 03:31.995
-Pippa.
-Morning, sir.

04:15.587 --> 04:16.899
Try these.

04:19.899 --> 04:21.040
Reynolds?

04:21.844 --> 04:23.173
They're delicious.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.748
Remember I told you, Johanna?

04:27.407 --> 04:29.476
No more sludgy things.

04:31.587 --> 04:33.052
I didn’t know that.

04:36.165 --> 04:38.209
You may have told
it to someone else.

04:48.735 --> 04:49.782
Morning.

04:49.852 --> 04:51.852
Morning, my old so-and-so.

05:10.766 --> 05:12.851
Where have you gone, Reynolds?

05:15.876 --> 05:17.818
There's nothing I can say...

05:18.063 --> 05:21.014
to get your attention
aimed back at me...

05:21.782 --> 05:23.029
Is there?

05:25.788 --> 05:28.795
I cannot begin my day
with a confrontation.

05:28.929 --> 05:29.905
Please?

05:30.994 --> 05:33.041
I'm delivering the dress today...

05:33.783 --> 05:36.775
and I can't take up space
with a confrontation.

05:36.986 --> 05:39.697
I simply don't have time
for confrontations.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.045
Good morning, Countess.

06:18.263 --> 06:19.842
Good morning, Cyril.

06:20.131 --> 06:21.685
Good morning, Peter.

06:35.056 --> 06:37.134
Who's this beautiful stranger?

06:38.704 --> 06:41.689
I need to see you
far more often, Henrietta.

06:43.072 --> 06:44.876
I am very excited.

06:45.111 --> 06:47.541
I am, too. Come in.

07:23.637 --> 07:24.684
Exquisite.

07:53.943 --> 07:55.060
Yes?

07:55.466 --> 07:57.263
Let's take it for a walk.

08:12.074 --> 08:14.989
Beautiful work, ladies.
Thank you very much.

08:15.555 --> 08:17.735
It's beautiful, Reynolds.

08:19.949 --> 08:21.985
Worth everything
we've been through.

08:25.026 --> 08:27.396
I feel like it would
give me courage.

08:44.888 --> 08:47.631
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
take your seats, please.</i>

08:56.445 --> 08:58.008
-She here?
-Yes, sir.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.923
Well, what do you want to do
about Johanna?

09:27.329 --> 09:30.178
I mean, she's lovely,
but the time has come.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.453
And she's getting
fat sitting around

09:34.478 --> 09:36.891
waiting for you to fall
in love with her again.

09:40.267 --> 09:42.206
I'll give her the October dress.

09:44.282 --> 09:45.658
That's all right?

09:52.970 --> 09:55.177
I have an unsettled feeling...

09:55.954 --> 09:57.775
based on...

09:57.954 --> 10:00.401
nothing I can put my finger on.

10:00.798 --> 10:02.580
Just butterflies.

10:03.321 --> 10:06.964
Been having the strongest
memories of Mama lately.

10:07.728 --> 10:09.813
Coming to me in my dreams...

10:11.134 --> 10:12.898
Smelling her scent...

10:15.407 --> 10:17.481
The strongest sense that...

10:18.259 --> 10:19.864
she's near us.

10:21.462 --> 10:23.398
And reaching out towards us.

10:26.900 --> 10:30.492
Very much hope that she saw
the dress tonight, don't you?

10:32.610 --> 10:33.945
Yes.

10:35.423 --> 10:36.770
It's comforting

10:36.895 --> 10:40.145
to think the dead are watching
over the living.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.775
I don't find that spooky at all.

10:49.220 --> 10:51.552
Why don't you go
to the country tonight?

10:53.267 --> 10:54.649
I'll follow tomorrow.

10:55.868 --> 10:57.181
Good idea.

10:59.642 --> 11:01.489
I like that idea very much.

11:02.259 --> 11:04.052
My old so-and-so.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.538
Mr. Hansford?

11:59.053 --> 12:00.359
Mr. Hansford, hello?

12:00.510 --> 12:02.448
-Good morning.
-Morning.

12:02.546 --> 12:06.070
Fill us up please.
And check the oil and tires.

12:10.005 --> 12:11.090
Lots of frost this morning.

12:11.208 --> 12:12.945
It's cold, innit? It's very bitter.

13:37.828 --> 13:40.290
-Good morning.
-Morning.

13:40.883 --> 13:42.829
What would you like to order?

13:47.070 --> 13:48.790
A Welsh rabbit.

13:52.125 --> 13:54.619
With a poached egg
on top, please.

13:54.937 --> 13:56.323
Not too runny.

13:56.914 --> 13:58.385
And bacon.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.471
Scones.

14:01.406 --> 14:03.463
Butter, cream.

14:05.203 --> 14:06.346
Jam.

14:07.820 --> 14:09.190
Not strawberry.

14:11.781 --> 14:12.737
No.

14:13.875 --> 14:15.265
Raspberry.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.828
What else?

14:20.477 --> 14:21.625
Coffee or tea?

14:21.781 --> 14:23.197
Do you have lapsang?

14:24.375 --> 14:26.098
I'll have a pot
of lapsang, please.

14:26.221 --> 14:27.333
Good choice.

14:27.578 --> 14:29.144
And some sausages.

14:30.523 --> 14:32.390
And some sausages.

14:38.187 --> 14:39.562
Show me.

14:48.552 --> 14:50.216
Will you remember?

14:50.808 --> 14:52.012
Yes.

14:53.965 --> 14:55.309
I'm keeping this.

15:21.720 --> 15:22.805
And now?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.518
Will you have dinner with me?

15:30.143 --> 15:31.236
Yes.

15:45.649 --> 15:49.415
<i>For the hungry boy.
My name is Alma.</i>

16:13.593 --> 16:15.937
-Am I late?
-No.

16:43.231 --> 16:44.497
What do you think?

16:46.231 --> 16:47.098
Hm.

16:48.161 --> 16:49.560
I like the sauce.

16:50.778 --> 16:52.098
Custard.

16:57.169 --> 16:58.694
It's quite good.

17:05.723 --> 17:07.304
May I, Alma?

17:09.788 --> 17:11.888
I like to see who I'm talking to.

17:18.106 --> 17:19.192
Here.

17:31.126 --> 17:32.157
There you are.

17:32.331 --> 17:33.688
That's better.

17:35.470 --> 17:37.196
Does you mother have brown eyes?

17:39.168 --> 17:40.230
Green.

17:40.504 --> 17:42.027
Do you look very much like her?

17:43.718 --> 17:45.503
I don't know. I think so.

17:46.513 --> 17:47.934
Do you have a photograph?

17:49.130 --> 17:49.974
Yes.

17:50.255 --> 17:51.529
Will you let me see it?

17:52.365 --> 17:53.967
Not here, at home.

17:56.765 --> 17:57.999
Carry it with you.

18:00.109 --> 18:01.952
Always carry her with you.

18:06.626 --> 18:07.759
Where's yours?

18:08.725 --> 18:09.788
Your mother?

18:10.454 --> 18:12.311
She's here in the canvas.

18:17.770 --> 18:19.747
-What do you mean?
-Hm.

18:21.079 --> 18:24.368
You can sew almost anything
into the canvas of a coat.

18:27.304 --> 18:28.539
Secrets.

18:30.062 --> 18:31.094
Coins.

18:31.593 --> 18:33.445
Words, little messages.

18:35.139 --> 18:37.343
When I was a boy, I started to

18:37.444 --> 18:40.171
hide things in the linings
of the garments.

18:40.923 --> 18:43.056
Things that only
I knew were there.

18:44.711 --> 18:47.828
And over my breast, I have
a lock of my mother's hair.

18:48.851 --> 18:51.070
To keep her
close to me always.

18:53.328 --> 18:56.446
She's quite a remarkable woman.
She taught me my trade.

18:56.914 --> 19:00.039
So, I try to
never be without her.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.827
You must love her very much.

19:32.924 --> 19:33.908
Hello.

19:34.393 --> 19:36.386
This is Alma.
Say hello to Alma.

19:36.524 --> 19:37.394
Hello.

19:38.982 --> 19:40.576
Come on, come on.

19:40.779 --> 19:42.552
-Hello.
-Watch over the house.

20:01.740 --> 20:04.769
I made this dress for her
when I was 16 years old.

20:04.824 --> 20:05.957
Beautiful.

20:06.318 --> 20:08.889
It was for her second husband,
their wedding.

20:09.389 --> 20:11.858
My father had died
many years before.

20:12.682 --> 20:15.627
Our nanny, the evil
Miss Blackwood...

20:16.333 --> 20:18.370
"The Black Death"
we used to call her,

20:18.849 --> 20:21.966
because of superstition, she
refused to help me sew the dress

20:22.350 --> 20:25.029
as she believed it would
bring her bad fortune...

20:25.372 --> 20:26.779
to never be a bride.

20:27.359 --> 20:29.211
Not that anyone
would've had her.

20:29.772 --> 20:32.961
And she seemed ancient to us,
I've no idea how old she actually was.

20:33.009 --> 20:35.095
And monstrously ugly.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.576
So...

20:37.311 --> 20:40.670
I worked alone for months
and months, hunched over.

20:40.928 --> 20:43.874
Sewing and sweating and sewing.

20:45.148 --> 20:47.093
And the Black Death
never married anyway.

20:47.258 --> 20:49.429
The help I could've had from her.

20:49.957 --> 20:53.590
It was my sister, Cyril,
came to my rescue in the end.

20:55.146 --> 20:57.271
There were endless superstitions

20:57.470 --> 20:59.485
when making a wedding dress.

20:59.826 --> 21:02.833
Young girls are afraid they'll
never marry if they touch one.

21:03.045 --> 21:04.935
Models afraid they'll...

21:05.083 --> 21:08.528
marry only bald men
if they put one on.

21:12.119 --> 21:14.775
And where's the dress now?

21:18.174 --> 21:20.520
I have no idea
what happened to it.

21:20.887 --> 21:21.926
No idea.

21:22.176 --> 21:24.738
Um, it's probably turned
to ashes by now.

21:25.059 --> 21:26.817
Fallen to pieces.

21:29.083 --> 21:31.527
And... your sister?

21:32.020 --> 21:33.324
What?

21:34.427 --> 21:36.075
Did she ever marry?

21:37.723 --> 21:38.716
No.

21:39.864 --> 21:41.746
Come over, let's have a fire.

22:01.360 --> 22:04.915
If you want to have a staring
contest with me, you will lose.

22:08.353 --> 22:09.182
Hm.

22:23.709 --> 22:25.708
You are a very handsome man.

22:28.677 --> 22:31.341
You must be around
many beautiful women.

22:36.842 --> 22:37.889
Yes.

22:41.796 --> 22:43.335
Why are you not married?

22:44.116 --> 22:45.592
I make dresses.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.952
You cannot be married
when you make dresses?

22:50.373 --> 22:52.763
I'm certain I was
never meant to marry.

22:53.021 --> 22:55.107
I'm a confirmed bachelor.

22:58.147 --> 22:59.670
I'm incurable.

23:00.976 --> 23:01.999
Hmm.

23:05.058 --> 23:06.660
Marriage would
make me deceitful,

23:06.769 --> 23:08.840
and I don't ever want that.

23:12.171 --> 23:14.273
You sound so sure about things.

23:14.891 --> 23:16.477
I'm sure about that.

23:21.396 --> 23:23.857
I think you are
only acting strong.

23:25.280 --> 23:26.897
No, I am strong.

23:30.292 --> 23:31.417
For who?

23:31.581 --> 23:33.182
Not for me, I hope.

23:36.177 --> 23:40.142
I think it's the expectations
and assumptions of others...

23:40.954 --> 23:42.498
that cause heartache.

23:52.524 --> 23:54.282
Would you help me
with something?

23:56.430 --> 23:57.860
-Yes.
-Come on.

24:12.271 --> 24:14.653
Good, just jump up
on the box for me.

25:13.770 --> 25:14.942
Um...

25:18.605 --> 25:20.258
I think we're going to try and...

25:21.385 --> 25:23.189
pull this back for you.

25:49.062 --> 25:50.320
Pretty good.

25:51.031 --> 25:52.234
A moment.

25:57.412 --> 26:00.475
Save that one for
another time.

26:07.973 --> 26:09.216
Quite nice.

26:13.818 --> 26:14.974
Hmm.

26:17.642 --> 26:19.158
Dead serious.

26:35.248 --> 26:36.434
This one.

26:38.692 --> 26:39.926
Do you like it?

26:41.888 --> 26:44.279
-Yes.
-It's pretty good.

26:54.744 --> 26:55.752
That's it.

26:56.415 --> 26:58.220
Let's get that off you and then...

26:58.431 --> 27:00.829
I'd like to take your measurements.
Is that all right?

27:17.276 --> 27:21.119
And who is this lovely creature
making the house smell so nice?

27:21.869 --> 27:23.517
Hello, I'm Alma.

27:24.433 --> 27:25.629
I'm Cyril.

27:30.215 --> 27:32.332
Sandalwood and rose water.

27:39.092 --> 27:42.577
Hmm, sherry... and...

27:43.383 --> 27:44.977
lemon juice?

27:45.907 --> 27:48.587
Mm, mm-hmm, we had
fish for dinner.

27:49.064 --> 27:52.002
My old sew-and-sew.
Would you mind?

28:33.417 --> 28:35.776
Will you step towards me.
Ready?

28:40.902 --> 28:42.199
Thirty-two.

28:44.854 --> 28:45.987
Thirty.

28:47.915 --> 28:49.118
Thirty-one.

28:54.264 --> 28:56.405
Thirty-five and a half.

29:01.860 --> 29:03.329
Fourteen and a half.

29:03.845 --> 29:05.322
Seventeen.

29:05.564 --> 29:06.767
Twenty.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.071
Just stand normally.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.134
Yes.

29:13.563 --> 29:14.692
I stand normally.

29:14.762 --> 29:16.090
Like before.

29:17.235 --> 29:18.692
-What do you mean?
-Straight.

29:18.794 --> 29:19.544
Straight?

29:19.575 --> 29:21.388
-Like that.
-Yeah, you didn't say that.

29:30.722 --> 29:32.347
Sixteen and a half.

29:36.355 --> 29:37.620
Eight and a half.

29:38.011 --> 29:40.988
You have no breasts.
Twenty-two.

29:42.354 --> 29:44.179
-Yes, I know.
-Thirty-two and a half.

29:44.265 --> 29:45.640
You can drop your arm now.

29:46.261 --> 29:47.444
I'm sorry.

29:47.663 --> 29:49.206
No, no, you're perfect.

29:50.030 --> 29:51.733
My job to give you some.

29:54.413 --> 29:55.897
If I choose to.

29:58.803 --> 29:59.896
Ten.

30:01.385 --> 30:02.448
Nine.

30:03.526 --> 30:04.760
Six and a half.

30:06.842 --> 30:09.452
Twenty...five.

30:10.249 --> 30:12.097
And... forty-five.

30:12.457 --> 30:13.566
That's it.

30:21.603 --> 30:23.220
Would you try
something else for me?

30:23.697 --> 30:24.720
Yes.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.230
You have the ideal shape.

30:39.515 --> 30:40.930
-I do?
-Hm.

30:42.422 --> 30:43.946
He likes a little belly.

31:06.194 --> 31:08.030
<i>I never really liked myself.</i>

31:10.799 --> 31:12.486
<i>I thought my...</i>

31:13.611 --> 31:15.290
<i>shoulders were too wide.</i>

31:16.080 --> 31:19.283
<i>My neck was
skinny like a bird.</i>

31:20.968 --> 31:22.734
<i>That I had no breasts.</i>

31:25.574 --> 31:28.731
<i>I felt my...
hips were larger than needed.</i>

31:28.967 --> 31:31.085
<i>And my arms strong.</i>

31:36.766 --> 31:40.164
I feel as if I've been looking
for you for a very long time.

31:46.304 --> 31:47.531
You found me.

31:53.063 --> 31:54.884
Whatever you do...

31:55.829 --> 31:57.446
do it carefully.

32:10.650 --> 32:13.072
<i>But in his work,
I've become perfect.</i>

32:14.400 --> 32:16.299
<i>And I feel just right.</i>

32:27.514 --> 32:31.139
<i>Maybe that's how all women
feel...in his clothes.</i>

33:01.527 --> 33:03.285
You look beautiful.

33:03.832 --> 33:04.941
Really.

33:05.590 --> 33:07.058
Very beautiful.

33:07.786 --> 33:10.700
You're making me
extremely hungry.

33:12.912 --> 33:16.053
-I ordered you a steak tartare.
-Oh, perfect. Thank you.

33:16.147 --> 33:17.858
My little carnivore.

33:18.731 --> 33:21.788
I've just been on the telephone
to your favorite client.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.131
Mm-hmm.

33:23.699 --> 33:26.121
Barbara Rose is getting
married again.

33:26.798 --> 33:28.157
Oh, goody.

33:28.912 --> 33:30.826
All right, well...

33:30.943 --> 33:32.990
I think I better have
another one of these.

33:49.802 --> 33:51.091
That's your room.

33:52.832 --> 33:54.551
I'm right next door.

33:58.286 --> 33:59.428
Get your rest.

33:59.582 --> 34:01.988
We'll start early
in the morning.

34:03.027 --> 34:04.395
How early?

34:07.029 --> 34:08.179
I'll wake you.

34:10.202 --> 34:11.241
Night.

34:12.233 --> 34:13.342
Goodnight.

34:30.601 --> 34:35.273
<i>Sometimes, we wake up
at four in the morning...</i>

34:36.165 --> 34:38.540
<i>after we'd gone to
bed at midnight.</i>

34:39.783 --> 34:41.681
<i>And then he's ready
to start again.</i>

34:44.226 --> 34:46.460
And I can stand endlessly.

34:48.079 --> 34:50.344
No one can stand
as long as I can.

34:51.949 --> 34:53.641
What is it, Alma?

34:54.728 --> 34:57.438
What are you looking
so forlorn about, hm?

34:58.210 --> 34:59.445
I don't know, I...

34:59.851 --> 35:02.430
I don't think I like
the fabric so much.

35:06.019 --> 35:08.800
Well, Alma, this fabric is adored

35:08.854 --> 35:10.995
by the women who
wear our design.

35:12.649 --> 35:14.500
It's perfect for this dress.

35:15.016 --> 35:16.649
Cyril is right.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.000
Cyril is always right.

35:22.300 --> 35:24.184
It's not because the
fabric is adored

35:24.248 --> 35:26.535
by the clients
that Cyril is right.

35:26.688 --> 35:28.673
It's right because it's right.

35:29.958 --> 35:31.513
Because it's beautiful.

35:33.794 --> 35:36.230
Maybe one day you will
change your taste, Alma.

35:39.934 --> 35:41.254
Maybe not.

35:41.982 --> 35:43.936
Maybe you have no taste.

35:45.915 --> 35:47.665
Maybe I like my own taste.

35:48.998 --> 35:51.577
Yeah, it's just enough
to get you into trouble.

35:53.247 --> 35:54.778
Perhaps I'm looking for trouble.

35:54.859 --> 35:56.084
Stop.

36:01.449 --> 36:03.275
Excuse me, Mr. Woodcock.

36:03.408 --> 36:04.341
Yes?

36:05.293 --> 36:06.676
I would like to say
that I hope one day

36:06.832 --> 36:08.870
I could wear one
of your dresses.

36:09.575 --> 36:10.637
Well, thank you.

36:10.754 --> 36:13.091
If that's your wish, I hope
it comes true for you.

36:13.418 --> 36:14.495
She really means it.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.419
She told me she wants to be
buried in a dress that you made.

36:20.183 --> 36:21.233
-Thank you.
-Thank you,

36:21.312 --> 36:23.351
ladies for your kind words.
Good night.

36:23.754 --> 36:24.732
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

36:24.757 --> 36:26.724
-Good night.
-Good night. Thank you very much.

36:27.465 --> 36:30.162
You'd dig her up and sell the
dress again, wouldn't you, Nigel?

36:30.225 --> 36:31.889
Well, otherwise it would seem to

36:31.920 --> 36:34.709
be going to a waste,
but yeah, any wombat can try.

36:34.736 --> 36:37.080
Nigel, why don't you
watch your words?

36:37.270 --> 36:38.575
What?

36:40.668 --> 36:42.449
Have you had enough to eat?

36:48.301 --> 36:49.869
You seem thirsty.

37:22.328 --> 37:23.797
Morning, Reynolds.

37:27.599 --> 37:29.122
Morning, Cyril.

38:02.963 --> 38:06.213
Please, don't move
so much, Alma.

38:09.394 --> 38:13.119
I'm...buttering my toast.
I'm not moving too much.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.580
Well, it's too much.

38:14.996 --> 38:17.732
It's a distraction.
It's very distracting.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.791
Maybe you...

38:22.925 --> 38:24.729
pay too much attention to it.

38:27.095 --> 38:28.915
It's hard to ignore.

38:29.251 --> 38:31.907
It's as if you just rode
a horse across the room.

38:37.712 --> 38:39.258
It's too much movement.

38:40.233 --> 38:43.522
It's entirely too much
movement at breakfast.

38:58.965 --> 39:01.403
Perhaps you should take
your breakfast after him.

39:04.211 --> 39:05.562
Or in your room?

39:08.198 --> 39:10.010
I think he's being too fussy.

39:10.182 --> 39:13.807
His routine when he's in it
is best not shaken.

39:14.010 --> 39:16.166
-Well...
-This is a quiet time.

39:17.433 --> 39:19.222
Not to be misused.

39:20.889 --> 39:22.311
If breakfast isn't right,

39:22.336 --> 39:25.624
it's very hard for him to recover
for the rest of the day.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.217
I didn't know that.

39:28.403 --> 39:29.911
No, of course you didn't.

39:31.872 --> 39:33.295
But you do now.

39:37.728 --> 39:39.725
Still, I think he's too fussy.

39:43.365 --> 39:45.139
Well, that's as may be.

39:54.748 --> 39:56.233
This is...

39:56.282 --> 40:00.001
Flemish bobbin lace
from the late 1600s.

40:00.034 --> 40:02.830
It's very rare, very precious.

40:02.971 --> 40:05.995
<i>I rescued it from
Antwerp during the war.</i>

40:06.284 --> 40:08.682
I've been waiting for
the right moment to...

40:09.494 --> 40:11.354
<i>to make something with it.</i>

40:18.152 --> 40:19.207
Hold it.

40:19.496 --> 40:21.553
That's very nice.
That's beautiful.

40:21.655 --> 40:23.186
-Very nice.
-Best yet.

40:23.818 --> 40:24.745
Beautiful.

40:24.855 --> 40:27.551
And, um, just look towards
the window, please, Alma.

40:28.203 --> 40:31.016
Amber, could-could you
just lift the bodice...

40:31.836 --> 40:32.891
a little bit.

40:33.281 --> 40:34.615
It keeps dropping down.

40:34.757 --> 40:36.749
We need to get that
adjusted properly.

40:36.828 --> 40:38.383
It's ridiculous.

40:39.138 --> 40:40.616
Just get it fixed.

40:40.653 --> 40:41.317
Yes, sir.

40:41.387 --> 40:43.191
It should've been ready today,
quite honestly.

40:43.262 --> 40:44.576
I don't understand why...

40:45.109 --> 40:47.320
-I'm not sitting on the floor.
-Sit on the floor.

40:50.053 --> 40:51.733
Ah, that's great.

40:52.069 --> 40:53.202
That's great.

40:53.855 --> 40:55.152
Enough.

40:55.488 --> 40:57.019
Have I finished yet?

40:57.707 --> 40:59.113
All right, that's it.

40:59.224 --> 41:00.813
I need to do some work.

41:00.945 --> 41:01.922
Hell.

41:22.112 --> 41:23.248
Yes?

41:25.026 --> 41:26.362
May I come in?

41:28.784 --> 41:30.089
I'm working.

41:34.121 --> 41:35.714
Do you need anything?

41:53.230 --> 41:56.262
Just pull this over the shoulders.

41:56.334 --> 41:57.920
Show the dress...

41:58.287 --> 41:59.998
and put it on completely.

42:03.095 --> 42:04.378
Good, good, good.

42:04.758 --> 42:06.259
Alma...she ready?

42:06.307 --> 42:07.759
Me? wait.

42:09.992 --> 42:11.562
Come on, please.

42:35.574 --> 42:36.730
Ingrid?

42:38.519 --> 42:40.137
Cape's wrong, let me do it.

42:40.715 --> 42:41.872
Let me do it.

43:14.431 --> 43:15.868
Ellie, ready?

43:15.955 --> 43:18.126
Let's have a look at you.
Stand here.

43:39.122 --> 43:40.262
All right.

43:42.370 --> 43:44.589
Off you go, thank you.
Ingrid, you ready?

44:00.613 --> 44:01.964
Let me do it, let me do it.

44:07.816 --> 44:09.376
You're no good to me
just standing there.

44:09.587 --> 44:11.244
-I-I need your hands...
-Sorry, sir.

44:13.962 --> 44:15.603
Just go. Go, go!

44:16.595 --> 44:17.736
I'm sorry.

44:55.885 --> 44:57.433
Let me drive for you.

45:25.378 --> 45:26.667
<i>You see, when you...</i>

45:27.190 --> 45:28.706
<i>when you love your work...</i>

45:29.276 --> 45:30.667
<i>and you can give</i>

45:31.128 --> 45:32.456
<i>like he does...</i>

45:33.609 --> 45:34.711
<i>you need...</i>

45:34.882 --> 45:36.711
<i>to come down...</i>

45:37.409 --> 45:38.776
<i>again.</i>

45:41.015 --> 45:42.460
<i>And then, he's...</i>

45:43.195 --> 45:44.640
<i>he's a baby, he's...</i>

45:45.007 --> 45:46.773
like a spoiled little baby.

45:50.117 --> 45:51.804
When he's like this, he's...

45:52.702 --> 45:54.226
very tender.

45:54.679 --> 45:56.000
<i>Open.</i>

46:04.731 --> 46:06.621
How long would these
episodes last?

46:08.425 --> 46:09.989
Only a few days and...

46:10.379 --> 46:11.918
then he's well again.

46:30.927 --> 46:32.888
No, Alma, what are you doing?

46:33.208 --> 46:34.302
It's tea for you.

46:34.380 --> 46:36.028
Don't put the tray on
the table, please.

46:36.154 --> 46:37.482
Just take it off.

46:37.576 --> 46:38.982
I didn't ask for tea.

46:39.704 --> 46:40.892
No, but...

46:41.767 --> 46:42.962
Take it out, please.

46:43.180 --> 46:44.610
Yes, I can take it out.

46:45.817 --> 46:46.989
It's a bit late now, isn't it?

46:47.044 --> 46:48.535
I'm taking it out.

46:48.559 --> 46:50.723
Yeah, but it's a bit
late now, isn't it?

46:50.947 --> 46:52.267
But I'm taking it out.

46:52.409 --> 46:53.556
The tea is going out.

46:53.596 --> 46:56.485
The interruption is staying
right here with me.

47:15.547 --> 47:18.539
What if they
are yellow underneath

47:18.564 --> 47:20.063
and white on top?

47:22.262 --> 47:24.521
The poisoned ones have gills.

47:25.562 --> 47:27.137
Look at the book in the kitchen.

47:32.976 --> 47:34.410
We cook them in fat?

47:35.339 --> 47:37.105
No, we'll cook them in butter.

47:37.898 --> 47:39.250
But not too much.

47:40.165 --> 47:43.055
Mr. Woodcock detests
too much butter.

48:34.430 --> 48:36.741
There's a very good chance
Barbara Rose will ask you

48:36.766 --> 48:38.437
to attend her wedding.

48:45.096 --> 48:46.870
What do you want me
to do with that?

48:53.954 --> 48:55.696
Accept her invitation.

48:57.376 --> 48:58.649
You can stomach it.

49:03.099 --> 49:06.006
I really wish I hadn't heard
this till later on, Cyril.

49:06.702 --> 49:08.038
It's very unsettling.

49:11.423 --> 49:12.353
Well...

49:13.595 --> 49:14.720
Chin up.

49:21.250 --> 49:23.351
Barbara Rose pays
for this house.

49:36.760 --> 49:38.018
All right?

49:43.723 --> 49:45.028
Morning, Barbara.

49:45.907 --> 49:48.453
Morning, Cal. Morning, Tippy.

49:48.625 --> 49:50.719
Morning, Mr. Woodcock.

49:55.282 --> 49:56.692
Reynolds.

49:59.091 --> 50:00.630
Let's get started.

50:22.759 --> 50:24.720
Just going to lift this up, Barbara.

50:34.913 --> 50:37.389
I know you're doing
the best you can.

50:39.808 --> 50:41.015
Don't do that.

50:41.100 --> 50:43.608
-Take your hand away, please.
-I'm still so ugly.

50:43.689 --> 50:46.189
Barbara, I'm trying to make
you a beautiful dress.

50:49.432 --> 50:50.729
I need your help.

50:59.030 --> 51:00.273
Oh, please.

51:12.157 --> 51:13.955
Reynolds, will you come?

51:14.158 --> 51:15.807
Stand still, please.

51:16.419 --> 51:18.801
It's really not my place, Barbara.

51:19.098 --> 51:20.621
This is what I do.

51:21.798 --> 51:23.837
This is my place here.

51:24.891 --> 51:27.142
I'm afraid I must insist

51:27.167 --> 51:29.069
that you come.

51:38.339 --> 51:40.050
<i>George Riley, News of the World.</i>

51:40.282 --> 51:41.930
Who would be attendant
at the wedding?

51:41.985 --> 51:44.047
Oh, my son, Cal.

51:44.486 --> 51:45.510
My Cal.

51:45.557 --> 51:47.775
My son is so wonderful.

51:47.963 --> 51:51.010
He's so in favor of this marriage.

51:51.135 --> 51:52.580
John Evans, Daily Mail.

51:52.619 --> 51:54.565
And what of
your holdings, Ms. Rose?

51:54.709 --> 51:57.615
Do they become
Dominican property?

51:57.699 --> 51:58.706
Oh, I don't think so.

51:58.760 --> 52:02.408
If I may say, we are being
married under Dominican law, but

52:03.035 --> 52:04.925
in my country,
her money belongs to her

52:04.950 --> 52:06.544
and my money belongs to me.

52:06.728 --> 52:08.301
Anyway, why would
I need her money?

52:08.371 --> 52:09.704
I have enough of my own.

52:10.454 --> 52:12.087
What's Barbara brought
into your life?

52:12.874 --> 52:15.319
I brought sincerity into his life.

52:16.113 --> 52:17.773
-Sincerity?
-One kiss for the cameras.

52:17.828 --> 52:19.457
Go on, give us a kiss for
the camera, Ms. Rose.

52:19.551 --> 52:22.467
The answer to the question...
is sincerity.

52:22.514 --> 52:23.515
Let's give them a
kiss for the cameras.

52:23.585 --> 52:26.632
Rubio, tell us about selling visas
to the Jews during the war.

52:27.994 --> 52:29.267
Visas to Jews?

52:29.595 --> 52:30.978
Thank you very much.

52:32.321 --> 52:33.363
Jews, visas?

53:34.366 --> 53:36.413
That dress doesn't belong here.

53:37.750 --> 53:40.258
-Don't start crying.
-I'm not crying.

53:42.727 --> 53:43.894
I'm angry.

53:43.957 --> 53:46.317
-Don't start blubbering, Alma.
-I'm not blubbering.

53:50.885 --> 53:52.635
She doesn't deserve it.

53:54.182 --> 53:55.675
It's your work!

54:07.711 --> 54:08.750
Come on.

54:13.312 --> 54:14.226
Tippy?

54:16.268 --> 54:17.252
Mr. Woodcock.

54:17.431 --> 54:19.142
-What is it?
-I would like the dress back.

54:19.338 --> 54:21.142
Ms. Rose is sleeping.

54:21.273 --> 54:22.681
Well, it's got nothing
to do with the dress.

54:22.751 --> 54:24.460
Can you go and
get it for me, please?

54:24.642 --> 54:26.064
She's sleeping.

54:28.254 --> 54:29.660
In the dress?

54:30.551 --> 54:32.082
Well, yes.

54:33.262 --> 54:37.512
Go and take the dress off her
and bring it to me right away.

54:38.328 --> 54:39.219
I don't think so.

54:39.290 --> 54:41.274
Take the fucking
dress off Barbara

54:41.299 --> 54:43.001
and bring it to me
or I'll do it myself!

54:43.056 --> 54:44.642
I beg your pardon?

54:45.795 --> 54:47.045
Alma.

55:06.933 --> 55:07.745
Ah!

55:21.317 --> 55:22.286
Ah!

55:23.614 --> 55:24.559
Oh.

55:25.841 --> 55:27.192
Hello, Mr. Woodcock.

55:27.465 --> 55:28.379
Cal.

55:35.695 --> 55:36.687
I...

55:36.891 --> 55:38.742
It's no business of ours...

55:39.017 --> 55:41.471
what Mrs. Rose decides
to do with her life.

55:41.883 --> 55:44.109
But she can no longer
behave like this...

55:44.192 --> 55:46.848
in a dress by the
House of Woodcock!

56:14.367 --> 56:15.378
Thank you.

56:21.101 --> 56:22.390
I love you.

56:30.798 --> 56:33.142
-At the gray, that's the mother.
-Gracie?

56:33.555 --> 56:36.274
Um, she can wear something
like that, but...

56:36.485 --> 56:38.167
-I'll introduce her to...
-It's Mona's day.

56:38.268 --> 56:38.940
Yes, it is.

56:38.995 --> 56:40.222
I'd like to make
something for her.

56:40.269 --> 56:41.217
Yes, of course.

56:41.295 --> 56:42.591
She mentioned that last time...

56:42.616 --> 56:44.835
-Did she? Did she really?
-Yeah.

56:45.178 --> 56:46.210
All right.

56:47.163 --> 56:48.710
-Julie?
-Yes, sir.

56:48.781 --> 56:50.328
-Do we have porridge?
-Yes, we do.

56:50.365 --> 56:52.701
-Um, do we have cream?
-We do, yes.

56:52.763 --> 56:54.208
-Thick cream?
-Oh, yes.

56:54.258 --> 56:56.883
-That's what I'd like.
-Porridge's set.

56:57.031 --> 56:58.994
-Don't forget the salt.
-I shan't, I shan't.

56:59.064 --> 57:01.080
Oh, Alma, would you
like some porridge?

57:01.151 --> 57:02.487
-Yes.
-This morning?

57:02.525 --> 57:04.908
-Some for Alma, as well.
-Right, you are.

57:05.036 --> 57:07.224
And um, bacon and eggs.

57:07.309 --> 57:08.515
All right, sir.

57:10.669 --> 57:11.739
Morning.

57:13.923 --> 57:15.400
I'm so hungry.

57:16.594 --> 57:18.564
Delighted that we have
cream in the house.

57:18.650 --> 57:19.579
Yes.

57:19.689 --> 57:20.955
Makes all the difference.

57:21.492 --> 57:23.252
It's essential with porridge.

57:23.353 --> 57:24.986
A little bit naughty, though.

57:34.453 --> 57:35.562
Dear Reynolds.

57:35.680 --> 57:37.062
Your Royal Highness.

57:37.141 --> 57:38.633
Happy...you're welcome.

57:42.086 --> 57:43.195
How nice to see you.

57:43.273 --> 57:44.286
Your Royal Highness.

57:44.344 --> 57:45.485
Cyril!

57:46.476 --> 57:48.341
Hello, how lovely to see you.

58:03.674 --> 58:04.752
S'il vous plaît.

58:09.703 --> 58:11.878
<i>When you dream about
your wedding dress,</i>

58:11.940 --> 58:13.604
<i>what is it that you dream?</i>

58:14.523 --> 58:17.446
<i>I dream that it's the most
beautiful wedding dress</i>

58:17.548 --> 58:18.806
in the world.

58:20.009 --> 58:21.236
Naturally.

58:21.665 --> 58:23.808
Perhaps the only wedding
dress in the world.

58:23.901 --> 58:25.135
Yes.

58:26.549 --> 58:29.510
Well, to take it just
a little step further,

58:29.759 --> 58:33.783
perhaps the only wedding
dress that was ever made.

58:35.439 --> 58:36.485
Oui.

58:37.703 --> 58:40.968
Is Your Royal Highness a gold
person or a silver person?

58:41.803 --> 58:43.733
-Silver.
-Good.

58:44.065 --> 58:45.354
Lace or pearl?

58:45.659 --> 58:46.948
Lace.

58:48.402 --> 58:49.420
Very good.

58:49.660 --> 58:50.621
Merci.

59:21.211 --> 59:23.805
I want to wish you...

59:24.742 --> 59:26.602
good fortune for your wedding.

59:27.247 --> 59:28.434
Thank you.

59:29.448 --> 59:31.255
Je m'appelle Alma.

59:33.372 --> 59:35.232
Lovely to meet you, Alma.

59:38.812 --> 59:40.391
I live here.

59:58.274 --> 59:59.532
Come in.

01:00:02.165 --> 01:00:03.173
Alma.

01:00:03.868 --> 01:00:05.158
Morning, Cyril.

01:00:07.688 --> 01:00:09.704
I wanted to ask your help.

01:00:10.032 --> 01:00:12.884
In a gift I wanted to
make for Reynolds.

01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:18.569
I want to make him a surprise.

01:00:20.374 --> 01:00:22.211
If everyone left...

01:00:22.867 --> 01:00:24.078
the house...

01:00:24.351 --> 01:00:27.327
when he takes his
walk on Thursday,

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.588
I will cook for him dinner.

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:33.800
And when he comes back,
no one will be there but me.

01:00:34.050 --> 01:00:35.761
I'll be waiting for him.

01:00:36.443 --> 01:00:38.896
I will surprise him
and we can have dinner

01:00:39.005 --> 01:00:40.989
together, just the two of us.

01:00:42.513 --> 01:00:44.114
Do you like this idea?

01:00:44.692 --> 01:00:46.059
Would you help me?

01:00:47.977 --> 01:00:49.539
It isn't his birthday.

01:00:50.703 --> 01:00:51.914
I know.

01:00:53.203 --> 01:00:55.125
I would advise
against this, Alma.

01:00:55.608 --> 01:00:56.743
Why?

01:00:56.822 --> 01:00:58.219
Because he doesn't
like surprises.

01:00:58.336 --> 01:01:00.389
-He does.
-Well, he won't like this one.

01:01:02.476 --> 01:01:04.500
I'm trying to surprise him.

01:01:04.946 --> 01:01:07.352
And love him the way
that I want to.

01:01:10.554 --> 01:01:13.711
Well, if you're looking for
something kind...to do...

01:01:14.344 --> 01:01:16.703
perhaps, you could
think of something else.

01:01:17.187 --> 01:01:19.273
No, I really must advise
against this, Alma.

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:21.055
I don't think there
could be a more

01:01:21.149 --> 01:01:23.313
inappropriate time to
try something new.

01:01:23.445 --> 01:01:24.937
This is what I want to do.

01:01:25.453 --> 01:01:27.531
And I think
it will be very nice.

01:01:30.301 --> 01:01:32.589
With respect to your advice, Cyril...

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.913
but I have to know him
in my own way.

01:01:37.827 --> 01:01:40.046
And this is what
I want to do for him.

01:01:43.502 --> 01:01:44.502
Good night.

01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:58.690
Good luck.

01:02:38.236 --> 01:02:39.674
Oh, Alma.

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:41.127
What is this?

01:02:41.583 --> 01:02:43.247
I love you, Reynolds.

01:02:46.279 --> 01:02:48.287
Yes, but, what is this?

01:02:49.416 --> 01:02:50.948
It's a surprise.

01:02:52.353 --> 01:02:53.658
Are you hungry?

01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:55.778
Where's Cyril?

01:02:57.129 --> 01:02:58.840
I've sent everyone home.

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.314
Where is Cyril?

01:03:04.103 --> 01:03:05.166
She's left.

01:03:05.367 --> 01:03:06.970
What time did she leave?

01:03:07.994 --> 01:03:09.423
This afternoon.

01:03:12.257 --> 01:03:13.968
I've made us dinner.

01:03:33.031 --> 01:03:35.812
Let me collect myself...
for a moment.

01:03:37.211 --> 01:03:38.914
I'll just have a bath, I think.

01:03:40.898 --> 01:03:42.742
This is very kind of you, Alma.

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:45.594
Would you like a champagne
or a martini?

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.899
No, thank you.

01:03:48.439 --> 01:03:50.431
Oh, is that your dress?

01:03:50.684 --> 01:03:53.216
It's finished?
Let's go look at it.

01:04:01.207 --> 01:04:02.082
Hm.

01:04:02.301 --> 01:04:03.926
It's rather interesting.

01:04:05.434 --> 01:04:06.738
Very good work.

01:04:07.426 --> 01:04:08.934
I'll just have my bath now.

01:04:10.298 --> 01:04:11.900
When will Cyril get back?

01:04:12.213 --> 01:04:14.135
Mm, tonight.

01:04:49.479 --> 01:04:51.862
How was your appointment
with the princess?

01:04:56.854 --> 01:05:00.096
She's very beautiful like
a sculpture of some kind.

01:05:06.494 --> 01:05:07.698
Mm-hmm.

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:13.503
So, will you make
her a wedding gown?

01:05:17.292 --> 01:05:19.456
I have made her baptism,

01:05:19.886 --> 01:05:23.488
her first communion,
and confirmation dresses.

01:05:24.061 --> 01:05:26.472
I made the dress for her
presentation at court,

01:05:26.497 --> 01:05:30.006
indeed, the entire wardrobe
for her coming out season.

01:05:31.043 --> 01:05:33.090
It's only right that I should
make her wedding dress,

01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:34.754
wouldn't you think?

01:05:36.907 --> 01:05:39.040
No, but this is not...

01:05:39.610 --> 01:05:43.165
what I wanted to say, I'm-I'm sorry,
I don't know what I said, I...

01:05:43.765 --> 01:05:45.976
This is meant to be
nice evening.

01:05:47.742 --> 01:05:49.188
Let me serve you.

01:06:26.122 --> 01:06:27.450
Do you like it?

01:06:29.481 --> 01:06:30.630
I do.

01:06:34.075 --> 01:06:35.395
No, you don't.

01:06:36.715 --> 01:06:38.254
You don't like it at all.

01:06:38.826 --> 01:06:41.334
Usually, you always tell
me what you think.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:43.678
What is this?

01:06:44.147 --> 01:06:45.467
You're lying.

01:06:51.425 --> 01:06:55.632
As I think you know, Alma,
I prefer my asparagus with

01:06:55.687 --> 01:06:57.374
oil and salt.

01:06:58.983 --> 01:07:00.186
And knowing this,

01:07:00.241 --> 01:07:02.911
you've prepared the
asparagus with butter.

01:07:03.064 --> 01:07:05.830
Now, I can imagine
in certain circumstances

01:07:05.916 --> 01:07:07.783
being able to pretend

01:07:07.877 --> 01:07:10.197
that I like it made this way.

01:07:12.284 --> 01:07:15.144
Right now, I'm just
admiring my own gallantry

01:07:15.247 --> 01:07:17.747
for eating it the way
you've prepared it.

01:07:19.489 --> 01:07:21.293
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

01:07:24.753 --> 01:07:27.300
I... I don't know
what I'm doing here.

01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:30.277
I'm just waiting around like a

01:07:30.442 --> 01:07:32.363
idiot for you.

01:07:34.238 --> 01:07:37.183
This was an ambush, Alma.
To what purpose?

01:07:37.644 --> 01:07:39.003
This is not...

01:07:39.635 --> 01:07:41.956
I know it's not going
as I expected, I...

01:07:42.019 --> 01:07:43.800
I didn't mean these
things to come out.

01:07:43.825 --> 01:07:45.371
I'm sorry, but
it was meant to be nice.

01:07:45.426 --> 01:07:46.957
Well, what <i>did</i> you expect?

01:07:47.004 --> 01:07:50.246
I wanted time with you.
I wanted to have you to myself.

01:07:50.362 --> 01:07:51.991
You have me all the time.

01:07:52.085 --> 01:07:53.491
-No!
-What are you talking about?

01:07:53.555 --> 01:07:55.218
I don't! I... there...

01:07:55.311 --> 01:07:57.093
There are always people around.

01:07:57.219 --> 01:07:59.750
And if not, then there's
something between us.

01:07:59.781 --> 01:08:00.717
Something between us?

01:08:00.751 --> 01:08:02.282
-Yes.
-What?

01:08:02.701 --> 01:08:04.037
Some...

01:08:04.857 --> 01:08:05.639
What?

01:08:05.664 --> 01:08:07.162
Distance!

01:08:09.055 --> 01:08:10.319
When did this happen?

01:08:10.452 --> 01:08:13.015
What happened to make
you behave like this?

01:08:14.796 --> 01:08:17.188
Is it because you think
I don't need you?

01:08:19.772 --> 01:08:20.403
Yes.

01:08:20.428 --> 01:08:21.671
I don't.

01:08:22.328 --> 01:08:24.154
Why, that's very
predictable of you.

01:08:24.703 --> 01:08:26.151
Don't act so tough.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:27.479
I know you are not.

01:08:27.721 --> 01:08:29.152
Yeah, that's right,
that's right.

01:08:29.225 --> 01:08:30.634
If I don't protect myself,

01:08:30.782 --> 01:08:32.270
somebody will come
in the middle of the night

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:34.197
and take over my
corner of the room

01:08:34.251 --> 01:08:36.639
and ask me about their
fucking asparagus.

01:08:36.702 --> 01:08:37.982
Don't be a bully.
You're being a bully.

01:08:38.062 --> 01:08:39.591
There are other things
I'd like to do with my time.

01:08:39.617 --> 01:08:41.687
-It's my time. My time!
-I have no idea what I'm...

01:08:41.712 --> 01:08:43.124
doing here in your time.

01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:44.265
What am I doing here?

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:46.335
I'm standing around like
an idiot waiting for you.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:47.359
Waiting for what?

01:08:47.384 --> 01:08:49.913
-Waiting for you.
-Waiting for what?

01:08:50.792 --> 01:08:53.339
Waiting for you
to get rid of me.

01:08:54.549 --> 01:08:56.111
To tell me to leave.

01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.011
So, tell me.

01:08:58.161 --> 01:09:00.192
So I don't stand around like a

01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:01.345
fucking fool.

01:09:01.368 --> 01:09:03.345
Asparagus. Is this all
about your asparagus?

01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:04.571
No, it is not about asparagus.

01:09:04.634 --> 01:09:06.111
What the hell is it about?

01:09:06.212 --> 01:09:08.799
Are you a special agent sent
here to ruin my evening

01:09:08.823 --> 01:09:10.263
and possibly my entire life?

01:09:10.294 --> 01:09:11.504
Why are you so rude to me?

01:09:11.529 --> 01:09:12.951
Why are you talking
to me like this?

01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:13.988
Is this my house?

01:09:14.014 --> 01:09:15.551
-This is my house, isn't it?
-Yes, this is your house.

01:09:15.576 --> 01:09:17.044
-Is this my house?
-Of course, it's your house.

01:09:17.069 --> 01:09:18.716
Or did somebody drop me

01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:19.890
-on foreign soil
-What a question.

01:09:19.916 --> 01:09:20.961
behind enemy lines.

01:09:20.986 --> 01:09:22.694
-You brought me here.
-I'm surrounded on all sides.

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:24.140
It's you who brought me here.

01:09:24.242 --> 01:09:26.148
When the hell did this happen?
Who are you?

01:09:26.211 --> 01:09:27.406
Do you have a gun?

01:09:27.703 --> 01:09:29.062
You're here to kill me?

01:09:29.756 --> 01:09:31.491
-Hm, do you have a gun?
-Stop it!

01:09:31.711 --> 01:09:32.921
-Where's your gun?
-Stop being a child.

01:09:33.054 --> 01:09:34.412
-Where's your gun?
-Stop...

01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:35.694
-Show me your gun.
-playing.

01:09:35.787 --> 01:09:37.569
Stop playing this game.

01:09:37.857 --> 01:09:38.990
-I'm not playing a game.
-I'm not...

01:09:39.053 --> 01:09:39.935
Yes, mm-hmm.

01:09:40.014 --> 01:09:41.419
-Uh-huh.
-What game am I playing?

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.553
What game?

01:09:42.618 --> 01:09:44.915
What precisely is
the nature of my game?

01:09:44.991 --> 01:09:45.844
You tell me.

01:09:45.912 --> 01:09:47.430
Oh, this whole...

01:09:49.906 --> 01:09:50.697
What?

01:09:50.781 --> 01:09:52.984
All your rules and your walls

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:54.640
and your doors and your people

01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:55.687
and your

01:09:55.741 --> 01:09:58.237
money and all this clothes and

01:09:58.291 --> 01:10:00.752
everything! This! This!
This game!

01:10:00.806 --> 01:10:03.866
Everything here!
The whole pfff!

01:10:03.998 --> 01:10:06.920
Nothing is normal
or natural or...

01:10:07.116 --> 01:10:09.053
Everything is a game.

01:10:11.437 --> 01:10:12.984
"Yes, mister, no, madam".

01:10:13.039 --> 01:10:15.497
Yes, uh...vu-vu-poo.

01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:16.826
Well...

01:10:16.982 --> 01:10:18.684
i-if it's my...
-I don't eat this.

01:10:18.732 --> 01:10:20.404
-If it's my life...
-I don't drink that, I don't...

01:10:20.443 --> 01:10:22.107
that you're describing.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.043
It's entirely up to you whether
you choose to share it or not.

01:10:25.129 --> 01:10:26.584
If you don't wish
to share that life

01:10:26.609 --> 01:10:29.666
as apparently it's so disagreeable
to you in every respect,

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:32.556
why don't you just fuck off
to back where you came from?

01:10:53.577 --> 01:10:55.631
Sometimes it's good for him...

01:10:55.818 --> 01:10:57.897
to slow down his steps a little.

01:12:35.141 --> 01:12:37.461
Would you like me to
ask Alma to leave?

01:12:41.529 --> 01:12:43.154
No, why?

01:12:47.326 --> 01:12:49.568
Well, if you're going
to make her a ghost...

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.307
go ahead and do it, but

01:12:53.394 --> 01:12:55.808
please don't let her sit
around waiting for you.

01:12:56.878 --> 01:12:58.471
I'm very fond of her.

01:12:59.511 --> 01:13:01.489
Oh, you're very
fond of her, are you?

01:13:01.567 --> 01:13:03.301
Well, in that case...

01:13:08.487 --> 01:13:10.924
Well, don't turn it on me. I don't
want your cloud on my head.

01:13:10.949 --> 01:13:13.074
-Oh, shut up, Cyril.
-Oh, you can shut right up.

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.330
Don't pick a fight with me.

01:13:14.416 --> 01:13:16.465
You certainly won't
come out alive.

01:13:16.839 --> 01:13:17.691
I'll go right through you

01:13:17.762 --> 01:13:19.660
and it'd be you who
ends up on the floor.

01:13:19.707 --> 01:13:20.972
Understood?

01:14:26.455 --> 01:14:28.909
-Morning, Pippa.
-Morning, Sir.

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:36.542
Pen, book, and glasses?

01:14:36.604 --> 01:14:38.058
Yes, they're all
there for you, Sir.

01:14:38.643 --> 01:14:39.753
Morning, ladies.

01:14:39.877 --> 01:14:41.268
-Morning, Sir.
-Morning, Sir.

01:15:31.957 --> 01:15:34.575
Excellent work, ladies. Um...

01:15:41.044 --> 01:15:42.966
It's just not very good, is it?

01:15:45.744 --> 01:15:47.080
It's ugly.

01:15:55.581 --> 01:15:57.011
-Oh!
-Oh!

01:15:57.771 --> 01:15:59.146
You all right, Sir?

01:16:26.985 --> 01:16:28.297
Reynolds?

01:16:32.998 --> 01:16:34.435
Reynolds, are you all right?

01:16:38.499 --> 01:16:41.108
Mr. Woodcock,
he seems to be ill.

01:16:41.811 --> 01:16:42.967
Who seems to be ill?

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:46.211
Mr. Woodcock, he's fallen over
and he's damaged the dress!

01:16:47.569 --> 01:16:48.967
I-I'm sorry, Biddy?

01:16:49.142 --> 01:16:50.524
-Who's fallen over?
-Mr. Woodcock.

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:52.705
He's fallen over and
he's damaged the dress,

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:54.998
and there's stains on
the front of the skirt,

01:16:55.054 --> 01:16:57.810
and there's a hole, in the bo-
in the lace and the bodice,

01:16:57.896 --> 01:17:00.668
and there's shoe polish
on the front of the dress.

01:17:01.387 --> 01:17:02.934
Shoe polish from what?

01:17:03.766 --> 01:17:05.118
From his shoe.

01:17:06.565 --> 01:17:07.651
I'm fine.

01:17:08.534 --> 01:17:10.542
Oh, I don't know what
the hell came over me.

01:17:13.452 --> 01:17:15.155
Must be something I've eaten.

01:17:15.193 --> 01:17:16.272
Mm-hmm.

01:17:29.315 --> 01:17:32.127
-You should lie down.
-No, I'm fine.

01:17:34.524 --> 01:17:35.359
Please lie down.

01:17:35.399 --> 01:17:37.311
No, really, don't fuss,
Alma, please?

01:17:37.336 --> 01:17:39.602
-I...
-Just don't fuss, whatever it is.

01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:42.540
If you fuss,
I'll die right here.

01:17:44.609 --> 01:17:46.452
I promise, I won't fuss.

01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:53.554
Let me do that, please.

01:17:53.601 --> 01:17:55.054
I have to take these off.

01:17:55.124 --> 01:17:56.968
Yes, I'll take them.

01:18:17.469 --> 01:18:18.414
Alma?

01:18:18.836 --> 01:18:19.799
Alma?

01:18:19.994 --> 01:18:20.884
Yes?

01:18:21.119 --> 01:18:22.010
Um...

01:18:22.783 --> 01:18:25.471
Would you tell them
I'll be down shortly?

01:18:28.174 --> 01:18:29.408
Yes, of course.

01:19:27.241 --> 01:19:28.772
Hello, Cyril.

01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:30.139
Yes.

01:19:32.375 --> 01:19:33.468
What is it?

01:19:34.968 --> 01:19:37.421
I don't know what the
bloody hell came over me.

01:19:37.684 --> 01:19:39.192
I'll be all right in a moment.

01:19:39.879 --> 01:19:41.473
Well, you don't look all right.

01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:43.598
Where does it hurt?

01:19:44.637 --> 01:19:46.262
It's all over.

01:19:47.051 --> 01:19:49.090
Never really felt like this before.

01:19:49.773 --> 01:19:51.727
Is it your stomach?
Is it something you've eaten?

01:19:51.814 --> 01:19:53.265
No, I don't think so.

01:19:53.297 --> 01:19:54.555
I swore, it...

01:19:55.366 --> 01:19:57.506
So please tell them I'll
be with them in a minute.

01:19:57.660 --> 01:19:58.937
No, you're not going anywhere.

01:19:59.093 --> 01:20:00.640
Just stay here and rest.

01:20:02.203 --> 01:20:03.758
Would you like me
to do anything?

01:20:05.062 --> 01:20:06.547
Just give me silence.

01:20:08.284 --> 01:20:09.547
Shall I call the doctor?

01:20:09.624 --> 01:20:11.570
No, Cyril, you certainly
will not, please.

01:20:11.665 --> 01:20:12.688
All right.

01:20:12.963 --> 01:20:13.791
Um...

01:20:14.089 --> 01:20:16.026
-Exhausted yourself.
-Just give me silence.

01:20:16.073 --> 01:20:17.182
Burning up.

01:20:17.237 --> 01:20:18.520
Will you take care
of the dress for me?

01:20:18.545 --> 01:20:20.229
Yes, of course I will.
It's all right.

01:20:20.362 --> 01:20:21.222
Just...

01:20:22.011 --> 01:20:24.925
-I just want to...
-Shh, shh, shh.

01:20:27.370 --> 01:20:28.400
That's it.

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:29.948
Come on, Alma.

01:20:48.449 --> 01:20:50.253
I think I may be sick again.

01:20:55.641 --> 01:20:57.930
We're gonna have to do a lot
of work to get this dress

01:20:58.017 --> 01:20:59.759
ready for tomorrow, you know?

01:20:59.870 --> 01:21:02.174
We're gonna have to undo
the front of the dress,

01:21:02.244 --> 01:21:03.815
and replace the skirt.

01:21:03.932 --> 01:21:06.404
We're gonna have to cut a
new panel of the satin,

01:21:06.522 --> 01:21:08.041
and there's also the
organza piece...

01:21:08.136 --> 01:21:11.013
Yes, I'll deal with that in
a minute, Biddy, thank you.

01:21:52.347 --> 01:21:55.675
Yes, I've got to
change your pajamas.

01:22:03.269 --> 01:22:04.879
I'm scared, Alma.

01:22:08.137 --> 01:22:09.598
Yes, of course you are.

01:22:12.140 --> 01:22:14.210
Do you think I'll ever get better?

01:22:14.678 --> 01:22:15.725
Of course.

01:22:17.061 --> 01:22:18.569
I take care of you.

01:22:26.987 --> 01:22:28.643
Madame, there's a telephone call.

01:22:47.585 --> 01:22:50.515
He's...settled now, sleeping.

01:22:51.437 --> 01:22:54.148
-Doctor's here.
-What doctor?

01:22:54.999 --> 01:22:56.421
The doctor I sent for.

01:22:56.767 --> 01:22:59.642
-Oh, no, but he's...
-He needs to be examined.

01:23:00.001 --> 01:23:01.845
-No.
-Yes.

01:23:02.864 --> 01:23:04.309
No, he's not dying.

01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:06.239
He needs to be examined.

01:23:07.262 --> 01:23:09.120
He's sleeping now,
that's what he needs.

01:23:09.145 --> 01:23:10.512
Let me be unambiguous.

01:23:10.639 --> 01:23:13.395
Come out of the room and
downstairs immediately.

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:16.668
All right.

01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:30.129
Alma, this is Dr. Hardy.

01:23:30.269 --> 01:23:31.769
How do you do,
Mrs. Woodcock?

01:23:32.821 --> 01:23:34.875
How do you do?

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:36.383
How's he feeling?

01:23:36.430 --> 01:23:38.899
He's-He's better,
he's sleeping.

01:23:39.055 --> 01:23:41.172
Is he able to keep
anything down yet?

01:23:41.274 --> 01:23:45.063
He hasn't tried it. Uh, I was
going to make some soup.

01:23:45.362 --> 01:23:46.744
And his fever?

01:23:47.104 --> 01:23:48.620
It has gone down.

01:23:50.151 --> 01:23:51.511
Oh, would you like
me to see him?

01:23:51.643 --> 01:23:52.745
Yes.

01:23:52.948 --> 01:23:54.167
Is that all right, Mrs. Woodcock?

01:23:54.237 --> 01:23:55.542
Yes! It is.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:14.056
Reynolds, Lady Baltimore
sent her godson to see you.

01:24:14.276 --> 01:24:15.604
Dr. Hardy.

01:24:20.056 --> 01:24:21.603
Hello, Mr. Woodcock.

01:24:22.321 --> 01:24:23.657
May I examine you?

01:24:23.908 --> 01:24:25.455
Keep your hands off me.

01:24:26.290 --> 01:24:27.502
Well, I just like to
take your temperature.

01:24:27.527 --> 01:24:28.447
Alma?

01:24:28.556 --> 01:24:31.243
There's a strange boy in the room,
can you get him out, please?

01:24:31.377 --> 01:24:32.806
I admit, I do look young--

01:24:32.877 --> 01:24:34.228
Fuck off.

01:24:34.460 --> 01:24:36.367
Reynolds, please, just
let him examine you.

01:24:36.437 --> 01:24:37.969
Yes, fuck off.

01:24:39.437 --> 01:24:42.015
I think this is clear, hm?

01:24:42.234 --> 01:24:43.812
He wants you to fuck off.

01:24:46.479 --> 01:24:48.229
I'm so sorry, Doctor.

01:25:02.578 --> 01:25:03.812
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

01:25:04.039 --> 01:25:05.250
Not to worry.

01:25:05.416 --> 01:25:07.844
I'll drop by tomorrow morning
to see how he's coming along.

01:25:07.887 --> 01:25:08.879
Nine a.m.?

01:25:08.926 --> 01:25:09.957
-Yes.
-Yes.

01:25:09.982 --> 01:25:12.481
If his fever increases during
the night, you'll telephone me?

01:25:12.521 --> 01:25:13.902
-Of course, Doctor.
-Of course, Doctor.

01:25:14.067 --> 01:25:15.388
Good night, Mrs. Woodcock.

01:25:15.489 --> 01:25:17.099
-Good night, Doctor.
-Good night, Doctor.

01:25:30.103 --> 01:25:31.423
Follow me.

01:26:06.259 --> 01:26:07.580
When will it be ready?

01:26:08.329 --> 01:26:09.759
I don't know.

01:26:10.869 --> 01:26:12.220
Let me put it another way.

01:26:12.291 --> 01:26:14.234
This dress will be
ready by nine a.m.

01:26:14.259 --> 01:26:16.439
because that's when
it leaves for Belgium.

01:26:24.679 --> 01:26:26.310
Ladies, I'm very sorry,
but I'm afraid

01:26:26.404 --> 01:26:28.239
you'll have to work
late this evening.

01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:31.232
The dress needs to be
ready by nine a.m...

01:26:32.232 --> 01:26:34.223
to make its journey to Belgium.

01:26:34.474 --> 01:26:36.193
Do expect to be here...

01:26:36.685 --> 01:26:38.310
for quite some time.

01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:40.201
If you need to use
the telephone,

01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:41.883
please use the one in my office.

01:26:41.942 --> 01:26:44.954
Nana and Biddy,
what can I do to help?

01:26:45.052 --> 01:26:47.075
Could you pin the ribbon
on the hem there, please?

01:26:47.106 --> 01:26:48.138
Thank you.

01:26:48.208 --> 01:26:49.536
Ladies, I'm very sorry,
but I'm afraid

01:26:49.561 --> 01:26:51.341
you'll have to work
late this evening.

01:26:51.567 --> 01:26:53.522
The dress needs to be
ready by nine a.m...

01:26:53.547 --> 01:26:56.351
and I know there's rather
a lot to do on it, still.

01:26:56.429 --> 01:26:58.210
So, please, do expect
to be here...

01:26:58.262 --> 01:27:00.387
possibly for
the rest of the night.

01:27:00.457 --> 01:27:02.621
If you need to make
telephone calls,

01:27:02.646 --> 01:27:04.942
do so from my office.
Thank you.

01:28:32.444 --> 01:28:34.007
Are you here?

01:28:44.037 --> 01:28:45.826
Are you always here?

01:28:53.586 --> 01:28:54.843
I miss you.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:00.359
I think about you all the time.

01:29:05.153 --> 01:29:08.387
I hear your voice say
my name when I dream.

01:29:10.230 --> 01:29:11.543
And when I wake up,

01:29:11.606 --> 01:29:14.270
there are tears
streaming down my face.

01:29:21.197 --> 01:29:24.119
I just miss you.
It's as simple as that.

01:29:27.205 --> 01:29:29.166
I want to tell you everything.

01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:39.369
I don't understand
what you're saying.

01:29:43.963 --> 01:29:45.401
I can't hear your voice.

01:30:49.722 --> 01:30:51.363
Your fever's gone down.

01:32:38.263 --> 01:32:39.881
I love you, Alma.

01:32:42.365 --> 01:32:44.576
I don't ever want
to be without you.

01:32:50.175 --> 01:32:51.417
I love you.

01:32:55.424 --> 01:32:57.197
I have things I want to do.

01:32:59.807 --> 01:33:02.182
I thought my days
were unlimited.

01:33:03.877 --> 01:33:05.408
The mistakes I've made...

01:33:06.142 --> 01:33:07.494
I've made again.

01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:10.061
They can no longer be ignored.

01:33:10.765 --> 01:33:11.981
There are things nagging at me.

01:33:12.090 --> 01:33:14.264
Things that now must be done.

01:33:17.449 --> 01:33:19.770
Things I simply cannot
do without you.

01:33:23.494 --> 01:33:24.962
To keep my...

01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:32.181
sour heart from choking.

01:33:38.573 --> 01:33:40.049
To break a curse.

01:33:43.457 --> 01:33:45.972
A house that doesn't
change is a dead house.

01:33:53.410 --> 01:33:55.191
Alma, will you marry me?

01:34:07.128 --> 01:34:08.519
Will you marry me?

01:34:18.917 --> 01:34:21.190
What the bloody hell
are you thinking about?

01:34:22.582 --> 01:34:24.050
Will you marry me?

01:34:40.671 --> 01:34:41.819
No?

01:34:44.250 --> 01:34:45.343
Yes.

01:34:47.961 --> 01:34:49.438
Will you marry me?

01:34:49.624 --> 01:34:50.913
Yes, I will.

01:35:01.997 --> 01:35:03.179
Reynolds and Alma,

01:35:03.242 --> 01:35:05.734
when you say these binding
and contracting words,

01:35:05.832 --> 01:35:07.629
you'll be looking at each other

01:35:07.668 --> 01:35:10.449
after all, it is to each other
you're marrying, and not to me.

01:35:11.787 --> 01:35:13.162
Reynolds,

01:35:13.358 --> 01:35:15.615
I call upon these
persons here present...

01:35:16.301 --> 01:35:18.918
I call upon these
persons here present...

01:35:19.019 --> 01:35:21.887
to witness that I, Reynolds
Jeremiah Woodcock,

01:35:22.278 --> 01:35:26.266
to witness that I, Reynolds
Jeremiah Woodcock,

01:35:26.352 --> 01:35:28.571
do take thee, Alma Elson,

01:35:29.262 --> 01:35:31.926
do take thee, Alma Elson,

01:35:32.122 --> 01:35:34.235
to be my lawful wedded wife.

01:35:35.226 --> 01:35:37.484
to be my lawful wedded wife.

01:35:37.973 --> 01:35:41.536
Alma, I call upon these
persons here present...

01:35:42.007 --> 01:35:44.289
I call upon these
persons here present...

01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:46.446
<i>to witness that I, Alma Elson,</i>

01:35:46.742 --> 01:35:49.008
<i>to witness that I, Alma Elson,</i>

01:35:49.190 --> 01:35:51.432
<i>do take thee, Reynolds
Jeremiah Woodcock,</i>

01:35:51.925 --> 01:35:55.432
<i>do take thee, Reynolds
Jeremiah Woodcock,</i>

01:35:55.589 --> 01:35:57.174
<i>to be my lawful wedded husband.</i>

01:35:57.557 --> 01:35:59.885
<i>to be my lawful wedded husband.</i>

01:36:02.019 --> 01:36:04.195
<i>And it now gives me great
pleasure to say...</i>

01:36:04.367 --> 01:36:08.206
<i>Congratulations, you are now
 husband and wife.</i>

01:36:08.466 --> 01:36:10.546
<i>And you may kiss the bride.</i>

01:36:48.799 --> 01:36:50.198
Cuckoo.

01:36:52.705 --> 01:36:54.174
-See you later.
-See you later.

01:36:54.284 --> 01:36:55.503
Good time.

01:36:55.866 --> 01:36:56.975
You too.

01:36:58.312 --> 01:36:59.734
You too, have a good time.

01:38:00.233 --> 01:38:01.686
None for me, thank you.

01:38:08.014 --> 01:38:09.382
Dr. Hardy?

01:38:10.484 --> 01:38:12.117
-Dr. Hardy?
-Oh, hey.

01:38:12.178 --> 01:38:13.218
Oh, excuse me.

01:38:13.335 --> 01:38:15.656
Reynolds, do you
remember Dr. Hardy?

01:38:15.944 --> 01:38:17.827
Good evening,
Mr. and Mrs. Woodcock.

01:38:17.976 --> 01:38:18.992
Oh, hello.

01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:21.038
How do you do, Mr. Woodcock?
How are you feeling?

01:38:21.117 --> 01:38:23.843
I think we met in a puddle
of sweat, didn't we?

01:38:23.984 --> 01:38:25.038
Yes, that's right.

01:38:25.148 --> 01:38:27.107
I probably owe you an
apology of some kind.

01:38:27.146 --> 01:38:28.583
I seem to remember
barking at you.

01:38:28.654 --> 01:38:31.326
There's no need. I've been
laid siege by much worse.

01:38:31.524 --> 01:38:32.610
Oh, really?

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.469
You look very healthy.
How are you feeling?

01:38:35.992 --> 01:38:37.805
Didn’t I tell you to fuck off?

01:38:39.031 --> 01:38:40.469
Yes, yes, you did.

01:38:40.672 --> 01:38:42.922
Dinner is served, everybody.

01:38:44.266 --> 01:38:45.453
Come on.

01:38:48.078 --> 01:38:50.508
So that's your shifty-eyed godson.

01:38:50.801 --> 01:38:52.278
Shifty-eyed?

01:38:53.146 --> 01:38:54.826
He's got perfectly normal eyes.

01:38:56.166 --> 01:38:58.339
I'm rather left smattering
things in that story.

01:38:58.587 --> 01:38:59.572
Really?

01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:01.349
Thank you very much.

01:39:01.701 --> 01:39:03.138
It's fallen off me.

01:39:03.394 --> 01:39:05.016
Ooh, I'm so sorry.

01:39:05.095 --> 01:39:06.586
It's very hard
to tell sometimes.

01:39:07.306 --> 01:39:08.329
Um...

01:39:08.488 --> 01:39:10.254
Secrets nobody tells.

01:39:11.774 --> 01:39:17.048
Your wife has got that gorgeous
glow you get with a first marriage.

01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:18.813
How long will you be in for?

01:39:19.603 --> 01:39:22.798
It seems my godson's rather
enjoying that glow as well.

01:39:25.454 --> 01:39:27.587
So, what are your plans
for New Year's Eve?

01:39:28.702 --> 01:39:30.202
Oh, um...

01:39:30.616 --> 01:39:32.303
we don't have any.

01:39:34.014 --> 01:39:36.428
Well, you should come out to the
Chelsea House Club ball.

01:39:39.569 --> 01:39:40.889
I don't know what that is.

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:41.810
Well, it's not
something I'd suggest

01:39:41.850 --> 01:39:43.428
if I didn't think you'd
have a wonderful time.

01:39:43.467 --> 01:39:45.194
It's really something to be seen.

01:39:48.909 --> 01:39:50.925
I'll pass it on to my husband.

01:39:51.417 --> 01:39:53.034
But I think we'll stay in.

01:39:56.182 --> 01:39:57.651
Change your mind.

01:39:58.995 --> 01:40:00.596
We'll get him to
change his mind.

01:40:00.675 --> 01:40:02.323
Or whatever it takes.
Now, please come,

01:40:02.417 --> 01:40:04.315
I promise you the
time of your life.

01:40:08.284 --> 01:40:10.253
How do you know
how my life has been?

01:40:12.792 --> 01:40:14.042
I don't.

01:40:16.346 --> 01:40:17.479
You're right.

01:40:18.378 --> 01:40:21.432
I think this would be quite a
fine time if you'd like to come.

01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:25.656
She's barely looked at you
this evening, has she?

01:40:35.434 --> 01:40:37.754
I think they're well
and truly shaken now.

01:40:47.527 --> 01:40:49.262
What on Earth are you doing?

01:40:49.474 --> 01:40:50.701
I rolled a three.

01:40:50.826 --> 01:40:52.568
Yes, but that's the four pip.

01:40:52.701 --> 01:40:54.067
Go back to the bar
where you belong.

01:40:54.161 --> 01:40:55.576
Oh, sorry.

01:40:56.539 --> 01:40:58.523
Let's not start cheating
at this stage, Alma.

01:40:58.757 --> 01:41:00.687
I'm not cheating.
I don't need to cheat.

01:41:00.851 --> 01:41:01.687
Oh, good.

01:41:01.742 --> 01:41:04.296
You do need to be able to
count, on the other hand.

01:41:04.555 --> 01:41:07.320
Backgammon, by the way,
I get trouble the score

01:41:07.375 --> 01:41:09.890
because you haven't got any
checkers off the board.

01:41:10.084 --> 01:41:11.412
Mm.

01:41:11.826 --> 01:41:14.099
Pfff. Stupid game anyway.

01:41:14.200 --> 01:41:16.895
Well, maybe it seems stupid to you
now as you're currently losing,

01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:19.442
but I dare say,
if you were victorious,

01:41:19.552 --> 01:41:21.950
I'm confident that you'd see
it in a different light.

01:41:21.997 --> 01:41:23.974
Now, they need your chair
for my next opponent.

01:41:24.083 --> 01:41:25.138
Next.

01:41:26.942 --> 01:41:28.099
Me, please.

01:41:28.708 --> 01:41:29.802
What?

01:41:29.981 --> 01:41:31.880
What are you so cranky about?

01:41:32.891 --> 01:41:34.414
Have fun with your
next opponent.

01:41:34.485 --> 01:41:37.328
Well, I-I think I will. A lot
more than I did with you.

01:41:37.429 --> 01:41:40.867
Gosh, she's really
very rude, isn't she?

01:41:42.910 --> 01:41:44.653
My heart breaks for you.

01:41:44.755 --> 01:41:46.199
Oh, really?

01:41:46.903 --> 01:41:49.051
Being married to a toddler.

01:41:50.764 --> 01:41:53.100
I don't mean to be
racist, but, I mean...

01:41:53.293 --> 01:41:55.417
Is there some sort of custom
at this time of the night

01:41:55.480 --> 01:41:57.410
in her country where...

01:41:57.577 --> 01:41:59.155
-I mean, what's she doing?
-What's your point?

01:41:59.233 --> 01:42:00.218
I don't know...

01:42:00.295 --> 01:42:03.686
She's stealing things or
attacking people, I mean...

01:42:08.623 --> 01:42:10.147
I want to go dancing.

01:42:13.700 --> 01:42:14.935
When?

01:42:16.115 --> 01:42:17.294
Right now.

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:22.233
You're joking.

01:42:22.835 --> 01:42:24.131
No, I'm not.

01:42:25.538 --> 01:42:27.053
It's New Year's Eve.

01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:34.092
Well, I'm not going dancing.

01:42:38.530 --> 01:42:40.678
There's a party at
the Devonshire Hall

01:42:40.741 --> 01:42:42.530
to celebrate the New Year.

01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:45.046
And I want to go.

01:42:48.538 --> 01:42:50.124
We need to go dancing.

01:42:56.179 --> 01:42:58.170
So, what are you going
to do about it?

01:43:01.976 --> 01:43:03.944
I'm going to stay right here

01:43:04.030 --> 01:43:05.655
and I'm going to work.

01:44:58.841 --> 01:45:00.724
And now, ladies and gentlemen!

01:45:00.934 --> 01:45:05.372
Are you ready to welcome in
a glorious, lucky New Year?

01:45:06.661 --> 01:45:08.090
Are you ready?

01:45:08.902 --> 01:45:10.137
Here we go!

01:45:10.442 --> 01:45:14.976
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

01:45:15.139 --> 01:45:19.592
Five, four, three, two, one!

01:45:19.726 --> 01:45:21.390
Happy New Year!

01:47:21.215 --> 01:47:22.785
How does it feel?

01:47:22.972 --> 01:47:26.332
Well, I think it feels a little big.

01:47:26.739 --> 01:47:28.428
Should we just take
a little off the waist?

01:47:28.593 --> 01:47:30.819
-We can take a little off the waist.
-Yes.

01:47:47.358 --> 01:47:48.702
How's that feeling?

01:47:49.069 --> 01:47:50.522
I think that's better.

01:47:50.731 --> 01:47:53.723
Would you excuse me for a
minute please, Mrs. Vaughan?

01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:59.576
I think it's...

01:48:02.054 --> 01:48:03.687
It's not too tight?

01:48:04.190 --> 01:48:06.487
No, it's comfortable. Fine.

01:48:27.050 --> 01:48:29.261
Where has
Henrietta Harding been?

01:48:41.142 --> 01:48:42.587
She's been to another house.

01:48:42.711 --> 01:48:44.016
Which one?

01:48:52.749 --> 01:48:54.116
Why didn't you tell me?

01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:55.842
Because I didn't want to.

01:49:02.674 --> 01:49:03.987
Is there something
that I'm unaware of?

01:49:04.034 --> 01:49:05.737
Because as far as
I can remember,

01:49:05.854 --> 01:49:08.261
all I have done is to
dress her beautifully.

01:49:08.461 --> 01:49:11.024
I don't think that
matters to some people.

01:49:12.274 --> 01:49:15.250
I think they want what
is fashionable and chic.

01:49:15.703 --> 01:49:16.711
Chic?

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.086
Oh, don't you start using that
filthy little word. Chic?

01:49:20.456 --> 01:49:22.659
Whoever invented that ought
to be spanked in public.

01:49:22.684 --> 01:49:25.128
I don't-I don't even know
what that word means.

01:49:25.198 --> 01:49:27.073
What is that word? Fucking chic?

01:49:27.415 --> 01:49:29.688
They should be hung, drawn
and quartered. Fucking chic.

01:49:29.742 --> 01:49:30.969
It shouldn't concern you.

01:49:31.001 --> 01:49:32.899
It does concern me. It
concerns me very much, Cyril

01:49:32.945 --> 01:49:35.048
because it's hurt my feelings.

01:49:35.368 --> 01:49:37.579
It's hurt my feelings.

01:49:45.368 --> 01:49:47.454
So, what's all this
moaning about?

01:49:50.490 --> 01:49:51.935
I am not moaning.

01:49:52.693 --> 01:49:55.255
I do not like to be
turned away from.

01:49:55.925 --> 01:49:57.159
Nobody does.

01:49:58.425 --> 01:50:01.644
But I don't want to hear it
because it hurts my ears.

01:50:20.388 --> 01:50:23.318
I've made a terrible mistake in
my life, Cyril. I've made a--

01:50:25.491 --> 01:50:27.390
I made a terrible mistake.

01:50:27.655 --> 01:50:29.116
I need you to help me.

01:50:33.965 --> 01:50:35.691
What do you want me to do?

01:50:44.648 --> 01:50:46.273
I can't work. I can't...

01:50:47.015 --> 01:50:48.382
concentrate.

01:50:49.460 --> 01:50:51.359
I have no confidence.

01:50:52.573 --> 01:50:55.315
She does not fit in this house.

01:50:57.581 --> 01:50:59.284
We built this house.

01:50:59.464 --> 01:51:00.667
The two of us.

01:51:00.799 --> 01:51:02.831
Now she's turning the whole
bloody place upside down.

01:51:02.885 --> 01:51:04.419
She's turning me inside-out.

01:51:04.607 --> 01:51:06.842
She's turning you and
me against each other.

01:51:07.293 --> 01:51:11.310
Her arrival has cast a
very long shadow, Cyril.

01:51:15.905 --> 01:51:18.272
Mrs. Vaughan is satisfied
with the dress.

01:51:18.331 --> 01:51:20.643
No one gives a
tinker's fucking curse

01:51:20.737 --> 01:51:23.416
about Mrs. Vaughan's
satisfaction!

01:51:28.135 --> 01:51:29.510
Thank you, Alma.

01:51:32.807 --> 01:51:34.057
Not at all.

01:51:41.102 --> 01:51:43.962
What a model of
politeness you two are.

01:51:51.016 --> 01:51:54.345
There is an air of
quiet death in this house.

01:51:54.930 --> 01:51:57.508
And I do not like
the way it smells.

01:55:49.909 --> 01:55:51.557
Would you like a glass of wine?

01:55:51.971 --> 01:55:53.088
No, thank you.

01:55:54.674 --> 01:55:56.401
Can I make you a martini?

01:55:56.986 --> 01:55:58.737
Nothing for me, thanks.

01:56:03.838 --> 01:56:05.198
Water?

01:58:27.990 --> 01:58:29.170
I want you...

01:58:29.849 --> 01:58:31.397
flat on your back...

01:58:36.139 --> 01:58:37.131
helpless...

01:58:39.014 --> 01:58:40.107
tender...

01:58:42.185 --> 01:58:43.106
open...

01:58:45.771 --> 01:58:47.372
with only me to help.

01:58:54.007 --> 01:58:55.999
And then I want
you strong again.

01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:03.976
You're not going to die.

01:59:06.317 --> 01:59:09.871
You might wish you're going to
die, but you're not going to.

01:59:14.174 --> 01:59:16.127
You need to settle
down a little.

01:59:35.681 --> 01:59:38.681
Kiss me, my girl,
before I'm sick.

02:00:00.505 --> 02:00:01.747
I think perhaps...

02:00:02.825 --> 02:00:04.512
you should telephone that...

02:00:04.990 --> 02:00:07.888
boy doctor of yours,
just in case.

02:00:09.631 --> 02:00:11.037
You don't trust me?

02:00:12.635 --> 02:00:14.846
No, I do trust you, it's just...

02:00:22.474 --> 02:00:23.568
If you wish.

02:00:24.764 --> 02:00:26.786
But I will make you well again.

02:00:32.576 --> 02:00:33.717
I will.

02:00:36.374 --> 02:00:37.717
I love you.

02:00:38.350 --> 02:00:39.850
I love you, too.

02:00:42.694 --> 02:00:45.272
And I think perhaps
you should leave the room.

02:00:48.736 --> 02:00:51.111
-Close the door behind you.
-Yes.

02:00:52.284 --> 02:00:53.659
I'll be right outside.

02:00:58.851 --> 02:01:00.922
<i>If he didn't wake up from this,</i>

02:01:02.711 --> 02:01:04.530
<i>if he wasn't here tomorrow...</i>

02:01:05.984 --> 02:01:07.390
<i>no matter.</i>

02:01:08.054 --> 02:01:10.273
For I know he'd be
waiting for me...

02:01:10.789 --> 02:01:12.226
in the afterlife...

02:01:13.250 --> 02:01:15.727
or some safe celestial place.

02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:18.525
In this life...

02:01:19.002 --> 02:01:20.392
and the next...

02:01:20.666 --> 02:01:22.572
and the next one after.

02:01:23.616 --> 02:01:27.374
<i>And for whatever there is on
the road that follows from here.</i>

02:01:27.655 --> 02:01:30.194
<i>It would only require
my patience...</i>

02:01:30.444 --> 02:01:32.093
<i>to get to him again.</i>

02:01:33.686 --> 02:01:35.194
You see...

02:01:35.631 --> 02:01:38.654
to be in love with him makes
life no great mystery.

02:01:40.807 --> 02:01:42.737
-Say ah.
-Ah.

02:01:48.633 --> 02:01:49.992
Very good.

02:01:58.961 --> 02:02:02.039
<i>Sometimes I jump ahead
in our life together.</i>

02:02:04.829 --> 02:02:07.477
<i>And I see a time near the end.</i>

02:02:09.266 --> 02:02:12.704
<i>I can predict the future
and everything has settled.</i>

02:02:13.625 --> 02:02:15.726
<i>And all our lovers and...</i>

02:02:16.781 --> 02:02:19.836
<i>children and friends come back...</i>

02:02:19.965 --> 02:02:21.926
<i>and are welcome.</i>

02:02:22.874 --> 02:02:28.163
<i>And we have large gatherings
where everyone is laughing and...</i>

02:02:28.797 --> 02:02:31.023
<i>playing games.</i>

02:02:39.031 --> 02:02:42.046
<i>I am older and
I see things differently.</i>

02:02:43.218 --> 02:02:45.640
<i>And I finally understand you.</i>

02:02:51.357 --> 02:02:53.778
<i>And I take care
of your dresses.</i>

02:02:55.466 --> 02:02:57.544
<i>Keeping them from dust and...</i>

02:02:57.927 --> 02:03:00.200
<i>ghosts and time.</i>

02:03:23.857 --> 02:03:26.450
Yes, but right now, we're here.

02:03:28.023 --> 02:03:29.945
Yes, of course we are.

02:03:33.533 --> 02:03:35.721
And I'm getting hungry.
