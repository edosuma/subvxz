WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:01.960
Previously on "The 100"...

00:02.378 --> 00:03.252
Where's Finn?

00:03.462 --> 00:04.629
Looking for you.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.756
Where is the girl
who was wearing this watch?

00:06.966 --> 00:10.259
Their clothes are here.
They were here!

00:10.469 --> 00:15.014
You slaughtered my people.
Elders. Children.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.182
Innocents.

00:17.977 --> 00:20.269
The massacre
must be answered.

00:20.479 --> 00:22.397
Blood must have blood.

00:22.606 --> 00:25.191
And as we speak,
they are marching on this camp.

00:25.401 --> 00:26.651
They're not
attacking yet,

00:26.860 --> 00:28.611
which means
we still have time.

00:28.821 --> 00:30.989
Deliver me the one
you call Finn.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.408
Our truce begins
with his death.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.448
Hold your fire!
She's back!

01:13.657 --> 01:14.949
Open the gate.

01:15.159 --> 01:17.285
Power up the gates.
Roll-out positions.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.745
Stay ready!

01:27.921 --> 01:29.088
You OK?

01:29.298 --> 01:30.173
Shut the gate.

01:33.177 --> 01:34.427
You can't be
out here.

01:52.780 --> 01:53.696
What did
she say?

01:56.533 --> 01:57.867
Is there a chance
for a truce?

02:01.705 --> 02:03.414
Yes.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.665
What's wrong?

02:06.835 --> 02:09.128
They want you.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.546
If we want
a truce,

02:10.756 --> 02:11.756
we have to give
them Finn.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.552
What the hell
are you talking about?

02:16.762 --> 02:18.429
That's their
offer.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.806
That's not
an offer.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.016
It's punishment.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.643
For what happened
at the village.

02:24.770 --> 02:25.853
Blood for blood.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.730
That's insane.

02:27.940 --> 02:28.981
If we refuse?

02:30.901 --> 02:32.485
They attack.

02:32.694 --> 02:33.736
Say we give him up!

02:33.946 --> 02:35.696
Get rid of him.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.240
Easy, people.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.492
Give him to
the grounders.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.577
Back off!

02:41.787 --> 02:45.039
Hey, raven, raven.
Raven, listen to me.

02:45.249 --> 02:46.791
Nothing is gonna
happen to him.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.877
I promise, OK?

02:50.963 --> 02:52.964
I'm not dying for him.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.633
Spacewalker burned 3 months
of oxygen on the ark.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.677
He should've floated
a long time ago.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.637
Throw him out!

02:59.847 --> 03:00.763
Back off!

03:00.973 --> 03:01.848
Stop, raven!

03:06.562 --> 03:07.520
Let me go.

03:07.729 --> 03:08.813
It's not
the only option.

03:52.274 --> 03:55.359
External airlock pressure tolerances
can be adjusted--

03:55.569 --> 03:56.777
at the manual
feed stem.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.321
Ask me a hard one.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.990
You've answered
all of these, like, 10 times.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.491
I have to go over
this stuff.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.202
You're running
fluid dynamic specs

04:04.411 --> 04:05.328
while we're
having sex.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.705
I think you've
been over it.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.040
Multitasking.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.710
So, what do you
want to do for your birthday?

04:15.172 --> 04:16.505
Honestly...

04:20.010 --> 04:21.469
I just want
to pass.

04:27.351 --> 04:28.434
That's it?

04:30.520 --> 04:32.647
Move up to zero-g

04:32.856 --> 04:34.315
so I don't have to spend
the rest of my life

04:34.524 --> 04:35.775
trapped inside this
tin can?

04:38.070 --> 04:40.905
That'd be enough.
Yeah.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.035
Well, I got you something.
Made it, actually.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.078
Mm.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.090
It's a raven.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.800
I thought it might
bring you luck.

05:01.009 --> 05:01.884
For your test.

05:03.762 --> 05:04.679
Do you like it?

05:18.193 --> 05:19.151
Hey, man.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.365
Byrne actually
gave me a gun.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.825
I guess we really
are screwed, huh?

05:29.538 --> 05:30.955
Look, we kicked
their asses last time.

05:30.956 --> 05:31.914
We'll do it again.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.333
A lot of people
died last time.

05:36.670 --> 05:39.588
Hey. We're reinforcing
all defenses.

05:39.798 --> 05:40.756
Doubles on
the perimeter.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.091
No one's getting
past that wire.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.261
I'll see where
they're thin.

05:45.470 --> 05:46.804
No. You should
head inside.

05:47.014 --> 05:48.639
B corridor
will be easier to defend

05:48.849 --> 05:49.849
if it comes
to that.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.475
I'm not gonna hide.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.853
Right now, we have
to think about keeping you safe.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.896
I'm gonna talk
to Lincoln.

05:56.106 --> 05:56.939
Come on.

05:58.650 --> 05:59.650
Finn.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.573
Hey. Any orders
for me, princess?

06:07.743 --> 06:08.784
Stay away from me.

06:10.787 --> 06:12.371
Just trying
to be helpful.

06:17.002 --> 06:18.794
You were with him
at the village.

06:19.004 --> 06:21.213
I tried to stop him.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.799
Not hard enough.

06:24.009 --> 06:26.135
You know, you want
to start blaming people, Clarke?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.598
He was out there
looking for you.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.027
Hang on.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.072
He's not a reaper
anymore.

06:46.281 --> 06:48.199
He doesn't need
to be restrained.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.492
Yes, I do.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.665
Just tell us.
Is there a way to make peace?

06:58.001 --> 06:59.752
Did she leave
riders behind?

06:59.961 --> 07:01.253
Two just outside
the gate.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.298
They're waiting
for Finn.

07:04.508 --> 07:06.258
You don't have much
time to decide.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.968
She can't expect us
to just

07:08.178 --> 07:09.929
hand over one of
our own people.

07:10.138 --> 07:11.472
- Would she do that?
- She wouldn't let

07:11.681 --> 07:13.599
the rest of her people die
to protect a murderer.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.685
If you don't do this,
she will kill

07:16.895 --> 07:18.771
everyone in this camp.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.148
There has to be something else
that we can offer.

07:21.358 --> 07:24.485
Finn took 18 lives.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.861
The commander's
offering to take

07:26.071 --> 07:27.071
just one in return.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.073
- Take the deal.
- How can you say that?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.076
Finn was the first
person to come to you

07:32.285 --> 07:33.285
to offer peace.

07:33.495 --> 07:34.412
He's your friend.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.497
He massacred
my village.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.165
Some of the dead were
my friends, too.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.417
But that
wasn't Finn.

07:39.626 --> 07:40.918
You know that's
not who he is.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.295
It is now.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.589
We've all got a monster inside
of us, Clarke,

07:45.799 --> 07:47.466
and we're all
responsible for what it does

07:47.676 --> 07:48.551
when we let it out.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.221
What will they do to him?

07:52.431 --> 07:54.306
Fire.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.433
Because he killed
the innocent,

07:55.642 --> 07:56.642
it starts with fire.

07:56.852 --> 07:57.810
Starts?

07:59.229 --> 08:00.354
They'll take his hands.

08:02.399 --> 08:04.942
His tongue, his eyes.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.112
And anyone who grieves will
have a turn with the knife.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.448
At sunrise, the commander
will end it with her sword.

08:12.826 --> 08:16.078
But I've never known anyone
to survive until the sword.

08:16.288 --> 08:21.584
He killed 18, he will suffer
the pain of 18 deaths.

08:21.793 --> 08:22.960
Then we can have peace.

08:31.928 --> 08:34.346
Abby. Let me out of
here, please.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.015
It was stupid.
I'm sorry.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.433
I don't want
to hear it.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.226
He was ready to throw
Finn out the gate.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.103
And you think I would
let that happen?

08:43.148 --> 08:44.273
I don't know.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.569
No.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.446
The only way we're
gonna make it through this

08:50.655 --> 08:52.740
is if we trust
each other.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.033
I'm trying.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.162
She's free to go.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.166
If you do anything
like that again,

09:02.375 --> 09:04.251
you will be back here
and you will stay here.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.586
Do you understand me?

09:10.717 --> 09:14.470
Don't be too hard on her.
She's a fighter.

09:14.679 --> 09:15.596
We need fighters.

09:15.805 --> 09:16.722
We need to find
a way out of this

09:16.932 --> 09:17.973
without fighting.

09:18.183 --> 09:21.101
There is a way,
and you know what it is.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.103
No. It's not
an option.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.230
We need
to consider it.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.232
I said no.
I am not sending

09:26.441 --> 09:27.358
a child
to his death.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.361
We sent 100 of them
to the ground.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.198
That was another time
and another chancellor.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.124
Finn?

09:47.754 --> 09:48.963
Bellamy told me
you were here.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.967
What are
you doing?

09:53.176 --> 09:54.385
I have to go.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.346
Where? There's
nowhere to go.

09:57.556 --> 10:00.057
I'm putting everyone
in this camp in danger.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.809
There are grounders
everywhere, Finn.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.477
They'll kill you.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.020
Maybe that's
what I deserve.

10:07.649 --> 10:08.941
For what I've done.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.318
You were trying
to find our people.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.487
Trying to save us.

10:13.697 --> 10:15.614
I was trying
to save you.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.367
Clarke...

10:18.577 --> 10:20.202
- Finn--
- I'm in love with you.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.707
Everything that's
happened,

10:24.916 --> 10:25.958
everything I've done.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.297
All that matters
is that you're OK.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.844
That you forgive me.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.600
Say something.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.272
Don't leave.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.193
Please.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.286
What is that?

11:15.175 --> 11:16.216
This is it.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.384
We have to
get you inside.

11:41.409 --> 11:42.826
They're trying
to scare us.

11:45.747 --> 11:46.747
I think we
should pull back

11:46.956 --> 11:48.374
and go inside
the station.

11:48.583 --> 11:50.876
No. We need to prove
we're not afraid.

11:51.086 --> 11:51.919
What if I am?

11:53.713 --> 11:54.630
Fake it.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.268
Open the gate.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.275
Where's the boy?

12:15.485 --> 12:16.985
We're not
giving him up.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.821
We're ready
to fight,

12:19.030 --> 12:20.572
if that's what
it comes to.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.040
Huh, hyah, hyah!

12:31.668 --> 12:33.877
Watch the woods!
Watch for movement!

12:38.174 --> 12:39.091
Bellamy.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.052
Movement on the tree line!

12:43.346 --> 12:44.430
Don't shoot!

12:46.099 --> 12:47.266
Don't shoot!

12:57.277 --> 12:58.193
Marcus.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.821
Chancellor.

13:01.030 --> 13:02.906
I was afraid that I wouldn't
see you again.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.409
I had those
fears myself.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.913
It's good to see
this place again.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.790
Can't be out
in the open.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.208
We need to get
somewhere safe.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.170
It's safe
for the moment.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.465
Come on.
We need to talk.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.175
I managed to buy us
a bit of time.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.260
All right, close it up!
Let's go!

13:26.931 --> 13:29.057
Where did they
keep you?

13:29.267 --> 13:31.769
Uh, the commander's
stronghold, I think.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.896
I wasn't
a prisoner, but

13:34.105 --> 13:36.398
I wasn't allowed
outside, either.

13:36.608 --> 13:37.816
Until they brought me
up here last night

13:38.026 --> 13:39.193
with a bag
over my head.

13:46.743 --> 13:48.994
What is this?
What's going on?

13:49.204 --> 13:50.204
Apparently,
the chancellor thinks

13:50.413 --> 13:51.872
I'm a very
dangerous man.

13:52.081 --> 13:52.831
Wait outside.

13:53.041 --> 13:53.916
Yes, ma'am.

13:54.125 --> 13:55.083
The former
chancellor

13:55.293 --> 13:56.794
is being detained
for treason.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.134
No offense, Marcus,
but I'm keeping the job

14:04.344 --> 14:05.511
until this is over.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.429
I would advise you
not to fight her on this.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.599
You bought us
time how?

14:12.685 --> 14:13.894
I've gotten to know
the commander

14:14.103 --> 14:15.479
and I believe...

14:15.688 --> 14:17.523
She'd be open to
the right proposal.

14:17.732 --> 14:19.024
What kind
of proposal?

14:19.234 --> 14:21.401
We offer to put
the boy on trial ourselves.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.695
Here. For war crimes.

14:23.905 --> 14:24.863
War crimes?

14:25.073 --> 14:27.074
Abby, if we put him
on trial,

14:27.283 --> 14:29.910
at least we will have
control over the process

14:30.119 --> 14:31.370
and his treatment.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.539
So, instead of
letting the grounders kill Finn,

14:33.748 --> 14:36.291
we would execute
him ourselves?

14:36.501 --> 14:37.876
That's a strong
possibility.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.926
Abby, I know
this is hard.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.095
But given
what we know,

14:48.304 --> 14:51.974
given the ferocity
of grounder justice,

14:52.183 --> 14:53.392
this could be
the most merciful

14:53.601 --> 14:54.434
outcome for the boy.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.233
You still want the job?

15:04.737 --> 15:05.946
What's happening?

15:06.155 --> 15:06.989
You were in there
a long time.

15:07.198 --> 15:07.906
There was a lot
to talk about.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.032
Well, what's
going on?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.576
There was a lot
to talk about.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.995
Hey. We are not turning him
over to the grounders.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.371
Step aside now.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.752
We're all trying
to find a way out of this.

15:27.302 --> 15:28.385
They're gonna
give him up.

15:35.768 --> 15:39.521
All fighters being
deployed, move to section 5.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.900
All fighters being deployed,
move to section 5.

15:44.402 --> 15:47.446
Hey. What's up?

15:47.655 --> 15:48.655
Happy Birthday.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.324
Yeah. Sorry
about that.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.825
I know we had
a plan.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.452
The team got
jammed up.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.203
Maybe I'll
see you later?

15:55.413 --> 15:56.538
Did they post
the scores?

15:59.667 --> 16:01.460
Aced it.

16:01.669 --> 16:02.669
The first
perfect score

16:02.879 --> 16:05.130
since they've
been giving the test.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.757
So, when's your
first spacewalk?

16:09.677 --> 16:10.844
That'd be never.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.012
What?

16:12.221 --> 16:14.473
I failed the physical.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.475
Some kind of
heart murmur.

16:16.684 --> 16:19.102
It's like a trillion to
one I'd ever feel it,

16:19.312 --> 16:20.854
but they don't want to
waste the training on me

16:21.064 --> 16:23.148
in case I might
kick it, so...

16:23.358 --> 16:24.316
I'm out.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.322
Happy Birthday.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.286
Finn.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.580
You need to get
out of here.

16:38.790 --> 16:39.623
Where would
he go?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.500
The dropship.

16:41.709 --> 16:43.335
No! You know that this is the
safest place for him right now.

16:43.544 --> 16:44.586
It isn't if they're
turning on him.

16:44.796 --> 16:45.921
We can protect him
at the dropship

16:46.130 --> 16:47.339
until we figure
this thing out.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.007
Grab your gear and meet at
raven's gate in 5.

16:49.217 --> 16:50.175
She's already
working on cutting

16:50.385 --> 16:51.301
the power
to the fence.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.803
OK, but nobody's
coming with me.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.429
That isn't up
for discussion.

16:54.639 --> 16:55.973
We are surrounded
by grounders.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.391
If we split up,
we take the low ground,

16:57.600 --> 16:59.309
we'll make it
through.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.019
We'll meet at
the dropship.

17:01.229 --> 17:02.688
There he is.

17:02.897 --> 17:04.147
You are gonna
get us killed.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.569
Anyone else?

17:09.779 --> 17:11.780
Bellamy's right.
We have to go.

17:28.589 --> 17:30.424
I thought we were
meeting in the mess.

17:30.633 --> 17:31.633
I thought this
would be better

17:31.843 --> 17:32.718
on an empty stomach.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.179
Happy Birthday.

17:36.389 --> 17:37.889
Uh, you're a week
and a half late,

17:38.099 --> 17:39.558
and you've already
given me something.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.851
Open it.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.441
Do you like it?

17:47.650 --> 17:50.068
It's a piece of
tape with my name on it.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.236
It goes with this.

17:55.366 --> 17:58.201
I borrowed it from
the maintenance bay.

17:58.411 --> 18:01.204
There's external repairs scheduled
all month.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.789
The crew
knocked off at 6

18:03.041 --> 18:04.458
and no one in
monitoring will be

18:04.667 --> 18:05.834
paying attention
to an open airlock

18:06.044 --> 18:07.085
in that section.

18:07.295 --> 18:08.086
No one will
ever know.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.967
So, you want to go
for a walk?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.349
Decom sequence complete.

18:21.559 --> 18:22.476
Is that everything?

18:22.685 --> 18:24.394
Purge recycle tanks.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.354
Uh, open
the refresh valve.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.363
OK. Done.

18:43.706 --> 18:44.581
Here we go.

18:58.346 --> 18:59.346
Have fun.

19:27.125 --> 19:28.708
The commander
accepted this agreement?

19:28.918 --> 19:30.585
We haven't made
the proposal yet.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.504
But I think she'll be willing
to consider it.

19:32.713 --> 19:35.090
I need to know.
If we put Finn on trial ourselves,

19:35.299 --> 19:37.759
is your commander
going to accept the outcome,

19:37.969 --> 19:40.137
even if we decide
he belongs in jail?

19:40.346 --> 19:42.222
Even if she wanted
to accept this deal,

19:42.431 --> 19:43.223
she'd be dead
by morning.

19:43.432 --> 19:44.599
She'd know that.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.101
Your people would
kill their own leader

19:46.310 --> 19:47.144
for being merciful?

19:47.353 --> 19:48.311
For being weak.

19:49.647 --> 19:52.065
Finn killed
innocent people.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.776
If death has no cost,
life has no worth.

19:54.986 --> 19:56.403
That's how we live.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.989
I spent time
with your commander.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.616
She's a visionary.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.286
And that's why you're
all still alive.

20:04.495 --> 20:06.580
If it were up to some at her table,
you wouldn't be.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.124
- Indra?
- She leads those voices, yes.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.667
She's dangerous, Abby.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.252
If she's the one
that's standing

20:12.461 --> 20:14.254
in the way of
an agreement,

20:14.463 --> 20:16.006
I need to speak to her
face to face.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.591
There's nothing
you can say.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.426
Maybe not.
But I can show her

20:19.635 --> 20:20.802
we understand
her pain.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.180
Maybe that
will be enough.

20:38.529 --> 20:42.157
Hey. You see
anything?

20:42.366 --> 20:44.201
I thought we were
splitting up.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.243
Not a chance.

20:48.623 --> 20:50.165
What do we do
after the dropship?

20:50.374 --> 20:51.208
Where do we go?

20:52.877 --> 20:54.044
You think the grounders
will just leave

20:54.212 --> 20:55.212
when they find out
I'm gone?

20:58.674 --> 20:59.758
Is this the
best way to help

20:59.967 --> 21:01.259
our friends inside
Mount Weather?

21:02.386 --> 21:04.179
We will figure
this out.

21:04.388 --> 21:05.222
Rawr!

21:05.431 --> 21:06.348
Look out!

21:19.195 --> 21:21.238
I don't want
to shoot you.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.115
Go!
Get out of here!

21:45.721 --> 21:46.930
I checked again.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.223
Still no sign
of them.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.102
Where are they?

21:52.311 --> 21:53.478
We shouldn't have
split up.

21:56.565 --> 21:57.732
Someone's coming.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.572
Ooh, hey, hey, hey.

22:04.782 --> 22:05.615
Murphy.

22:07.702 --> 22:08.660
What are you
doing here?

22:10.079 --> 22:11.705
I believe
I was invited.

22:11.914 --> 22:13.123
I thought we could
use an extra gun.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.710
Might be
a good idea.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.628
Finn should've
been right behind you.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.339
Don't worry.
The Spacewalker's gonna be fine.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.485
This is ark station

22:42.653 --> 22:43.820
calling birthday girl.

22:46.115 --> 22:49.576
You're hitting Eva Max.
Time to come back inside.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.249
Are you reading, birthday girl?

22:56.459 --> 22:58.293
Received, ark station.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.090
On my way.

23:16.270 --> 23:17.312
Closing the outer doors.

23:33.371 --> 23:34.579
Ahh.

23:34.789 --> 23:35.622
How was that?

23:38.626 --> 23:40.085
Free.

23:44.215 --> 23:45.882
Warning.
Outer door breached.

23:46.092 --> 23:49.719
Airlock pressure failing.
Initiate emergency protocol.

23:50.846 --> 23:51.888
What happened?

23:53.808 --> 23:54.974
Finn?

23:55.184 --> 23:56.309
I don't know!

24:03.109 --> 24:04.526
What happened?

24:04.735 --> 24:06.069
A grounder hit her
on the head.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.821
Put her here.

24:08.030 --> 24:09.823
I need a bandage.
A rag. Anything.

24:10.032 --> 24:11.699
Got it.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.243
Here.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.577
Hold her head.

24:16.497 --> 24:18.248
Clarke,
can you hear me?

24:22.837 --> 24:23.670
Clarke.

24:27.758 --> 24:31.469
You're gonna be fine.
You just need to rest.

24:31.679 --> 24:35.098
Hey. It's just
a bump on the head.

24:35.307 --> 24:36.391
Clarke's gonna be OK.

24:38.686 --> 24:39.561
Are you?

24:42.690 --> 24:44.149
We'll figure this out.

24:44.358 --> 24:45.483
That's what she said.

24:45.693 --> 24:46.943
Right before I almost
got her killed.

25:03.252 --> 25:04.711
Why have you come,

25:04.920 --> 25:06.838
leader of the sky people?

25:07.047 --> 25:09.424
To talk.
Leader to leader.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.761
We've both seen
too many of our people die.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.936
No. You came to lie.

25:22.146 --> 25:24.647
We have seen your
killer in the forest.

25:24.857 --> 25:25.982
You ordered him to run,

25:26.192 --> 25:28.026
and then you came here
to distract us.

25:28.235 --> 25:31.404
I'm just trying to keep
my people alive.

25:31.614 --> 25:32.780
Same as you.

25:32.990 --> 25:36.242
You told our riders
you were ready to fight.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.203
If we don't find
the boy soon,

25:38.412 --> 25:39.579
you'll get to prove that.

25:41.832 --> 25:44.876
You kill one of ours,
we kill two of yours.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.461
That only helps
the Mountain men.

25:48.589 --> 25:51.716
There has to be a way
to end this without bloodshed.

25:58.766 --> 25:59.933
You have courage...

26:01.602 --> 26:03.770
But courage
isn't justice.

26:06.774 --> 26:09.484
Only the boy can die
for what the boy has done.

26:30.673 --> 26:31.881
Still nothing?

26:33.217 --> 26:34.509
Just give her
a little time.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.227
I never meant
to hurt you.

26:48.899 --> 26:49.774
I know.

26:53.237 --> 26:54.988
Truth is,
things change.

26:56.991 --> 26:58.366
Maybe that's
for the best.

26:59.702 --> 27:01.536
Don't let me off
the hook so easy.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.668
We'll always
be family.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.129
Always.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.053
Hey.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.932
Told you
she'd be OK.

27:27.396 --> 27:28.855
Ahh.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.277
How's your head?

27:35.821 --> 27:36.738
Awesome.

27:38.949 --> 27:42.493
When you went down...
I thought you were dead.

27:45.706 --> 27:46.914
Because of me.

27:48.375 --> 27:49.334
I'm right here.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.423
I've killed
so many people.

27:55.633 --> 27:59.510
Finn, the things that
we've done to survive...

28:01.889 --> 28:03.056
They don't define us.

28:04.391 --> 28:05.516
What if
you're wrong?

28:06.727 --> 28:08.353
What if this is
who we are now?

28:13.275 --> 28:15.485
We got company!
Get out here.

28:17.780 --> 28:19.447
Get down.
Grounders.

28:32.503 --> 28:33.544
We're surrounded.

28:42.846 --> 28:45.181
Airlock pressure.
Approaching red zone.

28:49.103 --> 28:50.144
I can't open
the inner door!

28:50.354 --> 28:51.646
We must've
blown a seal.

28:51.855 --> 28:54.273
The doors won't open
until we're equalized!

28:54.483 --> 28:56.609
Airlock pressure
now critical.

29:01.031 --> 29:02.615
- The door!
- Raven!

29:02.825 --> 29:04.033
Manual
override.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.292
Emergency
override authorized.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.089
Unh. Shut the door.

29:24.930 --> 29:25.972
Are you OK?

29:27.391 --> 29:28.558
Emergency support teams

29:28.767 --> 29:31.269
to airlock b-17 immediately.

29:32.396 --> 29:33.396
We gotta get
out of here.

29:33.605 --> 29:34.564
It was a breach.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.149
The section doors
are sealed.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.155
Take off the suit.

29:42.364 --> 29:44.115
Take it off
and give it to me.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.826
Finn, Finn, that breach
lost a lot of oxygen.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.995
That plus
an unauthorized spacewalk,

29:49.204 --> 29:50.663
it's a capital crime.

29:50.873 --> 29:52.915
I'm still 17.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.584
I'll go to the Skybox
for a couple months,

29:54.793 --> 29:55.710
then I'll get a review.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.128
- Review?
- I'll have a chance.

29:57.337 --> 30:00.131
A good one.
Raven, you're 18.

30:01.675 --> 30:02.759
You'll get floated.

30:04.595 --> 30:05.511
Take off the suit.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.097
Now!

30:18.150 --> 30:19.066
There he is.

30:23.572 --> 30:24.822
Am I gonna get
in trouble for this?

30:35.793 --> 30:37.084
They're not moving
any closer.

30:38.462 --> 30:40.296
Staying out of range.

30:40.506 --> 30:43.382
Probably waiting
until it's dark.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.885
If we hit them now, at least
we'd take them by surprise.

30:46.094 --> 30:47.887
We don't even know
how many of them are out there.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.431
I'm not hearing any
better ideas, Clarke.

30:50.641 --> 30:51.808
We'll give them something.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.476
All they want
is Finn.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.186
Finn wasn't the only
one at the village.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.231
What are you
talking about?

30:58.440 --> 30:59.273
Raven, hold on.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.234
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:01.443 --> 31:02.819
Raven, I came here
to protect him.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.570
You were the one who
wanted me to come. You--

31:12.830 --> 31:14.705
that's why you asked me
to come along.

31:14.915 --> 31:16.123
Enough grounders
saw him at the village.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.542
They'd believe
he was the shooter.

31:19.253 --> 31:20.169
Sick bitch.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.004
Raven, you don't
mean this.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.381
You know what they
do to people.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.716
They want a murderer,
we'll give them one.

31:25.926 --> 31:27.552
Drop your gun.

31:31.265 --> 31:32.765
Go to hell, raven.

31:32.975 --> 31:34.767
Put it down, raven.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.602
Like it or not,
he's one of us.

31:36.812 --> 31:37.854
I said drop it.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.272
Stop! Stop!

31:41.942 --> 31:42.984
We're not
doing this.

31:45.112 --> 31:46.904
They've got us
surrounded.

31:47.114 --> 31:49.490
The only thing we
can do is stay.

31:49.700 --> 31:50.950
And defend
this place.

31:53.370 --> 31:54.370
I'm with you.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.167
- Murphy...
- Yeah.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.920
Go upstairs.
Watch the rear.

32:03.130 --> 32:04.255
I'll take
the lower level.

32:04.464 --> 32:06.841
You three,
take the front gate.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.721
That's the plan.
All right?

32:24.735 --> 32:27.361
Hey.
We got this.

32:30.407 --> 32:31.407
May we meet again.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.329
We will.

32:36.538 --> 32:37.705
Yeah.

32:55.641 --> 32:56.641
Be careful.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.185
You, too.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.088
See anything?

33:27.297 --> 33:29.006
No.

33:31.885 --> 33:33.344
Someone's coming.

33:34.513 --> 33:35.304
There.

33:37.641 --> 33:38.641
Finn?

33:40.227 --> 33:41.102
No.

33:42.771 --> 33:43.771
Finn!

34:03.458 --> 34:04.458
Reyes!

34:06.461 --> 34:08.129
Yes, sir.

34:08.338 --> 34:09.880
How's that
supply line coming?

34:10.090 --> 34:12.133
It's a piece of crap.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.969
Sir. But I'll
get it working.

34:15.178 --> 34:17.555
No, you won't.
I'm pulling you off duty.

34:17.764 --> 34:21.392
You got your zero-g certification.
Congratulations.

34:21.601 --> 34:22.727
But I failed
the physical.

34:22.936 --> 34:24.812
Yeah, I saw
your test scores.

34:25.022 --> 34:26.731
I overruled the rejection.
You're in.

34:29.401 --> 34:30.443
Now, get moving.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.092
What is that?

34:56.344 --> 34:57.344
It's for Finn.

34:58.555 --> 34:59.805
They want us to watch.

35:01.183 --> 35:02.516
We're gonna get him.

35:02.726 --> 35:05.186
We'll get in close
and we'll hit them hard.

35:05.395 --> 35:09.690
Son... There's
thousands of them.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.776
Even if we could
kill hundreds,

35:11.985 --> 35:13.277
they'd still
wipe out this camp

35:13.487 --> 35:14.528
and your friend
would still die.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.156
We have to try.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.158
Abby.

35:19.367 --> 35:20.910
Abby, we have
to do something.

35:23.455 --> 35:24.622
No, raven.

35:41.264 --> 35:42.306
Take this.

35:42.516 --> 35:43.474
What are
you doing?

35:43.683 --> 35:45.101
I'm gonna talk
to the commander.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.060
What else do you
have to say?

35:46.269 --> 35:48.104
I don't know.

35:48.313 --> 35:49.188
I don't know.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.940
- Clarke.
- Give me your hand.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.702
If she won't
let him go, kill her.

36:06.206 --> 36:09.041
Things'll go crazy,
and we'll grab you and Finn.

36:11.753 --> 36:14.839
Clarke.
You have to help him.

36:16.258 --> 36:17.508
I owe him my life.

36:34.317 --> 36:37.528
Clarke. What is
she doing?

36:37.737 --> 36:39.822
Wait.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.741
Abby. Gotta
let her try.

36:57.883 --> 36:58.966
What is she doing?

37:16.651 --> 37:18.402
I'm here to talk
to your commander.

37:30.373 --> 37:31.415
Let me through.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.169
Let her pass.

37:50.060 --> 37:51.477
You bleed
for nothing.

37:53.230 --> 37:54.980
You cannot stop this.

37:55.190 --> 37:58.567
No. Only you can.

38:14.334 --> 38:17.711
Show my people how
powerful you are.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.260
Show them you
can be merciful.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.263
Show them you're
not a savage.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.725
We are what we are.

38:35.689 --> 38:36.730
Then I'm a killer.

38:38.108 --> 38:40.985
I burned
300 of your people.

38:41.194 --> 38:44.363
I slit a man's throat
and watched him die.

38:44.572 --> 38:47.032
I'm soaked
in grounder blood.

38:48.994 --> 38:50.035
Take me.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.960
But Finn is guilty.

38:58.169 --> 39:01.088
No. He did it
for me.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.342
He did it for me.

39:07.595 --> 39:08.971
Then he dies
for you.

39:13.893 --> 39:16.103
Come on, Clarke.
Do it.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.338
Can I say good-bye?

40:00.523 --> 40:01.648
What is
she doing?

40:22.128 --> 40:23.253
I love you, too.

40:27.759 --> 40:28.717
I'm scared.

40:38.478 --> 40:40.562
You're gonna be OK.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.319
You're OK.

40:50.407 --> 40:51.949
Thanks, princess.

41:19.561 --> 41:21.103
It is done.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.237
No!

41:33.408 --> 41:36.618
No! No!

41:36.828 --> 41:39.580
No! No!

41:43.209 --> 41:45.502
No!
