WOMAN: There's an isolation
to the woods, isn't there?

00:50.091 --> 00:55.055
A sense of unease
in a dark wilderness.

00:55.096 --> 00:58.266
Because things disappear there.

00:58.308 --> 01:01.102
Things die there.

01:01.144 --> 01:05.065
But she wasn't afraid.
Not at first.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.483
Even though she was alone,

01:06.524 --> 01:09.819
she knew
she could survive the night.

01:09.861 --> 01:15.367
But as she got deeper into
the forest, she smelled it.

01:15.408 --> 01:19.996
The rot. The smell of death.

01:20.038 --> 01:23.416
CONTINUES ON RADIO: She finally
found them in the clearing.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.418
By now, the long, hot summer

01:25.460 --> 01:28.213
had caused the bodies
to putrefy.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.632
The flies and maggots
were crawl...

01:30.674 --> 01:31.925

I don't wanna make you straight.

05:42.175 --> 05:46.054
Gay people are A-OK with me.

05:47.555 --> 05:52.686
If you're happy the way you are,
then more power to you.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.439
And I know what you're thinking.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.108
You hear the words
"gay conversion camp,"

05:58.149 --> 06:00.985
and you start to imagine all
kinds of homophobic bullshit.

06:01.027 --> 06:05.198
Well, that is not
what we're about here.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.033
And let me tell you
another thing.

06:07.075 --> 06:12.122
God...
God doesn't hate you either.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.666
And any son of a bitch
that tells you otherwise

06:14.708 --> 06:15.750
is a bigoted asshole.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.420
And that is officially
the last time

06:18.461 --> 06:20.922
that you're gonna hear
about the man upstairs.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.882
I promise you.

06:24.050 --> 06:28.722
But I'm guessing
that some of you are here

06:28.763 --> 06:32.017
because in some way
you're not happy.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.102
Maybe you don't fit in.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.770
People make fun of you.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.815
Maybe you wanna find
some new kind of peace,

06:38.857 --> 06:41.151
a new way of thinking
about yourself.

06:41.192 --> 06:47.282
Well, you give us this week,
and we might be able to help.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.243
And if not, just enjoy
the sunshine,

06:50.285 --> 06:52.912
and work on your tan.

06:52.954 --> 06:57.000
OK. Let me introduce you
to my colleagues.

06:57.042 --> 07:00.170
They do all the real work.
I just cash the checks.

07:00.211 --> 07:04.174
This is Dr. Cora Whistler.
She is our licensed therapist,

07:04.215 --> 07:07.719
and as you might have guessed
from the name, my wife.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.512
She who must be obeyed.

07:09.554 --> 07:10.930
Next to her is Nurse Molly

07:10.972 --> 07:13.099
who takes care of any
little mishaps that may occur.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.770
Molly's new here,
so take it easy on her.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.439
And that's Zane,
our athletics director

07:19.481 --> 07:21.149
and a former student here.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.901
So, he knows all the ropes.

07:22.942 --> 07:26.112
And, boys, he's taken,
so hands off.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.283
And that beautiful woman
right there

07:30.325 --> 07:31.910
is Sarah, Zane's fiancÃ©.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.454
She's our activities director,

07:34.496 --> 07:37.123
and she is going
to keep you busy.

all-around Mr. Fix it.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.841
Say hello, Balthazar!

07:49.678 --> 07:54.808
And that, finally, is old Duke.

07:54.849 --> 08:01.648
Duke is one old hound dog.
So please treat him kindly.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.527
OK. I'm gonna need you
to hand over

08:05.568 --> 08:08.071
all your cell phones
and computers.

08:08.113 --> 08:09.447

08:09.489 --> 08:13.159

narcotics, or cigarettes

08:13.201 --> 08:14.244
that you may have.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.079
Cell phones don't work
out here anyway,

08:16.121 --> 08:18.039
and I'm glad to say
that we don't have any Wi-Fi.

08:18.081 --> 08:22.669
So we are off the grid which
will be a nice change, I'm sure.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.547
Molly, if you would. Thank you.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.760
OK. Let me tell you
how the next week is gonna work.

08:30.802 --> 08:34.514
We have a number of planned
activities and therapy sessions

08:34.556 --> 08:36.641
that we would like you
to be part of.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.561
But other than that,
you're on your own.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.772
We do have
one hard-and-fast rule here.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.733
And it's about respect.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.359
We deal
with some sensitive issues,

08:46.401 --> 08:50.488
and we expect you to treat
your fellow students with care.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.574
And allow them their dignity.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.202
This is a safe space.

08:56.244 --> 08:57.746
For everyone.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.666
And this is
the most important thing

09:01.708 --> 09:03.918
that I want to say to you.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.590
I know that many of you are here

09:08.631 --> 09:11.968
only because your parents
made you.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.889
And while their intentions
may be honorable,

09:15.930 --> 09:18.933
only you can know
what's best for you.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.602
Because the idea of this place

09:20.643 --> 09:24.564
is not to come out
more straight or less gay.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.858
Of course we hope
that through your time here

09:26.900 --> 09:29.027
you will discover
a gender normative lifestyle

09:29.069 --> 09:31.279
that is authentic for you but...

09:32.447 --> 09:36.618
you must find your own truth.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.954
Let us help you do that.

09:40.622 --> 09:42.040
Please.

09:45.752 --> 09:49.673
OK. So, uh, why don't you
head to your cabins?

09:49.714 --> 09:51.257
Settle in. Unpack.

09:51.299 --> 09:54.969
We'll meet in the lodge in say,
uh, a half hour and get started.

09:55.011 --> 09:58.139
Boys' cabin over there.
Girls' cabin over there.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.409
Yes.

10:17.450 --> 10:22.288
-So this is a thing.
-OK.

10:22.330 --> 10:26.793
I'm trans and nonbinary.
I use they/them pronouns.

10:26.835 --> 10:31.006
As in, they can't believe
they're at this fucking camp.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.676
I'm assuming you don't have
an all-gender cabin.

10:34.718 --> 10:38.263
No. Not currently.
Obviously we need one.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.682
Maybe so.

10:42.851 --> 10:47.105
This place
is all about inclusion.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.567
About being with other kids

10:50.608 --> 10:52.861
and finding
a sense of community.

10:52.902 --> 10:57.032
So it's important
that nobody be isolated.

10:57.073 --> 11:01.703
I acknowledge
and respect your transition.

11:01.745 --> 11:04.289
So head over to the boys' cabin,

11:04.330 --> 11:07.500
and if you don't feel
comfortable there,

11:07.542 --> 11:10.045
we can talk about other options.

11:10.879 --> 11:12.380
How's that?

11:14.257 --> 11:15.592
Sounds great.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.845
Great. Thanks.

11:18.887 --> 11:22.307
And thanks for understanding.

-Yes, ma'am.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.994

11:49.751 --> 11:54.422
I want to start with a simple
question. Why are you here?

12:00.428 --> 12:02.138
Toby?

12:04.599 --> 12:06.893
I'm here because

12:06.935 --> 12:11.773
I don't want to be
a big flaming fruit anymore.

12:11.815 --> 12:16.569
I wanna play hockey
and drink non-light beer

12:16.611 --> 12:18.863
like all the normal guys.

12:20.615 --> 12:23.451
I made a deal with my parents.
If I spent the week here,

12:23.493 --> 12:25.704
I could go to New York
and see Moulin Rouge!.

12:25.745 --> 12:26.746
(ALL CHUCKLE)

12:26.788 --> 12:28.331

a Sondheim man.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.083
-Queen!
-Well, you're looking at a guy

12:30.125 --> 12:32.711
that saw the original production
of Merrilytwice.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.839
-Bitch!
-(LAUGHS)

12:35.880 --> 12:39.384
Veronica. What about you?
Why are you here?

12:39.426 --> 12:40.969
Um...

12:42.554 --> 12:44.097
-No.
-MAN: Please.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.891
There's no judgments in
this room, OK? Why are you here?

12:46.933 --> 12:50.437
Cause I'm bisexual.
So, I'm a freak and I hate it.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.982
All right? Are you happy?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.112
I'm a swimmer.

12:59.154 --> 13:03.575
I know I can get a scholarship,
but not like this.

13:04.409 --> 13:07.245
Not like I am.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.289
I mean, in the locker room
I don't know where to look.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.624
I get so tense
I have to, like, throw up.

13:11.666 --> 13:14.002
No one knows in school.

13:15.170 --> 13:17.505
I'd die if they found out.

13:20.175 --> 13:25.722
It's like I'm pretending
to be this thing and...

13:25.764 --> 13:27.932
I don't wanna pretend anymore.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.934
My parents made me come.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.353
I just wanna fit in.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.438
It was come here or you're out
on the street, honey.

13:33.480 --> 13:36.066
When I go to college, I'm gonna
pledge my dad's fraternity,

13:36.107 --> 13:39.110
which I kind of have to,
or he's gonna, like, disown me.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.653
I mean, house seats.

13:40.695 --> 13:42.864
I'm not that complicated,
honestly.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.075
I just wanna be
like everybody else.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.201
Fifth row, center.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.037
I wanna give my parents
grandkids.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.123
Like my sister did.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.000
I'm only here to shut
my parents up

13:54.042 --> 13:55.585
and get some fucking peace.

13:55.627 --> 14:00.882
I have zero interest in not
being gay. I love me some lady.

14:00.924 --> 14:04.135
I hear it all the time. "Fag."

14:04.177 --> 14:07.889
"There goes the fag."
"Blow me, fag."

14:10.058 --> 14:11.351
And the laughter.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.520
I don't wanna waste my soul
fighting this thing.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.188
I just wanna make it go away.

14:15.230 --> 14:17.941
Sometimes I wish
I was invisible.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.609
I wanna be entertained.

14:19.651 --> 14:22.028
I wanna live my life.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.364
I wanna fit in.

14:24.406 --> 14:26.241
I wanna be loved.

14:44.134 --> 14:45.927
Jordan, you're awfully quiet.

14:46.970 --> 14:51.433
Uh, I don't have
anything to add.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.893
Is he gonna get away with that?

14:53.935 --> 14:55.520
-They.
-Whatever the fuck.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.355
We all talked.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.400
Jordan, this is
a circle of trust.

15:00.442 --> 15:03.695
We all shared.
Why are you here?

15:09.117 --> 15:11.953
I come from a religious family.

15:12.871 --> 15:15.623
They don't understand me.

15:15.665 --> 15:19.627
We made a deal.
If I come here for a week...

15:20.879 --> 15:23.465
they'll let me legally
emancipate myself.

15:25.383 --> 15:28.011
Emancipate yourself to do what?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.681
Be myself.

15:37.020 --> 15:39.939
All right. I wanna thank you all

15:39.981 --> 15:43.401
for your trust
and for your honesty.

15:43.443 --> 15:47.322
I've been through therapy, so I
know how difficult this can be.

15:49.324 --> 15:53.453
Being at peace with yourself,
with your true self,

15:53.495 --> 15:56.164
that's the hardest thing to do,
isn't it?

15:57.624 --> 16:01.044
OK. That's it for today.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.962
So, dinner is in an hour,

16:03.004 --> 16:06.132
and we'll start up again
in the morning.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.009
Enjoy the night.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.782

19:18.408 --> 19:20.702
Gentlemen,
you have a new roommate.

19:20.744 --> 19:23.163
All I ask from you people
is honesty.

19:23.204 --> 19:25.457
Honesty
in how you treat each other.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.625
And honesty in
how you present yourselves.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.502
Lying is not going
to get us anywhere.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.504
I wasn't lying.
This is who I am.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.465
Jordan treated me with respect

19:33.506 --> 19:36.092
by being truthful
about their transition.

19:36.134 --> 19:39.262
You did not. Simple as that.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.389
OK, everyone out front.
Ten minutes for roll call.

19:41.431 --> 19:45.560
And, please,
dress appropriately.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.358
The fuck is this?

19:51.399 --> 19:53.026
What does it fucking look like,
boyfriend?

19:53.068 --> 19:55.487
Freak show
is what it looks like.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.739
How am I supposed
to dress appropriately?

19:57.781 --> 20:00.700
I'm a woman. I don't have
any goddamn boy clothes.

20:00.742 --> 20:02.369
JORDAN: Hey. Hey.

20:02.410 --> 20:06.831
Don't worry about it. OK?

46:44.846 --> 46:46.348
Be careful.

46:46.389 --> 46:51.186

and... he doesn't like you.

who he's hunting this time.

a little bit.

48:34.205 --> 48:37.375
It's a great day to be alive,
isn't it?

48:38.418 --> 48:40.920
Come on, Duke.
Come on. Let's go, boy.

48:40.962 --> 48:42.589
-Let's get out of here.
-See ya.

48:42.630 --> 48:44.632

48:49.262 --> 48:51.473
-He's sick.
-What?

48:51.514 --> 48:54.476
When our dog got sick,
he walked like that.

48:54.517 --> 48:58.480
So sad.
I hate to see animals in pain.

48:59.564 --> 49:02.984
I have a new dog now.
He's a dachshund.

49:03.026 --> 49:07.489
-Miniature, of course.
-Of course.

49:12.911 --> 49:16.873
Today we're gonna be exploring
traditional gender roles.

49:16.915 --> 49:19.209
By behaving in a certain way,

49:19.250 --> 49:20.877
by learning to recognize

49:20.919 --> 49:23.463
and accept modes
of societal behaviors,

49:23.505 --> 49:26.299
perhaps we'll come to appreciate
the emotional value

49:26.341 --> 49:28.843
in reinforcing these behaviors.

49:28.885 --> 49:33.348
Even finding comfort and a sense
of community within them.

49:34.849 --> 49:37.018

(CHUCKLES)

49:45.151 --> 49:46.986
OWEN: OK. Listen up.

49:47.028 --> 49:49.781
Two things control this world.

49:49.823 --> 49:53.410
Biology and history.

49:53.451 --> 49:57.247
I know this is not
a popular thing to say nowadays,

49:57.288 --> 49:59.916
but men have naturally evolved

49:59.958 --> 50:04.170
to be larger and stronger
than women.

50:04.212 --> 50:05.797
There's a reason for that.

50:05.839 --> 50:08.425
Our forefathers were hunters.

50:08.466 --> 50:12.095
They had to chase down game
and subdue it.

50:12.137 --> 50:16.016
They hunted or they starved.

50:16.057 --> 50:18.685
It's in our DNA, gentlemen.

50:18.727 --> 50:20.770
We're meant to be killers.

50:21.604 --> 50:24.357
This is
our biological imperative.

50:24.399 --> 50:28.903
And no amount of civilization,
no amount of progress,

50:28.945 --> 50:35.618
no amount of liberal humanism
can alter that genetic truth.

50:36.953 --> 50:39.289
You can't argue with science.

50:39.330 --> 50:40.623
And science tells us that

50:40.665 --> 50:43.543
we are meant to pass
that necessary DNA

50:43.585 --> 50:47.714
down through the bloodline,
through women,

50:47.756 --> 50:51.259
through impregnating women
and having children.

50:52.635 --> 50:56.097
That is science.
And that is history.

50:57.640 --> 50:59.100
So...

51:00.852 --> 51:03.271
Who's got the killer instinct?

51:12.614 --> 51:15.784
-Oh, amazing. Good job.

1:26:07.959 --> 1:26:09.085
Don't turn your back on them.

1:26:09.127 --> 1:26:10.587
You think one of the kids
did this?

1:26:10.628 --> 1:26:13.423
All the counselors are dead.
Open your fucking eyes.

1:26:13.465 --> 1:26:16.217
They're not the angels
you think they are.

ALEXANDRA: I am not waiting
around for that psychopath

1:27:19.030 --> 1:27:20.490
to show up with the bus.

1:27:20.532 --> 1:27:24.244
No, ma'am. I'm getting out
of here. I will fucking walk.

1:27:24.285 --> 1:27:26.538
-You really gonna walk?
-Hell, yes.

1:27:26.579 --> 1:27:28.289
Can you take them with you?

1:27:29.290 --> 1:27:31.167
It's gonna be safer
if you're together.

1:27:31.209 --> 1:27:32.377
We need to get them out of here.

1:27:32.419 --> 1:27:33.962
I'm gonna stay here
with Toby and Stu.

1:27:34.004 --> 1:27:35.380
Alexandra, are you up for this?

1:27:35.422 --> 1:27:36.923
They're scared,
and it's a long way to town.

1:27:36.965 --> 1:27:39.801
Honey, please.
I'm a Black transgender woman.

1:27:39.843 --> 1:27:42.762
-I could do it in heels.
-My password is 0131.

1:27:42.804 --> 1:27:45.640
As soon as you get
in cell range, call the police.

1:27:47.225 --> 1:27:50.353
All right, kids, time to go.

1:27:50.395 --> 1:27:54.774
Come on. Right now.
Step up your pussies.

1:27:56.609 --> 1:27:58.653
Stay close to Mamma.

1:28:03.658 --> 1:28:07.328
Come on.
All right, stay close to me.

1:28:13.251 --> 1:28:15.837
You guys go to the infirmary.
Stay there. Don't leave.

1:28:15.879 --> 1:28:17.714
I'm gonna get
that damn generator working,

1:28:17.756 --> 1:28:20.008
and I don't trust Owen and Cora.

1:28:23.386 --> 1:28:25.138
You go ahead.
I'm gonna go get the rifles.

1:28:25.180 --> 1:28:27.599
-No!
-This isn't over.

1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:29.351
You know that, right?

1:28:29.392 --> 1:28:31.811
You go on ahead.
I'll be right behind you.

1:28:31.853 --> 1:28:33.688
Do either of you
know how to shoot?

1:28:33.730 --> 1:28:35.482
BOTH: Yes.

1:28:35.523 --> 1:28:37.484
Of course you do.

1:29:12.769 --> 1:29:15.522
OWEN: Cora!
Where are the goddamn rifles?

1:29:17.315 --> 1:29:18.900

(OWEN GRUNTS)

1:30:19.919 --> 1:30:22.088
You don't remember me, do you?

1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:25.467
So many kids
have been through here,

1:30:25.508 --> 1:30:28.762
how can you be expected
to remember them all?

1:30:28.803 --> 1:30:31.806
-Molly, I...
-Oh, no. I'm not Molly.

1:30:32.766 --> 1:30:35.060
Molly's dead in her car
on the way here,

1:30:35.101 --> 1:30:36.811
so I could take her place.

1:30:38.646 --> 1:30:40.648
My name's Angie.

1:30:41.733 --> 1:30:44.903
Angie Phelps.
Do you remember her?

1:30:45.862 --> 1:30:46.988
Stay down!

1:30:50.200 --> 1:30:53.870
No? Angie Phelps. Nothing?

1:30:55.705 --> 1:31:00.543
She was only 14...
when you first met her.

1:31:01.836 --> 1:31:05.674
She was a good girl... then.

1:31:07.509 --> 1:31:10.970
Before all this,
before you put her in that chair

1:31:11.012 --> 1:31:15.475
and burned
all the good out of her.

1:31:15.517 --> 1:31:18.019
-You must understand...
-No, I mustn't.

1:31:18.061 --> 1:31:21.314
No more words,
Owen. No more speeches!

1:31:21.356 --> 1:31:24.984
When Angie left here,
it was the suicide attempts,

1:31:25.026 --> 1:31:29.364
and the loneliness,
and the self-hatred,

1:31:29.406 --> 1:31:35.704
and pills, and the doctors, and,
oh, the anger, so much anger.

1:31:37.122 --> 1:31:41.209
I woke up one morning
and realized...

1:31:42.711 --> 1:31:45.213
my soul was just hollow.

1:31:47.257 --> 1:31:49.759
But you know all about that.

1:31:51.886 --> 1:31:54.556
That's what you do to people.

1:31:55.598 --> 1:31:57.225
To children.

1:31:58.226 --> 1:32:00.895
You hollow them out.

1:32:05.233 --> 1:32:07.652
And when all of this comes out,

1:32:08.737 --> 1:32:11.197
in the news, on TV,

1:32:11.239 --> 1:32:14.826
all of the bodies,
all the horror of it,

1:32:14.868 --> 1:32:21.082
no one will ever send their kids
to a place like this again.

1:32:22.542 --> 1:32:26.504
And you, and everyone like you,

1:32:26.546 --> 1:32:32.927

right next to me.

1:33:06.169 --> 1:33:07.295
Do it!

1:33:09.964 --> 1:33:12.884
Shooting a sick, old dog
is one thing, Jordan.

1:33:13.635 --> 1:33:16.388
But shooting a man...

1:33:16.429 --> 1:33:21.893
No, sir. I mean, that takes
a certain kind of heart.

1:33:22.644 --> 1:33:25.105
You don't know me.

1:33:25.146 --> 1:33:27.273
You don't know
anything about me.

1:33:27.315 --> 1:33:31.736
Oh, I know everything about you.
I know you're scared.

1:33:32.821 --> 1:33:35.615
I know you want this to end.

1:33:35.657 --> 1:33:38.243
But not like this, son.
Not like this.

1:33:38.993 --> 1:33:41.121
Jordan, you saw the pictures.

1:33:41.162 --> 1:33:43.623
All those kids.
All that torture.

1:33:43.665 --> 1:33:46.167
You know what he does here.

1:33:46.209 --> 1:33:50.714
End this now! You're strong
enough to do this, Jordan.

1:34:04.602 --> 1:34:06.229
No.

1:34:08.314 --> 1:34:10.650
I'm strong enough

1:34:10.692 --> 1:34:13.862
to not do this.

All I did was make those kids
into who they wanted to be.

You made me too.
And this is my truth.

1:34:43.683 --> 1:34:46.686

1:34:46.728 --> 1:34:49.898
Rejoice. Revenge!

1:35:07.082 --> 1:35:11.252
It gets easier. You'll see.

1:35:12.796 --> 1:35:15.382
There are so many
camps like this.

1:35:15.423 --> 1:35:17.425

OK.

1:35:28.019 --> 1:35:31.231
So, what are we gonna tell them?
We can say he... did it.

1:35:31.272 --> 1:35:33.274
-He killed them and we...
-Enough.

1:35:35.694 --> 1:35:38.113

like this is closed.

1:35:46.705 --> 1:35:48.957
When we've killed them all.

1:35:50.250 --> 1:35:53.837
We could do that, Jordan.
You and me.

1:35:59.009 --> 1:36:01.344
You can try to stop me,

1:36:01.386 --> 1:36:06.141
but I'm going to go
to my friends now.

1:36:07.350 --> 1:36:11.813
We're gonna leave this place
and never look back.

1:36:11.855 --> 1:36:17.485
And no one is ever going to
tell us who we are ever again.

1:36:18.319 --> 1:36:21.948
Not him. Not you.

1:36:23.533 --> 1:36:25.368
No one.

I'm trying to save you.

What are you gonna tell
your parents?

1:38:37.208 --> 1:38:39.127
We'll tell them together.
