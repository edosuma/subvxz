01:44.016 --> 01:45.453
Morning, Monica.Good morning, sir.

01:45.496 --> 01:47.716
Hey.
Calvin. What...?

01:50.197 --> 01:53.722
Sorry to let myself in,
but nobody was out front.

01:53.765 --> 01:55.071
Yeah, no, no,
my assistant's not here.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.334
It's not like her
to be late.
Yeah, well,

01:57.378 --> 01:59.554
Monday mornings
are rough for everyone, right?

01:59.597 --> 02:02.296
Yeah. What are you
doing here, Cal

02:02.339 --> 02:04.298
Our appointment's
not until tomorrow.

02:04.341 --> 02:06.430
I just couldn't wait that long
to see Dwayne Pride

02:06.474 --> 02:07.736
in a suit and tie.
Yeah.

02:07.779 --> 02:10.217
Almost makes me
look respectable.
Almost.

02:10.260 --> 02:13.350
You don't need
to stall, Doc.

02:13.394 --> 02:14.960
What'd you find out?

02:15.004 --> 02:17.006
Actually, nothing.

02:17.049 --> 02:19.051
I reviewed the diagnostics
you sent me.

02:19.095 --> 02:22.054
Cerebral angiogram was clear.
Blood flow normal.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.187
No structural abnormalities.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.537
Bottom line, your brain is
in perfect working order.

02:26.581 --> 02:29.018
Exactly what my
neurologist said.

02:29.061 --> 02:31.586
You seem disappointed.
'Cause, you know, usually,

02:31.629 --> 02:34.676
patients are happy when
they find out they're okay.

02:34.719 --> 02:36.678
I just, uh...

02:40.856 --> 02:43.424
I just want to know
what's happening to me.

02:43.467 --> 02:47.645
Ever since the shooting,
I've been seeing things.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.430
Hallucinations?

02:49.473 --> 02:54.696
Disconnected moments in time.
Disjointed memories.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.915
People who aren't there.

02:56.959 --> 03:00.571
Sometimes I can barely
tell 'em apart from reality.

03:00.615 --> 03:02.791
Have you been sleeping?

03:02.834 --> 03:06.360
Couple hours every night,
if I'm lucky.

03:06.403 --> 03:07.752
Most nights I'm not.

03:07.796 --> 03:13.105
Well, flashbacks, nightmares,
sleeping disturbances,

03:13.149 --> 03:14.672
it's all textbook PTSD.PTSD.

03:14.716 --> 03:17.458
Also what my neurologist said.

03:17.501 --> 03:18.589
Your body has healed,

03:18.633 --> 03:20.287
but your mind's still
playing catch-up.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.897
You're gonna tell me
I need therapy?

03:21.940 --> 03:23.420
And you're gonna tell me
you don't have time.

03:23.464 --> 03:29.209
Which is why I am prescribing
Alprazolam for the anxiety,

03:29.252 --> 03:31.776
Zolpidem, for the
sleepless nights,

03:31.820 --> 03:34.344
and an SSRI cocktail just to
help you push through.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.433
You know I'm not a fan
of pharmaceuticals.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.392
And also know that you are
dangerously close

03:38.435 --> 03:40.220
to a breaking point, Dwayne.

03:40.263 --> 03:43.571
One way or another,
something's got to give.

03:44.789 --> 03:47.531
Here.

03:47.575 --> 03:50.404
Where you go from here,
that's entirely up to you.

03:56.627 --> 03:58.977
Hannah.

03:59.021 --> 04:01.197
What?

04:02.503 --> 04:03.634
Yeah, I'm on my way.

04:03.678 --> 04:05.854
What's up?They just found my assistant.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.902
State police picked her up

04:10.946 --> 04:12.556
wandering on the side
of the road.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.819
She was abducted by
a single male suspect.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.168
He held her captive.

04:16.212 --> 04:18.649
Assault?She's pretty banged up.

04:18.693 --> 04:21.696
Fortunately, the rape kit
results were negative.

04:21.739 --> 04:24.089
What else does she remember?I don't know yet.

04:24.133 --> 04:26.527
She said she wanted
to talk to you first.

04:30.226 --> 04:32.489
Hey.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.099
Hi.

04:34.143 --> 04:35.666
Ginny.

04:35.710 --> 04:38.103
Special Agent Pride.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.453
I'm so sorry.

04:39.496 --> 04:41.977
Sorry about what?

04:42.020 --> 04:45.328
You did exactly what
you were supposed to do, Ginny.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.678
Survive.
No.

04:47.722 --> 04:50.942
I let my guard down.It's not your fault.

04:50.986 --> 04:54.903
We're gonna get the guy.
I can promise you that.

04:54.946 --> 04:57.122
But we're gonna need your help.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.517
I never saw his face.

05:00.561 --> 05:02.780
That's okay, just tell us
what you do remember.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.565
This is Agent Khoury.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.175
Hannah.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.655
Hi, Ginny.

05:09.657 --> 05:13.530
I met up with a...
couple of friends

05:13.574 --> 05:16.185
after work on Friday.

05:16.228 --> 05:17.621
We wanted to

05:17.665 --> 05:20.885
hear some music,
have some drinks.

05:20.929 --> 05:22.104
Where?

05:22.147 --> 05:23.975
Uh, the Bacchanal.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.673
We were...

05:25.716 --> 05:28.632
all dancing,

05:28.676 --> 05:32.419
feeling great.

05:32.462 --> 05:35.422
Then all of a sudden,
I-I felt sick.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.467
The room was spinning.

05:37.511 --> 05:39.469
I-I only had one drink.

05:39.513 --> 05:40.427
Suspect may have spiked it.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.037
I know that I
should have

05:42.080 --> 05:43.647
kept an eye on my drink,

05:43.691 --> 05:45.823
shouldn't have left alone.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.478
I know the things that
I'm supposed to do.

05:48.522 --> 05:50.654
Ginny, it's okay.I should have called a car.

05:50.698 --> 05:53.440
I just felt so bad that I...

05:53.483 --> 05:56.312
started walking.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.359
I thought the fresh air
would help.In what direction

05:59.402 --> 06:01.230
did you walk?I don't know.

06:01.273 --> 06:05.147
Next thing I remember is
waking up in that house.

06:06.975 --> 06:10.587
Hanging there,
alone in the dark.

06:10.631 --> 06:14.461
Tell us what you saw
after you escaped.

06:14.504 --> 06:16.245
There were, um,

06:16.288 --> 06:19.596
houses everywhere.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.555
But no one was there.

06:21.598 --> 06:24.427
They were all abandoned.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.429
Like a nightmare.

06:26.473 --> 06:27.735
Did you see any
street signs,

06:27.778 --> 06:29.606
visual landmarks?

06:29.650 --> 06:32.304
I can't remember.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.439
Maybe if you take me out,

06:36.483 --> 06:37.484
drive me around,

06:37.527 --> 06:39.486
I'll see something
I recognize.

06:39.529 --> 06:40.574
We can go now.

06:40.617 --> 06:43.054
No.

06:43.098 --> 06:46.536
You need to stay here and let
the doctors take care of you.

06:46.580 --> 06:47.972
We can handle
the rest right now.

06:48.016 --> 06:49.104
I can't sit here

06:49.147 --> 06:50.497
and do nothing.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.629
He's still out there.
He could hurt somebody else.

06:52.673 --> 06:55.632
You said that you needed
my help.

06:55.676 --> 06:59.636
I am willing to do
whatever it takes.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.465
Just like you,
Special Agent Pride.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.607
Pride?

07:13.650 --> 07:15.130
Are you okay?

07:19.526 --> 07:21.179
We need to...

07:21.223 --> 07:23.051
We need to loop
the team in,

07:23.094 --> 07:24.705
and, uh...

07:24.748 --> 07:26.315
we need to somehow

07:26.358 --> 07:27.969
narrow down the search area

07:28.012 --> 07:29.536
and find that house.

07:29.579 --> 07:32.495
Okay, I'll coordinate with NOPD.

07:32.539 --> 07:33.757
Okay.

07:33.801 --> 07:36.281
Ginny.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.675
If the docs sign off,
we're gonna get you discharged,

07:38.719 --> 07:39.720
and you and I are gonna

07:39.763 --> 07:41.417
break this case together.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.724
Okay.
Okay.

07:43.767 --> 07:45.943
GREGORIO:
13 years after Katrina,

07:45.987 --> 07:47.728
and there are still thousands
of blighted houses

07:47.771 --> 07:49.120
across the city.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.732
Most of these communities
look like ghost towns.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.211
How are we supposed to find

07:53.255 --> 07:55.300
one particular abandoned house
without any description?

07:55.344 --> 07:57.955
Police picked Ginny up
deep in New Orleans East.

07:57.999 --> 08:00.349
Even if she ran full
stride for an hour,

08:00.392 --> 08:01.785
there's no way she'd
travel that far.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.570
I mean, maybe six
to eight miles.

08:03.613 --> 08:06.224
Cut that in half, there are
still 200 abandoned houses

08:06.268 --> 08:07.791
she could have
escaped from.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.793
Gonna take us
days to check 'em all.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.534
Perp be long gone by then.Yeah.

08:11.578 --> 08:12.927
I might have a faster way
of finding him.

08:12.970 --> 08:14.145
LASALLE:
We're all ears.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.843
So, the handcuffs
that Ginny was wearing

08:15.886 --> 08:18.019
were standard issue,
just available at any

08:18.062 --> 08:19.803
Army-Navy surplus store.

08:19.847 --> 08:22.806
But I found blood traces
on the chain link, not Ginny's.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.547
Tell me you got
a hit, Sebastian.
Yeah.

08:24.591 --> 08:27.724
This is Edward Lightell, drug
dealer and professional scumbag.

08:27.768 --> 08:28.899
He's currently on parole
for two counts

08:28.943 --> 08:30.684
of second-degree
sexual battery.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.337
Ginny wasn't sexually assaulted.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.688
Yeah, well, look at this creep.
It was just a matter of time.

08:34.731 --> 08:35.776
LASALLE:
We get an address?

08:35.819 --> 08:37.429
Yeah, a halfway house
in Metairie.

08:37.473 --> 08:38.692
But his P.O. says that

08:38.735 --> 08:39.997
Lightell's been missing
for days.

08:40.041 --> 08:42.522
However, I found his car
at a city impound lot.

08:42.565 --> 08:45.699
Get this. It was towed
this morning from a street

08:45.742 --> 08:47.875
in an abandoned part
of New Orleans East.

08:49.050 --> 08:50.878
I'll call Hannah.

08:57.711 --> 09:00.844
Pride, we just cleared
every house on the street

09:00.888 --> 09:03.020
where Lightell's car
was parked; we got nothing.

09:03.064 --> 09:03.934
Doesn't mean he's not

09:03.978 --> 09:05.109
hiding here somewhere.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.720
Okay, we'll expand
our search grid,

09:06.763 --> 09:07.895
keep going until we
find something.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.766
Any luck with Ginny?

09:10.854 --> 09:12.334
Not yet.

09:12.377 --> 09:13.553
But keep monitoring
our position

09:13.596 --> 09:14.815
in case that changes.

09:14.858 --> 09:16.381
Copy that.

09:16.425 --> 09:19.994
Feels like whole pieces
of my memory are just gone.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.909
Not gone, buried.

09:21.952 --> 09:25.216
One of the ways our subconscious
tries to protect us from trauma.

09:25.260 --> 09:29.656
You got to... dig through it
to get to the answers.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.571
You say that like you know
something about it.

09:31.614 --> 09:34.574
Well, maybe a little.

09:34.617 --> 09:36.750
So, what can I do
to dig the pieces out?

09:36.793 --> 09:39.579
I'm still trying to
figure that out for myself.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.147
Oh, my God.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.193
Ginny...

09:51.155 --> 09:52.722
I remember that face.

09:52.766 --> 09:55.638
What?I was definitely here.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.947
All right, look,

09:59.990 --> 10:02.123
take a deep breath.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.994
Block out the noise.

10:04.038 --> 10:07.128
Try to focus on everything
you were seeing

10:07.171 --> 10:08.608
and feeling in that moment.

10:13.221 --> 10:15.266
Through there.

10:25.189 --> 10:27.627
♪

10:27.670 --> 10:30.151
I came through that window.

10:30.194 --> 10:33.197
Somebody help!

10:33.241 --> 10:36.113
Okay, Ginny,

10:36.157 --> 10:37.854
listen to me,
I want you to go

10:37.898 --> 10:39.334
straight back to my car,

10:39.377 --> 10:41.249
all right?
I want you to

10:41.292 --> 10:43.338
lock the doors,
you understand me?

10:43.381 --> 10:45.645
Ginny, you
understand me?

10:45.688 --> 10:47.211
Yes.

10:47.255 --> 10:49.257
Okay, go, go.

10:52.782 --> 10:54.262
HANNAH :
Pride, any news?

10:54.305 --> 10:55.393
Yeah, we found it.

10:55.437 --> 10:57.178
Southwest corner
of Mitchum and Grant,

10:57.221 --> 10:59.310
white house, balcony.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.922
Copy that. We're on our way.

11:01.965 --> 11:03.663
I'm going in.

11:52.668 --> 11:55.236
I see you found
Edward Lightell.

11:55.279 --> 11:58.021
At least what's left of him.

12:15.169 --> 12:16.779
This is why
I hate Halloween.

12:16.823 --> 12:18.607
It's when all the freakiest
stuff happens around here.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.478
I can't stop thinking
about how lucky Ginny was.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.828
Yeah, well,
if she hadn't escaped,

12:21.871 --> 12:23.394
she might've ended up
gutted, too.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.092
HANNAH: Wade thinks
Lightell's been dead

12:25.135 --> 12:26.571
for at least 48 hours.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.399
All right, well, that clears him
of the kidnapping.

12:28.443 --> 12:30.401
He was a victim, too,
at least in this case.

12:30.445 --> 12:33.317
Puts us back to square one on
finding a suspect and a motive--

12:33.361 --> 12:35.929
doesn't seem like
sexual assault anymore.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.366
Ritualistic mutilation
really changes our profile.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.541
You thinking serial killer?

12:39.584 --> 12:41.108
Maybe, but there's
no obvious pattern.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.762
Ginny Young and Ed Lightell
couldn't be more different.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.328
HANNAH: So if we
find a connection,

12:44.372 --> 12:46.591
we may be able to anticipate
the next target.

12:46.635 --> 12:47.897
Yeah, might have something to do

12:47.941 --> 12:49.290
with these markings that
were painted on the, uh,

12:49.333 --> 12:51.596
crime scene walls.What are they?

12:51.640 --> 12:53.598
They're definitely
West African in origin,

12:53.642 --> 12:55.383
but there's at least
a dozen ancient religions

12:55.426 --> 12:56.863
with symbols like that.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.299
How do you know that?

12:58.342 --> 13:00.301
I studied anthropology
in college for a hot minute.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.827
I think our best bet is Vodun.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.002
What?

13:06.046 --> 13:08.526
Voodoo.
Ugh.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.180
It really is Halloween,
isn't it?

13:10.224 --> 13:12.966
Vodun is considerably
more peaceful

13:13.009 --> 13:14.881
than pop culture would
have us to believe.

13:14.924 --> 13:17.274
There is nothing peaceful
about human sacrifice.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.710
Yeah, well, if that's
what happened here.

13:18.754 --> 13:21.235
We need to consult
a local practitioner.

13:21.278 --> 13:22.540
Either of you know any?

13:26.849 --> 13:29.243
Why is it that you
never come to see me

13:29.286 --> 13:31.854
for a cup of tea or to catch up?

13:31.898 --> 13:33.856
It's only ever when
you think a Voodoo cult

13:33.900 --> 13:36.032
has brutally murdered
a poor, unsuspecting

13:36.076 --> 13:37.729
sailor or such.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.296
So these are Voodoo markings?

13:39.340 --> 13:41.864
No, not Voodoo,
Dwayne, Santeria.

13:41.908 --> 13:45.868
Well, they have a similar
origin and belief system.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.870
Santeria came to America
from Cuba and Mexico.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.917
Voodoo came from Haiti,
and none of them condone murder.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.919
Well, in this case,
we have the killing

13:52.962 --> 13:54.921
and desecration of a person,

13:54.964 --> 13:56.966
and these markings suggest

13:57.010 --> 13:58.576
a religious angle.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.970
These are not the work
of a true believer,

14:01.014 --> 14:03.538
just some nut who's
got his screws loose.

14:03.581 --> 14:05.801
And you knew that
before you came in here.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.370
So why are you really here?

14:09.413 --> 14:11.589
I was hoping that these

14:11.633 --> 14:13.200
symbols would help

14:13.243 --> 14:14.941
lead us to the suspect,
that's all.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.769
Appreciate your
time, Zaire.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.380
Well, not so fast,
Dwayne.

14:19.423 --> 14:22.035
Let's talk.
I'm fine.

14:22.078 --> 14:23.819
You're anything but fine.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.560
I could feel it off you

14:25.603 --> 14:28.868
the moment you walked in.
You've got trouble.

14:31.958 --> 14:35.004
Seems like you inherited more
than your grandmother's store.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.789
You get her sixth sense, too?

14:37.833 --> 14:39.966
I'm just observant.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.751
Big bag of pills,
it's never a good sign.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.449
Been through
a lot lately.

14:45.493 --> 14:48.278
Doctors say it's trauma.Sure.

14:48.322 --> 14:49.845
But there's more to it.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.586
You've experienced

14:51.629 --> 14:53.980
something most people
never even come close to.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.983
Yeah, I was shot
three times.
Not that part.

14:58.332 --> 15:01.117
You were on the other side.

15:01.161 --> 15:03.598
I never said any...

15:03.641 --> 15:04.991
It's written
all over you, Dwayne.

15:05.034 --> 15:08.124
And I can see that it
feels like a burden.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.955
Honestly?

15:12.999 --> 15:14.914
I'd just like
to be able to

15:14.957 --> 15:19.353
sleep without having visions.
These drugs can help.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.007
Maybe.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.010
But...

15:24.053 --> 15:27.578
if you brew this
tea before bed,

15:27.622 --> 15:28.971
I think it'll
do you better.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.364
It'll stop the visions?

15:30.407 --> 15:33.367
No, but it'll make it easier
to accept them.

15:36.239 --> 15:38.024
Thank you.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.852
He said in a placating tone.
Just try it, Dwayne.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.550
Yeah, maybe, Zaire, maybe.

15:42.593 --> 15:43.943
Okay.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.422
Oh, and tell
your brother,

15:45.466 --> 15:47.816
Jimmy, to come in.
I got something for him.

15:47.859 --> 15:51.167
How do you know that...Oh stop it, Dwayne.

15:51.211 --> 15:52.777
I am not psychic.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.127
He came in
the other day,

15:54.170 --> 15:55.650
introduced himself.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.130
Needed something
for his migraines.

16:17.106 --> 16:19.108
♪

16:26.986 --> 16:29.510
Autopsy already
done, Doc?
Ah.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.512
Our killer did most
of the heavy lifting.

16:31.555 --> 16:35.255
Emptied the chest cavity;
saved me some time.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.474
Emptied it?

16:37.518 --> 16:38.910
Like scooped everything out?

16:38.954 --> 16:41.348
All Mr. Lightell's vital organs
were removed.

16:41.391 --> 16:43.915
Heart, liver,
kidneys, lungs.

16:43.959 --> 16:48.050
But this was no butcher job;
the parts were harvested.

16:48.094 --> 16:50.792
Harvested?I know it may not
look like it,

16:50.835 --> 16:55.057
but all of the vessels
were ligated with precision,

16:55.101 --> 16:57.016
ensuring that
the organs

16:57.059 --> 16:58.800
remained intact.

16:58.843 --> 17:02.021
Whoever did this has
advanced medical training.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.371
Not some psychopath
just running around

17:04.414 --> 17:05.894
chopping folks up
for fun.

17:05.937 --> 17:08.897
Especially when you consider
that both Ginny Young

17:08.940 --> 17:11.073
and Ed Lightell had high doses

17:11.117 --> 17:12.640
of ketamine
in their system.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.685
Horse tranquilizer.Not only that,

17:14.729 --> 17:18.037
Lightell's toxicology
revealed traces

17:18.080 --> 17:20.039
of physostigma venenosum,

17:20.082 --> 17:22.867
known as the Calabar bean.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.087
Never heard of it.It's rare.

17:25.131 --> 17:28.003
It's indigenous
to Southeastern Nigeria.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.048
I'm guessing poisonous.

17:29.091 --> 17:30.571
Extremely,

17:30.614 --> 17:33.269
but in lower doses,

17:33.313 --> 17:34.836
it acts as a paralytic.

17:34.879 --> 17:36.185
Are you saying
someone

17:36.229 --> 17:39.101
took out his organs
while he was still alive?

17:39.145 --> 17:40.711
It would appear so.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.628
You said these Calabar beans
are rare.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.282
Especially in the States.

17:46.326 --> 17:48.415
Well, if we find out
how the killer got them,

17:48.458 --> 17:50.112
maybe we can find him.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.898
So there are three
Nigerian nurseries

17:53.942 --> 17:55.465
that export Calabar
all around the world.

17:55.509 --> 17:57.902
But since it's categorized
as a poisonous plant,

17:57.946 --> 18:00.079
FDA regulates importation
to the States.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.558
Who's licensed
to receive it?

18:01.602 --> 18:03.604
Pharmaceutical and
biomedical research labs.

18:03.647 --> 18:04.909
Customs has cleared
four shipments

18:04.953 --> 18:07.521
to the New Orleans area
in the last 12 months.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.523
Yeah, one of them went to
a medical research facility

18:09.566 --> 18:11.002
that shut down
three years ago.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.787
New Orleans Institute of Health.

18:12.830 --> 18:13.962
GREGORIO:
Courier says the package

18:14.005 --> 18:15.964
was signed for
by an Ignacio Marquez.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.139
What do we know about him?

18:17.183 --> 18:18.358
Only that he
immigrated here

18:18.401 --> 18:20.186
from Cuba last March
and that he never worked

18:20.229 --> 18:22.188
for the New Orleans
Institute of Health.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.974
Okay, call Lasalle,

18:26.017 --> 18:27.541
tell him to meet us at
that research facility.

18:36.506 --> 18:38.639
I checked the perimeter.
No sign of movement.

18:38.682 --> 18:41.294
Entergy says the power's been
cut off to the whole building.

18:41.337 --> 18:43.122
Hmm? Wait, you're
telling me I have to go

18:43.165 --> 18:45.298
into Dracula's castle
in the dark?

18:45.341 --> 18:47.430
You want me to hold
your little hand?

18:47.474 --> 18:49.432
You touch me, Sebastian,
I'll shoot you.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.479
Come on.

18:58.746 --> 18:59.964
This place is huge.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.531
Let's split up.
Teams of two.

19:01.575 --> 19:04.404
Sebastian, you're with me.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.552
You all right?

19:22.596 --> 19:24.641
No! We're in the creepiest
building in the world

19:24.685 --> 19:25.773
searching for a
freak who likes

19:25.816 --> 19:28.558
to cut people up.
Do I look all right?

19:28.602 --> 19:30.081
Come on.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.765
NCIS!Don't move!

20:01.809 --> 20:04.290
Get your hands up. Turn around.

20:07.510 --> 20:09.208
Drop it.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.040
Go!

20:16.084 --> 20:17.216
Call for backup!

20:18.391 --> 20:20.393
NCIS! Stop!

20:21.437 --> 20:24.440
Marquez! On your knees.

20:24.484 --> 20:26.486
Don't do it!

20:26.529 --> 20:27.617
Stop!

20:32.796 --> 20:34.798
Go, go check on Sebastian, go.

20:36.626 --> 20:39.063
Sebastian.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.282
Paramedics are on the way,
but it's too late.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.718
I can't find a pulse.

20:43.154 --> 20:44.808
You sure?Yeah, I'm positive.

20:56.603 --> 20:57.952
LASALLE: The vic on the table,
Daniel York,

20:57.995 --> 21:00.084
is an accountant
at St. Tammany Parish.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.564
Reported missing four days ago.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.392
Yeah, and he was dead.
I was sure of it.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.307
According to Doc Wade,
he was dosed heavily

21:05.351 --> 21:07.483
with Calabar beans.
It slowed York's pulse.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.790
Mine almost stopped
when he sat up.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.574
Gregorio's, too.

21:11.618 --> 21:13.141
Think she's pissed at me?

21:13.184 --> 21:15.883
"Pissed" would be an
understatement, Sebastian.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.667
But the good news is,

21:17.711 --> 21:19.974
York's out of surgery
and expected to survive.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.584
Yeah, well, the bad news
is our suspect got away,

21:21.628 --> 21:23.586
he could grab somebody else.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.501
We need to figure
out his pattern

21:25.545 --> 21:27.198
and stop him before he does.We got an accountant

21:27.242 --> 21:28.374
from St. Tammany,

21:28.417 --> 21:29.679
Pride's assistant Ginny

21:29.723 --> 21:31.333
and sexual predator
Lightell

21:31.377 --> 21:33.683
all abducted
by Ignacio Marquez. Why?

21:33.727 --> 21:36.512
Other than he likes to play
real

21:36.556 --> 21:38.732
Actually, Marquez is
a doctor.

21:38.775 --> 21:42.213
U.S. embassy in Havana gave me a
full background on our suspect.

21:42.257 --> 21:45.347
Resident at
the Hospital de Curación

21:45.391 --> 21:47.044
in Santiago, that is,
until he was fired

21:47.088 --> 21:50.657
for performing unnecessary
procedures on mental patients.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.876
Oh, okay, so he's legit crazy.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.835
Spoke to a santero
from a local Santeria house

21:54.878 --> 21:56.358
where Marquez was a member.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.491
Got banned for being
too extreme.

21:58.534 --> 21:59.753
Extreme how?

21:59.796 --> 22:01.842
Organizing animal sacrifice.

22:01.885 --> 22:03.365
He wanted to be part
of this blood ritual,

22:03.409 --> 22:06.063
showed up with a gallon of
human blood to the service,

22:06.107 --> 22:07.848
was forcibly removed.

22:07.891 --> 22:09.893
Man, that's creepy,
even for New Orleans.

22:09.937 --> 22:11.895
Yeah, but there is a method
to his madness.

22:11.939 --> 22:13.636
Those Calabar beans he purchased
were not cheap.

22:13.680 --> 22:16.335
And that medical equipment he's
using is top of the line, too.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.293
This guy's flush with cash.
Where'd he get it?

22:18.337 --> 22:19.686
Well, not from
practicing medicine.

22:19.729 --> 22:21.731
Works nights as a janitor.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.691
For a company that specializes
in disposing of medical waste.

22:24.734 --> 22:28.303
Well, that gives him
access to hospitals,

22:28.347 --> 22:30.261
research labs, universities.

22:30.305 --> 22:31.741
GREGORIO: And
transplant facilities.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.874
Big business
in black market organs.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.092
LASALLE: Yeah,
but transplants are regulated

22:35.136 --> 22:36.964
by UNOS.

22:37.007 --> 22:40.097
But tissue recovery
for medical research is not.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.360
If the organs are

22:41.403 --> 22:42.883
no longer viable,

22:42.926 --> 22:44.711
they can be
legally donated or sold.

22:44.754 --> 22:46.756
Well, that could explain how
Marquez is making his money.

22:46.800 --> 22:47.844
Research labs will pay

22:47.888 --> 22:50.238
big bucks for human parts.

22:50.281 --> 22:53.067
Am I the only one completely
disturbed by that statement?

22:53.110 --> 22:54.285
LASALLE: Well,
it's not about religion

22:54.329 --> 22:56.244
for Marquez,
it's about greed.

22:56.287 --> 22:57.941
Okay, I'm happy
to moderate this debate,

22:57.985 --> 22:59.769
but after we catch him.

23:03.773 --> 23:06.254
Ah, good timing, Dwayne.

23:06.297 --> 23:07.908
Hannah will be here
any moment for my findings

23:07.951 --> 23:10.911
on Lightell's autopsy.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.175
But that's not why you're here.

23:14.218 --> 23:16.090
Why else would I be here?

23:16.133 --> 23:18.048
Oh, I imagine
you're about to tell me.

23:18.092 --> 23:21.791
You remember Akia Dupre?

23:21.835 --> 23:24.838
Owned the spiritualist shop
next to the Trutone?

23:24.881 --> 23:26.013
Died last year.

23:26.056 --> 23:27.275
Granddaughter Zaire

23:27.318 --> 23:28.755
is running the place now.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.452
She's turned it into a cafe.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.932
She gave me some...

23:32.889 --> 23:34.456
...special tea.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.763
Want me to tell you
what's in it?

23:36.806 --> 23:38.721
If it's not too much trouble.

23:38.765 --> 23:40.767
Not at all.

23:40.810 --> 23:44.335
Tell me the rest.
Let's skip the denials.

23:46.468 --> 23:50.733
I'm still experiencing things
I can't explain.

23:50.777 --> 23:53.867
Yes, you went to the doctor.
What did Calvin say?

23:53.910 --> 23:55.521
That there was nothing
wrong with me.

23:55.564 --> 23:56.913
At least not physical.

23:56.957 --> 23:59.873
He prescribed some pills
to help deal with the rest.

23:59.916 --> 24:01.918
Doesn't he know how you feel
about pharmaceuticals?

24:01.962 --> 24:05.792
You know I'm not gonna
take them, but...

24:05.835 --> 24:08.403
I need to sleep, Loretta.

24:08.447 --> 24:10.144
And the tea's supposed to help?

24:10.187 --> 24:14.322
Yeah. But not by covering up
the symptoms.

24:14.365 --> 24:15.976
Zaire says
it'll help me

24:16.019 --> 24:18.195
accept what's happening.I may be a doctor,

24:18.239 --> 24:20.197
but I know firsthand

24:20.241 --> 24:23.113
that science doesn't
always have the answer.

24:23.157 --> 24:24.898
Sometimes the
only way to find

24:24.941 --> 24:28.989
what you seek is to travel
the alternate path.

24:31.382 --> 24:32.993
Sorry.

24:33.036 --> 24:35.517
Am I interrupting?

24:35.561 --> 24:39.565
No. The show's just
about to start.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.958
It's a skin sample
of Edward Lightell's abdomen.

24:42.002 --> 24:45.222
And while examining it,
I found this puncture wound.

24:45.266 --> 24:47.268
Looks like an injection site.

24:47.311 --> 24:48.922
Well, based on location,
I'd say more likely

24:48.965 --> 24:51.620
a percutaneous liver biopsy.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.230
Why is that significant?

24:53.274 --> 24:55.537
Because I confirmed the presence
of similar puncture wounds

24:55.581 --> 24:58.279
in both Daniel York and Ginny.

24:58.322 --> 25:00.150
And that's not the only thing
they have in common.

25:00.194 --> 25:04.633
All three of them,
blood type O negative.

25:04.677 --> 25:09.159
Marquez has been searching
for a specific liver.

25:09.203 --> 25:10.944
That's why he
keeps his victims alive

25:10.987 --> 25:12.249
while he's trying to find it.

25:12.293 --> 25:13.903
WADE:
He needs the liver

25:13.947 --> 25:19.169
to stay viable because he needs
it for a live transplant.

25:19.213 --> 25:21.563
Marquez works for a
medical waste company.

25:21.607 --> 25:23.957
Cane Transplant Center is one
of their biggest clients.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.524
And one of the only facilities
in the city

25:25.567 --> 25:29.266
that would have a need
for a viable human liver.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.529
Worth paying them a visit.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.226
I'll have Gregorio
meet me there.

25:33.836 --> 25:35.925
You're not gonna go with her?

25:35.969 --> 25:37.927
No, she's got it handled.

25:37.971 --> 25:40.103
I think I'm gonna
check on Ginny.

25:40.147 --> 25:41.670
If Marquez still
hasn't found

25:41.714 --> 25:43.498
what he's looking for,

25:43.542 --> 25:46.762
Ginny could still be in danger.

25:49.069 --> 25:51.158
Thank you. Hey.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.987
Hey.Nurse says Marquez picks up the
medical waste two nights a week.

25:54.030 --> 25:55.945
No contact with staff.Well, someone here

25:55.989 --> 25:58.078
has to know him.And that someone would be me.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.470
I heard you ladies were
asking about Ignacio?

25:59.514 --> 26:01.037
Federal agents, actually.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.778
I'm Special Agent Khoury.

26:02.822 --> 26:04.388
This is Special
Agent Gregorio.

26:04.432 --> 26:06.913
Anything you can tell us
would be helpful.

26:06.956 --> 26:08.523
Not much to tell.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.178
Uh, we shoot the breeze.
We're both big soccer fans.

26:11.221 --> 26:12.788
He, uh, seems like a decent guy.

26:12.832 --> 26:14.398
When's the last time
he was here?

26:14.442 --> 26:16.270
I don't know. Maybe a week ago?

26:16.313 --> 26:17.880
Sorry

26:17.924 --> 26:19.099
DR. FRANCIS: Brent,
can we finish these

26:19.142 --> 26:20.535
post-op reports
so I can get out of here?

26:20.579 --> 26:22.145
Susan, these guys
are federal agents.

26:22.189 --> 26:24.626
They're asking about Ignacio.

26:24.670 --> 26:27.107
Oh, yeah. Nice guy.

26:27.150 --> 26:28.674
He do something?

26:28.717 --> 26:29.936
DR. STOKELY: Susan
and I are fellows,

26:29.979 --> 26:31.894
which means we get
all the paperwork.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.069
And are the only other ones here

26:33.113 --> 26:34.680
late at night
when Ignacio comes by.

26:34.723 --> 26:37.073
But tonight might be an
exception if we can wrap it up.

26:37.117 --> 26:39.423
HANNAH: Oh, we won't keep you
long, maybe we can

26:39.467 --> 26:42.122
just grab a coffee and...Fellows don't drink coffee.

26:42.165 --> 26:43.950
At least,
not my fellows.

26:43.993 --> 26:46.082
Thank you, doctors,
you're relieved.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.738
I'm Vincent Welles,

26:49.782 --> 26:52.306
chief of surgery. The nurses
told me you had some questions.

26:52.349 --> 26:53.786
We do.

26:53.829 --> 26:55.657
Unfortunately,
I can't answer them,

26:55.701 --> 26:58.181
as I'm sure you're aware
of HIPAA laws.

26:58.225 --> 27:01.141
Nobody's asking you to violate
confidentiality, Doctor.

27:01.184 --> 27:02.142
Why don't you at least
hear the questions

27:02.185 --> 27:04.187
before you stonewall us?

27:04.231 --> 27:05.798
Because my next 18 hours
are booked

27:05.841 --> 27:07.234
with back-to-back surgeries.

27:07.277 --> 27:09.802
You know, life-and-death stuff.

27:09.845 --> 27:10.759
One of your vendors
is responsible

27:10.803 --> 27:12.021
for multiple abductions

27:12.065 --> 27:13.806
and at least one violent murder.

27:13.849 --> 27:16.852
Also life-and-death stuff.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.637
Ignacio Marquez might be
trying to sell donor livers

27:18.680 --> 27:19.855
to one of your patients.

27:19.899 --> 27:21.640
That's absurd.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.424
The allocation
and distribution

27:23.467 --> 27:24.686
of human organs

27:24.730 --> 27:27.123
is the most regulated area
of health care.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.559
And yet, people
are still paying

27:28.603 --> 27:32.476
up to 150 grand for a single
black market liver.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.436
Even if one of our patients did
secure a liver illegally,

27:35.479 --> 27:38.569
I would never allow it to be
transplanted in my clinic.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.267
I respect
your conviction, Doctor,

27:40.310 --> 27:42.095
but there's a dangerous man
on the loose,

27:42.138 --> 27:44.140
and something in your records
may help us find him.

27:44.184 --> 27:47.056
The only way you're seeing those
records is with a court order.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.102
Oh, well, good
thing I stopped

27:49.145 --> 27:51.147
on the way, to get one.

27:57.327 --> 28:00.069
LASALLE:
Thanks for the update, Sergeant.

28:00.113 --> 28:02.115
We got BOLOs out
at a dozen jurisdictions

28:02.158 --> 28:04.247
and still no sign of Marquez.

28:04.291 --> 28:06.162
Well, I just scoured
the Cane Transplant database.

28:06.206 --> 28:07.729
I think I figured out
how Marquez

28:07.773 --> 28:09.296
has been identifying
his victims.

28:09.339 --> 28:11.690
So Ginny, Lightell
and York

28:11.733 --> 28:13.735
were all registered
as possible organ donors.

28:13.779 --> 28:14.867
All their personal information

28:14.910 --> 28:15.998
is listed here
for Marquez to see.

28:16.042 --> 28:18.000
Well, he was
an outside contractor.

28:18.044 --> 28:19.785
How did he get access
to the database?

28:19.828 --> 28:21.090
It could be somebody
on the inside.

28:21.134 --> 28:22.265
I'll run background
on all the employees

28:22.309 --> 28:23.789
who had access to the files.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.312
I'll also review
Cane's security footage,

28:25.355 --> 28:27.357
see who had contact
with our suspect.

28:27.401 --> 28:28.750
All right, I'll
cross-reference the patients

28:28.794 --> 28:30.621
waiting for a transplant.

28:30.665 --> 28:35.235
One of them may have been trying
to jump their place in line.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.628
Chris, there are at least
a dozen names on here

28:37.672 --> 28:40.196
that have similar donor
characteristics to our victims.

28:40.240 --> 28:43.025
I'll have the marshals put them
in protective custody.

28:43.069 --> 28:46.115
Until we find Marquez,
none of them are safe.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.433
Ginny, it's Dwayne.

28:59.476 --> 29:01.914
I come bearing lunch.

29:04.133 --> 29:06.048
Ginny?

29:45.740 --> 29:47.133
:
Ginny.

29:47.176 --> 29:49.918
All right. Wake up. Ginny.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.964
Hey. You need to stay awake,
all right?

29:52.007 --> 29:54.183
Wake up. Ginnny,
we need to get out of here.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.794
Ginny.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.100
What...?

29:58.144 --> 29:59.798
No, no.

29:59.841 --> 30:02.191
Stay right there.No... no, Ginny.

30:20.079 --> 30:22.037
Now how do you feel?

30:22.081 --> 30:25.649
Like I've been run over
by a streetcar, twice.

30:25.693 --> 30:28.261
Well, the naloxone should
counteract the effects

30:28.304 --> 30:30.263
of whatever he
injected you with.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.700
But it'll take
a little time to work.

30:32.743 --> 30:35.442
Marquez took Ginny
in broad daylight.

30:35.485 --> 30:37.618
He's reckless
and desperate,

30:37.661 --> 30:39.838
and knows we're after him.
We are all out of time.

30:39.881 --> 30:41.056
No, Hannah and the
team are doing

30:41.100 --> 30:42.710
whatever they can to locate him.

30:42.753 --> 30:46.496
I just... should have known
this was gonna happen.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.890
He got the drop on you, Dwayne.No.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.937
Before that. I saw the signs.

30:51.980 --> 30:53.721
The rock doves.

30:53.764 --> 30:56.202
I-I just didn't understand
what they meant.

30:56.245 --> 30:59.248
Could you give us
a moment, please?Yes, ma'am.

31:02.686 --> 31:05.428
So what is it that
you didn't understand?

31:05.472 --> 31:07.996
It was a warning.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.346
That Ginny was in trouble.

31:10.390 --> 31:12.131
Because of some doves?

31:12.174 --> 31:14.655
When you say it like that,
it makes me sound like...

31:14.698 --> 31:17.005
No, you're a lot of
things, Dwayne Pride,

31:17.049 --> 31:18.877
but crazy isn't one of them.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.226
It's called intuition.

31:20.269 --> 31:22.010
Years of experience on the job.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.533
A sixth sense.
No.

31:23.577 --> 31:25.666
No. This was something else.

31:31.063 --> 31:33.979
Hannah, please tell me
you found Ginny.

31:34.022 --> 31:35.806
No, not yet, but a neighbor did
see Marquez loading her

31:35.850 --> 31:37.199
into a black Toyota.

31:37.243 --> 31:40.159
We got three agencies assisting
with the manhunt.

31:40.202 --> 31:41.769
Well, he came after Ginny twice.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.684
She must have the liver
that he needs.

31:43.727 --> 31:45.077
Yeah, and whoever
he needs it for

31:45.120 --> 31:46.426
probably can't wait much longer.

31:46.469 --> 31:49.124
We need to track down
every doctor in this area

31:49.168 --> 31:51.300
who has the training required
to perform the transplant.

31:51.344 --> 31:53.955
Well, I would ask Dr. Welles
for a list, but after

31:53.999 --> 31:55.478
our last conversation,
I doubt he'd cooperate.

31:55.522 --> 31:58.220
Well, I'm not gonna
give him a choice.

31:58.264 --> 31:59.569
I'll drive.

32:00.701 --> 32:02.094
I'm fine, Loretta.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.269
I'm fine, I'm fi...

32:03.312 --> 32:05.271
Dwayne.

32:05.314 --> 32:07.534
Give me your keys, Dwayne.

32:07.577 --> 32:11.930
If you're nice, maybe I'll
let you pick the music.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.543
Hey. Check this out.

32:16.586 --> 32:19.111
I've gone through 500 patients'
files, and only one of them

32:19.154 --> 32:21.896
was incomplete: Skylar Samms.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.116
Well, what's missing?We got an address,

32:24.159 --> 32:25.987
phone number, fake social,

32:26.031 --> 32:28.990
but no photo, medical history
or insurance records.

32:29.034 --> 32:30.035
You run the address?

32:30.078 --> 32:31.732
Defunct auto parts store
in Lakeview.

32:31.775 --> 32:33.212
I even checked with the DMV.

32:33.255 --> 32:34.300
There's no records
of her at all.

32:34.343 --> 32:35.997
Huh.

32:36.041 --> 32:37.738
Well, it sounds like
Skylar Samms is an alias.

32:37.781 --> 32:41.002
I do have a surgeon's reference:
Vincent Welles.

32:41.046 --> 32:44.005
He ordered a full battery of
pre-op diagnostics a week ago.

32:44.049 --> 32:45.354
I don't get it.

32:45.398 --> 32:46.921
Why would the chief of surgery
want to conceal

32:46.965 --> 32:48.705
his patient's identity?

32:48.749 --> 32:50.185
Because he doesn't want anybody
to know he's implanting

32:50.229 --> 32:51.665
a black market liver.

32:54.059 --> 32:57.018
We want to find Ginny Young, we
need to identify Skylar Samms.

32:57.062 --> 33:00.500
I'm open to suggestions.

33:00.543 --> 33:03.024
What was the date and time
of her last pre

33:03.068 --> 33:05.722
Tuesday, 4:30 a.m.

33:05.766 --> 33:07.637
When nobody else was around.Yeah,

33:07.681 --> 33:10.423
except the all-seeing eye

33:10.466 --> 33:11.946
in the sky.

33:11.990 --> 33:15.950
There she is.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.691
Say hello to Skylar Samms.

33:17.734 --> 33:19.998
I know that girl.

33:23.871 --> 33:26.482
Excuse me. Federal agent.

33:26.526 --> 33:28.310
We need to speak
with Dr. Welles right away.

33:28.354 --> 33:30.747
I'm sorry. He's already
left for the evening.

33:30.791 --> 33:32.445
Are you sure?
Can you check again?

33:32.488 --> 33:35.187
I saw him walk out
a few hours ago, but...

33:36.101 --> 33:38.451
That's strange.

33:38.494 --> 33:40.496
Key card log says
he's still in the building.

33:44.935 --> 33:46.111
What do you got?

33:46.154 --> 33:47.982
HANNAH :
The name of the patient

33:48.026 --> 33:51.029
waiting for Ginny's liver
is Dr. Susan Francis.

33:51.072 --> 33:52.247
Doctor?

33:52.291 --> 33:53.988
Yeah. Tammy and I met her.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.164
She's a fellow
at the transplant center.

33:56.208 --> 33:57.687
Francis got a donor liver
a few years back,

33:57.731 --> 33:59.167
but had complications.

33:59.211 --> 34:02.040
So she hired Marquez
to find a new one?

34:02.083 --> 34:03.563
The other fellow,

34:03.606 --> 34:06.087
Brent Stokely, created
a false patient profile.

34:06.131 --> 34:07.915
The two have been dating
since med school.

34:07.958 --> 34:09.090
What about Welles?

34:09.134 --> 34:10.744
Why would he risk
everything to help them?

34:10.787 --> 34:12.224
I'm not sure
that he is helping them.

34:12.267 --> 34:14.226
At least, not by choice.

34:14.269 --> 34:16.097
There's a good chance
Welles's signature was forged

34:16.141 --> 34:18.230
on Francis's pre-op orders.

34:18.273 --> 34:21.581
Can Stokely do the surgery
by himself?

34:21.624 --> 34:24.018
According to the experts
I spoke to, no.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.891
All right, I think the operation
is happening right here and now.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.676
Send backup.Okay.

34:29.719 --> 34:32.374
Excuse me. You need to take us
to the operating rooms.

34:32.418 --> 34:35.160
Right now.I can't. I'm-I'm not authorized.

34:35.203 --> 34:38.119
Listen...Dwayne. This way.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.213
Dwayne, over here.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.611
PRIDE: They're operating on
Susan and Ginny.

34:53.961 --> 34:55.180
Stay here.

34:55.223 --> 34:56.790
Welles, Stokely,

34:56.833 --> 34:58.922
you stop what you're doing
right now.

34:58.966 --> 35:00.794
I can't.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.491
He's forcing me.

35:11.631 --> 35:13.023
Loretta.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.373
:
Oh, God.

35:15.548 --> 35:18.464
Stokely, step away from Ginny

35:18.507 --> 35:19.552
and put down the scalpel.

35:19.595 --> 35:20.901
Or what

35:20.944 --> 35:22.120
If my hand slips
even the slightest bit,

35:22.163 --> 35:23.556
I'll nick the abdominal aorta

35:23.599 --> 35:25.297
and the patient will bleed out
in 60 seconds.

35:25.340 --> 35:26.428
He's right, Dwayne.

35:26.472 --> 35:29.170
Now hang tight
while I save Susan,

35:29.214 --> 35:31.259
or they both die.

35:46.796 --> 35:49.799
PRIDE: Ginny doesn't
deserve this, Stokely.

35:49.843 --> 35:53.760
Whatever you think can be
gained here, you're wrong.

35:53.803 --> 35:55.283
Don't let anyone else get hurt.

35:55.327 --> 35:57.111
Keep quiet.
I'm trying to concentrate.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.939
Brent, this is insane.If you had helped her
from the beginning,

35:58.982 --> 36:00.897
none of this would be happening.I tried.

36:00.941 --> 36:02.464
You made one phone call.
That's all.

36:02.508 --> 36:04.684
UNOS denied her status.
What more could I have done?

36:04.727 --> 36:06.773
They shouldn't get to decide
who lives and dies.

36:06.816 --> 36:10.951
Isn't that what you're doing?
Choosing one life over another?

36:10.994 --> 36:13.083
DR. STOKELY:
Susan is a brilliant doctor.

36:13.127 --> 36:14.781
Her survival will benefit
hundreds of patients.

36:14.824 --> 36:16.783
Not this way it won't.

36:16.826 --> 36:18.350
Her medical
career is over.

36:18.393 --> 36:19.786
And so is yours.

36:19.829 --> 36:20.917
Either way, she lives.

36:20.961 --> 36:22.223
It's a price
I'm willing to pay.

36:22.267 --> 36:25.748
Now back off.

36:27.010 --> 36:29.317
Susan's heart rate's dropping.

36:31.406 --> 36:32.625
She's crashing.

36:32.668 --> 36:33.626
What did you do to her?

36:34.844 --> 36:37.891
Her body was too weak, Brent.

36:38.892 --> 36:41.416
I'm so sorry.

36:43.723 --> 36:46.204
Get out of my way. Susan?

36:47.422 --> 36:48.945
She's gone.

36:50.991 --> 36:52.122
No!
Ah!

36:53.994 --> 36:55.430
WADE:
You okay?

36:55.474 --> 36:56.866
Yeah.
DR. WELLES:
Ginny's crashing.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.825
He's already bisected
the portal vein.

36:58.868 --> 37:00.609
NURSE: Doctor, your arm.I'll be fine.

37:00.653 --> 37:02.307
Keep the lap pads coming.

37:02.350 --> 37:05.048
Prep for a lateral venorrhaphy.
It's our only chance.

37:05.092 --> 37:06.963
She's bleeding out, Doctor.

37:07.007 --> 37:08.922
DR. WELLES:
Come on, Ginny.

37:08.965 --> 37:10.315
Hang on, hang on.

37:10.358 --> 37:11.620
We're losing her.

37:11.664 --> 37:13.535
:
We're losing her.

37:22.979 --> 37:26.461
Knock, knock.

37:28.028 --> 37:29.682
Special Agent Pride.

37:29.725 --> 37:32.772
We've faced death together
at least twice.

37:32.815 --> 37:34.687
Think you can
call me Dwayne now.

37:36.993 --> 37:39.779
Heard you took a victory lap
around the floor.

37:39.822 --> 37:41.650
Two, actually.

37:42.912 --> 37:45.219
I'll be back to work
in no time.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.352
Hey, the last thing
you need to do

37:47.395 --> 37:49.354
is push yourself too hard.

37:49.397 --> 37:51.269
I speak from experience.

37:52.835 --> 37:55.316
How can I ever repay
what you did for me?

37:55.360 --> 37:57.318
By getting better.

37:57.362 --> 37:59.799
And putting all of this
behind you.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.540
You make that sound easy.

38:01.583 --> 38:03.237
Well, God knows it isn't.

38:03.281 --> 38:07.807
But I'm learning there's
no reason to look back

38:07.850 --> 38:11.245
unless you're planning
on going that way.

38:11.289 --> 38:16.816
I promise you, I have
no intention of doing that.

38:16.859 --> 38:19.035
Me, neither.

38:22.212 --> 38:26.042
Lemongrass,
pomegranate flowers

38:26.086 --> 38:27.957
and goji berries.

38:28.001 --> 38:30.308
It's all natural,
no magic.

38:30.351 --> 38:31.874
I had it analyzed.

38:31.918 --> 38:33.876
Good work, Detective.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.357
But I'm pretty sure
you missed the point.

38:36.401 --> 38:40.056
You want me to abandon
all logic...

38:40.100 --> 38:43.582
I want you to accept
that some mysteries

38:43.625 --> 38:45.497
are not meant to be solved.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.194
That's just not easy
for someone like me.

38:47.237 --> 38:49.501
Even more reason to take
a leap of faith.

38:49.544 --> 38:51.154
Trust that the
universe will provide

38:51.198 --> 38:52.939
everything that
you need.

38:54.244 --> 38:56.769
And what you need
the most right now...

38:57.987 --> 38:59.815
...is to get some rest.

39:08.911 --> 39:11.610
Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne.

39:11.653 --> 39:14.003
SEBASTIAN:
Hannah, will you tell her

39:14.047 --> 39:16.179
that she's got to put
the ears on, please?

39:16.223 --> 39:17.964
Wow.

39:18.007 --> 39:19.313
I thought you hated Halloween.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.359
She's had a bit of
a change of heart.

39:21.402 --> 39:23.404
I did not. I still hate it.

39:23.448 --> 39:24.971
Well, why are you going
out with me, then?

39:25.014 --> 39:26.929
Because I owe you, for scaring
the living crap out of me

39:26.973 --> 39:28.931
at that abandoned lab,
and because

39:28.975 --> 39:30.411
payback's a bitch, right?

39:30.455 --> 39:32.413
I got a plan
to get him back.Okay, all right.

39:32.457 --> 39:34.241
That's fine. This is gonna be
the worst Halloween of my life.

39:34.284 --> 39:35.503
You're welcome to join.

39:35.547 --> 39:37.026
Maybe next time.

39:37.070 --> 39:39.072
I'm actually, I think
I'm gonna chill out here.

39:39.115 --> 39:40.378
I was gonna watch a--
maybe a movie...

39:40.421 --> 39:42.728
Oh, Sebastian,
put the damn ears back on

39:42.771 --> 39:43.990
and move your tail.

39:45.774 --> 39:48.037
Night, Hannah.

39:48.081 --> 39:49.125
Meow.

39:49.169 --> 39:51.606
Meow.

39:51.650 --> 39:54.653
CHILDREN:
Trick or treat!
