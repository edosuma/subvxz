WEBVTT

00:06.298 --> 00:08.634
I understand
we all have busy lives.

00:08.717 --> 00:12.095
Sometimes you miss an episode
for the little things in life,

00:12.179 --> 00:13.388
like a heart transplant

00:13.472 --> 00:15.057
or a multiple murder
in the family,

00:15.140 --> 00:18.644
but there should
be no damn reason on Earth

00:18.727 --> 00:20.729
that I have to tell you
what you missed last week

00:20.812 --> 00:22.064
on "Shameless."

00:22.147 --> 00:24.066
Hmm.

00:24.149 --> 00:26.026
Do we really need
a piece of paper

00:26.109 --> 00:27.778
from the state
to say that I'm committed?

00:27.861 --> 00:28.737
I'm committed.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.656
Maybe one day I will want
to get married,

00:30.739 --> 00:32.991
but in the meantime,
I love you.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.701
I'm not saying never.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.870
No, you're saying
you don't love me enough now.

00:38.000 --> 00:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.926 --> 00:52.719
Can I impose on you
to do me a favor?

00:52.803 --> 00:54.763
‐ Of course. What?
‐ Great.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.932
Um, can you pick Julia up
after school?

00:57.015 --> 00:59.351
‐ Julia?
‐ My kid.

00:59.434 --> 01:02.062
I decided you might just
be interesting after all.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.401
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.111
That was not cool.

01:13.365 --> 01:16.868
Let's just say you are
overqualified for this group.

01:16.952 --> 01:19.288
I think I've got somewhere
better suited for your talent.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.455
The academy, sir?

01:20.539 --> 01:22.624
How do you feel about trash?

01:22.708 --> 01:26.211
Now that you remember exactly
how you destroyed Kyle's life,

01:26.295 --> 01:28.171
I can get on with
making you pay for it.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.257
Filling me full of Oxy?

01:30.340 --> 01:33.302
Mm, I need you
in an opioid coma,

01:33.385 --> 01:35.929
but not, you know, dead.

Sir, step out
of the car.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.765
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:43.849 --> 03:46.685
Hey.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.562
Tami.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.189
Tam. Tami, Tami, here,
it's your phone.

03:52.357 --> 03:54.484
Hey. Hey.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.777
Hey, handsome.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.446
Oh, good morning.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.614
Ah.

03:59.698 --> 04:00.907
What's the emergency?

04:00.991 --> 04:02.117
Salon run out
of hair dye?

04:02.200 --> 04:06.079
No, it's my family
group text.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.290
Dad wants us home
for a family meeting.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.916
"Us," like you
and your sisters?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.836
"Us," like you, too.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.380
You're a baby daddy,
so you're a Tamietti now.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.007
Oh.

04:17.089 --> 04:19.050
You're going.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.180
Do‐do‐do‐do‐do‐do.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.559
Here you go.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.685
‐ An omelet with...
‐ Oh.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.479
Asparagus, mushrooms,

04:30.562 --> 04:31.980
and cheese from a goat.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.316
Sounds weird, but it's
actually pretty good.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.067
You're amazing.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.819
It's just an omelet.

04:37.903 --> 04:40.030
It's beautiful.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.656
You're beautiful.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.993
I love having you around.

04:45.076 --> 04:47.621
I love being around.

04:47.704 --> 04:48.872
Gonna hop in the shower.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.332
Sounds good, honey.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.962
Mmm.

04:58.882 --> 05:00.801
Uh, I'm gonna go
call home real quick,

05:00.884 --> 05:01.760
just to check on Franny.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.220
‐ Okay.
‐ Be right back.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.303
Okay.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.572
Jesus Christ.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.533
You're never gonna fix
the fucking thing, Byron.

05:24.616 --> 05:27.536
No one that rides a Vespa
can fix anything.

05:27.619 --> 05:30.372
Something happen to your
little bike thingy?

05:30.455 --> 05:31.456
Yeah.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.791
It's a Vespa, and...

05:32.874 --> 05:34.543
it stopped working
all of a sudden.

05:34.626 --> 05:35.585
Oh, weird.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.795
What the hell
are you doing here?

05:36.878 --> 05:38.213
I came to drop off
some of the stuff

05:38.296 --> 05:40.131
you left at my place.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.049
That it?

05:41.132 --> 05:42.759
And I was hoping
that we could talk.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.053
In private.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.555
You know, anything
you got to say to me,

05:46.638 --> 05:50.141
you can say in front of the...
love of my life, Byron.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.061
Mickey.

05:56.398 --> 05:57.440
Okay.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.819
‐ It was a mistake coming.
‐ Yeah.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.281
Hey, Ian,

06:04.364 --> 06:06.449
you want to come check out
a show tomorrow?

06:06.533 --> 06:07.742
Jesus Christ.

06:07.826 --> 06:08.910
Read the fucking room, Byron.

06:08.994 --> 06:12.080
‐ Show?
‐ Yeah.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.583
It's the Imperial Mammoth.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.959
I don't know if you've
heard about them.

06:16.042 --> 06:18.712
They're‐‐they're, like,
my favorite band right now.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.423
Wait. Wait, yeah, yeah.

06:21.506 --> 06:24.009
They're the, uh,
the hipster shit

06:24.092 --> 06:26.386
with the suspenders
and the‐‐the harp

06:26.469 --> 06:27.888
and all that, huh?

06:27.971 --> 06:29.264
Yeah, you're going to that?

06:29.347 --> 06:31.474
I can get you
on the list, too.

06:31.558 --> 06:33.643
I mean, I don't know if you
need a plus‐one or whatever‐‐

06:33.727 --> 06:35.353
Nah, no.
He don't need a plus‐one.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.148
Trust me, he's got a lot
of, uh, what'd you say,

06:38.231 --> 06:39.858
"personal work"
you needed to do

06:39.941 --> 06:42.485
before you'd be ready
to play the field?

06:43.528 --> 06:45.155
No. No.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.533
Uh, actually,

06:48.617 --> 06:50.327
I just took a page
out of your playbook

06:50.410 --> 06:52.662
and attached myself to
the first swinging dick I saw.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.873
We barely know each other,
but, pfft...

06:54.956 --> 06:57.125
man, it has been
a fairy tale so far.

06:57.208 --> 06:57.792
It's actually
why I came here

06:57.876 --> 06:59.961
is, uh...

07:00.045 --> 07:01.379
Looks like we both moved on,

07:01.463 --> 07:03.923
so no reason for things
to be awkward, right?

07:04.007 --> 07:06.343
Congrats.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.135
Yeah, it all happened
so fast,

07:07.218 --> 07:10.639
but when you know,
you know.

07:10.722 --> 07:11.722
Right?

07:19.522 --> 07:20.815
Liam Gallagher.

07:25.236 --> 07:28.156
- Sit down.
- ‐

07:33.578 --> 07:36.122
We don't have current proof
of residency on file for you.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.832
‐ So?
‐ So...

07:37.916 --> 07:39.084
how are we supposed to know
you ain't committing fraud

07:39.167 --> 07:40.377
so you can go to this school?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.795
You think someone
would commit fraud

07:41.878 --> 07:43.380
to attend this shithole?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.632
My job is tied to how much
paperwork is completed

07:45.715 --> 07:47.175
and how many files are current,

07:47.258 --> 07:49.135
so if your dad,
Francis Gallagher,

07:49.219 --> 07:51.513
could just bring us a copy
of his valid state‐issued ID.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.349
He doesn't have
a valid state ID.

07:54.432 --> 07:57.519
Okay, then copies of two
utility bills in his name.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.105
All right, then he's gonna have
to come in and sign this form

08:00.188 --> 08:01.690
attesting to his residence.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.110
If we don't get this, I'll
have to remove you from school

08:05.193 --> 08:07.278
while we investigate this
as a fraud case.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.656
A vacation from this school?

08:09.739 --> 08:11.199
What's the downside?

08:11.282 --> 08:12.867
Any student removed from school

08:12.951 --> 08:16.121
triggers
an automatic review by CPS.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.330
See the downside
of a month or two

08:17.414 --> 08:18.454
in a state‐run group home?

08:34.806 --> 08:35.932
‐ You Carl?
‐ Yeah.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.352
Where are your gloves?
Jesus, rookie.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.938
Think you can sling trash
without protection?

08:42.020 --> 08:43.565
You'll tear your hands
to shreds.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.985
Those are just loaners, though.
I want 'em back.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.070
What are you doing
on a garbage route, kid?

08:49.154 --> 08:51.072
How'd you get this job?

08:51.156 --> 08:52.282
Someone recommended me.

08:52.365 --> 08:53.116
Ah.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.118
Friends in high places, huh?

08:55.201 --> 08:56.911
So where do we start?

08:56.995 --> 08:58.079
With breakfast.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.506
Okay, when you get home,

09:08.590 --> 09:10.175
here's what you're gonna
want to do.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.843
You're gonna want to do
the rice method.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.845
That's where you take
your entire foot

09:13.928 --> 09:17.557
and submerge it
into a bag of rice.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.934
That's not it.
RICE is an acronym.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.731
No, it's not.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.066
What's an acronym?

09:26.149 --> 09:27.859
Rest, ice, compress, elevate.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.235
R‐I‐C‐E.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.321
One of us is a trained
medical professional,

09:31.404 --> 09:33.281
and one of us fucked her
ankle up running through a park

09:33.364 --> 09:34.908
trying to catch a Pokémon
with her phone.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.785
I know who I'd trust
in this situation.

09:36.868 --> 09:41.122
That'll be $20 for the ankle
and $20 for the abortion.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.666
Thank you.
Here, let me help you out.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.752
Thank you. Come again.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.798
‐ Kev.
‐ Yeah?

09:49.881 --> 09:51.466
The girls made it
to the next round

09:51.549 --> 09:54.135
of the Eldridge Academy
application process.

09:54.219 --> 09:56.846
We're preapproved for a full
financial aid package

09:56.930 --> 09:59.641
if we get in, and they invited
us to the charity auction.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.643
That's a good sign,
right?

10:01.726 --> 10:03.812
Isn't it a little early
to talk about kindergarten?

10:03.895 --> 10:05.230
Not at all.

10:05.313 --> 10:07.732
It's super competitive,
and it's only a year away.

10:07.816 --> 10:09.818
Plus, I thought
you wanted us to apply.

10:09.901 --> 10:13.029
I did, but that's because
I thought we'd be rejected...

10:13.113 --> 10:15.240
so the school would
be the asshole and not me.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.909
V, wh‐‐our girls‐‐

10:17.992 --> 10:19.828
what if they don't fit in
at Eldridge?

10:19.911 --> 10:21.329
There's all those rich kids.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.539
It's diverse,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.332
politically progressive,
and safe.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.084
You want the girls going
to Coolidge?

10:26.167 --> 10:26.918
A second‐grader got caught

10:27.001 --> 10:28.753
going through
the metal detector

10:28.837 --> 10:29.796
with a machete last week.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.089
A machete, Kev.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.674
Maybe he had dense foliage
to clear after school.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.468
We're getting the girls
into Eldridge.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.178
Okay. How?

10:37.262 --> 10:39.639
By being active,
reliable, and engaged.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.933
That means going to everything
they invite us to,

10:42.016 --> 10:44.102
like this auction.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.312
What the hell are we gonna buy
at an auction?

10:46.396 --> 10:47.814
We don't have to buy
anything.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.440
We just need to show up.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.693
I'll RSVP.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.073
That's not mine.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.242
Or that.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.620
Or that.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.875
That is definitely not mine.

11:06.958 --> 11:08.710
Oh, come on.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.379
Use your common sense, fellas.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.007
What could I even do
with all those drugs?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.217
I admit I have
a healthy appetite,

11:16.301 --> 11:18.136
but I'm only one man.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.596
My guess is you
were gonna sell 'em.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.805
Ask around.

11:20.889 --> 11:24.225
Everyone'll tell you,
I'm a user, not a dealer.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.352
None of this is mine.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.104
It's a setup.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.106
It's not even my car.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.191
You don't say.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.525
I‐I do say.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.110
Already ran
the plates, bub.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.446
Car was reported stolen
four days ago.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.582
Oh, you really
did a number on me, Faye.

11:55.173 --> 11:56.591
You want to give us
a hand here?

11:56.674 --> 11:57.884
Not really.

11:58.760 --> 11:59.552
Breakfast is served.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.096
You guys eat
out of the garbage?

12:02.180 --> 12:05.391
Hey, these bagels
haven't been touched.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.435
End of the night,
they just throw out

12:07.518 --> 12:09.312
whatever they didn't sell.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.607
Yeah, I don't know about that.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.067
Eat.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.820
We're the top garbage crew
in the city, Carl.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.031
There's guys who worked
sanitation ten years,

12:20.114 --> 12:21.783
die to get onto this route,

12:21.866 --> 12:23.660
and you just show up
out of nowhere,

12:23.743 --> 12:25.620
actin' like your shit
don't stink,

12:25.703 --> 12:27.622
like you're too good
to eat a Dumpster bagel.

12:27.705 --> 12:30.416
Strikes me
as a little suspicious.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.668
Eat.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.091
Except cinnamon raisin.
Those go to the boss man.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.553
Jackpot.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.097
Low‐fat garden veggie.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.275
Hey, man, so this, uh,
Tamietti family meeting thing?

12:55.358 --> 12:57.944
‐ Yeah, we got that text, too.
‐ Right.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.571
We don't actually have to‐‐
to go, do we?

13:00.655 --> 13:02.490
We absolutely have to go.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.450
You got a kid
with a Tamietti.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.536
Comes with
certain expectations.

13:06.619 --> 13:09.497
I got a second one on the way,
so I'm, like, doubly obligated.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.832
And the pain of sitting

13:10.915 --> 13:12.583
through a family meeting
is nothing compared

13:12.667 --> 13:14.544
to the passive‐aggressive
ball‐busting you're gonna get

13:14.627 --> 13:15.837
if you don't go.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.673
I missed a family meeting once,
like, three years ago.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.842
They still call me
"No Show Brad."

13:20.925 --> 13:22.969
So, uh...

13:23.052 --> 13:25.722
you know, what am I supposed
to do during this meeting?

13:25.805 --> 13:28.182
You know, do they expect me
to weigh in on shit?

13:28.266 --> 13:29.851
No, not really.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.103
No one expects you
to offer up your own opinions.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.521
So, what, I just sit there?

13:33.604 --> 13:35.440
No, just support your lady.

13:35.523 --> 13:37.275
Nod a lot when Tami's talking

13:37.358 --> 13:39.068
and then repeat
exactly what she says.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.611
Works like a charm.

13:40.695 --> 13:41.863
So be a yes‐man.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.073
‐ Absolutely. Yes away.
‐ All right.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.284
It's the only way to survive
a Tamietti relationship.

14:01.632 --> 14:02.632
Debbie!

14:04.635 --> 14:05.553
Hey.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.139
I have a quick question.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.766
Do you want a job?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.601
Here, with me?

14:11.684 --> 14:14.270
Personal home assistant.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.147
You know, cooking,
running errands,

14:16.230 --> 14:18.232
maybe alphabetizing
hair products.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.902
Anything that will keep you
in my house all day.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.780
You don't think that'd
be kind of weird,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.406
me working for you?

14:25.490 --> 14:26.783
It doesn't have to be.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.159
I'll pay you $30 an hour.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.244
And you can drive
one of my cars.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.914
The Audi or the, uh,
Range Rover.

14:32.997 --> 14:33.998
You pick.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.043
If you can't tell by now,

14:37.126 --> 14:39.003
I'm, uh...

14:39.087 --> 14:40.797
crazy about you.

14:42.757 --> 14:44.634
How about I think about it?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.427
Yeah. No pressure.

14:46.511 --> 14:49.097
But say yes.

14:49.180 --> 14:50.890
‐ Bye.
‐ Bye.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.073
Shouldn't you be in school?

15:07.156 --> 15:09.909
Got more important stuff to do.
Got to find Frank.

15:09.992 --> 15:10.952
Why?

15:11.035 --> 15:13.121
We couldn't find him
for most of 2005.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.539
Then one day,
there he was,

15:14.622 --> 15:16.457
passed out
on the kitchen floor.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.292
He's like a cat.
He'll be back.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.627
If I don't find him soon,

15:19.710 --> 15:22.296
they're gonna
kick me out of school.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.048
What are you doing?

15:24.132 --> 15:25.883
Trying to find the right
Grindr profile picture.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.803
None of the ones I put up
got any hits.

15:28.886 --> 15:29.804
Grindr?

15:29.887 --> 15:33.099
Aren't you still in love
with Mickey?

15:33.182 --> 15:34.559
Yeah, I am.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.519
But there was the whole
half‐proposal thing

15:36.602 --> 15:39.063
and the whole "him getting
a new boyfriend" thing

15:39.147 --> 15:40.356
and the promise‐ring thing,

15:40.439 --> 15:42.483
and I'm desperate.

15:42.567 --> 15:43.818
Now I stupidly told him that
I have a date for tomorrow,

15:43.901 --> 15:46.320
and I actually
have to find one.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.697
Sorry I asked.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.949
Let me see those pictures.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.706
These are putting me to sleep.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.499
No one wants to date
their youth pastor

15:58.583 --> 16:00.585
from their grandma's church.

16:00.668 --> 16:02.545
‐ Jesus.
‐ You considered spicing it up?

16:02.628 --> 16:04.797
Why not take your shirt off
or something?

16:04.881 --> 16:06.674
I'm looking for a date,
not a hookup.

16:06.757 --> 16:07.800
The way you're headed,

16:07.884 --> 16:10.052
you're not gonna get
either one.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.846
Give me that.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.514
Maybe Frank's dead.

16:13.598 --> 16:16.058
Better go call the morgue.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.358
I didn't see it coming.

16:24.442 --> 16:29.113
I was a fly caught in the web
the entire time,

16:29.197 --> 16:30.031
and I didn't realize
I was trapped

16:30.114 --> 16:33.826
until the spider
was already eating me.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.704
You know you have the right
to remain silent, right?

16:36.787 --> 16:39.290
Yeah, uh, I'm waiving
all of that.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.500
Only a woman
could've done this.

16:41.584 --> 16:45.213
Only a woman can lure you in,

16:45.296 --> 16:49.425
make you feel
like the king of the castle,

16:49.508 --> 16:52.428
and stab you in the back
all at the same time.

16:53.971 --> 16:57.058
Show me your hands, please.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.851
No. Uh, ears.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.187
You got to do my ears first,
then my nose, then my mouth.

17:01.270 --> 17:04.357
Shit. Sorry.
I'm‐‐I'm kind of new at this.

17:04.440 --> 17:05.566
Oh, that's all right, lad.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.068
I'll walk you through it.

17:07.151 --> 17:10.695
You‐‐you want to hear the‐‐
the real head trip, though?

17:10.780 --> 17:13.741
I still kind of like her.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.910
Her quest for revenge,

17:15.992 --> 17:19.121
albeit bordering
on psychopathy,

17:19.204 --> 17:20.539
is justified.

17:20.623 --> 17:25.252
How can you be angry
at justifiable revenge?

17:25.336 --> 17:26.753
You can't.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.423
And her thoroughness

17:29.507 --> 17:32.260
and her ruthless efficiency...

17:32.343 --> 17:33.636
Ah.

17:33.719 --> 17:37.306
...her attention to detail,

17:37.390 --> 17:39.767
it's impressive,
don't you think?

17:41.435 --> 17:43.229
What next?

17:43.312 --> 17:44.188
The scrotum.

17:44.272 --> 17:47.817
With the right testicular
configuration,

17:47.900 --> 17:50.736
you can hide all kinds
of things under there.

17:50.820 --> 17:55.658
The gooch is mankind's
marsupial pouch.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.201
You remember that.

18:00.204 --> 18:03.708
You know, if‐‐if we'd met
under different circumstances

18:03.791 --> 18:06.669
and I never got her soul mate
locked up for life,

18:06.752 --> 18:08.296
things could've worked out
for us.

18:08.379 --> 18:11.090
I think this is the part
where you spread your cheeks

18:11.173 --> 18:12.341
and... cough?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.051
Exactly right. You see?

18:14.135 --> 18:16.804
You remember more than
you give yourself credit for.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.193
Oh, she's good.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.488
Pay attention.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.657
That's overflowing.

18:36.741 --> 18:39.368
Yo!
Car battery, paint thinner.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.496
Prohibited items
and an overflowing can.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.623
Leave it.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.499
Wait. All of it?

18:45.583 --> 18:46.417
I mean, it's just a few things.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.335
We could pick through it.

18:47.418 --> 18:48.753
Not our job to sort, man.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.504
If we did it for 'em,
how are these fucking people

18:50.588 --> 18:51.797
ever gonna learn?

18:51.881 --> 18:54.175
The only way to teach 'em‐‐
tough love.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.384
Leave it.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.178
Got to bend
with your knees, man.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.473
You only get 7,000 waist‐bends
in a lifetime.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.433
Then what happens?

19:02.516 --> 19:03.517
You die.

19:03.601 --> 19:05.978
Hey.

19:06.062 --> 19:08.314
My mom accidentally threw out
a bunch of sneakers‐‐

19:08.397 --> 19:10.066
expensive ones
I was gonna sell online.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.651
Sorry to hear that, kid.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.277
Can you help me get them out?

19:13.361 --> 19:14.528
Oh, no.

19:14.612 --> 19:15.696
Wh‐‐why not?

19:15.780 --> 19:17.448
I'm just that house
right down there.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.866
They're probably still
near the top.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.159
Safety issue.

19:20.242 --> 19:21.535
Come on, bro.
You're killing me.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.204
I'm gonna be out, like,
1,500 bucks.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.997
Call the sanitation department,

19:25.081 --> 19:28.834
tell 'em you lost something
on truck 3871.

19:28.918 --> 19:32.546
They'll send someone
to look for you.

19:32.630 --> 19:34.674
Yo.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.676
This isn't truck 3871.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.427
How slow are you, Carl?

19:38.511 --> 19:40.763
Like, short‐bus slow, or...

19:40.846 --> 19:43.265
I guess regular.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.850
Let's go fishing.

19:48.187 --> 19:51.565
Chuck, step up.
Step right up.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.360
Here you go, my friend.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.904
‐ Enjoy.
‐ Oh...

19:56.987 --> 19:58.948
More where that came from.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.081
Don't think Frank's dead.

20:07.164 --> 20:08.624
The morgue doesn't have
any record of him.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.875
Well, don't be so sure.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.460
Bodies can spend weeks
in Lake Michigan

20:11.544 --> 20:13.504
before they finally
wash up on shore.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.757
‐ Maybe he's a floater.
‐

20:16.841 --> 20:18.134
What's going on?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.511
That shirtless picture's
getting me tons of attention.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.762
- You were right.
- ‐

20:21.846 --> 20:23.097
Of course I was.

20:23.180 --> 20:26.058
So was I.
None of these are for dates.

20:26.142 --> 20:26.684
Dick pic.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.853
Butthole pic.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.563
Offer to eat my ass.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.564
Dick pic.

20:31.647 --> 20:32.898
Orgy invite.

20:32.982 --> 20:33.983
Dick pic.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.403
Wait.
No idea what that one is.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.696
Oh, wait.
No, it's a dick.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.783
Hold on.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.076
This guy...

20:44.160 --> 20:44.994
Cole,

20:45.077 --> 20:46.787
says he's always
looking for an excuse

20:46.871 --> 20:50.040
to put on his best outfit,
and he loves live music.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.293
He's cute.
He seems normal.

20:52.376 --> 20:53.544
Cool.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.130
Hi.

20:56.213 --> 20:59.133
Kevin Ball
and Veronica Fisher.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.635
Uh, yep. You're all set.

21:01.719 --> 21:02.678
You're lot 14.

21:02.762 --> 21:03.637
Excuse me?

21:03.721 --> 21:05.222
Lot 14.
The auction.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.599
Lot 14?

21:06.682 --> 21:08.976
That's when you'll get up
onstage to be auctioned.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.561
‐ We're being auctioned?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

21:10.644 --> 21:14.356
V, V, we need to get
out of here right now.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.858
I've seen this in movies.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.485
Before you know it,
we're gonna be in the woods,

21:17.568 --> 21:18.778
and we're gonna be chased down
by rich dudes

21:18.861 --> 21:19.820
that hunt humans for sport.

21:19.904 --> 21:20.863
Look, sweetie,

21:20.946 --> 21:21.989
I shouldn't have to explain
to you

21:22.072 --> 21:24.492
the problem of telling a woman
who looks like me

21:24.575 --> 21:26.327
that she's up for auction.

21:26.410 --> 21:27.661
Oh...

21:28.913 --> 21:31.123
This is a date‐night
fund‐raising auction.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.708
Applicant parents are auct‐‐

21:32.792 --> 21:33.584
Did you say "African"?

21:33.667 --> 21:34.877
Uh, no.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.798
No, um, applicant parents
are auctioned off.

21:38.881 --> 21:40.841
Once the parents that buy you
get to know you,

21:40.925 --> 21:43.260
they report back, let us know
if you're a good fit

21:43.344 --> 21:45.137
for the Eldridge community.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.681
The email explained everything.

21:47.765 --> 21:51.435
When you RSVP'd,
you agreed to participate.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.020
‐ Right. Got it.
‐

21:53.103 --> 21:54.772
Sorry for the confusion.

21:58.359 --> 21:59.985
Hi.

22:00.069 --> 22:03.072
We need to get out of here
while we still have a chance.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.577
No Show Brad showed.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.703
Guys, it's a Christmas miracle.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.664
Thank you. Thank you.

22:11.747 --> 22:12.915
‐ Thank you.
‐ All right, all right.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.250
Everybody quiet down.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.210
Let's get this meeting started.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.629
First, the bad news.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.297
Oopie and I discovered Nana

22:20.381 --> 22:23.217
wandering the streets
of Milwaukee.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.053
She was barefoot,
disoriented,

22:26.136 --> 22:27.763
and by the time we caught up
with her,

22:27.847 --> 22:29.223
she kept calling me Bing,

22:29.306 --> 22:32.560
and she just wanted to sing
Christmas carols with Oopie.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.478
We made the tough choice

22:34.562 --> 22:36.564
of putting her
in a nursing home.

22:36.647 --> 22:39.066
I told you we should've put her
in a home years ago.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.694
I mean, thank God
we found her when we did.

22:41.777 --> 22:43.195
We really should've put her
in that home five years ago.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.447
Now for the good news.

22:45.531 --> 22:48.075
Nana's house is empty,
no mortgage.

22:48.158 --> 22:50.077
We could rent it out.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.329
One of my clients did that
when her grandpa passed,

22:52.413 --> 22:54.415
and it's, like, free money
every month.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.875
Yeah, no.

22:55.958 --> 22:56.959
We‐‐we could always‐‐
we could rent it out, you know?

22:57.042 --> 23:00.838
Um, Tami's client
and the client's grandfather‐‐

23:00.921 --> 23:02.548
that's, you know‐‐
you can make a lot of money.

23:02.631 --> 23:03.757
That way‐‐free money.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.801
That's a possibility.

23:05.885 --> 23:09.722
Or we could walk
a more Christian path.

23:09.805 --> 23:13.893
Maybe we should use this turn
of events to demonstrate

23:13.976 --> 23:17.313
Jesus's love for us
by helping family members

23:17.396 --> 23:20.608
who are living
with difficult circumstances,

23:20.691 --> 23:25.070
like a new mom working herself
to the bone to make ends meet

23:25.154 --> 23:28.073
or a new dad
who has to cram his family

23:28.157 --> 23:31.744
into a tiny, decrepit RV
in the backyard.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.537
That's one idea,

23:33.621 --> 23:36.332
an idea I am in favor of.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.209
So, if anyone has a problem
with our suggestion,

23:39.293 --> 23:40.878
now's the time to speak up.

23:40.961 --> 23:45.132
If anyone has an issue
with us doing what's right,

23:45.215 --> 23:48.594
walking the path our Lord
and Savior has laid out for us,

23:48.677 --> 23:51.305
helping those
less fortunate than us,

23:51.388 --> 23:53.891
speak now.

23:53.974 --> 23:56.143
W‐‐

23:56.226 --> 23:57.102
So you're saying that‐‐

23:57.186 --> 23:59.772
We're giving you
Nana's house, sweetheart,

23:59.855 --> 24:01.732
while you get back
on your feet.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.656
So you're doing the mom
and the daughter?

24:08.739 --> 24:09.823
'Cause that's hot.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.200
No, it's not.

24:11.283 --> 24:14.286
‐ It's going south fast.
‐ You're going south fast.

24:14.370 --> 24:17.498
No, I'm serious.
It's stressing me out.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.458
I almost got busted
this morning.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.835
I'm starting to feel really
guilty about this whole thing.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.295
No way, girl!

24:23.379 --> 24:25.714
I hooked up with a father
and son once‐‐it was awesome.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.258
One of them is the baby daddy
of my third daughter,

24:28.342 --> 24:30.844
and I have no clue which one.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.721
Why don't you just take
a paternity test?

24:32.805 --> 24:33.806
I just never had to,
'cause, like,

24:33.889 --> 24:37.142
the dad was so afraid
of the wife finding out

24:37.226 --> 24:38.978
that he just gave me
more child support

24:39.061 --> 24:40.938
than the son ever could, so...

24:41.021 --> 24:43.565
So is that child support
or hush money?

24:44.274 --> 24:46.902
I mean, what's the difference?

24:46.986 --> 24:48.362
Claudia, the mom,

24:48.445 --> 24:50.614
she wants to pay me
30 bucks an hour

24:50.698 --> 24:52.533
to basically just
sit around the house all day

24:52.616 --> 24:54.159
and cook a little, clean,

24:54.243 --> 24:55.869
run some errands.

24:55.953 --> 24:58.831
Girl, I have done way worse
for $30, okay?

24:58.914 --> 25:01.625
I have done... some foot stuff.

25:01.709 --> 25:03.877
Like, a lot of foot stuff.

25:05.254 --> 25:09.425
Yeah, so it's not really
just about the money for me.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.427
The daughter,
I don't know.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.555
She's really fun
and creative and smart

25:14.638 --> 25:16.849
and surprisingly super bendy.

25:16.932 --> 25:17.641
I'm so confused.

25:17.725 --> 25:20.394
How is this even
a conversation?

25:20.477 --> 25:23.647
You dump the kid,
and you stick with the money.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.902
And after that,
we'll go back to our house,

25:28.986 --> 25:29.737
grill up some steaks,

25:29.820 --> 25:31.488
watch an action movie
of your choice

25:31.572 --> 25:35.617
on our state‐of‐the‐art
basement home theater.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.411
Steaks and action movies.

25:37.494 --> 25:38.746
Who doesn't love that?

25:38.829 --> 25:40.456
All right, let's start
the bidding at $300.

25:40.539 --> 25:41.999
- Do we have $300?
- $300.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.333
$300, all right.
$400, $400?

25:43.417 --> 25:44.418
What about $500?

25:44.501 --> 25:46.336
‐ $500.
‐ $500. $500‐‐we've got $500.

25:46.420 --> 25:48.172
$550.
$550 going once.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.215
$550 going twice.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.842
- Sold, $550.
- ‐

25:51.925 --> 25:56.096
All right, Please welcome
the next couple up for auction,

25:56.180 --> 25:57.931
lot number 14,

25:58.015 --> 25:59.433
prospective parents
from the South Side,

25:59.516 --> 26:03.812
Veronica Fisher
and Kevin Ball.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.606
- Hi.
- ‐

26:05.689 --> 26:09.401
Hi, I'm Veronica.
This is Kevin.

26:09.485 --> 26:13.614
We're the Balls, and, uh,
we are small‐business owners,

26:13.697 --> 26:15.866
and we can offer you guys

26:15.949 --> 26:20.496
a night of free drinking
in our humble little bar.

26:22.539 --> 26:25.626
We also have a newly
established medical practice,

26:25.709 --> 26:27.461
where we could offer you
and your daughters

26:27.544 --> 26:28.670
unlimited abo‐‐

26:31.715 --> 26:34.009
I also can provide you
with a personalized workout.

26:34.093 --> 26:37.012
Uh, V and I are in pretty
good shape, so...

26:39.973 --> 26:41.517
Take it off!

26:43.143 --> 26:44.561
All right, a day of drinking

26:44.645 --> 26:47.106
followed
by a personal workout‐‐

26:47.189 --> 26:48.816
Okay, Magic Mike.

26:48.899 --> 26:51.068
Let's start
the bidding at $50.

26:51.151 --> 26:54.029
Do we have $50?
All right, $100, $100.

26:54.113 --> 26:57.324
‐ Do we have‐$5,000.

26:59.159 --> 27:02.246
$5,000? Is that what‐‐

27:04.081 --> 27:07.501
$5,000.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.233
Can we please move away
from the truck?

27:31.316 --> 27:32.526
You get used to it.

27:32.609 --> 27:33.652
‐ Really?
‐ This?

27:33.735 --> 27:35.320
This is about
as good as it gets.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.072
It's not even hot out.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.241
You should smell this shit
in July. Whoo!

27:39.324 --> 27:40.409
Remember that time
we ate Indian food

27:40.492 --> 27:41.410
with the corpse in the truck?

27:41.493 --> 27:43.120
60% decomposed.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.997
When the compactor
hit it‐‐splat!

27:45.080 --> 27:47.291
‐ Like tomatoes.
‐ Still finished our marsala.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.712
We're finishing up.

27:51.795 --> 27:54.381
Give us a second.
We'll move.

27:56.216 --> 27:58.510
All right, all right.
Hold your horses.

27:59.845 --> 28:01.722
Move it up,
move it up.

28:03.724 --> 28:05.893
Got a man in a hurry.

28:13.317 --> 28:16.236
Come on back.
Cut it hard.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.089
- That's awesome.
- Oh!

28:38.550 --> 28:40.427
Fuck that guy. Whoo.

28:45.349 --> 28:47.434
You got five minutes.

28:50.354 --> 28:51.813
I told them we were married.

28:51.897 --> 28:54.024
Slipped 'em 50
to bring you to me.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.943
Well, you wasted your money,

28:56.026 --> 28:57.778
'cause I'm not talking to you.

28:57.861 --> 29:00.447
This is how
it had to be, Frank.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.283
I need you to understand

29:03.367 --> 29:06.703
exactly what's
gonna happen and why.

29:06.787 --> 29:08.872
They found enough
prescription pills on you

29:08.956 --> 29:11.500
to put you away for 30 years.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.543
I expect you'll spend
the rest of your life

29:13.627 --> 29:15.963
in a maximum‐security prison,

29:16.046 --> 29:18.674
just like my dear,
sweet Kyle.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.092
Any way around it?

29:20.175 --> 29:21.635
Justice is justice,

29:21.718 --> 29:24.972
and you got what you deserve.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.101
Will you come visit me
in the big house?

29:33.397 --> 29:36.817
Take care of yourself, Frank.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.735
I left you a little something.

29:57.254 --> 29:59.131
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.764
My dad wanted me
to give you these.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.936
Oh, uh,
to your grandma's house.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.271
He made copies

30:14.354 --> 30:16.440
as soon as the hardware store
opened today.

30:16.523 --> 30:17.774
Cool.

30:23.572 --> 30:26.992
So... you want to go see it?

30:28.785 --> 30:30.871
What, the house?

30:30.954 --> 30:32.998
I mean, it's as good
a time as any.

30:35.042 --> 30:36.084
Yeah, no.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.420
I mean, I just started
working on this, so...

30:40.881 --> 30:43.425
Work the only thing
keeping you from going?

30:43.508 --> 30:44.551
Well, yeah, work and, uh...

30:44.634 --> 30:47.846
the fact that
it's in Wisconsin.

30:47.929 --> 30:50.307
You know,
"I live in Wisconsin."

30:50.390 --> 30:53.060
Yeah, that‐‐that doesn't even
sound right, so...

30:54.394 --> 30:57.522
I'm not excited
about Milwaukee either.

30:57.606 --> 31:00.317
But it's a free house.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.778
I mean, I think we got to
at least check it out, right?

31:02.861 --> 31:04.738
I haven't even seen it
in years.

31:04.821 --> 31:06.740
Right.

31:06.823 --> 31:07.824
Right.

31:10.452 --> 31:11.745
What's up, bro?
You good?

31:11.828 --> 31:13.121
Never took you
for a day drinker.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.122
Yeah, I'm good.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.333
Just waiting for my date
to get here.

31:16.416 --> 31:18.001
Oh, Mickey?

31:18.085 --> 31:20.754
No, a new guy.
Mickey and I broke up.

31:20.837 --> 31:22.380
Oh, no shit.

31:22.464 --> 31:24.841
Tired of all that
Milkovich bullshit, huh?

31:26.676 --> 31:28.804
Hey, what do you know
about rich people?

31:28.887 --> 31:31.598
I want to thank you
for showing such interest

31:31.681 --> 31:33.100
in our little family
and for pledging so much

31:33.183 --> 31:36.436
to spend the day with us‐‐
it was very generous.

31:36.520 --> 31:37.854
You ever heard
of hunting groups

31:37.938 --> 31:39.940
that track and kill people
for sport?

31:40.023 --> 31:41.691
‐ Uh‐Secret societies

31:41.775 --> 31:43.527
that reach the highest
forms of government?

31:43.610 --> 31:45.445
Sex cults?
Devil worshipping?

31:45.529 --> 31:46.655
Private islands

31:46.738 --> 31:47.322
that have fighting tournaments
to the death?

31:47.405 --> 31:49.616
Human traffic‐‐

31:49.699 --> 31:52.244
Can't say I've heard
of any of that, man.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.496
‐ Holler if you need me.
‐ Sure.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.707
So a little bit
about our girls.

31:57.791 --> 31:59.376
They are natural learners.

31:59.459 --> 32:01.628
They know all of their letters
and numbers,

32:01.711 --> 32:03.839
and I bet they'll be reading
any day now.

32:03.922 --> 32:07.592
Your patrons are fascinating.

32:07.676 --> 32:09.177
- Really?
- Mm‐hmm.

32:09.261 --> 32:11.972
They're just regular
workin' folk.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.849
‐ So back to the girls‐Excuse me.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.767
But how can they be working

32:15.851 --> 32:19.646
if they are here in the day
at your bar, drinking?

32:21.022 --> 32:23.775
Night shift?
I don't know.

32:23.859 --> 32:24.901
You're here in the middle
of the day, right?

32:24.985 --> 32:30.031
Yes, of course,
but we are incredibly wealthy.

32:30.115 --> 32:32.242
What are we drinking?

32:32.325 --> 32:34.327
French 75.

32:34.411 --> 32:35.829
Never heard of it.

32:37.539 --> 32:39.708
‐ Caipirinha.
‐ Cappa‐what?

32:39.791 --> 32:42.210
Sazerac? Negroni?
Um...

32:43.962 --> 32:46.715
Okay.
A I. Paloma, hmm?

32:47.841 --> 32:51.303
No‐zerac, No‐groni,
and I. Pa‐nopa.

32:51.386 --> 32:52.137
The only fancy thing
we got back there

32:52.220 --> 32:54.097
is a bottle
of "Cream de Mint,"

32:54.181 --> 32:55.640
but that came with the place
when we bought it.

32:55.724 --> 32:56.766
We got beer,

32:56.850 --> 32:58.268
and we got alcohol
from the bottle.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.145
Well, here's an idea.

33:00.228 --> 33:01.479
Let's skip the bar

33:01.563 --> 33:04.816
and reconvene at your house
after the sun sets.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.651
That way, we can discuss
your application

33:06.735 --> 33:09.029
and, uh, get to know each other

33:09.112 --> 33:12.365
in a more...
intimate setting.

33:12.449 --> 33:13.533
Huh?

33:19.873 --> 33:21.124
Right?

33:21.208 --> 33:22.292
Why are we laughing?

33:22.375 --> 33:23.710
I don't know.
Just go with it.

33:34.304 --> 33:36.139
Where Ian Gallagher at?

33:42.854 --> 33:43.647
Hi.

33:43.730 --> 33:47.150
‐ Oh. Hey.
‐

33:47.234 --> 33:50.445
Bitch, why are you
babysitting that drink?

33:50.528 --> 33:51.738
Are we gonna pregame

33:51.821 --> 33:54.491
before we get all musical
and shit or what?

33:54.574 --> 33:57.494
Bartender! Bartender!

33:57.577 --> 34:00.622
I'm gonna need a round
of Henny immediately,

34:00.705 --> 34:01.957
like, immediately.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.210
Let's get turnt
in this motherfucker.

34:08.545 --> 34:11.216
I know you're worried
about our age difference,

34:11.299 --> 34:12.926
you know, about my mom,

34:13.009 --> 34:15.594
but the chemistry
we have between us...

34:15.679 --> 34:18.348
it's crazy, right?

34:18.431 --> 34:19.808
Yeah, it is.

34:19.891 --> 34:20.934
I‐I know it's early,

34:21.016 --> 34:23.603
but I think this
could be the real thing,

34:23.687 --> 34:27.023
and if it is, just fuck
all the other stuff.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.317
You know?
That's just noise.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.320
We can't let noise get in
the way of what this could be.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.197
Uh, Julia, what is with
all these signs?

34:36.783 --> 34:38.909
Oh, my God.

34:38.994 --> 34:41.288
Is this a promposal?

34:45.708 --> 34:47.543
Okay, Mr. Gallagher.

34:47.627 --> 34:49.795
You've heard the charges
against you.

34:49.879 --> 34:52.132
What's your plea?

34:52.215 --> 34:53.632
I plead not guilty.

34:53.717 --> 34:54.967
I was framed.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.470
Humor me, Mr. Gallagher.

34:57.554 --> 34:59.723
Who framed you?

35:05.770 --> 35:06.771
Okay, then.

35:06.855 --> 35:08.648
Let's schedule
the preliminary hearing.

35:08.732 --> 35:09.816
My calendar?

35:09.899 --> 35:11.151
It was the drug companies.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.527
Excuse me?

35:12.611 --> 35:14.154
The companies
that made the pills‐‐

35:14.237 --> 35:15.989
they're the ones
who set me up.

35:16.072 --> 35:18.199
A guy like me,

35:18.283 --> 35:21.328
a father of five‐‐
uh, six‐‐

35:21.411 --> 35:24.164
struggling with addiction
all his life?

35:24.247 --> 35:25.874
I never stood a chance.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.709
It's entrapment,
Your Honor,

35:27.792 --> 35:29.502
pharmaceutical entrapment.

35:29.586 --> 35:30.670
It's the corporations‐‐

35:30.754 --> 35:31.921
Let me get this straight.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.090
You think that a company
that doesn't know you from Adam

35:34.174 --> 35:36.009
should be the one
standing here today

35:36.092 --> 35:39.471
instead of you,
a criminal,

35:39.554 --> 35:42.932
whose record dates back
to the Nixon administration?

35:44.809 --> 35:47.687
That's not the way I would've
phrased it, but, yes.

35:47.771 --> 35:49.147
More or less, yes.

35:49.230 --> 35:50.273
Okay.

35:50.357 --> 35:51.900
Well, let me elucidate you

35:51.983 --> 35:55.111
on the perspective of this
court, Mr. Gallagher.

35:57.197 --> 35:58.657
I agree with you.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.536
I grew up on the South Side
of Chicago.

36:03.620 --> 36:04.829
I have friends and family

36:04.913 --> 36:07.082
whose whole lives
were turned upside down

36:07.165 --> 36:10.043
just 'cause they had a couple
of crack rocks in their pocket.

36:10.126 --> 36:12.379
My own brother did ten years

36:12.462 --> 36:14.881
on some trumped‐up
possession charge.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.217
That is a crying shame.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.011
Your Honor, I don't mean
to speak out of turn,

36:20.095 --> 36:23.765
but what exactly
did the War on Drugs get us,

36:23.848 --> 36:26.393
other than generations
of locked‐up parents

36:26.476 --> 36:28.395
away from families
who needed them?

36:28.478 --> 36:29.437
Mm‐hmm.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.731
Why repeat the same cycle?

36:33.817 --> 36:36.611
Why tear Mr. Gallagher away
from his kids?

36:36.695 --> 36:40.115
Why punish a fellow citizen
who has a problem?

36:40.198 --> 36:42.242
An illness, Your Honor.

36:42.325 --> 36:44.411
An illness foisted on me
by greedy drug companies.

36:44.494 --> 36:49.332
I've never heard of an illness
best cured by prison.

36:49.416 --> 36:52.043
Me neither.
Have you, Mr. McClatchy?

36:55.213 --> 36:58.007
No, ma'am.

36:58.091 --> 37:00.343
The district attorney
and the citizens of Chicago

37:00.427 --> 37:02.512
agree with you, Your Honor.

37:02.595 --> 37:06.307
I think we all desire
a new approach.

37:06.391 --> 37:07.934
Uh, Your Honor,

37:08.017 --> 37:10.645
all due deference
and with respect,

37:10.729 --> 37:13.440
but maybe it's time for you
to be the change

37:13.523 --> 37:16.067
you want to see in the world.

37:16.151 --> 37:18.695
Don't push it, Mr. Gallagher.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.991
Without any objections
from the prosecution,

37:23.074 --> 37:27.120
I believe that a pre‐trial
intervention is appropriate.

37:27.203 --> 37:29.748
Mr. Gallagher...

37:31.249 --> 37:32.667
...the Court hereby orders you

37:32.751 --> 37:35.628
to complete 100 hours
of community service

37:35.712 --> 37:36.796
and a court‐approved

37:36.880 --> 37:39.674
residential addiction
therapy program.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.468
All rise.

37:41.551 --> 37:44.053
Thank you, Your Honor.
Thank you.

37:44.137 --> 37:46.055
Hey.

37:56.983 --> 37:59.152
About Lorne and Delphine
coming over tonight,

37:59.235 --> 38:00.320
I'm starting to think
they might be‐‐

38:00.403 --> 38:01.446
They're swingers?

38:01.529 --> 38:03.406
Why else would they pay
$5,000 to date us

38:03.490 --> 38:05.033
if they didn't expect sex?

38:05.116 --> 38:06.826
And at this point,
the only way our daughters

38:06.910 --> 38:09.662
are gonna get into Eldridge
is by engaging in a night

38:09.746 --> 38:11.915
of extremely perverted
wife‐swapping.

38:13.249 --> 38:14.000
So I guess
we should cancel.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.878
It's a shame.

38:16.961 --> 38:17.879
Without Eldridge, our girls

38:17.962 --> 38:19.798
are gonna be putting
their life on the line

38:19.881 --> 38:22.050
every day in public school.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.011
I mean, unless...

38:25.094 --> 38:27.180
Unless what?

38:28.264 --> 38:29.474
Swinging?

38:29.557 --> 38:31.810
It wouldn't be the freakiest
thing we've ever done.

38:31.893 --> 38:33.186
And she's French.

38:33.269 --> 38:36.147
So, in Europe, it's probably
pretty normal, right?

38:36.231 --> 38:37.732
Are you saying
we should do it?

38:37.816 --> 38:39.567
I'm‐‐no, I'm‐‐
I'm saying maybe‐‐

38:40.777 --> 38:43.530
Eldridge is awesome.

38:43.613 --> 38:46.699
I think Scottie Pippen's kids
went to Eldridge.

38:46.783 --> 38:48.827
Rumor has it
Brian Urlacher's did, too.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.995
It doesn't get
cooler than that.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.331
So you would do it?
Swing with them?

38:55.291 --> 38:56.793
All right,
this feels like a trap.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.545
It's not.

38:58.628 --> 39:01.965
You know I would do anything
for you and the girls.

39:02.048 --> 39:04.592
So, if you want me to bang
some extremely hot French lady,

39:04.676 --> 39:06.719
I will, I guess.

39:06.803 --> 39:09.514
And I guess...
I could stomach

39:09.597 --> 39:12.559
letting some living Ken doll
clap my cakes‐‐

39:12.642 --> 39:13.560
for the girls, of course.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.603
‐ Clap your what?
‐ I don't know.

39:16.813 --> 39:18.982
I used to spend
a month each summer

39:19.065 --> 39:20.316
visiting Nana in Milwaukee.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.150
‐ Yeah?
‐ Yeah.

39:21.234 --> 39:22.277
When I was nine,

39:22.360 --> 39:24.779
this drive felt
like it took forever.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.865
I mean, I would've told you
that it would take all day,

39:26.948 --> 39:28.032
but look.

39:28.116 --> 39:31.077
GPS says two hours.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.162
It takes longer to get
across town in traffic.

39:33.246 --> 39:36.666
‐ That's not so bad, right?
‐ No. No, it's not bad.

39:50.763 --> 39:51.598
Yo, how long are we
standing around

39:51.681 --> 39:53.516
until you tell me
what we're doing?

39:53.600 --> 39:56.144
‐ We're waiting.
‐ For what?

39:56.227 --> 39:57.604
For that.

40:08.197 --> 40:09.490
Hey, boss.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.451
Fellas.

40:11.534 --> 40:14.412
So what do you guys say
we check out this open house?

40:14.495 --> 40:16.706
Hmm?

40:16.789 --> 40:19.000
You stay.
Watch the truck.

40:37.936 --> 40:42.231
What the fuck?

40:45.360 --> 40:46.819
‐ Hey.
‐ No, don't touch me.

40:46.903 --> 40:48.404
Okay.

40:48.488 --> 40:50.865
We let things
get out of hand.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.909
It was fun while it lasted.

40:52.992 --> 40:55.995
But I can't go
to a school dance with you.

40:56.079 --> 40:57.372
That's just not possible,
Julia.

40:57.455 --> 40:59.499
It would be possible...

40:59.582 --> 41:03.127
if you liked me
as much as I like you.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.837
I'm sleeping
with your mom, Julia.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.339
So dump her!

41:06.422 --> 41:09.175
I can't afford that right now‐‐
emotionally.

41:09.258 --> 41:11.844
Do you love her?

41:11.928 --> 41:14.180
I'm growing
to care for her.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.057
But she's so old!

41:16.140 --> 41:19.185
She watches "60 Minutes."

41:19.268 --> 41:21.354
She bleaches her mustache.

41:21.437 --> 41:24.857
She lasers the varicose veins
in her legs.

41:24.941 --> 41:27.068
Have you seen her calves?

41:27.151 --> 41:30.363
They're a fucking subway map.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.450
What do you even see in her?

41:37.120 --> 41:38.871
I'm gonna threaten
to kill myself.

41:38.955 --> 41:39.872
You're gonna threaten,

41:39.956 --> 41:40.999
or you're gonna actually
try to kill yourself?

41:41.082 --> 41:44.627
I hate you!

41:50.633 --> 41:52.176
Mr. Gallagher,
welcome to Placid Journeys.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.512
I'm Mora.
I run the place.

41:54.595 --> 41:58.349
Over that way is the spa
and the meditation room.

41:58.433 --> 42:01.227
Down there is the kitchen
with our 24‐hour onsite chef.

42:01.310 --> 42:04.022
Now, she specializes
in farm‐to‐table.

42:04.105 --> 42:05.565
It's parsnip season.

42:05.648 --> 42:06.441
You like parsnips?

42:06.524 --> 42:09.318
As much as the next fella,
I guess.

42:09.402 --> 42:11.279
‐ Mm.
‐ So...

42:11.362 --> 42:13.489
what do you guys
have on tap here?

42:13.573 --> 42:14.323
Methadone?

42:14.407 --> 42:17.160
This is behavioral therapy.

42:17.243 --> 42:18.661
We mainly just talk.

42:18.745 --> 42:20.747
Jesus. Really?

42:20.830 --> 42:23.291
You like smoothies?

42:23.374 --> 42:25.084
Come on.

42:25.168 --> 42:27.211
I got to say,
this is nothing like

42:27.295 --> 42:30.631
the rehab facility
I was sent to back in the day.

42:30.715 --> 42:32.050
And I can't help but notice

42:32.133 --> 42:33.801
that the demographics
have changed.

42:33.885 --> 42:37.638
‐ Everybody here is‐Young, white, rich.

42:37.722 --> 42:39.307
It's the opioid epidemic.

42:39.390 --> 42:40.850
Doctors spent years

42:40.933 --> 42:43.102
under‐prescribing black people
pain medication,

42:43.186 --> 42:45.313
so they never had a chance
to get addicted,

42:45.396 --> 42:47.231
and they don't wind up here.

42:47.315 --> 42:49.025
All that oppression,
and you don't even get

42:49.108 --> 42:51.402
a shot at a good
doctor‐prescribed high?

42:51.486 --> 42:52.403
Meanwhile...

42:52.487 --> 42:55.740
a white cheerleader
sprains an ankle,

42:55.823 --> 42:57.492
and she gets prescribed
a 90‐day supply of Oxy

42:57.575 --> 43:00.244
‐ with six refills.
‐

43:00.328 --> 43:02.038
‐ What are you gonna do?
‐ Hmm.

43:29.065 --> 43:30.316
Well, it's clean.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.950
It smells like my grandma.

43:41.119 --> 43:44.038
I don't see anything
falling down.

43:46.082 --> 43:48.292
Yeah, I was, uh...

43:48.376 --> 43:53.214
kind of expecting a crazy old
cat lady hoarder house.

43:55.049 --> 43:56.801
I mean,
this wallpaper is awful.

43:56.884 --> 43:57.426
We'd take that down.

43:57.510 --> 43:59.971
But I mean, I don't know.

44:00.054 --> 44:01.264
Am I crazy?

44:01.347 --> 44:02.932
This isn't that bad.

44:03.015 --> 44:04.308
I'm gonna check out
the upstairs.

44:04.392 --> 44:05.935
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:27.415 --> 44:30.501
- Pretty big, huh?
- Yeah.

44:30.585 --> 44:33.087
If you wanted to keep
fixing bikes on the side,

44:33.171 --> 44:35.548
you'd have the space.

44:35.631 --> 44:38.301
And I mean, I could fit
a lift stand right here.

44:38.384 --> 44:40.344
Work bench.

44:40.428 --> 44:41.262
Tool cabinet.

44:41.345 --> 44:43.139
I could get maybe...

44:43.222 --> 44:45.975
maybe two bikes in here
at a time, three in a pinch.

44:48.728 --> 44:49.478
It's nice.

44:49.562 --> 44:50.980
Yeah.

44:52.607 --> 44:54.108
‐ Pension?
‐ Yeah.

44:54.192 --> 44:56.110
Pension, holiday,
health benefits,

44:56.194 --> 44:59.197
maternity leave.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.365
Well, I don't really
see maternity leave

45:01.449 --> 45:02.158
being an issue,

45:02.241 --> 45:05.036
so long as you and I
are exclusive.

45:05.119 --> 45:07.413
- But everything else...
- ‐

45:07.496 --> 45:09.540
I'm sure we can
work something out.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.795
I thought we were
watching our carbs.

45:16.047 --> 45:19.175
So is that a yes
to my offer?

45:20.343 --> 45:23.930
Julia, honey, you'd like
to have Debbie around more,

45:24.013 --> 45:25.013
wouldn't you?

45:31.562 --> 45:32.980
All right, well,

45:33.064 --> 45:34.190
don't mind her.

45:34.273 --> 45:35.775
She's just mad
because some boy at school

45:35.858 --> 45:38.945
wouldn't go to the school dance
with her.

45:39.028 --> 45:41.530
Then she comes home,
and she orders pizza,

45:41.614 --> 45:45.159
and it's like, the only thing
more unforgiving than a scale

45:45.243 --> 45:47.620
is a shallow teenage boy.

45:47.703 --> 45:50.122
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

45:50.206 --> 45:52.166
‐ Boys. Heartbreakers.
‐

45:57.213 --> 45:58.213
Hey, Berto.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.926
‐ Trying to find my dad.
‐ Yeah, good luck.

46:03.302 --> 46:04.470
I was hoping you could help.

46:06.847 --> 46:07.765
How?

46:07.848 --> 46:09.308
He was hanging out
with a Latina lady

46:09.392 --> 46:11.519
named Faye
who owns a Rolls Royce.

46:11.602 --> 46:12.853
Maybe you could
look her up for me?

46:12.937 --> 46:14.021
You sure this can't wait?

46:14.105 --> 46:15.564
I literally just
bought this pizza,

46:15.648 --> 46:16.357
and it's only getting colder
by the second.

46:16.440 --> 46:19.485
I'm desperate.

46:19.568 --> 46:21.445
All right,
step into my office.

46:48.180 --> 46:51.017
We ain't got
no free services, you heard?

46:51.100 --> 46:52.685
So give us what you owe,

46:52.768 --> 46:55.187
or we gonna be
at every open house you got.

46:55.271 --> 46:56.397
Jesus.

46:59.233 --> 47:00.234
I was high.

47:01.777 --> 47:02.778
I was on another planet, man.

47:02.862 --> 47:05.948
I never should've been
behind the wheel, but...

47:07.283 --> 47:08.367
...there I was.

47:08.451 --> 47:10.036
One second,
I'm going the wrong way

47:10.119 --> 47:11.439
through a Taco Bell
drive‐through.

47:13.164 --> 47:14.373
Next second,

47:14.457 --> 47:16.000
I'm in a field in Indiana

47:16.083 --> 47:18.294
drinking milk directly
from a cow's udder.

47:19.795 --> 47:21.881
And my dad's all like,

47:21.964 --> 47:24.467
"Well, that's the second
Mercedes you've lost."

47:24.550 --> 47:25.926
And I'm like,
"Well, I'm fine, Dad.

47:26.010 --> 47:28.095
Thanks for asking.

47:28.179 --> 47:30.556
The salmonella's
finally cleared up."

47:32.600 --> 47:35.728
And then he brought me
here again.

47:35.811 --> 47:38.189
I just think he wanted me
out of the picture...

47:39.648 --> 47:42.735
...so I didn't embarrass him
in front of his...

47:42.818 --> 47:45.404
Can't you do something
for this poor kid?

47:45.488 --> 47:46.989
He's obviously dope sick.

47:47.073 --> 47:48.449
No, I can't.

47:48.532 --> 47:50.618
But since you took it upon
yourself to interrupt him,

47:50.701 --> 47:52.495
perhaps you'd like
to share next.

47:52.578 --> 47:53.579
Share what?

47:53.662 --> 47:55.956
Most people use
their initial share

47:56.040 --> 47:57.833
to recount their
addiction journey.

47:59.168 --> 48:00.753
How long is this session?

48:00.836 --> 48:02.421
We have two hours left, Frank.

48:02.505 --> 48:04.131
Just two hours,
and you're wasting your time

48:04.215 --> 48:05.674
on amateur stuff?

48:05.758 --> 48:07.176
Sorry.

48:07.259 --> 48:09.095
Okay.

48:09.178 --> 48:12.598
How many here have mixed
a bottle of fentanyl nose spray

48:12.681 --> 48:14.350
with a half‐gallon
of orange juice

48:14.433 --> 48:15.601
and hidden in the wheel well

48:15.684 --> 48:18.729
of an American Airlines flight
to Rio de Janeiro?

48:18.813 --> 48:19.855
Hands?

48:21.232 --> 48:22.775
No one?

48:22.858 --> 48:25.111

48:25.194 --> 48:27.154

good question, Simon.

50:19.892 --> 50:21.060
This is, uh...

It's not organic.

50:22.102 --> 50:24.563
I thought this
was gonna be about sex.

50:24.647 --> 50:26.524
Me too. I waxed.

50:26.607 --> 50:29.151
But we just need to play nice

You said there'd

50:44.083 --> 50:45.918

51:06.105 --> 51:07.189
Well...

51:07.273 --> 51:11.402
We have not been
around the poor before,

51:11.485 --> 51:14.280
and we wanted Simon
to see how...

51:14.363 --> 51:17.575
you people live.

51:17.658 --> 51:19.577
We were hoping
you would demonstrate to him

51:19.660 --> 51:21.954
destitution and suffering.

51:22.037 --> 51:23.831
To motivate him
to work harder in school.

51:23.914 --> 51:24.957
Mm.

51:25.040 --> 51:27.251
Yes, so he will not end up
in a place like this.

51:39.013 --> 51:40.848
Hi.

51:40.931 --> 51:42.308
Sure, come on in.

51:44.018 --> 51:46.854
‐ How'd you know where I live?
‐ Uh, you took the Audi.

51:46.937 --> 51:49.398
I tracked the GPS.

51:49.481 --> 51:52.359
This place is a dump.

51:52.443 --> 51:54.361
No wonder you're taking
my mom's handouts.

51:54.445 --> 51:55.529
You come here to insult me?

51:55.613 --> 51:57.114
No, I've given it some thought.

51:57.197 --> 51:58.324
Given what some thought?

51:58.407 --> 51:59.617
I've decided

51:59.700 --> 52:02.161
we are going to the homecoming
dance together.

52:02.244 --> 52:04.830
Julia, I thought I made myself
clear the first time.

52:04.913 --> 52:06.457
Oh, no, you did.

52:06.540 --> 52:09.001
But like I said,
I've given it some thought,

52:09.084 --> 52:11.754
and I've decided we're going.

52:11.837 --> 52:13.005
Okay.

52:13.088 --> 52:14.214
No.

52:14.298 --> 52:15.257
There is literally no way

52:15.341 --> 52:18.093
I'm going to the homecoming
dance with you.

52:18.177 --> 52:19.637
And you barging in here
like this,

52:19.720 --> 52:21.347
it's kind of psycho, Julia.

52:21.430 --> 52:22.973
It's a free country,

52:23.057 --> 52:24.892
so you don't have to go.

52:24.975 --> 52:26.393
But if you don't,

52:26.477 --> 52:28.520
I am definitely
gonna tell my mom

52:28.604 --> 52:30.230
that you went down on me.

52:30.314 --> 52:33.525
Three‐‐
no, four times.

52:33.609 --> 52:35.903

52:46.497 --> 52:49.375

once, and he moved in.

53:56.024 --> 53:57.067
and not in a good way.

53:57.151 --> 53:58.986
All right.

53:59.069 --> 54:00.362
You convinced me.

55:17.981 --> 55:20.192
<i>♪ Is always waiting
at the gate ♪</i>

55:20.275 --> 55:21.902
And if you'll let me,

55:21.985 --> 55:23.737
I‐I'd like to spend
the rest of my life‐‐

55:23.820 --> 55:26.532
Jesus Christ, save the fucking
speech, you pussy.

55:26.615 --> 55:28.116
<i>♪ And I was told ♪</i>

55:28.200 --> 55:30.869
I'll marry you.

55:30.953 --> 55:32.412
Of course
I'll fucking marry you.

55:33.997 --> 55:37.501
<i>♪ The drums of war
beat louder warnings ♪</i>

55:38.585 --> 55:39.545
You're late.

55:39.628 --> 55:40.837
You're early.

55:40.921 --> 55:43.465
Just doing my part
to break stereotypes.

55:43.549 --> 55:44.967
What's that smell?

55:45.050 --> 55:46.927
The smell of a man saving
the city from corruption.

55:47.010 --> 55:48.262
Ugh.

55:48.345 --> 55:50.722
Since when does Lip
call family meetings?

55:50.806 --> 55:52.432
Does anyone know
what two lesbians do

55:52.516 --> 55:53.809
when they go to homecoming?

55:53.892 --> 55:56.687
Do they both wear dresses?
Do neither wear dresses?

55:56.770 --> 55:58.438
Come on, man.

55:58.522 --> 55:59.815
‐ Come on.
‐ Come on.

55:59.898 --> 56:01.900
Yeah, that's go‐‐
that's gonna help you a lot.

56:04.194 --> 56:06.488
what the fuck is that smell?

56:06.572 --> 56:09.074
Carl's trying
to save the city.

56:09.157 --> 56:13.161
Hey, everybody.
Uh, thanks for coming.

56:13.245 --> 56:15.872
I wanted to tell you all this
in person.

56:15.956 --> 56:16.623
What, you fall off the wagon?

56:16.707 --> 56:18.584
‐ No.
‐ You going to prison?

56:18.667 --> 56:19.918
What? No.

56:20.002 --> 56:21.169
Tami dumped you.

56:21.253 --> 56:22.504
She's pregnant again?

56:22.588 --> 56:24.256
Oh, she definitely dumped you.

56:24.339 --> 56:26.049
No, will everybody
just shut the fuck up?

56:26.133 --> 56:28.093
Listen, please.

56:32.514 --> 56:34.391
Me, Tami, and Fred
are moving to Milwaukee.

56:36.101 --> 56:40.105
Uh, her family gave us
an old house up there,

56:40.188 --> 56:42.190
and, uh, it's‐‐it's nice.

56:50.532 --> 56:54.119
It's only two hours away,
you know, and it's big,

56:54.202 --> 56:57.039
so you guys can all come up
and visit.

56:57.122 --> 56:59.625
And I'll still be around,
you know, on weekends

56:59.708 --> 57:04.296
and, uh, holidays
and stuff like that, so...

57:11.428 --> 57:12.554
Anyway, that's it.

57:12.638 --> 57:15.474
That's, uh...

57:15.557 --> 57:17.392
That's all I got, so...

57:38.288 --> 57:39.331
Who are you?

57:39.414 --> 57:41.375
I'm your Uncle Frank,

57:41.458 --> 57:43.960
and I'm gonna take care of you.

57:46.129 --> 57:47.714
All I need in return

57:47.798 --> 57:49.091
is for your parents
to make sure

57:49.174 --> 57:52.386
Uncle Frank's commissary
account is nice and full.

57:52.469 --> 57:53.845
I wouldn't smell it.

57:53.929 --> 57:55.639
Just swallow.
