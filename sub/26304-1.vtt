00:01.877 --> 00:05.338
- I had written myself notes.
I only have five minutes.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.673
I didn't want to spend
the entire time rambling.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.467
- It's okay if you ramble.

00:09.468 --> 00:12.303
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

00:12.304 --> 00:14.264
- No, it's not. I don't...

00:15.349 --> 00:19.519
It's right here, so....

00:19.520 --> 00:21.270
Um...

00:21.271 --> 00:24.106
I...

00:24.107 --> 00:26.484
I was online yesterday

00:26.485 --> 00:29.278
and, um, a bunch of people
had posted links

00:29.279 --> 00:31.239
to this infographic, and...

00:31.240 --> 00:32.990
Sorry, does everyone know
what that...

00:32.991 --> 00:35.952
It's a... it's a cartoon
that illustrates statistics.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.453
So, um...

00:37.454 --> 00:39.914
this infographic
was about marriages,

00:39.915 --> 00:42.917
and, um, it said
that if your spouse dies,

00:42.918 --> 00:47.922
it... it feels like losing
$308,780 a year,

00:47.923 --> 00:50.258
which sounded crazy
to me at first.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.426
Like, how do you...

00:52.427 --> 00:54.512
how do you put
a dollar amount on death?

00:54.513 --> 00:56.347
Like, how is that even
a thing with a price tag?

00:56.348 --> 00:57.974
Um...

00:57.975 --> 00:59.809
But then I...

00:59.810 --> 01:01.769
I started to think

01:01.770 --> 01:05.523
about what it would feel like
to lose...

01:05.524 --> 01:09.318
$308,780 a year.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.279
And it would feel like...

01:11.280 --> 01:13.198
like a problem
you could never fix.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.785
It's an impossible amount
of money to lose.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.830
Um...

01:20.831 --> 01:22.665
I don't know
if it's that exact number.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.793
The 780 at the end feels
a bit weird.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.253
Um...

01:27.254 --> 01:29.630
But I...

01:29.631 --> 01:32.633
would say that my...

01:32.634 --> 01:35.804
husband being dead...

01:37.139 --> 01:40.601
Feels like the same kind
of impossible thing.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.522
That's what I got.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.484
- Thanks for sharing.
- Okay, you're welcome.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.820
- You still have a few minutes.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.115
- I don't really want them.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.636
- No.
- Up. Yes, come on.

02:16.637 --> 02:19.347
You teach at 7:00. No. No. No.
No "Moms." Come on.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.933
- Hey, stop.
I'm not wearing pants.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.893
- Your body literally came
out of my vagina.

02:23.894 --> 02:26.771
Do not talk to me about pants.
Come on.

02:26.772 --> 02:29.608
I don't want to be awake.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.194
- I know, sweetie,
but no one wants to be awake.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.862
That's how mornings work.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.031
Here, there's those pants
you were so worried about.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.783
- Yeah.
Get up. Get up.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.243
Get up. Get up. Get up.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.703
Get up. Get up. Get up.
Get up.

02:42.704 --> 02:45.164
Get up. Get up. Get up. Get up.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.919
Babe..

02:49.920 --> 02:52.505
I'm going back to sleep.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.259
You need to take a shower.

02:56.260 --> 02:59.220
You do not smell good enough
to be around my family.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.596
- I smell okay.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.973
- I promise
you don't smell okay.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.100
- I didn't know
I was coming with.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.726
- Do you not want to come?

03:05.727 --> 03:07.603
- I-it's just been a long week.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.438
I thought I'd take
the morning to sleep.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.692
- Matt, please.
I need you.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.903
You always make things better
with my family.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.446
I don't, but you do.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.907
- You know that's not true
about you.

03:19.908 --> 03:23.578
- Please, get up.

03:23.579 --> 03:26.122
Oh, my God.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.959
- Thank you.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.296
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.174
I'll love you more after
you've brushed your teeth.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.926
- Yeah, how about we try
all that again?

03:38.927 --> 03:41.179
- I just love you
and nothing else.

03:41.180 --> 03:42.389
- Yeah, there it is.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.183
- Leigh.
Leigh.

03:46.268 --> 03:47.852
Honey.

03:47.853 --> 03:51.147
You have the 7:00
and 8:15 classes... 9:30.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.607
I'm at noon.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.734
Uh, Jules,
you have the evening slots.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.903
You have group at 8:30.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.488
And I have a date
with a guy who seems nice,

03:59.489 --> 04:01.115
but, you know, kind of
boring on eHarmony.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.575
So let's hope he's nice

04:02.576 --> 04:05.203
and kind of interesting
in real life.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.122
- Hello.

04:09.208 --> 04:12.168
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:12.169 --> 04:13.753
Good morning.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.214
- Hi.
- Can't believe you're here.

04:16.215 --> 04:18.007
Okay, you guys I got to show
you something funny.

04:18.008 --> 04:20.134
Come on. Look at what Mom made.
- What? Oh.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.511
No.
- Yes.

04:21.512 --> 04:22.887
- Wow.
- What?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.057
- What? What's so funny?

04:26.058 --> 04:28.726
Hey, that's not cool.
I don't make fun of your stuff.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.811
- Mom, if you don't want people
to laugh at your vision boards,

04:30.812 --> 04:32.605
don't put so much
healing crystals.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.440
- They are not vision boards.
They are soul collages.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.858
- Oh, right. Of course.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.401
- Well, I think
this is really cool art.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.278
What's the story?
- Thank you.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.614
You collage a card
for each aspect of your soul,

04:41.615 --> 04:43.866
and then you use the cards
to answer your life questions.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.993
So it's sort of like
a personalized tarot deck.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.745
- Oh, my God,
you've got to stop

04:47.746 --> 04:49.288
being a parody of yourself.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.165
- You don't subscribe
to my belief system.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.168
That's just fine, but you give
some respect where it's due.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.337
Everything I have accomplished
in my life

04:56.338 --> 04:59.006
is a result of believing that
I could create my own reality,

04:59.007 --> 05:02.218
and that includes raising
both of you by myself

05:02.219 --> 05:03.803
and running
my own business,

05:03.804 --> 05:06.681
which also apparently
employs you both.

05:06.682 --> 05:09.809
So don't make fun of my magic.
You should be respectful of it.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.103
- I mean, I hear that.
- Thank you. Thank you.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.855
He is my favorite.

05:13.856 --> 05:15.731
- Are you serious?
- You're my favorite.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.025
See? He's nice.
Why are they so horrible to me?

05:18.026 --> 05:20.779
Okay, so that's Thursday.
Let's do this.

05:22.865 --> 05:25.241
Okay?

05:25.242 --> 05:26.868
- Wait, say that all again?
- Come on.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.036
- I'm sorry.

05:28.037 --> 05:30.121
I'm just, like, stupid excited

05:30.122 --> 05:32.039
to get my three-month chip
tonight.

05:34.042 --> 05:36.669
You are a beast.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.254
You're kicking
this thing in the teeth,

05:38.255 --> 05:40.006
and we could not
be more proud of you.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.383
Could we, Leigh?

05:42.384 --> 05:44.595
- Yeah. Everything she said.

05:46.221 --> 05:49.056
- Just, like,
these last few months,

05:49.057 --> 05:51.601
everything has been
so emotional and stressful,

05:51.602 --> 05:55.938
and I could have fallen off
the wagon so many times, but...

05:55.939 --> 05:57.773
I didn't.

05:57.774 --> 05:59.317
I handled it.

05:59.318 --> 06:02.612
- Yep, it really, uh,
screwed me up, too,

06:02.613 --> 06:03.946
when my husband died.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.323
- That's not what I was saying.

06:05.324 --> 06:07.074
- That's exactly
what you were saying...

06:07.075 --> 06:09.160
that my husband being dead
is making it harder

06:09.161 --> 06:10.912
for you to stay sober.

06:10.913 --> 06:12.872
- I wasn't saying it like that.
- You still said it.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.374
- Hey, you. That's enough.
- What?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.502
Take a breath.
- I'm breathing.

06:17.503 --> 06:19.086
- Now do it
with some intention.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.880
Come on
- Whatever.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.716
I'm gonna go to the studio.

06:29.765 --> 06:33.476
How do you expect anyone
to be in a good mood

06:33.477 --> 06:35.604
before the sun's up?

06:37.064 --> 06:39.691
Just think about that.

06:49.660 --> 06:53.579
- Up and press. Heels up like
you're wearing stilettos.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.414
Come on, I know you girls have
higher hells than that.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.208
And up, and press.

06:57.209 --> 06:58.252
Now you're gonna
lower yourself

06:58.253 --> 06:59.836
three inches and hold.

06:59.837 --> 07:01.337
Three inches.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.339
You guys have zero inches.
Three inches.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.049
Come on. Here, you got this.

07:05.050 --> 07:06.884
Come on, match me.
Match me. You got this.

07:06.885 --> 07:08.928
Right now. One inch up.
One inch down.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.680
We're gonna pulse
for ten seconds to tempo.

07:10.681 --> 07:12.181
Yep.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.850
You can do anything
for ten seconds. Mm-hmm.

07:13.851 --> 07:18.145
And pulse.
Two, three, four, five,

07:18.146 --> 07:21.774
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.318
And release.
Good job. Good job.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.153
Now we're gonna go
to butt school, ladies,

07:26.154 --> 07:27.531
and work those seats.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.577
- I'll see you girls later.
- Bye. See you later.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.540
I love you.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.626
Okay.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.171
- Oh, hey, real quick...
I have to ask you something.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.922
- Are you saying you love me
because you have

07:44.923 --> 07:46.632
to ask me something?

07:46.633 --> 07:49.385
- No, I love you, and
I have to ask you something.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.179
- What?

07:51.180 --> 07:53.014
- You've been wearing
a lot of my workout stuff.

07:53.015 --> 07:56.809
But you have your own stuff.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.437
- Yeah,
but it's at my apartment.

07:59.438 --> 08:03.191
- When's the last time
you went to your apartment?

08:03.192 --> 08:05.193
- A little before the funeral.

08:05.194 --> 08:07.236
- It's, like, three months?

08:07.237 --> 08:08.988
All your stuff is still there,

08:08.989 --> 08:11.115
and you're still paying
rent and utilities.

08:11.116 --> 08:12.742
- Yeah.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.994
Yeah, I know.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.747
- So maybe you could go
by your apartment

08:17.748 --> 08:19.208
and get your stuff.

08:21.293 --> 08:24.587
- Sure. Yeah, sure.

08:24.588 --> 08:27.006
- Okay, great.

08:27.007 --> 08:30.301
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.680
I love you.
- I love you, too.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.198
Can you be
my sounding board?

09:33.199 --> 09:35.366
It's for my column.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.326
A high-school girl
just got her heart broken

09:37.327 --> 09:38.995
for the first time,

09:38.996 --> 09:41.998
feels like she is dying.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.542
What does she do?

09:44.543 --> 09:46.460
Keeping doing your homework,

09:46.461 --> 09:48.796
you'll be in love with someone
new by Winter Formal.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.715
You're gonna say that.

09:50.716 --> 09:52.592
No, I'm not gonna say that,

09:52.593 --> 09:54.802
but I just...
I feel like she's 15

09:54.803 --> 09:56.929
and her heart is broken,
and she's going to use it

09:56.930 --> 09:58.723
as an excuse
to be an asshole to her mom.

09:58.724 --> 10:00.308
And I want to tell her
not to do that.

10:00.309 --> 10:03.186
- Yeah, just say all that
in a not-patronizing way.

10:03.187 --> 10:05.313
Ooh.
- I'm going to.

10:05.314 --> 10:06.981
- Yeah?
- Um...

10:06.982 --> 10:09.984
"You've lost
someone important to you,

10:09.985 --> 10:13.237
"but there are people

10:13.238 --> 10:16.616
"who still depend on you.

10:16.617 --> 10:20.453
"So help your friend

10:20.454 --> 10:24.081
"with her mock-trial audition

10:24.082 --> 10:28.461
"and your brother
with his Latin homework

10:28.462 --> 10:31.714
"and tell your mom

10:31.715 --> 10:33.925
"you love her.

10:33.926 --> 10:38.221
"Even though
you know she knows...

10:38.222 --> 10:42.142
she still needs to hear it."

10:43.393 --> 10:45.895
- I really like that.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.939
- Thank you for being
my sounding board.

10:47.940 --> 10:50.566
- Yeah, always.

10:50.567 --> 10:52.360
- You want to get ramen
for dinner?

10:52.361 --> 10:54.111
- Oh, I can't.

10:54.112 --> 10:57.782
I told my brother I would hang
out with him tonight.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.450
- You're always hanging out
with your brother.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.786
- No, I'm always hanging out
with you.

11:01.787 --> 11:03.330
I live with you.

11:07.000 --> 11:10.211
Well, he just got dumped.
It's been hard on him.

11:10.212 --> 11:12.004
You can hang with us
if you want.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.590
- I don't really like hanging
out with regular Danny,

11:14.591 --> 11:17.051
and I definitely don't want
to hang out with dumped Danny.

11:17.052 --> 11:21.138
- Okay, well, I just thought
I'd offer, just in case.

11:21.139 --> 11:24.183
All right, I'm gonna, um...

11:24.184 --> 11:26.811
head out in a few, all right?

11:26.812 --> 11:28.771
Bye, bye, bye.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.912
- Oh, sorry.
- It's okay.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.206
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.127
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:50.128 --> 11:51.711
- You look pretty.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.880
- I slept four hours.
I look like a cadaver.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.007
- Super-hot cadaver.

11:56.008 --> 11:59.385
- It's 'cause I teach
three barre classes a day

11:59.386 --> 12:02.471
and I only get to eat
one fun thing a week.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.473
- What's your fun thing?

12:04.474 --> 12:06.518
- Doughnuts at grief group.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.813
- Jesus.
- I know.

12:12.983 --> 12:14.609
- Well, as long as we're not
having fun...

12:16.278 --> 12:18.529
- There's something
I need to talk to you about.

12:18.530 --> 12:19.781
- What?

12:21.241 --> 12:24.161
- Taylor wants to get
the advice column going again.

12:27.372 --> 12:30.458
- I just don't feel
like the same person

12:30.459 --> 12:31.792
who wrote that anymore.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.169
- I get it,

12:33.170 --> 12:35.254
but I'd love for you
to still write it

12:35.255 --> 12:37.716
as whoever you are now.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.303
- You're a good editor.

12:42.304 --> 12:44.639
And you're
a really good friend.

12:44.640 --> 12:47.725
- And that is a yes?

12:47.726 --> 12:51.187
- That's an
"I'll think about it."

12:51.188 --> 12:53.857
- Okay.
Thinking cadaver.

13:05.452 --> 13:09.080
- Yo, you just, uh, checked
yourself out, didn't you?

13:10.832 --> 13:14.877
Yeah. I did.

13:14.878 --> 13:17.171
Did you get to go
by your apartment?

13:17.172 --> 13:20.341
- You know what?
I didn't end up having time.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.844
- You got to go over there.
I'm out of clothes.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.595
I'm gonna have to teach naked.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.514
- Right. Well, I don't know
what to tell you, Jules.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.516
You're asking me to do
something that I can't do.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.393
- I don't want this
to be a thing.

13:30.394 --> 13:32.520
- I'm just trying to help.
- Yeah, but you're not helping.

13:32.521 --> 13:34.188
I know what helping looks like

13:34.189 --> 13:36.732
'cause that's what I did
for you for, like, a decade.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.485
- Are you gonna list
every mistake I ever made.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.153
Should I get comfortable?

13:41.154 --> 13:43.364
- Sure, 'cause apparently
you don't remember

13:43.365 --> 13:45.950
the hundreds of times
that I had to help you out

13:45.951 --> 13:48.369
'cause you were too wasted
to help yourself.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.746
- But I do remember
that look that you always have

13:50.747 --> 13:53.291
on your face when you get
to feel superior to me.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.459
You never do
anything nice for me

13:55.460 --> 13:58.462
without making me pay
for it later.

13:58.463 --> 14:02.134
- Okay, well, you never do
anything nice for me at all.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.928
I have an idea.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.723
How about you go to
my apartment to get my stuff,

14:08.724 --> 14:11.601
since you're the one
who wants it so badly?

14:11.602 --> 14:14.520
These are my keys.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.815
I got to go to grief group
'cause my husband died.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.943
- How are you getting there?

14:28.327 --> 14:29.953
Smile about it.

14:39.379 --> 14:43.049
"Everyone keeps telling me
that I'll get over him.

14:43.050 --> 14:46.344
"Everyone keeps telling me it's
not the end of the world,

14:46.345 --> 14:48.846
"but if that's true,
then why does it feel

14:48.847 --> 14:51.350
like the end of the world?"

15:05.697 --> 15:08.407
Hi.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.076
Are you here for group?

15:10.077 --> 15:12.245
- Yeah, I was, uh,
just gonna try it out,

15:12.246 --> 15:14.497
see if it was any good
or if it was stupid.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.666
- It's not stupid.
- You been going?

15:16.667 --> 15:18.835
- Mm, yeah, this is my sixth,
seventh week,

15:18.836 --> 15:20.294
something like that.

15:20.295 --> 15:21.754
- I just Googled
"grief group near me,"

15:21.755 --> 15:23.006
and this is what came up.

15:23.007 --> 15:24.382
- Yeah, that's what I did.

15:24.383 --> 15:27.343
I think
that's what everyone does.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.845
- You know what?

15:28.846 --> 15:30.638
Uh, you been going.
This is your thing.

15:30.639 --> 15:32.682
I don't want to show up
and screw with your thing,

15:32.683 --> 15:34.183
so I could...
- I don't own grief group.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.686
- More than me.
- Okay, well, just come,

15:36.687 --> 15:37.938
because I'm gonna feel bad
if you don't.

15:37.939 --> 15:39.397
- No, you won't.

15:39.398 --> 15:41.649
You'd be happy,
'cause you hate me, so...

15:41.650 --> 15:43.234
- I don't hate anyone.

15:43.235 --> 15:45.319
- That's what people say
when they hate you.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.573
- I don't hate you.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.248
Are you coming?

16:02.504 --> 16:04.339
- Hi.

16:07.092 --> 16:09.010
- What is this?

16:09.011 --> 16:11.846
- Oh, we're switching up
snacks.

16:11.847 --> 16:13.931
- Why?
- I got a couple emails.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.683
People are trying
to cut out sugar.

16:15.684 --> 16:19.061
- So there's just, like,
no doughnuts?

16:19.062 --> 16:20.897
- Hey, we have a few minutes
before we start.

16:20.898 --> 16:22.523
Do you want to go outside
and talk?

16:22.524 --> 16:24.650
- Nope, I don't want
to talk to you.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.862
I don't even want to be here
most of the time.

16:27.863 --> 16:30.114
I just... I come here
because usually

16:30.115 --> 16:32.950
it doesn't make me feel better,
but sometimes it does.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.702
But...

16:34.703 --> 16:36.329
you know what?

16:36.330 --> 16:39.666
Nothing makes me
feel better enough!

16:47.716 --> 16:50.302
All I wanted was a doughnut.

16:52.638 --> 16:55.473
That's, um...

16:55.474 --> 16:57.726
what was going
to make me feel better.

17:04.149 --> 17:05.900
Can you stop following me?

17:05.901 --> 17:07.527
Just go back.
Do group. It's good.

17:07.528 --> 17:09.028
- Why don't you go back?

17:09.029 --> 17:10.446
- I just literally
had a psychotic break

17:10.447 --> 17:11.948
over carrot sticks.

17:11.949 --> 17:13.866
- I've seen worse.
- That's not helpful.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.409
- I'm not trying to be helpful.
You want to get a doughnut?

17:15.410 --> 17:16.869
- No, that's okay.

17:16.870 --> 17:18.621
- You were just crying
five seconds ago

17:18.622 --> 17:19.915
because you couldn't have one.

17:19.916 --> 17:21.999
- I wasn't crying.
- Okay, come on.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.252
I know a doughnut shop
near here.

17:24.253 --> 17:26.087
- Yeah, I know the same one.

17:26.088 --> 17:29.090
I drive by it all the time,
and I think about going in,

17:29.091 --> 17:30.175
and I never do.

17:30.176 --> 17:32.468
- Okay.
So come on.

17:32.469 --> 17:34.512
- I will buy you a doughnut,
and if you're not being

17:34.513 --> 17:36.097
too much of a bitch,
I'll buy you two.

17:36.098 --> 17:38.391
- That's an ugly word
with an ugly history.

17:38.392 --> 17:41.269
- Now I'm only buying you one.

17:42.855 --> 17:45.858
- I hate when people use
the word "condolences."

17:49.361 --> 17:51.612
- I hate it when people tell me
that I'm in their prayers.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.573
Yeah.

17:53.574 --> 17:55.575
I hate how in the beginning,

17:55.576 --> 17:58.369
everyone wants to send you
flowers and donate

17:58.370 --> 18:01.622
to, like, a foundation
for your dead person.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.250
And then they stop calling
and writing

18:04.251 --> 18:06.794
and doing nice things for you
because they're over it,

18:06.795 --> 18:09.547
and they expect you
to be over it.

18:09.548 --> 18:12.925
- I hate it when people ask me
if I was close to my brother...

18:12.926 --> 18:14.802
like they're trying
to decide how sorry

18:14.803 --> 18:16.387
they have to feel for me.

18:16.388 --> 18:18.347
- And they want me to say,
"Not close,"

18:18.348 --> 18:21.100
as if that would make it
better or whatever.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.603
- I hate running into someone
I haven't seen in a long time,

18:23.604 --> 18:25.980
and I know they know he's dead.

18:25.981 --> 18:28.149
But we have
an entire conversation,

18:28.150 --> 18:30.318
and they never bring him up.

18:30.319 --> 18:32.570
They never say they're sorry.

18:32.571 --> 18:35.573
They don't ask how I'm doing.

18:35.574 --> 18:39.035
They just pretend
like everything's fine.

18:39.036 --> 18:40.536
I hate that.

18:40.537 --> 18:43.331
God, that's so good.

18:43.332 --> 18:45.917
- Do you want
another doughnut?

18:45.918 --> 18:47.460
- No.
- Come on.

18:47.461 --> 18:49.754
You want another one.
Yes.

18:49.755 --> 18:51.130
- Yes, I do.
- Yes, you do.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.008
- I would love one.

19:19.451 --> 19:22.245
Jesus.

19:22.246 --> 19:23.663
Oh, God.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.670
Matt.

19:32.714 --> 19:35.175
Matt.

19:49.940 --> 19:52.108
Matt?

20:04.162 --> 20:06.163
- Hey, you reached Matt.
Sorry I missed your call.

20:06.164 --> 20:08.917
Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.674
- Hey, you reached Matt.
Sorry I missed your call.

20:16.675 --> 20:19.136
Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

20:50.125 --> 20:52.335
- Yes.
- Is Matt here?

20:52.336 --> 20:53.961
- Wha...

20:53.962 --> 20:55.546
What time is it?
- Is Matt here?

20:55.547 --> 20:58.216
- No, he went home.
- No, he didn't.

20:58.217 --> 20:59.592
- Well, that's what he said.

20:59.593 --> 21:01.344
We walked back here
from the bar,

21:01.345 --> 21:02.845
and I told him to crash,

21:02.846 --> 21:04.722
but he said he had
to get back to you.

21:04.723 --> 21:06.975
- Was he okay to drive?

21:08.268 --> 21:09.727
- Y-yeah.

21:09.728 --> 21:11.604
- Well, he's not picking up
his phone.

21:11.605 --> 21:13.940
You don't know where he is.
I don't know where he is.

21:13.941 --> 21:15.983
So what am I supposed
to do, Danny?

21:15.984 --> 21:18.986
- Don't yell at me.
I didn't do anything.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.992
Leigh.
Leigh!

22:11.164 --> 22:13.416
- Hey, hey. Hey.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.751
What are you doing?

22:15.752 --> 22:17.920
- I was just waiting
till I was okay to drive.

22:17.921 --> 22:20.840
- I thought you were dead.
- No.

22:20.841 --> 22:23.634
No.

22:23.635 --> 22:27.097
- You can never die.

22:28.807 --> 22:31.684
- No, I won't.
- I'm serious.

22:31.685 --> 22:34.061
I'm serious...
like, ever.

22:35.772 --> 22:38.107
- I think I have to someday.

22:38.108 --> 22:41.444
- Just do it after me.

22:41.445 --> 22:43.779
- Okay.

22:43.780 --> 22:46.073
Okay. Okay.
Hey. Hey. Hey.

22:46.074 --> 22:48.160
I'm here.

22:51.580 --> 22:53.080
- Okay, then.

22:53.081 --> 22:55.208
- So you, uh,
want to hang out sometime?

22:55.209 --> 22:57.001
- Why?

22:57.002 --> 22:58.878
- Never mind.

22:58.879 --> 23:01.005
- No, that's not what...
I actually mean why.

23:01.006 --> 23:03.549
- No, it's okay. Forget it.
You know...

23:03.550 --> 23:06.677
I'm having a shitty enough time
without having to go

23:06.678 --> 23:08.554
through this whole thing
with you, Leigh.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.306
- I'm having
a shitty time, too.

23:10.307 --> 23:12.808
- I'm having an objectively
shittier time than you.

23:12.809 --> 23:13.936
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:13.937 --> 23:15.353
- How is that?

23:15.354 --> 23:17.313
- Because you can get
another husband.

23:17.314 --> 23:19.525
I can't just get
another brother.

23:21.276 --> 23:24.695
Okay.

23:24.696 --> 23:26.948
Oh, wow.

23:26.949 --> 23:29.909
I cannot believe
you just said that.

23:29.910 --> 23:32.119
- It's true.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.288
'Cause you're young.
You'll find someone new.

23:34.289 --> 23:36.541
You'll be fine.
I'm the one who's screwed here.

23:36.542 --> 23:39.377
- Okay, this is why I never
wanted to hang out with you.

23:39.378 --> 23:40.878
Right, and this is why

23:40.879 --> 23:43.756
I still don't want to hang out
with you.

23:43.757 --> 23:47.261
So, Danny, thank you.

24:06.864 --> 24:09.949
- Did you get my stuff?

24:09.950 --> 24:12.410
I want to talk to you.

24:12.411 --> 24:13.911
Cool, that's a no.

24:13.912 --> 24:16.540
- No, I really need you
to listen to me.

24:18.917 --> 24:21.127
I went to your apartment,

24:21.128 --> 24:22.962
and I stood outside the door,

24:22.963 --> 24:24.922
but I didn't go in

24:24.923 --> 24:26.799
because I kept thinking
about this thing

24:26.800 --> 24:29.719
that people say when
they're in the program...

24:29.720 --> 24:32.181
"suit up and show up."

24:34.057 --> 24:36.142
Even if you don't feel like
going to a meeting,

24:36.143 --> 24:39.645
you have to get dressed up
and go.

24:39.646 --> 24:42.315
How you feel about it
doesn't matter.

24:42.316 --> 24:45.194
What matters is that you do it.

24:48.447 --> 24:50.324
I can go with you.

24:51.575 --> 24:53.201
I will.

24:53.202 --> 24:55.786
I will sit with you
for however long it takes

24:55.787 --> 24:57.413
for you to feel like
you can go in,

24:57.414 --> 24:59.917
but I can't go for you.

25:02.211 --> 25:05.213
You have to show up
for yourself.

25:36.787 --> 25:39.747
"Everyone keeps telling me
that I'll get over him.

25:39.748 --> 25:43.751
"Everyone keeps telling me
it's not the end of the world,

25:43.752 --> 25:45.503
"but if that's true,

25:45.504 --> 25:49.466
then why does it feel
like the end of the world?"

25:58.267 --> 26:02.061
"The reason everyone keeps
telling you

26:02.062 --> 26:05.231
"it's not the end of the world

26:05.232 --> 26:08.734
"is because it's not

26:08.735 --> 26:13.155
"the end of their world.

26:13.156 --> 26:16.868
"They don't have to figure out"

26:16.869 --> 26:19.662
"how to live

26:19.663 --> 26:24.084
"inside a world that's over.

26:25.878 --> 26:29.298
You do."

26:54.114 --> 26:56.324
- You're up.

26:56.325 --> 26:58.743
- Yep.

27:57.678 --> 27:59.428
- Why don't we make this

27:59.429 --> 28:01.597
as straightforward as
this impossible thing can be?

28:01.598 --> 28:03.015
Divide everything
into three piles...

28:03.016 --> 28:04.268
keep, toss, and give away.

28:04.269 --> 28:05.768
How does that sound?

28:05.769 --> 28:08.187
- This is the nicest gift

28:08.188 --> 28:10.815
I've ever gotten.

28:10.816 --> 28:15.695
- I think there was a lot
about him I didn't know.

28:15.696 --> 28:18.322
- Nobody really knows anything
about anyone.

28:18.323 --> 28:19.991
- I don't want to fight.
- But...

28:19.992 --> 28:21.951
- You're belongings have
meaning,

28:21.952 --> 28:24.245
and they should be treated with
the respect that they're owed.

28:24.246 --> 28:25.830
- Well, why don't you spend

28:25.831 --> 28:27.707
a week in this place
respecting the objects?

28:27.708 --> 28:29.710
Because if I do that, I'm gonna
throw myself out a window.
