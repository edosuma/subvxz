01:10.153 --> 01:12.322
I think the left side
should be a little lower than that.

01:12.405 --> 01:16.076
Move it to the left. A little down.
That's right. Looking real good.

01:16.159 --> 01:18.995
JOO YEO-JEONG PLASTIC SURGERY

01:25.752 --> 01:27.670
<i>Is it okay if I touch you?</i>

01:29.047 --> 01:30.381
I don't want to startle you.

01:44.604 --> 01:48.108
The button on my sleeve fell off
when I went to the car mechanic's.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.360
Crawling on the floor

01:51.528 --> 01:52.946
like I was crazy.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.951
Aren't they hard to look at?

01:58.952 --> 01:59.869
My scars?

02:00.995 --> 02:01.913
They're injuries.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.295
But if you collapse like that again,

02:09.379 --> 02:10.880
call me so you won't be alone.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.758
I can understand
the burden that anger can be.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.427
I've been there before.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.352
Just wait here.
I'll put a new button on for you.

02:35.613 --> 02:36.614
Sit.

02:52.630 --> 02:53.631
Just trust me.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.509
My sewing is better than
most tailors out there.

03:07.937 --> 03:08.938
Who was it?

03:10.565 --> 03:12.734
The person you needed me
to help beat at Go?

03:16.112 --> 03:19.240
<i>The person you are</i>
<i>trying to reach is unavailable.</i>

03:31.794 --> 03:32.962
There you are.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.757
I thought you weren't home yet.

03:35.840 --> 03:36.799
I'm off to work.

03:41.387 --> 03:42.597
What's this?

03:42.680 --> 03:44.265
Taking a trip down memory lane?

03:44.349 --> 03:47.268
Oh honey, I didn't think
you'd be the one to dig this out.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.270
They're your friends from high school.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.275
Before Hye-jeong
got all that work done.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.695
Well, maybe I should get a boob job too.
Do you think I should?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.530
Son Myeong-o isn't in this picture.

04:01.824 --> 04:02.825
Oh, he's not.

04:05.536 --> 04:08.539
But, honey, how do you know Myeong-o?

04:09.249 --> 04:12.669
Do you often see Jae-jun or Myeong-o?

04:14.921 --> 04:15.797
Sometimes.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.508
Whenever I have a fitting,
I do it at Jae-jun's shop.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.262
But I haven't talked to Myeong-o lately.

04:24.639 --> 04:26.057
Ugh, oh my God.

04:26.557 --> 04:29.102
Sometimes, he does
some really weird stuff.

04:29.727 --> 04:33.189
Did Myeong-o say anything at all odd?
Did he threaten you at all?

04:33.773 --> 04:34.774
What'd he say?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.654
You and your friends

04:39.737 --> 04:41.739
aren't acting normal right now.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.785
Son Myeong-o comes up,
and you all ask if I was threatened.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.079
Get to work safely.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.184
RECENT DESTINATIONS
PLATINUM CC

05:10.935 --> 05:12.437
Did he and Jae-jun meet up?

05:24.907 --> 05:26.075
<i>Ha Do-yeong.</i>

05:26.576 --> 05:28.119
At Jaepyeong Construction.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.413
And he's Yeon-jin's husband.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.000
Why are you interested
in her husband, then?

05:37.879 --> 05:40.048
When I finally get my revenge some day,

05:41.382 --> 05:44.635
Yeong-jin will have
nobody who can be at her side.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.307
Not even her daughter or her husband.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.559
She'll have no one left.

05:53.227 --> 05:55.229
No one she has loved left.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.451
So did you win your match?

06:10.912 --> 06:11.746
Yeah, I won,

06:13.122 --> 06:14.415
but because I had a good teacher.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.757
The passcode is seven-two-four, Dong-eun.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.139
It may take us months or years,

06:30.640 --> 06:32.600
but let's play Go together again.

06:34.018 --> 06:38.189
I'll make a move, and then you can come
whenever you can and make your move.

06:39.148 --> 06:41.401
That way, I'll know you were here.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.238
So then it's okay
if you don't answer my calls.

06:45.321 --> 06:46.989
Just let me know how you are.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.075
That's all I'll ever need.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.830
And then after all of this,
I'll do what you want.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.707
I'll do anything for you.

06:59.001 --> 07:01.087
I'll happily be your executioner.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.248
Hi there.

07:38.166 --> 07:41.043
Is this unusual,
so many young women here now?

07:41.919 --> 07:43.004
The shaman that good?

07:43.796 --> 07:46.007
I can't really say. First time.

07:46.507 --> 07:49.260
I heard from my friend
who was here before,

07:49.343 --> 07:51.304
she'll solve any problem you bring her.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.639
Any problem, huh?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.351
Who do we have here, huh?

07:57.435 --> 07:58.603
Ms. Kang Hyeon-a?

08:00.688 --> 08:02.190
Ms. Kang Hyeon-a?

08:03.191 --> 08:04.275
Kang Hyeon-a!

08:04.358 --> 08:06.569
Here! I'm here.
That's me, right there. Here.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.785
Do you think you can get it out? It's oil.

08:14.869 --> 08:15.870
Sure, I can.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.375
And I can even sew on
a new button for you.

08:23.753 --> 08:24.754
Oh, just…

08:27.340 --> 08:28.341
leave it like that.

08:33.095 --> 08:36.307
I sent a plant to congratulate
Dr. Joo on his new practice.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.018
And this is all the mail
that came in today.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.102
Oh, thank you.

08:41.646 --> 08:42.480
God.

08:43.439 --> 08:45.233
You think he's sent his credit card bills?

That son of a…

10:27.585 --> 10:29.503
Hmm…

10:50.650 --> 10:53.319
One-hundred-eighty-two centimeters.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.364
And 75 kilograms.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.891
Could you
at least try to be more ethical?

12:06.392 --> 12:09.770
Why couldn't you just take my money
instead of meeting in a holy place?

12:11.147 --> 12:12.648
I really like this place.

12:13.607 --> 12:17.319
Makes me think your Heavenly Father
will bless this conversation.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.702
I don't have to count this?

12:26.328 --> 12:27.955
This bitch right here…

12:28.038 --> 12:31.417
You go off to college and now you think
you're better than everyone?

12:32.877 --> 12:34.211
I'll be going now, then.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.465
This arrogant bitch has somewhere to be.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.967
Hey! You won't go to heaven.

12:40.885 --> 12:42.136
But I can still go.

12:42.762 --> 12:46.599
'Cause I've been saved,
since I asked for forgiveness.

12:52.396 --> 12:53.397
God's on your side?

12:54.899 --> 12:55.733
Funny.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.028
I hope you go there when you die,

12:59.111 --> 13:01.363
'cause you'll be in hell
while you're alive.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.160
What did you mean by that?
What else are you gonna do, huh?

13:06.243 --> 13:07.244
Let go now,

13:07.912 --> 13:10.956
or I'll call your father, the minister,
to bless the exchange between us.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.127
Hey! Hey, stop!

13:15.211 --> 13:17.213
I'm talking to you! Hey!

13:17.296 --> 13:18.297
Hey!

13:21.008 --> 13:22.635
Ah, shit!

13:29.850 --> 13:31.435
Are we having our session here?

13:31.936 --> 13:34.063
Today, I'm having you take
an assessment test.

13:34.146 --> 13:37.525
Try. That's all you have to do.
But it'll be easy. I'll wait here.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.193
What kind of assessment?

13:40.528 --> 13:43.113
I'm gonna send you to the U.S. to study.

13:43.781 --> 13:44.949
Study abroad?

13:45.032 --> 13:47.993
Something unexpected happened,
so I can't tutor you anymore.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.288
This way, you'll have a better teacher
that you can study with.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.291
Oh, wow.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.336
Why would you make up a lie that now?

13:58.337 --> 14:00.589
How are you going to send me
to study abroad?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.091
Could you afford to?

14:02.174 --> 14:05.010
Yeah. I just got some money.

14:08.764 --> 14:09.974
Come in, please.

14:12.184 --> 14:14.019
TAIL - DO YOU HAVE THE MONEY?

14:23.070 --> 14:25.322
That was incredible. Nice job, Ye-sol.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.449
Just like Son Heung-min.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.124
But the, uh, kid with the pink socks

14:36.000 --> 14:39.670
really doesn't seem to understand
how to play fair. Somebody could get hurt.

14:40.462 --> 14:41.463
You mean Kim Ji-uk?

14:42.256 --> 14:45.759
Oh, yeah. He always tries
and tackles everyone.

14:48.053 --> 14:48.888
Yeah?

14:48.971 --> 14:53.684
Ah! Daddy, we have
an open class next Friday, Daddy!

14:54.184 --> 14:55.644
It's just for dads.

14:55.728 --> 14:59.607
It's okay if you can't go to it.
I like you when you're busy, too.

15:01.859 --> 15:02.943
No way.

15:03.027 --> 15:04.904
Of course I'm going to go,

15:04.987 --> 15:06.280
even if I'm busy.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.368
Hey, Ye-sol.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.621
Can I ask about your teacher?

15:14.788 --> 15:18.876
Your mom doesn't seem to like her much.
Ye-sol, how about you? You like her?

15:18.959 --> 15:20.711
She's a friend. Why?

15:21.420 --> 15:22.421
Of who?

15:23.255 --> 15:24.089
Yours?

15:24.173 --> 15:26.300
No, my teacher's a friend of Mommy.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.428
They went to the same
high school together.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.349
<i>Ha Do-yeong?</i>

15:33.432 --> 15:36.101
Since when do you care
about Yeon-jin's husband?

15:37.811 --> 15:39.563
Just curious what he's like.

15:39.647 --> 15:41.649
I've realized I don't know him at all.

15:41.732 --> 15:43.567
He's nice, but a son of a bitch.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.071
You always see
assholes like him in first class.

15:47.154 --> 15:50.658
They think flight attendants are
just maids who speak little English.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.078
Fuck that.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.330
You know how many applied for my job, huh?

15:56.413 --> 15:58.332
This is our latest Vera Wang.

15:58.415 --> 15:59.833
This dress has a mermaid silhouette,

15:59.917 --> 16:02.711
meaning it's perfect
for brides with a beautiful figure.

16:08.842 --> 16:11.095
Like it? Look good?

16:12.513 --> 16:13.514
Just my type.

16:14.598 --> 16:15.683
I've got a question.

16:16.392 --> 16:20.396
"Nice son of a bitch" means what, exactly?
How am I any different from that, huh?

16:20.980 --> 16:23.065
Obviously, you're a shithead.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.776
Do-yeon, on the other hand…

16:26.652 --> 16:29.154
You need to look close to know.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.782
He's not trying to be one either.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.702
It's just he's already
so used to ordering people around.

16:35.577 --> 16:36.495
Ah, I see.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.414
That's why his eyes look like that.

16:38.914 --> 16:41.500
Did you and Do-yeong meet up? Why?

16:42.084 --> 16:44.169
Does he know about you and Yeon-jin?

16:46.088 --> 16:47.089
Hye-jeong…

16:48.966 --> 16:49.800
Yeah?

16:49.883 --> 16:52.302
Even if he knew,
you still wouldn't have a chance.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.723
Take the hint already.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.851
However, that dress looks great on you.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.186
You really should get married.

17:02.479 --> 17:05.774
At your age, you'll never find another
boyfriend who'll get you a Vera Wang.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.861
And make sure to ask your boyfriend
where he had his last wedding at.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.738
Maybe they'll give you a discount,

17:10.821 --> 17:11.947
since he's a regular.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.206
He's not the…?

17:21.290 --> 17:22.291
Stop!

17:22.916 --> 17:25.377
Would you like to try on
any of our other dresses?

17:27.671 --> 17:28.964
It's the most expensive?

17:29.590 --> 17:32.426
The chest is really fucking tight,
so you need to fix it!

17:51.028 --> 17:52.362
That asshole.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.672
Yeon-jin's is smaller than mine.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.299
Definitely.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.759
So what's wrong?

18:21.433 --> 18:24.186
Snow White chose
to live with seven men, did she not?

18:24.978 --> 18:25.813
Why?

18:26.688 --> 18:29.024
Because she knew
they were mining for gold.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.693
DOES ANYBODY KNOW
WHERE THAT BASTARD MYEONG-O LIVES?

19:01.640 --> 19:03.350
<i>The person</i>
<i>you're trying to reach…</i>

19:03.433 --> 19:04.268
Ah, shit.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.937
<i>Where are you?</i>
<i>Definitely not at home!</i>

19:07.020 --> 19:08.897
<i>Did you actually meet with Do-yeong?</i>

19:10.190 --> 19:11.942
<i>He had your golf club's address</i>

INCOMING CALL
JAE-JUN

19:35.632 --> 19:37.551
Why the hell are you
not answering my calls?

19:38.343 --> 19:39.970
You ignored my calls first, didn't you?

19:40.053 --> 19:42.097
I was busy. You see the text?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.224
<i>We should meet up. Where are you?</i>

19:44.308 --> 19:45.475
Sure, later.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.686
I'm not in Seoul. I'm at a family reunion.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.524
Ye-sol!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.117
Ye-sol!

20:56.129 --> 20:57.047
I'm sorry.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.299
But I was so happy to see you.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.302
Don't worry.
I know how to cross the road, too.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.221
It's okay.

21:04.721 --> 21:06.139
Where's Mommy?

21:06.223 --> 21:09.226
Oh I just came to visit you on my own.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.813
Ah, what does Ye-sol like?

21:12.896 --> 21:15.440
Maybe video games? Dolls?

21:15.524 --> 21:18.360
Trading stocks. Samsung or even Kakao.

21:18.944 --> 21:19.820
Huh?

21:19.903 --> 21:21.238
I'm just joking.

21:21.738 --> 21:24.658
Mommy told me to say that
if anyone asked me.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.911
Ah.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.331
Hey, you're only eight
and you understand a joke like that?

21:31.415 --> 21:32.916
Wow, that's fucking gre…

21:35.711 --> 21:37.129
You're a very smart girl.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.841
Ah, little genius.

21:40.924 --> 21:43.010
I wonder which parent Ye-sol takes after.

21:47.764 --> 21:49.641
Can't they tell
this is a fucking school zone?

21:49.725 --> 21:51.685
I'm going to cut off
their goddamn hands. Shit.

21:51.768 --> 21:53.437
Don't you see there's a kid, huh?

22:03.030 --> 22:04.448
I know what I'm going to do.

22:05.699 --> 22:06.950
I've made up my mind now.

22:08.118 --> 22:09.745
From now on, I'll protect you.

22:13.415 --> 22:14.541
I love you, Ye-sol.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.758
Ugh, that smells.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.345
What happened?

22:27.763 --> 22:29.973
Did he run away or give up half-way?

22:32.559 --> 22:34.478
I can't believe this moron.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.147
He really stole this from Jae-jin?

22:43.111 --> 22:44.112
Shit!

22:44.196 --> 22:45.989
Bitch, shouldn't you be at church now?

22:46.073 --> 22:48.533
You see, I can pray
anytime, anywhere with this.

22:48.617 --> 22:51.787
I wanted to know who'd come.
Turns out it's Sister Hye-jeong.

22:51.870 --> 22:54.998
You crazy bitch.
Why do you care who comes or not

22:55.082 --> 22:59.002
Don't you know? The perpetrator will
return to the scene of their own crime,

22:59.086 --> 22:59.920
always.

23:00.003 --> 23:01.129
Oh, fuck off.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.340
So Myeong-o isn't here?

23:03.423 --> 23:05.509
-Did you make this big mess?
-Mm-hmm..

23:06.009 --> 23:07.761
Just knock,
and the door will open for you.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.596
So I knocked, and it opened wide for me.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.723
Look. My prayers are answered.

23:11.807 --> 23:12.849
Stop. Get it away.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.019
God damn it. I need to see him.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.939
If he comes to my wedding
and shows weird pictures,

23:19.022 --> 23:20.273
I'm going to be screwed.

23:20.357 --> 23:22.484
Why would he try to screw you over?

23:23.068 --> 23:24.486
Because he couldn't have me.

23:25.153 --> 23:27.155
Hey, you know what that jerk told me?

23:27.239 --> 23:30.200
No idea. Look at this.
I think he went on a trip.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.284
Trip?

23:32.577 --> 23:33.787
Vladivostok?

23:33.870 --> 23:35.288
Why are you going to Russia?

23:35.372 --> 23:38.291
Ah. You finally decided to be a dog?

23:38.375 --> 23:39.459
A little sled doggy?

23:39.543 --> 23:40.377
What?

23:41.169 --> 23:43.088
He was actually going to Russia, then?

23:44.381 --> 23:45.424
Why didn't he go?

23:45.507 --> 23:48.218
Ah, fuck me. Was I actually the reason?

23:48.301 --> 23:50.720
-He didn't go?
-You're holding his passport.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.062
What the fuck
are you screaming for, pussy? Shit.

23:59.146 --> 24:01.022
I know you're there!
Your lights are on!

24:01.106 --> 24:03.233
Come on, open this door!

24:03.316 --> 24:05.152
Didn't you say you
were in a hurry to leave?

24:05.235 --> 24:08.572
Then why aren't you answering me?
I have people who want to see your room!

24:14.119 --> 24:15.704
What's wrong? What's going on?

24:15.787 --> 24:17.831
-He's dead.
-See our message?

24:17.914 --> 24:19.791
What are you saying? Slow down a bit.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.418
Myeong-o seems to have gone missing.

24:21.501 --> 24:24.254
We went to his apartment,
and his landlord couldn't reach him.

24:24.337 --> 24:27.340
He was moving out,
and even had a plane ticket, too.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.718
-It's just weird.
-So then, call the police.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.721
You report something like that
to the police, not me.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.973
Report? Don't report?

24:35.474 --> 24:37.976
Why? All we're saying
is that it looks weird.

24:38.059 --> 24:41.730
Yeah, Sara's right.
And besides, I'm getting married soon.

24:41.813 --> 24:43.315
I can't be seen at a police station.

24:43.398 --> 24:44.900
Then, why me?

24:45.400 --> 24:47.611
I'm supposed to be at the news van now.

24:49.279 --> 24:50.280
So then,

24:51.072 --> 24:54.618
did Myeong-o not call
either of you guys before he left?

25:03.502 --> 25:04.753
Well, I called him often.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.172
He's Jae-jun's driver.

25:09.299 --> 25:11.343
When exactly did you last talk to him?

25:11.426 --> 25:14.763
I guess sometime around the 19th or 20th.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.349
Why are you asking?

25:18.558 --> 25:21.478
I got a weird-ass call
from him that day.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.773
So I was wondering
if you guys did too.

25:27.234 --> 25:28.610
Like how? Why was it weird?

25:29.528 --> 25:31.112
I got a call too.

25:31.613 --> 25:34.741
You did? Tell me. What did he say to you?

25:35.867 --> 25:39.579
Nothing. Kept going on about sending
some stupid gift, so I hung up.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.498
He wasn't making any sense.

25:41.581 --> 25:43.750
So, he gave you a gift?

25:47.170 --> 25:50.173
And I got a fucking stupid "I love you"!

25:50.257 --> 25:53.760
That son of a bitch told me he loves me
and asked me to visit him soon.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.762
Does he think I'm crazy or what?

25:56.263 --> 25:58.890
Ugh, I'm getting so pissed off
thinking about it.

25:58.974 --> 26:02.310
I mean, how dare he think he has a chance?

26:02.394 --> 26:04.187
He thinks we're on the same level?

26:13.863 --> 26:16.032
Tell me, what the hell
did you do to Myeong-o?

26:16.116 --> 26:18.118
to have him do something like that, huh?

26:18.618 --> 26:19.703
He's punishing you.

26:19.786 --> 26:21.788
That's so fucking funny.

26:21.871 --> 26:22.789
I'm going now.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.458
I'll be on the news truck, so don't call.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.295
It now makes sense.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.505
I was wondering
how you knew his door code.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.382
69-69-69.

26:32.465 --> 26:35.135
And what about you?
How did you know the code?

26:35.218 --> 26:38.972
I've been there a few times. I just can't
even remember how exactly I got there.

26:39.055 --> 26:40.974
I'm sure you two would look cute together.

26:41.057 --> 26:42.892
Fuck you! It's not like that!

26:47.439 --> 26:50.025
<i>Saturday at 3:00 p.m.</i>
<i>Locker number C-7.</i>

26:50.108 --> 26:51.985
<i>Passcode's 48-85.</i>

26:54.863 --> 26:57.407
STORAGE AND DELIVERY

27:45.789 --> 27:48.041
RÉSUMÉ
AN JEONG-MI

27:48.875 --> 27:50.460
Ms. An Jeong-mi, right?

27:51.670 --> 27:54.089
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.924
I've heard a lot about you.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.634
I'm looking forward to it.

27:57.717 --> 27:58.718
Me too.

28:00.470 --> 28:01.805
I look forward to it, too.

28:02.389 --> 28:03.640
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

28:05.016 --> 28:06.393
I'm feeling pretty good.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.645
I've been sleeping well
and I'm working out.

28:09.729 --> 28:13.066
Someone told me you opened
a practice in Semyeong. Congratulations.

28:13.566 --> 28:14.484
Thank you, ma'am.

28:15.402 --> 28:17.404
I just regret
that I didn't listen to you sooner,

28:17.487 --> 28:19.447
when you said
I should change my environment.

28:19.948 --> 28:21.908
That's good. Are you eating well?

28:22.492 --> 28:24.577
Semyeong has quite a few
great restaurants.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.247
Does it still bring you comfort

28:27.330 --> 28:29.958
when you listen
to the sound of tablets dissolving?

28:33.837 --> 28:35.046
This is goodbye, ma'am.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.215
I don't think I'll be back.

28:37.924 --> 28:40.635
It's only a two-hour trip
that you'd make once a month.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.137
Is it too much?

28:43.763 --> 28:45.390
It's not because of how far it is.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.686
I've decided it's time to leave
because you weren't able to fix me at all.

30:03.510 --> 30:06.262
<i>So what kind of shit</i>
<i>did you get yourself into this time?</i>

30:06.346 --> 30:08.348
You asshole. Don't call it shit.

30:09.182 --> 30:10.350
It's not like that this time.

30:14.771 --> 30:17.440
I have something
that is very small and precious.

30:18.316 --> 30:21.236
-And I wanna take it from someone.
<i>-What do you mean precious?</i>

30:21.319 --> 30:24.489
A jewel?
Are you going around stealing things now?

30:24.572 --> 30:27.075
Fuck you. I'm just trying
to get back what's mine.

30:29.786 --> 30:30.703
Come on, man.

30:31.996 --> 30:32.914
Just hear me out.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.126
Right. I'll get straight to the point.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.254
No way. It's impossible.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.840
-You can't have the kid.
-And why's that?

30:42.841 --> 30:44.092
I'm Ye-sol's father, aren't I?

30:44.175 --> 30:46.427
Biologically, yeah. Not legally.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.263
When a child is born during a marriage,

30:48.346 --> 30:51.015
they are legally considered
to belong to the married couple's.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.934
That means her real father's Ha Do-yeong.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.062
God damn. That's not fucking fair.

30:56.145 --> 30:57.438
Even with a DNA test?

30:58.356 --> 31:02.277
-A 99% match. Isn't it science?
-Well, would you waste your time on that?

31:02.360 --> 31:05.363
Even if it was 990 instead of 99%,

31:05.446 --> 31:07.866
as long as the legal father
doesn't abandon them,

31:07.949 --> 31:09.284
you'll always be second rate.

31:10.118 --> 31:14.289
Son of a bitch. Can you at least try
and file a lawsuit or whatever? Something?

31:14.372 --> 31:16.583
I'm saying you don't even
have the grounds to file one.

31:16.666 --> 31:18.167
You're a third party, not considered--

31:18.251 --> 31:21.004
Why am I a third party?
I'm her real father. Shit.

31:21.087 --> 31:25.425
What kind of
fucked-up law even is that?

31:26.551 --> 31:29.387
You might have a chance
for a law suit against them

31:29.470 --> 31:32.307
if it's clear that the legal guardians
were unable to have a child,

31:32.390 --> 31:34.684
like if one of them
was locked up in prison,

31:34.767 --> 31:36.227
or away on a trip when conceived.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.021
Is it possible?

31:41.357 --> 31:43.359
It's not. They're fucking lovebirds.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.612
Then has the father abused the child?

31:47.030 --> 31:48.948
If he were abusing her,
why would I call you?

31:49.032 --> 31:50.450
I would just call the cops.

31:50.533 --> 31:51.618
Well,

31:52.744 --> 31:55.830
in this situation,
your best scenario won't be a lawsuit.

31:56.664 --> 31:57.999
It's the mother getting a divorce.

31:58.958 --> 32:01.711
Child custody would be
a whole different matter.

32:07.383 --> 32:08.426
A divorce?

32:08.509 --> 32:10.803
I went over
to the shaman's shop,

32:10.887 --> 32:13.056
but I haven't found
anything worthwhile yet.

32:13.806 --> 32:16.309
After I visit a few more times,
I'll get you more info.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.102
Also…

32:18.728 --> 32:20.980
So are you about to pull out more eggs?

32:21.731 --> 32:22.565
Oh, not at all!

32:24.233 --> 32:25.526
Hey look, what's that?

32:28.363 --> 32:30.323
So, that rental car?

32:31.115 --> 32:33.534
I think we may actually have something.

32:46.214 --> 32:48.549
<i>After I followed them</i>
<i>from the storage lockers,</i>

32:48.633 --> 32:51.636
<i>they drove down the expressway</i>
<i>for what felt like forever.</i>

32:52.136 --> 32:54.722
<i>But then, they finally stopped at a motel.</i>

32:59.018 --> 33:03.064
<i>And just as I started to wonder</i>
<i>if I should just drive back,</i>

33:04.190 --> 33:05.441
guess who appeared?

33:10.571 --> 33:14.367
Yeah. That's the cop who goes
to the shaman's with Yeon-jin's mom.

33:14.867 --> 33:16.327
They're all working together.

33:16.953 --> 33:18.037
That's huge, right?

33:19.539 --> 33:21.791
Wow, even now, I'm still not scared.

33:21.874 --> 33:24.794
It's been getting me thinking,

33:25.294 --> 33:27.296
If I ever happen to get reborn,

33:27.380 --> 33:28.381
I want to be a spy.

33:29.465 --> 33:33.428
And then I would wear red lipstick
and a cool jacket, too.

33:33.511 --> 33:37.098
If you want, you could put on
red lipstick in this lifetime, too.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.892
-Oh, you think?
-But regarding Son Myeong-o,

33:39.976 --> 33:41.352
I don't think he just went missing.

33:41.436 --> 33:43.855
Oh, me wear red lipstick?

33:45.648 --> 33:47.483
Wait, you don't think he went missing?

33:47.567 --> 33:49.610
Do you think Son Myeong-o…

33:49.694 --> 33:53.322
That he actually… was murdered?

33:54.949 --> 33:58.202
Those people might be
Park Yeon-jin's hired thugs

33:58.703 --> 33:59.954
who work outside the law.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.290
Park Yeon-jin doesn't have
an in with the police.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.876
Rather, it's that
they rely on her influence.

34:06.419 --> 34:09.589
Hold on, wait. "Outside the law."
Do you mean that…

34:10.548 --> 34:14.010
Yeah. Son Myeong-o disappeared
because of them.

34:15.928 --> 34:19.015
Myeong-o went off on his own
because he didn't trust me,

34:19.098 --> 34:20.850
and since he bought a plane ticket…

34:21.601 --> 34:24.187
that means he must have met with Yeon-jin.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.230
Then he disappeared.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.525
So what should we do now?

34:33.279 --> 34:36.282
What did you really want
from that Son Myeong-o, ma'am?

34:42.330 --> 34:44.332
But now we're together in the same boat.

34:44.916 --> 34:48.002
Which one of those four killed So-hee?

34:56.010 --> 34:57.095
Park Yeong-jin.

35:02.934 --> 35:03.768
Yes!

35:05.061 --> 35:05.895
Hold on…

35:07.146 --> 35:10.149
I'm sure Yeon-jin already knows
she's at that hospital.

35:11.901 --> 35:14.904
Do you have proof?
How can you prove she did it?

35:19.158 --> 35:22.161
So-hee has this tag
in her hand when she fell that day.

35:22.245 --> 35:25.164
PARK YEON-JIN

35:29.043 --> 35:30.419
How do you have this thing?

35:33.631 --> 35:34.882
That day, you there, huh?

35:36.801 --> 35:38.302
And now, you were there with me.

35:42.723 --> 35:44.392
Because we're in this together, right?

35:45.434 --> 35:46.269
Wow.

35:47.687 --> 35:48.688
Wow, fuck yeah!

35:55.278 --> 35:56.445
This is crazy.

35:57.738 --> 35:59.407
Hey, so, a billion won?

35:59.490 --> 36:02.160
Call me when you arrange
a meeting with Park Yeon-jin.

36:02.243 --> 36:03.995
And on that day,
I'll give you the name tag.

36:06.789 --> 36:10.334
Not matter the price you give,
that money will be all yours.

36:12.795 --> 36:14.297
I want something else.

36:15.173 --> 36:17.175
What do you want? Tell me now.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.303
Yeon-jin's confession.

36:22.138 --> 36:24.140
If it worked and Myeong-o got the money,

36:24.974 --> 36:26.100
that would've been it.

36:27.101 --> 36:31.022
He told me that he would record
every single step for me.

36:34.066 --> 36:38.446
Didn't you say that it was
declared as a suicide?

36:39.363 --> 36:41.365
Do you think it could change things?

36:42.909 --> 36:45.244
And that's why I wanted
to make her an outcast.

36:46.787 --> 36:48.789
I wouldn't have the legal advantage.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.708
I thought I'd let the world know

36:51.542 --> 36:53.878
exactly what she did
by hearing her confession.

36:56.005 --> 36:59.050
I want her to burn
for the rest of eternity,

36:59.926 --> 37:01.427
oozing pus from her wounds.

37:02.345 --> 37:05.681
She'd never be able to laugh,
and she'd never have peace again.

37:09.143 --> 37:13.272
But can you even get
Park Yeon-jin's confession at this point?

37:15.107 --> 37:18.236
It's not like we can
go looking for Myeong-o's body.

37:18.736 --> 37:19.820
So what now?

37:22.990 --> 37:24.283
We'll have to find him first.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.327
But how?

37:27.328 --> 37:28.746
Please keep still.

37:35.294 --> 37:38.172
What exactly will this exam tell me?

37:38.256 --> 37:41.467
It's a 12-panel STD test,
so it will catch most things.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.719
An HPV test was also added here,

37:43.803 --> 37:46.264
so you can be better-informed.

37:46.347 --> 37:47.682
Nothing else, though?

37:48.266 --> 37:49.850
That's all that'll show, right?

37:52.478 --> 37:54.522
Here are the documents you requested.

37:54.605 --> 37:57.275
My family's genealogy map,
my college transcripts,

37:57.358 --> 37:59.068
my OB-GYN exam.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.153
You could've emailed this.

38:01.237 --> 38:03.239
Nobody carries paper copies anymore.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.992
That's fine. I'll look at these later.

38:07.952 --> 38:10.037
-What bank do you primarily use?
-Sorry?

38:10.121 --> 38:11.747
There's no way that I'll be able to stand

38:11.831 --> 38:13.666
looking at a bank account
with so many zeros.

38:13.749 --> 38:14.875
Just give me the name.

38:14.959 --> 38:16.335
I'll take care of the rest.

38:16.419 --> 38:18.421
Is that Ms. Moon?

38:18.504 --> 38:20.298
Ms. Moon, dear!

38:21.882 --> 38:24.427
Oh! It's so great to see you!

38:24.510 --> 38:25.761
How long's it been?

38:27.179 --> 38:28.764
You're even prettier now!

38:33.436 --> 38:34.437
Choi Hye-jeong?

38:38.774 --> 38:41.736
You know each other?
This is my son's girlfriend.

38:41.819 --> 38:44.572
Ah, the two of us went to school together.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.407
Ah.

38:46.490 --> 38:49.160
I guess I shouldn't make her jealous
'cause I'm friends with you.

38:49.243 --> 38:50.953
No! What are you saying?

38:51.037 --> 38:53.247
What she does has
nothing at all to do with you.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.166
Don't make me cry, dear.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.793
We're getting dinner ready
over at the temple.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.129
If you're available, Ms. Moon,
you should come join us.

39:00.212 --> 39:01.714
I'm sorry, I have plans later.

39:03.716 --> 39:05.051
So you're getting married?

39:06.093 --> 39:07.094
Congrats.

39:12.933 --> 39:15.478
The next time I visit,
I'll try to be here earlier, okay?

39:15.936 --> 39:17.813
Okay, that sounds good. I'll see you.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.236
I really wish she was Tae-uk's wife.

39:30.451 --> 39:31.952
Ugh, I'm stuck with this brat!

39:33.621 --> 39:36.374
How come you didn't go and say hello, hmm?

39:36.457 --> 39:38.125
Ms. Moon looked very happy to see you.

39:41.128 --> 39:44.215
I just wasn't expecting her.
We weren't really that close.

39:45.674 --> 39:47.176
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

39:54.016 --> 39:56.268
Hey, Dong-eun!

39:57.061 --> 39:59.313
I'm so sorry we didn't get
a chance to talk back there.

39:59.397 --> 40:03.067
It's too funny,
running into you out here.

40:03.150 --> 40:04.443
Great seeing you.

40:06.278 --> 40:08.864
Can we talk real quick? Huh?

40:12.284 --> 40:13.119
Okay.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.834
What the hell have you been doing?

40:20.835 --> 40:22.253
Why won't you pick up your phone?

40:22.962 --> 40:24.839
You have any idea how many times I called?

40:24.922 --> 40:25.965
Seventeen times.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.467
By the way, Yeon-jin,

40:29.969 --> 40:32.054
isn't there something
you'd like to tell me?

40:32.638 --> 40:33.639
Like what?

40:35.266 --> 40:36.892
Why were you and Do-yeong together?

40:37.476 --> 40:40.604
-You really have nothing to tell me?
-Don't change the subject!

40:41.105 --> 40:43.482
Who arranged the meeting first?
You or Do-yeong?

40:51.490 --> 40:53.117
I didn't ask him to see me.

40:55.744 --> 40:59.081
Your Do-yeong came to me first
asking where the fuck Myeong-o was,

40:59.165 --> 41:00.624
so answer me right now!

41:04.003 --> 41:05.713
You really have nothing to say to me?

41:07.506 --> 41:08.507
To you?

41:09.967 --> 41:12.219
Like how Dong-eun is Ye-sol's teacher?

41:15.097 --> 41:17.850
So, I didn't know that.
I'm looking for something else.

41:17.933 --> 41:19.101
Then say it, would you?

41:20.853 --> 41:22.271
Just tell me exactly what I'm--

41:27.401 --> 41:28.569
Are you crazy?!

41:28.652 --> 41:29.653
No.

41:30.654 --> 41:31.822
You're who's crazy.

41:31.906 --> 41:33.782
How dare you raise
my daughter as Do-yeong's?

41:35.034 --> 41:36.035
Answer me this.

41:36.619 --> 41:39.246
Did you find out she was mine
after you gave birth?

41:40.206 --> 41:42.917
Or you already knew
she was Jeon Ye-sol, not Ha Ye-Sol?

41:45.252 --> 41:46.629
Honestly, I'm just curious.

41:48.756 --> 41:52.051
I just want to know why you stayed married
even though you had my daughter,

41:52.134 --> 41:53.219
why you abandoned me,

41:54.178 --> 41:55.763
if you knew the truth.

41:57.097 --> 41:58.098
Did…

42:01.060 --> 42:02.186
you ever love me?

42:07.233 --> 42:10.069
If I burst a blood vein, I can't go on TV!

43:09.503 --> 43:12.047
Hi, honey!
You having fun? That looks great.

43:25.477 --> 43:26.812
Seo-u! Seo-u.

43:35.738 --> 43:39.241
Seeing each other a lot.
We'll be friends pretty soon.

43:40.326 --> 43:41.327
Why are you here?

43:44.997 --> 43:46.874
Turns out I have a secret love child.

43:51.462 --> 43:52.379
I'm just kidding.

43:53.589 --> 43:55.049
Just came to see a friend.

44:00.512 --> 44:01.847
I'm not here for you.

44:19.490 --> 44:20.824
It's nice to meet you all.

44:21.325 --> 44:24.161
I'm the homeroom teacher,
Ms. Moon Dong-eun.

44:29.917 --> 44:31.835
We went to the same high school.

44:32.795 --> 44:34.797
Moon Dong-eun. The homeroom teacher.

44:41.970 --> 44:46.433
I heard Yeon-jin went
to the same high school as you.

44:47.601 --> 44:48.769
Yeon-jin told you that?

44:49.603 --> 44:51.021
Those two weren't friends.

44:51.605 --> 44:53.399
But I'm guessing she was friends with you?

44:54.650 --> 44:58.320
Well, you might even say
we could see each other's true side.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.198
I know everything about her.

45:01.281 --> 45:04.410
Huh. Even what she looks like
under her clothes.

45:10.040 --> 45:13.001
Hey, I've been so curious about something.

45:15.212 --> 45:16.213
Have you

45:18.424 --> 45:20.259
ever had something taken from you?

45:35.691 --> 45:38.026
Now,
let's begin class for the day.
