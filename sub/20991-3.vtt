WEBVTT

00:43.119 --> 00:44.719
- Are they inside ?
- Yes.

00:57.439 --> 00:58.520
What is this ?

00:58.600 --> 01:01.079
Daniel offered this painting
to the parish.

01:01.920 --> 01:05.040
- When ?
- A few months before he died.

01:09.200 --> 01:13.840
- And you didn't say anything ?
- Only when I saw Kuba...

01:14.200 --> 01:16.159
What about Abraham ?
I told you.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.599
- Don't ! You can't do it.
- Why not ?

01:22.519 --> 01:24.959
Is there anything else
you haven't told us ?

01:33.359 --> 01:34.519
What's he shouting ?

01:41.200 --> 01:42.959
Motherfucker, you deserved it.

01:44.239 --> 01:46.120
I was sure
he was shouting at me.

01:48.519 --> 01:50.319
That he was blaming me...

01:53.040 --> 01:55.159
June 3rd is the day of Dad's death.

02:01.840 --> 02:05.359
I got it from Molenda
a few weeks later.

02:07.560 --> 02:08.800
We have to talk to him.

02:20.599 --> 02:21.560
Mum.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.360
We need to find the painter,
he might know something.

02:47.280 --> 02:52.560
Here's a fresh towel, go to sleep.
We'll check it tomorrow.

03:37.639 --> 03:38.639
Are you awake ?

05:35.600 --> 05:37.720
PAKT
Episode 3

06:00.319 --> 06:01.319
Please, follow me.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.160
Please let me know
when you have finished.

06:57.959 --> 06:58.920
Hi.

06:59.800 --> 07:02.639
- Did you sleep well ?
- Not really.

07:06.600 --> 07:10.319
I searched the fire service registers
from the last fifteen years.

07:10.399 --> 07:11.360
And ?

07:13.079 --> 07:14.759
There were nineteen fires,

07:14.839 --> 07:17.279
in which children died
but none was him.

07:19.639 --> 07:21.480
Maybe it didn't happen in Poland ?

07:25.319 --> 07:30.319
- Anyway, it was never reported.
- So we're screwed.

07:31.959 --> 07:34.319
Not necessarily.
I found something else.

07:36.040 --> 07:39.399
That video file.
General attributes of the file

07:39.480 --> 07:42.480
are different from the metadata
of the video stream.

07:43.040 --> 07:47.600
- And in more understandable terms ?
- Someone falsified its creation date.

07:47.680 --> 07:50.040
In fact, it was created
only a few days ago.

07:52.439 --> 07:53.720
It wasn't Daniel.

07:54.639 --> 07:56.839
He wasn't the one
who sent you this film.

08:00.399 --> 08:01.519
Thank you.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.720
See you soon...
God bless you.

08:09.600 --> 08:12.600
A normal person
wouldn't have done such a thing.

08:16.279 --> 08:17.720
We'll talk in the evening.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.480
I have to go, I'm already late.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.439
Will you manage ?

08:53.720 --> 08:55.519
What are your plans for today ?

09:00.879 --> 09:02.080
Young man.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.039
None.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.080
We don't hire a maid here.

09:37.879 --> 09:39.039
Can I go now ?

10:09.200 --> 10:10.279
Is the Notary in ?

10:10.360 --> 10:12.480
He's just gone out.
How can I help you ?

10:14.840 --> 10:16.559
What do you think you're doing ?

10:20.600 --> 10:21.840
Please leave now !

10:27.000 --> 10:28.320
All right, I'm leaving.

10:31.440 --> 10:32.799
Stop, will you ? Pull up.

10:36.759 --> 10:38.840
- You recognise me ?
- What can I do for you ?

10:39.519 --> 10:41.639
Two days ago...
Daniel Grodecki...

10:41.720 --> 10:44.039
The package from beyond the grave,
you recognise me ?

10:44.120 --> 10:45.519
Certainly.
Something happened ?

10:46.360 --> 10:48.960
Who gave it to you ?
For sure it wasn't my brother.

10:49.039 --> 10:51.120
And not a year
but a few days ago.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.440
No, I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.399
Would you excuse me,
I'm already a bit late.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.879
I have a longstory
on what's going on here.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.519
Letters of authority
issued by the deceased,

11:06.600 --> 11:08.960
whose properties unexpectedly
change the owner.

11:09.039 --> 11:11.519
The article's ready,
waiting to be printed.

11:11.919 --> 11:14.360
Yeah ?
Go ahead and print it.

11:16.399 --> 11:18.639
Remember to buy Kurier
the day after tomorrow.

11:23.879 --> 11:24.799
Grodecki !

11:31.159 --> 11:33.519
- What guarantee do I have ?
- My word for now.

11:38.320 --> 11:41.360
- Are you recording this ?
- You can search me if you want to.

11:44.440 --> 11:48.200
I got a call and an order.
From an anonymous person.

11:49.639 --> 11:52.039
Then I got the package
and specific instructions and...

11:55.559 --> 11:59.440
And money.
Big enough to ignore the details.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.960
Where did the package come from ?
Did they leave any trace ?

12:05.639 --> 12:08.399
If someone wants to remain
anonymous, you won't find them.

12:09.519 --> 12:11.159
You should know that by now.

12:15.279 --> 12:18.440
- What guarantee do I have ?
- We have nothing on you.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.799
So that's what
we're writing about now ?

12:29.879 --> 12:31.679
We're getting into people's beds,
is that right ?

12:31.759 --> 12:33.279
Not people but the minister.

12:33.360 --> 12:35.480
If it's OK with the Minister,
it's OK with you.

12:35.799 --> 12:38.600
Andrzej, we're the Fourth Estate.
We have to reveal things...

12:38.679 --> 12:40.879
We're supposed
to protect civil rights.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.120
But instead,
we severely infringe them.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.080
Can you leave us alone
for a moment ?

12:51.840 --> 12:53.360
The guy's lying in his private life.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.480
Why should we trust him
in the public one ?

12:55.559 --> 12:57.639
It's the best Minister of Economy
we've had for years.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.919
He's a liar.
And it's not about politics.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.080
- It's the matter of ethics.
- He's going to sue us.

13:02.159 --> 13:04.519
And he will win.
And then he'll ruin us.

13:04.919 --> 13:05.879
He won't.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.840
We're having trouble
with closing the budget gap.

13:16.919 --> 13:17.919
Thisis Skalski.

13:19.519 --> 13:21.320
Rumour has it
that things are improving.

13:23.480 --> 13:24.720
And this is Bogusz.

13:24.799 --> 13:28.159
They are, kind of, but slowly
and we're short of money as usual.

13:28.240 --> 13:33.000
Maybe we have to act differently,
as they say now: 'outside the box.'

13:33.639 --> 13:35.960
So you're gonna fucking sack
the Minister of Finance at last.

13:36.039 --> 13:37.799
- And this ?
- Nawrot.

13:38.519 --> 13:40.480
Good, you should've done it
a long time ago.

13:40.559 --> 13:43.679
The prick thinks he's got a longer one
than he really has.

13:43.759 --> 13:45.240
All right, let's drop this.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.000
This oxtail in sauce is exquisite.

13:50.240 --> 13:53.759
What is this ?! We're going to expose
the Minister's weak spot for oxtails.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.519
Wait, listen to this.

13:58.279 --> 14:00.480
The government won't give you
such guarantees.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.279
But we have to.
Look, it's a huge investment...

14:04.360 --> 14:07.080
It's your problem.
I can't help you.

14:08.159 --> 14:10.919
- You have to.
- I don't have to do anything.

14:11.000 --> 14:13.639
- Sure, you don't but you can.
- No way.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.120
Easy. Let me finish. We give
money, you are a silent partner.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.679
Such a guarantee is good enough
for the Chinese.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.879
What money are we talking about ?

14:25.879 --> 14:27.919
If we sign the deal
with the Chinese ?

14:28.559 --> 14:33.759
Let's say this
and then twenty percent of the profit.

14:35.679 --> 14:38.039
All right, I'm in.

14:39.159 --> 14:40.679
It was eighteen months ago.

14:41.399 --> 14:45.039
One week later, Boguszand Nawrot
set up a company Pek-War

14:45.440 --> 14:48.720
with the share capital
of half a million zlotys.

14:50.159 --> 14:51.519
In the latest quarter,

14:51.600 --> 14:53.559
they reported revenue
of as much as twenty million.

14:54.480 --> 14:57.960
- Where did you get this ?
- I can't... My source...

14:58.039 --> 15:00.840
- Where did you get this ?
- We trust Monika, don't we ?

15:01.200 --> 15:03.879
And what if it's a fix ?
A piece of shit with a ribbon on it.

15:03.960 --> 15:05.879
Cut it out.
You've heard the recording.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.919
OK. So it's a sequel
to the tape scandal.

15:09.960 --> 15:13.080
Someone illegally recorded
the Minister's conversations.

15:13.159 --> 15:15.320
Forgive me but I need to know:
who and what for.

15:15.399 --> 15:18.159
Everything in its right time.
Great job, Monika, congratulations.

15:18.919 --> 15:22.440
Modern journalism. You're fucking
puppets in someone's hands.

15:23.039 --> 15:25.720
Andrzej, let go just this once.

15:44.399 --> 15:45.480
Don't read this.

16:10.399 --> 16:11.360
Listen...

17:00.799 --> 17:02.320
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.480
- Today's agenda.
- Cancel everything.

17:06.000 --> 17:07.119
Sorry ?

17:07.200 --> 17:10.759
Cancel everything.
We're going to see the Prime Minister.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.680
He was a promising judoka.

17:41.559 --> 17:43.480
Actually, he was good at everything.

17:52.440 --> 17:53.839
But he screwed up everything.

17:56.039 --> 17:57.279
You know who this is ?

17:59.200 --> 18:00.200
Grandma.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.039
I've heard she killed herself
because of you.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.640
Is that
what your father told you ?

18:09.160 --> 18:11.039
And you believed in everything.

18:17.599 --> 18:18.559
Our relic.

18:22.640 --> 18:24.640
Your father stuck it in my belly.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.200
Up to this point.

18:34.519 --> 18:36.079
He didn't tell you that ?

18:39.720 --> 18:43.759
- He was your age.
- Maybe he had his reasons.

18:51.440 --> 18:52.599
How did this happen ?

18:57.240 --> 18:59.039
Why ?
You don't find it interesting.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.519
- Hi.
- You can never be on time, can you ?

19:37.680 --> 19:39.519
It must be somewhere here.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.920
Grodecki Daniel.

19:46.960 --> 19:53.000
It's here. March 5th 2014,
Ash Wednesday.

19:54.880 --> 19:58.079
- And he just brought it here ?
- It was hardly a coincidence.

19:59.880 --> 20:03.319
- Meaning ?
- Ash Wednesday is a day of penance.

20:04.559 --> 20:07.440
He donated the painting
to have a clear conscience.

20:08.599 --> 20:12.680
Tadeusz, stop it.
He was a good man.

20:13.880 --> 20:17.240
I know too well
what kind of man he was.

20:19.039 --> 20:21.200
You'd know
if you hadn't disowned him.

20:22.279 --> 20:23.559
He chose his fate on his own.

20:25.359 --> 20:27.400
And it's of course none of your fault.

20:36.119 --> 20:38.880
- Are you going with me ?
- You agree with him, don't you ?

20:40.599 --> 20:42.079
Come on, I'll give you a lift.

20:46.839 --> 20:47.880
No.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.160
Dad.

20:55.119 --> 20:56.200
Dad !

21:19.240 --> 21:20.200
Come in.

21:27.799 --> 21:30.480
That's all we needed:
a sex scandal with a dead man.

21:31.960 --> 21:35.119
No one's a saint but you're the one
who got caught with your dick out.

21:36.519 --> 21:40.079
In a fucking hotel !
Like a kid.

21:43.079 --> 21:46.039
It's good though
they didn't catch you with some boy.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.079
Is there anything else
I should know ?

21:53.680 --> 21:56.240
My attorney will file a lawsuit
against Kurier tomorrow.

21:57.160 --> 21:58.279
He won't.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.559
We'll try to hush it up.

22:02.960 --> 22:06.799
But if the media want to crucify you,
I'll be the first to hand them nails.

22:12.359 --> 22:13.759
How are the negotiations going ?

22:15.160 --> 22:16.200
Fine.

22:18.240 --> 22:20.839
On Saturday, I'm flying to Oslo
to finalise the details.

22:21.759 --> 22:24.480
This is the most important issue
for us right now, get it ?

22:26.000 --> 22:27.400
So don't fuck it up.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.599
And, Darek, from now on,
you show up only with your wife.

22:41.039 --> 22:43.480
You'd better
never meet her again.

23:03.359 --> 23:07.599
- Piotrek, you're late again.
- I know, I'm sorry.

23:08.079 --> 23:10.319
You still owe me a story
on the devastation of benches.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.000
I was going to do it now.

23:12.079 --> 23:14.279
No, now you have a conference
at the City Hall

23:14.359 --> 23:16.960
on the expansion of the controlled
parking zones.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.680
- Everything's fine.
- Come on, I'll give you a brief.

23:21.759 --> 23:22.720
In a second, hold on.

23:26.839 --> 23:27.799
Yes.

23:33.359 --> 23:34.519
What's going on ?

23:41.400 --> 23:42.359
Fancy a drink ?

23:48.920 --> 23:49.880
Go on, tell me.

23:52.079 --> 23:54.720
- I should quit.
- What bullshit is this ?

23:59.039 --> 24:01.319
Kowalik and those on the top
have their own ideas.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.319
But Kurier is you, not Kowalik.

24:04.680 --> 24:06.079
They need new blood.

24:08.559 --> 24:11.519
- People like her.
- Cut it out.

24:12.839 --> 24:14.839
She's just brought
in a huge scandal.

24:19.799 --> 24:21.920
You know Skalski got
his palm greased ?

24:23.319 --> 24:25.920
- Guess by whom.
- Bogusz.

24:29.480 --> 24:30.400
And Nawrot.

24:39.039 --> 24:42.759
- Did Monika talk to him ?
- Have no idea.

24:46.759 --> 24:47.880
Thanks, man.

24:55.279 --> 24:57.519
- Piotrek !
- Will be back soon, really soon.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.400
- What are you doing ?
- Coming with you.

25:07.480 --> 25:09.119
- Where ?
- To see Nawrot.

25:09.200 --> 25:13.480
- No way.
- Monika, you owe me something.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.960
Besides, it has nothing to do
with your story.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.680
How's work at the City News ?

25:29.759 --> 25:31.640
- Awesome.
- Is it ?

25:34.039 --> 25:37.359
Yes. I finally write about issue
that really matter to people.

25:38.000 --> 25:38.920
Like what ?

25:40.519 --> 25:44.920
Read my articles and you'll see.
It was a great decision.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.440
Interesting.
Rafał says you're skiving.

26:20.359 --> 26:23.400
- Please, come inside.
- Oh, my... Two reporters !

26:24.799 --> 26:25.920
Should I be scared ?

26:26.599 --> 26:27.960
- Hello.
- Hello.

26:29.960 --> 26:32.480
I have an important meeting soon.
Coffee, tea, water ?

26:32.559 --> 26:35.200
Since you're pressed for time,
please don't trouble yourself.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.119
All right, how can I help you ?

26:39.200 --> 26:41.799
Would you mind
if I recorded our conversation ?

26:42.319 --> 26:43.559
Please, go ahead.

26:44.799 --> 26:45.799
Pek-War.

26:47.720 --> 26:53.519
I'm afraid it's not the best time.
My partner is indisposed.

26:54.839 --> 26:56.359
That's why we're here.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.440
The truth is,
I have no idea how Pek-War works.

26:59.880 --> 27:04.519
I only provided capital.
It was one of my many investments.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.480
The person who did business
with the Chinese was Adrian.

27:08.200 --> 27:11.440
- And there is no one else ?
- Who else ?

27:11.759 --> 27:15.279
- A third partner ?
- No. Excuse me.

27:18.400 --> 27:22.920
Yes. Start negotiating
without me.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.960
Yes, I'll show up at the end.

27:31.720 --> 27:34.279
- I'm sorry but we have to finish.
- Running late ?

27:36.039 --> 27:37.559
Thanks for talking to us.

27:37.640 --> 27:40.240
It's a pity
I didn't satisfy your curiosity.

27:40.720 --> 27:41.880
On the contrary.

27:49.720 --> 27:52.880
Oh, one more thing.
Abraham.

27:56.200 --> 27:57.799
I'm afraid I don't understand.

28:00.359 --> 28:02.519
Abraham: does it mean
anything to you ?

28:02.599 --> 28:05.640
- Should it ?
- It was Bogusz's last word.

28:09.799 --> 28:11.359
How do you know ?

28:11.440 --> 28:13.440
What was the link
between him and my brother ?

28:15.960 --> 28:19.519
- I don't know. Should there be any ?
- You knew both of them.

28:20.319 --> 28:21.519
I know lots of people.

28:23.839 --> 28:26.200
I have no idea
of whatever you're implying.

28:26.279 --> 28:30.400
At the cemetery, after the funeral,
I felt you wanted to tell me something.

28:32.359 --> 28:33.480
Did you ?

28:37.039 --> 28:39.480
You're a good reporter.
You'll manage.

28:58.559 --> 29:00.480
- What was that ?
- None of your business.

29:00.559 --> 29:02.519
I let you come with me
to my interview.

29:02.599 --> 29:05.079
Interview ? You came here
with a preconception.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.160
You wanted to hear only the things
you might find useful.

31:02.160 --> 31:06.039
- Hi, Piotruś. Coffee ?
- What are you doing here ?

31:06.759 --> 31:10.920
Working, ain't we ? Someone turned
your flat into quite a mess.

31:11.599 --> 31:14.680
- Who called you here ?
- So, shall we go to the station ?

31:14.759 --> 31:18.359
- We'll write a report, OK ?
- You won't catch him anyway.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.920
- What do you know about that ?
- I don't read tabloids.

31:23.440 --> 31:25.519
Then why are you so interested
in this gentleman ?

31:25.599 --> 31:27.880
You want to know
something about it, ask them.

31:27.960 --> 31:30.559
- They say they got it from you.
- I don't reveal my sources.

31:30.640 --> 31:32.960
- Even when people die ?
- Especially then.

31:33.039 --> 31:35.799
Look, you're gonna help us,
we're gonna help you.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.759
You look like you need backup.

31:40.039 --> 31:42.440
I don't want to be rude
but I've got a flat to tidy up.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.119
So...

31:47.039 --> 31:48.039
As you wish.

32:03.400 --> 32:06.680
- Yes, Ewa, hello ?
- I know who painted the picture.

32:06.759 --> 32:09.960
His name is Dec. He has an atelier
on the Vistula Scarp.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.599
Excuse me, Piotr, I have to go.

32:15.839 --> 32:18.000
What's wrong ?
Why aren't you at Grandpa's ?

32:26.079 --> 32:30.839
I fucking knew it,
you were the reason they fell out.

32:38.480 --> 32:41.240
- It doesn't concern you.
- Sure, it doesn't.

32:43.160 --> 32:46.400
Like the fact that Dad
stabbed the old man with the bayonet,

32:46.480 --> 32:49.839
ordered that fucked-up painting
or that you fucked the two of them.

32:54.359 --> 32:55.359
Kuba !

33:33.759 --> 33:34.720
You're back.

33:36.279 --> 33:37.240
Go there, please.

33:54.519 --> 33:56.759
- You want to go out like this ?
- Why not ?

34:00.960 --> 34:02.599
Take it off. It needs ironing.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.440
Come with me,
we'd be there together.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.199
Will you let me take you out
some time ?

34:49.280 --> 34:50.199
Wait.

35:17.280 --> 35:19.159
A job like any other.

35:19.719 --> 35:22.360
He gave me your photo,
the money was good,

35:22.440 --> 35:25.599
the idea a little weird,
but I didn't ask any questions.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.639
He asked me not to change anything

35:30.039 --> 35:33.320
but look, the original screwed up
the light and shade.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.480
Original ?

35:35.400 --> 35:38.000
The painting is
at the Dominican Church in Kraków,

35:38.079 --> 35:40.199
17th century,
by an unknown artist.

35:40.280 --> 35:44.800
- And you changed only my face ?
- Your face, plus the light and shade.

35:45.880 --> 35:50.559
And he also asked
to add this date.

36:21.119 --> 36:22.719
All of our guests, welcome !

36:29.360 --> 36:33.320
Every year, our foundation
hands out an award

36:34.639 --> 36:39.000
to those who help to develop
the market while helping others.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.000
They are exceptional people,
we always emphasise this,

36:43.960 --> 36:48.280
but to call this year's winner of the
Good-Hearted Businessman Award

36:48.360 --> 36:50.239
an exceptional person
is not enough.

36:50.679 --> 36:54.079
Therefore, we'd like
to show you a short film,

36:54.159 --> 36:59.480
which presents the road our hero
had to take to be here with you.

37:01.840 --> 37:05.599
Żyrardów, this is where
our winner grew up,

37:08.639 --> 37:10.960
you recognise him ?

37:11.400 --> 37:14.960
A proud son of Mazovia was already
interested in his friends' money.

37:17.440 --> 37:22.480
Vinegar, queues, ration coupons, food
without taste for money without value.

37:23.719 --> 37:25.880
This is what our May picnics
looked like.

37:27.039 --> 37:29.960
In 1989, our hero was taking
his high school exams

37:31.159 --> 37:33.599
but it didn't stop him
from working after hours.

37:35.519 --> 37:38.639
As far as I know,
no inaccuracies were reported.

37:39.679 --> 37:42.199
Here, we officially enter
the big world,

37:44.920 --> 37:46.639
the first taste of freedom.

37:49.199 --> 37:52.199
The first company,
obviously with his own capital.

37:52.639 --> 37:55.800
At the beginning,
they assembled them on their own,

37:55.880 --> 37:58.960
a few years later, they became
the main importer of leading brands,

38:00.039 --> 38:01.840
but let's not put it off too long.

38:01.920 --> 38:03.960
The symbol of Polish
entrepreneurial spirit,

38:04.039 --> 38:05.559
the icon of our transformation.

38:05.639 --> 38:10.400
A philanthropist with a heart
of gold and a good friend of mine,

38:10.960 --> 38:12.559
Tomasz Nawrot.

38:29.679 --> 38:31.840
Thank you, dears.
Thank you with all my heart.

38:32.480 --> 38:34.119
It cost you a lot of work, Janusz.

38:34.199 --> 38:36.320
If I'd known
you were preparing such a surprise,

38:36.400 --> 38:38.360
I'd recommend you
a professional company.

38:43.199 --> 38:46.000
I just want to add one remark.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.000
Money won't make you happy.

38:51.559 --> 38:53.760
You're happy only
when you spend it.

39:00.119 --> 39:02.639
When you spend it
to help others.

39:20.360 --> 39:21.400
A hard day ?

39:26.000 --> 39:27.239
I've seen better ones.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.599
Are you the one
I should thank for the article ?

39:33.679 --> 39:36.320
No, the gossip column
is run by the colleague of mine.

39:38.840 --> 39:40.440
So you would have done
that differently.

39:42.159 --> 39:44.559
At least, I'd have chosen
a better photo of you, Minister.

39:48.599 --> 39:49.800
That hurts the most.

39:52.679 --> 39:56.000
The worst thing is that your colleagues
don't even know where to search.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.920
Minister, may I talk to you
for a moment ?

40:09.239 --> 40:12.199
- I won't talk to you.
- It's about Pek-War.

40:14.039 --> 40:14.960
Sorry ?

40:16.639 --> 40:19.159
I'd like to give you a chance
to comment on the entire issue

40:19.239 --> 40:21.119
before my article goes to press.

40:22.159 --> 40:24.039
It's about your being
their silent partner.

40:24.639 --> 40:27.320
- What are you talking about ?
- So you're denying that ?

40:28.760 --> 40:30.039
Goodbye. Excuse me.

40:44.119 --> 40:46.719
Nice film, the crowd loves you.

40:47.039 --> 40:50.679
Yes, I bet they prepared
the video for my funeral.

40:56.159 --> 40:57.679
Have you met
anyone interesting ?

40:59.320 --> 41:01.280
No, but thanks
for the invitation anyway.

41:02.480 --> 41:03.760
What invitation ?

41:08.159 --> 41:09.280
Mr Grodecki ?

41:32.559 --> 41:34.320
Can I see your invitation, please ?

41:36.039 --> 41:38.679
- And you are... ?
- The head of security.

41:48.920 --> 41:52.079
- Can I see your invitation, please ?
- Sorry ?

41:53.639 --> 41:55.400
You're not welcome here.

41:58.039 --> 42:01.480
Leave this place, get it ?

42:04.519 --> 42:05.519
Who sent you ?

42:10.159 --> 42:11.920
Don't fucking butt in.

42:54.320 --> 42:56.639
Hello, may I have
your attention, please ?

43:00.440 --> 43:02.679
I know, you're probably wondering
what I'm doing here

43:02.760 --> 43:04.000
and who invited me.

43:05.559 --> 43:06.880
I'd like to know it myself.

43:08.440 --> 43:11.000
All of you who gathered here
are people of success,

43:11.440 --> 43:12.920
all of you are wealthy.

43:14.360 --> 43:18.480
And it's a problem.
What to do with so much money ?

43:21.280 --> 43:23.360
What do you have
to sacrifice to get it ?

43:25.039 --> 43:29.280
How far can you go ?
Where's the boundary you can't cross ?

43:32.360 --> 43:37.239
Abraham...
God told him to sacrifice his son.

43:38.360 --> 43:39.800
That is a lot, right ?

43:40.199 --> 43:43.360
But that deal,
did it bring Abraham any profits ?

43:45.519 --> 43:47.400
It did, it brought him
substantial profits.

43:49.239 --> 43:53.599
For his blind obedience, God promised
to make him the king of the vast land.

43:53.679 --> 43:56.800
What promise was made to you ?
I'm asking you...

44:01.079 --> 44:04.159
- Please, come with me, sir.
- What have I done ?

44:05.400 --> 44:08.559
All right, I'll go on my own.
Stop pushing me, will you ?

44:08.639 --> 44:10.239
- Here you are.
- Thank you very much.

44:15.320 --> 44:16.239
Hello.

44:19.239 --> 44:20.239
Who's that ?

44:23.679 --> 44:24.679
Are you here ?

44:28.239 --> 44:30.320
What ? What conspiracy ?

44:32.599 --> 44:33.840
Tell me the fucking truth

44:33.920 --> 44:35.800
or I'll go back to the stage
and say all the rest.

44:36.199 --> 44:40.639
Konary ? What happened there
twenty-five years ago ?

45:26.239 --> 45:27.679
What are you doing here ?

45:27.760 --> 45:29.599
One guy ran out
of the building a minute ago.

45:29.679 --> 45:31.800
- Get out of here, man !
- It's really important.

45:32.360 --> 45:33.840
You can help me.

47:57.199 --> 47:58.960
PAKT
Episode 3
