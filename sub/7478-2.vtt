WEBVTT

00:30.071 --> 00:32.644
Yo, Don Ho. How about a refill?

00:49.257 --> 00:51.272
- It looks good.
- Hey.

00:51.296 --> 00:54.634
- Give him the money.
- I told you my cocaine's pure.

01:10.111 --> 01:12.104
I think we got company.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.201
Go, go.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.043
Bang. You're dead.

02:33.067 --> 02:35.288
You have to clear yourself
of the line of fire.

02:35.312 --> 02:37.896
Do it again. Focus, Dom.

02:41.703 --> 02:44.845
Bang! You can't move until you know
where the weapon is.

02:44.869 --> 02:46.130
What if I step backwards?

02:46.154 --> 02:47.589
Wait until you feel the barrel.

02:47.613 --> 02:49.619
Again, hands up.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.413
Come on, come on. Hands up.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.138
- What are you doing?
- Training.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.830
To go undercover as a scarecrow?

03:12.854 --> 03:15.398
Sam is helping me hone
my agent skills.

03:19.991 --> 03:23.834
Personally, I do not respond
to being whistled at like a sheepdog.

03:23.858 --> 03:26.254
But Eric seems to have trained
the others.

03:26.278 --> 03:30.405
So I suggest you learn
the appropriate Pavlovian response.

03:32.670 --> 03:36.798
Which is "go, little doggie. Go."

03:42.221 --> 03:43.253
- Bang.
- Very funny.

03:44.223 --> 03:45.338
Roll them, Eric.

03:46.934 --> 03:49.722
Director Vance received this footage
from the L.A.P.D. This morning.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.906
It's the house-security-cam feed

03:51.930 --> 03:54.620
from the scene of a double homicide
in Malibu two days ago.

03:54.644 --> 03:57.664
Three masked guys invaded the home
of a suspected drug dealer,

03:57.688 --> 04:00.080
killed two people and stole
a large sum of money.

04:00.104 --> 04:02.748
What is the world coming to
when drug dealers aren't even safe

04:02.772 --> 04:05.868
in the comfort
of their own fortified homes? Heh.

04:06.496 --> 04:11.893
Oh. Your professional psychological
analysis

04:11.917 --> 04:15.180
is an invaluable asset
to our team, Nate.

04:15.204 --> 04:18.831
- Thanks, Hetty.
- But your standup needs some work.

04:19.926 --> 04:23.982
Save it for open-mike night. Mm?

04:24.006 --> 04:25.567
- Ouch.
- Shh.

04:25.591 --> 04:27.425
Carry on, people.

04:28.976 --> 04:31.704
So, what does this have to do
with NCIS?

04:31.728 --> 04:34.280
The suspects came in
and left from the ocean.

04:34.304 --> 04:37.494
And they were using
military hand signals.

04:37.518 --> 04:39.104
Throw it over, Eric.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.403
- What are you chasing, Sam?
- They're SEALs.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.373
How can you be so sure of that?

04:45.397 --> 04:47.592
- I know that guy.
- Through what?

04:47.616 --> 04:49.008
Body language? Hand signals?

04:49.032 --> 04:52.206
Hand signals are like handwriting,
dancing. Everybody's got their style.

04:52.542 --> 04:53.573
That's Kurt Holgate.

04:54.168 --> 04:55.971
Eric, punch him up.

04:55.995 --> 04:58.139
All right, let's see what we have here.

04:58.163 --> 04:59.917
Uh, "Kurt Holgate."

05:02.718 --> 05:04.521
Oh, impressive record.

05:04.545 --> 05:06.570
Holgate and his team
returned from overseas.

05:06.594 --> 05:08.400
They've been stateside
less than a month.

05:08.424 --> 05:11.327
- Huh. They're no longer active service.
- I'll look up Holgate's team.

05:11.351 --> 05:13.488
There's nothing in his history
that would suggest

05:13.512 --> 05:16.618
he's the kind of guy to get involved
in robbing a drug dealer.

05:16.642 --> 05:18.974
You're right.
He's not that kind of guy.

05:19.277 --> 05:22.088
- You sure you know this guy, Sam?
- Trust me.

05:22.112 --> 05:24.544
That's Holgate. I should know.
I taught him.

05:24.568 --> 05:27.504
"Another member of Holgate's
SEAL team, David Ramirez,

05:27.528 --> 05:31.722
was shot and killed three weeks ago
while walking out of a grocery store.

05:31.746 --> 05:33.717
Police report says
it was collateral damage

05:33.741 --> 05:36.218
from what's believed to have been
gang-related activity."

05:36.242 --> 05:38.055
No. That could be
a complete coincidence.

05:38.079 --> 05:40.388
It could be
a naval cluster bomb, Kensi.

05:40.412 --> 05:41.894
We've gotta proceed cautiously.

05:41.918 --> 05:45.317
Holgate is assigned to a task
force over at the Federal Building.

05:45.341 --> 05:48.216
I think maybe it's time
we pay your old friend a visit.

05:51.392 --> 05:52.993
When was the last time
you saw this guy?

05:53.017 --> 05:54.810
Bosnia.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.015
What, you have history with him?

05:57.607 --> 05:59.741
We weren't dating,
if that's what you're asking.

05:59.765 --> 06:01.578
SEALs work together as a team.

06:01.602 --> 06:03.663
Holgate had a tendency
to act like a lone wolf,

06:03.687 --> 06:05.298
if you know what I'm talking about.

06:05.322 --> 06:08.003
Actually, half the time
I don't know what you're talking about

06:08.027 --> 06:10.027
and the rest of the time
I just disagree.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.544
I really look forward to having Dom
as a partner.

06:13.568 --> 06:15.218
You'd miss me.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.531
I complete you.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.729
Hey, Holgate.

06:22.753 --> 06:25.130
Sam Hanna. How the hell are you?

06:25.676 --> 06:28.606
I'm well. It's been a while.
What are you doing here?

06:28.630 --> 06:30.572
Working. Joint-task-force stuff.

06:30.596 --> 06:33.113
Heard you got out a while back.
How's retirement?

06:33.137 --> 06:36.072
It's still a few years off.
I'm with NCIS now.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.599
Why? You lose a bet? Ha-ha-ha.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.281
I'm just kidding.

06:41.305 --> 06:43.002
How is that working out for you?

06:43.026 --> 06:45.922
- It's real good.
- Mm.

06:45.946 --> 06:48.877
- Sorry to hear about Ramirez.
- Yeah, thanks.

06:48.901 --> 06:50.617
God's got a cruel sense of humour.

06:52.954 --> 06:55.421
I gotta run. We should get together
over some beers sometime.

06:55.445 --> 06:56.974
- Sounds like a plan.
- All right.

06:56.998 --> 06:58.625
All right.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.395
He didn't ask you
what you were doing here.

07:04.419 --> 07:06.417
No, he didn't.

07:07.260 --> 07:11.340
Okay. Here's the video
of Sam's SEAL friend, Holgate.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.546
Whoa, freeze. Back it up.

07:16.811 --> 07:17.818
What do you think, Nate?

07:17.842 --> 07:21.116
He's trying hard to appear relaxed
and friendly,

07:21.140 --> 07:23.118
but doesn't offer
to shake your hand.

07:23.142 --> 07:26.164
And the moment you say "NCIS,"
he deflects with humour.

07:26.188 --> 07:27.501
Nothing in his records

07:27.525 --> 07:30.876
- to suggest any change in lifestyle.
- I can get in touch with the coroner,

07:30.900 --> 07:33.209
see if there's anything pertaining
to the crime scene

07:33.233 --> 07:35.320
that confirms SEAL involvement.

07:37.540 --> 07:40.719
What? You know, like ballistics?

07:40.743 --> 07:41.997
Really?

07:42.753 --> 07:45.244
You're throwing that out there
with a straight face?

07:45.506 --> 07:47.060
Since you profiled
that Dickenson case,

07:47.084 --> 07:48.918
you've had a thing for the coroner.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.876
Come... I don't know
what you're talking about.

07:53.347 --> 07:55.945
I mean she's hot,
but she works on dead bodies all day.

07:55.969 --> 07:57.660
It takes a certain kind of person.

07:57.684 --> 08:00.698
Nate seems lively compared to the stiff
she's normally working on.

08:00.722 --> 08:02.995
Your herd behaviour
is unbecoming, gentlemen.

08:03.019 --> 08:04.993
Guys, guys.

08:05.017 --> 08:06.200
Timothy Jackson.

08:06.224 --> 08:07.658
What about him?

08:07.682 --> 08:10.080
He's another member
of Holgate and Ramirez's SEAL team.

08:10.104 --> 08:12.000
In fact,
he was Ramirez's swim buddy.

08:12.024 --> 08:14.109
He's missing. Since the 18th.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.113
That's the same night
as the shooting.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.478
- That's Jackson's trailer there.
- Thank you.

08:27.502 --> 08:30.057
I haven't
seen him around lately, though.

08:30.081 --> 08:33.188
If Jackson is Ramirez's swim
buddy, they're closer than brothers.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.023
Your swim buddy
gets you through training,

08:35.047 --> 08:36.479
helps you survive hell week.

08:36.503 --> 08:38.509
I could use a swim buddy
to deal with Hetty.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.434
Jackson has got a sweet trailer.

08:44.023 --> 08:45.197
Let's take a look around,

08:45.221 --> 08:48.685
see if he's coming home
any time soon.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.866
Too slow, Secret Squirrel.

09:09.006 --> 09:10.584
Not a lot of places to hide anything.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.389
Hail, hail, the gang is all here.

09:17.807 --> 09:20.345
You recognise these guys?

09:20.726 --> 09:23.988
We're in Jackson's trailer.
That's my friend Holgate.

09:24.012 --> 09:27.248
That's Ramirez who died
in the grocery store.

09:27.272 --> 09:29.979
- So who's the fourth?
- I don't know.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.340
You're a SEAL.

09:34.364 --> 09:36.608
Where would you hide
stolen drug money?

09:41.038 --> 09:42.592
Underwater?

09:42.616 --> 09:44.972
No. Because I wouldn't steal
anybody's money,

09:44.996 --> 09:47.493
drug dealer or otherwise.
I doubt these guys would either.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.601
You're the one who ID'd Holgate
from the surveillance footage.

09:51.625 --> 09:55.334
You don't like these guys being dirty,
but you wanna hear my theory?

09:58.097 --> 10:01.406
These guys are stuck overseas
in some hellhole for months on end,

10:01.430 --> 10:04.032
fighting for their lives,
watching their buddies get killed.

10:04.056 --> 10:05.770
For what?

10:06.063 --> 10:09.598
To save some people who would just
as soon slit their throats?

10:10.025 --> 10:13.002
And if they do finally make it back,
they come back,

10:13.026 --> 10:15.128
realise the local drug dealer
is wearing a watch

10:15.152 --> 10:16.958
that's worth more than their house.

10:16.982 --> 10:19.506
So they use a little bit
of what they know

10:19.530 --> 10:22.798
to take a little something back
for their retirement.

10:22.822 --> 10:25.049
I can see you're really intrigued
by this.

10:25.073 --> 10:26.624
SEALs don't do it for the money.

10:27.835 --> 10:28.866
For the chicks?

10:29.837 --> 10:32.055
It's probably more like a calling.
Like a seminary.

10:32.079 --> 10:33.263
That's right.

10:33.287 --> 10:36.229
If priests actually blew things up
and could kill you with a Bible.

10:36.253 --> 10:39.108
- You trying to get under my skin?
- Just bouncing ideas off you.

10:39.132 --> 10:41.653
Keep it up.
I'm gonna bounce you off a rock.

10:41.677 --> 10:43.177
I'll tell Nate you said that.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.088
All right, Eric. Thanks.

10:56.112 --> 10:59.067
Yeah, let me know if you find
anything else. All right, bye.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.505
GPS tracker is activated.

11:03.529 --> 11:04.843
Good.

11:04.867 --> 11:07.802
Eric confirmed Holgate is working
alongside Homeland Security

11:07.826 --> 11:09.719
on a human-trafficking task force.

11:09.743 --> 11:11.519
What if Holgate is not involved?

11:11.543 --> 11:13.597
Well, for his sake, I hope he's not.

11:13.621 --> 11:16.086
I wouldn't wanna wind up
on Sam's bad side.

11:16.926 --> 11:18.088
I think I already am.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.102
What do you mean?

11:20.126 --> 11:23.198
Just seems like nothing I do
is ever good enough for him.

11:23.222 --> 11:25.074
Sam demands the best from himself.

11:25.098 --> 11:28.197
It's hard for him to accept
anything less from anybody else.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.830
You'll get used to it.

11:29.854 --> 11:31.955
It's just...
It's hard being the new guy.

11:31.979 --> 11:33.703
Try being the new girl.

11:33.727 --> 11:36.794
They used to make me crawl
into air vents, under houses

11:36.818 --> 11:38.530
just because
I was the "smallest one."

11:39.115 --> 11:41.582
And when was the last time any of you
had to put on a bikini

11:41.606 --> 11:43.005
for an assignment?

11:43.029 --> 11:45.634
Yeah, that's right.
Try hiding a gun in your thong.

11:45.658 --> 11:47.372
All right. Ha, ha.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.616
I just never thought of it that way.

11:50.126 --> 11:53.056
Yeah. Well,
it's obviously not like that anymore.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.187
If you can prove
that you can protect yourself

11:55.211 --> 11:57.041
and protect your team, they'll let up.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.442
If Sam is hard on you in the office,

11:59.466 --> 12:02.553
it's really just because he wants
to protect you in the field.

12:03.848 --> 12:07.347
Well, of course, either that
or he genuinely doesn't like you.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.093
Oh, oh, oh, heads up.

12:11.605 --> 12:13.313
Holgate is on the move.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.684
No, look, Kensi. He's not.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.397
Looks like we got a meeting, Dom.

12:21.866 --> 12:25.092
Can't see anything. Gonna risk getting
closer to hear what they're saying.

12:25.116 --> 12:26.696
Give me the ears.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.604
She'll be
fine. Don't jump to any conclusions.

12:40.628 --> 12:41.832
Could be a coincidence.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.487
You willing to take that chance?

12:43.511 --> 12:45.612
- What do you wanna do?
- Lay low, off the grid.

12:45.636 --> 12:47.407
Keep your head on a swivel.

12:47.431 --> 12:49.901
They could already be watching us.

12:49.925 --> 12:51.109
He's watching you.

12:51.133 --> 12:54.075
Watching like he's paranoid
or watching like he's checking me out?

12:54.099 --> 12:55.328
What's the difference?

12:55.352 --> 12:57.292
Usually the time focused on my butt.

12:57.316 --> 12:59.085
He's paranoid. No offence.

12:59.109 --> 13:00.417
Where are you?

13:00.441 --> 13:02.628
At home? Well, that's funny.

13:02.652 --> 13:05.255
I'm looking right at your car,
you lying son of a bitch.

13:05.279 --> 13:06.458
Who is she?

13:06.482 --> 13:09.365
Because I would like to carve
the bitch's name in your paint job.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.968
And don't call me.

13:12.992 --> 13:15.919
I'll contact you when we're cool.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.097
Uh, Dom?

13:29.975 --> 13:31.908
Have Eric run these plates.

13:31.932 --> 13:34.142
I think I just bought the owner
some bodywork.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.269
Great.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.850
I've got it. Thanks.

13:41.278 --> 13:44.232
The fourth man in the photo
is named Morris Raspen.

13:44.907 --> 13:48.442
If he was part of the team,
I'm sure Ramirez's widow knows him.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.176
- Mrs. Ramirez?
- Yes.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.262
I'm Sam Hanna, this is my partner,
Callen.

13:58.286 --> 13:59.897
We'd like to ask you some questions

13:59.921 --> 14:02.295
about your husband
and his teammates.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.253
You're a SEAL, aren't you?

14:05.719 --> 14:06.964
Yes, ma'am.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.654
I never asked him about his job.

14:11.678 --> 14:13.570
I knew it was dangerous.

14:13.594 --> 14:18.561
He'd always say, "Don't worry, baby.
You ain't getting rid of me that easy."

14:19.692 --> 14:24.354
I never expected to lose him
just running to the grocery store.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.358
So he didn't know the men
who shot him?

14:31.453 --> 14:33.695
No. They were drug dealers.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.037
Are you still in touch
with the other members of his team?

14:37.501 --> 14:39.328
SEALs take care of their own.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.647
The wives are pretty close too.

14:41.671 --> 14:43.878
Those who have wives.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.234
When was the last time
you saw Timothy Jackson?

14:47.258 --> 14:50.855
He usually comes by here
Friday, but he never showed up.

14:50.879 --> 14:53.784
He stops by to check on me
and my son.

14:53.808 --> 14:56.015
Tim and David went through BUDS
together.

14:56.562 --> 15:00.238
I think, sometimes, he was closer
to my husband than I was.

15:00.262 --> 15:02.374
Do you have any idea where he is?

15:02.398 --> 15:03.398
No.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.770
When was the last time you saw
Morris Raspen?

15:07.489 --> 15:08.580
At the funeral.

15:08.604 --> 15:10.466
He was the newest member
of the team.

15:10.490 --> 15:11.774
I don't really know him.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.720
Excuse me. Yeah?

15:16.744 --> 15:19.299
I've been combing through financial,
e-mail, phone records,

15:19.323 --> 15:20.722
everything on Timothy Jackson.

15:20.746 --> 15:22.853
- Nothing stands out.
- I didn't think it would.

15:22.877 --> 15:25.977
But I can tell you where he was
the day of the shootings.

15:26.001 --> 15:28.986
His credit card was used at a place
called The Sunset in Malibu.

15:29.010 --> 15:31.027
All right. Thanks.

15:31.051 --> 15:34.151
So I open this guy up
to do an autopsy

15:34.175 --> 15:36.864
and there is this miniature
cuckoo clock

15:36.888 --> 15:39.195
where his heart should be,
still ticking.

15:39.219 --> 15:41.412
And as I pull it out, it goes off.

15:41.436 --> 15:46.494
But instead of a bird popping out,
it's this little garden gnome.

15:46.518 --> 15:51.108
He jumps out of the clock, flips me off,
and then runs out the door.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.593
Oh, um... Ahem.

15:53.617 --> 15:55.968
I'm more
of an operational psychologist,

15:55.992 --> 15:59.698
so I don't really do dream analysis.

16:00.959 --> 16:01.967
Oh, okay.

16:01.991 --> 16:04.387
But if I were to hazard a guess,

16:04.411 --> 16:09.962
I'd say that the clock
obviously represents time.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.882
And the autopsy, death.

16:15.391 --> 16:19.411
And yet there is this magical creature
that lives on inside of him

16:19.435 --> 16:22.035
that is set free by your actions.

16:22.059 --> 16:24.164
So I helped release his soul?

16:24.188 --> 16:29.518
- Uh, yeah.
- Okay. Then why did he flip me off?

16:30.197 --> 16:32.403
Gnomes. Notoriously cranky.

16:34.952 --> 16:35.959
Okay.

16:35.983 --> 16:39.802
So no one has come
to claim our friend, the drug dealer.

16:39.826 --> 16:41.599
Ballistics were inconclusive.

16:41.623 --> 16:44.200
No way to tell
if SEALs were responsible.

16:45.462 --> 16:49.518
Two 9-millimetre slugs to the chest
from about 15 feet.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.208
Turned his heart into hamburger.

16:52.511 --> 16:55.488
The shooter double-tapped him
just left of centre,

16:55.512 --> 16:57.649
knew the anatomy of a kill shot.

16:57.673 --> 16:59.699
That is a professional.

16:59.723 --> 17:02.621
So the same gun was used
to kill both drug dealers?

17:02.645 --> 17:04.946
There was only one drug dealer.

17:04.971 --> 17:07.141
- There were two victims.
- You mean the cop?

17:08.068 --> 17:11.294
We were told that two suspected
drug dealers were killed.

17:11.318 --> 17:14.442
Yeah. The other victim
was an L.A.P.D. Officer.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.678
Bullet fragmented too much
to make a match.

17:17.702 --> 17:19.470
Why wasn't that in the report?

17:19.493 --> 17:24.290
Well, the guy was so deep undercover
that we didn't get the info until today.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.971
Those guys are cowboys. Ha, ha.

17:27.994 --> 17:29.714
I know the type.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.382
Why are we just hearing
about this now, Nate?

17:39.767 --> 17:42.055
Yeah. Okay.

17:42.394 --> 17:43.533
Thanks.

17:43.557 --> 17:46.326
- Problem?
- Uh, you could say that.

17:46.350 --> 17:49.690
One of the guys killed in the shootout
was an undercover cop.

17:51.737 --> 17:53.789
This just keeps
getting better and better.

17:53.813 --> 17:56.527
That's our missing SEAL's
motorcycle.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.763
How are you doing?

18:00.787 --> 18:03.468
Sorry, guys.
We don't open for another 20 minutes.

18:03.492 --> 18:07.010
I was just hoping to talk to somebody
that was here a couple days ago.

18:07.034 --> 18:10.223
- You're looking at her.
- Let me ask you something.

18:10.247 --> 18:12.296
Do you recognise
any of these guys?

18:14.301 --> 18:16.258
Yeah. Three of those guys were here.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.981
Pretty cute. Good tippers.

18:19.005 --> 18:21.066
You didn't hear
what they were talking about?

18:21.090 --> 18:22.986
No. It was pretty busy.

18:23.010 --> 18:25.200
I do know they got into an argument
at one point.

18:25.224 --> 18:26.451
About what?

18:26.475 --> 18:28.781
Like I said, it was really busy.
They took it outside.

18:28.805 --> 18:30.239
So you saw them leave?

18:30.263 --> 18:32.565
No. Sorry.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.587
How long has that motorcycle
been there?

18:34.611 --> 18:36.416
I don't know. Couple days, maybe.

18:36.440 --> 18:39.426
Never thought about it. I figured
it belonged to a local or something.

18:39.450 --> 18:41.492
Do you have surveillance cameras
inside?

18:43.539 --> 18:45.258
Well, the house
where the shooting occurred

18:45.282 --> 18:47.058
is just a couple miles down the road.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.887
Just a short drive.

18:48.911 --> 18:51.125
Or a short swim.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.224
Why would somebody swim?

18:53.248 --> 18:54.586
Because they could.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.297
What do you got, Eric?

19:03.517 --> 19:06.437
Call the sheriff's department back.
Tell them to put us on the guest list.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.936
- Thanks.
- Good news or bad news?

19:10.315 --> 19:12.083
A body just washed up
at Point Dume

19:12.107 --> 19:14.648
that matches the description
of Timothy Jackson.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.381
Lifeguard pulled him in,
tried to revive him,

19:27.405 --> 19:31.082
but looks like he's been dead
a couple days.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.948
It's Jackson.

19:42.972 --> 19:45.975
Looks like a single gunshot wound
to the side.

19:58.113 --> 20:00.604
Surf has been pretty big lately.

20:02.367 --> 20:04.490
Stronger currents.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.951
It could have taken him out for miles.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.835
Yeah.

20:19.176 --> 20:22.355
This is from the Sunset
Restaurant in Malibu on Saturday.

20:22.379 --> 20:26.398
Holgate and Raspen take Jackson out
for some fresh air around 2:11.

20:26.422 --> 20:28.118
How do you know
they're not leaving?

20:28.142 --> 20:30.325
They didn't close out the tab.

20:30.349 --> 20:33.332
SEALs wouldn't leave an unfinished
bill if the place was on fire.

20:33.356 --> 20:35.018
Eric.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.247
All right, jumping ahead.

20:38.271 --> 20:39.619
Here we go.

20:39.643 --> 20:43.131
Holgate and Raspen return
without Jackson at 6:39.

20:43.155 --> 20:45.757
- So Jackson left?
- If he did, without his motorcycle.

20:45.781 --> 20:48.135
It hasn't moved from the parking lot
since that day.

20:48.159 --> 20:51.011
Kensi and Dom observed Holgate
talking to someone this afternoon

20:51.035 --> 20:52.488
who we now know is Raspen.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.760
That's Raspen meeting Holgate.

20:55.784 --> 20:57.682
Holgate told him to lay low.

20:57.706 --> 21:01.107
Jackson, Holgate and Raspen rip off
a known drug dealer

21:01.131 --> 21:05.109
as payback for Ramirez's death,
but Jackson is shot in the process

21:05.133 --> 21:07.772
- and drowns during the escape.
- And the money?

21:07.796 --> 21:10.276
- Maybe it goes to Ramirez's widow.
- No sign of that.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.659
We're gonna keep looking.
Raspen is the best way in.

21:12.683 --> 21:14.728
He was the newest member
of the team.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.117
Yeah. Well, Raspen seems
to have gone underground.

21:17.141 --> 21:19.037
SEALs are your people, Sam.

21:19.061 --> 21:21.359
- You have anything you'd like to add?
- No.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.947
Look, being a SEAL is a big part
of who Sam is.

21:29.329 --> 21:33.137
If these guys are dirty,
they threaten his very identity.

21:33.161 --> 21:35.136
They will protect each other
at all cost.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.909
Nate, you don't have to worry
about Sam.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.722
This is a joyous occasion.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.494
Now, I'm assuming
all our cases are closed.

21:59.518 --> 22:03.287
Otherwise, how could you be here
working out in the middle of the day?

22:03.311 --> 22:05.777
- I'm just waiting for Callen.
- Mm-hm.

22:07.075 --> 22:08.843
What's wrong, Sam?

22:08.867 --> 22:11.799
Why does something have to be
wrong? Can't a guy exercise?

22:11.823 --> 22:13.551
Pilates is exercise.

22:13.575 --> 22:15.598
Beating the hell out of something

22:15.622 --> 22:18.746
is an aggressive expression
of male frustration.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.290
This is about your SEAL brethren.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.151
Have they disgraced the uniform?

22:26.175 --> 22:30.045
When does duty trump loyalty? Hm?

22:30.766 --> 22:34.490
Nobility, honour, betrayal.

22:34.514 --> 22:37.663
All you need
is a backstabbing whore

22:37.687 --> 22:42.185
and you've got the makings
of a Elizabethan tragedy.

22:42.778 --> 22:48.175
- Don't mock me.
- I criticise, I scold, I chastise.

22:48.199 --> 22:50.584
I've even torn someone a new one.

22:50.608 --> 22:53.087
But I never mock.

22:53.111 --> 22:56.799
You, Sam Hanna,
are more than this job

22:56.823 --> 22:59.372
and much more than a SEAL.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.606
What if Holgate
doesn't lead us to the money?

23:11.630 --> 23:13.656
- We go to plan B.
- What's plan B?

23:13.680 --> 23:15.808
We don't have one yet.

23:20.524 --> 23:21.875
What are you doing?

23:21.899 --> 23:24.748
I, my friend, have to pee.

23:24.772 --> 23:26.249
Whoa, whoa, in here?

23:26.273 --> 23:29.874
Yeah, well... Oops, sorry.
My bladder is gonna burst if I don't.

23:29.898 --> 23:33.254
Can't you just go into a coffee shop
or, like, restaurant or someplace?

23:33.278 --> 23:35.054
Dom, we are on a stakeout.

23:35.078 --> 23:37.548
Welcome to the glamorous world
of surveillance.

23:37.572 --> 23:40.454
- I'll just go for a walk. A quick walk.
- Sit your butt down.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.974
Oh, man. Damn it.
Holgate is out now, see?

23:44.998 --> 23:47.557
And I can't pee now.
Are you satisfied?

23:47.581 --> 23:51.567
You know what? If I pee in my pants,
you are so paying for the dry cleaning.

23:51.591 --> 23:52.878
Oh, God.

24:02.357 --> 24:03.816
I'm bringing up his tracker now.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.417
He's accelerating.

24:08.441 --> 24:09.728
Well, stick with him.

24:21.209 --> 24:23.308
Taking evasive action.
He must know we're following.

24:23.332 --> 24:25.638
No, wait. He's driving in a big circle.

24:25.662 --> 24:29.338
He's making a cleaning run,
he's making sure he's not being tailed.

24:43.940 --> 24:46.075
- He stopped moving.
- Stop the car. Stop the car.

24:46.099 --> 24:47.995
- I can catch him.
- This is what he wants,

24:48.019 --> 24:50.686
for us to show ourselves.
Just pull over.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.731
There must be a traffic cam nearby.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.510
He's not in his car.

25:00.534 --> 25:03.578
- Can you get a location from his cell?
- Yeah, I'm trying.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.351
Hey, Callen. It's Kensi.
Holgate ditched his car.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.895
We're gonna try and track him
on his cell phone.

25:09.919 --> 25:12.226
Tell Eric to shut off his phone.
If Holgate knows,

25:12.250 --> 25:15.464
he's going to warn Raspen.
We're just about to pay him a visit.

25:18.558 --> 25:20.527
Holgate is in the wind.

25:20.551 --> 25:21.818
Yeah, okay.

25:21.842 --> 25:23.099
Where do you want to meet?

25:24.189 --> 25:25.220
Raspen.

26:13.947 --> 26:14.978
Drop the gun.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.544
I'm an NCIS agent.

26:17.568 --> 26:19.367
I'd do as he says.

26:36.043 --> 26:37.486
Recognise your SEAL buddy
Jackson?

26:41.449 --> 26:44.070
Yeah. He probably looked a little rosier
last time you saw him.

26:48.873 --> 26:50.972
We've got you and Holgate
arguing with Jackson,

26:50.996 --> 26:52.970
leaving the bar together,

26:52.994 --> 26:54.556
and then coming back without him.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.224
I think he hooked up with a girl.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.687
Yeah. There's no footage of that.

26:58.711 --> 27:01.315
And his motorcycle never left
the restaurant.

27:01.339 --> 27:02.709
Maybe he went home with her.

27:03.012 --> 27:04.019
He's lying.

27:04.043 --> 27:07.946
Actually, he's trying very hard not to lie
by avoiding definitive sentences.

27:07.970 --> 27:11.368
Uh, "I think he... Maybe he..."

27:11.392 --> 27:13.436
Lies of omission are still lies.

27:14.357 --> 27:16.349
You three didn't rip off
a drug dealer?

27:18.319 --> 27:19.706
Seriously?

27:19.730 --> 27:20.911
That's what you think?

27:20.935 --> 27:23.545
How about you and I
tell each other something

27:23.569 --> 27:24.856
that we don't know?

27:26.536 --> 27:28.327
Okay, I'll begin.

27:29.080 --> 27:33.742
One of the drug dealers that you killed
was an undercover cop.

27:37.839 --> 27:39.333
Yeah.

27:40.758 --> 27:42.608
- Where are you going?
- To expedite this process.

27:42.632 --> 27:44.106
Sam, stop. Don't go in there.

27:44.130 --> 27:46.106
- Give Callen a chance.
- We're wasting time.

27:46.130 --> 27:49.116
I know you're angry and take
their actions personally, but you can't...

27:49.140 --> 27:52.867
Doc, do me a favour
and stay out of my head.

27:52.891 --> 27:55.494
Okay. Let's just take a step back
and think about this.

27:55.518 --> 27:56.911
SEALs have a word for that.

27:56.935 --> 27:59.871
It's called retreating.
It's something we don't do.

27:59.895 --> 28:02.880
Now if he doesn't get anything
from that guy by the time I get back,

28:02.904 --> 28:05.563
I'm gonna jog his memory
from the inside out.

28:18.588 --> 28:23.131
Is it too much to ask
for a little peace and quiet?

28:23.426 --> 28:26.984
It's Bach, for Pete's sake.

28:27.008 --> 28:28.354
Bach.

28:28.378 --> 28:30.655
Can't you hear that?

28:30.679 --> 28:35.654
What do I have to do to get through
that impenetrable cranium of yours?

28:35.678 --> 28:36.969
Sam, I...

28:38.608 --> 28:41.277
Oh, for the love of Gucci.

28:43.112 --> 28:46.291
What is the matter with you men?

28:46.315 --> 28:48.792
Sorry,
I was just letting off a little steam.

28:48.816 --> 28:52.670
Like the little engine that could?
I know, you lost a target.

28:52.694 --> 28:56.288
Big deal. It happens. Get over it.

28:57.126 --> 28:59.510
- So you heard about that.
- Of course I heard about it.

28:59.534 --> 29:02.333
I know what you ate for breakfast,
sweetie.

29:05.176 --> 29:10.597
You think Callen and Sam
never screwed up.

29:12.516 --> 29:17.949
Okay. Once Callen fell
through a skylight installing a camera

29:17.973 --> 29:21.563
and landed in bed with the target.

29:22.151 --> 29:24.036
And ask Sam about the time

29:24.060 --> 29:27.819
he backed over
a suspect's beagle puppy.

29:28.449 --> 29:31.699
And don't you think
they walked in here holding hands.

29:32.328 --> 29:35.673
Once I had to turn
a fire extinguisher on them.

29:35.697 --> 29:37.557
- Really?
- No.

29:37.581 --> 29:40.299
These are just charming anecdotes
I made up

29:40.323 --> 29:42.246
to bolster your self-esteem.

29:45.675 --> 29:50.194
Oh. Oh, and listen, pivot on
your back foot when you punch.

29:50.218 --> 29:52.546
Otherwise,
you're losing all your power.

30:28.759 --> 30:30.609
- Drop the gun.
- You drop the gun.

30:30.633 --> 30:32.238
- I'm an NCIS agent.
- Yeah?

30:32.262 --> 30:34.090
Well, I'm L.A.P.D.

30:35.474 --> 30:37.432
And this is my crime scene.

30:44.442 --> 30:46.457
I knew the Navy was behind this.

30:46.481 --> 30:49.831
- Not in any official capacity.
- Official, unofficial.

30:49.855 --> 30:53.234
Either way, the dead guy washed up
on the beach was one of yours.

30:54.118 --> 30:58.555
My partner died here in my arms.

30:58.579 --> 31:01.286
- Shot by one of your men.
- They're not my men.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.059
Then why are you here?

31:05.083 --> 31:07.686
Surveillance video doesn't tell
the whole story.

31:07.710 --> 31:10.563
I wanted to walk through it
for myself.

31:10.587 --> 31:11.922
What's your excuse?

31:12.345 --> 31:13.566
I was hoping to find something

31:13.590 --> 31:16.194
that might lead me
to my partner's killers.

31:16.218 --> 31:17.932
Looks like I did.

31:19.185 --> 31:21.449
I want names and addresses.

31:21.473 --> 31:23.614
Full Navy cooperation.

31:23.638 --> 31:25.866
Unless you want the news media
all over a story

31:25.890 --> 31:28.284
about rogue SEALs
going off the reservation

31:28.308 --> 31:30.146
and killing a cop.

31:32.239 --> 31:34.173
Yeah. Yeah, he's right here.

31:34.197 --> 31:36.584
I'll tell him. That was Kensi.

31:36.608 --> 31:38.754
Still no sign of Holgate.

31:38.778 --> 31:41.991
We've either got to charge this guy
or let him go.

31:43.167 --> 31:46.417
- And you didn't even bring doughnuts.
- No, I did not bring back doughnuts.

31:46.879 --> 31:49.097
I went back to the beach house
to walk the crime scene.

31:49.121 --> 31:51.754
- What did you find?
- This guy.

31:52.927 --> 31:54.776
Grozen. He's an L.A.P.D.

31:54.800 --> 31:57.508
There were two undercover cops
there.

32:06.732 --> 32:08.392
Recognise that guy?

32:08.609 --> 32:10.044
Should I?

32:10.068 --> 32:12.063
He's an L.A.P.D. Detective.

32:12.613 --> 32:15.780
That's right. There were two
undercover cops at that drug deal.

32:17.118 --> 32:20.617
If this guy is an undercover cop,
then he shot his partner.

32:23.874 --> 32:28.287
You're telling me
that this guy shot another cop?

32:28.838 --> 32:31.163
- This guy...
- Go, go.

32:32.007 --> 32:33.917
Shot this guy.

32:37.930 --> 32:39.484
I was there.

32:39.508 --> 32:42.742
But if this guy is L.A.P.D.,
then he's a dirty cop

32:42.766 --> 32:46.185
because I saw him kill his partner.

33:04.465 --> 33:06.588
So whose idea was it
to go to the beach house?

33:08.594 --> 33:10.278
Or I'll hand you over to L.A.P.D.
Okay?

33:10.302 --> 33:12.594
And see how those boys
treat cop killers.

33:13.224 --> 33:14.824
Jackson learned
that one of the suspects

33:14.848 --> 33:17.319
in Ramirez's death lived there.

33:17.343 --> 33:19.488
The guy was linked
to one of the Mexicali cartel.

33:19.512 --> 33:21.207
That why Jackson chose
the restaurant?

33:21.231 --> 33:23.083
Because it was close
to the beach house?

33:23.107 --> 33:25.825
Come on, Raspen. I'm throwing you
a lifeline here. Take it.

33:25.849 --> 33:28.127
Jackson wanted to plan an op
to go after the guy.

33:28.151 --> 33:30.587
Holgate tried to talk him out
of doing anything stupid.

33:30.611 --> 33:32.550
He obviously didn't do a very good job.

33:32.574 --> 33:35.210
He's answering quickly
with no real elaboration.

33:35.234 --> 33:39.517
Visual accessing cues are consistent.
I think he's telling the truth.

33:39.541 --> 33:43.350
Jackson kept talking about how
the president declared a war on drugs.

33:43.374 --> 33:45.230
And that's what
he was gonna bring them.

33:45.254 --> 33:47.190
Then, boom,
he bailed off into the water.

33:47.214 --> 33:49.980
- And you followed him?
- We didn't have a choice.

33:50.004 --> 33:51.980
We figured a cold swim
would sober him up,

33:52.004 --> 33:55.489
but he was so fired up
we couldn't catch him.

33:55.513 --> 33:58.494
By the time we did, he was at
the house and had secured a weapon.

33:58.518 --> 34:01.449
You're telling me you went unarmed
into the home of a drug dealer

34:01.473 --> 34:04.114
knowing full well that you were
outnumbered and outgunned?

34:04.138 --> 34:06.166
It was a little improvised.

34:06.190 --> 34:09.088
Besides, we knew they had weapons.
We could just take theirs.

34:09.112 --> 34:11.746
You gotta love SEALs.
Where's Holgate now?

34:11.771 --> 34:13.335
I've told you enough.

34:13.360 --> 34:14.791
He could be in serious danger.

34:14.815 --> 34:16.761
I'm not worried about Holgate.

34:16.784 --> 34:19.908
And I'm not saying anything else
until I see a JAG lawyer.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.411
Fair enough.

34:37.350 --> 34:39.318
This is a bad idea.

34:39.342 --> 34:40.976
Trust me, doc.

34:41.437 --> 34:43.928
Sometimes you've gotta let
the big dogs work it out.

34:48.194 --> 34:49.498
Let me guess.

34:49.522 --> 34:50.786
You're the bad cop.

34:50.810 --> 34:52.293
Something like that.

34:52.317 --> 34:54.375
Unless you're a lawyer,
I'm not talking to you,

34:54.399 --> 34:56.069
so save your breath.

34:57.828 --> 34:59.488
I'm not a lawyer, I'm a SEAL.

35:01.248 --> 35:02.256
What's our motto?

35:02.280 --> 35:05.055
The only easy day was yesterday.

35:05.079 --> 35:06.497
That's right.

35:07.046 --> 35:09.098
Now, things are about to get
really hard for you.

35:09.122 --> 35:10.899
Forget how stupid you were.

35:10.923 --> 35:12.894
You broke the most sacred vow
of all.

35:12.918 --> 35:14.612
Never leave a man behind.

35:14.636 --> 35:15.978
Okay, that was good.

35:16.002 --> 35:19.027
No matter what happens,
we never ever leave a man behind.

35:19.051 --> 35:20.659
But that's what you did to Jackson.

35:20.683 --> 35:23.888
- We didn't know he was shot.
- That's no excuse.

35:24.355 --> 35:27.581
- More of a reason to stay with him.
- We tried to help him.

35:27.605 --> 35:29.874
He was struggling with the money.
Holgate took it.

35:29.898 --> 35:31.836
- You stole the money?
- Jackson did.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.630
He was gonna give it
to Ramirez's widow.

35:33.654 --> 35:36.171
One minute he's swimming next to me,
the next, he's gone.

35:36.195 --> 35:37.920
So you just took the cash
and left him?

35:37.944 --> 35:40.716
We searched the water for him
for a couple of hours.

35:40.740 --> 35:41.920
Where is Holgate?

35:41.944 --> 35:43.509
I don't know.

35:43.533 --> 35:45.747
- Don't lie to me.
- I don't know.

35:48.921 --> 35:50.522
Slightly different technique.

35:50.546 --> 35:53.608
You left a man behind
and you're about to do it again.

35:53.632 --> 35:55.983
Because if we don't get to Holgate
before Grozen does,

35:56.007 --> 35:58.989
he's gonna wind up dead
just like Jackson.

35:59.013 --> 36:00.901
You'll have the blood
of two murdered SEALs

36:00.925 --> 36:02.760
on your hands.

36:04.520 --> 36:07.438
Holgate's holed up
in a motel in the valley.

36:10.735 --> 36:12.869
So, guys, how
are we gonna get Grozen to confess

36:12.893 --> 36:15.502
when his own people can't?

36:15.526 --> 36:18.271
Because we've got something
Grozen wants.

36:28.753 --> 36:31.101
Under the Sunset Strip in Hollywood.

36:31.125 --> 36:32.815
Wake up, sunshine.

36:32.839 --> 36:34.394
Time to go to work.

36:34.418 --> 36:36.631
You early risers out there.

36:45.895 --> 36:47.863
Hey, remember me?

36:47.887 --> 36:49.522
You shot my partner.

36:52.068 --> 36:54.416
The Navy wants to prosecute
as well.

36:54.440 --> 36:57.399
Whoever can give him the toughest
sentence should take him to trial.

36:57.740 --> 37:00.385
- Oh, I'm good with that.
- Don't turn your back on this guy.

37:00.409 --> 37:02.343
- He likes to run.
- Don't worry.

37:02.367 --> 37:04.695
His running days are over.

37:09.293 --> 37:11.084
Watch your head.

37:35.111 --> 37:37.375
- Where the hell is the money?
- What money?

37:37.399 --> 37:39.623
I'm gonna shoot you right here,
right now.

37:39.647 --> 37:41.210
You think I won't?

37:41.234 --> 37:43.044
Are we gonna be able to track him
as well?

37:43.068 --> 37:44.442
Like a tagged moose.

37:44.912 --> 37:46.596
I'm not gonna ask you
a second time.

37:46.620 --> 37:48.508
This guy is going to kill him.

37:48.532 --> 37:49.928
I don't have the money.

37:49.952 --> 37:52.390
- My partner does.
- What's his name?

37:52.414 --> 37:53.843
Raspen.

37:53.867 --> 37:55.185
Morris Raspen.

37:55.209 --> 37:56.899
Where do we find him?

37:56.923 --> 37:58.371
Probably at the golf course.

38:16.527 --> 38:18.566
Grozen and
Holgate coming up on your right.

38:22.575 --> 38:23.606
Anybody else?

38:25.661 --> 38:27.321
One bogey in the trees
by the clubhouse.

38:33.460 --> 38:37.185
Mm. The elusive Mr. Raspen.

38:37.209 --> 38:39.895
I thought your buddy was kidding
when he said golf course,

38:39.919 --> 38:41.728
but, you know, I get it now.

38:41.752 --> 38:45.983
Public place, yet, it's wide open,
so you can see anybody approaching.

38:46.007 --> 38:50.238
And you'd have to be a sharpshooter
to make a shot from any real cover.

38:50.262 --> 38:52.321
How many SEAL snipers
you got hidden around?

38:52.345 --> 38:54.573
I'm just working on my short game.

38:54.597 --> 38:56.102
Throw your piece in the pond.

39:00.404 --> 39:01.685
All of them.

39:07.077 --> 39:08.157
Where is the money?

39:09.163 --> 39:11.120
- In the bag.
- Back up for me.

39:19.757 --> 39:21.037
Oh, yeah.

39:21.383 --> 39:23.175
Okay.

39:25.179 --> 39:26.815
Wow.

39:26.839 --> 39:29.137
I should have brought a caddie.

39:36.524 --> 39:38.397
Why don't you go join your buddy?

39:39.276 --> 39:40.735
Come on.

39:45.574 --> 39:47.152
Put your hands up and drop.

39:51.163 --> 39:53.737
- Aah!
- Holgate is hit.

40:00.839 --> 40:02.274
- G?
- I'm good.

40:02.298 --> 40:04.174
- Kensi?
- We're good. Shooter is down.

40:10.641 --> 40:12.277
Hold this tight. Eric.

40:12.301 --> 40:13.639
Ambulances are en route.

40:15.729 --> 40:16.950
What happens now?

40:16.974 --> 40:19.140
Only easy day was yesterday.

40:46.093 --> 40:47.943
So, what's the word on Holgate?

40:47.967 --> 40:49.524
He's out of surgery.

40:49.548 --> 40:51.939
The docs figure
he'll have a full recovery.

40:51.963 --> 40:54.323
That's still not a lot of fun.

40:54.347 --> 40:57.163
Although, I do appreciate him
taking a bullet for me.

40:57.187 --> 41:00.699
I'm really trying to give up
getting shot so much.

41:00.723 --> 41:03.355
Yeah.
It's the least he could have done.

41:03.736 --> 41:04.767
Everybody go home?

41:06.071 --> 41:07.127
For the most part.

41:07.151 --> 41:09.090
Dom and Eric went to a club.

41:09.114 --> 41:11.382
Nate is debriefing Kensi
about her shooting

41:11.406 --> 41:13.344
over a Pink's chilli hot dog.

41:13.368 --> 41:15.138
I don't know where Hetty is.

41:15.162 --> 41:18.285
I'm sure that little ninja
is lurking around here somewhere.

41:23.130 --> 41:25.621
I'll bet you were really good
at Legos as a kid.

41:26.300 --> 41:27.628
Legos?

41:27.968 --> 41:31.111
You know, those little coloured-block
things you snap together?

41:31.135 --> 41:33.381
I know what Legos are.

41:35.726 --> 41:38.395
So are you still mad at Holgate
and those guys for what they did?

41:41.940 --> 41:45.191
I get why they did it.
I get what they did.

41:45.694 --> 41:48.505
When you're in combat together,
you trust someone with your life.

41:48.529 --> 41:50.654
It's a brotherhood forged in fire.

41:52.660 --> 41:54.736
Well, we've been shot at.

41:55.204 --> 41:56.449
A lot of times.

41:57.039 --> 41:59.304
I didn't mean it like that.

41:59.328 --> 42:01.599
We don't have a brotherhood
forged in fire?

42:01.623 --> 42:03.098
Okay, okay. Stop.

42:03.122 --> 42:04.979
I even brought you a beer
to cheer you up.

42:05.003 --> 42:07.580
Don't make me
break this rifle out again.

42:14.056 --> 42:15.277
Love you, man.

42:15.301 --> 42:17.265
Good night.
