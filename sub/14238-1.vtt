At a certain point
in my career as an artist

00:10.210 --> 00:14.507
I made a necessary decision
to discontinue suffering fools.

00:14.508 --> 00:16.942
My name is Eric Jonrosh.

00:16.944 --> 00:22.885
I had written a book, a bestseller,
called <i>The Spoils of Babylon.</i>

00:24.968 --> 00:26.999
Thank you, Doris.

00:27.919 --> 00:30.369
I had already been roughed up
by the Hollywood game

00:30.370 --> 00:33.137

<i>The Spoils of Alabama,</i>

00:33.628 --> 00:39.230
a production presumably starring
Tuesday Weld and Rod Steiger.

00:39.231 --> 00:41.708
I began principal photography
on <i>The Spoils of Babylon</i>

00:41.709 --> 00:43.903
at some juncture in 1976,

00:43.905 --> 00:47.437
ending production abruptly
in January of '79

I refuse to make clear.

The end result is nothing less
than a masterpiece.

01:05.238 --> 01:08.173
The original production
of <i>Spoils of Babylon</i>

01:08.175 --> 01:12.577
had a running time of 22 hours
and was considered...

01:12.579 --> 01:14.479
Not quite done with that.

01:14.825 --> 01:18.183
And was considered too long
for network television.

01:18.185 --> 01:23.188
Tonight's abbreviated version pales in
comparison and yet in my humble opinion,

01:23.190 --> 01:26.858
it is far superior to anything
on television today.

01:26.860 --> 01:28.828

assembled for the time.

Dirk Snowfield

01:36.369 --> 01:40.305

the hit television show <i>Telepathy Man.</i>

stage actor in his first film performance,

somewhat illustrious career as an author.
