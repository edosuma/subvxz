00:00.963 --> 00:02.997
To my dear friends,
Melissa and Sadie.

00:03.065 --> 00:04.465
- Aw.
- Five years together.

00:04.533 --> 00:05.833
- That is awesome.
- Hear, hear.

00:05.901 --> 00:07.368
- What is your secret?
- I don't really think there is

00:07.436 --> 00:09.170
a secret. I think
it's just about...

00:09.737 --> 00:11.472
love, understanding, and...

00:12.240 --> 00:13.173
two sets of boobs.

00:13.540 --> 00:15.208
I love boobs.
I love 'em.

00:16.006 --> 00:18.912
- I love...          - Okay
- ...everything about 'em.  - Yeah, I do, too.

00:18.980 --> 00:20.346
All different kinds.

00:20.414 --> 00:21.982
Yeah, that's my thing too.

00:22.050 --> 00:23.516
I love them.

00:23.585 --> 00:25.886
And the Curiosity Rover has touched down

00:25.954 --> 00:27.454
- on the planet of Mars.
- What's happening right now?

00:27.521 --> 00:28.220
What's happening
in there?

00:28.288 --> 00:29.188
Schmidt's in there

00:29.255 --> 00:30.590
with his boss.

00:31.157 --> 00:32.124
He's entertaining her.

00:32.192 --> 00:33.292
Ew.

00:33.359 --> 00:34.727
I don't care what he does.

00:34.795 --> 00:37.229
I just don't understand
why he has to narrate it!

00:37.297 --> 00:38.430
Robot arm engaged!

00:38.748 --> 00:40.349
It's just engaged now?

00:40.416 --> 00:42.484
So he's saying
everything up to this point

00:42.552 --> 00:44.085
has been foreplay?

00:44.153 --> 00:45.220
Are you kidding me?
That's ridiculous.

00:45.287 --> 00:46.387
What are you gonna do
for 20 minutes

00:46.455 --> 00:47.388
of foreplay?

00:47.456 --> 00:49.557
Boring! Yawn!

00:52.294 --> 00:53.995
Am I right, ladies?

00:54.063 --> 00:55.763
So, I actually know
what's about to happen next.

00:55.831 --> 00:57.999
- You will all want to cover your ears.
- I found water!

00:58.067 --> 01:00.433
- No, I didn't do it in time.
- Oh, he found...

01:00.501 --> 01:02.102
Has anybody seen a movie
in the last five months,

01:02.170 --> 01:05.605
and can you describe the plot
in great detail and loudly?

01:05.673 --> 01:08.108
- Okay, you're dry.
- Actually, I'm good. Thank you.

01:08.176 --> 01:10.177
Come on. I spent six dollars
on this wine.

01:10.245 --> 01:12.512
I've been looking for the right
time to tell you tonight,

01:12.580 --> 01:15.115
but Melissa and I are so excited

01:15.183 --> 01:16.916
because... Wow.

01:16.984 --> 01:18.751
That is so upsetting.

01:20.287 --> 01:22.221
What mission is this based on?!

01:22.289 --> 01:24.190
I'm pregnant!
We are pregnant!

01:24.258 --> 01:26.725
Wha...?

01:30.330 --> 01:33.699
Lesbian baby.
Congratulations, you guys.

01:42.741 --> 01:44.443
I feel so lucky,
you know?

01:44.511 --> 01:46.812
Like I really tucked this
one in just under the wire.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.313
What do you mean?
You're so young.

01:48.381 --> 01:50.281
As your friendly
neighborhood gynecologist,

01:50.348 --> 01:52.583
you should know that by
the time a lady hits 30,

01:52.651 --> 01:54.985
she loses about
90% of her eggs.

01:55.753 --> 01:56.788
- What?
No, th-that

01:56.855 --> 01:57.789
- can't be true.
- What?

01:57.856 --> 01:59.056
Did you know
that there's a test

01:59.124 --> 02:00.591
that you can take
that tells you how many beans

02:00.659 --> 02:02.092
- you got left in your bean sack?
- Ovaries.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.494
It estimates
basically

02:03.562 --> 02:05.261
how many childbearing
years you have left.

02:05.329 --> 02:06.362
Yeah, get this baloney:

02:06.431 --> 02:08.698
I'm 32, but my eggs are 48,

02:08.765 --> 02:11.668
and my vagina is 97.

02:11.736 --> 02:12.769
- I am so uncomfortable.
- But it gets

02:12.837 --> 02:14.638
better with age-- it's like

02:14.705 --> 02:16.606
- the vagina Helen Mirren.
- Oh, boy.

02:16.674 --> 02:17.941
I've got big plans
for the centennial.

02:18.008 --> 02:19.375
When can I take that test?

02:19.444 --> 02:20.176
Who cares?

02:20.244 --> 02:21.410
Personally, I'm still on

02:21.478 --> 02:23.078
the please-God-I-hope-
I'm-not-pregnant phase.

02:23.146 --> 02:24.447
- What am I doing here?
- You know, just

02:24.514 --> 02:25.915
clinically speaking,
it's probably

02:25.982 --> 02:27.483
- a good idea to know.
- I want

02:27.551 --> 02:28.484
to take this test! Like, now.

02:28.552 --> 02:29.685
Can we take this test right now?

02:29.753 --> 02:30.419
Morning, ladies.

02:30.487 --> 02:31.654
And Nick.

02:31.721 --> 02:32.788
- Morning?
- Well, I mean, I work

02:32.789 --> 02:33.923
nights now, so I'm

02:33.990 --> 02:35.491
on an adjusted
sleeping schedule.

02:35.559 --> 02:37.091
I just woke up,
here's my breakfast,

02:37.159 --> 02:38.860
I'm going to work.

02:38.928 --> 02:40.094
Take me with you! They're
talking about vaginas!

02:40.162 --> 02:41.329
I hate it! Take
me with you!

02:43.899 --> 02:46.434
Our bodies really
made something.

02:46.502 --> 02:48.536
I feel like we brought
manufacturing jobs

02:48.604 --> 02:50.037
- back to America.
- Yeah,

02:50.105 --> 02:51.205
it was fine.

02:51.273 --> 02:52.239
What do you mean "fine"?

02:52.307 --> 02:53.874
I broke your brain, girl.

02:53.942 --> 02:55.943
How do I put this delicately?

02:56.010 --> 02:57.177
I was...

02:57.244 --> 02:59.145
nowhere close to finishing.

02:59.913 --> 03:00.581
I was bored.

03:00.998 --> 03:02.248
And cold.

03:05.052 --> 03:08.121
That's cool. Uh...

03:09.189 --> 03:10.055
No, yeah.

03:12.225 --> 03:13.559
World shattered.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.962
We'll try again.
It'll be better.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.063
The world I once lived in...
shattered.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.131
All right, see you at work.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.001
See you at work.

03:22.068 --> 03:23.903
<i>Put me on the air.</i>
<i>I got something to say</i>

03:23.971 --> 03:25.570
about Andrew Bynum's hair.

03:25.638 --> 03:27.606
All right, caller,
you're up next.

03:27.673 --> 03:29.908
Look at you, man. This is great.

03:29.976 --> 03:31.309
You're the king
of your own castle.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.746
Look at this. What is this?

03:34.814 --> 03:37.115
Why do you need so many pens,
you big shot?

03:37.182 --> 03:38.783
I like what I do, man.
I finally feel like my life

03:38.851 --> 03:39.951
is moving
in the right direction.

03:40.019 --> 03:41.052
That is what I don't have

03:41.120 --> 03:42.487
in my life.

03:43.254 --> 03:44.188
But not anymore.

03:45.624 --> 03:47.125
I'm gonna take
one of these pens,

03:47.192 --> 03:48.659
I'm gonna go home,

03:48.727 --> 03:50.228
and I'm gonna write
my zombie novel.

03:51.630 --> 03:53.031
You don't think
I can do it, do you?

03:53.098 --> 03:54.465
You know, it's not that.
It's just that sometimes

03:54.533 --> 03:55.900
I get the feeling that you...

03:55.967 --> 03:57.167
don't want to write.

04:04.325 --> 04:06.225
No more excuses.
I'm gonna go home,

04:06.294 --> 04:07.894
and I'm gonna write that novel.

04:07.961 --> 04:09.095
And I'll be the
first to read it.

04:09.163 --> 04:10.830
- We got a deal, friend.
- Deal.

04:10.898 --> 04:12.565
Yeah, you still
have me on the line.

04:12.633 --> 04:14.466
My two cents? He's never gonna
write that book.

04:14.534 --> 04:17.067
- Why don't you shut up,
Manny from Cerritos?-  Okay.

04:17.136 --> 04:18.603
- Who asked you?
Hang up the phone.-  All right.

04:19.639 --> 04:20.639
We should go.

04:20.707 --> 04:21.940
Melissa's been drinking for two.

04:22.608 --> 04:23.309
Three.

04:23.376 --> 04:24.910
Awesome night, ladies.

04:24.978 --> 04:26.645
- Educational. Thank you.
- Sorry. I'm just...

04:26.713 --> 04:28.247
- Okay. I'm sorry.
- What?

04:28.315 --> 04:30.181
Sadie, before you leave, can I
just ask you a few questions?

04:30.249 --> 04:31.316
I know where this is going.

04:31.383 --> 04:32.450
You are a gynecologist

04:32.518 --> 04:34.085
<i>and</i> a lesbian,

04:34.153 --> 04:35.153
which makes you...

04:35.221 --> 04:36.221
well, a va-genius.

04:36.288 --> 04:37.288
- Jar.
- I know

04:37.356 --> 04:38.889
my way around a Grizzly Adams.

04:38.957 --> 04:39.991
You, too? Jar.

04:40.058 --> 04:41.426
- Wh...
- As an adult male,

04:41.494 --> 04:42.860
I would like to ask you a few

04:42.928 --> 04:44.195
questions about,
you know,

04:44.263 --> 04:45.662
the downstairs girl cookie.

04:45.730 --> 04:47.131
Jars, jars, all around jars!

04:47.198 --> 04:49.199
This is my personal time
right now.

04:49.267 --> 04:50.267
You can make an appointment
at my office,

04:50.835 --> 04:52.802
pay your $40 co-pay.

04:52.870 --> 04:54.671
I will be happy
to answer your questions.

04:54.739 --> 04:56.173
Yes! I'm in. Please.

04:56.241 --> 04:58.742
Now, would I have to put
my legs up in the stirrups?

04:58.809 --> 05:00.477
- Why would you?
- I'm asking more so out of curiosity

05:00.545 --> 05:02.679
- than fear. #excitement.
- Are you done?

05:02.747 --> 05:04.514
I'm done. I'll see you, okay?

05:04.581 --> 05:05.815
- I'm gonna call the office.
- Okay.

05:05.883 --> 05:07.917
Well, thank you, guys,
for the...

05:07.985 --> 05:09.686
awesome drunky

05:09.754 --> 05:11.420
- thing and the weirdly sobering end.
- Look,

05:11.488 --> 05:13.256
I know Sadie freaked you out
with all this talk about tests,

05:13.323 --> 05:14.524
but I just want
to remind you

05:14.591 --> 05:15.625
that at the end of the day,

05:15.693 --> 05:17.826
it's all about love.

05:17.894 --> 05:19.394
I mean, I love Sadie.

05:19.962 --> 05:20.896
I want

05:20.964 --> 05:22.898
my babies to have
her beautiful face.

05:22.966 --> 05:25.233
As long as they don't get
her big, fat man-feet.

05:25.301 --> 05:27.536
Yuck. Fingers crossed
we go donor on that one.

05:27.603 --> 05:28.904
Okay.

05:28.972 --> 05:30.305
- Let's make a graceful exit, my love.
- Okay.

05:30.373 --> 05:31.473
Hey, get out of here,

05:31.541 --> 05:32.708
you crazy lesbos,

05:32.776 --> 05:33.908
with your baby-making!

05:33.976 --> 05:35.176
- Ooh!
- Whoo!

05:35.243 --> 05:36.744
Ah! I'm married;
I'm not dead!

05:36.812 --> 05:38.279
See you. Night.

05:40.115 --> 05:42.550
Drive safely.

05:45.687 --> 05:47.388
90% of our eggs, huh?

05:47.955 --> 05:49.890
That's crazy. I'm panicking.

05:49.957 --> 05:50.891
You panicking?

05:50.958 --> 05:53.560
God, no. Babies
wreck you, Jess.

05:53.627 --> 05:55.595
They literally eat your body.

05:55.663 --> 05:57.630
I'm 30, I'm single,

05:57.699 --> 05:59.465
and I just started a new job.

05:59.533 --> 06:01.101
Tonight

06:01.169 --> 06:02.402
I used a bread roll

06:02.469 --> 06:03.770
to wipe butter off my face,

06:03.838 --> 06:05.738
and then I ate the bread roll,

06:05.806 --> 06:07.740
so I essentially used my face

06:07.808 --> 06:09.274
as a butter knife.

06:09.342 --> 06:10.642
I don't think
I'm ready

06:10.711 --> 06:12.411
to bring new life
into the world, but...

06:12.478 --> 06:14.747
what if all that's left
are the weird eggs?

06:14.815 --> 06:16.415
And the evil eggs?

06:16.482 --> 06:18.784
You have no evil eggs.

06:18.852 --> 06:20.485
I can feel them.
They're turning.

06:20.553 --> 06:21.520
They watched
their brothers

06:21.588 --> 06:22.721
and sisters die,

06:22.788 --> 06:24.589
and now they want to be birthed.

06:24.656 --> 06:26.191
I need to be fertilized.

06:27.927 --> 06:30.595
Fertilize me,
Los Angeles!

06:30.662 --> 06:31.830
Calm down, all right?

06:31.897 --> 06:33.364
You're overreacting.

06:33.432 --> 06:34.799
I am overreacting!
You know why?

06:34.867 --> 06:36.567
Because I want a family.

06:36.635 --> 06:38.368
I want to give my
nipples a purpose.

06:38.936 --> 06:40.738
Give my nipples a purpose!

06:40.805 --> 06:42.639
- Oh, yeah!
- Oh, God, that was a mistake.

06:42.707 --> 06:44.975
Duck down.
That was a mistake.

06:45.293 --> 06:46.743
We're taking that test.

06:47.729 --> 06:50.530
Well I think that you guys
made a really smart decision

06:50.598 --> 06:51.765
- coming in here today.
- Sadie,

06:51.833 --> 06:54.901
once at a senior
graduation party,

06:54.970 --> 06:58.204
I sat in a very hot Jacuzzi
for... 12 hours.

06:58.272 --> 07:00.340
Is there any chance
that I sunny-side upped my eggs?

07:00.407 --> 07:01.540
- No, Jess.
- Oh,

07:01.608 --> 07:03.476
between the years
of 1998 and 2005,

07:03.543 --> 07:05.378
I used a lot of self-tanner.

07:05.446 --> 07:06.779
Like, a <i>lot.</i>

07:06.847 --> 07:09.182
Is that a possibility of, um...

07:09.249 --> 07:10.350
- Do I... Okay.
- Nope.

07:10.417 --> 07:12.285
Here we go.

07:12.853 --> 07:14.219
I once fell on
a pommel horse...

07:14.287 --> 07:16.321
I'm gonna call you
when I get the results.

07:18.206 --> 07:19.591
This is good.

07:22.828 --> 07:25.397
I got nothing. This is...

07:27.050 --> 07:28.250
Whoa, whoa, Jess,
what are you doing?

07:28.317 --> 07:29.751
That's my ketchup collection!

07:29.818 --> 07:31.418
This fertility Web site
says I need to get rid

07:31.486 --> 07:32.954
of anything with toxins.

07:33.021 --> 07:34.155
Did you put the microwave
in the trash?

07:34.223 --> 07:35.056
- Yes.
- Why would you do that?

07:35.124 --> 07:36.758
Microwaves zap things!

07:36.825 --> 07:38.025
- You can't take my microwave away!
- Zap my insides!

07:38.093 --> 07:39.560
- It's the only thing I love!
- I can't risk it!

07:39.628 --> 07:41.129
- It's what makes burritos delicious!
- I don't care!

07:41.196 --> 07:44.198
You care about your burritos
more than my children, Nick?

07:44.266 --> 07:45.498
- You're putting me in a tough spot.
- Friends,

07:45.566 --> 07:48.034
I'm in a real-life
sex pickle.

07:48.102 --> 07:51.772
My inability to satisfy Emma
has thoroughly rocked me.

07:52.539 --> 07:53.506
I've tried everything.

07:54.574 --> 07:55.108
How about now?

07:55.176 --> 07:56.977
Hold on. I'm Shazam-ing
this song.

07:57.544 --> 07:58.912
Oh, for crying out loud!

07:58.980 --> 08:00.080
Guess what I'm
worried about?

08:00.148 --> 08:01.480
This sound.

08:01.547 --> 08:02.681
You know what
that sound is?

08:02.749 --> 08:04.750
It's the sound of
an empty uterus.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.485
I don't need test
results to tell me

08:06.552 --> 08:08.220
that it is <i>The Grapes</i>
<i>of Wrath</i> in there.

08:08.288 --> 08:09.388
It is 1930s

08:09.455 --> 08:11.123
Dust Bowl in there, Schmidt.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.692
And they're all walking
with limps.

08:13.760 --> 08:15.694
I can top that easily.
I'm having a hard time

08:15.762 --> 08:16.828
- with my zombie novel.
- Oh, not this...

08:16.896 --> 08:18.146
Are you literally

08:18.147 --> 08:19.998
comparing a zombie novel

08:20.065 --> 08:21.732
to my ability to create life?

08:21.801 --> 08:23.902
I'm a writer, Jess.
We create life.

08:23.969 --> 08:25.804
Ugh! Being a woman sucks!

08:25.871 --> 08:27.772
Preaching to the choir.
Women are the worst.

08:27.840 --> 08:29.707
Seriously, can you
please stop yelling?

08:29.775 --> 08:31.475
All right, now,
it's no big deal,

08:31.543 --> 08:33.443
but I'm on
an adjusted schedule.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.779
Sorry about this. Jess has
absolutely lost her mind.

08:35.847 --> 08:37.746
- I have not lost my mind!
- Yeah, you have.

08:37.816 --> 08:38.916
I'm just scared!

08:38.982 --> 08:40.017
Would you trust me?

08:40.083 --> 08:41.118
You're gonna be fine.

08:41.186 --> 08:42.785
You're gonna meet
somebody and...

08:42.854 --> 08:44.387
you're gonna fall in love
and then...

08:44.455 --> 08:46.190
before you know it,
you're gonna...

08:46.257 --> 08:47.557
With who, Nick?

08:47.625 --> 08:49.558
Who's gonna... lay a flag down

08:49.626 --> 08:51.327
on this sweet, sweet continent?

08:51.394 --> 08:53.329
I'll man up.
But I must warn you,

08:53.396 --> 08:55.164
Jess-- I don't have sperms.

08:55.232 --> 08:56.699
I have tadpoles.

08:56.766 --> 08:57.666
Of the gods.

08:57.734 --> 08:59.068
That's right.

08:59.136 --> 09:00.870
And I'm gonna give 'em to you.

09:00.938 --> 09:03.005
You can have 'em all,
for all I care.

09:03.073 --> 09:04.373
That's how much I love you.

09:04.441 --> 09:05.640
I feel your pain
in this situation.

09:05.708 --> 09:06.774
I want you to have babies.

09:06.843 --> 09:07.809
Take my sperms.

09:07.877 --> 09:09.577
No. It should be me, Jess.

09:09.645 --> 09:11.746
- What?
- With your big, beautiful blue eyes

09:11.814 --> 09:14.549
- and my...Blair Underwood-like skin,
- Mm-hmm.

09:14.616 --> 09:17.352
- We'd have the most beautiful baby the
world has ever seen. - He's not wrong.

09:17.419 --> 09:19.620
- It could get into any school it wants.
- Mm-hmm.

09:19.688 --> 09:23.590
To be clear, I haven't asked
any of you to impregnate me.

09:23.658 --> 09:25.692
I think it's important that
that's been said.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.261
Good, 'cause it's definitely
not me.

09:27.329 --> 09:28.996
Good, 'cause it's
definitely not you.

09:29.064 --> 09:31.631
I would love that little baby
with all my heart.

09:31.699 --> 09:33.133
Even if I did show it

09:33.201 --> 09:34.268
by picking him up from school

09:34.336 --> 09:35.502
in my underwear and...

09:35.570 --> 09:37.603
hitting on the crossing guard.

09:37.671 --> 09:38.971
- How's the zombie novel coming?
Good, good, good.

09:38.972 --> 09:39.839
I haven't written a word.

09:39.907 --> 09:41.174
Wait, are you serious?

09:41.242 --> 09:42.441
Nick, it's not
that hard, man.

09:42.509 --> 09:43.943
Just sit down and write.

09:44.011 --> 09:45.111
You ain't Hemingway.

09:45.179 --> 09:46.645
- You boys are right.
- Mm-hmm.

09:46.713 --> 09:48.414
I got to be more like Hemingway.

09:48.482 --> 09:49.648
I just lost another one
of my eggs

09:49.716 --> 09:51.017
while you were comparing
yourself

09:51.085 --> 09:52.418
to the most famous writer
of all time.

09:52.486 --> 09:53.886
Maybe the reason
I have writer's block

09:53.953 --> 09:56.421
is I've been living too casual
with you clowns.

09:56.489 --> 09:58.924
I need real-life
adventure

09:58.992 --> 10:01.659
like Ernest Hemingway had
at my age.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.661
Man, I got to run
with the bulls.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.530
I got to kill a man
with my bare hands

10:05.598 --> 10:07.132
after making sweet love to him

10:07.200 --> 10:09.633
and then sleep on the warm belly
of his horse.

10:09.701 --> 10:11.969
I got to eat my way out
of a sandwich house!

10:12.037 --> 10:13.437
How much you know
about Hemingway?

10:13.505 --> 10:15.306
Not a lot!
But I'm gonna learn!

10:15.374 --> 10:16.908
I'm becoming
Ernest Hemingway.

10:16.975 --> 10:18.109
You idiots.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.413
Schmidt.

10:22.880 --> 10:24.348
Yo.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.882
Okay, Schmidt.

10:25.950 --> 10:27.484
Female pleasure.

10:29.252 --> 10:30.586
Here are some diagrams,

10:31.154 --> 10:32.588
so we can see where you're at.

10:32.656 --> 10:33.623
The vagina.

10:34.140 --> 10:34.741
I'm familiar.

10:35.608 --> 10:37.006
Good.

10:37.044 --> 10:40.012
Now, what I typically do is
I start over here,

10:40.080 --> 10:42.013
and then I move here once

10:42.081 --> 10:44.349
I feel confident that this area

10:44.417 --> 10:45.617
- has been taken care of.
- Yeah, see,

10:45.685 --> 10:46.851
that's exactly what I do.

10:46.919 --> 10:49.421
I call that "Losing Nemo."

10:49.489 --> 10:52.724
Well, a more advanced move
would be...

10:52.792 --> 10:54.426
You know what?
I'll just show you.

10:54.494 --> 10:56.628
It's sort of...
Come in this way.

10:56.696 --> 10:58.797
No, no, I see what you're doing.
That asymmetry right there?

10:58.864 --> 11:00.565
That's crucial.
'Cause then what I'll do is

11:00.632 --> 11:02.000
is I'll go outside,

11:02.568 --> 11:04.502
get the paper,

11:04.570 --> 11:06.805
and shake the neighbor's hand.

11:06.872 --> 11:08.539
- Interesting.
- Then what I'll do is,

11:08.607 --> 11:11.843
I'll tie a bow on it
because it's birthday time.

11:11.911 --> 11:14.011
Then I get onstage
and collect my Oscar

11:14.079 --> 11:15.879
and say thank you
to the people,

11:15.947 --> 11:18.115
thank you to the people,
then get back down offstage

11:18.183 --> 11:20.550
and get everybody into
the sharing circle,

11:20.618 --> 11:22.252
right down there in
the sharing circle,

11:22.320 --> 11:23.820
and then...

11:23.887 --> 11:25.089
spike the volleyball.

11:25.156 --> 11:26.724
Then what I like
to do is, I like

11:26.791 --> 11:28.759
to arrive at the
bridge, meet the troll,

11:28.827 --> 11:31.327
and then answer
his riddles three.

11:31.394 --> 11:32.862
Then what we do
is, we're dancing.

11:32.930 --> 11:34.430
We're just gonna dance, we're
gonna dance for a while.

11:34.497 --> 11:36.332
We'll dance until you
can't dance anymore,

11:36.399 --> 11:38.367
dancing till you
can't dance anymore,

11:38.435 --> 11:40.603
and then everybody gets

11:42.170 --> 11:43.873
a churro.

11:50.213 --> 11:50.812
You okay?

11:50.880 --> 11:52.080
Mm-hmm.

11:57.887 --> 12:00.055
It's the baby hormones.

12:00.123 --> 12:02.423
They are not as gay as me.

12:02.491 --> 12:03.524
So I'm good at this, right?

12:03.592 --> 12:04.525
Schmidt,

12:04.593 --> 12:06.894
in my professional opinion,

12:06.962 --> 12:08.963
you have definitely
earned the rank of--

12:09.030 --> 12:11.666
and I will use the phrase
you coined-- va-genius.

12:14.136 --> 12:16.471
Thank you, thank
you so much.

12:16.538 --> 12:18.272
I really needed to
hear that, Sadie.

12:19.741 --> 12:21.975
You got to go.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.009
<i>Hey, Winston,</i>

12:23.077 --> 12:24.645
we're going on an adventure!

12:24.712 --> 12:27.781
We need real-life experience
like Hemingway.

12:29.984 --> 12:31.485
Whoo, I feel
like Hemingway.

12:31.552 --> 12:32.852
This is life
experience?

12:32.920 --> 12:34.687
Yeah, the zoo is the best
we can do, I told you,

12:34.755 --> 12:35.954
but it's got
everything we need.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.324
It's got life,
animals, man, beast.

12:38.392 --> 12:39.992
Look, I'm sorry, dude,
it's just, you know,

12:40.059 --> 12:41.494
I'm not supposed to
be awake right now

12:41.561 --> 12:43.829
- because of my adjusted...
- Adjusted schedule, yeah.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.130
Hey, man, 13
minutes of sleep.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.666
Honestly, Nick,
seriously,

12:46.733 --> 12:48.467
13 minutes of sleep--
that's all I got.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.769
You're starting to look
like a pillow to me.

12:49.836 --> 12:51.336
All I can think of is, like,

12:51.404 --> 12:53.705
"Man, Nick looks exactly
like a pillow to me."

12:53.773 --> 12:55.740
Hmm, what'd you say?
Winston, you need some sleep.

12:55.808 --> 12:56.874
- But I'm out here with you.
- Yeah.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.276
- Okay, because I love you.
- Thank you.

12:58.344 --> 12:59.544
And I want you to finish
your zombie book.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.245
Okay, but check out
where we are.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.880
This is experience,

13:02.948 --> 13:04.816
this is what's firing me up
to get back to writing.

13:04.883 --> 13:06.184
This is kind of
what it's all about.

13:07.051 --> 13:08.018
What are you doing?

13:08.019 --> 13:09.252
It's writer's fuel.

13:09.253 --> 13:10.788
That's what Hemingway said.

13:12.456 --> 13:14.625
Sadie, um, hey.

13:14.693 --> 13:15.959
Uh, I just,
I just want you to know

13:16.027 --> 13:17.661
that I am, um, I'm like--

13:17.729 --> 13:19.729
I am okay with whatever
you tell me.

13:19.797 --> 13:20.730
I'm just like,

13:20.798 --> 13:21.932
if you say

13:21.999 --> 13:23.732
you've got a year, that's fine.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.734
If you say, like, "You can have
kids till you're 80,"

13:25.802 --> 13:28.337
that's fine, too.
If you say, "You are barren,"

13:28.904 --> 13:31.541
um, I'm, I'm okay
with that, too.

13:31.608 --> 13:32.842
Um, just,

13:32.909 --> 13:35.110
why am I
the only one talking?

13:35.178 --> 13:36.245
Just lay it on me.

13:36.313 --> 13:37.413
What's inside my body?

13:37.481 --> 13:39.414
Everything looks
good, Jess.

13:39.482 --> 13:41.015
Your hormone levels
are outstanding.

13:41.083 --> 13:42.050
- What?
- Actually

13:42.117 --> 13:43.585
these are off
the charts

13:43.653 --> 13:44.786
for someone
your age.

13:44.854 --> 13:46.655
I mean, I don't know how

13:46.723 --> 13:48.523
you're walking around
with this many eggs.

13:48.591 --> 13:50.091
♪ I'm the egg queen ♪

13:50.659 --> 13:53.127
♪ I'm queen ♪
♪ of the eggs. ♪

13:53.795 --> 13:54.695
Right.

13:54.763 --> 13:56.364
- Cece.
- Mm-hmm.

14:01.069 --> 14:03.738
You know what?
Maybe we should talk in private.

14:09.190 --> 14:11.457
Cece, Cece.

14:11.526 --> 14:13.092
Cece, wait, do
you want to talk?

14:13.660 --> 14:15.001
Jess, you don't get it.

14:15.209 --> 14:17.030
Sadie basically just
told me that if I want

14:17.098 --> 14:19.766
to have a kid,
I've got to start right now.

14:19.834 --> 14:22.101
<i>Right</i> now.

14:22.168 --> 14:24.069
I thought I had
all of this time.

14:25.637 --> 14:28.073
I didn't want to have
to think about this.

14:28.141 --> 14:30.609
I know, I know,
I'm sorry.

14:30.676 --> 14:32.077
I made you
take the test.

14:32.145 --> 14:34.246
What can I do?

14:35.063 --> 14:37.482
Make me a guy so I don't have
to worry about this.

14:40.952 --> 14:43.121
You know what? Yes.

14:43.188 --> 14:46.724
Yeah, let's be guys
just for today.

14:46.792 --> 14:48.793
Let's, let's care
about stupid things,

14:49.161 --> 14:52.296
talk about sharks
and sci-fi movies

14:52.364 --> 14:55.031
and making
everything wireless.

14:55.099 --> 14:57.934
"Dude, my phone is wireless,
my computer is wireless.

14:58.002 --> 14:59.702
- Everything's wireless, yeah."
- You're a terrible guy.

14:59.771 --> 15:00.703
"Come on."

15:02.339 --> 15:03.506
No, I'm the best guy.

15:03.574 --> 15:05.142
Come on, come on.

15:05.209 --> 15:06.542
All right.

15:06.610 --> 15:07.844
<i>Okay, how was that?</i>

15:08.912 --> 15:09.812
Eh.

15:09.813 --> 15:11.680
Why, though,
with the "eh"?

15:11.748 --> 15:15.450
Unbelie-- but I played out
your most secret fantasy:

15:15.518 --> 15:17.119
French maid
handyman does...

15:17.187 --> 15:20.122
- Studio 54...
- Studio 54 busboy.

15:20.190 --> 15:22.324
- I know, it's disappointing.
- I thought I killed it.

15:22.392 --> 15:24.626
And I picked you at work because
I heard you were amazing in bed.

15:24.694 --> 15:27.095
I-- no, no, no, I am,
okay, I know that I am.

15:27.163 --> 15:29.664
I have it on good authority
from my model ex-girlfriend

15:29.731 --> 15:32.500
and an actual
lesbian gynecologist

15:32.567 --> 15:37.005
that I know exactly what I'm
doing, so it's got to be you.

15:37.072 --> 15:39.140
It's us--
this doesn't work.

15:39.208 --> 15:41.442
When I got divorced I-I,

15:41.510 --> 15:42.609
I thought
I could go out there

15:42.677 --> 15:44.845
and have
all these new experiences--

15:44.913 --> 15:48.282
the contract of sex
with someone at work

15:48.349 --> 15:51.118
who's so far
beneath me, you know,

15:51.186 --> 15:53.653
someone basically
just powerless.

15:53.721 --> 15:56.790
I guess I have
to feel something.

15:56.858 --> 15:58.657
Okay, see, I'm not like that.

15:58.725 --> 16:00.126
I don't even understand
that concept.

16:00.194 --> 16:01.760
My ex-girlfriend the
model-- she's a model.

16:01.829 --> 16:03.529
- I know she's a model.
- We'd have sex,

16:03.596 --> 16:06.232
and it was just like, I was
happy, you know, I, I...

16:06.300 --> 16:08.367
We were connected, I wasn't
thinking about anything.

16:08.435 --> 16:09.568
What is that?

16:09.636 --> 16:11.103
That is love, you idiot.

16:14.673 --> 16:15.941
That's love.

16:18.410 --> 16:19.911
Yuck.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.346
- It sucks.
- So, what, do I have

16:21.413 --> 16:23.581
to, I have to, like, be in love
now to have good sex?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.750
Think about me--
I got to go out in the world

16:25.818 --> 16:28.286
and meet people, date.

16:28.354 --> 16:29.287
You're going
to be great.

16:30.655 --> 16:31.621
You think?

16:31.689 --> 16:33.523
Yeah.

16:33.591 --> 16:35.827
Consider
our sex contract void.

16:36.895 --> 16:37.928
How am I gonna get
the feathers off?

16:37.996 --> 16:39.096
I have no idea.

16:40.365 --> 16:42.032
Jess and that girl!

16:42.100 --> 16:43.600
Uh...

16:44.968 --> 16:47.503
Oh, I'm so glad they're here.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.138
So you're getting a lot
of work done here, huh?

16:49.206 --> 16:51.474
- Who wins-- me versus gorilla? Go.
- Gorilla.

16:51.541 --> 16:52.909
Me versus gorilla.

16:52.977 --> 16:54.344
- Gorilla.
- No, but in a contest.

16:54.412 --> 16:56.346
- Gorilla.
- Yeah, but in a competition.

16:56.413 --> 16:57.712
Uh, gorilla.

16:57.713 --> 16:58.714
You don't get it.

16:58.782 --> 16:59.648
Okay, are you just

16:59.716 --> 17:00.984
drunk at the zoo right now?

17:00.985 --> 17:02.817
- Let's go look at snakes.
- Okay.

17:02.886 --> 17:03.818
Where are the snakes?!

17:03.887 --> 17:05.153
All day.

17:05.221 --> 17:06.755
You know what?

17:06.821 --> 17:08.623
I don't think we should
act like the guys.

17:08.691 --> 17:10.492
Jess, what am I going to do?

17:16.232 --> 17:19.000
What am I going
to tell Robby?

17:19.067 --> 17:22.069
You are a Mexican
West Coast rattlesnakes,

17:22.137 --> 17:24.405
and they call you "fang-tastic."

17:25.874 --> 17:27.473
No one ever calls me
anything like that.

17:27.541 --> 17:28.609
Nick, what are you doing?

17:28.676 --> 17:29.944
This is not life experience;

17:30.012 --> 17:32.446
This is procrastination
at the zoo.

17:32.514 --> 17:33.914
- I don't think it is.
- Now, I need some sleep.

17:33.981 --> 17:35.315
- I got to work tonight.
- Okay,

17:35.316 --> 17:37.983
- congratulations, I'm glad you found
your passion...    - Okay, look...

17:37.984 --> 17:39.551
...and that you
love what you do.

17:39.552 --> 17:40.520
- Wow.
- But enough's enough.

17:40.587 --> 17:42.722
- Don't throw it in my face.
- Is it like that, is it like that, Nick?

17:42.790 --> 17:44.157
- Don't throw it in my face.
- Nick, I got off

17:44.225 --> 17:46.326
- my adjusted schedule...
- Don't say "adjusted schedule."

17:46.394 --> 17:47.428
- That's super annoying.
- Adjusted schedule.

17:47.495 --> 17:48.829
- Stop saying it.
- Adjusted schedule.

17:48.897 --> 17:50.530
You say it again,
I'm gonna let the snakes out.

17:50.597 --> 17:52.331
Adjusted schedule.
Let the snakes out.

17:54.033 --> 17:55.568
I will let...

17:55.636 --> 17:58.170
- These guys have done a pretty good
job keeping it sealed.   - Yeah, yeah.

17:58.238 --> 17:59.905
- Nick, you're not a finisher.
- Oh, I'm a finisher.

17:59.973 --> 18:01.240
You're not a finisher at all, man.

18:01.308 --> 18:03.375
- That's why you didn't finish law school.
- Don't do that.

18:03.444 --> 18:05.577
The same reason you're only three
episodes into <i>Downton Abbey.</i>

18:05.645 --> 18:07.579
- There's just too many characters, it's
hard to follow.   - Yeah, yeah, yeah,

18:07.647 --> 18:10.348
I get it, man, you're scared,
and that's okay-- be scared.

18:10.716 --> 18:11.916
Just stop wasting my time
because I'm tired

18:11.984 --> 18:13.885
and I need to sleep
because I want to work tonight

18:14.453 --> 18:15.787
at the job I'm passionate about.

18:17.924 --> 18:20.358
I'm glad you called me;
I love the zoo.

18:20.926 --> 18:22.492
You think
I'm like a bear?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.394
I mean, I kind of
move like a bear,

18:24.462 --> 18:26.863
and I got that really
long, sharp toenail

18:26.931 --> 18:28.131
that you love
so much.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.805
Hey.

18:37.340 --> 18:38.840
Randa.

18:39.443 --> 18:40.944
It says here you're 43.

18:41.511 --> 18:42.912
Keeping it tight, girl.

18:45.815 --> 18:46.983
What do you
think of kids?

18:47.050 --> 18:47.784
I love kids.

18:47.852 --> 18:48.985
I would like to have
children someday.

18:49.552 --> 18:50.553
- Someday?
- Well, yeah,

18:50.621 --> 18:51.955
like in ten years or something.

18:52.022 --> 18:53.856
Yeah.

18:56.925 --> 18:58.259
I have a lot of eggs.

18:58.327 --> 18:59.760
Unfortunately

18:59.828 --> 19:02.663
I don't have a lot of sausage.

19:04.266 --> 19:06.767
Yeah, I shouldn't be
complaining.

19:09.372 --> 19:11.405
I'll be okay.

19:14.372 --> 19:18.005

<font color="#ff8c00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

19:18.188 --> 19:19.422
- Hey, Winston.
- Aah, what?

19:19.490 --> 19:20.924
Sorry to wake you.

19:20.992 --> 19:22.725
<i>- Z is for Zombie.</i>
- What?

19:22.792 --> 19:23.959
I finished my novel.

19:24.027 --> 19:25.928
I stayed up
for 14 straight hours.

19:25.996 --> 19:27.429
I even peed in water bottles.

19:28.497 --> 19:29.631
We have a bathroom.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.034
Wow, you dedicated
it to me.

19:32.502 --> 19:34.452
"To Winston.
Have a nice summer.

19:34.470 --> 19:35.470
Hope to see you ag..."

19:35.938 --> 19:36.739
Really?

19:36.806 --> 19:38.973
I just want to say right now,
the black guy dies early--

19:39.041 --> 19:39.940
his name is William--

19:40.008 --> 19:40.974
but don't take offense;

19:41.042 --> 19:42.943
It's a staple of the genre.

19:43.011 --> 19:44.311
I can't take this--
too much anxiety.

19:44.379 --> 19:45.846
I'm going to my room.

19:47.081 --> 19:49.082
Hey, Winston,
are you reading it?

19:49.151 --> 19:49.983
Hey.

19:50.051 --> 19:51.252
Oh, hey.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.188
I knew it.

19:54.256 --> 19:56.257
I knew you'd choose me
to get you pregnant.

19:57.324 --> 19:59.058
Yep, let's go.

19:59.126 --> 20:00.326
Jess.

20:02.762 --> 20:03.596
Schmidt.

20:05.616 --> 20:07.433
I think I may have been
in love with Cece.

20:07.501 --> 20:08.702
- You are in love with Cece.
- You think?

20:08.703 --> 20:11.170
Can't believe I have to have
feelings to have good sex.

20:11.237 --> 20:13.071
I was hoping I'd be dead
before this happened.

20:13.139 --> 20:14.739
Hey, why are we all hanging out
in my room

20:14.807 --> 20:15.774
and sitting on my bed?

20:15.841 --> 20:17.709
Nick, this is

20:17.777 --> 20:20.879
the worst thing I have ever read
in my entire life.

20:20.946 --> 20:22.214
You misspelled
the word "rhythm"

20:22.282 --> 20:23.549
38 times.

20:23.616 --> 20:25.350
<i>- Z is for Zombie?</i>
- Yeah, <i>Z Is for Zombie.</i>

20:25.418 --> 20:26.685
- The zombie novel.
- Yeah.

20:26.752 --> 20:27.719
"Rhythm" is
a tough word.

20:27.787 --> 20:29.253
- Don't feel bad about that.
- Yeah, thanks, man.

20:29.321 --> 20:30.755
- Did you get to the word search?
- Yeah.

20:30.823 --> 20:32.623
I put a word search
in the novel,

20:33.192 --> 20:33.957
but the joke's on you.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.726
There aren't any words in there,

20:35.794 --> 20:37.961
so you're just gonna be staring
at letters, you idiot.

20:38.029 --> 20:40.330
But you know what?
You finished it,

20:40.398 --> 20:42.866
and for that, my friend,
I'm proud of you.

20:42.934 --> 20:44.702
- Thank you, I did finish it, I finished something.
- Yeah, you finished something.

20:45.269 --> 20:46.336
Read it out loud,
Winston.

20:47.404 --> 20:48.471
Read it out loud.

20:48.539 --> 20:49.806
Read it out loud.

20:49.873 --> 20:51.974
- Read it out loud... - Okay, I'll read
this damn thing; you asked for it.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.543
This might be humiliating.

20:54.611 --> 20:58.214
"No one in the sleepy mountain
town of 'Writhe-em' City..."

20:58.281 --> 20:59.582
That's Rhythm City.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.317
"...knew what the meteor meant,
but the one thing

21:01.384 --> 21:04.653
Mike Jr. did have was
a whole lot of 'rittems.'"

21:04.722 --> 21:07.155
- Rhythm.  - No, yeah.
- "'Whoa, what bit me

21:07.223 --> 21:10.591
in the face?' Mike Jr. said
to his dad Mike Sr., who sucks."

21:10.592 --> 21:12.627
Sucks-- Mike Sr. sucks.

21:12.695 --> 21:14.229
It's a major theme
throughout this.

21:14.296 --> 21:15.697
"Mike Sr. sucks a whole bunch,

21:15.765 --> 21:17.465
much more
than his neighbor Rallo."

21:17.533 --> 21:19.300
Never stop
reading this.

21:19.368 --> 21:22.502
"'Zombie zoo, zombie zoo,
zombie zoo, zombie zoo.

21:22.570 --> 21:25.706
"'Who let them zombies
out that damn zombie zoo?

21:25.774 --> 21:27.842
Uh-oh, watch your back, Laura.'"

21:27.909 --> 21:29.143
And I guess Laura is
another character

21:29.211 --> 21:31.112
that he introduces,
but that's it.

21:31.179 --> 21:32.346
<i>And here's the word search.</i>

21:32.413 --> 21:33.948
<i>Yeah, good luck, you idiot.</i>
