[rumbling ambient music fades]

01:04.980 --> 01:06.679
Well, look at you.

01:06.681 --> 01:08.883
- It's been a long time.
- Too long.

01:10.119 --> 01:11.586
Couldn't get a black one?

01:12.554 --> 01:14.754
- Cheaper.
- Free.

01:14.756 --> 01:17.892
- Oh, God. Beat me every time.
- Yeah.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.227
So, should we talk
about the weather

01:21.229 --> 01:22.828
or do you wanna give me a hug?

01:22.830 --> 01:25.030
- Hug, yeah.
- I missed you so much.

01:25.032 --> 01:26.033
I missed you.

01:30.738 --> 01:32.804
I still hate shotgun.

01:32.806 --> 01:34.940
I won't ride it at night.

01:34.942 --> 01:36.707
If someone's driving me I just

01:36.709 --> 01:38.210
sit in the back
like they're my chauffeur.

01:38.212 --> 01:40.245
Oh, really? How proper of you.

01:40.247 --> 01:41.748
[soft instrumental music]

01:42.982 --> 01:45.316
- So you checked, she's not home?
- I checked and double checked.

01:45.318 --> 01:48.252
- I think we're good.
- Let's get this party started.

01:48.254 --> 01:49.353
Let's do it.

01:49.355 --> 01:51.623
[upbeat drum music]

02:00.298 --> 02:02.533
[Keaton] I like it. It's lovely.

02:03.201 --> 02:04.802
Are you ready?

02:06.037 --> 02:07.772
Boom.

02:13.711 --> 02:15.012
[Keaton] Oh, Jesus.

02:16.914 --> 02:18.980
Oh, Jesus
Look he's a family man.

02:18.982 --> 02:22.819
[Robin] God. He's so domestic,
settling down.

02:28.358 --> 02:29.689
[Robin] There's sleeping beauty.

02:29.691 --> 02:30.791
[Keaton] God. He's shirtless.

02:30.793 --> 02:32.594
I gotta grab his sweaty ass.

02:34.096 --> 02:35.831
[they grunt]

02:36.698 --> 02:38.133
[Robin] Oh, shit.

02:40.269 --> 02:42.570
- Robin?
- Night, night.

02:43.138 --> 02:44.139
Night, night.

02:46.275 --> 02:50.743
- You chloroformed him?
- It was a plan B sort of thing.

02:50.745 --> 02:52.244
I knew he wouldn't go down
without a fight.

02:52.246 --> 02:54.713
- There's your proof.
- That was a real date rapist

02:54.715 --> 02:56.048
move right there, Keats.

02:56.050 --> 02:58.317
It's ether from
a photography store.

02:58.319 --> 03:02.288
Besides, who knees a guy in the
balls right when he wakes up?

03:02.290 --> 03:03.857
Self-defense class.

03:04.858 --> 03:05.990
You're a monster.

03:05.992 --> 03:07.994
[upbeat drum music continues]

03:21.974 --> 03:24.740
- You break into my house...
- It was unlocked.

03:24.742 --> 03:26.776
Shut up.

03:26.778 --> 03:28.911
- You kneed me in the nuts.
- Yeah, I did that.

03:28.913 --> 03:30.414
- You drugged me.
- Ether.

03:30.416 --> 03:31.914
Then you throw me in the trunk

03:31.916 --> 03:33.316
with this shit
and drive around for

03:33.318 --> 03:35.184
what, two and a half,
three fucking hours?

03:35.186 --> 03:38.755
- I hit every pot hole though.
- Yes, that you did.

03:41.359 --> 03:43.792
No, no! Not my hair!

03:43.794 --> 03:44.895
[Robin] No!

03:45.963 --> 03:49.297
Next person that gets hitched,
gets a fist to the cock

03:49.299 --> 03:52.067
- or a punch to the...
- Dibs on the cunt punch.

03:52.069 --> 03:53.068
[Robin laughs]

03:53.070 --> 03:54.869
Looks like you already got one.

03:54.871 --> 03:56.937
- Yeah, gee.
- Was that from...?

03:56.939 --> 03:58.973
- Good, I'm glad.
- What did you do?

03:58.975 --> 04:00.207
Yeah, it feels great.

04:00.209 --> 04:01.777
[bell rings]

04:02.378 --> 04:04.178
Red river.

04:04.180 --> 04:06.082
[soft instrumental music]

04:09.152 --> 04:10.783
No way.

04:10.785 --> 04:12.954
So I just best-manned
the shit out of this.

04:19.961 --> 04:24.062
- Come here, you asshole.
- It's good to see you, buddy.

04:24.064 --> 04:27.799
- Don't mind my morning wood.
- Yeah, pants first.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.204
- And some deodorant.
- You're gonna love that.

04:32.173 --> 04:36.008
Odd choice of wardrobe.
How terrible.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.743
Let me guess, Keats packed
my clothes all by himself.

04:38.745 --> 04:41.147
I didn't pack that
in the dark, no way.

04:50.356 --> 04:53.524
So, how did you guys
pull this whole thing off?

04:53.526 --> 04:55.459
I had,

04:55.461 --> 04:58.161
inside man. <i>Woman.</i>

04:58.163 --> 05:00.130
Oh, Melanie was in on this too?

05:00.132 --> 05:01.998
Why'd you think she
had to "go out of town"

05:02.000 --> 05:03.400
on business last night?

05:03.402 --> 05:04.767
Ah.

05:04.769 --> 05:06.305
And as the cherry on top...

05:07.539 --> 05:09.405
- Remember this?
- Let me see that.

05:09.407 --> 05:12.408
It's got all the distilleries
in it from ten years ago.

05:12.410 --> 05:15.144
- [Gordie] Holy smokes.
- [Keaton] Yes, Red River,

05:15.146 --> 05:17.114
- Yeah, but wait...
- Bristol.

05:18.282 --> 05:21.082
- [Keaton] Drum roll.
- [Gordie] Arcadia.

05:21.084 --> 05:23.851
- [Robin] It's still there.
- We're gonna find it this time.

05:23.853 --> 05:25.220
Hell or high water.

05:25.222 --> 05:27.021
At each distillery
we are going to get a

05:27.023 --> 05:29.157
Polaroid of ourselves
for the scrapbook.

05:29.159 --> 05:32.059
Ten years later, sort of thing.
And to commemorate

05:32.061 --> 05:34.295
this second crack at the
blue grass bourbon trail,

05:34.297 --> 05:37.431
we are going to start with
Gordie's favorite distillery.

05:37.433 --> 05:40.033
The one that went down
the wrong tube for Robin,

05:40.035 --> 05:41.868
which will all know was bullshit

05:41.870 --> 05:43.869
and made her hurl
all over the bar-top.

05:43.871 --> 05:45.505
[country music]

05:45.507 --> 05:47.307
[they laugh]

05:47.309 --> 05:49.077
What the fuck?

05:50.311 --> 05:52.245
- What the fuck is...
- Cool.

05:52.247 --> 05:54.380
So you remembered
the chloroform,

05:54.382 --> 05:56.983
but you forgot to
check if the place

05:56.985 --> 05:58.517
was still an operational
God damn distillery.

05:58.519 --> 06:01.853
- It was ether.
- Welcome to Red River winery,

06:01.855 --> 06:04.322
- have you been here before?
- Kind of.

06:04.324 --> 06:06.458
We were here when
it was a distillery.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.526
Wow, that was a few years ago.

06:08.528 --> 06:11.429
- Yeah, ten.
- Their bourbon wasn't so hot.

06:11.431 --> 06:14.432
People said it tasted
like unrefined motor oil,

06:14.434 --> 06:17.167
so the owners decided
to convert it into a winery,

06:17.169 --> 06:19.069
carry the name over, re-brand.

06:19.071 --> 06:20.904
It took a couple
of years, but now

06:20.906 --> 06:23.376
business is
booming as you can see.

06:24.176 --> 06:27.611
- Did you say motor oil?
- We have a sublime Merlot.

06:27.613 --> 06:29.946
I will fucking
buy you another one.

06:29.948 --> 06:31.482
It's fine, it works fine.

06:31.484 --> 06:34.217
- Just gotta fiddle it.
- You have a yard sale problem.

06:34.219 --> 06:39.090
- C'mon. Say wine and cheese.
- Oh, yeah.

06:40.325 --> 06:42.960
Memories. I'm going
to get some Merlot.

06:48.299 --> 06:50.868
How's it going? You could
fill it up a little more.

06:52.436 --> 06:54.436
I'm sorry, man.
I should've checked.

06:54.438 --> 06:55.903
Hey, hey.

06:55.905 --> 06:58.105
It's great,
the whole thing's great.

06:58.107 --> 07:00.009
Wine will still get
you wrecked, right?

07:00.577 --> 07:02.111
- Have at it.
- Yeah.

07:04.447 --> 07:06.180
- We'll have a good time, right?
- Yeah.

07:06.182 --> 07:08.282
- That's right. Alright.
- OK.

07:08.284 --> 07:09.352
Go get 'em.

07:11.487 --> 07:13.253
What do you say, Gordie?

07:13.255 --> 07:15.989
I'm actually relieved it's
not a distillery anymore.

07:15.991 --> 07:17.457
Yeah?

07:17.459 --> 07:18.994
Yeah.

07:20.329 --> 07:22.863
That wine stinks, I think
I'm gonna go for a stroll.

07:24.266 --> 07:26.599
It is sad to see it go, though.

07:26.601 --> 07:28.269
All good things come to an end.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.225
[door bells jingle]

07:56.962 --> 07:59.231
[radio chatter
in the background]

08:41.669 --> 08:43.239
Y'all lose anything?

08:44.072 --> 08:46.172
Nope, just browsing.

08:46.174 --> 08:48.309
And breaking stuff too.

08:49.478 --> 08:52.280
- Was this working before?
- Let's say, yes.

08:53.581 --> 08:56.215
You in town for
the Haunted Hayride?

08:56.217 --> 08:57.951
The haunted what?

08:58.753 --> 09:00.220
Hayride.

09:01.088 --> 09:03.121
- Nope.
- Only three things

09:03.123 --> 09:04.757
bring folks to Red River
this time of year:

09:04.759 --> 09:08.226
The Colonia, the Haunted Hayride
and the winery down the street.

09:08.228 --> 09:11.964
- You must be a wine guy.
- Yeah, I'm not a wine guy.

09:12.633 --> 09:15.567
I'm a... I was a bourbon guy.

09:15.569 --> 09:18.502
Came in town expecting your
distillery and you got a winery.

09:18.504 --> 09:21.238
Yeah, my favorite
distillery no less.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.009
Pa would've been
happy to hear that.

09:26.579 --> 09:28.244
Carolyn?

09:28.246 --> 09:30.447
I was wondering when
you was gon' get wise.

09:30.449 --> 09:32.683
Jesus. The last time
I saw you, you were like,

09:32.685 --> 09:34.317
- this tall.
- Yeah.

09:34.319 --> 09:36.388
- Wow, ten years?
- Yeah.

09:39.124 --> 09:41.524
Well, what are you
doin' here anyways?

09:41.526 --> 09:45.196
- Bourbon trail, bachelor party.
- Who's the one gettin' hitched?

09:46.130 --> 09:47.563
Oh.

09:47.565 --> 09:50.401
I better hurry up
and get my wedding dress then.

09:51.202 --> 09:52.801
You don't remember?

09:52.803 --> 09:54.703
You and your pals
came in to visit

09:54.705 --> 09:56.805
like you always did,

09:56.807 --> 09:58.372
it was Christmas time,

09:58.374 --> 10:01.110
and you were wearing
this sweater with...

10:01.812 --> 10:04.378
I think it was a big red moose?

10:04.380 --> 10:06.681
- It was a buck.
- Right, a big red buck.

10:06.683 --> 10:08.816
Yeah, I got down on one
knee and proposed to you

10:08.818 --> 10:11.153
with a little twist tie ring.

10:12.254 --> 10:13.623
You never did come back.

10:14.791 --> 10:16.558
Yeah, we got home that night...

10:19.328 --> 10:22.331
Well, I got drafted.
Life happened.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.131
Wow.

10:26.133 --> 10:27.433
[they laugh]

10:27.435 --> 10:29.704
I remember all of this stuff.

10:30.738 --> 10:34.707
Let's see. This was above
the urinal, for sure.

10:34.709 --> 10:38.243
Spent a lot of time in
there for some reason.

10:38.245 --> 10:41.246
- I bet you did.
- Oh, no way.

10:41.248 --> 10:43.448
- You're gonna hate me.
- Why?

10:43.450 --> 10:44.584
I think...

10:45.719 --> 10:48.087
Yep. There it is.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.455
I should Kill you.
I'm about to add

10:50.457 --> 10:52.322
this to your tab,
along with the broken watch.

10:52.324 --> 10:55.492
It wasn't me,
I blame the other guy.

10:55.494 --> 10:57.728
- Oops.
- Breaking all kind of things.

10:57.730 --> 11:00.797
Nope, it's still in
one piece. Look at that.

11:00.799 --> 11:02.332
Oh, man.

11:02.334 --> 11:04.334
- Yeah.
- Didn't know we still had that?

11:04.336 --> 11:06.335
Probably the last
one in existence.

11:06.337 --> 11:07.638
Really?
And I almost shattered it.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.840
You almost
shattered the last one

11:09.842 --> 11:12.475
in existence. I got an idea.

11:12.477 --> 11:15.446
Alright, I like your ideas.

11:16.347 --> 11:18.614
- To getting hitched.
- No, I can't.

11:18.616 --> 11:21.349
The southern hospitality
dictates, "you say, no.

11:21.351 --> 11:23.118
And I say, yes."
And We go back and forth

11:23.120 --> 11:25.420
a bunch of times until you
finally agree, which is what

11:25.422 --> 11:27.255
you want to do anyway.
You want to take it.

11:27.257 --> 11:29.293
Remember when I said
I was a bourbon guy?

11:30.727 --> 11:32.259
I was.

11:32.261 --> 11:33.895
- Hell. I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

11:33.897 --> 11:37.766
- How were you supposed to know?
- That's why you never came back?

11:37.768 --> 11:39.500
Not exactly.

11:39.502 --> 11:41.502
I don't wanna be a part of
you fallin' off the wagon,

11:41.504 --> 11:43.537
- or get back on, or whatever.
- It's not falling off,

11:43.539 --> 11:45.406
but no, this is just
like anything else.

11:45.408 --> 11:50.443
This is like pills, or guns
or diet and exercise,

11:50.445 --> 11:52.679
it's all about who's
doing it, who's using it.

11:52.681 --> 11:54.914
I just have to do one thing
and that's keep it

11:54.916 --> 11:56.749
bottled up. Right, sign? Right.

11:56.751 --> 11:58.751
Best-man don't know
you very well, bourbon trail

11:58.753 --> 12:01.153
- for your bachelor party?
- Yeah. Well, it's something

12:01.155 --> 12:05.591
we did a long time ago back when
it was OK for me to partake.

12:05.593 --> 12:08.527
Anyways, Keaton doesn't
know any better so...

12:08.529 --> 12:10.162
Y'all plannin'
to do Arcadia too?

12:10.164 --> 12:12.297
That is the plan.

12:12.299 --> 12:15.401
- Well, good luck.
- Yeah, I know.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.770
Well, you could always burn some
time while you in those parts

12:18.772 --> 12:21.140
looking for the
Bullitt County treasure.

12:21.808 --> 12:23.240
What's that?

12:23.242 --> 12:24.642
I know it's around
there somewhere.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.577
[mysterious instrumental music]

12:26.579 --> 12:30.415
What? You ain't never heard
the Bullitt County treasure?

12:31.784 --> 12:34.284
Well, here. Get close.

12:34.286 --> 12:37.287
- Alright.
- Listen good.

12:37.289 --> 12:38.722
Not gonna say this
more than once.

12:38.724 --> 12:42.826
- OK.
- Back during prohibition times,

12:42.828 --> 12:46.195
the government was hammering
down all the distilleries,

12:46.197 --> 12:48.564
and the Bullitt family
of Bullitt County

12:48.566 --> 12:49.932
had one of the biggest,

12:49.934 --> 12:51.734
ergo the target on their back.

12:51.736 --> 12:53.602
So the legend goes

12:53.604 --> 12:56.505
that they took all their money
out in the Bullitt County

12:56.507 --> 12:59.275
wilderness and buried it.

13:00.310 --> 13:02.479
Supposedly millions.

13:04.848 --> 13:06.648
And...

13:06.650 --> 13:09.717
- And what?
- That's kind of a short legend.

13:09.719 --> 13:13.253
Well, I don't have the practice
to make it all flowery.

13:13.255 --> 13:14.922
Well, is it true?

13:14.924 --> 13:18.225
Probably not, but from time
to time you do hear about

13:18.227 --> 13:20.627
folks lookin' for it
never to return.

13:20.629 --> 13:23.864
Rumors of the Bullitt family kin
protecting it out in the woods.

13:23.866 --> 13:26.667
- Spooky shit.
- So a bunch of hillbillies

13:26.669 --> 13:29.368
protecting buried
treasure in the woods.

13:29.370 --> 13:32.872
- Hillbillies?!
- I just mean,

13:32.874 --> 13:36.575
- it's Kentucky.
- Oh, it's Kentucky.

13:36.577 --> 13:38.811
- Let me tell you something.
- OK.

13:38.813 --> 13:40.980
All those disappearances
in Bullitt County

13:40.982 --> 13:43.983
were no coincidence, all those
folks were out of towners,

13:43.985 --> 13:46.418
- with fancy shirts.
- Yeah.

13:46.420 --> 13:48.019
We Kentuckians, every

13:48.021 --> 13:49.988
bucktooth country
bumpkin one of us

13:49.990 --> 13:52.322
We're all least smart to say
we've been diggin' up

13:52.324 --> 13:53.694
what ain't ours.

13:57.897 --> 13:59.598
[slow country music]

14:01.367 --> 14:02.900
This

14:02.902 --> 14:04.333
fucking

14:04.335 --> 14:06.369
sucks.

14:06.371 --> 14:08.571
Buried treasure
does not fucking suck.

14:08.573 --> 14:10.540
It fucks up our plans.

14:10.542 --> 14:13.810
- Your plans.
- Yeah, for your bachelor party.

14:13.812 --> 14:16.279
This is what you call
a win-win situation,

14:16.281 --> 14:18.681
we have all our camping
shit right now, right?

14:18.683 --> 14:21.550
We're just gonna be camping a
little bit deeper in the woods.

14:21.552 --> 14:23.819
We have the camping shit
because, remember,

14:23.821 --> 14:27.422
paying for hotels
is what suckers do.

14:27.424 --> 14:28.990
Right.

14:28.992 --> 14:31.927
- Now you're a wine guy I see.
- Oh, well,

14:31.929 --> 14:33.662
you weren't there, but

14:33.664 --> 14:35.731
the wine lady was explaining
to us all these floral

14:35.733 --> 14:38.967
notes that you can taste if you
let them explode in your mouth.

14:38.969 --> 14:40.670
- It's cheaper.
- Bingo.

14:42.839 --> 14:44.338
[soft creepy music]

14:44.340 --> 14:45.740
[they laugh]

14:45.742 --> 14:47.540
- Fuck yeah.
- Dude, they got nothing on me.

14:47.542 --> 14:48.976
Look at those fucking
pussies over there.

14:48.978 --> 14:50.643
They don't know
how to talk to a woman.

14:50.645 --> 14:52.545
C'mon, I know
exactly what to say.

14:52.547 --> 14:54.647
Come on, you gotta
give him a break.

14:54.649 --> 14:55.915
He spelled Gatsby wrong.

14:55.917 --> 14:57.450
[creepy music intensifies]

14:57.452 --> 14:59.386
It's one big red X.

15:00.655 --> 15:02.488
You know when people
look back in their lives

15:02.490 --> 15:03.923
and regret not doing something

15:03.925 --> 15:05.591
that could've
changed their lives,

15:05.593 --> 15:07.528
this is that
crossroads right here.

15:08.462 --> 15:10.397
I, for one, am not
gonna turn into some...

15:11.332 --> 15:13.098
fifty year old blob of shit

15:13.100 --> 15:16.334
who's sitting around in a shitty
house, wearing a shitty robe,

15:16.336 --> 15:19.771
obsessing over the one day
that we could've taken a little

15:19.773 --> 15:21.839
trek off the beaten path and

15:21.841 --> 15:25.777
I don't know, potentially found
Bullitt motherfucking treasure.

15:25.779 --> 15:27.879
Bullitt family treasure?
More like,

15:27.881 --> 15:31.816
- hillbilly butt-hole pleasures.
- Riveting.

15:31.818 --> 15:34.851
- Groom card, I'm playing it.
- Goddammit. Fuck.

15:34.853 --> 15:36.486
There it is.

15:36.488 --> 15:37.754
Tough break, señor Chardonnay.

15:37.756 --> 15:39.422
Now when we do
find the treasure,

15:39.424 --> 15:41.357
what's everybody
gonna do with the loot?

15:41.359 --> 15:43.425
Invest, for the future.

15:43.427 --> 15:45.795
- Hold on, are you serious?
- Nothing, 'cause it's not real.

15:45.797 --> 15:47.763
Hold on, it was a story, Gordie,

15:47.765 --> 15:49.899
no different than
the <i>Great Gatsby.</i>

15:49.901 --> 15:53.002
All stories are based on some
truth, you told me that.

15:53.004 --> 15:54.937
- I never said that.
- Yes, you did.

15:54.939 --> 15:57.006
You came to Keats and my
dorm-room and you were

15:57.008 --> 15:58.640
crying your eyes out.

15:58.642 --> 16:00.508
- I was not crying
- You were bawling.

16:00.510 --> 16:02.044
- I think you were.
- And saying like,

16:02.046 --> 16:04.946
"I don't wanna end up in a
miserable job like my mom,

16:04.948 --> 16:07.549
and she doesn't understand me,
and I got to do it because

16:07.551 --> 16:09.918
- it makes me feel alive.
- OK. I was drunk.

16:09.920 --> 16:13.823
Probably, but then came your
infamous truth speech.

16:14.890 --> 16:16.957
- Truth with a capital T.
- Don't.

16:16.959 --> 16:21.962
Life only has meaning when it
has truth with a capital T!

16:21.964 --> 16:24.064
Then you went on about
that's why you do it,

16:24.066 --> 16:26.465
because it gives you
meaning and closer to that

16:26.467 --> 16:28.101
truth with a capital T.

16:28.103 --> 16:30.603
You said, "all meaningful
stories, no matter how

16:30.605 --> 16:33.406
fantastical or
not real they are,

16:33.408 --> 16:34.841
hold some of those deep truths.

16:34.843 --> 16:36.642
Baby, how's it goin' over here?

16:36.644 --> 16:38.010
I couldn't help but notice ya.

16:38.012 --> 16:40.779
- Oh.
- Mind if I buy you a drink?

16:40.781 --> 16:42.814
- No, I'm cool.
- Let her handle it.

16:42.816 --> 16:45.550
Anything, they got some
killer screwdrivers.

16:45.552 --> 16:47.185
Hey, buddy. She said she's good.

16:47.187 --> 16:48.954
You know,

16:48.956 --> 16:52.556
some chicks don't know how
they are until they've

16:52.558 --> 16:54.792
loosened up a little bit
with some drinks.

16:54.794 --> 16:56.762
Gordie.

16:57.830 --> 17:00.933
Maybe she wasn't clear enough,
so allow me to be clearer.

17:01.834 --> 17:03.870
Fuck off!

17:04.670 --> 17:07.006
You know, it's not
what I heard her say.

17:08.506 --> 17:11.943
I heard her say she might need
a good old Kentucky fuckin'.

17:17.648 --> 17:19.848
[they scuffle]

17:19.851 --> 17:20.849
Hey, Gordie.

17:20.852 --> 17:22.185
[country music intensifies]

17:22.186 --> 17:23.919
I could fucking kill you.

17:23.921 --> 17:26.723
[Keaton] Alright, fine,
let's get some fucking treasure.

17:30.594 --> 17:31.996
Sorry.

17:36.532 --> 17:38.633
[Robin] Asshole.

17:38.635 --> 17:40.036
[country music fades]

17:41.004 --> 17:43.905
- Fucking overreacting hothead.
- I'm overreacting?

17:43.907 --> 17:45.940
You might be cool with
lettin' shit like that slide,

17:45.942 --> 17:47.742
but somebody's gotta
put him in his place.

17:47.744 --> 17:49.176
It's not your place.

17:49.178 --> 17:51.245
If I pulled a knife
every time a guy was a pig

17:51.247 --> 17:52.979
I'd be in fucking prison.

17:52.981 --> 17:54.781
Fucking idiot.

17:54.783 --> 17:58.151
- He was being a piece of shit.
- You're a piece of shit.

17:58.153 --> 17:59.621
OK.

18:00.722 --> 18:03.589
"Hey, baby, you want some
killer screwdrivers?"

18:03.591 --> 18:05.027
And I'm the jack-off.

18:06.861 --> 18:08.694
Should we get out of the street?

18:08.696 --> 18:10.765
We might get hit.

18:13.267 --> 18:15.036
[they laugh]

18:15.870 --> 18:17.939
You fucking dick. Let's go.

18:20.774 --> 18:23.076
[Wayne] You don't really
think this is real, do you?

18:24.711 --> 18:27.879
Really? Bullitt family,
buried treasure?

18:27.881 --> 18:30.714
Well, there are a ton of
"no trespassing" signs

18:30.716 --> 18:33.719
out here in the middle
of nowhere, for a reason.

18:34.687 --> 18:36.254
The reason is, they
don't want trespassers.

18:36.256 --> 18:39.589
Trespassers that might
find their buried treasure.

18:39.591 --> 18:41.526
[Keaton] Hey, guys!

18:42.560 --> 18:43.927
New plan.

18:43.929 --> 18:46.796
I'm not digging
for treasure anymore,

18:46.798 --> 18:48.831
I'm not digging my own grave,

18:48.833 --> 18:54.038
so when I'm done, just
fucking bury me, please!

18:54.939 --> 18:57.139
- Groom card.
- I'm gonna beat you to death

18:57.141 --> 18:59.741
- with this, I swear to God.
- With that?

18:59.743 --> 19:03.144
How much did you save on that
there kitty shovel, Mr. Merlot?

19:03.146 --> 19:05.113
59 cents, bitch.

19:05.115 --> 19:06.650
[Gordie laughs]

19:20.262 --> 19:21.962
Robo,

19:21.964 --> 19:23.665
I'm sorry.

19:26.901 --> 19:29.071
"Sorry's gotta be
backed up by actions."

19:30.705 --> 19:33.141
I know, I'm always apologizing.

19:34.242 --> 19:36.044
I just hope I can...

19:37.312 --> 19:39.047
prove it to you, I guess.

19:40.748 --> 19:42.083
"You're a piece of shit."

19:45.886 --> 19:48.022
Can't argue with you there.

19:48.789 --> 19:52.026
I'm just a revolving door
of fuck ups.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.996
But just know that I am sorry.

19:59.098 --> 20:02.001
I'm really trying to get my
actions to line up with that.

20:07.739 --> 20:09.275
Great talk.

20:10.243 --> 20:14.144
Hang it up, Keats.
We're done for the day.

20:14.146 --> 20:15.747
[fire crackles]

20:26.924 --> 20:30.259
Day three of the botched
treasure hunt debackles '77.

20:30.261 --> 20:32.861
- You throwing in the towel yet?
- Me, I quit.

20:32.863 --> 20:34.829
Yeah, how 'bout you
shut up and light me up,

20:34.831 --> 20:37.168
- Mr. Sauvignon Blanc.
- Yes, sir.

20:39.669 --> 20:42.672
- [all] Ah!
- Yes!

20:43.640 --> 20:45.873
- Do us the honor.
- Really?

20:45.875 --> 20:49.179
- [Robin] Man of the hour.
- Too kind. Alright.

20:55.884 --> 20:59.319
Ne, ne, fu, fu!

20:59.321 --> 21:02.322
- Indians.
- That good?

21:02.324 --> 21:04.193
[Gordie coughs and spits]

21:05.194 --> 21:08.060
Keats, was this buried in your
backpack since high school?

21:08.062 --> 21:11.063
No, I got that last week.
From a guy who knew a guy.

21:11.065 --> 21:12.932
How much did you
pay for this shit?

21:12.934 --> 21:15.800
OK, it can't be that bad.
Here, let me try.

21:15.802 --> 21:17.303
If it tastes
as bad as it smells...

21:17.305 --> 21:19.138
I'm not a cheap skate
with everything,

21:19.140 --> 21:21.673
some things I actually
do spend some money on.

21:21.675 --> 21:23.141
[Robin coughs]

21:23.143 --> 21:24.342
Not a lot, but...

21:24.344 --> 21:25.810
That is some evil shit, Keats.

21:25.812 --> 21:27.212
[Gordie laughs]

21:27.214 --> 21:30.816
- Here, c'mon.
- No, I'm sticking to this.

21:31.984 --> 21:34.019
I'll fall on the grenade.

21:35.221 --> 21:37.955
It's a bunch of stems and seeds,
but it's something.

21:37.957 --> 21:40.290
The dealer says
that's the best part.

21:40.292 --> 21:43.093
- Shut up.
- [Robin] Speaking of which,

21:43.095 --> 21:44.827
do you guys know
what time it is?

21:44.829 --> 21:47.029
- The witching hour?
- It's time for

21:47.031 --> 21:49.098
what's in Keaton's backpack!

21:49.100 --> 21:51.300
- Oh, God.
- The game where I get to raid

21:51.302 --> 21:54.070
the whole of Keats'
backpack from high school.

21:54.072 --> 21:57.240
One grab is all I get to
find out what's left over

21:57.242 --> 21:59.774
from when little Keats was
transitioning from an awkward

21:59.776 --> 22:02.811
boy who isn't getting any,
to an awkward man who still

22:02.813 --> 22:05.182
isn't getting any.

22:06.016 --> 22:09.818
Although the man part is
absolutely debatable.

22:09.820 --> 22:11.486
Alright.

22:11.488 --> 22:14.158
- [Robin] Good luck!
- [Keaton] Keep digging.

22:15.392 --> 22:16.790
[gasps] Oh!

22:16.792 --> 22:17.992
[others all laugh]

22:17.994 --> 22:20.997
You fucker! You set me up!

22:21.797 --> 22:24.265
Do you wanna keep digging?
I think I've got a butt-plug.

22:24.267 --> 22:25.867
God!

22:26.935 --> 22:28.369
On second thought,
I'm keeping this.

22:28.371 --> 22:29.969
No, I have to return it.

22:29.971 --> 22:32.207
Well, I hope you
can return used items.

22:33.375 --> 22:35.008
I oughta shove this up your ass.

22:35.010 --> 22:36.943
It is insecure babies like you

22:36.945 --> 22:39.045
that got Ulysses banned.

22:39.047 --> 22:41.481
- Oh, here we go.
- World War I.

22:41.483 --> 22:44.983
Just wraps up with men
firing dick-shaped rockets

22:44.985 --> 22:47.152
and dick-shaped
bullets. And why?

22:47.154 --> 22:49.188
- Who cares? Oh, God!
- Why?

22:49.190 --> 22:52.524
The assassination of
Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

22:52.526 --> 22:55.059
Death! Dicks!

22:55.061 --> 22:58.996
Violence! The male organ
stabs and penetrates!

22:58.998 --> 23:02.433
And then World War I ends

23:02.435 --> 23:05.203
and James fucking Joyce

23:05.205 --> 23:09.307
unleashes this golden
poem upon the world.

23:09.309 --> 23:12.244
And he has the balls
to finish it

23:13.045 --> 23:16.179
with an orgasm.
Not just any orgasm,

23:16.181 --> 23:18.448
a female orgasm.

23:18.450 --> 23:21.318
- Is there such a thing?
- You wouldn't know.

23:21.320 --> 23:25.921
And he gets fucking banned
by the same jack-offs no doubt

23:25.923 --> 23:29.291
- that supported the war.
- This James Joyce

23:29.293 --> 23:32.328
that you speak so
highly about, is that a..

23:32.330 --> 23:33.996
woman or a man?

23:33.998 --> 23:36.030
- Fuck off!
- Ow!

23:36.032 --> 23:37.366
[they all laugh]

How 'bout this.
OK, man was here first, right?

23:42.839 --> 23:45.373
God took Adam's
sternum or femur,

23:45.375 --> 23:48.476
and the chick, she took
a bite from the apple

23:48.478 --> 23:50.511
in the garden of Eden,
so there's that.

23:50.513 --> 23:52.982
OK. So, fine, but...

23:53.882 --> 23:56.550
Who made her eat the apple?

23:56.552 --> 24:01.156
The snake, right?
What's the snake a metaphor for?

24:02.491 --> 24:03.956
The devil. Greed.

24:03.958 --> 24:05.891
- Temptation?
- Death?

24:05.893 --> 24:08.160
- A cock!

24:08.162 --> 24:09.895
"cocks", you know that?

24:09.897 --> 24:14.267
It's a violent man's world,
we are just livin' in it.

24:14.269 --> 24:17.370
Yeah, well, what about Batman?
He uses violence for good.

24:17.372 --> 24:21.072
Here we go. OK, but Batman
is a shit character.

24:25.279 --> 24:30.181
I'm sorry. The guy's parents
died 20 years ago, get over it!

24:30.183 --> 24:32.350
Let me tell you something,
it depends on the book, for one.

24:32.352 --> 24:34.285
Clearly you don't
know your history, but...

24:34.287 --> 24:38.322
OK, but like, your parents are
dead, move the fuck on.

24:38.324 --> 24:41.158
That's gives him his powers,
his ability to never forgive.

24:41.160 --> 24:42.559
The whole essence of him.

24:42.561 --> 24:45.162
That is a really good way
of putting it.

24:45.164 --> 24:46.996
- It is.
- Another way of putting it is

24:46.998 --> 24:48.532

You're not ready to get married.

28:53.828 --> 28:56.227
I'm not saying anything
you don't really know.

28:56.229 --> 28:58.532

29:00.667 --> 29:02.166

- Believe me...

29:02.168 --> 29:03.268

29:03.270 --> 29:04.702
I know what it's like

29:04.704 --> 29:05.837
to be ready for marriage.

29:05.839 --> 29:08.308
I was more than ready. Then...

29:09.809 --> 29:12.677
Commitment is a pledge
for the future and

29:12.679 --> 29:16.515
you can't commit to anything
if you dwell in the past.

29:19.652 --> 29:22.151
You know, before I headed off
to college and met all you guys

29:22.153 --> 29:25.691
I spent one of those summers
trying to "find myself".

29:28.192 --> 29:30.493
Which is ridiculous because
trying to find yourself

29:30.495 --> 29:33.563
straight out of high school is
like nailing Jell-O to the wall.

29:33.565 --> 29:36.799
There I was,
I saved up some money.

29:36.801 --> 29:40.103
I'm gonna head out to Big Sur
and rough it for a few months.

29:40.805 --> 29:44.139
Yeah, I wanted to see the
Pacific, I'd never seen it.

29:44.141 --> 29:46.841
I'd never seen a state outside
of Indiana for that matter.

29:46.843 --> 29:51.513
So there I am in Big Sur
and the first thing I do is

29:51.515 --> 29:53.447
I just start trudging it
up this mountain,

29:53.449 --> 29:55.182
"I'm gonna get to
the tippy-top"

29:55.184 --> 29:59.153
so I could watch the sun
set over the Pacific and...

29:59.155 --> 30:00.321
Find yourself.

30:00.323 --> 30:03.390
Man, that sounds really stupid.

30:03.392 --> 30:05.726
But at the time,
yeah, of course.

30:05.728 --> 30:08.328
So there I am, I'm hoofing it
up this mountain

30:08.330 --> 30:09.863
and I'm not taking
my eyes off the top.

30:09.865 --> 30:13.299
I'm just going and going.
Watching so I don't fall down.

30:13.301 --> 30:15.468
But I'm not as fast
as the sun setting,

30:15.470 --> 30:17.470
so by the time
I get to the top

30:17.472 --> 30:20.607
it's pitch black. So I turn
around to head back down

30:20.609 --> 30:22.576
and boom! There she is.

30:23.878 --> 30:27.381
The pacific,
she had been at my back...

30:28.482 --> 30:31.950
the entire time.
If I had turned around once,

30:31.952 --> 30:36.320
you know, I would've been able
to see the sun set over her,

30:36.322 --> 30:37.523
but...

30:43.229 --> 30:44.495
You told me that before.

30:44.497 --> 30:45.796
[Gordie laughs]

30:45.798 --> 30:47.734
That's a sad
fucking story, man.

30:52.571 --> 30:55.672
I'm just saying, if I were
in that Gatsby class of yours,

30:55.674 --> 30:57.674
I would've aced
that fuckin' paper.

30:57.676 --> 30:59.709
- Is that right?
- Aced it.

30:59.711 --> 31:02.513
Didn't even take that long to
read, finished it this morning.

31:03.414 --> 31:06.751
And that last line,
God, it stuck with me.

31:08.386 --> 31:12.188

green light of tomorrow."

33:36.456 --> 33:38.656
I guess a little bit of both.

33:38.658 --> 33:40.958

definitely not my thing.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.827
Yeah, I didn't care
too much about

33:42.829 --> 33:45.029
something they just
made up out of thin air.

33:45.031 --> 33:46.664
Hence the history books.

33:46.666 --> 33:49.499
Yeah, well,
they say that history

33:49.501 --> 33:52.704
is written by the victors.

33:53.505 --> 33:55.939
Which is probably
why I'm a gun nut.

who wanted to know.

They saw it as a point of
pride to get to a hundred

from up close

35:32.998 --> 35:36.933
and I saw him go down not
very far in front of me.

35:36.935 --> 35:40.669
I had to know.
I had to look.

35:40.671 --> 35:43.540
So I wandered out
into the dark...

35:44.642 --> 35:46.541
and I saw him lying there

35:46.543 --> 35:49.811
in all the wet ferns and moss,

35:49.813 --> 35:54.051
wide eyed, staring up at
the moon through the trees.

35:54.919 --> 35:57.820

You're way off the beaten path
there, aren't ya?

37:04.549 --> 37:05.616
Maybe so.

37:06.251 --> 37:08.050
But it hasn't been too bad

37:08.052 --> 37:10.186
killin' some time
out there in the woods.

37:10.188 --> 37:13.923
So that's what you
were all doin', killin' time?

37:13.925 --> 37:15.927
[soft tense music]

37:19.130 --> 37:23.598
A lot of people come out here

37:36.245 --> 37:37.811
We're just havin' some fun

37:37.813 --> 37:40.216
for ol' Gordo's bachelor party.

37:41.583 --> 37:44.051
Don't lie to us, young lady,

in here for something to eat.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.922
[Robin nervously laughs]

37:49.758 --> 37:52.358
Alright, we were
looking for the treasure,

37:52.360 --> 37:54.060
but we... You know,

37:54.062 --> 37:56.863
it's just a silly,
stupid thing to do.

37:56.865 --> 37:59.298
Yeah, you're right,
it was a stupid thing to do.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.833
You know, you ain't
the first ones to be

38:01.835 --> 38:04.772
traipsing around
out there in our woods.

38:06.073 --> 38:09.176

not clear enough?

and a shave too, son?

38:46.744 --> 38:48.677
You sure took your time.

His name is Scott. Scott Keaton.

39:36.390 --> 39:38.992
I said, look at me.

I...

would be fine.

You said your name
was Hitchins.

If this were loaded,

40:06.318 --> 40:10.121
you'd be pissin' your bridges
right about now.

40:11.356 --> 40:12.891
Well, I...

40:14.192 --> 40:17.926
I found some bullets
back there so...

40:17.928 --> 40:19.230
Did you now?

40:20.398 --> 40:21.832
Where?

40:23.800 --> 40:26.003
I never keep 'em loaded.

40:28.372 --> 40:31.872
Now if you just give us
back our money,

40:31.874 --> 40:33.343
no one gets hurt.

40:35.811 --> 40:39.115

I never keep 'em loaded.

40:54.529 --> 40:56.965
Except this one apparently.

40:59.501 --> 41:01.436
Hey, Keats.
How about you grab that gun?

41:07.107 --> 41:09.343
You better think about
what you're doin', kid.

41:12.079 --> 41:14.113
That soldier you killed...

41:15.382 --> 41:18.117
- What was his name?
- I don't know.

41:19.819 --> 41:21.120
I think you do know.

41:22.388 --> 41:23.820
You checked.

Ah, there it is. Now...

What's your name?

41:41.440 --> 41:43.272
Hitchins.

41:43.274 --> 41:46.744
Doesn't sound like that in the
little sign in the bathroom.

what's your name?

You sick son of a bitch!

[Gordie] He pointed a gun
right at Keats.

42:39.860 --> 42:41.560
[Robin] It wasn't loaded!

42:41.562 --> 42:44.429
[Gordie] He went for the rifle,
that sure as fuck was loaded,

no one threatens my friends,</i>

43:17.529 --> 43:20.532
You know exactly what
we have to do right now.

43:22.099 --> 43:24.232
Yeah. I know.

43:24.234 --> 43:27.536
You know I'm right.
She's gonna go to the cops,

43:27.538 --> 43:29.304
and she's gonna come
after us herself.

43:29.306 --> 43:31.540
She knows our fucking
full names, Robin.

43:31.542 --> 43:34.543
Do you want to spend your whole
life waitin' for some old lady

43:34.545 --> 43:36.410
- to come after you?
- Shut up! She's a scared

43:36.412 --> 43:40.047
little lady,
she didn't ask for this.

43:40.049 --> 43:41.515
Shut up!

43:41.517 --> 43:43.317
They came out into
the woods after us,

43:43.319 --> 43:45.419
we were minding our
own fucking business.

43:45.421 --> 43:47.321
- It's their property.
- They could've asked us

43:47.323 --> 43:49.189
to leave and we would've,
but they didn't.

43:49.191 --> 43:51.024
They lured us back
to their fucking house.

43:51.026 --> 43:52.559
Where is she?

43:52.561 --> 43:54.361
- Oh, God!
- Shh!

- Is she dead?
- No.

43:59.201 --> 44:00.602
[Robing cries]

44:14.948 --> 44:16.482
This is absurd.

the balance of a short straw.

44:22.455 --> 44:26.659
- Fair is fair, right?
- She's not gonna do it.

44:27.460 --> 44:29.228
I wouldn't neither
if I were her.

44:34.533 --> 44:38.335
I'll clean up the mess, but
what she does, is her choice,

44:38.337 --> 44:42.506
turn us in,
stalk us, nothing...

44:42.508 --> 44:44.643
it's not our place
to kill her.

44:46.511 --> 44:48.477
She'll squeal.

44:48.479 --> 44:50.615
- That's what I'd do.
- Not everyone's you.

44:52.216 --> 44:53.749
Wouldn't blame her if she did.

44:53.751 --> 44:55.653
It'd be the right thing to do.

45:01.625 --> 45:02.692
Right.

45:23.345 --> 45:24.713
I'll do it.

45:36.558 --> 45:38.660
Neither one of you
can look me in the eye.

45:40.194 --> 45:42.396
I think that's the least
that you could do.

45:46.133 --> 45:47.468
[eerie music]

45:48.635 --> 45:50.802
Would you have
pulled the trigger?

45:50.804 --> 45:52.539
[Keaton] It wasn't loaded.

45:54.741 --> 45:56.275
But if it was?

46:01.747 --> 46:04.249
It takes two things
to kill somebody.

46:05.283 --> 46:07.620
Bullets and balls.

46:10.255 --> 46:11.523
[Wayne] What have we done?

46:12.390 --> 46:14.159
It was them or us.

46:18.295 --> 46:21.499
[Keaton] I'll go grab
a mop or something.

46:22.767 --> 46:24.235
Leave no trace.

46:25.469 --> 46:27.538
Yeah, we'll leave no trace.

- [Robin] <i>I'm sorry.</i>
- [wife] <i>Don't apologize</i>

46:33.544 --> 46:35.209
<i>before you kill somebody.</i>

46:35.211 --> 46:36.712
[Robin] About your husband.

46:36.714 --> 46:39.182
Don't apologize for
that boy out there neither.

to do a man's job.

46:42.719 --> 46:44.454
[eerie music]

46:45.755 --> 46:47.322
I drew short straw.

46:48.257 --> 46:50.225
Then do what you came
in here to do.

47:04.438 --> 47:06.307
- Do you think...
- Quit stalling.

47:11.245 --> 47:12.813
Listen, when
I first came here...

47:14.615 --> 47:16.749
I was even younger
than you are now

47:16.751 --> 47:19.352
and I didn't know the
first thing about chickens.

47:20.888 --> 47:23.521
They were just a bunch of dumb
birds as far as I was concerned,

47:23.523 --> 47:26.424
but I filled this coop up
with hens,

47:26.426 --> 47:28.662
and then I got
myself one rooster.

47:30.630 --> 47:33.797
Before you knew it he had pecked
two of those hens to death

47:33.799 --> 47:36.366
and scared the living hell
out of all the rest of them,

47:36.368 --> 47:38.270
so they quit laying their eggs.

47:39.405 --> 47:42.238
All that took was one rooster,

47:42.240 --> 47:44.777
and so I shot that rooster.

47:45.844 --> 47:48.746
I didn't see any reason
to do otherwise.

47:52.183 --> 47:54.383
You don't always have
to shoot the rooster.

48:21.677 --> 48:23.746
- Do you need any...
- I'm gonna bury her.

48:25.681 --> 48:27.682
I can do it if you want me to.

48:29.551 --> 48:31.820
I made the mess, Keat.
I'll clean it up.

48:40.795 --> 48:43.564
[dramatic rumble]

48:53.439 --> 48:55.441
[soft eerie music continues]

49:31.241 --> 49:32.741
You all done?

49:32.743 --> 49:34.845
- Yeah.
- Come with me.

49:41.484 --> 49:42.619
Do you see him?

49:45.922 --> 49:46.856
Nope.

49:48.892 --> 49:49.893
Good.

49:52.895 --> 49:54.363
Where is he?

50:02.470 --> 50:03.906
He was gonna shoot you, Keats.

50:28.595 --> 50:31.430
- That was fast.
- Little old lady.

50:32.698 --> 50:34.298
[Robin] Let's get out of here.

50:34.300 --> 50:35.835

[Keaton] You comin'?

50:38.904 --> 50:40.405
Yeah.

50:53.317 --> 50:57.421
This is wrong, we can't just
pretend none of this happened.

50:59.623 --> 51:01.625
It's not something we can erase.

51:02.826 --> 51:04.795
This will always follow us.

51:06.530 --> 51:08.532
I had no choice.

51:12.568 --> 51:13.937
Right?

51:16.372 --> 51:18.674
Yeah, right.

51:23.579 --> 51:25.547
You always have a choice.

51:26.448 --> 51:29.449
This right here,
this is a bad one.

51:29.451 --> 51:31.620
[eerie music continues]

find him this way, Robin.

52:38.682 --> 52:40.815
You should get rid of it.

52:40.817 --> 52:42.819
I should get rid of
a lot of things.

52:44.788 --> 52:47.421
Is that some sort of threat?

52:47.423 --> 52:48.959
The pocket watch.

52:49.893 --> 52:51.725
I thought you said it was,
"beyond repair".

52:51.727 --> 52:54.096
I said it, "might
be beyond repair".

52:55.097 --> 52:58.734
I'll keep noodling with it.
See if anything shakes loose.

52:59.935 --> 53:01.569
You gonna drink that?

53:03.172 --> 53:05.438
Yes.

53:05.440 --> 53:07.506
Yes, I am.

53:07.508 --> 53:08.776
It's been ten years.

53:11.112 --> 53:13.679
There was a guy at a meeting
once that said he kept

53:13.681 --> 53:18.086
a vodka shooter in his pocket
to remind him of his weakness.

53:19.853 --> 53:21.586
I mean, that's all
those meetings were,

53:21.588 --> 53:23.824
reminders of my weakness...

53:26.793 --> 53:29.460
for then fucking years.

53:29.462 --> 53:32.563
That's all I did.
I just wallowed in it.

53:32.565 --> 53:34.867
I wallowed in my weakness.

53:36.035 --> 53:37.701
Banding together
in common weakness

53:37.703 --> 53:39.770
is what creates strength.

53:39.772 --> 53:42.206
It's the only way to deal with
all the horrors in this world.

53:42.208 --> 53:45.477
It's why people get married,
and form friendships

53:46.511 --> 53:48.678
and reunite to relive
the good old days.

53:48.680 --> 53:50.749
[tense music intensifies]

53:57.755 --> 53:59.755
[tense music fades]

53:59.757 --> 54:01.892
[eerie music]

54:04.161 --> 54:06.597
He's probably scared.
It's gonna get dark soon.

54:07.197 --> 54:09.965
- One hour.
- One hour, that's it.

54:09.967 --> 54:11.900
Either way,
if we find him or not.

54:11.902 --> 54:15.038
- You got it. Promise. One hour.
- Be careful.

54:15.972 --> 54:18.940
Yeah, you too.
I'll see you in an hour.

54:18.942 --> 54:21.744
[eerie music fades]

54:31.653 --> 54:33.922
[Soft instrumental music]

54:41.662 --> 54:42.928
[soft instrumental music fades]

54:42.930 --> 54:44.997
[man] Got it all
down there, Gordie?

54:44.999 --> 54:47.933
I sure did. Thanks, Mr. Jay.

54:47.935 --> 54:50.102
Yeah, I'll see you
next time you're around.

54:50.104 --> 54:52.805
Will do, alright. Take care.

54:52.807 --> 54:54.774
[radio in the background]

54:57.077 --> 55:00.013
- Look at you two ding dongs.
- Gordon!

55:00.814 --> 55:02.880
Watch that.

55:02.882 --> 55:04.884
Hey, Santi Clause.

55:06.052 --> 55:08.752
- I gotta deliver presents.
- Yeah, here we go.

55:08.754 --> 55:10.090
- [Robin laughs]
- Here we go.

55:12.157 --> 55:15.092
- [Gordie] Arcadia.
- We're gonna find it one day.

55:15.094 --> 55:19.562
Nope, I don't think it exists.
It's like fuckin' Sasquatch.

55:19.564 --> 55:24.033
Don't you talk about Sasquatch
like that, he's very real.

55:24.035 --> 55:28.137
I don't think so, but it did
give us a very great excuse

55:28.139 --> 55:33.109
to come right back
to the Red River.

55:33.111 --> 55:35.710
I think that the owner's
gonna put you in his will.

55:35.712 --> 55:38.713
You know what? He probably will.

55:38.715 --> 55:39.881
- [Robin laughs]
- But, hey.

55:39.883 --> 55:41.983
- [Robin] Yeah.
- Shh.

55:41.985 --> 55:43.952
- I hate their bourbon.
- What?

55:43.954 --> 55:46.988
- You're fucking with me.
- Nope, I kinda hate it.

55:46.990 --> 55:50.258
- It tastes like gas.
- I thought it was your favorite.

55:50.260 --> 55:53.794
No, not the bourbon,
the distillery, dummy.

55:53.796 --> 55:54.930
[Robin chuckles]

55:55.965 --> 55:58.134
With their [indistinct]
and little Carolyn...

55:59.268 --> 56:01.734
it feels like home.
I feel at peace here,

56:01.736 --> 56:05.305
more so than anywhere
else on the planet, really.

56:05.307 --> 56:07.274
Yeah.

56:07.276 --> 56:09.776
Are you glad you bought
that piece of shit

56:09.778 --> 56:11.744
at a shitty ass yard sale?

56:11.746 --> 56:14.881
It works when it's supposed to
'cause look what just came

56:14.883 --> 56:16.349
hot off the presses.

56:16.351 --> 56:19.618
- [Gordie] Oh!
- [Keaton] Your new bride to be!

56:19.620 --> 56:22.287
That turned out...
You took a good picture.

56:22.289 --> 56:24.890
Yeah, some of them don't turn
out all blurry and fucked up.

56:24.892 --> 56:26.391
You know what I
hope that happens?

56:26.393 --> 56:28.626
- Can I be best man one day?
- Yeah, why not.

56:28.628 --> 56:33.231
I hope that thing crabs out on
you right when we find Arcadia.

56:33.233 --> 56:35.333
Like those people who's
cameras don't work

56:35.335 --> 56:37.234
- when they find Sasquatch!
- Blah, blah.

56:37.236 --> 56:40.137
Uh-oh, Robo's got
Sasquatch on the brain.

56:40.139 --> 56:42.806
[Keaton] Yeah, how could you not
with hairy legs like that.

56:42.808 --> 56:44.841
Don't even try it, I already

56:44.843 --> 56:46.776
called shotgun,
you big dumb dildo.

56:46.778 --> 56:49.380
[Keaton] I wasn't even...
You know, I don't give a fuck.

56:49.382 --> 56:51.881
- Don't give a fuck!
- [Gordie] Shh.

56:51.883 --> 56:54.050
- Gordie, I don't give a fuck!
- Shut up.

56:54.052 --> 56:55.385
[Keaton laughs]

56:55.387 --> 56:57.886
- Shut up. Ow.
- [Robin] Can't do it.

56:57.888 --> 57:00.225
Hey, is this window open?
I got an idea.

57:01.692 --> 57:02.958
Yeah.

57:02.960 --> 57:06.195
[Gordie] Robo, wait.
Woah, wait.

57:06.197 --> 57:09.233
I'm just full of great ideas,
Red River. I'm full of 'em.

57:10.267 --> 57:13.068
- [Gordie] Alright, here we go.
- [Robin] No.

57:13.070 --> 57:15.239
Robo you gotta get up. C'mon.

57:16.340 --> 57:20.374
[Gordie] You gotta help.
Watch your head. Just sit.

57:20.376 --> 57:21.776
[car horn beeps]

57:21.778 --> 57:23.279
[Keaton] That was
not a good idea.

57:25.881 --> 57:26.947
You OK?

57:26.949 --> 57:28.349
Mmm.

57:28.351 --> 57:30.052
OK, here we go.

57:43.764 --> 57:45.331
Do you have my Santa hat?

57:45.333 --> 57:47.969
[Christmas song plays
on car radio]

58:03.116 --> 58:04.384
C'mon, Gordo.

58:08.054 --> 58:09.989
Stay awake.

58:19.764 --> 58:20.998
[car crashes and tires squeak]

58:21.000 --> 58:22.301
[car horn beeps]

58:33.945 --> 58:35.911
[Robin] <i>Gordie?!</i>

58:35.913 --> 58:37.280
[soft music]

58:37.282 --> 58:38.416
Gordie!

58:40.284 --> 58:41.418
Gordie!

58:45.022 --> 58:46.924
Goddammit.

58:49.759 --> 58:51.160
Gordie!

58:54.964 --> 58:56.265
Gordie!

58:58.901 --> 59:00.702
In the flesh.

59:02.238 --> 59:04.904
You look lost, Robo.

59:04.906 --> 59:06.139
Lookin' for you.

59:06.141 --> 59:07.106
[Gordie chuckles]

59:07.108 --> 59:08.509
[Robin] C'mon.

59:08.511 --> 59:11.311
Hey, before we go,
let's have a little

59:11.313 --> 59:13.446
- pow-wow on the log here.
- We don't have time for this.

59:13.448 --> 59:15.548
We have to get back
to the car to get our stuff.

59:15.550 --> 59:17.783
Robo, I got a lot
to tell you, c'mon.

59:17.785 --> 59:21.088
- Gordie, tell me at the car.
- Sit on the fucking log!

59:30.364 --> 59:34.466
OK, look at that, that wasn't
so fucking hard. Good, OK.

59:34.468 --> 59:38.369
Now we're cookin' with gas.
Now, there's a lot I gotta say

59:38.371 --> 59:40.037
I guess I won't
beat around the bush,

59:40.039 --> 59:42.540
I'll just come out and say it.

59:42.542 --> 59:44.444
So here we go.

59:47.413 --> 59:49.913
I didn't mean to grab
your boob the other night.

59:49.915 --> 59:54.818
It was a stupid, idiotic, mean,
bullshit, Gordie thing to do,

59:54.820 --> 59:57.320
and I know I upset you.

59:57.322 --> 01:00:00.290
You know me, I would
never hurt a friend.

01:00:00.292 --> 01:00:04.061
I would never do anything to
hurt you, right? You understand?

01:00:06.264 --> 01:00:08.230
- Right, Robin?
- Yeah, of course, Gordie.

01:00:08.232 --> 01:00:10.599
[Gordie] "Of course, Gordie!"
There it is.

01:00:10.601 --> 01:00:15.138
'Cause as you can see,
I don't have many friends.

01:00:17.508 --> 01:00:20.975
As illustrated so well by
the incredible turnout

01:00:20.977 --> 01:00:22.377
of my bachelor party!

01:00:22.379 --> 01:00:24.381
Wheow!

01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:31.120
But then there's the friends
I do have, they mean a lot.

01:00:32.087 --> 01:00:36.525
There's one thing I won't do,
is I won't hurt my friends.

01:00:37.559 --> 01:00:40.193
But I hurt you the other night
when we were sitting around...

01:00:40.195 --> 01:00:41.994
I don't give a fuck
that you grabbed my tit.

01:00:41.996 --> 01:00:44.196
- I give a fuck!
- Gordie.

01:00:44.198 --> 01:00:45.565
- We just...
- I am the one who gives a fuck!

01:00:45.567 --> 01:00:48.267
- I don't give a fuck!
- I fucking care!

01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:52.371
I'm the one who only fucking
cares every fucking time!

01:00:52.373 --> 01:00:54.509
I care and you know why I care?

01:01:01.648 --> 01:01:03.216
It's because I love you.

01:01:04.985 --> 01:01:06.453
I always have.

01:01:09.423 --> 01:01:11.591
As a friend.

01:01:12.925 --> 01:01:14.427
But as...

01:01:16.028 --> 01:01:18.064
as a friend...

01:01:20.032 --> 01:01:21.467
a friend I treasure.

01:01:28.106 --> 01:01:31.176
- I treasure you too, Gordie.
- Mmm.

01:01:49.959 --> 01:01:51.294
[creepy music]

01:01:52.629 --> 01:01:54.430
I got it.

01:01:55.331 --> 01:01:57.867
You can grab my boob right now.

01:01:59.235 --> 01:02:00.536
Tit for tat.

01:02:02.472 --> 01:02:06.106
Come on, I grabbed your tit,
you grabbed Keaton's,

01:02:06.108 --> 01:02:08.676
now grab mine,
a good old D.H Lawrence.

01:02:08.678 --> 01:02:11.044
There's really something
fucking wrong with you.

01:02:11.046 --> 01:02:14.280
Woah, don't get up.
Sit down.

01:02:14.282 --> 01:02:18.250
What? It's OK if Keats does it?

01:02:18.252 --> 01:02:21.588
It's fucking so funny
when Keaton does it,

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:24.392
but not Gordie,
I don't let Gordie do it.

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:29.330
What else have you two
been up to?

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.031
I know.

01:02:34.033 --> 01:02:36.403
[whispering] When you
think everyone's asleep.

01:02:38.138 --> 01:02:41.739
Is that it? You go up and
you live it up in Chai town?

01:02:41.741 --> 01:02:45.276
And you come back for who?
Not Gordie, never for Gordie.

01:02:45.278 --> 01:02:47.144
You come back for
your fuck buddy?

01:02:47.146 --> 01:02:48.681
- You're seeing things.
- Yeah.

01:02:50.182 --> 01:02:52.215
A lot clearer now.

01:02:52.217 --> 01:02:54.184
I just need you
to know something,

01:02:54.186 --> 01:02:55.953
look at me.

01:02:57.054 --> 01:02:58.122
Robin...

01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:02.561
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

01:03:04.629 --> 01:03:07.596
Never, ever.

01:03:07.598 --> 01:03:10.032
Never, ever

01:03:10.034 --> 01:03:12.637
do anything to hurt you.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.708
[Gordie grunts]

01:03:19.209 --> 01:03:20.710
Ten years, man.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.282
Ten fucking years.

01:03:27.717 --> 01:03:29.517
I thought you were
better than this.

01:03:29.519 --> 01:03:32.119
That's a sad fuckin' story.

01:03:32.121 --> 01:03:33.589
[Gordie laughs]

01:03:40.161 --> 01:03:42.161
[Robin] Find your own way back.

01:03:42.163 --> 01:03:43.666
I sure will!

01:03:45.467 --> 01:03:47.535
Meet ya at the car, Robo!

01:03:48.369 --> 01:03:50.303
[ominous music]

01:03:50.305 --> 01:03:52.407
[Gordie laughs]

01:03:53.575 --> 01:03:56.444
[Gordie's laugh echoes]

01:04:06.653 --> 01:04:09.621
Hey, guys.

01:04:09.623 --> 01:04:10.757
New plan.

01:04:11.758 --> 01:04:14.692
I'm not digging for
treasure anymore.

01:04:14.694 --> 01:04:16.660
I'm not digging my own grave.

01:04:16.662 --> 01:04:21.632
So, when I'm done just
fucking bury me, please!

01:04:21.634 --> 01:04:23.400
- Groom card.
- I'm gonna beat you

01:04:23.402 --> 01:04:24.835
to death with this, man.
I swear to God.

01:04:24.837 --> 01:04:27.070
- I will beat you to dea...
- With that?

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:30.206
How much did you save on that
there kitty shovel, Mr. Merlot.

01:04:30.208 --> 01:04:31.610
59 cents...

01:04:32.644 --> 01:04:33.778
bitch

01:04:37.381 --> 01:04:38.650
Robin, I'm sorry.

01:04:39.584 --> 01:04:42.286
[soft instrumental music]

01:05:00.303 --> 01:05:02.272
Alright, Keats.
Hang it up.

01:05:03.171 --> 01:05:04.339
Yeah.

01:05:06.275 --> 01:05:08.076
We're done for the day.

01:05:11.313 --> 01:05:13.448
[tense music]

01:05:32.132 --> 01:05:33.634
Fucking Keaton.

01:05:36.570 --> 01:05:38.471
[Keaton] Robin!

01:05:39.406 --> 01:05:41.372
- Leave no trace.
- No trace.

01:05:41.374 --> 01:05:43.343
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:05:50.416 --> 01:05:51.550
Oh.

01:05:52.384 --> 01:05:54.486
Hey there, guys.

01:05:55.387 --> 01:05:57.121
That oughta do it.

01:05:58.189 --> 01:06:01.092
Thought you guys were
gonna leave without me,

01:06:01.694 --> 01:06:04.562
let me fend for myself,
just like you did last time.

01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:06.930
This isn't anything
like last time.

01:06:06.932 --> 01:06:08.598
Ah, no.

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.199
I think it's almost
exactly like last time.

01:06:11.201 --> 01:06:12.635
Just like last time,

01:06:12.637 --> 01:06:15.337
I seemed to be the only one
who gives a shit.

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:17.539
The past has a funny way of

01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:19.541
repeating itself

01:06:19.543 --> 01:06:21.676
over and over again.

01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:23.812
- What the fuck is that, Gordie?
- Oh, yeah.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:26.581
Except I loaded it this time.

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:28.683
Bullets and balls.

01:06:28.685 --> 01:06:30.384
- You told us to leave no trace.
- Gordie?

01:06:30.386 --> 01:06:32.453
- What the fuck are you doing?
- That's impossible.

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:34.922
- We all know that's impossible.
- There's no such thing as

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.690
leave no trace.

01:06:36.692 --> 01:06:38.826
There's always a trace.

01:06:38.828 --> 01:06:41.227
Always a trace.

01:06:41.229 --> 01:06:44.132
- He's been drinking Red X.
- Always a trace.

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:46.366
[Gordie] Ugh.

01:06:46.368 --> 01:06:47.767
Uh-oh.

01:06:47.769 --> 01:06:50.336
I've seen this look before.

01:06:50.338 --> 01:06:51.906
The "Gordie's lost it" look.

01:06:54.241 --> 01:06:55.644
Well, haven't you?

01:06:57.311 --> 01:06:59.513
I don't think you've
seen me lose it, Robin.

01:07:00.949 --> 01:07:02.280
At least not yet.

01:07:02.282 --> 01:07:03.649
- [Robin gasps]
- Hey.

01:07:03.651 --> 01:07:05.717
- [Wayne] No, you don't.
- Why shouldn't I?

01:07:05.719 --> 01:07:07.719
- You're not that person.
- I've already killed two,

01:07:07.721 --> 01:07:09.988
- what's one more?
- [Keaton] What happened to you?

01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:11.589
Put the fucking gun down.

01:07:11.591 --> 01:07:14.859
I had a bit of a spill
back there, hurt my head

01:07:14.861 --> 01:07:18.329
real bad.
It's got me seeing double.

01:07:18.331 --> 01:07:19.597
[Gordie laughs]

01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:20.900
Just put the fuckin' gun down.

01:07:26.773 --> 01:07:28.973
[tense music intensifies]

01:07:28.975 --> 01:07:30.642
Anyways.

01:07:32.477 --> 01:07:34.243
[tense music fades]

01:07:34.245 --> 01:07:35.179
Shotgun.

01:07:36.682 --> 01:07:38.684
Where are ya?
There you are, little buddy.

01:07:42.253 --> 01:07:44.522
[Keaton] Let's just get
the fuck outta here.

01:07:55.432 --> 01:07:57.532
Hm, hm, hm.

01:07:57.534 --> 01:07:58.835
[Gordie burps]

01:08:13.348 --> 01:08:15.584
[eerie music]

01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:23.591
Open the backpack.

01:08:24.459 --> 01:08:26.992
- What's that?
- Do it.

01:08:26.993 --> 01:08:28.696
[Tense music]

01:08:33.667 --> 01:08:36.636
- Just get out of here, Gordie.
- Shut up.

01:08:38.404 --> 01:08:39.840
We all just wanna go home.

01:08:53.352 --> 01:08:54.854
Open it up, Keats.

01:09:07.031 --> 01:09:09.501
Did you have this
at the Bullitt house?

01:09:13.004 --> 01:09:14.571
No.

01:09:17.707 --> 01:09:21.042
I killed a man because
he accused my friend

01:09:21.044 --> 01:09:22.712
of stealin' his money.

01:09:25.448 --> 01:09:28.381
Didn't make a difference
whether we had the money or not,

01:09:28.384 --> 01:09:32.755
they thought we did
without any proof or anything.

01:09:35.390 --> 01:09:36.626
You saw him, Gordie.

01:09:37.627 --> 01:09:39.729
You saw him,
he went for that rifle,

01:09:40.696 --> 01:09:42.799
but you got to it first.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.301
Remember what you said to me
on the porch?

01:09:46.868 --> 01:09:48.636
He was gonna shoot me.

01:09:52.741 --> 01:09:54.042
You saved my life.

01:09:55.043 --> 01:09:56.575
You saved me.

01:09:56.577 --> 01:09:58.612
- He was gonna kill me.
- I killed him.

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:00.980
Yeah.

01:10:00.982 --> 01:10:03.350
Don't you get it?
The legend was real.

01:10:04.819 --> 01:10:06.952
The legend was real.

01:10:06.954 --> 01:10:09.957
It was real, I can't
fucking believe it myself.

01:10:11.591 --> 01:10:14.425
But what was it
you said at the bar

01:10:14.427 --> 01:10:16.060
about being at a crossroads?

01:10:16.062 --> 01:10:18.095
You wanted to come
out in the woods

01:10:18.097 --> 01:10:20.698
and look for buried treasure,
well here you go,

01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:22.934
buried fucking treasure.
This right here,

01:10:22.936 --> 01:10:25.071
- this is truth with a capital T.
- [Robin] Stop.

01:10:25.839 --> 01:10:27.573
Keaton, just stop.

01:10:30.176 --> 01:10:31.610
This is a lie.

01:10:32.678 --> 01:10:34.110
This is all a fucking lie,
you lied to them.

01:10:34.112 --> 01:10:35.679
- You had it the whole time,
- No.

01:10:35.681 --> 01:10:36.880
and then you lied to us.

01:10:36.882 --> 01:10:38.681
I was going to tell you guys,

01:10:38.683 --> 01:10:41.750
of course I was gonna tell you,
'cause it's our money.

01:10:41.752 --> 01:10:45.754
We found it together for
Gordie's bachelor party.

01:10:45.756 --> 01:10:47.024
Together.

01:10:48.025 --> 01:10:49.359
Huh?

01:10:51.929 --> 01:10:54.429
Yeah, and then sick shooter blew
the guy's fuckin' head off,

01:10:54.431 --> 01:10:57.801
- then everything went to shit.
- What's one more exploding head?

01:10:59.603 --> 01:11:03.204
You know what? Robin, you've
got blood on your hands too,

01:11:03.206 --> 01:11:04.774
both of you. I didn't...

01:11:05.842 --> 01:11:07.608
kill anybody.

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:10.046
- I didn't kill anybody.
- You left me alone out there.

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:12.648
You left me alone with him.

01:11:15.517 --> 01:11:18.087
Well, that's not really bein'
alone out there now, is it?

01:11:20.788 --> 01:11:22.457
You know who was alone?

01:11:24.993 --> 01:11:26.394
Me.

01:11:27.528 --> 01:11:29.528
Ten years ago,

01:11:29.530 --> 01:11:31.864
you remember that?

01:11:31.866 --> 01:11:34.666
[eerie music]

01:11:34.668 --> 01:11:36.534
I'm driving.

01:11:36.536 --> 01:11:38.870
You gotta get the car
to work first, chum.

01:11:38.872 --> 01:11:40.672
Robin, you got the keys?

01:11:40.674 --> 01:11:43.942
I don't think you know how
automobiles work, dumbass.

01:11:43.944 --> 01:11:46.543
So what do you wanna do, Gordie?
You just wanna go camping?

01:11:46.545 --> 01:11:48.545
- Come share a bottle and all?
- Yeah, sounds great.

01:11:48.547 --> 01:11:50.848
I dunno if you can tell from
what I'm wearing, something

01:11:50.850 --> 01:11:52.549
did fuckin' happen right here.

01:11:52.551 --> 01:11:54.551
- It looks great.
- Yeah, it was a good time.

01:11:54.553 --> 01:11:58.656
You know, Gordie, you were never
the same since that night.

01:11:58.658 --> 01:11:59.959
Oh, yeah?

01:12:02.962 --> 01:12:04.163
I mean, there were

01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:06.431
glimpses of you,

01:12:06.998 --> 01:12:08.833
the old you here
and there, but...

01:12:10.235 --> 01:12:11.970
it changed you.

01:12:12.904 --> 01:12:14.806
Tell me more, professor.

01:12:18.575 --> 01:12:20.044
[soft tense music]

01:12:21.979 --> 01:12:23.814
You know, some people...

01:12:24.982 --> 01:12:27.718
can dig themselves
out of their holes.

01:12:28.852 --> 01:12:30.986
Not Gordie Solomon.

01:12:30.988 --> 01:12:32.989
You know I have a gun, right?

01:12:34.123 --> 01:12:35.792
Huh?

01:12:38.861 --> 01:12:40.261
[whispers gun sound]

01:12:40.263 --> 01:12:42.832
You tell yourself
you're such a loyal,

01:12:43.799 --> 01:12:46.300
caring, selfless friend.

01:12:46.302 --> 01:12:47.869
What a guy.

01:12:49.871 --> 01:12:51.840
So you don't have to face
what you really are.

01:12:53.909 --> 01:12:55.210
And what's that?

01:12:59.547 --> 01:13:00.481
A Pisces?

01:13:01.649 --> 01:13:02.950
You're nothing.

01:13:03.951 --> 01:13:05.184
[tense music intensifies]

01:13:05.186 --> 01:13:06.185
[Gordie screams]

01:13:06.187 --> 01:13:07.052
[gun shots]

01:13:07.054 --> 01:13:08.020
[guitar strings snap]

01:13:08.022 --> 01:13:09.522
You motherfuckers!

01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:12.324
[tense music fades]

01:13:12.326 --> 01:13:13.760
[Gordie coughs]

01:13:14.861 --> 01:13:16.162
[Gordie spits]

01:13:20.033 --> 01:13:22.632
[someone hums]

01:13:22.634 --> 01:13:24.170
[soft eerie music]

01:13:38.317 --> 01:13:40.317
[Gordie continues
to cough and spit]

01:13:40.319 --> 01:13:42.787
[Wayne hums the
Irish song]

01:13:52.096 --> 01:13:53.930
You almost hit me.

01:13:56.167 --> 01:13:59.002
I can't believe she
pepper sprayed me.

01:14:00.637 --> 01:14:04.607
Well, you did point a gun at her
while threatening to shoot her.

01:14:05.741 --> 01:14:08.011
[Gordie breaths loudly]

01:14:20.056 --> 01:14:21.956
People listen better this way.

01:14:26.027 --> 01:14:27.126
[eerie music]

01:14:27.128 --> 01:14:28.830
Or they pepper spray you.

01:14:29.864 --> 01:14:31.132
OK.

01:14:31.966 --> 01:14:33.834
OK. Good point, yeah.

01:14:45.045 --> 01:14:47.081
I got all I need anyways.

01:14:49.982 --> 01:14:51.249
Toodle-oo.

01:14:51.251 --> 01:14:53.052
[dramatic music]

01:15:11.103 --> 01:15:12.871
[Keaton grunts]

[Keaton shrieks]

01:15:19.677 --> 01:15:21.145
You still with me?

01:15:22.279 --> 01:15:23.781
Not giving up on our friends.

01:15:24.348 --> 01:15:27.416
I've ruined my life on account
of my so-called friends.

01:15:27.418 --> 01:15:31.053
They get to move on,
do whatever the hell they want.

01:15:31.055 --> 01:15:32.356
What do I get?

01:15:43.166 --> 01:15:45.667
[Keaton shrieks and moans]

01:15:53.208 --> 01:15:55.310

[tense music fades]

01:16:24.471 --> 01:16:27.673
You do realize he just walked
by a second ago, right?

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:31.110
He's lost.

01:16:33.078 --> 01:16:35.314
And so are you,
you selfish asshole.

01:16:36.282 --> 01:16:37.381
Yeah.

01:16:37.383 --> 01:16:38.948
Well...

01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:41.220
That's OK, I think Karma got me.

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.254
Jesus, Keaton.

01:16:44.490 --> 01:16:47.225
I'm not a doctor
or anything, but...

01:16:48.159 --> 01:16:50.094
I think it's a
femoral artery thing.

01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:54.096
OK, we gotta get you outta here.

01:16:54.098 --> 01:16:57.335
I'm not exactly out here
for the view.

01:16:58.536 --> 01:17:00.335
It's not so bad actually.

01:17:00.337 --> 01:17:02.070
Alright, I'm gonna go get help.

01:17:02.072 --> 01:17:03.805
OK? It just might
take me a while.

01:17:03.807 --> 01:17:06.141
No, what are you,
a big bad hunter now?

01:17:06.143 --> 01:17:07.775
- He's not in his right mind.
- Yeah, I know.

01:17:07.777 --> 01:17:10.246
That's when you need
to keep the fucking gun.

01:17:16.385 --> 01:17:18.452
[Keaton]
We lost him, didn't we?

01:17:18.454 --> 01:17:20.887
[Robin] I think it was just
a matter of time.

01:17:20.889 --> 01:17:22.991
[soft instrumental music]

01:17:24.159 --> 01:17:26.859
Look at me. Two bullets.

01:17:26.861 --> 01:17:28.861
No, you keep the gun.

01:17:28.863 --> 01:17:30.230
When I get back,

01:17:30.232 --> 01:17:32.864
we're giving all
that money to charity.

01:17:32.866 --> 01:17:35.468
- OK?
- OK.

01:17:35.470 --> 01:17:37.004
OK.

01:17:37.871 --> 01:17:39.139
Two bullets.

01:17:55.955 --> 01:17:57.822
Just walk away, Gordie.

01:17:57.824 --> 01:17:59.292
[tense music]

01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:25.581
- Whoa.
- Get the fuck away, man.

01:18:25.583 --> 01:18:27.817
That doesn't look
very good, Keats.

01:18:31.188 --> 01:18:33.455
Now you're gonna
shoot me, is that it?

01:18:33.457 --> 01:18:35.923
I don't want to, but you
kinda leave me no choice.

01:18:35.925 --> 01:18:38.059
- What the fuck are you doin'?
- Who runs away

01:18:38.061 --> 01:18:39.462
from a guy with a loaded gun?

01:18:42.232 --> 01:18:43.533
Everybody.

01:18:47.337 --> 01:18:50.103
Maybe so, but I don't
feel very comfortable

01:18:50.105 --> 01:18:51.371
with you pointing that at me.

01:18:51.373 --> 01:18:53.640
Yeah? Well too
fucking bad, man.

01:18:53.642 --> 01:18:56.009
- Just stay where you are.
- Hand it over.

01:18:56.011 --> 01:18:59.646
Keats, we talked about this,
you need bullets,

01:18:59.648 --> 01:19:01.415
you need balls.

01:19:01.417 --> 01:19:03.949
- Bullets.
- I will fuckin' shoot you.

01:19:03.951 --> 01:19:05.051
Bullets...

01:19:05.053 --> 01:19:06.652
[music intensifies]

01:19:06.654 --> 01:19:08.256

01:19:09.624 --> 01:19:11.357
balls.

01:19:11.359 --> 01:19:12.891
[tense music fades]

01:19:12.893 --> 01:19:14.227
Yeah.

01:19:17.964 --> 01:19:19.130
It's kind of funny,

01:19:19.132 --> 01:19:20.532
[eerie ambient music]

01:19:20.534 --> 01:19:23.470
I leave the gun back
there and it turns up.

01:19:28.642 --> 01:19:29.875
Well...

01:19:30.976 --> 01:19:32.845
I am sorry about all this.

01:19:34.113 --> 01:19:35.679
Are you?

01:19:35.681 --> 01:19:37.550
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

You're always sorry, aren't ya?

[Gordie grunts]

01:19:48.927 --> 01:19:50.395
You took a drunk...

01:19:51.529 --> 01:19:53.431
on the fuckin' bourbon trail.

01:19:57.368 --> 01:19:59.203
What were you thinking?

01:20:00.304 --> 01:20:02.938
What were you fuckin'
thinking, Keats?

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:04.373
[Gordie laughs]

01:20:04.375 --> 01:20:06.343
I don't know.

01:20:07.444 --> 01:20:09.977
I just... I don't know.

01:20:09.979 --> 01:20:13.516
I don't know,
I just thought maybe...

01:20:15.118 --> 01:20:18.588
things could go back to
the way they used to be.

01:20:21.089 --> 01:20:23.189
Well, things

01:20:23.191 --> 01:20:27.195
used to be a fucking
travesty, Scott.

01:20:28.163 --> 01:20:30.130
A fuckin' travesty.

01:20:30.132 --> 01:20:31.600
And you know what? For me

01:20:32.534 --> 01:20:35.270
there's no such thing
as the good old days anymore.

01:20:40.341 --> 01:20:41.640
Just don't

01:20:41.642 --> 01:20:44.109
let me die out here
like this, OK?

01:20:44.111 --> 01:20:45.613
Well...

01:20:47.481 --> 01:20:49.550
We don't get much choice
in that, do we?

[Keaton grunts]

01:20:51.652 --> 01:20:53.217

[Keaton shrieks and grunts]

01:21:28.186 --> 01:21:30.987
Listen to me, Gordie.
Deep down you're a good person,

01:21:31.522 --> 01:21:34.122
but you're burying that
person deeper and deeper.

01:21:34.124 --> 01:21:37.492
- "To thine own self be true..."
- I am not a good person!

01:21:37.494 --> 01:21:40.061
Not deep down or otherwise.

01:21:40.063 --> 01:21:41.298
You know what?

01:21:42.566 --> 01:21:44.732
- I'm OK with that.
- That's not true.

01:21:44.734 --> 01:21:48.636
You above all people have the
balls to tell me what's true?

01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:50.370
You know what you are?

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:51.605

You don't know me, Gordie!

01:21:56.345 --> 01:21:58.278
You never knew
anything about me!

01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:00.246
Not my name and

01:22:00.248 --> 01:22:02.016
this ridiculous accent.

01:22:02.551 --> 01:22:04.584
You convinced yourself
you knew all about me

01:22:04.586 --> 01:22:06.421
in order to make it
easier on yourself.

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:08.690
Or perhaps to make it harder.

01:22:10.291 --> 01:22:11.524
You don't know me
any better than

01:22:11.526 --> 01:22:13.394
the way in which
you know yourself.

01:22:14.228 --> 01:22:16.563
So who are you, Gordon Solomon?

01:22:22.236 --> 01:22:23.570
I'm Gordie Solomon...

Hm, hm.

01:22:56.568 --> 01:22:58.369

I'm gonna get you
some help, OK?

Can you tell me
what your name is?

I am so sorry, I was just
trying to get my friends home.

increase the prices.
