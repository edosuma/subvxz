How much has
the governor

I've studied
the crime scene photos,

12:09.163 --> 12:10.468

report,

12:10.599 --> 12:12.644
but it didn't say
what kind of weapon
was used.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.603
I've seen 100 wounds
like this in game.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.213
It's definitely
a 30-caliber.

12:16.344 --> 12:19.651
[SCOFFS]
A 30-caliber bullet

12:19.782 --> 12:21.697
is used in at least
11 configurations,

12:21.828 --> 12:23.743
from a .308 carbine
to a .30-06

12:23.873 --> 12:25.396
to a .300
Weatherby Magnum.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.964
Plus, if you're just
basing your findings
on the size of the hole,

12:28.095 --> 12:29.270
it could easily
have been a 7 mm

12:29.400 --> 12:31.228

more configurations.

Your shooter
could not have used
a more common caliber.

find the place

Now, there's three
methods for us
to choose from.

16:39.302 --> 16:40.912
The grid method,
which consists

16:41.043 --> 16:43.306
of seven
90-degree turns

16:43.437 --> 16:46.527
followed by
seven intersecting
90-degree turns.

16:46.657 --> 16:48.224
The fan method,

16:48.355 --> 16:49.790
where we start
at the center point,

16:49.921 --> 16:52.794
walk away from it
in a straight line,
50 yards or so,

16:52.924 --> 16:55.405
complete
a 170-degree turn

16:55.536 --> 16:57.059
and walk back
to the center point.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.105
Then do it again
a few feet over.

16:59.235 --> 17:02.238
Or the coil method,

17:02.369 --> 17:04.675
which is to start
at the incident area

17:04.806 --> 17:07.069
and circle it,
coiling back to it

17:07.200 --> 17:08.505
