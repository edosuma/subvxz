Previously on <i>Switched at Birth.</i>

00:01.756 --> 00:03.289
So, I was thinking we should hang out.

00:03.341 --> 00:04.340
Totally.

00:04.675 --> 00:05.758
You good with this?

00:05.810 --> 00:06.759
Yeah.

00:09.647 --> 00:12.565
I want you to know that I would
never try to replace your mom.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.599
She's not dead.

00:13.634 --> 00:14.600
What?

00:14.635 --> 00:15.734
She's still alive.

00:16.771 --> 00:18.637
I want you to move in with me.

00:18.673 --> 00:19.805
I have feelings for someone else.

00:19.841 --> 00:21.323
What?

00:21.359 --> 00:22.324
It's just feelings.

00:22.325 --> 00:25.172
_

00:25.479 --> 00:26.745
Hey! Nice to meet you.

00:26.781 --> 00:27.746
You, too.

00:29.417 --> 00:32.500
If you don't want me to move out
here, then you need to say it.

00:32.502 --> 00:35.835

00:35.840 --> 00:38.507
You do this now, it's done.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.491

02:45.553 --> 02:46.752
Do you know sleeping next to you

02:46.754 --> 02:48.420
is like sleeping next to a four-year-old?

02:49.590 --> 02:51.590
(Chuckles) I'm sorry.

02:52.677 --> 02:54.476
I'm pretty sure I got

02:54.512 --> 02:55.811
a foot in the face like three times.

02:55.846 --> 02:59.598
My mom used to call me
Superfudge when I was little.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.733
You know <i>Superfudge?</i>

03:00.768 --> 03:02.434
The Judy Blume book?

03:02.486 --> 03:04.687
Are you kidding? I love <i>Superfudge!</i>

03:04.739 --> 03:06.538
Finally! A book we have in common!

03:06.644 --> 03:07.810
What does that mean?

03:07.845 --> 03:11.513
Well, you read this.

03:12.683 --> 03:14.850
And I read this.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.521
What are you saying, that you're
the beauty and I'm the brain?

03:19.573 --> 03:22.524
Red, you're the beauty <i>and </i> the brains.

03:27.531 --> 03:28.580
You wanna do something tonight?

03:28.616 --> 03:30.365
My brother is spinning at Scratch.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.451
- In.
- Excellent.

03:34.505 --> 03:36.422
I gotta go.

04:39.637 --> 04:40.636
Hey, sweetheart.

04:40.671 --> 04:41.737
Hey.

04:45.576 --> 04:47.876
So, what are you gonna do today?

04:47.912 --> 04:48.877
You're lookin' at it.

04:48.913 --> 04:50.496
(Sighs)

04:51.699 --> 04:52.865
Come on, honey,

04:52.917 --> 04:55.417
I want you to get up out
of bed and get dressed.

04:55.452 --> 04:56.869
We'll apply to art school again.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.704
We'll get you a job.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.422
We gotta make a plan.

05:02.626 --> 05:06.495
I know you're sad. I remember
how much it hurts to be rejected.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.363
And I know how much you love Emmett.

05:10.634 --> 05:11.633
Honey...

05:12.803 --> 05:14.803
What's going on? Talk to me.

05:16.857 --> 05:20.359
I can't get him out of my head.

05:20.394 --> 05:22.811
I look everywhere and he's there...

05:22.863 --> 05:25.480
and it's just torture.

05:26.817 --> 05:28.650
And you think by replaying those moments,

05:28.652 --> 05:32.621
imagining them differently, it's
going to make you feel better?

05:32.656 --> 05:34.656
But then you snap out of it

05:34.658 --> 05:36.708
and you have to remember all over again

05:38.462 --> 05:39.661
that he's gone.

05:41.715 --> 05:44.499
Then you just have to
get him out of your head.

05:44.501 --> 05:45.834
If he pops in, you gotta do something else.

05:45.886 --> 05:48.503
Make a phone call, do 10 jumping jacks,

05:48.556 --> 05:51.506
I don't care what it is,
but you have to push him out.

05:52.726 --> 05:55.644
But you gotta get out. Baby steps.

05:58.899 --> 05:59.848
(Sighs)

06:21.705 --> 06:27.676
Actually, here. "Sea" is
spelled s-e-a, not s-e-e.

06:27.711 --> 06:29.378
What are those things called again?

06:29.430 --> 06:30.462
Homophones.

06:31.599 --> 06:32.764
In a million years, I
wouldn't have known that.

06:35.636 --> 06:40.689
So, hon, you remember the other
day, before we were interrupted...

06:41.809 --> 06:43.692
You were saying something about your mom.

06:45.696 --> 06:49.615
Did you mean that she's alive
in your heart? Or in heaven?

06:50.951 --> 06:53.568
Because I know how hard it can
be when someone you love dies.

06:53.621 --> 06:55.704
I meant she's alive in Georgia.

06:56.824 --> 06:59.408
But I'm not supposed to talk about it.

07:00.494 --> 07:01.460
Are you sure?

07:03.464 --> 07:07.499
She's working at a car shop back
where we used to live, in Atlanta.

07:07.551 --> 07:09.635
Her name is Hope Paxton.

07:09.670 --> 07:11.453
I found her on the Internet right away.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.455
I still haven't e-mailed her yet.

07:15.759 --> 07:17.726
Paxton is our old last name.

07:19.596 --> 07:21.763
What do you mean "old last name"?

07:21.765 --> 07:25.684
My two favorite people in
the world. What are you doing?

07:25.736 --> 07:28.520
Going over... what were they again?

07:28.572 --> 07:30.572
Homophones.

07:30.607 --> 07:31.690
Better you than me.

07:34.778 --> 07:36.978
Hey, bud, can you go up and get
ready for your trumpet lesson?

07:36.980 --> 07:37.779
Okay.

07:43.587 --> 07:47.723
You want me to go to a
social establishment at night

07:47.758 --> 07:50.459
with you and your boyfriend?

07:50.494 --> 07:52.794
(Sarcastically) Yeah,
that sounds like a blast.

07:52.846 --> 07:55.714
First of all, he's not my boyfriend.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.683
And second of all, I want you

07:57.718 --> 08:03.472
to change out of your pj's and eat
something besides chips and coffee.

08:03.474 --> 08:04.639
(Grunts dismissively)

08:04.641 --> 08:08.393
Toby's spinning and I think
he could use the support.

08:08.445 --> 08:09.444
Just come for an hour.

08:10.647 --> 08:12.647
One hour. Please?

08:12.700 --> 08:13.699
Fine.

08:14.735 --> 08:15.734
Good girl.

08:16.820 --> 08:18.653

08:19.740 --> 08:20.822
Okay, I'll see you tonight.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.617
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

09:38.652 --> 09:40.652
Lily! Hey!

09:40.704 --> 09:41.820
Hi.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.538
Are you all right?

09:43.574 --> 09:45.624
(Voice breaking) Yeah, I'm fine.

09:46.710 --> 09:49.511
I'm really sorry about you and Toby.

09:49.546 --> 09:52.497
Bay's going through a
breakup right now also,

09:52.549 --> 09:55.550
and she's absolutely miserable.

09:55.586 --> 09:58.637
I keep telling her that it just takes time.

09:58.672 --> 10:00.755
In a few months, everything's
going to be better.

10:02.426 --> 10:03.842
No, it's not.

10:03.894 --> 10:06.645
It will! It just takes time.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.598
It's never going to be okay.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.850
I know it's hard to believe
that right now, but...

10:14.438 --> 10:15.487
I'm pregnant.

10:23.113 --> 10:24.363
Are you sure?

10:24.415 --> 10:26.365
And I don't know how it happened

10:26.417 --> 10:27.499
because we were really careful.

10:30.204 --> 10:31.336
Is it Toby's?

10:32.373 --> 10:33.338
Of course.

10:34.425 --> 10:36.508
I'm sorry, it's...

10:36.544 --> 10:40.512
He told me that you said you had
feelings for some other guy...

10:40.548 --> 10:42.431
Yeah, but nothing happened with him,

10:42.466 --> 10:44.132
which I told Toby.

10:44.168 --> 10:46.552
It was just some stupid infatuation

10:46.604 --> 10:48.186
that I should've kept to myself,

10:48.222 --> 10:50.472
and now Toby hates me.

10:50.577 --> 10:51.543
Does he know?

10:52.546 --> 10:53.545
No one knows.

10:55.382 --> 10:57.182
I just moved here a year ago.

10:57.217 --> 10:59.267
I don't know that many people.

10:59.303 --> 11:01.553
My parents are 5,000 miles away

11:01.605 --> 11:03.555
and would not understand.

11:05.559 --> 11:07.526
You can't tell Melody...

11:07.561 --> 11:09.394
Or Bay, or anyone.

11:09.446 --> 11:11.563
Yeah. Of course.

11:11.565 --> 11:15.317
I'm 24 years old. I've
just started my career.

11:15.369 --> 11:18.136
I don't know how to support this baby

11:18.172 --> 11:19.338
or take care of it.

11:19.373 --> 11:22.240
I have no family here.

11:22.292 --> 11:24.543
And I'm not even with the father.

11:26.296 --> 11:28.246
You have to talk to him.

11:28.248 --> 11:30.248
I've texted him a bunch of times.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.249
He won't even respond.

11:36.050 --> 11:38.550

11:38.551 --> 11:40.440

14:38.438 --> 14:40.438
Hey, Marty! How are you doing?

14:40.490 --> 14:42.440
Thanks for coming over and doing it here.

14:42.492 --> 14:44.276
That's how I always did it with my old guy.

14:44.328 --> 14:46.611
You know, I always thought it was easier
to write a big check to the government

14:46.613 --> 14:48.613
over a glass of scotch and a nice cigar.

14:48.615 --> 14:50.498
Speaking of which,

14:50.534 --> 14:53.335
I just received this fine box
from the Dominican Republic.

14:55.289 --> 14:56.621
Is your wife around?

14:56.657 --> 15:00.458
Kathryn, no. She lets me do the
honors as far as taxes are concerned.

15:00.460 --> 15:03.161
I'd really like to talk with both of you.

15:04.214 --> 15:06.464
I'm sure I can fill
her in. What's going on?

15:08.552 --> 15:09.517
Let's sit down.

15:12.239 --> 15:14.189
(Pop music playing)

15:15.559 --> 15:17.442
- Hey, Iris!
- Hey!

15:18.478 --> 15:19.444
Hey, guys.

15:20.814 --> 15:23.481
I am gonna go grab us some of
those trivia games and a drink.

15:23.533 --> 15:25.250
- You want anything?
- I'm fine.

15:25.285 --> 15:26.234
Me, too.

15:29.489 --> 15:30.488
You're here with him?

15:30.540 --> 15:32.240
Yeah.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.409
(Sighs)

15:34.461 --> 15:36.244
He's a really good guy.

16:12.536 --> 16:16.839
_

16:16.856 --> 16:18.203
What are you talking about?

16:18.205 --> 16:19.204
Nothing.

16:20.590 --> 16:23.291
I really should get back to my friends.

16:25.462 --> 16:29.097
And I have to actually talk to my brother.

16:29.132 --> 16:30.265
No worries. Go!

16:30.300 --> 16:32.550
Be off! I shall await thee and inebriate.

16:39.192 --> 16:40.558
Hey, can I talk to you?

16:40.560 --> 16:42.560
Sorry, not right now.

16:42.612 --> 16:44.446
Later, on a break.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.231
Okay. Sure.

16:49.469 --> 16:51.569
"Hope Paxton."

16:56.543 --> 16:58.410
"Marriage record."

17:03.517 --> 17:05.150
Marcus?

17:08.255 --> 17:11.423
"Marcus Paxton."

17:13.023 --> 17:15.319

17:17.521 --> 17:21.521

17:23.521 --> 17:26.050

17:32.496 --> 17:34.446
Oh, look. I danced. It happened.

17:34.448 --> 17:36.164
- Wait a sec.
- Oh, okay.

17:36.199 --> 17:37.582
Relax.

I think I am seriously losing it.

19:09.869 --> 19:12.210

19:12.430 --> 19:15.280
I am. Did you see what just happened?

20:25.919 --> 20:29.910
_

20:32.893 --> 20:35.511
Yeah. You're right.

20:36.730 --> 20:38.564
You're the best, you know that?

20:59.837 --> 21:00.869
(Sighs)

21:04.508 --> 21:06.625
I hate to trash the guy before me,

21:06.627 --> 21:09.795
but I'm going over stuff
and I'm a little nervous.

21:10.898 --> 21:12.831
But he was a good business manager.

21:12.866 --> 21:15.634
He saved you a lot of money
to make you think that.

21:15.669 --> 21:18.470
I'm just not sure all the ways
he used were on the up and up.

21:19.690 --> 21:21.907
He depreciated more assets than you had.

21:21.942 --> 21:26.445
There's a high six-figure deficit
every year for the past nine years.

21:26.480 --> 21:27.479
What!

21:27.514 --> 21:29.648
If the IRS regards this
as gross negligence,

21:29.683 --> 21:32.484
and they decide to
penalize you, plus interest,

21:32.536 --> 21:34.853
your liability for each year could triple.

21:34.888 --> 21:38.457
Oh, my god.

21:38.492 --> 21:39.458
What do we do?

21:40.628 --> 21:43.862
My advice is to offer up our
mistakes to the government,

21:43.897 --> 21:46.715
instead of taking a chance that
they discover it on their own.

21:46.750 --> 21:48.066
When it's this much money,

21:48.102 --> 21:50.719
with such a well-known person, they
like to make examples of people.

21:50.754 --> 21:53.505
So what are we talking?

21:53.557 --> 21:54.773
I don't know yet.

21:54.808 --> 21:56.842
I'm gonna do everything I can

21:56.844 --> 21:59.711
to make this go away in as
painless a way as possible.

22:01.682 --> 22:03.682
But there will be pain.

22:12.576 --> 22:15.727
Okay. What state is west of Alabama?

22:15.763 --> 22:19.831
A, Tennessee, B, Georgia,
C, Arkansas, or D...

22:19.867 --> 22:21.783
Mississippi.

22:21.835 --> 22:23.602
D. Mississippi.

22:23.637 --> 22:25.704
Damn, I had no idea.

22:25.756 --> 22:26.705
Okay, next!

22:27.775 --> 22:30.592
The smallest state in terms of land is...

22:30.628 --> 22:31.793
Rhode Island. Obviously.

22:31.845 --> 22:34.763
Wow. It is so handy dating a brain,

22:34.798 --> 22:37.516
especially when I'm about
to win a pitcher full of beer

22:37.551 --> 22:39.851
and a basket of buffalo
wings. Thank you, milady!

22:39.887 --> 22:42.804
Were you asleep in ninth grade geography?

22:42.856 --> 22:45.857
Hungover, mostly. On wine coolers.

22:45.893 --> 22:46.858
Ugh...

22:48.562 --> 22:50.729
You know, you don't even eat buffalo wings.

22:50.731 --> 22:52.614
Let's just do something else. Pool?

22:53.701 --> 22:54.700
Yeah, sure.

23:01.825 --> 23:03.742
Iris doesn't like me.

23:03.744 --> 23:06.461
What? That's not true.

23:06.497 --> 23:08.613
Travis doesn't either. I know that.

23:08.649 --> 23:09.581
Is there anyone else?

23:11.502 --> 23:13.418
Is it because of the whole, like,

23:13.420 --> 23:15.721
cherry bomb thing, from
a million years ago?

23:15.756 --> 23:16.755
Can't they take a joke?

23:17.891 --> 23:19.524
It's not just that.

23:19.560 --> 23:20.759
Then what is it?

23:20.761 --> 23:25.430
(Sighs) They don't think that
we're right for each other.

23:25.466 --> 23:26.648
They think we're mismatched.

23:26.684 --> 23:29.518
Okay, what do you think?

23:30.604 --> 23:31.603
I don't know.

23:31.655 --> 23:32.904
You don't know?

23:32.940 --> 23:34.906
We are really different.

23:34.942 --> 23:37.442
Is this because I don't
know the capital of Arkansas?

23:37.494 --> 23:39.745
- No.
- But it's like a little bit that.

23:39.825 --> 23:42.659
You don't seem to care
that you don't know it.

23:42.711 --> 23:43.744
That's what I don't get.

23:43.796 --> 23:46.530
I wasn't valedictorian, but I'm not dumb.

23:46.565 --> 23:47.714
I know that.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.500
You know what? I don't even
know why I'm defending myself.

23:50.552 --> 23:51.668
What does it matter if they think that?

23:51.670 --> 23:53.570
What does it matter what
anyone thinks of me anyways?

23:53.605 --> 23:54.921
You don't care what
your friends think of me?

23:54.973 --> 23:58.642
No, actually, I don't.

24:01.814 --> 24:02.763
(Dance music plays)

24:04.767 --> 24:08.685
Uh, my brother finally took a break
and I really need to talk to him.

24:09.772 --> 24:11.688
Yeah. Sure. Go ahead.

24:13.692 --> 24:14.741
Sorry.

24:24.753 --> 24:26.470
Can I come in?

24:36.632 --> 24:37.848
Hey, babe.

24:37.883 --> 24:39.816
I got your text, Will's upstairs
watching TV. What's going on?

24:39.852 --> 24:41.685
What's going on, Marcus,

24:43.555 --> 24:45.806
is that I've got 911
ready to dial on my phone.

24:45.858 --> 24:49.493
You've got one minute to tell me
the truth, or I'm calling the cops.

24:54.213 --> 24:56.046
(Sighs)

24:56.048 --> 24:57.348
Hope was messed up.

24:58.434 --> 25:00.017
Strung out for years.

25:01.287 --> 25:03.053
Even while she was pregnant.

25:04.190 --> 25:07.024
- And you?
- No. I wasn't an addict.

25:08.961 --> 25:09.943
I wasn't an angel either.

25:11.314 --> 25:12.313
I was in a gang...

25:12.365 --> 25:15.232
- I know.
- And I had a record...

25:15.267 --> 25:16.300
A long one.

25:17.370 --> 25:19.286
But I turned it all around
the day Keon was born.

25:19.322 --> 25:21.372
Everything changed for me.

25:23.409 --> 25:25.209
I wanted to do better for him.

25:25.244 --> 25:28.278
But a dad with a rap sheet
doesn't play well in court.

25:28.297 --> 25:32.049
I tried to get full custody of him,
but they like to give it to the mom.

25:32.084 --> 25:34.318
And she was good at hiding her addiction.

25:36.005 --> 25:37.388
But I wanted to help her out.

25:37.423 --> 25:39.089
You have to want to be helped.

25:39.125 --> 25:41.308
Plus she had a boyfriend
who liked to slap her.

25:41.344 --> 25:43.093
Oh, no.

25:43.095 --> 25:44.995
All I know is...

25:45.031 --> 25:48.399
I showed up one day and she was passed out,

25:48.434 --> 25:51.101
a needle in her arm and Keon was missing.

25:52.438 --> 25:54.938
I tore the place apart looking for him.

25:54.990 --> 25:56.357
Finally found him in a...

25:59.111 --> 26:00.244
a trash can.

26:02.415 --> 26:06.116
Hiding, 'cause he was scared this
guy might come back and hurt him.

26:09.205 --> 26:10.337
Yeah.

26:12.124 --> 26:13.957
That was it.

26:13.959 --> 26:15.926
I grabbed Keon and started driving.

26:17.213 --> 26:18.929
I didn't stop for three days.

26:19.965 --> 26:21.348
You could've told someone.

26:21.384 --> 26:23.934
The cops, Social Services...

26:23.969 --> 26:27.304
And go back and forth for months
while he was still in her care?

26:27.356 --> 26:29.022
Risk that I'd show up one day

26:29.058 --> 26:30.357
and something'd have happened to him? No!

26:30.393 --> 26:33.060
You don't take chances like
that when it comes to your kid.

26:33.112 --> 26:35.229
So you just walked away
from your whole life?

26:35.281 --> 26:37.114
- Made up new names?
- Yeah.

26:38.417 --> 26:41.285
And changing cities every six months...

26:42.988 --> 26:46.407
not seeing my mom or my brother in years...

26:49.211 --> 26:52.129
never making any friends...

26:55.084 --> 26:57.084
But I did what I had to do

26:57.136 --> 26:59.336
to protect my son and I'd
do it again in a second.

26:59.371 --> 27:02.139
But she is his mother.

27:02.174 --> 27:05.058
She just woke up one day
and her child was missing.

27:05.094 --> 27:07.227
What if she's changed? Cleaned up?

27:07.263 --> 27:09.279
No, she hasn't!

27:09.315 --> 27:11.315
I know she hasn't.

27:11.350 --> 27:13.183
And even if she has, it's too late.

27:13.235 --> 27:14.685
She lost her shot.

27:14.687 --> 27:17.271
You mean it's too late because you
could go to jail for kidnapping.

27:20.159 --> 27:21.125
That, too.

27:21.160 --> 27:22.409
So what now?

27:22.445 --> 27:24.962
You're just gonna keep running
for the rest of your life?

27:24.997 --> 27:26.997
I wanted to stay.

27:28.200 --> 27:30.951
As long as we were safe
and no one found us.

27:35.007 --> 27:38.258
I understand how mad you must be...

27:40.129 --> 27:42.179
but I'm begging you not to turn me in.

27:44.250 --> 27:46.383
Or at least give us a
head start before you do.

27:50.306 --> 27:52.189
I'm not going to do anything tonight.

27:54.143 --> 27:55.309
I just need to think.

27:57.062 --> 27:58.362
I was going to tell you, Regina.

27:59.398 --> 28:00.898
I was.

28:02.168 --> 28:04.034
I just hadn't worked up to it yet.

28:07.239 --> 28:08.288
I'm sorry.

28:15.965 --> 28:16.964
I'm sorry.

28:27.226 --> 28:29.293
I know it's because of Skye.

28:29.361 --> 28:32.930
Have they been seeing
each other for a long time?

28:32.932 --> 28:35.182
Like the whole semester?

28:35.234 --> 28:37.317
Did everyone know but me?

28:38.318 --> 28:40.980
_

28:42.992 --> 28:44.942
You can tell me. Really.

28:44.994 --> 28:46.994
I can take it, I promise.

28:47.029 --> 28:48.946
I just want to know.

28:49.247 --> 28:51.247
_

28:51.248 --> 28:53.610
_

28:53.953 --> 28:55.002
I'm a train wreck,

28:56.121 --> 28:57.955
and I don't even think that he cares.

28:57.957 --> 29:01.341
You should've seen him
that day on the beach...

29:01.377 --> 29:03.210
He was so cold and...

29:04.511 --> 29:07.330
_

29:07.431 --> 29:11.370
_

29:11.373 --> 29:14.137
And we fall apart.

29:15.638 --> 29:22.700
_

29:25.501 --> 29:32.550
_

29:32.554 --> 29:33.991
I hope it hurts.

29:33.993 --> 29:36.209
I hope that he is miserable.

29:37.413 --> 29:40.914
He did this because of
what happened with Tank.

29:40.966 --> 29:43.000
Like that was my fault.

29:47.089 --> 29:48.171
You know something.

29:52.472 --> 29:54.483
_

29:55.584 --> 29:58.910
_

29:58.911 --> 30:04.400
_

30:06.001 --> 30:09.294
_

30:09.328 --> 30:11.028
That's not true.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.279
Things were fine.

30:12.331 --> 30:14.031
I mean, it was...

30:14.066 --> 30:18.035
it was one bad day, but we were still us.

30:18.087 --> 30:20.287
Something happened to me

30:20.339 --> 30:24.174
and he bailed because he could
only see how it affected him.

30:27.275 --> 30:29.580
_

30:29.588 --> 30:30.280
That's what happened.

30:30.316 --> 30:32.099
He's cold.

30:32.134 --> 30:34.384
He's selfish! He's heartless!

30:34.386 --> 30:36.353
And I hate him.

30:36.388 --> 30:39.389
I hate him. I will hate
him for the rest of my life.

30:39.391 --> 30:42.192
In fact, I wish that I
had never even met him!

30:46.365 --> 30:50.067
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

30:50.069 --> 30:53.270
I shouldn't have come... I should go.

30:53.571 --> 30:55.730
_

30:55.931 --> 30:59.163
_

30:59.364 --> 31:02.474
_

31:02.475 --> 31:04.699
_

31:05.000 --> 31:06.530
_

31:07.302 --> 31:11.004
Yeah, everyone keeps saying that.

31:18.263 --> 31:20.263
I just think you should talk to her.

31:20.265 --> 31:23.333
About what? Getting back together?

31:23.369 --> 31:25.235
She made her choice.

31:25.270 --> 31:29.306
I'm not going to be sloppy seconds to
some guy because he turned her down.

31:29.341 --> 31:31.324
But nothing happened with him.

31:32.995 --> 31:35.328
It was a stupid crush. She loves you.

31:35.364 --> 31:38.081
You're suddenly best friends with Lily?

31:38.117 --> 31:40.167
I ran into her.

31:40.202 --> 31:43.170
Toby, she's in a lot of pain.

31:43.205 --> 31:44.254
Good.

31:45.290 --> 31:46.289
Toby...

31:48.127 --> 31:50.293
She was embarrassed of me!

31:50.295 --> 31:55.015
Of my job, of what I wear, of my age.

31:55.050 --> 31:58.301
She wanted a guy that people
would be impressed with.

31:58.353 --> 32:00.971
Someone with a big job and a big résumé

32:01.023 --> 32:04.191
that she could bring to parties
and get ahead with her career.

32:04.276 --> 32:05.942
I don't think that's true.

32:05.978 --> 32:06.977
It is true.

32:08.230 --> 32:09.946
You love her still, right?

32:12.117 --> 32:15.368
Yeah, but that doesn't matter.

32:16.989 --> 32:18.989
She let doubts about
me creep into her brain

32:18.991 --> 32:21.074
and convince her that I wasn't good enough.

32:22.211 --> 32:25.295
So, fine. I'm over it.

32:26.331 --> 32:28.248
Look, she just wants to talk to you.

32:28.300 --> 32:31.134
And if you still care about
her, I think you owe...

32:31.170 --> 32:33.403
I don't want to hear
anything that she has to say.

32:33.538 --> 32:36.423
Lily and I, we're done. Forever.

32:38.427 --> 32:40.343
I gotta get to my next set.

32:43.015 --> 32:44.097
(Cellphone vibrates)

32:48.798 --> 32:53.600
_

32:54.026 --> 32:55.075
(Sighs)

33:04.999 --> 33:06.798
Hey, I didn't know you were down here.

33:06.834 --> 33:10.168
I was just thinking back on all
those years I had to use a laundromat.

33:10.204 --> 33:12.335
Digging under the car seat for quarters,

33:12.336 --> 33:14.579
praying I had enough to get to the towels.

33:14.925 --> 33:18.927
It's so hard hearing how bad
it was for you and Daphne.

33:20.014 --> 33:23.982
I read another story about two other girls

33:24.018 --> 33:25.734
who were switched at
birth, did you see that?

33:25.769 --> 33:27.102
No.

33:27.154 --> 33:29.821
It happened in France. They were
nine by the time they discovered it.

33:29.857 --> 33:31.595
By then, it was too late to switch back.

33:31.596 --> 33:33.249
They had bonded with their mothers by then.

33:34.194 --> 33:36.828
Yeah. Of course.

33:37.998 --> 33:39.798
Hits me all over again.

33:41.635 --> 33:43.635
Keeping Daphne from you...

33:43.671 --> 33:44.970
letting Bay be kept from me...

33:46.006 --> 33:46.972
So much time.

33:47.007 --> 33:48.724
Oh, honey,

33:48.759 --> 33:50.008
we've been through all that.

33:50.010 --> 33:51.810
I know.

33:51.846 --> 33:53.011
Just...

33:54.899 --> 33:58.567
separating a mother from her child,

33:58.602 --> 33:59.852
no matter what the reason...

33:59.904 --> 34:00.853
Look, Regina...

34:02.239 --> 34:05.891
I am never going to say that
keeping Daphne from us was right,

34:05.910 --> 34:09.695
but I think I understand why you did it.

34:09.697 --> 34:12.697
You thought it was best to
keep the girls in the family

34:12.699 --> 34:14.632
that they knew for their stability...

34:14.668 --> 34:16.001
I did.

34:16.036 --> 34:19.538
And I've been thinking about it
a lot for the past three years.

34:19.540 --> 34:21.790
And if I were in your situation,

34:21.842 --> 34:24.592
and I had to lie to protect my kid...

34:26.547 --> 34:27.763
I would've done whatever I had to, too.

34:31.051 --> 34:33.936
Did I help with whatever was bothering you?

34:35.889 --> 34:37.656
Yeah.

34:37.690 --> 34:38.639
(Chuckles) Yeah.

34:46.699 --> 34:48.567
Emmett, just tell me.

34:50.654 --> 34:52.737
Then why didn't you
tell me when it happened?

34:52.739 --> 34:55.301
_

34:56.043 --> 34:57.910
Like what? No, no, really.

34:57.912 --> 35:01.964
Like what? Like, mad because
some girl kissed my boyfriend?

35:01.999 --> 35:04.750
Stop! Stop fighting.

35:04.785 --> 35:05.951
Stop yelling at him!

35:05.986 --> 35:08.587
Don't you see you're driving him away!

35:08.639 --> 35:09.922
This is the night everything changed.

35:09.924 --> 35:13.592
Do not let him get on that
plane! Do not go to that party!

35:14.762 --> 35:15.861
Didn't you listen to Melody?

35:17.898 --> 35:20.632
Don't you get it? (Sighs)

35:21.702 --> 35:23.702
This was never about Tank

35:23.737 --> 35:25.604
or Skye. Look at us.

35:25.656 --> 35:28.690
We were growing apart. This was
going to happen no matter what.

35:28.776 --> 35:30.776
No, that's not true.

35:30.828 --> 35:34.947
Even if you had moved to L.A., it
probably still would've happened.

35:34.999 --> 35:39.718
But then you would've
been across the country

35:39.753 --> 35:42.688
and it would've been a hundred
times worse than it is now.

35:42.723 --> 35:43.839
You're wrong.

35:43.874 --> 35:46.625
I just have to go back to
this night and change it.

35:49.597 --> 35:50.796
It doesn't feel the same.

35:50.848 --> 35:54.600
I don't even know what you're
talking about half of the time.

35:59.477 --> 36:00.609
Remember?

36:00.644 --> 36:02.728
He broke up with me
because he's still mad at me

36:02.780 --> 36:04.396
for taking the fall for Daphne,

36:04.448 --> 36:05.664
but I don't regret that.

36:05.699 --> 36:06.899
I had to do it.

36:06.934 --> 36:07.900
Okay.

36:09.703 --> 36:13.455
But you have to see that for him,
that was the beginning of the end.

36:13.491 --> 36:15.541
It's both of your faults...

36:17.578 --> 36:18.710
and it's no one's fault.

36:20.748 --> 36:22.414
I miss him so much.

36:23.884 --> 36:25.501
I know.

36:26.587 --> 36:28.587
But you have to stop tormenting yourself.

36:28.589 --> 36:30.839
You have to stop replaying what went wrong.

36:32.860 --> 36:35.861
And you have to know that you'll be okay.

36:35.896 --> 36:37.763
Will I?

36:37.798 --> 36:40.432
Yeah, you will.

36:41.652 --> 36:43.602
We will.

36:48.809 --> 36:49.775
Okay.

37:23.960 --> 37:25.092
(Clears throat)

37:32.969 --> 37:34.051
I understand...

37:35.205 --> 37:36.971
Why you did what you did.

37:38.174 --> 37:40.975
I don't like it. I wish
it wasn't like this.

37:42.245 --> 37:43.227
But I understand.

37:46.249 --> 37:47.198
I'll keep your secret.

37:48.251 --> 37:50.034
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

38:19.766 --> 38:22.850
So you know how you feel
different around different people?

38:25.021 --> 38:26.254
When I'm with my friends,

38:26.289 --> 38:28.789
I feel like a leader, like
the smartest kid in class.

38:30.860 --> 38:32.860
But when I first met you,

38:32.896 --> 38:34.912
I felt like the ugly deaf girl.

38:34.948 --> 38:36.998
Daphne, you're gorgeous.

38:37.033 --> 38:40.167
(Scoffs) You're this
incredibly popular sophomore

38:40.203 --> 38:42.920
that a million girls on campus talk about.

38:42.956 --> 38:45.089
So when my friends say
this is going to end badly,

38:46.209 --> 38:48.125
it feels like they're right.

38:48.177 --> 38:50.878
Look, I don't know who
is saying what about me,

38:50.880 --> 38:54.815
but whatever image you just
painted of me is not who I am.

38:56.886 --> 39:00.087
I like you. And I don't care
what anyone thinks about us.

39:04.861 --> 39:06.861
After such a rocky semester,

39:06.896 --> 39:10.147
I just don't want to set
myself up for another failure.

39:12.235 --> 39:13.784
Does that make sense?

39:13.820 --> 39:16.871
No. You're not making any sense.

39:21.210 --> 39:23.077
I'm sorry I let other
people get in my head.

39:25.131 --> 39:26.080
It won't happen again.

39:33.256 --> 39:36.140
Hey, sweetheart, just checking up on you.

39:37.810 --> 39:39.176
I see you've rediscovered your closet.

39:39.228 --> 39:42.096
(Scoffs) Yeah, um...

39:42.148 --> 39:45.766
Hey, do you wanna go for a walk?

39:45.818 --> 39:49.070
Get some fresh air? Maybe
see a movie, just something?

39:49.105 --> 39:50.938
Yes. I do.

39:52.108 --> 39:54.775
Me, too. I'll be down in a sec.

39:59.999 --> 40:01.999
No! No, no, no, no!

40:02.035 --> 40:04.118
You are not supposed to be here!

40:04.120 --> 40:06.120
I'm kicking you out. Go.

40:07.121 --> 40:10.975
_

40:11.194 --> 40:12.159
Oh, yeah?

40:14.797 --> 40:15.796
Give me time.

40:17.100 --> 40:19.800
(Sighs) Just give me time.

40:28.978 --> 40:31.145
Hey! I heard you took a sick day.

40:31.197 --> 40:32.813
Are you not feeling well?

40:33.950 --> 40:35.950
I...

40:35.985 --> 40:38.152
- I just needed to...
- Relax, of course.

40:40.156 --> 40:43.991
Okay, so I talked to him last night,
and he's upset, but he loves you.

40:43.993 --> 40:45.826
And you love him!

40:45.878 --> 40:47.962
And I'm not saying that
this is going to be easy,

40:47.997 --> 40:49.163
but that's the most important part,

40:49.215 --> 40:51.832
how you two feel about each other.

40:51.834 --> 40:53.834
So, let's go up there

40:53.886 --> 40:55.252
and tell him what's really going on.

41:06.983 --> 41:08.099
The doctor called me...

41:09.185 --> 41:10.234
because of my brother,

41:11.988 --> 41:13.020
I went in to get tested...

41:16.075 --> 41:17.775
I knew there was a higher chance...

41:20.246 --> 41:22.830
I'm sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

41:29.005 --> 41:30.254
The baby has Down syndrome.
