WEBVTT

01:18.479 --> 01:20.514
Dr. Oppenheimer.

01:21.515 --> 01:22.717
Dr. Oppenheimer.

01:24.052 --> 01:25.653
As we begin, I believe you have

01:25.686 --> 01:27.688
a statement to read
into the record.

01:29.523 --> 01:30.725
Yes, Your Honor.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.861
We're
not judges, Doctor.

01:32.895 --> 01:33.929
No.

01:35.030 --> 01:36.430
Of course.

01:41.636 --> 01:44.572
Members of the security board,

01:44.605 --> 01:46.909
the so-called
derogatory information

01:46.942 --> 01:49.845
in your indictment of me
cannot be fairly understood,

01:49.878 --> 01:53.714
except in the context
of my life and my work.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.919
How
long did he testify?

01:56.952 --> 01:58.686
Honestly, I forget.

02:00.088 --> 02:02.057
The whole hearing took a month.

02:02.090 --> 02:03.524
An ordeal, hmm?

02:03.557 --> 02:05.227
Well, I've only read
the transcripts.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.530
Who'd want to justify
their whole life?

02:09.562 --> 02:10.798
You weren't there?

02:10.832 --> 02:13.135
As chairman, I
wasn't allowed to be.

02:13.168 --> 02:15.736
Are they really going
to ask about it?

02:15.770 --> 02:17.873
- It was years ago.
- Four years ago...

02:17.906 --> 02:18.941
Five.

02:19.808 --> 02:21.542
Oppenheimer still
divides America.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.946
The committee is gonna want
to know where you stood.

02:23.979 --> 02:26.081
Senator Thurmond asked me to say

02:26.114 --> 02:27.950
not to feel that
you're on trial.

02:27.983 --> 02:31.519
Oh, funny, I didn't
till you just said that.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.155
- Really, Mr. Strauss...
- It's Admiral.

02:33.188 --> 02:36.124
Um, Admiral Strauss.
This is a formality.

02:36.158 --> 02:38.659
President Eisenhower has asked
you to be in his cabinet.

02:38.693 --> 02:40.561
Senate really has no
choice but to confirm you.

02:40.594 --> 02:42.831
And if they bring
up Oppenheimer?

02:42.864 --> 02:45.233
When they bring up Oppenheimer,
you answer honestly.

02:45.267 --> 02:47.668
No senator can deny
you did your duty.

02:47.702 --> 02:49.838
It'll be uncomfortable.

02:49.871 --> 02:52.007
Who'd want to justify
their whole life?

02:56.945 --> 02:59.647
Why did you
leave the United States?

03:01.749 --> 03:05.153
I, uh... I wanted to
study the new physics.

03:05.187 --> 03:06.721
Was there nowhere here?

03:06.754 --> 03:08.756
I thought Berkeley
had the leading

03:08.789 --> 03:10.624
theoretical physics department.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.228
Yes. Once I built it.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.863
But first I had to go to Europe.

03:14.896 --> 03:18.266
I went to Cambridge to study
under Patrick Blackett.

03:18.300 --> 03:20.902
Were you happier
there than in America?

03:20.936 --> 03:23.071
- Happier?
- Yes.

03:27.042 --> 03:30.045
No. No, I, uh...

03:33.048 --> 03:34.883
<i>I was homesick, um...</i>

03:35.750 --> 03:37.718
emotionally immature...

03:38.887 --> 03:44.026
<i>troubled by visions
of a hidden universe.</i>

03:55.070 --> 03:56.905
Useless in the lab.

04:01.943 --> 04:04.046
Christ, Oppenheimer.

04:04.079 --> 04:06.148
Have you had any sleep?

04:07.949 --> 04:09.184
Start again.

04:09.217 --> 04:11.719
I need to go to
the lecture, sir.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.155
Why?

04:13.188 --> 04:15.090
It's Niels Bohr.

04:17.892 --> 04:19.593
Damn,
completely forgot.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.829
All right. Let's go.

04:24.166 --> 04:26.077
Oh, no, not you, Oppenheimer.

04:26.101 --> 04:27.211
You finish coating those plates.

04:27.235 --> 04:29.071
You see them?

04:34.642 --> 04:36.610
Don't
forget to clean up!

05:07.775 --> 05:11.712
<i>Quantum physics
is not a step forward,</i>

05:11.745 --> 05:15.250
it is a new way to
understand reality.

05:15.283 --> 05:18.854
Einstein's opened the door,
now we are peering through,

05:18.887 --> 05:21.789
seeing a world inside our world.

05:21.823 --> 05:27.229
A world of energy and paradox
that not everyone can accept.

06:09.337 --> 06:10.771
Yeah, definitely.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.174
Are you all right?

06:13.408 --> 06:15.243
Niels, meet J.
Robert Oppenheimer.

06:15.277 --> 06:16.777
What's the
"J" stand for?

06:16.811 --> 06:18.779
Nothing, apparently.

06:18.813 --> 06:19.915
You were at my lecture.

06:19.948 --> 06:21.349
You asked the only
good question.

06:21.383 --> 06:23.118
No one's
denying his insight.

06:23.151 --> 06:25.229
It's his laboratory work that
leaves a little to be desired.

06:25.253 --> 06:27.093
I heard you
give the same lecture...

06:27.122 --> 06:30.325
At Harvard, yes, and you
asked the same question.

06:30.358 --> 06:31.459
Why ask again?

06:31.493 --> 06:33.094
Hadn't liked your answer.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.198
Did you like it
better yesterday?

06:36.231 --> 06:37.499
A lot.

06:37.532 --> 06:39.434
You can lift the stone
without being ready

06:39.467 --> 06:41.836
for the snake that's revealed.

06:41.870 --> 06:44.005
Now it seems you're ready.

06:44.039 --> 06:46.341
But you don't enjoy the lab?

06:46.374 --> 06:49.244
So get out of Cambridge with
its beakers and potions.

06:49.277 --> 06:52.247
Go somewhere they let you think.

06:53.248 --> 06:54.883
Where?

06:55.517 --> 06:56.518
GÃ¶ttingen.

06:56.551 --> 06:58.486
- Born?
- Born.

06:58.520 --> 07:00.488
Get to Germany,
study under Max Born.

07:00.522 --> 07:03.158
Learn the ways of theory.

07:03.191 --> 07:04.226
I'll send word.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.963
Wormhole.

07:07.996 --> 07:09.364
How's your mathematics?

07:09.397 --> 07:11.366
Not good enough for the
physicist he wants to be.

07:11.399 --> 07:13.969
Algebra's like sheet music.

07:14.002 --> 07:16.471
The important thing isn't
"Can you read music?"

07:16.504 --> 07:17.505
It's "Can you hear it?"

07:17.539 --> 07:20.842
Can you hear the music, Robert?

07:21.810 --> 07:23.378
Yes, I can.

08:59.107 --> 09:00.608
The senator from Wyoming.

09:01.576 --> 09:04.045
Admiral Strauss, I'm
interested in your relationship

09:04.079 --> 09:06.948
with Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.

09:06.981 --> 09:08.583
You met him in 1947?

09:08.616 --> 09:09.584
Correct.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.386
You were commissioner

09:11.419 --> 09:12.987
of the Atomic Energy Commission?

09:13.021 --> 09:16.958
I was, but I-I actually
met Robert in my capacity

09:16.991 --> 09:19.661
as board member of the
Institute for Advanced Study

09:19.694 --> 09:21.496
at Princeton because

09:21.529 --> 09:24.165
after the war, he
was world-renowned

09:24.199 --> 09:26.601
as the great man of physics,
and I was determined

09:26.634 --> 09:29.337
to get him to run the Institute.

09:38.513 --> 09:41.583
Dr. Oppenheimer. An honor.

09:41.616 --> 09:42.951
Mr. Strauss.

09:42.984 --> 09:44.285
It's pronounced "straws."

09:45.186 --> 09:46.654
Oh-ppenheimer,
Oppenheimer.

09:46.688 --> 09:48.556
Whatever way you say it,
they know I'm Jewish.

09:50.091 --> 09:52.694
I'm president of Temple
Emanu-El in Manhattan.

09:52.727 --> 09:54.996
"Straws" is just the
Southern pronunciation.

09:55.029 --> 09:56.064
- Ah.
- Anyway,

09:56.097 --> 09:57.532
welcome to the Institute.

09:57.565 --> 09:59.200
I think you could
be very happy here.

09:59.234 --> 10:01.169
Yes, well, you'll
love the commute.

10:01.202 --> 10:02.537
The position comes
with that house

10:02.570 --> 10:04.038
for you and your wife

10:04.072 --> 10:06.241
and your, is it two children?

10:06.274 --> 10:07.075
Yes, two.

10:07.108 --> 10:10.044
I'm a great admirer
of your work.

10:10.078 --> 10:12.280
And you're a physicist
by training, Mr. Strauss?

10:12.313 --> 10:14.382
I'm sorry, uh,
common room 4:00 tea.

10:14.416 --> 10:17.185
No, I'm not trained in
physics or anything else.

10:17.218 --> 10:19.053
- I'm a self-made man.
- Ah.

10:19.087 --> 10:21.089
- I can relate to that.
- Really?

10:21.122 --> 10:23.458
Yes, my father was one.

10:23.491 --> 10:27.061
And this would be your office.

10:36.237 --> 10:38.173
I'm told he's there
most afternoons.

10:38.206 --> 10:40.308
You know, I've always wondered

10:40.341 --> 10:43.945
why you didn't involve him
in the Manhattan Project.

10:44.712 --> 10:48.216
Greatest scientific
mind of our time.

10:48.249 --> 10:50.118
Of his time.

10:50.151 --> 10:52.187
Einstein published his
Theory of Relativity

10:52.220 --> 10:55.156
more than 40 years ago now.

10:56.224 --> 10:58.660
But never embraced the
quantum world it revealed.

10:58.693 --> 11:00.228
"God doesn't play dice."

11:00.261 --> 11:02.230
Precisely.

11:02.263 --> 11:05.066
You never thought of studying
physics formally, Mr. Strauss?

11:05.099 --> 11:07.469
Well, I had offers, but
I chose to sell shoes.

11:07.502 --> 11:11.005
Lewis Strauss was once
a lowly shoe salesman.

11:11.773 --> 11:13.675
No, just a shoe salesman.

11:13.708 --> 11:15.977
Huh.

11:17.245 --> 11:20.014
- I'd love to introduce you.
- No need.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.584
I have known him for years.

11:43.806 --> 11:45.507
Albert.

11:50.111 --> 11:54.315
What was that? What
did you say to him?

11:56.451 --> 11:57.485
Oh, he's fine.

11:59.354 --> 12:02.657
Mr. Strauss, there
are things in my past

12:02.690 --> 12:04.192
you ought to be aware of.

12:04.225 --> 12:06.127
Well, as chairman of the AEC,

12:06.160 --> 12:07.629
I have access to
your security file.

12:07.662 --> 12:08.663
I've read it.

12:08.696 --> 12:10.265
- You're not worried?
- No.

12:10.298 --> 12:11.675
Why would I be worried
after everything

12:11.699 --> 12:13.167
you've done for your country?

12:13.201 --> 12:14.669
Well, times change, Mr. Strauss.

12:14.702 --> 12:16.538
Well, the purpose
of this institute

12:16.571 --> 12:19.240
is to provide a haven
for independent minds.

12:20.174 --> 12:23.177
That's you. You are
the man for the job.

12:23.211 --> 12:25.814
Well, then I'll consider it.

12:25.848 --> 12:28.116
I'll see you at the
AEC meeting tomorrow.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.088
This is one of the
most prestigious

12:34.122 --> 12:35.858
appointments in the country.

12:35.891 --> 12:38.092
Yes, with a great commute.

12:38.126 --> 12:40.428
That's why I'm considering it.

12:40.461 --> 12:42.230
<i>So,
Dr. Oppenheimer brought</i>

12:42.263 --> 12:44.666
<i>your attention to
his past associations</i>

12:44.699 --> 12:45.834
<i>before you appointed him?</i>

12:45.868 --> 12:47.302
Yes.

12:47.335 --> 12:49.170
And it didn't concern you?

12:49.203 --> 12:50.738
Just then, I was
entirely consumed

12:50.772 --> 12:54.542
with what he must have said
to Einstein to sour him on me.

12:58.146 --> 12:59.347
But later?

12:59.380 --> 13:01.316
Well, we all know
what happened later.

13:01.349 --> 13:03.718
Doctor, your, uh...
your time in Europe,

13:03.751 --> 13:05.320
you seemed to meet
with a wide range

13:05.353 --> 13:06.788
of other countries' physicists.

13:06.822 --> 13:07.823
Yes, that's right.

13:07.856 --> 13:10.124
Any Russians?

13:11.192 --> 13:12.627
None that spring to mind.

13:12.660 --> 13:15.563
If you'll just allow me to
continue with my statement...

13:15.597 --> 13:18.566
Mr. Robb, you'll have ample
opportunity to cross-examine.

13:20.803 --> 13:23.738
After GÃ¶ttingen, I
moved on to Leiden in Holland

13:23.771 --> 13:26.809
<i>where I first met Isidor Rabi.</i>

13:26.842 --> 13:29.344
Excuse me.

13:33.281 --> 13:35.617
A Yank, lecturing
on the new physics?

13:35.650 --> 13:36.718
This I have to hear.

13:36.751 --> 13:38.786
I'm an American myself.

13:38.821 --> 13:40.321
How surprising.

13:40.355 --> 13:41.422
Um...

13:41.456 --> 13:43.725
Let me know if you need
any help with the English.

13:57.705 --> 13:59.674
Wait, what's he saying?

14:10.218 --> 14:11.252
No, thank you.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.254
It's a long way to Zurich.

14:13.287 --> 14:14.927
You get any skinnier,
we're gonna lose you

14:14.957 --> 14:16.791
between the seat cushions.

14:16.825 --> 14:17.860
I'm Rabi.

14:17.893 --> 14:19.260
Oppenheimer.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.329
I caught your
lecture on molecules.

14:21.362 --> 14:22.497
Caught some of it.

14:23.631 --> 14:25.800
We're a couple of New York
Jews. How do you know Dutch?

14:25.834 --> 14:27.402
Well, I thought
I'd better learn it

14:27.435 --> 14:28.612
when I got here this semester.

14:28.636 --> 14:30.238
You learned enough
Dutch in six weeks

14:30.271 --> 14:31.974
to give a lecture on
quantum mechanics?

14:32.007 --> 14:33.508
Wanted to challenge myself.

14:33.541 --> 14:35.911
Quantum physics wasn't
challenging enough.

14:35.944 --> 14:37.679
<i>- Schvitzer.
- Schvitzer?</i>

14:37.712 --> 14:39.614
Show-off.

14:39.647 --> 14:41.492
Dutch in six weeks, but
you never learned Yiddish?

14:41.516 --> 14:43.584
They don't speak it so
much my side of the park.

14:43.618 --> 14:44.686
Screw you.

14:45.787 --> 14:47.288
You homesick?

14:47.321 --> 14:48.723
Oh, you know it.

14:49.691 --> 14:52.694
Ever get the feeling our kind
isn't entirely welcome here?

14:52.727 --> 14:53.795
Physicists?

14:53.829 --> 14:55.329
'S funny.

14:55.363 --> 14:57.432
Not in the department.

14:57.465 --> 14:58.766
They're all Jewish too.

15:00.869 --> 15:02.270
Eat.

15:04.572 --> 15:06.708
There's a German you
have to seek out.

15:07.742 --> 15:10.278
- Heisenberg.
- Right.

15:19.454 --> 15:20.956
One might be led
to the presumption

15:20.989 --> 15:23.458
that behind the quantum world,

15:23.491 --> 15:27.361
there still hides a real world
in which causality holds,

15:27.395 --> 15:29.597
but such speculation seem to us,

15:29.630 --> 15:32.366
to say it explicitly,
fruitless. Thank you.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.836
Have a great day.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.742
- Wonderful.
- Thank you.

15:40.775 --> 15:42.010
Dr. Oppenheimer.

15:42.044 --> 15:43.979
Oppenheimer, yes.

15:44.012 --> 15:45.881
I liked your paper on molecules.

15:45.914 --> 15:47.415
Probably because
you inspired it.

15:47.448 --> 15:48.960
If I inspire anything
else, let me know.

15:48.984 --> 15:50.024
We could publish together.

15:50.052 --> 15:51.887
I have to get back to America.

15:51.920 --> 15:53.654
Why? There's no one there

15:53.688 --> 15:55.891
taking quantum
mechanics seriously.

15:55.924 --> 15:57.525
That's exactly why.

15:57.558 --> 15:59.995
He's pining for the
canyons of Manhattan.

16:00.028 --> 16:02.463
Canyons of New Mexico.

16:02.497 --> 16:03.640
- You're from New Mexico?
- No.

16:03.664 --> 16:05.767
New York, but my brother
and I have a ranch

16:05.800 --> 16:07.903
outside Santa Fe.

16:07.936 --> 16:10.304
That's the America
I miss right now.

16:10.338 --> 16:12.406
Then it's best you
get home, cowboys.

16:12.440 --> 16:14.052
That's him.

16:14.076 --> 16:17.512
No, me and horses.
I don't think so.

16:17.545 --> 16:19.680
Nice to meet you.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.551
Did you ever encounter
Heisenberg again?

16:23.584 --> 16:26.487
Not in person, no, but, uh...

16:27.722 --> 16:29.825
you might say our paths crossed.

16:31.392 --> 16:33.594
On returning to America,
I accepted positions

16:33.628 --> 16:36.364
at both Caltech
and up at Berkeley.

16:40.068 --> 16:41.702
I got it,
it's all right.

17:00.421 --> 17:02.456
Dr. Lawrence,
I presume?

17:03.859 --> 17:05.093
You must be Oppenheimer.

17:05.127 --> 17:06.661
Yes.

17:06.694 --> 17:09.031
I hear you want to start a
school of quantum theory.

17:09.064 --> 17:10.731
I am starting it. Next door.

17:10.765 --> 17:12.599
- They put you in there?
- I asked for it.

17:12.633 --> 17:14.702
Wanted to be close to
you experimentalists.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.105
Theory will get you
only so far, huh?

17:17.138 --> 17:19.107
We're building a machine
to accelerate electrons.

17:19.141 --> 17:21.844
- Magnificent.
- Would you like to help?

17:21.877 --> 17:23.711
Build it? Oh, no.

17:23.743 --> 17:24.847
No, no.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.448
But I am working on theories
I'd like to test with it.

17:27.481 --> 17:28.492
When do you start teaching?

17:28.516 --> 17:30.384
I've got my first in an hour.

17:30.418 --> 17:32.420
- Seminar?
- Pupil.

17:32.453 --> 17:35.690
One student? That's it?

17:35.723 --> 17:38.459
I'm teaching something no
one here has dreamt of.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.504
But once people start hearing
what you can do with it...

17:40.528 --> 17:41.997
There's no going back.

17:44.166 --> 17:46.467
- Oh. I must have missed the...
- Ah. Lo...

17:46.500 --> 17:48.502
- Mr. Lomanitz?
- Na.

17:49.704 --> 17:50.605
Yeah.

17:50.638 --> 17:52.740
Yes, this is it. Please.

17:52.773 --> 17:53.842
Take a seat.

17:58.713 --> 18:00.514
What do you know about
quantum mechanics?

18:00.548 --> 18:02.918
I have a grasp on the basics.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.518
Then you're doing it wrong.

18:05.753 --> 18:08.023
Is light made up of
particles or waves?

18:08.056 --> 18:09.200
Quantum mechanics
says it's both.

18:09.224 --> 18:10.826
How could it be both?

18:10.859 --> 18:12.760
- It can't.
- It can't.

18:12.793 --> 18:17.665
But it is. It's paradoxical,
and yet, it works.

18:24.806 --> 18:25.807
Now.

18:27.675 --> 18:29.644
Thank you.

18:29.677 --> 18:32.680
Mr. Lomanitz. You're
gonna be okay.

18:32.713 --> 18:34.082
Mr. Snyder.

18:34.116 --> 18:35.650
Now let's consider a star.

18:35.683 --> 18:39.221
A star. A vast furnace
burning in outer space,

18:39.254 --> 18:42.657
fire pushing outwards
against its own gravity.

18:42.690 --> 18:44.126
Balanced.

18:44.159 --> 18:46.460
But if that furnace cools...

18:47.829 --> 18:49.831
and gravity starts
winning, it contracts.

18:50.832 --> 18:51.799
Density increases.

18:51.833 --> 18:53.035
Correct.

18:53.068 --> 18:54.236
Increasing gravity.

18:54.269 --> 18:55.770
Increasing density.

18:55.804 --> 18:57.940
- And?
- It's a vicious cycle until...

18:57.973 --> 18:59.607
what's the limit here?

19:00.775 --> 19:03.011
I don't know.
See where the math takes us.

19:03.045 --> 19:04.822
I guarantee it's somewhere
no one's been before.

19:04.846 --> 19:06.747
Me?

19:06.781 --> 19:08.951
Yes, you. Your math
is better than mine.

19:10.685 --> 19:12.787
<i>Dr. Oppenheimer's file</i>

19:12.821 --> 19:15.223
<i>contained detail of his
activities in Berkeley.</i>

19:15.257 --> 19:16.724
Why would they
have started a file

19:16.757 --> 19:19.694
on Dr. Oppenheimer
before the war?

19:19.727 --> 19:22.197
Well, you'd have
to ask Mr. Hoover.

19:22.230 --> 19:24.099
I'm asking you, Admiral Strauss.

19:24.132 --> 19:27.069
Uh, my assumption is that

19:27.102 --> 19:30.238
it was connected to his, uh,

19:30.272 --> 19:32.808
left-wing political activities.

19:33.909 --> 19:35.585
You shouldn't
let them bring up politics

19:35.609 --> 19:36.945
in the classroom, Oppie.

19:36.979 --> 19:38.713
I wrote that.

19:38.746 --> 19:42.017
Lawrence, you embrace the
revolution in physics.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.852
Can't you see it
everywhere else?

19:43.885 --> 19:45.988
Picasso, Stravinsky,
Freud, Marx.

19:46.021 --> 19:47.621
Well, this
is America, Oppie.

19:47.655 --> 19:49.024
We had our revolution.

19:50.158 --> 19:52.660
Seriously, keep
it out of the lab.

19:52.693 --> 19:55.796
Well, out of the
lab, my landlady

19:55.831 --> 19:58.632
is having a discussion
group tonight. Interested?

19:58.666 --> 20:00.735
I have sampled the
Berkeley political scene.

20:00.768 --> 20:02.804
It's all just
philosophy post-grads

20:02.838 --> 20:05.140
and Communists
talking integration.

20:05.173 --> 20:06.842
You don't care
about integration.

20:06.875 --> 20:08.743
I want to vote for
it, not talk about it.

20:08.776 --> 20:10.778
'Specially on a Friday.
Come on, let's eat.

20:10.812 --> 20:13.148
I'm meeting
my brother there.

20:13.181 --> 20:15.059
<i>And how
would these activities</i>

20:15.083 --> 20:16.218
<i>have come to the attention</i>

20:16.251 --> 20:17.252
of the FBI?

20:17.285 --> 20:19.254
Well, if I remember correctly,

20:19.287 --> 20:21.223
the FBI was taking
license plates

20:21.256 --> 20:23.591
outside suspected
Communist gatherings,

20:23.624 --> 20:25.626
<i>and his name popped up.</i>

20:33.201 --> 20:34.735
- Gotcha!
- Jesus Christ.

20:34.769 --> 20:37.072
- Sorry. Hi, brother.
- Frank.

20:38.073 --> 20:39.808
Uh, you remember Jackie.

20:39.841 --> 20:41.309
Evening.

20:41.343 --> 20:43.311
Let's go. Come.

20:43.345 --> 20:45.914
Right over there,
right over there.

20:46.848 --> 20:49.851
Robert. I want you
to meet Chevalier.

20:49.885 --> 20:53.587
Dr. Haakon Chevalier,
Dr. Robert Oppenheimer.

20:53.621 --> 20:54.789
- Pleasure.
- Pleasure.

20:54.823 --> 20:56.124
This is my little
brother, Frank.

20:56.158 --> 20:57.359
- And this is...
- Hello.

20:57.392 --> 20:59.327
- Still Jackie.
- Hello, Still Jackie.

20:59.361 --> 21:01.329
Chevalier, you're in languages?

21:01.363 --> 21:03.098
And your reputation
precedes you.

21:03.131 --> 21:04.866
- What have you heard?
- Excuse me.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.676
That you're teaching a radical
new approach to physics

21:06.700 --> 21:07.945
I have no chance
of understanding,

21:07.969 --> 21:09.347
but I hadn't heard
you're a Party member.

21:09.371 --> 21:11.672
- Uh, I'm not.
- Oh, not yet.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.683
Frank and I are thinking of
joining. Just the other day,

21:13.707 --> 21:15.353
- I was saying...
- I support a range of causes.

21:15.377 --> 21:17.012
The
Spanish Civil War?

21:17.045 --> 21:18.779
A democratic republic
being overthrown

21:18.814 --> 21:20.115
by fascist thugs, who wouldn't?

21:20.148 --> 21:21.817
Our government.

21:21.850 --> 21:23.327
They think that socialism is
a bigger threat than fascism.

21:23.351 --> 21:24.853
Not for long.

21:24.886 --> 21:26.687
Look at what the Nazis
are doing to the Jews.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.291
I send funds to colleagues
in Germany to emigrate.

21:29.324 --> 21:31.359
I have to do something.

21:31.393 --> 21:34.762
My own work
is so abstract.

21:34.795 --> 21:36.364
What are you working on?

21:36.398 --> 21:38.333
What happens to the
stars when they die.

21:38.366 --> 21:39.800
Do stars die?

21:41.002 --> 21:42.304
Well, if they do,

21:42.337 --> 21:44.239
they'd cool, then collapse.

21:44.272 --> 21:46.908
In fact, the bigger the star,

21:46.942 --> 21:49.643
<i>the more violent its demise.</i>

21:49.677 --> 21:51.213
The gravity gets so concentrated

21:51.246 --> 21:54.216
it swallows everything.

21:54.249 --> 21:55.217
Everything, even light.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.418
Can that really happen?

21:56.451 --> 21:58.253
The math says it can.

21:58.286 --> 21:59.720
If we can get published,

21:59.753 --> 22:01.332
then perhaps one day,
an astronomer finds one.

22:01.356 --> 22:03.091
But right now, all
I have is theory,

22:03.125 --> 22:04.993
which can't impact
people's lives.

22:05.026 --> 22:07.295
Well, if you're going
to send money to Spain,

22:07.329 --> 22:08.897
do it through the
Communist Party.

22:08.930 --> 22:10.274
They can get it to
the front lines.

22:10.298 --> 22:12.700
Mary sent me with these.

22:13.401 --> 22:16.204
- I'm Jean.
- Robert.

22:16.238 --> 22:17.738
Haakon Chevalier.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.317
The union meeting at
Serber's last month?

22:19.341 --> 22:20.741
Right, right, yes.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.144
Oh, thank you.

22:22.177 --> 22:24.412
Robert here
says he's not a Communist.

22:24.446 --> 22:26.747
Well, then he doesn't
know enough about it.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.151
Oh, I've read <i>Das Kapital,</i>
all three volumes.

22:29.184 --> 22:30.819
Does that count?

22:30.852 --> 22:32.830
It would make you better
read than most party members.

22:32.854 --> 22:35.157
Turgid stuff. There's
some thinking, um,

22:35.190 --> 22:36.358
"Ownership is theft."

22:36.391 --> 22:38.293
- "Property."
- "Property"?

22:38.326 --> 22:40.128
"Property," not "ownership."

22:40.162 --> 22:42.197
I'm sorry, I read it
in the original German.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.900
Well.

22:45.766 --> 22:47.135
It's not about the book.

22:47.169 --> 22:50.172
It's about the ideas. And
you sound uncommitted.

22:50.205 --> 22:51.840
Well, I'm committed
to thinking freely

22:51.873 --> 22:54.309
about how to improve our world.

22:54.342 --> 22:56.444
Why limit yourself to one dogma?

22:56.478 --> 22:59.447
You're a physicist, you
pick and choose rules?

22:59.481 --> 23:01.049
Or do you use the discipline

23:01.082 --> 23:03.218
to channel your
energies into progress?

23:03.251 --> 23:05.654
I like a little wiggle room.

23:06.754 --> 23:08.957
Do you always tow
the party line?

23:10.325 --> 23:12.093
I like my wiggle room too.

23:22.237 --> 23:24.772
What?

23:24.806 --> 23:25.974
Wait, wait, wait.

23:29.878 --> 23:31.479
Unexpected.

23:31.513 --> 23:33.415
- What?
- For a physicist.

23:33.448 --> 23:36.218
You only have a
shelf full of Freud?

23:36.251 --> 23:39.120
Well, actually, my
background's more...

23:39.154 --> 23:40.989
Uh, Jungian?

23:42.123 --> 23:43.225
You know analysis?

23:43.258 --> 23:45.793
When I was in
post-grad at Cambridge,

23:45.827 --> 23:47.128
I had a little trouble.

23:48.129 --> 23:50.865
- I'll bite.
- I tried to poison my tutor.

23:50.899 --> 23:51.900
Did you hate him?

23:51.933 --> 23:53.401
I liked him very much.

23:53.435 --> 23:55.337
You just needed to get laid.

23:55.370 --> 23:56.938
Took my analyst two years,

23:56.972 --> 23:58.916
and I don't think they ever
put it that succinctly.

23:58.940 --> 24:00.275
You have everyone convinced

24:00.308 --> 24:03.044
you're more complicated
than you actually are.

24:03.078 --> 24:05.080
We're all simple souls, I guess.

24:05.113 --> 24:06.281
I'm not.

24:09.150 --> 24:10.185
What's this?

24:10.218 --> 24:11.785
Sanskrit.

24:11.820 --> 24:13.121
You can read this?

24:13.154 --> 24:14.956
I'm learning.

24:19.160 --> 24:20.962
Read this.

24:22.397 --> 24:24.032
Well, in this part,

24:24.065 --> 24:26.268
Vishnu reveals his
multi-armed self...

24:26.301 --> 24:27.302
No.

24:28.370 --> 24:30.238
Read the words.

24:33.608 --> 24:36.777
"And now I am become Death.

24:42.217 --> 24:43.952
Destroyer of worlds."

25:14.883 --> 25:16.217
This'll do.

25:22.357 --> 25:23.958
It'll break before dawn.

25:23.992 --> 25:27.362
Air cools overnight, just
before dawn, it breaks.

25:30.031 --> 25:31.966
Come.

25:38.006 --> 25:41.476
Ah. So, I'm getting married.

25:41.509 --> 25:43.111
- Frank. Congratulations!
- Thank you.

25:43.144 --> 25:44.946
- Thank you.
- To Jackie?

25:44.979 --> 25:47.349
Yeah, to Jackie.

25:47.382 --> 25:48.483
The waitress.

25:48.516 --> 25:50.485
Oppie, you're right.
It's lettin' up.

25:50.518 --> 25:52.954
I'm gonna go see if
there's any stars.

25:52.987 --> 25:55.023
All your talk about
the common man,

25:55.056 --> 25:56.567
but Jackie's not good
enough for you, hmm?

25:56.591 --> 25:57.625
Mm-mm.

25:57.659 --> 25:59.160
We join the Party and you can't

25:59.194 --> 26:00.962
- hide your disapproval. Why?
- Oh, now, I...

26:00.995 --> 26:02.073
Is that because that's
supposed to be your thing?

26:02.097 --> 26:03.631
I haven't joined
the Party, Frank.

26:03.665 --> 26:06.201
And I don't think she should
have convinced you to either.

26:06.234 --> 26:07.969
Half of the faculty
is Communist.

26:08.002 --> 26:09.070
Not that half.

26:10.405 --> 26:13.141
I'm your brother, Frank, and
I want you to be cautious.

26:13.174 --> 26:14.876
And I want to wring your neck.

26:17.278 --> 26:20.181
I won't live my life
afraid to make a mistake.

26:22.050 --> 26:25.387
You're happy, I'm happy.

26:25.420 --> 26:26.955
So then I'm happy you're happy

26:26.988 --> 26:28.323
that I'm happy.

26:32.594 --> 26:34.195
I feel
like I could see

26:34.229 --> 26:36.331
one of those dark stars
that you're working on.

26:36.364 --> 26:38.933
You can't. That's
the whole point.

26:39.601 --> 26:41.302
Their gravity swallows light.

26:42.570 --> 26:45.640
It's like a kind
of hole in space.

26:45.673 --> 26:47.008
Is Frank okay?

26:47.041 --> 26:49.444
Yes. He just has
a shitty brother.

26:50.578 --> 26:52.247
It is special here.

26:54.616 --> 26:57.085
When I was a kid,

26:57.118 --> 27:00.155
I thought if I could find a way

27:00.188 --> 27:04.559
to combine physics
and New Mexico,

27:04.592 --> 27:07.128
my life would be
perfect.

27:08.196 --> 27:09.464
Little remote for that.

27:09.497 --> 27:10.632
Yes.

27:10.665 --> 27:12.333
Let's get some sleep.

27:13.301 --> 27:14.702
That mesa
we saw today,

27:14.736 --> 27:17.238
one of my favorite
places in the world.

27:18.072 --> 27:19.541
And tomorrow we'll climb it.

27:19.574 --> 27:21.009
What's it called?

27:22.043 --> 27:24.112
Los Alamos.

27:27.215 --> 27:29.217
I didn't expect
to see you today.

27:30.385 --> 27:32.220
Do I have to make
an appointment?

27:34.155 --> 27:36.291
Hey! Hey,
get back here!

27:36.324 --> 27:37.459
Alvarez?

27:43.231 --> 27:46.067
Oppie! Oppie!

27:46.100 --> 27:48.102
What? What is it?

27:48.136 --> 27:49.737
They've done it.
They've done it.

27:49.771 --> 27:51.039
Hahn and Strassmann in Germany.

27:51.072 --> 27:53.241
They split the uranium nucleus.

27:54.108 --> 27:55.977
How?

27:56.711 --> 27:58.613
Bombard it with neutrons.

27:58.646 --> 27:59.791
It's a
nuclear fission.

27:59.815 --> 28:01.449
They did it, they
split the atom.

28:01.483 --> 28:03.051
It's not possible.

28:09.190 --> 28:10.992
I'm gonna try to reproduce it.

28:17.632 --> 28:19.567
See? Can't be done.

28:20.668 --> 28:24.072
Very
elegant. Quite clear.

28:24.105 --> 28:26.741
- There's just one problem.
- Where?

28:26.774 --> 28:28.576
Next door.

28:28.610 --> 28:30.545
Alvarez did it.

28:30.578 --> 28:32.714
But then look...

28:32.747 --> 28:36.084
these fission pulses,
they're massive.

28:36.117 --> 28:39.387
I've seen 30 of these
in the past ten minutes.

28:39.420 --> 28:42.257
Theory will take
you only so far.

28:43.758 --> 28:45.760
During the process...

28:45.793 --> 28:47.529
extra neutrons boil off,

28:47.562 --> 28:50.732
which could be used to
split other uranium atoms.

28:50.765 --> 28:52.166
Chain reaction.

28:52.200 --> 28:53.836
You're thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'.

28:53.869 --> 28:56.638
You, me, and every other
physicist around the world

28:56.671 --> 28:58.172
who's seen the news.

28:58.874 --> 29:00.675
I'm... what? What
are we all thinking?

29:00.708 --> 29:04.479
A bomb, Alvarez.

29:05.647 --> 29:07.348
A bomb.

29:07.382 --> 29:10.585
I told you, Robert, no
more fucking flowers.

29:12.186 --> 29:13.731
I don't understand
what you want from me.

29:13.755 --> 29:15.523
I don't want anything from you.

29:16.524 --> 29:18.560
Well, you say that
and then you call.

29:18.593 --> 29:21.195
Well, don't answer.

29:21.229 --> 29:23.231
I'll always answer.

29:28.503 --> 29:29.437
Fine.

29:29.470 --> 29:32.173
Just no more flowers.

29:33.207 --> 29:34.576
You're not coming?

29:35.743 --> 29:38.546
You have to know
when you're beaten, Robert.

29:40.849 --> 29:42.584
It's not that simple, Hoke.

29:42.617 --> 29:44.786
Chevalier, good
to see you. It's...

29:44.820 --> 29:46.154
Ah, Barbara, good to see you

29:46.187 --> 29:48.656
and the illustrious
Dr. Oppenheimer.

29:48.690 --> 29:49.858
I'm Eltenton.

29:49.892 --> 29:51.268
- Oh, pleasure.
- Please, please.

29:51.292 --> 29:52.460
Now, might you say a word

29:52.493 --> 29:55.229
about organized labor
on campuses, yes?

29:55.263 --> 29:56.798
Coming through! Coming through!

29:56.832 --> 29:58.409
- F.A.E.C.T.!
- I work at Shell.

29:58.433 --> 30:00.444
We've signed up chemists,
we've signed up engineers,

30:00.468 --> 30:02.337
so why not scientists
in academia?

30:02.370 --> 30:05.273
Oppie!
Oppie! Oppie!

30:05.306 --> 30:08.576
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

30:08.610 --> 30:10.244
Oppie! Oppie!

30:10.278 --> 30:13.181
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

30:16.351 --> 30:20.321
Teachers are unionized.
Why not professors?

30:20.355 --> 30:21.789
Don't you have somewhere to be?

30:21.824 --> 30:23.658
Lawrence, academics
have rights too.

30:23.691 --> 30:26.194
Look, it's not that.
I've got a group coming.

30:26.227 --> 30:29.430
- Well, I'll sit in.
- Not this one.

30:35.703 --> 30:37.372
Richard. Dr. Bush.

30:37.405 --> 30:39.474
What brings you two up north?

30:48.951 --> 30:50.318
Richard, you tell Ruth

30:50.351 --> 30:51.671
I'll be down to
Pasadena Thursday.

31:00.628 --> 31:03.264
Your paper
on black holes is in!

31:03.297 --> 31:05.266
Oppie!

31:05.299 --> 31:08.937
Where's Hartland? Get
Hartland. Get Hartland.

31:08.971 --> 31:11.239
September 1st, 1939,

31:11.272 --> 31:13.508
the world's gonna
remember this day.

31:14.442 --> 31:15.920
Oh, Hartland. Our
paper, it's in print.

31:15.944 --> 31:18.680
You've been upstaged.

31:22.283 --> 31:24.820
During the Battle of
Britain, I found myself

31:24.853 --> 31:27.588
increasingly out of sympathy
with the

31:27.622 --> 31:30.625
policy of neutrality that
Communists advocated.

31:30.658 --> 31:34.462
Right after Hitler invaded
Russia and we became allies,

31:34.495 --> 31:36.531
these Communist sympathies,
did they return?

31:36.564 --> 31:37.598
No.

31:38.733 --> 31:42.336
I need to make clear that
my changing views on Russia

31:42.370 --> 31:43.604
did not mean a sharp break

31:43.638 --> 31:45.707
from those who held
different views.

31:45.740 --> 31:48.309
For a year or two, and
during a previous marriage,

31:48.342 --> 31:51.646
my wife Kitty had been a
Communist Party member.

31:54.282 --> 31:55.616
Oop!

31:55.650 --> 31:57.452
This way. This is where
I keep the good stuff.

31:57.485 --> 31:59.487
Well, I thought this
was the Tolmans' house.

31:59.520 --> 32:01.723
I live with them
while I'm at Caltech.

32:01.756 --> 32:03.257
Do you two need anything?

32:03.291 --> 32:04.759
We're good, Ruthie.

32:05.861 --> 32:08.496
So, you're a biologist.

32:08.529 --> 32:11.733
Well, somehow I have
graduated to housewife.

32:11.766 --> 32:14.903
Can you explain quantum
mechanics to me?

32:14.937 --> 32:15.971
Seems baffling.

32:16.004 --> 32:17.705
Yes, it is.

32:18.807 --> 32:21.609
Well, this glass,

32:21.642 --> 32:22.543
this drink...

32:22.577 --> 32:25.680
this countertop,

32:25.713 --> 32:28.817
uh, our bodies...

32:28.851 --> 32:30.752
all of it.

32:30.785 --> 32:33.354
It's mostly empty space.

32:33.387 --> 32:35.891
Groupings of tiny energy
waves bound together.

32:35.924 --> 32:37.792
By what?

32:37.826 --> 32:41.395
Forces of attraction strong
enough to convince us

32:41.429 --> 32:43.631
that matter is solid.

32:43.664 --> 32:46.801
Stop my body passing
through yours.

32:58.546 --> 33:00.048
You're married to Dr. Harrison.

33:00.082 --> 33:01.817
Not very.

33:03.852 --> 33:07.555
There is someone that I feel...

33:07.588 --> 33:09.024
Does she feel the same way?

33:09.057 --> 33:12.895
Sometimes. Not enough.

33:14.096 --> 33:17.065
You know, I'm going
to New Mexico.

33:17.099 --> 33:18.901
To my ranch, with friends.

33:18.934 --> 33:20.301
You should come.

33:21.103 --> 33:22.938
I meant with your husband.

33:22.971 --> 33:24.539
Yes, you did.

33:24.572 --> 33:27.475
'Cause you know it won't
make a bit of difference.

33:31.445 --> 33:32.948
Why did you marry him?

33:32.981 --> 33:36.517
I was lost and he was kind.

33:38.686 --> 33:39.554
Lost?

33:39.587 --> 33:43.091
Well, my previous
husband had died, and...

33:43.125 --> 33:45.560
at 28, I wasn't really
ready to be a widow.

33:45.593 --> 33:47.595
- Who was your first husband?
- Nobody.

33:47.628 --> 33:50.098
But my second husband
was Joe Dallet.

33:50.132 --> 33:53.101
He was, um, from
money, like me, but...

33:53.135 --> 33:56.071
he was a union organizer
in Youngstown, Ohio.

33:56.104 --> 33:57.371
Fell hard.

33:57.405 --> 33:58.673
How hard?

33:58.706 --> 34:00.374
Hard enough to spend
the next four years

34:00.408 --> 34:01.742
living off beans and pancakes,

34:01.776 --> 34:04.545
handing out the <i>Daily
Worker</i> at factory gates.

34:04.579 --> 34:07.082
By 36, I just told Joe I
couldn't take it anymore.

34:07.115 --> 34:08.984
Quit the Party and a year later,

34:09.016 --> 34:12.553
I wanted him back, so...
Him, not the <i>Daily Worker.</i>

34:12.587 --> 34:14.731
And he said, "Swell, I'll
meet you on my way to Spain."

34:14.755 --> 34:16.456
He went to fight
for the Loyalists?

34:16.489 --> 34:18.592
And then he went to the
brigades and I waited.

34:18.626 --> 34:19.694
And...

34:20.561 --> 34:21.929
Joe got himself killed

34:21.964 --> 34:24.364
first time he popped his
head out of the trench.

34:25.699 --> 34:28.136
Ideology got Joe
killed. For nothing.

34:28.170 --> 34:30.038
Spanish Republic isn't nothing.

34:30.072 --> 34:31.181
My husband offered
both our futures

34:31.206 --> 34:32.672
to stop one fascist bullet

34:32.706 --> 34:34.877
from embedding
itself in a mudbank.

34:35.775 --> 34:37.612
That's the definition
of nothing.

34:37.645 --> 34:39.647
Seems a little reductive.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.415
Pragmatic.

34:41.449 --> 34:43.886
Now here I am.

34:46.121 --> 34:47.722
Wherever the hell this is.

34:54.762 --> 34:58.033
I didn't want you to
hear it from anyone else.

35:00.468 --> 35:03.805
Least you didn't bring
me flowers.

35:08.944 --> 35:12.513
We both know I'm not
what you want, Jean.

35:13.547 --> 35:16.184
Yeah, but it's a door closing.

35:16.218 --> 35:17.618
No.

35:19.187 --> 35:21.555
Not as far as I'm concerned, no.

35:22.757 --> 35:24.492
You knocked her up, fast work.

35:24.525 --> 35:27.162
Can't keep a good man down.

35:27.195 --> 35:29.197
I meant her.

35:29.231 --> 35:31.233
She knew what she wanted.

35:31.266 --> 35:33.201
What about the husband?

35:33.235 --> 35:34.702
We talked, um,

35:34.735 --> 35:36.671
they're getting a divorce, so...

35:36.704 --> 35:40.474
we can get married before
she starts showing.

35:40.508 --> 35:41.977
How civilized.

35:43.946 --> 35:45.047
You idiot.

35:45.080 --> 35:46.848
This is your community.

35:46.882 --> 35:49.818
You think the rules don't
apply to the golden boy?

35:50.986 --> 35:52.620
Brilliance makes up for a lot.

35:52.653 --> 35:55.157
Don't alienate the only
people in the world

35:55.190 --> 35:56.858
that understand what you do.

35:58.592 --> 35:59.962
One day you might need them.

35:59.995 --> 36:02.730
F.A.E.C.T. MEMBERS
F.A.E.C.T.!

36:02.763 --> 36:03.975
The Federation
of Architects,

36:03.999 --> 36:07.135
Engineers, Chemists
and Technicians.

36:13.574 --> 36:16.111
Lomanitz, what do
you get paid a month?

36:16.144 --> 36:17.288
That's not the point, Lawrence.

36:17.312 --> 36:19.613
What do any of
you have in common

36:19.647 --> 36:22.250
with farm laborers
and dock workers?

36:22.284 --> 36:23.852
Plenty.

36:24.920 --> 36:27.456
Everybody out. Now!

36:31.293 --> 36:32.693
Not you.

36:38.632 --> 36:39.600
What are you doing?

36:39.633 --> 36:41.303
It's a trade union.

36:41.336 --> 36:43.271
Filled with Communists.

36:43.305 --> 36:45.007
So? I haven't joined the Party.

36:45.040 --> 36:47.142
They won't let me bring
you onto the project

36:47.175 --> 36:48.877
because of this shit.

36:48.910 --> 36:50.687
They won't even let me tell
you what the project is.

36:50.711 --> 36:53.148
Oh. I know
what the project is.

36:53.181 --> 36:54.249
Oh, really?

36:54.282 --> 36:55.583
We've all heard about Einstein

36:55.616 --> 36:56.894
and Szilard's
letter to Roosevelt

36:56.918 --> 36:58.719
warning him the Germans
could make a bomb,

36:58.753 --> 37:01.622
and I know what it means for
the Nazis to have a bomb.

37:01.655 --> 37:03.025
Oh, and I don't?

37:03.058 --> 37:05.693
It's not your people
they're herding into camps.

37:06.794 --> 37:07.795
It's mine.

37:07.829 --> 37:10.966
You think that I tell
them about your politics.

37:12.067 --> 37:14.635
The next time you're
coming home from a meeting,

37:14.668 --> 37:16.704
why don't you take a look
in the rearview mirror?

37:16.737 --> 37:18.807
Listen to the sounds
on your phone line

37:18.840 --> 37:21.910
and stop being so goddamn naive.

37:23.211 --> 37:24.745
Why would they care what I do?

37:24.779 --> 37:26.747
Because you're
not just self-important,

37:26.781 --> 37:28.950
you're actually important.

37:30.185 --> 37:31.552
Okay.

37:32.187 --> 37:35.190
Okay. I get it.

37:35.223 --> 37:37.292
If you could just
be a little more...

37:37.325 --> 37:38.827
Pragmatic.

37:38.860 --> 37:39.971
I'll talk to Lomanitz,
I'll talk to the others,

37:39.995 --> 37:42.097
you don't have to
worry. It's done.

37:42.130 --> 37:43.899
Lawrence.

37:48.736 --> 37:50.738
Then welcome to the war.

37:50.771 --> 37:53.075
I filled out my
first security questionnaire

37:53.108 --> 37:54.376
and was informed

37:54.409 --> 37:56.211
that my involvement
with left-wing groups

37:56.244 --> 38:00.182
would not prove a bar to my
working on the atomic program.

38:00.215 --> 38:02.951
<i>Why were
his Communist associations</i>

38:02.984 --> 38:06.088
not seen as a security
risk during the war?

38:06.121 --> 38:07.856
Senator, I can't possibly answer

38:07.889 --> 38:11.226
for security clearance granted
years before I ever met the man.

38:11.259 --> 38:13.261
Fine. What about after?

38:13.295 --> 38:15.230
After the war, Dr. Oppenheimer

38:15.263 --> 38:19.034
was the most respected
scientific voice in the world.

38:19.067 --> 38:21.103
That's why I asked him
to run the Institute,

38:21.136 --> 38:24.239
that's why he advised the
Atomic Energy Commission.

38:24.272 --> 38:25.340
Simple as that.

38:25.373 --> 38:27.976
What are they accusing me of?

38:28.009 --> 38:29.777
I think they just want
to know what happened

38:29.811 --> 38:32.314
between 1947 and 1954
to change your mind

38:32.347 --> 38:34.382
on Oppenheimer's
security clearance.

38:34.416 --> 38:37.152
I didn't. I was
chair of the AEC,

38:37.185 --> 38:40.754
but it wasn't me that brought
the charges against Robert.

38:40.788 --> 38:42.033
- Who did?
- Some former staff member

38:42.057 --> 38:43.992
of the Joint
Congressional Committee.

38:44.025 --> 38:47.095
He was a rabid
anti-Communist named Borden.

38:47.129 --> 38:49.431
He wrote to the FBI
demanding they take action.

38:49.464 --> 38:52.000
The FBI? Why not go
to the AEC, direct?

38:52.033 --> 38:54.735
Why get caught holding
the knife yourself?

38:54.768 --> 38:57.205
What did Borden have
against Oppenheimer?

38:57.239 --> 38:59.074
This was the McCarthy Era.

38:59.107 --> 39:04.012
People hounded out of jobs
for any hint of red. And then,

39:04.045 --> 39:05.713
<i>reading Oppenheimer's
security file,</i>

39:05.746 --> 39:07.916
<i>his Communist brother,
sister-in-law,</i>

39:07.949 --> 39:10.018
<i>fiancÃ©e, best friend, wife.</i>

39:10.051 --> 39:12.387
That's before we even get
to the Chevalier incident.

39:12.420 --> 39:16.158
But how would Borden have access
to Oppenheimer's security file?

39:16.191 --> 39:17.859
Because somebody gave it to him.

39:19.027 --> 39:21.695
Somebody who wanted
Robert silenced.

39:21.729 --> 39:23.331
- Who?
- Who knows?

39:23.365 --> 39:25.901
Robert didn't take
care not to upset

39:25.934 --> 39:28.170
the power brokers in Washington.

39:28.203 --> 39:31.072
His opinions on the
atom became definitive

39:31.106 --> 39:34.009
and he wasn't always patient
with us mere mortals.

39:37.412 --> 39:39.848
I came in for plenty
of harsh treatment.

39:39.881 --> 39:43.051
There was an AEC vote

39:43.084 --> 39:45.053
on the export of
isotopes to Norway,

39:45.086 --> 39:48.056
<i>and they drafted in Robert
to make me look like a fool.</i>

39:48.089 --> 39:49.790
But,
Dr. Oppenheimer,

39:49.824 --> 39:51.927
we've already heard from
Admiral Strauss that

39:51.960 --> 39:54.795
these isotopes could be
useful to our enemies

39:54.829 --> 39:56.140
in the production
of atomic weapons.

39:56.164 --> 39:58.033
Congressmen,
you could use a shovel

39:58.066 --> 39:59.510
in making atomic weapons.

39:59.534 --> 40:00.734
In fact, you do.

40:00.768 --> 40:02.304
You could use a bottle of beer

40:02.337 --> 40:03.737
in making atomic weapons.

40:03.771 --> 40:05.240
In fact, you do.

40:05.273 --> 40:08.210
I say isotopes are less useful
than electronic components

40:08.243 --> 40:11.012
but more useful than a sandwich.

40:14.249 --> 40:16.117
<i>Genius is no
guarantee of wisdom.</i>

40:17.118 --> 40:19.888
How could this man who
saw so much be so blind?

40:29.397 --> 40:30.832
Kitty?

40:35.537 --> 40:37.472
Kitty?

40:37.505 --> 40:40.909
Kitty, the project...

40:41.876 --> 40:44.479
I'm in. I'm in.

40:44.512 --> 40:46.281
Let's celebrate.

40:51.920 --> 40:53.521
Shouldn't you go to him?

40:58.126 --> 41:01.296
I have been going to
him all fucking day.

41:25.053 --> 41:26.787
Come here, darling.

41:27.889 --> 41:29.457
I don't know how to say this.

41:29.491 --> 41:32.193
I'm... I'm ashamed to ask.

41:32.227 --> 41:34.162
Anything.

41:34.195 --> 41:34.996
Take Peter.

41:35.030 --> 41:38.066
- Sure.
- No, for-for a while, Hoke.

41:38.099 --> 41:40.068
A while.

41:41.636 --> 41:43.438
Does Kitty know you're here?

41:43.471 --> 41:45.206
Yes, of course she knows.

41:46.074 --> 41:48.076
Of course she knows.

41:48.109 --> 41:51.813
We're awful people.
Selfish, awful people.

41:53.315 --> 41:54.316
Forget I asked.

41:54.349 --> 41:56.184
Selfish, awful people,

41:56.217 --> 41:58.620
they don't know they're
selfish and awful.

41:58.653 --> 42:01.222
Sit, sit, sit.

42:02.257 --> 42:06.361
Robert, you see beyond
the world we live in.

42:08.063 --> 42:10.632
There is a price to
be paid for that.

42:10.665 --> 42:12.233
Of course we'll help you.

42:23.178 --> 42:25.347
Everything's
changing, Robert.

42:25.380 --> 42:27.349
Having a child was
always going to change...

42:27.382 --> 42:31.486
No, the world, it's pivoting
in some new direction.

42:31.519 --> 42:33.922
It's reforming.

42:35.690 --> 42:37.392
This is your moment.

42:38.560 --> 42:40.237
We're putting together a
group to study feasibility...

42:40.261 --> 42:43.064
"We" shouldn't be doing
anything. You should.

42:43.965 --> 42:46.101
Lawrence won't get this done.

42:46.134 --> 42:48.269
Or Tolman or Rabi. You will.

42:57.112 --> 42:59.247
Who are the uniforms?

43:00.048 --> 43:01.950
I thought you might know.

43:02.984 --> 43:05.253
Dr. Oppenheimer.

43:05.286 --> 43:07.255
I'm Colonel Groves.

43:07.288 --> 43:09.524
This is Lieutenant
Colonel Nichols.

43:09.557 --> 43:11.059
Have that dry-cleaned.

43:16.965 --> 43:19.033
Well, if that's how you
treat Lieutenant Colonel,

43:19.067 --> 43:22.437
I'd hate to see how you
treat a humble physicist.

43:22.470 --> 43:24.539
Ah, if I ever meet
one, I'll let you know.

43:24.572 --> 43:26.074
Ouch.

43:26.107 --> 43:27.675
Theaters of combat
all over the world,

43:27.709 --> 43:29.644
but I have to stay
in Washington.

43:29.677 --> 43:32.380
- Why?
- I built the Pentagon.

43:32.414 --> 43:35.049
The brass likes it so much
they made me take over

43:35.083 --> 43:37.218
the Manhattan Engineer District.

43:37.252 --> 43:38.386
Which is?

43:38.420 --> 43:41.689
Oh, don't be a smart ass. You
know damn well what it is.

43:41.723 --> 43:43.425
You and half of every
physics department

43:43.458 --> 43:46.294
across the country.
That's problem number one.

43:46.327 --> 43:48.062
I thought problem
number one would be

43:48.096 --> 43:49.364
securing enough uranium ore.

43:49.397 --> 43:52.500
1,200 tons bought the
day I took charge.

43:52.534 --> 43:53.701
Processing?

43:53.735 --> 43:55.937
Just broke ground at
Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

43:56.738 --> 43:58.440
Now I'm looking for
a project director.

43:58.473 --> 44:00.575
And my name came up?

44:00.608 --> 44:01.676
Nope.

44:02.812 --> 44:05.046
Even though you brought
quantum physics to America.

44:05.079 --> 44:06.448
Which made me curious.

44:06.481 --> 44:08.349
What have you found out?

44:09.250 --> 44:11.753
You're a dilettante,
a womanizer,

44:11.786 --> 44:13.121
a suspected Communist...

44:13.154 --> 44:14.556
I'm a New Deal Democrat.

44:14.589 --> 44:16.191
I said "suspected."

44:16.224 --> 44:20.462
Unstable, theatrical,
egotistical, neurotic...

44:20.495 --> 44:21.529
Nothing good, no?

44:21.563 --> 44:23.231
Not even "he's
brilliant, but..."

44:23.264 --> 44:25.066
Well, brilliance is
taken for granted

44:25.099 --> 44:26.601
in your circle, so no.

44:26.634 --> 44:28.603
No, the only person who
had anything good to say

44:28.636 --> 44:30.371
was Richard Tolman.

44:30.405 --> 44:32.507
Tolman thinks you
have integrity,

44:32.540 --> 44:34.676
but he also strikes me as a guy

44:34.709 --> 44:37.078
who knows more about
science than people.

44:37.111 --> 44:41.082
Yet here you are. You
don't take much on trust.

44:41.115 --> 44:43.117
I don't take anything on trust.

44:46.688 --> 44:48.423
Why don't you have
a Nobel Prize?

44:48.456 --> 44:49.524
Why aren't you a general?

44:49.557 --> 44:50.734
They're making me one for this.

44:50.758 --> 44:52.126
Perhaps I'll have the same luck.

44:52.160 --> 44:53.761
A Nobel Prize for making a bomb?

44:53.795 --> 44:56.130
Alfred Nobel invented dynamite.

44:58.566 --> 45:00.201
So how would you proceed?

45:01.703 --> 45:04.405
You're talking
about turning theory

45:04.439 --> 45:06.608
into a practical weapons system

45:06.641 --> 45:07.775
faster than the Nazis.

45:07.810 --> 45:09.544
Who have a 12-month head start.

45:09.577 --> 45:10.712
Eighteen.

45:10.745 --> 45:12.113
How could you
possibly know that?

45:12.146 --> 45:14.182
Our fast neutron
research took six months.

45:14.215 --> 45:15.726
The man they've
undoubtedly put in charge

45:15.750 --> 45:17.151
will have made that
leap instantly.

45:17.185 --> 45:18.395
Who do you think
they put in charge?

45:18.419 --> 45:19.521
Werner Heisenberg.

45:19.554 --> 45:22.123
He has the most
intuitive understanding

45:22.156 --> 45:23.826
of atomic structure
I have ever seen.

45:23.859 --> 45:25.560
- You know his work?
- I know him.

45:25.593 --> 45:27.438
<i>Just like I know Walther
Bothe, von WeizsÃ¤cker, Diebner.</i>

45:27.462 --> 45:30.265
In a straight race,
the Germans win.

45:30.298 --> 45:33.034
- We've got one hope.
- Which is?

45:33.635 --> 45:35.270
Anti-Semitism.

45:36.404 --> 45:37.405
What?

45:37.438 --> 45:40.275
Hitler called quantum
physics "Jewish science."

45:40.308 --> 45:42.143
Said it right to
Einstein's face.

45:42.176 --> 45:45.413
Our one hope is that Hitler
is so... so blinded by hate

45:45.446 --> 45:47.248
that he's denied Heisenberg
proper resources,

45:47.282 --> 45:49.217
because it'll take
vast resources.

45:49.250 --> 45:50.795
Our nation's best
scientists working together.

45:50.819 --> 45:52.220
Right now, they're scattered.

45:52.253 --> 45:53.856
Which gives us
compartmentalization.

45:53.889 --> 45:55.757
All minds have to
see the whole task

45:55.790 --> 45:57.158
to contribute efficiently.

45:57.191 --> 45:59.427
Poor security may
cost us the race.

45:59.460 --> 46:01.296
Inefficiency will.

46:01.329 --> 46:03.164
The Germans know
more than us anyway.

46:03.197 --> 46:05.300
The Russians don't.

46:05.333 --> 46:09.270
Remind me, who are
we at war with?

46:09.304 --> 46:11.739
Somebody with your past
doesn't want to be seen

46:11.773 --> 46:13.374
downplaying the importance

46:13.408 --> 46:16.144
of security from our
Communist allies.

46:16.177 --> 46:18.847
Point taken. But, no.

46:18.881 --> 46:21.182
You don't
get to say "no" to me.

46:21.215 --> 46:23.484
It's my job to say "no"
to you when you're wrong.

46:23.518 --> 46:25.520
So you have the job now?

46:25.553 --> 46:27.622
Uh, I'm considering it.

46:30.325 --> 46:32.660
I'm starting to see where
you got your reputation.

46:33.862 --> 46:36.297
My favorite response,

46:36.331 --> 46:38.666
"Oppenheimer couldn't
run a hamburger stand."

46:40.635 --> 46:41.635
I couldn't.

46:43.471 --> 46:45.640
But I can run the
Manhattan Project.

46:46.507 --> 46:48.676
There's a way to
balance these things.

46:48.710 --> 46:52.915
Keep the Rad Lab here at
Berkeley under Lawrence.

46:52.948 --> 46:55.216
Met Lab in Chicago,
under Szilard.

46:55.249 --> 46:57.685
Large-scale refining, where
did you say? Tennessee.

46:57.719 --> 46:59.387
- And Hanford.
- And Hanford.

46:59.420 --> 47:03.491
All America's industrial might
and scientific innovation,

47:03.524 --> 47:04.893
connected by rail.

47:04.927 --> 47:06.594
Focused on one goal.

47:06.628 --> 47:09.330
One point in space and time.
And it comes together here.

47:09.364 --> 47:11.666
<i>A secret laboratory. In
the middle of nowhere,</i>

47:11.699 --> 47:13.167
<i>secure, self-sufficient,</i>

47:13.201 --> 47:14.569
equipment, housing, the works.

47:14.602 --> 47:16.771
Keep everyone there
until it's done.

47:16.805 --> 47:18.841
It'll need a school,
stores, a church.

47:18.874 --> 47:20.308
Why?

47:20.341 --> 47:21.652
<i>If we don't
let scientists</i>

47:21.676 --> 47:23.387
bring their families,
we'll never get the best.

47:23.411 --> 47:25.480
You want security, build
a town, build it fast.

47:25.513 --> 47:26.581
Where?

47:30.585 --> 47:32.553
Welcome to Los Alamos.

47:32.587 --> 47:35.390
Now, there's a boys school
we'll have to commandeer,

47:35.423 --> 47:37.401
and the local Indians come
up here for burial rites.

47:37.425 --> 47:40.662
But, apart from that, nothing.
Forty miles. Any direction.

47:40.695 --> 47:42.630
Enough to find the perfect spot.

47:42.664 --> 47:45.166
- For?
- Success.

47:50.438 --> 47:52.440
Build him a town. Fast.

47:53.474 --> 47:55.978
Let's go recruit
some scientists.

47:56.011 --> 47:58.346
Why would I leave my family?

47:58.379 --> 47:59.824
I told you, you can
bring your family.

47:59.848 --> 48:01.282
I'm not a soldier, Oppie.

48:01.315 --> 48:03.418
A soldier? He's a general.

48:03.451 --> 48:05.286
I've got all the soldier I need.

48:05.319 --> 48:06.889
What can I tell them?

48:06.922 --> 48:09.257
Heisenberg, Diebner,
Bothe and Bohr.

48:09.290 --> 48:10.591
What do these men
have in common?

48:10.625 --> 48:12.627
The greatest minds
on atomic theory.

48:12.660 --> 48:13.996
- Yes, and?
- Uh...

48:14.029 --> 48:17.298
As much as you like,

48:17.331 --> 48:19.467
until you feel my
boot on your balls.

48:19.500 --> 48:22.270
You know isotopes and
you know explosives

48:22.303 --> 48:23.604
better than anyone in the world.

48:23.638 --> 48:26.240
But you can't tell
us what you're doing?

48:29.310 --> 48:31.546
- I don't know.
- The Nazis have them.

48:31.579 --> 48:33.715
- Niels Bohr's in Copenhagen.
- Under Nazi occupation.

48:33.748 --> 48:35.616
Did they stop printing
newspapers in Princeton?

48:35.650 --> 48:37.986
Why would we go to
the middle of nowhere

48:38.020 --> 48:39.487
for who knows how
long?

48:39.520 --> 48:41.622
For a year or two. Or three.

48:42.623 --> 48:46.227
Uh, General, could
you give us a moment?

48:47.295 --> 48:50.364
It's about unleashing
the strong force...

48:51.499 --> 48:52.901
before the Nazis do.

48:52.935 --> 48:54.870
Oh, my God.

48:54.903 --> 48:56.014
Niels won't work for the Nazis.

48:56.038 --> 48:57.338
No, never.

48:57.371 --> 48:59.674
But while they
have him, we don't.

48:59.707 --> 49:00.876
That's why I need you.

49:00.909 --> 49:02.878
Why would you think I'd do that?

49:02.911 --> 49:04.746
"Why?" "Why?"

49:04.779 --> 49:06.991
How about because this is the
most important fucking thing

49:07.015 --> 49:09.017
to ever happen in the
history of the world.

49:09.051 --> 49:10.485
How about that?

49:11.053 --> 49:12.487
Fuck.

49:17.425 --> 49:19.794
They are not gonna let
me onto this project.

49:19.828 --> 49:21.897
And failing a security
check is not gonna be good

49:21.930 --> 49:23.598
for a career, even
after the war.

49:23.631 --> 49:26.400
So you're a fellow
traveler. So what?

49:26.434 --> 49:27.802
This is a national emergency.

49:27.836 --> 49:31.006
I've got some skeletons,
they put me in charge.

49:31.039 --> 49:32.340
They need us.

49:32.373 --> 49:34.542
Until they don't.

49:37.612 --> 49:40.015
Is there any chance of
getting Bohr out of Denmark?

49:40.048 --> 49:43.051
Nah, no dice. I checked
with the British.

49:43.085 --> 49:45.386
Until we get Allied boots
back onto the continent,

49:45.419 --> 49:46.822
there's just no way.

49:48.356 --> 49:49.791
Is he that important?

49:49.825 --> 49:52.861
How many people do you know
who proved Einstein wrong?

49:53.929 --> 49:56.031
You know, it really would
be quicker to take a plane.

49:56.064 --> 49:57.799
No, plane's too risky.

49:57.833 --> 50:00.301
Country needs us.

50:02.670 --> 50:03.771
The Harvard guys,

50:03.806 --> 50:06.374
they say the building's too
small for the cyclotron.

50:08.609 --> 50:10.511
Get them together
with the architects.

50:13.714 --> 50:15.716
When's this place
supposed to open?

50:18.821 --> 50:19.821
Two months.

50:20.755 --> 50:23.025
Robert, you're the
great improviser,

50:23.058 --> 50:25.093
but this...

50:25.127 --> 50:26.727
you can't do in your head.

50:27.762 --> 50:29.363
Four divisions.

50:30.498 --> 50:34.102
Experimental, Theoretical,
Metallurgical, Ordnance.

50:34.136 --> 50:35.103
Who's running Theoretical?

50:35.137 --> 50:36.537
I am.

50:36.571 --> 50:37.782
That's what
I was afraid of.

50:37.806 --> 50:39.674
You're spread too thin.

50:40.876 --> 50:42.577
So you take Theoretical.

50:45.147 --> 50:48.382
I'm not coming here, Robert.

50:54.022 --> 50:55.690
Why not?

51:01.562 --> 51:05.633
You drop a bomb and it falls
on the just and the unjust.

51:06.902 --> 51:09.537
I don't wish the culmination
of three centuries of physics

51:09.570 --> 51:11.974
to be a weapon of
mass destruction.

51:21.183 --> 51:22.516
Izzy.

51:23.651 --> 51:27.788
I don't know if we can be
trusted with such a weapon.

51:29.157 --> 51:32.460
But I know the Nazis can't.

51:35.864 --> 51:38.666
We have no choice.

51:40.068 --> 51:41.502
Then...

51:42.838 --> 51:45.207
the second thing you'll
have to do is appoint

51:45.240 --> 51:47.508
Hans Bethe to run the
Theoretical division.

51:49.878 --> 51:51.712
Wait, what was the first?

51:51.746 --> 51:54.216
Take off that
ridiculous uniform.

51:54.249 --> 51:55.449
You're a scientist.

51:55.483 --> 51:57.085
Groves is insisting we join.

51:57.119 --> 51:59.553
Tell Groves to go
shit in his hat.

51:59.587 --> 52:03.058
They need us for who
we are. So be yourself.

52:03.091 --> 52:05.060
Only better.

52:44.099 --> 52:46.134
This is the only key.

52:46.168 --> 52:47.601
And Teller's already here.

52:47.635 --> 52:49.503
Shall I just show him in?

52:49.537 --> 52:51.206
No, let's wait for the others.

52:59.147 --> 53:00.148
Let's get started.

53:00.182 --> 53:02.250
Hello, Edward.

53:02.284 --> 53:03.986
Yes.

53:04.019 --> 53:05.720
Gentlemen, so, we will work here

53:05.753 --> 53:08.756
until the T-section at
Los Alamos is finished.

53:08.789 --> 53:11.093
- Edward, can I please...
- It is more important.

53:13.161 --> 53:15.130
When I calculated
the chain reaction,

53:15.163 --> 53:17.866
I found a rather
troubling possibility.

53:17.899 --> 53:20.002
No.

53:20.035 --> 53:21.269
But this can't be right.

53:21.303 --> 53:23.238
Show me how you did
your calculations.

53:23.271 --> 53:24.672
Yes.

53:28.176 --> 53:29.244
It's exponential.

53:29.277 --> 53:31.746
No. No, no, no. No.

53:34.282 --> 53:36.284
This is fantasy.

53:36.318 --> 53:38.586
Teller's calculations
can't be right.

53:38.619 --> 53:41.289
Do them yourself while
I go to Princeton.

53:41.323 --> 53:43.158
- What for?
- To talk to Einstein.

53:43.191 --> 53:45.760
Well, there's not much common
ground between you two.

53:45.793 --> 53:48.830
That's why I should
get his view.

53:52.267 --> 53:54.269
- Albert.
- Hmm?

53:54.302 --> 53:57.205
Ah. Dr. Oppenheimer.

53:57.239 --> 53:58.706
Well, have you met Dr. GÃ¶del?

53:58.739 --> 54:00.308
We walk here most days.

54:00.342 --> 54:05.147
Trees are the most
inspiring structures.

54:05.180 --> 54:06.647
Albert, might I have a word?

54:06.680 --> 54:10.085
Of course. 'Scuse me, Kurt.

54:11.086 --> 54:14.022
You know, some days,
Kurt refuses to eat.

54:14.056 --> 54:15.656
Even in Princeton.

54:15.689 --> 54:18.793
He's convinced that the
Nazis can poison his food.

54:18.827 --> 54:20.095
Mm.

54:20.128 --> 54:21.963
Hmm? Huh.

54:23.832 --> 54:25.666
Wha...

54:30.205 --> 54:33.041
Whose... Whose work is this?

54:33.075 --> 54:34.109
Teller's.

54:35.243 --> 54:37.711
What do you take it to mean?

54:37.745 --> 54:39.680
Neutrons smash into nucleus,

54:39.713 --> 54:43.751
releasing neutrons to
smash into other nuclei.

54:43.784 --> 54:45.987
Criticality, a
point of no return,

54:46.021 --> 54:47.621
massive explosive force.

54:47.655 --> 54:49.991
But this time, the chain
reaction doesn't stop.

54:50.892 --> 54:53.862
It would ignite the atmosphere.

54:54.930 --> 54:56.898
When we detonate
an atomic device,

54:56.932 --> 54:59.101
we might start a
chain reaction that...

55:00.068 --> 55:01.602
destroys the world.

55:02.770 --> 55:04.672
So here we are, hmm?

55:04.705 --> 55:09.010
Lost in your quantum
world of probabilities

55:09.044 --> 55:10.778
and needing certainty.

55:10.812 --> 55:13.681
Can you run the
calculations yourself?

55:13.714 --> 55:15.117
About the only thing

55:15.150 --> 55:18.420
you and I have in common is
a disdain for mathematics.

55:18.453 --> 55:21.022
Who's working on
this in-in Berkeley?

55:21.056 --> 55:22.357
Hans Bethe.

55:22.390 --> 55:24.226
Well, he'll get to the truth.

55:25.861 --> 55:28.729
And if the truth
is catastrophic?

55:28.762 --> 55:30.065
Then you stop.

55:30.098 --> 55:33.835
And you share your
findings with the Nazis.

55:33.869 --> 55:37.005
So neither side
destroys the world.

55:40.208 --> 55:41.243
Robert.

55:42.710 --> 55:45.914
This is yours, not mine.

55:58.792 --> 56:00.195
Teller's wrong.

56:00.228 --> 56:01.429
He's wrong.

56:11.106 --> 56:13.808
When you know Teller's
critical assumptions,

56:13.842 --> 56:15.177
the real picture emerges.

56:15.210 --> 56:17.012
Bottom line?

56:17.045 --> 56:19.147
The chances of an
uncontrolled nuclear reaction

56:19.181 --> 56:20.182
are near zero.

56:20.215 --> 56:22.851
Near zero.

56:22.884 --> 56:25.153
- Oppie, this is good news.
- Mm.

56:26.488 --> 56:27.721
Can you run them again?

56:27.755 --> 56:29.491
No, you'll get the same answer.

56:29.524 --> 56:31.102
Till they actually detonate
one of these things,

56:31.126 --> 56:33.962
the best assurance you're
going to get is this.

56:33.995 --> 56:35.063
Near zero.

56:37.265 --> 56:39.935
Theory
will take you only so far.

56:39.968 --> 56:41.469
- Mm.
<i>- Hello!</i>

56:41.503 --> 56:42.813
- Hello, you.
- Hi.

56:42.837 --> 56:44.172
We missed him.

56:44.206 --> 56:45.340
You want to adopt?

56:45.373 --> 56:46.774
She's kidding.

56:46.808 --> 56:48.742
We wanted to see
you before we left.

56:48.776 --> 56:51.947
For parts unknown.

56:51.980 --> 56:54.516
You know who
I ran into the other day?

56:54.549 --> 56:56.184
Eltenton.

56:56.218 --> 56:57.485
Oh.

56:57.519 --> 56:59.221
The chemist from
Shell? The union guy?

56:59.254 --> 57:03.124
Yeah. He...
The, uh, F.A.E.C.T. guy.

57:03.158 --> 57:06.528
He was moaning about how
we're handling the war.

57:06.561 --> 57:08.762
How so?

57:08.796 --> 57:11.533
Lack of cooperation
with our allies.

57:11.566 --> 57:13.902
Apparently our
government's not sharing

57:13.935 --> 57:16.037
any research with the Russians.

57:16.071 --> 57:17.038
Well, he said,

57:17.072 --> 57:19.808
"Most scientists think
the policy is stupid."

57:23.144 --> 57:24.980
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

57:25.013 --> 57:27.382
He mentioned that if anyone

57:27.415 --> 57:30.385
had anything they
wanted to pass on,

57:30.418 --> 57:32.254
uh, going around
official channels,

57:32.287 --> 57:34.222
that he could help.

57:42.864 --> 57:44.532
That would be treason.

57:44.566 --> 57:47.402
Yes, of course.

57:47.435 --> 57:49.237
I just thought you should know.

57:52.374 --> 57:53.842
The brat is down.

57:53.875 --> 57:55.243
Where are the martinis?

58:00.448 --> 58:01.950
Coming right up.

58:01.983 --> 58:03.451
<i>Conversation ended there.</i>

58:03.485 --> 58:05.587
Nothing in our
long-standing friendship

58:05.620 --> 58:07.188
would have led me to believe

58:07.222 --> 58:09.958
that Chevalier was actually
seeking information,

58:09.991 --> 58:12.460
and I am certain
that he had no idea

58:12.494 --> 58:14.795
of the work in
which I was engaged.

58:19.334 --> 58:21.303
It has long been clear to me

58:21.336 --> 58:24.039
that I should have reported
this incident at once.

58:24.072 --> 58:25.583
<i>The
Oppenheimer situation</i>

58:25.607 --> 58:28.510
<i>highlights the tension
between scientists</i>

58:28.543 --> 58:30.145
and the security apparatus.

58:30.178 --> 58:32.047
In hopes of learning
how the nominee handled

58:32.080 --> 58:34.416
such issues during
his time at the AEC,

58:34.449 --> 58:37.952
we'll have a scientist
appearing before the committee.

58:38.620 --> 58:40.188
Who are they bringing in?

58:40.221 --> 58:41.189
They hadn't said.

58:41.222 --> 58:42.590
Mr. Chairman,
if I may,

58:42.624 --> 58:45.160
I'm nominated for
Commerce Secretary.

58:45.193 --> 58:47.495
Why seek the opinion
of scientists?

58:47.529 --> 58:49.864
This is a Cabinet post, Admiral.

58:49.898 --> 58:52.067
We seek a wide range of opinion.

58:52.100 --> 58:54.903
Well, I'd like to know the name
of the scientist testifying.

58:54.936 --> 58:56.438
I'd like the chance
to cross-examine.

58:56.471 --> 58:58.606
This is not a court.

58:58.640 --> 59:01.042
Formality, huh?

59:01.076 --> 59:02.353
No
presidential Cabinet nominee

59:02.377 --> 59:04.946
has failed to be
confirmed since 1925.

59:04.979 --> 59:07.082
This is just how
the game is played.

59:07.115 --> 59:08.416
It's in the bag, Lewis.

59:08.450 --> 59:09.651
So play nice.

59:09.684 --> 59:11.953
<i>They bring in a
scientist, so what?</i>

59:11.986 --> 59:13.988
You don't know scientists
like I do, Counselor.

59:14.022 --> 59:16.057
They resent anyone who
questions their judgment,

59:16.091 --> 59:18.093
<i>especially if you're
not one of them.</i>

59:18.126 --> 59:19.427
I was chair of the AEC.

59:19.461 --> 59:21.896
I'm easy to blame for
what happened to Robert.

59:21.930 --> 59:23.231
We can't have the
Senate thinking

59:23.264 --> 59:26.368
the scientific community
doesn't support you, sir.

59:26.401 --> 59:28.236
Or should we pivot?

59:28.269 --> 59:30.238
- To what?
- And embrace it.

59:30.271 --> 59:33.041
"I fought Oppenheimer,
and the US won."

59:33.074 --> 59:34.642
I-I don't think we
need to go there.

59:34.676 --> 59:36.954
Isn't there someone we can call
who knows what really happened?

59:36.978 --> 59:38.418
- Teller.
- He'll make an impression.

59:38.446 --> 59:40.524
Can you get the name of the
scientist they've called?

59:40.548 --> 59:42.117
- Probably.
- Find out if he was

59:42.150 --> 59:44.519
based in Chicago or Los
Alamos during the war.

59:44.552 --> 59:45.920
Why does that matter?

59:45.954 --> 59:47.164
Well, if he was
based in Chicago,

59:47.188 --> 59:48.599
then he worked under
Szilard and Fermi,

59:48.623 --> 59:50.925
not the cult of
Oppie at Los Alamos.

59:50.959 --> 59:52.193
Robert built that damn place.

59:52.227 --> 59:54.996
He was founder, mayor, sheriff,

59:55.029 --> 59:56.431
all rolled into one.

01:00:09.377 --> 01:00:11.179
All it needs is a saloon.

01:00:39.607 --> 01:00:42.177
There's no kitchen.

01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:46.147
Really? We'll fix that.

01:00:52.053 --> 01:00:55.457
Barbed wire, guns.

01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:56.591
Oppie.

01:00:56.624 --> 01:00:58.259
We're at war, Hans.

01:01:00.662 --> 01:01:03.231
Halifax. 1917.

01:01:03.264 --> 01:01:06.234
A cargo ship carrying munitions
explodes in the harbor.

01:01:08.636 --> 01:01:11.573
A vast and sudden
chemical reaction.

01:01:15.243 --> 01:01:18.079
The biggest man-made
explosion in history.

01:01:18.112 --> 01:01:20.081
Now let's calculate how
much more destructive

01:01:20.114 --> 01:01:22.784
it would have been
if it were a nuclear

01:01:22.818 --> 01:01:24.486
and not a chemical reaction.

01:01:24.519 --> 01:01:28.156
Expressing power in
terms of tons of TNT.

01:01:28.189 --> 01:01:29.691
But it will be thousands.

01:01:29.724 --> 01:01:33.161
Well, then kilotons.

01:01:36.731 --> 01:01:40.101
Using U-235,

01:01:40.134 --> 01:01:42.704
- the bomb will need a...
- Uh-uh.

01:01:42.737 --> 01:01:45.808
Sorry. Gadget will
need a 33-pound sphere

01:01:45.841 --> 01:01:47.308
about this size.

01:01:47.342 --> 01:01:51.145
Or using plutonium,
the ten-pound sphere.

01:01:52.547 --> 01:01:53.781
Here's the amount of uranium

01:01:53.816 --> 01:01:57.151
Oak Ridge refined
all of last month.

01:01:59.554 --> 01:02:03.558
And the Hanford plant
made this much plutonium.

01:02:04.692 --> 01:02:07.795
Now, if we can
enrich these amounts,

01:02:07.830 --> 01:02:10.632
we need a way to detonate them.

01:02:10.665 --> 01:02:12.767
Are we boring you, Edward?

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.402
A little bit, yes.

01:02:14.435 --> 01:02:15.670
May I ask why?

01:02:15.703 --> 01:02:17.138
We all
entered this room

01:02:17.171 --> 01:02:19.107
knowing a fission
bomb was possible.

01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.743
How 'bout we leave it
with something new?

01:02:21.776 --> 01:02:22.777
Such as?

01:02:22.811 --> 01:02:25.547
Instead of uranium or plutonium,

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:26.581
we use hydrogen.

01:02:28.149 --> 01:02:29.760
- Heavy hydrogen.
- Hydrogen.

01:02:29.784 --> 01:02:32.554
Deuterium. You see?

01:02:32.587 --> 01:02:34.289
We compact the atoms together

01:02:34.322 --> 01:02:37.392
under great pressure to
induce a fusion reaction.

01:02:38.326 --> 01:02:41.162
Then we'll get not kilotons,

01:02:41.195 --> 01:02:42.263
but megatons.

01:02:42.297 --> 01:02:43.231
A big
fission reaction...

01:02:43.264 --> 01:02:44.833
Okay, hang on, hang on.

01:02:44.867 --> 01:02:49.571
So how do you generate enough
force to fuse hydrogen atoms?

01:02:49.604 --> 01:02:51.673
A small fission bomb.

01:02:51.706 --> 01:02:53.408
There we are.

01:02:55.343 --> 01:02:57.145
Well, since we're going
to need one anyway,

01:02:57.178 --> 01:02:59.147
can we get back to
the business at hand?

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:00.524
The isotopes issue

01:03:00.548 --> 01:03:04.185
wasn't your most important
policy disagreement

01:03:04.218 --> 01:03:05.854
with Dr. Oppenheimer.

01:03:05.888 --> 01:03:08.289
It was the hydrogen
bomb, wasn't it?

01:03:08.323 --> 01:03:11.192
Uh, as colleagues,
we agreed to disagree

01:03:11.225 --> 01:03:13.227
on a great many things, uh,

01:03:13.261 --> 01:03:14.495
and, well, one of them

01:03:14.529 --> 01:03:17.599
was the need for an
H-bomb program, yes.

01:03:30.445 --> 01:03:33.214
Thanks for convening
on short notice.

01:03:33.247 --> 01:03:34.716
I can't believe it.

01:03:35.717 --> 01:03:37.251
Well, here we are.

01:03:37.285 --> 01:03:39.287
Catch me up. What do we know?

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.824
One of our B-29s over
the North Pacific

01:03:41.857 --> 01:03:43.358
has detected radiation.

01:03:43.391 --> 01:03:45.159
Do we have the filter papers?

01:03:45.193 --> 01:03:47.195
There's no doubt what this is.

01:03:47.228 --> 01:03:48.439
White House says
there's a doubt.

01:03:48.463 --> 01:03:49.898
Wishful thinking, I'm afraid.

01:03:49.932 --> 01:03:52.634
Are those the long-range
detection filter papers?

01:03:53.568 --> 01:03:55.637
It's an atomic test.

01:03:58.272 --> 01:03:59.674
The Russians have a bomb.

01:03:59.707 --> 01:04:03.444
We're supposed to be years
ahead of them, but some...

01:04:03.478 --> 01:04:05.780
What were you guys
doing at Los Alamos?

01:04:05.814 --> 01:04:06.949
Wasn't security tight?

01:04:06.982 --> 01:04:08.483
Of course it was.
You weren't there.

01:04:08.516 --> 01:04:10.919
- It was...
- Forgive me, Doctor...

01:04:10.953 --> 01:04:13.388
but I was there.

01:04:14.455 --> 01:04:15.790
We can now consider

01:04:15.824 --> 01:04:17.759
the actual mechanics
of detonation.

01:04:17.792 --> 01:04:18.927
Any ideas?

01:04:18.961 --> 01:04:20.695
I call
this "shooting."

01:04:20.728 --> 01:04:24.265
We fire a chunk of fissionable
material into a larger sphere

01:04:24.298 --> 01:04:26.801
with enough force to
achieve criticality.

01:04:26.835 --> 01:04:28.503
What do we think? Anyone?

01:04:28.536 --> 01:04:30.338
I've been
thinking about implosion.

01:04:30.371 --> 01:04:32.340
Explosives around the
sphere blast inwards,

01:04:32.373 --> 01:04:34.409
crushing the material.

01:04:34.442 --> 01:04:36.377
I'd like to
investigate that idea.

01:04:36.411 --> 01:04:38.713
I'll talk to Ordnance,
get you blowing things up.

01:04:39.714 --> 01:04:40.816
Progress?

01:04:40.849 --> 01:04:42.684
Nice to see you too.

01:04:42.717 --> 01:04:44.485
Meet the British contingent.

01:04:44.519 --> 01:04:46.354
Dr. Oppenheimer, Klaus Fuchs.

01:04:46.387 --> 01:04:48.256
How long have you been British?

01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:49.500
Since Hitler told
me I wasn't German.

01:04:49.524 --> 01:04:53.327
Uh-huh. Come, welcome
to Los Alamos.

01:04:53.361 --> 01:04:55.229
School's up and running.

01:04:55.263 --> 01:04:57.565
Bar. Always running.

01:04:57.598 --> 01:05:00.601
And I thought of a way
to reduce support staff.

01:05:01.569 --> 01:05:03.571
- Is that...
- Mrs. Serber, yes.

01:05:03.604 --> 01:05:05.007
I've offered jobs
to all the wives.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.507
Admin, librarians, computation.

01:05:06.541 --> 01:05:08.844
We cut down on staff,
keep families together.

01:05:08.877 --> 01:05:11.446
- Are these women qualified?
- Don't be absurd.

01:05:11.479 --> 01:05:13.849
These are some of the brightest
minds in our community.

01:05:13.882 --> 01:05:15.450
And they're already
security cleared.

01:05:15.483 --> 01:05:17.361
I've informed General
Groves you've been holding

01:05:17.385 --> 01:05:18.854
cross-divisional
open discussions

01:05:18.887 --> 01:05:20.588
- on a nightly basis.
- Shut them down.

01:05:20.621 --> 01:05:22.958
Compartmentalization is the
key to maintaining security...

01:05:22.991 --> 01:05:24.492
It's only the top men.

01:05:24.525 --> 01:05:26.360
Who presumably communicate
with subordinates.

01:05:26.394 --> 01:05:27.595
These men aren't stupid.

01:05:27.628 --> 01:05:29.464
- They can be discreet.
- I don't like it.

01:05:29.497 --> 01:05:32.400
You don't like anything enough
for that to be a fair test.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:40.475
Once a week. Top men only.

01:05:40.508 --> 01:05:41.877
I'd like to bring
my brother here.

01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:43.377
No.

01:05:44.012 --> 01:05:45.780
Uh, Nichols...

01:05:46.915 --> 01:05:48.851
I still haven't heard
that my security clearance

01:05:48.884 --> 01:05:50.451
- has been approved.
- It hasn't.

01:05:50.485 --> 01:05:51.854
We're going to Chicago tomorrow.

01:05:51.887 --> 01:05:52.921
No, you should wait.

01:05:54.123 --> 01:05:55.232
You are aware that the Nazis
have a two-year head start.

01:05:55.256 --> 01:05:58.326
Dr. Oppenheimer, the fact
that your security clearance

01:05:58.359 --> 01:06:00.361
is proving difficult to
obtain is not my fault.

01:06:00.394 --> 01:06:01.662
It's yours.

01:06:01.696 --> 01:06:03.631
May not be your fault,
but it's your problem.

01:06:03.664 --> 01:06:04.665
Because I'm going.

01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:08.469
And how many
people were in these, uh,

01:06:08.503 --> 01:06:10.705
- open discussions?
- Too many.

01:06:10.738 --> 01:06:12.083
Compartmentalization was
supposed to be the protocol.

01:06:12.107 --> 01:06:14.042
We were in a race
against the Nazis.

01:06:14.076 --> 01:06:16.511
And now the race is
against the Soviets.

01:06:16.544 --> 01:06:18.056
- Not unless we start it.
- Robert.

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:21.482
They just fired a starting gun.

01:06:21.516 --> 01:06:23.484
What's the nature of the
device they detonated?

01:06:23.518 --> 01:06:25.063
The data
indicates it may have been

01:06:25.087 --> 01:06:27.388
a plutonium implosion device.

01:06:27.421 --> 01:06:30.525
Like the one you
built at Los Alamos.

01:06:30.558 --> 01:06:32.393
The Russians have a bomb,

01:06:32.426 --> 01:06:33.704
Truman needs to
know what's next.

01:06:33.728 --> 01:06:35.530
What's next? Arms talks.

01:06:35.563 --> 01:06:37.431
- Arms talks.
- Obviously.

01:06:38.366 --> 01:06:39.567
What about the Super?

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.335
Does Truman even know about it?

01:06:41.369 --> 01:06:43.371
Did we brief him on that?

01:06:43.404 --> 01:06:44.472
Not specifically.

01:06:44.505 --> 01:06:45.808
We still don't know

01:06:45.841 --> 01:06:47.608
if a hydrogen bomb's
technically feasible.

01:06:47.642 --> 01:06:49.553
Right, my understanding is
that Teller proposed it?

01:06:49.577 --> 01:06:51.412
- Yes.
- At Los Alamos?

01:06:51.445 --> 01:06:53.091
Teller's designs have always
been wildly impractical.

01:06:53.115 --> 01:06:55.449
You'd have to
deliver by ox cart.

01:06:55.483 --> 01:06:56.760
- Not airplane.
- Oppie.

01:06:56.784 --> 01:07:00.488
I'm sorry, Dr. Lawrence,
you want to comment?

01:07:01.722 --> 01:07:02.825
No.

01:07:04.692 --> 01:07:06.962
Because if it can
put us ahead again,

01:07:06.995 --> 01:07:10.032
the President of
the United States

01:07:10.065 --> 01:07:12.067
needs to know about it.

01:07:13.601 --> 01:07:15.403
And if the Russians
know about it already,

01:07:15.436 --> 01:07:18.439
from a spy at Los Alamos,

01:07:18.472 --> 01:07:19.774
then we've gotta get going.

01:07:19.808 --> 01:07:22.777
There's no proof there
was a spy at Los Alamos.

01:07:22.811 --> 01:07:23.879
Robert.

01:07:28.716 --> 01:07:30.484
They put it under
the football stadium?

01:07:30.518 --> 01:07:32.453
The field's not in use anymore.

01:07:32.486 --> 01:07:34.722
Just as well.

01:07:36.024 --> 01:07:38.459
- Oppie.
- Dr. Fermi.

01:07:41.163 --> 01:07:42.496
I hear you got a little town.

01:07:42.530 --> 01:07:43.764
Yes. Come and see.

01:07:45.499 --> 01:07:49.604
Who could think straight
in a place like that? Huh?

01:07:49.637 --> 01:07:51.572
Everybody will go crazy.

01:07:51.606 --> 01:07:55.476
Thank you for the vote
of confidence, Szilard.

01:07:55.509 --> 01:07:59.147
Do we really... do we really
need that in the notes?

01:07:59.181 --> 01:08:01.616
When are you going
to try it out?

01:08:01.649 --> 01:08:02.683
We did.

01:08:02.717 --> 01:08:07.089
The first self-sustaining
nuclear chain reaction.

01:08:07.122 --> 01:08:08.756
Didn't Groves tell you?

01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:10.424
No.

01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:18.033
One at a time,
please, one at a time.

01:08:18.066 --> 01:08:19.533
Dr. Oppenheimer?

01:08:20.635 --> 01:08:23.104
I tried Personnel. They
asked if I could type.

01:08:23.138 --> 01:08:24.438
Can you?

01:08:24.471 --> 01:08:25.606
Harvard forgot to teach that

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:27.475
on the graduate
chemistry course.

01:08:28.844 --> 01:08:31.746
Condon, put Mrs. Hornig
here on the plutonium team.

01:08:37.518 --> 01:08:39.187
What the hell were
you doing in Chicago?

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:40.688
Visiting the Met?

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:41.732
- Why? Why?
- Well, you can't talk to...

01:08:41.756 --> 01:08:43.791
Because we have every right...

01:08:43.825 --> 01:08:46.161
You have just the
rights that I give you.

01:08:46.194 --> 01:08:47.662
No more, no less.

01:08:47.694 --> 01:08:50.131
We are adults trying
to run a project here.

01:08:50.165 --> 01:08:51.867
This is ridiculous.

01:08:51.899 --> 01:08:53.667
Tell him.

01:08:53.701 --> 01:08:56.837
Compartmentalization is
the protocol we agreed to.

01:08:57.973 --> 01:08:59.207
Enough of this madhouse.

01:08:59.241 --> 01:09:01.609
Nobody can work under
these conditions.

01:09:01.642 --> 01:09:06.081
You know what,
Generalissimo? I quit.

01:09:06.113 --> 01:09:07.515
Thanks for nothing.

01:09:09.617 --> 01:09:11.118
Better
off without him.

01:09:12.553 --> 01:09:13.587
Aren't you more concerned

01:09:13.621 --> 01:09:15.991
about his discretion out there?

01:09:16.024 --> 01:09:18.426
We'll have him killed.

01:09:19.261 --> 01:09:21.830
I was just kidding.

01:09:21.863 --> 01:09:24.799
- No, he hates me, not America.
- You know, General,

01:09:24.832 --> 01:09:27.169
not everyone has levers
to pull like mine.

01:09:27.202 --> 01:09:29.037
I don't think I understand.

01:09:29.071 --> 01:09:31.238
You didn't hire me
despite my left-wing past.

01:09:31.273 --> 01:09:33.008
You hired me because of it.

01:09:34.009 --> 01:09:35.978
So you could control me.

01:09:36.011 --> 01:09:38.612
Well, I'm not that subtle.

01:09:38.645 --> 01:09:40.680
I'm just a humble soldier.

01:09:40.715 --> 01:09:42.225
You're neither humble
nor just a soldier.

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:43.261
You studied engineering at MIT.

01:09:43.285 --> 01:09:45.120
Guilty as charged.

01:09:45.153 --> 01:09:46.654
Well, now we
understand each other,

01:09:46.687 --> 01:09:48.131
perhaps you can get me
my security clearance

01:09:48.156 --> 01:09:50.959
so I can perform
this miracle for you.

01:09:55.864 --> 01:09:57.607
<i>General
Groves, were you aware</i>

01:09:57.631 --> 01:09:59.935
<i>of Dr. Oppenheimer's
left-wing associations</i>

01:09:59.968 --> 01:10:01.635
<i>when you appointed him?</i>

01:10:01.669 --> 01:10:03.314
I was aware that there
were suspicions about him.

01:10:03.338 --> 01:10:05.207
I was aware he
had a very extreme

01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.607
liberal background.

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:08.252
In your opinion, would
he ever consciously

01:10:08.276 --> 01:10:09.577
commit a disloyal act?

01:10:09.610 --> 01:10:11.213
I would be amazed if he did.

01:10:11.246 --> 01:10:14.316
So you had complete
confidence in his integrity.

01:10:14.349 --> 01:10:15.750
At Los Alamos, yes,

01:10:15.783 --> 01:10:17.119
which is where I
really knew him.

01:10:17.152 --> 01:10:19.121
General, did your
security officers

01:10:19.154 --> 01:10:20.621
on the project advise you

01:10:20.654 --> 01:10:22.133
against the clearance
of Dr. Oppenheimer?

01:10:22.157 --> 01:10:25.961
They could not and would not
clear him until I insisted.

01:10:25.994 --> 01:10:28.629
And it's safe to say that you
had a pretty good knowledge

01:10:28.662 --> 01:10:29.907
of Dr. Oppenheimer's
security file.

01:10:29.931 --> 01:10:31.599
I did.

01:10:31.632 --> 01:10:32.810
Well, then there's only
really one question

01:10:32.834 --> 01:10:34.302
I need answered here today.

01:10:34.336 --> 01:10:36.038
In light of the
current AEC guidelines,

01:10:36.071 --> 01:10:38.773
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

01:10:38.807 --> 01:10:40.876
Do you have the guidelines?

01:10:47.949 --> 01:10:50.618
Under current
AEC guidelines,

01:10:50.651 --> 01:10:52.686
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:08.702
Physics and New
Mexico, huh?

01:11:08.736 --> 01:11:11.772
My God. What a trek.

01:11:11.807 --> 01:11:13.275
That's why you need a liaison.

01:11:13.308 --> 01:11:14.843
I'm appointing Lomanitz.

01:11:16.011 --> 01:11:17.079
You're gonna be okay.

01:11:17.112 --> 01:11:18.280
This way, gentlemen.

01:11:28.256 --> 01:11:30.092
- Dr. Lawrence.
- Leslie.

01:11:30.125 --> 01:11:32.693
I'd like to remind you what
we talked about in Berkeley.

01:11:32.726 --> 01:11:35.063
Compartmentalization. I
understand completely.

01:11:38.233 --> 01:11:39.234
Okay.

01:11:40.402 --> 01:11:41.837
Thank you.

01:11:49.743 --> 01:11:50.988
<i>Greetings
from Berkeley.</i>

01:11:51.012 --> 01:11:53.148
I am here to update
you on our progress

01:11:53.181 --> 01:11:54.715
and solicit your input.

01:11:54.748 --> 01:11:56.127
To do so, I am going
to have to share

01:11:56.151 --> 01:11:59.821
a few things that General
Groves told me not to.

01:11:59.855 --> 01:12:01.655
Sorry, General, I
said I understood,

01:12:01.689 --> 01:12:02.756
not that I agreed.

01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:04.326
'Kay.

01:12:04.359 --> 01:12:06.394
Gentlemen, to business.

01:12:06.428 --> 01:12:08.796
There were rumors of
espionage at Los Alamos.

01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:10.308
Unsubstantiated.
Unsubstantiated.

01:12:10.332 --> 01:12:11.799
I'm told

01:12:11.833 --> 01:12:13.144
that there were
Communists on the project.

01:12:13.168 --> 01:12:14.936
We didn't knowingly
employ any Communists.

01:12:14.970 --> 01:12:16.746
I just want to know,
were any of them involved

01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:18.240
in discussions of the Super?

01:12:18.273 --> 01:12:20.451
I seem to remember you demanding
your brother come to Los Alamos.

01:12:20.475 --> 01:12:22.743
My brother had left
the Party by then.

01:12:22.776 --> 01:12:24.012
What about Lomanitz?

01:12:24.045 --> 01:12:25.779
Lomanitz was never
employed at Los Alamos.

01:12:25.814 --> 01:12:26.815
He was a liaison.

01:12:26.848 --> 01:12:28.016
Our security was tight,

01:12:28.049 --> 01:12:29.427
as former Colonel
Nichols well knows.

01:12:29.451 --> 01:12:31.019
Our security was as
tight as it could be

01:12:31.052 --> 01:12:32.420
given the
personalities involved,

01:12:32.454 --> 01:12:34.289
but attempts were made.

01:12:34.322 --> 01:12:35.333
What is that supposed to mean?

01:12:35.357 --> 01:12:36.925
We've all read his file here.

01:12:37.959 --> 01:12:39.961
Do we need to talk
about Jean Tatlock?

01:12:40.495 --> 01:12:42.663
Or the Chevalier incident?

01:12:47.269 --> 01:12:48.669
'Scuse me.

01:12:51.973 --> 01:12:53.942
That's
Lomanitz, line one.

01:12:59.814 --> 01:13:00.849
Hello, Rossi.

01:13:00.882 --> 01:13:04.085
<i>What? O-Okay, just calm down.</i>

01:13:05.053 --> 01:13:08.290
There's been another screw-up.
Lomanitz just got drafted.

01:13:08.323 --> 01:13:10.791
- We are at war, Doctor.
- Don't be an asshole, Nichols.

01:13:10.825 --> 01:13:12.827
We need this kid.
Fix it, will you?

01:13:12.861 --> 01:13:14.062
It wasn't a mistake.

01:13:14.095 --> 01:13:15.439
Your friend Lomanitz
has been trying

01:13:15.463 --> 01:13:17.731
to unionize the Radiation Lab.

01:13:17.765 --> 01:13:19.067
He promised to quit all that.

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.002
Well, he hasn't.

01:13:21.036 --> 01:13:22.904
Security officer at
Berkeley's concerned about

01:13:22.938 --> 01:13:25.240
Communist infiltration
through that union,

01:13:25.273 --> 01:13:27.876
- the F.A...
- F.A.E.C.T.

01:13:30.278 --> 01:13:33.982
While I'm there next week,
I'll drop in to see him.

01:13:36.251 --> 01:13:37.986
Your Q clearance came through.

01:13:41.523 --> 01:13:42.967
It's important you
not maintain or renew

01:13:42.991 --> 01:13:45.260
any questionable associations.

01:13:49.998 --> 01:13:52.500
<i>Doctor, did you
think social contacts</i>

01:13:52.534 --> 01:13:54.869
between a person engaged
on secret war work

01:13:54.903 --> 01:13:56.271
and Communists was dangerous?

01:13:56.304 --> 01:13:59.975
My awareness of the danger
would be greater today.

01:14:00.008 --> 01:14:02.911
I mean, it's fair to say
that during the war years,

01:14:02.944 --> 01:14:06.147
<i>you felt that such contacts
were potentially dangerous.</i>

01:14:12.587 --> 01:14:15.557
<i>Were conceivably
dangerous, yes.</i>

01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:17.859
<i>I mean, really,</i>

01:14:17.892 --> 01:14:19.928
<i>known Communists.</i>

01:14:22.063 --> 01:14:24.299
<i>Look...</i>

01:14:24.332 --> 01:14:25.867
I've had a lot of secrets

01:14:25.900 --> 01:14:28.870
<i>in my head for a long time.</i>

01:14:29.838 --> 01:14:31.115
<i>Doesn't matter who
I associate with.</i>

01:14:31.139 --> 01:14:34.042
I don't talk about
those secrets.

01:14:41.449 --> 01:14:43.084
You said
in your statement

01:14:43.118 --> 01:14:49.057
that you had to see
Jean Tatlock in 1943.

01:14:50.525 --> 01:14:52.193
You left.

01:14:53.428 --> 01:14:54.863
Not a word.

01:14:54.896 --> 01:14:57.365
What did you think
that would do to me?

01:14:58.466 --> 01:14:59.534
I wrote.

01:14:59.567 --> 01:15:01.970
Pages of nothing.

01:15:04.239 --> 01:15:06.574
Where did you go?

01:15:06.608 --> 01:15:09.044
- I can't tell you.
- Why not?

01:15:09.077 --> 01:15:11.813
Because you're a Communist.

01:15:13.348 --> 01:15:15.216
Why did you have to see her?

01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:18.353
Because she had
indicated a great desire

01:15:18.386 --> 01:15:20.055
to see me before we left.

01:15:20.088 --> 01:15:21.256
At that time, I couldn't,

01:15:21.289 --> 01:15:25.093
but I felt that
she had to see me.

01:15:25.126 --> 01:15:27.629
She was undergoing
psychiatric treatment.

01:15:27.662 --> 01:15:29.898
She was extremely unhappy.

01:15:29.931 --> 01:15:31.933
Did you find out why
she had to see you?

01:15:37.038 --> 01:15:39.107
Because she was still
in love with me.

01:15:46.314 --> 01:15:48.383
Spent the night
together, didn't you?

01:15:56.358 --> 01:15:57.392
Yes.

01:16:03.064 --> 01:16:06.935
You drop in and out of my life,

01:16:06.968 --> 01:16:09.437
and you don't have
to tell me why.

01:16:09.471 --> 01:16:10.939
Now that's power.

01:16:10.972 --> 01:16:13.007
Not that I enjoy.

01:16:13.975 --> 01:16:16.111
I'd rather be here
for you as you need.

01:16:16.144 --> 01:16:18.613
But you have other
priorities now.

01:16:18.646 --> 01:16:21.416
I have a wife and child.

01:16:22.417 --> 01:16:25.220
That's not what either
of us is talking about.

01:16:28.656 --> 01:16:30.525
Jean.

01:16:30.558 --> 01:16:32.694
You asked me to come.

01:16:32.727 --> 01:16:35.096
And I'm glad I did.

01:16:35.730 --> 01:16:38.299
But I can't see you again.

01:16:40.702 --> 01:16:42.404
But what if I need you?

01:16:45.974 --> 01:16:48.943
You said you would
always answer.

01:16:51.413 --> 01:16:52.547
Not a word?

01:16:53.816 --> 01:16:54.892
<i>Did you think that
consistent with good security?</i>

01:16:54.916 --> 01:16:57.585
As a matter of fact, it was.

01:16:57.619 --> 01:16:59.988
<i>Not a word.</i>

01:17:00.021 --> 01:17:02.190
When did you
see her after that?

01:17:10.598 --> 01:17:12.267
I never saw her again.

01:17:18.473 --> 01:17:21.109
I can make the last
train back to Princeton.

01:17:21.142 --> 01:17:24.312
Kitty, I didn't say anything
that I hadn't already told you.

01:17:24.345 --> 01:17:26.481
Today you said it to
history, didn't you?

01:17:26.514 --> 01:17:28.049
This is a closed hearing.

01:17:29.751 --> 01:17:31.362
If they don't
release the transcript,

01:17:31.386 --> 01:17:33.388
- I'm sure you will.
- I was under oath.

01:17:33.421 --> 01:17:35.190
Well, you were
under an oath for me

01:17:35.223 --> 01:17:37.025
when you went to see Jean.

01:17:37.692 --> 01:17:39.127
You know, you...

01:17:40.028 --> 01:17:42.330
you sit there, day after day,

01:17:42.363 --> 01:17:45.400
letting them pick
our lives to pieces.

01:17:48.403 --> 01:17:50.104
Why won't you fight?

01:17:53.241 --> 01:17:56.377
Robert, I'm
not putting her up there.

01:18:01.516 --> 01:18:04.385
Dr. Oppenheimer, it's an
honor. Please, take a seat.

01:18:04.419 --> 01:18:08.022
No need, um, I just wanted
to check whether I should

01:18:08.056 --> 01:18:10.225
talk to Lomanitz while I'm
here, given your concerns.

01:18:10.258 --> 01:18:12.360
Well, I'd say that's really
up to you, Professor,

01:18:12.393 --> 01:18:14.562
- but I'd be cautious.
- Uh-huh. Understood.

01:18:14.596 --> 01:18:17.332
Oh, and, um,
as regards to the union,

01:18:17.365 --> 01:18:19.133
I wanted to give you
a heads-up on a...

01:18:19.167 --> 01:18:20.502
on a man named Eltenton.

01:18:20.535 --> 01:18:22.036
A heads-up?

01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:26.007
Yes, just that he might
merit watching is all.

01:18:26.809 --> 01:18:28.243
Well, I'd love to
get more details.

01:18:28.276 --> 01:18:30.612
Well, I... I have
an appointment now

01:18:30.645 --> 01:18:32.080
and I leave early tomorrow.

01:18:32.113 --> 01:18:33.648
Well, come back as
early as you like.

01:18:33.681 --> 01:18:36.017
Since you haven't time now.

01:18:36.684 --> 01:18:38.520
You went back the next morning.

01:18:38.553 --> 01:18:40.555
I did, I had to, really.

01:18:41.489 --> 01:18:44.092
<i>This time, there
was another man.</i>

01:18:44.759 --> 01:18:46.261
He said his name's Pash.

01:18:46.294 --> 01:18:48.796
Pash. You met Colonel Pash?

01:18:48.831 --> 01:18:50.374
Colonel Pash,
could you please read

01:18:50.398 --> 01:18:54.202
from your memo
dated June 29, 1943?

01:18:56.304 --> 01:18:58.406
"Results of surveillance
conducted on subject

01:18:58.439 --> 01:19:01.276
"indicate further possible
Communist Party connections.

01:19:01.309 --> 01:19:03.478
"Subject met with and
spent considerable time

01:19:03.511 --> 01:19:05.713
"with one Jean
Tatlock, Communist,

01:19:05.747 --> 01:19:07.215
the record of whom is attached."

01:19:07.248 --> 01:19:09.117
The subject being
Dr. Oppenheimer?

01:19:09.150 --> 01:19:11.619
- Yes.
- Whom you had not met?

01:19:11.653 --> 01:19:13.454
Not then,
but soon after.

01:19:13.488 --> 01:19:14.866
He's the head of
security for the project.

01:19:14.890 --> 01:19:16.124
Shouldn't I know him?

01:19:16.157 --> 01:19:17.492
No, he should know you.

01:19:17.525 --> 01:19:19.427
I would never put you
in a room with Pash.

01:19:19.460 --> 01:19:20.728
Why not?

01:19:20.762 --> 01:19:22.831
When Pash first
heard about Lomanitz,

01:19:22.865 --> 01:19:25.800
he told the FBI he
was gonna kidnap him,

01:19:25.834 --> 01:19:27.302
take him out on a boat

01:19:27.335 --> 01:19:30.338
and interrogate him
in the Russian manner.

01:19:32.473 --> 01:19:35.310
General Groves has placed in
me a certain responsibility,

01:19:35.343 --> 01:19:37.579
and it's like having a
child who I can't see.

01:19:37.612 --> 01:19:39.714
- Ah.
- By remote control.

01:19:39.747 --> 01:19:43.351
So to actually meet you is...

01:19:44.452 --> 01:19:45.897
I won't take up too
much of your time.

01:19:45.921 --> 01:19:48.189
No, no, not at all.
Whatever time you choose.

01:19:48.222 --> 01:19:51.125
Mm. Mr. Johnson told
me of a conversation

01:19:51.159 --> 01:19:52.904
you had yesterday in
which I'm very interested.

01:19:52.928 --> 01:19:55.196
It's had me worried all day.

01:19:55.229 --> 01:19:57.732
Yes, well, I didn't
want to talk to Lomanitz

01:19:57.765 --> 01:19:59.300
without authorization.

01:19:59.334 --> 01:20:00.544
That's not the particular
interest that I have.

01:20:00.568 --> 01:20:02.537
It's something a
little bit more...

01:20:03.571 --> 01:20:05.340
well, in my opinion,
more serious.

01:20:05.373 --> 01:20:08.309
Now, when the FBI pointed
out that such information

01:20:08.343 --> 01:20:09.888
wouldn't be admissible in
court, Pash made it clear

01:20:09.912 --> 01:20:13.681
he had no intention of leaving
any witness left to prosecute.

01:20:13.715 --> 01:20:15.283
Now, the FBI talked him down,

01:20:15.316 --> 01:20:16.885
but that's the man
you're dancing with.

01:20:16.919 --> 01:20:19.621
I gather you've heard
there are other parties

01:20:19.654 --> 01:20:22.357
interested in the work
of the Radiation Lab.

01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:26.294
A man attached to
the Soviet Consul

01:20:26.327 --> 01:20:29.364
indicated, through
intermediate people,

01:20:29.397 --> 01:20:30.933
to people on this project,

01:20:30.966 --> 01:20:34.402
that he was in a position
to transmit information.

01:20:34.435 --> 01:20:37.271
Oh, why would anyone on the
project want to do that?

01:20:38.706 --> 01:20:41.242
Frankly, I can see that
there might be an argument

01:20:41.275 --> 01:20:43.678
for the Commander-in-Chief
informing the Russians...

01:20:43.711 --> 01:20:45.580
they're our allies after all...

01:20:45.613 --> 01:20:48.516
but I don't like the idea of
it going out the back door.

01:20:48.549 --> 01:20:51.285
It might not hurt to be
on the lookout for it.

01:20:52.687 --> 01:20:53.856
And you said that to Pash?

01:20:53.889 --> 01:20:55.390
I was trying to put it

01:20:55.423 --> 01:20:58.259
in a context of
Russia's not Germany.

01:20:58.292 --> 01:21:02.697
Boris Pash is the son of
a Russian Orthodox bishop.

01:21:02.730 --> 01:21:06.234
Born here, but in 1918,
he went back to Russia

01:21:06.267 --> 01:21:07.702
to fight the Bolsheviks.

01:21:07.735 --> 01:21:09.914
This is a man who has killed
Communists with his own hands.

01:21:09.938 --> 01:21:13.408
I'm not the judge of who should
or should not have information.

01:21:13.441 --> 01:21:15.486
It's my business to stop it
from going through illegally.

01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:17.712
Would you be a
little more specific?

01:21:20.581 --> 01:21:23.451
There's a man whose
name was mentioned to me

01:21:23.484 --> 01:21:25.586
a couple of times. Eltenton.

01:21:26.621 --> 01:21:29.724
Uh, I believe he's a
chemist who works at Shell.

01:21:29.757 --> 01:21:32.293
He talked to a friend of his

01:21:32.326 --> 01:21:36.230
who's an acquaintance of
someone on the project.

01:21:37.465 --> 01:21:39.902
And you thought Pash would
be satisfied with that?

01:21:39.935 --> 01:21:42.470
I was attempting to
give them Eltenton

01:21:42.503 --> 01:21:43.839
without opening a can of worms.

01:21:43.872 --> 01:21:45.841
I told them a
cock-and-bull story.

01:21:45.874 --> 01:21:47.408
Did you lie to
General Groves too?

01:21:47.442 --> 01:21:50.979
No. I admitted to him
that I'd lied to Pash.

01:21:51.013 --> 01:21:52.456
Do you recall
this conversation

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:54.883
about the Chevalier incident?

01:21:54.917 --> 01:21:57.318
I've seen so many
versions of it. Um...

01:21:57.351 --> 01:21:58.519
Wasn't confused before,

01:21:58.553 --> 01:21:59.988
but I'm certainly
getting there now.

01:22:00.022 --> 01:22:01.331
And what
was your conclusion?

01:22:01.355 --> 01:22:03.725
That he was under
the influence of

01:22:03.758 --> 01:22:06.627
the typical American
schoolboy attitude

01:22:06.661 --> 01:22:10.264
that there's something wicked
about telling on a friend.

01:22:10.298 --> 01:22:12.333
Well, now.

01:22:12.366 --> 01:22:14.802
Might we know through
whom the contact was made?

01:22:14.837 --> 01:22:17.039
That would in... involve people

01:22:17.072 --> 01:22:19.041
who are not to be
involved in this.

01:22:19.074 --> 01:22:21.844
Is that someone a
member of the project?

01:22:21.877 --> 01:22:26.414
A member of the faculty, yes,
but not in the project, no.

01:22:26.447 --> 01:22:27.548
Ah.

01:22:27.582 --> 01:22:29.350
So Eltenton made his approach

01:22:29.383 --> 01:22:32.620
through a member of the
faculty here at Berkeley?

01:22:34.355 --> 01:22:36.825
As far as I know. As
far as I know, yes.

01:22:36.859 --> 01:22:39.494
But there-there may have been

01:22:39.527 --> 01:22:42.263
more than one person involved.

01:22:45.666 --> 01:22:48.871
Gentlemen, if I... if
I seem uncooperative,

01:22:48.904 --> 01:22:51.840
I think you can understand
that's because of my insistence

01:22:51.874 --> 01:22:54.475
in not getting innocent
people into trouble.

01:22:54.509 --> 01:22:56.310
<i>You're trying
to protect your friend.</i>

01:22:56.344 --> 01:22:57.578
Who's protecting you?

01:22:57.612 --> 01:22:59.014
Well, you could.

01:22:59.047 --> 01:23:00.381
If you gave me the name.

01:23:00.414 --> 01:23:02.350
If you order me to, I'll do it.

01:23:02.383 --> 01:23:03.417
That's a mistake, Robert.

01:23:03.451 --> 01:23:05.286
You need to volunteer this name.

01:23:06.121 --> 01:23:07.789
<i>And did he
give you the name?</i>

01:23:07.823 --> 01:23:08.957
<i>He did.</i>

01:23:08.991 --> 01:23:10.458
- But not then, did he?
- No.

01:23:10.491 --> 01:23:11.970
No. In fact, it was some
months later, wasn't it?

01:23:11.994 --> 01:23:13.896
It was.

01:23:13.929 --> 01:23:15.030
You see me as persistent.

01:23:15.063 --> 01:23:16.798
Well, you are...

01:23:16.832 --> 01:23:18.666
you are persistent,
but that is your job.

01:23:18.699 --> 01:23:22.403
And-and my job is to protect
the people that work for me.

01:23:22.436 --> 01:23:24.438
Instead of us
going on certain steps,

01:23:24.472 --> 01:23:26.574
which may come to
your attention...

01:23:27.943 --> 01:23:29.710
and be disturbing to you,

01:23:29.744 --> 01:23:32.848
I would like to discuss
those with you first.

01:23:32.881 --> 01:23:34.382
I'm not formulating a plan.

01:23:34.415 --> 01:23:36.751
I'll just have to
digest the whole thing.

01:23:40.388 --> 01:23:43.091
<i>In the months in
between your interview</i>

01:23:43.125 --> 01:23:46.761
with Dr. Oppenheimer and his
eventual naming of Chevalier,

01:23:46.794 --> 01:23:48.096
did you expend resources

01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:49.606
trying to find the name
of the intermediary?

01:23:49.630 --> 01:23:52.100
Considerable resources, yes.

01:23:52.134 --> 01:23:54.368
Without the name, our job
was extremely difficult.

01:23:54.402 --> 01:23:55.838
And when did you
receive the name?

01:23:55.871 --> 01:23:57.105
I was gone by the time

01:23:57.139 --> 01:23:59.574
-Oppenheimer finally offered it up.
-Gone?

01:23:59.607 --> 01:24:01.776
They felt my time would
be better spent in Europe

01:24:01.810 --> 01:24:04.545
determining the status
of the Nazi bomb project.

01:24:04.579 --> 01:24:05.746
Who did?

01:24:06.849 --> 01:24:08.583
General Groves.

01:24:08.616 --> 01:24:10.384
He transferred me to London.

01:24:16.825 --> 01:24:18.927
<i>It's a little early
for a Christmas party.</i>

01:24:18.961 --> 01:24:20.963
Something's up.

01:24:20.996 --> 01:24:23.031
Tolman's been away.

01:24:23.065 --> 01:24:24.765
Where?

01:24:24.799 --> 01:24:26.367
Ruth won't tell.

01:24:30.906 --> 01:24:31.907
Hey!

01:24:36.078 --> 01:24:37.612
Come on, Ruthie.

01:24:37.645 --> 01:24:39.714
Can't tell me, who can you tell?

01:24:39.747 --> 01:24:42.483
Compartmentalization,
Oppie.

01:24:42.516 --> 01:24:43.895
What makes you think I
know where he is anyway?

01:24:43.919 --> 01:24:45.620
'Cause you
do a pretty good job

01:24:45.653 --> 01:24:48.422
of knowing where Mr. Tolman
is when it counts.

01:24:48.456 --> 01:24:49.992
Like now?

01:24:50.025 --> 01:24:53.461
Attention!

01:24:56.664 --> 01:24:58.599
Early Christmas
present for you all.

01:25:06.674 --> 01:25:09.044
<i>The British pilots
put me in the bomb bay.</i>

01:25:09.077 --> 01:25:11.079
Showed me the-the
oxygen, you know,

01:25:11.113 --> 01:25:12.848
but I messed it up.

01:25:12.881 --> 01:25:15.483
Uh, when they opened me up in
Scotland, I was unconscious.

01:25:15.516 --> 01:25:17.718
But I pretended
I'd been napping.

01:25:18.686 --> 01:25:20.122
Please enjoy your party.

01:25:21.489 --> 01:25:22.790
Is
it big enough?

01:25:22.824 --> 01:25:24.092
To end the war?

01:25:24.126 --> 01:25:27.029
To end all war.

01:25:29.865 --> 01:25:33.936
Uh, Heisenberg sought
me out in Copenhagen.

01:25:33.969 --> 01:25:35.703
It was chilling,

01:25:35.736 --> 01:25:37.772
my old student
working for the Nazis.

01:25:37.806 --> 01:25:41.709
He told me some
things to draw me out.

01:25:42.610 --> 01:25:45.948
Sustained fission
reactions in uranium.

01:25:45.981 --> 01:25:48.183
That sounds more like
a reactor than a bomb.

01:25:48.216 --> 01:25:49.650
Did he mention
gaseous diffusion?

01:25:49.684 --> 01:25:51.954
He seemed more focused
on heavy water.

01:25:51.987 --> 01:25:53.688
As a moderator?

01:25:53.721 --> 01:25:55.090
Yes, instead of graphite.

01:25:58.126 --> 01:25:59.493
What?

01:25:59.527 --> 01:26:01.696
He took a wrong turn.

01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:04.199
We're ahead. And with you
here to help us, Niels.

01:26:04.232 --> 01:26:06.500
Sorry, could you...

01:26:06.534 --> 01:26:09.470
could you give us a
moment, gentlemen?

01:26:15.643 --> 01:26:18.180
I am not here to help, Robert.

01:26:18.213 --> 01:26:20.115
I knew you could
do this without me.

01:26:20.148 --> 01:26:21.249
Then why did you come?

01:26:21.283 --> 01:26:22.717
To talk about after.

01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:24.719
The power you're about to reveal

01:26:24.752 --> 01:26:26.955
will forever outlive the Nazis.

01:26:28.023 --> 01:26:29.623
And the world is not prepared.

01:26:29.657 --> 01:26:31.059
"You could lift the stone

01:26:31.093 --> 01:26:33.728
without being ready for
the snake that's revealed."

01:26:33.761 --> 01:26:35.139
We have to make the
politicians understand,

01:26:35.163 --> 01:26:37.265
this isn't a new weapon.

01:26:37.299 --> 01:26:38.766
It's a new world.

01:26:38.799 --> 01:26:42.170
I'll be out there doing
what I can, but you...

01:26:42.204 --> 01:26:44.772
you're an American Prometheus.

01:26:44.806 --> 01:26:47.042
The man who gave them the power

01:26:47.075 --> 01:26:49.111
to destroy themselves,

01:26:49.144 --> 01:26:50.778
and they'll respect that.

01:26:50.812 --> 01:26:52.981
And your work really begins.

01:26:56.918 --> 01:27:00.055
I'm sorry, Oppie,
but there's a call.

01:27:01.189 --> 01:27:03.925
From San Francisco.

01:27:10.198 --> 01:27:11.900
Robert!

01:27:15.137 --> 01:27:16.670
Robert?

01:27:17.339 --> 01:27:19.908
Robert. Robert.

01:27:19.941 --> 01:27:22.144
God, what's the matter?

01:27:22.177 --> 01:27:23.945
What happened?

01:27:24.813 --> 01:27:26.747
Her father called.

01:27:26.781 --> 01:27:28.917
They found her
yesterday in the bath.

01:27:29.918 --> 01:27:31.053
Who?

01:27:32.054 --> 01:27:34.056
She'd taken pills.

01:27:34.089 --> 01:27:35.991
<i>Left a note, not signed.</i>

01:27:36.992 --> 01:27:37.959
She took barbiturates,

01:27:37.993 --> 01:27:39.928
but there was chloral
hydrate in her blood.

01:27:43.298 --> 01:27:44.632
There was a note.

01:27:44.665 --> 01:27:46.968
Jean Tatlock?

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:54.742
We were together.

01:27:54.775 --> 01:27:57.578
She said she needed me. I...

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.616
I told her I... I
wouldn't...

01:28:02.650 --> 01:28:04.286
I told her I couldn't...

01:28:04.319 --> 01:28:05.987
No, it was... it was me.

01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:11.093
You don't get to commit the sin

01:28:11.126 --> 01:28:12.928
and then have us all
feel sorry for you

01:28:12.961 --> 01:28:15.831
that it had consequences.

01:28:17.899 --> 01:28:20.102
You pull yourself together.

01:28:23.771 --> 01:28:25.907
You know, people
here depend on you.

01:28:28.410 --> 01:28:29.878
Donald, would you like

01:28:29.911 --> 01:28:30.988
to contribute here?
Please, help me out.

01:28:31.012 --> 01:28:32.223
You're
on your own, pal.

01:28:32.247 --> 01:28:33.357
Bob, I'm not quitting my job

01:28:33.381 --> 01:28:34.715
because plutonium
is radioactive.

01:28:34.748 --> 01:28:36.284
We just don't know
what it might do

01:28:36.318 --> 01:28:38.053
to the female
reproductive system...

01:28:38.086 --> 01:28:39.997
Your reproductive system is more
exposed than mine, presumably.

01:28:40.021 --> 01:28:42.891
Can we please? The
implosion device is nowhere.

01:28:42.924 --> 01:28:44.326
Hey, you can't rush everything.

01:28:44.359 --> 01:28:45.903
- Oppie, please.
- Well, there's rushing

01:28:45.927 --> 01:28:47.728
and there's getting on
with it, so pick one.

01:28:47.761 --> 01:28:49.763
Wait. Neddermeyer's
doing his job.

01:28:49.797 --> 01:28:50.731
Teller's not helping.

01:28:50.764 --> 01:28:52.300
You're not helping.

01:28:52.334 --> 01:28:53.734
I've been asking
for calculations

01:28:53.767 --> 01:28:54.912
on the implosion
lenses for weeks.

01:28:54.936 --> 01:28:56.404
The British can do it. Fuchs.

01:28:56.438 --> 01:28:57.738
Absolutely.

01:28:57.771 --> 01:28:59.141
It's your job, Teller.

01:28:59.174 --> 01:29:00.976
I'm engaged in research.

01:29:01.009 --> 01:29:03.677
On a hydrogen bomb
we're not even building.

01:29:11.785 --> 01:29:13.155
I won't work for that man.

01:29:14.923 --> 01:29:17.025
Let him go. He's a prima donna.

01:29:17.058 --> 01:29:19.294
I agree. He
should leave Los Alamos.

01:29:19.327 --> 01:29:20.829
Okay.

01:29:20.862 --> 01:29:22.730
Kisty, you replace Neddermeyer.

01:29:22.763 --> 01:29:24.166
Seth, I'm putting
you on plutonium.

01:29:24.199 --> 01:29:27.302
Lilli, you go work for
Kisty. Because he needs you.

01:29:27.335 --> 01:29:29.905
Fuchs, you take Teller's role.

01:29:29.938 --> 01:29:32.307
I'm putting you exclusively
on the implosion device.

01:29:32.340 --> 01:29:36.111
And no one is
leaving Los Alamos.

01:29:50.358 --> 01:29:52.327
- They won't let me leave.
- No.

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:53.962
I won't let you leave.

01:29:54.829 --> 01:29:57.933
Forget Hans. Forget fission.

01:29:57.966 --> 01:30:01.102
Stay here, research
what you want.

01:30:01.136 --> 01:30:03.737
Fusion, the hydrogen
bomb, whatever.

01:30:03.771 --> 01:30:04.940
We'll meet to discuss.

01:30:04.973 --> 01:30:06.441
You don't have time to meet.

01:30:06.474 --> 01:30:08.043
You're a politician now, Robert.

01:30:08.076 --> 01:30:10.711
You've left physics behind
many, many years ago.

01:30:11.546 --> 01:30:13.348
Once a week.

01:30:13.381 --> 01:30:15.250
One hour. You and me.

01:30:20.422 --> 01:30:22.991
Now raise this fucking barrier.

01:30:26.928 --> 01:30:29.364
<i>So the Super
was under development</i>

01:30:29.397 --> 01:30:31.366
<i>on your watch at Los Alamos?</i>

01:30:31.399 --> 01:30:32.901
Yes.

01:30:32.934 --> 01:30:34.802
And yet, after the war,

01:30:34.836 --> 01:30:36.438
you tried to deny it was viable.

01:30:36.471 --> 01:30:37.973
No, no, no. I...

01:30:38.006 --> 01:30:39.841
I pointed out technical
difficulties with it.

01:30:39.874 --> 01:30:41.519
You... Didn't you try to
kill it at the AEC meeting

01:30:41.543 --> 01:30:43.111
- after the Russian bomb test?
- No.

01:30:43.144 --> 01:30:45.247
But that was the
recommendation of the AEC,

01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:47.549
- was it not?
- After hours of discussion

01:30:47.582 --> 01:30:49.851
<i>about the best response.</i>

01:30:49.884 --> 01:30:54.990
An H-bomb is 1,000 times
the power of an A-bomb.

01:30:56.157 --> 01:30:59.928
Its only intended target
would be the largest cities.

01:30:59.961 --> 01:31:02.063
It's a weapon of mass genocide.

01:31:02.097 --> 01:31:04.399
Izzy, draw some circles
on this side of the map

01:31:04.432 --> 01:31:06.067
where they would target us.

01:31:06.101 --> 01:31:08.136
- Starting with New York. D.C.
- That's fair.

01:31:08.169 --> 01:31:10.939
It's a weapon of attack
with no defensive value.

01:31:10.972 --> 01:31:12.507
- Deterrence.
- "Deterrence"?

01:31:12.540 --> 01:31:14.142
Do we really need
more deterrence

01:31:14.175 --> 01:31:16.578
than our current
arsenal of atomic bombs?

01:31:16.611 --> 01:31:19.314
Y-You drown in ten feet
of water or-or 10,000,

01:31:19.347 --> 01:31:21.025
what's the difference?

01:31:21.049 --> 01:31:23.018
We can already drown
Russia. They know it.

01:31:23.051 --> 01:31:25.329
- And now they can drown us.
- So we're just escalating...

01:31:36.231 --> 01:31:39.067
As I said, Teller's
designs are still as

01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:41.036
impractical as they
were during the war.

01:31:41.069 --> 01:31:44.039
A hydrogen bomb can be made
to work, Oppie, you know that.

01:31:44.072 --> 01:31:45.216
I don't believe we should commit

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:47.142
all our resources
to that chance.

01:31:47.175 --> 01:31:50.045
Then how would you have Truman
reassure the American people?

01:31:50.078 --> 01:31:52.280
Simply by limiting the
spread of atomic weapons

01:31:52.314 --> 01:31:55.617
through international
control on nuclear energy.

01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:57.218
By which you mean
world government?

01:31:57.252 --> 01:32:00.188
The United Nations as
Roosevelt intended.

01:32:00.221 --> 01:32:03.124
Well, I... I asked what
Truman should do, right?

01:32:03.158 --> 01:32:06.061
The world's changed, it's
not fascism but Communism

01:32:06.094 --> 01:32:07.562
that now threatens our survival.

01:32:07.595 --> 01:32:11.232
Lewis, do you understand,
if we build a hydrogen bomb,

01:32:11.266 --> 01:32:14.135
the Russians will have no
choice but to build their own?

01:32:14.169 --> 01:32:15.937
Could they be working
on one already?

01:32:15.970 --> 01:32:18.473
Based on information gathered
from a spy at Los Alamos.

01:32:18.506 --> 01:32:19.974
No spy at Los Alamos.

01:32:20.008 --> 01:32:21.085
- Gentlemen.
- There wasn't?

01:32:21.109 --> 01:32:22.344
Let's not get sidetracked.

01:32:22.377 --> 01:32:24.079
I say we use this moment

01:32:24.112 --> 01:32:25.523
to gain concessions
from the Russians

01:32:25.547 --> 01:32:28.616
by committing that we will
not build a hydrogen bomb.

01:32:28.650 --> 01:32:30.285
Thereby revealing its existence.

01:32:30.318 --> 01:32:32.320
Which you seem convinced
they already know.

01:32:32.354 --> 01:32:33.955
All right.

01:32:33.988 --> 01:32:36.091
At this point, I'd like
the committee members

01:32:36.124 --> 01:32:40.061
to meet in privacy to
finalize our recommendations.

01:32:41.196 --> 01:32:43.198
I'm just not sure you
want to go down this road.

01:32:43.231 --> 01:32:45.500
Lewis, with respect, we
are the advisory committee,

01:32:45.533 --> 01:32:47.302
we will give them our advice.

01:32:47.335 --> 01:32:48.436
Good night.

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:56.911
Dr. Oppenheimer?
Hi. William Borden.

01:32:56.945 --> 01:32:58.279
Joint Committee
on Atomic Energy?

01:32:58.313 --> 01:32:59.514
Oh, yes, yes.

01:32:59.547 --> 01:33:01.182
During the war, I was a pilot.

01:33:02.317 --> 01:33:05.053
One night, flying
back from a raid,

01:33:05.086 --> 01:33:07.989
I saw an amazing
sight like a meteor.

01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:11.960
<i>A V-2 rocket headed to England.</i>

01:33:11.993 --> 01:33:13.995
I can't help but
imagine what it will be

01:33:14.028 --> 01:33:17.932
for such an enemy rocket
to carry an atomic warhead.

01:33:26.708 --> 01:33:28.052
Well, let's make sure
we're not the ones

01:33:28.076 --> 01:33:29.377
to make that possible.

01:33:36.084 --> 01:33:38.987
Oppie, I don't think you want
to go up against Strauss.

01:33:39.020 --> 01:33:41.089
If we both speak,
they listen to me.

01:33:41.122 --> 01:33:43.191
When you speak,
they hear a prophet.

01:33:43.224 --> 01:33:45.193
When Strauss speaks,
they hear themselves.

01:33:45.226 --> 01:33:47.028
They'll listen to a prophet.

01:33:47.061 --> 01:33:50.331
A prophet can't be
wrong. Not once.

01:33:50.365 --> 01:33:52.133
<i>Didn't
you accuse Oppenheimer</i>

01:33:52.167 --> 01:33:54.068
<i>of sabotaging the
development of the Super?</i>

01:33:54.102 --> 01:33:55.703
I was never one of those

01:33:55.737 --> 01:33:59.007
to bandy around terms
like "sabotage."

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.009
<i>But
Mr. Borden was?</i>

01:34:01.042 --> 01:34:02.310
As I understand it, possibly.

01:34:02.343 --> 01:34:04.446
How was Mr. Borden
able to put together

01:34:04.479 --> 01:34:05.747
such a detailed indictment?

01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:07.315
<i>He was no longer a
government employee,</i>

01:34:07.348 --> 01:34:09.984
yet he appears to have
had unlimited access

01:34:10.018 --> 01:34:11.519
to Dr. Oppenheimer's file.

01:34:11.553 --> 01:34:14.456
<i>Might Mr. Nichols have given
him access to the file?</i>

01:34:14.489 --> 01:34:16.391
Or someone else, at the AEC?

01:34:16.424 --> 01:34:19.260
That's a very serious
accusation, Senator.

01:34:19.294 --> 01:34:21.763
Is it your intention to
suggest that Dr. Oppenheimer

01:34:21.796 --> 01:34:23.731
is disloyal to
the United States?

01:34:23.765 --> 01:34:26.301
I've always assumed,
and still assume,

01:34:26.334 --> 01:34:29.037
that he's loyal to
the United States.

01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:30.514
I believe this. And
I shall believe it

01:34:30.538 --> 01:34:33.341
until I see very conclusive
proof to the opposite.

01:34:33.374 --> 01:34:35.143
<i>Do you or
do you not believe</i>

01:34:35.176 --> 01:34:37.545
<i>that Dr. Oppenheimer
is a security risk?</i>

01:34:45.753 --> 01:34:47.388
And if I may,

01:34:47.422 --> 01:34:50.225
when Hitler blew his
brains out in that bunker,

01:34:50.258 --> 01:34:51.803
it's my humble opinion
that there is no need

01:34:51.827 --> 01:34:53.294
for that bomb to
be seen anywhere

01:34:53.328 --> 01:34:55.096
except for that test site.

01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:57.131
But we at least
have to take a moment

01:34:57.165 --> 01:34:59.167
to think about whether the means

01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:01.469
justify the ends any
longer, because...

01:35:03.805 --> 01:35:06.374
Germany is about to surrender.

01:35:08.276 --> 01:35:11.613
It's no longer the enemy
who are the greatest threat

01:35:11.646 --> 01:35:13.448
to mankind, it's our work.

01:35:15.851 --> 01:35:18.586
Hitler's dead, it's true.

01:35:20.288 --> 01:35:21.824
But the Japanese fight on.

01:35:21.857 --> 01:35:23.525
Their defeat seems assured.

01:35:23.558 --> 01:35:26.561
Not if you're a G.I.
preparing to invade.

01:35:27.863 --> 01:35:29.163
We can end this war.

01:35:29.197 --> 01:35:30.598
But
how do we justify

01:35:30.632 --> 01:35:32.200
using this weapon
on human beings?

01:35:35.236 --> 01:35:38.640
We're theorists, yes?

01:35:38.673 --> 01:35:40.275
Yes. Yep.

01:35:40.308 --> 01:35:44.345
We imagine a future and
our imaginings horrify us.

01:35:45.413 --> 01:35:47.549
But they won't fear it
until they understand it,

01:35:47.582 --> 01:35:50.485
and they won't understand
it until they've used it.

01:35:50.518 --> 01:35:51.686
When the world learns

01:35:51.719 --> 01:35:54.222
the terrible secret
of Los Alamos,

01:35:54.255 --> 01:35:57.692
our work here will ensure a
peace mankind has never seen.

01:35:57.725 --> 01:36:01.095
A peace based on the kind
of international cooperation

01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:03.164
that Roosevelt always envisaged.

01:36:08.269 --> 01:36:09.504
<i>Progress?</i>

01:36:09.537 --> 01:36:12.307
Two years and a
billion dollars' worth?

01:36:12.340 --> 01:36:14.108
Well, hard to put a price on it.

01:36:14.142 --> 01:36:15.710
Not really, just
add up the bills.

01:36:15.743 --> 01:36:17.445
"Rural free deliveries."

01:36:17.478 --> 01:36:20.248
Eighty babies delivered
the first year.

01:36:20.281 --> 01:36:22.617
This year, we've
had ten a month.

01:36:22.650 --> 01:36:25.386
Birth control is a little out
of my jurisdiction, General.

01:36:26.254 --> 01:36:28.590
- Clearly.
- General.

01:36:33.561 --> 01:36:34.897
Head down, everyone.

01:36:34.930 --> 01:36:37.098
Fuchs, head down.

01:36:39.601 --> 01:36:40.768
Hmm?

01:36:43.638 --> 01:36:45.373
That's the one.

01:36:45.406 --> 01:36:48.309
Two viable bombs. I need a date.

01:36:50.612 --> 01:36:52.447
September.

01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:53.481
July.

01:36:53.514 --> 01:36:55.450
That's the sweet
spot, gentlemen.

01:36:55.483 --> 01:36:57.652
August.

01:36:57.685 --> 01:36:59.420
July.

01:36:59.454 --> 01:37:01.255
Test in July.

01:37:01.289 --> 01:37:02.925
But I need my brother.

01:37:07.295 --> 01:37:09.239
Frank knows the desert,
he's left politics behind,

01:37:09.263 --> 01:37:11.699
he's been working with
Lawrence for two years now.

01:37:18.673 --> 01:37:20.508
What do we call the test?

01:37:21.609 --> 01:37:25.380
"Batter my heart,
three-person'd god."

01:37:25.413 --> 01:37:26.514
What?

01:37:27.883 --> 01:37:29.283
Trinity.

01:37:36.959 --> 01:37:38.326
You insisted

01:37:38.359 --> 01:37:39.670
on bringing on
your brother Frank,

01:37:39.694 --> 01:37:41.305
- a known Communist.
- A former Communist.

01:37:41.329 --> 01:37:43.765
You brought a known
former Communist

01:37:43.798 --> 01:37:47.669
onto America's most secret
and important defense project.

01:37:47.702 --> 01:37:50.805
I knew my brother could
be trusted. Absolutely.

01:37:50.839 --> 01:37:52.808
And you felt your
judgment was sound

01:37:52.841 --> 01:37:54.676
on who on the team
could be trusted?

01:37:55.677 --> 01:37:56.812
Fuchs, head down.

01:37:56.845 --> 01:37:58.579
Okay, everybody ready?

01:37:59.948 --> 01:38:01.884
Hmm?

01:38:01.917 --> 01:38:03.685
Oh.

01:38:06.822 --> 01:38:07.956
Oh.

01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:09.724
Well, I hope you
learned something.

01:38:09.757 --> 01:38:11.669
Yeah, we learned we're gonna
need to be a lot further away.

01:38:11.693 --> 01:38:13.261
Well, figure it out. Fast.

01:38:13.294 --> 01:38:14.963
We leave for Washington
in the morning.

01:38:14.997 --> 01:38:17.198
We're gonna give them a date.

01:38:31.345 --> 01:38:33.015
You're a long way
from Chicago, Leo.

01:38:33.048 --> 01:38:34.549
If we don't act now,

01:38:34.582 --> 01:38:36.293
they're going to use
this thing against Japan.

01:38:36.317 --> 01:38:38.286
We booked a meeting with Truman,

01:38:38.319 --> 01:38:39.587
but somebody killed it.

01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:41.489
You're meeting the
Secretary of War.

01:38:41.522 --> 01:38:43.691
Just because we're building it,

01:38:43.725 --> 01:38:45.727
doesn't mean we get to
decide how it's used.

01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:48.529
History will judge us, Robert.

01:38:48.563 --> 01:38:51.867
In Chicago, we put
together a petition.

01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:53.836
I'm not... I'm not
getting into that.

01:38:58.907 --> 01:39:00.843
Just tell me your concerns,
and I'll relay them.

01:39:00.876 --> 01:39:01.977
My concerns?

01:39:02.010 --> 01:39:03.979
Germany's defeated.

01:39:04.012 --> 01:39:05.780
Japan's not going
to hold out alone.

01:39:05.814 --> 01:39:07.715
How could you know that?
You got us into this.

01:39:07.749 --> 01:39:09.526
You and Einstein with
your letter to Roosevelt

01:39:09.550 --> 01:39:12.353
- saying we could build a bomb.
- Against Germany.

01:39:12.386 --> 01:39:15.323
That's not how weapons
manufacture works, Szilard.

01:39:15.356 --> 01:39:16.500
Oppie,
you have to help.

01:39:16.524 --> 01:39:17.826
Fermi's
in the meeting.

01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:19.436
- Lawrence is in the meeting.
- They're not you.

01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:21.629
You're the great
salesman of science.

01:39:21.662 --> 01:39:24.265
You can convince
anyone of anything.

01:39:24.967 --> 01:39:26.367
Even yourself.

01:39:26.969 --> 01:39:28.369
'Scuse me.

01:39:29.403 --> 01:39:32.673
The firestorm in Tokyo
killed 100,000 people.

01:39:32.707 --> 01:39:34.509
Mostly civilians.

01:39:34.542 --> 01:39:37.079
I worry about an America
where we do these things

01:39:37.112 --> 01:39:38.847
and no one protests.

01:39:38.881 --> 01:39:41.917
Pearl Harbor and three years of
brutal conflict in the Pacific

01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:44.485
bought us a lot of latitude
with the American public.

01:39:44.519 --> 01:39:46.554
Enough to
unleash the atomic bomb?

01:39:46.587 --> 01:39:48.456
Uh, the A-bomb
might not cause

01:39:48.489 --> 01:39:50.391
as much damage as
the Tokyo bombings.

01:39:50.424 --> 01:39:51.793
What are we estimating?

01:39:51.827 --> 01:39:54.662
In a medium-size city, uh,

01:39:54.695 --> 01:39:56.098
20 or 30,000 dead.

01:39:56.131 --> 01:39:57.933
Yes, but, uh,

01:39:57.966 --> 01:40:01.003
don't underestimate the
psychological impact of a...

01:40:01.036 --> 01:40:02.436
of an atomic explosion.

01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:06.707
A pillar of fire
10,000 feet tall.

01:40:06.741 --> 01:40:10.078
Deadly neutron effects for
a mile, in all directions,

01:40:10.112 --> 01:40:13.015
from one single device.

01:40:13.048 --> 01:40:15.383
Dropped from a
barely noticed B-29,

01:40:15.416 --> 01:40:17.685
the atomic bomb will be

01:40:17.718 --> 01:40:20.555
a terrible revelation
of divine power.

01:40:20.588 --> 01:40:23.859
If that's true, it
would be definitive.

01:40:23.892 --> 01:40:25.961
World War II would be over.

01:40:25.994 --> 01:40:27.695
Our boys would come home.

01:40:27.728 --> 01:40:28.864
Military targets?

01:40:29.998 --> 01:40:32.667
Uh, there aren't any big enough.

01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:38.472
Perhaps a vital war plant
with workers housed nearby.

01:40:38.506 --> 01:40:40.843
And we could issue a warning
to reduce civilian casualties.

01:40:40.876 --> 01:40:43.045
They'd send everything
they have up against us,

01:40:43.078 --> 01:40:44.679
and I'd be up in that plane.

01:40:44.712 --> 01:40:47.916
But if we announce it
and it fails to go off,

01:40:47.950 --> 01:40:50.651
we'd scupper any chance
of a Japanese surrender.

01:40:50.685 --> 01:40:53.788
Is there no way to
demonstrate a bomb to Japan

01:40:53.822 --> 01:40:55.523
to provoke surrender?

01:40:55.556 --> 01:40:58.626
We intend to demonstrate it
in the most unambiguous terms.

01:40:58.659 --> 01:40:59.360
Twice.

01:40:59.393 --> 01:41:01.462
Once to show the weapon's power

01:41:01.495 --> 01:41:03.999
and a second to show that
we can keep doing this

01:41:04.032 --> 01:41:05.533
until they surrender.

01:41:05.566 --> 01:41:08.937
We have a list of 12
cities to choose from...

01:41:08.971 --> 01:41:10.873
Sorry, 11.

01:41:10.906 --> 01:41:12.607
I've taken Kyoto off the list

01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:16.444
due to its cultural significance
to the Japanese people.

01:41:16.477 --> 01:41:19.114
Also, my wife and I
honeymooned there.

01:41:19.147 --> 01:41:20.648
It's a magnificent city.

01:41:24.219 --> 01:41:25.921
Let me make this simple
for you, gentlemen.

01:41:25.954 --> 01:41:28.456
According to my intelligence,
which I cannot share with you,

01:41:28.489 --> 01:41:30.926
the Japanese people
will not surrender

01:41:30.959 --> 01:41:32.727
under any circumstances

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:36.164
short of a successful and total
invasion of the home islands.

01:41:36.198 --> 01:41:39.167
Many lives will be lost,
American and Japanese.

01:41:39.201 --> 01:41:41.435
The use of the atomic
bomb on Japanese cities

01:41:41.469 --> 01:41:43.437
will save lives.

01:41:43.471 --> 01:41:45.773
If we retain moral advantage.

01:41:45.807 --> 01:41:47.943
- How so?
- Well, if we use this weapon

01:41:47.976 --> 01:41:50.913
without informing our allies,
they'll see it as a threat.

01:41:50.946 --> 01:41:52.114
And we'll be in an arms race.

01:41:52.147 --> 01:41:54.216
How open can we be
with the Soviets?

01:41:54.249 --> 01:41:55.817
Secrecy won't
stop the Soviets

01:41:55.851 --> 01:41:58.220
from becoming part
of the atomic world.

01:41:58.253 --> 01:42:00.554
We've been told they
have no uranium.

01:42:00.588 --> 01:42:01.789
You've been misinformed.

01:42:01.823 --> 01:42:03.658
A Russian bomb is
a matter of time.

01:42:03.691 --> 01:42:07.095
The program needs to continue
at full pace after the war.

01:42:07.129 --> 01:42:09.730
Uh, Secretary
Stimson, if I may...

01:42:09.764 --> 01:42:13.768
Not all scientists on the
project are in agreement.

01:42:13.801 --> 01:42:16.671
In fact, this might be a moment
to consider other opinions.

01:42:16.704 --> 01:42:18.615
- If you talk a scientist in...
- The Manhattan Project

01:42:18.639 --> 01:42:20.008
has been plagued from the start

01:42:20.042 --> 01:42:23.845
by certain scientists
of doubtful discretion

01:42:23.879 --> 01:42:24.947
and uncertain loyalty.

01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:27.215
One of them just tried to
meet with the president.

01:42:27.249 --> 01:42:29.084
Now, we need these men,

01:42:29.117 --> 01:42:30.651
but as soon as it's practical,

01:42:30.685 --> 01:42:32.955
we should sever any such
scientists from the program.

01:42:32.988 --> 01:42:34.555
Wouldn't you agree, Doctor?

01:42:35.690 --> 01:42:37.525
If a Russian
bomb is inevitable,

01:42:37.558 --> 01:42:40.829
perhaps we should invite their
top scientists to Trinity.

01:42:40.862 --> 01:42:43.165
President Truman
has no intention

01:42:43.198 --> 01:42:44.765
of raising expectations

01:42:44.799 --> 01:42:47.601
that Stalin be included
in the atomic project.

01:42:47.635 --> 01:42:49.004
Informing him of
our breakthrough

01:42:49.037 --> 01:42:50.647
and presenting it as
a means to win the war

01:42:50.671 --> 01:42:53.574
need not make
unkeepable promises.

01:42:53.607 --> 01:42:55.153
But the Potsdam peace
conference in July

01:42:55.177 --> 01:42:57.079
will be President
Truman's last chance

01:42:57.112 --> 01:42:59.247
to have that conversation.

01:42:59.281 --> 01:43:01.183
Can you give us a
working bomb by then?

01:43:02.150 --> 01:43:05.887
Absolutely. We will test
fire before the conference.

01:43:10.624 --> 01:43:13.161
<i>Ground zero
observation posts</i>

01:43:13.195 --> 01:43:14.662
<i>at 10,000 yards</i>

01:43:14.695 --> 01:43:16.865
north, south and west.

01:43:16.898 --> 01:43:20.202
- Where do we trigger from?
- Uh, south 10,000.

01:43:20.235 --> 01:43:23.571
And base camp is ten
miles south, here.

01:43:23.604 --> 01:43:26.540
And there's a further
observation post

01:43:26.574 --> 01:43:28.743
on-on that hill 20 miles away.

01:43:28.776 --> 01:43:31.746
What's that, Frank? Trigger
lines already went in.

01:43:31.779 --> 01:43:35.283
The Air Force requested a
line of lights for their B-29.

01:43:35.317 --> 01:43:37.752
What B-29? Our
bomb's on the tower.

01:43:37.785 --> 01:43:39.154
They want
to use the test

01:43:39.187 --> 01:43:41.023
to confirm a safe
operating distance.

01:43:41.056 --> 01:43:42.290
That's risky.

01:43:42.324 --> 01:43:43.959
Not as risky as
dropping one over Japan

01:43:43.992 --> 01:43:45.769
and hoping that we were
right about the blast radius.

01:43:45.793 --> 01:43:47.905
Don't let them slow us down,
we're firing on the 15th.

01:43:47.929 --> 01:43:51.166
- The 15th? That's not...
- The 15th.

01:43:51.199 --> 01:43:53.534
The 15th.

01:43:54.635 --> 01:43:56.580
So I'll be here
at South Observation point

01:43:56.604 --> 01:43:58.807
<i>with Frank and Kistiakowsky.</i>

01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:01.343
You'll all be
assigned to Base Camp,

01:44:01.376 --> 01:44:04.578
West Observation
or Far Observation.

01:44:14.222 --> 01:44:16.124
Whoa, whoa. Careful
with the knife.

01:44:16.158 --> 01:44:18.592
There, carefully.

01:44:19.693 --> 01:44:21.229
Are those safe distances?

01:44:21.263 --> 01:44:23.764
They're based on
your calculations.

01:44:23.798 --> 01:44:26.700
Time to stand behind your
science, Hans. Literally.

01:44:50.125 --> 01:44:51.592
Yeah.

01:44:56.264 --> 01:44:58.100
What 'bout the radiation cloud?

01:44:58.133 --> 01:44:59.367
Without high winds,

01:44:59.401 --> 01:45:00.978
it should settle within
two to three miles.

01:45:01.002 --> 01:45:03.405
Evacuation measures
are in place.

01:45:03.438 --> 01:45:05.240
But we need good
weather for visibility,

01:45:05.273 --> 01:45:06.740
so it has to be fine.

01:45:07.843 --> 01:45:09.111
Everybody out.

01:45:19.287 --> 01:45:20.431
We go on the night of the 15th.

01:45:20.455 --> 01:45:22.390
It's a hard deadline,

01:45:22.424 --> 01:45:25.726
so if anyone has
anything, speak now.

01:45:26.428 --> 01:45:27.761
Okay, stop, stop.

01:45:27.795 --> 01:45:29.663
Everybody, mattresses.

01:45:29.697 --> 01:45:31.765
Put the mattress underneath.

01:45:48.749 --> 01:45:51.652
Could use a final
implosion test.

01:45:52.354 --> 01:45:54.322
It couldn't hurt.

01:45:54.356 --> 01:45:55.857
Do it.

01:45:56.825 --> 01:45:59.127
Is there anything else
that might stop us?

01:46:33.228 --> 01:46:36.131
It's happening, isn't it?

01:46:37.232 --> 01:46:39.000
I'll send a message.

01:46:39.868 --> 01:46:42.504
If it's gone our way,

01:46:42.537 --> 01:46:44.105
take in the sheets.

01:46:48.143 --> 01:46:49.177
Robert?

01:46:51.846 --> 01:46:53.281
Break a leg.

01:47:59.848 --> 01:48:02.984
Oppie's taken a very
modest three kilotons.

01:48:03.018 --> 01:48:05.387
- Teller's in with 45.
- 20.

01:48:05.420 --> 01:48:07.856
Twenty thousand tons of TNT,

01:48:07.889 --> 01:48:09.291
and does anyone
want the side action

01:48:09.324 --> 01:48:12.060
on atmospheric ignition?

01:48:13.028 --> 01:48:15.964
Are you saying
we'll have to delay?

01:48:15.997 --> 01:48:17.174
I'm saying it would be prudent.

01:48:17.198 --> 01:48:18.442
This weather, has
it reached the site?

01:48:24.272 --> 01:48:26.250
Bethe is calling to tell you
the implosion test failed.

01:48:26.274 --> 01:48:27.909
Hello, Hans.

01:48:27.942 --> 01:48:29.344
Yes, he's here.

01:48:30.178 --> 01:48:31.513
Yes.

01:48:34.082 --> 01:48:35.283
- Is he wrong?
- No.

01:48:35.317 --> 01:48:37.218
- No?
- No.

01:48:38.053 --> 01:48:39.621
So we're about to fire a dud?

01:48:39.654 --> 01:48:41.122
- No.
- Explain.

01:48:41.156 --> 01:48:43.925
Well, I can't. I
just... I-I just know.

01:48:43.958 --> 01:48:45.627
I know the implosion
lenses will work.

01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:47.062
If we fire these detonators

01:48:47.095 --> 01:48:48.339
and they don't
trigger a reaction,

01:48:48.363 --> 01:48:50.031
two years' worth of plutonium

01:48:50.065 --> 01:48:51.475
will be scattered
across White Sands.

01:48:51.499 --> 01:48:55.403
A month of my salary against
ten bucks says it lights.

01:48:55.437 --> 01:48:57.439
Jesus.

01:49:02.510 --> 01:49:05.647
The wind's picking
up at zero, not the rain.

01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:07.115
Lightning's circling.

01:49:07.148 --> 01:49:08.592
You think it might be
time to tell your men

01:49:08.616 --> 01:49:11.519
to get away from the steel
tower with the atomic bomb?

01:49:14.656 --> 01:49:16.624
Let's get to South Observation.

01:49:16.658 --> 01:49:18.126
Pull 'em out.

01:49:18.159 --> 01:49:19.570
We can make our
determination there.

01:49:24.966 --> 01:49:26.968
The team hasn't
slept in two nights.

01:49:27.001 --> 01:49:29.003
If we stand down,
make the bomb safe,

01:49:29.037 --> 01:49:30.372
we won't be back here for weeks.

01:49:30.405 --> 01:49:32.073
Then we'll miss Potsdam.

01:49:32.107 --> 01:49:34.008
I gotta get word
to Truman by 7:00.

01:49:34.042 --> 01:49:35.276
Our window's closing.

01:49:35.310 --> 01:49:36.378
What is this doing?

01:49:36.411 --> 01:49:37.912
Raining, blowing, lightning.

01:49:37.946 --> 01:49:39.981
- For how long, damn it?
- It's holdin' strong.

01:49:40.014 --> 01:49:41.316
It'll break before dawn.

01:49:41.349 --> 01:49:43.027
- How could you know that?
- I know this desert.

01:49:43.051 --> 01:49:44.152
Storm cools overnight.

01:49:44.185 --> 01:49:45.987
Just before dawn,
the storm breaks.

01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:48.223
He could be right, but
schedule as late as possible.

01:49:48.256 --> 01:49:49.991
5:30!

01:49:50.024 --> 01:49:51.059
Sign your forecast.

01:49:51.092 --> 01:49:52.169
If you're wrong, I'll hang you.

01:49:52.193 --> 01:49:53.995
Frank, tell them all, 5:30.

01:49:54.028 --> 01:49:56.164
- 5:30, 5:30.
- 5:30.

01:49:58.366 --> 01:50:03.304
Three years, 4,000
people, $2 billion.

01:50:03.338 --> 01:50:05.707
Well, if it doesn't
go off...

01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:07.342
we're both finished.

01:50:10.111 --> 01:50:12.080
I'm betting on three kilotons.

01:50:13.047 --> 01:50:14.492
Anything less, they
won't get what it is.

01:50:14.516 --> 01:50:19.087
What did Fermi mean by
"atmospheric ignition"?

01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:20.598
Well, we had a moment
where it looked like

01:50:20.622 --> 01:50:24.459
the chain reaction from an
atomic device might never stop.

01:50:25.693 --> 01:50:27.729
Setting fire to the atmosphere.

01:50:27.762 --> 01:50:29.731
Why is Fermi still
taking side bets on it?

01:50:29.764 --> 01:50:32.934
Call it gallows humor.

01:50:35.270 --> 01:50:38.072
Wait, are we saying
there's a chance

01:50:38.106 --> 01:50:39.974
that when we push that button,

01:50:40.008 --> 01:50:41.342
we destroy the world?

01:50:41.376 --> 01:50:43.545
Nothing in our research
over three years

01:50:43.578 --> 01:50:45.213
supports that conclusion.

01:50:45.246 --> 01:50:48.216
Except as the most
remote possibility.

01:50:48.249 --> 01:50:49.584
How remote?

01:50:49.617 --> 01:50:51.219
Chances are near zero.

01:50:52.554 --> 01:50:53.955
Near zero?

01:50:54.722 --> 01:50:57.292
What do you want
from theory alone?

01:50:58.793 --> 01:51:01.162
Zero would be nice.

01:51:04.466 --> 01:51:06.100
In exactly

01:51:06.134 --> 01:51:09.437
one hour, 58 minutes,

01:51:09.471 --> 01:51:11.005
we'll know.

01:51:17.045 --> 01:51:18.246
It's letting up.

01:51:31.125 --> 01:51:33.495
The arming party's left Zero,
they're heading this way.

01:51:33.528 --> 01:51:34.496
Throwing the switches.

01:51:34.529 --> 01:51:35.630
Turn the cars.

01:51:35.663 --> 01:51:38.132
Ready for emergency evacuation.

01:51:55.818 --> 01:51:57.058
Welder's glass.

01:51:57.085 --> 01:51:58.653
Everybody take your places.

01:51:58.686 --> 01:52:01.189
Everybody take a welder's glass.

01:52:02.690 --> 01:52:04.559
Everybody take a welder's glass.

01:52:55.777 --> 01:52:57.178
Twenty minutes.

01:53:00.682 --> 01:53:02.517
Twenty minutes.

01:53:13.695 --> 01:53:15.229
That's 20.

01:53:18.232 --> 01:53:19.701
On the leg, please.

01:53:21.235 --> 01:53:23.738
- Feynman.
- No.

01:53:23.771 --> 01:53:25.740
The glass. Stops the U.V.

01:53:25.773 --> 01:53:27.575
And what stops the glass?

01:53:28.576 --> 01:53:31.546
I'm gonna head to base
camp. Best of luck.

01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:34.215
Robert.

01:53:34.817 --> 01:53:36.651
Try not to blow up the world.

01:53:48.529 --> 01:53:49.631
Watch that needle.

01:53:49.664 --> 01:53:51.232
If the detonators don't charge

01:53:51.265 --> 01:53:53.201
or the voltage drops
below one volt,

01:53:53.234 --> 01:53:55.236
you hit that button, you abort.

01:53:55.269 --> 01:53:57.572
- Understood?
- Understood.

01:54:04.980 --> 01:54:07.515
Two
minutes to detonation.

01:54:07.548 --> 01:54:09.517
Everybody down.

01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:10.518
Do not turn around

01:54:10.551 --> 01:54:13.621
until you see light
reflected on the hills.

01:54:13.655 --> 01:54:14.789
Then look at the explosion

01:54:14.823 --> 01:54:16.457
only through your
welder's glass.

01:54:16.491 --> 01:54:19.193
Ninety
seconds to detonation.

01:54:20.829 --> 01:54:23.665
Ninety seconds to detonation.

01:54:23.698 --> 01:54:25.800
Is it rubbed in?

01:54:25.834 --> 01:54:27.201
Yeah.

01:54:33.541 --> 01:54:36.644
Sixty
seconds to detonation.

01:54:51.325 --> 01:54:53.561
These things are
hard on your heart.

01:54:53.594 --> 01:54:55.296
Thirty seconds.

01:55:00.401 --> 01:55:01.803
Detonators charged.

01:55:11.947 --> 01:55:15.416
Seventeen, sixteen,

01:55:15.450 --> 01:55:16.617
fifteen,

01:55:16.651 --> 01:55:17.820
fourteen,

01:55:17.853 --> 01:55:19.654
thirteen,

01:55:19.687 --> 01:55:21.857
twelve,

01:55:21.890 --> 01:55:23.558
eleven,

01:55:23.591 --> 01:55:25.560
ten,

01:55:25.593 --> 01:55:27.996
nine,

01:55:28.030 --> 01:55:29.998
eight,

01:55:30.032 --> 01:55:32.600
seven,

01:55:32.633 --> 01:55:35.003
six...

01:55:35.037 --> 01:55:36.504
five...

01:55:38.506 --> 01:55:40.976
four...

01:55:41.009 --> 01:55:42.945
three...

01:55:42.978 --> 01:55:44.512
two...

01:55:45.814 --> 01:55:46.882
one.

01:56:08.402 --> 01:56:10.338
Poof.

01:57:19.141 --> 01:57:22.510
<i>"And now
I am become Death.</i>

01:57:24.412 --> 01:57:26.581
<i>The destroyer of worlds."</i>

01:57:59.580 --> 01:58:00.949
It worked.

01:58:36.184 --> 01:58:38.186
- You owe me ten dollars!
- Oh!

01:58:40.521 --> 01:58:41.656
- Come on!
- Hang on.

01:58:41.689 --> 01:58:43.125
I'm good for it, Kisty.

01:58:43.158 --> 01:58:45.459
You are.

01:58:45.493 --> 01:58:48.196
Yes, you are!

01:59:12.287 --> 01:59:13.822
Well done.

01:59:15.523 --> 01:59:18.060
We did it! We did it!

01:59:18.093 --> 01:59:19.995
Well done.

01:59:24.799 --> 01:59:26.634
- Get me Potsdam right away.
- Yes, sir.

01:59:38.113 --> 01:59:39.881
Get a message to Kitty.

01:59:39.915 --> 01:59:40.614
We can't say anything.

01:59:40.648 --> 01:59:42.583
Tell her to take in the sheets.

01:59:50.591 --> 01:59:52.127
We did it, everyone!

01:59:56.999 --> 01:59:58.799
Hello?

01:59:58.834 --> 02:00:01.269
- Hi, Kitty?
- What, what? Charlotte...

02:00:01.303 --> 02:00:02.670
Charlotte, go ahead, go ahead.

02:00:02.703 --> 02:00:04.072
Oh, um, well, I don't know,

02:00:04.106 --> 02:00:07.309
he just said to tell you
to "bring in the sheets."

02:00:10.012 --> 02:00:11.579
Kitty?

02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:15.117
Kitty? Kitty, are
you still there?

02:00:22.024 --> 02:00:24.159
<i>If they detonate
it too high in the air,</i>

02:00:24.192 --> 02:00:25.559
the blast won't be as powerful.

02:00:25.593 --> 02:00:27.628
With respect, Dr. Oppenheimer,

02:00:27.661 --> 02:00:29.697
we'll take it from here.

02:00:39.941 --> 02:00:42.844
Did Truman brief
Stalin at Potsdam?

02:00:42.878 --> 02:00:45.613
A brief would be
an overstatement.

02:00:45.646 --> 02:00:49.717
He referred to a
powerful new weapon.

02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:54.823
Stalin hoped we'd
use it against Japan.

02:00:56.058 --> 02:00:57.792
That's it?

02:00:57.826 --> 02:01:01.063
Robert, we've given them an ace,
it's for them to play the hand.

02:01:03.198 --> 02:01:05.300
You're aiming for the 6th?

02:01:05.333 --> 02:01:07.635
It's up to the CO
in the Pacific.

02:01:08.970 --> 02:01:11.039
Shall I come with
you to Washington?

02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:13.875
What for?

02:01:16.144 --> 02:01:17.745
Well, you'll keep me informed.

02:01:19.081 --> 02:01:20.714
Of course.

02:01:22.284 --> 02:01:23.885
As best I can.

02:01:41.303 --> 02:01:44.172
Would the Japanese surrender
if they knew what was coming?

02:01:45.407 --> 02:01:47.008
I don't know.

02:01:49.411 --> 02:01:51.413
Have you seen
Szilard's petition?

02:01:51.446 --> 02:01:54.182
What the hell does Szilard
know about the Japanese?

02:01:54.216 --> 02:01:55.426
You're not signing it, are you?

02:01:55.450 --> 02:01:58.854
Many people have. A
lot of people have.

02:01:58.887 --> 02:02:00.021
Edward.

02:02:01.289 --> 02:02:02.958
The fact that we built this bomb

02:02:02.991 --> 02:02:05.994
does not give us any more...
any more right or responsibility

02:02:06.027 --> 02:02:08.130
to decide how it's
used than anyone else.

02:02:08.163 --> 02:02:10.165
But we're the only
people who know about it.

02:02:10.198 --> 02:02:13.767
I've told Stimson the various
opinions of the community.

02:02:13.801 --> 02:02:15.203
But what's your opinion?

02:02:16.438 --> 02:02:17.973
Once it's used...

02:02:19.074 --> 02:02:22.776
nuclear war, perhaps all war...

02:02:24.379 --> 02:02:25.814
becomes unthinkable.

02:02:25.847 --> 02:02:28.850
Until somebody
builds a bigger bomb.

02:02:49.437 --> 02:02:51.173
I thought they would call.

02:02:51.206 --> 02:02:52.773
It's only the 5th.

02:02:54.943 --> 02:02:56.945
In Japan, it's the 6th.

02:03:10.091 --> 02:03:11.092
Charlotte.

02:03:13.428 --> 02:03:15.130
Try Groves.

02:03:16.131 --> 02:03:17.199
<i>Anything?</i>

02:03:19.501 --> 02:03:20.869
Charlotte?

02:03:20.902 --> 02:03:22.204
Truman's
on the radio.

02:03:23.138 --> 02:03:26.041
Sixteen hours ago,

02:03:26.074 --> 02:03:31.980
an American airplane dropped
one bomb on Hiroshima...

02:03:33.014 --> 02:03:36.151
and destroyed its
usefulness to the enemy.

02:03:38.119 --> 02:03:43.992
The bomb had more power
than 20,000 tons of TNT.

02:03:45.460 --> 02:03:47.929
It is an atomic bomb.

02:03:51.132 --> 02:03:52.500
It is a harnessing

02:03:52.534 --> 02:03:55.303
of the basic powers
of the universe.

02:03:57.339 --> 02:03:58.974
<i>Groves on one.</i>

02:03:59.007 --> 02:04:02.043
We are now prepared
to destroy more rapidly

02:04:02.077 --> 02:04:04.379
and completely the Japanese...

02:04:04.412 --> 02:04:06.081
General?

02:04:06.114 --> 02:04:09.150
I'm very proud of
you and all of your people.

02:04:09.184 --> 02:04:10.518
It went all right?

02:04:10.552 --> 02:04:13.521
Apparently, it went
with a tremendous bang.

02:04:13.555 --> 02:04:15.190
Well,

02:04:15.223 --> 02:04:18.159
everyone here is feeling
reasonably good about it.

02:04:19.594 --> 02:04:21.229
It's been a long road.

02:04:21.263 --> 02:04:24.065
I think one of the
wisest things I ever did

02:04:24.099 --> 02:04:27.135
was when I selected the
director of Los Alamos.

02:04:29.504 --> 02:04:31.840
<i>We have spent</i>

02:04:31.873 --> 02:04:33.875
<i>more than $2 billion</i>

02:04:33.908 --> 02:04:38.146
<i>on the greatest scientific
gamble in history,</i>

02:04:38.179 --> 02:04:41.016
<i>and we have won.</i>

02:04:44.552 --> 02:04:47.255
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

02:04:47.289 --> 02:04:49.291
Oppie! Oppie!

02:04:49.324 --> 02:04:52.527
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:54.396
Oppie! Oppie!

02:04:54.429 --> 02:04:57.198
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

02:04:57.232 --> 02:05:00.568
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

02:05:00.602 --> 02:05:05.206
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

02:05:05.240 --> 02:05:06.574
Oppie! Oppie!

02:05:06.608 --> 02:05:09.177
Oppie! Oppie! Oppie! Oppie!

02:06:08.269 --> 02:06:09.371
The world...

02:06:11.373 --> 02:06:12.507
will remember this day.

02:06:31.426 --> 02:06:33.161
It's too soon to...

02:06:34.028 --> 02:06:35.697
It's too soon to determine

02:06:35.730 --> 02:06:38.099
what the results
of the bombing are.

02:06:41.035 --> 02:06:42.637
But I'll bet the
Japanese didn't like it.

02:07:03.525 --> 02:07:05.059
I'm so proud.

02:07:06.194 --> 02:07:08.329
So proud of what you
have accomplished.

02:07:14.636 --> 02:07:18.473
I just wish we had it in time
to use against the Germans.

02:09:08.316 --> 02:09:10.184
Dr. Oppenheimer?

02:09:10.785 --> 02:09:13.087
Dr. Oppenheimer?

02:09:13.121 --> 02:09:14.789
- Nice picture.
- Oh.

02:09:14.823 --> 02:09:17.158
President Truman
will see you now.

02:09:30.873 --> 02:09:33.708
Dr. Oppenheimer. It's an honor.

02:09:33.741 --> 02:09:35.677
- Mr. President.
- Please.

02:09:35.710 --> 02:09:37.512
Thank you.

02:09:37.545 --> 02:09:39.080
Secretary Byrnes.

02:09:40.281 --> 02:09:42.283
How's it feel to be

02:09:42.317 --> 02:09:44.352
the most famous
man in the world?

02:09:45.353 --> 02:09:48.423
You helped save a lot
of American lives.

02:09:48.456 --> 02:09:50.826
What we did at
Hiroshima was a...

02:09:50.859 --> 02:09:52.794
And Nagasaki.

02:09:52.828 --> 02:09:54.830
Well, obviously.

02:09:54.863 --> 02:09:58.800
Your invention let us
bring our boys home.

02:09:58.834 --> 02:10:02.203
Well, it was hardly
my invention.

02:10:02.236 --> 02:10:04.505
It was you on the cover of <i>Time.</i>

02:10:07.375 --> 02:10:08.911
Jim tells me you're concerned

02:10:08.944 --> 02:10:10.712
about an arms race
with the Soviets.

02:10:10.745 --> 02:10:13.114
Uh, yes, uh...

02:10:13.816 --> 02:10:15.316
Well, um,

02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:20.455
it's that, uh, now is
our chance to secure

02:10:20.488 --> 02:10:23.358
international cooperation on
atomic energy,

02:10:23.391 --> 02:10:26.427
and... and I'm concerned...

02:10:26.461 --> 02:10:28.696
Do you know when the Soviets
are gonna have the bomb?

02:10:28.730 --> 02:10:30.665
I don't think I could give a...

02:10:30.698 --> 02:10:32.101
Never.

02:10:32.734 --> 02:10:34.369
Never.

02:10:34.402 --> 02:10:37.572
Mr. President, the-the
Russians have good physicists

02:10:37.605 --> 02:10:39.240
and-and... and
abundant resources.

02:10:39.273 --> 02:10:41.376
- Abundant?
- Yes.

02:10:41.409 --> 02:10:44.679
I don't think so.

02:10:44.712 --> 02:10:48.249
Well, they'll-they'll put
everything they have and...

02:10:51.519 --> 02:10:55.390
I hear you're
leaving Los Alamos.

02:10:56.658 --> 02:10:57.759
What should we do with it?

02:10:57.792 --> 02:11:00.294
Give it back to the Indians.

02:11:07.702 --> 02:11:10.939
Um... Dr. Oppenheimer,

02:11:10.973 --> 02:11:13.307
if what you say about
the Soviets is true,

02:11:13.341 --> 02:11:16.744
we have to build up Los Alamos,

02:11:16.778 --> 02:11:18.680
not shut it down.

02:11:21.917 --> 02:11:23.718
Uh, Mr. President...

02:11:24.786 --> 02:11:26.287
Um...

02:11:28.957 --> 02:11:32.627
I feel that I have
blood on my hands.

02:11:52.413 --> 02:11:57.719
You think anyone in
Hiroshima or Nagasaki

02:11:57.752 --> 02:12:00.788
gives a shit who built the bomb?

02:12:03.959 --> 02:12:06.327
They care who dropped it.

02:12:07.029 --> 02:12:09.297
I did.

02:12:10.531 --> 02:12:13.501
Hiroshima isn't about you.

02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:21.776
Dr. Oppenheimer.

02:12:32.720 --> 02:12:35.523
Don't let that
crybaby back in here.

02:12:40.628 --> 02:12:43.664
<i>Robert saw that
hand-wringing got him nowhere.</i>

02:12:43.698 --> 02:12:47.035
<i>By the time I'd met
him, he'd fully embraced</i>

02:12:47.069 --> 02:12:49.637
<i>his "father of the
bomb" reputation.</i>

02:12:49.670 --> 02:12:52.074
Used his profile to
influence policy.

02:13:01.549 --> 02:13:02.927
<i>Doctor, in the
years following the war,</i>

02:13:02.951 --> 02:13:05.087
would you say that you
exerted a great influence

02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:06.922
on the atomic
policies of the USA?

02:13:06.955 --> 02:13:09.657
<i>I think great
would be an overstatement.</i>

02:13:09.690 --> 02:13:11.659
Really? If we look
at the issue of isotopes,

02:13:11.692 --> 02:13:13.394
were you not
personally responsible

02:13:13.427 --> 02:13:15.463
for destroying all
opposition to their export?

02:13:15.496 --> 02:13:18.366
Could use a-a bottle of beer...

02:13:18.399 --> 02:13:20.078
when making atomic
weapons. In fact, you do.

02:13:20.102 --> 02:13:22.570
I was the spokesman,
but the-the opinion

02:13:22.603 --> 02:13:24.405
among scientists was unanimous.

02:13:24.438 --> 02:13:26.108
All along with
McCarthy on the rise,

02:13:26.141 --> 02:13:27.542
he knew he was vulnerable.

02:13:27.575 --> 02:13:28.944
His brother was blacklisted

02:13:28.977 --> 02:13:31.880
by every university
in the country.

02:13:32.981 --> 02:13:35.818
Lomanitz wound up working
the railroad, laying track.

02:13:38.419 --> 02:13:39.855
And Chevalier went into exile.

02:13:42.991 --> 02:13:44.425
But none of that

02:13:44.458 --> 02:13:46.427
stopped Robert from
pushing the GAC

02:13:46.460 --> 02:13:49.330
to recommend arms control
instead of the H-bomb.

02:13:51.133 --> 02:13:52.600
He was devastated

02:13:52.633 --> 02:13:54.702
when Truman rejected
their recommendation.

02:13:56.437 --> 02:13:58.974
I miss Richard more
than I can bear.

02:13:59.007 --> 02:14:00.775
I know, Ruth, I know.

02:14:00.809 --> 02:14:03.912
Part of me's glad he didn't live
to see where this is all going.

02:14:06.681 --> 02:14:08.116
Here comes
the birthday boy.

02:14:08.150 --> 02:14:10.751
- To gloat.
- Have fun.

02:14:11.752 --> 02:14:14.122
Robert, uh, my son and his
fiancÃ©e are desperate to meet

02:14:14.156 --> 02:14:16.124
the father of the
atomic bomb, and so...

02:14:16.158 --> 02:14:18.961
Well. Good day.

02:14:25.033 --> 02:14:27.135
Is this a bad time?

02:14:27.169 --> 02:14:28.669
What do you think, Lewis?

02:14:28.703 --> 02:14:30.771
Well, I think it must
have been a blow for you.

02:14:30.805 --> 02:14:32.941
For the world.

02:14:32.975 --> 02:14:34.609
The world?

02:14:34.642 --> 02:14:38.613
What does Fuchs mean to
the rest of the world?

02:14:38.646 --> 02:14:40.048
Fuchs?

02:14:40.082 --> 02:14:41.682
Klaus Fuchs?

02:14:43.118 --> 02:14:45.519
Oh, dear. You haven't heard.

02:14:48.689 --> 02:14:50.558
Klaus Fuchs, the British
scientist that you put

02:14:50.591 --> 02:14:53.628
onto the implosion
team at Los Alamos,

02:14:53.661 --> 02:14:55.796
<i>turns out he was...</i>

02:14:55.831 --> 02:14:59.101
he was spying for the
Soviets the whole time.

02:14:59.134 --> 02:15:00.668
I'm sorry.

02:15:05.841 --> 02:15:08.743
<i>After the truth
about Fuchs came out,</i>

02:15:08.776 --> 02:15:10.879
the FBI stepped up
surveillance on him.

02:15:10.913 --> 02:15:14.782
He knew his phone was tapped,
he was followed everywhere...

02:15:16.151 --> 02:15:17.585
his trash picked through.

02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:23.058
But never stopped
speaking his mind.

02:15:23.091 --> 02:15:25.760
A man of conviction.

02:15:25.793 --> 02:15:28.629
And maybe he thought fame
could actually protect him.

02:15:30.132 --> 02:15:33.567
When Eisenhower took office,
he saw one more chance.

02:15:34.970 --> 02:15:36.004
He took it.

02:15:36.038 --> 02:15:38.506
America and Russia

02:15:38.539 --> 02:15:42.811
may be likened to two
scorpions in a bottle,

02:15:42.844 --> 02:15:46.214
each capable of
killing the other

02:15:46.248 --> 02:15:48.951
but only at the risk
of his own life.

02:15:48.984 --> 02:15:51.752
Now, there are various
aspects of this policy...

02:15:51.786 --> 02:15:53.788
<i>Lot of
scientists blame me,</i>

02:15:53.822 --> 02:15:56.959
<i>but how was I supposed
to protect him?</i>

02:15:56.992 --> 02:15:58.961
Too secret for discussion,

02:15:58.994 --> 02:16:00.996
candor is the only remedy.

02:16:01.029 --> 02:16:02.563
Officials in Washington

02:16:02.596 --> 02:16:04.108
need to start leveling
with the American people.

02:16:05.800 --> 02:16:08.636
That was the last straw
for Robert's enemies.

02:16:08.669 --> 02:16:10.705
So he had to lose his
security clearance.

02:16:10.738 --> 02:16:13.507
And with it, his credibility.

02:16:13.541 --> 02:16:15.944
But how could they do it?

02:16:15.978 --> 02:16:17.245
He was a war hero.

02:16:17.279 --> 02:16:18.981
He'd already told
everyone about his past.

02:16:19.014 --> 02:16:20.983
Borden dredged it all up.

02:16:21.016 --> 02:16:24.252
How could Borden get access
to Oppenheimer's FBI file?

02:16:24.286 --> 02:16:25.854
Could it have been Nichols?

02:16:25.887 --> 02:16:28.190
No, I can't imagine
he'd do that.

02:16:28.223 --> 02:16:30.258
But whoever did
unleashed a firestorm

02:16:30.292 --> 02:16:32.294
that burned a path
from the White House

02:16:32.326 --> 02:16:34.996
back to my desk at the AEC.

02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:36.865
You see them in there, right?

02:16:36.897 --> 02:16:40.768
I've been working my
whole life to get here.

02:16:40.800 --> 02:16:42.838
Cabinet of the United
States of America.

02:16:42.870 --> 02:16:44.805
Now, in front of
the entire country,

02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:46.907
they're gonna put
me back in my place.

02:16:48.343 --> 02:16:51.013
A lowly shoe salesman.

02:16:51.046 --> 02:16:52.880
Lewis, we can win this thing.

02:16:52.914 --> 02:16:54.983
I-I think we can get
the Senate to grasp

02:16:55.017 --> 02:16:57.818
that you did your duty,
painful though it was.

02:16:57.852 --> 02:16:59.620
Now, will Hill's
testimony back us up?

02:16:59.653 --> 02:17:01.630
- Hill will be fine.
- I don't really know him,

02:17:01.655 --> 02:17:03.825
but, uh, he was one of
Szilard's boys in Chicago,

02:17:03.859 --> 02:17:05.894
and they never forgave
Robert for not supporting

02:17:05.927 --> 02:17:08.330
their petition
against bombing Japan.

02:17:08.362 --> 02:17:13.566
This was taken 31 days
after the bombing.

02:17:13.601 --> 02:17:16.338
Virtually everyone
in the street,

02:17:16.370 --> 02:17:18.606
for nearly a mile around,

02:17:18.638 --> 02:17:21.843
was instantly and
seriously burned.

02:17:23.077 --> 02:17:27.615
The, uh, Japanese spoke of
people who wore striped clothing

02:17:27.647 --> 02:17:30.618
upon whom the skin
was burned in stripes.

02:17:31.684 --> 02:17:34.056
There were many who
thought themselves lucky,

02:17:34.089 --> 02:17:36.790
who climbed out of the
ruins of their homes

02:17:36.825 --> 02:17:38.691
only slightly injured.

02:17:39.827 --> 02:17:41.594
But they died anyway.

02:17:42.263 --> 02:17:45.367
They died days or weeks later

02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:48.736
from the radium-like rays
emitted in great numbers

02:17:48.769 --> 02:17:50.671
at the moment of the explosion.

02:17:51.873 --> 02:17:53.941
Did you read this
crap in the papers?

02:17:53.975 --> 02:17:56.777
A British physicist is
saying the atomic bombings

02:17:56.812 --> 02:17:58.980
were not the last
act of World War II

02:17:59.013 --> 02:18:02.150
but the first act of this
cold war with Russia.

02:18:02.183 --> 02:18:03.651
Which physicist?

02:18:03.683 --> 02:18:05.087
I think you knew him.

02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:06.719
Patrick Blackett.

02:18:09.191 --> 02:18:10.758
He may not be wrong.

02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:12.127
Stimson is now telling me

02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:15.397
we bombed an enemy that
was essentially defeated.

02:18:15.430 --> 02:18:18.967
Robert, you've
all the influence now.

02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:20.700
Please.

02:18:20.734 --> 02:18:22.838
Urge them to continue my
research on the Super.

02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:24.239
I neither can nor will, Edward.

02:18:24.272 --> 02:18:26.374
Why not?

02:18:26.407 --> 02:18:28.110
It's not the right
use of our resources.

02:18:28.143 --> 02:18:30.245
Is that what you really believe?

02:18:30.278 --> 02:18:32.646
J. Robert Oppenheimer.

02:18:32.680 --> 02:18:35.083
Sphinx-like guru of the atom.

02:18:36.384 --> 02:18:38.153
Nobody knows what you believe.

02:18:39.254 --> 02:18:41.123
Do you? Hmm?

02:18:41.156 --> 02:18:43.859
<i>One final time,
our program director,</i>

02:18:43.892 --> 02:18:45.861
<i>Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer.</i>

02:18:47.062 --> 02:18:48.830
<i>I hope that
in years to come</i>

02:18:48.864 --> 02:18:52.868
you will look back on
your work here with pride.

02:18:52.901 --> 02:18:55.270
But today, that pride
must be tempered

02:18:55.303 --> 02:18:57.638
with a profound concern.

02:18:58.906 --> 02:19:00.708
If atomic weapons
are to be added

02:19:00.741 --> 02:19:03.145
to the arsenals of
a warring world,

02:19:03.178 --> 02:19:06.746
then the day will come
when people will curse

02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:08.183
the name of Los Alamos.

02:19:12.187 --> 02:19:14.289
Uh, sorry, Admiral.

02:19:14.322 --> 02:19:16.324
Stopped off to get this.

02:19:16.358 --> 02:19:19.161
It seems pretty favorable.

02:19:19.193 --> 02:19:20.304
There's Oppenheimer.

02:19:20.327 --> 02:19:21.897
What's the caption?

02:19:21.930 --> 02:19:24.764
Uh, "J. Robert Oppenheimer,
Strauss fought..."

02:19:26.334 --> 02:19:27.903
"and the US won."

02:19:28.736 --> 02:19:30.004
That'll work.

02:19:30.038 --> 02:19:32.273
Those were your words
from the other day.

02:19:32.307 --> 02:19:33.707
We needed to pivot.

02:19:33.741 --> 02:19:35.010
But how would you know

02:19:35.043 --> 02:19:36.844
what <i>Time</i> magazine's
gonna write?

02:19:36.878 --> 02:19:39.114
Henry Luce is a friend.

02:19:45.253 --> 02:19:48.756
You sat here and let me
tell you how it's done,

02:19:48.789 --> 02:19:51.459
but you've been far
ahead all along.

02:19:51.493 --> 02:19:54.462
Survival in Washington

02:19:54.496 --> 02:19:56.831
is about knowing how
to get things done.

02:19:57.465 --> 02:19:58.867
Right.

02:20:00.468 --> 02:20:02.204
What was it you
said about Borden?

02:20:02.237 --> 02:20:05.240
"Why get caught holding
the knife yourself?"

02:20:07.075 --> 02:20:10.078
I'm beginning to think Borden
was holding the knife for you.

02:20:12.147 --> 02:20:14.382
It's gonna come down
to how much influence

02:20:14.416 --> 02:20:16.484
Borden's been able
to exert on Teller.

02:20:16.518 --> 02:20:18.954
Did I say something funny?

02:20:18.987 --> 02:20:20.355
Just "Borden, Borden, Borden"

02:20:20.388 --> 02:20:24.159
when we all know
that it's Strauss.

02:20:24.192 --> 02:20:26.161
Lewis brought me to
Princeton, Kitty.

02:20:26.194 --> 02:20:28.897
And then you humiliated
him in front of Congress.

02:20:28.930 --> 02:20:31.765
But more useful than a sandwich.

02:20:34.936 --> 02:20:36.113
- How'd I do?
- I'll call recess,

02:20:36.137 --> 02:20:37.239
ten minutes.

02:20:37.272 --> 02:20:39.507
Maybe a little too well, Robert.

02:20:39.541 --> 02:20:40.774
That was six years ago.

02:20:40.809 --> 02:20:42.510
You know, the truly vindictive,

02:20:42.544 --> 02:20:44.145
patient as saints.

02:20:44.179 --> 02:20:46.982
Strauss has been perfectly
clear that he is neutral.

02:20:47.015 --> 02:20:50.518
Wake up. It is Strauss.

02:20:50.552 --> 02:20:53.488
It's always been
Strauss, and you know it.

02:20:53.521 --> 02:20:55.156
Why won't you fight him?

02:20:56.191 --> 02:20:57.392
Christ's sake.

02:20:58.493 --> 02:21:01.162
It wasn't Nichols or Hoover

02:21:01.196 --> 02:21:02.864
or one of Truman's
guys. It was you.

02:21:02.897 --> 02:21:04.866
You gave the file to Borden.

02:21:04.899 --> 02:21:06.534
You set him on Oppenheimer.

02:21:06.568 --> 02:21:09.004
- You convinced him to...
- Borden...

02:21:09.037 --> 02:21:10.939
Didn't
take any convincing.

02:21:10.972 --> 02:21:13.074
Take your time,
use the entire file.

02:21:13.108 --> 02:21:16.011
Write up your conclusion,
send them to the FBI.

02:21:16.044 --> 02:21:18.280
The material is
obviously extensive,

02:21:18.313 --> 02:21:20.982
but there's nothing new here.

02:21:21.016 --> 02:21:22.550
Your
conclusions will be.

02:21:22.584 --> 02:21:24.886
And they'll have to be answered.

02:21:24.919 --> 02:21:26.388
Hoover passes them to McCarthy?

02:21:26.421 --> 02:21:30.025
Oppenheimer's too slippery
for that self-promoting clown.

02:21:30.058 --> 02:21:32.927
I've talked it over with Hoover,
he'll hold McCarthy at bay

02:21:32.961 --> 02:21:34.562
while you do this with the AEC.

02:21:34.596 --> 02:21:36.431
- A trial.
- No.

02:21:36.464 --> 02:21:40.235
No trial. You can't give
Oppenheimer a platform.

02:21:40.268 --> 02:21:42.037
You can't martyr him.

02:21:42.070 --> 02:21:45.240
We need a systematic destruction
of Oppenheimer's credibility

02:21:45.273 --> 02:21:48.843
so he can never again speak on
matters of national security.

02:21:48.877 --> 02:21:50.945
Then what?

02:21:52.147 --> 02:21:55.517
A shabby little room,
far from the limelight.

02:22:01.956 --> 02:22:03.234
<i>A simple
bureaucratic procedure.</i>

02:22:03.258 --> 02:22:05.894
His Q clearance
is up for renewal.

02:22:05.927 --> 02:22:08.897
You send your
accusations to the FBI.

02:22:10.532 --> 02:22:14.135
Hoover sends them to the
AEC, you're forced to act.

02:22:14.969 --> 02:22:16.271
You write up an indictment

02:22:16.304 --> 02:22:17.939
<i>and tell Oppenheimer</i>

02:22:17.972 --> 02:22:20.642
<i>his security clearance
is not being renewed.</i>

02:22:20.675 --> 02:22:22.210
<i>But offer him the
chance to appeal.</i>

02:22:22.243 --> 02:22:24.579
As you can see, Robert,
it's not yet signed.

02:22:24.612 --> 02:22:26.114
May I keep this?

02:22:26.147 --> 02:22:27.082
No.

02:22:27.115 --> 02:22:29.351
If you do decide to appeal,

02:22:29.384 --> 02:22:30.919
they'll have to send you a copy.

02:22:30.952 --> 02:22:34.189
When he appeals... and
trust me, he will...

02:22:34.222 --> 02:22:36.624
I appoint a board.

02:22:36.658 --> 02:22:39.127
They will, of
course, have counsel.

02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:41.096
- Prosecutor?
- In all but name.

02:22:41.129 --> 02:22:43.298
- Who?
- Roger Robb.

02:22:43.331 --> 02:22:44.499
Ouch.

02:22:44.532 --> 02:22:46.000
Robb will have
security clearance

02:22:46.034 --> 02:22:47.569
<i>to examine Oppenheimer's file.</i>

02:22:47.602 --> 02:22:49.037
<i>As will the Gray board.</i>

02:22:49.070 --> 02:22:50.438
Defense counsel will not.

02:22:52.273 --> 02:22:53.675
A closed hearing.

02:22:53.708 --> 02:22:54.952
<i>The so-called
derogatory information</i>

02:22:54.976 --> 02:22:57.145
in your indictment of me.

02:22:57.178 --> 02:22:59.647
No audience. No reporters.

02:22:59.681 --> 02:23:03.151
- No burden of proof.
- No burden of proof?

02:23:04.519 --> 02:23:06.020
We're not convicting.

02:23:06.721 --> 02:23:09.324
We're just denying.

02:23:14.295 --> 02:23:17.065
What is it you said?

02:23:17.098 --> 02:23:20.435
"This is just how
the game is played."

02:23:20.468 --> 02:23:23.438
Well, forgive my naivete.

02:23:23.471 --> 02:23:25.440
Amateurs seek the sun.

02:23:26.408 --> 02:23:27.475
Get eaten.

02:23:28.543 --> 02:23:31.379
Power stays in the shadows.

02:23:31.413 --> 02:23:35.116
But, sir, you're... you're
out of the shadows now.

02:23:35.150 --> 02:23:36.584
Yeah, that's why
this has to work.

02:23:36.618 --> 02:23:38.086
Well...

02:23:39.387 --> 02:23:41.523
Teller's testifying
this morning.

02:23:41.556 --> 02:23:43.958
That'll help. And then...

02:23:43.992 --> 02:23:45.427
Hill is in the afternoon.

02:23:45.460 --> 02:23:47.929
Hill is gonna help us too.

02:23:50.165 --> 02:23:53.334
As you can see,
Robert, it's not yet signed.

02:23:53.368 --> 02:23:54.402
May I keep this?

02:23:54.436 --> 02:23:55.470
No.

02:23:57.572 --> 02:23:59.574
If you do decide to appeal,

02:23:59.607 --> 02:24:02.444
then they'll have
to send you a copy.

02:24:06.014 --> 02:24:08.316
Take my car and
driver. I insist.

02:24:13.054 --> 02:24:14.989
I'll have to consult
my lawyers, Lewis.

02:24:15.023 --> 02:24:17.725
Of course. But
don't take too long.

02:24:17.759 --> 02:24:19.961
I can't keep Nichols at bay.

02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:28.403
I'm sorry it's come
to this, Robert.

02:24:28.436 --> 02:24:29.471
I think it's wrong.

02:24:42.784 --> 02:24:44.219
<i>Nichols
wants me to fight</i>

02:24:44.252 --> 02:24:46.254
<i>so he can get it
all on the record.</i>

02:24:46.287 --> 02:24:48.156
Strauss wants me to walk away.

02:24:48.189 --> 02:24:51.025
Strauss knows that
you can't do that,

02:24:51.059 --> 02:24:53.495
you'd be accepting the charges.

02:24:53.528 --> 02:24:55.196
You'll lose your job.

02:24:55.230 --> 02:24:57.499
You will lose your reputation.
We'll lose our house.

02:24:57.532 --> 02:25:00.235
Robert, we have to fight.

02:25:02.804 --> 02:25:05.106
As AEC Counsel,
I can't represent you.

02:25:05.139 --> 02:25:06.674
I'll call Lloyd Garrison.

02:25:06.708 --> 02:25:08.243
Oh, he's good.

02:25:08.276 --> 02:25:12.013
The best, but I
have to warn you...

02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:15.116
this won't be a fair fight.

02:25:15.149 --> 02:25:17.161
<i>During your interview</i>

02:25:17.185 --> 02:25:19.654
with Boris Pash in 1943,
did you refer to microfilm?

02:25:19.687 --> 02:25:21.189
- No.
- Tab 11,

02:25:21.222 --> 02:25:22.666
page one, paragraph
three. You never said,

02:25:22.690 --> 02:25:26.327
"Man at the consulate expert
in the use of microfilm"?

02:25:26.361 --> 02:25:27.695
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No.

02:25:27.729 --> 02:25:28.663
I would like to
know what document

02:25:28.696 --> 02:25:30.131
Mr. Robb is quoting from

02:25:30.164 --> 02:25:31.442
and if we might be
furnished with a copy.

02:25:31.466 --> 02:25:33.535
The document is
classified, Mr. Garrison.

02:25:33.568 --> 02:25:35.412
I think we should get back
to first-hand information.

02:25:35.436 --> 02:25:36.804
This is first-hand.

02:25:36.839 --> 02:25:39.107
How so, Roger?

02:25:40.475 --> 02:25:42.310
There was a recording
of the interview.

02:25:46.281 --> 02:25:48.182
You let
my client sit here

02:25:48.216 --> 02:25:49.717
and potentially perjure himself,

02:25:49.751 --> 02:25:52.287
and all this time,
you had a recording?

02:25:52.320 --> 02:25:53.688
Nobody told your client

02:25:53.721 --> 02:25:55.123
to misrepresent
his former answers.

02:25:55.156 --> 02:25:57.225
Misrepre... It-it
was 12 years ago.

02:25:57.258 --> 02:25:58.560
Can we hear this recording?

02:25:58.593 --> 02:26:00.170
You don't have the
clearance, Mr. Garrison.

02:26:00.194 --> 02:26:01.830
But you're reading
it into the record.

02:26:01.864 --> 02:26:03.498
Please, please.

02:26:03.531 --> 02:26:07.135
Is this proceeding interested
in entrapment or in truth?

02:26:07.168 --> 02:26:09.604
If it's truth, where's
the disclosure?

02:26:09.637 --> 02:26:11.272
Where's the witness list?

02:26:11.306 --> 02:26:13.842
Mr. Garrison, this isn't a
trial, as you are well aware.

02:26:13.876 --> 02:26:15.743
Evidentiary rules do not apply.

02:26:15.777 --> 02:26:17.645
We are dealing with
national security.

02:26:17.679 --> 02:26:19.180
Yes, sir, with all due respect,

02:26:19.213 --> 02:26:21.583
I fail to see how
national security

02:26:21.616 --> 02:26:23.318
prevents the prosecution
from providing us

02:26:23.351 --> 02:26:25.362
- with a list of witnesses.
- Perhaps we are in need

02:26:25.386 --> 02:26:26.697
- of a brief recess.
- Gentlemen,

02:26:26.721 --> 02:26:28.456
you have my words.

02:26:28.489 --> 02:26:30.634
If you say they're from a
transcript, then I'll accept it.

02:26:30.658 --> 02:26:33.428
I've already explained I made
up a cock-and-bull story.

02:26:33.461 --> 02:26:36.798
But why would anyone make
up such an elaborate story?

02:26:36.832 --> 02:26:38.901
Because I was an idiot.

02:26:38.934 --> 02:26:40.535
Why lie?

02:26:40.568 --> 02:26:43.171
Well, clearly with the
intention of not revealing

02:26:43.204 --> 02:26:45.273
who the intermediary was.

02:26:45.306 --> 02:26:47.342
Your friend, Haakon
Chevalier, the Communist.

02:26:47.375 --> 02:26:49.644
Is he still your friend?

02:26:49.677 --> 02:26:51.112
Yes.

02:26:53.214 --> 02:26:56.150
Dr. Rabi,
thank you for coming.

02:26:56.184 --> 02:26:57.896
Do you know who else the
prosecution has called?

02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:00.254
Teller, obviously.

02:27:01.222 --> 02:27:02.490
They've asked Lawrence.

02:27:02.523 --> 02:27:03.358
What did he say?

02:27:03.391 --> 02:27:06.294
He wasn't going to
help them, but...

02:27:06.327 --> 02:27:07.261
But?

02:27:07.295 --> 02:27:09.297
Strauss told him that
you and Ruth Tolman

02:27:09.330 --> 02:27:11.766
<i>have been having an
affair for years.</i>

02:27:11.799 --> 02:27:12.901
<i>The whole time you lived</i>

02:27:12.935 --> 02:27:14.569
with them in Pasadena.

02:27:14.602 --> 02:27:16.270
He convinced Lawrence

02:27:16.304 --> 02:27:17.873
that Richard died
of a broken heart.

02:27:17.906 --> 02:27:19.207
That's absurd.

02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:21.776
- What part?
- The broken heart.

02:27:21.810 --> 02:27:23.846
Richard never found out.

02:27:23.879 --> 02:27:25.647
Is Lawrence gonna testify?

02:27:25.680 --> 02:27:27.181
I don't know.

02:27:27.715 --> 02:27:29.350
Dr. Rabi,

02:27:29.384 --> 02:27:32.453
what governmental positions
do you currently hold?

02:27:32.487 --> 02:27:35.390
I am the chairman of the
General Advisory Committee

02:27:35.423 --> 02:27:38.326
to the AEC, succeeding
Dr. Oppenheimer.

02:27:38.359 --> 02:27:41.195
And how long have
you known Dr. Oppenheimer?

02:27:41.229 --> 02:27:42.831
Since 1928.

02:27:42.865 --> 02:27:44.933
I... I know him quite well.

02:27:44.967 --> 02:27:46.935
Well enough to
speak to the bearing

02:27:46.969 --> 02:27:49.537
of his loyalty and character?

02:27:49.570 --> 02:27:53.574
Dr. Oppenheimer is a man
of upstanding character.

02:27:53.608 --> 02:27:56.277
And he is loyal to
the United States,

02:27:56.310 --> 02:27:57.545
to his friends,

02:27:57.578 --> 02:28:00.248
to the institutions
of which he is part.

02:28:01.716 --> 02:28:02.750
Eat.

02:28:21.736 --> 02:28:23.438
What was that?

02:28:23.471 --> 02:28:25.506
Nothing to worry about.

02:28:27.742 --> 02:28:29.477
<i>After the
Russian A-bomb test,</i>

02:28:29.510 --> 02:28:31.980
did Dr. Lawrence come to see
you about the hydrogen bomb?

02:28:32.014 --> 02:28:33.816
You'd be better off asking him.

02:28:33.849 --> 02:28:35.383
Well, I fully intend to.

02:28:35.416 --> 02:28:37.986
Would you say that
Dr. Oppenheimer was

02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:40.022
unalterably opposed
to the H-bomb?

02:28:40.055 --> 02:28:42.858
No, he-he thought
that a fusion program

02:28:42.891 --> 02:28:45.994
would come at the expense of our
awfully good fission program.

02:28:46.028 --> 02:28:47.863
But that proved
not to be the case.

02:28:47.896 --> 02:28:50.531
In the event both could be done.

02:28:50.565 --> 02:28:52.868
Suppose that this board
did not feel satisfied

02:28:52.901 --> 02:28:54.036
that in his testimony here,

02:28:54.069 --> 02:28:56.337
Dr. Oppenheimer had
been wholly truthful.

02:28:56.370 --> 02:28:59.574
What would you say whether
or not he should be cleared?

02:28:59.607 --> 02:29:01.509
Why go through all
this against a man

02:29:01.542 --> 02:29:03.745
who has accomplished
what Dr. Oppenheimer has?

02:29:03.778 --> 02:29:05.413
Look at his record.

02:29:05.446 --> 02:29:07.515
We have an A-bomb and
a whole series of it.

02:29:07.548 --> 02:29:09.484
We have a whole
series of Super bombs.

02:29:09.517 --> 02:29:11.486
What more do you want?

02:29:11.519 --> 02:29:12.386
Mermaids?

02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:14.722
But I've known
Secretary Strauss

02:29:14.756 --> 02:29:16.357
for many years,

02:29:16.390 --> 02:29:19.660
and I feel it a necessity
to express the warm support

02:29:19.694 --> 02:29:22.363
for science and scientists
Lewis has shown.

02:29:22.396 --> 02:29:23.631
We'll break now,

02:29:23.664 --> 02:29:25.466
unless there's any
immediate business.

02:29:25.500 --> 02:29:28.036
Senator, I'd
like to once again request

02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:30.738
that we're furnished
with a list of witnesses.

02:29:30.772 --> 02:29:33.541
And I will remind the
nominee that we don't always

02:29:33.574 --> 02:29:35.576
have that information
in advance.

02:29:35.610 --> 02:29:39.047
We do know that Dr. Hill
will be here after lunch.

02:29:39.081 --> 02:29:40.715
Mr. Chairman, our next
scheduled witness,

02:29:40.748 --> 02:29:45.286
Dr. Lawrence, has apparently
come down with colitis.

02:29:46.754 --> 02:29:49.657
So we'll proceed with
William Borden instead.

02:29:50.926 --> 02:29:52.326
Mr. Borden, welcome.

02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:53.829
Please take a seat.

02:29:54.997 --> 02:29:57.398
Mr. Borden,

02:29:57.431 --> 02:30:00.002
during your investigation
into Dr. Oppenheimer,

02:30:00.035 --> 02:30:01.669
did you reach
certain conclusions?

02:30:01.702 --> 02:30:04.006
- I did.
- And did there come a time

02:30:04.039 --> 02:30:05.506
when you expressed
those conclusions

02:30:05.540 --> 02:30:07.542
in a letter to
Mr. J. Edgar Hoover

02:30:07.575 --> 02:30:09.510
of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation?

02:30:09.544 --> 02:30:10.955
- That is correct.
- Prior to the writing

02:30:10.979 --> 02:30:12.756
of the letter, did you discuss
the writing of the letter

02:30:12.780 --> 02:30:15.083
with anybody attached to the
Atomic Energy Commission?

02:30:15.117 --> 02:30:16.717
I did not.

02:30:16.751 --> 02:30:18.096
Thanks, and do you
have a copy of the letter?

02:30:18.120 --> 02:30:19.720
I have one
in front of me.

02:30:19.754 --> 02:30:21.857
Would you please be so
kind as to read it, sir?

02:30:21.890 --> 02:30:23.424
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

02:30:23.457 --> 02:30:24.903
the purpose of this
letter is to state..."

02:30:24.927 --> 02:30:26.971
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, if I could have a...

02:30:26.995 --> 02:30:29.363
What is the purpose
of the delay?

02:30:29.397 --> 02:30:30.866
He's simply gonna
read the letter.

02:30:30.899 --> 02:30:32.433
Mr. Chairman,

02:30:32.466 --> 02:30:34.468
this is the first I've
seen of this letter,

02:30:34.502 --> 02:30:35.770
and I see statements here, uh,

02:30:35.803 --> 02:30:37.772
at least one, of a
kind that I don't think

02:30:37.805 --> 02:30:39.774
anyone would like to
see go into the record.

02:30:39.807 --> 02:30:42.577
These are accusations that
have not previously been made.

02:30:42.610 --> 02:30:44.545
That are not part of the
indictment from Nichols.

02:30:44.579 --> 02:30:46.714
Accusations of a kind that
I don't think belong here.

02:30:46.747 --> 02:30:48.917
The witness wrote this
letter on his own initiative,

02:30:48.951 --> 02:30:51.519
laying out evidence that has
already been before the board.

02:30:51.552 --> 02:30:53.155
His conclusions are
valid testimony,

02:30:53.188 --> 02:30:55.090
just like the... the
positive conclusions

02:30:55.123 --> 02:30:56.457
of friends of Dr. Oppenheimer.

02:30:56.490 --> 02:30:57.993
It cuts both ways.

02:30:58.026 --> 02:31:00.461
How long has Counsel been in
possession of this letter?

02:31:00.494 --> 02:31:01.864
I don't think I
should be subject

02:31:01.897 --> 02:31:04.465
to cross-examination
by you, Mr. Garrison.

02:31:04.498 --> 02:31:06.144
Mr. Garrison, given
that we on the board

02:31:06.168 --> 02:31:07.668
have all read the letter,

02:31:07.702 --> 02:31:10.038
wouldn't it be better to
have it in the record?

02:31:10.072 --> 02:31:11.539
Let's proceed.

02:31:13.541 --> 02:31:15.010
"Dear Mr. Hoover,

02:31:15.043 --> 02:31:18.479
"the purpose of this letter
is to state my opinion

02:31:18.512 --> 02:31:19.815
"based upon years of study

02:31:19.848 --> 02:31:22.617
"of the available
classified evidence,

02:31:22.650 --> 02:31:24.685
"that more probably than not,

02:31:24.719 --> 02:31:29.590
"J. Robert Oppenheimer is an
agent of the Soviet Union.

02:31:29.624 --> 02:31:31.960
"The following
conclusions are justified.

02:31:31.994 --> 02:31:36.832
"One, between 1929 and 1942,
more probably than not,

02:31:36.865 --> 02:31:38.166
"J. Robert Oppenheimer

02:31:38.200 --> 02:31:40.501
"was a sufficiently
hardened Communist,

02:31:40.534 --> 02:31:42.637
"that he volunteered
information to the Soviets.

02:31:42.670 --> 02:31:45.007
"Two, more probably than not,

02:31:45.040 --> 02:31:49.610
"he has since been functioning
as an espionage agent.

02:31:49.644 --> 02:31:52.480
"Three, more probably than not,

02:31:52.513 --> 02:31:54.749
"he has since acted
under a Soviet directive

02:31:54.782 --> 02:31:57.518
in influencing United
States military policy..."

02:31:57.551 --> 02:31:58.786
I'm sorry, Robert.

02:31:58.820 --> 02:32:00.164
"atomic
energy, intelligence

02:32:00.188 --> 02:32:01.565
- and diplomatic policy."
- Is anyone

02:32:01.589 --> 02:32:03.225
ever going to tell the truth

02:32:03.258 --> 02:32:05.027
about what's happening here?

02:32:05.060 --> 02:32:08.596
<i>We will
now hear from Dr. David Hill.</i>

02:32:17.839 --> 02:32:19.174
Dr. Hill,

02:32:19.207 --> 02:32:21.843
would you care to
make a statement?

02:32:22.978 --> 02:32:24.545
Thank you.

02:32:24.578 --> 02:32:28.250
I've been asked to testify
about Lewis Strauss.

02:32:28.283 --> 02:32:30.685
A man who has given
years of service

02:32:30.718 --> 02:32:33.688
in high positions of government

02:32:33.721 --> 02:32:38.659
and who is known to be earnest,
hardworking and intelligent.

02:32:39.660 --> 02:32:41.172
The views I have to
express are my own,

02:32:41.196 --> 02:32:44.900
but I believe that much I have
to say will help to indicate

02:32:44.933 --> 02:32:48.636
why most of the
scientists in this country

02:32:48.669 --> 02:32:51.672
would prefer to see Mr. Strauss

02:32:51.706 --> 02:32:53.541
completely out of government.

02:32:55.576 --> 02:32:58.080
You're... You're
referring to the hostility

02:32:58.113 --> 02:32:59.580
of certain scientists

02:32:59.613 --> 02:33:01.249
directed toward Mr. Strauss

02:33:01.283 --> 02:33:03.517
because of his
commitment to security

02:33:03.551 --> 02:33:06.554
as demonstrated in the
Oppenheimer affair?

02:33:09.024 --> 02:33:10.292
No.

02:33:10.325 --> 02:33:12.727
Because of the
personal vindictiveness

02:33:12.760 --> 02:33:14.997
he demonstrated against
Dr. Oppenheimer.

02:33:16.664 --> 02:33:18.799
Order.

02:33:18.834 --> 02:33:19.868
Order!

02:33:19.901 --> 02:33:25.173
It appears to most scientists
around this country

02:33:25.207 --> 02:33:26.741
that Robert Oppenheimer
is now being

02:33:26.774 --> 02:33:29.011
pilloried and put
through an ordeal

02:33:29.044 --> 02:33:32.147
because he expressed
his honest opinions.

02:33:33.148 --> 02:33:35.217
Dr. Bush, I thought I
was performing a service

02:33:35.250 --> 02:33:36.985
to my country when
hearing this case.

02:33:37.019 --> 02:33:41.156
No board in this country
should sit in judgment of a man

02:33:41.189 --> 02:33:43.825
because he expressed
strong opinions.

02:33:43.859 --> 02:33:46.928
If you want to try that
case, you should try me.

02:33:46.962 --> 02:33:50.966
Excuse me, gentlemen,
if I become stirred,

02:33:50.999 --> 02:33:52.200
but I am.

02:33:52.234 --> 02:33:54.202
Dr. Hill, we've already heard

02:33:54.236 --> 02:33:56.670
that Mr. Strauss did
not bring the charges

02:33:56.704 --> 02:33:59.774
or participate in the hearings
against Dr. Oppenheimer.

02:33:59.807 --> 02:34:02.310
The Oppenheimer matter was

02:34:02.344 --> 02:34:04.712
initiated and carried through

02:34:04.745 --> 02:34:07.115
largely through the
animus of Lewis Strauss.

02:34:08.716 --> 02:34:11.353
Oppenheimer made mincemeat
out of Strauss's position

02:34:11.386 --> 02:34:12.988
on the shipment of
isotopes to Norway,

02:34:13.021 --> 02:34:17.025
and Strauss never forgave
him this public humiliation.

02:34:17.059 --> 02:34:19.660
Another controversy between
them centered around

02:34:19.693 --> 02:34:22.663
their differences in
judgment on how the H-bomb

02:34:22.696 --> 02:34:24.765
<i>would contribute to
national security.</i>

02:34:24.799 --> 02:34:26.767
Strauss turned to the
personnel security system

02:34:26.801 --> 02:34:31.039
in order to destroy
Oppenheimer's effectiveness,

02:34:31.073 --> 02:34:33.607
and Strauss was able to
find a few ambitious men

02:34:33.641 --> 02:34:36.677
who also disagreed with
Oppenheimer's positions

02:34:36.710 --> 02:34:39.747
and envied him his prestige
in government circles.

02:34:39.780 --> 02:34:42.384
I've always
assumed, and still assume,

02:34:42.417 --> 02:34:44.652
that he's loyal to
the United States.

02:34:44.685 --> 02:34:46.097
I believe this. And
I shall believe it

02:34:46.121 --> 02:34:48.689
until I see very conclusive
proof to the opposite.

02:34:48.722 --> 02:34:50.691
Do you or do you not believe

02:34:50.724 --> 02:34:53.028
that Dr. Oppenheimer
is a security risk?

02:34:56.764 --> 02:34:58.033
In a great number of cases,

02:34:58.066 --> 02:35:00.035
I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer
act in a way

02:35:00.068 --> 02:35:03.939
which was to me exceedingly
hard to understand.

02:35:03.972 --> 02:35:05.974
I thoroughly disagreed with
him in numerous issues,

02:35:06.007 --> 02:35:08.110
and his actions
frankly appeared to me

02:35:08.143 --> 02:35:09.677
confused and complicated.

02:35:09.710 --> 02:35:11.246
To this extent, I feel,

02:35:11.279 --> 02:35:14.382
I want to see the vital
interest of this country

02:35:14.416 --> 02:35:16.251
in hands which I
understand better

02:35:16.284 --> 02:35:18.420
and therefore trust more.

02:35:18.453 --> 02:35:21.223
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Thank you.

02:35:25.026 --> 02:35:26.128
I'm sorry.

02:35:28.762 --> 02:35:30.932
<i>You shook
his fucking hand?</i>

02:35:30.966 --> 02:35:33.869
Oh, I would have
spit in his face.

02:35:33.902 --> 02:35:35.446
Not sure the board would
have appreciated that.

02:35:35.470 --> 02:35:37.048
Is it not
gentlemanly enough for you?

02:35:37.072 --> 02:35:40.408
Well, I-I think you're all
being too goddamn gentlemanly.

02:35:40.442 --> 02:35:42.410
Gray must see what
Robb is doing.

02:35:42.444 --> 02:35:44.379
Why doesn't he
just shut him down?

02:35:44.412 --> 02:35:47.015
And you shaking Teller's hand.

02:35:47.048 --> 02:35:49.918
You need to stop
playing the martyr.

02:35:50.919 --> 02:35:53.321
Under the current
AEC guidelines,

02:35:53.355 --> 02:35:55.756
would you clear
Dr. Oppenheimer today?

02:36:01.930 --> 02:36:04.299
Under my interpretation

02:36:04.332 --> 02:36:06.468
of the Atomic Energy Act,

02:36:06.501 --> 02:36:08.336
which did not exist

02:36:08.370 --> 02:36:11.206
when I hired
Dr. Oppenheimer in 1942...

02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:15.844
I would not clear him today,

02:36:15.877 --> 02:36:17.846
uh, if I were on the commission.

02:36:17.879 --> 02:36:19.457
Good. Thank you,
General. That is all.

02:36:19.481 --> 02:36:21.483
But I don't think I'd
clear any of those guys.

02:36:21.516 --> 02:36:23.684
That's all.

02:36:26.188 --> 02:36:28.323
Dr. Oppenheimer
had no responsibility

02:36:28.356 --> 02:36:29.858
in the selection
or the clearance

02:36:29.891 --> 02:36:31.193
of Klaus Fuchs, did he?

02:36:31.226 --> 02:36:32.494
No. None at all.

02:36:32.527 --> 02:36:34.129
And you wouldn't want
to leave this board

02:36:34.162 --> 02:36:36.932
with any suggestion today
that you're here questioning

02:36:36.965 --> 02:36:39.000
his basic loyalty
to the United States

02:36:39.034 --> 02:36:40.435
in the operation of Los Alamos?

02:36:40.468 --> 02:36:42.037
By no means.

02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:44.072
I hope I didn't lead
anyone to believe otherwise

02:36:44.105 --> 02:36:45.739
for an instant.

02:36:45.773 --> 02:36:46.875
Thank you, General.

02:37:04.926 --> 02:37:07.195
Okay. We shouldn't
keep them waiting.

02:37:07.229 --> 02:37:08.496
She'll be here.

02:37:08.530 --> 02:37:09.965
Do you even want her here?

02:37:09.998 --> 02:37:12.500
Only a fool or an adolescent

02:37:12.534 --> 02:37:14.436
presumes to know someone
else's relationship,

02:37:14.469 --> 02:37:16.770
and you're neither, Lloyd.

02:37:18.340 --> 02:37:20.308
Kitty and I,

02:37:20.342 --> 02:37:22.410
we're grown-ups.

02:37:22.444 --> 02:37:25.280
<i>We've walked through
fire together.</i>

02:37:25.313 --> 02:37:27.882
She'll do fine.

02:37:27.916 --> 02:37:29.985
Would you describe
your views on Communism

02:37:30.018 --> 02:37:32.053
as pro, anti, neutral?

02:37:32.087 --> 02:37:33.955
Very strongly against.

02:37:33.989 --> 02:37:36.124
I-I've had nothing to do
with Communism in... since...

02:37:36.157 --> 02:37:38.994
since 1936, since...

02:37:39.027 --> 02:37:41.896
since before I met Robert.

02:37:42.497 --> 02:37:44.332
That's all.

02:37:44.366 --> 02:37:45.934
<i>The record demonstrates</i>

02:37:45.967 --> 02:37:47.569
<i>that Oppenheimer
was not interrogated</i>

02:37:47.602 --> 02:37:50.839
<i>by impartial and disinterested
counsel for the Gray board.</i>

02:37:50.872 --> 02:37:52.274
<i>He was interrogated
by a prosecutor</i>

02:37:52.307 --> 02:37:53.975
<i>who used all the tricks</i>

02:37:54.009 --> 02:37:55.810
<i>of a rather ingenious
legal background.</i>

02:37:55.844 --> 02:37:57.279
You
are charging now

02:37:57.312 --> 02:38:00.282
that the Gray board
permitted a prosecution.

02:38:00.315 --> 02:38:03.018
If I were on the Gray board,

02:38:03.051 --> 02:38:05.020
I would have protested
against the tactics

02:38:05.053 --> 02:38:07.956
of the man who served, in fact,
as the prosecuting counsel.

02:38:07.989 --> 02:38:11.192
A man appointed not by the board

02:38:11.226 --> 02:38:13.295
but by Lewis Strauss.

02:38:15.297 --> 02:38:16.331
Who was this?

02:38:17.632 --> 02:38:19.467
I'm sorry?

02:38:19.501 --> 02:38:20.568
Who was this?

02:38:20.602 --> 02:38:22.037
Uh, Roger Robb.

02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:24.406
Mrs. Oppenheimer.

02:38:28.610 --> 02:38:31.046
Did you have a Communist
Party membership card?

02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:34.582
I'm... I'm not sure.

02:38:34.616 --> 02:38:36.117
Not sure?

02:38:39.087 --> 02:38:40.088
Well...

02:38:42.490 --> 02:38:44.225
Well?

02:38:53.168 --> 02:38:56.137
I mean, presumably, the
act of joining the Party

02:38:56.171 --> 02:38:59.941
required sending some money
and receiving a card, no?

02:39:03.111 --> 02:39:04.245
Yeah.

02:39:09.617 --> 02:39:11.019
Sorry.

02:39:11.653 --> 02:39:13.254
Yes. Mm.

02:39:15.090 --> 02:39:17.092
It's just it was all
so very long ago,

02:39:17.125 --> 02:39:18.960
- Mr. Robb, wasn't it?
- Not really.

02:39:18.993 --> 02:39:20.228
Long enough to have forgotten.

02:39:20.261 --> 02:39:21.639
Did you return the
card or rip it up?

02:39:21.663 --> 02:39:23.264
The card whose existence
I've forgotten?

02:39:23.298 --> 02:39:25.100
Your Communist Party
membership card.

02:39:25.133 --> 02:39:26.868
Haven't the slightest idea.

02:39:29.170 --> 02:39:31.940
Can a distinction
be made between

02:39:31.973 --> 02:39:33.641
Soviet Communism and Communism?

02:39:33.675 --> 02:39:35.243
Well, in the days
when I was a member,

02:39:35.276 --> 02:39:36.916
I thought they were
definitely two things.

02:39:36.945 --> 02:39:38.213
- Oh?
- I thought that

02:39:38.246 --> 02:39:40.115
the Communist Party
of the United States

02:39:40.148 --> 02:39:42.550
was concerned with
our domestic problems.

02:39:42.584 --> 02:39:44.052
I now no longer believe this.

02:39:44.085 --> 02:39:45.129
Believe the whole
thing's linked together

02:39:45.153 --> 02:39:46.421
and spread all over the world,

02:39:46.454 --> 02:39:48.656
and I have believed this
since I left the Party

02:39:48.690 --> 02:39:50.158
16 years ago.

02:39:50.191 --> 02:39:51.493
- But...
- Seventeen years ago.

02:39:51.526 --> 02:39:52.927
My mistake.

02:39:52.961 --> 02:39:55.597
- But you said...
- Sorry, 18.

02:39:55.630 --> 02:39:57.899
Eighteen years ago.

02:39:58.700 --> 02:40:00.010
Are you
familiar with the fact

02:40:00.034 --> 02:40:01.212
your husband was
making contributions

02:40:01.236 --> 02:40:04.305
to the Spanish Civil
War as late as 1942?

02:40:04.339 --> 02:40:06.217
I knew that Robert gave
money from time to time.

02:40:06.241 --> 02:40:07.485
Did you know this
money was going

02:40:07.509 --> 02:40:08.943
into Communist Party channels?

02:40:08.977 --> 02:40:10.412
Don't you mean "through"?

02:40:10.445 --> 02:40:12.213
- Pardon?
- I think you mean

02:40:12.247 --> 02:40:14.048
"through Communist Party
channels," don't you?

02:40:14.082 --> 02:40:15.316
- Y-Yes!
- Yes?

02:40:15.350 --> 02:40:17.252
- Yes!
- Yes.

02:40:17.285 --> 02:40:20.989
Then would it be fair to say
that this meant that by 1942,

02:40:21.022 --> 02:40:22.323
your husband had not stopped

02:40:22.357 --> 02:40:24.292
having anything to do
with the Communist Party?

02:40:24.325 --> 02:40:26.127
You don't have to
answer that yes or no.

02:40:26.161 --> 02:40:27.538
You can answer that
any way you wish.

02:40:27.562 --> 02:40:29.431
I know that, thank you.

02:40:29.464 --> 02:40:31.166
It's your question.

02:40:31.199 --> 02:40:33.101
- It's not properly phrased.
- Do you understand

02:40:33.134 --> 02:40:34.369
- what I'm getting at?
- I do.

02:40:34.402 --> 02:40:35.679
Then why don't you
answer it that way?

02:40:35.703 --> 02:40:37.305
'Cause I don't like your phrase.

02:40:37.338 --> 02:40:39.274
"Having anything to do
with the Communist Party."

02:40:39.307 --> 02:40:41.109
Because Robert never
had anything to do

02:40:41.142 --> 02:40:42.444
with the Communist
Party as such.

02:40:42.477 --> 02:40:45.113
I know he gave money
to Spanish refugees.

02:40:45.146 --> 02:40:47.081
I know he took an
intellectual interest

02:40:47.115 --> 02:40:48.316
in Communist ideas...

02:40:48.349 --> 02:40:49.460
Are there two types
of Communists?

02:40:49.484 --> 02:40:51.186
Intellectual Communists

02:40:51.219 --> 02:40:53.154
and your plain old
regular Commie?

02:40:54.155 --> 02:40:55.723
Well, I couldn't
answer that one.

02:40:55.757 --> 02:40:58.526
I
couldn't either.

02:41:04.666 --> 02:41:06.468
Evening.

02:41:06.501 --> 02:41:08.236
Robert, you
can't win this thing.

02:41:08.269 --> 02:41:10.214
It's a kangaroo court with
a predetermined outcome.

02:41:10.238 --> 02:41:12.173
Why put yourself
through more of it?

02:41:12.774 --> 02:41:15.210
I have my reasons.

02:41:15.811 --> 02:41:17.245
All right.

02:41:17.278 --> 02:41:18.413
Good night.

02:41:23.117 --> 02:41:24.519
He has a point.

02:41:25.453 --> 02:41:27.489
I'm not sure you
understand, Albert.

02:41:27.522 --> 02:41:28.623
No?

02:41:28.656 --> 02:41:32.160
I left my country
never to return.

02:41:32.794 --> 02:41:34.762
You served your country well.

02:41:34.796 --> 02:41:38.433
If this is the reward
she offers you, then...

02:41:38.466 --> 02:41:42.103
perhaps you should
turn your back on her.

02:41:42.136 --> 02:41:44.772
Damn it, I happen to
love this country.

02:41:44.806 --> 02:41:47.408
Then tell them to go to hell.

02:41:47.442 --> 02:41:48.343
Interestingly enough,

02:41:48.376 --> 02:41:51.446
this is no longer a
confirmation hearing,

02:41:51.479 --> 02:41:53.648
it's now a trial...

02:41:53.681 --> 02:41:55.416
about a trial!

02:41:56.417 --> 02:41:57.728
It's not good he's
telling everyone

02:41:57.752 --> 02:41:59.053
you initiated the hearings.

02:41:59.087 --> 02:42:01.456
He can't prove a goddamn thing.

02:42:01.489 --> 02:42:04.158
He certainly can't prove that
I gave the file to Borden.

02:42:04.192 --> 02:42:06.528
We're not in court, sir.

02:42:06.561 --> 02:42:07.762
There's no burden of proof.

02:42:07.795 --> 02:42:10.164
Right. They're not convicting...

02:42:10.198 --> 02:42:11.466
just denying.

02:42:11.499 --> 02:42:14.402
Why would Hill come
here to tear me down?

02:42:14.435 --> 02:42:16.070
What's his angle?

02:42:16.104 --> 02:42:18.206
Do people need a reason
to do the right thing?

02:42:18.239 --> 02:42:19.842
- As he sees it.
- I told you,

02:42:19.875 --> 02:42:22.544
Oppenheimer poisoned the
scientists against me,

02:42:22.577 --> 02:42:24.279
right from that first meeting.

02:42:24.312 --> 02:42:27.549
<i>I don't know what Oppenheimer
said to him that day,</i>

02:42:27.582 --> 02:42:30.318
but Einstein wouldn't
even meet my eye.

02:42:31.419 --> 02:42:34.522
<i>Oppenheimer knows how
to manipulate his own.</i>

02:42:34.556 --> 02:42:35.824
And at Los Alamos,

02:42:35.858 --> 02:42:38.192
he preyed on the
naivete of scientists

02:42:38.226 --> 02:42:40.528
who thought they'd get a say
in how we used their work,

02:42:40.562 --> 02:42:43.565
but don't ever think he
was that naive himself.

02:42:43.598 --> 02:42:44.867
Doctor.

02:42:44.900 --> 02:42:46.869
During your work on
the hydrogen bomb,

02:42:46.902 --> 02:42:50.572
were you deterred
by any moral qualms?

02:42:50.605 --> 02:42:52.240
Yes, of course.

02:42:52.273 --> 02:42:53.584
But you still got on
with your work, didn't you?

02:42:53.608 --> 02:42:55.844
Yes, because this was
work of exploration,

02:42:55.878 --> 02:42:58.112
it was not the
preparation of a weapon.

02:42:58.146 --> 02:43:00.214
You mean it was more of
a... an academic excursion.

02:43:00.248 --> 02:43:02.150
No, it is not an academic thing

02:43:02.183 --> 02:43:03.594
whether you can build
a hydrogen bomb.

02:43:03.618 --> 02:43:05.219
It's a matter of life and death.

02:43:05.253 --> 02:43:06.621
By 1942, you were
actively pushing

02:43:06.654 --> 02:43:08.232
the development of the
hydrogen bomb, weren't you?

02:43:08.256 --> 02:43:09.490
Pushing's not the right word.

02:43:09.524 --> 02:43:11.459
Supporting it and
working on it, yes.

02:43:11.492 --> 02:43:13.829
So when did these moral
qualms become so strong

02:43:13.862 --> 02:43:15.496
that you actively opposed

02:43:15.530 --> 02:43:17.198
the development of
the hydrogen bomb?

02:43:17.231 --> 02:43:19.200
When it was suggested
that it be the policy

02:43:19.233 --> 02:43:21.402
of the United States to make
these things at all cost

02:43:21.436 --> 02:43:23.438
without regard to the
balance between these weapons

02:43:23.471 --> 02:43:26.541
and atomic weapons as
part of our arsenal.

02:43:27.910 --> 02:43:29.845
What do moral qualms
have to do with that?

02:43:29.878 --> 02:43:31.914
Wha... What do moral qualms

02:43:31.947 --> 02:43:33.481
- have to do with it?
- Yes.

02:43:33.514 --> 02:43:35.583
Oppenheimer wanted to
own the atomic bomb.

02:43:35.617 --> 02:43:37.518
He wanted to be the man
who moved the Earth.

02:43:37.552 --> 02:43:40.722
He talks about putting
the nuclear genie

02:43:40.755 --> 02:43:42.223
back in the bottle.

02:43:42.256 --> 02:43:43.391
Well, I'm here to tell you

02:43:43.424 --> 02:43:45.627
that I know J.
Robert Oppenheimer,

02:43:45.660 --> 02:43:49.764
and if he could do it all
over, he'd do it all the same.

02:43:49.797 --> 02:43:52.835
You know he's never once said
that he regrets Hiroshima?

02:43:52.868 --> 02:43:55.737
He'd do it all over. Why?

02:43:55.770 --> 02:43:57.205
Because it made him

02:43:57.238 --> 02:43:58.874
the most important
man who ever lived.

02:43:58.907 --> 02:44:01.242
Well, we've...

02:44:01.275 --> 02:44:03.378
we've freely used
the atomic bomb...

02:44:03.411 --> 02:44:05.513
In fact, Doctor,
you assisted in selecting

02:44:05.546 --> 02:44:06.958
the target to drop the
atomic bomb on Japan,

02:44:06.982 --> 02:44:08.650
- didn't you?
- Yes.

02:44:08.683 --> 02:44:10.327
Well, then you knew,
did you not, that by dropping

02:44:10.351 --> 02:44:12.520
that atomic bomb on the
target you selected,

02:44:12.553 --> 02:44:13.965
that thousands of
civilians would be killed

02:44:13.989 --> 02:44:15.723
or injured, is that correct?

02:44:15.757 --> 02:44:17.659
Yes, not as many
as turned out...

02:44:17.692 --> 02:44:19.895
Oh. Well, how many
were killed or injured?

02:44:19.928 --> 02:44:21.796
- 70,000.
- 70,000

02:44:21.830 --> 02:44:22.898
at both Hiroshima and...

02:44:22.931 --> 02:44:24.365
110,000 at both.

02:44:24.399 --> 02:44:25.800
On the day
of each bombing?

02:44:27.769 --> 02:44:28.937
Yes.

02:44:28.971 --> 02:44:30.547
And in the weeks and
years that followed?

02:44:30.571 --> 02:44:33.274
It has been put at somewhere
between 50 and 100,000.

02:44:33.307 --> 02:44:35.410
- 220,000 dead at least?
- Yes.

02:44:35.443 --> 02:44:37.345
Any moral scruples about that?

02:44:38.713 --> 02:44:39.815
Terrible ones.

02:44:39.848 --> 02:44:41.416
But yet you testified in here

02:44:41.449 --> 02:44:43.819
that the bombing of Hiroshima
was very successful.

02:44:43.852 --> 02:44:45.420
- Technically successful.
- Oh!

02:44:45.453 --> 02:44:47.221
Technically, it was
very successful.

02:44:47.255 --> 02:44:48.732
And it is also alleged to
have helped end the war.

02:44:48.756 --> 02:44:50.725
Would you have been in
support of the dropping

02:44:50.758 --> 02:44:52.694
of a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima?

02:44:52.727 --> 02:44:54.262
That would make no sense at all.

02:44:54.295 --> 02:44:56.731
- Why?
- The-the target is too small.

02:44:56.764 --> 02:44:59.267
Well, supposing there had
been a target in Japan

02:44:59.300 --> 02:45:00.778
big enough for a
thermonuclear weapon,

02:45:00.802 --> 02:45:02.579
would you have been opposed
to the dropping of it?

02:45:02.603 --> 02:45:04.448
This was not a problem with
which I was confronted...

02:45:04.472 --> 02:45:05.917
Well, I'm confronting
you with it now, sir.

02:45:05.941 --> 02:45:07.709
It was all part of his plan.

02:45:07.742 --> 02:45:09.310
He wanted the glorious,

02:45:09.343 --> 02:45:11.512
insincere guilt of
the self-important

02:45:11.546 --> 02:45:13.015
to wear like a fuckin' crown.

02:45:13.048 --> 02:45:16.484
Say, "No, we cannot
go down this road,"

02:45:16.517 --> 02:45:19.320
even as he knew we'd have to.

02:45:19.353 --> 02:45:20.899
Would you have been
opposed to the dropping

02:45:20.923 --> 02:45:22.590
of a thermonuclear
weapon on Japan

02:45:22.623 --> 02:45:24.869
- because of moral scruples?
- Yes, I believe I would, sir.

02:45:24.893 --> 02:45:26.594
Well, did you
oppose the dropping

02:45:26.627 --> 02:45:28.639
of an atomic bomb on Hiroshima
because of moral scruples?

02:45:28.663 --> 02:45:30.307
We set forth our arguments...

02:45:30.331 --> 02:45:31.733
No, you, you, you.
I'm asking you.

02:45:31.766 --> 02:45:33.410
- I set... I set forth...
- Not we. You, you, you!

02:45:33.434 --> 02:45:35.037
Our arguments
against dropping it,

02:45:35.070 --> 02:45:36.604
but I did not endorse them.

02:45:36.637 --> 02:45:38.339
You mean after
working night and day

02:45:38.372 --> 02:45:39.741
for three years
building the bomb,

02:45:39.774 --> 02:45:41.614
you then argued against
the use of it?

02:45:41.642 --> 02:45:44.345
I was asked by the
Secretary of War

02:45:44.378 --> 02:45:45.747
what the views of
scientists were.

02:45:45.780 --> 02:45:48.516
I gave him the views
against and the views for.

02:45:48.549 --> 02:45:50.561
You supported the dropping
of the atom bomb on Japan.

02:45:50.585 --> 02:45:52.063
- What do you mean "support"?
- Didn't you?

02:45:52.087 --> 02:45:53.564
- You supported it!
- What do you mean "support"?

02:45:53.588 --> 02:45:54.933
Well, you helped pick
the target, didn't you?

02:45:54.957 --> 02:45:56.591
I did my job.

02:45:56.624 --> 02:45:58.368
I was not in a policy-making
position at Los Alamos.

02:45:58.392 --> 02:46:00.038
I would have done anything
I was asked to do.

02:46:00.062 --> 02:46:02.330
Well, then you would have
built the H-bomb too,

02:46:02.363 --> 02:46:03.498
- wouldn't you?
- I couldn't.

02:46:03.531 --> 02:46:05.433
I didn't ask you that, Doctor!

02:46:05.466 --> 02:46:07.802
And the GAC report
which you co-authored

02:46:07.836 --> 02:46:09.704
after the Soviet
atomic test said

02:46:09.737 --> 02:46:12.406
a Super bomb should
never be built!

02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:13.775
What we meant,
what I meant was...

02:46:13.808 --> 02:46:15.878
- What you, who? Who?
- What I meant...

02:46:17.645 --> 02:46:19.085
And wouldn't the
Russians do anything

02:46:19.114 --> 02:46:21.382
to increase their strength?

02:46:21.415 --> 02:46:23.393
If we did
it, they would have to do it.

02:46:23.417 --> 02:46:25.453
Our efforts would only
fuel their efforts,

02:46:25.486 --> 02:46:27.588
just as it had with
the atomic bomb.

02:46:27.622 --> 02:46:31.026
"Just as it had with the
atomic bomb," exactly!

02:46:31.059 --> 02:46:35.797
No moral scruples in
1945, plenty in 1949.

02:46:39.935 --> 02:46:41.769
Dr. Oppenheimer...

02:46:43.437 --> 02:46:46.041
when did your strong
moral convictions develop

02:46:46.074 --> 02:46:48.877
with respect to
the hydrogen bomb?

02:46:55.918 --> 02:46:58.821
When it became clear to me

02:46:58.854 --> 02:47:02.490
that we would tend to
use any weapon we had.

02:47:04.927 --> 02:47:07.428
<i>J. Robert
Oppenheimer, the martyr.</i>

02:47:07.461 --> 02:47:10.065
I gave him exactly
what he wanted.

02:47:10.098 --> 02:47:12.366
To be remembered for Trinity,

02:47:12.400 --> 02:47:15.003
not Hiroshima,

02:47:15.037 --> 02:47:17.471
not Nagasaki.

02:47:20.008 --> 02:47:22.710
He should be thanking me.

02:47:22.743 --> 02:47:25.680
Well, he's not.

02:47:27.515 --> 02:47:29.117
Do we still have enough votes,

02:47:29.151 --> 02:47:30.819
or is the crowning
moment of my career

02:47:30.853 --> 02:47:34.990
about to become the most
public humiliation of my life?

02:47:35.023 --> 02:47:37.592
Full Senate's about to vote.

02:47:37.625 --> 02:47:38.793
You'll scrape through.

02:47:38.827 --> 02:47:40.461
Great, then gather
the fucking press.

02:47:40.494 --> 02:47:42.463
Dr. J.
Robert Oppenheimer.

02:47:42.496 --> 02:47:45.466
This board, having
heard testimony from you

02:47:45.499 --> 02:47:48.636
and many of your current
and former colleagues,

02:47:48.669 --> 02:47:50.671
has come to the
unanimous conclusion

02:47:50.705 --> 02:47:53.808
that you are a loyal citizen.

02:47:55.110 --> 02:47:56.744
However,

02:47:56.777 --> 02:48:00.414
in the light of your
continuing associations

02:48:00.448 --> 02:48:01.716
and disregard

02:48:01.749 --> 02:48:03.886
for the security
apparatus of this country,

02:48:03.919 --> 02:48:07.455
together with your
somewhat disturbing conduct

02:48:07.488 --> 02:48:10.025
on the hydrogen bomb program

02:48:10.058 --> 02:48:11.592
and the regrettable
lack of candor

02:48:11.626 --> 02:48:13.996
in certain of your
responses to this board,

02:48:14.029 --> 02:48:16.899
we have voted two to one

02:48:16.932 --> 02:48:20.035
to deny the renewal of
your security clearance.

02:48:20.068 --> 02:48:23.171
A full written opinion, with
a dissent from Mr. Evans,

02:48:23.205 --> 02:48:26.707
will be issued to the
AEC in the coming days.

02:48:26.741 --> 02:48:28.409
That is all.

02:48:32.180 --> 02:48:33.514
- Gordon...
- Roger.

02:48:38.552 --> 02:48:40.454
<i>Robert.</i>

02:48:41.089 --> 02:48:42.623
Robert.

02:48:45.093 --> 02:48:46.594
Don't...

02:48:48.964 --> 02:48:52.167
Don't take in the sheets.

02:48:53.567 --> 02:48:54.970
Get a
picture with him.

02:48:55.003 --> 02:48:56.238
Sir, sir.

02:48:56.271 --> 02:48:58.739
Two
minutes. Two minutes.

02:48:58.773 --> 02:48:59.984
- You'll get your shot.
- Please, sir.

02:49:00.008 --> 02:49:01.575
We've been waiting for so long.

02:49:01.609 --> 02:49:02.619
- Evening, sir.
- Come out.

02:49:02.643 --> 02:49:03.678
Sir, sir!

02:49:03.711 --> 02:49:05.047
Is it official?

02:49:07.149 --> 02:49:08.549
Well, there were,

02:49:08.582 --> 02:49:11.719
uh, a couple of
unexpected holdouts.

02:49:16.158 --> 02:49:18.827
I'm denied. Yeah?

02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:20.829
- I'm afraid so, sir.
- All right.

02:49:28.536 --> 02:49:29.603
Who were the holdouts?

02:49:29.637 --> 02:49:32.573
Um, there were three,

02:49:32.606 --> 02:49:35.543
led by the junior senator
from Massachusetts.

02:49:35.576 --> 02:49:36.988
Young guy trying to
make a name for himself,

02:49:37.012 --> 02:49:39.580
didn't like what you
did to Oppenheimer.

02:49:39.613 --> 02:49:40.748
What's his name?

02:49:40.781 --> 02:49:42.985
Uh, Kennedy.

02:49:43.018 --> 02:49:44.820
John F. Kennedy.

02:49:48.290 --> 02:49:49.690
Kitty?

02:49:55.763 --> 02:49:59.167
Did you think that if you
let them tar and feather you,

02:49:59.201 --> 02:50:01.769
that the world
would forgive you?

02:50:05.307 --> 02:50:06.741
It won't.

02:50:09.111 --> 02:50:10.511
We'll see.

02:50:20.288 --> 02:50:22.290
Goddamn it.

02:50:23.825 --> 02:50:26.761
You
told me I'd be okay.

02:50:26.794 --> 02:50:29.164
Yeah, well, I didn't have
all the facts, did I?

02:50:29.197 --> 02:50:30.765
Here's a fact.

02:50:30.798 --> 02:50:32.642
President Eisenhower
pinned the Medal of Freedom

02:50:32.666 --> 02:50:34.102
on my chest last year

02:50:34.136 --> 02:50:36.637
'cause I've always done
what's right for this country.

02:50:36.670 --> 02:50:39.174
They don't want me
in the Cabinet room?

02:50:39.207 --> 02:50:41.642
Well, that's... that's fine.

02:50:41.675 --> 02:50:44.012
Maybe they should just
invite Oppenheimer instead.

02:50:44.046 --> 02:50:45.080
Maybe they will.

02:50:46.081 --> 02:50:47.315
I told you,

02:50:47.349 --> 02:50:49.985
he turned the scientists
against me one by one,

02:50:50.018 --> 02:50:52.187
starting with Einstein. I
told you about, uh, Einstein.

02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:53.654
I saw him by the pond.

02:50:53.687 --> 02:50:55.190
You did, but you know, sir,

02:50:55.223 --> 02:50:57.225
since nobody really knows

02:50:57.259 --> 02:50:58.894
what they said to
each other that day,

02:50:58.927 --> 02:51:02.964
is it possible they didn't
talk about you at all?

02:51:02.998 --> 02:51:06.134
Is it possible they spoke
about something, uh,

02:51:06.168 --> 02:51:07.601
more important?

02:51:07.635 --> 02:51:09.071
Mr. Strauss!

02:51:12.407 --> 02:51:14.809
Over here! Mr. Strauss!

02:51:17.946 --> 02:51:21.216
Oh.

02:51:22.384 --> 02:51:23.684
Thank you.

02:51:23.717 --> 02:51:26.221
Albert.

02:51:26.254 --> 02:51:28.223
Ah.

02:51:28.256 --> 02:51:30.758
The man of the moment.

02:51:33.862 --> 02:51:37.232
You once held a-a
reception for me.

02:51:37.265 --> 02:51:39.067
In Berkeley. You
gave me an award.

02:51:39.101 --> 02:51:40.969
- Hmm?
- Yes.

02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:44.272
You all thought that
I had lost the ability

02:51:44.306 --> 02:51:47.242
to understand what I'd started.

02:51:47.275 --> 02:51:50.711
So the award really
wasn't for me,

02:51:50.744 --> 02:51:53.148
it was for all of you, hmm?

02:51:55.016 --> 02:51:57.018
Now it's your turn

02:51:57.052 --> 02:52:01.755
to deal with the consequences
of your achievement.

02:52:02.690 --> 02:52:03.992
And one day,

02:52:04.025 --> 02:52:06.660
when they've punished
you enough...

02:52:08.063 --> 02:52:11.967
they'll serve you
salmon and potato salad.

02:52:15.703 --> 02:52:17.738
Make speeches...

02:52:18.772 --> 02:52:20.275
<i>give you a medal.</i>

02:52:21.977 --> 02:52:24.146
Hello, Frank.

02:52:24.179 --> 02:52:25.413
You're happy, I'm happy.

02:52:32.387 --> 02:52:35.723
<i>Pat you on the back,
tell you all is forgiven.</i>

02:52:37.259 --> 02:52:39.660
<i>Just remember...</i>

02:52:40.295 --> 02:52:42.164
<i>it won't be for you.</i>

02:52:46.434 --> 02:52:48.069
<i>It'll be for them.</i>

02:53:02.217 --> 02:53:03.751
Albert.

02:53:04.986 --> 02:53:08.456
When I came to you with
those calculations,

02:53:08.490 --> 02:53:10.724
we thought we might
start a chain reaction

02:53:10.758 --> 02:53:14.229
that would destroy
the entire world.

02:53:14.262 --> 02:53:17.731
Mm, I remember it well.

02:53:17.765 --> 02:53:19.834
What of it?

02:53:22.470 --> 02:53:24.206
I believe we did.
