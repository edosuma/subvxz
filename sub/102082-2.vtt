# Oh, when I need her... #

11:42.220 --> 11:45.700
Oh, my God, they look real.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.900
Yes, very convincing.

11:47.900 --> 11:49.860
Bring up the CT scan of his skull.

11:52.020 --> 11:54.940
See those screws in his upper jaw?

11:54.940 --> 11:56.660
GRACE: Mm, dental implants.

11:56.660 --> 11:56.900
His original canines
GRACE: Mm, dental implants.

11:56.900 --> 11:58.620
His original canines
have been removed

11:58.620 --> 11:58.860
His original canines
and replaced with vampire fangs.

11:58.860 --> 11:59.980
and replaced with vampire fangs.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.700
That's dedication to the role.

12:02.660 --> 12:04.180
Check that out.

12:04.180 --> 12:06.220
Looks like some kind of burn.

12:06.220 --> 12:08.660
Sunburn? Makes sense.

12:08.660 --> 12:10.180
Vampires hate the sun.

12:10.180 --> 12:13.740
Mythologically speaking,
a vampire would turn to dust

12:13.740 --> 12:15.060
if exposed to sunlight,

12:15.060 --> 12:16.940
so we can rule that theory out.

12:16.940 --> 12:18.860
Shall we move on?

12:19.820 --> 12:21.620
Healthy musculature.

12:21.620 --> 12:25.100
Skin pallor consistent with
significant blood loss.

12:25.100 --> 12:25.340
Skin pallor consistent with
One large incision into the chest,

12:25.340 --> 12:28.900
One large incision into the chest,

12:28.900 --> 12:31.820
20 centimetres in length,

12:31.820 --> 12:34.540
slightly left of the sternum.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.020
This is interesting.

12:37.020 --> 12:40.700
Multiple scars in
the cubital fossa of his left arm.

12:40.700 --> 12:40.940
Multiple scars in
Needle penetrations.

12:40.940 --> 12:42.180
Needle penetrations.

12:42.180 --> 12:42.420
They're on his right arm, too.
Needle penetrations.

12:42.420 --> 12:44.420
They're on his right arm, too.
Possible drug use?

12:44.420 --> 12:44.660
They're on his right arm, too.
Maybe.

12:44.660 --> 12:45.940
Maybe.

12:45.940 --> 12:48.620
We'll order a full tox
when we take bloods.

12:48.620 --> 12:51.140
EDWINA: What's this tattoo
on his left calf?

12:52.220 --> 12:53.700
'Ae...ternum'.

12:53.700 --> 12:56.620
It's Latin for 'eternal life'.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.900
So, this guy really thought
he was a vampire?

12:58.900 --> 13:01.140
That he'd live forever?
Oh, perhaps.

13:01.140 --> 13:04.860
Or perhaps he was
a devoted lifestyle vampire.

13:07.100 --> 13:09.020
They're part of the Goth subculture.

13:09.020 --> 13:11.580
People who identify as vampires.

13:11.580 --> 13:11.820
They...dress like them,
People who identify as vampires.

13:11.820 --> 13:14.540
They...dress like them,
live like them,

13:14.540 --> 13:17.380
take part in vampirical rituals,
even drink blood.

13:17.380 --> 13:20.780
But they do not turn into bats
or have supernatural powers.

13:20.780 --> 13:21.020
But they do not turn into bats
That is pure folklore.

13:21.020 --> 13:22.620
That is pure folklore.

13:22.620 --> 13:22.860

That is pure folklore.

Oh...

13:25.860 --> 13:28.060
Oh, my colour consultant's here.

13:28.060 --> 13:29.420
Carry on.

13:32.220 --> 13:34.420
Peace at last.

13:34.420 --> 13:38.180
Right. Take bloods and urine
and we'll open him up.

13:42.620 --> 13:43.980
No heart?

13:43.980 --> 13:45.540
It's been cut out.

13:45.540 --> 13:47.620
Look at the damage to the ribs,

13:47.620 --> 13:50.100
directly over
where the heart would be.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.540
Looks like a penetration wound.

13:51.540 --> 13:51.780
But it's not consistent
Looks like a penetration wound.

13:51.780 --> 13:54.460
But it's not consistent
with a narrow blade.

13:54.460 --> 13:54.700
But it's not consistent
A stake through the heart, maybe.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.420
A stake through the heart, maybe.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.860
Maybe.

13:57.860 --> 14:00.100
But without the heart, we can't know.

14:00.100 --> 14:00.340
These cuts are very neat.
But without the heart, we can't know.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.220
These cuts are very neat.
Yes.

14:02.220 --> 14:05.980
Whoever did this has worked
with bones and tissues before.

14:05.980 --> 14:08.940
Let's remove the stomach
and see what he's been eating.

14:10.380 --> 14:11.940
Oh, blood?

14:11.940 --> 14:14.100
He wasn't bleeding internally,
was he?

14:14.100 --> 14:14.340
He wasn't bleeding internally,
No. He'd been drinking it.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.780
No. He'd been drinking it.

14:16.780 --> 14:18.500
Is it human?

14:18.500 --> 14:18.740
Scientific haven't sent through
Is it human?

14:18.740 --> 14:21.220
Scientific haven't sent through
their results yet,

14:21.220 --> 14:21.460
Scientific haven't sent through
but we don't have to wait.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.020
but we don't have to wait.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.340
Here.

14:24.340 --> 14:26.260
Put one end into the blood.

14:26.260 --> 14:28.940
If it contains human haemoglobin,

14:28.940 --> 14:30.660
the markers will show up positive.

14:31.900 --> 14:37.140
If he had been consuming human blood
on a regular basis,

14:37.140 --> 14:40.980
then his liver
should be quite badly damaged.

14:40.980 --> 14:44.460
Yes, because the liver can't
break down the iron in human blood.

14:46.620 --> 14:48.140
And here's the proof?

14:48.140 --> 14:50.300
Severe liver cirrhosis.

14:50.300 --> 14:50.540
Uh...you may want to
Severe liver cirrhosis.

14:50.540 --> 14:53.260
Uh...you may want to
rethink that theory.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.620
The markers are negative.
It's not human blood.

14:57.620 --> 14:57.860
The markers are negative.
Let me have a look at that.

14:57.860 --> 14:59.100
Let me have a look at that.

Yeah, absolutely.

15:26.260 --> 15:27.940
I don't get it.

15:27.940 --> 15:29.780
If he hasn't been consuming
human blood,

15:29.780 --> 15:32.300
then why is his liver
so badly damaged?

15:48.900 --> 15:50.780
Pass me the urine sample.

15:52.060 --> 15:54.780
Dr Harrow? Where are you going?

15:54.780 --> 15:56.860
Wait for me.

There is only one blood disease

15:59.140 --> 16:01.380
that causes acute sensitivity
to sunlight

16:01.380 --> 16:02.780
as well as chronic liver damage.

16:02.780 --> 16:04.180
What disease?

16:05.460 --> 16:06.820
Dr Haz?

16:07.980 --> 16:11.100
Erythropoietic protoporphyria.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.380
Proto-what?
Porphyria.

16:14.380 --> 16:16.700
It's an extremely rare blood disorder

16:16.700 --> 16:20.620
where the sufferer's skin becomes
incredibly sensitive to UV light.

16:20.620 --> 16:23.700
If exposed, their blood
starts to boil,

16:23.700 --> 16:27.140
attacks the nerve endings
in the skin, rips them apart,

16:27.140 --> 16:29.140
giving the appearance of sunburn.

16:29.140 --> 16:32.060
Now, sufferers have to spend
their entire lives indoors

16:32.060 --> 16:34.580
and require frequent
blood transfusions

16:34.580 --> 16:36.340
to remove the porphyria toxins.

16:36.340 --> 16:39.260
That explains the needle marks
in his arm.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.500
In less informed times,
the only treatment

16:41.500 --> 16:44.020
was to drink animal blood
and avoid daylight.

16:44.020 --> 16:46.780
But sufferers were often persecuted,
even killed,

16:46.780 --> 16:49.180
because people believed
they drank human blood, too,

16:49.180 --> 16:50.660
fuelling vampire folklore.

16:50.660 --> 16:52.740

happened to Sebastian?

16:52.740 --> 16:55.380

16:57.500 --> 17:00.660
Look, ask the lab to confirm
porphyria and check with CIB.

a missing heart.

He was just a toddler when I first
realised something was wrong.

18:55.420 --> 18:57.180
I took him to the pool

18:57.180 --> 18:57.420
and for no reason,
I took him to the pool

18:57.420 --> 18:59.700

he just started screaming.

18:59.700 --> 18:59.940
and for no reason,
He wouldn't stop.

18:59.940 --> 19:01.420
He wouldn't stop.

19:01.420 --> 19:05.980
When we got home, I saw his arms
and legs were covered in blisters.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.380
But it wasn't sunburn.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.260
Porphyria.

19:11.220 --> 19:13.420
Everything changed after that.

19:14.940 --> 19:17.180
He couldn't go outside
during the day.

19:19.140 --> 19:21.580
Can you imagine what that's like
as a child?

19:22.780 --> 19:24.980
Living your entire life in the dark?

No picnics in the park.

No trips to the beach.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.420

19:51.900 --> 19:53.740
And drinking animal blood?

19:54.700 --> 19:57.700
He said it gave him some relief,
so I encouraged it.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.020
I know how that sounds.

19:59.020 --> 20:00.820
Oh, no, no, I understand.

20:00.820 --> 20:03.860
The extra haemoglobin
would have eased his symptoms.

20:06.220 --> 20:08.700
We used to call him
'My little vampire'.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.740
I even found a children's book
in the library.

20:13.740 --> 20:16.820
The Lonely Vampire.
I saw it in his collection.

20:17.980 --> 20:19.740
He loved that book.

20:21.740 --> 20:25.100
So you knew about the teeth
and...sleeping in the coffin?

20:25.100 --> 20:25.340
So you knew about the teeth
Yes.

20:25.340 --> 20:26.500
Yes.

20:28.180 --> 20:30.700
I'd be lying if I said
I understood. I didn't.

20:31.860 --> 20:33.580
But it seemed to make him happy.

20:34.580 --> 20:38.660
He had a house, a job and...
and, for the first time in his life,

He'd had a...pretty rough childhood.

21:39.740 --> 21:41.380
You knew about his condition?

21:41.380 --> 21:43.660
We thought it was kinda cool.

21:43.660 --> 21:46.420
Like he was the real deal, you know?

21:46.420 --> 21:48.140
A real-life vampire.

21:49.180 --> 21:52.220
And he loved the fact
that we were OK with it.

21:52.220 --> 21:55.780
Was there ever any trouble -
with the neighbours, other residents?

21:55.780 --> 21:56.020
Was there ever any trouble -
All the time.

21:56.020 --> 21:57.580
All the time.

21:58.620 --> 22:00.660
There was heaps of people
in the suburb

22:00.660 --> 22:03.900
who thought that Baz was...a weirdo.

22:03.900 --> 22:07.580
And he was always getting anonymous
letters, telling him to move out.

22:07.580 --> 22:07.820
And he was always getting anonymous
Do you have any idea who sent them?

22:07.820 --> 22:09.740

No.

22:12.300 --> 22:13.860
But Baz didn't care.

22:13.860 --> 22:17.180
He loved that everyone thought
he was a real vampire.

22:17.180 --> 22:20.260
And the blood drinking,
that really played into it.

22:21.220 --> 22:22.740
Do either of you drink blood?

22:24.260 --> 22:27.420
No, I'm...I'm more of a lager man.

22:30.180 --> 22:32.180
Where did he get the blood from?

22:35.020 --> 22:37.500

22:39.700 --> 22:42.340
And where can we find her?

33:00.780 --> 33:02.580
He doesn't like me.

33:03.740 --> 33:05.300
Or Cannoli.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.100

go to the church.

the Reverend doesn't like him?

Oh, he's on his way to CIB now.

You know I can't believe that he lied
about not knowing the victim.

Mrs Kovacs had been bitten
by a snake at her home

37:33.940 --> 37:36.260
and her husband
called the family physician,

37:36.260 --> 37:40.100
who was unable to find a pulse,
so declared her dead at the scene.

37:40.100 --> 37:43.300
But her pulse was suppressed
by snake venom,

37:43.300 --> 37:43.540
But her pulse was suppressed
which wasn't sufficient to kill her

37:43.540 --> 37:45.260

into a death-like coma.

But whatever it is,
he didn't find it

because everything in that car was
transferred to the evidence lock-up

46:28.180 --> 46:29.380
two days ago.

46:29.380 --> 46:29.620
Did he break into
two days ago.

46:29.620 --> 46:30.740
Did he break into
any other vehicles?

46:30.740 --> 46:30.980
Did he break into
No, only this one.

46:30.980 --> 46:32.740
No, only this one.

46:32.740 --> 46:35.540
Which makes me think there was more
than one person at the shipyard

46:35.540 --> 46:35.780
Which makes me think there was more
when our victim fell to his death.

46:35.780 --> 46:37.940
when our victim fell to his death.

46:37.940 --> 46:39.740
We need to find this guy.

46:41.140 --> 46:44.220
You think he might have
some information on our victim?

46:44.220 --> 46:46.860
I think he might be involved
in his death.

47:05.020 --> 47:07.220
(DOOR CREAKS AND CLOSES)

47:37.940 --> 47:39.620
Hi, Dad.

47:42.780 --> 47:44.540
Next, on Harrow...

47:44.540 --> 47:47.100
JAMES: I've never asked you for
anything, but I'm asking you now.

47:47.100 --> 47:49.620
You should just go to the police.
I can't.

47:49.620 --> 47:51.660
NICHOLS: The dead young man
is her son.

47:51.660 --> 47:53.220
This will not be going away.

47:53.220 --> 47:55.780
And what's this about...trouble?

47:56.740 --> 47:59.340
If he's done nothing wrong,
I can help him.

48:00.300 --> 48:01.900
HARROW: It's not
a pleasant way to go.

48:01.900 --> 48:02.140
HARROW: It's not
There is no way Mum drowned herself.

48:02.140 --> 48:04.100
There is no way Mum drowned herself.

48:04.100 --> 48:07.100
NICHOLS: She's left everything
to your son, Nate.

48:07.100 --> 48:08.940
Is there anything
you want to tell us?

48:08.940 --> 48:10.260
Forget it.
