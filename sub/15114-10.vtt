WEBVTT

00:01.416 --> 00:03.383
We ran the system
for our missing sniper.

00:03.490 --> 00:05.288
Boetker has no priors anywhere.

00:05.401 --> 00:07.918
Your suspicions about Ezra
Stone are not unfounded.

00:08.023 --> 00:09.623
- You'll go on record?
- For 10,000 bucks.

00:09.754 --> 00:11.485
This is dangerous what we're doing.
We've got to slow down.

00:11.610 --> 00:12.852
What's this,
some kind of joke, man?

00:12.957 --> 00:14.365
Trey trying to punk
me out with this sh--

00:14.578 --> 00:16.659
Tina? Sweetheart!

00:16.761 --> 00:18.634
I-- I need medical help!

00:18.760 --> 00:20.686
My husband's trust
isn't easily earned.

00:20.796 --> 00:23.735
Allow me to contribute
to Tom Kane's PAC.

00:23.830 --> 00:25.231
Now is not the time
to think small.

00:25.342 --> 00:29.390
I present to you the Gardens
Convention Center and Casino.

00:29.519 --> 00:31.569
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're back in business.

00:31.674 --> 00:34.626
There was no political upside
to the promises you made,

00:34.756 --> 00:38.401
so either you give a shit or
you're a motherfucking lunatic!

00:38.523 --> 00:40.198
Give my best to Bitsy.

00:40.367 --> 00:41.552
- Miss?
- What is this about?

00:41.656 --> 00:42.499
Get in!

01:44.780 --> 01:46.786
I, Meredith Kane,
solemnly swear

01:46.975 --> 01:49.603
that I will support the
Constitution of the United States

01:49.751 --> 01:51.023
and the State of Illinois

01:51.197 --> 01:52.815
and that I will
faithfully discharge

01:52.934 --> 01:54.820
the duties of the office
of Alderman

01:54.939 --> 01:58.358
of the City of Chicago
to the best of my abilities.

01:59.418 --> 02:00.978
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the new alderman

02:01.088 --> 02:02.542
for the 11th Ward.

02:13.053 --> 02:15.073
Welcome to the council,
Mrs. Kane.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.684
- Congratulations.
- A pleasure to serve with you.

02:16.850 --> 02:18.879
- Looking forward to working
with you, Mrs. Kane. - So do I.

02:19.197 --> 02:21.291
Group picture?
Okay.

02:23.147 --> 02:24.484
How about that?

02:24.676 --> 02:26.292
Two Kanes for the price of one.

02:28.724 --> 02:31.004
Kenya Taylor murdered,
no suspects.

02:31.195 --> 02:32.573
Smacks of City Hall.

02:32.692 --> 02:34.295
As much as you'd like to
think Kane is responsible

02:34.410 --> 02:35.747
for every horrible thing
that happens,

02:35.855 --> 02:37.754
you've officially got a whole
lot of nothing on him.

02:37.856 --> 02:39.281
I didn't say Kane,
I said City Hall.

02:39.390 --> 02:42.373
And I've got very damaging
information from unnamed sources.

02:42.482 --> 02:43.352
Sir, Mr. Baine
called.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.387
- He wants to have lunch
with you today. - Thank you.

02:45.525 --> 02:47.285
- Hope you brought a suit.
- Suits?

02:47.468 --> 02:49.084
I don't need no stinking suits.

02:49.268 --> 02:50.954
This is good.
It's really good.

02:51.728 --> 02:53.113
Thanks.

02:53.602 --> 02:55.651
This morning Senator Walsh
suspended her campaign

02:55.762 --> 02:58.000
in the wake of what is
a very personal tragedy.

02:58.298 --> 03:00.828
I'd like to extend my condolences
to Catherine for her loss.

03:00.999 --> 03:01.980
My thoughts and prayers

03:02.082 --> 03:04.596
are with her and with
Miss Patterson's family.

03:04.911 --> 03:07.244
- <i>Given what I understand...</i>
<i>- It's Daddy on the radio!</i>

03:07.347 --> 03:08.598
<i>...is an ongoing</i>
<i>homicide investigation,</i>

03:08.727 --> 03:09.954
- <i>I support her decision to withdraw.</i>
- It's Daddy talking.

03:10.078 --> 03:12.767
<i>I, however, remain committed
to my candidacy for governor.</i>

03:13.097 --> 03:13.885
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:14.012 --> 03:15.799
<i>That was State
Treasurer Zajack speaking...</i>

03:20.782 --> 03:23.442
- Hi. Is he in?
- Miss O'Neil.

03:23.543 --> 03:25.492
The mayor is not available,
nor is he expecting you.

03:25.649 --> 03:27.751
I just need a moment of his time.
Given the situation--

03:27.862 --> 03:29.823
I'm afraid that's not possible.

03:31.215 --> 03:32.827
You have my sympathy.

03:32.861 --> 03:35.897
It must be a difficult time
for your organization.

03:35.931 --> 03:37.732
May I speak with you privately?

03:51.680 --> 03:55.083
<i>I wanted out of the Walsh camp</i>
<i>even before all this happened.</i>

03:55.117 --> 03:58.186
- Did you?
- Springfield isn't Chicago.

03:58.220 --> 03:59.687
This here,

03:59.722 --> 04:01.723
you--

04:03.593 --> 04:05.094
I want to be
a part of it again.

04:06.362 --> 04:08.030
I heard that
Mona Fredricks quit,

04:08.065 --> 04:09.600
so I guess officially
I'm asking--

04:09.634 --> 04:11.768
She was fired like you.

04:14.338 --> 04:17.374
I regret the mistakes I made.

04:17.408 --> 04:18.875
I lost my way.

04:26.785 --> 04:29.253
But I'd--
I'd like to think

04:29.288 --> 04:31.088
<i>that my eight years of service</i>

04:31.123 --> 04:33.758
were nothing less than stellar.

04:40.032 --> 04:41.600
It's good to see you, Kitty.

04:57.618 --> 05:00.887
- I can't pull this off.
<i>- Why? What did he say?</i>

05:00.921 --> 05:03.523
- Nothing.
- But he didn't say no.

05:03.558 --> 05:05.725
I just-- I don't want to do this, okay?

05:05.760 --> 05:07.260
Want is not on the table.

05:07.294 --> 05:09.996
I have more than two decades
of subpoenaed material,

05:10.030 --> 05:12.699
so I will find dirt
on his hands and yours.

05:12.733 --> 05:15.869
So cooperator
or codefendant--

05:15.903 --> 05:17.904
the choice is yours.

05:20.741 --> 05:23.543
Looks like Boetker and Langley
were on the same page.

05:24.645 --> 05:27.681
Neither a fan
of the mayor, it seems.

05:29.183 --> 05:33.053
Single gunshot wound,
appears self-inflicted.

05:34.456 --> 05:38.659
So, it's a couple of nut jobs
with a master plan.

05:38.693 --> 05:41.495
- Is that the story here?
<i>- His buddy gets caught,</i>

05:41.530 --> 05:43.264
figures it's only a matter
of time before he does.

05:43.298 --> 05:45.432
Well, why not just
go back under?

05:45.467 --> 05:47.534
Like he was before?
Why shoot himself?

05:47.568 --> 05:49.236
Catholic guilt?

05:52.908 --> 05:55.509
Let's get our ducks
in a row first.

05:55.543 --> 05:57.344
Keep a lid on this.

05:57.378 --> 05:59.380
There's too many cops
with big mouths.

06:11.993 --> 06:14.161
The state's attorney called.

06:14.195 --> 06:16.097
They found the man
that shot Mrs. Kane.

06:17.532 --> 06:20.067
<i>He's dead.</i>
<i>Suicide.</i>

06:20.101 --> 06:21.735
<i>Apparently he and Langley</i>
<i>knew each other.</i>

06:21.770 --> 06:23.971
They were both insane
racists or something.

06:24.005 --> 06:25.472
It's good news.

06:25.507 --> 06:28.442
Yes, a relief.

06:32.014 --> 06:33.914
I suggest a joint
press conference.

06:39.354 --> 06:43.391
By the way, I know we haven't
discussed this, but...

06:43.425 --> 06:45.860
I was assuming that
with Mona's departure, I--

06:45.894 --> 06:47.895
Never assume anything.

06:50.967 --> 06:52.868
He called her Bitsy!

06:52.902 --> 06:54.636
How would he know that, Sean?

06:54.671 --> 06:56.672
How would he know
our daughter's nickname?

06:56.706 --> 06:59.107
Maybe you mentioned it once
when you were in the office--

06:59.142 --> 07:00.843
- Trust me, I didn't.
- Okay, baby, look,

07:00.877 --> 07:02.611
I know you're feeling
like that he's got--

07:02.646 --> 07:04.647
<i>That hole wasn't there before.</i>

07:04.681 --> 07:06.816
That could have been from when
we hung streamers that time.

07:06.850 --> 07:09.586
No, it wasn't.

07:09.751 --> 07:12.099
What are you doing?
You're acting crazy!

07:19.263 --> 07:21.998
<i>What's wrong?</i>

07:23.067 --> 07:25.034
He watched.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.445
Sam, have a seat.

07:35.479 --> 07:37.013
The mayor happened
to be lunching nearby.

07:37.047 --> 07:38.615
I asked him to join us.

07:38.649 --> 07:41.384
Enjoying your position
at the "Sentinel," Mr. Miller?

07:41.419 --> 07:43.553
I've got it.
Thank you.

07:45.556 --> 07:49.092
Yeah.
I love it there.

07:49.127 --> 07:52.028
- Sam's taken to his position with real
gusto. - Certainly made your mark.

07:52.063 --> 07:54.264
You've taken quite a different
tone than your predecessor.

07:54.298 --> 07:57.100
He's a good man-- Bentley.
You ever hear from him?

07:57.134 --> 07:59.335
Occasional e-mail.
We keep in touch.

08:01.004 --> 08:05.375
So... you mind if I ask
what we're doing here?

08:05.409 --> 08:07.410
What do you mean?
We're having lunch.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.380
Peter, you
try the lobster here?

08:10.415 --> 08:12.316
Exactly what I had in mind.

08:12.350 --> 08:14.118
Would you be so kind
to order for me, Tom?

08:14.152 --> 08:16.320
I've got to run
to the restroom.

08:22.027 --> 08:23.761
I get it, you're pals.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.263
Freedom of the press--

08:25.297 --> 08:27.665
I believe it was
Liebling who said

08:27.699 --> 08:30.868
it can only be guaranteed
by those who actually own one.

08:30.902 --> 08:33.938
And he meant that owners of the
press had the right to publish

08:33.972 --> 08:35.539
without government
interference.

08:42.648 --> 08:44.449
Stop.

08:52.157 --> 08:55.459
Give my apologies
to Mr. Baine.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.929
I don't have time for lunch.

09:01.533 --> 09:03.667
I'm on deadline.

09:07.873 --> 09:09.707
You have connections,

09:09.742 --> 09:11.409
I'll give you that.

09:12.511 --> 09:13.978
What are you saying?

09:14.012 --> 09:15.780
Getting off on a misdemeanor.

09:15.814 --> 09:18.048
Then again, you are
the mayor's daughter.

09:18.083 --> 09:20.384
I didn't do anything
that wrong.

09:20.418 --> 09:22.586
<i>Conspiracy to distribute,</i>

09:22.620 --> 09:25.255
pissing hot on your drug test.

09:25.289 --> 09:27.057
'Course, your boyfriend
took care of that one.

09:27.091 --> 09:29.425
What, you mean Ian?

09:29.460 --> 09:32.395
Who?
No, the black guy.

09:50.813 --> 09:52.815
That was good shit.

09:57.921 --> 10:00.723
How much I owe you?

10:00.757 --> 10:03.859
Nah, nothing.
Forget it.

10:06.630 --> 10:08.898
Yo, what's--
what's it feel like?

10:08.932 --> 10:11.167
You ain't never tried it?

10:13.337 --> 10:15.939
Never wanted to.

10:15.973 --> 10:18.541
It makes things go away.

10:23.313 --> 10:25.347
Want a taste?

10:33.490 --> 10:35.357
Yeah. Why not?

11:36.218 --> 11:39.086
I mean, there's an obvious need to
consolidate the western counties that--

11:39.121 --> 11:41.723
This office would seem
like an unnecessary expense.

11:41.757 --> 11:43.591
Don't know why you need
to keep it open, Governor.

11:43.625 --> 11:45.693
Presumptive.

11:46.928 --> 11:48.930
Don't let me keep you.

11:56.204 --> 11:57.905
I still need to be
elected by the people.

11:57.939 --> 11:59.674
You will be.
Easily, I'm sure.

11:59.708 --> 12:02.243
Next highest vote getter below
Walsh is in the single digits.

12:02.277 --> 12:04.211
Yeah.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.846
So, uh, what can I do for you?

12:05.880 --> 12:07.414
I'd like you to take a
trip down to Springfield.

12:07.448 --> 12:09.216
Mac can bring you up to speed
on what needs to be done

12:09.250 --> 12:11.084
on the city's casino plan.

12:11.119 --> 12:12.886
I'd appreciate it
if the presumptive governor

12:12.920 --> 12:16.156
is a bit more agreeable than the
state treasurer was recently.

12:18.759 --> 12:20.660
I need to campaign
down there anyway.

12:20.695 --> 12:23.129
Good.
Glad to hear it.

12:23.164 --> 12:24.631
Nice place you got here.

12:24.665 --> 12:26.633
Still don't think
you need it, though.

12:35.176 --> 12:37.110
Surprised to hear from you.

12:37.145 --> 12:39.179
I thought you'd be above
this sort of thing.

12:39.213 --> 12:41.181
I need a named source.
I got tired of waiting.

12:44.552 --> 12:46.019
It's all there--

12:46.054 --> 12:47.521
10K of my own
hard-earned cash.

12:47.555 --> 12:48.989
Do me a favor--
count it later.

12:49.023 --> 12:50.858
This whole thing creeps me out.

12:56.465 --> 12:58.099
- What are you doing?
- Wire check.

12:58.133 --> 13:00.935
Only value I got is what
comes out of my mouth.

13:00.970 --> 13:03.805
Once I'm on tape,
I'm not worth shit to you.

13:03.839 --> 13:05.907
So what are you saying?
You're gonna squeeze me for more later?

13:07.276 --> 13:09.444
Whatever.
What the fuck?

13:09.478 --> 13:11.112
What'd you find at Stone's
when you got there?

13:11.147 --> 13:13.716
Him dead in a chair,
suitcase on the bed.

13:13.750 --> 13:16.852
- No ransacking?
- No, we did that.

13:16.887 --> 13:18.521
We broke a window
in the back, too.

13:18.555 --> 13:20.657
Any idea who killed him?

13:20.691 --> 13:23.558
No. I'm smart enough
to not care.

13:23.593 --> 13:25.360
Well, who told you
to stage the scene?

13:25.394 --> 13:26.895
That's gonna be
tricky to prove.

13:26.929 --> 13:28.430
Now, the lieutenant
who was there at the time--

13:28.464 --> 13:31.133
because supposedly
it's such a high-profile case--

13:31.167 --> 13:34.035
he says, "Looks like
a burglary to me."

13:34.070 --> 13:36.104
So you made sure that it did.

13:41.444 --> 13:44.947
I can't understand
this kind of hatred.

13:44.982 --> 13:48.117
One was a schizophrenic,
the other...

13:48.151 --> 13:50.219
who knows?

13:50.253 --> 13:53.555
Thank God it's all over now.

13:53.589 --> 13:55.456
And we're still here,

13:55.490 --> 13:57.858
if worse for wear.

13:59.594 --> 14:01.962
Though you seem well.

14:01.996 --> 14:04.430
You sound surprised.

14:04.465 --> 14:06.733
Despite recommending it,

14:06.767 --> 14:08.434
I couldn't help but
wonder if the treatment

14:08.469 --> 14:11.404
might serve only as a placebo.

14:11.438 --> 14:14.473
But you're fine, aren't you?

14:14.508 --> 14:17.443
Yes, I am.

14:17.477 --> 14:19.044
So how did it go today?

14:19.078 --> 14:21.947
I met with the leadership
on redistricting issues,

14:21.981 --> 14:25.451
and tomorrow we discuss
awarding labor contracts

14:25.485 --> 14:27.119
for the casino complex.

14:27.153 --> 14:29.487
As long as you all keep Vacarro
at an appropriate distance.

14:29.522 --> 14:32.624
This fiscal collaboration,
though necessary now,

14:32.658 --> 14:34.726
is just temporary,

14:34.760 --> 14:36.461
as is your service
on the council,

14:36.496 --> 14:39.731
though I couldn't ask
for a better placeholder.

14:39.766 --> 14:41.400
<i>Freedom's a dangerous thing.</i>

14:41.434 --> 14:44.236
I just want someone to keep
an eye on her, that's all.

14:44.270 --> 14:46.071
I'll see what I can do.

14:48.374 --> 14:50.743
I hear they found the guy
who took a shot at you.

14:50.777 --> 14:52.378
Word certainly gets around.

14:52.412 --> 14:54.347
Well, as you know,
I still have a few friends

14:54.381 --> 14:56.415
in the department.

14:56.450 --> 14:58.317
You, sir, have many.

14:58.352 --> 15:00.987
Comes with the bar.

15:01.021 --> 15:02.522
Another one, hon?

15:02.556 --> 15:04.291
A little topper's all.

15:06.928 --> 15:09.463
The Lion and the Lamb.

15:22.977 --> 15:25.145
Thanks, buddy.

15:26.314 --> 15:27.781
Let me guess--
another friend?

15:27.815 --> 15:30.584
They got everything
they need to put it to bed.

15:30.619 --> 15:32.319
Excellent.

15:34.689 --> 15:36.757
Let me have another
one of these, will you?

15:45.667 --> 15:47.300
Pulling an all-nighter?

15:48.369 --> 15:50.136
I wanna make press.

15:51.739 --> 15:55.142
That detective I told you
about-- he agreed to be named.

15:55.176 --> 15:56.910
Whoa.

15:56.945 --> 15:59.280
Ezra Stone, leaker of
the Bensenville documents,

15:59.314 --> 16:01.516
gets taken out
for his troubles.

16:01.550 --> 16:03.418
The whole thing
covered up by the cops.

16:03.452 --> 16:05.020
What about Kane being sick?

16:05.054 --> 16:06.855
You running with any of that?

16:06.889 --> 16:08.356
I don't have enough yet.

16:08.391 --> 16:11.126
Anyway, murder trumps
disease for now.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.195
And the big boss?
Not worried?

16:13.229 --> 16:15.464
He plays the political game,
but ultimately,

16:15.498 --> 16:17.366
Baine's only interest
is the bottom line.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.635
And this--

16:19.669 --> 16:21.703
this is gonna sell
a lot of papers.

16:26.039 --> 16:27.307
Night, Sam...

16:33.250 --> 16:35.818
Can I use one of the cars?

16:35.853 --> 16:39.489
- Where are you going?
- Apartment hunting.

16:39.523 --> 16:41.057
Shouldn't you find a job first?

16:41.091 --> 16:43.092
I plan on doing that, too.

16:43.127 --> 16:46.396
And I-- I might go out
and see a friend later.

16:47.631 --> 16:50.300
- Who's your friend?
- Ian.

16:50.334 --> 16:52.402
I don't think it's a good
idea for you to be spending

16:52.436 --> 16:55.304
so much time with one
of your father's employees.

16:55.338 --> 16:58.474
- <i>How well do you</i>
<i>even know him?</i> - Enough.

17:00.476 --> 17:02.678
You look nice.
Special occasion?

17:04.079 --> 17:05.614
Just work.

17:09.385 --> 17:11.553
We've compiled a tentative list

17:11.587 --> 17:13.454
of contractors
for the casino project.

17:13.489 --> 17:17.458
I think you'll see we've done
our best to spread the wealth,

17:17.492 --> 17:21.830
with special attention being
paid to the 21st, of course,

17:21.865 --> 17:25.434
as well as the list sent over
from your office, Mr. Vacarro.

17:26.469 --> 17:29.405
Seems pretty reasonable
thus far.

17:29.439 --> 17:32.708
I'm sorry.

17:32.743 --> 17:34.510
I wasn't clear.

17:34.545 --> 17:36.112
That list I gave

17:36.146 --> 17:37.847
wasn't a suggestion.

17:37.881 --> 17:40.150
And we all have our lists.

17:41.953 --> 17:44.154
We expected there'd be
some growing pains,

17:44.188 --> 17:46.924
this being your first
initiative with the city,

17:46.958 --> 17:50.093
but the mayor has a system
for the division of labor--

17:50.128 --> 17:52.329
Meredith, you know
how grateful I am

17:52.364 --> 17:55.033
for everything you've done
to bring this deal together.

17:55.067 --> 17:57.835
It was a delicate dance,

17:57.870 --> 18:00.872
which you executed brilliantly.

18:00.906 --> 18:04.709
But since the city
isn't actually putting

18:04.744 --> 18:06.912
any money into this endeavor,

18:06.946 --> 18:10.516
<i>it seems to me I have</i>
<i>no real reason to take orders</i>

18:10.550 --> 18:13.219
about who I can or can't hire.

18:13.253 --> 18:17.891
Mr. Vacarro, you're setting
roots down in the 21st.

18:17.925 --> 18:22.195
It might behoove you
to ingratiate yourself

18:22.230 --> 18:23.964
to your new neighbors.

18:23.998 --> 18:25.732
William.

18:25.767 --> 18:27.267
May I call you William?

18:28.870 --> 18:32.506
I'd be happy to give
the custodial contract

18:32.540 --> 18:35.242
up to your discretion
as a courtesy.

18:36.711 --> 18:39.580
- Generous.
- Please apologize to the mayor.

18:39.614 --> 18:41.916
I feel really terrible
about the confusion,

18:41.950 --> 18:44.218
but unfortunately,
I can't go forward

18:44.253 --> 18:47.521
without full control
over all contractors.

18:49.191 --> 18:50.691
I'm sure the mayor
can be persuaded

18:50.726 --> 18:52.660
to make some concessions.

18:52.695 --> 18:55.430
This is just a starting
point in our discussions.

18:55.464 --> 18:56.965
<i>The mayor was very clear</i>

18:56.999 --> 18:58.800
this meeting wasn't
to be a negotiation.

18:58.835 --> 19:01.269
I'm glad to convey your
sentiments when I see him next,

19:01.303 --> 19:02.837
but perhaps I should
set a meeting

19:02.871 --> 19:04.872
so you can discuss
the situation personally.

19:04.907 --> 19:07.375
That's a wonderful idea.

19:07.409 --> 19:09.243
How about lunch on the boat?

19:09.278 --> 19:10.778
The three of us?

19:14.817 --> 19:18.486
After a painstaking
investigat--

19:18.521 --> 19:20.989
after a thorough
investigation--

19:21.023 --> 19:22.924
Try rigorous.

19:25.228 --> 19:28.096
I'm confident we found
the actual shooter.

19:28.130 --> 19:31.432
- So, where's this happening?
- Out front.

19:33.969 --> 19:36.938
After a rigorous investigation,

19:36.972 --> 19:39.174
my office has identified
a person of interest--

19:39.208 --> 19:42.677
A few weeks ago,
Ben Zajac was this close

19:42.711 --> 19:44.345
to dropping out of the race.

19:47.583 --> 19:50.885
While I appreciate the outcome,

19:50.919 --> 19:54.588
we both know your sacrifice
was not without pleasure.

19:57.091 --> 19:59.993
The attempted assassination
of a mayor is a rare thing.

20:00.027 --> 20:03.463
Solving it provides me
with public recognition

20:03.497 --> 20:05.431
I seldom have
the chance to enjoy.

20:05.465 --> 20:08.200
So, no, Claire,

20:08.234 --> 20:11.470
you will not be
joining me at the podium.

20:11.504 --> 20:13.104
My name is Jeff Doyle

20:13.139 --> 20:15.573
and I am the Cook County
State's Attorney.

20:15.608 --> 20:18.143
After a rigorous investigation,

20:18.177 --> 20:21.680
my office identified
a person of interest

20:21.714 --> 20:23.315
in the shooting
of Meredith Kane

20:23.350 --> 20:26.085
and attempted assassination
of Mayor Tom Kane.

20:26.119 --> 20:29.054
Armed with a search warrant,

20:29.122 --> 20:32.158
we took steps to apprehend
Francis Boetker,

20:32.192 --> 20:36.328
an apparent white supremacist
with both skill and access

20:36.363 --> 20:38.798
to the type of weaponry
used in said shooting.

20:38.832 --> 20:42.301
In doing so, our investigators

20:42.335 --> 20:44.670
discovered Boetker
was in fact deceased.

20:44.704 --> 20:46.571
Bam, hot off the presses.

20:46.605 --> 20:48.639
While we await the
official coroner's report,

20:48.674 --> 20:51.042
I can tell you cause of death

20:51.076 --> 20:53.811
will likely be ruled a suicide.

20:53.845 --> 20:56.915
It is my belief that Mr
. Boetker, knowing my office

20:56.949 --> 20:59.984
was closing in on him,
elected to take his own life.

21:00.019 --> 21:02.053
Excuse me for cutting
in, Jeff, but...

21:02.088 --> 21:04.756
Oh, it's unbelievable.
He's hijacking the damn thing.

21:04.791 --> 21:06.258
<i>...Police Department,
which is germane</i>

21:06.292 --> 21:08.527
<i>to this announcement</i>
<i>and to me personally.</i>

21:08.561 --> 21:11.664
The weapon used by Mr
. Boetker to end his own life

21:11.698 --> 21:15.368
is a ballistic match
to the same weapon...

21:17.037 --> 21:20.472
which killed my dear friend
and colleague Ezra Stone.

21:20.507 --> 21:23.609
- My God. Holy shit.
<i>- Apparently, these two men,</i>

21:23.643 --> 21:27.846
Chad Langley
and Francis Boetker,

21:27.880 --> 21:29.581
motivated by racism and hatred

21:29.615 --> 21:31.116
of my administration's
policies,

21:31.150 --> 21:34.019
worked in concert
to systematically remove me

21:34.053 --> 21:36.055
<i>and my closest advisor.</i>

21:36.089 --> 21:37.689
Dude, you seriously
got it wrong.

21:37.724 --> 21:40.058
I'm going to City Hall.

21:40.093 --> 21:41.627
Fuck.

21:41.661 --> 21:44.096
Pull-- pull the online.

21:47.499 --> 21:51.202
- <i>As I was saying...</i>
- Call the trucks back.

21:51.236 --> 21:53.804
Well, then have them pull
the copy from the stands!

21:53.839 --> 21:55.673
Fuck!

21:55.707 --> 21:57.508
It's a good thing no one
reads the paper anymore.

21:57.542 --> 22:00.043
Fuck!

22:00.078 --> 22:02.946
Fuck!

22:02.981 --> 22:05.349
<i>The state's attorney</i>
<i>named Francis Boetker</i>

22:05.383 --> 22:08.251
<i>as the likely shooter in the
O'Hare assassination attempt</i>

22:08.286 --> 22:11.588
<i>that resulted in Meredith Kane
being struck by a bullet.</i>

22:11.623 --> 22:14.458
<i>He is alleged to be</i>
<i>a coconspirator in the crime</i>

22:14.492 --> 22:16.259
<i>with Chad Langley,</i>
<i>who is being held</i>

22:16.294 --> 22:17.928
<i>at a state</i>
<i>psychiatric facility.</i>

22:17.962 --> 22:21.165
<i>Little is known about Boetker,</i>
<i>who appears to have lived</i>

22:21.199 --> 22:23.300
<i>much of his life off the grid.</i>

22:28.006 --> 22:30.374
<i>- Mayor Kane.</i>
- Step back and let the mayor pass.

22:30.408 --> 22:32.142
<i>He has no comment at this time.</i>

22:32.177 --> 22:34.311
Did you know Mr. Boetker
or ever interact with him?

22:34.346 --> 22:35.813
No, I did not know this man,

22:35.847 --> 22:39.317
nor will I ever comprehend
his heinous actions

22:39.351 --> 22:41.719
or forgive him his crimes.

22:45.724 --> 22:47.592
- That's all I have to say.
- The mayor has no further comment.

22:47.626 --> 22:50.495
<i>Please clear the way, clear the
way.</i>

22:52.331 --> 22:55.867
He's been listening to us,
watching us do God knows what.

22:55.901 --> 22:57.368
You can't say that for sure.

22:57.403 --> 22:59.037
What do you think
those holes are, Sean?

22:59.071 --> 23:01.873
When was the last time we hung
goddamn streamers in our bedroom?

23:01.907 --> 23:03.875
You need to take it easy.

23:03.910 --> 23:05.477
Look, would he really do that?

23:05.512 --> 23:07.979
I'm sure he's done worse.

23:08.014 --> 23:10.582
You don't know
what kind of man he is.

23:16.756 --> 23:18.857
Get me a hammer.

23:22.595 --> 23:25.263
- Honor to meet you, Mr. Mayor.
- Likewise.

23:25.297 --> 23:27.399
Trey is taking
Kenya Taylor's place.

23:27.433 --> 23:31.102
Ah. Tragedy does beget
fortune on occasion.

23:31.137 --> 23:33.105
Please.

23:33.139 --> 23:34.973
Let's dispense
with the small talk

23:35.008 --> 23:37.910
and get to what promises
to be a problem.

23:37.944 --> 23:41.413
Mr. Vacarro does not
like to share.

23:41.448 --> 23:45.184
As is true with his kind,
greed is a factor.

23:45.218 --> 23:47.219
His kind.

23:47.254 --> 23:49.755
My wife assures me
that Mr. Vacarro

23:49.789 --> 23:53.325
has no relationship
with his rather infamous kin.

23:53.360 --> 23:56.195
Give me a fuckin' break.

23:56.229 --> 23:58.230
Fruit don't ever fall
that far from the tree.

23:59.767 --> 24:03.302
Since the 21st will be home
to this casino complex,

24:03.337 --> 24:06.405
it only makes sense
that our contractors

24:06.440 --> 24:07.974
be given first consideration.

24:08.008 --> 24:10.143
And yet without
Mr. Vacarro's generosity,

24:10.177 --> 24:11.844
there'd be nothing
to build at all.

24:13.180 --> 24:16.114
Control, fraternity--

24:16.149 --> 24:20.418
the proper balance of power
must be established early on

24:20.452 --> 24:22.653
or we're gonna have
a war on our hands.

24:22.687 --> 24:25.590
And in my ward, we'll win.

24:25.624 --> 24:28.392
Your ward?

24:31.196 --> 24:33.732
- I will look into it.
<i>- I'd appreciate it.</i>

24:33.766 --> 24:36.234
Oh, and you'd be
interested in knowing

24:36.268 --> 24:39.170
that your wife's taken to her
aldermanic responsibilities

24:39.205 --> 24:40.905
like a duck to water.

24:40.940 --> 24:44.076
Seems prepared
to fully represent

24:44.110 --> 24:45.878
the people of the 11th Ward.

24:45.912 --> 24:47.847
I'll look into that, too.

24:50.284 --> 24:52.619
Dinovo, it's me again.
What the fuck?

24:52.653 --> 24:54.554
Where are you?
Call me.

24:54.588 --> 24:56.055
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I don't buy it--</i>

24:56.090 --> 24:58.091
this whole twofer story
Kane's spinning.

24:58.125 --> 25:00.760
- Hard to fight ballistics.
- I know, but it's bullshit.

25:00.794 --> 25:02.361
What are you going to do?

25:02.396 --> 25:04.697
Officially, I'm going to
backpedal, but only on page two.

25:04.732 --> 25:06.032
Dinovo knows more
than he's telling.

25:06.066 --> 25:07.233
I just have to push him harder.

25:07.267 --> 25:08.501
Push the sick angle, too.

25:08.535 --> 25:11.671
Good, because whatever
he had done in Canada--

25:11.705 --> 25:13.172
I don't think it worked.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.108
What do you mean?

25:15.142 --> 25:17.644
I saw his hand shake, Sam,

25:17.678 --> 25:19.145
outside City Hall.

25:19.180 --> 25:20.647
Not sure anyone else caught it,

25:20.681 --> 25:23.150
but looked like a tremor to me.

25:23.184 --> 25:25.252
I love you.

25:25.286 --> 25:26.787
Was broadcasting there?

25:28.356 --> 25:30.691
WLOZ, I think.

25:30.725 --> 25:32.793
I'll be back.

25:38.966 --> 25:41.635
I am closing in, you asshole.

25:59.854 --> 26:01.688
Darius.

26:03.457 --> 26:06.259
I talked to E.Z.
He said you were here.

26:10.363 --> 26:13.432
I wanted to thank you
for what you did for me

26:13.466 --> 26:16.735
and to see how you were.

26:18.071 --> 26:20.272
It's all good.

26:22.075 --> 26:23.842
What's wrong with you?

26:25.645 --> 26:27.146
You don't know?

26:36.389 --> 26:39.659
Oh, Darius.
Darius.

26:39.693 --> 26:42.028
Leave me the fuck alone!

27:18.397 --> 27:20.098
<i>Miss O'Neil is
back for some reason.</i>

27:20.132 --> 27:22.600
Do you want to see her?

27:22.635 --> 27:25.270
- What's it about?
- <i>Sam Miller.</i>

27:25.304 --> 27:28.072
I had my lawyer send a cease
and desist letter to him.

27:28.107 --> 27:30.408
He had tried to accuse me of
something that I never said.

27:30.442 --> 27:32.376
He is quite the fabricator.

27:32.411 --> 27:34.078
Well, I just wanted you
to know that I never

27:34.112 --> 27:37.247
disclosed anything to him,
or anyone for that matter,

27:37.282 --> 27:41.418
not that there wasn't pressure
to do so from all sides.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.253
I don't know.
I think a part of me

27:43.287 --> 27:46.723
always just hoped that
someday I'd be back.

27:47.758 --> 27:50.326
I meant what I said
before, sir.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.161
I want to work for you again,

27:52.195 --> 27:54.897
hopefully in a larger capacity.

27:56.601 --> 27:59.369
A lot of water under the
bridge, I'm afraid.

27:59.404 --> 28:01.572
I realize that.

28:03.408 --> 28:06.110
But if there's anything

28:06.145 --> 28:08.213
I can do...

28:10.383 --> 28:13.786
<i>any way that I can...</i>

28:13.820 --> 28:15.988
prove myself to you...

28:21.595 --> 28:23.263
I'm not sure that's possible.

28:23.297 --> 28:25.565
Allow me to try.

28:32.371 --> 28:34.106
<i>Because the truth is</i>

28:34.140 --> 28:37.809
no one knows how you
operate better than I do.

28:37.983 --> 28:41.242
And I don't think you or
anyone else can really argue that.

28:46.686 --> 28:49.254
All right,

28:49.288 --> 28:51.990
on a trial basis.

28:52.025 --> 28:54.059
Ezra's position.

28:54.093 --> 28:57.796
Ian's already handling yours.

29:00.562 --> 29:01.702
Sounds good.

29:04.638 --> 29:07.173
<i>When can I start?</i>

29:07.207 --> 29:09.609
<i>- How about Monday?</i>
- We're in.

29:09.643 --> 29:11.544
<i>Catching the man behind
an assassination attempt</i>

29:11.578 --> 29:13.646
on the mayor is no small feat.

29:13.681 --> 29:16.449
It's the kind of case
a man can build a name on

29:16.483 --> 29:18.985
or at least get
a lot of publicity for.

29:20.588 --> 29:23.823
Well, I think it's fair to say

29:23.858 --> 29:26.059
I've earned my moment.

29:28.529 --> 29:31.998
So, all this really necessary
to deal with a crooked alderman

29:32.032 --> 29:33.632
and a few union leaders
on the take?

29:33.667 --> 29:37.502
Jeff's nothing if not thorough.

29:42.008 --> 29:45.310
We agreed to full transparency,

29:45.344 --> 29:47.112
and yet you failed
to mention you're planning

29:47.146 --> 29:48.847
to challenge Kane next primary.

29:48.881 --> 29:52.083
It's under serious
consideration.

29:52.118 --> 29:55.187
And as a man as
unimpeachable as yourself,

29:55.221 --> 29:57.556
it wouldn't be prudent to
remain in your current position

29:57.590 --> 30:00.293
should this office decide
to investigate the mayor.

30:00.327 --> 30:01.694
I'd resign.

30:01.728 --> 30:04.330
Leaving a vacancy that the
next governor should fill.

30:05.499 --> 30:07.801
I have excellent references.

30:07.835 --> 30:09.770
You got the job, sweetheart.

30:09.804 --> 30:11.738
Will you excuse us, please?

30:24.062 --> 30:26.006
A lot of mayoral
files you've got here.

30:28.321 --> 30:30.789
Kane will pay for his crimes.

30:30.823 --> 30:32.524
If these records
weren't enough,

30:32.558 --> 30:36.461
his alliance with Vacarro
certainly will be.

30:36.495 --> 30:40.164
And on the political front--

30:40.198 --> 30:42.300
I want to ramp up
an aggressive field campaign,

30:42.334 --> 30:44.035
put all the money
into paid organizers,

30:44.069 --> 30:46.004
focus on building relationships

30:46.038 --> 30:49.941
block by block, union hall by
union hall, church by church.

30:49.976 --> 30:53.878
This is no longer about an
election-- mine or yours.

30:53.913 --> 30:57.048
This is about a slow and deliberate
recalibration of the machine.

31:01.053 --> 31:03.221
<i>The "Chicago Sentinel" scandal</i>

31:03.256 --> 31:05.357
<i>has escalated</i>
<i>to the next level.</i>

31:05.391 --> 31:08.961
<i>Take a look at what WPHG</i>
<i>received just hours ago--</i>

31:08.995 --> 31:10.829
- <i>the tape sent anonymously...</i>
- All right, whatever.

31:10.864 --> 31:12.698
It's my first retraction.
So shoot me.

31:12.732 --> 31:14.433
<i>...but appears
to show Sam Miller,</i>

31:14.468 --> 31:17.236
the editor of the "Sentinel,"
allegedly paying a source

31:17.271 --> 31:19.539
for a story that has
since been refuted.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.908
<i>Such a breach</i>
<i>of journalistic ethic</i>

31:21.942 --> 31:24.677
may hit hard at the paper,
which in recent months

31:24.712 --> 31:26.179
<i>has struggled to stay afloat.</i>

31:26.213 --> 31:27.681
<i>Of course, the refuted story</i>

31:27.715 --> 31:29.549
<i>accused the Chicago</i>
<i>Police Department</i>

31:29.583 --> 31:33.854
<i>of covering up the murder</i>
<i>of mayoral advisor Ezra Stone.</i>

31:33.888 --> 31:36.824
Miller alleged that
CPD was ordered

31:36.858 --> 31:39.861
to make Stone's homicide look
like a burglary gone wrong.

31:39.895 --> 31:43.061
...Chicago * outrage <i>by the
scandal of the Chicago's Sentinel,"</i>

31:43.096 --> 31:43.732
<i>which continues to grow.</i>

31:43.766 --> 31:45.333
<i>You're looking</i>
<i>at the anonymous tape</i>

31:45.368 --> 31:47.870
<i>which WLOZ received</i>
<i>earlier today.</i>

31:47.904 --> 31:50.740
<i>Now that is "Sentinel"
editor Sam Miller.</i>

31:50.774 --> 31:53.342
- <i>And as you can see...</i>
- How did she do today, my wife,

31:53.376 --> 31:55.611
with Ross and the others?

31:55.645 --> 31:57.379
Quite well.

31:57.414 --> 32:00.082
I hear reservations

32:00.117 --> 32:02.318
or perhaps resentment

32:02.352 --> 32:03.986
<i>at my having appointed</i>
<i>her to that seat.</i>

32:04.020 --> 32:05.488
None at all.

32:05.522 --> 32:07.023
I respect the First Lady
immensely

32:07.057 --> 32:09.158
and I think she'll do
a bang-up job.

32:09.192 --> 32:11.494
Which isn't to say I'm not
aware of certain dynamics

32:11.528 --> 32:13.996
that may prove troublesome
as time goes on.

32:14.031 --> 32:15.799
Such as?

32:15.833 --> 32:17.433
When dealing
with experienced players,

32:17.468 --> 32:20.069
the rules of the game
always apply.

32:20.103 --> 32:22.338
But when a novice
is introduced to the team,

32:22.372 --> 32:24.440
sometimes those rules
get subverted.

32:24.475 --> 32:26.876
- Vacarro.
- Don't get me wrong, he's a nice guy.

32:26.911 --> 32:29.379
The ladies in the room certainly
seem quite charmed by him,

32:29.414 --> 32:31.448
which is always a disadvantage.

32:31.482 --> 32:33.884
I believe Mrs. Kane is meeting
with him privately today

32:33.918 --> 32:37.321
- in an effort to...
- Advise him of the rules.

32:38.556 --> 32:40.491
I would think so.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.628
Why are you in Ezra's office?

32:44.663 --> 32:46.964
Shouldn't you be in Kitty's?

32:46.998 --> 32:49.099
I am, sir.

32:49.134 --> 32:51.735
Oh, right.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.838
My mistake.

32:57.809 --> 32:59.577
Can I help you?

32:59.611 --> 33:02.680
Uh, yeah, I was wondering if you
can let me into Ian's apartment.

33:02.714 --> 33:04.348
I forgot my keys

33:04.382 --> 33:05.916
and I can't get ahold
of him at work.

33:05.950 --> 33:08.217
- Who are you?
- His girlfriend.

33:09.753 --> 33:12.388
Look, I-- I just need
to see him to talk to him.

33:12.423 --> 33:15.292
He works for my father.
That's how we met.

33:15.326 --> 33:17.093
I promise you won't
get in trouble.

33:17.128 --> 33:19.395
I'm Emma Kane.

33:25.269 --> 33:28.372
Come on.

33:28.406 --> 33:32.109
We've barely finished discussing
the first proposal here.

33:32.143 --> 33:33.777
Well...

33:35.313 --> 33:38.749
...at this rate, we might
just be here all day.

33:40.652 --> 33:43.688
Come on, when was the last time
you were out on the water?

33:47.660 --> 33:49.360
Since forever.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.796
It's good for you,
the air out here.

33:51.831 --> 33:54.199
Clears your head.

33:55.768 --> 33:58.337
It's a shame your husband
couldn't come today.

33:58.371 --> 34:01.807
I looked forward to getting
to know him better.

34:06.212 --> 34:08.179
Can I ask you something?

34:08.214 --> 34:10.081
It's personal,

34:10.116 --> 34:13.719
maybe... inappropriate.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.255
You can ask.

34:19.993 --> 34:22.527
Why do you stand behind him

34:22.562 --> 34:25.164
when you're capable of so
much more on your own?

34:31.705 --> 34:33.306
Because I have patience.

34:34.542 --> 34:36.677
Patience.

34:36.710 --> 34:39.647
I've never been much for that.

34:41.449 --> 34:43.217
Yeah.

34:43.251 --> 34:46.286
You strike me as someone
who takes what he wants

34:46.321 --> 34:48.322
when he wants it.

35:28.928 --> 35:31.697
I remember seeing him
once early on--

35:31.731 --> 35:33.999
the man with the gray hair.

35:34.034 --> 35:35.467
I didn't know his name.

35:35.502 --> 35:38.003
<i>I just knew he worked</i>
<i>for you and Ezra.</i>

35:39.139 --> 35:40.606
<i>The other one--</i>
<i>Langley--</i>

35:40.640 --> 35:43.175
<i>was he supposed to take</i>
<i>the fall for it?</i>

35:46.379 --> 35:48.680
Glaucoma.
Who knew?

35:48.715 --> 35:51.483
So they kept looking
for the real sniper.

35:51.518 --> 35:53.318
You knew eventually
they'd find him,

35:53.353 --> 35:55.287
making him a liability.

35:55.321 --> 35:58.124
Was your wife the target?

35:58.158 --> 36:00.325
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

36:04.831 --> 36:06.431
Shock the public into sympathy,

36:06.466 --> 36:09.468
<i>get their support to dig you</i>
<i>out of Bensenville,</i>

36:09.502 --> 36:12.104
<i>push through Lennox Gardens.</i>

36:12.138 --> 36:15.106
Political capital by way
of an assassination attempt.

36:17.210 --> 36:20.178
So what happened?
What went wrong?

36:20.213 --> 36:24.950
I was distracted
by something, someone.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.354
Reared back at the last second

36:28.388 --> 36:32.057
and pulled us both
into the line of fire.

36:33.826 --> 36:36.628
I meant it when I said
I wanted back in.

36:36.663 --> 36:38.530
Why?

36:42.968 --> 36:44.769
It's where I belong.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.810
I don't have much time.

36:54.346 --> 36:56.580
Then we should make
the most of it.

37:01.519 --> 37:03.354
Yeah.

37:47.367 --> 37:50.870
Okay, I know it looks bad,
but it can be explained.

37:50.904 --> 37:52.905
- No, it cannot.
- I'll resign as editor.

37:52.940 --> 37:54.507
I'll go back to reporting.
I prefer it anyway.

37:54.541 --> 37:57.143
- Mr. Miller--
- You don't understand.

37:59.246 --> 38:02.682
I'm about to break
a huge, irrefutable story.

38:02.716 --> 38:04.183
The mayor is sick.

38:04.218 --> 38:06.018
He has been to a brain
clinic in Canada.

38:06.053 --> 38:08.020
He's seeing a neurologist.
He has tremors.

38:08.055 --> 38:12.124
Even if that were true,
which I seriously doubt,

38:12.158 --> 38:16.395
<i>no one can ever believe</i>
<i>another word that you say.</i>

38:16.430 --> 38:19.432
This just came for you
from Mona Fredricks.

38:19.466 --> 38:20.934
Security had to go through it,

38:20.968 --> 38:23.336
you know, make sure
it was safe,

38:23.370 --> 38:24.871
which it is.

39:20.398 --> 39:22.654
You don't always
always need to be her,

39:23.586 --> 39:24.908
not with me.

39:26.063 --> 39:27.840
I see the burden you carry.

39:28.072 --> 39:30.140
You shouldn't have to.

40:24.526 --> 40:25.993
No. What?

40:26.028 --> 40:27.795
They-- they can't
just do this.

40:27.796 --> 40:30.097
- They can't-- they can't just fire you.
- They can and they should.

40:30.132 --> 40:31.799
Did you tell them about this?

40:31.834 --> 40:33.668
Did you tell them
that we actually have

40:33.702 --> 40:35.170
the mayor on tape
having a tremor?

40:35.204 --> 40:37.572
That WLOZ wasn't even
going to use this footage?

40:40.810 --> 40:43.812
You've got to put this away.
Bentley will kill it here.

40:45.148 --> 40:46.782
Do what you got to do
to take it back to the station

40:46.817 --> 40:48.318
to a guy named
Larry Hester, okay?

40:48.352 --> 40:49.953
He's a good guy.
He's a serious reporter.

40:49.987 --> 40:51.955
Give him everything.

40:51.989 --> 40:53.556
Give him all my files.
Give him that.

40:53.590 --> 40:55.224
Tell him that he has
to run it tonight.

40:55.258 --> 40:57.159
No, Sam.
This is your story.

40:57.193 --> 41:00.729
Look, I have lost
all credibility.

41:01.864 --> 41:03.531
It's too important
a story not to break.

41:03.566 --> 41:06.200
You have to do it, Jackie.
You have to.

41:10.638 --> 41:12.472
They're here to walk you
out of the building.

41:21.816 --> 41:23.284
Don't worry.

41:23.318 --> 41:25.720
We'll get things
back to normal around here.

41:33.529 --> 41:35.597
So, how's it feel

41:35.631 --> 41:38.533
to be in what will soon
be your new home?

41:39.735 --> 41:41.502
It's something.

41:41.537 --> 41:44.505
No, of course you'll have your
wife come in and redecorate.

41:46.442 --> 41:49.177
That's right.
Gee, I'm sorry.

41:49.211 --> 41:51.846
Ha, stuck my foot
in my mouth with that one.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.715
- No problem.
- Anyway,

41:53.749 --> 41:57.185
the state legislature is
putting forth a piece of law

41:57.220 --> 41:58.687
that'll help grease the wheels

41:58.721 --> 42:01.122
for this casino complex
we've got going up.

42:01.157 --> 42:04.726
- Now, when it's signed--
- Technically, I could veto.

42:04.761 --> 42:06.228
You could.

42:06.263 --> 42:08.364
Mr. Zajac, I'm getting
the feeling

42:08.398 --> 42:11.367
you're not as on board with
this as I was led to believe.

42:11.401 --> 42:15.271
Just making sure all
constituents are being served.

42:15.305 --> 42:17.273
The Catholic Church,
for instance--

42:17.307 --> 42:18.708
dead set against
this kind of gambling.

42:18.742 --> 42:20.910
Cuts into
their bingo hall money,

42:20.944 --> 42:22.712
which generates millions.

42:22.746 --> 42:24.113
The point is--

42:24.147 --> 42:25.882
They represent a very
powerful voter block.

42:25.916 --> 42:27.383
That's all I'm saying.

42:27.417 --> 42:30.052
Correct me if I'm wrong,

42:30.087 --> 42:32.588
but I'm pretty sure
Tom Kane's responsible

42:32.622 --> 42:34.557
for your ass being
a few months' shy

42:34.591 --> 42:36.092
of sitting in this chair.

42:38.729 --> 42:41.331
He can't stay
in office forever, Mac.

42:41.365 --> 42:43.566
It's got to change sometime.

42:49.038 --> 42:51.206
What?

42:51.241 --> 42:55.243
You're back with Kane after
everything you know he did?

42:55.278 --> 42:56.745
You mean everything
that was proven wrong?

42:56.779 --> 42:58.280
He fucking has people killed.

42:59.816 --> 43:01.416
I don't know what
you're talking about.

43:01.451 --> 43:03.352
- That's funny to you?
- And even if you did,

43:03.386 --> 43:04.853
I don't think I'd believe you.

43:04.888 --> 43:07.790
Are you attracted
to that sort of thing?

43:07.824 --> 43:10.358
Creeps with power, assholes
who treat you like shit?

43:11.894 --> 43:13.762
Get out of my way, please.

43:16.098 --> 43:17.565
You know, there was
a minute there

43:17.600 --> 43:19.601
when I thought we actually
had something.

43:24.573 --> 43:26.574
Good luck
with chumpbait.com.

43:29.377 --> 43:31.278
<i>Kitty.</i>

43:33.482 --> 43:36.751
Be sure to watch
the 7:00 news tonight.

44:22.078 --> 44:24.176
Miss O'Neil, the Mayor specifically
asked for...

44:26.469 --> 44:29.370
You need to call security and tell them
that they can't just let anyone up here.

44:29.405 --> 44:31.005
How much fucking clearer
do I have to be

44:31.039 --> 44:34.308
about nonemployees
on the fifth floor?

44:34.342 --> 44:36.310
Hey, you didn't see?

44:36.344 --> 44:38.278
She's got a badge.

44:40.849 --> 44:43.451
Obviously whatever Miller knew
he leaked to broadcast.

44:43.485 --> 44:45.219
What could he have?

44:45.254 --> 44:48.322
There's nothing.
He's nothing.

44:48.357 --> 44:50.291
Well, he knew about your trip
to Canada during the riots.

44:50.326 --> 44:51.793
I know that much.

44:51.827 --> 44:54.062
Does he have proof?

44:54.096 --> 44:56.531
Not to my knowledge, no.

44:56.565 --> 44:58.300
Nor does he have a diagnosis.

44:58.334 --> 45:00.302
He just--

45:00.337 --> 45:04.173
he knew that
you were... sick.

45:06.944 --> 45:08.411
<i>Sir, in order</i>
<i>for me to help you,</i>

45:08.445 --> 45:12.381
I should probably know
exactly what...

45:21.826 --> 45:23.993
Lewy Body Dementia.

45:38.510 --> 45:41.178
Would you please have
someone find my wife?

45:41.213 --> 45:43.514
Yeah.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.717
We should probably get
Dr. Harris in here, too,

45:47.752 --> 45:50.086
just in case we need
to go public with something.

46:36.065 --> 46:37.632
<i>Was it worth it?</i>

46:40.802 --> 46:42.770
It was a setup, all right?

46:42.804 --> 46:45.539
- The mayor set me up.
- Oh, yeah?

46:45.573 --> 46:47.741
He hold a gun to your
head at the bank?

46:50.478 --> 46:52.846
At most he'd have symptoms,
nothing specific.

46:52.880 --> 46:54.714
But if you're outed for any,
they'll want answers--

46:54.748 --> 46:56.583
a diagnosis, to hear
from your doctor.

46:56.617 --> 46:58.284
Who was supposed to be
calibrating medications

46:58.319 --> 47:01.754
and controlling this disease
so no one would know.

47:01.789 --> 47:04.790
I think we're past the point
of trying to cover this up.

47:13.867 --> 47:16.235
You've done all you can to
fight the physical symptoms,

47:16.270 --> 47:18.037
even at the expense
of your sanity.

47:18.072 --> 47:19.572
- I know.
- You have to decide

47:19.606 --> 47:21.074
what you'd rather
be in control of--

47:21.108 --> 47:22.575
your appearance or your mind.

47:22.609 --> 47:25.445
I said I know, God damn it!

47:27.815 --> 47:29.316
Where's my fucking wife?

47:32.120 --> 47:35.155
- It's over, isn't it?
- No, it is not!

47:53.041 --> 47:55.576
All right, I'll start
neuroleptics.

47:56.778 --> 48:00.047
Clarity, judgment,

48:00.081 --> 48:03.017
no hallucinations--

48:03.051 --> 48:04.551
that's what's important now.

48:04.586 --> 48:08.355
If it comes to it, you'll
need to explain to the media

48:08.389 --> 48:11.191
how little the disease affects
his ability to do the job.

48:11.226 --> 48:13.761
I'm not sure in good conscience
I can say that it won't.

48:13.795 --> 48:17.265
Well, it's a little late
for conscience.

48:20.169 --> 48:21.703
<i>Let's see what
comes out first--</i>

48:21.737 --> 48:24.573
the extent of it,
the accuracy of it.

48:24.608 --> 48:27.176
If it is your disease,
we hit back hard--

48:27.210 --> 48:30.746
attack the invasion of
privacy and then we own it.

48:30.781 --> 48:32.348
<i>Or some version of it.</i>

48:32.382 --> 48:34.183
No, it'd be the only
play at that point.

48:36.386 --> 48:38.387
I'll get started
on a statement.

48:47.997 --> 48:51.000
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

49:01.311 --> 49:04.714
Coming up, a political scandal
that will shock the state,

49:04.748 --> 49:07.016
<i>then what media baron</i>
<i>Peter Baine has to say</i>

49:07.050 --> 49:09.351
<i>about the "Chicago Sentinel"</i>
<i>editor who paid</i>

49:09.386 --> 49:11.854
<i>for a front-page story</i>
<i>that turned out to be false.</i>

49:11.888 --> 49:12.955
- Ben?
- Hey.

49:12.989 --> 49:15.157
You won't want to miss it
tonight at 7:00.

49:18.661 --> 49:21.963
- Where are the kids?
- My mother's.

49:21.997 --> 49:24.098
Is there a problem
with the lawyers?

49:24.133 --> 49:27.502
No, just felt like
we needed to talk.

49:30.806 --> 49:33.173
- All right.
- So...

49:35.877 --> 49:38.145
Heard you on the radio.

49:45.387 --> 49:47.588
I assume you made
peace with Kane.

49:49.625 --> 49:51.092
Superficially.

49:51.126 --> 49:53.628
<i>He's not getting</i>
<i>reelected, Maggie.</i>

49:53.662 --> 49:55.496
Doyle's going to run
against him,

49:55.531 --> 49:58.600
and he's got 20 years' worth of
oppo research to do it with.

49:58.634 --> 50:01.603
And you know this because
you're on his team now.

50:05.642 --> 50:08.076
A lot's changed since I left.

50:09.846 --> 50:12.648
Have your higher aspirations?

50:13.716 --> 50:15.817
Not at all.

50:15.852 --> 50:18.854
Because no unmarried,
unwidowed man

50:18.888 --> 50:22.825
has been elected president
since Buchanan.

50:25.495 --> 50:27.729
I am unwell,

50:27.764 --> 50:31.166
but I am not unhealthy.

50:31.201 --> 50:33.736
Sir, less than a minute.

50:38.009 --> 50:39.676
<i>This is WLOZ,</i>

50:39.710 --> 50:42.346
<i>Chicago's number one</i>
<i>news source at 7:00</i>

50:42.380 --> 50:45.015
<i>with Mollie St. John</i>
<i>and Evan Price.</i>

50:45.050 --> 50:46.917
Tonight, the robbery
of an Evanston

50:46.952 --> 50:48.786
jewelry store caught on tape.

50:48.821 --> 50:52.290
<i>A Tinley Park woman stops
traffic in an unusual way.</i>

50:52.325 --> 50:54.760
<i>But first, a report</i>
<i>that threatens to unseat</i>

50:54.794 --> 50:56.695
<i>a powerful political figure.</i>

50:57.930 --> 51:00.032
<i>State Senator Catherine Walsh</i>

51:00.066 --> 51:03.102
has been asked to testify
before a grand jury

51:03.136 --> 51:05.371
<i>in light of suspicion</i>
<i>surrounding the death</i>

51:05.406 --> 51:08.108
<i>of her aide Tina Patterson.</i>

51:08.142 --> 51:09.910
If it's not the lead story,
it's not happening.

51:27.226 --> 51:29.794
- What the fuck, Jackie?
- I'm not you, Sam.

51:31.897 --> 51:34.399
I need my job.

51:37.437 --> 51:39.138
He scares me.

51:41.107 --> 51:42.708
They scare me.

51:44.043 --> 51:46.812
And I can't do what you do.

51:46.846 --> 51:49.348
I can't be the one
to take him on.

52:11.838 --> 52:14.172
There's always other cities.

52:15.842 --> 52:19.044
Other homes,

52:19.079 --> 52:22.248
other friends, other
schools for our kids.

52:24.050 --> 52:25.518
Do you know how much I hate

52:25.552 --> 52:27.787
that he's getting
away with this?

52:30.357 --> 52:32.558
You know we can't fight him.

52:37.865 --> 52:39.732
We'll be okay.

52:42.969 --> 52:45.471
Yeah.

52:45.506 --> 52:47.507
Just not here.

52:52.647 --> 52:55.382
Sir, do you need
anything before I leave?

52:55.416 --> 52:57.217
No.

52:58.820 --> 53:01.488
I've hired Kitty back.

53:01.523 --> 53:03.123
To take Mona's place.

53:04.292 --> 53:06.160
Ezra's.

53:10.066 --> 53:11.733
Sir, I get the sense
a lot happened today

53:11.767 --> 53:13.635
that for some reason
I wasn't made privy to.

53:13.669 --> 53:16.572
Your proximity to me

53:16.606 --> 53:19.074
doesn't make you entitled

53:19.109 --> 53:21.844
to anything of mine.

53:21.878 --> 53:23.379
Anything.

53:25.082 --> 53:27.616
You want to move up,
you earn it.

53:27.651 --> 53:29.118
Don't expect me
to give it to you.

53:29.153 --> 53:33.223
And if I do, you damn well
better appreciate it.

53:34.992 --> 53:36.492
Yes, sir.

54:05.389 --> 54:07.090
Good night.

54:10.193 --> 54:11.827
'Night.

54:34.150 --> 54:35.918
I know who you are.

54:41.191 --> 54:43.192
Does it matter?

54:55.705 --> 54:57.272
I've been trying to reach you.

54:57.306 --> 55:00.509
I was out.
My phone died.

55:00.543 --> 55:02.110
Listen, I'm not feeling well.

55:02.145 --> 55:03.879
Can we talk later?

55:03.913 --> 55:05.414
You were out...

55:06.583 --> 55:08.083
during what could have
been the most important

55:08.117 --> 55:10.419
24-hour period
of my life.

55:11.788 --> 55:13.456
Did something happen?

55:13.490 --> 55:16.192
I was faced
with a decision--

55:16.227 --> 55:19.162
one I might have had to make
without your counsel.

55:24.302 --> 55:25.869
Which is strange because...

55:28.206 --> 55:32.009
I've come to rely on you
through the years,

55:32.044 --> 55:34.745
this past one in particular,

55:34.780 --> 55:38.382
during which we've
become close again,

55:38.416 --> 55:40.818
solidified our bond.

55:42.487 --> 55:44.154
Is that what you call it?

55:45.423 --> 55:48.125
A form of love, I'd think.

55:55.100 --> 55:57.768
That was never
what drew us together, Tom.

55:59.805 --> 56:02.373
Hand me my oxygen, please.

56:02.407 --> 56:04.642
I'm having some trouble
breathing.

56:14.654 --> 56:17.455
Spent as you are.

56:18.924 --> 56:20.725
What are you talking about?

56:20.759 --> 56:25.063
It's a neurotic state--
infatuation.

56:25.097 --> 56:27.933
It diminishes the ability to
judge, to make wise choices,

56:27.967 --> 56:30.736
to hold firm
to established loyalties.

56:30.770 --> 56:34.139
Tom, I need it now.

56:34.174 --> 56:36.275
- I know this...
- Ah!

56:36.309 --> 56:38.877
...because I have personally
experienced it.

56:38.912 --> 56:41.880
But unlike you,
mine was born of a disease;

56:41.915 --> 56:44.216
yours a matter of stupidity!

56:44.251 --> 56:45.918
I can't breathe!

56:45.952 --> 56:47.720
Do you realize
what you gave him?

56:47.754 --> 56:49.188
Access.

56:49.222 --> 56:51.357
Influence.
Power!

56:51.391 --> 56:52.825
I can't breathe.

57:44.008 --> 57:46.609
Mortality is inevitable...

57:48.479 --> 57:51.047
but yours will forever
be tied to mine.

57:55.486 --> 57:57.687
Remember that.
