00:31.640 --> 00:33.840
We're federal agents, we are not martyrs!

00:36.000 --> 00:37.200
This is suicide!

00:37.880 --> 00:40.720
She is just one of many
Abduction.

00:41.320 --> 00:43.160
What makes it so special?

00:45.160 --> 00:47.040
Because it is a witness against
The Torrez?

00:47.800 --> 00:53.240
He probably caught it,
and drugged-up to the tips of hair.

00:53.360 --> 00:55.120
We do not have to do this!

00:55.720 --> 00:56.800
If not us...

00:57.960 --> 00:59.200
... Who?

01:02.240 --> 01:03.160
I told you to stay still!

01:03.240 --> 01:05.720
And do not try to capture the Torrez!

01:06.880 --> 01:07.960
Turn around now!

01:09.400 --> 01:10.440
Machete, you son of a bitch!

01:10.960 --> 01:12.680
Do not listen to orders!

01:12.800 --> 01:17.360
You'll eventually kill us all!
Waiting for reinforcements!

01:41.920 --> 01:43.600
Whatever happens...

01:47.080 --> 01:47.960
I'm with you...

01:49.680 --> 01:50.040
... Boss.

02:14.720 --> 02:15.520
Sorry.

04:11.920 --> 04:15.680
I told you to stay quiet asshole.

04:17.560 --> 04:21.200
If you had listened to my orders
you would not have been caught.

04:31.840 --> 04:35.600
This is what happens when they insist
to be heroes.

05:36.000 --> 05:36.760
Burn it!

08:54.840 --> 08:57.600
You work today
and pay me tomorrow.

09:02.040 --> 09:03.800
You need a gardener?

09:22.960 --> 09:25.000
Come on. Stand back.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.080
Hurry!

09:30.760 --> 09:33.480
We have not got.
You can not leave us here!

09:34.480 --> 09:35.920
She is crazy.

12:21.280 --> 12:22.160
Hey ugly!

12:23.400 --> 12:24.640
Want to fight?

12:27.520 --> 12:30.760
Do not tell me that you let escape
$ 500 for five minutes.

27:54.280 --> 27:57.320
Most do not give illegal
standard treatment in hospitals.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.040
But thou art with us.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.360
Still nobody knows you're here.

28:01.400 --> 28:05.240
You were brought here under the name John Doe,
as a mere spectator.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.760
Yes, hold the illegals!
Close the border!

33:09.600 --> 33:12.320
Well, we're almost there.
If the close, fine by me.

33:14.840 --> 33:17.040
"Cona" Opinions should be like.

33:17.041 --> 01:54.233
This is the boss.

03:05.141 --> 03:06.167
Dress up.

03:06.585 --> 03:08.437
It is very hot to wear clothes.

03:27.060 --> 03:29.080
Saved me Torrez?

03:29.161 --> 03:30.656
Got tomatoes

03:32.559 --> 03:34.192
Just as I like...

03:38.715 --> 03:41.561
What is that large and hard?

03:41.728 --> 03:42.899
My Machete.

03:43.455 --> 03:44.512
You keen?

03:45.098 --> 03:46.102
Very

04:05.407 --> 04:07.008
I have it.

04:22.356 --> 04:23.657
How about you say?

04:24.018 --> 04:27.918
Excellent... Excellent...

04:36.519 --> 04:38.963
Why are you so insistent?

04:39.694 --> 04:43.265
Paid to all forces
the law in Mexico.

04:43.720 --> 04:46.232
I have the DEA and the federal...

04:46.371 --> 04:51.343
Why do not you? You could take
my money and look elsewhere

04:52.058 --> 04:54.303
What is your price?

04:56.243 --> 04:58.431
Let me ask your wife.

04:58.601 --> 04:59.999
Bring it.

05:10.120 --> 05:13.402
Your daughter is now in school, no?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.506
I think not.

05:23.361 --> 05:26.272
The honorable way
to die is beheaded.

05:28.994 --> 05:33.084
But you do not deserve
die with honor.

07:23.768 --> 07:26.556
<i> Three years later.

07:26.666 --> 07:28.611

07:28.612 --> 07:31.975
Director <i> site

07:31.976 --> 07:32.937
<i> Thanks, it's a pleasure to be here. &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

07:33.295 --> 07:35.855
What gives <i> steps to secure the border &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

07:36.063 --> 07:38.758
<i> ICE has many
Officers patrolling the border. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

07:38.864 --> 07:42.032
<i> But they are almost two thousand miles
border between the U. S. and Mexico, &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

07:42.417 --> 07:43.858
<i> and over half are in Texas. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

07:44.055 --> 07:46.368
<i> Therefore, we need to attack
the problem at its source. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

07:46.535 --> 07:50.914
<i> There is a support network, not
only helps illegal immigrants get &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

07:51.151 --> 07:53.159

Agency to investigate this problem. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

08:01.068 --> 08:04.643
Agent Rivera, 23, in
surveillance operation of La Red

08:06.650 --> 08:10.341
La Red seems to be managed by
a woman named Luz

08:10.342 --> 08:11.687
His nickname is "She".

08:11.688 --> 08:13.130
NT. "She" = She - that / "Che" Guevara.

08:14.667 --> 08:17.165
Light operates from a truck
selling tacos.

08:20.201 --> 08:22.421
Here's something interesting.

08:22.422 --> 08:23.383
Face... ?

08:34.607 --> 08:35.841
It's new

08:42.568 --> 08:45.451
Search the database by
possible criminal

08:45.452 --> 08:47.854
Male, Hispanic
scars, tattoos...

08:49.057 --> 08:51.735
Attitude "do not mess with me
and I do not fuck with you. "

08:56.554 --> 08:57.707
You pay me tomorrow.

09:10.024 --> 09:12.922
U. S. border - Mexico.

09:47.515 --> 09:48.476
Run

10:17.166 --> 10:19.677
Well, so little
I speak Mexican

10:19.678 --> 10:20.639
You know...

10:22.453 --> 10:25.937
are invading...
the land of my father.

10:35.378 --> 10:37.988
Jesus! Do not you see that is
Pregnant?

10:41.448 --> 10:45.195
If born here would be a
citizen like you and me.

10:46.926 --> 10:50.000
Many people do not
like us,

10:50.376 --> 10:52.297
call them "vigilantes. "

10:54.665 --> 10:56.780
Actually it's all about
surveillance.

10:58.703 --> 11:01.586
Someone has to keep this
great nation for us.

11:03.220 --> 11:04.469
Otherwise,

11:04.759 --> 11:09.275
Texas will be Mexico again

11:12.158 --> 11:13.600
Who will stop it, Senator?

11:14.946 --> 11:15.907
I

11:20.242 --> 11:21.593
Welcome to E. U.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.071
Videotaped this?

11:27.841 --> 11:31.204
Does a DVD. My supporters
thank you very much...

11:33.533 --> 11:35.499
<i> infection has begun, &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

11:42.420 --> 11:45.783
<i> But state Sen. John McLaughling
has a plan of attack &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

11:45.784 --> 11:48.282
<i> He will fight to keep
immigrants out. &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

11:48.283 --> 11:50.782
<i> He advocates a fence electrified. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

11:50.975 --> 11:52.800
<i> no amnesty for parasites. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

11:53.855 --> 11:57.506
John wants <i> McLaughling

13:30.624 --> 13:32.085
Thank you.

13:46.595 --> 13:48.805
Give me some tacos and a "cafe-ole"?

13:50.055 --> 13:52.073
Gringa, we have "cafe-ole".

13:52.362 --> 13:53.515
Coffee normal then

14:00.531 --> 14:02.164
No spit, please

14:06.970 --> 14:09.084
Why pretend to come here
just for a coffee?

14:09.943 --> 14:13.285
Do not pretend, in fact is
better and cheaper.

14:13.671 --> 14:15.593
Can I refuse to
meet anyone.

14:16.458 --> 14:17.515
It's the American way.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.278
Yes, for the citizens.

14:20.817 --> 14:21.970
You have your papers?

14:23.508 --> 14:25.046
Them to verify
last time

14:25.335 --> 14:28.986
Renewed on time.

14:30.332 --> 14:31.582
Has yours?

14:31.679 --> 14:33.312
Same as the last
since the verifier

14:34.850 --> 14:36.100
You think you are doing is right

14:36.197 --> 14:37.926
"Take your brothers and sisters,

14:38.408 --> 14:41.002
and deport them to a personal hell?

14:41.195 --> 14:42.348
It's the law.

14:42.926 --> 14:44.079
There are many laws.

14:44.272 --> 14:45.329
Yes

14:45.522 --> 14:49.269
immigration fraud,
illegal entry...

14:50.039 --> 14:53.594
food handling, but
I am sure that you know, right?

14:53.921 --> 14:55.690
You may give me my tacos?

15:00.426 --> 15:01.345
Who is "she"?

15:01.490 --> 15:04.227
I hear she runs a clandestine network.

15:04.816 --> 15:06.318
Let me tell you that I do not know.

15:06.607 --> 15:09.490
Just do tacos and seeing them
workers to this place

15:10.356 --> 15:12.949
They feel well-fed
with something more than hate.

15:13.815 --> 15:14.776
Funny.

15:14.873 --> 15:16.891
Sounds like something that "She" would say.

15:18.333 --> 15:19.486
we see

15:24.292 --> 15:25.348
<i> In the race for State Senate... &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

15:25.349 --> 15:29.481
<i> the latest research shows that
McLaughlin declined in voting intentions &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

15:29.482 --> 15:31.884
<i> due to its tough stance
on immigration. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

15:47.538 --> 15:48.633
Sobe

15:49.512 --> 15:51.419
$ 70 per day for gardening

15:52.573 --> 15:54.302
$ 100 for roofing.

15:54.303 --> 15:56.225
$ 125 for septic tanks.

15:58.470 --> 16:00.315
Has killed someone before?

16:40.018 --> 16:41.564
You know this guy?

16:45.443 --> 16:47.788
Sen. John McLaughlin.

16:48.232 --> 16:49.547
Independent pitos suck "in the district.

16:50.588 --> 16:53.143
He built his reputation being
hard with the 'back' Mojadas.

16:54.681 --> 16:55.642
His words.

16:56.511 --> 16:59.935
Yes, he will send to you and to all
his brothers back to Mexico.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.377
As a courtesy

17:02.316 --> 17:05.845
rather than build a
border wall without pay

17:06.039 --> 17:08.153
and then, thank you.
Get out

17:08.612 --> 17:10.877
But what the senator does not understand

17:10.974 --> 17:13.377
is that this state walk
based on the illegal.

17:13.377 --> 17:14.339
What drives.

17:14.339 --> 17:15.781
Keep costs low.

17:15.781 --> 17:17.511
Keeping the wheels in motion.

17:17.647 --> 17:19.730
They are fucked
so it continues

17:20.692 --> 17:21.653
My words.

17:23.688 --> 17:25.492
Now suppose that
you have no documents.

17:25.829 --> 17:27.310
Like it or not,

17:27.311 --> 17:31.348
illegal and you will be forced out
this country in large quantities.

17:32.983 --> 17:35.193
Making people suffer on both sides.

17:37.733 --> 17:39.271
The Senator Must Die

17:50.418 --> 17:54.031
So I will give you
$ 150,000 in cash.

18:06.583 --> 18:08.037
Can someone else

18:10.344 --> 18:11.426
No time.

18:12.150 --> 18:13.632
This work must be done
tomorrow.

18:19.783 --> 18:22.762
As you make this work would cost,
receive the money and disappear?

18:23.628 --> 18:25.838
How long would it take
to join this money?

18:26.511 --> 18:29.874
5, 10, 15 years... ?

18:31.413 --> 18:33.623
You can do many
good things with it.

18:34.392 --> 18:35.545
You deserve it.

18:41.430 --> 18:46.836
I do not do this thing, but
I can assure myself that something will happen if you do not.

18:48.375 --> 18:49.528
Are you in?

18:55.582 --> 18:57.408
Take a look at this.

18:57.409 --> 18:59.907
Sleek, laser sight...

19:01.157 --> 19:04.713
Can you give a shot in the penis of a
mosquito to 1000 meters.

19:06.252 --> 19:08.401
and let my nuts hang.

19:12.209 --> 19:13.189
Machete?

19:13.478 --> 19:15.111
It is good if you want to send
a brutal message...

19:15.112 --> 19:16.250
but for this purpose does not serve us
for our purposes.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.170
Support?
This is your backup.

19:20.270 --> 19:21.270
I

19:21.515 --> 19:23.437
Call me, or by message if
you have any problems or delays.

19:23.438 --> 19:25.263
I need you are in the terrace at 1:00.

19:32.278 --> 19:34.199
And shoot for the senator at 01:04.

20:25.068 --> 20:26.088
Arise

20:27.480 --> 20:28.722
Damn You, April

20:28.723 --> 20:31.125
My partners are very powerful
to handle this shit

20:37.275 --> 20:39.773
It is the second operation in less than
six months, I have to close

20:39.774 --> 20:40.735
because you're a junkie.

20:43.331 --> 20:44.580
I told you a thousand times

20:44.773 --> 20:46.406
If you need something, come
to me directly.

20:49.578 --> 20:51.404
Do not go to the lab.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.493
Got something to say to me?

21:06.184 --> 21:07.529
Sorry dad.

21:38.992 --> 21:39.996
What is this?

21:39.997 --> 21:41.823
$ 150,000 in cash.

21:43.650 --> 21:44.899
Are you crazy?

21:45.476 --> 21:48.167
La Red has helped me go through once. Use it.

21:49.129 --> 21:50.474
To help people.

21:51.243 --> 21:52.781
Do not know how you know what you know,

21:54.127 --> 21:55.664
but I'm glad to know.

22:00.374 --> 22:01.623
What do you want?

22:03.353 --> 22:04.314
Yes.

22:05.560 --> 22:09.022
<i> Ladies and Gentlemen,
Sen. John McLaughlin. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

22:13.216 --> 22:14.962
Thank you all for coming today.

22:15.155 --> 22:18.133
<i> I want to thank you for your support
the bottom of my heart... &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

22:23.453 --> 22:25.913
Because if we tested
tested with fire...

22:27.050 --> 22:30.523
<i> our borders are put to the test
Let me tell you, we speak of this test to the test. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

22:32.158 --> 22:34.560

the invaders, the outsiders &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

22:34.561 --> 22:37.443
<i> come to our land crossing
the border day and night. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

22:37.444 --> 22:38.982
Are parasites

22:38.983 --> 22:43.499
These suck-bloods are degrading
our cities, counties, states.

22:46.190 --> 22:47.920
Please understand. We are at war

22:47.921 --> 22:50.707
Every time an illegal
crossing our borders

22:50.708 --> 22:53.687
is an act of aggression against
sovereignty of our State

22:53.688 --> 22:55.321
is an act of terrorism

22:57.340 --> 23:00.127
In all sides people
talk about change...

23:00.224 --> 23:04.932
"Change what?" This is a great
state, but founded on freedom.

23:05.510 --> 23:07.047
Do not want to change that.

23:08.393 --> 23:13.870
Our citizens E. U. A.
They work hard to earn a salary.

23:15.889 --> 23:17.522
Do not want to change that.

23:18.004 --> 23:21.079
Changes, a lot of changes...

23:21.080 --> 23:25.211
Open the doors, "Red Rover, Red Rover
want the terrorists to come. "

23:26.558 --> 23:28.864
Let me say that will change...

23:29.057 --> 23:30.210
$ 68 cents.

23:31.556 --> 23:35.976
The coins in your pocket
because that is what the parasites

23:35.977 --> 23:37.600
take out your money.

23:37.899 --> 23:40.109
But that may change

23:43.032 --> 23:45.338
I want to say one more thing...

23:46.094 --> 23:47.727
We will win

24:02.670 --> 24:05.552
Ali is in the roof from there

24:07.411 --> 24:08.468
Put him in the car

24:16.032 --> 24:17.952
I'm heading

24:32.070 --> 24:33.127
Go ahead.

24:34.227 --> 24:36.363
Shoot, male...

24:36.556 --> 24:37.901
Is this what you want?

24:37.902 --> 24:38.863
The three of us

24:39.248 --> 24:40.785
You can not shoot a...

24:46.552 --> 24:48.069
Shit...

24:58.640 --> 25:01.522
Try, come on, motherfucker

25:02.964 --> 25:05.655
Spread your brain
everywhere.

25:11.133 --> 25:12.766
This is very fucked

25:12.767 --> 25:14.881
This type shot
on a representative

25:14.882 --> 25:15.843
No, the one senator.

25:15.844 --> 25:16.805
Are the same shit

25:16.806 --> 25:18.439
So if he dies, we got it

25:18.633 --> 25:19.689
Absolutely

25:19.690 --> 25:22.189
And we'll hang it
As to Saddam

25:23.151 --> 25:25.264
Look, I'll call the boss
to see what they want to do.

25:25.265 --> 25:26.226
Forward.

25:26.415 --> 25:29.009
We have the "passarito" on the way

25:30.451 --> 25:32.661
Bring him to the basement

25:34.646 --> 25:36.567
Still believe we're cops.

25:36.760 --> 25:37.913
Absolutely.

25:37.914 --> 25:41.758
Dressed as policemen,
we have a car, handcuffed...

25:41.759 --> 25:43.008
Equal to the real cops

25:45.123 --> 25:47.813
Not told
Absolutely

25:48.007 --> 25:49.993
Man, I tell you

25:50.570 --> 25:51.627
God

26:11.037 --> 26:12.190
<i> Bad news at the last minute. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

26:12.383 --> 26:16.611
<i> Senator McLaughlin was injured in a
leg by an unknown gunman. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

26:16.900 --> 26:19.155
He was immediately transported <i>
for the Park Lane Hospital, &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

26:19.156 --> 26:21.558
<i> where, according to reports its
condition is good and stable &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

26:21.847 --> 26:26.267
<i> a video shows the gunman
was a man of Mexican origin. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

26:27.229 --> 26:32.129
<i> Senator is against immigration and the
favor of a strict border control. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

26:41.450 --> 26:43.853
State Torrez
Mexico

26:52.502 --> 26:54.231
See what I ordered, Mr. Torrez.

26:54.424 --> 26:56.058
Put it on the screen now.

26:56.539 --> 26:57.980
This is gold for the campaign

27:00.287 --> 27:03.266
I hope my contribution
serve for his reelection.

27:03.267 --> 27:04.901
And not for retirement

27:04.902 --> 27:06.919
This will ensure that win

27:06.920 --> 27:08.650
and the next session

27:08.651 --> 27:10.957
run everything as we want

27:13.163 --> 27:14.316
Rewind

27:16.431 --> 27:17.776
Who is it?

27:18.162 --> 27:21.429
Nobody... I got him in
street. Nobody will miss him.

27:22.102 --> 27:23.351
Is he dead?

27:23.929 --> 27:25.755
Dead and dying on the roof...

27:25.756 --> 27:29.023
foderes to me, dead or dying?

27:30.273 --> 27:32.387
Will be dead in a
minutes, I guarantee.

27:40.554 --> 27:41.515
What?

27:43.245 --> 27:46.320
It's me, is dead.
I think it is blown.

27:46.513 --> 27:50.261
Think not. Checks, verifies the morgue
the hospital, any place

28:09.383 --> 28:10.403
Is he?

28:10.596 --> 28:12.037
Yes, the doctor will see you immediately.

28:12.615 --> 28:13.575
Quiet

28:15.690 --> 28:19.918
That's incredible. The bullet ricocheted into another
bullet that was there before all

28:20.111 --> 28:22.129
If they had not shot him before
would now be dead.

28:22.418 --> 28:23.860
Have someone who cares for you somewhere.

28:25.110 --> 28:26.936
I can feel your eyes on my uterus

28:26.971 --> 28:28.474
Not Lisa, in your colon

28:29.244 --> 28:33.279
Actually, you know that the intestines
measuring 10 times the height of the body?

28:33.472 --> 28:36.259
Wait, so the intestines
human measuring some 16 meters?

28:36.260 --> 28:37.221
So it is

28:38.951 --> 28:40.393
The hero is to be agreed

28:48.656 --> 28:50.106
Leave him alone.

28:52.697 --> 28:54.768
What can I do for you?

28:54.846 --> 28:57.993
What can it do for me? I'm looking for
a gentleman who just bring...

28:58.570 --> 29:02.510
probably to the emergency.
Where can I find it?

29:02.703 --> 29:05.394
Want to go to intensive care, right?

29:06.067 --> 29:09.334
Go left, then right,
left again, and will be there

29:12.218 --> 29:13.275
Are you sure?

29:18.272 --> 29:19.425
This way.

29:22.405 --> 29:23.366
Now go.

29:38.740 --> 29:39.893
Is there another way out of here?

29:39.894 --> 29:40.855
There are no more departures

29:42.105 --> 29:43.162
Do not you want to use it

29:43.451 --> 29:45.757
It is a "shell skulls. " Used to
separate meat from bones.

29:46.911 --> 29:48.449
Cut the flesh like butter.

29:53.638 --> 29:54.984
Hand me that tank.

30:54.463 --> 30:55.424
High

31:32.635 --> 31:34.205
The boss will not like this.

31:35.254 --> 31:36.904
What we say?

32:06.211 --> 32:07.364
<i> Where is the agent? &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

32:07.365 --> 32:08.326
I'm having lunch, sir.

32:08.327 --> 32:09.961
<i> The meal ended.
It was all to hell. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

32:09.962 --> 32:12.172
<i> Someone shot at Senator McLaughlin. &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

32:12.173 --> 32:13.134
<i> was an illegal. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

32:13.519 --> 32:14.480
I'm seeing now.

32:14.481 --> 32:19.189
<i> This video was made out of
hospital, where he led the senator. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

32:19.190 --> 32:22.073
<i> Authorities believe that the
suspect is extremely dangerous. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

32:22.074 --> 32:23.034
Son of a bitch

32:23.035 --> 32:23.996
What?

32:23.997 --> 32:24.958
Not you, sir.

32:25.920 --> 32:27.169
I've seen him before.

32:27.170 --> 32:28.131
Here comes Rivera

32:28.132 --> 32:29.573
Yes, sir. I'm going

32:29.574 --> 32:31.016
<i>... maybe this is the country illegally &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

32:31.208 --> 32:34.763
<i>... authorities consider him armed
and extremely dangerous. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

32:40.817 --> 32:44.313
Are you on TV cabron
C'mon. Fast.

32:47.101 --> 32:51.905
The shooting of the Senator McLaughlin
perhaps what his campaign needed

32:51.906 --> 32:56.710
Research indicates that
leads in the polls.

32:57.384 --> 33:01.611
Since the shooting support
border control has risen

33:06.320 --> 33:09.203
Yes, you do not cross the border Jack?

33:22.869 --> 33:25.586
I have no other option,
Of course I believe in you

33:26.395 --> 33:28.013
Yes but why me
would you give the money?

33:28.914 --> 33:30.460
Seek your fucking ass

33:33.110 --> 33:34.494
Here you will be safe

33:36.729 --> 33:38.331
Try not to bleed on the bed.

34:02.153 --> 34:04.225
You are the "She"?

34:05.943 --> 34:08.077
You think I am "She"?
operate from a truck tacos?

34:09.303 --> 34:12.592
"She" brings hope.
It is the right front of the incorrect

34:13.965 --> 34:17.245
Unfortunately, it is a myth.

34:17.246 --> 34:20.225
Someone who invented
to lead La Red

34:21.643 --> 34:23.804
At first, I wanted to help
people arriving

34:24.936 --> 34:26.842
Feed them, find them work

34:27.583 --> 34:29.507
Now there's a war
against our own.

34:29.681 --> 34:33.023
Van and his "Vigilantes" of the border
They hunt us like dogs...

34:34.221 --> 34:36.742
No way to stop them.
You may

34:38.864 --> 34:40.225
You're a fighter

34:40.871 --> 34:44.074
Only when there is something
by fighting.

34:46.034 --> 34:47.036
Are you there?

34:50.346 --> 34:51.366
Always.

35:02.032 --> 35:04.608
When dawn, you should be fine

35:06.324 --> 35:08.758
Do not start something
that you can not finish.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.113
You know me?

35:14.526 --> 35:15.526
I know the legend.

35:16.984 --> 35:18.856
Perhaps the legend is better.

35:25.025 --> 35:26.227
I hope so.

35:42.172 --> 35:43.823
Where are you mysterious?

36:10.948 --> 36:11.930
My God...

36:15.102 --> 36:16.062
Codename: Machete
Former Federal.

36:17.566 --> 36:21.060
What happened with the
Senator, this is crazy, huh?

36:21.266 --> 36:24.657
Sometimes I wonder, April
world in which we live.

36:25.979 --> 36:27.506
In a very screwed.

36:28.140 --> 36:29.969
Let me wash your mouth out with soap.

36:30.103 --> 36:31.598
Give me another bat.

36:31.707 --> 36:33.843
Someone shot a senator.
How to Draw a world?

36:33.940 --> 36:34.901
A world of shit.

36:36.158 --> 36:37.887
They are cut from the same bowl

36:38.410 --> 36:42.321
I think David is going to ask me
to marry him.

36:44.209 --> 36:45.873
But I have my priorities.

36:46.042 --> 36:47.972
The school and a career.

36:48.071 --> 36:51.175
Actually thinking about modeling.

36:52.229 --> 36:56.872
You are a very pretty girl April,
but it is something "hard. "

36:57.007 --> 36:59.361
I know all about the "hardness".

37:03.185 --> 37:05.245
You know how many have visited my site?

37:05.803 --> 37:07.932
Got Web Site? You
site? Did you know that?

37:07.966 --> 37:13.556
I know what the public wants,
and I want to me, everything about me.

37:16.822 --> 37:19.332
This is absurd,
I will send you to a convent...

37:20.357 --> 37:21.071
What?

37:21.241 --> 37:23.429
Is lost. He escaped

37:23.501 --> 37:29.188
Damn, you can not kill a single
Dealer. Find him and kill him

37:41.124 --> 37:42.170
Have you seen the car?

37:46.706 --> 37:48.569
Do you speak. 45?

37:49.324 --> 37:51.187
Where is the truck of tacos?

37:52.957 --> 37:56.684
I do not know man, not seen
this morning, is delayed.

37:57.343 --> 37:58.972
She...

38:02.653 --> 38:03.684
You know where you live?

38:53.602 --> 38:54.778
Well, it's there.

40:07.955 --> 40:09.592
Are you on all channels
in the fucking TV

40:10.348 --> 40:11.682
Join

40:12.934 --> 40:13.988
Agent

40:17.160 --> 40:19.562
You're the second fine
girl who drives me today.

40:25.435 --> 40:28.408
Homes that explode... .
Bodies that fall from the sky?

40:28.807 --> 40:29.862
God. Machete.

40:30.055 --> 40:31.592
It is a psycho bitch

40:32.746 --> 40:34.284
Be who you are...

40:36.703 --> 40:38.360
Immigration Agency.

40:39.030 --> 40:42.264
ICE.
The damn ICE, "immigration. "

40:42.265 --> 40:45.244
Do not worry, I will deliver thee
If you tell me what I need to know.

40:45.533 --> 40:46.878
Advance my career.

40:46.879 --> 40:49.954
I can not continue to hold
people in positions of tacos

40:49.955 --> 40:51.685
Probably
half were related.

40:51.686 --> 40:53.415
You need me more than I do for you

40:54.115 --> 40:58.366
Come on. You know that the police will catch you
for trying to kill the senator.

40:59.156 --> 41:00.655
Would not kill him.

41:01.520 --> 41:05.460
la shoot for the neck,
to stop saying these stupid

41:05.653 --> 41:09.016
He was ready, but
there was another shooter.

41:09.017 --> 41:11.227
There was another shooter? Who?

41:20.683 --> 41:21.673
Leads

41:24.268 --> 41:25.229
Leads

41:31.384 --> 41:33.735
I know what they did to his family.

41:33.907 --> 41:37.312
And if you do not trust
anyone, but here is different.

41:37.417 --> 41:38.969
Laws are enforced.

41:39.136 --> 41:42.207
And people control
not the drug barons.

41:43.686 --> 41:45.696
Here works.

41:45.697 --> 41:46.697
That you say

41:46.827 --> 41:50.289
I started working on a shift
pulling garbage night

41:50.456 --> 41:51.831
But follow my path...

41:52.416 --> 41:54.527
Translator, assistant...

41:55.915 --> 41:58.340
Now I'm the special agent
charge of investigations.

41:58.864 --> 42:01.702
It seems that you still
comes to take out the trash

42:02.277 --> 42:03.805
Let me give you...

42:04.339 --> 42:07.340
They put you in the program
protection of witnesses.

42:07.341 --> 42:10.224
You just have to tell me who you
hired to kill the senator.

42:17.855 --> 42:18.890
Well

42:21.871 --> 42:23.429
Shit...

42:24.872 --> 42:29.195
I say that the worker
Mexico is a federal damn?

42:29.384 --> 42:33.536
So is the CIA, FBI, DEA, all
mixed in a fucking burrito.

42:33.650 --> 42:36.042
<i> Is this the man who
hast killed the Machete &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

42:37.161 --> 42:38.206
Yes.

42:38.816 --> 42:41.901
<i> And so far, no. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

42:42.863 --> 42:43.824
Until now.

42:44.535 --> 42:48.173
<i> regret that tolerates it. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

42:48.462 --> 42:49.711
I do not

43:02.529 --> 43:03.449
not bad

43:03.642 --> 43:06.717
<i> The last time we talked I did not mention
it was a federal curse &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

43:06.718 --> 43:10.561
<i> Cortes is a hard guy to kill,
Believe me, I tried. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

43:11.235 --> 43:12.964
Why not deal with
the kind that called?

43:14.791 --> 43:16.117
<i> is the best that Texas offers. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

43:18.020 --> 43:21.189
Osiris Amanpour.

43:21.554 --> 43:26.330
Machete is still alive, can
expose my whole operation

43:27.652 --> 43:33.129
You have 24 hours to kill
or I'll kill him myself

43:41.094 --> 43:43.806
Sorry, my friend.

43:46.270 --> 43:49.877
My grandfather thought he could
solve any problem with the food.

43:49.911 --> 43:54.115
And you my friend, you must
many problems.

43:56.482 --> 44:00.566
Who you working for?
Whoever killed the Senator?

44:00.772 --> 44:03.190
Is La Red? Light?

44:03.462 --> 44:08.545
A no. It was not La Red
Came a kind

44:08.642 --> 44:09.988
was not a Mexican.

44:10.021 --> 44:10.949
Really?

44:12.081 --> 44:16.917
Pick someone randomly and say:
Want to assassinate a Senator today?

44:17.052 --> 44:18.087
Yes?

44:18.223 --> 44:21.326
I thought it was a job offer.

44:21.496 --> 44:24.889
Instead, it offered me $ 150,000
to kill the senator.

44:25.352 --> 44:26.495
For money?

44:27.246 --> 44:28.495
Why did you?

44:30.514 --> 44:31.667
For money?

44:33.180 --> 44:38.845
Look, you Machete
illegal in this country.

44:39.417 --> 44:42.535
And after what happened in Mexico
there is no way back home.

44:43.541 --> 44:45.422
Basically, you're a man without country.

44:50.273 --> 44:51.234
Look at me.

44:52.772 --> 44:54.117
Can I get you documents.

44:55.378 --> 44:57.465
They told you how to enter?

45:06.375 --> 45:08.724
Find the guy who did it.

45:10.106 --> 45:11.845
And bring

45:12.496 --> 45:14.253
Why should I trust you?

45:22.251 --> 45:24.047
Because we are both policemen.

45:27.060 --> 45:29.973
I tried to stop you, but
the gun had no bullets.

45:45.261 --> 45:47.363
I do not think that would fall well
so easy, Really?

45:48.894 --> 45:51.338
You're alive. Your home!

45:51.480 --> 45:53.309
It was small...

45:54.641 --> 45:55.911
I have something to show you, come...

46:08.378 --> 46:10.167
Told them that we sell.

46:11.544 --> 46:12.882
Who knows what will
do after

46:13.508 --> 46:15.405
Shit, Light

46:15.635 --> 46:18.280
You have more weapons than the police

46:18.549 --> 46:21.151
It's a good start, we need more.

46:21.288 --> 46:22.388
Need? Why?

46:25.128 --> 46:27.181
Van and his men
They come to us

46:27.354 --> 46:28.793
We must be ready

46:28.859 --> 46:30.756
Will not be here forever.

46:30.888 --> 46:34.649
If anything happens, tell Machete
the people who need it.

46:34.816 --> 46:36.612
Machete Who is this exactly?

46:38.842 --> 46:40.605
he is... .

46:41.952 --> 46:43.157
It is the chosen one...

46:43.360 --> 46:46.238
Hands up. Against the wall.

46:46.796 --> 46:48.392
All, to move

46:52.753 --> 46:54.025
Where's Machete?

46:54.291 --> 46:57.918
Shit. She knows
The "migration" will deport us.

46:58.023 --> 47:02.141
Nobody is going to deport. Machete told me that
La Red that is not involved in the shooting.

47:02.345 --> 47:07.344
Although... You should perhaps
check "las carnitas"...

47:07.745 --> 47:10.657
What is this place?

47:18.447 --> 47:20.533
Welcome to La Red

47:21.572 --> 47:23.091
These are the people who help us.

47:23.618 --> 47:28.484
The cross, the work
Each one does his part

47:28.980 --> 47:30.884
And this?

47:30.918 --> 47:33.632
These are the types
we must stop them

47:33.633 --> 47:36.611
Van Jackson and his Border Vigilantes.

47:36.813 --> 47:40.198
They started with a pair of shotguns
and a perverse sense of justice.

47:40.809 --> 47:44.501
But last year increased:
more weapons, more men.

47:44.790 --> 47:45.943
Who finances them?

47:46.596 --> 47:48.715
Who is planning a
massive operation.

47:49.335 --> 47:50.785
And this?

47:51.702 --> 47:55.004
Missing

47:55.139 --> 47:58.268
It is assumed that they had to cross,
but can not control them.

47:58.756 --> 48:01.814
How deep will this operation?
Too deep

48:01.947 --> 48:06.741
All religions, all races.
Lawyers, priests, doctors, friends...

48:06.742 --> 48:07.805
So call it La Network

48:09.665 --> 48:12.648
We see how everyone
risk everything to come here.

48:14.287 --> 48:15.735
But the system does not work.

48:16.505 --> 48:17.466
Is broken.

48:18.600 --> 48:20.371
So we created our

48:23.011 --> 48:25.860
You gonna give us?
Are you going to sell us?

48:26.264 --> 48:27.387
not...

48:28.805 --> 48:31.923
Pretend
I have not seen anything like this.

48:32.405 --> 48:34.038
Machete says that seeking

48:47.738 --> 48:50.806
I am a man of faith,
I made a vow of peace.

48:51.096 --> 48:52.441
No shutter

48:52.867 --> 48:54.257
Neither shoot less than before.

48:54.681 --> 48:57.742
I have not seen or heard
thee to three years,

48:58.031 --> 49:00.625
And now you want to help you out
to kill all these men?

49:01.845 --> 49:03.674
Yes, brother...

49:04.444 --> 49:06.078
I mean, Father.

49:10.095 --> 49:12.029
I'll see what I can do.

49:14.144 --> 49:17.219
Want you to pray 10 Our Fathers
and 10 Hail Marys.

49:17.752 --> 49:20.165
The candlelight
are for the mother. .

49:22.184 --> 49:24.586
For funeral
business is a guaranteed

49:28.337 --> 49:32.050
I installed it when the
Things began to disappear from the altar.

49:32.051 --> 49:35.222
Imagine if we could
have something like the feds.

49:35.424 --> 49:38.324
This is how you get children
bad now, you catch on video.

49:39.456 --> 49:41.185
A Cuban?

49:42.159 --> 49:43.213
Mexican

49:44.103 --> 49:45.507
Yes, I also have

49:51.087 --> 49:52.272
There's something I want you to see

49:52.273 --> 49:54.771
I'm sure <i>
they will take. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

49:55.457 --> 49:58.787
<i> is the first strike
a war we did not ask. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

49:59.565 --> 50:01.025
It's good to have your
brother in the city.

50:02.631 --> 50:03.630
There

50:05.620 --> 50:06.666
This type hired me.

50:06.867 --> 50:07.920
Michael Booth?

50:09.147 --> 50:11.213
It is the right hand
McLaughlin.

50:13.467 --> 50:14.487
You know him?

50:14.809 --> 50:17.912
Yes. . Come to confession
all the time.

50:18.052 --> 50:20.543
Many impure thoughts.

50:20.544 --> 50:22.465
Mainly related
with his daughter.

50:23.541 --> 50:25.170
I guess I'm more
cheaper than a psychiatrist.

50:26.426 --> 50:27.387
This is the file.

50:27.621 --> 50:29.952
When you start talking about
its relation to cartels

50:29.953 --> 50:31.302
I think that might be useful.

50:31.335 --> 50:33.958
I bet McLaughlin
not even know that most

50:33.959 --> 50:36.458
Booth's business are only
fronts for drug trafficking.

50:37.294 --> 50:41.061
What I do not understand is why
hired you to kill your boss.

50:41.325 --> 50:42.286
I do not know.

50:43.576 --> 50:44.561
I'll find out.

50:44.797 --> 50:46.652
Not sure that you are here.

50:47.463 --> 50:48.437
Not looking for safety.

50:48.737 --> 50:50.383
I mean it is not safe
to me that you are here

50:50.384 --> 50:52.498
Absolve all your sins,
Now, go to hell

50:53.555 --> 50:54.516
Well, brother...

50:56.958 --> 50:58.278
But I'll take <i>
borrow your car. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

51:11.635 --> 51:15.191
Complained about the weakness of the neck,
You said shit of abdominal work.

51:17.171 --> 51:18.696
Head... Who is it?

51:20.958 --> 51:22.419
The new gardener

51:23.353 --> 51:24.553
The gardener?

51:34.609 --> 51:36.356
I'm just kidding with you, sir.

51:36.357 --> 51:38.855
It's Hungarian, it means
that'll kill you, monkey.

51:38.856 --> 51:43.084
You know what? There is a large pile
shit back. Go and clean, ok?

51:43.373 --> 51:44.814
Be sure to do a good job.

51:47.122 --> 51:48.947
And be sure to clean
well your boots.

51:49.332 --> 51:50.774
They charge that shit into the house.

51:51.832 --> 51:53.946
Are you noticing that you let go
Mexicans in your house

51:53.947 --> 51:55.580
only because they have
garden tools?

51:55.581 --> 51:57.311
I mean, let
no questions asked

52:00.020 --> 52:01.510
Could have a chainsaw
or a machete...

52:06.034 --> 52:07.031
God. Curse

52:21.733 --> 52:22.598
Stops

52:26.154 --> 52:27.115
Damn, that hurts

52:42.656 --> 52:44.679
If your father ever see this

52:44.968 --> 52:47.563
Mom, everyone will see
this on the Internet.

52:48.595 --> 52:51.202
Let's put online.

52:55.750 --> 52:57.220
You're not the same kind of always

52:58.185 --> 52:59.502
Ok for me.

53:00.849 --> 53:02.386
Do not be shy, go

53:41.865 --> 53:42.844
<i> Access denied. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

53:57.438 --> 54:00.971
What the fuck... Because what brought you here?
Heard nothing about what I said

54:01.760 --> 54:03.636
Can I get rid of them?
What? No... not,

54:03.839 --> 54:07.837
The Church can always
make good use of good people.

54:19.564 --> 54:20.552
June?

54:22.248 --> 54:23.274
April?

54:55.393 --> 54:57.155
Where is my wife and daughter?

54:57.389 --> 54:59.084
The family at a time.

54:59.318 --> 55:02.378
I am Osiris... Machete has
a brother. .

55:04.013 --> 55:06.895
or should I say, Father.

55:08.668 --> 55:12.961
<i> Sen. John McLaughlin swore
defend the Constitution of this State. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

55:13.098 --> 55:17.741
<i> Now, is shot by us... &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

55:22.135 --> 55:23.998
And this is the bullet.

55:24.261 --> 55:26.806
Vote to reelect <i>
Sen. John McLauhling. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

55:27.204 --> 55:29.679
I'm John McLaughlin
and I approve this message.

55:29.815 --> 55:32.795
<i> paid by the Committee
reelection of John McLaughlin. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

55:54.704 --> 55:59.381
Sorry lady, my new phone.
You should be vibrating.

56:01.041 --> 56:02.023
Posdemos help me with this?

56:03.408 --> 56:04.390
<i> Prévert. &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

56:08.155 --> 56:09.159
Yes?

56:09.160 --> 56:12.043
Senator? It's Van.

56:12.408 --> 56:15.428
I heard you have a problem
that can be corrected.

56:15.579 --> 56:17.982
Do not call me again
In this issue, I call you

56:18.155 --> 56:21.091
But did you say to Senator
that the war had begun

56:21.092 --> 56:22.053
Helter Skelter is here.

56:22.919 --> 56:25.417
His army waiting for order.

56:25.536 --> 56:28.507
Gotta take care of my reputation,
for now. Without cagadas

56:30.325 --> 56:33.112
What about the shooter?
Still around

56:36.799 --> 56:41.475
Nothing would please me more, see you dance
bolero with a rope around his neck.

56:41.846 --> 56:44.330
I am sure now
underground

56:44.331 --> 56:47.118
I say to go to
illegally arresting him

56:47.823 --> 56:49.960
Find La Red and
find the shooter.

56:49.995 --> 56:53.839
Turn to our special friend, and you say you
we need more weapons

56:54.239 --> 56:57.641
If you want the border
Closed seriously

56:57.738 --> 56:59.372
Grab your gun.

56:59.373 --> 57:00.334
Thank you.

57:03.731 --> 57:06.175
Our friend is online.

57:18.002 --> 57:19.732
Where the hell have you been?

57:20.588 --> 57:22.876
At least you could
send me a message.

57:23.894 --> 57:26.115
Machete not send messages

57:29.392 --> 57:31.256
But can Machete evidence.

57:37.340 --> 57:39.495
Thanks for returning

57:40.686 --> 57:45.101
<i> There is no way that McLaughlin
is elected, unless something big happens. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

57:45.267 --> 57:48.654
<i> you imagine if someone shoots the senator,
and that someone turns out to be the Mexican &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

57:48.655 --> 57:50.577
<i> not want to see
elected as President &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

57:50.578 --> 57:54.228
<i> is not a sin if someone shoots
the loss of Senator, right? &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

57:54.229 --> 57:57.528
So, here is a recording
with confession of your brother?

57:57.561 --> 58:00.322
<i> If not command to kill the man
is not a sin, it is Father? &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

58:00.356 --> 58:04.898
These files here, in
Booth's office, are encrypted

58:07.297 --> 58:09.295
<i> up my little Abpril...
whereas the nights... &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

58:13.851 --> 58:14.521
Denying

58:15.064 --> 58:17.150
Do not you think so
will be easy, right?

58:18.920 --> 58:22.278
<i> Want to come April
more like a real man. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

58:33.810 --> 58:34.770
Shit...

58:35.402 --> 58:40.535
You're right, La Red do not hide it
this is something much bigger.

58:40.999 --> 58:45.285
You can knock all
Senator, Booth...

58:47.208 --> 58:48.169
Van...

58:50.622 --> 58:54.350
Look, there's money Mexican drug
funding their campaign.

58:57.627 --> 58:59.647
Rogelio Torrez.

59:04.371 --> 59:07.660
It's a mafia that has tratano of
take control of drug routes.

59:08.829 --> 59:11.777
this should be near the border fence
McLaughlin wants to build.

59:15.335 --> 59:18.357
You see that? These brands
show weaknesses

59:19.319 --> 59:21.240
Now it all makes sense.

59:21.241 --> 59:22.202
Torrez paid campaign
Senator. McLaughlin

59:23.290 --> 59:26.657
If you pay for it is
can control the wall

59:28.126 --> 59:32.190
Good work Machete.
You're a great cop

59:32.903 --> 59:34.081
Too bad.

59:34.351 --> 59:35.379
And modest too.

59:36.573 --> 59:37.540
I'll...

59:45.042 --> 59:47.484
Arise
Why?

59:48.701 --> 59:49.710
Because you're drunk.

59:55.249 --> 59:57.503
<i> Come with me. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:25.126
Depends on the question

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:29.752
We know that Mexican hide
who tried to kill our senator.

01:00:30.906 --> 01:00:32.443
This is La Red, right?

01:00:33.694 --> 01:00:35.327
You are behind everything.

01:00:36.097 --> 01:00:37.250
We do not work that way.

01:00:38.884 --> 01:00:40.133
But if they want war...

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:42.440
I will give

01:00:47.937 --> 01:00:49.437
What do you think an eye for an eye?

01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:57.286
You burned your last burrito.

01:01:01.776 --> 01:01:03.075
You have to be better
it, Billy.

01:02:04.199 --> 01:02:05.602
Please, Father, have mercy.

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:09.351
God have mercy, I do not

01:03:16.726 --> 01:03:18.062
Hello Father

01:03:27.788 --> 01:03:31.238
The Blood of Christ?
I know more than Merlot.

01:03:33.278 --> 01:03:35.365
Where is it?

01:03:35.864 --> 01:03:37.694
On all sides

01:03:39.268 --> 01:03:40.673
Father Speaks

01:03:41.199 --> 01:03:44.680
Sing me one of these hymns Mexican
like when I was monaguilho

01:03:44.777 --> 01:03:46.219
Go to hell.

01:03:59.038 --> 01:04:02.274
Want to be a martyr?
I am good at making them.

01:04:03.391 --> 01:04:04.630
As Senator McLaughlin?

01:04:04.727 --> 01:04:05.898
So yes

01:04:06.412 --> 01:04:09.085
We will be re-elected Senator and
built around the border

01:04:09.086 --> 01:04:11.007
before it is too late.

01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:14.160
Really hate us so much?

01:04:14.258 --> 01:04:18.376
No priest, I hate
profits are low.

01:04:18.545 --> 01:04:21.448
An open border allows a flow
easily supply

01:04:21.449 --> 01:04:22.794
declining prices.

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:27.768
The border security, we limit
supplies, raise prices.

01:04:28.071 --> 01:04:30.883
Higher price, higher profits.

01:04:31.148 --> 01:04:34.943
You are blinded by power, including even
an attack against his own boss

01:04:37.334 --> 01:04:39.265
only to improve
numbers of elections.

01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:43.319
Last chance, buddy.

01:04:43.978 --> 01:04:46.590
Where's Machete
My wife and daughter?

01:04:50.328 --> 01:04:52.192
What the hell?

01:04:55.974 --> 01:04:57.446
Salute then.

01:05:23.771 --> 01:05:26.515
A true gentleman.

01:05:41.861 --> 01:05:42.847
Comfortable...

01:06:48.414 --> 01:06:50.077
Are they the same?

01:06:50.312 --> 01:06:52.500
So you want to see
dead also

01:06:53.454 --> 01:06:54.894
My brother.

01:06:56.072 --> 01:06:57.277
Waiting

01:07:28.078 --> 01:07:29.620
As you send messages with this thing?

01:07:35.365 --> 01:07:36.453
Machete not think it gets the message.

01:07:40.761 --> 01:07:42.102
Machete improvises

01:07:48.124 --> 01:07:49.371
Where you going?

01:07:50.837 --> 01:07:52.282
Empty trash

01:08:13.544 --> 01:08:15.039
Machete, sent a message.

01:08:15.213 --> 01:08:16.776
What say?

01:08:17.734 --> 01:08:21.917
Just fuck
the wrong Mexican

01:08:23.330 --> 01:08:24.702
Is behind us.

01:08:24.966 --> 01:08:27.879
No, he comes after you

01:08:30.792 --> 01:08:32.287
<i> Got news? &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:33.319
Yes. .

01:08:34.715 --> 01:08:35.979
Your brother is dead.

01:08:35.979 --> 01:08:39.727
You killed a priest,
congratulations.

01:08:42.233 --> 01:08:46.327
Thus Booth, I'm in your city.
And I will kill Machete

01:08:46.361 --> 01:08:47.654
And you will see how it goes

01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:50.515
And you will be the last you see

01:08:50.816 --> 01:08:52.020
Waiting

01:08:52.158 --> 01:08:53.986
There's a girl in ICE

01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:59.089
Is with Machete and has evidence against
me against you, against McLaughlin, everyone.

01:08:59.325 --> 01:09:02.629
You can do things
very difficult for us.

01:09:02.763 --> 01:09:04.626
Where is <i> &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:09:04.661 --> 01:09:07.339
You know, I thought...

01:09:07.509 --> 01:09:12.152
We let these people in our homes between
take care of our children,

01:09:12.287 --> 01:09:14.642
park our cars...

01:09:14.742 --> 01:09:17.063
But do not let enter the country.

01:09:17.165 --> 01:09:18.926
It makes sense to you?

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.399
You remember that one
I did it on the head.

01:09:22.566 --> 01:09:24.551
And also gave me a shot in the leg.

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.913
I thought the Jango
had shot

01:09:27.049 --> 01:09:28.645
I do not want to hear this story.

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:29.761
Think about it.

01:09:29.795 --> 01:09:32.932
He was not here for us
been here by the head.

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:36.272
But looking at the head, this
type is a real mouse.

01:09:38.374 --> 01:09:40.220
You better shut up yourself
Where is your loyalty?

01:09:48.707 --> 01:09:50.304
Did you hear that?

01:09:52.408 --> 01:09:53.747
It's the machine.

01:09:54.011 --> 01:09:56.131
He's back. Divide into.

01:10:15.548 --> 01:10:17.870
Alfa unit, you hear?

01:10:21.342 --> 01:10:22.747
Skirt!

01:10:27.626 --> 01:10:29.779
Can anybody hear me?

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:31.650
Anyone?

01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.517
Booth Where are you?

01:10:40.751 --> 01:10:45.985
With the senator, have
GPS. Ratreie his limousine.

01:10:47.264 --> 01:10:49.486
Do not kill me, please, take it.

01:10:55.644 --> 01:10:59.896
In Spanish, "I leave you vivir. "

01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:02.900
Thanks Chief

01:11:05.297 --> 01:11:06.900
<i> Let me get this right. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:11:07.018 --> 01:11:10.669
<i> One of the most prominent business men
Watchers of Texas &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

stricter laws on immigration &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:21.299
I know how that sounds, but I have to Booth
a video to commit a murder

01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.222
I have a lot of confessions.

01:11:23.677 --> 01:11:29.340
<i>. Listen, this man is an immigrant
illegal, an illegal immigrant is against the law. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:11:29.373 --> 01:11:32.458
For it is the law and what is right

01:11:37.437 --> 01:11:38.719
I will do what is right

<i> coincides with the man they were looking
about the shooting of Senator McLaughlin. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:12:09.111 --> 01:12:12.090
Ladies, ladies, please close the
doors. Give us a break.

01:12:12.091 --> 01:12:13.821
<i> On the street, call him Machete. &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:12:13.822 --> 01:12:18.049
<i> Who wants to be caught... &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:19.893
What the hell have you doing?

01:12:19.998 --> 01:12:21.629
This type is burning
the city to the ground.

01:12:21.630 --> 01:12:22.590
If we have a war
I wonder if I can win.

01:12:22.977 --> 01:12:25.096
You are a cheap, later
or earlier, to crush it.

01:12:25.202 --> 01:12:28.729
This is cheap AK-47s and fode
everything that appears in your path.

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.022
I'll handle it.

01:12:31.192 --> 01:12:33.205
I have a conference
in a few minutes

01:12:33.206 --> 01:12:35.801
I can not go out like a fucking
piñata waiting to give me.

01:12:38.034 --> 01:12:40.946
It's show time.

01:12:45.751 --> 01:12:46.712
Forgot your stick, sir.

01:12:50.046 --> 01:12:55.145
Ladies and gentlemen,
Senator McLaughlin

01:13:05.354 --> 01:13:08.510
This "thug" not
escape justice.

01:13:08.583 --> 01:13:12.411
I recommend this criminal and
that protect you, surrender.

01:13:12.643 --> 01:13:16.847
They destroy us from
in like a plague that is

01:13:18.468 --> 01:13:21.347
We can not let
terrorism win

01:13:21.705 --> 01:13:25.052
Senator, there are reports
involving his aides

01:13:25.053 --> 01:13:27.936
as head of the organization
the attack.

01:13:28.201 --> 01:13:30.879
Have a comment?

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:32.860
What... ?

01:13:37.257 --> 01:13:39.121
<i> want to be a martyr?
I am good at making them. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:13:39.253 --> 01:13:41.016
<i> As Senator McLaughlin &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:13:41.152 --> 01:13:44.254
<i> So we re-elected Senator and
this fence will be built at the border &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:13:44.255 --> 01:13:46.177
<i> before it is too late. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:13:47.063 --> 01:13:50.092
Or want to comment
about the murder...

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:52.110
border
on the night of July 22?

01:13:53.543 --> 01:13:56.000
<i> - Who will stop us?
Tu. &lt;/ I&gt;</i>

01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:58.700
<i> Welcome to the E. U. A. &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:14:01.399 --> 01:14:07.096
<i> You got? Do me a DVD.
My partners will enjoy a lot. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:12.589
What are their connections with
Rogelio Torrez the drug dealer?

01:14:12.724 --> 01:14:14.387
No comments.

01:14:18.981 --> 01:14:20.140
I think I have a heart attack.

01:14:20.568 --> 01:14:22.987
Hell, if not relax, have a

01:14:32.581 --> 01:14:36.074
Was playing with my career
and will now behind me

01:14:36.409 --> 01:14:37.438
You could have killed me.

01:14:37.535 --> 01:14:38.880
Not with that look.

01:14:39.481 --> 01:14:41.405
Fucking bastard...

01:14:41.712 --> 01:14:43.934
Supposes that calmed me?

01:14:44.298 --> 01:14:46.028
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:14:46.197 --> 01:14:49.366
I who financed the campaign.

01:14:49.535 --> 01:14:51.131
He who gives political power.

01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:52.342
Your Jesus

01:14:52.448 --> 01:14:54.647
So, you better fuck
knees and Rezes for your soul

01:14:54.648 --> 01:14:56.570
I am the only one who can
help you this time.

01:15:07.309 --> 01:15:09.363
Get out

01:15:39.515 --> 01:15:42.311
Damn, why do not you die?

01:15:43.753 --> 01:15:44.714
It can work

01:15:44.715 --> 01:15:45.676
We could have been rich.

01:15:46.638 --> 01:15:49.809
Torres wanted to move
your shit to the other side of the border

01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:53.653
tired of "los pendejo"
so we had a dream:

01:15:53.654 --> 01:15:57.306
Armed his men.

01:15:57.307 --> 01:15:58.267
Los Vigilantes.

01:15:58.469 --> 01:16:00.761
Our own private patrol
border

01:16:01.277 --> 01:16:03.981
But for Torres was not enough.

01:16:04.216 --> 01:16:06.957
Thinks, why do not the politicians
forming, which weapons can not

01:16:06.958 --> 01:16:11.378
The funny thing is that I thought
it would be a peaceful solution.

01:16:11.715 --> 01:16:13.179
Not like torture now.

01:16:15.511 --> 01:16:18.584
Please wait... Torrez is looking for you.

01:16:18.819 --> 01:16:20.688
Meet the senator,
find Torrez.

01:16:21.305 --> 01:16:22.551
Please...

01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:26.363
Tell me, my wife and daughter...

01:16:29.292 --> 01:16:30.271
With God.

01:16:31.233 --> 01:16:32.482
I suppose you will not see again

01:16:47.504 --> 01:16:49.133
Shit, my head...

01:16:51.530 --> 01:16:53.226
Where the hell are we?

01:16:54.018 --> 01:16:56.338
I think we drugged
Where are our clothes?

01:16:57.389 --> 01:16:59.375
Called the father

01:17:12.641 --> 01:17:14.862
I'm June, and April

01:17:16.111 --> 01:17:20.098
<i> Sorry, Madam
her husband is dead. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:17:20.956 --> 01:17:22.002
What?

01:17:22.684 --> 01:17:23.901
Senator killed him.

01:17:46.194 --> 01:17:49.653
The leader of the Vigilante, Van
Jackson declined to comment

01:17:49.846 --> 01:17:52.152
About his connection with
Mexican drug cartels.

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:53.595
Habla Van...

01:17:53.823 --> 01:17:54.796
I'm coming.

01:17:54.797 --> 01:17:56.238
We are all in the news senator.

01:17:56.831 --> 01:17:59.279
You are all committed
worked for us.

01:17:59.546 --> 01:18:01.851
There is only one way out
the curtain of smoke and go out

01:18:01.852 --> 01:18:04.158
But first I want to kill
this type, myself

01:18:04.620 --> 01:18:06.840
How to do now?

01:18:06.976 --> 01:18:09.419
I meet with you and your children
for one last ride.

01:18:27.584 --> 01:18:29.214
Where is the Light?

01:18:31.218 --> 01:18:32.746
She's dead, man.

01:18:33.116 --> 01:18:36.117
Watchers caught the
and now they are behind you

01:18:36.913 --> 01:18:39.000
You have to lead us in the fight!
Light was what I wanted.

01:18:39.171 --> 01:18:40.700
Not your war.

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:43.062
Perhaps adopt
No kidding.

01:18:43.557 --> 01:18:47.932
What is happening is not right
We want to help, brother.

01:18:48.107 --> 01:18:49.635
Do not need your help.

01:18:50.791 --> 01:18:54.876
Not our
then from whom.

01:19:04.572 --> 01:19:06.067
All you need... We build

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:09.275
There is everything, the house is yours, man

01:19:09.874 --> 01:19:11.111
They have guns?

01:19:11.281 --> 01:19:14.383
We missiles, machine guns.

01:19:15.003 --> 01:19:18.987
To fight with Van and Torrez
we need more.

01:19:19.905 --> 01:19:23.020
Hello everyone! Listen
There is much to do

01:19:37.925 --> 01:19:39.270
Machete needs your help

01:19:39.271 --> 01:19:41.865
or he will be killed as
Light and killed Fr

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.422
Listen to me

01:19:48.624 --> 01:19:52.800
Yes, I am a woman of the law,
and there are many laws.

01:19:53.239 --> 01:19:56.610
But if we do not offer
justice, then there is no law!

01:19:57.559 --> 01:20:01.968
Lines in the sand are written by
men who are on their backs.

01:20:02.305 --> 01:20:06.423
For power and greed, men
deserve to be eliminated.

01:20:09.103 --> 01:20:14.203
It's time to cross the line, and
show them what the real law

01:20:15.682 --> 01:20:20.091
If we can not cross the border
The boundary in the cross

01:20:25.797 --> 01:20:30.116
You were the girl Machete
I know, you were like him

01:20:30.412 --> 01:20:32.108
What kind?

01:20:32.538 --> 01:20:34.368
dead

01:20:46.952 --> 01:20:50.344
<i> Earlier today, reported

during a conference this afternoon &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:20:56.976 --> 01:20:57.937
<i> about the relationship of Senator &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:20:57.938 --> 01:20:59.666
<i> with a drug dealer
Mexican Rogelio Torrez. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:20:59.848 --> 01:21:01.187
La Red

01:21:01.188 --> 01:21:02.148
<i> According to recent information, &lt;/ i&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:07.146
<i> the re-election campaign McLaughlin
was financed entirely by Torrez. &lt;/ I&gt; &lt;/ i&gt;</i>

01:21:09.799 --> 01:21:12.834
La Red said the senator called
vigilantes to kill you

01:21:13.171 --> 01:21:16.306
And Agent Sarti,
was captured by Torrez.

01:21:16.968 --> 01:21:19.579
The vehicles are armed
and ready to leave

01:21:20.338 --> 01:21:21.901
Time out

01:22:25.701 --> 01:22:27.598
Give me a vest and a rifle.

01:22:31.233 --> 01:22:35.043
Not great, my grandfather
gave their lives in Alamo

01:22:35.044 --> 01:22:39.464
we sell to our nation
a lot of political traitors.

01:22:39.514 --> 01:22:40.819
What do you mean?

01:22:40.954 --> 01:22:46.410
Lied and allowed to live in this Mexican
made us look like idiots.

01:22:47.041 --> 01:22:50.868
Now see here with
a lot of bean

01:22:51.066 --> 01:22:53.711
Do not bother going to know
eliminated, Booth, Senator.

01:22:53.914 --> 01:22:55.934
Got caught too much sun in the desert

01:22:56.042 --> 01:22:57.939
Let's see how it goes

01:22:58.431 --> 01:23:02.025
Let's put you here to
beings executed for the crime of treason.

01:23:05.109 --> 01:23:07.229
No kidding.

01:23:09.986 --> 01:23:11.972
get ready all

01:23:13.030 --> 01:23:13.991
To their posts

01:23:25.930 --> 01:23:27.826
It is the hour of your last wish.

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:31.425
There is no second chance.

01:23:31.985 --> 01:23:33.546
Think about what you will say.

01:23:59.970 --> 01:24:02.191
Aligned...

01:24:05.175 --> 01:24:10.877
I disgraced my oath...

01:24:10.878 --> 01:24:14.625
and I am a traitor who deserves death.

01:24:14.659 --> 01:24:15.612
Ready?

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:18.916
Damn parasites

01:24:20.264 --> 01:24:21.603
Damn terrorists

01:24:21.803 --> 01:24:23.532
Point

You and you, come here, leaving the rest

01:24:51.759 --> 01:24:53.588
Shit

01:24:58.173 --> 01:25:00.126
Get them

01:26:37.845 --> 01:26:38.805
How is your eye?

01:26:38.806 --> 01:26:39.767
Which eye?

01:27:22.194 --> 01:27:26.937
If you want to survive your war
turnest a Mexican is better very quickly

01:27:29.722 --> 01:27:32.144
Have enemies
everywhere, Senator.

01:27:33.029 --> 01:27:35.249
Who can you trust?

01:27:35.778 --> 01:27:40.912
If you offer me a way out
so I'm with you

01:28:13.992 --> 01:28:16.436
Trample the Mexican

01:28:17.975 --> 01:28:18.936
Curse

01:28:28.239 --> 01:28:32.256
Van, we plotted
We must leave here, we

01:28:49.885 --> 01:28:50.892
Hermana...

01:28:51.182 --> 01:28:56.755
Please, I acted
very bad in my life...

01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:00.407
Not even born here
Texas hate, hate the heat.

01:29:00.408 --> 01:29:01.945
Give me my last rites.

01:29:04.406 --> 01:29:06.883
On behalf of my father.

01:29:07.189 --> 01:29:11.998
Your father?... April

01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:19.657
Forget the rest.

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.270
It seems I have to teach him.

01:30:25.638 --> 01:30:27.175
Got something to say?

01:30:30.635 --> 01:30:32.461
Now you have something to say?

01:30:42.839 --> 01:30:44.953
Get them here and see

01:31:07.054 --> 01:31:09.360
We were together in the federal
carnal, remember?

01:31:12.858 --> 01:31:16.027
We were brothers... But you?
ran away for honor, Pendejo

01:31:29.249 --> 01:31:32.131
Then I came to power.

01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:34.534
We killed a lot
of bandits together.

01:31:36.745 --> 01:31:38.378
Now I'm the bad guy.

01:31:39.724 --> 01:31:41.550
What will you do hermanito?

01:31:52.312 --> 01:31:54.522
Look at your Machete now... Cabrón

01:31:59.136 --> 01:32:00.289
He'll kill you

01:32:01.731 --> 01:32:03.172
Will not do

01:32:04.903 --> 01:32:06.056
It's Machete.

01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:11.822
Good point.

01:32:24.479 --> 01:32:27.881
You know, could kill you now
easily. Believed

01:32:29.804 --> 01:32:31.341
This is nothing.

01:32:33.648 --> 01:32:35.186
It sucks.

01:32:36.052 --> 01:32:37.012
But...

01:32:38.743 --> 01:32:42.298
I know I'll wait
for me in hell.

01:32:42.395 --> 01:32:45.182
So...

01:32:47.105 --> 01:32:48.258
is better to say goodbye.

01:34:21.463 --> 01:34:22.424
There is a

01:34:37.394 --> 01:34:38.981
You can speak English, muchacho?

01:34:42.679 --> 01:34:43.744
Welcome to The E. U.

01:35:32.275 --> 01:35:33.515
Want to see my identification?

01:35:33.708 --> 01:35:37.263
Do not worry,
I have something better.

01:35:39.570 --> 01:35:41.492
I charged a few favors.
Look at this.

01:35:41.974 --> 01:35:43.703
I cleaned all your documents.

01:35:45.049 --> 01:35:46.395
You can start again.

01:35:46.588 --> 01:35:47.933
Being a new person.

01:35:48.991 --> 01:35:50.816
Why make me
a new person?

01:35:51.778 --> 01:35:53.508
I'm already a myth.

01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:55.623
Where you will?

01:35:57.642 --> 01:35:59.467
