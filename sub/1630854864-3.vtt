they go for your neck.

01:27.980 --> 01:28.903

01:28.981 --> 01:30.238
But it's not about
staying alive,

You don't know that.
It might just be asleep.

01:57.267 --> 02:00.010
Yeah. Well, when it wakes up
I'd speak to it in Vietnamese

Right.

02:23.035 --> 02:24.143
But nobody else does.

02:24.553 --> 02:28.147
So, we have an opportunity to
humiliate a deserving individual

02:28.223 --> 02:30.065

08:38.167 --> 08:40.744
I'll go get my laptop.
We'll get to the bottom of this.

08:40.746 --> 08:44.147
-This is gonna be so much fun!
-[Emily] Oh, boy.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.933
[alert chiming]

08:46.935 --> 08:48.527
Oh crap, it's still on.

08:48.603 --> 08:49.486
What?

08:50.272 --> 08:51.512
Maya hired a photographer

08:51.590 --> 08:53.256
to shoot our Christmas
card tonight.

08:53.258 --> 08:54.440
And I've got boobs.

08:54.517 --> 08:55.867
Oh, no you don't.

08:55.944 --> 08:57.427
I was gonna lose 10 pounds
before the shoot.

08:57.429 --> 08:59.596
But then you know what happened?
I didn't.

08:59.598 --> 09:03.190
She got matching white satin
shirts for the whole family.

09:03.192 --> 09:04.934
White satin, Victoria.

09:04.936 --> 09:06.770
Your wife's insane.
Postpone it.

09:06.772 --> 09:08.880
I think it's weird to be doing
it this early anyway.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.957
It's a competition thing
with her sister.

09:11.034 --> 09:12.275
And we're never gonna win.

09:12.277 --> 09:13.960
They're a much more
attractive family.

09:14.037 --> 09:15.278
Oh yeah, you showed me
a photo.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.054
They're gorgeous.

09:16.056 --> 09:16.613
Hey!

09:16.782 --> 09:17.781
[chair clattering]

09:18.283 --> 09:20.892
Anyone wanna volunteer for
my vaccination clinic Saturday?

09:20.969 --> 09:22.952
[overlapping]
-Oh, I would love that.
-Yeah, I would love to.

09:22.954 --> 09:24.137
-That sounds great!
-Yes! Absolutely.

09:24.213 --> 09:25.230
Great, thanks.

09:25.624 --> 09:27.732
My post-doc resident, Serge,
will be covering for me.

09:27.809 --> 09:30.126
[overlapping]
-Ooh...
-Did you say this Saturday?

09:30.128 --> 09:32.070
Ooh, I've got a kid's soccer
game actually.

09:32.147 --> 09:33.446
Actually, I'm free.

09:34.149 --> 09:34.573
Really?

09:34.724 --> 09:35.815
Yeah. Totally.

09:35.892 --> 09:37.033
You're my hero.

09:38.820 --> 09:39.819
You know what,
I can do it.

09:40.155 --> 09:42.322
I have experience.
I can move some stuff around.

09:42.398 --> 09:43.473
Now you're my hero.

09:43.475 --> 09:46.251
No. It's about the dogs,
not about me.

09:46.328 --> 09:47.401
Aww.

09:47.479 --> 09:48.044
[laughs]

09:48.647 --> 09:49.813
You bought that?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.482
You just gave up your Saturday
and you still have no shot.

09:52.484 --> 09:55.242
I'm sorry. Did you get an "aww"
from the Hot Vet?

09:55.320 --> 09:57.095
Are you her hero?

09:57.931 --> 09:58.746
Oh, and Frank...

09:58.824 --> 09:59.580
[chair clattering]

09:59.766 --> 10:01.491
I heard what you did
to Templeton,

10:01.493 --> 10:03.602
and I shouldn't admit this,
but hilarious.

10:03.678 --> 10:04.603
[laughs]

10:04.679 --> 10:05.495
Thanks.

10:06.273 --> 10:10.667
You know, it's rare when a hero
is also so funny.

10:10.669 --> 10:11.684
Am I right?

10:12.261 --> 10:13.519
I don't think it was
that funny.

10:13.596 --> 10:14.671
[chair clattering]

10:14.673 --> 10:16.448
Oh, shoot.
False alarm.

10:18.285 --> 10:18.950
You got me.

10:19.527 --> 10:21.453
[Shred] I can't stop thinking
about that kid.

10:22.197 --> 10:23.179
What kid?

10:23.181 --> 10:24.347
The kid that's gonna
come home,

10:24.532 --> 10:27.216
find his favorite stuffed animal
blown to smithereens,

10:27.218 --> 10:29.369
lying headless in the driveway.

10:29.445 --> 10:30.111
That kid.

10:30.279 --> 10:31.354
Look... I'm in a good mood.

10:31.356 --> 10:33.022
Why are you trying
to bring me down?

10:33.024 --> 10:34.633
It's just... maybe we should try
to replace it.

10:34.709 --> 10:35.692
Okay. What the hell?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.193
After lunch we'll stop by
a toy store.

10:37.195 --> 10:38.803
-Nice.
-You happy?

10:38.880 --> 10:39.804
-Yes.
-Alright.

10:39.881 --> 10:41.047
[alert chimes]

10:41.124 --> 10:43.457
Whoa. This day just keeps
getting better.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.459
You have her under "Hot Vet"?

10:45.461 --> 10:46.961
Yeah, I can't believe
she's texting me.

10:47.038 --> 10:48.888
Okay, I gotta... I gotta focus.

10:48.965 --> 10:50.398
[brakes screeching]

10:54.637 --> 10:55.378
What are you gonna say?

10:55.380 --> 10:56.303
I don't know.

10:56.564 --> 10:58.365
I wanna engage
without coming on too strong.

11:02.237 --> 11:04.387
Okay. Okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

11:04.389 --> 11:08.041
What do you think of this?

11:10.228 --> 11:11.244
You nailed it.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.412
-Send.
-[laughing]

11:12.488 --> 11:13.338
[alert chimes]

11:13.581 --> 11:16.157
[alert chimes]
[Victoria] Ha, ha! Bingo!

11:16.234 --> 11:17.583
He's on the hook.

11:17.660 --> 11:18.584
What'd he say?

11:18.586 --> 11:19.736
Just "hey".

11:19.996 --> 11:21.346
He's trying to play it down
like it's no big deal

11:21.423 --> 11:23.848
but I know that he's as giddy
as a little school girl.

11:23.925 --> 11:24.908
What are we gonna text him?

11:25.168 --> 11:27.519
No, nothing yet.
I'm gonna make him sweat.

11:27.595 --> 11:28.411
But thank you.

11:28.413 --> 11:29.245
Yes.

11:29.431 --> 11:31.172
...By the way.
This was a genius idea.

11:31.249 --> 11:32.248
My wife does it all the time.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.750
I'll leave my phone somewhere

11:33.752 --> 11:34.675
and when she calls me,

11:34.936 --> 11:36.528
her name comes up as
"suburban sex goddess"

11:36.604 --> 11:37.603
or "spicy mama".

11:37.605 --> 11:38.863
[chuckling]

11:38.940 --> 11:39.923
Or "need almond milk".

11:40.183 --> 11:41.015
That one's just when she needs
almond milk.

11:41.092 --> 11:42.349
-No, I... I got that.
-Yeah.

11:42.427 --> 11:43.201
Anything?

11:43.203 --> 11:45.245
Nothing. Total silence.

11:46.932 --> 11:48.097
Three dots and a bubble,
here we go!

11:48.099 --> 11:50.208
So, she's crafting
her words carefully.

11:50.285 --> 11:52.268
-Oh, hell yeah.
-Come on.

11:52.270 --> 11:55.939
Okay, how does this sound?
My thing got cancelled.

11:55.941 --> 11:58.365
"...so, you'll be stuck with me
all day Saturday."

11:58.443 --> 11:59.384
Yes!

11:59.778 --> 12:01.110
Dude, have some champagne
chilled in the truck,

12:01.129 --> 12:02.203
just in case.

12:02.464 --> 12:04.556
Right? It does feel officially
safe to get cocky.

12:04.632 --> 12:05.949
Yes.

12:05.951 --> 12:06.599
[laughs]

12:13.382 --> 12:14.474
[Emily] Okay, there's gotta
be something.

12:14.550 --> 12:15.475
Do you have anything?

12:15.810 --> 12:17.810
Zero. And some of the websites
I stumbled onto

12:17.887 --> 12:18.962
were not what I was thinking

12:19.297 --> 12:20.964
and I'm scared there's gonna be
a knock on my door.

12:21.390 --> 12:22.240
Okay, this is maddening.

12:22.634 --> 12:24.892
I cannot be the only person
in the universe

12:24.970 --> 12:27.320
who wants to know the condition
of Shred Taylor's penis.

12:27.396 --> 12:31.040
Alright. I'm gonna use Patel's
computer and hit the dark web.

12:34.070 --> 12:35.402
None of these are big enough.

12:35.480 --> 12:38.405
Okay. She just said, "is it
weird I'm texting you?

12:38.483 --> 12:40.425
"You know, since
we're coworkers".

12:40.427 --> 12:41.909
Well, that's a good point,
you know,

12:41.987 --> 12:43.169
'cause it could get awkward.

12:43.246 --> 12:45.079
Are you sure you wanna
take it there?

12:45.156 --> 12:46.097
I would take a lifetime
of awkward

12:46.174 --> 12:48.157
just to spend one night
with her.

12:48.159 --> 12:49.250
So, what do you think of this?

12:49.252 --> 12:50.417
[keypad clicking]

12:50.495 --> 12:52.086
Maybe a little.

12:52.163 --> 12:54.330
No. Don't say that.
You're gonna get in her head.

12:54.332 --> 12:55.348
Exactly. Keep her off balance.

12:55.424 --> 12:56.349
Why would you wanna do that?

12:56.610 --> 12:58.184
This is a game of chess,
it's a battle of wits.

12:58.261 --> 13:00.019
No, it's more like a dance.

13:00.021 --> 13:00.945
And I'm not saying that

13:01.264 --> 13:03.189
just 'cause I don't know how
to play chess.

13:03.266 --> 13:06.284
Hold her hand.
See where the music takes you.

13:06.361 --> 13:08.119
I haven't been on a date
in five months

13:08.196 --> 13:10.179
so I'm not letting you get
in my head.

13:10.181 --> 13:12.123
I'm sticking with chess.
I'm sending it.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.108
-Fine.
-[alert chimes]

13:14.185 --> 13:15.109
But we're wasting our time.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.128
I know where to get a giant
stuffed animal.

13:17.205 --> 13:19.297
Wait. They have really good
puzzles here.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.208
"Maybe a little."

13:22.360 --> 13:24.344
What a jerk.
Who even says that?

13:25.046 --> 13:26.287
Are you listening to me?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.307
I'm spinning out about
this damn Christmas card.

13:29.384 --> 13:31.643
I'm gonna be on refrigerators
all over Seattle.

13:31.719 --> 13:33.703
A diet inspiration for pudgy,
middle-aged men.

13:33.705 --> 13:35.629
I just find it hilarious
that mister slobbering

13:35.707 --> 13:38.966
all over himself is suddenly
mister self-control.

13:39.044 --> 13:40.151
He takes, like, 10 minutes

13:40.153 --> 13:42.211
to craft each of his
three-word replies.

13:42.213 --> 13:44.230
I'm gonna be a white satin
man boob reminder

13:44.307 --> 13:45.306
to put down the ice cream.

13:45.808 --> 13:48.217
I wanna help my community, yeah,
but not like that.

13:48.219 --> 13:50.444
I'm gonna tell him I had a dream
about him last night.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.905
No, that's mean.
Don't do that.

13:52.907 --> 13:54.189
Too mean or good mean?

13:54.742 --> 13:55.575
You know what I think?

13:55.577 --> 13:56.817
What do you think?

13:57.153 --> 13:58.728
I don't think you're getting
off on the cruelty of the prank,

13:58.730 --> 14:00.505
I think you're just getting off.

14:00.582 --> 14:01.581
What?

14:01.842 --> 14:04.067
[laughs] Yeah. I think you
like the flirtation.

14:04.069 --> 14:04.825
I think you like him.

14:04.845 --> 14:05.751
Frank? That's crazy.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.904
Okay, then why...
why are you blushing?

14:07.906 --> 14:08.996
I'm not blushing.

14:09.257 --> 14:11.182
I'm emotionally tormenting
someone because it's fun.

14:11.259 --> 14:12.166
Mmhmm.

14:12.427 --> 14:14.260
I've got my flaws
and I'm fine with it.

14:14.337 --> 14:15.261
At least your flaws
are on the inside.

14:15.597 --> 14:16.579

I'm trying, Frank.

14:44.943 --> 14:46.367
What is going on?
I thought you were an athlete.

14:46.369 --> 14:48.628
Yeah, in a leg-based sport.
This is, like, an arm sport.

14:48.630 --> 14:49.779
There's wrist stuff...

14:50.131 --> 14:51.514
I gotta get back
into cell service.

14:52.617 --> 14:53.725
See? It's not so easy.

14:53.801 --> 14:54.784
Excuse me. Sir?

14:55.044 --> 14:57.120
How much for that huge lion
on the top row?

14:57.122 --> 14:58.304
Prizes are not for sale.

14:58.381 --> 14:59.213
Look at that, Shred.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.973
We found the one carny
with scruples.

15:01.050 --> 15:02.141
Can you believe it?

15:02.143 --> 15:03.067
We can... we can earn it.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.403
Okay.
Well, how about... now?

15:08.057 --> 15:10.133
That might get you something
from the second row.

15:10.135 --> 15:11.150
Like a little badger.

15:11.227 --> 15:12.151
But are you serious?

15:12.228 --> 15:14.245
We need the lion, Frank.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.331
How much for something
from the top row?

15:17.066 --> 15:18.166
Three badgers.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.160
There's a cash machine
by the funnel cakes.

15:21.237 --> 15:21.994
Two and a half badgers!

15:22.071 --> 15:23.162
This is extortion.

15:23.164 --> 15:25.298
This was a very
reasonable bribe.

15:26.000 --> 15:26.983
Excuse me, guys, sorry.

15:27.168 --> 15:29.152
Excuse me, coming through guys.
Thank you.

15:29.504 --> 15:30.595
Officer Patel,
This is Officer Sands.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.578
What's the situation?

15:31.765 --> 15:35.249
Jumping Jack.
Second time he's escaped.

15:35.326 --> 15:36.935
Anyway, we got him trapped.

15:36.937 --> 15:37.677
What do you need from us?

15:37.753 --> 15:38.828
Not much.

15:39.088 --> 15:41.088
Just stay here and help keep
away the looky-loos.

15:41.090 --> 15:42.014
-Hmm.
-'Kay.

15:42.091 --> 15:43.257
Alright, Jack.

15:43.334 --> 15:45.092
Don't you need, like, a net
or something?

15:45.094 --> 15:46.986
No, just grab him
by the tail.

15:47.355 --> 15:48.112
Sure.

15:48.431 --> 15:50.506
Alright, Jack.
Vacation's over, buddy.

15:50.508 --> 15:51.765
Okay. Whoa!

15:52.118 --> 15:53.025
[Victoria] Um...

15:53.102 --> 15:54.101
What... what should we do?

15:54.362 --> 15:57.863
Stand your ground.
We'll sneak up from behind.

15:57.940 --> 15:59.773
Ooh... hey mate.

15:59.851 --> 16:00.441
Just like this?

16:00.535 --> 16:02.460
[Victoria]
G'day. Hello.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.420
What's he doing?

16:06.524 --> 16:09.616
Don't mess with me, kangaroo.
I boxed Golden Gloves.

16:09.694 --> 16:10.526
[kangaroo growling]

16:10.637 --> 16:11.861
He's got a crazy look
in his eye.

16:11.863 --> 16:12.545
Keep him engaged.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.047
Roger. I'll amp up
the trash talk.

16:15.049 --> 16:16.975
What do you weigh, 140?
Huh?

16:17.051 --> 16:18.292
Welterweight's got nothing
on me, Jack.

16:18.369 --> 16:19.310
I'm 160.

16:19.704 --> 16:22.480
Wouldn't telling him
your real weight be scarier?

16:22.557 --> 16:24.965
Don't press on my insecurities!

16:24.967 --> 16:26.317
He doesn't seem afraid of you.

16:26.394 --> 16:29.303
Oh yeah?
You ready to go? Huh?

16:29.305 --> 16:30.488
'Cause I'm ready to go.

16:30.565 --> 16:31.547
[punch lands]

16:31.549 --> 16:32.473
Oh!

16:32.475 --> 16:35.735
That's gotta hurt, yeah.
You okay?

16:36.571 --> 16:38.663
Keep it up,
just a little longer.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.646
Is that all you got?

16:39.724 --> 16:40.890
[kangaroo growls]

16:40.892 --> 16:43.075
-[thudding]
-[crowd gasps]

16:43.152 --> 16:45.503
Oh, mate. Ow, yeah.
Down you go.

16:46.231 --> 16:48.231
[Zookeeper] Okay. We got him!

16:48.233 --> 16:50.091
-Good work, officer.
-See ya, mate.

16:50.918 --> 16:51.592
See ya.

16:52.161 --> 16:53.236
[groaning]

16:53.496 --> 16:56.330
How you doing down there?
Yeah? You a bit winded?

16:56.332 --> 16:58.099
[Frank] Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

16:59.335 --> 17:01.001
Oh! Finally, a signal.
Three bars.

17:01.079 --> 17:01.853
[alert chimes]

17:02.430 --> 17:04.930
She... she wants me
to come over tonight

17:05.007 --> 17:07.433
for a quote unquote drink.

17:07.510 --> 17:10.936
Holy moly!
The Hot Vet and me!

17:11.013 --> 17:13.114
Knight to queen four!

17:14.108 --> 17:16.159
-What?
-It's chess!

17:23.434 --> 17:25.359
I can't believe I got my
ass kicked by a kangaroo.

17:25.436 --> 17:26.026
Hmm.

17:26.028 --> 17:27.119
[alert chimes]

17:27.196 --> 17:29.047
Ooh! Mrs. Claus is texting you.

17:29.123 --> 17:31.090
Crap. I forgot about
the photo shoot.

17:33.202 --> 17:36.279
Which I no longer have to do.

17:36.281 --> 17:37.446
Maya's not gonna want
a Christmas card

17:37.448 --> 17:39.432
with this hideous face on it.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.379
Everything's coming up Patel.

17:45.456 --> 17:46.314
[laughs]

17:57.151 --> 17:58.326
[doorbell rings]

18:10.590 --> 18:12.239
Uh... by any chance

18:12.317 --> 18:15.000
are you someone we work
with's roommate?

18:15.077 --> 18:16.260
The Hot Vet just doesn't seem
like the type

18:16.262 --> 18:18.487
to do something like this.

18:18.489 --> 18:20.431
Collette, Frank.
Her name is Collette.

18:20.508 --> 18:23.342
Collette the vet?
That's unfortunate.

18:23.419 --> 18:25.436
This is ridiculous.
I'm just gonna call her.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.663
[phone vibrating and chiming]

18:27.665 --> 18:28.589
[gasps]

18:28.666 --> 18:30.066
Yes.

18:31.669 --> 18:32.610
Hello.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.928
Victoria? What are you doing
with Hot Vet's phone?

18:35.006 --> 18:37.031
You tell me.
You're the expert on pranks.

18:38.176 --> 18:39.117
Oh, my God, it was you?

18:39.193 --> 18:41.344
Sometimes the children
of the light

18:41.346 --> 18:44.622
need to use the methods
of the children of darkness.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.865
The whole time?

18:45.867 --> 18:46.940
How does it feel?

18:47.018 --> 18:48.517
[Frank] Bad. It feels
really bad.

18:48.519 --> 18:49.443
Yeah.

18:49.778 --> 18:50.444
[Frank] But I gotta say,
I'm a little impressed.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.464
If I were wearing a cap,
I would tip it to you.

18:53.541 --> 18:56.859
Oh, I would love that.
But did you learn anything?

18:56.861 --> 18:59.286
Yes. That I can dish it out
but I absolutely can't take it.

18:59.364 --> 19:00.972
So, will you stop pranking
people so much?

19:01.048 --> 19:02.214
No.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.458
But I will be more vigilant
about not getting gotten myself.

19:04.460 --> 19:08.128
And, I don't know when,
it may take years...

19:08.206 --> 19:09.296
but I will retaliate.

19:09.374 --> 19:09.981
[Victoria] Can't wait.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.315
Goodnight Victoria.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.209
[giggling]

19:13.211 --> 19:14.377
Sucka lucka.

19:14.712 --> 19:15.636
I'm sorry, Delores,

19:15.897 --> 19:19.473
that you became a pawn
in Victoria's sick game.

19:19.475 --> 19:21.617
Leave the bottle of wine
and we'll call it even.

19:22.645 --> 19:23.719
I don't know.

19:23.979 --> 19:26.164
I had high hopes for this
evening and I splurged.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.040
Okay, what about one glass?

19:29.227 --> 19:30.459
That seems fair.

19:32.488 --> 19:33.487
I gotta say,

19:33.748 --> 19:38.050
you are being very
not horrible about all this.

19:39.328 --> 19:41.237
Hey, can I ask you something?

19:41.239 --> 19:44.089
Has Shred ever mentioned
an unusual sports injury?

19:44.166 --> 19:45.183
Oh, you read about
the frozen penis thing

19:45.259 --> 19:46.258
and wanna know if
it still works?

19:46.335 --> 19:47.243
There's been some discussion.

19:47.503 --> 19:51.856
Oh, I've asked him.
And it's... a-okay.

19:51.933 --> 19:53.724
And I've seen it.
In the restroom.

19:53.801 --> 19:57.320
It's, and I don't know
how else to describe it...

19:58.531 --> 20:00.031
Gorgeous. It's pristine.

20:00.107 --> 20:01.273
Like a renaissance artist
sculpted it

20:01.609 --> 20:04.276
and then killed himself 'cause
he could do no finer work.

20:04.353 --> 20:06.429
God, that guy just glides
through life.

20:06.431 --> 20:08.289
The universe is truly garbage.

20:10.435 --> 20:12.859
Would it be unpleasant if I
joined you for a glass?

20:12.937 --> 20:14.545
It would not be unpleasant.

20:15.289 --> 20:17.289
As long as you properly recycle
that bottle.

20:17.866 --> 20:19.383
Did you just make a joke?

20:20.628 --> 20:21.427
Maybe.

20:23.297 --> 20:25.056
I hope the kid likes it.

20:25.132 --> 20:26.891
This is really nice of you.

20:26.968 --> 20:28.951
No... it's not
that big a deal.

20:28.953 --> 20:30.144
-[alert chimes]
-Oh.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.565
[under her breath]
No...

20:35.068 --> 20:36.083
Okay buddy.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.276
[to herself]
Are you kidding?

20:38.996 --> 20:39.962
[sighs]

20:39.964 --> 20:41.221
You ready to go?
You alright?

20:41.299 --> 20:43.407
-Yeah, oh yeah.
-Okay.

20:44.986 --> 20:46.652
-Whoa!
-What?

20:46.654 --> 20:48.037
Down the street.

20:49.565 --> 20:50.564
[Emily gasps]

20:50.641 --> 20:51.499
[Shred] Wow.

20:54.328 --> 20:58.071
Frank was right.
It is majestic.

20:58.073 --> 21:00.383
It's beautiful.

21:01.261 --> 21:03.335
Um... but also super dangerous

21:03.412 --> 21:06.322
so maybe we should get back
in the car and report it.

21:06.324 --> 21:08.081
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

21:08.159 --> 21:09.976
-We should be fast.
-Oh, my God.

21:11.012 --> 21:12.252
<i> [Dispatch] To all units...</i>

21:12.663 --> 21:16.332
<i> two off-duty officers report</i>
<i> a cougar at 425 Knoll Drive.</i>

21:16.334 --> 21:18.000
Officer Dutch responding.

21:18.002 --> 21:20.278
I am instructing
the reporting officers

21:20.354 --> 21:22.780
to take their fake cougar
and shove it up their-

21:22.857 --> 21:24.031
[bleep]

21:25.359 --> 21:26.325
Over.

21:27.978 --> 21:30.346
[breathing heavily]

21:30.348 --> 21:31.680
No one can know about this.

21:31.682 --> 21:33.273
Obviously.

21:33.351 --> 21:35.684
This was like a one...
one-and-a-half time thing.

21:35.686 --> 21:37.253
Obviously.
