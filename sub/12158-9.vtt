00:07.008 --> 00:09.008
Football on.
Women setting the table.

00:09.010 --> 00:11.810
Why can't every day
be thanksgiving?

00:11.812 --> 00:15.814
So sundays, mondays,
thursdays aren't enough?

00:15.816 --> 00:17.049
Halftime's almost over.

00:17.051 --> 00:20.285
You got any husband or father
questions, lay them on me.

00:20.287 --> 00:21.854
Well, actually,
we need someone to bring up

00:21.856 --> 00:23.455
Some extra chairs
from the basement.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.891
Right. So nothing, right?
Good, good.

00:25.893 --> 00:26.892
Grandpa, wait!

00:26.894 --> 00:29.661
Ha!
Yeah. Almost made it.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.564
I'm doing a class project
on what we're thankful for.

00:32.566 --> 00:35.567
Yeah, he wants to do a video
like your vlogs for outdoor man.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.569
Everybody's thankful
for those.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.171
I liked the one
where the president

00:39.173 --> 00:42.107
Needs to pull his head
out of putin's butt.

00:43.810 --> 00:46.812
Um, okay, why are there
two chairs at the kids' table?

00:46.814 --> 00:48.547
Please tell me
he's bringing a date.

00:48.549 --> 00:52.151
Sorry, Eve, but there's no room
at the boring, grown-up table,

00:52.153 --> 00:55.888
So you get to sit with Boyd
at the special table.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.057
You know "special" doesn't mean
the same thing it used to?

00:59.225 --> 01:01.326
Sorry, honey,
but we're full.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.495
We got grandpa,
bud, Kyle, Ryan.

01:03.497 --> 01:04.596
Mike, shake a leg.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.632
The football intermission
is almost over.

01:08.535 --> 01:12.538
There's someone who should be
at the special table.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.406
So I guess someone
is just gonna have to die

01:14.408 --> 01:15.874
Before I can sit
at the big table?

01:15.876 --> 01:17.876
Ryan's in the den
by himself.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.411
How bad do you want it?

01:20.914 --> 01:24.917
-- Captions by vitac --

01:27.020 --> 01:29.455
Come on, Eve.
What are you thankful for?
[ beep ]

01:29.457 --> 01:31.457
I'm thankful that if
I strangled you right now,

01:31.459 --> 01:33.959
I wouldn't be tried
as an adult.

01:34.894 --> 01:38.030
I'm thankful there is
a lot of people in the room.

01:41.067 --> 01:43.268
All right, can you pace
somewhere else, sally?

01:43.270 --> 01:44.536
You're making me nervous.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.038
Uh, can I confess something
to you, Eve?

01:46.040 --> 01:47.806
All right, if you're coming out,
let me go get my dad,

01:47.808 --> 01:49.908
'cause he's been
expecting this for years.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.644
Please
don't tell Kristin.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.979
She probably
has her suspicions.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.982
Eve, look -- I've made
a significant wager on this game

01:56.984 --> 01:58.317
With a guy at work.

01:58.319 --> 02:01.420
When did you start
betting on football?
Yesterday.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.422
My neighbor told me
the lions couldn't lose,

02:03.424 --> 02:05.591
And he must know
because he's a huge lions fan.

02:05.593 --> 02:09.394
What's the spread?
Yeah, what is <i>the</i> spread?

02:09.396 --> 02:12.431
'cause he tried to explain it
to me, but it's very confusing.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.999
You know
the lions have lost

02:14.001 --> 02:15.734
Nine straight games
on thanksgiving?

02:15.736 --> 02:19.304
So they're due.

02:20.607 --> 02:23.175
Kyle, what do you mean
you're not coming?!

02:23.177 --> 02:25.744
So what if your
grandmother's missing?

02:25.746 --> 02:27.513
She'll turn up, yeah.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.848
And, babe, if she wanders
in the wrong house, who cares?

02:29.850 --> 02:31.517
Everybody's having
the same meal anyway.

02:31.519 --> 02:34.086
Wait, wait. So no Kyle?
No.

02:34.088 --> 02:36.488
[ scoffs ] maybe I should wander
the streets in my bathrobe,

02:36.490 --> 02:38.991
See if he comes
looking for me.

02:38.993 --> 02:41.994
What am I thankful for?

02:41.996 --> 02:44.796
Uh, well, I guess
I'm thankful for science,

02:44.798 --> 02:47.833
Specifically
the fermentation process

02:47.835 --> 02:51.003
That helps me
get through the holidays.

02:51.005 --> 02:55.007
You know, uh,
his teacher's gonna see this.

02:55.009 --> 02:58.443
She'll probably send you
a pamphlet.
Oh, honey, stop.

02:58.445 --> 02:59.845
Hey, guys, guess what.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.114
Kyle's out.
I'm back in the bigs.

03:02.116 --> 03:05.450
Sorry, squirt.
You're on your own.

03:05.452 --> 03:06.852
You know you do
only get to eat the food

03:06.854 --> 03:08.420
That falls off
the big table, right?

03:10.323 --> 03:13.358
Hey, the game started?

03:13.360 --> 03:15.060
Yeah, but Ryan's
still in there.

03:15.062 --> 03:17.062
Since when
did he like football?

03:17.064 --> 03:20.666
What? Did they run out
of ted talks on bees?

03:20.668 --> 03:22.067
Honey, your dad
will be here soon.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.669
You can watch football
with him.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.871
Thanksgiving -- my favorite time
of the year with my dad.

03:25.873 --> 03:29.041
You know, football, turkey,
eat, sleep, repeat.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.475
If I time it right,

03:30.477 --> 03:32.844
We'll never have to say
a word to each other.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.814
Well, might as well
get this party started.

03:35.816 --> 03:38.483
Hey! What do you think
you're doing?

03:38.485 --> 03:40.485
Mnh-mnh.
Mom, I need
to take the edge off.

03:40.487 --> 03:44.189
As if anyone's ever accused you
of being sharp.

03:44.191 --> 03:46.425
You know the rule
in this house.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.860
Mom, don't worry.
I'll leave you some.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.763
All right, you know what?
Maybe one glass with dinner.
Okay.

03:51.765 --> 03:52.864
As long
as you're pouring,

03:52.866 --> 03:54.066
'cause I know
you have a heavy hand.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.501
Oh, stop!
[ chuckles ]

03:56.503 --> 03:58.503
Oh, yes!

03:58.505 --> 04:01.873
Nice football catch.
[  <i>whistle blows</i>]

04:01.875 --> 04:04.176
It was a nice catch,
but it wasn't made by a lion.

04:04.178 --> 04:05.744
He threw it
to the wrong team.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.246
He gets a do-over,
right?

04:08.281 --> 04:10.515
This is what I love
about football --

04:10.517 --> 04:13.518
Explaining it
to somebody else.

04:13.520 --> 04:14.886
[ knock on door ]

04:14.888 --> 04:17.923
Oh, Mike,
will you grab that?
[ stutters ]

04:17.925 --> 04:20.759
Hey, grandpa bud.
Kristin!

04:20.761 --> 04:22.127
Hi!
Oh, wow.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.562
Look at you.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.330
You're like an entirely
different person.

04:27.033 --> 04:29.401
Grandpa!
Hey! Look at you!

04:29.403 --> 04:31.203
What a great, big guy.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.972
[ grunts ]
actually, uh, he is
your great-grandpa, sweetie.

04:33.974 --> 04:34.972
That's right.

04:34.974 --> 04:39.144
You got a good grandpa
and a great grandpa.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.647
Here's a butterscotch.
Go play in a tree.

Son.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.555
[ laughs ] uh...

04:50.557 --> 04:53.759
Yeah.

04:53.761 --> 04:57.329
Um...How -- how was the,
uh, car ride?

04:57.331 --> 05:00.065
Same as always.

05:00.067 --> 05:03.335
Yeah, yeah.

05:03.337 --> 05:07.005
Well, this conversation ran out
of steam quick, didn't it?

05:07.007 --> 05:10.142
But the game's on in the den.
I'll get you a beer.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.576
Hey.
Uh, oh, hang on.

05:11.578 --> 05:13.145
I haven't said hello
to your beautiful bride.
Bud! Hi!

05:13.147 --> 05:17.316
How are you?
And to my smart granddaughter.
Grandpa. Oh.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.750
And to my...

05:18.752 --> 05:21.019
Even smarter,
more beautiful granddaughter?

05:21.021 --> 05:22.854
Sure.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.756
Yay!

05:24.758 --> 05:25.924
You're in a good mood,
bud.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.593
I got a lot to be thankful for
this thanksgiving.

05:28.595 --> 05:29.795
Oh, really? Oh, quick.
Hurry, Boyd.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.463
Someone's actually thankful
for something.

05:31.465 --> 05:34.466
I got an announcement.
I got my license.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.668
I'm gonna start
selling grass.

05:43.609 --> 05:47.679
Bud, please tell me you're
going into the sod business.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.782
No. Pot, weed, marijuana.
It -- it --

05:50.784 --> 05:52.351
All right, let's --
let's clip this on, yeah.
Yeah, that's not a --

05:52.353 --> 05:54.152
Uh, come here.
Come here, Boyd.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.988
Let's, uh...

05:56.990 --> 05:59.624
It's gonna be legal here
in colorado as of January 1.

05:59.626 --> 06:02.527
Are we gonna get like a family
discount, like at outdoor man?

06:02.529 --> 06:05.063
No, no, no!
Hey, hey!

06:05.065 --> 06:06.498
And you want to know
what the best part is?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.233
I'm making you
my partner.

06:09.702 --> 06:13.305
Store's gonna be called
Baxter and son.

06:13.307 --> 06:15.907
Yeah, that, uh,
teacher's gonna be sending me

06:15.909 --> 06:17.809
A whole bunch
of pamphlets now.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.318
Mike, why --
why didn't you tell me

06:26.320 --> 06:28.854
About your dad's
pot-store scheme?

06:28.856 --> 06:30.689
'cause I never thought
he'd go through with this.

06:30.691 --> 06:31.990
It's hard
to get the license.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.592
It's almost frightening
colorado gave him one.
No. I --

06:33.594 --> 06:34.592
It's almost impressive.

06:34.594 --> 06:38.230
You know, we have always taught
our kids to stay away from pot.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.665
Yeah.
And now suddenly
it's the family business?

06:40.667 --> 06:42.434
I can't
tell this guy anything.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.835
If I say no,
he says yes.

06:43.837 --> 06:47.672
He ate a wax apple once
just because I said,

06:47.674 --> 06:49.441
"dad,
that's a wax apple."

06:49.443 --> 06:50.609
To this day, he'll say,

06:50.611 --> 06:52.711
"that's the best apple
I've ever eaten."

06:52.713 --> 06:54.913
Baxter and son?
No, I never said that --
yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.015
I mean, Baxter -- Baxter --
it's not just his name.
I'm not gonna say --

06:57.017 --> 06:58.617
It's your name. It's my name.
I know. I know.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.419
It's our -- it's our kids' name,
our grandson.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.721
It's like we're all getting
rolled up in the same doobie.

07:02.723 --> 07:06.591
Uh, I guess you two
are discussing my proposal.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.026
Just help me out here.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.795
I-I-I thought you were looking
into raising alpacas.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.630
Yeah.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.966
Turns out they're just tall,
mean goats.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.903
So the next logical step
was pot?

07:17.905 --> 07:19.671
You got there, too.

07:20.973 --> 07:22.774
I got my permit,
my store lease.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.976
All I need
is your marketing genius.
No.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.978
Son,
this is a gold mine.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.915
I missed out on polaroid
and hip-hugger jeans.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.917
I'm not missing out
on this one.

07:31.919 --> 07:32.917
Call me old-fashioned.

07:32.919 --> 07:36.221
I don't want people scoring
grass from my kids' grandpa.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.824
Yeah.
You sell guns.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.393
Oh, don't start with this.
Oh, god. No, no.

07:41.395 --> 07:42.894
Don't start with the --
I don't mind, but a lot of
people have trouble with that.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.797
It's the second amendment, dad.
It's in the constitution.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.732
So is my thing.
What thing?!

07:47.734 --> 07:49.734
Pursuit of happiness.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.903
That's in the declaration
of independence, by the way.

07:51.905 --> 07:55.173
Oh,
you're always a nerd.

07:55.175 --> 07:58.310
I don't want to
be part of this.
Fine. I get it.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.745
You don't have any faith
in your old man.
It's not that.

08:00.747 --> 08:01.813
Yes, it is!
No -- no, it's not that!

08:01.815 --> 08:03.348
Yes,
you and your brother both.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.950
What does
he have to do with this?
He worked for you 25 years.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.785
He just wanted to move out
on his own.
Unh-unh.

08:06.787 --> 08:08.787
He was looking
for any little excuse...
No, he wasn't.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.156
You come up with this --
...To push me out of
the business that I started.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.958
I shot him through the foot
with a nail gun

08:12.960 --> 08:15.260
One time,
and he pushed me out.
Yeah.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.796
You nailed his foot
to a board.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.198
I'm going out for a smoke.
Don't worry.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.802
It's just the boring kind
where you get cancer.

08:23.804 --> 08:27.005
[ sighs ]
uh, honey, this is,
uh, probably the wrong time,

08:27.007 --> 08:31.209
But did you tell him
not to smoke around the kids?

08:31.211 --> 08:33.812
But what I'm most thankful for
is this driver's license,

08:33.814 --> 08:35.847
Which allows me
to drink anywhere...

08:35.849 --> 08:36.847
Except this house.

08:36.849 --> 08:41.019
And for clarissa wheaton,
who was too drunk to notice

08:41.021 --> 08:42.354
The night it fell out
of her bra.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.825
Mom?
Nope. Erase that one, too.

08:46.827 --> 08:51.897
It is so not fair that
you get to drink and I don't.

08:51.899 --> 08:56.568
Aw. I'd say I care, but this
is my second glass, so pbht!

08:56.570 --> 08:58.036
[ scoffs ]

08:58.038 --> 09:01.706
No wine, no Kyle.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.174
Seriously,
I'm getting a real sense

09:03.176 --> 09:05.510
Of the hardship suffered
by the amish at pilgrim rock.

09:05.512 --> 09:06.912
[ doorbell rings ]

09:06.914 --> 09:08.713
Oh, I hope that's either
Kyle or his grandma.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.081
Please, please,
please, please, please!

09:10.083 --> 09:12.517
Hmm.
Oh, it's just you.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.919
Aha.

09:13.921 --> 09:15.820
All right, I'm getting
a mixed message here.

09:15.822 --> 09:16.988
The mat says "welcome."

09:16.990 --> 09:18.890
Ah.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.258
Happy turkey day.
Where should I put this?

09:20.260 --> 09:21.927
It's from my vineyard.
I'll take that.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.095
<i>I'll</i> take that.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.932
Welcome, Ed. What?
Did you forget where you lived?

09:26.934 --> 09:30.435
[ laughs ]
dementia humor. Hilarious.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.037
"raving lunatic red"?

09:32.039 --> 09:34.039
Yeah. It's named
after my second ex-wife.

09:34.041 --> 09:37.943
And like her, it's rich,
playful, and has a nutty finish.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.846
This is why I do all
the marketing at the store.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.882
You know, Ed,
why don't you stay for dinner?

09:43.884 --> 09:45.884
Please, no.
We always have room
for one more at our table.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.453
Yeah.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
No, we don't.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.855
Uh, d-don't you have plans,
mr. Alzate?

09:50.857 --> 09:51.923
Yes, yes.
Yeah.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.358
Uh, I'm going up
to the veterans hall

09:53.360 --> 09:55.560
And have thanksgiving dinner
with the guys.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.128
American holiday
with American heroes.

09:57.130 --> 09:59.364
What a night.
[ laughs ]

09:59.366 --> 10:02.367
Actually, it's pretty grim
unless barney brings his niece.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.802
Then everybody
gets to dance.

10:03.804 --> 10:04.936
Now, Ed, come on.
Yeah.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.438
You're gonna
have dinner with us.
Come on. Come on.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.039
Let's go. Let's go.
All right,
all right, all right.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.108
Sorry, Eve.
You're back to the kids' table.

10:12.378 --> 10:13.979
Too bad, squirt.

10:13.981 --> 10:16.381
I'm gonna pretend
I can't cut my own meat

10:16.383 --> 10:18.116
So you have to do it.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.557
Dad, dad, come on!
Come on!

10:25.559 --> 10:27.559
I'm going downstairs,

10:27.561 --> 10:29.461
Get away from all these grumpy,
old men.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.829
But you're a grumpy,
old man.

10:30.831 --> 10:36.334
Well, the wax apple
doesn't fall far from the tree.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.504
Who's winning?

10:39.506 --> 10:42.574
Those...Other guys
who aren't the lions.

10:42.576 --> 10:46.111
I've made a significant wager
on the lions.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.747
They haven't won on thanksgiving
in nine years.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.949
They're due.
That's my system.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.151
Horrible system.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.588
Who are you?

10:56.590 --> 10:58.590
I'm, uh, Ryan,
Boyd's father.

10:58.592 --> 11:01.426
Didn't you run out
on Kristin?

11:01.428 --> 11:04.829
I did,
but I'm back now,

11:04.831 --> 11:07.265
And I'm trying to do my best
for Kristin and Boyd.

11:07.267 --> 11:11.436
I promised myself that if
I ever saw you, I'd kill you.

11:11.438 --> 11:16.541
But -- but you're not
going to, right?

11:16.543 --> 11:19.144
I'll see how it goes.

11:19.146 --> 11:23.682
I'm bud.
It's nice to meet you.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.618
You're a builder, right?

11:26.620 --> 11:30.989
Was. Getting
into the marijuana trade.

11:30.991 --> 11:34.959
Oh, oh, that's gonna be huge
for colorado,

11:34.961 --> 11:36.828
And the doughnut stores
that open next to them.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.830
Why is that?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.965
'cause when you smoke pot,
you get the munchies.

11:43.135 --> 11:45.236
You -- you get hungry.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.072
Good tip.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.975
Better than the one you got
on the lions.

11:50.977 --> 11:53.845
Lucky for you,
you're getting four points.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.814
Yeah, okay, from who?

11:55.816 --> 11:59.150
Who is giving them
these points?

11:59.152 --> 12:02.987
Who bets on football without
knowing what the spread is?

12:02.989 --> 12:05.523
Who opens a pot store without
knowing what the munchies are?

12:05.525 --> 12:09.194
Got me there.

12:09.196 --> 12:12.597
So, uh, now that
you've gotten to know me,

12:12.599 --> 12:14.199
Do you still
want to kill me?

12:14.201 --> 12:16.901
Honestly...Yes.

12:18.871 --> 12:20.872
Man: What kind of antenna
do you have and how much
signal are you using?

12:20.874 --> 12:22.707
What you doing, grandpa?
Man #2: I'm putting
in about 100 watts

12:22.709 --> 12:24.275
Into a 3 element beam just
about 40 feet above the ground.
Um...

12:24.277 --> 12:25.910
I'm down in my basement,

12:25.912 --> 12:28.780
Watching a football game
on a radio.

12:28.782 --> 12:31.082
Now can we do
what we're thankful for?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.084
In a minute. Come on in here.
I want to show you something.

12:33.086 --> 12:37.088
[ static ]
look at this. Ready?

12:37.090 --> 12:38.890
All right.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.892
Mike, k-a-0-x-t-t.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.727
Just a little shout-out.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.896
Anybody having a good time
here on thanksgiving?

12:44.898 --> 12:48.133
[ static ]

12:48.135 --> 12:52.470
Anybody hiding in their basement
to avoid their relatives?

12:52.472 --> 12:55.540
[ all talking ]

12:55.542 --> 12:56.941
Now, the thing I like
about these guys,

12:56.943 --> 12:57.976
If I don't want to
listen to them,

12:57.978 --> 13:00.245
I just turn them down
like this.

13:00.247 --> 13:03.114
Grandpa,
this is due on Monday.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.984
All right. Calm down.
Let's do your little report.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.952
[ beep ]
um,
what am I thankful for?

13:07.954 --> 13:12.390
I'm thankful for radio,
specifically ham radio.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.994
Ham radio is heavily regulated
by the fcc, the same people

13:15.996 --> 13:18.163
Who censor network television,
but not cable,

13:18.165 --> 13:21.599
So drug dealers and murderers
become our heroes.

13:21.601 --> 13:24.602
They not only censor,
but they regulate my ham radio.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.604
They require me
to have a license, tests,

13:26.606 --> 13:28.406
And if they don't like
what I have to say,

13:28.408 --> 13:30.942
They can fine me
or lock me up.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.945
What a great way to treat
the last line of communication

13:33.947 --> 13:36.948
During
the coming apocalypse.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.317
Why does the government choose
to regulate free speech

13:39.319 --> 13:41.953
And ham radio,
but anybody can operate --

13:41.955 --> 13:44.923
Oh, I don't know --
a hemp outlet?

13:44.925 --> 13:46.925
So this thanksgiving,
while the rest of you

13:46.927 --> 13:51.529
Are enjoying your turkey,
I'm savoring my ham.

13:51.531 --> 13:56.167
Happy thanksgiving, fcc,
'cause I know you're listening.

13:58.003 --> 14:00.238
I should have
just done a book report.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.942
It's so great that you found
your grandma, Kyle.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.944
Yeah, now just prop her up
in front of the tv

14:05.946 --> 14:07.111
And stick a real heavy book
in her lap

14:07.113 --> 14:08.446
So she can't
wander off again.

14:10.382 --> 14:12.617
Hey, dad.
Michael.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.786
Uh, Mike,
the detroit lions

14:14.788 --> 14:16.454
Were just given
a two-minute warning.

14:16.456 --> 14:17.655
Is this bad.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.224
Yeah.

14:19.226 --> 14:22.093
It means I've, like, missed
58 minutes of the damn game.

14:23.696 --> 14:24.863
You know, dad, you're gonna
have to eventually talk to me.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.999
Otherwise, I'm not gonna
give you a dinner roll.

14:28.001 --> 14:30.001
You're off the hook.

14:30.003 --> 14:33.004
The bearded kid is gonna partner
with me on the pot store.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.372
Ryan?

14:34.374 --> 14:37.909
Not that bearded kid.
This one.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.982
What do you want me to say?
He calls me "kid."

14:52.057 --> 14:55.026
Ooh. [ laughs ]

14:55.028 --> 14:57.095
Oh, that's
a nice bird, Mike.

14:57.097 --> 15:00.698
Some people fry it, but I say
smoking is the way to go.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.368
I'm sure you do,
cheech.

15:03.370 --> 15:05.203
You're not really
going in business

15:05.205 --> 15:06.938
With chong in there,
are you?

15:06.940 --> 15:08.673
Of course I am.
He has a great business plan.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.842
What's his plan, Ed?

15:10.844 --> 15:12.744
Sell pot.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.513
You just can't get
in the business of selling pot.

15:15.515 --> 15:16.915
[ sighs ]
it's not good for us.

15:16.917 --> 15:19.017
It's really not good
for our business.

15:19.019 --> 15:21.586
We run a store called
outdoor man, not burning man.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.388
I understand,
but I feel bad for bud,

15:23.390 --> 15:25.390
Being put out to pasture
at his age.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.092
A man needs someplace
to go in the morning.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.294
Why doesn't
he just lift the seat

15:29.296 --> 15:30.895
And go where
the rest of us go,

15:30.897 --> 15:33.298
And then head out
and go fishing?

15:33.300 --> 15:35.633
That's the fantasy
we sell at our stores, Mike.

15:35.635 --> 15:38.569
Every time an -- an old guy
comes in and buys a boat,

15:38.571 --> 15:40.939
What he's really doing
is buying his own coffin.

15:40.941 --> 15:44.976
Another reason why I do all
the marketing for our stores.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.145
Well, maybe
dad does need this,

15:47.147 --> 15:48.880
But you shouldn't
do it with him.

15:48.882 --> 15:51.449
You're right.
I shouldn't.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.784
You should.

15:52.786 --> 15:54.886
He just doesn't
want to go into business.

15:54.888 --> 15:57.055
He wants to go into business
with you.

15:57.057 --> 16:00.158
That's why he called
the pot store Baxter and son.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.894
He calls every business
Baxter and son.

16:02.896 --> 16:04.262
He has no imagination.

16:04.264 --> 16:07.398
The guy's had six dogs,
all of them named dusty.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.335
He's scared, Mike,
just like I was scared

16:10.337 --> 16:13.338
When I started with my store
and a certain younger man

16:13.340 --> 16:17.742
Came in to help, and he made
outdoor man what it is today.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.310
Thanks, dad.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.945
All right.

16:20.947 --> 16:23.214
Almost makes up for me
not having half the business.

16:25.951 --> 16:27.952
Ryan:
Oh, no, no, no!

16:27.954 --> 16:29.954
Oh, wait.
What -- what happened?

16:29.956 --> 16:31.789
I'm so sorry.
What?

16:31.791 --> 16:33.358
I know we don't have
a lot of money,

16:33.360 --> 16:35.593
But I just lost a bet
on football.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.429
You what?!
How -- how could you do that?

16:38.431 --> 16:40.264
I am such an idiot.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.866
Yeah, I know you want
some pushback on that,

16:41.868 --> 16:42.867
But I think
you nailed it.

16:44.269 --> 16:46.204
You don't know anything
about football.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.506
You have no idea
how much he doesn't know.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.708
But in the spirit
of the holiday,

16:50.710 --> 16:53.978
I guess I should tell you
that you actually won.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.513
What?

16:56.482 --> 16:57.682
No. The lions lost.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.650
No. You get to add four points
to the lions' score.

16:59.652 --> 17:00.852
That's the spread.

17:00.854 --> 17:04.322
That's the spread?

17:04.324 --> 17:07.291
I won?
Oh, I love the spread.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.528
You won?! Yeah, you won!
Yeah, I won!

17:10.530 --> 17:12.463
Yes! How much?!
$20!

17:12.465 --> 17:13.598
That's it?!

17:14.700 --> 17:16.868
Boyd,
get out your camera.

17:16.870 --> 17:20.471
[ beep ]
daddy is thankful for
illegal sports betting and...

17:23.308 --> 17:26.144
I give up.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.512
Hot, hot, hot.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.414
Hey!
The turkey's ready!

17:29.416 --> 17:32.083
It's time for dinner!
Yeah.

17:33.919 --> 17:35.887
I've been thinking
about my dad's business,

17:35.889 --> 17:37.922
And I want to help him
a little bit.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.992
What kind of message does
that send to the kids? It's --

17:42.861 --> 17:44.495
Look, that's -- get out.
No!

17:44.497 --> 17:46.330
You know, it's just a bit
hypocritical.

17:46.332 --> 17:47.832
Alcohol's just as bad.
It's addictive.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.867
It causes liver disease.
Well...

17:49.869 --> 17:51.035
If they invented booze today,

17:51.037 --> 17:52.570
The fda would
never even allow it,

17:52.572 --> 17:54.572
And -- and the irish would
probably rule the world.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.008
[ sighs ]

17:57.010 --> 18:00.011
And we wouldn't
have had Mandy.

18:00.013 --> 18:02.380
Uh, dad, are you saying
that pot is okay?

18:02.382 --> 18:04.082
[ scoffs ]

18:06.118 --> 18:07.185
No, it's not okay --

18:07.187 --> 18:08.753
Not okay for you
and nobody in this house.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.955
Just because they voted for
something stupid in colorado

18:10.957 --> 18:12.957
Doesn't mean we
got to jump on that train.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.459
All right, Mike,
so -- so you're against it,

18:14.461 --> 18:16.094
But you're gonna go
into business with your dad.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.962
I'm not going
into business with dad.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.797
I just -- I just
want to be his son.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.766
I mean, yeah.
Come on, man.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.601
You know, if it's
not hurting anyone,

18:23.603 --> 18:25.203
Why get
the law involved?

18:25.205 --> 18:29.273
Like sports betting, which
it turns out I'm awesome at.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.708
Hey, hey.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.477
What do you say
we parlay your winnings

18:32.479 --> 18:34.712
On the money line
to the late game?

18:34.714 --> 18:37.482
Mike, I don't even know
what that means. But yes.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.319
Okay, Baxters.

18:41.321 --> 18:43.121
Thank you for the invitation,

18:43.123 --> 18:45.556
But I've got to meet my pals
at the vfw.

18:45.558 --> 18:46.924
Vanessa: Ohh, man.
I'm feeling a little guilty,

18:46.926 --> 18:48.960
And barney's niece
is a definite go.

18:48.962 --> 18:50.828
[ indistinct conversation ]

18:50.830 --> 18:54.065
Hey. See you later.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.900
Yes!

18:55.902 --> 18:57.768
Back at the big table.

18:57.770 --> 19:01.672
You can cut
your own meat, meat.

19:01.674 --> 19:05.877
It ain't over
till it's over, meat.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.814
Dad,
about ready to eat.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.415
Late game's starting.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.583
Oh, perfect!

19:12.585 --> 19:15.920
Football game starts,
and we got to eat.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.855
Kid from one
of those talent shows

19:17.857 --> 19:22.093
Just made a meal
out of the national anthem.

19:22.095 --> 19:26.797
"home of the brave" alone
took a minute and 40 seconds.

19:26.799 --> 19:30.701
I want to talk about
your marijuana business.

19:30.703 --> 19:31.836
Ed's out.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.505
Why? You talked him
out of it?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.307
Because you don't need him.
You've done all the
hard work yourself.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.975
You got the licensing.
That's the big deal.

19:37.977 --> 19:39.710
What you need
is a marketing genius,

19:39.712 --> 19:42.013
And I happen
to know one.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.948
What changed your mind?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.883
I was thinking
about jimmy.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.885
You know, he put up
with you for 25 years.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.054
Now I guess it's my turn.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.024
Just promise me you're not gonna
nail my foot to a board.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.826
Well,
I am delighted to know

19:55.828 --> 19:57.995
That we are finally
gonna become partners.

19:57.997 --> 20:01.032
Um...We're
not gonna be partners.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.634
The truth is I don't want to
be part of the business,

20:03.636 --> 20:06.504
And I do not want
my family part of this.

20:06.506 --> 20:09.073
I'm just a son
helping out his dad.

20:09.075 --> 20:13.311
Not seen, not paid, and,
knowing you, not listened to.

20:13.313 --> 20:17.315
All right,
what's our first step?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.050
First step, dad,
is I want to change the name.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.318
I don't want
Baxter and son.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.819
Oh, come on!
I like that name.

20:21.821 --> 20:23.421
And so it begins
right away.

20:23.423 --> 20:27.925
All right, look.
How about I call it dusty's.

20:33.432 --> 20:36.234
Bud's buds.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.436
Bud's buds.

20:38.438 --> 20:39.604
There you go.

20:39.606 --> 20:40.771
I don't get it.

20:40.773 --> 20:43.774
You will. Come on.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.950
All right.
Dinner's served.

20:52.952 --> 20:55.853
Time for us
to eat the munchies.

20:58.223 --> 21:00.891
Yeah, you're not
using that right.

21:00.893 --> 21:03.594
[ doorbell rings ]
Kyle's here! He made it!
[ laughs ]

21:03.596 --> 21:06.264
Yay.
Oh, crap.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.802
[ beep ]
I'm thankful I get to share

21:11.804 --> 21:15.139
The little table
with my aunt Eve.

21:17.743 --> 21:20.478
See?
Was that so hard?

21:22.881 --> 21:24.282
All right, all right.

21:24.284 --> 21:27.718
To all my...Winos, gamblers,

21:27.720 --> 21:31.989
And drug dealers,
happy thanksgiving.
