WEBVTT

00:14.014 --> 00:16.196
Here comes another one.

00:16.219 --> 00:18.075
See, I knew it.

00:18.099 --> 00:22.349
Look at those turbo-jet engines,
the upswept winglets.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.457
I totally schooled you.

00:25.481 --> 00:27.916
Kill the smug mug,
Amelia Ass-heart.

00:27.940 --> 00:30.958
I got three right
without the extra pair of eyes.

00:30.982 --> 00:33.802
Must be private. No markings.

00:33.826 --> 00:36.234
Maybe it's somebody famous.

00:36.996 --> 00:39.260
- It looks like a Gulfstream.
- Are you sure?

00:39.284 --> 00:42.303
You can tell
by the passenger windows on the side.

00:42.327 --> 00:44.992
Dude looks like a bodyguard.

00:46.172 --> 00:47.630
And there's another one.

00:48.758 --> 00:49.837
Get down.

00:53.471 --> 00:55.155
Those are cops, man.

00:55.179 --> 00:56.628
The other guy's got cuffs on.

00:59.894 --> 01:01.281
- Stop!
- Oh, man.

01:01.305 --> 01:03.329
Are you seeing this?

01:03.353 --> 01:04.851
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:10.113 --> 01:12.128
Maybe they're shooting a movie.

01:12.152 --> 01:14.945
Dude, that's no movie.

01:45.065 --> 01:46.974
Eat your breakfast.

02:45.168 --> 02:46.258
You okay?

02:46.282 --> 02:48.702
I'm not comfortable
with authority figures.

02:48.921 --> 02:50.036
It's why I do what I do.

02:50.798 --> 02:52.482
Computers don't talk back.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.691
Well, I mean, technically, they can.

02:54.715 --> 02:58.800
But even then I can manipulate
the voice to make it soothing if I want.

02:59.015 --> 03:00.924
Sexy, even.

03:02.644 --> 03:05.193
- Too much information.
- Yeah.

03:05.217 --> 03:07.116
What did he ask you?

03:07.140 --> 03:10.150
Same thing I'm gonna ask you,
Agent Callen.

03:10.527 --> 03:12.650
Finish your report?

03:13.780 --> 03:15.856
Have you started your report?

03:17.409 --> 03:21.537
We just buried Agent Vail
two days ago, director.

03:22.706 --> 03:26.216
Does this charade really need
to be perpetuated any longer?

03:26.240 --> 03:27.532
Charade?

03:27.878 --> 03:31.270
Hetty, you know as well as I do,
procedure has to be verified,

03:31.294 --> 03:33.173
reports have to be filed.

03:33.592 --> 03:35.276
Yes, I see.

03:35.300 --> 03:39.134
And by the director
of the entire agency too.

03:40.724 --> 03:42.491
Don't get me wrong.

03:42.515 --> 03:47.287
Your presence here is always valued.
Even welcomed.

03:47.311 --> 03:50.624
And I'd much prefer
to converse with you face to face.

03:50.648 --> 03:53.190
But let's drop the pretence, shall we?

03:56.532 --> 04:01.668
The only thing your presence
is not going to do is this:

04:01.692 --> 04:04.955
Change my mind.

04:08.961 --> 04:11.084
- Hetty.
- Leon.

04:20.640 --> 04:21.719
This is Vance.

04:24.393 --> 04:25.804
When?

04:27.230 --> 04:28.344
How many?

04:29.982 --> 04:31.477
All right.

04:32.026 --> 04:33.770
I need everybody upstairs right now.

04:38.408 --> 04:42.619
An hour ago there was a shootout.
Private jetport, Van Nuys.

04:43.579 --> 04:45.797
Couple of amateur plane spotters
recorded the incident

04:45.821 --> 04:48.347
with a video camera
and a pair of digital binoculars.

04:48.371 --> 04:51.010
That's a prisoner transfer.
One of ours?

04:51.034 --> 04:53.858
Military police. One dead.
Two wounded.

04:53.882 --> 04:55.768
Military police?

04:55.792 --> 04:57.770
In plain clothes on a private airstrip?

04:57.794 --> 04:59.404
Must've been a high-value prisoner.

04:59.428 --> 05:01.280
Who has now vanished.

05:01.304 --> 05:04.699
- Army CID will be all over this.
- And so will we.

05:04.723 --> 05:08.320
The prisoner they were transporting
was the leader of Talib al Jihadiya.

05:08.344 --> 05:10.490
Keshwar?

05:10.514 --> 05:12.291
The Army
has had Ala a Din Keshwar

05:12.315 --> 05:13.740
- all this time?
- Yeah.

05:13.764 --> 05:15.912
Dom was abducted
to exchange for this guy.

05:15.936 --> 05:17.749
And they didn't tell us they had him?

05:17.773 --> 05:20.331
There was a breakdown
in the system somewhere.

05:20.355 --> 05:23.261
- If we'd known about this we...
- It would have made no difference.

05:23.285 --> 05:27.036
- Isn't that right, Miss Lange?
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.

05:29.543 --> 05:32.769
I'll get on the phone.
I'll cut through the bureaucracy.

05:32.793 --> 05:35.454
Agent Callen,
you do what you need to do.

05:35.924 --> 05:37.335
Find Keshwar.

05:41.430 --> 05:44.099
I want another 15 feet
behind that vehicle.

05:48.562 --> 05:50.365
- Thanks.
- Okay.

05:50.389 --> 05:52.580
Agents Callen and Hanna, NCIS.

05:52.604 --> 05:55.266
Major Rick Medina,
Army CID out of Washington.

05:55.694 --> 05:58.541
I just got an earful from my boss,
who got an earful from your boss,

05:58.565 --> 06:01.800
meaning, I'm already prone
not to like you guys.

06:01.824 --> 06:05.077
I'm not feeling a lot of love for you
right now, either.

06:07.081 --> 06:08.385
When was Keshwar picked up?

06:08.409 --> 06:10.884
Intel caught up with him
leaving the Philippines.

06:10.908 --> 06:13.303
We grabbed him
at Honolulu International.

06:13.327 --> 06:16.150
And then decided not to share that
information with any other agency?

06:16.174 --> 06:17.811
You can bitch that one
up the flagpole.

06:17.835 --> 06:20.298
It's above my pay grade,
and I don't play politics.

06:21.012 --> 06:23.088
I deal in reality.

06:23.639 --> 06:26.367
One agent dead, two others wounded,
one critical.

06:26.391 --> 06:29.453
All to free up some Bin Laden
wannabe to kill even more.

06:29.477 --> 06:31.080
- Our case.
- My men.

06:31.104 --> 06:32.826
Our city.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.562
- We pool what we know, then.
- Anything on the shooters?

06:36.361 --> 06:38.567
One of them
was a ground-crew supervisor.

06:39.239 --> 06:40.733
Longtime airport employee.

06:41.199 --> 06:43.962
The other two were newbies.
Their paperwork checks out.

06:43.986 --> 06:46.710
- What was the supervisor's name?
- Pierce.

06:46.734 --> 06:48.929
- First name?
- Mike.

06:48.953 --> 06:52.540
- Who's in charge here?
- Brosnan. First name Susan.

06:53.587 --> 06:54.832
So, what have you got for me?

06:55.589 --> 06:57.083
Nothing.

06:58.300 --> 06:59.710
Knock yourselves out.

07:00.343 --> 07:01.802
You know who I'd like to knock out?

07:05.265 --> 07:08.361
I'd like to talk to you about Mike Pierce.
You're his boss?

07:08.385 --> 07:09.911
And operations manager.

07:09.935 --> 07:13.329
- How well did you know him?
- I guess not as well as I thought.

07:13.353 --> 07:16.975
Last few days,
he seemed a little distant, but...

07:17.528 --> 07:19.319
No, this...

07:19.613 --> 07:20.752
Hard to believe this is real.

07:20.776 --> 07:22.501
What about the other two?

07:22.525 --> 07:23.838
They were new employees.

07:23.862 --> 07:26.548
But I assure you, I had background
checks done on both of them.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.489
Then how did Pierce know
about this flight?

07:28.872 --> 07:30.177
Everybody knew about the flight.

07:30.201 --> 07:33.909
Like they know about every flight they
need to clean and refuel. It's their job.

07:34.378 --> 07:36.347
The passenger list
is kept confidential.

07:36.371 --> 07:37.661
So who told Pierce?

07:40.551 --> 07:44.110
By the glaring looks you're giving me,
you suspect that person is me.

07:44.134 --> 07:46.154
Was I glaring?

07:46.178 --> 07:47.463
I thought I was squinting.

07:47.933 --> 07:50.661
Well, this is one passenger list
I did not see.

07:50.685 --> 07:53.118
I didn't even know
it was a military flight.

07:53.142 --> 07:56.315
Was there any paperwork that Pierce
might have seen that tipped him off?

07:57.193 --> 07:59.269
Not that I can think of.

07:59.904 --> 08:03.000
People who use this facility
pay a premium for our discretion.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.357
Guess the Army
will be getting a refund, then.

08:05.952 --> 08:07.719
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

08:07.743 --> 08:09.548
- Is Pierce married?
- Yes.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.028
I'm gonna need a home address.

08:15.211 --> 08:18.473
I'm not sure who I dislike the most.
Her or him.

08:18.497 --> 08:21.460
That's funny. I got the impression
you disliked them both equally.

08:27.474 --> 08:28.968
Sam.

08:53.041 --> 08:54.417
Sam.

08:55.669 --> 08:59.144
Eric, I need an ambulance.
2724 Rushmore. Now.

08:59.168 --> 09:01.498
Female GSW.

09:02.175 --> 09:04.310
It's okay. It's okay.
They're on their way.

09:04.334 --> 09:06.670
Save my...

09:07.139 --> 09:09.760
Save my husband.

09:10.392 --> 09:12.112
What did she say?

09:12.136 --> 09:13.639
"Save my husband."

09:26.316 --> 09:28.724
Okay. Thanks, Eric.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.919
Vance just released Keshwar's photo
to the media.

09:31.943 --> 09:33.465
Said she should be dead.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.377
Well, they probably thought she was.

09:35.401 --> 09:37.011
Who are "they"?

09:37.035 --> 09:39.325
Keshwar's people.
Tying up loose ends.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.176
L.A.P.D.'s got the perimeter.

09:42.200 --> 09:44.509
Forensic team can't get here
for at least three hours.

09:44.533 --> 09:47.557
- I don't have three hours.
- Good thing you've got me, then.

09:47.581 --> 09:50.139
You think Pierce's wife was in on it?

09:50.163 --> 09:52.559
Maybe she was held captive
in her own house.

09:52.583 --> 09:54.729
Bound, gagged and fed nothing

09:54.753 --> 09:57.716
but yogurt, turkey sandwich
and some sort of green tea.

09:58.891 --> 10:01.845
That was, uh, specific.

10:07.233 --> 10:08.372
And true.

10:08.396 --> 10:10.417
She was their insurance policy.

10:10.441 --> 10:13.423
To make sure that Pierce followed
through with his end of the bargain.

10:13.447 --> 10:17.505
Mm. Which he does,
dying in the process.

10:17.529 --> 10:20.074
- Don't need her anymore.
- And they're gone.

10:20.663 --> 10:22.158
Question is, where?

10:22.790 --> 10:26.551
- The answer is anywhere.
- Or maybe not.

10:26.575 --> 10:29.920
Not if you've lost your driver.
Mike Pierce was a pilot.

10:32.926 --> 10:33.933
Keep looking.

10:33.957 --> 10:36.519
If they're not here in three hours,
I'm leaving.

10:36.543 --> 10:38.571
Hooray for Hollywood.

10:38.595 --> 10:40.639
I hope that means
you found something, Eric.

10:41.184 --> 10:42.405
They slip up.

10:42.429 --> 10:44.452
They always slip up.

10:44.476 --> 10:46.496
No matter how good
they think they are,

10:46.520 --> 10:48.872
they can't escape the all-seeing eye
in the sky.

10:48.896 --> 10:51.499
Or in this case,
the kids with the cams.

10:51.523 --> 10:53.604
Behold...

10:54.781 --> 10:56.086
the van.

10:56.110 --> 10:59.462
- Someone watching.
- And no licence plate.

10:59.486 --> 11:01.630
Shootout happened at 9:47.

11:01.654 --> 11:04.641
And this
taken from a security camera

11:04.665 --> 11:07.503
at the nearest exit
exactly two minutes later.

11:08.420 --> 11:09.974
No rear licence plate either.

11:09.998 --> 11:13.292
- And he picked up a passenger.
- Keshwar.

11:13.550 --> 11:15.093
So how are we gonna find the van?

11:15.928 --> 11:17.896
Hooray for Hollywood.

11:17.920 --> 11:21.157
Who needs a licence plate
when you've got kaleidoscope?

11:21.181 --> 11:23.675
It's trawling through traffic cameras
as we speak.

11:24.395 --> 11:26.328
If they're on the road, we'll find them.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.203
Meanwhile, Keshwar's photo
is running on news channels

11:29.227 --> 11:31.368
and Internet feeds all over the city.

11:31.392 --> 11:33.751
And security at every airport,
train station

11:33.775 --> 11:36.164
and bus depot is on high alert.

11:36.188 --> 11:37.610
He's a rat in a trap.

11:38.993 --> 11:40.368
He's a needle in a haystack.

11:40.953 --> 11:42.803
Yeah, but it's
a very distinctive needle.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.551
The problem
is we don't have a warm body

11:44.575 --> 11:47.785
with known ties to Keshwar
or Talib al Jihadiya.

11:48.211 --> 11:49.788
Yes, we do.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.160
Mowahd.

11:52.673 --> 11:54.915
Moe has not been seen
since Dom was killed.

11:55.385 --> 11:57.437
Well, it ain't for a lack of trying.

11:57.461 --> 11:59.605
I've been running facial recognition
for five days,

11:59.629 --> 12:02.866
cross-referencing his photo with feeds
from every camera I can tap into.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.285
- What are your search parameters?
- I started where you last saw him,

12:06.309 --> 12:08.115
been expanding the radius
block by block.

12:08.139 --> 12:10.960
Teenage kid, all alone,
needs to hide out. Where do you go?

12:10.984 --> 12:12.977
The streets.

12:13.570 --> 12:15.704
Figure out pretty quickly
where the other kids go.

12:15.728 --> 12:18.586
Hollywood, Santa Monica, Venice.

12:18.610 --> 12:21.547
Moe always said
the beach made him feel small.

12:21.571 --> 12:23.488
He might think it's a good place
to get lost.

12:24.289 --> 12:27.598
Change your search parameter.
Start in Venice, work your way east.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.097
What are you thinking?

12:29.121 --> 12:31.085
Two needles in the haystack.

12:33.423 --> 12:34.941
Yes.

12:34.965 --> 12:36.769
Well, I don't care if you have...

12:36.793 --> 12:38.059
Fine.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.420
Sooner than later, I hope.

12:40.931 --> 12:42.781
Thank you. Damn it.

12:42.805 --> 12:48.100
Ah, the proverbial sound of someone
tightrope-walking across red tape.

12:48.605 --> 12:50.289
And falling.

12:50.313 --> 12:53.329
I wanna know why we were left
in the dark in this Keshwar business.

12:53.353 --> 12:54.618
That would be beneficial.

12:54.642 --> 12:59.149
It seemed to be doing all the "quid"
without any benefit of the "pro quo."

13:00.034 --> 13:01.528
I'll keep you apprised.

13:01.952 --> 13:06.056
You seem to be afraid
to speak with me privately,

13:06.080 --> 13:10.709
knowing damn well that I won't do this
in front of my coworkers.

13:12.630 --> 13:13.744
Smart.

13:16.008 --> 13:17.965
But ultimately ineffective.

13:19.387 --> 13:23.491
I've suffered a lot of losses
over the years, Leon. We all have.

13:23.515 --> 13:24.773
Yeah.

13:24.797 --> 13:28.808
But the loss of one of my agents.

13:29.272 --> 13:31.264
I cannot withstand.

13:31.858 --> 13:37.314
Agent Sullivan was my first
and, I swore, my last.

13:37.655 --> 13:42.994
But swearing seems
to have proven a hollow gesture.

13:43.453 --> 13:45.410
And I'm left with no choice.

13:48.917 --> 13:52.511
I thought I'd save Uncle Sam
the postage.

13:52.535 --> 13:54.337
My letter of resignation.

14:05.266 --> 14:06.487
This isn't over, Hetty.

14:06.511 --> 14:09.851
Oh, I'm afraid, for me, it is, Leon.

14:19.614 --> 14:22.105
Been way too quiet, amigo.

14:27.122 --> 14:28.343
If you don't do or say something

14:28.367 --> 14:31.885
worthy of my sarcastic ridicule
in the next ten seconds,

14:31.909 --> 14:34.552
I'm gonna play nothing but show tunes
in the car from now on.

14:34.576 --> 14:36.794
And don't think I won't do it.

14:39.134 --> 14:40.463
Maybe you should talk to Nate.

14:43.597 --> 14:44.676
Or you could talk to me.

14:45.391 --> 14:47.099
What is there to say?

14:47.559 --> 14:49.219
Oh, I don't know.

14:50.562 --> 14:53.729
That you feel responsible
for Dom's death.

14:55.568 --> 14:59.482
Maybe if you'd trained him better,
he might not have been abducted.

15:02.742 --> 15:06.656
Maybe if you'd just gotten there a few
seconds earlier, he might still be alive.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.582
See?

15:11.459 --> 15:13.001
What's there to say?

15:16.422 --> 15:18.913
And then I could say

15:19.800 --> 15:22.350
that you need
to stop thinking that way.

15:22.374 --> 15:24.879
That you did all you could do.

15:25.932 --> 15:27.532
That Dom's death particularly sucks

15:27.556 --> 15:30.097
because he was so young
and didn't deserve it.

15:34.107 --> 15:37.558
You'd probably say something
about losing people before,

15:37.819 --> 15:41.437
and I think we'd both agree
that it never gets any easier.

15:47.829 --> 15:50.118
You might also say that you're sad.

15:52.959 --> 15:54.370
You know what?

15:55.378 --> 15:56.576
I am too.

16:02.928 --> 16:04.801
You had to play
the show-tunes card, huh?

16:09.059 --> 16:10.577
I found a needle.

16:10.601 --> 16:12.025
Which one?

16:12.049 --> 16:13.391
Moe.

16:16.483 --> 16:18.701
Moe. Wait. Moe.

16:18.725 --> 16:21.025
Wait. Moe.

16:32.041 --> 16:33.594
Moe. Moe, put the knife down.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.263
Stay away.

16:35.287 --> 16:36.789
We know you're tired, Moe.

16:37.338 --> 16:39.211
And a little scared.

16:39.590 --> 16:41.499
We also know
you tried to help our agent.

16:42.134 --> 16:44.233
You gave him a key, didn't you?

16:44.257 --> 16:45.887
So he could get away?

16:47.306 --> 16:48.469
He make it?

16:53.104 --> 16:54.514
Come on, Moe.

16:56.315 --> 16:57.346
Come on.

17:07.034 --> 17:08.907
Hands behind your head.

17:13.415 --> 17:14.579
Hey.

17:41.486 --> 17:44.060
You're into some pretty serious
stuff here, you know that, Moe?

17:46.908 --> 17:48.295
Is he gonna roll over?

17:48.319 --> 17:51.364
If he is, Sam's our best shot.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.783
Is your head clear?

17:54.624 --> 17:56.249
Because I need you
in the game, man.

17:58.503 --> 18:00.046
I'm sorry about your friend.

18:02.758 --> 18:04.940
They told me no one would be hurt.

18:04.964 --> 18:08.634
- And you believed them?
- I believed a lot.

18:10.057 --> 18:11.634
But now,

18:12.976 --> 18:14.139
I believe in nothing.

18:19.441 --> 18:21.185
So did you do it?

18:21.777 --> 18:23.236
Do what?

18:24.280 --> 18:25.608
Verify procedure.

18:26.198 --> 18:28.238
File reports.

18:29.243 --> 18:30.927
You know that there was
never any suggestion

18:30.951 --> 18:33.302
of any wrongdoing
regarding Agent Vail

18:33.326 --> 18:34.660
on anyone's part.

18:35.291 --> 18:36.915
So why are you here, director?

18:37.418 --> 18:39.743
I'm here to see
how you guys are doing.

18:40.379 --> 18:41.379
So?

18:42.048 --> 18:43.458
We're doing okay.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.460
And Hetty?

18:48.137 --> 18:49.762
- You know Hetty.
- Mm.

18:50.932 --> 18:52.984
She doesn't just keep things
close to the vest.

18:53.008 --> 18:56.055
She actually sews them in the vest
and covers it with Kevlar.

18:56.979 --> 18:59.352
I actually thought
she'd take it worse.

18:59.691 --> 19:03.735
Especially considering what happened
in '99 with Agent Sullivan.

19:06.864 --> 19:08.857
Maybe this time is different.

19:13.788 --> 19:15.413
I hope so.

19:18.001 --> 19:20.408
This place would fall apart
without Hetty.

19:27.344 --> 19:29.135
That it would.

19:30.513 --> 19:32.636
Why should I help you?

19:33.308 --> 19:35.514
You did the right thing
helping my friend.

19:38.230 --> 19:41.314
Turning your back on them
took courage.

19:42.192 --> 19:44.315
Did it take courage
for you to kill my father?

19:48.031 --> 19:51.650
Taking any life takes courage, Moe.

19:54.621 --> 19:56.507
You know in your heart
there's no other choice.

19:56.531 --> 19:58.913
Was there no other choice?

20:01.253 --> 20:03.411
Your father was pointing a gun
at me.

20:10.596 --> 20:12.138
Now you have to make a choice.

20:14.391 --> 20:16.574
You can help me
find Ala a Din Keshwar.

20:16.598 --> 20:18.761
- So you can kill him too?
- No.

20:19.605 --> 20:21.894
So I can stop him
killing other innocent people.

20:24.735 --> 20:26.146
Will you help me, Moe?

20:27.363 --> 20:28.394
Moe.

20:29.865 --> 20:31.573
Will you help me?

21:00.438 --> 21:03.973
Okay, Pierce.
Let's see what you're hiding.

21:13.577 --> 21:16.032
Whoa, whoa! It's just me. Just me.

21:16.955 --> 21:18.342
Nate, you wanna get yourself shot?

21:18.366 --> 21:20.248
Sorry. Sorry.
I should have called out.

21:21.168 --> 21:23.599
Maybe we should have, like,
a password or something.

21:23.623 --> 21:27.140
You know, like, I say "flash,"
you say "thunder."

21:27.164 --> 21:29.132
Something like that.

21:29.551 --> 21:31.235
We don't have to.
It's not a good idea.

21:31.259 --> 21:34.109
- What are you doing here?
- I thought you could use company.

21:34.133 --> 21:36.429
You know,
checking out Pierce's garage.

21:37.309 --> 21:39.432
Extra set of eyes.

21:39.978 --> 21:42.161
- It's cool.
- Yeah.

21:42.185 --> 21:44.206
Proverbial man cave.

21:44.230 --> 21:46.119
Such a cliché.

21:46.143 --> 21:47.623
"I need space."

21:47.647 --> 21:50.369
Is it bad that mine consists
of a beanbag chair,

21:50.393 --> 21:52.292
cases of Otter Pops,

21:52.316 --> 21:56.738
and Steven Seagal's entire oeuvre
on DVD?

21:57.204 --> 21:58.343
Men.

21:58.367 --> 21:59.998
They always find a way to leave you.

22:00.708 --> 22:01.763
Thinking about Dom?

22:01.787 --> 22:06.171
Dom. My father. My ex-boyfriend.
My old partner.

22:07.214 --> 22:08.874
That's quite a body count, huh?

22:09.800 --> 22:11.603
We all lose people we care about.

22:11.627 --> 22:13.961
I know.
I'm a textbook example, right?

22:14.764 --> 22:17.765
Girl who can't commit
because every man in her life dies.

22:19.143 --> 22:21.871
No. You're just human, Kensi.

22:21.895 --> 22:24.328
It's only natural to be struck by...

22:24.352 --> 22:29.186
This is a World War II
fighter plane. The P-38 Lightning.

22:29.904 --> 22:30.959
And?

22:30.983 --> 22:33.397
This side of the wall
is devoted to cars.

22:33.866 --> 22:35.029
The other side to planes.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.386
This, my friend,
is on the wrong side.

22:37.410 --> 22:39.381
This is the biggest photo here.

22:39.405 --> 22:42.344
Maybe he just wanted
to feature it prominently?

22:42.368 --> 22:44.202
Or maybe...

22:45.044 --> 22:47.203
he wanted to hide something.

22:54.763 --> 22:57.680
Whoa. Careful.
It might be a stash of por...

22:59.309 --> 23:00.554
Nothing.

23:06.566 --> 23:08.475
Must be at least $50,000 here.

23:14.366 --> 23:15.836
It's a flight plan.

23:15.860 --> 23:17.802
Fuel-burn rates, heights.

23:17.826 --> 23:19.821
Low and fast into Mexico.

23:20.330 --> 23:21.635
Pierce was in on it.

23:21.659 --> 23:22.994
I was right.

23:23.709 --> 23:24.989
Keshwar lost his driver.

23:31.884 --> 23:33.627
You got a moment?

23:36.930 --> 23:39.362
I thought
that was pretty self-explanatory.

23:39.386 --> 23:41.883
Well, the words are clear, yeah.

23:42.436 --> 23:44.488
The sentiment is valid.

23:44.512 --> 23:49.350
Just as clear and valid as it was
in 1999 when it was written.

23:51.445 --> 23:53.793
This is the exact same letter
of resignation you turned in

23:53.817 --> 23:55.673
when Agent Sullivan was killed.

23:55.697 --> 23:57.147
You just changed the date.

23:57.743 --> 23:59.403
Pencilled in a new one.

23:59.829 --> 24:01.429
Hetty, this is unacceptable.

24:01.453 --> 24:03.092
- Unacceptable?
- Yes.

24:03.116 --> 24:04.322
No, Leon.

24:05.585 --> 24:07.127
But you wanna know what is?

24:08.212 --> 24:10.858
I choose these people.

24:10.882 --> 24:13.397
And I assess them.

24:13.421 --> 24:14.731
I train them.

24:14.755 --> 24:18.972
I put time and stock and heart
in them.

24:19.474 --> 24:21.347
And they die.

24:22.727 --> 24:27.021
Proving one thing
I've always suspected.

24:29.275 --> 24:31.601
That I am not cut out for this job.

24:32.153 --> 24:34.585
You're more cut out for this job
than anybody I've worked with.

24:34.609 --> 24:39.158
No. I was never, ever,
cut out for this.

24:40.286 --> 24:44.118
I just happen to have the capacity
for it.

24:47.878 --> 24:49.134
Yes.

24:49.158 --> 24:51.887
- Is Director Vance still there?
- He is.

24:51.911 --> 24:53.253
I found the van.

24:56.887 --> 24:58.215
Eric found the van.

25:10.484 --> 25:13.129
You in the van!
This is Major Medina, Army CID!

25:13.153 --> 25:14.518
- How did they beat us?
- Sir.

25:15.030 --> 25:17.331
They get too aggressive,
they could blow everything.

25:17.355 --> 25:20.082
Callen. Sam. Nate, stay with the car.

25:20.106 --> 25:22.171
Throw your weapons
out of the window.

25:22.195 --> 25:24.138
Get out of the vehicle
and down on the ground.

25:24.162 --> 25:25.588
Keshwar could be in there.

25:25.612 --> 25:28.340
On my signal,
we go in hot and heavy.

25:28.364 --> 25:32.055
Final warning.
Hands where I can see them.

25:32.079 --> 25:36.005
Get out of the vehicle
and get down on the ground. Now!

25:37.094 --> 25:39.442
Medina, pull your men back.
You don't know these guys.

25:39.466 --> 25:40.694
But they don't know us.

25:40.718 --> 25:42.681
They do not kill my men
and get away with it.

25:45.603 --> 25:47.322
- Oh, boy.
- You wanna sit this one out?

25:47.346 --> 25:49.157
Fine. But we're taking them.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.993
- My men. My op.
- They're praying.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.876
- They're praying.
- We're going hot.

25:52.900 --> 25:55.251
- Pull back! Pull back now!
- Get away from the van!

25:55.275 --> 25:56.797
Everyone, away from the van.

25:56.821 --> 25:59.456
- Let's go. Let's go. Come on!
- They're martyrs.

25:59.480 --> 26:02.197
- Gotta go! Come on!
- Pull back!

26:37.105 --> 26:38.813
I almost lost three men.

26:39.816 --> 26:41.167
Four.

26:41.191 --> 26:43.067
I'm not sure mine's worth counting.

26:44.946 --> 26:47.294
We'll post up the bodies,
see what we can turn up.

26:47.318 --> 26:49.126
Well, at least
Keshwar's out of the picture

26:49.150 --> 26:51.093
and TAJ's back is broken.

26:51.117 --> 26:52.661
I wouldn't jump to that conclusion.

26:53.205 --> 26:56.574
Well, you just let me know
when I can close the book on this guy.

26:58.251 --> 27:00.244
You think he's in there?

27:01.088 --> 27:03.579
Maybe they want us to think that
so we can give up the hunt.

27:06.802 --> 27:08.296
Dom?

27:09.221 --> 27:10.632
Moe.

27:12.307 --> 27:13.766
Keshwar wasn't in the van.

27:27.239 --> 27:29.885
We all have to believe
in something, Moe.

27:29.909 --> 27:33.326
But first we have to have the courage
to believe in ourselves.

27:40.836 --> 27:43.506
A van blew up this afternoon.

27:47.176 --> 27:48.551
Will you help me?

28:02.859 --> 28:04.293
Okay, what do we know?

28:04.317 --> 28:07.498
We know Mike Pierce was working
for Ala a Din Keshwar.

28:07.522 --> 28:09.547
Yeah, which means Keshwar's men
paid off Pierce

28:09.571 --> 28:10.962
but they held his wife captive.

28:10.986 --> 28:12.843
Maybe Pierce was getting cold feet.

28:12.867 --> 28:15.681
They wanted to make
sure he went through with it.

28:15.705 --> 28:18.339
But it all went south when Mike Pierce
was killed at the airport.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.177
Which means
if he hasn't got a backup plan,

28:20.201 --> 28:21.895
Keshwar's probably gone to ground.

28:21.919 --> 28:24.186
Showed Moe the photos.
All three of the men in the van

28:24.210 --> 28:26.100
were from the youth centre.
He knew them all.

28:26.124 --> 28:28.398
Moe said one of them had a brother
here in Los Angeles.

28:28.422 --> 28:30.313
- His name is Tariq Hassan.
- Eric.

28:30.337 --> 28:31.923
On it.

28:37.394 --> 28:39.528
All right.
He's on a terrorist watch list.

28:39.552 --> 28:42.849
- Last known whereabouts, Sudan.
- One of the shooters from the airport.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.369
Operations manager,
Susan Brosnan.

28:45.393 --> 28:48.036
She told us she performed
background checks on both men.

28:48.060 --> 28:51.334
There is no way this guy would have
been cleared to work at an airport.

28:51.358 --> 28:54.214
- Anywhere.
- So she rubber-stamped him in.

28:54.238 --> 28:55.526
Looked the other way.

28:57.456 --> 28:58.950
So you think I helped that man?

28:59.708 --> 29:01.807
Do I look like a terrorist to you?

29:01.831 --> 29:04.600
Terrorist? No.

29:04.624 --> 29:06.125
An opportunist, yes.

29:07.925 --> 29:09.810
Bet you got a nice
paycheck too, huh?

29:09.834 --> 29:12.275
Look, I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:12.299 --> 29:14.404
You can swear all you want.

29:14.428 --> 29:17.741
But right now our agency
is turning your life upside down.

29:17.765 --> 29:19.429
It doesn't matter how they paid you.

29:20.187 --> 29:21.408
We'll find out.

29:21.432 --> 29:23.265
Or...

29:24.567 --> 29:26.809
you could make it easier
on yourself.

29:36.370 --> 29:38.696
Okay, wait. Wait.

29:39.457 --> 29:41.924
Look, I work for very wealthy clients.

29:41.948 --> 29:47.310
And I'm often given cash
in return for favours.

29:47.334 --> 29:48.597
What kind of favours?

29:48.621 --> 29:52.358
You know, like stocking the plane
with a certain food,

29:52.382 --> 29:57.097
or drink,
or party girls looking for a good time.

29:58.059 --> 30:00.182
You name it, I've done it.

30:00.770 --> 30:03.688
Someone asked me
to give those men a job,

30:03.898 --> 30:05.666
supply them with their paperwork.

30:05.690 --> 30:07.602
Who asked you?

30:08.653 --> 30:10.456
I never saw anyone face to face.

30:10.480 --> 30:14.961
It was a voice on the phone
or an envelope waiting for me.

30:14.985 --> 30:16.298
I don't know.

30:16.322 --> 30:20.005
- You mean, you didn't wanna know.
- It was a lot of money.

30:20.029 --> 30:22.662
It's too bad you won't be able
to spend it.

30:35.222 --> 30:37.025
You spring cleaning?

30:37.049 --> 30:40.889
Heh. Call it what you will,
Mr. Callen.

30:45.524 --> 30:47.706
- It's your diary.
- It certainly is.

30:47.730 --> 30:50.439
You don't spring-clean your diary.

30:53.532 --> 30:55.833
- Are we moving?
- No.

30:55.857 --> 30:57.908
Are you moving?

31:01.248 --> 31:02.659
You didn't get fired, did you?

31:03.542 --> 31:04.953
Certainly not.

31:07.713 --> 31:09.291
You're not...

31:10.299 --> 31:11.758
quitting?

31:14.720 --> 31:16.523
Uh, resigning. It's different.

31:16.547 --> 31:18.347
Not from where I'm standing.

31:22.562 --> 31:24.020
Oh, Mr. Callen.

31:24.897 --> 31:27.364
I've been through a lot.
Decades of "a lot."

31:27.388 --> 31:29.749
And at some point you realise

31:29.773 --> 31:32.625
there are remote islands
you'd like to visit,

31:32.649 --> 31:35.206
novels to lose yourself to,

31:35.230 --> 31:39.157
culinary delights to fatten up on.

31:42.081 --> 31:44.619
Never thought
I'd hear you rationalise.

31:49.589 --> 31:52.756
If you feel the need to take the blame
for Dom's death, Hetty,

31:54.552 --> 31:56.177
you're gonna have to stand in line.

31:56.971 --> 31:58.774
You are gravely mistaken

31:58.798 --> 32:04.157
if you think
I would let the death of one agent

32:04.181 --> 32:09.099
- influence my occupational choices.
- But you are.

32:15.949 --> 32:17.589
That's one of the things I love
about you.

32:29.796 --> 32:31.588
Don't do this.

32:34.635 --> 32:36.462
I'm afraid...

32:37.221 --> 32:43.140
my decision is final, Mr. Callen.

33:06.867 --> 33:10.758
So Keshwar loses his ride to Mexico
and can't risk public transport.

33:10.782 --> 33:12.497
Steal a car, cross at the border.

33:13.082 --> 33:15.596
- It's too risky.
- Pay to be smuggled across then.

33:15.620 --> 33:17.429
That takes time and contacts.

33:17.453 --> 33:19.644
But he's obviously well-funded.

33:19.668 --> 33:23.539
So who else could he pay off
to get him out of the country?

33:24.880 --> 33:27.294
The same people you pay off
to get you into the country.

33:33.561 --> 33:36.491
When you left the country
and hooked up with Talib al Jihadiya,

33:36.515 --> 33:38.159
how did you get back in?

33:38.183 --> 33:40.125
On a ship.

33:40.149 --> 33:43.165
I travelled from Sudan,
boarding in Egypt.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.071
What kind of ship?

33:45.323 --> 33:47.292
A cargo ship.

33:47.316 --> 33:48.523
You remember the name?

33:50.286 --> 33:51.449
Was it flying a flag?

33:52.080 --> 33:57.430
Yes, the flag, it was red.

33:57.454 --> 34:00.688
Had a moon on it and a star.

34:00.712 --> 34:02.754
Turkish flag?

34:04.009 --> 34:07.259
Maybe Keshwar's trying to get out
the same way he got Moe back in.

34:08.554 --> 34:09.694
- Eric.
- Yeah.

34:09.717 --> 34:10.969
Port of Los Angeles.

34:11.433 --> 34:15.027
Cargo ships that arrived ten days ago
flying the Turkish flag. I need it now.

34:15.051 --> 34:16.556
You got it.

34:22.235 --> 34:26.126
Okay, six Turkish-registered ships
on the current Harbor Commission list.

34:26.150 --> 34:28.422
Three arrived in the past four days.

34:28.446 --> 34:30.799
Two arrived
more than two weeks ago.

34:30.822 --> 34:32.963
Got it. The Hamideh.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.598
Arrived ten days ago.

34:34.621 --> 34:37.257
Uh-oh. It's scheduled to depart
within the hour.

34:37.281 --> 34:40.306
- Where, Eric?
- Berth 403. You want backup?

34:40.330 --> 34:42.058
No time.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.630
Put Army CID in the loop.

34:51.014 --> 34:52.533
There she is.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.882
Guard on the gangway.
Probably more each deck.

34:55.603 --> 34:58.520
- I'll take Kensi.
- Right behind you.

35:00.149 --> 35:01.560
Hair.

35:02.151 --> 35:05.152
- What are we supposed to be?
- Drunk.

35:08.824 --> 35:10.817
- Don't judge me.
- I wouldn't think of it.

35:20.503 --> 35:22.721
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

35:22.745 --> 35:25.685
We're going to our stateroom,
thank you.

35:25.709 --> 35:27.188
You've got the wrong place.

35:27.212 --> 35:29.852
Hey, I paid good money
for this cruise, okay?

35:29.876 --> 35:31.964
I paid pretty good money for her too.

35:35.018 --> 35:37.473
Save that for the stateroom.

35:39.230 --> 35:42.765
This is not your cruise ship.

35:48.156 --> 35:49.698
Yes, it is.

35:56.873 --> 35:59.708
Wow. Worth every penny.

36:23.567 --> 36:26.544
Keshwar. We know he's here.
Take us to him.

36:26.568 --> 36:29.085
- You'll have to kill me.
- Oh, I won't kill you.

36:29.109 --> 36:32.591
I'll just blind you and paralyze you,
make you wish you were dead.

36:32.615 --> 36:34.409
Let me ask again.

36:35.412 --> 36:37.738
- Where is he?
- In the bow.

36:42.253 --> 36:43.877
The bow.

36:49.510 --> 36:51.301
Shooter on the deck.

36:57.059 --> 36:58.602
Federal agents, stop!

37:28.550 --> 37:30.875
- Who else is shooting?
- Maybe we got backup?

37:31.511 --> 37:33.361
Put your hands
behind your back. Now.

37:33.385 --> 37:34.610
Federal agents!

37:34.634 --> 37:37.558
Medina! CID! We got him!

37:40.103 --> 37:41.218
Thanks for the diversion.

37:42.272 --> 37:44.099
The diversion?

37:46.485 --> 37:48.394
Keshwar.

37:50.113 --> 37:52.545
Men dying all around him
and he slinks away like a rat.

37:52.569 --> 37:55.208
- Not this time.
- This is our guy, Medina.

37:55.232 --> 37:56.762
No way.

37:56.786 --> 37:59.966
We caught him, we deliver him.
I got a backup team on the way.

37:59.990 --> 38:03.617
- Who told you he was here?
- Your boss. Thank him for me.

38:04.211 --> 38:07.082
Come on. This way.

38:09.425 --> 38:11.501
Eric, let me talk to Vance.

38:14.221 --> 38:16.688
- Vance.
- Has Army CID been briefed on this?

38:16.712 --> 38:19.678
In the interest of joint operational
intelligence, yes, they have.

38:20.269 --> 38:23.448
I told Major Medina that Keshwar
was being held on a Turkish ship.

38:23.472 --> 38:24.821
Well, he beat us to it.

38:24.845 --> 38:27.621
Medina just took Keshwar
into custody.

38:27.645 --> 38:29.205
Callen, I didn't say which ship.

38:29.229 --> 38:33.021
Medina never gave me the chance.
He hung up before I could tell him.

38:40.665 --> 38:42.207
Major.

38:43.501 --> 38:44.888
Just wanna know what it felt like.

38:44.912 --> 38:46.437
What did what feel like?

38:46.461 --> 38:47.980
That moment

38:48.004 --> 38:50.437
when you went from protecting
your country to betraying it.

38:50.461 --> 38:53.183
I'm not sure I know
what you're saying, Callen.

38:53.207 --> 38:55.687
Why you didn't want us on the case.
Why you were determined

38:55.711 --> 38:57.762
to storm that van.

38:58.099 --> 39:00.341
You wanted them dead
so they couldn't identify you.

39:01.603 --> 39:03.928
You were helping Keshwar all along.

39:05.231 --> 39:07.983
Tell me it was just for the money.

39:08.902 --> 39:10.729
It was.

39:11.488 --> 39:14.275
- It is.
- Shoot him.

39:18.787 --> 39:21.456
You know I can't go with you,
Callen.

39:22.415 --> 39:23.744
You can't shoot all three of us.

39:25.126 --> 39:26.786
I can try.

39:55.616 --> 39:56.944
It is over.

39:57.534 --> 39:59.194
So...

40:00.788 --> 40:02.163
what happens now?

40:02.623 --> 40:04.366
You're gonna be placed
under arrest.

40:05.751 --> 40:09.037
You made a choice to join TAJ.
There are consequences.

40:09.630 --> 40:11.041
But you tried to help Dom.

40:12.049 --> 40:13.460
You helped us find Keshwar.

40:14.385 --> 40:16.259
That counts for something.

40:16.762 --> 40:17.960
I brought you here, Moe.

40:20.266 --> 40:21.843
You were 7 years old.

40:23.603 --> 40:25.227
You remember what I told you?

40:28.524 --> 40:30.683
I am your brother.

40:32.028 --> 40:34.020
And you are my brother.

40:34.697 --> 40:36.322
That's right.

40:37.575 --> 40:39.817
I'm still your brother.

40:41.496 --> 40:43.488
And I yours.

41:00.807 --> 41:02.158
Director Vance.

41:02.182 --> 41:04.948
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

41:04.972 --> 41:06.473
I'm headed back to D.C.

41:06.897 --> 41:09.114
I'm setting up interviews
for Hetty's replacement.

41:09.138 --> 41:11.083
If you'd like be considered
for the position...

41:11.107 --> 41:13.957
No, thank you.

41:13.981 --> 41:15.529
I'm very happy where I am.

41:16.031 --> 41:18.107
Then I'll be in touch.

41:19.117 --> 41:20.659
Take care.

41:28.627 --> 41:33.336
A toast to your, uh,
pending retirement.

41:35.217 --> 41:37.886
A symbolic libation.

41:38.554 --> 41:42.053
So you're not mad at me?

41:43.517 --> 41:44.892
No.

41:45.477 --> 41:47.553
Because I realised something.

41:48.022 --> 41:49.564
I'm actually jealous of you.

41:50.900 --> 41:52.098
Now you get to relax.

41:52.693 --> 41:55.789
Sleep in late,
have long lunches with your friends,

41:55.813 --> 41:58.835
play canasta until your fingers bleed.

41:58.859 --> 42:00.860
Now you're toying with me.

42:01.410 --> 42:04.221
Save your whisky and your breath.

42:04.245 --> 42:07.617
Vance already has my letter
of resignation.

42:11.420 --> 42:12.701
You mean this one?

42:15.258 --> 42:17.807
Uh, where did you get that?
Did Vance give that to you?

42:17.831 --> 42:20.003
Well, not exactly.

42:20.638 --> 42:24.766
You know, you can take the kid
off the street, but, uh...

42:27.937 --> 42:30.262
Did I mention the canasta?

42:43.787 --> 42:45.554
Oh, hell.

42:45.578 --> 42:47.953
Better make it a double.
