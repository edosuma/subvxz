Gary will freak.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.240
What is this stuff,
anyway?

00:38.240 --> 00:40.080
Hey. Don't touch
the pouch.

00:40.080 --> 00:41.560
Sorry.

00:41.560 --> 00:43.080
What about
your friend Sam?

00:43.080 --> 00:44.800
Are we getting
a new member?

00:44.800 --> 00:47.960
Next week.
Kiki's up tonight.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.040
Hey, man. I'm dead.

00:51.040 --> 00:52.840
Yeah, from the neck up.

00:52.840 --> 00:56.280
<i>Hey, you wanna be dead
from the neck down?</i>

00:59.000 --> 01:01.680
I was helping
my brother move all day.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.000
Yeech. I hate moving.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.160
Moving's the worst.

01:04.160 --> 01:05.960
I love it.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.400
<i>Say what?</i>

01:07.400 --> 01:08.720
How can you like
moving?

01:08.720 --> 01:12.040
Lugging stuff around
isn't any fun,

01:12.040 --> 01:14.040
but moving
into a new place

01:14.040 --> 01:16.520
is like a mystery.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.480
You always wonder
who lived there before,

01:19.480 --> 01:23.920
you know, what they
were like, why they left.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.800
Sounds like
a pretty good story.

01:25.800 --> 01:27.120
It is.

01:29.400 --> 01:30.800
My story's about moving,

01:30.800 --> 01:33.040
and about promises.

01:33.040 --> 01:34.520
A promise is a pledge,

01:34.520 --> 01:36.400
something to rely on.

01:36.400 --> 01:39.720
You should never
break a promise.

01:39.720 --> 01:42.040
If you do,

01:42.040 --> 01:44.640
it might come back
to haunt you.

02:47.040 --> 02:48.640

02:55.640 --> 02:58.280
It's a lot smaller
with all this stuff in here.

02:58.280 --> 03:00.320
It's a little cramped.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.280
Mom, a sardine can
is a little cramped.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.600
OK. It's small,

03:04.600 --> 03:06.960
but it's all I could
afford right now.

You scared me!

03:32.040 --> 03:33.520
You don't park here.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.800
I don't think the manager
would mind. We're moving in.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.600
I am manager.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.040
I do mind.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.160
You move car now.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.320
What a mess.
What a jerk.

03:46.320 --> 03:49.000
Do you know where
we packed the broom

03:49.000 --> 03:50.360
and the dust pan?

03:50.360 --> 03:51.560
I'll go get it.

03:51.560 --> 03:52.600

05:32.280 --> 05:34.040
What are you
doing out here?

05:34.040 --> 05:36.040
I thought
I heard something.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.040
I don't want you
wandering around at night.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.440
Come back inside.

05:39.440 --> 05:41.480
I wasn't doing
anything wrong.

05:41.480 --> 05:44.080
Well, I asked you
not to do that.

Uh--um, I was...

06:24.000 --> 06:25.280
Who are you?

06:25.280 --> 06:27.760
I'm Angela.
I live in 212.

06:27.760 --> 06:29.440
Do you know
who lives here?

06:29.440 --> 06:31.440
I didn't think
anyone did.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.920
You just moved
into 213, didn't you?

06:33.920 --> 06:35.240
How'd you know?

06:35.240 --> 06:38.280
I've seen you around.
Not many kids live here.

06:38.280 --> 06:39.800
Would you want
to hang out sometime?

06:39.800 --> 06:40.520
Maybe.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.880
Well, I'll see
you later, then?

06:43.880 --> 06:45.600
Yeah. Bye.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.080
Hey, Ma!

06:52.080 --> 06:54.520
Hey. How come
you're so late?

06:54.520 --> 06:56.800
The bus broke down.

06:56.800 --> 06:57.880
Oh.

07:25.760 --> 07:29.200
It's about time
you came to see me.

07:29.200 --> 07:32.520
I'm having some tea.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.520
Will you join me?

07:35.520 --> 07:37.000
What's your name?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Stacy.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.280
Well, Stacy,
it's going to be

07:41.280 --> 07:44.240
a real trick
to drink it from there.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.000
Are you an art
collector, or something?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.880
In a manner
of speaking.

07:53.880 --> 07:57.480
These are all the original
works of Madeline Koegel.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.480
That's me.

07:58.480 --> 07:59.960
You painted
all of these?

07:59.960 --> 08:01.720
A long time ago.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.480
Who's this,

08:03.480 --> 08:04.920
your family?

08:04.920 --> 08:07.760
That's my nephew Frank
and his family.

08:07.760 --> 08:11.040
I never had children
of my own.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.920
Frank promised that I could
always live with them,

08:14.920 --> 08:17.000
but when
his family grew,

08:17.000 --> 08:20.480
he got tired of taking
care of an old woman,

08:20.480 --> 08:23.040
so he asked me
to leave.

08:23.040 --> 08:26.320
He broke his promise?
Just like that?

08:26.320 --> 08:28.400
That's when
I moved in here,

08:28.400 --> 08:29.880
away from
the children,

08:29.880 --> 08:31.880
away from all
my friends.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.520
I kind of lost
all my friends, too.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.559
They're all back
in my old neighborhood.

08:36.559 --> 08:40.320
Well, Stacy, we seem to
have something in common.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.640
Do you know
what I think

08:42.640 --> 08:45.440
might do both of us
a world of good?

08:45.440 --> 08:46.280
What?

08:46.280 --> 08:47.360
Visits.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.520
If we were to visit
now and again,

08:49.520 --> 08:51.520
maybe we wouldn't
miss our old friends

08:51.520 --> 08:52.840
quite so much.

08:52.840 --> 08:54.640
You sure you want
to be friends with a kid?

08:54.640 --> 08:58.080
If you don't mind being
friends with an old woman.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.840
<i> As the days went by,
Stacy and Madeline</i>

09:03.840 --> 09:05.840

of time together.</i>

09:08.040 --> 09:09.360
<i> Stacy helped Madeline
with some of</i>

09:09.360 --> 09:12.480
<i> the tougher chores
around the apartment.</i>

09:12.480 --> 09:16.160
<i> Madeline told Stacy really
cool stories about her life.</i>

09:18.040 --> 09:19.480
<i> It was perfect.</i>

09:19.480 --> 09:21.880
<i> Madeline wasn't lonely
anymore,</i>

09:21.880 --> 09:24.040
<i> and Stacy found
her first new friend.</i>

09:28.760 --> 09:30.680
Stacy, would
you mind terribly

09:30.680 --> 09:33.160
if I asked you
to drop by tomorrow?

09:33.160 --> 09:34.600
No. What's up?

09:34.600 --> 09:36.440
Nothing.
It's just a day

09:36.440 --> 09:39.480
on which I prefer
not to be alone.

09:39.480 --> 09:41.000
No sweat.
I'll be here.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.200
Promise?

09:42.200 --> 09:43.320
Promise.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.720
Wonderful.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.520
I've got a surprise
for you.

09:46.520 --> 09:47.760
What is it?

09:47.760 --> 09:49.480
You'll have to wait
till tomorrow.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.040
OK.
I'll see you then.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.480
Hey, 213!

10:00.480 --> 10:01.680
Hey, Angela.

10:01.680 --> 10:02.440

10:02.440 --> 10:03.640
What are they?

10:03.640 --> 10:05.560
Tickets to
the Battle of the Bands.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.000
I didn't know they
were selling them yet.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.040
They are.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.560
And we're going.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.400
You wanna come?
We got an extra ticket.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.240
Really? When?

10:15.240 --> 10:16.240
Right now.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.560
My mom's getting the car

10:17.560 --> 10:20.040
and we're going to pick
up some of my friends.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.600
You can meet them.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.840
I--I can't.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.360
Why not?

10:24.360 --> 10:27.040
I promised someone
that I'd visit them.

10:27.040 --> 10:31.440
Stacy, this is
the Battle of the Bands.

10:31.440 --> 10:36.000

to start hanging out together.

second and not the next.

What lady?

12:58.880 --> 13:00.400
There's no one

you're not coming.

we're talking

13:57.720 --> 14:00.320

getting back together.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.480
Madeline?

15:48.200 --> 15:50.560
Madeline,
are you in here?

16:34.800 --> 16:36.600
Madeline!

16:36.600 --> 16:37.960
What's going on?

16:37.960 --> 16:41.200
You promised
to visit me.

16:41.200 --> 16:44.080
I didn't want to be
alone on that day.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.520
That day is
the worst day,

16:46.520 --> 16:49.400
and you didn't come!

16:49.400 --> 16:53.360
It was a very lonely
day for me, Stacy,

16:53.360 --> 16:55.560
and do you know why?

16:55.560 --> 16:58.520
It was my anniversary.

16:58.520 --> 17:01.320
10 years ago,
on that day,

17:01.320 --> 17:04.240
is the day I died!

17:28.480 --> 17:30.520
[Thunder]

17:35.480 --> 17:37.480
[Screams]

17:41.960 --> 17:44.000
Angela! Angela!

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
Open the door!

17:45.000 --> 17:47.280
Please, Angela!

17:50.760 --> 17:52.240
[Door slams]

18:01.640 --> 18:02.840
[Screams]

18:02.840 --> 18:06.440
What for you scream?

18:06.440 --> 18:09.200
You go back
your apartment.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.720
I can't.
Madeline's in there.

18:10.720 --> 18:11.880
Who?

18:11.880 --> 18:14.320
The old lady
who lives in apartment 214.

18:14.320 --> 18:17.200
I'm telling you
is no one there.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.120
I can't rent.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.560
Every time
I show apartment,

18:21.560 --> 18:22.720
something happen.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.240
People get scared.
Go away.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.200
You go home now.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.040
Where are you going?

18:30.040 --> 18:32.080
I go fix fuse.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.440
Got to make lights
come back on.

18:34.440 --> 18:35.320
I'll come with you.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.520
<i> Nyet!</i>

18:36.520 --> 18:39.360
You go home now.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.160
Bugsy, no.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.200
Bugsy, come.

18:49.200 --> 18:52.240
Bugsy, please.
Bugsy, come.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.760
Come, Bugsy.

18:53.760 --> 18:56.560
[Thunder]

18:58.320 --> 18:59.720
[Whispering]
Bugsy.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.000
Bugsy, come on.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.400
Bugsy!

19:03.400 --> 19:04.920
[Click]

19:04.920 --> 19:05.640
Bugsy.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.760
Bugsy.

19:09.760 --> 19:12.760
Where are you?

19:18.360 --> 19:19.080
Bugsy?

19:20.880 --> 19:23.200
Come on, Bugs.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.800
[Jiggling noise]

19:39.320 --> 19:42.680
Bugsy! Oh, Bugsy.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.840
You broke your promise.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.760
You're just like
my nephew.

19:47.760 --> 19:49.560
Please don't hurt me.

19:49.560 --> 19:51.720
I waited for you

19:51.720 --> 19:53.360
all day.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.720
You didn't come.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.480
I'm sorry!

19:57.480 --> 20:01.720
How could you
do this to me?

20:01.720 --> 20:03.760
I wasn't trying
to be mean.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.920
I just wanted
to make a new friend.

20:09.840 --> 20:14.280
And did you make
a new friend, Stacy?

20:14.280 --> 20:16.480
I didn't mean
to break my promise.

20:16.480 --> 20:20.720
I came over after,
but it was too late.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.760
You were already gone.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.720
It's very important
to make friends, Stacy.

20:29.720 --> 20:32.280
You shouldn't have
to be alone.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.080
I won't bother you
anymore.

20:38.080 --> 20:41.720
Madeline,
are you really dead?

20:41.720 --> 20:44.480
I'm afraid so.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.880
Aren't you supposed
to move on, or something?

20:46.880 --> 20:48.880
I'm much too old
and set in my ways

20:48.880 --> 20:50.800
to move anywhere.

20:50.800 --> 20:54.120
This is my home. This is
where I'm going to stay.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.200
Is that why
you scare off anyone

20:56.200 --> 20:58.160
who comes to look
at the apartment?

20:58.160 --> 21:00.360
Strangers traipsing
through my home.

21:00.360 --> 21:01.640
How dare they?

21:01.640 --> 21:03.760
Sooner or later,
they're gonna rent it.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.400
You'll have to leave.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.080
I've got
nowhere to go.

21:08.080 --> 21:11.600
Nobody wants me.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.240
I'm not welcome
anywhere.

21:14.240 --> 21:17.840
I don't want to leave.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.760
[Sniffling]

21:23.760 --> 21:26.280
Maybe you won't have to.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.000
Hello.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.560
Ah. How you like
new apartment?

21:39.560 --> 21:41.720
It's great.
We have so much room.

21:41.720 --> 21:45.240
I still don't understand
why it's cheaper than 213.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.400
Heh heh heh.
You get a discount.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.680
Living with ghost.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.640
You watch too much TV.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.080
There's no such thing
as ghosts.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.160
Heh heh heh.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.800
Welcome home, Stacy.

22:17.440 --> 22:21.040
<i> When Stacy and her mom
moved into apartment 214,</i>

22:21.040 --> 22:23.680
<i> she made up
for her broken promise...</i>

22:23.680 --> 22:28.560
Because Madeline wasn't going
to be alone anymore.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.320
The end.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.280
Good story.

22:34.280 --> 22:35.360
Where's the pouch?

22:35.360 --> 22:36.600
The what?

22:36.600 --> 22:38.200
The pouch, with--

22:38.200 --> 22:40.160
it was right here
before we started.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.000
You're getting
on my nerves.

22:47.520 --> 22:49.240
I declare this meeting

22:49.240 --> 22:51.600
of the Midnight
Society closed.

22:51.600 --> 22:54.240
Next week, Betty Ann's
friend is up for initiation.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.560
Don't miss it.

23:03.680 --> 23:05.800
Hey! Where'd
the bucket go?

23:07.440 --> 23:09.960
Tucker,
where's the bucket?
