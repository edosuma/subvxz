00:01.560 --> 00:03.961
Previously on Marvel's
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.040 --> 00:06.930
Why would S.H.I.E.L.D. keep
details of your death from you?

00:07.000 --> 00:08.764
What happened in Tahiti?

00:08.880 --> 00:09.927
Director Fury.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.082
He had a team of scientists
working around the clock.

00:12.160 --> 00:14.640
- I wanted to die.
-And we should have let you.

00:14.720 --> 00:16.050
Once we capture Quinn,

00:16.160 --> 00:17.650
we'll be one step closer
to The Clairvoyant.

00:17.720 --> 00:20.929
- Where's Skye?
-Agent Coulson, it's dangerous

00:21.040 --> 00:23.168
sending her in like that, all alone.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.048
Oh, God. Hang on.

00:28.120 --> 00:30.088
- Put her in there.
- Is it working?

00:30.160 --> 00:33.448
We need to get her
to a medical facility, and fast.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.171
She was shot twice in the abdomen
at close range almost two hours ago.

00:47.240 --> 00:49.846
She's tachycardic, hypotensive,
and lost a significant amount of blood.

00:49.920 --> 00:52.844
We had to lower her core body temp
in order to transport her here.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.048
That's probably what kept her
alive this long.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.963
We'll do everything we can.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.045
Oh, dear, I'm a mess.

01:03.120 --> 01:05.441
No, you were great.

01:08.760 --> 01:11.286
Intubate and let's start
getting that shirt off.

01:11.680 --> 01:12.841
- Here.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.080
Good, block it off.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.605
- We need two liters standing by.
-Good.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.000
100 cc's.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.725
-It's ready.
-Okay, let's prep her for ex-lap.

01:24.480 --> 01:25.811
It's in.

01:25.880 --> 01:27.689
- Fluids wide open.
-All set.

01:27.760 --> 01:30.240
Patient is ready, Doctor.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.691
I'm here.

01:37.560 --> 01:38.686
That's unacceptable.

01:38.760 --> 01:41.525
I need to speak to Director Fury
immediately, please.

01:42.080 --> 01:44.606
Why didn't I stop her? I could've.

01:44.680 --> 01:47.445
As if you could stop Skye
doing anything she set her mind to.

01:47.520 --> 01:50.285
I shouldn't have let her
go after Quinn by herself.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.966
- What was I thinking?
-it's not your fault.

01:53.640 --> 01:55.005
She shouldn't have been there.

01:55.960 --> 01:58.327
I'm her S.O. It's on me.

02:00.200 --> 02:04.046
The one to blame is the man
who shot her. Ian Quinn.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.166
He's responsible.

02:06.240 --> 02:08.003
Yes, the message is
I have an agent dying

02:08.080 --> 02:10.924
and there are questions
only he can answer.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.520
- How is she?
-Not good.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.889
The shots perforated her stomach

02:44.960 --> 02:46.610
and penetrated the large
and small intestines.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.603
We resected what we could,

02:48.680 --> 02:50.842
but there's been too much damage.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.764
- So what's next?
-We can keep her comfortable,

02:53.840 --> 02:55.683
but you'll need to make a decision

02:55.760 --> 02:57.524
on whether or not you wanna keep her
on life-support.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.202
You're saying
there's nothing to be done?

03:05.960 --> 03:08.406
I'm saying you need to call her family.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.528
Get them here as soon as possible.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.563
We're her family.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.641
In that case, I'm very sorry.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.485
Finally. I was beginning to think...

03:44.560 --> 03:45.686
--Oh!

03:48.440 --> 03:50.488
Wait! You can't!

03:51.200 --> 03:54.647
Why? Because you're defenseless?
Like she was?

03:58.720 --> 04:00.245
May!

04:03.840 --> 04:05.330
Outside. Now.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.082
He deserves to die. Not her.

04:16.160 --> 04:18.845
Agreed. But right now,
Quinn doesn't matter.

04:18.920 --> 04:22.367
Only Skye does and I need you
to pilot the plane.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.408
You heard what the doctor said.

04:24.480 --> 04:27.051
She said there was nothing more
they could do for her.

04:27.160 --> 04:29.481
But there are doctors
who brought me back from the dead.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.848
If they can do that,
I'm betting they can save Skye.

04:46.320 --> 04:49.483
H.Q. radioed in.
They've ordered us to hand over Quinn

04:49.600 --> 04:52.251
for interrogation
and transport to the Fridge.

04:52.320 --> 04:53.890
You want me to arrange the transfer?

04:54.560 --> 04:55.925
No.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.401
Quinn stays in our custody
until I say otherwise.

04:58.480 --> 04:59.720
Yes, sir.

05:01.720 --> 05:05.441
You sure about this?
Taking her all the way to Bethesda?

05:05.520 --> 05:07.841
It's where my file says
I was treated after New York.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.002
I understand, but what makes you think
the doctors there

05:10.120 --> 05:11.963
will be able to do anything different?

05:12.080 --> 05:13.127
I know they saved you...

05:13.200 --> 05:15.487
They did a lot more than save me.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.881
It's time you know the truth.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.849
That can't be. What you're describing...

05:24.920 --> 05:26.490
It's medically impossible.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.289
Except for the fact
that I'm standing here.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.328
Proof that it's not impossible.

05:30.400 --> 05:31.765
And here's more proof.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.844
My file.
Describing how they brought me back.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.570
The doctors, the procedures, the drugs.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.850
Sir, it's against the law
for us to read this. Are you sure...

05:41.920 --> 05:43.888
I don't care about your clearance level.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.166
I'm ordering you to read it.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.409
"Death and Recovery Report."

05:49.480 --> 05:52.370
It's only recently that Director Fury
gave me access to this.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.363
I've gone over it dozens of times.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.046
I need you to decipher the medical parts
of it I didn't understand.

05:57.120 --> 05:59.088
Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.891
He should be eager to answer
any questions you may have.

06:01.960 --> 06:04.088
Yes, I'm sure I'll have quite a few.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.640
So, what about Tahiti?

06:06.760 --> 06:08.728
Turns out, not so magical.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.770
Just false memories,
implanted to cover up what was done.

06:11.840 --> 06:16.641
Sir, it says here
your heart was perforated.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.245
Torn in half.

06:18.320 --> 06:19.890
That part of it, I understood.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.725
And yet they managed to heal
the damaged tissue completely.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.040
We need to understand how.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.167
So we can do the same for Skye.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.202
That's what I'm counting on.

06:26.320 --> 06:29.005
- We'll get right on it, sir.
-Thank you.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.804
Hurt much?

06:38.480 --> 06:39.641
I'm fine.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.651
Coulson told me how long he was dead.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.928
You already knew that, didn't you?

06:54.200 --> 06:57.329
I saw Skye in the pod.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.728
Machines filtering her blood,

07:02.560 --> 07:04.369
breathing for her.

07:08.360 --> 07:10.647
I'm not sure I'd make this play.

07:10.720 --> 07:14.327
Fly halfway around the world
hoping for a second miracle.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.086
If Coulson thinks there's
a chance in a million to save Skye,

07:21.200 --> 07:23.521
to save any of us, he'd take it.

07:25.680 --> 07:28.843
People like us, we need people like him.

07:30.760 --> 07:32.171
So, yeah, it makes sense.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.651
A lot more sense than the alternative.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.006
You mean giving up?

07:38.320 --> 07:40.482
Killing the man responsible.

07:41.600 --> 07:43.967
I did like seeing you go after Quinn.

07:45.760 --> 07:48.206
You don't open the blinds
like that very often.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.250
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616,
this is Tower Michael Tango.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.608
You are in violation of
S.H.I.E.L.D. Directive 1297.

07:54.680 --> 07:55.806
Respond immediately.

07:55.880 --> 07:58.121
Disobeying a direct order.

07:58.200 --> 08:01.124
We didn't hand Quinn over
for interrogation.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.247
Great.

08:10.360 --> 08:13.250
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.
How do we proceed?

08:13.360 --> 08:16.284
Prepare to be boarded
and relinquish command.

08:23.160 --> 08:25.766
Really? All the war
and chaos in the world

08:25.840 --> 08:27.888
and S.H.I.E.L.D.
sends a plane after us?

08:27.960 --> 08:30.361
Three planes.
A small transport to dock

08:30.440 --> 08:32.442
and a pair of F-35s
to make sure we hand over Quinn.

08:41.799 --> 08:43.847
They scratch my paint,
I'm gonna be pissed.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.928
I'll await your orders, sir.

08:48.680 --> 08:51.684
Garrett? What the hell
are you doing here?

08:51.800 --> 08:55.361
Well, as opposed to the Level eight
jackass I'm staring at,

08:55.440 --> 08:56.885
I still follow orders.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.724
You're the worst at following orders.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.644
Maybe, but I like this one.

09:02.880 --> 09:07.329
You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn
over for transport to the Fridge.

09:07.440 --> 09:11.206
Agent Antoine Triplett,
Agent Philip Coulson.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.607
You wouldn't know it to look at him,

09:13.680 --> 09:15.444
but Phil's one of our finest.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.484
An honor, sir.

09:18.560 --> 09:22.485
Trip joined me as my specialist
after Ward came to your circus.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.282
- Go secure the prisoner.
-Yes, sir.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.321
Phil, come on.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.846
Just because Fury
gave you this pretty plane,

09:33.920 --> 09:35.843
doesn't mean
they won't shoot it out of the sky.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.331
Why are you really here, Garrett?

09:37.400 --> 09:39.084
S.H.l.E.L.D could've sent
any security team

09:39.160 --> 09:40.491
to collect Quinn. Why you?

09:42.720 --> 09:44.131
You've been chasing him, too?

09:44.200 --> 09:45.645
Since Malta.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.448
Then yesterday, your little Italian job

09:48.520 --> 09:50.249
cost my team weeks of work.

09:50.360 --> 09:51.964
You can't have him. Not yet.

09:52.040 --> 09:53.087
This isn't a request.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.366
Quinn shot one of my agents.

09:54.440 --> 09:57.410
She's on life-support
in a med pod downstairs.

09:57.520 --> 09:59.887
We're taking her
to the trauma center in Bethesda.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.167
Quinn actually pulled the trigger?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.401
Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta.

10:05.520 --> 10:08.285
When he saw her yesterday,
it seems he took it personally.

10:08.920 --> 10:12.606
I never took him for a triggerman.
He pays others for that.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.123
I've lost three of my own chasing him.

10:15.200 --> 10:18.443
Then you understand why I can't give
him to you until we save my agent?

10:18.520 --> 10:20.443
Because if she doesn't make it...

10:26.160 --> 10:27.844
Agent Grant Ward.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.486
- Trip.

10:29.560 --> 10:30.891
-ls Garrett upstairs?
-Yeah.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.489
You know, he still talks about that
1,000-yard shot you took in Bandung.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.050
It was 2,000.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.404
So what are you doing here?

10:38.480 --> 10:40.960
Man, this is like the Playboy jet.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.246
- Mmm-hmm.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.483
I mean, a guy could get soft
bunking in a space like this.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.166
How did Coulson
swing such a sweet ride?

10:48.240 --> 10:50.561
- He died.
-That's tight.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.321
You want to point me to the box
you're keeping Quinn?

10:54.400 --> 10:58.325
H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass
to the Fridge for questioning.

11:02.080 --> 11:03.525
Is that a full bar?

11:03.640 --> 11:05.722
You're welcome to it.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.849
But Quinn stays put
till Coulson says otherwise.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.604
Come on, man.

11:10.680 --> 11:14.048
Garrett was your S.O., too,
so you know how this works.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.963
Why don't you remind me?

11:16.640 --> 11:17.801
Garrett wants Quinn.

11:17.880 --> 11:21.362
It's my job to make sure
Garrett gets what he wants.

11:21.440 --> 11:23.488
- Now where is he?
-Can't help you with that.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.124
No worries. I'll find Quinn myself.

11:28.200 --> 11:29.531
I'm sure he's tucked between

11:29.600 --> 11:31.489
the Jacuzzi and the squash court.

11:32.640 --> 11:33.880
Hey...

11:41.200 --> 11:42.804
Agent Ward, stand down!

11:47.960 --> 11:50.566
Agent Garrett and I
have come to an agreement.

11:50.640 --> 11:53.211
He convinced H.Q. he could interrogate
Quinn here on our plane

11:53.280 --> 11:55.009
as we continue to Bethesda.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.970
Well, I'm a bit of a sweet talker
when I need to be.

11:58.040 --> 12:01.487
You wouldn't believe
what I could talk this son-of-a-gun into.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.921
- Good seeing you, son.
-You, too, sir.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.047
And thank you.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.322
Saving the girl's top priority.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.164
And she might know something.

12:10.240 --> 12:12.811
I never heard of half the drugs
they gave Coulson.

12:12.880 --> 12:14.769
GH-325?

12:14.840 --> 12:17.571
And what about this robotic-assisted
neural microsurgery

12:17.640 --> 12:19.244
they used to implant
the Tahiti memories?

12:19.720 --> 12:21.927
It all sounds so diabolical.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.331
I agree.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.528
We can't argue with the results.
He's walking around.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.486
Yeah. But at what cost?

12:30.120 --> 12:31.849
You read the transcripts.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.809
He begged the doctors to let him die.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.406
This is different. Skye's still alive.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.164
We have to keep her that way.

12:39.720 --> 12:41.563
--Oh.

12:41.640 --> 12:43.847
I've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us.

12:43.920 --> 12:46.241
Hello. Yes.

12:47.960 --> 12:49.371
Are you sure?

12:50.840 --> 12:52.171
That can't be.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.769
And here I thought
I was gonna get to play bad cop.

12:57.880 --> 13:01.362
Ian Quinn, this is Agent Garrett.
He's here to ask you some questions.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.489
No thank you. My head's still
ringing from the last visitor.

13:04.560 --> 13:06.562
At least the last visitor
left you with a head.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.328
I'm not always that considerate.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.244
I'm interested in one
of your newer projects.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.926
Hmm? Oh, but there's
so many to choose from.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.331
Let me be clear.

13:16.440 --> 13:19.125
You have no rights.
You have no lawyer.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.043
The only thing keeping
Agent Coulson here

13:21.120 --> 13:22.121
from throwing you out of this plane

13:22.200 --> 13:24.328
is the very weak heartbeat
of a young agent downstairs.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.926
And the only incentive I have
for not tearing your tongue out

13:27.000 --> 13:29.685
is that you use it
to answer my questions.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.364
- Is that clear?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:31.440 --> 13:33.408
- You understand that?
-No.

13:41.920 --> 13:44.924
Tell us about Cybertek
and the Deathlok Program.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.446
- Deathlok?
-Catchy, right?

13:47.520 --> 13:49.887
Sounds like some wrestler
from the '80s.

13:50.520 --> 13:51.851
What is it really?

13:51.920 --> 13:53.001
Those are dangerous waters.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.082
And the last agent that waded into them

13:55.160 --> 13:56.571
wound up with two in the stomach.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.403
So, she's still alive?

14:03.480 --> 14:06.529
Yeah. And you better hope
she stays that way.

14:06.600 --> 14:07.806
Is that why you shot Skye?

14:07.880 --> 14:09.803
Because she saw
what Cybertek delivered?

14:09.880 --> 14:11.041
No.

14:11.160 --> 14:14.289
I shot Skye because that's what
The Clairvoyant told me to do.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.206
You wanted to see me?

14:17.280 --> 14:19.203
I just got off the phone
with the trauma center in Bethesda.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.009
Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.731
So we'll find a different doctor there
who operated on Coulson.

14:24.640 --> 14:28.201
- That's the thing, actually.
-Coulson was never treated there.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.203
- You're not making sense.
-None of this makes sense.

14:30.280 --> 14:33.363
The doctors listed, the operating
room number, none of them exist.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.965
None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D.

14:37.280 --> 14:40.045
What I find surprising is how
a big-shot billionaire

14:40.120 --> 14:42.407
could fall for this psychic
mumbo jumbo.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.845
Oh, I doubted it at the beginning.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.810
But then I realized it would be
mutually beneficial.

14:46.880 --> 14:49.008
He must have something
pretty terrible on you.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.320
Shooting an unarmed girl?

14:51.200 --> 14:52.531
Let's just say, I learned the hard way

14:52.600 --> 14:54.329
that obeying was in my best interest.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.721
Yet here you are.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.731
Let me assure you, it wasn't luck

15:04.840 --> 15:07.889
that led me to your partner's
black sedan in Berlin.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.881
Or that he'd open the door
for a redhead.

15:11.840 --> 15:13.808
Or those two agents in Morocco.

15:14.800 --> 15:16.802
Did you think it was just
a roll of the dice that my people

15:16.880 --> 15:19.042
found them in that riad?

15:19.120 --> 15:21.771
No. It was The Clairvoyant.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.844
Your Clairvoyant say anything
about me knocking your teeth in?

15:24.920 --> 15:26.684
The Clairvoyant sees everything.

15:30.400 --> 15:32.880
Except what happened to him.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.849
This is still about me?

15:36.520 --> 15:40.366
Wait. You're gonna need
to rewind the tape, Phil.

15:41.720 --> 15:45.327
You heard about my near-death
before the Battle of New York?

15:45.400 --> 15:46.845
There's more to it than that.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.807
I thought I was gone for seconds.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.370
Turns out, it was days.

15:52.440 --> 15:53.805
That's impossible.

15:53.880 --> 15:57.123
Which is why The Clairvoyant will do
anything to know how it happened.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.565
Even order you to shoot Skye.

15:59.920 --> 16:03.641
Wait. You don't know what
S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.802
That's why we're flying
to where I was treated.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.643
So, shooting the girl forces you
to either figure it all out...

16:10.720 --> 16:12.563
So The Clairvoyant can finally see.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.370
Or you let the girl die.

16:22.760 --> 16:24.285
Quinn shot Skye for nothing.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.886
The place where we're going,
the doctors who treated you,

16:26.960 --> 16:28.007
they don't exist.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.482
Or maybe they exist somewhere else.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.166
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.
There are always secrets.

16:34.240 --> 16:37.210
That's my fear, sir.
Your file is filled with secrets.

16:37.280 --> 16:38.486
Experimental drugs,

16:38.600 --> 16:41.251
unknown surgical procedures
we've never even heard of.

16:41.320 --> 16:45.006
Frankly, Fitz and I only understand
about 70% of what's in here.

16:45.080 --> 16:46.889
Even if we do find
where they treated you,

16:46.960 --> 16:48.883
and we were able
to replicate the procedure,

16:49.440 --> 16:51.090
there's the other obvious question.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.924
- Which is?
-Whether we should.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.771
What you experienced, sir,

16:57.840 --> 16:59.490
if this file is even partially accurate...

16:59.560 --> 17:01.642
No one's suggesting
that we submit Skye

17:01.720 --> 17:03.529
to everything that I went through.

17:03.600 --> 17:06.251
But if there's something in here, a drug,

17:06.319 --> 17:09.403
a treatment that can save her,
we need to find it.

17:09.480 --> 17:11.482
- Figure it out.
-Yes, sir.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.166
- You disagree?
-No.

17:16.240 --> 17:20.086
I think we need to do everything
humanly possible to save Skye.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.606
But we need to acknowledge
that doing so

17:22.680 --> 17:25.205
might give The Clairvoyant
exactly what he wants.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.123
It's a risk we have to take.

17:34.160 --> 17:35.810
How is she?

17:35.880 --> 17:39.521
Deteriorating.
And I don't know how to stop it.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.170
The only thing I found
remotely interesting

17:41.240 --> 17:43.846
is something called GH-325.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.251
Some kind of drug?

17:45.320 --> 17:48.051
Agent Coulson was injected with it
and literally minutes later,

17:48.120 --> 17:50.202
his wounds showed signs
of cellular regeneration.

17:50.280 --> 17:52.282
Regeneration? Is that even possible?

17:52.360 --> 17:55.523
Even if this miracle drug does exist,
we don't know where to find it.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.965
We have no coordinates,

17:57.040 --> 18:00.249
no logs of anyone's departure
or arrival...

18:01.000 --> 18:03.571
I think maybe I can help with that.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.250
You set up the echo chamber.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.402
Yeah, I made a couple of calls.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.404
A buddy of mine works in
the archives at the Triskelion.

18:13.480 --> 18:16.006
Agreed to let us access it from here.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.443
Hard to believe but this cube
contains all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s

18:19.520 --> 18:21.010
historical administrative data.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.770
But if Agent Coulson's operation

18:22.840 --> 18:24.490
didn't take place
at a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility...

18:24.560 --> 18:26.324
We won't find any record of it
in here, I know.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.006
But this also contains all
inter-office memos,

18:29.080 --> 18:30.923
travel arrangements, purchase orders.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.570
Maybe we can track down the location

18:33.640 --> 18:36.450
through a virtual paper trail
of some sort or another.

18:36.520 --> 18:37.521
Yeah.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.204
Okay.

18:43.280 --> 18:45.442
Well, let's start
with the travel memoranda

18:45.560 --> 18:48.530
from the date Coulson got stabbed.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.126
Okay.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.890
Or, what about Dr. Streiten's departure
from the Triskelion?

18:53.960 --> 18:56.088
- Maybe they have that.
-Yeah.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.530
Ready?

19:10.840 --> 19:12.330
Here. This is interesting.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.640
A World War II bunker?

19:13.720 --> 19:14.846
Collapsed bunker.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.126
Definitely not a sanctioned
S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.565
"The Guest House?"

19:19.640 --> 19:22.120
Exactly. Guest House.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.771
G-H. GH-325.

19:24.840 --> 19:26.171
Look at the file's access history.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.924
The only record of it being opened...

19:28.000 --> 19:30.128
ls by a Level 10 operative.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.770
Director Fury.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.001
So Fury's been to this place,

19:33.080 --> 19:35.242
and he's the person who sanctioned
the operations on Agent Coulson,

19:35.360 --> 19:38.523
and why aren't you
trying to find the file?

19:45.720 --> 19:47.643
Damn. Encrypted.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.563
Skye could crack this.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.205
What would she do?

20:01.240 --> 20:02.605
It's not an encryption.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.331
The Guest House
is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.970
We don't know who or what's in there.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.724
Be prepared for potential resistance.

20:28.800 --> 20:29.961
No contact from inside?

20:30.080 --> 20:32.401
I've tried every known channel.
No response.

20:32.480 --> 20:34.767
- Place could be abandoned.
-Let's hope not.

20:34.840 --> 20:37.241
We need the people inside
to work on Skye.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.085
Simmons is prepping Skye
to move at a moment's notice, sir.

20:40.160 --> 20:42.003
Trip can help.
He's had med-tech training.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.367
Good. We do our jobs right,
this will all go peacefully.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.727
What if they don't wanna help us?

20:46.800 --> 20:48.245
I'll say, "Pretty please."

20:48.320 --> 20:51.244
We need the doctors alive
and the place intact.

20:51.320 --> 20:54.005
If it does go sideways, Fitz,
I need you down there

20:54.080 --> 20:56.128
to determine what Simmons
can use to help Skye.

20:56.200 --> 20:58.567
And then we take it. Let's move.

21:23.800 --> 21:24.881
Company.

21:24.960 --> 21:26.041
Nothing's scheduled
for a couple weeks.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.281
Try the protocol.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.727
How was the drive from Istanbul?

21:29.800 --> 21:31.404
Countersign?

21:31.480 --> 21:33.562
- No clue.
-Never heard it.

21:33.640 --> 21:36.211
I can't find it in any of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s protocol directives.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.442
This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

21:38.520 --> 21:40.284
We don't know the counter
but we have a team member

21:40.400 --> 21:41.925
in dire need of medical assistance.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.050
We know she can be treated here.

21:44.120 --> 21:47.727
Open the doors, maybe we can work
something out. Do you copy?

21:48.960 --> 21:51.088
How was the drive from Istanbul?

21:52.240 --> 21:54.607
We're looking for medical assistance.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.251
A person's life is at stake.
Will you help us?

21:58.920 --> 22:00.888
How was the drive from Istanbul?

22:03.040 --> 22:04.690
"Pretty please," it is.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.007
These guys are good.
Hacked their way in.

22:19.080 --> 22:21.367
- How the hell did they find this place?
-Doesn't matter.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.885
Didn't know the countersign.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.526
- You want left or right?
-Left's good.

22:38.880 --> 22:42.202
There's an antechamber
and a set of glass doors.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.681
Can't see much beyond that.
Lights are all out.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.929
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go say hello.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.766
Clear!

22:59.600 --> 23:00.965
Okay, Simmons, we're going in now.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.966
Simmons.

23:06.960 --> 23:08.166
Damn it.

23:10.600 --> 23:13.570
Comms are down. There's too much
mountain on top of us.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.085
Trust me, it's better.

23:15.160 --> 23:17.925
You don't want them hearing
the horrible death we're walking into.

23:20.320 --> 23:22.561
Humor, son. You Brits are too serious.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.844
Besides, if the job was easy...

23:24.920 --> 23:26.524
It wouldn't be any fun.

23:27.480 --> 23:29.926
I'm not afraid. Not yet.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.240
I suspect the real danger won't happen

23:31.320 --> 23:33.368
until we breach that bulletproof glass.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.724
Probably a stairwell back to the surface.

23:42.360 --> 23:44.601
What do you think, Fitz?
Can you get us inside?

23:44.680 --> 23:47.729
To certain, horrible death? Absolutely.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.240
Okay, sir, just say the word.

23:56.320 --> 23:58.322
Once we get inside,
everybody find cover.

23:58.400 --> 24:00.289
All right, gentlemen, here we go.

24:21.480 --> 24:22.970
We've come for medical assistance,

24:23.040 --> 24:26.044
but if you continue firing on us,
we will defend...

24:30.760 --> 24:32.091
I count two hostiles.

24:32.160 --> 24:33.605
Copy that. Ready?

24:43.200 --> 24:45.487
- You got one of those little flash things?
-Yeah.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.001
Ward.

25:06.480 --> 25:07.561
Clear!

25:07.760 --> 25:09.922
- See if you can get some lights on.
-Yeah.

25:14.760 --> 25:17.081
No hard feelings, Bob.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.480
Clear.

25:24.160 --> 25:28.324
We're not done. This one's hit.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.

25:44.800 --> 25:45.847
Go.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.403
We're gonna get you medical help.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.448
Is anyone else down here?
Where are the doctors?

26:01.520 --> 26:03.409
Med staff doesn't stay here.

26:03.480 --> 26:07.201
We're looking for a drug.
GH-325. It might help you, too.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.164
Do I know you?

26:10.280 --> 26:11.645
I don't know.

26:11.720 --> 26:14.564
I might've spent some time here
a while back.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.610
Then you know about the timer.

26:18.960 --> 26:20.007
We got a problem!

26:26.400 --> 26:27.640
Semtex.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.802
The whole place is rigged to blow.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.770
There's enough explosive to bring down
the whole mountain on top of us.

26:34.920 --> 26:37.400
Sir, less than 10 minutes.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.486
It's probably a fail-safe.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.608
If the guards had eliminated us,
they'd stop the timer.

26:41.680 --> 26:42.841
Since they didn't...

26:42.920 --> 26:44.763
There's some kind
of emergency override.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.366
Skye could probably get past it,
but I can't hack the panel,

26:47.440 --> 26:49.169
which means we're trapped in here.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.970
You're the guy who taught Ward
how to disarm nuclear bombs.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.804
Figure out a way to get us out of here.

26:54.880 --> 26:56.450
Let's go find the drug.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.001
So, this is some sort of medical facility?

27:02.080 --> 27:05.289
Yeah, but if nobody's here,
I'm not sure it'll do us any good.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.327
--Tough when it's your team.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.442
You guys go back a ways?

27:12.520 --> 27:14.045
Not really. A few months.

27:14.560 --> 27:15.891
We have nothing in common.

27:16.360 --> 27:17.964
Couldn't be more different.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.801
But you can't imagine
your life without her?

27:22.640 --> 27:26.122
Yes. You've experienced that,
Agent Triplett?

27:26.680 --> 27:28.444
I have.

27:28.520 --> 27:31.251
Sometimes a person
takes you by surprise.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.731
Yeah.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.204
She's very lucky to have you.

27:37.920 --> 27:40.002
I know if anything bad
ever happens to me,

27:40.400 --> 27:43.131
I hope you're in my corner, too.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.130
Comms are down.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.521
If I don't hear anything within the hour,
I'm going after them.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.762
- Skye's coding. Both of you, now.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.446
How can we help?

27:56.520 --> 27:58.761
- I need a unit of epi.
-Got it.

28:20.440 --> 28:22.169
Let me die!

28:22.240 --> 28:24.049
Don't. Let me die, please.

28:25.080 --> 28:26.923
Let me die!

28:34.120 --> 28:36.441
- Is that where...
-Yeah.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.722
Timer doesn't control the explosion.

28:44.800 --> 28:47.770
It's just a clock.
Detonator must be somewhere else.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.604
It's not in here, I'd have found it.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.091
There's no time to
search the whole compound.

28:52.520 --> 28:55.046
Maybe we can take some Semtex,
use it on the doors.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.688
Sir, are you sure you wanna...

29:14.560 --> 29:16.449
We should put suits on
before we go in there.

29:16.520 --> 29:18.488
You're right. But there's no time.

29:25.920 --> 29:27.763
Wish I could speak to Simmons.

29:27.840 --> 29:30.286
She'd know what most of this stuff is.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.488
Or at least which stuff not to touch.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.080
Fitz.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.121
Oh.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.684
I don't see any GH.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.201
Agent Coulson. It's locked.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.203
Here. Put these on.

30:01.480 --> 30:02.766
Got it.

30:03.840 --> 30:07.083
Time to go. We couldn't stop it.
Four minutes and counting.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.247
Almost there.

30:08.320 --> 30:10.402
Semtex throughout here as well.

30:11.520 --> 30:15.161
This is it. 325. This is the one we want.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.288
We gotta go. Get it up to Simmons.

30:17.360 --> 30:18.407
Yeah.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.160
Sir.

30:21.400 --> 30:23.607
I'll be right behind you. Go.

30:44.640 --> 30:45.687
Three minutes.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.922
Have you worked much
with munitions, Agent Fitz?

30:48.960 --> 30:51.645
Explosives are a fascinating specialty.

30:52.400 --> 30:54.164
Very exacting.

30:54.240 --> 30:57.050
Too big a concussion
can trigger a chain reaction,

30:57.120 --> 30:59.361
bury us like fossils for 1,000 years.

30:59.920 --> 31:03.686
Guess we don't have to worry about
The Clairvoyant finding this place.

31:03.760 --> 31:06.889
Agent Ward, you do the honors.

31:06.960 --> 31:08.803
Thought you'd never ask.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.244
- Can you slip through?
-Yeah.

31:20.320 --> 31:22.766
Go. Get that drug up there.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.724
- Coulson.
-Where the hell is he?

31:26.800 --> 31:28.325
Phil!

31:29.000 --> 31:31.287
Go with Fitz.
Make sure that drug gets to the girl.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.407
Agent Garrett...

31:32.480 --> 31:34.164
Go! Save the girl.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.362
- Weak, erratic heart rate.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.403
Each time we save her, I ask myself,

31:40.480 --> 31:42.801
"Is this what Skye would want?"

31:43.320 --> 31:45.084
We didn't come this far to quit.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.242
Get off the ground immediately.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.644
- They're alive. Maybe we can...

31:50.160 --> 31:52.481
--Fitz, come in. What's your status?

31:57.320 --> 31:59.368
GARRETT; Phil. Phil, What the hell?

31:59.440 --> 32:01.761
Clock's not slowing down.
It's about to get really warm in here.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.206
Hey. You with me?

32:04.280 --> 32:06.089
The guys are out already.
They took the drug up to Skye.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.731
No. Don't give it to her.
The drug! They can't give it to her!

32:08.800 --> 32:10.040
All right. You tell her yourself.

32:10.120 --> 32:11.360
Right now we just need to get out
of this mountain

32:11.440 --> 32:13.841
and off the ground. Now, let's go!

32:19.320 --> 32:20.606
We found it.

32:21.480 --> 32:24.290
What is it? And how much?
Injected where?

32:24.360 --> 32:27.489
May, get us off the ground
or it'll fall out from under us.

33:01.320 --> 33:02.651
No! Don't give it to her!

33:05.800 --> 33:08.087
I was losing her anyway.
What harm can it do?

33:10.040 --> 33:12.042
Come on, girl.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.207
It's working.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.610
- She's spiking!

33:26.880 --> 33:29.247
Stop it!
How can we stop it? Skye!

33:30.880 --> 33:33.167
- What's happening?
-I don't know.

33:33.280 --> 33:34.327
Skye!

33:34.400 --> 33:36.687
Do something!
We have to do something!

33:46.520 --> 33:48.761
Her heartbeat.
She's stabilizing.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.566
Simmons?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.768
Can someone tell me what we just saw?

33:57.920 --> 33:59.126
Girl's a fighter.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.285
What was that stuff you just gave her?

34:06.360 --> 34:08.761
I don't know. All I know is that it worked.

34:11.120 --> 34:12.929
You're a real miracle worker.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.481
You did it.

34:32.360 --> 34:34.123
Something happen down there?

34:34.600 --> 34:36.125
I'm not sure.

34:36.600 --> 34:39.444
One minute he was fine,
the next it was like he'd seen a ghost.

34:45.280 --> 34:48.329
I have good news and bad news.
Which would you like to hear first?

34:51.040 --> 34:53.440
Bad news then. There's a fair amount.

34:53.520 --> 34:56.922
Your Clairvoyant, the one
who said he'd have your back?

34:57.000 --> 34:58.650
He's a no-show.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.451
The site we were supposed
to lead him to with our minds?

35:01.520 --> 35:04.444
Blown to pieces,
buried under 100 feet of rock.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.285
Seems the only psychic power

35:06.360 --> 35:09.250
your buddy has shown
is the ability to predict

35:09.320 --> 35:12.608
if you tell a rich, entitled dirtbag
he's gonna get away with murder,

35:12.680 --> 35:13.727
he'll believe it.

35:14.400 --> 35:15.481
Trip.

35:16.680 --> 35:17.966
Girl's gonna live.

35:18.480 --> 35:21.563
Live to testify how a billionaire
shot her point blank in the stomach.

35:21.680 --> 35:25.321
Oh, we got a great little home movie
of you admitting that, genius.

35:26.640 --> 35:30.247
This Clairvoyant played you
and left you to rot.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.809
You said there was good news.

35:33.880 --> 35:35.769
I did? Oh, yeah.

35:35.840 --> 35:37.444
You still have your tongue.

35:38.960 --> 35:40.371
Let's go.

35:49.360 --> 35:53.251
I wanna thank you, Garrett, for letting us
keep Quinn on the plane.

35:53.320 --> 35:54.606
Don't mention it.

35:54.680 --> 35:58.321
There's still time for me to make
the rest of his life a long living hell.

35:58.400 --> 35:59.367
I'm counting on it.

35:59.440 --> 36:02.284
- Something I need to ask you, Phil.
-Of course.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.885
We've known each other a long time.

36:03.960 --> 36:05.086
Yes, we have.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.401
Been in our share
of tight spots together.

36:07.480 --> 36:10.370
If it had gone the other way.
If Skye hadn't survived,

36:10.480 --> 36:13.927
were you really prepared
to throw Quinn off this plane?

36:15.160 --> 36:17.686
You were the one who made that threat.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.808
I just asked to keep him
on the plane for a while.

36:20.560 --> 36:24.326
You're right. It was me. My mistake.

36:24.680 --> 36:26.284
Until next time.

36:26.400 --> 36:28.687
Might be sooner than you think.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.443
My man Trip's got eyes
for that biotech gal of yours.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.047
Do you mind?

36:52.280 --> 36:54.362
You did the impossible today.

36:55.520 --> 36:57.841
You saved Skye's life.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.563
Why aren't you happy about it?

37:07.480 --> 37:12.486
They told me you were yelling
to not use the drug.

37:12.680 --> 37:14.648
To not use it on Skye. Why?

37:15.920 --> 37:18.207
What made you change your mind?

38:34.640 --> 38:36.563
Phil?

38:36.640 --> 38:38.563
Phil, you all right?

38:40.560 --> 38:43.086
Being down there,

38:43.920 --> 38:47.003
seeing where I came from,

38:47.920 --> 38:51.720
I just got really scared
that she would suffer the way that I did.

38:56.360 --> 38:58.283
But she didn't.

38:59.840 --> 39:03.970
For whatever reason, she didn't.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.242
I'm gonna
go see if they have a map.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.926
I'll be waiting in the car,
Mrs. MacKenzie.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.568
- Are you okay?
- No.

40:18.880 --> 40:20.928
No, I'm parched and weary.

40:21.480 --> 40:24.051
Is all of Midgard so desolate?

40:24.120 --> 40:26.771
Midgard? I don't know where that is.

40:26.840 --> 40:28.251
This is Death Valley.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.247
Oh.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.810
I seek passage from this valley of death

40:33.880 --> 40:35.564
to a more bountiful land.

40:35.640 --> 40:38.007
I wish I could help, but...

40:39.160 --> 40:40.286
It's built for two.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.960
You should ask the manager inside.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.610
Maybe there's a bus later today.

40:47.920 --> 40:49.160
She's your bride?

40:49.240 --> 40:51.481
Yep. Since yesterday morning.

40:52.800 --> 40:55.087
And you prefer her to me?

40:56.400 --> 40:59.131
Well, yeah.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.680
I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.649
That's why I married her.

41:04.640 --> 41:06.324
Together forever.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.610
Loyalty.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.128
I admire that in a man.

41:23.080 --> 41:27.563
I am going to need your help
if I am to remain free.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.846
Jimmy!

41:41.200 --> 41:43.680
I swear to protect you
and keep you safe.

41:45.040 --> 41:47.042
But I don't even know your name.

41:50.080 --> 41:51.650
It's Lorelei.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.728
My name is Lorelei.
