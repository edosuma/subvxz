01:18.682 --> 01:19.747
<i>You know, Fred, I always</i>

01:21.652 --> 01:22.882

01:22.917 --> 01:25.687
<i>There I am, mere feet</i>

01:25.722 --> 01:27.788

01:30.232 --> 01:33.233

<i>All good in Albany, ladies,</i>

03:12.499 --> 03:14.664
<i> Well, I pulled</i>

03:14.699 --> 03:16.270

03:16.305 --> 03:17.436
<i>Mornin' over there yet?</i>

03:17.471 --> 03:19.405
<i>No, it's all dark here.</i>

03:19.440 --> 03:20.736

<i> How about you, Sally?</i>
<i>Hey,</i> chiquita,<i> you still there?</i>

03:37.458 --> 03:41.658
Yeah, still here.
I got a beautiful day here.

03:41.693 --> 03:43.792
Heading east to 61.

03:43.827 --> 03:45.695
<i>Good to have you back, chica.</i>

03:45.730 --> 03:49.303
<i> Oh, shut up, Pattie.</i>
<i>She's Canadian, not Mexican.</i>

03:49.338 --> 03:51.668
<i> She talks weird.</i>
<i>That's all I know.</i>

03:51.703 --> 03:55.804
Okay, you're giving me shit,
you motherfuckers.

03:55.839 --> 03:58.642
- <i> Oh, yeah. You got it.</i>

03:58.677 --> 04:00.644
<i>You pickin' up</i>
<i>your brother today?</i>

04:00.679 --> 04:03.548
<i> No, Thursday.</i>
<i>Come on, Dolly.</i>

04:03.583 --> 04:05.781
<i>She ain't been talking</i>
<i>about anything else for weeks.</i>

04:05.816 --> 04:07.684
<i> Do he talk weird</i>
<i>like you, Sally?</i>

04:07.719 --> 04:10.390
Well, Dolly, fuck you very much.

04:10.425 --> 04:13.921
<i> Shut it.</i>
<i>You know he came down here</i>
<i>when he was real little.</i>

04:13.956 --> 04:15.758
<i>Sally came later.</i>

04:15.793 --> 04:17.826
<i> Yeah, right.</i>
<i>That's what fucked her up.</i>

04:17.861 --> 04:19.960
<i>No, that's what fucked him up.</i>

04:19.995 --> 04:23.062
Fuck you, too.
Okay, drivers. Gotta go.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.636
<i> Bye now.</i>
<i>Be safe. Safe.</i>

04:25.671 --> 04:27.473
- <i> Safe.</i>
- Safe.

04:56.999 --> 04:59.736
- <i> Yeah?</i>
- I'm here to visit.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.578
Thank you.

05:15.820 --> 05:19.591
I missed you so much.

05:19.626 --> 05:21.461
Take your seats, please.

05:24.565 --> 05:26.565
I have not been
this excited to see you

05:26.600 --> 05:28.798
since you came down
from Quebec with Mom.

05:38.106 --> 05:40.810
Pick you up Thursday?

05:40.845 --> 05:43.142
- You better.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.979
You got the "dress-out"
in the mail, right?

05:45.014 --> 05:46.013
Yeah.

05:48.820 --> 05:52.085
It's just so weird
because, uh...

05:52.120 --> 05:54.560
you know,
you cope while you're in here

05:54.595 --> 05:57.431
and... and when
it's almost over,

05:57.466 --> 05:59.158
then you just
can't take it anymore.

06:01.734 --> 06:03.767
It's kinda like
when you have to go
to the bathroom--

06:03.802 --> 06:06.869
- You're almost there,
and the door is locked.

06:06.904 --> 06:08.068
Sit back, please.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.609
It's her.

06:13.779 --> 06:16.648
Well, I know what I want.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.653
I want you to make me that...
tart tartu.

06:21.688 --> 06:23.787
- I want you
to make a tart tartu.

06:23.822 --> 06:26.493
What was it? What was it?

06:26.528 --> 06:27.890
What's that stuff Mom made?

06:27.925 --> 06:29.661
- Tarte Tatin.
- Tarte Tatin.

06:29.696 --> 06:31.597
- Apple tart.
- I love it.

06:53.852 --> 06:56.490
- Two minutes.

06:57.757 --> 06:58.756
Thursday.

07:05.193 --> 07:08.161
What? Please, you said
that was the last time.

07:09.637 --> 07:13.133
- They asked for one more.

07:13.168 --> 07:15.168
I know, I know, I know.
I gotta get on the outside.

07:15.203 --> 07:16.708
You gotta get me on the outside.
Okay?

07:16.743 --> 07:18.512
- Just one more time.

07:18.547 --> 07:20.877
- So, last package, I promise.
- Okay.

07:20.912 --> 07:23.209
All right? We ain't bad.
We ain't bad.

07:23.244 --> 07:24.881
Listen, listen, listen.

07:24.916 --> 07:26.520
All visitors
must exit now.

07:26.555 --> 07:27.983
They're gonna fucking kill me.
Sis, you gotta get me

07:28.018 --> 07:29.820
- out of here, okay?
- Okay, yeah, yeah.

08:45.392 --> 08:47.095
Where's the package?

08:49.671 --> 08:51.935
What the fuck?

08:51.970 --> 08:54.201
You'll take her there.
Across the state line.

08:54.236 --> 08:55.609
Paul's the guy
who's gonna meet you.

08:55.644 --> 08:57.941
Come on, sweetie.

09:00.308 --> 09:01.648
Yep.

09:02.948 --> 09:07.247
No way.
No fucking way.

09:07.282 --> 09:10.987
- Excuse me?
- You don't understand.
I don't take people.

09:12.925 --> 09:16.223
Hey!
I was told I could trust you.

09:16.258 --> 09:18.632
No way I can promise
what'll happen to your brother

09:18.667 --> 09:21.294
if you don't take the girl
where she fucking needs to go!

10:02.370 --> 10:04.040
What's your name?

10:05.406 --> 10:07.241
We're not gonna talk.

12:27.449 --> 12:28.448
Paul?

12:29.924 --> 12:31.022
Yep.

12:33.356 --> 12:34.960
Come on, lady.
It's paid fo--

12:43.938 --> 12:45.399
No! Get off of me!

12:48.943 --> 12:51.977
- Fuck! Fuck! Get down!

13:41.655 --> 13:43.622
Fuck!

13:43.657 --> 13:46.262
- Shut up!

13:49.366 --> 13:54.006
Northbound...
can I get a radio check?

13:54.041 --> 13:56.206
Any bears at the weigh station?

13:57.605 --> 13:59.539
Any bears at the weigh--

13:59.574 --> 14:02.377
The fucking fuse!

14:02.412 --> 14:05.347
- Get down! Get down!
- No!

14:08.385 --> 14:11.518
They can search
the entire truck. Get down!

14:11.553 --> 14:13.388
No! Stop!

14:15.722 --> 14:18.360
Police! Police!

14:18.395 --> 14:20.065
Is that what you want?

16:19.318 --> 16:21.384
All right, kids,
run to the bathroom.

16:22.717 --> 16:24.255
We gotta get you in the back.

16:24.290 --> 16:26.488
Come on. Come on.

16:27.623 --> 16:29.128
- Come on.

16:31.198 --> 16:32.494
Stop!

16:35.829 --> 16:38.203
- No! No!
- Come on!

16:38.238 --> 16:40.733
- Shh.

16:40.768 --> 16:43.670
- Let's go, guys.
Come on. Hurry--

16:47.346 --> 16:49.313
You're gonna miss
Nia's birthday.

17:57.185 --> 17:58.811
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.

18:03.488 --> 18:06.159
- In, in, in, in.
Quick, quick.

18:09.197 --> 18:10.427
Seatbelts.

18:39.293 --> 18:41.194
- Dennis?
- <i> I'm sorry.</i>

18:41.229 --> 18:43.493
<i>Took some time to get</i>
<i>a burner phone. You okay?</i>

18:43.528 --> 18:46.496
- It was a girl, Dennis.
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

18:46.531 --> 18:50.599
Young. Ten, 12 maybe.

18:50.634 --> 18:52.370
<i>Wait, what, what?</i>
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

18:52.405 --> 18:54.438
The fucking package was a girl.

18:56.002 --> 19:00.279
<i>What? Oh, fuck.</i>
<i>What did you do?</i>

19:01.480 --> 19:03.249
She shot the guy.

19:03.284 --> 19:04.811
With your shotgun.

19:04.846 --> 19:08.716
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Is he dead?</i>

19:09.752 --> 19:11.686
I don't know. I think so. I--

19:11.721 --> 19:15.921
<i>Oh, we're so fucked.</i>
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

19:15.956 --> 19:18.528
<i>- What-what are you hauling?</i>
- Unloading in Oxford.

19:18.563 --> 19:20.530
Got another taking me
to Jackson. That's it.

19:20.565 --> 19:21.927
<i>Okay, all right,</i>
<i>you just listen.</i>

19:21.962 --> 19:23.731
<i>Just seem--</i>
<i>just seem regular, you know.</i>

19:23.766 --> 19:25.865
<i>Just finish</i>
<i>whatever bookings you got.</i>

19:25.900 --> 19:27.933
Are you gonna be okay?

19:27.968 --> 19:29.803
<i>You're in danger, sis.</i>

19:29.838 --> 19:32.608
<i>These guys have eyes</i>
<i>all over the fucking state.</i>

19:34.007 --> 19:36.678
And the girl...
where do I drop the girl?

19:36.713 --> 19:38.779
<i>I don't know, I don't know.</i>
<i>You just gotta take her--</i>
<i>take her with you.</i>

19:38.814 --> 19:40.583
- What?
-<i> I-I don't know.</i>

19:40.618 --> 19:43.784
No! No way she can
stay in my truck.

19:43.819 --> 19:45.885
<i>She's the only thing</i>
<i>keepin' us safe.</i>

20:43.516 --> 20:47.419
Hey, beautiful.
- Fuck off! Motherfucker!

22:37.157 --> 22:38.959
He just...

22:39.995 --> 22:42.028
He exploded.

23:43.597 --> 23:45.223
This is your guy, right?

23:45.258 --> 23:49.865
Fuck. Yeah,
I took him down a half year ago

23:49.900 --> 23:53.066
when we busted
the MacDougal traffic ring.

23:53.101 --> 23:57.037
Low level sergeant,
oversaw one of the routes.

23:59.074 --> 24:01.679
- He's out already?
- Out on bond.

24:03.078 --> 24:05.716
Pictures of those girls
still haunt the web.

24:07.951 --> 24:10.182
Shell casings? Prints?

24:10.217 --> 24:12.558
Fingerprints
only from the victim.

24:13.891 --> 24:16.155
They ended him with a slug.

24:17.895 --> 24:20.126
- Nasty choice for a hit job.
- Hmm.

24:20.161 --> 24:22.161
Other slug's
in that tree over there.

24:23.604 --> 24:26.132
And you're retired
for how long now?

24:28.037 --> 24:30.169
Consultant Gerick
at your service.

24:30.204 --> 24:34.646
So, who's your new assistant?

24:34.681 --> 24:36.846
Ah, desk rat from legal.

24:36.881 --> 24:40.718
Wants field experience.
Went to Yale.

24:40.753 --> 24:42.951
I heard they have a very good
English department.

24:42.986 --> 24:44.590
Mm.

24:47.254 --> 24:48.693
Strange.

24:50.356 --> 24:51.322
Paul came here

24:51.357 --> 24:53.632
to pick up a girl

24:53.667 --> 24:56.327
who'd been transported
across the state line.

24:56.362 --> 24:58.571
His normal routine.
But then...

25:00.135 --> 25:02.135
Why?

25:02.170 --> 25:04.676
It's what we're
trying to figure out.

25:04.711 --> 25:07.712
We got wider and deeper tracks
from the second vehicle.

25:07.747 --> 25:09.010
It's probably a truck.

25:09.045 --> 25:13.113
Yeah. Refrigerated trailer
or dry van.

25:13.148 --> 25:15.346
No tarp.

25:15.381 --> 25:19.658
All right, well,
start by alerting
the weigh stations, Finley.

25:19.693 --> 25:22.628
Excuse me, Gerick. Just, please,
call me by my last name.

25:22.663 --> 25:25.092
- All right, Yale.
- Sterling.

25:25.127 --> 25:27.699
You gonna make those calls
or you gonna write a poem
about it?

25:29.098 --> 25:31.230
I'll make the calls.
Just, please, call me Sterling.

25:31.265 --> 25:32.803
Yeah.

25:55.861 --> 25:58.224
Never seen you so lazy,
Ms. Sally.

25:58.259 --> 25:59.995
Sorry, Frank, got a bad knee.

26:01.966 --> 26:03.295
You got a lover in there, huh?

26:03.330 --> 26:05.198
Always.

26:05.233 --> 26:09.774
Uh-huh. Well, you ready to roll.

27:04.897 --> 27:06.061
Take these out to the car.

27:06.096 --> 27:07.458
- Whoa.

27:07.493 --> 27:10.131
- Come on, come on.
- Fine.

27:10.166 --> 27:11.330
All right.

27:11.365 --> 27:13.365
Hey, so, State Police

27:13.400 --> 27:15.070
are doing us a favor
on the weigh stations,

27:15.105 --> 27:16.940
and we got a match
on the muddy tire tracks

27:16.975 --> 27:18.370
headed onto
the south highway entrance.

27:18.405 --> 27:19.943
So Mississippi, not Tennessee.

27:19.978 --> 27:22.044
- And--
- Here.

27:22.079 --> 27:24.475
Yeah, Gerick,
I'm not your assistant.

27:24.510 --> 27:27.412
This is my case,
and I appreciate having you
on as a consultant,

27:27.447 --> 27:29.447
but right now, we just need you
to sign this, and then--

27:29.482 --> 27:31.449
We start with files
from last year.

27:31.484 --> 27:34.287
I'll bet he was whacked by
one of his little buddies.

27:34.322 --> 27:37.290
We take a look at
all known associates.

27:37.325 --> 27:40.260
Find out which one
might've had a beef with Paul.

27:40.295 --> 27:42.262
And we're looking for a girl.
One.

27:42.297 --> 27:44.495
He always bought 'em
one at a time.

27:44.530 --> 27:47.234
Yeah, so we just need you
to sign this report
for headquarters.

27:47.269 --> 27:50.039
- No time for bureaucracy, Yale.

27:50.074 --> 27:53.339
I think you're taking this
a bit too personally, sir.

27:53.374 --> 27:55.880
- Excuse me?
- I think you heard me.

27:59.446 --> 28:01.182
All right. We're taking my car.

28:01.217 --> 28:04.416
And let me know where
we're at with that cell phone.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.028
Okay, so we
did crack Paul's phone.

28:12.063 --> 28:14.261
It wasn't easy.
With recent numbers
already being dead,

28:14.296 --> 28:16.131
we couldn't trace it,
and no registered address.

28:16.166 --> 28:17.803
But he did pay for
the phone bill
with a credit card

28:17.838 --> 28:20.366
that also paid the utilities
at an address.

28:20.401 --> 28:22.973
Good lung capacity there,
Yale.

28:23.008 --> 28:25.041
What is that,
Ivy League swim team?

28:25.076 --> 28:26.977
I put in a request
for a warrant.

28:27.012 --> 28:29.012
- Ah, we're not
waiting for that.
- Gerick.

28:32.083 --> 28:33.280
Something's not right.

28:34.888 --> 28:36.547
Paul should've called by now.

28:50.596 --> 28:52.035
Go back to your room!

29:08.218 --> 29:10.482
Be smart.
Stay in the back.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.551
Don't let anybody see you, okay?

30:03.372 --> 30:06.604
Hey! Hey, you! Hey!

30:12.953 --> 30:14.612
- Who's that girl?

30:14.647 --> 30:17.054
What the fuck are you doing?
- Goddamnit!

30:17.089 --> 30:20.354
Does anyone care
that I am working next door?

30:28.628 --> 30:30.496
All right.

30:33.336 --> 30:37.437
Okay. Let's get goin'.

30:46.646 --> 30:48.448
I always move the truck

30:48.483 --> 30:51.517
after being seen
outside of this truck stop.

30:51.552 --> 30:54.190
Worst reputation on the road.

30:57.657 --> 31:00.900
Hmm. My brother. He's good.

31:02.002 --> 31:04.563
Champ. He'll help.

31:20.086 --> 31:21.415
You got a brother?

31:23.353 --> 31:24.583
Sisters?

31:32.131 --> 31:34.967
Guess you don't have
no mom or dad either, huh?

31:35.002 --> 31:37.266
What are you? Baby Jesus?

31:39.534 --> 31:40.973
What's your name?

31:43.670 --> 31:44.977
Leila.

31:45.012 --> 31:46.077
Leila.

31:48.774 --> 31:50.609
<i> And that was the</i>
<i>farmer who found the body</i>

31:50.644 --> 31:53.513
<i>- on a muddy back road off 25.</i>
- Mm-hm. I see it.

31:53.548 --> 31:55.680
<i>- Less than a mile north</i>
<i>of the state border.</i>
Yeah.

31:55.715 --> 31:58.584
<i>A brutal killing</i>
<i>that's hard to grapple with.</i>

31:58.619 --> 32:01.620
<i>- How did it happen and why?</i>
- That little girl's
gonna tell on us.

32:01.655 --> 32:04.326
No one's gonna tell on nobody.

32:04.361 --> 32:08.033
<i> The once quiet</i>
<i>community is coming to terms</i>
<i>with what's happened</i>

32:08.068 --> 32:11.168
<i>as the motive remains unclear</i>
<i>in the Mud Murder.</i>

32:11.203 --> 32:14.501
<i>What would warrant</i>
<i>such a violent end</i>
<i>to a person's life?</i>

32:14.536 --> 32:16.338
<i>Law enforcement is questioning</i>

32:16.373 --> 32:18.472
<i>- the use of slugs...</i>
- Fuck me. Who leaked?

32:18.507 --> 32:20.375
<i>- ...a particularly</i>
<i>damaging bullet.</i>
Not me.

32:20.410 --> 32:22.509
<i>It's a most unusual find</i>
<i>at the crime scene.</i>

32:22.544 --> 32:26.315
Some lonesome cowboy
wanting his 15 minutes of fame.

32:26.350 --> 32:27.613
<i>...police are</i>
<i>looking into the manner.</i>

32:27.648 --> 32:29.285
<i>And this, for now,</i>
<i>is all we know</i>

32:29.320 --> 32:30.748
<i>about the innocent victim.</i>

32:30.783 --> 32:32.585
Innocent, my ass.

32:32.620 --> 32:34.719
<i>As the investigation proceeds,</i>

32:34.754 --> 32:36.655
<i>no stone will be left unturned.</i>

32:36.690 --> 32:38.558
You can go to the police,

32:38.593 --> 32:41.429
tell 'em what he
would've done to you.

32:43.103 --> 32:45.136
That it was self-defense.

32:47.239 --> 32:48.405
Hmm?

32:48.440 --> 32:50.636
<i> ...is where</i>
<i>the crime took place,</i>

32:50.671 --> 32:52.638
<i>spreading fear on what...</i>

32:52.673 --> 32:54.805
Just don't bite and kick 'em,
all right?

32:54.840 --> 32:58.050
<i>...still hiding in the woods.</i>

32:58.085 --> 32:59.414
<i>It's not yet confirmed...</i>

32:59.449 --> 33:02.417
I don't like the police.

33:02.452 --> 33:06.355
<i>...but it is confirmed that</i>
<i>the manhunt covers both states.</i>

33:18.765 --> 33:22.371
You crying 'cause you're scared,
or you crying 'cause
that piece of shit is dead?

33:26.245 --> 33:28.476
You know, Leila,
you might have shot him,

33:28.511 --> 33:30.577
but I left him there to die.

33:33.153 --> 33:36.055
- We're in this together.

33:46.859 --> 33:49.431
Oh, we can't
cross state lines.

33:49.466 --> 33:51.664
It's too risky
with the weigh stations.

33:54.636 --> 33:56.636
Mm-mm.

33:56.671 --> 33:59.606
I'll get us to a place
where we can't be found.

33:59.641 --> 34:03.511
We'll wait there
till my brother has a plan.

34:23.302 --> 34:26.171
Yes, Patterson, yes.
I know, I know.

34:26.206 --> 34:29.174
You have to see the girl
in order for me
to get the warrant,

34:29.209 --> 34:32.177
even if I need the warrant
to get the fucking girl!

34:35.182 --> 34:36.874
You know, we might
still be able to get it.

34:36.909 --> 34:39.712
I'm afraid the idiots at legal
disagree with you, Yale.

34:39.747 --> 34:41.813
All right, well,
I used to work there, so--

34:41.848 --> 34:45.355
I know that. You're the idiot
who refused to issue the warrant

34:45.390 --> 34:48.457
that would've kept Paul
from getting out on bond!

35:29.236 --> 35:32.765
Okay. My buddy caught a glimpse
of a young girl

35:32.800 --> 35:35.603
poking her head out of
a blue Peterbilt yesterday.

35:35.638 --> 35:38.573
Said the truck
was headed south on 49.

35:38.608 --> 35:40.740
Called some of our friends
down there to be on the lookout.

35:48.486 --> 35:49.881
<i>Can't hate 'em much.</i>

35:49.916 --> 35:52.257
<i>Give me extra time off</i>
<i>when I got my daughter.</i>

35:52.292 --> 35:54.424
<i>'Cause we all know</i>
<i>34 hours ain't much.</i>

35:54.459 --> 35:56.591
<i> Yeah, I just</i>
<i>sleep and fuck through 'em.</i>

35:56.626 --> 35:58.527
- <i> Hey, Sally.</i>

35:58.562 --> 36:00.562
<i>Headin' to Louisville</i>
<i>anytime soon?</i>

36:00.597 --> 36:02.663
Nope, not any time soon.

36:02.698 --> 36:04.962
<i>Yeah, can't go far from Utica.</i>

36:04.997 --> 36:07.602
- That's right.
- <i> No shame in that.</i>

36:07.637 --> 36:10.671
<i>I only ran local</i>
<i>'round New York when my beau</i>
<i>was at Sing Sing.</i>

36:10.706 --> 36:13.674
<i>It's her brother, Dolly.</i>
- <i> Beau, brother.</i>

36:13.709 --> 36:17.546
<i>Only difference is one's gonna</i>
<i>cheat on ya and not the other.</i>

36:18.879 --> 36:22.320
- Very funny.
- <i> Come on, Sal.</i>

36:22.355 --> 36:25.587
<i>What's going on with</i>
<i>the two-syllable responses?</i>

36:25.622 --> 36:28.018
Uh, sorry, Pattie,
been having a rough time.

36:28.053 --> 36:29.657
<i> Wanna tell us about it?</i>

36:29.692 --> 36:31.692
<i> I got 500 miles</i>
<i>of windshield time</i>

36:31.727 --> 36:33.331
<i>and nothin' to do.</i>

36:33.366 --> 36:35.465
<i> It's okay</i>
<i>to ask for help, Sally,</i>

36:35.500 --> 36:37.830
<i>we're just a phone call away.</i>

36:37.865 --> 36:41.966
Maybe later.
All right, ladies, drive safe.

36:42.001 --> 36:43.539
- <i> Safe.</i>
- <i> Safe.</i>

36:43.574 --> 36:44.672
<i> Safe.</i>

37:51.642 --> 37:53.037
Florida is a dump.

37:55.547 --> 37:57.943
I don't care if it's a dump
when you can go
wherever you want.

37:57.978 --> 38:00.847
Where do you wanna go?
Walmart?

38:02.521 --> 38:04.455
No. The ocean.

38:04.886 --> 38:06.050
Oh.

38:08.626 --> 38:10.659
'Cause the ocean
goes everywhere.

38:24.411 --> 38:26.070
Hey, stop that! Stop that!

38:26.105 --> 38:30.547
- That's dangerous.
It's dangerous.

38:30.582 --> 38:32.879
Who the fuck cares?
It feels good.

39:17.464 --> 39:20.564
The neighbor said she saw girls
walking in and out of the house.

39:20.599 --> 39:23.963
"Maybe should've
called someone," she says,
but doesn't wanna get involved.

39:23.998 --> 39:26.603
- Hm.
- I can't believe people
are like this.

39:26.638 --> 39:30.772
Well, write a poem about it.

39:30.807 --> 39:32.543
Isn't that what you do at Yale?

39:32.578 --> 39:35.139
No.
Sometimes we write essays.

39:35.174 --> 39:38.043
Well, get her statement.

39:38.078 --> 39:39.077
On it.

39:39.684 --> 39:40.947
Ma'am!

39:42.621 --> 39:43.917
One second.

39:49.122 --> 39:50.957
All right, Patterson.
We got what you need.

39:52.664 --> 39:55.093
<i>I'm worried about you, sis.</i>

39:55.128 --> 39:56.699
<i>You should</i>
<i>find a place to hide.</i>

39:56.734 --> 39:58.668
<i>One of the--</i>
<i>one of those big truck stops.</i>

39:58.703 --> 40:01.836
- I know a place we can hide.
<i>- Okay, good.</i>

40:01.871 --> 40:03.574
<i>You don't think</i>
<i>you've been spotted yet, right?</i>

40:03.609 --> 40:05.642
- No.
<i>- Good. Good.</i>

40:05.677 --> 40:07.479
- No.
-<i> All right. All right.</i>

40:07.514 --> 40:09.140
<i>So-so, you'll hide overnight</i>

40:09.175 --> 40:11.945
<i>and then you make your way</i>
<i>to Arkansas tomorrow.</i>

40:11.980 --> 40:14.211
- Arkansas?
<i>- You'll be safer there.</i>

40:14.246 --> 40:16.213
But I'm pickin' you up
in Utica tomorrow.

40:16.248 --> 40:19.524
<i>No, you can't do that.</i>
<i>Not with the load</i>
<i>you're carrying.</i>

40:20.824 --> 40:22.626
But I wanna be there
when you get out.

40:22.661 --> 40:23.858
<i>I know, I know.</i>

40:23.893 --> 40:26.223
<i>That was the plan,</i>
<i>but it's not safe, sis.</i>

40:26.258 --> 40:28.258
<i>These guys</i>
<i>aren't fucking around.</i>

40:28.293 --> 40:31.767
Okay. Okay, so what do I do?

40:33.067 --> 40:35.199
Get across the border
and meet you?

40:35.234 --> 40:37.135
Where?

40:37.170 --> 40:39.577
<i>At home.</i>

40:39.612 --> 40:41.546
- Home?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

40:41.581 --> 40:44.582
I'm not going back home, Dennis.

40:44.617 --> 40:46.749
I haven't been there
since I was 15, I...

40:46.784 --> 40:48.784
I can't go back.

40:48.819 --> 40:50.852
<i>Dad's dead.</i>

40:50.887 --> 40:53.019
I know,
I paid for his fucking casket.

40:53.054 --> 40:57.188
- I'm not going.
<i>- It's the only safe place</i>
<i>I know, I'm sorry.</i>

40:57.223 --> 40:59.256
<i>Shit, someone--</i>
<i>someone's coming.</i>

40:59.291 --> 41:01.027
<i>- I-I gotta go.</i>

41:19.883 --> 41:21.586
We found a dog
in the basement.

41:21.621 --> 41:23.654
We need a few minutes
to tranquilize it.

41:23.689 --> 41:25.315
Okay.

41:25.350 --> 41:26.789
Saunders?

41:42.004 --> 41:44.873
Neighbors say they saw the girls
walking around the neighborhood.

41:48.010 --> 41:49.108
I don't understand.

41:49.143 --> 41:52.815
Why didn't they...
call the police?

41:52.850 --> 41:56.016
Ask for help? Something.

41:56.051 --> 42:00.119
These kids have been
fucked over by the system
since the day they were born.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.221
They don't call the police.

42:04.730 --> 42:07.027
Nobody gives a shit
and they know it.

42:09.031 --> 42:13.198
They also know that
if they step out of line
what happens.

42:14.333 --> 42:16.333
That's what the basement is for.

42:35.189 --> 42:38.388
- A kid had been in this cage.
- What?

42:38.423 --> 42:42.227
A kid had been in this cage.
Bolted to the wall.

42:43.868 --> 42:46.066
Dog was running loose.

42:46.101 --> 42:47.364
From the looks of the dog,

42:47.399 --> 42:49.333
it had been trained
to be aggressive.

42:49.368 --> 42:51.742
Traces of blood on the bolts.

42:53.405 --> 42:56.846
Looks like someone
tried to claw their way out.

42:56.881 --> 42:58.914
Fresh. Couple of days.

42:58.949 --> 43:00.883
We just missed them.

43:00.918 --> 43:02.346
Clothes in the cage.

43:02.381 --> 43:04.216
Pant size, dress size.

43:04.251 --> 43:07.285
She's probably about five feet.
Young.

43:07.320 --> 43:09.925
And she found a pencil
to doodle with.

43:46.733 --> 43:48.194
You know this place?

44:04.410 --> 44:06.311
This truck stop's so big...

44:08.084 --> 44:10.282
even the pimps
don't know their way around.

44:10.317 --> 44:12.416
We can hide here till tomorrow.

44:25.068 --> 44:26.232
Okay.

44:29.006 --> 44:30.808
Let's go over the ground rules.

44:35.782 --> 44:38.717
Hair spray,
AKA pepper spray.

44:40.182 --> 44:41.214
Here.

44:43.185 --> 44:46.219
Man's coat stays on
the driver's seat.

44:46.254 --> 44:47.759
Makes them think
a guy lives here.

44:48.927 --> 44:53.391
At night,
curtains closed, lights off.

44:53.426 --> 44:56.097
Lights on is an invitation.
Right?

44:56.132 --> 44:58.902
Someone knocks, we don't open.

44:58.937 --> 45:01.036
Doors locked. Windows up.

45:01.071 --> 45:04.776
Seatbelt wrapped through
the door handle

45:04.811 --> 45:07.878
and fastened
when we're sleepin'.

45:09.409 --> 45:12.883
You sleep up top.
I'm on the bottom. Got it?

45:12.918 --> 45:15.083
- Got it.
- I do the shoppin'.

45:15.118 --> 45:17.415
But you do the dishes.
You stay here.

45:17.450 --> 45:19.956
Don't let nobody see you, okay?

45:19.991 --> 45:21.760
- All right.
- That's it.

45:26.327 --> 45:27.931
But I need to go to the store.

45:27.966 --> 45:29.900
Uh, didn't you hear what I said?

45:29.935 --> 45:32.034
Your underwear is huge on me.

45:32.069 --> 45:34.773
Would you prefer me
to walk around
with 'em gathered in my ass?

45:41.309 --> 45:42.440
This it?

45:42.475 --> 45:44.948
It's for my niece.

45:44.983 --> 45:47.346
Well, how do you like that?

45:47.381 --> 45:50.855
I see you more than
I see my own family,

45:50.890 --> 45:53.451
and I didn't even know
you had a niece.

46:03.001 --> 46:08.235
Oh, come on, Patterson,
don't give me this shit about
priority of resources, man.

46:08.270 --> 46:12.107
This is a fucking priority.
Fuck!

46:21.646 --> 46:23.349
Fuck!

46:23.384 --> 46:24.823
- Yeah.
- Fuck!

46:27.421 --> 46:30.961
You've been at this, what,
30, 40 years?

46:31.964 --> 46:33.062
Fifty.

46:35.231 --> 46:36.967
Still gets you riled up, huh?

46:37.970 --> 46:39.904
How the hell can it not?

46:45.043 --> 46:46.471
Why don't they run?

46:48.574 --> 46:52.312
You know? Because I would.

46:52.347 --> 46:54.380
Anything to get away
from that hellhole.

46:54.415 --> 46:58.516
Fuck no. You--
you'd be locked in a basement.

47:01.323 --> 47:05.061
No, you wouldn't run.
You'd stay.

47:06.361 --> 47:10.627
Try to play the game.
Survive.

47:12.939 --> 47:14.433
What the fuck would you
live on out there?

47:14.468 --> 47:16.501
Grass? Clover?

47:18.010 --> 47:19.109
Best case scenario,

47:19.145 --> 47:21.605
you're found and brought
right back into the system.

47:21.640 --> 47:23.475
Then you'd run again.

47:28.350 --> 47:29.613
Sorry.

47:32.684 --> 47:35.058
Most of these kids
are held captive

47:35.093 --> 47:38.160
just a few miles
from where they grew up.

47:38.195 --> 47:40.624
In their minds
they got nowhere to go.

47:43.332 --> 47:45.937
And for a lot of 'em,
that's true.

47:50.273 --> 47:51.635
Same hair
as in the basement.

47:53.540 --> 47:54.913
Thank you.

48:16.596 --> 48:18.695
Shouldn't we get--
shouldn't we get rid of that?

48:18.730 --> 48:23.172
Not an option. My mom gave it
to my brother before she died.

48:24.241 --> 48:27.011
They find this...

48:27.046 --> 48:28.540
they've found us anyway.

48:31.578 --> 48:33.479
You fire it, you clean it.

48:48.496 --> 48:50.430
I see his eyes all the time.

48:52.566 --> 48:55.072
You kill someone
'cause you wanna be free,

48:56.075 --> 48:57.734
but then he still gets you.

49:00.409 --> 49:02.211
How'd you learn to shoot?

49:09.616 --> 49:11.088
This guy Cooper.

49:12.685 --> 49:15.125
My mom left me with him
when she went to work.

49:16.359 --> 49:18.425
He was buildin' an armory.

49:20.792 --> 49:25.135
He always said
if the world went to shit...
he'd be ready.

50:08.840 --> 50:10.576
Do you ever feel lonely?

50:12.481 --> 50:13.645
Always.

50:52.323 --> 50:53.718
Just a few gallons of gas.

50:53.753 --> 50:55.126
- Oh, you want gas?
- Please, lady.

50:55.161 --> 50:57.293
Well, bring your car!
I'll give you some gas.

50:57.328 --> 50:59.328
I just want a few dollars.
It'd be better so I can buy--

50:59.363 --> 51:02.496
Oh, now you want money!
Ask for money!
We're all struggling here!

51:02.531 --> 51:03.430
I just wanna
take my kids to the--

51:03.466 --> 51:05.466
You got kids?
Go take care of them.

51:08.735 --> 51:12.176
- See?
- Yeah, I see.

51:12.211 --> 51:15.443
God... And what do you
want me to do?

51:15.478 --> 51:17.907
- Well--
- Resources
are so fucking scarce,

51:17.942 --> 51:20.580
they're telling us to prioritize
only infants and toddlers.

51:20.615 --> 51:22.681
Patterson, we can
catch these fucking guys.

51:22.716 --> 51:24.914
It's you and Sterling, Gerick.
That is it.

51:24.949 --> 51:29.226
If we don't bring 'em down now,
they just set up some place else
and then what?

51:29.261 --> 51:31.228
Ten more girls?
Fifteen?

51:32.693 --> 51:34.396
Trafficking will not go away

51:34.431 --> 51:35.661
until people stop buying,
Gerick.

51:35.696 --> 51:37.663
We know that.
All right?

51:37.698 --> 51:39.533
We get these guys
and someone else

51:39.568 --> 51:41.502
is just gonna satisfy
the demand.

51:48.940 --> 51:51.182
It could be your daughter,
Patterson.

52:01.359 --> 52:04.393
Hi. I saw you earlier today.

52:04.428 --> 52:10.399
Uh, I was just wondering
if you wanted to come over.

52:10.434 --> 52:13.897
Uh, my mom's making pancakes,
so I just thought...

52:13.932 --> 52:15.668
Thanks, but I don't have time.

52:15.703 --> 52:19.177
M-maybe later? We're in
the pink RV over by the store.

52:21.709 --> 52:25.183
Okay, well, maybe later.

52:25.977 --> 52:27.746
Bye then. See ya.

53:28.578 --> 53:29.973
Wow.

53:31.845 --> 53:34.384
Who knew she
could still shine.

53:49.027 --> 53:50.565
You said he would help.

53:50.600 --> 53:53.370
You don't read
other people's letters.

53:53.405 --> 53:55.339
He's in fucking jail,
so how's he gonna help us?

53:57.871 --> 54:00.806
What do you mean? "Us"?

54:02.348 --> 54:03.908
You and me are not "us".

54:05.483 --> 54:07.912
The only "us" I know
is me and my brother.

54:12.754 --> 54:15.623
Why didn't you tell me
he was in jail?

54:15.658 --> 54:17.856
He's getting
out of jail tomorrow.

54:17.891 --> 54:20.397
'Cause of you,
I can't be there.

54:23.369 --> 54:25.402
You could've just told me.

54:25.437 --> 54:27.338
None of your fucking business.

54:49.461 --> 54:52.561
Like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

54:52.596 --> 54:54.695
A semi is no needle though.

54:54.730 --> 54:56.928
It stands out
pretty much anywhere.

55:02.133 --> 55:03.638
If I was them...

55:05.510 --> 55:09.974
I'd duck into someplace
familiar and just lay low.

55:10.009 --> 55:13.780
And a young girl with a trucker
might stand out just enough

55:13.815 --> 55:15.980
for someone
to have taken notice.

55:17.148 --> 55:19.423
- Yeah.
- Wait.

55:19.458 --> 55:21.590
You're not suggesting
we go analog

55:21.625 --> 55:23.152
and go to every
truck stop ever?

55:23.187 --> 55:25.594
- 'Cause there's--
there's many.
- There aren't that many.

55:25.629 --> 55:28.663
And a guy like this won't stray
far from his comfort zone.

55:28.698 --> 55:31.028
You're driving. Let's go.

56:57.281 --> 56:58.918
- Hello.
- <i> Oh, shit.</i>

56:58.953 --> 57:01.591
<i>I was worried about you.</i>
<i>I worked it out.</i>

57:01.626 --> 57:02.955
<i>We gotta get the girl</i>
<i>back to them,</i>

57:02.990 --> 57:04.528
<i>and they'll let us</i>
<i>off the hook.</i>

57:04.563 --> 57:06.596
<i>- Where you at?</i>
- Sherrigan's.

57:06.631 --> 57:08.730
Heading to Arkansas tomorrow
like you told me.

57:08.765 --> 57:11.260
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>
<i>Everything good there?</i>

57:11.295 --> 57:16.804
- Yeah. All's good.
<i>- Great. Okay.</i>

57:16.839 --> 57:19.906
- I love you.
-<i> I love you, too.</i>

57:19.941 --> 57:23.173
<i>Just keep the girl close.</i>
<i>She's our lifeline, sis.</i>

57:23.208 --> 57:25.142
- Yeah.
-<i> Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

57:25.177 --> 57:27.815
- Yeah.
-<i> I think we're gonna be okay.</i>

59:06.751 --> 59:07.750
Hello.

59:07.785 --> 59:08.817
Okay.

59:10.282 --> 59:11.721
All right, we're on our way.

59:12.757 --> 59:15.219
We got 'em. Take a left.

1:00:02.235 --> 1:00:05.137
All right, all right,
all right, let's see.

1:00:05.172 --> 1:00:09.372
Okay. Rock, okay.
It starts with rock.

1:00:09.407 --> 1:00:11.682
And then scissors
cuts paper.

1:00:11.717 --> 1:00:14.047
Rock, paper,
scissors, shoot.

1:00:14.819 --> 1:00:16.115
Rock, pa--

1:00:16.150 --> 1:00:18.689
Rock, paper, scissors,
gun, shoot.

1:00:18.724 --> 1:00:21.351
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

1:00:21.386 --> 1:00:23.056
- What the heck?

1:00:23.091 --> 1:00:25.421
Okay, rock, shoot.

1:00:37.809 --> 1:00:42.108
What you got there, Yale?
Toothbrush?

1:00:43.276 --> 1:00:44.880
Yeah, I drink a lot of coffee.

1:00:46.147 --> 1:00:49.720
Okay. All right.

1:00:49.755 --> 1:00:52.118
It's our fourth stop today.

1:00:52.153 --> 1:00:53.416
What's gonna be different
about this one?

1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:56.023
You wanted field work.

1:00:56.058 --> 1:00:57.926
This is the field.

1:00:57.961 --> 1:01:01.193
Sorry, it's not as sexy
as you thought it would be.

1:01:01.228 --> 1:01:03.393
Let's see what we find.

1:01:18.982 --> 1:01:20.344
Shot of whiskey.

1:01:52.312 --> 1:01:56.347
My youngest is sick and we just
need a few dollars for the bus.

1:01:56.382 --> 1:01:59.955
You have kids, right?
You know what I'm goin' through.

1:02:04.830 --> 1:02:08.898
Excuse me, sir.
I have-- I have a sick mother
at home and my car broke down.

1:02:08.933 --> 1:02:11.934
I really...
I just need a few bucks.

1:02:14.136 --> 1:02:18.875
You got kids? You got kids?
You got kids, don't you?

1:02:18.910 --> 1:02:20.437
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, baby.

1:02:29.118 --> 1:02:31.547
Thank you.
Thank you, ma'am.

1:02:31.582 --> 1:02:33.087
- Okay, now.
- Thank you.

1:02:33.122 --> 1:02:35.023
- Thank you.
- All right.

1:02:35.058 --> 1:02:36.992
Thank you.

1:02:46.135 --> 1:02:47.904
Do you ever feel lonely?

1:02:49.567 --> 1:02:52.238
Mm, no, not really.

1:02:54.209 --> 1:02:58.046
Mm, how about, like,
when you're with people?

1:03:00.116 --> 1:03:02.314
That maybe
you'll always be lonely

1:03:02.349 --> 1:03:05.856
because no one knows the world
the same as you do?

1:03:08.322 --> 1:03:09.860
Uh...

1:03:18.431 --> 1:03:20.101
I haven't seen
any little girl.

1:03:20.136 --> 1:03:22.301
I am so sure
I would've noticed that,

1:03:22.336 --> 1:03:24.501
but I only work
certain shifts.

1:03:24.536 --> 1:03:26.910
Well, what about personnel?

1:03:26.945 --> 1:03:29.110
Is there anyone
here consistently

1:03:29.145 --> 1:03:32.509
who might've noticed
something suspicious?

1:03:32.544 --> 1:03:35.050
Well, I think your best bet
might be to go over there

1:03:35.085 --> 1:03:36.546
to the bar
and talk to the bartender.

1:03:36.581 --> 1:03:38.922
He knows most everybody
coming in and outta here.

1:03:38.957 --> 1:03:41.089
And the regulars,
they're always around.

1:03:41.124 --> 1:03:42.387
Okay.

1:03:42.422 --> 1:03:44.059
<i>♪ Yeah, yeah ♪</i>

1:04:21.098 --> 1:04:23.164
Excuse me, ma'am.

1:04:23.199 --> 1:04:25.199
- Yeah.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

1:04:25.234 --> 1:04:26.596
What can I do for you...

1:04:26.631 --> 1:04:31.139
Officer Finley Sterling?

1:04:31.174 --> 1:04:32.338
Is that a real name?

1:04:32.373 --> 1:04:33.702
Some of my friends
call me Yale,

1:04:33.737 --> 1:04:36.144
if that makes things
easier for you.

1:04:36.179 --> 1:04:38.047
We're just looking for
a truck driver

1:04:38.082 --> 1:04:39.543
with a little girl with him.

1:04:39.578 --> 1:04:41.017
Huh?

1:04:41.052 --> 1:04:43.382
Uh, about five foot tall.

1:04:44.385 --> 1:04:46.088
Uh, dark brown hair.

1:04:46.123 --> 1:04:47.188
You seen anybody like that?

1:04:50.259 --> 1:04:51.588
Nope.

1:04:51.623 --> 1:04:53.392
Okay, thank you.
Have a good night.

1:04:54.197 --> 1:04:55.196
And you.

1:05:26.526 --> 1:05:28.130
Sally.

1:05:39.341 --> 1:05:40.604
- Hey.
- I'm okay.

1:05:40.639 --> 1:05:42.342
- You okay?
- Good.

1:05:42.377 --> 1:05:44.707
Okay.
Do you live around here?

1:05:44.742 --> 1:05:47.017
- No?

1:05:47.052 --> 1:05:48.150
What's your name?

1:05:49.417 --> 1:05:51.714
Okay. Let's get you
back to your truck, okay?

1:05:51.749 --> 1:05:54.057
- Yeah.
- You think you
can show us the way?

1:05:56.688 --> 1:06:00.459
Oh. Watch your step, hon.

1:06:00.494 --> 1:06:02.692
Had a little too much
to drink tonight, huh?

1:06:02.727 --> 1:06:05.530
- Happens to the best
of us, right?

1:06:20.217 --> 1:06:21.777
Which one's your truck, huh?

1:06:23.352 --> 1:06:24.351
Is it this one?

1:06:24.386 --> 1:06:26.056
All right,
let's get your keys.

1:06:26.091 --> 1:06:27.684
Where's your keys, huh?

1:06:31.393 --> 1:06:33.492
- Watch her, Tesz.
- Got her.

1:06:39.203 --> 1:06:41.401
- There's no one in here.
- What?

1:06:41.436 --> 1:06:43.205
I'm sayin' there's
no fucking girl in here.

1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:45.603
Oh, fuck. Where is she?

1:06:45.638 --> 1:06:47.308
- Huh?

1:06:47.343 --> 1:06:50.146
I said,
where the fuck is the girl?

1:06:50.181 --> 1:06:51.444
What a dump.

1:06:51.479 --> 1:06:53.116
There's nothing in here
but crap.

1:06:53.151 --> 1:06:54.711
What? You sure?

1:06:57.320 --> 1:06:59.089
What is all this shit?

1:06:59.124 --> 1:07:01.652
- What the hell is this, huh?
- Where's the girl, huh?

1:07:04.690 --> 1:07:05.689
Where the fuck is the girl?

1:07:05.725 --> 1:07:07.790
- I don't-- I don't know.
- Wake up, wake up.

1:07:07.825 --> 1:07:09.759
Wake up, get up.

1:07:09.794 --> 1:07:13.499
Show me where--

1:07:19.342 --> 1:07:21.078
Oh, shit!

1:07:23.247 --> 1:07:26.347
- What the fuck?
- She's shot a guy before.

1:07:27.845 --> 1:07:31.484
Hey, Deborah.
Get out here.

1:07:32.685 --> 1:07:34.685
What the fuck, Tesz?

1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:37.721
Shit.

1:07:37.756 --> 1:07:39.360
Hey, what's going on out there?

1:07:40.792 --> 1:07:42.627
Shut the fuck up!
I'm tryin' to sleep!

1:07:42.662 --> 1:07:44.233
Come on, Sally.

1:07:44.268 --> 1:07:46.136
- Get in the truck.

1:07:46.930 --> 1:07:47.896
Here.

1:07:50.175 --> 1:07:52.406
- Come on! Get in the truck!
- She's got a gun.

1:07:52.441 --> 1:07:53.836
Hey, careful.

1:07:56.511 --> 1:07:59.182
I'm tired of this shit.
Tryin' to sleep over here.

1:08:02.913 --> 1:08:04.220
Get the fuck outta here!

1:08:04.255 --> 1:08:05.386
You fucked up my eye, bitch.

1:08:05.421 --> 1:08:07.223
- Fuck you!
- Shut the fuck--

1:08:07.258 --> 1:08:09.786
- Hey!

1:08:09.821 --> 1:08:11.491
Get the car, get the car.

1:08:20.766 --> 1:08:22.205
- Straight out.
- Yeah.

1:08:25.705 --> 1:08:27.441
What the fuck?

1:08:27.476 --> 1:08:28.475
Is that her truck?

1:08:40.555 --> 1:08:43.160
- What the fuck?
- Is she gonna fucking hit us?

1:08:58.936 --> 1:09:00.573
Keep her there. Hold her.

1:09:02.973 --> 1:09:04.445
Again.

1:09:12.950 --> 1:09:14.785
- We need to talk to her.
- Her?

1:09:18.527 --> 1:09:21.363
It's a blue cab truck.
Keep it in sight.

1:09:25.501 --> 1:09:26.929
- You get the plates?
- Yeah.

1:09:30.440 --> 1:09:32.341
- All right.
- No!

1:09:32.376 --> 1:09:34.475
- Wait.
What the fuck are you doing?
- She's getting away!

1:09:34.510 --> 1:09:36.774
We don't wanna get into
a fucking car chase
with the police!

1:09:47.523 --> 1:09:48.786
Calm down, all right?

1:09:48.821 --> 1:09:50.590
I don't want you
to hurt yourself.

1:10:13.351 --> 1:10:14.317
Pull right.

1:10:19.423 --> 1:10:20.587
Straighten out!

1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:24.354
Fuck!

1:12:38.958 --> 1:12:40.760
<i>In other news, the police</i>

1:12:40.795 --> 1:12:41.992
<i>are still on the lookout</i>

1:12:42.027 --> 1:12:44.027
<i>for a light blue</i>
<i>Peterbilt truck</i>

1:12:44.062 --> 1:12:47.503
<i>after the incident</i>
<i>at Sherrigan's truck stop</i>
<i>last night.</i>

1:12:47.538 --> 1:12:50.407
<i>License plate F-three-one--</i>

1:12:57.042 --> 1:12:58.140
Hmm.

1:13:00.749 --> 1:13:02.947
- We should get going.
- Oh, no.

1:13:05.215 --> 1:13:07.853
Right.

1:13:09.186 --> 1:13:11.153
Can we go to this place?

1:13:14.191 --> 1:13:16.125
It's not far from here.

1:13:18.096 --> 1:13:19.832
I just wanna pick up my jacket.

1:13:26.071 --> 1:13:27.609
There ain't nobody there.

1:13:27.644 --> 1:13:31.547
So... no one's gonna see us.

1:13:33.551 --> 1:13:35.111
How the hell
can they be lost, man?

1:13:35.146 --> 1:13:37.014
They're in a blue rig.

1:13:38.050 --> 1:13:39.951
Kinda hard to miss.

1:13:39.986 --> 1:13:42.921
All the roads around here
aren't even on the map, sir.

1:13:42.956 --> 1:13:45.759
Well, get a chopper in the air,
man, for fuck's sake.

1:13:45.794 --> 1:13:47.761
You think we got a chopper
around here?

1:13:47.796 --> 1:13:49.829
Get a news chopper,
I don't care!

1:13:49.864 --> 1:13:51.193
- Weather chopper!

1:13:51.228 --> 1:13:53.503
- What?
- She's ready to talk.

1:13:57.707 --> 1:14:00.169
You know,
sometimes people help you more
if you're not an asshole.

1:14:00.204 --> 1:14:02.875
- I'm only an asshole to you.
- You're an asshole to everyone.

1:14:02.910 --> 1:14:04.580
And you.

1:14:04.615 --> 1:14:07.517
I don't work for nobody, sir.

1:14:07.552 --> 1:14:09.552
Some woman
asked if we wanted some cash.

1:14:09.587 --> 1:14:13.050
I don't know the bitch.
Don't know the trucker lady.

1:14:13.085 --> 1:14:15.789
And don't know the girl
who took a swing at me.

1:14:15.824 --> 1:14:17.626
The girl took a swing at you?

1:14:17.661 --> 1:14:20.893
Yeah. She was the one
holding the gun, too.

1:14:28.166 --> 1:14:29.869
You'll like our trailer.

1:14:29.904 --> 1:14:31.673
It's nice.

1:14:35.008 --> 1:14:37.074
Our trailer is bright blue,

1:14:37.109 --> 1:14:38.779
so you'll know it
when you see it.

1:14:40.079 --> 1:14:41.584
My mom painted it.

1:14:47.086 --> 1:14:48.690
Your friend Cooper's place?

1:14:51.024 --> 1:14:53.794
Yeah. That was his place.

1:14:56.293 --> 1:14:58.161
Our trailer-- our trailer's
right behind the pink flamingo,

1:14:58.196 --> 1:14:59.932
so you'll see it
in just a second.

1:15:24.827 --> 1:15:27.025
It was just prescriptions
at first.

1:15:30.965 --> 1:15:33.999
She only took what the fucking
doctor told her to take.

1:15:43.274 --> 1:15:46.209
I didn't wanna stay
at another group home.

1:15:49.379 --> 1:15:51.049
So I ran.

1:16:15.042 --> 1:16:16.712
My mom loved me.

1:16:26.383 --> 1:16:28.988
But that stuff made her
happy every time.

1:16:46.810 --> 1:16:50.647
You know, I've never actually
been to the ocean before.

1:16:57.216 --> 1:16:59.854
Well, you're lucky
to know where you wanna go.

1:17:01.858 --> 1:17:03.957
I only know
what I'm running from.

1:17:15.069 --> 1:17:16.101
You out?

1:17:16.136 --> 1:17:17.102
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:17:17.137 --> 1:17:18.301
<i>Finally.</i>

1:17:18.336 --> 1:17:19.302
You're at the house?

1:17:19.337 --> 1:17:21.337
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm home.</i>

1:17:21.372 --> 1:17:23.141
<i>I thought</i>
<i>you'd be here already.</i>

1:17:23.176 --> 1:17:26.243
<i>I'm so nervous, Sal,</i>
<i>about the girl, you know.</i>

1:17:26.278 --> 1:17:28.245
<i>We gotta get her</i>
<i>to them tonight.</i>

1:17:28.280 --> 1:17:30.049
<i>They're gonna let me know</i>
<i>what time.</i>

1:17:30.084 --> 1:17:32.381
<i>You promise me</i>
<i>you'll get her home.</i>

1:17:32.416 --> 1:17:35.252
<i>Oh, shit... They're-they're</i>
<i>calling me again.</i>

1:17:35.287 --> 1:17:36.924
<i>- Sal, I--</i>

1:17:50.467 --> 1:17:54.744
Dad used to beat us,
and Dennis took the brunt of it

1:17:54.779 --> 1:17:57.109
for as long as he could
to protect me.

1:17:57.144 --> 1:18:01.443
And it-- it hurt him.
It carved a piece out of him.

1:18:04.921 --> 1:18:07.449
It's my turn
to take care of him this time.

1:18:19.936 --> 1:18:22.431
<i>Joining conference now.</i>

1:18:22.466 --> 1:18:24.037
<i> Welcome, Sally.</i>

1:18:24.072 --> 1:18:26.072
<i>Didn't think you'd</i>
<i>make it on here today.</i>

1:18:26.107 --> 1:18:27.876
<i>How was it</i>
<i>pickin' up your brother?</i>

1:18:27.911 --> 1:18:31.407
Hey, ladies.
I got a favor to ask you.

1:18:31.442 --> 1:18:34.146
<i>No way! Did he fuck up already?</i>

1:18:34.181 --> 1:18:36.346
It's not for my brother.
It's for me.

1:18:42.189 --> 1:18:45.322
The truck's been sighted!
Positive match on the plates!

1:19:42.117 --> 1:19:43.281
Step out of the vehicle, ma'am.

1:19:43.316 --> 1:19:45.888
This a vehicle inspection, sir?

1:19:45.923 --> 1:19:47.549
Please step out, ma'am.

1:19:47.584 --> 1:19:48.858
All right.

1:19:58.430 --> 1:20:00.034
CDL, please.

1:20:02.005 --> 1:20:03.235
Follow me.

1:21:49.706 --> 1:21:51.277
Give me a moment, will ya?

1:21:57.054 --> 1:21:58.713
All right if I call you Sally?

1:22:01.520 --> 1:22:03.256
We're looking for a young girl.

1:22:04.754 --> 1:22:06.094
Dark hair.

1:22:07.328 --> 1:22:10.098
Thought you might've seen her.

1:22:10.133 --> 1:22:13.398
You and your partner
asked around the bar
at Sherrigan's last night.

1:22:14.335 --> 1:22:15.972
I haven't seen her, sir.

1:22:18.042 --> 1:22:20.537
What happened to your face?

1:22:20.572 --> 1:22:22.737
Didn't I tell you
I was at the bar last night?

1:22:22.772 --> 1:22:25.377
Oh.

1:22:25.412 --> 1:22:28.050
And it looks like your truck
took a beating for ya.

1:22:29.548 --> 1:22:31.350
Was she there, too?

1:22:31.385 --> 1:22:36.388
You know it, sir.
She and me, we're one.

1:22:38.095 --> 1:22:39.391
Where are you from?

1:22:40.592 --> 1:22:43.461
Nowhere, and everywhere.

1:22:44.431 --> 1:22:46.266
That's America for you.

1:22:47.434 --> 1:22:49.368
But you've been here
a long time.

1:22:52.604 --> 1:22:54.043
Where do you live?

1:22:55.277 --> 1:22:57.376
Right here, sir,
in my truck.

1:22:57.411 --> 1:23:02.150
I hear ya.
My car often becomes my bed.

1:23:02.647 --> 1:23:03.679
I don't mind.

1:23:05.089 --> 1:23:07.551
Solitude is nice.

1:23:07.586 --> 1:23:11.555
Well, sorry to bother you.
Have a nice ride.

1:23:11.590 --> 1:23:12.622
Oh, um...

1:23:14.857 --> 1:23:16.527
Where you headed?

1:23:16.562 --> 1:23:18.232
Across the river.

1:23:18.267 --> 1:23:20.168
- Arkansas?
- Arkansas.

1:23:20.203 --> 1:23:21.499
I figured.

1:23:24.504 --> 1:23:26.669
Look, Sally...

1:23:26.704 --> 1:23:31.344
there are some bad people out,
wantin' to hurt that girl.

1:23:31.379 --> 1:23:33.610
The police
are looking for a killer.

1:23:33.645 --> 1:23:36.151
That's not what I'm after.

1:23:36.186 --> 1:23:37.614
I just want to help her

1:23:37.649 --> 1:23:39.583
and whoever's
trying to be good to her.

1:23:39.618 --> 1:23:40.617
You understand?

1:23:42.852 --> 1:23:45.358
Here. This is my number.

1:23:47.725 --> 1:23:50.198
I don't trust the system
any more than you do,

1:23:51.564 --> 1:23:53.597
but some of us
are not all bad.

1:23:54.600 --> 1:23:55.665
Okay?

1:23:57.273 --> 1:24:00.637
All right.
Well, have a nice ride.

1:24:22.298 --> 1:24:23.627
Yeah.

1:24:28.238 --> 1:24:30.106
You wanna tell me
what you're not telling them?

1:24:32.638 --> 1:24:35.144
She's with the girl
all right.

1:24:35.179 --> 1:24:38.543
But that lady trucker's
not who we're looking for.

1:24:38.578 --> 1:24:40.809
I think the girl
was safe here with her.

1:24:40.844 --> 1:24:45.187
Last thing we need is a bunch
of cops running after them
with guns drawn.

1:24:46.652 --> 1:24:49.488
Oh, we'll keep an eye on her.

1:24:49.523 --> 1:24:52.458
Let her guide us to whoever
she's running away from.

1:24:54.528 --> 1:24:57.265
See, people are more helpful
if you're not an asshole.

1:25:00.270 --> 1:25:01.368
Yeah, all right.

1:25:03.273 --> 1:25:04.536
I have a call in at Utica.

1:25:05.869 --> 1:25:07.605
- Utica?
- Her brother.

1:25:09.444 --> 1:25:12.412
Petty crimes mostly,
worse up through the years.

1:25:12.447 --> 1:25:16.251
He was transporting duffels
and got caught.

1:25:16.286 --> 1:25:19.221
Five years
incarcerated at Utica.

1:25:19.256 --> 1:25:21.685
Same place
Paul McKinney did time.

1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:24.490
That's too much
of a coincidence.

1:25:24.525 --> 1:25:27.493
Her brother incarcerated
in the same place as...

1:25:28.463 --> 1:25:30.199
What do they call him?

1:25:30.234 --> 1:25:32.333
Oh, the Mud Victim.

1:25:32.368 --> 1:25:36.370
- Ah. See, that's poetry, Yale.

1:26:18.348 --> 1:26:19.512
Motherfucker.

1:26:33.627 --> 1:26:36.265
This will do.

1:26:36.300 --> 1:26:38.762
We won't get far with her
if she feels threatened.

1:26:46.871 --> 1:26:49.344
- Oh, hi.
- Hey. How you doin'?

1:26:57.486 --> 1:26:59.486
Here you go, ma'am.

1:26:59.521 --> 1:27:00.619
All right.

1:27:52.508 --> 1:27:53.639
Let's get going.

1:27:53.674 --> 1:27:54.706
Thanks, Rose.

1:27:55.676 --> 1:27:57.709
You okay, Sally?

1:27:57.744 --> 1:27:58.710
Fine.

1:27:58.745 --> 1:28:01.317
You sold your trailer?

1:28:02.848 --> 1:28:05.849
I'm gonna stay in the area, Sal.
Dolly's passin' by, too.

1:28:05.884 --> 1:28:07.851
Just so you know
in case you need anythin'.

1:28:10.856 --> 1:28:12.328
Where?

1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:15.023
He's out already?

1:28:16.598 --> 1:28:17.960
What?

1:28:17.995 --> 1:28:19.093
I'll call you back.

1:28:20.536 --> 1:28:21.799

insurance, I don't know.

1:29:53.156 --> 1:29:55.189
No, I'm not yelling at you,
David, I just--

1:29:55.224 --> 1:29:57.829
All right, just get back to me,
all right? Keep a record.

1:29:57.864 --> 1:30:01.063
Guy gave her
cash for the trailer.
Doesn't know shit about her.

1:30:01.098 --> 1:30:03.868
He got out
of the sick ward a week ago.
Taking a beating.

1:30:03.903 --> 1:30:09.170
Fuck. Fucking prisons.

1:30:09.205 --> 1:30:12.107
We lock 'em up, and we're just
creating a breeding ground.

1:30:39.873 --> 1:30:43.105
It's a long straight ball
to center field!

1:30:43.140 --> 1:30:46.075
Home run!

1:30:51.786 --> 1:30:53.280
Oh, come here.

1:30:59.090 --> 1:31:02.025
Hey. What'd they do to you?

1:31:02.060 --> 1:31:05.633
Hey. Can't you smile anymore?

1:31:13.742 --> 1:31:16.105
Oh. Oh, wow.

1:31:16.140 --> 1:31:19.174
She is-- she is really young.

1:31:21.112 --> 1:31:22.782
When do we go meet 'em?

1:31:25.083 --> 1:31:29.217
Well, they told me
bring her out to the airfield
about eleven o'clock.

1:31:38.932 --> 1:31:40.635
Here, here.

1:31:40.670 --> 1:31:42.538
Why don't you
have a seat right there?

1:31:56.653 --> 1:31:57.982
Remember that?

1:32:06.355 --> 1:32:08.157
I'm sorry
I can't get you anything.

1:32:08.192 --> 1:32:10.599
You know, nobody's been here
for the past couple of years

1:32:10.634 --> 1:32:12.293
since... since our dad died.

1:32:12.328 --> 1:32:14.064
That's fine.

1:32:33.789 --> 1:32:35.624
That. Don't you touch that.

1:32:35.659 --> 1:32:37.725
- Get your paws off my trophy.

1:32:57.010 --> 1:32:59.010
You know, I was-- I was--

1:32:59.045 --> 1:33:00.946
I was happy when you got away.

1:33:02.180 --> 1:33:03.278
- I was.
- I know.

1:33:06.987 --> 1:33:10.252
I didn't have to--
I didn't have to think about...

1:33:10.287 --> 1:33:13.321
listening to something happen
to you every night.

1:33:29.779 --> 1:33:31.845
It's not as bad as I thought.

1:33:33.717 --> 1:33:36.751
I mean, the mess is as bad
as I thought it'd be, but...

1:33:44.123 --> 1:33:45.386
It doesn't scare me anymore.

1:33:46.323 --> 1:33:47.960
Well, that's good to hear.

1:33:52.131 --> 1:33:55.330
Should we, uh...
should we get going?

1:33:55.365 --> 1:33:57.431
Sure. Where?

1:34:04.913 --> 1:34:06.308
You're right about me,
you know.

1:34:08.983 --> 1:34:10.081
What?

1:34:11.348 --> 1:34:13.216
I know nothing about this.

1:34:15.990 --> 1:34:17.891
Grew up with a silver spoon.

1:34:18.993 --> 1:34:21.488
Completely disconnected.

1:34:21.523 --> 1:34:23.457
And the strongest memory
I have of my mom

1:34:23.492 --> 1:34:27.395
was her picture
hanging above my crib.

1:34:27.430 --> 1:34:31.036
And I joined the bureau so I
could mean something to someone.

1:34:32.941 --> 1:34:34.941
Can't say that's working out.

1:34:38.276 --> 1:34:39.715
Why'd you join?

1:34:41.851 --> 1:34:43.510
Doesn't matter why I joined.

1:34:43.545 --> 1:34:46.018
Only matters what I do with it.

1:34:52.928 --> 1:34:53.960
Yeah.

1:34:55.095 --> 1:34:56.490
What?

1:34:56.525 --> 1:34:59.735
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1:35:01.398 --> 1:35:04.465
Hospital has Sally on file.
Over 30 years ago.

1:35:04.500 --> 1:35:08.876
Numerous ER visits,
various, um... accidents.

1:35:08.911 --> 1:35:10.779
She was brought in
by her brother.

1:35:10.814 --> 1:35:12.242
There's a home address.

1:35:16.952 --> 1:35:22.219
Uh... I don't wanna
give her back.

1:35:22.254 --> 1:35:24.056
I wanna buy her out.

1:35:26.225 --> 1:35:27.389
The girl?

1:35:27.424 --> 1:35:28.995
Leila, yeah.

1:35:31.934 --> 1:35:34.330
Well, what are you
gonna do with her?

1:35:35.597 --> 1:35:37.036
Where are you
gonna get the money?

1:35:37.071 --> 1:35:38.565
I have some money.

1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:39.940
How much?

1:35:42.010 --> 1:35:43.504
How'd you get it?

1:35:43.539 --> 1:35:47.112
Enough. I should have some
left over, too.

1:35:47.147 --> 1:35:49.312
- Mm-hmm.
- How did you get it?

1:35:52.317 --> 1:35:54.185
How'd you get the money, Sal?

1:35:55.122 --> 1:35:56.792
Sold my trailer.

1:36:11.941 --> 1:36:13.336
She needs us.

1:36:14.911 --> 1:36:16.812
The way we needed each other.

1:36:19.278 --> 1:36:22.246
You mean like a--
like a family or something?

1:36:28.485 --> 1:36:29.990
Well...

1:36:30.025 --> 1:36:31.354
Well, that would take me

1:36:31.389 --> 1:36:34.192
just a little bit of time
to get used to.

1:36:34.227 --> 1:36:35.391
You know?

1:36:38.033 --> 1:36:39.131
Yeah.

1:36:50.342 --> 1:36:52.210
All right.

1:36:52.245 --> 1:36:55.279
We do this, you gotta let me
take care of it, all right?

1:36:55.314 --> 1:36:56.643
I'm gonna bring 'em the cash.

1:36:56.678 --> 1:36:59.217
Pay. Done.

1:37:00.616 --> 1:37:03.386
All right. Okay.

1:37:07.458 --> 1:37:09.062
Where's the bathroom?

1:37:09.097 --> 1:37:11.460
We're-we're gonna
take a little ride. Uh...

1:37:11.495 --> 1:37:15.464
No. No.
Leila stays with me.

1:37:15.499 --> 1:37:18.401
No, that's not
how it works, sis.
I gotta bring her.

1:37:18.436 --> 1:37:21.173
You-you could've taken her
to the police
for all they know.

1:37:21.208 --> 1:37:23.373
All right. I'll go then.

1:37:23.408 --> 1:37:25.342
No, Sal. Sal.

1:37:25.377 --> 1:37:27.575
If she's going, I'm going.
Uh, Leila, let's go.

1:37:27.610 --> 1:37:29.544
- Sal.
- I still have to pee.

1:37:29.579 --> 1:37:31.282
It's-it's just right here.

1:37:31.317 --> 1:37:34.120
- Useless...
- I'll turn the truck around.

1:37:34.155 --> 1:37:35.253
It's just a bad idea.

1:37:35.288 --> 1:37:36.419
Get out of your pajamas.

1:37:36.454 --> 1:37:37.585
It's time to go.

1:37:48.499 --> 1:37:51.137
<i>Joining conference now.</i>

1:37:51.172 --> 1:37:52.369
Sally's here.

1:37:52.404 --> 1:37:54.305
Hi, Sally.

1:37:54.340 --> 1:37:56.109
<i>Dolly's here with us.</i>

1:37:56.144 --> 1:37:58.573
That's right, Rose.
Pattie's here, too.

1:37:58.608 --> 1:38:01.609
<i>She's slow as a little turtle,</i>
<i>just like you, Sally.</i>

1:38:01.644 --> 1:38:04.480
Come on, baby doll, get with it.

1:38:04.515 --> 1:38:06.680
- <i> I'm just sayin'.</i>
- <i> Shut up, Dolly.</i>

1:38:06.715 --> 1:38:10.156
<i>Sally's got some serious</i>
<i>business to take care of.</i>

1:38:10.191 --> 1:38:11.553
<i>Where are you headed?</i>

1:38:11.588 --> 1:38:15.161
Remember that old airport?
Southeast?

1:38:15.196 --> 1:38:17.361
Hell yeah,
I remember that place.

1:38:17.396 --> 1:38:21.134
Yeah, me too, I was gonna be
a flight attendant
before I broke my teeth.

1:38:24.238 --> 1:38:30.077
Just wanna tell ya,
it's good to know you ladies
are out there.

1:38:30.112 --> 1:38:32.244
We're always out here.

1:38:32.279 --> 1:38:33.674
<i>Come rain or come shine.</i>

1:38:42.355 --> 1:38:45.389
Dennis? Leila?

1:38:47.261 --> 1:38:48.491
Let's go!

1:38:50.297 --> 1:38:51.461
You look fucked up.

1:38:51.496 --> 1:38:53.463
Huh? Oh, yeah?

1:38:53.498 --> 1:38:56.367
Oh, yeah.
Freezing out there.

1:38:56.402 --> 1:38:59.238
Well, Leila found something.
I think you're gonna like it.

1:39:03.310 --> 1:39:06.014
Sal, what are you doin'?

1:39:09.316 --> 1:39:10.744
What are you doin'?

1:39:10.779 --> 1:39:13.153
It's-it's-it's-it's the dress

1:39:13.188 --> 1:39:15.518
that dad bought you
for your 13th birthday.

1:39:15.553 --> 1:39:17.355
I thought you'd like it.

1:39:17.390 --> 1:39:20.259
- I thought you'd like it, Sal.
- Take it off.
Take it off, Leila.

1:39:20.294 --> 1:39:21.656
Sal-- I-I thought
you'd think it was cute.

1:39:21.691 --> 1:39:22.657
I thought you'd like it.
I--

1:39:22.692 --> 1:39:24.527
- I don't!
- All right, all right,

1:39:24.562 --> 1:39:27.629
- I fucked up. I'm sorry!
- Take it off!

1:40:16.482 --> 1:40:17.547
It's clear.

1:40:37.899 --> 1:40:39.107
Hair.

1:40:40.836 --> 1:40:42.308
They were here.

1:40:44.510 --> 1:40:45.509
We missed 'em.

1:40:48.316 --> 1:40:52.186
Shit, shit, shit, shit.
Shit!

1:41:17.774 --> 1:41:18.839
I'll go.

1:41:34.263 --> 1:41:35.493
Where's the girl?

1:41:35.528 --> 1:41:37.165
I wanna buy her out.

1:41:38.894 --> 1:41:40.432
That wasn't the deal.

1:41:40.467 --> 1:41:42.368
I'll pay more
than the going rate.

1:41:43.734 --> 1:41:44.700
Let me see her.

1:41:44.735 --> 1:41:45.767
No.

1:41:49.377 --> 1:41:51.410
- Come on.
- Dennis!

1:41:53.843 --> 1:41:55.414
I have the cash.

1:41:57.748 --> 1:41:59.517
But I need to know
we're cut clean.

1:42:00.586 --> 1:42:03.257
My brother, me, the girl.

1:42:03.292 --> 1:42:04.885
And we don't see you anymore.

1:42:08.429 --> 1:42:11.925
Sure. You bought it, you own it.

1:42:23.004 --> 1:42:26.478
Really? You think I'm just
gonna let you take the girl?

1:42:26.513 --> 1:42:28.645
How do I know you won't talk?

1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:31.318
'Cause I'm just as guilty
as everybody else.

1:42:33.685 --> 1:42:35.619
- That's it, just get the girl
and let's get out of here!

1:42:35.654 --> 1:42:37.984
Don't hurt my sister!
I said, don't hurt my sister!

1:42:38.019 --> 1:42:39.722
- Back here!
- Hey.

1:42:39.757 --> 1:42:40.954
Get the girl
and let's go!

1:42:40.989 --> 1:42:42.494
- Hey!

1:42:44.025 --> 1:42:44.924
- Hey!
- Fuck!

1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:47.334
- Hey! Easy.

1:42:47.369 --> 1:42:49.369
- Den--
- Hey! Get off her!

1:42:49.404 --> 1:42:50.568
- Get off her! Hey!
- Fuck you!

1:42:50.603 --> 1:42:52.306
- Hey, go easy!
- Get him!

1:42:55.443 --> 1:42:57.509
Dennis, what?

1:43:00.415 --> 1:43:03.911
I said-- I told him
not to hurt my sister.

1:43:03.946 --> 1:43:06.012
You said to make it look real!

1:43:06.047 --> 1:43:09.323
Not that real!
I said don't hurt my sister!

1:43:09.358 --> 1:43:12.623
You didn't have to kill him!

1:43:12.658 --> 1:43:15.395
Why couldn't you just get
the fucking kid, Claire? Huh?

1:43:17.465 --> 1:43:19.432
I told you exactly where
she was!

1:43:19.467 --> 1:43:21.401
- Now get in the van!
- Let go!

1:43:21.436 --> 1:43:22.534
- Dennis?
- Let go of me!

1:43:22.569 --> 1:43:23.568
You-you weren't
supposed to see this.

1:43:23.604 --> 1:43:25.999
- No, Sal. Sal, listen, Sal--
- Let go of me!

1:43:26.034 --> 1:43:27.572
- Dennis--
- Let go of me!

1:43:27.607 --> 1:43:30.443
Stop it! Sal, you weren't
supposed to see this.

1:43:30.478 --> 1:43:32.379
Sal. Sal, no! Let her go!

1:43:32.414 --> 1:43:33.842
Let her go! Let her go.

1:43:35.012 --> 1:43:37.912
I was just gonna do it for a bit
till we got on our feet.

1:43:37.947 --> 1:43:40.486
Sal, you were not
supposed to see this.

1:43:40.521 --> 1:43:43.588
Get in the fucking van, Claire!

1:43:46.923 --> 1:43:48.461
Sal...

1:43:48.496 --> 1:43:49.594
Please...

1:43:49.629 --> 1:43:51.629
Claire, get in the van.

1:43:54.634 --> 1:43:56.436
- Please.
- Let me get rid of her, okay?

1:43:56.471 --> 1:43:57.866
Just let me get rid of her,

1:43:57.901 --> 1:44:01.309
and-and we get back to us,
Sal, I promise.

1:44:01.344 --> 1:44:03.311
You'll see, it's gonna be fine.

1:44:03.346 --> 1:44:04.972
No, Sally!

1:44:05.007 --> 1:44:06.545
Sal, it's gonna be okay.

1:44:06.580 --> 1:44:08.547
Sally! Please!

1:44:11.453 --> 1:44:13.915
No!

1:44:16.821 --> 1:44:20.493
Dennis, stop! Stop! Don't!

1:44:23.828 --> 1:44:25.025
Leila!

1:44:31.572 --> 1:44:32.835
Leila!

1:45:00.161 --> 1:45:02.370
Leila. Leila.

1:45:07.003 --> 1:45:08.937
Sally?

1:45:08.972 --> 1:45:10.510
Come on, Sal!

1:45:13.141 --> 1:45:14.514
Come on, Sal!

1:45:14.549 --> 1:45:16.076
Fly away with me.

1:45:18.047 --> 1:45:20.454
Come fly away with me.

1:45:20.489 --> 1:45:21.983
We'll go to Mars...

1:45:22.018 --> 1:45:26.119
Saturn, and we'll go
to Jupiter and China.

1:45:26.154 --> 1:45:28.891
Anywhere but here.
We get the hell outta here.

1:45:33.469 --> 1:45:35.898
We're just a couple of kids.

1:45:35.933 --> 1:45:38.131
- Kids... Sal?

1:45:38.166 --> 1:45:39.440
No, Dennis.

1:45:40.135 --> 1:45:41.508
They are kids.

1:45:42.709 --> 1:45:44.544
Not us.

1:45:45.910 --> 1:45:47.910
How much you sell 'em for?

1:45:47.945 --> 1:45:50.451
- No.
- How much a job?

1:45:50.486 --> 1:45:52.145
- No.
- How many times a day?

1:45:52.180 --> 1:45:54.114
No, you-you
got it all wrong.

1:45:54.149 --> 1:45:55.918
Sal, I do it for you.
I do it for you!

1:45:55.953 --> 1:45:58.085
- No!
- I-- Everything I do...

1:46:04.566 --> 1:46:05.994
I want you to tell me...

1:46:07.569 --> 1:46:10.636
what-what that girl
does for you that I don't do.

1:46:13.069 --> 1:46:14.772
What do you owe her?

1:46:14.807 --> 1:46:16.675
She doesn't owe me anything.

1:46:39.667 --> 1:46:40.765
Sal...

1:46:42.571 --> 1:46:43.900
Hey, Sal.

1:47:14.933 --> 1:47:16.537
Let's get you in the car.

1:47:16.572 --> 1:47:17.736
Watch your head, all right?

1:47:22.039 --> 1:47:23.038
Hey.

1:47:30.916 --> 1:47:32.146
Worried about him?

1:47:36.218 --> 1:47:37.855
Never gonna stop.

1:47:40.321 --> 1:47:42.563
Well, if we can
get him to help us...

1:47:44.061 --> 1:47:46.061
maybe we can catch the big guy.

1:47:48.934 --> 1:47:51.737
Promise you'll take care
of those kids.

1:47:51.772 --> 1:47:55.741
Oh, don't worry.
I'll see to them.

1:47:55.776 --> 1:47:57.710
That's what gets me
up in the morning.

1:48:03.850 --> 1:48:08.952
Well, you...
probably better get going.

1:48:08.987 --> 1:48:10.789
Local police are on their way.

1:48:12.793 --> 1:48:14.694
We have your statement, so...

1:48:20.702 --> 1:48:22.064
Have a nice ride.

1:48:40.282 --> 1:48:42.150
You know, we're gonna
get in trouble for this.

1:48:43.252 --> 1:48:45.186
I'm gonna get
in trouble for this.

1:48:45.221 --> 1:48:46.726
You didn't know
shit about it.

1:48:48.059 --> 1:48:50.565
It's not your fault
if I went rogue.
