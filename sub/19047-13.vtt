00:19.720 --> 00:21.153
Huh?
You wrote a musical?

00:21.155 --> 00:22.488

Who's playing this Lead Boy?

That's gonna be Mac.
What?

02:19.340 --> 02:21.874

Lead, of course.
Who's playing the Dayman?

02:21.876 --> 02:25.511
The Lead Boy becomes
the Dayman when he defeats
the Nightman. So it's also Mac.

02:25.513 --> 02:28.413
Two parts?
Oh, yeah!
Wait. That's bullshit. Bro--

02:28.415 --> 02:31.617
- The Nightman's a better role.
- He gets to play two roles?
Come on.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.286
- It's the same person.
- Charlie, who's playing
the troll guy?

02:34.288 --> 02:36.688
- You're gonna play
the troll guy.
- I'm the troll guy?

02:36.690 --> 02:39.224
- Who else would be the troll?
- Oh! I like that.

02:39.226 --> 02:40.826

Can I do it naked?

02:40.828 --> 02:43.162
Absolutely not.
Why would you want to be naked?

02:43.164 --> 02:46.198
Because in the '70s,
everybody did theater naked.

all the time.

and remember something.

Uh, let's see. Was it--
Did Dee write a musical
and come to Charlie with it?

05:25.125 --> 05:29.428
No! Charlie wrote a musical
and came to Dee with it--
and the gang.

05:29.430 --> 05:34.566
And the gang likes to screw it
up and make it about themselves
and take it away from Charlie...

a scenario for you.

I could cut the song, okay?
Because I wrote it.

05:41.842 --> 05:45.577
I could have Artemis
do the song, okay?
Because you did not write it.

and I could do the song myself.

cross the stage?
Yes.

07:58.479 --> 08:02.180

opportunity to showcase some
skills and just put on a clinic.

I think the people
are gonna want to see that.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.919

Oh, Jesus Christ.

Okay. Once he gets near you,
you have to sense him, okay?

08:13.160 --> 08:16.094
- Suddenly you sense him.
- What if I were to
position him...

08:16.096 --> 08:17.229
in a way
where I get behind him,

08:17.231 --> 08:19.898
then Frank could throw
that blanket he's got
right there over us.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.566
Oh, yeah.
Then that way you can't
see the penetration.

08:21.568 --> 08:24.870
That's a good idea. You know
what, Charlie? Because the
blanket will make the raping--

08:24.872 --> 08:27.973
I'm sorry, the, uh,
"sexing" from behind--
feel more classy.

08:27.975 --> 08:32.644
That's good. Then what
I can do is thrust this way.
And you can struggle.

08:33.980 --> 08:35.247
Now I'm here. Okay?
I am--

08:35.249 --> 08:40.218
I'm past where I thought
I could go. I'm like
all the way up here with it.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.658
Oh, my God. Hey, you.
Oh, my God!
You scared me.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.793
I'm sorry. I dropped,
like, a hundred dollar bill
under there,

08:48.795 --> 08:51.663

and then-- What are you
doing walking here?

08:51.665 --> 08:54.566

And I also held up
my end of the bargain, so
I never have to see you again.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.408
Okay. So wait. Just--

19:37.410 --> 19:41.279
I'm sorry.
I want to get this clear.
Uh, you are saying no?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.948
Oh, I am definitely,
definitely saying no.

19:43.950 --> 19:47.251
Okay. Well, I didn't
ever sign anything.

19:47.253 --> 19:51.389
So, um,
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.761
That's it.
You can go home.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.530
It's over.
[ Dennis ]
Well, we're gonna do a bow.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.566
Hold on.
Yeah?

20:01.568 --> 20:02.767
Uh, if you want.

20:02.769 --> 20:06.671
It was a great
musical, Charlie.
You did a great job.

20:06.673 --> 20:09.273
She ain't worth it.

20:12.844 --> 20:16.480
Told you nobody just writes
a musical for no reason.

20:16.482 --> 20:19.650
I am here. I am--
I am past here.

20:20.485 --> 20:21.953
And by the way,

20:21.955 --> 20:23.621
I thought the rape scene
went really well.

20:23.623 --> 20:27.458
I-- I am here.
I am here with it.
And that was awful for me.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.894
And if you bring this up
back at the apartment tonight,

20:29.896 --> 20:32.830
I am going to smack you.
I swear to God.

21:05.397 --> 21:08.866
