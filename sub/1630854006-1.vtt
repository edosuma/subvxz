gone in with her.

00:17.451 --> 00:19.018
Oh, come on.

00:19.053 --> 00:21.453
It's only been 17 minutes.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.821
It only takes 1 minute to say

00:22.857 --> 00:24.356
I know you've been cheating.

00:24.425 --> 00:28.127
She should have just
slashed his tires.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.462
Okay, this is not
sophomore year of college.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.265
(chuckles)

00:33.334 --> 00:36.635
adam was so mad!(laughs)

00:36.670 --> 00:38.203
okay, but not as mad
as his dad.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.272
It was his car, remember?

00:40.307 --> 00:43.042
(allison laughs harder)

00:43.077 --> 00:44.910
I am glad that we have
matured.

00:44.945 --> 00:47.579
(both laughing)

00:47.648 --> 00:49.681
and that reesa decided
to handle this whole thing--

00:49.717 --> 00:50.349
reesa: Go! Go!
Melina: Whoa!

00:50.384 --> 00:52.684
Start the car!

00:52.753 --> 00:55.821
Oh, hey! Reesa?
What's up with the dog?

00:55.890 --> 00:57.289
It is my dog!

01:00.194 --> 01:01.560
He'll have to sue me for
custody.

01:01.595 --> 01:02.661
-That a girl!
-Yes!

01:02.696 --> 01:04.063
Oh. Okay.

01:04.131 --> 01:06.365
Reesa! Come back!

01:11.772 --> 01:15.040
Thank you for being there
for me today.

01:15.076 --> 01:16.175
I know I did the right thing,

01:16.210 --> 01:19.311
but it still hurts.

01:19.346 --> 01:21.680
I'm just glad you came
to your senses.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.315
And you know what?

01:23.384 --> 01:25.250
Look at it this way.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.619
Now you can go
find your soulmate.

01:27.688 --> 01:30.255
-Whee!
-Yeah!

01:30.324 --> 01:32.658
I mean, he might be in paris.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.327
Yeah. You should
come with me this summer.

01:35.362 --> 01:38.564
I can't.
I'm kind of a mom now.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.733
Besides, I need to stay here
and find a full-time job.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.501
I can't believe the gang's
breaking up.

01:42.536 --> 01:45.137
I know.

01:45.172 --> 01:47.806
Allison, maybe you should
reconsider

01:47.842 --> 01:50.175
moving all the way
to north carolina with lionel.

01:50.244 --> 01:52.911
Reesa: Uh-oh.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.379
I told you I will come
and visit once a month.

01:54.415 --> 01:55.547
-I promise.
-(melina sighs)

01:55.583 --> 01:58.717
that's not fair.

01:58.752 --> 02:01.487
You guys are the only two
spelmanites

02:01.522 --> 02:03.288
that I hang out with.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.090
-Ladies!
-Melina: What?

02:05.126 --> 02:07.759
Our lives are just beginning!

02:07.795 --> 02:09.394
Okay we may not do the things
we used to do but...

02:11.599 --> 02:13.532
Oh.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.667
This is a celebration.

02:15.703 --> 02:18.804
Um...

02:18.839 --> 02:20.439
Here's to falling in love
with your fresh start.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.607

02:21.642 --> 02:23.442
Always.

Remember our song?

02:25.746 --> 02:26.912

03:05.019 --> 03:08.620
The hue of prosperity.

03:08.656 --> 03:11.623
The seed of creativity
is planted,

03:11.659 --> 03:14.159
and I am blossoming into
a better me.

03:14.228 --> 03:18.530
And from my lens,
to my landscape,

03:18.566 --> 03:21.533
I'm inspired,
and the source of my power

03:21.569 --> 03:25.437
is green.

03:25.472 --> 03:28.240
Wow. I'm amazed at how
you just come up

03:28.275 --> 03:30.375
with such beautiful words.

03:30.411 --> 03:33.212
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

03:33.247 --> 03:36.081
At one time, it was my um,

03:36.150 --> 03:38.984
it was my dream
to be an author.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.186
I'm always learning
something new about you.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.254
(allison chuckles)

03:42.289 --> 03:44.323
what happened?

03:44.358 --> 03:47.059
I focused solely
on my teaching career

03:47.094 --> 03:49.361
and then there wasn't any time.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.029
It's never too late.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.799
You sound like my friend melina.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.500
I can't wait for you
to meet my friends.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.102
Me too.

03:57.137 --> 03:59.137
This girls' trip is long
overdue.

03:59.206 --> 04:03.375
And I hope you have time
to meet my mom.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.544
She'll be here next week
for the truffle hunt.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.945
Surprise.

04:06.981 --> 04:08.180
I'm honored.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.148
But?

04:10.217 --> 04:13.051
But do you think
we should be doing that

04:13.087 --> 04:14.253
since I'm leaving
in a couple of months?

04:14.288 --> 04:17.022
You're right, but she asked

04:17.057 --> 04:17.823
to meet the woman
behind my smile,

04:17.858 --> 04:18.056
and you're the woman.

04:20.294 --> 04:22.961
Alli, this year

04:22.997 --> 04:25.931
has been incredible
for all of us.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.400
If I don't go back
to my students at a&t,

04:28.435 --> 04:31.336
I might not have any.

04:31.372 --> 04:34.172
Okay, got it, so I say,

04:34.208 --> 04:36.942
we soak up the sun,
enjoy the summer.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.378
Hmm...

04:39.413 --> 04:40.279
And I've got
two more months

04:40.314 --> 04:41.747
to work my charm.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.348
Come on. Let's go.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.366
You haven't said anything
since we left the doctors.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.639
There's nothing to say.
We keep trying.

05:07.708 --> 05:08.707
If it's meant for us
to have a family,

05:08.742 --> 05:09.941
it will happen.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.176
As long as you're okay.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.280
The weather is nice.

05:15.316 --> 05:17.316
We'll get a lot of planting
done.

05:17.351 --> 05:20.319
Oh. Here's my list.

05:20.387 --> 05:22.254
Oh.

05:22.289 --> 05:24.222
-Good morning.
-Oh, good morning.

05:24.258 --> 05:26.058
You're the first ones here.

05:26.093 --> 05:27.959
Oh. Well, you know
what they say.

05:27.995 --> 05:28.960
The early bird
gets the azaleas.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.595
(reesa laughs)

05:30.631 --> 05:33.799
so, what are we looking for?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.801
Well, kale, collards, onions,
cucumbers,

05:35.869 --> 05:37.602
tomatoes, squash.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.037
Maybe strawberries?

05:39.073 --> 05:40.305
Definitely strawberries.

05:40.341 --> 05:41.840
A big gardener, I see.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.276
A new one.
I'm recently retired.

05:44.311 --> 05:45.777
We're trying our hand
at farm-to-table dinners.

05:45.813 --> 05:48.113
Let's start in aisle 8.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.249
I think this list is ambitious.

05:51.285 --> 05:52.851
Don't be scared.

05:52.886 --> 05:56.621
(watch phone rings)

05:56.657 --> 05:58.623
hey girlie. I'm just out getting
gardening supplies. What's up?

05:58.659 --> 06:00.992
Melina: I can't go to Italy.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.528
I'm on my way.
We gotta go.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.364
What? But I thought we were...

06:08.469 --> 06:09.534
Sorry.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.014
Okay. This is my third batch.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.316
This one has to be good.

06:24.351 --> 06:27.452
Okay. Oh! I--

06:27.488 --> 06:28.887
oh! Great!

06:28.922 --> 06:30.722
The smell. It's--

06:30.758 --> 06:32.424
see? My mojo is off!
I told you.

06:32.459 --> 06:36.528
Everything is wrong, alright?

06:36.563 --> 06:39.030
Oh, my gosh, and I have had
this headache for weeks.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.466
Okay. First just calm down.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.136
And let's just talk it all
through.

06:44.171 --> 06:44.870
I still can't believe that tapas
is in the red.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.572
I know.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.641
I told you, I cannot take out
another loan.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.043
If I do not boost my sales by
the end of summer, I just...

06:52.112 --> 06:54.379
Don't even go down
that rabbit hole.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.314
That's why I'm here
to help you figure it out.

06:56.350 --> 06:59.418
I just don't know why you didn't
say anything before today.

06:59.453 --> 07:02.387
Come on, you know I've always
told you everything,

07:02.423 --> 07:03.655
but I was such a burden
during chemo.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.957
No, no, no. Stop that.

07:05.993 --> 07:06.458
You know I wanted
to be there for you.

07:08.262 --> 07:10.295
But still.

07:10.330 --> 07:12.631
I thought business
would've picked up by now,

07:12.699 --> 07:15.867
and thank you so much

07:15.903 --> 07:17.636
for staying with me until
closing.

07:17.671 --> 07:17.969
Of course.
That's what friends are for.

07:18.005 --> 07:21.273
Yes.

07:21.308 --> 07:25.010
Listen to me,
I know you're a fighter.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.978
I watched you kick
cancer's butt,

07:27.047 --> 07:29.514
and I know
you're gonna beat this.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.983
Is this really all you need?

07:32.019 --> 07:34.786
Yes, I told you.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.022
Every restaurant that has been
featured in this magazine

07:37.090 --> 07:42.060
has doubled their clientele,
okay? (sighs)

07:42.095 --> 07:44.095
and with their food critic
coming
unannounced this month,

07:44.164 --> 07:45.964
you see why I can't leave.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.066
No, I don't.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.935
Let one of the managers
handle it.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.638
It's my restaurant.
It's my responsibility.

07:53.707 --> 07:57.676
We have not seen
our girl allison in three years,

07:57.711 --> 08:01.313
and what about that cooking
class
you wanted to take in Italy?

08:01.348 --> 08:04.583
I know. Why do you think
I'm so upset, reesa?

08:04.618 --> 08:06.017
You gotta start
putting yourself first.

08:06.086 --> 08:08.320
You need to call this magazine,

08:08.388 --> 08:09.788
tell them you're gonna be gone
for two weeks.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.756
Ask them if they can push it
back.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.658
And then, you and I
are gonna go to Italy,

08:13.694 --> 08:16.461
and visit our girl.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.196
You're gonna take that
italian cooking class

08:18.265 --> 08:21.967
and come back with new
italian recipes

08:22.035 --> 08:22.133
that are going to
blow his socks off.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.071
That's the-that's what
I'm looking for.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.572
That's not a bad idea.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.407
Hashtag breakthrough.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.842
Breakthrough!
Breakthrough!

08:30.878 --> 08:31.977
We nailed it!
And I love you.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.512
Oh my gosh, I love you, too.

Italy looks good
on you, girl.

09:40.948 --> 09:44.082
I mean your hair, your clothes.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.551
Allison: Have some wine.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.687
Have some cheese.
Relax!

09:48.722 --> 09:49.120
(melina sighs)

09:51.525 --> 09:53.825
let me have these.

09:53.860 --> 09:56.194
Last time I held your hand
was 3 years ago.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.997
Hmm. Yeah.

09:59.066 --> 10:01.967
And I was just coming
out of surgery,

10:02.002 --> 10:07.305
and you leaned over
and you whispered in my ear.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.641
Now do you remember
what you told me?

10:09.676 --> 10:11.176
I do. I said hurry up
and get well

10:11.244 --> 10:12.911
so I can buy you a sexy dress,

10:12.946 --> 10:15.380
and you can show off

10:15.415 --> 10:16.181
both: Your new girls.
(laughing)

10:18.685 --> 10:21.152
-listen.
-Yeah?

10:21.188 --> 10:23.822
I know I've said it
time and time again

10:23.857 --> 10:25.624
but I really appreciate you
calling me every day

10:25.659 --> 10:27.759
to check on me.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.361
But how are you?
You still good?

10:29.396 --> 10:32.864
-I'm good.
-Okay.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.299
As long as I keep
the stress away, you know?

10:34.334 --> 10:37.969
And getting
my regular checkups.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.872
The doctor says
I will be just fine.

10:40.907 --> 10:44.376
It is so good
to lay eyes on you.

10:44.411 --> 10:47.712
You look amazing.
And your hair!

10:47.748 --> 10:48.313
I know. I...

10:51.685 --> 10:53.018
I'm so lucky.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.086
You are.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.888
I missed you.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.223
I love you so much, honey.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.192
♪ I've played the game

11:01.228 --> 11:04.029
♪ I've rolled the dice

11:04.097 --> 11:05.430
♪ I may have even won
once or twice ♪

11:05.465 --> 11:08.133
(allison sighs)

11:08.168 --> 11:10.068
your posts don't do this view
any justice.

11:10.103 --> 11:11.903
Can you believe this is
a university rental?

11:11.938 --> 11:14.406
Do you honestly have to leave?

11:14.474 --> 11:16.041
I mean, that's
the million-dollar question,

11:16.076 --> 11:17.842
and yeah, I do.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.249
Did you marinade these olives
in lemon juice

11:24.284 --> 11:26.284
because they are
absolutely delicious.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.053
Yes, I did. That's a trick
that nico taught me.

11:28.088 --> 11:31.790
Both: Oh, nico!
(laughing)

11:31.825 --> 11:32.957
oh, I can't wait to meet him!

11:32.993 --> 11:35.560
Same.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.828
You got this incredible food,
this breathtaking view,

11:36.897 --> 11:39.297
gorgeous house, and nico.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.766
Sounds like someone

11:41.835 --> 11:43.034
is walking away
from a perfect life.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.670
Oh, no, no, no.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.272
I've had a perfect life
and one messy divorce.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.674
And years of therapy later.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.810
And I am not going back
down that road.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.878
Yeah. But that was
north carolina, allison.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.581
This is Italy!

11:56.650 --> 11:58.183
-Italy!!
(allison laughs)

11:58.218 --> 12:00.251
come on. It's no comparison.

12:00.287 --> 12:01.953
I've been at a&t for 12 years.

12:01.988 --> 12:04.055
Dr. Barnes would have a
conniption.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.957
Plus, you know,
I don't have a job here.

12:06.026 --> 12:09.027
So, get one,
and then send him a text

12:09.062 --> 12:10.361
with this view and hashtag

12:10.397 --> 12:12.063
sorry, not sorry.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.032
(allison laughs)

12:14.101 --> 12:15.834
higher e ducation.

12:15.902 --> 12:19.304
I mean, it's very competitive,
and uh,

12:19.372 --> 12:21.673
but who's starting over
at our age?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.842
Um...

12:23.877 --> 12:26.311
I just retired. So, me?

12:26.346 --> 12:29.314
Me too.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.483
I mean, my restaurant
has only been open a year.

12:31.551 --> 12:34.519
Okay, well...Good for you.

12:34.554 --> 12:36.187
But that's not me.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.989
I mean, it's a nice thought,

12:38.024 --> 12:40.859
but it doesn't make sense.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.627
You know what would
make sense right now?

12:42.662 --> 12:43.895
-More food.
-Yes.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.431
We should go to that cafe.

12:46.466 --> 12:46.598
The one you're always
talking about.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.038
Melina: I love this cafe.
It's super cute.

12:54.074 --> 12:56.508
Yeah.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.809
I'm actually really feeling
your whole new vibe.

12:57.844 --> 13:01.613
You're like the old allison

13:01.648 --> 13:03.081
because you are writing again!

13:03.116 --> 13:04.883
Oh, yeah, I mean,

13:04.918 --> 13:06.651
I wasn't writing for years,

13:06.686 --> 13:09.220
but since I came here,

13:09.289 --> 13:11.990
it's just been, you know,
flowing up.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.958
Italy's good for you.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.026
It's stirring up your passion.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.761
Oh. That part.

13:16.797 --> 13:18.196
Oh...

13:18.231 --> 13:20.899
Oh, you know what?

13:20.967 --> 13:24.102
Could you write some creative
blurbs
for my menu?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.470
Of course.
You know I've got you.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.105
Um, how is the restaurant?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.107
It's great!

13:29.142 --> 13:32.410
Yeah. Reesa,
she comes all the time.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.045
She'll tell you. It's great.
Right, reesa?

13:34.080 --> 13:34.813
Sure, yeah. It's one of
my favorite places.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.681
Allison: Oh.

13:36.716 --> 13:38.082
And how's retirement?

13:38.118 --> 13:40.418
Oh. You know.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.720
Knocking items off the bucket
list.

13:42.756 --> 13:45.023
And spending more time with
andre.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.326
Oh. You don't sound
too happy about that.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.562
We just haven't been
clicking lately.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.997
We needed some time apart.

13:53.033 --> 13:53.565
But I'm going to enjoy
these two weeks.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.201
So, all good.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.037
Okay. Well, I'm here
if you want to talk.

13:59.072 --> 14:01.005
-(cell phone beeps)
-oh, that's alright.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.608
Oh! Dr. Di grado just texted me

14:03.643 --> 14:05.877
to come by his office. Um...

14:05.946 --> 14:07.979
Do you guys want to go by
the campus

14:08.014 --> 14:10.748
before we go shopping?

14:10.784 --> 14:12.350
Allison: I'm so impressed
with your italian, reesa.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.652
You know, I've been trying.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.688
I figure, when in rome...
(chuckles)

14:16.723 --> 14:18.957
what? You know like
3 words, okay?

14:18.992 --> 14:19.824
That's 3 words more
than you know.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.292
That's true.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.228
And this place? Oh my god.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.296
Everywhere we go,

14:25.365 --> 14:27.265
it feels like we're in
a postcard.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.901
Right? Oh, I can see why
everyone
falls in love here.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.637
I mean, it's so romantic.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.472
That's the library.
Books floor to ceiling.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.208
Oh, the chapel, it's gorgeous.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.943
I taught creative writing
in this building.

14:38.979 --> 14:40.411
Four classes every day.

14:40.447 --> 14:43.181
Whoa. Isn't that a lot?

14:43.216 --> 14:45.316
You know,
it didn't seem like it.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.318
Back home I taught two english
lit classes every day,

14:47.354 --> 14:48.686
and analyzing structure
and grading papers

14:48.755 --> 14:50.722
is far more time consuming.

14:50.757 --> 14:52.690
Dr. Cooper, just who
I've been looking for.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.425
-Buona sera.
-Buona sera.

14:54.461 --> 14:54.926
I was just coming to see you.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.662
Oh.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.197
These are my friends visiting
from the united states.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.699
Reesa and melina.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.468
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.069
I won't take much of your time.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.471
Can we talk?

15:06.539 --> 15:08.373
Oh, sure.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.674
-We'll be over here.
-Okay.

15:09.709 --> 15:10.074
(chuckles)

15:14.314 --> 15:16.915
my colleagues and I
were so impressed with you

15:16.950 --> 15:19.284
that we'd like to offer you
an opportunity

15:19.319 --> 15:22.921
to teach your
creative writing class full
time.

15:22.956 --> 15:26.658
We are requesting you commit
for one year,

15:26.693 --> 15:28.660
although we'd love
to have you longer.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.028
The official offer will be
emailed.

15:33.266 --> 15:37.035
Grazie. What an honor.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.637
I understand that this is
a career adjustment,

15:39.673 --> 15:41.105
but know
there is lots of room for
growth.

15:44.644 --> 15:45.643
That's good to know.
(both chuckle)

15:45.679 --> 15:46.611
um...

15:50.050 --> 15:51.883
Do I have time
to think about it?

15:51.918 --> 15:54.218
Sure. But the board meets
at the end of the day

15:54.287 --> 15:56.120
on next Friday.

15:56.156 --> 15:58.289
If we don't have an answer
by then,

15:58.325 --> 16:00.258
we will move on
to another candidate.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.794
No, no.
You will have an answer.

16:02.862 --> 16:04.395
-Okay. (chuckles)
-okay.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.898
-Thank you.
-Grazie.

16:06.967 --> 16:07.498
-Buona sera.
-Buona sera.

16:14.708 --> 16:17.208
So, what are you going to do
about the offer?

16:17.243 --> 16:18.743
Well, I have to talk
with the chancellor

16:18.778 --> 16:21.646
before I can even consider it.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.948
Hey. It's an amazing
opportunity.

16:23.984 --> 16:25.316
Yeah, well, I don't want
to spend all day

16:25.352 --> 16:27.485
talking about it.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.320
I want to take you guys
to my favorite boutique.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.789
You know, I was wondering

16:31.858 --> 16:34.692
if we could just go look
for cookbooks instead.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.394
Are you serious right now?
Cookbooks
instead of couture?

16:36.463 --> 16:38.997
What is going on with you?

16:39.032 --> 16:42.400
Mm, you should see
the old macdonald overalls.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.369
You used to have the best style!

16:44.404 --> 16:46.404
Whoa whoa. I had the best style.

16:46.439 --> 16:47.705
I just didn't have the money.

16:47.741 --> 16:49.507
No.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.809
Okay, listen. It's fine.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.277
I'm just not
into fashion anymore.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.313
Okay? It's okay.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.615
Yeah, but this is Italy.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.451
Home to gucci, and prada,
and fendi.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.687
Listen, allison.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.789
I have other priorities right
now.

17:04.824 --> 17:07.191
Not shopping.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.459
And I don't
want to talk about it anymore.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.727
I'm gonna look over here.

17:09.763 --> 17:12.030
Oh, I didn't--

17:12.065 --> 17:15.266
I've already tried.
Just let it go.

17:15.335 --> 17:19.470
Ooh! This is so cute!

17:19.506 --> 17:20.872
Sugar ray would look
so adorable in this.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.974
Sugar ray.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.609
You should see
the way I dress him.

17:24.644 --> 17:27.412
People stop us and give me
compliments all the--

17:27.447 --> 17:29.747
I should start
a doggy clothing line.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.283
I can get all different fabrics.
I can make all these--

17:32.318 --> 17:34.152
you know what?
I'm gonna do that.

17:34.187 --> 17:36.254
I'm gonna start
a doggy clothing line,

17:36.289 --> 17:38.289
but I need to order
a sewing machine.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.892
Do you sew?

17:40.927 --> 17:42.860
I do not. I'm adding that
to the bucket list.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.869
-Oh.
-Mm.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.739
Oh, I have missed that smell.

17:54.808 --> 17:56.707
Homemade coconut chocolate chip.

17:56.776 --> 17:57.875
Your favorite.

17:57.944 --> 17:59.510
Mm-hmm.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.278
Did you tell nico yet?

18:02.482 --> 18:04.682
No. I do not want any pressure

18:04.717 --> 18:06.284
while making this decision.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.586
Oh, pressure.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.154
Like how you pressured me
to stay in the marines?

18:10.190 --> 18:12.423
I was looking at your big
picture.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.791
You could have retired
as a marine corps major.

18:13.827 --> 18:14.826
Well, what about
your big picture?

18:14.894 --> 18:17.295
Become a writer in Italy.

18:17.363 --> 18:20.331
I think that means...
Starting over,

18:20.366 --> 18:24.402
lower pay, no tenure.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.471
Well, actually, you know,

18:26.506 --> 18:27.772
starting over
could be a good thing.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.907
That's a good thing. That's a
pro.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.677
Yeah. And from what
you've told us, allison,

18:32.712 --> 18:34.745
you and nico, you seem to really
enjoy each other's company.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.881
Meanwhile, nico has a teenage
son

18:36.916 --> 18:39.884
who you've grown fond of.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.786
I will take that con and make
it pro.

18:41.821 --> 18:44.055
Thanks.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.290
This isn't helping.

18:46.359 --> 18:49.060
That's because the answer
isn't on there.

18:49.095 --> 18:51.229
It's in here.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.864
You're real corny today.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.099
It's actually here

18:55.135 --> 18:56.300
'cause it's four pros
and three cons.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.768
So that means the pros win.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.203
-Oh!
-Nico: Ciao, allison!

18:59.239 --> 19:02.039
-That's nico.
-Oh!

19:02.075 --> 19:03.074
-Hey!! There he is!
-Nico: Ciao.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.709
Nico!! Nice to meet you.

19:04.744 --> 19:05.776
Nice to meet you too.

19:05.812 --> 19:06.177
And I am melina!

19:12.418 --> 19:16.687
Mm.  Allison would always
talk about you.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.823
I could just hear her beaming
through the phone.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.791
And now I know why.

19:20.827 --> 19:21.359
Ah, beaming, huh?

19:24.664 --> 19:25.630
(reesa laughs)

19:27.634 --> 19:28.633
well...

19:28.701 --> 19:30.434
I love this wine.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.836
A wine connoisseur?

19:31.871 --> 19:33.337
No. I wish.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.705
I um, I just took some classes

19:34.774 --> 19:36.374
so I could be
familiar with the wines

19:36.442 --> 19:38.276
that we sell at my restaurant.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.210
Ah yeah, you are the chef.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.646
Yes.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.881
I'd love for you
to sample my cheeses.

19:43.917 --> 19:46.517
I see you say that
to all the ladies. (laughing)

19:46.553 --> 19:48.219
nico: She found me out.

19:48.288 --> 19:50.021
(laughing)

19:50.089 --> 19:53.724
melina: So,
how did you two meet?

19:53.760 --> 19:55.259
Allison:
The second week after I arrived,

19:55.295 --> 19:57.562
I went to the food market,

19:57.597 --> 19:58.896
and I just happened to see
nico's booth.

20:06.839 --> 20:07.405
He offered me samples
of his cheese.

20:13.012 --> 20:16.013
It was the best pecorino
I had ever had.

20:16.049 --> 20:19.650
I went back
and bought some more.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.953
She claims she came back
for more cheese,

20:21.988 --> 20:23.921
but what she really wanted
was my phone number.

20:23.957 --> 20:29.193
And now she cannot
stay away from my cheese.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.963
He's right. I even help out
at the booth sometimes.

20:31.998 --> 20:34.265
Awwww. You're such
a good girlfriend.

20:34.300 --> 20:38.369
What? Did I say something wrong?

20:38.404 --> 20:40.671
Well, we both agreed

20:40.707 --> 20:41.339
that since I'm only here
for a year,

20:41.374 --> 20:44.141
we would just date.

20:44.177 --> 20:47.111
So...We're not a couple.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.446
(reesa laughs)

20:48.481 --> 20:50.114
what?

20:50.149 --> 20:51.249
Well, I can call
a duck a frog,

20:51.284 --> 20:54.218
but it's still a duck.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.987
And all I'm hearing from
the two of you right now

20:56.022 --> 20:58.022
is quack! Quack!

20:58.057 --> 20:59.657
Quack! (all laughing)

20:59.692 --> 21:00.491
reesa!

21:11.404 --> 21:12.803
Are you okay?

21:12.839 --> 21:14.171
I'm fine, I just...

21:17.443 --> 21:19.777
I was a week late,
so I thought...(sighs)

21:22.682 --> 21:24.415
you thought you were pregnant?

21:24.484 --> 21:27.418
No. I just was hoping...

21:27.453 --> 21:28.653
Maybe.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.724
I didn't know you were
trying to have a baby.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.525
Why didn't you say anything?

21:34.560 --> 21:37.828
Because of this.

21:37.864 --> 21:38.696
People act all weird when
they know you're trying.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.164
Okay. I won't act weird.

21:40.199 --> 21:44.001
I promise. (squeals)

21:44.070 --> 21:45.569
I knew you couldn't help it.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.605
You're already doing it.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.440
We've been trying for a year,

21:49.509 --> 21:51.709
and andre really wants a family,
but I'm almost 40, so...

21:51.744 --> 21:55.946
Okay, janet jackson was 50,
and she had a baby.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.415
Janet jackson is a gazillionaire
and a goddess.

21:57.450 --> 22:02.119
True. But...So are you.

22:02.188 --> 22:06.357
Thanks. You know what?

22:06.392 --> 22:07.358
If it's meant to happen,
it will happen, right?

22:07.393 --> 22:09.593
Melina: Yes!

22:09.629 --> 22:11.495
At least in the meantime,
I can have one of these.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.297
Reesa, I'm going to be an
auntie!

22:13.333 --> 22:14.265
Oh god.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.608
Hello.

22:24.644 --> 22:27.745
Hi! Um, I'm melina.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.080
I guess we are cooking partners.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.114
Lucas williams.

22:30.183 --> 22:32.049
Oh!

22:32.085 --> 22:33.084
Sorry, it's what we do in
london.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.853
I'm just here visiting.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.022
Me too. I live in california.

22:38.091 --> 22:40.091
Mm-hmm.

22:40.126 --> 22:42.126
Let's see what we
are making today.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.928
Ooh. Ricotta and artichoke
ravioli.

22:43.963 --> 22:45.663
That sounds delicious.

22:45.698 --> 22:48.632
Eh, ciao a tutti.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.801
Welcome to cooking with
contaldo.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.770
Find your table,

22:52.805 --> 22:55.406
place on your aprons,

22:55.441 --> 22:57.775
and let's start our food
adventure.
(laughs)

22:59.345 --> 22:59.877
alright.

23:11.624 --> 23:14.158
You have to be
a little tough with it.

23:14.193 --> 23:17.528
Okay.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.164
Here, let me help you.

23:20.199 --> 23:22.700
You want to take the dough,

23:22.735 --> 23:25.536
and you want to use your heel,
the heel of your hand

23:25.571 --> 23:27.438
to push it away from you.

23:27.507 --> 23:30.374
And then,
you gradually add the flour.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.375
Oh. Thanks.

23:35.515 --> 23:38.149
You must have a lot
of experience with dough.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.016
Bread is one of my
guilty pleasures.

23:39.051 --> 23:42.319
At my restaurant,

23:42.355 --> 23:44.522
we actually make our dough
from scratch.

23:44.557 --> 23:45.956
Have you always wanted
to own a restaurant?

23:48.361 --> 23:52.062
It's been a desire of mine,

23:52.098 --> 23:53.864
and a health scare
a few years ago

23:53.900 --> 23:56.867
finally made me pull the
trigger.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.036
So, what's your favorite dish?

23:59.105 --> 24:01.972
Well, everything's excellent.
(laughs)

24:02.008 --> 24:04.742
no, um, I would say, oh,

24:04.777 --> 24:05.776
the flatbread with
shrimp and romesco sauce.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.945
Okay.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.514
Yours?

24:10.550 --> 24:12.516
Well, my dad
started me in the kitchen

24:12.552 --> 24:13.484
as soon as I was old enough
for trousers

24:13.519 --> 24:16.353
so I have many.

24:16.422 --> 24:18.722
But it has to be his brisket
patty
melt cornbread sandwich.

24:22.929 --> 24:26.497
Okay. You put the brisket
inside the cornbread?

24:26.532 --> 24:27.531
And smother it in swiss cheese.

24:30.303 --> 24:32.369
Hmm. You know,
I can't believe it,

24:32.405 --> 24:33.137
but that actually sounds
pretty good.

24:33.206 --> 24:34.705
Mm-hmm.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.106
Kneading is done.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.708
Time to cover.

24:37.743 --> 24:40.277
Alright.

24:40.313 --> 24:42.213
Put it in here.

24:42.281 --> 24:42.913
Good job.

24:45.318 --> 24:48.085
I love roasting these with
lemons.

24:48.120 --> 24:52.556
Yeah, but have you ever had
sunflower
artichoke turnovers?

24:52.592 --> 24:55.659
What? No.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.695
Well, I have to admit
I'm obsessed with sunflowers.

24:57.763 --> 25:00.331
I'm googling them all the time,

25:00.366 --> 25:01.899
and one time this recipe just
popped up on my browser.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.068
Uh-huh.

25:04.103 --> 25:07.071
I've been eating them ever
since.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.807
Well, you have to share
that recipe.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.175
Maybe over dinner?

25:15.882 --> 25:18.716
Well, um, my schedule
is kind of tight.

25:18.751 --> 25:21.986
So I'm not really sure about
dinner,

25:22.021 --> 25:24.121
but I will definitely
give you the recipe.

25:24.156 --> 25:24.955
Fair enough.

25:33.766 --> 25:34.999
Hi, pretty.

25:42.642 --> 25:42.806
I'm going to send an email to
dr. Barnes about staying.

25:46.712 --> 25:47.912
Another year is not going to
make it easier to leave.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.847
Shouldn't I just cut my losses?

25:49.882 --> 25:51.282
No. Anything can happen
in a year. Just send it.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.555
Fine.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.423
Remember when I told you

25:59.458 --> 26:00.558
that Italy looks really good
on you?

26:00.593 --> 26:02.159
Yeah.

26:02.194 --> 26:03.694
So, I've been thinking that

26:03.729 --> 26:06.463
maybe that's what I need.

26:06.499 --> 26:07.298
You like this place?

26:10.469 --> 26:12.436
Are you gonna move here?

26:12.505 --> 26:14.204
What does andre say?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.640
I haven't told him.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.042
I think I need some time alone

26:18.110 --> 26:18.943
to just, just figure things out.

26:18.978 --> 26:19.677
Reesa?

26:23.082 --> 26:25.849
Are you serious?
What's there to figure out?

26:25.885 --> 26:28.852
You know what?
Nothing that will get solved
today.

26:28.888 --> 26:31.055
Let's just, let's focus
on your email.

26:31.123 --> 26:31.822
I actually have the perfect
intro.
It, uh--

26:31.857 --> 26:32.990
you ready?

26:33.025 --> 26:34.491
Dear dr. Barnes.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.494
Peace out.

26:37.563 --> 26:40.564
(reesa laughs)

26:40.600 --> 26:41.398
(watch phone rings)

26:41.434 --> 26:42.366
oh.

26:42.401 --> 26:44.501
That's andre.

26:44.537 --> 26:46.804
(watch phone continues ringing)

26:46.839 --> 26:49.840
you should take that.

26:49.909 --> 26:51.308
Don't tell him about the
apartment
until you're sure.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.143
Right.

26:53.212 --> 26:53.944
(watch phone continues ringing)

26:56.916 --> 26:58.782
yes, andre.

26:58.818 --> 27:01.352
Yeah, um, I'm looking at
ten or so boxes

27:01.420 --> 27:03.087
all addressed to you.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.422
Baby, what is all this stuff?

27:05.458 --> 27:06.924
I just ordered
some gardening tools,

27:06.959 --> 27:08.125
and a small video camera.

27:08.194 --> 27:10.327
And some exercise equipment

27:10.363 --> 27:11.862
and canvases for our painting
classes.

27:11.897 --> 27:14.031
And I also just ordered
a sewing machine,

27:14.100 --> 27:15.666
but it's probably not there yet

27:15.701 --> 27:18.402
because guess what?

27:18.437 --> 27:20.137
I'm starting
a doggie clothing line.

27:20.206 --> 27:22.740
A what?

27:22.775 --> 27:24.208
A clothing line for dogs.

27:24.243 --> 27:26.477
Where's sugar ray?

27:26.512 --> 27:28.545
You know,
I haven't seen him in days.

27:28.614 --> 27:30.814
Maybe he's trapped
behind all of these boxes.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.249
Okay, that's not funny, andre.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.283
So, I'm requesting...

27:36.856 --> 27:39.823
That I extend my international
teaching position another

27:39.859 --> 27:44.194
additional two semesters

27:44.263 --> 27:48.032
so that I may finish
my research on the matter.

27:48.067 --> 27:52.903
Yours truly, dr. Allison cooper.

27:52.972 --> 27:54.672
Finished!

27:54.707 --> 27:55.305
Am I doing too much?

27:58.244 --> 28:00.711
Huh?

28:00.746 --> 28:02.146
I was just talking to andre
about my new interests.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.014
Uh-huh.

28:04.050 --> 28:04.682
And he said I was doing
ôthe most'.

28:04.717 --> 28:07.184
Well...

28:07.219 --> 28:09.386
Well, what?

28:09.455 --> 28:13.123
You do be experimenting a lot.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.426
It's called a bucket list!

28:15.461 --> 28:16.694
It's what you do when you
retire.

28:16.729 --> 28:18.696
What else am I supposed to do?

28:18.731 --> 28:21.065
Okay, don't get salty with me.
You asked me.

28:21.133 --> 28:21.899
This apartment
is looking better and better.

28:29.608 --> 28:30.974
Send it. Just send it.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.576
Reesa: Just send it!

28:37.383 --> 28:38.282
Please don't let me lose my job.

28:46.559 --> 28:48.525
Joseph tate, the food critic

28:48.561 --> 28:50.394
will visit tapas next Monday.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.563
You couldn't push it back?

28:52.631 --> 28:55.799
Well, they said yes,
but apparently no.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.000
I've gotta go back home.

28:57.036 --> 28:59.737
No. You can't.

28:59.772 --> 29:01.472
Eileen is still the manager,
right?
Let her do it.

29:01.540 --> 29:03.040
Eileen quit.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.375
She wanted a raise,

29:05.411 --> 29:06.643
and I couldn't afford to give
her one.

29:06.679 --> 29:08.045
So who's the manager?

29:08.114 --> 29:09.513
This new guy, edward,

29:09.548 --> 29:11.148
who I do not trust yet.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.750
Okay, you know what, mr. Tate,

29:12.785 --> 29:14.618
he doesn't come until Monday,

29:14.653 --> 29:17.588
so I'll just fly back on Friday.

29:17.623 --> 29:19.490
Allison, she'll just
have to understand.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.458
Buongiorno!

29:21.494 --> 29:24.094
Both: Good morning! Hi!

29:24.130 --> 29:26.764
Hey. What's going on?

29:26.799 --> 29:28.766
Oh, nothing.

29:28.801 --> 29:30.400
I was just about
to leave for class.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.336
We are going
to the spice market today.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.071
You know what,
I'm running late.

29:34.140 --> 29:36.440
So, I'm just gonna
meet you guys

29:36.475 --> 29:36.774
at the vineyard later, okay?
Bye for now!

29:36.809 --> 29:37.641
Bye.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.546
Well, hi. You look great.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.683
No reply from dr. Barnes.

29:46.719 --> 29:48.852
I hope I didn't upset him.

29:48.888 --> 29:51.021
You just sent the email.
Give him some time.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.090
He's got you so shook.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.591
I'm not used to seeing you
like this.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.627
He's the chancellor.
He has a lot of power.

29:56.695 --> 29:58.829
And I am this close
to getting tenured.

29:58.864 --> 30:00.430
Okay, you are overthinking
this whole thing.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.900
You need to calm down.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.501
And we need
to take your mind off it.

30:04.537 --> 30:07.938
Why don't we
do one of your cool posts?

30:07.973 --> 30:09.439
You can speak, and I'll be your
background dancer.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.108
We can put it on tik tok.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.609
Uh, no. We're not doing that.

30:12.678 --> 30:14.478
What about this?

30:14.513 --> 30:16.580
No. No. And aren't we
too old for tik tok?

30:16.649 --> 30:18.315
We can ride vespas.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.984
I am not getting on a vespa.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.653
Take your life
into your hands if you want to.

30:22.721 --> 30:25.355
Okay, you're just as bad
as andre.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.524
Okay.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.294
Are you ready
to talk about him?

30:30.329 --> 30:33.764
Sure. He criticizes
everything that I do.

30:33.799 --> 30:35.632
I planned this whole list
of stuff for us,

30:35.668 --> 30:37.568
and he doesn't want to do
any of it.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.736
He doesn't want to spend time
with me.

30:39.772 --> 30:42.806
And that doesn't feel good.

30:42.842 --> 30:43.407
Reesa, I know andre loves you.

30:46.779 --> 30:47.845
You need to tell him
how you feel, reesa.

30:47.913 --> 30:49.646
Yeah, it's fine.
And I'm fine.

30:49.682 --> 30:52.749
No. Reesa...

30:52.785 --> 30:52.916
Seriously, why don't we just
do this video. Come on.

31:04.830 --> 31:07.965
I mean, look at this fruit.
It's all so fresh.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.399
Yes.

31:09.435 --> 31:11.368
Yeah. Look at this.

31:11.403 --> 31:13.871
You know, being here

31:13.939 --> 31:16.240
makes me want to try
all new kinds of recipes.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.108
My dad would love this place.

31:18.143 --> 31:20.911
He's a chef too, you know.

31:20.946 --> 31:22.946
We hoped my daughter noelle
would've
followed in our footsteps.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.182
But not even a chance.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.717
She wants to be
a makeup artist.

31:26.785 --> 31:30.354
Oh, she's beautiful.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.789
It's been just the two of us
for the last ten years

31:32.825 --> 31:35.125
since my wife passed.

31:35.194 --> 31:37.728
She's my baby
even though she's turning 21.

31:37.763 --> 31:38.762
I see you. Proud papa.

31:38.831 --> 31:40.831
Mm-hmm.

31:40.866 --> 31:43.967
Well, you know,
I'm really glad I came.

31:44.003 --> 31:45.402
I needed this break.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.638
And I had fun yesterday.

31:47.706 --> 31:50.374
Me too.

31:50.409 --> 31:53.477
I guess we should see what
we need to buy for class.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.312
Oh, look. Spices.

31:55.347 --> 31:58.148
And here we are.

31:58.183 --> 32:01.084
Yeah, me too, but...

32:01.120 --> 32:02.753
Mine are different from yours,

32:02.788 --> 32:03.954
and I haven't used
half of these.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.256
Oh, wow.

32:06.325 --> 32:07.891
I used to love experimenting
with different spices.

32:07.960 --> 32:11.361
But owning a restaurant

32:11.430 --> 32:12.729
gives you limited time
to experiment.

32:17.036 --> 32:19.336
Okay, so what if I
challenged you today?

32:22.474 --> 32:24.308
Get all the things on our cards.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.977
Mm-hmm.

32:27.012 --> 32:28.378
And buy three more spices
you've never used.

32:28.414 --> 32:29.313
Challenge accepted.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.014
Okay.

32:31.050 --> 32:33.317
And you know what?

32:33.352 --> 32:36.153
I actually see sage over here
which is on my list.

32:36.188 --> 32:39.256
Sage. Fresh sage.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.791
Which means one down.

32:40.826 --> 32:42.793
Five more to go.

32:42.828 --> 32:45.028
Whoa whoa whoa.
Hold on. Hold on.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.731
The first one to six,
to get all six spices

32:47.766 --> 32:49.032
takes the other one to dinner.

32:52.805 --> 32:54.905
Um, sorry, but is that your way

32:54.940 --> 32:56.406
of trying to ask me out
on a date again?

32:56.442 --> 33:00.243
Well, only if you're saying yes.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.212
(melina chuckles)

33:02.247 --> 33:04.982
well, I'm already
one spice ahead of you,

33:05.017 --> 33:06.016
so you better hurry up.

33:06.051 --> 33:07.951
(lucas sighs)

33:07.987 --> 33:11.121
oh, and look at that.
I have two.

33:11.156 --> 33:11.722
Just what I was looking for.
That is on my list.

33:11.757 --> 33:13.590
Oh, come on.

33:13.625 --> 33:13.924
I'll have this please.

33:19.431 --> 33:22.399
This region has a history
of over 1000 years.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.935
This vineyard was a etruscan
and roman settlement.

33:24.970 --> 33:26.269
And we will be having
our tasting inside.

33:31.877 --> 33:33.443
You've been on your phone
all day.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.445
Are you going to tell me
what's going on?

33:35.481 --> 33:37.981
Oh, nothing. I just had to
handle some work stuff.

33:38.050 --> 33:39.783
-I'll put it away. Sorry.
-That's okay.

33:39.852 --> 33:40.784
Okay. Let's go.

33:43.756 --> 33:46.023
You know, wine tasting
is really not that hard.

33:46.058 --> 33:47.324
But every little step counts.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.426
The way that I learned it

33:49.461 --> 33:51.294
was at first
you swirl the wine around

33:51.330 --> 33:52.396
in your glass just like that.
Yeah.

33:52.431 --> 33:54.631
Maybe a little bit more.

33:54.700 --> 33:57.434
And then you have to smell it
before you taste it.

33:57.503 --> 34:00.003
Because the smell
is connected to the taste.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.305
It's called old factory.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.274
Hold it up to the light,

34:04.309 --> 34:05.409
you can see the depth
of the wine.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.476
It's got this crimson color.

34:06.545 --> 34:08.412
Here's how I figured it.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.415
-Alli.
-Hi.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.050
This is my cousin mario.

34:13.085 --> 34:13.850
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Oh, hi.

34:13.886 --> 34:14.684
His lovely wife, emilia.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.353
Hi.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.488
And this is my allison.

34:18.557 --> 34:21.425
-Hi. Oh.
-Oh!

34:21.460 --> 34:23.193
We've been traveling
so much this year,

34:23.228 --> 34:24.561
but finally,
we get to meet you.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.630
Nico, she's beautiful.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.799
Nico: I know.

34:28.834 --> 34:32.602
Oh, well, your vineyard
is gorgeous.

34:32.638 --> 34:33.870
You have to come back
in September

34:33.906 --> 34:35.772
when we do our grape stomping.

34:35.808 --> 34:37.007
Right. There's nothing
more romantic

34:37.042 --> 34:38.742
than getting
in a barrel of grapes

34:38.811 --> 34:40.877
and making wine together.

34:40.913 --> 34:41.812
Hopefully, she'll still be here.

34:41.847 --> 34:44.147
What?

34:44.183 --> 34:46.750
Well, I have a job. Teaching
job back in the states.

34:46.785 --> 34:47.984
So I may not be able
to come back.

34:48.053 --> 34:49.886
-Oh.
-No. Look at you two.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.855
I have to see more of this.

34:51.890 --> 34:54.291
You can't go.

34:54.326 --> 34:55.692
You'll be at the hunt
tomorrow, yeah?

34:55.727 --> 34:57.160
Yeah.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.896
Uh, yeah.

34:59.932 --> 35:02.899
Yes. And we will talk more about
this leaving nonsense.

35:02.935 --> 35:05.669
-Good idea.
-Alright.

35:05.704 --> 35:06.937
-Enjoy!
-Ciao!

35:06.972 --> 35:07.537
-Ciao!
-Ciao!

35:10.142 --> 35:11.007
My mom can't wait
to meet you.

35:11.043 --> 35:13.844
Nico...

35:13.912 --> 35:15.545
I am more nervous
about meeting your mother

35:15.581 --> 35:17.581
than I was about meeting
lorenzo.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.016
Oh, no. She's harmless.

35:20.052 --> 35:21.151
Invite reesa and melina too
if you want.

35:21.186 --> 35:23.487
Everyone is welcome.

35:23.522 --> 35:26.523
Yeah, I will.
Um, have you seen melina?

35:26.592 --> 35:28.925
No. Not since she
stepped out before.

35:28.961 --> 35:29.292
I'll be right back.

35:32.264 --> 35:33.930
Tell the  chef to create
a limited menu

35:33.999 --> 35:36.199
with the dishes that I texted
you.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.135
Just please make sure we have
all of the ingredients, okay?

35:38.170 --> 35:39.669
My flight lands Saturday night.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.907
Hey. I've been looking for you.

35:43.942 --> 35:46.076
Oh, um, yeah, edward.

35:46.111 --> 35:48.645
Thanks for checking in, okay?

35:48.680 --> 35:49.579
And please call me
if you need anything, alright?

35:49.648 --> 35:52.115
Okay, bye.

35:52.151 --> 35:54.951
Whew! Restaurant business.

35:54.987 --> 35:57.120
You know it's always something.

35:57.156 --> 35:58.421
What's up?

35:58.457 --> 35:59.422
You tell me.

36:03.328 --> 36:03.960
I have to leave on Friday.

36:03.996 --> 36:06.363
What? Why?

36:06.431 --> 36:08.365
The taste of the town critic

36:08.433 --> 36:10.167
is coming for dinner
on Monday night,

36:10.235 --> 36:12.469
and I just wanna make sure
everything's right.

36:12.538 --> 36:12.969
Girl, you're the boss.
Delegate.

36:14.706 --> 36:17.040
Well, look, if I'm not there,

36:17.075 --> 36:19.009
I could get a bad review.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.977
And anything less than 5 stars
could sink me.

36:21.013 --> 36:23.013
There you ladies are.

36:23.081 --> 36:24.915
I just bought a book

36:24.950 --> 36:26.416
on how to become a sommelier!

36:26.451 --> 36:27.584
Not right now, reesa.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.219
The melina I know

36:29.254 --> 36:30.654
would have already
bought a frame

36:30.689 --> 36:32.856
for her 5-star review.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.926
Yeah, well, that melina was
na•ve.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.827
And this melina
has been through a lot.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.564
No, no, no. I know.
I understand.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.567
No, you do not understand,
allison.

36:43.602 --> 36:47.204
Listen, tapas is the only thing
that I have,

36:47.239 --> 36:47.337
and it has to be successful.

36:50.842 --> 36:51.641
I mean, I put
my blood, sweat and tears

36:51.677 --> 36:54.110
into that restaurant, okay?

36:54.146 --> 36:55.579
And if I get a bad review
in that magazine,

36:55.614 --> 36:56.079
I could lose everything.

36:58.650 --> 37:01.952
Oh, my gosh.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.153
I'm changing my flight,
and that's that, so just...

37:23.375 --> 37:28.044
Son: What do you even wear
to a truffle hunt anyway?

37:28.080 --> 37:30.046
You haven't mentioned melina
all morning.

37:30.115 --> 37:32.649
Melina's leaving.
What is there to say?

37:32.684 --> 37:34.618
You could be more supportive.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.953
She doesn't always confide in
me.

37:36.989 --> 37:38.555
It's hard to support
what I don't understand.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.357
You know
you should talk to her, right?

37:40.392 --> 37:41.891
She's always wanted to impress
you. You know that.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.327
She doesn't have to do that.
I'm her friend.

37:44.363 --> 37:45.662
A friend with high expectations.

37:48.333 --> 37:49.633
Oh. Well.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.536
What is that supposed to mean?

37:53.572 --> 37:55.105
Okay, look,
you were disappointed in me

37:55.173 --> 37:56.539
when I didn't go for that
promotion.

37:56.575 --> 37:57.741
I want the best
for the people I care about.

37:57.809 --> 38:00.710
What's wrong with that?

38:00.746 --> 38:02.279
It just doesn't leave
a lot of room for error.

38:02.314 --> 38:04.381
To be fair,

38:04.416 --> 38:05.582
melina isn't always honest
with me,

38:05.617 --> 38:07.217
so, I was blindsided

38:07.252 --> 38:08.585
when she said she was leaving.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.520
Yes. I...I know.

38:12.658 --> 38:13.490
What?

38:16.128 --> 38:18.695
-Tapas is not doing well.
-What?

38:18.730 --> 38:19.596
And she doesn't want you
to know.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.198
Why?

38:22.234 --> 38:23.233
Because you're...
Because you're judgy.

38:23.268 --> 38:26.002
Ish.

38:26.038 --> 38:28.805
Okay, first I have high
expectations,

38:28.840 --> 38:30.173
and now I'm judgy?
Thanks a lot, reesa.

38:30.242 --> 38:34.044
No--I. Look I'm just trying
to clear the air.

38:34.079 --> 38:35.211
So that we can enjoy
the last few days

38:35.247 --> 38:37.647
that melina is here.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.382
And I made an appointment
to see that apartment.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.618
Do not...

38:41.653 --> 38:42.752
Say a word.

38:44.756 --> 38:45.455
Okay.

38:49.294 --> 38:49.993
That's what you should wear
to the truffle hunt.

38:52.864 --> 38:53.363
(inaudible chatter)

38:55.967 --> 38:57.033
he adores you.

39:01.940 --> 39:02.372
-How are you?
-Good.

39:04.776 --> 39:05.475
Hello, reesa.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.980
Mama. May I present allison.

39:11.016 --> 39:13.216
(speaking italian)

39:13.251 --> 39:14.317
alli, mama.

39:14.386 --> 39:15.518
Oh, charmed!

39:19.324 --> 39:20.256
And her friend reesa.

39:20.325 --> 39:20.523
Nice to meet you. Oh!

39:23.261 --> 39:24.627
Lorenzo.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.463
-Ah!
-Reesa.

39:26.498 --> 39:27.997
-Nice to meet you!
-Hello.

39:28.066 --> 39:32.369
Lorenzo! (inaudible)

39:32.404 --> 39:33.236
would you show our guest around?

39:33.305 --> 39:35.171
Of course.

39:35.207 --> 39:37.774
-Thank you.
-Okay.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.676
You make my son very happy,

39:39.745 --> 39:41.378
and that makes me very happy.

39:41.413 --> 39:42.979
Oh...

39:43.048 --> 39:44.247
Bambini venete.

39:44.282 --> 39:45.448
Andiamo.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.186
What?

39:50.222 --> 39:53.289
Uh, melina's coming from class,

39:53.325 --> 39:55.291
so she's gonna be a little late.

39:55.327 --> 39:56.726
No worries, alli.
We're in Italy.

39:56.762 --> 39:57.861
We don't have schedules.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.230
Oh, that's right.

40:00.265 --> 40:02.999
You know, I knew
I'd learn a lot in our class,

40:03.034 --> 40:05.635
but I had no idea
it would be this much fun.

40:05.670 --> 40:08.571
Well, chef is very entertaining,

40:08.607 --> 40:10.740
and you, my dear,

40:10.776 --> 40:11.141
how do we say, um,
blinding.

40:15.213 --> 40:18.448
Well, I hope òblindingó
means something good.

40:18.483 --> 40:20.750
How would you say?

40:20.786 --> 40:21.951
I think in america
you guys say,

40:21.987 --> 40:22.285
something like uh, awesome?

40:24.956 --> 40:27.223
Yeah, you're right.
I am pretty blinding.

40:27.259 --> 40:29.659
(both chuckle)

40:29.694 --> 40:33.596
but that's only because my
partner
is blinding too.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.932
Hmm. So let's keep that going.

40:35.967 --> 40:38.435
Okay.

40:38.470 --> 40:41.104
And take a look over there.

40:44.309 --> 40:45.708
(gasps)

40:45.777 --> 40:48.411
sunflowers!

40:48.447 --> 40:49.979
-It is.
-Oh my gosh! Look!

40:50.015 --> 40:53.249
No more excuses.

40:53.285 --> 40:55.385
I need to taste
those sunflower artichokes.

40:55.420 --> 40:57.353
Oh!

40:57.389 --> 40:59.889
How can you not love these
flowers?

40:59.958 --> 41:01.624
I mean, look, they stand so
tall.

41:01.660 --> 41:04.227
And no matter the weather,

41:04.262 --> 41:05.061
they always find the sunlight.

41:10.035 --> 41:11.201
(squeals) I love ôem!

41:15.373 --> 41:17.474
(allison laughs)

41:17.509 --> 41:19.609
everybody here is so welcoming.

41:19.644 --> 41:22.011
You're making it so hard
for me to leave.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.214
Nothing more from your school?

41:24.249 --> 41:27.717
Oh, dr. Barnes replied
right before I came here.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.152
He's calling me at 8:30 our
time.

41:29.187 --> 41:31.554
Hoping for good news.

41:31.590 --> 41:32.722
(allison giggles)

41:32.757 --> 41:38.194
I was thinking

41:38.230 --> 41:40.063
that we could go to sanducci
at the end of the month.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.332
Hmm.

41:42.367 --> 41:43.833
I could show you
where I was born,

41:43.869 --> 41:45.001
and you could meet
more of my family.

41:45.070 --> 41:48.538
I...

41:48.573 --> 41:50.673
I know there is a possibility
that
you are still leaving, but...

41:50.709 --> 41:53.810
So, should we keep
getting closer

41:53.845 --> 41:54.310
when there's that chance?

41:54.346 --> 41:57.780
Okay, but...

41:57.816 --> 41:57.847
You're happy when we are
together?

42:00.585 --> 42:02.619
Yes. (laughs) of course I am.

42:05.557 --> 42:06.556
There is a saying
that I hold very dear.

42:06.591 --> 42:09.158
And it's uh,

42:09.194 --> 42:12.195
non rimpiangere mai cié

42:12.264 --> 42:14.230
che ti ha fatto sorridere.

42:14.266 --> 42:14.964
Uh...

42:17.869 --> 42:19.903
Never regret anything
that made you smile.

42:19.938 --> 42:21.471
Exactly.

42:21.506 --> 42:26.342
I-oh. Ooh. Sorry.

42:26.411 --> 42:28.711
I was just,
I was doing a cheese tour,

42:28.747 --> 42:29.913
and I came to tell you
I tasted your pecorino.

42:29.948 --> 42:32.849
It changed my life.

42:32.884 --> 42:35.218
(laughs)
meet the ones responsible.

42:35.253 --> 42:37.153
This is lua, lia, gia, and emma.

42:37.188 --> 42:39.856
Ladies, this is reesa.

42:39.925 --> 42:41.491
Oh, well, I won't
remember your names,

42:41.560 --> 42:42.992
but nice to meet you, ladies.

42:43.061 --> 42:46.162
These are his real girlfriends.

42:46.197 --> 42:48.264
I'm going to start
gathering the group

42:48.333 --> 42:49.399
so we can be ready
when melina arrives, okay?

42:49.467 --> 42:51.034
Oh, okay.

42:51.069 --> 42:51.501
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

42:54.639 --> 42:56.739
Everyone here is so chill.

42:56.775 --> 42:58.141
We were supposed to start
an hour ago.

42:58.209 --> 42:59.542
Yeah, they don't care
about that here.

42:59.578 --> 43:01.244
Well, that would drive me crazy,

43:01.279 --> 43:04.180
but um, you seem to be adapting

43:04.215 --> 43:05.381
to the laid- back farm life
pretty well.

43:05.450 --> 43:07.684
(laughs) you know, months ago,

43:07.752 --> 43:09.719
I had this really stressful day,

43:09.754 --> 43:11.721
and nico brought me here.

43:11.756 --> 43:12.755
He told me thirty minutes
with the animals,

43:12.791 --> 43:14.524
and I would forget everything.

43:14.559 --> 43:18.494
And he was right.
Emma is my favorite. Hi!

43:18.530 --> 43:21.264
Oh, you got a favorite sheep?
Come on.

43:21.299 --> 43:23.166
-Look who I found.
-I made it.

43:23.234 --> 43:26.869
So, meet rosaria and eve, our
guide.

43:26.905 --> 43:28.871
We let them roam,
and when you see them

43:28.907 --> 43:30.673
stop and start to dig,

43:30.709 --> 43:32.442
they've probably
found a truffle.

43:32.477 --> 43:34.711
Hurry to the spot
and grab it

43:34.746 --> 43:37.614
before they run off with it.
That's so simple.

43:37.649 --> 43:39.649
(laughing)
nico: You know the rules,

43:39.718 --> 43:40.617
the team with the least amount
of truffles

43:40.685 --> 43:42.585
has to cook dinner.

43:42.654 --> 43:43.519
Tour guide:
Good luck, everybody!

43:43.555 --> 43:44.721
Alright! (cheering)

43:47.492 --> 43:48.825
(all laughing)

43:55.700 --> 43:57.433
(group talking and cheering)

44:01.840 --> 44:05.875
yay! Ohh! (cheering)

44:05.910 --> 44:06.409
(laughter)

44:21.026 --> 44:22.091
I hope you're not disappointed
that we lost.

44:22.127 --> 44:25.228
I lose every year.

44:25.263 --> 44:28.064
-I prefer to make dinner.
(allison laughs)

44:28.133 --> 44:30.833
lucky me, this year
both of my ladies are cooking.

44:35.373 --> 44:38.074
Truffles are very interesting.

44:38.109 --> 44:40.076
I call them the food of love.

44:40.145 --> 44:43.112
First...

44:43.148 --> 44:46.749
They take a lot of patience
to really mature.

44:46.785 --> 44:49.352
Second. They require a partner.

44:51.990 --> 44:53.022
A partner?

44:53.058 --> 44:56.159
Yes.

44:56.194 --> 45:00.830
Without the tree's root
nourishing the soil,

45:00.899 --> 45:01.664
the truffle will die. Hmm.

45:05.837 --> 45:07.670
This is ready to go?

45:07.706 --> 45:09.572
Uh, yes.

45:11.476 --> 45:14.243
Everything is done.

45:14.279 --> 45:16.479
Great. Dinner's ready,
everybody!

45:21.152 --> 45:23.786
There's one more comparison.

45:23.822 --> 45:27.890
Uh...I've forgotten,
but it will come.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.128
(inaudible chatter and laughter)

45:38.002 --> 45:39.435
this chicken is amazing.

45:39.471 --> 45:40.336
(more chatter and laughter)

45:44.375 --> 45:47.210
oh, yes. I remember now.

45:47.245 --> 45:50.313
Truffles are like love

45:50.348 --> 45:52.849
because they are easy
to overlook.

45:52.884 --> 45:55.818
You could be standing
right on top

45:55.854 --> 45:58.154
of one of nature's precious
diamonds

45:58.223 --> 46:01.124
and not even realize it

46:01.192 --> 46:04.827
because you are not looking
in the right place.

46:09.234 --> 46:09.832
You need anything?

46:13.037 --> 46:15.104
Yeah, I'm just enjoying...

46:15.173 --> 46:17.306
Your family,

46:17.342 --> 46:20.510
and...My friends.

46:23.648 --> 46:26.082
And you.

46:26.117 --> 46:30.019
This moment is...Perfecto.

46:30.054 --> 46:31.320
(watch phone chimes)

46:31.356 --> 46:35.625
oh. I gotta go do my call.

46:35.660 --> 46:36.526
Fingers crossed.

46:57.348 --> 46:59.348
Hi, chancellor.

46:59.384 --> 47:01.150
It's good to see you.

47:01.186 --> 47:03.786
Dr. Cooper, good to see you.

47:03.822 --> 47:05.588
It's wonderful to hear
things are going well there.

47:05.623 --> 47:08.891
We at north carolina a&t

47:08.927 --> 47:10.860
want to always leave
a great impression.

47:10.895 --> 47:13.296
Well, dr. Di grado and his team

47:13.331 --> 47:16.432
are very impressed
with my creative writing class,

47:16.467 --> 47:19.635
so uh, they have asked me
to stay another year.

47:19.671 --> 47:22.371
Of course, they do,
you're one of our brightest.

47:22.407 --> 47:24.707
The board and I
have discussed the position
there,

47:24.742 --> 47:26.042
but we feel
there's a greater need

47:26.077 --> 47:27.143
for you here on our campus.

47:27.178 --> 47:27.844
Okay.

47:30.548 --> 47:33.082
As chair of the english
department.

47:33.117 --> 47:36.886
I'm sorry. What?

47:36.921 --> 47:40.189
Dr. Ghazi is retiring early
for personal reasons,

47:40.225 --> 47:43.659
and he has endorsed you as a
candidate for his position.

47:43.695 --> 47:44.794
You will need to have
an interview with the board,

47:44.829 --> 47:46.495
but it's just a formality.

47:46.531 --> 47:49.899
You have my full recommendation,

47:49.934 --> 47:52.902
and I couldn't be more proud
to give you this standing.

47:52.937 --> 47:55.504
This will also secure your
tenure.

47:55.540 --> 47:56.572
Oh, wow.

47:59.477 --> 48:00.509
This is incredible.

48:03.481 --> 48:06.515
I will email you
the interview time.

48:06.551 --> 48:08.918
Right afterwards,
I'll need you back in the
office.

48:08.987 --> 48:09.952
Uh, right afterwards?

48:11.823 --> 48:13.923
Say, three weeks?

48:13.958 --> 48:16.559
Congratulations, dr. Cooper.

48:16.594 --> 48:17.126
See you soon.

48:21.099 --> 48:23.599
♪ give a little more space

48:23.635 --> 48:27.436
♪ come a little closer

48:27.505 --> 48:28.237
I can't believe somebody.
You better slow down.

48:32.210 --> 48:34.944
Oh! Oh!
Wasn't that worth the climb,
guys?

48:34.979 --> 48:37.246
Not worth it.

48:37.282 --> 48:39.081
Okay. Am I the only one
who's light- headed?

48:39.117 --> 48:41.017
Oh, oh!

48:41.052 --> 48:41.851
Come here, honey.
Come sit down.

48:41.886 --> 48:43.753
Okay.

48:43.821 --> 48:45.721
Rest here for a minute.
Come on.

48:45.790 --> 48:48.157
I'm just glad that you
and ree made up.

48:48.192 --> 48:50.126
I was not feeling that weird
energy.

48:50.161 --> 48:53.729
-I wasn't mad.
-It wasn't weird.

48:53.765 --> 48:55.698
Why were you up so early moving
around this morning?

48:55.733 --> 48:58.034
Actually I was up late
fussing with andre.

48:58.069 --> 49:00.036
He's refusing to take
the painting class,

49:00.071 --> 49:02.438
and then he had the nerve
to tell me I need therapy.

49:02.473 --> 49:03.673
He knows good and well
I do not do therapy.

49:03.741 --> 49:05.908
I take my problems to the altar.

49:05.944 --> 49:08.044
The altars don't have phds
though.

49:08.079 --> 49:08.911
-You keep playing with him.
-Okay.

49:11.249 --> 49:13.382
Are you good?

49:13.451 --> 49:14.817
Last night I was offered the
chair

49:14.852 --> 49:16.352
of the english department
at a&t.

49:16.421 --> 49:18.287
What?

49:18.323 --> 49:19.922
Congratulations!

49:19.958 --> 49:22.525
Yeah, I didn't mention it

49:22.560 --> 49:23.492
because I just wanted
to enjoy our time together.

49:23.528 --> 49:24.727
Look. It's just a test. Stay.

49:24.762 --> 49:27.229
It's a big salary leap.

49:27.298 --> 49:29.131
Guarantees my job until
retirement.

49:29.167 --> 49:31.600
Staying is too big of a risk.

49:31.636 --> 49:32.335
There's nothing wrong
with taking risks.

49:32.403 --> 49:35.037
Risks.

49:35.073 --> 49:36.405
Like apartment hunting alone
in Italy.

49:38.910 --> 49:41.077
Oh, what apartment?

49:41.145 --> 49:42.878
Okay, does andre know?

49:42.947 --> 49:43.512
-He--
-what about the baby?

49:43.548 --> 49:47.917
(gasps) a baby?

49:47.952 --> 49:49.185
Okay, see, this is why I don't
say anything to you.

49:49.220 --> 49:50.786
Because I knew you were
gonna freak out.

49:50.855 --> 49:52.188
Yeah, of course I'm freaking
out.

49:52.223 --> 49:53.522
You're leaving your husband.

49:53.558 --> 49:54.991
And you're having a baby?

49:55.026 --> 49:57.593
No! And I am not leaving andre.

49:57.628 --> 49:58.494
An apartment in Italy
sounds like you're leaving.

49:58.529 --> 50:02.298
Okay.

50:02.367 --> 50:04.400
How come you couldn't tell me
you were so unhappy?

50:04.435 --> 50:05.735
This cannot be happening.

50:05.770 --> 50:08.471
I am not unhappy!

50:08.506 --> 50:09.538
I'm dispirited!

50:10.975 --> 50:13.109
Dispirited?

50:13.144 --> 50:14.176
I've been doing
a lot of crosswords.

50:14.245 --> 50:16.379
Ma'am, a baby?

50:16.414 --> 50:17.747
We've been trying,
it hasn't been working,

50:17.782 --> 50:19.849
and I need a break from it all.

50:19.884 --> 50:21.517
And if you'd just stay,
I could live with you.

50:21.552 --> 50:25.788
Reesa. You need to talk
to your husband.

50:25.823 --> 50:27.323
When did we start
keeping all these secrets?

50:27.358 --> 50:27.923
I can't.

50:31.396 --> 50:33.162
Take a pretty picture!

50:33.197 --> 50:34.497
Reesa. Whoa!

50:39.137 --> 50:42.571
Reesa, look I'm not mad
at you, alright?

50:42.607 --> 50:44.040
I just wish you would've told
me about the apartment.

50:44.075 --> 50:45.374
That's all.

50:45.410 --> 50:47.843
It's not that.

50:47.879 --> 50:49.979
Allison is on her way to tell
dr. Digrado she's leaving.

50:50.014 --> 50:52.848
It's a mistake.

50:52.884 --> 50:56.886
I agree. But I don't want to
press her on this, okay?

50:56.921 --> 50:57.653
I mean, this trip has already
been a roller coaster.

51:01.392 --> 51:02.525
Allison said we've been keeping
secrets, and she's right.

51:02.560 --> 51:04.960
What happened to us?

51:04.996 --> 51:05.561
We used to tell each other
everything,

51:05.630 --> 51:06.328
and now we don't.

51:09.067 --> 51:10.633
Well, here's something
that you don't know.

51:13.404 --> 51:15.538
Lucas asked me to dinner.

51:15.573 --> 51:17.573
Twice.

51:17.642 --> 51:18.407
And why haven't you gone?

51:21.512 --> 51:22.478
You know what?
I'm texting him.

51:22.513 --> 51:23.779
-No!
-Yes.

51:23.815 --> 51:26.082
Oh, come on.

51:26.117 --> 51:27.216
You know I haven't been out
with anyone,

51:27.251 --> 51:29.585
you know,
since before I got sick.

51:29.654 --> 51:31.987
Look, if you mess up the date,
so what?

51:32.023 --> 51:33.456
After this week,
you never have to see him again.

51:36.828 --> 51:38.561
Even if I did want to go,

51:38.596 --> 51:39.895
it's not like I have
anything to wear.

51:39.931 --> 51:41.730
Uh, we can fix that.
I'm calling allison.

51:41.766 --> 51:42.264
No.

51:46.204 --> 51:47.603

52:01.886 --> 52:03.452
Oh my god!

52:03.488 --> 52:05.488
Yes, girl!!

52:05.556 --> 52:08.090
You're wearing that dress!

52:08.126 --> 52:10.259
You don't think it's too much?

52:10.294 --> 52:12.528
Um, that's the one.

52:12.563 --> 52:15.631
Yeah. You gotta look amazing.

52:15.666 --> 52:18.734
Yeah. (laughing)

52:18.769 --> 52:20.436
I feel like we should
take a picture.

52:20.471 --> 52:21.737
On three. Remember, like this.

52:21.772 --> 52:23.772
Ooh...

52:23.841 --> 52:26.008
Ready?

52:26.043 --> 52:28.344
And I'm totally
getting this outfit.

52:28.379 --> 52:29.545
Because it goes perfectly with
your yellow stilettos.

52:29.614 --> 52:32.648
Thanks!

52:32.683 --> 52:35.050
Melina, you are definitely
getting that dress.

52:35.086 --> 52:37.753
I don't know, I mean...

52:37.788 --> 52:40.022
No. It's on me.

52:40.057 --> 52:41.724
It's that sexy dress I
promised you.

52:41.792 --> 52:46.896
Allison. I love you.

52:46.931 --> 52:50.633
(both squealing) I can't believe
you're going on a date!

52:50.701 --> 52:52.501
I'm going on a date.

52:52.537 --> 52:54.236
-Yes, you are, honey.
-I am.

52:54.305 --> 52:55.237
-With that dress.

53:51.395 --> 53:53.629
Trust me,
this isn't easy for me.

53:53.664 --> 53:53.696
What do you
want me to do?

53:56.734 --> 53:58.000
I want you to stay.

53:58.069 --> 53:59.568
Don't do that, nico.

53:59.604 --> 54:02.438
You can stay here and...

54:02.506 --> 54:04.139
Write and teach part time
if you want or,

54:04.175 --> 54:06.342
you said that was your dream.

54:06.377 --> 54:08.344
But I had to put it aside

54:08.379 --> 54:09.745
to pay for my
ex-husband lionel's law school.

54:09.780 --> 54:12.648
When he left us, I had nothing.

54:12.717 --> 54:14.250
I had to go back to work.

54:14.285 --> 54:16.352
I had to go back to school.

54:16.387 --> 54:19.521
And I vowed I would
take care of me and mine.

54:19.557 --> 54:22.825
You're not gonna understand
this,
nico.

54:22.860 --> 54:24.994
But when you're a black woman,

54:25.062 --> 54:28.130
it takes extra clawing and
scratching,

54:28.199 --> 54:29.598
and many sleepless nights
just to get here.

54:33.037 --> 54:36.939
And I cannot sacrifice that
for anything.

54:36.974 --> 54:37.740
Or anyone.

54:40.244 --> 54:43.245
You're right.

54:43.281 --> 54:43.746
I will never understand
what you have been through.

54:50.454 --> 54:53.555
But we deserve a chance,
alli.

54:53.591 --> 54:57.092
Your dream deserves a chance.

54:57.128 --> 54:57.559
I just want to enjoy
the time we have left.

54:59.330 --> 55:01.397
But I'm not staying here.

55:01.465 --> 55:02.298
I can't.

55:08.439 --> 55:09.438
Okay.

55:22.953 --> 55:24.820
Thank you.

55:24.855 --> 55:26.488
(allison laughs loudly)

55:26.524 --> 55:29.191
I see you hot mama.

55:29.226 --> 55:32.294
I needed that makeover, okay?

55:32.330 --> 55:34.563
Thank you.

55:34.598 --> 55:36.799
How was your date?

55:36.867 --> 55:39.535
He ordered a bunch
of different appetizers

55:39.570 --> 55:40.836
to help me find new recipes
for tapas.

55:40.871 --> 55:42.204
He's so sweet.

55:42.239 --> 55:44.173
I know!

55:44.208 --> 55:45.307
But did you kiss him?

55:45.343 --> 55:47.276
Well...

55:47.311 --> 55:48.777
(all squealing)

55:48.813 --> 55:50.079
I knew it! I knew it!

55:54.885 --> 55:55.718
I'm so sorry I was tripping
about you leaving.

55:55.786 --> 55:57.286
Life happens.

55:57.321 --> 55:59.988
I get it.

56:00.024 --> 56:02.157
So, you're definitely taking
that job back home?

56:02.226 --> 56:06.195
Oh, yeah.

56:06.230 --> 56:08.497
I meet with the board today.

56:08.532 --> 56:12.534
Well, as long as you are doing
what you...

56:12.603 --> 56:14.803
Think is best.

56:14.839 --> 56:16.138
I am.

56:16.207 --> 56:17.773
And uh...

56:21.412 --> 56:22.811
(sighs) I think
we should get breakfast

56:22.847 --> 56:25.013
before we go to the museum.

56:25.049 --> 56:27.282
I'm gonna tell andre
about the apartment today.

56:27.318 --> 56:29.218
And we should probably get
mimosas.

56:36.193 --> 56:38.794
I can't believe you
actually have a lease.

56:38.829 --> 56:41.263
It's just six months.

56:41.298 --> 56:42.164
Plus I'm signing up
for painting classes,

56:42.233 --> 56:43.932
wine making, cheese making.

56:43.968 --> 56:45.868
Wow. You're going to be
so busy,

56:45.903 --> 56:46.468
you won't have time
to miss dre.

56:46.537 --> 56:47.703
That's the point.

56:47.738 --> 56:49.571
No.

56:49.640 --> 56:52.007
It's not the point, okay?

56:52.042 --> 56:53.509
You are supposed to miss him,
right, allison?

56:53.544 --> 56:55.978
I'm sorry, what?

56:56.013 --> 56:58.781
Dr. Barnes is sending me
department requirements.

56:58.816 --> 57:01.583
It's like I've already started
working.

57:01.619 --> 57:03.318
Wait. What are you gonna do

57:03.354 --> 57:04.219
if andre says
you can't move to Italy?

57:04.255 --> 57:06.488
He wouldn't.

57:06.524 --> 57:07.523
I think he'll be relieved
to have me out his hair.

57:07.591 --> 57:09.158
Well, when you do talk to him,

57:09.193 --> 57:10.726
try not to be defensive.

57:10.761 --> 57:13.195
Okay, listen more.

57:13.230 --> 57:15.063
Okay, ladies. This is my
eat, pray, reset time.

57:15.099 --> 57:17.966
Okay?

57:18.002 --> 57:20.035
What did dr. Di grado say
when you turned him down?

57:20.104 --> 57:22.838
He said that my loyalty is
admirable.

57:22.907 --> 57:26.642
And um, he gave me these letters
my students wrote me.

57:26.710 --> 57:27.910
They're choosing another
candidate tomorrow.

57:31.715 --> 57:34.483
Oh, wow, look at this one.

57:34.518 --> 57:36.585
Òdr. Cooper's
creative writing class

57:36.620 --> 57:38.921
òis not only analytical,
but it's also

57:38.956 --> 57:41.623
òtherapeutic. She allowed me

57:41.692 --> 57:43.525
òto tap into parts of my psyche
that I'd buried.Ó

57:43.561 --> 57:47.729
oh. Òi will forever be
a better communicator

57:47.798 --> 57:50.599
òand writer because of her.Ó
allison.

57:50.634 --> 57:52.234
This is so sweet.

57:52.269 --> 57:53.268
Have you looked at these?

57:53.304 --> 57:55.304
A few of them. Yeah.

57:55.372 --> 57:56.872
I'm sure allison
gets letters like this

57:56.907 --> 57:57.940
from all of her students.

57:58.008 --> 58:00.175
I don't. Actually.

58:00.211 --> 58:01.944
I just had a connection
with these students

58:01.979 --> 58:03.378
and what we were doing.

58:03.447 --> 58:05.614
When you get back home,

58:05.649 --> 58:07.583
I hope that you keep writing.

58:07.618 --> 58:09.685
Finish that book you started.

58:09.720 --> 58:12.254
Reesa: Yeah. You can make time.

58:12.323 --> 58:14.456
You know, I think if I
were meant to be an author,

58:14.492 --> 58:16.658
I would already have a book.

58:18.829 --> 58:20.762
So, as it stands,

58:20.798 --> 58:23.899
I am dr. Allison cooper.

58:23.934 --> 58:25.834
Tenured chair
of the english department.

58:25.870 --> 58:28.203
Enough said.

58:28.239 --> 58:30.172
Congratulations.

58:30.207 --> 58:31.006
Thanks.

58:37.114 --> 58:39.615
Melina: This is interesting.

58:39.650 --> 58:40.549
Reesa: You know what else
is interesting?

58:40.584 --> 58:43.886
I found a meditation class.

58:43.954 --> 58:45.754
The brochure said
it was life changing.

58:45.789 --> 58:49.591
Yeah. Meditation is great
for mental clarity.

58:49.627 --> 58:50.559
Yeah, I--

58:53.697 --> 58:56.698
hey. I know you've already
been here with nico,

58:56.734 --> 58:58.967
but you can pretend
to want to be here with us.

58:59.003 --> 59:00.102
Sorry. Work keeps texting me.

59:00.137 --> 59:02.471
I get it.

59:02.506 --> 59:04.406
We just kind of
want you to hang out with us.

59:04.441 --> 59:07.576
Yeah. Come on, allison.

59:07.611 --> 59:09.745
You know it's my last day here.

59:09.813 --> 59:11.046
Well, you cut your trip short
so...

59:11.115 --> 59:13.482
Ew, shade.

59:13.517 --> 59:15.584
No, I thought you said
you weren't upset with me?

59:15.619 --> 59:16.084
I'm not. But don't make me
feel guilty for working.

59:16.120 --> 59:18.453
That was reesa.

59:18.522 --> 59:20.422
You're not going to be happy
when you go back.

59:20.457 --> 59:22.691
Reesa, I have
a prestigious promotion,

59:22.726 --> 59:24.560
and a corner office.

59:24.628 --> 59:26.695
So. You're only taking the job

59:26.764 --> 59:28.163
because you're scared
to take a risk.

59:28.198 --> 59:30.165
Stop faking the funk.

59:30.234 --> 59:31.099
You should stay here, right,
melina?

59:31.135 --> 59:32.901
Only if she wants to.

59:32.937 --> 59:35.103
Are we doing this right now?

59:35.172 --> 59:38.206
Yes. You are scared
to take a chance with nico

59:38.242 --> 59:40.008
because of everything
that happened with lionel.

59:40.044 --> 59:43.645
I mean, come on, nico,
he's a good guy.

59:43.681 --> 59:45.380
Thank you. And you guys
look great together.

59:45.416 --> 59:47.382
And he treats you with respect.

59:47.418 --> 59:49.051
Okay, so you're staging
an intervention.

59:49.086 --> 59:50.819
-That is not--
-no, no, no. We are not.

59:50.854 --> 59:51.687
We are not, you know, but...

59:55.593 --> 59:57.726
Okay, okay, guys, guys!

59:57.761 --> 1:00:00.395
Stop, stop.
Listen, allison.

1:00:00.431 --> 1:00:01.930
This isn't about nico.

1:00:01.999 --> 1:00:04.733
Look, you're happy here.

1:00:04.802 --> 1:00:07.502
I can't follow every whim
that makes me happy.

1:00:07.538 --> 1:00:09.471
Staying here does not make
sense.

1:00:09.506 --> 1:00:12.107
I don't know any other way
to say it to you.

1:00:12.142 --> 1:00:13.141
I just want you to be honest
with yourself.

1:00:13.210 --> 1:00:16.345
Honest? Really?

1:00:16.380 --> 1:00:17.679
I think that's the pot
calling the kettle black

1:00:17.715 --> 1:00:19.514
because you two
have not been honest with me

1:00:19.550 --> 1:00:21.183
since you've been here.

1:00:21.218 --> 1:00:22.751
How have I not been honest?

1:00:22.786 --> 1:00:24.853
Yeah, what do you mean you two?

1:00:24.922 --> 1:00:26.655
Reesa told me
that your business is crumbling.

1:00:26.724 --> 1:00:28.957
And I warned you about
opening up a restaurant.

1:00:29.026 --> 1:00:30.325
I warned you,
but it wasn't practical

1:00:30.361 --> 1:00:32.094
and now you're in debt.

1:00:32.162 --> 1:00:34.196
Really, reesa? You told her?

1:00:34.231 --> 1:00:35.964
And reesa,
you're running around here

1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:37.966
doing fifty-eleven things

1:00:38.002 --> 1:00:40.602
when you need to be focused
on your issues.

1:00:40.638 --> 1:00:42.037
Now are you
being honest about that?

1:00:42.072 --> 1:00:43.238
Whoa whoa.
What are my issues?

1:00:43.273 --> 1:00:45.841
Enlighten me, please!

1:00:45.876 --> 1:00:47.643
Hey, guys, you know what,
we don't need to--

1:00:47.678 --> 1:00:48.710
no, no, no, no.
You think you know it all.

1:00:48.779 --> 1:00:50.912
And it's not just me.

1:00:50.948 --> 1:00:52.114
Melina says the same thing.
Right, melina?

1:00:52.149 --> 1:00:57.119
No, no. What I said,
you know was

1:00:57.187 --> 1:00:59.488
that reesa was having
a hard time focusing.

1:00:59.523 --> 1:01:01.790
Both: Same thing.

1:01:01.825 --> 1:01:03.291
Anyway, neither one of you can
tell me how to run my life

1:01:03.327 --> 1:01:07.496
when your life is in chaos.

1:01:07.564 --> 1:01:09.898
Chaos? That is strong.

1:01:09.933 --> 1:01:12.334
Yeah. Yeah. I told you.

1:01:12.369 --> 1:01:13.035
This is why I said
don't say anything.

1:01:13.070 --> 1:01:14.870
You do not speak to me.

1:01:14.905 --> 1:01:16.805
I need to go meditate.

1:01:19.643 --> 1:01:20.842
But it's my last day--

1:01:35.526 --> 1:01:36.692
mmm...

1:01:40.297 --> 1:01:42.831
Mmm...

1:01:45.235 --> 1:01:47.369
Mmm...

1:01:50.541 --> 1:01:51.973
Oh m...

1:02:05.389 --> 1:02:07.222
I want to work out a
long-distance
relationship with you

1:02:07.291 --> 1:02:09.624
because...

1:02:09.660 --> 1:02:10.325
Because I love you.

1:02:13.397 --> 1:02:15.764
And I'm gonna visit you
when school's out,

1:02:15.799 --> 1:02:17.532
and you can come for the
holidays.

1:02:17.568 --> 1:02:18.233
So...

1:02:20.337 --> 1:02:23.171
Oh, no. Not, not you.

1:02:41.959 --> 1:02:43.425
Grazie.

1:02:50.968 --> 1:02:53.001
(sighs)

1:02:53.070 --> 1:02:55.704
dr. Cooper. Good to see you.

1:02:55.739 --> 1:02:58.340
Oh, well,  it's good
to see everyone. (laughs)

1:02:58.375 --> 1:03:00.809
you know everyone on here, so
we can skip the formalities

1:03:00.844 --> 1:03:01.810
and jump right in.

1:03:01.845 --> 1:03:03.879
Sounds good.

1:03:03.947 --> 1:03:07.249
Why do you want to chair
the english department?

1:03:07.284 --> 1:03:08.116
I want to be chair
of the english department

1:03:08.152 --> 1:03:08.817
because um...

1:03:13.190 --> 1:03:16.124
Surely you know why you want
this.

1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:17.726
What are you passionate about?

1:03:24.635 --> 1:03:26.835
Melina:
Thanks for letting me come over.

1:03:26.870 --> 1:03:29.337
Do you mind if I hang out here
a little while longer?

1:03:29.373 --> 1:03:31.773
You know, if you do,

1:03:31.809 --> 1:03:32.541
I'm going to put you
to work, right?

1:03:36.413 --> 1:03:38.413
(chuckles) really?

1:03:38.448 --> 1:03:40.248
(laughs) I'm, hey...

1:03:47.124 --> 1:03:49.491
That's good.

1:03:49.560 --> 1:03:52.227
Thank you.

1:03:52.262 --> 1:03:53.094
It's even better
than I remember it tasting.

1:03:59.469 --> 1:04:02.304
Okay. I'm sorry.

1:04:02.339 --> 1:04:03.471
I didn't offend you, did I?

1:04:03.507 --> 1:04:04.272
No, no, no.

1:04:09.246 --> 1:04:10.979
It's just been hard for me
to connect with someone

1:04:11.014 --> 1:04:11.880
since I got sick.

1:04:15.419 --> 1:04:18.119
You never know when cancer
might come back,

1:04:18.155 --> 1:04:21.389
and the last thing I want
to be is a burden.

1:04:21.425 --> 1:04:24.092
Or worse, you know.

1:04:24.161 --> 1:04:25.694
Have someone staying with me
out of pity.

1:04:28.866 --> 1:04:32.601
Hmm. You know,
my mum got cancer when I was 16.

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:37.572
And I watched my dad
care for her every single day.

1:04:40.944 --> 1:04:43.111
She was only supposed to live
one year after her diagnosis,

1:04:43.146 --> 1:04:45.447
but she actually lived for
three,

1:04:45.482 --> 1:04:47.449
and I know it was because my dad
loved her so much.

1:04:49.686 --> 1:04:52.187
If I've learned nothing at all,

1:04:52.222 --> 1:04:54.356
I know for certain
that life is not guaranteed

1:04:54.391 --> 1:04:56.458
and that love should never
be taken off the table.

1:05:14.411 --> 1:05:16.211
Mm. Just when I thought there
was no topping this meal.

1:05:16.246 --> 1:05:19.547
Well, I've got my mojo back.

1:05:19.583 --> 1:05:22.017
Hmm.

1:05:22.052 --> 1:05:24.185
I like the sound of that.
One second.

1:05:29.359 --> 1:05:32.594
Please...Put that recipe

1:05:32.663 --> 1:05:33.662
in my book.

1:05:38.101 --> 1:05:39.901
You have a cookbook?

1:05:39.937 --> 1:05:42.604
Not quite.

1:05:42.639 --> 1:05:45.040
My dad made a book
of my recipes

1:05:45.075 --> 1:05:46.675
when I graduated culinary.

1:05:46.710 --> 1:05:48.410
He says every great chef

1:05:48.478 --> 1:05:49.644
has a cookbook, and this is
mine.

1:05:49.680 --> 1:05:51.613
Oh, wow. Oh...

1:05:51.648 --> 1:05:52.847
Is that you?

1:05:54.651 --> 1:05:56.384
There I am.

1:05:56.420 --> 1:05:57.552
(chuckles) so cute!

1:05:57.587 --> 1:06:01.189
Wow. This is a really good idea.

1:06:01.224 --> 1:06:03.124
All my recipes are written
on index cards

1:06:03.160 --> 1:06:06.261
and tucked away
in an old shoebox.

1:06:06.296 --> 1:06:09.164
Hmm. You know, sometimes
I get in a space

1:06:09.232 --> 1:06:11.066
where I start thinking

1:06:11.101 --> 1:06:12.367
things aren't gonna work out
for me,

1:06:12.402 --> 1:06:14.002
I look back at this,

1:06:14.037 --> 1:06:17.305
and I think, ôyou're a chef'.

1:06:17.341 --> 1:06:21.509
And I know everything
is going to be alright.

1:06:21.578 --> 1:06:22.911
I'm gonna go grab a pen.
I'll be back.

1:06:31.221 --> 1:06:34.289
Hey. I'm gonna need
your help with something.

1:07:00.450 --> 1:07:01.049
(cell phone rings)

1:07:09.493 --> 1:07:10.725
I thought you were done
talking to me.

1:07:10.761 --> 1:07:12.694
Where are you?

1:07:12.729 --> 1:07:13.461
Um...

1:07:16.433 --> 1:07:17.766
Nowhere special.

1:07:17.801 --> 1:07:19.968
Your sewing machine came.

1:07:20.037 --> 1:07:20.602
Okay.

1:07:22.539 --> 1:07:25.540
What's wrong?

1:07:25.575 --> 1:07:28.543
The girls and I got into it.

1:07:28.612 --> 1:07:30.645
Melina was talking behind my
back, and allison, well,

1:07:30.680 --> 1:07:33.615
allison was just being allison.

1:07:33.650 --> 1:07:34.949
She said my life was in chaos.

1:07:39.022 --> 1:07:42.057
Well, sometimes your real
friends

1:07:42.125 --> 1:07:44.192
can see what we can't.

1:07:44.261 --> 1:07:45.927
So where are they now?

1:07:45.962 --> 1:07:47.796
I don't know.

1:07:47.864 --> 1:07:49.397
I needed some space.

1:07:49.433 --> 1:07:52.267
I just feel off.

1:07:52.335 --> 1:07:54.335
I don't know.
It's hard to explain.

1:07:54.371 --> 1:07:56.704
Well, you used to be chill,

1:07:56.773 --> 1:07:59.307
and now you're anxious
all the time.

1:07:59.342 --> 1:08:01.276
Because I feel like you don't
wanna do stuff with me.

1:08:01.311 --> 1:08:03.244
Look, I have a job.

1:08:03.280 --> 1:08:05.113
I can't play with you all day.

1:08:05.182 --> 1:08:06.214
And you know, I feel like
you only want me around

1:08:06.249 --> 1:08:08.616
to do your projects.

1:08:08.652 --> 1:08:09.951
And I feel like you don't
want me around at all.

1:08:09.986 --> 1:08:11.619
That's not true.

1:08:11.655 --> 1:08:13.121
It feels like that.

1:08:13.156 --> 1:08:15.490
That's how I feel.

1:08:15.559 --> 1:08:16.057
I mean, I see the way
you look at me and...

1:08:19.529 --> 1:08:21.496
You're frustrated.

1:08:21.531 --> 1:08:23.298
That's because you're
frustrated.

1:08:23.333 --> 1:08:26.000
Andre, I'm in an apartment.

1:08:26.036 --> 1:08:29.537
I mean...I mean
I'm looking at an apartment.

1:08:29.573 --> 1:08:32.040
An apartment? For what?

1:08:32.075 --> 1:08:34.042
I don't know.
I thought I needed time

1:08:34.077 --> 1:08:35.210
to figure this out, but...

1:08:37.614 --> 1:08:39.147
Now it just doesn't feel right.

1:08:42.085 --> 1:08:42.817
Time alone.

1:08:45.789 --> 1:08:47.155
So what are you saying, babe?

1:08:51.995 --> 1:08:55.096
What if I can't get pregnant?

1:08:55.132 --> 1:08:57.232
Will you still want me?

1:08:57.267 --> 1:09:00.502
Yes!
How can you ask me that?

1:09:00.537 --> 1:09:02.737
Because I don't know.

1:09:02.806 --> 1:09:04.873
Look, teresa,
I will always want you.

1:09:04.941 --> 1:09:06.508
I just...

1:09:09.146 --> 1:09:10.478
I just wish you were here.

1:09:23.460 --> 1:09:25.226
Hey.

1:09:25.262 --> 1:09:26.628
-Hi!
-Um...

1:09:26.696 --> 1:09:28.897
Thanks for returning my text.

1:09:28.932 --> 1:09:32.133
-Of course.
-Yeah.

1:09:32.169 --> 1:09:34.302
Listen, I know we need to talk
and...

1:09:34.337 --> 1:09:36.337
You know what, let me start.

1:09:36.373 --> 1:09:37.939
I've been doing
a lot of thinking about

1:09:37.974 --> 1:09:39.908
what you said about me
being scattered.

1:09:39.943 --> 1:09:41.876
-I said unfocused.
-Alright. Unfocused.

1:09:41.912 --> 1:09:43.444
I haven't been
the easiest person to talk to.

1:09:43.513 --> 1:09:45.647
I get it.

1:09:45.682 --> 1:09:47.815
You seem really calm
right now.

1:09:47.851 --> 1:09:49.684
Um, should I be scared?

1:09:49.753 --> 1:09:51.286
No.

1:09:51.321 --> 1:09:53.121
Did you talk to dre?

1:09:53.156 --> 1:09:54.322
-We had a long talk.
-Okay.

1:09:54.391 --> 1:09:57.225
And...

1:09:57.260 --> 1:09:59.093
And I meditated in a field
with a bunch of strangers.

1:09:59.162 --> 1:10:02.830
Oh, well, that's um,
different.

1:10:02.866 --> 1:10:04.632
It's amazing
what you can hear

1:10:04.668 --> 1:10:06.501
when you block out the noise.

1:10:06.570 --> 1:10:08.269
I miss feeling important.

1:10:08.305 --> 1:10:10.371
I haven't been feeling needed,

1:10:10.407 --> 1:10:12.207
and it's been driving me crazy.

1:10:12.242 --> 1:10:13.508
I'm sorry.

1:10:13.543 --> 1:10:16.811
That's okay.

1:10:16.846 --> 1:10:20.014
So, I guess you didn't
sign that lease.

1:10:20.083 --> 1:10:22.917
No. Once I got there,
it just didn't feel right.

1:10:22.953 --> 1:10:26.154
Hmm.

1:10:26.189 --> 1:10:28.056
Well, look,
I'm sure when you go home,

1:10:28.124 --> 1:10:30.225
you and andre can talk,

1:10:30.293 --> 1:10:32.627
and things will work out.

1:10:32.662 --> 1:10:33.561
Well, we have a lot
to talk about,

1:10:33.597 --> 1:10:35.563
but I hope so.

1:10:35.599 --> 1:10:36.965
And you know
you're very important to me,

1:10:37.033 --> 1:10:40.635
so there's that too.

1:10:40.670 --> 1:10:41.369
So what time are you
heading out to the airport?

1:10:43.840 --> 1:10:45.340
About that.

1:10:45.375 --> 1:10:48.076
So I am not going.

1:10:48.111 --> 1:10:50.078
And what made you
change your mind?

1:10:50.113 --> 1:10:51.746
Reesa, I have to let go,
and trust my team.

1:10:54.751 --> 1:10:55.683
And have fun in the kitchen
again.

1:10:55.719 --> 1:10:58.653
Look at you!

1:10:58.688 --> 1:10:59.454
And to think,
you almost didn't come.

1:10:59.489 --> 1:11:01.823
Yeah.

1:11:01.891 --> 1:11:03.258
Allison is going to be really
thrilled to hear this.

1:11:03.293 --> 1:11:03.891
Hey, have you talked to her?

1:11:03.927 --> 1:11:06.361
No.

1:11:06.396 --> 1:11:07.195
Because I've been calling
and texting, and...

1:11:09.499 --> 1:11:10.798
I want to give her this.

1:11:10.834 --> 1:11:11.766
What?

1:11:17.474 --> 1:11:18.706
No--

1:11:18.742 --> 1:11:20.408
yeah.

1:11:20.443 --> 1:11:21.843
(melina laughs)

1:11:21.878 --> 1:11:23.678
okay. Okay! Let's go!

1:11:23.713 --> 1:11:24.078
Check please!

1:11:30.253 --> 1:11:32.120
No sign of her.

1:11:32.188 --> 1:11:32.754
Okay. We gotta call nico.

1:11:35.425 --> 1:11:37.458
Ciao.

1:11:37.494 --> 1:11:39.560
(cell phone rings)

1:11:39.629 --> 1:11:40.995
(speaking italian)

1:11:41.031 --> 1:11:42.297
it's us! Allison's friends.

1:11:42.332 --> 1:11:44.432
Is allison with you?

1:11:44.467 --> 1:11:46.401
No. I've been calling her,
but she hasn't answered.

1:11:46.436 --> 1:11:48.903
-Okay.
-She hasn't called us back
either.

1:11:48.938 --> 1:11:50.738
-She's missing.
-She is not missing.

1:11:50.807 --> 1:11:52.040
-She is missing!
-We just don't know where she
is.

1:11:52.075 --> 1:11:54.442
Do you know where she is?

1:11:54.477 --> 1:11:56.344
She posted something
earlier this morning.

1:11:56.413 --> 1:11:58.279
She could still be there.

1:11:58.315 --> 1:12:02.884
It looks like
canale monterano's church.

1:12:02.919 --> 1:12:04.085
That's that place
she's always talking about.

1:12:04.154 --> 1:12:05.386
Nico, we're gonna go there.

1:12:05.422 --> 1:12:06.354
I'll meet you. Ciao.

1:12:21.104 --> 1:12:22.003
Allison!

1:12:25.508 --> 1:12:27.275
Allison?

1:12:27.310 --> 1:12:29.210
Are you here?

1:12:29.245 --> 1:12:31.913
Oh my gosh. Where--

1:12:31.981 --> 1:12:32.814
allison!?

1:12:34.784 --> 1:12:35.516
Both: Allison!!

1:12:38.755 --> 1:12:40.788
Hey!

1:12:40.824 --> 1:12:42.890
Allison, we have been calling
you.

1:12:42.926 --> 1:12:45.259
You scared us.

1:12:45.328 --> 1:12:46.994
Oh. Sorry.

1:12:47.030 --> 1:12:48.996
Reception up here is spotty.

1:12:49.032 --> 1:12:49.997
Well, are you okay?
We're worried.

1:12:50.033 --> 1:12:51.999
Yeah. I'm fine.

1:12:54.971 --> 1:12:55.570
What's happening?

1:12:58.341 --> 1:12:59.874
I thought you were leaving?

1:12:59.909 --> 1:13:02.844
What? No. I'm staying.

1:13:02.879 --> 1:13:05.580
But we'll get to that.

1:13:05.615 --> 1:13:09.751
Wow. You had us worried.
Listen.

1:13:09.786 --> 1:13:14.155
I'm really sorry, okay,
that I lied about tapas.

1:13:14.190 --> 1:13:16.290
It's just you always have
everything together,

1:13:16.326 --> 1:13:16.657
and I was kind of embarrassed
that I didn't.

1:13:21.264 --> 1:13:23.965
Okay, well, number one.

1:13:24.033 --> 1:13:25.032
I am so glad you are staying.

1:13:29.839 --> 1:13:30.638
Number two,
I don't always have it together.

1:13:30.673 --> 1:13:31.339
Um...

1:13:34.677 --> 1:13:35.877
I froze on the call with the
board.

1:13:35.912 --> 1:13:37.945
Melina: Really?

1:13:38.014 --> 1:13:40.248
Yeah. The more I spoke,

1:13:40.283 --> 1:13:43.317
the more I realized
it isn't what I want.

1:13:43.353 --> 1:13:43.951
(allison sighs heavily)

1:13:49.793 --> 1:13:51.292
I, allison cooper, am guilty
of faking the funk.

1:13:54.898 --> 1:13:56.964
Enjoy this moment, reesa.

1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.200
You were right.

1:13:59.269 --> 1:14:00.435
I'm just saying,
it's a magical place.

1:14:00.470 --> 1:14:01.836
-You know what?
-(melina laughs)

1:14:01.905 --> 1:14:02.170
I knew you were gonna say that.

1:14:04.741 --> 1:14:05.440
I, too, have a confession.

1:14:08.511 --> 1:14:13.648
I just recently learned that
my chakras are not aligned.

1:14:13.683 --> 1:14:15.683
And that's the reason why
I've been so,

1:14:15.752 --> 1:14:16.918
so bossy and scattered.

1:14:19.522 --> 1:14:21.222
And I'm working on it.

1:14:21.257 --> 1:14:22.890
(all laugh)

1:14:22.926 --> 1:14:24.392
it's not funny.

1:14:24.461 --> 1:14:26.394
I need something to do.

1:14:26.463 --> 1:14:28.463
I mean, I retired

1:14:28.498 --> 1:14:29.964
so that I could have a family.

1:14:29.999 --> 1:14:31.165
And if I can't...

1:14:31.234 --> 1:14:32.099
No.

1:14:35.004 --> 1:14:38.506
I know a lot of good fertility
doctors in north carolina.

1:14:38.541 --> 1:14:39.674
And we are going to do
whatever it takes

1:14:39.709 --> 1:14:41.442
for you to have
the family you want.

1:14:41.478 --> 1:14:44.779
Okay.
You are going to be fine.

1:14:44.814 --> 1:14:46.113
That's right. Okay, listen.

1:14:46.149 --> 1:14:48.850
Positive thoughts only.

1:14:48.885 --> 1:14:51.519
Look!

1:14:51.554 --> 1:14:53.287
Miss optimistic is back.

1:14:53.323 --> 1:14:56.257
Hey!

1:14:56.292 --> 1:14:57.091
Maybe somebody got her chakras
aligned last night.

1:14:57.126 --> 1:14:58.726
Maybe!

1:14:58.761 --> 1:15:00.761
(gasping) nothing happened!

1:15:00.797 --> 1:15:02.463
(all laughing)

1:15:02.532 --> 1:15:03.731
-stop it! Stop it!
-Yeah.

1:15:03.766 --> 1:15:05.399
(squeals) I'm just saying!

1:15:05.468 --> 1:15:06.734
I have to get my chakras
aligned!

1:15:06.803 --> 1:15:06.968
We know you would!
(laughing)

1:15:08.104 --> 1:15:11.706
okay. Listen.

1:15:11.741 --> 1:15:14.175
I'm just back
to trusting the universe again.

1:15:14.210 --> 1:15:16.577
That's good.

1:15:16.646 --> 1:15:18.713
No more waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

1:15:18.748 --> 1:15:21.315
-And...No more secrets.
-Yeah.

1:15:21.351 --> 1:15:24.452
And no more judging.

1:15:24.487 --> 1:15:27.455
I'm sorry I haven't been the
most supportive friend.

1:15:27.524 --> 1:15:28.789
Well, you know,
everyone needs that best friend

1:15:28.858 --> 1:15:30.191
that's gonna push them to be
great,

1:15:30.226 --> 1:15:31.959
and that is who you are.

1:15:31.995 --> 1:15:33.227
(allison laughs)

1:15:33.296 --> 1:15:34.996
listen.

1:15:35.031 --> 1:15:37.331
-Now it's our turn. So...
-Right.

1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:40.434
Remember when you said

1:15:40.470 --> 1:15:42.036
if it was meant for you
to be an author,

1:15:42.071 --> 1:15:42.904
you'd already have a book
by now?

1:15:47.377 --> 1:15:49.143
What is this?

1:15:49.178 --> 1:15:50.745
(reesa and melina giggle)

1:15:50.780 --> 1:15:53.748
òunthinkably good thingsó

1:15:53.783 --> 1:15:53.915
by dr. Allison cooper.

1:16:03.693 --> 1:16:04.992
Oh...

1:16:05.028 --> 1:16:07.328
These are my posts.

1:16:07.397 --> 1:16:10.698
Or, as I like to call it,
um...

1:16:10.733 --> 1:16:13.568
Your first poetry book.

1:16:13.636 --> 1:16:17.872
And there are more
blank pages in there

1:16:17.941 --> 1:16:19.173
if you should get inspired
to write some more stuff.

1:16:19.242 --> 1:16:21.576
Thank you, both!

1:16:21.611 --> 1:16:23.744
And I would love
to take some of the credit,

1:16:23.780 --> 1:16:25.379
but this was all melina.

1:16:25.415 --> 1:16:27.081
Oh...

1:16:27.150 --> 1:16:28.349
Look at the last page.

1:16:31.921 --> 1:16:33.120
Òfall in love

1:16:33.156 --> 1:16:33.921
with your fresh start.Ó

1:16:36.025 --> 1:16:38.392
did I post that?

1:16:38.428 --> 1:16:41.162
No, but um, you used to say it
to us all the time.

1:16:41.197 --> 1:16:42.997
Mm-hmm.

1:16:43.032 --> 1:16:43.864
(softly) oh, yeah. I did.

1:16:43.933 --> 1:16:46.133
I can't go, can I?

1:16:46.169 --> 1:16:47.568
-No, you cannot.
-No. Uh-uh.

1:16:47.604 --> 1:16:48.469
Don't you make me cry.

1:16:51.541 --> 1:16:54.475
Am I starting over? Right?
Yeah?

1:16:54.510 --> 1:16:57.144
I'm starting over. Oh!

1:16:57.180 --> 1:16:59.280
Oh, reesa.

1:16:59.315 --> 1:17:02.316
Whew!

1:17:02.385 --> 1:17:05.353
You know, it feels like
we're back

1:17:05.388 --> 1:17:07.588
on that rooftop
of our old building.

1:17:07.657 --> 1:17:09.090
-Oh!
-Oh, yeah.

1:17:09.158 --> 1:17:10.391
And remember?

1:17:10.460 --> 1:17:13.160
But...This.

1:17:13.196 --> 1:17:14.996
This is a much better view.

1:17:15.064 --> 1:17:19.200
(melina sighs)

1:17:19.235 --> 1:17:21.669
I'm taking my freedom.

1:17:21.704 --> 1:17:24.038
Uh-oh.
What you gonna do with it?

1:17:24.073 --> 1:17:27.575
(singing) I'm pulling it
off the shelf. (laughing)

1:17:27.610 --> 1:17:30.911
♪ I'm putting it on my chain.

1:17:30.947 --> 1:17:32.446
♪ I'm wearing it
around my neck. ♪

1:17:32.482 --> 1:17:34.515

1:17:55.171 --> 1:17:58.773
Oh, wait.
Uh, before you go.

1:17:58.808 --> 1:18:01.008
I gotta get those keys
to your car

1:18:01.044 --> 1:18:03.811
ôcause I gotta take back
this fabric.

1:18:03.846 --> 1:18:04.979
Doggy line?
Why did you support that?

1:18:05.014 --> 1:18:05.713
Um...

1:18:07.517 --> 1:18:08.749
Okay.

1:18:08.785 --> 1:18:10.351
Buongiorno.

1:18:10.420 --> 1:18:11.285
Um, unless you need us to stay.

1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:13.454
No, no, no.

1:18:13.489 --> 1:18:14.855
I think she's got it.
And I think you got it.

1:18:14.891 --> 1:18:16.891
Ciao!

1:18:16.926 --> 1:18:18.392
-Arrivederci.
-Bye!

1:18:18.428 --> 1:18:20.861
-Bye bye!
-Come on.

1:18:20.897 --> 1:18:21.028
-Get in the car.
-Bye.

1:18:23.366 --> 1:18:24.398
(allison chuckles)

1:18:24.434 --> 1:18:25.499
ciao alli.

1:18:25.568 --> 1:18:26.701
Allison: Ciao.

1:18:31.240 --> 1:18:33.708
I'm surprised to see you.

1:18:33.743 --> 1:18:35.843
Reesa called me because she
was worried about you and...

1:18:39.549 --> 1:18:40.414
I wanted to see you before I
left.

1:18:42.452 --> 1:18:44.518
Where are you going?

1:18:44.554 --> 1:18:46.654
Sanducci, I leave tonight,

1:18:46.689 --> 1:18:48.789
and I'll be there a few weeks,

1:18:48.825 --> 1:18:50.591
so probably,
when I'll be back you'll--

1:18:50.626 --> 1:18:51.158
can you wait?

1:18:53.429 --> 1:18:54.762
So...

1:18:54.797 --> 1:18:55.796
I can join you?

1:18:58.768 --> 1:18:59.567
After my girl's leave?

1:19:02.772 --> 1:19:05.840
Are you saying you want to
meet the rest of my family?

1:19:05.908 --> 1:19:08.609
-It depends.
-On what?

1:19:08.644 --> 1:19:11.545
Am I still the reason
behind your smile?

1:19:11.581 --> 1:19:12.179
-More than ever.
-(allison laughs)

1:19:12.215 --> 1:19:14.415
so...

1:19:14.484 --> 1:19:17.017
Wait, does this mean
you took the offer here?

1:19:17.053 --> 1:19:20.621
(gasps) oh, the job!

1:19:20.656 --> 1:19:23.691
Dr. Di grado meets with the
board in thirty minutes.

1:19:23.726 --> 1:19:25.059
I have to-I have to go. I
have to get to the school.

1:19:25.094 --> 1:19:26.727
Come on! Come on!
Let's go!

1:19:26.763 --> 1:19:28.829
-Uh...
-Come on!

1:19:28.865 --> 1:19:30.564
Where's your truck?

1:19:30.633 --> 1:19:30.965
Lorenzo's running errands.
Come on.

1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:34.335
Um, I...

1:19:34.403 --> 1:19:36.137
If you want to stay here, we
don't have a lot of time.

1:19:36.205 --> 1:19:37.705
-Come on. Let's go! Let's go!
-(allison screams)

1:19:37.740 --> 1:19:39.440
(inaudible) okay.

1:19:39.509 --> 1:19:42.343
My helmet.

1:19:42.378 --> 1:19:43.811
Oh...

1:19:43.846 --> 1:19:46.480
-Come on, alli.
-Okay.

1:19:46.516 --> 1:19:49.550
Ready. Hug me.

1:19:49.585 --> 1:19:51.919
(allison screams)

1:19:51.954 --> 1:19:55.222
slow down! Slow down!
(nico laughs)

1:19:55.258 --> 1:19:56.824
slow down! Slow down, nico!
Slow down!

1:20:02.765 --> 1:20:03.798
Who is that?

1:20:05.902 --> 1:20:08.068
Andre!!

1:20:08.104 --> 1:20:10.337
Reesa!!

1:20:10.373 --> 1:20:12.807
I can't believe you're here!

1:20:12.842 --> 1:20:13.808
Yeah!

1:20:18.781 --> 1:20:20.681
I'm so happy to see you.

1:20:20.716 --> 1:20:21.415
-I love you.
-I love you too.

1:20:29.725 --> 1:20:30.891
Oh...Excuse me. Oh!

1:20:34.263 --> 1:20:36.330
Oh!

1:20:36.365 --> 1:20:38.532
Dr. Cooper!
This is a surprise.

1:20:38.568 --> 1:20:40.267
I'm sorry to burst in like this,

1:20:40.303 --> 1:20:42.469
but I, uh,
I came to let you know

1:20:42.505 --> 1:20:43.470
that I really want that
position.

1:20:43.506 --> 1:20:45.706
Oh?

1:20:45.741 --> 1:20:47.474
I plan to ignite
my students' creativity

1:20:47.543 --> 1:20:49.009
and help them find
their voices

1:20:49.045 --> 1:20:52.346
because...Proper language

1:20:52.381 --> 1:20:54.448
and the richness
of english literature

1:20:54.483 --> 1:20:56.684
are important, but tapping
into a student's

1:20:56.752 --> 1:20:58.919
individual expression

1:20:58.955 --> 1:21:01.722
is critical
to their personal growth.

1:21:01.757 --> 1:21:02.723
And more than anything,

1:21:02.758 --> 1:21:05.826
I want to stay here,

1:21:05.862 --> 1:21:09.430
because I cannot imagine myself

1:21:09.465 --> 1:21:10.965
anywhere else.

1:21:12.902 --> 1:21:16.403
Well said.

1:21:16.439 --> 1:21:18.973
Does anyone here object
to dr. Cooper

1:21:19.008 --> 1:21:21.275
continuing her position for,

1:21:21.310 --> 1:21:23.377
how long do you anticipate
being here?

1:21:28.918 --> 1:21:31.285
Indefinitely.

1:21:31.354 --> 1:21:34.121
Well. Good. No?

1:21:40.162 --> 1:21:43.364
Okay. (laughs)

1:21:43.399 --> 1:21:46.767
sorry. How are you?
Okay.

1:21:46.802 --> 1:21:48.502
(allison laughs) yay me!

1:21:48.537 --> 1:21:52.006
Oh, okay. Grazie! Grazie!

1:21:52.074 --> 1:21:54.241
Buona sera!

1:21:54.277 --> 1:21:56.644
So?

1:21:56.712 --> 1:21:57.611
(allison giggles)

1:22:00.316 --> 1:22:02.516
your girlfriend is staying.

1:22:02.551 --> 1:22:05.019
Are you?

1:22:05.087 --> 1:22:07.821
Singer:
♪ ohhhhh

1:22:07.890 --> 1:22:10.190
♪ yeah

1:22:10.226 --> 1:22:11.025
I love you.

1:22:16.032 --> 1:22:17.998
Allison: When you're young,

1:22:18.034 --> 1:22:20.601
having girlfriends is simple.

1:22:20.636 --> 1:22:22.803
Understand her language.
Support her bad decisions.

1:22:22.838 --> 1:22:24.738
Love who she loves,

1:22:24.774 --> 1:22:25.572
and dislike who she dislikes.

1:22:28.010 --> 1:22:30.711
As time passes,

1:22:30.780 --> 1:22:34.315
and life gets complicated,

1:22:34.350 --> 1:22:36.717
it's not as easy
to understand her silence,

1:22:36.752 --> 1:22:39.353
embrace her insecurities,

1:22:39.388 --> 1:22:42.890
and agree to disagree.

1:22:42.925 --> 1:22:45.292
But it's a choice
we make as girlfriends,

1:22:45.328 --> 1:22:48.963
and it's sacred.

1:22:48.998 --> 1:22:52.900
I always knew there was strength
in friendship,

1:22:52.935 --> 1:22:55.869
but along this journey,

1:22:55.905 --> 1:22:58.038
I've learned there is pure magic

1:22:58.074 --> 1:23:02.176
in this bond we call sisterhood.

1:23:02.244 --> 1:23:07.548
Singer:
♪ place me now

1:23:07.583 --> 1:23:10.551
♪ on your spirit way,
'cause... ♪
