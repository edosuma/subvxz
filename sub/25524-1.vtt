00:04.720 --> 00:06.040
<i>That Lydia bitch Quigley.</i>

00:06.120 --> 00:07.480
<i>She's trying to keep me down.</i>

00:07.560 --> 00:09.720
<i>That woman is pure menace.</i>

00:09.800 --> 00:11.520
Sometimes...

00:11.600 --> 00:13.200
<i>God just fills your glass.</i>

00:15.440 --> 00:17.000
<i>What's your price</i>
<i>so I may have her?</i>

00:17.120 --> 00:18.440
<i>I'll be taking sealed bids</i>

00:18.480 --> 00:19.840
<i>for Lucy's virginity</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:21.120
as I did for Charlotte,

00:21.240 --> 00:23.600
<i>my older daughter.</i>

00:23.640 --> 00:26.120
<i>...one of the brightest stars</i>
<i>in London's firmament.</i>

00:27.800 --> 00:28.800
Charlotte?

00:28.840 --> 00:30.840
Charlotte, you infernal whore!

00:30.960 --> 00:32.920
‐I want Lucy.
‐Lucy is exceptional.

00:33.040 --> 00:34.920
You may not ever refuse me.

00:35.040 --> 00:36.040
No!

00:39.360 --> 00:41.480
<i>It's my murder now.</i>

00:41.560 --> 00:45.040
<i>The beast requires</i>
<i>feeding again.</i>

00:45.120 --> 00:48.080
<i>The hounds are coming,</i>
<i>vixen.</i>

00:48.120 --> 00:50.560
To catch a beast,
you must have bait.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.360
<i>If I knew</i>
<i>the nature of the beast,</i>

00:52.440 --> 00:54.480
how much better
I could nourish it.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.920
<i>If it is you,</i>

00:58.040 --> 00:59.320
who were they?

01:06.560 --> 01:08.640
<i>My mother was sold age 10.</i>

01:08.720 --> 01:09.840
<i>Lydia Quigley</i>

01:09.920 --> 01:11.280
<i>put her to work as a whore.</i>

01:11.360 --> 01:12.480
Charlotte!

01:12.560 --> 01:15.080
<i>Fate has put me</i>
<i>in her house,</i>

01:15.120 --> 01:16.840
and I will bring her down.

01:41.360 --> 01:42.920
<i>‐Oh!</i>
<i>‐Oh!</i>

01:46.000 --> 01:47.840
‐Which one, which one?
‐How about her?

01:47.920 --> 01:49.440
<i>Angel from the gods</i>

01:49.480 --> 01:51.280
that needs corrupting.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.640
Look at this.

02:02.640 --> 02:03.640
Gentlemen.

02:09.919 --> 02:12.920
And you, beautiful.

02:15.200 --> 02:17.200
These are untamed naiads;

02:17.240 --> 02:19.240
you'll frighten them away.

02:19.360 --> 02:21.360
<i>You must watch them,</i>

02:21.480 --> 02:23.520
<i>like a work of art.</i>

02:23.640 --> 02:26.480
When can we tup
the work of art?

02:26.520 --> 02:28.520
When you pay me
three gold guineas.

02:29.960 --> 02:30.920
Each.

02:43.600 --> 02:44.520
All right.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.200
<i>Our Lord knew that virtue</i>

02:54.320 --> 02:55.800
<i>grew in the desert,</i>

02:55.920 --> 02:57.920
<i>not in palaces of luxury.</i>

02:59.360 --> 03:01.920
<i>There is honor in poverty,</i>

03:01.960 --> 03:03.880
<i>and strength in hunger.</i>

03:03.920 --> 03:07.200
<i>Those who turn their backs</i>
<i>on the sugared coin</i>

03:07.240 --> 03:09.320
<i>will be welcomed</i>
<i>into paradise.</i>

03:09.360 --> 03:11.680
‐Thief!
‐The Lord is always with you.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.360
<i>‐Thief!</i>
<i>‐If you give him your heart.</i>

03:13.400 --> 03:15.320
<i>‐Thief!</i>
<i>‐Do not fall into</i>

03:15.360 --> 03:16.400
<i>the fleshly chasm,</i>

03:16.480 --> 03:18.880
<i>for the brief bliss</i>
<i>that it offers</i>

03:18.920 --> 03:21.240
will incinerate your soul.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.480
‐It matches.
<i>‐Embrace your wretchedness</i>

03:24.520 --> 03:26.360
<i>and be thankful,</i>

03:26.400 --> 03:29.240
<i>for as you chew the dry crust</i>

03:29.360 --> 03:31.600
<i>and thirst for clear water,</i>

03:31.640 --> 03:36.600
<i>know that respite is waiting</i>
<i>in the next world.</i>

03:44.680 --> 03:46.080
Get off me!

03:47.680 --> 03:48.600
Get off me!

03:49.760 --> 03:50.640
Get off me!

03:53.400 --> 03:55.360
‐No!
<i>‐Am I not even allowed</i>

03:55.400 --> 03:57.320
<i>to speak to him?</i>
<i>I live in the same house.</i>

03:57.360 --> 03:59.040
<i>What exactly are you</i>
<i>accusing her of?</i>

03:59.080 --> 04:00.360
Every time I look,
you're flashing

04:00.400 --> 04:01.600
your cow's eyes at my man.

04:01.640 --> 04:02.640
How dare you accuse me,

04:02.760 --> 04:03.640
I've done nothing wrong!

04:03.680 --> 04:05.040
Am I blind?

04:05.080 --> 04:07.040
<i>How can you deny it?</i>

04:07.080 --> 04:08.080
<i>This is the manufacture</i>

04:08.160 --> 04:09.640
of your green‐eyed soul.

04:10.920 --> 04:12.960
<i>I want you out of my house!</i>

04:13.080 --> 04:14.920
<i>I want you to get out.</i>

04:14.960 --> 04:16.720
<i>I'll not stay to be maligned.</i>

04:16.839 --> 04:18.399
You're in love with him.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.279
<i>How can you deny it?</i>

04:20.360 --> 04:23.360
What?

04:23.400 --> 04:26.160
Don't you feign ignorance
with me, William North.

04:26.280 --> 04:28.600
She plays you like
a tinker's fiddle.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.520
This isn't about Harriet!

04:32.160 --> 04:33.720
I won't suffer her
another day.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.720
Margaret!

04:36.840 --> 04:38.160
<i>Maggie, Joseph,</i>
<i>get your things.</i>

04:38.280 --> 04:40.040
‐We have to leave.
‐What have you done?

04:40.080 --> 04:42.080
It's been brewing
like a hurricane.

04:42.160 --> 04:43.720
Now it breaks.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.520
Maggie, Joseph, please!

04:48.600 --> 04:50.400
<i>‐Harriet Lennox!</i>
‐Go, go.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.960
Harriet Lennox,
I want you gone!

04:53.040 --> 04:54.280
Mrs. Wells, please!

04:54.400 --> 04:55.720
<i>Now you keep</i>
<i>your chops out, Fanny,</i>

04:55.840 --> 04:56.960
<i>or you and yours will be next!</i>

04:57.040 --> 04:58.200
If you doubt
your man's affections,

04:58.280 --> 04:59.400
it's not because of me.

04:59.480 --> 05:00.520
Get out of my house,

05:00.600 --> 05:03.520
you haughty,
sneering slut!

05:03.600 --> 05:05.960
Get out of my house!

05:06.040 --> 05:08.600
<i>Go on, get out.</i>

05:08.720 --> 05:10.640
This is a cursed
and god‐forsaken house.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.840
Get out, you spider!

05:11.920 --> 05:13.080
Oh, I'm going‐‐

05:13.160 --> 05:15.840
for fear my daughter
ends up like yours.

05:15.960 --> 05:17.200
<i>Go, come on.</i>

05:18.520 --> 05:19.840
You shame us all.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.480
Kitty,

05:25.520 --> 05:27.400
<i>take the gentleman upstairs.</i>

05:27.520 --> 05:28.960
‐No.
‐What've you done?

05:29.040 --> 05:31.840
<i>‐Harriet!</i>
<i>‐Ah, my own daughter.</i>

05:31.920 --> 05:33.160
Give her a moment of your time

05:33.200 --> 05:35.480
and she'll take you
to circles of heaven.

05:35.520 --> 05:38.040
You'd foist me off
as a substitute for Kitty?

05:41.280 --> 05:42.200
Lucy.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.520
Lucy.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.960
<i>I don't want you to leave.</i>

05:49.040 --> 05:50.400
That woman killed a man

05:50.520 --> 05:54.160
with her bare hands.

05:54.280 --> 05:55.600
You should leave too.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.360
What are you doing?

06:13.160 --> 06:16.080
There is nothing
where there is no trust.

06:16.160 --> 06:18.040
<i>Of course there's trust.</i>

06:18.080 --> 06:20.520
She's been the poison
between us.

06:20.600 --> 06:21.840
The poison between us

06:21.960 --> 06:23.720
is a rich man's corpse.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.160
It lies strangled and rotting

06:25.280 --> 06:27.520
in a marble mausoleum.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.400
You've gone your own way,

06:33.520 --> 06:36.080
Margaret, always.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.400
Now I'll go mine.

06:42.720 --> 06:45.280
Where are you going?

06:45.360 --> 06:46.800
Pa, don't go!

06:46.840 --> 06:48.040
Jacob, go back to your ma.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.400
‐No!
‐Jacob.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.200
He'll soon be back.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.960
He better be
before she throws me out.

07:17.040 --> 07:19.280
I'll be next, me or Mercy.

07:19.360 --> 07:22.160
She said so.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.480
If she tries it,

07:23.520 --> 07:24.720
I'll come with you.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.280
<i>We could set ourselves up.</i>

07:36.360 --> 07:37.480
I've been thinking a while.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.400
You, me, and Harriet.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.600
Two of us working,

07:41.640 --> 07:43.400
one with the children.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.800
You'd be our bawd?

07:45.840 --> 07:47.600
We wouldn't have a bawd;

07:47.640 --> 07:49.480
we'd share.

07:49.520 --> 07:51.800
I want to live
with my daughter.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.840
What about Mrs. Wells?

07:54.960 --> 07:56.920
She uses us, Fan.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.160
I used to pretend
she was my mother.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.480
I know.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.200
Justice Josiah Hunt.

08:20.960 --> 08:23.520
Follow me.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.799
Lydia Quigley?

08:33.919 --> 08:36.000
Charlotte Wells.

08:36.039 --> 08:38.640
W‐what's your position
in the house?

08:41.159 --> 08:42.880
Upright,

08:42.919 --> 08:44.800
side‐saddle,

08:44.880 --> 08:45.920
bare‐back,
recumbent...

08:46.040 --> 08:48.280
What's yours?

08:48.320 --> 08:51.400
<i>I'm more than</i>
<i>delighted to meet you.</i>

08:51.440 --> 08:54.280
‐Congratulations on your rise.
‐Thank you.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.520
I wrote as soon as
I heard of your appointment.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.440
Your predecessor
was a dear friend,

08:58.520 --> 09:02.640
<i>as I hope you will be,</i>
<i>Justice Hunt.</i>

09:02.760 --> 09:06.520
<i>I see you've met my fair</i>
<i>adventuress, Miss Wells.</i>

09:06.640 --> 09:11.320
Forgive me,
I don't squander words.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.680
What might you provide for me?

09:12.800 --> 09:14.920
Here, you will find rest,

09:15.000 --> 09:19.440
respite,
rejuvenation.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.000
A little more
than that, I think?

09:22.040 --> 09:23.040
In my house,

09:23.120 --> 09:24.640
a man's desires are met

09:24.680 --> 09:29.040
with unrestrained
and willing grace.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.320
It's usually
more tranquil here.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.640
May I guess your taste?

09:41.640 --> 09:44.040
You like sincerity,

09:44.120 --> 09:45.760
perhaps a little modesty.

09:45.800 --> 09:47.520
Even‐‐Miss Pettifer.

09:48.920 --> 09:53.680
Or is Miss Wells
a fitting match for you?

09:53.800 --> 09:59.280
I sense a man who likes
an element of risk.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.640
Choose your pleasure.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.760
Lydia Quigley, this is
a warrant for your arrest

10:05.800 --> 10:08.560
as a keeper of a bawdy
and disorderly house.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.560
<i>You're trying to gull me.</i>

10:12.640 --> 10:14.760
I'm no common bawd.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.320
And I'm no common fool.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.000
‐Anne, look to the girls.
<i>‐No, this is a grave mistake.</i>

10:19.040 --> 10:21.520
Find out if any girl
is here against her will.

10:21.560 --> 10:25.520
<i>And I want the name of every</i>
<i>man before you t‐turn him out.</i>

10:25.560 --> 10:27.880
This is‐‐
this is unheard of.

10:30.640 --> 10:31.560
<i>Insupportable.</i>

10:31.640 --> 10:32.760
When it happened to Ma,

10:32.800 --> 10:33.920
it was nothing but a fine.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.400
I'll make sure
the girls are loyal

10:35.520 --> 10:37.040
and you'll soon placate him.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.160
Well, fuck my old boots.

11:21.920 --> 11:24.160
<i>Who put the sour plum</i>
<i>up your arse?</i>

11:26.920 --> 11:28.160
Nance...

11:28.280 --> 11:31.400
Everything you said
is coming true.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.240
You said they'd all leave me,

11:33.280 --> 11:35.040
one by one,

11:35.160 --> 11:38.440
that I'd drive them all away.

11:38.520 --> 11:40.760
Charlotte's gone.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.560
Now Will.

11:42.640 --> 11:43.880
That French bitch has left

11:43.920 --> 11:45.320
owing me 50 pound in debt.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.640
My girls shun me.

11:53.400 --> 11:55.280
That slut Harriet
said my house is cursed.

11:57.040 --> 11:59.800
No one ever did murder
and slept easy.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.400
Violet's been caught thieving.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.920
That new Justice.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.880
He gave Sally McKenzie
a month of clink

12:07.920 --> 12:10.040
for scratching her muff
in the street.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.400
Come on.

12:12.520 --> 12:13.680
You want me to put myself

12:13.800 --> 12:15.400
in sight of a Justice?

12:15.520 --> 12:16.560
Hiding away won't convince him

12:16.640 --> 12:17.400
of your virtue.

12:17.440 --> 12:18.440
The girl needs us.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.240
No.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.400
You're losing
all your friends, are you?

12:29.880 --> 12:32.320
<i>Your mother vexes me sore.</i>

12:32.400 --> 12:36.160
Come home
or she'll just vex me.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.000
I know you didn't fuck Harriet.

12:39.040 --> 12:41.040
You don't wear coarseness well.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.680
I feel for Harriet.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.320
Not in the base way
that your mother thinks,

12:48.400 --> 12:51.000
but her and her children.

12:52.760 --> 12:57.400
They make me feel
how precious is our freedom.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.440
No one's free, Pa.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.160
Hm, who's got you in chains?

13:05.520 --> 13:06.760
You're free as the wind.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.160
Tell your mother
to send my things.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.800
I'm stopping here.

13:21.640 --> 13:23.040
Mrs. Wells,

13:23.160 --> 13:25.000
what news of Miss Charlotte?

13:25.040 --> 13:27.800
<i>She and her Irish knave kept me</i>
<i>in print for days.</i>

13:27.920 --> 13:29.280
Did she murder
Sir George Howard?

13:29.400 --> 13:31.920
Go fuck a flogging post,
Mr. Holland.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.160
<i>You stand accused</i>
<i>of common theft;</i>

13:34.280 --> 13:36.880
<i>that during an act of carnality</i>
<i>with James Buckley,</i>

13:36.920 --> 13:38.760
<i>you did steal a cloth purse</i>

13:38.800 --> 13:40.760
<i>containing five shillings</i>
<i>and threepence.</i>

13:40.800 --> 13:41.760
<i>How do you plead?</i>

13:41.800 --> 13:43.400
The man is thick with gin.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.040
<i>He gave me the purse.</i>

13:46.520 --> 13:48.400
I can vouch for her, sir.

13:48.440 --> 13:49.880
I know her character!

13:49.920 --> 13:52.040
<i>Liar, harlot, thief;</i>

13:52.160 --> 13:53.520
her character is plain.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.000
<i>The witness against this girl</i>

13:55.040 --> 13:56.440
is a notorious drunk.

13:56.520 --> 13:57.800
<i>I'll empty this court</i>

13:57.920 --> 13:59.920
<i>if I hear one word more.</i>

14:00.000 --> 14:01.640
<i>Violet Cross,</i>
<i>I sentence you</i>

14:01.680 --> 14:03.280
<i>to be branded</i>
<i>on the thumb a thief</i>

14:03.400 --> 14:05.920
<i>and t‐transported to America</i>

14:06.000 --> 14:09.760
<i>for a term of‐‐for a term</i>
<i>of seven years servitude.</i>

14:09.800 --> 14:11.400
‐No, no.
<i>‐Seven years?</i>

14:11.520 --> 14:12.800
<i>For a five shilling purse?</i>

14:12.920 --> 14:14.640
Fine, give her a fine!

14:18.440 --> 14:21.800
<i>The court calls Lydia Quigley!</i>

14:21.920 --> 14:24.880
What in the name of Saint Cock?

14:33.400 --> 14:34.920
<i>Lydia Quigley,</i>

14:35.000 --> 14:37.760
<i>it has been witnessed</i>
<i>that you do incite,</i>

14:37.800 --> 14:40.280
procure, counsel,
and command young women

14:40.320 --> 14:43.160
<i>to acts of prostitution</i>

14:43.240 --> 14:46.520
<i>and that you keep a bawdy</i>
<i>and disorderly house.</i>

14:46.640 --> 14:48.280
How do you plead?

14:48.400 --> 14:49.800
I'm amazed to death.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.920
<i>I'm not capable of</i>
<i>such appalling things.</i>

14:55.000 --> 14:57.560
I have seen for myself.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.760
I fine you according
to your means.

14:59.800 --> 15:02.320
‐A fine is not enough!
<i>‐Silence!</i>

15:02.400 --> 15:04.640
<i>This is a vile kidnapper.</i>

15:04.760 --> 15:06.640
She feeds the markets of rape!

15:06.680 --> 15:07.920
<i>Rape, yeah, that's right!</i>

15:09.920 --> 15:11.680
<i>Who makes this accusation?</i>

15:13.240 --> 15:14.640
<i>Margaret Wells of Greek Street.</i>

15:14.760 --> 15:17.160
<i>D‐do you wish to make</i>

15:17.280 --> 15:19.000
<i>a formal accusation?</i>

15:19.040 --> 15:21.160
If so, bring me
witnesses and evidence.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.160
<i>Otherwise you speak slander.</i>

15:24.920 --> 15:26.320
Lydia Quigley,

15:26.400 --> 15:30.640
I fine you for k‐keeping
a disorderly house.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.160
<i>Five hundred pounds to be paid</i>
<i>in coin forthwith,</i>

15:34.280 --> 15:36.800
or by time in the house
of correction.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.280
<i>God is good!</i>

15:38.400 --> 15:40.400
Order, order!

15:40.520 --> 15:41.920
Can you pay, Mrs. Quigley?

15:42.040 --> 15:44.040
<i>No, I need time.</i>

15:44.160 --> 15:45.800
<i>You shall have it.</i>

15:45.920 --> 15:48.320
In the house of correction.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.040
God is just!

15:54.920 --> 15:56.520
<i>Take your hands off of me.</i>

16:01.000 --> 16:03.040
Emily Lacey could
get her on the gallows.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.280
Go straight to her,

16:04.320 --> 16:05.680
before Quigley pays her fine.

16:07.640 --> 16:10.040
Nance...

16:10.160 --> 16:11.120
Is she falling?

16:12.520 --> 16:14.800
I never thought I'd see it.

16:14.880 --> 16:17.040
One hard push
and she's in the fiery pit.

16:22.920 --> 16:25.520
Here's your story:

16:25.560 --> 16:28.000
Dame Death faces doom.

16:28.040 --> 16:31.040
Justice has
a new d‐d‐direction.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.400
Someone else must have

16:33.440 --> 16:35.240
knowledge of her crimes.

16:35.280 --> 16:37.120
They may come forward.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.520
Waste no time.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.280
‐What are we supposed to do?
‐I've got...

16:45.320 --> 16:47.120
<i>Shall I lock them</i>
<i>in their rooms?</i>

16:47.160 --> 16:49.040
No, take them out.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.520
That isn't safe.

16:50.560 --> 16:51.800
We have to show the world

16:51.920 --> 16:53.400
this house remains undaunted.

16:53.440 --> 16:54.680
Then you take them out.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.000
Gladly,

16:56.040 --> 16:58.320
if you go to the jail house.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.160
Then do as I propose.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.560
<i>Lydia Quigley in jail!</i>

17:03.640 --> 17:06.440
Well, sing my soul.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.000
May she be bitten
by a plaguey rat.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.000
She kidnapped you.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.520
She would've had you slain.

17:13.560 --> 17:16.839
It's time to tell the Justice
what you know.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.880
I can't do that.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.760
Has her money made you soft?

17:23.800 --> 17:25.480
I'll speak,

17:25.520 --> 17:26.720
she'll slither out of jail,

17:26.800 --> 17:28.040
and then she'll come for me...

17:28.079 --> 17:30.520
This Justice is a ramrod;

17:30.560 --> 17:31.880
straight as a gunshot.

17:35.720 --> 17:38.280
No.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.280
Don't say no
to little Charlie...

17:40.320 --> 17:41.800
Up!

17:41.880 --> 17:45.040
Your ma's in the clink
for being a dirty bawd.

17:45.120 --> 17:48.560
<i>The Justice slapped her</i>
<i>with a 500 pound fine.</i>

17:48.680 --> 17:52.560
<i>I'd say that roasts</i>
<i>your golden goose.</i>

17:52.680 --> 17:53.760
<i>Nance...</i>

17:57.800 --> 18:01.080
Don't let fear hold you back.

18:01.200 --> 18:03.240
She can't come for you
from the gibbet.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.440
I don't wish my mother dead.

18:14.520 --> 18:15.720
But she should be in jail

18:15.800 --> 18:17.520
after what she did to you.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.520
<i>Let's not cross swords</i>
<i>with her, Charlie.</i>

18:22.040 --> 18:23.480
We've everything we need.

18:23.520 --> 18:26.960
<i>Golden Square</i>
<i>is my inheritance.</i>

18:27.040 --> 18:28.840
We could have so much more.

18:38.960 --> 18:40.520
Mrs. Scanwell!

18:40.560 --> 18:42.720
Mrs. Wells.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.760
A fine day for justice.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.440
How can you say so?

18:46.520 --> 18:47.840
My daughter is distressed

18:47.960 --> 18:51.320
at the fate of a harlot
she is trying to save.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.040
Miss Scanwell, a word?

19:03.720 --> 19:05.600
<i>Let me give you this.</i>

19:05.720 --> 19:07.040
The last time
you offered me help,

19:07.120 --> 19:08.320
I nearly died.

19:12.320 --> 19:13.760
We both know Quigley connects

19:13.800 --> 19:16.360
to Justice Cunliffe's death.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.080
<i>She didn't hold the knife</i>

19:18.200 --> 19:19.800
<i>but it was done on her order,</i>

19:19.880 --> 19:22.520
I am sure.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.120
Speak out.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.120
Say what you know.

19:26.240 --> 19:27.440
They'll believe you.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.520
I must save a soul today,

19:29.600 --> 19:30.800
not damn one.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.480
Think about how
she abused your mother.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.720
No.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.000
<i>Please, I beg you,</i>
<i>please, please.</i>

19:51.040 --> 19:52.520
Please, please, please.

19:52.600 --> 19:53.880
No, no, please no, please‐‐

20:28.960 --> 20:30.520
My mother
doesn't deserve all this.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.040
It should be mine.

20:39.520 --> 20:41.280
So the vultures are gathering.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.480
He's here to chuck the cuckoo

20:42.520 --> 20:43.520
out of his nest.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.000
I'm on my way to the Magistrate

20:45.040 --> 20:46.720
to defend your ma.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.280
Will you come?

20:48.360 --> 20:51.200
My mother's
brought her fate upon herself

20:51.280 --> 20:53.720
and I've no choice
but to take the reins.

20:53.800 --> 20:54.960
Where are the girls?

20:55.040 --> 20:58.040
Out, on my orders.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.760
I don't know
what you're doing here,

20:59.800 --> 21:01.720
but I want you gone.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.800
What natural authority.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.800
Your mother will be
most impressed.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.600
Justice, a word I beg you!

21:12.720 --> 21:13.680
<i>We heartily approve</i>

21:13.760 --> 21:14.800
of your actions today.

21:14.880 --> 21:16.200
All but one.

21:16.280 --> 21:17.520
We pray you might have mercy

21:17.600 --> 21:19.520
on the girl named Violet Cross.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.320
She's known no other life
than vice,

21:21.440 --> 21:24.520
but I've seen goodness
in her heart.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.800
Goodness and love.

21:26.880 --> 21:28.280
The bronze?

21:28.320 --> 21:29.760
She is worth saving, sir.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.280
Then take c‐comfort.

21:32.320 --> 21:33.800
It's through punishment
that the felon

21:33.840 --> 21:35.280
finds redemption
and God's love.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.200
<i>My daughter</i>
<i>taught me the lesson</i>

21:37.280 --> 21:38.680
of forgiveness.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.680
This girl's remorse
may transform her

21:42.760 --> 21:44.360
as powerfully as punishment.

21:44.480 --> 21:45.600
Please,

21:45.720 --> 21:47.680
please have pity.

21:47.760 --> 21:49.600
Show her grace.

21:49.720 --> 21:51.200
Do not make her a slave.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.320
I'll assess her for myself.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.040
Thank you, sir.

21:57.120 --> 22:00.080
I thank you
and I will pray for you.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.800
Emily Lacey won't speak.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.080
The Scanwell girl neither.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.560
Quigley's messenger‐boy,
Rasselas.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.960
He must have some filth on her.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.720
So must your Charlotte.

22:13.800 --> 22:16.680
Charlotte sent me away,

22:16.760 --> 22:18.440
her own mother,

22:18.520 --> 22:20.480
like I was rag and bone.

22:22.280 --> 22:24.280
I'd not go to her
for a golden lump.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.440
Last Sunday,

22:29.520 --> 22:32.240
the body of a girl was found
near Bedford Street.

22:32.280 --> 22:36.520
She had been violated
and most foully slain.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.360
She was last seen
at the employment exchange,

22:38.480 --> 22:42.560
a place you're known
to f‐frequent.

22:42.680 --> 22:44.040
Like many householders,

22:44.080 --> 22:45.880
I go there seeking staff.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.720
You can interview
the maid I hired.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.520
Torment was done
unto that girl.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.840
And to the girl
you've just branded

22:51.960 --> 22:52.840
with a hot iron!

22:52.960 --> 22:55.440
Can you not smell
her burning flesh?

22:55.520 --> 22:58.040
Who f‐frequents your house?

23:00.800 --> 23:03.760
Your superiors.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.360
Men of land and parliament,

23:06.480 --> 23:09.440
men who honored you
with your position.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.760
You could have
walked among them.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.520
As my predecessor did?

23:17.600 --> 23:20.000
I'll leave you time
to dwell upon his fate.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.080
<i>Obscure and lowly as I am,</i>

23:24.200 --> 23:26.560
I'm entrusted with the law.

23:26.680 --> 23:28.880
The duty is immense.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.800
I hold the scales
of life and death.

23:30.880 --> 23:33.280
Why are you barring
my visitors?

23:35.080 --> 23:36.520
No visitors have come.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.080
What do you want?

23:51.520 --> 23:54.240
I want my Charlotte.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.680
How about please?

23:56.760 --> 23:58.360
How about "Sorry
for what I did to you"?

23:58.480 --> 24:00.280
How about you fuck off

24:00.360 --> 24:01.280
back to Greek Street?

24:05.560 --> 24:08.520
I know Nancy's been to see you.

24:08.560 --> 24:09.880
You must think on
what she's said.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.680
Your Charlotte ain't here.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.800
She's gone to help her new ma
out of jail!

24:17.360 --> 24:19.520
Why don't you think on that?

24:19.560 --> 24:20.880
Shut her out, Grunt.

24:28.280 --> 24:29.280
Lucy?

24:34.200 --> 24:35.440
I'm her creature every minute

24:35.520 --> 24:37.000
of the clock,

24:37.040 --> 24:38.880
guessing her bidding,
working my wits

24:39.000 --> 24:41.280
like a vile,
unscrupled whore.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.800
She must dote on you.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.600
I edge towards her secrets.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.840
One day
she'll let down her guard.

24:50.960 --> 24:51.840
When I'm done,

24:51.960 --> 24:55.040
Mrs. Quigley
will be dust and ash.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.800
But she's in jail.
You can leave.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.240
She'll never stay in jail;

24:59.280 --> 25:01.720
you know how it'll go.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.000
I'll not leave.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.040
Not now.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.800
What compels you, Charlotte?

25:08.840 --> 25:11.080
The world is so misshapen.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.360
Must make a corner of it right.

25:13.480 --> 25:14.720
What of you?

25:18.360 --> 25:20.040
Ma thinks you've betrayed her.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.280
<i>Will you talk to her?</i>

25:23.360 --> 25:25.960
And say what?

25:26.040 --> 25:28.360
Then talk to Pa.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.480
He won't come home.

25:30.520 --> 25:33.600
Poor man suffers her
like scrofula.

25:33.720 --> 25:35.320
You should leave too.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.760
You're all grown up, sprat.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.560
We both face ruin.

25:44.680 --> 25:46.280
Only one of us deserves it.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.480
I have nothing
in common with you.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.040
You're right.

25:52.120 --> 25:55.240
For I had friends in court
who spoke for me.

25:55.280 --> 25:58.120
<i>You were jeered at.</i>

25:58.240 --> 26:01.000
<i>Margaret Wells</i>
<i>will hound you to the noose,</i>

26:01.040 --> 26:03.480
and Mary Cooper will
lead you down to hell.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.240
<i>You.</i>

26:05.280 --> 26:06.520
You.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.200
I'll part with this
if you'll take a note

26:08.280 --> 26:10.320
to my man in Golden Square.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.280
That'll do to take the note.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.040
But the ink and paper
will cost you more.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.840
What's your price?

26:28.960 --> 26:30.480
My cudgel wants a tickle.

26:37.440 --> 26:40.040
There's five shillings for you.

26:40.120 --> 26:43.280
Your ladylike hand on my cudgel.

26:58.680 --> 27:00.280
Ink and paper,

27:00.320 --> 27:01.880
damn you to the skies!

27:08.800 --> 27:09.800
Yeah...

27:16.520 --> 27:17.800
Come out with me.

27:17.880 --> 27:19.440
Where to?

27:19.520 --> 27:20.880
Wherever it's bright.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.320
Find some rich culls
and keep what we make.

27:23.440 --> 27:24.800
Are you mad?

27:24.840 --> 27:26.040
Can't stick another night

27:26.120 --> 27:28.520
on my back in this house.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.000
What about your mother?

27:30.040 --> 27:31.520
Fuck my mother.

27:31.560 --> 27:33.720
Are you coming?

27:43.800 --> 27:45.800
Just one more thing,

27:45.880 --> 27:48.280
my dearest love...

27:48.320 --> 27:49.800
My wife would like your wig.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.880
Charlie?

27:59.000 --> 27:59.880
<i>Charlie!</i>

28:03.280 --> 28:04.440
What are you doing?

28:06.800 --> 28:08.240
If I'm going to press a claim

28:08.280 --> 28:09.480
to all of her property,

28:09.520 --> 28:12.080
I need to know
the state of her affairs.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.320
Where are you going?

28:39.440 --> 28:40.960
Out.

28:41.040 --> 28:42.360
No, you're not.

28:42.480 --> 28:45.040
<i>Kept my eye</i>
<i>off business all day</i>

28:45.080 --> 28:48.280
and now there's culls
to be seen.

28:48.320 --> 28:50.120
Instead of telling me
what to do,

28:50.240 --> 28:52.960
why don't you go and find Pa?

28:53.040 --> 28:54.520
He'll be back

28:54.600 --> 28:55.600
when he's ready.

28:55.720 --> 28:56.760
No.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.040
He won't.

28:59.120 --> 29:00.680
He wants you
to send his things.

29:04.080 --> 29:06.560
You can't go out.

29:06.680 --> 29:08.760
It's not safe.

29:08.800 --> 29:12.280
I can look after myself, Ma.

29:12.360 --> 29:14.000
<i>As I've proven.</i>

29:15.520 --> 29:17.080
Lucy, wait,
I'll come with you.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.840
No, you will not.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.880
<i>I cherish you, Kitty,</i>
<i>you know that.</i>

29:23.000 --> 29:25.520
But I will not have mutiny
in my house.

29:25.560 --> 29:26.840
So don't try it.

30:07.960 --> 30:09.520
Out.

30:09.600 --> 30:10.720
Gentlemen, please.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.440
From the High Priestess,

30:21.520 --> 30:23.000
Lydia Quigley.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.680
"I am in fetters for 500 pounds,

30:29.760 --> 30:32.280
and the Wells bitch
is baying.

30:32.360 --> 30:33.600
The High Priestess."

30:35.680 --> 30:36.960
What does it mean?

30:37.040 --> 30:40.440
The Priestess has my name,

30:40.520 --> 30:44.760
and thinks I'll pay
her damnable fine.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.720
Let her rot.

30:47.800 --> 30:50.520
<i>What does</i>
<i>the Wells bitch know?</i>

30:50.600 --> 30:52.600
Nothing.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.040
She was there
when you dispatched

30:54.120 --> 30:56.680
Justice Cunliffe.

30:56.760 --> 30:58.080
We should tell the Archons.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.800
I assure you
there's no danger.

31:00.840 --> 31:04.200
We must simply muzzle
the baying bitch.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.120
I propose some sport

31:06.240 --> 31:07.800
in cutting out her tongue.

31:27.200 --> 31:29.040
<i>‐You came.</i>
‐Of course.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.280
You did as much for me.

31:30.360 --> 31:31.560
Private, if you please.

31:31.680 --> 31:33.080
Charlotte Wells...

31:33.200 --> 31:34.360
Curse you to a prison ship

31:34.480 --> 31:36.120
and seven years hard labor.

31:48.480 --> 31:50.520
The fine is immense.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.040
Tell me where
you stow your funds.

31:52.080 --> 31:54.280
Will you tell my son
I'm here?

31:54.320 --> 31:55.840
He knows.

31:55.960 --> 31:59.480
Charles is at yours
with Emily Lacey,

31:59.520 --> 32:00.840
on what mission I know not.

32:00.960 --> 32:02.080
He and his doxy

32:02.200 --> 32:03.800
have emptied my pockets.

32:03.840 --> 32:07.240
I cannot pay the fine.

32:07.280 --> 32:09.520
You must have
benefactors somewhere.

32:09.560 --> 32:10.680
No, as you can see,

32:10.760 --> 32:12.280
I'm surrounded by kind friends,

32:12.360 --> 32:15.040
all clamoring to help me.

32:15.120 --> 32:18.280
Is this self‐pity?

32:18.360 --> 32:19.560
It's a fine you face,

32:19.680 --> 32:21.120
not the noose.

32:21.240 --> 32:25.520
Stop stewing
and tell me what to do.

32:25.560 --> 32:30.080
A woman's power
is in her secrets.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.520
I've collected them
like jewels

32:32.560 --> 32:34.480
and now they'll keep me safe.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.360
Lady Fitz.

32:43.480 --> 32:44.800
Isabella Fitzwilliam,

32:44.840 --> 32:47.880
heiress of Blayne.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.600
The finest jewel of all.

32:51.320 --> 32:52.800
Do you bleed her,

32:52.840 --> 32:55.720
like a surgeon?

32:55.800 --> 32:58.440
I could ruin her
with one sentence.

33:04.240 --> 33:06.680
Mrs. Wells.

33:06.760 --> 33:08.680
Did you mean what you said,

33:08.760 --> 33:10.480
that you'd throw me and mine
out next?

33:11.360 --> 33:13.880
I'm not a monster.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.720
You're my special girl,

33:15.800 --> 33:17.840
you know that.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.880
You can keep your baby,

33:20.000 --> 33:21.760
till she's weaned.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.240
Now ready yourself
for a cull.

33:29.960 --> 33:32.520
No need to hide your face,
sir.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.680
Pursue Mrs. Quigley

33:34.760 --> 33:36.800
at your peril.

33:36.840 --> 33:39.000
Would that she‐wolf bite me,

33:39.040 --> 33:41.720
even from her cell?

33:41.800 --> 33:45.320
Consider this fair warning.

33:50.320 --> 33:53.000
I was afraid of her
when I was ten years old.

33:54.360 --> 33:55.960
Not now.

33:56.040 --> 33:59.040
Now I'll shout it to the sky:

33:59.080 --> 34:02.280
Lydia Quigley's
a kidnapping bitch.

34:02.360 --> 34:05.440
Did she tell you to slice
Justice Cunliffe?

34:05.520 --> 34:07.280
Do you do all her murders
for her?

34:29.320 --> 34:31.080
Miss Charlotte Wells,

34:31.159 --> 34:32.800
to see the lady of the house.

34:54.120 --> 34:56.280
Miss Charlotte Wells.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.600
The notorious C. W...

35:07.680 --> 35:09.640
Have we not all followed
your exploits

35:09.720 --> 35:12.240
in the grub street press?

35:12.280 --> 35:13.440
<i>A string of keepers,</i>

35:13.560 --> 35:15.560
<i>their fortunes squandered,</i>

35:15.640 --> 35:18.800
a lover murdered in the park?

35:18.840 --> 35:21.560
Who insults me by inviting
this brazen strumpet

35:21.640 --> 35:23.960
<i>into my home?</i>

35:24.080 --> 35:25.800
<i>Is this your mischief?</i>

35:25.880 --> 35:27.600
Mm...

35:27.680 --> 35:29.960
For once,
I cannot claim it.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.160
Come.

35:32.600 --> 35:36.240
Let me see the beauty
that sent George Howard

35:36.280 --> 35:37.800
<i>to an early grave.</i>

35:37.880 --> 35:40.400
Your business
may be slander, Sir,

35:40.480 --> 35:42.640
but mine is with the lady.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.080
Well, I'll hear it.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.800
Miss Wells and I
will take a turn.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.880
What do you want?

36:08.400 --> 36:10.080
My current benefactor,

36:10.160 --> 36:11.320
Mrs. Quigley,

36:11.400 --> 36:12.880
sends me
in her hour of need.

36:12.960 --> 36:15.280
So that is it;
how dare you come?

36:16.920 --> 36:18.680
Her situation
is quite desperate.

36:18.760 --> 36:21.480
I've read about it
in the evening rag.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.840
A stench of crime and kidnap.

36:26.320 --> 36:29.840
How much does she want?

36:29.920 --> 36:32.600
Five hundred pounds, tomorrow.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.840
My brother holds my purse;

36:35.920 --> 36:37.600
I cannot get it.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.320
She's pressed me
to threaten you.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.400
Why?

36:44.480 --> 36:46.160
Does she hold your secret too?

36:49.720 --> 36:51.800
Forgive me.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.160
Perhaps we courtiers

36:54.240 --> 36:57.400
are not unlike
you courtesans.

36:57.480 --> 36:58.880
Our lives, like yours,

36:58.960 --> 37:02.000
are a constant game of sham.

37:02.120 --> 37:06.160
Do you ever long to break
from that pretense?

37:06.240 --> 37:09.080
If I broke free
and spoke my heart,

37:09.160 --> 37:10.320
the sea would bubble,

37:10.400 --> 37:11.600
the sky would turn red,

37:11.680 --> 37:13.760
and London would
tumble into dust.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.000
I should like to witness that.

37:18.120 --> 37:20.760
Izzy?

37:20.800 --> 37:23.080
Say nothing.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.800
Come to me at breakfast.

37:33.840 --> 37:35.360
Gentlemen, come on in.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.960
Make yourselves comfortable.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.200
Take a seat.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.240
Relax.

37:40.280 --> 37:43.200
Anne Pettifer,

37:43.280 --> 37:45.440
<i>how dare you take</i>
<i>these girls out!</i>

37:46.440 --> 37:48.240
Emily...

37:48.280 --> 37:51.440
<i>My pretty little doves!</i>

37:51.560 --> 37:52.760
Have you missed me?

37:52.800 --> 37:54.320
<i>Mrs. Quigley's not back?</i>

37:54.400 --> 37:56.560
No, but here's
her finest port.

37:56.640 --> 37:58.000
We can't,
she'll find out.

37:58.120 --> 37:59.640
Oh, come on, Anne,

37:59.720 --> 38:01.160
you know you want some.

38:01.240 --> 38:03.800
While the cat's away, girls!

38:15.840 --> 38:18.360
Persephone,

38:18.440 --> 38:20.800
where have you been
these past weeks?

38:20.880 --> 38:22.280
I've been pining.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.880
Let me have you.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.240
No.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.760
Come now.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.920
I wrote to your mother
offering excellent terms

38:34.000 --> 38:36.960
to be your keeper.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.240
I burnt it.

38:40.360 --> 38:44.120
I don't like eating seeds
or weird fruit.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.600
I won't be your mistress.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.360
Your hands are cold,

38:51.440 --> 38:53.240
like those of a corpse,

38:53.280 --> 38:55.080
and I only fuck the living.

39:03.440 --> 39:06.360
The Wells bitch
won't be silenced.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.120
She's shouting
kidnap and murder

39:08.200 --> 39:10.800
in the street.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.880
That's the youngest daughter,

39:12.960 --> 39:14.120
there.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.800
A peach.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.880
Shall we pluck her
from the family tree?

39:20.960 --> 39:23.280
No.

39:23.360 --> 39:24.840
I want her to savor.

39:53.840 --> 39:56.560
♪ And then she kicked him
in the head

39:56.640 --> 39:59.800
the clean and country way ♪

39:59.840 --> 40:01.480
To Violet Cross!

40:41.720 --> 40:43.280
Watch how you go, sister.

40:43.360 --> 40:45.280
He's been drinking
since this morning.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.000
Is this your wife?

40:47.120 --> 40:48.800
I have no wife.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.480
<i>She's up at the Wells House.</i>

40:50.600 --> 40:53.960
<i>You can't afford her,</i>
<i>soldier boy.</i>

40:54.080 --> 40:55.600
‐I'm sorry.
<i>‐No need.</i>

40:55.680 --> 40:57.080
<i>You've done nothing wrong.</i>

40:57.160 --> 40:58.120
I have.

40:58.200 --> 41:01.640
I tried to hide the way I feel.

41:01.720 --> 41:03.160
<i>You're a ram, granddad.</i>

41:03.240 --> 41:04.280
<i>Say not a word</i>

41:04.360 --> 41:06.160
<i>or you'll feel my hand.</i>

41:06.240 --> 41:07.840
I'd rather feel her hand...

41:07.920 --> 41:09.480
So you'd defend her honor?

41:09.600 --> 41:10.840
<i>You should take him home,</i>

41:10.920 --> 41:13.280
Mrs. Wells, he's sotted.

41:13.320 --> 41:15.200
You stay away from my house.

41:15.280 --> 41:16.840
Your house?

41:16.920 --> 41:19.240
What, as if I had no part
in your success?

41:19.280 --> 41:20.760
If my skin were of your color,

41:20.800 --> 41:22.480
you'd never dare speak so.

41:22.600 --> 41:24.640
Bollocks.

41:24.720 --> 41:26.240
Go fetch my linen.

41:26.280 --> 41:28.400
I'm staying here.

41:28.480 --> 41:29.720
<i>That's it, you tell her!</i>

41:31.080 --> 41:33.200
That's how you treat a wife,
grandpa.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.000
You're speaking
against Mrs. Quigley?

41:53.080 --> 41:55.800
I can help you.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.680
I saw.

41:57.760 --> 41:59.360
That night.

41:59.440 --> 42:01.240
He was white‐wigged,
he was wealthy dressed.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.400
Who?

42:02.480 --> 42:04.080
The man that stabbed

42:04.160 --> 42:05.640
Justice Cunliffe.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.320
You saw?

42:07.400 --> 42:09.200
I can't tell you who he was.

42:09.280 --> 42:11.360
But if I saw his face again,

42:11.440 --> 42:13.800
I'd know.

42:13.880 --> 42:17.200
And would you
tell this to the law?

42:17.280 --> 42:18.360
He's one of the Lords

42:18.440 --> 42:20.800
who murders for the thrill,

42:20.880 --> 42:23.160
and Quigley's their procuress,
I'm sure.

42:25.120 --> 42:26.680
I'll take this bit of flotsam

42:26.760 --> 42:28.680
to Greek Street.

42:28.760 --> 42:30.360
Too much gin, Cherry?

42:30.440 --> 42:31.840
It doesn't take a lot.

42:31.920 --> 42:33.080
Come on.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.640
Am I your grandpa now, am I?

42:51.720 --> 42:52.760
Am I?

42:52.800 --> 42:53.920
Huh?

43:00.160 --> 43:01.120
Charlotte.

43:03.200 --> 43:04.200
Pa!

43:14.400 --> 43:16.360
Did your ma send you?

43:16.440 --> 43:18.400
Lucy did.

43:18.480 --> 43:19.800
You were looking great, Pa.

43:21.800 --> 43:24.200
I'll bleed all over
your beautiful dress.

43:24.280 --> 43:25.480
I don't care.

43:36.840 --> 43:37.800
Ooh, me, me!

43:54.680 --> 43:56.240
Is Mrs. Wells at home?

43:56.280 --> 43:58.760
Lord Fallon.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.400
I'm here to see her daughter.

44:00.480 --> 44:02.000
They're both out.

44:02.120 --> 44:03.280
Oh...

44:03.320 --> 44:04.560
<i>Pity.</i>

44:04.640 --> 44:05.920
<i>I'd hoped to take Miss Wells</i>

44:06.000 --> 44:09.240
<i>dancing at Ranelagh.</i>

44:09.280 --> 44:11.800
But...

44:11.840 --> 44:14.560
you're just as lovely.

44:14.640 --> 44:18.200
Perhaps I could entice you
in her stead.

44:18.280 --> 44:19.320
Me?

44:21.560 --> 44:23.360
My carriage

44:23.440 --> 44:25.880
and my coinage await.

44:48.360 --> 44:50.280
I'll do it.

44:50.360 --> 44:51.600
I will speak.

44:54.280 --> 44:56.000
<i>Come through.</i>

44:56.120 --> 44:57.840
Oh, ignore him.

44:57.920 --> 45:00.240
He's a filthy little turd.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.360
Ow...

45:13.880 --> 45:15.800
Quigley said to me,

45:15.840 --> 45:19.000
"The hounds are coming, vixen."

45:19.120 --> 45:20.920
There's a pack of them,

45:21.000 --> 45:24.560
and Cunliffe was their man.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.560
I'll speak,
but no one can know

45:26.640 --> 45:27.560
it came from me.

45:27.640 --> 45:28.960
That's fair.

45:29.080 --> 45:31.440
They'd kill you like a fly.

45:31.560 --> 45:34.840
We'll see the Justice private.

45:34.920 --> 45:36.280
I don't want Charles to know

45:36.360 --> 45:39.320
I snapped his mumma's neck.

45:39.400 --> 45:43.200
But when she shuffles off,

45:43.280 --> 45:46.200
we will have Golden Square.

45:46.280 --> 45:48.800
So that is what inspires you?

45:48.840 --> 45:50.280
Not wrong to have ambition.

45:53.840 --> 45:55.440
Come to the Magistrate's early.

46:00.840 --> 46:02.120
<i>Mm.</i>

46:02.200 --> 46:04.680
<i>What did the harlot want?</i>

46:04.760 --> 46:06.840
Cumberland sent her.

46:06.920 --> 46:09.200
Isn't he odious?

46:09.280 --> 46:10.680
<i>Pair of unfavorable dice</i>

46:10.760 --> 46:15.240
<i>and 500 pounds is blown off</i>
<i>on a breeze.</i>

46:15.280 --> 46:18.600
You are
a paragon of perjury.

46:18.680 --> 46:20.000
It's the truth!

46:22.760 --> 46:25.720
What's the money for,
my sweetling?

46:25.800 --> 46:28.800
<i>You know</i>
<i>I am a rogue with dice.</i>

46:28.840 --> 46:30.240
<i>You've done something naughty,</i>

46:30.280 --> 46:32.240
didn't you?

46:32.280 --> 46:33.360
Hm?

46:36.160 --> 46:39.120
<i>I lost that money on purpose,</i>

46:39.200 --> 46:40.440
and I'll continue to lose

46:40.560 --> 46:43.360
until you allow me
to control my own affairs.

46:43.440 --> 46:45.800
Is this a rebellion?

46:45.880 --> 46:48.800
Papa left
half his fortune to me.

46:48.880 --> 46:50.200
<i>Yes, but you can't manage it,</i>

46:50.280 --> 46:51.600
<i>as this childish antic proves.</i>

46:51.680 --> 46:54.360
It is my money.

46:54.440 --> 46:56.800
You know that I will always do
what is best for you.

47:06.320 --> 47:07.760
I don't want to be at odds

47:07.800 --> 47:09.280
with you, Harcourt.

47:11.720 --> 47:14.960
But you know I'm not
a little girl.

47:15.080 --> 47:16.920
I am a clever beast like you.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.840
Now give me what I want.

47:28.840 --> 47:29.920
<i>Sir?</i>

47:32.640 --> 47:33.560
Look.

47:33.640 --> 47:35.080
Where's my cut?

47:35.160 --> 47:37.000
Little minx.

47:37.120 --> 47:38.800
<i>Nance?</i>

47:38.880 --> 47:40.120
<i>Nance?</i>

47:40.200 --> 47:41.400
I've got us a witness.

47:41.480 --> 47:42.640
He can bind Quigley

47:42.720 --> 47:45.920
to the kidnap of those girls.

47:46.000 --> 47:47.200
Not on the chaise,

47:47.280 --> 47:50.160
she's too dirty.

47:51.880 --> 47:55.120
Emily Lacey will speak.

47:55.200 --> 47:57.440
So will this brave young man.

47:59.600 --> 48:00.800
We've got her.

48:01.760 --> 48:03.320
Fuck me.

48:03.400 --> 48:05.280
No, fuck me.

48:06.720 --> 48:08.240
Fuck you, Nancy Birch.

48:08.280 --> 48:09.200
Where's the gin?

48:09.280 --> 48:11.320
Lucy, get the gin.

48:12.840 --> 48:15.240
And you, you little rat face.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.400
I like you.

48:17.920 --> 48:20.120
Fanny, answer it.

48:20.200 --> 48:21.480
Tell them to wank!

48:22.440 --> 48:24.920
<i>One nice push...</i>

48:25.000 --> 48:26.760
She's in the fiery pit.

48:47.640 --> 48:49.120
Oh...

48:53.360 --> 48:55.440
Mrs. Wells!

48:57.680 --> 48:58.680
Kitty...

49:00.160 --> 49:02.080
Ma, Ma!

49:08.320 --> 49:09.320
Get her in.

49:15.440 --> 49:16.720
Oh God...
