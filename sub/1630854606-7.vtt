[cheerful music playing]

00:11.344 --> 00:12.303
[Mindy groans]

00:12.387 --> 00:14.305
Why don't guys
tell you what they're thinking?

00:14.389 --> 00:15.765
And save us the mystery?

00:16.307 --> 00:17.934
I'm guessing Nico texted again.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.061
<i>Oui.</i> Here. What do you think of this?

00:20.145 --> 00:22.897
[reading text]

00:23.023 --> 00:24.607
Oh, I think it sounds fun.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.318
But is it a date?
That doesn't sound like a date.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.112
Do you want it to be a date?

00:29.195 --> 00:33.199
I mean, I've liked him
since we were at boarding school,

00:34.325 --> 00:37.328
but maybe I'm just trying
to satisfy a teen crush, you know.

00:38.246 --> 00:39.372
-[cell phone chimes]
-Ugh!

00:39.456 --> 00:40.540
[reading text]

00:40.623 --> 00:41.708
-I'm not going.
-What?

00:41.833 --> 00:44.586
You have to. Come on, think of teen Mindy.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.880
-She's been wanting this for so long.
-[chuckles]

00:46.963 --> 00:48.214
I'll go with you.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.550
I'd love to talk to Nico
about our Soleil De Paris deck.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.553
-No.
-We pitched a collab with Gray Malin,

00:53.636 --> 00:55.764
-an amazing aerial photographer--
-Shh!

00:55.847 --> 00:57.182
No campaign chat.

00:57.265 --> 00:58.850
And you can't come solo.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.686
You need someone to distract you
while I distract Nico.

01:01.770 --> 01:02.604
Bring Alfie.

01:02.687 --> 01:05.023
I would, but he's in London
for his mom's birthday.

01:05.106 --> 01:06.566
<i>Bonjour,</i> neighbors.

01:06.649 --> 01:07.609
<i>-Bonjour.</i>
-Hi.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.403
Fetching your own breakfast?
Where's your boulangerie bish?

01:10.987 --> 01:14.199
She's referring to Camille.
I wouldn't run with that nickname.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.992
She's in Greece with Sofia.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.118
<i>-Excusez-moi?</i>
-What?

01:17.619 --> 01:19.496
The last stop to her art exhibition.

01:19.996 --> 01:20.914
Incredible, right?

01:20.997 --> 01:22.916
<i>-Très bien.</i>
-That's amazing.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.334
[both chuckle awkwardly]

01:24.417 --> 01:26.044
Wait, what do you make of this?

01:26.795 --> 01:29.547
Is he inviting me on a date
or is it just a group hang?

01:29.631 --> 01:30.799
Answer truthfully.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.383
A group hang.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.095
See. Want to come see a movie tonight?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.806
No, he can't, he's busy working.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.140
The restaurant's closed

01:39.224 --> 01:41.518
and Camille's away,
so I'm on my own tonight.

01:41.601 --> 01:44.187
<i>Bon!</i> Problem solved.
I will text you the deets.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.855
Great. <i>Bonne journée.</i>

01:45.939 --> 01:46.856
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.110
-Oh, my God, Mindy.
-No, wait, wait.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.695
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.198
Nothing's gonna happen
between you and Gabriel.

01:55.281 --> 01:58.660
No, I'm talking about the fact
that Camille is in Greece with Sofia.

01:58.743 --> 02:01.204
This is way more serious than just a kiss.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.039
Do I say something to Gabriel?

02:03.123 --> 02:06.417
No, only if you want to get in the middle
of their relationship drama again.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.545
-[sighs]
-Maybe it's nothing.

02:08.628 --> 02:11.756
And if it is something,
let Camille tell him herself.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.508
[Emily sighs]

02:29.941 --> 02:31.901
I thought Gregory Dupree was showing us

02:31.985 --> 02:34.279
the Air France uniforms
he's designed for the pitch?

02:34.362 --> 02:36.531
-He just called to move it.
-To when?

02:36.614 --> 02:38.658
The better question would be, to where?

02:38.741 --> 02:40.243
Luc, you know I hate riddles.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.996
Okay, Gregory now wants us
to meet him at his atelier.

02:43.079 --> 02:46.457
Apparently his redesign cannot
be contained to a conference room.

02:46.541 --> 02:49.711
To… Does he know
the client expects his submission today?

02:49.794 --> 02:50.670
Yes, he does.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.755
Hope you haven't gotten his hopes up.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.966
I've spoken to my contacts at Air France.

02:55.049 --> 02:57.760
Chanel and Louis Vuitton
are the present frontrunners.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.262
You think he has a chance?

02:59.345 --> 03:01.264
I don't, but I've been wrong before.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.348
When?

03:02.432 --> 03:04.893
Well, ask Emily,
I'm sure she journaled about it.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.272
Well, there's been
really nothing that specific.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.901
Oh, it's good to keep a journal
of your time in Paris.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.361
Did you read <i>The Diary of Anaïs Nin?</i>

03:16.029 --> 03:17.238
-No, I haven't.
-No?

03:17.864 --> 03:22.577
Such a marvelous account
of a young woman's sexual awakening.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.996
She was truly insatiable.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.373
Huh.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.839
So, this is Gregory's atelier.

03:35.506 --> 03:39.344
It's like a fashion war room.
You can just smell the creativity.

03:39.427 --> 03:41.012
No, that's marijuana, Emily.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.514
[Gregory] <i>Bonjour,</i> First Class.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.977
This is your captain speaking.

03:49.646 --> 03:55.068
Everyone, take your seats, buckle up.
There will be turbulence.

03:55.151 --> 03:56.527
Will drinks be served?

03:56.611 --> 03:58.655
You will be served. Trust.

03:59.239 --> 04:03.201
Now, before you see the uniforms,
let me explain my concept.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.371
This is a story about control.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.415
The experience of flying strips you of it.

04:09.999 --> 04:14.379
The minute you sit down,
the flight attendants control everything.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.757
They strap you in,
they instruct you how to breathe.

04:17.840 --> 04:21.719
They tell you when to sleep,
when to wake, when to eat.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.222
You are their subs.

04:24.806 --> 04:29.769
So if they want to be such doms,
I say, dress them as doms.

04:30.353 --> 04:36.651
Passengers, this is my submission
for the <i>nouveau</i> Air France.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.528
[upbeat music playing]

04:56.546 --> 04:59.966
Condoms, lube and poppers.

05:00.049 --> 05:01.551
This is good for your journal.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.360
And?

05:20.278 --> 05:23.072
Well, this will
certainly surprise Air France.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.783
You've given their uniform
quite a makeover.

05:25.867 --> 05:26.701
[Gregory] Emily.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.119
[Emily] Oh, uh…

05:28.202 --> 05:29.996
They're beautifully constructed.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.414
Subversive and, you know,

05:31.497 --> 05:34.167
bondage is totally
dominating runways right now.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.501
Pun intended.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.087
Well, that might be true,

05:38.171 --> 05:43.217
but I don't think Air France
is wanting to push the needle this far.

05:43.801 --> 05:47.972
Gregory, I've seen Chanel's submission.
Understated and chic.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.725
[cell phone ringing]

05:51.934 --> 05:54.187
<i>Désolé,</i> I have to take this.

05:57.648 --> 05:58.608
<i>Allô?</i>

05:59.609 --> 06:02.779
I don't think you understand
how much I need this account.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.281
My business is in trouble.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.034
If I don't have a business,
you don't have a business.

06:08.993 --> 06:11.746
Would you ever consider
presenting that ensemble,

06:11.829 --> 06:14.457
but without the belts, boot and cap?

06:15.500 --> 06:16.834
And kill all the elegance?

06:16.918 --> 06:20.004
I'm submitting them as they are.
With or without your help.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.590
Let's go, girls.

06:32.266 --> 06:35.561
[sighs] That was Pierre.
He was very upset.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.522
His new store opens next week

06:37.605 --> 06:40.024
and he's sounding
very erratic and paranoid.

06:40.108 --> 06:43.486
Since he sold his company to JVMA,
he doesn't know who he can trust.

06:43.569 --> 06:47.490
Ah, he should have thought of that
before he abandoned us.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.242
He's not our problem anymore.

06:49.325 --> 06:51.911
Let's not forget,
he did try to throw us a lifeline.

06:51.994 --> 06:54.080
And now he's begging for our help.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.415
Well, what can we do?

06:55.498 --> 06:59.502
He's asked us to meet him at the store
and give him our professional opinion.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.587
Can we do that? We don't represent him.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.798
Look, we've been through
a lot with Pierre.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.675
He's not just an ex-client. He's a friend.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.469
And now he needs us, so we're going.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.351
Where are you taking us?

07:15.435 --> 07:18.146
This is where Pierre told us to meet.
He dropped a pin.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.605
He knows how to drop a pin?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.316
Did anyone see you?

07:22.400 --> 07:23.818
-No.
-Are we being followed?

07:23.901 --> 07:26.154
Pierre, is this espionage necessary?
Really?

07:26.237 --> 07:30.074
<i>Oui.</i> No one from JVMA
can know you're here.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.701
Especially Nicolas.

07:31.784 --> 07:35.830
Papa's little puppet.
He has his spies everywhere. Come in.

07:36.664 --> 07:37.498
Go.

07:40.793 --> 07:41.961
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>

07:45.256 --> 07:46.883
[Emily] So many Pierres.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.802
JVMA dedicated so much floor space

07:49.886 --> 07:54.307
to your ringarde line it's…
oh, overwhelming.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.516
[Pierre] <i>Exactement.</i>

07:55.600 --> 08:00.062
They missed the point.
When it is this much, it's not irony.

08:00.146 --> 08:01.898
It actually is <i>ringarde.</i>

08:01.981 --> 08:04.025
[Pierre] What do you think
of the quality?

08:04.108 --> 08:05.985
-Honestly?
-Brutally.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.072
Well, it's more mass market
than I expected.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.242
Très chic. <i>It's a Ca-do.</i>

08:13.326 --> 08:14.744
[Emily] Oh, wow.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.705
<i>-Merci.</i>
-Isn't it ghastly?

08:18.456 --> 08:22.210
They've turned me into a clown
trapped in a funhouse mirror.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.213
Désolé, <i>that's a Ca-don't.</i>

08:25.296 --> 08:29.717
What did Nicolas say when you told him
you weren't happy with all of this?

08:30.343 --> 08:34.472
He didn't care.
No one at JVMA cares what I think.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.892
I have no one. I'm completely alone.

08:37.975 --> 08:41.145
No, that's not true, okay. You have us.

08:41.812 --> 08:45.024
I had you. This deal was a mistake.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.359
I want to end it.

08:46.442 --> 08:47.860
No, careful, Pierre.

08:47.944 --> 08:52.490
If you leave, they'd still own your name
and… clearly, your face.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.451
<i>You're ready for the runway.</i>

08:56.202 --> 08:57.161
[in French] Shut the fuck up!

08:58.246 --> 08:59.205
Shh!

09:02.667 --> 09:04.085
-[in English] Hi.
-[Mindy] Hi.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.461
Where have you been?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.755
I'm auditioning three outfits
to wear tonight

09:07.838 --> 09:11.509
and I almost gave up until I found this.

09:11.592 --> 09:14.136
It was delivered to you today
from Gregory Dupree.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.054
Mindy.

09:15.137 --> 09:18.266
Well, I'm sorry,
I only opened the box, not the note.

09:18.349 --> 09:21.352
I can't control myself
when fashion lands on my doorstep.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.020
-Our doorstep.
-Yes.

09:24.021 --> 09:28.150
"Air France said no." [sighs]
"Wear this to my funeral."

09:29.527 --> 09:33.114
Air France declined his designs
for their new uniform.

09:33.614 --> 09:37.618
Well, one airline's trash
is another woman's treasure.

09:38.202 --> 09:41.205
What, you want to dress
like a sexy flight attendant?

09:41.289 --> 09:45.376
Oh, what, you don't think
Britney looks iconic in her "Toxic" video?

09:45.459 --> 09:47.795
Well, you certainly
will make an impression.

09:47.878 --> 09:49.213
Ooh!

09:49.714 --> 09:51.799
Please prepare for an emergency landing.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.637
[upbeat instrumental rock music playing]

10:02.184 --> 10:03.603
<i>Bonsoir, bonsoir.</i>

10:03.686 --> 10:05.438
[in French] Everyone,
this is Mindy Chen, who looks…

10:06.314 --> 10:07.148
incredible.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.985
-[in English] Hey.
-Good to see you again.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.278
You too, Nicolas.

10:12.361 --> 10:13.696
I brought a little picnic.

10:13.779 --> 10:16.907
Thank you for your invitation,
a few things we serve at the restaurant.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.993
-Thank you, Chef…
-Gabriel.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.579
My restaurant is Chez Lavaux,
you're welcome anytime.

10:21.662 --> 10:22.705
It'd be my pleasure.

10:22.788 --> 10:24.957
And I brought rosé
all the way from Provence.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.417
[chuckles]

10:27.543 --> 10:29.295
I love your look. Where is it from?

10:29.378 --> 10:31.756
It was a gift
from a designer Emily works with.

10:31.839 --> 10:32.840
Gregory Dupree.

10:32.923 --> 10:35.926
Really? I heard his last show
at Versailles was amazing.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.679
It was. He's so underrated.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.973
You know, his work deserves
a much bigger spotlight.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.225
Well, it's shining pretty bright now.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.185
Aw.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.939
[guitar music playing]

10:59.950 --> 11:01.869
Here. Have one of mine.

11:01.952 --> 11:03.162
<i>Oh, merci.</i>

11:03.913 --> 11:05.039
Have you bought too much?

11:05.665 --> 11:06.999
It's a bad habit.

11:07.083 --> 11:08.084
[chuckles]

11:08.959 --> 11:12.463
So, I happened to walk by
your new store for Pierre.

11:12.546 --> 11:15.800
Very mysterious. You're really
keeping that one under wraps.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.843
How's it going with him?

11:17.927 --> 11:20.846
Well, I do have
a new-found respect for you.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.765
You do? Why?

11:22.848 --> 11:27.103
I don't know how you dealt with him
for so long. He's infuriating.

11:27.770 --> 11:31.148
He wanted a minimalistic store,
so that's what we gave him,

11:31.232 --> 11:34.068
then he wanted it to be
loud and bold like ringarde,

11:34.151 --> 11:36.779
so we pivoted to that,
and now he hates it again.

11:37.321 --> 11:39.990
He's never satisfied.
Was he like that with you?

11:41.701 --> 11:44.412
Pierre's insecurities
can certainly take the wheel,

11:44.495 --> 11:46.163
but just be patient with him.

11:46.247 --> 11:49.125
I mean, we encountered
similar issues during Fashion Week.

11:49.208 --> 11:52.002
You just have to make sure
you handle him well,

11:52.086 --> 11:54.588
otherwise he could
skip the opening altogether.

11:54.672 --> 11:57.091
It's not my first time
with a demanding designer.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.052
The store opens with or without him.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.471
Right, well…

12:03.514 --> 12:04.682
You know he trusts us,

12:04.765 --> 12:08.018
so if there's anything that you need us
to help with, let me know.

12:08.853 --> 12:09.854
Excuse me, Emily.

12:12.189 --> 12:13.983
What were you two talking about?

12:14.066 --> 12:16.861
-You, obviously.
-You were talking work.

12:16.944 --> 12:19.989
Damn it, Em, are you going to be like this
every time we're on a date?

12:20.072 --> 12:21.991
Oh, so this is a date.

12:22.074 --> 12:23.159
It's got to be.

12:23.242 --> 12:25.828
He touched my back,
introduced me to his friends.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.873
One of them told me
this is a notorious hook-up spot.

12:28.956 --> 12:30.458
Go get it, girl.

12:31.125 --> 12:31.959
[Gabriel] Hey.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.254
-Hi. [chuckles]
-Care to join me?

12:37.089 --> 12:38.090
[both chuckle softly]

12:56.650 --> 12:57.985
<i>No. We're moving too fast.</i>

12:59.862 --> 13:00.905
<i>You're right.</i>

13:01.739 --> 13:02.907
<i>It's too fast.</i>

13:06.368 --> 13:07.745
[moaning]

13:11.123 --> 13:12.500
-Sorry.
<i>-Désolé.</i>

13:15.753 --> 13:16.796
[woman in film] <i>Too fast.</i>

13:16.879 --> 13:18.214
[in French] Your food was so delicious.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.216
Like mouth-wateringly good.

13:21.258 --> 13:22.176
Um…

13:22.259 --> 13:23.302
<i>Merci.</i>

13:23.803 --> 13:25.137
Nice of you to say.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.097
Well, if you knew me,

13:27.181 --> 13:29.225
you'd know I'm not that nice.

13:30.142 --> 13:31.977
[laughs]

13:32.061 --> 13:33.896
[Gabriel chuckles politely]

13:35.481 --> 13:38.192
Hi, sorry, some people are trying
to watch the movie.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.653
So just shush a little bit.

13:40.736 --> 13:42.321
-Thanks.
-No, they're not.

13:42.404 --> 13:43.697
How long have you been together?

13:44.740 --> 13:46.742
-It's…
-We're not together.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.994
-He has a girlfriend who's in Greece.
-Yeah.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.996
-We're just friends.
-Friends.

13:53.457 --> 13:56.377
So she's your friend
while your girlfriend's in Greece?

13:56.460 --> 13:59.296
I could be your friend too.
We could all be friends.

13:59.421 --> 14:01.006
It's not like that.
She has a boyfriend.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.341
Yeah. [chuckles]

14:02.424 --> 14:04.552
-And where is he?
-London.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.221
Oh, I get the game now.

14:07.304 --> 14:10.432
So your girlfriend's in Greece,
your boyfriend's in London.

14:10.516 --> 14:14.061
Well, my boyfriend's in… Berlin.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.313
And I miss him so much.

14:16.814 --> 14:18.524
[all laugh]

14:18.607 --> 14:21.235
This is fun. You two are fun.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.029
Okay. Emily, should we…

14:24.488 --> 14:26.824
-That, that thing…
-Oh, yeah, we should go.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.492
I've seen this movie a thousand times

14:28.617 --> 14:30.202
-and they end up together.
-Classic.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.287
-Cliché.
-So good.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.122
-But, so… It's great.
-So good.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.164
-Love it.
-Enjoy it.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.166
-Thank you for everything.
-So sweet.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.585
We're going to go.

14:37.668 --> 14:38.502
Have fun.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.299
<i>Guys, a woman's purse, all right,</i>
<i>it's her secret source of power.</i>

14:43.382 --> 14:45.843
<i>There are many</i>
<i>dark and dangerous things in there</i>

14:45.926 --> 14:47.887
<i>that we, the male species,</i>
<i>should know nothing about.</i>

14:57.396 --> 15:01.317
So, what's the verdict?
Is Nicolas into Mindy or no?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.819
Uh, sadly, I think not.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.864
He would've at least tried to kiss her,
if he was.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.825
Maybe he's not into
public displays of affection.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.328
Everyone else sure was.

15:12.870 --> 15:13.704
Right?

15:13.787 --> 15:16.457
I never knew
that movie was such a turn-on for people.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.501
Everyone likes watching a story
about two people

15:19.585 --> 15:22.546
trying to fight off
their natural attraction to each other.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.843
[people clamoring]

15:27.927 --> 15:29.178
What's going on in there?

15:29.762 --> 15:30.930
[Gabriel] I don't know.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.181
Let's check it out.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.812
[whimsical music playing]

15:41.815 --> 15:43.984
Wow, his is so surreal.

15:44.568 --> 15:47.154
I feel like we're walking
into heaven on acid.

15:47.237 --> 15:49.156
-You've taken acid?
-Well, no.

15:49.239 --> 15:52.368
But I've read Hunter S. Thompson,
so I get the gist.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.954
Well, on the count of <i>trois?</i>

15:55.454 --> 15:56.372
[Emily chuckles]

15:57.831 --> 16:00.167
<i>-Un, deux, trois!</i>
<i>-Deux…</i>

16:02.670 --> 16:04.713
[music continues playing]

16:06.715 --> 16:08.717
[imperceptible]

16:21.563 --> 16:22.398
Hey!

16:48.215 --> 16:49.049
[gasps]

16:49.633 --> 16:50.884
No more posting.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.177
No, no, no, no, no!

16:56.098 --> 16:58.142
[in French] So nice to meet you.
Good night.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.644
Thanks for the beautiful champagne.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.813
-See you Saturday.
-Saturday, yes.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.902
[in English] I'm headed this way.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.320
So good night.

17:10.904 --> 17:12.573
Good night? Already?

17:14.366 --> 17:15.409
How about a drink?

17:17.494 --> 17:18.746
Sure, if you want to.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.289
'Course I want to.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.500
You think I brought you here
just to see a film?

17:23.584 --> 17:25.127
Honestly, I don't know what to think.

17:25.210 --> 17:29.506
I have no idea if you're…
like, even into me.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.759
I have no idea if you're even into <i>me.</i>

17:31.842 --> 17:34.219
Come on, seriously? In this?

17:35.304 --> 17:37.139
You look incredible tonight.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.850
Every man there was checking you out.

17:39.933 --> 17:41.518
Yeah, except for you.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.771
Believe me, I noticed.

17:44.271 --> 17:49.151
It took every ounce of willpower
not to make a spectacle of myself.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.362
Really?

17:53.322 --> 17:54.156
Really.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.284
So, what now?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.203
You tell me.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.332
-You're the one dressed as a dominatrix.
-[chuckles]

18:03.415 --> 18:04.416
You're in charge.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.184
[cell phone vibrating]

18:22.267 --> 18:24.269
I think your crotch is vibrating.

18:27.022 --> 18:30.901
Pierre Cadault.
This fucking guy. I swear to God.

18:31.693 --> 18:33.320
We can rain check on the drink.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.614
-I don't mind.
-I mind.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.367
I finally get to kiss you and…

18:43.705 --> 18:45.374
-[cell phone vibrates]
-[chuckles]

18:45.457 --> 18:46.542
Unbelievable.

18:47.751 --> 18:50.462
-Okay. Yes. Sorry, I should…
-Yeah. You should do that.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.382
-I should deal with this nightmare.
-Yeah.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.010
Next time we'll skip the movie?

18:58.178 --> 18:59.012
Good idea.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.614
Oh, Camille liked my story.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.201
She said, "So fun.
It's my favorite movie."

19:21.285 --> 19:22.119
Really?

<i>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days?</i>

19:25.497 --> 19:27.583
I feel like that's what
she's trying to do to me.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.001
Oh.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.839
She hasn't been replying
to any of my texts very quickly.

19:33.922 --> 19:34.756
Or at all.

19:40.345 --> 19:42.639
How about when Alfie and Camille get back,

19:42.723 --> 19:44.224
we take them to Pop Air?

19:44.808 --> 19:47.311
You know. Like, a real double date.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.355
Yeah. I'd like that.

19:54.067 --> 19:56.195
-Good night.
-Good night.

20:17.841 --> 20:21.261
[Nicolas] Bonjour, <i>Emily.</i>
<i>It seems your persistence has paid off.</i>

20:21.345 --> 20:23.055
Oh, God, what have I done now?

20:23.138 --> 20:25.265
No, it's all good. I hope.

20:25.349 --> 20:29.186
If you were serious about Agence Grateau
helping us out with Pierre Cadault…

20:29.269 --> 20:30.938
What? Oh, my God, of course!

20:31.021 --> 20:32.189
Uh, um…

20:32.272 --> 20:35.859
Sorry. Nicolas, will you please hold
one moment for Sylvie Grateau?

20:41.698 --> 20:43.033
What's going on?

20:44.034 --> 20:45.452
You have Sylvie.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.829
[Nicolas] Bonjour, <i>Sylvie.</i>
<i>As I was saying,</i>

20:47.913 --> 20:50.791
I'd like to hire Agence Grateau
to help with Pierre Cadault.

20:51.750 --> 20:52.960
Well, we'd be delighted.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.796
<i>There's a lot to deal with</i>
<i>in a very short time.</i>

20:55.879 --> 20:57.756
<i>I hope you're adept in crisis marketing.</i>

Well, of course, it's our specialty.

<i>Let's discuss over lunch today.</i>

<i>I'll get my assistant</i>
<i>to send over the details.</i>

21:04.221 --> 21:06.014
-Okay, great. See you then.
<i>-Okay.</i>

21:08.433 --> 21:09.810
How did you do this?

21:09.893 --> 21:12.604
Well, I was trying
not to say anything, but--

21:12.688 --> 21:14.398
Yeah, okay. I don't want to know.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.401
<i>Merveilleux,</i> Emily.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.530
Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.242
Door!

21:27.536 --> 21:32.291
The only time I've heard Sylvie
say <i>"merveilleux"</i> was about a Chablis.

21:32.374 --> 21:33.917
-Mmm-hmm.
-You should text Pierre

21:34.001 --> 21:35.419
and tell him the good news.

21:35.502 --> 21:38.130
It's your news. You text him.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.105
[Julien] <i>Merci.</i>

21:56.481 --> 21:59.067
Pierre is so excited
that he will be joining us too.

21:59.693 --> 22:03.822
He never misses a champagne toast.
Especially when it's for him.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.744
Agence Grateau is bleeding me dry.

22:08.827 --> 22:12.039
I should've offered you more money
to join JVMA when I had the chance.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.207
You know it was never about the money.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.543
-It was about my independence.
-[Nicolas] I do.

22:16.626 --> 22:19.546
Thank you for the opportunity
to work with Pierre Cadault again.

22:19.629 --> 22:21.631
-To Pierre.
-To Pierre.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.592
[Nicolas] Well, just to be clear,

22:23.675 --> 22:26.178
you'll be working
for Pierre Cadault, the brand.

22:26.261 --> 22:27.971
Not Pierre Cadault, the man.

22:29.056 --> 22:31.224
<i>-Pardon?</i>
-Put it back on ice.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.394
What's going on, Nicolas?

22:34.478 --> 22:38.732
I refuse to let my acquisition
be hijacked by his irrational demands.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.942
The company is bigger than him.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.527
So, it's time he exits

22:42.611 --> 22:45.280
and we'll bring in a designer
to usher in the new era.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.574
But it's his company. His name.

22:47.657 --> 22:50.369
Correction. His name, my company.

22:50.952 --> 22:53.413
This is nothing new.
Christian Dior is now Dior.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.207
Yves Saint Laurent is now Saint Laurent.

22:55.290 --> 22:57.709
The men may be gone,
but the brands persist.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.795
It happens all the time, right, Sylvie?

23:00.754 --> 23:02.881
More times than I care to remember.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.257
And, thanks to Emily,

23:04.841 --> 23:06.343
I've done some research,

23:06.426 --> 23:08.804
and I think I've found
the perfect replacement.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.264
Gregory Dupree.

23:13.183 --> 23:15.685
You were right.
He deserves a bigger spotlight.

23:16.311 --> 23:17.521
He's a visionary.

23:17.604 --> 23:20.273
The perfect person
to reinvent Pierre Cadault.

23:20.357 --> 23:21.817
But Pierre hates Gregory.

23:22.317 --> 23:24.444
Well, since you know both of them,

23:24.528 --> 23:27.906
who better to handle the transition
and keep it from spiraling?

23:28.573 --> 23:30.033
Does Pierre know about this?

23:30.117 --> 23:31.576
You're actually the first to know.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.330
Gregory is one of your clients.
I imagine you're thrilled.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.208
Yeah. Well, definitely surprised.

23:38.291 --> 23:41.795
There's a lot we have to talk about
since we're going to be working together.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.350
Hi, there!

23:56.393 --> 23:57.769
What is he doing here?

23:57.853 --> 23:59.354
Care to explain, Emily?

-Pierre!
