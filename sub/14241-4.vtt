-I could have helped.
-No, you couldn't.

19:23.550 --> 19:25.381
I tell you everything.

19:26.430 --> 19:28.580
Yeah? So, tell me,
what should I have done?

19:28.670 --> 19:30.308
Stood up to them.

19:30.790 --> 19:33.668
The Jack I know would have
stood up to them.

19:35.910 --> 19:38.902
I've only just scraped
the surface, haven't I?

19:40.470 --> 19:42.540
Ianto, that's all there is.

19:42.990 --> 19:46.027
No. You pretend that's all there is.

19:46.870 --> 19:50.180
I've lived a long time.
I have done a lot of things.

19:54.390 --> 19:56.665
I've gotta go. I won't be long.

19:57.150 --> 19:59.345
IANTO: You're doing it again.

19:59.670 --> 20:01.342
Speak to me, Jack.

20:02.350 --> 20:04.102
Where are you going?

20:05.310 --> 20:07.221
To call Frobisher.
I can't make the call from here

20:07.310 --> 20:10.461
'cause they'll be able to trace it.
Is that okay?

20:11.750 --> 20:13.342
You're the boss.

20:13.870 --> 20:15.940
And just so you know,
I have a daughter called Alice,

20:16.030 --> 20:20.182
and a grandson called Steven and
Frobisher took them hostage yesterday.

20:43.830 --> 20:46.663
You two should get
a couple of hours' sleep while you can.

20:46.750 --> 20:47.865
So should you.

20:47.950 --> 20:50.020
(MOBILE RINGING)

20:51.390 --> 20:54.507
It's Harkness. Ring Ashton Down,
see if you can get a trace on it.

20:54.710 --> 20:56.666
Strong coffee, loads of.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.820
-Hello?
-Have you thought about what I said?

21:00.910 --> 21:03.947
-Bit busy, to be honest.
-Let me put this right.

21:04.150 --> 21:06.505
Release my family
and we can work together.

21:06.670 --> 21:08.547
Give yourself up
and they won't be harmed.

21:08.630 --> 21:11.588
-JACK: <i>I wish I could believe that.</i>
<i>-You can.</i>

21:12.710 --> 21:15.588
JACK: <i>You've spoken to the 456,</i>
<i>haven't you?</i>

21:16.310 --> 21:19.586
-They want more children.
-What makes you think that?

21:19.670 --> 21:22.309
-They're onto it now.
<i>-Doesn't take a genius.</i>

21:22.390 --> 21:26.065
With them so going public this time,
I think they want a lot more.

21:26.150 --> 21:27.629
<i>Millions, even.</i>

21:27.790 --> 21:32.068
If I have to stop you, then I'll tell
the world what's really going on.

21:32.230 --> 21:34.619
There's too much at stake not to.

21:40.830 --> 21:43.503
Lost him.
I'll try the Echelon satellite data.

21:43.590 --> 21:45.626
<i>It's gonna take some time.</i>

21:46.390 --> 21:49.348
They'll let us know
when they get a location.

21:50.430 --> 21:52.261
He'll be gone by then.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.899
Why don't you get your head
down on the couch for an hour?

21:57.870 --> 22:01.863
Sorry.
Um, the Prime Minister wants to see you.

22:16.870 --> 22:20.067
Take notes. Facilitate. Generally
make sure it all runs smoothly.

22:20.150 --> 22:22.027
The most important thing is
to blend into the background.

22:22.110 --> 22:24.419
No one should know we're there.

22:26.270 --> 22:29.501
Cabinet office briefing room A. COBRA.

22:29.590 --> 22:32.263
Where all the emergency
planning takes place.

22:32.470 --> 22:35.109
Gold Command meeting's about to start.

22:35.350 --> 22:38.547
They'll sell us out,
just like they did last time.

22:41.150 --> 22:43.425
I'm sorry to hear about your family,
by the way.

22:43.510 --> 22:45.228
We'll get them out.

22:45.390 --> 22:47.346
-I know we will.
<i>-Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

22:47.430 --> 22:51.105
<i>it's been decided</i>
<i>we're going to make the 456 an offer.</i>

22:53.110 --> 22:55.988
A realistic number,
something we can manage,

22:57.670 --> 23:01.583
-and then we see what happens.
-You mean we're going to haggle?

23:02.070 --> 23:03.867
What about the military option?

23:03.950 --> 23:06.225
ODUYA: There's nothing
to take action against.

23:06.310 --> 23:10.622
Evidently, the 456 must have some
sort of base of operations in orbit,

23:11.270 --> 23:13.943
but our satellites are showing nothing.

23:14.030 --> 23:17.067
Whatever's up there,
it's beyond our technology.

23:17.150 --> 23:19.380
There's a target sat in Thames House.

23:19.470 --> 23:22.064
ODUYA: Taking that out would be
a declaration of war.

23:22.190 --> 23:23.942
A war we can't win.

23:24.030 --> 23:26.942
That's why I've invited
John to address Gold Command.

23:27.030 --> 23:31.945
In terms of managing the figures,
what could we offer and get away with?

23:32.070 --> 23:35.062
<i>-We need to know...</i>
-Isn't it, isn't it?

23:35.150 --> 23:36.708
It's happening again.

23:36.790 --> 23:39.304
My God, they're really gonna do this.

23:39.390 --> 23:42.143
Look, it won't just be Britain, will it?

23:42.430 --> 23:47.026
The idea is that every country makes
a camouflageable contribution.

23:48.110 --> 23:50.544
<i>Can you pass me the FAS file, please?</i>

23:50.630 --> 23:53.986
SAS? Oh, now you're talking.

23:56.350 --> 23:58.068
Right, well, um...

24:04.990 --> 24:09.268
For a start, there are 21 children
in Oakington right now. 21 units.

24:09.790 --> 24:12.987

awaiting deportation.

24:13.150 --> 24:14.902

There's progress for you.

24:24.150 --> 24:26.220
And no one would miss them.

24:28.990 --> 24:30.423
We need more.

24:31.310 --> 24:33.744
Can you bump the numbers up to 60?

24:37.830 --> 24:39.183
I think so.

24:39.830 --> 24:42.469
Uh, we could have them all in Oakington
by first thing tomorrow.

24:42.550 --> 24:46.828
Thank you, John. Now go back to
Thames House and consult with the 456.

24:47.510 --> 24:50.343
Make them an offer
of 60 units and no more.

there's nothing to worry about.

I'm sorry, but we have
discussed your demands

26:36.710 --> 26:40.589

that might satisfy both parties.

6,700.

Six-seven-zero-zero,
that's our final offer.

some time to think about it.

<i>zero, zero, zero.</i>

You are turning this house
into a bloody playschool.

27:42.070 --> 27:44.061

It's muggins here, that's who.

29:06.190 --> 29:08.750
Every country is saying
a different number,

which, in each case, amounts to 1 0percent .

29:13.870 --> 29:18.102
I think it's fair to say that our
final offer has just been rejected.

29:20.390 --> 29:23.223
Okay, thanks, everyone.
Let's take a break.

29:29.830 --> 29:31.980
It's worth considering, sir.

29:32.070 --> 29:35.426
The world's population will be
9 billion by 2050.

29:35.750 --> 29:37.900
That's a two-and-a-half billion rise.

29:38.110 --> 29:41.500
The UK will go from 61 million to 77,
every one of them needing

29:41.590 --> 29:45.469
-food and water, a home, transport...
-Rick, Rick, Rick, Rick.

29:46.190 --> 29:50.229
What are you suggesting,
a cull of ten percent would do us good?

29:50.310 --> 29:52.380
I'm just saying, if we need
to spin this to the public,

29:52.470 --> 29:55.268
and God knows, at the moment,
spin is all we can do,

29:55.390 --> 29:59.178
then in an age when we're terrified
by the planet's dwindling resources,

29:59.270 --> 30:00.749
a reduction in the population

30:00.830 --> 30:03.628
could possibly, just possibly,
if presented in the right way,

30:03.710 --> 30:05.940
be seen as...good.

30:07.190 --> 30:08.259
Sir?

30:11.990 --> 30:14.265
-Anything?
-It's all gone quiet.

30:14.630 --> 30:16.029
All our usual sources
from the government,

30:16.110 --> 30:18.943
the army, Whitehall, all gone silent.

30:19.030 --> 30:21.624
Whatever's happening in London,
no one's breathing a word.

30:21.710 --> 30:24.270
It's about time I found out
what's going on.

30:24.350 --> 30:26.784
I'm taking a squad to London.
Are the roads still blocked?

30:26.870 --> 30:29.464
-Only in the centre.
-Then patch me through a clear route.

30:29.550 --> 30:31.666
And keep watching for Harkness.
If it's happening in London,

30:31.750 --> 30:33.820
then that's where he'll be.

30:37.990 --> 30:41.426
With regrets, ladies and gentlemen,
I have to tell you

30:41.510 --> 30:44.502
that we're now facing
the worst-case scenario.

30:46.550 --> 30:49.860
And right now we don't have time
for our discussion on ethics.

30:49.950 --> 30:52.020
I'm afraid the hand-wringing
will have to wait.

30:52.110 --> 30:56.501
All we can do at the moment
is to address a number of vital

30:57.390 --> 30:59.346
and practical questions.

31:00.270 --> 31:03.740
Namely, how do we select the ten percent
who would go?

31:04.550 --> 31:08.259
How would we transport them?
And how could we sell it to the voters?

31:08.350 --> 31:09.465
John?

31:10.070 --> 31:12.709
-Well, the selection's not down to me.
-Nevertheless.

31:12.790 --> 31:15.588
Practical solutions, please.

31:16.910 --> 31:20.141
Once the selection has been made
then my department can arrange to bus

31:20.230 --> 31:22.505
all the children
to the rendezvous points together,

31:22.590 --> 31:24.228
school by school.

31:24.390 --> 31:27.507
My staff are compiling
various school databases.

31:28.790 --> 31:32.624
IANTO: ''You just need to decide
what criteria you'd use for selection.''

31:33.750 --> 31:36.583
Which is out of my hands.
Over to you, sir.

31:39.630 --> 31:40.824
Anyone?

31:44.910 --> 31:47.708
Might I remind you the clock is ticking?

31:47.790 --> 31:51.544
-It would have to be random.
-No one'll believe it was random,

31:51.630 --> 31:53.700
not unless some of us are seen waiting
at the school gates

31:53.790 --> 31:57.703
-for empty buses to return.
-If the criteria is demonstrably fair

31:57.790 --> 32:00.623
and entirely random, then at least
we could defend ourselves...

32:00.710 --> 32:04.020
So you're willing to risk your kids
to make it look fair?

32:04.110 --> 32:06.863
-Then how else can we choose?
-We could do it alphabetically.

32:06.950 --> 32:08.941
Oh, yes, thanks Mr Yates.

32:09.030 --> 32:11.100
I didn't mean... I've got no kids.
I wasn't trying to...

32:11.190 --> 32:14.182
Yes, no kids and no consequences.
And yours have already grown up.

32:14.270 --> 32:15.339
Let's keep this civil, Denise.

32:15.430 --> 32:18.388
Oh, yes, let's discuss the loss
of millions of innocent children

32:18.470 --> 32:22.258
-and let's be civilised about it!
-If you wouldn't mind, yes.

32:22.510 --> 32:26.219
Could we limit it to one loss
per family? Every second-born child...

32:26.310 --> 32:29.746
That would take more time.
More organisation. Time we don't have.

32:29.830 --> 32:33.106
So, it would have to be
one school at a time.

32:39.710 --> 32:42.383
Look, I'm going to say
what everyone else is thinking.

32:42.470 --> 32:47.749
If this...this lottery takes place,
my kids aren't in it.

32:48.750 --> 32:52.299
<i>I'm sure the families of Gold Command</i>
<i>would be exempted anyway.</i>

32:52.430 --> 32:54.022
<i>In fact, isn't that official policy?</i>

32:54.110 --> 32:56.419
Gang of bastards. Isn't it?

32:56.510 --> 32:59.104
<i>During a major civil emergency,</i>
<i>we're also dealing</i>

32:59.190 --> 33:01.499
<i>with deeply debilitating personal grief.</i>

33:01.590 --> 33:03.342
-Listen to them.
<i>-Hard enough as it is.</i>

33:03.430 --> 33:05.182
<i>I'm right, aren't I?</i>

33:05.310 --> 33:08.427
<i>It is official policy</i>
<i>that our families get protection.</i>

33:08.510 --> 33:10.068
Of course they bloody do.

33:10.150 --> 33:12.869
So, we could have a show of hands.
I hate to be crass,

33:12.990 --> 33:15.379
-but in the circumstances...
-Well, who votes?

33:15.470 --> 33:17.779
Those with kids
or those with no interest to declare?

33:17.870 --> 33:22.102
No one votes. It's down to me
to make an executive decision.

33:22.870 --> 33:24.940
-Do you need some time?
-No.

33:28.190 --> 33:31.227
Whatever happens,
the children and grandchildren

33:31.310 --> 33:34.188
of everyone round this table
will be exempt.

33:39.870 --> 33:41.906
-What about nieces and neph...
-Don't push your luck.

33:41.990 --> 33:44.550
You seriously expect me
to look my brother in the eye...

33:44.630 --> 33:47.542
We need to limit the number
of people who know.

33:47.630 --> 33:50.098
-Just give him a condolence card?
-That's the responsibility

33:50.190 --> 33:53.944
-of government, Denise!
-No, the first responsibility

33:54.870 --> 33:58.385
is to protect the best interests
of this country, right?

33:59.390 --> 34:01.142
Then, let's say it.

34:02.110 --> 34:05.944
In a national emergency,
a country must plan for the future

34:06.430 --> 34:09.866
and discriminate between those
who are vital to continued stability

34:09.949 --> 34:12.304
and those who are not.

34:13.150 --> 34:15.266
And now that we've established
that our kids are exempt,

34:15.350 --> 34:17.625
the whole principle of random selection
is dead in the water, anyway.

34:17.710 --> 34:20.827
-Only so far as...
-Let me finish. Now, look,

34:21.310 --> 34:23.266
on the one hand,
you've got the good schools.

34:23.350 --> 34:25.864
And I don't just mean those
producing graduates.

34:25.949 --> 34:31.467
I mean the pupils who will go on
to staff our hospitals, our offices,

34:31.750 --> 34:34.583
our factories, the workforce
of the future.

34:34.710 --> 34:37.429
We need them. Accepted, yes?

34:37.949 --> 34:41.989
So, set against that,
you've got the failing schools,

34:42.310 --> 34:45.347
full of the less able,
the less socially useful,

34:45.750 --> 34:48.389
those destined to spend
a lifetime on benefits,

34:48.510 --> 34:52.708
occupying places on the dole queue
and, frankly, the prisons.

34:53.550 --> 34:56.303
Now, look, should we treat them equally?

34:59.830 --> 35:02.139
God knows we've tried and we've failed.

35:02.230 --> 35:05.267
And now the time has come to choose.

35:08.470 --> 35:13.100
And if we can't identify
the lowest achieving ten percent

35:13.710 --> 35:15.826
of this country's children,

35:16.310 --> 35:19.143
then what are
the school league tables for?

35:33.030 --> 35:35.464
Anyone want to speak against that?

35:50.790 --> 35:52.542
Then there we have it.

35:52.630 --> 35:55.383
John, you have your criteria.

35:55.990 --> 35:58.265
We've selected the ten percent.

36:12.230 --> 36:16.064
We've got enough evidence recorded here
to destroy every person in that room.

36:16.150 --> 36:19.028
And we can use it
to force our way into Thames House,

36:19.110 --> 36:21.419
finally get face-to-face
with this thing.

36:21.510 --> 36:23.705
And get your family released.

36:24.590 --> 36:25.864

what they're doing?

36:25.950 --> 36:27.702
What if I can't get Lois
to agree to this, Jack?

36:27.790 --> 36:30.463
She hasn't let us down yet. Rhys, okay?

36:38.230 --> 36:40.824

Two miles to the south,

40:08.470 --> 40:10.188
there's a warehouse area in Battersea.

why the operation is happening

40:26.790 --> 40:29.065
and to encourage participation.

40:29.390 --> 40:31.858
So the suggestion is
we announce that the children

40:31.950 --> 40:34.623
will be given some kind of inoculation,

40:35.230 --> 40:37.869

that everyone will be seen
in due course.

There's a saying here on Earth.

46:32.830 --> 46:36.106
A very old, very wise friend of mine
taught me it.

46:37.430 --> 46:40.308
An injury to one is an injury to all.

46:40.870 --> 46:44.306
And when people act according
to that philosophy,

46:44.390 --> 46:47.063
the human race is
the finest species in the universe.

46:47.150 --> 46:49.106
Never mind the philosophy.

46:49.190 --> 46:50.782
What he's saying is

46:50.870 --> 46:53.862
you're not getting one solitary,
single child.

46:54.830 --> 46:56.422
The deal is off.

46:57.190 --> 46:59.658
-Uh, I like the philosophy.
-I gathered.

46:59.750 --> 47:02.218
<i>You yielded in the past.</i>

47:03.270 --> 47:05.659
<i>You will do so again.</i>

47:05.910 --> 47:08.504
In the past, the numbers were
so small they could be kept secret.

47:08.590 --> 47:11.423
But this time,
that is not going to happen.

47:11.990 --> 47:14.424
<i>Because we've recorded everything.</i>

47:14.870 --> 47:16.667
<i>All the negotiations,</i>

47:17.030 --> 47:20.261
<i>everything the politicians said,</i>
<i>everything that happened in this room,</i>

47:20.350 --> 47:23.387
<i>and those tapes will be released</i>
<i>to the public.</i>

47:26.190 --> 47:28.829
Unless you leave this planet for good.

47:30.230 --> 47:32.585
<i>You yielded in the past.</i>

47:33.150 --> 47:35.220
<i>You will do so again.</i>

47:35.470 --> 47:37.108
When people find out the truth,

47:37.190 --> 47:40.387
you will have over six billion
angry human beings

47:40.470 --> 47:42.620
taking up arms to fight you.

47:43.710 --> 47:46.588
That might be a fight
you think you can win,

47:47.270 --> 47:49.067
