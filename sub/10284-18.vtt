Previously on E.R....

00:04.407 --> 00:06.321
Neela, I want you to say hi
to Mae Lee Park.

00:06.333 --> 00:08.657
- She's our new surgical med student.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

00:08.677 --> 00:11.577
- I so appreciate you taking time.
- Oh, it's my pleasure.

00:11.585 --> 00:13.220
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're not getting married.

00:13.233 --> 00:15.590
- If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.
- The wedding is on.

00:15.607 --> 00:17.659
What am I supposed to do?
"Hey, can I have some of your DNA?

00:17.677 --> 00:20.033
I want to find out if I'm your father."
What if I'm not?

00:20.067 --> 00:23.708
- I'm going to send Alex away.
- Mom, I don't want to stay here.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.230
Mom, please.

00:26.684 --> 00:28.633
Mom, I'll be better, okay?

00:28.667 --> 00:30.273
Neela...

00:39.674 --> 00:42.962
- No, no, I'm not buying that silly excuse.
- 35, 22, 14. 62...

00:43.179 --> 00:46.672
You've been cleaning the room for three
hours. My patient needs a tele bed right now.

00:46.705 --> 00:48.501
- You hear me?
- 35...

00:48.538 --> 00:50.180
- Hello?
- 21...

00:50.205 --> 00:51.833
Hey, what the hell is wrong
with the phones?

00:51.858 --> 00:55.631
85-- they're working on them today.
33, 4, 15, 16, 23, 42...

00:55.876 --> 00:59.241
- Pratt, here's your new medical student.
- What new medical student?

00:59.258 --> 01:02.400
- Larry Weston. Third year UIC.
- Yeah, why wasn't I told about this?

01:02.427 --> 01:05.393
- I'm telling you now.
- Great, great.

01:05.407 --> 01:08.453
- Look, Barry, I...
- That's, uh, Larry. It's fine.

01:08.478 --> 01:10.513
Yeah, I'm sorry about that, man.
Look, I didn't know you were coming,

01:10.537 --> 01:12.473
and I'm getting off pretty soon,
so Morris, he's gonna...

01:12.485 --> 01:15.942
Uh-uh, don't look at me.
41, 21, 55...

01:15.956 --> 01:17.740
You know what, there's
a Dr. Gates working today.

01:17.776 --> 01:19.430
You find him and tell him
that Dr. Pratt said

01:19.447 --> 01:20.943
that you're going
to be shadowing him all day.

01:20.975 --> 01:22.881
- Dr. Gates?
- That's right. You can't miss him.

01:22.905 --> 01:24.983
Swarthy kind of guy,
always has his hands in his pockets.

01:25.007 --> 01:26.411
- Got it.
- Great.

01:26.736 --> 01:28.302
I always knew you had a cruel streak.

01:28.315 --> 01:31.561
Hey, Pratt, can you sign off
on my thumb versus table saw guy?

01:31.575 --> 01:33.701
Thanks.
Anyone know who's on surgical call?

01:33.717 --> 01:36.051
- 15-- I think Neela is, why?
- Hey, guys.

01:36.078 --> 01:37.670
- It's Sam's birthday.
- No reason.

01:37.707 --> 01:40.581
Drinks at Ike's later.
And everybody has to sign her card.

01:40.607 --> 01:42.063
Please, could you find a bigger card?

01:42.276 --> 01:44.920
Despite what you've been told,
Ray, size does matter.

01:44.945 --> 01:47.192
I'm going to get coffees.
Anybody want one?

01:47.525 --> 01:49.900
- No. No. - No, it's cool.
- I'm good.

01:50.568 --> 01:53.932
- You okay, Frank?
- Oh, my back's a little stiff.

01:54.426 --> 01:56.223
- It's fine.
- Okay.

01:56.247 --> 01:58.803
24, 16, 69...

01:58.977 --> 02:01.891
- Morris, what are you doing?
- Oh, it's a well-known medical axiom.

02:01.917 --> 02:05.953
If the ages of all the patients in the ER
add up to 1,000, you can go home.

02:06.007 --> 02:07.981
- So far I'm up to 781.
- Is that for real?

02:08.007 --> 02:11.271
I heard your shift is over when
you treat a pirate and his parrot.

02:11.387 --> 02:13.823
All right, look, look, nobody's
going anywhere unless I say so.

02:13.838 --> 02:16.292
And I say, Ray,
infected tummy tuck in Two.

02:16.506 --> 02:19.252
Morris, we got a rig pulling in any minute.
And you can go out and...

02:19.487 --> 02:23.071
- calculate that.
- 25, 29, 81...

02:23.358 --> 02:26.341
Knuckleheads.
I'm surrounded by knuckleheads.

02:30.366 --> 02:31.602
Hey.

02:31.805 --> 02:34.373
Hey, Luka. Sorry.
I really need this.

02:34.436 --> 02:37.090
- Long night last night?
- Sam, can you give me a hand?

02:37.108 --> 02:38.891
Yeah, sure.

02:39.138 --> 02:43.203
Don't worry, your caffeine fix will be
waiting for you at the admit desk.

02:44.585 --> 02:47.511
- Hey... Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Luka.

02:47.536 --> 02:49.543
Alfred Gower, 63.
Blocked G-tube.

02:49.578 --> 02:51.900
Under hospice care for end-stage esophageal cancer.

02:51.938 --> 02:54.671
- Hospice? Why is he here?
- It's a G-tube.

02:54.687 --> 02:56.670
It's a comfort measure.

02:57.436 --> 02:59.481
- What the hell?
- Been at it ever since we picked him up.

02:59.506 --> 03:01.350
Ma'am, you need to stop that.

03:01.557 --> 03:04.011
Hey, I hear we're going out
for drinks after for your birthday.

03:04.037 --> 03:05.773
Oh, no, it's not a big deal.
We don't have to.

03:05.805 --> 03:07.642
You know what, lady,
you're gonna have to knock it off.

03:07.677 --> 03:09.421
I'm gonna rip that camera
right out of your hand.

03:09.435 --> 03:11.513
It's okay, miss.
She's with me.

03:11.837 --> 03:13.492
You know what, I really
don't care, you're in our way.

03:13.505 --> 03:16.832
Come on, I'm authorized. Come on,
smile for the camera, birthday girl.

03:16.976 --> 03:18.473
Hey! Knock it off!

03:29.025 --> 03:32.593
- Can I help you with something, Morris?
- No, but I can help you with one word.

03:32.607 --> 03:34.493
- Las Vegas.
- Pardon?

03:34.518 --> 03:38.092
Okay, two words. It is the hot
venue for destination weddings.

03:38.115 --> 03:40.113
- What? How did you...?
- No, no, no, don't- don't worry.

03:40.177 --> 03:42.943
I've been sworn to secrecy.
So...

03:43.388 --> 03:47.810
Las Vegas.
It has glitz, glamour, Celine Dion...

03:47.836 --> 03:50.251
Abby and I are not exactly
the glitz and glamour type.

03:50.276 --> 03:52.032
Well, there are plenty
of cultural things to do, too.

03:52.076 --> 03:54.122
The Hoover Dam, Liberace Museum...

03:54.135 --> 03:57.531
- Nudes on Ice, page 48.
- Morris, I'm not talking about this.

03:57.555 --> 03:59.813
And if I were you, I wouldn't mention
it to Abby either, okay?

03:59.835 --> 04:03.280
What about for your bachelor party?
Did I mention the brothels in Nevada?

04:03.308 --> 04:05.522
- They're legal!
- What's legal?

04:05.797 --> 04:09.161
- Uh... cockfighting in Louisiana.
- Good to know.

04:11.505 --> 04:13.161
- You all right?
- I'm great. I'm great.

04:13.178 --> 04:16.269
And I'd love to have this chat, but I think I hear Frank calling me.

04:16.286 --> 04:18.762
Yep, there it is...
Frank, what's up?

04:19.827 --> 04:24.700
Uh, hello.
I'm Doctor... Lockhart.

04:24.736 --> 04:27.890
- Uh, so you fainted at the, uh...
- Sun n' Go.

04:27.907 --> 04:31.603
- I was waiting for a tanning bed when...
- She passed out. It was awful.

04:31.625 --> 04:34.673
- Did you have breakfast?
- Mm-hmm. Diet soda and two saltines.

04:34.917 --> 04:36.861
Well, that doesn't really
sound like breakfast.

04:36.906 --> 04:39.400
We're gonna be tan and thin
for spring break if it kills us.

04:39.437 --> 04:41.111
- Yeah.
- Well, you're on your way.

04:41.125 --> 04:44.141
Hey, Sam, can I get two liters
of saline and a chem panel?

04:44.157 --> 04:47.293
Mm-hmm, sure. Wow.
That's some color you guys got there.

04:47.307 --> 04:48.411
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:48.827 --> 04:51.383
You know, tanning puts you
at serious risk for cancer.

04:51.406 --> 04:53.512
Ever think about a self-tanner
or spray-on tans?

04:53.536 --> 04:56.010
Yeah, you don't want to have skin like
leather when you're in your 40s.

04:56.077 --> 04:58.683
We're still at an age
where we care how we look.

04:59.615 --> 05:00.692
Okay.

05:00.968 --> 05:04.972
Uh... we're gonna need to keep you
here while we wait for you labs.

05:05.277 --> 05:06.422
Ouch.

05:06.758 --> 05:10.253
I cannot believe we just got dissed
by those walking raisins.

05:10.278 --> 05:12.661
I hope it rains every day
on spring break.

05:12.878 --> 05:15.593
- Oh, happy birthday, by the way.
- Thanks.

05:17.628 --> 05:20.681
Hey, Mr. Gower, we got
a new G-tube in your size.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.453
You can't unclog it?

05:22.746 --> 05:25.792
They tried flushing it, but it didn't work,
so doctor's gonna have to replace it.

05:25.817 --> 05:29.721
Let's forget about the G-tube. I'll buy
us all a steak and a bottle of Cabernet.

05:29.748 --> 05:33.971
That's tempting, but how about I get you
a pureed meal and an Ensure chaser?

05:34.205 --> 05:36.612
Somehow that doesn't quite make it.

05:39.298 --> 05:42.623
Uh... I didn't get a chance before.
My name is Diana Moore.

05:42.648 --> 05:45.443
Hi. Sam Taggart.
Listen, about earlier...

05:45.477 --> 05:46.962
Don't worry about it, no problem.

05:47.008 --> 05:49.162
Uh, no, I wanted to say that

05:49.178 --> 05:52.082
even if you are authorized, you can't
get in the way of us doing our job.

05:52.375 --> 05:54.673
Um, okay, won't happen again.

05:55.176 --> 05:57.940
Don't blame Diana,
she's dedicated to her work.

05:58.158 --> 06:02.382
- What is that, patient paparazzi?
- Yeah, actually. I'm...

06:02.446 --> 06:05.172
documenting hospice patients
through their deaths.

06:05.637 --> 06:07.843
But I keep mucking it up
by continuing to breathe.

06:07.875 --> 06:09.383
It's all about you, isn't it?

06:09.585 --> 06:13.521
Look, I got to hang around long enough to
convince her to run away with me to Cabo.

06:13.536 --> 06:16.261
- And I'm holding out for Maui.
- Okay, Maui.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.441
- Okay then.
- Sam...

06:18.738 --> 06:21.931
do you have someplace I could stash
my stuff and maybe upload some photos?

06:21.976 --> 06:23.901
You know what, let me check.
I'll be back.

06:25.047 --> 06:28.443
Hey, Frank.
Can I get a pureed meal for trauma one?

06:28.478 --> 06:32.522
- You're asking me because...?
- Make it mashed potatoes and turkey.

06:32.578 --> 06:35.600
- Somebody's getting bossy in her old age.
- I'm only 28.

06:35.637 --> 06:39.350
Yeah, well, live it up while you can.
You're about to hit the big 3-0.

06:39.376 --> 06:43.622
I'm not afraid of turning 30.
Morris, I got the G-tube for Mr. Gower.

06:43.658 --> 06:46.080
Well, I think you should be.
That's when gravity takes over

06:46.176 --> 06:48.390
and everything north
of the equator turns south.

06:48.405 --> 06:50.460
- What?
- He means you got a very small window

06:50.474 --> 06:52.323
before you go from "Miss" to "Ma'am,"

06:52.337 --> 06:56.333
skinny jeans to relaxed fit, blonde
highlights to little black chin hairs.

06:56.604 --> 06:58.382
- Oh, that's so wrong.
- No, really...

06:58.409 --> 07:00.890
Larry, I realize you're a smart guy,
and I know Pratt assigned you to me,

07:00.908 --> 07:03.892
- but I do my best work alone.
- But I really want to learn.

07:03.905 --> 07:05.302
Categorize the charts here.

07:05.385 --> 07:07.602
- You want it by patient name, arrival time...?
- Surprise me.

07:07.825 --> 07:09.772
Hey, Frank, you know anything
about Bluetooth technology?

07:09.806 --> 07:12.112
- What the hell is a Bluetooth?
- I'll take that as a "no."

07:12.137 --> 07:15.633
It's my little thing that's broken.
I can't dictate my notes into it.

07:15.676 --> 07:17.363
Get a secretary.

07:31.275 --> 07:35.410
- Oh. Hi. Getting coffee.
- Hey. Uh... tea.

07:36.416 --> 07:38.103
Excuse me.

07:40.368 --> 07:43.992
- Honey?
- Yeah. What? Um... sorry.

07:44.058 --> 07:45.590
Here.

07:47.635 --> 07:48.943
- You busy?
- Very.

07:48.977 --> 07:51.770
- How long you been working on the project?
- About a year.

07:51.867 --> 07:53.741
- I'm going to go.
- Me, too.

07:53.995 --> 07:56.000
And you don't find it a tad morbid?

07:56.037 --> 07:59.081
Well, yeah, I mean,
it's been known to stop

07:59.105 --> 08:02.213
a few conversations
at cocktail parties, but...

08:02.895 --> 08:06.651
I'm not really just documenting
the end of somebody's existence,

08:06.678 --> 08:09.802
I'm telling the story of people's
lives rich with history,

08:09.825 --> 08:13.761
- engaged in the struggle to survive.
- But don't they ever want to let go?

08:13.775 --> 08:16.332
Yeah.
Sometimes.

08:18.177 --> 08:21.201
Could be beautiful, too.
You know?

08:21.916 --> 08:23.983
Seen a lot of dying in my life.

08:24.467 --> 08:26.461
Just made me want to live more.

08:27.978 --> 08:29.402
What do you mean a lot of dying?

08:29.438 --> 08:33.660
Well, name a war or civil unrest since
1984, I've been there, covered it--

08:33.674 --> 08:37.131
Somalia, Chechnya,
Tiananmen Square, Iraq.

08:37.345 --> 08:39.763
I can see why
you're a big hit at parties.

08:40.736 --> 08:42.760
Mm, yeah, well...

08:43.017 --> 08:45.932
You know what, when their eyes start
to glaze over, I trot out the stories

08:46.005 --> 08:49.353
of the famous fashion photographer I worked
with in Paris right out of high school.

08:49.375 --> 08:53.153
Paris?
Wow, I always wanted to see Paris.

08:53.996 --> 08:58.490
18... no responsibilities...
nothing to tie me down.

08:59.936 --> 09:02.890
- You know what I mean?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

09:02.906 --> 09:05.672
Then I went through, like, this, like,
avant-garde stint for awhile

09:05.695 --> 09:08.583
that didn't pay the rent,
so I tried nature photography.

09:09.045 --> 09:13.292
Think models have attitude?
Try working with a moose.

09:15.388 --> 09:19.032
- It's an exciting life.
- Grass isn't always greener.

09:21.868 --> 09:24.730
- You like photography?
- Oh, no, please.

09:24.767 --> 09:28.233
I'm lucky if I don't put my finger over
the lens on the disposable camera.

09:30.308 --> 09:33.051
I got to go.
Use the room for as long as you want.

09:33.335 --> 09:36.873
- Excuse me! Coming through.
- Hey, what do you guys got?

09:37.007 --> 09:40.592
Uh, Derek Marchak, 32, driver of
a jackknifed truck on the Dan Ryan.

09:40.607 --> 09:41.610
My wife! Where's Mary?!

09:41.638 --> 09:44.212
- Good vitals, deep lacs, abdominal pain.
- We'll call her as soon as we can, sir.

09:44.226 --> 09:45.802
No, no, she's with me.
She always rides with me.

09:45.828 --> 09:48.420
They were cutting her out when we left. It's
gonna be awhile. Truck was mangled pretty bad.

09:48.436 --> 09:50.241
- I got to go to her!
- No, no, no.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.933
As soon as we find her, we'll let
you know. Okay? I promise.

09:54.035 --> 09:58.113
Corey Hales, semi versus compact,
sheared the roof right off the car.

09:58.316 --> 10:02.192
- Tachy to 132, systolic 74, sat 94.
- Was he conscious on the scene?

10:02.208 --> 10:05.870
Went apneic in the rig, GCS 7.
Vincent Hales, restrained driver.

10:05.957 --> 10:07.633
Corey, Daddy's here.
Hang in there, buddy.

10:07.645 --> 10:09.873
- Why isn't he boarded and collared?
- Refused at the scene,

10:09.978 --> 10:11.872
- wanted to be with his boy.
- Not acceptable.

10:11.908 --> 10:13.772
He was walking
and talking with good vitals.

10:13.806 --> 10:15.471
His son was crashing,
I wasn't about to argue.

10:15.486 --> 10:17.603
- He's gonna be okay, right?
- Sats down to 83.

10:17.628 --> 10:18.942
Okay, let's move it!

10:19.185 --> 10:21.173
Lungs clear, breath sounds are equal.

10:21.276 --> 10:24.813
- Let them know we moved Mr. Gower.
- Belly soft, stable pelvis.

10:24.838 --> 10:28.331
- I'll get his arm for you.
- CBC, trauma panel, type and cross.

10:28.515 --> 10:30.192
- Got a flash.
- What happened, man?

10:30.295 --> 10:32.172
I don't know, it was all so fast.

10:32.208 --> 10:34.702
Okay, we need a tox screen,
an EtOH level as well.

10:34.735 --> 10:36.802
- Hey.
- Hey, Mayday.

10:38.206 --> 10:40.572
I, uh, I got a page.
I'm Dr. Rasgotra from surgery.

10:40.588 --> 10:42.340
- Does anything hurt?
- Not really.

10:42.376 --> 10:45.003
- My wife-- did they bring in my wife?
- Just relax, let us work on this.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.040
I'll find out for you.

10:46.077 --> 10:48.381
Alert and oriented. Vitals good,
just need surgery to sign off.

10:48.458 --> 10:51.222
Lower extremities clear, no step off's,
no deformities.

10:51.248 --> 10:55.600
- Some nasty knee surgeries?
- Medial meniscus, ACL, anything?

10:55.648 --> 10:58.453
Both. Old war wounds.
Football.

10:58.675 --> 11:01.173
- Oh, yeah, where'd you play?
- Bunch of places--

11:01.206 --> 11:03.871
Indiana, Ohio...
I was pretty good for awhile.

11:03.908 --> 11:05.423
Can I get you to sign this real quick?

11:05.477 --> 11:08.102
- What is it?
- Consent to treatment.

11:09.405 --> 11:11.890
We need you to sign before
we can do any labs or tests.

11:13.315 --> 11:15.212
Where it says "patient signature."

11:16.856 --> 11:18.822
He may have hit his head harder
than we thought.

11:18.877 --> 11:21.353
All right, better get a scan.
Sam, call CT.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.140
Good mechanism for ICH, right?

11:23.175 --> 11:25.411
Yeah, car crashes are
a leading cause of TBI.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.291
- Phone's out.
- Irrigation tray,

11:27.305 --> 11:29.963
- four by fours and sterile saline.
- Do you see the cords or not?

11:30.885 --> 11:31.963
SAT's only 81.

11:32.008 --> 11:33.532
- Stop and bag him up.
- Does your phone work?

11:33.557 --> 11:37.202
- No, I got it, I'm in.
- Are you in pain, Mr. Hales?

11:37.235 --> 11:40.362
Someone take him to Exam Three.
Get a C-collar on him and

11:40.375 --> 11:42.693
- have a resident check him out.
- No, no, I'm staying with my son.

11:42.705 --> 11:45.262
- Chuny, call for a vent.
- No, she needs access first.

11:45.307 --> 11:47.451
His pressure's too low.
He's too clamped down.

11:47.475 --> 11:50.011
We were driving back from Ohio.
Went to see my parents.

11:50.046 --> 11:52.430
Okay, IO going in to the left tibia.

11:52.477 --> 11:57.093
Run a liter of NS through the IO.
Place another one on the other side.

11:57.355 --> 12:00.071
- I'll do a subclavian.
- BP's 76/24.

12:00.276 --> 12:02.253
- What's that mean?
- His pressure's too low.

12:02.308 --> 12:05.680
- He might be bleeding internally.
- Hey, Sam, is Neela next door?

12:05.796 --> 12:08.232
- Yeah.
- Can you please ask her to come in here?

12:08.336 --> 12:10.241
I've got a stab wound
to the neck in triage.

12:10.275 --> 12:13.101
- I can't find anybody in a white coat.
- Pratt, you go.

12:13.436 --> 12:14.670
Pulse is in the 140's.

12:14.687 --> 12:17.901
First unit's almost in.
Hanging O-neg in the other IO.

12:17.935 --> 12:19.493
Damn, I can't get a flash.

12:19.816 --> 12:22.822
Heard you had a hypotensive kid in here with
no good access. Should I put in a femoral?

12:22.836 --> 12:23.982
Yeah, go ahead.

12:25.045 --> 12:28.952
- Hey, I saw him after the accident.
- 18 gauge and cordis introducer.

12:29.127 --> 12:31.470
He was driving the truck, wasn't he?

12:31.507 --> 12:34.130
- He's the one who caused this.
- We don't know that, sir.

12:34.176 --> 12:35.180
Hey, you!

12:36.005 --> 12:38.613
I'm talking to you.
Look what you did to my son!

12:38.676 --> 12:40.170
Mr. Hales, you need to calm down.

12:40.198 --> 12:41.930
- And you killed them!
- Is that kid going to be all right?

12:41.976 --> 12:44.791
- You killed my wife and daughter!
- If you don't control yourself...

12:44.805 --> 12:48.701
- What he's saying, is it true? Did I do that?
- What am I supposed to do?

12:49.157 --> 12:51.491
You killed my wife and daughter.

12:59.616 --> 13:02.200
- How much in so far?
- Almost three liters.

13:02.378 --> 13:06.342
- Vitals?
- Pulse is 138, BP 75/29.

13:06.378 --> 13:09.530
- It's okay, son. You're doing great.
- Fluid's not touching him.

13:09.715 --> 13:11.763
That's because it's not getting into his circulation.

13:11.776 --> 13:14.892
- S.I. joint disruption.
- Pelvis fracture. I'll get the T-pod.

13:14.906 --> 13:17.153
All the fluid we're running
into his lower extremities

13:17.175 --> 13:20.273
- is pouring directly into the fracture.
- He needs access above the break.

13:20.308 --> 13:22.860
- How do I get this thing on?
- I'll show you.

13:23.615 --> 13:26.840
- Mae Lee.
- Dr. Dubenko sent me to observe.

13:26.908 --> 13:28.230
You can do an IO up there?

13:28.278 --> 13:31.202
It's a little trickier to get the position
right, but, yeah, you can.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.090
- 200 mikes per kilo of factor 7-A.
- I'm in.

13:34.205 --> 13:35.991
Running the blood up here.

13:36.326 --> 13:39.252
He should go upstairs for angio,
and then maybe the OR.

13:39.438 --> 13:42.660
- You mean an operation?
- Perhaps. But he should be okay.

13:43.288 --> 13:46.093
You hear that, buddy?
It's all good.

13:49.655 --> 13:51.181
CT results.

13:52.607 --> 13:54.482
We got word on your wife.
She's being choppered in.

13:54.507 --> 13:56.723
- She'll be here soon.
- Did they say how she is?

13:56.758 --> 13:59.470
- Uh, no, but I'll get an update.
- Thanks.

13:59.725 --> 14:03.290
Well, good news. Your neck is fine and
your brain looks normal and healthy.

14:03.316 --> 14:04.811
Yeah, I bet.

14:05.725 --> 14:08.903
If I wasn't so damn stupid, my wife
wouldn't be coming here by chopper,

14:09.276 --> 14:12.340
- the kids wouldn't be hurt.
- You need to be observed overnight.

14:12.406 --> 14:14.782
We'll keep you down here
till we find you a bed.

14:16.868 --> 14:19.092
You should rest now, Mr. Marchak. Okay?

14:21.208 --> 14:23.961
So, birthday girl, you been your sexy on

14:24.005 --> 14:26.582
now that Alex is away
at the fancy boarding school?

14:26.646 --> 14:28.390
It's not fancy, Morris.

14:28.556 --> 14:30.672
I sent my kid there
because he needs help.

14:30.685 --> 14:32.292
More than I can give him.

14:32.315 --> 14:33.890
Of course. I'm sorry.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.390
Yeah, but now I feel like
I might have made mistake.

14:37.418 --> 14:40.491
I've been e-mailing him, calling him,
but he's ignoring me.

14:40.505 --> 14:43.190
No, no, no, you did the right thing.
Alex needed help.

14:43.398 --> 14:45.802
It might take him some time
to adjust, but...

14:45.867 --> 14:47.992
don't worry, everything's going
to turn out fine.

14:48.078 --> 14:49.481
I hope so.

14:49.688 --> 14:52.953
Hey, Frank, any updates on the chopper
with the trucker's wife?

14:53.005 --> 14:54.763
- Negative.
- Any calls for me?

14:54.808 --> 14:56.301
Double negative.

14:57.807 --> 15:02.001
Hey, Abby, awesome save
on that boy today.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.911
Thank you, Hope.
You were a big help.

15:04.347 --> 15:10.331
So, um, there's something I'd like to
talk to you about if you have a minute?

15:10.346 --> 15:13.213
I don't really right now,
but maybe later?

15:13.408 --> 15:17.011
- Sure, no problem.
- Yeah, Alex Taggart.

15:17.205 --> 15:19.763
- Has he gotten any of my messages?
- Sam, my pancreatitis guy

15:19.805 --> 15:22.733
needs orthostatics, an NG tube,
and a repeat blood gas.

15:22.807 --> 15:24.870
And give the results to Kovac,
I'm out of here.

15:25.076 --> 15:27.103
Will you just tell him
that his mother called again?

15:27.177 --> 15:29.451
Thank you.
What's this?

15:29.478 --> 15:32.893
Oh, no, Sam, you don't have to...

15:33.077 --> 15:36.183
"Te don'ts before you say "I Do"."

15:36.215 --> 15:39.931
"Taffeta or tulle, it's up to you."

15:41.118 --> 15:45.612
- You getting married?
- Me? No. It's just...

15:45.678 --> 15:50.053
This is wedding research
that I've collected over the years.

15:50.306 --> 15:53.072
It weighs a ton.
How long you been doing research?

15:53.315 --> 15:56.400
- Since I was ten.
- Ten? What's it doing here?

15:57.008 --> 16:02.920
Well, someone I know is getting married,
and I thought she might like to borrow it

16:02.945 --> 16:05.943
without getting angry or hurting me.

16:06.427 --> 16:09.500
I would have no idea how to plan a wedding,
if and when that ever happens to me.

16:09.525 --> 16:13.290
Weddings are wonderful
and they're magical, and...

16:15.708 --> 16:18.083
Oops. So sorry.

16:19.586 --> 16:28.030
Well, I would be honored... Sam,
to help you when your day comes.

16:29.967 --> 16:31.053
Thanks.

16:31.645 --> 16:35.131
Wow, Tony, I can't believe
you let me do a paracentesis.

16:35.445 --> 16:38.160
Well, Larry, my philosophy is 90%
of learning is doing.

16:38.208 --> 16:42.063
I was wondering, though-- as
an intern, don't you need supervision?

16:42.565 --> 16:44.990
You know, let's just keep that
between you and me, okay?

16:45.036 --> 16:48.303
Nobody really needs to know about it.
People like Kovac, Pratt.

16:48.336 --> 16:50.532
- Yeah, got it, got it.
- Hey, Neela.

16:50.947 --> 16:53.780
Why don't you go check on the charts.
You know, double check them,

16:53.805 --> 16:55.853
- be thorough. It'll be fun, okay?
- Yeah, cool, cool.

16:56.525 --> 16:58.112
- Need help?
- Thanks, but we're...

16:58.135 --> 17:01.123
I've got it, Neela.
Lucien wants you to stay down here.

17:01.637 --> 17:03.401
Lucien does?

17:07.936 --> 17:09.903
- How are things?
- Good.

17:10.017 --> 17:12.201
Sarah spent the weekend with
her grandparents, which is good--

17:12.228 --> 17:14.960
to gave me time to think
about everything, you know?

17:16.238 --> 17:19.032
I'm going to talk to her
about what Meg said and the

17:19.146 --> 17:22.772
- whole paternity test thing.
- Any idea how she'll take it?

17:22.807 --> 17:25.619
I don't know, I'm still having
a hard time with it myself.

17:27.907 --> 17:29.130
I mean, if there's anything
I can do...

17:29.176 --> 17:31.231
I don't want to put you in
an awkward position.

17:31.305 --> 17:34.591
- No, I know, but if I can help...
- I don't want you to feel

17:34.657 --> 17:37.531
like you have to do anything more than you want to do...

17:37.547 --> 17:40.212
I know, but... I mean...
Actually, you know...

17:42.607 --> 17:44.533
I just don't know how I fit in.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.103
I understand.
I totally understand.

17:47.248 --> 17:50.433
- I'll keep you posted.
- Okay. - Bye.

17:52.778 --> 17:55.971
Unrestrained passenger.
Prolonged extraction.

17:56.015 --> 17:57.490
- Blunt trauma to chest.
- Abby.

17:57.515 --> 18:00.360
Hypotensive,
hypoxic with respiratory distress.

18:00.395 --> 18:02.462
- Okay, Trauma Two.
- Updated vitals?

18:02.475 --> 18:07.181
- BP 90 palp, pulse 120, 89% sats.
- The Expressway crash?

18:07.198 --> 18:09.891
- Is this Mary Marchak?
- She needs an airway.

18:11.385 --> 18:14.122
Seven and a half ET tube
with a scope and a curved blade.

18:14.148 --> 18:16.911
Paradoxical chest movement on the left.

18:17.108 --> 18:20.772
Pulse is thready. Flail chest.
20 etomidate, 120 SUX.

18:20.896 --> 18:24.021
- Pupils equal and reactive.
- You're okay.

18:24.358 --> 18:26.841
O2 sat 86%.

18:27.125 --> 18:31.121
CBC, trauma panel, foley, chest,
pelvis and C-spine films.

18:31.136 --> 18:33.012
- How long have you had that?
- Didn't know you cared, Lockhart.

18:33.116 --> 18:34.170
- Drugs are in.
- I don't.

18:34.206 --> 18:37.393
- Find my later and I'll check it out.
- Have fun, kids.

18:41.158 --> 18:43.030
- The Medi-van's right outside.
- Oh, great,

18:43.105 --> 18:45.981
- 'cause he's really anxious to get home.
- He's a fighter.

18:46.185 --> 18:48.823
Well, doctor's gave him three weeks,
it's been three months.

18:49.038 --> 18:51.822
- He's also quite a character.
- Hmm, yeah.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.472
I just want to make sure he's set up
before I get my things.

18:54.648 --> 18:56.310
- I'll start packing it up for you.
- Thank you.

18:56.527 --> 18:59.380
Thank you, Ms. Taggart.
It's been a pleasure.

18:59.947 --> 19:01.271
Till we meet again.

19:07.446 --> 19:09.950
- Cordis introducer.
- Spleen looks good.

19:10.006 --> 19:11.472
Damn it!
Where's our blood?

19:11.505 --> 19:13.463
Blood bank says ten more minutes
for cross match.

19:13.665 --> 19:15.932
Fluid by the liver,
hemopneumothorax on the left...

19:16.008 --> 19:16.820
You need me?

19:16.877 --> 19:18.523
Yeah, not big enough to cause tamponade.

19:18.545 --> 19:21.472
- Crit 32%.
- Sterile 6's to me and Mae Lee.

19:22.157 --> 19:23.633
Second chest tube, and 10 blade.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.850
Neela, why don't you give the first one a chance to work.

19:25.875 --> 19:27.100
- There isn't time...
- We don't have room.

19:27.138 --> 19:28.712
Hey, hey, wait!

19:28.888 --> 19:31.810
There are too many people in here
and a full ER out there.

19:31.835 --> 19:33.601
- Abby, go clear the board.
- Morris...

19:33.635 --> 19:35.583
Pratt's shift is over
and Kovac is at a meeting.

19:35.607 --> 19:37.451
- Someone needs to push charts.
- Fine.

19:37.948 --> 19:40.451
Sam, find me a cell saver now, please!

19:42.858 --> 19:43.650
Please...

19:43.846 --> 19:45.890
What's going on? I can't see anything.
How's Mary?

19:45.907 --> 19:47.470
The doctor's are doing
everything they can.

19:47.505 --> 19:49.580
- But is she going to be okay?
- Found one.

19:49.608 --> 19:50.850
She has to be okay.

19:50.908 --> 19:53.832
Please, please, she's my whole life.

19:55.175 --> 19:57.583
- Mary? Honey, I'm right here.
- I found it.

19:57.608 --> 19:59.850
- You're going to be okay. Just hold on.
- Ray, set it up.

19:59.898 --> 20:02.481
If this doesn't work, we're going
to have to think about thoracotomy.

20:02.487 --> 20:04.823
For blunt trauma?
Survival's one in 400.

20:04.876 --> 20:07.882
That's because we don't usually
do it until after they arrest.

20:08.006 --> 20:10.103
Make the incision
in the anterior axillary line.

20:10.485 --> 20:11.930
BP 65.

20:12.005 --> 20:13.541
She could have a cardiac laceration.

20:13.576 --> 20:15.403
The scan showed minimal fluid
in the pericardium.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.122
Hold your hand on the clamp
so it doesn't go in too far.

20:18.147 --> 20:20.333
I can find it with my finger,
but can't get the tube in.

20:20.358 --> 20:22.233
Extend the incision.

20:22.677 --> 20:24.123
Like this.
Let me show you.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.952
- Scalpel.
- Heart rate's dropping.

20:27.006 --> 20:29.152
Hang another O-neg and
call the blood bank again.

20:30.336 --> 20:31.610
Sat's 82.

20:31.836 --> 20:34.240
Come on, Neela,
she's getting hard to bag.

20:34.317 --> 20:36.741
Get the Thora-Seal, Morris.
She's going to bleed out.

20:36.775 --> 20:38.893
She's getting blood.
Do the thoracotomy in the OR.

20:39.006 --> 20:42.120
- She's bradying down.
- Morris, she'll die before she gets there.

20:42.137 --> 20:44.662
- This is the only time we have.
- Okay, okay, you made your case.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.202
Thoracotomy tray.

20:47.408 --> 20:49.640
- Hey.
- Hey. How was your meeting?

20:49.675 --> 20:54.003
- Oh, long, boring, unnecessary.
- Sounds fun.

20:57.626 --> 21:00.502
- How would you feel about eloping?
- Eloping?

21:00.655 --> 21:04.081
- What brought that on?
- Morris knows we're getting married.

21:04.105 --> 21:07.671
- Oh, you know, I bet Hope told him.
- Hope knows?

21:09.268 --> 21:12.042
She's got this bizarre wedding ESP.

21:12.106 --> 21:16.142
Morris suggested we should get
married in Vegas with Celine Dion.

21:16.445 --> 21:19.081
Well, we need to shut them down
before they tell everybody.

21:19.118 --> 21:20.500
How do you do that?

21:20.987 --> 21:24.842
Beat them with a bag of oranges?
I hear it doesn't leave any marks.

21:25.655 --> 21:29.052
- Or we could just talk to them.
- That's... that's much better.

21:33.225 --> 21:34.562
- Hey, Lockhart.
- Hey.

21:35.557 --> 21:36.840
- Ready to play doctor?
- Yeah.

21:37.025 --> 21:39.312
Um, come on in here.

21:43.516 --> 21:46.422
- Unzip your flight suit.
- Usually I get dinner first...

21:46.455 --> 21:48.722
Quiet, or I'll give you a rectal
just for the hell of it.

21:48.777 --> 21:51.930
- Nice bedside manner.
- Did you get a flu shot?

22:04.807 --> 22:07.512
Good breath sounds.
A few crackles at the base.

22:07.546 --> 22:09.102
Any change in exercise tolerance?

22:09.206 --> 22:11.830
Yeah. I get a little short of breath
about halfway through a lap dance.

22:12.085 --> 22:13.813
Thanks for the visual.

22:14.116 --> 22:16.590
You know, I'm not much
for complaining, but, um...

22:17.017 --> 22:20.493
- What?
- Back in '01, after the towers fell,

22:20.516 --> 22:23.511
me and my buddies jumped in my truck.
We drove straight through to New York.

22:23.675 --> 22:27.741
We worked the pile for a couple weeks,
not that we found anyone alive.

22:28.706 --> 22:30.433
You think that's what caused this?

22:30.778 --> 22:36.662
Well, we kept working, breathing
in pulverized concrete, glass,

22:36.778 --> 22:40.391
dust particles laced with benzene,
dioxin, asbestos, lead...

22:41.176 --> 22:42.723
Were you wearing any protective gear?

22:42.775 --> 22:45.852
According to the government and the EPA,
we didn't need any.

22:46.246 --> 22:47.501
Always reliable.

22:47.585 --> 22:49.452
They got a name for it--
Trade Center Cough.

22:49.507 --> 22:51.232
Some of the guys got it.
They're sick--

22:51.537 --> 22:55.782
asthma, lymphoma, leukemia.
One of them died in January.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.742
Sorry.

22:59.178 --> 23:02.011
Pulse ox is okay, but it could be better.

23:02.108 --> 23:06.311
If I have something, or if I'm going
get something, I want to know.

23:07.476 --> 23:09.702
I'll order a chest X ray and some labs.

23:11.886 --> 23:15.511
This is just between us.
Even my wife doesn't know.

23:15.737 --> 23:17.653
And I don't want to be grounded
while they dick around

23:17.778 --> 23:21.672
- trying to prove a scientific link.
- Okay. I'm on till 8:00.

23:21.868 --> 23:24.400
- Probably have your results by then.
- Lockhart?

23:26.207 --> 23:27.500
I owe you.

23:28.247 --> 23:31.861
- Okay, here's some light.
- I see the pericardium.

23:31.965 --> 23:35.380
- Mayo scissors.
- Give two units FFP.

23:35.405 --> 23:39.130
2-O silk with pledget.
I feel a defect.

23:39.826 --> 23:42.301
- Surgery, what's the story?
- Blunt trauma, flail chest.

23:42.326 --> 23:45.483
Hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation
and transfusion.

23:45.507 --> 23:49.352
We hooked up the cell saver to recycle the
blood while I put in the second chest tube.

23:49.375 --> 23:51.660
- There was a small amount of fluid in the...
- Pericardium.

23:51.776 --> 23:55.390
And I thought maybe there was a ventricular
laceration from a fractured rib,

23:55.416 --> 23:57.672
so we decided to do a thoracotomy.

23:57.707 --> 24:01.193
There was a defect in the ventricle,
and now Neela's holding pressure on it.

24:01.216 --> 24:03.533
- Excellent, Mae Lee.
- Wait a minute. That is not ex...

24:03.578 --> 24:05.922
I'll take it from here. There's still a
couple of surgical consults in the ER.

24:05.976 --> 24:07.910
Why don't you go see to them?
I'll do the repair with Mae Lee.

24:08.005 --> 24:11.103
- Yeah, well, I've already...
- I've got it, Neela. I've got it.

24:12.627 --> 24:15.150
Okay, visualize the injury to see if...

24:45.497 --> 24:46.900
Self-portrait.

24:52.948 --> 24:55.381
Ovarian cancer, first time around.

24:56.977 --> 24:58.063
First?

24:58.507 --> 25:01.112
But they say the third time is the charm.

25:02.725 --> 25:05.590
- I'm sorry.
- I'm pissed off and annoyed.

25:05.755 --> 25:08.013
Are you in treatment now?

25:09.408 --> 25:11.032
Two more sessions.

25:12.016 --> 25:14.421
Least, this time, I didn't lose my hair.

25:14.907 --> 25:18.901
- Yeah. You look great.
- I feel fine.

25:19.295 --> 25:21.830
I felt fine when they first diagnosed me.

25:22.908 --> 25:25.881
Who knew a few days
bloating was stage four?

25:27.268 --> 25:30.042
Yeah. Unfortunately,
thehere's no reareliable screening tool.

25:30.057 --> 25:31.242
Yet.

25:32.065 --> 25:33.811
Just need money and research.

25:34.055 --> 25:37.531
We're still the poor stepchild of
the breast cancer publicity machine.

25:37.576 --> 25:39.351
All those pink ribbons.

25:39.468 --> 25:42.670
Do you know what color
is associated with ovarian cancer?

25:43.138 --> 25:44.683
Teal.

25:46.076 --> 25:48.792
I mean, what is that?
It's not blue, it's not green.

25:50.177 --> 25:54.870
I'm guessing that your illness has
something to do with your project.

25:56.966 --> 26:00.030
My cancer was my wake-up call.
It made me...

26:00.645 --> 26:04.442
more passionate about living, about
doing the things that make me happy.

26:06.246 --> 26:08.723
Not worrying about the stupid stuff.

26:13.177 --> 26:14.662
Happy birthday.

26:15.845 --> 26:18.502
What? No. What? No, no.

26:18.595 --> 26:20.962
- I can't... I can't take that.
- Yes, yes, yes, you can.

26:21.208 --> 26:23.612
Companies give me
free stuff all the time.

26:25.967 --> 26:27.210
Really?

26:37.628 --> 26:38.851
Thank you.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.331
Use it. It's fun.

26:42.405 --> 26:44.572
- Yeah.
- Point and shoot.

26:45.258 --> 26:47.661
Just remember to move your finger.

26:54.618 --> 26:57.022
- Odd place for a bee sting.
- Ah know. Ah din't...

26:57.576 --> 26:59.460
Best not to talk, okay?

26:59.577 --> 27:03.683
Half cc of one percent lido and epi. That
should make her tongue nice and numb.

27:03.778 --> 27:05.973
And... got it.

27:06.617 --> 27:08.580
You can suck on some Popsicles
until the swelling goes down.

27:08.605 --> 27:11.402
And, next time you go jogging, make
sure to keep your mouth closed, okay?

27:11.418 --> 27:13.313
- You get all that?
- I'll write it up right now,

27:13.336 --> 27:15.273
- and add it to the rest of your charts.
- Good. How's that going, by the way?

27:15.308 --> 27:17.930
All done.
Except, well, I...

27:18.005 --> 27:21.672
didn't want to mention it,
but I found several spelling errors.

27:21.776 --> 27:25.013
Oh. Well, you know that was just a test
to make sure you were paying attention.

27:25.106 --> 27:27.601
And you did very well.
Bravo, Larry. Bravo.

27:27.676 --> 27:31.111
Gates, I'm not your personal
answering service.

27:31.145 --> 27:35.463
Sorry. Gates. Uh... no,
there's no "Seymore Butts" here.

27:35.508 --> 27:37.503
Hello, Sarah.
Where are you?

27:41.578 --> 27:43.112
Grandma and Grandpa drop you off?

27:43.335 --> 27:46.740
Yeah. They say hi.
Look what I got.

27:46.808 --> 27:49.482
Wow! Fancy.
Who's going to pay for it?

27:49.516 --> 27:51.283
Grandma and Grandpa are paying for it.

27:51.308 --> 27:54.412
And they say that now they'll be able
to keep in touch with me better,

27:54.438 --> 27:57.162
and it's going to be really good
for emergencies 'cause I'll have it,

27:57.177 --> 27:59.271
- and then you'll be able to...
- All right. I'm sold. I'm sold.

27:59.448 --> 28:02.112
- But we're going set up some rules.
- Of course we are.

28:03.266 --> 28:04.441
Did you have a good time?

28:04.515 --> 28:08.280
Yeah. Grandpa let me ride ride Beauty.
She's the one that's completely jet black

28:08.315 --> 28:10.411
with a white spot
in the middle of her forehead.

28:10.458 --> 28:12.251
- Sounds like fun.
- Yeah.

28:12.998 --> 28:14.850
And they told me
all these stories about mom.

28:14.998 --> 28:19.160
Like, when she was my age, she took
Grandpa's car for a ride without asking.

28:19.205 --> 28:20.901
Yeah?
Well, don't get any ideas.

28:22.807 --> 28:26.280
Do you think maybe you'd like
to spend a little more time with them?

28:26.475 --> 28:27.663
Sure.

28:28.336 --> 28:33.760
Maybe, I don't know, you think
you might want to live with them?

28:34.476 --> 28:38.832
Well, I don't know. I mean, my school's
here, so I can't really do that.

28:38.906 --> 28:43.653
And all my friends are here.
You're here, too.

28:45.008 --> 28:48.332
I mean, why would I want to do that?

28:48.898 --> 28:52.753
Just asking. Come on.
Let's get my stuff, get out of here.

28:53.935 --> 28:55.201
V-fib.

28:55.678 --> 28:57.661
Charge the internal paddles.

28:57.976 --> 29:00.692
Tie the suture while
they prepare to defibrillate.

29:05.907 --> 29:07.213
Tie the knot.

29:11.665 --> 29:13.850
- Mae Lee, tie the knot.
- Charged!

29:14.006 --> 29:15.310
20 joules.

29:15.958 --> 29:17.980
Clear. Clear!

29:19.725 --> 29:21.653
Still no response.

29:23.588 --> 29:25.101
Mae Lee, tie the knot!

29:27.188 --> 29:28.822
- Get out of my way.
- Got it!

29:29.787 --> 29:31.812
Could be hypocalcemic
from massive transfusion.

29:31.848 --> 29:34.683
She's also hypoxic
from the pulmonary bleed. Clear!

29:39.018 --> 29:40.281
Still no pulse.

29:40.896 --> 29:43.101
She's in pump failure
from cardiac contusion.

29:43.137 --> 29:44.903
Resume internal compressions.

29:45.156 --> 29:47.072
- Oh, come on.
- V-fib again!

29:47.116 --> 29:49.793
I don't think we're going
to get her out of it this time.

29:50.148 --> 29:52.921
No, she's coagulopathic.
I can't stop the bleeding.

29:53.006 --> 29:55.333
- 30 joules.
- Okay, clear.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.552
Stop, stop, stop.
Stop it! Stop it!

30:03.608 --> 30:06.410
There's nothing more we can do.
Stop it. It's over. It's over.

30:08.556 --> 30:10.050
Call it, Ray.

30:10.718 --> 30:14.430
Okay. Time of death: 13:25.

30:17.426 --> 30:21.342
Repair of a cardiac laceration is way
beyond a fourth-year medical student.

30:21.358 --> 30:23.222
I did the repair.
Mae Lee put in one stitch.

30:23.255 --> 30:26.133
I was already there. I was in a much
better position to assist you.

30:26.176 --> 30:28.040
You're going to have to learn
to share the sandbox, Neela.

30:28.107 --> 30:30.393
Mae Lee's here for four weeks.
You've got four more years.

30:30.416 --> 30:32.730
- You'll get another chance.
- This isn't about the procedure.

30:32.805 --> 30:36.000
- Do you have a problem with me?
- Do I have a problem with you?

30:37.057 --> 30:39.583
Look, you're a very talented
surgeon, Neela, but...

30:39.798 --> 30:42.401
yeah, maybe I've let our personal
friendship get in the way

30:42.437 --> 30:45.653
- of our professional relationship, yeah.
- Well, how? What do you mean?

30:46.477 --> 30:49.481
I'm the chief, and you're an intern.
That's it.

30:50.126 --> 30:53.730
- Maybe I've sent off mixed signals.
- No, no. no. It seems very clear.

30:53.748 --> 30:56.590
You're angry with me, but I don't
understand why. Is this about Manish?

30:56.618 --> 30:59.562
I am not angry with you.
And this is not about Manish.

30:59.606 --> 31:02.973
I just... I just think it's time
we reset our dynamic.

31:03.006 --> 31:05.200
Reset? Are you going to reset
that dead woman in there?

31:05.217 --> 31:06.541
Reset her grieving husband?

31:06.576 --> 31:09.692
No. You can't take it personally
when a surgery doesn't go well,

31:09.718 --> 31:12.720
just as I can't make
surgical decisions based

31:12.747 --> 31:15.083
- Based on what?
- on my personal feelings towards you.

31:22.045 --> 31:25.800
Look, we both know that poor
woman didn't die because...

31:26.015 --> 31:29.030
Mae Lee was in there, and you weren't.
Her injuries were far too great.

31:29.116 --> 31:31.522
Nothing on this earth
could have saved her.

31:38.878 --> 31:40.232
Give it to me straight.

31:42.005 --> 31:43.702
Your blood work was normal.

31:43.908 --> 31:48.141
Your chest X rays were clear.
But there is some evidence of sinusitis.

31:48.175 --> 31:50.770
So here are your films
and your test results,

31:50.815 --> 31:53.033
plus a prescription for azithromycin

31:53.106 --> 31:55.481
and Pulmicort-- that's an inhaler.
It should help.

31:56.686 --> 31:59.591
- So I'm okay for now?
- Looks like it.

32:02.386 --> 32:03.902
This is a good thing.

32:04.116 --> 32:07.680
There's lots of other people worked
at Ground Zero, and at the landfills.

32:07.716 --> 32:10.362
I mean, how many of them
are walking time bombs?

32:11.057 --> 32:13.290
No good deed goes unpunished, I guess.

32:13.776 --> 32:16.991
- Maybe, next time, we'll be smarter.
- Maybe, now, you'll tell your wife.

32:17.288 --> 32:20.152
What? And give her more
ammo to nag me about?

32:22.017 --> 32:24.263
- Night, Lockhart.
- Good night.

32:28.005 --> 32:31.723
Someone from Social Work will be down
to help you with arrangements.

32:32.185 --> 32:34.032
Is there anyone we can call?

32:35.416 --> 32:38.701
No. It was just the two of us.

32:39.678 --> 32:41.532
We liked it like that.

32:42.676 --> 32:45.161
We never ran out of things
to say, even on...

32:45.366 --> 32:48.112
long stretches of road
that seemed to go on for days.

32:48.308 --> 32:51.573
Must be nice to spend that much time
with the person you love.

32:52.227 --> 32:54.953
Actually, she was the brains
behind everything.

32:55.875 --> 33:01.720
Did all the paperwork, paid the bills,
read the road maps.

33:01.925 --> 33:05.013
I can't tell you how many times
she kept us from getting lost.

33:08.016 --> 33:10.163
Today was going be different.

33:11.696 --> 33:14.581
- Different?
- Yeah.

33:16.037 --> 33:18.093
The rain makes her sleepy.

33:18.865 --> 33:21.161
So I told her to take a nap.

33:22.298 --> 33:25.031
I was sure I knew what exit to take.

33:26.818 --> 33:28.283
But the sign...

33:28.677 --> 33:30.563
wasn't the sign.

33:31.008 --> 33:33.213
I-I got confused.

33:33.836 --> 33:35.713
I didn't want to wake her up.

33:36.657 --> 33:38.790
I wanted to do it myself.

33:40.405 --> 33:41.623
Do what?

33:42.157 --> 33:43.682
Read.

33:44.495 --> 33:47.651
I wanted to read the damn exit sign.

33:49.276 --> 33:50.523
Derek, you...

33:51.175 --> 33:53.413
You don't know how to read?

33:58.375 --> 34:00.310
Mary was trying to teach me.

34:02.186 --> 34:05.302
You graduated high school
and went to college?

34:06.317 --> 34:08.561
They just passed me along.

34:09.607 --> 34:13.793
Nobody cared as long as I could read the
defense and get the ball in the end zone.

34:15.034 --> 34:17.870
Coaches said I was gonna
get drafted first round.

34:21.625 --> 34:24.522
I wasn't prepared for it not to work out.

34:31.326 --> 34:32.719
I'm sorry.

34:39.958 --> 34:42.440
I just wanted to make you proud.

34:45.465 --> 34:47.181
I'm sorry.

34:58.336 --> 35:00.971
Get... go that way.

35:06.836 --> 35:08.421
Sarah?

35:09.037 --> 35:11.530
I'll do the dishes
after I do my homework, okay?

35:11.577 --> 35:14.791
This isn't about the dishes.
Could you come back in here a sec?

35:15.235 --> 35:17.352
I need to talk you for a second.

35:20.798 --> 35:26.273
I've been trying to figure out a way to tell
you this, and if I should tell you this.

35:26.696 --> 35:27.931
What?

35:28.935 --> 35:31.050
The night that your mom died...

35:33.085 --> 35:34.540
she told me...

35:37.285 --> 35:39.063
that I'm your father.

35:42.468 --> 35:44.981
My dad's name was Keith.
He died.

35:45.008 --> 35:47.140
I know, I know.
We all thought...

35:48.105 --> 35:50.733
that your dad was Keith.
But, um...

35:51.825 --> 35:54.831
there's a chance that
that might not be true.

35:57.016 --> 35:58.822
But Mom didn't tell me.

35:59.167 --> 36:01.910
- Why wouldn't she tell me?
- I don't know, sweetie.

36:02.006 --> 36:04.061
She must have had her reasons.

36:06.058 --> 36:08.823
So... are you my dad or not?

36:09.176 --> 36:15.053
Well, there's a simple test we can take.
It's called a paternity test, and, um...

36:15.966 --> 36:17.433
if you want...

36:17.697 --> 36:19.511
we can take it tonight.

36:20.128 --> 36:22.471
Why are you doing this now?

36:22.576 --> 36:25.781
Is this just because I don't want to go
and live with Grandma and Grandpa?

36:25.807 --> 36:28.123
- Sarah, I just, I...
- You're just trying to get rid of me.

36:28.147 --> 36:31.491
- I just, I want what's best for you.
- No, you're lying!

36:31.526 --> 36:34.321
I know you're lying.
You're lying just like Mom!

36:34.375 --> 36:36.211
She always lied.

36:36.835 --> 36:38.732
- Sarah...
- No! Okay?!

36:38.938 --> 36:42.971
I don't want you to be my dad,
and I'm not taking your test!

36:44.387 --> 36:47.002
You know, Morris might have something.

36:48.386 --> 36:51.060
Maybe we should get married
someplace exotic.

36:51.177 --> 36:52.443
Like where?

36:52.885 --> 36:57.241
The beach... or the mountains.
Why don't we go to Croatia?

36:57.796 --> 36:58.982
Really?

36:59.227 --> 37:01.102
But no one from work
would be able to be there.

37:01.125 --> 37:03.590
Do it! Do it!
I'm gonna do it.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.440
Would that be so bad?

37:15.838 --> 37:17.941
Morris! Hope.

37:18.138 --> 37:20.971
- We need to talk to you.
- Who? Us?

37:21.035 --> 37:22.071
Look, listen.

37:22.177 --> 37:26.001
Abby and I really appreciate
your interest in our engagement.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.760
It's so exciting!
The wedding!

37:28.775 --> 37:29.800
Sorry.

37:29.897 --> 37:33.510
And while your planning
is very thoughtful...

37:33.728 --> 37:36.002
it's borderline obsessive.

37:36.335 --> 37:40.880
- Oh, we've been, we just want to help.
- Well, next time just... don't help.

37:41.718 --> 37:44.881
And don't blab. To anybody.
Not us, just, no one.

37:45.627 --> 37:46.681
Okay.

37:47.086 --> 37:49.382
- I mean, if that's what you want.
- We do!

37:50.015 --> 37:52.292
Hey, everybody!
Look who's here!

37:56.985 --> 38:00.861
- Look at everybody.
- Let's have a toast, Sam.

38:01.155 --> 38:06.343
To Sam!
Happy birthday and many more.

38:11.897 --> 38:13.111
B-10.

38:13.187 --> 38:16.452
You didn't actually mean to put in...
"Get Down Tonight"?

38:16.505 --> 38:18.000
I like KC and the Sunshine Band.

38:18.035 --> 38:20.341
Besides, it's a hell of a lot better
than the choice that you made.

38:20.376 --> 38:24.111
Oh. Hey. Hey, "Woman" by Wolfmother.
That is destined to be a classic.

38:24.136 --> 38:25.611
On what planet?

38:27.655 --> 38:31.651
Now... I now we're pretending
to be normal,

38:31.687 --> 38:34.750
and I know we're pretending
that this isn't awkward, but, uh...

38:35.757 --> 38:39.830
- it's kinda awkward, isn't it?
- Yeah. Kinda.

38:40.766 --> 38:44.322
So, what do we... just gonna say
that this never happened?

38:44.376 --> 38:45.882
Well, I know...

38:46.725 --> 38:48.841
we should talk about this, but...

38:49.008 --> 38:51.710
these days I just feel like
my head's gonna explode.

38:51.775 --> 38:54.273
It's just a lot of stuff going on.

38:54.747 --> 38:55.940
Gates.

38:56.475 --> 38:58.702
I'm trying to figure it out.

38:58.986 --> 39:01.793
I-I, I want to figure it out.
It-it, it's just...

39:03.308 --> 39:05.050
I just need some time.

39:07.078 --> 39:08.660
Yeah, I've been there once before.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.750
Didn't turn out so good for me.

39:11.397 --> 39:13.412
Well, you won't have to wait long.

39:13.736 --> 39:14.821
Okay?

39:16.216 --> 39:17.472
Okay.

39:18.166 --> 39:19.880
Oh, yes. B-10!

39:19.975 --> 39:22.950
- Ah, somebody make it stop!
- Sam, come and dance with us!

39:23.005 --> 39:25.782
- Please!
- Ah... all right.

39:27.207 --> 39:29.821
Oh. Wait a second, you guys.
Be right back.

39:30.777 --> 39:33.873
Hello? Hey, wait. I can barely hear you.
Hold on!

39:34.016 --> 39:36.233
No, no, no. Don't hang up.
Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

39:36.705 --> 39:37.762
Alex?

39:38.006 --> 39:42.091
Hey. I'm so glad you called.
I was worried.

39:42.528 --> 39:43.743
Yeah?

39:44.165 --> 39:47.832
Yeah, it is my birthday.
Thank you.

39:48.967 --> 39:50.322
You okay?

40:04.827 --> 40:08.813
If the test says you're my dad,
can I stay with you?

40:09.066 --> 40:10.670
Absolutely.

40:12.265 --> 40:13.952
Okay.

40:18.008 --> 40:19.460
You sure?

40:20.626 --> 40:22.141
Is it gonna hurt?

40:24.035 --> 40:25.411
No. No, we just...

40:26.008 --> 40:29.853
take a little swab on one cheek.

40:31.265 --> 40:37.783
And we send it to the lab and then
they send us the results in the mail.

40:39.995 --> 40:42.100
- That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

40:44.378 --> 40:46.072
And until then?

40:47.205 --> 40:49.112
Nothing changes.

40:57.975 --> 41:00.192
Of course I'm coming up this weekend.

41:01.327 --> 41:02.541
Yeah.

41:03.415 --> 41:06.312
Uh, well, maybe.
What if I brought you...?

41:06.787 --> 41:08.232
Oh, you gotta go?

41:08.616 --> 41:10.523
Okay, time's up.
I got it.

41:13.515 --> 41:15.203
I miss you, too.

41:16.795 --> 41:18.992
Thanks for calling me, okay?

41:21.485 --> 41:23.100
I love you, too, baby.

41:24.146 --> 41:25.621
Okay.

41:26.435 --> 41:27.570
Bye.

41:47.906 --> 41:51.603
So you've already got a law degree
and now you're going to medical school.

41:51.737 --> 41:55.151
Eh, corporate law wasn't for me.
I wasn't helping anyone.

41:55.205 --> 41:57.951
Besides, I need to be
where the action is.

41:59.207 --> 42:00.952
What?! What is this?!

42:00.975 --> 42:03.311
Come on, you jokers,
get out on the dance floor.

42:03.377 --> 42:04.930
- Come on.
- No, sorry. No chance.

42:05.005 --> 42:07.492
Oh, come on, Frank.
You know you want to. Larry?

42:15.265 --> 42:20.430
Times like these, I see
all these young people together...

42:23.615 --> 42:27.073
...makes me fear
for the future of mankind.

42:32.786 --> 42:35.573
