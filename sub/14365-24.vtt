00:01.710 --> 00:05.440
<i>Previously on "Transformers Prime"...</i>

00:05.510 --> 00:08.180
Well, aren't you the clever one?

00:09.280 --> 00:15.020
You shall serve as a constant
reminder to those who dare fail me.

00:16.090 --> 00:17.590
What?!

00:17.660 --> 00:20.460
Three keys are accounted for.

00:23.930 --> 00:27.830
It would seem
I have the run of the place.

00:27.900 --> 00:30.640
Ah, there you are.

00:37.540 --> 00:42.650
The fate of Cybertron now
rests in Starscream's hands...

00:42.720 --> 00:45.550
whatever his intention.

00:45.620 --> 00:49.990
Please pardon my unannounced
visit, Lord Megatron.

00:54.690 --> 00:59.030
But I have come bearing
a peace offering.

01:06.610 --> 01:10.010
Few things of value come
without a price.

01:10.080 --> 01:14.550
So, tell me, Starscream, what is
it that you wish in return?

01:14.610 --> 01:18.120
Only to be a Decepticon once again.

01:18.180 --> 01:21.290
Dreadwing is my
first lieutenant now.

01:21.350 --> 01:25.290
And I accept that much has
changed during my absence.

01:25.360 --> 01:29.600
I only wish to serve
you, my one true master,

01:29.600 --> 01:32.430
in any way that you deem fit.

01:32.500 --> 01:36.400
I am deeply impressed by your
accomplishment, Starscream.

01:36.470 --> 01:41.710
And know that I will put your offerings
to good use, whatever the outcome.

01:41.770 --> 01:46.240
Uh, outcome?
Of what?

01:46.310 --> 01:50.450
See to it that Knockout is
extracted from the wall.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.720
Ah, it's good to be back.

02:02.660 --> 02:09.270
Now, what will we be
fishing for today, my liege?

02:11.640 --> 02:15.740
Starscream's true motives.

03:17.790 --> 03:24.930
Decepticons, it is with deep
sorrow that I note for the log,

03:25.000 --> 03:30.570
Megatron's spark has been extinguished.

03:31.540 --> 03:36.340
All hail Starscream.

03:36.410 --> 03:38.850
<i>All hail Starscream!</i>

03:38.910 --> 03:44.420
<i>Well, well. You certainly
didn't waste any time.</i>

03:45.075 --> 03:48.420
What?!
I just watched you perish!

03:48.490 --> 03:53.230
I did not perish then, and
I'm very much with you now ...

03:53.300 --> 03:57.230
the present you
as well as the past.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.330
<i>All hail Starscream!</i>

03:59.400 --> 04:02.670
<i>I can't hear you!</i>

04:02.740 --> 04:04.640
<i>All hail Starscream!</i>

04:04.710 --> 04:06.170
<i>One more time!</i>

04:06.240 --> 04:10.510
<i>All hail Starscream!
All hail Starscream!</i>

04:10.580 --> 04:13.680
This is going to be juicy.

04:13.750 --> 04:17.180
<i>All hail Starscream!</i>

04:18.320 --> 04:22.960
- You're inside my head, aren't you?
- The cortical psychic patch.

04:23.030 --> 04:28.630
You see, there are no secrets in
here... only your memories.

04:28.700 --> 04:33.200
You cannot manipulate their
content or modify their outcome.

04:33.270 --> 04:36.770
What we see is how it happened.

04:36.840 --> 04:41.310
If you want to be a true
leader, Starscream, then stray

04:41.380 --> 04:45.950
from Megatron's path and lead
the Decepticons toward peace.

04:46.020 --> 04:51.650
I would be willing to consider
a truce... if you would

04:51.720 --> 04:56.220
be willing to bow before me,
Optimus Prime.

04:56.290 --> 04:59.390
You have defied my orders yet again!

04:59.460 --> 05:02.360
My mistake,
Commander Starscream.

05:02.430 --> 05:05.390
It is Lord!

05:06.430 --> 05:11.470
Haven't you heard?
I lead the Decepticons now.

05:11.540 --> 05:14.910
<i>Now, where did we leave off?</i>

05:14.980 --> 05:18.480
<i>Oh, yes, "all hail Starscream"?</i>

05:18.850 --> 05:22.380
A rather obvious motif, Starscream.

05:22.650 --> 05:25.920
You deem yourself more able to
lead the Decepticons than myself?!

05:25.990 --> 05:30.620
No, not anymore. I have learned
from my many failures, master.

05:30.690 --> 05:35.630
Esteemed members of my armada...

05:35.700 --> 05:40.530
you now stand upon the very
precipice of glory... to meet

05:40.600 --> 05:45.140
the destiny which I have so
tenaciously worked toward.

05:45.210 --> 05:48.910
Dynamic leadership of the Decepticons.

05:48.980 --> 05:51.410
That clone said it, not me!

05:51.480 --> 05:57.020
It seems you would stop at nothing to
disrupt my rule, including assassination.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.820
It was their idea, not mine!

05:59.890 --> 06:04.907
With this creature under your
control and at our disposal, we might

06:04.907 --> 06:11.870
employ it to terminate Megatron,
allowing us to rule the Decepticons.

06:11.930 --> 06:14.530
I see no clones here.
Was this their idea, too?

06:14.600 --> 06:16.840
I don't remember any of this.

06:18.140 --> 06:23.040
I must have been half-crazed at the
time, a victim of Energon deficiency.

06:23.110 --> 06:26.580
Tell me why I should welcome
back someone whose every waking

06:26.650 --> 06:31.520
impulse has been to thwart me,
undercut me, overthrow me?!

06:31.590 --> 06:38.160
<i>Not true. I have always put
your well-being before my own.</i>

06:38.230 --> 06:43.430
How does this revolting chapter
constitute attending to my well-being?

06:43.500 --> 06:48.970
I was simply trying to help by ridding
you of the dark matter polluting your body.

06:49.040 --> 06:52.710
Seems I possess the only thing
that would allow you to rise off

06:52.780 --> 06:58.250
that slab and walk again,
my dearest Megatron.

06:58.310 --> 07:01.880
<i>I even risked being
buried alive for you.</i>

07:04.520 --> 07:10.990
I did not abandon you, master.
I returned to save you!

07:12.930 --> 07:19.100
Look into my spark, Lord Megatron.
My intentions were true.

07:19.170 --> 07:23.200
Were they, Starscream?
Were they ever?!

07:23.270 --> 07:26.640
Well, now who has hit rock bottom?

07:26.710 --> 07:29.040
What's that?
I'm sorry.

07:29.110 --> 07:31.950
I can't hear you
beneath all that rubble.

07:34.650 --> 07:38.020
Farewell, Lord Megatron.

07:38.090 --> 07:41.220
May you rust in peace!

07:44.190 --> 07:46.690
But you have survived far worse.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.500
If you managed to free yourself,
you would blame me for your setback.

07:50.570 --> 07:54.700
And there is nowhere that I could
possibly escape from your wrath.

07:54.770 --> 07:58.410
Or, worse yet, your mindless
followers will come looking for you

07:58.470 --> 08:04.380
and take credit for your rescue,
credit that could rightfully be mine!

08:06.080 --> 08:11.020
<i> Megatron!</i>

08:12.150 --> 08:16.560
A word of advice?
Stop thinking aloud.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.090
I don't want to
play this game anymore.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.860
Take the keys.
We'll pretend I was never here.

08:21.930 --> 08:25.430
No, Starscream.
There are only two possible

08:25.500 --> 08:30.700
outcomes based upon what I find
here in your twisted, little mind.

08:30.770 --> 08:36.659
If I do not deem that you are
worthy of rejoining the Decepticons,

08:36.750 --> 08:40.010
you will perish on this very day.

08:45.863 --> 08:48.370
<i>Isn't termination rather extreme?</i>

08:48.440 --> 08:53.510
I mean, a really good trouncing
usually straightens me out, doesn't it?

09:07.630 --> 09:09.030
No, master.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.490
<i>Nooo!</i>

09:11.560 --> 09:16.030
Why wouldn't you wish to harness
my talents for the Decepticon cause?

09:16.100 --> 09:20.040
You and I have so much
deviousness to offer.

09:22.570 --> 09:27.680
Consider it a "welcome home" present.

09:27.750 --> 09:33.180
<i>- See how generous I can be, my liege?
- When it suits you...</i>

09:38.690 --> 09:44.330
Master, that's your plan?! Bring
Autobots back from the dead to attack us?!

09:44.400 --> 09:48.160
<i>At other times, you could be
quite insulant.</i>

09:48.230 --> 09:51.900
Apologies.
It's just that I'd gone to so

09:51.970 --> 09:56.540
much trouble to terminate the
Autobot in the first place.

09:57.010 --> 10:00.180
<i>Trouble would have been
facing him as a gladiator.</i>

10:00.250 --> 10:04.380
<i>I've always considered my
wits to be my sharpest weapon.</i>

10:04.450 --> 10:09.850
Wait.
You two are up to something.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.270
<i>You never learn, Starscream.</i>

10:24.340 --> 10:28.500
<i>Your arrogance will trump your
wits every time.</i>

10:28.570 --> 10:33.480
You cannot harm me while Dark
Energon flows through my veins!

10:33.550 --> 10:35.910
I am invincible!

10:46.590 --> 10:50.460
You're a big one.
This could take a while.

11:03.070 --> 11:06.310
What? She's taking credit
for scraping him now, too?

11:06.380 --> 11:09.410
That was my doing!

11:09.480 --> 11:12.550
Oh, no!
No! No!

11:12.620 --> 11:15.720
Any last words, Smokescreen?

11:26.260 --> 11:27.530
My T-Cog.

11:27.600 --> 11:32.000
A, uh ... a temporary setback.
Other Autobots, other T-Cogs.

11:32.070 --> 11:35.370
We shall find a replacement soon enough.

11:35.440 --> 11:39.940
Not "soon enough".
Now.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.230
Huh? What?

12:01.100 --> 12:04.100
<i>Autobots!</i>

12:09.640 --> 12:13.040
My T-Cog!

12:13.110 --> 12:17.050
<i>You no longer possess the
ability to take flight?!</i>

12:17.120 --> 12:21.520
Uh, yes, I-I was
going to bring that up.

12:21.590 --> 12:26.420
And, as you might imagine, my
predicament pains me to no end.

12:26.490 --> 12:30.390
Fortunately, the Harbingers'
tracking systems have remained

12:30.460 --> 12:32.560
synched with Megatron's warship.

12:32.630 --> 12:38.600
Of course, we shall require a
means of reaching the ...

12:39.500 --> 12:43.470
You can transform?!
Uh, of course you can.

12:43.540 --> 12:46.180
How else would you fly to the ship?

12:46.240 --> 12:50.950
That was a test in
which you all... passed.

12:51.020 --> 12:54.220
<i>I hope that you might see fit to
express your gratitude for the</i>

12:54.290 --> 12:57.820
<i>Omega keys by restoring my jet mode.</i>

12:57.890 --> 13:03.330
<i>After all, would I not be more
valuable to you with wings?</i>

13:43.330 --> 13:48.640
<i>Ooh, I do transform with an
exceptional sense of style.</i>

13:52.410 --> 13:55.680
I said that aloud, didn't I?

13:56.150 --> 13:59.980
Megatron tried to extinguish my
spark in cold blood, then all

14:00.050 --> 14:03.550
but replaced me with that
traitorous wretch, Airachnid.

14:03.620 --> 14:09.890
She abandoned me, left me for scrap!
So why not rat them out?

14:09.960 --> 14:13.200
<i>No one asked you to leave the
Decepticon fold.</i>

14:13.260 --> 14:16.430
<i>But I wasn't exactly made to
feel welcome at the time.</i>

14:17.670 --> 14:23.240
Master, please, give me one
more chance! I beg of you!

14:23.310 --> 14:26.910
<i>Despite the fact that I had seen
the error of my ways and</i>

14:26.980 --> 14:29.202
<i>dedicated my spark to you.</i>

14:29.428 --> 14:31.196
I have gained a clear

14:31.196 --> 14:36.950
understanding of my place in
this universe... of who I am...

14:37.020 --> 14:40.420
of who I was always meant to be.

14:40.490 --> 14:44.560
Starscream, second in command,

14:44.560 --> 14:48.630
humble servant to Lord Megatron.

14:48.700 --> 14:52.740
<i>Until the next opportunity
arises to subvert me.</i>

14:52.800 --> 14:56.310
And how is the patient doing
today?

14:56.370 --> 14:58.240
Same old.

14:58.310 --> 15:04.310
An inglorious fate that he should
remain in this vegetative state.

15:04.380 --> 15:05.920
On the contrary.

15:05.980 --> 15:11.490
Megatron's body may be scrap metal,
but his mind is still percolating.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.260
Keep that to yourself.

15:13.320 --> 15:16.660
That blasted Soundwave
sees and hears everything.

15:16.730 --> 15:19.460
The eyes and ears of the Decepticons.

15:19.530 --> 15:24.770
Well, as long as their master
remains in limbo, so does their cause.

15:24.840 --> 15:29.410
The Decepticons deserve
a strong, alert leader.

15:29.470 --> 15:33.380
One who would require
a loyal second in command.

15:34.610 --> 15:39.050
A candidate would need to earn
that post by making a strong

15:39.120 --> 15:42.650
case to said eyes and ears.

15:42.720 --> 15:46.720
A case for showing mercy,
Lord Starscream?

15:46.790 --> 15:47.760
Uh-oh.

15:47.830 --> 15:51.230
Does this thing have a fast-forward
button or, better yet, erase?

15:52.430 --> 15:55.970
Knockout, if you would be so
kind as to provide your expert

15:56.030 --> 16:01.200
medical opinion to Soundwave
for the historical record.

16:01.270 --> 16:07.410
Simply put, unaided, Megatron could
remain in this deathless slumber forever.

16:07.480 --> 16:11.810
Our master would not have
wanted to be seen this way, to

16:11.880 --> 16:19.260
stand idly by while he remains
captive in his own body... is not just.

16:23.790 --> 16:27.760
Brain-Wave activity ... not
evidence of consciousness, but

16:27.830 --> 16:31.930
merely of an endless dream from
which Megatron may never wake.

16:32.000 --> 16:38.410
Soundwave, we must face reality.
Megatron is lost to us.

16:38.480 --> 16:43.280
The only honorable option
would be to show him mercy.

16:43.350 --> 16:47.080
A simple throw of the switch.

16:47.150 --> 16:51.690
When Megatron comes out of it, he'll do
more than just stick me back in that wall.

16:51.760 --> 16:59.200
He'll have Starscream's head and mine!

16:59.260 --> 17:02.230
But... if I disconnect

17:02.270 --> 17:07.369
before a proper power-down,
the link is severed and...

17:07.410 --> 17:12.240
the big guy will never
emerge from Starscream's head.

17:30.240 --> 17:36.740
Everything okay here?

17:36.810 --> 17:38.980
Just checking cable integrity.

17:39.050 --> 17:43.280
<i>Is it any wonder that I've come
to value loyalty above all else?</i>

17:44.590 --> 17:47.520
Well, you know, we are Decepticons.

17:47.590 --> 17:51.030
I'm sure that even your beloved
Dreadwing isn't perfect.

17:51.090 --> 17:55.060
No one is perfect,
Starscream, but like his

17:55.130 --> 17:59.270
departed twin, Dreadwing
understands honor.

17:59.340 --> 18:05.940
Awaken, warrior.
Rise and serve your new master!

18:11.310 --> 18:16.720
- Skyquake serves only one master.
- Excellent.

18:16.790 --> 18:21.590
Your loyalty and devotion will
set a fine example for the troops.

18:21.660 --> 18:25.660
No need to be timid, Skyquake.
You may bow.

18:25.730 --> 18:28.600
You fail to grasp my meaning.

18:28.670 --> 18:35.340
I am here on a mission assigned to
me by my one master ... Megatron.

18:35.410 --> 18:37.440
Yes... him.

18:37.510 --> 18:41.340
Sadly, Megatron is...
no longer with us.

18:41.410 --> 18:43.080
Impossible.

18:43.150 --> 18:47.480
Why is this so difficult for
everyone to accept?

19:18.610 --> 19:22.920
Ah, the grave site of the
mighty Skyquake.

19:22.990 --> 19:27.520
So quick to reject my
authority while you lived.

19:27.590 --> 19:35.330
But, as the first of my reanimated
warriors, you shall bow to my command.

19:49.150 --> 19:56.320
Yes!
Power of Dark Energon, be mine!

19:59.560 --> 20:01.260
Symbiosis.

20:04.190 --> 20:06.190
<i>I can feel it!</i>

20:06.260 --> 20:09.100
<i>I understand he perished that day.</i>

20:09.170 --> 20:13.790
<i>Well, Skyquake is neither living
nor dead and no doubt continues to</i>

20:13.790 --> 20:18.410
wander through some dimensional
never-realm in search of his missing limb.

20:19.710 --> 20:24.150
<i>It would be wise to keep that
to yourself around the warship.</i>

20:29.320 --> 20:33.220
Awkward.

20:33.290 --> 20:36.090
