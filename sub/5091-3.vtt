WEBVTT

00:08.882 --> 00:12.018
Econ 3200-
where juniors go to die.

00:12.019 --> 00:13.302
Here's what I learned.

00:13.303 --> 00:15.321
The laffer curve? Not so funny.

00:15.322 --> 00:17.657
You sure you don't
want to come with us?

00:17.658 --> 00:19.442
And put down this page-turner?

00:19.443 --> 00:21.644
I'll catch you guys later.

00:23.000 --> 00:29.074

01:11.879 --> 01:13.379
No!

01:19.887 --> 01:22.255
What, are you flying solo, Reagan?

01:22.256 --> 01:24.307
My partner banged in sick.

01:24.308 --> 01:25.591
What do we got?

01:25.592 --> 01:27.176
Uh, victim's n is
Courtney Thurman.

01:27.177 --> 01:28.711
She's a freshman at the college.

01:28.712 --> 01:30.897
She was on her way
home from the library.

01:30.898 --> 01:33.316
Next thing she knows,
perp's got her on the ground,

01:33.317 --> 01:34.884
yanks her jeans,
rips her underwear.

01:34.885 --> 01:36.235
And then the crazy part.

01:36.236 --> 01:38.220
He didn't finish the deed. Yeah.

01:38.221 --> 01:39.722
This is the second sexual assault

01:39.723 --> 01:40.890
we had on campus tonight.

01:40.891 --> 01:42.992
Send your kid to college
to get an education,

01:42.993 --> 01:44.694
instead, you get some
mutt collecting trophies.

01:44.695 --> 01:45.895
How's the girl? She's okay.

01:45.896 --> 01:47.062
She's a little shook up.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.748
She seems like a pretty good kid.

01:48.749 --> 01:50.566
She able to identify the perp?
No, some goon

01:50.567 --> 01:52.234
with a stocking pulled
over his face. She say

01:52.235 --> 01:54.236
anything about an SUV? Yeah,
she said she was followed

01:54.237 --> 01:55.588
by a black escalade.

01:55.589 --> 01:57.874
Great... panties,
stocking, escalade.

01:57.875 --> 01:59.074
It's the same mo.

01:59.075 --> 02:01.627
We got a sexual
predator on a spree.

02:04.715 --> 02:08.851
No, no, no, you got to
go back the other way.

02:08.852 --> 02:10.269
I got it. I got it.

02:10.270 --> 02:11.721
Yeah. Right.

02:11.722 --> 02:12.922
Yeah.

02:12.923 --> 02:15.107
Ow.

02:15.108 --> 02:17.259
No, you're supposed to hit
the other guy in the head.

02:17.260 --> 02:19.028
Yeah, yeah. Sydney:
What about Morgan hall?

02:19.029 --> 02:20.596
Remember Patricia's wedding?

02:20.597 --> 02:22.782
It was beautiful,
wasn't it? Sure, Syd.

02:22.783 --> 02:27.370
I was thinking about going
topless to the wedding.

02:27.371 --> 02:28.604
You okay with that?

02:28.605 --> 02:29.872
Sounds good.

02:29.873 --> 02:32.608
Did you see that?

02:32.609 --> 02:33.793
No. Do it again.

02:33.794 --> 02:35.778
Ah. Yeah.

02:35.779 --> 02:36.996
Getting there. I got to.

02:36.997 --> 02:38.164
Whatever you do,

02:38.165 --> 02:39.715
stay away from Morgan hall.

02:39.716 --> 02:41.467
The food?

02:41.468 --> 02:43.669
The bad luck.

02:46.556 --> 02:49.592
What's wrong, Syd?

02:49.593 --> 02:51.344
You have your own problems.

02:51.345 --> 02:52.979
You don't need to hear mine.

02:52.980 --> 02:54.597
The only problem I have right now

02:54.598 --> 02:56.983
is in San Francisco
with my daughter.

02:56.984 --> 02:59.134
Want a cup of tea?

02:59.135 --> 03:01.303
It's just...

03:02.489 --> 03:05.024
You know, I'm happy Jamie's
doing something he loves.

03:05.025 --> 03:06.308
It's nothing.

03:06.309 --> 03:09.862
A Harvard lawyer put a
ring on your finger,

03:09.863 --> 03:12.915
and you're walking down the
aisle with a rookie cop?

03:12.916 --> 03:14.533
You have every reason

03:14.534 --> 03:15.751
to be thrown by that.

03:15.752 --> 03:16.953
No, it's not that, really.

03:16.954 --> 03:19.154
I'd marry Jamie if
he worked a booth

03:19.155 --> 03:20.623
in the midtown tunnel.

03:20.624 --> 03:24.293
Just as long as I didn't feel like

03:24.294 --> 03:27.513
he loved taking tolls more
than he loved talking to me.

03:27.514 --> 03:29.215
You can't take it personally, Syd.

03:29.216 --> 03:31.534
It's not you. It's the job.

03:31.535 --> 03:33.335
It's like my mother used to say.

03:33.336 --> 03:34.804
A woman cannot compete

03:34.805 --> 03:36.338
with the gun and the shield.

03:36.339 --> 03:38.724
Is that why you never
dated any cops?

03:38.725 --> 03:41.310
Geez. Yeah.

03:41.311 --> 03:43.279
Probably. Instead,

03:43.280 --> 03:46.198
I married a defense attorney who
turned out to be a sleazebag.

03:46.199 --> 03:47.450
So what do I know?

03:52.289 --> 03:53.539
Anything else, Courtney?

03:53.540 --> 03:55.658
Can you describe his voice?

03:55.659 --> 03:57.693
He never said a word.

03:57.694 --> 03:58.878
What about his hands?

03:58.879 --> 04:00.429
Were they rough, soft?

04:00.430 --> 04:03.249
Did they have any distinct
odor coming off him? I'm sorry.

04:04.484 --> 04:06.335
It just happened so suddenly,
you know?

04:06.336 --> 04:07.703
I do.

04:07.704 --> 04:09.088
It's all right.

04:09.089 --> 04:10.756
It's all right.

04:10.757 --> 04:12.258
Hey, detective? Yeah.

04:12.259 --> 04:14.844
Excuse me. Yeah.

04:14.845 --> 04:16.545
Anonymous call to
911 just reported

04:16.546 --> 04:18.930
a female screaming for help
eight blocks from here.

04:18.932 --> 04:21.100
You're kidding me.

04:21.101 --> 04:23.269
All right.

04:24.554 --> 04:26.772
This is so Nick and Nora. I mean,

04:26.773 --> 04:28.407
this whole place to ourselves?

04:28.408 --> 04:30.326
How do you do it? In this economy?

04:30.327 --> 04:31.494
I just called around

04:31.495 --> 04:33.279
till I found someone
who needed business.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.032
No. That veal chop would have
a line around the corner.

04:36.033 --> 04:37.833
Well, maybe this is
the night he closes.

04:37.834 --> 04:39.201
But he opened just for you.

04:39.202 --> 04:41.670
Well, maybe someone
saved his life once.

04:41.671 --> 04:43.873
Well...

04:43.874 --> 04:45.958
Someone saved his life once?

04:45.959 --> 04:48.344
Robber had a knife at his throat,

04:48.345 --> 04:50.713
and then he didn't.

04:53.266 --> 04:56.185
Well, this is a risk, Frank.

04:56.186 --> 04:59.271
Well, risk is the price
you pay for opportunity.

04:59.272 --> 05:00.923
And what sort of opportunity?

05:00.924 --> 05:03.359
The opportunity of sitting
across from you at dinner,

05:03.360 --> 05:04.794
thinking about later.

05:04.795 --> 05:06.729
Hmm.

05:19.576 --> 05:21.827
Keep it off the air.

05:21.828 --> 05:24.580
I want the chief of
d's there to brief me.

05:24.581 --> 05:27.049
Same with Manhattan north.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.920
Am I going to see you later?

05:30.921 --> 05:32.054
I don't think so.

05:32.055 --> 05:34.390
Anything you'd like to share?

05:34.391 --> 05:36.592
Yes, there is.

05:38.895 --> 05:41.313
Gee, thanks.

05:44.401 --> 05:46.602
I'm sorry about this.

05:59.583 --> 06:01.483
Yeah, get me the news desk.

06:01.484 --> 06:03.669
Hey, it's Kelly.

06:03.670 --> 06:06.155
Listen, there's something
happening Manhattan north,

06:06.156 --> 06:08.457
and it's not on the police radio.

06:08.458 --> 06:09.758
Talk to me.

06:09.759 --> 06:11.510
Victim's Lauren Ryder-
student at the university.

06:11.511 --> 06:14.180
She's beat pretty bad,
not saying much too much.

06:14.181 --> 06:16.132
But I'll tell you this.

06:16.133 --> 06:19.001
The guy who raped her was
a mean son of a bitch.

06:19.002 --> 06:20.386
Hold on. He raped her? Yeah.

06:20.387 --> 06:22.504
Great. So this guy's been
building up the courage

06:22.505 --> 06:24.306
all night to finally
take what he wanted.

06:24.307 --> 06:26.192
The only good news is that,
in the struggle,

06:26.193 --> 06:27.643
she grabbed at the perp's mask.

06:27.644 --> 06:29.311
Got a glimpse of him
before he hit her again.

06:29.312 --> 06:30.896
She able to I.D. The guy?

06:30.897 --> 06:32.448
Caucasian, medium build.

06:32.449 --> 06:33.983
Thinks he's got brown hair.

06:33.984 --> 06:36.152
Oh. That's a start.

06:36.153 --> 06:37.369
Two students were attacked,

06:37.370 --> 06:39.371
and then there was an
escalation to rape.

06:39.372 --> 06:41.857
We have a sexual predator
targeting university co-eds.

06:41.858 --> 06:43.358
That's why you called me in?

06:43.359 --> 06:45.377
I felt it was important, sir.

06:45.378 --> 06:47.079
Baker, you did good.

06:47.080 --> 06:49.081
Where are we at with it?

06:49.082 --> 06:51.083
Chief of d's had all
surveillance video pulled

06:51.084 --> 06:54.753
from the area's Argus system
and forwarded it to major case.

06:54.754 --> 06:57.039
Manhattan north has
doubled police patrols.

06:57.040 --> 06:59.475
Get the names and numbers
for the victims' families.

06:59.476 --> 07:02.645
They should hear from the NYPD
before the press breaks this.

07:02.646 --> 07:04.180
Commissioner.

07:04.181 --> 07:07.516
Kelly : Yes, Joe,
we are here live.

07:07.517 --> 07:09.318
It's a gruesome scene
at Morningside park

07:09.319 --> 07:10.936
as the latest victim in
a string of assaults...

07:10.937 --> 07:15.107
Can you turn up the
volume on that one?

07:15.108 --> 07:16.725
...Here on the scene,
and unfortunately,

07:16.726 --> 07:17.893
they're aren't any suspects yet,

07:17.894 --> 07:19.578
but the police are
canvassing the area,

07:19.579 --> 07:21.947
so hopefully,
we'll hear something soon.

07:21.948 --> 07:23.065
Pretty soon, they'll be able

07:23.066 --> 07:25.084
to report the news
before it happens.

08:05.104 --> 08:06.604
Reagan, where are we? Hey, sarge.

08:06.605 --> 08:07.739
We got the sketch artist

08:07.740 --> 08:08.922
over at the hospital
with the rape victim.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.273
She's in and out of consciousness,

08:10.274 --> 08:11.424
but they're working on a likeness.

08:11.425 --> 08:12.592
All right, put it up in the media.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.110
Put it up in the neighborhood.
I'm on it.

08:14.111 --> 08:15.311
What do you got?

08:15.312 --> 08:17.197
NYPD Argus footage,

08:17.198 --> 08:18.731
and, uh, the university's
own surveillance.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.951
Hopefully, somewhere in here I
get a look at this escalade.

08:21.952 --> 08:24.787
I think of my own daughter.

08:24.788 --> 08:26.990
Yeah.

08:28.993 --> 08:30.960
Patrols have been
doubled on campus.

08:30.961 --> 08:32.578
Additional foot-posts
have been added.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.964
And anti-crime units will
be running regular sweeps

08:34.965 --> 08:36.299
through the area.

08:36.299 --> 08:38.451
Does NYPD have any suspects?
Do you have any suspects?

08:38.452 --> 08:39.802
Not yet, Willis. We're in

08:39.803 --> 08:41.221
the early stages of
the investigation.

08:41.222 --> 08:43.456
Do we have a description
of the rapist?

08:43.457 --> 08:44.724
White male, medium build,

08:44.725 --> 08:46.426
in his 20s or 30s.

08:46.427 --> 08:48.511
Do you have any firm leads,
commissioner?

08:48.512 --> 08:51.648
I think I already answered
that question, miss Davidson.

08:51.649 --> 08:53.933
Thank you. That's all for now.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.019
Commissioner! One more question!

08:59.190 --> 09:02.025
Mr. Ryder?

09:02.026 --> 09:04.644
I'm detective Reagan.

09:04.645 --> 09:07.447
They just gave her a
shot to help her sleep.

09:07.448 --> 09:10.116
We're gonna do all we can

09:10.117 --> 09:12.652
to get the guy who did
this to your daughter, sir.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.837
They say the next 24
hours are critical.

09:17.007 --> 09:18.991
Look, I know this is
uncomfortable for you,

09:18.992 --> 09:21.427
but I do have to ask you
some questions, sir.

09:21.428 --> 09:22.762
Your daughter, um......

09:22.763 --> 09:24.597
any reason to think
she was targeted?

09:24.598 --> 09:26.933
Ex-boyfriend,
problems with a stalker?

09:26.934 --> 09:29.335
No. No, I don't think so.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.387
She-she would have told me.

09:31.388 --> 09:33.723
We speak every day on the phone.

09:33.724 --> 09:36.226
She got an a on her biology test.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.695
She's, uh, premed.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.015
Did she do any work
outside of school?

09:43.016 --> 09:44.867
Part-time job?

09:44.868 --> 09:46.035
No. She's on scholarship.

09:46.036 --> 09:49.072
I give her all the
pocket money she needs.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.576
I just keep thinking

09:53.577 --> 09:57.530
about how... scared
she must have been.

09:57.531 --> 09:59.916
I'm really sorry, Mr. Ryder.

09:59.917 --> 10:03.169
Yeah. Please. Walter.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.387
Walter.

10:04.388 --> 10:07.540
See, it's just been the two of us.

10:07.541 --> 10:08.891
We, uh...

10:08.892 --> 10:12.061
...Lost her mother 15
years ago to cancer.

10:12.062 --> 10:14.264
Not a day has passed

10:14.265 --> 10:16.716
that I don't wish that she
was still here with us.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.269
Until today.

10:20.387 --> 10:24.324
Today, I'm happy she's not here.

10:29.747 --> 10:31.230
Shouldn't we be doing something?

10:31.231 --> 10:33.666
We are.

10:33.667 --> 10:35.868
Besides contributing to
your high cholesterol.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.670
Why don't we recanvass
those electronic stores?

10:37.671 --> 10:39.589
You know, maybe that
stickup guy hits again.

10:39.590 --> 10:40.790
Let me tell you something.

10:40.791 --> 10:42.241
Lots of cops burn themselves out

10:42.242 --> 10:43.376
chasing down every half-assed lead

10:43.377 --> 10:45.044
like it's the French connection,

10:45.045 --> 10:48.598
but never learning the
secret to being a good cop.

10:48.599 --> 10:49.849
Is that extra mayo?

10:49.850 --> 10:52.418
Hey, I make the jokes around here,
rookie. All right.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.137
I'm talking about the
art of doing nothing.

10:54.138 --> 10:56.255
It's amazing you don't have
your own command by now.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.607
I'm serious.

10:57.608 --> 11:01.110
NYPD will spend millions of
dollars of hours and manpower

11:01.111 --> 11:04.063
setting up stings and takedowns,

11:04.064 --> 11:09.035
but if they just taught more
cops the art of observing...

11:09.036 --> 11:11.704
What, nannies, skateboarders?

11:11.705 --> 11:14.574
Well, for instance,
that yupster over there

11:14.575 --> 11:16.442
in the mandals, eleven o'clock,

11:16.443 --> 11:17.543
what do you think he's doing?

11:17.544 --> 11:18.961
He's reading the newspaper. No.

11:18.962 --> 11:20.963
That's what he wants his
wife to think he's doing.

11:20.964 --> 11:22.215
What he's really doing

11:22.216 --> 11:25.117
is checking out those
blondes doing tai chi.

11:26.970 --> 11:29.839
That's great, we can arrest him
for having impure thoughts.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.057
Okay, wiseass.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.475
You see that?

11:32.476 --> 11:33.676
What?

11:33.677 --> 11:36.229
The guy in the suit... look at him.

11:36.230 --> 11:37.797
See him touching his hip like
he's looking for something?

11:37.798 --> 11:39.148
What, checking to see if
his wallet's still there?

11:39.149 --> 11:41.267
You wear your wallet on your hip?

11:41.268 --> 11:43.069
Huh?

11:43.070 --> 11:45.304
That guy's got a gun, Reagan.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.440
He does? Well,
let's go toss him. No.

11:47.441 --> 11:48.691
Why not? What, a gun collar?

11:48.692 --> 11:51.244
Are you crazy? Why not?
'Cause he's a cop, Reagan.

11:51.245 --> 11:53.830
Mike Respoli.

11:53.831 --> 11:55.915
Works out of the 2-5.

11:55.916 --> 11:59.001
He plays on my softball team-
center field.

12:02.339 --> 12:07.126
Okay, so I knew... but you didn't.

12:09.129 --> 12:11.330
All right.

12:22.693 --> 12:25.361
I wish I could be more helpful.

12:25.362 --> 12:27.814
He was behind me,
I never got a real look at him.

12:27.815 --> 12:30.516
He had a stocking over his head.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.651
It was horrible.

12:31.652 --> 12:33.219
Was there anything else
you might have forgotten,

12:33.220 --> 12:35.538
any small details you
might have left out?

12:36.356 --> 12:39.242
I heard about the other girl.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.879
I guess I was lucky.

12:42.880 --> 12:45.364
Hard to say it was luck,
what happened to you.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.366
Hey.

12:47.367 --> 12:50.253
Uh, they didn't have
tomato and rice, so...

12:50.254 --> 12:52.338
It's vegetable, okay? Perfect.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.223
This is my best friend Renee
and my boyfriend Blake.

12:54.224 --> 12:55.875
This is the detective I
was telling you about.

12:55.876 --> 12:58.728
He just wanted to ask
me some more questions.

12:58.729 --> 13:00.880
Should we come back? Danny: No,
no, actually, uh,

13:00.881 --> 13:02.148
maybe you can help.

13:02.149 --> 13:03.933
Take a look at this sketch,
see if it reminds you

13:03.934 --> 13:05.651
of anybody you know, or anybody
you might have seen around.

13:05.652 --> 13:09.555
Sorry. Not really.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.274
Okay, I'll tell you what.

13:11.275 --> 13:12.775
If any of you guys
remember something...

13:12.776 --> 13:14.660
I mean, anything at
all comes to mind...

13:14.661 --> 13:16.061
I want you to give
me a call anytime.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.030
We'll get this guy.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.949
You just hear about this stuff.

13:19.950 --> 13:21.701
Never think it's going
to happen to you.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.873
You take good care of her.

13:26.874 --> 13:29.842
Yeah.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.627
Hey, sarge, I'm back.

13:31.628 --> 13:32.712
How'd you do?

13:32.713 --> 13:34.079
Yeah, you know,
I put the sketch out there.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.765
It's pretty generic.
You have any luck?

13:35.766 --> 13:36.883
A ground rule double.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.518
Video footage captures an escalade

13:38.519 --> 13:39.919
matching the description
in the area.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.755
We got a nice picture of
it rolling down Broadway,

13:42.756 --> 13:44.557
but we only got a
partial license plate.

13:44.558 --> 13:45.591
Anything pop at the DMV?

13:45.592 --> 13:48.427
Yeah, we got two real
strong possibles.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.263
We got a Vincent Harrah
of west 91st street

13:51.264 --> 13:52.899
and a Sofia Calso of park Avenue.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.651
West 91st street is about 15
blocks from the last attack.

13:55.652 --> 13:58.087
Yeah, Mr. Harrah has also been
a contestant with us before.

13:58.088 --> 14:00.490
Yeah, I see, uh,
he has two priors...

14:00.491 --> 14:02.291
possession of ecstasy
and domestic abuse.

14:02.292 --> 14:03.776
Yeah, I put out a finest message.

14:03.777 --> 14:05.878
Get every RMP looking for these
license plates. All right.

14:05.879 --> 14:09.131
I'm gonna go visit Mr. Harrah
and ring his bell.

14:13.637 --> 14:14.637
You have a problem, man?

14:14.638 --> 14:16.288
No, but you might.

14:29.636 --> 14:30.970
Hey, where you going?

14:31.304 --> 14:32.822
Hey!

14:34.324 --> 14:36.325
Good, now stay there;
I'll bring you some ice.

14:36.326 --> 14:38.244
Hey!

14:38.245 --> 14:40.246
If I catch you,
I'm gonna break your other leg!

15:00.166 --> 15:01.467
Come on.

15:02.836 --> 15:04.887
May I? Where you going? Come here.

15:07.691 --> 15:09.775
You arresting me?

15:09.776 --> 15:11.510
What did I do? Shut up and
get your hands in front.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.646
I didn't do anything. Is that why
you jumped out a window, huh?

15:13.647 --> 15:14.864
Is that why your car

15:14.865 --> 15:16.015
was at the scene of a rape

15:16.016 --> 15:17.033
last night? Rape?!

15:17.034 --> 15:18.284
I didn't rape anybody.

15:18.285 --> 15:19.485
I was at the yankee
game last night.

15:19.486 --> 15:22.521
Good, we'll get jeter on
the horn and find out.

15:37.107 --> 15:38.908
No, no, no,
we just collared our guy.

15:38.909 --> 15:40.326
Reagan.

15:40.327 --> 15:40.893
Yeah.

15:40.894 --> 15:42.245
Yeah!

15:42.246 --> 15:44.864
We gotta cut him loose.

15:44.865 --> 15:46.366
Who? Who?

15:46.367 --> 15:47.116
Vincent Harrah who.

15:47.117 --> 15:49.118
From the jumbotron video

15:49.119 --> 15:51.371
of last night's ball
game at yankee stadium.

15:51.372 --> 15:53.289
Your perp's alibi just checked out

15:53.290 --> 15:55.258
with 35,000 eyewitnesses.

15:55.259 --> 15:57.377
Says he only rabbited
'cause of the drug priors.

15:57.378 --> 15:59.212
Okay.

15:59.213 --> 16:01.848
What, no Reagan riot act?

16:01.849 --> 16:02.849
I guess it's your lucky day.

16:02.850 --> 16:03.967
I just hung up with the 17th.

16:03.968 --> 16:05.301
Two uniforms just pulled
over the other SUV

16:05.302 --> 16:08.137
with the partial plate match.

16:09.974 --> 16:13.059
Finally, captain,
thank you so much for coming.

16:13.060 --> 16:14.894
These idiots have
been keeping us here.

16:14.895 --> 16:16.279
Sofia Calso?

16:16.280 --> 16:19.365
Yes, do you have any idea what
the traffic is going to be like

16:19.366 --> 16:20.533
going out to the Hamptons now?

16:20.534 --> 16:21.868
No, actually, I have no idea.

16:21.869 --> 16:23.703
Um, is this your vehicle, ma'am?

16:23.704 --> 16:25.038
Yes, it's my vehicle.

16:25.039 --> 16:26.939
Would you mind telling
me what's going on?

16:26.940 --> 16:28.041
Because they wouldn't.

16:28.042 --> 16:29.575
Yeah. Were you using
this car last night?

16:29.576 --> 16:33.079
I was at the metropolitan museum
of art for a charity auction.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.497
I took a town car.

16:34.498 --> 16:36.249
Would you happen to
have the name and number

16:36.250 --> 16:37.333
of the car service you used?

16:37.334 --> 16:38.501
This is outrageous.

16:38.502 --> 16:40.553
Do you have any idea who I am?

16:40.554 --> 16:42.121
Sofia Calso.

16:42.122 --> 16:46.142
My husband is the deputy
counsel of Argentina.

16:46.143 --> 16:47.960
I have diplomatic immunity.

16:47.961 --> 16:49.929
You have no right to
stop and detain me.

16:49.930 --> 16:51.347
Is that what that little... yes.

16:51.348 --> 16:52.515
...Emblem means? Yes. Exactly.

16:52.516 --> 16:53.650
Nice. Precisely.

16:53.651 --> 16:55.401
Well, look,
a vehicle matching yours

16:55.402 --> 16:57.103
in make and model with
a similar license plate

16:57.104 --> 16:59.072
was involved in a series of
sexual assaults last night.

16:59.073 --> 17:00.806
Don't be ridiculous.
Would anyone else

17:00.807 --> 17:01.824
have had access to
this vehicle, ma'am?

17:01.825 --> 17:02.859
I've had enough of this.

17:02.860 --> 17:04.444
I'm not talking to
you people anymore.

17:05.579 --> 17:08.481
Some pretty fancy bumper
stickers back there.

17:08.482 --> 17:10.148
Your kids must go to
some nice schools.

17:10.150 --> 17:11.584
Yes, my daughter's a
freshman at brown,

17:11.585 --> 17:13.286
and my son is in college
here in New York.

17:13.287 --> 17:15.003
Are you finished?

17:15.005 --> 17:16.155
Yeah, for now.

17:16.156 --> 17:18.491
Thank you. Thank you.

17:18.492 --> 17:20.877
Have a great day.

17:26.633 --> 17:28.000
Sebastian Calso?

17:28.001 --> 17:29.018
Barney Miller?

17:29.019 --> 17:30.687
Ha. Yuk-yuk. That's good.

17:30.688 --> 17:31.771
Hey. Guess who's been tapped

17:31.772 --> 17:33.523
for open mic night
at central booking.

17:33.524 --> 17:35.141
Hey.

17:35.142 --> 17:37.226
I'm talking to you.

17:37.227 --> 17:39.178
I'm kind of busy with
classes right now.

17:39.179 --> 17:42.348
So I think, like, never, maybe.

17:42.349 --> 17:43.616
I think, like, now, maybe.

17:43.617 --> 17:45.017
I'll let my dad decide.

17:45.018 --> 17:46.685
Your dad?

17:46.686 --> 17:48.654
Officer?

17:49.490 --> 17:51.624
It's "detective," actually.

17:51.625 --> 17:54.127
Oh, of course. The business suit.

17:54.128 --> 17:55.128
Claudio Calso,

17:55.129 --> 17:57.163
deputy consul of Argentina.

17:57.164 --> 17:58.364
Well, Mr. deputy consul,

17:58.365 --> 18:00.199
I just came by to ask
Sebastian some questions

18:00.200 --> 18:01.534
about his whereabouts last night.

18:01.535 --> 18:04.087
His mother told me you
might be stopping by.

18:04.088 --> 18:05.638
But I'm afraid it
would be impossible

18:05.639 --> 18:07.173
for you to question him.

18:07.174 --> 18:09.058
Why is that? I am asserting

18:09.059 --> 18:10.143
his diplomatic immunity.

18:10.144 --> 18:12.512
Well, look, a violent
rape was committed

18:12.513 --> 18:14.180
within the proximity
of the school grounds.

18:14.181 --> 18:15.398
We know Sebastian's

18:15.399 --> 18:17.567
escalade was in the area,
so I just wanted to see

18:17.568 --> 18:18.935
if he'd seen anything.

18:18.936 --> 18:21.020
Sebastian?

18:22.389 --> 18:24.490
Apparently not.

18:24.491 --> 18:26.325
Okay, look...

18:26.326 --> 18:28.411
a woman was beaten and raped.

18:28.412 --> 18:30.496
And Sebastian shrugs
his shoulders,

18:30.497 --> 18:31.998
and that's "apparently not"?

18:31.999 --> 18:33.416
I do not like your tone,
detective.

18:33.417 --> 18:34.417
Well, forgive me.

18:34.418 --> 18:36.502
I never made it to
finishing school.

18:36.503 --> 18:38.004
This conversation is now over.

18:38.005 --> 18:41.674
Sebastian... take you out to lunch.

18:41.675 --> 18:43.843
Yuk-yuk.

18:48.515 --> 18:51.100
Lab report came back snake
eyes on the rape kit.

18:51.101 --> 18:53.019
They got a sample,
but no matches in the system.

18:53.020 --> 18:54.353
I gotta tell you, sarge,

18:54.354 --> 18:55.972
I'm really liking the
diplomat's kid for this.

18:55.973 --> 18:58.057
Well, right now, your case is
weaker than the mets bullpen.

18:58.058 --> 18:59.058
What do you mean, it's weak?

18:59.059 --> 19:00.309
You got a parking
sticker on a car.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.061
You got a rough sketch,
and you got a suspect

19:02.062 --> 19:05.031
with diplomatic immunity, which,
as you know, is absolute.

19:05.032 --> 19:07.033
It's not my fault I
can't talk to the kid.

19:07.034 --> 19:08.951
You got to take it up with one pp.

19:08.952 --> 19:10.102
They just called down.

19:10.103 --> 19:11.788
The commissioner has this.

19:11.789 --> 19:13.790
Sarge, if I could get in
this kid's apartment...

19:13.791 --> 19:15.324
the commissioner has this.

19:15.325 --> 19:17.076
Let those four words be

19:17.077 --> 19:19.245
the gospel according
to Gormley, okay?

19:19.246 --> 19:21.297
Get some sleep, Reagan.

19:21.298 --> 19:23.249
I like it better
when you fight back.

19:23.250 --> 19:24.417
Yeah, yeah.

19:32.559 --> 19:34.227
Deputy consul.

19:34.228 --> 19:35.428
Commissioner.

19:35.429 --> 19:36.596
Thanks for coming.

19:36.597 --> 19:38.014
Please, sit down.

19:39.733 --> 19:41.100
I was having some coffee.

19:41.101 --> 19:42.401
Would you like some?

19:42.402 --> 19:44.320
Yes, thank you.

19:44.321 --> 19:46.155
Actually, this isn't the
first time we've met.

19:46.156 --> 19:48.474
It was a few years ago
at Gracie mansion,

19:48.475 --> 19:51.310
back when I was
chief of department.

19:51.311 --> 19:52.445
Oh, yes.

19:52.446 --> 19:53.312
Of course.

19:53.313 --> 19:54.813
I was a police officer

19:54.814 --> 19:57.149
for over 30 years before I
became police commissioner,

19:57.150 --> 19:59.252
but I like to think of myself

19:59.253 --> 20:01.537
as a father first.

20:01.538 --> 20:04.090
Raised four kids.

20:04.091 --> 20:08.044
And I always let them know

20:08.045 --> 20:09.345
that they came before the job.

20:09.346 --> 20:10.429
Your coffee, sir.

20:10.430 --> 20:12.265
But I also let them know

20:12.266 --> 20:13.466
that if they had done wrong,

20:13.467 --> 20:15.601
that I would be as firm with them

20:15.602 --> 20:18.337
as I would any
lawbreaker on the street.

20:18.338 --> 20:21.774
That's admirable, commissioner.

20:21.775 --> 20:27.813
What I'm about to ask of you
is unimaginably difficult.

20:27.814 --> 20:30.182
But it is the right thing to do.

20:30.183 --> 20:33.402
I want you to waive
your son's immunity.

20:35.021 --> 20:38.457
Commissioner,
I've spoken with Sebastian.

20:38.458 --> 20:42.361
My son did not
commit these crimes.

20:42.362 --> 20:44.630
Then allow us to rule
him out as a suspect.

20:44.631 --> 20:46.883
Permit my detectives
to talk to him

20:46.884 --> 20:48.334
and take a DNA sample.

20:48.335 --> 20:49.418
I'm sorry, commissioner,

20:49.419 --> 20:51.254
but it would be bad precedent

20:51.255 --> 20:54.006
for me to breach
diplomatic protocol.

20:54.007 --> 20:55.308
I will not waive

20:55.309 --> 20:58.210
my son's immunity under
any circumstances.

20:58.211 --> 21:00.396
I understand.
Thank you for the coffee.

21:02.516 --> 21:03.482
Uh, if you like

21:03.483 --> 21:05.284
good coffee, you should try some

21:05.285 --> 21:08.104
of my country's boutique blends.

21:08.105 --> 21:10.907
I will send you some beans.

21:17.748 --> 21:21.367
Take it down to the lab.
They're expecting it.

21:36.249 --> 21:37.800
Every morning with this one.

21:37.801 --> 21:40.269
Eggs Benedict, eggs florentine...

21:40.270 --> 21:41.520
I'm up to here with eggs.

21:41.521 --> 21:43.139
I got eggs coming out of my ears.

21:43.140 --> 21:44.690
Whoa. Stop the car.

21:44.691 --> 21:45.891
What?

21:45.892 --> 21:47.393
There's something not
right about this guy.

21:47.394 --> 21:48.644
I'm shocked, Reagan.

21:48.645 --> 21:50.062
Shocked a Harvard guy like you

21:50.063 --> 21:51.263
is mocking the
vertically challenged.

21:51.264 --> 21:54.233
It's 85 degrees out.
Why is he wearing a coat?

21:54.234 --> 21:56.235
And why is it bulging?

21:56.236 --> 21:58.237
Okay. Good eye, Reagan.

22:10.917 --> 22:12.001
All right. Stop moving.

22:12.002 --> 22:13.970
Stop moving. All right.
Stop moving.

22:13.971 --> 22:15.621
Hey, Reagan, you're not
going to believe this.

22:15.622 --> 22:17.390
Look what this clown
just tossed. Huh?

22:17.391 --> 22:18.891
Congratulations, kid.

22:18.892 --> 22:20.259
You just caught your
first gun collar.

22:20.260 --> 22:22.561
You hear that? Let's go.

22:22.562 --> 22:24.630
This just in from
the lab at one pp.

22:26.733 --> 22:28.901
You know, I'm not exactly
a science major, sarge.

22:28.902 --> 22:30.653
What am I looking at here?
Brave new world.

22:30.654 --> 22:33.773
It's the DNA obtained from the
suspect's biological father.

22:33.774 --> 22:35.941
You know, from the coffee
cup in the commish's office.

22:35.942 --> 22:37.026
It's a partial match

22:37.027 --> 22:39.111
to the DNA from the rape victim,
Lauren Ryder.

22:39.112 --> 22:40.946
Okay, we got partial plates.

22:40.947 --> 22:43.315
We got partial DNA.
I'm partially happy. So what?

22:43.316 --> 22:45.117
It may not be the
suspect's own DNA,

22:45.118 --> 22:47.086
but it shows you've been
barking up the right tree.

22:47.087 --> 22:48.287
We still can't bust the kid.

22:48.288 --> 22:50.873
He's untouchable.

22:54.928 --> 22:57.129
DNA from the coffee cup?

22:57.130 --> 22:58.664
Smooth, dad.

22:58.665 --> 23:00.833
I try to stay in the game.

23:01.852 --> 23:04.587
So how do you think
it's going to play out?

23:04.588 --> 23:06.055
I don't know.

23:06.056 --> 23:08.691
The Mayor sent his partial
DNA match to Argentina,

23:08.692 --> 23:10.076
and we wait and see

23:10.077 --> 23:12.561
if they waive this kid's immunity.

23:12.562 --> 23:14.113
That would be nice.

23:14.114 --> 23:16.782
If they do.

23:16.783 --> 23:19.017
So?

23:19.018 --> 23:20.352
What?

23:20.353 --> 23:22.738
Lunch with my beautiful
daughter has been a tradition

23:22.739 --> 23:24.206
since you've been at the da's.

23:24.207 --> 23:26.492
Yeah, except for it's
3:00 in the afternoon,

23:26.493 --> 23:27.660
and not a Wednesday.

23:27.661 --> 23:30.996
Well, maybe I remembered

23:30.997 --> 23:35.835
that you second-seated a
diplomatic immunity case once.

23:37.587 --> 23:39.889
I'll poke around a little bit.

23:39.890 --> 23:44.977
See if I can find a way into,
around or over this thing.

23:44.978 --> 23:47.313
Always good to have
a plan b. Mm-hmm.

23:47.314 --> 23:48.514
And a beer. Mm.

23:48.515 --> 23:50.483
Kelly : Channel ten
news has learned

23:50.484 --> 23:52.685
that the NYPD does,
in fact, have a suspect...

23:52.686 --> 23:54.153
The Mayor went public with this?

23:54.154 --> 23:57.406
...Of university sex attacks,
but he is likely to walk

23:57.407 --> 23:59.608
and it is not for lack
of evidence. It's because

23:59.609 --> 24:02.828
he has a get-out-of-jail-free card-
diplomatic immunity.

24:02.829 --> 24:04.080
Now, we've also learned

24:04.081 --> 24:05.998
that the Mayor's office has
approached Argentina...

24:05.999 --> 24:07.533
First I heard about it.

24:09.119 --> 24:11.170
You agreed, Mr. Mayor,
to sit on this

24:11.171 --> 24:13.205
until Argentina
considered your request.

24:13.206 --> 24:15.925
Okay, for once, having 3,000
credentialed reporters

24:15.926 --> 24:17.877
in our city works in our favor.

24:17.878 --> 24:19.161
Embarrassing Argentina?

24:19.162 --> 24:21.130
That's a pretty
risky strategy. No.

24:21.131 --> 24:22.965
I mean, if they deny our request,

24:22.966 --> 24:24.967
then they are a cold
and heartless lot

24:24.968 --> 24:28.053
who don't care about the decent
citizens of this city like I do.

24:28.054 --> 24:30.222
At which point, it becomes the
state department's problem.

24:30.223 --> 24:32.057
All they can do is send him back.

24:32.058 --> 24:33.192
Where he becomes their problem.

24:33.193 --> 24:35.427
The point is,
he is no longer my problem.

24:35.428 --> 24:37.229
And the victim and her family?

24:37.230 --> 24:40.065
Since when do we bat
a thousand, Frank?

24:48.441 --> 24:50.543
Diplomatic immunity?

24:50.544 --> 24:51.944
It's complicated, Walter.

24:51.945 --> 24:53.162
Well, it shouldn't be.

24:53.163 --> 24:55.080
You know who did it,
you arrest him.

24:55.081 --> 24:57.500
Hey, I don't like it
anymore than you do, okay?

24:57.501 --> 24:58.918
But my hands are tied.

24:58.919 --> 25:01.303
I so much as ask this kid for the time,
and I get jammed up.

25:01.304 --> 25:02.805
Yeah, well, maybe I should
ask him for the time.

25:02.806 --> 25:04.423
Hey, I gonna pretend I
didn't hear you say that.

25:04.424 --> 25:06.342
My daughter is laying
in a hospital bed.

25:06.343 --> 25:07.560
Where's this kid?

25:07.561 --> 25:09.011
Sitting courtside at the Knicks?

25:09.012 --> 25:11.597
Walter, I know it doesn't make
any sense, but it's the law.

25:11.598 --> 25:13.566
No. You know what,
detective? It makes perfect sense.

25:13.567 --> 25:16.735
The diplomat gets to protect his kid,
not the electrician.

25:16.736 --> 25:20.239
Well, if you can't do
something about it, I will.

25:25.645 --> 25:26.645
I got a better idea.

25:26.646 --> 25:28.113
How about we round
up every diplomat

25:28.114 --> 25:30.666
in the city and send them back
to wherever they came from?

25:30.667 --> 25:31.917
I ever tell you about the time

25:31.918 --> 25:33.986
I had the Russian
ambassador's car towed

25:33.987 --> 25:35.153
to the south Bronx?

25:35.154 --> 25:36.872
A little glasnost
straight up his tailpipe.

25:36.873 --> 25:38.824
That little stunt put you

25:38.825 --> 25:41.343
in the doghouse with
Washington for a year, pop.

25:41.344 --> 25:43.762
Also put me in favor with
the rank and file for life.

25:43.763 --> 25:44.880
Yes, it did.

25:44.881 --> 25:46.164
Great grandpa was in a doghouse?

25:46.165 --> 25:47.766
It's an expression, stupid.
Linda: Okay, boys.

25:47.767 --> 25:48.934
Easy, Jack. Henry: Jack.

25:48.935 --> 25:50.603
I'm with Danny on this one.

25:50.604 --> 25:52.337
These people abuse
diplomatic privilege.

25:52.338 --> 25:54.273
They don't pay their parking
tickets, their rent.

25:54.274 --> 25:55.858
They scoff at our laws. Danny: Oh.

25:55.859 --> 25:57.109
I think that gun bust
might have knocked

25:57.110 --> 25:58.343
some sense into this kid.

25:58.344 --> 25:59.695
You're with Danny on this?

25:59.696 --> 26:00.980
I am.

26:00.981 --> 26:02.865
So what, Sydney?

26:02.866 --> 26:04.617
You think that spoiled dipstick
should get away with it?

26:04.618 --> 26:05.818
Of course not. Rape is heinous.

26:05.819 --> 26:06.819
I'd like to cut off

26:06.820 --> 26:07.953
the jerk's equipment myself.

26:07.954 --> 26:09.905
I just think you have

26:09.906 --> 26:11.123
a naive view of things.

26:11.124 --> 26:12.408
Oh, I'm naive, huh?

26:12.409 --> 26:13.959
Not that that should surprise me.

26:13.960 --> 26:15.244
Aw, Syd, come on. What?

26:15.245 --> 26:16.245
He's the only one who's allowed

26:16.246 --> 26:17.496
to have an opinion at the table?

26:17.497 --> 26:18.998
Whoa!

26:18.999 --> 26:20.466
And in this corner...

26:20.467 --> 26:22.134
a newcomer in the ring...

26:22.135 --> 26:23.702
Syd the kid.

26:23.703 --> 26:25.370
Oh, this is great. I get to spend

26:25.371 --> 26:27.423
another Sunday dinner with
some Ivy league attorney

26:27.424 --> 26:29.141
trying to open my eyes
to the real world.

26:29.142 --> 26:30.342
Okay. More Cranberries anyone?

26:30.343 --> 26:31.427
You back down now,

26:31.428 --> 26:33.045
he'll never let you
hear the end of it.

26:34.731 --> 26:37.516
Diplomatic immunity
may not be perfect,

26:37.517 --> 26:41.186
but it serves a purpose.

26:41.187 --> 26:43.221
Yeah. It helps rich
kids get away with rape.

26:43.222 --> 26:44.823
So what about American
diplomats abroad?

26:44.824 --> 26:46.742
They don't pay their
parking tickets either.

26:46.743 --> 26:48.494
I'm talking about
the female diplomat

26:48.495 --> 26:50.896
in the middle east
who ends up in jail

26:50.897 --> 26:53.065
because she wears
inappropriate garb

26:53.066 --> 26:55.301
and doesn't have
diplomatic immunity.

26:55.302 --> 26:57.086
Do you really want our ambassadors

26:57.087 --> 26:59.088
in tenuous countries
to be subject...

26:59.089 --> 27:00.923
...To trumped up charges,
thrown in jail,

27:00.924 --> 27:04.793
and used as pawns in a
diplomatic game of chicken?

27:04.794 --> 27:07.412
The world's a lot bigger than
the five boroughs, Danny.

27:07.413 --> 27:08.797
Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't get

27:08.798 --> 27:11.016
to spend my junior
year abroad like you.

27:11.017 --> 27:13.085
I had my hands full in fallujah.

27:13.086 --> 27:15.521
Well, Argentina turned us down.

27:15.522 --> 27:16.972
They're not going
to waive immunity.

27:16.973 --> 27:19.024
Excuse me.

27:20.694 --> 27:22.895
Great.

27:26.865 --> 27:28.749
That's just what your
friend the Mayor wanted.

27:28.750 --> 27:30.067
He's not my friend.

27:30.068 --> 27:31.752
Now he's gonna call
the state department

27:31.753 --> 27:33.788
and have that kid's butt
shipped back to Argentina.

27:33.789 --> 27:35.773
He rapes somebody, and we give
him a first-class ticket home.

27:35.774 --> 27:37.208
I'll tell you what.

27:37.209 --> 27:39.210
I ain't letting that kid walk.
Erin: I'm here.

27:39.211 --> 27:40.211
I'm here.

27:40.212 --> 27:41.329
You better have a
pretty good reason

27:41.330 --> 27:42.296
for missing dinner, missy.

27:42.297 --> 27:43.748
She might. Erin: Of course

27:43.749 --> 27:44.999
I had to had to
pull judge Barthell

27:45.000 --> 27:46.284
from his son's holy
communion party.

27:46.285 --> 27:48.302
What were you doing with Barthell?

27:48.303 --> 27:49.720
Getting this.

28:00.399 --> 28:02.483
What is it?

28:02.484 --> 28:03.818
It's a material witness order.

28:03.819 --> 28:06.187
Your vehicle was used in the
commission of a b felony.

28:06.188 --> 28:07.638
First degree rape, in this case.

28:07.639 --> 28:09.440
So, the city of New York says

28:09.441 --> 28:11.158
I can take you into custody now.

28:11.159 --> 28:12.660
I beg your pardon.
Danny: I beg your pardon.

28:12.661 --> 28:14.612
Please don't make this any more
fun for me than it already is.

28:14.613 --> 28:15.663
Okay, sport?

28:15.664 --> 28:17.615
And my diplomatic immunity?
Oh, yeah.

28:17.616 --> 28:18.983
Excuse me. Yeah, that. Mm.

28:18.984 --> 28:20.534
Well, that actually
went out the window

28:20.535 --> 28:21.869
the minute you
divorced your husband,

28:21.870 --> 28:23.788
which of course,
you failed to disclose to us.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.155
Did she disclose that to you?

28:25.156 --> 28:28.042
So, now, you're gonna come
down with me to central booking

28:28.043 --> 28:29.710
where you can hang
out with the likes

28:29.711 --> 28:31.178
of the drug addicts
and the prostitutes

28:31.179 --> 28:33.381
and the other unsavory types
who tend to hang out there.

28:33.382 --> 28:35.466
Until such time, of course,
as you can get your son

28:35.467 --> 28:36.934
to come down and
give me an interview.

28:36.935 --> 28:38.369
Which I'm sure won't
take too long,

28:38.370 --> 28:39.687
since you control his trust fund.

28:39.688 --> 28:42.556
Shall we go?

28:48.180 --> 28:49.780
Enjoy your lunch.

28:51.700 --> 28:53.868
Shall we?

29:18.593 --> 29:20.594
Get him in the car.

29:20.595 --> 29:21.712
Right away.

29:21.713 --> 29:23.931
What are you doing? Hey! Hey!

29:23.932 --> 29:25.149
What are you doing, Walter?

29:25.150 --> 29:26.884
What are you doing, huh?

29:26.885 --> 29:28.069
No, I'm just sightseeing, that's all.
Sightseeing, huh?

29:28.070 --> 29:29.353
Yeah. If I pat you down,
that bulge

29:29.354 --> 29:32.356
in your pocket's gonna be,
what, a camera, huh?

29:32.357 --> 29:33.741
You understand that criminal
possession of a firearm

29:33.742 --> 29:34.775
is a c felony, right, Walter?

29:34.776 --> 29:35.743
You're a father.

29:35.744 --> 29:37.278
You try to imagine
how little I care

29:37.279 --> 29:38.779
about what happens
to me right now.

29:38.780 --> 29:40.114
Hey, hey, hey. What about Lauren?

29:40.115 --> 29:41.398
You care what happens to her?

29:41.399 --> 29:44.368
Walter, if I put my hands on you,
and that camera's

29:44.369 --> 29:46.203
not a camera, she's gonna
be visiting you upstate

29:46.204 --> 29:47.455
for the next three years.

29:47.456 --> 29:49.123
You think that's gonna make
this any better for her?

29:49.124 --> 29:50.291
So I'm supposed to do nothing?

29:50.292 --> 29:52.126
Then what, detective?
You tell me. Huh?

29:52.127 --> 29:53.761
Next semester, when she...

29:53.762 --> 29:55.412
She shows up for biology class,

29:55.413 --> 29:58.415
this animal is sitting
next to her? Huh?

29:58.416 --> 30:00.101
That can't happen.

30:00.102 --> 30:01.552
No, this cannot happen.

30:01.553 --> 30:03.137
Now, you do yourself a favor.
You walk down

30:03.138 --> 30:04.889
to that river,
you find a nice, quiet spot,

30:04.890 --> 30:06.440
and you drop your little
nine millimeter Nikon

30:06.441 --> 30:07.608
into the water, okay?

30:07.609 --> 30:09.193
Hey!

30:09.194 --> 30:10.861
You don't do that,

30:10.862 --> 30:13.647
I'm gonna be locking up
a good man here today.

30:16.034 --> 30:18.602
I'll take care of this
piece of crap. Go.

30:18.603 --> 30:20.488
Go!

30:29.581 --> 30:31.115
Whew... where are these people?

30:31.116 --> 30:33.117
It's hot as hell in here.

30:34.386 --> 30:36.670
Sorry to keep you waiting.

30:36.671 --> 30:38.222
A little shorthanded here.

30:38.223 --> 30:39.390
Mind moving your jacket, please?

30:39.391 --> 30:40.641
As you know, detective,

30:40.642 --> 30:42.309
my client has agreed
to this interview,

30:42.310 --> 30:44.628
but he is in no way
waiving his immunity.

30:44.629 --> 30:45.763
Right. That's fine.

30:45.764 --> 30:47.565
How about we start the
interview with, uh,

30:47.566 --> 30:48.849
you taking off your sunglasses?

30:48.850 --> 30:50.518
How about I think about it?

30:50.519 --> 30:51.735
No.

30:51.736 --> 30:52.987
Okay. Suit yourself.

30:52.988 --> 30:54.471
I only have a few questions.

30:54.472 --> 30:56.323
And I have one of my own.

30:56.324 --> 30:59.309
Air conditioning?
Have you ever heard of it? Yeah.

30:59.310 --> 31:01.112
They haven't fixed that,
have they? Geez. Yeah.

31:01.113 --> 31:02.329
It's been off and on lately.

31:02.330 --> 31:03.647
I've been complaining
for weeks myself.

31:03.648 --> 31:05.366
I can see you have
a lot of pull. Huh.

31:05.367 --> 31:07.818
Yeah. All right,
let's get started.

31:07.819 --> 31:10.638
Where were you on the
night of the 16th?

31:10.639 --> 31:12.590
St. Tropez.

31:12.591 --> 31:15.709
Uh, no. Wait. Cancun.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.762
No, that was two weeks ago.

31:18.763 --> 31:20.681
: I'm not really sure.

31:20.682 --> 31:22.133
Bali?

31:22.134 --> 31:24.668
He's funny.

31:24.669 --> 31:26.971
You think it's funny a
young girl got raped, huh?

31:26.972 --> 31:28.105
No, I think it's funny

31:28.106 --> 31:29.473
that you think I need
to get mine that way.

31:29.474 --> 31:30.641
I don't think anything.

31:30.642 --> 31:31.859
The evidence speaks for itself.

31:31.860 --> 31:33.727
Your vehicle was
at the crime scene,

31:33.728 --> 31:34.979
victim I.D.'D you,

31:34.980 --> 31:36.947
and I'd be willing
to bet my salary,

31:36.948 --> 31:39.900
if you took a DNA test,
it'd be all over that girl.

31:39.901 --> 31:42.870
It's a good thing I'm smart
enough not to take that bet.

31:42.871 --> 31:45.189
Despite the temptation of
winning a whole $40,000.

31:45.190 --> 31:47.074
Hm. Yeah, well,

31:47.075 --> 31:49.860
fortunately, I'm
compensated in other ways.

31:49.861 --> 31:52.496
Like when I get to
see the look of love

31:52.497 --> 31:53.714
in a meat-wrangler's eye

31:53.715 --> 31:56.750
the day I make some spoiled
rich kid his new cellie.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.838
That's a nice tattoo
you got there.

32:00.839 --> 32:02.873
Let's get out of here.

32:05.393 --> 32:08.179
Help yourself.

32:12.400 --> 32:13.884
Nice tie.

32:17.105 --> 32:18.388
Oh. Did it work?

32:18.389 --> 32:19.857
Yeah. Don't touch anything.

32:19.858 --> 32:22.693
He put his sweaty hands all
over the doorknob there;

32:22.694 --> 32:24.945
he's got some drips over here
and look at the table, too.

32:24.946 --> 32:26.947
Puts a new spin on the
term to sweat someone.

32:26.948 --> 32:28.582
Yeah, but I got a
question for you.

32:28.583 --> 32:30.451
Why does the boyfriend
of one of our victims

32:30.452 --> 32:33.204
have the same exact tattoo
on his arm as this rapist?

32:38.911 --> 32:40.111
Tell me about it.

32:40.112 --> 32:41.412
It's wolf and key.

32:41.413 --> 32:45.550
The name of a sort of
exclusive club at school.

32:45.551 --> 32:47.552
Like a fraternity?

32:47.553 --> 32:49.837
It's private, secret.

32:49.838 --> 32:52.289
No one's supposed
to know about it.

32:52.290 --> 32:55.093
And... they only tap
five freshmen a year.

32:55.094 --> 32:57.428
We've had a president, senators...

32:57.429 --> 32:59.463
Even Supreme court justices.

32:59.464 --> 33:00.898
That explains why
Sebastian kissed in,

33:00.899 --> 33:02.967
but what about you,
what's your excuse?

33:02.968 --> 33:04.802
Your old man's a
schoolteacher from yonkers.

33:04.803 --> 33:07.355
How'd you get in?
I'm captain of the football team.

33:07.356 --> 33:09.440
Oh. Got to have one
of those, right?

33:09.441 --> 33:11.359
You know how the world works.

33:11.360 --> 33:13.277
I don't know how that world works.

33:13.278 --> 33:15.863
Why don't you enlighten me.

33:18.417 --> 33:20.969
You're either them
or you're not them.

33:20.970 --> 33:22.170
Mm-hmm.

33:22.171 --> 33:25.289
Wolf and key can open up
a lot of doors for me.

33:28.544 --> 33:30.561
Look...

33:30.562 --> 33:32.547
I'm not Brett Favre.

33:32.548 --> 33:36.000
I had no future in
professional football.

33:36.001 --> 33:38.102
Come on, a girl like Courtney?

33:38.103 --> 33:40.438
A girl like Courtney.

33:40.439 --> 33:42.173
Your girlfriend...

33:42.174 --> 33:44.142
that's the part that I don't get.

33:44.143 --> 33:45.643
I've seen you two together.

33:45.644 --> 33:49.013
You look very happy.
She's a very beautiful girl.

33:49.014 --> 33:50.948
But you knew Sebastian.

33:50.949 --> 33:53.951
You knew he attacked her-
why didn't you come forward?

33:58.991 --> 34:01.209
You'd protect a guy who'd
attack your girlfriend?

34:03.028 --> 34:04.829
I don't know, he...

34:04.830 --> 34:06.247
You don't know what?

34:06.248 --> 34:07.715
He attacked your girlfriend.

34:07.716 --> 34:10.485
He didn't attack her.

34:11.536 --> 34:14.722
What do you mean,
he didn't attack her?

34:16.875 --> 34:18.976
If he didn't attack
your girlfriend,

34:18.976 --> 34:20.311
then who did?

34:24.183 --> 34:25.817
Hey. Hey.

34:25.818 --> 34:27.185
Who attacked your girlfriend?

34:27.186 --> 34:29.353
Who did it?!

34:31.857 --> 34:33.524
I did.

34:39.563 --> 34:41.282
Wow.

34:41.283 --> 34:43.067
You attacked your girlfriend.

34:43.068 --> 34:45.703
It was just supposed
to be a prank. Prank?

34:45.704 --> 34:48.005
This year's initiation.

34:48.005 --> 34:50.373
You attacked your girlfriend
as part of a hazing?

34:50.375 --> 34:51.842
Sebastian dreamed it up.

34:51.844 --> 34:54.128
The hottie hit list.

34:55.848 --> 34:57.765
The five hottest girls on campus.

34:57.766 --> 35:01.052
Yeah. We'd ride around
with senior members,

35:01.053 --> 35:03.221
and when we got their panties...

35:03.222 --> 35:05.022
We'd check their name off.

35:05.023 --> 35:06.607
So you pantsed her.

35:06.608 --> 35:08.276
Your own girlfriend. I thought

35:08.277 --> 35:10.728
at least I'd be careful
and she wouldn't get hurt.

35:10.729 --> 35:13.030
Right, 'cause chivalry's
not dead with you.

35:13.031 --> 35:15.233
So now it's Sebastian's turn.

35:15.234 --> 35:18.569
You and your buddies,
you're all in the car.

35:18.570 --> 35:20.037
What'd you do?

35:20.038 --> 35:21.289
Hmm?

35:21.290 --> 35:22.457
Did you watch?

35:22.458 --> 35:24.792
You watch him rape that
innocent... to verify.

35:24.793 --> 35:25.943
To verify what?!

35:25.944 --> 35:28.096
We didn't know he
was gonna rape her!

35:28.097 --> 35:30.047
We didn't!

35:30.048 --> 35:31.833
He went nuts.

35:31.834 --> 35:35.470
He went nuts, and the rest of
you sat around and you watched?

35:36.288 --> 35:38.723
That makes you all part of it now.

35:38.724 --> 35:41.592
That makes you all future
masters of the universe

35:41.593 --> 35:43.294
accessories to aggravated rape.

35:43.295 --> 35:46.147
You know, kid, you wanted
to be just like them.

35:46.148 --> 35:49.817
Well, congratulations, you are.

36:04.199 --> 36:06.417
Lock 'em all up.

36:06.418 --> 36:07.919
Bring 'em all.

36:07.920 --> 36:09.954
Let's go.

36:12.257 --> 36:14.959
Any other day we lock up
50 degenerate rich kids,

36:14.960 --> 36:16.928
I'm howling to the moon.

36:16.929 --> 36:18.829
But with this mutt Sebastian
still on the loose...

36:18.830 --> 36:20.348
I gotta roll.

36:20.349 --> 36:23.667
Lab just hit a bull's-eye
on the DNA from my doorknob.

36:23.668 --> 36:25.019
Get ready to start howling.

36:25.020 --> 36:26.220
Hey!

36:26.221 --> 36:28.055
I'll be back for you!

36:38.016 --> 36:40.484
I don't know, Kelly.

36:41.519 --> 36:44.872
I just don't think we
should see each other.

36:47.793 --> 36:49.377
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

36:49.378 --> 36:50.962
Five minutes... I do not want

36:50.963 --> 36:53.798
to miss the beginning
of la boheme.

36:54.583 --> 36:56.551
Sit down.

36:58.887 --> 37:00.371
Four minutes.

37:00.372 --> 37:03.540
As you know, your son came
into the NYPD for an interview.

37:03.541 --> 37:05.226
Seems that our
air-conditioning was broken...

37:05.227 --> 37:06.727
Three minutes.

37:06.728 --> 37:08.980
What Baker was about to say,
Claudio,

37:08.981 --> 37:13.000
is your son dripped his
DNA all over the room.

37:13.001 --> 37:14.202
Forensics compared his sample

37:14.203 --> 37:16.053
with those taken from
the victim as part

37:16.054 --> 37:17.772
of the rape kit performed
after the attack.

37:19.557 --> 37:21.892
That's a perfect match, Claudio.

37:24.062 --> 37:29.317
Commissioner, despite what your
evidence may or may not show,

37:29.318 --> 37:31.002
it is immaterial.

37:31.003 --> 37:33.904
My son remains protected under

37:33.905 --> 37:35.873
diplomatic immunity.

37:35.874 --> 37:36.958
That's true.

37:36.959 --> 37:39.060
He is protected...

37:39.061 --> 37:41.078
Here.

37:41.079 --> 37:42.680
NYPD forwarded

37:42.681 --> 37:44.765
Sebastian Calso's DNA profile

37:44.766 --> 37:45.933
to officials in Argentina.

37:45.934 --> 37:48.135
Specifically, the Buenos
Aires police department.

37:48.136 --> 37:50.187
It was run against
evidence collected

37:50.188 --> 37:52.589
in the rape and beating
of a 19-year-old

37:52.590 --> 37:54.992
Buenos Aires student last summer.

37:57.195 --> 38:00.648
I'm afraid that, too, is a match.

38:04.769 --> 38:06.037
Oh, God.

38:06.038 --> 38:09.540
Our state department will give
your son 24 hours to return

38:09.541 --> 38:13.411
to Argentina, where he will
be tried for that crime,

38:13.412 --> 38:16.480
and he will be convicted
and sent to Mendoza.

38:16.481 --> 38:18.615
Mendoza prison is your
country's most notorious...

38:18.616 --> 38:19.884
I know.

38:19.885 --> 38:21.969
I know of Mendoza.

38:21.970 --> 38:23.638
Of course, you could decide

38:23.639 --> 38:25.139
to waive your son's immunity,

38:25.140 --> 38:28.059
allow NYPD detectives
to take him into custody

38:28.060 --> 38:30.561
and risk a fair trial here.

38:30.562 --> 38:34.065
He is my son, commissioner.

38:34.066 --> 38:37.451
And the girl he raped is
another man's daughter.

38:39.971 --> 38:42.156
Oh, time's up.

38:43.141 --> 38:45.642
On your way to the opera,

38:45.643 --> 38:48.946
call your son and
explain it to him.

39:06.581 --> 39:09.183
So, what are you doing

39:12.504 --> 39:15.389
Sydney's pulling an
all-nighter at the law firm.

39:15.390 --> 39:17.058
Ah.

39:17.859 --> 39:19.610
I don't know, I guess I just...

39:19.611 --> 39:22.196
Had an urge to look at
some of these old pictures.

39:23.648 --> 39:25.149
So, how's it been,

39:25.150 --> 39:26.567
first few weeks on the job?

39:26.568 --> 39:28.319
Every time I do something,

39:28.320 --> 39:31.205
my sergeant tells me how I
should've done it differently.

39:32.491 --> 39:35.559
And then I think about
what Danny would've done,

39:35.560 --> 39:38.212
and that's something else.

39:39.214 --> 39:43.334
Good cops are made by
the world they police.

39:43.335 --> 39:48.372
I was the kind of cop I
needed to be in my time,

39:48.373 --> 39:51.592
so was your dad, so was Danny.

39:53.378 --> 39:57.648
Now your dad runs the city,
and Danny's...

39:57.649 --> 39:59.934
Adapting to the changes,

39:59.935 --> 40:02.052
and I'm a dinosaur.

40:03.522 --> 40:05.506
Listen to your sergeant.

40:05.507 --> 40:08.109
Become your own kind of good cop.

40:12.914 --> 40:15.416
I've seen that picture before.

40:15.417 --> 40:16.584
Which?

40:16.585 --> 40:18.169
What's that pin?

40:18.170 --> 40:20.938
The templar.

40:20.939 --> 40:22.757
I told you about that.

40:22.758 --> 40:24.875
I didn't know Danny was one.
Yeah, he joined.

40:24.876 --> 40:27.294
It was a different thing by then.

40:27.295 --> 40:28.596
Different how?

40:33.435 --> 40:36.487
In my day, we formed the
templar for a reason...

40:36.488 --> 40:38.255
to clean up the department.

40:38.256 --> 40:41.058
After the job was done,

40:41.059 --> 40:43.694
it became just another club...

40:43.695 --> 40:45.863
drinking and war stories.

40:45.864 --> 40:48.599
You know what?

40:48.600 --> 40:50.951
That's more dinosaur talk.

40:52.571 --> 40:55.372
Let's see what
happened with the jets.

41:06.134 --> 41:08.469
Step back. Step aside.

41:08.470 --> 41:09.920
Hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:09.921 --> 41:11.172
Hold on, hold on.

41:11.173 --> 41:13.507
Let's see, something's
not quite right.

41:15.594 --> 41:17.812
Oh, yeah, there we go.

41:17.813 --> 41:19.630
What's the matter,
you got no jokes today?

41:19.631 --> 41:20.797
Step aside.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.234
How's she doing?

41:23.235 --> 41:24.568
She's gonna be okay.

41:24.569 --> 41:25.736
He's not.

41:38.099 --> 41:40.451
Hey, Francis.

41:40.452 --> 41:43.120
Special delivery.

41:43.121 --> 41:45.873
Where'd you get this?

41:45.874 --> 41:47.208
Found it on the stoop.

41:47.209 --> 41:49.293
There's a card.

41:50.462 --> 41:51.929
They're your favorite kind.

41:51.930 --> 41:53.180
Who are they from?

41:53.181 --> 41:55.299
The Mayor.

41:55.300 --> 41:56.350
Ooh.

41:56.351 --> 41:57.935
Don't mind if I do.

41:57.936 --> 41:59.720
Speaking of our civic leader...

41:59.721 --> 42:02.673
Uh-oh. Oh, here he goes.

42:02.674 --> 42:04.725
...It's a victory for
the city of New York.

42:04.726 --> 42:06.610
I'm just happy that the
government of Argentina

42:06.611 --> 42:08.395
heeded my advice and
did the right thing.

42:09.364 --> 42:11.198
A weasel. Yeah.

42:11.199 --> 42:13.901
Dad does all the work,
and the Mayor takes the credit?

42:13.902 --> 42:16.654
Sounds familiar. If you're
looking for a pat on the back,

42:16.655 --> 42:18.122
don't become a cop.

42:18.123 --> 42:19.957
Aw.

42:19.958 --> 42:21.525
Good job, dad.

42:21.526 --> 42:22.543
Yeah, good job, dad.

42:22.544 --> 42:24.528
Good job, son.

42:27.332 --> 42:29.550
Don't smoke that in the house.

42:29.750 --> 42:39.950
