00:01.213 --> 00:04.967
# Gotta find my corner

00:06.013 --> 00:10.165
# Of the sky

00:10.253 --> 00:13.370
All right! All right!

00:15.613 --> 00:19.925
Thanks. Another great performance.
But open mic night is just beginning.

00:20.013 --> 00:25.133
So let's hear it for the beautiful and persistent
Emma von Helberg.

00:25.213 --> 00:28.125
All right, Emma!

00:28.213 --> 00:31.410
# Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh, whoa

00:31.493 --> 00:36.123
# I'm a slave for you

00:36.213 --> 00:39.603
# I cannot hold it, I cannot control it

00:39.693 --> 00:44.209
# I'm a slave for you

00:44.293 --> 00:47.410
# But I'll return, so don't you worry

00:47.493 --> 00:49.529
# Working nine to five

00:49.613 --> 00:51.763
# What a way to make a living

00:51.853 --> 00:53.809
# Barely getting by

00:53.893 --> 00:56.088
# It's all taking and no giving

00:56.773 --> 01:00.448
# If we could talk to the animals, cookie
Learn their languages

01:00.533 --> 01:03.047
# Maybe take an animal degree

01:03.133 --> 01:06.603
# This time, this place

01:06.693 --> 01:10.129
# Misused, mistakes

01:10.213 --> 01:13.967
# Too long, too late

01:14.053 --> 01:17.045
# Who was I to make you wait?

01:17.133 --> 01:21.251
# Just one chance, just one breath

01:21.333 --> 01:24.131
# Just in case there's just one left

01:24.213 --> 01:28.252
# Cos you know, you know

01:28.333 --> 01:31.643
# You know

01:31.733 --> 01:35.487
# That I love you

01:35.573 --> 01:38.531
# I loved you all along

01:38.613 --> 01:42.083
# And I miss you

01:42.173 --> 01:45.609
# Been far away for far too long

01:45.693 --> 01:50.767
# I keep dreaming you'll be with me

01:50.853 --> 01:53.003
# And never go

01:53.093 --> 01:55.482
# Stop breathing

01:55.573 --> 02:01.728
# If I don't see you any more

02:07.293 --> 02:10.045
All right. Up next,
another Checkerbox regular -

02:10.133 --> 02:13.762
the smooth and smoky voice
of Chris Calabasa.

02:14.933 --> 02:20.291
- You should've left that song in the shower.
- I couldn't listen to you butcher it again.

02:20.373 --> 02:24.730
-  All right, Chris!
- Bastard took my tune. Play "Piano Man".

02:24.813 --> 02:26.531
That's original.

02:34.333 --> 02:38.645
# It's nine o'clock on a Saturday

02:38.733 --> 02:41.566
# The regular crowd shuffles in

02:42.333 --> 02:46.121
# There's an old man sitting next to me

02:46.213 --> 02:50.172
# Making love to his tonic and gin

02:50.253 --> 02:54.246
# Sing us a song, you're the piano man

02:54.333 --> 02:57.882
# Sing us a song tonight

02:57.973 --> 03:01.761
# Well, we're all in the mood for a melody...

03:04.253 --> 03:06.926
Every bone appears to be broken.

03:08.653 --> 03:11.372
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

03:11.453 --> 03:15.128
Pelvic fragments suggest it's a male.

03:15.573 --> 03:18.007
- Are you OK?
- Thank you, fine. Just...

03:18.093 --> 03:23.372
Particles from the cut grass are causing his
mast cells to release inflammatory mediators.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.409
- It's allergies.
- That's what I said.

03:25.493 --> 03:28.132
Given the decomp,
he's been dead a couple of weeks.

03:28.213 --> 03:30.443
- Body dump?
- Lividity's indeterminate.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.012
Oh.

03:32.093 --> 03:36.166
How does a sniper have a grass allergy?
A sneeze would give away your position.

03:36.253 --> 03:39.609
Bones, OK, I worked in the desert.
It was sand, no grass.

03:39.693 --> 03:41.809
The crunching got my attention.

03:41.893 --> 03:45.044
- Did you see the body before it crunched?
- It's not my fault.

03:45.133 --> 03:48.569
Johnson grass is 8ft high and dense.
It's like driving in the dark.

03:48.653 --> 03:51.565
- Wow. You must've been driving fast.
- I had a date.

03:51.653 --> 03:56.408
I wanted to get home to shower. She's
probably still waiting at the falafel place.

03:56.493 --> 04:00.008
Johnson grass lets off a ton of pollen.
Your eyes could swell up.

04:00.093 --> 04:02.687
- If your throat closes...
- Allergies. I'm fine.

04:02.773 --> 04:05.924
You didn't by any chance
see a head, did you?

04:06.013 --> 04:09.244
- The head's missing?
- I don't see it or any skull fragments.

04:09.333 --> 04:12.564
- Sorry.
- Well, I've got some brain matter here.

04:12.653 --> 04:16.009
So he had to have a head at some point.

04:19.892 --> 04:23.329
- Found it.
- My date's not gonna believe this.

04:23.413 --> 04:26.325
The blade must've severed
just below the C5 vertebra

04:26.413 --> 04:30.167
and the force of the impact
propelled the head into the grill.

04:30.253 --> 04:35.452
So presumably he was killed,
decapitated, and mulched.

04:35.533 --> 04:39.162
Wow. Could it get any worse for this guy?

04:41.000 --> 04:47.074

05:15.013 --> 05:17.846
The bones are dense
with a high degree of robusticity.

05:17.933 --> 05:20.811
That's consistent with his musculature.

05:20.893 --> 05:24.124
He was probably an athlete.
I bet he was hot.

05:24.213 --> 05:26.408
Yeah. Well, now he's really not.

05:26.493 --> 05:30.008
- I think he had a cold.
- Looks like it was a pretty bad one.

05:30.093 --> 05:34.405
I found traces of tea and honey in his
stomach and the remains of a throat lozenge.

05:34.493 --> 05:38.486
Oh, wow. The victim's watch.
It's totally cool.

05:38.573 --> 05:43.363
- Measures heart rate, calories burned, speed.
- Jock. I rest my case.

05:43.453 --> 05:46.525
The gym is bad enough
without getting yelled at by a watch.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.922
My regimen is completed
in my apartment.

05:49.013 --> 05:52.403
Treadmill for 30 minutes,
100 sit-ups, push-ups and leg lifts,

05:52.493 --> 05:56.008
and 20 minutes of free weights.
I'm deceptively strong.

05:56.093 --> 05:58.482
- I'm deceived.
-  Odontology got a match.

05:58.573 --> 06:00.404
Tommy Sour.

06:00.493 --> 06:03.451
He was reported missing two weeks ago.

06:09.453 --> 06:12.331
- I hear someone in there.
- Hey, break down the door.

06:12.413 --> 06:14.973
It hurts my shoulder
when I break down the door.

06:16.493 --> 06:18.563
What is that annoying noise?

06:18.653 --> 06:20.530
You donâ€™t just walk in...

06:20.613 --> 06:23.081
I'm sorry. I had my earplugs in.
Can I help you?

06:23.173 --> 06:28.201
FBI Special Agent Booth. This is Dr Brennan.
You reported Tommy Sour missing?

06:28.293 --> 06:32.684
- A couple of weeks ago. He lives next door.
- Can we come in?

06:32.773 --> 06:37.893
- Excuse the mess. I've got a show in a month.
- You're influenced by the neo-expressionists.

06:37.973 --> 06:42.922
Don't even look at that. That is crap.
There it goes again! I can't focus.

06:43.013 --> 06:46.801
That alarm has been beeping every
two minutes since Tommy went missing.

06:46.893 --> 06:49.965
- That is annoying.
- That's why I've got the earplugs.

06:50.053 --> 06:52.931
I asked the cops to unplug it.
Maybe you guys could.

06:53.013 --> 06:57.609
- Mr Matthews, Tommy Sour is dead.
- Oh, God.

06:57.693 --> 07:00.685
Was there anything unusual
about his behaviour?

07:00.773 --> 07:03.765
- I didn't know him well.
- You reported him missing.

07:03.853 --> 07:08.165
His mail started piling up on his front door.
And then that damn alarm clock.

07:08.253 --> 07:11.882
- It's driving me crazy.
- This sculpture is very impressive.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.168
It's from my pre-alarm-clock period.

07:14.253 --> 07:16.892
What about strangers?
Any new faces around here?

07:16.973 --> 07:19.885
- Oh, wait, yeah. Fat Pam.
- Excuse me?

07:19.973 --> 07:24.569
- Fat Pam. She was one of Tommy's clients.
- I thought you didn't know him that well.

07:24.653 --> 07:26.245
He was my neighbour.

07:26.333 --> 07:30.963
If we took the garbage out, we saw each other,
we'd talk a bit. You know what it's like.

07:31.053 --> 07:35.410
Anyway, Tommy was Fat Pam's trainer
at, um, Valera Wellness.

07:35.493 --> 07:38.291
- Must you call her Fat Pam?
- That's what he called her.

07:38.373 --> 07:41.331
It's not like Tommy was the nicest guy
who ever lived.

07:41.413 --> 07:44.325
- She wasn't all that fat, even.
- You mean overweight.

07:44.413 --> 07:47.564
Fat is a deposit beneath the skin.
It consists of lipids.

07:47.653 --> 07:52.647
Pam just wasn't one of those fitness robots
that Tommy would spend his time with.

07:52.733 --> 07:57.363
She started following Tommy home.
She'd sit out on the kerb and watch his place.

07:57.453 --> 08:01.731
About a month ago she showed up, middle
of the night, started banging on his door.

08:01.813 --> 08:04.008
Oh, was she angry?

08:04.093 --> 08:09.121
She was wearing a teddy and heels, so
I'm thinking angry wasn't her prime emotion.

08:09.213 --> 08:12.011
You're implying
that she was sexually stimulated.

08:12.093 --> 08:17.565
- So, were they, um... You know, did they?
- Did they have sexual intercourse?

08:17.653 --> 08:21.282
- If they did, it was through a locked door.
- So... no?

08:21.853 --> 08:24.242
- Very good. Let's go.
- Why are you clapping?

08:24.333 --> 08:26.164
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:26.253 --> 08:29.404
Maybe you could go turn the alarm off?
Or just shoot it?

08:29.493 --> 08:33.168
C5, just under the hyoid,
seems to be shaved on its front.

08:33.253 --> 08:36.051
- Shaved?
- Yes, like with a cheese slicer.

08:36.133 --> 08:39.727
- Must mean someone slit his throat.
- This wasn't caused by a knife.

08:39.813 --> 08:42.645
There are no serrations,
even microscopic.

08:42.732 --> 08:44.530
What, then?

08:44.613 --> 08:49.641
A cheese slicer seems illogical under
the circumstances. I'll look for alternatives.

08:51.653 --> 08:54.326
They're just trying to get healthy.

08:54.413 --> 08:58.008
There is a fine line between health and vanity.

08:58.093 --> 08:59.367
Huh?

08:59.453 --> 09:05.085
Well, this obsession with physical perfection
clouds a society's moral vision.

09:05.173 --> 09:07.323
- You are ogling that woman.
- No, I'm not.

09:07.413 --> 09:10.803
- Yes, you are.
- l-I'm just admiring her routine.

09:10.893 --> 09:15.250
Hi. I'm the wellness centre's manager,
Dr Jason. I understand you're with the FBI.

09:15.333 --> 09:19.246
Special Agent Booth. This is Dr Brennan.
We're here about Tommy Sour.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.324
- He in trouble?
- He's dead.

09:23.213 --> 09:26.728
That explains why he's not returning my calls.

09:26.813 --> 09:30.328
- You don't seem too upset.
- Tommy was my most popular trainer.

09:30.413 --> 09:34.486
Since he disappeared,
I've had to deal with a lot of angry clients.

09:34.573 --> 09:36.450
You're FBI. Tommy was murdered?

09:36.533 --> 09:40.492
Look, you wouldn't happen to know a woman,
a client of his? Pam?

09:40.573 --> 09:43.292
Some people referred to her as Fat Pam.

09:43.373 --> 09:45.933
I know who you mean. Pam Nunan.

09:46.013 --> 09:50.404
She booked two-hour sessions.
Paid cash. Perfect client until...

09:50.493 --> 09:52.165
Until?

09:52.253 --> 09:55.325
She fell in love with Tommy.
She started to freak him out.

09:55.413 --> 09:57.847
- How so?
- He said she was too handsy.

09:57.933 --> 10:01.562
She'd rub up against him.
Even invited him on a Caribbean cruise.

10:01.653 --> 10:05.248
- Would you have Miss Nunan's address?
-  Sure.

10:08.613 --> 10:11.650
Booth! That does not help the investigation.

10:14.533 --> 10:18.924
He's such a cutie, isn't he?
Tommy is such a wonderful person.

10:19.013 --> 10:21.402
Big heart and so devoted.

10:21.493 --> 10:23.529
You brought a photo album?

10:23.613 --> 10:27.208
You wanted to talk about Tommy.
I figured you'd like to see pictures.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.443
Those pictures are...

10:31.333 --> 10:35.246
They, uh... They are taken
from quite a distance, Pam.

10:35.333 --> 10:38.245
He's so shy.
It's one of the things I love about him.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.847
We understand Tommy
was your personal trainer?

10:40.933 --> 10:44.812
He was so much more than that. Before
I met Tommy, I was so down on myself.

10:44.893 --> 10:48.090
But Tommy, he's such a sweetheart.

10:48.173 --> 10:51.085
Does Tommy share your affection?

10:51.173 --> 10:55.007
Why do you ask it like that?
Because I don't look like a scarecrow like her?

10:55.093 --> 10:59.484
Hey! Wha? What are you coming after me
for? Do I look like a scarecrow?

10:59.573 --> 11:02.531
Well... you...
I think you look good.

11:02.613 --> 11:07.846
Thank you. Like Tommy, you see me
for who I really am. Not scrawny.

11:07.933 --> 11:12.404
What? I am not scrawny. My body mass index
is well within normal limits.

11:12.493 --> 11:14.609
Can we talk about Tommy, please?

11:14.693 --> 11:16.888
If he didn't love me,
why'd he want to marry me?

11:16.973 --> 11:19.487
Marry you? He was gonna marry you?

11:19.573 --> 11:22.610
Tommy's my life, and I'm his.

11:22.693 --> 11:25.207
Whatever you think he's done,
he didn't do it.

11:25.293 --> 11:30.287
We're not worried about what he did.
It's what you might've done.

11:30.373 --> 11:32.762
Tommy is dead.

11:40.573 --> 11:44.532
She has body image issues
which are not congruent with her appearance.

11:44.613 --> 11:47.889
She's slightly large
but believes she's a very large woman

11:47.973 --> 11:51.124
who can convince people
she's only slightly large.

11:51.213 --> 11:55.206
And the way people treat her
convinces her that she's right.

11:55.293 --> 11:58.842
- That's interesting.
- You're only pretending it's interesting.

11:58.933 --> 12:02.130
- It means very little to you.
- That's true.

12:02.213 --> 12:05.364
You have an irrational prejudice
against psychology

12:05.453 --> 12:08.365
because of emotions
that are too complicated for you.

12:08.453 --> 12:10.603
And I poke and I prod at them,

12:10.693 --> 12:13.730
which makes them real and painful.

12:13.813 --> 12:17.169
And yet I feel no pain.
Just a sort of disinterest.

12:17.253 --> 12:21.041
So why don't you take
your powers of observation,

12:21.133 --> 12:23.931
focus them on her?

12:25.533 --> 12:30.891
- All right. She's sorting her trail mix.
- That mean something?

12:30.973 --> 12:34.488
She's trying to control a situation
that's out of her control.

12:34.573 --> 12:37.485
Or she's just bored.
She's been waiting almost an hour.

12:41.973 --> 12:48.003
- I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
- I didn't kill Tommy. I loved him.

12:48.093 --> 12:52.006
-  What's this?
- I got bored. I've been here over an hour.

12:54.093 --> 12:58.132
- I believe that you loved Tommy.
- Thank you, Agent Booth. I did.

12:58.213 --> 13:01.888
- But I don't believe he loved you back.
- Because I'm not anorexic?

13:01.973 --> 13:03.725
- Miss Nunan...
- Call me Pam.

13:03.813 --> 13:08.091
Pam, you were stalking him,
and he was avoiding you.

13:08.173 --> 13:11.609
If he didn't love me,
why would he give me this for Christmas?

13:11.693 --> 13:15.402
P-a-m. Do you know what that spells?

13:15.493 --> 13:17.643
- Pam.
- That's right.

13:17.733 --> 13:21.521
What did, um... you give him
before he gave you that bracelet?

13:21.613 --> 13:23.843
Ah. Excellent question.

13:23.933 --> 13:26.970
- <i>Why does that matter?</i>
- I'm just curious.

13:27.053 --> 13:30.568
A $1,000 gift certificate to the music centre.
He loved music.

13:30.653 --> 13:33.292
$1,000? Wow. That's generous.

13:33.373 --> 13:36.570
A way to obligate him,
try and force an emotional connection.

13:36.653 --> 13:40.487
- It's extremely passive-aggressive.
- So do you think she killed him?

13:40.573 --> 13:43.292
Well, there's no question
that she's deluded.

13:43.373 --> 13:46.410
I mean, if she truly believed
that he was gonna marry her,

13:46.493 --> 13:49.405
then she was setting herself up
for a tragic ending.

13:49.493 --> 13:52.803
- Tragic?
- One way to ensure that he didn't leave her...

13:52.893 --> 13:56.568
- Would be to kill him.
<i>-  Tommy had a beautiful voice.</i>

13:56.653 --> 14:00.646
<i>He dreamed of being a professional singer</i>
<i>and I wanted to support him.</i>

14:00.733 --> 14:03.088
<i>I did everything for him.</i>

14:03.173 --> 14:07.530
He was mine. Tommy was mine,
no matter what anyone thought.

14:07.973 --> 14:11.966
- When did you find him?
- Last night. He had been dead for two weeks.

14:12.053 --> 14:16.444
I've been in Florida. Left last month,
just got back two days ago.

14:16.533 --> 14:19.445
I was with Mom and Daddy
planning the wedding.

14:21.173 --> 14:23.733
The wedding with Tommy?

14:23.813 --> 14:26.202
Of course, silly.

14:27.373 --> 14:32.242
I'm just gonna need you to write down
your parents' number in Florida

14:32.333 --> 14:35.450
so I can confirm your whereabouts.

14:37.653 --> 14:39.644
Thanks.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.524
Who's gonna love me now?

14:45.093 --> 14:46.890
I'm sorry.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.884
- No, no, no. Don't touch her.
- Why?

14:50.173 --> 14:53.210
Thank you, Agent Booth.

14:55.053 --> 14:58.887
The pathology is clear.
She is possessive and amoral.

14:58.973 --> 15:02.249
Her connections are forged
through manipulation and delusion.

15:02.333 --> 15:05.564
- Once a connection that tenuous breaks...
- She killed Sour?

15:05.653 --> 15:09.407
I can't say that, of course.
But she is a dangerous person.

15:09.493 --> 15:15.011
Thank you. Well, her story checks out.
She was in Florida when he was killed.

15:15.093 --> 15:20.406
Her parents are devastated that their future
son-in-law will no longer be her love monkey.

15:20.493 --> 15:25.521
- Dr Sweets still thinks that she's a killer.
- Dangerous. I think she's dangerous.

15:25.613 --> 15:28.446
- I agree.
- Thank you, Agent Booth.

15:28.533 --> 15:31.252
All those gifts
and taking pictures from a distance

15:31.333 --> 15:36.361
and showing up in the middle of the night
in a nightie, it's all very dangerous.

15:36.453 --> 15:38.887
Mocking will not change my opinion.

15:38.973 --> 15:42.124
I've been mocked many, many times before.

15:44.813 --> 15:47.452
- That came out wrong.
- That's great, Sweets.

15:47.533 --> 15:50.286
Appreciate your help.
But she has an alibi. See ya.

15:50.373 --> 15:54.048
Well, just be cautious of her, OK?
She's not stable.

15:54.133 --> 15:56.363
- Great. Thank you.
- Oh...

15:56.453 --> 16:02.483
And remember, our session on Tuesday
is at four. Trust exercises. Be there.

16:02.573 --> 16:04.404
Uh-huh. See ya.

16:07.053 --> 16:10.443
- I got your page.
- The vic's tox report just came back.

16:10.533 --> 16:13.286
There were trace amounts of THC
in his bloodstream.

16:13.373 --> 16:16.524
That's why you paged me?
Because he smoked marijuana?

16:16.613 --> 16:18.444
No. Check out the monitor.

16:18.533 --> 16:21.923
- His blood was infected with a bacterium.
- E coli.

16:22.013 --> 16:26.211
Given the concentration, the infection
occurred within hours of his death.

16:26.293 --> 16:29.763
- Well, what was the source?
- I'm getting there.

16:29.853 --> 16:32.492
The CDC tracks all E coli outbreaks

16:32.573 --> 16:35.531
and the last E coli ground zero
was in Virginia

16:35.613 --> 16:37.968
at the Checkerbox in Alexandria.

16:38.053 --> 16:43.650
The culprit? Tainted raw honey, the same
kind I found in Tommy Sour's stomach.

16:45.693 --> 16:48.605
# So many men seem destined

16:48.693 --> 16:51.412
# To settle for something small

16:52.093 --> 16:55.085
# But I won't rest until I know

16:55.173 --> 16:57.323
# I'll have it all

16:58.453 --> 17:01.525
Finally. One more show tune
and I was gonna start shooting.

17:01.613 --> 17:05.049
He has excellent projection.
I heard him while I was parking.

17:05.133 --> 17:09.569
I talked to some of the patrons here. Open
mic night is every Monday and Tuesday.

17:09.653 --> 17:11.564
Shh.

17:11.653 --> 17:15.531
- Some people think this stuff is good.
- What's open mic night?

17:15.613 --> 17:19.970
It's cabaret meets karaoke. You know,
singers who want to get discovered.

17:20.053 --> 17:22.487
Will you please be quiet?

17:22.573 --> 17:27.488
Based on the E coli in Tommy's blood,
he was here shortly before he was killed.

17:27.573 --> 17:31.327
- Pammy said he was musical.
- # Gotta find my corner

17:31.413 --> 17:33.643
This guy is not bad.

17:34.293 --> 17:37.251
- You're kidding.
- No. He's... I love his enthusiasm.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.847
Dude! Do I need to get the manager?

17:39.933 --> 17:45.291
Dude. Actually, you know what? That would
be great. Why don't you point him out to us?

17:47.453 --> 17:50.525
Yeah! All right!

17:52.133 --> 17:56.604
Up next, the smooth and smoky
Chris Calabasa.

18:00.133 --> 18:04.365
Excuse me.
Agent Booth, FBI.

18:04.453 --> 18:07.172
Oh, come on.
I told you guys everything I know.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.767
I bought the honey
from a company in Maryland.

18:09.853 --> 18:13.482
I gave the CDC guy the bill of sale
and the honey. What else you want?

18:13.573 --> 18:16.849
We're not here about that.
We need to speak about Tommy Sour.

18:16.933 --> 18:19.811
- We believe he was murdered.
- Murdered?

18:19.893 --> 18:24.489
- Were you friends?
- Well, he was good for business, talented.

18:24.573 --> 18:27.371
Showed up at every open mic night
since day one.

18:27.453 --> 18:30.763
When I didn't see him around,
I figured he got a paying gig.

18:30.853 --> 18:35.005
- Was his final performance unusual?
- No. Everybody loved him like always.

18:35.093 --> 18:37.402
Everybody thinks
they're the next Kelly Clarkson.

18:37.493 --> 18:39.688
- You got that right.
- Who?

18:39.773 --> 18:43.561
- <i>American Idol?.</i> "Because of You"?
- Because of me?

18:44.053 --> 18:46.692
Never mind, OK?
Just stay here. Not up there.

18:46.773 --> 18:51.369
- So, did he have any enemies?
- Yeah. You're listening to him right now.

18:51.453 --> 18:54.889
There was a talent scout here that night.
Tommy stole his song.

18:54.973 --> 18:57.726
- Chris had to default to "Piano Man".
- That hurts.

18:57.813 --> 19:01.806
When Chris finished singing,
he and Tommy started shoving each other.

19:01.893 --> 19:05.010
I told them to go outside.
They disappeared into the parking lot.

19:05.093 --> 19:08.483
- Well, then what?
- I don't know. I never saw Tommy again.

19:08.573 --> 19:13.488
# Oh, love is lovelier
the second time around

19:13.573 --> 19:18.044
Tommy was a jerk. He'd fill the joint with his
groupies who'd hoot when he sang off key

19:18.133 --> 19:21.489
and talk through the other acts.
Know what that does to a singer?

19:21.573 --> 19:25.452
I would imagine it would be disheartening
given your need for acclaim.

19:25.533 --> 19:28.127
- Bones...
- What? It's a primal human need.

19:28.213 --> 19:30.363
The foundation for royalty and...

19:30.453 --> 19:33.843
- You'll just confuse him. Go on.
- Tommy thought he'd make it big.

19:33.933 --> 19:37.084
He wrote a $1 million cheque,
said he'd cash it by Christmas.

19:37.173 --> 19:41.007
- Well, was he any good?
- He had some dude videotape his set.

19:41.093 --> 19:43.607
It's on his MySpace page.
Check it for yourself.

19:43.693 --> 19:45.524
This guy is good.

19:47.813 --> 19:51.169
Thank you, Paula.
Can we just focus here?

19:51.253 --> 19:55.166
The night Tommy was killed, the two of you
got into an argument over a song?

19:55.253 --> 19:58.370
Not just <i>a song, my</i> song.
"Far Away" by Nickelback.

19:58.453 --> 20:01.763
- He knew I was saving that for scout night.
- That make you angry?

20:01.853 --> 20:04.845
I didn't kill the guy.
I vented and Tommy took off.

20:04.933 --> 20:07.242
You just said, "Goodbye. See you later"?

20:07.333 --> 20:10.609
I came back inside.
I wanted to introduce myself to the scout.

20:10.693 --> 20:14.129
- He's back again. You can ask him yourself.
- You know what? I think I will. Stay here.

20:19.173 --> 20:24.531
-  Is this guy a star, or what?
- You his agent?

20:24.613 --> 20:28.845
No, I'm just a fan. A fan of the music.
So, what label are you with?

20:28.933 --> 20:30.730
- I'm an independent.
- Oh.

20:30.813 --> 20:34.362
Me and my roommate had a band in college.
We weren't half bad.

20:34.453 --> 20:38.287
All the A&R guys, they'd sit in the front.
What are you doing in the back?

20:38.373 --> 20:40.887
- What's it to you?
- Hey, what are you drinking?

20:41.333 --> 20:43.403
Excuse me! Hey!

20:43.853 --> 20:46.003
Ooh. What the hell is this? Doodles?

20:46.093 --> 20:48.926
- Everything OK here?
- What do you say we step outside?

20:49.013 --> 20:52.323
- Why are you impersonating a talent scout?
- I don't know what...

20:52.413 --> 20:55.485
Answer the question
or I'll arrest you right now for fraud.

20:55.573 --> 20:58.485
- But <i>I didn't...
- Wait. You two are working together.</i>

20:58.573 --> 21:01.292
You knew if there was a talent scout
in the audience,

21:01.373 --> 21:05.002
more singers would show up.
You sell more booze, make more money.

21:05.093 --> 21:08.881
I just started the rumour.
I asked Mitch to wear a suit, take some notes.

21:08.973 --> 21:10.929
It was just a job.

21:11.013 --> 21:13.811
Give Tommy the idea
he was gonna get his own contract.

21:13.893 --> 21:15.531
I didn't hurt anybody.

21:15.613 --> 21:18.650
You exploited their need for attention.
That's cruel!

21:18.733 --> 21:22.692
- I am not going down for your crap.
- I get it. Tommy figures it all out.

21:22.773 --> 21:25.287
There's an argument.
He confronts you.

21:25.373 --> 21:29.730
No, no. I swear it. Tommy knew
nothing about Mitch. No one did.

21:30.253 --> 21:35.122
You pull this scam again and I'll arrest you
for conspiracy, fraud and misrepresentation.

21:35.213 --> 21:37.249
- You got me?
- Yes.

21:37.333 --> 21:38.891
Sir.

21:40.693 --> 21:43.651
Come on. And don't even
think about leaving town,

21:43.733 --> 21:47.169
cos both of you are
under investigation for murder.

21:47.253 --> 21:50.245
- They are?
- No. I just don't like them.

22:10.533 --> 22:12.364
- How's it coming?
- Still looking.

22:12.453 --> 22:15.365
The shaving was wafer thin
and conformed to the...

22:15.453 --> 22:17.921
- I need the bones, man.
- As do I, Hodgins.

22:18.013 --> 22:20.573
I need to swab the ligature furrows.

22:20.653 --> 22:23.326
- Did you know that I sang, too?
- What?

22:23.413 --> 22:25.449
- As a child.
- You?

22:25.533 --> 22:28.445
My parents felt singing
would integrate me socially.

22:28.533 --> 22:30.808
- Really?
- Yes. I was quite good.

22:30.893 --> 22:34.329
I received acclaim and stature
amongst the parents of my peers.

22:34.413 --> 22:38.372
- What about your actual peers?
- My mother said they were jealous.

22:38.453 --> 22:41.092
Jealous of your singing?

22:41.173 --> 22:44.563
Yeah. I'm trying, Zack,
but I just... I can't see it.

22:44.653 --> 22:50.171
# Love is a many splendored thing

22:50.253 --> 22:56.283
# It's the April rose that only grows
in the early spring

22:56.373 --> 23:00.730
# When your fingers
touched my silent heart

23:00.813 --> 23:03.486
# And taught it how to sing

23:03.573 --> 23:06.804
# Yes, true love's

23:06.893 --> 23:14.083
# A many splendored thing

23:18.573 --> 23:19.562
Wow!

23:19.653 --> 23:23.168
That was great. That was great.

23:23.253 --> 23:25.642
Thank you.
I should get back to work now.

23:25.733 --> 23:27.963
Listen, Pavarotti.

23:28.053 --> 23:31.807
I need the C5 vertebra,
the hyoid and the temporal bone.

23:31.893 --> 23:35.966
- We need a weapon.
- By ID'ing the particulates in the wounds,

23:36.053 --> 23:38.408
I can give you more to go on.

23:38.493 --> 23:40.688
Thanks for the concert.

23:41.773 --> 23:44.526
- Is there something you need?
- No.

23:44.613 --> 23:46.604
Uh... no. I'm just doing my...

23:46.693 --> 23:49.161
Just... Thanks.

23:56.413 --> 24:00.452
I get it when a kid wants to be a rock star
but half of those singers were over 30.

24:00.533 --> 24:02.763
Do they really think they'll be famous?

24:02.853 --> 24:05.321
The need to stand out from the crowd
is innate.

24:05.413 --> 24:08.325
- It's obnoxious.
- You were the best sniper in the army.

24:08.413 --> 24:12.247
- I was just doing my job. Well.
- And that set you apart from the others.

24:12.333 --> 24:15.769
We're talking about singing
some nightmarish Broadway songs.

24:15.853 --> 24:21.246
It doesn't matter. Whoever is best has status
and power and becomes a superior being.

24:21.333 --> 24:24.803
Some of those people are not
gonna be mating. That's for sure.

24:24.893 --> 24:29.603
But they will have power and prestige.
You enjoy it because you are a superb agent.

24:29.693 --> 24:31.285
- You think?
- Of course.

24:31.373 --> 24:35.844
I'm best in my field. It'd be self-destructive
to work with someone who's beneath me.

24:35.933 --> 24:40.882
Oh, OK. Well, that's good, because, um...
you know, I have to be honest here.

24:40.973 --> 24:44.170
Sometimes I think that you feel
that you're better than me.

24:44.253 --> 24:46.972
- Well, I'm more intelligent...
- There you go.

24:47.053 --> 24:52.286
...in certain areas, and in others,
I understand my limitations

24:52.373 --> 24:55.524
and I... admire your expertise.

24:56.093 --> 24:57.412
Huh.

24:57.493 --> 25:00.929
- You admire me?
- In certain areas of expertise.

25:01.013 --> 25:04.801
Well, I admire your expertise.
You know, the whole science thing.

25:04.893 --> 25:07.407
- Thank you. I'm an author, too.
- I know.

25:07.493 --> 25:10.565
- That also gives me elevated status.
- Here comes the ego.

25:10.653 --> 25:14.089
No, I'm not saying that society's correct
to elevate me.

25:14.173 --> 25:17.927
I'm not saying I deserve the elevation.
I'm just saying that it occurs.

25:18.013 --> 25:21.608
Society should elevate scholars, not actors.

25:21.693 --> 25:24.651
- Yeah. What about cops?
- Very important.

25:24.733 --> 25:29.204
- Yeah? This is Agent Booth.
- It's Pam. Pam Nunan.

25:29.293 --> 25:32.410
- How can I help you, Miss Nunan?
- Are you available to meet?

25:32.493 --> 25:36.042
I'm sorry, how did you get my number?

25:36.133 --> 25:40.172
Your office patched me through.
I said I was your mother.

25:40.253 --> 25:45.008
- Yeah. Dr Brennan and I can meet with you.
- No. Just you.

25:45.653 --> 25:50.363
If it's relevant to the case, Miss Nunan, I think
it would be important that Dr Brennan...

25:50.453 --> 25:53.331
I can be there in a half-hour.
You have to meet me alone.

25:53.413 --> 25:55.927
<i>I'm sorry. Is this about Tommy?</i>

25:57.453 --> 25:59.921
What else would it be about, Agent Booth?

26:00.813 --> 26:03.008
OK. Half an hour.

26:05.093 --> 26:07.323
What did she want?

26:07.413 --> 26:09.847
She wants to see me without you.

26:09.933 --> 26:12.891
- Did she say why?
- Probably you make her uncomfortable.

26:12.973 --> 26:15.612
- How so?
- Well, because you're you.

26:15.693 --> 26:18.253
And you're a well-adjusted woman.

26:18.333 --> 26:24.522
And a bestselling author. I was on the <i>New</i>
<i>York Times</i> list for 18 weeks and I won the...

26:32.293 --> 26:35.126
- Right this way.
- I really appreciate you seeing me.

26:35.213 --> 26:39.650
- Uh, it's my job.
- That's precious. It's your job.

26:39.733 --> 26:42.486
- You said you had information about...
- Hockey fan.

26:42.573 --> 26:46.327
I have that same print in my office.
And it's Pam.

26:46.413 --> 26:49.689
I have season tickets to the Capitals.
We should go sometime.

26:49.773 --> 26:53.607
- Miss Nunan, about the case?
- Seeley, please. Pam.

26:53.693 --> 26:56.765
- I need to ask you something.
- Usually I ask the questions.

26:56.853 --> 26:59.003
Are you dating Dr Brennan?

26:59.813 --> 27:03.772
- No. She's my partner.
- I see.

27:03.853 --> 27:06.367
Your nephew?

27:06.453 --> 27:08.489
- It's my son.
- You're married?

27:08.573 --> 27:12.361
I'm not. Listen, I'm kind of busy here,
Miss Nunan.

27:12.453 --> 27:14.808
I brought you something.

27:22.413 --> 27:25.325
- OK...
- I know you've got a thing for socks.

27:25.413 --> 27:27.563
- How did you?
- I noticed last time.

27:27.653 --> 27:31.248
On the outside you're this tough guy,
but really you're just like me.

27:31.333 --> 27:33.847
- Unpredictable, like Tommy was.
- Please.

27:33.933 --> 27:38.529
I know. We shouldn't talk about old flames
when we're just getting to know each other.

27:38.613 --> 27:41.411
You said you had information
about Tommy's murder.

27:41.493 --> 27:44.963
Really? I have faith
you'll find out who killed him.

27:45.053 --> 27:47.886
And Tommy wouldn't want me
to grieve forever.

27:47.973 --> 27:50.362
Look at all these commendations.

27:50.453 --> 27:53.650
You're really great at your job, aren't you?

27:55.973 --> 27:59.761
- It's one reason I'm drawn to you.
- Ma'am, this is way inappropriate.

27:59.853 --> 28:02.651
"Ma'am."  That is so cute.

28:02.733 --> 28:05.725
I can't wait to tell my mom
you just said that.

28:05.813 --> 28:08.566
Well, bye for now.

28:22.213 --> 28:26.570
# <i>Sunrise, there's a new sun rising</i>

28:26.653 --> 28:31.488
- What are you watching?
- Dr Sweets found Sour's MySpace video.

28:32.053 --> 28:34.965
He's got an OK voice,
but he's trying a bit hard.

28:35.053 --> 28:39.490
There are two types of performers.
Presentational singers crave attention.

28:39.573 --> 28:44.647
Representational singers want the audience
to feel. It's about a cathartic experience.

28:44.733 --> 28:48.806
- He's showing off.
- Easy on the eyes, easy to forget.

28:48.893 --> 28:53.125
- One-hit wonder at best, like Chumbawamba.
- Chumba-what-a?

28:53.213 --> 28:56.888
"Tubthumping"?
Oh, come on. Are you serious?

28:56.973 --> 28:59.168
It's a great song. It's anthemic.

28:59.253 --> 29:03.166
- This is all simple psychology to you?
- Actions are motivated by need.

29:03.253 --> 29:06.484
When we discover our needs,
we discover who we are. So, yes.

29:06.573 --> 29:09.292
No. Society makes us who we are.
Not psychology.

29:09.373 --> 29:14.606
Society shapes our actions. Culture
compels us, not some toilet-training mishap.

29:14.693 --> 29:18.606
I'm gonna break you two up. You keep
this fighting up, no one gets dessert.

29:18.693 --> 29:22.447
We're not fighting.
It's just a collegial debate, right?

29:22.533 --> 29:24.205
Right.

29:24.293 --> 29:27.842
- How'd it go with Pam?
- Wait. You saw her again?

29:27.933 --> 29:31.369
What's the big deal, Sweets?
She just gave me a pair of socks.

29:31.453 --> 29:34.968
What? It's not funny.

29:35.053 --> 29:36.611
- It's not.
- Why did I laugh?

29:36.693 --> 29:41.926
Pam controls your emotional agenda through
seeming vulnerability followed by generosity.

29:42.013 --> 29:45.085
- It's classic manipulation.
- I'll mail the socks back.

29:45.173 --> 29:47.892
Look. Tommy was about to release a CD.

29:47.973 --> 29:52.285
-  "I Can't Do Better Than You."
- I wonder if Pam thought that was for her?

29:52.373 --> 29:56.002
Yeah. She probably saw
secret messages in all of his songs.

29:56.093 --> 29:58.891
Until I was 13,
I wanted to be the next Cyndi Lauper.

29:58.973 --> 30:01.851
I'd say you were kidding
but I don't think you know how.

30:01.933 --> 30:07.644
The other girls and I referred to her as "rad".
My mother said that I sang just as well.

30:07.733 --> 30:09.644
- As well as Cyndi Lauper?
- Yes.

30:09.733 --> 30:13.282
- Mothers do that. It's healthy.
- No. This wasnâ€™t just flattery.

30:13.373 --> 30:17.332
My mother told me I sang "Girls Just
Want To Have Fun" better than she did.

30:17.413 --> 30:21.929
It was an expression of affection,
not an objective evaluation of your abilities.

30:22.013 --> 30:25.323
- Well, I think you're wrong.
- OK then, go ahead. Belt it out.

30:25.413 --> 30:27.563
- No. Absolutely not.
- Give us a few bars.

30:27.653 --> 30:30.042
- Come on!
- I canâ€™t just bust into song.

30:30.133 --> 30:35.048
I have to have music
and an appropriate atmosphere of frivolity.

30:35.133 --> 30:39.570
Diva, forensic genius,
bestselling author, better than Cyndi Lauper...

30:39.653 --> 30:43.851
Wait, look. Freeze the video.
Look at him.

30:43.933 --> 30:47.050
Tommy's singing to the woman next to him,
who shushed us.

30:47.133 --> 30:51.046
His corrugator muscles are furrowed.
His lips are tight, teeth clenched.

30:51.133 --> 30:55.649
His mentalis is crinkled.
The corrugator muscles are the...

30:55.733 --> 30:58.850
- We know.
- I don't know. I don't know that.

30:58.933 --> 31:03.449
He appears to be very angry.
Like, "get out of my way" angry.

31:03.533 --> 31:06.331
- He plays the guitar.
- Yeah?

31:07.493 --> 31:08.892
That's how Tommy died.

31:12.053 --> 31:15.762
- The string could be the murder weapon.
- Because it cut the cheese?

31:15.853 --> 31:20.404
Because the exemplar wound approximates
the tool marks on the victim's C5.

31:20.493 --> 31:23.724
Yeah, he knew that.
He just wanted to say "cut the cheese".

31:25.053 --> 31:28.807
OK. Hodgins, you are the guitar player.

31:28.893 --> 31:33.045
- Zack, you are Tommy.
- Re-enactment. Fascinating.

31:33.133 --> 31:37.888
- Not for me. I'm always the one that's killed.
- You're the singer. The singer was the vic.

31:37.973 --> 31:41.283
Tommy was strangled from behind
with a wire or guitar string.

31:41.373 --> 31:43.170
The string was pulled tight...

31:43.253 --> 31:45.972
- Slicing his throat and trachea.
- Of course.

31:46.053 --> 31:49.602
- As he lost consciousness, he fell.
-  Fracturing his chin.

31:49.693 --> 31:54.005
Wait a second. He was a big guy.
According to your scenario, he was passive.

31:54.093 --> 31:56.561
Nothing in the data
suggests he fought back.

31:56.653 --> 32:01.443
Wait a sec. Tommy was... He was high.
He was toasted. It could've dulled his reflexes.

32:01.533 --> 32:08.450
This explains the shaving of the vertebra. A
guitar string would slice a thin sliver of bone

32:08.533 --> 32:10.842
as Tommy dropped to the ground.

32:10.933 --> 32:12.286
Amazing.

32:12.613 --> 32:16.686
Tommy Sour was strangled, Dax.
Possibly with a guitar string.

32:16.773 --> 32:20.846
Now, I know that you didn't like him
singing to your girl.

32:21.293 --> 32:25.889
What the hell are you talking about?
My girl's in Texas.

32:27.493 --> 32:31.042
- And that?
- That's Helen. We perform together.

32:31.133 --> 32:34.728
You know she's married, right?
To someone else?

32:34.813 --> 32:37.771
- Why do you look so angry?
- Tommy was a son of a bitch.

32:37.853 --> 32:40.572
I'm feeling paranoid,
like I'm being persecuted.

32:40.653 --> 32:45.090
Persecuted? Really?
Maybe because you're feeling a little guilty?

32:45.173 --> 32:49.724
I introduced Tommy to my trainer Jason.
Jason runs a wellness centre.

32:49.813 --> 32:53.806
- He needed trainers and Tommy was one.
- Jason? As in Jason Bergman?

32:53.893 --> 32:56.123
- Yeah. You know him?
- Yeah, we've met.

32:56.213 --> 32:59.683
Tommy and Jason wanted to open up
a place together. One they owned.

32:59.773 --> 33:05.405
So they went out and they got a loan. Tommy
stole the money. It was 50 grand, man.

33:05.493 --> 33:08.326
Tommy used the money
to produce his own CD.

33:08.413 --> 33:12.326
High-end musicians,
arrangements, publicity, the works.

33:12.413 --> 33:14.973
That's why I'm harbouring
the negative vibes.

33:15.053 --> 33:17.567
Yeah. I can only imagine how Jason feels.

33:17.653 --> 33:20.963
I contacted the bank.
Jason is on the hook for the full amount.

33:21.053 --> 33:23.931
Which he conveniently forgot
when we spoke to him.

33:24.013 --> 33:26.925
- All right, Bones.
- Dr Jason didn't come in today.

33:27.013 --> 33:29.481
- His cell isn't on.
- Is that unusual?

33:29.573 --> 33:32.485
You could call him day or night.
He'd always answer.

33:32.573 --> 33:34.882
Great, thanks.
Yeah, hi. It's Agent Booth.

33:34.973 --> 33:39.888
I need a BOLO for a Dr Jason Bergman,
wanted for first-degree murder.

33:42.773 --> 33:46.527
- Oh, Dr Hodgins.
- Hey, Dr B. What's up?

33:46.613 --> 33:49.332
Did you swab the C5 vertebra
for elemental trace?

33:49.413 --> 33:53.770
The C5 vertebra, the hyoid and the temporal
bone. Analysing the particulates now.

33:53.853 --> 33:58.244
- I'll need your results as soon as possible.
- I'm on it. How'd it go with guitar guy?

33:58.333 --> 34:01.689
- Booth doesn't think it's him. No motive.
- But the wound?

34:01.773 --> 34:07.723
It's a wire of some kind, but not from him.
Booth suspects the wellness centre manager.

34:07.813 --> 34:11.692
So you're looking for some wire
used in a gym or by a physical therapist.

34:11.773 --> 34:17.245
Yes. Assuming that it was a crime of passion,
the killer would've used something handy.

34:17.333 --> 34:19.722
Brennan.

34:21.733 --> 34:24.964
OK. I'll meet you there.
I need those results.

34:25.053 --> 34:26.964
Right away.

34:27.053 --> 34:30.284
I quit my job, decided to move out of town.
So what?

34:30.373 --> 34:33.206
Officer pulled you over
on the Interstate in Ohio.

34:33.293 --> 34:36.603
You've been travelling nonstop
since yesterday morning.

34:36.693 --> 34:38.684
- Is that a crime?
- Maybe.

34:40.013 --> 34:42.049
We know about the business loan.

34:42.132 --> 34:46.172
Then you also know I'm the last person
in the world that would want Tommy dead.

34:46.253 --> 34:49.643
- I'm responsible for the whole nut.
- The nut?

34:49.733 --> 34:51.451
50 grand!

34:53.453 --> 34:56.684
- I couldn't see another way out.
- You thought you could hide?

34:56.773 --> 35:00.049
I'm not married. I got no close family.

35:00.133 --> 35:03.648
Yeah, I thought I could disappear.
You hear about it all the time.

35:03.733 --> 35:08.363
I think you were pissed and you just snapped.
Huh? That place was everything to you.

35:08.453 --> 35:11.684
Tommy ruined it for you,
so you ruined him.

35:11.773 --> 35:13.968
You know what I think, Agent Booth?

35:14.053 --> 35:17.363
Motive without evidence
is like riding a stationary bike.

35:17.453 --> 35:20.251
- You get nowhere fast.
- Like right now?

35:20.333 --> 35:24.406
Dr Bergman, did you use any wires
or wirelike instruments at the gym

35:24.493 --> 35:27.053
or in your chiropractic practice?

35:29.573 --> 35:33.009
- Questions will have to go through a lawyer.
- Yep. Well...

35:33.093 --> 35:34.526
- Oh!
- Hodgins!

35:34.613 --> 35:37.047
- Sorry to barge in.
- You can't barge in here.

35:37.133 --> 35:40.443
There was elemental evidence
on the vertebra.

35:40.533 --> 35:44.128
- What is it?
- Phyllosilicate minerals, aluminium oxides.

35:44.213 --> 35:45.362
- Oh.
- Yeah.

35:45.453 --> 35:47.648
- What? English?
- It's clay.

35:47.733 --> 35:50.201
- Very good.
- I have nothing to do with clay.

35:50.293 --> 35:53.285
- You're totally gonna be cleared.
- You can't say that.

35:53.373 --> 35:56.365
Silver particulates were embedded
in the composite.

35:56.453 --> 35:58.091
- On his vertebra?
- Yeah.

35:58.173 --> 36:01.768
There is a company which infuses
sculpting clay with silver powder.

36:01.853 --> 36:05.004
They sell direct via the internet.
And get this.

36:05.093 --> 36:11.089
They recently shipped a package of the clay
to the other unit of our victim's duplex.

36:19.533 --> 36:23.048
- A warrant to search my place?
- Wow, he can read.

36:23.133 --> 36:26.125
I reported Tommy missing.
Why would I be hiding anything?

36:26.213 --> 36:29.683
You killed Tommy.
You reported him missing to cover your ass.

36:29.773 --> 36:32.526
No, no. Hey, excuse me?
What are you doing?

36:32.613 --> 36:36.083
Oh. Are you asking
because you have an interest in forensics?

36:36.173 --> 36:37.401
What?

36:37.493 --> 36:42.567
This clay-cutting wire is consistent
with the object used to kill Tommy Sour.

36:42.653 --> 36:47.044
- I'm testing it for blood.
- Just look at it. There's no blood on it.

36:50.973 --> 36:57.003
If the liquid turns blue, it means this wire
came in contact with human blood.

37:00.733 --> 37:03.293
You are under arrest
for the murder of Tommy Sour.

37:03.373 --> 37:06.763
Wait. You don't understand.
I didn't want to. The noise was...

37:06.853 --> 37:10.129
- The noise?
- Yeah, you hear it. The alarm clock.

37:10.213 --> 37:14.491
These walls are so thin. And I needed to work,
to concentrate for my show.

37:14.573 --> 37:18.361
Tommy'd just sing at the top of his lungs
day and night. He never shut up.

37:18.453 --> 37:22.731
I begged him to lower his voice,
to sing quietly. But he didn't care.

37:22.813 --> 37:25.281
And that gives you the right
to strangle him?

37:25.373 --> 37:30.242
No. I was just trying to scare him. He was
taking his trash to the alley and singing.

37:30.333 --> 37:33.723
He's bigger than me.
I never thought I could kill him.

37:33.813 --> 37:38.523
- He was stoned. He couldn't fight back.
- I just... I pulled on the wire,

37:38.613 --> 37:41.730
and he fell down and...
and he was dead.

37:44.053 --> 37:47.329
But it was quiet. It was finally quiet.

37:56.933 --> 38:00.005
- Start in a low key then go to a higher key.
- That was great.

38:00.093 --> 38:03.688
What's going on?
Why did you call me here, Booth?

38:03.773 --> 38:08.005
Your need to sing in front of a live audience -
it's innate, Bones.

38:08.093 --> 38:12.006
- No way.
- Hey, I got the music, the frivolity.

38:12.093 --> 38:14.971
- What else do you need?
- Come on. You can do it.

38:15.053 --> 38:17.726
We're here for you! We're here for you!

38:18.333 --> 38:22.372
You are very controlled. I think it'd be
a good idea for you to let yourself go.

38:22.453 --> 38:24.125
Really? What about you?

38:24.213 --> 38:26.727
I will be singing "Lime in de Coconut"
after you.

38:26.813 --> 38:30.647
You will be extremely impressed,
as was my abnormal-psychology class.

38:30.733 --> 38:34.169
This opportunity is a gift from Agent Booth.

38:34.253 --> 38:37.643
Trust yourself. Trust your friends.
Let it rip. Let's hear it.

38:40.493 --> 38:42.961
Come on!

38:51.853 --> 38:54.572
# I come home in the morning light

38:54.653 --> 38:59.010
# My mother says,
"When you gonna live your life right?"

38:59.493 --> 39:02.644
# Oh, Mamma dear,
we're not the fortunate ones

39:02.733 --> 39:06.203
# And girls, they wanna have fun

39:06.293 --> 39:10.047
# Oh, girls just wanna have fun

39:17.413 --> 39:19.847
# The phone rings in the middle of the night

39:19.933 --> 39:24.688
# My father yells,
"What you gonna do with your life?"

39:24.773 --> 39:28.561
# Oh, Daddy dear,
you know you're still number one

39:28.653 --> 39:30.371
# But girls, they wanna have fun

39:30.453 --> 39:32.648
Look at me, not her.

39:32.733 --> 39:34.644
# Oh, girls just wanna have...

39:34.733 --> 39:37.850
# That's all they really want

39:37.933 --> 39:40.003
