Uh, it's

16:16.076 --> 16:17.810
with a wide range
of drastic side effects,

16:17.844 --> 16:21.348

at down-regulating

in a woman's body.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.753
There is no evidence

16:29.622 --> 16:31.091

whoever did this to her

her maturity.

what a bright

and how well you've responded

Excuse me, I'm sorry to
interrupt, but I gotta say

18:48.528 --> 18:50.430
locking her up again
doesn't really sound like

18:50.463 --> 18:51.464

19:00.707 --> 19:02.309

Did someone try and hurt you
or touch you in any way?

46:10.468 --> 46:12.603
[light growling]

46:12.637 --> 46:14.639
[knock on door]

46:27.118 --> 46:29.354
- Roger.
- You need any help with her?

46:29.387 --> 46:30.721
No, I'm fine,
thank you.

46:30.755 --> 46:32.257
Well, here's the thing.

46:32.290 --> 46:33.658
Richard Fuller just called

46:33.691 --> 46:35.961
and his 18-year-old son
Lawrence

46:35.994 --> 46:39.464
was also at that party and
he didn't come home either.

46:42.567 --> 46:44.369
He was last seen
around 11:00 p.m.

46:44.402 --> 46:47.772
Tom and I asked the kids, but no
one seems to see him leave, so..

46:47.805 --> 46:49.450
Well, I, I thought maybe
we should ask her.

46:49.474 --> 46:51.742
I think you should let me
handle that.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.796
Anna, you need
to talk to me.

47:14.265 --> 47:16.301
Anna,
you need to tell me

47:16.334 --> 47:19.404
what happened
at that party last night.

47:19.437 --> 47:22.173
You don't wanna be painting
your nails right now.

47:22.207 --> 47:23.474
I'm trying to help you.

47:23.508 --> 47:25.643
- I can't help you if you won't talk to me.
- Ellen.

47:27.212 --> 47:29.847
What's going on?
Are you okay?

47:29.881 --> 47:32.483
Ray, what do you know
about Lawrence Fuller?

47:32.517 --> 47:34.552
You mean besides
being an asshole?

47:34.585 --> 47:36.654
Well, that asshole
is missing.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.856
You think that Anna has
something to do with this?

47:38.890 --> 47:40.134
I... is that what's
going on here?

47:40.158 --> 47:41.802
I want her to tell me
where she was last night.

47:41.826 --> 47:43.494
- She won't talk.
- Ellen.

47:43.528 --> 47:45.072
- I need for you to tell me where you were last night.
- I think it would be better

47:45.096 --> 47:47.532
if I talk to her.
- Oh, you do? Yeah?

47:47.565 --> 47:49.700
- Yes, alone. Yeah.

47:49.734 --> 47:50.868
Thank you.

47:57.275 --> 48:00.611
Don't worry, I won't tell
her about the blood.

48:02.780 --> 48:06.551
Anna, you can't do
stuff like this.

48:06.584 --> 48:08.619
How am I supposed
to protect you?

48:13.959 --> 48:15.460
Let me see.

48:28.639 --> 48:31.809
Ellen!

48:31.842 --> 48:32.810
[door opens]

48:32.843 --> 48:34.245
Ellen!

48:34.279 --> 48:36.881

[grunting]

51:05.062 --> 51:06.597
Thought so.

51:09.434 --> 51:13.638
You're looking
for the others... like you.

51:15.873 --> 51:19.810
I haven't seen one of
your kind in 16 years

51:19.844 --> 51:22.012
since the last purge.

51:23.248 --> 51:27.918
Yeah, I remember
that night.

51:27.952 --> 51:29.720
I'll never forget it.

51:32.857 --> 51:37.061
Men from the town said they
got every last one of them.

51:41.366 --> 51:43.868
But that isn't
quite true, is it?

51:56.981 --> 51:59.550
Do you wanna know
where your mother is?

I'm fine!

53:09.454 --> 53:11.522
[baby crying]

53:20.531 --> 53:24.335
Any more of them
bastards back there?

53:24.369 --> 53:27.338
No, we got 'em all.

53:30.308 --> 53:33.511
Every last one of them.

53:37.248 --> 53:40.184
[baby cooing]

55:07.838 --> 55:09.039
What's going on?

55:09.073 --> 55:10.975
We found Lawrence..

55:12.142 --> 55:14.144
...and her dress
by his body.

55:38.703 --> 55:41.038
I'm sorry, Anna.

55:41.071 --> 55:43.474
I really
wanna understand.

55:48.145 --> 55:49.814
I'll be back.

57:21.105 --> 57:22.773

57:35.953 --> 57:41.025
Before I got you,
I had a dog.

57:42.392 --> 57:45.730
His name was Jasper.
Good dog.

57:45.763 --> 57:47.965
Always a bit of a rebel.

57:50.568 --> 57:54.371
But then after the night
I got you

57:54.404 --> 57:58.242
Jasper got crazier
and crazier.

58:00.177 --> 58:03.213
And then finally
one day he snapped.

58:05.783 --> 58:08.653
So I had to send him
to the better place..

58:10.420 --> 58:11.756
...you know.

58:16.927 --> 58:19.196
I swore an oath, Anna.

58:21.065 --> 58:23.467
That I would kill
the Wildlings.

58:25.636 --> 58:27.037
If I had been..

58:28.438 --> 58:30.841
...half the true hunter
Jasper was

58:31.976 --> 58:34.912
there would be no Anna..

58:34.945 --> 58:37.715
...and Jasper would still
be at my side.

58:45.455 --> 58:47.892
There's a better place
for you.

58:58.468 --> 59:00.504
Lift up your shirt.

59:07.311 --> 59:09.179
Find the place..

59:11.281 --> 59:13.150
...and put it in.

59:15.920 --> 59:20.290
Now, push it in.
Push it all the way in.

59:20.324 --> 59:23.861
Daddy, why didn't
you tell me

59:23.894 --> 59:25.830
that I'm a Wildling?

59:30.267 --> 59:32.369
I wanted to spare you.

59:34.038 --> 59:35.472
Why?

59:35.572 --> 59:36.907
(needle drops)

59:38.075 --> 59:40.177
Why did you spare me?

59:47.852 --> 59:50.287
Anna was a mistake..

59:55.660 --> 59:57.594
...and so is daddy.

01:00:02.199 --> 01:00:03.734
Roger.

Good morning, Anna.

01:00:54.284 --> 01:00:55.753
You okay under there?

01:00:57.287 --> 01:00:59.456
Come on get up, I need to
take you to the district..

01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:05.562
Ah! No! No! Anna!

01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:11.635
- Anna?
- Drive!

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:17.074
- Anna, seriously...
- Can you go a bit quicker, please?

01:01:17.107 --> 01:01:18.943
Where are we even going?

01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:21.445
- To the Northern Light.
- Seriously?

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:23.280
This is crazy.
I mean, you're a fugitive.

01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:25.582
No, I'm a Wildling.

01:01:26.884 --> 01:01:29.519
Why are you slowing down?

01:01:29.553 --> 01:01:31.655
Why are we stopping?

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:33.023
What is it, a Wildling?

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:35.425
- Keep driving!
- What is a Wildling, Anna?

01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:37.561
I wanna help you,
but you can't honestly

01:01:37.594 --> 01:01:39.830
think that we can just
steal a cop car like this.

01:01:39.864 --> 01:01:41.766
They can trace
this thing!

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:49.639
[indistinct radio chatter]

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:53.844

You're gonna get sick
in those wet clothes.

01:03:19.596 --> 01:03:22.766
Hey, come on, Anna.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:24.101
Get up.

Get the men.

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:49.479
I can't do that, Gabe.

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:52.116
Not if she's with the kid.

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:54.051
I ran into Cooper
this mornin'.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:58.822
I tell ya she's asking
too many questions.

01:05:58.855 --> 01:06:01.025
I'm not going to jail
for this, Gabe.

01:06:01.058 --> 01:06:02.592
Not for your mist..

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:05.129
You let her get away!

- What?

01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:24.734
If we follow the river, it's probably
gonna take us back to the lake.

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:26.970
From there, we can find
our way back to the car

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.505
and find Ellen.

- No fucking idea.

in the murder of

fellow high school class
mate Lawrence Fuller.

01:12:01.418 --> 01:12:04.053
Fuller was found dead at
a party three months ago

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:06.956
and his killer
is still at large.

01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:09.192
Anna was arrested shortly
after the murder

01:12:09.225 --> 01:12:11.628

and is still missing

not to take matters
into their own hands

as they fear this female
suspect may be dangerous.
