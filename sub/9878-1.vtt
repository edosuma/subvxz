00:39.873 --> 00:43.668
Long ago, a mythic
battle between good and evil

00:43.752 --> 00:46.546
played out in ancient China.

00:46.630 --> 00:49.173
The country was torn by civil war,

00:49.258 --> 00:52.468
with many kingdoms
struggling for land and power.

00:54.930 --> 01:00.893
But one king had a ruthless ambition
to make himself emperor by the sword.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.668
Leave me.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.879
Prepare for war!

01:29.757 --> 01:32.967
The other rulers hired assassins
to kill the King

01:33.051 --> 01:35.678
before he could conquer them all.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.844
Stop! l am not harmed.

02:24.770 --> 02:25.812
We attack tonight!

02:39.535 --> 02:44.121
Kingdom by kingdom,
his army swept away everything in its path,

02:44.206 --> 02:48.042
and anyone who resisted met a terrible fate.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.964
The country was his.

02:53.048 --> 02:56.217
He was now Emperor of All Under Heaven.

02:57.886 --> 03:02.640
He enslaved his conquered enemies
and forced them to build his Great Wall.

03:02.724 --> 03:06.644
When they were dead or useless,
he had them buried beneath it.

03:37.968 --> 03:42.179
The Emperor's mystics taught him
mastery over the five elements,

03:43.307 --> 03:47.268
fire, water, earth, wood and metal.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.687
His power seemed without limit.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.110
He was master of millions,

03:56.194 --> 03:59.989
but like the lowliest peasant,
he could not stop growing old.

04:01.199 --> 04:05.286
l have too much to do for one lifetime.

04:05.454 --> 04:09.457
He needed to defeat
his last enemy, death itself.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.051
One day, news came of a powerful witch

04:20.135 --> 04:23.679
who was rumored to know
the secret to eternal life.

04:23.764 --> 04:29.018
He ordered General Ming, his oldest friend
and trusted ally, to find her.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.698
The witch was named Zi Yuan,

04:42.783 --> 04:45.952
and she was nothing
like the General expected.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.629
Your Majesty...

05:02.344 --> 05:03.386
Rise up.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.226
l do not possess the secret of
immortality, my Lord...

05:10.310 --> 05:13.270
...but l know where to find it.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.773
General...

05:18.318 --> 05:20.111
No man is to touch her.

05:20.529 --> 05:24.031
She is mine.

05:29.037 --> 05:32.832
On the western border
stood the Monastery of Turfan.

05:32.916 --> 05:36.919
There was housed the greatest library
in the ancient world,

05:37.004 --> 05:41.215
and Zi Yuan was sure
the secret to eternal life was here.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.033
This is a key.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.878
It was the long lost
oracle bones,

06:18.962 --> 06:23.299
a collection of all the mystical secrets
of the ancient world.

06:23.383 --> 06:28.929
The Emperor's answer was here
along with other magic beyond imagining.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.026
You have served me well.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.865
I will grant you anything you desire.

06:49.326 --> 06:52.995
I want to spend my life with General Ming.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.832
Of course.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.459
Read.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.312
She cast the spell in Sanskrit,

07:18.396 --> 07:22.441
an ancient language
that the Emperor did not understand.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.616
I feel your spell working.

07:32.119 --> 07:37.873
I am now immortal.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.128
Come, l want to show you something.

07:57.769 --> 08:01.438
Become my queen and l will let him live.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.651
Do what he says! Save yourself!

08:09.656 --> 08:11.949
You will never keep your word.

08:13.577 --> 08:14.618
You are right.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.634
Now, join General Ming in hell.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.652
What did you do to me?

08:49.571 --> 08:51.780
I cursed you and your army.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.922
Surround the Palace!

09:08.048 --> 09:09.465
The Emperor is in trouble!

09:26.149 --> 09:28.400
The curse must never be lifted,

09:28.485 --> 09:32.988
or the Emperor will rise again
to enslave all of mankind.

09:33.114 --> 09:37.952
On that dark day,
there will be nothing and no one to save us.

09:52.509 --> 09:55.469
You can run, but you can't hide.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.269
One o'clock.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.104
OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND
1946

10:06.022 --> 10:10.859
Ten o'clock, one o'clock. Ten o'clock, one...

10:10.986 --> 10:13.862
And this is something for grown men to do?

10:23.206 --> 10:24.456
Come on.

10:33.216 --> 10:34.800
Bite on this.

10:52.402 --> 10:54.486
Evy, I'm home!

10:54.571 --> 10:57.656
Mrs. O'Connell is at her book reading, sir.
She'll be home for dinner.

10:57.741 --> 11:01.493
Oh, right. Well, that's great,
'cause we're having fish.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.498
You didn't think I'd catch anything,
did you?

11:06.583 --> 11:09.084
I had the utmost confidence, sir.

11:11.254 --> 11:16.008
There's a hook in your neck, sir.
Shall l fetch the wire cutters?

11:20.930 --> 11:26.060
Fall back! Follow me!
Move! Move! Move! Move!

11:30.607 --> 11:32.941
"Now safely aboard the airship
with the mummy finally vanquished,

11:33.068 --> 11:34.109
LONDON

11:35.195 --> 11:37.696
"Dash swept Scarlet into his arms.

11:37.947 --> 11:43.077
"'Oh, God, Scarlet, l thought I’d lost you.'
'For a moment there, you did.'

11:43.620 --> 11:46.372
"Bathed in rays of golden sunlight,

11:46.456 --> 11:51.543
"our heroes sealed their reunion
with a kiss of timeless passion,

11:51.628 --> 11:55.130
"their love deeper and truer than ever."

12:00.470 --> 12:04.139
Mrs. O'Connell, we're all dying to know,

12:04.224 --> 12:07.726
is the Scarlet O'Keefe character
really based on you?

12:09.312 --> 12:12.648
Honestly, l can say
she's a completely different person.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.733
- Any more questions?
- Mrs. O'Connell...

12:14.818 --> 12:19.321
Mrs. O'Connell, is your life today
as exciting as it was before the war?

12:21.157 --> 12:23.242
I wish my life were that exciting now.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.743
Will there be another book
in the series?

12:24.828 --> 12:27.413
Do you believe in happy endings?

12:30.500 --> 12:32.584
Isn't this blissful?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.588
Dinner at home.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.300
- Every night.
- Every night.

12:41.010 --> 12:44.930
- Here's to retirement.
- May we stay this happy forever.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.531
Still no letter from Alex.
I've sent him three in the last month.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.782
Yeah, well, what do you expect?

13:03.867 --> 13:04.950
The only time we ever hear from that kid

13:05.034 --> 13:07.286
is when he's getting kicked out of college
or he needs more money.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.372
I’m sure he's just buried in his studies.

13:16.713 --> 13:20.966
- So, how did your book reading go?
- Oh, fine. Thank you.

13:21.843 --> 13:24.803
Until they asked me, "When will there
be another Mummy adventure?"

13:24.888 --> 13:27.473
Yeah, but you did promise the publisher
a third book.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.640
I know.

13:28.725 --> 13:33.061
But l spend my nights staring
at a blank page, completely blocked.

13:33.146 --> 13:38.317
We could skip dinner, and l could

13:38.401 --> 13:43.697
attempt to inspire you upstairs.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.576
Oh, that's so sweet of you, darling.

13:47.702 --> 13:52.331
But I’m going to sit at that typewriter
until something exciting comes out.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.043
Thank you.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.839
Trout. How lovely!

14:04.677 --> 14:08.347
I’m so happy you found a hobby
that doesn't involve guns.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.857
NINGXIA Province, China

14:30.620 --> 14:32.079
Don't worry, we'll find the entrance today.

14:33.331 --> 14:36.124
Li Tung, what's for lunch?

14:36.251 --> 14:37.292
Noodle soup.

14:37.669 --> 14:39.127
Very good.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.302
Good. Wilson's back.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.931
You're a couple days late, Professor.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.516
l was beginning to think
you'd run into bandits.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.601
Oh, my dear fellow,
thank you for the concern.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.395
- Are you thirsty?
- Oh, yes, please.

14:56.479 --> 14:58.522
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.733
You know,
when l saw you standing up there,

15:01.818 --> 15:03.986
l thought l was looking at your father.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.821
You really are Rick O'Connell's son.

15:05.947 --> 15:10.742
Yeah, well, hopefully after today,
he'll be known as Alex O'Connell's father.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.537
What a powerful face!

15:13.663 --> 15:17.583
When l told my colleagues at the museum
that you had discovered the Colossus,

15:17.667 --> 15:19.251
they were thrilled.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.545
- Yes, however...
- l know.

15:21.671 --> 15:23.714
When am l gonna get in that tomb?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.841
Don't let the buggers get you down.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.343
It was you that discovered
the Bembridge journal,

15:28.469 --> 15:30.929
and with it, you'll discover the Emperor.

15:31.014 --> 15:34.808
- l have complete faith in you, Alex.
- Thank you, Professor.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.185
Thanks for believing in me.

15:39.397 --> 15:42.482
We found it! We found the door!

15:44.861 --> 15:46.528
Bad Mummy.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.406
Yeah.

15:50.992 --> 15:52.868
Vile Mummy?

15:55.330 --> 15:56.663
No. Cursed Mummy!

15:56.914 --> 15:59.666
Mysterious Mummy.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.046
Malignant Mummy.

16:08.384 --> 16:10.510
Prepare to die!

16:12.221 --> 16:13.722
Take that!

16:22.106 --> 16:23.398
Rick!

16:25.234 --> 16:27.235
Darling, where are you?

16:37.872 --> 16:40.082
I’m ready to be inspired.

16:46.881 --> 16:50.842
Do you remember the time
the mummy had me tied down?

16:50.927 --> 16:54.888
And you came to save me and you cut...

16:54.972 --> 16:59.226
No! You tore open the ropes
is what you did,

16:59.310 --> 17:02.145
just as he was about to plunge his...

17:04.816 --> 17:06.233
Oh, rats.

17:33.928 --> 17:35.345
Watch out!

17:42.311 --> 17:44.813
- Emperor didn't want any houseguests.
- Yeah.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.149
Stay together.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.509
Sir Colin Bembridge.

18:15.303 --> 18:16.720
Oh, gee...

18:17.555 --> 18:19.931
He went searching for this tomb
70 years ago.

18:20.016 --> 18:21.975
They left him like this as a warning.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.853
Unfortunately, this is not the dead man
that's gonna make us famous.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.688
Let's keep moving.

19:03.518 --> 19:04.893
Look at it, Alex.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.562
Look at it!

19:46.269 --> 19:47.727
Chu Wah!

20:31.314 --> 20:32.939
- Chu Wah.
- No, no, don't, don't, don't.

20:33.024 --> 20:35.734
Alex, Alex, they're dead! Come on.

20:35.818 --> 20:38.945
This kind of danger goes with the territory.
You know that better than anyone.

20:39.030 --> 20:40.322
Alex!

20:44.660 --> 20:46.202
- Yes?
- Okay.

20:46.329 --> 20:47.704
- Yes?
- Yeah.

20:48.372 --> 20:52.918
All right, good chap. Okay. Good chap.
Oh, Jesus.

20:58.090 --> 21:01.509
All the warriors are facing in to this point,

21:01.594 --> 21:04.930
- as if awaiting an order from the Emperor.
- Well, then, where is he?

21:05.014 --> 21:09.601
Listen, you don't think some bloody grave
robber's beaten us to the prize, do you?

21:09.685 --> 21:11.394
No, he's still here.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.689
You see, this is a feng shui compass.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.450
Okay. Now. This...

21:25.534 --> 21:27.452
Okay, this is true north,

21:27.536 --> 21:31.790
but the feng shui compass
is set in the opposite direction.

21:31.874 --> 21:33.959
- All right, we need to realign it.
- All right.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.127
- All right, here we go.
- All right.

21:58.901 --> 22:01.111
Alex! Alex, speak to me!

22:01.612 --> 22:03.405
Are you all right?

22:04.573 --> 22:07.075
- Alex!
- I’m fine.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.745
Tell me, have we found the Emperor?

22:14.583 --> 22:15.834
Alex!

22:23.634 --> 22:24.884
What is it?

22:24.969 --> 22:27.929
It's only the greatest find since King Tut!

22:31.767 --> 22:35.729
"lf he is awakened,
all mortals should despair."

22:35.813 --> 22:37.772
It’s definitely him!

22:42.111 --> 22:44.529
Even had his concubines buried alive
with him.

22:44.613 --> 22:45.989
Selfish bastard.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.743
Hey, Professor Wilson,
you want to come down and take a look?

22:49.827 --> 22:52.996
Or are you so overwhelmed you can't talk?

23:16.979 --> 23:18.313
Wilson!

24:29.301 --> 24:32.554
Let's go, Professor.
We've got a lot of work to do.

24:32.638 --> 24:33.721
All right.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.354
First of all, I’d just like to say

24:41.438 --> 24:44.691
that the Foreign Office appreciates
all that you did during the war.

24:44.775 --> 24:49.112
But I’ve been sent to offer you
one last assignment.

24:49.822 --> 24:54.200
I’m afraid we've retired
from the espionage game, haven't we, dear?

24:54.285 --> 24:56.452
Yeah, we've... We don't do that anymore.
We're finished.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.913
- Not at all.
- Completely done.

25:00.916 --> 25:04.127
But just out of curiosity,
what is the mission anyway?

25:04.253 --> 25:07.589
We need you to courier this to Shanghai.

25:11.010 --> 25:14.387
- Nice piece of ice.
- It’s the Eye of Shangri-La.

25:14.471 --> 25:17.974
lf you believe the legend,
it points the way to the Pool of Eternal Life.

25:18.100 --> 25:20.226
It was smuggled out of China in 1940.

25:20.311 --> 25:23.062
Now, the government would like
to return it to the Shanghai Museum

25:23.147 --> 25:26.566
as a sign of good faith
to the Chinese people.

25:26.650 --> 25:30.570
And with your expertise in the field,
we naturally thought of you.

25:30.654 --> 25:33.615
Oh, we'd be so flattered.

25:35.659 --> 25:39.495
But Rick and l, we made a promise
to each other after the war

25:39.622 --> 25:42.665
that we would settle down.

25:42.791 --> 25:45.585
- That's right, yeah, we did, didn't we? We...
- l see.

25:45.669 --> 25:48.588
Well, l must admit l am a little disappointed.

25:48.672 --> 25:52.091
Postwar China is very dangerous.

25:52.176 --> 25:57.096
There are a lot of factions that would love
to get their hands on the Eye of Shangri-La.

25:57.181 --> 26:00.808
In lesser hands,
the Eye could be lost forever.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.269
We couldn't let that happen, could we?

26:03.354 --> 26:05.772
No, that could be bad for the world.

26:05.856 --> 26:08.024
- The world... Terrible.
- Yeah.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.693
You know, she has a brother
who lives in Shanghai.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.612
- Jonathan!
- Yes.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.572
He owns a nightclub, if I’m not mistaken.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.115
We have been meaning to visit. We could...

26:16.200 --> 26:17.492
- We should...
- ...drop in and surprise him.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.244
- Say hello.
- Why not?

26:19.328 --> 26:22.664
Does this mean
we can count on you one last time?

26:23.999 --> 26:24.999
Yes.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.421
Shanghai, China

26:30.506 --> 26:32.507
Chinese NEW YEAR, 1947

26:59.368 --> 27:00.535
There we are.

27:02.204 --> 27:04.330
Here's to you, Princess.

27:04.415 --> 27:07.667
And Imhotep.
May the bugger actually stay dead.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.378
Ding-dong.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.930
Hi, can you buy a drink for me?

27:21.807 --> 27:24.726
Excuse me. Alex! Alex! You're back again.

27:24.810 --> 27:26.269
Come here, Alex. Let me get you a drink.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.896
Smooth special for the pup, huh?
The explorer.

27:31.066 --> 27:32.400
Make that two.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.028
Sorry, Uncle Jon, but l got a better offer.

27:35.112 --> 27:38.823
No, no, Alex. No, look.
Listen, how can l... Come here.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.700
To put it in archeological terms,

27:40.784 --> 27:42.994
that's a tomb
in which many pharaohs have lain.

27:43.078 --> 27:45.997
Now, listen, listen,
just think about me for a moment, all right?

27:46.081 --> 27:49.876
Your discovery will go public in a few days,
and your parents are sure to find out.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.503
They're not gonna be happy
you've dropped out of school. And...

27:52.588 --> 27:56.424
Will you relax, Uncle Jon? Okay? I’m here.
They're a long way away.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.344
- Alex...
- Excuse me, okay?

27:59.428 --> 28:01.763
l have some excavation to do.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.272
Jonathan!

28:15.486 --> 28:18.654
You're in China! Evy. Rick.

28:18.781 --> 28:21.115
What are you... It’s so...
l didn't even...

28:21.200 --> 28:24.410
Brother, how lovely to see you.

28:24.495 --> 28:26.245
l had no idea he was here!

28:26.330 --> 28:27.789
- Who was here?
- Who?

28:29.792 --> 28:31.834
This happens every time!

28:32.795 --> 28:34.921
Every man in the bar!

28:35.005 --> 28:36.089
- Dad?
- Alex!

28:36.173 --> 28:37.840
- l don't know what to do with you!
- He's just a boy!

28:37.966 --> 28:41.260
- l can't leave the room for 10 minutes!
- l didn't... Go away! Go to hell!

28:41.345 --> 28:43.388
- I’m sick of it!
- Let's go get lover-boy!

28:43.472 --> 28:45.431
I’m gonna kill you, kid!

28:45.516 --> 28:47.809
Not so fast, that's my kid.

28:49.853 --> 28:53.147
- Mad Dog Maguire?
- Ricochet O'Connell.

28:53.649 --> 28:56.109
- Hey, hey.
- What are you doing here?

28:56.193 --> 28:59.070
- Alex! Sweetheart! Are you all right?
- Just a little family get-together, folks.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.573
Come on,
let's get back to having a good time. Music!

29:03.075 --> 29:04.117
How long has it been?

29:04.201 --> 29:07.036
Egypt, '23. French Foreign Legion.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.373
This guy could land a plane
on anything, you...

29:10.499 --> 29:13.084
- Why are you here?
- Ricochet, he had his hands all over me girl.

29:13.168 --> 29:15.461
Now, son or no son,
l gotta give him a beating!

29:15.546 --> 29:17.880
- Get out of the way, Dad.
- Sit down.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.716
Now as much as I’d really like you
to teach him a valuable lesson...

29:20.843 --> 29:22.468
His mother would be upset! Very upset.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.095
You have a lot of explaining to do,
young man.

29:24.179 --> 29:25.388
l got a wife now, and a kid.

29:25.514 --> 29:27.640
Things are a little bit different,
I’m sure you understand.

29:27.724 --> 29:29.434
- Yeah.
- Let me make it up to you.

29:30.727 --> 29:32.854
We're just surprised to see you here.
That's all.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.355
Who's gonna pay
for all this damage?

29:34.440 --> 29:35.731
All right?

29:35.858 --> 29:36.858
I’m not here five minutes,

29:36.942 --> 29:38.818
and I’m already pulling your fanny
out of the fire.

29:38.902 --> 29:39.944
You're going back to college.

29:40.028 --> 29:43.197
How'd you think this was gonna work, Dad?
You two show up, tell me what to do?

29:43.282 --> 29:47.743
No. But we should sit down
and discuss this like a family.

29:47.870 --> 29:50.621
No offense, Mom,
but we haven't been a family in a long time.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.748
Hey, don't you turn your back on me. Alex!

29:52.875 --> 29:55.209
Alex, just... Alex, come here.

29:57.212 --> 29:58.713
Can you...

29:59.965 --> 30:02.175
Don't look at me like that.

30:08.056 --> 30:10.433
- It’s all your fault!
- My fault?

30:10.559 --> 30:12.226
You're the one
that's always smothering him.

30:12.311 --> 30:14.854
You couldn't leave him alone
for five minutes without wiping his nose.

30:14.938 --> 30:18.691
Perhaps l was overcompensating for the fact
that you never took an interest in his life.

30:18.775 --> 30:21.444
His life was my top priority.

30:21.570 --> 30:24.113
How many times did l save that kid
from breaking his neck?

30:24.239 --> 30:26.449
A little warmth and encouragement
would have been nice.

30:26.575 --> 30:29.243
I’m his father. It’s implied.

30:32.414 --> 30:36.250
We've spent our entire lives
searching for priceless artifacts,

30:36.335 --> 30:37.919
and the one thing
that's most precious to us,

30:38.003 --> 30:39.086
we've lost.

30:40.756 --> 30:45.760
We can't let Alex become some stranger
in pictures on our mantle.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.262
- We can't let that happen.
- No, we can't.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.473
How are we gonna fix this?

30:52.100 --> 30:54.268
We need to do it together.

31:00.776 --> 31:05.154
PARAMILITARY OUTPOST
WESTERN China

31:29.721 --> 31:32.515
The O'Connells are in Shanghai.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.601
Do they have the Eye of Shangri-La?

31:35.686 --> 31:38.062
Our spy says they do.

31:38.564 --> 31:39.647
Good.

31:39.815 --> 31:40.982
Assemble the troops!

31:41.066 --> 31:42.149
Yes sir.

31:46.655 --> 31:47.655
Soldiers!

31:48.240 --> 31:51.659
Soon all our training and sacrifice...

31:52.327 --> 31:54.870
will bear great fruit.

31:55.914 --> 31:59.166
It is my dream to raise our Emperor
from his tomb.

31:59.876 --> 32:03.004
Only He can bring order out of this chaos.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.089
Soldiers...

32:06.341 --> 32:10.011
tonight our great battle begins!

32:21.189 --> 32:24.692
You know, this might have been faster
if we took a rickshaw.

32:24.776 --> 32:27.111
It’s Chinese New Year.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.237
Don't you just love this country?

32:28.322 --> 32:31.699
They have so many extra little holidays,
and drinking is mandatory.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.368
l can't believe
we get to see your first big discovery.

32:34.453 --> 32:35.494
It’s so exciting.

32:35.579 --> 32:38.080
Well, after last night,
I’m surprised you want to see it at all.

32:39.541 --> 32:42.168
Listen,
I'll pick you up in about an hour.

32:42.252 --> 32:43.544
You're not coming?

32:43.629 --> 32:46.964
No, no,
I’ve seen enough mummies to last a lifetime.

32:58.268 --> 32:59.727
There he is.

33:00.354 --> 33:03.773
Oh, my darling, very impressive.

33:04.733 --> 33:06.442
When do you get to open the sarcophagus?

33:06.526 --> 33:08.569
Well,
after the official red tape has been cut.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.947
Do the words "rest in peace"
mean anything to you two?

33:12.032 --> 33:15.743
So, Mom, why don't you stick around
for the next few days,

33:15.827 --> 33:17.078
and we can open it together?

33:17.162 --> 33:18.579
l would like that very much, thanks.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.956
Alex, why don't you go
and tell Professor Wilson

33:21.041 --> 33:23.125
that we're here. You know...

33:23.210 --> 33:24.585
No problem. Great.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.838
Just don't wake the big guy up
while I’m gone.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.055
Hey, Alex.

33:36.682 --> 33:41.352
You know, this is all really, really big stuff.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.774
Whatever you say, Dad.

34:23.853 --> 34:25.103
What?

34:26.106 --> 34:31.152
You just have a certain glow about you
this evening l haven't seen in a long time.

34:32.654 --> 34:35.572
l guess mummies bring out the best in me.

34:36.783 --> 34:40.327
Take a wrong turn at Cairo?
Sorry to interrupt.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.914
- Roger.
- Professor Roger Wilson.

34:43.998 --> 34:45.331
Rick.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.960
You know, when Alex told me
that you had gone legit,

34:49.045 --> 34:51.088
l just couldn't believe my ears.

34:51.172 --> 34:54.884
Well, now l just pillage tombs
in the name of preservation. Evelyn.

34:54.967 --> 34:59.096
- Congratulations on your latest discovery.
- Alex deserves all the credit.

34:59.181 --> 35:01.265
He's one hell of a kid.
He's like the son l never had.

35:01.349 --> 35:02.683
And he's the only one we've got,

35:02.768 --> 35:04.810
so the next time you send him
on one of your field trips,

35:04.895 --> 35:06.187
you give us the heads-up first.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.647
Yes, yes, of course.

35:08.732 --> 35:12.151
And now, l believe you have
something that belongs to us.

35:12.235 --> 35:13.819
What's that?

35:13.904 --> 35:15.529
Oh, you mean this?

35:19.201 --> 35:20.701
I’m sorry...

35:22.329 --> 35:24.163
There, go ahead.

35:24.247 --> 35:26.040
All yours, Rog.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.585
l knew l could rely on you two.

35:31.213 --> 35:35.299
I’m afraid your work is not done yet,
Mr. and Mrs. O'Connell.

35:35.383 --> 35:39.303
I’d like to introduce you to a friend of mine.
General Yang.

35:39.387 --> 35:40.596
Roger!

35:41.056 --> 35:45.392
Well, he is the man who financed Alex's dig.
We're in this together.

35:46.269 --> 35:48.270
Cheek by jowl. General.

35:50.273 --> 35:51.774
Search him.

35:53.693 --> 35:57.822
No. The Eye belongs to the Chinese people.
You can't do this.

35:57.906 --> 36:02.409
So, Rog, you snake, how much did...

36:02.494 --> 36:05.287
Is it Yin and Yang? ...pay you?

36:05.372 --> 36:07.915
Enough to pull strings at the Foreign Office,

36:07.999 --> 36:12.419
make sure that it was you two
who delivered the Eye. Turn around.

36:12.504 --> 36:16.507
The Eye contains the elixir
from the Pool of Eternal Life.

36:18.593 --> 36:21.387
l need you to open it, Mrs. O'Connell.

36:22.639 --> 36:23.848
No.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.934
You're going to use it to wake the Emperor,
aren't you?

36:27.018 --> 36:31.188
And his Terracotta Army.
At least, that's the general idea.

36:31.273 --> 36:34.817
Raising an army of mummies is insane.
Listen, Yang...

36:38.530 --> 36:40.281
Easy! Go easy.

36:41.116 --> 36:44.243
Time to open the sarcophagus. Move!

36:48.790 --> 36:52.126
Read the inscription! Now!

37:00.218 --> 37:02.928
Ancient Chinese isn't my forte.

37:03.013 --> 37:06.557
Here's some encouragement. Wilson!

37:07.726 --> 37:08.767
I’ll do it!

37:08.852 --> 37:12.563
No, Evy, don't do it!
They're just gonna kill me, anyway.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.320
The inscription says
that only a drop of blood

37:19.404 --> 37:22.615
from a person of pure heart
can open the Eye.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.660
Your husband was right.

37:28.496 --> 37:30.039
No!

37:36.838 --> 37:41.383
Only the pure of heart would sacrifice
themselves for the one they love.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.261
Open it.

37:49.225 --> 37:52.144
You never called after our last date.

37:52.228 --> 37:54.563
l don't have time for games, Alex.

37:54.648 --> 37:58.025
You know my name, but l don't know yours.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.318
It’s Lin.

37:59.402 --> 38:02.947
You want to explain to me
why you tried to kill me?

38:03.031 --> 38:04.156
We could do that.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.033
Or we could save your parents.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.707
Wilson, you son of a bitch!

39:06.011 --> 39:09.388
- Get on with it, O'Connell.
- All right.

39:28.366 --> 39:33.912
Once this touches him,
the Emperor will rise to rule again.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.040
Finish him off.

40:15.622 --> 40:17.998
Alex, please! Don't. That's...

40:18.583 --> 40:20.834
Don't, don't. Don't, please.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.587
No, don't, Alex, it's me. Please.

40:24.047 --> 40:27.800
It’s not him. This is a eunuch! It’s a decoy!

40:29.803 --> 40:31.845
Where the hell's the Emperor?

40:58.164 --> 40:59.414
Stay!

41:18.268 --> 41:19.935
Here we go again.

41:32.240 --> 41:34.116
l live to serve you, my Lord.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.784
l can help you become immortal.

41:35.869 --> 41:38.704
lf you are lying, you will burn.

41:55.305 --> 41:59.558
Wait! Wait! You wait for me!
I’m coming with you! Wait, wait...

42:25.460 --> 42:26.835
Watch out!

42:32.133 --> 42:36.053
We got to put this mummy down fast!
The longer we wait, the stronger they get!

42:36.137 --> 42:38.472
Open the gate! Open the gate!

42:45.813 --> 42:49.650
Yeah, yeah, yeah, l know. Sorry, pal.
There's a mummy on the loose.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.026
- You wanna drive?
- Why not?

42:51.110 --> 42:52.903
God, l love a woman who can drive a truck.

42:52.987 --> 42:56.073
Hey, pal, I’m really sorry,
but you know what? Happy New Year!

42:56.407 --> 42:57.699
Hit it, honey!

43:03.039 --> 43:04.748
No! Move over!

43:06.042 --> 43:07.709
What? No!

43:07.794 --> 43:09.127
No!

43:16.219 --> 43:17.552
No!

43:19.097 --> 43:21.640
- What?
- Jonathan, get in the back!

43:22.976 --> 43:24.101
Sorry about the Rolls!

43:24.185 --> 43:26.603
You guys are like mummy magnets!

43:28.273 --> 43:30.857
- We have to turn you around!
- Okay.

43:36.739 --> 43:38.156
Excuse me.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.328
- Hey, we could use this!
- Give me that!

43:45.665 --> 43:49.084
- Oh, yeah, that's a better idea.
- Size counts!

43:49.168 --> 43:52.087
Stop mucking about! They're getting away!

43:53.006 --> 43:54.756
Just drive!

43:55.425 --> 43:57.634
- Aim for the Emperor!
- Aim for the Emperor?

43:57.719 --> 44:00.387
- Light it up, Jonathan!
- I’m trying!

44:00.471 --> 44:01.596
Fire!

44:22.243 --> 44:23.744
Did we get him?

44:23.828 --> 44:25.954
- Fire!
- What, again?

44:26.039 --> 44:27.956
- Your ass is on fire!
- My ass?

44:28.041 --> 44:29.916
- Hold still!
- Rick, my ass is on fire!

44:30.001 --> 44:31.460
- Well, spank my...
- I’m putting it out!

44:31.544 --> 44:33.295
- Put me out, Rick!
- Just hold still!

44:33.379 --> 44:35.672
Spank my ass! Spank my ass!

44:35.757 --> 44:37.716
All right, here l come!

44:40.678 --> 44:42.471
Give me your hand!

44:48.686 --> 44:49.728
Come on!

44:50.313 --> 44:51.730
Watch out!

44:52.648 --> 44:53.774
Evy, where are you going?

44:53.858 --> 44:55.984
- Taking a short cut!
- Evy!

45:05.453 --> 45:07.496
- l told you it was a short cut!
- Right!

45:07.580 --> 45:09.456
Now he's chasing us!

45:13.961 --> 45:15.212
Hurry!

45:16.381 --> 45:19.049
Give me your hand.
Here, you're gonna need these.

45:19.133 --> 45:21.009
- Don't wait up for me.
- Where are you going?

45:21.094 --> 45:22.219
Out!

45:28.351 --> 45:31.019
- Where's Rick?
- Where do you think?

45:37.235 --> 45:38.610
Damn it!

45:42.740 --> 45:44.241
You're mine!

45:49.414 --> 45:53.041
- Give me your hand and get on this horse!
- Get back, Dad!

45:53.126 --> 45:58.088
Alexander Rupert O'Connell, you get
on the back of this horse this instant!

46:07.473 --> 46:11.643
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Oh, God!

46:18.901 --> 46:20.068
Evy!

46:21.154 --> 46:22.737
We've got to go back and help Rick!

46:22.822 --> 46:25.699
Rick! Forget Rick!
Here they come!

46:34.250 --> 46:35.917
I’ll go after the Emperor.

46:36.002 --> 46:38.753
Trust me. I’ve got a little more experience
with mummies.

46:38.838 --> 46:42.340
And l have the only weapon
that can kill him.

46:42.425 --> 46:44.843
Okay. I’ll cover you. Let's go!

46:53.186 --> 46:54.352
Lin!

47:12.079 --> 47:14.789
- l thought you were dead!
- He missed.

47:41.776 --> 47:43.193
Look out!

48:29.448 --> 48:33.994
- Thanks, Rick. Could you get the cab?
- Does it look like l have a wallet?

48:53.014 --> 48:55.765
You know, l would have killed the Emperor
if you two hadn't blown my cover.

48:55.850 --> 48:57.100
l had everything under control.

48:57.184 --> 48:59.436
Oh, yeah, that's exactly
what we were thinking.

48:59.520 --> 49:01.354
Yeah, well, good going,
you raised another mummy.

49:01.439 --> 49:03.398
And this bugger's got superpowers.

49:03.482 --> 49:06.735
He's got control over fire, water,
metal and who knows what else.

49:06.819 --> 49:07.902
And you dug him up anyway.

49:07.987 --> 49:09.738
Yeah, well, you're not gonna
pin this one on me, okay, Dad?

49:09.822 --> 49:12.073
- Am l?
- Oh, stop it, you two.

49:12.158 --> 49:15.577
No one's to blame here.
Wilson manipulated all of us.

49:15.661 --> 49:16.786
Yeah, that's true.

49:16.871 --> 49:18.955
l apologize for my parents.

49:19.040 --> 49:21.875
But l thought we worked
really well together.

49:22.376 --> 49:24.127
Except we failed.

49:26.339 --> 49:29.633
I’m sorry,
we haven't been properly introduced.

49:29.717 --> 49:32.302
- Who are you exactly?
- My name is Lin.

49:32.386 --> 49:35.764
My family has watched
over the Emperor's tomb for centuries.

49:35.848 --> 49:40.185
The Emperor cannot be killed unless
he is stabbed through the heart with this.

49:40.269 --> 49:42.979
My mother put a curse on it long ago.

49:44.357 --> 49:45.398
Mmm-hmm.

49:46.359 --> 49:48.985
Well, a quick family meeting, Alex.

49:50.738 --> 49:52.280
- Sit.
- Down.

49:54.325 --> 49:56.326
What do you really know about this girl?

49:56.410 --> 50:01.164
Well, not much, but after her help tonight,
I’m willing to go on a little faith.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.124
- Faith.
- Time is running out.

50:03.209 --> 50:05.710
You don't really believe in the concept
of personal space, do you?

50:05.795 --> 50:09.297
lf the Emperor reaches Shangri-La
and drinks from the Pool of Eternal Life,

50:09.382 --> 50:12.258
he will raise his army
and no one will be safe.

50:12.343 --> 50:14.886
Much as I’d like to stay
this boyishly handsome forever,

50:14.970 --> 50:16.429
Shangri-La is a crock.

50:16.514 --> 50:18.473
Yeah, but that's what you used to say
about mummies, too, Jon.

50:18.557 --> 50:20.684
- You did pretty well off it.
- Good point.

50:20.768 --> 50:25.188
The Gateway to Shangri-La lies in
a mountain pass high in the Himalayas.

50:25.272 --> 50:27.440
Beyond it is a golden tower.

50:27.525 --> 50:31.236
Once the diamond is placed at the top,
it will point the way to Shangri-La.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.363
Yang still has the diamond,

50:33.447 --> 50:36.449
and that's where
he and the Emperor will go.

50:36.992 --> 50:38.034
She's right.

50:38.119 --> 50:41.204
All the legends of the Eye
mention the Gateway.

50:41.288 --> 50:43.456
l like her, Alex. She knows what's what.

50:43.541 --> 50:49.045
Now, just say that we were to believe you,
could you guide us there?

50:49.130 --> 50:52.549
Yes. l have been there once.
l remember the way.

50:55.386 --> 50:57.846
Himalayas. We're going to need a plane.

50:57.930 --> 51:00.724
Well, l know just the Mad Dog for the job.

51:04.103 --> 51:07.021
Well, any self-respecting pilot
would land on the valley floor,

51:07.106 --> 51:08.857
but l don't have any self-respect,

51:08.941 --> 51:11.192
so I’ll put you down
halfway up the mountain.

51:11.277 --> 51:13.027
That should give us a good advantage.

51:13.112 --> 51:15.196
Of course,
l can't guarantee any of us will live.

51:15.281 --> 51:16.489
Great!

51:20.244 --> 51:24.122
I’d tell you to fasten your seatbelts,
but l was too cheap to buy any!

51:26.917 --> 51:29.294
- Why am l laughing?
- Here we go!

51:30.254 --> 51:33.506
Mad Dog, Mad Dog!
Ease up, ease up, ease up!

51:33.883 --> 51:35.341
Oh, God!

51:43.100 --> 51:44.851
Maguire!

51:46.520 --> 51:48.104
Come on, man!

51:48.564 --> 51:49.814
Mad Dog!

52:02.286 --> 52:03.953
Brake! No, no! Nobody move.

52:04.038 --> 52:06.790
Nobody move, nobody move!

52:20.221 --> 52:22.472
What is that God-awful smell?

52:23.808 --> 52:25.475
The yak yakked.

52:29.897 --> 52:32.232
Welcome to the modern world, my Lord.

52:32.775 --> 52:34.692
Why did you raise me?

52:35.110 --> 52:39.322
l love this land.
Only you can lead us back to greatness.

52:40.199 --> 52:42.575
What is in it for you?

52:44.161 --> 52:46.955
l want to serve as your general.

52:47.665 --> 52:50.124
The last general l trusted...

52:50.417 --> 52:53.211
betrayed me.

52:53.796 --> 52:56.548
l will not make that mistake.

53:02.972 --> 53:07.517
l cannot escape this curse
until l am immortal...

53:08.310 --> 53:09.811
General.

53:11.522 --> 53:13.523
l understand, my Lord.

53:13.816 --> 53:17.694
We need to find the Pool of Eternal Life.

53:18.571 --> 53:22.448
This will point the way.

53:43.888 --> 53:45.638
Can't you see it's Mr. McGuire

53:45.723 --> 53:47.557
come to court your sister Kate

53:47.641 --> 53:51.728
You know very well he owns the farm
a wee bit out...

54:04.074 --> 54:07.243
Delta-Tango-Alpha
to Ricochet. Come in, Ricochet.

54:09.246 --> 54:11.748
Delta-Tango-Alpha, this is Ricochet.
Go ahead, Mad Dog.

54:11.832 --> 54:14.292
Yeah, you know that Yang fellow
you told me to keep me eye out for?

54:14.376 --> 54:15.585
He's just shown up.

54:15.669 --> 54:17.921
Ricochet out. Thanks, Mad Dog.

54:18.005 --> 54:19.672
That's us, people! Let's go!

54:19.757 --> 54:21.591
- Jonathan, wake up!
- What...

54:31.352 --> 54:32.936
Hold the line!

54:36.440 --> 54:37.607
Good, we're a little more than halfway.

54:37.691 --> 54:41.235
We're gonna...
We're gonna camp up there for the night.

54:53.999 --> 54:58.252
Lin says if we leave at first light,
we'll reach the Gateway by noon.

54:59.797 --> 55:03.758
Did she happen to mention how she knows
so much about the Gateway?

55:03.842 --> 55:06.636
No, not really. Kind of mysterious.

55:07.429 --> 55:10.181
She's certainly managed to enchant you.

55:12.351 --> 55:15.019
Come on, Alex. You obviously like her.

55:16.939 --> 55:20.566
Mom, the thin mountain air,
clearly messing with your head.

55:22.444 --> 55:24.654
Whatever secret she's hiding,

55:25.906 --> 55:28.032
l just don't want to see you get hurt.

55:28.117 --> 55:31.577
l appreciate that, but, you know,

55:31.662 --> 55:35.707
I’ve had my fair share of experience
with the opposite sex.

55:35.791 --> 55:36.958
Really?

55:38.711 --> 55:41.504
How many experiences
are we talking about?

55:42.798 --> 55:48.011
Well, you shouldn't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to, okay, Mom?

55:48.095 --> 55:49.220
Right.

55:50.347 --> 55:52.223
Hey, Mom.

55:54.226 --> 55:57.854
I’m sorry l blamed you guys
for raising the Emperor.

56:09.033 --> 56:10.700
What's so funny?

56:13.912 --> 56:18.291
My mother is under the impression
there's something between us.

56:18.375 --> 56:20.376
l hope nothing romantic.

56:23.380 --> 56:26.966
Yeah, well, l told her there
was no chance of that.

56:27.051 --> 56:29.427
We're complete opposites,
you and me, right?

56:29.511 --> 56:34.557
You guard tombs. l raid them.
You like ancient knives. I’m into guns.

56:35.267 --> 56:37.727
Those are some
pretty insurmountable odds.

56:37.811 --> 56:40.063
- Absolutely.
- Well, good.

56:40.939 --> 56:45.151
Now that we've cleared that up,
we can focus on taking down the Emperor.

56:45.235 --> 56:46.861
l agree totally.

56:49.490 --> 56:52.200
Besides, you're not my type.

56:55.162 --> 56:59.290
Of course not. You don't like a woman
who can knock you on your backside.

57:01.585 --> 57:04.003
The expression is "kick my ass."

57:05.005 --> 57:07.507
And for the record, you didn't.

57:10.219 --> 57:13.471
Yeah, it's not easy being me, you know.

57:13.555 --> 57:15.264
Then again, l don't suppose
it's easy being you,

57:15.349 --> 57:17.517
is it, Geraldine, old girl?

57:17.601 --> 57:19.811
lf I’d met a girl like you, Geraldine...

57:19.895 --> 57:22.814
You know, hard-working,
you don't say much,

57:23.857 --> 57:27.276
you're a little bit hairy, but l don't mind that.

57:38.372 --> 57:40.623
There it is! We found it!

57:48.590 --> 57:50.633
The Gateway of Shangri-La!

57:58.142 --> 58:02.103
Go, girl! Go! You're free!

58:02.187 --> 58:05.398
Go, Geraldine! Live free!

58:15.576 --> 58:18.286
What did you do now? Rob an armory?

58:19.454 --> 58:21.831
Have you ever seen a Walther P38?

58:21.915 --> 58:24.167
Looks pretty anemic
compared to the Peacekeeper.

58:24.251 --> 58:27.628
Well, it's not about size, Dad.
It’s about stamina.

58:30.132 --> 58:31.674
You want power?

58:33.093 --> 58:38.181
l give you the Thompson submachine gun.
Fifty rounds a drum.

58:38.265 --> 58:41.434
- Twenty-five a mag.
- Tommy's good, Dad,

58:41.518 --> 58:43.227
but the cocking mechanism always jams.

58:43.312 --> 58:47.690
Here. Check out the Russian PPS
Personal Assault Weapon.

58:47.774 --> 58:49.483
Now, this is the future right here.

58:49.610 --> 58:52.945
You know, it's experience that wins the day.
It’s not all about firepower.

58:53.030 --> 58:54.989
Boys! lf l may...

58:55.115 --> 58:56.949
Do we have a plan for the Emperor?

58:57.034 --> 58:58.993
Yeah. We're gonna hit him
high, hard and fast

58:59.119 --> 59:00.828
and smash him like a Ming vase.

59:00.954 --> 59:04.040
- And if that doesn't work?
- We go to plan B.

59:04.124 --> 59:07.293
Plan B! You go upstairs,
you blow up that gold tower thing.

59:07.377 --> 59:09.503
- You light it up. We blow the guy sky high!
- Me?

59:09.630 --> 59:10.630
- You! What?
- Dad?

59:10.714 --> 59:12.840
So if the explosion doesn't kill us,
the avalanche will.

59:12.966 --> 59:14.425
- You got a better idea?
- Yeah. l do.

59:14.509 --> 59:16.385
l say we ambush him
with long-range rifles and silencers.

59:16.470 --> 59:17.553
Long-range, that's a better idea.

59:17.638 --> 59:18.721
Yeah, we can get in close, Dad.

59:18.805 --> 59:19.931
- Much better idea.
- And then we can finish him off

59:20.015 --> 59:21.641
- with Lin's dagger.
- Look, I’m sorry,

59:21.725 --> 59:24.393
l just don't put much faith
in your girlfriend's magic dagger.

59:24.478 --> 59:26.687
- Okay, Dad, she is not my girlfriend.
- You say that now,

59:26.813 --> 59:28.856
- but l still don't trust her.
- Well, l do.

59:28.982 --> 59:31.651
- So you should trust my judgment, okay?
- Look, kid,

59:31.735 --> 59:33.402
I’ve put down more mummies
in my time than you.

59:33.487 --> 59:34.904
You put down one mummy, Dad.

59:34.988 --> 59:38.199
Yeah. Same mummy twice!

59:42.704 --> 59:45.498
Hand me the green wire,
will you, please?

59:46.500 --> 59:48.417
Are you sure you know what you are doing?

59:48.502 --> 59:50.670
Of course. I’ve done this a hundred times.

59:50.754 --> 59:54.340
lf the Emperor places the Eye up there,
all will be lost.

01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:09.939
Clear a path to the Golden Tower.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:13.526
Prove yourself to me.

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:29.458
Let's give a warm O'Connell welcome!

01:00:33.755 --> 01:00:34.922
Fire!

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:49.312
Bazooka!

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:55.901
Fall back!

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:07.621
Alex! Follow me!

01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:24.764
We gotta take out those bazookas!

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:27.975
Go!

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.443
Fall back!

01:01:37.944 --> 01:01:40.029
Move! Move! Move! Move!

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.997
Time to go to plan B! Blow up the tower!

01:01:50.123 --> 01:01:51.957
Hey, I’m actually a little bit concerned
about plan B!

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.459
Couldn't we go straight to plan C?

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:56.170
Just make it go bang! I’ll cover you!

01:01:57.339 --> 01:01:58.631
Come on.

01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:01.717
All right, let's go, go, go!
Come on, come on!

01:02:01.802 --> 01:02:03.636
Come on. Oh, be good.

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:24.990
Set up a crossfire!

01:02:25.659 --> 01:02:26.951
Move it!

01:02:35.335 --> 01:02:37.002
My last round!

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:04.864
- Abominable snowmen?
- The Tibetans call them yeti!

01:03:09.035 --> 01:03:10.411
Please! l need your help!

01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:12.705
These soldiers are evil!

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:16.667
She speaks Yeti?

01:03:33.226 --> 01:03:34.894
Shoot! Kill them!

01:03:42.736 --> 01:03:45.571
Why do l always have to save the day?

01:03:46.198 --> 01:03:47.531
l hate it when the kid's right!

01:03:51.745 --> 01:03:53.412
Get the other guy!

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:55.581
Thanks!

01:04:20.941 --> 01:04:22.274
Trouble!

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:04.358
You can die slow or you can die fast.

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:28.841
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:05:30.176 --> 01:05:32.678
Yeah! l did it!

01:05:33.346 --> 01:05:37.683
Oh, Mother, l did it!
Time for a retreat, l think.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:47.860
I’m on your team! I’m a team player!
"One for all and all for me" kind of thing!

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:52.364
The dynamite, all this dynamite!
We should get out of here!

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:09.715
Back off! Back off!

01:06:10.050 --> 01:06:11.634
Run!

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:43.040
l hate mummies!
They never play fair!

01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:53.425
Dad! Dad, what are you doing?

01:07:01.101 --> 01:07:04.728
Over here! Over here! Come on! Over here!

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:06.897
Oh, no!

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:13.612
Rick!

01:07:42.058 --> 01:07:43.976
Shangri-La.

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:54.445
That's a diamond.

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:58.490
l could use a diamond like that.

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.514
Dad!

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.939
Okay, hold it. Hold on there, Dad.

01:08:32.024 --> 01:08:35.194
All right, please, please, please
put pressure on it, okay, Dad?

01:08:35.278 --> 01:08:38.613
It’s all right, it's all right.
We've been in tougher scrapes than this.

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:46.788
Avalanche!

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:21.532
- Help! Help me!
- Lin!

01:09:26.578 --> 01:09:28.080
Please! Help me!

01:10:09.831 --> 01:10:11.206
Yes!

01:10:12.542 --> 01:10:15.085
I’ve got it! And I’m still alive!

01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:21.508
Help me, please.
Somebody help me!

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:25.095
- We're over here! Over here!
- Alex?

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:27.764
- Mom, Mom, we're down here!
- Alex?

01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:29.558
We're over here!

01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:43.238
Oh, God.

01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:48.535
We've got to take him to Shangri-La now!
It’s our only chance.

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.473
We made it!

01:11:27.367 --> 01:11:28.784
The Pool.

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:41.046
Mother.

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:43.590
My sweet daughter.

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:53.558
l beg you...

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.187
My father is dying.

01:11:57.647 --> 01:11:58.939
They are my friends.

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:01.316
Oh, please.

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:39.021
Thank you.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:43.483
He must rest. We'll take him to my chamber.

01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:05.005
Where are you going, General?
Our destiny awaits.

01:13:10.178 --> 01:13:14.890
Well, it's not everyone that gets
their brother-in-law back from the dead.

01:13:15.516 --> 01:13:18.852
Yeah, give me my four score years
and ten any day.

01:13:23.858 --> 01:13:25.734
Is this Shangri-La?

01:13:35.703 --> 01:13:38.538
l could live here. Lots of opportunity.

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:42.000
A casino.

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:50.258
l was wrong to involve you in my revenge.

01:13:50.802 --> 01:13:52.302
No, mother.

01:13:53.387 --> 01:13:55.555
l would do anything for you.

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:07.234
He's resting well. Thank you.

01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:11.404
How'd you get involved in all this?

01:14:11.489 --> 01:14:16.535
The Emperor murdered the only man
l ever loved, Lin's father.

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:20.872
l would have died, too, by his hand,

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:24.876
if the yeti had not found me
and brought me to this pool.

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:28.046
Hang on a second.
How did this all happen?

01:14:28.131 --> 01:14:30.090
This was before Christ.

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:35.846
How long were you guarding his tomb?

01:14:35.930 --> 01:14:37.597
Over 2,000 years.

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:46.064
The Emperor must never be
allowed to reach the Pool,

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:49.067
or he will have the power to raise his army.

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:50.777
And once he becomes immortal,

01:14:50.862 --> 01:14:54.906
he can transform himself into
the most hideous creatures ever seen.

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:57.951
l will take the first watch at the entrance.

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:08.211
You know, l have no problem
dating an older woman.

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:13.425
I’m afraid we can't be together.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.928
Wait. What? Why?

01:15:18.639 --> 01:15:21.183
Because I’m going to live forever.

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:24.269
l don't want to watch you die.

01:15:25.188 --> 01:15:27.063
So what? That's it?

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:31.067
You're just gonna sit
on the sidelines for eternity?

01:15:31.152 --> 01:15:34.237
My mother has mourned
my father for centuries.

01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:37.532
l don't know if my heart can bear it.

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:45.373
People can live an entire lifetime
in one look.

01:15:47.585 --> 01:15:50.086
l watch my parents do it every day.

01:15:53.174 --> 01:15:54.341
Alex?

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:58.303
Your father's awake. Get up here!

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:12.400
Hello.

01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:18.448
lf this is heaven, it looks pretty good so far.

01:16:26.666 --> 01:16:29.251
Nice to see some things never change.

01:16:47.353 --> 01:16:49.854
Go easy on him. He feels terrible.

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:58.029
When l saw you lying there, Dad...

01:16:58.364 --> 01:17:01.241
I’ve never been so scared in my life.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:05.078
Well, that makes two of us.

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:09.082
l mean, you know,
you're not supposed to die, you know?

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:11.209
You're Ricochet O'Connell, right?

01:17:11.294 --> 01:17:14.546
You get beat up, you get tossed around,

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.257
but, well, you're always standing there
in the end.

01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:20.552
l never really thought of
the world without you.

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:25.682
Alex,

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:29.394
the truth is,

01:17:31.856 --> 01:17:33.606
I’m just trying to...

01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:37.652
I’m just...

01:17:37.737 --> 01:17:38.945
I’m trying to be a good husband.

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:40.405
I’m trying to be a good parent.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:44.075
And the truth is,
I’ve been dropping the ball lately, and...

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:47.120
No, you know, l haven't been
the world's greatest son, you know?

01:17:47.246 --> 01:17:51.249
No, no, that's 'cause you get it
from her side of the family.

01:17:51.334 --> 01:17:52.751
Come here.

01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:57.756
My boys.

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:05.138
You look tired, you should rest.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.307
I’ll stay.

01:18:08.476 --> 01:18:10.643
Fate is about to deal its final hand.

01:18:10.978 --> 01:18:13.271
lf we are to defeat the Emperor...

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:17.192
l must ask for one more sacrifice.

01:18:17.610 --> 01:18:18.860
Anything, mother.

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.864
Your immortality.

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:37.462
Oh, no! His powers have been fully restored!

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.880
Time to go.

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:04.864
General Ming's daughter.

01:19:05.699 --> 01:19:08.034
Your child will be mine.

01:19:16.836 --> 01:19:18.837
He is immortal.

01:19:47.533 --> 01:19:50.785
Hey! You three-headed shape-shifting
son of a bitch!

01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:02.547
Lin!

01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:14.767
Alex!

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:19.481
Alex!

01:20:28.657 --> 01:20:30.867
He's taking her back to his tomb
to raise his army!

01:20:30.951 --> 01:20:34.078
- Is there a faster way down from here?
- The yeti. They'll help.

01:20:34.163 --> 01:20:36.247
But he's already in the air. it’ll be too late!

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:40.502
Mad Dog can outfly a three-headed lizard
any day of the week! Let's go.

01:20:45.925 --> 01:20:47.800
Portside! Nine o'clock!

01:20:55.017 --> 01:20:57.685
Rick? Should l quit drinking?

01:21:03.609 --> 01:21:04.609
Jonathan to Rick.

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:06.694
You'd better get a move on if
you're gonna beat him to the tomb!

01:21:06.779 --> 01:21:09.489
Yeah, yeah, just get back here as fast
as you can with the reinforcements.

01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:11.324
No sightseeing!

01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:15.620
Here, Dad.

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:16.746
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:17.997
Nice.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:22.794
The Terracotta Army is not indestructible
until it crosses the Great Wall.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:26.256
That's comforting. How exactly are we
supposed to fend them off?

01:21:26.340 --> 01:21:27.590
When the Emperor built the Wall,

01:21:27.675 --> 01:21:29.050
he buried his enemies underneath it

01:21:29.134 --> 01:21:31.553
and cursed their souls
to hold it up for eternity.

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:36.558
Most of them were conquered soldiers.
l will call them to battle once again.

01:21:36.642 --> 01:21:42.146
Unlock an altar, raise an army.
That sounds like a plan. Let's go.

01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:10.300
Grab her.

01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:12.677
Guard her with your life.

01:22:15.806 --> 01:22:17.015
Alex?

01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:21.853
- Where'd he go?
- Where do you think?

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:41.247
AWAKE!

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:19.637
Today you awake to a world...

01:24:20.347 --> 01:24:22.724
in the grip of chaos and corruption.

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:24.892
Open the gates of the past

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:27.520
and free the souls
of the wrongfully damned.

01:24:28.272 --> 01:24:30.148
l will restore order...

01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:33.151
l will retake what is mine.

01:24:33.819 --> 01:24:36.487
l will crush any idea of freedom.

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:39.699
In the name of the ancestors
and the righteous,

01:24:39.825 --> 01:24:43.161
l sacrifice my immortality
and that of my daughter

01:24:43.287 --> 01:24:45.163
so that you may rise this day!

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:47.165
l will slaughter without mercy.

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:50.001
l will conquer without compassion.

01:24:50.335 --> 01:24:52.670
l will now lead you past the Great Wall.

01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:56.632
Once you cross, you will be indestructible.

01:24:57.551 --> 01:25:02.722
Bring down the wrath of the oppressed
on this Emperor and all who follow him!

01:25:03.223 --> 01:25:05.349
l raised you for one purpose...

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:08.394
to enforce my will on the entire world!

01:25:09.062 --> 01:25:10.521
Long live the Emperor!

01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:16.486
l call upon the hundreds and the thousands

01:25:16.570 --> 01:25:21.449
that you may rise up and seize this moment
to take your victory,

01:25:21.533 --> 01:25:25.369
to take your justice
and to take your revenge!

01:25:44.389 --> 01:25:45.890
Zi Yuan.

01:25:52.272 --> 01:25:53.898
It’s General Ming!

01:25:54.358 --> 01:25:55.942
Follow General Ming!

01:26:00.239 --> 01:26:03.407
Prepare for battle!

01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:15.586
These are...
They're good undead guys, right?

01:26:16.129 --> 01:26:19.173
Oh, no, no, no!

01:26:19.258 --> 01:26:21.551
Zi Yuan! Zi Yuan! Zi Yuan sent us!

01:26:21.635 --> 01:26:25.888
- Darling, l don't think he speaks English.
- We're with Zi Yuan!

01:26:25.973 --> 01:26:27.265
Zi Yuan?

01:26:27.808 --> 01:26:29.100
Right.

01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:32.061
Let's go.

01:26:33.063 --> 01:26:34.397
To battle!

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.088
Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

01:27:01.925 --> 01:27:03.467
Archers form up!

01:27:07.681 --> 01:27:08.973
incoming!

01:27:22.279 --> 01:27:26.365
- Hey! That's my favorite blue shirt.
- I’ve always hated that shirt.

01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:44.258
Death to General Ming!

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:49.680
Charge!

01:27:59.858 --> 01:28:02.026
Welcome to the 20th century!

01:28:18.877 --> 01:28:21.295
We can't let them cross the wall!

01:29:48.008 --> 01:29:49.467
You are no longer immortal.

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:33.177
Honey! Fall back to higher ground!

01:30:39.851 --> 01:30:42.186
l really hate mummies!

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:44.605
It seems the feeling's mutual!

01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:50.528
Shut up, clay boy! Fore!

01:30:51.113 --> 01:30:52.279
Run!

01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:06.794
- Catch!
- Got it!

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:13.217
Next time l say, "We've been in tougher
scrapes than this," l mean this!

01:31:38.910 --> 01:31:42.204
Die, you mummy bastards! Die!

01:31:42.289 --> 01:31:45.332
There is no call for bad language!

01:31:47.586 --> 01:31:50.838
Jonathan certainly knows
how to make an entrance!

01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:19.241
Any regrets, darling?

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:23.329
None. Not ever.

01:32:32.756 --> 01:32:35.674
- You okay?
- Yeah, sure, no problem.

01:32:35.759 --> 01:32:38.260
We had it completely under control.

01:32:41.097 --> 01:32:43.807
This guy ever run out of tricks?

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:49.521
No!

01:32:56.738 --> 01:32:58.239
Mother! No!

01:33:01.076 --> 01:33:02.368
Mother!

01:33:07.290 --> 01:33:09.583
Mother! Mother!

01:33:19.886 --> 01:33:21.887
Pierce through his heart.

01:33:24.724 --> 01:33:29.228
You must live and fight on.

01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:51.208
She said through the heart.

01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:53.836
Through the heart. Let's go.

01:34:07.726 --> 01:34:08.809
Get in!

01:34:09.686 --> 01:34:12.396
The O'Connells are going to
stop the Emperor!

01:34:24.034 --> 01:34:26.452
So, Dad, what's the plan?

01:34:26.536 --> 01:34:28.037
Divide and conquer!

01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:31.206
No offense,
but isn't that a little short on detail?

01:34:31.916 --> 01:34:34.418
- Twelve o'clock low!
- Hang on!

01:34:42.677 --> 01:34:44.094
Remember our deal!

01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:46.805
When this is over,
my men get to drink for free!

01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:49.808
You can have the whole damn bar
for all l care!

01:34:49.893 --> 01:34:52.603
I’m getting the hell out of China.

01:35:24.427 --> 01:35:26.887
l dug you up...

01:35:27.806 --> 01:35:30.265
and I’m gonna put you down.

01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:04.341
Alex? Alex!

01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:05.402
Let go!

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:06.570
Never!

01:37:10.492 --> 01:37:13.452
Enough tricks! Where's your honor?

01:37:16.581 --> 01:37:18.290
Fight like a man!

01:37:57.038 --> 01:37:58.705
Divide

01:38:00.291 --> 01:38:01.750
and conquer.

01:38:48.423 --> 01:38:51.258
Now you can rule in hell.

01:39:17.619 --> 01:39:19.369
The Emperor is dead.

01:39:19.662 --> 01:39:21.330
The Emperor is dead!

01:40:08.252 --> 01:40:12.381
- Evening, girls. You're looking well.
- Good evening, Mr. Maguire.

01:40:13.257 --> 01:40:17.052
- It’s a fine night to be me.
- You dance great for an old lady.

01:40:17.595 --> 01:40:20.138
Someone told me to stop living
on the sidelines.

01:40:20.223 --> 01:40:23.266
- Well, he sounds like a smart guy.
- He is.

01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:38.782
So l guess Dash and Scarlet
have their next adventure?

01:40:38.866 --> 01:40:41.743
Why write about it when you can live it?

01:40:42.870 --> 01:40:47.082
There's something incredibly romantic
about vanquishing the undead.

01:40:47.917 --> 01:40:50.502
Even more romantic doing it with you.

01:40:51.295 --> 01:40:54.131
- Kiss me.
- Don't have to ask me twice.

01:41:03.266 --> 01:41:04.933
- Can l get your bag, sir?
- No, no, no.

01:41:05.017 --> 01:41:07.018
Don't touch it, don't touch it.

01:41:07.103 --> 01:41:08.145
Where are you off to, Mr. Carnahan?

01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:10.605
Someplace where they don't have mummies.

01:41:10.690 --> 01:41:13.525
- Step on it! I’ve got a plane to catch.
- Yes, sir.

01:41:13.609 --> 01:41:17.279
Yeah. Ciao, ciao, Shanghai.

01:41:17.363 --> 01:41:19.531
Peru, here l come.

01:41:22.535 --> 01:41:26.997
Soon after, mummies were found in Peru.
