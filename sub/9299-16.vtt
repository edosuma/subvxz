00:18.527 --> 00:20.795
Excuse me. It's heavy traffic
in the Callahan tunnel.

00:20.829 --> 00:22.096
Can you take Northern Ave.?

01:12.614 --> 01:14.949
Why are we stopping?

01:24.993 --> 01:26.961
Please track this GPS signal.

01:29.164 --> 01:31.766
Track it. Track it to
where I am right now.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.636
No!

01:52.753 --> 01:55.656
Tommy, we're all so proud of you.

01:55.690 --> 01:58.058
You're on your way to
bringing back Rizzoli and sons.

01:58.093 --> 02:00.661
Yeah, little brother, you're
finally getting it together.

02:00.695 --> 02:04.131
Hey. I told you guys not to worry.
I'm a late bloomer.

02:04.166 --> 02:08.369
We all wish you and
Lydia a long and happy life.

02:08.402 --> 02:11.939
And thank you for finally
giving Ma what she wants.

02:11.973 --> 02:14.775
Mm. Yeah! At least one of my
kids are gonna get married!

02:14.810 --> 02:17.812
Oh.

02:17.846 --> 02:23.684
Oh. Thank you all.
I've felt alone for so long.

02:23.718 --> 02:27.922
Well, now T.J. and I ...
we have you.

02:27.956 --> 02:31.025
- And we're so lucky.
- Okay, good, now you can get busy

02:31.059 --> 02:32.459
and make me more grandchildren.

02:32.494 --> 02:34.495
<i>No. Ma! Come on.</i>

02:36.464 --> 02:38.933
Hey, uh, can you, uh,

02:39.000 --> 02:41.068
give me another bottle of
sparkling cider, please?

02:41.102 --> 02:42.571
Thanks.

02:44.940 --> 02:46.941
I'm so relieved that
Tommy didn't fall apart

02:46.975 --> 02:51.545
when Pop stressed us
all out with his visit.

02:51.613 --> 02:53.158
You're gonna lose that.

02:53.255 --> 02:56.784
So you better wear it or put
it back in the safe-deposit box.

02:56.818 --> 03:00.155
I guess I should tell
Casey before I tell you, but...

03:00.190 --> 03:03.557
I'm doing it, Maura.

03:03.592 --> 03:06.594
- Is Casey leaving the army?
- Yeah.

03:06.628 --> 03:09.830
<i>Oh, come here.
I'm so happy for you.</i>

03:10.899 --> 03:13.934
I've always wanted
to buy a triple decker

03:13.969 --> 03:15.836
down by the water and
fix it up, you know?

03:15.904 --> 03:18.706
- And have 2.5 kids.
- Yeah.

03:18.740 --> 03:21.075
Please, don't turn into my Mother.

03:22.777 --> 03:25.846
No, it's ... we haven't
even talked about it.

03:25.881 --> 03:27.848
Plus, you know what ...
there are plenty of couples

03:27.883 --> 03:30.985
who choose to remain childless.

03:31.019 --> 03:33.120
Yeah. I want to plan
your engagement shower.

03:33.154 --> 03:35.222
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

03:35.290 --> 03:38.125
But Mom loves planning.

03:38.159 --> 03:40.127
Yeah.

03:40.161 --> 03:43.464
What? You don't like
plastic champagne glasses?

03:43.531 --> 03:46.200
Well, you should use flutes
so you don't let the carbonation escape.

03:46.268 --> 03:49.603
- It's sparkling cider, Maura.
- Well...

03:49.638 --> 03:50.871
Rizzoli.

03:50.906 --> 03:53.240
- Yeah.
- I got to pull you away.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.776
- I just got off, sir.
- I've got a situation.

03:55.810 --> 03:58.178
A V.I.P.'s been murdered.
And grab Frankie.

03:58.213 --> 04:01.115
'Cause with Detective Frost
on vacation, we're down a man.

04:01.149 --> 04:02.750
Yes, sir.

04:05.821 --> 04:07.822
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

04:07.856 --> 04:10.591
Only Sergeant Korsak
and Officer Jenkins?

04:10.625 --> 04:12.426
<i>This is somebody big.</i>

04:12.461 --> 04:13.661
What's going on?

04:13.695 --> 04:16.697
I was on patrol taking an access road,
and I recognized her.

04:16.732 --> 04:18.466
We're lucky it was you.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.934
He called me instead of
putting it out on the radio.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.436
- Who is she?
- Natalie Bloomfield.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.472
- Wait. Senator Bloomfield's daughter?
- Yeah.

04:24.506 --> 04:25.840
I got to call the police commissioner.

04:25.907 --> 04:27.942
Jenkins, make sure nobody comes through.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.009
Yes, sir.

04:30.479 --> 04:34.148
- Who has to tell the senator?
- That's above our pay grade.

04:48.729 --> 04:51.800
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

04:52.591 --> 04:55.369
<b>4x16 - You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone</b>

04:58.973 --> 05:02.042
<i>Looks like a double
tap to the back of the head.</i>

05:04.946 --> 05:09.583
- Small caliber fid at close range.
- .22, maybe. Execution-style.

05:09.618 --> 05:11.452
What?
You think we're looking at a hit?

05:12.954 --> 05:16.590
- What, Maura? What is it?
- Her tongue was cut out.

05:17.637 --> 05:18.799
<i>Come on...</i>

05:18.827 --> 05:21.896
Man, you don't do that
unless you're making a point.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.564
Was she a rat?

05:27.769 --> 05:29.970
Wait. Wait.
Maura, what is that?

05:30.005 --> 05:32.506
Move her sleeve.
What is that? A tattoo?

05:34.643 --> 05:37.812
Well, that's odd.
It looks like a Q.R. code.

05:37.846 --> 05:40.714
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?

05:40.749 --> 05:45.119
- I'm trying to open it with an app.
- It's a tattoo.

05:45.153 --> 05:46.987
Oh, it looks similar
to a matrix bar code,

05:47.055 --> 05:49.824
which can be read by an imaging device.

05:49.858 --> 05:52.092
Nope. It's not opening.

05:53.762 --> 05:58.866
Got a bag of toiletries,
clean shirt, underwear.

05:58.934 --> 06:00.768
Frankie, we're close to the airport.

06:00.802 --> 06:02.770
Can you check and see if she's
booked on any flights tonight?

06:07.809 --> 06:10.878
- Retainers. How old was she?
- 25.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.515
All right. The Governor
notified Senator Bloomfield.

06:14.549 --> 06:16.951
Air force jet's bringing
her back from D.C.

06:16.985 --> 06:19.954
- We should go to her house.
- Yeah, the last thing we need

06:19.988 --> 06:22.122
is the media reporting
that the senator is in BPD.

06:22.157 --> 06:24.091
Dr. Isles, I'd like you to go with them.

06:24.159 --> 06:25.759
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

06:27.162 --> 06:29.864
Natalie was booked on
four flights tonight.

06:29.898 --> 06:31.732
Going to D.C., Hong Kong, Beijing,

06:31.766 --> 06:33.667
And Casablanca ... all one way.

06:33.702 --> 06:35.536
Why would she be booked
on four different flights?

06:35.570 --> 06:38.672
- Throw somebody off.
- Oh, she was engaged.

06:38.707 --> 06:42.710
I just found the announcement.
Waiman Zhang.

06:42.744 --> 06:46.881
- American citizen born in Beijing.
- Put a bolo out on him.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.684
Uh, Waiman and Natalie both worked

06:50.719 --> 06:53.821
at the Knowledge Aggregators Group.

06:53.855 --> 06:57.091
- What kind of company is that?
- Intelligence gatherers.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.093
- Are you guessing?
- No.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.829
"Knowledge" means intelligence,
and aggregators are gatherers.

07:01.863 --> 07:06.567
<i>K.A.G. is a contractor for the NSA.</i>

07:06.601 --> 07:10.638
National Security Agency?
What did Natalie do for them?

07:13.108 --> 07:16.844
- She was a computer engineer.
- Passport's here. And this.

07:16.878 --> 07:22.216
- Got to be 20 grand.
- Natalie was on the run.

07:22.284 --> 07:24.251
Yeah, well, why would
a killer leave that?

07:28.056 --> 07:31.225
'Cause something was here
that's more important than that cash.

07:31.293 --> 07:33.861
Empty laptop bags.
He was after her computers.

07:48.688 --> 07:51.924
Chief Deputy Clay Stephens,
Department of homeland security.

07:51.958 --> 07:55.628
- Sergeant-Detective Korsak.
- Detective Jane Rizzoli.

07:55.662 --> 07:58.731
- Dr. Isles, chief medical examiner.
- It's nice to meet you.

07:58.765 --> 08:01.967
Does homeland security
have an interest in this?

08:02.002 --> 08:03.302
Senator Bloomfield is a personal friend.

08:03.336 --> 08:06.739
And we work closely
on intelligence issues.

08:06.773 --> 08:09.909
- So you're here unofficially.
- Valerie is a grieving mother,

08:09.943 --> 08:12.278
and we want to take as much
off her plate as we can.

08:12.312 --> 08:14.346
"We" as in homeland security?

08:14.414 --> 08:18.851
- This is a very sensitive investigation.
- We all understand that.

08:18.885 --> 08:21.020
Then you understand that politics
play a role in everything.

08:21.054 --> 08:23.255
There's no place for politics
or a jurisdictional tug-of-war

08:23.290 --> 08:26.942
- in a murder investigation.
- We're not big-footing this.

08:26.943 --> 08:31.130
- We're here to offer assistance.
- I'm unclear how.

08:31.164 --> 08:33.131
'Cause homeland security
doesn't investigate murders.

08:33.166 --> 08:36.402
We have resources that
you cannot imagine.

08:38.337 --> 08:39.337
Did you find the boyfriend?

08:39.371 --> 08:42.041
- No, did you?
- No, but we will.

08:42.075 --> 08:45.210
How about we keep you in the loop,
and we'll give you access when we can?

08:47.781 --> 08:50.783
I've worked, uh, with federal
agencies multiple times.

08:50.817 --> 08:52.851
We're all prepared to cooperate.

08:52.886 --> 08:56.722
Then I'd like for you to wait
until tomorrow to begin the autopsy.

08:56.756 --> 08:58.324
May I ask why?

08:58.358 --> 09:00.025
The senator has requested
that a medical examiner

09:00.093 --> 09:01.794
who's a personal friend assist.

09:01.828 --> 09:04.964
- He's flying in from California.
- I understand.

09:05.031 --> 09:09.134
I'd like to process the clothing
and any other evidence tonight, though.

09:10.780 --> 09:14.940
- I'll take you to see the senator now.
- Thank you.

09:18.478 --> 09:22.448
The tailor was coming tomorrow
to take in Natalie's dress.

09:22.482 --> 09:25.184
She lost 15 pounds
over the last two weeks.

09:25.218 --> 09:28.454
Was your daughter under
any other kinds of stress?

09:28.488 --> 09:30.089
I mean, besides a wedding.

09:30.123 --> 09:34.093
My daughter was an
introvert ... very private.

09:34.127 --> 09:36.795
She didn't say it, but...

09:36.863 --> 09:39.965
yeah, I think she may have
been having wedding jitters.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.902
Uh, what can you tell us about
her fiancé, Waiman Zhang?

09:43.970 --> 09:46.438
I don't know him well.

09:46.473 --> 09:50.943
But my daughter loved him.

09:50.977 --> 09:53.946
You don't think he had anything
to do with this, do you?

09:54.014 --> 09:56.248
- Do you know where he is right now?
- No.

09:56.282 --> 09:59.718
Senator, our only chance of
solving your daughter's murder

09:59.753 --> 10:02.855
is if you are as forthcoming
with us as possible.

10:07.827 --> 10:10.829
There were partisan attacks on me

10:10.864 --> 10:13.966
<i>when my daughter
announced her engagement.</i>

10:14.000 --> 10:17.970
It was very hard on Natalie.

10:18.004 --> 10:22.241
She didn't want me to
respond, but I had to.

10:22.275 --> 10:23.377
What do you mean?

10:23.458 --> 10:25.878
Because her fiancé is
a naturalized citizen,

10:25.912 --> 10:28.080
there were suggestions
that he couldn't be trusted.

10:28.114 --> 10:29.481
What did you think?

10:29.516 --> 10:32.484
If our government had
any doubts about Waiman,

10:32.519 --> 10:34.086
he wouldn't have been issued

10:34.120 --> 10:36.121
a top-secret security
clearance at K.A.G.

10:36.156 --> 10:38.490
What did Natalie and
Waiman do for K.A.G.?

10:38.525 --> 10:40.025
I couldn't tell you.

10:41.194 --> 10:43.762
Their work fell under
the national security act.

10:43.797 --> 10:46.899
It seems strange you wouldn't know,
given your position in the Senate.

10:46.933 --> 10:50.035
The underlying tenet, particularly now,

10:50.070 --> 10:52.905
with recent leaks, is need-to-know.

10:52.939 --> 10:55.741
I didn't.
You could ask Christopher, though.

10:55.742 --> 10:59.311
Christopher Carnahan.
He's the C.E.O. of K.A.G.?

10:59.345 --> 11:00.979
- Yes.
- Okay.

11:01.014 --> 11:03.182
He and my late husband
were close friends.

11:03.216 --> 11:05.551
<i>He recruited Natalie to work with him.</i>

11:05.585 --> 11:09.088
Senator, when was the last
time you heard from Natalie?

11:12.892 --> 11:14.393
<i>Just...</i>

11:15.829 --> 11:19.064
"Mom, catching plane."
Where was she going?

11:19.099 --> 11:21.500
She frequently went
to D.C. for her work.

11:21.534 --> 11:25.471
Senator, we found 22 grand in
cash in Natalie's belongings.

11:25.505 --> 11:27.473
That's not possible. She
didn't have that kind of money.

11:27.507 --> 11:29.875
She was also booked
on four flights ...

11:29.909 --> 11:33.378
one to D.C., one to
Bangkok, one to Hong Kong,

11:33.413 --> 11:36.215
and one to Casablanca,
all leaving tonight.

11:36.249 --> 11:38.450
I don't understand why.

11:38.485 --> 11:41.353
We believe that your daughter
was possibly fleeing the country.

11:41.387 --> 11:42.763
No.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.892
We'll need to
process everything here.

11:46.926 --> 11:49.194
W-we're not logging it in?

11:49.229 --> 11:52.464
This is a very sensitive
investigation, Susie.

11:52.499 --> 11:54.933
Once it's logged in,
anyone has access to it.

11:54.968 --> 11:58.904
You don't think the NSA
is watching us now, right?

11:58.938 --> 12:01.507
Hmm. I wonder.

12:01.541 --> 12:05.844
- Well, privacy is an illusion, Susie.
- What do you mean?

12:05.879 --> 12:07.846
Well, your telephone
and internet records

12:07.881 --> 12:09.481
are all on file with the NSA.

12:09.516 --> 12:12.217
- Are you ... are you sure?
- Mine, too.

12:12.252 --> 12:15.387
Well, satellites,
drones, security cameras,

12:15.421 --> 12:18.891
license-plate cameras,
fast-pass lanes.

12:18.925 --> 12:21.560
Yes, privacy is a thing of the past.

12:24.698 --> 12:26.398
Jane's not back yet?

12:26.466 --> 12:29.234
She's still with the
senator. Can I help?

12:29.269 --> 12:33.105
Nah, it's Tommy.
I need Jane. He won't listen to me.

12:33.139 --> 12:35.974
- Frankie, what is it?
- He's in trouble.

12:44.450 --> 12:46.518
He's drinking, Frankie.

12:46.586 --> 12:48.253
No, he's hammered, Maura.

12:51.057 --> 12:53.125
What happened after
the engagement party?

12:53.193 --> 12:55.427
Oh, he wouldn't talk to me.

12:55.461 --> 12:58.297
A friend saw him in here and called me.

13:03.136 --> 13:05.270
Ahh! That was good.

13:05.305 --> 13:08.540
Hey, Maura!
Want a boilermaker?

13:08.575 --> 13:10.976
- No, thank you.
- Oh, that's too bad.

13:11.010 --> 13:12.277
I haven't had one of
these in three years.

13:12.345 --> 13:14.646
- What about you, Francis?
- Let me take you home.

13:14.681 --> 13:16.615
Is it bedtime for Francis?

13:16.649 --> 13:18.984
- Can I sit down?
- You got to drink!

13:20.687 --> 13:24.122
- You seem really sad.
- No, I'm happy.

13:24.157 --> 13:25.924
Can you tell me what made you so upset?

13:25.959 --> 13:28.894
You know what, Frankie...
you should buy her

13:28.928 --> 13:31.296
a nice glass of '96 Chateau Lafite.

13:31.364 --> 13:33.065
You still won't have a chance,

13:33.099 --> 13:35.434
but at least you'll impress
her if you know your wines.

13:35.468 --> 13:37.069
Shut your mouth.
Let's go.

13:37.103 --> 13:38.370
Do you think Maura's gonna go for you?

13:38.404 --> 13:40.339
She's high-class.
You're blue-collar...

13:40.373 --> 13:42.341
- Come on. Let's go.
- Oh, you gonna make me?!

13:42.375 --> 13:43.567
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:43.686 --> 13:45.514
- No, no, no.
- I'm gonna make you, you little punk.

13:45.549 --> 13:46.612
- Yeah?
- Frankie, wait. Stop. Stop, stop. Wait.

13:46.646 --> 13:50.182
- Maura, I got it!
- Just wait. Just wait.

13:50.216 --> 13:53.585
<i>No, Tommy! Don't! Tommy!</i>

13:56.689 --> 13:58.123
<i>No!</i>

13:59.058 --> 14:02.494
- Frankie, stop him!
- Relax.

14:02.528 --> 14:03.595
- Get off me!
- Tommy! Tommy.

14:03.630 --> 14:06.632
- Get off me!
- Relax. Relax.

14:10.003 --> 14:12.604
- Want half? It's tuna.
- No, thank you.

14:12.672 --> 14:14.072
It's been refrigerated.

14:14.140 --> 14:16.642
No, it's just my
stomach's been bad all day.

14:18.244 --> 14:20.345
<i>There's nothing on the boyfriend.</i>

14:20.380 --> 14:22.080
I got officers staked
out at his apartment.

14:24.117 --> 14:27.419
- You wearing a ring?
- And you call yourself a detective.

14:27.487 --> 14:30.489
Yeah, had it on all night.

14:30.523 --> 14:34.259
- So when do we start calling you Mrs.?
- As soon as Casey gets home.

14:34.294 --> 14:37.195
Retiring after 20 years in the army?
Within reach of making general?

14:37.230 --> 14:40.632
- He must really love you.
- Nah, he just misses Boston.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.234
Yeah.

14:42.302 --> 14:45.738
Okay, so, Natalie was murdered
trying to flee to one of three

14:45.739 --> 14:49.174
places that do not have
extradition treaties with the U.S.

14:49.242 --> 14:52.210
What's your feeling on the senator?
Any chance she's behind this?

14:52.245 --> 14:54.079
Pretty cold to kill your kid,

14:54.113 --> 14:56.248
even if she was about
to leak top-secret intel.

14:56.282 --> 14:59.651
Well, unless your kid's
a female Edward Snowden.

14:59.686 --> 15:03.455
I don't care how powerful she is.
If she did it, we're gonna get her.

15:03.523 --> 15:05.390
Did we check if the
boyfriend hopped on a plane?

15:05.425 --> 15:07.626
Oh, yeah. He didn't.
Unless he had a fake passport.

15:07.694 --> 15:10.429
- We put him on a watch list.
- Can't hide forever.

15:11.764 --> 15:13.265
<i>We got Natalie
Bloomfield's phone records.</i>

15:13.299 --> 15:15.133
She really was an introvert.

15:15.201 --> 15:18.303
Only one or two calls a
day for the past two weeks.

15:18.338 --> 15:20.172
What about before that?

15:21.307 --> 15:24.543
Huh.
Good thought, Jane. A lot more.

15:24.577 --> 15:29.014
She changed her habits.
She was using a burn phone.

15:29.082 --> 15:30.782
Well, Natalie must have thought
she was under surveillance.

15:30.817 --> 15:32.684
Makes sense if she was
about to leak intelligence.

15:32.752 --> 15:36.455
We're gonna need warrants
for Natalie's apartment and office.

15:36.489 --> 15:38.156
Yeah, I know.

15:38.224 --> 15:39.524
I'm just trying to decide
whether I'm better off

15:39.559 --> 15:41.760
waking up Judge Walters
or Judge Steinberg.

15:41.794 --> 15:43.628
Go with Steinberg.

15:43.696 --> 15:46.365
Any press reporting this yet?

15:46.432 --> 15:48.667
No. Senator's office
hasn't released anything.

15:48.701 --> 15:52.838
Hey, Maura.
I'm at work.

15:52.872 --> 15:54.406
Okay. Yeah, no, no.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.841
It's ... it's fi...
I'll be right there.

15:55.875 --> 15:58.276
Okay. Okay.

15:58.344 --> 16:00.579
- Everything okay?
- I'm not sure.

16:00.613 --> 16:03.315
Then go find out. We can
pick this up in the morning.

16:03.349 --> 16:05.317
Thanks, boss.

16:05.351 --> 16:07.686
Frankie, you really should have
a plastic surgeon look at this.

16:07.720 --> 16:09.287
It's a lip.
Just stitch it up.

16:09.322 --> 16:12.290
Wipe your nose.
Put this on your eye.

16:12.325 --> 16:14.292
- I don't have any lidocaine.
- I was a hockey player.

16:14.327 --> 16:16.228
It only hurts when it's
a compound fracture.

16:16.262 --> 16:19.598
- Just do it fast.
- This must be very painful.

16:19.632 --> 16:21.433
Mm-hmm.

16:21.467 --> 16:23.268
I don't want the ice, Ma.

16:23.302 --> 16:25.604
- You're amazing.
- He's a dick.

16:25.638 --> 16:26.872
Watch your language!

16:26.906 --> 16:29.341
- What happened?
- Ask him.

16:29.409 --> 16:33.111
- Shut up. Don't talk to me.
- Don't talk to your brother like that!

16:33.146 --> 16:34.546
I just rushed here in
the middle of a huge case.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.081
Somebody better tell me
what the hell's going on.

16:36.115 --> 16:38.350
- Tommy was drinking.
- Oh. Thanks a lot, Maura.

16:38.384 --> 16:39.885
He was shit-faced.

16:39.919 --> 16:44.222
- Tommy. Why?
- 'Cause I felt like it.

16:44.257 --> 16:46.691
You've been sober for three years, okay?

16:46.759 --> 16:51.396
- What happened?
- Lydia left me.

16:51.431 --> 16:53.765
Oh, my god.
I knew she was no good.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.501
I'm the one who's no good, Ma.

16:57.503 --> 17:03.241
Tommy... talk.

17:03.276 --> 17:07.546
You started drinking again.
That's why Lydia left you, isn't it?

17:08.614 --> 17:11.316
- Is it?
- Yeah.

17:11.349 --> 17:15.487
Oh, my god. Just as
everything was going good?

17:15.521 --> 17:16.855
Why did you drink?

17:16.923 --> 17:20.826
Pop's cancer scare just
knocked me on my ass.

17:20.859 --> 17:22.461
I fell off the wagon.

17:22.494 --> 17:24.429
Lydia said she didn't
want to live with a drunk.

17:24.464 --> 17:26.162
Where's Lydia?

17:26.858 --> 17:31.555
- Tommy... where did she take T.J.?
- I don't know!

17:41.467 --> 17:45.404
Well, it's not Boston joe's,
but it's drinkable, Jane.

17:46.806 --> 17:51.176
Well, it's hard to tell, but I
found evidence of recent hair loss.

17:51.210 --> 17:54.012
How recent?
Natalie's mother said that she dropped

17:54.080 --> 17:55.614
a bunch of weight in
the last couple of weeks.

17:55.648 --> 17:57.249
Within that time frame.

17:57.283 --> 18:00.586
She showed additional signs of
potential stress, including bruxism.

18:00.653 --> 18:03.488
I know what that is
because I ground my teeth

18:03.523 --> 18:06.525
for at least three hours last night.

18:06.559 --> 18:09.361
- I couldn't sleep, either.
- And it's not just my idiot brother

18:09.429 --> 18:12.064
and my missing nephew
and this poor dead girl

18:12.098 --> 18:14.199
that kept me awake.

18:14.233 --> 18:16.735
Don't think about planning
a wedding now, Jane.

18:18.338 --> 18:19.705
<i>No, it's not that.</i>

18:19.739 --> 18:21.540
<i>We're gonna do it at
the justice of the peace.</i>

18:21.574 --> 18:22.808
I just keep worrying that
something's gonna happen

18:22.842 --> 18:25.751
to him in the last weeks
as he's in Afghanistan, you know?

18:25.786 --> 18:27.220
Don't think negative thoughts.

18:27.255 --> 18:30.357
Your body will experience something
that isn't even happening.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.349
Yeah.

18:35.763 --> 18:39.266
- Damn it.
- What's the matter?

18:39.300 --> 18:41.401
The judge denied the
warrant for Natalie's office.

18:41.435 --> 18:43.603
Korsak thinks the Feds intervened.

18:43.638 --> 18:47.140
"Still waiting to see if the judge will
sign the warrant for her apartment."

18:47.175 --> 18:50.577
- Hi.
- Hi. It's out.

18:51.712 --> 18:54.447
All the national news crews are in town.

18:54.482 --> 18:57.417
- How much do they know?
- No details on the shooting yet,

18:57.485 --> 18:58.618
but they're digging
into Natalie and Waiman's

18:58.653 --> 19:00.520
top-secret security clearances.

19:00.588 --> 19:02.522
It's only a matter of time
before they start to speculate

19:02.557 --> 19:05.058
that Natalie was killed to
keep her from leaking secrets.

19:05.092 --> 19:07.360
- Hmm.
- How's your lip?

19:07.395 --> 19:10.463
Good.
I had a great plastic surgeon.

19:11.199 --> 19:14.201
- You want some coffee?
- Love some.

19:14.235 --> 19:16.069
Good. Stay have a cup.

19:16.137 --> 19:18.271
Tommy still in your apartment?

19:18.339 --> 19:20.774
Think so. The bars
don't open till 11:00.

19:20.808 --> 19:24.377
- Not funny.
- Well...

19:24.412 --> 19:25.745
I would like to take a look
at your lip, if you don't mind,

19:25.813 --> 19:27.747
to make sure that there
are no signs of infection.

19:27.782 --> 19:29.718
- Oh.
- Okay?

19:29.799 --> 19:32.395
- Oh, it looks good.
- Yeah?

19:32.411 --> 19:34.710
- No swelling, no regnus. {*corr}
- Mhm.

19:34.745 --> 19:37.222
- Does that hurt?
- No.

19:37.256 --> 19:38.723
Hmm. You sure?

19:42.361 --> 19:46.364
- Uh...
- Forgot my keys.

19:46.399 --> 19:49.401
Actually, I don't have time
for coffee. See you at work.

19:54.874 --> 19:58.410
Okay, what's going on between you two?

19:58.444 --> 20:02.247
He is a ... a very kind
and a very good person.

20:02.281 --> 20:04.115
Mm-hmm?

20:04.150 --> 20:06.117
Well, since you and I don't have time

20:06.152 --> 20:09.521
for a touchy-feely download,
can you just tell me,

20:09.555 --> 20:13.391
are you planning to
see my brother naked?

20:13.426 --> 20:17.462
Jane, I don't want to talk about
this with you right now.

20:17.497 --> 20:20.198
You may not know
this, but that one ...

20:20.233 --> 20:22.598
when he falls, he falls hard.

20:23.669 --> 20:26.393
So you can't mess with his heart, okay?

20:29.675 --> 20:32.178
<i>Uh, I don't think our
badges are gonna do too well here.</i>

20:32.213 --> 20:34.179
<i>I can talk my way in anywhere.</i>

20:34.213 --> 20:36.815
Well, then, you do the
talking, James Bond.

20:36.849 --> 20:38.283
Do you know how
many private security companies

20:38.317 --> 20:40.151
work for the NSA?

20:40.219 --> 20:42.454
- About 2,000.
- Bet you don't know this ...

20:42.488 --> 20:44.289
there are half a million
non-government workers

20:44.323 --> 20:45.824
with top-secret security clearance.

20:45.892 --> 20:47.592
Like Natalie Bloomfield.

20:47.627 --> 20:48.894
Do you know how many government agencies

20:48.928 --> 20:52.297
there are conducting
intelligence activities?

20:52.331 --> 20:56.968
- 16.
- We got the C.I.A., D.I.A., NSA,

20:56.969 --> 20:59.704
NGA, NRO, Afisra,
Inscom, MCIA, O.N.I,

20:59.772 --> 21:06.344
O.I.C.I., INR, CGI, FBI,
D.E.A./O.N.S.I., INR, and TFI.

21:06.379 --> 21:09.481
That's very impressive.
Now breathe.

21:11.384 --> 21:13.184
Ah, I think they would
have killed Snowden

21:13.219 --> 21:14.819
if they'd been able to catch him.

21:14.854 --> 21:17.422
I think you've been
watching too many movies.

21:17.490 --> 21:19.324
<i>Yeah, me, too.</i>

21:19.358 --> 21:21.960
And, Frankie, Feds
don't cut out tongues.

21:21.994 --> 21:23.962
Yeah, what about as a warning
to other hackers and leakers?

21:23.996 --> 21:25.530
<i>I don't think so.</i>

21:25.565 --> 21:27.465
But, you know, private
intelligent companies

21:27.500 --> 21:30.735
are stacked with ex-C.I.A.
and special-ops guys.

21:30.770 --> 21:33.705
- The hit was slick.
- Phew!

21:34.974 --> 21:37.876
Sorry, Sergeant Korsak,
I'm gonna have to turn you around.

21:37.910 --> 21:40.645
- Hey, you know my name!
- Back up the line!

21:40.713 --> 21:42.647
Could you let Christopher
Carnahan know we're here?

21:42.715 --> 21:44.249
This one's turning around.

21:44.283 --> 21:50.622
- Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.
- I don't think he's listening to you.

21:50.656 --> 21:55.026
Oh, well, homeland security
didn't have any trouble getting in.

21:55.061 --> 21:56.861
<i>I thought you agreed
to keep us in the loop.</i>

21:56.896 --> 21:59.798
It looks like you don't need
any help staying in the loops.

21:59.832 --> 22:03.568
And in order for us to share,
we have to investigate.

22:03.603 --> 22:05.670
We need to get into Natalie's office.

22:05.705 --> 22:08.506
- You don't have a warrant to search it.
- Thanks to you.

22:10.610 --> 22:13.511
We just need to speak
to Natalie's boss, okay?

22:14.714 --> 22:17.327
Look ... you're the one that said
you were friends with her mother.

22:17.435 --> 22:19.600
If that's true, then
help us find her killer.

22:23.990 --> 22:27.692
- Christopher, it's good to see you.
- You, too, clay. What a tragedy.

22:27.727 --> 22:30.829
- How's Valerie?
- Not good.

22:30.863 --> 22:35.400
These are detectives
investigating Natalie's murder?

22:35.434 --> 22:37.636
Christopher Carnahan, C.E.O.,
Knowledge Aggregators Group.

22:37.670 --> 22:39.638
how can I help you?

22:39.672 --> 22:40.905
You can tell us what
Natalie was working on.

22:40.940 --> 22:42.540
Natalie was a key member

22:42.575 --> 22:45.810
of our cryptography and
computer-security section.

22:45.845 --> 22:47.479
It's important that we
know what she was doing

22:47.513 --> 22:48.847
in the hours leading up to her death.

22:48.914 --> 22:52.550
- Anything you can tell us might help.
- Nothing out of the routine.

22:52.585 --> 22:54.853
You know where she was going last night?

22:54.920 --> 22:56.655
Yeah, she left here about 7:00 P.M.

22:56.689 --> 23:00.291
She went to Logan to fly to D.C.
for a morning security briefing.

23:00.326 --> 23:03.762
- How did she get there?
- Our internal car service.

23:03.796 --> 23:05.997
Can you check your records and
find out who drove her there?

23:06.032 --> 23:08.532
I can check right here.

23:09.468 --> 23:13.438
Well, this is strange.
She canceled the car.

23:13.472 --> 23:15.840
We think it's possible
Natalie may have been

23:15.875 --> 23:19.844
- about to leak some intelligence.
- I can't believe that. Not Natalie.

23:19.879 --> 23:22.242
- What evidence do you have of that?
- She booked one-way flights

23:22.327 --> 23:24.749
to countries without
extradition treaties,

23:24.784 --> 23:28.753
and we believe she took two
laptops with her from K.A.G.

23:28.788 --> 23:31.856
- We'll do a full internal audit.
- This game just changed.

23:31.891 --> 23:33.625
This is now a matter
of national security.

23:33.693 --> 23:36.461
The missing computers are
a matter of national security.

23:36.495 --> 23:40.911
- Natalie's homicide is still of concern to us.
- We'll see about that.

23:41.801 --> 23:45.370
They're gonna put up a wall
we won't be able to get around.

23:45.404 --> 23:47.806
What if one of those 16
government agencies killed Natalie?

23:47.840 --> 23:49.607
Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh...

23:49.642 --> 23:51.810
What? Security cameras
can't read my lips.

23:51.844 --> 23:53.044
We're running out of time.

23:54.447 --> 23:57.682
- Hey, Maura, start that autopsy.
- I can't, Jane.

23:57.717 --> 24:00.018
I'm still waiting for the medical
examiner that the senator sent.

24:00.052 --> 24:01.519
<i>Okay, the homeland security guy</i>

24:01.554 --> 24:04.389
just said that he would
like for you to wait.

24:04.423 --> 24:07.158
That's not an official-official.
That's a courtesy.

24:07.193 --> 24:08.860
I don't like where this
conversation is headed.

24:08.894 --> 24:12.464
Well, you're gonna like this even less.
You're about to lose that body.

24:12.498 --> 24:13.631
<i>- What? How do you know that?
- I'm a good guesser.</i>

24:13.699 --> 24:15.500
Jane, I can't cut her body.

24:15.568 --> 24:18.036
Well, you better do everything but
because it's all we've got.

24:30.759 --> 24:33.027
Come on. Come on.

24:33.095 --> 24:36.030
- How long has it been?
- 1 minute and 46 seconds.

24:37.766 --> 24:40.034
All right, close enough.

24:41.536 --> 24:44.105
We're here to take custody
of Natalie Bloomfield's body

24:44.139 --> 24:46.273
and any and all evidence
you've collected.

24:52.710 --> 24:55.645
I don't see any men in
black suits anywhere.

24:55.680 --> 24:58.548
Maybe we can find a way to
see into Natalie's apartment.

24:58.583 --> 24:59.423
We may not have to.

24:59.424 --> 25:01.785
- The judge just signed a warrant.
- Nice.

25:14.298 --> 25:16.433
What happened?

25:16.467 --> 25:20.136
Well, the Feds paid us a visit.

25:20.171 --> 25:24.007
Oh, well, I feel so much
more secure, don't you?

25:24.075 --> 25:27.577
They took my computer.
I had personal photos!

25:27.612 --> 25:30.647
They took everything,
even my handwritten notes.

25:30.681 --> 25:35.118
Hey, Vince. How would you
like Detective King's computer?

25:35.152 --> 25:36.620
That looks just like my computer.

25:36.687 --> 25:41.658
Yeah, well, I swapped his out
with yours, and they took his.

25:41.692 --> 25:44.260
You didn't happen to save mine, did you?

25:44.295 --> 25:47.225
Why don't you try this one?

25:48.299 --> 25:50.266
You know you can get in
a lot of trouble for this.

25:50.301 --> 25:52.135
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

25:52.169 --> 25:56.673
- Is there any news on this boyfriend?
- Nothing.

25:56.707 --> 25:58.308
But why don't we go over
what we know about Natalie?

25:58.342 --> 26:00.377
Right, she was, uh ...
she was stressed out.

26:00.444 --> 26:02.679
She was losing weight.
She wasn't using her cellphone.

26:02.713 --> 26:04.547
Korsak, do you still
have her phone records?

26:04.582 --> 26:07.117
- Yeah.
- Who did she call two weeks ago

26:07.151 --> 26:08.585
right before she
stopped using that phone?

26:08.619 --> 26:11.788
The office, boyfriend.

26:11.822 --> 26:14.391
Wait. What's this 800 number?

26:14.425 --> 26:18.762
Huh. Reservation desk of the
Logan convention center and hotel.

26:18.796 --> 26:20.730
Well, what was going on there?

26:20.765 --> 26:22.599
Three-day government
intelligence community conference.

26:22.633 --> 26:26.536
Looks like 1,500 private and government
intelligence experts attended.

26:26.604 --> 26:28.304
Check the cellphone
towers near that hotel.

26:28.339 --> 26:31.241
Maybe she stayed there.

26:31.275 --> 26:34.878
Yeah, she was within range
of their towers for all three days.

26:34.912 --> 26:36.846
Maybe something happened at
that hotel during the conference.

26:36.881 --> 26:41.451
Or maybe she met someone and
decided to leak or sell intelligence.

26:41.485 --> 26:45.655
Senator Bloomfield's
giving a press conference.

26:45.690 --> 26:47.524
<i>Some claim that my daughter was about</i>

26:47.558 --> 26:51.127
<i>to divulge sensitive
intelligence information.</i>

26:51.162 --> 26:52.495
Well, she got out in front of it.

26:52.530 --> 26:54.597
The media must have
been about to break it.

26:54.632 --> 26:57.434
<i>There could only be one explanation ...</i>

26:57.501 --> 27:01.504
<i>she was influenced by
her fiancé, Waiman Zhang.</i>

27:01.539 --> 27:05.241
Maybe she knows something we don't.

27:05.276 --> 27:10.513
Hey. Come on.
Maura says she's got something.

27:10.548 --> 27:14.350
- Susie, is anybody there?
- No, dr. Isles.

27:14.385 --> 27:18.588
All right, this is a dental
mold of Natalie's teeth.

27:18.622 --> 27:21.891
Mm, making a dental mold
is a federal offense.

27:21.926 --> 27:24.661
- What?!
- Susie, I told you I will take

27:24.729 --> 27:27.630
full responsibility
for obstructing justice.

27:27.665 --> 27:30.670
- What did you do?
- Uh, well, Susie, check again.

27:30.705 --> 27:32.469
No one's coming,
doctor, but please hurry.

27:32.503 --> 27:33.737
Yes, doctor, please.

27:33.771 --> 27:36.306
I can't stare at a
dental mold much longer.

27:37.340 --> 27:40.710
You palmed Natalie's retainers.

27:40.745 --> 27:43.847
Well, I, um ... they, um ... yes.

27:43.914 --> 27:47.317
- Okay, that actually is obstructing justice.
- Oh, boy.

27:48.385 --> 27:50.520
May I ask why?

27:50.554 --> 27:54.224
And why we're gathered here
staring at dental contraband?

27:54.258 --> 27:59.162
This is Natalie's maxillary upper
and her mandibular lower.

27:59.196 --> 28:01.498
She had active orthodontic
treatment as a teenager.

28:01.532 --> 28:02.866
Watch this.

28:03.934 --> 28:07.704
Doesn't fit.
Are you sure those are Natalie's?

28:07.738 --> 28:10.473
Yes.
Uh, her alignment has relapsed.

28:10.508 --> 28:12.308
So Natalie didn't wear them.

28:12.343 --> 28:14.444
How long had it been since she did?

28:14.478 --> 28:17.380
Years ... two to three, at least.

28:17.414 --> 28:19.249
But we found them with
her in her briefcase.

28:19.283 --> 28:21.451
Why would you take
retainers that don't fit?

28:21.485 --> 28:22.719
You wouldn't.

28:23.753 --> 28:26.756
She didn't pack them.
Somebody else did.

28:26.791 --> 28:28.792
Not the boyfriend.
He'd know she didn't wear them.

28:28.826 --> 28:29.893
Maura, this is great.

28:31.295 --> 28:32.796
Okay, we got to get
into Natalie's apartment.

28:32.830 --> 28:34.464
Why? What will that tell you?

28:34.532 --> 28:37.333
If somebody else packed her things,
that somebody was in the apartment.

28:37.368 --> 28:38.668
Mm-hmm, and if we're right,

28:38.736 --> 28:40.403
then Natalie wasn't
running, she was set up.

28:40.437 --> 28:43.706
- How do we get past the Feds?
- We're gonna need help.

28:45.776 --> 28:47.911
Senator, what we have
to tell you about your daughter

28:47.945 --> 28:49.479
is not something that you want

28:49.547 --> 28:52.348
the Department of
homeland security to hear.

28:52.383 --> 28:56.352
Well, if it's a question
of national security ...

28:56.387 --> 28:57.787
It isn't.
It's of a personal nature.

28:57.822 --> 29:02.174
Clay, can you give us a minute?

29:04.731 --> 29:07.596
We believe your daughter was framed.

29:07.631 --> 29:11.501
Natalie's retainers
were found with her body.

29:13.704 --> 29:18.041
- I was able to determine that she wasn't ...
- Yeah, no, I...

29:18.075 --> 29:21.911
Oh, god.

29:21.946 --> 29:25.281
And I blamed Waiman.

29:25.349 --> 29:28.718
We had a little joke.
I told her for college graduation,

29:28.752 --> 29:30.019
I was giving her braces again

29:30.054 --> 29:31.821
because she never wore
the damn retainers.

29:31.856 --> 29:35.792
I knew it. I knew she would
never betray her country.

29:35.826 --> 29:38.027
Then help us prove that.

29:39.430 --> 29:40.630
You can't do this, Valerie.

29:40.664 --> 29:43.533
I am a senior Senator of the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

29:43.567 --> 29:45.368
<i>This warrant was
issued by a state judge.</i>

29:45.402 --> 29:47.904
A federal judge can block it.

29:47.938 --> 29:50.973
Are you gonna tell them to move?

29:51.408 --> 29:52.609
Come on, senator.

29:53.577 --> 29:57.347
Unless you'd like to be on national news
arresting a U.S. Senator.

29:57.381 --> 29:59.849
And the chief medical examiner
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

29:59.917 --> 30:02.879
And three Boston homicide detectives.

30:03.821 --> 30:05.788
Excuse us.

30:26.888 --> 30:30.724
Oh... If I know Clay,
he's already working

30:30.759 --> 30:32.860
on a federal court order
to get us out of here.

30:32.894 --> 30:36.030
I'll see what I can do to slow him down.

30:37.064 --> 30:40.634
Let's hope the Feds missed something.

30:40.702 --> 30:43.904
See anything on the lock?

30:43.938 --> 30:45.906
Scratches on the tumbler.
It's been picked.

30:45.940 --> 30:49.043
Well, that doesn't sound very
high tech for government spooks.

30:49.110 --> 30:51.512
Google glasses still won't
let you pass through walls.

30:53.215 --> 30:57.218
- Interesting. She was a knitter.
- Maura, we brought you here

30:57.252 --> 31:00.120
because we couldn't
bring CSRU, remember?

31:00.155 --> 31:03.390
Oh. Found a needle in a pencil eraser

31:03.425 --> 31:07.728
with stained-black thread.
India ink.

31:09.431 --> 31:11.799
And a permanent marker.

31:11.833 --> 31:15.669
Ink? What?
Like making a tattoo?

31:15.704 --> 31:17.137
Hmm, these are all
supplies that could be used

31:17.172 --> 31:20.608
- to make a homemade tattoo.
- Natalie's wrist.

31:20.642 --> 31:23.811
The ink is consistent with the ink
that was used on her tattoo.

31:23.845 --> 31:27.147
- Frank, you took a picture of it, right?
- Yeah.

31:29.217 --> 31:31.719
I mean, why would Natalie
give herself a homemade tattoo?

31:31.753 --> 31:33.921
Well, it's a unique design?

31:35.790 --> 31:37.591
- Wow. That's weird.
- Hmm?

31:37.626 --> 31:40.261
I don't have any cell service in here.

31:40.295 --> 31:44.565
- Yeah. Me, either.
- And I don't have google.

31:44.599 --> 31:46.300
The kids these days
are calling it "wi-fi."

31:46.334 --> 31:49.537
Why would a computer-engineer
genius like Natalie

31:49.604 --> 31:51.672
live in a place without cell service?

31:51.706 --> 31:55.142
Yeah, and no 25-year-old I know
has an old-school phone.

31:55.176 --> 31:57.678
Old-school? It's cordless.

31:59.381 --> 32:00.681
You guys don't have those at home?

32:00.749 --> 32:03.584
No. Kids use these.

32:03.618 --> 32:06.358
You people think you're so funny.

32:07.660 --> 32:14.366
A 2.4 gigahertz signal
would override the router.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.369
Check to see if you have
cell service and wi-fi now.

32:17.437 --> 32:18.937
Yeah, it's back up.

32:22.275 --> 32:25.911
So Natalie made a
homemade wi-fi jammer.

32:25.945 --> 32:28.280
She was under surveillance.

32:28.314 --> 32:29.848
<i>And what do you do when
you're under surveillance?</i>

32:29.882 --> 32:33.752
- You don't use electronic devices.
- You go old-school.

32:33.786 --> 32:37.522
All right, so, what did the Feds miss?

32:37.557 --> 32:39.658
What's still here that could help us?

32:39.725 --> 32:41.993
"Pick up dry cleaning.
Get fruit.

32:42.028 --> 32:44.396
<i>Go to bank and deposit check."</i>

32:44.464 --> 32:46.398
Okay, even I direct-deposit.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.934
Yeah, so does she.
I checked her bank records.

32:48.968 --> 32:51.303
Why else would you go to the bank?

32:51.337 --> 32:53.738
Did you check to see if she was
paying for a safe-deposit box?

32:53.806 --> 32:54.973
Yeah, she wasn't.

32:55.007 --> 32:57.709
I'm such a good customer,
my gold card gives me one for free.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.511
Did she have a credit
card through her bank?

32:59.545 --> 33:00.846
Yeah.

33:00.913 --> 33:04.282
So maybe she had a
free safe-deposit box.

33:04.317 --> 33:06.651
No payment record. You
wouldn't be able to trace it.

33:06.686 --> 33:08.453
Exactly.

33:25.338 --> 33:30.008
- Two red NSA badges.
- The scarlet letter.

33:30.042 --> 33:31.510
Red means you're about to
lose your security clearance.

33:31.544 --> 33:33.578
So someone's threatening
Natalie and her fiancé.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.415
Yeah, her mother, too.
Look at this.

33:37.483 --> 33:40.285
<i>"Kick Bloomfield out of Washington."</i>

33:40.319 --> 33:43.755
Laundry bag from the Logan
convention center and hotel.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.358
Where Natalie spent
three days. What's that?

33:46.425 --> 33:49.861
Bloody wash rag.
Bodily fluid?

33:53.032 --> 33:55.700
It's definitely semen,
but it wasn't her fiancé's.

33:55.768 --> 33:57.302
It was a different blood type.

33:57.336 --> 33:59.471
The blood on the washcloth is A.B.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.673
A.B.?
So the blood is Natalie's?

34:01.707 --> 34:04.576
She was grinding her teeth,
losing her hair, not eating.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.011
What's that sound like to you?

34:06.045 --> 34:08.079
Add blood and semen,
sounds like she was raped.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.815
Yeah, the washcloth is from the
Logan convention center and hotel.

34:10.850 --> 34:12.751
I think she was raped there.

34:12.784 --> 34:16.321
If Natalie was raped at a security
conference, why not report it?

34:16.355 --> 34:18.790
A-and why save the washcloth?
Why not her clothing?

34:18.824 --> 34:21.059
Maybe he took her clothes and
made her shower in front of him.

34:21.092 --> 34:24.094
He was just as careful and efficient
at raping her as he was at killing her.

34:24.130 --> 34:26.898
Mm-hmm.

34:29.569 --> 34:32.370
Rizzoli.

34:32.405 --> 34:34.539
What? Where?

34:34.574 --> 34:37.108
Okay, thanks.

34:37.143 --> 34:39.578
Waiman Zhang just turned himself in.

34:39.645 --> 34:43.949
- The boyfriend? To the Feds?
- To us.

34:44.016 --> 34:46.117
Why did you disappear?

34:49.522 --> 34:53.592
- Natalie sent me this text.
- "Plan 'x'"?

34:53.626 --> 34:54.859
This is gonna sound
like something out of

34:54.893 --> 34:58.096
- "the Bourne identity."
- Try us.

34:58.130 --> 35:01.733
We were at a conference,
and something happened there.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.002
- The security conference at Logan center?
- Yeah.

35:04.036 --> 35:05.637
What were you doing there?

35:05.671 --> 35:09.140
All the K.A.G. people were there.
I was only there the first day.

35:09.175 --> 35:11.142
Natalie was there the whole weekend.

35:11.177 --> 35:13.878
And when I picked her
up, she was different.

35:13.913 --> 35:16.481
Different? How?

35:16.549 --> 35:19.517
She was really quiet,
but more than usual.

35:19.552 --> 35:22.787
- Yeah.
- She wouldn't talk to me.

35:22.822 --> 35:27.158
And she was just crying all the time.
And that wasn't like her.

35:27.193 --> 35:29.828
You were her fiancé.
You must have had some idea

35:29.829 --> 35:32.864
- of what was upsetting her.
- I tried to get it out of her,

35:32.898 --> 35:35.667
but she said that if I knew
that I would be at risk, too.

35:35.735 --> 35:37.669
Let's go back to "plan X."

35:37.703 --> 35:40.939
What we do for a living
would make anybody paranoid.

35:40.973 --> 35:42.140
Natalie thought that
we should have a plan

35:42.174 --> 35:44.976
just in case we needed to disappear.

35:45.011 --> 35:48.446
- Plan X.
- Yeah.

35:48.481 --> 35:51.516
Um, could we see your tattoo?

35:53.754 --> 35:57.756
Natalie did that.
She had one, too.

35:57.790 --> 35:59.024
Frankie.

35:59.058 --> 36:03.728
No, I tried. It doesn't open.

36:03.763 --> 36:06.898
I have another idea.

36:32.014 --> 36:35.283
- It's opening.
- It's an encrypted link to the deep web.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.886
I don't even want to know what that is.

36:37.920 --> 36:40.422
<i>My name is Natalie Bloomfield.</i>

36:40.456 --> 36:45.760
<i>And if you've accessed this,
it means you have my body.</i>

36:45.795 --> 36:48.430
<i>I pray Waiman is still alive.</i>

36:51.367 --> 36:53.769
<i>I'm sorry, but as
you know, your state warrant</i>

36:53.770 --> 36:56.171
<i>is invalid because this is a
matter of national security.</i>

36:56.205 --> 37:00.108
- Oh, shoot. Wrong one.
- Clay, do you have the other one?

37:00.142 --> 37:02.244
Right here.

37:04.547 --> 37:06.214
Thank you.

37:07.350 --> 37:08.950
You were helping us the
whole time, weren't you?

37:08.985 --> 37:13.488
Oh, I can do a lot of things.
But I can't investigate a homicide.

37:13.523 --> 37:15.490
<i>That one's federal.</i>

37:15.525 --> 37:17.359
You thought you could hide
behind national security,

37:17.393 --> 37:19.928
do whatever you wanted
in your private company?

37:19.962 --> 37:22.230
You sought out introverted women,

37:22.265 --> 37:24.332
didn't think any of them
would ever stand up to you.

37:24.367 --> 37:27.481
Clay, this is an abuse of power.
What is going on here?

37:27.516 --> 37:30.839
How did you do it? How'd you get
Natalie into your hotel suite?

37:30.873 --> 37:33.475
<i>What? Did you tell her you
had some work to go over?</i>

37:33.509 --> 37:36.378
<i>As a standard, we use
cryptographic interoperability</i>

37:36.412 --> 37:38.380
<i>on this D.O.D. classified document.</i>

37:38.414 --> 37:41.316
<i>But, um, I added this algorithm.</i>

37:41.350 --> 37:44.452
She'd known you forever.
You were like a father to her.

37:44.520 --> 37:47.322
And her boss.

37:47.356 --> 37:50.025
She didn't even see it coming, did she?

37:50.059 --> 37:53.929
Saw what? What are you
implying, detective?

37:53.963 --> 37:56.898
<i>No. Please. Please!</i>

37:56.966 --> 37:59.568
<i>Please! Please stop!</i>

38:05.174 --> 38:07.142
It was consensual sex!

38:07.209 --> 38:11.146
Are you sure?
That's not what Natalie said.

38:11.213 --> 38:14.282
<i>My boss, Christopher Carnaha, raped me.</i>

38:14.350 --> 38:16.017
<i>He has me under surveillance,</i>

38:16.052 --> 38:18.286
<i>even though he thinks
he got away with it,</i>

38:18.354 --> 38:21.890
<i>just as he has dozens of times before.</i>

38:21.924 --> 38:24.626
<i>But he knows that I found others.</i>

38:24.660 --> 38:27.963
You were spying on her to
make sure she wasn't talking.

38:28.030 --> 38:31.199
And that's when you learned she'd
found the other women you'd raped.

38:31.233 --> 38:35.904
<i>They're just as afraid as I am.
But I cannot, in good conscience,</i>

38:35.938 --> 38:39.608
<i>go on with my life and allow
him to rape another woman.</i>

38:39.642 --> 38:42.944
You framed her and you killed her,
you piece of crap.

38:44.012 --> 38:47.776
Clay, please.
The fact that I had sex

38:47.777 --> 38:51.019
with Natalie does not
mean that I killed her.

38:51.087 --> 38:54.990
No. No, it doesn't.
But this does.

38:55.024 --> 38:58.994
<i>Please track this GPS signal.
It's Christopher.</i>

38:59.028 --> 39:01.363
<i>He's got a GPS jammer on his phone,
but I think I've got it.</i>

39:01.397 --> 39:03.904
<i>Track it. Track it to
where I am right now!</i>

39:03.939 --> 39:06.609
We tracked your
phone right to Natalie's body.

39:06.644 --> 39:10.099
It cost her her life, but she beat you.

39:10.134 --> 39:13.441
You're under arrest
for the murder of Natalie Bloomfield.

39:32.128 --> 39:34.496
Don't play with your sutures.

39:34.563 --> 39:36.631
Where did you come from?

39:36.666 --> 39:39.200
- How's your lip?
- It's fine.

39:39.235 --> 39:40.669
You want to see how fine?

39:47.476 --> 39:51.079
- Wow.
- I'm sorry.

39:51.113 --> 39:54.334
I just wanted to see
what that felt like.

39:57.153 --> 40:01.656
I'm gonna go before we have
an awkward conversation.

40:35.124 --> 40:36.624
Jane.

40:40.129 --> 40:44.807
- What are you doing?
- Read it.

40:49.636 --> 40:52.316
<i>"I wasn't expecting this to be so hard.</i>

40:52.351 --> 40:54.724
I dont't know who I am
if I'm not a soldier.

40:54.759 --> 40:57.293
<i>They want me to command
a battalion in the Balkans.</i>

40:57.328 --> 41:00.430
<i>There's room for my wife.</i>

41:00.498 --> 41:04.401
Please come, Jane. Please."

41:04.435 --> 41:08.605
I'm not going.
I'm not gonna marry him.

41:08.639 --> 41:12.709
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, me, too.

41:14.278 --> 41:18.114
I'm not gonna leave everything
to follow him around the world.

41:23.087 --> 41:24.954
What's in your hand?

41:27.316 --> 41:29.745
I think I'm pregnant.
