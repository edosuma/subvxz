WEBVTT

00:00.281 --> 00:02.452
<i>Previously on When Calls the Heart.</i>

00:02.477 --> 00:03.515
The pastor...

00:03.540 --> 00:05.405
If he doesn't make it
to Hope Valley in time,

00:05.430 --> 00:06.992
who will perform the ceremony?

00:07.017 --> 00:08.023
I will.

00:08.048 --> 00:09.656
You're walking me down the aisle.

00:09.681 --> 00:10.880
Oh, perfect.

00:11.100 --> 00:13.434
Your heart is open again, isn't it?

00:16.440 --> 00:18.773
Now it's being pulled in
two different directions.

00:21.011 --> 00:22.644
I thought you might like these.

00:22.874 --> 00:24.007
Lucas.

00:24.032 --> 00:25.007
Nathan.

00:30.970 --> 00:34.478
<i>Clara and Jesse's special
day is almost here.</i>

00:35.013 --> 00:36.603
<i>I love weddings.</i>

00:36.886 --> 00:41.710
<i>Even as a child I knew there was
something magical about them.</i>

00:43.076 --> 00:45.446
<i>But it wasn't until my own wedding day</i>

00:45.601 --> 00:48.966
<i>that I fully understood what
all the excitement was about.</i>

00:50.623 --> 00:52.532
<i>When you find the right person</i>

00:52.760 --> 00:56.640
<i>love and commitment come easy
even when life gets hard.</i>

00:57.300 --> 01:01.562
<i>And I'm so happy that Clara and
Jesse have found each other.</i>

01:10.366 --> 01:11.739
There we go.

01:13.502 --> 01:15.036
Come on.

01:15.155 --> 01:16.538
- Shall we?
- Yes.

01:17.188 --> 01:18.220
Hey, you two.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.193
Rosemary and I would like to give you

01:20.218 --> 01:21.651
an early wedding present.

01:21.686 --> 01:23.853
It's an all-expense paid
trip to Los Angeles.

01:23.888 --> 01:25.127
Oh!

01:26.179 --> 01:28.358
But this was supposed to
be your anniversary trip.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.966
And now it will be your honeymoon trip.

01:31.464 --> 01:32.475
Thank you.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.236
This really wasn't necessary.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.991
It's our pleasure, you two.

01:36.016 --> 01:37.670
Well, if the pastor doesn't show up soon

01:37.695 --> 01:38.952
we won't need a honeymoon

01:38.984 --> 01:40.631
because there will be no wedding.

01:40.656 --> 01:42.752
Well, we did the rehearsal
without a pastor

01:42.777 --> 01:46.512
and if he doesn't show up,
well, there's always Bill.

01:47.844 --> 01:49.048
Ok, you two. Have a good night.

01:49.073 --> 01:50.163
- Goodnight.
- Thank you.

01:50.188 --> 01:52.116
Just say the word. I'm ready.

01:52.331 --> 01:55.500
Pastor Zeke has assured us
he will be here on time.

01:56.855 --> 01:58.755
Oh, Clara.

01:58.780 --> 02:01.248
Don't worry, he'll be here, I promise.

02:01.333 --> 02:03.635
Nothing is going to ruin this wedding.

02:05.591 --> 02:07.514
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

02:09.339 --> 02:11.132
How was the rehearsal dinner?

02:11.596 --> 02:12.862
It was perfect.

02:12.887 --> 02:14.426
That's what I like to hear.

02:16.813 --> 02:18.846
Love certainly is special.

02:21.959 --> 02:23.492
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:23.517 --> 02:25.542
You sound like a hopeless romantic.

02:26.628 --> 02:28.650
More like a hopeful one.

02:29.022 --> 02:30.317
Here.

02:33.104 --> 02:34.364
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:34.389 --> 02:37.971
Two more days and you'll be Mrs.
Clara Flynn.

02:38.343 --> 02:40.495
Sounds like a famous actress.

02:46.305 --> 02:48.651
You're sure you're ok living
here after the wedding?

02:48.968 --> 02:51.130
It's only 'til I build our new home.

02:52.661 --> 02:58.138
Our home is wherever we are together.

03:04.868 --> 03:06.272
Two more days.

03:07.714 --> 03:09.232
Two more days.

03:13.114 --> 03:14.194
Goodnight.

03:14.545 --> 03:15.863
Goodnight.

03:25.518 --> 03:27.792
You seem preoccupied.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.461
All this talk of weddings.

03:31.158 --> 03:33.798
I thought it might bring
up some memories.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.384
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

03:37.619 --> 03:40.365
It's fine. I'm fine.

03:41.191 --> 03:43.906
It was one of the
happiest days of my life.

03:44.226 --> 03:46.405
And I can only hope Clara
and Jesse's wedding

03:46.430 --> 03:48.258
will be just as beautiful.

03:48.392 --> 03:50.292
Well, they certainly seem happy.

03:50.337 --> 03:51.733
Love does that.

03:52.415 --> 03:54.417
Love might be in the air for more people

03:54.442 --> 03:57.072
than just Jesse and Clara.

- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -

04:37.325 --> 04:39.613
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:39.794 --> 04:41.112
I am just here to remind you

04:41.137 --> 04:43.004
of your final fitting this afternoon.

04:43.029 --> 04:44.686
I will be there right after school.

04:45.001 --> 04:46.506
What is that?

04:46.531 --> 04:50.943
Oh, well, this is my
emergency bridal bag.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.818
Just fulfilling one of my many
jobs as matron of honour,

04:54.843 --> 04:57.973
which is to be prepared for
any crisis that might arise

04:57.998 --> 04:59.068
on Clara's wedding day.

04:59.093 --> 05:00.558
Well that's very clever of you.

05:00.583 --> 05:03.351
To which end, do you happen
to have any matches?

05:03.376 --> 05:05.076
Just on the shelf there.

05:11.549 --> 05:14.115
- Did you remember a sewing kit?
- <i>Check.</i>

05:14.140 --> 05:15.459
- Hankie?
- <i>Check.</i>

05:15.484 --> 05:17.373
- Aspirin?
- Oh.

05:17.458 --> 05:19.124
<i>I'll get some from Carson.</i>

05:19.726 --> 05:22.225
Oh, you don't want to press any of them?

05:22.250 --> 05:23.450
Mmm-mmm.

05:23.475 --> 05:25.219
It's not every day that you get flowers

05:25.244 --> 05:27.203
from two handsome admirers.

05:27.841 --> 05:29.006
What?

05:29.688 --> 05:31.540
It's just complicated.

05:32.108 --> 05:35.375
Yes, romance definitely can be that.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.552
- There is no romance.
- Yet.

05:37.577 --> 05:39.951
There is no romance, Rosemary.

05:40.317 --> 05:43.826
I like Nathan and I like Lucas.

05:43.935 --> 05:46.419
They're both wonderful men who I
have no intention of hurting,

05:46.444 --> 05:49.037
so until I've sorted out my feelings

05:49.062 --> 05:51.334
I think it's best we
remain just friends.

05:51.359 --> 05:53.146
Good luck with that.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.901
<i>Where do you want these?</i>

05:58.023 --> 05:59.489
<i>All the way in the back row.</i>

05:59.514 --> 06:01.154
Just right there is perfect.

06:01.179 --> 06:02.992
One more day.

06:03.981 --> 06:05.700
I know.

06:07.974 --> 06:12.665
Uh... Molly was thinking hydrangeas.

06:12.863 --> 06:15.060
Maybe wild flowers
would work much better

06:15.085 --> 06:16.873
with the outdoor theme.

06:17.363 --> 06:19.088
Don't you think?

06:19.886 --> 06:22.091
Yeah, I mean, whatever you want.

06:22.373 --> 06:23.605
It's your day.

06:23.630 --> 06:25.196
It's our day.

06:29.748 --> 06:31.918
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- Yeah.

06:31.943 --> 06:33.075
Molly?

06:38.235 --> 06:40.150
Yes... yes, thank you.

06:43.093 --> 06:44.280
Elizabeth.

06:44.781 --> 06:46.074
Good morning.

06:46.596 --> 06:47.659
Good morning.

06:48.154 --> 06:50.001
I was hoping I'd get a
chance to speak to you.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.341
It's been a while.

06:51.574 --> 06:54.081
I just saw you yesterday
when you picked up Allie.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.955
Yeah, but that doesn't count.

06:55.980 --> 06:57.099
- No?
- No.

06:57.124 --> 06:59.254
No, a dozen kids around, my niece...

06:59.652 --> 07:01.922
I was hoping for something
a little more private.

07:02.315 --> 07:03.815
What did you want to talk about?

07:03.915 --> 07:05.138
The flowers.

07:05.335 --> 07:08.638
More precisely, the ones I gave you.

07:10.980 --> 07:12.576
They were lovely.

07:13.062 --> 07:15.269
But not the only ones you received.

07:16.578 --> 07:17.856
No.

07:19.483 --> 07:21.365
I just want to let you know

07:21.390 --> 07:23.862
that I'm not one to shy
away from competition.

07:24.090 --> 07:25.529
Constable!

07:26.119 --> 07:27.699
You have a call!

07:32.416 --> 07:33.750
Excuse me.

07:46.896 --> 07:48.263
Robert, hi.

07:48.288 --> 07:51.847
There's been something I've
wanted to talk to you about.

07:59.392 --> 08:01.144
You want to be a Mountie?

08:01.338 --> 08:02.900
For a while now.

08:03.219 --> 08:05.486
Well, it's a very honourable profession.

08:05.794 --> 08:08.028
<i>And you don't have to decide
for another few years.</i>

08:08.053 --> 08:09.824
Well, they start recruiting at 17

08:09.849 --> 08:12.994
but I wouldn't become a Mountie
until my 18th birthday.

08:14.909 --> 08:16.409
What about school?

08:16.467 --> 08:18.832
I wouldn't attend my final year.

08:19.094 --> 08:20.709
<i>Elizabeth Thornton?</i>

08:22.594 --> 08:24.316
I'm Pastor Zeke.

08:24.504 --> 08:28.301
Oh, thank you so much for
coming, Pastor Zeke.

08:30.463 --> 08:33.222
We're not finished with this
conversation yet, alright?

08:34.863 --> 08:36.152
Please come inside.

08:36.177 --> 08:37.517
Thank you.

09:21.846 --> 09:23.346
That's a nice office.

09:23.413 --> 09:26.400
And this is a lovely church and school.

09:27.113 --> 09:30.071
Thank you. I think so.

09:30.656 --> 09:32.781
My late husband built it.

09:33.731 --> 09:36.286
Then it's extra special for you.

09:36.494 --> 09:37.953
It is.

09:38.234 --> 09:41.291
And I hope it will be
special for you, too.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.543
Everyone is thrilled you're here.

09:43.972 --> 09:46.254
It's so nice to finally have a home.

09:46.645 --> 09:49.050
Being a travelling
pastor has its rewards

09:49.075 --> 09:50.536
but at the end of the day

09:50.561 --> 09:52.719
I look forward to being
part of a community.

09:53.344 --> 09:55.722
I hear great things about Hope Valley.

09:55.967 --> 09:57.724
Well, they're all true.

10:07.493 --> 10:11.462
Oh, that's the end of it. Whew!

10:11.778 --> 10:13.554
Why don't you take the
rest of the day off?

10:13.579 --> 10:16.536
I'm sure you've got a lot of
last minute things to do.

10:16.743 --> 10:18.543
Yes, you're right.

10:18.943 --> 10:20.287
Hey.

10:21.161 --> 10:22.693
Are you alright?

10:23.789 --> 10:27.878
Oh, just thinking about everyone
who can't be at the wedding.

10:31.343 --> 10:32.910
Your parents.

10:34.604 --> 10:39.639
Well, I know they would
be very proud of you.

10:40.169 --> 10:41.641
As I am.

10:42.204 --> 10:44.200
And I don't have a daughter

10:44.496 --> 10:49.066
but if I did I would want
her to be just like you.

10:51.037 --> 10:52.537
Thank you, Bill.

10:52.564 --> 10:54.196
That's very sweet.

10:56.257 --> 10:58.520
I'm sorry, I'm just nervous

10:58.545 --> 11:00.137
about getting everything done in time.

11:00.162 --> 11:02.013
Yeah, of course.

11:02.384 --> 11:04.418
Is there anything I can
take off your list?

11:04.443 --> 11:08.044
Oh, you could pick up the
arbour from Richard Wolf?

11:08.163 --> 11:09.754
Consider it done.

11:11.272 --> 11:12.810
Thank you.

11:26.270 --> 11:29.857
Robert, may I have a word?

11:31.298 --> 11:32.497
Sure.

11:33.303 --> 11:34.737
Have a seat.

11:37.828 --> 11:39.993
We didn't get to finish
our conversation earlier

11:40.018 --> 11:42.203
about you becoming a Mountie.

11:43.574 --> 11:44.879
Ok.

11:45.113 --> 11:47.082
I respect your decision.

11:48.079 --> 11:50.286
I just don't totally understand
why you wouldn't wait

11:50.311 --> 11:52.280
until after graduation.

11:52.577 --> 11:55.341
I really wanna do this, Mrs. Thornton.

11:55.396 --> 11:56.481
And no offence,

11:56.506 --> 11:59.553
but I feel like I've learned
everything I can from school.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.556
Well, that is a totally different issue.

12:04.986 --> 12:06.918
How do your parents feel about it?

12:06.943 --> 12:08.676
My dad's for it.

12:08.963 --> 12:10.230
My mom's worried.

12:10.421 --> 12:12.400
She thinks it's too dangerous.

12:13.563 --> 12:15.735
Well, your mom has a point.

12:17.119 --> 12:20.407
A Mountie's life can be very dangerous.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.577
I understand why you feel that way.

12:28.324 --> 12:31.753
Have you talked to Constable
Grant about what it's like?

12:32.405 --> 12:35.047
No. Do you think he'd talk to me?

12:35.471 --> 12:37.207
I don't see why not.

12:37.583 --> 12:39.450
Would you like me to ask him?

12:39.547 --> 12:40.680
Really?

12:40.817 --> 12:42.429
Thank you, Mrs. Thornton.

12:42.697 --> 12:44.348
You're welcome, Robert.

12:54.367 --> 12:57.411
Clara, those bridesmaid's
dresses are just beautiful.

12:57.436 --> 12:58.802
How did you find time to sew them

12:58.827 --> 13:00.435
with everything else you've had to do?

13:00.460 --> 13:02.627
Oh, well I can't take all the credit.

13:02.714 --> 13:05.014
Rosemary has been a huge help.

13:05.039 --> 13:06.772
Well, is there anything I can help with?

13:06.797 --> 13:08.997
Um, do you wanna track down a pastor?

13:09.076 --> 13:11.590
No need, Pastor Zeke is here.

13:11.786 --> 13:13.503
Oh, finally.

13:13.528 --> 13:14.545
How is he?

13:14.570 --> 13:16.934
He's young but sweet.

13:17.252 --> 13:20.217
Well, I guess that's one thing
I can cross off my list.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.367
Is everything ok?

13:23.659 --> 13:25.305
Just wedding jitters.

13:25.795 --> 13:28.601
Well, is there anything else on
that list that you need done?

13:28.828 --> 13:32.258
Uh, well I still need
my something borrowed,

13:32.283 --> 13:34.552
something blue, something
old and something new.

13:34.577 --> 13:36.481
Your dress is the new,

13:36.506 --> 13:38.598
your hair comb can be something blue,

13:38.623 --> 13:40.534
I thought you were gonna
wear your mother's earrings

13:40.559 --> 13:42.129
for something old and, well,

13:42.154 --> 13:44.324
that just leaves something borrowed.

13:44.777 --> 13:46.577
I couldn't find the earrings.

13:46.602 --> 13:48.051
- Oh.
- Oh.

13:48.215 --> 13:51.247
It's ok, I'm sure there's
something else that I can use.

13:51.465 --> 13:54.265
Well, I can add a few things
to my bag just in case.

13:54.290 --> 13:55.753
Mmmhmm.

14:02.322 --> 14:03.354
Hi.

14:03.417 --> 14:06.012
I need your help with Robert.

14:08.474 --> 14:11.090
Sure, yeah. How can I help?

14:11.288 --> 14:13.980
He told me today he wants
to become a Mountie.

14:14.690 --> 14:17.775
And I suppose you want me
to talk him out of it.

14:18.206 --> 14:20.114
No, no, no. It's Robert's decision.

14:20.139 --> 14:23.107
I just... I want him
to have all the facts

14:23.132 --> 14:24.632
before he decides.

14:25.588 --> 14:28.744
So you'd be alright with
him joining the Mounties?

14:29.401 --> 14:32.999
If I'm being honest it wouldn't
be my first choice for him

14:33.833 --> 14:36.127
but I do think it's a noble profession.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.851
Really?

14:39.342 --> 14:40.607
Yes.

14:41.463 --> 14:44.676
I'll admit when I first met Jack
I didn't quite understand it

14:45.036 --> 14:46.919
but now I understand it's
about wanting to make

14:46.944 --> 14:48.645
the world a better place.

14:50.066 --> 14:51.933
What could be wrong with that?

14:56.966 --> 15:00.191
What do you think about
"Love always protects"

15:00.216 --> 15:03.822
"always trusts, always
hopes, always perseveres"?

15:04.026 --> 15:06.490
Corinthians 13:7-8.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.492
It's nice.

15:08.685 --> 15:10.161
What do you think?

15:10.646 --> 15:12.213
Oh, it's pretty.

15:12.238 --> 15:17.254
Or there's, "Be completely
humble and gentle; be patient,

15:17.366 --> 15:19.920
"bearing with one another in love."

15:20.506 --> 15:22.340
Ephesians 4:2.

15:23.128 --> 15:26.010
Well, truthfully, Pastor,

15:26.282 --> 15:28.182
whichever one you feel is best for us.

15:28.207 --> 15:29.262
Yeah.

15:30.573 --> 15:32.299
There are so many to choose from.

15:32.324 --> 15:35.102
I was hoping you'd have an opinion.

15:35.917 --> 15:37.437
Mmm...

15:37.518 --> 15:38.897
No.

15:39.753 --> 15:43.443
Ok, then I promise to come
up with the perfect one.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.257
Do you have your vows written?

15:45.292 --> 15:46.738
Yes.

15:47.168 --> 15:48.353
There you go.

15:48.378 --> 15:50.192
I didn't realize you would need them.

15:50.217 --> 15:51.434
<i>They're of great help.</i>

15:51.459 --> 15:53.620
I don't want to repeat any sentiments.

15:53.943 --> 15:55.976
Can I get them to you later?

15:56.001 --> 15:59.544
I just need to transfer
them over so I have a copy.

16:00.180 --> 16:01.586
Of course.

16:02.130 --> 16:03.430
Alrighty then.

16:03.455 --> 16:04.731
I'll see you both tomorrow.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.745
- Thank you, Pastor.
- Thank you.

16:09.291 --> 16:10.434
Ok.

16:11.452 --> 16:12.951
What's going on?

16:13.015 --> 16:14.349
Nothing.

16:14.742 --> 16:18.354
Just all these last-minute things to do.

16:18.749 --> 16:20.349
I think I'm a little overwhelmed.

16:20.395 --> 16:21.857
I understand.

16:21.991 --> 16:23.891
But so what if something
doesn't get done?

16:23.952 --> 16:25.418
Then it doesn't get done.

16:25.756 --> 16:30.449
Tomorrow's about you and
me, not flowers, not food.

16:31.178 --> 16:33.660
You and me.

16:34.911 --> 16:35.993
Ok?

16:36.018 --> 16:37.252
Mmmhmm.

16:37.282 --> 16:38.707
Come here.

16:46.438 --> 16:47.840
Smells good.

16:47.967 --> 16:49.317
Our judge is a great cook.

16:49.389 --> 16:50.614
Judge?

16:50.776 --> 16:52.692
<i>I'll bet there's a great
story behind that.</i>

16:52.832 --> 16:54.764
Yeah, but it's long.

16:56.005 --> 16:57.405
I got time.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.909
Robert, let Mr. Henderson
eat his dinner.

17:06.439 --> 17:08.338
When does Mr. Henderson get out?

17:08.411 --> 17:10.281
When the transfer wagon arrives.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.321
<i>Seems like a nice guy.</i>

17:14.898 --> 17:17.328
He's accused of stealing
a couple horses.

17:18.261 --> 17:19.915
Do you think he's guilty?

17:20.962 --> 17:22.834
That's up to a court of law to decide.

17:23.224 --> 17:25.611
Well, yeah, but don't
you feel bad for him?

17:25.717 --> 17:27.317
<i>He's got kids.</i>

17:28.715 --> 17:30.142
Do you think he's lying?

17:30.360 --> 17:33.797
Robert, a Mountie cannot
get emotionally involved

17:33.822 --> 17:35.190
with a prisoner.

17:35.389 --> 17:39.185
We have to maintain a
professional distance.

17:39.327 --> 17:40.519
<i>You understand?</i>

17:40.923 --> 17:42.223
Yeah.

17:43.267 --> 17:45.273
<i>But he still seems like a nice guy.</i>

17:46.129 --> 17:47.424
Yeah.

17:54.848 --> 17:56.147
Hi.

17:56.197 --> 17:57.265
Hello.

17:58.847 --> 18:00.501
You bought more books.

18:00.621 --> 18:02.921
A library can never have too many.

18:05.266 --> 18:07.099
I just came to return a few.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.127
I can put them away for you if you like.

18:09.178 --> 18:10.605
Thanks.

18:16.146 --> 18:23.577
So I will just see you at the...
at the wedding.

18:23.819 --> 18:26.857
Yes, you will.

18:35.058 --> 18:36.784
See you around, kid.

18:39.302 --> 18:41.969
And that was a prisoner transfer.

18:43.164 --> 18:45.532
<i>Help! Constable Gran!</i>

18:45.557 --> 18:47.614
He's getting away!

19:08.600 --> 19:11.012
<i>Well done, Constable!</i>

19:14.785 --> 19:17.278
<i>He's not getting away now.</i>

19:28.245 --> 19:29.829
Elizabeth.

19:30.313 --> 19:32.673
Why are you still working?

19:33.046 --> 19:34.613
It keeps my mind busy.

19:34.696 --> 19:37.927
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

19:40.738 --> 19:42.849
You haven't been yourself lately,

19:43.431 --> 19:47.271
and this is more than
just pre-wedding jitters.

19:48.864 --> 19:50.607
Please talk to me.

20:13.378 --> 20:17.258
"I promise you all my love
today and ever after.

20:17.841 --> 20:22.598
"You are my heart, my soul,
my reason for laughter.

20:22.994 --> 20:28.615
"Forever for us begins with
I do, and I do so much.

20:28.749 --> 20:31.314
"So very much love you."

20:34.153 --> 20:35.652
Beautiful.

20:36.971 --> 20:39.281
They were Peter's wedding vows to me.

20:39.772 --> 20:41.490
I was looking for my mother's earrings

20:41.515 --> 20:43.711
and I found this instead.

20:46.164 --> 20:47.630
And now I...

20:48.403 --> 20:50.876
I can't stop thinking about Peter

20:51.259 --> 20:53.796
and how much it hurt to lose him.

20:54.178 --> 20:56.130
<i>How much it still hurts.</i>

20:57.771 --> 20:59.760
And now nothing makes sense.

21:00.077 --> 21:01.963
Oh, Clara.

21:03.519 --> 21:05.850
What if something were
to happen to Jesse?

21:07.496 --> 21:10.603
I don't think that I can go
through that pain again.

21:12.317 --> 21:15.442
You can't live your life on what-if's.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.935
You and Jesse are going to have

21:17.960 --> 21:20.655
so many wonderful years together.

21:21.719 --> 21:23.324
Elizabeth...

21:24.496 --> 21:27.865
we both know how quickly
someone can be taken from you.

21:30.955 --> 21:32.430
Yes.

21:34.381 --> 21:37.161
But I also know that loving Jack

21:37.186 --> 21:40.050
was one of the greatest
things I have ever done.

21:41.731 --> 21:45.054
I don't regret the time I had
with him for one moment.

21:48.185 --> 21:51.477
And if I had the chance
to do it all over again

21:52.437 --> 21:55.982
knowing exactly how it would end,

21:57.283 --> 21:59.236
I would still do it.

22:01.462 --> 22:03.072
Wouldn't you?

22:13.374 --> 22:14.876
Thank you.

22:29.343 --> 22:30.752
Oh, Elizabeth.

22:30.777 --> 22:32.746
- Good morning.
- You're early.

22:32.771 --> 22:34.324
I have something for you.

22:34.349 --> 22:35.731
Oh.

22:45.253 --> 22:47.450
<i>It was my grandmother's.</i>

22:49.554 --> 22:51.290
For your something borrowed.

22:51.327 --> 22:55.334
Oh, it's beautiful.

22:55.718 --> 22:58.653
And will go perfectly with
my mother's earrings.

22:58.806 --> 23:00.681
- You found them?
- I did.

23:00.706 --> 23:02.715
Oh, that's wonderful.

23:05.147 --> 23:07.101
So how are you feeling today?

23:07.562 --> 23:09.134
A little tired.

23:09.397 --> 23:11.724
I was working on my vows all night.

23:14.369 --> 23:16.354
Thank you for yesterday.

23:16.925 --> 23:18.524
You're welcome.

23:19.551 --> 23:22.944
You really do deserve
every happiness, Clara.

23:24.867 --> 23:26.274
So do you.

23:26.691 --> 23:30.359
Oh, well I am blessed every day.

23:32.487 --> 23:35.001
Yes, you are.

23:35.225 --> 23:37.613
But that's not what I was talking about.

23:38.052 --> 23:40.306
Jack would not want you to be alone

23:40.539 --> 23:43.005
any more than Peter would want me to be.

23:43.297 --> 23:45.130
<i>Love is out there, Elizabeth.</i>

23:45.228 --> 23:48.178
You just have to open yourself up to it.

23:57.368 --> 23:58.686
Elizabeth.

23:59.750 --> 24:00.912
Good morning.

24:02.016 --> 24:03.649
Hello, young man.

24:05.237 --> 24:07.705
Yeah, what a handsome man you are.

24:07.944 --> 24:09.575
Everything ok?

24:10.038 --> 24:12.493
Yes, I'm just hungry.

24:12.869 --> 24:15.404
Does your jaw always clench
like that when you're hungry?

24:17.522 --> 24:19.189
Good morning.

24:19.266 --> 24:20.710
Morning.

24:21.149 --> 24:22.447
Good morning.

24:22.694 --> 24:23.994
Hi, Jack.

24:24.681 --> 24:26.915
I heard you had a bit of
excitement yesterday.

24:26.940 --> 24:29.177
You should have seen Constable Grant.

24:29.295 --> 24:31.062
He didn't even hesitate.

24:31.259 --> 24:33.292
The minute he heard
Florence call for help

24:33.390 --> 24:34.932
he was out the door.

24:35.104 --> 24:37.059
I don't think he's afraid of anything.

24:38.246 --> 24:39.849
You know what you are considering

24:39.874 --> 24:43.650
is a very big decision.

24:45.354 --> 24:47.821
It's ok for you to take
your time with it.

24:48.079 --> 24:49.488
<i>Alright?</i>

25:06.554 --> 25:07.965
You ok?

25:11.785 --> 25:16.140
Do you uh, do you wanna talk about it?

25:18.001 --> 25:20.686
I don't think I'm cut
out to be a Mountie.

25:21.456 --> 25:23.190
Why do you say that?

25:25.374 --> 25:27.605
Well, I was wrong about Mr. Henderson

25:27.630 --> 25:29.904
and I was really scared
when you ran out after him.

25:30.364 --> 25:31.988
You don't think I was?

25:32.219 --> 25:33.510
You were?

25:33.535 --> 25:35.179
Of course.

25:35.632 --> 25:38.537
But I took an oath to serve and protect.

25:38.894 --> 25:40.790
It's not easy, is it?

25:42.521 --> 25:44.126
No, it's not.

25:45.148 --> 25:48.381
But it's my job. And I love it.

25:49.083 --> 25:53.719
Listen, Robert, I can't
make this decision for you

25:54.307 --> 25:55.735
but I can tell you one thing.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.014
When I was your age,

25:57.904 --> 26:00.253
I was nowhere near ready
to become a Mountie.

26:17.444 --> 26:19.402
Oh, I love your necklace.

26:19.427 --> 26:21.707
Mmm, it's my something borrowed.

26:21.732 --> 26:24.546
Oh, well it will look perfect
with your wedding dress.

26:24.571 --> 26:25.996
- Nice choice.
- Thank you.

26:26.191 --> 26:28.388
Clara, you could walk down
the aisle in a potato sack

26:28.413 --> 26:30.774
<i>and you would still be the
most beautiful bride.</i>

26:32.946 --> 26:35.353
I just can't believe it's finally here.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.320
And everything's perfect.

26:39.378 --> 26:40.578
Ladies!

26:40.603 --> 26:41.666
Bill!

26:41.691 --> 26:43.103
<i>Have you looked outside?</i>

26:43.128 --> 26:45.916
I just got off the phone with
the Union City Mountie station.

26:45.941 --> 26:47.142
They're getting hammered.

26:47.167 --> 26:49.305
Looks like this rain is gonna
continue through the night.

26:49.330 --> 26:51.853
Continue? When did it start?

26:51.878 --> 26:54.011
<i>About a half hour ago.</i>

26:55.881 --> 26:58.242
Well, I didn't hear anything.

26:58.820 --> 27:00.453
Because of the music.

27:00.478 --> 27:01.953
<i>Oh, no!</i>

27:02.788 --> 27:05.125
<i>It's really starting to come down.</i>

27:09.724 --> 27:12.215
I should have never planned
an outdoor wedding.

27:12.414 --> 27:14.425
I don't know what I was thinking.

27:14.666 --> 27:18.317
You were thinking that it
would be fun and different.

27:18.731 --> 27:24.019
But the weather this time of
year is very unpredictable.

27:24.508 --> 27:27.314
I think we need to move the
wedding into the church.

27:29.332 --> 27:31.098
I'll make the arrangements.

27:31.123 --> 27:32.270
Mmmhmm.

27:35.264 --> 27:37.599
I'm sure it will be just as pretty.

27:37.954 --> 27:40.034
Yes, you're right.

27:40.514 --> 27:43.663
It just won't be the outdoor
wedding I was hoping for.

27:44.782 --> 27:47.042
Rosemary, hold on a moment.

27:47.401 --> 27:50.372
Just... give me a few hours.

27:50.529 --> 27:52.162
To do what?

27:56.599 --> 27:58.099
You'll see.

27:59.591 --> 28:02.139
Hold on a moment, Elizabeth.

28:02.856 --> 28:05.935
You'll get soaked if you
don't have an umbrella.

28:06.209 --> 28:07.875
Thank you.

28:17.497 --> 28:18.865
<i>Mike!</i>

28:18.890 --> 28:21.283
Grab everyone you can and
meet me by the pond!

28:28.293 --> 28:29.815
Carson? Molly?

28:29.840 --> 28:32.129
<i>Grab everyone you can and
meet me by the pond.</i>

28:33.432 --> 28:34.597
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:34.622 --> 28:35.666
Is everything ok?

28:35.691 --> 28:38.026
I need your help. Gather
everyone you can and meet me...

28:38.051 --> 28:40.095
At the pond, yeah. I know.

28:44.137 --> 28:46.437
Just on the table there. Thank you.

28:46.462 --> 28:47.828
Where would you like these?

28:47.853 --> 28:50.437
Um... there please, for now.

28:54.350 --> 28:55.569
Thank you.

28:55.781 --> 28:58.196
Nathan, I could use a ladder

28:58.221 --> 29:01.158
and Lucas, all of the string
you can get your hands on.

29:01.351 --> 29:04.010
Mike, please buy up all of
the candles at mercantile.

29:04.035 --> 29:08.070
And Kevin... Kevin, all of the
wildflowers you can find.

29:08.095 --> 29:10.792
And everyone else go get the chairs.

29:15.118 --> 29:17.298
I don't see Elizabeth anywhere.

29:17.591 --> 29:20.958
It's only been two hours.

29:20.983 --> 29:22.255
Give her a few more minutes.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.305
It's raining even harder.

29:24.770 --> 29:26.269
I know.

29:26.294 --> 29:29.896
You know, many cultures believe
rain is a sign of good luck.

29:30.071 --> 29:32.557
I think all this rain
means smooth sailing

29:32.582 --> 29:34.356
for your marriage.

29:38.749 --> 29:42.072
Yes. Fiona is right.

29:42.630 --> 29:47.203
You and Jesse have already been
through the storm and survived.

29:47.613 --> 29:49.373
What's a little rain?

29:51.049 --> 29:52.956
- Look who I found.
- <i>Elizabeth.</i>

29:52.981 --> 29:54.944
- Where have you been?
- <i>No time to explain.</i>

29:54.969 --> 29:56.921
We've got a wedding to get to.

29:57.272 --> 29:59.425
Now let's get dressed, ladies.

30:11.327 --> 30:12.360
Psst.

30:12.385 --> 30:14.085
We're ready.

30:19.175 --> 30:20.862
Let's go.

30:43.705 --> 30:45.606
You're a wizard.

30:45.631 --> 30:47.677
I had a lot of help.

30:51.756 --> 30:53.123
Wow.

31:07.140 --> 31:09.326
You ready to do this?

31:13.306 --> 31:15.082
Absolutely.

31:16.417 --> 31:21.088
If you cry I'll cry, so
try and keep it together.

31:55.512 --> 31:58.418
<i>Everyone, please be seated.</i>

32:00.074 --> 32:04.437
Clara, you make me so
happy every single day.

32:04.735 --> 32:06.101
Even when you're mad at me.

32:10.085 --> 32:13.749
I still can't believe I'm the
lucky guy who gets to marry you.

32:45.112 --> 32:48.567
Jesse, there was a time in
my life when I didn't think

32:48.592 --> 32:51.470
that it would be possible
to ever love again.

32:51.779 --> 32:54.802
<i>You swept into my life
and changed all that.</i>

32:55.128 --> 32:59.919
And despite my doubts you
never gave up on us.

33:01.161 --> 33:06.860
Thank you for loving me more
than I ever thought possible.

33:08.618 --> 33:16.407
I give you my heart, my love, my faith,

33:17.464 --> 33:23.956
my life, now and forever,

33:24.799 --> 33:27.120
because that's what I want with you.

33:27.926 --> 33:29.259
Forever.

33:49.546 --> 33:53.903
Clara and Jesse, you have
sealed your relationship

33:54.114 --> 33:57.278
<i>by giving and receiving rings
and the exchange of vows.</i>

33:57.408 --> 34:00.289
Just as the grains of sand
can never be separated,

34:00.780 --> 34:04.661
<i>so may your marriage
be forever and a day.</i>

34:04.993 --> 34:08.324
With the power vested in
me I now pronounce you

34:08.350 --> 34:11.059
husband and wife.

34:12.536 --> 34:14.449
You may kiss your bride.

34:24.483 --> 34:26.020
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:26.074 --> 34:29.277
may I present to you
Clara and Jesse Flynn.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.588
Elizabeth.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.672
Thank you.

34:50.822 --> 34:52.232
How is little Jack?

34:52.257 --> 34:54.467
So tired, he fell straight to sleep.

34:54.492 --> 34:55.525
I hope he stays that way

34:55.550 --> 34:57.650
so Laura can get some studying done.

34:57.675 --> 34:58.908
Did I miss the cake?

34:58.933 --> 35:01.184
No. Moments away.

35:15.009 --> 35:16.241
Thank you.

35:17.617 --> 35:18.784
For what?

35:19.073 --> 35:20.452
Robert.

35:20.793 --> 35:24.382
He told me he decided earlier
that being a Mountie can wait.

35:24.578 --> 35:26.500
He wants to enjoy being a kid.

35:26.698 --> 35:28.293
That's great.

35:28.891 --> 35:30.797
He'll make a good Mountie one day.

35:31.361 --> 35:32.799
Yes, he will.

35:33.157 --> 35:34.800
Nathan, Elizabeth.

35:34.890 --> 35:36.623
Turn right this way.

35:36.814 --> 35:37.913
Oh.

35:37.938 --> 35:38.971
Uh...

35:38.996 --> 35:40.529
<i>Together.</i>

35:40.554 --> 35:42.029
<i>Wait, hold that right there.</i>

35:43.030 --> 35:44.819
- It's a keeper.
- Thank you.

35:46.035 --> 35:48.052
<i>Alright everyone, gather around.</i>

35:48.077 --> 35:49.546
Jesse, Clara?

35:49.571 --> 35:51.921
<i>It is time to cut your cake. Lucas?</i>

35:55.264 --> 35:56.906
Oh, my goodness.

36:00.098 --> 36:01.530
Hold that smile.

36:03.136 --> 36:04.955
Great.

36:08.405 --> 36:10.705
Ok, excuse me everyone, if I
could have your attention.

36:10.944 --> 36:14.335
Um, first of all, thank
you all for coming.

36:14.525 --> 36:16.336
And a special thank you to Elizabeth

36:16.361 --> 36:18.304
<i>and everyone else who
helped turn the saloon</i>

36:18.329 --> 36:21.222
<i>into this magical wonderland
for Jesse and Clara.</i>

36:21.791 --> 36:24.349
And now, for you, young man.

36:24.950 --> 36:29.085
I have known Jesse for
quite some time now

36:29.321 --> 36:31.015
<i>and although I would like to think</i>

36:31.040 --> 36:36.113
<i>that I have impacted his
life in some small way,</i>

36:37.020 --> 36:41.689
the truth is you've impacted
my life in more ways

36:41.714 --> 36:43.243
<i>than I could have ever imagined.</i>

36:43.556 --> 36:46.747
Not only is he a vital
part of my business

36:47.145 --> 36:51.918
but he's also an important part
of my family and a good friend.

36:52.530 --> 36:57.125
So if you would all please join
me in a toast to the groom.

36:57.706 --> 37:02.851
Today and forever may you be
as happy as you are right now.

37:03.145 --> 37:04.411
- Cheers, Jesse.
- Thank you.

37:04.506 --> 37:05.574
<i>Cheers.</i>

37:05.599 --> 37:06.843
<i>- Cheers.
- Cheers, Jesse.</i>

37:06.868 --> 37:07.880
<i>Here, here.</i>

37:07.905 --> 37:09.444
Cheers.

37:11.773 --> 37:13.571
That was a very good speech.

37:13.596 --> 37:15.062
Thank you, sweetheart.

37:16.590 --> 37:18.446
Alright, everyone.

37:18.860 --> 37:24.280
Clara, well I just want to
thank you for allowing me...

37:25.075 --> 37:29.040
allowing all of us, to be a
part of your special day.

37:29.256 --> 37:32.859
And now don't either of
you forget that marriage

37:32.884 --> 37:34.984
isn't about how much
you say "I love you",

37:35.009 --> 37:36.775
although that is very nice.

37:38.957 --> 37:41.177
But rather what you do to prove it.

37:41.728 --> 37:44.222
May you both have a long
and happy marriage.

37:44.952 --> 37:46.807
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.267
Cheers.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.687
Oh, now Clara, Bill,

37:51.821 --> 37:54.774
it's time for the father daughter dance.

37:57.144 --> 37:58.736
Do you mind holding this?

37:58.764 --> 38:00.130
Maestro?

38:00.295 --> 38:02.531
<i>Strike up the music.</i>

38:06.492 --> 38:08.256
May I have this dance?

38:08.354 --> 38:11.123
You most certainly may.

38:11.568 --> 38:13.918
Is it everything you hoped it would be?

38:14.166 --> 38:15.766
Even better.

38:16.479 --> 38:17.846
Thank you.

38:17.983 --> 38:19.082
For what?

38:19.212 --> 38:20.841
For being here.

38:21.276 --> 38:23.469
Being someone I can always depend on.

38:25.491 --> 38:27.640
I'll never forget this day.

38:28.030 --> 38:29.641
Me either.

38:34.271 --> 38:37.022
Thank you so much. For everything.

38:37.052 --> 38:38.284
Oh, Clara.

38:38.561 --> 38:40.045
It was my pleasure.

38:40.369 --> 38:42.896
Have a wonderful honeymoon.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.699
We will.

38:46.291 --> 38:48.207
Rosemary, don't forget the bouquet.

38:48.232 --> 38:50.498
Oh. Oh, Clara. Clara!

38:50.523 --> 38:52.956
You forgot to toss the bouquet.

38:53.689 --> 38:55.145
Alright, ladies!

38:55.170 --> 38:58.271
All the single ladies, gather around.

38:58.296 --> 39:02.174
It is time for Clara
to toss the bouquet.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.385
<i>Elizabeth?</i>

39:06.968 --> 39:08.388
Get up here.

39:09.553 --> 39:11.176
Mmmhmm. Now.

39:17.457 --> 39:19.057
On the count of three.

39:19.082 --> 39:21.986
One, two...

39:22.900 --> 39:24.697
<i>Oh!</i>

39:36.808 --> 39:38.389
Can't hide from fate.

39:40.866 --> 39:42.840
Thank you for everything.

39:43.446 --> 39:46.719
Especially for making our day perfect.

39:52.475 --> 39:54.893
Have a wonderful honeymoon.

40:06.466 --> 40:07.999
Goodbye, everyone.

40:08.081 --> 40:09.514
Bye.

40:10.582 --> 40:13.003
- Lee, you have to drive them to the
- Right.

40:13.028 --> 40:14.878
Railway station. Ok.

40:26.706 --> 40:29.016
You did this, didn't you?

40:29.041 --> 40:30.846
<i>Coming through.</i>

40:38.319 --> 40:39.618
Now don't worry,

40:39.643 --> 40:41.741
Lee is going to drop them
off at the train station

40:41.766 --> 40:44.231
- and come back for us.
- There's no rush.

40:52.953 --> 40:55.454
Isn't love wonderful?

40:59.617 --> 41:01.617
<i>Love is wonderful.</i>

41:05.454 --> 41:08.355
<i>The love you feel for your child.</i>

41:08.646 --> 41:11.762
<i>As well as the love
between husband and wife.</i>

41:13.294 --> 41:15.266
<i>And friends.</i>

41:16.466 --> 41:18.381
<i>And possibly...</i>

41:19.127 --> 41:21.313
<i>someone new.</i>
