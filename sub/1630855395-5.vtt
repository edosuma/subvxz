WEBVTT

1
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.541
Alone at last.

2
00:00:49.958 --> 00:00:51.000
What a night.

3
00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:55.208
I heard they put an aphrodisiac
in the wine.

4
00:00:56.416 --> 00:00:57.541
Are you surprised?

5
00:01:09.291 --> 00:01:11.541
Did you see what Sabrina was wearing,
by the way?

6
00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:15.291
- She's older than me by about...
- Yen.

7
00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:19.791
Hmm. I'm just glad it's over.

8
00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.708
Are you sure about this?

9
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:40.791
Are you?

10
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.583
I don't know which I'd like to do more,
tear this costume off

11
00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:54.083
or run Stregobor through
with the nearest ice sculpture.

12
00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:56.125
Look how she hangs on him.

13
00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:00.250
Aah, the White Wolf.

14
00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:03.416
- Gelda! Come here.
- How wonderful!

15
00:02:20.916 --> 00:02:22.333
Thanks for coming.

16
00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:23.458
Mmm!

17
00:02:24.416 --> 00:02:25.458
That's right!

18
00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:28.666
- Is there always this much staring?
- No.

19
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.625
- Come over here!
- It's all for us.

20
00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:34.208
Get used to it.
They'll be watching us all night.

21
00:02:34.291 --> 00:02:35.375
Oh. Good.

22
00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:38.500
Now, you should know the territory
before we step in.

23
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:43.416
Over there, we have Sabrina Glevissig
and Marti Sodergren.

24
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.300
- They're... passionate.
- ...have some fun...

25
00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:53.166
By the fountain, we have Margarita
Laux-Antille, current headmistress.

26
00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.458
And Keira Metz. Quite the spitfire.

27
00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:59.541
We have Carduin, Bianca, Marquard,

28
00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:01.458
Detmold and his brother Drithelm,

29
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:03.458
Radcliffe the Obnoxious.

30
00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:07.291
Artaud Terranova,
good mage, even better drunk.

31
00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:10.583
Vilgefortz, who's grown on me
despite my best efforts.

32
00:03:10.666 --> 00:03:12.791
Tissaia de Vries,
whom you already know.

33
00:03:12.875 --> 00:03:14.333
And Gerhart of Aelle.

34
00:03:14.416 --> 00:03:15.291
- I was saying...
- What?

35
00:03:15.375 --> 00:03:17.208
The oldest living sorcerer.

36
00:03:17.708 --> 00:03:20.125
Are you expecting me
to remember all those names?

37
00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:22.208
I thought you went to Oxenfurt?

38
00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:23.500
Hmm.

39
00:03:30.708 --> 00:03:32.291
Don't even think about it.

40
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.375
I gave you my word.

41
00:03:39.416 --> 00:03:41.458
She's safe in Loxia until dawn.

42
00:03:42.333 --> 00:03:45.250
When the ball ends
and the true conclave begins...

43
00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:47.708
...then we'll make our move.

44
00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:51.291
Tonight it's all about loosening spirits.

45
00:03:51.375 --> 00:03:54.500
And inspiring conviviality
in one perfect evening.

46
00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.791
- So behave yourself.
- I always behave myself.

47
00:03:57.875 --> 00:03:59.916
You have no memory of my party in Rinde?

48
00:04:00.416 --> 00:04:03.583
To say nothing of enchanted hedgehogs
and the Law of Surprise?

49
00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:05.916
That was complicated.

50
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.375
Well, this is simple.

51
00:04:08.083 --> 00:04:10.250
We need this ball
to go off without a hitch,

52
00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.708
so please... dearest,

53
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:14.916
stop eating like an underfed ghoul.

54
00:04:16.416 --> 00:04:20.416
When someone asks to speak to you,
you must accept, and quickly.

55
00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:26.458
And no matter how ludicrously
anyone is dressed, don't stare.

56
00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:28.416
Yennefer.

57
00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:33.916
And her witcher.

58
00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:37.125
We haven't yet had the pleasure.

59
00:04:39.708 --> 00:04:44.291
Geralt, this is Sabrina Glevissig
of Ard Carraigh, a school friend of mine.

60
00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:47.958
We've welcomed our share of spies,
thieves, and murderers at Aretuza,

61
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.250
but not yet hosted a witcher.

62
00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:55.416
- Huh.
- Yen's been hiding you for far too long.

63
00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:05.833
You look hungry.

64
00:05:05.916 --> 00:05:08.000
Would you like a taste?

65
00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:10.583
What do you... What do you think...

66
00:05:10.666 --> 00:05:11.666
witcher?

67
00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:18.875
I think Yen looks particularly lovely
this evening. Don't you?

68
00:05:22.666 --> 00:05:25.375
And he's not even lying. How dull.

69
00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:27.833
- Sabrina, that's no way to treat a guest.
- Hmm.

70
00:05:27.916 --> 00:05:29.875
He has so little experience in telepathy.

71
00:05:29.958 --> 00:05:33.833
Why did you bring your pet along,
if not for us to, uh...

72
00:05:35.166 --> 00:05:36.291
play with him?

73
00:05:36.791 --> 00:05:38.833
Dearest, why don't you go and get a drink?

74
00:05:38.916 --> 00:05:40.166
That's a great idea.

75
00:05:42.291 --> 00:05:44.500
What on earth
do you think you're playing at?

76
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.083
- Yen, do you know what's better than sex?
- What?

77
00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:50.708
Getting a rise
out of the Savior of Sodden.

- I wouldn't miss it.
- Welcome back.

92
00:06:30.916 --> 00:06:35.583
Remember, you need to build bridges
with Artorius as well, not just Stregobor.

93
00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.958
Whilst we're doing pastoral analogies,
are you mending any fences?

94
00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:44.708
...just like the rest
of this den of snobs and liars.

95
00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:48.458
Here's hoping you convinced her to behave.
There's no room for error tonight.

96
00:06:48.541 --> 00:06:50.142
- Tissaia...
- What?

97
00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:52.958
Trust in what you see. Hmm?

98
00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:56.083
Give Yen at least a couple of hours
to piss everyone off.

99
00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:57.666
Excuse me.

100
00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.333
- Dijkstra...
- Step aside, mage.

101
00:07:00.833 --> 00:07:03.017
- Must be a reason for it.
- Ahem...

102
00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:08.541
You know, Philippa, I should scold you
for monopolizing the witcher's time.

103
00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:13.708
Geralt of Rivia, it is good
to have another non-magical brother here,

104
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:16.583
and a... well, fellow commoner, if you will.

105

♪ All is not... ♪

106
00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:23.416
Philippa, I need to speak
to the witcher alone.

107
00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:25.375
Man to man.

108
00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.291
Hmm.

109
00:07:32.583 --> 00:07:35.541
"Man to man." Typical Dijkstra.

110
00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:39.333
You know those two
are going to be a problem tomorrow.

111
00:07:39.416 --> 00:07:42.916
Of course. Only a fool would trust
a spymaster and his mage.

112
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:47.708
- Always more trouble than they're worth.
- And they're clearly up to something.

113
00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:50.416
As is to be expected, but one would hope

114
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.416
they'd at least provide enough gossip
to earn their invitation.

115
00:07:56.833 --> 00:07:58.458
Hmm?

116
00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:01.208
I love watching you think.

117
00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:04.125
But I had so much more to say.

118
00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:08.851
We'll go back to it in a moment.

00:08:18.791 --> 00:08:21.166
This conclave may gather the mages,

123
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.583
but it can't change the inevitable.

124
00:08:23.666 --> 00:08:26.958
One would be wise to abandon neutrality
and choose a side.

125
00:08:27.041 --> 00:08:30.333
Redania is your only hope
of keeping the Lion Cub safe.

126
00:08:31.166 --> 00:08:33.250
Speak in simple terms, Dijkstra.

127
00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:36.375
Don't forget you're talking to a commoner.

128
00:08:36.458 --> 00:08:37.708
Hmm.

129
00:08:38.208 --> 00:08:41.708
Speaking plainly,
give us the girl before it's too late.

130
00:08:41.791 --> 00:08:43.125
No. Excuse me.

It means everything to us.

135
00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:03.125
Gods, I'm happy to see you.
I, uh, need a word.

136
00:09:14.916 --> 00:09:17.500
Tissaia mentioned
they were together as young mages.

137
00:09:20.291 --> 00:09:21.291
First love.

138
00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.333
Never goes away, does it?

139
00:09:27.208 --> 00:09:28.375
If you don't mind...

140
00:09:29.291 --> 00:09:30.416
No, not at all.

141
00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:34.416
Best of luck tomorrow
at the conclave, witcher.

142
00:09:48.208 --> 00:09:50.041
- Where have you been?
- What did Istredd say?

143
00:09:51.125 --> 00:09:55.166
- We don't have time for that.
- The Melange is about to begin!

144
00:09:57.291 --> 00:09:59.125
Come on, girl. Yes, yes, yes.

145
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.916
Yes!

146
00:10:02.583 --> 00:10:04.583
- Come on. Artaud!
- Keira.

147
00:10:04.666 --> 00:10:06.666
Yennefer.

148
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.166
Would you care...

149
00:10:08.791 --> 00:10:10.583
- Yes.
- Would you, my fair lady?

150
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.750
What's the Melange?

151
00:10:12.833 --> 00:10:13.833
It's a dance.

152
00:10:14.916 --> 00:10:16.000
It's not optional.

153
00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:25.708
Geralt.

154
00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:47.541
Are you enjoying your evening?

155
00:10:50.291 --> 00:10:51.291
Good.

156
00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:57.083
Oh, witcher!

157
00:10:57.166 --> 00:11:00.208
I've been waiting
to get my hands on you all evening.

158
00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:05.125
I studied as a contortionist, you know?
I'm quite bendy.

159
00:11:05.208 --> 00:11:07.750
I hope we can count on
your support tomorrow, Artorius.

160
00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:11.000
You might, Yennefer.
Although I've not forgotten your past.

161
00:11:11.083 --> 00:11:14.041
Nor the kings who are still waiting
on a particular princess.

162
00:11:14.125 --> 00:11:16.500
Of course,
but my priorities have changed.

163
00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:17.583
I'm here to help.

164
00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:21.416
We'll see. I've found trying to predict
the actions of Yennefer of Vengerberg

165
00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:24.083
as hopeless
as seeking a black cat in a coal cellar.

166
00:11:25.916 --> 00:11:27.333
They are worrisome.

167
00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:41.416
- Have you tried the wine yet?
- I'm not thirsty.

168
00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.500
Aww.

169
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:07.041
Geralt.

170
00:12:08.416 --> 00:12:09.416
Istredd.

171
00:12:11.083 --> 00:12:14.458
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the neck-breaking chaperone.

172
00:12:14.541 --> 00:12:17.333
I know. I owe you an apology.

173
00:12:17.416 --> 00:12:19.875
- Perhaps a drink later?
- I can't.

174
00:12:20.916 --> 00:12:23.041
I plan on getting pregnant tonight.

175
00:12:24.541 --> 00:12:26.958
Exciting times ahead, don't you think?

176
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.750
It's good to see you, Triss.

177
00:12:48.416 --> 00:12:49.500
You too.

178
00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:00.375
How is Ciri?

179
00:13:01.208 --> 00:13:03.208
She's safe. For now.

180
00:13:58.625 --> 00:13:59.666
Well played!

181
00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:01.291
Thank you.

182
00:14:05.958 --> 00:14:08.083
- That was marvelous.
- Thank you.

183
00:14:08.166 --> 00:14:09.166
Geralt.

184
00:14:09.666 --> 00:14:11.559
- I've never seen...
- Wonderful!

185
00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.309
- Exciting!
- Yes, well...

186
00:14:13.333 --> 00:14:16.083
Artaud, have you sampled
the wine this evening?

187
00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:19.000
- Ah, you know me too well.
- I think you're ready for another.

188
00:14:19.083 --> 00:14:22.166
You've been trying to win Yen
back all evening. Do you deny it?

189
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:24.083
Why the fuck would I deny it?

190
00:14:24.583 --> 00:14:26.458
- She knows I'm the better man!
- Ooh!

191
00:14:26.541 --> 00:14:27.833
Then prove it.

192
00:14:34.791 --> 00:14:36.000
Unbelievable.

193
00:14:40.125 --> 00:14:41.125
Coward.

194
00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.083
Whew!

195
00:15:03.083 --> 00:15:05.750
- Finally, some entertainment.
- The witcher is...

196
00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:08.500
I promised Yen
I wouldn't make a mess of this evening.

197
00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:09.833
Make a mess of him!

198
00:15:09.916 --> 00:15:11.583
So I won't.

199
00:15:13.166 --> 00:15:14.166
Truce?

200
00:15:14.625 --> 00:15:15.625
Oh shit!

201
00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:19.500
Who gave him champagne?

202
00:15:19.583 --> 00:15:21.416
Look at you!

203
00:15:23.083 --> 00:15:25.166
Artaud's wasted again!

204
00:15:30.791 --> 00:15:33.416
A fight was quite the creative choice.

205
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.666
Just admit that you loved it.

206
00:15:36.333 --> 00:15:40.041
As duels in my honor go, this one
certainly broke into the top three.

207
00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:41.541
Oh, well, it was an honor

208
00:15:41.625 --> 00:15:44.666
to fight for the capricious heart
of Yennefer of Vengerberg.

209
00:15:45.875 --> 00:15:49.000
And I hope to fight
many more battles with you, my dear.

210
00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:52.416
With me, or against me?

211
00:15:53.416 --> 00:15:54.583
Depends on the evening.

212
00:15:58.041 --> 00:15:59.750
I shouldn't like to lose you, Yen.

213
00:16:02.541 --> 00:16:03.875
But you have me.

214
00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:07.375
Tonight will end.

215
00:16:12.041 --> 00:16:13.208
Everything ends.

216
00:16:13.291 --> 00:16:16.833
And now, to bring
this wonderful evening to a close,

217
00:16:16.916 --> 00:16:18.583
a toast!

218
00:16:22.166 --> 00:16:25.500
To peace amongst mages of the North!

219
00:16:26.333 --> 00:16:29.000
To peace!

220
00:16:31.375 --> 00:16:33.791
There is much work to be done tomorrow.

221
00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:37.791
But Tissaia and I are optimistic
about the future of this Continent,

222
00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:40.041
based on what we've seen here tonight.

223
00:16:40.875 --> 00:16:42.000
To peace!

224
00:16:42.083 --> 00:16:43.666
To peace!

225
00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:50.708
And we have Yennefer of Vengerberg
to thank.

226
00:16:53.208 --> 00:16:54.416
Yennefer!

227
00:16:54.916 --> 00:16:56.250
Whoo! Brilliant.

228
00:17:00.833 --> 00:17:01.833
To us.

229
00:17:04.166 --> 00:17:06.416
And a nearly perfect evening.

230
00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.000
- ...everyone.
- That was good.

231
00:17:08.875 --> 00:17:10.125
So.

232
00:17:10.208 --> 00:17:11.125
Now what?

233
00:17:11.208 --> 00:17:12.291
Hmm.

234
00:17:12.791 --> 00:17:16.375
What a night indeed.

235
00:17:17.125 --> 00:17:19.000
I can't believe they bought it.

236
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.833
I thought our performance
was quite convincing.

237
00:17:21.916 --> 00:17:26.041
And a good thing, too. Philippa was
watching the whole ballroom like a hawk.

238
00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:28.125
She comes by it naturally.

239
00:17:28.208 --> 00:17:32.625
We weren't the only ones plotting tonight.
I could tell from the moment we entered.

240
00:17:33.208 --> 00:17:34.208
Hmm.

241
00:17:37.208 --> 00:17:38.833
Lilac and gooseberries.

242
00:17:38.916 --> 00:17:40.500
Now, that I can tolerate.

243
00:17:41.666 --> 00:17:42.958
Are you sure about this?

244
00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:45.500
Are you?

245
00:17:51.916 --> 00:17:53.583
...finding spell.

246
00:17:53.666 --> 00:17:55.083
- Just a courtesy.
- Hmm...

247
00:17:56.083 --> 00:17:57.833
Oh yes, here they are.

248
00:18:01.208 --> 00:18:04.166
I don't know which I'd like more,
to tear this costume off

249
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:07.000
or run Stregobor through
with the nearest ice sculpture.

250
00:18:07.083 --> 00:18:10.041
I know, and I hate the fucker
just as much as you do.

251
00:18:10.125 --> 00:18:11.958
But here,
we need to do things differently.

252
00:18:12.041 --> 00:18:13.916
The nearest serving fork, then.

253
00:18:14.625 --> 00:18:18.541
Or... rather than murder
an esteemed member of the Brotherhood

254
00:18:18.625 --> 00:18:20.125
in front of the entire North,

255
00:18:21.416 --> 00:18:22.416
we wait.

256
00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:24.833
We seek out proof tonight.

257
00:18:24.916 --> 00:18:27.541
We expose Stregobor
at the conclave tomorrow.

258
00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:29.958
He'll be put on trial.

259
00:18:30.541 --> 00:18:33.041
Until then, we have to play nicely

260
00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:35.833
if you-know-who's going to have
any kind of a future here.

261
00:18:36.458 --> 00:18:38.458
I saw what he did to those girls, Yen.

262
00:18:39.208 --> 00:18:41.666
I won't be leaving
until I know she's safe here.

263
00:18:42.541 --> 00:18:44.333
I hear you. But, Geralt...

264
00:18:45.791 --> 00:18:46.791
trust me.

265
00:18:48.083 --> 00:18:50.375
Mmm.

266
00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:07.916
The witcher!

267
00:19:10.333 --> 00:19:12.041
Is there always this much staring?

268
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.125
No. It's all for us.

269
00:19:15.791 --> 00:19:17.916
Get used to it.
They'll be watching us all night.

270
00:19:18.833 --> 00:19:20.166
Hmm. Good.

271
00:19:23.291 --> 00:19:24.583

272
00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:26.750

You know quite well
I make my killing catching secrets.

00:19:56.833 --> 00:19:58.458
- So Jaskier told me.

286
00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:09.833
By the way, Marti Sodergren put
an aphrodisiac in that wine hours ago.

287
00:20:09.916 --> 00:20:13.458
♪ A flower's sweetest bud... ♪

288
00:20:13.541 --> 00:20:15.125
- ♪ The lady's love... ♪
- Some caviar?

289
00:20:15.208 --> 00:20:18.041
Not to mention
the caviar on that plate is an illusion.

290
00:20:19.333 --> 00:20:22.291
Just like the rest
of this den of snobs and liars.

291
00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:24.416
Den of nymphomaniacs is more like it.

292
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.708
I suffered quite the greeting
from Sabrina Glevissig earlier.

293
00:20:28.791 --> 00:20:30.083
Hmm.

294
00:20:30.833 --> 00:20:33.833
What Sabrina showed you was child's play.

295
00:20:34.458 --> 00:20:35.458
Come.

296
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000

of one orgasm or more?

298
00:20:42.041 --> 00:20:43.416

299
00:20:45.291 --> 00:20:47.916
- You're keeping an eye on the witcher.
- Mm-hmm.

300
00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.791
You know, I was... sorry

301
00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:53.875
to hear of Codringher
and Fenn's fiery demise.

302
00:20:56.541 --> 00:20:57.458
Oh.

303
00:20:57.541 --> 00:21:00.583
I am surprised you haven't heard,

304
00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:04.125
since you've been
tracking the mage so diligently.

305
00:21:04.625 --> 00:21:05.875
You must mean Rience.

306
00:21:05.958 --> 00:21:08.434
- Wonderful!
- Do you think his master's here?

307
00:21:10.083 --> 00:21:11.583
Good attempt, Geralt.

308
00:21:12.416 --> 00:21:14.625
But I'm not as loose-lipped as some.

309
00:21:14.708 --> 00:21:16.416

- And yet you're here.

311
00:21:18.916 --> 00:21:20.916

312
00:21:20.958 --> 00:21:22.434
- ♪ As it seems... ♪
- Ahem.

313
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:28.416
You know, Philippa, I should scold you
for monopolizing the witcher's time.

314
00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.208
Geralt of Rivia, it is good
to have another non-magical brother here.

315
00:21:33.291 --> 00:21:35.916
- There's no room for error tonight.
- Tissaia...

316
00:21:37.708 --> 00:21:38.916
♪ All is not... ♪

317
00:21:39.583 --> 00:21:41.541
Trust in what you see.

318
00:21:41.625 --> 00:21:43.958
Give Yen at least a couple of hours
to piss everyone off.

319
00:21:44.041 --> 00:21:46.125
No promises.

320
00:21:48.416 --> 00:21:49.666
Speak of the devil.

321
00:21:50.625 --> 00:21:51.750
And she will appear.

322
00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:56.833
Philippa.

323
00:21:57.625 --> 00:21:58.625
Tissaia.

324
00:21:59.541 --> 00:22:00.541
Vilgefortz.

325
00:22:02.583 --> 00:22:04.458
And Yennefer of Vengerberg.

326
00:22:05.333 --> 00:22:07.291
What a pleasure to see you again.

327
00:22:07.916 --> 00:22:10.291
Care for a stroll? Alone.

328
00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:15.458
This conclave may
bring the mages together,

329
00:22:15.541 --> 00:22:17.333
but it can't change the inevitable.

330
00:22:17.416 --> 00:22:18.625
War is brewing.

331
00:22:18.708 --> 00:22:21.666
Not just across the Continent,
but here in Aretuza.

332
00:22:22.916 --> 00:22:26.333
There are traitors who will soon
turn their loyalty to Nilfgaard

333
00:22:26.416 --> 00:22:27.750
and not the North.

334
00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:30.958
One would be wise
to abandon neutrality and choose a side

335
00:22:31.041 --> 00:22:33.166
or risk losing everything.

336
00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.833
Redania is your only hope
of keeping the Lion Cub safe.

337
00:22:37.833 --> 00:22:42.166
Speak in simple terms, Dijkstra.
Remember you're talking to a commoner.

338
00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:46.291
Hmm. Speaking plainly,
give us the girl before it's too late.

339
00:22:46.375 --> 00:22:48.166
No. Excuse me.

340
00:22:49.333 --> 00:22:51.083
Fucking prick.

341
00:22:51.166 --> 00:22:52.416
You're staff.

342
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.750
- And you will conduct yourself as...
- ♪ All is not ♪

343
00:22:54.833 --> 00:22:56.291
♪ As it seems ♪

344
00:22:56.833 --> 00:22:58.166
- ♪ All is not... ♪
- Butcher.

345
00:22:58.708 --> 00:22:59.958
♪ As it seems ♪

346
00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.125
I wondered whether I'd see you again.

347
00:23:04.833 --> 00:23:07.375
I wondered if I'd see your head on a pike.

348
00:23:07.875 --> 00:23:09.291
I'm hurt, Geralt.

349
00:23:09.875 --> 00:23:13.500
After all, it wasn't me
who plunged my dagger into poor Renfri.

350
00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.750
I'll make you pay
for everything you've done.

351
00:23:17.625 --> 00:23:19.583
I'm saving the Continent.

352
00:23:20.416 --> 00:23:24.833
Rooting out the deadly creatures
that threaten us all, not unlike you.

353
00:23:26.666 --> 00:23:27.750
I am nothing

354
00:23:28.666 --> 00:23:29.708
like you.

355
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:32.375
Then show me, witcher.

356
00:23:34.041 --> 00:23:36.833
I want to see just how different we are.

357
00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:38.875
Hmm.

358
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.250
♪ All is not ♪

359
00:23:49.875 --> 00:23:51.375
♪ As it seems... ♪

360
00:23:51.875 --> 00:23:54.375
Thank you for coming tonight.
It means everything.

361
00:23:54.458 --> 00:23:56.708
My favorite song!

362
00:23:57.791 --> 00:24:00.250
Gods, I'm happy to see you.
I need a word.

363
00:24:00.333 --> 00:24:03.250
- What's going on?
- There's an artifact.

364
00:24:03.333 --> 00:24:06.083
The Book of Monoliths, ancient Elven text.

365
00:24:06.875 --> 00:24:08.083
Never heard of it.

366
00:24:08.166 --> 00:24:10.333
Not surprising.
They didn't teach it at Aretuza.

367
00:24:10.416 --> 00:24:13.750
But it gives the holder the ability
to travel through time and space.

368
00:24:13.833 --> 00:24:16.625
- How is that possible?
- I don't know. It should be impossible.

369
00:24:16.708 --> 00:24:20.833
But Triss and I traced the book here
and... Stregobor has it.

370
00:24:21.458 --> 00:24:23.125
And we know where he's hiding it.

371
00:24:23.625 --> 00:24:26.500
I told Istredd
about you being attacked in the illusion.

372
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:30.583
This is our chance, Yen.
We can get him for everything he's done.

373
00:24:30.666 --> 00:24:32.875
Someone needs to get
to his office, undetected...

374
00:24:32.958 --> 00:24:33.833
If you don't mind...

375
00:24:33.916 --> 00:24:36.291
- ...get the book before he uses it.
- Not at all.

376
00:24:36.375 --> 00:24:38.250
Best of luck tomorrow
at the conclave.

377
00:24:41.541 --> 00:24:43.375
It's my very favorite song.

378
00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:47.208
- Where have you been?
- What did Istredd say?

379
00:24:47.291 --> 00:24:49.625
We don't have time for that.

380
00:24:49.708 --> 00:24:51.500
Look, forget about what I said before.

381
00:24:51.583 --> 00:24:54.125
Stregobor has stolen
a very dangerous book,

382
00:24:54.208 --> 00:24:55.666
and he has plans for it.

383
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:56.750
And for Ciri.

384
00:24:56.833 --> 00:25:00.125
The Melange is about to begin!

385
00:25:00.833 --> 00:25:03.500
We need to figure it out
and nail him tonight.

386
00:25:06.458 --> 00:25:08.208
What's the Melange?

387
00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:09.291
It's a dance.

388
00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:10.833
It's not optional.

389
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.120
- Would you care to...
- Yes, of course!

390
00:25:17.291 --> 00:25:18.375
Even for me?

391
00:25:19.416 --> 00:25:20.416
Especially for you.

392
00:25:26.250 --> 00:25:27.250
Geralt.

393
00:25:45.875 --> 00:25:46.875
How is Ciri?

394
00:25:46.958 --> 00:25:48.958
She's safe. For now.

395
00:25:49.583 --> 00:25:51.743
What if someone could take away
what makes her special?

396
00:25:52.750 --> 00:25:56.041
Her powers are innate.
You know that better than most.

397
00:25:56.125 --> 00:25:58.583
What if she could have a chance
for a normal life?

398
00:25:58.666 --> 00:26:01.250
I don't know
what Ciri would consider normal.

399
00:26:02.166 --> 00:26:04.125
I just need her to survive this.

400
00:26:11.833 --> 00:26:13.958
We need to immobilize Stregobor.

401
00:26:16.791 --> 00:26:19.291
I'll create a distraction
so you can slip away.

402
00:26:31.666 --> 00:26:33.750
The signal will be "truce."

403
00:26:37.791 --> 00:26:40.083
I'll pass that on to Artaud.

404
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.708
We can do this. Good luck.

405
00:26:49.958 --> 00:26:50.958
What?

406
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:59.333
Geralt, I wanted to apologize.
Yen and I had important matters...

407
00:26:59.416 --> 00:27:00.750
- Follow my lead.
- Wh...

408
00:27:03.416 --> 00:27:06.625
You've been trying to win Yen back
all evening. Do you deny it?

409
00:27:08.083 --> 00:27:09.875
Why the fuck would I deny it?

410
00:27:10.833 --> 00:27:12.416
She knows I'm the better man!

411
00:27:13.458 --> 00:27:14.458
Prove it.

412
00:27:15.041 --> 00:27:16.041
Unbelievable.

413
00:28:06.041 --> 00:28:08.041
Oh... gods!

414
00:28:11.541 --> 00:28:13.500
- Now punch me.
- Oh, for...

415
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:21.000
Whew!

416
00:28:21.083 --> 00:28:22.458
Give him another.

417
00:28:23.625 --> 00:28:25.208
Go on.

418
00:28:26.458 --> 00:28:27.458
Truce?

419
00:28:27.875 --> 00:28:30.125
Oh shit!

420
00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.916
Artaud's wasted again!

421
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.416
I'll take that, half-breed!

422
00:28:59.833 --> 00:29:01.666
You don't belong here!

423
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.458
Hate to interrupt.

424
00:29:04.458 --> 00:29:06.208
Stregobor, you piece of shit.

425
00:29:06.791 --> 00:29:09.458
You never gave a damn
about unity, did you?

426
00:29:09.541 --> 00:29:13.125
Mere smoke and mirrors
to hide what you'd returned to do.

427
00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:14.833
Raze Aretuza to the ground.

428
00:29:16.125 --> 00:29:18.166
Your kind never changes.

429
00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:20.791
And yet, our feckless leaders
forgive and forgive.

430
00:29:20.875 --> 00:29:23.375
Well, mercy isn't my cup of tea.

431
00:29:23.458 --> 00:29:24.708
Nor mine.

432
00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:27.625
You've been hard at work, haven't you?

433
00:29:27.708 --> 00:29:30.750
Corrupting portals, kidnapping novices.

434
00:29:30.833 --> 00:29:32.875
Torturing those young women
to get to Ciri.

435
00:29:32.958 --> 00:29:35.208
This doesn't concern you, witcher.

436
00:29:35.291 --> 00:29:38.208
And I don't care two rat tails
about that Cintran brat.

437
00:29:38.291 --> 00:29:40.958
With any luck,
she lies dead in a ditch by now.

438
00:29:41.041 --> 00:29:43.875
That Cintran brat has more power
than you could dream of.

439
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.666
Or you could dream of. You have no idea
what you're dealing with here.

440
00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:51.833
The only threat you pose
is in your dirty blood.

441
00:29:51.916 --> 00:29:55.291
You're a monster who will soon
meet her reckoning. But the girl...

442
00:29:56.833 --> 00:30:00.791
The girl will most likely leave this world

443
00:30:00.875 --> 00:30:03.333
by your own mutant hands, Butcher.

444
00:30:03.416 --> 00:30:05.916
- I'll kill you myself.
- Stop!

445
00:30:07.958 --> 00:30:10.666
We came as soon as
we realized you were both gone.

446
00:30:12.041 --> 00:30:16.500
- Now would be the time to explain.
- Yes. Please, do.

447
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.250
Stregobor has been keeping
a list of elven students

448
00:30:21.333 --> 00:30:22.833
and their belongings.

449
00:30:22.916 --> 00:30:25.916
The ones who went missing
this month. Nissa.

450
00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:28.583
- Elisabet.
- Teryn.

451
00:30:29.166 --> 00:30:31.583
He's been conducting experiments.

452
00:30:31.666 --> 00:30:33.166
Practicing mind control.

453
00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.333
What? That's absurd!

454
00:30:35.416 --> 00:30:37.875
He tried to kill me
using a botched portal.

455
00:30:40.833 --> 00:30:43.083
Are you really gonna believe
a word she says?

456
00:30:43.166 --> 00:30:46.583
And we believe his ultimate aim
is set on Cirilla of Cintra.

457
00:30:48.291 --> 00:30:50.958
- You have proof of this?
- We do.

458
00:30:55.583 --> 00:30:57.503
What are you expecting
to find there?

459
00:31:12.208 --> 00:31:14.666
The Book of Monoliths.
An ancient elven tome.

460
00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:15.583
But...

461
00:31:15.666 --> 00:31:17.947
Rumored to contain knowledge
since before the Conjunction.

462
00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:18.875
But...

463
00:31:18.958 --> 00:31:21.791
This holds the key to how
the human sphere collided with the elves'.

464
00:31:21.875 --> 00:31:24.833
More importantly,
how humans could get rid of elves again.

465
00:31:25.458 --> 00:31:27.250
And you stole it. Didn't you?

466
00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:30.916
Do I want to rid these halls
of you and your ilk? Yes.

467
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.375
- But speculating that I...
- But nothing.

468
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:36.416
These are serious allegations.

469
00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:40.708
I propose Stregobor is held
until the conclave concludes

470
00:31:40.791 --> 00:31:42.750
and we can have a full trial.

471
00:31:42.833 --> 00:31:45.833
- I concur.
- Yes, of course you do.

472
00:31:45.916 --> 00:31:47.000
Artorius?

473
00:31:51.666 --> 00:31:55.250
You've turned against our own
in a time of unity, Stregobor.

474
00:31:56.166 --> 00:31:57.500
I cannot stand by you today.

475
00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:01.041
Get off me! You're deranged!

476
00:32:01.666 --> 00:32:02.666
All of you!

477
00:32:03.166 --> 00:32:05.125
A pack of lies!

478
00:32:05.208 --> 00:32:07.083
I'll hide this for safekeeping.

479
00:32:08.083 --> 00:32:10.708
Make sure it doesn't
fall into the wrong hands again.

480
00:32:17.708 --> 00:32:19.333
You've saved the night.

481
00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:22.041
And you too.

482
00:32:23.208 --> 00:32:25.041
Let's go and enjoy our party.

483
00:32:34.708 --> 00:32:36.166
She'll be missing this.

484
00:32:40.166 --> 00:32:41.208
I need a drink.

485
00:32:42.791 --> 00:32:44.125
Or twelve.

486
00:32:46.375 --> 00:32:47.375
A toast!

487
00:32:48.291 --> 00:32:51.541
To peace amongst mages of the North!

488
00:32:51.625 --> 00:32:54.291
To peace!

489
00:32:54.375 --> 00:32:55.250
Hmm.

490
00:32:55.333 --> 00:32:57.666
There is much work to be done tomorrow,

491
00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.541
but Tissaia and I are optimistic
about the future of the Continent,

492
00:33:01.625 --> 00:33:03.916
based on what we've seen here tonight.

493
00:33:04.833 --> 00:33:05.833
To peace!

494
00:33:05.875 --> 00:33:08.041
To peace!

495
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
And we have Yennefer of Vengerberg
to thank!

496
00:33:14.666 --> 00:33:16.750
To Yen!

497
00:33:17.958 --> 00:33:19.666
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

498
00:33:26.958 --> 00:33:27.958
To us.

499
00:33:29.166 --> 00:33:31.458
And a nearly perfect evening.

500
00:33:35.083 --> 00:33:36.166
I love you.

501
00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.250
That's the first time
you've ever said that.

502
00:33:45.541 --> 00:33:46.541
It can't be.

503
00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:48.500
You used to think it.

504
00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:51.500
But tonight, you actually said it.

505
00:33:56.333 --> 00:33:57.666
You can kiss me now.

506
00:33:59.666 --> 00:34:01.000
In front of everyone.

507
00:34:15.250 --> 00:34:17.458
It's our first
night out together.

508
00:34:18.166 --> 00:34:20.875
And all I can think about
is getting you alone.

509
00:34:30.041 --> 00:34:31.833
This I can also tolerate.

510
00:34:33.416 --> 00:34:36.041
It took far too long
to get you back in a bathtub.

511
00:34:40.375 --> 00:34:42.041
Did we actually pull it off?

512
00:34:42.125 --> 00:34:44.083
Hmm... It's hard to say.

513
00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:49.833
- Can't get Philippa out my head.
- How do you mean?

514
00:34:51.416 --> 00:34:53.416
When I visited her in Redania,

515
00:34:53.916 --> 00:34:55.750
she said I was one of them.

516
00:34:55.833 --> 00:34:58.666
But tonight,
it's like she wanted me on her side.

517
00:34:59.958 --> 00:35:02.250
- Her side of what?
- She didn't say.

518
00:35:05.125 --> 00:35:06.333
Tell me everything.

519
00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:09.000
Care for a stroll? Alone.

520
00:35:09.083 --> 00:35:12.250
♪ Her whisper dancing in my ear ♪

521
00:35:12.333 --> 00:35:14.666
- ♪ All is not as it seems... ♪
- Art!

522
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:16.041
- Tissaia.
- Margarita.

523
00:35:16.125 --> 00:35:17.976
- ♪ All is not... ♪
- Might make a beautiful...

524
00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.083
♪ As it seems... ♪

525
00:35:19.666 --> 00:35:23.083
I just live
for nights like this, don't you?

526
00:35:25.708 --> 00:35:28.500
If this is about Ciri,
you're not getting your hands on her.

527
00:35:28.583 --> 00:35:30.333
- Hmm!
- ♪ A flower's sweetest bud... ♪

528
00:35:30.416 --> 00:35:32.125
All in due time, Yen.

529
00:35:33.291 --> 00:35:36.583
But that is not why I pulled you away.

530
00:35:39.916 --> 00:35:41.833
Hmm. Poor thing.

531
00:35:42.541 --> 00:35:43.916
Lydia van Bredevoort?

532
00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.041
Mmm.

533
00:35:45.708 --> 00:35:47.875
Heartsick, I've recently learned.

534
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:50.208
She'd follow her lover anywhere,

535
00:35:50.291 --> 00:35:52.791
even blindly towards death,
if he asked it of her.

536
00:35:54.791 --> 00:35:56.666
I wondered if you knew the truth.

537
00:35:58.791 --> 00:36:00.666
What happened between Tissaia and I.

538
00:36:02.208 --> 00:36:06.125
Tissaia told me the friendship went cold.
She never shared the details.

539
00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:08.333
Oh.

540
00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:11.583
- Her loyalty is hard earned.
- ♪ All is not... ♪

541
00:36:11.666 --> 00:36:13.958
- And hard lost.
- ♪ As it seems ♪

542
00:36:14.041 --> 00:36:16.666
We only grew closer as the years went by.

543
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:19.541
Until the days
leading up to the First Northern War.

544
00:36:19.625 --> 00:36:20.500
Sodden?

545
00:36:22.041 --> 00:36:24.875
I tried to convince Tissaia not to go.

546
00:36:26.041 --> 00:36:28.000
Not to ally with Vilgefortz.

547
00:36:28.583 --> 00:36:32.166
To let the Continent fight their own
impossible battle. But she refused.

548
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.291
- And we won.
- But at what cost?

549
00:36:35.958 --> 00:36:39.333
They held on by a thread
until you tapped into fire magic.

550
00:36:40.416 --> 00:36:43.416
Too many mages were lost
by the time you began.

551
00:36:44.416 --> 00:36:46.125
And you lost too, didn't you?

552
00:36:46.208 --> 00:36:49.833
Tissaia wasn't just following Vilgefortz.

553
00:36:49.916 --> 00:36:51.791
She was fighting for the Brotherhood.

554
00:36:52.291 --> 00:36:54.333
The North, same as we're doing now.

555
00:36:54.416 --> 00:36:56.541
You're fighting on a sinking ship.

556
00:36:57.916 --> 00:37:01.208
The Brotherhood has no place
in the future of the Continent.

557
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.666
Tissaia has good intentions,

558
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:07.666
but her loyalty to this supposed home
will be her downfall.

559
00:37:08.458 --> 00:37:09.458
And mine too.

560
00:37:10.416 --> 00:37:14.541
Tell me, why did you come tonight,
if you're so certain Aretuza is doomed?

561
00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:19.250
Because you and I aren't like Tissaia.

562
00:37:20.916 --> 00:37:23.583
We break rules. We aren't afraid of power.

563
00:37:24.708 --> 00:37:26.208
There's still hope for you.

564
00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.458
Traitors are already working
with Nilfgaard.

565
00:37:29.541 --> 00:37:32.500
- As they always have been.
- Oh, see what you want to see.

566
00:37:33.666 --> 00:37:36.041
But if Tissaia and you stick to this plan,

567
00:37:36.541 --> 00:37:39.375
neither of you will be any better off
than poor Lydia.

568
00:37:40.166 --> 00:37:42.958
In love with a poison
that kills you slowly.

569
00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:45.500
Look, I hear you.

570
00:37:46.541 --> 00:37:47.541
I do.

571
00:37:47.583 --> 00:37:51.166
But Tissaia and I have weathered
our fair share of Brotherhood infighting.

572
00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:55.833
We will triumph tomorrow.
Just like we did at Sodden.

573
00:37:56.333 --> 00:37:59.666
And though I wish you'd have joined us
on the battlefield that day,

574
00:38:01.041 --> 00:38:02.791
we will fight without you again.

575
00:38:04.625 --> 00:38:07.875
When tomorrow's meetings unite the North,
I truly hope you can see

576
00:38:07.958 --> 00:38:10.416
that there are still
some things worth protecting.

577
00:38:13.041 --> 00:38:14.500
Thank you for coming tonight.

578
00:38:16.041 --> 00:38:17.125
It means everything.

579
00:38:21.083 --> 00:38:23.750
Tonight means everything to us as well.

580
00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.666
Maybe she just wanted
to stir up drama.

581
00:38:30.333 --> 00:38:31.833
Wouldn't be her first offense.

582
00:38:32.458 --> 00:38:34.750
It would explain Dijkstra's warning.

583
00:38:34.833 --> 00:38:36.791
They clearly know something we do not.

584
00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:39.666
But why wouldn't she speak up?

585
00:38:40.416 --> 00:38:43.416
Nothing we accused Stregobor of
had anything to do with Nilfgaard.

586
00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:46.041
And why the interest
in a mage who doesn't speak?

587
00:38:46.125 --> 00:38:47.250
I don't know.

588
00:38:48.666 --> 00:38:50.291
Why doesn't Lydia speak?

589
00:38:50.875 --> 00:38:53.625
Her lower jaw is an illusion.
A masterful one.

590
00:38:54.375 --> 00:38:58.125
She was wounded, horribly,
and now she can no longer speak aloud,

591
00:38:58.833 --> 00:39:00.708
only communicate telepathically.

592
00:39:01.458 --> 00:39:02.916
"The woman with the funny voice."

593
00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:05.958
- Hmm?
- Something Teryn said.

594
00:39:06.041 --> 00:39:08.833
- Do you still have Tissaia's bracelet?
- Somewhere here.

595
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.416
I passed Lydia
on the way to the Gallery of Glory.

596
00:39:17.291 --> 00:39:19.458
I think her earrings were made
of the same thing.

597
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:21.125
What were you doing up there?

598
00:39:21.208 --> 00:39:23.458
I went up
after I nearly murdered Stregobor.

599
00:39:23.541 --> 00:39:25.583
- After what?
- Nearly.

600
00:39:27.958 --> 00:39:30.083
I left him so I could get some peace.

601

607
00:39:47.416 --> 00:39:48.583
The First Landing.

608
00:39:49.458 --> 00:39:51.791
When Jan Bekker
bent the Power to his will.

609
00:39:53.291 --> 00:39:57.416
He calmed the waves, proving magic
need not be evil or destructive.

610
00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:01.583
Bekker formed what would henceforth
be known as the Brotherhood that day.

611
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:03.916
My favorite piece here.

612
00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.750
Outcasts, uniting under a common banner.

613
00:40:09.791 --> 00:40:10.875
An apt story.

614
00:40:12.291 --> 00:40:16.041
The only apt part is the pageant of events
I've witnessed this evening.

615
00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.125
It has indeed been worthy of a painting.

616
00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:22.416
It would be titled

617
00:40:23.375 --> 00:40:27.125
"Geralt Leaves the Isle of Thanedd,
Shaking with Laughter."

618
00:40:28.958 --> 00:40:34.083
Be that as it may, I'd hoped to find time
to speak with you this evening, Geralt.

619
00:40:34.875 --> 00:40:37.541
I'd wager we have more in common
than you realize.

620
00:40:38.666 --> 00:40:42.083
I doubt the parallels
between us are completely parallel.

621
00:40:42.166 --> 00:40:43.708
♪ As it seems... ♪

622
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.541
We're both outcasts ourselves.

623
00:40:55.541 --> 00:41:00.000
Like you, I cannot define myself
as mere man, mage, or druid.

624
00:41:02.583 --> 00:41:04.000
More than anything,

625
00:41:04.583 --> 00:41:05.625
I was an orphan.

626
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.500
Left to die in a gutter in Lan Exeter.

627
00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.250
I was bounced around this cruel world
by every monstrous creature imaginable.

628
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.208
Men, most of all.

629
00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:18.541
Until I became cruel myself.

630
00:41:19.875 --> 00:41:22.291
And rather than remain an unwanted mutant,

631
00:41:23.375 --> 00:41:25.375
I chose to become a sorcerer.

632
00:41:26.208 --> 00:41:27.208
Out of spite.

633
00:41:28.041 --> 00:41:29.625
Be careful, Vilgefortz.

634
00:41:30.333 --> 00:41:33.375
Careful that the similarities
you're so desperately searching for

635
00:41:33.458 --> 00:41:34.791
don't lead you too far.

636
00:41:34.875 --> 00:41:39.208
Oh, not to worry, witcher.
We have but one likeness that remains.

637
00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:43.666
I left that headstrong young boy behind
the day I fell in love with Tissaia.

638
00:41:43.750 --> 00:41:47.375
That bond,
that sense of family, changed me.

639
00:41:47.458 --> 00:41:51.166
And I know the same has happened to you
with Yennefer of Vengerberg.

640
00:41:54.166 --> 00:41:56.708
You seem to know a great many things.

641
00:41:56.791 --> 00:41:59.833
Then tell me
when I reach a mistruth.

642
00:42:00.708 --> 00:42:05.166
The longer Yennefer stays at Aretuza,
the stronger the Brotherhood will be.

643
00:42:05.916 --> 00:42:09.416
The more likely we'll be able to hold off
the powers that threaten the Continent.

644
00:42:11.166 --> 00:42:15.041
Have you... ever been attracted
by the art of sorcery, Geralt?

645
00:42:15.916 --> 00:42:18.125
- Hmm.
- Have you considered joining her here?

646
00:42:19.291 --> 00:42:21.625
If you want to protect what you love,

647
00:42:22.208 --> 00:42:24.166
join our side in the battle to come.

648
00:42:27.375 --> 00:42:29.375
The child will not remain safe for long,

649
00:42:29.458 --> 00:42:33.500
and your... passivity will be no weapon
with which to save her.

650
00:42:34.708 --> 00:42:38.375
It is incredible how much
my neutrality outrages everyone.

651
00:42:40.083 --> 00:42:43.125
How it subjects me
to offers of pacts and agreements

652
00:42:43.208 --> 00:42:46.125
and lectures
of the necessity of making a choice

653
00:42:46.208 --> 00:42:47.916
and joining the right side.

654
00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:52.083
I am not your equal partner in this game.

655
00:42:52.166 --> 00:42:54.708
So, no, I shall continue on my path.

656
00:42:55.875 --> 00:42:57.583
I shall respond to events.

657
00:42:57.666 --> 00:42:59.916
I'll adapt with the world as it changes.

658
00:43:00.708 --> 00:43:04.375
I understand, witcher.
But adapting may not be enough.

659
00:43:05.458 --> 00:43:08.166
Just know there is only one way
you do not lose her.

660
00:43:10.625 --> 00:43:12.416
And if I refuse to join your side?

661
00:43:15.625 --> 00:43:17.916
No matter where you go, what you do,

662
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:21.458
there will always be
enemies waiting for you.

663
00:43:28.375 --> 00:43:31.000
Tissaia mentioned
they were together as young mages.

664
00:43:33.083 --> 00:43:34.666
First love.

665
00:43:36.375 --> 00:43:37.791
Never goes away, does it?

666
00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.166
If you don't mind...

667
00:43:45.083 --> 00:43:46.208
No, not at all.

668
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:50.708
Best of luck tomorrow
at the conclave, witcher.

669
00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.375
"The battle to come"?

670
00:43:56.375 --> 00:43:58.833
Vilgefortz encouraged this conclave
to ensure peace.

671
00:44:00.708 --> 00:44:02.375
Maybe he didn't think it was possible.

672
00:44:05.291 --> 00:44:06.458
Scarlet ammonite.

673
00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:09.333
Rumored to protect loved ones.

674
00:44:09.416 --> 00:44:10.916
Or valuable property.

675
00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.458
Scarlet ammonite is only found
in the mines in West Redania.

676
00:44:16.333 --> 00:44:18.625
That's where I found
those girls locked in that castle.

677
00:44:18.708 --> 00:44:21.333
Geralt, the painting. The First Landing.

678
00:44:21.416 --> 00:44:23.958
It's where that corrupt portal took me
when I was attacked.

679
00:44:24.041 --> 00:44:26.250
There was a black mountain
with water below.

680
00:44:26.333 --> 00:44:27.875
It's Vilgefortz' favorite painting.

681
00:44:27.958 --> 00:44:31.583
He gave Tissaia that bracelet.
And I bet he gave Lydia that jewelry too.

682
00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:35.666
She's in love with him.

683
00:44:36.375 --> 00:44:38.166
"A poison that kills you slowly."

684
00:44:39.541 --> 00:44:41.958
- Stregobor wasn't our man.
- Vilgefortz is.

685
00:44:45.791 --> 00:44:47.711
- What are you doing?
- Trying to locate Tissaia.

686
00:44:47.791 --> 00:44:50.541
- If she's in danger, I need to know.
- We don't have time.

687
00:44:50.625 --> 00:44:53.833
I'm not leaving her.
Make sure the path is clear.

688
00:45:15.208 --> 00:45:16.916
Secure the Great Hall!

689
00:45:17.958 --> 00:45:19.875
Go! Put a man there!

690
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:31.625
Should have chosen a side, witcher.
