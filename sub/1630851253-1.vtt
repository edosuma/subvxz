are hundreds of years old and just bones.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.166
Hi, Littlefoot.

16:29.250 --> 16:32.291
Everything is exactly
where I want it to be at 20 weeks.

16:33.250 --> 16:36.041
-Have you had any spotting recently?
-No.

16:37.708 --> 16:38.750
Why?

16:38.833 --> 16:40.750
-There's a little bleed in there.
-Oh, God.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.708
I'm not worried about it.
It's very small. We'll keep an eye on it.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.708
[sighs] I guess he's home.

16:54.750 --> 16:55.833
Poor woman.

16:58.541 --> 17:01.041
Peggy? Is that you, Peg?

17:01.125 --> 17:04.041
-Oh, my God, Ma. What are you doing?
-Peggy.

17:04.625 --> 17:07.916
No, Ma. That's Erin.
Peggy's daughter, Erin Greene.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.375
-Do you remember Erin Greene?
-Hi, Mrs. Gunning.

17:11.041 --> 17:12.208
Oh.

17:12.750 --> 17:13.791
[hesitates]

17:13.875 --> 17:17.041
I think you've put me in the wrong room.

17:18.291 --> 17:20.041
My room is upstairs.

17:20.125 --> 17:22.791
[Sarah] No, Ma. No more stairs.
Not for a year now.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.125
Not since you broke your hip.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.208
[whimpers]

17:30.291 --> 17:32.375
[Hassan] Hey. Good boy.

17:32.458 --> 17:36.000
-[Annie] Morning, Sheriff.
-Hey. Morning, Annie.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.541
I'll be in a little later this morning.
I switched my shift.

17:38.625 --> 17:42.458
[Hassan] Oh. Take your time.
Yeah, this must be your son. Riley, is it?

18:01.708 --> 18:04.333
-Rise and shine, Joe.
-Oh, shit.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.291
-[coughing]
-You want some coffee?

18:11.750 --> 18:14.208
-What did you do to me, Sharif?
-Sheriff.

18:14.916 --> 18:18.041
I'm surprised you're surprised.
I figured this is where you wanted to be.

18:18.125 --> 18:19.791
You were trying to break in, after all.

18:19.875 --> 18:22.166
Well, into the general store anyway.

18:22.250 --> 18:24.583
Half past midnight
and sweating pure Jim Beam.

18:24.666 --> 18:25.958
Havin' at the windows with an oar.

18:26.041 --> 18:28.875
We'd still be sweepin' up glass
if your aim had been any good.

18:28.958 --> 18:30.458
So you lock me up?

18:35.666 --> 18:39.333
Well, Joe, I learned early there's
no point trying to stop you drinking.

18:39.416 --> 18:42.916
Yeah, easy for you to say.
Allah doesn't let you drink.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.000
You said you were being followed
by a giant albatross.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.750
-Huh?
-Oh, yeah.

18:47.833 --> 18:50.708
[imitates Joe] "Wings as big
as lawn chairs," you said.

18:52.208 --> 18:59.083
Well… that makes a little sense,
actually, because albatross is bad luck.

18:59.875 --> 19:02.958
You'd know that if you was a fisherman.

19:03.041 --> 19:04.250
[barking]

19:06.458 --> 19:08.000
[chuckling] Whoa.

19:08.083 --> 19:10.541
Easy, big fella. Easy. Hello.

19:10.625 --> 19:14.750
Snapped at me.
Snapped right at me, just passing by.

19:14.833 --> 19:15.833
Pike didn't snap.

19:15.916 --> 19:19.500
Barks sometimes. Mostly just to say hello.

19:19.583 --> 19:22.791
He's just big is all.
He just sounds bigger than he means to.

19:22.875 --> 19:26.583
Snapped. Thought he might
have a go at my hand if I reached out.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.333
I'm telling you, Sheriff, it's a menace.

19:29.416 --> 19:31.666
I'm sorry, Miss Keane.
He's just waiting for his dad.

19:31.750 --> 19:33.250
Speaking of a menace.

19:33.333 --> 19:36.625
Hey, what's that, Beverly?
You wanna speak up?

19:38.250 --> 19:43.333
Yeah, you just ignore her, buddy.
She's just mean. She's just a meanie.

19:43.416 --> 19:46.125
I'm sorry for the hassle. I mean it.

19:46.208 --> 19:48.458
Can't be what you pictured
when you took this job,

19:48.541 --> 19:50.208
dealing with me all the time.

19:50.291 --> 19:53.375
Ah, it might bother me
if I gave you much thought.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.083
[laughs]

19:56.083 --> 19:57.583
[clicks tongue] Come on, buddy.

19:58.625 --> 20:00.000
Later, Sharif.

20:01.458 --> 20:02.583
Take care, Joe.

20:05.083 --> 20:06.083
See you soon.

20:08.416 --> 20:09.750
[Annie sighs]

20:09.833 --> 20:13.333
Yeah, the Millers went last year.

20:14.458 --> 20:15.958
They didn't even list.

20:17.250 --> 20:21.708
I don't think anyone's
trying to sell anymore. They just left.

20:23.916 --> 20:26.041
Frank's got a job in Oregon now.

20:27.333 --> 20:28.291
Factory job.

20:31.333 --> 20:35.000
Oh. Welcome home, honey. Welcome home.

20:36.833 --> 20:37.750
[Annie sighs]

20:45.375 --> 20:46.416
You comin'?

20:46.500 --> 20:48.458
[objects clattering]

20:57.458 --> 21:01.375
Sorry. Your dad's been using this
to store some stuff in.

21:01.458 --> 21:04.666
Don't have room for it
anywhere else. Sorry.

21:06.625 --> 21:09.833
-He really didn't show up.
-Don't look at it like that.

21:09.916 --> 21:13.125
You're home now.
He's treatin' you normal. That's all.

21:13.625 --> 21:15.458
You don't know what it's like these days.

21:15.541 --> 21:19.041
You can only fish certain spots,
certain days, crab certain spots,

21:19.666 --> 21:20.708
since the spill.

21:20.791 --> 21:25.041
Three years since the spill,
yeah, which was bad enough.

21:25.125 --> 21:28.041
God only knows. I mean, you couldn't
eat anything out of that water.

21:28.125 --> 21:31.125
Your father smelled like diesel
every day he came home,

21:31.208 --> 21:33.416
even after they said
it was all cleaned up.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.833
I mean, I thought
the environmentalists were on our side.

21:38.416 --> 21:43.625
These limits, these retention limits,
going on about population decline,

21:43.708 --> 21:45.125
and suddenly, there's a limit.

21:45.208 --> 21:48.208
But not for the oil company,
for us. For the boats.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.291
We can only catch as much as they say?

21:51.375 --> 21:54.833
But they've never been watermen.
Never worked these waters.

21:55.500 --> 21:57.750
I mean, you want to talk
population decline,

21:57.833 --> 21:59.708
let's talk about the people.

21:59.791 --> 22:03.416
The people on this island,
we used to be hundreds.

22:04.875 --> 22:06.208
Now we're just dozens.

22:08.958 --> 22:11.000
This isn't a community anymore, honey.

22:11.708 --> 22:12.750
It's a ghost.

22:14.375 --> 22:18.625
-He'd be here if he could.
-Sure, Mom.

22:21.916 --> 22:24.500
I figured this is
the first time Sheriff Hassan

22:24.583 --> 22:26.500
has been with us for a storm like this,

22:26.583 --> 22:28.833
and I thought
we could all use a refresher.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.416
Thank you, Mayor.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.666
Um, still looking like
it'll hit us right in the face.

22:32.750 --> 22:34.833
Weather services are calling it
a major storm,

22:34.916 --> 22:37.458
forecasting to have
the worst of it landing tomorrow night.

22:37.541 --> 22:39.750
Assuming it does hit
and hits like they say,

22:39.833 --> 22:42.708
the biggest thing I wanted to talk about
was our fuel supply.

22:42.791 --> 22:43.625
Sturge?

22:43.708 --> 22:46.541
Yeah, I'll make sure
the pumps are off, as usual.

22:46.625 --> 22:48.083
Uh, just before sundown

22:48.166 --> 22:50.833
so that the, uh, watermen can fuel up
after the catch.

22:51.416 --> 22:53.375
And I'm assuming
you'll cut the power to the marina?

22:53.458 --> 22:56.208
-Oh, we'll likely lose power anyways.
-Oh, yeah.

22:56.291 --> 22:59.958
Then I'm thinking we make the classrooms
available here for shelters if we need.

23:00.041 --> 23:02.250
-We could always--
-I'm sorry. [chuckles]

23:02.333 --> 23:05.166
You're new, so you wouldn't
be expected to know this,

23:05.250 --> 23:07.041
but St. Patrick's is always the shelter.

23:07.125 --> 23:09.958
We set out cots
as a matter of rule, always have.

23:10.041 --> 23:13.208
Now… Well, now,
we have the new rec center.

23:13.291 --> 23:17.666
It's not completely done,
but close, and it holds twice as many.

23:17.750 --> 23:22.166
I mean, I'm not sure holding
twice as many makes a material difference.

23:22.250 --> 23:23.666
When you do the math, you…

23:26.000 --> 23:29.000
-Apologies, Miss Keane. I wasn't aware.
-[Bev] No need to apologize.

23:29.958 --> 23:31.666
You'd have no reason to know that.

23:31.750 --> 23:32.583
All right, um--

23:32.666 --> 23:34.750
Bear it in mind for yourself as well,

23:34.833 --> 23:37.625
unless you plan
on hopping a ferry to the mosque,

23:37.708 --> 23:39.666
you'll have to hunker down with us too.

23:39.750 --> 23:41.333
And you'd be so welcome, of course.

23:41.958 --> 23:43.625
[smacks lips] Thank you.

23:44.250 --> 23:47.791
Uh, we'll let everybody know to head
to St. Patrick's if things get bad.

23:47.875 --> 23:49.416
[chuckling] They know that.

23:49.500 --> 23:53.500
Understood. Uh, now, let's talk boats.
Securing the marina for starters.

24:00.833 --> 24:02.208
[wind chimes clanging]

24:08.000 --> 24:09.958
How often do you have to go
to the mainland?

24:11.625 --> 24:12.958
Once a week.

24:13.041 --> 24:14.625
Warren, eat your food.

24:14.708 --> 24:18.166
Uh, it's fine. It's, um… AA meetings.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.375
Part of the deal. Condition of my parole.

24:20.458 --> 24:21.750
[Annie] Warren.

24:21.833 --> 24:24.000
How was your day? How was school?

24:24.083 --> 24:27.791
It was good.
Miss Greene was mostly on about the storm.

24:27.875 --> 24:30.208
Miss Greene?
That old bird's still teaching?

24:30.291 --> 24:33.541
Nah, the old Miss Greene died
in the spring.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.916
This is the new Miss Greene, her daughter.

24:37.791 --> 24:38.916
-Erin's back?
-[Annie] Mmm-hmm.

24:39.750 --> 24:42.708
I meant to tell you about that.
She's only been back a few months.

24:42.791 --> 24:45.333
She moved into Peggy's house.
Her old job too.

24:45.416 --> 24:46.875
I don't know how long she's staying,

24:46.958 --> 24:49.250
but it was so nice
to have someone move to the island.

24:49.333 --> 24:51.541
-And a young person at that.
-[Riley] Um…

24:51.625 --> 24:54.125
Where is she back from?
What was she doing?

24:54.208 --> 24:55.750
Mmm, I suppose you'd have to ask her.

24:56.875 --> 24:58.500
We know one thing she was doing.

24:58.583 --> 25:00.166
-Warren.
-What? She told us herself.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.958
Besides, she's starting to show,

25:02.041 --> 25:04.291
so if it was a secret,
it's not going to be for long.

25:04.375 --> 25:06.208
[Annie] Whatever happened
when she ran away,

25:06.291 --> 25:09.333
she has grown into
a fine young woman and a fine teacher,

25:09.416 --> 25:11.375
and we're lucky that she's back.

25:11.458 --> 25:13.625
Prodigal daughter.
You'll see her tomorrow, in fact.

25:14.208 --> 25:15.833
She sits in the starboard side,
halfway back,

25:15.916 --> 25:17.041
just like her mother, every week.

25:17.125 --> 25:19.375
-Tomorrow?
-[Annie] At church.

25:21.291 --> 25:25.458
I wasn't… planning on going to church.

25:26.625 --> 25:29.541
[Annie chuckling] Don't be silly.
Of course you are.

25:30.166 --> 25:34.583
No, things have changed for me, Ma.
I'm not… That's not me anymore.

25:36.333 --> 25:41.458
Well, see, Monsignor Pruitt said,
before he went on pilgrimage. He said--

25:41.541 --> 25:44.625
Isn't he a little bit old to be traveling?
He's gonna be 80 now.

25:44.708 --> 25:46.958
Mmm, well,
the whole congregation pitched in.

25:47.583 --> 25:49.708
-Two weeks in the Holy Land.
-Jesus.

25:49.791 --> 25:52.541
He spent his whole life on the island,

25:52.625 --> 25:56.083
and the chance to walk in
Jesus' footsteps, in his actual footsteps.

25:56.166 --> 25:58.500
-[Riley] Yeah.
-We thought he deserved that before--

25:58.583 --> 26:01.083
I'm surprised they let him go,
though, considering his health.

26:01.166 --> 26:03.291
You should be so lucky
to be as fit as him at his age.

26:03.375 --> 26:04.500
He's losing it.

26:04.583 --> 26:07.250
He held up the host three times
during Consecration the other day.

26:07.333 --> 26:10.125
-I felt ridiculous ringing the bell.
-[Annie] We all have our moments.

26:10.208 --> 26:12.791
[Warren] People have been seeing him
wandering around at night,

26:12.875 --> 26:14.083
like late at night.

26:14.166 --> 26:18.041
Like, midnight. At the marina,
the docks, the general store.

26:18.125 --> 26:20.708
Did you see him, Warren?
Do you know it was him?

26:20.791 --> 26:22.916
No, I'm sure it was
some other 80-year-old man

26:23.000 --> 26:25.416
wearing a fedora
and the long coat he always wears.

26:25.500 --> 26:28.791
[Annie] Even if he was getting
a little bit scattered,

26:28.875 --> 26:31.750
he belongs here on the island with us.

26:31.833 --> 26:35.166
Not in some home,
put out to pasture by the archdiocese.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.375
Who knows who they'd send in his place?

26:37.958 --> 26:40.083
So if we do cover for him, just a little--

26:40.166 --> 26:42.458
We're practically steering him
around the altar half the time.

26:42.541 --> 26:43.583
That is not true.

26:43.666 --> 26:46.458
[chuckles] Come on.
You can't fool the altar boys.

26:46.541 --> 26:49.250
-You a thurifer?
-That's right.

26:49.333 --> 26:52.250
I never had any ambitions
past acolyte myself.

26:52.333 --> 26:54.916
No one likes
a downwardly mobile altar boy.

26:55.000 --> 26:56.750
I was really only in it for the chicks.

26:56.833 --> 26:58.541
-[chuckles]
-You know, man in uniform.

26:58.625 --> 27:00.250
-[Warren] Mmm-hmm.
-[chuckles]

27:01.041 --> 27:02.000
It's not funny.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.708
It's not funny at all.

27:08.375 --> 27:11.833
You're gonna sit here
at this table, after what you…

27:13.541 --> 27:15.083
After what you've done,

27:16.833 --> 27:18.833
and say, "Oh, church isn't for me"?

27:20.333 --> 27:24.958
And make jokes
about altar boys and Monsignor Pruitt?

27:27.041 --> 27:29.250
Mmm-mmm. No. Nope.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.083
You are going to church tomorrow, Riley.

27:33.166 --> 27:35.291
-Dad--
-And every other Sunday.

27:37.041 --> 27:41.166
I don't care if your heart's not in it
or the mood doesn't strike you.

27:41.750 --> 27:44.083
You can consider it
a condition of your parole.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.041
Monsignor!

28:16.041 --> 28:17.541
Monsignor!

28:23.583 --> 28:27.083
Monsignor, you are home. Welcome back.

28:28.125 --> 28:32.583
I'm so relieved you're okay.
I waited for you this morning.

28:33.166 --> 28:36.000
You weren't on the Breeze like we agreed.

28:36.625 --> 28:39.250
I'm sure you just forgot, had one of your…

28:39.958 --> 28:43.250
Still, you have no idea
how it makes me look,

28:43.333 --> 28:47.666
standing there on the dock
like some jilted prom date.

28:47.750 --> 28:51.500

44:44.541 --> 44:47.500
There's a lot of time
to read in there and I read it all,

44:47.583 --> 44:52.041
Torah, Quran, Talmud, Tao Te Ching.

44:52.750 --> 44:56.125
Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, Jainism.

44:57.416 --> 45:00.166
Figured if I was lookin' for God,
I should look everywhere.

45:02.291 --> 45:03.750
Came out of that an atheist.

45:04.541 --> 45:05.541
What?

45:06.125 --> 45:09.458
I'm supposed to be the godless heathen,
and you are the altar boy.

45:09.541 --> 45:11.375
My mom wouldn't believe any of this.

45:12.916 --> 45:14.250
And you're pregnant.

45:15.791 --> 45:17.041
Yeah, I am.

45:20.541 --> 45:21.541
Bet that's a story.

45:23.458 --> 45:24.625
It is and it isn't.

45:26.375 --> 45:27.750
Littlefoot saved my life.

45:37.333 --> 45:40.291
Is there anything else
you need this afternoon, Father?

45:40.375 --> 45:41.916
For the storm or…

45:42.000 --> 45:44.458
Oh. No. No, thank you, Miss Keane.

45:46.958 --> 45:48.333
Can I ask you something?

45:49.250 --> 45:50.958
Forgive me, I don't mean to…

45:52.041 --> 45:54.916
It's just you're wearing
a gold chasuble today.

45:56.583 --> 45:57.916
Uh, yes, I am.

45:58.625 --> 46:01.791
Isn't that for feast days and special…

46:02.708 --> 46:05.083
Shouldn't it be green today?

46:06.041 --> 46:10.541
We're in Ordinary Time.
It's the seventh Sunday of Ordinary Time.

46:11.750 --> 46:15.666
No, I'm afraid I wasn't able
to locate the green chasuble this morning.

46:15.750 --> 46:18.000
Perhaps Monsignor Pruitt,

46:18.083 --> 46:22.291
he stored it somewhere unusual
given his mental state before he left.

46:23.041 --> 46:25.916
I just figured
this was better than my pajamas.

46:26.000 --> 46:27.041
[chuckles]

46:27.125 --> 46:30.541
Honestly, I didn't expect
that anyone would notice.

46:30.625 --> 46:33.333
Well, in the future,
let me know if there's an issue.

46:33.416 --> 46:37.208
That's what I'm here for.
I can order more as well.

46:37.291 --> 46:41.916
I'm sure I'll find it. I just need
some time to open up all the cabinets.

46:42.583 --> 46:43.583
Of course.

46:45.208 --> 46:46.416
This was excellent.

46:47.416 --> 46:50.625
Have a good afternoon, Father.
I'm glad you're here.

46:50.708 --> 46:52.250
Oh, thank you.

46:52.750 --> 46:53.833
And likewise.

46:58.333 --> 47:01.625
[Riley] Must be weird,
I mean, living there with her gone?

47:02.250 --> 47:05.625
[Erin] It's a lot better than
when she was here. You at home?

47:06.791 --> 47:07.666
[Riley] Oh, yeah.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.375
[Erin] That's gotta feel weird.

47:11.250 --> 47:15.041
-Tiny room, twin bed.
-Actually, I'm kinda used to that.

47:16.708 --> 47:22.791
So, I mean, you came back… here.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.583
Like, you came back here on purpose.

47:27.875 --> 47:28.875
Why?

47:33.333 --> 47:34.375
How are you, Riley?

47:37.208 --> 47:38.125
Hangin' in.

47:38.208 --> 47:41.416
No, I mean, how are you?

47:48.416 --> 47:49.500
I don't know.

47:51.125 --> 47:52.166
That's kinda…

47:54.291 --> 47:57.166
That's kinda the whole thing.
I don't know. I have no idea.

47:58.875 --> 48:01.791
I mean, in prison, it was easy.
I had things to do, you know.

48:01.875 --> 48:04.833
Count the days,
count down the sentence, eat, sleep, read.

48:04.916 --> 48:10.208
It's all pretty carefully spelled out
for you. Regimented. But here…

48:12.416 --> 48:13.500
Here…

48:16.833 --> 48:17.833
[chuckles softly]

48:18.875 --> 48:19.875
I have nothing.

48:21.125 --> 48:22.750
What, am I gonna get a job?

48:23.958 --> 48:26.791
Go to school?
I have no money, no prospects, I just…

48:33.541 --> 48:36.375
I just exist now.

48:39.291 --> 48:40.458
That's it. I have…

48:42.500 --> 48:45.083
absolutely no purpose at all.

48:50.000 --> 48:52.875
I'm just sitting
in my parents' house, breathing,

48:54.583 --> 48:57.833
and serving no purpose
to anyone whatsoever. I'm just…

49:02.291 --> 49:03.250
living.

49:07.041 --> 49:10.291
And that's the worst part,
because I shouldn't be alive, Erin.

49:16.125 --> 49:16.958
So I don't know.

49:19.625 --> 49:20.791
What I do here.

49:21.416 --> 49:23.250
I eat. Sleep.

49:25.041 --> 49:26.750
Shit, I don't know.

49:29.125 --> 49:32.333
Walk home now, eat dinner,
wait out this fuckin' storm.

49:32.416 --> 49:33.791
There you go.

49:35.208 --> 49:36.125
Do that.

49:36.875 --> 49:39.208
Ride out the storm tonight,
and then tomorrow…

49:42.083 --> 49:45.250
you'll see what tomorrow's all about.
Find another project.

49:49.625 --> 49:50.666
I'm sorry.

49:53.458 --> 49:55.041
For what you've been through.

49:57.208 --> 49:58.750
I'm really, really sorry.

50:12.416 --> 50:13.333
[sighs]

50:14.000 --> 50:15.208
[door opens, closes]

50:41.166 --> 50:42.166
[Annie] So it's just…

50:42.833 --> 50:44.666
Just this one. Just the big one.

50:44.750 --> 50:47.500
The little ones I can replace,
but just this one.

50:49.583 --> 50:51.458
Yeah. Okay.

51:28.208 --> 51:29.458
[thunderclap]

51:32.375 --> 51:33.750
[wind howling]

51:46.083 --> 51:47.750
[thunder rumbling]

52:01.333 --> 52:04.291
-[Mildred] What's happening?
-[Sarah] Mom, it's okay.

52:25.583 --> 52:27.750
[Riley] I swear he's out there,
just walking on the beach.

52:27.833 --> 52:30.000
What? No, he's on the mainland.

52:30.083 --> 52:31.375
[Riley] Okay, maybe he came back,

52:31.458 --> 52:34.000
and he wandered out,
having one of those spells.

52:34.083 --> 52:36.458
-I'm not seeing anything.
-I don't see him.

52:36.541 --> 52:39.583
No, I swear, it's the hat, the coat.
I know the outfit, and it's him.

52:39.666 --> 52:41.208
No, he's on the mainland.

52:42.458 --> 52:43.500
It's Pruitt!

52:43.583 --> 52:46.125
Honey, my eyes aren't
what they used to be, so I can't…

52:54.875 --> 52:55.875
[Riley] Father Pruitt!

52:57.833 --> 52:59.041
Monsignor!

53:02.750 --> 53:05.541
Monsignor! Monsignor!

53:14.791 --> 53:15.791
Father!

53:45.375 --> 53:46.791
[birds screeching]

53:57.041 --> 53:58.250
[Annie] The phones are still down.

53:59.750 --> 54:03.041
We should just walk
to the rectory and settle this.

54:03.125 --> 54:04.791
Make sure he's okay.

54:04.875 --> 54:07.041
I have to check on the boat anyway.

54:07.125 --> 54:08.708
[screeching continues]

54:53.541 --> 54:55.958
Dad. What is that?

55:07.416 --> 55:09.416
[sinister music playing]

55:41.666 --> 55:43.041
[screeching]

55:52.541 --> 55:54.541
-[waves crashing]
-[seagulls screeching]
