Can you put the blow-up bed
back in our room, please?

00:31.775 --> 00:33.615
But we're gonna be using it again tonight.

00:33.695 --> 00:34.775
And?

00:37.735 --> 00:39.015
Can we get you anything, Will?

00:40.095 --> 00:42.095
Oh, I'll have a cranberry juice, Becca.

00:42.175 --> 00:43.535
Yeah, of course.
Get Will a cranberry juice.

00:44.095 --> 00:46.335
- Well, can't you get it?
- And tidy up this pigsty.

00:47.055 --> 00:48.295
You've just told me to do this.

00:48.375 --> 00:49.695
Get the drink on the way back!

00:51.775 --> 00:53.655
No, not there.
Can you put it back in the box?

00:55.775 --> 00:57.295
Pop it on the table, dude.

00:59.415 --> 01:00.455
Fuck you.

Subtitles by explosiveskull

01:12.415 --> 01:15.535
You couldn't make me one of those,
could you, darling?

01:15.615 --> 01:16.655
What, a fruit smoothie?

01:16.735 --> 01:20.055
Yes. I've been thinking about
getting back on track

01:20.135 --> 01:22.775
- with my old fitness levels, you know?
- Here, have mine.

01:22.855 --> 01:24.055
Oh, thank you.

01:26.135 --> 01:28.695
Mmm! I feel thinner already.

01:28.775 --> 01:30.415
I'll get it.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.055
- Oh, Sherry.
- Something's come up.

01:36.135 --> 01:39.095
They've called an emergency meeting
at We Cover. I'll fill you in on the way.

01:39.175 --> 01:41.175
Right. Need to get a few bits and bobs.

01:41.255 --> 01:42.775
Iain, you've got a little...

01:42.855 --> 01:45.015
- something in your whiskers.
- Oh, right.

01:45.415 --> 01:46.855
Oh!

01:47.575 --> 01:50.295
Mmm, mmm! Just a bit of smoothie.

01:52.175 --> 01:54.655
Boiled egg? I can pop one in.

01:55.295 --> 01:57.335
No, no, I'm good.

01:57.415 --> 01:58.575
Did you manage to book the flight?

01:59.655 --> 02:01.175
I'll start looking today.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.775
Right. Didn't you have, like, a wedding?

02:03.855 --> 02:06.215
- Becca, boiled egg?
- Oh, yeah, lovely, ta.

02:11.735 --> 02:13.375
It's Michael from We Cover.

02:13.455 --> 02:14.455
What does he want?

02:14.535 --> 02:16.975
He wants to drive me to work.

02:17.055 --> 02:19.135
- Ooh, can I come?
- Oh, sorry, man.

02:19.215 --> 02:20.855
They're a bit funny about...

02:21.735 --> 02:23.175
bringing guests in.

02:23.255 --> 02:24.895
Oh. Okay.

02:25.175 --> 02:26.415
Good luck booking the flight.

02:33.775 --> 02:35.135
Kenny's dead?

02:36.335 --> 02:38.695
It's that image of him
I can't get out of my mind.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.175
Horrible!

02:41.575 --> 02:42.695
Horrible.

02:42.775 --> 02:44.895
How the hell did he die, Michael?

02:47.415 --> 02:48.655
Suicide.

02:49.775 --> 02:50.935
Kenny West...

02:52.655 --> 02:53.855
dead.

02:57.415 --> 02:59.055
Kenny West, dead.

02:59.135 --> 03:00.615
Well, I can't say I'm surprised.

03:00.695 --> 03:03.095
Always bringing prostitutes
back to the club,

03:03.175 --> 03:04.615
inviting me and Mrs. S over for...

03:05.495 --> 03:08.655
well, God knows what.
Anyway, the incoming CEO

03:08.735 --> 03:11.015
wants to meet with
all the preferred clinic chiefs

03:11.095 --> 03:14.015
and St. Frederick's
is top of the heap because of...

03:15.295 --> 03:17.495
Oh, because of...?

03:17.575 --> 03:19.415
You! Your patient, Daniel Glass.

03:19.495 --> 03:22.695
We get preferential treatment
because of your hard work, Iain.

03:22.775 --> 03:25.135
Right, so I'm in the good books, am I?

03:25.215 --> 03:27.135
Iain, you're an absolute hero.

03:27.215 --> 03:29.295
- Oh.
- I can't thank you enough.

03:30.535 --> 03:32.615
Oh... it's just smoothie.

03:35.095 --> 03:37.335
What say after all this
we take the afternoon off

03:37.415 --> 03:38.975
and go and whack a few tennis balls?

03:39.055 --> 03:42.015
If our ladies are free,
we could make it mixed doubles, eh?

03:42.615 --> 03:45.215
Yes. Yes, that would be wonderful.

03:46.335 --> 03:47.535
Coming, Sherry.

03:47.615 --> 03:49.055
Here they come!

03:50.655 --> 03:53.815
Out of the way, please. This man
has a life-threatening condition.

03:53.895 --> 03:56.215
Daniel Glass, was Kenny West
murdered by animal activists?

03:56.295 --> 03:58.255
- Don't talk to them, Daniel.
- Did Kenny West kill himself?

03:58.335 --> 03:59.495
That is a lie, okay?

03:59.575 --> 04:03.695
That is fake news.
A man is dead and this... this hero

04:03.775 --> 04:07.575
is gravely ill with cancer, okay? So you
should feel ashamed of yourselves.

04:07.655 --> 04:09.735
Out of the way!

04:13.015 --> 04:14.335
Are you in charge now?

04:14.415 --> 04:15.655
No, no.

04:15.735 --> 04:18.255
Um, Mr. West's daughter, Katerina,

04:18.935 --> 04:22.495
she inherits the role of CEO
in the event of a tragedy.

04:23.415 --> 04:26.015
Oh, wow.
Didn't even know he had a daughter.

04:26.095 --> 04:27.815
- Yes.
- What's she like?

04:28.775 --> 04:32.095
Well, she is nothing like Mr. West.

04:32.655 --> 04:34.055
Look at you!

04:34.135 --> 04:36.135
A bunch of losers
who couldn't sell health insurance

04:36.215 --> 04:38.255
even if your worthless lives
depended on it.

04:38.335 --> 04:39.655
I should line you all up against the wall

04:39.735 --> 04:41.655
and slit your fucking throats,
you cum-snorting cunts!

04:45.455 --> 04:47.015
That was an impression of my dad.

04:47.095 --> 04:48.655
I was just trying to lighten the mood.

04:48.735 --> 04:51.135
Oh! That's very good.

04:51.215 --> 04:53.295
Thank you. I'm not my dad.

04:53.375 --> 04:55.735
My dad was a psycho
and he only cared about one thing...

04:56.295 --> 04:58.295
- money.
- And he quite liked hunting.

04:58.375 --> 05:01.095
Ah, yes, he loved killing things

05:01.175 --> 05:02.615
and then he killed himself.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.495
She really isn't anything like her father.

05:06.575 --> 05:07.935
She's prettier.

05:08.015 --> 05:10.015
You guys have made this company
a great success.

05:10.095 --> 05:11.575
You should give yourself
a round of applause.

05:21.415 --> 05:23.695
- Is that what I think it is?
- No, no.

05:23.775 --> 05:25.935
Um, your father, he...

05:26.975 --> 05:29.255
soiled himself at the end.

05:29.335 --> 05:31.655
- Nope. That <i>is</i> what I thought it was.
- What is it?

05:31.735 --> 05:33.935
Anyway, I would like you to be
the first to know

05:34.015 --> 05:35.255
my intentions for We Cover.

05:35.495 --> 05:37.775
- I'm selling it.
- What?

05:38.895 --> 05:42.135
No, you can't.
We Cover is your father's legacy.

05:42.215 --> 05:43.855
That's his legacy.

05:43.935 --> 05:45.975
I... But what about me?

05:46.055 --> 05:48.335
Well, me and the staff, all of us?

05:48.415 --> 05:49.815
Well, I'm sure the buyers
will keep you on

05:49.895 --> 05:50.935
until they find someone better.

05:51.015 --> 05:54.015
Don't you think it a trifle rash to sell?

05:54.735 --> 05:56.695
We Cover is a potential gold mine,

05:56.775 --> 05:59.175
what with the state of the NHS
at the moment.

05:59.255 --> 06:02.375
No, I'm selling because I have to
get back to my family in Nigeria.

06:02.455 --> 06:04.655
Oh, I didn't realize you had family.

06:06.935 --> 06:08.015
Oh.

06:08.695 --> 06:09.535
Okay.

06:12.615 --> 06:15.735
- Are you breastfeeding that monkey?
- It's an orphaned gorilla.

06:15.815 --> 06:17.735
- Yes, well...
- Why, does that bother you?

06:18.375 --> 06:19.535
No, it's just...

06:19.615 --> 06:20.735
Mother's milk.

06:21.295 --> 06:22.335
Oh.

06:22.415 --> 06:24.895
How... do you produce the milk?

06:24.975 --> 06:26.335
Hormone injections.

06:26.415 --> 06:27.855
But they do give me vivid night terrors.

06:28.695 --> 06:30.095
Look, in order to sell,

06:30.175 --> 06:32.215
we're going to have to keep a tight lid
on all the things

06:32.295 --> 06:33.535
surrounding my father's death.

06:33.615 --> 06:35.895
The only people who know
what really happened are us four,

06:35.975 --> 06:37.095
Michael's daughter and...

06:37.175 --> 06:39.295
Sorry. I mean, what... what happened?

06:40.455 --> 06:41.855
What?

06:41.935 --> 06:44.615
Okay, the three of us and the staff member

06:44.695 --> 06:46.215
- that found him.
- Linda.

06:48.055 --> 06:49.615
Mr. West didn't hang himself.

06:50.495 --> 06:51.735
It was a sex game.

06:52.775 --> 06:53.815
What?

06:53.895 --> 06:56.615
You know, where people strangle
themselves while masturbating.

06:56.695 --> 06:58.175
Oh, my God!

06:58.975 --> 07:00.935
And also... of course.

07:03.815 --> 07:05.295
Just keep it to yourself.

07:05.495 --> 07:08.055
Oh, don't worry, you can trust me.

07:08.855 --> 07:10.255
And you can trust me too.

07:15.415 --> 07:17.575
Okay. You can get your life back.

07:17.655 --> 07:19.455
No more Kenny, no more bullshit.

07:19.895 --> 07:22.175
First, end things with Becca, move out.

07:22.775 --> 07:25.975
Second, tell Glennis
we're ending this cancer shit.

07:26.415 --> 07:28.815
Third, ask Linda out.

07:28.895 --> 07:30.055
She's into you.

07:31.055 --> 07:34.055
Fourth, tell Will to fuck off home.

07:34.135 --> 07:35.735
- Who's Will?
- Jesus Christ!

07:36.575 --> 07:38.015
Why did you sneak up on me?

07:38.095 --> 07:40.495
I didn't sneak up on you.
I've just come in for a little tinkle.

07:40.575 --> 07:42.735
Listen, I want to get better quicker.

07:43.695 --> 07:45.935
Well, I mean,
you've barely been diagnosed

07:46.015 --> 07:48.295
and you've only just started
your "chemotherapy."

07:48.375 --> 07:51.135
Can't we fudge the timeline?
You know, fake some new scans?

07:51.215 --> 07:53.215
No one will believe that.

07:53.815 --> 07:56.135
We could fast-track "surgery."

07:56.215 --> 07:58.015
Okay, great. So, like, in a few weeks?

07:58.095 --> 08:01.135
Yes, okay. Kenny West's daughter
is planning on selling the company,

08:01.215 --> 08:03.375
so she can continue
to breastfeed monkeys.

08:04.175 --> 08:05.535
It would be nice to be out of this pickle.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.375
All right, well, let's use this time

08:07.455 --> 08:10.255
and we'll book you in
for your "operation."

08:10.335 --> 08:11.935
- Stop doing that.
- I'm sorry.

08:12.015 --> 08:14.215
Ah, weeing, the great leveler.

08:16.375 --> 08:19.015
- Can you keep a secret?
- What do <i>you</i> think?

08:19.095 --> 08:20.415
Oh, yes, the cancer.

08:20.495 --> 08:22.135
Well, here's another one for you.

08:22.975 --> 08:24.695
Kenny West hung himself.

08:24.775 --> 08:27.455
- It was autoerotic asphyxiation.
- No, no, no, no!

08:27.535 --> 08:29.735
No, he didn't kill himself in a car.

08:29.815 --> 08:33.294
He hung himself in Michael's office.
Believe you me, I've seen the stain.

08:33.375 --> 08:35.575
- Just look it up.
- Oh.

08:39.855 --> 08:40.855
What the fuck?

08:40.934 --> 08:43.655
However high you are... bang!

08:43.735 --> 08:46.935
If you land on the right position,
you can survive the highest height.

08:47.015 --> 08:49.735
Oh, Daniel, here's your friend Will.

08:49.815 --> 08:51.175
Yeah. What are you doing here?

08:51.255 --> 08:54.455
What, a best friend needs a reason
to come and see his best friend?

08:54.535 --> 08:58.735
Oh, that's nice. We were just talking
about your other friend, Ash.

08:58.815 --> 09:00.695
Well, Will was saying he fell, but...

09:00.775 --> 09:02.415
It wasn't a fall.

09:03.335 --> 09:05.295
He was in a hit and run.

09:05.975 --> 09:07.495
Yeah, that's what I thought.

09:07.775 --> 09:09.855
Oh, yeah, sorry.

09:09.935 --> 09:11.375
I always make that mistake.

09:11.455 --> 09:14.975
It's because his injuries made it
look like he'd had a fall, so...

09:16.375 --> 09:17.335
Oh.

09:17.415 --> 09:19.695
Okay, so I was thinking
we could go grab a bite to eat.

09:21.175 --> 09:24.375
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, there's a café downstairs.

09:24.935 --> 09:28.055
- Cool. Okay, well, Linda, bye-bye.
- Bye.

09:29.215 --> 09:31.335
"The loss of oxygen delivery
increases pleasure,

09:31.415 --> 09:33.175
heightening masturbatory sensation."

09:33.255 --> 09:36.055
Why would someone
strangle themselves mid-coitus?

09:36.135 --> 09:37.375
Glennis.

09:37.455 --> 09:40.655
No! Are you kidding me?
<i>The</i> famous Dr. Glennis?

09:40.735 --> 09:42.055
Oh!

09:42.135 --> 09:44.975
Ah, well, thank you.
I wouldn't say famous,

09:45.055 --> 09:48.095
although I have been getting
some rather positive feedback

09:48.175 --> 09:49.655
for my work recently. And you are...?

09:49.735 --> 09:51.735
This is my American friend.

09:51.815 --> 09:53.935
- Er, from America.
- Hey.

09:54.015 --> 09:56.455
Will. We're just gonna get some lunch.

09:56.535 --> 09:58.095
Right. Well, I would love to join you,

09:58.175 --> 10:01.775
but I have a rather important meeting
with a senior doctor

10:01.855 --> 10:05.815
and believe it or not,
we're having a game of tennis!

10:08.095 --> 10:10.575
- Right.
- Right, well, I'm off.

10:10.655 --> 10:12.295
Yeah, we're going the same way.

10:12.375 --> 10:13.735
Oh, great.

10:13.815 --> 10:15.015
- After you.
- Yes.

10:18.055 --> 10:19.415
<i>We want to give our customers...</i>

10:19.495 --> 10:20.695
Going down, guys?

10:20.775 --> 10:21.815
We're on the top floor.

10:22.295 --> 10:23.455
Oh, yes, of course.

10:25.495 --> 10:27.455
- That's a very unusual mask.
- Bollocks!

10:27.535 --> 10:29.215
Haven't seen one of those for many years.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.175
It's old. Health care in the US
costs so much.

10:32.255 --> 10:34.135
I'm saving up for a transplant.

10:34.215 --> 10:36.215
Ah, right.

10:36.855 --> 10:38.175
What's it covering?

10:38.255 --> 10:39.695
Okay, so I'm eight years old.

10:39.775 --> 10:41.335
Mom had been ironing in our trailer.

10:41.855 --> 10:43.135
She left the iron on.

10:43.855 --> 10:45.735
I was standing on a stool,
reaching for the cookie jar

10:45.815 --> 10:47.135
and the stool gives way,

10:47.215 --> 10:49.535
so I come down,
bring the ironing board with me and...

10:50.575 --> 10:52.535
- Tragic tale.
- Yeah.

10:53.175 --> 10:55.015
- Let's have a little look...
- Oh, no!

10:55.095 --> 10:56.735
- Honestly, it's fine.
- I'm highly trained.

10:56.815 --> 10:59.655
I might be able to sort something better
out for you.

10:59.735 --> 11:01.215
Er, no, I'm great, thank you.

11:01.295 --> 11:04.815
I have seen all sorts. Nothing to be
ashamed of. Let's have a peek.

11:09.095 --> 11:11.215
Will!

11:12.175 --> 11:14.175
- He bit me!
- Sorry.

11:15.495 --> 11:16.735
Oh.

11:16.815 --> 11:18.175
Dr. Glennis, I...

11:18.815 --> 11:21.815
I'm really sorry. I just don't like
people looking at my face.

11:25.415 --> 11:27.575
Oh, it's my wife. I should get going.

11:27.655 --> 11:29.375
Dr. Glennis, again, I really am...

11:29.455 --> 11:30.735
No.

11:31.695 --> 11:33.055
You've done enough.

11:39.575 --> 11:40.975
You bit my doctor!

11:41.055 --> 11:45.215
Daniel, you don't know what it's like
having this hideous visage.

11:45.935 --> 11:47.015
I'm a monster!

11:49.255 --> 11:50.095
Lunch?

11:50.575 --> 11:52.535
Although technically, I've already eaten.

11:52.615 --> 11:53.615
Daniel?

11:54.815 --> 11:56.455
Hello. I'm Linda.

11:56.535 --> 11:58.935
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry for your loss.

11:59.015 --> 12:02.415
Don't be. Are you okay?
Do you need see a counselor?

12:02.495 --> 12:06.935
Oh, no, I'm fine. I once saw a man
get run over by a tram.

12:09.015 --> 12:12.815
So... could you keep the details
of what you saw to yourself?

12:12.895 --> 12:14.295
You mean not tell anyone?

12:14.815 --> 12:15.735
Exactly.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.855
- You haven't, have you?
- Me? No, of course not.

12:20.295 --> 12:21.415
What's that?

12:21.495 --> 12:24.055
Oh, that's a stress thumb.

12:24.135 --> 12:26.775
You place it over your actual thumb,
suck and it releases a...

12:26.855 --> 12:30.895
Linda, I don't think Miss West
has got time for your inventions.

12:30.975 --> 12:32.775
Well, you must be stressed
with everything.

12:32.855 --> 12:36.455
They're usually £20, but please, take one.

12:37.815 --> 12:38.895
Mmm.

12:40.095 --> 12:42.775
Looks like something my dad
would've used in one of his sex games.

12:43.175 --> 12:44.655
I daresay he did.

12:46.775 --> 12:48.215
<i>I've bought you a new racquet.</i>

12:48.295 --> 12:50.295
Oh, thank you, my love.

12:52.055 --> 12:54.175
Jesus Christ!

12:54.255 --> 12:55.575
<i>What's wrong? Are you okay?</i>

12:55.655 --> 12:57.975
Oh! I've got a bit of cramp.

12:58.055 --> 12:59.095
<i>Is there anything you need?</i>

12:59.175 --> 13:01.535
Hang on one second, darling.
I'm just going to put you on hold.

13:04.375 --> 13:05.335
Ah!

13:05.415 --> 13:07.455
Um... how about a sweatband?

13:07.935 --> 13:10.135
<i>Already got you one, my sweaty husband.</i>

13:10.215 --> 13:11.215
<i>See you in an hour.</i>

13:11.295 --> 13:14.615
- <i>I'm so excited!</i>
- Yes. Yes, me too.

13:22.815 --> 13:24.375
Eugh! Omelets!

13:24.935 --> 13:26.935
I can't believe
they don't do hard boiled eggs here.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.815
I mean, God knows what's in this.

13:33.695 --> 13:35.855
So you, er... you booked your flight yet?

13:36.575 --> 13:39.455
Wow! Anyone would think
you wanna get rid of me.

13:39.535 --> 13:41.735
No! No, it's just...

13:42.175 --> 13:43.495
It's not that. It's just...

13:44.135 --> 13:47.335
You know, we've talked online for years,

13:47.415 --> 13:49.855
but I've really known nothing about you.

13:50.335 --> 13:52.775
But, dude, I mean,
that can totally change now, you know?

13:52.855 --> 13:55.095
I mean, isn't it great
to finally put a face to the name?

13:55.175 --> 13:56.495
Or you know...

13:56.575 --> 13:57.575
...half a face.

13:57.655 --> 13:59.935
- Half a face!
- Yes, good one.

14:01.015 --> 14:04.095
So, I was thinking,
after my cousin's wedding,

14:04.175 --> 14:05.415
I could come back...

14:06.375 --> 14:07.815
permanently.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.495
Fill the void that Ash's death created,
you know?

14:10.575 --> 14:12.615
Yeah, yeah, that... that's not gonna work.

14:12.695 --> 14:15.015
Dude, of course it's gonna work.
I'm your best friend

14:15.655 --> 14:16.735
No.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.935
No, Will, we're not best friends.

14:22.415 --> 14:23.575
Yeah, we are.

14:23.695 --> 14:25.695
No. We're not.

14:28.295 --> 14:30.895
You know, we're...
we're online best friends.

14:31.535 --> 14:32.655
Got it.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.615
Look, listen...

14:35.695 --> 14:37.255
Things are changing, okay?

14:37.335 --> 14:41.695
Me and Dr. Glennis,
we're ending the lie, okay?

14:41.775 --> 14:43.455
And I'm leaving Becca, so...

14:44.295 --> 14:45.495
What?

14:46.535 --> 14:47.535
Why?

14:49.015 --> 14:50.895
She was shagging my best friend.

14:50.975 --> 14:52.455
Oh, Ash this, Ash that!

14:52.535 --> 14:53.895
Like he was ever that great.

14:53.975 --> 14:55.375
You know what, Daniel?

14:55.455 --> 14:57.735
I would never do that to you, dude.
No, never!

14:57.815 --> 14:58.855
I'm sorry, Will.

14:59.375 --> 15:02.135
But it's just... time to move on.

15:12.975 --> 15:15.495
You, know Daniel,
you've been through so much already.

15:17.695 --> 15:19.815
I'm just sorry
I haven't been more understanding.

15:19.895 --> 15:20.895
No!

15:20.975 --> 15:23.055
No, you've been great, you know?

15:23.135 --> 15:24.495
I've loved...

15:25.735 --> 15:27.335
- Yeah.
- You know.

15:28.215 --> 15:29.935
But I just think it's time
for me to kind of

15:30.015 --> 15:32.095
do this on my own, you know?

15:32.695 --> 15:35.655
Well, see you on the battlefield, soldier.

15:36.095 --> 15:38.255
- Yeah.
- I gotta get to the airport.

15:47.375 --> 15:48.535
Fucking hell!

15:50.375 --> 15:51.455
Tick.

15:57.935 --> 16:00.175
Ah! That's the ticket.

16:00.255 --> 16:01.215
Oh!

16:02.575 --> 16:05.095
Andrew Agassi,

16:05.935 --> 16:07.975
eat your heart out. Right.

16:11.735 --> 16:14.535
Hey, Linda, I was...

16:14.615 --> 16:16.215
Oh, I meant to ask you,

16:16.295 --> 16:18.695
are you allowed to drink
on your medication?

16:19.375 --> 16:21.975
Er, yeah, yeah. Er, why?

16:22.055 --> 16:25.575
Oh, well, some of us are going out
after work to celebrate Mr. West's death.

16:25.655 --> 16:28.295
Oh, you mean to celebrate his life?

16:29.495 --> 16:31.415
Yeah. You can bring your girlfriend.

16:32.015 --> 16:34.295
Oh, yeah, actually we're...

16:34.375 --> 16:36.615
we're kind of breaking up, you know.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.055
How interesting.

16:39.095 --> 16:40.535
Well, just bring yourself, then.

16:42.135 --> 16:43.255
Yeah.

16:43.935 --> 16:45.175
Perfect.

16:47.295 --> 16:48.495
Tick.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.095
So, do you want to hit a few balls
before we start?

16:52.175 --> 16:54.575
- Well, let's just get going, shall we?
- Right-o.

16:55.055 --> 16:55.935
Good luck.

16:56.295 --> 16:57.735
Let them win, remember?

16:57.815 --> 16:59.335
Yes, my treasure.

17:06.494 --> 17:08.734
- Nice drop shot.
- Yes, thank you.

17:08.815 --> 17:09.815
Love-15.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.615
Argh!

17:21.135 --> 17:22.295
You've got a deft touch.

17:22.375 --> 17:26.015
I keep on expecting a fast one with all
the oomph you keep on putting into it.

17:26.095 --> 17:29.415
Ah, yes, thank you, Sherry.

17:29.975 --> 17:32.615
- You're supposed to let them win.
- I am trying, Annette.

17:37.175 --> 17:38.175
Oh, hi, darling.

17:38.935 --> 17:40.535
- Good day at work?
- Yeah.

17:40.615 --> 17:41.815
Yeah, it was, actually. Yeah.

17:43.295 --> 17:45.695
- And we've got something to talk about.
- Yeah, go on. What?

17:50.135 --> 17:52.095
Will, I... I thought you were leaving?

17:53.375 --> 17:54.735
I couldn't find any flights.

17:54.815 --> 17:56.935
What about your cousin's wedding?

17:57.015 --> 17:58.495
Oh, my cousin's a tool.

17:59.935 --> 18:01.895
I'd much rather stay here with you guys.

18:02.935 --> 18:05.255
No. No, no, no, no, no.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.935
- Becca said...
- No. Will can stay

18:07.015 --> 18:08.175
as long as he likes.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.015
He is a great house guest.

18:10.935 --> 18:12.575
And you need a friend right now, Daniel.

18:19.135 --> 18:20.135
This one for the match.

18:31.055 --> 18:32.255
An ace!

18:34.775 --> 18:36.335
Game, set and match.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.135
You were supposed to let them win!

18:38.215 --> 18:39.415
I tried, my darling.

18:39.495 --> 18:41.335
- Is your hand all right?
- It's just a friction burn.

18:41.415 --> 18:43.775
Darling, have you been
sneaking in lessons?

18:43.855 --> 18:46.295
- Iain, well done!
- Argh!

18:47.015 --> 18:51.215
Now, listen, as Kenny West's
membership has... expired,

18:51.295 --> 18:54.855
there's an opening.
Would you be interested in a spot?

18:54.935 --> 18:57.055
Yes, yes. Yes, we would.

18:57.615 --> 19:00.135
Good.

19:00.215 --> 19:01.695
Iain, we're going to be members!

19:02.335 --> 19:03.775
They seemed interested.

19:03.855 --> 19:07.095
Well, Seamus Wayne
have bought and dissolved

19:07.175 --> 19:10.655
three health insurance firms
in the last 18 months.

19:11.135 --> 19:13.335
We're going to be on the streets
busking for change.

19:13.415 --> 19:14.615
Finally you'll make an honest living.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.815
No, but seriously, I've worked
very hard for this company...

19:17.895 --> 19:19.895
- You've gotta be fucking kidding!
- No, I promise you,

19:19.975 --> 19:23.495
- there's years of unpaid overtime...
- No, this. It's all over Reddit.

19:23.575 --> 19:25.055
I knew it was gonna come out.

19:25.135 --> 19:26.135
Okay, what's Reddit?

19:26.215 --> 19:28.055
Just look at BBC News in about two hours.

19:28.135 --> 19:30.255
My dad's death, all the gory details.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.735
Oh, and come on,
they've got memes already.

19:32.815 --> 19:34.495
Oh, not meme... What are memes?

19:34.575 --> 19:36.775
Kenny West CEO wanks over insurance...

19:37.175 --> 19:38.535
Seamus Wayne.

19:39.015 --> 19:40.175
Hello again.

19:41.655 --> 19:44.695
Yes... it <i>is</i> rather unfortunate.

19:45.935 --> 19:49.215
Well, I will tell Miss West the bad news.

19:50.215 --> 19:52.215
Well, that's a shame.

19:52.695 --> 19:53.935
It is what it is.

19:54.015 --> 19:56.495
It is what it is. It is what it is.

19:57.015 --> 19:58.415
It is what it is.

20:02.855 --> 20:04.335
Coming to bed, my tennis pro?

20:04.415 --> 20:06.295
Er, yes, darling.

20:07.495 --> 20:10.495
I'm just going to finish
my victor's drink.

20:10.575 --> 20:12.975
Well, somebody deserves a cuddle

20:13.055 --> 20:15.615
for getting us on the list
for club membership.

20:18.095 --> 20:19.615
So don't be long.

20:21.375 --> 20:24.095
I'll be up as soon as I... can,
my darling.

20:28.495 --> 20:31.415
It's so lovely to have you here,
Will, it really is.

20:32.215 --> 20:34.135
So, who fancies a film?

20:34.215 --> 20:35.695
Oh, yeah.

20:35.775 --> 20:37.975
Yeah? Daniel, do you want to choose one?

20:38.775 --> 20:39.975
Yeah, fine.

20:40.415 --> 20:43.215
I'm just gonna go to the loo. Can I get
anyone a drink on my way back?

20:43.295 --> 20:46.935
Oh, you know, I would love
a cranberry juice, Becca.

20:47.255 --> 20:48.495
Mm-hm.

20:51.775 --> 20:52.895
Right, how long are you staying?

20:55.335 --> 20:56.335
As long as I like.

20:56.415 --> 20:58.855
I told you, I'm leaving Becca.

21:00.815 --> 21:02.295
I'm gonna tell her.

21:04.775 --> 21:05.895
Tell her?

21:06.775 --> 21:08.015
Everything.

21:08.095 --> 21:11.535
You faking cancer,
how Ash fell from your window,

21:11.615 --> 21:14.015
- how you put him in the road to make it...
- Don't.

21:15.095 --> 21:16.735
One thing you were right about today.

21:17.455 --> 21:18.695
We're not friends.

21:18.775 --> 21:20.055
Okay, look...

21:20.135 --> 21:23.015
- I'm sorry what I said earlier, okay?
- I'll tell you what.

21:23.535 --> 21:25.215
You give me ten grand

21:25.295 --> 21:27.015
and I'll disappear without telling anyone.

21:27.815 --> 21:29.015
I don't have ten grand.

21:29.095 --> 21:30.375
Then find it.

21:31.055 --> 21:33.575
Otherwise you'll have a shit ton
of explaining to do.

21:35.055 --> 21:36.495
God, haven't you picked one yet?

21:36.575 --> 21:37.695
No.

21:39.015 --> 21:42.775
No, I thought we'd let our...
guest choose.

21:43.735 --> 21:45.415
Do you guys have <i>The Notebook?</i>

21:45.775 --> 21:47.895
Oh! Yes!

21:48.575 --> 21:50.375
Yes! Daniel, get it.

21:51.975 --> 21:54.175
Come on, Iain. What are you up to?
