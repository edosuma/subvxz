08:09.994 --> 08:11.300
-[Earl] Paddington?
-[Sean] Oh, yeah.

08:14.259 --> 08:16.131
[Miles] You remember when you
were goin' into labor

08:16.261 --> 08:20.048
-and you said, "Never mind."
-[chuckles]

08:20.178 --> 08:22.615
"I don't want a kid.
I take it back."

08:22.702 --> 08:24.400
And I was like, "Baby, that's
not really gonna work out,

08:24.530 --> 08:25.923
"because you are crowning
right now.

08:26.010 --> 08:27.533
I can see
this motherfucker's head."

08:27.664 --> 08:28.883
[laughter]

08:29.013 --> 08:31.146
Yeah, I mean...

08:31.276 --> 08:33.713
we got our son,
and it was better after.

08:33.844 --> 08:35.411
Right, I'm not saying
it's gonna be easy,

08:35.541 --> 08:38.283
but it is happening,
and it is gonna get better.

08:40.895 --> 08:43.593
I can hear your mom
railing on the phone

08:43.723 --> 08:46.813
about the evils of hospitals
and...

08:46.944 --> 08:48.467
tryin' to tell me
to squat in the bathtub.

08:48.598 --> 08:50.078
Like, the fuck, Rainey?

08:50.165 --> 08:52.210
She's a hippie mom.

08:52.341 --> 08:55.735
Well, I also remember

08:55.822 --> 08:58.129
you were supposed to play me
a song to keep me calm.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.652
-What was it?
-Oh.

08:59.783 --> 09:02.177
-What was it?
-I don't know.

09:02.307 --> 09:03.830
Come on,
that was your only job.

09:03.961 --> 09:05.310
I don't know. I don't know!

09:05.397 --> 09:07.225
Clearly, it didn't work!

09:07.312 --> 09:08.748
I just remember
pulling up to Highland

09:08.879 --> 09:11.142
and getting in a wheelchair.

09:11.273 --> 09:13.057
And that one dude who got shot,

09:13.188 --> 09:14.711
he was getting pulled out
of an ambulance,

09:14.798 --> 09:16.495
and he was screamin',
and I was screamin',

09:16.626 --> 09:18.933
and I was like, "I don't know
who's in more pain,"

09:19.063 --> 09:21.674
but I think it was me.

09:21.805 --> 09:23.546
Well, you were certainly making
the bigger deal out of it.

09:25.113 --> 09:27.028
My dad showed up.

09:27.158 --> 09:28.812
-Oh, man!
-Wow.

09:28.899 --> 09:30.901
Yeah.

09:31.032 --> 09:34.470
Well, put a stop to that.
[chuckles]

09:34.557 --> 09:36.341
He wasn't gonna
fuck up that day.

09:38.430 --> 09:41.781
[sighs]
You were so tough that day.

09:41.868 --> 09:44.784
Just... hard. [laughs]

09:44.915 --> 09:46.525
You might be
the hardest person I know.

09:46.656 --> 09:48.266
-I was giving birth.
-I don't wanna do it.

09:48.397 --> 09:49.920
-[laughter]
-I'd have turned back.

09:53.141 --> 09:55.404
-You were a dad.
-Yeah.

09:55.534 --> 09:57.406
-Cryin'.
-Cryin'. Bawlin'.

09:57.536 --> 09:59.234
Mm-hmm.

09:59.364 --> 10:02.411
I mean, I-I suddenly
was this thing,

10:02.498 --> 10:04.456
I'd never had.

10:04.587 --> 10:06.197
Yeah.

10:06.328 --> 10:09.070
-I remember you sayin' that.
-Hmm.

10:09.157 --> 10:11.289
My mom was there.

10:11.420 --> 10:13.683
Yeah.

10:13.770 --> 10:16.251
She said he looked
like her father.

10:19.297 --> 10:21.299
She only had a year with Sean.

10:24.128 --> 10:25.738
That was tough.

10:25.869 --> 10:27.653
That was real tough.

10:27.740 --> 10:29.612
Yeah.

10:29.742 --> 10:32.789
The end of the pre-Sean era.

10:32.919 --> 10:35.400
[with English accent]
The pre-Sean era.

10:35.531 --> 10:36.836
[with English accent]
A time before Sean.

10:36.923 --> 10:38.925
A time before the child.

10:39.056 --> 10:40.840
[laughter]

10:40.927 --> 10:45.193
[normally] Fuckin',
now he can walk and talk and...

10:45.323 --> 10:48.761
ask questions and know things.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.503
I just wish we could go back.

10:51.634 --> 10:52.852
I wanted to go out
for New Year's.

10:52.983 --> 10:54.463
I wanted to get dressed up.

10:54.593 --> 10:56.334
I wanted to see you
all dressed up.

10:57.901 --> 10:58.902
[Miles] Today's the day, Ash.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.253
What are we gonna tell our son?

11:05.691 --> 11:07.345
-[refrigerator door slams]
-[Sean exhales heavily]

11:07.432 --> 11:10.131
What I'm sayin' is,
is that Black is an experience.

11:10.261 --> 11:13.003
And baby boy
might experience it less.

11:13.134 --> 11:15.614
Well, not less.
Like, he--differently.

11:15.745 --> 11:17.529
Right. That's what I'm sayin'.

11:17.660 --> 11:20.619
So, some Black people have
more privilege than others.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.143
Black privilege?

11:22.230 --> 11:23.405
How the fuck
does that activate?

11:23.535 --> 11:25.276
No, I hear
what Janelle is sayin'.

11:25.407 --> 11:27.713
Proximity
to Eurocentricity privilege.

11:27.844 --> 11:29.063
-[Janelle] Thank you.
-[Trish] Sean.

11:29.193 --> 11:31.021
What exactly did
Mama Nancy say to you?

11:31.152 --> 11:33.328
[Nancy] Don't ask
a clearly confused child.

11:33.458 --> 11:35.417
He needs answers,
not more questions.

11:35.547 --> 11:38.420
Yeah, but, Ma, did you ask him
in a weird way?

11:38.550 --> 11:39.551
[Nancy] What'd I say?

11:39.682 --> 11:41.640
See, y'all are trippin'.

11:41.771 --> 11:44.295
Sean is from here.
He's Black, okay?

11:44.426 --> 11:46.515
Ain't no semi-Blackness.

11:46.645 --> 11:48.604
There's all kinda shades
of Black.

11:48.691 --> 11:50.823
He from the West.
His daddy in jail.

11:50.954 --> 11:52.999
He with the shits,
as far as I know.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.653
I don't know
if "with the shits"

11:54.784 --> 11:55.698
-has anything to do with it.
-[Janelle] Right.

11:55.828 --> 11:57.700
Because them is circumstances.

11:57.830 --> 11:59.658
You know, Blackness is not
just a bunch of circumstances.

11:59.745 --> 12:02.357
Yes, and some circumstances
are uniquely Black.

12:02.487 --> 12:04.010
-[Earl] Facts.
-Exactly, exactly.

12:04.141 --> 12:07.536
See, the nigga who was raised
rich in Piedmont

12:07.623 --> 12:09.233
and went to private school

12:09.364 --> 12:11.192
is not the same Black
the way we are Black.

12:11.322 --> 12:12.715
The nigga can't play spades

12:12.845 --> 12:14.543
and the nigga
can't play bones, so...

12:14.673 --> 12:18.112
Well, hold up, 'cause I can't
play spades or dominoes.

12:18.242 --> 12:20.375
-Yeah, I tried.
-What? Really?

12:20.505 --> 12:22.725
No, I can't play spades, Earl.

12:22.855 --> 12:25.075
But what she talkin' about
is the hood pass,

12:25.206 --> 12:26.946
and that's something
completely different.

12:27.077 --> 12:28.644
Wait, okay, so y'all sayin'
the hood pass

12:28.774 --> 12:31.603
has nothing to do with it, hmm?

12:31.690 --> 12:33.388
Like, y'all ain't never
read nobody

12:33.518 --> 12:35.738
on they Blackness
for how hood they are?

12:35.825 --> 12:37.392
- Hmm. That's interesting.
-Cap! Okay.

12:37.522 --> 12:39.002
Mm.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.743
Yeah, I mean,
I did just read you

12:40.830 --> 12:42.919
'cause you can't
play spades, Janelle.

12:43.049 --> 12:45.269
Oh, my God, y'all,
it's about how the world

12:45.356 --> 12:47.097
sees dark skin, period.

12:47.228 --> 12:48.446
[Trish]
Okay, I feel what you sayin',

12:48.577 --> 12:50.013
-but what I am saying...
-[Earl] Okay.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.755
...is that Black
is Black, right?

12:52.885 --> 12:54.583
-[Earl] Okay, I can dig that.
-Okay.

12:54.713 --> 12:58.500
Then, depending on where
you raised and your environment

12:58.630 --> 13:01.024
makes you more or less Black.

13:01.111 --> 13:02.243
-[Janelle] No, Trish.
-That don't make no sense.

13:02.373 --> 13:03.896
I'm hella Black.
I'm officially super--

13:03.983 --> 13:06.421
like, I'm actually certified.

13:06.551 --> 13:07.639
I'm actually--
at the DMV, I'm Black.

13:07.770 --> 13:08.901
[Trish] Uh-huh.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.251
[Earl] You know what I mean?

13:10.381 --> 13:11.426
And I'm from the East
but, like,

13:11.556 --> 13:13.297
the nice part of the East.

13:13.384 --> 13:14.733
You know what I'm sayin'?
My parents is cool.

13:14.820 --> 13:16.431
They love each other.
They good.

13:16.561 --> 13:19.303
Like, they got, like,
retirement money.

13:19.434 --> 13:21.175
My pops drive a Mercedes.
I'm less Black?

13:21.305 --> 13:24.395
Yeah, nigga, and you were
in Quentin for drugs.

13:24.526 --> 13:26.354
-So now I'm Black?
-[Nancy] Mm.

13:26.484 --> 13:28.094
You're saying
I'm post-jail Black, Trish?

13:28.182 --> 13:30.314
No, what I'm saying is that--

13:30.445 --> 13:32.751
No, what you're saying makes
no sense at the end of the day.

13:32.882 --> 13:34.144
'Cause here, look.

13:34.275 --> 13:36.581
Your little beige self

13:36.712 --> 13:41.064
cannot tell me
or qualify my Blackness at all.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.109
So what's up with that?

13:43.197 --> 13:45.547
Well, Nancy the same shade
as me.

13:45.677 --> 13:47.201
Her grandmother is white.

13:47.331 --> 13:48.376
Does that make her
any less Black?

13:48.506 --> 13:50.204
[Janelle] Uh-uh. Hold up.

13:50.334 --> 13:52.075
[Trish] Does that make her
less Black?

13:52.162 --> 13:53.424
[Earl] You're talkin' about
people granny like that?

13:53.555 --> 13:55.600
Hold up!
My momma is old beige Black.

13:55.687 --> 13:57.646
So that's-that's
hella different.

13:57.776 --> 14:00.214
Okay, full stop.
First of all, not old.

14:00.301 --> 14:02.390
No, it makes sense.
Like, 40 years ago,

14:02.520 --> 14:03.695
would've been
a little bit better,

14:03.826 --> 14:06.002
but Nancy's still
Rosa Parks Black.

14:06.132 --> 14:08.178
-[Janelle] Mm.
-You 2018 light-skinned.

14:08.309 --> 14:10.485
You know what I'm sayin'?
You like Doja Cat Black.

14:10.615 --> 14:12.313
-[Trish] Oh!
-[Janelle] Aw, shit.

14:12.443 --> 14:13.966
-How old do y'all think I am?
-You really wanna know?

14:14.053 --> 14:15.490
[Trish] Hang on. Hey, hold up.

14:15.620 --> 14:16.578
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
y'all.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.884
You think I look like Doja Cat?

14:19.015 --> 14:22.279
Wow. Wow.

14:22.366 --> 14:24.586
This is my whole point, okay?

14:24.716 --> 14:27.328
Growin' up,
everybody used to say

14:27.415 --> 14:29.025
how beautiful
Ashley was, right?

14:29.155 --> 14:31.506
Everybody always said her hair
was so pretty.

14:31.593 --> 14:33.464
They always wanted to know
what was she mixed with.

14:33.595 --> 14:35.510
Everybody was flauntin'
they mix.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.555
"Ooh, well, girl, you know,
I'm mixed with India."

14:37.642 --> 14:39.992
"Well, girl, shit,
I'm part Filipino."

14:40.123 --> 14:43.213
Meanwhile, I'm over there
rockin' Afro puffs,

14:43.344 --> 14:45.041
standin' next to bitches
who look like you,

14:45.171 --> 14:46.564
and they over there tellin' me

14:46.695 --> 14:48.349
that I need to get
my fuckin' hair pressed.

14:48.479 --> 14:50.481
[Nancy] Okay, so let's
back it up for a second,

14:50.612 --> 14:52.788
my worldly academic youngsters,

14:52.918 --> 14:55.051
'cause I been Black

14:55.181 --> 14:57.140
for a long time.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.663
Well, not that long. [chuckles]

14:58.794 --> 15:00.404
But longer than y'all.

15:00.535 --> 15:03.189
And I came here
before you all were born,

15:03.277 --> 15:05.235
when Oakland was a place
you went to

15:05.366 --> 15:06.976
to get away
from how Black people--

15:07.106 --> 15:09.283
all kinds of Black people--

15:09.370 --> 15:11.502
were being treated
in the South.

15:11.589 --> 15:13.330
And it was a Black city.

15:13.461 --> 15:15.419
Ooh, the Panthers built it up.

15:15.550 --> 15:17.943
Then the FBI
made it a crack city.

15:18.074 --> 15:20.729
Then redlining kept us
from buyin' anything,

15:20.816 --> 15:23.993
and now we gettin' pushed out
by new white money

15:24.080 --> 15:26.038
and generational
old white money

15:26.169 --> 15:27.997
as if we never existed.

15:28.127 --> 15:32.262
So this whole conversation
is some Black privilege.

15:32.393 --> 15:34.046
And I love it.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.353
So keep on havin' it.

15:36.484 --> 15:38.224
And you're welcome.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.401
And now I'm late for my date
with a Chinese man,

15:40.531 --> 15:42.316
so progress.

15:42.446 --> 15:44.056
And good night.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.102
And y'all show Sean The Wiz

15:46.232 --> 15:48.191
and The Five Heartbeats,
motherfuckers.

15:49.584 --> 15:50.976
-Bye.
-[Janelle] Y'all.

15:51.107 --> 15:52.195
Wait, y'all, y'all, y'all,
for real.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.675
I got one more question.

15:53.805 --> 15:54.850
I got one more question, y'all.

15:54.980 --> 15:55.938
[Earl] What's up?

15:56.068 --> 15:57.592
[Janelle] What?

15:57.679 --> 15:59.768
Do I look like Doja Cat?

15:59.898 --> 16:02.553
-[Janelle] Okay, bitch, listen.
-[meows]

16:02.684 --> 16:05.295
-I can't tell him the truth.
-Nope.

16:05.426 --> 16:07.253
He's gonna hate you
for not bein' there.

16:07.384 --> 16:10.909
You're probably already so mad
at me for what happened.

16:10.996 --> 16:13.129
It's all I think about.

16:13.259 --> 16:14.957
You must be...

16:15.087 --> 16:17.568
you must be
fuckin' furious with me, right?

16:17.699 --> 16:20.049
Somewhere, hate me sometimes?

16:20.136 --> 16:21.659
Maybe.

16:21.790 --> 16:23.748
But I do always say...

16:23.879 --> 16:25.315
[both] I'm a grown man.

16:25.446 --> 16:27.448
I make my own decisions
in the end.

16:27.535 --> 16:29.711
-There it is.
-Yeah, well...

16:29.841 --> 16:33.062
I hope that philosophy of yours
is still holding strong.

16:33.149 --> 16:35.325
And maybe you're scared
to tell Sean, too,

16:35.456 --> 16:37.762
and that's why you haven't been
as pushy as I expect you
