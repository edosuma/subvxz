WEBVTT

00:10.371 --> 00:14.141
I did not know what kind of
hell I was in store for.

00:14.142 --> 00:16.309
Is there really something
going on in this apartment?

00:16.309 --> 00:17.911
Where are they?

00:17.912 --> 00:21.248
She thought I was the one
doing it, but I wasn't.

00:21.249 --> 00:22.249
[Gasps]

00:22.250 --> 00:24.148
- Mommy, it's your friend.
- What friend?

00:24.149 --> 00:27.387
I don't know what she's talking about.

00:27.388 --> 00:29.689
Why am I dreaming such weird things?

00:29.690 --> 00:31.850
[Screams]

00:33.261 --> 00:35.628
Why can't I get out of this dream?

00:35.629 --> 00:36.629
[Screams]

00:36.630 --> 00:37.798
I saw the fright in her eyes.

00:37.799 --> 00:39.499
Open the door!

00:39.500 --> 00:41.201
[Screams]

00:41.202 --> 00:42.202
Stay awake.

00:42.203 --> 00:43.804
Just stay awake.

00:54.682 --> 00:57.322
[Haunting music]

01:07.461 --> 01:13.361
Back in 1999, I was a single mom
with a daughter named Hannah.

01:13.935 --> 01:17.237
I decided to move to Chico, California.

01:17.238 --> 01:19.172
Toy: Great! You're here!

01:19.173 --> 01:20.373
[Both chuckle]

01:20.374 --> 01:23.910
I felt it would be a really great
place to raise my daughter.

01:23.911 --> 01:28.915
And I also had some friends
that lived in Chico as well.

01:28.916 --> 01:30.250
Hi. You remember Hannah, right?

01:30.251 --> 01:31.251
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

01:31.252 --> 01:32.252
Go say hi.

01:32.253 --> 01:33.486
Hi, guys.

01:33.487 --> 01:36.556
And she was having just way
too many problems in Montana,

01:36.557 --> 01:40.577
and I kept on asking her to come.

01:41.095 --> 01:42.329
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:42.330 --> 01:43.435
Hi.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.670
And when she finally made it,
we were so excited, you know?

01:45.671 --> 01:46.975
- Let me just pay the..
- Oh, no, no, no.

01:46.976 --> 01:47.711
I got it. I got it.

01:47.712 --> 01:48.675
- Okay.
- How much?

01:48.676 --> 01:50.536
80 bucks.

01:50.537 --> 01:51.872
There you go.

01:51.873 --> 01:53.772
I was really low on money.

01:53.773 --> 01:58.849
I needed to find an apartment
reasonable in price.

02:07.989 --> 02:10.402
Oh, and this is the
apartment right up here.

02:10.404 --> 02:14.727
There was an apartment available,
apartment number 14.

02:14.728 --> 02:16.662
Don't you have an apartment
on the ground floor?

02:16.663 --> 02:18.265
I'd really rather prefer that.

02:18.266 --> 02:23.666
I'm showing you the only
apartment we have available.

02:25.362 --> 02:28.054
But I have a little girl.
It really doesn't look safe up there.

02:28.055 --> 02:29.671
It's perfectly safe here.

02:29.672 --> 02:32.307
We've got lots of children here.

02:32.308 --> 02:34.676
Never lost one yet, as far as I've heard.

02:34.677 --> 02:36.311
I had a daughter, and the thought

02:36.312 --> 02:39.380
of her accidentally falling
kind of scared me.

02:39.381 --> 02:41.115
This is what I'll do for you.

02:41.116 --> 02:45.620
She mentioned that as soon as a downstairs
apartment would come available,

02:45.621 --> 02:48.289
that I would be able to
move into that apartment.

02:48.290 --> 02:50.291
I do really like the place.

02:50.292 --> 02:52.393
Is the railing secure?

02:52.394 --> 02:55.330
I was strapped for cash,
and I didn't have any...

02:55.331 --> 02:57.532
A whole lot of savings.

02:57.533 --> 02:58.566
Okay.

02:58.567 --> 03:02.887
So I decided to go ahead and take it.

03:03.372 --> 03:06.539
The day I signed the rental agreement...

03:06.540 --> 03:10.878
I had no idea my life was gonna
turn into a living hell.

03:10.879 --> 03:12.847
Toy: Now let's play the game.

03:12.848 --> 03:14.948
[Laughs]

03:23.225 --> 03:25.727
You cannot come out here on your own.
It's not safe.

03:25.728 --> 03:27.413
Look at those people over there, mom.
They're waving.

03:27.414 --> 03:30.331
I was feeling a little bit anxious

03:30.332 --> 03:33.501
that I'm starting a new
life with my daughter.

03:33.502 --> 03:36.377
The first night in apartment 14...

03:36.378 --> 03:39.858
I had a terrible nightmare.

03:41.380 --> 03:42.977
[Screams]

03:42.978 --> 03:45.597
I witnessed a couple...

03:45.598 --> 03:50.338
With clothing people
would wear in the '70s.

03:50.586 --> 03:52.920
There was a predatory nature to the dream.

03:52.921 --> 03:54.121
[Children laughing]

03:54.122 --> 03:57.962
They were searching for somebody.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.980
This was so real.

04:01.497 --> 04:06.567
I felt like I was a ghost to
them, like they couldn't see me.

04:06.568 --> 04:10.048
I kept seeing a large "H".

04:10.339 --> 04:11.972
Who are these people?

04:11.973 --> 04:15.573
Why are they hunting someone?

04:15.678 --> 04:17.718
Hannah.

04:18.781 --> 04:23.233
This was unlike any other
dreams that I had had before.

04:23.234 --> 04:24.248
I was so scared.

04:24.249 --> 04:28.629
I thought that they were actually there.

04:30.225 --> 04:33.105
It was frightening.

04:34.297 --> 04:38.351
To calm myself down, I called Idie.

04:38.352 --> 04:41.336
[Phone rings] I was kind of half asleep.

04:41.337 --> 04:43.137
At first, I thought, there's an emergency.

04:43.138 --> 04:44.772
I mean, my mom, my family, something.

04:44.773 --> 04:46.607
Hello? Â¿Que esta pasando?

04:46.608 --> 04:49.477
And she's like... What's going on?
Why are you calling me?

04:49.478 --> 04:52.413
Did something happen to Hannah?
You know, is she sick?

04:52.414 --> 04:55.149
And I'm like... Idie, I'm freaking out.

04:55.150 --> 04:58.252
There was a couple, and they
came for Hannah, and I wasn't...

04:58.253 --> 04:59.554
Okay, whoa, whoa.

04:59.555 --> 05:01.922
Uh, if someone's there, you
need to call the cops.

05:01.923 --> 05:03.991
No, I was having a dream.

05:03.992 --> 05:07.705
This is about a dream?
You know, come on, Jodi. Give me a break.

05:07.706 --> 05:09.597
She was kind of angry with me.

05:09.598 --> 05:11.265
Jodi, do you have any idea what time it is?

05:11.266 --> 05:13.067
No. I'm sorry.

05:13.068 --> 05:14.888
She rationalized it with me saying...

05:14.889 --> 05:19.507
Jodi, nightmares sometimes
happen when you're stressed out.

05:19.508 --> 05:21.075
My subconscious was working out

05:21.076 --> 05:24.645
some sort of irrational fear
about Hannah being hurt.

05:24.646 --> 05:27.286
[Birds chirping]

05:27.783 --> 05:28.883
Hold on.

05:28.884 --> 05:31.352
Keep going. You're gonna fall off.

05:31.353 --> 05:35.556
The next day, it was sunny
out, so it was nice.

05:35.557 --> 05:39.326
I just try to forget the dream
and forget the incident

05:39.327 --> 05:42.329
and just go on with life
as normal as possible.

05:42.330 --> 05:43.598
[Laughs]

05:43.599 --> 05:48.159
Close in the middle. Just touch your head.

05:50.105 --> 05:55.025
But I had another dream
about the same couple.

05:57.279 --> 05:58.579
[Electricity buzzes]

05:58.580 --> 06:03.680
They walked down the hallway
towards my apartment.

06:04.620 --> 06:08.640
Everything seemed so intensely real.

06:08.657 --> 06:12.917
I felt utterly vulnerable and helpless.

06:13.194 --> 06:18.295
Look at those people over there, mom.
They're waving.

06:18.296 --> 06:20.816
That couple...

06:21.063 --> 06:24.303
They emanated pure evil.

06:24.339 --> 06:29.139
I'm a mom, and I couldn't help my daughter.

06:32.147 --> 06:33.295
All of a sudden, I just saw...

06:33.296 --> 06:34.416
[Whispers] Help me.

06:34.417 --> 06:37.717
This poor, innocent girl.

06:37.753 --> 06:42.373
I screamed... "Stop. Don't take this girl!"

06:44.259 --> 06:48.228
I wake up at 3:37 in the morning again.

06:48.229 --> 06:51.065
My heart was pounding really fast.

06:51.066 --> 06:54.635
I was actually having a panic attack.

06:54.636 --> 06:59.976
I felt like I needed to get
a neighbor or somebody.

07:00.375 --> 07:01.375
No answer.

07:01.376 --> 07:03.277
Please open the door!

07:03.278 --> 07:09.098
I was feeling really alone,
really frightened, really scared.

07:12.855 --> 07:14.989
Jodi, there's nobody there.
There's nobody there.

07:14.990 --> 07:16.491
It's fine. You're okay.

07:16.492 --> 07:18.532
[Sighs]

07:18.727 --> 07:21.367
[Birds chirping]

07:22.297 --> 07:26.000
The complex manager told me
that there was going to be

07:26.001 --> 07:29.504
a downstairs apartment available.

07:29.505 --> 07:30.893
I felt relieved.

07:30.894 --> 07:32.414
It has a playground and everything.

07:32.415 --> 07:33.343
Hannah would feel safe.

07:33.344 --> 07:37.806
I wouldn't be always thinking she
was gonna fall over the balcony.

07:37.807 --> 07:42.182
This is gonna stop my nightmares,
and everything should be fine.

07:42.183 --> 07:43.851
Could be worse.

07:43.852 --> 07:45.520
[Chuckles]

07:45.521 --> 07:47.388
Really?

07:47.389 --> 07:50.224
I didn't care if the apartment was dirty.

07:50.225 --> 07:54.161
I just wanted to get out
of apartment number 14.

07:54.162 --> 07:57.822
I had this really weird vibe.

07:58.534 --> 08:01.954
I just felt this coldness.

08:03.739 --> 08:07.399
I felt a presence of someone.

08:08.510 --> 08:13.430
I actually thought that
someone just passed me.

08:17.185 --> 08:20.841
I felt nauseous in the apartment,

08:20.842 --> 08:23.691
but then I was pregnant.

08:23.692 --> 08:28.655
So I was kind of like, am I
getting morning sickness?

08:28.656 --> 08:34.034
Or is there really something
going on in this apartment?

08:34.035 --> 08:35.937
It's not so bad, Idie.

08:35.938 --> 08:38.673
A coat of paint, maybe some new carpet.

08:38.674 --> 08:41.506
I didn't want to tell Jodi, because
I didn't want to freak her out.

08:41.508 --> 08:47.088
I didn't want to make her
scared in the new apartment.

08:54.327 --> 08:58.429
As I moved in 23, I thought it was my
home, that I would be there for a while.

08:58.430 --> 09:00.795
Today, when you were at school...

09:00.796 --> 09:03.497
In Hannah's bedroom, we
made it really cozy.

09:03.498 --> 09:07.034
Of course, she's a little girl, so she
wanted everything pink, pink and white.

09:07.035 --> 09:08.302
[Chuckles]

09:08.303 --> 09:09.737
- You want to see it?
- Yeah.

09:09.738 --> 09:11.438
Surprise.

09:11.439 --> 09:14.709
She slept with me, so basically,
it was a toy room with clothes.

09:14.710 --> 09:16.343
What do you think?

09:16.344 --> 09:19.647
Wow, it's good, but, mom,
you got all the toys wrong.

09:19.648 --> 09:20.585
What do you mean?

09:20.586 --> 09:25.252
Hannah's favorite toy was a Sesame
Street Sleep and Snore Ernie doll.

09:25.253 --> 09:27.287
Toy: I feel great.
- Because Ernie's always there.

09:27.288 --> 09:31.058
It had a really special place
on top of her dresser.

09:31.059 --> 09:33.114
You got your very own drawing table.

09:33.115 --> 09:37.632
It wasn't very long after
we moved into apartment 23

09:37.633 --> 09:40.367
that strange things started happening.

09:40.368 --> 09:41.936
Where are my keys?

09:41.937 --> 09:46.440
I was very particular about having
things handy and ready to go.

09:46.441 --> 09:48.609
Hannah, have you seen my keys?
They're not on the hook.

09:48.610 --> 09:52.330
No, mom. I haven't seen them.

09:54.049 --> 09:55.582
What? What? Did I do that?

09:55.583 --> 09:56.408
[Chuckles]

09:56.409 --> 09:59.831
Why would I leave the keys
in the middle of the bed?

09:59.832 --> 10:02.189
Why would I do that?

10:02.190 --> 10:04.792
I just thought, it must be Hannah.

10:04.793 --> 10:07.795
Hannah's probably moving things
around because she's a little kid.

10:07.796 --> 10:09.836
Hannah?

10:09.965 --> 10:11.732
Hannah, my keys were in
the middle of the bed.

10:11.733 --> 10:13.868
Did you put them there
as some sort of joke?

10:13.869 --> 10:15.435
What type of joke would that be?

10:15.436 --> 10:17.571
I remember my mom getting,
like, really mad at me,

10:17.572 --> 10:20.174
because she thought I was the
one moving all her stuff.

10:20.175 --> 10:23.187
Hannah, do you understand that everything
needs to be put back in its place?

10:23.188 --> 10:24.879
I didn't touch your keys, okay, mom?

10:24.880 --> 10:27.982
But she just, like, kept getting
mad at me and, like, upset.

10:27.983 --> 10:30.350
She's like, you, like...
"You can't touch my stuff."

10:30.351 --> 10:32.053
- Hannah, are you lying to me?
- No, mom.

10:32.054 --> 10:35.856
Why would I lie about some stupid keys?

10:35.857 --> 10:38.993
She looked like she was gonna
cry, because I was yelling.

10:38.994 --> 10:41.348
I was mad at her, because I thought,
you know, she's a little kid.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.289
She's lying to me.

10:49.238 --> 10:52.238
I didn't understand.

10:53.775 --> 10:55.815
[Sighs]

10:56.444 --> 11:02.344
I didn't understand what was going
on and why I'm seeing this happen.

11:03.384 --> 11:05.724
And then...

11:05.987 --> 11:10.547
I had another dream about the same couple.

11:12.060 --> 11:14.476
And it's another one of those real

11:14.477 --> 11:18.737
dreams like I had up in apartment 14.

11:19.877 --> 11:23.503
This time, they were driving a blue car.

11:23.504 --> 11:28.364
They had driven by a
girl who I saw walking.

11:28.476 --> 11:30.711
Hey, honey. You need a ride?

11:30.712 --> 11:31.712
No, thank you.

11:31.713 --> 11:33.247
You're so pretty.

11:33.248 --> 11:34.648
Let's go.

11:34.649 --> 11:36.951
Where do you live?

11:36.952 --> 11:41.122
That was the exact same girl that
I had been dreaming about before.

11:41.123 --> 11:43.758
We've got a friend that lives over there...

11:43.759 --> 11:48.199
Are you sure we can't give you a ride?

11:49.231 --> 11:53.467
I wanted to tell her...
"No, don't get in that car".

11:53.468 --> 11:56.536
Don't worry. We won't bite.

11:56.537 --> 11:58.072
I could hear them chatter.

11:58.073 --> 11:59.140
I'm Janice.

11:59.141 --> 12:00.407
Nice to meet you. I'm Marliz.

12:00.408 --> 12:01.708
Marliz?

12:01.709 --> 12:04.207
Yeah, my name's Marie, but
people call me Marliz.

12:04.208 --> 12:06.847
Ooh, that's fun. [Both chuckle]

12:06.848 --> 12:07.982
This is Cameron, my husband.

12:07.983 --> 12:09.383
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

12:09.384 --> 12:10.818
How long have you guys been married?

12:10.819 --> 12:12.419
What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?

12:12.420 --> 12:14.822
Yeah, I do, but we just had a fight.

12:14.823 --> 12:16.456
Oh, that's terrible.

12:16.457 --> 12:17.925
Should we go pick him up?

12:17.926 --> 12:20.239
Oh, no, that's fine.
He can just... He can cool off.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.495
But you've got someone at home, right?

12:21.496 --> 12:22.797
If you're upset? A roommate?

12:22.798 --> 12:24.899
No, no, I don't, but that's fine, though.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.120
[Chuckles]

12:29.737 --> 12:35.557
And all of a sudden, they speed
off over onto the freeway.

12:38.546 --> 12:43.550
They were driving down a
neighborhood street in Chico.

12:43.551 --> 12:46.503
I recognized it right away.

12:46.504 --> 12:49.384
This is my street.

12:55.063 --> 13:00.201
When they pulled up to my
apartment complex, I was scared.

13:00.202 --> 13:01.836
Well, I could use a pit stop.

13:01.837 --> 13:05.257
"Can I use your restroom?"

13:08.405 --> 13:12.545
I could see the evil in their face.

13:12.647 --> 13:15.923
I didn't know what to do.

13:15.924 --> 13:17.392
[Gasps]

13:17.393 --> 13:20.654
Why am I dreaming such weird things?

13:20.655 --> 13:23.490
That's what happened in
the previous apartment.

13:23.491 --> 13:26.350
Why am I waking up at 3:37 in the morning?

13:26.351 --> 13:29.111
I don't get it.

13:42.266 --> 13:45.086
[Breathing heavily]

13:45.228 --> 13:49.464
These dreams took a real
physical toll on me.

13:49.465 --> 13:52.871
I was exhausted.
I felt like I hadn't gotten any sleep.

13:52.872 --> 13:55.106
I do remember my mom being
pretty stressed out,

13:55.107 --> 13:58.276
because, like, I think she's
been having experiences herself,

13:58.277 --> 13:59.978
but she didn't want to believe it.

13:59.979 --> 14:02.347
Here's your coat. Put this on.

14:02.348 --> 14:03.849
Hannah, where are your shoes?

14:03.850 --> 14:08.386
Hannah had a pair of
little pink slip on shoes.

14:08.387 --> 14:09.464
We always keep our shoes by the door.

14:09.465 --> 14:10.947
- Where did you put them?
- I don't know.

14:10.948 --> 14:12.115
Hannah, don't play with me.

14:12.116 --> 14:15.268
If you want to go outside and play,
then we got to find your shoes.

14:15.269 --> 14:16.569
Hannah, where did you put them?

14:16.570 --> 14:17.704
- Where are they?
- I didn't...

14:17.705 --> 14:19.539
Just tell me where they are right now.

14:19.540 --> 14:21.651
She thought I was the one
doing it, but I wasn't.

14:21.652 --> 14:22.706
I didn't move them.

14:22.707 --> 14:24.156
Hannah, I don't have time for this.

14:24.157 --> 14:26.158
- Where are they?
- I didn't move them.

14:26.159 --> 14:30.129
Hannah, come on, this is the
last time I'm gonna do this.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.860
Right smack dab in front
of me, there they are.

14:32.861 --> 14:35.689
Hannah, what is on the bed?

14:35.690 --> 14:36.756
My shoes?

14:36.757 --> 14:38.202
Did you put the shoes on the bed?

14:38.203 --> 14:39.014
No, I didn't touch the shoes.

14:39.015 --> 14:41.065
Hannah, don't lie to me.
I'm not gonna stand for it.

14:41.066 --> 14:42.366
- Stop!
- I'm sorry.

14:42.367 --> 14:44.664
It was upsetting to see
my mom, like, so upset.

14:44.665 --> 14:47.933
I'm sorry. You're right.

14:47.934 --> 14:50.539
Hannah, did you see mommy
put the shoes on the bed?

14:50.540 --> 14:52.340
No.

14:52.909 --> 14:57.012
I started to think maybe
I was losing my mind.

14:57.013 --> 15:01.314
I felt like I just had to
get out of the apartment.

15:01.315 --> 15:06.475
I just wanted to pretend
like everything was fine.

15:08.858 --> 15:09.858
[Tires screech]

15:09.859 --> 15:12.061
You're crazy! What's your problem?

15:12.062 --> 15:15.175
I was so overwhelmed with, like, anxiety.

15:15.176 --> 15:18.056
Hey! Hey, gorgeous.

15:19.069 --> 15:21.075
I wanted to feel safe.

15:21.076 --> 15:24.916
I did not want to go to sleep.

15:25.521 --> 15:30.921
I really felt an overwhelming
sense of impending doom.

15:33.984 --> 15:38.186
They walked up to my apartment,
apartment number 14.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.955
This is a really great place you got here.

15:39.956 --> 15:41.056
Oh, thank you.

15:41.057 --> 15:42.691
I just actually moved in recently, so...

15:42.692 --> 15:48.097
I see the man put a couple drops of
something from the little bottle

15:48.098 --> 15:50.733
on this handkerchief.

15:50.734 --> 15:53.815
[Sighs] Like, why am I...

15:53.816 --> 15:56.363
Why am I seeing all this stuff?
I didn't get it.

15:56.364 --> 15:59.742
Yeah, I actually work
down at this photo shop.

15:59.743 --> 16:05.643
And then it's almost like I was
remembering the other dream.

16:08.417 --> 16:09.484
Get out! Get out!

16:09.485 --> 16:11.765
[Screaming]

16:16.059 --> 16:18.200
They picked her up together and

16:18.201 --> 16:21.741
walked her over to the car.

16:22.132 --> 16:28.032
If someone had seen her, she might have
just looked like a drunk college kid.

16:31.741 --> 16:34.561
[Breathing heavily]

16:34.878 --> 16:39.648
It scared me because it seemed
like it was happening for real,

16:39.649 --> 16:44.869
like I was really seeing
somebody being taken away.

16:46.156 --> 16:51.256
I was trying to rationalize
it again in my mind.

16:51.795 --> 16:54.997
But there were also things
I couldn't explain,

16:54.998 --> 16:58.400
the strange occurrences in the house.

16:58.401 --> 17:01.737
It started out with small
things, moving keys,

17:01.738 --> 17:05.593
remote controls being moved into the
bathroom, and then it ended up being...

17:05.594 --> 17:08.542
Like, dining room chairs would move.

17:08.544 --> 17:12.414
None of this made any
sense whatsoever to me.

17:12.415 --> 17:16.531
I really started to think
that if it wasn't Hannah...

17:16.532 --> 17:19.233
That it was me.

17:20.123 --> 17:22.858
That I was doing these things.

17:22.858 --> 17:27.395
I wanted to get to the bottom of it and
figure out what's really going on here.

17:27.396 --> 17:29.865
She thought, like, there was
people in her house or something,

17:29.866 --> 17:32.868
you know, people moving her
stuff, because it wasn't me.

17:32.869 --> 17:37.669
Maybe someone was trying
to get my attention.

17:38.507 --> 17:41.948
But I didn't know if it was
a person in the complex.

17:41.949 --> 17:44.949
I just didn't know.

17:45.039 --> 17:47.216
I thought about leaving the apartment.

17:47.217 --> 17:50.706
However, I just didn't
have enough money to move.

17:50.707 --> 17:53.021
I didn't have a job yet.

17:53.022 --> 17:56.082
I had to stay there.

17:57.160 --> 18:01.730
I was really tired, and I was
afraid to go back to sleep,

18:01.731 --> 18:06.201
because I didn't want
to have another dream.

18:06.202 --> 18:10.522
I thought, stay awake. Just stay awake.

18:13.076 --> 18:14.309
Oh, God.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.879
- Shut up. - [Crying]

18:16.880 --> 18:20.582
In the dream, I was back with that
couple again in the blue car.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.584
Where are you taking me?

18:22.585 --> 18:24.925
Let me go!

18:26.422 --> 18:28.762
Oh, please!

18:29.358 --> 18:31.306
Please, I'm... Let me go.

18:31.307 --> 18:35.267
And he pulls out this contraption.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.433
What is that?

18:38.434 --> 18:39.634
- No!
- Get her head.

18:39.635 --> 18:40.869
[Screams]

18:40.870 --> 18:43.672
He rammed this thing over her head.

18:43.673 --> 18:46.341
Gonna be quiet now?

18:46.342 --> 18:51.083
To see such fear and terror on her
face scared the hell out of me.

18:51.084 --> 18:53.448
[Engine turns over]

18:53.449 --> 18:55.969
[Engine roars]

18:57.153 --> 19:01.323
This wasn't some random act of violence.

19:01.324 --> 19:03.225
They had this all planned out.

19:03.226 --> 19:04.827
[Upbeat rock music]

19:04.828 --> 19:06.988
[Gasping]

19:07.630 --> 19:09.264
I felt suffocated.

19:09.265 --> 19:11.266
I got to get out of here.
Please, I want to wake up.

19:11.267 --> 19:15.527
And I couldn't. I could not wake up.

19:15.705 --> 19:21.605
I didn't know where I was, where they
were, but it seemed like their home.

19:24.613 --> 19:26.562
[Gasping]

19:26.563 --> 19:32.323
I'm seeing weird stuff, like,
something with chains on it.

19:32.507 --> 19:34.366
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Shh.

19:34.367 --> 19:37.492
Whatever this is, I don't want to see it.

19:37.493 --> 19:38.593
[Wood creaking]

19:38.594 --> 19:40.295
[Chains jangle]

19:40.296 --> 19:42.415
She was hung like this.

19:42.416 --> 19:45.236
I'll do anything.

19:45.268 --> 19:46.434
Please, let me go.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.238
To be in a dream and witnessing it...

19:49.239 --> 19:50.805
Please let me go! Let me go!

19:50.806 --> 19:53.751
And feeling like I want to
do something, but I can't...

19:53.752 --> 19:56.632
Is heart wrenching.

19:57.480 --> 20:02.684
They started to touch her, like, in a
disgusting, evil, sexual kind of way.

20:02.685 --> 20:04.887
Stop. No!

20:04.888 --> 20:06.721
Please don't!

20:06.722 --> 20:08.877
My parents have money.
They can give you anything.

20:08.878 --> 20:11.593
Please, let me go. Please, no!

20:11.594 --> 20:14.329
Please let me go!

20:14.330 --> 20:16.531
[Speaking indistinctly]

20:16.532 --> 20:21.692
The woman just put her
mouth on her and bit her.

20:27.809 --> 20:31.113
And her eyes just conveyed...

20:31.114 --> 20:33.754
Please help me.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.885
And I couldn't. I didn't know what to do.

20:36.886 --> 20:39.788
I was just a ghost in a dream.

20:39.789 --> 20:41.056
[Distorted voice] Wake up.

20:41.057 --> 20:43.697
Mommy, wake up.

20:44.193 --> 20:46.353
[Gasping]

20:57.567 --> 20:58.867
[Gasps] No!

20:58.868 --> 21:00.035
[Distorted voice] Wake up.

21:00.036 --> 21:02.676
Mommy, wake up.

21:02.940 --> 21:05.760
[Breathing heavily]

21:07.010 --> 21:08.507
Are you okay?

21:08.508 --> 21:11.910
It's the most horrifying...

21:11.911 --> 21:15.151
Disgusting thing to see,

21:15.739 --> 21:17.519
another human being

21:17.520 --> 21:20.430
torture someone like that.

21:20.431 --> 21:22.024
That's someone's baby.

21:22.025 --> 21:24.993
That's someone's child.

21:24.994 --> 21:26.796
[Chuckles]

21:26.797 --> 21:30.199
What if that happened to Hannah?

21:30.200 --> 21:33.468
I couldn't take another thing happening.

21:33.469 --> 21:35.604
- Hold still.
- Ow. Ow.

21:35.605 --> 21:38.254
- Mommy, look.
- What?

21:38.255 --> 21:40.907
- Mommy, it's your friend.
- What friend?

21:40.908 --> 21:42.307
I don't know what she's talking about.

21:42.308 --> 21:44.613
- There's nobody here.
- She's right there.

21:44.614 --> 21:47.674
I look around, and...

21:48.684 --> 21:50.664
Where?

21:51.487 --> 21:53.388
Maybe you scared her away.

21:53.389 --> 21:55.624
Now here my child's seeing things.

21:55.625 --> 21:58.426
Hannah? Hannah, I can't
take this right now.

21:58.427 --> 21:59.979
Don't make things up, okay?
Stop playing games.

21:59.980 --> 22:02.564
- Don't play games with mommy.
- Mom, I didn't make this up.

22:02.565 --> 22:05.505
Okay, come with me.

22:06.502 --> 22:10.072
That night, I had another dream.

22:10.073 --> 22:12.107
The girl was in the bathroom.

22:12.108 --> 22:13.608
- Let me go.
- Shh.

22:13.609 --> 22:16.311
Please, you have to let me go.
I can't stay here.

22:16.312 --> 22:17.794
I have to go home.

22:17.795 --> 22:19.882
She kept begging for her life.
Please let me go.

22:19.883 --> 22:21.349
She was pleading at this point.

22:21.350 --> 22:23.652
Oh, my God. [Sobbing]

22:23.653 --> 22:26.521
If you don't shut up,
he's gonna come in here!

22:26.522 --> 22:29.342
Will you shut up?

22:29.458 --> 22:33.958
And I see him take the knife and just...

22:34.336 --> 22:36.574
Like, pull her neck back like this

22:36.575 --> 22:39.875
and then just... [Grunts]

22:46.742 --> 22:50.282
I'm so scared and startled.

22:51.047 --> 22:53.148
Please help me.

22:53.149 --> 22:57.986
Her eyes meet my eyes, and
right then, I knew she saw me.

22:57.987 --> 23:01.423
I knew she saw me. I saw her. She saw me.

23:01.424 --> 23:04.026
Help me, please.

23:04.027 --> 23:06.463
And then, all of a sudden, she was gone.

23:06.464 --> 23:07.340
[Gasping]

23:07.341 --> 23:11.033
3:37 in the morning, the mini blinds...

23:11.034 --> 23:13.001
They shoot up on their own.

23:13.002 --> 23:17.562
The lights start flashing in the apartment.

23:25.114 --> 23:27.328
Pssht! The TV turns on.

23:27.329 --> 23:29.117
White static noise.

23:29.118 --> 23:30.252
Toy: Now let's play the game.

23:30.253 --> 23:34.289
Sleep and Snore Ernie doll is in the
center of the living room screaming.

23:34.290 --> 23:35.958
Toy: Now let's play the game.

23:35.959 --> 23:37.559
Let's play the game. Let's play the game.

23:37.560 --> 23:40.495
I was so overwhelmed, and I
couldn't take it any more.

23:40.496 --> 23:43.016
[Toy laughing]

23:44.800 --> 23:46.401
At that point, I didn't want to be alone.

23:46.402 --> 23:49.424
I was afraid now after
having the nightmares and

23:49.425 --> 23:51.740
having the strange occurrences
happen in the house.

23:51.741 --> 23:56.311
[Both laugh] I missed you.
Oh, you look beautiful, Misty.

23:56.312 --> 23:57.545
Misty's a special girl.

23:57.546 --> 24:00.546
She's actually deaf.

24:00.816 --> 24:01.816
Seriously?

24:01.817 --> 24:05.053
I had known Misty for many
years, and I trusted her.

24:05.054 --> 24:06.654
She was a family friend.

24:06.655 --> 24:08.635
Exams.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.199
Hannah?

24:17.200 --> 24:18.666
I don't... I don't... I don't know.

24:18.667 --> 24:19.667
[Chuckles]

24:19.668 --> 24:21.136
I wanted to have someone there.

24:21.137 --> 24:23.138
Both: Surprise!

24:23.139 --> 24:28.210
I was hoping that it would all stop,
that I could chalk it all up to stress,

24:28.211 --> 24:31.871
but that's not what happened.

24:38.354 --> 24:41.390
Oh, Misty, I'm sorry.
Have you been waiting a long time?

24:41.391 --> 24:44.871
Ah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

24:56.108 --> 24:57.839
Toy: I feel great.

24:57.840 --> 24:59.707
I hear Hannah's Ernie doll.

24:59.708 --> 25:05.228
Hannah, stop. Hannah, stop.
I feel great. I feel great.

25:06.816 --> 25:09.151
- Stay here.
- Toy: I feel great.

25:09.152 --> 25:12.120
- I'm really anxious...
- Toy: I feel great.

25:12.121 --> 25:14.056
But I don't want to scare
these little kids.

25:14.057 --> 25:16.258
Toy: I feel great. I feel great.

25:16.259 --> 25:18.560
I feel great. I feel great.

25:18.561 --> 25:20.762
I feel great. I feel great.

25:20.763 --> 25:23.000
I feel great.

25:23.001 --> 25:24.009
[Gasps]

25:24.010 --> 25:27.102
Ernie has a noose around his neck.

25:27.103 --> 25:28.401
- Stay here.
- What happened to Ernie?

25:28.402 --> 25:30.872
She's signing to me, what is that?

25:30.873 --> 25:34.176
I don't know.
Nobody has the keys.

25:34.177 --> 25:36.744
This is the first time I say,
let's call the police.

25:36.745 --> 25:40.282
At this point, I'm thinking,
Misty witnessed something.

25:40.283 --> 25:43.856
Hannah's talking about an imaginary friend.

25:43.857 --> 25:46.054
Something is just not right here.

25:46.055 --> 25:49.264
Somebody broke in.
I checked the windows and the doors,

25:49.265 --> 25:51.093
but there's no sign
of a break-in.

25:51.094 --> 25:53.561
But could you just send somebody?
We're very upset over here.

25:53.562 --> 25:55.530
- Is anything missing, ma'am?
- No.

25:55.531 --> 25:59.167
Has anything been moved since
you discovered the crime scene?

25:59.168 --> 26:01.636
No... Yes. No.

26:01.637 --> 26:05.991
I see. So it all looks pretty much the
same as a normal little girl's tidy room.

26:05.992 --> 26:07.680
Yes, except for the fact
that there's an Ernie

26:07.681 --> 26:11.761
doll with a noose
around his neck.

26:11.799 --> 26:15.050
Well, tell me, has Bert been
acting suspicious lately?

26:15.051 --> 26:17.744
Or Elmo? Do you think it
could have been Elmo?

26:17.745 --> 26:20.122
He just thought that I was
some sort of a nutcase

26:20.123 --> 26:22.457
that needed to have some
sort of police attention.

26:22.458 --> 26:24.159
This is a busy town, lady.

26:24.160 --> 26:29.860
Now who am I gonna call if
something weird happens again?

26:30.099 --> 26:33.668
Misty had a school event
early in the morning.

26:33.669 --> 26:38.349
She needed to be at the bus stop at 6:00.

26:42.511 --> 26:48.031
None of us wanted to be alone,
because we were scared.

26:51.354 --> 26:53.514
[Gasping]

26:54.123 --> 26:55.723
Help me.

26:55.724 --> 26:57.092
[Sobbing]

26:57.093 --> 26:58.797
Please.

26:58.798 --> 27:00.838
[Gasps]

27:12.379 --> 27:16.382
We made sure that the
clocks were set for 5:30

27:16.383 --> 27:21.423
so that she could be at
the bus stop by 6:00.

27:25.691 --> 27:27.851
[Gasping]

27:28.322 --> 27:30.482
Help me.

27:30.752 --> 27:32.218
Please.

27:32.219 --> 27:34.259
[Gasps]

27:40.873 --> 27:45.187
I look over, and I see the time,
and it says 6:00 in the morning.

27:45.188 --> 27:46.552
We're already late.

27:46.553 --> 27:47.968
Everything's going crazy.

27:47.969 --> 27:50.003
[Crying]

27:50.004 --> 27:51.705
I'm like, is this a dream?

27:51.706 --> 27:54.340
Am I in a dream?

27:54.341 --> 27:56.176
Why can't I get out of this dream?

27:56.177 --> 27:57.544
[Screams]

27:57.545 --> 28:00.346
The Ernie doll was going off saying,
I feel great. I feel great.

28:00.347 --> 28:01.347
I feel great.

28:01.348 --> 28:04.584
Toy: I feel great. I feel great.

28:04.585 --> 28:08.188
- [Screams] - I was like, what?

28:08.189 --> 28:11.069
Run. Just run. Go.

28:12.568 --> 28:15.628
3:37 in the morning.

28:17.065 --> 28:20.488
I just start... I just start
screaming at the top of my lungs.

28:20.489 --> 28:22.044
Get out of my house!

28:22.045 --> 28:23.592
Get out of my house!

28:23.593 --> 28:26.206
Whatever evil spirit's in
my house, in the name of...

28:26.207 --> 28:30.443
Jesus, get out!
It doesn't belong to you any more!

28:30.444 --> 28:33.013
I just want out of here, and
I want my child to be safe.

28:33.014 --> 28:35.130
Yeah, she's making trouble.

28:35.131 --> 28:36.131
Yeah, I see it.

28:36.132 --> 28:40.783
They offered me an apartment in a
completely different apartment complex

28:40.784 --> 28:43.320
in downtown Chico.

28:43.321 --> 28:46.656
Part of the agreement would
be that I would not talk

28:46.657 --> 28:50.137
about the haunted apartment.

28:51.829 --> 28:55.966
And I thought to myself, hey,
whatever it takes, I'm going.

28:55.967 --> 29:01.787
I just want out of here, and
I want my child to be safe.

29:05.208 --> 29:09.819
The day that I left Walnut Garden
apartment complex, my life changed.

29:09.820 --> 29:12.352
All: Three, two, one. Woo!

29:12.353 --> 29:15.018
- Catch it, Hannah!
- Hannah and I were excited.

29:15.019 --> 29:16.404
We were happy.

29:16.405 --> 29:20.390
I got a job, and I met a wonderful man.

29:20.391 --> 29:21.824
His name is Joel.

29:21.825 --> 29:24.961
My performance was quite good, but
the girls were not very good.

29:24.962 --> 29:25.962
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:25.963 --> 29:29.399
We would spend time together, and I
enjoyed, you know, the interactions

29:29.400 --> 29:31.145
that she had with my kids.

29:31.146 --> 29:32.920
All right, let's see what you can do.
Let's go. Lets go.

29:32.921 --> 29:35.426
Woo! Catch it, Hannah.

29:35.427 --> 29:40.943
Joel brought an enormous amount of
stability and happiness to my life.

29:40.944 --> 29:45.515
I wanted to put every single thing
about the haunted apartment behind me

29:45.516 --> 29:49.056
and just completely move on.

29:52.990 --> 29:55.266
Once in a while, I have a dream about her.

29:55.267 --> 29:56.634
I did not feel scared of her,

29:56.635 --> 29:58.933
because I just thought she
was one of my mom's friends,

29:58.934 --> 30:00.630
and, like, she was comforting.

30:00.631 --> 30:03.199
Both: Bake me a cake as fast as you can.

30:03.200 --> 30:07.070
I felt like I could just,
like, talk to her sometimes.

30:07.071 --> 30:10.340
She said her name was Marliz,
but I called her Myliz,

30:10.341 --> 30:11.897
because I don't think I
could pronounce that.

30:11.898 --> 30:16.578
Both: Put it in the oven for Myliz and me.

30:18.815 --> 30:21.550
What happened with your neck?

30:21.551 --> 30:24.311
Don't be scared.

30:25.185 --> 30:27.225
Please.

30:28.533 --> 30:30.573
[Gasps]

30:33.030 --> 30:34.158
She loves the water...

30:34.159 --> 30:37.367
One day, Hannah and
Idie's son were drawing.

30:37.368 --> 30:39.001
She seems to have absolutely...

30:39.002 --> 30:41.607
No, but he was the same way.
It just took a little bit.

30:41.608 --> 30:44.487
All of a sudden, I saw her picture.

30:44.488 --> 30:46.676
It was a startling image.

30:46.677 --> 30:48.545
I was kind of taken back.

30:48.546 --> 30:50.680
Hannah, what is this?

30:50.681 --> 30:52.115
Who is this girl?

30:52.116 --> 30:57.036
That's my friend, mom.
She's your friend too.

30:57.054 --> 31:00.056
Hannah, is this the girl you saw
in the mirror in the apartment?

31:00.057 --> 31:04.737
I told her, that's Myliz; That's my Angel.

31:05.862 --> 31:07.464
Hannah, what is this?

31:07.465 --> 31:09.566
That's the people that are hurting her.

31:09.567 --> 31:15.205
I just drew her hanging, I think,
and she had tears on her face.

31:15.206 --> 31:17.840
Where did you see this?

31:17.841 --> 31:21.563
I don't want my baby to experience...

31:21.564 --> 31:25.115
What I had experienced in those dreams.

31:25.116 --> 31:27.456
It's okay.

31:28.185 --> 31:31.654
Okay, why don't you get the blue crayon,
and why don't you finish that, okay?

31:31.655 --> 31:32.922
You okay?

31:32.923 --> 31:36.943
It brought everything flooding back.

31:37.928 --> 31:38.928
[Gasps]

31:38.929 --> 31:41.749
[Breathing heavily]

31:42.032 --> 31:43.433
Oh.

31:43.434 --> 31:44.967
Oh.

31:44.968 --> 31:48.004
There was a girl. She did go missing.

31:48.005 --> 31:50.272
She did go missing from my apartment.

31:50.273 --> 31:55.211
When she first told me the stories,
I didn't really know what to think.

31:55.212 --> 31:57.813
- You don't think I'm crazy, do you?
- No.

31:57.814 --> 31:59.815
- You believe me?
- Yes.

31:59.816 --> 32:01.017
[Breathing heavily]

32:01.018 --> 32:03.172
I can really see how this is affecting you.

32:03.173 --> 32:05.155
I felt that they were signs.

32:05.156 --> 32:09.025
I felt that there was a story
here that wanted to be told.

32:09.026 --> 32:10.549
And...

32:10.550 --> 32:12.561
And she was...

32:12.562 --> 32:15.244
The voice for this story.

32:15.245 --> 32:18.501
I don't need this thing following me again.

32:18.502 --> 32:20.336
So we went to the library,

32:20.337 --> 32:25.457
and we were going through old
copies of a local newspaper

32:25.458 --> 32:27.544
called the Chico Enterprise-Record.

32:27.545 --> 32:28.996
I'm gonna go check this. Be right back.

32:28.997 --> 32:31.581
I didn't even know what
we were looking for.

32:31.582 --> 32:36.396
We were hours and hours looking
and getting a little discouraged,

32:36.397 --> 32:38.054
because we weren't finding much.

32:38.055 --> 32:41.416
It's like looking for a
needle in a haystack.

32:41.417 --> 32:43.293
February 3, 1976.

32:43.294 --> 32:46.796
And Joel finally found
a teeny little article

32:46.797 --> 32:50.300
that said, local girl gone missing.

32:50.301 --> 32:52.168
Girl is missing in Chico, California.

32:52.169 --> 32:56.325
And then it says,
gone missing from...

32:56.326 --> 32:58.846
Parmac Road...

32:58.919 --> 33:01.619
Walnut Gardens...

33:01.845 --> 33:04.305
Apartment 14.

33:04.517 --> 33:08.297
The exact apartment I lived in.

33:20.519 --> 33:24.239
Right on the top was a photo.

33:25.825 --> 33:29.253
I recognized her right away.

33:29.254 --> 33:31.162
That was the girl that Hannah had seen.

33:31.163 --> 33:33.765
That was the girl I was dreaming about.

33:33.766 --> 33:37.246
Those experiences were real.

33:37.804 --> 33:40.105
There was a real missing girl.

33:40.106 --> 33:41.139
That's her.

33:41.140 --> 33:43.708
Finally, I had a name.

33:43.709 --> 33:46.349
Marie Spannhake.

33:49.715 --> 33:55.153
After seeing that article, I
started having more dreams.

33:55.154 --> 33:57.122
[Breathing heavily]

33:57.123 --> 33:59.432
I saw the couple...

33:59.433 --> 34:04.413
Putting Marie's body in
the back of their car.

34:06.964 --> 34:10.024
[Sighs] She was dead.

34:10.402 --> 34:13.197
This nagging feeling kept
telling me that, you know what?

34:13.197 --> 34:15.783
You need to listen, and
you need to follow this

34:15.784 --> 34:20.378
and investigate and see
what this is really about.

34:20.379 --> 34:21.545
And they took her back to...

34:21.545 --> 34:26.818
I made an appointment with a crime
reporter from a local newspaper.

34:26.819 --> 34:28.853
It's not particularly
unusual to have people call

34:28.853 --> 34:31.790
for information on specific criminal cases.

34:31.791 --> 34:33.158
And hung her up.

34:33.159 --> 34:35.293
She wasn't raving.

34:35.293 --> 34:39.463
She was rather matter-of-fact,
maybe a little sad.

34:39.464 --> 34:42.083
She started screaming, and
she wouldn't stop screaming.

34:42.085 --> 34:44.268
Jodi and I are looking at each
other all nervous, you know?

34:44.270 --> 34:45.303
Okay, now what?

34:45.304 --> 34:47.105
And he showed us these paper clippings.

34:47.106 --> 34:51.375
The Spannhake case was connected to a
case that had made the national news.

34:51.376 --> 34:54.978
It was called the girl in the box case.

34:54.980 --> 35:00.880
A couple, Cameron and Janice Hooker,
had kidnapped a woman in Red Bluff

35:00.886 --> 35:02.520
named Colleen Stan.

35:02.521 --> 35:06.925
The couple kept her in a box
under their bed for seven years.

35:06.926 --> 35:10.195
She was subject to every manner of abuse,

35:10.196 --> 35:13.764
but finally, she got free, and
the police were brought in.

35:13.765 --> 35:17.269
Do you have a photo of the couple?

35:17.270 --> 35:22.406
When I showed Jodi the pictures, her
reaction was the kind of reaction

35:22.407 --> 35:25.562
I've gotten in the past
when I told a family member

35:25.563 --> 35:30.243
about some terrible thing
that had happened.

35:30.282 --> 35:33.544
There they are in black and white...

35:33.545 --> 35:35.854
Real people.

35:35.855 --> 35:38.289
I saw the fright in her eyes.

35:38.290 --> 35:41.536
This is the most distressed
I've ever seen her.

35:41.537 --> 35:43.061
So then they caught the couple?

35:43.062 --> 35:44.929
Yeah, there was a big trial,

35:44.930 --> 35:49.336
and the wife immediately agreed
to testify against her husband.

35:49.337 --> 35:51.435
She gave the police a lengthy interview

35:51.436 --> 35:54.360
in which she made reference to
something that had happened

35:54.361 --> 35:57.145
a year before they had taken Colleen

35:57.146 --> 36:00.578
where they had kidnapped a
woman off of the street.

36:00.579 --> 36:02.347
Is it Marie?

36:02.348 --> 36:07.800
Janice told the police that the person
they kidnapped was Marie Spannhake.

36:07.801 --> 36:12.084
They took her to their home
where she was tortured.

36:12.085 --> 36:14.359
There was some very limited evidence

36:14.360 --> 36:18.363
and the woman's testimony,
but no hard proof.

36:18.364 --> 36:21.964
No body has ever been found.

36:22.507 --> 36:24.869
So now it's making sense to me.

36:24.870 --> 36:28.213
It's Marie Spannhake wanting justice...

36:28.214 --> 36:32.043
And communicating that to me in my dreams.

36:32.044 --> 36:34.684
[Engine roaring]

36:38.350 --> 36:40.450
35. 76.

36:40.917 --> 36:42.859
I hear numbers.

36:42.860 --> 36:44.890
35. 76.

36:44.891 --> 36:46.931
35.76.

36:55.417 --> 36:59.077
Now I get it. Now I get it.

36:59.267 --> 37:02.927
I was dreaming of a location.

37:05.010 --> 37:09.113
I felt it was important that
she take this to the police,

37:09.114 --> 37:14.634
and her initial reaction was,
they'll never believe me.

37:14.920 --> 37:19.357
I'm calling because I have some information
about the Marie Spannhake case.

37:19.358 --> 37:22.493
She was a girl who went
missing in Chico in 1976.

37:22.494 --> 37:24.088
I know this might sound strange.

37:24.089 --> 37:28.038
And he said, Jodi, why
are you calling today?

37:28.039 --> 37:30.969
Can you tell me why
you're calling right now?

37:30.970 --> 37:34.572
I had this overwhelming urge
like I needed to call you.

37:34.573 --> 37:36.240
You just gave me the chills.

37:36.241 --> 37:38.009
I can't give you too many details.

37:38.010 --> 37:40.778
But we are in the middle,
right now, of doing something

37:40.779 --> 37:42.646
in regards to this case.

37:42.647 --> 37:45.737
- Really?
- This very day.

37:45.738 --> 37:49.587
Within days, they sent down
lead detectives on the case,

37:49.588 --> 37:51.383
and they interviewed me for hours.

37:51.384 --> 37:55.092
This is the details you recall seeing
from Cameron Hooker's appearance?

37:55.093 --> 37:56.219
Yes, it was his belt.

37:56.220 --> 37:57.707
Every single detail.

37:57.708 --> 38:01.169
On the buckle, there was a
capital "H" in the middle.

38:01.170 --> 38:03.667
Things I had seen in my dreams.

38:03.668 --> 38:05.703
Yes. Exactly like this.

38:05.704 --> 38:11.604
The police can't confirm anything,
because it's still an open murder case.

38:11.606 --> 38:15.806
They asked me, so what's the 35.76?

38:15.856 --> 38:20.742
I think it's the coordinates to where
Marie Elizabeth Spannhake's remains rest.

38:20.743 --> 38:25.646
I was getting frustrated, because I
just wanted one thing to be confirmed,

38:25.647 --> 38:29.951
one thing that wasn't
in the public domain...

38:29.952 --> 38:32.824
Just for my own sanity.

38:32.825 --> 38:37.101
So I got in contact with
an investigative reporter.

38:37.102 --> 38:41.839
So Marie Spannhake gives you all
these clues to help try and solve

38:41.840 --> 38:44.789
the mystery of her disappearance...

38:44.790 --> 38:47.482
From beyond the grave?

38:47.483 --> 38:48.820
It's a bit convenient, isn't it?

38:48.821 --> 38:52.397
The story, initially, I didn't
know what to make of it.

38:52.398 --> 38:55.251
Maybe you dreamt this
up from magazines, or...

38:55.252 --> 38:56.654
I need your help.

38:56.655 --> 38:58.122
There's so much about it I just...

38:58.123 --> 38:59.854
I still don't understand.

38:59.855 --> 39:01.822
I just needed to know
that there was one thing

39:01.823 --> 39:05.310
in my dreams that was absolutely,

39:05.311 --> 39:09.271
without a shadow of a doubt true.

39:20.088 --> 39:22.248
Help me.

39:26.594 --> 39:28.728
When I approached the Red Bluff police,

39:28.729 --> 39:33.834
they wouldn't speak to me
about Marie's disappearance,

39:33.835 --> 39:38.038
but I was able to look through files
at the Chico Police Department,

39:38.039 --> 39:42.042
because they had a missing
persons file on her.

39:42.043 --> 39:44.613
There were interviews with people that

39:44.614 --> 39:48.215
Marie had lived with, worked with,

39:48.216 --> 39:51.636
her boyfriend at the time.

39:53.855 --> 39:58.525
And then there was the
testimony of Janice Hooker.

39:58.526 --> 40:02.296
I wanted to find something that
Jodi didn't have access to

40:02.297 --> 40:07.367
to prove to me and to anybody
else that her dreams were true,

40:07.368 --> 40:11.638
something that she wouldn't have been
able to read in a book or the newspapers.

40:11.639 --> 40:15.943
Late January 1976, we
were driving into Chico,

40:15.944 --> 40:20.347
when Cameron spotted a young woman
walking alongside the road.

40:20.348 --> 40:22.850
We stopped and offered her a ride.

40:22.851 --> 40:24.184
You're so pretty.

40:24.185 --> 40:27.187
Cameron had some difficulty
restraining her.

40:27.188 --> 40:28.188
[Gasping]

40:28.189 --> 40:30.790
She made a lot of noise.

40:30.791 --> 40:33.026
Please let me go!

40:33.027 --> 40:34.361
[Sobbing]

40:34.362 --> 40:37.697
After she was tortured, she was
brought upstairs to the bathroom.

40:37.698 --> 40:39.766
Finally, I found it...

40:39.767 --> 40:42.463
She was brought upstairs to the bathroom.

40:42.464 --> 40:45.973
The one piece of information
I'd been looking for.

40:45.974 --> 40:50.010
Cameron decided to cut her vocal cords.

40:50.011 --> 40:52.878
He used a knife to stop her from screaming.

40:52.879 --> 40:55.382
It corroborated Jodi's story.

40:55.383 --> 40:57.417
They cut her throat like that.

40:57.418 --> 41:00.787
She described all of this in great detail.

41:00.788 --> 41:05.259
Meredith had found buried in
the Janice Hooker confession

41:05.260 --> 41:09.497
a detail that hadn't been
revealed to the public.

41:09.498 --> 41:15.101
As a journalist, this is the smoking
gun that we're always looking for.

41:15.102 --> 41:17.504
Wow. I felt vindicated.

41:17.505 --> 41:20.839
I felt that now I had...

41:20.840 --> 41:22.820
Proof.

41:24.177 --> 41:26.891
This has been a huge part of my life,

41:26.892 --> 41:30.083
of Hannah's life, of my friend's life.

41:30.084 --> 41:32.998
I believe that it has been

41:32.999 --> 41:35.889
years of Marie Spannhake

41:35.890 --> 41:41.590
wanting justice to be served
and communicating that to me.
