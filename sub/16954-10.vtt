{\an8}Hey, cheers to Maverick,

21:19.678 --> 21:21.013
So what's--what's your day

21:21.079 --> 21:26.385
like now with three kids
and daycare and baseball?

21:26.451 --> 21:27.986
- It's definitely chaotic.

21:28.053 --> 21:29.755
I mean, now it's every morning,
like, I'll take him

21:29.821 --> 21:31.657

21:31.723 --> 21:33.959
drop Bentley
off at his summer camp,

21:34.026 --> 21:37.429
and then go to work and then
pick the three of them up later.

21:37.496 --> 21:40.732
I mean, it's--it's
definitely chaotic.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.768
{\an1}- And you're Bentley's
baseball coach too,

21:42.834 --> 21:44.836
{\an1}on the weekends, right?
So it never ends.

21:44.903 --> 21:46.571
- State champs.
- State champion.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.940
- Dad of the year over here.

21:49.007 --> 21:52.477
{\an3}- Bentley's with Ryan
at the moment.

21:52.544 --> 21:53.912
- It's a scary thought, like,

21:53.979 --> 21:55.547
{\an1}when they're over
at someone else's house,

21:55.614 --> 21:56.782
{\an1}and you don't know
how they're getting parented

21:56.848 --> 21:57.949
{\an1}or how people
are treating them, man.

21:58.016 --> 22:00.452
- Yeah.
- Later in life Bentley

22:00.519 --> 22:02.020
will realize that you--

22:02.087 --> 22:03.588
{\an1}that you don't have to do
anything that you do, you know?

22:03.655 --> 22:04.856
I mean, being a stepdad,

22:04.923 --> 22:07.659
{\an1}you're there
by your own choice,

22:07.726 --> 22:09.594
so he'll appreciate it.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.863
I mean, it's big.

22:11.930 --> 22:13.899
- It's weird 'cause I don't feel
like I'm doing anything extra.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.600
I'm just--just the way
I was raised,

22:15.667 --> 22:18.437
and I'm doing what
I'm supposed to do.

22:18.503 --> 22:20.472

22:20.539 --> 22:22.974
{\an3}before I moved out here
the role I was taking on,

22:23.041 --> 22:25.410
{\an3}and I wasn't gonna
come into his life and leave.

22:25.477 --> 22:27.012
{\an3}If I was gonna come in,
I was gonna be a father figure

22:27.079 --> 22:30.015
{\an3}and teach him everything
my dad taught me,

22:30.082 --> 22:31.516
{\an3}so I don't feel like
I treat Bentley

22:31.583 --> 22:34.920
{\an3}any different than I would
treat Jayde or Maverick.

22:34.986 --> 22:37.923
I mean, to me he's mine,

22:37.989 --> 22:39.424
and not that
I'm trying to replace Ryan.

22:39.491 --> 22:41.526
{\an3}It's just that, you know,
he lives over here,

22:41.593 --> 22:45.564
and I don't want him to feel any
different, you know what I mean?

22:45.630 --> 22:48.734
{\an3}I don't want him to feel like
he's a stepson

22:48.800 --> 22:52.003
{\an3}and I'm favoring them
or--you know what I mean?

22:52.070 --> 22:54.005
{\an3}If anything, I feel like I
go out of my way

22:54.072 --> 22:58.410
{\an3}to put him first
before my own, so.

22:58.477 --> 23:00.545
{\an3}I mean, I got--
got his name tattooed on me.

39:25.429 --> 39:28.132
And you do have that pressure,
and you want to be, you know,
