00:14.115 --> 00:16.648
He took the bait! We're only
gonna get one shot at this!

00:18.152 --> 00:19.551
One fish...

00:20.721 --> 00:22.287
two fish...

00:24.191 --> 00:25.324
red fish...

00:27.628 --> 00:29.495
dead fish.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.206
<i>Who's your daddy?</i>

00:42.243 --> 00:45.244
I used to love these
movies growing up.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.212
I'm sorry, did you say
something?

00:47.281 --> 00:50.382
The Shark Bite movies...
have you seen 'em?

00:50.451 --> 00:51.884
Yeah, unfortunately.

00:53.687 --> 00:56.088
Well, I think they're
kind of fun.

00:56.157 --> 00:58.424
Yeah? Which one is this?

00:58.492 --> 01:00.092
The fourth.

01:00.161 --> 01:03.562
Yeah, how can you even tell?
They all look the same.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.664
Well, Kurt Campbell has his
signature eye patch.

01:05.733 --> 01:09.968
He loses his eye in the sequel,
in a jellyfish explosion.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.004
That's ridiculous.

01:15.042 --> 01:17.242
So, how long have you been
on Tinder?

01:17.311 --> 01:19.211
A few months.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.780
Yeah, me, too... well, a month.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.616
This is actually the first time
I'm meeting someone.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.019
Yeah, that's cool. Cool.

01:27.088 --> 01:30.422
Um, look, I'm gonna go to the
deck and get some air.

01:30.491 --> 01:32.691
Okay, sure.
Watch my drink?

01:34.128 --> 01:36.395
No problem.
Thanks.

02:06.760 --> 02:11.463
Agh! Let me... gimme one sec.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.839
Hey, so I don't think
this is gonna work out.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.075
I think I'm gonna mingle for the
rest of the trip. Cool?

02:23.144 --> 02:25.043
Didn't you hear that awful
sound?

02:26.147 --> 02:29.181
All right, all right, look,
let's not play games here.

02:29.250 --> 02:32.918
You know? I mean, let's part
ways on a hand shake.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.453
No hard feelings?

02:48.369 --> 02:49.668
I need this. Thanks!

03:40.554 --> 03:42.254
Betty Willis' sheep got free...

03:42.323 --> 03:45.490
and she found 'em on the river
bank all torn to pieces.

03:47.228 --> 03:49.962
Sheriff Hurley says
it's a bobcat.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.000
Hey, you.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.869
So, I just need something
to keep me and my dogs safe.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.073
That right there is what
you're after.

04:01.141 --> 04:03.408
Got a good grip,
light on the trigger.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.945
Yeah, and it kicks like a mule.
Male bobcat's 30 pounds.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.014
A .22 handgun'll suit her
just fine.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.083
Rifle's gonna be easier
to reload.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.217
Well, they're quick, too.

04:12.286 --> 04:14.052
I doubt she's gonna get
a second shot in.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.088
And I'm guessin', you don't want
to kill it, right?

04:16.156 --> 04:17.422
Just scare it?

04:17.491 --> 04:18.890
Smart girl.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.961
I'll take it.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.864
Now where can I find
my mineral spirits?

04:25.933 --> 04:27.866
Second aisle.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.768
Second aisle.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.536
Nice to see you, Mrs. Chapman.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.408
Didn't expect you back
'til next week.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.744
Finished finals,
thought I'd surprise you.

04:38.812 --> 04:40.712
What about your labs?

04:40.781 --> 04:43.849
Cancelled.

04:43.917 --> 04:47.085
Well, it's good to have
you back.

04:47.154 --> 04:50.088
Had to... Mitchell tradition.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.691
Wouldn't want to miss that
Fishing Rodeo.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.760
Well, we're obviously winning
it this year.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.062
Pack that up for Ms. Chapman,
will '?

04:58.232 --> 05:00.065
It's like I never left.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.478
Biggest fish!
Yeah, that's what you do.

05:13.547 --> 05:14.680
A trout!

05:24.725 --> 05:26.558
So we'll get crowd shots
first...

05:26.627 --> 05:28.860
then one-on-ones with the
participants...

05:28.929 --> 05:30.295
and the organizers assured me...

05:30.364 --> 05:31.763
we'll get some time
with Jason London.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.733
Kid, you want 40 minutes
of footage...

05:34.802 --> 05:37.536
for a 30-second package
that they're gonna bury...

05:37.604 --> 05:39.204
between sports and weather?

05:39.273 --> 05:40.972
If we only get 30 seconds...

05:41.041 --> 05:43.575
it'll be the best 30 seconds
they've seen.

05:43.644 --> 05:46.345
It's just fish.

05:46.413 --> 05:49.147
And Deep Throat was just a guy
in a parking garage...

05:49.216 --> 05:51.116
until he toppled a presidency.

05:51.185 --> 05:54.186
You never know when a simple
assignment can turn out to be...

05:54.254 --> 05:56.254
the story of the century.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.866
Let's set up by the podium.

06:18.479 --> 06:19.778
Where do you want me to put the
dumpsters?

06:19.847 --> 06:23.081
Just over there somewhere.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.751
Just when will you be able
to pick them up?

06:25.819 --> 06:27.085
Not until tomorrow.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.888
Tomorrow? I'm gonna need clean
ones by then!

06:29.957 --> 06:32.124
Sorry.
Sorry?!

06:33.827 --> 06:36.461
Any word from Jason London?

06:36.530 --> 06:39.931
No, but we may have
a much bigger problem.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.368
A bigger problem than our
celebrity guest being a no show?

06:43.437 --> 06:46.505
The man's name is on
the damn sign!

06:46.573 --> 06:48.774
Yeah, no, no, you could say
it's bigger than that.

06:48.842 --> 06:53.879
Um, I just got word that there
was a bit of a... incident...

06:53.947 --> 06:56.047
on a steamboat down
in New Orleans.

06:56.116 --> 06:59.918
Now they aren't sure, be they
think there was a shark attack.

06:59.987 --> 07:02.621
A lot of people died,
they are sure of that.

07:02.689 --> 07:05.524
Was Jason London one of them?

07:05.592 --> 07:06.792
Well, I wasn't informed that...

07:06.860 --> 07:09.628
there was any Jason London
giblets, so I'm gonna say "no".

07:09.696 --> 07:13.698
Then why are you wastin'
my time?

07:13.767 --> 07:17.502
Um, because the governor's
office just sent us this memo...

07:17.571 --> 07:20.605
requesting that all nearby
counties cease all activities...

07:20.674 --> 07:22.140
on the water until they can
figure out more...

07:22.209 --> 07:23.508
which is gonna take a really
long time...

07:23.577 --> 07:25.043
because it's the government.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.112
Well, you can just tell the
Governor's office...

07:27.181 --> 07:31.249
that they can kindly take their
notice and fold it five ways...

07:31.318 --> 07:35.687
and then cram it where the elves
don't play!

07:35.756 --> 07:40.392
Do you know how much money
I have sunk into this thing?

07:40.461 --> 07:44.062
The answer is too much.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.432
Why... why would sharks attack
a river boat?

07:47.501 --> 07:49.468
I mean, something isn't right.

07:49.536 --> 07:52.571
Why are we still talking
about this?

07:52.639 --> 07:54.473
Because what if the sharks
swim up here?

07:54.541 --> 07:56.174
This is the Mississippi.

07:56.243 --> 07:59.644
Hundreds of miles between us
and New Orleans.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.746
What're the odds?

08:32.044 --> 08:33.879
The bobcat.

08:56.236 --> 08:59.404
I don't want to hurt you!
So, git!

09:21.728 --> 09:23.862
You sure your uncle's gonna
be okay with us...

09:23.931 --> 09:25.096
messin' with his wrecker?

09:25.165 --> 09:27.566
What he doesn't know,
won't hurt me.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.803
Besides, I drive the dang thing.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.438
All he does is lay
around the junk yard...

09:33.507 --> 09:34.973
reading Proust all day.

09:35.042 --> 09:38.076
Is that a euphemism I don't
understand?

09:38.145 --> 09:41.379
No, my uncle's really lazy,
but he's like super deep.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.253
Whatcha boys got there?

09:48.322 --> 09:50.188
This right here?

09:50.257 --> 09:52.791
This is gonna catch us
the biggest fish of the day.

09:52.859 --> 09:56.962
Only two things you need
to catch fish.

10:01.101 --> 10:05.070
With all due respect, sir,
we'll stick to our plan.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.404
Yeah.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.907
Good luck, boys.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.610
You're gonna need it.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.181
Agh!

10:18.685 --> 10:20.685
I can't believe that guy's
won two years in a row.

10:20.754 --> 10:23.555
Don't let him get to you.
This year is ours.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.956
You dang right!

10:25.025 --> 10:27.626
A few hours, I'll be on that
podium...

10:27.694 --> 10:29.628
raising the trophy in victory.

10:29.696 --> 10:31.296
Standing next to the best
guy I know.

10:31.365 --> 10:33.531
Thanks, Wy...
Jason London.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.835
The man, the myth, the legend.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.370
Try not to faint.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.472
I make no promises.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.779
Is that Tara Mitchell?

10:52.019 --> 10:54.786
Never thought I'd see her back
in podunk.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.790
Did you know she was coming
back?

11:01.028 --> 11:02.394
No.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.797
Okay.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.672
Think it's gonna be a big turn
out this year?

11:13.740 --> 11:15.306
Sure do.

11:15.375 --> 11:17.275
Heard this year's prize
includes a pickup...

11:17.344 --> 11:18.910
from one of Big Bill's lots.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.646
Really? That'd be great
for the store.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.750
We could start doing those
lumber deliveries.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.619
We?

11:27.688 --> 11:30.989
Yeah, I've been meaning
to tell you.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.892
I... I switched my major.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.828
Tara, you chose Hearst
specifically...

11:36.897 --> 11:39.464
for its biochemistry program.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.266
I changed my mind.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.936
What'd you change it to?

11:45.005 --> 11:46.371
Business.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.440
So I can help with the
hardware store.

11:49.576 --> 11:53.478
You're getting older.
You can't do it alone.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.580
Yeah, I'm not that old.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.949
You don't need to worry
about me, okay?

11:58.018 --> 12:00.118
It's a family business.

12:00.187 --> 12:02.821
Who's gonna take care of it,
if not me?

12:02.889 --> 12:05.223
I sent you off to school, so you
could follow your own path.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.959
Maybe this is my path.

12:08.028 --> 12:13.898
Ladies and gentlemen, can I get
everyone's attention?

12:15.435 --> 12:18.770
As most of you know,
I'm Big Bill Braddock...

12:18.839 --> 12:24.342
with Big Bill Braddock's Auto
Emporium...

12:24.411 --> 12:26.544
and I want to thank you all
for coming down...

12:26.613 --> 12:29.380
and supporting the Rodeo today.

12:29.449 --> 12:33.785
And I see we got last
year's winner right up front.

12:33.854 --> 12:36.488
Give 'em a big ole wave, Possum.

12:41.294 --> 12:44.763
Possum caught a 90-pounder.

12:44.831 --> 12:47.665
91.55!

12:49.803 --> 12:52.137
That's what you're up against,
folks.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.272
Rules are real simple.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.909
You've got three miles of
majestic Mississippi River.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.078
Boundaries marked by buoys.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.980
Don't matter how you catch it.

13:02.048 --> 13:04.682
Just bring your catfish
back down here...

13:04.751 --> 13:07.418
and the Weigh Master will toss
it up on the hook.

13:07.487 --> 13:08.987
Biggest fish wins.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.488
Any questions?

13:10.557 --> 13:11.656
Just one!

13:19.432 --> 13:22.133
Yes!

13:22.202 --> 13:24.235
Who's your daddy?

13:24.304 --> 13:27.071
All right, that's just a little
movie magic, folks.

13:27.140 --> 13:32.610
Ladies and gentlemen, you know
him as Kurt Campbell...

13:32.679 --> 13:37.015
special-ops sniper turned
marine biologist...

13:37.083 --> 13:40.685
in Shark Bite one through five.

13:40.754 --> 13:43.655
One, two, four and five,
the ones that matter.

13:43.723 --> 13:49.194
Your favorite action hero
and mine, Jason London.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.995
Big Bob, all right,
thank you, thank you!

13:51.064 --> 13:52.363
Bill.

13:52.432 --> 13:54.432
So nice to be here,
everybody!

13:54.501 --> 13:56.301
All right, I'm really honored
to be part of such...

13:56.369 --> 13:58.770
a fantastic event, so let's get
the show on the road, shall we?

13:58.839 --> 14:00.471
All right!

14:00.540 --> 14:04.976
On your mark. Get... set.

14:05.045 --> 14:08.313
And be sure to go watch
"Shark Bite Six...

14:08.381 --> 14:11.316
Here Comes Santa Jaws",
in theaters this Christmas!

14:22.963 --> 14:25.763
So what is this thing again?

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
We're not finished discussing
this, you hear?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.669
Dad, it's my choice.

14:31.738 --> 14:34.005
Well, I'll be.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.241
Possum.
Ray.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.043
What are you doing out here?

14:39.112 --> 14:41.746
You're not thinking
of competing?

14:41.815 --> 14:44.849
I'm trying to spend some quality
time with my daughter.

14:44.918 --> 14:47.051
Tara.
Possum.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.456
Well, can't fault a man for
wanting to play in the water...

14:51.524 --> 14:55.126
as long as you don't got
no delusions...

14:55.195 --> 14:57.428
of winning the prize money.

14:57.497 --> 15:00.498
Yeah, I think 20 years of losing
ought to be enough...

15:00.567 --> 15:04.435
for a any man, don't you?

15:04.504 --> 15:07.739
I wouldn't count us out just
yet, right?

15:12.245 --> 15:15.480
Hello?

15:16.950 --> 15:19.284
I'll be right there.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.719
Shipment just came in.
Truck's waiting at the store.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.021
Now?

15:23.089 --> 15:24.989
Driver must have messed
up the days.

15:25.058 --> 15:29.227
My, my, my... what a shame.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.798
I'll come with you.

15:33.867 --> 15:35.433
Tara, this isn't your
responsibly.

15:35.502 --> 15:38.603
This is what I'm talking about.
Everything falls on you.

15:38.672 --> 15:41.105
I don't want your help, Tara!

15:45.946 --> 15:50.915
Look, I want more for you than
just working at the shop.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.351
Bait some hooks and hold tight.

16:02.395 --> 16:06.364
Yeah, all right, all right.
Who's next?

16:06.433 --> 16:07.465
All right, all right,
you got one?

16:08.535 --> 16:10.668
Jason! Jason! Mr... I'm actually
your biggest fan!

16:10.737 --> 16:12.470
That's great...
really, thanks!

16:12.539 --> 16:16.074
No, like, literally top of the...

16:16.142 --> 16:18.409
sorry...

16:18.712 --> 16:21.079
Yeah, would you... you want
to sign my shirt?

16:21.147 --> 16:22.947
Yeah, sure.
'Cause you...

16:27.721 --> 16:29.687
Here you go. All right!
Excellent, excellent!

16:29.756 --> 16:30.955
Mr. London?

16:31.024 --> 16:32.757
Yes.
Excuse me.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.593
Hi... hi, I'm Allison Harting
with WIQZ.

16:35.662 --> 16:36.894
Can I get a few minutes
with you?

16:36.963 --> 16:38.129
Local affiliate?

16:38.198 --> 16:39.530
Biloxi.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.332
Listen, I only do the major
markets.

16:41.401 --> 16:42.934
You know, you gotta protect
the brand.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.669
You know what I'm saying?
No, thanks.

16:44.738 --> 16:47.638
But, um, I'm staying
at the casino.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.408
Maybe later, you know?

16:50.477 --> 16:51.776
All right.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.778
Yeah, you, are you next? All
right, here, you're up next.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.013
Just go.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.757
Here, let me help.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.929
Eric, right?

17:11.998 --> 17:13.431
That's me.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.165
Hey, how are you?

17:15.234 --> 17:18.202
Good. Great. Good.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.340
Um, been working at Big Bill's
car lot.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.842
Was March's employee of the
month.

17:24.911 --> 17:27.377
That's awesome.

17:27.446 --> 17:29.180
You're at Hearst, right?

17:29.249 --> 17:30.281
Yeah.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.550
You must be right at home there.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.252
What does that mean?

17:34.320 --> 17:36.254
Just, with like...

17:36.322 --> 17:39.357
the great scientific minds
of our generation.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.725
I don't know about that.

17:40.794 --> 17:44.695
Come on. Your study on enzymatic
hydrolysis of cellulose...

17:44.764 --> 17:48.132
and the production of cellulosic
ethanol for the science fair?

17:48.201 --> 17:50.668
I mean, that was crazy
impressive.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.104
That was my presentation
at Regionals.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.540
I... I didn't display that
at the high school...

17:55.608 --> 17:59.043
Yeah.

17:59.112 --> 18:04.649
Um, a couple of us took a road
trip to, you know, cheer you on.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.684
I didn't know that.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.955
It's no big deal.

18:11.024 --> 18:12.990
School spirit.

18:19.099 --> 18:22.667
I mean, Wyatt drove.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.268
I just chipped in for gas,
really.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.507
Actually, Eric?

18:29.576 --> 18:32.009
Sorry, that's actually not mine.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.050
This, too.

18:45.658 --> 18:47.325
Sorry.

19:32.071 --> 19:33.571
Agh!

19:39.112 --> 19:41.279
Hold on! I'm coming!

19:48.354 --> 19:50.421
Help me!
I'm coming!

19:52.559 --> 19:53.758
Help me!

19:53.826 --> 19:55.626
Come on! Grab my hand!

20:22.455 --> 20:24.355
What the...

20:24.424 --> 20:27.325
Just got an interesting text
from Mason.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.695
He's down in New Orleans
covering a shark attack.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.563
Get out.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.498
Apparently, a bunch of them
took out a steamboat.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.934
The governor is trying to keep
it hush, hush.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.837
Wait, there are sharks
in the Mississippi?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.339
<i>Sheriff, we got a call...</i>

20:41.407 --> 20:44.542
<i>about some loud yellin' down</i>
<i>by Brady's</i> Pass.

20:44.611 --> 20:45.843
<i>You wanna check it out?</i>

20:47.247 --> 20:48.346
<i>SHERIFF What do
you think, a fight broke out?</i>

20:49.582 --> 20:50.815
<i>DISPATCH Not sure,
but someone's makin' a whole...</i>

20:50.883 --> 20:52.850
<i>lotta noise about somethin'.</i>

20:54.254 --> 20:55.620
Let's go.

21:19.512 --> 21:21.612
So, when you heading out?

21:21.681 --> 21:24.582
I'm just waiting for my dad.
You?

21:24.651 --> 21:28.719
All set up... catfish beware.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.156
Are you gonna repossess them?

21:32.225 --> 21:34.625
Wyatt has this theory.

21:34.694 --> 21:37.194
Everyone fishes out on the
river, on the banks.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.063
The safest place for fish
is in the harbor.

21:39.132 --> 21:41.899
So it makes sense that the
biggest ones...

21:41.968 --> 21:45.903
would be around here,
because they live the longest.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.538
It's a working theory.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.373
Yeah, okay.

21:50.543 --> 21:53.744
Dude, you missed it!
I just met Jason London!

21:53.813 --> 21:55.913
I mean, he is like a god amongst
men, staring at him...

21:55.982 --> 21:58.249
was like looking
into a solar eclipse.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.885
I'm still kinda seeing
little spots.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.521
Wyatt's a fan.
Yeah.

22:03.589 --> 22:06.590
I don't see the appeal.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.760
You don't like the Shark Bite
movies?

22:10.730 --> 22:11.929
Not really.

22:14.100 --> 22:17.101
I mean, three is okay, I guess.

22:17.170 --> 22:19.070
We don't... we don't mention
three.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.205
We never mention three.
Three is verboten.

22:21.274 --> 22:23.774
Prawn of the Dead.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.911
The only one without
Jason London.

22:27.647 --> 22:29.046
Maybe don't say his name
like that.

22:29.115 --> 22:30.247
You're obsessed.

22:30.316 --> 22:31.382
It's a little disrespectful.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.054
- Hey, Dad.
<i>- Tara?</i>

22:37.123 --> 22:38.556
You're not ditching me,
are you?

22:38.624 --> 22:40.224
Tara? Are you on the water?

22:40.293 --> 22:42.526
No. I was waiting for you.

22:42.595 --> 22:45.096
I need you to stay right
where you are. Okay?

22:45.164 --> 22:47.732
Do not take the boat out,
promise me.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.667
Okay, you're scaring me.
What's going on?

22:49.736 --> 22:51.135
There are sharks in the water.

22:51.204 --> 22:52.837
<i>Wait, what?</i>

22:52.905 --> 22:57.208
Sharks! There are sharks
in the water!

22:57.276 --> 22:59.777
Slow down, Dad, you're not
making any sense.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.145
<i>Baby, I gotta go.</i>

23:01.214 --> 23:03.214
Just stay off the river, okay?

23:03.282 --> 23:05.082
<i>Stay off the river...</i>

23:05.151 --> 23:07.818
Dad? Dad!

23:09.989 --> 23:12.156
Hey, is everything okay?

23:12.225 --> 23:14.225
I just got a really weird call
from my dad.

23:14.293 --> 23:15.993
What did he say?

23:16.062 --> 23:18.362
I think something's wrong.
Do you have a car?

23:18.431 --> 23:20.197
Sure, I can take you anywhere
you need to go.

23:20.266 --> 23:22.566
Can I just... one minute.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.769
We have been planning this
for months!

23:24.837 --> 23:27.505
You, me and the Mekong!

23:27.573 --> 23:30.608
You can't just bail, we need
to get out on the water.

23:30.676 --> 23:32.243
Look at her. She's distressed.

23:32.311 --> 23:34.278
I'm distressed!

23:34.347 --> 23:36.480
Look, I get it. You've had this
thing for her since high school.

23:36.549 --> 23:37.848
No, it's not... I haven't...

23:37.917 --> 23:40.885
But... but, she spent
four years...

23:40.953 --> 23:42.953
barely registering your
existence.

23:43.022 --> 23:45.990
And now you wanna give up our
shot at glory, because of what?

23:46.058 --> 23:47.525
Because she wants to car pool?

23:53.065 --> 23:55.466
I'll be back as soon as I can.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.610
Betrayal cuts real deep, dude!

24:20.560 --> 24:22.426
Howdy, Ray.

24:28.935 --> 24:30.634
Rough morning?

24:31.637 --> 24:34.438
Mighty fine catch, Possum.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.707
94 and a quarter pounds.

24:38.444 --> 24:40.978
That one's gonna be tough
to beat, for sure.

24:41.047 --> 24:44.982
Yeah. You might as well call
this contest early, fellas.

24:45.051 --> 24:46.784
Don't count your chickens
before they hatch.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.519
Lotta day left.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.553
Bill?

24:49.622 --> 24:50.754
What is it?

24:50.823 --> 24:53.023
We have a bit of an issue.
Issue...

24:53.092 --> 24:54.658
Mr. London isn't
at his booth...

24:54.727 --> 24:57.828
and everyone's starting to get
really restless.

24:57.897 --> 25:00.531
I have to do everything myself!

25:00.600 --> 25:03.400
Now where is he, and what
is he up to?

25:05.605 --> 25:08.839
One fish. Two fish.

25:08.908 --> 25:12.743
Red fish. Dead fish.

25:12.812 --> 25:15.212
Bang.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.748
And that, ladies, is how
it's done.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.250
And if you really like that,
you're gonna have to check...

25:19.318 --> 25:22.453
out my Sci-Fi, buddy cop film,
Narc Sharks 2...

25:22.522 --> 25:24.955
The Fin Blue Line.

25:25.458 --> 25:28.425
He's all business,
I'm all heart.

25:28.494 --> 25:30.227
We start shooting in two weeks.
It's gonna be awesome!

25:30.296 --> 25:31.662
Mister London!

25:31.731 --> 25:32.863
Barry! There he is!

25:32.932 --> 25:34.765
It's Bill.

25:34.834 --> 25:37.034
Right, what can I do
you for, pal?

25:37.103 --> 25:39.904
We've got your table set up
for autographs.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.239
There's a line forming.

25:42.308 --> 25:43.874
I-I'm leaving soon.

25:43.943 --> 25:45.843
I'm only contracted
for two hours, buddy.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.945
You were an hour and a half
late!

25:48.814 --> 25:51.715
Listen, listen, look,
I feel you, I really do.

25:51.784 --> 25:53.484
And I don't mean to be
a spoil sport here...

25:53.553 --> 25:55.953
but, you know, I've got
troubles of my own!

25:56.022 --> 25:59.823
But, hey, Boudreaux, listen to
this, next year, you, me...

25:59.892 --> 26:02.660
you clear your schedule, I'll
get my people to clear mine.

26:02.728 --> 26:05.195
We'll do this the right way
this time, bigger and better.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.298
Bigger and better.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.136
Ladies?

26:14.674 --> 26:16.373
Did you hear that?

26:24.650 --> 26:27.351
Did someone just strangle a cat?

26:27.420 --> 26:28.352
Come on.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.354
What is that?!

26:42.101 --> 26:43.367
Mrs. Chapman.

26:43.436 --> 26:45.102
What could have done this?

26:49.609 --> 26:50.941
Sharks.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.444
What are you talking about,
sharks?

26:53.512 --> 26:56.614
There's a shark in the river,
maybe more than one.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.657
Wait, did you know about this?

27:06.726 --> 27:09.760
I... I might've.

27:10.796 --> 27:12.229
I thought it was a sham!

27:12.298 --> 27:15.099
Whoever heard of sharks
in a river?

27:15.167 --> 27:17.034
Bull sharks can live
in fresh water.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.303
You know what? Will you stop...

27:19.372 --> 27:20.738
and talk about the real victim
here?

27:20.806 --> 27:23.173
All right.
Please?

27:23.242 --> 27:24.608
I mean, I came here to host
this thing...

27:24.677 --> 27:25.809
and now I'm gonna be scarred
for life...

27:25.878 --> 27:27.378
because of some severed head!

27:27.446 --> 27:30.447
Mrs. Chapman is a real person
with friends and family...

27:30.516 --> 27:31.715
who will miss her!

27:38.824 --> 27:42.192
I mean, you're right. I-I don't
know what I was thinking.

27:42.261 --> 27:44.762
I'm... come here, bring it in,
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.630
That was really insensitive.

27:46.699 --> 27:50.100
I'm really sorry about
Mrs. Chapstick. I'm so sorry.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.669
This is serious!

27:51.737 --> 27:53.771
There are at least 40 fishermen
on the river.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.072
We need to warn them!

27:55.141 --> 27:56.373
Wait!

27:56.442 --> 27:57.541
Look, okay, you know what, guys?

27:58.678 --> 28:00.077
We have a situation here,
but luckily for everyone...

28:00.146 --> 28:02.946
There's no one more qualified
to deal with it than me.

28:03.015 --> 28:04.615
And how do you figure that?

28:04.684 --> 28:07.685
'Cause I know sharks,
I know what they think.

28:07.753 --> 28:09.853
I know how they feel.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.388
I know what they dream
about at night...

28:11.457 --> 28:12.790
and I'm their worst nightmare.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.658
It's like what I said
in Shark Bite Five...

28:14.727 --> 28:16.060
Shark of the Covenant...

28:16.128 --> 28:17.995
That mammal may have
the teeth...

28:18.064 --> 28:20.397
This mammal's got the brains.

28:20.466 --> 28:23.067
Sharks aren't mammals,
they're Chrondrichthyes.

28:23.135 --> 28:24.935
Listen, Princess, I don't
actually write the lines...

28:25.004 --> 28:27.004
I just say them with style,
you know?

28:27.073 --> 28:29.773
And if anyone is gonna carry us
out of this dark hour...

28:29.842 --> 28:32.042
it's gonna be me, all right?

28:32.111 --> 28:34.278
Excuse me for a second,
Buster, listen...

28:34.346 --> 28:39.116
Um, in case things go sideways
and you don't make it out...

28:39.185 --> 28:41.752
Um, think I could get paid
up front?

28:44.824 --> 28:48.726
Good gravy... and you're sure
it was a shark?

28:48.794 --> 28:50.461
I'd bet my life on it.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.830
'Cause we've been havin' trouble
with a bobcat.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.601
You know, Hurley, I may be
gettin' old, but I can still...

28:57.670 --> 29:00.204
tell the difference between
a shark and a bobcat.

29:01.373 --> 29:03.307
It's the fur, ain't it?

29:05.878 --> 29:08.011
Well, shoot.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.079
Still around?

29:09.148 --> 29:12.583
He swam off that way.

29:12.651 --> 29:15.486
Well, I can't leave him
floating down river.

29:15.554 --> 29:18.288
Let's get him on land,
and I'll call it in.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.824
I really don't think
you should go in there.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.693
It's fine.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.865
'Cause you're gonna cover me.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.802
This is a terrible idea.

29:31.871 --> 29:33.637
It's my job, Ray.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.775
See the shark? You shoot.

29:53.559 --> 29:56.827
Damn, it's Merle Hutchins.

29:57.429 --> 30:01.865
Just bought a brand-new
four-wheeler, too, damn shame.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.667
You okay?

30:03.736 --> 30:05.469
Yep.

30:05.538 --> 30:08.806
Son of gun should've
skipped a meal or three.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.620
That was close!

30:23.689 --> 30:26.757
It's all in the reflexes.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.859
Ain't no shark gonna get
the jump on me.

30:30.229 --> 30:31.628
Agh!

30:31.697 --> 30:35.699
Hurley!

30:35.768 --> 30:37.034
Where is he?
He's right behind you!

30:39.138 --> 30:40.904
Swim faster! Come on!

30:42.107 --> 30:43.941
Come on!

30:46.345 --> 30:48.579
Come on!

31:06.332 --> 31:07.698
Kinda close.

31:07.766 --> 31:10.067
Kinda? He almost gotcha.

31:10.135 --> 31:14.638
I meant the bullet. Were you
aimin' for me or the shark?

31:14.707 --> 31:16.139
You told me to shoot.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.408
Never said a thing about aiming.

31:19.645 --> 31:20.777
Thanks.

31:20.846 --> 31:23.080
Next time, we stay out
of the water.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.781
Agreed.

31:24.850 --> 31:28.719
Agh, son of a fish got my boot.

31:28.787 --> 31:30.153
Better than your leg.

31:30.222 --> 31:33.056
Heck, but now I'm gonna
be all lopsided.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.358
What is this?

31:34.426 --> 31:38.362
Officer! Officer!
Allison Harting, WIQZ.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.663
Can you tell me what's
happening?

31:39.732 --> 31:41.732
Excuse me, ma'am, this
is still an active crime scene.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.133
Is there a reason you're
all wet?

31:43.202 --> 31:44.635
Please, back away.

31:44.703 --> 31:46.169
And missing a boot?

31:51.577 --> 31:54.244
Harting, you
gotta see this!

31:54.313 --> 31:56.847
You'll get more than
a 30-second spot with this!

31:57.349 --> 32:00.350
Sir? I need you to back
away from the water!

32:04.757 --> 32:06.857
Phil!

32:06.926 --> 32:08.859
Agh! Agh! Agh!

32:10.229 --> 32:11.628
You need to close down
the rodeo.

32:11.697 --> 32:14.898
If I cancel this thing now,
I'll lose my shirt!

32:14.967 --> 32:17.601
Listen, if a fisherman gets hurt
out there by one of those...

32:17.670 --> 32:19.603
things and they find out you
knew about the sharks...

32:19.672 --> 32:22.973
and didn't tell anyone, you're
gonna lose more than your shirt.

32:24.176 --> 32:25.842
You need to make make
an announcement.

32:25.911 --> 32:28.312
Then we'll try and reach those
still on the river.

32:28.380 --> 32:32.449
Look, excuse me, but which one
of us here is the shark expert?

32:32.518 --> 32:34.184
Neither.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.219
Really? And what is it
that you do?

32:36.288 --> 32:37.688
I'm in college.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.389
Getting your MRS degree?

32:39.458 --> 32:41.792
Actually she's a brilliant
scientist.

32:41.860 --> 32:45.429
Enough! I'll make the damn
announcement!

32:45.497 --> 32:46.897
I'll do it.

32:46.966 --> 32:49.333
Listen, the people need
to hear this...

32:49.401 --> 32:51.068
from someone that they respect
and trust.

32:51.136 --> 32:54.404
I'm an actor. People care
what I have to say.

32:54.473 --> 32:57.074
I got this, Billie Jean,
all right?

32:57.142 --> 32:59.476
It's... agh!

32:59.545 --> 33:02.412
Fine! I've got enough
to deal with!

33:07.152 --> 33:09.653
That man's heart is as big as
his head, am I right?

33:11.457 --> 33:13.290
We should find Wyatt.

33:13.359 --> 33:15.892
Are you sure you've got this?

33:15.961 --> 33:17.027
Piece of cake.

33:31.477 --> 33:34.077
<i>One, two. Hey, everybody!</i>

33:37.182 --> 33:38.882
<i>You enjoying the rodeo?</i>

33:43.689 --> 33:45.789
<i>That's a shame, because we have
to cancel the event...</i>

33:45.858 --> 33:46.957
<i>effective immediately.</i>

33:47.026 --> 33:48.258
No way.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.794
<i>That's right, you are all
in horrible, horrible danger...</i>

33:50.863 --> 33:53.196
<i>so... pack it up.</i>

33:54.900 --> 33:57.434
<i>Are you not hearing me?
There are sharks in the water!</i>

33:57.503 --> 34:00.470
<i>They'll eat you.
They'll eat your kids.</i>

34:05.277 --> 34:07.077
You can dive in this water!

34:07.146 --> 34:11.380
Nice! Now do Shark Bite 3!

34:11.449 --> 34:14.016
You know I wasn't
in Shark Bite 3!

34:26.532 --> 34:28.732
Done being a chauffeur
for the day?

34:30.402 --> 34:32.034
I hope she gave you a tip.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.771
Not now, Wyatt.
We got a big problem.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.041
There are sharks in the water.

34:38.110 --> 34:39.842
Well, that sucks.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.847
Wait, you're not surprised?

34:43.916 --> 34:45.315
Shark poaching is on the rise.

34:45.384 --> 34:46.750
Only makes sense that the sharks
would relocate...

34:46.819 --> 34:48.485
to quieter water to hunt.

34:48.554 --> 34:53.255
Besides, bull sharks can survive
in the freshwater.

34:53.324 --> 34:56.326
Really? Come on, it was the plot
of Shark Bite 2...

34:56.395 --> 34:57.861
Sharks in the Ozarks?

34:57.930 --> 34:59.329
Come on.

35:00.666 --> 35:04.334
I think we got something!

35:09.908 --> 35:13.510
Listen, come on, baby...
come to mama, come on.

35:18.917 --> 35:20.650
This is gonna be a huge...

35:20.719 --> 35:22.986
Wy... don't.

35:23.055 --> 35:24.921
This's gotta be like a 500-pound
Mekong right here, man!

35:24.990 --> 35:26.022
Back up, Wy.

35:26.091 --> 35:27.724
Hold on! We gotta get him
in first.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.559
Gonna make it rain
with that prize money!

35:32.197 --> 35:34.331
That is not a catfish.

35:42.441 --> 35:44.641
Where's that hot little
reporter?

35:44.710 --> 35:46.076
Shark!

35:55.154 --> 35:59.389
Hey, kid! Hey, do me a favor.
Look, record this for me, okay?

35:59.458 --> 36:01.691
All right, there's a dollar
in it for '.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.694
Hey, hey, be sure to
keep me in frame, okay?

36:04.763 --> 36:06.897
Just me in the frame, all right?

36:06.965 --> 36:09.332
Guys, I'm coming!

36:13.338 --> 36:15.372
Not all heroes wear capes.

36:19.111 --> 36:21.511
That's a high sprain,
for sure!

36:38.063 --> 36:39.196
You want me to...
Agh!

36:39.264 --> 36:40.764
Okay, okay!

36:40.832 --> 36:42.532
You believe me now, people?

36:42.601 --> 36:44.267
You're welcome, by the way.

36:44.336 --> 36:45.635
Thank you.

36:47.172 --> 36:48.538
At least I kept you in frame.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.840
Yeah, thanks for nothing, kid!

36:51.877 --> 36:53.843
Where'd you get the Popsicle?

36:53.912 --> 36:56.179
You okay?

36:56.248 --> 36:59.015
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.520
We did it. We got the shark.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.822
Yeah... heroes.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.191
Guys...

37:20.839 --> 37:24.941
Hey, lanyard, are you
in charge here?

37:25.010 --> 37:29.312
Yes, at the moment,
it seems that I am in charge.

37:29.381 --> 37:30.981
There are sharks in the marina.

37:31.049 --> 37:33.583
We need to shut down
the competition.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.252
Like hell.

37:36.521 --> 37:41.524
This right here... this is
sabotage.

37:41.593 --> 37:44.261
Did you not just see
the shark we caught?

37:44.329 --> 37:46.496
You caught a shark, did '?

37:46.565 --> 37:47.998
In that contraption of yours?

37:48.066 --> 37:50.133
Yeah, pulled it up by the tail.

37:50.202 --> 37:51.334
And it was big?

37:51.403 --> 37:53.336
It was huge.

37:55.173 --> 37:57.107
What a shame.

37:57.175 --> 37:58.642
'Cause it clearly states...

37:58.710 --> 38:00.744
in the Monsters of the
Mississippi rulebook...

38:00.812 --> 38:07.150
page 47, section 4,
paragraph 2.2b...

38:07.219 --> 38:11.254
that any fish caught and entered
into this competition...

38:11.323 --> 38:15.759
must be indigenous to this
river, in order to qualify.

38:15.827 --> 38:18.995
Possum! No one cares
about the competition!

38:19.064 --> 38:20.664
People are dying!

38:21.833 --> 38:23.967
How many are registered?

38:24.036 --> 38:26.736
It says we have
35 participants.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.607
Did they sign up
with phone numbers?

38:30.676 --> 38:32.242
I mean, there's a slot
for it on the entry form...

38:32.311 --> 38:34.210
but I don't have those with me.

38:34.279 --> 38:35.345
Can we get them?

38:35.414 --> 38:36.980
I mean, they're back in the
harbor house.

38:37.049 --> 38:37.881
Yeah, I can go and get them.

38:37.949 --> 38:39.849
Yeah, hurry, please!

38:46.558 --> 38:48.858
You all right?

38:48.927 --> 38:50.260
No.

38:52.064 --> 38:56.132
This is my first assignment.
I just wanted to do a good job.

38:57.369 --> 39:00.003
<i>Sheriff? Sheriff, you there?</i>

39:04.309 --> 39:05.909
I'm here.

39:05.977 --> 39:07.477
<i>DISPATCH This is
gonna sound real crazy...</i>

39:07.546 --> 39:11.815
<i>but we're getting calls about a
shark at the marina.</i>

39:13.051 --> 39:14.818
Tara.

39:16.154 --> 39:17.387
On my way.

39:25.297 --> 39:27.130
What's taking that guy so long?

39:27.199 --> 39:29.299
Yeah, I'm thinking I should
just go look for him.

39:32.904 --> 39:34.938
Hey! Would you leave that alone?

39:36.375 --> 39:39.042
I don't think it counts.

39:40.145 --> 39:43.179
Wait, wait, what about this?

39:43.248 --> 39:46.349
Be serious! This is for our
Christmas card!

39:48.520 --> 39:52.322
A little to the left...
a little bit more.

39:54.326 --> 39:57.961
A little bit more... more...
perfect!

39:58.563 --> 40:00.096
Say "Shark attack!"

40:00.165 --> 40:01.598
Shark attack!

40:07.372 --> 40:08.371
Shark! Sha...

40:16.114 --> 40:17.580
How's it going, boss?

40:20.619 --> 40:22.585
No!

40:25.290 --> 40:27.991
Brain freeze!

40:28.059 --> 40:30.727
God, I'm having the worst luck
today.

40:35.801 --> 40:38.101
We're not gonna stop it.
We're not gonna shut it down.

40:38.170 --> 40:40.804
Big Fish Festival, because we
need to sell cars.

40:40.872 --> 40:42.172
What about the dead people,
Bill?

40:42.240 --> 40:43.339
People are getting eaten
by sharks.

40:43.408 --> 40:45.775
That's okay, dead people
need cars.

40:47.712 --> 40:52.215
No, no!
Crap!

40:54.119 --> 40:57.720
Okay, I'm gonna be
in so much trouble.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.856
This is so bad! Okay.

41:02.093 --> 41:07.096
Man... dangerous!

41:19.277 --> 41:22.245
It's slippery.

41:23.648 --> 41:28.685
No, but I hope the papers are
still legally binding.

41:28.753 --> 41:31.855
Thank you, science,
for buoyancy.

42:03.889 --> 42:06.256
There are so many.

42:06.324 --> 42:08.391
It's the blood in the water.

42:08.460 --> 42:10.827
Someone might as well have rang
a dinner bell.

42:10.896 --> 42:12.562
What are we gonna do?

42:16.001 --> 42:18.234
We need take 'em out.

42:18.303 --> 42:21.571
Wyatt, this isn't a Shark Bite
movie.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.606
We just can't take out a pack
of hungry sharks.

42:23.675 --> 42:26.042
Well, we have to do something!

42:26.111 --> 42:27.243
I mean, if we leave them,
they're just...

42:27.312 --> 42:28.945
They're gonna be up and down
the Mississippi...

42:29.014 --> 42:31.014
and there's gonna be no way
to catch them.

42:31.082 --> 42:34.384
He has a point. People are still
out on the river.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.020
We should take care
of them here...

42:37.088 --> 42:38.621
before anyone else gets killed.

42:38.690 --> 42:41.858
- Or dead.
- Yeah.

42:44.129 --> 42:46.396
We'd need an army.

42:46.464 --> 42:48.131
I'd settle for their guns.

42:52.137 --> 42:54.304
I know where we can get some.

42:59.044 --> 43:01.144
I don't care who you have to
call to make it happen...

43:01.212 --> 43:02.345
just make it happen.

43:02.414 --> 43:04.047
Get me out of here
or you're fired!

43:06.518 --> 43:07.951
Hey.

43:08.019 --> 43:10.219
Mr. London?

43:11.289 --> 43:12.488
We're going to get
reinforcements.

43:12.557 --> 43:13.823
We're gonna fight these things!

43:13.892 --> 43:16.960
That is a great idea.

43:17.028 --> 43:19.629
I'm gonna stay right here
and wait for my police escort.

43:19.698 --> 43:22.031
Aren't you going to help?

43:22.100 --> 43:24.867
In the last hour, I've wrestled
a shark, I've seen a man...

43:24.936 --> 43:26.569
eaten alive and I've been
attacked by a head...

43:26.638 --> 43:28.538
so, I'm gonna just stay
right here...

43:28.607 --> 43:30.039
and not go anywhere.

43:31.309 --> 43:34.077
But this is your thing!

43:35.246 --> 43:37.246
No shark is a match for you!

43:37.315 --> 43:40.617
Nice try. Hard pass.

43:43.254 --> 43:44.354
What about all the innocent
people...

43:44.422 --> 43:45.488
who are still on the water?

43:46.591 --> 43:49.525
Look, kid, my priority
is keeping this right here...

43:49.594 --> 43:50.994
in one piece today.

43:51.062 --> 43:54.230
So, sorry, good luck, though.

43:57.435 --> 44:01.971
I thought you were a hero,
but you're a fraud.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.540
Leave him.

44:05.710 --> 44:07.210
My dad's shop is across
the river.

44:07.278 --> 44:08.845
Let's take my boat, it's faster.

44:08.913 --> 44:10.847
Yeah, let's go.

44:12.083 --> 44:13.950
Let's go be <i> real</i> heroes.

44:19.958 --> 44:25.094
I am a real hero. I've got my
own franchise to prove it.

44:40.311 --> 44:42.812
Really?

44:45.350 --> 44:48.317
Um... miss?

44:56.227 --> 45:00.329
Okay, London, let's show
these people...

45:00.398 --> 45:02.065
what a SyFy Movie Award
winner...

45:02.133 --> 45:04.500
for best shirtless performance
can do.

45:08.873 --> 45:10.306
One fish.

45:11.976 --> 45:13.276
Two fish.

45:15.413 --> 45:16.512
Red fish.

45:18.950 --> 45:20.516
Dead fish!

45:26.791 --> 45:28.658
Shark.

45:34.966 --> 45:38.735
Jason!

45:43.608 --> 45:45.508
Wy?!

45:50.315 --> 45:52.615
Please be alive. Please be
alive. Please be alive.

45:52.684 --> 45:55.918
Do you see him?
Do you see him?

46:00.792 --> 46:02.692
Maybe he's still okay.

46:10.235 --> 46:12.135
That's less reassuring.

46:17.475 --> 46:20.076
Now we're never gonna get
a Shark Bite 7.

46:20.145 --> 46:22.712
I'm sorry, Wyatt, but I think
we should go.

46:22.781 --> 46:23.913
Yeah.

46:33.124 --> 46:35.124
Let's take my car.

46:35.193 --> 46:36.592
Yeah.

46:48.873 --> 46:50.573
He went out a hero, man.

46:50.642 --> 46:52.041
Yeah.

46:55.547 --> 46:58.848
I just can't believe he's gone.
I know. I know.

46:58.917 --> 47:00.149
I mean, at least we still
have Jeremy.

47:00.218 --> 47:02.385
Yeah.

47:02.453 --> 47:04.821
I'm gonna have a Shark Bite
marathon when this is over.

47:06.257 --> 47:08.157
One through five.

47:08.226 --> 47:11.160
Not three. Never three.

47:11.229 --> 47:12.995
I think he'd like that.

47:18.203 --> 47:22.138
I call the Dirty Harry gun!

47:24.542 --> 47:27.610
That is a .45, Dirty Harry
had a .44 Magnum.

47:33.218 --> 47:44.093
Well... I call the shotgun.

47:44.162 --> 47:46.829
You know, I don't think
we have enough.

47:48.967 --> 47:50.299
I think we may need more.

47:51.736 --> 47:55.571
Like knives?

47:55.640 --> 47:56.706
Like bombs.

47:56.774 --> 47:58.507
Your dad sells bombs?

47:58.576 --> 48:00.943
No, her dad doesn't sell bombs.

48:03.915 --> 48:06.048
Right?

48:06.117 --> 48:08.751
No, he doesn't sell bombs.

48:08.820 --> 48:10.620
But he should have everything
here to make them.

48:10.688 --> 48:13.055
We get to make bombs?

48:20.698 --> 48:25.334
Y... actually, could you just
grab the fertilizer over there?

48:25.403 --> 48:29.872
Right! Yeah, just grab
the... okay.

48:35.513 --> 48:39.882
Fertilizer, so we can make
the sharks... grow?

48:39.951 --> 48:41.217
It has got ammonium nitrate.

48:41.286 --> 48:43.419
We're just gonna do some simple
chemical reactions.

48:49.527 --> 48:51.260
Brilliant scientist, dude.

48:54.332 --> 48:55.865
So what's the plan?

48:56.935 --> 48:59.635
Same as it's always been...
we go fishing.

49:21.559 --> 49:23.192
Broke.

49:23.261 --> 49:25.027
She'll figure it out.

49:38.176 --> 49:39.942
One fish.

49:40.011 --> 49:42.378
Two fish. Red fish.

49:42.447 --> 49:45.381
Dead fish.

49:59.297 --> 50:03.466
So, is this what they're
teaching at Hearst these days?

50:03.534 --> 50:05.868
I wouldn't know.

50:08.106 --> 50:10.706
I dropped out of the science
program.

50:10.775 --> 50:12.842
Why?

50:14.278 --> 50:17.279
It just wasn't what I was
expecting.

50:18.883 --> 50:21.717
I got there and everyone
was so... smart.

50:21.786 --> 50:24.520
I was this little fish
in a giant pond.

50:25.723 --> 50:27.356
Don't.

51:02.760 --> 51:07.630
I guess I realized that
maybe I wasn't good enough.

51:08.399 --> 51:11.434
How can you say that? I mean,
look at what you're doing here.

51:12.770 --> 51:14.670
Making bombs.

51:16.374 --> 51:20.009
Well, yeah, I guess,
specifically.

51:20.078 --> 51:22.978
But, you made all of these
combinations.

51:23.047 --> 51:26.182
This is who you are.

51:27.185 --> 51:32.221
Yeah, I used to think so. I'm
not really sure anymore, though.

51:32.290 --> 51:34.323
Do you love it?

51:36.794 --> 51:37.893
Yeah.

51:37.962 --> 51:39.862
Then do it.

51:39.931 --> 51:43.099
It's not that simple.
And why not?

51:44.969 --> 51:46.669
What if I fail?

51:48.406 --> 51:52.408
Then you fail at something
you want to do.

51:52.477 --> 51:54.210
And I think that's a lot
better...

51:54.278 --> 51:56.645
than succeeding at something
you don't.

52:02.053 --> 52:04.353
But for the record?

52:06.290 --> 52:08.157
I believe in you.

52:11.095 --> 52:12.661
All packed.

52:22.507 --> 52:24.240
Ready to roll?

52:24.308 --> 52:26.442
Yeah, yeah, we're all done.

52:29.547 --> 52:30.846
No.

52:30.915 --> 52:32.548
Wh... no, look, I got it.

52:32.617 --> 52:34.183
I got two for each of you guys.

52:34.252 --> 52:35.484
No.

52:35.553 --> 52:38.487
Come on, if not now, when?

52:41.526 --> 52:43.125
Killjoy.

52:48.232 --> 52:49.865
It's gonna work in the water?

52:49.934 --> 52:53.068
Yeah, the wicks are coated
with nitrocellulose lacquer.

52:53.137 --> 52:54.403
So they should be good.

52:54.472 --> 52:56.138
Right, no, yeah, of course...

52:56.207 --> 52:58.007
Nitrous... cellulite...

52:59.777 --> 53:01.377
Let's go, before anyone
else dies.

53:01.445 --> 53:02.711
Yeah.

54:13.217 --> 54:14.650
<i>DISPATCH Sheriff,
you ain't gonna believe this...</i>

54:14.719 --> 54:18.854
<i>but we're getting more</i>
<i>reports of sharks in the</i> water.

54:18.923 --> 54:20.522
I believe it.

54:20.591 --> 54:22.057
<i>We got no cars to send.</i>

54:22.126 --> 54:24.994
<i>Deputy's out on a call.
What's your ETA?</i>

54:25.062 --> 54:27.796
I'm about 15 now to the station.

54:27.865 --> 54:31.000
And Lyla, can you wrangle
me up an extra boot?

54:34.238 --> 54:35.604
Look out!

54:45.216 --> 54:46.415
What?

54:57.662 --> 54:59.662
Sir? Are you okay?

55:16.681 --> 55:18.614
Well, that was lucky.

55:18.683 --> 55:21.116
I think we were long overdue.

55:30.661 --> 55:33.295
Lyla? Scratch the boot.

55:33.364 --> 55:35.164
I'm gonna need a tow truck.

55:47.678 --> 55:52.247
So, um, you guys seem
to be getting close.

55:58.022 --> 56:00.055
It's... it's just the situation.

56:00.124 --> 56:02.291
A situation you should
make the most of.

56:02.360 --> 56:04.960
What is that supposed to mean?

56:05.029 --> 56:07.096
She's distraught.

56:07.164 --> 56:10.532
She needs a shoulder to cry on.
You got the great shoulder.

56:17.241 --> 56:19.041
I don't think so, Wyatt.

56:19.110 --> 56:22.678
Okay, literally, what is the
worst thing that could happen?

56:22.747 --> 56:25.013
Crushing humiliation?

56:25.082 --> 56:29.752
Total rejection, eventual
heartbreak.

56:29.820 --> 56:32.454
Shark attack... you didn't
say that.

56:32.523 --> 56:34.757
But no, those three are really
important, too.

57:04.889 --> 57:07.923
This isn't working.
I can't get a lock on them.

57:07.992 --> 57:10.292
Maybe if we move closer?

57:12.029 --> 57:13.896
Let's try this.

57:35.319 --> 57:37.753
Yes! Got it!

57:43.727 --> 57:46.128
No, dude, you just scared it.

57:46.197 --> 57:47.729
Damn.

57:47.798 --> 57:49.631
We may need a new plan.

57:51.435 --> 57:53.735
What if we put some bombs
in some fish?

57:53.804 --> 57:56.572
What in tarnation
are you kids doing?

57:56.640 --> 57:58.207
We're taking out the sharks!

57:58.275 --> 58:00.609
You're taking out the boats!

58:00.678 --> 58:02.444
My insurance don't cover this!

58:02.513 --> 58:04.179
But we're saving lives.

58:04.248 --> 58:06.081
You're causing mayhem!

58:06.150 --> 58:10.252
You're out here on private
property with rifles and...

58:11.822 --> 58:14.122
Is that a bag of bombs?

58:14.191 --> 58:18.427
Do you know how many laws
you've broken?

58:18.496 --> 58:20.496
One?
No.

58:20.564 --> 58:23.332
Two?
No!

58:23.400 --> 58:25.200
Well, I'm out of guesses.

58:25.269 --> 58:26.768
There is blood on your hands!

58:26.837 --> 58:29.271
There are sharks in the river
and they're eating people!

58:29.340 --> 58:30.539
You've done nothing about it!

58:30.608 --> 58:32.875
I've had enough of this.

58:34.712 --> 58:36.979
Hey! Come on, lemme...
Okay! Okay!

58:37.848 --> 58:40.249
Let's just calm down, okay?

58:41.085 --> 58:42.918
What are you gonna do,
shoot him?

58:42.987 --> 58:45.187
Yeah, no, he might...
He might shoot me.

58:45.256 --> 58:50.659
Girl, you need to learn
to respect your elders!

58:52.196 --> 58:54.663
I respect you, I totally
respect you, dude, you're old.

58:54.732 --> 58:57.132
Now, I've had enough
of you kids...

58:57.201 --> 59:03.472
ruining my beautiful,
very expensive festival.

59:03.541 --> 59:04.840
That was the sharks!

59:04.909 --> 59:07.009
The sharks ain't never
done nothin' to me.

59:07.077 --> 59:10.145
But you all have. Now get!

59:10.214 --> 59:11.580
Yep.

59:18.289 --> 59:20.889
My... my money, all my money...

59:20.958 --> 59:24.059
Sharks are an endangered
species, you know?

01:00:00.564 --> 01:00:03.599
Can't get any reception
for some reason.

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:05.434
It won't be long, Ray.

01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:10.639
It's just that... Tara and me
didn't leave things...

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:12.040
on the best of terms.

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:15.844
We had a little,
disagreement.

01:00:15.913 --> 01:00:17.245
Really?

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:19.715
She up to no good
at that fancy college?

01:00:19.783 --> 01:00:22.084
Drinkin'? Druggin'?

01:00:22.152 --> 01:00:25.721
No, she wants to take over
the hardware store.

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:28.223
You lost me, pal.
Ain't that a good thing?

01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:29.725
It's just that every since
she was a little kid...

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:31.960
she loved science, you know?

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:35.163
She was five years old she asked
for a microscope...

01:00:35.232 --> 01:00:37.232
so she could study the leaves
outside.

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:43.639
It's always been her dream,
and now suddenly... it isn't.

01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:46.408
Maybe it was too much for her.

01:00:46.477 --> 01:00:48.977
No, see, my Tara's as bright
as they come.

01:00:49.046 --> 01:00:51.246
She's a presidential scholar.

01:00:51.315 --> 01:00:53.415
That's what I mean.

01:00:53.484 --> 01:00:55.517
Sometimes when people have such
high expectations...

01:00:55.586 --> 01:00:57.452
it can be overwhelming.

01:00:57.521 --> 01:01:00.355
Maybe she was just scared
to disappoint you.

01:01:01.892 --> 01:01:04.326
I guess I just wanted something
more for her...

01:01:04.395 --> 01:01:06.194
than this tiny, little town.

01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:08.797
Hey, now, what's wrong
with this tiny town?

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:10.832
I mean, it's a fine place
to live.

01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:12.534
We got friendly folks,
good food...

01:01:12.603 --> 01:01:13.769
Sharks.

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:17.506
Well, now, to be fair,
that part's new.

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.946
Think it's another attack?

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:27.449
Better go find out.

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:28.950
Hurley, I gotta get
to the marina.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.420
I need to see with my own eyes
that Tara's okay.

01:01:31.488 --> 01:01:33.722
I'll meet you there.
All right.

01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:38.260
Come on.

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:39.695
Are we far?

01:01:41.398 --> 01:01:42.664
A few miles.

01:01:51.842 --> 01:01:53.275
I'm sure she's okay.

01:01:53.343 --> 01:01:56.645
I was at the marina a little
while ago. No sharks in sight.

01:02:01.151 --> 01:02:04.453
Can I offer some very
unsolicited advice?

01:02:04.521 --> 01:02:06.855
I suppose.

01:02:06.924 --> 01:02:09.124
You should let her make her
own mistakes.

01:02:09.193 --> 01:02:11.393
If we get there and she's happy,
healthy and in one piece...

01:02:11.462 --> 01:02:13.962
I'll let her drop out of school
and join the damn circus.

01:02:14.031 --> 01:02:15.597
How's that?

01:02:16.533 --> 01:02:18.233
Works for me.

01:02:21.839 --> 01:02:24.439
Hey! I need you
to get off the water!

01:02:24.508 --> 01:02:26.842
There's a shark in here!

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:30.445
I know that already!
I'm not comin' in after you.

01:02:30.514 --> 01:02:31.713
Now grab your damn oars!

01:02:31.782 --> 01:02:33.281
Imma get that son of a bitch.

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:37.018
Idiot. You're gonna get yourself
eaten!

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.720
No, I can do this!

01:02:48.065 --> 01:02:50.098
I'll be damn.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:58.707
So what do we do now?
I mean, we can't just give up?

01:02:58.776 --> 01:03:00.242
I mean, there are lives
at stake.

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:03.378
Well, I don't know what else
we can do.

01:03:04.848 --> 01:03:06.915
We murder Big Bill.

01:03:06.984 --> 01:03:09.651
No.
Okay, I got it.

01:03:11.455 --> 01:03:12.921
What if we spin the earth
backwards...

01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:14.022
and we reset the timeline?

01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:15.991
Be serious, Wy.

01:03:18.695 --> 01:03:21.062
Destroy the last Horcrux.
Wyatt.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:24.299
At least, I'm trying! Thinking...

01:03:24.368 --> 01:03:26.201
I mean, you two look like
you're ready to quit.

01:03:31.108 --> 01:03:33.475
Unbelievable!

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:43.251
Let me tell you a story...
about a little boy...

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:45.520
who desperately wanted to ride
a bike, but one of his legs...

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:47.289
was a half an inch shorter
than the other one...

01:03:47.357 --> 01:03:50.392
proving this goal to be
nearly impossible.

01:03:50.460 --> 01:03:51.426
Really?

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:53.695
Sure, he was discouraged!

01:03:53.764 --> 01:03:55.397
There were bumps and there
were bruises...

01:03:55.465 --> 01:03:58.333
and there were fat lips
along the way, but he tried.

01:03:58.402 --> 01:04:01.002
And every morning he got up
with the sun and he peddled...

01:04:01.071 --> 01:04:05.907
his little heart out until one
day, he found himself soaring...

01:04:05.976 --> 01:04:09.311
through the middle of town,
wind in his hair.

01:04:11.315 --> 01:04:13.381
Do you know who that
little boy was?

01:04:14.384 --> 01:04:15.884
You?

01:04:15.953 --> 01:04:19.354
No! Jason London!

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:20.856
It's like she hasn't been
listenin'...

01:04:20.924 --> 01:04:22.123
to anything I've said today.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:25.126
Great story, Wy, but how's it
gonna help us?

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:30.532
The point is, if you want
something, you don't give up.

01:04:31.668 --> 01:04:34.769
Wait. How strong is this
wrecker crane?

01:04:34.838 --> 01:04:37.339
Pretty strong, but it took
a beating earlier...

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:38.807
pulling up that shark.

01:04:38.876 --> 01:04:40.041
Can you fix it?

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:43.912
Take about half an hour or so,
but I think we could do it.

01:04:44.915 --> 01:04:46.982
The wrecker's not going to help
us with that many sharks.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.783
I mean, what are we gonna pull
'em in one-by-one?

01:04:48.852 --> 01:04:50.452
You see that bridge?

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.686
Yeah?

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:54.923
We use it as a pulley, drop
a net big enough for all them.

01:04:54.992 --> 01:04:58.293
They swim in, we spring the
trap, pull them up...

01:04:58.362 --> 01:05:00.762
with the crane, using the bridge
as a fulcrum.

01:05:00.831 --> 01:05:02.564
Exactly, exactly.

01:05:04.368 --> 01:05:05.767
You're serious, okay.

01:05:05.836 --> 01:05:08.904
Um, am I really gonna have to be
the voice of reason here?

01:05:08.972 --> 01:05:11.239
Because, if that's the case,
we are in a lot of trouble.

01:05:11.308 --> 01:05:13.375
You don't think it's gonna work?

01:05:13.443 --> 01:05:16.311
What are we gonna sweet talk
them into getting into the net?

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.479
No, we'll chum the water.

01:05:17.547 --> 01:05:19.147
There's tons of it,
because of the competition.

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:20.749
They'll come to us.

01:05:20.817 --> 01:05:24.719
Okay, so we scoop them up and
then what, they just hang out?

01:05:24.788 --> 01:05:28.823
No... then we use a bomb.

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:31.326
See, now that's a great idea!

01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:34.029
Except for that jack wad
took all of the bombs!

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:43.004
Not all of them.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:06.895
Damn kids and their damn
vigilante justice.

01:06:06.964 --> 01:06:11.099
Trying to ruin my... Possum!

01:06:11.168 --> 01:06:16.171
Whatcha got there,
Possum?

01:06:16.239 --> 01:06:18.907
Nothin?
Nothin'?

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:20.375
Nope.

01:06:20.444 --> 01:06:22.644
What you got behind your back?

01:06:25.749 --> 01:06:27.148
River mostly.

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:30.452
Enough foolin! You hand that
over right now!

01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:35.423
This here is mine.
I won it fair and square!

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:40.562
That is the property of the
Monsters on the Mississippi...

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:42.063
and by extension me!

01:06:42.132 --> 01:06:49.104
It is to leave my possession
only when the winner is crowned.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:50.805
You saw my catch!

01:06:50.874 --> 01:06:53.041
Ain't nobody gonna win, but me!

01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:56.811
You hand that over right now!

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.013
Fat chance!

01:06:58.081 --> 01:06:59.147
Let go!

01:06:59.216 --> 01:07:01.349
If I can't have it, nobody can!

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:02.517
Let go!

01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:03.685
It's mine!

01:07:03.754 --> 01:07:04.986
Is not!
It is!

01:07:05.055 --> 01:07:06.888
Isn't!
Is!

01:07:06.957 --> 01:07:08.556
Isn't!

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:13.094
Agh!
Agh!

01:07:16.299 --> 01:07:17.732
Agh!

01:07:22.973 --> 01:07:26.608
How's it going down there?
Good.

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:28.376
Hey, can you pass me that
socket wrench?

01:07:36.086 --> 01:07:39.120
Okay, this'll work,
I think...

01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:42.090
I'm messing with you. Here.

01:07:43.527 --> 01:07:44.893
I knew that.

01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:46.895
Did you?

01:07:46.963 --> 01:07:48.196
Okay, no.

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:50.932
'Cause my dad owns a hardware
store.

01:07:51.001 --> 01:07:53.068
Well, I didn't want to assume...

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:57.138
Why didn't we hang out
in high school?

01:07:58.375 --> 01:08:01.743
I think you'd have to have
noticed me first.

01:08:01.812 --> 01:08:04.079
I noticed you.
What?

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:08.616
Are you okay?

01:08:08.685 --> 01:08:11.152
Yeah, no problem.

01:08:11.221 --> 01:08:12.554
Here.

01:08:17.394 --> 01:08:19.260
You noticed me?

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:20.995
Sure.

01:08:22.666 --> 01:08:25.800
I just thought you hated me.
What?

01:08:25.868 --> 01:08:28.169
Yeah, you were always avoiding
me in the halls...

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:29.304
And you'd never look at me.

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:31.639
No, it was just that...

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:33.308
Hey!

01:08:33.376 --> 01:08:36.544
Any clue where we're gonna
get a big enough net?

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:40.281
There should be plenty
by the marina.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:42.417
Why don't you go and check,
Wy...

01:08:42.486 --> 01:08:44.886
while me and Tara finish working
on the wrecker?

01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:49.057
Yeah, um, no, I don't...

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:51.292
I don't think I should go
there alone...

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:53.928
because he's got that gun,
and he could shoot me with it.

01:08:53.997 --> 01:08:56.064
And plus, I'm allergic to musk,
which if...

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:57.232
Yeah, it's fine, I'll go.

01:08:57.300 --> 01:08:59.000
Okay.
I'll go.

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:02.303
Yeah, that's probably a safer
idea.

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:12.313
Hey, I think she likes the cut
of your jib.

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:14.381
You get it, it's like
a crane joke?

01:09:14.451 --> 01:09:17.752
Or a boat joke, or a Marine
joke, if you're in the Marines.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:19.154
Because that was some...

01:09:21.725 --> 01:09:23.224
You okay?

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:28.196
Yeah, just stupid.

01:09:28.932 --> 01:09:31.366
That's the only problem?
I didn't know if you had more.

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:32.767
'Cause, man, I knew you
were stupid.

01:09:32.836 --> 01:09:34.402
'Cause that's like a...

01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:37.438
What I say?

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.840
Yeah, that should be big enough.

01:10:12.909 --> 01:10:15.610
Perfect.
Did you see Big Bill?

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:19.380
I think the sharks got to him.

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:22.984
Nice.
Wyatt.

01:10:23.053 --> 01:10:25.753
I mean, no, that's not...
That's not good.

01:10:25.822 --> 01:10:27.622
I'm gonna grab the net.

01:10:28.992 --> 01:10:32.193
Man! Who'd carry this?

01:10:32.262 --> 01:10:34.896
I'm gonna get the chum.
I'll be back in 15.

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:37.799
Hey, Tara?

01:10:39.035 --> 01:10:40.802
Yeah.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:42.036
You think when this is over...

01:10:42.105 --> 01:10:45.106
that maybe we can grab
a coffee sometime?

01:10:45.175 --> 01:10:48.142
Yeah, I'd like that.

01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:50.678
Great.

01:10:51.481 --> 01:10:53.281
If you don't die first.

01:10:53.984 --> 01:10:57.385
What, do you think there's a
chance that might happen?

01:11:02.392 --> 01:11:04.125
I'm just kidding.

01:11:05.362 --> 01:11:07.662
I knew that time.

01:11:07.731 --> 01:11:10.131
Yeah, I was just playing along.

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.500
Totally in on the joke.

01:11:33.023 --> 01:11:34.155
Ready?

01:11:34.224 --> 01:11:36.557
Yeah, locked and loaded.

01:11:39.229 --> 01:11:41.763
Tara?
Dad!

01:11:45.101 --> 01:11:46.834
I'm sorry about earlier.

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:48.503
I trust you to make your own
decisions...

01:11:48.571 --> 01:11:50.338
and I'll support them,
whatever they are.

01:11:50.407 --> 01:11:54.442
Thanks, Dad, but I think I'm
gonna drop my business major...

01:11:54.511 --> 01:11:56.611
and get back in the lab.

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.846
Only if that's what you
really want to do.

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:00.481
It is.

01:12:01.518 --> 01:12:04.118
A heartwarming reunion between
father and daughter...

01:12:04.187 --> 01:12:06.554
amid the chaos of the day.

01:12:08.758 --> 01:12:10.625
Hello.

01:12:10.694 --> 01:12:12.760
Allison Harting, WIQZ.

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:20.468
Where is everyone?

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:25.206
I can tell you on the way,
but can you help me with this?

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:28.409
What's in it?

01:12:34.017 --> 01:12:35.917
All right, then.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.708
Are they gone?

01:13:00.777 --> 01:13:03.778
They've been swimming
in the marina all day.

01:13:03.847 --> 01:13:06.013
I don't know why they'd
suddenly leave.

01:13:06.082 --> 01:13:09.250
Must have swam up the river.

01:13:11.788 --> 01:13:13.888
Do you think we're too late?

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:34.842
Wait! Here they come!

01:13:41.818 --> 01:13:44.786
Looks like we finally gonna get
some fishing done.

01:13:47.223 --> 01:13:50.558
Wy! Be ready, on my call!

01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:51.993
Yeah!

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:07.842
Now!

01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:10.611
Wy! Go!

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:31.199
I think we got it!

01:14:41.377 --> 01:14:44.412
Yes! Work... it worked!

01:14:46.115 --> 01:14:47.715
I'm coming up!

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:58.559
I can't believe that worked.
Never any doubt.

01:14:59.562 --> 01:15:01.829
Do I even want to know how you
got a pipe bomb?

01:15:01.898 --> 01:15:05.967
I, um... I made it.

01:15:06.035 --> 01:15:07.134
You made it?

01:15:07.203 --> 01:15:09.470
Yeah, well, you're the one who's
always encouraging me...

01:15:09.539 --> 01:15:12.273
to pursue science, so I...

01:15:12.342 --> 01:15:14.742
Sweetheart, you know darn well
that is not what I meant.

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:17.311
Can I throw the bomb?

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.782
I really think I should do it.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.285
Yeah, Wy, last time you missed
by a mile.

01:15:24.354 --> 01:15:26.721
And we just have the one, so...

01:15:26.789 --> 01:15:29.891
Okay, but to be fair, I mean,
that was a moving target!

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:32.426
This is... I mean, I can do this.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:36.831
It is more of a drop
than a throw.

01:15:42.171 --> 01:15:43.404
Okay.

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:47.108
I will not let you down, okay?

01:15:49.345 --> 01:15:51.412
Allison Harting, WIQZ.

01:15:51.481 --> 01:15:54.382
I am here on South Harbor
Bridge, where three locals...

01:15:54.450 --> 01:15:57.752
have just gone toe-to-toe
with a pack of sharks, and won.

01:15:58.454 --> 01:16:00.855
It's a shiver of sharks,
actually.

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:04.158
Hey, sharks...

01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:05.826
who's your daddy?

01:16:14.537 --> 01:16:16.504
Oops.

01:16:21.377 --> 01:16:25.479
That was huge! That
totally would have worked!

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:31.452
Allison Harting, WIQZ.

01:16:31.521 --> 01:16:33.387
I am here on South Harbor
Bridge...

01:16:33.456 --> 01:16:37.592
where one man's ineptitude
has just doomed a small town.

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:39.093
All the sharks are out
of the water...

01:16:39.162 --> 01:16:40.861
and all the people are safe.

01:16:40.930 --> 01:16:43.898
I mean, that's the important
part... right?

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:54.842
What's going on?
Why is it falling?

01:16:59.949 --> 01:17:01.282
The wrecker...

01:17:06.756 --> 01:17:09.090
E you at with that lumber?

01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:14.929
Hey, I'm doing you a favor.

01:17:14.998 --> 01:17:17.431
I should be driving a dump truck
right now.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:18.799
<i>Just hurry.</i>

01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:30.945
Helluva day.

01:17:31.014 --> 01:17:32.813
What else could go wrong?

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:42.823
Those brakes aren't holding!

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:45.893
The sharks are heavier
than the truck!

01:17:45.962 --> 01:17:47.294
They're gonna pull it clean
off the wheels!

01:17:47.363 --> 01:17:48.863
What are we gonna do?

01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:53.501
Shark Bite 4!

01:17:53.569 --> 01:17:55.336
Sharkpocalypse Now?

01:17:55.405 --> 01:17:56.604
We need to get them
onto dry land!

01:17:56.673 --> 01:17:57.905
What?

01:17:57.974 --> 01:18:00.641
Come on, it was in the trailer!

01:18:00.710 --> 01:18:02.343
Never mind, we'll watch
it later.

01:18:02.412 --> 01:18:04.645
We need to get that sack
of sharks onto the road.

01:18:04.714 --> 01:18:06.313
Can we do that?

01:18:06.382 --> 01:18:07.481
I mean, we're halfway there...

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:09.750
we just have to get the net
the rest of the way in.

01:18:09.819 --> 01:18:12.720
The rope's as far as it'll go.

01:18:12.789 --> 01:18:15.823
Somebody needs to drive
the wrecker forward.

01:18:15.892 --> 01:18:16.924
Let's do it.

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:21.996
For Jason London.
For Jason London, yes!

01:18:22.065 --> 01:18:24.098
Yeah?

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:27.334
For Jason London.
Yeah.

01:18:27.403 --> 01:18:29.537
Who is Jason London?

01:18:29.605 --> 01:18:31.439
Agh...
Later.

01:18:39.582 --> 01:18:42.049
<i>You are your own hero.</i>

01:18:42.118 --> 01:18:45.219
I am my own hero.

01:18:45.288 --> 01:18:46.921
<i>You will be a lighthouse...</i>

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:48.956
<i>on the rocky shore
of self-doubt.</i>

01:18:49.025 --> 01:18:54.895
I will be a lighthouse on the
rocky shore of self-doubt.

01:19:03.306 --> 01:19:04.505
No.

01:19:09.779 --> 01:19:11.112
You need to go!

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:13.681
It won't start!

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:15.750
Come on! Come on!

01:19:20.022 --> 01:19:23.424
Okay, come on, Belinda,
I have been so good to you.

01:19:23.493 --> 01:19:24.625
I have like oiled you.

01:19:24.694 --> 01:19:26.127
I haven't cleaned you in like
eight years...

01:19:26.195 --> 01:19:27.661
but I've done all kinds
of other stuff.

01:19:27.730 --> 01:19:29.697
If you could just do this one
thing for me.

01:19:36.339 --> 01:19:37.805
Never mind!

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:52.419
Almost there!

01:20:05.168 --> 01:20:07.034
<i>To continue your journey...</i>

01:20:07.103 --> 01:20:10.504
<i>to the best you, turn the tape
to side B.</i>

01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:12.773
Nuts.

01:20:20.817 --> 01:20:24.485
They're on the bridge!
They're on the bridge!

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:31.926
They're on the bridge!

01:20:35.565 --> 01:20:38.065
Easy-peasy.

01:21:07.096 --> 01:21:10.397
Well, um, that works.

01:21:10.933 --> 01:21:15.035
I'd feel bad, but they ate
Mrs. Chapman.

01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:16.904
Really?

01:21:16.973 --> 01:21:19.473
She was such a good customer.

01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:23.711
Yes! How about that?

01:21:24.413 --> 01:21:26.247
All right!

01:21:27.783 --> 01:21:30.184
Allison Harting, WIQZ.

01:21:30.253 --> 01:21:31.886
I am here on South Harbor
Bridge...

01:21:31.954 --> 01:21:34.622
where a gory explosion has just
saved a small town...

01:21:34.690 --> 01:21:38.826
from the terrifying and unlikely
jaws of the Mississippi.

01:21:40.830 --> 01:21:42.696
Didn't hurt.

01:21:42.765 --> 01:21:45.466
A little... you're stronger
than you look.

01:21:45.534 --> 01:21:46.967
Come here!

01:21:52.475 --> 01:21:54.508
Looks like your story is gonna
turn out okay, after all.

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:56.377
I got it!

01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:58.712
I lost my cameraman.

01:21:58.781 --> 01:22:01.315
Yeah. That was bad.

01:22:02.451 --> 01:22:06.720
So... about that coffee...?

01:22:06.789 --> 01:22:09.657
Actually, I don't drink coffee.

01:22:11.127 --> 01:22:12.626
Wait, you're messing with me
again, aren't you?

01:22:12.695 --> 01:22:15.029
You're just so easy.

01:22:32.548 --> 01:22:33.647
Hey, guys!

01:22:36.953 --> 01:22:38.786
Catch of the day!

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:50.097
Wyatt, watch out!

01:22:51.167 --> 01:22:52.533
Agh!

01:22:55.905 --> 01:22:59.039
<i>It's been three months since a
wave of shark attacks rocked...</i>

01:22:59.108 --> 01:23:01.608

<i>Here's Landon with more

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:16.357
Hey, Dad?

01:23:16.425 --> 01:23:18.058
Mitchell!

01:23:18.127 --> 01:23:20.894
Good to see you, Eric.

01:23:20.963 --> 01:23:22.629
You ready to go?

01:23:22.698 --> 01:23:24.732
Almost.

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.869
You're sure you're okay to,
leave the store right now?

01:23:28.938 --> 01:23:31.739
Yeah, I'm gonna let my new
apprentice close up.

01:23:40.716 --> 01:23:44.284
Hey, see you guys later!
Good luck!

01:23:44.353 --> 01:23:45.753
Catch a big one!

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:51.158
I meant, are you okay
leaving him with the guns?

01:23:51.227 --> 01:23:55.796
Well, I don't know about that,
but I'm workin' on it.

01:23:57.400 --> 01:23:58.599
Hey, I'll get the door.

01:23:58.667 --> 01:23:59.733
Thank you, Eric!

01:24:00.836 --> 01:24:02.136
<i>ANNOUNCER He was a beat
cop who'd seen too much.</i>

01:24:17.319 --> 01:24:20.087
Excuse me?

01:24:20.156 --> 01:24:21.388
Do you have a phone
I could borrow?

01:24:21.457 --> 01:24:25.692
My battery is dead and I'm
completely lost.

01:24:25.761 --> 01:24:30.564
Yeah, yeah, we have a...
phone.

01:24:33.135 --> 01:24:35.035
I like your...

01:24:35.104 --> 01:24:37.237
You know what it reminds me of?

01:24:37.306 --> 01:24:39.940
You ever seen the Shark Bite
movies.

01:24:43.379 --> 01:24:46.513
You like the Shark Bite movies?

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:48.816
Yeah, I know they're kind
of silly.

01:24:48.884 --> 01:24:51.919
No, no, no! I love...
I love them.

01:24:51.987 --> 01:24:53.120
Really?

01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:56.090
Yeah, just favorite... they're
kind of my favorite.

01:25:01.764 --> 01:25:05.132
Right, sorry, phone!
Um, yeah, so, there's...

01:25:05.201 --> 01:25:06.800
You know how that works.

01:25:06.869 --> 01:25:08.102
Thanks.

01:25:12.108 --> 01:25:13.540
Not to brag, or anything...

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:15.375
but I just recently fought
off a shiver...

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:17.778
of blood-thirsty sharks
hell-bent on destruction.

01:25:17.847 --> 01:25:19.546
Really?

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:20.681
Yeah.

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:22.416
Me, too.
