00:10.376 --> 00:13.270
I remember
when I was a little girl,

00:13.273 --> 00:16.267
My dada took me to the circus --

00:16.270 --> 00:19.534
The greatest show on earth.

00:19.534 --> 00:24.564
There were clowns and elephants
and dancing bears...

00:24.563 --> 00:27.657
And a beautiful lady
in pink tights

00:27.660 --> 00:30.984
Flew high above our heads.

00:30.991 --> 00:33.726
And as I sat there watching,

00:33.722 --> 00:37.345
I had the feeling
that something was missing.

00:37.352 --> 00:39.208
I don't know what,

00:39.216 --> 00:42.151
But when it was all over,

00:42.147 --> 00:45.640
I said to myself,

00:45.644 --> 00:49.646
"is that all there is
to the circus?"

00:49.640 --> 00:53.104
Uh-oh.
Here comes trouble.

00:54.435 --> 00:58.028
¶ I know what you must be saying
to yourselves ¶

00:58.032 --> 01:01.555
¶ "if that's the way
she feels about it ¶

01:01.562 --> 01:04.596
¶ why doesn't
she just end it all?" ¶

01:04.593 --> 01:06.189
¶ oh, no ¶

01:06.191 --> 01:08.417
Cat's got his tongue.

01:08.423 --> 01:14.182
I'm not ready yet
for that final disappointment.

01:14.184 --> 01:18.506
For I know just as well as I'm
standing here talking to you,

01:18.514 --> 01:21.368
When that final moment comes

01:21.377 --> 01:24.232
And I'm breathing
my last breath...

01:26.272 --> 01:29.536
...I'll be saying to myself,
"is that all?

01:29.537 --> 01:32.461
Is that all there is to dying?"

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074

02:52.127 --> 02:55.321
Ted jr.: Baby, you're not
still mad at me, are you?

02:55.325 --> 02:57.091
Are you?

02:57.089 --> 02:59.485
No, it's okay.

02:59.487 --> 03:01.423
Really, it's fine.

03:01.419 --> 03:04.114
I just couldn't <i> not</i> tell them.
You know?

03:04.116 --> 03:06.851
I know.

03:06.848 --> 03:09.273
I mean,
I just get so excited.

03:09.278 --> 03:12.442
<i> Am</i> excited. Happy.

03:15.606 --> 03:18.001
I'm glad, teddy.
Me too.

03:18.003 --> 03:19.261
Yeah?

03:21.866 --> 03:24.890
Of course I am.

03:24.897 --> 03:28.560
Getting excited
a little bit.

03:28.561 --> 03:30.897
I mean, god's will, right?

03:31.989 --> 03:34.085
Yes.

03:46.110 --> 03:49.504
I love you, tawney.

03:49.508 --> 03:52.332
I know you do.

03:52.338 --> 03:54.434
I love you, too.

03:56.334 --> 03:57.901
Do you?

03:57.901 --> 04:01.294
I do love you, teddy.

04:21.444 --> 04:24.069
Jesus.

04:24.076 --> 04:27.829
How'd you even know
where I lived?

04:27.839 --> 04:30.294
White pages.

04:30.303 --> 04:32.769
oh, yeah.

04:32.769 --> 04:34.406
Those.

04:37.096 --> 04:41.827
It's amazing what survives
and what doesn't, isn't it?

04:41.826 --> 04:43.194
It is.

04:43.192 --> 04:46.885
Well, shit.

04:46.889 --> 04:49.524
What can I do for you,
daniel?

04:49.520 --> 04:53.412
I'm not sure
why today exactly,

04:53.416 --> 04:55.981
But, uh...

04:55.980 --> 04:58.176
I wanted to come
and see you.

04:58.178 --> 05:00.414
Is that right?

05:00.410 --> 05:03.035
To say
"no hard feelings."

05:03.041 --> 05:05.336
All right.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.863
Sure, buddy.

05:07.869 --> 05:09.137
Thanks.

05:12.897 --> 05:15.392
You huff it
all the way over here?

05:17.792 --> 05:19.759
It's not that far.

05:19.759 --> 05:21.725
Not that close, either.

05:23.154 --> 05:25.749
Got anyplace else
you're supposed to be?

05:29.016 --> 05:31.880
Then get your ass
on inside.

05:52.461 --> 05:55.026
Did they give you
grape soda?

05:55.026 --> 05:56.353
Who?

05:56.358 --> 05:57.955
The police.

05:57.956 --> 06:00.012
That night.

06:00.021 --> 06:02.357
"that night"?

06:04.018 --> 06:07.311
Well, damn, daniel,
you just jumping right in, huh?

06:08.812 --> 06:11.946
I'm not even sure, man.

06:11.943 --> 06:16.035
I don't think on it too much
anymore.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.777
Okay.

06:34.422 --> 06:36.089
You thirsty?

06:37.986 --> 06:41.819
My wife got these
for a church thing
she had over here.

06:41.816 --> 06:44.241
They've been
clogging up the fridge.

06:44.247 --> 06:46.104
I figure,
hey, it's Monday morning.

06:46.113 --> 06:48.109
Might as well have
an adult lemonade.

06:58.766 --> 07:01.801
We played tecmo bowl
on this.

07:01.798 --> 07:03.794
You're damn right
we did.

07:03.796 --> 07:05.163
Yeah.

07:05.161 --> 07:07.387
My parents gave it to us
when we got married.

07:07.393 --> 07:09.249
It anchors the room.

07:09.257 --> 07:12.222
So, uh...

07:12.222 --> 07:14.158
What was it like
in there, man?

07:15.884 --> 07:18.319
I mean, I got to ask.
Right?

07:18.316 --> 07:20.082
Confining.

07:20.081 --> 07:21.609
Mm.

07:21.614 --> 07:24.608
That would be the word for it,
I suppose.

07:24.611 --> 07:28.334
Confining in some ways,
but...

07:28.341 --> 07:30.676
Do you still talk
to george?

07:31.769 --> 07:33.935
Damn, that's a sequitur.

07:33.935 --> 07:35.262
George?

07:35.267 --> 07:36.864
George.

07:36.865 --> 07:38.802
I haven't seen
old george in...

07:38.798 --> 07:43.788
Well, we went fishing together
a couple years ago on the flint.

07:43.793 --> 07:45.949
Funny you mention him,
though.

07:45.958 --> 07:49.092
Thought I might
give him a call.

07:49.088 --> 07:53.250
Thought you'd give him a call
or you <i> gave</i> him a call?

07:53.251 --> 07:55.017
Easy there, counselor.

07:55.015 --> 07:57.880
Don't go poking me in the chest
with no question marks.

07:57.880 --> 07:59.946
I gave him a call.

07:59.945 --> 08:01.272
To be nice.

08:01.276 --> 08:04.840
Hadn't heard back.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.734
Where's he live now?

08:07.737 --> 08:09.993
Oh, these are terrible.
You want a beer?

08:11.067 --> 08:15.827
Uh...
Georgey lives in florida.

08:17.094 --> 08:19.260
Live oak.

08:19.260 --> 08:22.224
Satan's butthole, man.

08:25.587 --> 08:28.252
You ain't thinking
about hurting him, are you?

08:30.749 --> 08:33.284
I don't want to hurt
<i> anybody.</i>

08:33.280 --> 08:36.943
'cause I wouldn't want to be
a part of anything like that.

08:36.943 --> 08:38.700
Part of what?

08:38.707 --> 08:42.801
But if you go visit him,
tell him I said "hello."

08:46.002 --> 08:47.540
I will.

08:47.535 --> 08:50.858
Go visit him
or tell him I said "hello"?

08:54.294 --> 08:56.290
Both, I suppose.

08:56.293 --> 08:58.788
I'm not sure.

08:58.790 --> 09:01.614
I should go.

09:03.851 --> 09:06.177
Hey. Hey,
that's, uh...[chuckles]

09:06.184 --> 09:08.719
That's a long ride
down to live oak, buddy.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.212
I'll figure it out.

09:10.213 --> 09:12.748
I'll tell you what.

09:12.744 --> 09:14.072
Hey.

09:17.239 --> 09:19.635
I'm supposed to be
at a job this morning,

09:19.638 --> 09:22.133
But he's a cheap
son of a bitch, really.

09:22.135 --> 09:26.197
What say...
We go on a road trip?

09:26.198 --> 09:28.025
Should we call him first?

09:28.030 --> 09:30.994
Look, that night --

09:30.994 --> 09:33.629
Or that morning, I mean,
with the police --

09:33.625 --> 09:37.747
All I did was say
you and her were arguing.

09:37.754 --> 09:39.511
That's it.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.887
It was george who said --

09:41.816 --> 09:43.643
Hell.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.914
You want to go down
there, you want to talk
with him about it,

09:45.913 --> 09:49.546
As long as you keep it
gentlemanly...

09:51.509 --> 09:54.004
...I am happy
to do the driving.

09:57.968 --> 09:59.465
All right.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.694
Put your little bicycle
in the bed there,

10:01.699 --> 10:03.126
And you grab shotgun.

10:03.131 --> 10:05.028
I'm gonna piss real quick.

10:05.030 --> 10:07.465
And then
we'll hit the road, son!

11:09.637 --> 11:12.401
Tray tables up,
passengers.

11:12.401 --> 11:14.697
Prepare for takeoff.

11:36.944 --> 11:38.142
Oh.

11:38.144 --> 11:39.771
I-I got one for that.

11:39.776 --> 11:41.902
Figured you might.

11:46.536 --> 11:48.742
Your total is $41.20.

11:51.397 --> 11:52.855
One...

11:52.864 --> 11:54.930
Two...

11:54.929 --> 11:56.895
Three...

11:56.893 --> 11:59.488
Four...

12:00.689 --> 12:03.024
Five...

12:03.021 --> 12:06.654
Six...

12:06.651 --> 12:08.408
Seven...

12:08.416 --> 12:10.642
Eight $1s.

12:11.845 --> 12:14.041
Oh, there's that $10.

12:14.044 --> 12:15.701
Yep. There it is.

12:15.710 --> 12:18.474
And...$20.

12:18.473 --> 12:19.811
That's...
$38.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.433
$38?

12:21.438 --> 12:24.372
So I'm...
$3.20 short.

12:24.368 --> 12:25.366
$3.20...?

12:25.367 --> 12:26.665
Short.

12:30.330 --> 12:33.424
I hate to use these,
but...

12:34.924 --> 12:37.449
I don't even know
if that --

12:42.052 --> 12:44.448
Uh...

12:44.450 --> 12:46.675
You still owe 20 cents.

12:48.545 --> 12:50.711
I know I have a quarter
in here.

12:51.909 --> 12:54.774
It's a virginia one.
Got jamestown on it.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.538
Forget it.
God. Forget it.

12:57.537 --> 12:59.633
I will pay the 20 cents.
Not a problem, okay?

13:09.726 --> 13:11.523
What do you know?

13:11.525 --> 13:13.321
Jamestown.

13:19.051 --> 13:21.776
That's right --
right there.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.774
Appreciate you
flipping the bill for those.

13:26.777 --> 13:27.975
Tastes good.

13:27.976 --> 13:31.599
Yeah,
as good as it gets.

13:36.901 --> 13:39.895
Oh, man. Unreal.

13:39.898 --> 13:42.333
I mean, damn!
What?

13:42.329 --> 13:43.857
You son of a bitch!

13:43.862 --> 13:45.918
When I got out of bed
this morning

13:45.927 --> 13:49.390
And I was staring out
that little window
above our commode

13:49.390 --> 13:51.725
At the traffic light
that's out on 39

13:51.721 --> 13:54.746
That is always green
out beyond the hayfield,

13:54.752 --> 13:56.778
I never would have said,
"well, today's the day

13:56.783 --> 13:59.877
That I'm gonna go to florida
with daniel g.D. Holden."

13:59.880 --> 14:01.477
I mean, never.

14:02.977 --> 14:04.903
The light's always green?

14:04.909 --> 14:07.644
I ain't never seen it red.

14:07.640 --> 14:08.937
Not once.

14:08.938 --> 14:10.435
Why's it there?

14:10.437 --> 14:12.404
Hmm.

14:14.233 --> 14:16.359
Some things,
you just don't see coming.

14:17.697 --> 14:19.393
I think you're right.

14:19.395 --> 14:20.992
I <i> am</i> right.

14:25.289 --> 14:27.455
But I'm glad
to be sitting here with you.

14:27.455 --> 14:29.621
Feels right.

14:30.951 --> 14:35.612
Feels like
we're...Going somewhere.

14:35.614 --> 14:39.277
Everything that is good
between men and women

14:39.277 --> 14:41.533
Was written in mud.

14:41.542 --> 14:42.739
And butter.

14:42.740 --> 14:44.367
And barbecue sauce.

14:44.372 --> 14:45.570
You know?
No.

14:47.304 --> 14:50.967
Paula deen said that to me
in a dream I had one time.

14:50.967 --> 14:52.863
Who's paula deen?

14:52.865 --> 14:54.891
Oh, she's a chef on tv.

14:54.896 --> 14:56.892
Well, she <i> was.</i>

14:56.894 --> 14:59.320
Chefs are on tv now,
for some reason.

14:59.326 --> 15:00.523
Mm.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.181
People eat it up.

15:02.190 --> 15:06.721
Anyway, she's just a big ol'
ham hock out of albany, g.A.

15:06.718 --> 15:09.214
She makes southern food
for yankees.

15:09.217 --> 15:11.283
My point is,
in my dream,

15:11.282 --> 15:13.947
I'm white-water rafting
with her, for some reason,

15:13.946 --> 15:17.179
And, um,
she said that to me...

15:17.176 --> 15:20.400
Right before she...
Touched my hamster.

15:21.937 --> 15:24.901
[ laughing ]
but it stuck with me, you know?

15:24.902 --> 15:27.627
It's the only thing from a dream
that ever has.

15:27.633 --> 15:29.789
Do you dream often?

15:29.797 --> 15:31.863
No. Almost never.

15:31.862 --> 15:35.465
I think I sleep more soundly
than anybody I ever met.

15:35.459 --> 15:37.386
In fact, I <i> know</i> I do.

15:39.587 --> 15:42.352
Now, you seem the type
that does a lot of dreaming.

15:42.353 --> 15:45.158
Well, sometimes.

15:45.151 --> 15:47.406
You wake up
and think about them?

15:47.414 --> 15:49.710
Seems like a waste of time
to me.

15:49.713 --> 15:51.669
A waste to think on them?

15:51.677 --> 15:55.340
Once you're awake and walking
around in the real world, yeah.

15:55.341 --> 15:58.136
I mean, once there are things
to actually take care of.

15:58.139 --> 15:59.336
I don't know.

15:59.337 --> 16:01.433
Trying to find meaning
in them --

16:01.435 --> 16:03.731
Trying to find meaning
in <i> anything.</i>

16:03.733 --> 16:06.657
It's a waste of time, if you
really want to get down to it.

16:06.663 --> 16:08.460
So life's meaningless?

16:10.459 --> 16:11.757
<i> Whose</i> life?

16:11.759 --> 16:13.854
Anybody's life,
I suppose.

16:13.857 --> 16:16.323
Isn't that
what you're saying?

16:18.719 --> 16:21.783
Damn, man, you twist things
around like a woman.

16:30.241 --> 16:32.846
Wynn was mad.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.237
Wasn't she?

16:34.238 --> 16:36.863
She all corporate,
you know?

16:36.869 --> 16:38.766
She'll be all right.

16:38.768 --> 16:43.289
Yeah, but I don't like
being like that.

16:51.521 --> 16:54.076
It's been too long
since I smoked.

16:54.087 --> 16:56.612
Exactly -- too long.

16:56.617 --> 16:59.312
No, too long
to do it again.

16:59.315 --> 17:01.251
That'd put me on my ass.

17:01.246 --> 17:04.710
That such a bad thing --
out your head and on your ass?

17:10.405 --> 17:12.431
Can't believe this.

17:12.436 --> 17:14.532
32 years old.

17:18.364 --> 17:21.727
Smoking weed
in the thrifty town parking lot

17:21.728 --> 17:23.753
Where I actually
friggin' work.

17:25.159 --> 17:28.183
How did this happen?

17:30.553 --> 17:33.148
Mm-hmm.

17:33.151 --> 17:35.407
There it is.

17:42.574 --> 17:44.031
Mm.

17:46.271 --> 17:48.437
Just follow
the shiny metal things.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.202
After you, my lady.

17:58.793 --> 18:01.717
I've never bought tires
before.

18:01.724 --> 18:05.158
They've always
just...Been there.

18:11.015 --> 18:13.451
The register used to be
right here.

18:13.447 --> 18:15.373
Mm.

18:15.379 --> 18:17.675
Dad would keep one
of those big-ass metal
flashlights right here,

18:17.677 --> 18:19.703
Just in case he'd need
to take a swing at anyone.

18:23.071 --> 18:27.004
Check in with me next week.
I should have that in for you.

18:27.002 --> 18:29.627
Thank you
for shopping at paulie tire.

18:29.632 --> 18:32.097
I hope
you come back again.

18:32.097 --> 18:33.694
Bye.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.152
Amantha?

18:35.160 --> 18:36.498
Hey.

18:36.493 --> 18:38.758
What are --
what are y'all up to today?

18:38.757 --> 18:41.981
Hey, teddy.
Hope we're not bothering you.

18:41.988 --> 18:44.024
Well, I can't imagine
you're here for tires.

18:44.019 --> 18:45.546
Hey!

18:45.551 --> 18:48.186
Congratulations again
about the baby.

18:48.182 --> 18:50.009
Oh.
Seriously.

18:50.014 --> 18:51.541
Thank you. Yeah.

18:51.546 --> 18:54.540
this is alesha.

18:54.543 --> 18:57.637
And this is
the tire store.

19:04.633 --> 19:06.030
I'm the stepbrother.

19:06.032 --> 19:07.130
Nice to meet you.

19:07.131 --> 19:08.458
Nice to meet you.

19:08.463 --> 19:10.260
We'll get out of your hair
in just a second.

19:10.262 --> 19:13.056
I just wanted
to show her around.

19:13.059 --> 19:15.515
I haven't been here
in so long.

19:15.524 --> 19:18.119
It smells the same.

19:19.986 --> 19:22.681
It's a good smell.

19:22.684 --> 19:25.009
I think about that a lot.

19:25.014 --> 19:27.050
Always smells
the dang same.

19:27.046 --> 19:28.973
Hmm.

19:32.007 --> 19:34.073
I told alesha

19:34.073 --> 19:38.265
That we have the vending machine
to beat all vending machines.

19:38.269 --> 19:39.706
That's true.

19:39.701 --> 19:42.526
We have the chocolate-
and-peanut-butter twix,

19:42.532 --> 19:44.129
So...

19:48.359 --> 19:49.656
She'd like the keys.

19:49.659 --> 19:52.384
Oh. Yeah.
All right.

19:53.488 --> 19:56.382
It's like wonka's factory,
but with rims.

19:57.685 --> 19:59.282
Thank you, teddy.

20:00.914 --> 20:02.152
No problem.

20:02.147 --> 20:04.473
okay.

20:11.572 --> 20:14.097
What would you like?
Number 4, please.

20:14.103 --> 20:16.199
Ahhh!

20:16.201 --> 20:18.028
Here you go.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.568
Okay, okay.
I would like that one, too.

20:30.953 --> 20:32.220
Good afternoon,
mr. Stern.

20:32.219 --> 20:33.577
Good afternoon.

20:33.585 --> 20:36.140
I am on a panel
in half an hour.

20:36.149 --> 20:38.554
Need to do
a little cramming.

20:38.547 --> 20:42.470
I'm sorry -- I don't have
much time to help you prep.

20:42.477 --> 20:45.112
I'm supposed to be on a plane
in a couple of hours.

20:45.108 --> 20:46.575
This is
nothing official yet,

20:46.573 --> 20:48.469
But I asked you
to meet me here today

20:48.471 --> 20:50.497
Because
I am now willing --

20:50.502 --> 20:52.898
Begrudgingly,
but willing --

20:52.901 --> 20:55.466
To discuss the possibility of
a plea deal for daniel holden.

21:02.524 --> 21:04.490
I'm all ears.

21:04.489 --> 21:08.152
Time served plus 10,
15 more probation.

21:08.153 --> 21:09.551
He's not doing more time.

21:09.552 --> 21:11.548
One way or another,
he's going back inside, jon.

21:11.550 --> 21:14.145
Only thing left to discuss
is how long.

21:14.148 --> 21:15.974
10 years is
not a discussion.

21:15.979 --> 21:17.846
How about life?

21:17.845 --> 21:20.340
If you really wanted
to go to trial, you
wouldn't be offering --

21:20.342 --> 21:23.007
I'm not scared
to go back to trial.

21:23.006 --> 21:24.503
That dna's out there now.

21:24.505 --> 21:27.070
Gonna be hard to answer
for that -- multiple samples.

21:27.069 --> 21:29.864
And he confessed --
on the record.

21:29.867 --> 21:32.492
And it's gonna be hard to argue
that it was coerced

21:32.498 --> 21:34.594
Above the sound
of the tape rolling --

21:34.596 --> 21:37.031
The sound of him
saying that he did it.

21:37.027 --> 21:39.322
What if we get that confession
thrown out?

21:44.085 --> 21:46.820
If you think
I see zero chance

21:46.818 --> 21:48.914
Of getting another conviction
at trial,

21:48.916 --> 21:50.912
I'm here to dissuade you
of that notion.

21:50.914 --> 21:52.581
You and your client
should be terrified

21:52.579 --> 21:54.505
Of stepping foot
in a courtroom.

21:54.510 --> 21:57.165
I'm throwing you a lifeline
here.

21:57.175 --> 21:58.503
Time plus 10.

21:58.507 --> 22:02.838
Now you say "thank you,"
you go tell your client,

22:02.836 --> 22:04.433
And you don't make this
difficult.

22:04.434 --> 22:06.430
I'll talk with my client.

22:06.432 --> 22:09.297
You do that --
quickly and quietly.

22:09.297 --> 22:11.792
This isn't gonna be
drawn out.

22:11.795 --> 22:13.831
Sorry to make you
miss a flight.

22:38.003 --> 22:40.069
His truck's here.

22:45.462 --> 22:48.087
Hey, grab them beers.

22:55.420 --> 22:58.285
Damn.

22:58.285 --> 23:01.149
Boy's got a lot of nerve --
not being home

23:01.149 --> 23:03.944
After we drove all this way
just to have a beer with him.

23:03.947 --> 23:06.442
Should have called,
I guess.

23:06.444 --> 23:09.209
I'm gonna go
check the back.

23:39.413 --> 23:41.908
Back door is open!

23:49.439 --> 23:51.165
Come on in.

23:51.170 --> 23:52.368
Is he here?

23:52.369 --> 23:54.335
Doesn't look like it.

23:54.333 --> 23:55.930
S-should we --

23:55.932 --> 23:58.198
Wait out here
in the sun? No.

23:58.197 --> 23:59.824
Screw that, buddy.
Come on.

24:11.051 --> 24:13.876
Did you check
in the back?

24:13.883 --> 24:15.310
I didn't even think to.

24:17.111 --> 24:18.379
Hey, george!

24:46.884 --> 24:50.917
Courtesy of
melton pharmaceuticals!

24:50.915 --> 24:53.410
George won't mind!

24:53.413 --> 24:55.648
It's like old times!

25:07.066 --> 25:09.661
Um...
What are you doing?

25:09.665 --> 25:12.988
Um...Drinking a beer,
making spaghetti.

25:12.995 --> 25:14.931
Did you miss your flight?

25:14.926 --> 25:17.022
Come kiss me.

25:17.024 --> 25:18.222
What's going on?

25:18.223 --> 25:20.189
Come here.

25:25.216 --> 25:27.042
What?

25:28.180 --> 25:30.236
Are you high?

25:30.245 --> 25:31.902
Maybe.

25:34.609 --> 25:36.964
Amantha holden,
you rule breaker.

25:36.973 --> 25:39.598
Mm.
Just don't tell daggett.

25:39.604 --> 25:41.301
Oh, I won't.

25:41.302 --> 25:44.605
No, but, seriously --
what's up?

25:44.599 --> 25:46.356
I can't tell you.

25:46.364 --> 25:50.087
You can't say
you can't tell me.

25:50.094 --> 25:52.589
I <i> shouldn't</i> tell you.

25:52.592 --> 25:53.850
Not yet.

25:56.753 --> 25:57.961
What is it, jon?

25:57.954 --> 26:00.080
They want
to arrest him again.

26:00.085 --> 26:01.782
Amantha.
Oh, my god.

26:01.783 --> 26:04.748
They're gonna put him
back on trial. I knew --
no.

26:04.747 --> 26:07.082
What do you mean "no"?

26:08.809 --> 26:10.107
What?

26:10.109 --> 26:13.133
They want to offer him
a plea deal.

26:13.140 --> 26:15.006
A plea deal?

26:16.901 --> 26:18.199
A plea deal?

26:19.766 --> 26:21.163
What do they want?

26:21.165 --> 26:23.730
Well, they want him
to plead guilty, obviously.

26:23.729 --> 26:25.596
And?
And...

26:25.595 --> 26:28.290
10 more years.

26:28.293 --> 26:31.327
No.
No! "f" that, jon!

26:31.323 --> 26:33.319
It can all be negotiated.
That's just where they started.

26:34.320 --> 26:35.588
Wait.

26:36.783 --> 26:39.219
They're offering
a way out.

26:39.216 --> 26:40.613
Of sorts, yeah.

26:40.614 --> 26:42.211
They don't think
they can win.

26:42.213 --> 26:44.039
W-why else would they be
talking like this?

26:44.044 --> 26:45.641
You know
it's not that simple.

26:45.643 --> 26:47.639
Daniel's gonna think
they're folding, too. Call him.

26:47.641 --> 26:48.969
I <i> have</i> been.

26:48.973 --> 26:51.538
And he's not
calling me back.

26:55.766 --> 26:58.730
God, what a buzzkill.

26:58.731 --> 27:00.697
Yep.

27:16.047 --> 27:18.283
Senator. Carl.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.575
This is a surprise.

27:20.577 --> 27:22.244
How you doing,
ted?

27:22.243 --> 27:24.199
I don't know yet.

27:24.207 --> 27:27.701
Teddy, I want you to know that
I absolutely felt like I had to.

27:29.135 --> 27:30.832
Christ, carl.

27:30.834 --> 27:32.032
Why?

27:32.033 --> 27:34.259
It's just us now,
teddy.

27:34.265 --> 27:35.832
"just us," what?

27:35.830 --> 27:37.227
God damn it, carl.

27:37.229 --> 27:39.824
He didn't want to betray
your confidence, son,

27:39.826 --> 27:41.782
But it was
the right thing to do.

27:41.791 --> 27:43.758
It wasn't easy,
but it was right.

27:43.756 --> 27:45.722
Right for who?

27:45.721 --> 27:47.987
We want you
to come forward.

27:47.986 --> 27:51.519
We need you
to press charges.

27:51.516 --> 27:53.472
There's no way
I'd do that.

27:53.481 --> 27:54.808
No way in hell.

27:54.812 --> 27:57.737
You need to think
about the next person

27:57.743 --> 27:59.639
That daniel
has a problem with.

27:59.641 --> 28:01.907
You think
this was a two-time thing?

28:01.906 --> 28:03.633
What he did to hanna?

28:03.638 --> 28:05.574
What he did to you?

28:05.570 --> 28:08.165
That he's gonna stop,
like he's cured or something?

28:08.167 --> 28:10.033
He has
these compulsions, ted.

28:10.032 --> 28:11.959
It's as if
he can't help himself.

28:11.964 --> 28:15.896
Look, we got in an argument
that night.

28:15.893 --> 28:18.089
Things got out of hand.

28:18.091 --> 28:20.656
That's all.

28:23.518 --> 28:25.514
What about your stepmama?

28:26.849 --> 28:28.845
Your daddy,
your -- your little brother?

28:28.848 --> 28:31.214
They're all living
under the same roof
with him, aren't they?

28:31.213 --> 28:33.179
He'd never hurt mom.

28:33.178 --> 28:35.643
And what about your wife?

28:39.137 --> 28:41.134
This little argument
was about her, initially.

28:41.136 --> 28:45.468
You don't want to put her
in any future danger, do you?

28:45.466 --> 28:47.762
That son of a bitch is never
gonna be alone with her again.

28:47.764 --> 28:50.459
I can promise you that.

29:05.014 --> 29:07.569
This would
rip my family apart.

29:09.809 --> 29:12.504
Rip them apart.

29:15.971 --> 29:18.576
My mom...

29:18.569 --> 29:20.695
My dad...

29:20.701 --> 29:22.836
Everybody.

29:25.528 --> 29:27.055
It'd be over.

29:30.623 --> 29:32.719
I feel for you, son.

29:32.722 --> 29:35.118
I do.

29:35.121 --> 29:38.055
But this is bigger
than you --

29:38.051 --> 29:40.706
Bigger than your family,
even.

29:42.413 --> 29:45.577
In a way,
it's -- it's out of your hands.

29:45.578 --> 29:47.574
O-out of <i> all</i> of our hands.

30:04.726 --> 30:06.123
I made it up.

30:09.555 --> 30:11.691
I mean, uh...

30:11.687 --> 30:13.713
We got into an argument
that night.

30:13.719 --> 30:15.785
That -- that part's true.

30:17.914 --> 30:21.108
But the rest of it,
I just...

30:21.112 --> 30:22.679
Made up.

30:22.677 --> 30:25.741
Why would you make
something like that up, son?

30:25.741 --> 30:27.936
I don't know.

30:27.938 --> 30:31.032
'cause I was drunk,
I guess.

30:31.035 --> 30:33.601
I made a mistake.

30:33.600 --> 30:36.833
Now, if you'll all excuse me,
I got to close the shop up.

30:40.060 --> 30:42.515
This ain't going away,
ted.

30:42.525 --> 30:44.052
The truth never does.

30:44.057 --> 30:45.824
That <i> is</i> the truth.

30:45.822 --> 30:47.788
Now, if you'll all
excuse me...

31:08.368 --> 31:11.831
You think we ought
to work our way up
the talbot family tree?

31:11.831 --> 31:14.656
Ted sr.?

31:14.663 --> 31:17.527
I don't know about that,
roland.

31:17.526 --> 31:19.922
You don't have to.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.731
I had an uncle who went
bat-shit -- just lost it.

31:49.730 --> 31:53.822
A cousin,
I guess it was --<i> is.</i>

31:53.826 --> 31:54.964
How'd he lose it?

31:54.958 --> 31:58.721
He's my dad's
second cousin.

31:58.722 --> 32:00.718
He's old now.

32:00.720 --> 32:04.782
So, he's <i> your</i> second cousin,
too.

32:04.782 --> 32:06.379
What?

32:06.381 --> 32:10.014
Your dad's second cousin
is <i> your</i> second cousin,

32:10.011 --> 32:12.736
Only once removed.

32:15.539 --> 32:16.766
Yeah.

32:16.771 --> 32:20.933
Anyway, he just lost it
one day, man.

32:20.934 --> 32:22.471
That can happen.

32:22.466 --> 32:26.628
He was, uh, artsy --
real artsy for a while.

32:26.629 --> 32:30.552
You know, however artsy
you can be in spartanburg.

32:30.559 --> 32:33.853
He was always, um,
putting on plays

32:33.856 --> 32:37.319
And...
Lots of spanish stuff.

32:37.320 --> 32:38.548
Lorca?

32:38.552 --> 32:40.288
Sure. Doesn't matter.

32:40.283 --> 32:43.407
Lorca was shot
on the side of the road

32:43.414 --> 32:46.309
A month
into the spanish civil war.

32:46.312 --> 32:49.775
Well, my dad's cousin
stabbed a librarian in the face

32:49.775 --> 32:51.971
Three days into 1981.

32:56.368 --> 32:57.526
Where's them mints at?

32:57.534 --> 32:59.570
Behind the at.

33:01.430 --> 33:03.556
all right. Okay.

33:03.563 --> 33:07.525
Little -- little egg-shaped
blue one.

33:07.525 --> 33:09.761
Take you one.

33:12.221 --> 33:13.818
Them yellows never took.

33:13.819 --> 33:16.484
Or maybe they did.

33:16.484 --> 33:19.448
Shake the cobwebs off.

33:21.444 --> 33:23.410
What time is it?

33:23.410 --> 33:25.676
You don't have to do time
no more.

33:27.572 --> 33:30.766
I'm gonna --
I'm gonna call...

33:30.770 --> 33:33.166
Who you got to call?

33:33.169 --> 33:34.596
your mama?

33:36.898 --> 33:38.734
You do!
you do!

33:38.730 --> 33:41.624
you got to call your mama!

33:43.324 --> 33:45.919
You're -- you're like
a time machine

33:45.923 --> 33:48.748
That don't go nowhere --
but backwards!

33:52.550 --> 33:56.312
Hey, you want me
to turn down the jams?

33:56.313 --> 33:58.240
So she's not
worried about you

33:58.246 --> 34:00.841
being around a bad element?

34:00.843 --> 34:04.905
Tell her
<i> you</i> are the bad element.

34:04.906 --> 34:09.168
I was just a kid back then.

34:09.168 --> 34:13.620
I never understood why
he did it -- my second cousin.

34:13.630 --> 34:16.255
Once removed.

34:16.262 --> 34:18.458
I remember
my family being horrified.

34:21.157 --> 34:24.750
Didn't understand that,
either...Be honest.

34:24.754 --> 34:27.349
<i> I</i> wasn't horrified.

34:27.351 --> 34:30.315
I was like, "wow.

34:30.315 --> 34:32.312
Wish I'd seen them plays."

34:32.313 --> 34:33.542
Hey!

34:33.545 --> 34:36.170
Mama happy now?

34:37.873 --> 34:40.629
Mm? Mm...

35:00.621 --> 35:02.417
She was a bitch, man.

35:03.851 --> 35:05.248
Who?

35:05.250 --> 35:06.617
Hanna.

35:07.747 --> 35:10.172
Bitch and a slut.

35:10.179 --> 35:12.345
Oh, don't say that.

35:12.343 --> 35:14.838
Ain't that
why we're here?

35:14.841 --> 35:17.077
To fill in the blanks?

35:22.601 --> 35:26.822
You swear on a stack of bibles
you don't remember?

35:26.830 --> 35:28.527
Remember what?

35:28.529 --> 35:29.727
What the hell happened!

35:29.728 --> 35:31.125
No.

35:31.126 --> 35:33.122
You don't remember
raping her,

35:33.124 --> 35:34.791
Like your buddy george
testified?

35:36.188 --> 35:38.624
I don't remember
raping her, no.

35:38.620 --> 35:41.414
That's because
you <i> didn't</i> rape her, daniel.

35:44.380 --> 35:47.743
You didn't even screw her,
bud.

35:47.744 --> 35:50.210
You couldn't get it up,
man.

35:52.806 --> 35:55.301
Or did you block out
that part, too?

35:55.304 --> 35:58.138
How would you know that?

35:58.135 --> 36:02.367
She told me -- after you ran off
all weirded out.

36:02.364 --> 36:04.790
Why would she
tell you that?

36:04.796 --> 36:08.728
I popped hanna's cherry
when she was 13.

36:08.725 --> 36:11.789
Well, her uncle did before,
but outside of family, I mean...

36:11.789 --> 36:14.624
You're lying.

36:14.620 --> 36:17.744
I knew her way better
than you did, daniel.

36:17.751 --> 36:20.685
I never understood why you
thought she was so damn special.

36:20.681 --> 36:22.078
She <i> was</i> special.

36:22.079 --> 36:25.114
Okay, buddy.
She was special.

36:25.111 --> 36:28.474
But you, uh, do remember

36:28.474 --> 36:31.169
Not being able to get it up now,
don't you?

36:31.171 --> 36:33.566
I don't...

36:33.569 --> 36:36.065
Know.

36:36.067 --> 36:39.989
We were up there
watching the whole thing --

36:39.997 --> 36:42.592
You yelling at her
'cause you were embarrassed

36:42.594 --> 36:44.121
And her laughing.

36:44.126 --> 36:46.252
I mean,
she wasn't laughing at you.

36:46.257 --> 36:49.082
She was just laughing.
She was tripping.

36:49.089 --> 36:51.584
Everything was funny
to her,

36:51.586 --> 36:54.221
Especially
you all dick-puny mad.

36:54.217 --> 36:56.313
I thought she <i> told</i> you
what happened,

36:56.315 --> 36:58.680
Not you <i> saw</i> what happened.

36:58.679 --> 37:00.745
She <i> did</i> tell me.

37:00.744 --> 37:05.206
See, we came down to her
after you left --

37:05.207 --> 37:09.967
Her still naked as a jaybird
on that blanket.

37:09.969 --> 37:12.335
That girl
never did like clothes.

37:12.334 --> 37:14.500
Oh, man.

37:14.498 --> 37:17.462
You know,
you just can't realize

37:17.462 --> 37:21.295
How pretty a 16-year-old girl is
when you're that age.

37:21.292 --> 37:25.114
[ laughing ]
I just wish I had me
a backwards-only time machine.

37:25.121 --> 37:26.988
Don't talk anymore.

37:28.717 --> 37:30.514
Okay.

37:30.517 --> 37:32.284
Sure, buddy.

37:32.282 --> 37:35.505
Want to just wait around
and listen to music

37:35.512 --> 37:38.606
And wait for george?

37:41.240 --> 37:43.306
George ain't coming.

37:43.305 --> 37:46.270
Betcha $5 you're right.

37:59.356 --> 38:02.190
Did you kill her, trey?

38:04.084 --> 38:06.350
Come on, man.

38:06.350 --> 38:08.985
You really think
I'd incriminate myself?

38:08.981 --> 38:11.376
You might be wired
or something.

38:15.974 --> 38:17.680
I had no motive, daniel.

38:17.673 --> 38:20.398
She didn't mean <i> anything</i>
to me.

38:20.404 --> 38:24.406
Besides that, I could have
gotten it anytime I wanted.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.556
So what would have been
the point?

38:26.565 --> 38:30.628
You can't
tell anybody this.

38:30.629 --> 38:32.255
Swear?

38:32.260 --> 38:34.955
Sure.

38:37.055 --> 38:40.948
I let old melton suck me off
a couple times back then,

38:40.952 --> 38:42.948
When there were
no girls around.

38:42.950 --> 38:47.042
He was a weird one, too --
weird as you.

38:48.444 --> 38:49.941
"was"?

38:51.507 --> 38:52.905
Yeah.

38:52.908 --> 38:55.133
"was."

38:55.138 --> 38:57.474
Maybe he's had therapy
or something. I don't know.

38:57.470 --> 39:01.263
But, hell,
george could have killed her.

39:01.267 --> 39:05.069
He had
some pent-up issues, man.

39:06.994 --> 39:11.126
He shot a cat
with a .410.

39:11.124 --> 39:13.190
You're full of shit.

39:21.214 --> 39:25.107
No, it had to be you.

39:25.111 --> 39:27.107
Nothing else is logical.

39:27.109 --> 39:30.972
You tell me why
I don't remember doing it, trey,

39:30.973 --> 39:33.168
If you have
all the answers.

39:34.836 --> 39:38.230
Well, that ain't the question
that's bugging me.

39:38.233 --> 39:42.325
My question is, why would you
say that you did it

39:42.329 --> 39:45.822
If you didn't
or if you didn't remember?

39:45.826 --> 39:50.517
They made me believe
that I <i> had...</i>

39:50.521 --> 39:52.358
For a while.

39:52.353 --> 39:55.546
Made you believe
or made you remember?

40:02.143 --> 40:04.209
You know what?
I believe you.

40:04.209 --> 40:06.205
I actually believe you.

40:06.207 --> 40:08.233
Believe what?

40:08.238 --> 40:10.903
That you don't remember.

40:12.567 --> 40:15.431
But I sure as hell don't believe
you didn't do it.

40:26.888 --> 40:29.413
I saw you up there
watching us.

40:29.418 --> 40:30.916
I wasn't up there.

40:30.918 --> 40:33.273
Aw, sure you were.

40:33.282 --> 40:36.875
With her grabbing everything
put in her face --

40:36.879 --> 40:39.175
Just grabbing it
and touching it

40:39.177 --> 40:42.311
And kissing it and sucking it
like it wasn't even real.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.003
Shut up, trey!

40:44.005 --> 40:45.872
I'm not saying
it was a bad thing, man.

40:45.871 --> 40:47.368
It was kind of cute,
really.

40:47.369 --> 40:50.233
I mean, her just being free,
you know,

40:50.233 --> 40:53.797
And not caught up in
any of that morality bullshit.

40:53.797 --> 40:57.260
I guess she kind of <i> was</i> special,
in a way.

40:57.260 --> 41:00.124
She wouldn't do that.

41:00.124 --> 41:03.049
Damn, you're old-fashioned
sometimes, daniel.

41:03.055 --> 41:04.352
You forced her to do it.

41:04.353 --> 41:06.349
Forced her?
Hell, she loved it.

41:06.351 --> 41:08.418
I wasn't up there.

41:08.417 --> 41:10.413
You know, at first, I thought
you were digging on it,

41:10.415 --> 41:14.307
But then, later,
I realized you were paralyzed.

41:14.311 --> 41:15.509
[ bottle thuds ]

41:15.510 --> 41:17.506
That never happened.
Not like that.

41:17.508 --> 41:19.065
You know what?

41:19.073 --> 41:22.127
If it'd been me,
I would have gone down there

41:22.137 --> 41:25.730
And killed every son of a bitch
who put anything inside of her.

41:25.734 --> 41:29.058
But you, man,
you just...

41:29.064 --> 41:31.220
You just waited
for us to leave,

41:31.229 --> 41:34.233
And then
you killed <i> her</i> instead.

41:37.723 --> 41:40.089
Hey!

41:44.183 --> 41:48.145
you're a psycho killer.

41:48.146 --> 41:51.180
I mean, look at that --
right there.

41:51.177 --> 41:54.311
I mean, who throws a guy
into a wall?!

41:54.307 --> 41:56.363
Let me up!

41:56.372 --> 41:58.229
Let me up!!

42:00.101 --> 42:01.269
Get off me.

42:09.992 --> 42:12.687
Oh.

42:12.691 --> 42:14.448
I'm gonna let <i> you</i>
explain that to georgey.

42:14.456 --> 42:17.220
That one's on you.

42:19.017 --> 42:20.314
Is those yellows working?

42:20.316 --> 42:22.043
Let's take another one.

42:34.736 --> 42:36.732
Remember?

42:36.735 --> 42:40.398
You are...Who you are.

42:40.399 --> 42:41.796
Okay?

42:41.797 --> 42:44.223
It's forever.

42:46.159 --> 42:49.023
It's like being an indian
or something.

43:04.010 --> 43:06.704
I know you.

43:12.669 --> 43:14.396
Now <i> you</i> know you.

43:16.999 --> 43:20.093
If you ever really forgot.
