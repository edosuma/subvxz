00:06.798 --> 00:08.710
is a witness
who is willing to testify

00:08.800 --> 00:11.417
that you are the Green Arrow.
It's someone on the team.

00:11.803 --> 00:14.090
Dinah isn't the witness, Oliver,
it's me.

00:14.181 --> 00:15.467
You're off the team.

It's been real, y'all.

Mr. Bertinelli, I think you're gonna
like these numbers.

01:25.794 --> 01:27.251
I have heard

01:27.462 --> 01:32.002
that sometimes ships appear
on your docking manifest,

01:32.092 --> 01:33.799
but never actually arrive.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.970
Sometimes ships arrive

01:37.222 --> 01:39.339
and never end up
on the docking manifest.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.550
Well, it's very profound.

01:42.978 --> 01:47.643
If the price is right, maybe,
maybe we can facilitate a few things.

- Another strikeout.

have inserted some sort of Trojan

11:17.218 --> 11:19.756
I have a long memory for
these sorts of things, call me crazy.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.964
Two nights ago they paid him a visit.
This is the security footage.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.514
They made a threat against
his daughter.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.058
Well, what's on here
might help us locate them.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.225
That's the plan.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.344
Well, we'll know
about the license plate.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.605
Old school. I like it.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.819
A little bit of old school
combined with some new school,

11:37.906 --> 11:40.068
and I'm about to find us
this Cayden James needle

11:40.158 --> 11:41.319
in the Star City haystack.

11:41.659 --> 11:43.070
Do it.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.453
I mean, I was thinking after school
we could hit up the zoo.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.373
They have this new reptile room
with a Komodo dragon.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.704
Thing's so big, it could eat a cow.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.294
- That's dope, right?
- I guess so.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.500
What's up, sweets?

11:56.758 --> 11:58.715
I thought you were all about
this animal stuff.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.504
I am, but...

12:00.845 --> 12:02.427
Why aren't you going to work today?

12:03.056 --> 12:06.299
I'm going through
a little transitional period.

12:06.392 --> 12:08.805
- Will I have to leave again?
- Hey...

12:12.815 --> 12:16.058

away from me.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.901
I brought crogurts.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.155
- "Crogurts"?
- I didn't name them. I just eat them.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.865
- Hey, Zoe.
- Hi, Curtis.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.916
Hey, go get your bag.
We're about to leave.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.127

You don't look like you're feeling
the best feeling in the world though.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.721
I can't shake how everything
went down with Oliver.

12:46.641 --> 12:49.509
In order to do right for me,
I had to betray him.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.140
You had to put your daughter first.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.892
She's family.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.558
Is that why you called me over?

12:58.111 --> 13:00.649
Actually, I was thinking...

13:01.447 --> 13:04.656
All the evidence Agent Watson said
she has against me

13:04.742 --> 13:06.199
has to be digitized, right?

13:07.203 --> 13:09.069
- Yeah.
- So what if

13:09.163 --> 13:11.701
that evidence suddenly vanished?

13:12.083 --> 13:13.915
Then I'll be able to... (SIGHS)

- You put your family first, Rene.

13:19.924 --> 13:21.506
That's nothing
to be ashamed of about.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.544
I mean, now, accessing the files
might be a little easier

13:25.638 --> 13:29.131
now that the case has been moved back
to the Star City DA, but...

13:29.350 --> 13:31.467
So, that's a yes...

13:31.561 --> 13:34.269
No, that's a "Let me think about it."

13:36.649 --> 13:38.231

We all know I'll do it.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.150

That's what I'm talking about, hoss.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.987
(LAUGHING) That was
the worst stakeout of my life.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.690
Do you remember, it was like, what?
Minus one?

13:46.784 --> 13:49.401
It was freezing.
I was freezing my ass off

13:49.495 --> 13:50.736
and the car's heater broke down.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.914

- Yeah, you did and I didn't listen.

in there somewhere.

I think I drank a gallon of coffee
that night to stay warm.

14:01.632 --> 14:05.251
I had to pee so...
I never had to pee so bad in my life.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.382
And I had to go back behind the car.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.384

I wasn't gonna ask the scumbag

14:09.474 --> 14:10.965

Oh, God, and the second
I go back there,

he decides to make a run for it.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.889

I had to go chasing after him,

That's insane. That's insane.

22:45.739 --> 22:47.401
Vince hunts criminals,
he doesn't throw down with them.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.153
Oliver saw him
with James and the rest.

22:49.243 --> 22:52.736
Well, excuse me if, uh, I don't
just take Oliver's word for it.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.787
I mean, keeping us
under surveillance,

22:55.499 --> 22:57.991
sounds like he and Cayden James
have a lot in common.

22:58.085 --> 23:01.249
Rene, we did that
for the good of the team.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.374
Oh.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.830
Is that how you sleep at night, John?

23:05.593 --> 23:08.882
We were facing
an actual breach in security.

23:09.513 --> 23:10.629
You guys gave up on Oliver.

23:10.723 --> 23:13.306
You don't get to stay mad at Daddy
because he read your diary

23:13.392 --> 23:14.883
and you get to
just skip out on curfew.

23:14.977 --> 23:16.263
That's not the way it works.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.219
I'm getting sick and tired
of you talking to me

23:18.314 --> 23:19.771
like I did what I did on a whim.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.561
I did it for my daughter.

23:22.651 --> 23:25.109
And your choice
put the whole team in jeopardy, Rene.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.983
We think that showed us
where you stand.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.527
- Dinah.
- Where are you going, Dinah?

23:30.618 --> 23:32.154
Out. I'm not gonna sit here

23:32.244 --> 23:34.452
and watch you two point fingers
at everybody but yourselves.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.412
(DOOR SLAMS SHUT)

23:50.179 --> 23:53.297
Move, or get moved, hoodie.

23:53.641 --> 23:57.260
Hey, stand down.
He's a friend of mine.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.845
Well, he's an, uh, acquaintance.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.644
Business associate? What do you need?

24:03.943 --> 24:05.275
You going somewhere?

24:05.361 --> 24:09.651
I got a, uh, text sent to me tonight
from inside my daughter's dorm room.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.362
Cayden James, he can have the port.

24:13.452 --> 24:14.693
You're running scared.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.325
I'm gonna run anywhere
for my baby girl, all right?

24:17.623 --> 24:19.831
As long as James and this crew
are out there,

24:19.917 --> 24:21.408
she will never be safe.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.077
Neither will you.

24:24.171 --> 24:27.084
- But?
- But I can stop them.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.128
With your help.

24:29.510 --> 24:32.002
Listen to me, you do what I say,

24:33.847 --> 24:35.930
we can end Cayden James.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.648
- I'm so glad you wanted to meet again.
- (GRUNTS)

24:48.195 --> 24:50.357
Cayden James.

24:51.407 --> 24:54.491
- You don't understand.
- You lying son of a bitch.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.073
You were just getting close to me
for him.

24:58.998 --> 25:02.207
Dinah, can we talk about this
somewhere else?

25:03.752 --> 25:05.209
That's a great idea, Vince.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.537
Precinct has a really nice room
for you.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.418
Really nice interrogation room.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.083
I can't let you do this.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.257
I should've taken you in

25:12.344 --> 25:13.835
the second you came back
into my life.

25:15.723 --> 25:16.759
(GRUNTS)

25:20.644 --> 25:21.725
I'm sorry.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.407
(DEVICE BEEPS)

25:41.123 --> 25:42.409
Charges are in place.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.706
So are mine.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.497
Oliver. You sure about this, man?

25:48.088 --> 25:49.624
Doesn't sound like you are.

25:49.715 --> 25:50.751
(SIGHS)

25:51.258 --> 25:54.842
If we do this, Cayden James
will bring his whole group here.

25:54.928 --> 25:56.089
And?

25:56.180 --> 25:57.887
And Cayden
will bring everyone, Oliver.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.680
I'm no place close to 100%.

25:59.767 --> 26:02.510
But, look, the rest of the team...

26:02.603 --> 26:04.845
- There is no "rest of the team."
- Oliver, we could use their help.

26:04.938 --> 26:05.928
All you have to do is ask.

26:06.023 --> 26:07.605
We would have to trust them
and we can't.

26:08.025 --> 26:09.766
We can't. John, we've been over this.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.477
I know. But we've also
been over other things.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.860
Like you in the League of Assassins,
me, with my secret.

26:15.949 --> 26:18.692
Oliver, the best partnerships
are built on forgiveness, man.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.072
No one knows that
more than you and me.

26:21.371 --> 26:22.828
I got arrested in front of my son.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.578
Got dragged away in handcuffs
because of something that Rene did.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.158
I don't know how to forgive him.

26:27.628 --> 26:28.744
I tried.

26:29.546 --> 26:32.755
John, more importantly,
what's Cayden James up to?

26:33.133 --> 26:34.340
We don't know.

26:34.718 --> 26:37.677
He has known our identities
for months.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.221
He hasn't outed us. Why?

26:41.225 --> 26:44.593
This started with you, with me,
and with Felicity.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.895
Whatever comes our way,
we can handle it.

26:49.108 --> 26:50.144
I believe that.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.580
Are you actually eating
the old crogurt?

27:05.666 --> 27:07.828
Shut up. Your old is my delicious.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.534
- How's Zoe?
- I don't know.

27:09.628 --> 27:13.247
I just need her to feel like
everything's going back to normal.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.547
I hope it is.

27:14.842 --> 27:16.959
It'll help if you could delete
whatever the DA's got.

27:18.220 --> 27:19.961
We just found out that Cayden James
had the bunker bugged

27:20.055 --> 27:21.045
for a couple of months,

27:21.140 --> 27:22.221
so maybe we should just
take a little break

27:22.307 --> 27:23.798
on saying incriminating things
like that out loud.

27:23.892 --> 27:26.805
All right, all right. I'm sorry.
I'm just anxious is all.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.602
(SIGHS) I know.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.351
Unfortunately, they have a backup
of all these files

27:31.441 --> 27:35.230
and, even worse, their records are
saying that they have hard copies.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.606
Damn.

27:36.697 --> 27:39.405
Yeah. No, but I'm inside the system.
I'm just trying to find anything...

27:39.491 --> 27:41.073
- Whoa.
- "Whoa," what?

27:41.160 --> 27:43.072
I think I just found something. Yeah.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.154
There's a record on how Watson
found out you were Wild Dog.

27:45.247 --> 27:47.330
- There's an audio recording.
- You thinking what I'm thinking?

27:47.416 --> 27:48.623
Well, that depends
on if you're thinking

27:48.709 --> 27:49.825
that Cayden James
leaked an audio file

27:49.918 --> 27:51.409
of you from the bunker to the FBI.

27:51.545 --> 27:52.626
Is that what you're thinking?
That's what you're thinking, right?

27:52.713 --> 27:54.454
- Yeah.
- Okay, we're on the same page.

27:57.050 --> 27:58.086
Don't you knock?

27:58.177 --> 27:59.634
Don't you lock your doors?

27:59.720 --> 28:01.086
You look like
you were just in a fight.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.546
You were just in a fight.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.005
- With who?
- Vince.

28:04.183 --> 28:06.470
I confronted him.
He did this and ran.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.176
I'm so sorry, Dinah.

28:08.270 --> 28:10.933
It was my fault for believing in him
in the first damn place.

28:11.023 --> 28:12.059
And for confronting him,

28:12.149 --> 28:13.981
exposing the fact that we know
about him and Cayden James.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.478
That's my fault, too. It's great.

28:15.569 --> 28:17.435
Curtis and I
were just talking about James

28:17.571 --> 28:18.778
and the bunker being compromised.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.865
Yeah, and how that might have
led to Rene being compromised.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.862
You think Cayden provided
Samandra Watson with her case?

28:23.952 --> 28:25.568
- That's the theory.
- A good one, though.

28:25.954 --> 28:29.743
If Cayden had audio and video
on all of us, especially Oliver,

28:29.833 --> 28:31.415
why would he just tee up Rene?

28:31.627 --> 28:33.869
It figures he'd go after
the most handsome and charming.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.422
Well, maybe when Oliver
finally takes down Cayden James,

28:37.507 --> 28:40.295
we'll figure out the details
of his master plan.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.460
Why assume we're gonna wait for
Oliver?

28:43.680 --> 28:44.921
What are we gonna do here?

28:45.015 --> 28:47.132
We're gonna sit around and wait
to see how this all plays out?

28:47.434 --> 28:49.221
Hope it plays out, you mean.

28:49.853 --> 28:51.264
You guys are serious about this?

28:51.563 --> 28:54.226
About taking on Cayden James
and his super posse?

28:54.316 --> 28:56.558
I let Vince walk once. I'm not
gonna make that mistake again.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.644
And I owe that son of a bitch
some serious payback.

28:59.905 --> 29:01.692
If I'm reading the room correctly,

29:01.782 --> 29:04.115
we're gonna form our own team, right?

29:05.994 --> 29:07.280
Right.

29:10.165 --> 29:11.201
Right.

29:12.542 --> 29:13.532
OLIVER: What's going on?

29:13.627 --> 29:15.084
Signal chatter
from Bertinelli's laptop.

29:15.170 --> 29:16.832
They're bringing in the Red Lions.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.288
Ah. The Red Lions.

29:18.382 --> 29:19.839
Chechnyan death squad.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.666
Bertinelli's not gonna
let the port go without a fight.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.342
Well, I'm thinking the enemy
of Cayden James

29:23.428 --> 29:25.044
is my favorite death squad.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.380
The Red Lions liberated a town
in Kizlyar last year.

29:27.474 --> 29:28.590
Turned it into a wasteland.

29:28.684 --> 29:30.300
We cannot let James's group
go up against these guys.

29:30.394 --> 29:32.181
The collateral damage
will destroy the port.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.061
Where are Bertinelli
and the Red Lions holed up?

29:34.147 --> 29:35.729
Storage facility on 5th and Brockton.

29:36.316 --> 29:37.852
(REWINDING)

29:37.943 --> 29:40.151
We can take the port
without Bertinelli's say,

29:40.237 --> 29:42.980
but there are
a lot of players in this city.

29:43.657 --> 29:46.400
I think you should set a precedent
for when you're in charge.

29:46.827 --> 29:49.911
I'm already in charge, Ms. Lance.

29:50.122 --> 29:53.115
Even more reason
to use his corpse as a message.

29:53.208 --> 29:54.619
I concur.

29:56.795 --> 30:00.880
Mr. Bertinelli has his army.
He should meet ours.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.634
- You think Bertinelli's gonna show?
- He better.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.343
He will.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.727
JERRY: Let's get this over with.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.604
If Keyhole satellite imagery
is anything to go off of,

30:20.694 --> 30:22.026
it looks like
Cayden James took the bait.

30:33.457 --> 30:34.447
Whoa!

30:37.878 --> 30:38.868
Go, go!

30:39.588 --> 30:40.704
Funny thing.

30:40.881 --> 30:43.840
You guys don't look like
a Chechnyan death squad!

30:52.809 --> 30:53.890

31:05.572 --> 31:07.484

31:57.791 --> 31:59.123
Oliver, get out of there.

32:01.586 --> 32:02.747
Send in the cavalry.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.800
So, how does this compare to <i>Halo?</i>

32:13.890 --> 32:16.257

I'm disappointed, Mr. Bertinelli.
I truly am.

33:18.914 --> 33:20.371
But not unreasonable.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.203
This can go one of two ways
for you and your men.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.330
The choice is yours.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.634
Forgive me, kid.

33:57.619 --> 34:00.612
It's fine. Relax, all right?
Just take the freaking port.

34:00.956 --> 34:02.117
Thank you.

34:03.250 --> 34:06.743
Although you elected
to betray me this evening,

34:07.295 --> 34:09.378
you ultimately made the right choice.

34:11.507 --> 34:12.498

34:18.056 --> 34:20.719
Which is why
I won't have your daughter killed.

34:20.976 --> 34:24.185
I expect you can find the most
effective use for this corpse

34:24.271 --> 34:25.762
to... How did you put it?

34:26.438 --> 34:28.021
"Send a message."

34:34.030 --> 34:35.440
Aren't you happy to be back

34:35.532 --> 34:38.650
in your newly debugged
crime-fighting lair?

34:38.743 --> 34:40.029
Cayden James got away.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.742
Everybody got away. (CLEARS THROAT)

34:43.998 --> 34:45.284
Did you ever see that movie

34:45.375 --> 34:46.536
<i>- BullDurham?</i>
- Hmm?

34:46.626 --> 34:48.743
My mom made me watch that movie
all the time.

34:48.837 --> 34:50.623
I mean, it is the best
baseball movie ever,

34:50.714 --> 34:51.920
but she used to say

34:52.007 --> 34:54.248
that Susan Sarandon
was her fictional life coach.

34:55.552 --> 35:00.468
There's a line in this movie
where she says,

35:00.557 --> 35:03.641
"Sometimes you win,
sometimes you lose,

35:04.769 --> 35:06.510
"and sometimes it rains."

35:07.439 --> 35:08.646
You can't control the weather.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.564
You couldn't control
Bertinelli betraying you.

35:10.650 --> 35:12.266
You know what else I can't control?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.186
Their numbers advantage.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.155
I can't be out there solo
against that group.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.321
It's not the smart move.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.736
I won't make that mistake again.

35:26.916 --> 35:29.124
I just want to say that, I, for one,

35:29.336 --> 35:32.750
think it's great that we're all
back in the same room together.

35:32.839 --> 35:34.671
Trust and forgiveness.

35:36.092 --> 35:39.506
For the past few weeks,
I have been really struggling

35:39.596 --> 35:40.803
to square that circle.

35:40.889 --> 35:43.757
I think all of us have.

35:44.517 --> 35:48.056
Rene, as a father, I understand
why you did what you did.

35:48.813 --> 35:53.979
I also recognize that you might be
taking me away from my son.

35:55.987 --> 36:00.027
I reacted to that and I got angry.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.029
The three of us decided

36:03.119 --> 36:04.860
to put the three of you
under surveillance.

36:05.747 --> 36:07.409
I take responsibility for that.

36:07.749 --> 36:09.365
It was, without question...

36:10.752 --> 36:11.959
It was a breach of trust.

36:14.297 --> 36:15.879
So was lying to the team about Vince.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.581
And I'm not trying
to point fingers, Dinah,

36:17.676 --> 36:19.713
I am simply trying to illustrate

36:19.803 --> 36:23.763
that there is blame
on all sides here.

36:24.265 --> 36:28.100
But we don't have time for grudges
or recriminations. We don't.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.018
Not with what the city is up against.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.896
So? What do you guys think?

36:34.484 --> 36:35.645
Clean slate?

36:38.905 --> 36:39.986
Clean slate.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.317
Things just go back
to the way they were before?

36:46.413 --> 36:47.529
Yeah.

36:48.164 --> 36:49.450
I don't think I can do that.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.578
Not after what the three of you did.

36:53.086 --> 36:54.577
This city needs us.

36:55.296 --> 36:59.085
And we know that, and we're not
shirking that responsibility.

37:00.969 --> 37:02.631
We decided to go our own way.

37:03.096 --> 37:04.678
- Wait a minute.
- No, no. Let's...

37:04.764 --> 37:06.096
No, no, no.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.220
This is what Cayden James wants.

37:08.309 --> 37:11.017
Cayden didn't do this, Felicity.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.222
He didn't create
an environment of distrust.

37:14.607 --> 37:16.849
A team where
some members of that team

37:16.943 --> 37:19.026
were treated differently than others.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.865
Cayden James didn't demand allegiance

37:25.034 --> 37:26.866
and then play
by his own set of rules.

37:27.287 --> 37:31.156
I came because I want
to be a part of a real team.

37:31.499 --> 37:32.910
Point taken.

37:34.335 --> 37:35.917
I'd like to
wish the three of you good luck.

37:36.463 --> 37:38.830
And I mean that sincerely
with Cayden,

37:38.923 --> 37:43.167
with Anatoly, Diaz,
Black Siren, Vigilante,

37:43.261 --> 37:44.877
these people are dangerous.

37:46.598 --> 37:49.056
So, whatever you have planned,
whatever your move is,

37:52.061 --> 37:53.347
good luck.

37:54.063 --> 37:55.304
Let's go, guys.

37:57.192 --> 37:58.433
(SIGHS)

38:01.154 --> 38:04.363
I may have solved
the glitch in my chip.

38:06.534 --> 38:07.650
I hope it helps.

38:10.872 --> 38:13.239
I, um, really do.

38:18.004 --> 38:19.290
(DOOR CLOSES)

38:35.855 --> 38:37.096
What the...

38:39.818 --> 38:40.899
I hope you don't mind.

38:41.903 --> 38:43.860
Found these in my personal collection

38:43.947 --> 38:46.360
and thought that we could add them
to your album.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.027
Oh, thank you very much.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.443
- It's my apology.
- For what?

38:51.538 --> 38:52.528
You were right.

38:52.622 --> 38:56.832
Look, Malcolm was every bit
as bad as this Laurel is right now,

38:56.918 --> 39:02.710
and then in the end, he wasn't.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.294
He changed.

39:06.636 --> 39:08.047
And Laurel can, too.

39:08.763 --> 39:10.880
I had no right
to tell you that she couldn't.

39:13.226 --> 39:14.467
Right.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.387
How the hell am I gonna do that?

39:18.648 --> 39:20.014
Well, I can help.

39:21.192 --> 39:24.776
And... I don't know. Maybe together,

39:26.281 --> 39:28.147
we can find a way
to break through to her.

39:28.491 --> 39:29.902
Yeah.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.533
When you said
you had something to show us,

39:34.622 --> 39:36.739
didn't you think
lights would be useful?

39:36.833 --> 39:38.244
One second, guys.

39:38.334 --> 39:41.077
It is all about the reveal.

39:48.219 --> 39:49.551
What does it look like?

39:49.637 --> 39:51.048
Some place.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.096
No, it's our new lair. (CHUCKLES)

39:53.182 --> 39:54.969
Helix used to operate out of here,

39:55.059 --> 39:57.346
but it's not like
they're using it anymore, so.

39:57.437 --> 39:59.599
Curtis, it's genius.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.265
Seriously, nice work.

40:02.358 --> 40:03.849
I'm glad you guys like it.

40:03.943 --> 40:06.481
Now, I don't suggest
we make this a regular thing,

40:06.571 --> 40:07.982
seeing as how
I'm a lightweight and all,

40:08.072 --> 40:12.407
but this event warrants celebration.

40:12.493 --> 40:16.828
Well, I am just glad that
I've found partners who I can trust.

40:16.915 --> 40:18.281
That's what I'm talking about.

40:30.303 --> 40:31.544
I'm concerned.

40:33.473 --> 40:35.465
And the feeling doesn't suit me well.

40:35.558 --> 40:38.926
You got the port like you wanted.

40:39.020 --> 40:42.138
Sorry if I was unclear.
My concern relates to you.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.604
Your continued association
with Ms. Drake wouldn't worry me

40:47.195 --> 40:54.034
if this surveillance didn't suggest
that she knows about our association.

40:54.494 --> 40:55.780
Don't worry.

40:56.245 --> 40:57.736
I can handle Dinah.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.454
There's not a button she has
I don't know how to push.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.330
FELICITY: All right.

41:08.675 --> 41:10.257
The new chip is in.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.922
Just one second.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.261
(SIGHING)

41:23.231 --> 41:24.472
It doesn't feel any different.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.060
It takes a minute.

41:31.239 --> 41:32.355
(GASPS)

41:32.949 --> 41:33.939
Or not.

41:34.784 --> 41:35.900
It worked?

41:43.251 --> 41:45.117
Looks like we're not
as undermanned as we thought.

41:45.211 --> 41:46.418
Yes.

42:13.072 --> 42:14.062
