CHRIS ROCK:
When I was a kid, Thanksgiving
was my favorite holiday.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.782
All you had to do was eat...

00:14.815 --> 00:18.619
Chris, pass the
macaroni and cheese.

00:18.652 --> 00:19.653
...and sleep.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.190
Everybody in my family
loved Thanksgiving,

00:22.223 --> 00:23.657
except my mother,

00:23.691 --> 00:26.094
because to her
it was just more work.

00:27.361 --> 00:30.064
But this year was going
to be different.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.599
All right, guys,
family conference.

00:31.632 --> 00:32.833
I just want to
let y'all know

00:32.866 --> 00:35.469
that if you think all you're
going to do this Thanksgiving

00:35.503 --> 00:37.105
is sit around and eat and sleep,

00:37.138 --> 00:38.172
you got another
think coming.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.440
Uncle Louis
is coming over

00:39.473 --> 00:42.076
and I'm not doing
all the work by myself.

00:42.110 --> 00:43.111
What do we have to do?

00:43.144 --> 00:44.478
I want everybody to make a dish.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.280
I'll make the rolls.

00:46.314 --> 00:48.082
I can make the cranberry sauce.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.751
Which means she can open up
a can and dump it in a bowl.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.087
Chris, I want you to make
the mac and cheese.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.256
I don't know how to make
mac and cheese.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.625
And I don't want to be
the one to mess it up.

00:57.658 --> 00:58.559
I like living here.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.661
Next to turkey,
the most important dish

01:00.694 --> 01:03.631
at our Thanksgiving dinner
was the macaroni and cheese.

01:03.664 --> 01:07.468
Making good mac and cheese
wasn't cooking, it was science.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.238
This year's Nobel prize
nominees are...

01:10.271 --> 01:12.473
Dr. Wan, for the cure
to cancer...

01:12.506 --> 01:15.643
Dr. Stravinsky, for the
discovery of the missing link...

01:15.676 --> 01:18.879
and Chris, for some
good-ass macaroni and cheese.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.114
And the winner is...

01:20.148 --> 01:21.215
Chris!

01:28.289 --> 01:29.890
That's okay, baby.
You'll do fine.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.260
All you got to do
is follow the recipe.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.895
Sounds to me like
a recipe for disaster.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.565

01:42.936 --> 01:45.339
* Oh... make it funky now!

02:08.296 --> 02:09.763
Rochelle...

02:10.831 --> 02:12.200
Where've you been?

02:12.233 --> 02:13.301
At the grocery store.

02:13.334 --> 02:14.468
Oh.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.170
Foxy Brown sugar...

02:16.204 --> 02:19.307
Telly Savalas eggs...

02:19.340 --> 02:21.342
Dr. J stuffing...

02:21.375 --> 02:22.176
Chuck Berry cranberry sauce?!

02:22.210 --> 02:24.378
And a Larry Bird turkey.

02:24.412 --> 02:26.347
That won't even fit
into our oven.

02:26.380 --> 02:29.217
These are name brands.
What's going on?

02:29.250 --> 02:30.718
Nothing. Why?

02:30.751 --> 02:33.287
Is this because
your brother's coming?

02:33.321 --> 02:35.756
My Uncle Louis was
a successful chiropractor.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.325
Since he was younger,

02:37.358 --> 02:39.693
my father always felt like
he had to outdo him.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.262
I'll have a beer.

02:41.295 --> 02:43.431
And you?
I'll have a red wine.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.266
I'll have a red wine, too.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.400
A large.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.836
Man, you wouldn't believe
the stress I'm under at work.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.371
I just got
15 new patients.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.973
Man, I got so much
stress at work,

02:53.006 --> 02:55.309
they had to hire another
guy to help me worry.

02:55.343 --> 02:58.246
I got her for
$150 below sticker.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.647
Really?
Yeah.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.482
Oh, wow.

03:01.515 --> 03:04.385
I got my whole car
for below $150.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.988
There's $98.47
worth of groceries.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.457
That's usually what he says.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.325
Rochelle, we have
family coming over.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.227
I can't have them thinking
we can't afford nice things.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.728
That's usually what she says.

03:14.762 --> 03:17.731
Baby, why do you feel like
you have to compete with Louis?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.400
This has nothing to do
with Louis.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.269
I just want to have
a good dinner.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.472
Class...

03:24.505 --> 03:27.941
I've decided to give you
a holiday homework assignment.

03:27.975 --> 03:29.310
Damn.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.512
Yes, Chris?
But it's a holiday.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.947
And a very special one, Chris.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.384
So for your assignment,

03:36.417 --> 03:39.320
I want you to talk
to family and friends,

03:39.353 --> 03:40.954
and then write an essay

03:40.988 --> 03:44.592
on what you're thankful for
this Thanksgiving.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.460
I used to be thankful
for no homework.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.302
Everybody, up, up, up, up, up!

03:54.335 --> 03:56.036
Get up!
What?
What happened?

03:56.069 --> 03:57.338
Time to cook.

03:57.371 --> 03:58.372
Do we have to do it now?

03:58.406 --> 03:59.473
Yeah, I'm tired.
Me, too.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.041
Only ten hours
'till turkey time.

04:01.074 --> 04:03.744
It's one second to what-the-
hell-is-wrong-with-you time.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.446
What the hell is wrong with you?

04:05.479 --> 04:06.480
Look, I need
everybody's help.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.482
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna do this right.

04:08.516 --> 04:11.419
Because my father really wanted
to impress his brother,

04:11.452 --> 04:14.388
my dad was cooking like
a quarterback running plays.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.757
Okay, Chris, while the macaroni
is boiling on the front burner

04:16.790 --> 04:18.726
and you're grating the cheese
on the chopping board,

04:18.759 --> 04:22.363
Tonya, I need you to break right
into the dining room

04:22.396 --> 04:23.597
and prep the cranberry sauce.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.065
Now while the sauce is jiggling,

04:25.098 --> 04:28.035
Tonya and Drew, I need you
to cover setting the table,

04:28.068 --> 04:30.804
while I scrimmage to prepare
the rest of the meal.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.040
Now, Drew, I need you
to cut across

04:33.073 --> 04:35.343
back into the kitchen,
bake the rolls,

04:35.376 --> 04:37.778
and get them back to the table
in 15 minutes.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.313
On three.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.814
One, two, three...

04:40.848 --> 04:41.949
Grease!

04:43.351 --> 04:45.052
What?

04:45.085 --> 04:46.354
Nothing.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.356
Looks like you got it
all handled.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.491
I think I'm gonna go upstairs.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.060
But I need your help.
No...

04:53.093 --> 04:54.828
because if something goes wrong,

04:54.862 --> 04:56.664
I don't want you blaming me.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.466
He's blaming her right now.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.606
While we got ready
for Thanksgiving,

05:05.639 --> 05:08.108
Mr. Omar came by
for thanks-taking.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.410
Hi, Ms. Rochelle.

05:09.443 --> 05:10.844
Can I could borrow
a cup of flour?

05:10.878 --> 05:12.780
Oh, sure, no problem.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.517
Can I borrow
a cup of gravy?

05:20.921 --> 05:22.390
Can I borrow a cup?

05:22.423 --> 05:24.458
Mr. Omar, why don't you
just come over

05:24.492 --> 05:25.393
for Thanksgiving dinner?

05:25.426 --> 05:27.595
I thought you'd never ask.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.929
See you later.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.364
Meanwhile, my Dad
was still cooking like

05:30.398 --> 05:31.632
a quarterback running plays.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.467
Hey, Chris, no, no, no.
Long, smooth strokes.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.468
Don't beat it.

05:34.502 --> 05:35.636
Did you butter the tops?

05:35.669 --> 05:38.706
No.
Well, then it's not ready
to go in the oven yet.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.708
Here, put the
butter on, gently.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.411
No, no, no, put that
in a glass bowl.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.546
But last year, we used
the plastic bowl.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.847
Last year, my brother
wasn't coming.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.881
What's the difference?

05:47.915 --> 05:48.882
The difference is,

05:48.916 --> 05:50.551
last year my brother
wasn't coming.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.686
Now put that in
a glass bowl. Please?

05:54.154 --> 05:55.723
Dad, what are you
doing to that turkey?

05:55.756 --> 05:59.059
That turkey's about to ask
for a happy ending.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.695
My mother always said
if you massage the turkey,

06:01.729 --> 06:03.163
then the meat
will be more tender.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.499
Don't put too much
pepper on that.

06:05.533 --> 06:06.634
Got it.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.969
Hey, Dad, can we
take a break?

06:09.002 --> 06:10.604
Did Martin Luther King, Jr.
take a break?

06:10.638 --> 06:11.939
Did Moses
take a break?

06:11.972 --> 06:13.574
Did Gandhi take a break?

06:13.607 --> 06:15.175
He took a break from eating.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.811
That looks pretty good, Chris.
Thanks, Dad.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.947
Remember, two hours.
I got to put the turkey in next.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.683
My mac and cheese
looked so good

06:22.716 --> 06:24.885
Gandhi would've
snuck himself a plate.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.122
While my father
was in the kitchen,

06:29.156 --> 06:30.591
my mother had
something cooking.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.826
Yeah, come on
over, Vanessa.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.862
Uh-huh, Julius
is cooking.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.465
His mother's
recipes, child.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.500
No, it's always
room for one more.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.535
Okay, see you later.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.071
What are you doing?

06:44.104 --> 06:46.507
Well, you always invite people
over when I cook,

06:46.540 --> 06:48.509
so I figured I'll invite
a few people over

06:48.542 --> 06:49.577
since you're cooking.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.778
Fine.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.546
I'm going to take a quick nap.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.582
Can you wake me up,
so I can put the turkey in

06:54.615 --> 06:55.816
when Chris takes
the macaroni out?

06:55.849 --> 06:57.017
All right, baby.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.118
Thank you, babe.

06:58.151 --> 06:59.553
Since we got up so early,

06:59.587 --> 07:01.689
it was the first
Thanksgiving in history

07:01.722 --> 07:04.057
where people took a nap
before the turkey.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.735
Of course she didn't
fall asleep on purpose,

07:14.768 --> 07:16.904
but that didn't matter
to the oven.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.610
Oh, no.

07:23.677 --> 07:24.945
Oh, no!

07:26.013 --> 07:27.615
No!

07:28.749 --> 07:30.618
That's not macaroni and cheese,

07:30.651 --> 07:32.520
that's blackaroni and cheese.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.632
That mac and cheese looked
how my father felt.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.168
That's your mother's recipe?

07:48.201 --> 07:49.202
How come you didn't wake me up?

07:49.236 --> 07:51.639
Because you woke me up
at 5:00 in the morning.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.042
What are you going to do
about this mac and cheese?

07:55.075 --> 07:57.511
I sent Chris down to
Doc's to get some more.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.947
You sent Chris to look
for macaroni and cheese

07:59.980 --> 08:01.582
on Thanksgiving?

08:01.615 --> 08:03.551
That's like trying to find
candles on Hanukkah.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.618
Well, don't worry about it.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.588
Look, I'll start the turkey
and finish the cobbler.

08:07.621 --> 08:09.857
Well, where are you going
to cook the mac and cheese?

08:09.890 --> 08:10.891
In the oven.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.593
When?
What are you
talking about?

08:12.626 --> 08:15.028
The turkey's gonna take
five hours at 300 degrees,

08:15.062 --> 08:16.697
the mac and cheese
is gonna take

08:16.730 --> 08:18.766
two hours
at 320 degrees,

08:18.799 --> 08:22.670
then the cobbler's gonna take
45 minutes at 425 degrees.

08:22.703 --> 08:23.904
You've already
lost two hours

08:23.937 --> 08:25.639
with Three Mile Island
here, so I'd say

08:25.673 --> 08:27.908
we'll probably, we'll be
eating dinner around about

08:27.941 --> 08:29.309
1:30 tomorrow morning.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.579
That's if nothing else
goes wrong.

08:31.612 --> 08:34.181
My mother was bad at math,
except when it came to

08:34.214 --> 08:36.617
multiplying
my father's headaches.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.890
Happy Thanksgiving!

08:44.625 --> 08:45.593
Hey, big bro.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.127
What's up, Louis.
How you doing?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.596
Hi, Vanessa.

08:48.629 --> 08:49.730
How are you,
Mr. Julius?

08:49.763 --> 08:50.998
You know
Mrs. Watkins.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.633
Not like you do.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.001
Big man!

08:54.034 --> 08:55.002
Hey.
All right.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.737
Hey, go on in,
go on in.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.707
Louis.
Hey, man.

08:59.740 --> 09:00.608
How you doing?

09:00.641 --> 09:02.643
So, I didn't want
to show up empty-handed.

09:02.676 --> 09:03.811
So voilá.
Thank you.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.912
What is it?

09:04.945 --> 09:06.614
It smells delicious.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.815
Uh-oh, watch her.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.249
Ever since
her husband died,

09:09.282 --> 09:11.218
she's been eating like
it's going out of style.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.255
They're organic
green beans.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.290
See, I toasted some almonds up

09:17.324 --> 09:18.425
and then I crushed them

09:18.458 --> 09:21.662
and drizzled on some olive oil
that I pressed myself.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.363
You sound like you
went to chef school.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.899
No, I'm a chiropractor.
He went to spine school.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.601
You didn't tell me your
brother went to college.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.036
You didn't tell me
you had a brother.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.704
Hey, Uncle Louis!

09:30.738 --> 09:31.772
What's up, sweetie?

09:31.805 --> 09:33.073
Hey, big man.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.775
Hey.
Hey.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.744
Good seeing you.
Hey!

09:36.777 --> 09:37.945
Why they don't
treat me like that?

09:37.978 --> 09:39.279
'Cause you don't have a job.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.648
Hey, where's Chris?

09:40.681 --> 09:41.715
Oh, he went out,
he'll be back.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.016
Oh, okay.
Well, um,

09:43.050 --> 09:44.618
everybody put your coats down

09:44.652 --> 09:46.019
and, you know,
we'll get started.

09:46.053 --> 09:47.755
You're looking
for macaroni

09:47.788 --> 09:49.757
on Thanksgiving Day?

09:49.790 --> 09:52.760
Man, that's like looking
for candles on Hanukkah.

09:52.793 --> 09:55.729
Well, I did make the mac
and cheese, but I burned it.

09:55.763 --> 09:58.699
You don't have to worry.
I know just what to do.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.901
You don't need
macaroni and cheese

10:00.934 --> 10:02.770
to make macaroni and cheese.

10:02.803 --> 10:03.771
You don't?

10:03.804 --> 10:05.739
No.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.642
You can make macaroni and cheese
out of anything.

10:08.676 --> 10:09.777
All you got to do is...

10:09.810 --> 10:12.646
Whenever anyone says,
"All you have to do is..."

10:12.680 --> 10:15.849
the next thing they say
is always something impossible.

10:15.883 --> 10:17.785
Dismantling a bomb
is easy.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.987
All you have to do
is identify the ground wire,

10:20.020 --> 10:21.421
pull out your cutters...

10:21.454 --> 10:23.323
and snip.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.061
You try it.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.000
Base jumping is easy.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.836
All you got to do is make sure
you have enough distance

10:35.869 --> 10:39.172
from the base before
you pop your chute.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.742
:
You try...

10:43.811 --> 10:46.747
Juggling chainsaws
is easy.

10:46.780 --> 10:50.718
All you have to do is keep one
saw in the air at all times.

10:52.920 --> 10:55.723
All you have to do is learn
to live with one hand.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.825
Dang, man, you want me to go
get somebody or something?

10:57.858 --> 11:01.729
Leave it in for 96 minutes
and that's it.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.697
Simple.

11:03.731 --> 11:04.932
Doc, I can't do all this.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.434
Why don't you just come by the
house and make it yourself?

11:07.467 --> 11:08.836
I mean, you can stay
for dinner.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.237
I'm working.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.005
But I really need
your help, Doc.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.777
Maybe I can close early.

11:19.512 --> 11:23.450
Back at home, while my father
was doing all the work,

11:23.483 --> 11:25.719
his brother was having
all the fun.

11:25.753 --> 11:26.920
Wherever he went,
my Uncle Louis

11:26.954 --> 11:28.255
was the life of the party.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.790
He danced...
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

11:34.461 --> 11:37.030
Don't get so excited.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.003
...he sang...

11:43.036 --> 11:45.138
* Solid...

11:45.172 --> 11:47.908
* I'm solid as a rock

11:49.943 --> 11:54.281
* And nothing's changed it

11:54.314 --> 11:58.285
* The thrill is still
hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot. *

11:58.318 --> 12:00.788
He even spun plates.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.762
But what he seemed
to do best,

12:08.796 --> 12:10.197
was irritate my father.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.233
* And now we're solid

12:13.266 --> 12:15.936
* We're solid as a...

12:15.969 --> 12:17.170
* Rock

12:17.204 --> 12:18.271
* Solid as a...

12:18.305 --> 12:20.941
Don't you see me trying to fit
this turkey in the oven?

12:20.974 --> 12:23.110
Oh, yeah, just
move the rack.

12:23.143 --> 12:24.211
Move the rack?

12:24.244 --> 12:26.346
* Just move the rack.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.783
I'm sorry, forgive me,
I didn't go to college.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.018
Where's that carving knife?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.086
Hey, hey, Julius man,
I'm just trying to help.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.454
You want to help me?
Yeah.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.556
Get back out there and start
singing and dancing again.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.025
That's how you
can help me.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.559
What is your problem, man?

12:39.592 --> 12:40.828
I'm sick of you,
that's my problem.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.229
Ever since you
come over here,

12:42.262 --> 12:45.165
you been trying
to make me look bad.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.099
I go out of my way
to make a dinner for you,

12:46.133 --> 12:47.234
and you out there doing
Ashford and Simpson.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.836
I bought all
these groceries

12:48.869 --> 12:50.170
and even used Mom's recipes.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.172
Whoa, who told you
to use Mom's recipes?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.306
You know Mama can't cook.

12:53.340 --> 12:55.175
I didn't tell you
to do any of this.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.544
All I said was
that I'm coming over.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.212
And you're the one
running around here

12:59.246 --> 13:01.148
looking like
the Galloping Gourmet.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.316
Forget it. I'm done.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.285
You can't stop cook...

13:05.318 --> 13:06.453
You got people here, man.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.588
They like you so much...

13:08.621 --> 13:11.892
let's see how they
like your cooking.

13:11.925 --> 13:14.494
Happy Thanksgiving.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.173
Hi, Uncle Louis.
Hey, Mr. Chris.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.240
How you doing, man?

13:27.274 --> 13:28.408
Good.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.310
Well, who died?

13:30.343 --> 13:31.879
My husband.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.481
Oh, my condolences.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.416
No, not just now.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.518
It happened a couple
of weeks ago.

13:38.551 --> 13:41.154
Yeah, he got mauled by
a bear at the circus.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.891
Tragic.

13:43.924 --> 13:44.992
So you're a widow?

13:45.025 --> 13:46.326
Yes.
All right, now.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.495
It's her third time.
You gonna be number four?

13:48.528 --> 13:50.163
You better leave
her alone.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.331
So where you been, Chris?

13:51.364 --> 13:53.233
Oh, I been with Doc.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.268
He's going to make his
famous macaroni and cheese.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.270
LOUIS:
Oh, that's what
I'm talking about.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.339
Good.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.974
Cook it fast. I'm hungry.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.051
I'm sorry.

14:11.084 --> 14:14.087
I didn't know it was
that important to you.

14:14.121 --> 14:16.456
It's... it's all right.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.225
Baby.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.427
What?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.229
I think you broke
the turkey.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.275
If I didn't do something,

14:35.308 --> 14:40.147
this was going to be the most
depressing Thanksgiving ever.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.282
So...

14:42.315 --> 14:46.619
Uncle Mike, is your back
still hurting?

14:46.653 --> 14:49.022
Oh, yeah. My back as been out
for 11 years.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.258
It's an old football injury.

14:51.291 --> 14:52.459
I didn't know
you played football.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.395
I don't. I was
watching football

14:55.428 --> 14:56.263
and fell off the couch.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.497
Does your back hurt now?

14:57.530 --> 14:59.967
Yeah.
Show me where.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.302
Right here.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.403
Right back there.

15:03.436 --> 15:05.572
Yeah, right, right,
right there.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.040
That's your L-5.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.541
I can fix that for you.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.444
I don't know. I've been
knowing a lot of doctors

15:11.478 --> 15:13.380
and they told me
it was all chronic.

15:13.413 --> 15:17.017
Chronic? What doctor has he
been going to

15:17.050 --> 15:19.386
Doctors-- they don't know
what they're talking about.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.955
All right, here, here.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.090
Ready?

15:24.257 --> 15:25.225
Oh, geez.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.560
I feel better.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.030
Oh, good. Now you
can get a job.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.598
I'm not cured, Rochelle.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.300
It's just in remission.

15:34.701 --> 15:36.436
I'm next.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.072
Cross your arms.

15:39.106 --> 15:41.608
Okay, I'll get this
out of here.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.443
They look happy now,

15:43.476 --> 15:45.678
but wait till he sends
them the bill.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.152
Oh.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.221
Oh, right here.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.623
While everyone was inside
feeling better,

15:56.656 --> 16:00.227
my father was outside
feeling worse.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.329
Whoa, whoa, don't throw
that away.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.631
Is that burnt mac and cheese?

16:04.664 --> 16:05.632
Yeah. Why?

16:05.665 --> 16:08.201
It's just the way
I like it.

16:08.235 --> 16:09.302
He wants that blackaroni,

16:09.336 --> 16:12.039
'cause he's on that crackaroni.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.643
Hey.

16:16.676 --> 16:18.011
Hey.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.446
You all right?

16:19.479 --> 16:22.349
Yeah. You?

16:22.382 --> 16:24.051
Me? Yeah.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.452
All right.
All right.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.221
All right.
All right.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.324
Hungry?

16:31.358 --> 16:33.793
Yeah.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.395
Eat?

16:35.428 --> 16:37.497
Yeah.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.565
Cool.

16:38.598 --> 16:39.799
Cool.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.102
My father and uncle
loved each other,

16:42.135 --> 16:43.436
And even though
they didn't

16:43.470 --> 16:45.672
always get along,
deep down inside

16:45.705 --> 16:47.340
here's what
they really wanted to say.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.276
Hey. You all right?
Hey. Yeah.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.343
You?
Yeah.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.411
All right.
Hungry?

16:51.444 --> 16:52.545
Eat?
Yeah.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.680
Cool.
Cool.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.183
We couldn't wait
for the turkey,

16:56.216 --> 16:58.285
so Doc's mac and cheese
moved from side dish

16:58.318 --> 16:59.719
to main course.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.389
Rolls, mac and cheese,
cranberry sauce.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.623
You know, I haven't had

17:03.656 --> 17:05.392
a meal like this since
I kicked my habit.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.395
Yeah, I'm glad I don't have to
watch you at the store no more.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.331
I know that's right.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.734
You know what, this is the best
Thanksgiving I've had in years.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.736
VANESSA:
Not to mention the fact
you fixed my back.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.072
And these green
beans, they good.
Thank you.

17:19.106 --> 17:22.542
Ooh, Doc, this macaroni
and cheese is fantastic.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.077
It's the best
I've ever tasted.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.512
The best you'll ever taste,

17:25.545 --> 17:27.547
unless you invite me
to next Thanksgiving.

17:27.580 --> 17:31.451
Hey, Rochelle, why I got to be
over where with the kids?

17:31.484 --> 17:34.521
'Cause everybody at that table
lives with their mother.
Anyway...

17:34.554 --> 17:37.124
JULIUS:
'Cause only working people
at this table.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.331
Oh, well, since you're all here,

17:44.364 --> 17:45.565
I was wondering
if you could help me

17:45.598 --> 17:46.566
with my homework assignment.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.101
What do you need, baby?

17:48.135 --> 17:49.702
I need to find out what
everybody's

17:49.736 --> 17:51.504
really thankful for
this Thanksgiving.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.341
Well, I'm thankful I
didn't have to eat

17:54.374 --> 17:55.742
any of your burnt
mac and cheese.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.246
I'm thankful for Carla,
Leslie, Pam, Christie,

17:59.279 --> 18:02.582
Michelle, Tanisha,
and Miss Patterson.

18:02.615 --> 18:07.220
I'm thankful for Mrs. Tyler,
Mrs. Jackson, Mrs. Watkins,

18:07.254 --> 18:10.723
Mrs. Turner, Mrs. Perkins
And Mrs. Patterson.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.626
Well, I'm thankful that I don't
have to take no mess,

18:13.660 --> 18:15.862
'cause my man has two jobs.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.431
I'm thankful my son
has a job.

18:18.465 --> 18:21.501
:
I'm, uh... I'm thankful for
the world's greatest

18:21.534 --> 18:22.769
older brother, man,
and I mean that.

18:22.802 --> 18:24.171
Hey, big round of applause

18:24.204 --> 18:25.605
for the man who made
Thanksgiving possible,

18:25.638 --> 18:26.806
ladies and gentlemen.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.676
I'm thankful I don't have
to sit with those kids no more.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.312
I'm thankful I read
this book by Larry X.

18:32.345 --> 18:35.515
I mean, this brother
is so hip.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.884
He breaks down the real deal
on Thanksgiving

18:37.917 --> 18:39.452
as it pertains to the
disenfranchised

18:39.486 --> 18:42.622
minorities of this
capitalist society.

18:42.655 --> 18:43.790
And it's
autographed, too.

18:43.823 --> 18:46.493
You better read it.

18:46.526 --> 18:47.827
Thanks.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.696
While Doc had given me
some food for thought,

18:49.729 --> 18:52.299
my father couldn't take
his thoughts off of food.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.333
Come on, get up.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.635
Tonya, wake up.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.438
Chris, Chris, wake up.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.308
Drew, Drew, get up.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.480
Oh, Julius.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.250
It's beautiful.

19:10.283 --> 19:11.818
You didn't think he was going
to waste

19:11.851 --> 19:13.853
$95 worth of brand name food.

19:13.886 --> 19:17.690
* Girl, you're smiling
like a baby *

19:17.724 --> 19:23.763
* I ain't had nothing
like your love *

19:23.796 --> 19:27.700
* You're the one that I've been
thinking of... *

19:27.734 --> 19:29.536
Even though
I didn't like the idea

19:29.569 --> 19:30.937
of homework over Thanksgiving,

19:30.970 --> 19:34.807
I did learn what Thanksgiving
was all about.

19:34.841 --> 19:38.511
"To me, Thanksgiving means
family and togetherness.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.812
"Thanksgiving came about

19:39.846 --> 19:41.914
"when the Pilgrims
landed on Plymouth Rock.

19:41.948 --> 19:45.218
"The Indians greeted them,
provided them shelter,

19:45.252 --> 19:46.486
"taught them how to grow corn

19:46.519 --> 19:47.820
"and how to prepare
for the winter.

19:47.854 --> 19:48.888
"They went on to cook

19:48.921 --> 19:50.890
"one of the greatest meals
the pilgrims every ate.

19:50.923 --> 19:54.561
"And in appreciation
for showing them how

19:54.594 --> 19:57.664
"to prosper and survive
in this brave new world,

19:57.697 --> 19:59.499
"the pilgrims killed
the Indians

19:59.532 --> 20:01.401
"and created a holiday
in their honor.

20:01.434 --> 20:04.437
"So on this
Thanksgiving,

20:04.471 --> 20:06.773
"I'm thankful for
my family, my friends,

20:06.806 --> 20:08.608
"but most importantly,
I'm thankful

20:08.641 --> 20:10.710
that I'm not a Native American."

20:19.586 --> 20:21.588
Happy Thanksgiving.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.855
* Everybody hates Chris.
