WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:03.462
<i>Jeff, we just got this in.
Do we have time to run this?</i>

00:03.462 --> 00:05.506
- <i>Stand by, camera one.</i>
- <i>In four, three, two...</i>

00:05.506 --> 00:07.424
<i>- Yeah, got it.</i>
- <i>All right, let's go then.</i>

00:09.718 --> 00:11.553
Hello, and welcome to <i>Soccer Saturday.</i>

00:11.553 --> 00:14.181
I'm Jeff Stelling,
here with George Cartrick

00:14.181 --> 00:15.265
and Clinton Morrison.

00:15.933 --> 00:18.769
Now, the hottest team in the country
is clearly Richmond

00:18.769 --> 00:25.275
on a ten-game winning streak on the back
of some inspired play by Sam Obisanya.

00:25.275 --> 00:29.488
Jeff, you have to think Sam Obisanya
will make his Nigeria debut,

00:29.488 --> 00:31.156
or the world's gone truly mad.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.617
But our top story:

00:33.617 --> 00:36.954
the mysterious managerial vacancy
at West Ham United.

00:36.954 --> 00:41.375
The club has suddenly parted ways
with the Wonder Kid, Nathan Shelley.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.669
It's a shocker, Jeff.
They were having a great season.

00:43.669 --> 00:47.714
Yeah, but look, Nate Shelley isn't
the reason West Ham are in second place.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.634
I mean, "Wonder Kid"? Come on.

00:50.634 --> 00:53.303
He was my kit man, for God's sake.

00:53.303 --> 00:56.640
No, Rupert Mannion is the brains
behind this whole operation.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.811
Okay. Let's turn our attention
to the international break.

01:00.811 --> 01:03.146
National squad announcements
are trickling in.

01:03.146 --> 01:06.525
Which players will get the honor
of representing their country?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.947
All right, fellas,
great play out there today.

01:11.947 --> 01:14.783
Congratulations on
yet another victorious outcome!

01:17.619 --> 01:18.620
That's right.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.039
Hey, quick reminder.

01:21.039 --> 01:23.667
Because of the break in our schedule
due to international play,

01:23.667 --> 01:26.003
there is no game next week, all right?

01:28.172 --> 01:30.299
All right.
Hey, look, kind of hurts my feelings

01:30.299 --> 01:33.051
y'all don't want to spend next weekend
with me, if I'm being honest.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.804
But I am the strong silent type,
so I ain't gonna let you know.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.682
But I'm also loud and weak,
because I, like all humans,

01:38.682 --> 01:40.309
contain multitudes. Am I right?

01:41.143 --> 01:42.436
Great speech.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.606
Anyhoo, we want to say good night
and good luck to the fellas on our squad

01:45.606 --> 01:48.358
that have been chosen to represent
their home country next week.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.943
Coach, who we talking about?

01:49.943 --> 01:54.364
Just up the way at Wembley,
making his debut for England, Jamie Tartt!

01:56.200 --> 01:57.034
Go!

02:01.163 --> 02:04.791
Taking the plane to Toronto
to play goal for Canada, Van Damme!

02:04.791 --> 02:06.210
He's got a plane ticket.

02:06.210 --> 02:10.005
Who will be going up against Mexico
and Dani Rojas!

02:14.510 --> 02:15.511
Oh, boy.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.388
Bumbercatch holding it down
for Switzerland.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.390
My guy!

02:20.974 --> 02:23.852
- Wait, hold on. Bumbercatch, you're Swiss?
- Yeah. Look at me.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.395
No, you're right. Yeah. All right.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.149
- And repping Wales, Colin Hughes!
- Hey, there he is.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.193
Let's go, boyo.

02:34.905 --> 02:35.906
Is that it?

02:36.657 --> 02:37.658
And that's it.

02:42.496 --> 02:46.500
Okay. All right, well, let's go ahead
and wish our friends safe travels

02:46.500 --> 02:47.835
and Godspeed,

02:47.835 --> 02:51.255
or whatever narcotic your deity
chooses to self-medicate with.

02:51.255 --> 02:53.131
Rest of y'all, see ya on Monday.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.270
Oi, 24.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.813
They fucked you, man. I'm sorry.

03:08.772 --> 03:09.606
It's okay.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.525
Hey, congrats to you though.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.362
Listen. You good, yeah?

03:15.362 --> 03:16.822
Yeah. Of course.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.707
Hey, yo. Congrats, bro.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.253
I am not your bro.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.841
We are now enemies,
and soon, you will be my bitch.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.309
What the f--

04:07.456 --> 04:09.625
So you're telling me it only shows up
once a month?

04:10.876 --> 04:13.170
- And it never skips a month?
- Only if you're pregnant.

04:14.046 --> 04:16.507
Well, shoot. I got to check out
this wine delivery service.

04:16.507 --> 04:18.132
Sounds like a real corker. Yes.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.052
Did you hear about Nathan?

04:20.052 --> 04:22.179
- I did.
- What do we think happened there?

04:22.804 --> 04:26.225
Well, boss, I'm like an incomplete list
of Madeline Kahn's best films:

04:26.225 --> 04:27.309
I ain't got no clue.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.978
And it ain't really
none of my business anyhow.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.981
Ted, look,
I mean this in the nicest way possible,

04:33.565 --> 04:35.234
but you suck at girl talk.

04:35.234 --> 04:37.027
I know. I just don't like gossip.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.989
It's not gossip, Ted. It's speculation.

04:41.490 --> 04:44.493
I've actually been hearing rumblings
of inappropriate workplace behavior

04:44.493 --> 04:47.496
- over at West Ham.
- See? Excellent girl talk.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.458
So, chaps, what do we think?

04:52.376 --> 04:55.254
Is Nathan capable of being involved
in something like that?

04:56.463 --> 04:58.090
- No.
- Nah.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.758
- Good morning.
- Hello, Leslie.

04:59.758 --> 05:02.803
So, I heard some interesting scuttlebutt
last night.

05:03.554 --> 05:06.014
I don't like gossip,
but my butt don't mind a little scuttle.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.474
Go on, Leslie.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.810
Edwin Akufo's back in town.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.311
What now?

05:11.311 --> 05:12.646
Apparently, he's sniffing around

05:12.646 --> 05:15.732
about trying to create
a Super League of some sort.

05:15.732 --> 05:16.942
Where did you hear this?

05:16.942 --> 05:19.611
Well, Rebecca,
I am the director of Football Operations.

05:20.612 --> 05:23.532
And a bunch of us DFOs
have a little jazz jam band

05:23.532 --> 05:26.743
we call "The Directors of Beboperations."

05:27.452 --> 05:29.079
Akufo came up at rehearsal.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.957
This is not good.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.961
I'm sorry. Why is it so bad
that a billionaire wants to put together

05:35.961 --> 05:37.546
a bunch of superheroes to fight crime?

05:38.130 --> 05:39.965
Ted,
you're thinking of the Justice League.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.425
God, dang it. Yeah, I am.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.761
Super League is when
the world's biggest and wealthiest teams

05:44.761 --> 05:46.096
decide to compete against each other.

05:46.096 --> 05:49.766
So, not only would
David never get to face Goliath,

05:49.766 --> 05:52.811
the Davids could
cease to exist altogether.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.396
Wow.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.899
You know, I wouldn't be surprised
if Rupert was involved in this.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.612
Speak of the devil.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.498
- It was Rupert.
- Yes.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.834
Sorry. Okay. I thought it was
the actual devil for a second.

06:15.834 --> 06:16.919
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

06:28.639 --> 06:29.640
Are you alive?

06:30.224 --> 06:31.892
Unfortunately, yeah.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.145
You're okay.

06:38.524 --> 06:39.525
Am I an idiot?

06:39.525 --> 06:41.151
Sometimes, yes.

06:41.151 --> 06:44.905
No, I meant for quitting my job.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.825
Do you wish you hadn't?

06:51.495 --> 06:52.663
Then there's your answer.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.294
I just don't know what I'm gonna do.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.255
Do you need me to stay?

07:02.840 --> 07:06.009
No. No, that's-- No, I'm okay.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.680
Do you want to come to Poland with me?

07:10.681 --> 07:12.933
You can help me and my family
screw in light bulbs.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.978
- That's very funny.
- Why is it funny?

07:18.981 --> 07:20.732
I don't know. Sorry. I-- No.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.948
- I'll see you in a few days.
- Thank you.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.436
Can you tell us about Coach Shelley?

08:00.647 --> 08:02.149
Hey, Nate! Nate!

08:17.122 --> 08:18.123
- Hi.
- Sorry.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.333
- It's all right.
- Thanks.

08:21.793 --> 08:22.794
Shit.

08:32.554 --> 08:35.640
Keeley,
you are the nicest boss I've ever had.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.267
Thank you, Dan.

08:37.267 --> 08:40.102
And definitely the hottest.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.438
That's a complicated compliment.

08:43.774 --> 08:44.775
Thank you.

08:44.775 --> 08:45.859
Yeah.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.074
Barbara, what's going on?
Are we being slowly robbed?

08:53.617 --> 08:56.119
Wait. I'm sorry.
You haven't spoken with Jack?

08:56.119 --> 08:58.163
I haven't heard from Jack in weeks.

08:58.163 --> 09:03.377
But she emailed me last night to say that
she was gonna reach out and tell you.

09:03.377 --> 09:05.045
Tell me what, Barbara?

09:10.801 --> 09:14.555
The board of the VC
have decided to pull funding.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.767
They're shutting down KJPR.

09:20.978 --> 09:21.979
What?

09:23.772 --> 09:24.606
When?

09:24.606 --> 09:27.276
Oh, well, don't worry,
we've got plenty of time.

09:27.276 --> 09:30.320
- We don't have to be out till Friday.
- It's Wednesday.

09:31.363 --> 09:34.366
Yeah. I suppose that is quite soon,
isn't it?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.369
Especially if you didn't get
the email last night.

10:06.732 --> 10:10.402
I mean, if he doesn't want to coach
West Ham for millions, I'll bloody do it.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.406
What a wanker.

10:30.172 --> 10:32.925
Pineapple juice or apple juice?

10:38.180 --> 10:39.431
Hi.

10:41.475 --> 10:42.601
Hey, Dani!

10:45.020 --> 10:46.271
Dani, what's up, man?

10:47.606 --> 10:48.774
He's my teammate.

10:54.154 --> 10:57.074
Dani, you want some chips?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.896
Boy, oh, boy.

11:27.896 --> 11:31.191
Tell you what, Sam had himself a case
of the mean reds out there today, yeah?

11:31.191 --> 11:32.734
I don't fucking blame him.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.237
It's hard to see the ball
when your eyes are full of tears.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.031
Hey, Sam!

11:38.782 --> 11:40.993
Hey, look,
I know this week ain't been easy on ya.

11:40.993 --> 11:44.162
But don't forget,
even the great Michael Jordan himself

11:44.162 --> 11:46.164
didn't make his high school varsity
basketball team.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.332
- Yeah?
- Yes, Coach.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.878
But wasn't that because
he was only a 5'10" sophomore

11:50.878 --> 11:53.755
and the team was in need of height,
so they sent him to the junior varsity

11:53.755 --> 11:55.424
with the hope that
he would develop physically?

11:55.424 --> 11:57.843
Which he did,
growing 5 inches the very next summer.

11:58.552 --> 11:59.928
I mean, if you know all the details,

11:59.928 --> 12:01.847
it does render the story
a little less motivational,

12:01.847 --> 12:03.432
but my point still stands.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.017
Keep your head up. Be a goldfish.

12:05.017 --> 12:06.685
- All right?
- Okay.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.482
Boom!

12:13.108 --> 12:16.361
Tonight, me and Jane have reserved
an axe-throwing lane at Hatchet and Rye.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.697
You fellas care to join the festivities?

12:19.281 --> 12:22.284
That sounds equal parts fun
and dangerous. What are y'all celebrating?

12:22.284 --> 12:25.245
Karma's speedy delivery of a shit sandwich
to the Wonder Turd.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.039
Here, Jane made targets.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.963
Don't you feel it's bad karma
to celebrate someone else's bad karma?

12:34.963 --> 12:36.882
No. You in?

12:36.882 --> 12:40.177
I'd love to, but I've got a thing.

12:43.639 --> 12:44.806
Here we go.

12:44.806 --> 12:45.974
Hey, Janey baby!

12:46.475 --> 12:50.521
Yeah, we're all set. Could you remember
to bring my throwing axe, please?

12:50.521 --> 12:53.607
No, not that one.
The one with the leather sleeve.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.150
You know what? Just bring 'em all.

12:57.569 --> 12:58.570
Yeah, we are.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.988
Okay. Love you too.

13:02.449 --> 13:03.784
How many axes you got now?

13:03.784 --> 13:05.911
Seventeen.
But they're not all for throwing.

13:05.911 --> 13:08.580
Right. But they're all here in the UK?

13:08.580 --> 13:11.458
Oh, yeah. Couldn't imagine being
in a different country than my axes.

13:12.626 --> 13:14.336
She's gonna have trouble carrying that.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.720
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey.

13:25.597 --> 13:28.934
I'm so sorry about the national team.

13:30.018 --> 13:33.146
Well, you know.
I guess I could have worked harder.

13:34.398 --> 13:36.775
Well, I think you're wonderful.

13:38.694 --> 13:40.112
Thank you, Rebecca.

13:45.117 --> 13:46.326
- See you.
- Yeah.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.212
Hello, Rebecca.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.132
Where's the Hockney I gave you?

14:01.175 --> 14:03.927
Got rid of it. Sorry. W--
How did you get past security?

14:04.636 --> 14:05.846
My old mate, Renee.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.265
The creepy old man
that lives in the sewers?

14:08.265 --> 14:09.808
Oh, Rebecca, that's rude.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.852
He only works in the sewer.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.855
Right. Well, maybe next time
you could make an appointment.

14:17.191 --> 14:18.233
Of course.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.528
So, what do you want?

14:21.528 --> 14:25.115
To invite you to this meeting
for the Akufo League.

14:26.742 --> 14:27.743
Why?

14:27.743 --> 14:31.163
I've wanted to extend an olive branch.

14:31.163 --> 14:33.749
And I think it's important
that you're part of this.

14:35.250 --> 14:36.793
Could be great for the game.

14:37.669 --> 14:40.088
Well, I will give it some thought.

14:40.672 --> 14:41.882
Good.

14:42.466 --> 14:47.888
Sneaking in here today reminded me of
the first match I ever saw at Nelson Road.

14:48.472 --> 14:49.890
When they used to play by candlelight.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.228
I look forward to hearing from you.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.025
What happened with Nathan Shelley?

15:03.487 --> 15:06.031
Some people just aren't ready
when they get their shot.

15:16.834 --> 15:19.002
Happy Uncle Day!

15:21.338 --> 15:23.924
- You know it's not a real holiday, right?
- Yes, it is.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.300
Right, Mummy?

15:25.300 --> 15:28.136
Any day that annoys Roy, holiday for me.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.473
I'll get it.

15:33.559 --> 15:36.436
Phoe told me that Uncle's Day
is her favorite holiday of the year.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.855
- Fuck off.
- Yeah, seriously.

15:37.855 --> 15:42.109
It was Uncle's Day, Uncle Roy's birthday,
and then <i>Perchtenlaufen</i>,

15:42.109 --> 15:44.778
the German holiday
where people dress up as evil spirits

15:44.778 --> 15:48.657
and roam the streets
in order to scare winter away.

15:48.657 --> 15:52.119
She might be an old soul, but
she's a proper fucking dweeb, isn't she?

15:52.119 --> 15:53.620
Is that your Range Rover outside?

15:53.620 --> 15:56.081
- No, it's my mum's.
- Oh, right, all right.

15:56.081 --> 15:57.624
Hey, how you doing? You all right?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.877
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

15:59.877 --> 16:02.379
You can just sit down next to Uncle Roy.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.422
Hello, Uncle Roy.

16:03.422 --> 16:05.132
What the fuck is he doing here?

16:05.883 --> 16:07.718
I had to invite your best friend.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.595
- He's not my best friend.
- He isn't my best friend.

16:10.387 --> 16:15.559
Well, you talk about him a lot,
and you spend every day together.

16:15.559 --> 16:16.894
Well, he's not.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.521
So, who's your best friend, Jamie?

16:20.105 --> 16:20.939
Probably Isaac.

16:20.939 --> 16:23.108
- Fuck off.
- He is.

16:23.108 --> 16:26.111
- That's a pound, Uncle Roy.
- Bill me.

16:26.737 --> 16:29.114
Okay. Now, open Jamie's gift.

16:29.907 --> 16:33.076
It's stupid. It's dumb. I don't know.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.161
Here.

16:37.581 --> 16:40.501
It's your original England kit
from the 2014 World Cup.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.004
Your name's on the back there.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.719
I got 'em to change the E to a U.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.772
I love it.

17:08.737 --> 17:10.614
Yeah. You owe me a pound, Jamie.

17:11.323 --> 17:12.532
But I didn't say nothing.

17:12.532 --> 17:17.037
No, but you made me think it,
and that's basically the same thing.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.083
Yeah, fair play.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.292
Okay, my turn.

17:23.961 --> 17:24.962
All right.

17:25.462 --> 17:26.713
Who's that?

17:27.923 --> 17:28.924
Good wrapping, that.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.055
I made it at school.

17:35.639 --> 17:39.935
The colors spell your name.
Red, orange, yellow. Roy.

17:41.937 --> 17:45.232
She's been very excited to give it to you.

17:45.232 --> 17:46.358
What do you think?

17:47.526 --> 17:49.319
Well, I mean, I fucking love it.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.447
It was worth it.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.248
Thank you.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.795
Okay. Mum and I are going to put
our costumes on for the performance.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.424
Heads-up, team. There is an intermission.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.058
- Your sister is fit.
- I will cut your eyes out.

18:33.197 --> 18:35.449
Simi, what's going on?
I thought we were fully booked.

18:35.449 --> 18:37.034
All the reservations bailed.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.077
Well, except one.

18:40.829 --> 18:43.457
Hey, you. Look who it is.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.501
It is Pinky Dick.

18:47.461 --> 18:48.462
Sorry. I mean Sam.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.839
Of course you remember Francis.

18:51.715 --> 18:54.134
Charles, this is Pinky Dick.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.594
I mean Sam.

18:55.594 --> 18:58.472
Pinky-Dick-I-mean-Sam,
this is Charles Siziba,

18:58.472 --> 19:01.391
- food blogger for <i>The Times</i>.
- It is nice to meet you.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.311
Edwin has told me awful things about you.

19:05.646 --> 19:08.941
Charles is helping me find
the best West African chef in London

19:09.441 --> 19:14.404
because I'm starting my own Nigerian
restaurant but 20 meters from here.

19:14.404 --> 19:15.781
You're doing what?

19:16.281 --> 19:19.117
We are going to serve
the finest Nigerian cuisine,

19:19.117 --> 19:23.247
along with Chicago-style hot dogs,
because it's my favorite food.

19:24.456 --> 19:26.875
Oh, Sam. I mean Pinky Dick.

19:27.376 --> 19:30.629
Mr. Akufo found a tiny piece of glass
in his food.

19:30.629 --> 19:32.798
I assume our meal will be complimentary?

19:33.549 --> 19:35.384
Yeah, sure. Whatever.

19:35.384 --> 19:36.468
Good man.

19:37.594 --> 19:42.766
It is nice to put a name
to such an ugly, horrible face.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.524
I'm so sorry to see
that business is not going well.

19:50.524 --> 19:52.442
No. Actually, we were fully booked.

19:52.442 --> 19:54.069
We just had
a few last-second cancellations.

19:54.069 --> 19:57.114
That's because
all the reservations were me.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.784
Hello. Ola's Chop Life?

20:00.784 --> 20:03.954
Can I make a reservation for eight
for Wiafe.

20:04.454 --> 20:07.040
David Ettlemen, party of six.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.418
Starkey, party of four. Fab four.

20:09.918 --> 20:13.255
Table for 12, please. Last name Picard.

20:13.255 --> 20:17.718
And please, bring out
all of your finest African cheeses.

20:21.597 --> 20:23.807
- Good to see you, Edwin.
- Isn't it?

20:30.689 --> 20:35.694
Yes, I was so sad to hear that you were
not selected for Nigeria's national team.

20:36.612 --> 20:40.115
But I was happy to hear that
the Nigerian government was pleased

20:40.115 --> 20:45.787
to accept a free $20 million check from me
to keep you off the team.

20:47.247 --> 20:51.793
I will never stop, you Nigerian turd.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.881
Never ever.

20:57.049 --> 20:59.760
No, never.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.069
Please don't do this, Francis.

21:56.817 --> 21:59.444
- Stop right there.
- Sorry.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.321
- <i>What's the emergency?</i>
- Nathan?

22:01.321 --> 22:02.406
Yeah.

22:02.406 --> 22:04.950
Never mind, Officer. My son is home.

22:07.619 --> 22:08.871
You moved the key.

22:08.871 --> 22:10.080
Jesus Christ.

22:11.957 --> 22:13.041
Hey, Mum.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.753
Do you want anything to eat, dear?

22:16.753 --> 22:19.673
No, thank you.
I just wanna sleep actually.

22:25.012 --> 22:26.805
Well, if you're cooking,
I could eat something.

22:26.805 --> 22:28.182
Lloyd, stop.

22:28.182 --> 22:29.266
What?

23:03.133 --> 23:04.051
Leslie?

23:05.677 --> 23:09.181
- Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.
- It's okay. It's not too bad.

23:10.807 --> 23:11.808
Damn.

23:15.521 --> 23:16.522
How can I help, Rebecca?

23:17.439 --> 23:18.732
I just need some advice.

23:20.025 --> 23:21.777
- Keeley didn't text you back?
- She did not.

23:21.777 --> 23:23.237
- Ted?
- Can't find him.

23:23.237 --> 23:25.405
- Sassy?
- On a plane with no Wi-Fi.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.449
- Can you imagine that?
- Disgusting.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.535
- How about your mother?
- Are you fucking with me?

23:30.118 --> 23:32.871
I am flattered. Okay, let's do this shit.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.710
I don't want to be
part of the Akufo League.

23:39.294 --> 23:41.588
Why? Because he's
an emotionally erratic billionaire

23:41.588 --> 23:43.757
with the temperament
of one of those kids in Willy Wonka

23:43.757 --> 23:45.676
that gets murdered
at the chocolate factory?

23:46.760 --> 23:48.178
I don't think that's what happens, Leslie.

23:49.012 --> 23:52.683
I hate to break it to you, Rebecca,
but those children are dead.

23:54.476 --> 23:57.229
I think the only reason
Rupert has invited me in

23:57.229 --> 24:00.232
is because I'm a woman
and it'll make them look good.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.735
Who cares why Rupert invited you?

24:03.735 --> 24:05.404
You've got a seat at the table.

24:06.238 --> 24:07.739
So go and see what's what.

24:14.872 --> 24:16.164
Thank you, Leslie.

24:17.624 --> 24:21.253
And if any of the other people
start disappearing one by one

24:21.253 --> 24:25.549
due to a series of unfortunate accidents
seemingly caused by their own hubris,

24:25.549 --> 24:27.509
you get the hell out of there.
Do you hear me?

25:07.508 --> 25:09.134
Everything all right, dear?

25:09.134 --> 25:10.844
Everything? Fuck no.

25:12.221 --> 25:15.098
What is it called when you have
the opposite of the Midas touch?

25:15.766 --> 25:18.393
- The Midas shits.
- That's it. That's what I have.

25:18.936 --> 25:20.270
Everything I touch turns to shit.

25:21.855 --> 25:23.774
Shit helps things grow, love.

25:25.192 --> 25:26.610
Oy, I'm Keeley. What's your name?

25:29.988 --> 25:32.491
- Mae.
- Mae? I wasn't expecting that.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.284
That's a really nice name.

25:35.118 --> 25:36.954
- Short for anything?
- Maybe.

25:36.954 --> 25:38.705
And is this your place, Maybe?

25:40.374 --> 25:41.834
Little over 40 years.

25:42.501 --> 25:44.878
Wow, that's impressive.

25:46.463 --> 25:48.507
It's hard though, right? Being a boss?

25:49.550 --> 25:50.634
It has its moments.

25:52.553 --> 25:54.763
But for some,
it's better to follow your gut

25:55.556 --> 25:58.475
than pretend to be excited
by following someone else's.

26:01.937 --> 26:04.273
What would you do
if someone took it all away from you?

26:06.650 --> 26:07.651
Like the man once said,

26:08.527 --> 26:10.612
"Once you make it
to the top of the mountain,

26:10.612 --> 26:13.365
what's left for you but lightning?"

26:18.328 --> 26:23.041
Wait, is the lightning
a good thing or a bad thing?

26:25.794 --> 26:28.255
Depends whether
you're ready for it or not.

26:30.757 --> 26:33.135
Now, I'm gonna get you some food.

26:34.386 --> 26:38.098
'Cause I can't have another sad,
skinny girl pass out in my pub.

26:38.724 --> 26:40.184
Fucks me Yelp rating.

27:35.656 --> 27:36.698
Bocce balls.

27:42.913 --> 27:46.124
Ted! Ted!

27:53.966 --> 27:54.967
Hey.

28:22.202 --> 28:23.203
Ye--

28:41.096 --> 28:44.141
<i>You know, Lanny,
when Mexico comes up here in our kitchen,</i>

28:44.141 --> 28:45.809
<i>the record books go right out the window.</i>

28:45.809 --> 28:47.060
<i>Well, for sure, Bruce.</i>

28:47.060 --> 28:49.605
<i>It's a tough game,
but there's a begrudging mutual respect</i>

28:49.605 --> 28:50.606
<i>between the two teams, hey?</i>

28:51.190 --> 28:55.611
<i>- They go together like nachos and poutine.
- Now you've made me hungry. Oh, no.</i>

28:57.196 --> 28:59.323
- <i>Mexico gains possession.</i>
- Here we go!

28:59.323 --> 29:02.868
<i>Dani Rojas is on the loose,
face-to-face with Van Damme. And--</i>

29:04.995 --> 29:07.873
<i>Oh, no! Right in the nose.</i>

29:07.873 --> 29:10.375
<i>Straight in the sniffer.
That almost seemed deliberate.</i>

29:10.375 --> 29:11.668
Dani kicked the crap out of it too.

29:11.668 --> 29:14.546
<i>For sure, Bruce.
He's a different fella in a Mexico shirt.</i>

29:14.546 --> 29:17.007
<i>That's a lot of blood, for gosh sakes.</i>

29:17.007 --> 29:18.717
<i>I apologize for the language there, folks.</i>

30:09.309 --> 30:10.310
Hey.

30:11.645 --> 30:12.646
Twins.

30:13.814 --> 30:15.649
Fuck's sake.

32:21.608 --> 32:23.652
All right, go on in.

32:27.030 --> 32:29.366
- Have a nice day, Uncle Roy.
- You too.

32:29.366 --> 32:30.367
You look nice.

32:31.326 --> 32:32.870
- Sure.
- Bye!

32:38.750 --> 32:39.960
It's Coach Kent.

32:43.630 --> 32:45.632
- Hello, Ms. Bowen.
- You don't have to call me Ms. Bowen.

32:45.632 --> 32:47.718
- You can use my first name.
- Okay...

32:49.178 --> 32:50.387
You don't know it, do you?

32:51.805 --> 32:52.890
No.

32:52.890 --> 32:55.267
- Leann.
- Hello, Leann.

32:55.267 --> 32:56.476
I like your T-shirt.

32:57.394 --> 32:58.812
You off to protest the Vietnam War?

33:00.772 --> 33:02.024
Phoebe made it for me.

33:05.027 --> 33:07.321
- You look different.
- Well, yeah.

33:07.321 --> 33:10.032
I don't normally dress
like a fucking clown.

33:10.032 --> 33:11.742
No, I don't mean the T-shirt. I mean you.

33:11.742 --> 33:14.161
You seem lighter
than the last time I saw you.

33:14.161 --> 33:17.664
Less... stuck.

33:18.248 --> 33:20.542
- Stuck?
- Yeah, stuck.

33:21.919 --> 33:22.961
Hold on.

33:24.338 --> 33:27.508
Weren't you flirting with me
last time I saw you?

33:29.343 --> 33:31.261
I teach kids.
I don't mind cleaning up a mess.

33:33.347 --> 33:35.849
I just hope that mess
didn't cause too much damage.

33:47.277 --> 33:50.030
Fudge.

33:53.909 --> 33:55.494
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

34:01.875 --> 34:03.585
"I don't mind cleaning up a mess."

34:04.086 --> 34:05.295
Smooth move, fuckwitch.

34:07.130 --> 34:08.590
All right, kids, let's go!

34:13.178 --> 34:14.346
Hi, Barbara.

34:14.346 --> 34:15.681
That's a nice outfit.

34:16.181 --> 34:19.101
Thank you. Yes.
I like clothes that tell the truth.

34:22.771 --> 34:24.022
I got you something.

34:34.741 --> 34:36.368
Thank you for all your help.

34:41.248 --> 34:43.458
I really wish
that we could have worked together longer.

34:43.458 --> 34:44.543
You're fun.

34:45.878 --> 34:47.504
- I am?
- Yeah.

34:51.675 --> 34:52.592
Thank you.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.349
It's just that
I have to buy the snow globe,

34:59.349 --> 35:00.434
or it doesn't really count.

35:02.311 --> 35:03.312
Okay.

35:05.063 --> 35:07.733
- Do you have any cash on you?
- Yes.

35:10.736 --> 35:12.070
It was actually 60 quid.

35:15.115 --> 35:17.492
I think you paid a bit too much there.

35:22.956 --> 35:24.124
Thank you for this.

35:26.543 --> 35:27.544
You're welcome.

35:29.588 --> 35:30.923
I'm gonna need the receipt.

35:31.715 --> 35:35.469
- Of course. Can I email it to you?
- Yeah, email's great.

35:35.469 --> 35:37.137
- Sooner the better.
- I'll get on it.

36:03.330 --> 36:07.125
Nathan, your father and I are headed
to the farmers' market for a few hours.

36:07.125 --> 36:09.169
We love you, sweetheart.

36:20.472 --> 36:21.640
Hello, there. Good morning.

36:23.892 --> 36:25.102
- Hello, madam.
- Hello there.

36:25.102 --> 36:27.271
- Can I take your coat?
- Oh, yes, absolutely.

36:28.897 --> 36:29.898
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:36.446 --> 36:37.823
Hello, Rebecca.

36:39.741 --> 36:40.659
Rupert.

36:40.659 --> 36:43.620
Thank you for accepting my invitation.

36:44.538 --> 36:46.790
How could I resist the chance
of having a bunch of old men

36:46.790 --> 36:47.875
speak directly to my chest?

36:50.586 --> 36:53.088
Mr. Mannion,
you left your phone in the car.

36:54.214 --> 36:56.842
And your fecalist emailed your results.

36:57.467 --> 36:59.970
Two big thumbs up as expected.

37:00.554 --> 37:01.430
Wonderful.

37:02.306 --> 37:05.142
Ms. Bread, Rebecca Welton.

37:05.142 --> 37:08.187
Rebecca, this is my assistant, Ms. Bread.

37:08.770 --> 37:10.022
Nice to meet you.

37:16.695 --> 37:18.030
Excuse me.

37:22.659 --> 37:24.536
- New assistant?
- Yeah.

37:25.662 --> 37:28.415
What happened
to the corporate pixie dream girl?

37:29.208 --> 37:31.043
Skewed. Dramatic.

37:34.046 --> 37:35.380
- Shall we?
- Yes.

37:38.509 --> 37:40.677
So, gentlemen, hello.

37:40.677 --> 37:45.098
I believe most of you know Rebecca,
owner of AFC Richmond.

37:46.141 --> 37:49.353
It's been my title since we got divorced,
and I took the only thing he ever loved.

37:50.687 --> 37:51.688
Wonderful.

37:53.398 --> 37:55.150
- Rebecca.
- Hello, Robert.

37:55.150 --> 37:57.611
When Rupert told me
you were joining us today,

37:57.611 --> 37:59.029
I was truly excited.

38:00.072 --> 38:04.868
Then when you walked in, in that outfit,
I remember why.

38:09.164 --> 38:10.499
Greetings to you all!

38:10.499 --> 38:12.459
And thank you for coming.

38:13.335 --> 38:14.378
Francis.

38:20.717 --> 38:22.344
- Rebecca.
- Mr. Akufo,

38:22.344 --> 38:24.346
how wonderful to see you again.

38:24.346 --> 38:26.807
Yes, I'm very glad that you are here.

38:28.141 --> 38:30.811
It's nice to not be
the only minority in the room, eh?

38:33.105 --> 38:38.443
Gentlemen and lady, I'm sure
you're all very anxious to get started.

38:38.986 --> 38:41.363
But as my father would say,

38:41.363 --> 38:44.741
"Never talk business on an empty stomach."

38:44.741 --> 38:45.909
So...

38:48.620 --> 38:53.834
Please take your seats and let us
enjoy some delicious Ghanaian bites

38:53.834 --> 38:56.295
as well as some Chicago-style hot dogs,

38:56.295 --> 38:59.965
as enjoyed by the likes of Scottie Pippen,
Obama and Ferris Bueller.

38:59.965 --> 39:01.049
Please.

39:03.177 --> 39:05.220
Yes, please. Please sit down. Sit down.

40:30.305 --> 40:31.306
Thanks.

40:39.439 --> 40:44.236
So, now that our bellies are full,
let us talk business.

40:44.236 --> 40:48.031
But first,
there is one thing to take care of.

41:03.213 --> 41:06.341
It's okay. I will leave now.

41:06.341 --> 41:09.469
Yeah, no, thank you, Nicolay.
It's just easier for everybody--

41:09.469 --> 41:11.722
No. I get it.

41:12.431 --> 41:15.893
It's just the whole Russia thing.
You know, it's not a good look right now.

41:17.519 --> 41:19.229
You-- It's a "pull."

41:20.147 --> 41:21.565
You have to pull. It's a--

41:21.565 --> 41:25.694
It's a-- You're pushing.
It's a pu-- You have to pull the door.

41:25.694 --> 41:26.945
What you're doing is obviously w--

41:28.113 --> 41:30.324
You're pushing, and you have to pull.

41:30.324 --> 41:31.909
There. Okay, goodbye.

41:31.909 --> 41:34.953
Okay, gentlemen. And one woman.

41:34.953 --> 41:39.958
I invited you here to tell you
about the Akufo League.

41:39.958 --> 41:45.130
A global football league
made up of only the best teams.

41:45.130 --> 41:50.594
Yes, it will cost the fans a bit more,
and some may not be able to afford it.

41:50.594 --> 41:54.890
But those who can will see
the cream of the crop.

41:54.890 --> 41:57.893
Each matchup, a clash of titans.

41:58.393 --> 42:01.355
Each game, an undried dream.

42:02.189 --> 42:05.943
Now, in the beginning,
some people will hate it

42:06.443 --> 42:09.154
because some people hate change.

42:09.738 --> 42:14.368
But remember, at one time,
we only rode horses

42:14.368 --> 42:16.870
and hated the idea of automobiles.

42:17.621 --> 42:19.790
Now we can't live without our cars,

42:19.790 --> 42:23.710
and the hot dogs we just ate
are 85% horse meat.

42:24.545 --> 42:26.880
Change is inevitable.

42:26.880 --> 42:29.716
Why should football not change?

42:29.716 --> 42:31.593
Why should it not evolve?

42:31.593 --> 42:35.597
Why should your profits
not grow exponentially?

42:38.225 --> 42:42.479
Yes, the fans will protest.
They will whine.

42:42.479 --> 42:46.233
They will make up mean-spirited
but admittedly clever parody songs

42:46.233 --> 42:50.028
using our surnames and sing them outside
the buildings that we own.

42:50.696 --> 42:56.910
But in time, they will come to embrace
the superior product.

42:56.910 --> 43:01.707
Just as we have all embraced
the automobile...

43:03.375 --> 43:04.376
the smartphone...

43:06.170 --> 43:07.504
the squatty potty.

43:09.381 --> 43:13.427
The Akufo League
is the future of football.

43:14.178 --> 43:16.263
And the future is now.

43:19.933 --> 43:23.020
Francis will pass out the projections
for the first five years.

43:23.520 --> 43:26.690
Please take a moment to peruse.

43:37.993 --> 43:38.869
Thank you.

43:41.371 --> 43:42.372
Thank you.

44:05.646 --> 44:06.647
Okay.

44:36.844 --> 44:38.053
- Yeah.
- Yes.

44:38.053 --> 44:42.099
Well, makes sense to me. I'm in.

44:42.850 --> 44:44.184
Wonderful.

44:49.147 --> 44:52.943
Rebecca, what do you think?

44:56.697 --> 44:58.782
Is this a fucking joke?

45:00.909 --> 45:02.035
Excuse me?

45:14.548 --> 45:17.342
What do you think you're doing?
Just stop it!

45:19.386 --> 45:21.930
I mean, how much more money
do any of you really need?

45:24.308 --> 45:28.187
Why would you ever consider
taking something away from people

45:28.187 --> 45:30.480
that means so much to them?

45:31.106 --> 45:32.524
This isn't a game.

45:34.568 --> 45:36.820
Football isn't just a game.

45:36.820 --> 45:39.031
<i>England dominating. No surprise.</i>

45:39.031 --> 45:44.494
<i>It's one of those amazing things in life
that can make you feel shit one moment...</i>

45:44.494 --> 45:47.581
<i>You'd expect Southgate
to be looking at his bench about now,</i>

45:47.581 --> 45:49.625
<i>and we do have a substitution.</i>

45:49.625 --> 45:53.420
<i>AFC Richmond's Jamie Tartt
winning his first cap for England.</i>

45:54.046 --> 45:56.215
<i>An unforgettable moment
and well-earned.</i>

45:57.424 --> 46:01.011
<i>And then,
like it's Christmas morning the next.</i>

46:01.011 --> 46:02.304
<i>Tartt's wearing 24,</i>

46:02.304 --> 46:06.016
<i>a nod to his Richmond teammate,
the spectacular Sam Obisanya.</i>

46:06.016 --> 46:09.978
<i>It has the ability to make
heroes and villains out of ordinary men.</i>

46:20.072 --> 46:22.324
<i>People love this game.</i>

46:22.991 --> 46:25.035
My father loved this game.

46:25.953 --> 46:28.288
You all used to love this game.

46:28.997 --> 46:30.207
I'm sure of it.

46:35.379 --> 46:40.217
I knew this little boy. Working-class.
From Richmond.

46:42.261 --> 46:47.224
And he loved football so much,
he used to sneak into the matches

46:47.224 --> 46:50.477
because his family
just couldn't afford the tickets.

46:51.854 --> 46:55.357
And one afternoon, he finally got caught.

46:58.110 --> 47:03.198
And the security guard smacked him
round the face, knocked him on the ground.

47:05.659 --> 47:09.705
But that little boy stood up, smiled,

47:11.498 --> 47:13.709
kicked the security guard in the bollocks
and ran away.

47:15.210 --> 47:16.211
Never to return.

47:17.546 --> 47:22.342
Until 25 years later, when he walked in
and bought the entire club.

47:24.386 --> 47:26.722
And on his first day as owner,

47:26.722 --> 47:29.933
he went and found that same security guard

47:30.434 --> 47:33.645
and gave him a pay rise
without any explanation.

47:37.816 --> 47:42.779
<i>Just because we own these teams
doesn't mean they belong to us.</i>

47:47.034 --> 47:49.453
<i>And I don't want to be part of something</i>

47:49.453 --> 47:53.665
<i>that could possibly destroy
this beautiful game.</i>

47:55.042 --> 47:59.546
Because I would hate for all
those little kids and grown-ups out there

47:59.546 --> 48:06.386
to ever lose access to that beautiful,
passionate part of themselves.

48:10.432 --> 48:12.434
What a lovely speech.

48:16.522 --> 48:19.149
Now, who wants to make a lot of money?

48:55.727 --> 48:56.937
Jesus fucking Christ!

48:58.188 --> 48:59.773
Hey, sorry.

49:01.316 --> 49:02.401
I thought you'd gone out.

49:02.401 --> 49:06.238
I did. But my acid reflux
started playing up, so I came home.

49:07.531 --> 49:08.699
I didn't know you had acid reflux.

49:09.867 --> 49:10.868
I don't.

49:11.451 --> 49:14.037
But your mother knows
I like my alone time.

49:15.998 --> 49:17.416
Sorry if I disturbed you.

49:18.834 --> 49:20.002
No, not at all.

49:22.462 --> 49:24.047
I really miss hearing you play.

49:26.341 --> 49:27.384
You do?

49:27.384 --> 49:28.510
Of course.

49:30.179 --> 49:31.930
Thought you hated it when I played.

49:33.599 --> 49:35.017
Why on earth would you think that?

49:36.685 --> 49:38.854
'Cause you literally said that
to me once, Dad.

49:39.438 --> 49:41.023
You said I wouldn't practice enough.

49:41.023 --> 49:44.610
How I was squandering my potential
and wasting my privilege.

49:48.238 --> 49:50.240
You were given opportunities I never had,

49:51.241 --> 49:53.076
and so I expected a lot from you.

49:55.245 --> 49:57.039
Well, it scared the shit out of me.

49:58.373 --> 49:59.541
I know that now.

50:00.501 --> 50:01.793
And I'm sorry.

50:03.879 --> 50:06.089
I didn't know how to parent a genius.

50:08.509 --> 50:09.510
What?

50:10.594 --> 50:11.595
A genius.

50:13.263 --> 50:14.473
You're brilliant, Son.

50:16.099 --> 50:18.143
You've always seen
things other people couldn't,

50:18.727 --> 50:19.728
and that's a blessing.

50:22.773 --> 50:24.983
Yeah, I know it must also be a curse too.

50:27.361 --> 50:28.362
But you're right.

50:30.489 --> 50:33.492
I pushed you to be the best at everything,
even at violin.

50:36.078 --> 50:37.829
'Cause I thought that's what I had to do.

50:39.665 --> 50:41.041
I thought that's what you wanted.

50:44.002 --> 50:46.880
I just liked playing.

50:49.550 --> 50:52.135
Nathan, be successful,
don't be successful.

50:53.178 --> 50:54.805
I never cared about any of that.

50:56.431 --> 50:58.308
I just want my son to be happy.

51:27.045 --> 51:29.756
Well, that was all very interesting.

51:30.382 --> 51:31.633
Lunch soon?

51:31.633 --> 51:32.593
Yeah, sure.

51:32.593 --> 51:35.888
Rebecca, you still look lovely.

51:39.725 --> 51:40.934
You know,

51:40.934 --> 51:44.021
the last time I saw you two alone
in a room together,

51:44.605 --> 51:45.814
was right after your wedding.

51:48.317 --> 51:50.277
You really wanted me to leave.

51:56.366 --> 51:59.453
Hey, remember when we--

51:59.953 --> 52:02.539
we both snuck
into a Richmond game together?

52:03.290 --> 52:04.291
I do.

52:05.042 --> 52:08.879
Although you were the owner of the club,
so the stakes were a little bit lower.

52:11.173 --> 52:14.092
You got-- May I?

52:14.092 --> 52:15.177
Oh, yeah.

52:26.438 --> 52:27.648
Rupert.

52:57.886 --> 53:00.889
- Oi, what you doing there?
- Jesus fucking Christ!

53:01.515 --> 53:03.225
Look at you in color.

53:03.225 --> 53:05.936
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

53:05.936 --> 53:07.521
But it's the middle of the day.

53:09.231 --> 53:10.274
What's that?

53:11.358 --> 53:12.901
It's for you.

53:17.698 --> 53:20.325
- You don't have to look now. You can--
- I don't mind.

53:35.424 --> 53:37.467
I still can't read your handwriting.

53:48.562 --> 53:52.149
"Dear Keeley,
I want you to know something.

53:53.317 --> 53:57.654
You never did anything wrong.
It was all me.

53:59.364 --> 54:02.826
I was stuck. Stuck in my own shit.

54:03.493 --> 54:07.372
And I didn't wanna cause you
any harm with it, so I pulled away.

54:09.583 --> 54:10.959
But you are..."

54:18.675 --> 54:24.181
You are and always will be
Keeley fucking Jones.

54:28.727 --> 54:30.521
And if I ever did anything--

54:32.940 --> 54:35.442
anything at all--

54:35.442 --> 54:37.861
that made you feel like that wasn't true...

54:40.405 --> 54:41.782
I'm so sorry.

54:45.452 --> 54:46.620
I love you.

54:53.252 --> 54:55.587
"Sincerely yours, Roy Kent. XOXO."

55:03.720 --> 55:05.347
You are the only Roy I know.

55:05.931 --> 55:09.142
- Well, I didn't want to assume.
- No.

55:18.110 --> 55:19.111
Thank you.

55:28.996 --> 55:29.997
Okay.

55:44.386 --> 55:45.387
I win.

55:46.555 --> 55:47.848
Come on.

55:51.560 --> 55:52.561
Come on.

56:03.655 --> 56:04.740
Have you been shot?

56:04.740 --> 56:07.284
I just convinced
a roomful of Rupert's dickhead friends

56:07.284 --> 56:08.827
to pull out of the Akufo League.

56:08.827 --> 56:11.705
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no, it's very good. Hug me.

56:11.705 --> 56:14.625
Oh, yes! I'm so proud of you!

56:14.625 --> 56:16.543
Even though I don't totally get it.

56:16.543 --> 56:18.462
Thank you. Wait.

56:18.462 --> 56:21.548
Now that I know that you're actually
alive, I'm very cross with you.

56:21.548 --> 56:22.925
Where the hell have you been?

56:24.718 --> 56:26.470
And they just pulled your funding?

56:27.304 --> 56:30.057
Arseholes. Why didn't you tell me?

56:31.183 --> 56:32.684
Well, I couldn't find the right time.

56:34.311 --> 56:35.687
And the right way.

56:36.939 --> 56:38.273
And I didn't want to.

56:39.733 --> 56:41.735
Well, they are idiots.

56:41.735 --> 56:44.655
Because you, Keeley Jones,
are a bloody marvel.

56:47.616 --> 56:49.076
How much money were they putting in?

56:50.077 --> 56:53.121
No. I'm not letting you do that.
It's a lot.

56:53.121 --> 56:56.416
Oh, shut up. My money, my choice.
Come on, tell me.

57:03.841 --> 57:04.842
What are you doing?

57:04.842 --> 57:07.344
This is how they do it in the movies.

57:16.228 --> 57:17.688
Are you joking?

57:18.480 --> 57:19.439
I told you.

57:20.649 --> 57:22.484
I think I have
that much money on me in cash.

57:23.110 --> 57:24.611
- No.
- Yes.

57:24.611 --> 57:26.154
- No!
- Yes.

57:27.197 --> 57:28.282
Thank you!

57:31.660 --> 57:33.912
- Rupert tried to kiss me.
- What?

57:35.038 --> 57:36.206
Did your lips touch?

57:36.206 --> 57:38.125
No, I pulled back straightaway.

57:39.960 --> 57:43.380
And I just looked at him
and made it all so clear.

57:45.549 --> 57:48.177
Babe, that's huge.

57:50.554 --> 57:55.058
Jesus. Can you imagine if you fell for it,
and you got back with Rupert?

57:55.058 --> 57:59.563
After all that floppy cock has done,
you would have to be insane.

57:59.563 --> 58:02.399
You would have to be
at the bottom of your emotional barrel

58:02.399 --> 58:04.318
to do something that dumb, right?

58:19.541 --> 58:20.626
Hi.

59:00.332 --> 59:01.750
Thanks, Renee.

59:08.006 --> 59:09.591
We've done some restructuring,

59:09.591 --> 59:16.223
but KJPR would still love to help you
take your sunglasses global, Ms. Jayye.

59:18.600 --> 59:22.437
I would maybe say
"ambitious nightmare" over "crazy."

59:22.437 --> 59:25.065
But yes, we have parted ways with Shandy.

59:25.732 --> 59:30.195
Okay. Of course. Great.
Yeah, talk to you soon.

59:32.030 --> 59:33.907
- Nice. Okay.
- Ms. Jones.

59:36.910 --> 59:39.580
Barbara, hi. What are you doing here?

59:41.623 --> 59:44.585
I need to give this back to you.

59:48.422 --> 59:50.549
I've given Jack my resignation,

59:50.549 --> 59:55.053
and I only buy a snow globe
when I leave a job.

59:56.638 --> 59:59.308
I mean, that is,
if you're looking for a CFO.

59:59.308 --> 01:00:01.393
I mean, I might not-- It's--

01:00:11.904 --> 01:00:13.030
Would you mind loosening your grip?

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:15.657
'Cause I need to get the receipt
so you can reimburse me.

01:00:15.657 --> 01:00:17.034
Thank you.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:27.961
How are you?

01:00:34.885 --> 01:00:35.761
<i>Hola, amigo</i>.

01:00:37.095 --> 01:00:38.430
<i>Hola</i>.

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:40.098
How's your nose feeling, man?

01:00:41.391 --> 01:00:42.226
It feels broken.

01:00:44.311 --> 01:00:45.687
It was such a crazy game, right?

01:00:46.271 --> 01:00:48.106
I mean, yeah. Yeah, it was.

01:00:48.941 --> 01:00:50.359
So many memories.

01:00:52.152 --> 01:00:55.614
He's hit the ball with his nose.
Top ten moments in sports history.

01:00:55.614 --> 01:00:57.574
- You good?
- Hey. Yeah, not bad.

01:01:21.431 --> 01:01:22.975
So where are you from originally?

01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:24.810
None of your business.

01:01:24.810 --> 01:01:27.396
Yeah, it is a bit personal.

01:01:55.549 --> 01:01:56.633
I'm from Peoria.

01:02:06.143 --> 01:02:08.312
- Morning, boss.
- Good morning, Ted.

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:11.106
That's cool! Did you draw that?

01:02:12.608 --> 01:02:14.151
No, Ted, that's a David Hockney.

01:02:14.151 --> 01:02:16.111
Oh, well, he's a very talented little boy.

01:02:16.737 --> 01:02:17.988
There you go.

01:02:20.741 --> 01:02:25.370
Ted, I want to share something with you
that I've realized recently.

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:27.831
How weird it is that Margherita pizza
doesn't have alcohol in it?

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:28.790
I'm with you, sister.

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:33.504
No, Ted. I've realized
I no longer care if I beat Rupert.

01:02:34.421 --> 01:02:35.923
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:02:36.632 --> 01:02:38.133
I mean, I still want to win.

01:02:39.384 --> 01:02:40.636
But for all of us.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:44.348
For Richmond.

01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:47.184
I wanna win for us too.

01:02:53.023 --> 01:02:55.067
It just feels like it's ceremonial
at this point.

01:02:55.067 --> 01:02:58.403
As long as none of that tree piss gets
in my mouth, I'm actually okay with it.
