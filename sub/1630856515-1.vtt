02:45.296 --> 02:47.213
Shit, shit, shit.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.421
Babe, shit. Please answer the phone.

03:13.046 --> 03:15.588
Come on! Come on, come on.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.088
Come on.

03:19.463 --> 03:22.796
<i>Hey, Enno's voicemail here.
No idea why I still have one.</i>

03:22.796 --> 03:26.796
<i>- Just leave a message.</i>
- He is fine. He is definitely fine.

03:27.796 --> 03:30.838
Babe, please. Shit, answer your phone.
I need you.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.755
No.

03:35.838 --> 03:38.255
No.

03:40.130 --> 03:41.130
Fuck.

03:54.630 --> 03:55.921
Fuck!

03:59.255 --> 04:00.255
Fuck!

04:18.255 --> 04:19.505
Fuck.

04:23.005 --> 04:25.130
- Mone.
<i>- Hola, chica.</i>

04:25.130 --> 04:27.380
<i>Did you see
how small its arms and legs are?</i>

04:27.380 --> 04:30.296
<i>- Mone.
- Olaf doesn't want to find out the gender,</i>

04:30.296 --> 04:31.713
<i>- but...</i>
- Listen to me.

04:31.713 --> 04:33.588
<i>- You don't want to know either?</i>
- No...

04:33.588 --> 04:35.713
<i>- That's hipster bullshit.</i>
- Call the police.

04:35.713 --> 04:37.921
I'm in really big trouble!

04:39.796 --> 04:40.755
Mone?

04:40.755 --> 04:43.421
<i>Okay, Malina, not funny
and totally inappropriate.</i>

04:43.421 --> 04:46.171
<i>Hi, I'd like a small portion of fries...</i>

04:46.171 --> 04:47.463
Fuck.

04:48.380 --> 04:51.005
- You can't be serious.
<i>- A big portion.</i>

04:51.005 --> 04:53.505
- You are such a...
<i>- Ketchup and mayo, apple pie.</i>

04:53.505 --> 04:54.588
<i>Hey, I'm back.</i>

04:54.588 --> 04:56.880
<i>- I'm having my first pregnancy craving.</i>
- You...

04:56.880 --> 04:59.963
<i>- Will I eat pickles with whipped cream?</i>
- You have to help me.

04:59.963 --> 05:01.796
<i>- What?</i>
- I've been kidnapped

05:01.796 --> 05:04.005
and trapped in a trunk.
No idea how I got here

05:04.005 --> 05:05.796
- or where Enno is.
<i>- What?</i>

05:05.796 --> 05:09.796
I am scared something happened to him.
You have to help us. Please!

05:09.796 --> 05:13.963
<i>- Do you think this is funny?</i>
- The police have to look for me!

05:13.963 --> 05:15.463
I'll send you the location.

05:15.713 --> 05:16.796
<i>- Okay, Lina...</i>
- Okay?

05:16.796 --> 05:18.671
<i>I don't understand a word,</i>

05:18.671 --> 05:22.130
<i>but I think it's just horrible
that in this wonderful moment,</i>

05:22.130 --> 05:24.921
<i>you have to make it about you
and your weird boyfriend.</i>

05:25.463 --> 05:27.463
<i>I thought you'd be happy
to become an aunt.</i>

05:27.463 --> 05:31.671
<i>You'll understand when you grow up...</i>

05:31.671 --> 05:34.213
Shut up. Shut up!

06:03.671 --> 06:05.963
FIM intact.

06:06.505 --> 06:10.546
No lower leg fracture.
No angular malalignment.

06:14.588 --> 06:17.255
Just move already, you stupid legs.

06:19.796 --> 06:21.921
Right up to the spinal canal...

06:23.213 --> 06:24.713
Shit.

07:24.546 --> 07:25.796
<i>Good morning.</i>

07:34.130 --> 07:36.463
<i>You are soaking everything
with your sweat.</i>

07:36.463 --> 07:38.671
<i>I should throw you into the lake.</i>

07:38.671 --> 07:40.796
<i>Oh, coffee! Awesome. Thank you.</i>

07:40.796 --> 07:42.796
<i>I also made you breakfast.</i>

07:42.796 --> 07:44.838
<i>Without help from your housekeeper?</i>

07:44.838 --> 07:46.796
<i>That's almost too good
to be true, princess.</i>

07:46.796 --> 07:51.713
<i>- Your princess commands you to get up.
- Yummy. No. Stop. No.</i>

07:53.588 --> 07:56.130
<i>Are you having as much fun as me?</i>

07:59.296 --> 08:00.671
<i>Ready for our big adventure?</i>

08:00.671 --> 08:01.755
<i>More ready than you.</i>

08:01.755 --> 08:03.713
<i>You are well-equipped
for such undertakings.</i>

08:03.713 --> 08:06.630
<i>Mom and Dad got me everything
I need.</i>

08:07.421 --> 08:09.171
<i>We have no time for this.</i>

08:09.171 --> 08:12.963
<i>You have to calibrate your route,
so it shows us the way.</i>

08:12.963 --> 08:15.838
<i>No, we have to be
at the rest stop on time.</i>

08:15.838 --> 08:18.796
<i>If no one picks us up,
then we won't make our flight.</i>

08:19.255 --> 08:21.755
<i>And my tired face
does not need to be filmed.</i>

08:21.755 --> 08:24.380
<i>You'll be happy for the memories later.</i>

08:26.046 --> 08:27.671
<i>Malina, stop it now!</i>

08:43.713 --> 08:45.630
<i>Hey! You... Good God...</i>

09:37.921 --> 09:39.296
Don't do it.

10:32.963 --> 10:34.838
Mone Voss
Good luck with that

10:34.838 --> 10:36.588
Freeing yourself
from the trunk of a car

10:36.588 --> 10:39.505
Good luck with that

10:39.505 --> 10:41.630
Just go and fuck yourself, Mon...

10:53.088 --> 10:55.755
Call the police immediately.
This is no joke.

10:57.713 --> 10:59.755
No wonder we ran away.

11:15.421 --> 11:17.921
"Being trapped in the trunk of a car

11:17.921 --> 11:20.505
can be a terrible,
even deadly, experience."

11:22.255 --> 11:23.296
You don't say.

11:23.296 --> 11:26.755
"Unfortunately, it's not easy
to free yourself.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.796
First try to open the lock.

11:33.796 --> 11:36.755
What could kill you is hyperventilation.

11:36.755 --> 11:39.338
So breathe evenly and don't panic.

11:39.338 --> 11:44.796
<i>Try to pry open any latches.
You might be able to find a trunk opener.</i>

11:44.796 --> 11:48.005
<i>The trunk where you are trapped
might not have one,</i>

11:48.005 --> 11:50.630
unless you installed one yourself.

11:52.255 --> 11:55.838
It is, however,
worth to try and find one.

11:55.838 --> 11:56.963
Just in case.

12:01.213 --> 12:04.130
<i>Check if you can push
the brake lights out.</i>

12:04.130 --> 12:08.130
For this, pry open the covering,
behind which the lights are located.

12:09.463 --> 12:12.421
Even if I you don't manage to do it,
you increase the chance

12:12.421 --> 12:15.796
that the driver might be stopped
by the police

12:15.796 --> 12:17.963
in the case you are being kidnapped."

12:26.380 --> 12:28.088
Don't abandon me.

12:30.421 --> 12:32.296
Oh, my God, yes.

12:32.671 --> 12:34.921
I have a signal! I'll call you back, Dad!

12:43.880 --> 12:45.380
<i>Police Emergency Services, Kühne.</i>

12:45.380 --> 12:47.755
I am trapped in a trunk. Help me!

12:47.755 --> 12:49.880
I have been kidnapped.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.755
<i>- Are you injured?</i>
- My legs are numb,

12:51.755 --> 12:53.921
and I am super scared.

12:53.921 --> 12:57.213
- Maybe it was an epidural.
<i>- You took ecstasy?</i>

12:57.213 --> 12:59.630
- No!
<i>- Are you under the influence of drugs?</i>

12:59.630 --> 13:01.546
The kidnapper drugged me.

13:01.546 --> 13:04.546
I don't have enough imagination
to come up with shit like this.

13:04.546 --> 13:07.088
I am just very scared
and I need your help.

13:08.963 --> 13:12.130
<i>- What's your name?</i>
- Malina. Malina Voss.

13:12.130 --> 13:15.380
<i>- Malina Voss. What's your date of birth?</i>
- June 6th, 1996.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.796
<i>Hey, just be quiet for a moment, okay?
Thank you.</i>

13:19.255 --> 13:21.463
<i>Excuse me, just one second please.</i>

13:23.463 --> 13:26.880
<i>- So, Malina Emilia Voss?</i>
- Yes.

13:27.546 --> 13:28.963
<i>Okay, I have your details.</i>

13:29.796 --> 13:31.671
<i>Have you tried opening the trunk?</i>

13:31.671 --> 13:33.380
I've tried the wikiHow instructions.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.296
- You have to get me out of here!
<i>- I'll be right back.</i>

13:36.296 --> 13:38.421
- Don't leave me alone!
<i>- No.</i>

13:38.421 --> 13:41.588
- Don't leave me alone!
<i>- Hey, I won't leave you alone.</i>

13:41.588 --> 13:45.296
<i>Okay? We'll take care of you, Malina.</i>

13:45.296 --> 13:49.046
<i>If the call gets cut off,
I'll make sure to reach you again.</i>

13:49.046 --> 13:50.838
<i>Everything will be fine.</i>

13:50.838 --> 13:52.796
<i>Wait a moment, okay?</i>

13:55.588 --> 13:57.046
Fuck!

13:59.255 --> 14:01.921
<i>Malina, do you know
where the car is located?</i>

14:02.255 --> 14:04.005
Can't you just track my cell phone?

14:04.005 --> 14:07.380
<i>Sadly, we only see the nearest cell tower
in your surrounding area.</i>

14:07.380 --> 14:11.338
<i>That's why it's important
that you stay on the line</i>

14:11.338 --> 14:13.796
<i>and try to tell us your exact location.</i>

14:16.505 --> 14:18.338
I am...

14:19.046 --> 14:22.296
on a country road in the,

14:22.838 --> 14:24.671
Upper Ilz area.

14:24.671 --> 14:28.255
<i>That's a giant area.
Try to give me more information.</i>

14:28.255 --> 14:31.421
<i>Road names, upcoming crossings, something.</i>

14:31.421 --> 14:33.921
That will take too long,
by then Enno will...

14:33.921 --> 14:35.171
<i>Was someone else with you?</i>

14:35.171 --> 14:38.755
We were about to go on vacation.
Six months in South America.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.463
<i>Okay. And Enno is your boyfriend?</i>

14:41.463 --> 14:45.755
My fiancé. Enno Bent,
born on December 12, 1989, before you ask.

14:45.755 --> 14:48.421
The guy put a gun to his head...

14:48.421 --> 14:51.088
<i>Is the weapon still in the car?</i>

14:51.088 --> 14:53.005
- I can't reach him.
<i>- Where is the gun?</i>

14:53.005 --> 14:55.838
- Not in the trunk.
<i>- Okay, Bent, Benno.</i>

14:55.838 --> 14:59.505
<i>Enno, sorry.
My colleague is trying to contact him.</i>

14:59.505 --> 15:02.421
<i>We have to get you out of there
as soon as possible.</i>

15:02.421 --> 15:04.880
<i>Do you know what kind of car
you are in?</i>

15:04.880 --> 15:07.505
<i>- The make?</i>
- Shit, I didn't pay attention to that.

15:07.505 --> 15:09.713
<i>Do you know the color maybe?</i>

15:09.713 --> 15:13.046
I think it's dark green.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.338
On the video it looks old.

15:15.338 --> 15:17.630
<i>- You have a video?</i>
- I recorded it in secret.

15:17.630 --> 15:20.046
<i>- Is the license plate visible?</i>
- Not visible, damn it.

15:20.046 --> 15:22.171
<i>Okay, think about the dark green car.</i>

15:22.171 --> 15:24.880
<i>Can you remember anything else?</i>

15:24.880 --> 15:28.171
<i>- What condition is it in?</i>
- It's missing one of the side mirrors.

15:28.171 --> 15:29.171
<i>Anything else?</i>

15:31.713 --> 15:35.005
Oh, yes. There are
a lot of heavy metal stickers on the car.

15:35.463 --> 15:36.880
Shit.

15:37.838 --> 15:40.046
<i>Do you know where you got in?</i>

15:40.838 --> 15:44.755
At a rest stop. Somewhere rural.
Near Dresden or Erfurt.

15:44.755 --> 15:46.963
<i>- So, you were hitchhiking?</i>
- It was stupid.

15:47.421 --> 15:49.796
I felt safe, I was with Enno.

15:50.963 --> 15:53.338
<i>Malina, this is very important.</i>

15:53.338 --> 15:57.380
<i>You have to describe
what the driver of the car looks like.</i>

15:57.380 --> 15:59.671
I took a picture of his face.

15:59.671 --> 16:03.755
<i>Even better! Maybe my colleagues
will be able to identify the man.</i>

16:03.755 --> 16:06.046
DAD NOW
Malina call me back THIS SECOND!!!

16:06.213 --> 16:09.671
- Shit. Please don't hang up, okay?
<i>- Hang on...</i>

16:09.671 --> 16:11.505
<i>Malina, what? Of course not. Wait.</i>

16:14.296 --> 16:15.546
<i>Malini, where are you?</i>

16:15.546 --> 16:18.838
<i>I got a disturbing message.
Please tell me it's not true.</i>

16:18.838 --> 16:20.796
I can't. Dad...

16:20.796 --> 16:24.880
<i>Is this your way of telling me
you're running off with your boyfriend?</i>

16:24.880 --> 16:27.296
<i>- Is this one of your stupid jokes?</i>
- No.

16:27.296 --> 16:29.880
<i>I said to keep me out of it.
Do I have to repeat it?</i>

16:29.880 --> 16:33.921
Does this sound like a joke?
Does Mone still not get it?

16:33.921 --> 16:36.713
<i>Mone?
What does your sister have to do with it?</i>

16:36.713 --> 16:38.213
Didn't she call you?

16:38.213 --> 16:40.171
<i>- It was an anonymous message.</i>
- Wait.

16:40.171 --> 16:44.880
<i>Someone wants me to pay 250,000 euros.
What's going on? Damn it!</i>

16:44.880 --> 16:47.421
Wait, wait, they want a ransom?

16:47.421 --> 16:50.463
<i>- Ransom? So this isn't a prank?</i>
- Dad, I've been kidnapped.

16:50.463 --> 16:52.546
- I don't know...
<i>- Oh, God.</i>

16:52.546 --> 16:54.796
Listen, you have to help me, okay?

16:54.796 --> 16:57.505
- I'll send you a photo.
<i>- How are you? Are you injured?</i>

16:57.505 --> 17:00.755
- No. If only I knew.
<i>- Who are these people? Where are you?</i>

17:00.755 --> 17:03.421
<i>- Who is doing this to us?</i>
- Now listen. Dad, please!

17:03.421 --> 17:08.630
<i>Okay, okay.
Do you think it's the Gabriels?</i>

17:08.880 --> 17:12.463
No! I'd never seen the guy
who kidnapped me before.

17:12.463 --> 17:16.380
<i>I wouldn't put it past them.
Maybe they hired someone, those pigs.</i>

17:16.380 --> 17:19.463
<i>- I'll finish them!</i>
- This is no damn Liam Neeson movie.

17:19.463 --> 17:22.088
Listen, I'm sending you a text

17:22.088 --> 17:24.088
with a photo of this guy, okay?

17:24.088 --> 17:26.713
<i>How dare they attack you?</i>

17:26.838 --> 17:29.838
Then immediately contact the police
and send it to them.

17:30.546 --> 17:31.713
<i>Police?</i>

17:32.505 --> 17:33.630
<i>I can't do that.</i>

17:33.630 --> 17:36.005
- Yes?
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

17:36.005 --> 17:37.421
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

17:37.421 --> 17:40.796
<i>It says here that this is exactly
what I shouldn't do</i>

17:40.796 --> 17:42.630
<i>if I want to get you back alive!</i>

17:43.213 --> 17:46.546
<i>By the time they find him,
you might already be...</i>

17:46.546 --> 17:51.088
<i>I would never forgive myself.
I could never forgive myself.</i>

17:51.088 --> 17:54.463
You should always inform the police.

17:54.463 --> 17:56.505
<i>What do we know?</i>

17:56.505 --> 18:01.046
<i>What if they are serious? Shit.
What if they tapped our cell phones?</i>

18:02.338 --> 18:04.005
Who else could help me?

18:04.005 --> 18:06.255
<i>They are after my money.</i>

18:06.255 --> 18:09.255
<i>I can only save you if I pay immediately.</i>

18:09.255 --> 18:13.963
<i>- Holy shit.</i>
- But still... The police...

18:13.963 --> 18:17.463
<i>They'll kill you!
It says so here in black and white.</i>

18:18.046 --> 18:21.171
<i>"Not a single word to the police."</i>

19:06.005 --> 19:07.088
Please, no.

19:24.005 --> 19:26.546
Please no, please no.

19:42.338 --> 19:43.421
Fuck!

20:31.630 --> 20:32.713
Fuck!

20:46.796 --> 20:48.005
That's so disgusting.

21:56.255 --> 21:58.046
Okay, okay...

22:08.130 --> 22:10.088
Lie down now.

22:11.838 --> 22:14.088
And take your top off.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.838
Come on.

22:24.255 --> 22:25.380
Come on.

22:56.796 --> 23:01.046
Try to remain calm.
You are in good hands here.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.963
I'll count down from three, okay?

23:04.505 --> 23:06.713
Three... two...

23:56.963 --> 23:59.338
No, no, no.

24:01.296 --> 24:05.838
This looks worse than it is.
Please stay calm.

24:05.838 --> 24:09.338
You can lose up to 1 liter of blood
before falling unconscious.

24:09.338 --> 24:13.380
And this is just about a small latte.

24:18.588 --> 24:20.296
How was your evening?
most beautiful

24:20.296 --> 24:22.755
Probably the most beautiful message
I have ever received

24:25.546 --> 24:26.546
<i>Hey.</i>

24:26.546 --> 24:27.463
<i>Hey there.</i>

24:29.880 --> 24:32.713
<i>I just wanted to send you
this voice message to tell you.</i>

24:32.713 --> 24:34.671
<i>I thought it was nice today.</i>

24:34.671 --> 24:36.130
<i>And,</i>

24:36.505 --> 24:41.130
<i>I was just thinking for a really long time
and went through all the people</i>

24:41.130 --> 24:42.880
<i>who I've been close with...</i>

24:42.880 --> 24:47.005
<i>Not just romantic relationships,
but also family, friends,</i>

24:47.005 --> 24:48.421
<i>the probation officer.</i>

24:50.505 --> 24:51.838
<i>I'm kidding.</i>

24:51.838 --> 24:53.463
<i>I know this sounds really corny,</i>

24:54.213 --> 24:57.505
<i>but I have never felt so comfortable
with anyone my whole life...</i>

24:59.463 --> 25:01.796
<i>the way I did last weekend with you.</i>

25:01.796 --> 25:03.921
<i>I know, super cheesy.</i>

25:08.296 --> 25:11.296
<i>I just really wanted you to know
how important you are to me.</i>

25:11.296 --> 25:12.296
<i>And,</i>

25:12.296 --> 25:15.005
<i>whether anyone else is just
as important to me right now?</i>

25:15.005 --> 25:17.171
<i>Well,</i> I doubt it.

25:17.171 --> 25:19.005
<i>That's why I also don't care</i>

25:19.005 --> 25:21.880
<i>if your dad wants to drown me or whatever.</i>

25:22.380 --> 25:25.005
<i>You know, as long as you stand by me,</i>

25:27.296 --> 25:28.838
<i>then I found my place in the world.</i>

25:29.463 --> 25:31.171
<i>Finally found my place.</i>

25:31.921 --> 25:33.505
<i>I already mentioned this.</i>

25:33.921 --> 25:38.046
<i>- My family wasn't always great to me.
- Come on, connect, please.</i>

25:38.046 --> 25:39.213
Shit.

25:39.213 --> 25:40.880
<i>You are the first person</i>

25:41.421 --> 25:45.130
<i>with whom I could see myself starting
a family of my own, anyway.</i>

25:45.130 --> 25:49.630
<i>I mean, just think about
how fucking cute our kids would be.</i>

25:49.630 --> 25:50.963
<i>What about three?</i>

25:51.671 --> 25:53.838
<i>Three is a good number, right?</i>

25:55.546 --> 26:00.171
<i>Well, I would like to start young,
but you also get a say, of course.</i>

26:12.755 --> 26:16.921
<i>Malina, thank God, finally!
You got to try to stay on the line.</i>

26:16.921 --> 26:18.671
Dad says I shouldn't talk to you.

26:18.671 --> 26:22.921
<i>- That makes no sense. Your dad...</i>
- What if they listen in on our calls?

26:22.921 --> 26:24.963
And kill me just for that?

26:24.963 --> 26:28.255
<i>No. A kidnapping is like an exchange deal.</i>

26:28.255 --> 26:30.213
<i>They need you unharmed.</i>

26:30.213 --> 26:33.671
Yes? They can no longer
let me go unharmed.

26:33.671 --> 26:37.171
<i>Why, what do you mean? What happened?</i>

26:37.546 --> 26:39.463
This conversation is too risky for me.

26:39.796 --> 26:42.130
<i>Malina, you know that's nonsense.</i>

26:42.130 --> 26:46.338
<i>You have to help us to help you.
That's our only chance.</i>

26:52.088 --> 26:53.880
How do you want to help me?

26:54.755 --> 26:56.380
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

26:59.255 --> 27:01.630
I think they cut out one
of my kidneys.

27:02.380 --> 27:04.880
<i>- What?</i>
- They are organ dealers or something.

27:06.546 --> 27:09.463
Well? You don't have
a standard procedure for this?

27:10.255 --> 27:13.171
<i>I can try and get
an emergency doctor on the line.</i>

27:13.171 --> 27:15.463
<i>- Are you bleeding heavily?</i>
- Not anymore.

27:16.046 --> 27:19.255
<i>- Did you have some bandages with you?</i>
- No, but a nice pair of sneakers.

27:19.255 --> 27:21.546
<i>What? What do you mean?</i>

27:21.546 --> 27:23.921
I managed to close the wound.

27:25.796 --> 27:28.338
<i>That is really,</i>

27:28.838 --> 27:30.838
<i>very impressive, Malina.</i>

27:30.838 --> 27:33.630
A medical degree has to be good
for something.

27:34.380 --> 27:37.963
I know that the numb legs
don't mean that I'm paralyzed.

27:37.963 --> 27:42.380
It doesn't matter. When we arrive
at 4:30, they'll kill me.

27:43.130 --> 27:44.796
<i>- At 4:30?</i>
- Yes.

27:44.796 --> 27:47.796
<i>Tell Stigelegger the time limit is 4:30.</i>

27:47.796 --> 27:50.463
Can you physically hold out
a little longer?

27:50.463 --> 27:53.421
I'm slowly starting to feel my legs again.

27:53.421 --> 27:56.671
I wish not that wasn't the case.
That won't be a good feeling.

27:56.671 --> 28:00.171
<i>- Adrenaline will help.</i>
- I thought you wanted to help me.

28:00.171 --> 28:03.005
<i>Two unmarked police cars
are looking for you,</i>

28:03.005 --> 28:05.755
<i>but they could still use more information.</i>

28:07.630 --> 28:11.171
I wish I could remember the license plate
or the rest stop.

28:11.463 --> 28:13.421
But I'm not good at that sort of thing.

28:13.421 --> 28:16.755
Enno would have been able to remember
all the important shit.

28:16.755 --> 28:19.963
<i>I disagree.
Your cooperation is exemplary.</i>

28:19.963 --> 28:22.380
Do you have much to compare it with?

28:22.380 --> 28:25.088
<i>- Let's work more on this...</i>
- Tell me.

28:28.546 --> 28:31.296
You are not allowed to tell me the truth?

28:32.838 --> 28:34.963
<i>There is no standard procedure.</i>

28:35.421 --> 28:37.838
<i>You have to trust me.
I'm doing everything...</i>

28:37.838 --> 28:39.630
- Do you think I'll get out of here?
<i>- Yes.</i>

28:39.630 --> 28:42.338
- Why?
<i>- Cause I'd never forgive myself otherwise.</i>

28:43.380 --> 28:47.296
I can't forgive myself for some things,
but they happened anyway.

28:48.838 --> 28:51.338
<i>I can't change what happened.</i>

28:51.338 --> 28:55.296
<i>But I won't give up.
And I want you to do the same.</i>

28:56.255 --> 28:59.505
That's easy to say, when you're
currently not bleeding in a trunk.

28:59.505 --> 29:02.755
<i>I'm not saying
that I know what I would do in your place.</i>

29:02.755 --> 29:05.671
<i>But I'll do everything
in my power to help you.</i>

29:05.671 --> 29:06.963
What's your name?

29:08.588 --> 29:11.630
<i>- Elisa.</i>
- Why are you not here yet, Elisa?

29:11.630 --> 29:16.046
<i>I haven't got as many cars
at this time of night as I'd like.</i>

29:16.046 --> 29:18.963
<i>And we can only see the transmission
angle of your location</i>

29:18.963 --> 29:21.046
<i>to the tower, but not the distance.</i>

29:21.046 --> 29:22.338
You mean,

29:22.880 --> 29:25.255
It's like playing Scotland Yard?

29:25.255 --> 29:28.421
You can only check every fifth move?

29:28.963 --> 29:32.171
<i>That's why you have to keep telling us
more about your location.</i>

29:32.171 --> 29:35.296
Fuck, fuck! It's still on.

29:35.296 --> 29:37.046
<i>What's still on?</i>

29:37.046 --> 29:40.296
Is there anything worse
than Internet service on the highway?

29:40.296 --> 29:42.130
<i>No, definitely not.</i>

29:42.130 --> 29:44.046
This can't be happening now.

29:44.046 --> 29:46.921
<i>- You have...</i>
-"Your Internet speed is reduced,

29:46.921 --> 29:49.713
as your data has been used up.

29:49.713 --> 29:51.380
Please change to a Speed-On Plan."

29:51.380 --> 29:54.546
- I am so stupid.
<i>- Try to stay calm.</i>

29:54.546 --> 29:57.046
<i>- You are doing great.</i>
- You could be here already.

29:57.046 --> 29:59.338
But this is only my first kidnapping.

29:59.338 --> 30:01.421
<i>Please don't make a habit of it.</i>

30:01.421 --> 30:03.255
<i>- Can</i> you top up the credit?
- Yes.

30:03.255 --> 30:05.963
"Please type 'Okay' to confirm."

30:08.255 --> 30:09.921
Come on. Come on.

30:11.880 --> 30:14.630
"We couldn't reset your data."

30:14.630 --> 30:18.796
Fuck you! Fuck you, you sons of bitches!
Fuck you, "Have a nice day"!

30:23.463 --> 30:24.630
<i>Malina?</i>

30:27.130 --> 30:29.088
We stopped.

30:30.380 --> 30:34.588
<i>Please try to look out for anything
that could lead us to where you are.</i>

30:34.588 --> 30:38.796
<i>Bell towers, sounds of trains,
station announcements, all that, okay?</i>

30:39.046 --> 30:41.046
I can't hear anything.

30:44.005 --> 30:45.505
<i>Listen, there is something else.</i>

30:45.505 --> 30:47.755
<i>We are in touch with your dad now.</i>

30:47.755 --> 30:51.296
What?
He said I wasn't supposed to talk to you.

30:51.296 --> 30:54.963
<i>I don't think you should listen
to everything he tells you to do.</i>

30:54.963 --> 30:57.005
<i>But I can connect you.</i>

31:00.005 --> 31:01.130
I can't.

31:01.838 --> 31:04.963
- Can he hear us right now?
<i>- No, he can't.</i>

31:05.338 --> 31:08.671
<i>I told him not to call you
so the line stays open.</i>

31:11.005 --> 31:13.671
- Did he send you the photo?
<i>- Not now!</i>

31:14.671 --> 31:18.380
<i>He has the photo?
Why didn't he tell us that right away?</i>

31:18.380 --> 31:22.005
<i>Her dad has the photo of the kidnapper.
He has to send it to us now.</i>

31:23.088 --> 31:24.671
<i>Malina?</i>

31:24.671 --> 31:26.463
<i>Malina, are you there?</i>

31:26.880 --> 31:28.088
<i>Malina?</i>

31:37.755 --> 31:39.588
We are at a gas station.

31:39.588 --> 31:41.255
<i>Great! We'll check that out.</i>

31:41.255 --> 31:45.296
<i>Listen, when the driver goes to pay,
you call for help, okay?</i>

31:52.421 --> 31:53.255
Are you sure?

31:53.255 --> 31:56.380
<i>This is your chance
to draw attention to yourself.</i>

31:56.380 --> 31:57.505
<i>Are they on their way?</i>

31:59.505 --> 32:01.005
<i>How many gas stations can there be?</i>

32:14.796 --> 32:17.921
Help!

32:17.921 --> 32:19.338
I am in here!

32:19.338 --> 32:21.130
Help!

32:24.213 --> 32:26.671
Yes! Yes! Here! In here...

32:26.671 --> 32:28.171
<i>- Help me!
- Have you got someone?</i>

32:31.296 --> 32:34.838
<i>Tell the person to break the lock
to alarm the staff.</i>

32:34.838 --> 32:36.963
<i>- Open the trunk, please!
- Continue!</i>

32:36.963 --> 32:40.296
<i>- What now? No, I don't need...
- Help!</i>

32:40.296 --> 32:43.421
<i>- Shit, pass him to me and I explain it.
- Hello!</i>

32:43.421 --> 32:45.880
<i>Malina, I'll be right back, okay?</i>

33:27.255 --> 33:29.546
<i>-Malina, did it work?</i>
- Help!

33:29.546 --> 33:30.963
Help!

33:32.380 --> 33:34.338
Help!

33:55.046 --> 33:57.755
- Please! Please stop!
<i>- You see?</i>

36:03.921 --> 36:05.546
Now they are watching me
I will try...

36:14.338 --> 36:15.588
They are watching me

36:15.588 --> 36:17.088
Stay strong
I love you

36:17.088 --> 36:20.046
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

36:26.130 --> 36:27.630
<i>Those were the times,</i>

36:27.630 --> 36:33.088
<i>when "The Safety Dance"
played in the Butan Club in Wuppertal.</i>

36:34.046 --> 36:36.296
- Enno is alive.
<i>- Malina! Thank goodness.</i>

36:36.296 --> 36:38.796
<i>We have a sign of life from Enno Bent.</i>

36:38.796 --> 36:40.255
They're holding him somewhere.

36:40.255 --> 36:42.755
<i>Several perpetrators.
The driver and one with Enno.</i>

36:42.755 --> 36:44.963
<i>The gas station gave us a lead.</i>

36:44.963 --> 36:47.463
<i>There are only two gas stations
in your radius.</i>

36:47.463 --> 36:50.213
Look for an empty whiskey bottle.
That's the right place.

36:50.213 --> 36:52.921
<i>My colleagues are already on their way.
They'll check the CCTV.</i>

36:52.921 --> 36:56.630
They must take the bottle.
It has that motherfucker's DNA.

36:56.630 --> 37:00.046
<i>- Good work, Malina!</i>
- You can use it to get him, right?

37:00.046 --> 37:02.296
<i>If he is in our database, yes.</i>

37:02.296 --> 37:06.213
<i>I'm just afraid that the DNA result
won't be ready tonight.</i>

37:06.213 --> 37:09.671
Seriously?
Can't your CSI guys hurry up a bit?

37:09.671 --> 37:13.046
<i>Maybe we can still identify
the perpetrator.</i>

37:13.046 --> 37:15.796
<i>Your dad has sent us the photo.</i>

37:15.796 --> 37:17.880
And did you recognize him?

37:17.880 --> 37:20.546
<i>- No, but your dad did.</i>
- What?

37:20.546 --> 37:25.046
<i>He is sure that he saw the man
at his hospital one or two weeks ago.</i>

37:25.046 --> 37:27.005
They chose me because I'm his daughter?

37:27.005 --> 37:29.171
Is this really just about money?

37:29.671 --> 37:32.255
<i>He doesn't know the man,
but he has a suspicion.</i>

37:32.255 --> 37:35.755
Maybe I can get out of here,
no matter how bad this guy pretends to be.

37:35.755 --> 37:39.630
It's just a show!
My dad just has to transfer the money.

37:39.630 --> 37:41.796
<i>That's also our hope, yes.</i>

37:42.713 --> 37:44.046
What's the problem?

37:44.046 --> 37:47.213
<i>We have to wait
and see how the situation develops.</i>

37:47.213 --> 37:50.630
Tell me what's going on.
Or do you worry you'll ruin my day?

37:51.921 --> 37:54.421
<i>Your dad doesn't want
to pay the ransom yet.</i>

37:54.421 --> 37:57.838
<i>He's using it as leverage
to get us to look into his suspicion.</i>

38:00.338 --> 38:01.630
The Gabriels.

38:01.630 --> 38:03.630
<i>We are already looking into this lead,</i>

38:03.630 --> 38:06.046
<i>so I think
we'll be able to convince him soon.</i>

38:06.505 --> 38:08.171
I could strangle him right now.

38:08.171 --> 38:10.505
Even for him, that's just the next level.

38:11.963 --> 38:14.005
<i>Why is he so sure of this?</i>

38:14.005 --> 38:16.213
<i>Who are these Gabriels?</i>

38:19.005 --> 38:20.463
<i>Malina?</i>

38:22.963 --> 38:25.671
Of course, it was an accident, but I...

38:27.421 --> 38:32.505
I... During my second emergency surgery...

38:34.838 --> 38:37.255
I killed someone.

38:39.505 --> 38:43.046
The girl's family blames me. The Gabriels.

38:43.588 --> 38:47.380
They hate me.
But her condition was critical and...

38:48.046 --> 38:50.671
There should have been
an attending physician present,

38:50.671 --> 38:54.046
but the scalpel was in my hand,
even though it shouldn't have been.

38:55.046 --> 38:58.338
<i>"Shit rolls downhill",</i> as we say.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.796
And also,
I don't know if he told you this,

39:02.713 --> 39:05.296
my dad believes that

39:05.296 --> 39:09.796
it was my mistake
that made her kidney fail in the end.

39:09.796 --> 39:11.421
And I think he's right.

39:11.421 --> 39:13.213
<i>- Kidney failure?</i>
- Yes.

39:13.755 --> 39:15.505
<i>Did the family threaten you?</i>

39:16.338 --> 39:18.838
<i>When was the last time
you were in contact with them?</i>

39:18.838 --> 39:21.963
At first, they wanted to sue me.
They were so terribly angry.

39:21.963 --> 39:24.463
But then I never heard back from them.

39:24.463 --> 39:27.338
Maybe I deserve
to kick the bucket like this.

39:27.338 --> 39:30.213
Alone, in a puddle of blood and vomit.

39:30.213 --> 39:31.630
<i>Malina, please.</i>

39:32.338 --> 39:35.296
Some doctors quit after one dead patient.

39:35.296 --> 39:37.921
It might be best that I am one of them.

39:38.380 --> 39:42.171
Your operation skills
are definitely telling a different story.

39:42.171 --> 39:46.421
My Dad would finally have a reason
to be proud of me.

39:46.880 --> 39:49.588
<i>Promise me you'll give your medical career
another chance</i>

39:49.588 --> 39:51.005
<i>when you get back home.</i>

39:51.005 --> 39:53.796
You mean, if I make it out of here alive.

39:55.671 --> 39:57.588
<i>I haven't heard a promise.</i>

39:58.838 --> 40:01.421
<i>Don't forget that I'm with the police.</i>

40:01.421 --> 40:04.755
<i>That's not their jurisdiction.
CID should handle it.</i>

40:04.755 --> 40:10.130
Enno also encouraged me
to go back to the hospital.

40:10.130 --> 40:14.380
He showed up shortly after that
with his niece

40:14.380 --> 40:17.296
and told her that I was the only one
who could make her well again.

40:17.296 --> 40:22.046
He is so good with children.
He wants at least three of them.

40:22.755 --> 40:25.171
How am I supposed to cope without him?

40:25.171 --> 40:28.213
You have to get him back for me!
Seriously!

40:28.213 --> 40:32.380
Without him I couldn't...
I know I couldn't be able to survive this.

40:32.380 --> 40:35.463
<i>- Try to stay calm.</i>
- No, I...

40:35.463 --> 40:38.130
<i>- Malina. Listen to my voice.</i>
- I want to go to him.

40:38.130 --> 40:40.296
<i>I believe in you. You are strong!</i>

40:40.713 --> 40:43.255
No, I am not strong.

40:43.255 --> 40:47.130
<i>Okay, okay.
Tell me about how you and Enno met.</i>

40:48.130 --> 40:50.713
<i>Come on.
I am sure you still remember that.</i>

40:51.921 --> 40:56.380
- It was... because of a saline solution.
<i>- Yes?</i>

40:56.380 --> 40:58.880
<i>- Saline?</i>
- Yes.

40:58.880 --> 41:04.130
Enno drank too much at a work party
and then passed out.

41:04.130 --> 41:07.838
I gave him the solution
in the ward at night.

41:07.838 --> 41:11.588
He was so embarrassed
that he sobered up immediately.

41:12.380 --> 41:14.088
<i>Like drunks, when they see my uniform.</i>

41:14.088 --> 41:15.463
He was so cute.

41:16.713 --> 41:20.880
He hid flowers and his phone number for me
under the plate cover.

41:21.671 --> 41:23.546
That was 18 months ago.

41:23.546 --> 41:26.630
My family still can't accept it.

41:26.630 --> 41:28.213
<i>Why?</i>

41:29.171 --> 41:30.588
They are jealous.

41:30.588 --> 41:34.338
I mean, of course I want to spend
all the time with the person,

41:34.338 --> 41:37.130
without whom I feel weak and helpless.

41:37.963 --> 41:40.755
They are jealous. They don't get it.

41:41.171 --> 41:44.171
Even though my Dad and Enno
are quite similar.

41:44.171 --> 41:48.046
Sometimes I even confuse
which of the two said what to me.

41:48.755 --> 41:52.838
I was probably such a nervous wreck.

41:52.838 --> 41:56.046
And that's why when Enno asked me

41:56.046 --> 42:00.838
if I wanted to travel to South America
with him next week for six months.

42:01.963 --> 42:04.255
<i>You just started to pack.</i>

42:04.255 --> 42:06.838
My dad would have disinherited me
right away.

42:07.380 --> 42:08.796
<i>Your dad is quite something.</i>

42:08.796 --> 42:10.963
That's why
I didn't want to say anything at first.

42:10.963 --> 42:12.463
I was such a coward.

42:13.921 --> 42:18.713
I didn't say goodbye to anyone. There was
no way I could have known that I...

42:18.713 --> 42:20.130
<i>Stay calm, Malina.</i>

42:20.130 --> 42:22.588
- I can't stay calm any longer.
<i>- Please try.</i>

42:22.588 --> 42:25.630
- How am I supposed to...
<i>- Have you ever been to South America?</i>

42:26.505 --> 42:29.088
- No.
<i>- I went to Peru two years ago.</i>

42:29.088 --> 42:31.171
<i>It's really beautiful there.</i>

42:31.796 --> 42:34.421
<i>- Do you know the Rainbow Mountain?</i>
- I am not sure.

42:35.213 --> 42:37.880
That's a mountain
that has seven different colors.

42:37.880 --> 42:39.713
<i>Like a rainbow, for real.</i>

42:39.713 --> 42:44.005
<i>- As if the Teletubbies lived there.</i>
- I always liked the Teletubbies.

42:44.005 --> 42:45.005
<i>Really? Not me.</i>

42:46.338 --> 42:49.463
<i>But at Rainbow Mountain
I changed my mind.</i>

42:49.463 --> 42:51.588
<i>Trust me, you definitely have to go there.</i>

42:51.588 --> 42:53.713
<i>Did you want to go
to Peru on your vacation?</i>

42:53.713 --> 42:58.671
Now I want to go there just to look
at those damn colorful mountains.

42:59.463 --> 43:00.921
<i>Trust me, you will.</i>

43:00.921 --> 43:02.796
Do you have a boyfriend?

43:03.255 --> 43:05.755
<i>I was in a relationship
with someone for six years,</i>

43:05.755 --> 43:07.963
<i>but I have more fun when I travel alone.</i>

43:07.963 --> 43:09.171
Why?

43:09.171 --> 43:11.546
<i>It became apparent that she...</i>

43:11.546 --> 43:13.171
<i>How can I put this?</i>

43:13.171 --> 43:15.171
<i>That she was a total bitch.</i>

43:17.338 --> 43:19.838
Is that a special police term?

43:20.546 --> 43:23.921
<i>Yes, I'm obligated to tell you the truth
and she was a bitch.</i>

43:24.963 --> 43:27.296
It's cool that you travel alone.

43:28.130 --> 43:30.880
I always need someone with me.

43:32.005 --> 43:33.880
That's why I don't like it when we fight.

43:34.671 --> 43:35.921
But sometimes...

43:36.880 --> 43:38.630
I can't control myself.

43:39.255 --> 43:42.505
<i>Yes, then they should hurry up
for a change!</i>

43:43.005 --> 43:45.671
<i>I need roadblocks, and not just one!</i>

43:45.671 --> 43:47.213
<i>And that fucking license plate!</i>

43:47.213 --> 43:50.296
Why roadblocks? What about the ransom?

43:50.296 --> 43:53.130
<i>- Even if he pays, we must be ready.</i>
- Even if?

43:53.130 --> 43:56.338
<i>- Malina...</i>
- Elisa?

43:57.130 --> 43:58.255
Elisa!

44:01.880 --> 44:03.880
You can't be fucking serious!

44:04.421 --> 44:07.796
And Dad, just pay the fucking money,
damn it!

44:17.421 --> 44:19.505
Call the poli--

44:24.088 --> 44:26.421
Call the police if you can
Ask for Elisa Kuhne

44:26.421 --> 44:28.005
"Stay strong,

44:28.963 --> 44:31.338
I love you."

45:12.338 --> 45:13.213
Yes.

45:13.213 --> 45:14.630
Come on.

47:03.213 --> 47:04.380
Thank you, motherfucker.

47:48.046 --> 47:49.338
I can't help it.

48:35.630 --> 48:39.546
My ears, you bastard!

49:03.213 --> 49:04.880
Help! I'm in here!

49:04.880 --> 49:06.671
Help!

49:12.671 --> 49:14.171
Help!

49:15.213 --> 49:17.880
Please, come quickly! In the trunk!

49:22.255 --> 49:23.755
I'm here in the trunk!

49:25.963 --> 49:27.421
Help me!

49:29.171 --> 49:30.755
Yes! Yes, come on!

49:30.755 --> 49:32.546
In here! Help!

49:33.005 --> 49:34.171
Quick!

49:35.796 --> 49:37.088
Here.

49:52.505 --> 49:54.171
Oh, fuck.

50:13.546 --> 50:14.921
Oh, God. Fuck.

50:50.505 --> 50:51.838
Fuck.

50:59.005 --> 51:00.171
Fuck.

51:09.546 --> 51:12.213
Three and a half liters.
Everything is fine.

51:12.671 --> 51:13.963
Everything is fine.

51:14.755 --> 51:15.880
Fuck.

51:17.088 --> 51:18.505

MyBase
Welcome to the Czech Republic

51:48.088 --> 51:49.130
No.

51:51.505 --> 51:52.963
No, please no.

53:08.713 --> 53:12.713
<i>Malina, thank goodness.
There was a hit and run in a traffic jam.</i>

53:12.713 --> 53:14.296
<i>- Was that you guys?</i>
- Yes.

53:15.088 --> 53:17.796
I seem to be involved
in every fucked-up situation tonight.

53:18.588 --> 53:21.130
<i>- Have you been injured?</i>
- I'm in Czechia.

53:21.130 --> 53:24.546
<i>- I know, we are trying...</i>
- We drove over the border

53:24.671 --> 53:27.255
and we'll shortly arrive somewhere
where they will kill me.

53:27.255 --> 53:29.713
<i>We are talking to the border police
about roadblocks.</i>

53:29.713 --> 53:31.630
<i>There is a bilateral agreement...</i>

53:31.630 --> 53:34.838
Please tell me
that you finally have the license plate.

53:35.421 --> 53:39.671
<i>Accidents are very stressful
for all involved parties. Their memory...</i>

53:39.671 --> 53:41.880
Please spare me the official bullshit!

53:41.880 --> 53:45.963
<i>We have the first letters,
but the witnesses contradict each other.</i>

53:45.963 --> 53:47.505
What about the gas station?

53:48.005 --> 53:49.005
<i>It's complicated.</i>

53:49.005 --> 53:53.046
<i>The employee is new and doesn't know
how to access the server room...</i>

53:53.046 --> 53:55.005
- What? Are you kidding?
<i>- ...with the footage.</i>

53:55.005 --> 53:56.671
<i>But a car is on its way...</i>

53:56.671 --> 53:59.296
I'll die if you don't get me out of here!

53:59.296 --> 54:01.171
<i>I won't let it that happen.</i>

54:01.171 --> 54:04.213
Did my dad pay? Have you reached Enno?

54:05.921 --> 54:07.505
<i>No.</i>

54:09.588 --> 54:10.463
<i>What was that?</i>

54:35.963 --> 54:37.255
Come on.

54:44.505 --> 54:45.588
Four...

54:50.880 --> 54:51.755
Seven...

54:52.671 --> 54:53.630
One.

54:58.130 --> 55:00.546
Seven.

55:01.171 --> 55:03.421
Seven, one, four.

55:04.005 --> 55:05.963
Seven, one, four.

55:08.088 --> 55:09.255
Come on.

55:27.088 --> 55:28.755
Seven, one, four.

55:31.755 --> 55:33.005
Come on in.

55:38.880 --> 55:41.963
OTC417. OTC417.

55:44.546 --> 55:47.213
OTC417. I got him.

55:50.505 --> 55:51.380
<i>Hello?</i>

55:55.463 --> 55:56.296
Enno?

55:57.796 --> 55:58.713
Is that you?

56:01.588 --> 56:02.671
Are you hurt?

56:04.963 --> 56:07.046
Don't keep me waiting. Say something.

56:12.796 --> 56:13.755
<i>Yes.</i>

56:15.671 --> 56:16.713
Oh, God...

56:17.338 --> 56:21.005
- It's good to hear your voice.
<i>- I understand that you are afraid.</i>

56:21.838 --> 56:23.005
<i>I am scared, too.</i>

56:24.380 --> 56:26.630
<i>- Mr. Voss...</i>
- Mr. Voss?

56:27.255 --> 56:32.171
<i>Listen, they promised me
that they would let Malina and I go,</i>

56:32.171 --> 56:34.005
<i>- if you pay the money.</i>
- Can they hear you?

56:35.713 --> 56:37.546
<i>We have to believe them.</i>

56:37.546 --> 56:39.171
<i>We have no other choice.</i>

56:39.171 --> 56:41.421
Do you know who they are?

56:43.713 --> 56:44.588
<i>Listen...</i>

56:52.338 --> 56:53.713
Did they do something to you?

56:55.296 --> 56:57.171
<i>Yes, it looks that way.</i>

56:57.671 --> 56:59.671
<i>If you don't pay, then...</i>

56:59.671 --> 57:01.213
<i>they'll kill us.</i>

57:01.921 --> 57:04.088
<i>It could be over for me at any moment.</i>

57:05.046 --> 57:07.005
<i>Even if that doesn't matter to you,</i>

57:07.005 --> 57:09.171
<i>please think of your daughter's life.</i>

57:10.921 --> 57:13.838
<i>Save your battery,
so that we can contact you.</i>

57:13.838 --> 57:17.880
- Babe. The police are coming for you.
<i>- Poli...</i>

57:17.880 --> 57:19.880
- They'll get you out of there.
<i>- No, the...</i>

57:19.880 --> 57:21.713
They have roadblocks and...

57:21.713 --> 57:25.588
Then we will find you.
And these guys will go to jail, okay?

57:38.630 --> 57:39.630
Are you here?

57:41.171 --> 57:42.338
In the car?

57:46.046 --> 57:47.255
<i>Looks like it.</i>

57:52.921 --> 57:55.046
Can you attract
the attention of the police?

57:55.338 --> 57:56.963
<i>Mr. Voss, don't even think about it.</i>

57:57.088 --> 58:00.255
<i>If the police stop the car, I'm dead.</i>

58:00.255 --> 58:01.505
<i>And so is Malina.</i>

58:01.505 --> 58:03.921
<i>We still have half an hour. If you pay,</i>

58:04.755 --> 58:06.588
<i>you'll get your daughter back.</i>

58:42.796 --> 58:44.546
<i>Your dad paid.</i>

58:44.546 --> 58:47.505
What? Oh, my God, finally.

58:47.505 --> 58:48.630
<i>Yes.</i>

58:49.213 --> 58:50.505
<i>However...</i>

58:51.046 --> 58:54.630
<i>until now, there hasn't been any reaction
by the kidnappers.</i>

58:54.630 --> 58:58.755
<i>But we know now that the ransom demand
was not done by professionals.</i>

59:00.921 --> 59:02.213
What does that mean?

59:02.838 --> 59:07.171
<i>CID says the text was
sent via an anonymous online text service.</i>

59:07.171 --> 59:11.546
<i>These providers are required to give us
the details of the sender.</i>

59:11.546 --> 59:13.296
<i>We're waiting to hear from them.</i>

59:14.088 --> 59:16.671
Don't tell my dad.
He'll want his money back

59:16.671 --> 59:19.005
because the demand was not professional.

59:19.005 --> 59:21.671
<i>He no longer thinks it's the Gabriels.</i>

59:21.671 --> 59:25.088
<i>The money has been transferred.
We get no reply. We have no new suspects.</i>

59:25.088 --> 59:27.463
<i>We have to act now. It's our best chance.</i>

59:27.463 --> 59:29.296
What? No!

59:29.296 --> 59:32.171
<i>- Trust us. Roadblocks are effective...</i>
- No, no.

59:32.171 --> 59:33.755
You have to wait longer.

59:33.755 --> 59:35.630
<i>We have to try now.</i>

59:35.630 --> 59:38.588
<i>Even if we don't know
the license plate yet.</i>

59:43.838 --> 59:44.963
<i>Malina.</i>

59:47.296 --> 59:49.296
<i>Malina, are you still there?</i>

59:51.338 --> 59:54.838
- Yes.
<i>- Do you understand?</i>

59:55.380 --> 59:58.463
<i>You will hear a car horn twice
before we act.</i>

59:58.463 --> 01:00:02.505
<i>That's the signal. It has to be like this,
since we only have your rough location.</i>

01:00:02.505 --> 01:00:04.213
Elisa, I have to check something.

01:00:06.421 --> 01:00:08.880
<i>You have a new message.</i>

01:00:09.921 --> 01:00:14.588
<i>Malini, I simply can't reach you.
I have taken care of the ransom money.</i>

01:00:14.588 --> 01:00:17.755
<i>Forget the Gabriels,
they have nothing to do with it.</i>

01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:20.505
<i>I had to check that myself.</i>

01:00:20.505 --> 01:00:23.755
<i>I already once paid these bastards
a lot of money</i>

01:00:23.755 --> 01:00:26.005
<i>so they would drop the lawsuit.</i>

01:00:26.421 --> 01:00:32.171
<i>I didn't want you to... Your reputation
would have been ruined forever.</i>

01:00:32.171 --> 01:00:35.505
<i>And mine too. Damn it.
I couldn't allow that.</i>

01:00:35.505 --> 01:00:37.796
<i>How was I supposed
to tell the police this?</i>

01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:41.671
<i>Now you've found out anyway.</i>

01:00:42.755 --> 01:00:45.380
<i>If only this thing
hadn't happened back then.</i>

01:00:46.255 --> 01:00:50.130
<i>Lini, I just want you to come back home.</i>

01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:12.921
Be very quiet.
Then we'll get out of here.

01:01:12.921 --> 01:01:15.963
If they notice you we're dead.

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:19.171
<i>Good evening. Would you mind telling me
why you are in such a hurry?</i>

01:01:19.463 --> 01:01:22.838
<i>Hello? But I cannot tell you that,</i>

01:01:22.838 --> 01:01:25.130
<i>otherwise I'd have to give you a lift.</i>

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:27.963
<i>Is the darling sitting next to you
more talkative?</i>

01:03:49.421 --> 01:03:51.088
<i>Are you going fast right now?</i>

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:54.713
- We are going slow.
<i>- Then we'll get to you soon.</i>

01:03:54.713 --> 01:03:57.880
- I don't understand.
<i>- We got the video footage.</i>

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.338
<i>Dark green Audi.
My colleagues will be with you soon.</i>

01:04:00.338 --> 01:04:02.713
You didn't stop us at any roadblock.

01:04:02.713 --> 01:04:04.421
<i>You took a different route.</i>

01:04:04.421 --> 01:04:08.130
<i>But we are following you and will try
to stop the car in two minutes.</i>

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:10.338
Do you know
where the ransom demand came from?

01:04:10.338 --> 01:04:12.338
<i>- That is not important.</i>
- Yes...

01:04:12.338 --> 01:04:15.046
<i>- We have to...</i>
- But they will let us go.

01:04:15.046 --> 01:04:16.880
<i>- We can't rely on that.</i>
- But...

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.921
<i>- We have to act!</i>
- I... Do you have the number?

01:04:19.921 --> 01:04:22.671
<i>- That's no longer important!</i>
- Can you give it to me?

01:04:22.671 --> 01:04:24.213
<i>- What for, we...</i>
- Please!

01:04:24.213 --> 01:04:25.421
<i>Okay.</i>

01:04:26.588 --> 01:04:28.921
<i>Hang on. So...</i>

01:04:28.921 --> 01:04:30.546
<i>- That's the number?</i>
- Yes.

01:04:30.546 --> 01:04:33.463
<i>It's 017299...</i>

01:04:34.255 --> 01:04:35.505
<i>68...</i>

01:04:35.505 --> 01:04:37.296
<i>- 532.</i>
- 532.

01:04:44.088 --> 01:04:46.921
Maybe I have an infection
and this is a feverish dream.

01:04:46.921 --> 01:04:49.338
<i>We will be with you any minute now.</i>

01:04:49.338 --> 01:04:52.171
Or I have a vision and I am about to die.

01:04:54.046 --> 01:04:56.005
<i>My colleagues can't see you.</i>

01:04:56.838 --> 01:04:59.005
<i>- Are you driving very fast right now?</i>
- No.

01:04:59.005 --> 01:05:02.130
- We're not moving at all.
<i>- That can't be right.</i>

01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:05.880
Elisa, I think I'm losing my mind.

01:05:06.963 --> 01:05:08.880
<i>- Oh, no.</i>
- What?

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:10.838
What is it this time?

01:05:12.213 --> 01:05:14.088
<i>Can you hear water nearby?</i>

01:05:14.963 --> 01:05:20.546
Make... make it stop.
Make it so that it's not true. Okay?

01:05:25.713 --> 01:05:26.921
The barrier...

01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:30.046
We are on a ferry.

01:05:30.046 --> 01:05:33.255
<i>Damn it. Stigelegger,
why can't they hurry up more?</i>

01:05:35.755 --> 01:05:37.088
<i>You are crossing a lake.</i>

01:05:37.505 --> 01:05:39.671
<i>We have to drive around it.
It will take time.</i>

01:05:39.796 --> 01:05:42.255
<i>Maybe we can catch you on the other side.</i>

01:05:42.255 --> 01:05:45.713
<i>- I will try to make it work.</i>
- Do you think it will work?

01:05:48.088 --> 01:05:50.088
<i>You are my first kidnapping. I...</i>

01:05:51.546 --> 01:05:54.505
<i>I'm doing everything I can, Malina.
I want to save you.</i>

01:05:54.921 --> 01:05:57.921
<i>I won't abandon you.
I would never forgive myself for that.</i>

01:05:59.671 --> 01:06:03.963
I told you, things still happen.

01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:06.880
But I am not angry with you, Elisa.

01:06:08.171 --> 01:06:10.838
I have finally understood
that I cannot trust anyone.

01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:50.880
Tell me the truth.

01:07:13.671 --> 01:07:15.255
Enno, what's going on here?

01:07:18.755 --> 01:07:20.671
<i>You have to know that I'm sorry.</i>

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.588
<i>I didn't want this. Do you believe me?</i>

01:07:24.588 --> 01:07:26.921
I don't know what to believe anymore.

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:29.796
<i>The thing with your kidney...</i>

01:07:31.630 --> 01:07:35.296
<i>I didn't know about that.
They weren't supposed to keep you.</i>

01:07:35.296 --> 01:07:38.171
<i>- It should've been different.</i>
- How was it supposed to be?

01:07:38.921 --> 01:07:41.796
<i>They were supposed to release you
once they had the money.</i>

01:07:41.796 --> 01:07:44.046
<i>Nothing was supposed to happen to you.
And...</i>

01:07:44.505 --> 01:07:46.296
<i>I would've been gone from your life.</i>

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.380
How could you do that to me?

01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:51.546
<i>Don't you know
what it's like when you have no way out?</i>

01:07:51.546 --> 01:07:54.005
<i>In your perfect world,
you can't even imagine</i>

01:07:54.005 --> 01:07:56.505
<i>the shit I am currently in.</i>

01:07:56.505 --> 01:08:00.296
<i>If they had stuck to the plan,
you would have gotten rid of me, too.</i>

01:08:00.296 --> 01:08:01.880
<i>I'm not good for you.</i>

01:08:02.421 --> 01:08:05.088
<i>I'm not good for anyone.
You could've met someone new...</i>

01:08:05.088 --> 01:08:07.963
But... but all I ever wanted was you.

01:08:08.713 --> 01:08:10.630
<i>I don't know
if I can get out of this alive.</i>

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:13.755
How did you get into this?

01:08:14.463 --> 01:08:15.963
<i>Does that even fucking matter?</i>

01:08:15.963 --> 01:08:17.838
Why keep secrets now?

01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:21.338
<i>I had problems for a while
that I didn't tell you about.</i>

01:08:21.338 --> 01:08:22.421
Why?

01:08:23.963 --> 01:08:25.838
<i>You couldn't have handled it, princess.</i>

01:08:27.963 --> 01:08:31.588
So you also think
that I'm too weak for everything?

01:08:32.005 --> 01:08:34.921
<i>At first it was just interests
that cost a lot of money.</i>

01:08:34.921 --> 01:08:36.255
- What kind?
<i>- More than...</i>

01:08:36.255 --> 01:08:39.546
<i>- People you shouldn't do business with.</i>
- What kind?

01:08:39.546 --> 01:08:41.671
<i>It's like building a house of cards,</i>

01:08:41.671 --> 01:08:43.171
<i>- and a guy lets...</i>
- Enno!

01:08:43.171 --> 01:08:45.796
<i>- ...leaves the window open and you...</i>
- What hobbies?

01:08:45.796 --> 01:08:50.713
<i>Problems nonstop. Debts, all that shit.
But that doesn't matter anymore.</i>

01:08:50.713 --> 01:08:52.630
<i>I started at some point...</i>

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:54.296
<i>Well, I needed the money.</i>

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.755
<i>Then I got into shady deals, yeah.</i>

01:08:56.755 --> 01:09:00.588
<i>I sold drugs I stole from the hospital.
Your dad's car.</i>

01:09:00.588 --> 01:09:03.421
<i>You can imagine what happened to it.</i>

01:09:03.421 --> 01:09:05.963
Is that why you tried to persuade me
to continue?

01:09:05.963 --> 01:09:09.755
<i>- I tried everything.</i>
- So you could keep selling drugs?

01:09:10.463 --> 01:09:13.213
<i>- I believed in you, okay?</i>
- Tell me the truth!

01:09:14.213 --> 01:09:15.796
<i>It was another reason.</i>

01:09:16.338 --> 01:09:18.921
<i>I still believe you are a great doctor.</i>

01:09:28.213 --> 01:09:29.213
Was...

01:09:30.588 --> 01:09:32.130
Was it all a lie?

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:37.588
<i>- No. No, no, no.</i>
- Right from the start?

01:09:37.588 --> 01:09:39.588
<i>No, I really liked you.</i>

01:09:40.755 --> 01:09:42.005
<i>I just had no way out.</i>

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:47.130
<i>If you knew what I did to pay my debts.
The things I had to do...</i>

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:50.088
- They cut one of my kidneys out of me!
<i>- Can you...</i>

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:53.630
<i>That wasn't my fault.</i>

01:09:54.796 --> 01:09:57.005
<i>I didn't know that beforehand.</i>

01:09:58.421 --> 01:09:59.463
<i>I didn't know!</i>

01:10:03.755 --> 01:10:05.213
I can't believe it.

01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:13.005
<i>Yes.</i>

01:10:15.546 --> 01:10:16.505
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:10:18.588 --> 01:10:19.505
"Sorry"?

01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.463
Is that all you can come up with?

01:10:23.921 --> 01:10:24.755
"Sorry"?

01:10:28.755 --> 01:10:31.505
Why didn't you tell me?
I thought you trusted me.

01:10:34.546 --> 01:10:35.963
<i>Then you would have left me.</i>

01:10:36.588 --> 01:10:37.838
I wish that was true.

01:10:38.921 --> 01:10:40.588
<i>I wish it was different.</i>

01:10:43.005 --> 01:10:44.713
Now I'm supposed to
give my life for you?

01:10:48.130 --> 01:10:49.963
You don't know what will happen to me.

01:10:53.671 --> 01:10:54.588
<i>I...</i>

01:10:55.630 --> 01:10:56.588
<i>No.</i>

01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:03.296
Enno, listen to me.

01:11:04.255 --> 01:11:06.796
I know how to get the family fortune.

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:10.421
I can get my dad's trust funds.
You have no idea how much money that is.

01:11:10.421 --> 01:11:15.046
So much. I can get even more from Mone.
You can get it all, every cent.

01:11:15.046 --> 01:11:18.088
With this you can pay off all your debts.
I promise.

01:11:18.088 --> 01:11:20.046
But you have to get us out of here.

01:11:20.046 --> 01:11:21.088
Then I'll forgive you.

01:11:21.088 --> 01:11:23.130
If you save me.

01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:24.755
If we don't die today.

01:11:25.838 --> 01:11:28.171
<i>Babe, I already tried. That won't work.</i>

01:11:29.005 --> 01:11:31.296
You can do it.
You are stronger than you think.

01:11:31.296 --> 01:11:35.088
You can make the driver understand
how much they can get

01:11:35.088 --> 01:11:36.421
and I won't say anything.

01:11:36.421 --> 01:11:38.838
I... I won't betray anyone.

01:11:38.838 --> 01:11:40.796
<i>They'll never believe me.</i>

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:44.171
Please don't have me killed
just because I loved you.

01:11:44.171 --> 01:11:46.630
Please, I don't want to die.
Do you understand?

01:11:46.630 --> 01:11:48.713
I don't want to die.

01:11:49.713 --> 01:11:51.921
<i>Malina, they can't let you go.</i>

01:11:51.921 --> 01:11:54.338
I... I need you.

01:11:54.338 --> 01:11:57.213
<i>Handing you over is my chance to survive.</i>

01:11:57.213 --> 01:11:58.588
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:14:00.713 --> 01:14:02.713
<i>- What... What's that?</i>
- What do you think?

01:14:03.296 --> 01:14:06.796
<i>When? When? I... This can't be true.</i>

01:14:08.255 --> 01:14:12.463
<i>- That can't be true.</i>
- You won't kill only me.

01:14:12.463 --> 01:14:15.505
- But also your son.
<i>- You said it was too soon for kids.</i>

01:14:15.505 --> 01:14:19.671
Yes, and yet I was never happier
than in the moment I found out.

01:14:19.671 --> 01:14:22.380
- I thought it was a sign.
<i>- Why didn't you say anything?</i>

01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:25.130
- It just happened this way.
<i>- No. Damn it.</i>

01:14:26.046 --> 01:14:28.588
<i>You know how much I wanted children.</i>

01:14:28.588 --> 01:14:31.088
<i>- Why...</i>
- I only found out recently.

01:14:31.088 --> 01:14:32.796
I wanted to tell you once we landed.

01:14:33.963 --> 01:14:36.338
<i>Shit. This is crazy.</i>

01:14:37.505 --> 01:14:40.546
When I found out... In that moment, I...

01:14:41.588 --> 01:14:44.213
I wanted this child, badly.

01:14:45.421 --> 01:14:46.546
I thought, I...

01:14:48.505 --> 01:14:49.921
I wanted you to stay with me.

01:14:50.546 --> 01:14:52.005
That you had to stay with me.

01:14:54.421 --> 01:14:56.005
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

01:14:56.005 --> 01:14:58.796
- I told you that I can't live without you.
<i>- But...</i>

01:14:58.796 --> 01:15:00.505
<i>People say stuff like this.</i>

01:15:01.671 --> 01:15:04.171
<i>- Doesn't mean that they mean it.</i>
- I was stupid.

01:15:04.171 --> 01:15:05.755
You were very convincing.

01:15:06.421 --> 01:15:09.338
I thought I was only worth something
if you liked me.

01:15:10.088 --> 01:15:12.463
I thought so many times
that I was the problem.

01:15:12.463 --> 01:15:16.213
Every time I felt guilty without knowing
what I had done wrong.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.338
But I want this child. Still.

01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.838
Our son.

01:15:25.255 --> 01:15:28.130
Are you sure you can live
with killing your own boy?

01:19:45.171 --> 01:19:46.088
No.

01:19:46.755 --> 01:19:47.755
No.

01:19:52.546 --> 01:19:54.463
I didn't want any of this to happen, really.

01:20:22.171 --> 01:20:24.338
Hey. Hey! I...

01:21:19.505 --> 01:21:20.546
Please, please.

01:21:22.505 --> 01:21:24.296
Enno! Hey.

01:21:24.296 --> 01:21:26.630
You can't abandon me.

01:21:27.671 --> 01:21:29.796
You can't let me die alone.

01:21:31.588 --> 01:21:32.755
Say something.

01:21:32.755 --> 01:21:36.088
Anything. Please. Anything.

01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:42.838
Come on. Come on.

01:21:45.755 --> 01:21:47.338
Please come on. Say something.

01:21:47.338 --> 01:21:48.630
Say something. Say anything.

01:21:56.171 --> 01:21:57.421
Come on.

01:22:07.046 --> 01:22:08.963
Why did you do this to us?

01:22:11.005 --> 01:22:13.838
Why did you do this to us?

01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:21.755
Why did you do this to us?

01:22:40.130 --> 01:22:41.213
Time of death...

01:22:43.755 --> 01:22:45.338
4:26.

01:24:32.088 --> 01:24:34.838
Well... This is for my family.

01:24:37.005 --> 01:24:39.463
This is the last time you'll see me.

01:24:41.796 --> 01:24:43.921
I wish I could see your faces
one last time.

01:24:45.213 --> 01:24:46.171
And Mone...

01:24:47.130 --> 01:24:49.171
I would have loved to be an aunt.

01:24:49.963 --> 01:24:51.630
I think I would have liked it.

01:24:52.630 --> 01:24:53.588
I would...

01:24:55.046 --> 01:24:57.505
I would also have loved
to have a child of my own.

01:25:01.671 --> 01:25:04.713
But I made so many bad decisions lately.

01:25:06.630 --> 01:25:08.755
I was in love and weak.

01:25:11.755 --> 01:25:15.005
That was enough for me forget
who I actually am

01:25:15.005 --> 01:25:16.255
and what I'm capable of.

01:25:16.255 --> 01:25:18.796
And it's going to kill me.

01:25:21.921 --> 01:25:24.421
But I won't let them decide when and how.

01:25:25.796 --> 01:25:28.880
I should have continued then as well.
As a doctor, I mean.

01:25:29.588 --> 01:25:32.130
The Gabriel thing wasn't my fault.

01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:35.171
And everything that is happening now

01:25:35.171 --> 01:25:36.921
is not Elisa's fault.

01:25:38.046 --> 01:25:39.588
I want her to know that.

01:25:42.088 --> 01:25:43.421
I love you all.

01:26:57.130 --> 01:26:58.296
Three.

01:27:00.338 --> 01:27:01.463
Two.

01:27:04.005 --> 01:27:05.588
One!

01:27:36.546 --> 01:27:38.546
Help!

01:27:39.838 --> 01:27:41.963
Help!

01:27:48.421 --> 01:27:50.421
No, no.

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:52.921
No.

01:28:00.463 --> 01:28:02.088
No, no, no.

01:28:18.421 --> 01:28:20.296
I won't drown with you.

01:30:42.505 --> 01:30:43.630
<i>To film my tired face.</i>

01:30:43.630 --> 01:30:45.588
<i>You will cherish the memory later,
believe me.</i>

01:30:46.171 --> 01:30:47.380
<i>That's enough...</i>

01:30:48.713 --> 01:30:49.713
<i>Spoilsport!</i>

01:30:53.546 --> 01:30:54.963
<i>- What?
- One more kiss.</i>

01:31:01.963 --> 01:31:02.880
<i>I...</i>

01:31:03.796 --> 01:31:04.755
<i>love you.</i>
