00:00.201 --> 00:01.659
I didn't think you were coming.

00:03.386 --> 00:04.579
- What?
- Nothing.

00:04.659 --> 00:06.129
What the hell is that?

00:08.271 --> 00:09.232
I don't know.

00:09.459 --> 00:10.499
You okay?

00:11.248 --> 00:13.043
Gassy... Better everyday.

00:13.184 --> 00:15.248
- Could we take a break?
- Maybe a short one.

00:15.351 --> 00:17.180
This is Joanna, an old friend of mine.

00:17.349 --> 00:20.784
- How well do you know her?
- No, don't even think about it.

00:20.893 --> 00:22.161
It was that obvious, eh?

00:22.379 --> 00:24.171
Joanna and I were married for 3 years.

00:24.409 --> 00:26.415
He seems to think
that we have a lot in common.

00:26.498 --> 00:27.369
Really?

00:27.538 --> 00:28.637
I gotta go.

00:28.983 --> 00:33.516
You are gonna choose a trip to Wisconsin
over more incandescent sex with me?

00:33.605 --> 00:35.189
That was the hospital in Racine.

00:35.773 --> 00:38.734
Joanna's in quarantine there.
She's infected with CDAD.

00:38.814 --> 00:40.119
C. Difficile,

00:40.251 --> 00:43.726
just one of a whole number
of bacteria living in our intestines.

00:43.899 --> 00:46.067
Basically, your colon swells shut,

00:46.696 --> 00:48.438
eventually nothing passes through.

00:49.854 --> 00:51.527
<i>And we found where it was hiding.</i>

00:51.636 --> 00:52.775
<i>In a plant, David.</i>

00:53.014 --> 00:54.445
In the soil of a potted plant.

00:54.530 --> 00:57.790
<i>Moms. They were sold as a local
fundraiser for spina bifida research.</i>

00:58.928 --> 00:59.956

03:28.990 --> 03:31.332
I got the results back on the plants
from the greenhouse.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.476
And only the mums tested positive
for C. difficile.

03:33.556 --> 03:36.908
- Where did the mums come from?
- Can't CDC or NIH deal with this?

03:36.988 --> 03:38.957
I'm on my way
to the airport to check this out.

03:39.037 --> 03:40.765
I'd like to know
where the hell I'm going.

03:41.258 --> 03:42.288
I'll look into it.

03:49.267 --> 03:51.098
I thought you were
on your way to Michigan.

03:51.194 --> 03:52.986
- Not anymore.
- What happened?

03:53.967 --> 03:55.541
The memorial's a family affair.

03:55.832 --> 03:57.186
You're not family?

03:57.826 --> 04:00.283
Not in Joanna's parents' minds.

04:01.904 --> 04:02.908
Sorry, man.

04:05.457 --> 04:06.694
Where are you going?

04:07.496 --> 04:09.191
<i>We</i> are going to the airport.

04:11.522 --> 04:14.004
Can't you handle this on your own?

04:17.689 --> 04:20.221
Yeah, I can do this on my own.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.644
I was gonna go find out
about what killed Joanna.

04:22.724 --> 04:24.516
I just thought you might be interested.

04:28.038 --> 04:29.761
David, I've got an address.

04:40.159 --> 04:43.106
You barely knew Joanna,
why would you offer her a job?

04:45.006 --> 04:47.552
I barely knew you
when I offered you a job.

04:48.793 --> 04:51.677
True, but that's not an answer.

04:53.846 --> 04:56.041
I thought
we might have worked well together.

04:59.791 --> 05:02.048
I just didn't want to see
Joanna get hurt...

05:02.167 --> 05:03.170
again.

05:05.866 --> 05:06.869
Yeah.

05:36.179 --> 05:38.260
It's a total overreaction!

05:40.209 --> 05:43.356
I'm shipping $175 000 worth
of product tomorrow.

05:43.447 --> 05:45.937
- No, you're not, Mr. Bishop.
- We believe that the soil

05:46.017 --> 05:48.296
in your potted plants
and in your fields is contaminated.

05:48.601 --> 05:49.429
Bullshit!

05:50.349 --> 05:52.829
I'm as environmentally friendly
as you can get.

05:52.909 --> 05:54.913
No chemicals. No additives. Nothing.

05:55.139 --> 05:57.810
Alright, are you putting anything new
on your fields?

05:57.922 --> 06:00.681
- Fertilizers, bulb seedlings?
- No, nothing like that.

06:00.869 --> 06:03.489
- Are any of your employees sick?
- The usual.

06:03.652 --> 06:05.307
We're going to have to do blood tests.

06:05.634 --> 06:07.276
What about your water system?

06:07.508 --> 06:09.088
Spring-fed irrigation.

06:10.042 --> 06:12.197
Ninety percent
of the water I use goes back

06:12.278 --> 06:14.248
into the aquifer in drinkable condition.

06:14.405 --> 06:17.176
Well look, until we find out
where that bacteria's coming from,

06:17.264 --> 06:19.195
you're shutting down,
that's all there is to it.

06:19.910 --> 06:22.518
If I don't ship these
plants in 24 hours, I'm dead.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.806
And if you do, somebody else might be.

06:25.891 --> 06:28.750
This land has been in my family
for 3 generations.

06:28.928 --> 06:31.728
And suddenly
you hotshot Canadians come down here,

06:31.808 --> 06:34.702
start throwing your weight around.
What the hell is this?

06:35.940 --> 06:37.532
Actually, I'm Mexican.

06:37.620 --> 06:39.407
You mind if we borrow one of these?

06:41.538 --> 06:43.607
Will it get you out of here faster?

06:43.719 --> 06:45.271
No guarantees.

06:45.351 --> 06:46.302
Hey Rachel!

06:46.794 --> 06:48.801
Listen, I want you
to look into something for me.

06:56.251 --> 06:57.769
- Hey Bob.
- Yep?

06:58.120 --> 07:00.649
I've got some new data from Zurich
on two antibiotics,

07:00.729 --> 07:02.308
vancomycin and metromidazole.

07:02.410 --> 07:05.356
Maybe they'll be more effective on
the C. difficile than the others.

07:05.436 --> 07:07.521
I just got a call from David.
They're on the farm.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.626
He'll send back
a load of samples to be PCRed.

07:09.706 --> 07:12.824
I'll have a team ready to analyze
results as soon as you get them to me.

07:12.912 --> 07:15.484
I need to do another set
of kill curves on new antibiotics.

07:15.564 --> 07:18.011
- Is your containment room available?
- Be my guest.

07:18.410 --> 07:21.559
- Will you bring the Zurich data over?
- Yeah, I know, I've got it right here.

07:21.639 --> 07:22.922
- So?
- So what?

07:23.022 --> 07:25.107
- Milo.
- He's really nice.

07:25.187 --> 07:27.681
- Just nice?
- Gotta get these to Bob.

07:31.980 --> 07:33.385
- Hey.
- Rachel!

07:35.635 --> 07:36.939
Do you have a minute?

07:39.768 --> 07:42.047
- Could you get that for me?
- I'll get the door for you.

07:42.178 --> 07:44.679
- Wisconsin Health called.
- Oh yeah?

07:46.141 --> 07:49.181
Looks like the situation is stabilizing.
No reports of new cases.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.057
- And the plants?
- Everything that was sold

07:51.137 --> 07:53.185
has been tracked down and destroyed.

07:53.311 --> 07:55.593
- What about the greenhouse?
- Sterilized.

07:55.988 --> 07:57.918
- Good.
- Be back in a second.

07:58.213 --> 08:00.320
Let's hope David can find
the source at the farm.

08:15.966 --> 08:17.263
About us,

08:17.740 --> 08:19.107
what we're doing,

08:19.364 --> 08:21.608
- I'm a little concerned.
- Why?

08:22.210 --> 08:24.217
- If David finds out...
- I know.

08:24.436 --> 08:26.900
And I think Mayko's already suspicious.

08:27.332 --> 08:29.944
Maybe we should start
taking separate cars.

08:30.295 --> 08:32.491
Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

08:42.678 --> 08:45.946
- Will you bring the Zurich data over?
- Yeah, I know, I've got it right here.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.333
- So?
- So what?

08:50.806 --> 08:51.952
Hi Wes.

08:52.655 --> 08:53.695
Rachel!

08:56.046 --> 08:57.752
Hey, can you get that for me?

08:57.977 --> 09:00.397
- I'll get the door for you.
- Thanks.

09:01.100 --> 09:02.693
Okay, so here's the data.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.459
And we've got another batch
that's gonna be tested later tonight.

09:05.539 --> 09:08.114
Tell them to send everything
that they have and then I'll...

09:08.478 --> 09:10.700
Oh, my god! Are you okay? No, Bob!

09:10.780 --> 09:11.976
Bob, just leave it!

09:13.453 --> 09:15.434
Oh, great. Who the...?

09:15.814 --> 09:18.573
Britney...
Why would she hit the crash button?

09:18.861 --> 09:21.871
She was trained at the government labs.
They're taught to do that.

09:22.236 --> 09:23.676
Great. Now we're in lockdown.

09:23.769 --> 09:26.550
- Here, m-maybe I should...
- No, Bob, just leave it.

09:31.086 --> 09:32.753
- Ah, shit.
- What?

09:38.566 --> 09:41.751
What's Bishop thinking?
Not taking us seriously?

09:42.033 --> 09:43.776
He's thinking profit and loss.

10:01.273 --> 10:02.276
No?

10:51.039 --> 10:53.472
I've spent my entire life in labs,
since I was 13.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.258
That... has never happened before.

10:55.377 --> 10:58.179
- Don't sweat it. It's not a big deal.
- Yes, it is a big deal, Mayko.

10:58.304 --> 11:00.862
An antibiotic resistant strain
of C. difficile is killing people

11:00.963 --> 11:02.912
and because of me, we are stuck in here.

11:02.992 --> 11:04.202
It was an accident.

11:04.282 --> 11:05.302
It's okay.

11:08.447 --> 11:10.347
I'm not getting any better, Mayko.

11:11.049 --> 11:13.256
- What are you talking about?
- My eyes.

11:13.557 --> 11:14.949
There's something wrong with them.

11:17.206 --> 11:18.410
Oh God, Bob.

11:21.228 --> 11:22.756
What happened? You okay?

11:22.836 --> 11:25.027
I'm sorry. It was nothing.
I just, I got clumsy.

11:25.107 --> 11:27.899
I talked to the safety officer.
You're stuck in here for a while.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.453
It's C. difficile. It's okay
as long as you don't ingest it.

11:30.533 --> 11:32.259
It's not like we're gonna be
licking it up.

11:32.351 --> 11:34.115
We've got a strict procedure, guys.

11:34.530 --> 11:37.449
Stupid bureaucrats.
Rachel, just open the door.

11:37.529 --> 11:39.756
- I'm sorry.
- You know what, it's alright.

11:39.836 --> 11:41.769
You guys just hang tight, okay?

11:42.129 --> 11:44.378
When you do get out of there,
come meet me in my office.

11:44.475 --> 11:47.115
We've a lot of paperwork
we have to go through.

11:47.221 --> 11:49.312
It's fine. Come on, let's go sit.

12:12.025 --> 12:13.053
This is where you live?

12:13.298 --> 12:15.115
When we work this farm, yes.

12:15.217 --> 12:17.291
- Is that pump that irrigates fields?
- Yes.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.051
I'm gonna take a look around.

13:39.370 --> 13:41.010
What's he talking about?

13:41.371 --> 13:42.942
There were others who got sick.

13:43.585 --> 13:45.703
They went to the clinic
but never came back.

13:46.250 --> 13:49.426
- They died?
- Immigration watches the place.

13:51.434 --> 13:54.140
He won't go. You have to help him here.

14:27.006 --> 14:28.799
My <i>abuela</i> says, "Thank you".

14:30.404 --> 14:33.212
- And where is your <i>abuela?</i>
- Home. Mexico.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.985
So how long has
your vision been degrading?

15:37.098 --> 15:40.170
It was alright for a while.
At least right after the operation.

15:40.408 --> 15:41.850
But then it started.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.039
It was sporadic.

15:44.390 --> 15:46.597
Didn't realize how
bad it was getting or...

15:46.685 --> 15:48.303
maybe I just ignored it.

15:48.390 --> 15:49.644
What do you see?

15:49.807 --> 15:51.412
Something like tunnel vision.

15:51.528 --> 15:53.911
- I had a teacher with tunnel vision.
- Really?

15:54.292 --> 15:57.149
If you were really careful,
you could sneak out of his classroom

15:57.229 --> 15:58.864
while he was still sitting at his desk.

16:01.350 --> 16:02.654
That was cruel.

16:02.742 --> 16:04.523
I suppose.

16:05.413 --> 16:07.532
He knew you were gone.
He could hear everything.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.842
I don't want to hear, Mayko.

16:11.354 --> 16:12.382
I want to see.

16:13.162 --> 16:15.757
I know, Bob, I know. Sorry.

16:20.571 --> 16:23.217
So, how about you? Are you okay?

16:24.828 --> 16:25.844
I'm getting there.

16:26.709 --> 16:29.481
It was a bit slow at first.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.856
Oh God, I can't... I can't do it.

16:38.885 --> 16:40.606
Can't do it. I'm sorry.

16:40.686 --> 16:43.380
Just leave me... Just leave me alone!

16:55.113 --> 16:56.731
- Mayko?
- Yeah?

16:57.508 --> 16:59.866
Please don't tell anybody about my eyes.

16:59.965 --> 17:03.391
- They're gonna find out, Bob.
- I know, I just wanna tell David first.

17:03.792 --> 17:05.848
Okay. It's okay.

17:16.089 --> 17:17.844
You got any hand sanitizer?

17:19.300 --> 17:20.788
There's a pit toilet back there.

17:20.867 --> 17:23.017
I'm betting
it's the source of our C. difficile.

17:23.097 --> 17:25.345
Leaking into the ground water,
then into the river?

17:25.425 --> 17:26.990
Pumped all over the fields.

17:28.904 --> 17:30.057
How's the father?

17:30.894 --> 17:32.967
I think he might have
the same thing as Joanna,

17:33.047 --> 17:34.983
and he may be developing
toxic megacolon.

17:35.233 --> 17:38.305
Antibiotics are basically useless.
Anything you can do for him?

17:38.393 --> 17:39.954
All I can do is keep him hydrated

17:40.034 --> 17:43.295
and maybe he'll get lucky:
his immune system will fight it off.

17:43.693 --> 17:46.581
Rachel. You're gonna get
the samples by tonight, okay?

17:46.661 --> 17:49.612
So everybody works late. PCRs ASAP.

17:52.259 --> 17:54.347
Elvia, where's your mother?

17:55.125 --> 17:56.629
She died last year.

17:58.366 --> 17:59.482
Sorry to hear that.

17:59.582 --> 18:01.701
My father brought me here
so we can be happy.

18:02.655 --> 18:04.762
Well, you're going
to have to take charge, okay?

18:04.912 --> 18:07.852
I want you to make sure
your father does not get out of bed,

18:07.932 --> 18:09.869
that he gets lots and lots of rest.

18:10.832 --> 18:12.049
Will papa get better?

18:16.167 --> 18:18.161
Yeah, he will, yeah.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.017
Thank you, Dr. Serrano.

18:34.778 --> 18:37.415
We think we found
the source of your problem.

18:37.503 --> 18:40.123
Open pit latrine you set up
for your migrant workers.

18:40.399 --> 18:42.882
I didn't set up that shithole.
They did it on their own.

18:43.597 --> 18:45.770
You're telling me
that's what's screwing me up?

18:45.883 --> 18:47.538
They're living like animals out there.

18:48.930 --> 18:49.983
Listen, pal.

18:50.071 --> 18:52.441
I didn't invent California agriculture.

18:52.545 --> 18:55.414
For 100 years, migrant have been
coming here, supporting their families,

18:55.494 --> 18:57.887
- making a decent living.
- Living in squalor!

18:59.379 --> 19:01.314
I pay the highest wage in this valley!

19:01.577 --> 19:03.709
They're getting sick off their own shit!

19:03.809 --> 19:05.825
How do you sleep at night?

19:05.905 --> 19:06.969
Listen.

19:07.107 --> 19:09.101
I support an entire village in Chiapas!

19:09.515 --> 19:11.765
- What do you do for Mexico?
- What do I do for Mexico?

19:11.966 --> 19:14.916
- Hey! Take it easy!
- Don't you talk to me about Mexico.

19:14.996 --> 19:17.796
- Those people mean nothing to you.
- Calm down!

19:18.253 --> 19:20.166
Outside!

19:20.279 --> 19:21.802
Those people mean nothing to you.

19:21.965 --> 19:24.020
They're farm animals to you,
you piece of shit.

19:28.499 --> 19:30.167
You do not want to piss that guy off.

19:30.411 --> 19:32.295
He threatens me again,
I'll have the cops...

19:32.375 --> 19:34.693
One of the people who died
was his ex-wife.

19:35.315 --> 19:36.481
Alright?

19:36.669 --> 19:38.274
They were very close.

19:41.314 --> 19:42.342
Shit.

19:46.230 --> 19:47.108
I'm sorry.

20:10.301 --> 20:13.085
I don't know. I just didn't want
to be with him anymore.

20:15.391 --> 20:17.497
- And you've told him that.
- Yeah.

20:19.942 --> 20:21.359
How does that make you feel?

20:23.507 --> 20:25.200
It was a shitty thing to do.

20:26.823 --> 20:28.573
Why do you think that?

20:29.482 --> 20:31.250
Because Milo helped me.

20:31.330 --> 20:33.837
'Cause he stayed with me
when I was messed up.

20:33.917 --> 20:36.109
I mean, he got me through a lot of crap.

20:36.696 --> 20:37.887
How so?

20:38.075 --> 20:39.579
Well, I just told you, he...

20:39.693 --> 20:41.385
He stayed with me, he...

20:41.874 --> 20:42.883
And...

20:43.297 --> 20:45.487
that's how come you don't want
to be with him anymore?

20:46.009 --> 20:46.833
No.

20:48.918 --> 20:49.959
I don't know.

20:52.279 --> 20:53.959
God, I don't know. I...

20:54.492 --> 20:57.499
Fuck, I wasn't born with a road map
in my hand. I don't know how to get

20:57.579 --> 20:59.859
from A to B like everybody else.

21:00.058 --> 21:02.729
What makes you think everyone else
knows how to get from A to B?

21:02.867 --> 21:07.416
I didn't know my biological parents were
gonna be dead before I was a month old.

21:07.496 --> 21:10.002
I didn't know
I was gonna lose my leg before I was 30.

21:10.892 --> 21:13.965
And I didn't know
that I wasn't ready for a relationship.

21:15.944 --> 21:18.139
But shit just happens.

21:18.414 --> 21:20.155
You think
you had a relationship with Milo?

21:20.235 --> 21:23.028
If I did, I wasn't thinking about it.

21:24.003 --> 21:26.172
About love, you know,
anything like that.

21:26.624 --> 21:28.066
What were you thinking about?

21:30.853 --> 21:31.856
Me.

21:35.204 --> 21:37.323
That's the thing, see, I just...

21:37.573 --> 21:41.009
I used him. I used Milo like ointment on

21:41.141 --> 21:42.219
a cut.

21:44.156 --> 21:47.467
You know, I used him to make me better.
And...

21:48.030 --> 21:50.529
I just sort of took
and I didn't really...

21:50.609 --> 21:52.556
I didn't give anything back.

21:54.318 --> 21:56.073
I don't think you really believe that.

22:01.313 --> 22:03.470
Well, I gave him the only thing I had.

22:05.388 --> 22:06.730
I told him the truth.

22:11.396 --> 22:12.775
What's is this?

22:13.527 --> 22:16.324
These are fluids
to keep your father hydrated.

22:19.835 --> 22:21.352
That will make him better?

22:22.819 --> 22:23.860
I hope so.

22:46.325 --> 22:49.234
Now, I'm going to leave you
more of these bags. Okay?

22:50.074 --> 22:52.218
I'm going to have to go back
to Canada soon.

22:52.750 --> 22:54.267
So you're goin to be in charge.

22:54.463 --> 22:56.143
You're going to be his doctor, okay?

22:56.243 --> 22:57.246
Okay.

22:58.179 --> 23:00.010
It's very, very important

23:00.090 --> 23:03.041
that the doctor doesn't catch
what the patient has.

23:04.263 --> 23:07.335
You have to promise me
that you're going to wash your hands.

23:07.649 --> 23:09.835
And you're not going to touch him, Okay?

23:10.165 --> 23:11.275
I promise.

23:37.632 --> 23:40.306
- Hey Bob, come on in.
- You wanted to see me?

23:44.059 --> 23:47.373
We got a week's worth
of reports that we've gotta fill out.

23:47.484 --> 23:49.946
When there's time for that.
Why don't you have a seat?

23:57.582 --> 23:59.110
I just wanted to check in with you.

23:59.542 --> 24:00.542
About?

24:01.352 --> 24:03.535
Well, since the explosion, we really

24:03.628 --> 24:05.215
haven't had a chance to talk.

24:05.621 --> 24:06.893
I wanted to make sure

24:06.979 --> 24:08.921
- that everything was fine.
- Everything's fine.

24:09.013 --> 24:09.904
Are you sure?

24:10.068 --> 24:12.177
- Why do you ask?
- I was looking at your file.

24:13.312 --> 24:15.958
You've never had an
accident of any sort before.

24:16.168 --> 24:17.400
I'm sorry.

24:17.512 --> 24:19.095
In the last 4 months,

24:19.176 --> 24:21.932
there's been 5 minor occurrences.
Not including today.

24:24.078 --> 24:25.114
What's wrong, Bob?

24:27.742 --> 24:29.671
Everything is fine, Weston.

24:30.988 --> 24:32.446
May I go now, please?

24:36.356 --> 24:37.363
Sure.

24:40.361 --> 24:41.598
Thank you.

24:49.916 --> 24:54.051
Soil samples 18, 19, and 20 all have
the antibiotic resistant strain?

24:54.391 --> 24:58.124
From what your samples are showing,
it's basically everywhere on that farm.

24:58.223 --> 24:59.708
<i>That fits nicely with our theory.</i>

24:59.807 --> 25:01.583
They use the creek water for irrigation.

25:01.663 --> 25:03.627
It gets contaminated and sprayed
over the fields.

25:03.707 --> 25:06.402
We'll confirm that
as soon as we get those latrine samples.

25:06.491 --> 25:07.519
Thanks, Rachel.

25:16.516 --> 25:18.441
So if the water tests negative

25:20.260 --> 25:23.557
then we know that no more bacteria
is getting on the field.

25:25.141 --> 25:27.292
And then will the fields be better?

25:28.067 --> 25:31.000
No, because...
the bacteria is in the soil.

25:31.838 --> 25:34.716
But I think with time,
we can get rid of that too.

25:34.799 --> 25:38.199
This is the last one, 1-23.

25:40.307 --> 25:42.055
And then will everything be okay?

25:42.977 --> 25:45.156
You are a very positive person.

25:46.350 --> 25:47.838
Why do you say that?

25:47.970 --> 25:50.540
Because you try to always
see the good in everything.

25:50.652 --> 25:53.624
My <i>abuela</i> says: if you look for good,
good will look for you.

25:54.108 --> 25:57.126
- I like your <i>abuela.</i>
- But you don't even know her.

25:57.237 --> 25:59.324
Can you give me your phone number?

25:59.967 --> 26:01.112
You'll call me?

26:01.196 --> 26:02.509
Of course.

26:02.836 --> 26:04.172
To check on our patient.

26:04.652 --> 26:06.105
Punch in your number.

26:07.689 --> 26:08.751
We should go.

26:08.863 --> 26:11.293
Your father's probably
wondering when you'll be back.

26:12.347 --> 26:14.191
- Alright.
- Okay.

26:22.164 --> 26:25.011
There's millions of migrants
working on farms in this state.

26:25.107 --> 26:26.811
You can't turn it
around all by yourself.

26:31.112 --> 26:33.150
I've seen that little girl before.

26:34.035 --> 26:35.244
What do you mean?

26:36.474 --> 26:39.600
Everywhere you look in Mexico,
there are children just like her.

26:40.155 --> 26:44.059
That want...
that <i>deserve</i> a better life.

26:49.238 --> 26:50.981
Don't do this to yourself.

26:51.395 --> 26:54.843
You do your best to make the world
a better place. I've seen it.

26:56.934 --> 26:59.894
You keep this up, you're gonna make me
jump off the wagon, you know.

27:02.935 --> 27:03.936
Oh shit.

27:16.382 --> 27:17.542
Carlos!

27:22.231 --> 27:23.335
Okay, relax.

27:38.588 --> 27:39.608
So?

27:41.895 --> 27:43.610
Great. Thanks, Wes.

27:48.592 --> 27:50.037
Riddlemeyer intervened.

27:51.187 --> 27:53.479
No charges either side. Agreed?

28:02.092 --> 28:03.698
So what about the others?

28:03.778 --> 28:05.829
Let's just call it a night, alright?

28:07.851 --> 28:08.891
Alright.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.620
<i>I understand you had quite the night.</i>

28:19.564 --> 28:21.047
It was interesting.

28:21.215 --> 28:23.257
<i>I got the test results on the latrine.</i>

28:23.623 --> 28:24.458
And?

28:25.260 --> 28:26.323
<i>There's C. difficile there</i>

28:26.405 --> 28:28.809
- but it's just plain old C. difficile.
<i>- Oh Fuck.</i>

28:28.889 --> 28:30.306
<i>It's not antibiotic resistant?</i>

28:30.418 --> 28:31.963
Nope. That's not what's on the fields.

28:32.594 --> 28:34.468
So you're saying we
haven't found the source.

28:34.853 --> 28:38.413
You haven't found the source.
Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.

28:38.751 --> 28:39.758
Thanks.

28:40.180 --> 28:42.349
That could be good news
for Elvia and Felipe.

28:42.463 --> 28:44.079
We can start them on antibiotics.

28:44.165 --> 28:46.699
It doesn't make any sense.
What are we missing?

28:47.176 --> 28:50.062
- It's gotta be coming from somewhere!
- Elvia's not answering.

28:50.395 --> 28:53.410
Okay, help me figure this
out for a minute, alright?

28:55.041 --> 28:56.923
Well, there must be another source.

28:57.052 --> 29:00.052
Two separate outbreaks?
No, that's way too coincidental.

29:00.142 --> 29:03.731
Something happened to that bacterium
once it got onto that field.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.927
It mutated?

29:08.254 --> 29:09.399
Let's go with that.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.148
Here's our field.

29:16.500 --> 29:18.405
Here's our innocent little bacterium,

29:19.215 --> 29:20.232
fresh

29:21.002 --> 29:22.036
from the crapper.

29:22.116 --> 29:24.501
Now, how did it
become antibiotic resistant?

29:30.543 --> 29:33.300
Another bacterium on the field...

29:34.077 --> 29:36.129
with antibiotic resistant DNA.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.277
Good. So...

29:37.901 --> 29:40.066
Our two bacteria, they hook up.

29:40.177 --> 29:42.782
A couple of drinks later,
they're practicing unsafe conjugation.

29:42.871 --> 29:46.126
Or non-conjugative.
It could also be a transposable plasmid.

29:46.259 --> 29:49.492
Yeah. Point is they swap DNA.

29:49.764 --> 29:51.984
We've been asking
the wrong question the whole time.

29:53.168 --> 29:55.442
What we need to know
is what that other bacterium is.

29:56.888 --> 30:00.069
You know, I'd like to check out Felipe
and Elvia, make sure everything's okay.

30:00.526 --> 30:01.562
Go.

30:10.347 --> 30:11.365
Yeah, Bob?

30:11.564 --> 30:12.571
<i>David.</i>

30:13.857 --> 30:15.874
I need all the soil samples retested.

30:16.114 --> 30:18.043
- Retested?
- Full microbiology

30:18.133 --> 30:19.883
and DNA analysis right away.

30:20.212 --> 30:22.529
Was there a problem with
the other tests that I ran?

30:22.641 --> 30:25.277
We think another bacterium
other than the C. difficile

30:25.367 --> 30:28.139
might be carrying
the antibiotic resistant information.

30:28.229 --> 30:29.505
I need to figure out what it is.

30:30.995 --> 30:32.025
Okay.

30:32.115 --> 30:34.280
<i>- Something wrong, Bob?</i>
- I'm fine.

30:34.631 --> 30:36.355
I know you better than that. What is it?

30:36.435 --> 30:37.641
I don't want to talk about it.

30:37.721 --> 30:39.608
- What's wrong, Bob?
- Nothing.

30:39.690 --> 30:40.816
You're a terrible liar.

30:40.896 --> 30:42.896
- We gonna talk when I get back.
<i>- Alright.</i>

31:18.372 --> 31:19.542
Wes. Yeah, it's Carlos.

31:19.644 --> 31:21.709
Listen,
I need a geoposition on a phone number.

31:31.714 --> 31:33.212
Wes, I'm on the Coast Highway.

31:33.324 --> 31:36.737
- How far ahead of me are they?
- Okay, Carlos I'm tracking you now.

31:36.852 --> 31:39.978
They're about 30 kilometres ahead.
You're closing fast.

32:02.339 --> 32:04.340
- What?
- I think I found our bacteria.

32:04.452 --> 32:06.507
- Hello David.
- What are we looking at?

32:06.588 --> 32:07.695
<i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa.</i>

32:07.775 --> 32:09.974
A very common bacteria
found in soil everywhere.

32:10.061 --> 32:12.165
Seems to be carrying
a resistance marker.

32:12.461 --> 32:14.075
There's only one problem with that, Bob.

32:14.177 --> 32:16.873
It'd be almost impossible
to have it mate with the C. difficile.

32:16.953 --> 32:19.833
<i>I know it's gram negative
and C. difficile is gram positive.</i>

32:20.560 --> 32:22.407
It's the only antibiotic
resistant bacteria

32:22.487 --> 32:24.301
- you found out here?
<i>- The only one.</i>

32:24.526 --> 32:26.071
But I do have some good news.

32:26.156 --> 32:29.505
I checked for antibiotics as you asked.
The soil was saturated in Triclocarbon.

32:29.591 --> 32:32.143
<i>- The antimicrobial?</i>
- Yes. It's in everything, right?

32:32.235 --> 32:35.462
Soaps, deodorants, toothpastes,
it's even embedded in kitchen utensils,

32:35.542 --> 32:37.810
- toys, bedding, socks...
- I get it, Bob.

32:37.975 --> 32:41.100
... and the highest concentrations
were in the farm's compost piles.

32:41.180 --> 32:44.896
<i>- Where did the compost come from?</i>
- Yeah, I already have that too. It's...

32:45.481 --> 32:48.367
It came from a sewage plant
in Orange County.

32:49.162 --> 32:52.221
So let me guess. The solid matter
is separated from the waste water,

32:52.301 --> 32:54.519
turned into compost,
treated for bacteria...

32:54.654 --> 32:56.521
But not for chemicals like Triclocarbon.

32:56.609 --> 32:59.547
Great. Nice plan. All this chemical shit
gets washed down the drain,

32:59.627 --> 33:01.859
ends up on a farm field,
kills all the weak bacteria,

33:01.939 --> 33:03.248
leaving only the super strong.

33:03.382 --> 33:05.741
And the anti-microbial soaps are only
0.2% more effective

33:05.821 --> 33:08.323
at killing bacteria
than ordinary soap and water.

33:09.166 --> 33:10.387
Thanks, Bob.

33:44.196 --> 33:47.968
They've turned off at Highway 53.
That's about 6 km ahead.

34:52.956 --> 34:54.826
He's really slowed down, Carlos.

35:44.713 --> 35:45.729
Elvia.

35:53.210 --> 35:55.724
He won't wake. I kept trying.

36:14.384 --> 36:15.414
It's okay.

36:39.730 --> 36:42.641
Yes, I have to report a deceased body.

36:43.155 --> 36:45.792
Side road off the Coast Highway.

36:48.196 --> 36:49.830
It was the compost?

36:50.189 --> 36:51.196
Yeah.

36:51.711 --> 36:53.443
We think it created the...

36:53.910 --> 36:55.978
... antibiotic resistant bacteria.

36:57.247 --> 36:58.621
This is so fucked.

37:00.560 --> 37:02.472
I try to do the right thing.

37:03.618 --> 37:05.320
Use recycled compost.

37:06.574 --> 37:09.946
A hundred other farms doing
exactly the same thing. Why me?

37:10.050 --> 37:12.377
We don't know yet. We're working on it.

37:14.982 --> 37:16.101
Hand soap.

37:17.221 --> 37:18.855
Amongst other things.

37:21.068 --> 37:22.143
What now?

37:28.097 --> 37:29.322
What do I do?

37:30.599 --> 37:32.816
Flame-sterilize 300 acres?

37:33.464 --> 37:35.838
Scrape off the topsoil
and shoot it into space?

37:35.918 --> 37:37.401
I wish I had an answer for you.

37:42.210 --> 37:43.317
I'm fucked.

37:44.426 --> 37:46.337
Completely, totally fucked.

37:51.453 --> 37:52.799
Listen, you...

37:53.542 --> 37:55.423
have crop insurance?

37:57.512 --> 37:58.743
Not for this.

37:58.945 --> 37:59.985
Alright.

38:01.197 --> 38:02.205
Well...

38:03.650 --> 38:06.828
I'll talk to the EPA
and I'll put in a word for you.

38:07.482 --> 38:11.341
Maybe there's something the Feds can do,
disaster relief or something like that.

38:12.823 --> 38:13.764
I appreciate it.

38:18.616 --> 38:21.092
Just let me know
if there's anything I can do.

38:21.616 --> 38:22.714
Thanks.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.380
<i>Be almost... Be almost...
Be almost impossible.</i>

38:56.489 --> 38:59.750
<i>Pseudomonas Aeruginosa. A very common
bacteria found in soil everywhere.</i>

38:59.862 --> 39:02.797
<i>Bob, it'd be almost impossible
to have it mate with the C. difficile.</i>

39:02.909 --> 39:06.418
<i>I know it's gram negative
and C. difficile is gram positive.</i>

39:21.692 --> 39:25.338
- Electropo-what?
- Electroporation. See, the problem...

39:25.543 --> 39:28.690
was that we had 2 bacterium that
couldn't mate, but they'd swapped DNA.

39:28.955 --> 39:30.797
When I was standing in that field
I realized,

39:31.154 --> 39:32.475
for all intents and purposes,

39:32.555 --> 39:34.745
I was standing in a huge petri dish
full of bacteria.

39:34.857 --> 39:37.147
And I thought if I took
that petri dish back to the lab,

39:37.259 --> 39:39.005
how would I mutate the bacteria in it?

39:39.104 --> 39:40.976
I still don't know
what electroporation is.

39:41.088 --> 39:44.481
- Fancy way of saying lightning.
- So why doesn't he just say lightning?

39:44.615 --> 39:45.615
The point is,

39:46.056 --> 39:47.648
we use electroporation at labs

39:47.772 --> 39:50.747
to transfer genetic information
from one bacterium to another, right?

39:50.836 --> 39:54.323
Just hit the sample with 2000 volts
of electricity for a millisecond.

39:54.406 --> 39:57.560
The theory is that mother nature
is doing this all the time.

39:57.694 --> 39:59.866
The Earth is struck
by lightning 100 times per second.

39:59.978 --> 40:01.796
Teams of microbiologists
travel the world

40:01.895 --> 40:04.473
checking sites of lightning
strikes for bacterial mutations.

40:04.576 --> 40:06.928
Exactly. So, here's your field.

40:07.174 --> 40:08.431
Bolt of lightning hits it.

40:08.555 --> 40:12.099
The charge zaps a couple of bacterium.
Their cell walls break down,

40:12.233 --> 40:15.505
DNA from one leaks out
and slips into another.

40:16.081 --> 40:18.275
Instant evolution. Anything can happen.

40:18.409 --> 40:21.930
And in this case, the DNA made
the bacterium antibiotic resistant.

40:22.109 --> 40:24.012
- What are the odds?
- Infinitesimal.

40:24.169 --> 40:25.557
But hey, shit happens.

40:26.035 --> 40:28.609
There are up to 3 billion bacteria
in 1 gram of soil

40:28.708 --> 40:30.546
and 3.6 trillion lightning strikes
per year.

40:31.364 --> 40:32.393
So what do we do?

40:32.473 --> 40:35.390
We could try to get every
sewage-treatment plant in North America

40:35.470 --> 40:36.867
to screen for anti-microbials.

40:37.036 --> 40:38.785
That'll only take about 25 years.

40:38.896 --> 40:41.524
- So there's nothing we can do.
- It's pretty straightforward.

40:41.624 --> 40:43.939
We could stop using chemicals
against simple problems.

40:44.037 --> 40:45.500
Wash your hands with soap and water.

40:45.611 --> 40:49.120
And reserve antimicrobials
for clinical situations.

40:50.733 --> 40:51.746
Class dismissed.

40:52.280 --> 40:54.585
Bob. Principal's office, please.

41:01.802 --> 41:02.802
What?

41:03.905 --> 41:05.923
What? What's going on with you?

41:06.353 --> 41:07.403
Nothing.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.637
- Everything's fine.
- Really?

41:11.522 --> 41:13.179
Bob, have I ever lied to you?

41:17.977 --> 41:20.350
What happened to the fighting fish?

41:20.586 --> 41:22.709
Who ate the squeezable cheese log?

41:24.156 --> 41:27.000
Who put the underwear
in my desk drawer on my birthday?

41:27.134 --> 41:29.210
My point is you didn't like it, right?

41:34.229 --> 41:35.978
Is Wes giving you shit for something?

41:36.289 --> 41:37.502
It's not that, David.

41:37.625 --> 41:38.608
Then what?

41:47.276 --> 41:48.861
I had an accident.

41:49.986 --> 41:52.024
But before it something funny happened.

41:54.061 --> 41:55.064
Funny?

41:55.470 --> 41:56.497
With my vision.

41:57.393 --> 41:59.614
That doesn't sound very funny, Bob.

42:00.147 --> 42:02.871
No. Things went blurry.

42:03.302 --> 42:04.346
You're alright now?

42:04.784 --> 42:08.028
It's not the first time,
and now it's happening more often.

42:11.972 --> 42:13.437
I'm really scared, David.

42:14.140 --> 42:16.427
Oh, no, Bob, come on.

42:18.385 --> 42:20.841
If there's something wrong with my eyes,

42:21.534 --> 42:22.969
I can't do my job.

42:24.563 --> 42:25.712
And my job,

42:26.299 --> 42:27.408
this lab...

42:27.943 --> 42:29.443
- it's all that I have.
- Okay.

42:29.523 --> 42:30.850
Listen to me.

42:32.872 --> 42:36.450
All our years together,
have we ever been stumped by anything?

42:37.298 --> 42:40.406
Miranda Virus,
brown cloud over Mexico City.

42:40.486 --> 42:43.612
We figured out what toasted those
scientists down in Utah pretty quick.

42:45.307 --> 42:46.323
Right.

42:47.966 --> 42:50.018
We'll figure this one out too, okay?

42:55.228 --> 42:58.881
First, you see your ophthalmologist,
find out what's going on.

43:22.607 --> 43:24.958
I just want you to be sure about this.

43:26.355 --> 43:27.444
I am sure.

43:29.789 --> 43:33.684
My mother has a big house, you know,
a lot of people taking care of it.

43:34.603 --> 43:35.969
She's your family.

43:36.081 --> 43:39.126
She'd love to have you.
You know, she's lonely.

43:40.431 --> 43:41.967
My father died too.

43:43.767 --> 43:45.177
I have family.

43:48.306 --> 43:50.439
Yeah. You have a lot of family.

43:52.379 --> 43:55.558
You have your cousins,
your aunties, your uncles.

43:55.692 --> 43:57.900
And of course, your <i>abuelita</i>.

43:59.105 --> 44:00.762
I want to be with them.

44:08.797 --> 44:12.195
Is there anything that I can do for you?
Anything that you need?

44:13.028 --> 44:15.424
No. I just want to go home...

44:16.629 --> 44:17.757
To Mexico.

44:18.879 --> 44:19.886
Okay.

44:47.311 --> 44:49.035
The FBI received an anonymous call.

44:49.143 --> 44:52.123
Something about a smiley face
you might've received.

44:52.213 --> 44:53.348
Something like this?

44:54.446 --> 44:56.909
The optic nerve in both eyes
is degenerating.

44:57.021 --> 44:59.435
It's progressive and irreversible.

44:59.573 --> 45:01.259
- Okay.
- Stage 2 glaucoma.

45:01.853 --> 45:03.793
I'm going blind David, I'm sorry.

45:03.899 --> 45:06.032
Carlos Serrano,
this is Rachel's son, Craig.

45:06.166 --> 45:08.555
- Nice to meet you.
- Same.

45:09.024 --> 45:11.479
- So you're just visiting?
- Actually in transit.

45:11.656 --> 45:14.477
Algonquin Park, I'm studying
some aggressive bear behaviour up there.

45:15.874 --> 45:18.268
- Look!
- What's on your face man?

45:18.470 --> 45:19.694
Those aren't burns, are they?

45:19.807 --> 45:23.796
Smaller blisters, black in the centre,
surrounded by redness and swelling.

45:23.876 --> 45:25.338
You know what you're describing?

45:25.866 --> 45:27.885
Yeah, Anthrax.

45:28.140 --> 45:29.793
What the hell's going on up here?

45:29.873 --> 45:30.846
Terrorism?

45:31.318 --> 45:33.675
Yeah Wes, that's exactly
what we're talking.

45:33.760 --> 45:36.926
The forest.
It's a massive biological weapon.
