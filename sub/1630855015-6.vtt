WEBVTT

00:06.434 --> 00:07.644
Take one, mark.

00:10.062 --> 00:12.190
Let us know when you're ready.

00:12.899 --> 00:16.027
What this new product offers
is community.

00:16.027 --> 00:18.237
Safe, secure community,

00:18.237 --> 00:22.033
enriched with the integrated
interactions with the cherished family

00:22.033 --> 00:24.660
of Waystars movie and TV characters.

00:25.411 --> 00:30.040
I'm convinced that the Living Plus
real estate brand can bring

00:30.040 --> 00:33.001
the cruise ship experience
to dry land and provide

00:33.001 --> 00:36.423
a significant boost to the
earnings of our parks division.

00:36.423 --> 00:39.175
- I couldn't be more excited.
- Can I stop you there?

00:39.967 --> 00:44.014
Sorry,
can we maybe do just one more?

00:45.264 --> 00:48.810
The thought was just
maybe a touch more upbeat.

00:51.396 --> 00:53.106
That was the thought, was it?

00:54.107 --> 00:57.277
Just be good to get it
as good as it can be.

00:58.402 --> 01:01.072
You think we should
get it as good as it can be?

01:02.073 --> 01:06.410
Could you maybe sound more excited
when you say the word excited?

01:08.788 --> 01:10.915
OK, sorry, he's a little shiny.

01:10.915 --> 01:15.294
Angela, are you nearby?
Just a little shine. Thank you.

01:20.340 --> 01:22.385
Can you please
stop buzzing around me?

01:23.719 --> 01:25.972
God, you're fucking useless.
The lot of youse.

01:26.556 --> 01:28.849
You're as bad as my fucking idiot kids.

01:30.642 --> 01:32.979
That's bullshit.
Sorry, Ken.

01:33.395 --> 01:36.648
That's fine.
That's a Valentine's card.

01:40.487 --> 01:43.072
- Can we watch it again, actually?
- Absolutely.

01:43.907 --> 01:45.074
Good to see you, dad.

03:09.075 --> 03:11.077
SUCCESSION

03:28.762 --> 03:30.512
- Hey!
- Hey!

03:31.473 --> 03:33.640
- So?
- So, what?

03:34.808 --> 03:38.897
What, you came 3 000 kilometers
and you can't come another 20 meters?

03:41.733 --> 03:45.402
I'm just stopping
at a convenient location to refuel.

03:46.570 --> 03:48.947
And there's no reason for me
to get off the plane.

03:50.241 --> 03:51.617
Bye!

04:05.382 --> 04:06.758
Hey.

04:07.549 --> 04:09.552
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:12.305 --> 04:13.431
Tired interior?

04:15.057 --> 04:17.352
Don't criticize my jet interior.
It hurts.

04:18.310 --> 04:20.021
- So?
- Nothing, nothing.

04:21.730 --> 04:23.357
Just thought I'd check in.

04:24.441 --> 04:28.821
You know, the whole product launch
investor thing.

04:28.821 --> 04:31.031
- Living Plus.
- Yeah.

04:33.410 --> 04:36.663
- Why are you doing this bullshit?
- Well, it's on the calendar.

04:36.663 --> 04:40.709
And if we decided to cancel
the product launch,

04:40.709 --> 04:43.460
it would look like we were just minding
the shop until you came in.

04:43.460 --> 04:45.213
Well, you are, right?

04:48.048 --> 04:52.512
I don't need it.
It's fucking land cruises.

04:53.555 --> 04:54.888
Living Plus.

04:56.515 --> 04:58.642
- Living Plus...
- Yeah.

04:58.642 --> 05:00.144
No, it's land cruises.

05:00.144 --> 05:03.856
Hey, you know how shitty
and heart-breaking it is

05:03.856 --> 05:05.357
being locked up on a cruise?

05:05.357 --> 05:07.651
How about that,
but you also get to stay

05:07.651 --> 05:10.030
in the same fucking place
the whole time?

05:10.030 --> 05:12.240
I'm not gonna pursue,
so why would you announce?

05:12.240 --> 05:16.077
- Well, that's presumptuous.
- Okay. So here's my situation.

05:17.454 --> 05:20.790
The deal is going
through with velocity.

05:20.790 --> 05:23.835
And lots of it,
lots of you, I really like.

05:23.835 --> 05:26.338
But lots of it I also really hate.

05:26.338 --> 05:29.507
Lots of rooms I never
want to go into, okay?

05:30.300 --> 05:37.599
So if there's someone
on the inside who understands all that,

05:37.599 --> 05:43.896
but also gets me,
that could be of value.

05:50.402 --> 05:52.488
We're buddies. Can we just talk?

05:52.488 --> 05:54.616
No, maybe I hate you.

05:54.616 --> 05:56.992
You can't hate me.
You don't know me well enough.

05:56.992 --> 05:59.287
Maybe I love my brothers very much.

06:03.083 --> 06:06.920
By the way, did they mention that
they went totally fucking mental on me

06:06.920 --> 06:08.253
up above Andalsnes?

06:10.131 --> 06:12.758
Totally unprofessional, totally dumb.

06:13.385 --> 06:15.720
Look, you spoke, I listened,

06:15.720 --> 06:20.600
but I gotta go now. I think my...
My flight's leaving.

06:21.309 --> 06:23.269
Yeah. Start the engines.

06:23.269 --> 06:25.020
Well, you keep me looped.

06:26.356 --> 06:30.275
- My girl on the inside.
- Fuck you, my boy on the outside.

06:30.275 --> 06:33.113
You know, I'm gonna tell
my brothers everything you said.

06:33.113 --> 06:36.950
Cool. Do that. Nothing to hide,
nothing I wouldn't tell them myself.

06:39.284 --> 06:41.329
- Enjoy LA.
- Bye.

07:08.523 --> 07:10.357
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, morning.

07:10.357 --> 07:13.737
Thanks to everybody
for finding time.

07:13.737 --> 07:20.035
Our CEOs wanted to give us
a sensitive, in-person update

07:20.035 --> 07:21.786
on negotiations, correct?

07:21.786 --> 07:23.996
Correct. Yeah, thanks
for being here, guys.

07:23.996 --> 07:27.334
I know everybody's swamped
with investor day

07:27.334 --> 07:29.001
and we've got the product launch.

07:29.001 --> 07:31.670
So I'll make this brief, but...

07:34.049 --> 07:35.466
I'm sorry, Shiv.

07:37.676 --> 07:42.306
Overall, very excited.

07:42.306 --> 07:44.142
Super excited.

07:44.142 --> 07:46.518
Just questions

07:46.518 --> 07:51.274
about Matsson's full understanding
of the whole business.

07:51.607 --> 07:56.820
We're pleased with the offer
we extracted. The price is great.

07:56.820 --> 07:58.906
I mean, you knocked it out
of the park, guys.

07:58.906 --> 08:01.701
- Thanks.
- Hear, hear.

08:01.701 --> 08:05.245
As we're preparing
our board recommendation,

08:05.245 --> 08:10.210
we wanted to share some confidential
context with this senior group.

08:11.461 --> 08:14.880
Long story short,
Matsson exhibited some,

08:15.423 --> 08:18.801
what you'd call, erratic behavior
that made us concerned.

08:19.678 --> 08:22.054
Well, what exactly happened?

08:22.638 --> 08:25.725
We were pushing him gently
on what we wanted,

08:25.725 --> 08:29.353
how much, and then he fucking...
How would you describe it?

08:29.353 --> 08:32.983
I would describe it as a meltdown,
human Chernobyl.

08:32.983 --> 08:35.193
But, like, specifically...

08:35.193 --> 08:38.487
Specifically, he was, like, shouting
about how, you know,

08:38.487 --> 08:40.114
we didn't know
what a good deal was

08:40.114 --> 08:43.076
and how he didn't even especially
want the deal.

08:43.076 --> 08:44.410
He didn't want the deal?

08:44.410 --> 08:46.954
Yeah, like his senior
leadership team liked it,

08:46.954 --> 08:49.498
but, you know, we better take
what was on the table.

08:49.498 --> 08:52.377
But that smells like a negotiating
tactic to me,

08:52.377 --> 08:53.837
'cause he made the offer.

08:53.837 --> 08:56.965
Maybe. It wasn't really coherent.
He was sort of, like, saying

08:56.965 --> 09:00.051
that he was stringing us along
and that he could pull the deal.

09:00.051 --> 09:02.594
So, what are you suggesting?

09:02.594 --> 09:09.060
Can we recommend a deal
with a person of this character,

09:10.353 --> 09:12.271
given everything else and so on?

09:12.271 --> 09:16.400
Tweets, drug rumors,
50% in stock.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.736
That means we are exposed.

09:20.905 --> 09:24.326
Shall I go? Okay. It's a worry.

09:25.327 --> 09:28.162
It's a concern. I think
we should monitor it closely.

09:28.954 --> 09:32.417
I don't think it hurts.
I mean, he's a genius.

09:32.417 --> 09:34.376
Nobody minds a genius acting weird.

09:34.376 --> 09:37.339
Honestly, it probably kind
of adds to the mystique.

09:37.339 --> 09:41.675
And we know that his bank and legal
team are right now progressing

09:41.675 --> 09:45.680
in a very professional manner.
What's the worry?

09:45.680 --> 09:48.098
- His reputation is priced in.
- Absolutely.

09:48.098 --> 09:50.309
Good. Yeah, okay. We feel covered.

09:50.309 --> 09:55.357
Just letting you guys know
and we should move ahead.

09:55.357 --> 09:58.735
- Thank you for keeping us informed.
- Thanks, guys.

09:58.735 --> 10:00.153
Thanks, Frank.

10:00.904 --> 10:03.447
Big day tomorrow.
Big product launch.

10:07.659 --> 10:09.037
Hi.

10:10.705 --> 10:14.917
Sorry. We didn't mention.
We were hoping to keep things dry.

10:14.917 --> 10:17.544
Yeah?

10:18.045 --> 10:19.254
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:19.254 --> 10:23.635
I think vanity stopped us.
Maybe we were proud of the deal

10:23.635 --> 10:25.303
from raising it earlier, so...

10:25.303 --> 10:27.721
Yeah. Sure.

10:32.852 --> 10:35.063
- What?
- I know you.

10:36.398 --> 10:38.233
- What?
- I fucking know you.

10:38.233 --> 10:39.651
- What?
- What?

10:39.651 --> 10:41.652
- Yeah, what?
- What?

10:42.319 --> 10:46.950
Fucking hell. Boys, you're not good
at this. Hey, Dad?

10:46.950 --> 10:50.078
Shiv spilled chocolate milk
in the Range Rover.

10:51.913 --> 10:54.874
Yeah?
You're trying to fuck the deal.

10:54.874 --> 10:57.627
No. We're not.
We're not trying to fuck the deal.

10:57.627 --> 11:00.295
But you failed to mention
this very fucking interesting incident,

11:00.295 --> 11:01.463
even as a bit of gossip?

11:01.463 --> 11:02.716
Shiv...

11:04.384 --> 11:06.219
- Yeah?
- No.

11:07.262 --> 11:08.762
No? I'm wrong?

11:10.180 --> 11:12.933
Go on. Lie to me. Lie to my face.

11:16.311 --> 11:17.981
We're not sure about the deal.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.899
Thanks, Fuckface. Excellent.

11:20.275 --> 11:23.652
Great. Throw me under
the fucking... Great. Nice.

11:23.652 --> 11:28.283
Shiv, the plan was to tell you.
Honestly, we were protecting you.

11:28.283 --> 11:31.619
Thanks so much. Yeah, don't get
mud on my confirmation dress.

11:31.619 --> 11:33.245
Thanks so fucking much.

11:33.245 --> 11:36.373
Well, it did go nuts on the mountain,
Shiv. He was talking shit about Dad.

11:36.373 --> 11:39.336
The plan was always we were getting
out, clean,

11:39.336 --> 11:43.547
doing Pierce, buying Pierce together.
What the fuck happened?

11:43.547 --> 11:47.509
Shiv, maybe we can keep it
and Pierce,

11:48.761 --> 11:50.055
all of us.

11:50.055 --> 11:52.390
Man, you are fucking cocksuckers.

11:55.101 --> 11:59.355
Shiv, we're... I'm sorry.
I mean, we're sorry. We are.

12:00.105 --> 12:04.110
We wouldn't have dicked you over.
We wanted to keep you clean.

12:04.110 --> 12:08.989
Should we like...
Can we do the huggy thing?

12:10.325 --> 12:11.575
- Sure.
- Yeah?

12:11.575 --> 12:13.035
Yeah.

12:13.786 --> 12:15.163
I am sorry.

12:17.499 --> 12:18.958
Sorry.

12:19.376 --> 12:22.044
Cool? Sorry.

12:24.673 --> 12:28.175
I have an appointment
that I can't reschedule, so...

12:30.761 --> 12:32.179
Okay, sure.

12:32.179 --> 12:36.184
- You're in here.
- We all set?

12:36.184 --> 12:40.396
I think so.
Invested relations in 20?

12:40.396 --> 12:42.106
Yeah. Thanks.

12:56.997 --> 13:00.792
I want to give you a little preview
of tonight's selection.

13:00.792 --> 13:04.002
- Hey, hey.
- Sorry.

13:04.546 --> 13:05.755
You okay?

13:05.755 --> 13:09.967
I'm fine. We had this room booked.

13:09.967 --> 13:14.138
Okay, right. I'll leave you to it.
I thought the room was empty for...

13:16.850 --> 13:19.060
- You're really okay?
- Yeah, fine.

13:20.269 --> 13:21.478
Sure?

13:24.649 --> 13:27.443
Yes. I'm just very busy.

13:28.528 --> 13:33.783
And I have found I am too busy,
what with my dad.

13:36.076 --> 13:40.998
And so Sarah has sometimes
found me somewhere

13:41.665 --> 13:44.586
so that I can have a moment to cry.

13:47.254 --> 13:50.216
- Yeah.
- You're scheduling your grief?

13:51.550 --> 13:53.761
Just fuck off, yeah?

13:57.139 --> 14:00.309
Come on. Shiv.

14:02.437 --> 14:03.562
Come on.

14:05.522 --> 14:07.150
Come on.

14:07.858 --> 14:09.943
It's okay. It's okay.

14:11.111 --> 14:14.449
It's okay.

14:37.596 --> 14:40.933
Sadly, my sons Kendall
and Roman Roy are too tied up

14:40.933 --> 14:44.562
with important company business to join
us at this year's investment day.

14:44.562 --> 14:46.855
We're not gonna keep that in?
Let's keep that in.

14:46.855 --> 14:49.817
Does it feel cheesy to alternate or
should we do block one, block two?

14:49.817 --> 14:51.945
No, it's fine. It's whatever.

14:51.945 --> 14:54.655
What do you think on a...
Thank you.

14:55.531 --> 14:59.911
What do you think on Mattson
if Operation Fruit Loop doesn't fly?

14:59.911 --> 15:04.374
Muster a share block. Board,
convince he's a value destroyer.

15:05.332 --> 15:09.212
Regulatory shit. Hope the price
runs away. I don't know. Something.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.756
Tellis says he doesn't have juice
past 192.

15:14.009 --> 15:18.179
Well, something about this
all does depress me.

15:18.179 --> 15:21.057
Do you think it's the speech
written specifically

15:21.057 --> 15:23.058
for our late father
or the fact we're planning

15:23.058 --> 15:24.978
to warehouse the elderly
and keep them

15:24.978 --> 15:27.439
drunk on content
while we suck them dollar dry?

15:27.439 --> 15:28.939
I think it's the '90s pitch.

15:28.939 --> 15:33.028
Personalized longevity programs.
What is that?

15:34.738 --> 15:35.988
Is that something?

15:38.449 --> 15:40.076
- Can we see drafts, J?
- Yeah.

15:40.076 --> 15:41.702
Give me the double click
on longevity

15:41.702 --> 15:43.662
so I can see everything.
Infinite brain box.

15:44.622 --> 15:48.333
I can ask Joy Palmer if the fucking
Kalispitron director

15:48.333 --> 15:50.879
can come on board and make
everything more confusing and loud.

15:50.879 --> 15:53.089
- Is that now, Joy?
- Yeah, that's now.

15:53.089 --> 15:55.467
Alright, sprinkle some sugar.
Full of confidence.

15:55.467 --> 15:57.260
Gotta up our velocity, man.

15:57.260 --> 16:00.305
Even she should be able to come up
with a mega hit

16:00.305 --> 16:02.223
from a couple extra content bill.

16:02.223 --> 16:05.142
Just break the log jam.
Get the franchise pump-pumping.

16:05.142 --> 16:09.063
Yeah, fuck yeah. I'm gonna
love bomb that stuck-up bitch.

16:09.063 --> 16:10.815
- Shoot it to the moon, Rome.
- Will do.

16:10.815 --> 16:12.358
New space cowboys in town.

16:13.193 --> 16:14.903
Who wants to fuck?
I'm ready to fuck.

16:15.486 --> 16:17.322
Who ready for Fuckywood?

16:37.967 --> 16:39.260
Hello.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.221
- Roman Roy.
- 'Tis I.

16:41.679 --> 16:44.139
- Hey.
- How are you? Good to see you.

16:44.139 --> 16:47.017
We'd all like to offer
our sincere condolences.

16:47.017 --> 16:50.229
Thank you. That's very nice. Refused.

16:50.229 --> 16:53.649
I have all the condolences I need.
Tummy full. Shall we?

16:53.649 --> 16:55.359
Well, it just hasn't hit you yet.

16:55.359 --> 16:58.487
I'm sure it will, but you'll be okay.
It takes time.

16:58.487 --> 17:02.325
Okay. Well, many, many thanks.
Many, many, many, many, many.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.618
You'll be fine.

17:03.618 --> 17:07.247
And it's very exciting about the deal.
What's he like?

17:07.871 --> 17:12.377
Lukas? Great. Flakey.
Really druggy.

17:12.377 --> 17:13.836
Odd. Not focused.

17:15.380 --> 17:18.466
Honestly, few issues.
I'm sure I can fix it.

17:19.091 --> 17:21.469
So I can't stand still.
I have thoughts.

17:21.886 --> 17:24.388
Well, of course. Everybody does.

17:25.597 --> 17:27.933
- What was that?
- Little Groucho Marx.

17:27.933 --> 17:30.811
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Inside cinema.

17:30.811 --> 17:34.232
So I just sort of wanted
to just get it out of the way.

17:34.232 --> 17:37.527
Kalispitron? I just want to know
who's getting fired for that shit show.

17:37.527 --> 17:41.196
I mean, I can certainly loop you in,
but it's complicated.

17:42.699 --> 17:45.117
Shall we just sidebar that?

17:45.117 --> 17:48.121
That particular situation has lots
of big personalities.

17:48.121 --> 17:50.707
Big personalities.
I can't see that happening again.

17:51.457 --> 17:53.292
No, I've been taking it very seriously.

17:53.292 --> 17:58.590
Good. Okay. Well, look, I'm going to
turn on the money hose for you, okay?

17:58.590 --> 18:00.467
We want to back you.
We just want to hear

18:00.467 --> 18:02.802
that you're confident that we can
get the hit machine pumping.

18:02.802 --> 18:08.140
Absolutely. I mean, there is one thing
that we have been concerned about.

18:08.140 --> 18:11.144
Okay. Hit me. I'm ready. Let's do it.

18:11.144 --> 18:13.980
The rightward lean from ATN.

18:14.522 --> 18:19.318
Lots of people are concerned
about Democratic institutions.

18:19.318 --> 18:22.196
Yeah. Got it.

18:26.075 --> 18:27.577
Well, you want me to say more things.

18:27.577 --> 18:31.956
We're getting a lot of questions about
ATN's favorable coverage on Mencken.

18:32.540 --> 18:34.793
Isn't there something
you can do to signal a distance?

18:34.793 --> 18:39.839
Mencken's IP, just like anything.
I don't like him. You don't like him.

18:39.839 --> 18:46.470
But it's all in terms of talent. The
company, we have values here.

18:46.805 --> 18:49.348
I get it.
And I love the values.

18:50.225 --> 18:53.353
It's an incredibly evolved,
ruthlessly segregated city

18:53.353 --> 18:55.438
you built on this geological fault here.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.273
- Let's get real.
- Look, we're trying.

18:57.273 --> 19:01.611
I feel like you're not really
listening to me.

19:01.611 --> 19:05.197
I'm saying I'm going to just
dump a ton of money on you.

19:05.197 --> 19:09.827
And all we want
is to get the hit pump pumping.

19:09.827 --> 19:11.079
You understand, right?

19:11.079 --> 19:14.081
Balance between streaming, theatrical,
franchise creation,

19:14.081 --> 19:16.375
international marketing. Yeah?

19:16.375 --> 19:19.087
Yeah. You can trust me. I got it.
Very exciting.

19:21.839 --> 19:23.215
All right.

19:24.342 --> 19:28.345
You know, Joy, I get it.

19:28.679 --> 19:31.975
You're thinking, "What the fuck does
this guy know about anything?"

19:31.975 --> 19:35.103
"He's not his dad. He can't do it.
Roman's track record is bullshit."

19:35.103 --> 19:37.939
I'm sure you are where you are
for a very good reason.

19:40.399 --> 19:42.402
I could just fire you.

19:46.823 --> 19:49.450
That's a funny joke? I could.

19:49.450 --> 19:53.162
I'm not saying I am.
I'm just saying I could.

19:53.496 --> 19:55.039
Although maybe I should.

19:55.039 --> 19:59.376
Oh no, I said it!
Now I feel like I got to commit.

19:59.376 --> 20:02.337
Our tent pole is bullshit and out of
control and you're not going to fix it.

20:02.337 --> 20:04.339
So I'm calling it.
I'm sorry. We're done.

20:04.339 --> 20:06.508
- Are you...
- Yeah, I am.

20:06.885 --> 20:10.972
What I mean to say is the company
wishes to terminate your employment.

20:11.388 --> 20:16.436
HR will be in touch to start
the termination process.

20:16.436 --> 20:19.898
We wish you the best of luck
on all your future endeavors.

20:22.149 --> 20:23.777
This is a mistake.

20:23.777 --> 20:25.070
Okay.

20:25.070 --> 20:30.533
Hey, Jade.
Let's get Lana and Hugo

20:30.533 --> 20:32.369
on analyst double check,
who's confirmed.

20:32.369 --> 20:34.620
And let's get Raj prime
to throw some softballs.

20:34.620 --> 20:40.251
And I think Shiv can just say
this and this and maybe this.

20:40.251 --> 20:43.630
Give that to Roman.
Just let him know. Okay?

20:43.630 --> 20:45.506
Yeah, I can let them know.

20:45.506 --> 20:50.136
And in terms of lighting cues, just
so we can brief Kush and the AV team,

20:50.136 --> 20:52.931
what are you thinking, Ken?

20:57.102 --> 20:59.603
Could we build me a Living Plus house?

21:01.356 --> 21:02.899
As in?

21:04.108 --> 21:05.401
Small.

21:06.027 --> 21:08.779
Plywood. Basic brickwork.
Nothing crazy.

21:08.779 --> 21:12.908
I could walk through it.
ATN on here.

21:12.908 --> 21:14.828
Face aging on the wall here.

21:18.872 --> 21:22.543
Maybe clouds appear above the house.
What do you think?

21:22.543 --> 21:24.838
We can definitely check
with the team. Denny?

21:25.671 --> 21:28.507
It's certainly an exciting vision, but...

21:28.507 --> 21:31.427
Don't say no, Denny.
Don't say no.

21:32.219 --> 21:35.432
- This is for tomorrow?
- Hollywood though, right?

21:36.016 --> 21:37.433
We need a house. Practical build.

21:37.433 --> 21:40.561
Here's the rule. Okay?
No one can say no.

21:41.854 --> 21:44.982
Yes, Kendall. Thank you,
Kendall. For the cool new rule.

21:44.982 --> 21:48.652
Thank you, Kendall.
For the cool new rule.

21:49.153 --> 21:50.988
Hey! Good pep talk?

21:52.699 --> 21:56.536
Yeah. Good. Good. Full of joy.
I kind of turned into a... whatever.

21:56.536 --> 21:58.204
I'll catch you up in a bit.

21:58.204 --> 22:00.080
I've been looking through
the launch deck.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.499
I have a big thought.

22:23.938 --> 22:26.316
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Thank you.

22:35.492 --> 22:37.535
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:37.535 --> 22:41.956
Enjoying the investor reception?
Sorry, I don't want to cramp your style.

22:41.956 --> 22:43.332
No, no.

22:43.332 --> 22:45.459
I'm sure you're keen to get amongst it.

22:45.459 --> 22:46.752
- It?
- Yeah.

22:46.752 --> 22:50.840
The vaginas of the cheerful women
who aren't tall enough to be models.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.219
Nah, I'm good.

22:54.219 --> 22:59.807
Okay.
So who do you like?

23:00.141 --> 23:02.893
Yeah? Can I guess?

23:05.647 --> 23:06.731
Could do.

23:07.147 --> 23:09.483
Is that what you've been doing?
Going around

23:09.942 --> 23:12.153
and just like saying things to people?

23:12.153 --> 23:16.198
The leggy blondes? The tan models?

23:16.198 --> 23:19.827
Like leaning in, saying hi?
"Hey, I'm Tom."

23:21.329 --> 23:25.166
If I was going to say something
from the heart,

23:25.833 --> 23:28.961
I would say I'm sorry.

23:28.961 --> 23:31.630
- You're sorry?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

23:31.630 --> 23:35.050
Sorry for fucking you up.

23:45.728 --> 23:49.441
You should be so lucky.
You hardly scratched the surface.

23:50.691 --> 23:53.235
I was fucked up long before I met you.

23:54.654 --> 23:56.113
What, with TK?

23:56.698 --> 23:58.783
Yeah. Yeah, with TK.

23:59.951 --> 24:01.745
Washington situation.

24:01.745 --> 24:05.415
You were the one after the one.
The actual one.

24:05.415 --> 24:07.459
And that's always hard.

24:07.459 --> 24:10.378
- I think I got my chisel in on you.
- Hardly a scratch.

24:12.464 --> 24:15.966
But you, I mean, I don't know
the whole story for you.

24:15.966 --> 24:19.387
- I just twisted your heart right up.
- Yeah, I guess.

24:20.805 --> 24:21.848
Mary.

24:21.848 --> 24:25.809
Mary? Tom, please.
I did a number on you. Mary?

24:25.809 --> 24:29.022
You didn't have a taste
of the dark meat before you met me.

24:29.022 --> 24:31.273
No, I'd had my times.

24:39.114 --> 24:40.949
You want to play bitey?

24:40.949 --> 24:43.411
- Bitey?
- We never played bitey?

24:43.411 --> 24:44.536
No.

24:46.372 --> 24:50.919
Okay. Well, you bite me,
I bite you. See who can take it.

24:50.919 --> 24:53.170
- Okay, sure.
- Give me your arm.

24:59.134 --> 25:02.389
So, first one to stop, loses.

25:04.139 --> 25:06.601
- Bitey.
- Bitey.

25:06.601 --> 25:08.894
- Ready?
- Yeah, I guess.

25:17.362 --> 25:18.987
Is that all you got?

25:21.157 --> 25:23.450
- Motherfucker!
- Bitey.

25:24.577 --> 25:25.954
- You okay?
- Yeah.

25:25.954 --> 25:29.123
Tom Wambsgans
finally made me feel something.

25:30.457 --> 25:31.710
Nice.

25:34.378 --> 25:37.047
So, I've been through the material
and I have a pitch.

25:38.841 --> 25:43.762
Unbelievable growth.
Price rocket.

25:44.222 --> 25:46.432
Drive the price,
we make the deal impossible.

25:46.432 --> 25:48.976
So all you need
is unbelievable growth.

25:48.976 --> 25:52.022
All right, Dr. Sarcasm,
did we ask you to squeak?

25:52.022 --> 25:53.397
Stand easy there, pitch wall.

25:53.397 --> 25:56.735
If we can drive above 192,
no one thinks Matsson has the juice.

25:56.735 --> 26:00.237
- Okay, so he has to walk.
- Chase him out on price?

26:00.237 --> 26:04.616
I think we can get a tech valuation
for a real estate proposition on this.

26:05.243 --> 26:06.660
Living Plus?

26:08.163 --> 26:11.707
Can I just say, I think it's hard

26:11.707 --> 26:15.420
to make houses seem like tech,
because we've had houses for a while.

26:15.420 --> 26:18.256
Just we need to make analysts
look at the company differently.

26:18.256 --> 26:20.592
I'm telling you,
this is the killer app.

26:20.592 --> 26:23.762
Maximize your physical potential. Live...

26:23.762 --> 26:27.014
- Well, not forever.
- Why not forever?

26:27.014 --> 26:32.062
Well, sure. If not forever,
live more forever.

26:32.478 --> 26:34.522
Pitchbot, is it dope?

26:36.106 --> 26:37.524
It's kind of dope.

26:37.524 --> 26:40.277
Like a robot, please, Pitchbot.

26:40.779 --> 26:42.905
It's kind of dope.

26:43.489 --> 26:46.825
- Oh my God, you're fired.
- We can push this to the moon.

26:46.825 --> 26:48.410
But we don't have the numbers, right?

26:48.410 --> 26:51.164
- These are the old numbers.
- We'll have the numbers.

26:51.164 --> 26:52.916
So then, where's our go-to?

26:52.916 --> 26:56.169
I guess the sweet spot would be right
after they get fucking delicious,

26:56.169 --> 26:57.921
and just before they get fucking stupid.

26:57.921 --> 27:03.008
Great. Go find Jess and what
we talked about, getting the edit.

27:03.008 --> 27:05.678
- Robot out!
- Beat it, scrub.

27:07.555 --> 27:13.103
You know, I like it. I mean,
I'm not crazy myself about dying.

27:13.103 --> 27:14.728
I know, right? It's bullshit.

27:14.728 --> 27:19.067
It was kind of not...
There was very... You know.

27:20.693 --> 27:23.654
I just didn't see it coming with Dad.

27:25.031 --> 27:28.325
- Yeah. It's very un-dad.
- Very un-dad.

27:28.325 --> 27:30.453
So I think people would
be very intrigued

27:30.453 --> 27:33.038
if there was another way through
the whole situation.

27:33.038 --> 27:35.874
- You mean life?
- Life.

27:35.874 --> 27:37.209
Death, yeah.

27:37.209 --> 27:41.715
I mean get loaded onto a chip
and fired up someone's ass.

27:42.089 --> 27:44.466
Float around as a gas,
live in a tortoise. I don't know.

27:44.466 --> 27:48.013
There's gotta be ways through.
Death feels very one-size-fits-all.

27:48.013 --> 27:50.015
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:51.099 --> 27:52.183
- Roman?
- Yeah?

27:52.183 --> 27:54.561
- I wanna talk to you.
- I wanna... Okay.

27:57.147 --> 27:58.440
The fuck is that?

27:59.149 --> 28:01.900
- I'm on a schedule, so what is this?
- What happened?

28:01.900 --> 28:03.235
- With what?
- With Joy.

28:03.235 --> 28:06.113
She's not picking up.
She's got outside counsel.

28:06.113 --> 28:08.949
- What the fuck happened?
- I fired her. So?

28:08.949 --> 28:11.869
You cannot fire a studio executive
without speaking to legal

28:11.869 --> 28:15.456
and HR and having someone
else present.

28:15.456 --> 28:18.375
Right, right.
Except I can because I did.

28:18.375 --> 28:19.753
What precisely did you say?

28:19.753 --> 28:22.922
Because now we are open
to litigation and ridicule

28:22.922 --> 28:25.382
and now we have to think
of how to frame an apology.

28:25.382 --> 28:27.093
Fucking Christ. I didn't fire her, okay?

28:27.093 --> 28:29.511
I said that she was fired to her.
That's all.

28:29.971 --> 28:31.347
What the fuck does that mean?

28:31.347 --> 28:33.558
It means she's not gonna be on
the fucking street, okay?

28:33.558 --> 28:35.143
We'll kick her up to International.

28:35.143 --> 28:38.687
Or she walks and takes
a fat fucking producer deal.

28:38.687 --> 28:40.272
You can work on the sweep up, okay?

28:40.272 --> 28:43.818
Joy has a lot of relationships.
She has a lot of friends.

28:43.818 --> 28:46.987
And you are a weak monarch
in a dangerous interregnum.

28:46.987 --> 28:48.906
And I think you need to reconsider.

28:48.906 --> 28:51.200
This is something that Dad
would have done and you know it.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.370
Well, maybe.
But you're not your dad.

28:54.996 --> 28:58.499
Okay.

28:58.499 --> 29:00.960
- You're in a more complicated position.
- I'm what's left.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.837
- Gerri, here's the fucking thing.
- What?

29:02.837 --> 29:06.174
You hauling me out of things, telling
me to reconsider good calls

29:06.174 --> 29:10.177
and using the F word freely,
it feels disrespectful.

29:10.177 --> 29:16.101
I need you to believe that I am
as good as my dad. Can you do that?

29:19.395 --> 29:20.688
Can you do that?

29:26.151 --> 29:27.653
Say it or believe it?

29:29.279 --> 29:32.993
You don't treat me with sufficient
respect and that's a problem.

29:35.412 --> 29:38.498
- Well, maybe I'll fire you too.
- Sure. I'm not on the kill list.

29:38.498 --> 29:40.499
- So?
- So, Matsson will be very angry.

29:40.499 --> 29:44.004
- Fuck Matsson. I don't care.
- Be serious. You're minding shop.

29:45.755 --> 29:48.925
Roman.
No, no, no, Roman.

29:48.925 --> 29:51.344
You cannot win against the money.

29:51.344 --> 29:54.139
The money is going
to wash you away. Your dad knew.

29:54.139 --> 29:57.267
Tech is coming. We are over.
Make your accommodation.

29:57.267 --> 30:00.186
This is a simple business decision.
You are not good at your job.

30:00.186 --> 30:01.438
Maybe Dad did know.

30:01.438 --> 30:03.355
Maybe I'm firing you for a list
of failures I choose

30:03.355 --> 30:06.943
not to outline right now, but including
a failure to close off our liabilities,

30:06.943 --> 30:09.988
vis-a-vis claims against
Waystar Cruises in a timely manner.

30:09.988 --> 30:11.989
That'll play nicely.
Let's do that.

30:11.989 --> 30:13.199
I am good at my job.

30:13.199 --> 30:14.784
Shall we get started on the paperwork?

30:14.784 --> 30:18.413
You want to do it yourself or do you
want me to get somebody a bit sharper?

30:18.413 --> 30:19.788
Bye.

30:20.415 --> 30:22.250
You fucking asshole!

30:24.878 --> 30:27.337
I think we can push. Push it.

30:28.089 --> 30:31.759
Hey, this is juicy as fuck, Roman.
We're going to work through the night.

30:32.634 --> 30:34.804
Are you okay to show face
at the reception?

30:34.804 --> 30:36.221
The party? Sure.

30:36.221 --> 30:38.098
After the thing,
because I got the big eye on.

30:38.516 --> 30:42.019
The ball is looking fat, bro.
I can see everything.

30:42.019 --> 30:43.812
Good. Good. Good.

30:43.812 --> 30:49.944
So, I think you should know...
I think we should let Joy go.

30:52.154 --> 30:54.281
- Okay. Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:55.659 --> 30:57.535
Right now it's kind of all about
the moves,

30:57.535 --> 30:59.829
so, dude, that's baller for me.

30:59.829 --> 31:01.038
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:01.373 --> 31:03.332
Let's put an end to Joy.
Death to Joy.

31:03.332 --> 31:06.460
Gerri told me that was a bad move
and I should roll that back.

31:06.460 --> 31:09.129
- So I fired Gerri.
- Fuck off.

31:09.129 --> 31:11.508
You fired Gerri?
Shiv's godmother Gerri?

31:11.508 --> 31:14.093
Yeah, but we may need
to roll back on that.

31:14.093 --> 31:16.554
You may need to smooth over, whatever.

31:19.432 --> 31:21.642
Fuck it, bro! Why not?

31:22.519 --> 31:26.063
Drop her in the end zone.
I mean, look at you.

31:28.399 --> 31:30.068
Who are you going to fire next?

31:30.402 --> 31:33.697
Fire Frank, fire Karl, fucking eat
Greg, and fire me, man.

31:33.697 --> 31:35.197
- You're on fire.
- It feels big.

31:35.197 --> 31:39.868
Put on the dad goggles, right?
It's nothing. Nothing.

31:39.868 --> 31:43.205
Dynamic Waystar duo shake up their
senior leadership team, grumble quote,

31:43.205 --> 31:44.540
grumble quote, caveat.

31:44.540 --> 31:48.460
Some are saying these two young turks
might just have what it takes

31:48.460 --> 31:49.879
to turn things around.

31:55.467 --> 31:57.094
Nice?

31:59.222 --> 32:02.057
- Nice.
- Very nice.

32:05.185 --> 32:07.939
What do you think
about the election party?

32:07.939 --> 32:10.816
Your dad's party?
You think maybe I should host?

32:14.319 --> 32:16.321
Who's that?
Striking Viking?

32:18.241 --> 32:20.284
Yeah.

32:23.455 --> 32:25.123
Let me ask you one thing.

32:28.834 --> 32:31.588
- You're all in on Matsson, huh?
- Yeah.

32:31.588 --> 32:35.967
I guess. Your brothers hate me,
and you hate me,

32:36.801 --> 32:38.887
and you'll fire me, so yeah.

32:38.887 --> 32:45.477
I don't entirely know what to do.

32:49.022 --> 32:51.315
Regarding Matsson?

32:53.150 --> 32:54.610
Yeah.

32:54.610 --> 32:57.447
- Well, we have a connection.
- You have a connection?

32:57.864 --> 32:59.491
Yeah. What?

32:59.491 --> 33:02.743
Because you want to suck him off,

33:02.743 --> 33:05.037
you think that I must want to fuck him?

33:05.037 --> 33:08.416
That we're all going to live together
in a big old Matsson house,

33:08.416 --> 33:10.876
fucking each other
and singing Matsson songs?

33:10.876 --> 33:16.383
Still keeping all your options open,
honey. Yeah?

33:16.383 --> 33:17.801
You should be careful with that.

33:18.884 --> 33:22.596
Truth bombs from the phony man.

33:24.431 --> 33:29.395
I think I want you.
I think I would like this back.

33:37.986 --> 33:41.615
Well, then you shouldn't
have betrayed me.

33:44.993 --> 33:46.204
Phony.

33:52.127 --> 33:55.588
If I try to say it,
if I try to say the truth,

33:58.799 --> 34:03.262
it's that when I met you,
all my life,

34:04.681 --> 34:07.517
I've been thinking
a little bit about money,

34:08.601 --> 34:11.938
and how to get money,
and how to keep money.

34:13.982 --> 34:15.817
And you didn't ask me in.

34:17.736 --> 34:19.279
Shiv, you kept me out.

34:20.112 --> 34:22.157
And I always agreed
to all the compartments,

34:22.157 --> 34:24.616
but it seemed to me
that I was going to be caught

34:24.616 --> 34:27.037
between you and your dad.

34:29.122 --> 34:34.251
And I really, really love my career,
and my money,

34:35.170 --> 34:39.007
and, you know, the suits,
and my watches.

34:40.716 --> 34:44.512
Yeah, sure, I know.
I like nice things, I do.

34:45.929 --> 34:48.516
And if you think that's shallow,
why don't you throw out all your stuff

34:48.516 --> 34:49.726
for love?

34:49.726 --> 34:51.811
Throw out your necklaces
and your jewels

34:51.811 --> 34:54.521
for a date at a three star Italian.

34:56.357 --> 34:58.233
Come and live with me
in a trailer park.

35:00.236 --> 35:02.572
Yeah? Are you coming?

35:14.292 --> 35:20.465
Well, I'd follow you anywhere
for love, Tom Wambsgans.

35:38.107 --> 35:41.569
I'm convinced that the Living Plus
real estate brand

35:41.569 --> 35:44.363
can bring the cruise ship experience
to dry land

35:44.363 --> 35:46.573
and provide a significant boost
to the earnings...

35:46.573 --> 35:49.076
Okay, you can stop it.

35:49.076 --> 35:52.122
We wanted to say double
the earnings

35:52.122 --> 35:54.248
instead of a significant boost.

35:55.999 --> 35:59.337
Well, I'm not sure that I can do that.

36:01.881 --> 36:04.133
But I bet you can.

36:05.175 --> 36:08.138
Well, I can talk to the sound editor,

36:08.138 --> 36:09.764
but without those words,
without him saying...

36:09.764 --> 36:13.017
You can build it from other bits.

36:13.977 --> 36:16.938
Yeah, I don't know if I can.

36:17.771 --> 36:20.816
Well, yeah, you can.
I need you to.

36:20.816 --> 36:24.028
It's just that technically
I don't think that I can do that.

36:24.028 --> 36:27.490
Look, that's enough, okay?

36:27.490 --> 36:31.578
Just fucking make it happen.

36:32.579 --> 36:34.496
- Make it happen, okay?
- Okay.

36:35.165 --> 36:38.083
Or I get in trouble.
And I don't want to get in trouble.

36:38.083 --> 36:39.752
I want to get in the good books.

36:39.752 --> 36:41.588
So, you help me get in the good books.

36:41.588 --> 36:44.174
Understand, Mr. Snippy Snip?

36:45.258 --> 36:47.260
What if we doubled that?

36:50.596 --> 36:52.765
What is that?
Can we double it?

36:52.765 --> 36:54.976
You know the specific business
better than me,

36:54.976 --> 36:57.394
but on units,
if we go optimistic...

36:57.394 --> 36:59.814
- Go explosive, Pete.
- I guess.

36:59.814 --> 37:04.444
The first wave being Florida,
Colorado, Arizona, 500.

37:04.444 --> 37:07.489
- Could that be 1 000?
- I suppose, yeah.

37:07.489 --> 37:09.948
And then the five
and 10 year projections?

37:09.948 --> 37:12.618
It needs to be super credible, Pete.
It's got to be credible.

37:12.618 --> 37:15.746
New products and services, machine
learning on the marketing,

37:15.746 --> 37:17.916
plus repackaging health data
to third parties.

37:17.916 --> 37:21.044
Easily, easily grow
that to 3% per month.

37:21.044 --> 37:23.129
What does that do to CAGR?

37:24.839 --> 37:27.132
- Does it make it bigger, Pete?
- It makes it a lot better.

37:27.132 --> 37:30.512
What? 50% per year,
five years with 10x revenue?

37:30.512 --> 37:31.638
Can I talk to Karl?

37:31.638 --> 37:33.682
What is the biggest headline
number that's credible?

37:33.682 --> 37:35.308
The thing is,
numbers aren't just numbers.

37:35.308 --> 37:38.311
- They're numbers.
- You're talking gibberish, Pete.

37:39.980 --> 37:42.983
No, I'm just kidding. I'm kidding.
I'm fucking with you.

37:43.441 --> 37:48.445
Pete, if it feels scary, it's because
the potential is scary, Pete.

37:48.445 --> 37:50.740
Sure. No. Good.

37:51.825 --> 37:54.494
Hey, I need you to be comfortable,

37:54.494 --> 37:57.247
because the analysts,
they're going to get into us on this.

37:57.247 --> 38:00.375
Are you confident?
Are you confident, Pete?

38:00.375 --> 38:04.211
I think we can make the argument.
We can make the argument.

38:05.046 --> 38:07.090
Great. Fuck yeah!

38:34.576 --> 38:37.746
Hey, Lukas.
Hey, sweetie.

38:37.746 --> 38:39.331
Hey.

38:39.705 --> 38:43.501
So, look,
I figured that I should mention

38:43.501 --> 38:46.378
we are going to be pushing Living Plus.

38:48.840 --> 38:50.759
I don't like real estate.

38:51.384 --> 38:54.720
It's not scalable, and I don't
want the hassle of unwinding.

38:54.720 --> 38:57.890
- Is there any way you can stop it?
- No.

38:57.890 --> 39:01.435
No, I can't.
I mean, like how?

39:01.435 --> 39:06.106
I don't know. You can turn off
the lights or bomb threat.

39:06.106 --> 39:09.653
Look, I am being very generous
telling you stuff

39:09.653 --> 39:12.155
because I feel like it's appropriate
given where we're at,

39:12.155 --> 39:16.575
but I'm not about to start dropping
stage weights on people's heads.

39:16.910 --> 39:19.828
- Let me have a think about it.
- Okay. Bye.

39:29.254 --> 39:30.548
Good morning.

39:32.216 --> 39:34.760
- How we doing?
- Good.

39:35.302 --> 39:39.808
The house. In the end, the guys
couldn't achieve everything.

39:42.560 --> 39:44.562
This won't be just this, will it?

39:45.522 --> 39:49.818
Well, no. We're throwing something
over it. We can do it with light.

39:50.360 --> 39:51.778
You did the clouds?

39:52.152 --> 39:54.113
- Yeah.
- Can I see them?

39:54.113 --> 39:56.616
John! Hit on the clouds.

39:56.616 --> 39:58.076
Hold the work.

40:16.677 --> 40:21.474
Guys, that's not the clouds.
It's not the clouds at all.

40:22.266 --> 40:24.060
I told you I saw it in Berlin.

40:25.645 --> 40:28.398
We were in touch with them, but...

40:29.274 --> 40:33.653
Just let me think.

40:41.493 --> 40:44.998
What do you think, man? It still fits?
The words?

40:44.998 --> 40:47.667
The words? The words, yes.

40:48.668 --> 40:52.504
Where did those fun little numbers,
where did that come from?

40:54.883 --> 40:57.801
- From up here.
- From up there.

40:57.801 --> 41:00.138
- Hey, projections, right?
- Sure.

41:01.347 --> 41:03.767
I'm kidding. No, we have it.
Pete has it.

41:03.767 --> 41:05.894
- Yeah?
- It's all good. Yeah.

41:05.894 --> 41:08.187
Hockey stick, we're pushing
to the moon, right, Rome?

41:08.187 --> 41:09.606
To the moon.

41:11.357 --> 41:15.069
- Hello.
- What do you think about the words?

41:15.069 --> 41:17.696
Yeah, the words are good.
The words are okay.

41:17.696 --> 41:19.156
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

41:19.156 --> 41:21.325
What about the numbers?

41:21.867 --> 41:23.078
Yeah.

41:23.078 --> 41:28.582
I mean, I get the idea,
but, you know, those are big numbers.

41:29.417 --> 41:33.629
I'm worried, Rome.
He's got that gleam in his eye.

41:33.629 --> 41:35.214
That'll be okay.

41:35.214 --> 41:38.093
Jesus Christ, Rome, this is not good.

41:40.136 --> 41:42.054
It's going to be very fucking messy.

41:42.054 --> 41:45.182
You're out of control, he's out
of control, and this is going down.

41:45.182 --> 41:47.184
Should we pull the plug on today?

41:47.184 --> 41:49.771
It's fine.
It's a decent play, I think.

41:51.063 --> 41:55.902
Sure. Made up numbers and shooting
to the moon and imaginary clouds.

41:55.902 --> 41:58.278
- Dude, come on.
- No, I know.

41:58.278 --> 42:02.366
I think it's high risk, but I think,
you know, we have to back it.

42:03.785 --> 42:05.661
You know he could do anything
up there,

42:06.120 --> 42:09.081
and then you're a part of it.

42:10.083 --> 42:13.419
Like, he has harebrained schemes.

42:13.419 --> 42:15.963
I love him, but it cracks
under pressure,

42:15.963 --> 42:20.551
and I think we should protect him.
We should stop this.

42:37.694 --> 42:39.528
- Roman's here.
- Hey, man! Come on in!

42:39.528 --> 42:41.572
- Hey, hey.
- Hi, how are you?

42:41.572 --> 42:44.409
- Yeah, good.
- Cool digs.

42:44.409 --> 42:47.037
Flight jacket. For the launch.

42:47.037 --> 42:49.413
- For the launch?
- You want to run it?

42:49.413 --> 42:52.292
Should we run it? I'm not doing
the clouds. I decided.

42:52.292 --> 42:54.252
- Because they weren't clouds.
- Don't need them.

42:54.252 --> 42:57.087
We're just going to do an acoustic set.
Ken and Rome unplugged.

42:57.087 --> 42:59.966
Heads up, I've gone even bigger
in Colorado.

42:59.966 --> 43:03.969
- Numbers get crazy good.
- Yeah. Okay.

43:04.596 --> 43:08.140
Dude, it's enough to make
you lose your faith in capitalism.

43:08.140 --> 43:10.852
- Like, you could say anything.
- I'll bet.

43:10.852 --> 43:13.605
- I made you one.
- A jacket?

43:13.605 --> 43:15.732
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's for you.
- Yeah?

43:16.523 --> 43:20.904
- Co-pilots. That's the idea.
- Yeah, okay. I got you.

43:20.904 --> 43:22.489
You got the pages?

43:22.489 --> 43:26.076
In that case, I should talk
a little bit. I just...

43:26.076 --> 43:29.204
What?

43:29.204 --> 43:31.373
I think that... I don't know. Maybe...

43:33.333 --> 43:38.213
Maybe, like, we shouldn't do it

43:38.213 --> 43:41.216
or like, maybe postpone.

43:46.261 --> 43:51.101
Don't. Hey, man,
it's okay. It's not...

43:52.393 --> 43:57.731
Shit. Maybe we just dump it on
fucking Ray.

43:57.731 --> 43:59.650
Look, it's his division.

43:59.650 --> 44:03.071
But maybe not do the whole...

44:03.779 --> 44:08.201
This is the idea, though.

44:08.201 --> 44:11.829
I know. Maybe I just worry
that I can't sell it.

44:12.497 --> 44:14.666
So, do we pull it?

44:15.500 --> 44:18.169
- You think it's nuts?
- No, no.

44:18.169 --> 44:22.047
I mean, pitching fucking
playhouses and living forever

44:22.047 --> 44:23.967
and doubling up the fucking numbers...

44:23.967 --> 44:26.927
It's time. It's big swing time.
We have to.

44:26.927 --> 44:31.056
I know. I just,
maybe I just worry that it's...

44:31.683 --> 44:34.352
They're your words.

44:34.352 --> 44:36.311
You got the words.
You got the fucking skills.

44:36.311 --> 44:40.108
And I just might, you know...
It's your vision, this whole thing,

44:40.108 --> 44:42.526
and I've sort of been...
I might fuck it.

44:46.406 --> 44:47.614
Oh, man!

44:47.614 --> 44:49.993
We could also rain check this,
do this some other time

44:49.993 --> 44:52.579
and see if something else comes up.

44:53.747 --> 44:56.498
Hi. It's time.

44:56.498 --> 44:58.335
- It's time?
- Yep.

44:58.335 --> 45:00.378
Great. It's gonna be great. It is.

45:00.378 --> 45:02.088
You're gonna kill it.
I read the thing

45:02.088 --> 45:04.923
and I know you
and this is gonna be, you know...

45:04.923 --> 45:06.718
Good luck. Break that leg.

45:14.850 --> 45:16.894
- Karl wants to...
- Hey, Karl.

45:16.894 --> 45:19.230
- Hi. Just to say good luck, huh?
- Thanks, man.

45:19.230 --> 45:21.982
Just to get some visibility,
if that's okay,

45:21.982 --> 45:26.362
'cause I just heard that more tweaks
have been made in my arena.

45:26.362 --> 45:27.489
It's cool.

45:27.489 --> 45:31.075
- If I could just take a quick peek.
- Karl, man, it's not a good time.

45:31.075 --> 45:33.035
Then if you could just talk me
through it.

45:33.035 --> 45:36.831
Just so I'm comfortable in my own
mind that I got your back.

45:36.831 --> 45:38.791
It is all good, Karl, okay?
It's all good.

45:38.791 --> 45:41.502
- Just a second. Hang on.
- It's not a good time, Karl.

45:41.502 --> 45:43.338
Really? Well, listen to me.

45:44.714 --> 45:48.133
I took a lot of shit from your dad
because we've been through the mill,

45:48.133 --> 45:52.722
but I've been a CFO at major public
companies for over two decades.

45:52.722 --> 45:54.683
And I know a thing or two
about a thing or two.

45:54.683 --> 45:56.226
And if you fuck up his deal,

45:56.643 --> 45:59.687
or you try to stand up numbers
that I am not comfortable with,

45:59.687 --> 46:01.188
I swear to God...

46:01.188 --> 46:03.315
Hey, easy.

46:03.899 --> 46:06.653
CEO, CFO.

46:06.653 --> 46:10.572
What, you gonna fire your chief
financial officer a week in?

46:11.156 --> 46:12.783
Your dad just gone?

46:15.036 --> 46:19.290
You'd be fucking toast.
You have my dick in your hand, Ken.

46:19.915 --> 46:22.836
But I've got yours in mine.
So let's get real.

46:22.836 --> 46:25.671
If you say anything
that I don't like up there,

46:25.671 --> 46:29.634
or make me look foolish,
I'll fucking squeal.

46:34.054 --> 46:36.516
Good luck. Good luck to you, buddy.

46:48.152 --> 46:50.779
We'll be there every step of the way,

46:50.779 --> 46:53.992
giving you all the breaking stories,
all the inside scoops,

46:53.992 --> 46:58.246
and all the expert analysis
America has come to depend on.

46:58.246 --> 47:01.458
Four years ago,
election night coverage drew

47:01.458 --> 47:06.046
71.4 million viewers across
a dozen networks

47:06.046 --> 47:07.463
according to Nielsen.

47:07.463 --> 47:10.884
And fully half of them were due
to ATN.

47:14.929 --> 47:16.056
How's he doing?

47:17.015 --> 47:18.600
Good, good, good.

47:18.600 --> 47:21.477
... so this election promises to be
a very good year for America,

47:21.477 --> 47:25.357
for democracy,
and for ATN ad revenue,

47:25.357 --> 47:27.858
and for you, our shareholders.

47:34.783 --> 47:38.912
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome co-CEO, Kendall Roy.

47:51.757 --> 47:57.222
Okay. Thank you. Hey, yeah.

47:58.890 --> 48:02.394
Big shoes. Big, big shoes.

48:04.770 --> 48:08.816
Big, big shoes.
Big, big shoes.

48:09.150 --> 48:12.445
Big shoes. Big hat.
Big nervous breakdown.

48:13.570 --> 48:17.075
Okay. It says here on my words

48:17.075 --> 48:22.996
that I'm glad to be here
and you know I kind of am.

48:23.580 --> 48:25.333
So thanks prompter.

48:25.333 --> 48:28.878
Don't talk to the teleprompter, amateur.

48:28.878 --> 48:31.296
- Why is that bad?
- You don't do that.

48:31.296 --> 48:35.926
I was up at something like this.
I was disrupting our annual meeting

48:35.926 --> 48:40.222
and now I'm CEO. Co-CEO.

48:42.266 --> 48:44.852
And you know I just want to say
thank you.

48:44.852 --> 48:47.272
I want to thank
the whole Waystar family

48:47.272 --> 48:49.606
who have offered us so much love
and support

48:49.606 --> 48:54.654
over these last few tough days.
We're so grateful. Thank you.

48:59.284 --> 49:01.786
It means a lot.

49:02.745 --> 49:03.955
Isn't that right, dad?

49:07.833 --> 49:11.755
- No!
- Oh my God. My fucking God!

49:11.755 --> 49:14.382
This is all new.

49:14.382 --> 49:18.218
We had our differences.
But it is good to see you.

49:19.386 --> 49:22.641
- Let's get on with it.
- Yeah, for sure.

49:22.641 --> 49:25.100
- Strangest double act ever.
- I'll say.

49:25.100 --> 49:27.686
- He never changes.
- Fucking amateur hour.

49:27.686 --> 49:29.146
Wake me up when it's over.

49:29.146 --> 49:30.898
I don't know if I can watch this.

49:30.898 --> 49:33.193
She said while watching the fuck out
of it and getting turned on.

49:33.193 --> 49:35.027
I can hear how wet you are.
It's gross.

49:35.027 --> 49:37.405
Jesus, Ken. Keep it fucking white.

49:37.405 --> 49:39.031
You don't even have to worry
about your speech.

49:39.031 --> 49:41.576
You just go on and mop up
all the blood.

49:41.993 --> 49:43.827
Today I want to share with you

49:44.996 --> 49:48.750
an extraordinary product that my father
was working on to the very end.

49:49.500 --> 49:52.711
It's an exciting new vision
we call Living Plus.

49:54.923 --> 49:56.549
Yeah!

49:57.133 --> 49:58.259
Living Plus.

49:58.259 --> 50:01.304
Look the world's tough.
It's getting tougher.

50:02.389 --> 50:05.599
What our incredible new product offers
is a sanctuary.

50:06.642 --> 50:10.188
It's a place where it doesn't feel
you or your mom or dad

50:10.188 --> 50:12.190
are surviving life.

50:13.524 --> 50:19.030
It's somewhere you're really living.
Living Plus.

50:20.031 --> 50:22.534
Now rebranded
"Kendall goes woo woo".

50:22.950 --> 50:25.787
If I cringe any harder I might become
a fossil.

50:25.787 --> 50:28.915
Our brand turboed Living Plus
real estate communities

50:28.915 --> 50:32.918
are going to guarantee
three absolute essentials.

50:32.918 --> 50:36.131
One, total peace of mind,
discrete community protection,

50:36.131 --> 50:38.006
and enhanced home monitoring.

50:38.590 --> 50:42.012
You'll have your keys,
but you won't need them.

50:43.013 --> 50:45.764
Crime-free, hassle-free,
and respectful.

50:46.641 --> 50:48.934
Two. Fun.

50:49.935 --> 50:55.315
This is good. Is that you?
Very good.

50:55.315 --> 50:57.401
Fun is what we're all about
at Waystar,

50:57.401 --> 51:00.155
by a lot of metrics, the leading
entertainment brand in the world.

51:00.155 --> 51:03.032
So hyper local news,

51:03.032 --> 51:05.200
movie themed events,
advanced screenings,

51:05.200 --> 51:08.621
ATN debate and discussions,
multimedia events

51:08.621 --> 51:11.041
from cooking
to premium access sports.

51:11.957 --> 51:15.920
We're talking integrated everyday
character IP life enhancement.

51:16.379 --> 51:19.924
Maybe a director will swing
by with a rough cut.

51:19.924 --> 51:24.428
Stars certainly will.
Movies, shows, rides,

51:24.428 --> 51:26.222
experiences to enjoy at home

51:26.222 --> 51:29.016
or with the family who
will not want to stop visiting.

51:29.016 --> 51:31.685
We can even tell them you're out
if you need a break.

51:32.728 --> 51:36.523
We think that security
plus entertainment

51:36.523 --> 51:39.568
is a pretty unbeatable offer, right?

51:40.152 --> 51:43.073
Well, one more thing.
How about I told you

51:43.073 --> 51:45.158
it was all going to last forever?

51:45.575 --> 51:48.286
Okay, now we're leaving planet Earth.

51:48.286 --> 51:50.079
I'm glad you're not strapped in.

51:51.080 --> 51:53.291
Well, I can't. I can't. Not quite yet.

51:53.291 --> 51:57.587
We're not there yet.
But our central extraordinary offer

51:57.587 --> 52:00.297
is health and happiness.

52:00.757 --> 52:02.676
Because here's what makes
this amazing new product

52:02.676 --> 52:05.135
almost irresistible.

52:05.135 --> 52:08.556
Our incredible links with tech
and pharmaceutical companies

52:08.556 --> 52:11.685
which mean privileged access
to life enhancement

52:11.685 --> 52:12.893
and extension therapies

52:12.893 --> 52:15.271
that right now are the preserve
of tech billionaires.

52:15.271 --> 52:17.648
But we're going to deliver them
at home, at scale,

52:17.648 --> 52:19.775
targeted and supported.

52:20.234 --> 52:21.653
- Hi!
- I don't like it.

52:22.696 --> 52:23.904
Can you stop it?

52:23.904 --> 52:26.407
You don't want to make
prison camps for granny?

52:26.407 --> 52:27.574
What's the game?

52:27.574 --> 52:29.327
He's running the bullshit unicycle,

52:29.327 --> 52:31.871
but maybe someone could put
a stick in the spokes.

52:31.871 --> 52:33.747
Do we have anything behind me?

52:33.747 --> 52:36.626
Nothing behind you.
The screen will just be black,

52:36.626 --> 52:38.419
but that's good because then
it's all about you.

52:39.671 --> 52:41.881
We can get a light on you.

52:42.631 --> 52:45.175
I would hope I'm being spotlit.

52:45.676 --> 52:48.971
My dad, he'd been around a little bit.

52:49.513 --> 52:52.767
He was conservative on these matters

52:52.767 --> 52:56.521
and in terms of earnings
growth he has this to say.

52:57.063 --> 53:00.692
I'm convinced that the Living Plus
real estate brand

53:00.692 --> 53:03.194
can bring the cruise ship experience
to dry land

53:03.194 --> 53:05.529
and double the earnings
of our parks division.

53:10.118 --> 53:11.536
Double the earnings.

53:11.536 --> 53:14.413
Okay. That's not fucking cool.

53:15.832 --> 53:17.124
Well, it's really well edited.

53:17.124 --> 53:18.793
Can we really do it?

53:19.502 --> 53:23.006
Are people who subscribe
to Living Plus support

53:23.006 --> 53:27.468
really gonna live 10, 20, 30, 40, 50
years more?

53:28.093 --> 53:32.097
Is it worth it? Living Plus is going
to be a premium product.

53:33.307 --> 53:34.601
Is it worth it?

53:36.268 --> 53:39.272
Well if you ask me
would I take an extra year

53:39.272 --> 53:43.150
right now with my dad?
Say the unsaid?

53:48.864 --> 53:50.366
That would be priceless.

53:52.493 --> 53:56.498
Yeah, I miss you, dad.
I love you, dad.

54:03.545 --> 54:06.424
- General buzz is...
- What? How is it?

54:06.424 --> 54:09.259
Really good.
People are liking it.

54:09.259 --> 54:10.636
They're liking it.

54:10.636 --> 54:13.598
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

54:14.557 --> 54:19.312
- Doderick Macht Frei.
- That's a very nasty joke.

54:19.312 --> 54:21.481
That's a holocaust joke.

54:21.481 --> 54:24.942
From our acquirer.
So we might need to strategize.

54:24.942 --> 54:27.027
Hold the Q&A. Can we let him know?

54:27.027 --> 54:28.196
Can we let Kendall know?

54:28.196 --> 54:31.615
Because he's about to face jump
into a buzzsaw.

54:31.615 --> 54:37.246
This is kind of good for you
because your presentation not great.

54:38.081 --> 54:39.915
And so now no one will be watching.

54:39.915 --> 54:42.794
Detailed financials I will leave
to Karl Muller,

54:42.794 --> 54:46.589
our legendary CFO.
There he is. Round of applause.

54:51.343 --> 54:54.264
But any questions
with a broader overview?

54:55.390 --> 54:57.099
Yeah, Raj.

54:58.726 --> 55:00.269
Good to see you guys.

55:01.228 --> 55:03.480
Hi. Congratulations on a great presentation.

55:03.480 --> 55:06.359
I just want to know how you feel
about Lukas Matsson's response,

55:06.359 --> 55:08.027
his tweet right now?

55:09.236 --> 55:12.073
Sorry, I'm catching up.

55:13.949 --> 55:18.663
He's tweeted the words
Doderick Macht Frei,

55:19.997 --> 55:21.123
which is from the...

55:21.123 --> 55:26.504
Yeah, I know what it's from.
Give me a sec.

55:35.388 --> 55:37.723
Okay. What's your response?

55:38.683 --> 55:41.645
Well, I'm not gonna fave it.

55:43.103 --> 55:47.025
Everybody knows here knows we're
looking at a deal with Lukas

55:47.649 --> 55:51.904
and you know I have so much time
and respect for what he's built.

55:51.904 --> 55:59.244
Now personally I wouldn't have said
that and sincere apologies

55:59.244 --> 56:01.998
for any offense caused.

56:01.998 --> 56:06.502
You know he's very European.

56:09.088 --> 56:13.300
And if and when we complete
the deal

56:13.842 --> 56:17.471
and he gets into the incredible
opportunity this product presents,

56:17.471 --> 56:19.556
I think he'll be tweeting something different.

56:19.556 --> 56:23.395
Maybe you're giving this too much
attention than it deserves?

56:23.395 --> 56:25.896
Just back off? No?

56:35.448 --> 56:37.825
No, no, he's handling himself
very well.

56:38.742 --> 56:42.122
He's smart but we don't always
come across as we intend

56:42.664 --> 56:44.039
on social media.

56:44.498 --> 56:49.211
And one of the things about Living Plus
actually is that we see it going beyond.

56:50.796 --> 56:54.259
It's kind of like social media,
but it's better.

56:54.259 --> 56:58.805
It's physical social media,
in the real world.

56:58.805 --> 57:03.767
I think people are hungry
for that connection. I know I am.

57:06.562 --> 57:11.108
Any more questions? No?
That's my time.

57:11.108 --> 57:15.904
It's been so fun sharing
this with you. It's been so fun.

57:15.904 --> 57:19.450
How am I supposed to follow this?
He just promised them eternal life.

57:20.160 --> 57:24.788
Thank you guys and thank you, dad.

57:25.874 --> 57:27.374
Is it Tom?

57:28.168 --> 57:31.420
ATN chair,
Tom Wambsgans.

57:33.505 --> 57:35.716
- I'm here cheering you on.
- Thanks, buddy.

57:35.716 --> 57:37.634
- Warmed them up for you.
- Thanks, Ken.

57:37.634 --> 57:42.682
- Go Tom!
- Launched it. Launched that shit!

57:43.432 --> 57:48.562
And you are an ATN citizen,
and you are an ATN citizen

57:48.562 --> 57:51.149
and I'm an ATN citizen.

57:52.609 --> 57:53.984
Yeah!

57:58.823 --> 58:03.285
- Knew you could do it!
- Proud of you.

58:04.244 --> 58:07.165
Thanks, guys. Thanks for being here.
How we doing?

58:07.832 --> 58:10.210
- Memestock frothing.
- Yada yada on the reels.

58:10.210 --> 58:14.713
Good vibes with sell. Bloomberg
has positive snaps coming.

58:14.713 --> 58:17.424
- Seeing some movement.
- The king is dead.

58:17.424 --> 58:21.388
Long live the king, kings and queen.

58:21.388 --> 58:23.765
Long live the kings and queen.

58:23.765 --> 58:27.394
The motherfucker deleted it.
He deleted the tweet.

58:27.726 --> 58:29.853
- Really?
- Here you go, man.

58:29.853 --> 58:32.898
See anything? Nothing to see.

58:32.898 --> 58:35.067
That's fucking right.
Now we're talking.

58:35.067 --> 58:37.236
Climb down.
Price rocket.

58:37.236 --> 58:40.823
- Houston we have fucking liftoff.
- Great work, boss man.

58:41.323 --> 58:43.118
I was here cheering you on.

58:43.118 --> 58:46.371
He's special. I know special
and he is special.

58:46.371 --> 58:49.499
Houston we have special.
We have special.

58:56.463 --> 58:58.925
I don't even remember it.
It's kind of a blur.

59:00.385 --> 59:03.054
Just like walking on the moon.

59:05.389 --> 59:06.683
Yeah, walking on the moon.

59:17.735 --> 59:21.572
I want to make what I think
is a fairly historic announcement.

59:22.324 --> 59:26.160
I'm convinced that Roman Roy
has a micro dick

59:26.160 --> 59:27.828
and always gets it wrong.

59:29.705 --> 59:34.501
I want to make what I think is a fairly
historic announcement.

59:34.501 --> 59:38.006
I'm convinced that Roman Roy
has a micro dick

59:38.589 --> 59:40.299
and always gets it wrong.

59:42.093 --> 59:45.722
I want to make what I think is a fairly
historic announcement.

59:46.765 --> 59:50.225
I'm convinced that Roman Roy
has a micro dick

59:50.852 --> 59:52.311
and always gets it wrong.

59:58.234 --> 1:00:02.112
I want to make what I think is a fairly
historic announcement.

1:00:06.034 --> 1:00:12.498
I think, if we're thinking of hosting,
I can't get into any of our shit.

1:00:13.958 --> 1:00:18.630
I think it has to be
strictly party and strategy.

1:00:18.630 --> 1:00:21.216
Yeah. Entirely.

1:00:23.218 --> 1:00:25.971
I can't help it if I find strategy
sexy though.

1:00:28.222 --> 1:00:29.264
I do.
