00:08.320 --> 00:09.400
Mm-hmm.

00:19.640 --> 00:20.560
How do I look?

00:20.640 --> 00:21.680
Gorgeous.

00:22.360 --> 00:25.160
Go and take a look at yourself
in the mirror. Right now, Adam.

00:25.240 --> 00:26.560
Go look in the mirror.

00:30.960 --> 00:31.960
I look quite pretty.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.760
Introducing Adamina from Moordale!

00:45.880 --> 00:47.200
Babe, you're gonna ruin my makeup.

00:48.720 --> 00:50.480
I will ruin you.

01:00.960 --> 01:03.600
I think I'm ready to, you know…

01:04.200 --> 01:05.880
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:05.960 --> 01:07.560
-Really?
-Yes.

01:13.680 --> 01:14.840
Okay.

01:20.960 --> 01:22.160
Okay, switch.

01:24.360 --> 01:27.320
-Adam, what's going on?
-You need to come-- There's--

01:28.120 --> 01:30.280
Okay.

01:30.960 --> 01:31.880
Yeah.

01:33.280 --> 01:35.280
-Adam?
-What?

01:36.200 --> 01:38.280
-Are you all right?

01:38.360 --> 01:40.920
Adam,
would Eric like to stay for dinner?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.840
-She's coming. She will come in.
-Go. Go, now! Go!

01:45.560 --> 01:47.000
Oh God! You okay?

01:51.360 --> 01:53.000
Is everything all right?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.840
-Yeah.
-No. Yeah.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.320
We were just, um…

01:59.440 --> 02:01.120
We were doing karate, so…

02:01.200 --> 02:02.040
Oh.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.880
-Yeah.
-Well, have fun.

02:04.960 --> 02:06.080
Ooh!

02:08.040 --> 02:09.040
Okay.

02:16.680 --> 02:18.920
You know your mum knows
we're not just friends, right?

02:20.160 --> 02:22.680
Maybe you should tell her?

02:23.880 --> 02:26.240
Uh, yeah, I will. Just not yet.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.200
So, do you still wanna do it?

02:32.640 --> 02:33.560
Oh yeah.

02:33.640 --> 02:34.520
Yeah?

02:35.440 --> 02:37.720
-Dinner's ready in five minutes!
-Okay. Okay.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.280
So not tonight,
but we're going to have sex,

02:41.360 --> 02:43.280
and I'm so excited!

03:08.000 --> 03:09.880
"Gifted and Talented."

03:09.960 --> 03:10.800
What?

03:11.760 --> 03:15.520
Oh, it's a scheme thing,
to study in America for a couple months.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.960
My teacher wants me to apply.
I think it sounds a bit stupid.

03:19.040 --> 03:22.160
Studying in America doesn't sound stupid.
You should definitely apply.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.720
Gifted, talented?

03:25.800 --> 03:27.480
-That's all you, baby!

03:28.000 --> 03:29.720
Yeah, well, I can't afford it, so…

03:32.800 --> 03:34.480
You've got a bit of jam on your face.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.720
-Where?
-No, I'm gonna throw up. Get it off.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.440
-Get it off. It's disgusting.
-Can you do it, please?

03:41.880 --> 03:43.280
-Got it.
-Thanks.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.240
Okay, I better go.
I'll see you two fuckwits later.

03:49.320 --> 03:51.000
Have fun applying for the scheme.

03:51.080 --> 03:53.240
-Except I'm not applying.
-Except you are.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.440
It's starting to feel a bit
Two Weeks Notice in here, just saying.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.400
Do you mean 9½ Weeks?

04:04.800 --> 04:05.880
I do.

04:08.760 --> 04:09.600
Ugly.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.600
Really ugly.

04:11.680 --> 04:12.560
The ugliest.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.080
That. I quite like that one.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.760
Oh, are you sure about this?

04:50.360 --> 04:51.440
I look like Magneto.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.520
I'm sure.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.560
But the facial hair has got to go. Sorry.

04:59.640 --> 05:01.720
Why? I spent all summer growing this.

05:01.800 --> 05:02.960
-Aww.
-Please!

05:07.040 --> 05:08.520
I prefer kissing you without it.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.920
I will go and shave it off, then.

05:12.960 --> 05:14.400
Don't forget your jacket!

05:15.880 --> 05:17.640
It's Anwar's. He's cool with it.

05:19.560 --> 05:20.680
I'll wait downstairs.

05:27.480 --> 05:28.720
Hello, Mr. Hendricks.

05:31.840 --> 05:34.640
Morning, Ruby. Would you like some

05:35.440 --> 05:36.280
breakfast?

05:36.360 --> 05:38.400
-You don't have any nut milk?
-Mm-mm.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.520
Well, if I eat anything else
before00 a.m., I'll vom.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.080
So, no, thanks.

05:45.920 --> 05:49.680
I am very glad you feel comfortable
staying the night with Otis.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.000
I want you both to feel
that this is a safe space

05:53.080 --> 05:54.400
to explore your relationship.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.760
Oh, we're just having casual sex.
I would never date him.

05:59.320 --> 06:02.840
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I was never this gassy with Otis.

06:02.920 --> 06:05.720
Doesn't it feel kind of gross
having something growing inside you?

06:05.800 --> 06:08.440
No. Feels quite natural.

06:08.520 --> 06:09.840
That would make me claustrophobic.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.600
Well, that's interesting.
Why would you think that?

06:14.440 --> 06:16.560
What if the father
turns out to be a dickhead?

06:16.640 --> 06:20.360
Then I have to see him until the day I die
just because he impregnated me.

06:20.440 --> 06:21.640
Well, there is that.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.400
-Commitment can be a frightening prospect.

06:24.480 --> 06:28.520
Mum, can you please not therapize
my friend?

06:28.600 --> 06:30.040
Good morning, darling.

06:30.120 --> 06:32.160
That is an interesting outfit.

06:32.240 --> 06:33.440
Very suave.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.480
-Told you I look stupid.
-You don't look stupid, OT.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.760
You look chic and expensive.

06:40.440 --> 06:41.280
OT?

06:42.080 --> 06:45.080
Oh yeah. Otis was a bit babyish,
so I changed it.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.240
Okay, let's go.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.680
-So you're getting back together?
-No.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.960
We're gonna co-parent.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.320
-Are you upset?
-No.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.960
Yes. I'm confused.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.680
I thought you liked Jean.

07:06.400 --> 07:07.760
She really hurt you, Dad.

07:08.680 --> 07:11.120
Listen,
I think I just need time to process this.

07:12.840 --> 07:13.760
Okay.

07:15.600 --> 07:16.920
I love you, kid.

07:22.640 --> 07:25.520
-What you writin'?
-No, don't read it yet. It's not ready.

07:26.040 --> 07:28.400
The Moordale Gazette announced
a short fiction competition.

07:28.480 --> 07:29.800
It's a five grand prize!

07:29.880 --> 07:32.280
Think how much latex
I could get with that.

07:35.800 --> 07:36.800
You all right?

07:37.920 --> 07:40.720
I found out my dad's going to have
a baby with Jean Milburn.

07:40.800 --> 07:41.640
Ew!

07:41.720 --> 07:43.280
-Aren't they too old?
-Yes.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.480
Does that mean
Otis is gonna be your brother?

07:49.240 --> 07:51.000
Oh shit!

07:53.600 --> 07:55.000
Why is everyone staring?

07:56.800 --> 07:58.720
Because you're with me, obviously.

08:03.560 --> 08:05.360
Why are you walking like that?

08:06.040 --> 08:07.200
This is my walk.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.720
Well, change it!

08:09.520 --> 08:10.440
Whoa!

08:10.520 --> 08:12.400
-They're really a thing now.
-Mm-hm.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.560
Sure you're okay?

08:13.640 --> 08:15.080
Yeah, I'm fine, honestly.

08:16.200 --> 08:17.640
What's that line doing here?

08:49.400 --> 08:52.480
Gross. These lockers are hideous.
Gray completely washes me out.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.040
Didn't you tell him
we're not allowed to wear beige or brown?

08:55.120 --> 08:58.200
I didn't actually have a lot to work with,
so be nice, yeah?

08:59.560 --> 09:00.960
Why is he wearing my jacket?

09:03.280 --> 09:05.360
-Would you like it back, Anwar?
-Yes.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.520
No, he wouldn't.

09:06.600 --> 09:10.920
Oh my God! I have to talk to you now! I--
Why do you look like Magneto?

09:11.000 --> 09:13.640
-Um, Ruby's dressed me.
-Yeah, I can see that.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.440
Sorry, Ruby.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.920
-Okay, we'll see you at lunch, OT.
-We're having lunch together?

09:20.520 --> 09:23.520
No, you are having lunch with us.
Remember, we only drink Coke Zero.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.160
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Okay?

09:25.840 --> 09:26.840
He's stolen my look.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.600
Anwar, you can't own a look.

09:28.680 --> 09:29.600
Right.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.560
What are you doing?

09:33.640 --> 09:36.200
-Well, gotta find a new look now, don't I?

09:37.160 --> 09:41.000
FYI, this, dangerously close to brown.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.480
Good morning, baby.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.760
Where… where you going?

09:47.840 --> 09:49.120
Okay, okay, okay.

09:49.760 --> 09:54.480
Guess who's going all the way tonight?

09:54.560 --> 09:56.400
Come on, yeah! Huh!

09:56.480 --> 09:57.720
I'm guessing it's you.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.720
You're supposed to look happy for me.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.120
I'm happy. I am happy, Eric!

10:02.200 --> 10:03.040
Uh-huh.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.320
Are you sure
Adam isn't gonna mess you around?

10:05.400 --> 10:08.640
I think he's not comfortable with himself.
I don't want you to get hurt.

10:08.720 --> 10:13.040
Enough! I don't want to hear
your feelings about Adam now.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.360
-Yeah.
-I want you to be my best friend.

10:16.440 --> 10:21.840
And ask questions
about me going all the way, way, way!

10:21.920 --> 10:23.960
-You're right, okay. Sorry.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.600
So, where's it gonna happen?

10:25.680 --> 10:29.040
Well, both our parents are home,
so I'm making a romantic picnic.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.360
We're gonna do it alfresco.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.280
Alfresco?

10:31.360 --> 10:32.640
-Eh-heh.
-Mm-hmm.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.840
-Eh-heh. Eh-heh.
-Eh-heh. Eh-heh!

10:45.160 --> 10:49.280
-Hey, why's these lines on the floors?
-Think we're supposed to walk single file.

10:49.360 --> 10:50.520
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

10:59.240 --> 11:00.600
Give us a hand, Adam.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.600
No, thanks, I'm all right.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.600
Okay, good morn--

11:10.680 --> 11:13.320
-Very funny, very funny.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.920
Okay, who did this?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.400
It was Adam, miss.

11:18.480 --> 11:19.880
No. It wasn't, Dylan.

11:19.960 --> 11:22.480
I've covered for you before.
You do this every time. Outside, now.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.560
Ooh!

11:24.640 --> 11:27.400
Everyone else,
turn to page 25 of the workbook.

11:27.480 --> 11:28.680
Read from the top.

12:10.960 --> 12:12.800
-That's it! Good!

12:25.960 --> 12:27.720
-Oh shit!

12:27.800 --> 12:29.280
-Go!

12:29.360 --> 12:30.840
-Two, three!

12:52.320 --> 12:53.480
Thank you.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.080
Hey, Hope!

12:55.160 --> 12:57.360
We're working on
a little thing for assembly.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.960
It's gonna be epic.
Why don't you pull up a chair?

13:00.040 --> 13:04.600
No, thank you, Colin.
Um, could I borrow Jackson, please?

13:04.680 --> 13:06.720
Yeah, cool. Okay!

13:06.800 --> 13:09.720
Sopranos,
all I can hear is "tit-ties," all right?

13:09.800 --> 13:13.120
It's "titties."
I want you to be like a cat on heat.

13:17.560 --> 13:21.760
I wanted to hear your initial thoughts
on the new hallway guidelines.

13:22.960 --> 13:24.960
Uh, they're interesting.

13:25.040 --> 13:29.120
Interesting is a non-word, Jackson.
Tell me what you really think.

13:29.840 --> 13:32.640
-I guess I don't understand the lines.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.480
-Feels a bit militant.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.920
It's more about creating
a calmer environment for learning.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.400
To encourage the students to take time,

13:40.480 --> 13:42.760
to be quiet,
and present with their own minds.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.280
Kind of like a Buddhist thing?

13:44.360 --> 13:45.280
No.

13:45.360 --> 13:48.080
-No, I do think it's important…

13:48.160 --> 13:51.160
…for students
to use the time between lessons

13:51.240 --> 13:53.840
to process what they've been learning
throughout the day.

13:53.920 --> 13:57.200
And I need you to help me
bring them up to speed.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.120
People look up to you.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.560
I can try…
…but I think I'm gonna struggle

14:03.640 --> 14:05.960
to get anybody around here
walking in single file.

14:06.880 --> 14:08.800
Excuse me. Hi.

14:08.880 --> 14:10.000
Hi.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.720
Jackson's gonna walk you through
some of the new school values.

14:12.800 --> 14:13.720
Oh.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.760
This should be fun.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.120
Hey.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.040
Hi.

14:21.160 --> 14:22.520
Are you taking the bus?

14:29.400 --> 14:30.720
You all right, Adam?

14:33.440 --> 14:34.760
Is there something you need?

14:35.800 --> 14:36.640
Yeah.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.360
I was wondering, um, if…

14:41.040 --> 14:42.480
I mean, whether you…

14:44.640 --> 14:46.760
Uh, actually, never mind.
Uh, it's nothing.

14:47.880 --> 14:51.320
Remember, I… I'm here
if you need any help with anything.

14:53.120 --> 14:53.960
Yep.

14:56.240 --> 14:57.440
What's this line really about?

14:57.520 --> 15:00.000
Guess it is annoying
when people run in the corridor.

15:00.080 --> 15:03.680
It's from a Scandinavian school model
about creating unity on campus.

15:03.760 --> 15:04.600
Okay.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.320
Apparently, quieter corridors
equal better grades across the board.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.880
And Hope's last school
achieved 90% A to A-Star rating,

15:09.960 --> 15:12.840
so I'm not complaining.
I've been researching her.

15:12.920 --> 15:16.520
This line is not about unity.
It's about control.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.840
We're going to be put into
tiny little boxes.

15:18.920 --> 15:21.680
-I think it's just a line.
-Nothing is ever just a line.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.240
Please keep to the left. Thanks.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.280
Oh, Maeve,
no facial piercings allowed, I'm afraid.

15:29.920 --> 15:30.760
Why?

15:30.840 --> 15:33.880
You won't wear a nose ring
when working at a top law firm, will you?

15:33.960 --> 15:36.520
School's meant
to prepare you for the real world,

15:36.600 --> 15:37.920
and from what I've heard,

15:38.000 --> 15:41.200
you're a very smart girl,
so let's be a team player.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.560
That's the best pair of titties
I ever drew.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.680
You're not gonna paint over
the Wall of Cock?

15:48.760 --> 15:49.680
Pardon?

15:50.200 --> 15:53.400
Sorry. It's a wall at the back of school
where people draw genitals.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.680
Ah, yes.
I remember it from my own time here.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.640
-Have they not painted over that?
-No.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.480
Oh, I'm Vivienne Odusanya.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.840
Great name, Vivienne.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.720
I'll have the wall painted
in the next couple days.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.240
-Oh, we can do that.
-What?

16:06.320 --> 16:07.680
We'd love to help paint it.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.480
Okay. Fantastic.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.280
Thanks, Vivienne.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.080
What did you do that for?

16:18.640 --> 16:19.480
Viv!

16:29.600 --> 16:30.600
Hello.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.480
Actually, would you stand opposite me?
I have misophonia.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.760
What is that?

16:39.840 --> 16:42.400
It's a phobia
of the sound of other people eating.

16:46.160 --> 16:48.240
-She can still hear you.

16:51.880 --> 16:52.760
Fuck me.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.840
Right, what's goin' on with you?

17:03.480 --> 17:06.600
You can't actually be okay
with them being a couple. It's impossible.

17:06.680 --> 17:09.720
I'm okay with it.
I think they're sort of perfect together.

17:12.840 --> 17:14.200
I think I like someone else.

17:15.080 --> 17:17.240
Isaac? It is, isn't it?

17:17.320 --> 17:18.800
I knew it!

17:18.880 --> 17:21.160
You're always talking about him.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.000
Isaac this, Isaac that.

17:23.080 --> 17:26.320
-Isaac, Isaac, Isaac.
-Stop, shush!

17:26.400 --> 17:28.640
Yes, it's Isaac, but I'm confused

17:28.720 --> 17:32.280
because we got really close as friends,
and I don't wanna ruin that.

17:32.920 --> 17:35.160
Well, I think you've got nothing to lose.

17:35.240 --> 17:39.320
And if it all goes tits up,
you've still got me and my flappies.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.320
Yeah.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.040
Aimes, this is amazing.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.040
-I've been practicing!
-Mmm.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.160
But all the flour,
it's making me constipated.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.280
Last week,
I didn't do a shit for five days.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.280
Then when I finally did do a poo,

17:53.360 --> 17:56.680
it was like my bum had
this gigantic orgasm.

17:57.400 --> 18:00.400
-Oh, it was great.
-Your stories are so special, Aimes.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.040
I can't believe I'm painting a wall

18:11.120 --> 18:12.400
so you can suck up to a teacher.

18:12.480 --> 18:14.920
This wall is vulgar.
You're doing a good thing.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.360
Loads of art is vulgar, Viv.
Picasso, obsessed with dicks and vaginas.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.640
This is not Picasso. This is graffiti.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.560
Who's to say
what's art and what isn't?

18:23.640 --> 18:24.920
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.880
I know her. Well, I mean,
she bumped into me the other day.

18:27.960 --> 18:31.720
My pronouns are they/them,
but no worries. I'm Cal.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.560
You can't paint over this wall.
It's history.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.240
It's a wall of penises.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.760
Okay, but not just any penises.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.840
It's a wall of historical penises.

18:43.440 --> 18:47.720
Like, look.
This one, this was drawn in 1985.

18:47.800 --> 18:52.240
And this lovely little scrote right here,
1990!

18:52.320 --> 18:55.560
We weren't even born, and you're trying
to paint over it like it's nothing.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.240
Maybe we shouldn't do this.

18:58.760 --> 19:00.040
You're head boy, right?

19:00.640 --> 19:03.640
If you really care,
you should make your case.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.880
I'm gonna go talk to Hope.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.520
Uh!

19:20.600 --> 19:22.320
Uh!

19:22.400 --> 19:23.320
Colin!

19:23.920 --> 19:24.920
Glad I caught you.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.280
Oh, sorry.
Am I on the wrong side of the line?

19:27.360 --> 19:29.520
I'm still trying to get used to it.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.520
No.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.320
I wanted to talk about
your song choices for the choir.

19:34.400 --> 19:38.360
Well, the students choose their own songs.
It's, uh, it's all part of the fun.

19:38.440 --> 19:42.440
Yes, but in the wake
of all the bad press we've been getting,

19:42.520 --> 19:46.640
I don't think students singing
about "sucking titties" is entirely wise.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.720
Do you?

19:48.920 --> 19:51.160
No, I guess not.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.600
I… I'll try and tone it down.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.120
I'll have my assistant send over
some suggestions

19:56.200 --> 19:58.560
for more appropriate song choices.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.320
-Great chat, Colin.
-Okay.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.040
Fuck off.

20:23.440 --> 20:26.000
Huh! How you doing?
What are you doing here, pal?

20:26.080 --> 20:27.160
-Huh?

20:27.880 --> 20:29.040
What?

20:30.240 --> 20:35.400
I'm early, uh,
for… for a meeting at my new job.

20:36.440 --> 20:37.680
So I thought I'd park here.

20:38.800 --> 20:40.480
Why not?

20:42.240 --> 20:43.120
Cool.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.160
So what's she like? The new headmistress?

20:47.240 --> 20:51.000
Different. She's got a lot of ideas
of how to change the place.

20:51.080 --> 20:55.120
Not to make it better.
Just, uh, different, really.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.360
Well, I better get to…
…my new job,

21:00.440 --> 21:01.960
and I don't want to be late.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.040
Well,

21:03.920 --> 21:05.240
new job awaits.

21:07.040 --> 21:08.200
Yeah. Um…

21:10.400 --> 21:13.480
Uh. Uh.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.400
Cool. Michael, me and you,
we should hang out.

21:17.000 --> 21:21.320
I know we weren't besties or anything,
but if you need to talk, I'm here, man.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.200
Oh, that's very kind, Colin.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.120
Thank you.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.400
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.400
Yeah, take care. Good to see you.

21:43.120 --> 21:45.960
You forgot your bag!
You don't need your bag?

21:46.880 --> 21:48.040
Please leave.

21:48.680 --> 21:50.480
Good luck!

22:11.400 --> 22:12.240
-Terrible.
-Hm?

22:12.320 --> 22:15.920
I'm not allowed to chew!
And I hate this top!

22:16.000 --> 22:19.800
Eric, it's hot and tight and very hot!

22:19.880 --> 22:22.120
Why am I carrying this thing?
She's not here!

22:22.200 --> 22:24.720
Okay, you know you don't have to do
these things, right?

22:24.800 --> 22:28.120
Yes, I do if I want to keep having
super amazing casual sex.

22:28.200 --> 22:31.880
And I know that that sounds bad,
but the sex is so good.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.160
-Oh.

22:34.240 --> 22:36.120
OT. Bag!

22:37.600 --> 22:39.560
-Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.920
What has she done to you?

22:46.640 --> 22:47.600
Eesh!

22:48.400 --> 22:51.680
So you plan to co-parent
without getting back together?

22:51.760 --> 22:53.840
Yes, that's the plan.

22:53.920 --> 22:55.200
We know that it's

22:56.080 --> 22:57.680
an unusual situation.

22:57.760 --> 23:00.800
May I ask what made you break off
the relationship before?

23:01.960 --> 23:03.760
Oh, it was a number of things.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.320
Jean kissed her ex-husband.

23:06.280 --> 23:07.240
I see.

23:07.760 --> 23:11.280
I made a mistake that I apologized for.

23:11.360 --> 23:15.400
I found the sudden presence
of a partner in my life,

23:15.480 --> 23:19.960
in my space, every day, difficult.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.360
Like, uh, my coins--

23:23.440 --> 23:24.880
Loose change…

23:24.960 --> 23:26.280
-…everywhere.
-…everywhere.

23:26.960 --> 23:27.800
Annoying.

23:27.880 --> 23:28.840
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.680
So he ended things.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.000
A decision that I completely respect.

23:35.720 --> 23:37.080
Is it what you wanted?

23:38.600 --> 23:41.640
No. I wanted to try again.

23:42.160 --> 23:44.240
Is that why you decided to keep this baby?

23:44.320 --> 23:46.680
-No. Absolutely not.
-No.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.520
I had discovered
I was pregnant quite late on.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.600
I really didn't know
what I was going to do.

23:54.760 --> 23:56.520
Anyway, after a while, I

23:57.560 --> 24:00.160
started to feel
that it was something that I might want,

24:00.240 --> 24:02.160
which was surprising.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.440
My son is
in his final year of school, and…

24:06.880 --> 24:07.960
to be honest,

24:09.200 --> 24:12.200
I don't think I'm ready to let go
of being a full-time mum.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.960
I think I'm good at it.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.520
And also, well, this may sound stupid, but

24:20.280 --> 24:23.440
I'm 48, and he's had a vasectomy,

24:24.480 --> 24:25.960
so it just seemed…

24:27.800 --> 24:28.640
Fated?

24:35.200 --> 24:36.040
Yeah.

24:40.840 --> 24:41.880
Anyway…

24:46.760 --> 24:49.400
Being an older parent is intimidating.

24:51.360 --> 24:54.000
I've found that, and so…

24:55.400 --> 24:59.400
I want Jakob to be involved
in any way that he can.

25:01.960 --> 25:02.880
Well,

25:04.280 --> 25:07.360
I think
you both still care about each other,

25:07.440 --> 25:10.160
but you weren't dating
for very long beforehand,

25:10.240 --> 25:13.080
so in some ways, you're still strangers.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.520
You haven't had time to build up
that foundation of trust,

25:16.600 --> 25:19.680
which you are going to need
to be co-parents.

25:19.760 --> 25:23.400
I'm gonna give you some homework
to help you move forwards.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.880
Okay.

25:28.520 --> 25:29.520
Aimee!

25:30.560 --> 25:33.280
Hey! I'm going to the gym.
Do you want to come to mine later?

25:33.360 --> 25:36.040
Oh! I can't tonight.
I'm hanging with Maeve.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.480
Yeah, I'm sorry to steal her, Steve.

25:39.560 --> 25:41.080
Okay. Maybe tomorrow?

25:41.160 --> 25:43.760
Mm, yeah. Ooh, oh, tomorrow!

25:44.720 --> 25:47.840
What was that about? I'm seeing
Elsie's new foster family tonight.

25:47.920 --> 25:51.200
I know, I know, but he keeps trying
to kiss and cuddle me.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.000
He doesn't mean to put pressure on me,

25:53.080 --> 25:56.680
but sometimes he gets this hungry look
in his eyes, and I just wanna scream,

25:56.760 --> 25:58.880
"No, Steve, I don't wanna have sex!"

26:00.080 --> 26:02.040
I used to really like sex,

26:02.120 --> 26:04.920
and I still wank a lot when I'm on my own,
but I don't know.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.120
I just feel safer when I'm by myself.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.880
How long has this been going on for?

26:08.960 --> 26:10.000
Since the bus.

26:11.840 --> 26:14.280
You might need to talk
to someone professional, Aimes.

26:14.840 --> 26:18.160
Do you think I can find someone
like Otis's mum? She seemed nice.

26:19.920 --> 26:20.960
Yeah.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.760
Hi, Otis.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

26:24.880 --> 26:26.880
Ruby picked this out for me.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.840
I didn't ask, but cool.

26:29.360 --> 26:32.640
We're still casual,
but I wanted to try something new.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.080
Casual doesn't seem like you.

26:36.200 --> 26:39.680
Anyway, Aimee is still struggling
after last term, and I'm…

26:40.720 --> 26:43.160
I'm worried about her.
She needs to talk to someone.

26:44.000 --> 26:46.120
I wondered maybe
if she could talk to your mum?

26:47.120 --> 26:49.120
-Sorry if it's weird to ask.
-No!

26:49.200 --> 26:50.720
No, Maeve, of course.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.760
-Really?
-Yeah, I'll… I'll chat to her.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.680
Thanks.

26:56.680 --> 27:00.120
What did you mean,
"Casual doesn't seem like me"?

27:02.040 --> 27:04.360
I don't know,
just the whole no-feelings thing.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.000
You used to care a lot.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.920
Things are easier when you don't care.

27:11.880 --> 27:12.880
Nobody gets hurt.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.280
Yeah.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.120
Anyway, thanks, Otis. Gotta go.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.440
We're going to hang at yours.

28:03.680 --> 28:07.600
So I have bought crisps,

28:08.800 --> 28:10.440
and some ham,

28:11.040 --> 28:13.840
and some more crisps. I panicked.

28:13.920 --> 28:16.520
-Are we here to have dinner?
-I don't know!

28:16.600 --> 28:19.960
It's what they do in films.
It's supposed to be romantic, isn't it?

28:24.280 --> 28:25.880
I think I'm a bit scared.

28:27.160 --> 28:28.280
You don't want to anymore?

28:28.360 --> 28:30.280
No. No, no, no. I do. I really do.

28:30.360 --> 28:34.800
It's just, I… I'm worried
that I don't know what I'm doing.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.760
Well, I don't know either.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.520
Don't worry.
I douched before school.

29:07.360 --> 29:08.280
Uh…

29:09.320 --> 29:10.240
What's wrong?

29:10.320 --> 29:14.680
I, uh, I don't--
This… this isn't what I want. I…

29:16.080 --> 29:17.000
You…

29:18.480 --> 29:19.800
don't wanna have sex with me.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.320
-Otis was right.
-Otis? What do you mean?

29:26.120 --> 29:28.120
He said that you would change your mind.

29:29.040 --> 29:31.200
That you weren't comfortable
with yourself.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.120
That this would be too gay for you.

29:33.200 --> 29:36.840
Look, I understand that you're not ready
to tell your mum, but…

29:38.440 --> 29:40.760
if you're not all in,
then I can't be with you.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.360
Well?

29:47.640 --> 29:48.600
Say something!

29:48.680 --> 29:50.120
It's just-- I don't-- It's--

29:51.120 --> 29:53.520
-This isn't what I want.
-Fuck's sake.

29:58.160 --> 30:01.520
Excuse me, please. Get off. Get off it!

30:01.600 --> 30:03.240
Ridiculous young man!

30:05.440 --> 30:06.480
Ridiculous.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.560
I think
he's pretending to go to work,

30:16.640 --> 30:18.400
which is just so humiliating.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.120
I know you feel bad for him,

30:20.200 --> 30:21.680
but he's been with us for weeks now.

30:21.760 --> 30:23.080
It's time for him to go.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.200
Okay, I'll tell him. Promise.

30:25.280 --> 30:26.280
When, Peter?

30:27.400 --> 30:29.280
-Tonight.
-Peter, I'm back!

30:29.360 --> 30:30.800
Gotta go, he's here.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.320
Hey, Michaela! How's work, champ?

30:34.400 --> 30:35.600
Uh…

30:35.680 --> 30:36.520
Great, yes.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.080
-Very good.
-Great.

30:38.160 --> 30:39.680
Lots to do already. Very happy.

30:41.520 --> 30:43.520
-Look--
-I've got some good news.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.200
I've found a flat to move into, so…

30:47.120 --> 30:48.040
Oh.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.680
Thank fuck for that!

30:50.760 --> 30:54.840
I was gonna ask you to move out.
I didn't want to because it's so awkward.

30:54.920 --> 30:58.520
But, uh, that's fucking brilliant news!
When are you leaving?

31:00.960 --> 31:03.080
Peter, what's he saying?

31:10.280 --> 31:11.240
Christ.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.680
-Maeve.
-Anna.

31:14.760 --> 31:17.640
Lovely to meet you. You're so pretty!

31:18.240 --> 31:20.800
Come in. We're playing tea parties
with Elsie's dollies.

31:20.880 --> 31:21.960
Wanna give us a hand?

31:30.040 --> 31:31.680
Shall we have some cake?

31:32.600 --> 31:34.240
Would you like a cup of tea?

31:34.880 --> 31:36.040
What about some…

31:36.120 --> 31:37.280
Hi, Elsie.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.040
-Maeve!
-Hello!

31:39.120 --> 31:41.800
Ooh! I missed you!

31:41.880 --> 31:43.680
-I missed you.

31:49.160 --> 31:51.160
-Yes.
-No.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.520
-Yes.
-No.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.840
-Oh yes! Yes!
-No.

31:58.640 --> 31:59.800
-Yes.
-No.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.240
-Yes.
-No.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.840
-Yes!
-No!

32:06.240 --> 32:08.720
-Now!
-Yes!

32:10.080 --> 32:12.200
-Fuck!

32:12.280 --> 32:13.960
-Ah!

32:22.560 --> 32:25.880
So tomorrow is purple day.
We all have to wear something purple.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.600
-I don't have anything purple.
-I left something out for you.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.360
You what?

32:35.280 --> 32:37.040
Don't you wanna hang out for a bit?

32:37.120 --> 32:40.720
Uh, my mum's working,
so I'm making dinner for my dad.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.840
He finds it hard to cook now.
It's fine though!

32:44.840 --> 32:46.240
Want me to come and help?

32:47.480 --> 32:48.960
Did you wanna have sex again?

32:49.040 --> 32:52.400
No, just thought
you might want some help with your dad.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.120
I'm fine.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.760
I'll see you tomorrow.

33:11.440 --> 33:12.520
You leaving, Ruby?

33:13.560 --> 33:14.560
Hi.

33:14.640 --> 33:16.200
That's Jakob, my, uh…

33:16.800 --> 33:19.160
-The…
-We're gonna be co-parents.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.880
You're a good-looking couple,
for old people.

33:23.480 --> 33:24.880
We're not exactly a couple!

33:24.960 --> 33:28.120
Who is this rude person?

33:28.200 --> 33:30.560
Otis's lover, apparently.

33:31.360 --> 33:36.720
Right, "I See You" is an exercise
where you stare into each other's eyes

33:36.800 --> 33:39.640
and articulate the emotions that come up.

33:39.720 --> 33:40.960
Oh, this is dumb.

33:41.040 --> 33:42.680
Come on. Let's be serious.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.480
Okay. Okay.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.200
Right, knees touching.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.160
-You blinked.
-Stop it.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.680
-Come on. Come on.

33:56.280 --> 33:58.080
-Knees to knees. Come on. You can do it.
-Yeah.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.920
Focus, focus, focus. All right.

34:00.840 --> 34:02.520
-Okay.

34:23.880 --> 34:26.200
So what emotions are coming up for you?

34:26.280 --> 34:30.400
That this is a stupid exercise,
and I really wanna kiss you.

34:54.120 --> 34:54.960
Hello.

34:55.560 --> 34:56.880
We need to talk, New Kid.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.160
Would you like some tea?

35:09.240 --> 35:10.800
No, I don't want any tea.

35:12.640 --> 35:15.000
I want you to stop talking shit
to my boyfriend.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.760
Did you and Eric have a fight?

35:22.560 --> 35:23.640
Yes.

35:24.640 --> 35:25.720
No.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.000
Sort of.

35:29.800 --> 35:32.040
You told him I'm not properly gay,
and now he's angry

35:32.120 --> 35:34.080
because he thinks
I don't wanna have sex with him.

35:34.640 --> 35:37.800
I never said you're not "properly gay."

35:38.800 --> 35:43.200
I said I want Eric to be careful
because you've hurt him in the past,

35:43.280 --> 35:44.320
and I'm worried.

35:45.960 --> 35:48.200
You should be talking to him
about this, not me.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.760
Tried talking. Doesn't come out right.

35:52.440 --> 35:53.600
What do you mean?

36:02.440 --> 36:04.560
I don't know how to say what I'm thinking.

36:05.640 --> 36:07.360
All the words are there in my head.

36:07.440 --> 36:11.840
I just don't know how to say
the thing that I want to say.

36:12.360 --> 36:15.080
The more I think about it,
the worse it gets.

36:15.640 --> 36:18.880
People are just looking at me,
waiting for me to say something, so…

36:20.400 --> 36:22.200
So I don't say anything at all.

36:23.200 --> 36:26.680
People think I'm scary or stupid.

36:28.360 --> 36:29.760
Why do you find it so hard?

36:32.040 --> 36:33.840
I didn't grow up in a naked family.

36:34.840 --> 36:35.880
What's a naked family?

36:35.960 --> 36:39.000
You know, those families
where everyone walks around naked,

36:39.080 --> 36:40.680
talking about how they feel.

36:41.480 --> 36:43.800
Like you and your mum.
Bet you're naked all the time.

36:44.320 --> 36:45.240
We are not.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.720
Do you think your family--

36:49.800 --> 36:52.280
I'm not here
to do your weird therapy thing.

36:52.360 --> 36:56.000
I just want you to stop talking about me
to Eric. It's none of your business.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.600
I will stay out of it.

36:59.960 --> 37:03.600
Sometimes, it helps
to write down what you want to say first.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.680
I'm not good at writing.

37:05.760 --> 37:08.600
Or you can ask the other person
to close their eyes

37:08.680 --> 37:09.880
whilst you talk to them.

37:09.960 --> 37:10.920
Sounds stupid.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.080
What I'm saying is,

37:12.160 --> 37:15.960
it might help you think more clearly
about what you want to say

37:16.040 --> 37:17.920
if you don't feel observed.

37:18.760 --> 37:20.120
It's just a suggestion.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.200
I'm going now.

37:24.120 --> 37:26.000
You should wear your normal clothes again.

37:28.840 --> 37:31.160
That top makes your neck look very long.

37:33.520 --> 37:36.600
-Oh, that was a bad idea.

37:36.680 --> 37:37.800
Yeah.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.080
Probably was.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.400
Well, Dr. Cutton is right.

37:45.320 --> 37:49.200
We do care about each other,
and that can be confusing.

37:50.240 --> 37:51.840
But we're adults, and…

37:53.840 --> 37:55.080
we won't let that happen again.

37:55.680 --> 37:57.960
I think we more than care for each other.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.720
What are you saying?

38:00.640 --> 38:02.400
I think we should be a family.

38:04.680 --> 38:08.320
But she also said
that we barely know each other.

38:08.400 --> 38:10.600
I don't care what the therapist said.

38:10.680 --> 38:13.840
I think we should be a family, Jean.

38:26.200 --> 38:27.960
Are you still at school, Maeve?

38:28.040 --> 38:28.920
Mm-hmm.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.360
I'm in my final year.

38:30.440 --> 38:33.080
Well done, you. That's a big achievement.

38:33.160 --> 38:35.360
Why? Because Mum's a junkie?

38:36.840 --> 38:39.200
No, it's a big achievement for anyone.

38:39.280 --> 38:40.280
Mm-hmm.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.360
And I understand
you don't have a lot of support at home.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.520
Are you in some kind of positivity cult?

38:46.080 --> 38:46.920
No.

38:48.040 --> 38:50.240
It helps
when the social workers come round.

38:50.320 --> 38:51.320
Uh-huh.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.440
You've got a lot of books.

38:54.520 --> 38:57.520
Yes, I teach literature part-time.

38:58.040 --> 39:00.840
You can never be lonely
with the company of a good book.

39:04.240 --> 39:05.840
You can borrow that if you like.

39:07.960 --> 39:08.960
No, thanks.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.960
When's my mum gonna be able
to come and see Elsie?

39:14.040 --> 39:17.080
She should be here now.
Does she run late often?

39:17.160 --> 39:18.240
Sorry. My mum's coming here?

39:18.320 --> 39:20.280
Yeah, this is a family visit.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.640
-I assumed you two would've spoken.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.640
-Hello, Erin.
-Fuck.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.520
Oh, it's lovely to meet you.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.200
-Can I come in or what?

39:31.600 --> 39:33.680
Where's my baby girl?

39:33.760 --> 39:35.720
-Mummy!

39:39.160 --> 39:40.240
Hi, Mum.

39:40.880 --> 39:44.760
What's she doing here? She's the reason
Elsie's in this happy-clappy shithole.

39:44.840 --> 39:47.120
-Not with me, her flesh and blood.
-That's rude, Mum.

39:47.200 --> 39:50.520
Rude? I'll tell you what's rude.
Calling the police on your own mother.

39:50.600 --> 39:51.640
That's rude.

39:51.720 --> 39:54.320
Okay. I think
I'm gonna come back another day.

39:54.400 --> 39:57.280
Yeah, you do that.
Nobody wants you here. Bye-bye. Bye.

39:57.840 --> 40:00.200
-I love you so much!

40:10.680 --> 40:11.760
Mm.

40:21.760 --> 40:22.640
Hm.

40:38.080 --> 40:39.360
-Hi.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.200
Ah, don't worry about him.
He's out like a light.

40:48.720 --> 40:50.440
How was Elsie's new place?

40:52.440 --> 40:55.880
I'm not sure about the foster lady.
She's a bit of a know-it-all, but…

40:56.800 --> 40:57.720
it was nice.

40:58.360 --> 41:00.120
Until my mum turned up
and told me to get out,

41:00.200 --> 41:02.440
which was less nice.

41:03.120 --> 41:04.120
Shit.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.560
Yeah, it was pretty shit.

41:06.600 --> 41:11.040
Do you want a hug?
Mine are notoriously terrible, but still.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.160
Yeah, all right.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.320
-I'm sure your mum will--
-No.

41:19.400 --> 41:22.000
Let's not talk about it. It is what it is.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.480
He's disgusting.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.640
-Yeah.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.880
-I'm related to that.

41:48.440 --> 41:49.400
Wait.

41:50.240 --> 41:51.520
-Sorry.
-I…

41:52.320 --> 41:53.760
I've gotta tell you something.

41:54.920 --> 41:55.760
Okay.

41:58.600 --> 42:02.560
The night that your mum
and Elsie went with the police,

42:04.360 --> 42:05.880
that Otis guy came,

42:06.680 --> 42:08.200
and I didn't tell you.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.400
Okay.

42:13.960 --> 42:16.520
He said that he wanted to talk to you

42:17.040 --> 42:20.160
and that he left a message on your phone,

42:20.240 --> 42:22.240
but you'd… you'd gone to the shops.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.000
And…

42:25.880 --> 42:29.000
I listened to the message.

42:31.400 --> 42:33.200
And I deleted it.

42:37.000 --> 42:37.840
Okay.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.080
What did the message say?

42:43.160 --> 42:44.240
Um…

42:45.360 --> 42:48.880
Something about him
still having feelings for you

42:49.680 --> 42:52.960
and that he felt like
he'd messed things up.

42:53.720 --> 42:54.720
He said,

42:55.320 --> 42:56.480
"Call me back

42:57.880 --> 42:59.280
if it wasn't too late."

43:06.160 --> 43:07.560
Can you say something, please?

43:08.880 --> 43:10.520
Elsie left weeks ago.

43:11.640 --> 43:13.480
I… I didn't know how to tell you.

43:16.400 --> 43:17.960
It's not an excuse, but…

43:19.280 --> 43:20.400
I was angry

43:21.040 --> 43:22.840
at all the shit that you dealt with.

43:22.920 --> 43:25.800
I don't think Otis understands it at all.

43:26.880 --> 43:28.920
The way that he treated you at that party.

43:29.000 --> 43:31.560
He said that you were a selfish person,

43:32.240 --> 43:35.840
and you are
the least selfish person I know.

43:35.920 --> 43:37.520
So you went into my private property.

43:37.600 --> 43:39.280
I'm a dick, I know, but…

43:41.760 --> 43:44.200
…I was doing it
because I was trying to protect you.

43:46.080 --> 43:47.000
You're right.

43:47.960 --> 43:49.560
Otis doesn't understand me.

43:52.680 --> 43:53.720
But neither do you.

43:54.760 --> 43:57.480
Because if you did,
you'd know that I don't trust anyone.

43:58.960 --> 44:00.280
But I trusted you,

44:02.200 --> 44:03.480
and that was special…

44:06.280 --> 44:07.720
and you've messed it up.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.240
People make mistakes.

44:12.680 --> 44:15.120
-Like your mum. She--
-Don't talk to me about my mum.

44:20.080 --> 44:21.720
Can't believe
I thought you were different.

44:48.080 --> 44:49.080
Come on.

45:00.640 --> 45:02.520
What do you wanna talk to me about?

45:03.240 --> 45:04.200
I, uh…

45:07.600 --> 45:08.720
I've…

45:12.080 --> 45:13.960
Adam, it's late…

45:15.120 --> 45:16.080
I'm sorry.

45:27.680 --> 45:31.520
I wanna tell you how I feel,
but I don't want you to look at me.

45:34.720 --> 45:35.720
Okay.

45:48.000 --> 45:51.240
I… don't want to have sex with you.

45:54.160 --> 45:57.640
I want you to have sex with me.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.920
I don't understand
what you're saying, Adam.

46:10.560 --> 46:12.280
I want you to put your dick in me.

46:16.160 --> 46:17.920
That's how I would like to do it.

46:29.880 --> 46:31.400
Can you turn around, please?

46:38.840 --> 46:41.000
I would love to put my dick in you.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.160
-Adam.
-Hm?

47:24.480 --> 47:25.560
I think you should go

47:25.640 --> 47:27.640
before my parents see
you stayed the night.

47:45.520 --> 47:46.720
He has to work.

47:46.800 --> 47:50.360
Yes, I know. He works very hard. Mm-hmm.

47:50.440 --> 47:53.880
Eric! Come in here!
Your grandma's on the phone.

47:53.960 --> 47:56.200
-Coming!

47:56.280 --> 47:59.320
-Yes, I know.
-Who's got my highlighter? Who's got it?

47:59.400 --> 48:01.560
Your cousin Shukpo is getting married.

48:01.640 --> 48:04.280
Your grandmother wants us
all to go to Nigeria for the wedding.

48:04.360 --> 48:05.880
Ooh! Oh!

48:05.960 --> 48:07.240
What about school?

48:07.320 --> 48:09.080
-You'll only be gone a week.
-Okay--

48:09.160 --> 48:11.960
Remember,
she doesn't know anything about Adam.

48:12.960 --> 48:15.600
-She's too frail for that.
-Okay.

48:17.120 --> 48:19.400
Hello, Grandma! How are you?

48:48.960 --> 48:49.800
Michael.

48:50.760 --> 48:51.640
Colin.

48:53.680 --> 48:55.440
I need somewhere to stay for a bit.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.520
Sure, man.

49:14.280 --> 49:17.880
No, no. Nope, nope, nope, nope.

49:28.240 --> 49:29.160
Hello, darling!

49:30.120 --> 49:34.840
-Good morning.
-Have a seat. I made eggs.

49:37.080 --> 49:39.720
What's going on?
Last time you made eggs was when Dad left.

49:46.600 --> 49:49.120
Jakob and I have done some talking.

49:49.200 --> 49:50.240
-And…
-Mm-hmm.

49:50.320 --> 49:54.440
…we think it would be best
for the new baby and…

49:55.600 --> 49:58.880
for us, and for everyone, really,

49:59.520 --> 50:01.880
that we try and make this work properly.

50:03.840 --> 50:04.960
As a family.

50:05.560 --> 50:06.480
Which means?

50:07.440 --> 50:11.520
That I want Jakob and Ola

50:11.600 --> 50:13.120
to move in with us.

50:14.480 --> 50:18.840
I know that's a lot to take in,
and if it doesn't feel right for you,

50:20.160 --> 50:21.840
we'll find another way, but…

50:23.880 --> 50:25.600
I think it could be good.

50:31.840 --> 50:32.920
Okay.

50:36.400 --> 50:37.280
That's it?

50:37.880 --> 50:41.840
If this is what you wanna do, Mum,
then, yeah, I'm fine with it.

50:42.880 --> 50:45.400
I mean,
I'm not gonna be living at home forever.

50:47.520 --> 50:49.720
Thank you for being so adult.

50:58.720 --> 51:03.520
Mum, do you think
I'm a casual-relationships kinda guy?

51:03.600 --> 51:08.120
I think you're the sort of person
who wants meaningful connection.

51:08.760 --> 51:13.240
But I also think that it's good for you
to try different types of relationships.

51:16.680 --> 51:18.720
There's a friend of mine at school.

51:19.600 --> 51:22.760
She was sexually assaulted last term
and needs some help.

51:23.520 --> 51:26.680
I said I'd ask if you'd speak with her.
It's fine if you can't.

51:26.760 --> 51:28.760
I'd be honored to speak with her.

51:30.720 --> 51:31.640
Thanks, Mum.

51:43.560 --> 51:47.200
Um, hello! Why are you wearing
your homeless clothes again?

51:47.280 --> 51:49.800
Because these are my clothes, Ruby!

51:49.880 --> 51:52.960
I don't wanna have to change who I am
in order to hang out with you.

51:53.600 --> 51:58.440
But if you're really that embarrassed
of me, I guess we have to call it quits.

52:00.480 --> 52:03.160
People don't call it quits with me.

52:04.280 --> 52:06.280
They don't have to
if you always keep things casual.

52:07.960 --> 52:11.880
I would like to get to know you better
if you'd let me.

52:12.840 --> 52:13.720
Why?

52:14.240 --> 52:17.280
Because I think
you're an interesting person.

52:18.480 --> 52:19.800
I mean, you're terrifying…

52:21.160 --> 52:22.080
but interesting.

52:24.120 --> 52:26.000
Do you mean you want to be my boyfriend?

52:27.520 --> 52:29.120
Yeah, I guess so.

52:36.120 --> 52:39.800
I think I can probably make people think
this jacket is cool.

53:32.040 --> 53:32.960
Miss?

53:33.480 --> 53:34.440
Yeah?

53:36.040 --> 53:38.200
-Can I ask you something?
-Of course.

53:38.280 --> 53:39.160
Okay.

53:41.880 --> 53:42.840
Uh…

53:43.400 --> 53:44.400
Mm…

53:51.840 --> 53:53.080
I would like to be

53:54.000 --> 53:57.280
better at school, and… and maybe…

53:59.600 --> 54:01.840
not be in the bottom set anymore.

54:04.680 --> 54:06.280
Can you help me do that, please?

54:10.080 --> 54:11.640
Why are you turned around?

54:14.320 --> 54:15.600
It makes me think better.

54:18.680 --> 54:20.240
Okay.

54:20.320 --> 54:21.280
Sure, Adam.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.040
I can try and help you.

54:24.760 --> 54:27.720
But you must commit yourself.
I don't want to waste my time.

54:30.560 --> 54:31.400
Thanks, miss.

54:41.760 --> 54:43.440
Why is he not wearing purple?

54:43.520 --> 54:45.840
I think we should dress
how we want to from now on.

54:45.920 --> 54:48.440
Still cool and expensive, obviously.

54:50.320 --> 54:53.320
Shut the front door.

54:53.400 --> 54:54.920
It's my new look.

54:55.000 --> 54:56.280
I call it "Pimp on Fire."

54:56.360 --> 54:59.280
-You look great, Anwar.
-You look like you were dressed by a bin.

55:04.560 --> 55:05.400
Maeve.

55:05.960 --> 55:08.920
Hey, I spoke to my mum,
and she'll talk to Aimee.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.120
Thanks, Otis.
I appreciate that.

55:12.840 --> 55:16.360
And me and Ruby aren't casual anymore.
We're official.

55:21.600 --> 55:22.520
Hmm.

55:23.800 --> 55:26.240
Got you an appointment
with Jean Milburn.

55:27.000 --> 55:29.240
-It's a good start.
-That's great!

55:29.320 --> 55:30.160
Yeah.

55:30.680 --> 55:32.600
What if she thinks
I'm wobbly in the brain?

55:32.680 --> 55:34.280
She won't think that, Aimes.

55:36.120 --> 55:39.320
-So what's the news with Isaac?
-Changed my mind about that.

55:39.400 --> 55:41.520
-Why?
-Because you were right.

55:42.040 --> 55:43.560
Don't need a boy when I've got you.

55:47.080 --> 55:49.640
Maeve, why is your nose ring still in?

55:49.720 --> 55:52.280
Because I forgot to take it out. Sorry.

55:52.880 --> 55:53.920
Okay, hand it over.

55:55.160 --> 55:56.760
-Now?
-Yes, now.

56:00.480 --> 56:02.040
And don't make me ask again.

56:03.320 --> 56:06.440
Might start to think
you're not as smart as people say you are.

56:10.480 --> 56:11.320
Hey!

56:15.040 --> 56:17.080
-Jackson Marchetti has a crush?
-Reduce it.

56:17.160 --> 56:19.200
Jackson,
I just saw the wall isn't painted.

56:19.280 --> 56:21.200
Yes, I wanted to talk to you about that.

56:21.280 --> 56:23.240
As head boy,
I'd like to put my case forward

56:23.320 --> 56:26.040
for saving the Wall of Cock.
It's a piece of school history

56:26.120 --> 56:30.720
and a form of artistic expression that,
in my opinion, shouldn't be censored.

56:32.200 --> 56:33.720
What do you think, Vivienne?

56:34.960 --> 56:36.400
I think the wall should be painted.

56:36.480 --> 56:39.840
It's vulgar, immature, and doesn't
represent the school in the right way.

56:39.920 --> 56:41.240
-Yeah, but--
-I agree.

56:42.240 --> 56:43.720
Would you like Jackson's job?

56:43.800 --> 56:45.920
-Sure, absolutely, yes.
-Wait, what?

56:46.000 --> 56:48.120
Fantastic. You start today.

56:48.800 --> 56:52.880
This will give you lots more time
to focus on your artistic pursuits.

56:56.920 --> 57:00.200
You know it would look amazing
on my school CV. I couldn't say no.

57:31.040 --> 57:32.400
Hello, Moordale.

57:32.480 --> 57:36.040
School uniforms will be introduced
on campus from next week.

57:36.560 --> 57:39.480
They are compulsory,
and it's non-negotiable.

57:39.560 --> 57:40.880
I think my soul just died.

57:40.960 --> 57:44.400
We're also cracking down on jewelry,
piercings, hair dye,

57:44.480 --> 57:46.640
and any non-regulation uniform.

57:47.160 --> 57:50.640
Detentions will be given
if you do not abide by the rules.

57:50.720 --> 57:53.120
I told you, it's never just a line.
