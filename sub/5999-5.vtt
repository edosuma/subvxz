Charlie: <i>I underestimated you,</i>

00:03.383 --> 00:05.267
<i>but there's a kid</i> <i>in there.</i>

00:05.557 --> 00:08.726
He doesn't know his father screwed up.

00:08.777 --> 00:11.028
It feels like a girl.

00:11.062 --> 00:12.863
You can sack me. Off the project.

00:12.897 --> 00:14.865
- For what cause?
- <i> Truancy.</i>

00:14.899 --> 00:17.901
Whatever insults your
daughter suffered at my hands.

00:17.903 --> 00:19.729
Congratulations, Paul.

00:19.754 --> 00:22.206
I've decided you will
be the Site X liaison.

00:22.408 --> 00:23.991
What?

00:24.042 --> 00:27.161
Ah, W.D. Lorentzen.

00:27.212 --> 00:29.663
Oh, I see my reputation precedes me.

00:29.714 --> 00:31.465

Liza.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.764
Did they tell you anything about Frank?

00:34.789 --> 00:37.087
I've been hired to write
the official chronicle

00:37.138 --> 00:39.223
of the Manhattan Engineering District.

00:39.257 --> 00:42.259
It wasn't just a campus you
shared with Mr. Lorentzen.

00:42.261 --> 00:43.677
I wonder how your husband would feel

00:43.728 --> 00:45.596
about your recent visit with an old flame.

00:46.218 --> 00:48.265
Liza: <i>You say you love Callie?</i>

00:48.316 --> 00:50.017
This is quite a way of showing it.

00:50.068 --> 00:51.852
Crystal City, Texas.

00:51.903 --> 00:54.571
That's where they're keeping your husband.

00:54.606 --> 00:57.024
I can get you as far
as the Lamy train depot.

00:57.075 --> 00:58.776
Liza.

00:58.827 --> 01:01.111
Hi. How are you?

01:01.162 --> 01:03.697
I have to go back to the Hill.

01:03.748 --> 01:06.033
You just escaped from a prison.

01:06.084 --> 01:08.085
You want to break back into one?

01:14.292 --> 01:15.571
Frank.

01:16.462 --> 01:18.095
They told me...

01:18.129 --> 01:21.048
I thought you were dead.

01:23.051 --> 01:24.802
They lied.

01:30.358 --> 01:33.811
Frank: <i>Everything that
we've been fighting against,</i>

01:33.862 --> 01:36.697
racing Heisenberg's bomb to the finish,

01:36.731 --> 01:38.557
it's all science fiction.

01:39.319 --> 01:40.853
What is this?

01:41.536 --> 01:42.870
Charlie, just listen to me.

01:42.904 --> 01:47.074
The Magpie intelligence was all fabricated

01:47.125 --> 01:48.826
by our own government.

01:48.877 --> 01:51.461
They stole my math, they fed it back to us.

01:51.504 --> 01:53.600
What happened to you,
Frank? Where have you been?

01:53.625 --> 01:55.043
None of that matters. All that matters

01:55.077 --> 01:57.912
is that we have been chasing our own tail.

01:57.963 --> 02:01.082
Every single testing yield,
every differential equation.

02:01.133 --> 02:03.301
The Germans are ahead of us.

02:03.335 --> 02:06.387
They're accelerating. Magpie showed
us designs of a working gadget.

02:06.422 --> 02:09.424
No, God damn it. Listen.
There is no Nazi bomb.

02:09.475 --> 02:11.059
Period.

02:12.061 --> 02:14.395
The Army manipulated us.

02:20.102 --> 02:22.724
And you... you and I, Charlie.

02:23.322 --> 02:25.226
We have to stop this train.

02:33.949 --> 02:36.367
You're not thinking straight.

02:36.418 --> 02:38.419
I don't know what the hell happened to you,

02:38.454 --> 02:39.921
what you heard about the Germans...

02:39.955 --> 02:41.289
What I know about the Germans.

02:41.340 --> 02:43.291
Dozens of sites, thousands of workers,

02:43.342 --> 02:45.293
hundreds of millions of dollars.

02:45.344 --> 02:48.462
You think the government's just
gonna roll up our rug and head home?

02:49.206 --> 02:51.257
The gadget's an inevitability.

02:53.102 --> 02:55.803
You don't even care
that we've been lied to.

02:57.272 --> 02:58.763
Why?

02:59.274 --> 03:02.310
Because you finally got a

03:02.361 --> 03:04.479
<i>(Glass thuds)</i>

03:04.530 --> 03:07.065
There's a war on three continents

03:11.070 --> 03:13.014
I saved you.

03:13.405 --> 03:15.373
That was your choice.

03:24.716 --> 03:26.634
Are you okay?

03:28.253 --> 03:30.471
I... I'm not feeling very well.

03:30.506 --> 03:32.090
I think you should leave.

<i>(Dog barking)</i>

<i>They have</i> <i>a serious problem.</i>

03:51.443 --> 03:55.079
<i>This cat, see, is making</i>
<i>their life very difficult.</i>

03:55.114 --> 03:56.864
<i>So all the mice</i>
<i>gather together.</i>

03:56.915 --> 03:58.499

<i>how to handle the cat,</i>

03:58.534 --> 04:00.535

04:00.586 --> 04:02.170

<i>This is a good mouse,</i>
<i>a smart mouse.</i>

04:09.761 --> 04:11.546
<i>And his plan wins out.</i>

04:11.597 --> 04:15.266
<i>He gets a ribbon and
little bell all his own.</i>

04:15.300 --> 04:19.137
<i>Out he marches,</i>
<i>hero of all mice.</i>

04:19.188 --> 04:20.688
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>happened next?</i>

04:22.774 --> 04:24.629
The cat ate him up.

04:25.360 --> 04:28.365
Everyone on this hill's
gonna know about Magpie.

04:28.947 --> 04:30.698
That name...

04:30.732 --> 04:32.492
will never be spoken again.

04:32.517 --> 04:35.045
And what do you think will happen
when I tell "The New York Times"

04:35.070 --> 04:36.797
about what you put me through?

04:37.573 --> 04:39.540
You spent the past two months

04:39.575 --> 04:41.325
stationed at a secret location,

04:41.376 --> 04:43.578
hard at work, no time to write.

04:43.629 --> 04:45.830
But then, once again, you
ruffled the wrong feathers

04:45.881 --> 04:47.381
and they showed you the door.

04:47.416 --> 04:50.301
Boy, you are just full
of fables, aren't you?

04:50.335 --> 04:52.587
Your wife pulled Einstein's string

04:52.638 --> 04:54.388
and a bell rang in the White House.

04:54.423 --> 04:56.674
Now you're in my house, and in my house

04:56.725 --> 04:59.093

05:13.275 --> 05:16.027
What makes you think Isaacs won't talk now?

05:16.078 --> 05:18.996
Dr. Isaacs is, how would he put it,

05:19.031 --> 05:21.032

05:25.954 --> 05:27.669
Pick a hand, Dr. Winter.

07:02.684 --> 07:04.385
Fine.

07:04.436 --> 07:05.693
Fine, I'll go to Princeton

12:36.702 --> 12:38.670
(chuckles)

12:41.624 --> 12:43.708
So you heard from Callie?

12:43.760 --> 12:45.127
Thought we had a rule.

12:45.178 --> 12:47.429
Ah, I can't make the rules.

12:47.463 --> 12:49.631
You outrank me, remember?

12:51.017 --> 12:53.018
She hasn't sent a letter in a while.

12:53.052 --> 12:55.771
Read the last one about a billion times.

12:55.805 --> 12:57.689
She talks all about Montreal.

12:57.723 --> 13:00.358
She says the police ride horses.

13:00.393 --> 13:03.061
She always wanted to live in a big city.

13:05.231 --> 13:08.234
When I got here, I was the
loneliest guy on planet Earth.

13:08.451 --> 13:10.235
I hated it.

13:10.286 --> 13:12.954
The air's so dry and the people.

13:12.989 --> 13:14.790
It's like being smothered.

13:16.292 --> 13:18.376
But then I met your daughter.

13:20.329 --> 13:23.108
All of a sudden the air was
the cleanest air I ever smelled.

13:25.501 --> 13:27.969
I'd do anything to see her, sir.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.059
Lorentzen: <i>But it'll be a long
time till he sees Callie again,</i>

13:34.093 --> 13:35.977
<i>won't it?</i>

13:36.012 --> 13:38.897
- <i> (door opens)</i>
- Man: <i> Attention!</i>

13:46.105 --> 13:48.440
I've got happy news.

13:48.491 --> 13:51.243
Some of you lucky soldiers are
gonna be given the opportunity

13:51.277 --> 13:53.328
to take up arms overseas.

13:53.362 --> 13:55.363
<i>The following men report
to Lieutenant Dreidger</i>

13:55.414 --> 13:57.449
at 0800.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.669
Private Dobbs, Sergeant Salera,

14:00.703 --> 14:02.871
Lance Corporal Bondurant,

14:02.922 --> 14:04.907
Private Kaposi,

14:05.591 --> 14:08.543
and Private First Class Dunlavey.

14:09.295 --> 14:11.382
Good luck to you, gentlemen.

14:12.548 --> 14:15.717
- You're dismissed.
- (Cheering)

14:18.020 --> 14:19.804
They told me it would never happen.

14:19.856 --> 14:22.390
Finally something to write Callie about.

14:25.451 --> 14:27.479
Lorentzen: <i>He's in the rear
command of the Pacific?</i>

14:27.530 --> 14:29.898
Radio ops, yeah?

14:29.949 --> 14:32.367
Liza would know better than I would.

14:32.401 --> 14:34.119
She's better at writing.

14:34.153 --> 14:37.122
Dunlavey's the only
soldier he sent to Saipan.

14:37.156 --> 14:39.875
- Why do you think that is?
- (Knocks)

14:41.176 --> 14:42.676
Frank?

14:46.299 --> 14:49.050
Well, you're the man's
shill. Why don't you ask him?

14:52.305 --> 14:54.222
I think we're done here.

15:08.821 --> 15:10.071
Colonel Darrow!

15:12.358 --> 15:14.209
Saipan?

15:14.527 --> 15:16.111
Private Dunlavey enlisted

15:16.162 --> 15:18.163
to serve his country, Frank, just like you.

15:18.197 --> 15:20.999
You sent him to the bloodiest
theater in the goddamn war.

15:21.033 --> 15:23.118
I know how fond he is of you and your wife.

15:23.169 --> 15:24.920
I'm sure he'll write.

15:27.290 --> 15:30.792
When I give an order, I
expect it to be followed.

15:30.843 --> 15:33.845
No more late-night visits
to the medical clinic.

15:33.879 --> 15:36.131
What, you...

15:36.182 --> 15:38.967
you did this because I
went to visit my wife?

15:39.831 --> 15:42.165
You're dismissed, Private.

16:20.661 --> 16:21.795
<i>(Lock clicks)</i>

16:21.829 --> 16:24.915
And lastly, the arid climate

16:24.966 --> 16:26.416
can be very hard on an infant,

16:26.467 --> 16:29.135
so your baby may need
to feed more frequently.

16:29.170 --> 16:31.471
I was told there'd be formula.

16:33.591 --> 16:34.674
Um...

16:36.594 --> 16:40.347
Yes, infant formula needs to
be reconstituted with water

16:40.398 --> 16:43.683
and so I excluded it from
the packages as a precaution.

16:43.734 --> 16:46.102
<i>If you have any further questions?</i>

16:47.294 --> 16:48.878
Good afternoon, ladies.

16:48.903 --> 16:52.072
If your infant develops
a rash or trouble feeding,

16:52.097 --> 16:53.814
please contact a nurse.

16:55.279 --> 16:57.722
Abby, it's been a while.

16:57.747 --> 16:59.298
Are you here to see Dr. Adelman?

16:59.559 --> 17:01.227
No, um,

17:01.324 --> 17:03.119
one of the nurses told
me you were conducting

17:03.170 --> 17:04.788
a study on pregnancy.

17:04.839 --> 17:07.874
Looking at the health effects
of work in the tech area.

17:09.877 --> 17:12.712
Abby, I'm very sorry for
what you've been through.

17:12.762 --> 17:15.848
It's completely natural to want answers.

17:15.883 --> 17:17.684
Did you look at my file?

17:17.718 --> 17:20.159
I know there's something
they're not telling me.

17:20.605 --> 17:23.890
There were 127 pregnancies
on the Hill last year

17:23.941 --> 17:27.011
and only one late-term miscarriage.

17:27.478 --> 17:31.114
I'm not saying that the work on
the Hill has no effect on pregnancy,

17:31.148 --> 17:32.949
I'm just saying we have no evidence.

17:33.951 --> 17:35.534
So it's...

17:35.953 --> 17:38.038
an act of God?

17:40.791 --> 17:44.494
There isn't always a medical
explanation in these cases.

17:44.545 --> 17:47.213
If you need to talk to somebody...

17:51.135 --> 17:53.503
Talking is what got me here.

17:55.465 --> 17:59.207
<i>(Door opens, closes)</i>

17:59.310 --> 18:01.270
What, are you allergic
to newspaper reporters?

18:01.295 --> 18:02.562
He's not Edward R. Murrow.

18:02.596 --> 18:04.814
He's writing the official
history of the project.

18:04.849 --> 18:06.232
They'll probably make a movie about it.

18:06.267 --> 18:08.902
You wanna get left on
the cutting room floor?

18:08.936 --> 18:12.605
So you two whiz kids were members
of the original implosion team.

18:12.657 --> 18:15.659
The only two Charlie Isaacs
anointed for his test group.

18:15.693 --> 18:17.327
Well, Charlie's a great boss.

18:17.361 --> 18:19.245
I mean, sure, he works us hard,

18:19.280 --> 18:22.204
but if there's ever any
criticism, it's only constructive.

18:22.867 --> 18:24.584
He's got great hair, too. (chuckles)

18:24.618 --> 18:26.586
I wanna hear your thoughts
about another boss.

18:26.620 --> 18:28.838
Oppenheimer. That man
has been on a real roll

18:28.873 --> 18:30.173
since he had that second bambino.

18:30.207 --> 18:31.958
No, I wanna talk about Frank Winter.

18:33.344 --> 18:34.594
From my understanding,

18:34.628 --> 18:37.380
he torched every bridge from here to D.C.

18:37.431 --> 18:39.599
Even found time to dust off an old grudge.

18:39.633 --> 18:41.551
You mean the thing with Charlie?

18:41.602 --> 18:44.437
Yeah. Uh, November 17th?

18:46.515 --> 18:48.984
Can this be off the record?

18:49.009 --> 18:51.394
- Lorentzen: <i>My three favorite words.</i>
-<i> (Music playing on radio)</i>

18:51.445 --> 18:53.029
Charlie: It's historic!

18:53.064 --> 18:56.097
We could be looking at a
Browns-Cardinals showdown.

18:56.867 --> 19:00.153
It hasn't happened since 1922.

19:01.455 --> 19:02.789
Thank you, sir.

19:06.627 --> 19:08.294
Watch out.

19:09.497 --> 19:11.464
God, he almost ran me over.

19:11.499 --> 19:14.106
I'm telling you, Browns are gonna take it.

19:14.131 --> 19:15.528
- Smart money.
- Here's the thing.

19:15.553 --> 19:17.303
My father's a Browns fan,

19:17.338 --> 19:20.974
so I'd sooner root for
the Hitler Youth All Stars.

19:21.008 --> 19:23.676
Oh, but come on, two
teams from St. Louis...

19:23.728 --> 19:24.844
- Whoa!
- Hey!

19:24.895 --> 19:26.896
Jesus!

19:27.556 --> 19:29.055
Hello?

19:30.351 --> 19:32.628
You didn't believe me, huh? (laughs)

19:33.521 --> 19:36.239
Lazar! Uh, howdy!

19:36.273 --> 19:39.025
Uh, Fritz. Fedowitz.

19:39.076 --> 19:41.327
Your reputation precedes you, sir.

19:41.362 --> 19:44.280
- In a good way. It's an honor to...
- Tomorrow.

19:44.331 --> 19:46.833
- What?
- I'm sorry?

19:46.867 --> 19:49.452
You're late. We're gonna be
driving back on dirt roads

19:49.503 --> 19:51.121
in the middle of the night.

19:51.172 --> 19:53.423
Gonna get ourselves killed.
You come back tomorrow.

19:53.457 --> 19:55.291
Charlie: <i>Frank?</i>

19:55.342 --> 19:57.627
Meeks: <i>Hey, you're
working in Ordnance now?</i>

19:57.678 --> 19:59.045
Fritz: <i>How are you, Commandante?</i>

19:59.096 --> 20:02.632
Oh, you know, explosives, whiskey.

20:02.683 --> 20:05.685
- Just like old times.
- Yeah. I told them to go home.

20:05.719 --> 20:09.355
Construction starts tomorrow. We need to
confirm the spot for the derrick tonight.

20:09.390 --> 20:11.107
Come now or I tell General Groves

20:11.142 --> 20:13.026
that you refused the chance to weigh in.

20:13.060 --> 20:15.728
Well, the general doesn't
want me to weigh in.

20:15.780 --> 20:17.397
He wants me to decide.

20:17.448 --> 20:19.532
Then decide today.

20:22.820 --> 20:25.371
Well, it's your funeral.

20:25.406 --> 20:27.957
It's gonna be a tight fit.

20:29.660 --> 20:33.046
I was, uh... I was only
counting the four of us.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.215
Lazar: <i>Well, you counted wrong.</i>

20:43.199 --> 20:44.891
Lazar: <i>This is where
you're gonna put</i>

20:44.925 --> 20:47.510
the hundred-foot tower for your gadget?

20:47.561 --> 20:51.815
It's smack in the middle of the most
exposed part of the entire valley.

20:51.849 --> 20:53.766
Charlie: It's discreet, it's accessible,

20:53.818 --> 20:56.736
and it conforms best to our
specific technical needs.

20:56.770 --> 20:59.105
Oh, that's very, very good.

20:59.156 --> 21:01.024
Dear America,

21:01.075 --> 21:04.694
we're very, very sorry, but your
bomb blew away with the wind.

21:04.745 --> 21:09.115
But don't you worry, it conforms
best to our specific technical needs.

21:09.166 --> 21:12.001
- All right, why don't you just calm down?
- (Gunshot echoes)

21:13.120 --> 21:15.455
(horse neighs)

21:19.126 --> 21:21.261
(horse neighs)

21:21.295 --> 21:24.848
- You boys look like you're lost.
- The McDonoaugh brothers.

21:25.735 --> 21:27.634
You... you guys know each other?

21:30.721 --> 21:32.939
Trespassing on my family's property.

21:32.973 --> 21:35.692
This land's the property of
the United States government.

21:35.726 --> 21:38.478
You've ignored five requests
to appear before a judge.

21:38.529 --> 21:40.730
$2,400 is a fair price.

21:42.366 --> 21:44.117
This desert's a spooky place.

21:44.151 --> 21:46.202
<i>Indian country.</i>

21:46.237 --> 21:49.289
Your government men disappear
around here all the time.

21:49.323 --> 21:51.157
If I were you, I wouldn't issue threats.

21:51.208 --> 21:54.410
If I was you, I'd adios
myself back where I came from.

21:54.461 --> 21:57.380
- And if I don't?
- (Rifle cocks)

21:59.333 --> 22:02.502
Frank: <i>Gonna need a lot
more ammunition than that.</i>

22:02.553 --> 22:05.471
<i>You kill us, they'll
just send 10 more guys.</i>

22:05.506 --> 22:07.674
<i>Kill them, they'll send a hundred.</i>

22:07.725 --> 22:11.836
Army doesn't give two shits about
your family's property rights.

22:12.813 --> 22:15.181
You fellas are up against the Constitution.

22:15.232 --> 22:17.183
You fight it, you'll just
waste a few days in court,

22:17.234 --> 22:21.404
end up with the same $2,000
plus a stack of legal bills.

22:25.633 --> 22:27.384
But maybe

22:27.409 --> 22:30.294
your land here is worth
more than two grand.

22:30.698 --> 22:33.032
Hell, it may be worth a lot more.

22:35.002 --> 22:36.836
This canyon's part of the San Juan Basin,

22:36.870 --> 22:39.505
which is a proven oil reserve. Silver, too.

22:39.540 --> 22:42.091
<i>You ever done a geologic survey?</i>

22:42.126 --> 22:45.011
The feds don't have time to spend
in court debating mineral rights.

22:45.045 --> 22:47.213
What they have is money.

22:47.264 --> 22:48.881
A tap that never runs dry.

22:48.933 --> 22:50.767
You start saying oil and silver,

22:50.801 --> 22:52.385
you ask for five times the price.

22:52.436 --> 22:55.305
- You'll get double.
- Come on.

22:55.356 --> 22:57.307
He's right, Clem.

22:59.944 --> 23:02.111
- If you're wrong about this...
- I'm not wrong.

23:02.146 --> 23:04.030
That's the best you'll do.

23:13.374 --> 23:16.209
(Horse neighs)

23:18.963 --> 23:21.581
- Is that true?
- Hell, I got no idea.

23:21.632 --> 23:24.717
(All laughing)

23:24.752 --> 23:27.971
- Lazar: <i> Ha! He's good.</i>
- Hey, I didn't ask for your help.

23:28.005 --> 23:29.672
You came back to the Hill

23:29.723 --> 23:31.891
ranting about pumping
the brakes on the project,

23:31.925 --> 23:34.010
but here you are hitting
the gas. Why's that?

23:34.061 --> 23:36.512
Well, we're still at
war on three continents.

23:36.563 --> 23:39.432
- I heard that somewhere.
- No. The real reason you came back

23:39.483 --> 23:42.485
is you can't stand the idea that the
gadget could be built without you.

23:42.519 --> 23:45.188
You can't stand having
anyone else's name on it.

23:45.239 --> 23:47.774
You are so good at delivering
speeches, aren't you, Charlie?

23:47.825 --> 23:51.077
Heard you gave quite a eulogy
when I got my off-site promotion.

23:51.111 --> 23:54.914
And it only took you, what, two
weeks to become the Army's puppet.

23:56.818 --> 23:59.119
- Hey.
- (Grunts)

23:59.787 --> 24:02.455
(growling, grunting)

24:07.261 --> 24:10.430
Lazar: Come on. Enough fun, enough fun!

24:10.464 --> 24:12.548
I don't care what deal
you made with the colonel.

24:12.599 --> 24:16.127
You are never stepping
foot in the tech area again!

24:16.930 --> 24:19.272
What did Charlie mean when he
said a deal with the colonel?

24:19.306 --> 24:21.774
Does that have to do with
Frank's enlistment at all?

24:21.809 --> 24:23.192
I mean, sort of a quid pro quo?

24:23.227 --> 24:25.395
I mean, if you figure
that out, let us know.

24:25.446 --> 24:28.197
Frank's not exactly in the business
of explaining himself to us.

24:28.232 --> 24:30.733
Lorentzen: <i>Or to anyone, apparently.</i>

24:30.784 --> 24:33.653
<i>But Isaacs was wrong
about one thing.</i>

24:33.704 --> 24:37.707
<i>Frank got himself back into the
tech area after all, didn't he?</i>

24:41.011 --> 24:43.646
- <i> (music playing)</i>
- Can I have another?

24:44.408 --> 24:46.493
Understanding the
coordination of these assets

24:46.518 --> 24:50.471
is crucial to the fluid
progress of our mandate.

24:50.522 --> 24:51.805
Sincerely yours, Paul Crosley.

24:51.856 --> 24:53.774
You have it?

24:53.808 --> 24:55.643
Any mistakes, you're back on the jitney

24:55.694 --> 24:58.612
to whatever junior
college you crawled out of.

24:58.647 --> 25:00.030
All right.

25:00.065 --> 25:02.233
Hello. Oh.

25:02.284 --> 25:04.818
A mandatory sit-down with
our resident ink-slinger.

25:04.869 --> 25:06.954
Just before the clock strikes.

25:06.988 --> 25:08.572
You look like you need a drink.

25:08.623 --> 25:10.207
No, I'm back on land again.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.826
- What can I get you?
- Seltzer and lime, please.

25:12.877 --> 25:14.328
Really?

25:14.379 --> 25:16.997
- How long?
- Long enough to hurt.

25:17.048 --> 25:20.584
So, Mr. Lorentzen, you
have me for 15 minutes.

25:20.635 --> 25:22.753
- Let's make it good.
- All right.

25:22.804 --> 25:25.256
Well, the gun division's
humming along nicely.

25:25.307 --> 25:29.893
You're the backup plan the general
and Oppenheimer always dreamed of.

25:29.928 --> 25:33.097
- Yet until November...
- We were in the pig trough.

25:33.148 --> 25:34.332
Mm.

25:34.357 --> 25:37.225
The uranium enrichment problem
had us stalled in our tracks.

25:37.902 --> 25:41.238
That's quite a turnaround. What's
the opening sentence to that chapter?

25:42.357 --> 25:45.000
Well, we were at a low point.

25:45.527 --> 25:47.838
I was at a low point.

25:48.363 --> 25:49.877
Woman: <i>Paul.</i>

25:51.032 --> 25:53.450
<i>Paul!</i>

25:53.847 --> 25:55.314
_

26:03.461 --> 26:06.547
(sighs) I can't feel my arms.

26:19.060 --> 26:21.945
- <i> (Can thuds)</i>
- <i> (Retches)</i>

26:23.198 --> 26:25.332
(coughs)

26:26.451 --> 26:30.204
Let me guess, up all night
working on the enrichment problem?

26:34.242 --> 26:35.743
Inevitable.

26:35.794 --> 26:38.128
Do you know, maybe I'll
get a job after the war.

26:38.163 --> 26:41.915
<i>Or maybe I'll settle down,
have kids, regret my decisions.</i>

26:41.966 --> 26:44.668
<i>But there's one thing
I know for sure... </i>

26:44.719 --> 26:47.137
<i>you have no future.</i>

26:49.391 --> 26:51.642
You know, I understand.

26:53.345 --> 26:55.896
- <i> What?</i>
- The Site X liaison job.

26:55.930 --> 26:58.515
Getting passed over. I understand.

26:58.566 --> 27:01.268
I sympathize.

27:01.319 --> 27:03.821
Hallelujah.

27:04.989 --> 27:07.107
It's a beautiful day out.

27:07.158 --> 27:09.410
I'm gonna go find a tree.

27:09.444 --> 27:11.161
Maybe I'll solve the uranium problem

27:11.196 --> 27:13.447
and you'll find a way to
take that from me, too.

27:35.637 --> 27:37.020
Hello, Crosley.

27:41.232 --> 27:43.703
We brought detonators.

27:44.896 --> 27:48.414
Try not to blow yourself
up until we're gone.

27:48.999 --> 27:53.203
- Okay?
- Well, Hogarth's in his office. He has the paperwork.

27:53.238 --> 27:54.705
Yeah.

28:06.217 --> 28:08.085
Crosley: <i>There it is.</i>

28:08.136 --> 28:11.221
- Go ahead.
- Excuse me?

28:11.256 --> 28:13.557
Go on, Frank. Give a boy an education.

28:14.642 --> 28:16.760
Go on.

28:16.811 --> 28:19.012
Yeah.

28:19.063 --> 28:21.348
Gaseous diffusion, thermal diffusion,

28:21.399 --> 28:23.567
electromagnetic separation.

28:23.601 --> 28:25.269
Three methods for enriching uranium,

28:25.320 --> 28:27.771
only nobody knows which one is best

28:27.822 --> 28:30.691
or if any of them even works.

28:30.742 --> 28:33.827
And if we can't speed up
enrichment at an exponential pace?

28:33.862 --> 28:35.612
<i>Gun model dies on the vine.</i>

28:35.663 --> 28:37.614
Or, who knows, upside could be

28:37.665 --> 28:40.200
Hogarth shoots himself in the head.

28:40.251 --> 28:41.418
<i>So go on, Frank.</i>

28:44.289 --> 28:45.589
Dazzle us

28:45.623 --> 28:48.125
with that patented smugness

28:48.176 --> 28:51.845
that says you're the only one who
understands the gravity of our great war.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.931
The kingdom, the power,

28:53.965 --> 28:57.551
the glory right here for your taking.

28:58.853 --> 29:01.522
I'm just trying to do my job, Paul.

29:04.275 --> 29:06.109
Dr. Winter, sir?

29:06.144 --> 29:09.446
- I have to ask you to come with me.
- Why?

29:09.481 --> 29:11.532
No, he's fine. He's with me.

29:11.566 --> 29:13.329
He's been cleared at the gate.

29:13.354 --> 29:14.902
Man: <i>Supposed to call
the MPs if you're not</i>

29:14.953 --> 29:16.954
<i>out of the tech area
in five minutes,</i>

29:16.988 --> 29:18.872
<i>per Dr. Isaacs.</i>

29:18.907 --> 29:20.457
(laughs) Who?

29:20.492 --> 29:22.376
Dr. Isaacs?

29:22.410 --> 29:25.078
- Never heard of him.
- It's okay.

29:25.129 --> 29:27.798
It's okay. We were just leaving.

29:31.669 --> 29:33.554
Good luck, Paul.

29:33.588 --> 29:35.722
Crosley: <i>So even the
great Frank Winter</i>

29:35.757 --> 29:37.558
<i>couldn't solve the uranium problem.</i>

29:37.592 --> 29:41.011
And was that your first interaction
with Frank since he got back?

29:41.062 --> 29:43.230
I had seen him around digging latrines,

29:43.264 --> 29:45.349
other vital work.

29:45.400 --> 29:46.934
Surprised to see him back on the Hill?

29:46.985 --> 29:48.685
In a private's uniform? Yeah.

29:48.736 --> 29:50.885
And I think it's safe to
say most of us had questions.

29:50.910 --> 29:52.739
Get any answers?

29:52.774 --> 29:55.275
The colonel needed another
soldier for his holy crusade.

29:56.195 --> 29:58.612
Why all the curiosity about Frank?

29:58.663 --> 30:00.497
Just filling in the blanks.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.950
You devil. (laughs)

30:03.001 --> 30:05.919
First, you try to reignite your
old flame with the man's wife.

30:05.954 --> 30:08.205
Then you tar and feather
Frank in the official history.

30:08.256 --> 30:11.458
- Bravo.
- I'm sorry, gentlemen.

30:11.509 --> 30:14.018
We need to clear the tables
for tonight's festivities.

30:14.073 --> 30:17.464
Well, enough already. I have a year's
work to do before the clock strikes.

30:17.515 --> 30:19.633
Uh, how'd you fix it?

30:19.684 --> 30:24.021
The problem with the uranium that
was slowing down the gun model.

30:24.055 --> 30:25.722
Oppenheimer had a eureka.

30:25.773 --> 30:28.475
- On November 29th.
- Yeah, round about.

30:28.526 --> 30:31.194
One day, Oppenheimer marches
into the office unannounced

30:31.229 --> 30:34.197
and out of nowhere just
delivers a solution.

30:34.232 --> 30:36.817
Turns out the man's a genius after all.

30:36.868 --> 30:39.371
And what was the solution?

30:39.954 --> 30:42.623
Well, we had been thinking of
the processes as competitors

30:42.657 --> 30:45.826
and Oppie realized they were more
efficient when linked in tandem.

30:45.877 --> 30:47.995
Collaborators.

30:49.163 --> 30:51.048
Yeah, I suppose you could say that.

30:51.082 --> 30:53.396
Well, time and tide.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.919
Oh, this reborn gun division,

30:55.970 --> 30:58.522
is the nickname still Thin Man?

30:58.937 --> 31:00.424
We're calling it Little Boy.

31:00.475 --> 31:03.260
- Bet there's a story there.
- (Chuckles)

31:03.311 --> 31:06.480
I'm afraid it will probably
put your readers to sleep.

31:08.650 --> 31:10.100
(Sighs)

31:12.103 --> 31:15.822
<i>(chatter over P.A.)</i>

31:24.499 --> 31:26.833
<i>(engine starts)</i>

31:33.257 --> 31:34.708
Hair of the bloodhound?

31:37.795 --> 31:39.262
You should give my job to Helen.

31:39.777 --> 31:41.598
She's more experienced than I am,

31:41.633 --> 31:43.733
she's been to Site X,

31:43.968 --> 31:45.740
and she cares.

31:45.970 --> 31:47.354
She won't shag you

31:47.388 --> 31:49.124
if that's what you're thinking.

31:49.857 --> 31:52.225
Enjoy watching Frank Winter

31:52.276 --> 31:54.194
get escorted from the building?

31:54.228 --> 31:57.872
(Chuckles) Americans are a funny lot.

31:58.783 --> 32:00.400
They poke fun at cricket,

32:00.451 --> 32:03.654
you let them play, they
have a few lucky bowls

32:03.705 --> 32:07.040
and they act as if they
invented the damn sport.

32:07.075 --> 32:08.801
Yeah, they are unique.

32:09.377 --> 32:12.829
They'd be nowhere without us.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.665
I have a healthy self-regard,

32:14.716 --> 32:16.633
but neither one of us is getting
written into the history books.

32:16.668 --> 32:17.884
Don't be daft.

32:17.919 --> 32:19.503
Us.

32:19.554 --> 32:21.638
The home team.

32:21.673 --> 32:24.224
War is no longer a question

32:24.258 --> 32:26.176
of artillery or trenches

32:26.227 --> 32:29.229
or how many tank divisions you can marshal

32:29.263 --> 32:31.658
to outflank your rival.

32:31.766 --> 32:34.601
Information is the new gunpowder.

32:34.652 --> 32:36.770
Information is the future.

32:36.821 --> 32:39.775
And Britain needs a future.

32:43.778 --> 32:46.496
You need a future.

32:51.703 --> 32:54.287
So is this why you gave me the promotion?

32:57.258 --> 33:00.794
The Yankees are niggardly allies.

33:02.346 --> 33:05.015
They dine out on our science

33:05.049 --> 33:06.967
and what do they give us in return?

33:07.018 --> 33:08.552
<i>Table crumbs.</i>

33:08.603 --> 33:10.771
So when the war's over

33:10.805 --> 33:12.806
and the nuclear power boom begins,

33:12.857 --> 33:14.858
they'll own the future.

33:14.892 --> 33:18.278
We must take what we can as fast as we can.

33:18.312 --> 33:20.697
- You want me to steal for you?
-<i> No.</i>

33:20.732 --> 33:22.983
For king and country.

33:23.034 --> 33:25.619
You know, I knew a man
who was shot for less.

33:25.653 --> 33:28.159
<i>Think about your country, Paul.</i>

33:28.740 --> 33:31.800
Everything will be different after the war.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.044
We'll go home.

33:35.713 --> 33:37.464
Together.

33:41.219 --> 33:43.637
You have regrets about Lucy.

33:45.423 --> 33:48.058
I know there are things that
you wish you could take back

33:48.092 --> 33:50.177
that you said and did.

33:50.228 --> 33:52.095
And so what if I do?

33:53.514 --> 33:56.266
My daughter's a forgiving soul.

33:56.317 --> 33:59.069
Too forgiving.

33:59.103 --> 34:01.905
But she knows that we're here together

34:01.939 --> 34:04.858
and she wants to mend fences.

34:09.530 --> 34:11.782
She wants a life with you.

34:17.839 --> 34:19.937
I never had a son, Paul.

34:21.208 --> 34:23.603
But you do.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.098
And he's a gem.

34:29.100 --> 34:31.351
Lucy got him back.

34:31.385 --> 34:33.414
My grandson.

34:33.554 --> 34:36.723
You can leave something
behind in this world.

34:36.774 --> 34:40.034
A legacy for Henry.

34:40.821 --> 34:43.083
<i>So help me, Paul.</i>

34:43.447 --> 34:45.623
<i>You won't just go home a man.</i>

34:46.367 --> 34:48.672
<i>You'll go home a father.</i>

34:49.070 --> 34:51.905
<i>You'll go home to your little boy.</i>

34:58.061 --> 34:59.778
Darrow: <i>This is what
we're paying you for,</i>

34:59.812 --> 35:02.030
<i>rumors about Frank Winter?</i>

35:02.065 --> 35:03.865
I haven't seen a check in six months.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.233
My own paper cut me off.

35:05.284 --> 35:06.868
It's your privilege

35:06.903 --> 35:10.122
to document the scientific
history of this project,

35:10.156 --> 35:12.564
not editorialize about my soldiers.

35:13.076 --> 35:14.876
It's the holiday.

35:14.911 --> 35:18.997
This was a side project
to keep my pencil sharp.

35:20.883 --> 35:22.968
You know, I could never get a bead

35:23.002 --> 35:25.554
<i>on why you let Frank
back onto the Hill.</i>

35:25.588 --> 35:27.839
<i>I thought it was to shut him up</i>

35:27.890 --> 35:29.174
<i>or torture him.</i>

35:29.225 --> 35:32.811
Then suddenly, it hit me.

35:34.623 --> 35:37.992
Oppenheimer, he's got
his head in the clouds

35:38.017 --> 35:41.637
and his sidekick is this
28-year-old hotshot

35:41.662 --> 35:44.363
who you don't fully believe in.

35:44.740 --> 35:47.359
Isaacs couldn't handle the ranchers alone.

35:47.410 --> 35:49.470
He couldn't solve the uranium problem.

35:50.363 --> 35:51.863
And you knew that sooner or later,

35:51.914 --> 35:53.415
this kid's gonna roll another seven.

35:53.449 --> 35:55.667
What's your point?

35:55.701 --> 35:58.837
You don't just keep your enemies closer.

35:58.871 --> 36:01.923
Frank Winter invented the gadget.

36:01.958 --> 36:03.792
You let him back on the Hill

36:03.843 --> 36:08.130
because whatever he did
or whoever he pissed off,

36:08.181 --> 36:10.046
you need an insurance policy.

36:10.581 --> 36:13.617
And the way I see it,
you're not the only one.

36:15.350 --> 36:17.384
<i>The uranium problem... </i>

36:17.723 --> 36:19.357
<i>that was Frank, wasn't it?</i>

36:22.395 --> 36:25.986
<i>Oppenheimer couldn't have everyone
thinking an Army private he exiled</i>

36:26.011 --> 36:29.680
<i>solved the problem that was keeping
Little Boy on the sidelines.</i>

36:29.705 --> 36:31.873
<i>Now, when he saw what Frank did... </i>

36:32.155 --> 36:34.539
<i>what nobody else could do... </i>

36:34.574 --> 36:37.826
<i>Oppie realized the same
thing you did six months ago.</i>

36:39.996 --> 36:43.215
<i>The day will come when he's
gonna need Frank again.</i>

36:46.419 --> 36:47.969

Is there anything about

37:03.986 --> 37:05.070
Of course not.
