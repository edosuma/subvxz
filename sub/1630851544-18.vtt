00:01.653 --> 00:04.091
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...This is my brother Terry.

00:04.134 --> 00:05.831
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.485
<i>Well, he said that he quit</i>

00:07.529 --> 00:09.009
'cause he couldn't keep up
anymore. You don't believe him?

00:09.052 --> 00:11.141
<i>Terry's never stuck</i> <i>
with a job in his life.</i>

00:11.185 --> 00:12.621
He does what he loves
till he doesn't anymore.

00:12.664 --> 00:15.058
<i>Then it's on to the next thing,</i> <i>
like a new toy.</i>

00:15.102 --> 00:17.060
I told you,
I'll find a new thing.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.323
<i>You just got to let me be, bro.</i><i>Just looking out for you.</i>

00:19.367 --> 00:21.064
It's what a big brother's
supposed to do.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.500
- Morning, baby.
- Sergeant Harrelson.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.502
This'll be six nights in a row
I've slept over.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.809
We're trying to make a baby,
remember?

00:28.724 --> 00:29.725
I love you.

00:33.729 --> 00:36.036
Spring cleaning, huh?

00:36.079 --> 00:38.864
Hey, Pop, just, uh,
sorting your stuff from mine.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.997
There's a hell of a lot of
history here to go through

00:41.041 --> 00:42.694
- if you're gonna be moving out.
- Mm.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.480
Oh, wow.

00:45.523 --> 00:49.136
I remember you made me
read this back in the day.

00:51.138 --> 00:53.879
Oh, yeah, Baldwin.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.968
He knew how to tell it
like it is.

00:56.012 --> 00:57.840
Living in this country
as a Black man.

00:57.883 --> 01:00.408
I must've been about 14 or 15.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.888
That book had an impact on me.

01:02.932 --> 01:05.108
I was probably too pissed at you
to tell you back then,

01:05.152 --> 01:08.851
- but it really did.
- Hmm.

01:08.894 --> 01:12.202
So, talk to me. What'd you think
about the spot on Sycamore?

01:12.246 --> 01:13.986
- Sycamore?
- Yeah, the apartment

01:14.030 --> 01:15.901
with the pool and the hot tub.

01:15.945 --> 01:18.165
Oh, yeah, I don't know.
I'm not much of a swimmer.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.470
What about the place
on 53rd?

01:19.514 --> 01:21.298
That's an easy walk
from there to here.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.648
Neighborhood would
- still feel familiar.
- Listen,

01:23.692 --> 01:26.173
I meant what I said about
getting out of your hair.

01:26.216 --> 01:28.131
But don't rush
the old man, okay?

01:28.175 --> 01:30.438
Okay, Pop, my bad.

01:30.481 --> 01:31.743
I'll put the Baldwin
in your box.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.093
You keep it.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.452
Yo.
Hey.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.410
- What's up, bro?
- What's up?

01:46.454 --> 01:47.890
How were the waves
this morning?

01:47.933 --> 01:49.500
Oh, gnarly, dude.

01:49.544 --> 01:50.762
Yeah, best they've been
all month.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.634
- Storm must be coming.
- Oh, yeah?

01:52.677 --> 01:54.114
So when are we getting you
out there, man?

01:54.157 --> 01:56.028
I got a board with your name
written all over it.

01:56.072 --> 01:57.943
Soon as the sharks
migrate south.

01:57.987 --> 01:59.684
Man, you've been watching
too much Shark Week.

01:59.728 --> 02:01.164
Or you've been
watching too little.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.687
The stuff we face
on a daily basis,

02:02.731 --> 02:04.211
the thing you're
worried about is the water

02:04.254 --> 02:05.342
and a little sharky?

02:05.386 --> 02:07.214
I'm good with risks
I can control.

02:07.257 --> 02:09.738
Creatures with sharp teeth
that swim faster than you

02:09.781 --> 02:11.392
and consider you
a nice snack... Hello?

02:11.435 --> 02:13.307
No, thank you.

02:14.308 --> 02:16.919
O-Okay, well,
what happened?

02:16.962 --> 02:18.399
W-What did he do?

02:18.442 --> 02:21.445
Oh, no, okay, I'll come down
right now. Thanks, man.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.186
- Yo, what's up?
- A buddy of mine

02:23.230 --> 02:24.535
down at Central.
Terry, my brother,

02:24.579 --> 02:25.623
he's been arrested.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.147
- What for?
- I don't know,

02:27.190 --> 02:28.887
but I got to head down, figure
out what he did this time.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.062
All right.
We'll tell Hondo.

02:30.106 --> 02:31.281
Thanks!

02:32.326 --> 02:34.458
Ah, man.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.858
Commander Hicks.
Been a minute.

02:42.901 --> 02:44.816
What brings you
- to my side of town?
- What do you think?

02:44.860 --> 02:46.122
Your coffee.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.602
And a couple of meetings.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.081
- Americano?
- You got it.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.213
- Got you.
- Thanks, buddy.

02:50.257 --> 02:53.173
- Robert!
- Look at this.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.000
The Honorable
Martin Walker.

02:55.044 --> 02:57.220
- How you doing?
- Good. You've gained weight.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.831
You lost hair.

02:59.875 --> 03:02.312
Hey, Anthony, let me guess.
Triple Americano?

03:02.356 --> 03:03.879
Nah, Judge. Single.

03:03.922 --> 03:04.923
What?

03:04.967 --> 03:06.055
Cutting back these days.

03:06.098 --> 03:07.883
Oh, good for you.

03:07.926 --> 03:10.625
I quit smoking.
- Almost a year now.
Get out of here.

03:10.668 --> 03:12.888
Maggie's influence, I'm betting.
Yeah. Gave me an ultimatum.

03:12.931 --> 03:14.498
Her or the cigarettes.
And, you know,

03:14.542 --> 03:16.021
cigarettes can't cook lasagna.

03:16.065 --> 03:17.240
That's for sure.

03:17.284 --> 03:19.721
Wow. It's been a long time.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.636
- Yeah, it has.
- Yeah.

03:21.679 --> 03:24.378
- Hey, you still got your clubs?
- Yeah. They're just

03:24.421 --> 03:26.597
- collecting dust in my office.
- Bust them out.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.860
We can hit the links
this weekend, catch up.

03:28.904 --> 03:31.298
- Sunday works for me.
- Perfect. Hey, look,

03:31.341 --> 03:33.256
I-I got to run. I'm meeting
Maggie for an early lunch.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.171
Oh, good.
- Well, give her my best.
- Will do.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.694
- All right, man.
- Yeah.

03:36.738 --> 03:38.479
- It's great seeing you, buddy.
- Good to see you, too, man.

03:38.522 --> 03:39.915
- Yeah.
- Anthony, you take care.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.221
- You, too, Judge.
- We'll see you Sunday, buddy.

03:41.264 --> 03:42.831
Yeah,
I'm looking forward to it.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.269
That'll be $3.50.

03:47.314 --> 03:48.880
Keep it.

03:48.924 --> 03:51.100
How's your daughter doing,
- by the way?
- She's great.

03:51.143 --> 03:52.493
Singing all the time.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.843
Yeah. My daughter, Molly,
was the same way.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.454
We got her into musical theater
to give her an outlet

03:57.498 --> 03:59.151
- and us a break.
- Did it work?

03:59.195 --> 04:00.892
No.

04:00.936 --> 04:03.373
And I'd be okay if I never heard
anything from <i>Cats</i> again.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.855
Yo, was that...?Stay here.

04:07.899 --> 04:09.423
LAPD! Commander Hicks.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.033
I counted three gunshots

04:11.076 --> 04:12.339
from the parking garage.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.738
Martin!

04:22.914 --> 04:24.307
Martin.

04:26.178 --> 04:28.746
You stay... you stay
with me, Marty.

04:28.790 --> 04:31.183
We're gonna get you help.
Deputy! I need an R/A

04:31.227 --> 04:33.403
here now.

04:35.927 --> 04:37.755
- Stay with him!
- Yes, sir!

04:49.376 --> 04:50.942
Aah.

04:53.989 --> 04:56.861
Yeah, this is Commander Hicks.
I got a shooting

04:56.905 --> 04:58.254
at the county courthouse.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.736
Possible suspect vehicle
is a rust-colored Mustang

05:01.779 --> 05:03.781
heading north on Sepulveda.

05:43.081 --> 05:44.387
RHD's taking over

05:44.431 --> 05:45.432
- the scene?
- Afraid so.

05:45.475 --> 05:46.781
Judge Walker didn't make it.

05:46.824 --> 05:48.826
It's officially a
homicide. The mayor

05:48.870 --> 05:51.394
and the chief
want answers yesterday.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.179
Martin was a big deal.
Almost 30 years on the bench.

05:54.223 --> 05:57.182
Word is that you talked to him
shortly before the shooting.

05:57.226 --> 05:59.533
Did he say anything to indicate
he might be, uh, targeted?

05:59.576 --> 06:00.795
Mention any threats?

06:00.838 --> 06:02.536
No, nothing. We were just,

06:02.579 --> 06:04.494
you know, shooting the breeze,
catching up.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.235
We made plans
to golf this weekend.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.019
You radioed
a vehicle description.

06:08.063 --> 06:10.761
- Rust-colored Mustang. What year?
- I don't know.

06:10.805 --> 06:12.763
It was older. Early '90s, maybe.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.765
- Plates?
- Partial.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.680
Three, Peter, Charlie.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.552
What about the shooter?
- You see him?
- Yeah.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.945
He was wearing a hoodie
and a baseball cap.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.425
Black, white, brown?

06:22.469 --> 06:23.774
I'm sorry, Detective.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.733
I couldn't see him.
I couldn't stop him.

06:25.776 --> 06:28.475
I was a second late
- every step of the way.
Came as soon as we heard.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.868
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

06:31.913 --> 06:33.088
Just, um...

06:33.131 --> 06:34.437
Judge was a friend.

06:34.481 --> 06:36.918
Barb and his wife, Maggie,
were always tight.

06:36.961 --> 06:39.616
Four of us used to spend a lot
of time together back then.

06:39.660 --> 06:42.750
- I'm very sorry.
- Thanks. Thing is is after Barb died,

06:42.793 --> 06:45.143
Martin and I just somehow let
our friendship slip away.

06:45.187 --> 06:46.536
It's a shame.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.364
- He was a good guy.
- Is there anything we can do?

06:48.408 --> 06:49.452
No.

06:49.496 --> 06:50.845
I got to talk to his wife.

06:50.888 --> 06:52.020
She's gonna be devastated.

06:52.063 --> 06:53.369
I'm afraid you can't do that, Commander.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.718
Not until she talks to RHD.

06:54.762 --> 06:56.154
Oh, right.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.460
I'm a witness.

06:57.504 --> 06:58.853
- For whatever that's worth.
- BURROWS:Listen,

06:58.896 --> 07:00.289
I'm gonna head back
to the station,

07:00.332 --> 07:01.551
get started on this.
If you think of anything else...

07:01.595 --> 07:03.423
Yeah, I know. I know the drill.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.641
Yeah.

07:04.685 --> 07:06.121
Hey, Burrows.

07:08.123 --> 07:11.126
Listen, if it's okay with you,
let SWAT lend a hand on this.

07:12.693 --> 07:15.304
Sure. More eyes
couldn't hurt.

07:15.347 --> 07:17.132
- Just run things past me?
- Of course.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.742
Appreciate it.

07:24.182 --> 07:26.228
Thanks for bailing me out.

07:26.271 --> 07:29.187
I'm good for it. I just got
to liquidate a few things.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.493
Breaking and entering?

07:30.537 --> 07:31.538
It's a misunderstanding.

07:31.581 --> 07:32.713
- I got it handled.
- You're looking

07:32.756 --> 07:34.366
at three to five
years, Terry.

07:34.410 --> 07:36.281
I was helping somebody out.

07:36.325 --> 07:38.501
- Who?
- This girl that I'm seeing.

07:38.545 --> 07:41.809
April. Her ex
is a piece of work.

07:41.852 --> 07:43.027
He was, like, abusive.

07:43.071 --> 07:44.376
She's scared to see him
since they broke up,

07:44.420 --> 07:45.726
and... And?

07:45.769 --> 07:48.685
And she asked me
to go by his place

07:48.729 --> 07:50.382
and pick up
some of her stuff.

07:50.426 --> 07:52.689
Okay, so you did
- break and enter.
- No, dude.

07:52.733 --> 07:55.562
It was her stuff.

07:55.605 --> 07:58.521
She gave me a list.
She was living there.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.915
It was just some clothes
and some little figurine

08:00.958 --> 08:02.525
that her grandma gave her
before she died.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.396
Geez, you really know
how to pick them, man.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.660
- Here we go.
- What?

08:06.703 --> 08:08.226
You. You!

08:08.270 --> 08:10.751
And all the judgment.
You know, everybody thinks

08:10.794 --> 08:13.710
you're this, like, chill,
laid-back kind of guy.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.407
They don't see how you treat me.

08:15.451 --> 08:18.149
- It's a double standard, bro.
- Okay, then where's April right now?

08:18.193 --> 08:20.108
What, she too busy
to pick you up?

08:20.151 --> 08:21.501
- That's not the point!
- Bail you out?

08:21.544 --> 08:22.632
What is, then, Terry?

08:22.676 --> 08:25.156
You owe me
the benefit of the doubt.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.593
That you think,
oh, I don't know,

08:26.636 --> 08:29.117
"Maybe he's doing
the right thing for once."

08:29.160 --> 08:33.687
Even if it is, whatever,
a little legally fuzzy.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.297
"Legally fuzzy"?
That's not even a thing

08:35.340 --> 08:36.907
at my job.'Cause this is about you?

08:36.951 --> 08:38.822
- Oh, right. Okay. Right.
- It's always about you.

08:38.866 --> 08:41.869
Okay, you know what? Next time,
you can sit in that cell,

08:41.912 --> 08:43.218
make some new friends.
How's that?

08:43.261 --> 08:46.090
This is exactly
why I didn't call you.

08:52.401 --> 08:54.098
What do we got?

08:54.142 --> 08:56.144
Got the parking garage
surveillance footage

08:56.187 --> 08:57.580
from Burrows.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.800
You can see, uh,
Walker heading to his car.

08:59.843 --> 09:01.584
Then he spins around,

09:01.628 --> 09:03.325
like someone
calls his name.

09:03.368 --> 09:05.109
But check this out.
He says something to Walker,

09:05.153 --> 09:06.633
and Walker responds.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.460
They have a short
back-and-forth.

09:08.504 --> 09:10.550
- Not your average hit.
- Yeah.

09:13.248 --> 09:15.467
Lot of people
unhappy with Walker

09:15.511 --> 09:17.165
over a recent ruling.
He declared

09:17.208 --> 09:18.775
a mistrial
in a big class action suit

09:18.819 --> 09:20.255
over a town's water supply.

09:20.298 --> 09:22.474
Bennington?
The town whose groundwater

09:22.518 --> 09:24.215
is loaded with pesticides?
He oversaw that?

09:24.259 --> 09:25.565
Yeah. The whole town was rocked.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.088
Cancer clusters, birth defects.

09:27.131 --> 09:28.785
Oh, great.

09:28.829 --> 09:31.135
So, basically, anyone from
that community has a motive.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.094
There's been a second shooting
tied to a rust-colored Mustang.

09:33.137 --> 09:34.748
- Where?
- Culver City.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.837
But the victim, man named
Brian Young, he survived.

09:36.880 --> 09:39.535
Been taken to Newburn Memorial.
Well, it could be connected

09:39.579 --> 09:41.189
to the Bennington case.
Just might be the beginning.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.669
Deac, head over.
I'll call Burrows

09:42.712 --> 09:44.627
- and tell him you're coming.
- Roger that.

09:48.196 --> 09:49.545
Burrows.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.938
Hey. Is the victim
stabile yet?

09:50.981 --> 09:52.940
Yeah.
Took some arm-twisting,

09:52.983 --> 09:55.986
but we're cleared
to talk to him. 519.

09:59.294 --> 10:01.252
Brian Young?
I'm Detective Burrows.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.777
This is Sergeant Kay. We'd like
to ask you some questions.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.822
Mm.
The man who shot you...

10:05.866 --> 10:07.041
It wasn't a man.

10:07.084 --> 10:09.130
- It was a woman.
- A woman.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.611
Did you recognize her?
No.

10:11.654 --> 10:15.092
She had on a hooded sweatshirt
and a baseball hat.

10:15.136 --> 10:17.051
I didn't get a great look.

10:17.094 --> 10:18.748
Any idea why she came after you?

10:18.792 --> 10:20.924
- She say anything?
- YOUNG:Yeah.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.492
She said,
"You ruined our lives."

10:23.535 --> 10:26.669
- "Our lives"?
- That's what she said.

10:26.713 --> 10:28.671
I don't know what it means.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.107
And she didn't say
anything else?

10:30.151 --> 10:32.109
She might have, but then the gun

10:32.153 --> 10:34.155
came out. I took off running.

10:35.591 --> 10:37.724
And she shot me in the back.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.073
Mr. Young, do you
have anything to do

10:39.116 --> 10:40.857
with the situation
going on in Bennington?

10:40.901 --> 10:42.511
With what?
It's the town

10:42.554 --> 10:43.773
that's been affected
by fertilizer

10:43.817 --> 10:45.688
leaking into their water supply. No.

10:45.732 --> 10:47.559
What the hell
does that have to do with this?

10:47.603 --> 10:49.736
Well, nothing, maybe.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.912
You're a social
worker, is that right?

10:51.955 --> 10:53.653
Yeah. 20 years.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.916
Trying to help people.

10:55.959 --> 10:58.962
I guess karma doesn't exist.
We're gonna

10:59.006 --> 11:01.356
need access to your case files.
But I've worked

11:01.399 --> 11:03.488
with hundreds of kids
over the years.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.708
Eh, it's a place to start.

11:05.752 --> 11:07.710
Unless you can think
of anything else.

11:08.755 --> 11:09.886
No.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.540
Actually,

11:11.583 --> 11:12.889
wait. There is something.

11:12.933 --> 11:15.500
Uh, the woman,

11:15.544 --> 11:18.503
she had on a necklace
with a pendant.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.375
The letter "V."

11:21.419 --> 11:22.638
<i>Okay.</i>

11:22.682 --> 11:25.685
- Will do. Bye.
- Hey.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.426
Hey. How'd things go at
the hospital with Young?

11:28.470 --> 11:30.341
He have anything
- to help us out?
- Well, maybe.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.039
He's not connected
to the Bennington case,

11:32.082 --> 11:34.911
but get this.
He said the shooter's a woman.

11:34.955 --> 11:37.044
Feel for the guy.
A public servant

11:37.087 --> 11:40.525
for 20 years. Gets two bullets
in the back as a thank-you.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.311
Everything good?

11:43.354 --> 11:46.401
Yeah. Yeah, I... I got a call
from my father's realtor.

11:46.444 --> 11:48.359
It turns out he flaked on
all his apartment showings

11:48.403 --> 11:50.100
that I set for him.
Total no-show.

11:50.144 --> 11:52.494
Why do you think
he's dragging his feet?

11:52.537 --> 11:54.322
I don't know.

11:54.365 --> 11:55.715
Seemed like he was cool
with moving out.

11:55.758 --> 11:56.977
Least, he said he was.

11:57.020 --> 11:59.588
I'm only asking
because when Annie's dad died,

11:59.631 --> 12:01.590
her mom didn't know what to do.

12:01.633 --> 12:04.158
She ended up moving in with
Annie's brother for a while.

12:04.201 --> 12:07.291
Maybe he's, uh,
just afraid of being alone.

12:08.815 --> 12:11.731
I guess I got to have
another conversation with him.

12:15.386 --> 12:17.998
Thank you for your
time, Mrs. Walker.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.826
I know it's a lot
to ask right now,

12:19.869 --> 12:21.523
but it's always important

12:21.566 --> 12:24.047
to get a statement
while things are fresh.

12:24.091 --> 12:25.919
Thank you.

12:28.399 --> 12:30.140
HICKS:Maggie.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.359
Oh, Bob.

12:31.402 --> 12:33.796
Oh, man.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.365
I'm so sorry.

12:37.408 --> 12:40.542
I told him
not to go in to work today.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.239
He had a cold.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.154
He was up all night with it.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.330
But he just...
He wouldn't listen to me.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.898
- And now I'm so angry.
- It's okay.

12:48.942 --> 12:51.814
- It's okay to be angry.
- They said

12:51.858 --> 12:53.555
that you were there with him.

12:53.598 --> 12:55.165
Yeah.

12:56.601 --> 12:59.343
At least there was
a friendly face.

12:59.387 --> 13:00.823
I wish I could've
done more.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.825
I wish maybe I could
have stopped it somehow,

13:02.869 --> 13:04.827
but I was too late.

13:04.871 --> 13:06.611
But if you need
help with anything

13:06.655 --> 13:08.744
or the girls need something,
you let me know.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.006
All right?

13:13.880 --> 13:15.403
I don't...

13:15.446 --> 13:17.144
I don't know how to do this.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.802
How did you get through it
with Barb?

13:22.845 --> 13:24.804
I wish I could say
there's an easy way,

13:24.847 --> 13:26.196
but there just isn't.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.851
But what helped me the most

13:28.895 --> 13:32.463
was support from good
friends like you and Martin.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.639
And I'm here now
for you, Maggie.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.424
I'm here for anything
that you need.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.905
I just want you
to find who did this.

13:38.948 --> 13:40.384
Okay?

13:41.821 --> 13:43.779
Okay.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.216
STREET:Man, I'm trying to connect
the dots between Judge Walker

13:46.260 --> 13:48.566
and the second
victim, Brian Young.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.786
Walker used to work
- family court back in the day.
And Young

13:50.830 --> 13:51.918
is a social worker,
so their paths

13:51.961 --> 13:53.093
must've crossed
a bunch of times.

13:53.136 --> 13:55.182
- You look for common cases?
- Yeah,

13:55.225 --> 13:56.748
but most of them
involve placing foster kids.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.576
They're juvie records,
so they're sealed.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.187
Till Burrows
comes up with a warrant,

14:00.230 --> 14:01.710
I'm just spinning my wheels.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.451
Hey. You still running that
partial plate on the Mustang?

14:03.494 --> 14:04.844
Yeah, but with only
three out of

14:04.887 --> 14:06.976
seven digits, it's casting
a wide net. Takes time.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.717
How'd it go with Terry?

14:08.760 --> 14:10.110
Not great. Had to post his bail.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.025
He's been charged with B and E.

14:12.068 --> 14:13.461
A guy that big, you sure
he didn't break something

14:13.504 --> 14:15.071
by accident?
Yeah, might explain

14:15.115 --> 14:16.856
the breaking,
doesn't explain the entering.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.858
Says he was helping
his girlfriend

14:18.901 --> 14:21.904
get her belongings from her ex.
Went into the guy's house.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.514
Man, I don't know
what he was thinking.

14:23.558 --> 14:24.951
What're you gonna do?
I don't know.

14:24.994 --> 14:27.910
After talking with him,
I feel like just letting him

14:27.954 --> 14:30.173
take the fall for once.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.001
Yeah, but you're his brother,
so you won't.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.916
Hey.

14:33.960 --> 14:35.309
You know my mom
put me through hell.

14:35.352 --> 14:38.442
Made me regret every time
I stepped in to help her.

14:38.486 --> 14:39.704
But now that she's gone,

14:39.748 --> 14:41.402
I'm glad I tried
all those times.

14:41.445 --> 14:42.969
Family's complicated.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.058
STREET:Maybe lower your
expectations a little.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.495
Otherwise, you're gonna end up
disappointed every time.

14:47.538 --> 14:49.279
Yeah, I hear
you. I hear you.

14:49.323 --> 14:51.368
Think I just hit pay dirt.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.717
I've been narrowing
down Mustangs

14:52.761 --> 14:55.068
based on the partial plate.
Might have a winner.

14:55.111 --> 14:57.461
All right, registered owner
is Mac Griffith.

14:57.505 --> 15:00.595
Couple misdemeanor batteries,
resisting arrest.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.858
I'm not seeing it.
- What stands out about this guy?
Mac's divorced,

15:02.902 --> 15:04.338
but up until a year
ago, he was married

15:04.381 --> 15:07.210
to a woman named
- Virginia Ashfield.
- Wait a second.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.256
Brian Young said the woman who
shot him was wearing a pendant

15:09.299 --> 15:11.911
with the letter "V."Exactly. Could
stand for Virginia.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.174
All right. Nice work.

15:14.217 --> 15:15.610
Deac, grab Hondo

15:15.653 --> 15:17.307
and head over to Griffith's
house. See what he knows.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.787
DEACON:Got it.

15:29.841 --> 15:31.234
Sounds like he's home.

15:31.278 --> 15:33.106
Sounds like the
whole band is home.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.426
Mac Griffith, LAPD!

15:49.470 --> 15:51.428
We'd like to talk to you!

15:51.472 --> 15:54.910
♪ Flyer than a plane,
faster than a train ♪

15:54.954 --> 15:55.998
♪ You try to compare...

15:57.130 --> 15:59.480
Mr. Griffith,
are you in there?

16:00.524 --> 16:02.918
It's the LAPD!
Open the door!

16:02.962 --> 16:04.833
Hondo, he's heading out
the three side.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.269
Copy.

16:28.944 --> 16:31.033
Why are you
- in such a hurry, Mac?
- I didn't do anything.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.035
Maybe you didn't, but what about
your ex, Virginia?

16:33.079 --> 16:34.471
Virginia?
Yeah.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.038
Where is she?
We need to talk to her.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.345
Virginia's dead, man.

16:47.528 --> 16:49.051
Rest of the house is clear.

16:49.095 --> 16:50.966
Listen, I only ran

16:51.010 --> 16:52.141
'cause I thought
y'all were after me

16:52.185 --> 16:53.664
for the knockoff Cartiers.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.797
Well, that's not
why we're here.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.712
We came to talk
about Virginia.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.148
How'd she die?

17:00.758 --> 17:03.109
She, uh...

17:03.152 --> 17:05.241
took her own life.

17:05.285 --> 17:06.982
A month ago.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.940
Where were you at the time?

17:08.984 --> 17:11.204
Visiting my brother
in Salt Lake.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.554
Hadn't talked to her in a while.
Had she been

17:13.597 --> 17:16.513
- suicidal before?
- Virginia always dealt with depression.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.515
She had
a really rough childhood.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.604
Raised in foster care.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.911
She didn't talk about it
much, but, uh, I could tell

17:22.954 --> 17:24.913
that it haunted her.
And you got divorced

17:24.956 --> 17:27.437
- about, what, a year ago?
- They tell you

17:27.481 --> 17:31.050
not to get involved with someone
while you're in the program.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.313
Especially another addict.

17:33.356 --> 17:35.402
But, uh, we were in love

17:35.445 --> 17:37.186
and dumb.

17:37.230 --> 17:39.493
And I wanted to help her.

17:39.536 --> 17:42.061
Fix her. But, uh,

17:42.104 --> 17:44.106
I guess Virginia

17:44.150 --> 17:46.587
was the type of broke
that you can't fix.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.110
HONDO:You own

17:48.154 --> 17:50.982
a rust-colored Mustang, right?
That was Virginia's.

17:51.026 --> 17:52.332
She loved that ride.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.899
- Why?
- We think it might be involved

17:54.943 --> 17:57.989
in an ongoing investigation.
Where's the car now?

17:58.033 --> 18:00.122
Her older sister, Naomi,
asked for it when she passed.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.257
Felt like I couldn't say no.

18:06.476 --> 18:08.696
Virginia's
wearing a necklace

18:08.739 --> 18:09.740
with an "N" in this photo.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.481
Yeah, for Naomi.

18:11.525 --> 18:14.093
Uh, they wore each other's
initials since they were kids.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.269
Do you know
where we can find Naomi?

18:16.312 --> 18:18.140
No. Sorry.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.405
Hospital just showed
Naomi Ashfield's

18:22.449 --> 18:25.234
photo to Brian Young. He
ID'd her as the shooter.

18:25.278 --> 18:26.757
So, what do we know
about this woman?

18:26.801 --> 18:29.064
30 years old, has about
a dozen misdemeanor charges.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.587
Bar fights and swinging at cops.

18:30.631 --> 18:32.372
Typical rap sheet
for someone who likes to drink

18:32.415 --> 18:33.503
and wants to lash out.

18:33.547 --> 18:34.765
What about an address?
Nothing.

18:34.809 --> 18:35.984
Their former employer said

18:36.027 --> 18:37.681
that she picked up her checks
in person,

18:37.725 --> 18:39.553
thought maybe she was living
out of her car.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.163
BURROWS:Warrant came through for
Naomi and Virginia's

18:41.207 --> 18:42.599
family court records.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.166
Their father went to prison
for beating their mother.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.299
Judge Walker presided
over the custody hearing,

18:46.342 --> 18:47.909
awarded them to the state.

18:47.952 --> 18:49.302
What about their mother?
The mother

18:49.345 --> 18:51.782
was institutionalized,
had a history of drug use.

18:51.826 --> 18:53.262
Well, that explains
why Naomi targeted Walker.

18:53.306 --> 18:55.830
In her eyes, he tore them
away from their mother

18:55.873 --> 18:58.485
- and put them in the system.
- Want to guess who the case worker was when they entered

18:58.528 --> 18:59.573
- foster care?
- Brian Young.

18:59.616 --> 19:00.835
Well, according to her ex,

19:00.878 --> 19:02.576
Virginia's
foster care experience

19:02.619 --> 19:03.968
was a nightmare. You got to
figure it was the same

19:04.012 --> 19:05.970
- for Naomi.
- So, Virginia's suicide

19:06.014 --> 19:08.712
was the final straw. Now
Naomi's on a revenge mission,

19:08.756 --> 19:10.323
going after the people she
blames for their suffering.

19:10.366 --> 19:12.020
If that's the case,
their former foster parents

19:12.063 --> 19:14.414
- could be targets.
- Beth and Gregory Price.

19:14.457 --> 19:16.155
Looks like they're no longer
foster parenting.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.982
Current address
puts them in Bakersfield.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.375
Better alert Bakersfield PD

19:19.419 --> 19:20.811
to check on them ASAP.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.639
And let's get Naomi's photo
out to all patrol units.

19:24.598 --> 19:27.253
Thanks for coming
- in, April.
- Yeah.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.472
Your brother
talks a lot about you.

19:29.516 --> 19:32.214
But I-I did already give
- my statement to the detective.
- Yeah,

19:32.258 --> 19:34.347
about that. I got...
I got it right here.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.000
Um...

19:37.219 --> 19:38.960
Okay, you wrote
that you had no prior knowledge

19:39.003 --> 19:41.267
of the burglary
at Mr. McCauley's residence.

19:42.355 --> 19:44.008
I mean, those are
your words, right?

19:44.052 --> 19:46.054
And that's your signature
right there?

19:46.097 --> 19:47.838
Yeah. So?

19:47.882 --> 19:50.319
Well, according to my
brother's statement,

19:50.363 --> 19:53.670
he entered your ex-boyfriend's
house at your request.

19:53.714 --> 19:56.630
No, I-I would never
ask Terry to do that.

19:56.673 --> 19:59.154
No, no, he-he did that
on his own free will.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.112
Yeah.
I-I really like your brother,

20:01.156 --> 20:03.202
but he's a little unstable.

20:04.290 --> 20:07.554
Thing is
is he gave me a list earlier.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.295
Said that you wrote it for him.

20:09.338 --> 20:12.123
With all the stuff you wanted
him to get from the house.

20:12.167 --> 20:14.169
I-I don't... It sure looks like

20:14.213 --> 20:16.606
the same handwriting to me,
especially those Gs.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.173
Huh.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.610
- I don't recall at all.
- And that figurine

20:20.654 --> 20:22.873
he took... Oh, yeah, yeah.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.266
It's silly,

20:24.310 --> 20:25.920
but it had
a lot of sentimental value.

20:25.963 --> 20:27.791
My grandmother gave it to me
right before she died.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.619
I see.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.969
You know, look,
I'm not a big online shopper,

20:32.013 --> 20:35.190
but a quick search of eBay,
and I was impressed.

20:35.234 --> 20:38.715
I mean, those little things
go for upward of 20K.Wow.

20:38.759 --> 20:40.717
Yeah, no,
that-that's not why I wanted it.

20:40.761 --> 20:43.242
- It was sentimental.
- Right. The dead grandmother.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.374
- Yeah.
- Thing is

20:45.418 --> 20:47.420
I looked her up,
and it must be a miracle,

20:47.463 --> 20:48.638
'cause she's alive

20:48.682 --> 20:50.292
and well and living
in Fort Lauderdale.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.990
And she didn't know anything
about any figurine.

20:53.034 --> 20:55.384
Listen, I'm sure your ex

20:55.428 --> 20:57.299
McCauley deserved it.

20:57.343 --> 21:00.128
But my brother, Terry?

21:00.171 --> 21:02.783
He's just a fool in love.

21:02.826 --> 21:05.525
And if he's going down for this,

21:05.568 --> 21:07.483
you're going down, too.

21:09.485 --> 21:11.313
Remember what I said.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.227
Yo!

21:12.271 --> 21:13.750
- What?
- LUCA:Terry,

21:13.794 --> 21:15.796
chill out, man. We're just
having a little conversation.

21:15.839 --> 21:18.364
You kidding me? April,
would you mind waiting outside

21:18.407 --> 21:20.017
while I talk
to my little big brother?

21:20.061 --> 21:22.455
- Course.
- Thanks.

21:22.498 --> 21:24.239
- What are you doing?
- Look, I'm trying

21:24.283 --> 21:26.197
to get you
out of a bad situation.

21:26.241 --> 21:28.199
Oh, well, thank you
for coming to the rescue,

21:28.243 --> 21:30.071
- Officer Luca.
- That woman is bad news.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.986
If you don't see it,
you're either an idiot

21:32.029 --> 21:34.031
- or you're pretending to be one.
- All right, stop it!

21:34.075 --> 21:35.685
I'm tired
of you trying to fix my life

21:35.729 --> 21:37.165
so that you can feel better
about your own,

21:37.208 --> 21:39.036
- bro.
- Terry, I'm not trying...

21:39.080 --> 21:40.124
Shut up!

21:40.168 --> 21:41.865
Just shut up.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.868
Leave me alone, man.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.486
Commander, Naomi Ashfield
has over a dozen

21:53.529 --> 21:55.401
unpaid parking citations.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.751
- For the Mustang?
- No. They're all for an RV.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.361
Overnight parking violations

21:59.405 --> 22:00.841
in the same abandoned lot
in Castaic.

22:00.884 --> 22:02.190
It could be
where she's been living.

22:02.233 --> 22:04.148
All right, tell Hondo
20-Squad needs to roll.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.236
I'll make sure
you have a warrant

22:05.280 --> 22:06.586
by the time you get there.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.810
Make and model look like
a match for Naomi's RV.

22:13.854 --> 22:16.247
No sign of the Mustang, but
she might've ditched it by now.

22:16.291 --> 22:18.075
Doesn't mean she's not in there.

22:24.473 --> 22:27.389
Naomi Ashfield. It's the LAPD.

22:27.433 --> 22:28.825
We have a warrant.

22:28.869 --> 22:30.523
We need you to come out
with your hands in the air.

22:30.566 --> 22:32.438
Chris.

22:40.402 --> 22:41.795
LAPD!

22:48.845 --> 22:50.543
Clear.

22:52.545 --> 22:53.633
RV's clear, Luca.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.722
- Hold your position.
- All right, copy.

23:00.466 --> 23:01.858
Find anything, Deacon?

23:01.902 --> 23:03.207
Maybe.

23:03.251 --> 23:06.123
This box must have
belonged to Virginia.

23:06.167 --> 23:07.951
Mail's got her name on it.

23:15.742 --> 23:16.699
It's Virginia's journal.

23:19.659 --> 23:22.575
I can't imagine
living out here like this.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.533
It's so isolated.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.883
Hard childhood like hers,

23:26.927 --> 23:28.885
I don't blame her
for wanting to escape.

23:28.929 --> 23:30.496
Makes you think, though.

23:30.539 --> 23:33.063
I mean, so many people so alone.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.372
If you're lucky enough
to find someone to be with...

23:38.504 --> 23:41.376
...maybe someone
you're meant to be with,

23:41.420 --> 23:44.771
it could be foolish
to push that away.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.211
Just saying.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.261
Yo. That's the Mustang.

23:57.305 --> 23:59.176
It's got to be Naomi.
Hondo, Mustang's here.

23:59.220 --> 24:00.961
Go get her.

24:12.842 --> 24:14.148
Don't lose her, Tan.

24:14.191 --> 24:15.105
I wasn't planning on it.

24:58.105 --> 24:59.933
22-David. We lost her.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.935
I can't believe she did that.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.240
She's got nothing left to lose.

25:14.121 --> 25:16.340
Just got off the phone
with Bakersfield PD.

25:16.384 --> 25:18.908
Virginia and Naomi's
former foster parents?

25:18.952 --> 25:22.129
Just found dead, murdered,
at least 18 hours ago.

25:22.172 --> 25:23.957
They must have been
Naomi's first victims.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.262
By the time she got
to Judge Walker,

25:25.306 --> 25:26.699
she was already on a rampage.

25:26.742 --> 25:28.527
The question is,
who's she going after next?

25:28.570 --> 25:30.137
We've already gone through
Virginia's journal,

25:30.180 --> 25:31.573
ID'd other potential targets.

25:31.617 --> 25:33.096
A high school boyfriend
who cheated on her,

25:33.140 --> 25:34.576
an employer who fired her.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.273
We're putting patrol units
on anyone who might be

25:36.317 --> 25:37.492
in Naomi's crosshairs.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.015
But I don't think that's it.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.539
Naomi knows
she's running out of time.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.236
My guess is she's gonna skip
the retribution

25:42.279 --> 25:43.498
and jump right
to her final plan.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.065
And you think
you know what that is?

25:45.108 --> 25:47.023
This is Naomi's laptop.

25:47.067 --> 25:49.548
For the last month, she's
bombarded adoption agencies

25:49.591 --> 25:50.853
with inquiries, trying
to find a child.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.812
According to her journal,
Virginia got pregnant

25:52.855 --> 25:55.641
as a teenager and gave
the baby up for adoption.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.730
- She say who the father was?
- Her foster dad Gregory Price.

25:57.773 --> 26:00.602
Ah, geez, the
sick son of a bitch.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.169
Well, that explains
why he and his wife

26:02.212 --> 26:03.387
were Naomi's first targets.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.172
And now she's out
trying to find the niece.

26:05.215 --> 26:07.348
Just got a tip
from a private investigator.

26:07.391 --> 26:09.480
He recognized Naomi's
face from the news.

26:09.524 --> 26:11.178
Says she hired him to track down

26:11.221 --> 26:13.006
the family who
adopted a young girl.

26:13.049 --> 26:15.443
Couple are Richard and Julia
Miller. They live in Valencia.

26:15.486 --> 26:17.271
The girl's name
is Jamie. She's 12.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.273
And if Naomi already knows
where the girl is?

26:19.316 --> 26:20.709
She's got a big
head start on us.

26:20.753 --> 26:22.145
I'll get the exact address
from the investigator,

26:22.189 --> 26:24.278
I'll text it to you
on the way. Go, go.

26:24.321 --> 26:26.454
We'll be faster
taking the Chargers.

26:44.341 --> 26:46.082
Richard Miller.

26:46.126 --> 26:47.780
Yeah, that's me.

26:47.823 --> 26:49.433
What can I do for you?

26:49.477 --> 26:51.697
I'm looking for Jamie.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.568
I'm sorry, do I know you?

26:53.612 --> 26:55.265
Why are you looking
for my daughter?

26:55.309 --> 26:58.181
Because she's my niece.

26:59.356 --> 27:01.358
Okay, you know what?
You need to leave.

27:01.402 --> 27:03.491
I don't know what you're after
or why you're here,

27:03.534 --> 27:04.753
but you have to go.

27:04.797 --> 27:06.015
Not without Jamie.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.239
Command to 20-David.
Neighbor just reported

27:12.282 --> 27:14.023
hearing gunshots
from the Miller home.

27:14.067 --> 27:15.242
I'm sending backup

27:15.285 --> 27:16.460
and an R/A now.

27:16.504 --> 27:18.549
Roger that. We're almost there.

27:18.593 --> 27:20.987
Keep them on standby, a block
away, until we're on scene.

27:35.001 --> 27:36.611
It's Naomi's Mustang.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.786
She beat us here.

27:37.830 --> 27:39.048
Deacon, Street,
take the three side.

27:39.092 --> 27:40.702
Everyone else with me.

27:52.540 --> 27:54.020
Luca, Tan, clear the house.

27:54.063 --> 27:55.674
LUCA:Got it.

28:06.772 --> 28:07.729
Ma'am.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.209
We're LAPD SWAT.

28:09.252 --> 28:11.602
We're here to help.

28:11.646 --> 28:13.604
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Please.

28:13.648 --> 28:14.780
Help him.

28:14.823 --> 28:16.477
He's alive, but losing blood.

28:16.520 --> 28:17.608
Rest of the house is clear.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.306
Roger. 24-David to Command.

28:19.349 --> 28:21.090
Release the R/A.
We need paramedics fast.

28:21.134 --> 28:23.571
What happened here?
Uh, she shot him.

28:23.614 --> 28:24.920
And then she took our daughter.

28:24.964 --> 28:26.139
How long ago did they leave?

28:26.182 --> 28:27.706
Just a few minutes ago.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.709
She kept saying
something about Oregon.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.406
Her car's still outside. She
probably took your husband's.

28:32.449 --> 28:33.624
- What does he drive?
- Um...

28:33.668 --> 28:35.626
A Camry. Silver.

28:37.585 --> 28:38.804
One male victim

28:38.847 --> 28:40.501
with multiple GSWs.

28:40.544 --> 28:42.024
Listen to me,
these people are gonna take

28:42.068 --> 28:43.330
good care of both of you, okay?

28:43.373 --> 28:45.462
Okay. Thank you.

28:45.506 --> 28:47.247
Let's move. 20-David to Command.

28:47.290 --> 28:49.684
Naomi's kidnapped
the Millers' daughter.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.556
They're in a silver Toyota
Camry, probably headed north.

28:52.600 --> 28:55.908
Copy that, Hondo.
We'll get you air support ASAP

28:55.951 --> 28:57.605
and notify Burrows
to put out an Amber Alert.

28:57.648 --> 29:00.042
Girl's mother said she thinks
Naomi's taking Jamie north.

29:00.086 --> 29:01.783
Best we can do is split
the routes and keep driving.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.785
Hope air support spots them.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.482
Okay, then, let's move. Go.

29:07.963 --> 29:10.966
D-Don't worry,
it's all gonna be okay.

29:13.534 --> 29:15.797
You look just like her.
It's crazy.

29:15.841 --> 29:17.364
You look just like your mom.

29:17.407 --> 29:19.670
Just...

29:19.714 --> 29:22.673
Just let me go. Please.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.898
Command to 20-David.
Air units have the suspect's car

29:29.942 --> 29:31.421
spotted north of your position.

29:31.465 --> 29:34.773
Roger. Deac, Luca,
reroute to the northbound 5.

29:36.644 --> 29:38.515
Do you, do you like horses?

29:38.559 --> 29:40.866
I have an aunt in
Oregon, with a farm.

29:40.909 --> 29:43.216
You're gonna like it there.
I know you will.

29:43.259 --> 29:44.434
We can ride every day.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.262
And I can tell you

29:46.306 --> 29:47.307
all about your mother.

29:55.228 --> 29:57.012
Okay, hold on.

29:57.056 --> 29:58.535
We're gonna make
a little detour.

29:59.754 --> 30:01.060
Right there, Hondo!

30:01.103 --> 30:02.191
She turned right there.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.544
20-David to Command,
suspect just turned right

30:07.588 --> 30:09.590
on Canyon Road, headed east.

30:09.633 --> 30:12.419
Copy that. I'll have LAPD
station a barricade

30:12.462 --> 30:13.812
on the other side of the canyon.

30:13.855 --> 30:15.552
Keep her headed that way.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.098
Unis have her blocked.

30:39.141 --> 30:40.099
Let's hope.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.580
She's not slowing.

30:53.373 --> 30:54.591
Naomi!

30:59.814 --> 31:01.729
Cover!

31:03.078 --> 31:04.558
Naomi, you and Jamie
got to get out

31:04.601 --> 31:05.559
of that car before it falls!

31:05.602 --> 31:07.996
Please, get out now!

31:08.040 --> 31:10.172
Stay back! I'll shoot
anyone who comes near.

31:21.401 --> 31:22.881
Somebody help me!

31:22.924 --> 31:24.534
- Please!
- Naomi!

31:24.578 --> 31:27.059
I'm warning you. Stay away!

31:27.102 --> 31:29.844
All right! All right,
we won't come any closer.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.281
But you both have
to get out of the car now.

31:32.325 --> 31:33.630
That guardrail won't hold.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.676
My sister was only 15

31:35.719 --> 31:39.898
when that disgusting pig
raped her and got her pregnant.

31:39.941 --> 31:41.812
And-and he made
her feel like

31:41.856 --> 31:42.988
it was her fault.

31:43.031 --> 31:45.425
She lived her life
ashamed of it.

31:45.468 --> 31:48.428
That must've been horrible,
but you already made him pay.

31:48.471 --> 31:50.125
You took care of that.

31:50.169 --> 31:51.605
Now give up the gun,

31:51.648 --> 31:53.346
and let us get you and
Jamie out of the car.

31:53.389 --> 31:55.522
No. No.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.263
Jamie's all I have left
of Virginia.

31:57.306 --> 31:58.829
She needs to stay with me.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.092
Somebody, please!

32:00.135 --> 32:01.484
Naomi, listen to me.

32:01.528 --> 32:02.790
I didn't know Virginia,

32:02.833 --> 32:04.792
but I'm sure she wouldn't
want her child to die,

32:04.835 --> 32:06.794
so don't let that happen.

32:06.837 --> 32:09.144
Think about what Virginia
would want right now.

32:21.069 --> 32:23.680
Okay, fine.

32:23.724 --> 32:24.986
Get Jamie out.

32:25.030 --> 32:26.770
Move in.

32:31.384 --> 32:32.994
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.169
- Let's go.
- I'm stuck.

32:36.519 --> 32:37.564
All right, let's go.
You got her?

32:37.607 --> 32:39.392
Go, come on. I got Jamie!

32:39.435 --> 32:41.046
Okay. Now you, Naomi.

32:41.089 --> 32:43.787
Come on.
Climb to the passenger side.

32:47.226 --> 32:48.183
Come on, Naomi.

32:48.227 --> 32:49.445
You got to get out.

32:49.489 --> 32:53.014
No. It was my fault,
Virginia's death.

32:53.058 --> 32:54.189
I-I should've done more.

32:54.233 --> 32:56.452
We're running out of time.
This is gonna go.

32:57.801 --> 32:59.020
Luca, you got to
get her out, man.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.543
We were sisters.

33:00.587 --> 33:02.806
There has to have been
more I could've done.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.199
Come on, Naomi,

33:04.243 --> 33:06.158
you can't carry that weight
on your shoulders.

33:06.201 --> 33:08.160
She was your sister, yeah,

33:08.203 --> 33:10.640
but what she did,
you couldn't control that.

33:11.772 --> 33:14.122
I know you loved her,
and you wanted the best for her,

33:14.166 --> 33:15.994
but sometimes,
that's all we can do.

33:17.778 --> 33:19.649
Now give me your hand, Naomi.

33:19.693 --> 33:20.911
Come on.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.392
Please.

33:23.436 --> 33:25.742
You can't keep
torturing yourself.

33:25.786 --> 33:27.831
Come on. You can't.

33:30.399 --> 33:32.097
It's time. Come on.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.315
Grab on.

33:55.381 --> 33:57.339
Nice work.

33:57.383 --> 33:59.124
I guess, right?

33:59.167 --> 34:01.082
I mean, that was close.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.389
I know that came from
the heart, man. You did good.

34:08.133 --> 34:10.091
Richard Miller made
it through surgery,

34:10.135 --> 34:12.528
so looks like Jamie's gonna
have a happy home to go back to.

34:12.572 --> 34:13.964
I'm glad to hear that.

34:14.008 --> 34:15.575
You got to wonder, though,
if Virginia and Naomi

34:15.618 --> 34:18.056
had had the same,
none of this happens.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.448
Probably not.

34:19.492 --> 34:21.233
We weren't able
to help Virginia and Naomi,

34:21.276 --> 34:23.365
but we were able
to help Jamie, so...

34:23.409 --> 34:25.933
we'll just have to
take that as a win.

34:25.976 --> 34:27.543
Yeah.

34:29.980 --> 34:31.156
Commander.

34:32.896 --> 34:35.203
Again, I'm very sorry
about your friend.

34:35.247 --> 34:37.118
Well...

34:37.162 --> 34:38.598
Thanks.

34:47.346 --> 34:48.564
Maggie?

34:49.652 --> 34:50.697
Claire let me in.

34:50.740 --> 34:52.568
Uh, I hope that's all right.

34:52.612 --> 34:54.048
I understand
if you want to be alone.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.919
No, no. Please.

34:58.052 --> 35:00.924
I just, um...

35:00.968 --> 35:02.752
thought you'd want to know.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.972
We found the person
who killed Martin.

35:05.015 --> 35:07.322
She was emotionally sick.

35:07.366 --> 35:08.541
There's nothing
you or Marty

35:08.584 --> 35:10.282
could've done differently.

35:10.325 --> 35:11.979
Nothing.

35:13.807 --> 35:15.113
How are you doing?

35:17.115 --> 35:18.464
I don't know.

35:19.900 --> 35:21.075
I...

35:21.119 --> 35:23.556
I just feel numb.

35:26.298 --> 35:28.387
You know,
when Barb passed, uh...

35:29.475 --> 35:31.868
...weeks went by, I...

35:31.912 --> 35:33.261
I didn't cry.

35:33.305 --> 35:35.742
It just, uh...

35:35.785 --> 35:37.570
It was strange.

35:37.613 --> 35:40.442
Then, one night,
I was in the grocery store,

35:40.486 --> 35:43.576
you know,
getting a frozen pizza,

35:43.619 --> 35:44.968
'cause I couldn't handle eating

35:45.012 --> 35:47.754
another neighbor's
soggy casserole.

35:47.797 --> 35:49.930
Is that what I have
to look forward to?

35:49.973 --> 35:52.541
I hope not.

35:52.585 --> 35:55.718
When, uh, all of a sudden,
that Hall & Oates song,

35:55.762 --> 35:58.330
"Rich Girl," came on
over the speakers.

35:58.373 --> 35:59.592
It just took me back

35:59.635 --> 36:01.376
to this bar in Playa del Rey

36:01.420 --> 36:03.117
where Barb and I had
our second date.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.814
I remember.

36:04.858 --> 36:06.686
It wasn't the classiest joint,
but, you know--

36:06.729 --> 36:09.167
to take a date to,
but that's... that's me.

36:09.210 --> 36:12.344
Well, you know, that kind
of thing didn't matter to Barb.

36:12.387 --> 36:14.128
We had her first kiss there.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.262
That night at the bar.

36:17.305 --> 36:19.829
"Rich Girl" playing
in the background.

36:19.873 --> 36:22.223
So now,

36:22.267 --> 36:25.792
there I am, almost...

36:25.835 --> 36:29.317
gosh, 30 years later,

36:29.361 --> 36:32.015
standing in the freezer aisle
at a grocery store,

36:32.059 --> 36:35.932
just looking at frozen pizzas.

36:35.976 --> 36:38.892
I must have looked
like I was out of my mind,

36:38.935 --> 36:41.068
'cause this employee
came up to me and he asked me--

36:41.111 --> 36:45.420
very nicely,
just, you know--

36:45.464 --> 36:47.640
"Is everything all right?"

36:48.728 --> 36:50.120
And that was it.

36:50.164 --> 36:52.732
I mean, I just started
bawling like a baby.

36:52.775 --> 36:55.300
I ran out of there
as fast as I could.

36:55.343 --> 36:58.825
It just, it just hit me
out of nowhere.

36:58.868 --> 37:01.001
So...

37:02.829 --> 37:06.311
...if you need anyone
to talk to or to cry to

37:06.354 --> 37:10.358
or to stand
in the freezer aisle with,

37:10.402 --> 37:13.143
I'm here. I'm the guy.

37:13.187 --> 37:15.494
Okay?

37:17.757 --> 37:19.933
Thank you.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.935
Oh, Maggie.

37:25.112 --> 37:27.114
I can't believe he's gone.

37:27.157 --> 37:29.116
I'm so sorry.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.730
I'm so sorry.
Thank you.

37:37.037 --> 37:38.995
Hey, Pop, I'm home.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.823
You didn't forget
those egg rolls, did you?

37:40.867 --> 37:43.391
Of course not. You know
you'd send me back if I did.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.175
Hey, listen.

37:45.219 --> 37:48.222
I want to talk to you
for a second.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.702
I spoke to Barbara earlier.

37:49.745 --> 37:51.356
The realtor. She says
you haven't shown up

37:51.399 --> 37:52.835
to see any of
the apartments.

37:52.879 --> 37:54.359
Now, look, before
you say anything,

37:54.402 --> 37:56.491
I want to tell you something.

37:56.535 --> 37:58.711
Spending the last
few years together

37:58.754 --> 38:01.844
has meant a whole lot to me.

38:01.888 --> 38:03.672
Probably more
than I can express.

38:03.716 --> 38:05.674
But the last thing I want
is you feeling like

38:05.718 --> 38:07.110
I'm kicking you out
because I don't care,

38:07.154 --> 38:08.503
'cause that ain't it.
And just because

38:08.547 --> 38:09.722
you ain't living here
doesn't mean

38:09.765 --> 38:11.376
you can't walk through
that door anytime.

38:11.419 --> 38:13.813
Especially when you might have
a grandkid to come visit.

38:13.856 --> 38:16.163
Let me stop you right there.

38:16.206 --> 38:17.773
I'm not afraid to move out.

38:17.817 --> 38:20.733
I'm happy to give you
your space.

38:20.776 --> 38:24.040
And the reason I bailed
on the realtor is because

38:24.084 --> 38:26.347
I kind of already
got a place in mind.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.828
What are you talking about?
Where?

38:28.871 --> 38:30.525
Your mama's house.

38:32.266 --> 38:33.833
I didn't want
to talk to you

38:33.876 --> 38:36.183
until I talked to her
about it first.

38:36.226 --> 38:38.577
And we've agreed,
we're gonna give it a try.

38:38.620 --> 38:41.014
I just didn't know how
you were gonna feel about it.

38:42.407 --> 38:44.234
You planning on hurting my mom?

38:44.278 --> 38:45.584
Never.

38:45.627 --> 38:47.063
And I know that.

38:47.107 --> 38:49.327
So we ain't got no problems.

38:49.370 --> 38:51.154
- Let's eat.
- Good.

38:51.198 --> 38:53.374
All right.

38:53.418 --> 38:54.854
Now, give me the fried rice.

38:54.897 --> 38:57.378
- Fried rice, bang.
- Ah, yes.

38:57.422 --> 38:58.988
I better get one
of these egg rolls, now.

38:59.032 --> 39:00.903
- You be hogging.
- Over my dead body.

39:00.947 --> 39:02.122
Okay, watch this.

39:02.165 --> 39:03.123
What you doing? What you doing?

39:03.166 --> 39:04.342
- H-Hold on.
- Mm-hmm.

39:04.385 --> 39:05.560
- See, that's the problem.
- Mm-hmm.

39:05.604 --> 39:08.084
Always want to hog
the egg rolls.

39:13.002 --> 39:14.221
Hold up.

39:17.224 --> 39:20.358
Oh, hey. Come on in.

39:20.401 --> 39:21.750
- Thanks.
- Yeah, yeah.

39:29.018 --> 39:32.370
So, I got a call from my lawyer.

39:32.413 --> 39:36.417
They dropped the charges
down to misdemeanor trespassing.

39:36.461 --> 39:37.897
All I got to do
is pay a fine.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.942
Glad to hear it, man.

39:39.986 --> 39:41.640
You called the D.A.?

39:43.293 --> 39:44.382
I guess a thank-you's in order.

39:44.425 --> 39:45.774
It's all good, man.

39:45.818 --> 39:47.907
Just didn't want to see you
in an orange jumpsuit.

39:47.950 --> 39:49.517
I don't think
it's really your color.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.043
Terry...

39:57.612 --> 40:01.311
...I'm sorry for talking
to April behind your back.

40:01.355 --> 40:03.357
Thanks for saying that.

40:06.229 --> 40:08.188
You know, it's...

40:08.231 --> 40:10.669
it's funny.

40:10.712 --> 40:16.326
I've always admired, like,
how clear you've been,

40:16.370 --> 40:19.895
like, who you are, what you
believe in, what you stand for.

40:19.939 --> 40:21.723
You've been that way
ever since you were a kid.

40:21.767 --> 40:26.249
But that's the part
that hurts the most,

40:26.293 --> 40:29.339
just knowing that
someone that you idolize

40:29.383 --> 40:32.517
just doesn't respect you back.

40:32.560 --> 40:34.388
Terry, I-I respect you.

40:36.390 --> 40:37.739
I respect you.

40:37.783 --> 40:41.177
I mean, you are
one of the most...

40:42.744 --> 40:46.966
...interesting, creative people
that I know.

40:48.881 --> 40:52.450
And what you said
before is true.

40:52.493 --> 40:55.409
Who am I to judge?

40:55.453 --> 40:56.845
It's not like I have my
life totally together.

40:56.889 --> 40:59.152
I mean, come on, man,
I'm a middle-aged man

40:59.195 --> 41:01.763
living with a roommate
and a pinball machine.

41:01.807 --> 41:04.200
Uh, yeah, well, you know,

41:04.244 --> 41:08.161
that's what they call
living the dream, man.

41:11.556 --> 41:12.948
But...

41:17.344 --> 41:19.738
...I'm proud to be your brother.

41:23.350 --> 41:26.266
Same here. Same here.

41:26.309 --> 41:27.485
I'm sorry.

41:27.528 --> 41:29.965
No. I love you.

41:32.011 --> 41:33.447
A-All right.

41:33.491 --> 41:34.927
All right, get off me, man.

41:36.406 --> 41:39.061
You want to go to O'Brians?
Play some darts?

41:39.105 --> 41:41.934
Yeah. Well, no, I-I got to...

41:41.977 --> 41:44.719
April and I, we're taking
off for the weekend, so...

41:44.763 --> 41:47.548
Dude, she is bad news.

41:47.592 --> 41:48.767
Yeah.

41:48.810 --> 41:51.596
In the best possible way.

41:51.639 --> 41:52.814
All right, then.

41:52.858 --> 41:55.643
I'll see you
on the flip side, brother.

41:57.166 --> 41:59.908
