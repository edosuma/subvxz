WEBVTT

00:55.931 --> 00:57.432
Motherfucker!

02:15.093 --> 02:16.094
What if she's a psycho?

02:16.720 --> 02:19.848
She hunted you down in ShopRite
and put a shrunken head in your hands.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.183
She's definitely a psycho.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.563
This isn't a good idea.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.315
- We should go.
- Are you kidding?

02:28.315 --> 02:30.108
Dude, we're finally
gonna get some answers.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.361
Like, who is she,
how is she connected to your brother,

02:32.361 --> 02:35.405
why did she come all the way out to Nyack
to give you a shrunken head.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.032
We are not going anywhere.

02:37.616 --> 02:39.117
- She's late.
- So?

02:39.618 --> 02:41.995
- So it's rude. We should go.
- Dude, you need to relax.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.595
- Hey.
- You showed up.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.722
Yeah, it wasn't a big deal.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.225
Anyway, hey.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.519
Hi. Hey.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.524
I didn't know you were bringing someone.

03:11.108 --> 03:14.486
I'm sorry. I hope it's okay.
She's-- This is my neighbor.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.615
- It's Shay. Nice to meet you.
- You too.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.450
So, we're gonna sneak in.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.830
- Isn't that illegal?
- No, it's fine. We'll do it.

03:25.455 --> 03:29.376
Okay. When I go, go. Don't hesitate.
Don't meet anyone's eye.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.253
Don't look guilty. This is perfect.

03:33.881 --> 03:34.882
Come on.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.605
- Sir?
- Now!

03:53.525 --> 03:55.819
Not bad. Little criminals, huh?

03:56.904 --> 03:58.322
Yeah, no big deal.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.865
I think I just had a heart attack.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.033
Follow me.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.752
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

04:11.752 --> 04:16.714
Oh, come on. More ferocious.
Ready? Fee-fi-fo-fum!

04:16.714 --> 04:19.468
Fee-fi-fo-fum!

04:19.468 --> 04:21.595
Yes! I'm terrified.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.639
Uncle Kojo, you do one.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.225
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

04:29.353 --> 04:30.646
Show him how it's done.

04:30.646 --> 04:33.106
Fee-fi-fo-fum!

04:33.106 --> 04:35.150
Yes. You crushed it.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.694
You are a magnificent giant.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.489
You're coming too, right?

04:41.448 --> 04:42.449
I--

04:42.449 --> 04:45.410
Niece, Adriana's very busy
with the campaign and all--

04:45.410 --> 04:48.664
But you have to be there.
You have to see my new costume.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.501
Then I'll be there.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.794
It's okay. We d--

04:53.794 --> 04:55.420
Kojo, I wouldn't miss this for anything.

04:55.921 --> 04:58.757
Okay, wanna try again? Ready?
Give it to me. Go.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.592
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.220
Add the steps. Big steps. Go. Again.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.222
Fee-fi-fo-fum!

05:12.688 --> 05:14.565
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.068
Hello?

05:24.283 --> 05:26.535
Oh, God. Hi. It's just Dee Dee.

05:26.535 --> 05:29.454
- Yeah. Sorry.
- Steve, right?

05:29.454 --> 05:30.747
You all right?

05:30.747 --> 05:33.834
Holy shit. I mean, sorry. You okay?

05:35.252 --> 05:37.838
- I should leave.
- Can I-- Let me help you.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.256
Oh, no.

05:43.218 --> 05:45.596
That's a shiner.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.473
Let me-- You know what, let's--

05:48.473 --> 05:51.018
Let me clean you up.
Let's go to the bathroom.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.561
Come on.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.771
- All right.
- Okay. Oh, boy.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.441
Rough night, huh?

05:58.817 --> 06:00.360
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.821
Did you go to cosmetology school
or something?

06:03.614 --> 06:07.242
No, this is just years of practice.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.327
Sorry, does that hurt?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.663
All right, come on. Fess up.
What the hell happened to you?

06:12.748 --> 06:14.541
I got into a bar fight.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.920
- A ba--
- Yeah.

06:17.920 --> 06:21.465
Aren't you, like, a gazillionaire?
Do gazillionaires get into bar fights?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.592
I...

06:23.592 --> 06:28.263
I couldn't face my fiancée, and I think
I deserved a punch in the face.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.308
Okay.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.769
Yeah, I've had some wild nights.

06:34.311 --> 06:37.856
Don't think I ever ended up
passed out in a church basement though.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.237
But I figure, if you can't be a wreck
in front of the man upstairs,

06:43.237 --> 06:44.571
what can you do, you know?

06:44.571 --> 06:45.572
- What--
- Move.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.657
What--

06:47.449 --> 06:49.117
Splashed.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.413
You all right? Oh, boy.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.831
I'm gonna take this off.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.416
Okay.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.418
It was last season anyway.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.046
'Kay.

07:05.342 --> 07:06.635
You okay?

07:07.344 --> 07:08.720
You need water and a cupcake.

07:09.972 --> 07:10.973
Brb.

07:19.815 --> 07:23.026
So, why did you come to the supermarket
and give Edward the shrunken head?

07:23.026 --> 07:25.153
- Shay.
- What?

07:25.153 --> 07:27.364
I'm sorry. You don't have to--

07:27.364 --> 07:28.574
No, it's okay.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.202
Look, I'm sorry if I freaked you out.

07:32.786 --> 07:36.331
I just-- I was confused.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.333
Yeah. It's okay.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.419
Seriously?

07:41.837 --> 07:43.422
- What?
- Have you seen the locks yet?

07:44.006 --> 07:46.258
They're way less creepy.
Come on. I'll show you.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.177
We'll be right back, okay?

07:49.303 --> 07:51.013
Yeah, sure.

07:53.265 --> 07:55.350
So, Jordan was your boyfriend?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.978
Yeah, he was.

07:58.562 --> 07:59.897
And you guys came here together?

08:00.564 --> 08:01.565
All the time.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.651
That's where we had our first kiss.

08:16.747 --> 08:18.540
That's where we had our first argument.

08:25.714 --> 08:28.008
<i>No, I'm not saying
we're breaking up, I'm just--</i>

08:28.008 --> 08:29.760
<i>You're moving across the country.</i>

08:29.760 --> 08:31.929
- <i>We'll FaceTime and text every day.</i>
- <i>It's not the same.</i>

08:31.929 --> 08:33.472
<i>You think I wanna move to LA?</i>

08:34.056 --> 08:36.183
So, why didn't he tell me about you?

08:37.433 --> 08:38.434
He told me everything.

08:39.227 --> 08:43.273
I needed it to be secret.
My uncle doesn't let me go out with boys.

08:43.273 --> 08:47.986
My family is this cultural stereotype.
But Jordan wanted it to be secret too.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.613
But he could have trusted me.

08:50.822 --> 08:52.533
I wouldn't have told our parents.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.867
He didn't want anyone to know.

08:56.537 --> 09:01.083
You mean me? So he--
So Jordan hated me or something?

09:01.083 --> 09:04.086
No, he loved you
more than anything, Eddie.

09:04.086 --> 09:06.421
And anytime he'd talk about you, he just--

09:07.297 --> 09:09.299
He'd have this huge smile on his face.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.347
But he needed his own life.

09:16.181 --> 09:19.017
He said sometimes he didn't know
where you ended and he began.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.061
You guys shared everything.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.023
It's why he didn't wanna be
homeschooled anymore.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.733
So you knew about that too?

09:27.359 --> 09:31.530
He wanted to tell you so much, he just--
He couldn't bear to hurt you.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.325
Wait, I thought I told you
all that in my letter.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.746
- What letter?
- The one I sent you.

09:41.707 --> 09:42.833
I never got a letter.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.169
Shit.
Maybe I dropped it at the wrong house.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.839
Most of this stuff is fake.
Who would pay $30 to get into this place?

09:48.839 --> 09:50.257
I thought you loved it here.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.093
Not anymore. Can we get some food now?

09:55.137 --> 09:56.680
Yeah, sure.

09:57.639 --> 09:59.850
Maybe in a little while?

10:02.060 --> 10:03.645
Whatever. I'll meet you in the gift shop.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.647
Great. I'll be there in a few.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.066
Eddie, can I ask you something?

10:09.693 --> 10:10.694
Yeah.

10:11.236 --> 10:12.237
Could you--

10:14.781 --> 10:18.410
Could you tell me about that day,
about the flight?

10:18.410 --> 10:22.164
I just have nightmares about it,

10:23.707 --> 10:26.835
what it was like for you, for him.

10:27.794 --> 10:31.632
Look, I hope it's okay to ask.
I just-- I need to know.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.096
Head down!

10:44.394 --> 10:46.939
I blacked out.

10:50.734 --> 10:51.735
Yeah, I--

10:53.862 --> 10:54.863
And--

10:55.989 --> 10:57.282
And when I came to...

10:59.952 --> 11:01.161
I was in the hospital.

11:04.540 --> 11:07.543
I don't remember anything about that day.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.091
Sorry.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.346
You have nothing to be sorry for.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.315
<i>It's subtle,
the way that it happens, really.</i>

11:30.816 --> 11:35.112
<i>They're not like, "Hey, you're pregnant.
You're fired," because I'd sue them.</i>

11:35.112 --> 11:38.407
But they do
just give you fewer and fewer shifts.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.829
And eventually, I'm gonna have to
tell my roommates that I can't make rent.

11:45.289 --> 11:49.501
Which is awkward because
ever since I got pregnant,

11:49.501 --> 11:50.752
they don't know I'm alive.

11:54.173 --> 11:55.674
So just to recap,

11:58.260 --> 11:59.303
six months pregnant,

12:00.220 --> 12:01.305
no partner,

12:03.098 --> 12:04.099
no money,

12:05.601 --> 12:10.022
no baby's room,
no crib, no stroller, and soon, no job.

12:10.814 --> 12:14.234
So, I don't even know how I got pregnant.

12:14.234 --> 12:18.697
I mean, I know how I got pregnant, but I
don't know how I got in this situation

12:18.697 --> 12:19.781
because we were...

12:20.657 --> 12:23.410
very cautious.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.079
Yeah. Not the plan.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.667
Hey, Linda.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.004
You said you don't have
all your baby stuff yet?

12:34.505 --> 12:35.631
I-- Yeah. It--

12:36.423 --> 12:38.008
- It's a lot.
- Pretty sure I can help.

12:39.968 --> 12:40.969
- Hi.
- How was your group?

12:40.969 --> 12:43.597
- Good. We're all cured.
- Well, perfect, because you are very busy.

12:44.181 --> 12:45.182
Hi, Kojo.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.518
We have to get to the panel
with NYU's Young Democrats,

12:47.518 --> 12:49.478
and that's before your five o'clock.

12:49.478 --> 12:52.231
We also added a fundraiser
tomorrow night at 6:00.

12:52.231 --> 12:54.942
- We're adding things?
- You got plans?

12:54.942 --> 12:59.029
Well, Becks is in a school play,
and I told her that I'd be there. So...

12:59.029 --> 13:00.948
This fundraiser is important.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.449
Mayor Adams will be there.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.744
Look, you nailed the debate
and the right people noticed.

13:06.245 --> 13:07.538
This is major league.

13:09.164 --> 13:10.207
I'll be in the car.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.130
You good?

13:17.840 --> 13:20.300
You just agreed to be
in two places at once,

13:20.300 --> 13:22.886
and I don't have to tell you
which place I think you will choose.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.806
- I will make it work.
- You are getting too close to her.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.142
Okay.

13:31.061 --> 13:32.563
She just lost her mother.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.941
I can see the way she looks at you.
She's growing attached.

13:39.987 --> 13:41.613
We are going to Ghana soon.

13:42.573 --> 13:44.241
You are becoming the congresswoman.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.830
Maybe we shouldn't be
around you so much anymore.

14:13.187 --> 14:14.229
Can I help you?

14:15.606 --> 14:16.899
Nope, I got it.

14:18.108 --> 14:19.443
I'm sorry. Who are you?

14:20.444 --> 14:21.695
Vernon. Who are you?

14:22.279 --> 14:23.280
Sam.

14:24.823 --> 14:27.451
- Did you know Ben?
- Yeah, I was an old friend.

14:28.452 --> 14:29.620
- You?
- Same.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.833
- What are you doing here?
- Ben let me store some of my stuff here.

14:35.334 --> 14:39.421
Okay. I'm actually-- I'm helping
his grandmother sort through all this,

14:39.421 --> 14:41.173
- so if you could--
- Clear my shit out. Yeah.

14:41.173 --> 14:43.926
- When you can.
- No problem.

14:45.260 --> 14:49.431
- How'd you know Ben?
- High school. Basketball team.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.392
Sorry, he didn't seem like a jock.

14:53.227 --> 14:54.436
Yeah, he wasn't very good.

14:57.814 --> 14:59.316
Still can't believe he's gone.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.361
He was just so beautiful.

15:04.947 --> 15:05.989
Yeah.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.701
Anyway...

15:11.036 --> 15:15.916
I'm probably gonna be shutting this place
down at the end of the month, so...

15:15.916 --> 15:18.919
Got it. Can I have your phone for a sec?

15:25.759 --> 15:27.135
We should have each other's contacts

15:27.135 --> 15:29.054
in case questions come up
on the storage unit,

15:29.972 --> 15:31.473
and if you ever need to talk.

15:32.391 --> 15:33.433
That's--

15:33.433 --> 15:36.979
I don't need to talk, s--

15:37.896 --> 15:39.189
Well, I sure as shit do.

15:40.023 --> 15:42.025
You're the first person I've seen
who knew him too.

15:45.153 --> 15:50.617
Yep. I will be in touch about,
you know, shutting this place down, s--

15:51.618 --> 15:53.412
- Good to meet you, Sam.
- Yeah, you too.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.708
Beep-beep.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.931
I'm sorry, I lied.

16:12.931 --> 16:15.392
That is not the best sleeping bag
on Earth, okay?

16:15.392 --> 16:18.228
This is the best sleeping bag on Earth.
Feel this material.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.313
Okay.

16:20.063 --> 16:21.857
- Yeah.
- Wow.

16:22.357 --> 16:25.861
- Mom, feel this. So squishy.
- That feels great.

16:25.861 --> 16:27.487
- Yeah.
- But, you know--

16:27.988 --> 16:29.781
I mean, you're not going to Antarctica.

16:30.282 --> 16:34.953
I just think we don't really need
a $700 sleeping bag, right?

16:34.953 --> 16:36.038
- Mom.
- No worries.

16:36.038 --> 16:38.290
I'll go and grab some
bags at lower price point.

16:38.290 --> 16:41.710
That would be wonderful, Erasmus.

16:41.710 --> 16:44.421
- Erasmus, yeah. Thank you.
- I like that name.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.256
- Interesting. Greek?
- My mom gave it to me.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.675
Dad always said to buy the best
and amortize the cost

16:48.675 --> 16:50.552
over total length of use.
This is the best.

16:50.552 --> 16:52.554
Well, it's a little more complicated
than that, but--

16:52.554 --> 16:55.140
- Complicated how, Mom?
- We're gonna be fine.

16:55.140 --> 16:57.768
We just need to tighten our budgets,
that's all.

16:59.102 --> 17:03.357
"Tighten our budgets?"
Those are not words that you say.

17:03.357 --> 17:06.068
I feel like this isn't the time
or the place to have this con--

17:06.068 --> 17:07.861
Mom, can you just tell me what's going on?

17:07.861 --> 17:08.779
What's going on is,

17:08.779 --> 17:11.448
your father and I spent our lives
so you could go to college.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.992
- Is this really about--
- I don't want you to throw that away

17:13.992 --> 17:17.079
traipsing around the world
in the most expensive sleeping bag

17:17.079 --> 17:18.247
because your father's dead.

17:18.247 --> 17:21.583
God, mom. I told you that this
is what I need to do, okay?

17:21.583 --> 17:24.419
And you said that you would support me,
and you are not supporting me.

17:25.671 --> 17:28.632
Honey, your father died.

17:29.258 --> 17:32.219
And I know you wanna run away.
I wanna run away too. I do.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.638
But life has to go on.

17:34.638 --> 17:36.473
We have to keep living our lives,

17:36.473 --> 17:39.017
and we have to,
like, face the grief and the pain.

17:40.936 --> 17:42.187
You can't run away from that.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.693
He was my best friend.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.489
I know.

17:54.533 --> 17:55.617
I know.

17:57.494 --> 17:58.495
I know.

18:05.377 --> 18:06.378
Hey.

18:07.880 --> 18:08.922
Hey.

18:27.065 --> 18:28.317
I need to apologize.

18:31.361 --> 18:32.571
Okay.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.199
I think I messed
this whole Mahira thing up.

18:35.199 --> 18:37.034
I mean, she told me so much,

18:37.034 --> 18:39.536
and I couldn't give her
the one thing she asked for.

18:39.536 --> 18:42.247
And now she might not wanna
ever talk to me again.

18:42.915 --> 18:43.999
I guess there's no point.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.418
I don't know what to do.

18:49.004 --> 18:50.130
What do you think?

18:54.134 --> 18:55.344
You're an asshole, Edward.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.373
Fuck.

19:31.380 --> 19:35.425
I'm so thrilled that you're here.
Those are lovely.

19:35.425 --> 19:36.885
Thank you for inviting me.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.264
Wow, this place is crazy.

19:40.264 --> 19:44.268
I know. We got really lucky.
Please make yourself at home.

19:45.811 --> 19:47.187
You're here.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.773
I'm gonna put these in water.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.400
Steve, pour Amanda some wine.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.986
- I love that jacket, by the way.
- Thank you.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.905
Why did you show up?

19:56.905 --> 20:00.242
You really think I wanna be here?
She texted me, like, ten times.

20:00.742 --> 20:03.579
- And you're ghosting me. What the fuck?
- Eat, have dessert, then leave.

20:03.579 --> 20:05.914
Don't let her pull you
into a deep conversation.

20:05.914 --> 20:09.376
Trust me, the second I get a chance
to be out of here, I'm gone.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.671
- What the hell happened to your eye?
- Bar fight.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.131
You? When?

20:14.882 --> 20:16.925
Last night, after I left you.

20:19.178 --> 20:21.555
Hey. Ready to eat?

20:22.973 --> 20:25.267
I'm so grateful you guys have that group.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.144
I had to basically force Steve to join it.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.979
- Right, honey?
- She did.

20:30.564 --> 20:32.357
Oh, my God. Your eye's getting worse.

20:32.983 --> 20:36.570
I go away for two days
and he decides to take boxing lessons.

20:39.865 --> 20:41.700
I can't imagine what you're going through.

20:42.951 --> 20:45.662
If I lost Steve,
I'd crumble into a million pieces.

20:52.586 --> 20:54.963
Yeah, I should probably go home.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.132
- I'll call you a Lyft.
- Oh, no, don't go.

20:57.132 --> 21:00.135
I'm so sorry.
I promised Steve I'd keep it light.

21:00.761 --> 21:03.222
I guess I'm just so happy
that you guys found each other.

21:03.222 --> 21:04.890
I know how much Steve needs this.

21:04.890 --> 21:08.185
He could never heal things with Brent.
He wanted that more than anything.

21:09.895 --> 21:11.522
- He did?
- Of course he did.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.983
The Lyft will be downstairs
in three minutes, so...

21:15.526 --> 21:17.653
Guess Steve never told you
that Brent came to him,

21:17.653 --> 21:18.737
begged his forgiveness,

21:18.737 --> 21:20.739
and Steve told his brother
to go fuck himself.

21:20.739 --> 21:22.950
- What?
- I believe that's the exact quote.

21:22.950 --> 21:24.618
- Right, Steve?
- What is she talking about?

21:27.287 --> 21:31.708
He showed up unannounced
at my office after two years--

21:31.708 --> 21:33.544
Because you were refusing
his calls and texts.

21:33.544 --> 21:34.711
He came to your office?

21:34.711 --> 21:37.673
Did Brent ever tell you how many nights
I had to hold my mother who was weeping

21:37.673 --> 21:40.425
because her son was a junkie? Her baby.

21:40.425 --> 21:42.761
My dad didn't comfort her.
He's not capable.

21:42.761 --> 21:45.138
Oh, no, it was me. It was all on me.

21:45.138 --> 21:48.141
Night after night, holding her and
comforting her,

21:48.141 --> 21:50.978
and he thinks he can just
show up years later,

21:50.978 --> 21:54.064
we're gonna hug it out,
and everything's gonna be okay? Fuck him.

21:54.064 --> 21:56.275
- Steve.
- No-- When he came to you,

21:56.275 --> 21:58.527
he was sober for 18 months.

21:58.527 --> 22:00.362
He was doing great.

22:00.362 --> 22:03.073
And then after he saw you,
he was using again two weeks later.

22:03.073 --> 22:04.992
Bullshit! You're putting that on me?

22:04.992 --> 22:09.788
No, it's on him, but you could have been
a little fucking kinder.

22:09.788 --> 22:11.039
I did not do that to him!

22:13.083 --> 22:15.252
I'm gonna head downstairs.
Thank you for dinner.

22:15.252 --> 22:17.880
I am so sorry this did not go
the way that you hoped.

22:17.880 --> 22:19.339
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

22:22.843 --> 22:23.844
Steve.

22:24.761 --> 22:27.389
- I am not responsible for Brent.
- I know you're not.

22:27.389 --> 22:31.476
What he did, he did to himself.
I am not responsible.

22:31.476 --> 22:34.062
I know.

23:50.264 --> 23:53.225
You said to meet you in the gift shop,
and I met you in the gift shop.

23:53.225 --> 23:56.270
You left me for 72 minutes.

23:56.270 --> 23:57.896
Well, I didn't realize it was that long.

23:58.897 --> 23:59.898
It was.

24:02.276 --> 24:04.236
You know,
I'm the whole reason you even met her.

24:05.028 --> 24:06.613
I figured it out. I tracked her down.

24:06.613 --> 24:08.699
I forced you to come to the city
to begin with.

24:08.699 --> 24:10.659
But then the second you see her,
you're all like,

24:10.659 --> 24:12.703
"Hey, hi, Mahira. Hey, hi."

24:12.703 --> 24:13.829
She knew my brother.

24:13.829 --> 24:16.790
She's the only other person in the world
that actually knew my brother.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.836
She's the most important person
in the world to me right now.

24:22.171 --> 24:24.590
I'm sorry, but she is.

24:29.845 --> 24:33.682
Shay, you're important too.

24:35.392 --> 24:37.311
- Shay.
- I'm tired.

24:53.327 --> 24:54.328
Good night, stupid.

25:11.637 --> 25:12.638
Hey.

25:15.349 --> 25:16.225
You okay?

25:16.808 --> 25:18.435
- Tough night?
- I'm fine.

25:19.019 --> 25:20.062
Have I gotten any mail?

25:21.563 --> 25:22.606
Mail?

25:22.606 --> 25:25.275
Yeah, a friend said they sent me a letter.

25:29.821 --> 25:33.825
Not that I can think of,

25:35.327 --> 25:36.328
but I'll ask your uncle.

25:38.872 --> 25:40.082
Maybe that's Shay.

25:45.128 --> 25:46.171
Oh, my God, hi.

25:46.171 --> 25:47.506
Hi.

25:49.925 --> 25:51.802
Sorry, I'm-- I know your aunt.

25:51.802 --> 25:54.388
I know Linda-- No, I'm Linda.
I know Lacey.

25:55.848 --> 25:57.224
I know your aunt from Grief Group.

25:59.935 --> 26:01.270
My boyfriend was on the plane.

26:02.938 --> 26:05.357
Aunt Lacey? Somebody's here.

26:07.860 --> 26:11.071
Nice. Just freaked out the miracle boy.

26:11.572 --> 26:12.865
- Hi.
- How are you?

26:12.865 --> 26:15.534
- Come on in.
- I think I really just freaked him out.

26:17.244 --> 26:19.246
Well, he's okay.

26:19.246 --> 26:20.330
Let's go.

26:21.039 --> 26:22.291
Okay.

26:24.251 --> 26:25.335
This.

26:29.256 --> 26:30.257
Check this out.

26:32.467 --> 26:35.470
- Oh, my God. It's like a transformer.
- It's like a transf-- Yes.

26:35.470 --> 26:37.431
It's perfect for a walk-up apartment.

26:39.183 --> 26:41.977
- Oh, my God.
- I know. Boom.

26:42.477 --> 26:46.398
It's-- You really have, like,
a department store up there.

26:46.398 --> 26:48.609
This is great--
Everything's like brand new.

26:49.234 --> 26:53.655
Well, it's brand new
because I never had a chance to use it.

26:54.781 --> 26:57.910
I tried to have a baby a few times but...

26:59.536 --> 27:00.537
Oh, my God.

27:00.537 --> 27:03.582
And in group, I talked about how
I got pregnant without even trying.

27:03.582 --> 27:06.627
I'm really sorry. That was really
insensitive of me to say that.

27:06.627 --> 27:08.921
- No, it's not. No, it's just--
- I'm sorry.

27:10.005 --> 27:11.006
It's...

27:12.633 --> 27:13.675
old wounds.

27:15.010 --> 27:16.011
It's okay.

27:20.265 --> 27:21.433
Are you still trying?

27:22.559 --> 27:25.270
Not now. No. I have Edward.

27:25.854 --> 27:28.690
I can't-- I don't think--
I can't take all of this stuff.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.859
I really-- I think you should keep it.

27:30.859 --> 27:35.656
And I think you should hold on to it
for when you're ready to use it.

27:37.574 --> 27:38.825
Let me make you a deal.

27:40.035 --> 27:41.036
Take it.

27:41.662 --> 27:45.916
Take all of it, get some baby on it
and check in with me when you're done.

27:45.916 --> 27:50.128
Maybe I'll be ready for it then. Okay?

27:50.796 --> 27:52.256
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.801
This stuff has been sitting here
for way too long.

27:57.010 --> 27:58.262
Thank you.

28:01.431 --> 28:03.642
It's the kindest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

28:17.698 --> 28:19.032
Ms. Washington.

28:27.541 --> 28:29.334
Okay, everybody. Okay, great.

28:30.544 --> 28:32.212
Oh, my goodness. Look at that ring.

28:32.212 --> 28:33.922
- Darnell.
- Hi, lovely to meet you.

28:33.922 --> 28:35.257
I'm Adriana Washington.

28:36.175 --> 28:41.054
So, don't count me out. June 27th.
Look for my name, Adriana Washington.

28:41.054 --> 28:42.598
- Can I count on your vote?
- Yes.

28:42.598 --> 28:44.016
- Are you registered?
- Yes.

28:44.016 --> 28:45.976
All this was in the campaign...

28:45.976 --> 28:48.896
Okay. Yeah, that's really funny.

28:48.896 --> 28:50.355
That's how you get the votes.

28:51.273 --> 28:53.734
I have to go, but lovely meeting you.

29:05.329 --> 29:08.123
You know, the liquor
at these functions is a trap.

29:09.416 --> 29:12.127
They only serve it to see
who they can catch saying the wrong thing.

29:13.420 --> 29:14.463
Club soda for you.

29:15.881 --> 29:16.924
Thank you.

29:17.549 --> 29:18.759
I can handle myself.

29:19.760 --> 29:20.761
I know.

29:23.514 --> 29:24.681
It's crazy, isn't it?

29:25.724 --> 29:26.892
Being here right now.

29:26.892 --> 29:28.101
Life is crazy.

29:28.936 --> 29:30.604
I thought I'd be in grad school right now.

29:31.522 --> 29:33.941
You saved yourself the time and the debt.

29:33.941 --> 29:35.442
And now look at you.

29:40.739 --> 29:42.074
Did you come here alone?

29:42.074 --> 29:44.243
A few of us are here
with Young Professionals.

29:44.743 --> 29:45.827
No date, though.

29:46.662 --> 29:49.957
You? Is your roommate here?

29:49.957 --> 29:52.376
- Don't start.
- Just asking.

29:57.172 --> 29:58.549
He really likes you, Dri.

30:03.679 --> 30:05.138
I really see it for you.

30:05.889 --> 30:07.641
- See what?
- All of it.

30:07.641 --> 30:12.187
Everything you're trying to do politically
and just in life.

30:12.187 --> 30:13.814
I saw when we were back at Penn

30:13.814 --> 30:17.317
and you were holding rallies for the
custodial workers in your beat-up Chucks

30:17.317 --> 30:20.070
- and Student Government t-shirt--
- Don't bring my Chucks into this. No.

30:21.238 --> 30:22.614
And I see it now.

30:22.614 --> 30:25.158
At this fancy-ass fundraiser.

30:26.827 --> 30:28.579
This is in your blood.

30:30.581 --> 30:31.915
You've always had my back.

30:33.667 --> 30:35.627
Even when we weren't
fucking with each other.

30:36.295 --> 30:37.296
Yeah.

30:38.922 --> 30:42.134
I told Mama Rose
that I'd be there for you.

30:42.843 --> 30:46.471
And I want to keep being here,
sharing these moments with you.

30:47.472 --> 30:48.432
You proposing?

30:50.434 --> 30:51.435
No.

30:52.811 --> 30:56.148
But who knows where our lives
go from here?

30:59.276 --> 31:00.986
- Break a leg, Becks.
- Thanks.

31:02.154 --> 31:04.239
Hey, do not break your leg.

31:05.949 --> 31:07.409
Where's Adriana?

31:10.621 --> 31:12.331
I'm not sure she's here, Niece.

31:13.040 --> 31:14.249
But you look great, though.

31:14.249 --> 31:17.461
This Jack fellow better watch his back.
Very scary.

31:20.881 --> 31:21.882
You know,

31:23.133 --> 31:27.095
sometimes people aren't always able to do
the things that they say they will do.

31:28.222 --> 31:31.642
Adriana is very busy right now.
And if she doesn't show up, it's---

31:31.642 --> 31:34.603
- I'm not going on without her here.
- You can't stop the entire show.

31:34.603 --> 31:36.563
It's only four stupid lines.

31:36.563 --> 31:38.649
Then what did you work so hard for then?

31:38.649 --> 31:40.234
We don't run away from responsibilities

31:40.234 --> 31:42.653
just because people don't show up
to watch us carry them out.

31:42.653 --> 31:44.655
No, we do it anyway.

31:45.280 --> 31:48.659
Your mother left the only home
she ever knew to be an actress.

31:48.659 --> 31:52.996
And I know that courage that she possessed
is the same courage inside of you.

31:57.417 --> 31:58.919
We love you, Adriana!

32:03.757 --> 32:05.676
I knew you were gonna show up.

32:10.514 --> 32:11.723
I told you I would.

32:16.687 --> 32:17.938
I hope I'm not too late.

32:18.564 --> 32:19.648
You are right on time.

32:19.648 --> 32:23.068
Excuse me. I don't want to interrupt.

32:23.068 --> 32:26.613
Would it be possible to get a quick selfie
with the future congresswoman?

32:26.613 --> 32:28.073
Well, of course. Come here.

32:29.867 --> 32:31.410
- Perfect.
- Love you.

32:31.410 --> 32:35.038
Loved your grandmother.
I predict you're going places, girl.

32:35.038 --> 32:36.790
Thank you.

32:37.457 --> 32:38.792
Can I get your autograph?

32:39.293 --> 32:41.086
Yes absolutely. Okay.

33:35.516 --> 33:36.517
Can I help you?

33:37.184 --> 33:38.894
Sam. We met at the--

33:38.894 --> 33:42.022
I know who you are. How'd you find me?

33:42.022 --> 33:45.442
There's, like, a thousand photos
of you at work online.

33:45.442 --> 33:47.569
Okay. So, you're Insta-stalking?

33:48.320 --> 33:49.363
No, I--

33:50.447 --> 33:52.032
Technically, yes.

33:52.032 --> 33:54.409
But, I came here

33:54.409 --> 33:58.830
because I really need to close down that
storage unit by the end of the month.

33:58.830 --> 34:03.752
So I just figured I'd let you know,
you know, just on the timing.

34:04.753 --> 34:07.631
Uh-huh. Been here before?

34:08.297 --> 34:09.550
This place?

34:11.426 --> 34:15.514
N-- This is not my type of place.

34:16.223 --> 34:19.141
Give it some time.
These places tend to grow on you.

34:19.726 --> 34:21.395
- Have a seat.
- I can't stay.

34:30.362 --> 34:31.737
So how well did you know Ben?

34:31.737 --> 34:32.822
Not well.

34:33.739 --> 34:36.577
He was a friend of a friend.

34:37.452 --> 34:39.955
But Ben had a certain way about him.

34:39.955 --> 34:43.542
Even when you didn't know him too well,
he made you feel like you were special.

34:45.502 --> 34:48.463
What about you?
You two keep in touch after high school?

34:49.380 --> 34:52.967
No, we lost touch.

34:56.304 --> 34:59.933
But then I saw him three days
before the crash, so--

35:00.601 --> 35:04.938
You got to see him before he died.
That's truly a blessing.

35:06.398 --> 35:07.399
Yeah.

35:15.324 --> 35:17.159
- Well-- I didn't order--
- On the house.

35:45.646 --> 35:50.275
Glass vases and old electronics,
like, washing machines and stuff.

35:50.275 --> 35:52.361
And there was a car.

35:52.361 --> 35:53.570
- No!
- Yeah.

35:53.570 --> 35:54.905
A car.

35:54.905 --> 35:56.532
- Just random stuff.
- Expensive.

35:57.366 --> 35:58.742
Expensive.

35:58.742 --> 36:01.245
- Do you have a hammer or something?
- Yeah, what do you hit it--

36:01.245 --> 36:03.413
Yeah, they had hammers. They had crowbars.

36:03.413 --> 36:07.960
- But I prefer the baseball bat.
- Yes. Baseball bat.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.419
- Hi.
- Welcome back.

36:10.087 --> 36:11.797
John, this is Linda.

36:12.589 --> 36:13.924
- Linda.

36:13.924 --> 36:17.719
- Hi.
- Get you something to eat. Have a seat.

36:17.719 --> 36:20.222
You're probably like,
"What's this rando doing in my house?"

36:22.140 --> 36:23.725
Of course not.

36:23.725 --> 36:25.644
I'm from the Grief Group.

36:27.062 --> 36:28.230
The pregnant one.

36:28.897 --> 36:30.274
- Well, welcome.
- Thank you.

36:30.816 --> 36:33.902
- Hey.
- What's up, dude? You get the pictures?

36:33.902 --> 36:35.195
Yeah, I did. Thanks.

36:35.779 --> 36:37.948
Were you on a trip or something?

36:37.948 --> 36:41.410
Yeah. I went to Colorado.

36:43.161 --> 36:44.746
Near Pagosa Springs.

36:45.330 --> 36:48.041
- I was actually visiting the crash site.
- Anyway--

36:48.041 --> 36:49.710
That must've been intense.

36:49.710 --> 36:52.171
Yeah, it kind of was. I thought--

36:52.838 --> 36:55.591
I don't know. I thought maybe it was
gonna be, like, a field or something.

36:55.591 --> 37:00.596
But I got there and I could feel
all of this,

37:02.055 --> 37:03.056
energy.

37:03.974 --> 37:08.854
And look, I'm not that guy.
I'm not the guy who feels the energy.

37:08.854 --> 37:11.440
You know, I'm sort of the opposite
of that guy really.

37:11.440 --> 37:13.400
But then, I was there,

37:14.818 --> 37:18.322
and I felt them, like, all of them.

37:18.322 --> 37:22.993
And then I was praying for them
and for us, you know, for all of us.

37:22.993 --> 37:27.039
And I think maybe that was
the first time since all this happened

37:27.039 --> 37:28.832
that I haven't felt completely powerless.

37:28.832 --> 37:30.584
I've felt powerless.

37:31.835 --> 37:35.214
- Anyway--
- Why did you go? Why were you there?

37:37.591 --> 37:38.717
I was--

37:39.384 --> 37:41.637
I just thought that--

37:41.637 --> 37:45.015
It's for my nightmares.
I was having nightmares of the crash site.

37:45.015 --> 37:48.310
So he went to take pictures of it
to show it wasn't still on fire.

37:49.728 --> 37:53.565
Wow, that's--
It's really amazing that you did that.

37:55.859 --> 37:56.860
Anyway--

37:57.361 --> 38:00.697
Yeah. Sorry. I didn't mean to
monopolize the conversation.

38:00.697 --> 38:02.824
It's just that Linda was telling us
about her trip to LA.

38:02.824 --> 38:03.909
Yeah, sorry.

38:03.909 --> 38:06.787
No, I was just--
I was just getting to the part

38:06.787 --> 38:10.082
where Gary's parents basically tried
to kidnap me and the baby.

38:10.999 --> 38:14.169
It's not entirely true. I'm exaggerating
a little bit, but not by much.

38:14.169 --> 38:16.338
I had gone to see them and let them know--

38:16.338 --> 38:18.715
Oh, shoot. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I gotta get this.

38:18.715 --> 38:19.842
That's okay.

38:20.968 --> 38:23.929
I was saying earlier I had gone
to the house to meet them.

38:24.555 --> 38:26.932
They had a chef prepare this whole meal.

38:27.516 --> 38:29.726
- Sam?
- Hi, Lacey.

38:31.353 --> 38:32.771
I hope I'm not interrupting.

38:32.771 --> 38:35.732
You said I could call if I ever needed--

38:36.316 --> 38:37.818
Of course. What's going on?

38:37.818 --> 38:41.905
I'm at a bar, talking to this guy.

38:42.698 --> 38:44.741
I think he's flirting with me.

38:47.536 --> 38:48.787
And?

38:49.496 --> 38:50.831
And...

38:51.832 --> 38:53.417
ye-- I might be a little tipsy,

38:53.417 --> 38:55.460
and I'm terrified
that I'm gonna blow up my life.

38:56.920 --> 38:58.589
You won't blow up your life...

39:03.135 --> 39:04.845
unless you want to blow up your life.

39:14.730 --> 39:16.231
My friend from high school,

39:17.316 --> 39:19.943
Ben, the one who died...

39:22.196 --> 39:23.572
he was more than just a friend.

39:29.912 --> 39:34.124
We never actually--
We never really did that much.

39:34.124 --> 39:37.836
<i>It was mostly to just the way
we felt about each other.</i>

39:37.836 --> 39:40.547
You know, every little look
or touch was like...

39:42.549 --> 39:45.135
fire. And then--

39:51.892 --> 39:53.185
And then?

39:54.102 --> 39:56.313
I had a lot of voices to contend with.

39:58.232 --> 40:02.277
And my dad was not and is not the most
enlightened gentleman in the world.

40:02.277 --> 40:04.446
<i>Neither were most of my extended family.
And then--</i>

40:04.446 --> 40:05.531
Right.

40:07.032 --> 40:10.827
I met Sienna and she loved me

40:10.827 --> 40:14.873
and I loved her and you know
It just-- It made it all...

40:16.124 --> 40:17.125
Simpler.

40:18.836 --> 40:19.837
Yeah.

40:22.339 --> 40:23.465
<i>Just...</i>

40:24.758 --> 40:26.593
try not to hurt anybody, okay?

40:29.847 --> 40:30.848
Yeah.

40:35.143 --> 40:36.687
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:36.687 --> 40:38.021
Steve.

40:38.021 --> 40:41.191
I got your jacket dry-cleaned.

40:41.191 --> 40:45.028
- Sorry about yesterday. I was--
- You don't have to be sorry.

40:45.028 --> 40:46.989
You do look a million times better though.

40:46.989 --> 40:49.157
Thanks. I really don't get like that.

40:49.157 --> 40:50.951
It's been a rough week.

40:50.951 --> 40:53.620
We've all been there.
Don't worry. I won't tell anybody.

40:53.620 --> 40:54.705
Thank you.

40:56.665 --> 40:58.667
You got somebody out there or you wanna...

41:04.089 --> 41:05.299
I abandoned Brent.

41:07.926 --> 41:08.927
Sorry?

41:11.930 --> 41:12.931
I--

41:13.599 --> 41:15.642
I abandoned my brother.

41:18.270 --> 41:19.771
He was an addict and...

41:21.899 --> 41:27.321
when he came to me to heal shit,
I rejected him.

41:29.072 --> 41:30.782
Families are complicated.

41:33.202 --> 41:34.494
And I had sex with Amanda.

41:41.043 --> 41:43.504
Why did-- I mean,
I get she's gorgeous but--

41:46.715 --> 41:47.925
Dead brother's fiancée.

41:50.219 --> 41:52.513
I'm fucking fucked up.

41:55.849 --> 41:57.100
Do you like crepes?

41:58.352 --> 42:00.771
I'm gonna make you a crepe. Come in.

42:03.857 --> 42:04.942
You have some place.

42:06.944 --> 42:09.696
Thanks. The bank's about to take it.

42:10.781 --> 42:11.907
Sweet or savory?

42:19.081 --> 42:20.874
Savory, please.

42:27.381 --> 42:29.007
Edward asked me about the letters.

42:30.843 --> 42:32.010
How did he know about them?

42:33.262 --> 42:37.057
I guess some friend said he'd sent him
a letter and he never got it.

42:37.724 --> 42:40.018
Well, I told you
we should've been straight with him.

42:40.018 --> 42:43.939
Thanks, John.
Like I don't feel bad enough about it.

42:43.939 --> 42:45.899
Hey, how long is the pregnant girl
staying here?

42:47.985 --> 42:48.986
Her name is Linda,

42:48.986 --> 42:52.447
and I don't know how long she's staying.
A while.

42:52.447 --> 42:53.991
Well, thanks for the consultation.

42:57.286 --> 42:58.912
Well, maybe if you were here.

43:02.207 --> 43:06.044
Colorado was like, a really profound
experience for me.

43:06.044 --> 43:08.297
I know.
You made that very clear at dinner.

43:10.007 --> 43:12.634
Sorry. I won't talk about it.

43:13.760 --> 43:15.762
- That's not what I'm saying.
- So what are you saying?

43:15.762 --> 43:18.473
What do you want me--
What do you want me to say?

43:18.473 --> 43:20.559
Your idea of helping Edward

43:20.559 --> 43:23.770
was flying off to Colorado
and sending back pictures?

43:23.770 --> 43:26.064
- Yes, that was my idea to help him--
- You went to Colorado

43:26.064 --> 43:27.357
and you sent back pictures.

43:27.357 --> 43:31.486
And then I was the one who was with him
when he got them.

43:31.486 --> 43:34.156
I saw how they impacted him.

43:34.865 --> 43:36.617
He's 12, John.

43:37.993 --> 43:39.453
He is 12.

43:41.413 --> 43:45.459
He lost his mother,
he lost his father and his brother.

43:45.459 --> 43:50.297
Yeah, and I lost Jane
and Bruce and Jordan too.

43:50.297 --> 43:54.635
And I loved them,
and I'm grieving too here.

43:54.635 --> 43:56.678
- I know you are.
- You do, really?

43:56.678 --> 44:00.015
- Of course I do.
- 'Cause I just-- Sh--

44:02.392 --> 44:03.435
What?

44:03.435 --> 44:04.978
There's no space for me here.

44:05.562 --> 44:08.315
I just-- There's no space.

44:08.315 --> 44:10.609
What are you talking about?
There's no space for you where?

44:10.609 --> 44:11.777
Anywhere. Here.

44:12.778 --> 44:15.239
John, that is not true.

44:15.239 --> 44:17.699
I know. Yeah, I know.

44:17.699 --> 44:19.952
I'm gonna-- I don't know. I'm gonna just--

44:19.952 --> 44:21.787
I'm gonna go check on things at work.

44:22.663 --> 44:27.626
Please don't walk out. Oh, my God.
Please don't walk out right now. John!

44:48.188 --> 44:49.189
She's sleeping.

44:52.025 --> 44:53.026
Good night.

44:55.779 --> 44:57.239
Kojo?

44:58.907 --> 45:00.450
Can we talk about this?

45:05.664 --> 45:08.000
I know you're protective of Becks,

45:09.585 --> 45:10.961
and you're a good uncle.

45:12.713 --> 45:14.923
But I showed up today, didn't I?

45:15.757 --> 45:19.511
I want to be there for her too,
while you're still here.

45:29.021 --> 45:31.481
Your friend, Eric,

45:32.649 --> 45:35.235
got this for us a lot quicker
than I expected.

45:39.406 --> 45:41.700
He must really want us out of the country.

45:44.369 --> 45:45.370
When are you leaving?

45:47.456 --> 45:48.457
Soon.

45:50.459 --> 45:51.460
Do you have to?

45:56.256 --> 45:57.257
Yes.

46:02.971 --> 46:05.766
- My family needs me.
- Yeah.

46:05.766 --> 46:10.145
My business needs me and Becks
needs to know where her home would be.

46:10.145 --> 46:11.772
Okay.

46:13.565 --> 46:15.359
I'm very grateful for you.

46:17.402 --> 46:22.533
You've shown us kindness that I never
imagined possible in a place like this.

46:24.535 --> 46:26.620
We will miss you, Adriana.

46:27.746 --> 46:29.206
I'll miss you too.

46:30.707 --> 46:31.917
Both of you.

46:53.939 --> 46:54.940
Hi.

46:56.650 --> 46:57.860
Sorry.

47:00.237 --> 47:01.613
Didn't mean to startle you.

47:02.614 --> 47:04.032
It's fine.

47:04.032 --> 47:05.117
I couldn't sleep.

47:08.579 --> 47:11.665
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm just getting water.

47:18.839 --> 47:22.509
I know this is really pathetic,
but did you notice him?

47:28.724 --> 47:29.725
Did you see him?

47:49.536 --> 47:51.163
Why does everyone keep asking about it?

47:57.419 --> 47:59.838
Because you're the last person
in the entire world

47:59.838 --> 48:01.590
who might have seen him alive.

48:04.009 --> 48:08.055
Any little detail, any tiny, little thing
that you can remember,

48:08.722 --> 48:12.017
the smallest thing whatsoever.
It would mean so much.

48:13.143 --> 48:15.646
I know it's not even fair
for me to ask you,

48:15.646 --> 48:18.273
but you're the miracle boy. You survived.

48:22.611 --> 48:24.446
Sorry.

48:26.114 --> 48:27.533
I'm sorry. That's not fair.

48:38.877 --> 48:42.673
I remember seeing him
in the back of the plane.

48:49.972 --> 48:52.349
We were both just stretching our legs.

48:53.934 --> 48:57.688
<i>We didn't say anything. He just
looked at me and smiled and nodded.</i>

49:02.401 --> 49:04.820
I thought he seemed like
a pretty nice guy.

49:11.535 --> 49:17.207
Jordan was wearing his Adidases,
a yellow t-shirt and his corduroy jacket.

49:18.333 --> 49:21.003
The cab ride took about 40 minutes.

49:21.003 --> 49:24.673
We were late leaving
because he went up to the store.

49:26.049 --> 49:27.718
Maybe he was with you?

49:30.345 --> 49:33.098
Yeah, he was with me.

49:34.808 --> 49:37.853
<i>I flew in the back of the plane
with Jordan and my dad.</i>

49:38.729 --> 49:40.480
<i>And Mom flew in first class.</i>

49:42.399 --> 49:44.276
<i>She brought us the dessert they gave her.</i>

49:52.743 --> 49:54.870
At first, there was just...

49:56.872 --> 49:58.081
<i>a big thump...</i>

50:01.251 --> 50:03.253
<i>we all felt on the left side of the plane.</i>

50:06.924 --> 50:08.425
<i>Like a big smack in the face.</i>

50:14.014 --> 50:15.390
<i>Then it went away for a while.</i>

50:17.309 --> 50:19.269
<i>Then we thought we were going to be okay,</i>

50:20.354 --> 50:23.315
<i>then it came back worse than before.</i>

50:24.107 --> 50:26.860
And then we all--

50:28.028 --> 50:29.238
We all knew.

50:30.781 --> 50:32.366
We just--

50:35.202 --> 50:36.578
We just knew.

50:42.376 --> 50:44.086
I couldn't get to my mom.

50:48.632 --> 50:50.759
No one else was any comfort to me.

50:51.552 --> 50:52.719
Just Jordan.

50:56.598 --> 50:58.934
<i>He told me we'd go to the ocean together.</i>

51:01.979 --> 51:03.438
We'd swim in the Pacific.

51:06.441 --> 51:08.485
<i>And that made me feel okay.</i>

51:11.697 --> 51:13.532
Because I knew no matter what...

51:15.701 --> 51:17.286
he would always be my brother.

51:20.873 --> 51:22.124
And he took care of me.

51:26.003 --> 51:27.087
He was my hero.

51:39.224 --> 51:42.519
Thank you, Eddie. Thank you.
