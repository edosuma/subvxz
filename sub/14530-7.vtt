<i>My name is avery ryan.</i>

00:02.303 --> 00:03.635
<i>I was a victim of cyber crime.</i>

00:03.637 --> 00:06.338
<i>Like you, I posted</i>
<i>on social media,</i>

00:06.340 --> 00:09.208
<i>Checked my bank account</i>
<i>balance online,</i>

00:09.210 --> 00:11.143
<i>Even kept</i>
<i>the confidential files</i>

00:11.145 --> 00:13.379
<i>Of my psychological practice</i>
<i>on my computer.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:18.083
<i>Then I was hacked,</i>
<i>and as a result,</i>

00:18.085 --> 00:20.452
<i>One of my patients</i>
<i>was murdered.</i>

00:20.454 --> 00:23.155
My investigation into her death
<i>led me to the fbi,</i>

00:23.157 --> 00:25.691
<i>Where I joined a team</i>
<i>of cyber experts</i>

00:25.693 --> 00:28.594
<i>To wage a war against</i>
<i>a new breed of criminal</i>

00:28.596 --> 00:31.630

â™ª

01:08.636 --> 01:10.502
Jordan, any news?

01:11.471 --> 01:13.305
What?

01:13.307 --> 01:14.807
Okay, slow down.

01:14.809 --> 01:16.308
Send me the photo.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.310
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna find her.

01:21.614 --> 01:24.483
"I'm sorry, dad.
Don't know what else to do.

01:24.485 --> 01:27.119
It's all too much.
I love you. Good-bye."

01:28.455 --> 01:30.089
Krumitz,
I'm sending you a photo.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.624
I need you to get the gps
coordinates for the metadata.

01:43.203 --> 01:46.705
Man:
<i>Avery, the photo</i>
<i>zoey tan sent to her father</i>

01:46.707 --> 01:49.241
<i>Was taken in rock creek park.</i>

01:49.243 --> 01:51.410
(helicopter blades whirring)

01:54.848 --> 01:57.816
(garbled radio transmission)

02:09.696 --> 02:11.763
(garbled radio transmission)

02:13.533 --> 02:16.401
According to gps coordinates
from the photo that

02:16.403 --> 02:17.669
Zoey sent her father,
it was taken here

02:17.671 --> 02:19.304
In rock creek--
this specific area.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.539
We've got three search units

02:20.541 --> 02:21.874
Covering the four square miles

02:21.876 --> 02:24.443
And another in the zoo
adjacent to the park.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.245
Keep your phone on.
Mmm.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.317
Jordan.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.519
Breathe.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.420
If she's here, we'll find her.

02:35.422 --> 02:37.156
I can't remember
if I told zoey "I love you"

02:37.158 --> 02:38.423
The last time I saw her.

02:40.393 --> 02:42.394
I keep replaying it
through my head. I...

02:42.396 --> 02:43.795
<i>I grabbed my coffee,</i>

02:43.797 --> 02:45.430
<i>I handed her money</i>
<i>for lunch, I...</i>

02:45.432 --> 02:47.699
<i>I think I kissed her</i>
<i>on the forehead. I just...</i>

02:47.701 --> 02:50.335
I just can't remember
what I said.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.537
You're a wonderful father.

02:51.539 --> 02:53.238
I've seen so myself.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.240
Zoey adores you.

02:55.242 --> 02:56.508
She knows you love her.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.510
Well, raising a daughter
on your own, I just...

02:58.512 --> 02:59.745
(dog barking)

02:59.747 --> 03:00.812
Zoey?

03:00.814 --> 03:02.614
Zoey?

03:02.616 --> 03:03.715
Zoey!

03:03.717 --> 03:05.484
Jordan, wait!

03:05.486 --> 03:07.252
(barking)
jordan:
Zoey!

03:07.254 --> 03:09.321
Ryan:
Wait!

03:09.323 --> 03:10.889
(barking)

03:10.891 --> 03:12.591
Jordan:
I'm absolutely sure
that's zoey's phone.

03:12.593 --> 03:15.494
Battery's dead.
It'll take a second.

03:15.496 --> 03:16.595
You think she's
still in the park?

03:16.597 --> 03:19.498
My teams are
continuing the search.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.201
I'll keep you posted.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.504
Do you know zoey's password?

03:25.506 --> 03:27.806
I... I let zoey
have her privacy.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.542
It'll take us a minute
to unlock it.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.945
(phone ringing)

03:32.947 --> 03:34.446
It's zoey.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.647
Baby?
Are you okay?

03:35.649 --> 03:36.648
Where are you?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.450
Zoey?

03:38.452 --> 03:39.785
Zoey.

03:39.787 --> 03:40.886
Hello?

03:46.593 --> 03:49.228
Does zoey have
another cell phone?

03:49.230 --> 03:50.596
Not that I know of.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.298
Well, this phone
wasn't calling you.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.666
Call it back.

03:56.603 --> 03:59.605
(ringing)

03:59.607 --> 04:01.573
What the hell?
Is that possible?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.308
Only if it's
a cyber intrusion.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.943
Zoey's phone was spoofed.

04:06.679 --> 04:08.747
(garbled radio transmission)

04:10.950 --> 04:12.351
Mundo:
Just spoke to
detective garcia.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.585
He's still running point
on the search,

04:13.587 --> 04:14.786
But it's our case now.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.722
Any new evidence of zoey
in the area?

04:16.724 --> 04:18.357
Besides the phone?
Not yet.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.758
They've searched
30% of the park.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.959
We've extended
the perimeter,

04:20.961 --> 04:23.662
But so far, no sign of
a struggle or foul play.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.963
You think she's still alive?

04:24.965 --> 04:26.531
Well, the text was definitive,

04:26.533 --> 04:27.532
But we haven't found a body yet.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.334
Are we, uh...

04:29.336 --> 04:30.636
Ruling out

04:30.638 --> 04:32.404
The father as
a suspect?

04:32.406 --> 04:33.972
Well, I know jordan.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.040
He would never
harm his daughter.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.441
Listen, I know
he's your friend, but...

04:36.443 --> 04:38.577
Elijah, I was
jordan's therapist.

04:38.579 --> 04:40.712
We stayed in contact
after I lost my practice.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.681
He came to me
for grief counseling

04:42.683 --> 04:45.784
When his wife, annette,
passed away.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.719
Zoey is
his life.

04:47.721 --> 04:48.854
There's no doubt in my mind.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.589
Jordan had nothing
to do with this.

04:50.591 --> 04:51.823
All right.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.358
I'm gonna head to their house.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.593
Collect the rest
of zoey's devices.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.727
Oh, elijah...

04:55.729 --> 04:57.829
I know it was
your morning

04:57.831 --> 04:59.598
To take michelle to school.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.599
Thank you for
being here.

05:00.601 --> 05:03.568
To get the time with her,
believe me.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.770
It's important to you.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.738
I wouldn't be anywhere else.

05:08.408 --> 05:09.808
So, uh, thank you
all for coming by.

05:09.810 --> 05:10.942
Uh, there is no news.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.644
Like I said,
zoey is still missing.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.613
I've extended my guidance
counseling hours

05:14.615 --> 05:16.748
For anyone
who might have information

05:16.750 --> 05:17.983
Or just wants to
talk one-on-one

05:17.985 --> 05:20.052
About zoey's
disappearance.

05:20.054 --> 05:21.620
Jordan, please
keep us updated.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.522
And let me know if
there's anything I can do.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.424
Thank you.
Thank you all.
Man:
Call if you need anything.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.992
Woman:
Let us know if
you need anything.

05:33.900 --> 05:34.900
School administrators?

05:34.902 --> 05:36.435
I know they mean well,

05:36.437 --> 05:37.803
But it's like
they're expecting the worst.

05:39.772 --> 05:42.374
I mean, could zoey
have been suicidal

05:42.376 --> 05:43.709
And I just didn't see it?

05:43.711 --> 05:45.877
Did you notice any significant
behavioral changes?

05:45.879 --> 05:48.714
Emotional instability,

05:48.716 --> 05:50.449
Overwhelming sadness,

05:50.451 --> 05:52.084
Anger, hopelessness?
No, no.

05:52.086 --> 05:53.485
There was nothing like that.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.653
I mean, zoey was...

05:54.655 --> 05:57.689
Zoey is a typical
moody teenager.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.491
But she's getting
straight "a"s.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.793
Scored well on her sats.

06:01.795 --> 06:03.729
I thought she was happy.

06:03.731 --> 06:07.766
I mean, I'm her father,
how did I miss this?

06:10.002 --> 06:11.570
Zoey was either really clumsy

06:11.572 --> 06:13.705
Or she took out
some serious aggression

06:13.707 --> 06:15.040
On this poor tablet.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.641
Whoa.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.777
There are no pictures
anywhere in here.

06:18.779 --> 06:19.778
It's like she didn't
have any friends.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.146
That's cute.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.914
You think teenagers
still print out photos.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.616
That's what social
media is for.

06:25.752 --> 06:28.754
What are picture frames for?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.822
Parents. Grandparents.

06:30.824 --> 06:31.823
You know...

06:31.825 --> 06:32.991
Old people.

06:36.496 --> 06:37.729
I would get
mad at you,

06:37.731 --> 06:38.764
But I walked myself
right into that one.

06:38.766 --> 06:41.433
(laughs)

06:42.769 --> 06:45.670
Whoa. Did you see that?

06:45.672 --> 06:47.005
Yeah.
That's weird.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.075
It's like someone
moved the mouse,

06:50.077 --> 06:53.445
First her phone,
now her computer.

06:53.447 --> 06:56.481
Somebody is controlling
zoey's devices.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.452
And we're gonna find you.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.156
What have we got?

07:04.158 --> 07:06.691
You were right about
zoey's phone being spoofed.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.760
But cool thing is
how it was spoofed.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.568
Wait for it...

07:16.570 --> 07:17.903
(phone ringing)

07:19.839 --> 07:21.740
Oh, let me guess:

07:21.742 --> 07:23.442
Nelson is not
the person calling me.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.444
Krumitz:
That's right. I am.

07:25.446 --> 07:26.978
I made
that call

07:26.980 --> 07:28.680
Through a spoofing web site

07:28.682 --> 07:30.682
That anyone with an internet
connection has access to.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.083
There's over a dozen
sites like this.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.452
But the good
news is,

07:33.454 --> 07:35.153
That I had to input
my office number

07:35.155 --> 07:36.755
To make that call just now,

07:36.757 --> 07:38.924
So these sites should have
a record of those inputs.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.091
That was...
That was a good one.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.560
It was.
(laughs)

07:41.562 --> 07:43.795
But, uh...
I think gotcha beat.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.864
I went back and looked
at the metadata

07:45.866 --> 07:47.532
On the photo
that zoey texted her dad.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.768
It was taken at
rock creek park.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.136
Just not this morning.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.204
Four months ago.

07:55.842 --> 07:57.142
<i>Zoey didn't take that photo</i>
<i>with her phone,</i>

07:57.144 --> 07:58.710
<i>She took it</i>
<i>with her digital camera.</i>

07:58.712 --> 07:59.945
But most importantly,

07:59.947 --> 08:01.513
The photo never existed

08:01.515 --> 08:02.747
On zoey's
cell.

08:02.749 --> 08:05.116
How did she send it?
Well, that's
the thing.

08:05.118 --> 08:08.820
I went through 972 photos
on zoey's cell.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.522
Photo wasn't there.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.691
I mean, I checked e-mails...
Nothing.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.893
Then I went to look for the text

08:14.895 --> 08:16.161
That she sent her dad
this morning.

08:16.163 --> 08:20.232
See... There's no way
she sent that text.

08:20.234 --> 08:23.568
I mean, zoey's phone died
on Friday at 11:10 p.M.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.704
It wasn't turned on
until you plugged it in

08:25.706 --> 08:27.839
This morning
around 9:00 a.M.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.275
But the text was
sent to zoey's dad

08:30.277 --> 08:33.278
Two hours before that,
at 7:12 a.M.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.180
Krumitz:
So someone else sent
that text to jordan

08:35.182 --> 08:36.815
Through a
spoofing web site.

08:36.817 --> 08:37.816
Ryan:
That still leaves

08:37.818 --> 08:39.951
One important question.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.953
Where is zoey tan?

08:41.955 --> 08:44.956
Boy, zoey was all the parents
could talk about

08:44.958 --> 08:46.124
At drop-off this morning.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.792
Does your son,
aaron, know her?

08:47.794 --> 08:48.894
He knows her name.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.028
He's seen her
on campus.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.029
Not much else.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.664
She's in the
grade above him.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.899
So where do we
stand on this?

08:53.901 --> 08:55.934
Both the text and call
to jordan's cell

08:55.936 --> 08:57.168
Originated from
a spoofing site.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.703
So all we've got

08:58.705 --> 09:00.906
Is a suicide text
and just...

09:00.908 --> 09:02.641
Hope that zoey's
still alive.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.709
All right.
Keep me posted.

09:05.978 --> 09:08.780
When we collected the devices
from zoey's room,

09:08.782 --> 09:09.948
Someone was watching us through
<i>the camera on her laptop.</i>

09:09.950 --> 09:12.250
Zoey's laptop
is infected

09:12.252 --> 09:13.752
With a malware
that allows the device

09:13.754 --> 09:14.920
To connect with

09:14.922 --> 09:15.987
And control it.
A backdoor trojan.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.122
Exactly.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.857
And I found a foreign
I.P. Address

09:18.859 --> 09:19.858
In her network logs.

09:19.860 --> 09:20.859
We're running it down now.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.762
But I think I know why
she was being spied on.

09:23.764 --> 09:27.098
Of the social media response
to zoey's disappearance.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.801
Orange are tablets
and computers;

09:29.803 --> 09:31.169
Yellow are phones.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.305
The center of the
burst is the device

09:33.307 --> 09:34.973
And person sending out
the information.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.942
These are the screen names
of the people

09:36.944 --> 09:37.976
Posting about zoey.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.277
This heavy
concentration

09:39.279 --> 09:42.013
Of activity
all centers around a website.

09:42.015 --> 09:43.982
This site started
three months ago.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.283
Look at some of the comments.

09:45.285 --> 09:48.954
"zoey, just slit
your wrists already"?

09:48.956 --> 09:50.255
"no one would miss you
if you were dead."

09:50.257 --> 09:51.690
How are kids
this cruel?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.091
Because they're hiding
behind a keyboard.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.126
They think their words
have no consequences.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.895
Press "send" and move on.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.964
â™ª

10:10.076 --> 10:12.043
Ramirez:
<i>I found all this and,</i>

10:12.045 --> 10:14.346
Worst of all, a
video taken of her

10:14.348 --> 10:16.047
Without her
knowledge.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.049
From her camera
on her laptop.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.684
Ryan:
Zoey's being watched.

10:19.686 --> 10:21.219
Recorded.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.021
Terrorized in her own bedroom.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.189
The cyberbully was posting

10:24.191 --> 10:26.124
Zoey's journal entries,
private photos...

10:26.126 --> 10:28.893
Used to be bullying was limited
to the confines of your school.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.395
When you went home,
you could have a break, but...

10:31.364 --> 10:33.031
...Now thanks to the internet,

10:33.033 --> 10:35.233
A bully can attack
anonymously, 24/7.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.168
There's no safe haven.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.004
If I was zoey, I'd run away.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.705
Disappear.

10:40.707 --> 10:41.773
Or commit suicide.

10:48.347 --> 10:54.753
â™ª I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise â™ª

10:56.422 --> 11:02.260
â™ª I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes â™ª

11:02.262 --> 11:06.431
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

11:06.433 --> 11:09.968
â™ª I can see for miles
and miles â™ª

11:09.970 --> 11:14.339
â™ª I can see
for miles and miles â™ª

11:14.341 --> 11:18.009
â™ª and miles...

11:18.011 --> 11:19.077
â™ª oh, yeah.

11:40.332 --> 11:43.234
Why didn't she tell me
she was being bullied?

11:45.204 --> 11:46.337
I could've helped her.

11:46.339 --> 11:48.173
I could've done something.
Jordan,

11:48.175 --> 11:50.809
Only one in ten cyberbullying
victims tell their parents.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.177
There's such a high level

11:52.179 --> 11:54.079
Of shame and fear involved.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.714
When I was a kid,
if you got bullied,

11:55.716 --> 11:57.148
There were physical signs.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.483
Cuts, bruises--
you couldn't hide it.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.718
I should've taken

11:59.720 --> 12:01.219
Her computer out of her room.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.454
Limited her phone access.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.255
She would've figured out
a way to get online.

12:04.257 --> 12:05.857
This is addictive behavior.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.992
Teens stay up all night

12:07.994 --> 12:09.294
Texting, messaging,

12:09.296 --> 12:11.129
Surfing the web.

12:11.131 --> 12:14.999
Is there anyone you can
think of who would want

12:15.001 --> 12:16.301
To lash out at zoey like this?

12:16.303 --> 12:18.236
(huffs)
did she have a fight

12:18.238 --> 12:19.370
With anyone?

12:19.372 --> 12:21.206
A girlfriend? An ex?

12:21.208 --> 12:24.242
No! I feel like I don't know
anything about my own daughter!

12:24.244 --> 12:26.311
Jordan, this is not your fault.

12:26.313 --> 12:29.247
Look, the only person
she had a problem with was me.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.850
What do you mean?

12:31.852 --> 12:32.951
Why?

12:32.953 --> 12:33.985
I started

12:33.987 --> 12:36.254
Seeing someone this year.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.289
And zoey wasn't comfortable
with me dating her.

12:39.859 --> 12:42.894
So I ended the relationship.

12:46.165 --> 12:48.233
Zoey's my world.

12:50.970 --> 12:53.037
What if she doesn't know that?

12:59.812 --> 13:02.147
What if I never get to tell her?

13:08.554 --> 13:11.222
Forensic analysis of zoey's
computer hard drive revealed

13:11.224 --> 13:13.424
Deleted messages from
her friendagenda page, which

13:13.426 --> 13:15.493
I recovered.

13:15.495 --> 13:18.363
I found a long thread
of messages.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.799
With an owen campbell.
Mm-hmm.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.400
Started about five months ago.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.936
So her father
wouldn't find them.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.404
The last message
owen sent her was

13:26.406 --> 13:28.273
The day before
she went missing.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.241
"leave everything behind.
You can start over.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.943
Come be with me."

13:31.945 --> 13:34.112
Get me an address.
Okay.

13:40.519 --> 13:41.953
(grunts)

13:41.955 --> 13:43.154
Where's zoey tan?

13:43.156 --> 13:44.455
I already told the cops

13:44.457 --> 13:46.124
I don't know where she is!

13:46.126 --> 13:47.325
You told her
to come here-- why?

13:47.327 --> 13:50.295
Yeah, I didn't
tell her anything!

13:50.297 --> 13:52.297
I moved to north carolina three
years ago, and I haven't even...

13:52.299 --> 13:54.165
I barely knew her at d.C.!

13:54.167 --> 13:55.567
But you communicated
with her online.

13:55.569 --> 13:57.335
No. No!

13:59.405 --> 14:01.339
Owen!

14:01.341 --> 14:03.842
Let's talk about
your friendagenda page.

14:03.844 --> 14:06.177
You sent this message to zoey,

14:06.179 --> 14:08.580
Asking her to come to north
carolina to be with you.

14:08.582 --> 14:11.282
You want to start
telling the truth?

14:12.451 --> 14:15.019
Whoa, I... I didn't
send that message.

14:15.021 --> 14:17.288
This isn't even my
friendagenda page!

14:17.290 --> 14:19.891
Can I show you?

14:19.893 --> 14:22.427
Thanks.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.433
See?

14:28.435 --> 14:31.236
This is my real page.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.304
Zoey was catfished.

14:33.306 --> 14:36.207
Somebody was pretending
to be you on friendagenda.

14:36.209 --> 14:37.375
Well, how did
they get my photos?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.476
Anybody can go on your page

14:38.478 --> 14:39.510
<i>And steal your photos</i>

14:39.512 --> 14:42.413
<i>To create a fake account.</i>

14:45.317 --> 14:49.020
Zoey thought she was having an
online relationship with you.

14:49.022 --> 14:51.022
Look.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.391
There are hundreds
of messages here.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.130
Oh, yeah, I didn't send any

14:59.132 --> 15:01.432
Of these things.
I told you, you know.

15:01.434 --> 15:02.467
I barely knew zoey.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.902
I would never tell her that...

15:03.904 --> 15:06.471
I loved her, you know?

15:06.473 --> 15:08.606
That's why I was freaking out
when she shows up out of nowhere

15:08.608 --> 15:10.942
At my house this morning.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.478
Wait! You're telling me

15:13.480 --> 15:14.979
That zoey was alive
and in north carolina

15:14.981 --> 15:16.047
This morning?

15:16.049 --> 15:19.284
It was around, uh, 8:00 a.M.
Or something...

15:19.286 --> 15:21.286
Owen, we need you
to tell us exactly

15:21.288 --> 15:23.521
Exactly what happened
when you saw zoey today!

15:25.224 --> 15:26.925
I answered the door.

15:26.927 --> 15:29.127
And then I pushed her away

15:29.129 --> 15:30.595
When she tried to hug me.
It was just

15:30.597 --> 15:32.330
Super awkward 'cause
my actual girlfriend was there.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.398
Mundo:
Was she upset?

15:33.400 --> 15:35.066
Yeah, she seemed
pretty pissed off.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.234
I mean...

15:36.236 --> 15:37.368
She said that I lied to her.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.370
And I was just like the others.

15:39.372 --> 15:42.307
Um... Then I told her to leave.

15:42.309 --> 15:44.342
And... And she did.
Do you have

15:44.344 --> 15:46.244
Any idea where she went?
Was she in a car?

15:46.246 --> 15:47.545
I don't know.
No, I don't think so.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.414
She just walked away.

15:49.416 --> 15:51.649
I just put a bolo out
on zoey to local police.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.552
Hopefully they'll
get eyes on her soon.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.653
So...

15:55.655 --> 15:57.322
Zoey's relationship
with fake owen

15:57.324 --> 15:58.556
Started five months ago.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.658
Two months later,
the bullying started.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.260
It's got to be the
same person, right?

16:02.262 --> 16:03.995
Our target wanted
zoey to suffer

16:03.997 --> 16:05.396
By creating an environment

16:05.398 --> 16:06.531
<i>Where she believed</i>
<i>there was only person</i>

16:06.533 --> 16:08.099
<i>She could turn to and then...</i>

16:08.101 --> 16:09.634
Mundo:
<i>That all came</i>
<i>crashing down when she</i>

16:09.636 --> 16:11.102
Met owen and realized
she'd been catfished.

16:11.104 --> 16:13.404
It's a pretty
elaborate scheme.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.106
Catfishing,

16:15.108 --> 16:16.607
Spoofing, rating,

16:16.609 --> 16:18.476
Cyberbullying--
what's the endgame?

16:18.478 --> 16:21.512
We're looking for someone who
wants to ruin zoey's life.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.349
By isolating her from
friends and family.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.484
Pushing her to the edge.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.553
Well, before she falls over,

16:28.555 --> 16:29.487
We better find her.

16:33.425 --> 16:35.460
Oh, you better believed
I authorized it.

16:35.462 --> 16:36.627
I'll call you later.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.262
Have you located our
target's computer?

16:38.264 --> 16:40.098
Yeah, the node
our cyberbully used

16:40.100 --> 16:41.199
Is somewhere
in zoey's high school.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.233
I'm on my way now.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.469
All right.

16:44.471 --> 16:47.071
So, avery believes

16:47.073 --> 16:49.440
Our cyberbully mastermind

16:49.442 --> 16:51.442
Is part of this whole
social media conversation

16:51.444 --> 16:52.643
Pushing it forward,

16:52.645 --> 16:54.579
Encouraging people to respond.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.614
I can map the degree
of centrality.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.649
Figure out which kids are
central to the network,

16:58.651 --> 17:01.519
Consistently instigating
new conversations.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.589
I don't see how anybody
survives high school these days.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.592
That's why I dropped out.
You were bullied?

17:07.594 --> 17:09.160
Always been different.

17:09.162 --> 17:10.561
My life was a living hell

17:10.563 --> 17:12.196
From first grade on.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.098
When I was 15, I left school.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.134
Became a hacker.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.269
Started with the little stuff,
but then...

17:18.271 --> 17:20.638
Yeah, but then you were
arrested for shutting down

17:20.640 --> 17:23.107
The entire power grid
of new hampshire.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.510
But you can't tell me
you put on the black hat

17:25.512 --> 17:29.447
And orchestrated the largest
scada attack we've seen

17:29.449 --> 17:31.182
Because you were bullied.

17:31.184 --> 17:34.085
No, but being bullied
forced me to escape,

17:34.087 --> 17:36.487
Run away, become a loner.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.556
Because I didn't trust people,
and the computer

17:38.558 --> 17:41.626
Was a safe place
where I had control.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.462
I could be anybody
I wanted to be online.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.498
So... I became a black hat.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.635
So, did you ever

17:50.637 --> 17:53.171
Consider using your hacking
skills to get revenge?

17:53.173 --> 17:54.572
Oh, yeah.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.574
Oh, there's this kid
named trevor.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.177
He is lucky my fbi badge
prevents me

17:59.179 --> 18:01.546
From kicking his ass
all over the internet.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.515
His butt.
I mean kick his butt.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.683
Wh... Hey.

18:05.685 --> 18:06.517
What's going on here?

18:06.519 --> 18:08.252
Push in.

18:12.358 --> 18:15.827
They all seem to be posting
about the same event.

18:15.829 --> 18:17.562
"we don't need to #savezoey,

18:17.564 --> 18:19.630
We need to #runfromzoey"?

18:22.401 --> 18:23.568
When was this video posted?

18:23.570 --> 18:25.303
A few minutes ago.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.704
By zoey.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.807
Loop avery and elijah
in on this!

18:29.809 --> 18:31.642
I've been bullied, tormented,

18:31.644 --> 18:32.877
Tortured by you.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.779
Faceless screen names.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.182
Spreading my humiliation
across the web.

18:38.184 --> 18:41.486
I was told by strangers
to kill myself.

18:41.488 --> 18:43.421
They said the world would be
a better place without me.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.622
And I believed them.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.624
I need to do something to make

18:46.626 --> 18:48.793
This miserable existence
worthwhile.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.695
I know who started

18:50.697 --> 18:53.598
The "kill yourself zoey tan"
web site.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.767
You have 24 hours to confess...

18:56.769 --> 18:58.636
Or you'll be sorry.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.638
That was a threat.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.706
She's a a vigilante
hunting her cyberbully.

19:11.583 --> 19:13.151
Actually, I got
to call you back.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.520
I found a pattern
on the cluster graph.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.622
As soon as a new post appeared
on the cyberbullying page,

19:17.624 --> 19:19.624
There were 12 teens who
consistently sent out

19:19.626 --> 19:21.559
The link or commented
on togglefly,

19:21.561 --> 19:23.895
Which is like twitter.

19:23.897 --> 19:26.898
I'm calling them
"the first responders."

19:40.213 --> 19:43.548
Zoey could certainly believe
one of these is her bully.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.949
We need to I.D.
The person responsible

19:44.951 --> 19:47.418
Before zoey makes good
on her threat and retaliates.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.187
Let me just see that.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.622
Right now, all I have are the
first responder's screen names.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.191
All right, we can
request a subpoena

19:53.193 --> 19:55.626
To get their legal names
from togglefly. But...

20:00.566 --> 20:02.767
What's wrong?

20:02.769 --> 20:05.369
You're certain
about these handles?

20:05.371 --> 20:06.837
Yeah.

20:10.909 --> 20:13.477
This is serious, aaron.

20:13.479 --> 20:15.546
Your togglefly handle
is on a short list

20:15.548 --> 20:16.814
Of potential targets.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.583
You're one of 12 instigators.

20:18.585 --> 20:20.751
And I want to know why
you were cyberbullying zoey.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.454
Everybody else was doing it.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.323
Well, you're not everyone!

20:25.325 --> 20:27.491
I raised you better than this.

20:27.493 --> 20:28.626
Dad, it's not that big a deal.

20:28.628 --> 20:29.694
It's just a joke.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.362
Well....

20:31.364 --> 20:33.564
Do you see me laughing?

20:33.566 --> 20:35.333
Your words hurt this girl.

20:35.335 --> 20:37.301
Words have consequences.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.537
And cyberbullying
happens to be a crime.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.972
If that girl commits suicide,

20:40.974 --> 20:42.573
You could be held responsible.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.508
But, dad, this girl is crazy!

20:44.510 --> 20:46.344
Like, for real crazy.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.679
And-and here, I-I got proof.

20:51.950 --> 20:54.452
She knows how to use a gun!

20:55.988 --> 20:57.888
Where did you get this?

20:57.890 --> 20:59.557
Um...

20:59.559 --> 21:01.392
I don't want to get
anyone in trouble.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.527
You're worried about getting
somebody else in trouble?

21:03.529 --> 21:04.862
Zoey is missing.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.531
Now, she could be suicidal,
she could be homicidal.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.600
Tell me where you got
this video.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.469
(sighs)

21:11.471 --> 21:13.471
Sam posted it.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.939
He took it when his
family went hunting

21:14.941 --> 21:18.476
With zoey and her
dad last year.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.478
Kids are scared
today, dad.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.480
They think she's gonna
go all columbine on us.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.348
Don't suggest
things like that.

21:24.350 --> 21:25.883
This conversation
isn't over, yet.

21:32.924 --> 21:36.294
Man, you missed
some major developments.

21:36.296 --> 21:39.297
Headline is-- zoey's pissed
and is on a rampage.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.765
Now, I'm trying
to find her

21:40.767 --> 21:43.634
Before she does some serious
damage to her cyberbully.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.736
Whatever you got
can't top that.

21:45.738 --> 21:48.506
Au contraire, my vertically
challenged friend.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.641
I found the device that
the cyberbully was using

21:50.643 --> 21:52.043
To torment zoey.

21:54.479 --> 21:56.480
<i>I went to zoey's</i>
<i>high school library.</i>

21:56.482 --> 21:58.082
<i>I had to hook up directly</i>
<i>to the router</i>

21:58.084 --> 22:00.618
<i>To find the exact computer</i>
<i>that the cyberbully used.</i>

22:00.620 --> 22:02.887
<i>Then I searched every device</i>
<i>on the network.</i>

22:06.558 --> 22:08.092
<i>And I found my culprit.</i>

22:08.094 --> 22:10.094
You know,

22:10.096 --> 22:11.762
It's a shame we can't
prosecute computers,

22:11.764 --> 22:13.998
Because this would
be case closed.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.666
Okay, so you're saying
we have the gun,

22:15.668 --> 22:17.668
But we don't have the person
that pulled the trigger?

22:17.670 --> 22:19.036
Correct.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.572
The computer that was spoofing
zoey's devices was

22:21.574 --> 22:23.574
In the high school library,
so anybody with access

22:23.576 --> 22:25.910
To that room could be
the cyberbully.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.411
950 kids go to that school...

22:27.413 --> 22:29.714
Oh, we could be dealing
with more than one target.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.382
Bullies like
to team up.

22:31.384 --> 22:32.550
It's mob mentality.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.719
Would you let
me finish?

22:34.721 --> 22:37.588
The good news is the cyberbully
doesn't know the jig is up.

22:37.590 --> 22:39.590
<i>I swapped this hard drive</i>
<i>tower with a decoy</i>

22:39.592 --> 22:42.393
And installed a wiretap
on the system.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.729
If that cyberbully uses
that computer

22:44.731 --> 22:46.731
To update
the cyberbullying site,

22:46.733 --> 22:48.499
(scoffs)
oh, we'll know.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.401
That's what I'm
talking about.

22:50.403 --> 22:52.603
And that's what
I'm talking about.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.438
Ooh.
Damn.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.639
Ow.
(computer beeps)

22:55.641 --> 22:56.974
Wait, I just
got something.

22:56.976 --> 22:59.810
It's a signal from the tablet
that zoey used.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.849
Nelson just located
the device zoey used

23:04.851 --> 23:06.951
To make her vigilante video.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.953
He's sending us
the coordinates now.
(cell phone chimes)

23:08.955 --> 23:11.055
It's near the intersection
of bedford and 12th.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.623
Then she's less
than half a mile away.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.925
She's on the move.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.529
Turn left here.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.534
The next street, turn right.

23:29.141 --> 23:30.775
She's about a block ahead.

23:33.044 --> 23:35.446
That must be her
in that blue crosstrek.

23:35.448 --> 23:37.415
Two cars in front of us.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.750
This is special agent
avery ryan.

23:39.752 --> 23:42.019
We are in pursuit-- we
need backup from police

23:42.021 --> 23:44.021
And fbi units
in charlotte.

23:44.023 --> 23:46.724
Our suspect is heading north
on ontario drive

23:46.726 --> 23:48.926
In a blue crosstrek.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.795
Pull over, but
do not approach.
(car honks)

23:50.797 --> 23:52.430
Driver might be armed
and dangerous.

23:53.865 --> 23:55.833
Ryan:
<i>She just ran the stop sign.</i>

23:59.738 --> 24:01.439
(car honks)

24:03.809 --> 24:06.811
(cell phone rings)

24:06.813 --> 24:08.679
Simon, go.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.848
Avery, I just got a hit
on jordan tan's credit card.

24:10.850 --> 24:12.783
Zoey bought ammunition
at a store

24:12.785 --> 24:14.785
In north carolina
a half hour ago.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.086
She blew through that stop sign,
and she's got ammo.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.822
She means business.

24:30.502 --> 24:31.836
Ryan:
Zoey!

24:33.505 --> 24:35.573
Let me see
both your hands.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.110
Where's zoey?

24:40.112 --> 24:41.178
Where is she?

24:53.225 --> 24:55.693
Mundo: Keep your hands
where I can see them.

25:02.901 --> 25:05.703
I-I don't know
a zoey tan.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.004
Isabella, is this
your ipad?

25:07.006 --> 25:08.672
Yes.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.007
This is zoey.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.075
Have you seen her?

25:11.077 --> 25:12.076
(gasps gently)

25:12.078 --> 25:13.244
Actually, yes.

25:13.246 --> 25:14.912
She-she found my
ipad earlier today.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.181
I was getting
coffee and lost it.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.149
She returned it to me.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.284
Why?

25:20.286 --> 25:21.552
Something
happen to her?

25:25.223 --> 25:26.557
We've got every
department

25:26.559 --> 25:28.559
Between north carolina
and dc on alert.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.895
We're focusing on
public transit.

25:30.897 --> 25:34.565
But how did zoey get that
woman's ipad in the first place?

25:36.167 --> 25:37.601
Ryan:
<i>Zoey was desperate.</i>

25:37.603 --> 25:39.937
<i>She needed to get online.</i>

25:39.939 --> 25:42.773
<i>She saw an opportunity,</i>
<i>and she took it.</i>

25:57.889 --> 25:59.957
<i>When she was finished</i>
<i>making the video,</i>

25:59.959 --> 26:02.126
<i>She dropped it back off</i>
<i>at the coffee cart.</i>

26:02.128 --> 26:04.128
Excuse me, I found this
on the ground.

26:04.130 --> 26:06.196
I think someone might
have dropped it.

26:06.198 --> 26:07.331
You found it?!

26:07.333 --> 26:09.199
Thank you. Thank you.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.234
Oh.

26:13.038 --> 26:15.639
Yeah, but, I mean,
why not just dump it?

26:15.641 --> 26:18.242
Why bring it back and return
to the scene of the crime?

26:18.244 --> 26:22.913
It was worth the risk of getting
caught to clear her conscience.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.214
She's a good kid.

26:24.216 --> 26:25.916
Yeah.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.919
I don't know, I just wish
aaron had the same conscience.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.622
You know, he had almost no
remorse for what he did to zoey.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.123
If I have to hear

26:33.125 --> 26:35.793
"everyone else is doing
it" just one more time...

26:35.795 --> 26:37.795
Aaron wanted to be a part
of the social norm.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.263
He felt powerful,
in control.

26:39.265 --> 26:41.265
He got caught up
in a cyber-mob.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.634
Which led to a diffusion
of responsibility.

26:43.636 --> 26:45.636
No, he didn't
just join in.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.338
Avery, he helped
lead the charge.

26:47.340 --> 26:50.207
He'll be less likely to engage
in bullying behavior

26:50.209 --> 26:51.342
Because you know.

26:51.344 --> 26:53.177
So open up
the conversation with him.

26:53.179 --> 26:55.179
Tell aaron
that you expect

26:55.181 --> 26:57.014
And you trust him
to make better decisions.

26:57.016 --> 26:59.617
And if he doesn't,
monitor him.

27:00.352 --> 27:01.719
Yeah.

27:01.721 --> 27:03.020
All right, all right.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.321
Session's over.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.290
So let's get back
into zoey's head.

27:06.292 --> 27:09.360
I analyzed her patterns of life
looking for a tipping point.

27:09.362 --> 27:12.296
Looking for some event that
would reveal her cyberbully.

27:12.298 --> 27:14.798
But I couldn't find
any fights with any friends,

27:14.800 --> 27:16.133
No bad breakups.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.135
Before the
cyberbullying,

27:18.137 --> 27:20.804
Zoey led a very ordinary life
for a 17 year old.

27:20.806 --> 27:23.140
The only thing I'm sure of
is that she's unsure.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.875
About what
she'll do next?

27:24.877 --> 27:27.378
About who
her cyberbully is.

27:27.380 --> 27:30.347
If she knew, why wouldn't she
say it in her video threat?

27:30.349 --> 27:34.885
I know who started the "kill
yourself, zoey tan" web site.

27:34.887 --> 27:38.222
You have 24 hours to confess,

27:38.224 --> 27:39.923
Or you'll be sorry.

27:39.925 --> 27:42.826
Yeah, she's on the
same search we are.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.828
Only, zoey's experiencing
overwhelming humiliation

27:44.830 --> 27:46.163
And anger.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.731
Which could push her
to follow through

27:47.733 --> 27:49.066
On her threats
of revenge.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.901
Well, we need to find
her before that happens.

27:50.903 --> 27:52.369
I'll send units over
to flintwood high.

27:52.371 --> 27:55.305
There is not gonna be a
school shooting on my watch.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.441
(tablet chimes)

27:57.443 --> 27:59.343
Zoey posted again.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.879
Another video.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.383
"you should think twice
about cyberbullying.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.752
Especially if your dad
works for the fbi."

28:10.055 --> 28:12.056
Sifter: This was done
in my son's bedroom.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.857
From his computer.

28:15.160 --> 28:18.062
Zoey has rated
my son's computer.

28:18.064 --> 28:20.397
Rating software's
easy to download.

28:20.399 --> 28:22.399
She's following through
on her threats.

28:22.401 --> 28:23.767
Doing psychological
damage to aaron.

28:23.769 --> 28:25.169
Right.

28:25.171 --> 28:27.404
She just got revenge
with a cyber-bomb.

28:27.406 --> 28:30.107
Yeah, what if psychological
revenge isn't enough?

28:30.109 --> 28:33.010
She decides to get physical
damage in the real world?

28:33.012 --> 28:35.079
She's starting with aaron,
someone else will be next--

28:35.081 --> 28:37.281
Until she finds out
who her bully is.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.416
I'm gonna have nelson
pick up his computer.

28:39.418 --> 28:42.419
Zoey must have stolen
another device to rat aaron.

28:42.421 --> 28:43.420
We're gonna find her.

28:43.422 --> 28:44.488
All right.

29:04.809 --> 29:07.511
â™ª

29:27.499 --> 29:30.901
We need to figure out
who the cyberbully mastermind is

29:30.903 --> 29:32.236
Before zoey does.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.471
I got all the legal names
of the first responders.

29:34.473 --> 29:38.408
Three of them don't go
to zoey's high school.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.077
Leaving us with nine
possible targets.

29:40.079 --> 29:44.081
Looking at the time stamps
of the cyberbullying page,

29:44.083 --> 29:48.252
They all seem to appear
between 12:00 to 1:00 p.M.

29:48.254 --> 29:50.387
Hmm.

29:50.389 --> 29:52.089
Is there any way
to determine

29:52.091 --> 29:54.057
Which students were in the
library at that time?

29:54.059 --> 29:56.059
We sure can-- I have
all the school schedules.

29:56.061 --> 29:58.061
Eight out of the nine
students didn't have access

29:58.063 --> 30:00.397
To the library between
12:00 to 1:00 p.M.

30:00.399 --> 30:03.367
Since it was occupied
by the yearbook staff.

30:05.170 --> 30:07.171
Leaving us
with jennifer mayfield.

30:07.173 --> 30:10.541
I honestly don't know
who started the page.

30:10.543 --> 30:12.876
I feel so awful
for zoey.

30:12.878 --> 30:14.812
We've been friends
since preschool.

30:14.814 --> 30:17.147
I don't think I've ever
called one of my friends

30:17.149 --> 30:19.149
A "heinous bitch"
or told them

30:19.151 --> 30:21.852
I wish that they would die
a slow and painful death.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.422
Well, some friends
deserve it.

30:36.301 --> 30:38.468
Zoey betrayed you, didn't she?

30:40.572 --> 30:43.106
One of the first posts
on that page was a chat

30:43.108 --> 30:44.441
Between zoey
and another girl.

30:44.443 --> 30:45.576
About me.

30:45.578 --> 30:48.312
Zoey revealed
some stuff I told her.

30:48.314 --> 30:50.314
Private stuff.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.449
So, yeah, I was pissed.

30:52.451 --> 30:55.452
After the page started.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.554
Before that, we were cool.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.223
(cell phone plays music)

31:06.865 --> 31:08.532
Oh, my god.

31:08.534 --> 31:10.534
I can't believe
she did this.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.236
Zoey posted
a photo of me

31:12.238 --> 31:14.104
Undressing in my room
on togglefly.

31:14.106 --> 31:18.175
That photo was taken on the
camera of your computer.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.043
It doesn't feel
great to be

31:20.045 --> 31:21.411
On the other side of
cyberbullying, does it?

31:21.413 --> 31:23.113
I didn't start the page,
I just joined in.

31:23.115 --> 31:26.450
Jennifer, this
is important.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.886
Do you have any
idea where zoey is?

31:28.888 --> 31:30.220
No.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.288
(knocking on glass)

31:32.590 --> 31:35.525
You can go.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.661
Think I have a lead
on where zoey might be.

31:37.663 --> 31:39.263
I went old-school--
traced her movements

31:39.265 --> 31:41.932
On the ipad, based on the
ridge detail left on the screen.

31:41.934 --> 31:43.333
A fingerprint smudge path...

31:43.335 --> 31:45.369
<i>That she left behind</i>
<i>when she uploaded the video.</i>

31:45.371 --> 31:46.670
Mundo:
<i>Then I found a rogue print,</i>

31:46.672 --> 31:48.272
<i>Which I just got</i>
<i>confirmation...</i>

31:48.274 --> 31:50.307
Is zoey's.

31:54.412 --> 31:57.547
Zoey searched for directions
to the city of chesapeake bay.

31:57.549 --> 32:00.050
Mm-hmm. Only problem is,
there's no address.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.385
I don't need an address.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.186
I know exactly
where she's going.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.363
Jordan: <i>When she first</i>
<i>disappeared,</i>

32:13.365 --> 32:14.665
<i>I called the cops</i>
<i>in chesapeake bay.</i>

32:14.667 --> 32:15.699
They searched the cabin.

32:15.701 --> 32:18.302
We haven't been to the cabin

32:18.304 --> 32:19.503
Since annette passed away.

32:19.505 --> 32:24.641
We're gonna find zoey.

32:24.643 --> 32:29.179
There's a backdoor trojan
on jennifer's computer.

32:29.181 --> 32:32.649
Found the same foreign ip
address on both devices.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.085
That links to the computer
from the library,

32:35.087 --> 32:36.153
That we confiscated.

32:36.155 --> 32:37.187
I just traced the origin

32:37.189 --> 32:40.324
They also came from
the computer in the library.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.692
I've got a wiretap
on that computer.

32:41.694 --> 32:43.393
I would've seen
the transmissions.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.062
Other than kids
checking their e-mail

32:45.064 --> 32:47.130
And trying to look up
blocked porn sites,

32:47.132 --> 32:49.266
There hasn't been
a lot of activity there.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.001
Zoey's not the one
sending out these posts.

32:51.003 --> 32:53.570
The cyberbully rated
those kids' computers

32:53.572 --> 32:55.405
And hijacked zoey's
togglefly account.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.040
So our target
is doing all of this

32:57.042 --> 32:59.676
Without physical access to that
computer in the library.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.411
And they have to be connected
to the high school's network

33:01.413 --> 33:02.546
In order to spoof the computer.

33:02.548 --> 33:07.985
So the device used to spoof that
computer is at the high school?

33:07.987 --> 33:09.286
That means
our cyberbully is there, too.

33:09.288 --> 33:10.687
Come on.

33:15.626 --> 33:18.328
Ramirez: All right, let's search
the network for the device.

33:18.330 --> 33:19.463
Nelson: If the cyberbully's
computer's on line,

33:19.465 --> 33:20.597
We'll get its unique I.D.

33:20.599 --> 33:22.666
Ramirez:
Yeah, the mac address.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.601
I used to hide out in my
school's library during lunch.

33:24.603 --> 33:27.738
The librarian was
practically my best friend.

33:27.740 --> 33:29.239
So where do you
hide out now?

33:30.641 --> 33:32.509
(quiet laugh)

33:32.511 --> 33:35.512
The cyberbully
lured zoey to owen.

33:35.514 --> 33:36.680
Dropped her phone in the park.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.115
Spoofed her phone.

33:38.117 --> 33:40.150
All so they could send you
that suicide text.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.418
And the phone call.

33:44.655 --> 33:46.790
Zoey! Zoey...

33:46.792 --> 33:49.126
We've been
thinking about this all wrong.

33:49.128 --> 33:50.794
It isn't about zoey.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.496
It's about you.

33:52.498 --> 33:53.630
You were the intended victim.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.766
Me? I don't understand.

33:55.768 --> 33:58.535
You're saying that someone's
bullying zoey because of me?

33:58.537 --> 34:00.370
That doesn't make sense.

34:00.372 --> 34:01.471
What are you doing?

34:05.410 --> 34:06.710
I need to look at your phone.

34:09.247 --> 34:10.714
We found the mac address.

34:12.550 --> 34:13.750
That's it.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.786
That's the ip address
of the computer

34:15.788 --> 34:18.722
Linked to this computer,
that spoofed zoey's devices,

34:18.724 --> 34:20.624
And it's definitely
here in this school.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.495
This will tell us
when we're getting closer

34:25.497 --> 34:26.663
To the target's device.

34:26.665 --> 34:28.598
It's 76% now.

34:32.770 --> 34:33.804
Okay, 88%.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.843
We just hit 97%.

34:42.146 --> 34:43.613
Any of them could
be connected

34:43.615 --> 34:45.482
To the network
through the wi-fi.
(phone ringing)

34:46.417 --> 34:47.751
Avery?
Did you find zoey?

34:47.753 --> 34:49.152
Elijah, we had it
all wrong.

34:49.154 --> 34:50.654
You're not looking
for a student.

34:50.656 --> 34:52.389
I should've known.

34:52.391 --> 34:53.757
It's always the jilted lover.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.126
We're on it.

35:02.533 --> 35:03.767
Hundred percent.

35:05.369 --> 35:07.804
And now we have our proof.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.807
All right, time for me
to get a little guidance.

35:10.809 --> 35:13.110
(school bell ringing)

35:13.112 --> 35:14.711
Arianna peterson?

35:14.713 --> 35:15.712
Yes.

35:15.714 --> 35:17.647
Agent mundo.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.716
I'd like to ask you a few
questions about zoey tan.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.284
Of course. Yes.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.587
Um, anything I can do to help.

35:23.589 --> 35:26.790
Come on in.
I'm sorry about this mess.

35:27.859 --> 35:29.726
I'm also
yearbook advisor.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.495
I'm doing double duty
around here.

35:32.563 --> 35:34.498
So...

35:34.500 --> 35:36.233
Should we be worried
about our safety,

35:36.235 --> 35:38.502
Since zoey
is still out there?

35:38.504 --> 35:40.170
Usually victims
of cyberbullying

35:40.172 --> 35:41.771
Kill themselves,
not other people.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.507
Oh, god.

35:46.777 --> 35:48.478
You're her guidance counselor.
You didn't know that?

35:48.480 --> 35:50.914
Well, I heard rumors.

35:50.916 --> 35:53.917
But I stay off of
social media.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.486
Really?

35:58.256 --> 35:59.656
'cause you updated
zoey's cyberbullying page,

35:59.658 --> 36:02.192
20 minutes ago,
from your computer.

36:11.702 --> 36:12.869
Like a criminal
who gloves up

36:12.871 --> 36:14.838
And files a serial
number off a gun,

36:14.840 --> 36:17.574
You took every cyber
precaution to hide yourself.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.809
But, like most criminals,
you made a mistake--

36:19.811 --> 36:22.946
Using a burner phone
to text zoey's father.

36:22.948 --> 36:25.849
We traced the serial number from
that phone right back to you.

36:25.851 --> 36:29.719
You can't prove
any of what you're saying.

36:29.721 --> 36:32.355
Even I know that burner
phones are untraceable.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.324
But what you don't know
is that the first time

36:34.326 --> 36:35.959
You connect a phone
with a computer,

36:35.961 --> 36:37.494
It logs that activity.

36:39.430 --> 36:42.832
Mundo: <i>Leaves a digital trace.</i>
<i>A cyber fingerprint.</i>

36:42.834 --> 36:44.467
<i>You plugged your burner phone</i>
<i>into this computer</i>

36:44.469 --> 36:46.236
<i>Minutes before texting</i>
<i>zoey's father.</i>

36:47.738 --> 36:49.906
We know he ended his
relationship with you.

36:51.275 --> 36:53.910
What are you talking about?

36:53.912 --> 36:56.713
Must've really
pissed you off.

36:56.715 --> 37:00.850
'cause you decided
to torture jordan.

37:00.852 --> 37:03.820
Zoey? Zoey...
When he was in rock creek park,

37:03.822 --> 37:05.755
<i>Just to, what...</i>
<i>Hear the fear in his voice?</i>

37:07.358 --> 37:11.962
You have no idea
what he did to me.

37:11.964 --> 37:14.331
He dumped me...

37:14.333 --> 37:15.765
Like a piece of trash.

37:17.501 --> 37:18.969
All because of <i>her.</i>

37:18.971 --> 37:21.438
He chose <i>her.</i>

37:21.440 --> 37:23.006
She's his daughter--
what did you expect?

37:26.844 --> 37:29.546
A few weeks after
you and jordan broke up,

37:29.548 --> 37:31.481
<i>You started catfishing zoey,</i>

37:31.483 --> 37:34.284
<i>Drawing her into a fake online</i>
<i>relationship with owen.</i>

37:34.286 --> 37:35.885
Because, if she was happy
with owen,

37:35.887 --> 37:38.521
I thought she'd let her dad
be happy, too,

37:38.523 --> 37:40.724
And she'd be okay with us
getting back together.

37:41.926 --> 37:43.660
Mundo:
<i>But when none of that worked,</i>

37:43.662 --> 37:44.828
<i>Then you rated zoey's computer</i>

37:44.830 --> 37:46.029
<i>And started</i>
<i>a cyberbullying page,</i>

37:46.031 --> 37:47.297
<i>To torment zoey.</i>

37:48.899 --> 37:51.868
I wanted jordan to suffer,
just like I did.

37:51.870 --> 37:53.336
But why go after zoey?

37:53.338 --> 37:56.473
Why do that to
a 17-year-old girl?

37:56.475 --> 37:59.376
Because the best way
to hurt a father

37:59.378 --> 38:01.444
Is to hurt his child.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.882
Arianna peterson,
you're under arrest

38:05.884 --> 38:07.984
For cyber fraud
and aggravated stalking.

38:10.288 --> 38:12.656
(mobile device cameras clicking)

38:14.992 --> 38:17.961
Worst guidance
counselor ever.

38:25.336 --> 38:26.469
(gunshot)

38:26.471 --> 38:28.338
Was that a gunshot?

38:32.009 --> 38:33.977
I keep that car covered
and the key hidden!

38:33.979 --> 38:35.078
Zoey must be here!

38:35.746 --> 38:38.581
Zoey! Zoey!

38:38.583 --> 38:39.649
Zoey!

38:41.319 --> 38:42.952
Oh, my god! Oh...

38:42.954 --> 38:44.521
She's bleeding!

38:44.523 --> 38:46.690
This is agent avery ryan,
at 527 oakwood road.

38:46.692 --> 38:47.991
Right here, sweetheart.
Have a gunshot victim.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.527
(weakly):
I wasn't going to...

38:50.529 --> 38:52.329
I wasn't...
I wasn't going to...

38:52.331 --> 38:53.330
That's okay.

38:53.332 --> 38:55.098
It's okay.
I wasn't gonna...

38:55.100 --> 38:56.933
Avery, she's losing
consciousness.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.903
Take off your jacket,
apply pressure to the wound.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.644
How did this happen?

39:37.541 --> 39:39.075
(rattling, clanking)

39:43.047 --> 39:46.015
Jordan, did you keep
rifles in the cabin?

39:46.017 --> 39:48.151
She was taking the rifles?

39:48.153 --> 39:49.919
Why, zoey?

39:49.921 --> 39:51.554
Why would you do that?

39:51.556 --> 39:53.056
She was having second thoughts.

40:03.801 --> 40:06.102
(tires screeching)

40:11.776 --> 40:14.778
(crying quietly)

40:19.150 --> 40:20.850
(crying)

40:21.786 --> 40:23.453
(banging on trunk lid)

40:27.792 --> 40:29.793
(sobs, bangs on trunk lid)

40:32.463 --> 40:34.197
(gasps)

40:35.132 --> 40:36.933
She accidentally
shot herself

40:36.935 --> 40:39.636
When she was trying to get
the guns out of the trunk.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.104
That's what she was
trying to tell you.

40:41.106 --> 40:42.972
She wasn't going
to go through with it.

40:42.974 --> 40:45.175
(sirens approaching)

40:45.177 --> 40:49.045
(vehicles stopping nearby,
doors opening and shutting)

40:49.047 --> 40:50.647
She's gonna
make it, jordan.

40:50.649 --> 40:53.716
Yeah.
Zoey's gonna be okay.

40:53.718 --> 40:55.185
(sirens wailing)

41:07.498 --> 41:10.133
I'm gonna be leaving
social media for awhile,

41:10.135 --> 41:13.770
So this will be the last video
I'm posting.

41:15.172 --> 41:19.042
For those of you who care,
surgery went well.

41:19.044 --> 41:20.810
(over tablet):
Besides a gnarly scar

41:20.812 --> 41:22.612
And a couple months on crutches,

41:22.614 --> 41:25.715
Doctors say that
I'm going to be fine.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.116
Better than fine.

41:28.819 --> 41:31.254
To everyone who cyberbullied me,

41:31.256 --> 41:34.924
Know that your words
mean something.

41:34.926 --> 41:37.627
That cruel comment that you type
without second thought

41:37.629 --> 41:39.829
Could destroy someone's life.

41:41.165 --> 41:42.932
Your words are weapons.

41:44.134 --> 41:45.935
Be careful how you use them.

41:53.143 --> 41:54.811
(sighs)
