00:08.770 --> 00:11.558
Look, dad's gone now.
We have to carry out his legacy.

00:11.732 --> 00:16.064
And that means hunting down as many
evil sons of bitches as we possibly can.

00:19.994 --> 00:21.239
Whoops.

01:04.430 --> 01:05.712
Sam, look out!

01:05.891 --> 01:07.968
- Unh!
- No!

01:09.604 --> 01:11.644
Sam!

01:14.320 --> 01:16.194
You're offering your soul?

01:16.364 --> 01:20.113
- All you gotta do is bring Sam back.
- I'll give you one year. One year only.

01:20.285 --> 01:23.205
If you try and weasel your way out
then the deal is off.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.492
How certain are you...

01:28.213 --> 01:31.750
...that what you brought back,
is 100 percent pure Sam?

01:39.103 --> 01:40.219
What just happened?

01:40.397 --> 01:43.316
That's a Devil's Gate,
a damn door to hell.

01:45.570 --> 01:48.823
Hope to hell you boys are ready
because the war has just begun.

04:53.873 --> 04:55.249
<i>Hello?
- Hey, Sam.</i>

04:55.417 --> 04:57.042
<i>- Hey, Bobby.
- What are you doing?</i>

04:57.211 --> 05:00.629
- You know, same old, same old.
- You buried in that book again?

05:01.259 --> 05:04.463
<i>Sam, you wanna break Dean free
of that demon deal...</i>

05:04.638 --> 05:06.798
...you ain't gonna find the answer
in no book.

05:06.975 --> 05:10.392
- Then where, Bobby?
- Kid, I wish I knew.

05:11.022 --> 05:13.395
<i>- So where's your brother?
Ha-ha-ha!</i>

05:13.984 --> 05:15.610
- Polling the electorate.
- What?

05:15.779 --> 05:17.902
<i>- Never mind.
- You boys better pack it up.</i>

05:18.074 --> 05:20.482
I think I finally found something.

05:22.704 --> 05:24.330
Dean?

05:26.001 --> 05:27.579
Dean, you conscious?

05:27.753 --> 05:29.462
Bobby called
and he thinks that maybe we...

05:31.008 --> 05:32.503
- Oh, God.
Woo-hoo!

05:38.602 --> 05:40.061
Let me see your knife.

05:40.229 --> 05:42.686
- What for?
- So I can gouge my eyes out.

05:42.858 --> 05:46.026
Ha, ha.
It's a beautiful, natural act, Sam.

05:46.196 --> 05:48.734
It's a part of you
I never wanted to see, Dean.

05:50.202 --> 05:53.536
I appreciate you giving me quality time
with the Doublemint Twins.

05:53.706 --> 05:55.533
Yeah, no problem.

05:56.293 --> 05:57.456
Really?

05:58.797 --> 06:02.249
I gotta say, I was expecting a weary sigh
or an eye roll. Something.

06:02.426 --> 06:05.097
No, not at all.
You deserve to have a little fun.

06:05.263 --> 06:08.302
Well, I'm in violent agreement
with you there. Ha, ha.

06:08.477 --> 06:10.019
- What's Bobby got?
- Not much.

06:10.187 --> 06:12.809
Crop failure and a cicada swarm
outside of Lincoln, Nebraska.

06:12.983 --> 06:16.104
- Now, it could be demonic omens...
- Or a bad crop and bug problem.

06:16.279 --> 06:18.154
- But it's our only lead.
- Any freaky deaths?

06:18.324 --> 06:20.531
- Nothing Bobby could find. Not yet.
- It's weird, man.

06:20.702 --> 06:24.701
The night the gate opened, storm clouds
were sighted over how many cities?

06:24.875 --> 06:25.954
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen.

06:26.126 --> 06:30.457
<i>You'd think it'd be Apocalypse Now.
It's been five days and bupkes.</i>

06:32.593 --> 06:34.670
- What are the demons waiting for?
- Beats me.

06:34.847 --> 06:36.222
It's driving me crazy.

06:36.390 --> 06:39.309
- Lf it's gonna be war, I wish it'd start.
- I don't know, man.

06:39.477 --> 06:41.935
Careful what you wish for.

06:56.668 --> 06:58.328
Hear those cicadas?

06:58.505 --> 07:00.296
Well, that can't be a good sign.

07:00.465 --> 07:02.506
No. No, it can't.

07:06.181 --> 07:09.884
So we're eating bacon cheeseburgers
for breakfast, are we?

07:10.062 --> 07:15.568
Well, sold my soul. Got a year to live.
I ain't sweating the cholesterol.

07:15.736 --> 07:18.525
So, Bobby, what do you think?
We got a biblical plague here or what?

07:18.699 --> 07:22.912
Well, let's find out.
Looks like the swarm's ground zero.

07:24.289 --> 07:26.414
Candygram!

07:42.566 --> 07:43.846
That's awful.

07:44.026 --> 07:47.478
- Ugh. That so can't be a good sign.
- No.

08:19.825 --> 08:21.534
You hear that?

08:35.304 --> 08:38.092
<i>- It's supposed to be my birthday party.
Oh, my God.</i>

08:48.865 --> 08:51.784
<i>Grandma is
making out the invitation list.</i>

08:52.663 --> 08:54.241
<i>Sue Ellen is gonna hire...</i>

08:54.415 --> 08:56.953
- Bobby, what the hell happened here?
- I don't know.

08:57.126 --> 08:59.915
<i>- And J.R. Is gonna use this...
- Check for sulphur.</i>

09:00.090 --> 09:05.168
<i>- Big deals.
And now you're gonna buy my clothes.</i>

09:05.346 --> 09:07.719
<i>I hate this family!</i>

10:00.507 --> 10:02.749
Isaac? Tamara?

10:04.762 --> 10:06.755
Bobby,
what the hell are you doing here?

10:06.931 --> 10:09.602
- I could ask the same.
- How are you, Bobby?

10:09.769 --> 10:12.771
Hello? Bleeding here. Huh.

10:14.943 --> 10:17.435
So, Jenny, is it?
That is a beautiful name.

10:17.614 --> 10:20.105
That's my sister's name. Yeah.

10:20.284 --> 10:22.443
- Honey.
She sounds like you.

10:22.620 --> 10:24.079
Where's the Palo Santo?

10:24.247 --> 10:25.624
Well, where'd you leave it?

10:25.792 --> 10:28.663
I don't know, dear,
that's why I'm asking.

10:28.837 --> 10:32.539
- Palo Santo?
- It's holy wood. From Peru.

10:32.717 --> 10:36.302
It's toxic to demons, like holy water.

10:36.473 --> 10:40.092
Keeps the bastards nailed down
while you're exorcising them.

10:40.269 --> 10:41.515
Thank you, dear.

10:41.688 --> 10:44.394
You'd lose your head
if it wasn't for me.

10:45.736 --> 10:47.444
So how long you two been married?

10:47.863 --> 10:49.322
Eight years this past June.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.906
- The family that slays together...
Right, I'm with you there.

10:54.081 --> 10:55.279
So how'd you get started?

11:01.716 --> 11:04.884
Oh, you're not... I'm sorry. It's not...

11:05.054 --> 11:08.139
- It's none of my business.
- No, no, it's... It's all right.

11:08.308 --> 11:12.438
Well, Jenny, if you, uh, look as pretty
as you sound...

11:12.606 --> 11:15.608
...then I'd love to have an appletini.

11:16.403 --> 11:18.147
Yeah. Call you.

11:18.323 --> 11:20.232
- That was the coroner's tech.
And?

11:20.409 --> 11:23.031
Get this.
That whole family, cause of death:

11:23.204 --> 11:24.948
Dehydration and starvation.

11:25.123 --> 11:28.126
No signs of restraint. No violence.
They just sat down and never got up.

11:28.295 --> 11:30.502
But there was a fully-stocked kitchen
just yards away.

11:30.673 --> 11:32.547
Right. What is this, a demon attack?

11:32.717 --> 11:35.969
If it is, it's not like anything I ever saw
and I've seen plenty.

11:36.139 --> 11:37.883
Well, what now? What should we do?

11:38.058 --> 11:40.347
- Uh, we're not gonna do anything.
- What do you mean?

11:40.520 --> 11:41.979
You guys seem nice enough...

11:42.147 --> 11:45.233
<i>...but this ain't Scooby-Doo
and we don't play well with others.</i>

11:45.402 --> 11:47.728
I think we'd cover more ground
if we all worked together.

11:47.905 --> 11:50.231
No offense. But we're not teaming
with the damned fools...

11:50.408 --> 11:53.530
...who let the Devil's Gate get opened
in the first place.

11:53.705 --> 11:54.950
- No offense?
- Isaac.

11:55.123 --> 11:58.493
- Like you've never made a mistake.
- Oh, yeah. Locked my keys in the car.

11:58.670 --> 12:00.295
Turned my laundry pink.

12:00.465 --> 12:02.541
- Never brought on the end of the world.
- Ha, ha.

12:02.717 --> 12:05.126
- All right. That's enough.
- Guys, this isn't helping. Dean.

12:05.304 --> 12:08.056
Look, there are a couple hundred more
demons out there now.

12:08.224 --> 12:09.637
We don't know where they are.

12:09.811 --> 12:13.975
When they'll strike. There ain't enough
hunters to handle something like this.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.561
You brought war down on us.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.980
- On all of us.
Okay.

12:17.153 --> 12:20.156
That's quite enough testosterone
for now.

13:03.176 --> 13:04.884
I'll check that.

13:06.681 --> 13:10.016
We've got it in a 34.
Oh, yeah. Okay.

13:10.186 --> 13:12.310
Is that all right?
I think so.

13:15.902 --> 13:18.359
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

13:20.325 --> 13:23.611
Those are nice shoes.

13:23.996 --> 13:26.833
Yeah. They are nice.

13:34.218 --> 13:36.972
- Those are nice shoes.
- Aren't they?

13:38.391 --> 13:41.642
- I want them.
- Sorry, last pair.

13:51.159 --> 13:52.987
Excuse me?

13:53.162 --> 13:54.823
I want those shoes.

13:54.998 --> 13:56.623
What, are you crazy? No.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.203
What? What the...?

14:18.698 --> 14:21.984
About 10 minutes ago.
Back there.

14:24.789 --> 14:27.116
I think you better call Grissom.
Check that.

14:30.380 --> 14:33.667
What happened outside makes
you realize how fragile life really is.

14:33.843 --> 14:36.336
You gotta make every second count.

14:38.683 --> 14:41.389
- Excuse me a minute, would you?
- Sure.

14:42.688 --> 14:46.106
- Dean, what are you doing?
- Comforting the bereaved.

14:46.277 --> 14:47.855
- What are you doing?
- Working.

14:48.029 --> 14:50.272
Dead body. Possible demon attack,
that kind of stuff.

14:51.659 --> 14:54.864
Sam, I'm sorry. It's just, you know,
I don't have much time left, and, uh...

14:57.125 --> 14:59.000
...I gotta make every second count.

14:59.170 --> 15:02.125
- Yeah, right. All right. I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted.

15:02.300 --> 15:06.049
Whoa. Looking spiffy, Bobby.
What were you, a G-man?

15:06.221 --> 15:08.179
Returning from the DA's office.

15:08.349 --> 15:10.842
- Just spoke to the suspect.
- Yeah?

15:11.020 --> 15:13.856
- What do you think? Was she possessed?
Don't think so.

15:14.024 --> 15:19.021
There's none of the usual signs.
No blackouts, no loss of control.

15:19.198 --> 15:23.066
Totally lucid. Just think
she really wanted those shoes.

15:23.245 --> 15:26.412
Spilled a glass of holy water on her,
just to be sure. Nothing.

15:26.582 --> 15:28.292
Maybe she's just
some random whack job.

15:28.461 --> 15:33.290
If it had been an isolated incident,
maybe. But first the family, now this?

15:33.467 --> 15:36.920
I believe in a lot of things.
Coincidence ain't one of them.

15:37.098 --> 15:40.099
- Did you boys find anything around here?
- No sulphur.

15:40.268 --> 15:42.345
- Nothing.
- Well, maybe something.

15:45.985 --> 15:48.393
See? I'm working.

15:49.740 --> 15:54.487
Anything interesting?
- I don't know, yet. Might just be a guy.

15:55.164 --> 15:56.623
Or it might be our guy.

16:34.844 --> 16:36.637
What time is it?

16:37.849 --> 16:39.047
Seven past midnight.

16:40.435 --> 16:42.594
You sure this is the right place?
No.

16:42.771 --> 16:45.061
But I spent all day
canvassing this stupid town...

16:45.234 --> 16:47.357
...with this guy's stupid mug...

16:47.528 --> 16:50.815
...and supposedly he drinks
at this stupid bar...

16:50.991 --> 16:52.190
Oh!

16:53.996 --> 16:55.788
- It's not funny.
Yeah.

16:55.957 --> 16:58.199
All right, so...

16:58.377 --> 17:01.129
So John Doe's name is, uh,
Walter Rosen.

17:01.297 --> 17:04.632
He's from Oak Park just west
of Chicago. Went missing a week ago.

17:04.801 --> 17:06.842
- The night the Devil's Gate opened?
- Yep.

17:07.013 --> 17:08.840
- Think he's possessed?
It's a good bet.

17:09.016 --> 17:11.259
So, uh, he just walks up to someone,
touches them...

17:11.436 --> 17:13.097
...and they go psycho or something?

17:13.271 --> 17:17.057
Those demons that got out, they'll be
able to do things we haven't seen.

17:17.236 --> 17:20.737
- You mean, the demons we let out.
- Guys.

17:25.204 --> 17:26.782
All right. Showtime.

17:26.957 --> 17:28.417
- Wait a minute.
- What?

17:28.586 --> 17:29.914
What did I just say?

17:30.087 --> 17:32.294
We don't know what to expect
out of this guy.

17:32.465 --> 17:36.085
- We should tail him till we know.
- So he kills someone and we sit here?

17:36.262 --> 17:37.806
We're no good dead.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.268
We're not gonna make a move
till we know what the score is.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.726
Hey, Bobby,
I don't think that's an option.

17:44.190 --> 17:45.935
Why not?

17:51.784 --> 17:52.899
Damn it.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.289
- Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.

18:27.583 --> 18:29.708
Pull the car in back.

18:30.254 --> 18:32.128
We'll be right out.

18:32.966 --> 18:36.667
- I love you.
- I know.

18:42.980 --> 18:45.020
What do you think you're doing?

18:45.191 --> 18:47.980
- I'm just hitting the head.
No.

18:48.821 --> 18:52.523
I mean,
what do you think you're doing here?

18:55.164 --> 18:58.165
I don't like hunters in my bar.

19:17.819 --> 19:21.606
Man,
you really walked into the wrong place.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.045
Hold on. I like the girl.

19:30.629 --> 19:32.670
Wish I had me a girl like that.

19:33.007 --> 19:36.045
I could think of about a thousand things
I'd like to do to her.

19:36.220 --> 19:38.677
You're not gonna lay one filthy finger
on her.

19:38.849 --> 19:41.056
I have something for you.

19:41.978 --> 19:45.313
Here. Have a drink on me.

19:47.069 --> 19:48.729
Isaac?

19:52.951 --> 19:54.576
On the house.

19:54.745 --> 19:56.538
Isaac.

20:00.671 --> 20:02.580
Isaac!

20:02.882 --> 20:06.798
Isaac, no! Baby, please!

20:20.322 --> 20:22.233
Oh, he's down.

20:23.202 --> 20:24.863
All right, honey. Your turn.

20:36.512 --> 20:38.173
- Isaac! No!
- Come on, we gotta go!

20:38.348 --> 20:40.009
No, no, no, he's dead.
- Isaac, no!

20:40.184 --> 20:41.844
Get in the car.

20:46.442 --> 20:47.819
Isaac! Isaac!
- Let's go!

20:47.987 --> 20:49.185
Dean, come on!

21:04.843 --> 21:07.928
Go, go, go!

21:19.530 --> 21:22.069
And I say we're going back.

21:22.242 --> 21:25.612
Just hold on a second.
I left my husband on the floor.

21:25.789 --> 21:27.948
Okay, I understand that,
but we can't go back.

21:28.125 --> 21:30.249
Fine, then you stay.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.959
- But I'm heading back to that bar.
- I'll go with her.

21:33.132 --> 21:36.632
- It's suicide, Dean.
- So what? I'm dead already.

21:37.513 --> 21:40.184
How you gonna kill them?
You can't shoot them.

21:40.351 --> 21:43.269
You can't stab them.
They're not gonna wait to get exorcised.

21:43.438 --> 21:46.108
- I don't care!
- We don't know how many there are.

21:46.275 --> 21:47.771
Yeah, we do.

21:47.945 --> 21:49.439
There's seven.

21:49.613 --> 21:52.948
Do you have any idea
who we're up against?

21:53.118 --> 21:57.165
- No. Who?
- The seven deadly sins.

21:57.333 --> 21:59.076
Live and in the flesh.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.455
"What's in the box?" Heh.

22:07.054 --> 22:10.056
<i>Brad Pitt? Se7 en? No?</i>

22:12.645 --> 22:15.102
- What's this?
Classification of demons.

22:15.274 --> 22:18.858
In 1589, Binsfeld ID'd the seven sins.

22:19.029 --> 22:22.400
Not just as human vices,
but as actual devils.

22:22.951 --> 22:25.574
The family.
They were touched by Sloth.

22:25.747 --> 22:27.989
- And the shopper.
- That's Envy's doing.

22:28.166 --> 22:30.326
The customer we got
in the next room.

22:30.504 --> 22:32.995
I couldn't suss it out at first,
until Isaac.

22:33.174 --> 22:35.001
He was touched
with an awful gluttony.

22:35.176 --> 22:38.962
I don't give a rat's ass if they're
the Three Stooges or the Four Tops.

22:39.141 --> 22:41.597
I'm gonna slaughter
every last one of them.

22:41.769 --> 22:44.058
We already did it your way.

22:44.230 --> 22:47.981
You burst in there half-cocked
and look what happened.

22:48.153 --> 22:50.941
These demons haven't been top side
in half a millennium.

22:51.115 --> 22:53.785
We're talking medieval, Dark Ages.

22:53.952 --> 22:55.945
We've never faced
anything close to this.

22:56.123 --> 22:58.282
So we are gonna take a breath...

22:58.459 --> 23:01.081
...and figure out
what our next move is!

23:07.555 --> 23:10.093
I am sorry for your loss.

23:27.958 --> 23:29.867
So you know who I am, huh?

23:30.044 --> 23:32.252
We do. We're not impressed.

23:32.423 --> 23:34.546
Now, why are you here?

23:34.717 --> 23:36.627
What are you after?

23:37.137 --> 23:39.546
He asked you a question.

23:42.144 --> 23:43.888
What do you want?

23:56.540 --> 24:01.119
We already have what we want.

24:02.631 --> 24:04.339
What's that?

24:04.550 --> 24:06.425
We're out.

24:07.847 --> 24:09.638
We're free.

24:09.807 --> 24:13.224
Thanks to you,
my kind are everywhere.

24:14.314 --> 24:18.183
"I am legion, for we are many. "

24:20.197 --> 24:22.154
So me, I'm just celebrating.

24:23.118 --> 24:24.197
Having a little fun.

24:25.246 --> 24:26.705
- Fun?
Yeah.

24:26.998 --> 24:28.991
Fun.

24:29.167 --> 24:32.704
See, some people crochet, others golf.

24:32.881 --> 24:34.257
Me...

24:34.425 --> 24:38.340
...I like to see people's insides...

24:38.513 --> 24:39.713
...on their outside.

24:43.688 --> 24:46.559
- I'm gonna put you down like a dog.
- Please.

24:49.363 --> 24:52.863
You really think you're better than me?
Ha, ha.

24:53.535 --> 24:56.322
Which one of you
can cast the first stone, huh?

24:57.249 --> 24:58.364
What about you, Dean?

24:59.043 --> 25:03.540
You're practically a...
A walking billboard of gluttony and lust.

25:04.257 --> 25:07.011
And Tamara. All that wrath?

25:07.179 --> 25:09.505
Ooh. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

25:09.682 --> 25:13.266
It's the reason you and Isaac became
hunters in the first place, isn't it?

25:13.437 --> 25:17.187
It's so much easier
to drink in the rage...

25:17.359 --> 25:22.023
...than to face what really happened
all those years ago.

25:30.419 --> 25:34.834
My point exactly.
And you call us sins.

25:35.009 --> 25:36.717
We're not sins, man.

25:36.886 --> 25:39.758
We are natural human instinct.

25:39.933 --> 25:43.018
And you can repress and deny us
all you want...

25:43.187 --> 25:47.316
...but the truth is,
you are just animals.

25:48.653 --> 25:51.988
Horny, greedy...

25:52.533 --> 25:56.864
...hungry, heh, violent animals.

25:57.707 --> 25:59.250
And you know what?

25:59.418 --> 26:01.328
You'll be slaughtered like animals too.

26:07.137 --> 26:09.130
The others?

26:09.724 --> 26:10.803
They're coming for me.

26:12.560 --> 26:14.055
Maybe...

26:16.441 --> 26:18.565
...but they're not gonna find you...

26:18.736 --> 26:20.279
...because you'll be in hell.

26:24.870 --> 26:27.575
Someone send this clown packing.

26:28.291 --> 26:30.367
My pleasure.

26:43.103 --> 26:45.559
I don't think we're gonna have to worry
about hunting them.

26:45.732 --> 26:48.984
- What does that mean?
- I think maybe this joker's right.

26:49.154 --> 26:52.939
They're gonna be hunting us,
and they're not gonna quit easy.

26:53.576 --> 26:57.361
Guys, take Tamara and head for the hills.
I'll stay, slow them down, buy time.

26:57.540 --> 27:00.459
You're insane, Dean.
Just forget about it, okay?

27:01.462 --> 27:03.372
Sam's right.

27:03.548 --> 27:06.040
There's six of them, guys.

27:06.219 --> 27:09.055
We're outmanned, we're outgunned.
We'll be dead by dawn.

27:09.223 --> 27:12.308
Maybe, but there's no place to run
that they won't find us.

27:12.477 --> 27:16.429
Look, if we're going down,
we're going down together, all right?

27:19.320 --> 27:21.942
- Well, let's not make it easy for them.
Aargh!

27:29.292 --> 27:30.751
Demon's out of the guy.

27:30.919 --> 27:34.171
- And the guy?
- He didn't make it.

28:05.967 --> 28:07.463
Here we go.

28:39.013 --> 28:40.674
Tamara!

28:41.893 --> 28:43.970
Tamara!

28:47.066 --> 28:50.104
Tamara!

28:50.655 --> 28:53.111
Tamara!

28:56.704 --> 28:58.782
Help me!

28:59.042 --> 29:00.287
Please!

29:05.383 --> 29:07.424
Tamara!

29:08.513 --> 29:12.642
I got away, but I'm hurt bad.

29:12.810 --> 29:14.269
I need help.

29:14.437 --> 29:16.099
It's not him.

29:16.274 --> 29:19.359
One of those demons
is possessing his corpse.

29:20.821 --> 29:23.942
Baby! Why won't you let me in?

29:25.078 --> 29:26.952
You left me behind back there.

29:28.332 --> 29:29.791
How could you do that?

29:30.835 --> 29:36.342
We swore at that lake in Michigan,
remember?

29:37.177 --> 29:39.634
We swore
we would never leave each other.

29:39.806 --> 29:41.930
- How did he know that?
- Steady, Tamara.

29:42.101 --> 29:45.934
- Steady, Tamara, steady.
- You're just gonna leave me out here?

29:46.106 --> 29:48.598
You're just gonna let me die?

29:51.156 --> 29:54.407
I guess that's what you'd do, dear.

29:55.161 --> 29:58.079
Like that night
those things came to our house.

29:58.833 --> 30:02.369
Came for our daughter.

30:02.546 --> 30:06.248
- You just let her die too.
- You son of a bitch!

30:06.426 --> 30:08.219
Tamara, no!

30:11.183 --> 30:13.176
- You're not Isaac.
- Aah!

30:38.512 --> 30:41.680
Fat, drunk and stupid
is no way to go through life, son.

31:00.543 --> 31:02.750
I suppose you're Lust.

31:03.255 --> 31:05.925
- Baby, I'm whatever you want me to be.
- Yeah, all right.

31:06.092 --> 31:07.635
- Just stay back.
- Or what?

31:08.680 --> 31:11.088
- Good point.
- Mm. I'm not gonna hurt you.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.798
Not yet.

31:13.686 --> 31:16.012
Not unless you want me to.

31:26.746 --> 31:28.371
Here's Johnny.

31:35.467 --> 31:36.926
Come on.

31:37.094 --> 31:40.594
You really think something like that
is gonna fool someone like me?

31:40.765 --> 31:42.593
I mean, me?

31:42.769 --> 31:44.014
Let me guess.

31:44.187 --> 31:46.014
You're Pride.

31:50.570 --> 31:54.023
Mm. The root of all sin.

31:54.201 --> 31:56.028
And you...

31:56.912 --> 31:58.537
...are Sam Winchester.

32:00.293 --> 32:03.413
That's right, I've heard of you.
We've all heard of you.

32:03.589 --> 32:07.504
The prodigy. The Boy King.

32:08.011 --> 32:12.675
Looking at you now, I gotta tell you,
don't believe the hype.

32:13.769 --> 32:18.232
You think I'm gonna bow to a cut-rate,
piss-poor human like you?

32:18.401 --> 32:20.394
I have my pride, after all.

32:22.114 --> 32:27.075
Now with your yellow-eyed friend dead,
I don't have to do a damn thing, do I?

32:28.164 --> 32:32.329
You're fair game now, boy,
and it's open season.

33:05.382 --> 33:06.711
You.

33:32.378 --> 33:36.544
Who the hell are you?
- I'm the girl that just saved your ass.

33:38.136 --> 33:40.545
Well, I just saved yours too.

33:41.224 --> 33:42.386
See you around, Sam.

33:43.853 --> 33:45.597
Wait!

34:22.489 --> 34:24.696
Think she's gonna be all right?

34:24.867 --> 34:27.656
No, definitely not.

34:30.918 --> 34:32.911
Well, you look like hell warmed over.

34:33.087 --> 34:36.920
Well, you try exorcising all night,
see how you feel.

34:37.092 --> 34:38.754
Any survivors, Bobby?

34:38.929 --> 34:41.764
Well, the pretty girl and the heavy guy.
They'll make it.

34:41.933 --> 34:44.306
Lifetime of therapy bills ahead,
but still.

34:44.478 --> 34:46.969
It's more than you can say
for these poor bastards.

34:49.150 --> 34:51.190
Bobby, that knife.

34:51.487 --> 34:53.612
What kind of blade can kill a demon?

34:53.783 --> 34:56.784
- I'd have said there was no such thing.
- I'm just gonna ask again.

34:56.954 --> 34:59.955
Who was that masked chick?
The more troubling question would be...

35:00.124 --> 35:02.664
...how come a girl can fight better
than you?

35:02.837 --> 35:04.961
- Three demons, Dean. At once.
- Oh.

35:05.757 --> 35:08.545
Hey, whatever it takes
to get you through the night, pal.

35:09.137 --> 35:11.464
- Lf you want a question, I got one.
- What's that?

35:11.641 --> 35:15.687
If we let out the seven deadly sins,
what else did we let out?

35:17.900 --> 35:20.308
You're right, that is troubling.

35:31.418 --> 35:33.660
See you gents around.

35:33.838 --> 35:35.547
Tamara?

35:37.510 --> 35:39.053
World just got a lot scarier.

35:40.013 --> 35:41.722
Be careful.

35:42.850 --> 35:44.643
You too.

35:50.277 --> 35:53.031
Keep your eyes peeled for omens.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.613
- I'll do the same.
You got it.

35:55.785 --> 35:57.529
Hey, Bobby?

35:59.582 --> 36:02.750
We can win this war, right?

36:11.224 --> 36:13.466
Catch you on the next one.

36:27.830 --> 36:29.788
So where to?

36:31.293 --> 36:32.372
Uh...

36:32.544 --> 36:35.000
I don't know.
I was thinking Louisiana, maybe.

36:35.173 --> 36:38.674
- Little early for Mardi Gras, isn't it?
- Yeah. I was talking to Tamara...

36:38.845 --> 36:40.922
...and she mentioned
this Hoodoo priestess...

36:41.098 --> 36:43.969
...that might be able to help us out,
you know, with your...

36:44.144 --> 36:45.259
Your demon deal.

36:46.397 --> 36:47.429
Nah.

36:47.607 --> 36:50.359
Nah? What does that mean, "Nah?"

36:50.527 --> 36:53.234
No Hoodoo spell's gonna break this deal.
It's a goose chase.

36:53.407 --> 36:56.029
- We don't know that.
- Yes, we do. Forget it, she can't help.

36:56.202 --> 36:58.611
- Look it's...
- We're not going and that's that.

36:59.164 --> 37:02.333
- What about Reno? Huh?
- You know what?

37:03.421 --> 37:04.963
I've had it.

37:05.131 --> 37:08.216
I've been bending over backwards
trying to be nice to you...

37:08.385 --> 37:10.095
...and I don't care anymore.

37:10.264 --> 37:12.008
- That didn't last long.
- You know what?

37:12.183 --> 37:14.223
I've been busting my ass
trying to keep you alive.

37:14.394 --> 37:16.268
And you act
like you couldn't care less.

37:16.438 --> 37:17.814
You got some kind of death wish?

37:17.982 --> 37:19.478
- No, it's not that.
- What's it like?

37:19.652 --> 37:22.025
- Sam...
- Please, tell me.

37:24.616 --> 37:26.159
We trapped a Crossroads demon.

37:26.577 --> 37:30.791
Trick it, try to welch our way
out of the deal in any way, you die.

37:31.167 --> 37:32.578
Okay?

37:32.753 --> 37:36.040
You die. Those are the terms.
There's no way out of it.

37:36.216 --> 37:39.551
If you try to find a way, so help me God,
I'm gonna stop you.

37:44.477 --> 37:46.305
How could you make that deal, Dean?

37:47.857 --> 37:49.815
Because I couldn't live with you dead.

37:49.985 --> 37:52.903
- Couldn't do it.
- So, what now? I live and you die?

37:53.072 --> 37:57.072
- That's the general idea, yeah.
- Yeah, well, you're a hypocrite, Dean.

37:57.245 --> 38:00.911
How did you feel when Dad sold his soul
for you? I was there. I remember.

38:01.083 --> 38:05.664
You were twisted and broken
and now you go and do the same thing.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.251
To me.

38:08.552 --> 38:10.630
What you did was selfish.

38:10.806 --> 38:14.472
Yeah, you're right, it was selfish,
but I'm okay with that.

38:14.978 --> 38:16.176
- I'm not.
- Tough.

38:16.355 --> 38:19.808
After everything I've done
for this family, I think I'm entitled.

38:21.112 --> 38:26.737
Truth is, I'm tired, Sam. It's like
there's a light at the end of the tunnel.

38:26.911 --> 38:29.154
- That's hellfire, Dean.
- Eh. Well, whatever.

38:29.331 --> 38:33.829
You're alive, I feel good
for the first time in a long time.

38:34.421 --> 38:37.875
I got a year to live, Sam.
I'd like to make the most of it.

38:38.052 --> 38:42.549
So, what do you say we kill some evil
sons of bitches. We raise a little hell?

38:45.729 --> 38:47.473
You're unbelievable.

38:49.192 --> 38:51.019
Very true.
