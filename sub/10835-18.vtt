WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:03.044
Previously on 90210:

00:03.170 --> 00:04.421
We're in two
different places.

00:04.546 --> 00:06.131
It's not your fault.
It's because

00:06.256 --> 00:07.716
we've grown apart.

00:07.842 --> 00:09.217
Let's end this.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.803
Hey, Naomi.
See, that's not fair.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.346
You know my name,
but I don't know yours.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.597
Liam.

00:13.722 --> 00:14.682
NAOMI:
Liam's a psychopath

00:14.807 --> 00:16.558
and an awesome kisser.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.644
You filmed us having sex?!
What's wrong with you?

00:18.769 --> 00:20.145
I love you.
Silver, listen...

00:20.270 --> 00:21.981
(screams)

00:22.105 --> 00:24.358
I don't know
what's going on anymore.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.067
You are the reason
we are out here looking
for her right now.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.903
She lives with you, Kelly,
not me, okay?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.404
You're the one who's
supposed to be taking

00:29.530 --> 00:30.865
care of her.
DIXON:
Silver!

00:30.990 --> 00:32.240
I know what
you're going through.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.784
My mom used to go through
the same type of thing.

00:33.909 --> 00:36.286
Silver has bipolar disorder,

00:36.411 --> 00:38.413
just like my birth mom.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.586
♪ A thousand times
I've seen you standing... ♪

00:44.712 --> 00:45.963
DIXON:
Oh, so apparently

00:46.087 --> 00:47.798
they're going to be re-carpeting
the school library.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.383
Oh, yeah?

00:49.508 --> 00:51.385
They're going to be doing it
over spring break.

00:51.510 --> 00:52.761
spring break.

00:52.887 --> 00:54.513
Right.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.515
I'm so out of it.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.099
Is everybody psyched?

00:58.225 --> 00:59.810
Yeah.

00:59.935 --> 01:01.478
Half of the senior class is
going to be partying

01:01.603 --> 01:05.147
on Jake Olson's uncle's yacht
in, uh, in the Greek Isles.

01:05.272 --> 01:06.149
Supposedly his uncle

01:06.274 --> 01:07.985
also invited Keith Richards,

01:08.109 --> 01:10.362
uh, one of the Pussycat Dolls
and...

01:10.487 --> 01:12.072
Cookie?

01:13.699 --> 01:15.826
Um, sure.

01:15.951 --> 01:18.370
Thanks.
You know, you can have
a second if you'd like,

01:18.495 --> 01:19.454
Silver, they're low sugar.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.455
No kidding.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.165
No, thanks.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.002
So, are there any
underclassmen

01:25.126 --> 01:26.754
going to this
yacht shindig or...

01:26.879 --> 01:28.005
You know what, can we

01:28.129 --> 01:29.840
change the subject,
maybe talk about

01:29.965 --> 01:31.383
something else
a little less stimulating?

01:31.508 --> 01:32.760
I'm sorry.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.845
I don't mean
to be a drag.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.680
It's just someone
with bipolar disorder

01:36.805 --> 01:39.182
needs to maintain
balance.

01:39.307 --> 01:41.142
Right. You know,
I totally get it.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.561
Yeah. So, um...

01:42.686 --> 01:44.563
what's new?

01:44.688 --> 01:45.773
How was your yesterday?

01:45.898 --> 01:47.733
Um, let's see...

01:47.858 --> 01:49.818
I woke up, took my meds,

01:49.944 --> 01:51.194
had breakfast
with Kelly.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.529
Did my homework,

01:52.654 --> 01:55.741
had lunch with Kelly,
went to see my therapist,

01:55.866 --> 01:57.576
read an
unstimulating book,

01:57.701 --> 01:58.535
had dinner with Kelly,

01:58.660 --> 01:59.494
took more meds,

01:59.620 --> 02:01.246
wrote in my journal,
listened to some

02:01.371 --> 02:03.206
unstimulating music

02:03.331 --> 02:04.583
and went to sleep.

02:04.708 --> 02:05.751
It was a blast.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.795
DIXON:
Structure's
important.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.213
I'm sure.

02:10.338 --> 02:11.339
DONNA:
Yes, it is.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.550
Speaking of structure,
Dixon,

02:13.675 --> 02:14.885
I'm sorry, but I think

02:15.010 --> 02:16.261
that's enough
visiting for now.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.471
Sure, no problem.

02:17.596 --> 02:18.889
Hey, Kelly?

02:19.014 --> 02:20.432
Can we get some privacy
to say good-bye?

02:20.557 --> 02:22.559
Oh, sure.

02:22.684 --> 02:23.727
Yeah, of course.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.106
I'll come over tomorrow,
if you want.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.400
Dixon, you should take
a breather.

02:30.525 --> 02:32.235
Go somewhere for spring break.

02:32.360 --> 02:34.404
I was thinking about it.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.740
But the thought of leaving
when you maybe needed me

02:36.865 --> 02:37.866
seemed kind of crazy.

02:37.992 --> 02:39.242
It's okay.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.410
Just go.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.495
Have some fun.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.413
I mean it.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.582
Maybe.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.710
I'll call you later?

02:49.878 --> 02:51.170
Not after 8:00.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.636
♪ Singing ♪

02:57.761 --> 02:59.596
♪ Sweetly... ♪

02:59.721 --> 03:01.640
(Dixon chuckling)

03:01.765 --> 03:03.767
T-minus six hours

03:03.892 --> 03:05.268
until spring break freedom.

03:05.393 --> 03:06.520
Whatever.

03:06.645 --> 03:07.688
Who cares?

03:07.813 --> 03:09.397
Whoa.

03:09.523 --> 03:13.318
Call me the most perceptive
brother in the world,

03:13.443 --> 03:14.862
but I think you're not
totally excited

03:14.987 --> 03:16.488
about said break.

03:16.613 --> 03:17.698
It's just...

03:17.823 --> 03:19.574
You know, me and Ethan were
going to spend

03:19.700 --> 03:20.617
the whole vacation together,

03:20.742 --> 03:22.828
and do all of these
fun L.A. things

03:22.953 --> 03:24.538
that we never have time to do.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.498
And then I was gonna
get my prom dress.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.916
But now instead

03:28.042 --> 03:30.293
I'll just spend
the whole time alone,

03:30.418 --> 03:31.920
wallowing in my
post-breakup funk.

03:32.046 --> 03:33.630
Well, instead
of wallowing,

03:33.755 --> 03:36.591
how would you feel about a
little brother-sister road trip?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.635
Are you serious?

03:38.760 --> 03:39.845
Yeah. Silver's pretty
much holed up

03:39.970 --> 03:41.346
with Kelly 24/seven.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.974
Come on, I miss... I miss
hanging out with you.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.851
We used to do stuff
together all the time.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.352
Ever since we got here...

03:47.477 --> 03:49.980
I don't know, it just seems like

03:50.105 --> 03:51.481
we don't have any
one-on-one time.

03:51.606 --> 03:52.900
I know.

03:53.025 --> 03:54.860
Well, a road trip to where?

03:54.985 --> 03:57.654
I was thinking Arizona.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.740
What's in Arizona?

03:59.865 --> 04:01.491
Adventure.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.744
Oh, and about five water parks

04:03.869 --> 04:05.996
all within a 150-mile radius.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.707
What, water parks?
Are you serious?

04:08.832 --> 04:11.168
Uh, that's if you
don't love 'em anymore.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.753
Oh, you bite your
blasphemous tongue.

04:12.878 --> 04:15.839
But Mom and Dad are never going
to let us go to Arizona alone.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.632
Yeah, but they will let us
go to Grandma's house

04:18.759 --> 04:20.343
in Palm Springs.

04:20.468 --> 04:21.595
J-Just saying.

04:23.346 --> 04:26.474
I know how much you're all going
to miss me over spring break,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.685
so for those of you who
just can't bear it,

04:28.810 --> 04:30.520
I still have a few
slots left open

04:30.645 --> 04:32.689
on my Habitat for Humanity trip.

04:32.814 --> 04:33.941
Volunteer house-building crap?

04:34.066 --> 04:35.859
Yeah, otherwise known
as a chance to help victims

04:35.984 --> 04:37.736
of the California wildfires
rebuild their lives.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.947
Unless there's going to be
drunk chicks doing body shots,

04:40.072 --> 04:41.322
I'm gonna stick
with South Beach.

04:41.448 --> 04:42.699
You're such
a pig, Jaime.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.451
Thank you, Naomi.

04:44.576 --> 04:45.660
Any interest?

04:45.786 --> 04:48.122
Build houses for poor people--

04:48.247 --> 04:50.916
have poor people wait on me
hand and foot in Cabo...

04:51.041 --> 04:52.542
Tough choice.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.627
Let me ask you this--

04:53.752 --> 04:55.170
how many times have you
been to Cabo?

04:55.295 --> 04:56.880
Hmm, probably as many times
as you've been

04:57.005 --> 04:59.340
to whatever discount shoe store
you frequent.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.009
(students chuckle)
Don't any of you want

05:01.135 --> 05:02.844
to do something different
every once in a while?

05:02.970 --> 05:04.221
You know, experience

05:04.345 --> 05:06.347
something you haven't
experienced before

05:06.473 --> 05:08.558
or, uh, learn something
about yourselves?

05:08.683 --> 05:10.393
I'll sign up.

05:10.518 --> 05:11.561
Seriously?

05:11.686 --> 05:12.562
Seriously?

05:12.687 --> 05:14.106
Why not?

05:14.231 --> 05:16.066
I want to experience things
I've never experienced before.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.901
Take a risk, for a change.
JAIME:
Me, too.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.445
That's why I'm going to Vegas
with my dad's black card.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.447
That sounds real meaningful.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.074
Glad to have you, Ethan.
Will you pass this back?

05:24.199 --> 05:25.659
I cannot believe we ever dated.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.661
I mean, the fact that you find
this trip

05:27.786 --> 05:29.746
even remotely interesting is...

05:29.871 --> 05:30.914
(bell ringing)

05:36.878 --> 05:40.799
Hey, you. I didn't know you
signed up for the... Ugh...

05:40.924 --> 05:42.843
Habitat for Humanity
trip. I did, too.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.094
How excited are you

05:44.219 --> 05:45.553
about giving something
back to poor people?

05:45.679 --> 05:46.680
I'm in Matthews'
sociology elective

05:46.805 --> 05:47.806
and I cut a few classes.

05:47.931 --> 05:49.390
He's making me go.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.934
Otherwise he's going to fail me.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.644
It sucks.
Yeah, I know,
it totally sucks.

05:52.769 --> 05:55.022
I'm actually being made
to go to by, you know, family.

05:55.147 --> 05:56.731
But I guess, silver lining,

05:56.857 --> 05:58.984
it looks like we'll be able
to spend some time together.

05:59.109 --> 06:02.445
Yeah, maybe.

06:02.570 --> 06:03.989
See you later.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.664
Silver?

06:12.789 --> 06:14.166
You okay?

06:15.625 --> 06:17.085
I was in the shower.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.504
For an hour?

06:19.629 --> 06:21.380
Just looking for
a little privacy.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.594
KELLY:
Right.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.429
Here.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.476
Okay...

06:33.601 --> 06:35.603
it's time for your mood chart.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.064
Let's see here--

06:37.189 --> 06:38.815
it's 9:30.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.025
What is your mood?

06:40.150 --> 06:42.694
Irritated.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.780
Okay, irritated.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.866
How irritated, on a scale
of one to ten?

06:47.991 --> 06:50.744
I was at a four,
but you asked me--

06:50.869 --> 06:51.953
that bumped me up to a six.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.332
Six, okay, then.

06:55.456 --> 06:58.085
How would you
like to spend
your time before bed?

06:58.210 --> 06:59.460
Would you like to journal?

06:59.586 --> 07:01.046
No, I would not like to journal.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.631
Nor would I like to use
the word "journal" as a verb.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.510
Okay, um... what do you
want to do, then?

07:07.635 --> 07:09.804
Nothing. Just sit here
in silence.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.681
Okay, fine.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.184
(sighs)

07:17.062 --> 07:19.480
(doorbell ringing)

07:20.941 --> 07:22.901
I'll get it.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.029
(gasps)
Surprise!

07:26.154 --> 07:27.072
Donna!

07:27.197 --> 07:29.157
Oh, my gosh! Oh!

07:45.465 --> 07:48.593
KELLY:
Oh, Ruby, look at you. Oh!

07:48.718 --> 07:50.929
Now, you don't have to take
your shoes off.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.473
I'm so used to doing
it in Japan.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.725
You know what, I'll take
whatever height I can get.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.894
I don't want to look
like a pipsqueak next to

07:58.019 --> 07:59.729
my half-sister-in-law who's so
grown up and so beautiful.

07:59.854 --> 08:02.190
And, Silver, come here
and give me a hug.

08:02.316 --> 08:04.067
How are you?
I've been better.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.944
But I've been
a lot worse.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.280
And I'm so happy
that you're here.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.865
Don't worry--
not too happy.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.326
DONNA:
I'm happy to be here.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.911
When Kelly told me what
you went through,

08:15.036 --> 08:17.789
all I wanted to do was
come to L.A. and hug you.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.499
Thanks.
Oh, what about
your work?

08:19.624 --> 08:21.709
Won't the entire Japanese
fashion world collapse

08:21.835 --> 08:23.044
in your absence?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.922
Well, there'll probably be a
lot of skyping and e-mailing

08:26.047 --> 08:27.132
to remind my employees

08:27.257 --> 08:29.259
which end of the zipper goes
at the top of the dress,

08:29.384 --> 08:30.885
but they'll survive.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.388
I'm in L.A.
I hugged Silver.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.890
Now Ruby and I can go
check into a hotel.
No way!

08:37.017 --> 08:38.768
Sammy's visiting Dylan, so you
guys can stay in his room.

08:38.893 --> 08:39.769
Yeah.

08:39.894 --> 08:40.895
Okay?
Okay.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.272
So what can I get you?

08:42.397 --> 08:44.983
We have juice, water, wine.

08:45.108 --> 08:45.859
Oh, uh, we have

08:45.984 --> 08:46.860
some amazing

08:46.985 --> 08:48.236
sugar-free cookies.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.279
They taste like Styrofoam.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.572
That sounds delicious.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.782
But you
know what,

08:52.907 --> 08:54.701
I'm going to make
you guys some tea.

08:54.826 --> 08:56.453
We'll have our
own little chanoyu,

08:56.577 --> 08:57.745
which is the Japanese
tea ceremony.

08:57.871 --> 08:58.997
Ooh.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.123
Look at you, all
worldly and stuff.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.292
Oh, shut up.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.002
No, you're famous.
You are.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.837
What can I say?

09:05.962 --> 09:08.298
The French have Jerry Lewis,
the Japanese have Donna Martin.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.841
Who knew?

09:09.966 --> 09:11.092
Okay, you go make some tea

09:11.218 --> 09:12.719
and then you can
tell us all about

09:12.844 --> 09:14.595
your glamorous life.
Yes, and do not leave out

09:14.721 --> 09:15.680
a sequin.

09:15.805 --> 09:17.057
Uh, actually,

09:17.182 --> 09:18.266
Silver,

09:18.392 --> 09:19.809
you have to get to bed.

09:19.934 --> 09:20.810
Sorry.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.687
Fine.

09:22.812 --> 09:23.897
Good night, Donna.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.774
Good night.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.402
Night, Kelly.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.406
I'll explain. I have
a lot to tell you.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.418
Okay, so we just
have to call Mom and Dad

09:44.543 --> 09:47.212
in an hour and 45 minutes
and let them know

09:47.337 --> 09:48.838
that we made it
to Palm Springs.

09:48.963 --> 09:52.133
Nice.

09:52.259 --> 09:53.218
You are one crafty sister.

09:53.343 --> 09:55.262
I know.
Brother-sister road trip.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.763
Brother-sister road trip.

09:56.888 --> 09:57.722
(laughing)

09:57.847 --> 09:59.224
All right, so look,

09:59.349 --> 10:01.935
the first song of a road trip--
super important, all right?

10:02.060 --> 10:03.603
Sets the whole tone.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.939
You know what we've got
to listen to, right?
Mm-hmm.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.316
"Seasons of Love."
"No Sleep 'Til Brooklyn."

10:08.442 --> 10:10.651
The Beastie Boys?
Rent? Are you serious?

10:10.777 --> 10:12.820
All right, look, look,

10:12.946 --> 10:14.030
the driver controls the music.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.156
The passenger

10:15.282 --> 10:16.657
controls the snacks.

10:16.783 --> 10:17.284
(clearing throat)

10:17.409 --> 10:18.826
May I have

10:18.952 --> 10:20.078
a refreshment, please?

10:20.203 --> 10:21.455
Why, certainly you may.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.542
Yep, it is all yours...

10:25.666 --> 10:29.337
once I start hearing the sweet
sounds of the Rent soundtrack.

10:29.463 --> 10:32.006
Don't, don't don...

10:32.132 --> 10:33.633
Oh.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.137
All right, remember, we
have, we have some time.

10:37.262 --> 10:38.263
We have miles to go.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.181
Watch. Watch. (laughs)

10:42.016 --> 10:44.352
So just you and me.
Mm-hmm.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.729
How will we
pass the time?

10:46.854 --> 10:49.190
Oh, I got
an idea:

10:49.316 --> 10:50.817
sex.

10:50.942 --> 10:52.360
Lots

10:52.486 --> 10:55.071
of sex...
starting now.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.031
Starting later.
No, no, no!

10:57.157 --> 10:58.450
I have an assignment
for my photography class.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.909
I have to line up a nude model.

11:00.034 --> 11:02.412
Hubba hubba.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.205
Really? That's your response?

11:04.331 --> 11:05.748
One hubba too many?

11:05.873 --> 11:07.083
(laughs)

11:07.208 --> 11:10.044
Sorry. You're right.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.465
You know, sweetheart, this is
a professional undertaking

11:13.590 --> 11:16.009
and I, I should behave
accordingly.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.469
I'd appreciate that.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.513
You know something, sweetheart?

11:19.638 --> 11:22.390
I-I haven't watched you work
in a long time.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.810
I want to see
the magic happen.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.270
(chuckles)

11:27.395 --> 11:29.314
I bet you do.
(laughs)

11:32.400 --> 11:35.487
RYAN:
Uh, now look, everyone.
Susanna here is a real stickler

11:35.612 --> 11:37.280
for rules, and you know,
with good reason.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.449
There's a lot of kids,
a lot of power tools.

11:39.574 --> 11:41.951
I'm just saying, I don't want
to take anyone to the hospital,

11:42.076 --> 11:46.373
uh, because I don't know
where it is.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.961
Hi. Play your cards right,

11:52.086 --> 11:53.254
maybe we'll get some
alone time together.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.383
That's an oxymoron.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.301
RYAN:
Uh, one last thing
to be aware of,

11:58.426 --> 11:59.469
this is Chumash country.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.846
So if you find any Native
American artifacts

12:01.971 --> 12:02.972
or anything that might

12:03.097 --> 12:04.891
be worth money,
go ahead and return that to me.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.143
Hope we find some of that
ancient Chumash weed.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.521
I heard that stuff gets
you so messed up!

12:09.646 --> 12:10.397
Are you talking
about peyote?

12:10.522 --> 12:11.481
Which Native Americans used

12:11.606 --> 12:13.316
to expand their minds

12:13.441 --> 12:15.235
and open themselves up
to revelations?

12:15.360 --> 12:16.486
Because I wouldn't recommend it.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.363
You might realize
what an idiot you are.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.906
(laughs)

12:20.031 --> 12:21.908
RYAN:
All right, guys,
that's enough.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.493
Introduce yourselves to Susanna.
She's gonna give

12:23.618 --> 12:25.161
you your assignments.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.038
Let's do some good here,
you know? Let's build a house!

12:27.163 --> 12:28.081
Whoo!

12:31.084 --> 12:32.419
S...

12:35.046 --> 12:35.963
E!

12:38.592 --> 12:39.967
Hey, you.
Liking the trip so far?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.010
Yeah. I mean,
I'm excited

12:41.135 --> 12:42.512
for things to get
going, you know?

12:42.637 --> 12:43.555
But it definitely
feels good

12:43.680 --> 12:44.598
to be doing
something different

12:44.723 --> 12:46.015
and bust out of
my comfort zone...

12:46.140 --> 12:47.058
Yeah, I totally get it.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.435
So listen, if I said
to someone,

12:48.560 --> 12:50.103
"I can't wait to spend
some alone time together,"

12:50.228 --> 12:52.564
and that person said to me,
"That's an oxymoron,"

12:52.689 --> 12:54.190
what do you think
that person meant?

12:54.315 --> 12:57.026
Uh, that it's an oxymoron
to be alone together.

12:57.151 --> 12:59.070
No, not what he meant.
What he meant meant.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.489
What are you
talking about?

13:01.615 --> 13:04.117
Okay, so I have this
little thing going
with Liam.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.745
I don't know.
He's playing it really
close to the vest.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.205
I think he's into me.
I mean, why wouldn't he be?

13:09.330 --> 13:10.749
But then he says
these cryptic things

13:10.873 --> 13:12.500
like "maybe" and
"that's an oxymoron,"

13:12.626 --> 13:14.377
and I'm just, like, "What?"

13:14.502 --> 13:15.503
So, what do you think?

13:15.629 --> 13:16.546
I think, ideally,
you'd talk

13:16.671 --> 13:18.005
to someone else
about this.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.132
Who?

13:19.257 --> 13:22.051
The girls on this trip are
smelly granolas.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.844
I mean, seriously, they're
wearing utility sandals.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.138
And not a single one of them

13:25.263 --> 13:26.847
complimented me on
my adorable little shorts.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.099
(chuckles)

13:28.224 --> 13:29.434
Hey, you could talk to Liam!

13:29.559 --> 13:31.018
Suss out what he
thinks about me.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.186
Yeah, absolutely not.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.521
Great, so you'll
think about it. 'Kay!

13:33.647 --> 13:36.316
No! Not doing it.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.617
No, Monday is
not good enough.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.034
I need the samples
by Friday.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.911
Did you hear back from Paris?

13:49.036 --> 13:50.871
(speaking Japanese)
Karl Lagerfeld...

13:50.997 --> 13:54.917
(speaks Japanese)

13:55.042 --> 13:57.003
Very impressive, Donna.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.338
And also illegal.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.632
You're not allowed to drive
and talk on the phone

14:00.757 --> 14:02.509
at the same time
anymore without a Bluetooth.

14:02.634 --> 14:05.219
Are you serious?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.555
Well, I haven't been behind
the wheel for quite a while.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.432
Oh, by the way, the public
transportation system in Tokyo

14:09.557 --> 14:10.433
is so amazing.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.101
(laughing)

14:12.226 --> 14:13.894
What?

14:14.020 --> 14:16.105
Just picturing you
on the subway.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.566
What? I love the subway.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.151
Well, people change, I guess.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.944
Oh, my gosh.
Speaking of change,

14:22.069 --> 14:23.613
I drove by Now Wear This
the other day.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.365
Oh, our old store.

14:25.490 --> 14:26.825
Yeah!

14:26.949 --> 14:29.118
Now it's a different kind
of boutique.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.287
Specializing in
medical marijuana.

14:31.412 --> 14:32.372
No way.

14:32.497 --> 14:33.956
Way.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.167
Well, maybe if we had sold
hemp clothing

14:36.292 --> 14:37.502
we wouldn't have
gone bankrupt.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.045
Well, we tried,
didn't we?

14:39.170 --> 14:40.213
You can't win 'em all.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.965
What are you talking about?
You won Japan.

14:43.090 --> 14:46.093
And you and David are like
a power couple.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.430
Hey, speaking of David,
how is he?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.140
You haven't said anything
about him.

14:51.265 --> 14:54.101
Oh, David is,
David is fabulous. Fabulous.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.729
He just got a big promotion

14:55.854 --> 14:57.980
and you know that
girl rapper he discovered,

14:58.105 --> 14:59.524
the 15-year-old
from Osaka?
Yeah.

14:59.649 --> 15:00.567
She's totally blowing up.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.569
Oh, you know what?
We have to go

15:02.694 --> 15:04.738
to Opening Ceremony
and to Curve.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.656
We have a lot of
shopping to do.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.662
DIXON:
Look, I'm just saying,

15:12.787 --> 15:14.581
this is the third time
we've stopped already.

15:14.706 --> 15:17.417
Maybe if you stop drinking
so much Dr. Pepper.
We're on a road trip.

15:17.542 --> 15:19.878
Drinking Dr. Pepper is
practically a requirement.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.796
Then the next stop better have
a snack machine,

15:21.921 --> 15:23.089
'cause I need
to be re-chipified.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.091
Hey, Dixon, um...

15:25.216 --> 15:26.676
thanks for suggesting this trip.

15:26.801 --> 15:28.094
It's exactly what I needed.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.764
Yeah. Me, too.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.101
Put the paper down
on the toilet.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.397
(keypad beeping)

15:43.777 --> 15:48.281
Hi. Um...
is Dana Bowen there?

15:51.367 --> 15:52.619
Oh, okay.

15:52.744 --> 15:56.581
Well, um, do you know
when she'll be back from lunch?

15:56.706 --> 15:58.583
Um, no, no, it's cool.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.585
Um, uh, I don't need
to leave a message.

16:00.710 --> 16:03.212
I'll come see her myself.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.967
All right, thank you. Bye.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.111
NAOMI:
Pretty please?

16:27.236 --> 16:29.238
To make up for you
cheating on me with Annie.

16:29.363 --> 16:30.281
No, we were broken up.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.324
Let's not dwell
on the details.

16:31.449 --> 16:32.575
It hurt.
Plus, I'm going

16:32.700 --> 16:34.452
to keep bugging you
until you say yes anyway.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.036
I mean, I never get
tired of bugging.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.622
I could bug you
all day long.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.457
Fine, fine! I'll ask Liam
if he likes you

16:39.582 --> 16:41.334
just so you'll shut up.

16:41.459 --> 16:44.671
Yay! Hey, don't tell him
I sent him, or sent you
or that I like him.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.213
In fact,
don't mention me at all.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.591
Except to, of course, find
out if he likes me. Um...

16:48.716 --> 16:50.217
(quietly):
Just shut up!

16:50.343 --> 16:52.386
Hey, man, I'm Ethan.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.181
Good for you.

16:56.557 --> 16:59.811
Uh, well, hey, look,

16:59.936 --> 17:03.857
I know it's like an awkward
question, but, uh...

17:03.982 --> 17:08.194
do you (clears throat)
like Naomi?

17:08.319 --> 17:09.654
Huh.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.865
Hey, so this must be
the part

17:11.990 --> 17:13.700
where the, uh, jealous
ex-boyfriend comes over

17:13.825 --> 17:14.742
and threatens the new guy.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.452
You gonna punch me now?

17:16.577 --> 17:18.704
No, I'm not going
to punch you.
Oh, come on.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.039
Isn't that how you jocks roll?

17:20.164 --> 17:21.665
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I think it's adorable.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.291
Unfortunately,
I'm not really in the mood

Teenage Mommy-Girl?

I'll pay you for it.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.351
Let me think.

26:42.476 --> 26:43.352
No.

26:43.477 --> 26:45.312
Why not?

26:45.438 --> 26:46.897
Because I don't think
you can handle it.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.732
Oh, yeah?

26:48.857 --> 26:50.317
Well, how about this?

26:50.443 --> 26:52.278
You give me some, or I'll tell
Matthews you're holding.

26:52.403 --> 26:53.695
Think you can handle that?

26:53.820 --> 26:54.696
Blackmail, huh?

26:54.821 --> 26:55.822
Not exactly keeping with

26:55.948 --> 26:57.283
the ancient Chumash spirit.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.453
Fine.

27:00.578 --> 27:02.829
I'll make the tea tomorrow
night, we'll drink it together.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.748
Uh, no thanks, man.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.208
I think I'll be fine on my own.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.335
Easy does it, jock.

27:08.461 --> 27:09.836
This is a pretty
hard-core experience.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.088
You need a guide.

27:11.213 --> 27:12.339
Someone to make sure
you don't freak

27:12.465 --> 27:13.966
and try to saw off
that prized lacrosse arm.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.884
That's the deal.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.970
Otherwise, no dice.

27:29.856 --> 27:31.191
Hey. Sorry.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.443
Did I wake you?
Oh, no.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.112
I had to go to the bathroom,
and I saw the light on.

27:35.237 --> 27:36.405
Can I see?
Of course,
please.

27:36.530 --> 27:37.531
(chuckles)

27:39.533 --> 27:40.826
Oh, wow.

27:40.951 --> 27:42.495
I love this fabric.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.415
Oh.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.708
Um, so, what do you
think of the dress?

27:48.834 --> 27:51.003
It's gorgeous.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.797
But better get back to bed

27:53.922 --> 27:55.882
before the warden
realizes that I'm up.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.927
Hey, Silver,
hold on a sec.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.095
I, uh,

28:00.220 --> 28:01.430
I just want to tell you
a little story.

28:01.555 --> 28:02.431
When I had

28:02.556 --> 28:04.266
my first runway show in Japan,

28:04.391 --> 28:05.809
everything
going great,

28:05.934 --> 28:07.894
until this one model, Yuko,

28:08.020 --> 28:09.729
refused to wear
the heels I picked out.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.857
She went on and
on about how

28:11.982 --> 28:13.275
they were impossible to walk in.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.527
I was furious.

28:14.652 --> 28:16.236
How dare she try
to ruin my show, right?

28:16.362 --> 28:18.364
Yeah, totally.

28:18.489 --> 28:20.115
Well, then I put on said heels.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.783
Walked two steps,
fell flat on my butt.

28:21.908 --> 28:22.784
(laughs)

28:22.909 --> 28:24.286
Yuko was
totally right.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.580
I thought she was trying
to ruin my show,

28:26.704 --> 28:29.166
but she was really just
trying to make it good.

28:29.291 --> 28:30.334
Do you see what

28:30.459 --> 28:32.085
I'm trying to say?
Yeah.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.254
That Kelly and I should try
walking in each other's shoes.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.298
Huh.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.217
That story works on two levels.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.760
Yeah, well, Kelly's shoes suck.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.309
(sighs softly)

28:51.021 --> 28:54.816
So, just, uh, give me a
shout when you're done,

28:54.941 --> 28:56.151
and I'll come
get you.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.361
I'm gonna explore.

28:57.486 --> 29:00.030
Sounds good.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.407
I'll...

29:05.327 --> 29:06.745
That's her.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.835
Go.

29:22.177 --> 29:23.387
I can't.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.474
Yes, you can.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.435
No. No.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.852
I-I can't.

29:30.977 --> 29:32.020
I can't.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.397
Thought I was ready

29:33.522 --> 29:35.274
to see her.

29:35.399 --> 29:36.442
But I'm not.

29:36.567 --> 29:37.776
It's still too painful.

29:41.071 --> 29:43.198
I wish I could go
apologize to her.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.827
But I'm just not ready yet.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.423
Excuse me.

29:59.548 --> 30:01.300
You are Dana Bowen, right?

30:01.425 --> 30:02.301
Yeah.

30:02.426 --> 30:03.343
I'm Annie.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.804
I'm Dixon's sister.

30:08.599 --> 30:10.309
My-my Dixon?

30:10.434 --> 30:12.269
Yeah.

30:12.394 --> 30:14.896
Um, we drove here

30:15.021 --> 30:16.356
so he could
see you.

30:16.482 --> 30:17.691
He wanted to tell
you something.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.360
But then he got too nervous,
so I said I would do it.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.654
Well, what?

30:21.779 --> 30:23.113
What-what did he want
to tell me?

30:23.238 --> 30:25.532
He wanted to apologize.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.454
What does he have
to apologize for?

30:30.579 --> 30:32.456
When he was eight,
a social worker asked him

30:32.581 --> 30:33.957
if he wanted to stay with you

30:34.082 --> 30:35.959
or get adopted.

30:36.084 --> 30:38.962
So, he wanted
to apologize

30:39.087 --> 30:40.547
for choosing to leave.

30:40.673 --> 30:43.091
He thought that was his choice?

30:43.216 --> 30:44.884
Yeah.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.515
He was an eight-year-old kid.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.766
I mean,
that social worker

30:50.890 --> 30:53.602
might have asked him,
but believe me,

30:53.727 --> 30:55.646
I made the decision.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.564
Because it was
what was best for him.

30:57.690 --> 31:01.443
Well, I will tell him that.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.612
Thank you.

31:03.737 --> 31:05.405
Wait.

31:05.531 --> 31:08.575
Can you stay a minute?

31:12.162 --> 31:14.206
Is he...

31:14.331 --> 31:16.291
Um...

31:16.416 --> 31:17.626
Is Dixon okay?

31:17.751 --> 31:19.961
Dixon's great.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.922
He's really great.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.133
How are you doing?

31:25.258 --> 31:26.552
Pretty good, you know.

31:26.677 --> 31:28.345
I got a job,
an apartment...

31:28.470 --> 31:30.556
I'm doing okay.

31:30.681 --> 31:33.851
He will be so glad to hear that.

31:33.975 --> 31:36.854
So, he finally got
himself a sister, huh?

31:36.978 --> 31:39.189
You know, growing up,
Dixon always wanted one.

31:39.314 --> 31:42.275
He used to beg me to buy him
a sister at the hospital.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.652
Oh, really?

31:43.777 --> 31:45.487
Oh, yeah.

31:45.612 --> 31:47.322
His little cousin, um,

31:47.447 --> 31:49.616
she left a little baby doll
at the house once.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.535
Well, Dixon said she left it,

31:51.660 --> 31:53.161
but I always thought
he stole it.

31:53.286 --> 31:54.872
(laughs)
He used to drag

31:54.996 --> 31:58.333
that doll around,
calling it his sister.

31:58.458 --> 31:59.459
Named her Mango.

31:59.585 --> 32:00.502
Mango?

32:00.627 --> 32:01.670
Mango.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.714
(laughs)

32:06.759 --> 32:08.385
ETHAN:
How much longer
till it kicks in?

32:08.510 --> 32:10.011
LIAM:
Any minute now.

32:10.136 --> 32:11.346
Here's what
Hunter Thompson taught me.

32:11.471 --> 32:14.140
Look at a fixed
point in the horizon

32:14.266 --> 32:16.685
and start taking
deep breaths.

32:16.810 --> 32:19.605
Faster. Oxygen helps
activate the mescaline.

32:19.730 --> 32:21.523
You should be
feeling it now.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.108
Empty your mind.

32:23.233 --> 32:25.444
Really empty it.

32:25.569 --> 32:26.612
(rustling nearby)

32:26.737 --> 32:28.196
Whoa...

32:31.241 --> 32:32.242
Check out that coyote.

32:37.122 --> 32:39.332
What coyote?

32:39.458 --> 32:40.375
There was just a...

32:40.500 --> 32:42.711
Look, there was just...

32:42.836 --> 32:46.298
Whoa, am I tripping?

32:46.423 --> 32:48.550
Right on.

32:48.675 --> 32:52.220
That wasn't a coyote.

32:52.345 --> 32:56.224
That was a peyote coyote.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.101
Cool.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.479
It's time to
close your eyes.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.107
Now...

33:04.232 --> 33:06.234
picture your own face.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.153
Okay.

33:08.278 --> 33:09.947
And go into the image
of your face

33:10.071 --> 33:12.574
till you're looking
into one of your eyes.

33:12.699 --> 33:15.494
Uh-huh. Okay.

33:15.619 --> 33:20.206
What is your expression
on the face within your face?

33:20.332 --> 33:22.417
I think I'm frowning.

33:25.879 --> 33:29.132
Whoa.
That's, uh, surprising.

33:29.257 --> 33:32.469
Yeah, that's... that's not
how people see me.

33:32.594 --> 33:33.679
But it's the face

33:33.804 --> 33:35.054
within the face.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.056
You know what
I'm saying?

33:37.182 --> 33:39.017
I think so.

33:39.142 --> 33:44.022
People think I'm someone
different than I am.

33:44.147 --> 33:47.442
Let me ask you something,
why do you smile?

33:47.567 --> 33:50.654
I smile...

33:53.031 --> 33:56.326
...'cause I don't want
to cause trouble for anyone.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.373
I don't want to make

34:01.498 --> 34:04.209
anyone's life harder.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.879
Not my teachers,

34:07.004 --> 34:09.297
not my coaches,
definitely not my parents.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.382
My brother's autistic,
so they need me to be easy,

34:11.507 --> 34:12.926
not make any waves.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.887
I don't want
to cause any conflicts,

34:15.012 --> 34:17.556
so I just pretend
like I'm fine.

34:17.681 --> 34:19.474
Even when I'm not.

34:21.309 --> 34:24.478
It's like a habit, I guess.

34:24.603 --> 34:26.356
But I'm tired of it.

34:26.481 --> 34:30.235
I'm tired of always
being the good guy.

34:33.612 --> 34:37.242
I'm tired of feeling
like a phony.

34:39.745 --> 34:43.289
(distant echoing howl)

34:43.415 --> 34:44.666
♪ ♪

34:44.791 --> 34:47.710
Okay, you are making

34:47.835 --> 34:49.462
Please. This dress is

Diablo Cody.
Nice to see you.
Looking fantastic.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.607
DIABLO: Hi! Nice
to see you, too!

35:08.732 --> 35:09.983
Is that...
Donna!

35:10.108 --> 35:11.693
...I have to ask you,
where's the Academy Award...

35:11.818 --> 35:13.779
Donna is on
the red carpet!
Oh!

35:13.904 --> 35:15.154
(cheering)

35:15.280 --> 35:17.032
Tell me a little bit
about your dress.

35:17.156 --> 35:18.533
Uh, this is a
Donna Martin.
Huh?

35:18.658 --> 35:20.410
Uh, yeah, actually, I have the
designer right here with me.

35:20.535 --> 35:21.995
(gasps)

35:22.120 --> 35:24.497
Donna, perfect, tell me a
little bit about your style.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.666
What...

35:26.792 --> 35:29.377
Hi, everybody.

35:29.502 --> 35:30.629
Sorry.

35:30.754 --> 35:31.797
(squealing)

35:31.922 --> 35:33.632

35:33.757 --> 35:35.884
Oh, my God.

35:36.009 --> 35:38.219
DIABLO:
You're actually not going to
believe this, but God knows...

35:38.344 --> 35:40.179
(laughing)

35:40.305 --> 35:41.598
(TV clicks off)

35:41.723 --> 35:43.809
We haven't laughed
like this in a while.

35:43.934 --> 35:46.394
Yeah.

35:46.519 --> 35:49.397
I know you think
I'm too strict,

35:49.522 --> 35:51.650
but we can't forget
what happened.

35:51.775 --> 35:53.652
And I don't!

35:53.777 --> 35:56.279
Believe me, I don't forget
about it for an instant.

35:56.404 --> 35:59.074
I have this to remind
me every day.

35:59.198 --> 36:03.829
But I don't want my whole life
to be about that.

36:06.790 --> 36:11.003
You know, Donna used to work
with this model named Yuko...

36:11.128 --> 36:14.339
Wait, she told you
that story, too?

36:14.464 --> 36:15.507
Yeah.

36:15.632 --> 36:16.716
All right, look,

36:16.842 --> 36:18.010
you were right
about the premiere.

36:18.135 --> 36:21.429
It would have been
too much for me.

36:21.554 --> 36:23.598
But I still need some
spontaneity in my life.

36:23.723 --> 36:26.267
Even if it's
just deciding to...

36:26.392 --> 36:28.603
put on a face masque
and bake some cookies,

36:28.728 --> 36:29.646
watch a horror movie.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.818
What do you say we put on a face
masque, bake some cookies?

36:34.943 --> 36:36.611
And watch a horror movie?

36:36.736 --> 36:38.655
Don't push it.

36:38.780 --> 36:41.366
(laughing)
Come on.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.788
Yeah. No more phoniness.
No more faking it.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.540
From now on,
if I'm upset about stuff,

36:48.665 --> 36:50.709
people are going to know it.
I'm-I'm talking a lot.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.585
Am I ruining your high?
Nah.

36:52.711 --> 36:56.297
It's pretty profound going
along with someone else's trip.

36:56.422 --> 36:58.216
I'm going to take a leak.

37:03.429 --> 37:05.849
(sighs) This stuff's delicious.

37:05.974 --> 37:07.475
(rustling)
(Liam yells)

37:07.600 --> 37:08.977
Damn!
Liam?

37:13.023 --> 37:14.733
Liam?

37:14.858 --> 37:16.860
I'm over here.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.740
(groaning)

37:21.865 --> 37:23.408
I jacked my ankle.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.744
Oh, man.
You look weird down there.

37:25.869 --> 37:29.330
Will you give me a hand?

37:29.455 --> 37:30.832
Sure.
No, no.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.250
Wait. That's what
the old Ethan

37:32.375 --> 37:34.669
would've done-- would've helped
out, been the good guy.

37:34.794 --> 37:36.838
What if this is some kind
of cosmic test?

37:36.963 --> 37:39.507
This isn't a cosmic test.
How do you know
it's not a cosmic test?

37:39.632 --> 37:41.509
Because you didn't take peyote,
jackass.

37:41.634 --> 37:43.678
What?
You worked all day
inhaling paint fumes,

37:43.803 --> 37:46.431
you had a few too many beers
and you drank some herb tea.

37:46.556 --> 37:48.474
You were screwing with me?

37:48.600 --> 37:52.311
Yeah. My bad.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.148
Now, can you get
me out of here?

38:05.575 --> 38:06.952
Thanks.

38:07.077 --> 38:08.369
(fists smacking)

38:08.494 --> 38:10.288
(groans)

38:18.588 --> 38:21.007
If you can't bring Mohammed
to the mountain...

38:21.133 --> 38:22.550
(screaming)

38:22.675 --> 38:23.593
Hi.

38:23.718 --> 38:25.929
Diablo Cody is in my house,

38:26.054 --> 38:28.014
and my face is
a crusty pukefest.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.933
I once knew a
stripper named
Crusty Pukefest.

38:30.058 --> 38:32.018
Oh, my God!
I love your dress.

38:32.144 --> 38:33.895
I love your movie.
I love your TV show.
Thank you.

38:34.020 --> 38:35.105
I love your blog!
I love your book!

38:35.230 --> 38:36.773
I love your hair!
Oh, my God, I love your hair.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.108
Then, you know,
we have to get a picture.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.525
Would you mind
doing the honors?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.777
DIABLO:
Awesome.
(squealing)

38:41.820 --> 38:43.446
Diablo Cody!

38:43.571 --> 38:44.489
Okay!

38:45.740 --> 38:47.242
(camera shutter snaps)

38:47.366 --> 38:50.162
Look, I tried to score
peyote and I couldn't.

38:50.287 --> 38:52.705
I messed with you because I
don't respond well to threats.

38:52.831 --> 38:53.790
And because
you're a douchebag.

38:53.915 --> 38:57.460
Okay, that, too.

38:57.585 --> 39:00.421
You wanted a self-revelation
and you got one.

39:00.546 --> 39:02.257
You just weren't high.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.425
Hallucinogens aren't all
they're cracked up to be.

39:04.550 --> 39:05.677
Oh, thanks, Dr. Drew.

39:05.802 --> 39:07.345
I'm serious.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.973
Last time I dropped acid,
I lost it and tried
to cut my arm off.

39:18.023 --> 39:19.482
I would have cut down
to the bone

39:19.607 --> 39:20.608
if my girl hadn't stopped me.

39:20.733 --> 39:23.444
Whoa, that's...
Crazy?

39:23.569 --> 39:25.113
No kidding.

39:25.238 --> 39:27.032
Now you know something
about me, okay?

39:27.157 --> 39:29.617
So we're even.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.911
I knew you were going to
punch me sooner or later.

39:32.037 --> 39:34.080
Go to hell.

39:34.206 --> 39:37.625
It's so nice having you here.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.003
Not to be selfish, but
sometimes it really sucks

39:40.128 --> 39:42.922
having my best friend live
halfway around the world.
Yeah.

39:43.048 --> 39:45.342
You know, I've actually
been toying with the idea

39:45.466 --> 39:47.052
of opening a store
in L.A... Who knows?

39:47.177 --> 39:50.013
Maybe L.A. is ready for
me now, hemp or no hemp.

39:50.138 --> 39:51.931
Oh, that would be amazing.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.432
Do you think David
would go for it?

39:59.231 --> 40:00.565
Donna, what's going on?

40:03.776 --> 40:05.737
David and I are separated.

40:11.201 --> 40:12.577
I'm sorry.

40:16.748 --> 40:20.626
(rock music plays)

40:20.752 --> 40:22.962
You have the worst
taste in music.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.714
Don't say that.
I am your Mango.

40:24.839 --> 40:27.050
I swear to you,
I do not remember

40:27.175 --> 40:28.551
anything about that doll.

40:28.676 --> 40:29.802
Oh, Mango thinks you do.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.137
(chuckling)

40:31.263 --> 40:32.805
(chuckling)

40:32.931 --> 40:34.599
Look, um...

40:34.724 --> 40:36.017
Thank you

40:36.142 --> 40:38.395
so much for
talking to her.

40:38.519 --> 40:40.646
You know,
'cause if you hadn't, um...

40:40.772 --> 40:42.065
I still would have
been feeling bad

40:42.190 --> 40:44.192
and really guilty.

40:44.317 --> 40:47.904
And next time,
when I am ready

40:48.029 --> 40:50.323
to talk to her...

40:50.448 --> 40:51.783
will you come back
with me again?

40:51.908 --> 40:54.077
Of course.

40:58.206 --> 40:59.457
Hey, you.

41:00.833 --> 41:03.086
I thought maybe you
could give me a ride.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.672
Your house
on the way to Ethan's?

41:06.798 --> 41:07.673
Excuse me?

41:09.008 --> 41:11.970
(indistinct conversation)

41:12.095 --> 41:13.096
You're giving him a ride?

41:14.973 --> 41:17.683
Forget it. I have my car
here, I just remembered.

41:19.518 --> 41:22.939
And I just remembered how
hot you were in the woods,

41:23.064 --> 41:25.108
so don't worry.

41:25.233 --> 41:26.734
You'll be getting
that ride very soon.
