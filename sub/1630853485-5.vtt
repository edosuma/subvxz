WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.080
The following programme
contains strong language.

00:10.680 --> 00:12.920
She had another bad dream.

00:12.960 --> 00:14.240
A woman has died here.

00:14.280 --> 00:16.480
You can't expect me to ignore that.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.880
What are you dreaming about, Nathan?
You can tell me.

00:18.920 --> 00:22.160
You have no authority
to speak to Nathan like that.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.320
Evie?

00:23.360 --> 00:26.400
You're a liar,
and you're not safe to live with.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.280
I wanna get out of this.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.000
We're going to find a way.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.000
ZOE:

00:37.920 --> 00:40.360
'In three years,

00:40.400 --> 00:42.800
our town has been taken over

00:42.840 --> 00:45.320
by a ruthless alien force.

00:48.120 --> 00:51.280
Now we live in fear and isolation.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.800
Cut off from the world.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.920
Strangers to each other

00:58.960 --> 01:00.800
and even to ourselves.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.520
We're told to stay silent.

01:02.560 --> 01:03.920
Tell no-one.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.800
Do nothing.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.720
Our every move is watched,

01:07.760 --> 01:10.200
our conversation monitored.

01:11.160 --> 01:13.920
It's like living under occupation,

01:13.960 --> 01:16.040
except for one thing.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.640
Our prison guards are children.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.280
For too long, we've been frightened
of admitting the truth.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.840
Frightened of what might happen
if we speak up.

01:36.880 --> 01:40.000
Frightened
of punishment and revenge.

01:40.040 --> 01:43.000
But I won't stay silent any more.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.120
I want this tarot to end.

01:45.160 --> 01:48.760
I want the world to know
what is happening in Midwich.'

01:49.760 --> 01:51.480
Morning, darling.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.480
Er...bad dreams again?

01:53.520 --> 01:54.840
What are you writing?

01:54.880 --> 01:57.680
Nothing. Come here.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.480
Hannah, are you coming?

02:27.520 --> 02:29.520
We'll be late for school.

02:29.560 --> 02:31.680
I'm just doing my teeth!

02:36.760 --> 02:38.720
I finished it.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.640
It's ready.

02:40.680 --> 02:42.480
Are you sure this is gonna work,
Zoe?

02:42.520 --> 02:44.320
It has to.

02:47.160 --> 02:49.800
..downpours. Heavy showers
developing quite widely,

02:49.840 --> 02:51.640
and some of those showers
turning into

02:51.680 --> 02:54.560
slow-moving intense thunderstorms.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.600
So there are warnings in place.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.960
Not everywhere is going to see
the thunderstorms,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.160
but where they do occur...

03:59.800 --> 04:02.800
GERALDINE:
So, Rachel, tell me about your week.

04:02.840 --> 04:04.520
Anything you want to share?

04:04.560 --> 04:06.440
It's been much better.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.760
Joe's really made an effort
with his brother,

04:08.800 --> 04:10.760
since that whole incident.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.040
They all have.
I agree.

04:13.080 --> 04:15.840
Sunny's been amazing
and Stewart's besotted.

04:15.880 --> 04:18.560
And your husband?

04:18.600 --> 04:20.880
Curtis is Curtis.

04:20.920 --> 04:23.720
I married him. I love him.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.640
There were always
gonna be bumps in the road.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.880
You just have to stay strong

04:28.920 --> 04:30.440
and be who you are.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.480
You were right.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.680
I am trouble.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.320
Has anyone else
got anything to share?

04:56.360 --> 04:59.320
Cassie?
Want to share anything with us?

04:59.360 --> 05:02.080
I'm fine, thanks, Geraldine.

05:02.120 --> 05:04.840
I realise that
this must be difficult for you.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.280
A few weeks ago, your mother
was sitting in this chair.

05:07.320 --> 05:08.920
When you're ready to talk
about that,

05:08.960 --> 05:11.480
we're here to listen.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.600
I said I'm fine.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.080
I think Cassie just needs some time,
Geraldine.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.840
Wimbledon have given me
a toxicology report

05:24.880 --> 05:26.600
on Amrita Chohhan.

05:26.640 --> 05:28.880
She was three times
over the driving limit.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.440
We checked with the hotel.

05:30.480 --> 05:33.040
It seems that,
after dropping the kid off,

05:33.080 --> 05:35.600
she went back to her room,
emptied the minibar,

05:35.640 --> 05:37.320
tried to drive off in a stupor,

05:37.360 --> 05:39.360
and ended up in the wrong vehicle.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.720
A tragedy, but -

05:41.760 --> 05:44.120
as I understand it -
an isolated event.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.600
How are things among the children?

05:47.640 --> 05:49.880
Not a single incident
since that day.

05:49.920 --> 05:53.160
Well, then,
onward, Christian soldiers.

05:53.200 --> 05:58.120
And let's keep Dr Zellaby's active
imagination out of things for now.

06:04.760 --> 06:06.200
What's wrong with him?

06:06.240 --> 06:08.240
Personal issues?

06:10.040 --> 06:12.040
What is that?

06:13.720 --> 06:17.160
Zoe Moran gave it to me
in the car park on my way in.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.840
She's threatening to publish it.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.640
She wants a meeting.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.640
'Hi, this is Cassie.

06:46.680 --> 06:49.040
If you really must,
leave a message.'

06:53.160 --> 06:55.640
How was your day?
It was fun.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.200
We did drawing and singing.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.520
Mr Clyde is such a bad singer.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.080
Mummy, this way.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.360
We're in the new house now.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.520
And I like it SO much more.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.120
Hey, what's the matter?

07:25.160 --> 07:26.800
He's sulking.

07:26.840 --> 07:29.400
It's about this.
It looks silly.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.120
You don't look like a mummy.

07:31.160 --> 07:33.760
Well, you don't get a choice
in my wardrobe, sunshine.

07:33.800 --> 07:36.000
He'll just have to get used to it,
won't he?

07:36.040 --> 07:37.640
Yeah, sure.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.560
I won't get used to it.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.720
Hey.

08:09.760 --> 08:11.760
Hey.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.720
He's finally asleep.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.560
When do you think
we should tell him?

08:22.600 --> 08:24.600
He'll probably sense it anyway.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.520
Can we wait a while?

08:33.800 --> 08:35.800
Why did you put that back in?

08:36.880 --> 08:40.320
Maybe I want you
to know who you're kissing.

09:10.840 --> 09:12.840
Sam, look, they want a meeting.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.840
Dad, we should go.
Yeah, coming now.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.600
Come on, let's go.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.720
Bye, Mummy.
ZOE: Bye.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.280
Hi.
SARAH: Oh, how are you?

09:43.320 --> 09:45.160
Oh, good, thanks.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.360
Well, you don't come
to the meetings, ever.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.760
We miss you.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.280
Yeah, oh, erm, sorry,
I've just been so busy.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.160
Whatever it is that's worrying you,

09:54.200 --> 09:56.680
I think it would help,
if you shared it.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.720
We're all in this together.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.640
OK. I will.
Great.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.680
Next week?
Next week.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.680
Jodie!

10:24.320 --> 10:25.960
It was Nathan.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.880
He did it.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.680
He made... He made me do it.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.600
What did you do?
I just made her Mummy again.

10:35.640 --> 10:37.960
It's what you want.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
Don't tell me what I want!

10:44.880 --> 10:48.800
It's true!
It's what he wants. It's true.

11:09.280 --> 11:12.200
You write well.
Well, I wrote it with a purpose.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.000
You want to leave?
Yes.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.360
The children will let me,
but not Sam.

11:17.400 --> 11:19.880
They've shifted
their control on to him.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.200
Their love,
if that's what you want to call it.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.240
So Sam wants to leave too?

11:24.280 --> 11:25.640
Yes.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.360
Are you sure about that?

11:27.400 --> 11:29.280
Yes.

11:29.320 --> 11:32.120
And he can, with your help.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.200
What do you mean "our help"?

11:35.240 --> 11:37.560
Stop them from coming after us.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.680
Arrange for Hannah
to live with someone else

11:40.720 --> 11:42.440
to help her forget us.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.160
I have to remind you, Zoe,

11:44.200 --> 11:46.120
you did sign
the Official Secrets Act.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.480
Are you going to arrest me?

11:49.520 --> 11:52.880
Because I have another copy
of what I wrote in my possession,

11:52.920 --> 11:54.600
should I need it.

12:00.440 --> 12:02.520
And if we agree to help you?

12:02.560 --> 12:04.720
I will destroy everything I wrote.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.880
I just want out,

12:07.920 --> 12:09.680
safely, without Hannah,

12:09.720 --> 12:11.520
without punishment.

12:11.560 --> 12:16.840
And I promise you, you will never
hear from either of us ever again.

12:22.840 --> 12:24.800
If you're here to check on me,
don't bother.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.640
I'm not going anywhere.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.920
It's about Amrita Chohhan.
I tried calling.

12:28.960 --> 12:32.120
I don't want to talk to you, and
I've been barred from the project.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.160
She's dead.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.760
Wasn't expecting visitors.

12:48.800 --> 12:50.800
I need your help.
No-one knows I'm here.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.520
Tell me.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.720
We found her body,

12:54.760 --> 12:57.040
frozen to death in a freezer van.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.760
When?

12:58.800 --> 13:00.680
Just over two weeks now.

13:00.720 --> 13:02.480
Why didn't you say something?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.960
I had orders from above.

13:05.000 --> 13:07.360
They're trying
to make it look like a suicide.

13:08.360 --> 13:09.760
But it's not.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.400
Well, how do you know?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.840
Has Nathan done something?

13:22.440 --> 13:23.920
I...

13:23.960 --> 13:25.960
I told Amrita she'd be safe here.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.640
It's not your fault.

13:27.680 --> 13:29.840
I should have listened to you
a long time ago.

13:29.880 --> 13:32.800
But if there is anything
you can tell me,

13:32.840 --> 13:34.800
anything you know...

13:41.200 --> 13:43.520
Mr Clyde.
Yes, Connor.

13:43.560 --> 13:47.120
Who decided that plants
would make the air we breathe?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.440
Well,
that depends on what you believe.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.520
We think it was the plants' idea.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.560
So we wouldn't kill them.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.400
Olive, careful!

14:17.440 --> 14:19.120
You don't ever touch those.

14:19.160 --> 14:20.960
These berries are highly poisonous.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.680
Has everyone got that?

14:22.720 --> 14:25.080
Yes, Mr Clyde.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.120
All right, let's carry on.

14:48.200 --> 14:50.800
MARY-ANN:
Don't forget to walk in backwards.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.840
Apparently, it's Midwich good luck.

14:52.880 --> 14:55.520
I give you your happiness.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.360
TAPE:
Did Sunny's mummy make you angry?

15:15.400 --> 15:17.760
'Did you hurt her?'

15:17.800 --> 15:19.680
'NATHAN: It was her fault.'

15:19.720 --> 15:21.880
'Why was it her fault?

15:21.920 --> 15:23.960
Because
she wanted to take Sunny away?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.960
What are you dreaming about,
Nathan?'

15:26.000 --> 15:29.520
'Stop it!'
''

15:29.560 --> 15:32.320
'Oi!'
What's he saying?

15:32.360 --> 15:35.400
That's what I was trying to find
out, when you sent me into exile.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.480
Yesterday, someone sent me this.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.600
I searched "Nordosk",

15:43.640 --> 15:45.640
but nothing came up.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.640
Who would send me that?

15:51.880 --> 15:54.080
Can I take the recording with me?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.840
You can trust me.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.880
Please.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.040
I have an investment in this too.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.120
Yeah, OK.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.720
Paul...

16:13.560 --> 16:16.320
You told Cassie about
what happened between me and her,

16:16.360 --> 16:18.360
when she was little.

16:19.280 --> 16:21.880
I hid it from her

16:21.920 --> 16:23.920
all these years and...

16:25.920 --> 16:27.920
..I shouldn't have.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.120
You should talk to her.

16:42.120 --> 16:45.360
Steve, I need an audio cleaned up...

16:45.400 --> 16:47.720
on the quiet...now.

16:47.760 --> 16:49.480
It's Friday night, boss.

16:49.520 --> 16:52.400
I don't care.
We stay as long as it takes.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.640
Back!

16:56.680 --> 16:59.280
Mummy, there's a picnic tomorrow.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.320
Can we go?

17:02.280 --> 17:04.280
Mummy?

17:15.800 --> 17:18.720
Mummy, let me in. I need a wee.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.640
In a minute.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.680
Mummy!
In a minute!

17:31.320 --> 17:33.120
'What are you dreaming about,
Nathan?'

17:33.160 --> 17:35.720
'Stop it!'
''

17:35.760 --> 17:37.920
Can you take out that bass hum?

17:37.960 --> 17:39.640
'Tell me about your dreams.'

17:39.680 --> 17:44.080
''

17:44.120 --> 17:47.440
'Pojalista! Pojalista!'

17:47.480 --> 17:50.400
Sounds like Russian.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.280
''

17:52.320 --> 17:55.600
What the hell's that?

17:55.640 --> 17:57.640
'CHILD: Nordosk.'

17:59.280 --> 18:02.480
This is going to work, Sam. All
the children will be at the picnic.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.160
You take Hannah,
but then when I text you,

18:05.200 --> 18:07.440
you find a reason to slip away.
Leave the rest to me.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.360
The children will stop us.
They won't know.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.920
Just make sure you leave
when I tell you to, OK?

18:14.880 --> 18:16.480
And, Sam,

18:16.520 --> 18:19.320
you cannot say anything to Hannah.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.080
No goodbyes.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.000
Nothing, not a word.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.400
Are you coming to the picnic?
I think we will.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.040
I don't know how you cope
with that man of yours.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.880
It's not right
the way he treats you.

18:44.920 --> 18:46.680
You know how it is...

18:46.720 --> 18:48.760
when you love someone.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.160
No, I don't remember.

18:52.200 --> 18:54.520
When did you last have a...?

18:54.560 --> 18:56.280
Do you say "girlfriend"?

18:56.320 --> 18:58.320
I say "partner".
RACHEL: Partner?

18:58.360 --> 19:00.520
Not since this started.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.560
But I have Connor.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.600
It's true.

19:05.560 --> 19:09.480
What I feel when I'm with Joe,
it's...

19:09.520 --> 19:11.240
Better than sex?

19:18.480 --> 19:20.200
Are you going to work?

19:20.240 --> 19:22.320
Yeah, I have to.
Something's come up.

19:22.360 --> 19:24.320
But he'll be upset.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.600
Mum, let's go!

19:26.640 --> 19:29.440
Can you at least
try to come home early?

19:29.480 --> 19:31.800
I don't want to be alone with him.

19:31.840 --> 19:33.840
I promise.

19:42.040 --> 19:44.920
I wanted to take David
fishing this afternoon.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.600
It's just a picnic, Curtis!

19:46.640 --> 19:49.480
Yeah, but why do we always
have to do everything with them?

19:49.520 --> 19:52.320
Because they like to be together.
That's how it works.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.720
Daddy, can we take
chocolate fingers to the picnic?

20:03.760 --> 20:05.480
Yeah. I'll look in a minute.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.560
I'm not going to come today, Hannah.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.520
I'm just suddenly
not feeling so good.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.480
You go with Daddy. Is that OK?

20:16.040 --> 20:18.040
I'll get my bag.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.920
'Hi, this is Ryan. Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.'

20:51.960 --> 20:53.640
''
Yeah, Ryan, it's me.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.680
You were supposed to come yesterday,

20:55.720 --> 20:58.120
and I've run out
and I really fucking need it.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.920
Mum, there are no clean plates!

21:00.960 --> 21:02.680
Yeah, in a minute.

21:09.280 --> 21:12.200
Come now.

21:12.240 --> 21:14.720
Oh, wait. Wait, wait. I'll get it.

21:14.760 --> 21:17.120
It's just one of my friends
dropping something off.

21:17.160 --> 21:20.520
Can you go and get the rest of your
stuff ready, OK? I'll be one minute.

21:28.160 --> 21:29.680
About fucking time.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.040
What are you doing here?
I tried to call.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.160
You're not allowed anywhere near us.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.960
Please, Cassie, can we have
a coffee? I need to explain.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.240
We're already running really late.
I can't.

21:40.280 --> 21:42.320
Who...who did that?

21:42.360 --> 21:44.120
Who hurt you?

21:44.160 --> 21:46.200
I have to go right now.

21:46.240 --> 21:48.720
Look, Cassie,
ask Nora to take Evie, OK?

21:48.760 --> 21:51.440
Tell them
you'll see them there later.

21:52.720 --> 21:54.400
OK, fine, but Evie can't see you.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.440
OK.

21:59.600 --> 22:02.520
I've got a plate and a mug.
NORA: That's so cool.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.960
Daddy?
Yeah.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.800
I think there's something
you're not telling me.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.680
What am I not telling you, darling?

22:22.320 --> 22:24.600
You're such a bad liar, Daddy.

22:32.120 --> 22:34.520
Hey, Carol. How's George's back?
Much better.

22:34.560 --> 22:36.880
Just an excuse
not to do any housework, I reckon!

22:36.920 --> 22:38.920
Don't fall for it.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.520
Carol, erm...

22:41.560 --> 22:43.640
Miss Cummings in?
In her office.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.800
Do me a favour,
don't let her know I'm here.

22:45.840 --> 22:47.840
She'll have me
working all bloody weekend!

22:56.560 --> 22:58.560
This afternoon, yes.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.920
I don't know how the others
are gonna take it when they're gone.

23:01.960 --> 23:03.960
OK. Yeah.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.320
Do you want to have tea?

23:07.360 --> 23:09.760
Yeah. Yeah, that would be nice.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.440
If you can find a mug.

23:13.480 --> 23:14.960
Yeah. I've been a bit busy.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.720
I'm joking.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.760
You should see my place.

23:22.040 --> 23:25.400
What happened...with Evie?
Why did she hurt you?

23:26.320 --> 23:28.000
She didn't.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.600
Please don't lie to me.

23:38.520 --> 23:41.800
Rory's game today
is Grandmother's Footsteps.

23:41.840 --> 23:44.160
Who knows how to play that?
CHILDREN: ME!

23:44.200 --> 23:46.160
Hi.
No Zoe?

23:46.200 --> 23:49.320
She's not feeling very well.
Oh, that's a shame.

23:49.360 --> 23:52.120
Can I go and play?
Yeah, of course.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.160
Always in charge of everything!

23:55.200 --> 23:57.960
If I see anyone moving,
which I shall,

23:58.000 --> 24:00.120
you have to go back to
the beginning and start again.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.840
Look, before we begin,

24:01.880 --> 24:04.840
I want you to separate
two things in your mind.

24:04.880 --> 24:06.560
If we're gonna fucking do this,

24:06.600 --> 24:09.920
can you try and sound like my
mother, and not a fucking doctor?

24:11.240 --> 24:13.880
OK. Sorry.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.800
Did no-one move?
We did move.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.280
You just didn't see us.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.440
No.

24:23.480 --> 24:25.280
No, I...didn't.

24:25.320 --> 24:27.240
Oh, hi, Evie. You made it.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.400
Where's Cassie?
NORA: Oh, she's coming later.

24:29.440 --> 24:32.440
I think she's tired.
SARAH: It's all her mother's fault.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.160
I mean, it must be so upsetting.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.200
Oh, this is heaven!

24:39.080 --> 24:41.080
Hey, focus!

25:12.960 --> 25:15.680
I lied to you about
what happened when you were young.

25:15.720 --> 25:18.240
I should have told you
the trouble I'd had.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.560
I tried.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.800
But I didn't want you
to ever feel that you'd been...

25:26.840 --> 25:28.840
Unloved?

25:33.440 --> 25:35.320
Go on.

25:36.480 --> 25:39.400
I knew within weeks of having you
that something was wrong.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.560
I was...I was working too hard.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.440
There was no-one there to help,
you know?

25:48.480 --> 25:50.520
Your dad had left.

25:50.560 --> 25:52.960
My mother was impossible.

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
It built up.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.920
And...

25:58.840 --> 26:02.200
And I wasn't thinking straight,
Cassie.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.600
And I..

26:06.640 --> 26:08.600
I became scared...

26:09.560 --> 26:11.240
..of you,

26:11.280 --> 26:12.960
of myself

26:13.000 --> 26:14.520
and...

26:14.560 --> 26:16.560
of what I might do.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.880
And I gave you up.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.240
Only for a little while.

26:26.240 --> 26:28.560
How long?

26:31.320 --> 26:33.560
A year.

26:36.000 --> 26:38.640
To foster parents.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.960
They were nice people.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.120
They had the option

26:43.160 --> 26:45.160
to adopt you.

26:46.720 --> 26:48.840
But then I...I got help

26:48.880 --> 26:53.360
and I started to feel so much better

26:53.400 --> 26:55.640
and I...I missed you.

26:55.680 --> 26:57.680
I missed you so much.

26:57.720 --> 26:59.720
And I got you back.

27:02.440 --> 27:04.760
Why didn't you tell me that?

27:05.720 --> 27:07.760
Because I was ashamed.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.840
But if I was unwell then,

27:11.880 --> 27:14.960
I swear, I'm not now.

27:16.360 --> 27:19.320
Something is really, really wrong.

27:30.160 --> 27:33.440
MARY-ANN: You OK?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fine.

27:33.480 --> 27:34.840
Have some food.

27:34.880 --> 27:36.400
No, I'm not hungry, thanks.

27:38.480 --> 27:42.840
Mummy, can we go for a walk
in the woods?

27:42.880 --> 27:45.440
OK, but not too far.

27:45.480 --> 27:47.920
We won't go outside
the edge of town.

27:47.960 --> 27:50.320
MARY-ANN: Well, that we know.
OLIVE: Back soon!

27:51.680 --> 27:54.360
Love you.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.840
Actually, I think
I'm gonna go and check on Zoe.

27:59.880 --> 28:02.160
But you've only just got here.
Yeah, sorry.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.360
Save me some cake.
I'll be back soon.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.920
MARY-ANN: What's wrong with him?

28:06.960 --> 28:08.640
It's that wife of his.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.160
She's got him right here.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.680
Girlfriend. They're not married.

28:20.720 --> 28:23.200
SUSANNAH:
The children are controlling you.

28:24.080 --> 28:27.480
You love them, you protect them...

28:27.520 --> 28:29.480
and normally that's enough for them.

28:29.520 --> 28:32.000
But when you turn against them,
they react.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.480
Look at you - you're exhausted.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.240
It's normal to be tired.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.960
No, not like this.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.800
This is not normal.

28:40.840 --> 28:42.840
Evie is punishing you

28:42.880 --> 28:45.080
for every mistake,
every wrong decision.

28:45.120 --> 28:48.000
Only when I deserve it.

28:48.040 --> 28:51.680
Cassie, darling, listen to yourself.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.040
Amrita Chohhan is dead.

28:56.880 --> 28:59.480
The children were behind it.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.640
No.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.680
Yes.

29:02.720 --> 29:05.000
And I have a feeling

29:05.040 --> 29:07.720
they might harm someone else
at any moment.

29:07.760 --> 29:10.400
Maybe one of the mothers.
Maybe even you.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.280
You're lying.

29:12.320 --> 29:15.120
That doesn't lie.

29:15.160 --> 29:17.600
The children behave
the way they do for a reason.

29:17.640 --> 29:21.000
If I can understand why,

29:21.040 --> 29:22.800
then I believe I can change them.

29:22.840 --> 29:25.920
But you have to help me
make them listen.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.320
Where are they?

29:27.360 --> 29:30.360
Stewart, go and find them!
Why me?

29:30.400 --> 29:33.000
Curtis!
JANE: Connor?

29:33.040 --> 29:36.880
Mummy, I'm here!
JANE: Connor, where are you?

29:36.920 --> 29:38.920
OK, I'm coming now.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.720
I think she knows.
I think they all do.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.480
Sam, this is our chance.

30:06.520 --> 30:08.520
We need to leave now. Come on.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.000
I saw it. I saw it in their eyes.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.840
I turned around -
they were looking at me.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.560
Sam, I did it yesterday.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.840
I didn't want to tell you because
I don't even know if it's real.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.680
But it's yours.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.560
So we have to go.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.600
We have to leave now.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.800
Go on.
OK.

30:49.960 --> 30:52.480
Hello, Paul. It's me.

30:52.520 --> 30:55.360
I'm just wondering
if you're coming home for dinner.

30:59.280 --> 31:01.040
I'm sorry, Mummy.

31:02.200 --> 31:04.200
For hurting you.

31:04.240 --> 31:06.240
It's OK.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.360
You're beautiful.

31:11.680 --> 31:13.680
Thank you.

31:16.080 --> 31:17.800
So are you.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.480
This one's ready to go.
Yeah.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.200
I'll just be a minute.
All right.

32:06.480 --> 32:09.000
How was it?
It was fun.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.280
We played games.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.760
Then we ran in the woods.

32:14.640 --> 32:16.800
Well, I'm sorry I missed it.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.200
You had a sleep.

32:25.040 --> 32:27.600
No, actually, erm...

32:27.640 --> 32:30.320
Granny came to see me.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.400
She shouldn't have!

32:33.440 --> 32:35.200
She's not allowed to.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.560
She needs to talk to you, Evie.

32:40.240 --> 32:42.280
Evie, don't.

32:42.320 --> 32:45.080
It's me you want to hurt.
Why are you here?

32:45.120 --> 32:48.400
Because I want to help you.
You want to get in the way again.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.440
But you can't stop it.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.480
It's too late.

32:54.640 --> 32:56.320
What's too late to stop?

33:10.640 --> 33:12.120
Sam! Can you come here?

33:12.160 --> 33:14.160
Yeah. Just a minute.

33:43.400 --> 33:45.680
Who's there?

34:27.920 --> 34:29.960
Please...no.

34:34.040 --> 34:36.040
Sam?

34:44.400 --> 34:46.400
Sam, where are you?

35:04.440 --> 35:07.040
Evie, are you planning
to hurt someone,

35:07.080 --> 35:09.240
like you did with Amrita? Who?

35:09.280 --> 35:11.520
Please, tell me who.

35:11.560 --> 35:14.200
The one that doesn't love us.

35:14.240 --> 35:16.800
Zoe Moran?

35:16.840 --> 35:19.200
What is it that Zoe's trying to do?

35:19.240 --> 35:20.920
She's trying to take him away.

35:20.960 --> 35:22.680
Trying to take who away?

35:22.720 --> 35:24.240
Hannah's daddy.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.960
She has to be stopped.

35:26.000 --> 35:28.000
Is this happening now?

35:31.600 --> 35:33.480
Evie...

35:33.520 --> 35:35.320
Evie, please,

35:35.360 --> 35:37.560
before you do anything,
just talk to me.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.600
Tell me about Nordosk.

35:50.120 --> 35:52.120
What are you doing?

35:52.160 --> 35:54.680
What is this?

35:54.720 --> 35:56.840
Give me that file now, please.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.760
You lied to me.

35:58.800 --> 36:01.400
You knew they came before.

36:01.440 --> 36:02.880
A group of children...

36:02.920 --> 36:04.480
all born on the same day.

36:04.520 --> 36:06.120
Russia, 1973.

36:06.160 --> 36:07.800
None survived.

36:07.840 --> 36:09.800
You know exactly
what happened to them.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.720
Paul, I'm warning you.

36:13.080 --> 36:14.880
You killed that woman,

36:14.920 --> 36:16.640
made me cover up for you.

36:16.680 --> 36:19.320
You deliberately got me

36:19.360 --> 36:21.360
to discredit Susannah Zellaby

36:21.400 --> 36:24.040
and you played on
my emotional allegiance to Nathan.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.200
You played me like a fucking pipe.

36:26.240 --> 36:29.520
I had no choice.
I was following orders.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.120
I trusted you.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.400
Yeah.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.400
OK.

36:41.440 --> 36:43.440
I'm on my way.

36:45.280 --> 36:47.400
Cassie thinks Zoe Moran's in danger.

36:47.440 --> 36:50.160
Zoe's trying to leave
without the children knowing.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.400
Well, they do know,
and they're gonna stop her.

36:54.920 --> 36:56.920
You call Westcott,

36:56.960 --> 36:59.840
and you tell him
I want to know everything.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.920
Fuck.

37:03.960 --> 37:06.760
Nordosk is a place, isn't it?

37:06.800 --> 37:08.480
Somewhere you were before.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.400
We thought we would be welcome.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.440
But you weren't.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.400
What happened?

37:17.480 --> 37:20.560
You killed us, in the cold.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
You were going to leave...

37:36.640 --> 37:38.960
..and take Daddy with you.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.120
And the baby.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.600
That can't happen.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.200
I'm still full from the picnic.
Can I go to bed, please, Mummy?

37:59.240 --> 38:01.240
Oh.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.280
Yeah, all right.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.080
Good night.

38:05.120 --> 38:06.800
Night.

38:09.160 --> 38:11.160
I'll be up in a minute, OK?

38:22.480 --> 38:24.040
Paul?

38:32.200 --> 38:33.880
Nathan?

38:34.920 --> 38:37.400
We chose this world as our home.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.400
We wanted to be human like you.

38:40.440 --> 38:44.080
But you didn't want us here.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.720
You thought we were a danger.

38:46.760 --> 38:49.360
Show me.

38:49.400 --> 38:51.400
Show me how we killed you.

38:54.080 --> 38:56.280
You locked us in our schoolroom.

38:56.320 --> 38:58.360
You said it was for lessons.

38:59.520 --> 39:02.040
You all left the town.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.080
We couldn't get out.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.400
Then the planes came.

39:09.480 --> 39:12.080
We're locked in! We're locked in!

39:44.800 --> 39:47.880
Dad, you shouldn't be here.

39:47.920 --> 39:50.200
Nathan, what are you doing?

39:50.240 --> 39:52.240
You need to leave.

39:56.480 --> 39:58.240
Nathan...

40:12.800 --> 40:14.800
We burnt alive.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.640
We screamed, but no-one heard.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.800
You tricked us.

40:18.840 --> 40:21.520
This time we won't let you do that.

40:21.560 --> 40:23.560
This time we are stronger than you.

40:23.600 --> 40:25.600
This time we WILL defend ourselves.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.840
Wait. Listen to me.

40:39.480 --> 40:42.120
We don't want to do that to you.

40:43.040 --> 40:44.840
You are loved here.

40:44.880 --> 40:46.880
You don't love us.

40:46.920 --> 40:48.920
You think we're bad.
No.

40:48.960 --> 40:51.360
No, we don't think you're bad.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.160
We can live together.

40:53.200 --> 40:55.160
You can live here with us.

40:55.200 --> 40:57.200
But not if you hurt Zoe.

40:57.240 --> 40:59.480
Then everything changes.

41:05.080 --> 41:07.080
And if we agree,

41:07.120 --> 41:09.120
then will you love us?

41:12.040 --> 41:13.880
I swear it.

41:13.920 --> 41:16.360
And if anything goes wrong...

41:19.080 --> 41:21.080
Then I will bear the blame.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.280
Hello, Daddy.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.320
I'm going to have a little sister.

42:23.960 --> 42:26.440
A promise is forever, Granny.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.120
# Cuckoo, cuckoo!

42:38.040 --> 42:40.720
# In April

42:40.760 --> 42:43.360
# I open my bill

42:43.400 --> 42:46.040
# In May

42:46.080 --> 42:48.560
# I sing night and day

42:48.600 --> 42:51.200
# In June

42:51.240 --> 42:53.840
# I change my tune

42:53.880 --> 42:56.640
# In July

42:56.680 --> 42:59.360
# How far I fly

42:59.400 --> 43:01.880
# In August

43:01.920 --> 43:05.680
# Away...

43:12.560 --> 43:16.280
# Away...

43:21.160 --> 43:24.920
# Away... #

43:32.320 --> 43:34.320
