WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:04.338
TERESA: Previously,
on "Queen of the South"...

00:04.372 --> 00:06.174
I have a new job now.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.508
As soon as I make enough money,
I'll come for you,

00:07.541 --> 00:08.676
and we're gonna
move in together.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.344
Why are you doing this for me?

00:10.378 --> 00:11.845
It's to help Tony,
get him someplace safe.

00:11.879 --> 00:14.248
(sirens blaring)

00:14.282 --> 00:16.817
Camila Vargas,
you're under arrest.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.519
JAMES: You remember Denny,

00:18.552 --> 00:20.188
our man in
the sheriff's department.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.322
DENNY: I can't stop
thinking about

00:21.355 --> 00:22.590
the other night, and...

00:22.623 --> 00:23.857
I'm at the Willow Street house.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.259
Give me an hour.

00:25.293 --> 00:26.694
She's on her way.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.029
Good. She'll give us
what we need.

00:29.063 --> 00:30.831
KELLY ANNE:
Teresa, it's Kelly Anne.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.766
You need to come to my house
as soon as you can.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.368
These are the ownership
documents filed

00:34.402 --> 00:35.903
for Camila's trawler company.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.105
TERESA:
I never signed these papers.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.772
This has to be fake.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.609
She found paperwork
on some of your companies

00:41.642 --> 00:42.743
in Cole's office.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.044
I would never lie to you.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.546
Let's talk turkey.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.615
Figure a way out
for all parties involved.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.550
(gunshot)

00:49.583 --> 00:51.252
*

00:52.753 --> 00:55.756
(dramatic music)

00:55.789 --> 01:01.562
*

01:01.595 --> 01:03.231
(horn honking)

01:03.264 --> 01:04.398
KELLY ANNE: Teresa, look out!

01:04.432 --> 01:05.499
(tires screech)

01:13.841 --> 01:16.043
(gasping)

01:16.076 --> 01:17.611
Are you okay?

01:17.645 --> 01:19.280
Yeah, peachy,

01:19.313 --> 01:21.081
considering you almost
just turned me into

01:21.115 --> 01:23.151
a little blonde splat
on that guy's windshield.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.219
I'm sorry.
I must have dozed off.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.787
No, it's okay--listen,
we've been driving all night.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.222
We should rest.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.757
We can't. We have
a meeting to get to.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.759
(siren blaring)

01:31.792 --> 01:34.162
KELLY ANNE: Oh, shit.

01:34.195 --> 01:35.463
Shit. What do we do?

01:35.496 --> 01:38.299
Just stay calm.
Give me the gun.

01:38.332 --> 01:45.306
*

01:45.339 --> 01:47.508
What if he knows about Cole?

01:48.976 --> 01:55.983
*

02:00.120 --> 02:01.455
You ladies all right?

02:01.489 --> 02:04.091
Saw you swerving back there.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.394
Yeah, I must have
dozed off, sorry.

02:07.395 --> 02:08.596
Been drinking?

02:08.629 --> 02:10.198
No, I'm just really tired.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.999
I've been driving for hours.

02:12.032 --> 02:13.767
*

02:13.801 --> 02:15.669
See your license
and registration?

02:15.703 --> 02:16.537
Sure.

02:17.871 --> 02:24.878
*

02:26.814 --> 02:28.182
Step out of the car, please.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.786
Step out of the car, now.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.555
Wait, no, no, no,
Officer.

02:34.588 --> 02:37.157
This is my fault, okay?

02:37.191 --> 02:39.627
My father passed away,
and we were driving down

02:39.660 --> 02:41.629
to Odessa to make
the arrangements,

02:41.662 --> 02:45.633
and I was too devastated
to drive, and she graciously

02:45.666 --> 02:48.001
offered to drive even though
she's been working all night,

02:48.035 --> 02:51.705
so if you have to give anybody
a ticket, please, give it to me.

02:51.739 --> 02:58.746
*

03:05.419 --> 03:07.355
OFFICER: I'm gonna
let you go with a warning.

03:07.388 --> 03:11.425
If you find yourself getting
tired again, you pull over.

03:11.459 --> 03:12.760
Thank you.

03:12.793 --> 03:19.800
*

03:30.210 --> 03:32.012
Cole Van Awken didn't
show up for work today.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.080
No one can get ahold of him.

03:33.113 --> 03:34.582
Camila's sitting in jail,

03:34.615 --> 03:36.284
and her lead attorney
just disappears?

03:36.317 --> 03:38.619
You think he knows Kelly Anne's
working with us?

03:39.653 --> 03:41.789
Him...
or Camila?

03:42.790 --> 03:44.091
Let's put out a BOLO.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.294
(scoffs)
My guess is,

03:46.327 --> 03:48.095
we're never gonna see
either one of them again.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.131
Okay.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.571
(thunder rumbling)

03:57.605 --> 03:59.973
Okay, listen.

04:01.174 --> 04:02.710
Keep the car running.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.111
If anything goes wrong,
you get out of here

04:04.144 --> 04:06.580
and call Pote, understand?

04:06.614 --> 04:07.581
You sure about this?

04:07.615 --> 04:08.916
There's no other way.

04:10.418 --> 04:13.387
(dramatic music)

04:13.421 --> 04:19.960
*

04:19.993 --> 04:21.395
Is that Cole's wife?

04:21.429 --> 04:24.264
*

04:24.298 --> 04:26.334
We've been trying to get
ahold of you for hours.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.670
I'm getting out.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.472
What are you talking about?

04:31.505 --> 04:34.442
I'm leaving Dallas
and the business for good.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.644
If this is about
our disagreement...

04:36.677 --> 04:38.412
It has nothing to do with you.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.614
*

04:40.648 --> 04:42.616
It's about this.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.653
This document states me as
the owner of Colibri Trawlers--

04:45.686 --> 04:49.122
the company tied to
the DEA bust at Galveston.

04:49.156 --> 04:51.158
Where'd you get this?

04:51.191 --> 04:53.594
In Cole's files.

04:53.627 --> 04:58.699
Camila was trying to frame me
so she could get herself off.

04:58.732 --> 04:59.867
Bullshit.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.336
Cole confirmed it.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.937
Did you know they were
having an affair?

05:03.971 --> 05:08.476
*

05:08.509 --> 05:10.177
Where is he?

05:10.210 --> 05:11.278
Dead.

05:11.311 --> 05:15.483
*

05:15.516 --> 05:17.851
You know Camila's not
just gonna let you walk away.

05:17.885 --> 05:21.021
There's another set
of documents like this...

05:21.054 --> 05:22.956
with her name on them.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.894
If she comes after me, they'll
go straight to the DEA.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.662
Tell her that.

05:28.696 --> 05:33.000
Wait, look, we both know
Camila has made some mistakes.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.404
But if you come back with me,
I can fix this.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.571
I'll protect you.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.206
She doesn't even have to know.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.340
I don't know what
you're talking about,

05:40.374 --> 05:42.142
and I don't wanna know.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.544
Just promise me,

05:43.577 --> 05:46.346
if she sends someone
after me,

05:46.380 --> 05:49.149
promise it won't be you.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.084
-Teresa...
-Promise.

05:51.118 --> 05:57.725
*

05:57.758 --> 05:59.259
Take care of yourself.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.431
Really.

06:03.464 --> 06:08.335
*

06:08.368 --> 06:10.337
(car door slams,
footsteps departing)

06:10.370 --> 06:17.377
*

06:25.953 --> 06:30.558
*

06:35.596 --> 06:38.231
WOMAN: Vargas, you got a meeting
with your new attorney

06:38.265 --> 06:39.733
and a visitor.

06:46.507 --> 06:49.342
We're gonna need
a moment of privacy.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.215
What did she say?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.984
She's got files linking you
to the Colibri Trawlers.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.620
She says, if we go after her
or Kelly Anne,

06:59.653 --> 07:02.456
those files
are going to the DEA.

07:02.490 --> 07:04.391
Where's Cole?

07:04.424 --> 07:06.393
Retired.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.629
CAMILA: Teresa hasn't come
to visit since she told me

07:08.662 --> 07:10.531
about the paperwork.

07:11.532 --> 07:14.768
You should have drug her back
by her teeth.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.670
We have more immediate threats
to deal with right now.

07:16.704 --> 07:19.072
JAMES: The judge in your case
is refusing to toss out

07:19.106 --> 07:21.341
the evidence
that the DEA planted.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.243
He set your bail at 2 million.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.411
He thinks you're a flight risk.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.313
Pay it.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.915
And then find Teresa.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.149
We don't have time
for that right now.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.851
Just find her.

07:30.884 --> 07:34.788
The Villalobos brothers
will take care of the rest.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.290
You can't save her now, James.

07:37.324 --> 07:41.929
*

07:41.962 --> 07:45.933
You crossed me once
to protect her.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.968
I won't let that happen again.

07:48.001 --> 07:54.742
*

08:12.425 --> 08:15.428
(register beeping)

08:20.500 --> 08:23.470
Anything else?

08:23.503 --> 08:26.239
Uh, two of those.

08:26.273 --> 08:29.309
*

08:29.342 --> 08:31.712
I'm gonna need to see
some ID for this.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.514
Sorry, store policy.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.383
Yeah.

08:36.416 --> 08:40.387
*

08:40.420 --> 08:41.889
Thanks.

08:41.922 --> 08:48.929
*

08:54.301 --> 08:57.004
*

08:57.037 --> 08:59.940
What do you think?

08:59.973 --> 09:01.241
-I like them.
-Yeah?

09:01.274 --> 09:04.111
Good, 'cause I got you one.

09:04.144 --> 09:07.047
Put 'em on.
It's like our disguise.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.716
-Thank you.
-(chuckles)

09:08.749 --> 09:12.519
*

09:12.552 --> 09:15.623
(engine revs)

09:15.656 --> 09:21.261
*

09:21.294 --> 09:23.597
We're just like
Thelma and Louise.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.965
You know who that is, right?

09:24.998 --> 09:26.967
I'm from Mexico,
not the Moon.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.436
Well, hell, I don't know
what kind of cultural references

09:29.469 --> 09:33.240
are gonna make sense
to a girl from Culiacán.

09:33.273 --> 09:36.710
Culiacán--it sounds
so picturesque.

09:36.744 --> 09:39.079
What was it like
growing up there?

09:39.112 --> 09:45.418
*

09:45.452 --> 09:48.221
It was beautiful.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.557
(phone buzzing)

09:50.590 --> 09:53.661
*

09:53.694 --> 09:55.663
You gonna answer that?

09:55.696 --> 09:59.166
(phone buzzing)

09:59.199 --> 10:03.003
*

10:03.036 --> 10:06.439
CAMILA:
Teresa, it's me.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.141
What do you want?

10:08.175 --> 10:09.743
CAMILA: I know
you spoke with James.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.178
Whatever Cole told you,

10:11.211 --> 10:12.345
it isn't true.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.114
I have the paperwork.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.983
*

10:16.016 --> 10:18.952
I had nothing to do with that.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.954
Cole was acting
on his own accord.

10:20.988 --> 10:22.990
*

10:23.023 --> 10:25.258
Why should I believe you?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.828
CAMILA: You are like
a daughter to me.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.798
I would never betray you
that way.

10:30.831 --> 10:33.200
The only thing I know
is that I can't trust you.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.703
Just come back, Teresa.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.338
CAMILA: Please.

10:38.371 --> 10:39.940
It's too late.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.342
You need to let me go.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.477
I don't want to hurt you,

10:44.511 --> 10:46.013
but I will.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.848
*

10:47.881 --> 10:50.183
Are you threatening me?

10:50.217 --> 10:53.453
You once told me
I was a good partner.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.322
We were never partners.

10:56.824 --> 10:57.958
It's a lie.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.526
*

10:59.559 --> 11:02.529
I'm glad you have
such a good memory,

11:02.562 --> 11:04.164
'cause you'll
remember my words.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.500
CAMILA: Remember this.

11:07.534 --> 11:11.404
Wherever you go,
whatever you do...

11:12.339 --> 11:13.741
I will hunt you down.

11:13.774 --> 11:19.980
*

11:20.013 --> 11:21.314
KELLY ANNE:
(exhales briskly)

11:21.348 --> 11:23.683
That is one scary bitch.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.987
*

11:27.020 --> 11:29.056
KELLY ANNE:
Driveway's here on the left.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.324
*

11:31.358 --> 11:33.927
It's been in the family
for years.

11:33.961 --> 11:36.163
-Secluded.
-Yeah.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.398
No neighborhood
for miles away.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.267
KELLY ANNE:
No cell service either,

11:40.300 --> 11:42.435
so it's just us out here.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.237
Perfect place to lay low,

11:44.271 --> 11:45.505
you know,
get our heads straight.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.107
(birds singing)

11:53.113 --> 11:56.616
Oh, sometimes I'd come up here
after a big fight.

11:57.885 --> 12:00.520
Like my little hideaway.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.923
Cole never knew
where I was going.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.424
(sighs)

12:04.457 --> 12:06.259
Never thought to ask either.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.427
(door creaks)

12:07.460 --> 12:11.698
(security alarm beeping)

12:11.731 --> 12:13.466
(beeping)

12:13.500 --> 12:14.567
You have an alarm.

12:14.601 --> 12:16.103
I have motion sensors

12:16.136 --> 12:18.038
around the property
to keep the bears away.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.440
Anything bigger than a possum
comes on the property,

12:20.473 --> 12:21.708
they'll go off.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.543
Turn it on.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.545
*

12:25.578 --> 12:27.747
(beeping)

12:31.418 --> 12:34.421
(woman speaking indistinctly
over intercom)

12:39.626 --> 12:42.729
What I have to tell you
is between you and me.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.965
No one else needs to hear.

12:44.998 --> 12:47.935
I'll bite.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.270
But nothing's
off the record here.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.074
Anything you say can and will
be held against you,

12:54.107 --> 12:56.109
so I suggest that you...

13:07.855 --> 13:08.856
(click)

13:16.563 --> 13:18.531
You planted the drugs in my car.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.402
That's a hell
of an accusation.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.405
You're gonna need proof.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.642
I don't need proof.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.879
I know.

13:31.912 --> 13:34.814
And you know.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.449
It's the truth.

13:36.483 --> 13:40.053
*

13:40.087 --> 13:41.554
I'll tell you what I know.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.825
I know
you own Colibri Trawlers.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.327
I know you're responsible

13:47.360 --> 13:50.063
for the drugs
we confiscated in Galveston

13:50.097 --> 13:52.165
and the murder
of a DEA Agent.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.268
I know that.

13:56.269 --> 13:58.138
You know that.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.807
And you're gonna sit in here
until I can prove it.

14:00.840 --> 14:07.314
*

14:07.347 --> 14:10.217
You're gonna need
to drop the charges

14:10.250 --> 14:12.452
before it's too late.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.022
Are you threatening me?

14:15.055 --> 14:16.924
*

14:16.957 --> 14:18.758
I'm suggesting...

14:20.460 --> 14:22.329
That you do what's right.

14:22.362 --> 14:26.166
*

14:26.199 --> 14:28.601
(footsteps approaching)

14:28.635 --> 14:30.270
POSTAK: Loya.

14:30.303 --> 14:36.276
*

14:36.309 --> 14:37.610
Thanks for the cigarette.

14:37.644 --> 14:41.548
*

14:41.581 --> 14:43.050
We got a hit on the BOLO.

14:43.083 --> 14:44.584
Kelly Anne's ID
was used at a gas station

14:44.617 --> 14:45.752
outside of town.

14:45.785 --> 14:46.786
Let's go.

14:46.819 --> 14:51.258
*

14:51.291 --> 14:54.027
These are the last of
the documents implicating you

14:54.061 --> 14:56.463
as the owner
of that trawler company.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.298
So my expert advice--

14:58.331 --> 15:00.900
toss 'em in that fire,
turn it to ash.

15:00.934 --> 15:04.204
And these are the documents
implicating Camila.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.939
Otherwise known
as our smoking gun

15:05.973 --> 15:08.408
and will heretofore
be referred to

15:08.441 --> 15:10.978
as our life insurance policy.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.380
See, I can speak legalese
when I need to.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.681
(chuckles)

15:17.250 --> 15:18.751
We need to keep these safe.

15:18.785 --> 15:20.787
Safe is with the DEA.

15:20.820 --> 15:22.222
If we give these to the DEA,

15:22.255 --> 15:24.557
she'll never stop hunting us.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.926
If we keep these,
she'll have to think twice.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.795
Maybe she'll let us go.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.432
That's a big maybe.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.435
(ominous music)

15:35.468 --> 15:38.138
*

15:38.171 --> 15:40.307
Do you remember when we met?

15:40.340 --> 15:43.076
You told me you had to flee
Mexico because the cartel

15:43.110 --> 15:44.811
murdered your boyfriend.

15:44.844 --> 15:47.580
Yeah, you thought
I was making that up.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.848
*

15:48.881 --> 15:51.618
It's ironic, isn't it?

15:51.651 --> 15:53.520
'Cause now here we are,

15:53.553 --> 15:55.655
you and me, on the run.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.961
How the hell
did it come to this?

16:01.995 --> 16:03.530
We're gonna
get through this, okay?

16:03.563 --> 16:04.931
You're gonna be fine.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.234
I won't let anything
happen to you.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.771
That's sweet, but if Camila
wants us dead,

16:11.804 --> 16:14.274
it's just a matter of time,
so...

16:14.307 --> 16:15.975
I'm gonna take a bath.

16:16.009 --> 16:22.715

16:23.550 --> 16:25.218
Guard.

16:25.252 --> 16:28.055

16:28.088 --> 16:29.856
I'm gonna need
to make a phone call.

16:29.889 --> 16:36.896
*

16:40.400 --> 16:43.203
(line trilling)

16:43.236 --> 16:44.404
DENNY: Yeah?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.206
Have you heard from our friends?

16:46.239 --> 16:47.507
DENNY: The Villalobos
brothers are here.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.309
How'd your call with Teresa go?

16:49.342 --> 16:51.811
She didn't buy it.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.346
Have you spoken with James?

16:53.380 --> 16:54.881
Yeah, he says
he has a line on her.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.483
We're waiting on his call now.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.718
Just remember...

16:58.751 --> 17:00.053
you can't kill her.

17:00.087 --> 17:01.888
Not until we have the papers.

17:01.921 --> 17:03.523
And if she puts up a fight?

17:03.556 --> 17:05.392
Then kill her.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.829
And burn whatever rat nest
she's been hiding in.

17:09.862 --> 17:16.869

17:37.457 --> 17:39.126
Kelly Anne, are you okay?

17:41.561 --> 17:42.595
(knocking)

17:42.629 --> 17:45.031
Kelly Anne, open the door.

17:45.064 --> 17:51.704
*

17:51.738 --> 17:54.441
Kelly Anne, can you hear me?

17:54.474 --> 17:55.742
*

17:55.775 --> 17:58.978
(grunts)
Can you hear me?

17:59.011 --> 18:01.248
Kelly Anne?
Can you hear me?

18:01.281 --> 18:03.316

Kelly Anne?

18:03.350 --> 18:04.717
Kelly Anne?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.986

18:11.191 --> 18:12.759

18:19.332 --> 18:20.900
-You're okay.

18:20.933 --> 18:25.838

18:25.872 --> 18:27.840
TERESA: Just breathe.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.676

18:29.709 --> 18:31.511
It's okay. Just breathe.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.989
-Here.
-(hoarsely) Thank you.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.767
I wasn't trying to hurt myself,

18:54.801 --> 18:56.636
in case you were wondering.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.338
I understand.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.606
It's okay.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.040
No, it's not.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.044
None of this is okay.

19:05.077 --> 19:08.147
I killed my husband.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.317
I can't ever take that back.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.621
And he lied,
and he cheated on me, yes,

19:14.654 --> 19:16.823
but I took his life.

19:19.526 --> 19:20.860
What does that make me?

19:22.662 --> 19:24.564
It makes you a survivor.

19:26.999 --> 19:29.135
Hmm.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.538
*

19:31.571 --> 19:34.341
I graduated law school
top of my class.

19:34.374 --> 19:37.176
*

19:37.210 --> 19:39.212
I was going somewhere.

19:39.246 --> 19:42.682
*

19:42.715 --> 19:44.116
Then I met Cole.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.688
I had this dream of us
being a power couple.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.223
*

19:50.257 --> 19:53.025
Wasn't long before
I realized that...

19:53.059 --> 19:56.529
all he wanted me for
was to smile and look pretty.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.566
It's not so easy to do
when you're constantly

19:59.599 --> 20:02.101
being told
how worthless you are.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.239
I'm not a survivor.
I'm a fool.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.508
*

20:08.541 --> 20:11.544
We're both here
because of the men we loved.

20:11.578 --> 20:15.047
*

20:15.081 --> 20:18.017
When I met Guero,
I knew who he was.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.454
I knew the risks,
but I didn't care.

20:21.488 --> 20:27.360
*

20:27.394 --> 20:29.429
Everyone makes mistakes.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.965
But not everyone
survives them.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.636
We will.

(alarm blaring)

20:39.672 --> 20:43.410

20:43.443 --> 20:46.579
It's okay. It's Pote.

-Bien.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.097
I always wanted to go camping.

21:05.131 --> 21:06.132
Really?

21:06.165 --> 21:07.600
Go inside, check it out.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.306
You think it's a mistake
bringing him along.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.074
The lighter the load...

21:15.107 --> 21:17.777
faster you run.

21:17.810 --> 21:21.414
You know Camila would have
gone after him to get to me.

21:21.448 --> 21:25.084
They slow us down,
it won't matter

21:25.117 --> 21:27.687

Look, stop, right there.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.302
Look at that.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.937
Ice cream?

21:44.971 --> 21:46.506
Yeah. They could be
holing up nearby.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.007
Or they could have
eaten it in the car

21:48.040 --> 21:50.309
and be halfway to Mexico
already.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.978
No, we got nothing else
to go on.

22:03.856 --> 22:06.025
I need to teach you
how to shoot.

22:07.827 --> 22:10.430
Listen, you've been around guns
your whole life.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.833
It's time for you to learn
how to protect yourself.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.167
You said you would protect me.

22:15.201 --> 22:17.404
I know, and I will.

But if something happens...

22:20.006 --> 22:22.208
What do you mean?

22:22.241 --> 22:24.744
You want to teach me
how to use a gun,

22:24.777 --> 22:26.513
but you're treating me
like a kid,

22:26.546 --> 22:27.647

it's gonna get easier.

and that broke my heart.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.861
That's why I came.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.530
To tell you that

26:04.563 --> 26:07.099
and to tell you
that you were right.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.068
About everything.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.037
You were right,
and I was so stupid.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.940
-Isabela--
-Let me finish, please.

26:13.973 --> 26:17.243
*

26:17.276 --> 26:21.914
I wanted to believe
Dad's lies so bad

26:21.948 --> 26:24.083
that I betrayed you,

26:24.116 --> 26:26.318
that I turned my back on you.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.320
And I was wrong.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.391
I hope you can forgive me.

26:32.424 --> 26:35.461
*

26:35.494 --> 26:38.230
No.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.800
It's me...

26:40.833 --> 26:43.169
that has to ask
for your forgiveness.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.172
You were wrong
about your father...

26:47.940 --> 26:49.676
But you were right about me.

26:49.709 --> 26:53.179
*

26:53.212 --> 26:56.615
I let my ambition...

26:59.485 --> 27:02.755
This need,

27:02.789 --> 27:05.357
drive me away from
the most important thing...

27:06.826 --> 27:08.160
You.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.696
*

27:09.729 --> 27:12.031
I just hope that,
when I get out of here...

27:12.064 --> 27:14.767
*

27:14.801 --> 27:16.602
We can start over.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.137
*

27:18.170 --> 27:20.606
I'd like that.

27:20.639 --> 27:26.979
*

27:30.349 --> 27:33.720
Are you still being
released tonight?

27:33.753 --> 27:35.121
Yeah.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.023
Then I'll be there waiting.

27:38.324 --> 27:40.326
ALONZO: Highway patrol
stopped two women

27:40.359 --> 27:42.628
matching Teresa and Kelly Anne's
description late last night

27:42.661 --> 27:44.463
driving that car.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.965
POSTAK: No service out here.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.234
We can't call for backup.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.336
Yeah, we wait,
and we could lose them again.

27:50.369 --> 27:52.404
*

27:52.438 --> 27:53.840
Watch my back.
I'm going in.

27:53.873 --> 28:00.612
*

28:07.386 --> 28:10.823
(beeping)

28:10.857 --> 28:12.658
Okay, now,
how did you do that?

28:12.691 --> 28:14.727
So you click the items,
and then you release them

28:14.761 --> 28:16.528
by pressing L.

28:16.562 --> 28:18.030
Mm...

28:18.064 --> 28:19.265
(alarm blaring)

28:19.298 --> 28:21.167
Somebody's here.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.168
(gun clicks)

28:22.201 --> 28:24.670
(alarm blaring)

28:24.703 --> 28:27.006
I'm not going to prison.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.607
I'll handle him.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.909
Get Kelly Anne and Tony
and get out of here.

28:29.942 --> 28:31.577
No, I'm not leaving you alone.

28:31.610 --> 28:33.412
I can't let anything
happen to them.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.182
Please.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.684
*

28:38.717 --> 28:41.587
I'll go out first.

28:41.620 --> 28:42.789
Stay here with Tony.

28:42.822 --> 28:44.590
(keypad beeps, alarm ceases)

28:44.623 --> 28:48.027
*

28:48.060 --> 28:49.228
Let me speak with Teresa.

28:49.261 --> 28:53.699
*

28:53.732 --> 28:55.634
Just wanna talk.

28:55.667 --> 28:57.736
First, let my friends leave.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.572
What I have to say
affects everyone in that cabin.

29:00.606 --> 29:02.241
This isn't a negotiation.

29:04.443 --> 29:05.711
Let's go.

29:05.744 --> 29:11.250
*

29:11.283 --> 29:12.251
Your gun.

29:12.284 --> 29:19.291
*

29:24.596 --> 29:27.066
Something happens to Teresa,

29:27.099 --> 29:28.767
I will hunt you down.

29:28.801 --> 29:33.739
*

29:33.772 --> 29:34.907
Inside.

29:34.941 --> 29:41.180
*

29:47.153 --> 29:49.521
(engine turns over)

29:49.555 --> 29:52.524
Tell whoever's out there
to let them through.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.793
Anyone tries to stop them,
you know what happens.

29:54.827 --> 30:01.133
*

30:02.301 --> 30:03.836
Let 'em pass.

30:03.870 --> 30:04.871
POSTAK (over radio):
Copy that.

30:04.904 --> 30:06.272
*

30:06.305 --> 30:07.273
Inside.

30:07.306 --> 30:14.313
*

30:18.184 --> 30:19.551
(door creaks)

30:20.552 --> 30:22.354
You wanna talk?

30:22.388 --> 30:24.957
You mind pointing that thing
somewhere else?

30:24.991 --> 30:27.293
Talk.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.494
What do you want?

30:30.262 --> 30:31.730
You know what I want.

30:31.763 --> 30:33.299
Cooperate with me
against Camila.

30:33.332 --> 30:35.167
We already had
this conversation.

30:35.201 --> 30:38.337
Yeah, that was before
Camila was trying to kill you.

30:38.370 --> 30:40.239
You're on the run.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.875
And it doesn't take a genius
to know who you're running from.

30:42.909 --> 30:44.343
You're here
to offer protection?

30:44.376 --> 30:47.346
No.
I'm here to offer you life.

30:47.379 --> 30:50.349
(ominous music)

30:50.382 --> 30:57.223
*

30:59.525 --> 31:00.592
POSTAK: Denny?

31:00.626 --> 31:03.029
What are you doing out here?

31:03.062 --> 31:04.296
Got a call for backup.

31:05.631 --> 31:06.832
From who?

31:06.865 --> 31:08.100
Wasn't you?

31:08.134 --> 31:10.169
No, it wasn't.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.870
(car approaching)

31:13.572 --> 31:14.907
Who the hell is this?

31:16.575 --> 31:18.244
They're with the tactical unit.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.879
*

31:20.913 --> 31:22.681
You think Camila's
just gonna let you walk off

31:22.714 --> 31:24.083
into the sunset?

31:24.116 --> 31:25.584
You're smarter than that.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.586
I'm not a rat.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.888
That little kid
that's here with you,

31:29.922 --> 31:32.758
you think he cares
about your street code?

31:32.791 --> 31:34.526
He wants to live.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.495
So does Kelly Anne
and so do you.

31:38.564 --> 31:39.631
It's not that easy.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.233
ALONZO: Yes, it is.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.035
Help me put Camila away,

31:43.069 --> 31:45.537
and you'll be protected--
all of you.

31:45.571 --> 31:48.240
But if you don't come
with me now, chances are,

31:48.274 --> 31:49.708
the next time I see you,
you'll be in a body bag.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.078
*

31:52.111 --> 31:53.545
-Hands in the air!
-Val, listen--

31:53.579 --> 31:54.947
-Now!
-You need to calm down.

31:54.981 --> 31:55.948
-(shouts in Spanish)
-Val--

31:55.982 --> 31:57.249
Don't move, Denny!

31:57.283 --> 31:58.450
(gunshot)

31:58.484 --> 32:00.953
*

32:00.987 --> 32:03.155
What was that?
Who's out there?

32:03.189 --> 32:04.756
(winces) Shit!

32:04.790 --> 32:07.559
*

32:07.593 --> 32:09.228
(gunshots)

32:09.261 --> 32:11.463
*

32:11.497 --> 32:12.631
You lied to me.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.466
No, I--I swear to God.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.834
I have to get out of here,
move!

32:15.867 --> 32:20.239
*

32:20.272 --> 32:22.574
(engine revving)

32:22.608 --> 32:28.080
*

32:28.114 --> 32:29.015
TERESA: Go.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.116
(gunshot)

32:30.149 --> 32:33.252
(gunshots)

32:33.285 --> 32:35.287
(glass shattering)

32:35.321 --> 32:38.157
(gunshots)

32:38.190 --> 32:39.158
(electricity crackles)

32:39.191 --> 32:40.826
*

32:46.298 --> 32:48.200
Postak, Postak!

32:48.234 --> 32:50.669
Come in, Postak!

32:52.038 --> 32:54.306
How many are out there?

32:54.340 --> 32:55.341
I can't tell.

32:55.374 --> 32:56.775
Who are they?

32:56.808 --> 32:59.945
They must be someone
that Camila sent.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.947
How bad are you hurt?

33:01.980 --> 33:05.051
I'll live, for now.

33:05.084 --> 33:07.453
But I'm gonna need a gun.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.687
It's the only way.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.290
You gotta trust me.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.624
(gunshots)

33:12.658 --> 33:14.626
(glass shattering)

33:14.660 --> 33:17.029
*

33:17.063 --> 33:19.298
(grunting)

33:19.331 --> 33:21.167
I got 12 rounds.
What are you holding?

33:21.200 --> 33:23.802
-15.
-(sighs)

33:23.835 --> 33:25.471
Okay, we gotta conserve.

33:25.504 --> 33:26.638
Don't shoot
until you got a clear target.

33:26.672 --> 33:27.639
Okay.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.841
*

33:29.875 --> 33:31.877
What are they doing out there?

33:31.910 --> 33:35.514
MAN (over radio):
(speaking Spanish)

33:35.547 --> 33:38.484
*

33:38.517 --> 33:41.153
This is Special Agent Loya
with the DEA.

33:41.187 --> 33:42.221
Who's this?

33:47.893 --> 33:49.195
So you're
the big, bad wolf, huh?

33:49.228 --> 33:50.929
MAN: I've come for the girl.

33:50.962 --> 33:53.099
She has something
that belongs to Camila.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.767
Send her out, and you'll live.

33:55.801 --> 33:57.436
What is he talking about?

33:57.469 --> 33:58.937
It's a trick.

33:58.970 --> 34:02.874
*

34:02.908 --> 34:04.543
You know I can't do that.

34:04.576 --> 34:07.346
MAN: Then I will huff,
and I will puff,

34:07.379 --> 34:09.915
and I will blow your house in.

34:09.948 --> 34:11.750
I'm in here.
Come and get me.

34:11.783 --> 34:13.252
What the hell are you doing?

34:13.285 --> 34:15.887
I'm not gonna sit around
and wait to die.

34:15.921 --> 34:17.689
I'm gonna give them a target.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.125
When they fire,
you see where they are,

34:19.158 --> 34:20.359
then you shoot.

34:20.392 --> 34:21.693
Okay, ready?

34:21.727 --> 34:24.796
*

34:24.830 --> 34:26.565
(gunshots)

34:26.598 --> 34:28.567
(glass shattering)

34:28.600 --> 34:30.068
(gunshots)

34:30.102 --> 34:33.272
(glass shattering)

34:33.305 --> 34:35.541
-How did we do?
-Got one of them.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.876
Okay, one more time.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.278
Ready?

34:39.311 --> 34:40.279
Wait!

34:40.312 --> 34:41.447
(groans)

34:41.480 --> 34:42.814
They got a bead on us.

34:42.848 --> 34:45.817
(ominous music)

34:45.851 --> 34:47.819
*

34:52.924 --> 34:54.293
Drop it, Val.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.263
*

34:57.296 --> 34:59.265
I will shoot you.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.433
I said put it down.

35:01.467 --> 35:06.938
*

35:06.972 --> 35:08.974
What do you think?

35:09.007 --> 35:10.409
It's your turn to look.

35:10.442 --> 35:14.646
*

35:14.680 --> 35:15.947
(gunshots)

35:15.981 --> 35:18.184
(glass shattering)

35:18.217 --> 35:20.586
(gasping)

35:20.619 --> 35:23.689
Whatever you did, you must've
really pissed Camila off.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.191
I just wanted out.

35:25.224 --> 35:29.361
*

35:29.395 --> 35:30.529
Tony's video game...

35:30.562 --> 35:31.863
(gunshots)

35:31.897 --> 35:33.199
(glass shattering)

35:33.232 --> 35:35.701
(gunshots)

35:35.734 --> 35:38.470
*

35:38.504 --> 35:39.838
ALONZO: It's a tracking device.

35:39.871 --> 35:41.473
That must be how they found you.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.376
It was a gift from James.

35:44.410 --> 35:47.012
(thudding)

35:47.045 --> 35:49.848
Is this when you tell me
what a fool I was?

35:49.881 --> 35:53.452
No, this is where
I'll say I'm sorry,

35:53.485 --> 35:54.453
truly.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.021
*

35:56.054 --> 35:58.790
We didn't just meet.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.892
I was targeted.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.961
-(grunts)
-Oh!

36:02.994 --> 36:04.162
(both grunting)

36:04.196 --> 36:05.197
POSTAK: Ahh!

36:05.231 --> 36:07.399
(both grunting)

36:07.433 --> 36:12.304
*

36:12.338 --> 36:13.672
(gunshot)

36:13.705 --> 36:16.007
(thudding)

36:16.041 --> 36:17.309
Someone's on the roof.

36:17.343 --> 36:18.477
(thudding)

36:18.510 --> 36:19.678
What the hell are they doing?

36:19.711 --> 36:21.847
(clanging)

36:21.880 --> 36:22.914
ALONZO: Take cover! Grenade!

36:23.782 --> 36:26.785
(high-pitched ringing)

36:32.123 --> 36:35.060
(muffled gunshots)

36:35.093 --> 36:36.895
*

36:36.928 --> 36:39.831
(distorted ringing)

36:39.865 --> 36:40.866
(gunshots)

36:40.899 --> 36:41.933
(glass shattering)

36:41.967 --> 36:43.101
(gas hissing)

36:43.134 --> 36:45.671

-(coughing)

36:45.704 --> 36:47.873
(grunts)

36:47.906 --> 36:52.678

36:52.711 --> 36:54.546
(coughs)

36:54.580 --> 36:55.547
ALONZO: They're inside!

36:55.581 --> 36:58.250
*

36:58.284 --> 37:00.185
(grunting)

37:00.218 --> 37:04.423
*

37:04.456 --> 37:08.594
(grunting)

37:08.627 --> 37:14.266
*

37:14.300 --> 37:16.702
-(yells)
-(grunts)

37:16.735 --> 37:18.904
(both grunting)

37:18.937 --> 37:21.607
(screams)

37:21.640 --> 37:23.475
(snarls)

37:24.910 --> 37:27.879
(screaming)

37:27.913 --> 37:30.916
*

37:30.949 --> 37:33.251
Not so big and bad now.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.220
(gunshot)

37:35.253 --> 37:41.293
*

37:49.301 --> 37:52.003
You still think I'm gonna
end up in a body bag?

37:52.037 --> 37:54.205
(scoffs) No.

37:55.341 --> 37:57.242
But if you don't come with me,

37:57.275 --> 37:59.445
we both know who you'll become.

37:59.478 --> 38:01.913
He doesn't know
what he's talking about.

38:01.947 --> 38:03.849
A queen isn't made.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.651
She's born.

38:05.684 --> 38:08.654
You were baptized in blood
a long time ago.

38:08.687 --> 38:15.627
*

38:15.661 --> 38:17.829
Every time I run, people die.

38:17.863 --> 38:19.765
That won't change
if I go with you.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.833
The only way to stop it
is to fight.

38:21.867 --> 38:25.003
*

38:25.036 --> 38:27.105
I'm gonna let you
walk out of here

38:27.138 --> 38:29.508
'cause you saved my life,

38:29.541 --> 38:30.976
but you need to know...

38:31.009 --> 38:33.945
*

38:33.979 --> 38:35.280
I'll be coming for you.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.383
*

38:37.416 --> 38:38.384
Get in line.

38:38.417 --> 38:45.424
*

38:49.395 --> 38:50.996
(engine turns over)

38:51.029 --> 38:58.036
*

39:02.708 --> 39:05.110
Loya, Loya!

39:06.344 --> 39:07.646
You all right?

39:07.679 --> 39:09.415
(sighs) Barely.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.318
What's that?

39:13.351 --> 39:15.554
(grunts)

39:15.587 --> 39:22.594
*

39:24.095 --> 39:25.397
Our smoking gun.

39:25.431 --> 39:32.438
*

39:45.717 --> 39:47.285
WOMAN (over TV):
All of this

39:47.318 --> 39:49.287
adds to the picture
of violence

39:49.320 --> 39:51.356
surrounding the Vargas cartel,
including a recent clash

39:51.389 --> 39:52.558
with DEA agents where
a spokesman for the agency...

39:52.591 --> 39:53.592
(knocking)

39:53.625 --> 39:55.561
(gun clicks)

39:55.594 --> 39:57.395
WOMAN (over TV): ...has paid
the ultimate price.

39:57.429 --> 39:59.798
DEA Special Agent in Charge
Karen Trusdale

39:59.831 --> 40:01.933
was quoted as saying,
"Of course we are doing

40:01.967 --> 40:03.602
everything in our power"...

40:03.635 --> 40:06.237
(broadcast continues
indistinctly)

40:06.271 --> 40:08.206
WOMAN (over TV):
...The continuing efforts

40:08.239 --> 40:10.108
of Agent Alonzo Loya,
who made this a reality...

40:10.141 --> 40:11.543
Whose house is this?

40:11.577 --> 40:13.411
Don't worry.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.214
They move.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.049
WOMAN (over TV):
...will finally face a judge.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.951
Officials from
the Drug Enforcement Agency

40:19.985 --> 40:21.787
are already bracing
for what's expected to be

40:21.820 --> 40:23.989
a bloody power struggle
between rival cartels

40:24.022 --> 40:25.791
vying to take her place.

40:25.824 --> 40:27.726
Vargas was about to be
released on bail.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.629
However, DEA Agent Loya
turned up new evidence,

40:30.662 --> 40:33.732
an alleged smoking gun
tied her to Colibri Trawlers,

40:33.765 --> 40:35.400
a shipping company
that was tied

40:35.433 --> 40:37.402
to the recent seizure
of 250 kilos

40:37.435 --> 40:39.337
in Galveston.

40:39.370 --> 40:41.507
We now go live at
the Dallas County Courthouse.

40:41.540 --> 40:43.308
What is the scene here
at the courthouse today?

40:43.341 --> 40:44.943
MAN (over TV):
Lawyers for Camila Vargas

40:44.976 --> 40:46.912
have made
an official statement

40:46.945 --> 40:48.614
to the press today,
calling the charges baseless

40:48.647 --> 40:50.649
and totally without merit

40:50.682 --> 40:53.084
and implied a lawsuit against
the federal government

40:53.118 --> 40:54.586
may be in the works.

40:54.620 --> 40:57.288
*

40:57.322 --> 40:58.824
(door shuts)

40:58.857 --> 41:00.659
*

41:00.692 --> 41:02.694
This fight is between
me and Camila.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.164
I can't ask you to stay.

41:06.197 --> 41:07.766
I'm not going anywhere.

41:07.799 --> 41:11.870
*

41:11.903 --> 41:16.274
James is the one that
told Camila where Tony was.

41:16.307 --> 41:19.377
That's how the
sicarios found us.

41:19.410 --> 41:21.780
They were playing me
the whole time.

41:21.813 --> 41:25.784
You only saw the bait,
never the hook.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.886
*

41:27.919 --> 41:30.121
In the morning,

41:30.155 --> 41:31.456
can you take
Tony and Kelly Anne

41:31.489 --> 41:33.191
somewhere Camila
can't find them?

41:33.224 --> 41:34.660
Don't worry.

41:34.693 --> 41:36.962
They'll be safe.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.496
Then what?

41:39.665 --> 41:43.301
Then we're gonna
go back to Dallas.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.403
Take what's rightfully mine.

41:45.436 --> 41:48.506
*
