00:00.530 --> 00:04.365
My name is Michael Westen.
I used to be a spy until...

00:04.465 --> 00:07.080
We got a burn notice on
you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.780 --> 00:12.575
When you're burned, you've got nothing
-- no cash, no credit, no job history.

00:12.675 --> 00:14.750
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.850 --> 00:16.800
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:17.170 --> 00:19.770
You do whatever work comes your way.

00:20.060 --> 00:23.065
You rely on anyone who's
still talking to you.

00:23.165 --> 00:25.855
- A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...
- should we shoot them?

00:25.955 --> 00:28.475
An old friend who used to
inform on you to the FBI...

00:28.575 --> 00:31.130
you know spies -- a bunch
of bitchy little girls.

00:31.230 --> 00:32.030
Family, too...

00:32.045 --> 00:33.125
hey, is that your mom again?

00:33.225 --> 00:34.345
If you're desperate.

00:34.445 --> 00:35.765
Someone needs your help, Michael.

00:35.865 --> 00:41.860
Bottom line -- until you figure out who
burned you, you're not going anywhere.

00:42.440 --> 00:44.340
Previously on "burn notice"...

00:44.440 --> 00:46.485
give us the man who
killed our operatives,

00:46.585 --> 00:48.885
and you and I can have a
little chat about your future.

00:48.985 --> 00:50.395
You didn't tell her
it was victor, did you?

00:50.495 --> 00:52.045
The man has tried to kill you twice.

00:52.145 --> 00:53.935
He's the one enemy I know Carla has.

00:54.035 --> 00:56.265
I'd like to at least talk
to him before I turn him in.

00:56.365 --> 00:59.375
You tell Carla someone else went
after her operatives, and we're friends.

00:59.475 --> 01:02.830
I have questions, and I have
a feeling you can answer them.

01:02.930 --> 01:03.940
Well, that's not on the menu.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.730
I'm asking for answers.

01:21.820 --> 01:26.690
The most dangerous time in any operation
is just as everything's coming together.

01:26.790 --> 01:31.770
You never know whether you're about to get a pat
on the back or a bullet to the back of the head.

Of course, there's not much you can
do but act like everything's fine.

01:45.730 --> 01:46.825
Hello, Michael.

01:46.925 --> 01:48.855
Care for a chocolate-covered
pomegranate seed?

01:48.955 --> 01:49.905
Khava tea?

01:50.005 --> 01:53.195
You drove all the way out here
to offer me a snack? I'm touched.

01:53.295 --> 01:55.760
It's a taste of your former life.

01:56.240 --> 01:57.590
Good old days before the burn notice,

01:57.690 --> 02:02.930
when Michael Westen was just a carefree
spy in the deserts of Afghanistan.

02:06.670 --> 02:09.495
You know, I was like you
once, Michael. Lived for the job.

02:09.595 --> 02:12.235
Eventually, I discovered the
job doesn't love you back.

02:12.335 --> 02:14.280
- You got burned?
- Yes.

02:14.790 --> 02:16.915
I was angry at first.

02:17.015 --> 02:19.320
Then I found I didn't miss it.

02:19.770 --> 02:22.435
You might find the same thing, Michael.

02:22.535 --> 02:24.275
And if I want my life back?

02:24.375 --> 02:27.710
Well... that's why I'm here.

02:28.870 --> 02:31.125
Anything's possible if you do your job.

02:31.225 --> 02:32.525
I'm working on it. You know me.

02:32.625 --> 02:35.345
This is serious, Michael.
Management's not happy.

02:35.445 --> 02:38.370
They'll be in town shortly to
make sure everything's resolved.

02:38.470 --> 02:40.860
These are not people to be
trifled with, Michael, believe me.

02:40.960 --> 02:41.830
I'll do my best, then.

02:41.930 --> 02:44.830
Remember, there are worse
things than being blacklisted.

02:44.930 --> 02:48.250
Oh, I know. I could be this guy.

03:08.930 --> 03:10.535
Hey, Mikey. You sure
you weren't followed?

03:10.635 --> 03:12.095
Sure as I can be.

03:12.195 --> 03:15.360
Unless she's got an invisible
helicopter, I think we're fine.

03:15.460 --> 03:16.550
Yeah, I wouldn't put it past her.

03:16.650 --> 03:18.925
She needs to back off if
I'm gonna solve her problem.

03:19.025 --> 03:22.115
From what I can tell, she really
needs me to solve the problem.

03:22.215 --> 03:24.095
Let's see how our guest is doing.

03:24.195 --> 03:25.855
Last I checked, he was sleeping.

03:25.955 --> 03:29.840
It's kind of tough to sleep when
you're cable-tied to a chair.

03:30.370 --> 03:31.715
How long's he been in there alone?

03:31.815 --> 03:34.935
A few hours. You said
not to open the door.

03:35.035 --> 03:36.280
What's in that?

03:36.380 --> 03:38.010
Oh, beanbag rounds.

03:38.110 --> 03:40.420
At this range, it'll break a few ribs.

03:47.960 --> 03:48.845
Nice place.

03:48.945 --> 03:51.800
I stayed in a bed and
breakfast like this once.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.160
Glad you like it.

03:54.260 --> 03:58.735
When you're dealing with a trained operative, you
have to assume they're as good as you are.

03:58.835 --> 04:04.380
If you'd have cut through your restraints given a
few hours alone, chances are he had the same idea.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.790
That's enough rough-housing, boys.

04:24.380 --> 04:26.950
It's always fun until someone gets hurt.

04:27.470 --> 04:30.520
<font color=#00FFFF>Burn
Notice Season02 Episode16</font>

04:33.760 --> 04:35.915
So, now we're cozy.
What shall we talk about?

04:36.015 --> 04:38.800
Why don't we start with
why you tried to blow me up?

04:38.900 --> 04:41.130
You make it sound so personal.

04:41.530 --> 04:44.285
I was removing operatives from the
field. You were cogs in a machine.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.445
I just hit that machine
with a baseball bat.

04:46.545 --> 04:48.550
Why'd you hit the machine, then?

04:49.610 --> 04:52.465
You know, not to be rude, but I'd
just as soon skip to the end here.

04:52.565 --> 04:53.140
The end?

04:53.240 --> 04:56.745
Well, if there's one thing everyone knows about
Michael Westen, it's that he wants his job back.

04:56.845 --> 04:58.555
And here I sit, your
shot at getting that.

04:58.655 --> 05:01.930
Now, it doesn't take an intelligence
analyst to see how this ends.

05:02.030 --> 05:04.915
So, wake me when Carla gets here,

05:05.015 --> 05:09.240
or shoot me now and
save everyone some time.

05:09.440 --> 05:12.500
You went after Carla's
organization. Why?

05:14.850 --> 05:17.125
Why does it matter?

05:17.225 --> 05:19.800
Nothing I say will change the
fact that I'm your ticket out.

05:19.900 --> 05:23.460
Why is your curiosity
more important than my nap?

05:23.560 --> 05:25.255
You're out of moves here, victor.

05:25.355 --> 05:28.635
Your only shot here is to trust me.

05:28.735 --> 05:32.180
Hmm, trust you. Just like that.

05:33.840 --> 05:36.890
You have nothing to lose
and everything to gain.

05:44.540 --> 05:46.430
I was CIA.

05:46.530 --> 05:50.500
My family was stationed with me in
Mexico city. An op went bad, and...

05:50.960 --> 05:53.610
I lost my wife and son.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.440
The burn notice went out the same day.

05:55.540 --> 06:00.600
I was out on my ass, my family was dead, not
even enough money for a bus ticket home.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.385
And then you got a call from Carla.

06:02.485 --> 06:06.770
Well, I was more enthusiastic about
the opportunity than you were.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.785
It was a way back in, a
way to get payback.

06:09.885 --> 06:14.210
Well, it took me some time, but
I found what I was looking for.

06:20.090 --> 06:24.870
And the punch line, the really, really
funny part is, it was Carla.

06:27.050 --> 06:30.580
She had my family killed
as part of my recruitment.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.560
I'm sorry.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.485
By that time, I was inside.

06:36.585 --> 06:38.015
I was an effective operative.

06:38.115 --> 06:42.920
And I figured,"Hey, while I'm here,
why not gut the entire organization?"

06:45.390 --> 06:48.010
Well, I took my shot.

06:49.340 --> 06:52.090
And here we are.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.530
Carla doesn't know you're here.

06:55.840 --> 07:00.280
If you're telling the truth, maybe
we can work on this together.

07:05.540 --> 07:07.965
I've got a boat docked out
at the end of Randall Key.

07:08.065 --> 07:10.960
The cabin is booby-trapped
with a claymore.

07:13.380 --> 07:15.600
Check under the bed.

07:16.270 --> 07:19.300
If you want proof, that's
the best I can do.

07:34.230 --> 07:35.755
You're trusting him?

07:35.855 --> 07:38.920
How many times does someone have to try
to kill you before he's crossed the line?

07:39.020 --> 07:40.350
We came to an understanding.

07:40.450 --> 07:44.300
You know, when I was a kid, I
adopted a dog that I found.

07:44.400 --> 07:48.830
He had these big eyes, and I used to rub his
belly, and I thought we had something special --

07:48.930 --> 07:50.515
right up until he bit a chunk out of me.

07:50.615 --> 07:51.645
I'll show you the scar if you'd like.

07:51.745 --> 07:54.040
- I'll be careful, Sam.
- I'm coming with you.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.725
Give him some air. See what
else you can get out of him.

07:58.825 --> 08:01.090
Rub his belly if you need to.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.050
Nice work.

08:50.510 --> 08:53.000
Victor should probably
teacha class or something.

08:56.550 --> 08:58.200
Clear.

08:58.490 --> 09:00.575
He said to checkunder the bed.

09:00.675 --> 09:03.505
Spam and cap'n crunch.

09:03.605 --> 09:05.290
No wonder he's so erratic.

09:05.390 --> 09:09.495
Spies are supposed to ravel light
with nothing that could identify them.

09:09.595 --> 09:14.095
Some do, but most find that staying sane
requires staying connected to something

09:14.195 --> 09:17.640
that reminds them why
they do what they do.

09:17.950 --> 09:23.535
Pictures are particularly dangerous to
carry, unless the people in them are already dead.

09:23.635 --> 09:27.600
Michael, his little boy was only 4.

09:28.100 --> 09:31.550
Who knew you could feel this bad for
a psychopathon the edge of sanity?

09:31.650 --> 09:34.060
People don't get thereon their own, Fi.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.735
Being under Carla's thumb, it's a strain.

09:36.835 --> 09:38.265
Well, you've done all right.

09:38.365 --> 09:41.000
I never lost everyone I cared about.

09:45.950 --> 09:47.955
You and I need to have a little chat,

09:48.055 --> 09:51.355
'cause you've got a long way to go
before I believe all this business.

09:51.455 --> 09:53.800
Is this an interrogation?

09:53.900 --> 09:56.300
No. That's such an ugly word.

09:56.750 --> 10:00.715
I just want you to show me
that you are who you say you are.

10:00.815 --> 10:02.035
Establish your identity.

10:02.135 --> 10:06.140
That's, what, number five in the
military interrogation manual?

10:07.740 --> 10:09.775
Look, we don't have
to play any games here.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.640
The fact is, we're both on
the same side, right?

10:11.740 --> 10:13.960
"Fear down."Approach 14, right?

10:14.850 --> 10:17.675
Yeah. I believe it is number 14.
So how about this?

10:17.775 --> 10:19.870
Technique number one:
the direct approach.

10:19.970 --> 10:24.090
My best friend, Mike, is out there putting his
butt on the line for you, so I want some answers.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.345
Now, the folks that
you work for --

10:25.445 --> 10:28.475
is this a government
agency, a foreign power?

10:28.575 --> 10:30.700
What are we up against?

10:32.090 --> 10:34.400
Well, they never gave me a
peek at the employee handbook.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.290
All I know is they run black ops.

10:36.390 --> 10:38.225
Could be multinational.
Could be work for hire.

10:38.325 --> 10:41.040
They break jobs into pieces so
no one gets the big picture.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.085
Well, that's not a good sign. Why Miami?

10:43.185 --> 10:45.015
They're in cities all over.

10:45.115 --> 10:48.720
Although from what I can tell, they may
have to shut down in Miami for a while.

10:49.330 --> 10:51.500
- Well, I don't like the sound of that.
- You shouldn't.

10:51.990 --> 10:57.760
If Michael doesn't hand me over, Carla's gonna
cut her losses, starting with Michael's family.

11:00.470 --> 11:02.860
She's gonna be a busy girl.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.100
What's wrong?

11:13.200 --> 11:15.345
Well, I've been talking to
our unstable friend.

11:15.445 --> 11:16.340
This doesn't sound good, Mike.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.605
I mean, the big boys are coming into
town, and if we don't hand him over...

11:19.705 --> 11:20.795
No, we're not handing anyone over.

11:20.895 --> 11:24.030
I'm just saying, we could
have a war on our hands.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.715
- Let me cancel my meeting.
- No, don't.

11:26.815 --> 11:29.370
We need to keep everything
looking like business as usual.

11:29.470 --> 11:32.195
Sam, can you pick up my
mom? Take her up to Orlando.

11:32.295 --> 11:33.430
Make it look like a day trip.

11:33.530 --> 11:36.055
I don't want her in town if
anything starts happening.

11:36.155 --> 11:36.955
I'm on it.

11:36.965 --> 11:40.390
- You sure you don't want me to-- 
- No, Fi, go. I'll be all right.

11:47.180 --> 11:51.290
Stretch those arms out. Get up. That's
it. Stretch way out, way out. More.

11:51.590 --> 11:54.560
What a great exercise it is for
your shoulders and your arms,

11:54.660 --> 11:57.695
to help you when you wear those
sleeveless dresses, you gals,

11:57.795 --> 11:59.215
to really help you look
like you should look.

11:59.315 --> 12:02.280
And you guys out there, I want you to
look like a man's supposed to look.

12:05.820 --> 12:08.295
Sam! You scared me.

12:08.395 --> 12:13.160
Sorry. Listen, Madeline, I hate to do this
to you again, but, uh, we got a situation.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.395
Why, what's wrong? Is Michael okay?

12:15.495 --> 12:16.795
He's fine. But is your stuff handy?

12:16.895 --> 12:19.185
'Cause it's time for
an emergency trip to Disney World.

12:19.285 --> 12:20.665
Disney World?

12:20.765 --> 12:23.250
Why in God's name would I
want to go to Disney World?

12:23.350 --> 12:26.025
Because it'sa magical kingdom with
lots of witnesses and great security.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.085
So if you could just
get your bag, we'll go.

12:28.185 --> 12:31.210
No. I'm not running for Michael anymore!

12:31.470 --> 12:36.365
And I think it's time that all of you stopped 
treating me like a baby and told me what's going on.

12:36.465 --> 12:38.310
Uh, that's a long story.

12:38.410 --> 12:40.075
Wonderful. I love stories.

12:40.175 --> 12:43.075
Yeah, but, see, it's the kind of story
that's best told on the way up to Orlando.

12:43.175 --> 12:46.820
Do you know they have a hotel up there where
the giraffes, they come right up to your balcony?

12:46.920 --> 12:49.275
Well, as much as I love giraffes...

12:49.375 --> 12:52.390
I'm not uprooting my life
again to run from something --

12:52.490 --> 12:54.280
I don't even know what it's about, Sam!

12:54.380 --> 12:56.820
So I'm not going anywhere...

12:57.590 --> 12:59.020
till I get some answers.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.605
Uh, oof, well, it's-- 
It's complicated.

13:02.705 --> 13:08.520
Uh, oof, well, the sooner you explain, the
sooner we'll be off to Cinderella's Castle.

13:10.870 --> 13:13.460
Victor, I sympathize with your situation.

13:13.560 --> 13:18.735
But it's a little hard to trust someone
when they've tried to kill you four times.

13:18.835 --> 13:20.580
Four? That seems high.

13:21.130 --> 13:24.080
- Oh, come on, you're counting earlier with the chair.
- Yes.

13:25.490 --> 13:27.535
Listen, sport, relax.

13:27.635 --> 13:30.585
This will all be over
shortly for you and for me.

13:30.685 --> 13:33.820
Well, you told Carla to back
off so you could find me, yes?

13:34.300 --> 13:35.480
Of course you did.

13:35.580 --> 13:38.445
They'll still run surveillance, though, and
check in. What time is it? 10:30 or so?

13:38.545 --> 13:39.405
About that.

13:39.505 --> 13:41.520
I've been off the grid long
enough for them to get suspicious.

13:41.620 --> 13:45.755
They'll have gotten the go-ahead to hunt you, set
up a perimeter around your last known location.

13:45.855 --> 13:47.545
If there's a major
roadaround here,

13:47.645 --> 13:49.860
they'll be waiting at it. Wonderful!

13:49.960 --> 13:54.365
Look at it this way: When Carla finds out you
hid me, all your questions will be resolved...

13:54.465 --> 13:57.290
with a bullet to the head for both of us.

13:58.900 --> 13:59.715
Oh, you're gonna kill me yourself.

13:59.815 --> 14:03.040
Well, hell, yeah, if you're gonna step to
the bell, you might as well ring it, huh?

14:07.920 --> 14:10.200
Let's get out of here.

14:12.580 --> 14:14.580
Wait, wait, you're gonna help me?

14:14.680 --> 14:17.260
I get to be one of Michael Westen's clients,

14:17.360 --> 14:21.865
one of the desperate people to whom you
lend your razor-sharp mind and fists of fury?

14:21.965 --> 14:24.110
Lucky you.

14:24.510 --> 14:27.420
*******

14:31.690 --> 14:33.660
Oh, looks like they were
closer than I thought.

14:33.760 --> 14:36.220
Probably just waiting to see our
pretty faces before they moved in.

14:36.320 --> 14:37.245
You drive.

14:37.345 --> 14:41.455
You don't last long as a spy
if you don't trust anyone.

14:41.555 --> 14:46.280
If you're looking over your shoulder to see who's
coming after you, you can't see where you're going.

14:46.380 --> 14:49.360
Sometimes you just
have to trust your gut.

15:32.220 --> 15:33.395
These guys are pretty good.

15:33.495 --> 15:35.115
Looks like they pulled
out all the stops for us.

15:35.215 --> 15:36.015
I'm flattered.

15:36.075 --> 15:39.595
In a fire fight on the
road, you've got a few options.

15:39.695 --> 15:41.375
Without something high-caliber,

15:41.475 --> 15:45.190
you're not going to be able to penetrate
the radiator or the firewall behind it.

15:45.290 --> 15:47.005
That leaves two options:

15:47.105 --> 15:51.390
the windshield or ricocheting bullets off
the ground up through the undercarriage,

15:51.490 --> 15:54.180
which is one of the least-reinforced
parts of the car.

15:54.280 --> 15:58.360
For sheer panic, it's hard to beat
bullets coming up from the floorboards.

16:17.970 --> 16:19.680
Is that brake fluid?

16:20.950 --> 16:23.155
Polyethylene glycol's not gonna
burn fast enough to do anything.

16:23.255 --> 16:26.775
It will when it's mixed with chlorine
dioxide and some other stuff.

16:26.875 --> 16:29.340
Someone's been to the
chemical store, I see.

16:47.170 --> 16:49.840
I like you. Have I ever told you that?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.770
Here comes another one.
We got to get out of here.

17:02.620 --> 17:04.815
We're gonna need to
finda parking garage.

17:04.915 --> 17:07.220
We need a new ride.

17:11.839 --> 17:14.105
Carla, not a good time!

17:14.204 --> 17:16.025
- You think you're clever.
- Clever?

17:16.125 --> 17:18.710
Well, I tested well in school, but
they say that doesn't mean --

17:18.810 --> 17:22.035
you're trying to save the
man who tried to kill you.

17:22.135 --> 17:24.020
Victor and I have known each
other for a long time.

17:24.119 --> 17:26.135
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

17:26.234 --> 17:30.205
You know, I know it's been a short time, but sometimes
you meet someone, and you just get that feeling.

17:30.305 --> 17:34.005
Enough. It's time you learned
actions have consequences.

17:34.105 --> 17:37.790
Funny, I was thinking it was time
for you to learn the same thing.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.655
She give you the "actions
have consequences" speech?

17:40.755 --> 17:41.680
Yeah.

17:41.780 --> 17:46.515
As someone who's doled out a lot of those
consequences over the years, she'll go after your family.

17:46.615 --> 17:49.460
That'll be harder than she thinks.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.030
Here. There.

18:16.130 --> 18:19.375
How about this? Two guys, Miami, cute
convertible. Perfect camouflage.

18:19.475 --> 18:23.240
Yeah, I'm looking for something
with a little more horsepower.

18:25.270 --> 18:28.480
Here comes a second car.
This should get interesting.

18:29.140 --> 18:31.535
Madeline, if I knew
more, I would tell you.

18:31.635 --> 18:34.035
So you don't know who these
people are? I mean, you have names.

18:34.135 --> 18:35.135
Can't you just look them up?

18:35.235 --> 18:36.655
That's not how it works.

18:36.755 --> 18:38.870
If somebody's doing
something off the books,

18:38.970 --> 18:42.625
they don't hand out decoder rings
and build a mountain fortress.

18:42.725 --> 18:45.410
So it's Carla and Victor.

18:45.510 --> 18:48.065
And Michael's in trouble with them.

18:48.165 --> 18:49.230
So what does it have to do with me?

18:49.330 --> 18:52.945
It's all a way to get to Mike. You're
somebody he cares about. It's leverage.

18:53.045 --> 18:55.890
Please, I'm not leverage.
You want a beer?

18:57.080 --> 19:00.390
No, Madeline! I don't want a beer.

19:00.760 --> 19:04.585
Okay. This is serious.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.040
That's what I'm trying to say.

19:08.070 --> 19:10.630
I'll get my stuff.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.590
Crap.

19:27.770 --> 19:30.075
Change of plans. Where's your shotgun?

19:30.175 --> 19:32.790
- In the back.
- Go get it, now.

19:38.910 --> 19:41.530
Sam? Sam!

19:42.300 --> 19:44.720
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get down.

19:59.670 --> 20:02.930
I guess this means we're
not going to Disney World.

20:09.970 --> 20:12.865
They're not taking any chances
with the two bad boys in here.

20:12.965 --> 20:15.990
They're doing it right, setting up
a perimeter and waiting for backup.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.500
Well, we should get some
backup of our own.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.620
Careful with that phone. Chances
are, it's a party line now.

20:23.760 --> 20:27.080
Pleasure doing business with you.
Say hi to Paco.

20:27.450 --> 20:28.985
- Bonjour.
- Fi.

20:29.085 --> 20:31.505
Michael, you are not gonna 
believe the deal I got today.

20:31.605 --> 20:34.875
I am better at buying guns than I am at buying
shoes, and I am really good at buying shoes.

20:34.975 --> 20:36.830
- Fiona Glenanne.
- What?

20:37.710 --> 20:41.890
Remember that drive past the
factory where we first met?

20:41.990 --> 20:45.995
Do you think we could do something
similar where we, uh, picnicked last month?

20:46.095 --> 20:47.155
You'll be making this drive soon?

20:47.255 --> 20:49.560
As fast as I can manage.

20:59.530 --> 21:01.575
They're setting upa spike strip.

21:01.675 --> 21:04.420
Oh, this is getting better and better.

21:08.340 --> 21:10.380
I'm not getting Michael or Fiona.

21:10.480 --> 21:11.655
They probably ditched the phones.

21:11.755 --> 21:13.125
- Should I call the police?
- No.

21:13.225 --> 21:14.515
That'll make it way too easy for them.

21:14.615 --> 21:18.190
Cops take us to the station, they know where
we are, and they know that we are unarmed.

21:18.290 --> 21:20.440
So what do we do?
Just sit here and wait?

21:21.110 --> 21:22.385
No, they're gonna get more guys.

21:22.485 --> 21:24.410
We got to create a distraction
and get them out of here.

21:24.510 --> 21:28.455
But the thing is, they're all over my car, and
there's no way to get your car out of the garage.

21:28.555 --> 21:29.890
We could borrow Mrs. Reynolds' car.

21:29.990 --> 21:33.010
She lives over the back fence, and
I have the key in case of emergency.

21:33.110 --> 21:35.725
Back fence, huh? That could work.

21:35.825 --> 21:39.670
Madeline, think you could
find some christmas lights?

21:42.550 --> 21:47.475
When you're outmanned and outgunned, the key
is to appear bigger and stronger than you are.

21:47.575 --> 21:51.170
Take your enemy's expectations
and turn them against him.

21:51.450 --> 21:54.095
To make a good-sized fireball
without a lot of ordnance,

21:54.195 --> 21:58.135
you need a powder with a high
surface-area-to-mass ratio.

21:58.235 --> 22:02.170
Non-dairy creamer mixed
with gunpowder works nicely.

22:15.010 --> 22:17.690
I could probably put twoor three of them
down, get one of their guns on the way out.

22:17.790 --> 22:19.995
We're trying to keep the body
count a little bit lower than that.

22:20.095 --> 22:22.875
This isn't just about getting out of a
parking garage. We might have a shot right now.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.215
I've worked with
Carla for a long time now.

22:24.315 --> 22:27.795
I've put together a little insurance policy
in case she ever found out what I was up to.

22:27.895 --> 22:31.065
- Insurance?
- Yeah, she likes her ops teams for personal errands.

22:31.165 --> 22:33.980
Making extra cash, payback,
that kind of thing.

22:34.080 --> 22:37.335
Now, I've got a file at a safe
house in town. Now, we get that...

22:37.435 --> 22:39.350
we can blackmail our way to safety.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.810
Yeah, it's a distant second to dousing
her in kerosene and lighting a match,

22:41.910 --> 22:43.490
but under the circumstances,
it'll have to do.

22:43.590 --> 22:45.075
Now, are we ready to use this or what?

22:45.175 --> 22:48.750
I think we can get
further with this. Let's go.

22:52.380 --> 22:55.970
A security perimeter is like
a defensive line in football.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.430
You've got a couple of options.

23:02.940 --> 23:06.760
You can try to punch through
the line with brute force...

23:14.510 --> 23:17.855
or you can soften it up
with a little misdirection.

23:17.955 --> 23:19.710
Here they come.

23:20.390 --> 23:22.105
Look out.

23:22.205 --> 23:24.300
Get out of the way!

23:41.660 --> 23:43.295
I'm liking your plan less and less.

23:43.395 --> 23:45.835
Everything's fine, as long as
we keep them behind us.

23:45.935 --> 23:48.430
- Fine?
- Relatively fine.

24:11.740 --> 24:13.940
Come on, Michael.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.720
Where did you meet her?

24:57.740 --> 25:00.185
Blackmail. That's the idea?

25:00.285 --> 25:03.440
We're doing all this so we can
throw some paperwork at Carla?

25:03.960 --> 25:05.895
It's the smart play
here. We're outgunned.

25:05.995 --> 25:06.915
We'll get bigger guns.

25:07.015 --> 25:08.460
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

25:08.560 --> 25:11.480
I saw what she did
to you and your family.

25:11.580 --> 25:14.510
If the file is so great, then
why didn't you use it before?

25:14.960 --> 25:17.035
This isn't just about her.

25:17.135 --> 25:19.250
I want the guys who call the shots.

25:19.350 --> 25:22.835
The file was just in case,
enough to force her to back off.

25:22.935 --> 25:26.245
If this was just about putting a bullet in
Carla, it would have been over a long time ago.

25:26.345 --> 25:29.285
Still, putting a bullet in
Carla sounds awfully good.

25:29.385 --> 25:32.470
If it comes to that,
you'll have to get in line.

25:32.570 --> 25:34.215
Yeah, about that file?

25:34.315 --> 25:36.490
Your safe house - not so safe.

25:39.520 --> 25:44.090
She's good. I was three deep with fake safe
houses trying to keep this place from her.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.570
Sometimes I wish she'd get a hobby.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.310
Which room is it in?

25:48.410 --> 25:50.045
It's not in a room.
It's on the utility pole.

25:50.145 --> 25:53.625
A fake utility box
isn't a bad hiding place.

25:53.725 --> 25:54.150
Oh, nice.

25:54.250 --> 25:56.995
People don't touch things
labeled "high voltage."

25:57.095 --> 25:58.645
Repair crews leave them alone, too.

25:58.745 --> 26:00.985
They're not real, so they
never need servicing.

26:01.085 --> 26:04.480
Too bad Carla'ssurveillance
is parked rightin front of it.

26:05.490 --> 26:08.155
Two cars, four guys.
Think we can handle it.

26:08.255 --> 26:10.565
We each shoot one and
rochambeau for the other.

26:10.665 --> 26:12.785
Yeah, we don't know it's Carla's guys.

26:12.885 --> 26:15.895
It could be ATF, FBI working
off of bad intel.

26:15.995 --> 26:17.120
They could becompletely innocent.

26:17.220 --> 26:19.225
Oh, please. No one's completely innocent.

26:19.325 --> 26:22.020
Is that what you told
yourself when you tried to kill me?

26:22.680 --> 26:24.900
Let's go.

26:32.420 --> 26:33.515
Thanks for calling on star.

26:33.615 --> 26:36.625
Yes, I need directions to
the closest hardware store.

26:36.725 --> 26:40.340
I'd like to avoid major intersections
and government buildings.

26:40.440 --> 26:43.565
I found a hardware store on Siebert
Avenue. Would you like me to direct you?

26:43.665 --> 26:45.480
Yes, please.

26:50.120 --> 26:52.960
Okay. The party's starting.

26:53.800 --> 26:55.565
- You ready?
- Does it matter?

26:55.665 --> 26:57.440
Not really.

27:32.100 --> 27:33.995
Do you think they saw us?

27:34.095 --> 27:37.690
No, they're busy with the team out
front. We're probably good to go.

27:39.560 --> 27:43.340
If I knew that baby was here, I would
have gotten us out of there a lot faster.

27:47.280 --> 27:48.635
- Turn this way?
- Right down here.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.425
Why? Is it a shortcut where we're going?

27:50.525 --> 27:53.105
I'm telling you, I think the idea
sucks. Just pull over in here.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.135
- What, where? Right here?
- Now. Yes.

27:55.235 --> 27:58.440
- Why are we pulling over here?
- Don't ask questions. Just do it, please.

28:00.900 --> 28:03.515
Madeline, you saw what
happened back there, right?

28:03.615 --> 28:04.560
Yeah, I did.

28:04.660 --> 28:07.595
You really think the best use of your
time is a three-hour drive to Orlando?

28:07.695 --> 28:10.055
- Yeah. Do you have a better idea?
- Yeah, I do.

28:10.155 --> 28:13.010
Okay, fine. Well, let's hear your plan.

28:13.620 --> 28:16.875
I take care of myself,
and you go save my son!

28:16.975 --> 28:19.130
They sent men to me with guns, Sam.

28:19.230 --> 28:21.560
God knows what they sent to him.

28:22.130 --> 28:25.485
Listen, the one thing a woman my
age can do in Miami is blend in.

28:25.585 --> 28:29.200
If they can pick me out of 10,000 other
60-something women with bleached-blond hair,

28:29.300 --> 28:31.470
I guess I'm done for, huh?

28:34.160 --> 28:36.140
Can you find him?

28:36.840 --> 28:40.055
Maybe. We got a few rally points around
Miami we use for emergencies.

28:40.155 --> 28:42.585
But come on, Madeline. Are you sure?

28:42.685 --> 28:46.350
He needs you more than I
do, Sam. Just go, please.

28:49.420 --> 28:51.870
Bye, Sam.

28:54.130 --> 28:56.490
Mike's gonna kill me.

29:00.560 --> 29:04.785
One of the most common cover IDs
for a spy is service personnel.

29:04.885 --> 29:09.795
Of course, anyone who works in intelligence
knows to check service personnel.

29:09.895 --> 29:15.140
So a quick phone call to the gas company, and
you've created the perfect distraction.

29:19.860 --> 29:24.705
The active ingredient in pepper
spray is the chemical capsaicin.

29:24.805 --> 29:30.090
Mix the birdseed with some alcohol and
oil, pressurize it in a paint sprayer with co2,

29:31.040 --> 29:33.960
and you have a homemade pepper grenade.

29:35.380 --> 29:40.075
A few nails in the right places
on a car door blocks the lever bar,

29:40.175 --> 29:45.570
making it impossible to open, and leaving
you free to do pretty much whatever you want.

29:58.250 --> 29:59.755
I could see why Carla wouldn't
want this out there.

29:59.855 --> 30:02.510
She'd send a black-ops team to
deal with a parking ticket.

30:02.810 --> 30:03.715
Pretty much.

30:03.815 --> 30:05.610
The higher-ups stay
away from most operations.

30:05.710 --> 30:08.175
They have two rules:
don't screw up, and don't get caught.

30:08.275 --> 30:10.860
They don't get involved
unless things go very, very wrong.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.975
Well, I'd say this situation qualifies.

30:13.075 --> 30:16.695
Carla has a lot of enemiesfrom her
spook days, and she's made more since.

30:16.795 --> 30:19.350
And then she made the mistake of
vouching for you, big guy.

30:19.450 --> 30:22.380
Those files should be more than
enough to earn her a retirement bullet.

30:22.480 --> 30:26.195
Carla's entire work history -
this is pretty damning stuff.

30:26.295 --> 30:27.625
You think you can play this card?

30:27.725 --> 30:31.510
When we get back to my boat, I've got the
codes and comm lines to go above her head.

30:31.610 --> 30:35.605
If she knows I can get to them with
this, then she'llback off - fast.

30:35.705 --> 30:37.925
Then we get out of town, maybe to Cuba.

30:38.025 --> 30:42.675
Fabulous. Great music, lots
of sexy unemployed men.

30:42.775 --> 30:45.080
Fi, can I talk to you for a sec?

30:48.290 --> 30:49.680
I'm not invited to Cuba.

30:49.780 --> 30:51.715
They're gonna follow us
with everything they have.

30:51.815 --> 30:55.310
I need you to find Sam and
help him protect my family.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.520
Can't Sam do it on his own?

30:58.620 --> 31:02.500
I know you don't like to hear
this, but you and Sam are a good team.

31:05.660 --> 31:08.710
- And do you think I...
- The car.

31:09.010 --> 31:12.495
I expect you to bring it back
clean with a full tank. Capisce?

31:12.595 --> 31:15.260
I can do that.

31:23.700 --> 31:27.820
It's not goodbye. It's just... in case.

31:31.760 --> 31:35.270
And that is to remind you to be careful.

32:00.840 --> 32:03.230
Looks like no one's around.

32:03.980 --> 32:06.540
We'll scout the perimeter.
If it's clear, we'll go in.

32:07.290 --> 32:09.800
All this time, you never found
out who burned you?

32:09.900 --> 32:12.030
Who cares? Name in a file.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.915
Behind that, another name.

32:14.015 --> 32:16.235
You know how these things start.
Someone runs an operation off the books.

32:16.335 --> 32:20.375
It's supposed to be a one-time thing, but
when it's over, there's power to be had.

32:20.475 --> 32:22.955
Takes on a life of its own.

32:23.055 --> 32:25.750
It's the organization, not some guy.

32:26.980 --> 32:28.445
Why me?

32:28.545 --> 32:31.520
Don't tell me my name
was picked out of some hat.

32:34.430 --> 32:37.330
It was no secret you
were good at your job.

32:38.800 --> 32:41.725
The machine wanted you, so it took you.

32:41.825 --> 32:45.770
Now you're part of it. 
And I'm part of it.

32:46.070 --> 32:49.060
But that's what we're
trying to destroy here, sport.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.540
Ah, there you are.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.850
I haven't been able to
get anybody on the phone for ages.

33:01.950 --> 33:02.945
Where's Mikey? Is he here?

33:03.045 --> 33:06.475
No. He decided to go on
a trip to Cuba with victor.

33:06.575 --> 33:09.335
They're going after Carla with documents.

33:09.435 --> 33:10.470
What are we supposed to do?

33:10.570 --> 33:13.370
I promised him I'd help
you protect the family.

33:13.470 --> 33:16.205
Well, I promised Madeline
I'd help protect Mike.

33:16.305 --> 33:18.685
So I guess the question is...

33:18.785 --> 33:21.190
which promise do we keep?

33:38.810 --> 33:40.930
Looks like we're all clear.

33:48.760 --> 33:53.165
We have enough fuel to make it to the island, as long
as we don't have to do too much detouring on the way.

33:53.265 --> 33:56.510
You start the engines. I'll cast off.

34:17.530 --> 34:18.815
Carla.

34:18.915 --> 34:20.730
Bad day for a cruise, Michael.

34:20.830 --> 34:22.219
A very, very bad day.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.210
You think so?

34:23.310 --> 34:25.760
And here I was hoping
you came to see us off.

34:25.860 --> 34:30.215
I took the precaution of having the local
marinas searched when I lost contact with Victor.

34:30.315 --> 34:31.905
Seemed like a long shot.

34:32.005 --> 34:35.980
Hated to think my two favorite operatives
might be making nasty little plans together.

34:36.080 --> 34:37.395
Sorry to disappoint you.

34:37.495 --> 34:41.855
Well, not to spoil the fun,
but the boat's wired with c-4.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.989
Can't have you leaving
before we have a chat.

34:44.090 --> 34:47.040
Great. Come on board. Let's talk.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.929
I'm fine here, thanks.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.995
Michael, management's on the way.

34:55.094 --> 34:57.285
They're gonna want to
know what happened here.

34:57.385 --> 35:00.470
Any story I tell them has to
begin with Victor's dead body.

35:00.570 --> 35:03.380
Afraid of what he might share
about your history together?

35:03.480 --> 35:06.955
Not important. What's important
is that this story needs a hero.

35:07.055 --> 35:08.865
It could be you.

35:08.965 --> 35:11.740
Kill him or send him out, and I'll do it.

35:13.290 --> 35:16.275
If you leave me no alternative,
there's always the c-4.

35:16.375 --> 35:18.670
You want to explain
blowing up your entire team?

35:18.770 --> 35:20.605
Doesn't speak well for
your management skills.

35:20.705 --> 35:24.390
Yeah, well, I'd haveto explain two dead
bodies. You'd have to be one of them.

35:24.730 --> 35:28.745
Just end this, Michael!
He's a killer. You know that.

35:28.845 --> 35:31.495
- He's what you made him.
- Time is up, Michael!

35:31.595 --> 35:34.800
Finish it off,
or I will finish it for you!

35:42.400 --> 35:43.665
Finally.

35:43.765 --> 35:46.960
Look, I know you want to savor the
moment, but we got to get out of here.

35:59.080 --> 36:01.980
Looks like whoever's in
that chopper brought some backup.

36:02.570 --> 36:07.300
Standing by for clearance.
Secure your perimeter.

36:07.550 --> 36:09.275
Move it.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.170
They're heading into the trees.

36:15.710 --> 36:18.020
Clear for touchdown.

36:29.900 --> 36:32.280
We got to talk, big guy.

36:35.890 --> 36:40.860
You have to get out there and get
on top of this before her body cools.

36:41.610 --> 36:45.520
Take the file. Tell them when
you found me, I turned on Carla.

36:45.970 --> 36:50.440
You lured her here, had your team
take her out, and then killed me.

36:51.500 --> 36:52.570
Killed you?

36:52.670 --> 36:54.275
It's over.

36:54.375 --> 36:56.260
The only question is...

36:56.360 --> 37:01.520
whether you're a traitor who helped
me or the ace operative who shot me.

37:05.670 --> 37:08.180
Help me out.

37:09.930 --> 37:11.635
I'm dead one way or the other.

37:11.735 --> 37:14.515
They get me alive,
and they're gonna take me apart.

37:14.615 --> 37:17.640
You know it has to be like this.

37:24.900 --> 37:27.460
It was good playing with you, sport.

37:28.790 --> 37:31.700
Now you get out.

37:32.360 --> 37:35.230
Get out while you can.

38:22.040 --> 38:24.415
Hey, there! Took you guys long enough.

38:24.515 --> 38:26.710
Put down the gun.

38:29.610 --> 38:30.985
Want to get those out of my face?

38:31.085 --> 38:33.250
Could have used you guys earlier.

38:34.770 --> 38:37.420
No, this is for the big guy.

38:55.660 --> 38:58.400
*****

39:15.430 --> 39:17.045
Good luck, Mike.

39:17.145 --> 39:20.010
In intelligence work,
your most important tool -

39:20.110 --> 39:23.870
more important than any combat
technique, any technical skill -

39:23.970 --> 39:28.870
is your ability to twist the facts
of a situation to your own advantage.

39:28.970 --> 39:32.490
The worse the facts are,
the more you've got to sell it.

39:32.590 --> 39:34.640
Well...

39:35.050 --> 39:39.175
two rogue operatives in
one day? Lucky us.

39:39.275 --> 39:43.885
You're welcome. You know, I think you
need to talk to the folks in human resources.

39:43.985 --> 39:46.045
You have some staff issues.

39:46.145 --> 39:47.770
I agree completely.

39:47.870 --> 39:50.940
Tell me, Michael, since you
know so much about our problems,

39:51.040 --> 39:54.005
what should I do about
our new recruit, Michael Westen?

39:54.105 --> 39:58.140
Wonderfully effective,
terrifically resourceful,

39:58.240 --> 40:01.335
truly the best I've ever seen,
but he just doesn't seem happy.

40:01.435 --> 40:04.205
Maybe it's the threats
against his family.

40:04.305 --> 40:06.625
Maybe it's the people trying to kill him.

40:06.725 --> 40:11.075
Maybe it's the fact that he had to
use his people to clean up your mess.

40:11.175 --> 40:14.230
- Your operatives-- 
- ...are dead. And you're not.

40:15.570 --> 40:18.385
You've created a job opening, Michael.

40:18.485 --> 40:20.380
And I have to fill it.

40:21.100 --> 40:23.500
Want money? We can do that.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.575
You want to get out of Miami?

40:25.675 --> 40:28.045
I want you people out of my life!

40:28.145 --> 40:29.885
Out of your life?

40:29.985 --> 40:33.035
Tell me, Michael. All your
old enemies from your spy days,

40:33.135 --> 40:37.075
all the people who have scores to
settle with Michael Westen --

40:37.175 --> 40:38.880
where do you think they've been?

40:38.980 --> 40:40.800
Did they just forget about you?

40:40.900 --> 40:43.980
Or has someone been keeping them at bay?

40:44.280 --> 40:46.525
You think you've been under our thumb?

40:46.625 --> 40:49.345
You've been under our
protection. Think about that.

40:49.445 --> 40:50.795
Yeah, I'll be fine, thanks.

40:50.895 --> 40:52.685
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

40:52.785 --> 40:54.150
Tell you what.

40:54.250 --> 40:56.695
We'll leave you alone if that's
what you want. Your family, too.

40:56.795 --> 40:58.920
See how you like it.

40:59.960 --> 41:02.280
You want out?

41:03.180 --> 41:05.615
There's the door.

41:05.715 --> 41:07.150
But hear this:

41:07.250 --> 41:13.130
You have no idea what hell will rain
down if we stop watching out for you.

41:19.580 --> 41:22.290
I'll take my chances.

41:50.580 --> 41:53.685
As a spy working for a
government, you're protected.

41:53.785 --> 41:57.540
You may work solo, but you have
agreements with other spy agencies.

41:57.640 --> 42:01.135
Even when you're surrounded by
your enemies, that protects you.

42:01.235 --> 42:04.010
When your entire career
consists of making enemies,

42:04.110 --> 42:08.490
there's no greater danger than
being totally cut off, alone.

42:17.720 --> 42:21.695
When you find yourself out in the
cold, all you can do is put your head down

42:21.795 --> 42:23.720
and try to survive.
