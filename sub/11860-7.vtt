00:23.542 --> 00:25.417
Hey, Meesha? Donalyn?

00:25.500 --> 00:28.542
I can't wait to
show you your new room.

00:28.625 --> 00:30.125
Kenny painted it himself.

00:30.208 --> 00:32.917
- Right, Kenny?
- Mm-hmm.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.083
Hey, Meesha, you're gonna
love your new school.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.709
It has a swimming pool.

00:37.792 --> 00:40.583
- Yes!
- We don't know how to swim.

00:40.667 --> 00:42.583
Well, you can learn.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.625
Right, Meesha?

00:43.709 --> 00:45.166
Yes, Mrs. Watson.

00:45.250 --> 00:48.542
You don't have to call us
Mr. and Mrs. Watson anymore.

00:48.625 --> 00:53.458
We're family now.
You can call us Alice,
Kenneth.

00:53.542 --> 00:55.917
- Mom and Dad.
- We already got a mom and dad.

01:00.125 --> 01:02.125
We're gonna set
some rules.

01:02.208 --> 01:05.500
(Kenneth)
'Curfew's 7
on school nights'

01:05.583 --> 01:06.959
8 on weekends.

01:07.041 --> 01:09.625
Those streetlights cut
on,
y'all in the house.

01:09.709 --> 01:11.542
Hey, Meesha, look over there.

01:14.959 --> 01:16.625
(Kenneth)
'Donalyn, roll up your
window.'

01:44.834 --> 01:47.166
Donalyn, do you hear me?

01:47.250 --> 01:49.250
I don't want you
hangin' on that
corner.

02:35.834 --> 02:39.166
My 11 year old daughter
died last week.

02:39.250 --> 02:40.959
Brain aneurysm.

02:41.041 --> 02:42.583
Sorry about your loss.

02:42.667 --> 02:45.709
That girl they found in
the landfill back in '91..

02:45.792 --> 02:47.917
- Donalyn Sullivan.
- Yeah.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.709
I tell you what I did.

02:49.792 --> 02:52.417
I get to go to
my daughter's funeral?

02:52.500 --> 02:55.000
Depends on what you got.

02:55.083 --> 02:58.083
I found her dead
in the basement of my club.

02:58.166 --> 03:01.375
- When was this?
- November 18th.

03:01.458 --> 03:04.041
The morning after
my 27th birthday party.

03:04.125 --> 03:05.667
We were having
some plumbing done.

03:06.917 --> 03:09.250
Might have got hit
with one of them pipes.

03:09.333 --> 03:11.000
Might've?

03:11.083 --> 03:12.500
What'd you do with her body?

03:15.542 --> 03:17.625
I wrapped it in this
zebra rug I had.

03:17.709 --> 03:21.375
Put her in the Dumpster
behind Checkers on 29th.

03:22.959 --> 03:25.041
So you find a
dead
girl in your
club...

03:25.125 --> 03:28.166
you toss her body in a Dumpster
instead of calling the cops?

03:28.250 --> 03:30.709
I ran with the
26th Street Villains.

03:30.792 --> 03:32.542
If they'd caught me
talking to some cops

03:32.625 --> 03:34.583
I would have been six deep.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.792
What's a 14 year old girl
doing there in the first
place?

03:36.875 --> 03:39.417
Wild night.
Could have snuck in.

03:41.834 --> 03:43.667
Now I know what her
parents must have felt..

03:44.875 --> 03:46.250
...losing a child.

03:48.458 --> 03:51.208
- I want to do what's right.
- 18 years too late.

03:53.375 --> 03:56.125
Funeral home's holding
my daughter's body.

03:56.208 --> 03:57.875
My wife is waiting for me.

04:00.041 --> 04:02.291
You said it was your
birthday party, right?

04:02.375 --> 04:04.041
I'm gonna need names.

04:09.208 --> 04:12.000
Club was abandoned in '97.

04:12.083 --> 04:14.417
The city's got ownership now.

04:14.500 --> 04:18.166
Hmm, your tax
dollars at work.

04:18.250 --> 04:22.041
The ME's office confirmed
Donalyn was hit with an
object.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.125
"About one inch round."

04:25.208 --> 04:27.583
I found a permit for
a plumbing overhaul back in
'91.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.333
Replaced lead
pipes
with galvanized.

04:29.417 --> 04:32.625
'Detectives.
Blood spatter on the pipe.'

04:39.583 --> 04:41.333
- Let's cut that section
out.
- Yes, miss.

04:41.417 --> 04:43.125
Perfectly good
murder weapon.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.834
I'm guessing Sticky
didn't have a permit for
that.

05:24.125 --> 05:26.542
Donalyn Sullivan.
14 year old foster
kid.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.375
Biological parents both dead.

05:28.458 --> 05:29.875
She and her
little sister Meesha

05:29.959 --> 05:33.041
moved in with Kenneth
and Alice Watson, April '91.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.667
Fourth foster
family in 5
years.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.709
Seven months later,
she's dead in a
landfill.

05:37.792 --> 05:38.917
Assigned searched for predators.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.333
No recent rapes
or regular pervs.

05:41.417 --> 05:43.375
Foster dad alibied out.

05:43.458 --> 05:45.500
In Baltimore with a friend
the night Donalyn went
missing.

05:45.583 --> 05:47.458
Foster mom was at home
with the younger sister.

05:47.542 --> 05:50.083
Donalyn sneaks out,
goes to Sticky's
party.

05:50.166 --> 05:53.417
Next morning, foster mom
files a missing persons.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.583
It's three weeks before her
body's discovered at the dump.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.083
Hey, look who's
back from the
dead.

06:00.166 --> 06:01.625
Would of had a
to-do
with some notice.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.959
I thought I'd be hanging with
the zombies till retirement.

06:04.041 --> 06:05.542
Still don't know
how you did it, boss.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.667
Uh, I still got some
juice upstairs, I
guess.

06:07.750 --> 06:09.417
Glad to have you back, Kat.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.291
ME's report.
Piping in Sticky's basement

06:12.375 --> 06:14.458
fits the thread pattern
on Donalyn's skull.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.792
Blood type's a match, too.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.375
Two items found
on the victim...

06:17.458 --> 06:18.792
'Picture of
her biological mother'

06:18.875 --> 06:20.417
and a busted audio tape.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.542
I'll take it
to the sound hounds.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.041
See if they can
work their magic.

06:23.125 --> 06:24.875
Let's bring in the
foster parents and the sister

06:24.959 --> 06:27.125
see if Sticky's club
jogs their memories.

06:27.208 --> 06:28.625
You got it, boss.

06:30.667 --> 06:32.041
- Hey, Nick.
- Hmm?

06:32.125 --> 06:35.291
Still waiting on that
doctor's report from you.

06:35.375 --> 06:36.959
Thought that was more
of an optional thing.

06:37.041 --> 06:39.083
Only if you opt
to wear the badge.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.625
I haven't seen
a doctor since
1980.

06:41.709 --> 06:43.625
- I don't even have one.
- Then find one.

06:49.458 --> 06:51.500
I don't believe it. I..

06:51.583 --> 06:54.291
Donalyn wasn't the type
of girl to go clubbing'.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.208
More of a homebody?

06:56.291 --> 06:58.834
She just wasn't
all that social.

06:58.917 --> 07:01.125
She spent most of her
time watching her sister.

07:01.208 --> 07:03.917
Got a guest list from
Sticky's club that night.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.375
Recognize any names?

07:05.458 --> 07:07.000
Friends of Donalyn's, maybe?

07:07.083 --> 07:10.667
If she had friends,
I-I didn't know any of them.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.917
Told the girls to stay
away
from those kids on 26th.

07:15.417 --> 07:16.667
(Nick)
'You mean the
kids at school?'

07:16.750 --> 07:18.875
These kids couldn't
<i>school.</i>

07:18.959 --> 07:20.583
Told cops back in '91

07:20.667 --> 07:22.834
you were in Baltimore,
night Donalyn disappeared.

07:22.917 --> 07:25.500
With my pal,
James McDonald. Fishing.

07:25.583 --> 07:28.500
- You still got his number?
- Somewhere.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.000
When'd you come back home?

07:30.083 --> 07:32.375
As soon as Alice called,
said Donalyn was missing.

07:32.458 --> 07:35.625
- She ever run away before?
- Not that I know of.

07:35.709 --> 07:37.333
But Donalyn was a teenager.

07:37.417 --> 07:39.834
- Had a mind of her own.
- She give Alice trouble?

07:39.917 --> 07:42.333
Told Alice those girls
didn't need sympathy.

07:42.417 --> 07:43.542
They needed discipline.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.333
You ever disciplined
them, Kenneth?

07:45.417 --> 07:47.875
Alice got mad
if I raised my voice.

07:47.959 --> 07:51.041
Didn't let me smoke
anymore.
Had all kind of rules.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.375
How was your relationship
with Donalyn?

07:53.458 --> 07:55.208
I was gone a lot for work.

07:55.291 --> 07:57.208
Did what I could
when I was around.

07:57.291 --> 07:59.041
I took her to see
<i>Phantom of the Opera</i>

07:59.125 --> 08:01.542
in New York once.

08:01.625 --> 08:02.709
She liked that.

08:02.792 --> 08:04.917
You and Alice divorced in '92?

08:05.959 --> 08:07.875
Losing a child like that..

08:07.959 --> 08:10.083
...it just ripped us apart.

08:10.166 --> 08:12.875
Well, Ken being away
two foster kids, huh..

08:12.959 --> 08:13.875
...it must have been rough.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.625
Life of a trucker's wife.

08:15.709 --> 08:17.500
Might as well have been
a single mother.

08:17.583 --> 08:19.917
You and Donalyn get along?

08:20.000 --> 08:22.417
Tried to create
a family for her.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.083
Girl was mad at the world.

08:24.166 --> 08:27.917
Her mother was an addict.
Died of AIDS. No father.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.417
A tough life for a kid.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.417
I was a first time foster mom.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.875
Thought I could
change the world.

08:33.959 --> 08:35.750
But what they say is true.

08:35.834 --> 08:37.250
It's harder
with the older ones.

08:49.625 --> 08:51.125
Meesh, I'm Queen Latifah.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.542
- No, don't stop.
- What does she want?

09:03.625 --> 09:05.375
Come on, you guys, keep going.

09:05.458 --> 09:07.250
Nah, ma'am.
I got
homework.

09:09.333 --> 09:12.458
Hey, Donalyn, what
do you say tomorrow

09:12.542 --> 09:15.333
we have a girls' day?

09:15.417 --> 09:17.458
Maybe, we could go shopping..

09:17.542 --> 09:20.834
...get our nails done?
Whatever you want.

09:20.917 --> 09:23.750
Please, Donalyn?

09:23.834 --> 09:27.041
What do you say?
Give me a chance?

09:28.500 --> 09:30.917
Maybe?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.583
I'll do it for
the drama queen.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.083
Okay.

09:40.125 --> 09:41.375
Hey there, precious.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.792
I took what I could get.

09:45.875 --> 09:48.041
So Donalyn was close
with her younger
sister?

09:48.125 --> 09:50.500
- Best friends.
- Is that Meesha?

09:50.583 --> 09:55.000
Yes, convinced DHS to let her
live with me after Donalyn
died.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.959
Adopted her in '95.

09:57.041 --> 09:59.250
She's a doctor
at Children's now.

10:06.041 --> 10:08.166
You're reopening
my sister's case?

10:08.250 --> 10:09.917
After all this time?
I don't understand.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.083
Got a new lead.

10:11.166 --> 10:12.875
You ever hear of
Sticky's on 26th?

10:12.959 --> 10:15.750
Club was owned by
Virgil "Sticky"
Jones.

10:15.834 --> 10:17.000
Yeah.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.041
She'd sneak up there
whenever she could.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.834
Is that where
she was killed?

10:22.917 --> 10:24.667
I thought she ran away.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.750
You, uh, recognize
any of these names?

10:27.834 --> 10:29.375
How'd she get
out of the house?

10:29.458 --> 10:30.792
Just went out the back door.

10:30.875 --> 10:33.500
You ever tell your parents
about Donalyn's night life?

10:33.583 --> 10:35.709
I wanted a
family,
Donalyn didn't.

10:35.792 --> 10:37.875
After she left..

10:37.959 --> 10:41.291
...after I thought she left
all I had was my mother.

10:41.375 --> 10:42.375
What about Kenneth?

10:42.458 --> 10:44.083
Never saw him
after they divorced.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.917
He was never
much around, anyway.

10:46.625 --> 10:49.208
'Wait, Zen.'

10:49.291 --> 10:50.542
I remember him.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.041
Friend of Donalyn's?

10:52.125 --> 10:53.458
I wouldn't go that far.

10:53.542 --> 10:55.750
We met him the first
week
in the neighborhood.

10:57.208 --> 10:58.917
He messed with
the wrong new
girl.

12:04.834 --> 12:06.667
You funny, right?

12:06.750 --> 12:08.667
This is my street, bitch.

12:10.542 --> 12:13.667
26. We never forget.

12:13.750 --> 12:16.375
I see you again,
gonna earn my bones.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.667
(Donalyn)
'Come on, Meesh.'

12:30.041 --> 12:32.333
I always thought
she was fearless..

12:32.417 --> 12:34.041
...but she was
just a little girl.

12:35.208 --> 12:36.750
Zen was
a 26th Street Villain?

12:36.834 --> 12:39.125
Heard he shot a guy
for his Jordans.

12:39.208 --> 12:40.834
Happen to know
his real name?

12:40.917 --> 12:44.041
Yeah, I think Zeb Edwards.

12:45.625 --> 12:46.875
Thanks, Meesha.

12:48.834 --> 12:50.959
You'll let me know
if you find anything,
right?

12:53.959 --> 12:55.208
Alright.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.125
So, Zeb and Sticky
were 26ers.

12:59.208 --> 13:03.041
Well, maybe Zeb ran into
Donalyn at the birthday
party.

13:03.125 --> 13:05.542
Got back at her over
that "little issue" of
his.

13:18.750 --> 13:22.458
- Zen?
- Just Zeb now.

13:22.542 --> 13:23.959
Yeah, Zeb Edwards.

13:24.041 --> 13:25.542
Popped in '92
for agg assault

13:25.625 --> 13:28.750
'93 criminal conspiracy,
'94 possession with intent.

13:28.834 --> 13:30.375
People say this and that.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.875
But 26ers never forget.

13:32.959 --> 13:36.500
What you told Donalyn Sullivan
after she outspit you on 26th.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.458
Come on. I changed.

13:38.542 --> 13:40.709
Look, I'm a family man now.

13:43.291 --> 13:45.709
Were you at Sticky's
birthday party in '91?

13:45.792 --> 13:47.625
Nah, it wasn't me.

13:47.709 --> 13:49.875
Why were you on the
guest list, Zen?

13:49.959 --> 13:52.291
Start talkin' straight,
or I take out the bracelets.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.083
- What you wanna know?
- The night Donalyn was
killed.

13:56.166 --> 13:57.375
You two still beefin'?

13:57.458 --> 13:59.417
Nah, me and Sugar Dawn,
we was friends by then.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.417
- Sugar Dawn?
- It's the name I gave her.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.667
So, what kinda friendship you
have with a 14 year old girl?

14:03.750 --> 14:06.709
Nah, it wasn't like that.
I was her manager.

14:08.083 --> 14:11.333
Yeah, I turned her
into a bona fide MC.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.333
Back then,
you either was a talent

14:13.417 --> 14:14.709
or you found the talent.

14:16.125 --> 14:17.250
Alright, look,
you wanna do this

14:17.333 --> 14:19.542
you gotta look
the part, alright?

14:19.625 --> 14:21.375
Here, put this..

14:21.458 --> 14:22.750
Damn! Not like
I'm gonna hit you.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.625
I can do it myself.

14:24.709 --> 14:26.667
(Zen)
'Alright, where the earrings
and the ring I got you?'

14:26.750 --> 14:27.917
You gotta put 'em on.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.041
'Put your rings on.'

14:41.750 --> 14:43.000
Is it cool?

14:43.083 --> 14:46.834
- Put the hat on.
- Cool?

14:48.709 --> 14:50.959
(Zen)
'Ah!'

14:53.166 --> 14:55.750
Ah, now there she go.

14:55.834 --> 14:57.834
'That's Sugar Dawn.
Let's roll.'

15:05.583 --> 15:06.959
(Zen)
'Yo, Huxtable.'

15:07.041 --> 15:08.625
Zen, get the little
girl outta here.

15:08.709 --> 15:11.583
Yo, she's dope, man.
She got mad skills.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.834
Hey, you was
on 26th and Sergeant

15:14.917 --> 15:16.625
first day me and my sister
moved over there.

15:16.709 --> 15:21.083
Yo, Sugar Dawn, go ahead
and spit that 16 real quick.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.959
Yeah, yeah. I got it.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.709
Yo, I'm tellin' you, man.

15:40.792 --> 15:42.667
She's gonna be
the next Antoinette.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.208
She just another girl
on 26th thinks she can rap.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.542
<i>Go Tell It</i>
on the Mountain

15:57.125 --> 15:59.375
(Zen)
'Ooh!'

16:00.458 --> 16:01.917
I know I can rap.

16:07.375 --> 16:10.166
Alright, you can stay.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.875
Man, the only reason why
y'all lovin' her

16:13.959 --> 16:17.166
is 'cause she's still
in diapers. She a baby MC.

16:17.250 --> 16:20.875
I mean, she look like me,
y'all got her rappin' like
me..

16:20.959 --> 16:22.667
...but she ain't me.

16:22.750 --> 16:26.208
Oh, I don't know. I think she
got you there, Big Soph.

16:26.959 --> 16:28.083
Who, her?

16:28.166 --> 16:29.667
Man, get your
finger outta my
face.

16:29.750 --> 16:31.208
I know that's not
what just happened!

16:31.291 --> 16:32.834
I know you didn't
just disrespect me like
that!

16:32.917 --> 16:34.542
You know, you better
watch your back.

16:34.625 --> 16:38.208
Don't let me catch your ass
on 26th, 'cause I got you!

16:44.291 --> 16:47.041
I should've protected
Sugar Dawn more.

16:47.125 --> 16:48.417
Big Soph was crazy.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.917
She at Sticky's party
that night?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.959
Yeah, she got a big
recording contract.

16:53.041 --> 16:55.291
Sugar Dawn was supposed
to spit for a contract too

16:55.375 --> 16:57.542
but she never showed.

16:58.458 --> 16:59.917
Yeah. Yeah, it was the night

17:00.000 --> 17:02.083
the Phillies ended
the game on that triple play.

17:02.166 --> 17:03.792
You remember who was
workin' the parking lot?

17:05.041 --> 17:07.458
Wait. Last name Parker?

17:08.917 --> 17:10.542
Emil Parker.

17:12.375 --> 17:13.834
He'll be back Saturday?

17:14.875 --> 17:16.291
Alright, thanks.

17:18.709 --> 17:20.542
So, any luck with the
foster father's alibi?

17:20.625 --> 17:23.291
Oh, number Ken gave us
for James McDonald was

17:23.375 --> 17:25.000
disconnected back in '97.

17:25.083 --> 17:27.417
Ran down the forwarding number.
There's no answer.

17:27.500 --> 17:32.291
Uh, where's mine?

17:32.375 --> 17:33.792
I thought you gave up the cow.

17:33.875 --> 17:36.792
I'm gone a couple weeks and
all of a sudden I'm
vegetarian?

17:38.542 --> 17:41.875
Mm! AV department
was able to save

17:41.959 --> 17:44.291
part of Donalyn's audiotape.
Listen.

17:53.709 --> 17:55.417
<i>♪ Every single new year ♪♪</i>

17:55.500 --> 17:57.750
AV's trying to rescue
the rest of the tape.

17:57.834 --> 18:00.875
And I've been harassing DHS
to open Donalyn's file.

18:00.959 --> 18:03.875
Know a gal over there.
I'll, uh, reach out.

18:03.959 --> 18:06.000
Pretty heavy lyrics
for a 14 year old.

18:06.083 --> 18:07.917
Veronica's around
Donalyn's age.

18:09.291 --> 18:11.959
I can't imagine her
going through any of this.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.542
Thanks, Scotty.

18:20.375 --> 18:21.709
We got the big guns.

18:21.792 --> 18:24.875
The lieutenant and
the lady detective.
Mm-mm.

18:24.959 --> 18:27.166
You deserve special
treatment being the voice

18:27.250 --> 18:29.208
of Philly Hip-Hop on Radio 99.

18:29.291 --> 18:30.667
And I'm on in 45.

18:30.750 --> 18:34.000
Looks like you're gonna
miss drive time, Big Soph.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.709
Police harassin' another
person
of color's, no big surprise.

18:36.792 --> 18:39.500
Ah, a couple of Philly
cops don't scare you.

18:39.583 --> 18:42.417
Especially since you're
so good with a razor blade.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.417
Served three years
at Muncy for assault.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.709
Bitch had it comin'.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.208
You call me in for
somethin' that happened

18:47.291 --> 18:48.792
a hundred years ago?

18:48.875 --> 18:50.750
Remember Donalyn Sullivan?

18:50.834 --> 18:52.834
Maybe you know her
as Sugar Dawn?

18:54.291 --> 18:55.875
Yeah, I remember Sugar Dawn.

18:57.291 --> 19:00.041
Yeah, me-me and
Baby MC, we was cool.

19:00.125 --> 19:02.375
- You ever threaten her?
- She was a kid.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.000
Didn't tell her
to watch her back?

19:04.083 --> 19:05.709
Heat of the moment, maybe.

19:05.792 --> 19:07.208
Uh, you got signed with

19:07.291 --> 19:09.417
Killadelphia
Entertainment in '91.

19:09.500 --> 19:10.667
Did.

19:13.625 --> 19:14.709
What's your point?

19:14.792 --> 19:17.166
You got your big break
at Sticky's on 26th.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.417
At his birthday party, so?

19:18.500 --> 19:21.000
Same night and place
Sugar Dawn was murdered.

19:21.083 --> 19:22.417
See where we're going now?

19:22.500 --> 19:25.208
Like I said, I didn't see her.

19:25.291 --> 19:27.375
Donalyn was there
to audition that night, too.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.041
She's dead, you're famous.
Do the math.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.542
Look, Sugar Dawn was
on 26th with the big dogs

19:32.625 --> 19:34.500
but she was still wet
behind the ears.

19:35.417 --> 19:37.750
I tried to help!

19:42.000 --> 19:43.667
Oh, you like rap music?

19:44.834 --> 19:47.500
- Hey.
- Lemme get that, Rocket.

19:47.583 --> 19:49.166
- Hey, man.
- Nah, uh.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.041
Yo, Baby MC, come here.

19:54.667 --> 19:57.250
For real, come here. I ain't
gonna do nothin', alright?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.834
How much you selling '
your tapes for?

20:01.917 --> 20:03.208
A Hamilton.

20:03.291 --> 20:05.208
You buggin', right?

20:05.291 --> 20:07.375
- Zen didn't tell me how much.
- Alright, check this.

20:07.458 --> 20:09.417
Look at homeboy over there
in the fake Karl Kani's.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.959
You ask him for ten,
he gonna shut you down.

20:12.041 --> 20:13.458
That's a five dollar brother.

20:13.542 --> 20:15.083
So you only charge people

20:15.166 --> 20:18.375
what you think
they'll pay, see?

20:18.458 --> 20:20.917
And another thing, you
wanna take all this off.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.375
All what off?

20:22.458 --> 20:25.917
All that jewelry, unless you
trying to get jacked out here.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.875
Trying to look
like Big Soph and all.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.667
Come on.

20:35.542 --> 20:37.709
You still in diapers,
so make it work.

20:38.792 --> 20:40.583
Never ask more
than $15, alright?

20:41.834 --> 20:43.375
Go do it.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.875
Go on. Go ahead.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.333
- Hey, man, you like hip-hop?
- Yeah.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.667
Come on. Okay.

20:55.834 --> 20:57.917
Ah! Told you!

21:06.583 --> 21:08.000
Where's my money?

21:09.750 --> 21:11.583
- What money?
- From your studio time.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.542
- Zen said he'd front it.
- Well, he didn't.

21:15.375 --> 21:18.166
- Huxtable, she's just a kid.
- Is anybody talking to you?

21:19.333 --> 21:21.041
I got $20.

21:21.125 --> 21:23.542
I could page Zen and see
if he can bring some more.

21:23.625 --> 21:26.208
No, we're gonna
find him together.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.500
Get in.
Get in the damn
car!

21:37.500 --> 21:40.041
Huxtable was serious
about his paper.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.917
That was the last time
I saw Sugar Dawn.

21:45.333 --> 21:46.542
When was that?

21:46.625 --> 21:48.500
Two days before Sticky's party.

21:57.750 --> 21:58.625
Oh.

21:58.709 --> 22:00.333
That thing we talked about.

22:06.250 --> 22:08.250
Happy anniversary.

22:19.333 --> 22:21.083
Some guys bring flowers.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.417
A dozen roses ain't got
nothing on six hollow points.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.875
You know I
already
got a piece.

22:24.959 --> 22:26.250
Yeah, but..

22:26.333 --> 22:28.500
...yours comes with too
many questions attached.

22:28.583 --> 22:30.458
Still I think I
could take it
back?

22:30.542 --> 22:34.375
Get some diamond
studs? Real ones?

22:35.834 --> 22:37.875
No refunds, no exchanges.

22:37.959 --> 22:41.208
- Also, completely
untraceable.
- Seriously, Eddie.

22:41.291 --> 22:43.917
Look, you asked me what
I'd do in your situation.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.458
A guy like that?

22:46.625 --> 22:48.041
Well..

22:48.834 --> 22:50.208
...just be careful.

22:53.834 --> 22:55.166
You been under too long.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.834
Maybe things start
looking
kind of cloudy, huh?

22:56.917 --> 22:58.792
Couldn't be clearer
from where I'm standing.

22:58.875 --> 23:00.417
Scum out there
wants you dead.

23:01.375 --> 23:02.792
I'm just evening the odds.

23:02.875 --> 23:06.625
Look, I told you before.
I don't need protecting.

23:07.709 --> 23:09.667
Well, the beauty
of a thing like this

23:09.750 --> 23:12.000
is you can put it away.
Forget about it.

23:13.375 --> 23:15.959
Unless the time comes
when you need it.

23:16.041 --> 23:17.125
Then you decide
where you stand.

23:17.208 --> 23:18.709
I already know where I stand.

23:21.375 --> 23:23.083
I'm just looking out, okay?

23:26.208 --> 23:27.583
Diamonds, huh?

23:30.792 --> 23:32.041
Wait.

23:34.667 --> 23:37.041
Let me think about it. Okay?

23:55.583 --> 23:57.458
Huxtable, huh?

23:57.542 --> 23:58.875
Whatever happened
to good old street names

23:58.959 --> 24:00.667
like Chicken Legs
and Fat Head?

24:00.750 --> 24:02.291
Who's asking?

24:05.291 --> 24:06.583
What can I do
for you, detectives?

24:06.667 --> 24:08.834
Mortuary playlist,
his idea or yours?

24:08.917 --> 24:10.875
Oh. Keeps the mind active.

24:10.959 --> 24:12.709
Family business here
is a long way away from

24:12.792 --> 24:14.750
that one-bedroom music
studio you used to run.

24:14.834 --> 24:17.500
I'm still in the scene.
I find underground talent.

24:17.583 --> 24:19.000
Post their songs
on my blog.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.750
You know
a Donalyn
Sullivan?

24:20.834 --> 24:21.917
Sure.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.583
She was a friend of mine.

24:23.667 --> 24:25.208
Remember her taking
a ride in your
Cherokee?

24:25.291 --> 24:27.959
November '91?
Just you and
her?

24:28.041 --> 24:29.542
- What are you getting at?
- Is that a yes?

24:29.625 --> 24:30.792
Look, she was a little girl.

24:30.875 --> 24:32.500
Got an eyewitness,
saw you throw that

24:32.583 --> 24:35.291
little girl in your
Cherokee,
take off down Broad Street.

24:35.375 --> 24:37.125
Okay, the whole
neighborhood knew

24:37.208 --> 24:38.709
my family owned
this mortuary.

24:38.792 --> 24:41.208
They knew I had money.
Had to show them I was hard.

24:41.291 --> 24:43.917
Jack and Jill kid
looking
for some street cred.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.875
Had to play the game.
We both did.

24:48.834 --> 24:50.083
What were you doing
at Broad Street, anyway?

24:50.166 --> 24:51.458
You know it's dangerous
this time of night.

24:51.542 --> 24:52.542
What do you care where I'm at?

24:52.625 --> 24:53.792
Hey, everybody's
not out to take

24:53.875 --> 24:55.291
something from you,
little sister.

24:55.375 --> 24:57.834
Well you want your money,
so there. That's all I got.

24:57.917 --> 24:59.542
Zen shouldn't
have you out there.

24:59.625 --> 25:00.834
I can take care of myself.

25:00.917 --> 25:03.083
I got something for you.
Back seat.

25:07.917 --> 25:10.083
"James Baldwin.
Go Tell It on the Mountain."

25:10.166 --> 25:12.792
- I already read it.
- I don't doubt it.

25:12.875 --> 25:14.542
'I knew you were different.'

25:14.625 --> 25:16.834
Don't need Zen turning you
into one of Big Soph's
clones.

25:16.917 --> 25:18.750
Shoot, she ain't
got nothing on me.

25:18.834 --> 25:20.834
Your single sucks.

25:20.917 --> 25:23.250
- Did you write it?
- Zen.

25:23.333 --> 25:25.917
- That figures. It's
trivial.
- Trivial sells.

25:26.000 --> 25:27.792
How many tapes you sold today?

25:31.542 --> 25:33.291
Huh?

25:33.375 --> 25:35.583
You got more inside you.
Spit about something real.

25:35.667 --> 25:37.667
Not some cliche
ghetto nursery rhyme.

25:37.750 --> 25:38.959
Oh, like you, college boy?

25:39.041 --> 25:40.333
Fronting like your
mommy and daddy

25:40.417 --> 25:42.125
ain't paying for your
apartment on Chestnut.

25:42.208 --> 25:45.125
But I don't have
what you got.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.083
You're more than
just another MC, Donalyn.

25:47.166 --> 25:48.959
Everybody's got dreams.
Don't mean nothin'.

25:49.041 --> 25:50.917
The difference is,
you got talent.

25:51.917 --> 25:53.458
'And you're smart.'

25:54.834 --> 25:57.041
How old are you?

25:57.125 --> 25:58.667
14 and a half.

25:58.750 --> 26:00.917
[laughing]
"And a half."

26:01.667 --> 26:03.125
What's that mean?

26:05.208 --> 26:08.000
Maybe you should just be 14.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.000
Let the half
take care of itself.

26:11.834 --> 26:13.875
- Yeah.
- 'Yeah.'

26:13.959 --> 26:15.625
Maybe.

26:19.458 --> 26:21.959
Hey, can you pull over
at that pay phone for a
minute?

26:22.041 --> 26:23.458
Yeah, um...

26:24.875 --> 26:26.583
I guess
I got through to her.

26:26.667 --> 26:27.834
Cost her her life, though.

26:27.917 --> 26:30.375
- Who'd Donalyn call?
- Zen.

26:31.250 --> 26:32.500
She fired him right there.

26:33.458 --> 26:34.834
How'd he take that?

26:34.917 --> 26:36.250
He was a 26er.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.834
So, how do you think
he took it?

26:38.917 --> 26:40.959
My father and I
prepared her for burial.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.834
I hardly recognized her.

26:49.250 --> 26:52.291
Said you turned Sugar Dawn
into a bona fide MC.

26:52.375 --> 26:56.583
Before me, she was just
another girl roasting on
26th.

26:56.667 --> 26:58.792
But Sugar Dawn was looking
to change her image.

26:58.875 --> 27:00.250
But she never told me.

27:00.333 --> 27:03.458
But she wanted to rap about
more than cars and jewelry.

27:03.542 --> 27:05.542
She'd rap about a
dog
if I told her.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.417
Sugar Dawn dropped you, Zen.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.709
Please. I put
her on the
map.

27:10.792 --> 27:12.625
Well, the neighborhood map.

27:12.709 --> 27:14.166
But she wanted more.

27:14.250 --> 27:16.166
14 and she already outgrew you.

27:16.250 --> 27:18.458
A 26er like you wasn't
just gonna take that.

27:18.542 --> 27:20.583
Told you, I had
nothing to do
with

27:20.667 --> 27:22.375
what happened to Sugar Dawn.

27:22.458 --> 27:24.583
Y'all just be wanting to have
the brothers all gripped up.

27:24.667 --> 27:26.333
You'll be gripping
20 years in Graterford

27:26.417 --> 27:28.625
you don't drop that
attitude and come clean.

27:32.208 --> 27:34.041
Okay.

27:34.125 --> 27:35.917
She fired me, alright?

27:36.000 --> 27:37.875
But that lasted
about half a second.

27:39.291 --> 27:43.083
Hey, Sugar Dawn. Hey.

27:43.166 --> 27:45.709
We on 10:50 a.m.!

27:45.792 --> 27:48.709
I know it's only a Indie
station, but it's something.

27:55.500 --> 27:57.625
Yo, we on the radio!

27:58.917 --> 28:00.792
Alright, so look,
Sticky's birthday party

28:00.875 --> 28:03.375
is tomorrow night, right?
Everybody's gonna be
there.

28:03.458 --> 28:04.917
Now one of Sticky's
boys
promised me

28:05.000 --> 28:07.500
a one-on-one with
Killadelphia
Entertainment.

28:07.583 --> 28:09.000
You do "Goin' Off."

28:10.875 --> 28:12.792
I don't want to do "Goin' Off."

28:12.875 --> 28:14.417
What you talking
about?
That's your single.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.333
I'm saying I want to do
one of my own songs, Zen.

28:16.417 --> 28:17.792
Spit about something real.

28:17.875 --> 28:21.792
Aw, you playin', D, right?
Come on, man, you're killing
me.

28:21.875 --> 28:23.417
I'm serious.

28:23.500 --> 28:26.667
Oh, what, you on some old Negro
spiritual now from Huxtable?

28:26.750 --> 28:28.208
Man, people
don't
dance to that.

28:28.291 --> 28:30.083
Maybe I just want
them to listen.

28:34.583 --> 28:37.208
What do you know
about life?

28:37.291 --> 28:38.500
Nothing.

29:00.917 --> 29:02.417
What Phantom?

29:16.875 --> 29:18.542
What are you
talking about,
D?

29:18.625 --> 29:20.500
I do my song or I'm out.

29:20.583 --> 29:22.083
That's what I'm talking about.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.834
Girl blew me away
with that song.

29:32.917 --> 29:34.709
Do you know who she
was talking about?

29:34.792 --> 29:37.166
Only heard the first verse.

29:37.250 --> 29:39.083
Next night at Sticky's party..

29:39.166 --> 29:40.792
...I waited for her backstage.

29:41.667 --> 29:42.750
She never showed.

29:42.834 --> 29:44.291
Anyone verify that?

29:45.375 --> 29:46.917
I got some names.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.041
She was like
a little sister to me, man.

29:57.291 --> 29:59.667
If I'd have known
she was in trouble..

29:59.750 --> 30:01.959
...I would have done
anything to protect her.

30:07.375 --> 30:08.750
You need to do
what you need to do.

30:08.834 --> 30:11.083
I'm going
to put you on blast, okay?

30:14.625 --> 30:16.166
Oh.

30:16.250 --> 30:18.500
I-I wasn't expecting you.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.208
I got to work late.

30:20.291 --> 30:22.083
Just wanted to drop by.

30:22.792 --> 30:24.166
Everything copacetic?

30:24.959 --> 30:26.834
Sit down.

30:26.917 --> 30:28.834
We about
to have "the talk"?

30:32.291 --> 30:35.041
Uh, this thing that
you
did the other night.

30:35.125 --> 30:37.583
The gift I gave you?

30:37.667 --> 30:40.125
- You didn't have to.
- No. I wanted to.

30:40.208 --> 30:43.041
I'm saying, I
like
you either way.

30:43.125 --> 30:45.125
I don't need any
grand gestures.

30:46.583 --> 30:47.917
Okay.

30:49.667 --> 30:52.792
Whatever my problems
are, they're mine.

30:56.458 --> 30:58.291
I hear what you're saying.

30:58.375 --> 30:59.834
You want me to back off.

30:59.917 --> 31:02.208
I just need some
room to maneuver.

31:13.083 --> 31:15.917
If that's what you want,
that's what you get.

31:18.208 --> 31:20.125
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

31:21.375 --> 31:23.333
Now, that thing
from the other night.

31:23.417 --> 31:25.792
Yeah, I threw
it
in the
Schuylkill.

31:27.709 --> 31:29.625
Well, no harm, no foul.

31:29.709 --> 31:30.834
Gotta do it the right way.

31:30.917 --> 31:33.000
- Just got to do it my way.
- Hmm.

31:50.041 --> 31:51.959
Just got off the horn
with James McDonald

31:52.041 --> 31:54.125
foster dad's alibi.

31:54.208 --> 31:55.500
Finally grew a conscience

31:55.583 --> 31:57.291
admitted that
Kenny Watson's lying.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.792
- He wasn't fishing in '91.
- So, where was he?

31:59.875 --> 32:02.959
He was with his girlfriend,
Lisa Jackson up in DC.

32:03.041 --> 32:04.500
Met her when she was 15.

32:04.583 --> 32:05.792
(Kat)
'Argh.'

32:05.875 --> 32:08.375
AV finally salvaged
the rest of Donalyn's
tapes.

32:08.458 --> 32:10.500
Got the other
verse to her
song.

32:10.583 --> 32:12.917
She called Ken "the Phantom."

32:13.000 --> 32:14.709
Guess he'd turned
his eye on her.

32:14.792 --> 32:15.875
'"He sees it, too'

32:15.959 --> 32:17.458
"Now he's telling
me to run away

32:17.542 --> 32:20.083
"But I got Babygirl with me.
Where we gonna stay?"

32:20.166 --> 32:22.583
Alibi's not the only
thing
Kenneth lied about.

32:26.041 --> 32:27.417
Mr. Watson?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.208
Detectives?

32:32.291 --> 32:33.959
(Nick)
'Need to ask you
some questions.'

32:35.083 --> 32:36.709
Let me take the chains off.

32:38.917 --> 32:41.959
[metal clanking]
Mr. Watson?

32:42.041 --> 32:44.709
Hey Watson, you gotta
open that door right
now.

32:57.417 --> 32:59.208
Perv knew we were
on to him, boss.

32:59.291 --> 33:00.458
'Ate his gun
before we, you know.'

33:00.542 --> 33:01.834
Took the easy way out.

33:01.917 --> 33:04.542
Should've killed himself in
'91.
Saved us the hassle.

33:04.625 --> 33:06.375
Any proof he was
molesting Donalyn?

33:06.458 --> 33:08.208
Jailbait magazines
all over the place.

33:08.291 --> 33:11.041
Donalyn rapped about
a Phantom on her audio tape.

33:11.125 --> 33:12.375
I think she was talking
about Kenneth.

33:12.458 --> 33:14.917
Guy was a predator.
Killed her to cover it up.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.417
We're gonna need
more than that.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.250
Let's bring in Alice.
Pick up Meesha, too.

33:18.333 --> 33:20.792
Find out what was really
going on in that house.

33:25.709 --> 33:27.583
These are Donalyn's
DHS records.

33:27.667 --> 33:29.041
'Says she lived
with a family called'

33:29.125 --> 33:31.000
the Martins for
a month, but not
you?

33:32.041 --> 33:34.667
It was the only time
we were separated.

33:34.750 --> 33:35.834
She hated it there.

33:35.917 --> 33:38.083
Not the whole story, Meesha.

33:38.166 --> 33:41.291
Another girl reported
she was abused there.

33:42.709 --> 33:44.333
'Said Donalyn was, too.'

33:49.000 --> 33:50.834
She never told me.

33:50.917 --> 33:52.917
(Nick)
'She never told anyone.'

33:53.000 --> 33:54.834
She ever talk
about a "Phantom"?

33:56.583 --> 33:58.583
Something she made
up to scare me.

33:58.667 --> 34:00.875
"Lock your doors
so the Phantom doesn't come."

34:00.959 --> 34:01.917
'You know, kid stuff.'

34:02.000 --> 34:03.875
Ken took Donalyn to see

34:04.000 --> 34:06.166
"Phantom of the Opera," though.

34:06.250 --> 34:07.417
'Right?'

34:10.375 --> 34:12.041
What are you telling me?

34:12.125 --> 34:14.000
(Kat)
'Not me..'

34:14.083 --> 34:15.375
...your sister.

34:32.542 --> 34:34.166
I remember that song.

34:37.375 --> 34:40.083
- I wasn't tryin' to hurt
you.
- Of course you were.

34:47.166 --> 34:50.166
What's that supposed
to mean, huh?

34:50.250 --> 34:51.917
Look at me, Donalyn.

34:53.834 --> 34:55.583
After all we've done for you.

34:57.417 --> 34:58.834
Man, he wants me outta here.

34:58.917 --> 35:00.500
He told me to beat it before
something bad happened.

35:00.583 --> 35:01.875
He didn't say that.

35:01.959 --> 35:03.583
I've seen that look before.
I know what comes next.

35:03.667 --> 35:05.000
You don't know what
you're talking about.

35:05.083 --> 35:06.166
You think I'm some
kind of little kid?

35:06.250 --> 35:07.583
You're 14!

35:10.250 --> 35:12.041
You don't know
what I've been through.

35:12.125 --> 35:13.917
And I'm not about
to let it happen again

35:14.000 --> 35:16.125
to me or my little sister.

35:16.208 --> 35:17.959
Let what happen again?

35:24.041 --> 35:27.750
- You say you love us, right?
- Donalyn, please.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.917
'I'm trying here.'

35:30.000 --> 35:32.166
Kenny's trying.
Meesha's trying.

35:32.250 --> 35:34.250
Everybody's trying but you.

35:36.667 --> 35:37.917
Oh, God.

35:40.917 --> 35:42.542
- Where are you going?
- I'm outta here.

35:42.625 --> 35:45.458
Donalyn, wait!
Don't go! Just..

35:55.333 --> 35:56.792
All this time..

35:59.083 --> 36:01.875
...I thought
Donalyn abandoned me.

36:01.959 --> 36:04.166
She was just
trying to save me.

36:06.250 --> 36:08.542
- You see Donalyn after that?
- No.

36:10.917 --> 36:13.333
That was the last time
I saw my big sister.

36:14.500 --> 36:15.875
(Nick)
'What about Alice?'

36:15.959 --> 36:18.500
She said she stayed home
all
night with you. That true?

36:28.792 --> 36:31.959
You divorced in '92.
"Irreconcilable
differences."

36:32.041 --> 36:35.041
I'll bet it was a challenge when
you found out about Kenneth's..

36:35.125 --> 36:36.834
...tendencies.

36:36.917 --> 36:39.083
There's no reconciling
those, right?

36:39.166 --> 36:41.417
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.291
You're protecting him?
Even now?

36:43.375 --> 36:46.792
Kenny was a decent man.
Hard worker, a good provider.

36:46.875 --> 36:49.583
No, he was a predator.

36:49.667 --> 36:51.041
He knew we had his number.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.458
There's a reason
he offed himself.

36:52.542 --> 36:54.291
That's between him and God.

36:55.750 --> 36:58.417
He can't hurt
you anymore,
Alice.

36:58.500 --> 37:01.417
Can't hurt you
or the girls.

37:12.041 --> 37:13.917
Tell us what happened.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.083
You'll feel better,
I promise.

37:16.166 --> 37:18.375
He followed her to the club.

37:18.458 --> 37:20.333
To Sticky's?

37:20.417 --> 37:22.792
I told him what she said

37:22.875 --> 37:24.750
about taking Meesha away.

37:24.834 --> 37:29.000
He was supposed to
talk
some sense into her.

37:29.083 --> 37:31.250
- But she wouldn't listen?
- No.

37:32.542 --> 37:36.417
Said he hit her
over the head with a pipe.

37:38.083 --> 37:40.041
He told me he killed her.

37:44.250 --> 37:45.834
(Scotty)
'It's a gripping story..'

37:47.250 --> 37:49.291
- Alice.
- What?

37:54.417 --> 37:56.667
(Lilly)
'He-he couldn't have
been at the club'

37:56.750 --> 37:59.500
'cause he was in Maryland.

37:59.583 --> 38:01.834
Look it, had a room
at the Bethesda Inn

38:01.917 --> 38:04.500
with his
17 year old
girlfriend.

38:04.583 --> 38:05.625
Sevente..

38:07.208 --> 38:10.333
No. No, he-he came back home.

38:10.417 --> 38:12.000
He went after her.
He told me.

38:12.083 --> 38:15.583
The only person who'd know
Donalyn was beat with a pipe

38:15.667 --> 38:17.125
was the one did the beatin'..

38:18.208 --> 38:19.709
...that's you.

38:23.750 --> 38:25.291
It's over, Alice.

38:27.834 --> 38:30.250
She was gonna take
Meesha away.

38:33.166 --> 38:35.000
I couldn't let them go.

38:36.792 --> 38:38.166
You took Kenneth's side.

38:38.250 --> 38:41.709
No. No, God help me, no.
I kicked Kenneth out.

38:41.792 --> 38:43.208
I wasn't..

38:44.667 --> 38:46.750
...I wasn't going
to let him near Meesha.

38:48.959 --> 38:50.125
Please..

38:52.250 --> 38:54.083
...tell Meesha I'm sorry.

39:18.667 --> 39:21.417
Hey. Donalyn.

39:21.500 --> 39:22.583
What are you doing here?

39:22.667 --> 39:25.500
- We need to talk.
- Come on.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.166
(Alice)
'I know you're angry,
Donalyn.'

39:39.250 --> 39:41.166
But you can't just
keep running

39:41.250 --> 39:42.792
and dragging this
little girl behind you.

39:42.875 --> 39:47.458
I've been taking care
of Meesha all her life.

39:47.542 --> 39:49.458
Families talk.
They stick it
out.

39:49.542 --> 39:51.125
Well, we ain't your family.

39:52.709 --> 39:54.792
But you could be.

39:54.875 --> 39:56.500
I mean, you said it
yourself,
nothing happened.

39:56.583 --> 39:58.375
We're leaving tomorrow.

40:00.083 --> 40:02.792
Please, don't do this to Meesha.

40:02.875 --> 40:05.083
Meesha?

40:05.166 --> 40:08.375
All you talk about is Meesha!
You don't care nothing about
me!

40:08.458 --> 40:10.000
Who do you think
I'm
talking about now?

40:10.083 --> 40:12.917
You, Donalyn. Don't
you wanna be happy?

40:14.333 --> 40:15.750
Hey, I'm not gonna
pretend no more.

40:15.834 --> 40:18.083
I'm going out there tonight.
I'm gonna get me a contract.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.333
Then you're never
gonna see us again.

40:20.417 --> 40:23.500
You can't sing that song!
I won't let you take her
away!

40:27.792 --> 40:30.000
You're just a child!

40:30.083 --> 40:32.875
Old enough to call our social
worker. Tell her everything!

40:32.959 --> 40:34.250
Then you'll never get
any more kids!

40:34.333 --> 40:36.041
Shut your mouth!
I won't let you do that!

40:36.125 --> 40:37.625
You're not taking her!

40:42.500 --> 40:44.417
Oh, no.

40:44.500 --> 40:45.959
'Oh, Donalyn?'

40:47.125 --> 40:49.792
Oh, God! No!

40:49.875 --> 40:52.291
[sobbing]
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

40:52.375 --> 40:55.250
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry.

40:57.291 --> 40:58.750
'Donalyn?'

41:01.291 --> 41:03.792
(Big Soph)
'Whassup, Philly?
It's your girl, Big Soph'

41:03.875 --> 41:05.917
voice of Philly
Hip-Hop Radio 99 FM.

41:06.000 --> 41:08.291
I'm gonna take you
back to the '90s.

41:08.375 --> 41:11.667
Yeah, you know how we do it.
Authentic hip-hop.

41:11.750 --> 41:13.959
Gonna play you a new joint
by former street MC

41:14.041 --> 41:16.208
Donalyn Sullivan,
murdered back in '91.

41:16.291 --> 41:18.291
It's called
"Read Between the Lines."

41:18.375 --> 41:20.709
Shout out
to 26th and Sergeant.

41:21.959 --> 41:24.792
She's one of our own.
This one's for us.
