Gordon Ramsay's recipe

scrambled eggs.

Oh, thank you.
This looks amazing.

00:10.178 --> 00:13.147
Except I cut
the tomatoes in half.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.749
The recipe says
to saute them whole,

00:15.783 --> 00:17.051
but I once had a patient

00:17.085 --> 00:18.686
who almost choked
to death on a...

I'm glad
you like your breakfast.

00:28.896 --> 00:32.366
I read that if I made you feel
loved and cared for,

00:32.400 --> 00:34.868
it could help us work out
your insecurity.

with Lea.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.375
Aww, Shaun.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.379
You don't have to do
any more research.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.881
I am fine
with you and Lea
being friends.

making me eggs

01:06.567 --> 01:09.970
I made Carly
a special breakfast
this morning.

01:10.003 --> 01:13.073
And then she wanted
to have sex.

01:13.107 --> 01:15.075
So we did.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.677
That's great,
Shaun.

Next time,
feel free just to say
you missed the bus.

when you kiss and tell.

they do it all the time.

Apparently, you've never been
in the nurses' break room.

in there?

01:30.724 --> 01:32.059
Best lesson I learned
as a cop,

01:32.092 --> 01:33.661
better to feed down
than kiss up.

01:35.563 --> 01:38.766
Oh, it's my fault
we haven't started
our rounds.

It's all right.

01:44.071 --> 01:45.473
I'm glad
you're all here.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.042
Because I want
to apologize.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.648
Dr. Lim told me
she received a complaint

01:54.682 --> 01:56.217
about me
playing favorites.

01:57.318 --> 02:00.053
She obviously
didn't reveal
any names,

02:00.087 --> 02:01.722
but I want
to assure you all

02:01.755 --> 02:03.757
that I don't have
any favorites.

02:03.791 --> 02:06.093
And if I did anything
to give that impression,

02:07.094 --> 02:08.496
it's my mistake.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.597
It won't happen again.

02:10.664 --> 02:12.300
We're a team.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.134
And we need to be able
to communicate

02:15.169 --> 02:18.306
and trust each other
in order to be our best.

02:18.339 --> 02:21.108
So in the future,
if you have any concerns,

02:21.141 --> 02:22.543
you can come to me
directly.

Absolutely.

would've killed her.

Not much I can do

to make it quick.

03:33.146 --> 03:35.115
Why are you signing?

03:35.148 --> 03:37.418
He's mute,
but he's not deaf.

It helps us stay mindful
of what he's going through.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.593
What did he say?

He says when we get mad,
we don't sign... We yell.

we play soccer together.

they won't have to yell.

his lungs are clear

any sign of infection.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.010
Thank God.
The better news is

04:03.043 --> 04:05.879
he's a good candidate
for the surgery we discussed.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.648
Yes, it seems
a bit experimental.

It's shown
great results.

excise the scar tissue

he still
won't be able to talk,

to breathe normally.

It's a complicated procedure,
but given the severity

04:20.561 --> 04:22.696
of the infections
he's been dealing with,

05:24.992 --> 05:26.293
We were able
to stop the bleeding,

05:26.326 --> 05:27.761
which had caused you
to go into shock.

to go back in,

a lot more silently.

his own costal cartilage

19:16.956 --> 19:18.991
The larynx is
a complicated piece
of anatomy.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.294
Basically,
a tiny musical instrument.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.264
We can remove
two of his ribs

19:24.297 --> 19:26.966
to create the anterior
and posterior larynx frame

19:26.999 --> 19:29.436

the cartilage across it.

Yes.

it's worth the risk.

the nerve here got compressed

It's too wide a span

21:17.377 --> 21:18.878
out of silicone
and polyglycolide?

21:18.911 --> 21:20.747
We could use it to guide
the severed nerve ends

21:20.780 --> 21:22.114
to grow
toward each other,

21:22.148 --> 21:23.750
create a pathway for them
to connect and heal.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.218
I'm not sure the nerves
can grow across that distance.

It's definitely
worth a try.

experiment on her,

just sit back and do nothing.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.292
I'm not saying
we should do nothing.

I'm just saying we can't
experiment on her blindly.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.229
Maybe we could
use donor tissue
to bridge the gap.

21:37.263 --> 21:39.298
Well, that means putting the
patient on a transplant list.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.567

how long it would take

21:40.600 --> 21:42.201

a viable donation?

The firehouse won't hold
her position until she heals.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.738
She'd lose her job.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.440
Well, first, you want
to treat her like
a guinea pig,

21:47.474 --> 21:49.409
and now you're
deeply concerned about
her life experience.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.177
You just want to be right.
And you don't?

at any point?

about this situation either,

you're overreacting.

you're fine with it,

he always tells the truth.

that he's not

it's Dr. Melendez
you should thank.

He did the surgery.

do anything.

Okay.
You're welcome.

feeling?

incredibly nice and supportive
to your fellow resident.

37:41.126 --> 37:42.260
I told you,

37:42.294 --> 37:45.263
I just felt like
Dr. Melendez's
treatment of Browne

37:45.297 --> 37:46.798
was starting
to cause dissension
on the team.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.602
I have no doubt
that's part of the truth.

37:50.636 --> 37:53.038
I'm guessing
the other part was...

37:53.071 --> 37:54.940
Preemptive.

37:54.973 --> 37:57.042
You thought
it would inoculate you.

We'd never be able
to fire someone

37:58.777 --> 38:00.779

against their attending.

38:01.647 --> 38:04.049
Which is why
I'm so confused.

38:04.082 --> 38:07.085
Why would you feel like
your job could be in jeopardy?

38:07.118 --> 38:08.987
I don't.
