01:03.605 --> 01:05.315
We're going to miss you, sir.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.984
Ah, you guys seem
to be fine without me.

01:08.359 --> 01:10.695
Your mission is here. Mine is on Earth.

01:10.779 --> 01:14.240
As soon as I get back, I'll inform
the Galaxy Garrison what's going on

01:14.324 --> 01:16.993
and start working to upgrade
our planetary defenses.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.912
Tell Iverson, the next time I see him,

01:18.995 --> 01:21.498
I'm going to kick his butt
for strapping me to that table.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.001
I'll be sure to tell him that.

01:25.084 --> 01:27.837
Hey, I had everyone record
some messages for our families.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.298
Uh, a little heads up,
I got teary in mine, so...

01:30.381 --> 01:32.008
that's Mom's eyes only.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.676
Of course.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.345
You don't wanna see Lance's, either,

01:35.428 --> 01:39.474
since it's probably just a love message
to Jenny Shaybon or the other Jenny.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.726
-What was her name again?
-Shut up, Hunk!

01:42.352 --> 01:45.271
Okay, I was just joking around. Jeez.

01:46.523 --> 01:49.567
-Hey, are you okay, dude?
-I'm fine. It's just...

01:49.651 --> 01:52.237
Once I started thinking
about going back to Earth, I...

01:52.320 --> 01:55.281
I started missing my mom
and my brother Marco

01:55.365 --> 01:57.992
and my brother Luis
and my sister Veronica

01:58.076 --> 01:59.786
and my grandma and...

02:02.539 --> 02:04.791
- Um, are you crying?
- No!

02:04.874 --> 02:08.169
No, I just...
I just got space dust in my eyes.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.045
It's very dusty in here.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.343
-I guess this is it.
-I wish I could go with you.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.596
I'd love to help build
Earth's first galactic defense system.

02:19.055 --> 02:21.516
I'm worried we won't have enough time
and resources

02:21.599 --> 02:23.476
to make a dent before we need it.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.812
A wise man once told me,

02:25.895 --> 02:28.064
"If you get worried
about what could go wrong,

02:28.148 --> 02:30.525
you might miss your chance
to do something great."

02:32.986 --> 02:34.737
Sounds like a wise man indeed.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.283
Matt, you be careful
on the front lines.

02:39.033 --> 02:41.578
And, Pidge, keep an eye
on your brother for me.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.829
You got it, Dad.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.167
I love you both so much.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.460
We love you too, Dad.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.423
There is a lot of space dust in here.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.385
It's filthy!

03:18.656 --> 03:22.577
This base was, until recently,
run by a Galra commander named Ranveig,

03:22.660 --> 03:24.954
who was developing
a super weapon of some sort.

03:25.455 --> 03:27.165
We're not sure of the weapon's specs,

03:27.248 --> 03:30.209
but we do know
that it is incredibly powerful.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.003
How did we learn all this?

03:32.086 --> 03:34.047
We have a spy in Ranveig's camp

03:34.130 --> 03:37.091
who's managed to acquire
high-level security clearance.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.971
Since Ranveig's departure, it's possible
she assumed control of the base,

03:42.055 --> 03:43.514
but we can't be sure.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.724
Why not?

03:44.807 --> 03:47.185
We're not the only ones
who know of the weapon.

03:47.810 --> 03:51.105
Two Galra factions,
led by Commanders Trugg and Ladnok,

03:51.189 --> 03:53.233
are at war over the territory.

03:53.316 --> 03:57.111
Since their fighting began,
all communication has been cut off.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.822
We need you to infiltrate the base,

03:59.906 --> 04:03.034
extract our spy,
and destroy Ranveig's weapon.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.746
Keith, this is of the utmost importance.

04:06.829 --> 04:08.706
If either faction acquires this weapon,

04:08.790 --> 04:11.042
it could tip the balance of power
in their favor.

04:11.125 --> 04:14.003
So you cannot allow your feelings
to cloud your judgment.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.214
-I wouldn't--
-You have in the past.

04:16.297 --> 04:19.341
Remember, the mission
is the only thing that matters.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.719
Emotions are a luxury we cannot afford.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.556
This is the operative
you'll be contacting.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.142
Her name is Krolia.

04:33.022 --> 04:35.900
Can't believe we're flying
into the belly of the beast.

04:36.818 --> 04:40.238
Strange to think last time
we were here, we were fighting the Galra.

04:40.321 --> 04:41.656
Now we're working with them.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.535
We have to do everything we can
to support Lotor.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.329
This is our chance
to promote a new era of peace.

04:58.756 --> 05:00.508
Thank you for coming, friends.

05:00.591 --> 05:04.053
I have prepared a new imperial banner
to herald our alliance.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.724
This is the same symbol
that flew over our fathers

05:07.807 --> 05:11.102
when they worked together
as the original Paladins of Voltron.

05:11.853 --> 05:15.356
I hope that we can return the universe
to that golden age.

05:16.065 --> 05:20.236
Since I ascended to the throne,
the Galra Empire has been torn apart.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.448
A sizeable portion
has sworn its allegiance to me.

05:23.531 --> 05:26.617
However, massive factions
remain in revolt.

05:27.368 --> 05:30.830
Uh, okay, the Galra aren't exactly known
to turn the other cheek.

05:30.913 --> 05:33.291
They're more likely
to swing the other fist.

05:33.374 --> 05:36.753
How do you get an empire that's only known
violence for thousands of years

05:36.836 --> 05:38.588
to put down their weapons?

05:38.671 --> 05:42.216
By providing them with the very thing
they're fighting for.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.595
Quintessence. Unlimited amounts of it.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.556
And, Allura,
you are the key to getting it.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.810
I'm sure you'll be interested
in inspecting every aspect

05:52.894 --> 05:54.604
of the Galra headquarters.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.939
I'd like
to cross-reference our star charts

05:57.023 --> 05:59.025
with current Galra troop locations.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.526
Consider it done.

06:00.610 --> 06:04.072
You want to sync our intelligence
to the Galra headquarters?

06:04.155 --> 06:06.866
Oh, I never thought I'd see
the quiznaking quintant.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.494
Sentry, take them to the record room.

06:09.577 --> 06:11.496
You will find everything you need there.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.334
I'm leaving you a personal escort

06:16.417 --> 06:18.669
that will take you
wherever you'd like to go.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.589
Come, Princess.
There is much work to be done.

06:30.014 --> 06:33.851
So we're free to roam around Galra HQ
and have some fun?

06:34.435 --> 06:35.728
What is fun?

06:37.897 --> 06:39.190
You're about to find out.

06:40.024 --> 06:42.819
Lance, it's a robot. It can't have fun.

06:43.945 --> 06:47.198
Unless... I reprogram it.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.700
Take us to the sentry repair center!

07:02.797 --> 07:05.341
We have you outgunned, Ladnok.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.301
There is no need for further bloodshed.

07:07.385 --> 07:11.097
Stand down
and I will absorb your crew into my fleet.

07:11.180 --> 07:13.683
Do you take me for a fool, Trugg?

07:13.766 --> 07:15.685
We both know Ranveig developed a weapon

07:15.768 --> 07:19.355
capable of conferring an insurmountable
advantage on either of us.

07:19.897 --> 07:22.525
And we both know it's located
somewhere on his base.

07:22.608 --> 07:26.195
Indeed. We also both know
that this battle is all but over.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.030
You cannot win.

07:28.114 --> 07:32.118
I will possess Ranveig's weapon
or I will die in the attempt.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.413
Destroy what's left of them.

07:49.677 --> 07:52.305
- Reconfigured processor inserted.
- Check.

07:52.388 --> 07:55.349
- Wired for optimal performance.
- Checkity-check.

07:55.433 --> 08:00.104
Now, just gotta upload
the new program, and...

08:00.646 --> 08:01.939
All right, I'm finished.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.818
Yeah! Team Punk does it again.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.823
How do we know if it worked?

08:18.164 --> 08:19.207
Aaah!

08:19.290 --> 08:20.500
Oof!

08:20.583 --> 08:24.921
You dum-dums got any non-lethal,
semi-combustible diversionary devices?

08:25.004 --> 08:26.422
What?

08:26.506 --> 08:29.800
I think he's... looking for firecrackers!

08:30.635 --> 08:32.929
Oh. It worked.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.482
-Awesome!
-That was sweet.

08:44.565 --> 08:47.401
- Amazer-beams!
- What next?

08:47.485 --> 08:50.238
Hunk, hand me another packet of food goo.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.864
Halt!

08:52.406 --> 08:55.993
You are being detained
for unsafe sustenance preparation.

08:57.161 --> 08:58.162
Scram.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.627
This robot is sweet!

09:18.391 --> 09:21.394
Looks like things have escalated
between Ladnok and Trugg.

09:21.978 --> 09:25.606
Best to try to blend in with the debris.
Don't wanna attract any fire.

09:26.190 --> 09:27.233
Here goes nothing.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.164
Krolia.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.420
You're late.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.755
We don't have much time.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.220
What is this place?

11:20.096 --> 11:21.555
Haggar's lair.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.766
Why would you bring me here?

11:24.725 --> 11:29.397
Our fathers traveled through the rift
into the space between reality.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.358
I believe Alfor's Altean alchemy
made that possible.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.903
There may be something in here

11:35.986 --> 11:38.781
that contains secrets
that Haggar was unable to unlock.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.366
But you can.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.577
I shouldn't be here.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.413
Allura...

11:46.080 --> 11:49.083
Please... I cannot do this without you.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.629
All right.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.214
Thank you.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.925
Now, where should we begin?

12:07.726 --> 12:08.727
Look at this.

12:10.479 --> 12:12.314
It’s an Altean science log.

12:15.359 --> 12:19.155
This was written by my mother,
Honerva, thousands of years ago.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.739
Your mother was Honerva?

12:21.615 --> 12:24.452
The Honerva that discovered the rift
on Daibazaal?

12:25.494 --> 12:26.495
Then you're...

12:27.413 --> 12:28.497
half-Altean.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.291
Yes.

12:30.374 --> 12:33.043
It was something the Galra
considered a weakness,

12:33.127 --> 12:35.296
but I considered it a strength.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.465
The union between Zarkon and Honerva

12:37.548 --> 12:40.968
sparked a technological revolution
within the empire.

12:41.051 --> 12:44.513
Even back then,
Altean culture was remarkably advanced.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.724
The kinds of experiments
she was conducting...

12:46.807 --> 12:49.185
she advanced science by eons.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.729
How did Haggar get her hands on this?

12:51.812 --> 12:54.440
She was constantly seeking
Altean magical knowledge

12:54.523 --> 12:57.193
that she could pervert for her own power.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.112
There must have been things
that she was unable to access.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.032
I'm going to continue the search.

13:15.794 --> 13:18.380
That's it! Hold that pose.
The camera loves you.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.674
- And get one more of me.
- Halt!

13:20.758 --> 13:21.592
Scram.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.387
Get back here!

13:34.522 --> 13:36.565
-Huh?
-Hey!

13:45.032 --> 13:47.409
Razzle-dazzle!

13:49.620 --> 13:50.913
Ramming speed.

14:04.843 --> 14:08.138
So there are no hard feelings,
I made you these.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.475
So worth it.

14:13.894 --> 14:16.355
Why did Kolivan
risk sending you here now?

14:16.939 --> 14:19.316
Because he's heard
about Ranveig's super weapon.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.360
We can't let it fall into the wrong hands.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.237
I guess Ranveig's dead

14:23.320 --> 14:25.447
since Commander Trugg
is attacking my base.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.867
Trugg is on the verge
of crushing your forces.

14:27.950 --> 14:31.328
We have to destroy the super weapon now.
What is the weapon exactly?

14:31.912 --> 14:35.374
Warlord Ranveig intercepted
an undocumented shipment of quintessence

14:35.457 --> 14:36.959
traveling through his territory.

14:37.751 --> 14:40.880
He took it for his own
and began experimenting with it.

14:40.963 --> 14:45.050
It's more powerful than any quintessence
we've received from the empire,

14:45.134 --> 14:48.178
and it has some very unexpected effects.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.765
First level breached!

14:51.849 --> 14:53.684
Activating second level of defense!

14:55.603 --> 14:57.438
Trugg's fleet has touched down.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.939
We're running out of time!

14:59.481 --> 15:00.524
Come on!

15:09.074 --> 15:10.075
What's the matter?

15:10.951 --> 15:12.453
By the end of these logs,

15:12.536 --> 15:14.830
it's like they're written
by a different person.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.583
She's frantic, paranoid, erratic.

15:18.167 --> 15:22.004
Her reason and intellect are gone,
replaced by fear and paranoia.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.091
Lotor, have you ever wondered...

15:26.175 --> 15:29.595
what if Honerva became corrupted
the same way Zarkon did?

15:30.471 --> 15:31.931
Perhaps she didn't die.

15:32.681 --> 15:37.102
-What if she and Haggar are the same--
-That witch is not my mother.

15:40.773 --> 15:44.818
There must be something else in this room,
something we missed.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.362
I've looked all over.

15:46.445 --> 15:48.989
I can't find anything
pertaining to Altean alchemy.

15:50.658 --> 15:54.078
Perhaps we are not using
all the tools at our disposal.

15:54.161 --> 15:59.541
Close your eyes and just...
let yourself feel the energy around you.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.256
See if any of these objects
call out to you.

16:16.350 --> 16:17.935
I was drawn to this.

16:18.727 --> 16:20.187
Wait a tick.

16:20.270 --> 16:23.107
I know I've seen something
about this before.

16:25.734 --> 16:27.611
Where is it? Here.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.406
These are ancient ruins

16:30.489 --> 16:33.784
from an Altean outpost
now beneath the seas of Planet Entuk.

16:34.410 --> 16:38.163
There, I found a mosaic depicting
Altean explorers following a map

16:38.247 --> 16:41.125
projected from what they called
a "compass stone."

16:41.208 --> 16:45.212
Supposedly, it can lead
to the magical realm of Oriande,

16:45.295 --> 16:48.257
which houses the secrets
of Altean alchemy.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.760
Oriande?
I thought that was a folktale.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.723
My research has led me to believe
it is quite real.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.934
We need to get this stone working.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.398
Get to that console!

17:06.900 --> 17:07.901
What now?

17:07.984 --> 17:10.445
We need to simultaneously
enter this code.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.688
Surrender or die.

17:49.693 --> 17:50.569
Huh?

17:58.327 --> 17:59.953
We can make a deal.

18:00.621 --> 18:01.789
What are you doing?

18:01.872 --> 18:03.040
I left you once.

18:03.832 --> 18:05.167
I'll never leave you again.

18:06.210 --> 18:09.088
Give us a ship,
and I'll give you the codes to the weapon.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.216
Why should I trust you?

18:12.299 --> 18:13.842
You don't have a choice.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.345
I'm the only one
who knows the access code.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.556
If you try to break in,
the room will self-destruct.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.226
Once we're airborne,
I'll give you the code.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.775
It won't open.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.528
You just have to concentrate.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.738
I know you have the power within.

18:37.366 --> 18:38.826
What if I don't?

18:38.909 --> 18:42.037
My father had an ability
few Alteans possessed.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.623
Coran doesn't have it,
Honerva didn't have it.

18:45.707 --> 18:49.419
The truth is,
I may not have his abilities either.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.671
You must.

18:50.754 --> 18:53.715
There must be a way to carry on
the tradition of Altean alchemy.

18:54.466 --> 18:58.220
That tradition died along
with my planet 10,000 years ago.

18:59.012 --> 19:01.348
I'll never be the alchemist my father was.

19:13.277 --> 19:15.571
Allura... you've done it.

19:16.446 --> 19:17.531
Is that...?

19:19.825 --> 19:20.868
Oriande.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.498
Are you sure about this?

19:26.582 --> 19:30.085
We've been over this
already. Let's light this candle.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.129
Whoo!

19:32.212 --> 19:35.299
Do you think Lotor would mind us
firing the robeast coffin?

19:35.382 --> 19:36.425
I don't know.

19:36.508 --> 19:39.344
Come on,
I've always wanted to see the stars.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.513
And now you will.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.478
Later, pala-dudes.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.689
Whee!

20:00.199 --> 20:03.118
That's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.329
He's my hero.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.721
I still can't believe you'd give them
the weapon just to save me.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.097
You compromised the mission.

20:24.681 --> 20:26.600
Keith, shut up and trust me.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.104
Commander Trugg,
we are prepared for liftoff.

20:31.688 --> 20:34.608
- Are you at the weapon's console?
- Affirmative.

20:35.108 --> 20:38.528
The code is Beta-5-2-7-4...

20:39.196 --> 20:41.740
Omega-5-4-5.

20:44.868 --> 20:46.078
Confirmed.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.829
Get us out of here, now!

21:01.468 --> 21:02.803
Shoot them down.

21:13.605 --> 21:16.775
They're locking onto us! Hold on!

21:51.810 --> 21:54.271
This is why you shouldn't have made
that trade for me.

21:54.354 --> 21:57.107
We could die and you just handed
that weapon over to Trugg.

21:57.774 --> 22:01.153
No, Keith. I handed them over to it.

22:26.762 --> 22:29.806
We're far enough away.
They stopped firing at us.

22:36.229 --> 22:38.148
I should give this back to you.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.152
How were you able to use it?

22:44.029 --> 22:45.989
Because it used to be mine...

22:46.073 --> 22:47.949
before I gave it to your father.

22:49.284 --> 22:50.285
You're my...?

22:51.305 --> 22:57.320
