[snoring]

01:27.554 --> 01:29.421
Alright, folks.
It's time.

01:29.490 --> 01:31.490
Good evening, skipper.
Goodevening, ladies.

01:31.558 --> 01:32.958
No cause for alarm,
gilligan.

01:33.026 --> 01:34.693
It's just the skipper.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.462
Always be sure
to identify yourselves
when gilligan's on watch.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.664
He tends
to be trigger-happy.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.466
Shoots first
and asks questions later.

01:41.534 --> 01:43.535
Gilligan,
is everything alright?

01:44.772 --> 01:46.004
Gilligan?

01:46.073 --> 01:47.505
Gilligan!

01:47.574 --> 01:50.542
Halt, or I'll shoot!
Oh, hi, skipper.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.445
We're terribly sorry
to wake you when you're
on sentry duty, gilligan.

01:53.514 --> 01:55.514
Oh,
that's alright.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.649
Alright, folks.
Flare time.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.584
Why do we fire off
a flare every night?

01:59.653 --> 02:01.353
We don't even know
if there's a ship
out there.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.654
But we don't know
there isn't one, either.

02:02.723 --> 02:04.623
Might be a freighter
or an oil tanker.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.692
A freighter
or an oil tanker?

02:06.760 --> 02:07.426
Ugh.

02:07.494 --> 02:09.127
That's alright,
lovey.

02:09.196 --> 02:11.129
We can wait for a yacht.

02:11.198 --> 02:12.397
Skipper: Everybody,
gather over here now.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.232
Keep your fingers crossed.

02:14.301 --> 02:15.634
How many flares
do we have left?

02:15.702 --> 02:16.868
About 150.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.103
Everybody ready?

02:18.172 --> 02:19.938
Stand by.

02:20.007 --> 02:21.139
Ready...

02:21.208 --> 02:22.441
Fire!

02:26.313 --> 02:28.346
Now let's pray that
somebody saw our signal.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.082
Well, if they did,
i hope they don't
come barging

02:30.151 --> 02:31.316
in the middle
of the night
to rescue us.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.118
I'm simply exhausted.

02:33.186 --> 02:35.988
Yes, we haven't had
a decent night's sleep
since we got here.

02:36.056 --> 02:37.289
I don't think
any of us have.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.290
[Snoring]

02:38.358 --> 02:39.558
Except gilligan.

02:42.629 --> 02:43.928
Gilligan!

02:43.997 --> 02:45.597
Halt,
or I'll shoot!

02:45.666 --> 02:47.665
Oh, hi, skipper.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.434
Well, you folks
may as well turn in.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.802
I'll have a talk
with our sentry,

02:50.871 --> 02:53.171
that is if he can
stay awake long enough.

02:53.239 --> 02:54.105
Goodnight.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.440
Goodnight, ladies.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.878
Gilligan, how many bullets
have you got left in that gun?

02:59.947 --> 03:01.380
One.
[Fires gun]

03:01.448 --> 03:02.914
See?

03:02.983 --> 03:04.783
What did you want
to talk to me about,
skipper?

03:04.852 --> 03:08.052
Gilligan, sentry duty
is a sacred trust.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.855
You've got to keep a close
watch on the weather.
If it starts to rain,

03:10.924 --> 03:13.225
you've got to see
that the supplies
in the hut are kept dry.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.726
You can depend on me,
skipper.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.328
Most important of all,

03:16.396 --> 03:17.296
you have to keep
a constant lookout
for ships.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.296
Aye, aye, sir.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.098
Watch that ocean
like a hawk.

03:20.166 --> 03:23.468
Like a hawk, sir.
If there's a ship out
there, I'll see it.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.437
If there's
a ship out there,
it's in trouble.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.806
The ocean's this way!

03:27.874 --> 03:30.742
I thought that seaweed
looked awful tall.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.677
Gilligan. Are you
really wide awake?

03:32.746 --> 03:33.511
Wide awake, sir.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.412
No more sleeping
on your post?

03:34.480 --> 03:35.580
No more sleeping, sir.

03:35.648 --> 03:37.415
Good man. I'll see you
in the morning.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.084
In the morning, sir.
Goodnight.

03:39.153 --> 03:40.652
Goodnight, sir.

03:46.660 --> 03:47.092
[Snoring]

03:47.160 --> 03:48.860
[Yelling]

04:07.447 --> 04:08.713
Ahem.
Halt!

04:08.782 --> 04:10.282
No!

04:10.350 --> 04:11.917
Friend or foe?

04:15.222 --> 04:16.553
Attaboy, gilligan.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.656
Nice to see that
you're still awake
at your post.

04:18.725 --> 04:20.257
When you told me
how important
sentry duty was,

04:20.327 --> 04:22.159
I didn't shut my eyes
the whole night,
skipper,

04:22.228 --> 04:24.162
not even once,
not even one little
teeny-weeny--

04:24.231 --> 04:25.463
give me that gun!

04:25.532 --> 04:27.198
Can I go to bed now,
huh, skipper?

04:27.267 --> 04:28.199
Certainly, gilligan.
You've earned a rest.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.333
Thank you, sir.

04:29.402 --> 04:30.635
Right after you've
chopped some wood,

04:30.704 --> 04:31.936
cooked the breakfast,
and cleaned up the area,

04:32.005 --> 04:33.872
I want you to take a nap,
and that's an order.

04:33.940 --> 04:34.773
Thank you, sir.

04:34.841 --> 04:35.606
Now let's get inside

04:35.675 --> 04:37.643
and rustle up
some breakfast.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.024
Thanks a lot,
gilligan.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.794
Ooh!
Watch your head, skipper.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.032
Hey, look.

05:05.405 --> 05:06.704
We've been robbed.

05:06.773 --> 05:08.206
Robbed?

05:08.275 --> 05:09.674
Somebody broke in here
last night.

05:09.742 --> 05:11.342
I think you're right,
skipper.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.477
Gilligan, if you were
wide awake on your post,

05:12.546 --> 05:14.179
how could somebody
get in the hut?

05:14.247 --> 05:16.447
Guess they must have
picked the lock
on the back door.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.116
There is no back door.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.985
Oh, then they came in
through the window.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.752
There is no window.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.822
How about
down the chimney?

05:23.891 --> 05:25.457
No chimney.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.359
No back door,
there's no window,
and there's no chimney.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.662
Skipper, looks like
we're up against
a pretty clever thief.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.563
Gilligan!
Why don't you admit it?

05:32.632 --> 05:34.399
You were asleep
on guard duty.

05:34.468 --> 05:36.201
Only during the robbery.

05:36.269 --> 05:37.869
Oh, get out of here!

05:40.373 --> 05:41.773
Well, move!

05:44.211 --> 05:45.444
Thanks again,
gilligan.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.677
Now, come on.

05:46.746 --> 05:47.979
Got to tell
the others about this.

05:48.048 --> 05:48.980
Mary Ann:
Good morning.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.281
Good morning, ladies.
Professor.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.382
Skipper.
Hi.

05:51.451 --> 05:52.584
Can I help
with breakfast?

05:52.653 --> 05:54.219
There may not
be any breakfast.

05:54.288 --> 05:56.120
Thanks to
sleeping beauty here,
we've been robbed.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.456
Robbed?

05:57.524 --> 05:59.223
Yes. Somebody broke
into the supply hut,

05:59.292 --> 06:02.026
took our food supplies,
the flashlight,
and our flare gun.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.629
There's only one answer.
There must be someone else
living on the island.

06:04.698 --> 06:05.830
You're right, professor.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.031
Well, it could be
an animal.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.200
You're right, ginger.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.001
No. Flashlight
and a flare gun?

06:10.070 --> 06:11.802
Those things
are only useful to a man.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.738
Well, if it were a man,
we'd have seen him
before now.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.106
Gilligan:
You're right, Mary Ann.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.941
It could be someone
wanted by the police,

06:17.010 --> 06:18.543
an escaped convict
or a murderer.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.744
You're right again,
professor.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.312
Gilligan, will you
cut that out?

06:21.381 --> 06:22.914
Everyone can't be right.

06:22.983 --> 06:23.915
Skipper...

06:23.984 --> 06:24.582
What?

06:24.651 --> 06:26.685
You're right, too.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.487
Hey, do you really
think it was
an escaped convict?

06:28.555 --> 06:31.088
Or a murderer?

06:31.157 --> 06:34.992
For our own safety,
i suggest we start
an immediate search.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.862
That's a good idea,
professor. Come on, gilligan.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.231
If we had
to get marooned
on an island,

06:39.299 --> 06:42.199
why didn't we
pick Manhattan?

06:42.268 --> 06:44.569
Can't I go along with
you and the professor
on the manhunt?

06:44.638 --> 06:47.371
No, gilligan. I want you
to stay here with Mr. howell
and guard the women.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.707
Most of all,
we've got to get
that flare gun back.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.208
Well, you be careful,
huh, skipper?

06:51.277 --> 06:53.444
'Cause if it is
an escaped convict
or a vicious killer,

06:53.513 --> 06:55.680
he might be dangerous.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.382
Just between us,
gilligan,

06:57.450 --> 07:01.118
I hope it's only
a vicious killer
or an escaped convict.

07:01.187 --> 07:02.954
I'm afraid
it's something
much worse.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.723
Something much worse?

07:04.791 --> 07:06.223
Yes.
I think it's voodoo.

07:06.292 --> 07:07.425
Voodoo?!

07:07.493 --> 07:08.660
Shh. Let's not
upset the women.

07:08.728 --> 07:10.728
Let's not upset
the men, either.

07:10.797 --> 07:12.297
Really fantastic things
have been going on

07:12.366 --> 07:13.732
in these waters,
gilligan,

07:13.800 --> 07:15.232
for which there's
only one explanation.

07:15.301 --> 07:16.734
Voodoo?

07:16.803 --> 07:18.369
Voodoo.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.637
Think of it.

07:19.706 --> 07:21.472
Ever since we got
to this island,

07:21.541 --> 07:22.674
we've had nothing
but bad luck,

07:22.743 --> 07:24.642
one disaster
after another.

07:24.711 --> 07:25.743
What do you think
caused it?

07:25.812 --> 07:27.712
I thought we all
agreed it was me.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.815
No, gilligan.
Voodoo.

07:30.883 --> 07:33.417
Some people
think it's a silly
superstition,

07:33.486 --> 07:35.920
but I've heard tales
that witch doctors
in these parts

07:35.989 --> 07:38.957
can turn people
into hyenas
and baboons

07:39.026 --> 07:41.959
and all kinds of
wild jungle animals.

07:42.028 --> 07:45.964
Gilligan, I think
my shoe is full now.

07:46.667 --> 07:47.999
Oh. Sorry, sir.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.335
Thank you very much.

07:50.404 --> 07:52.937
Evil spirits
are spawned in these
waters, gilligan,

07:53.006 --> 07:54.806
and they cast
their black spell

07:54.875 --> 07:56.341
over all those who
invade their domain.

07:56.409 --> 07:57.142
Ready, skipper.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.577
Oh!
Aah!

07:58.645 --> 07:59.744
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean
to scare you.

07:59.812 --> 08:01.045
That's alright.
I was scared already.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.848
I think we better
be going, professor.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.651
Uh, gilligan,
I'm leaving these
things with you.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.052
A gun
and a rabbit's foot.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.354
If one doesn't work,
use the other.

08:10.423 --> 08:11.556
Come on, professor.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.491
But, skipper...

08:13.560 --> 08:14.959
We don't have any bullets
for this gun.

08:15.028 --> 08:16.961
Well, you know that,
and I know that,

08:17.030 --> 08:19.164
but the killer
won't know it.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.500
I'm all aglow.

08:22.569 --> 08:24.936
Golly, ginger,
am I scared.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.337
I've never been
so frightened
in my whole life.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.605
Neither have I.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.507
Just think.
There may be
some strange man

08:29.576 --> 08:30.775
loose on this island.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.844
That's what I am
thinking.

08:32.912 --> 08:34.546
Honey, would you
hand me my compact,
please?

08:34.614 --> 08:36.381
What compact?

08:36.450 --> 08:37.849
This.

08:38.619 --> 08:39.985
Clamshell?

08:40.053 --> 08:41.184
Yeah. Cute, huh?

08:41.254 --> 08:42.620
I made it myself.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.489
I had to have something
to put my makeup in.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.624
Well, there's nothing
in there but berries.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.460
That's right.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.627
The red berries
are lipstick,

08:49.696 --> 08:50.828
the blueberries
are shadow,

08:50.897 --> 08:52.196
and the blackberries
are mascara.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.931
Oh, honestly, ginger.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.499
You don't seem
the least bit worried.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.669
What's there
to worry about?

08:57.738 --> 09:00.538
Well, suppose the man
they're looking for
turns out to be a killer.

09:00.606 --> 09:03.941
Honey, if the man
they're looking for
turns out to be a man,

09:04.010 --> 09:06.044
<i> he</i> can do the worrying.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.250
Hi, gilligan.
Whoops. Stop. Stop.

09:13.319 --> 09:14.685
Well,
what are you doing?

09:14.754 --> 09:16.387
I just set a trap
for the prowler.

09:16.456 --> 09:17.588
So did I.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.557
How does
yours work?

09:19.626 --> 09:21.392
When he comes
down the trail
to the supply hut,

09:21.461 --> 09:24.029
his foot hits the stick,
goes into the loop, and...

09:24.097 --> 09:24.629
You've got your man.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.264
If it is a man.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.899
You never know
what an evil spirit
might look like.

09:27.967 --> 09:30.368
Evil spirit?
What are you
talking about?

09:30.437 --> 09:32.069
Oh, nothing.
Nothing at all.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.905
Gilligan, are you
trying to tell us
something?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.440
I'm trying not to tell you
something.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.908
Alright, let me
put it this way:

09:36.977 --> 09:38.276
What is it
you're trying
not to tell us?

09:38.345 --> 09:40.378
Please stop asking
so many questions, huh?

09:40.446 --> 09:42.213
You'll both feel a lot safer
if you just think

09:42.281 --> 09:45.116
there's a dangerous killer
loose on the island.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.354
Now, stay away from
this area, huh, girls?

09:49.422 --> 09:51.856
And whatever you do,
don't walk down this path

09:51.925 --> 09:54.592
and put your foot
into this--ooh!

09:54.661 --> 09:56.194
Help, skipper!

09:56.263 --> 09:57.162
Gilligan!

09:57.230 --> 09:58.796
Alright...

09:58.865 --> 10:00.297
I won't put my foot
in that rope.

10:00.366 --> 10:03.167
Help, skipper!

10:03.236 --> 10:04.736
Skipper, help!

10:04.805 --> 10:06.604
Well, that does it,
lovey.

10:06.673 --> 10:10.241
Sturdy bit
of construction,
if I say so myself.

10:10.310 --> 10:14.446
Thurston, what on earth
is that on your forehead?

10:14.514 --> 10:15.713
Oh,
it looks like water.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.715
I wonder
where it came from.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.883
Thurston,
i know what it is.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.618
I used to see it
on our gardener.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.052
It's perspiration.

10:22.121 --> 10:24.054
It is?
What can I put it in?

10:24.123 --> 10:26.090
I've got to
send it to dad.
He'd be fascinated.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.659
Gilligan:
Mr. and Mrs. howell!

10:27.728 --> 10:29.160
Oh, dear. I do wish
people wouldn't drop by

10:29.229 --> 10:30.762
without letting us know
that they're coming.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.097
It's only gilligan,
lovey.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.932
Yes, I know,
but everything's
in such a mess.

10:35.001 --> 10:36.934
The place
looks like a hut.

10:37.003 --> 10:38.936
It is a rather
crude cabana.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.170
Come in.
Come in, boy.

10:40.239 --> 10:41.773
I just thought
I'd check
on you folks.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.274
Hey,
what's that?

10:43.342 --> 10:45.009
Well, we thought
with a prowler
in the neighborhood

10:45.078 --> 10:46.944
we'd better not
take any chances,

10:47.013 --> 10:49.247
so thurston
put up these bars.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.983
That's what we need--
some neighborhood bars.

10:53.052 --> 10:54.952
Oh, thurston,
you are a devil.

10:55.021 --> 10:57.688
Yeah, I come up with them
under pressure.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.023
Skipper: Gilligan!

10:59.091 --> 11:00.257
Hey,
that's the skipper.

11:00.326 --> 11:04.129
I better go see
what he found out.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.230
Oh, dash it all!

11:06.299 --> 11:07.298
What is it, dear?

11:07.367 --> 11:09.466
I forgot to show him
my perspiration.

11:09.535 --> 11:10.668
Ohh.

11:10.737 --> 11:13.771
I wonder if i
could do it again.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.941
Skipper! Skipper,
where are you?

11:17.010 --> 11:18.777
Over here,
gilligan.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.880
Where?

11:22.948 --> 11:25.050
Right here, gilligan.

11:27.153 --> 11:29.086
I see you've
found my trap.

11:29.155 --> 11:30.722
Yes, I did.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.390
Works pretty good,
huh?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.992
Works fine.
Works just fine.

11:35.061 --> 11:36.794
Oh, good.
It had me
pretty worried.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.996
I didn't think it was
gonna work at all.

11:39.065 --> 11:41.499
You don't have
to worry about
the trap, gilligan.

11:41.568 --> 11:44.034
You don't have to
worry about anything...

11:44.103 --> 11:45.803
Until I get down
out of here!

11:45.872 --> 11:47.672
Now get me down
out of here!

11:47.741 --> 11:49.674
Yes, sir.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.310
Don't salute me!
Get me down from here!

11:59.719 --> 12:01.986
[Grunting]

12:08.829 --> 12:10.995
[Yelling]

12:16.503 --> 12:18.236
[Grunting]

12:18.305 --> 12:21.039
[Yelling]

12:43.697 --> 12:45.964
[Yelling]

12:47.767 --> 12:49.400
The killer.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.302
Voodoo.

12:51.371 --> 12:53.170
No bullets.

12:53.239 --> 12:54.238
Help.

12:54.307 --> 12:56.141
[Yelling]

12:59.712 --> 13:01.045
Help.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.152
[Screeching]

13:09.156 --> 13:10.121
Help!

13:14.995 --> 13:15.993
Help! Help!

13:16.062 --> 13:19.130
What is it?
A m-m-m-m--

13:19.198 --> 13:20.531
a monster! A monster!

13:20.600 --> 13:21.966
Will you get hold
of yourself?

13:22.035 --> 13:23.668
A monster in the hut?

13:23.737 --> 13:24.835
Yeah. Go get him.

13:24.904 --> 13:26.003
We'll investigate.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.771
You ready,
professor?

13:27.840 --> 13:29.707
Careful. Careful.
Careful.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.275
You got him.

13:31.343 --> 13:33.677
Gilligan, whatever it was
that attacked you is gone.

13:33.746 --> 13:34.712
You must have
been dreaming.

13:34.781 --> 13:35.779
No, no.
No dreaming!

13:35.848 --> 13:37.881
Aah!

13:37.950 --> 13:38.749
What happened?

13:38.818 --> 13:39.950
Tell us.

13:40.019 --> 13:41.452
All of a sudden,
a monster, 8 feet tall,

13:41.521 --> 13:42.853
came out of nowhere,
and he attacked me.

13:42.922 --> 13:44.955
And he had long arms
and claws

13:45.024 --> 13:46.457
and big yellow teeth.

13:46.525 --> 13:48.926
And I kept hitting him,
and it bounced off him.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.294
And his arms,
they're like steel,

13:50.363 --> 13:52.463
and they started
to squeeze me
and squeeze me.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.366
I don't know how I did it,
but I broke loose.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.067
Ginger,
isn't he marvelous?

13:57.136 --> 13:58.736
Now, hear this,
professor.

13:58.805 --> 14:02.540
I had some doubts before,
but now I'm positive
i know what it is.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.575
If you've been
sailing these waters
as long as I have,

14:04.644 --> 14:05.876
you'd be positive, too.

14:05.945 --> 14:07.378
It's voodoo.

14:07.447 --> 14:08.579
Voodoo?

14:08.648 --> 14:11.315
Oh, come now, skipper,
I'm a science teacher.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.284
You can't ask me
to believe in a thing
like voodoo.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.819
I knew a sailor once
that said that
to a witch doctor,

14:14.888 --> 14:16.153
and they never
saw him again.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.122
Aw, skipper.
Oh, I'm not through yet.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.590
They never
saw the sailor again,

14:19.659 --> 14:21.358
but the next day
in his hammock,
they found a parrot.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.361
The parrot kept saying
over and over again,

14:23.429 --> 14:26.030
"5-3-3-9-9-3."

14:26.099 --> 14:29.033
That was the sailor's
serial number.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.768
Well, I'm through now.

14:30.837 --> 14:32.503
Think I'm through, too.

14:34.574 --> 14:35.540
Gilligan!

14:41.915 --> 14:43.714
Professor,
it's getting
kind of late.

14:43.783 --> 14:45.716
Why don't we
call off the search
and go back to camp?

14:45.785 --> 14:48.419
Because the flare gun
is our only chance
to be rescued.

14:48.488 --> 14:51.289
Gilligan, only a coward
would quit at a time
like this.

14:51.357 --> 14:52.890
Oh. Well, would it
be alright
for the cowards

14:52.959 --> 14:54.558
to quit
and go back to camp?

14:54.627 --> 14:57.561
All this talk about voodoo
and witchcraft is ridiculous.

14:57.630 --> 15:01.131
Whatever you saw last night,
there is a simple,
logical explanation for it.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.500
Probably nothing more
than a monster.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.802
Gilligan,
there is no such thing
as a monster.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.270
Will you believe that?
I'll try, sir.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.872
I know what
I'm talking about.

15:07.941 --> 15:10.140
The only place you'll
ever find a monster
is in your mind.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.709
And the supply hut.

15:12.778 --> 15:15.880
You know, I think
we could cover more
ground if we split up.

15:15.948 --> 15:17.281
I'll go this way,
and you go that way.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.050
Wait a minute, professor.
Why don't we just

15:19.118 --> 15:21.118
kind of stay together
and kind of go this way?

15:21.187 --> 15:25.423
Gilligan, you're suffering
from anxieties activated
in your subconscious

15:25.491 --> 15:27.758
by a traumatic experience
last night,

15:27.827 --> 15:29.060
resulting in
withdrawal syndromes.

15:29.129 --> 15:30.694
Do you know
what that means?

15:30.763 --> 15:32.129
I'm chicken.

15:32.198 --> 15:33.865
You see what's off
in that direction,

15:33.933 --> 15:35.466
and I'll meet you
back at camp.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.404
Ah, wait a m-m-m-m...

15:44.878 --> 15:47.078
[Whistling]

15:51.418 --> 15:53.418
Whoa!

16:13.005 --> 16:14.672
[Yelling]

16:22.047 --> 16:23.348
[Yelling]

16:48.941 --> 16:52.176
What's the big Blaze
about, skipper?
It's hot enough.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.412
Nothing like a good fire
to keep the bugs away.

16:54.481 --> 16:55.646
Bugs?

16:55.715 --> 16:58.515
Mosquitoes, moths...
Zombies, vampires.

16:58.584 --> 17:00.651
I saw a picture called
<i> the land of the vampires</i>
once.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.387
They didn't build a fire
to chase away the monsters.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.555
They hung up pieces
of wolfsbane.

17:04.623 --> 17:06.022
Wolfsbane?

17:06.092 --> 17:07.858
That's Hollywood for you.

17:07.926 --> 17:10.260
Any fool knows that
wolfsbane's only used
against werewolves.

17:10.329 --> 17:11.729
It was
a very good picture.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.597
Well, maybe so, but a glaring
mistake like that

17:13.665 --> 17:14.998
makes the whole picture
unbelievable.

17:15.067 --> 17:16.599
I guess you're right,
skipper.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.603
Gee, you were in
<i> the land of the vampires,</i>

17:18.671 --> 17:19.637
weren't you, ginger?

17:19.705 --> 17:21.605
No. I was up
for a part,

17:21.674 --> 17:23.373
but I was
the wrong
blood type.

17:23.442 --> 17:24.708
Hi.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.009
Hi.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.944
Hi, professor.
Did you find anything?

17:28.013 --> 17:30.647
No. I must have
walked 20 miles.
Didn't see a thing.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.183
Where's gilligan?

17:32.251 --> 17:33.618
I thought
he'd be here.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.586
I was lost
for the last
couple of hours.

17:35.654 --> 17:37.721
Golly, do you suppose
that's what's happened
to gilligan?

17:37.790 --> 17:39.357
I don't know.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.259
Well, maybe we better look for
him before it gets too late.

17:41.327 --> 17:44.261
You're right, professor.
That poor kid will never
find his way back here.

17:44.330 --> 17:46.030
Tell you what,
we'll split up
into 3 groups.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.265
You and the girls
go out this way.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.935
I'll get the howells
and send them out
that way.

17:51.003 --> 17:53.704
Gilligan and i
will go right--

17:56.942 --> 17:58.575
a monkey?

17:58.644 --> 18:02.780
What's he doing
in gilligan's clothes?

18:02.849 --> 18:05.315
It's voodoo.

18:05.384 --> 18:08.386
They've changed gilligan
into a monkey.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.321
Speak to me,
little buddy,
speak to me.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.690
That's not gilligan.
That's a chimp.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.425
It's happened.

18:14.493 --> 18:16.159
I should never have let him
go into the jungle.

18:16.228 --> 18:17.294
That's not gilligan,
skipper.

18:17.363 --> 18:18.762
Of course not.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.965
Voodoo is just a lot of
superstitious nonsense.

18:21.034 --> 18:22.533
Oh, it is, huh?

18:22.601 --> 18:24.535
Well, I bet gilligan
has a different story
to tell.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.436
[Grunting]

18:26.505 --> 18:28.139
Oh, don't try
to talk now,
gilligan.

18:28.207 --> 18:29.573
You've been
through too much.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.775
Oh, skipper.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.042
There you are.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.110
I've been
waiting
all afternoon

18:33.178 --> 18:34.979
for that bamboo
you promised me.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.148
[Grunting]

18:37.216 --> 18:39.216
What's that monkey
doing here?

18:39.285 --> 18:40.551
Now, just a minute,
young fella.

18:40.619 --> 18:41.919
What are you doing
in gilligan's clothes?

18:41.987 --> 18:43.854
[Grunting]

18:43.923 --> 18:45.188
Mr. howell, it's voodoo.

18:45.257 --> 18:47.157
Good heavens.

18:47.226 --> 18:50.394
Well, some witch doctor
will have his license
revoked for this.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.996
Black magic,
i tell you--

18:52.064 --> 18:53.564
please, Mr. howell,
if you don't mind,

18:53.633 --> 18:55.232
I'd like to have
a minute alone with
my little buddy here.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.801
Yes, but--
please.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.270
Well...I...

19:06.346 --> 19:08.245
Gilligan...

19:08.314 --> 19:09.513
You want to get
in my lap? Alright.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.881
If you're more
comfortable that way.

19:10.950 --> 19:13.717
Gilligan, I know it's gonna be
hard for you

19:13.786 --> 19:16.119
to adjust to this
new way of life,

19:16.188 --> 19:18.455
but if you're
half the man that
i think you are,

19:18.524 --> 19:21.992
I know you'll
come through
with flying colors.

19:22.061 --> 19:25.429
I just can't bear
to see you
in those clothes.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.231
Gilligan.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.933
You know,
besides the fact--

19:30.002 --> 19:32.937
these clothes,
you won't need them,
in this condition.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.706
We'll give up the sea.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.041
[Screeching]

19:37.109 --> 19:40.143
Oh, gilligan.
Let me tell ya,

19:40.212 --> 19:43.747
I'm gonna make you happy
the rest of the days
of your life.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.983
We'll...We'll
get an apartment,

19:46.052 --> 19:48.018
one that takes monkeys.

19:48.086 --> 19:50.421
And I tell you what...

19:50.489 --> 19:52.890
I'll be your crew,
and you can be
the skipper.

19:54.761 --> 19:55.893
Gilligan!

19:55.962 --> 19:57.027
Gilligan,
wait a minute!

19:57.096 --> 19:58.129
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.064
Gilligan, come back!

20:00.133 --> 20:01.098
Wait!

20:01.167 --> 20:02.766
Gilligan!
Come back!

20:02.835 --> 20:04.235
Wait a minute,
little buddy!

20:14.780 --> 20:16.046
Ooh!

20:16.115 --> 20:17.448
Ow.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.521
Oh.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.399
Skipper?

20:37.837 --> 20:39.169
Skip--

20:39.238 --> 20:41.539
oh, what happened, huh?

20:42.908 --> 20:44.174
It's voodoo.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.176
You were right.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.078
Rather not
talk about it, huh?

20:48.147 --> 20:49.813
And you found
the flare gun, huh?

20:49.882 --> 20:52.516
Yeah, look. I found all
the rest of the stuff
that was stolen, huh?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.384
Well, you can check it
if you like.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.186
Did you tell them
back at camp
what happened yet?

20:56.255 --> 20:58.088
Huh? How about
that professor?

20:58.157 --> 20:59.389
Won't you have
a laugh on him

20:59.458 --> 21:02.660
when he sees you've been
turned into a monkey?

21:04.496 --> 21:06.663
Oh, no, skipper,
i wasn't laughing at you.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.532
I--i wasn't laughing
at you, skipper.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.034
No, skipper.
I wasn't laughing at you.

21:11.103 --> 21:11.735
Skipper?

21:11.804 --> 21:13.370
Skipper!

21:13.439 --> 21:15.539
Gilligan.
Skipper!

21:15.608 --> 21:18.442
Gilligan!
Gilligan! Ooh!

21:18.511 --> 21:20.143
The monster!
Help! The monster!

21:20.212 --> 21:22.880
Let go of me!
Let go!

21:22.949 --> 21:24.348
Help!

21:27.319 --> 21:29.753
Gilligan,
you're alright.

21:29.822 --> 21:31.221
So are you.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.122
I guess that spell
doesn't last, huh?

21:32.190 --> 21:33.757
Looks like it doesn't.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.693
Lucky for us the witch doctor
turned out to be a quack.

21:36.762 --> 21:40.598
Oh, gilligan,
this is the happiest
moment of my life.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.867
I want you to know
that every word I said,
i meant.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.735
Could you really
understand me,
little buddy?

21:44.804 --> 21:46.470
Not exactly. Could you
understand me?

21:46.539 --> 21:48.639
Well, not everything,
but--

21:48.708 --> 21:50.608
well, come on,
let's tell the others
about it.

21:52.511 --> 21:54.611
Mr. howell:
Don't panic.

21:54.680 --> 21:57.314
Lovey,
it is not a holdup.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.983
We were
in the jungle--

22:00.286 --> 22:01.718
hey, it's a chimp.

22:01.787 --> 22:03.887
Careful. It's got
the flare gun.
Give it back.

22:03.956 --> 22:06.457
Don't scare him. If we lose that
gun, we can't use the flares.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.725
I'll get it.
Get behind me.
Get behind me.

22:08.794 --> 22:10.561
I'll get it.
I'll get it...

22:10.630 --> 22:12.830
'Cause you're
my little pal,
aren't you?

22:12.898 --> 22:14.064
Huh, little pal?

22:14.133 --> 22:15.966
Don't point it--no.

22:16.035 --> 22:17.901
[Screeching]

22:17.970 --> 22:21.371
Stop laughing.
It's not funny.
I want the gun.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.673
Come on,
throw me the gun.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.643
What do you mean, no?

22:25.711 --> 22:28.278
Come on,
give me the gun.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.081
Skipper, throw me
a banana, huh?

22:33.386 --> 22:34.718
Yeah. Ready?

22:34.787 --> 22:38.322
I'll give it to you.
You give me the gun.

22:38.390 --> 22:40.290
I'll give you
the banana, see?

22:40.359 --> 22:41.892
If you give me the gun,

22:41.961 --> 22:43.327
I'll give you
the banana.

22:43.395 --> 22:45.362
Here we are.
Here's the banana.

22:45.431 --> 22:47.064
Now you give me the gun.

22:47.132 --> 22:49.033
Give me the gun.

22:49.101 --> 22:49.866
I got it!

22:49.935 --> 22:52.036
Good going!

22:52.104 --> 22:54.071
Good thinking!

22:54.139 --> 22:55.205
I hope
it still works.

22:55.273 --> 22:56.540
Oh, sure it does. See?

22:56.609 --> 22:58.241
Oh! Don't pull the...

22:58.310 --> 22:59.977
Trigger.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.311
The flares
are in there!

23:01.380 --> 23:03.447
Oh, I'll save 'em!

23:03.516 --> 23:04.748
Wait, gilligan!
It's too late!

23:04.817 --> 23:06.583
Ginger: Ooh.
Ooh, gilligan.

23:06.652 --> 23:08.686
Oh, don't go in there,
gilligan.

23:36.215 --> 23:39.449
Well, at least we know
the flare gun works.

23:39.518 --> 23:41.251
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...

23:41.320 --> 23:42.720
Gilligan!

23:49.495 --> 23:50.661
How lovely.

23:50.729 --> 23:52.095
Simply charming,
girls,

23:52.164 --> 23:53.763
I must say.
A luau.

23:53.832 --> 23:55.065
Ladies,
it looks
beautiful.

23:55.134 --> 23:56.934
Thank you.
Just sit right here, darling.

23:57.002 --> 23:58.635
I'll be
right over here.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.638
Oh, dazzling.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.542
[Screeching]

24:06.612 --> 24:08.446
Hey, gilligan,
where are you?

24:10.883 --> 24:12.716
Hey, what's
the big idea?

24:12.784 --> 24:15.419
Well, maybe we should
keep it this way.

24:15.488 --> 24:16.687
You seem to like me
better as a chimp.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.088
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...

24:18.157 --> 24:19.356
Gilligan.

24:19.425 --> 24:20.691
Come on over here.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.126
Tell him, skipper.

24:24.363 --> 24:27.097
Gilligan,
i want you to know
that you're forgiven.

24:27.165 --> 24:30.167
I may spout off at you,
but you're at the top
of the list with me.

24:30.236 --> 24:32.202
Skipper, you don't know
how much that means
to me,

24:32.271 --> 24:35.172
coming from a man
I'll always look up to.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.407
You mean that,
little buddy?

24:37.476 --> 24:39.243
You really
will always
look up to me?

24:43.182 --> 24:44.681
Way up.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.718
Gilligan,
get me down.
Gilligan.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.563
¶ Now, this is the tale
of our castaways ¶

24:59.631 --> 25:01.231
¶ they're here
for a long, long time ¶

25:01.300 --> 25:03.833
¶ they'll have to make
the best of things ¶

25:03.902 --> 25:05.736
¶ it's an uphill climb ¶

25:05.804 --> 25:07.771
¶ the first mate
and his skipper, too ¶

25:07.840 --> 25:09.940
¶ will do their very best ¶

25:10.008 --> 25:12.142
¶ to make the others
comfortable ¶

25:12.211 --> 25:14.444
¶ in their tropic
island nest ¶

25:14.513 --> 25:15.546
¶ no phones, no lights ¶

25:15.614 --> 25:16.646
¶ no motorcars ¶

25:16.715 --> 25:18.682
¶ not a single luxury ¶

25:18.751 --> 25:20.851
¶ like Robinson crusoe ¶

25:20.920 --> 25:22.953
¶ it's primitive as can be ¶

25:23.021 --> 25:25.155
¶ so join us here
each week, my friends ¶

25:25.224 --> 25:27.424
¶ you're sure
to get a smile ¶

25:27.493 --> 25:29.826
¶ for 7 stranded
castaways ¶

25:29.895 --> 25:32.062
¶ here on
gilligan's isle ¶
