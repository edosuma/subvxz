00:06.006 --> 00:07.633
- Thank you. Good night.
- Night.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.301
At last.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.128
Yes, I am sure.

00:47.673 --> 00:49.675
- You sure about what?
- Nothing.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.969
Thanks for coming at such short notice.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.887
- I know you don't usually work nights.
- That's all right.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.723
Alonso has saved
some chocolate gâteau for Poppy.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.809
Yes, lovely.

00:58.809 --> 01:02.646
Oh, Alonso. Thank you. That's amazing.
She's gonna love that.

01:02.646 --> 01:06.733
Well, then marry me. I cook, you eat.
We're perfect for each other.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.610
That is-- That's an interesting offer.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.571
I'll just discuss that
with your wife, will I?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.823
Just take him. He's yours.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.950
Word of warning,
he's got a very hairy back.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.994
- Really?
- You not staying for drinks?

01:16.994 --> 01:19.371
I can't. I've gotta go and drop
something off, but thanks.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.455
See you later, all right?

01:20.455 --> 01:22.291
- All right. Night, Lisa.
- Night. Thanks.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.294
Yeah.

01:26.670 --> 01:27.713
All right.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.883
I hate it when I miss her bedtime.
Was she okay?

01:30.883 --> 01:33.177
Yeah. She passed out
pretty much straightaway.

01:33.177 --> 01:34.553
She was a bit upset though?

01:34.553 --> 01:35.971
Nah, she was fine.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.308
Could you at least lie
and pretend that she did?

01:40.642 --> 01:41.768
Right. Sorry.

01:41.768 --> 01:44.521
Yeah, no, now that you mention it,
no, she was a little bit--

01:44.521 --> 01:46.023
<i>Too late. Okay, look,</i>

01:46.023 --> 01:48.859
I'll be home soon. I've gotta drop
something at Aunt Em's before tomorrow.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.736
- <i>What, now?</i>
- Yeah.

01:50.736 --> 01:53.071
Sorry, I don't really have a choice.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.699
But just, seriously, go to sleep.

01:55.699 --> 01:57.534
- <i>Yeah. Okay then.</i>
- Thanks.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.412
It's just that I've just finished
my new video, yeah.

02:00.412 --> 02:03.248
<i>I was hoping to show it to you
before I uploaded it to the channel.</i>

02:04.708 --> 02:05.876
Really?

02:05.876 --> 02:07.669
<i>Yeah. You know,
I could always send it over.</i>

02:07.669 --> 02:09.128
<i>You know, you could watch it on the bus.</i>

02:10.380 --> 02:11.965
Yeah. Yeah, that would be great.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.511
I better go, but look,
I'll be home before you know it.

02:15.511 --> 02:16.595
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay.

02:16.595 --> 02:17.679
- <i>Night.</i>
- Night.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.350
Wait, wait, wait! Hang on!

02:23.685 --> 02:24.520
For fu--

02:45.290 --> 02:47.084
<i>Hard floors? Simple.</i>

02:47.084 --> 02:49.586
<i>the SC 3 Upright EasyFix Steam Mop</i>

02:49.586 --> 02:53.006
<i>is the only mop you'll ever need
for your sealed hard floors,</i>

02:53.006 --> 02:56.093
<i>thanks to its simple to use
three-step flow control system.</i>

02:56.093 --> 03:00.806
<i>The SC 3 EasyFix can remove
the most stubborn of stains</i>

03:00.806 --> 03:03.684
<i>and 99% of household bacteria.</i>

03:03.684 --> 03:06.228
<i>And with a heat-up time
of only 30 seconds,</i>

03:06.228 --> 03:09.690
the EasyFix is ready to operate
in no time at all.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.568
<i>Just steam it, clean it, done.</i>

03:12.568 --> 03:15.362
<i>The SC 3 Upright EasyFix cleaner.</i>

03:15.362 --> 03:16.530
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

03:16.530 --> 03:20.242
<i>Hello, Vedge-fans, and welcome back
to another edition of</i>

03:20.242 --> 03:22.244
Unboxing for Unboxers.

03:22.244 --> 03:25.581
<i>Today, I'll be reviewing a product
that every unboxer needs</i>

03:25.581 --> 03:27.666
<i>if you wanna be taken seriously,</i>

03:27.666 --> 03:31.962
<i>the Sharptooth Box Blade 32AA box cutter.</i>

03:31.962 --> 03:35.007
<i>Not to be confused with
the Sharptooth Box Blade 32.</i>

03:35.007 --> 03:39.469
<i>I mean, it is the crème de la crème
of box cutters.</i>

03:39.469 --> 03:40.804
- Man, don't even--
- Fascinating.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.307
- <i>Okay, so let's talk specifics.</i>
- Oh, my gosh.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.058
- <i>The sleek, ergonomic...</i>
- Idiots.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.144
Bailey, did you hear what he said?

03:47.144 --> 03:49.730
- What you talking about?
- <i>...and it also creates grip, okay?</i>

03:50.230 --> 03:52.733
<i>Secondly,
let's talk about ceramic coating.</i>

03:54.818 --> 03:56.320
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Hello.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.113
- Okay, spill it.
- What?

03:58.113 --> 04:00.240
You've obviously got something
you wanna tell me. So, out with it.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.867
How did you get all that
from just "hello"?

04:02.451 --> 04:04.036
'Cause I'm fluent in Danny.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.747
Are you on a bus?

04:11.043 --> 04:11.877
Yeah.

04:11.877 --> 04:12.836
At half 11:00?

04:13.420 --> 04:15.714
- It's kind of a long story.
- Well, I'm not going anywhere.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.509
Well, basically, my Aunt Em died recently.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.928
- Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

04:21.553 --> 04:23.722
- Were you close?
- Yeah, we were actually.

04:23.722 --> 04:24.932
- Give me my shoe.
- No.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.725
<i>I wasn't always
the most popular girl at school.</i>

04:26.725 --> 04:27.643
- Missed again.
- Can I have it?

04:27.643 --> 04:29.228
- Just catch the thing.
- Stop!

04:29.228 --> 04:30.646
- If you want it, take it.
- Yes.

04:30.646 --> 04:32.314
No need to cry about it.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.362
Lisa, whatever's the matter?

04:39.321 --> 04:40.906
<i>But she was always there for me.</i>

04:40.906 --> 04:47.621
Glacier movements happen by
the process of abrasion, plucking and...

04:48.288 --> 04:49.498
Anyone else?

04:51.834 --> 04:52.835
Can I help you?

04:53.335 --> 04:54.545
I wouldn't have thought so.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.338
Which one of you is Melanie Bent?

04:59.174 --> 05:00.175
Right.

05:00.676 --> 05:03.470
<i>I mean, her methods
could be a little bit unorthodox.</i>

05:03.470 --> 05:04.888
Get off. What're you doing?

05:04.888 --> 05:07.015
- You're lucky I'm a pacifist.
- Get off!

05:07.015 --> 05:08.725
<i>But she was a hero to me.</i>

05:09.601 --> 05:10.894
<i>And so generous.</i>

05:10.894 --> 05:13.647
<i>Like, for my graduation,
she lent me her favorite dress.</i>

05:13.647 --> 05:14.815
<i>This green satin one.</i>

05:15.399 --> 05:17.192
<i>I loved that dress.</i>

05:17.192 --> 05:20.070
<i>But then I maybe sort of
forgot to give it back.</i>

05:20.070 --> 05:22.447
- You stole it?
- Little bit, yeah.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.242
No way. I'm not having that. No way.

05:26.660 --> 05:30.330
<i>It wasn't my fault. I was really forgetful
when I was younger.</i>

05:30.330 --> 05:32.541
Right. So what's that got to do
with you being on a bus?

05:32.541 --> 05:35.002
Okay, well, apparently Aunt Em
left strict instructions

05:35.002 --> 05:36.336
as to what she wanted to be buried in.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.088
- A coffin?
- <i>Obviously a coffin.</i>

05:38.088 --> 05:40.465
I mean, she wanted to be buried
wearing the dress.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.885
- <i>And the funeral's this week.</i>
- So what are you gonna do?

05:42.885 --> 05:44.928
- The right thing.
- Yeah? You're gonna come clean?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.013
- <i>No.</i>
- No.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.723
No, I've got the dress with me now.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.308
I'm taking it to Aunt Em's house.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.560
I'm gonna hide it,
but hide it really, really badly.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.562
And then tomorrow, they'll find it,

05:53.562 --> 05:55.606
and then everyone will live
happily ever after.

05:56.190 --> 05:57.524
<i>Except Aunt Em, obviously.</i>

05:57.524 --> 06:00.068
<i>Yeah. What were you gonna tell me earlier?</i>

06:00.068 --> 06:01.403
Oh, yeah.

06:02.446 --> 06:03.822
You remember that dating app
that you signed me up for?

06:04.489 --> 06:05.407
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.575
Well, I got a match.

06:07.451 --> 06:08.285
Really?

06:08.285 --> 06:10.037
Yes, really.
Can you not sound so surprised?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.831
- Well, what's her name?
- Amy.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.209
Okay. Well, that's great news.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.377
Yeah, it's good. But what happens next?

06:17.377 --> 06:19.296
You just send her a message
and say, "Hey."

06:21.089 --> 06:22.674
No, I can't do that.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.843
I can't get away with just a "hey".
I'm not a "hey" kind of person.

06:24.843 --> 06:27.221
Oh, my God, you're overthinking this.
Trust me.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.555
- Do you think?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

06:28.555 --> 06:30.390
- <i>Really?</i>
- Yeah.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.311
- <i>Go on.</i>
- Okay.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.320
- Sent.
- <i>Okay.</i>

06:43.320 --> 06:44.404
Well done.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.582
She hasn't responded.
Why hasn't she responded?

06:55.582 --> 06:56.667
That's you with the "hey".

06:56.667 --> 06:58.919
- "Do a little 'hey'."
- <i>It's been a minute. Give it a moment!</i>

07:03.340 --> 07:05.509
- It's her.
- <i>Well?</i>

07:06.009 --> 07:08.011
Okay. She wrote "hey" back.

07:09.221 --> 07:11.348
- That's it. And then "How was your day?"
- <i>There you go.</i>

07:11.348 --> 07:12.975
That's a good start, isn't it?

07:12.975 --> 07:15.727
Okay. Now tell her
what you got up to today.

07:17.479 --> 07:20.399
- I don't think I wanna do that.
- Why? What did you get up to today?

07:20.399 --> 07:22.109
I don't wanna tell you either.
You'll think I'm weird.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.194
- Danny, I already think you're weird.
- <i>That's fair.</i>

07:24.903 --> 07:25.988
So?

07:25.988 --> 07:26.905
Well...

07:34.329 --> 07:36.206
I tried to make a bust
of Michael Fassbender's head

07:36.206 --> 07:38.250
- out of some Blu Tack.
- Excuse me, what?

07:41.211 --> 07:42.296
<i>This is him in</i> X-Men.

07:42.296 --> 07:44.298
Why did you do that?

07:44.298 --> 07:47.843
I was in an arty mood.
And I just have way too much Blu Tack.

07:47.843 --> 07:50.679
<i>Yeah, you're right.
Definitely don't tell her about that.</i>

07:50.679 --> 07:51.972
<i>Then what do I do?</i>

07:53.515 --> 07:54.808
Well, just be yourself.

07:55.601 --> 07:56.810
Okay. Yeah, good point.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.605
Be almost yourself and just, like,
trim away the weird, little edges.

07:59.605 --> 08:02.441
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I could do that.

08:02.441 --> 08:06.028
- Are you talking about me?
- White suit, trousers-- Yes.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.613
Danny, can I call you back?

08:07.613 --> 08:09.907
No, you can't. Please. No.
What do I say to her?

08:09.907 --> 08:10.991
Yeah. I'll check in, I ju--

08:10.991 --> 08:12.451
You're meant to be my girl.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.457
- Did you just shush someone?
- <i>Yeah, I did just shush someone.</i>

08:18.457 --> 08:20.834
I don't think I've ever shushed anyone
in my life. My legs are shaking.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.212
I've never shushed anyone either.
I wish I was someone that could shush.

08:23.212 --> 08:24.296
I'm a bit jealous.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.008
- Danny, I've really gotta go.
- <i>No. Don't go.</i>

08:28.008 --> 08:29.551
- No. Wait. Don't--
- I'll call you back. Good luck.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.011
No. Lisa, no, plea-- I--

08:37.976 --> 08:40.854
<i>So, in terms of color, it comes in red,</i>

08:41.563 --> 08:46.610
<i>black, silver, green, lime green.</i>

08:47.194 --> 08:49.905
<i>Doesn't come in purple,
which I thought was a shame.</i>

09:08.924 --> 09:10.008
Do it.

09:12.302 --> 09:14.763
"Not bad. Thanks."

09:19.059 --> 09:20.686
"How about you?"

09:55.345 --> 09:59.516
<i>The recommended retail price
is higher than we all expected with this.</i>

09:59.516 --> 10:02.895
<i>But with the addition of the tape blade
down here</i>

10:02.895 --> 10:06.732
<i>and an additional blade
that can replace this blade once</i>

10:06.732 --> 10:08.650
it's been overused, you know what it--

10:27.419 --> 10:30.464
- Sorry. Have you seen a bag?
- There wasn't one here when I got on.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.233
Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

10:55.239 --> 10:56.240
Hi.

10:57.282 --> 10:58.700
- Hey. How's it going?
- Yeah. Good, good.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.203
- Is that my dress?
- Which dress?

11:02.037 --> 11:03.038
The dress you're wearing.

11:03.956 --> 11:05.040
- This dress?
- Yeah.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.835
Right. No, I don't think so.
I'm pretty sure it's my dress.

11:09.127 --> 11:12.589
Right. Okay, I'll put it another way.
That is my dress.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.801
Right. But I'm pretty sure it's my dress.
That's weird, isn't it?

11:15.801 --> 11:18.720
Right. But I think we both know
that it's not, don't we?

11:18.720 --> 11:19.972
Then how comes I'm wearing it?

11:21.473 --> 11:24.142
Okay. You've had your fun.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.894
Now it's time to give the dress back--

11:27.771 --> 11:32.150
Right. Okay. Yeah. Okay, I see what
this is about. I'm really sorry that--

11:36.405 --> 11:37.447
You can't just--

11:40.951 --> 11:42.119
Okay.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.501
- You won't believe it--
- She wants to meet up.

11:49.501 --> 11:51.879
- <i>What?</i>
- Amy. She wants to meet up in real life.

11:52.921 --> 11:53.922
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:55.424 --> 11:56.258
Well, I don't know.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.260
Maybe this is the thing that you need
to get back out there.

11:58.260 --> 12:00.470
But I don't wanna be back out there.
That's why I'm in here.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.097
<i>Maybe you could invite her round to yours.</i>

12:02.097 --> 12:04.433
- What? Like, won't she be in my flat?
- <i>Well, yeah.</i>

12:05.309 --> 12:07.895
<i>No, I don't think so. What if--
You know, what if it goes well?</i>

12:07.895 --> 12:09.229
- What if she wants to get intimate?
- <i>I mean,</i>

12:09.229 --> 12:10.856
do you need me to cover this
with you as well?

12:10.856 --> 12:12.482
- No, of course not. It's just--
- Good.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.818
If I remember correctly, when, you know...

12:14.818 --> 12:16.153
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- ...you know.

12:16.153 --> 12:18.238
- <i>What?</i>
- You have to get naked.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.408
Oh, yeah. No, no, I actually--
I put on more clothes.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.951
<i>It's just-- Listen.</i>

12:22.951 --> 12:25.204
<i>Don't spread this to anyone.</i>

12:25.204 --> 12:27.080
- When I was showering this morning...
- <i>Yeah?</i>

12:27.748 --> 12:28.916
...washing a personal place,

12:28.916 --> 12:30.167
Okay.

12:30.167 --> 12:33.629
- I found a mound.
- A mound?

12:33.629 --> 12:35.339
- I think it might be cancerous.
- <i>Danny--</i>

12:35.339 --> 12:37.841
- Actually, I know it's cancerous.
- No, it's not cancerous. What?

12:37.841 --> 12:38.926
- Would you take a look?
- What?

12:38.926 --> 12:41.678
Not like that. I just have--
I've taken a photo on my phone.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.597
- If you could take a look at it--
- No, I will not.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.806
Go and see a doctor.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.850
Yeah. No, well, I have. Sort of.

12:46.850 --> 12:49.728
Basically, I used to send a lot of photos
to my doctor. You know, save me going in.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.438
- Right.
- <i>Over the years,</i>

12:51.438 --> 12:54.608
<i>I may have sent quite a lot,
and she ended up sort of blocking me.</i>

12:54.608 --> 12:56.401
<i>Luckily, my neighbor Adam
offered to help out.</i>

12:56.401 --> 12:57.903
Please, do come in.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.781
Take a seat, please, Adam.

13:01.782 --> 13:02.783
Cheers.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.411
Okay. What appears to be the problem?

13:07.663 --> 13:08.622
Hold that thought.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.041
<i>Hi, Doctor. L-Listen to this.</i>

13:11.041 --> 13:13.043
<i>For some reason,
I can no longer taste pineapple.</i>

13:13.043 --> 13:15.212
<i>At first I thought it was a bad pineapple,
but very recently,</i>

13:15.212 --> 13:17.172
<i>I've had another,
and still I can't taste anything.</i>

13:17.172 --> 13:18.298
Okay.

13:19.550 --> 13:21.343
Let's just try this one last time,
shall we?

13:21.844 --> 13:25.013
Please do let me know if there's any part
of this that you struggle to understand.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.850
- Yep.
- Go away.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.478
Go away.

13:35.691 --> 13:38.068
- She threw you out?
- Well, technically she threw Adam out.

13:38.068 --> 13:41.071
You know? Look, if I just send you
this photo, please just take a look.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.865
And then tell me if it's something
or nothing.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.158
- Yes. Okay. I'll take a look at it.
- Yeah? Serious?

13:45.158 --> 13:47.077
- Yeah.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

13:47.661 --> 13:50.622
- There. It's sent. Are you okay?
- <i>No, I'm not okay.</i>

13:50.622 --> 13:52.958
- Someone's stolen my dress.
- I thought you stole your dress.

13:52.958 --> 13:56.420
No, I mean here. Right now.
They're wearing it in front of me.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.504
<i>Let's have a look.</i>

13:59.923 --> 14:01.508
Oh, yeah. He can really pull it off.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.386
Danny! Look, I need your help.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.597
- Okay, have you confronted him?
- Of course I confronted him.

14:06.597 --> 14:08.515
- <i>And what happened?</i>
- He shushed me.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.520
The shushee
becomes the shusher. A classic move.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.105
Oh, my God. You're not helping me at all.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.065
Okay, I've got it. You could start crying.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.734
No. I don't want to cause a scene.

14:18.734 --> 14:20.944
Lisa, he's the one causing a scene.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.363
You need to expose him.
Drag his crimes out into the light,

14:23.363 --> 14:25.240
and then make a podcast
about the whole ordeal.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.450
- What?
- <i>What I mean is,</i>

14:26.450 --> 14:28.243
<i>you need to get
the whole bus on your side.</i>

14:28.243 --> 14:29.786
People love getting outraged
at this stuff.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.539
Yeah, you're right.
You're right. I'm gonna bloody do it.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.999
You are gonna do it.
I can see it on your face.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.459
<i>I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna cause a scene.</i>

14:35.459 --> 14:36.585
- <i>You're gonna do it.</i>
- I'm bloody going.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.378
You're gonna-- She's gone.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.130
Hello. Hi, everyone.

14:40.130 --> 14:45.010
Sorry, I just wanted you all to know
that we have a thief on this bus.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.804
This person has stolen my dress.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.599
See that? That's the kind of dress
I wanted for my birthday.

14:50.599 --> 14:53.435
Well, then why tell me perfume?
I'm not a mind reader.

14:53.435 --> 14:57.523
Look, sorry, I know it's late and
everyone just really wants to get home,

14:57.523 --> 14:59.316
but I'd very much appreciate your help.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.859
Somebody must have seen something.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.863
- Anybody?
- Sorry, I don't mean to interfere--

15:04.863 --> 15:07.157
Oh, no, please do. Please interfere.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.826
But if that's not his dress,
then where are his other clothes?

15:09.826 --> 15:11.870
Well, I mean,
obviously it's gonna be under...

15:14.456 --> 15:15.290
Hey!

15:16.875 --> 15:18.210
Come on now. Obviously--

15:19.002 --> 15:21.630
- What do you think you're doing?
- Actually, do you know what?

15:21.630 --> 15:24.258
You are interfering. If you wouldn't mind
staying out of it, that would be great.

15:24.258 --> 15:25.843
Thank you.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.720
Don't worry, love. I'll believe ya!

15:29.555 --> 15:30.389
Thank you.

15:30.389 --> 15:32.432
Bloke wearing a dress.
Disgusting, if you ask me.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.142
Oh, no.

15:34.768 --> 15:36.144
Okay, no one listen to him.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.771
He's-- I'm not-- We're not--

15:38.355 --> 15:40.065
We are not on the same team.

15:42.901 --> 15:45.279
Of course, I believe that anyone
should be allowed to wear

15:45.279 --> 15:46.738
- whatever they wanna wear.
- Great. Thanks.

15:46.738 --> 15:49.908
Yeah, just, in this situation,
that actually is my dress.

15:49.908 --> 15:54.204
Our plumber wears lipstick.
I still give him fruitcake.

15:57.666 --> 15:58.667
No, that's not--

15:59.334 --> 16:00.586
No.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.007
<i>Hey, how'd it go?</i>

16:05.007 --> 16:08.468
Yeah, not great. I pretty much
turned most of the bus against me.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.053
But you were meant to turn them
against him.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.763
- I know that. Thanks, Danny.
- <i>It's okay.</i>

16:11.763 --> 16:13.265
Okay? We'll think of something.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.147
While we're thinking, I don't suppose you
could tell me that I don't have cancer?

16:20.147 --> 16:21.899
I already told you
I don't think you have cancer.

16:21.899 --> 16:24.109
Yeah, but what did it look like to you?

16:24.109 --> 16:25.903
Well, I don't know.
It hasn't come through yet.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.448
What do you mean? I sent it to you
ages ago. You should--

16:31.700 --> 16:33.076
- What?
- Oh, no.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.996
- <i>Danny, what? What?</i>
- Oh, no. God, no.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.040
Amy. I sent the picture to Amy.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.416
Well, don't laugh.

16:39.416 --> 16:41.793
- <i>What are you laughing for?</i>
- Okay, well, that's fine.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.670
No, it's not fine.
In what world is this fine?

16:43.670 --> 16:44.755
<i>It's bold.</i>

16:44.755 --> 16:46.006
It's saying,

16:46.006 --> 16:47.841
- "Do you know what? Screw small talk."
- <i>Yeah.</i>

16:47.841 --> 16:49.384
- "Let's just cut to the chase."
- <i>To the chase.</i>

16:49.384 --> 16:51.595
"Do you like my body?
Also, do you think I have cancer?

16:51.595 --> 16:53.347
And if the answer is 'yeah' and then 'no,'

16:53.347 --> 16:55.682
- <i>let's just bloody get together."</i>
- Together.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.768
Look, the upside is,

16:57.768 --> 17:00.479
<i>if she gets back to you,
you know you've found a keeper.</i>

17:00.479 --> 17:03.190
No, Lisa, if she gets back to me,
she should be certified insane.

17:03.774 --> 17:06.318
Yeah. Well, then that's another thing
you have in common.

17:16.453 --> 17:17.704
You idiot.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.100
So, this is your forever, is it?

17:41.061 --> 17:42.187
You in this flat.

17:52.322 --> 17:53.156
Do it.

18:01.957 --> 18:05.043
Okay. Yeah. That's not so bad.

18:07.713 --> 18:09.006
Jesus Christ!

18:16.805 --> 18:18.473
<i>Hey. You don't know how to ask a pigeon</i>

18:18.473 --> 18:20.475
- <i>to leave your flat by any chance, do you?</i>
- What?

18:22.603 --> 18:23.437
Never mind.

18:24.438 --> 18:26.356
- You okay?
<i>- Not really.</i>

18:26.356 --> 18:27.691
Did Amy get back to you?

18:27.691 --> 18:29.359
Funnily enough, she didn't.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.278
- This way.
- <i>Oh, no. Sorry.</i>

18:31.278 --> 18:32.529
Did you get your dress back?

18:32.529 --> 18:33.822
No, I did not.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.616
Look, there's gotta be
something you can do.

18:35.616 --> 18:37.367
There's not. I've got nothing.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.746
<i>I just wish Aunt Em was here.
She'd know what to do in this situation.</i>

18:41.914 --> 18:45.083
Well, given what you've told me about her,

18:45.083 --> 18:47.461
she would have just
ripped the dress off his back, right?

18:49.087 --> 18:50.422
Get off.

18:54.176 --> 18:56.178
Never let the bastards win, Lisa.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.564
Of course.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.859
- <i>Oh, my God, that's it.</i>
- What?

19:12.819 --> 19:13.820
Okay, come with me.

19:14.446 --> 19:15.447
Well, where are we going?

19:46.979 --> 19:48.230
Could you move, please? This is my stop.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.858
I just want to let you know
that you are a horrible person,

19:50.858 --> 19:52.442
and that you have dragged me down to this.

19:52.442 --> 19:56.029
And I want everyone here and everyone
who's going to watch this online

19:56.029 --> 19:59.408
to know that what is about to happen next
is because of this person.

19:59.992 --> 20:02.619
<i>Yeah. Screw you, man.
Sorry, I didn't catch your name.</i>

20:03.495 --> 20:04.329
Tyler.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.831
Thanks. Screw you, Tyler.

20:05.831 --> 20:07.624
Yeah. Screw you, Tyler.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.669
Would you please point this at me?
It's recording.

20:11.170 --> 20:12.796
- What?
- Danny will explain.

20:14.006 --> 20:15.465
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

20:15.465 --> 20:17.718
I think we're just supposed to do
what we're told.

20:20.429 --> 20:21.430
Are we ready?

20:22.890 --> 20:23.891
No!

20:33.817 --> 20:34.651
Okay.

20:53.629 --> 20:55.088
I'll keep going.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.301
He's uncomfortable.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.272
Okay.

21:13.065 --> 21:15.859
- What you doing?
- This isn't worth the hassle, man.

21:17.819 --> 21:20.864
Look, it's getting pretty cold out there,
so if you're gonna be a nutter about it,

21:20.864 --> 21:23.033
then you should probably take this.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.411
Thank you very much.

21:26.411 --> 21:27.996
I've got some extra clothes
with me anyway. So...

21:30.207 --> 21:31.333
Thought you might.

21:55.023 --> 21:56.400
Piss off.

21:59.945 --> 22:01.071
Oh, come on.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.622
Bye.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.958
- Better luck next time.
- Whatever.

22:12.958 --> 22:14.793
Oh, my God. Did you see me?

22:15.752 --> 22:18.589
That is the coolest thing
I think I have ever done.

22:18.589 --> 22:20.340
Yeah. It was amazing.

22:20.340 --> 22:24.094
- Oh, shit. This isn't my stop.
- <i>What?</i>

22:26.930 --> 22:27.931
<i>What was that?</i>

22:30.142 --> 22:31.435
Trust me. You don't wanna know.

22:33.478 --> 22:36.023
<i>Tell me again how this isn't breaking
and entering.</i>

22:36.773 --> 22:38.400
Because I'm using a key.

22:38.400 --> 22:41.528
Will you just relax?
I'll be in and out in a minute.

22:41.528 --> 22:44.740
Then I've gotta get back and find my shoes
before someone puts them on eBay.

22:44.740 --> 22:46.700
Look, I'll call you back when I'm done.

23:11.475 --> 23:12.935
You've gotta be kidding me.

23:17.356 --> 23:19.316
- <i>I have some excellent news.</i>
- <i>Hit me.</i>

23:19.316 --> 23:20.400
It's just an ingrown hair.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.110
- What?
- Amy, she got back to me.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.695
<i>No. Seriously?</i>

23:23.695 --> 23:25.489
Trust me, nobody's more surprised
than I am.

23:25.489 --> 23:26.990
Okay, well, what did she say?

23:26.990 --> 23:29.743
Well, just that it's a beautiful,
nonlethal, ingrown hair.

23:29.743 --> 23:31.245
I'm not dying, Lisa.

23:32.579 --> 23:33.747
Well, that is great, Danny.

23:34.498 --> 23:35.707
Hold on. What are you wearing?

23:36.625 --> 23:39.461
Well, it turns out that most
of Aunt Em's stuff was in storage,

23:39.461 --> 23:43.131
so now I'm dressed like a '70s sofa.

23:43.131 --> 23:44.508
No, it's a good look. A strong look.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.134
Yeah, whatever. All right, I better go.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.886
- Same time next time?
- Same time next time.

23:47.886 --> 23:48.971
<i>See you later.</i>

23:51.473 --> 23:52.474
Hello, again.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.276
Rest in peace, you crazy bird.

24:23.213 --> 24:24.590
Godspeed, little guy.

24:44.026 --> 24:45.277
You've got to be kidding me.
