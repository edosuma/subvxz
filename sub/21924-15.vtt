00:06.715 --> 00:08.633

the scholarship or not,

00:08.758 --> 00:09.843

00:09.968 --> 00:11.970
 Well, I've decided.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.054
I'm going to go.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.055
 I'm going to miss you.

 Yeah, me, too.

 You have to meet my daughter.

Uh, Peyton.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.649
 Lainy, meet Georgie.

00:24.774 --> 00:27.652
 So, how do you
two know each other?

00:27.777 --> 00:29.654
 Oh, we just met.

00:29.779 --> 00:32.031
Her trainer is the one who's
been working with my horse.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.867
 Oh, you mean the
one who thought

00:33.992 --> 00:37.203
he should be a rodeo bronc.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.539
 I'm feeling better.

00:39.664 --> 00:42.917
So I can be
cautiously optimistic.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.587
That's what Dr. Randy told me.

you're all warmed up.

One more lap, and
then bring it in.

01:16.326 --> 01:17.285
Time to do the chorus.

 Don't worry, he's not here.

He's out of town for a few days.

 Oh, I wasn't worried about
running into him or anything.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.135
I just-- I was
looking for your mom.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.428
I wanted to thank her.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.055
It's amazing she's
letting me train here.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.265
 Yeah, I'll let her know.

01:39.391 --> 01:40.850
She usually lets family
and close friends

01:40.975 --> 01:44.229
train in our arena, but I
guess she made an exception.

You want to stick around for
the rest of the practice?

I could probably use your help.
- Yeah, sure.

could use a couple of pointers.

on a rodeo scholarship

02:36.573 --> 02:38.199

behavior from your horse

04:23.888 --> 04:25.098
before.

He's far too dangerous to
have around other horses

- Yeah.

that other horse?

Lou how to do it

so she would carry it on.

see the recipe except for Lou.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.576
 Yikes.

09:36.701 --> 09:37.786
He must've been
really out of control.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.120
 Yeah.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.706
But not on course, just
around other horses.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.084
 Well, that's not good.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.293
 Yeah.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.629
But there's something
different about him.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.963
I don't know.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.340
He seems like a
really great horse,

09:50.465 --> 09:53.677
so I got thinking maybe
you could work with him?

09:53.802 --> 09:55.762
 Georgie, do you
remember the last time I

09:55.887 --> 09:57.764
worked with a Westfield horse?

09:57.889 --> 09:59.891
 You made them realize
what he was meant for.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.476
 No.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.270
I made them realize how they
could make more money off him.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.147
 OK.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.693
Well, I just-- I really think
this horse could use your help.

10:09.818 --> 10:10.819
 Why do you all
of a sudden want

10:10.944 --> 10:13.071
to go out on a limb for Peyton?

10:13.196 --> 10:15.240
 I know Peyton is
not my favorite person

10:15.365 --> 10:20.870
but, believe me, I think she
really cares about this horse.

10:20.995 --> 10:21.996
 OK.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.248
Well, have her
bring the horse by.

10:23.373 --> 10:25.000
All right?

10:25.125 --> 10:27.127
I will take a look at it,
that is, if she wants me to.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.086
 Thank you.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.004
I'll try.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.259
 Hey.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.928
You know Thanksgiving
is Lou's big day?

10:37.053 --> 10:39.389
Are you absolutely sure
she's OK with us going ahead

10:39.514 --> 10:40.640
without her?

10:40.765 --> 10:42.434
 Of course I am.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.603
We can't always be in the
same place at the same time.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.273
And we have to keep
traditions alive.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.150
 Like Lyndy's stuffing?

10:50.275 --> 10:52.277
The signature-family
Thanksgiving

10:52.402 --> 10:56.614
dish that Lou is not super
keen to give me the recipe for.

10:56.740 --> 10:57.991
 Well, she said that?

10:58.116 --> 10:59.159
 No.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.452
But I did text her
right after Tim left.

11:00.577 --> 11:01.619
And I haven't heard a peep.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.204
 You texted?

11:03.329 --> 11:06.624
Why don't people
want to call and just

11:06.750 --> 11:10.045
have a conversation anymore?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.172
I'm sure she'll get back to you.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.173
 OK.

11:13.298 --> 11:16.384
[music playing]

11:20.764 --> 11:22.682
 Hey, kid.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.642
 Jade, welcome back.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.102
 Thank you.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.063
It feels so good to be home.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.814
I went by the rodeo
grounds this afternoon.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.566
And Tim seems to be
back on his game.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.360
 What do you mean?

11:33.485 --> 11:34.736
 Well, I have to admit, I was
starting to wonder if something

11:34.861 --> 11:36.488
was up with him before I left.

11:36.613 --> 11:43.036
He just seemed so, I don't
know, not himself, you know.

11:43.161 --> 11:46.081
You must have noticed that too.

11:46.206 --> 11:46.873
 Yeah.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.209
Maybe a little.

11:49.334 --> 11:49.918
 OK.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.836
Now you're acting weird.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.254
 What are you talking about?

11:53.380 --> 11:54.381
 I don't know.

11:54.506 --> 11:55.924
You tell me.

11:56.049 --> 11:59.177
Is something up with Tim?

11:59.302 --> 12:00.095
 OK.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.721
You're kind of freaking me out.

12:01.846 --> 12:02.764
What is it?

12:02.889 --> 12:03.765
 It's nothing.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.308
It's probably nothing.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.561
 Georgie, what are
you talking about?

12:08.687 --> 12:10.855
 I'm not supposed
to say anything.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.274
 Well, too late now.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.526
Just tell me.

12:14.651 --> 12:17.445
[music playing]

12:18.947 --> 12:21.324
 Like I said, it's
probably nothing.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.785
But these weird
things were happening

12:23.910 --> 12:27.956
so he had an MRI done.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.958
 He had a brain scan?

12:30.083 --> 12:30.875
 Yeah.

12:31.001 --> 12:33.044
And they found something.

12:33.169 --> 12:36.297
And they're still
not sure what it is.

12:36.423 --> 12:39.384
You can't tell him
I told you anything.

12:39.509 --> 12:42.971
[music playing]

12:53.690 --> 12:54.858
 What's going on?

12:54.983 --> 12:57.569
 Well, apparently
these are for you.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.279
 Wyatt, seriously?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.281
 Well, that boy is not afraid
to go over the top, is he?

13:01.406 --> 13:02.073
 Yeah.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.409
I don't know what to say.

13:04.534 --> 13:05.618
 I think it's very sweet.

13:05.744 --> 13:06.703
What do you want us to
do with them, honey?

13:06.828 --> 13:07.662
 Oh.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.205
I don't know.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.290
Amy is out there training
with Peyton's horse.

13:10.415 --> 13:11.249
 OK.

13:11.374 --> 13:12.334
Well, go.

13:12.459 --> 13:13.501
And we'll put them in vases.
- Oh.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.461
Are you sure?

13:14.586 --> 13:16.046
 Yeah.

13:16.171 --> 13:16.921
And don't be overwhelmed,
he's just showing you

13:17.047 --> 13:17.756
how much he likes you.

13:17.881 --> 13:18.715
 OK.

 Hi.

 How's it going?

13:40.487 --> 13:41.321
 I don't know.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.864
Amy watched me ride for a while.

13:42.989 --> 13:43.990
And then she wanted to
go back to the barn,

13:44.115 --> 13:45.700
said she wanted
to try something.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.369
Hopefully she doesn't want to
turn Tyson into a rodeo bronc

13:47.494 --> 13:48.870
as well.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.163
 Amy is good at what she does.

13:50.288 --> 13:51.706
And she was right
about Holloway.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.624
 Yeah.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.001
I guess.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.044
Hey, can I ask you a question?

13:56.169 --> 13:56.795
 Yeah.

13:56.920 --> 13:57.962
Sure.

13:58.088 --> 13:59.756
 Why are you doing this?

13:59.881 --> 14:01.216
 Doing what?

14:01.341 --> 14:05.637
 Being so helpful or whatever.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.013
 I just--

14:07.138 --> 14:08.515
I think Amy could
really help your horse.

14:08.640 --> 14:09.849
That's all.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.351
I've got to go on
meeting my boyfriend.

You have a boyfriend?
- Yeah.

 See, this is what he does.

 It's OK.

14:46.761 --> 14:47.595
He's calming down.

14:47.721 --> 14:48.430
You need to do the same.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.389
 Yeah.

14:49.514 --> 14:50.724
But I can't.

14:50.849 --> 14:53.601
I just-- I get so freaked
out when he does that.

14:53.727 --> 14:55.353
 The sooner you can
control your emotions,

14:55.478 --> 14:57.230
the sooner you can
control your horse.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.232
You make it sound so easy
but how am I supposed to stay

calm when he gets like that?

15:00.984 --> 15:02.027
 I want to try a
technique that'll

15:02.152 --> 15:03.611
help you connect with him.

I'm going to put some of
our horses in the pen there.

Tyson around with them.

to help me again today.

 Well, I was up
late last night.

And ever since I've been
home, I've been thinking.

15:39.022 --> 15:42.817
And I don't know.

Where is this coming from?

Because yesterday, everything
was great in Texas.

16:02.879 --> 16:03.713

of quitting, are you?

you're dealing with all this

like such an idiot.

have been enough.

would be nicer.

I don't know what to say.

 Maybe thank you?

planned for us for tonight.

for dinner in the city

 It is.

 OK.

We could check it out.

 It's going to be good.

I'll pick you up at 6:00, OK?

18:07.253 --> 18:10.548
I'm keeping his mind
off the other horses.

18:10.674 --> 18:11.549
There you go.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.053
Easy.

18:15.178 --> 18:15.929
Hey.

18:16.054 --> 18:16.971
Hey.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.057
That's enough.

18:19.182 --> 18:20.809
There we go.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.103
The more I do this, the more
he realizes that his behavior

18:23.228 --> 18:24.479
won't be tolerated.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.273
I'm just redirecting his energy.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.149
 OK.

18:28.274 --> 18:28.983
So what are you saying?

18:29.109 --> 18:30.068
I'm the problem?

18:30.193 --> 18:31.403
 That's not the point.

18:31.528 --> 18:33.363
There is no one to blame.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.240
I just want you to
see what's possible.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.741
You can do this.

18:36.866 --> 18:38.326
OK?

18:38.451 --> 18:40.328
You can take control of
your horse in any situation

18:40.453 --> 18:42.330
but you need to believe that.

18:48.128 --> 18:51.006
 Hey, Georgie.

18:51.131 --> 18:52.549
You told Jade.

18:52.674 --> 18:53.508
Why?

18:56.803 --> 18:58.096
 She was all over me.

18:58.221 --> 19:00.181
She noticed the way you
were acting before she left.

19:00.306 --> 19:01.599
And she knew something was up.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.768
So she asked me point blank.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.020
What was I supposed to do?

19:05.145 --> 19:05.979
Lie about something
this serious?

19:06.104 --> 19:06.938
 No.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.273
No.

19:08.398 --> 19:09.315
 I just couldn't do it.

19:09.441 --> 19:13.361
 Georgie, I'm sorry.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.947
I shouldn't have put
you in that position.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.657
I should have told her myself.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.535
[music playing]

19:28.460 --> 19:31.379
 See, those horses
aren't going to hurt you.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.213
Let's try that again.

19:32.339 --> 19:35.300
[music playing]

19:36.968 --> 19:39.012
 Hi.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.388
Amy is really good.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.139
 Yeah.

19:41.264 --> 19:43.016
I know.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.602
 Hey, so a couple of the
girls from my riding club

19:45.727 --> 19:48.605
are going to go out tonight,
maybe make some junk food

19:48.730 --> 19:51.691
and rent a bad movie
if you want to join.

19:51.816 --> 19:52.817
 Oh.

19:52.942 --> 19:55.403
That sounds fun,
but my boyfriend has

19:55.528 --> 19:56.321
this big dinner date planned.

19:56.446 --> 19:57.489
 Oh.
Yeah?

19:57.614 --> 19:58.365
Maggie's?

19:58.490 --> 19:59.908
 Oh.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.659
No, a French restaurant in
Calgary called La Maison.

20:01.785 --> 20:03.078
 Oh.
Really?

20:03.203 --> 20:04.079
My parents go there a lot.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.038
It's supposed to be incredible.

20:05.163 --> 20:05.997
 Oh.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.082
That's impressive.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.333
 Hey, Peyton.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.919
You want to give it a try?

20:11.044 --> 20:11.920
 Yeah.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.547
[music playing]

20:17.300 --> 20:18.385
 OK.

20:18.510 --> 20:19.803
I want you to take
it slow but walk

20:19.928 --> 20:24.182
Tyson as close to the
other horses as you can.

20:24.307 --> 20:25.266
 Whoa, Tyson.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.768
 Don't let him do that, Peyton.

20:26.893 --> 20:27.686
Take control.

20:27.811 --> 20:28.645
 Tyson.

20:28.770 --> 20:29.354
 All right.

20:29.479 --> 20:30.772
Circle him around.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.607
 Easy, buddy.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.943
 Peyton, you need to be
confident in your commands.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.113
He needs to know what
you're asking him to do.

20:38.238 --> 20:39.948
 Whoa, buddy.

20:40.073 --> 20:42.784
[horse neighing]

20:44.869 --> 20:45.620
 Whoa.
Whoa.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.621
Easy.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.248
Easy.

20:48.373 --> 20:49.165
You're fine.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.125
You're OK.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.918
You need to settle down.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.211
Settle down.

20:53.336 --> 20:54.462
Whoa, boy.

20:58.800 --> 21:02.762
He needs to know
that you're the boss.

21:02.887 --> 21:03.805
Whoa, Tyson.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.143
Easy.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.937
There you go.

21:11.062 --> 21:13.231
Easy, buddy.

21:13.356 --> 21:14.899
OK.

21:15.025 --> 21:15.859
Once more.

21:15.984 --> 21:16.735
 No.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.028
Forget it.

21:18.153 --> 21:18.987
I'm done.

21:22.157 --> 21:24.492
 Peyton, come on.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.994
You did it.
- No.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.287
You did.

21:27.412 --> 21:28.329
If you weren't
there, he probably

21:28.455 --> 21:29.289
would've attacked your horse.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.207
I completely froze up again.

21:31.332 --> 21:32.334
 OK.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.085
Don't be so hard on yourself.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.629
It's not easy to change the
dynamics of any relationship

21:36.755 --> 21:39.007
but we'll get there, right?

21:42.677 --> 21:44.554
 I can help put Tyson in
the trailer if you want?

21:44.679 --> 21:45.305
 OK.

21:45.430 --> 21:46.473
Thanks.

21:51.227 --> 21:52.479
 Hey.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.314
How's it going with
that jumping horse?

21:54.439 --> 21:56.358
 Well, I thought we
were making progress

21:56.483 --> 21:57.901
but then he just blew up again.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.527
 Oh.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.529
 I just hope I'm not pushing
them too fast, you know.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.239
 How do you mean?

22:03.365 --> 22:07.160
 Well, the horse has aggression
issues with other horses.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.704
And I think it stems from the
rider's lack of confidence

22:09.829 --> 22:12.540
and her frustration with him.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.377
So I tied a bunch of
our horses off in a pen

22:15.502 --> 22:17.420
and just threw them in.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.506
 Where did you get
the idea to do that?

22:19.631 --> 22:21.257
 I read it in mom's journal.

22:21.383 --> 22:24.219
 I'm not surprised.

22:24.344 --> 22:28.807
You know what horse she used
that idea with the first time?

22:28.932 --> 22:30.016
Paint.

22:30.141 --> 22:30.892
 Really?

22:31.017 --> 22:32.352
 Yeah.

22:32.477 --> 22:33.812
He had the same issues
when he was young.

22:36.606 --> 22:38.566
 I didn't even know that.

22:38.692 --> 22:40.360
 It got to the
point where I wanted

22:40.485 --> 22:43.822
to spur the hide right of
him, make him know who's boss.

22:43.947 --> 22:44.739
 Grandpa.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.241
 I know.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.534
I know.

22:47.659 --> 22:50.537
That's exactly
how your mom felt.

22:50.662 --> 22:53.331
So she did this
exercise where you

22:53.456 --> 22:55.417
tie the horses off in the pen.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.043
 Did it work?

22:57.168 --> 22:58.461
 Not at first.

22:58.586 --> 23:00.422
He was pretty high strung.

23:00.547 --> 23:03.341
I was frustrated but--

23:03.466 --> 23:11.141
well, funny thing, once I
calmed down, Paint calmed down.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.560
 So you think I'm going
about this the right way.

23:13.685 --> 23:16.438
 Well, it sure worked
for me and Paint.

23:16.563 --> 23:19.941
 I guess, I should know better
than to question mom's ideas,

23:20.066 --> 23:21.109
right?

23:21.234 --> 23:22.110
 Or your own.

23:22.235 --> 23:25.113
[music playing]

23:29.284 --> 23:30.118
 OK.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.161
I'm here.

23:31.286 --> 23:32.078
What do you want to tell me?

23:34.956 --> 23:35.707
 All right.

23:35.832 --> 23:40.086
First, I want to apologize.

23:40.211 --> 23:43.715
But Jade, I hope that
you can understand

23:43.840 --> 23:46.468
why I didn't say anything.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.928
I've been waiting
for test results.

23:49.054 --> 23:51.389
I figured, why tell
anyone anything

23:51.514 --> 23:54.976
unless the news is bad.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.187
But my symptoms
are getting better.

23:57.312 --> 23:58.980
Everything's starting to
point in the right direction.

23:59.105 --> 24:00.690
Your mother even
said so herself.

24:00.815 --> 24:01.816
 OK.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.318
But what is this
thing in your brain?

24:03.443 --> 24:05.153
What if it's really bad?

24:05.278 --> 24:07.322
And what if it doesn't go away?

24:07.447 --> 24:09.491
And what if I never found out?

24:09.616 --> 24:11.493
And you set this whole thing up.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.871
And you pushed me as
far away as possible.

24:14.996 --> 24:17.749
And how do you think I would
have felt if I was in Texas,

24:17.874 --> 24:20.043
clueless, having
the time of my life,

24:20.168 --> 24:23.171
while you're back
here possibly--

24:23.296 --> 24:24.172
 Dying.

24:24.297 --> 24:27.175
[music playing]

24:30.595 --> 24:32.931
 I didn't think it through.

24:33.056 --> 24:34.432
 I never would have
forgiven myself.

24:34.557 --> 24:37.602
[music playing]

24:49.280 --> 24:51.199
 Thank you.

24:51.324 --> 24:52.158
 Thanks.

24:52.283 --> 24:55.203
[music playing]

24:56.830 --> 24:57.914
 Wow.

24:58.039 --> 25:01.876
This place is fancier
than I expected.

25:02.002 --> 25:03.962
You know, even
Peyton was impressed

25:04.087 --> 25:05.463
that you're bringing me here.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.340
 Sounds like you guys are
getting pretty friendly.

25:07.465 --> 25:08.383
No.

25:08.508 --> 25:10.343
I wouldn't go that far.

25:10.468 --> 25:13.596
But I think, I'm starting to
see a whole new side of her.

25:13.722 --> 25:16.057
Maybe there's more to
her than meets the eye.

25:16.182 --> 25:16.808
 Bonjour.

25:16.933 --> 25:19.144
Welcome to La Maison.

25:19.269 --> 25:21.980
May I suggest the chef's
inspired three-course meal

25:22.105 --> 25:23.189
this evening.

25:23.314 --> 25:24.941
It starts with the
choice of a house salad

25:25.066 --> 25:27.736
or delicious butternut
squash soup, followed

25:27.861 --> 25:29.404
by bruschetta and canapes.

25:29.529 --> 25:33.199
And finally, a beautiful
filet mignon for your entree.

25:33.324 --> 25:34.701
 Wow.

25:34.826 --> 25:36.327
I don't think I've ever
had any of that before,

25:36.453 --> 25:37.871
but it all sounds so good.

25:37.996 --> 25:39.372
 Excellent choice,
Mademoiselle.

25:39.497 --> 25:42.208
With the soup or salad?

25:42.334 --> 25:45.211
And for you?

25:45.337 --> 25:47.797
 The salad.

25:47.922 --> 25:49.382
 With the three-course
meal as well?

25:49.507 --> 25:50.842
 No, just the salad, please.

25:54.554 --> 25:57.640
 Can I get you both started
with something to drink?

25:57.766 --> 26:00.518
 I'll have the
Italian soda, please.

26:00.643 --> 26:01.853
 Just water, please.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.563
 Sparkling or still?

26:03.688 --> 26:04.898
 Tap?

26:05.023 --> 26:05.940
 Of course.

26:06.066 --> 26:08.568
[music playing]

26:16.201 --> 26:18.161
 The filet mignon
for, Mademoiselle.

26:18.286 --> 26:19.621
 Thank you.

26:19.746 --> 26:22.707
 And for Monsieur, the salad.

26:22.832 --> 26:23.917
 Thank you.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.001
 Fresh cracked pepper?

26:25.126 --> 26:25.877
 No.

26:26.002 --> 26:26.878
Thank you.

26:27.003 --> 26:27.545
 No.

26:27.671 --> 26:29.047
Thank you.

26:29.172 --> 26:30.423
But can I just have
some more bread, please?

26:30.548 --> 26:31.633
 Of course.

26:35.553 --> 26:36.429
 OK.

26:36.554 --> 26:37.806
Let's dig in.

26:41.935 --> 26:42.602
 Cheers.

26:42.727 --> 26:43.770
 Cheers.

26:47.524 --> 26:48.316
 Oh.

26:48.441 --> 26:49.275
Lasagna.

26:49.401 --> 26:51.152
It smells delicious.

26:51.277 --> 26:51.986
 It does, doesn't it?

26:52.112 --> 26:52.821
Yeah.

26:52.946 --> 26:54.114
Well, it's Lou's recipe.

26:54.239 --> 26:56.074
I hope she doesn't
mind I used it.

26:56.199 --> 26:57.200
 Oh.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.785
She still hasn't
replied to your email?

26:58.910 --> 26:59.619
 No.

26:59.744 --> 27:01.037
Not a word.

27:01.162 --> 27:02.414
I think her silence is
her answer about how she

27:02.539 --> 27:03.790
feels about me in this family.

27:03.915 --> 27:04.582
 No.

27:04.708 --> 27:05.500
No.

27:05.625 --> 27:06.626
Don't overreact.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.920
It's just a recipe for stuffing.

27:09.045 --> 27:10.964
 You said,
yourself, it's a very

27:11.089 --> 27:12.590
important family tradition.

27:12.716 --> 27:15.927
I don't think Lou thinks I'm
worthy of carrying it on.

27:21.141 --> 27:22.517
 Wow.

27:22.642 --> 27:26.813
This steak was so good,
almost as good as grandpa's.

27:26.938 --> 27:28.273
 Do you want the last bite?

27:28.398 --> 27:29.441
 No.
I'm good.

27:29.566 --> 27:30.358
Thank you.

27:30.483 --> 27:31.443
 Are you sure?

27:31.568 --> 27:32.610
The salad was pretty small.

27:32.736 --> 27:33.486
 This?

27:33.611 --> 27:35.196
No.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.781
This was great.

27:36.906 --> 27:40.618
The leaves and the pomegranates
and the tomatoes so filling.

27:40.744 --> 27:43.580
 All finished?

27:43.705 --> 27:45.540
Would you like to hear about our
dessert features this evening?

27:45.665 --> 27:46.541
 Yes.

27:46.666 --> 27:47.959
Please.

27:48.084 --> 27:49.377
 Tonight, we're offering
a white chocolate

27:49.502 --> 27:52.339
creme brulee and a tarte tatin.

27:52.464 --> 27:55.842
That's a caramelized
upside-down apple pie.

27:55.967 --> 27:56.968
 They both sound delicious.

27:57.093 --> 27:58.386
What would you recommend?

27:58.511 --> 28:00.847
 Both.

28:00.972 --> 28:01.681
 That's a great idea.

28:01.806 --> 28:03.058
We'll share.

28:03.183 --> 28:04.392
 Yeah.

28:04.517 --> 28:05.393
Great.

28:08.188 --> 28:08.813
Thanks.

28:08.938 --> 28:12.359
[music playing]

28:25.246 --> 28:27.665
 I hope I didn't miss
anything too important.

28:27.791 --> 28:28.708
 What are you doing here?

28:28.833 --> 28:29.709
 This is rodeo school, right?

28:29.834 --> 28:31.211
 Yeah.

28:31.336 --> 28:34.005
These boys are in
training so no spectator.

28:34.130 --> 28:35.340
 I'm not here to watch.

28:35.465 --> 28:36.424
I'm going to learn
how to ride a bronc.

28:36.549 --> 28:37.801
 This is rodeo school.

28:37.926 --> 28:39.719
 You don't think a
girl can ride a bronc?

28:39.844 --> 28:41.262
 I didn't say that.

28:41.388 --> 28:44.474
 It's not very progressive
of you, Mr. Fleming.

28:44.599 --> 28:45.517
 OK.

28:45.642 --> 28:48.770
[music playing]

28:49.562 --> 28:51.856
[horse neighing]

28:51.981 --> 28:53.274
 What the hell?

28:53.400 --> 28:54.275
Jade!

28:54.401 --> 28:57.278
[music playing]

29:00.699 --> 29:02.283
 Jade!

29:02.409 --> 29:03.535
Jade?

29:03.660 --> 29:06.037
 Ah.

29:06.162 --> 29:07.038
 Come on.

29:07.163 --> 29:08.039
Come on.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.751
 Ah.

29:11.876 --> 29:13.461
Beat that, boys.

29:13.586 --> 29:16.464
[music playing]

29:24.973 --> 29:25.807
 Good night.

29:25.932 --> 29:29.477
[music playing]

29:32.772 --> 29:33.648
 Wow.

29:33.773 --> 29:34.816
He wasn't lying.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.276
Those were delicious.

29:36.401 --> 29:37.652
Thank you so much for
the amazing dinner.

29:37.777 --> 29:38.820
 You're welcome.

29:41.406 --> 29:43.783
 You know, you didn't have to
take me somewhere this fancy

29:43.908 --> 29:46.119
but I'm really glad you did.

29:46.244 --> 29:50.707
 It's like I said, nothing
but the best for you.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.292
 Just going to run
to the restroom.

29:52.417 --> 29:55.253
[music playing]

29:59.215 --> 30:00.717
 No rush.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.677
And just you know,
a 20% gratuity

30:02.802 --> 30:04.304
is automatically added.

30:04.429 --> 30:05.847
But you're welcome to leave
anything over and above

30:05.972 --> 30:07.140
that if you wish.

30:07.265 --> 30:07.891
 OK.

30:08.016 --> 30:09.142
Thank you.

30:09.267 --> 30:10.143
 Of course.

30:13.938 --> 30:14.981
 What?

30:19.194 --> 30:23.698
Sorry, I just expected
it to be more expensive.

30:23.823 --> 30:25.533
Everything was so good, right?

30:25.658 --> 30:28.495
[music playing]

30:32.499 --> 30:33.375
 Hey.

30:33.500 --> 30:34.292
 Hey.

30:34.417 --> 30:35.460
 Hey.

30:35.585 --> 30:36.503
Is Georgie around?

30:36.628 --> 30:37.712
 No.

30:37.837 --> 30:39.339
She's out with Wyatt tonight.

30:39.464 --> 30:40.382
 Oh.

30:40.507 --> 30:41.841
Too bad.

30:41.966 --> 30:43.551
I need her advice about Jade.

30:43.677 --> 30:45.095
 What?

30:45.220 --> 30:47.180
Just like you wanted our
advice the other day?

30:47.305 --> 30:49.849
 Georgie knows Jade
better than anybody.

30:49.974 --> 30:51.518
 So you are going to tell her?

30:51.643 --> 30:53.061
 No.

30:53.186 --> 30:55.188
Georgie already told her.

30:55.313 --> 30:59.192
And now, Jade's angry with
me for not telling her first.

30:59.317 --> 31:01.069
 Did you not learn
anything from the fact

31:01.194 --> 31:03.113
that Georgie didn't hear
the news from you directly?

31:03.238 --> 31:04.864
And they're best friends.

31:04.989 --> 31:08.410
You must have thought she
would tell her at some point.

31:08.535 --> 31:10.412
 I thought I was
doing the right thing.

31:10.537 --> 31:13.415
[music playing]

31:29.848 --> 31:30.765
 Hey.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.100
Let's go.

31:32.225 --> 31:33.143
 You don't want an
after-dinner mint?

31:33.268 --> 31:34.728
 No.
I've got some in the car.

31:34.853 --> 31:35.645
 What?
Seriously?

31:35.770 --> 31:36.271
 Yeah.
Yeah.

31:36.396 --> 31:36.938
Come on.

31:37.063 --> 31:40.525
[music playing]

31:44.904 --> 31:45.864
 Let's go.

31:45.989 --> 31:48.950
 Hey, what's up with you?

31:49.075 --> 31:49.826
You're acting so weird.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.077
 No.

31:51.202 --> 31:52.620
It's just getting
late, you know.

31:52.746 --> 31:54.873
And I know, Jack keeps
track of that sort of thing.

31:54.998 --> 31:56.124
Watch out.

32:00.754 --> 32:02.464
 Wyatt.

32:02.589 --> 32:04.215
 Hey.

32:04.341 --> 32:06.301
Hey, come back here.

32:06.426 --> 32:07.302
You need to pay.

32:07.427 --> 32:10.305
[music playing]

32:17.729 --> 32:18.480
 Hello, Jade.

32:18.605 --> 32:19.272
 Jack.

32:19.397 --> 32:20.607
 Thanks for coming by.

32:23.276 --> 32:26.613
I understand you're
pretty upset with Tim.

32:26.738 --> 32:27.781
 Yeah.

32:27.906 --> 32:29.074
Of course, I am.

32:29.199 --> 32:31.409
 And maybe you have
good reason to be.

32:31.534 --> 32:37.624
But I want to say
something here.

32:37.749 --> 32:43.588
Tim doesn't know if this is just
some little shadow on an X-ray

32:43.713 --> 32:45.423
that's going to
go away on its own

32:45.548 --> 32:50.970
or if it's something
that could be,

32:51.096 --> 32:52.806
well, you know the scenario.

32:52.931 --> 32:54.432
 Yeah.

32:54.557 --> 32:55.558
Well, that's exactly why
he should have told me you.

32:55.684 --> 32:56.351
 Yeah.
Maybe.

32:59.437 --> 33:02.732
I had a health
scare in the past.

33:02.857 --> 33:08.530
So I know how it can affect
you and everyone around you.

33:08.655 --> 33:13.159
You feel this responsibility
to protect the people

33:13.284 --> 33:14.411
that are close to you.

33:14.536 --> 33:18.748
And sometimes,
you make mistakes.

33:18.873 --> 33:23.211
Keeping this from you,
is probably one of them.

33:23.336 --> 33:27.090
But I can tell you
this, for certain,

33:27.215 --> 33:30.260
his heart was in
the right place.

33:30.385 --> 33:35.056
He was only doing what he
thought was best for you.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.975
He cares, Jade.

33:37.100 --> 33:37.892
He cares a lot.

33:38.018 --> 33:41.146
[music playing]

33:42.522 --> 33:43.606
 Well.

33:43.732 --> 33:44.566
So what should I do?

33:47.068 --> 33:50.697
 You might start by trying
to see this through his eyes.

33:50.822 --> 33:53.241
[music playing]

33:58.204 --> 33:59.581
 I can't believe
we dined and dashed.

33:59.706 --> 34:00.790
 I know.

34:00.915 --> 34:02.375
For the millionth
time, I'm so sorry.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.627
I had no idea how expensive
it was going to be.

34:04.753 --> 34:07.005
And like I said, I
went back this morning

34:07.130 --> 34:08.505
and I paid the bill.

34:08.630 --> 34:10.675
So humiliating.

34:10.800 --> 34:13.469
 I loved the dinner and
the flowers the other day.

34:13.594 --> 34:17.056
But where did you get
all these crazy ideas

34:17.181 --> 34:18.224
that I'm into all that?

34:18.350 --> 34:19.016
 No.

34:19.141 --> 34:20.976
I know you're not.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.603
It's just, you're
my girlfriend now.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.357
And you're spending all this
time in this world with a bunch

34:25.482 --> 34:29.069
of rich people, like Dylan.

34:29.194 --> 34:31.780
 So you're trying to keep up
with a guy I don't even like?

34:31.905 --> 34:32.864
 I know.
Stupid.

34:32.989 --> 34:33.782
 Yeah.

34:33.907 --> 34:36.159
It is stupid.

34:36.284 --> 34:40.580
I like you because of the Wild
West photo shoots and the road

34:40.705 --> 34:44.125
trips to gopher museums
and going on trail

34:44.250 --> 34:47.920
rides instead of formal dances.

34:48.045 --> 34:49.547
I have so much fun with you.

34:49.672 --> 34:52.592
And I'm not in this for
the things you can buy me.

34:52.717 --> 34:55.261
Please, go back
to being yourself.

34:55.387 --> 34:56.262
OK?

34:58.056 --> 34:59.140
 OK.

35:02.352 --> 35:03.436
 So since it's
official that Lou

35:03.561 --> 35:05.105
isn't giving the recipe up--

35:05.230 --> 35:06.272
 She said that?

35:06.398 --> 35:07.273
 No.

35:07.399 --> 35:08.692
She hasn't said anything at all.

35:08.817 --> 35:09.984
 Oh.

35:10.110 --> 35:11.152
Well, she didn't
get your text then.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.405
 It says, delivered,
right beside it.

35:13.530 --> 35:15.448
So I went ahead
and I bought these.

35:15.573 --> 35:16.866
And this is how we're
doing it this year.

35:16.991 --> 35:18.034
And it's going to be great.

35:18.159 --> 35:20.453
 Just give her a call, Lisa.

35:20.578 --> 35:22.580
 I don't want it to be any
more awkward than it is.

35:22.706 --> 35:25.625
 Well, I don't see how it
can get any worse than this.

35:25.750 --> 35:30.714
You don't-- you have dreamed
up this scenario for why Lou

35:30.839 --> 35:32.507
won't give you the
recipe, and you

35:32.632 --> 35:36.302
haven't even talked to her yet.

35:36.428 --> 35:37.887
 OK.

35:38.013 --> 35:38.972
I will I'll text her again.

35:39.097 --> 35:39.931
 No.

35:40.056 --> 35:44.060
Lisa, call her.

35:44.185 --> 35:46.021
 That looks great.

35:46.146 --> 35:48.064
Just keep that forward momentum.

35:48.189 --> 35:50.316
That's the positive thing
we want to reinforce.

35:50.442 --> 35:52.652
Don't let him pay attention
to the other horses.

35:52.777 --> 35:55.488
[music playing]

35:56.823 --> 35:57.615
 Hey.

35:57.741 --> 35:58.533
 Hey.

35:58.658 --> 35:59.492
 How's it going?

35:59.617 --> 36:01.119
 Pretty good, actually.

36:01.244 --> 36:02.871
Peyton seems to have a much
better connection with him

36:02.996 --> 36:04.414
today.

36:04.539 --> 36:05.915
And he's not even reacting
to the other horses.

36:06.041 --> 36:07.667
 He feels like a
different horse.

36:07.792 --> 36:09.711
 That's because you're
a different rider.

36:09.836 --> 36:10.628
 Thanks.

36:10.754 --> 36:12.797
Hey, can we go back to my place?

36:12.922 --> 36:14.299
I want to show the
equestrian official

36:14.424 --> 36:15.967
that Tyson is a safe horse.

36:16.092 --> 36:17.052
 Do you mean today?

36:17.177 --> 36:18.428
 Yeah.

36:18.553 --> 36:20.722
Maybe he hasn't lodged
a complaint yet.

36:20.847 --> 36:22.140
 Sure.

36:22.265 --> 36:23.308
But I don't know how you're
going to get him to come

36:23.433 --> 36:25.560
out there at such short notice.

36:25.685 --> 36:27.312
 Never underestimate my mother.

36:27.437 --> 36:29.731
She can be a persuasive.

36:29.856 --> 36:32.233
[music playing]

36:38.365 --> 36:40.742
 I hope you have some top
flight broncs here today.

36:40.867 --> 36:43.578
I'm staying, so you
better have some stock

36:43.703 --> 36:45.372
that's up to my new standards.

36:50.585 --> 36:51.378
 OK.

36:51.503 --> 36:54.464
You can train with us today.

36:54.589 --> 36:56.091
But Jade, you and I
both know that you

36:56.216 --> 36:57.634
need to go back to Texas.

36:57.759 --> 36:58.927
 No.

36:59.052 --> 37:00.762
Actually, I don't think
that's what I need.

37:00.887 --> 37:03.598
The school is fine
but I like UFC more.

37:03.723 --> 37:05.767
And the competition
is just as good here.

37:05.892 --> 37:07.435
And if you want to know
the truth about that coach,

37:07.560 --> 37:10.522
he's good, but you're better.

37:10.647 --> 37:11.731
 Jade.

37:11.856 --> 37:12.565
 No.

37:12.691 --> 37:14.526
I've made up my mind.

37:14.651 --> 37:16.569
And I want to be a
part of this again.

37:16.695 --> 37:17.862
And if you really want
what's best for me,

37:17.987 --> 37:19.447
then you won't get
in the way of that.

37:25.995 --> 37:28.790
 All right then.

37:28.915 --> 37:32.335
So as luck would have it, I
have a nasty bronc right here,

37:32.460 --> 37:35.213
stubborn as a son of a gun.

37:35.338 --> 37:36.965
I think he'll be a
perfect fit for you.

37:37.090 --> 37:39.801
[music playing]

37:42.721 --> 37:43.388
 OK.

37:43.513 --> 37:45.223
What have you got?

37:45.348 --> 37:46.766
 Thank you for coming out.

37:46.891 --> 37:49.102
I know that you're going
to see a big improvement.

37:49.227 --> 37:52.063
 Well, I have to warn you,
I'm not a person easily swayed.

37:52.188 --> 37:55.483
Especially, after what I've seen
from that horse in the past.

37:55.608 --> 37:56.943
 Wait.

37:57.068 --> 37:59.320
See.

37:59.446 --> 38:01.322
He's not even reacting
to the other horses.

38:05.035 --> 38:06.286
[clunking]

38:06.411 --> 38:07.787
[horse neighing]

38:07.912 --> 38:09.247
 Peyton, circle him.

38:09.372 --> 38:10.165
You're OK.

38:10.290 --> 38:13.001
 Easy, Tyson.

38:13.126 --> 38:13.918
 Nice.

38:14.044 --> 38:14.919
 Easy boy.

38:18.381 --> 38:19.174
Did you see that?

38:19.299 --> 38:20.508
 Yeah.

38:20.633 --> 38:21.468
You were amazing.

38:21.593 --> 38:23.928
You both were.

38:24.054 --> 38:25.180
They've come a long
way, haven't they?

38:25.305 --> 38:26.181
 Yeah.

38:26.306 --> 38:27.557
They have.

38:27.682 --> 38:28.641
So what you guys do?

38:28.767 --> 38:29.809
Sedate him?

38:29.934 --> 38:30.769
 No.

38:30.894 --> 38:32.437
We didn't.

38:32.562 --> 38:34.147
Peyton has learned how
to control her fear

38:34.272 --> 38:38.526
and in doing so, Tyson
now completely trusts her.

38:38.651 --> 38:42.197
So will you reconsider?

38:42.322 --> 38:43.615
 Yeah.

38:43.740 --> 38:46.826
I'll hold off filing
a report for now,

38:46.951 --> 38:48.203
but I'm going to keep
an eye on that horse.

38:48.328 --> 38:49.162
 That's fine.

38:49.287 --> 38:50.205
We got this.

38:50.330 --> 38:53.708
[music playing]

39:00.090 --> 39:01.257
 No.

39:01.383 --> 39:02.759
I'm sorry for the
misunderstanding.

39:02.884 --> 39:04.886
I shouldn't have
jumped to conclusions.

39:05.011 --> 39:06.054
Yes.
I do.

39:06.179 --> 39:07.055
I have it all.

39:07.180 --> 39:08.181
I know.

39:08.306 --> 39:09.349
We're going to miss you too.

39:09.474 --> 39:10.850
OK.
Yep.

39:10.975 --> 39:11.393
OK.
Bye.

39:14.270 --> 39:15.814
I have it.

39:15.939 --> 39:17.482
 Have what?

39:17.607 --> 39:18.525
 That was Lou.

39:18.650 --> 39:20.151
She didn't even get my text.

39:20.276 --> 39:22.028
And she said, she certainly
would have given me

39:22.153 --> 39:24.698
the recipe right away because
I've been in the family

39:24.823 --> 39:25.990
for so long.

39:26.116 --> 39:27.492
And she thinks, I'm
great in the kitchen.

39:27.617 --> 39:28.368
She actually said that.

39:28.493 --> 39:29.369
 Nice.

39:29.494 --> 39:30.954
 Yeah.

39:31.079 --> 39:32.122
And she thinks that I am
the one that should share

39:32.247 --> 39:33.289
in the secret of the recipe.

39:33.415 --> 39:35.875
 Well, I think
that is beautiful.

39:36.001 --> 39:36.751
 Yeah.

39:36.876 --> 39:37.794
Me too.

39:37.919 --> 39:38.962
- So let's get started.
- Oh.

39:39.087 --> 39:39.879
No.

39:40.005 --> 39:40.797
No.

39:40.922 --> 39:42.757
These are for my eyes only.

39:42.882 --> 39:43.675
 What?

39:43.800 --> 39:44.426
 Yeah.

39:44.551 --> 39:45.969
It's tradition.

39:46.094 --> 39:47.095
Haven't you heard?

39:47.220 --> 39:49.931
[music playing]

39:50.932 --> 39:51.850
 Thanks for everything, Amy.

39:51.975 --> 39:52.767
Georgie was right.

39:52.892 --> 39:54.019
You're amazing.

39:54.144 --> 39:55.603
 Well, you were willing
to put in the work.

39:55.729 --> 39:57.397
That's the most important part.

39:57.522 --> 39:58.356
You got to keep it up though.

39:58.481 --> 39:59.441
 I will.

39:59.566 --> 40:00.775
 I have to say, I'm impressed.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.068
 Thanks.

40:02.193 --> 40:03.528
And thanks for being
so cool about this.

40:03.653 --> 40:04.988
I feel like I don't
really deserve it.

40:05.113 --> 40:07.073
I wasn't very welcoming
to you at first.

40:07.198 --> 40:07.907
 Don't worry about it.

40:08.033 --> 40:08.867
 No.

40:08.992 --> 40:10.493
I plan on making it up to you.

40:10.618 --> 40:12.912
And I'm going to start by
letting you in on something.

40:13.038 --> 40:14.372
My friend Laney is
the one who made

40:14.497 --> 40:15.623
that post about you and Dylan.

40:15.749 --> 40:17.792
And it was so not
cool, but I promise

40:17.917 --> 40:19.878
I'm not going to let anything
happen like that ever again.

40:20.003 --> 40:20.837
Deal?

40:20.962 --> 40:22.297
 Thanks for having my back.

40:22.422 --> 40:23.465
 That's what friends are for.

[music playing]

40:29.095 --> 40:29.971
 Hey.

40:30.096 --> 40:31.264
I got your text.

40:31.389 --> 40:32.682
What was so urgent?

40:32.807 --> 40:34.559
 I bought you something
for Thanksgiving.

40:34.684 --> 40:35.602
 I thought we
were going to stop

40:35.727 --> 40:37.729
with the expensive stuff and--

40:37.854 --> 40:38.730
 Saw it the craft store.

40:38.855 --> 40:39.647
And I couldn't resist.

40:39.773 --> 40:40.982
And it was only $1.99.

40:41.107 --> 40:42.025
Can you believe that?

40:42.150 --> 40:42.776
 I love it.

40:42.901 --> 40:45.403
This is way more you.

40:45.528 --> 40:47.822
We're having Thanksgiving
dinner tonight at Heartland.

40:47.947 --> 40:49.324
You should come.

40:49.449 --> 40:51.618
 I would love to but my
mom's doing ours tonight too.

40:51.743 --> 40:54.621
But I'll be there in spirit.

40:54.746 --> 40:56.122
It's up to you.

40:56.247 --> 40:58.750
[music playing]

41:03.588 --> 41:04.464
 Wow.

41:04.589 --> 41:05.674
This looks amazing.

41:05.799 --> 41:07.634
 Well, let's see
how it tastes first.

41:07.759 --> 41:08.343
 Ah.

41:08.468 --> 41:10.679
Wait a minute.

41:10.804 --> 41:13.139
First, we have to
go around the table,

41:13.264 --> 41:16.518
and we all say what
we're thankful for.

41:16.643 --> 41:17.477
 We do this every year.

41:17.602 --> 41:18.978
You go first.

41:19.104 --> 41:20.855
 OK.

41:20.980 --> 41:23.316
I am thankful to be home.

41:23.441 --> 41:25.360
And I'm also
thankful that I have

41:25.485 --> 41:29.364
such a great coach who will
be here for many, many rodeos

41:29.489 --> 41:31.783
to come.

41:31.908 --> 41:34.536
 Well, I am very
thankful that Lou

41:34.661 --> 41:38.707
decided to share the
secret, secret family

41:38.832 --> 41:42.168
stuffing recipe with me.

41:42.293 --> 41:45.130
And I'm also very
thankful to all of you

41:45.255 --> 41:49.175
for always accepting me
into this beautiful family.

41:49.300 --> 41:51.886
[music playing]

41:59.561 --> 42:03.231
 Well, I'm thankful that you've
all put up with my mood lately.

42:03.356 --> 42:09.029
And you've helped me start
to feel like myself again.

42:09.154 --> 42:10.655
You really don't
know what you have

42:10.780 --> 42:14.409
until you're scared
you might lose it all.

42:14.534 --> 42:17.704
[music playing]

42:19.330 --> 42:22.876
 And I'm thankful for your
first, with our little Lyndy.

42:23.001 --> 42:25.253
You're an absolute
angel, Sweetheart.

42:25.378 --> 42:27.839
[music playing]

42:29.424 --> 42:32.969
 I'm thankful for some new
relationships in my life.

42:33.094 --> 42:36.598
But I'm even more thankful for
the relationships I have here.

42:36.723 --> 42:39.601
[music playing]

42:44.522 --> 42:46.107
 I suspect, you
all know what I'm

42:46.232 --> 42:50.111
going to say since I say the
same thing every single year.

42:50.236 --> 42:53.198
But it hasn't changed.

42:53.323 --> 42:58.953
The thing I'm most thankful
for is this family.
