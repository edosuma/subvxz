WEBVTT

00:06.257 --> 00:08.884
Sorry, did I wake you?

00:08.884 --> 00:09.969
Yes.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.596
The baby's pressing on my bladder,

00:12.596 --> 00:15.850
so I have to pee
approximately 78 times every night.

00:16.308 --> 00:20.438
We can talk about baby names
since we are both awake.

00:22.565 --> 00:25.818
I keep coming back to one name... Kelly.

00:26.569 --> 00:28.863
It reminds me of a Kelly clamp.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.948
And I will think
about grasping onto tissue

00:30.948 --> 00:33.534
or vessels every time I'm holding our son.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.162
What about Addison?

00:36.579 --> 00:38.497
Addison Murphy.

00:38.497 --> 00:41.375
Addison is the name of a disease.

00:42.418 --> 00:45.755
I'll worry our son is not producing
enough cortisol or aldosterone.

00:47.381 --> 00:51.969
You can go back to sleep,
I have to go pee again anyway.

01:02.521 --> 01:05.483
Good morning. Pancakes, anyone?

01:06.066 --> 01:08.277
They are not just ordinary pancakes.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.488
They are Dutch baby pancakes,

01:10.488 --> 01:13.783
also known as Bismarcks, Dutch puffs,
and even Hootenannies.

01:13.783 --> 01:15.993
- I looked it up.
- That is correct.

01:15.993 --> 01:18.788
They're baked in the oven not fried.
I was up early.

01:18.954 --> 01:21.874
Sorry if my frequent bathroom trips
kept you up.

01:21.874 --> 01:24.210
Don't be silly. You're making a human.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.253
Thank you.

01:26.629 --> 01:30.341
So, Kelly and Addison are out,
I don't disagree.

01:30.466 --> 01:32.343
How about Munchausen?

01:32.885 --> 01:34.762
- Shaun...
- Or Parkinson?

01:36.013 --> 01:38.265
Our bedroom conversations are private.

01:39.350 --> 01:40.392
All of them?

01:40.976 --> 01:43.187
It's not like we were talking about--

01:44.605 --> 01:45.773
Never mind.

01:46.482 --> 01:47.525
Let's eat.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.488
A friend on the San Jose schoolboard
reached out,

01:52.488 --> 01:56.367
they're looking for someone
to give a series of online talks

01:56.367 --> 01:58.702
to high schoolers
about careers in medicine.

01:58.911 --> 02:01.121
Specifically to young women of color.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.290
- That's great.
- I thought you'd be perfect.

02:03.874 --> 02:04.875
Oh.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.379
That wasn't the reaction I was expecting.

02:08.379 --> 02:10.506
Maybe Dr. Tooks can do it?

02:10.881 --> 02:12.258
Tooks is a mom,

02:12.258 --> 02:14.844
these high schoolkids
don't see themselves in her.

02:14.969 --> 02:18.055
- There's gotta be someone else.
- There isn't.

02:18.055 --> 02:20.641
Only 2% of surgeons in the U.S. are black.

02:20.808 --> 02:23.310
Don't be afraid
to step into the spotlight.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.313
I'm not afraid, I'm just very busy.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.358
Okay. It'll only take a couple hours
of your time.

02:30.234 --> 02:32.862
"If you can see it,
you can be it" is a real thing...

02:34.280 --> 02:37.199
It's not my responsibility
to be the one they see.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.452
Okay.

02:48.961 --> 02:51.213
Nathan hit his head
on the trampoline frame

02:51.213 --> 02:52.715
at his birthday party.

02:52.882 --> 02:54.884
He got a bump, but he seemed fine...

02:56.260 --> 02:57.344
Where's daddy?

02:58.387 --> 03:02.349
I told you, he's at work helping people.
He'll be back in a few days, okay.

03:02.349 --> 03:05.060
Is it possible to develop a concussion
two days later?

03:05.603 --> 03:07.938
Let's see if we can find out
what's going on.

03:13.152 --> 03:14.820
Nathan, what's your puppy's name?

03:15.571 --> 03:16.572
Patches.

03:16.572 --> 03:20.326
Can I look into Patches' eyes
with this light? Make sure he's okay?

03:21.118 --> 03:22.995
Or you can do it?

03:23.495 --> 03:24.622
Just look in here.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.917
Can you pick this up
and give it to the doctor?

03:29.293 --> 03:31.462
I can't. Where's daddy?

03:36.675 --> 03:38.385
Can you give me a high five, bud.

03:39.094 --> 03:41.305
Good. Now high ten.

03:46.018 --> 03:48.604
What is happening? Is this a concussion?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.105
It's not a concussion.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.107
Your son is having a stroke.

04:10.668 --> 04:13.212
- You are late.
- No, I'm not.

04:14.463 --> 04:15.923
It's 8:01 am.

04:16.382 --> 04:18.133
It-- It is now.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.553
But I'm sure it was still 8:00
when I walked through the door.

04:21.553 --> 04:23.263
Were you getting your hair cut?

04:24.223 --> 04:25.182
No.

04:25.683 --> 04:27.226
Are you using drugs again?

04:28.811 --> 04:29.853
No.

04:30.437 --> 04:35.442
You are on probation
and I am responsible for you.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.070
Common signs include
ignoring responsibilities

04:38.070 --> 04:39.947
and secretive behavior.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.407
I promise, I'm clean.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.534
I'll pee in a cup if you want.

04:43.534 --> 04:44.785
Okay.

04:45.703 --> 04:47.413
I'm going to assist Dr. Park.

04:47.413 --> 04:50.165
You can join the case
if your sample comes back clean.

04:52.001 --> 04:53.252
I wasn't even late.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.965
A chance to help young diverse women

04:57.965 --> 05:00.884
and kiss the hospital president's ass
at the same time?

05:01.218 --> 05:02.803
There's only one answer to that

05:02.803 --> 05:05.180
and it starts with a "y"
and ends with a "yes."

05:05.889 --> 05:08.934
- That didn't work.
- I know. But I stand by my point.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.310
Aren't we busy enough?

05:10.728 --> 05:13.939
Why do I have extra homework
because I have more melanin?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.483
And why is my Grandma E texting me?

05:16.483 --> 05:18.402
You shouldn't think of it as homework

05:18.402 --> 05:20.904
and you shouldn't think of it as a burden.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.657
You shouldn't think you know
what it's like to be me.

05:24.616 --> 05:25.784
Point taken.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.287
What the...?

05:28.537 --> 05:31.040
Okay, can we just focus
on our patients, please?

05:35.794 --> 05:38.255
Quinque, there you are.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.591
Grandma E? What are you doing here?

05:40.841 --> 05:43.427
I was told they have doctors here.

05:43.427 --> 05:48.599
I've got tightness in my chest,
shortness of breath, swollen ankles--

05:48.599 --> 05:50.601
Didn't you see your doctors in Oakland?

05:50.601 --> 05:56.482
Those idiots said my ascites
indicated "cirrhosis of the liver"

05:56.482 --> 05:58.233
like I'm some kind of drunk.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.737
I figured with my family connections,

06:01.737 --> 06:04.198
I could get top- shelf care here.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.408
I can't be involved in any of your--

06:06.408 --> 06:07.743
But I can.

06:07.743 --> 06:11.872
Delighted to meet you Grandma E,
I'm Dr. Wolke.

06:11.872 --> 06:16.794
Okay, Jordan baby, you stay
and keep an eye on little mister here.

06:16.794 --> 06:19.713
He might try to skate by
on his good looks.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.717
Can you lean back for me?

06:26.261 --> 06:29.473
Jordan, you never mentioned
having a sister.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.558
See, I like him.

06:32.768 --> 06:35.479
Distended jugular veins
with increased JVP.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.607
Kussmaul's sign and Pulsus paradoxus.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.568
Maybe I don't like you so much now.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.654
She does have a history
of chest radiation.

06:49.201 --> 06:52.121
- Echo-brightness of the pericardium.
- What does that mean?

06:52.121 --> 06:56.083
The sac around your heart is inflamed
and there are calcium deposits.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.377
Grandma?

07:00.796 --> 07:03.674
- Faint pulses.
- Let's do something before she arrest.

07:03.674 --> 07:05.843
Set up an O.R. STAT for a pericardiotomy.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.515
No, Rick, stay. I promise I've got this.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.226
Sorry to interrupt. We're ready.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.022
Can you please talk to my husband?

07:19.606 --> 07:20.691
Of course.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.526
This is Doctor Park.

07:22.526 --> 07:25.529
How does a four year old end up
with a stroke?

07:25.529 --> 07:27.614
Head trauma is one of the main causes.

07:27.614 --> 07:31.618
I feel like I should get on a plane now,
but Linda's telling me to stay.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.370
- How far are you?
- Alabama.

07:33.370 --> 07:36.498
We still have people missing
after the tornado ripped through.

07:36.999 --> 07:39.084
I can't tell you how to prioritize.

07:39.084 --> 07:42.337
<i>I'm hoping to make your son better
well before you could get here.</i>

07:42.838 --> 07:43.839
Thank you.

07:46.842 --> 07:47.968
We're okay.

07:48.260 --> 07:52.181
And you'll be back in a few days anyway.
Just stay and keep helping.

07:53.515 --> 07:55.434
Okay.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.649
Evacuating the hematoma.

08:03.192 --> 08:05.110
I saw on the Weather Channel

08:05.110 --> 08:08.405
that the Alabama tornado was the 15th
to reach a four

08:08.405 --> 08:11.033
on the Enhanced Fujita scale
in the last three years.

08:11.033 --> 08:14.620
Together they have caused 116 fatalities.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.956
Luckily we have people like his Dad
who run towards a crisis.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.543
But he also has a crisis right here
with his son.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.670
He didn't know that when he left.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.840
I'm not seeing an active bleeder.

08:27.341 --> 08:34.056
There is a hyper-vascularized
brain parenchyma in this resection cavity.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.226
The major named vessels
are all smaller than usual,

08:37.434 --> 08:38.852
and look scarred in.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.149
The hemorrhage
was not from hitting his head.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.071
This boy and his brain
are even sicker than we thought.

08:51.156 --> 08:52.991
Lighting the sternal retractor.

08:54.826 --> 08:58.288
So why does she call you Queen K?

08:58.288 --> 08:59.790
<i>It's</i> Quinque.

08:59.790 --> 09:02.876
<i>Latin for five
because I'm the fifth child of six.</i>

09:03.085 --> 09:05.003
Does she call your little brother Sex?

09:05.003 --> 09:07.297
<i>Please focus
so you don't kill my grandmother.</i>

09:07.297 --> 09:10.133
Cauterizing the edges
of the sternal periosteum.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.387
She's so charming.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.931
Why didn't you get any of those genes?

09:16.390 --> 09:20.102
<i>Charm is one of many layers
of a very complicated woman.</i>

09:20.102 --> 09:23.563
Grandma E drove me like a drill sergeant
from the day I was born.

09:23.855 --> 09:27.985
Ensure the pericardium is free
from both the pleurae and the diaphragm.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.196
15 blade.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.453
I need a new 15 blade...

09:40.122 --> 09:41.206
<i>What's happening?</i>

09:43.917 --> 09:47.963
I can't pierce it. Never seen
constrictive pericarditis this severe.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.051
It's completely calcified.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.054
Your grandma has
what's known as coconut heart.

10:03.228 --> 10:07.316
Your son has a rare auto-immune disorder
called Primary CNS vasculitis.

10:07.316 --> 10:10.777
It's causing inflammation
of his blood vessels throughout his brain.

10:11.903 --> 10:15.866
Okay. What are the next steps?

10:16.366 --> 10:18.076
Cyclophosphamide infusions.

10:18.702 --> 10:19.911
That's chemo.

10:20.996 --> 10:23.332
My mother had that
when she had breast cancer

10:23.332 --> 10:26.585
and she lost her hair, threw up,
got sores all over her mouth.

10:26.585 --> 10:29.087
Letting this go untreated is far worse.

10:29.087 --> 10:32.549
Recurrent brain bleeds,
possibly large territory strokes.

10:32.549 --> 10:33.675
They could be fatal.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.887
Nathan will be
on some form of immunosuppression

10:36.887 --> 10:38.138
his whole life.

10:42.351 --> 10:43.268
I'm sorry.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.479
Thank you, Doctor.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.824
How do you crack a coconut
without puncturing what's underneath?

10:57.824 --> 11:00.035
Constrictive pericarditis.

11:00.702 --> 11:04.039
Please stop saying coconut.
It's my grandmother and it's serious.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.540
Not your case.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.877
I'm just having a snack
and trying to help--

11:12.381 --> 11:13.590
We need ideas.

11:13.715 --> 11:17.636
Left anterior thoracotomy
and partial excision of the pericardium.

11:17.636 --> 11:20.639
Avoid sternal infection
and seems likely the safest route.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.516
It'll require more surgeries.

11:22.516 --> 11:23.767
Please go away.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.061
Wait, what are you advocating for?

11:26.645 --> 11:27.687
Complete removal.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.439
A median sternotomy gives us

11:29.439 --> 11:33.443
clear access to the diseased pericardium
from phrenic nerve to phrenic nerve.

11:33.443 --> 11:34.736
It's way too risky.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.905
Complete decortication fixes her heart.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.448
Completely.

11:40.492 --> 11:43.203
You're advocating for an extensive,
high-risk surgery.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.288
Meanwhile, partial removal

11:45.288 --> 11:47.999
offers your 70-year-oldgrandmother
a shot at full health

11:48.125 --> 11:50.335
for what likely amount
to the rest of her life.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.546
Shouldn't you let the patient decide?

11:52.546 --> 11:55.715
No. I don't present something
if it's not a viable option.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.175
I think it is viable.

11:57.175 --> 11:58.510
Her surgeon doesn't.

11:59.428 --> 12:01.304
Jordan, go be a granddaughter.

12:07.853 --> 12:11.565
If I hadn't become a surgeon,
I think I would've been a writer.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.484
You never told me
your grandmother worked at Marcus Books.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.194
Was I supposed to?

12:16.194 --> 12:18.655
I was just a lowly clerk.

12:18.864 --> 12:21.950
It came up
when I heard his name was Marcus.

12:22.325 --> 12:23.869
There is nothing lowly

12:23.869 --> 12:26.830
about being at the center
of a cultural landmark.

12:27.247 --> 12:30.083
My Auntie Winn
used to take me to author readings

12:30.083 --> 12:32.502
by Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou...

12:32.627 --> 12:34.296
and you were there everyday.

12:34.296 --> 12:37.007
I probably served you some cookies.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.217
- Did you ever meet, James Baldwin?
- I did.

12:39.217 --> 12:42.304
Okay. She can probably use some rest.

12:42.679 --> 12:44.306
Yes, absolutely.

12:46.516 --> 12:50.729
If you need anything at all,
Ms. Evelyn, you know where to find me.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.482
- Thank you, Marcus.
- Yes, ma'am.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.903
Marcus Books. Wow!

12:59.613 --> 13:00.822
That was weird.

13:00.822 --> 13:05.785
Not as weird as you refusing
to do his mentorship program?

13:08.663 --> 13:10.999
Let's talk about you...

13:12.918 --> 13:14.169
and your heart.

13:15.212 --> 13:19.382
Your pericardium has become hardened,
likely from your cancer treatments.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.053
So what happens now?

13:23.470 --> 13:26.181
Dr. Lim has decided on a partial removal.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.642
And you think that's best?

13:33.146 --> 13:37.192
Jordan Jacqueline Allen, you look at me
and you tell me,

13:38.193 --> 13:39.903
if you think it's best.

13:50.956 --> 13:53.166
Wow, it took you guys a while to get home?

13:53.875 --> 13:57.128
We went out to dinner.
Because Lea thought that--

13:57.128 --> 14:00.090
Why are you on the floor?
What's with the high chairs?

14:00.090 --> 14:02.300
I stopped at Costco on the way home.

14:02.300 --> 14:05.637
Surprisingly diverse selection of wines.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.973
There's an open bottle if you guys want--

14:07.973 --> 14:10.016
Although that might be empty.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.102
Danger!

14:12.102 --> 14:15.063
I remember wine. Are you drunk?

14:15.230 --> 14:17.107
No. Maybe a little.

14:17.107 --> 14:19.317
I'm baby-proofing. Danger!

14:19.526 --> 14:20.819
Are you okay?

14:20.819 --> 14:23.613
Oh, you guys got to get down here
and check this out.

14:23.613 --> 14:27.284
From the baby's perspective,
this place is a fricking death trap...

14:27.284 --> 14:29.578
for Nicholas. Place holder name.

14:29.578 --> 14:31.246
We can call him Nick, Nicky.

14:31.246 --> 14:32.539
I like Nicky.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.916
Why did you buy three high chairs?

14:34.916 --> 14:38.420
One's a gift for you,
and the other two I'll take back. Danger!

14:38.420 --> 14:39.921
That could be dangerous.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.048
You don't have to buy us anything.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.758
I also got you a nanny cam.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.848
It's-- It's-- It's a teddy bear,

14:49.848 --> 14:52.517
but you wouldn't believe
there is a camera inside.

14:52.851 --> 14:56.354
That is very practical... and cute.

14:57.105 --> 15:01.651
Okay. We will not need a highchair
or baby proofing for a year.

15:01.651 --> 15:04.529
And we'll not name our son
Nick, Nicholas or Nicky,

15:04.529 --> 15:06.448
or any variation thereof.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.366
Okay.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.911
That's fair enough
but you're going to want this,

15:11.911 --> 15:15.373
it's a book by Dr. Spock on parenting.

15:15.498 --> 15:17.792
Everyone read this book back in the day,

15:17.792 --> 15:20.003
he was so popular, he ran for president.

15:20.003 --> 15:21.087
Danger.

15:21.630 --> 15:22.714
I'm going to bed.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.135
Yeah, but--
You're going to want to read this

15:27.135 --> 15:29.512
before the baby comes
and you get exhausted.

15:29.512 --> 15:30.597
Already there.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.564
Danger!

15:43.443 --> 15:44.569
What were you thinking?

15:45.487 --> 15:47.530
My grandmother deserved the good muffins?

15:47.530 --> 15:49.824
She'll only agree
to complete decortication,

15:49.824 --> 15:51.618
which she shouldn't know about.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.204
You do not present a patient
with an option

15:54.204 --> 15:56.790
that I've deemed unsafe
and wouldn't even perform.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.458
- It's unacceptable.
- You're right.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.711
I felt like your plan
was a little conservative--

16:01.711 --> 16:03.129
You are a resident,

16:03.838 --> 16:07.300
your feelings about my decisions
are not relevant.

16:08.551 --> 16:11.388
- I'll tell her I was wrong.
- And convince her I'm right.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.056
Or find her another hospital.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.018
Yes, ma'am.

16:20.105 --> 16:21.523
Your muffins are ready.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.246
How's he handling the chemo?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.331
You doing okay, bud?

16:40.959 --> 16:44.254
Nathan, can you answer Doctor Park,
please? Is everything okay?

16:44.713 --> 16:45.672
No.

16:50.719 --> 16:52.387
You're right. It's not okay.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.931
Okay, those aren't toys.

16:56.599 --> 16:57.851
We okay, mom?

16:58.476 --> 17:00.812
He's got dozens of new toys
for his birthday...

17:00.812 --> 17:03.690
he shouldn't have to be building castles
with pill bottles.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.401
I'm sorry.

17:07.652 --> 17:10.113
You shouldn't be trying
to do all of this alone.

17:10.947 --> 17:14.617
My husband is saving lives.
I can't pull him away from that.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.870
I can.

17:18.455 --> 17:19.664
Give me your phone.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.636
Hi Rick, Doctor Park.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.435
You okay?

17:42.020 --> 17:43.354
Yeah. I'm fine.

17:47.358 --> 17:48.568
But you are not.

17:49.736 --> 17:50.945
What happened?

17:51.780 --> 17:54.991
I was wrong
to question Dr. Lim's surgical advice.

17:56.618 --> 17:57.827
She is the best.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.996
I hope to be her someday.

18:00.747 --> 18:04.125
And if she thinks the partial removal
of the pericardium

18:04.125 --> 18:07.086
is the best course of action,
then I agree with her.

18:08.463 --> 18:09.589
Okay.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.176
Then that's what I'll do.

18:14.969 --> 18:19.974
But why did you go against her advice
in the first place?

18:23.061 --> 18:26.189
I felt like I needed to do extra.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.024
To be a hero.

18:28.858 --> 18:29.859
Why?

18:30.610 --> 18:34.030
Since I was little,
you told me I had to work twice as hard,

18:34.030 --> 18:36.366
be twice as good as everybody else.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.079
After all these years,

18:41.079 --> 18:45.583
I'm still striving to be good enough
for you.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.379
Now see that's a lot of pressure.

18:50.839 --> 18:57.512
But it's what the world requires
from people that look like you and me.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.394
When is my daddy coming?

19:04.394 --> 19:07.564
Your daddy is getting on a plane,
he's gonna be back soon.

19:07.564 --> 19:10.650
But now, we have to see
if the medicine is working, okay?

19:10.650 --> 19:13.945
If it is, can I stop taking it?

19:14.654 --> 19:17.615
I'm so sorry. You still need it.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.077
I hate it.

19:23.705 --> 19:24.747
I know.

19:27.834 --> 19:31.421
Let's play a game,
like hide and seek, okay?

19:32.672 --> 19:33.923
Here, lie down.

19:34.799 --> 19:37.594
You get to go in the tunnel.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.598
And stay very still
so nobody can find you...

19:41.848 --> 19:45.018
I'll come back and get you
when the coast is clear. Sound good?

19:54.110 --> 19:55.612
You are very good with him.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.822
Starting the imaging.

19:57.822 --> 19:58.948
Thanks.

20:00.533 --> 20:04.245
<i>Nathan, you're about to hear some banging.
It's just the machine</i>

20:04.245 --> 20:06.748
<i>but remember to stay really still, okay?</i>

20:06.873 --> 20:07.957
I am.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.545
<i>Try a little harder, okay, bud?</i>

20:16.090 --> 20:19.344
Motion artifact,
we might have to sedate him.

20:19.344 --> 20:21.304
Those are not artifacts.

20:22.639 --> 20:27.352
He does not have CNS Vasculitis,
he has Moyamoya disease.

20:30.939 --> 20:32.315
<i>What the heck is that?</i>

20:32.315 --> 20:35.526
A narrow carotid artery
is reducing blood flow to his brain.

20:36.361 --> 20:39.113
This area here,
looks like a puff of smoke?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.866
That's what <i>moyamoya</i> means in Japanese,

20:42.367 --> 20:44.661
A bunch of new,
tiny vessels have developed

20:44.661 --> 20:46.454
to circumvent the blockage,

20:46.454 --> 20:50.750
but because the vessels are abnormal,
they're prone to bleeds.

20:51.459 --> 20:55.713
We can fix the problem
with a very interesting brain surgery.

20:55.838 --> 20:59.801
<i>So now that you're done poisoning our son
with chemo that he didn't need,</i>

21:00.134 --> 21:02.428
<i>we should trust you
to crack open his skull?</i>

21:02.428 --> 21:05.890
We will use a small craniotomy to access--

21:05.890 --> 21:07.976
I get why you're frustrated.

21:08.810 --> 21:12.438
Moyamoya is rare
and notoriously hard to diagnose.

21:12.647 --> 21:15.733
Many kids get chemo they don't need
for a lot longer.

21:17.735 --> 21:20.405
We're hoping to do
Nathan's first brain surgery tomorrow.

21:23.408 --> 21:24.617
He needs more than one?

21:25.243 --> 21:26.619
What's brain surgery?

21:28.913 --> 21:29.872
Hey.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.752
It's how we're going
to make you all better.

21:34.752 --> 21:36.212
No more chemo?

21:36.379 --> 21:37.547
No more chemo.

21:37.547 --> 21:39.215
Are you going to be here?

21:40.008 --> 21:41.801
<i>My plane got cancelled, buddy,</i>

21:42.427 --> 21:46.222
<i>but look, I promise I'm going to be there
as soon as I can, okay?</i>

21:47.098 --> 21:49.350
Can Patches get brain surgery, too?

21:50.518 --> 21:55.606
No. Patches is a stuffed animal,
it does not have a brain.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.828
I just peed in our bathtub.

22:53.998 --> 22:55.458
Glassman has to go.

23:08.721 --> 23:10.556
- Hey!
- Sorry!

23:47.176 --> 23:48.594
First years.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.019
You are late again.

23:57.019 --> 23:59.480
C'mon. Like one minute.

23:59.480 --> 24:00.648
Last time...

24:00.648 --> 24:03.484
Your drug test from yesterday
was negative,

24:03.484 --> 24:07.613
you are not using.
So what is causing your tardiness?

24:09.949 --> 24:11.242
Look, I'm sorry.

24:12.034 --> 24:13.452
I've been doing really well.

24:14.203 --> 24:16.164
And the reason I'm doing so well

24:16.539 --> 24:17.832
is my daily meeting.

24:18.499 --> 24:22.879
Sets my mind right. It's kinda far.
And there's morning traffic.

24:25.256 --> 24:28.092
Support is very important.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.555
And so is punctuality.

24:33.264 --> 24:36.809
I'm going to map a complex
double-barrel vascular bypass.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.946
- Dang it.
- That's the 6th time you've killed her.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.824
It wasn't working with the rongeur,
need little more power.

24:51.824 --> 24:54.243
- And the right torque.
- That's reassuring.

24:54.911 --> 24:57.538
Stop hovering and go visit, visitor.

24:58.789 --> 25:01.250
Convincing Evelyn Allen to do a surgery,

25:01.250 --> 25:04.253
after convincing her not to,
was a little bumpy.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.173
Details, please.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.800
I took the opportunity to explain

25:09.800 --> 25:11.969
how much pressure she's put on me,

25:11.969 --> 25:15.473
and she took that opportunity
to make me feel inadequate once again.

25:16.140 --> 25:19.393
I've never thought of you as someone
who lacks for confidence.

25:20.478 --> 25:21.938
Fake it till you make it.

25:23.022 --> 25:26.442
You're a resident
in one of the top surgical programs.

25:26.442 --> 25:27.902
You've already made it.

25:29.654 --> 25:32.156
All I see is the ground
I've still got to cover.

25:40.456 --> 25:41.916
How's it going?

25:42.500 --> 25:44.252
Not ready for primetime.

25:52.760 --> 25:58.557
This S.T.A. anatomy is ideal
as a donor vessel to bypass the blockage.

25:58.557 --> 26:01.602
So we'll reroute the scalp vessel
into the brain here.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.732
Gonna give you a little tip.
Next time a child asks

26:06.732 --> 26:08.943
if you could do surgery
on his stuffed animal

26:08.943 --> 26:11.821
so that he feels less scared? Say yes.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.907
I was only telling him the truth.

26:17.702 --> 26:21.914
This branch of the middle cerebral artery
looks like an ideal recipient.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.875
You're about to be a father.
Children are illogical.

26:26.168 --> 26:28.546
We can place temporary clips
for vascular control,

26:28.546 --> 26:32.300
and then anastomose the STA to the MCA
using 10-0 prolenes.

26:34.427 --> 26:37.305
I was very logical as a child.

26:37.722 --> 26:41.517
I did not like being talked to
like I was dumb

26:41.517 --> 26:44.353
and I definitely did not like
being lied to.

26:44.353 --> 26:46.522
That child there felt
that if his Dalmatian

26:46.522 --> 26:48.607
went through this scary thing with him,

26:48.607 --> 26:50.067
he would be less scared.

26:53.154 --> 26:56.240
If you can embrace
another person's thought process,

26:56.449 --> 26:58.242
it can strengthen the relationship.

27:00.995 --> 27:05.166
Lea thinks
she should not have to pee in the tub,

27:05.541 --> 27:07.126
which I understand.

27:17.053 --> 27:19.430
No kidnapping my grandmother.

27:20.556 --> 27:25.811
I asked him to do a lap around the floor,
I needed a change of scenery.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.439
Well, you had your lap,
now back to your cell.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.566
Thanks for the tour, Speedy.

27:31.359 --> 27:32.693
Speedy?

27:32.985 --> 27:35.821
I was sprinting through here this morning.

27:36.447 --> 27:37.698
I was late.

27:37.865 --> 27:38.991
Second time this week.

27:38.991 --> 27:42.620
Snooze buttons are the devil's plaything.

27:43.079 --> 27:46.123
I was actually at a Narcotics Anonymous
meeting this morning.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.500
I go every day.

27:47.500 --> 27:50.920
"Confess your sins to each other
and pray for each other

27:50.920 --> 27:53.047
so that you may be healed."

27:53.756 --> 27:55.591
James 5:15-16.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.301
Amen to that.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.220
Good for you, young man.

28:04.141 --> 28:07.353
- There's got to be a closer meeting.
- I've tried the closer one...

28:07.353 --> 28:08.979
The hardliners who run it think

28:08.979 --> 28:12.274
that wearing a suit and tie
is key to staying sober.

28:12.274 --> 28:15.945
Start your own meeting,
here at the hospital.

28:16.946 --> 28:20.950
Set your own tone,
and you're never late for work again.

28:21.992 --> 28:25.329
No, I'm not qualified to be a leader.

28:25.329 --> 28:27.123
No such thing.

28:27.706 --> 28:31.085
Leaders lead, simple as that.

28:39.009 --> 28:40.553
You are annoying.

28:41.095 --> 28:42.847
Well, nice to see you too, Shaun.

28:42.847 --> 28:44.849
Not to me, but to Lea,

28:44.849 --> 28:47.268
and I want
to keep our relationship strong.

28:47.268 --> 28:50.438
She feels your presence has taken over
our apartment

28:50.438 --> 28:52.064
and she wants her space back.

28:52.064 --> 28:54.483
I overstepped with the babyproofing.

28:54.483 --> 28:57.528
- And suggesting names.
- And the Dr. Spock thing.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.238
And there's more, the nanny cam.

28:59.238 --> 29:00.739
Okay, okay. Okay.

29:03.659 --> 29:09.832
It's was fun, thinking about your baby,
and the future.

29:10.541 --> 29:13.502
Maybe it has been a nice distraction.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.005
Yes, it was.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.466
Which you've needed
since your house burned down

29:18.466 --> 29:21.302
and you have no place to live.

29:21.302 --> 29:22.970
Yes, thank you, Shaun.

29:23.596 --> 29:28.809
Dr. Glassman,
you are not exactly my family.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.603
I get it. I know, Shaun.

29:30.853 --> 29:33.314
But I consider you
to be the baby's grandfather.

29:44.241 --> 29:45.409
Wow.

29:48.204 --> 29:49.330
Thank you.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.875
I never thought that would happen for me.

29:55.503 --> 29:56.712
Thank you.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.765
You can stay. I will tell Lea
and she will change her mind.

30:07.765 --> 30:10.017
No, no, no. I'm going to go.

30:10.267 --> 30:11.727
Where?

30:14.396 --> 30:15.731
I don't know.

30:18.442 --> 30:19.985
Can I get you a magazine?

30:19.985 --> 30:21.737
No, thank you.

30:23.197 --> 30:25.074
Are your pillows positioned okay?

30:25.407 --> 30:27.535
Okay, you're doing it again.

30:28.244 --> 30:29.370
What?

30:29.370 --> 30:31.664
The thing you've doing
since you were little...

30:31.664 --> 30:33.332
just fussing over people...

30:34.708 --> 30:37.795
when it's you that's in need.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.091
Okay, c'mon. Tell me.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.972
You just met Dr. Perez,

30:48.889 --> 30:51.225
and you were so nice and supportive.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.730
Do you know how long
I've waited for you to say

30:56.730 --> 31:00.943
"Good job" to me.
Or "Wow, you're a doctor."

31:04.363 --> 31:06.865
Do you know who Rebecca Crumpler is?

31:08.492 --> 31:09.577
No.

31:09.577 --> 31:12.913
She was the first black female doctor.

31:13.205 --> 31:17.543
And when I read about her,
I wanted to be just like her.

31:17.543 --> 31:21.547
But unfortunately,
I didn't know who she was either

31:22.214 --> 31:25.301
until you were in med school.

31:28.304 --> 31:34.018
Quinque... I've been impressed by you

31:34.727 --> 31:38.355
since you were in kindergarten.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.067
Grandma.

31:43.277 --> 31:44.528
Grandma.

31:46.655 --> 31:49.325
- What's going on?
- She's having trouble breathing.

31:50.284 --> 31:51.577
She's hypotensive.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.875
Jugular vein distension is increased,
her heart is failing.

31:59.043 --> 32:00.919
Tell me you got through a practice run.

32:00.919 --> 32:04.548
We were postponing the surgery
so we could practice more.

32:15.309 --> 32:16.602
What are you hanging?

32:18.145 --> 32:19.438
It's a...

32:21.106 --> 32:22.816
You can read obviously.

32:24.068 --> 32:27.446
Is this okay? I'm sorry,
I should have cleared it with you first.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.739
Yes, you should have.

32:30.032 --> 32:33.577
Because I'd have told you to use
the small conference room up on six.

32:33.702 --> 32:36.038
It's quieter up there,
and the room has blinds,

32:36.830 --> 32:38.624
to help with the "anonymous" part.

32:39.875 --> 32:40.918
Thanks.

32:52.513 --> 32:53.681
This is Park.

32:53.681 --> 32:57.518
I had to fly to San Francisco,
I'm just grabbing a cab now.

32:57.518 --> 33:00.521
Can you hold the surgery
until I get there?

33:00.521 --> 33:03.440
We can't. If he hemorrhages again...

33:03.816 --> 33:05.818
<i>Or, can you put him on the phone?</i>

33:06.026 --> 33:07.611
He's already sedated.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.823
But what if this was my last chance

33:10.823 --> 33:12.074
to talk to him?

33:15.160 --> 33:17.162
I'll treat Nathan like my own son.

33:17.663 --> 33:18.872
I promise.

33:21.500 --> 33:22.626
Thank you.

33:28.716 --> 33:30.217
Try to puncture the pericardium

33:30.217 --> 33:32.928
and grab an edge
so we can start to peel the shell.

33:33.554 --> 33:35.097
Apply more pressure.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.892
We may need another tool to pierce it.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.144
Let's try the rongeur.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.859
Perforation of the myocardium.

33:46.859 --> 33:49.778
Manually tamponading the hole.
Pledgeted sutures.

33:51.613 --> 33:53.824
The pericardium's just too calcified.

33:53.824 --> 33:55.534
It's adhering to the myocardium.

33:55.534 --> 33:56.952
So what do we do?

33:56.952 --> 33:59.788
Repair the perforation, after that,
I'm open to ideas.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.124
We could put her on bypass.

34:02.124 --> 34:06.462
Gently peel off the calcified pericardium
bit by bit,

34:06.754 --> 34:09.965
- and repair damage as we go.
- Poking holes in a bucket

34:09.965 --> 34:12.885
and hoping we can plug them before
the water leaks out.

34:12.885 --> 34:14.261
<i>I have an idea.</i>

34:14.887 --> 34:17.514
- Go ahead.
<i>- It's called the Waffle procedure.</i>

34:18.474 --> 34:20.058
<i>I found a novel study, it said</i>

34:20.058 --> 34:24.021
<i>dense calcified plaques can be scored
into multiple cross hatched sections.</i>

34:24.021 --> 34:25.481
No removal at all?

34:25.481 --> 34:27.441
<i>Exactly. The shell stays in place,</i>

34:27.441 --> 34:30.694
<i>but the heart has room to expand
and contract as it beats.</i>

34:31.945 --> 34:33.071
Mortality rate?

34:33.071 --> 34:34.490
<i>Under 8%</i>

34:38.494 --> 34:39.745
Talk me through it.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.580
<i>Okay. Ultrasonic scalpel.</i>

34:43.207 --> 34:46.293
Start by incising
the calcified pericardium.

34:51.465 --> 34:53.467
ICG angio looks great.

34:53.759 --> 34:56.762
Doctor Perez,
you may do the dural closure,

34:56.762 --> 34:58.514
then replace the skull flap.

35:02.935 --> 35:04.102
Before we close...

35:06.438 --> 35:09.608
We're ahead of schedule.
Why not go ahead with the bypass

35:09.608 --> 35:12.694
- in his other hemisphere?
- That is not the plan.

35:12.694 --> 35:15.864
Simultaneous bi-lateral surgery
risks altering brain flow,

35:15.864 --> 35:17.407
it could cause another bleed.

35:17.407 --> 35:19.993
But maybe there's a way
to reduce that risk.

35:20.619 --> 35:24.790
The wait will be hell on the parents,
the whole time knowing their son's brain--

35:24.790 --> 35:27.084
The parents' stress
is not medically relevant.

35:27.084 --> 35:28.752
I know, Shaun, but please...

35:30.796 --> 35:32.422
Can you think of any other way?

35:52.860 --> 35:56.071
An encephalo-duro-arterio-synangiosis
of the left side

35:56.071 --> 35:57.698
would be relatively low risk.

35:57.990 --> 35:59.825
We could safely do that now.

36:00.784 --> 36:01.910
Thank you.

36:08.750 --> 36:09.918
Rick, Linda!

36:14.339 --> 36:15.674
The surgery went well.

36:39.823 --> 36:43.952
There she is, right on schedule.

36:44.536 --> 36:45.662
How do you feel?

36:47.539 --> 36:49.666
Like I can breathe.

36:50.042 --> 36:52.085
For the first time in a long time.

36:53.003 --> 36:54.755
Thank Dr. Lim for me.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.258
I will.

37:00.594 --> 37:03.013
Somebody's all puffed up.

37:05.432 --> 37:07.225
You did something...

37:09.978 --> 37:12.439
The surgical team got a little stuck.

37:13.357 --> 37:15.108
I just gave them a new idea.

37:17.069 --> 37:18.320
Good job.

37:20.030 --> 37:23.575
Wow, you're a doctor.

37:23.575 --> 37:27.496
Wow, okay. You're laying
on a little too thick now.

37:35.420 --> 37:38.298
Looking good. How are you feeling?

37:39.591 --> 37:40.884
Okay.

37:42.427 --> 37:43.929
Can you give me a high five?

37:46.306 --> 37:47.516
High ten?

37:48.600 --> 37:50.394
Good job.

37:50.394 --> 37:51.645
Good boy buddy.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.773
Where is Patches?

37:54.773 --> 37:57.359
He is right here.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.285
You did do the brain surgery on him.

38:07.786 --> 38:11.915
No. I just put bandages on his head
to make you feel better.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.459
I do.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.940
I'm sorry, there's a meeting.

38:36.940 --> 38:39.443
I know. N.A. right?

38:41.403 --> 38:42.696
Yeah.

38:44.197 --> 38:46.742
Took me a few minutes
to get the courage to come in.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.374
It's just us. Sorry.

38:55.959 --> 38:57.878
Where two or more are gathered...

39:03.550 --> 39:05.343
Have a seat, please.

39:18.398 --> 39:23.153
Hi. I'm Danny. And...

39:23.987 --> 39:26.364
I'm an addict.

39:37.459 --> 39:38.877
Almost show time.

39:39.336 --> 39:41.588
Don't say it like that,
you make me nervous.

39:41.588 --> 39:44.049
Be yourself. That's more than enough.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.347
Hi, everybody.

39:52.224 --> 39:53.934
There's so many of you.

39:55.102 --> 39:56.645
That's so good to see.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.981
I'm Doctor Jordan Allen,

39:59.981 --> 40:04.111
and I'm a third year surgical resident
at St. Bonaventure Hospital.

40:10.367 --> 40:11.743
Where's Glassy?

40:12.160 --> 40:15.247
He will not be staying with us anymore.

40:15.872 --> 40:18.208
- He moved out?
- Yes.

40:18.667 --> 40:21.336
We had a talk and decided it was best.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.588
Did you tell him
I was complaining about him?

40:23.588 --> 40:24.714
Yes.

40:24.714 --> 40:27.384
Shaun, now I feel horrible.

40:29.719 --> 40:30.887
You don't need to.

40:30.887 --> 40:33.473
He found a vacant apartment
just down the hall.

40:34.724 --> 40:36.017
In this building?

40:36.852 --> 40:38.854
- Yes.
- He's our next-door neighbor?

40:38.854 --> 40:41.273
Our next-door neighbor's
next-door neighbor.
