00:07.608 --> 00:11.579
- *

00:11.679 --> 00:15.083
- Phoebe, what do you think
of my painting of Max?

00:16.650 --> 00:19.487
- Clearly you've never
seen Max in a toga.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.422
- I have up here.

00:29.563 --> 00:30.931
- Late again?

00:31.031 --> 00:34.268
- Yeah, I have this thing
where I don't care.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.570
- Oh, Max, I meant to ask you.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.539
Which one of your masterpieces

00:38.639 --> 00:40.007
would you like to donate

00:40.108 --> 00:41.842
to tomorrow's
school art auction?

00:41.942 --> 00:43.577
- Gosh, Mrs. Matson,
I don't know.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.947
There's so many to choose from.
- Hmm.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.551
- [mocking] So many
to choose from.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.986
- Maybe I'll make a new one.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.788
- Well, whatever it is, Max,
I'm sure it will bring in

00:54.888 --> 00:56.957
a lot of money for the school.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.128
Phoebe, when are you going
to start your project?

01:00.228 --> 01:02.130
- Um, actually,
I just finished it.

01:02.163 --> 01:05.133
I call it... "Horse."

01:05.199 --> 01:07.735
-Looks like it was
made by a horse.

01:09.970 --> 01:11.872
- Max, funny and talented.

01:11.972 --> 01:15.008
And Phoebe... always on time.

01:17.178 --> 01:18.446
- I don't get it.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.748
Why is art so easy for you
and so hard for me?

01:20.848 --> 01:22.150
We're twins.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.518
- Let's ask your horse monster.

01:24.618 --> 01:27.388
Throw me in the garbage, Max!

01:27.488 --> 01:29.323
Neighhhh!

01:36.164 --> 01:37.865
- Max!

01:37.965 --> 01:40.401
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Matson,
I didn't see it there.

01:40.501 --> 01:44.172
- MRS. MATSON: It's beautiful.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.540
- What?
- What?

01:46.640 --> 01:50.811
- Even when you fall,
you create magic.

01:50.911 --> 01:54.081
Take it in, class.

01:54.182 --> 01:56.250
- I can do that, too, you know.

01:56.350 --> 02:02.556
Hmm...
- [splash]

02:02.656 --> 02:05.459
- I call this one

02:05.559 --> 02:08.462
"How much do I owe you
for those shoes?"

02:11.899 --> 02:14.268
- *

02:14.368 --> 02:17.271
- WOMAN: * What you see
is not what you get *

02:17.371 --> 02:20.474
* Living our lives
with a secret *

02:20.574 --> 02:23.777
* We fit right in,
bet you never guessed *

02:23.877 --> 02:26.947
* Living our lives
just like all the rest *

02:27.047 --> 02:30.518
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

02:30.618 --> 02:33.921
* Look closer, you might
see the crazy things we do *

02:34.021 --> 02:36.957
* This isn't make-believe,
it's our reality *

02:37.057 --> 02:39.993
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

02:40.093 --> 02:41.795
* And stay out of trouble

02:41.895 --> 02:45.766
* Living a double life

02:55.042 --> 02:56.577
- What?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.078
Another one?

02:58.246 --> 03:00.881
- I told you the costume
shop was having a sale.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.585
- Not your costume, Colosso.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.120
I just lost another
follower on Evilgram.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.257
Why do you think
I'm losing so many?

03:09.290 --> 03:11.158
- 'Cause moving here
made you soft.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.660
You used to post
pics of yourself

03:12.760 --> 03:14.528
firing rockets at satellites.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.698
Now you're just waiting for me
to sit on a whoopee cushion.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.000
- [farting sound]

03:20.100 --> 03:22.536
- [laughs] That's funny--
I gotta post that.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.937
- No, you don't.

03:24.037 --> 03:28.376
Hi-yaaaah!

03:28.476 --> 03:31.144
Waaaaaa...

03:31.279 --> 03:34.715
I just saved you from losing
more followers!

03:34.815 --> 03:36.149
- You're right.

03:36.284 --> 03:38.486
I gotta get my edge back.

03:38.586 --> 03:41.322
Let's get a picture
of me taking out a satellite.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.023
- COLOSSO: Attaboy.

03:43.123 --> 03:46.527
- [laughs]

03:46.627 --> 03:49.062
- Now what are we
going to do next time?

03:50.898 --> 03:54.067
- Take the selfie before
I light the fuse.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.537
- Yes, grasshopper.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.345
- Oh... you found
the art supplies.

04:06.514 --> 04:08.582
- Yeah, weird, they were
in the back of the garage

04:08.682 --> 04:12.320
under the power tools in this
box labeled "Keep Out."

04:12.353 --> 04:13.487
- Uhh...
- Really?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.088
- Weird!
- Anyway...

04:15.188 --> 04:17.325
now with a little hard
work, my art can earn

04:17.391 --> 04:19.226
more money at
the auction than Max's.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.594
- That's the spirit, Phoebe!

04:20.694 --> 04:22.330
Keep reaching for the stars!

04:22.430 --> 04:25.198
Just don't paint them.
- [laughs]

04:25.333 --> 04:27.000
- Hey, hey, you two--let's...

04:27.100 --> 04:28.336
- I'm sorry.

04:28.402 --> 04:31.004
It's just she keep ruining
the refrigerator for me.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.445
- Nothing can ruin
the refrigerator for you, Dad.

04:42.249 --> 04:44.352
- Listen, we're gonna
support Phoebe, all right?

04:44.452 --> 04:46.754
That's why I signed your dad
up to be the auctioneer

04:46.854 --> 04:48.656
at the art fundraiser.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.425
- Why, because I'm loud,
boisterous, and in your face?

04:51.525 --> 04:52.726
- Mm-hmm.
- [shouting] Sold to my wife

04:52.826 --> 04:55.262
who knows me so well!

04:55.363 --> 04:58.265
- [shouting] Why are we yelling?

04:58.366 --> 05:01.869
- That's how auctioneers
get people to pay for art.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.372
- You have to get people
to pay for Phoebe's art?

05:04.472 --> 05:06.874
- [shouting] You're gonna
need a lot more than yelling!

05:19.587 --> 05:20.854
- I see you found
the 10-foot-pole

05:20.954 --> 05:22.456
girls won't go near you with.

05:22.556 --> 05:24.692
Whoa!

05:24.792 --> 05:27.828
- No, I'm going to vault myself
into the Hiddenville Zoo

05:27.928 --> 05:30.464
and then recruit a gorilla army.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.000
I'll have my Evilgram
followers back by midnight.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.969
- [crash]

05:36.069 --> 05:38.406
- Ooh...

05:38.472 --> 05:41.108
Mom's gonna be mad
at you for that!

05:42.976 --> 05:45.846
- And you're gonna be
mad at me for doing this.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.248
- [crash]
- MAX: Ow!

05:51.318 --> 05:53.120
- Come on, Phoebe, you can make
something better than Max

05:53.220 --> 05:54.722
for the art auction!

05:54.822 --> 05:56.857
Art powers, activate!

05:56.957 --> 06:02.029
- [classical music]

06:27.688 --> 06:28.956
- I've done it!

06:29.056 --> 06:32.025
I knew if I just put my heart
into it, I could create...

06:32.125 --> 06:34.027
Mt. Suckamanjaro.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.499
No one's gonna
pay money for this.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.701
They'll be too busy throwing up.

06:42.470 --> 06:45.939
- [panting]

06:48.208 --> 06:51.211
I feel like your
art project looks.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.614
- Uh, rough night at the zoo?

06:55.883 --> 06:57.918
- Turns out gorillas
really like playing

06:58.018 --> 06:59.920
Max in the Middle.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.796
Not giving up yet, Colosso.

07:08.896 --> 07:13.233
I will post something devious to
prove that I am not going soft.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.736
- Will that be before or after

07:15.836 --> 07:18.806
your lilac-scented bubble bath?

07:18.906 --> 07:20.808
- Oh, I'm sorry,
did the gorillas

07:20.908 --> 07:24.745
use you as a soccer ball or me?

07:24.845 --> 07:28.015
- Max, you've gotta tell me
how do you get your art ideas?

07:28.115 --> 07:29.416
Do you think about them?

07:29.517 --> 07:30.584
DO you not think about them?

07:30.684 --> 07:34.087
Do you take bubble baths
in front of Colosso?

07:34.187 --> 07:36.524
- Phoebe, my artistic brilliance

07:36.590 --> 07:38.358
is not something
that can be taught.

07:38.526 --> 07:42.295
My art projects come from
a place deep within my soul.

07:42.395 --> 07:43.631
- [zooming sound]

07:43.731 --> 07:47.367
- Here's your
latest art project, Max.

07:47.535 --> 07:50.904
- I think Billy has
keys to your soul.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.940
I can't believe you've been
using him to fetch art for you

07:53.040 --> 07:54.407
from around the world.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.876
- Actually, I get
them from a dumpster

07:55.976 --> 07:59.613
behind the art
school across town.

07:59.713 --> 08:03.551
- You're not an artist
at all--you're a trash man.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.586
- Hey, Billy's a trash man.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.621
I'm the guy that's gonna
make more money than you

08:07.721 --> 08:09.056
at the art auction.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.258
- How lazy, how despicable...

08:11.358 --> 08:14.595
how quickly can you get me
something better than Max's?

08:14.695 --> 08:15.863
- Don't do it, Billy.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.631
- [sighs] Sorry,
Phoebe, I work for Max.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.900
- Here's 20 bucks.
- Sorry, Max, I work for Phoebe.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.670
- [zooming sound]

08:27.708 --> 08:30.310
- Wow, Max, that's
a beautiful painting.

08:30.410 --> 08:33.581
It really shows your
sweet, sensitive side.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.216
- That's a problem--I'll fix it.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.156
- [scoffs] So you
like girls with goatees.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.059
* Noted

08:48.729 --> 08:50.964
- Oh, Phoebe, take Max's vase

08:51.064 --> 08:53.233
over to the masterpiece corner.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.836
- Um, actually, Ms.
Matson, I made this.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.438
- Really? It's stunning.

08:58.606 --> 09:00.240
Well, I take back everything
I was saying about you

09:00.340 --> 09:02.610
in the teacher's lounge.
- Ha!

09:06.113 --> 09:10.217
- You might be giving
Max a run for his money.

09:10.317 --> 09:13.954
- Well, I gave
somebody money to run.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.723
- [in country accent]
Going once, twice,

09:15.823 --> 09:18.458
sold to Principal Bradford!

09:18.626 --> 09:21.194
That's my cowboy
auctioneer voice.

09:21.294 --> 09:23.697
[in British accent] I can also
do a fancy-pants auctioneer

09:23.797 --> 09:27.100
if it pleases the principal.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.902
- It doesn't.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.070
I'll be over there...

09:30.170 --> 09:33.006
talking to the single moms.

09:33.106 --> 09:36.076
Joyce, is that a new sweater?

09:36.176 --> 09:37.845
Whaaat?

09:41.514 --> 09:43.116
- Something wrong, Max?

09:43.216 --> 09:45.352
- I'm just losing
followers on Evilgram.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.487
- Aww, well, you've
got lots of friends.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.891
Sarah likes you.

09:50.991 --> 09:54.762
What's that on her face?

09:54.862 --> 09:57.430
- Whole lot of crazy.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.504
- Thanks for the vase, Billy.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.007
Sorry, Max, guess there's a new
fake artist in the family.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.910
- It's dumpster art--
don't be too proud.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.080
- Actually, Phoebe's
is from the museum.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.515
Which reminds me, I gotta
return it before they close.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.085
- That's a funny joke, Billy.

10:18.185 --> 10:21.054
Please tell me
that's a joke, Billy.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.156
- You said you wanted
something better than Max,

10:23.256 --> 10:25.192
so I went to the Hiddenville
Art Museum.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.894
- BOTH: What?!

10:26.994 --> 10:29.162
- Billy, you stole
it from the museum?

10:29.262 --> 10:31.298
- Relax, Phoebe,
it's not worth much.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.366
The sign said it's priceless.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.075
- [smirking] What's priceless

10:42.175 --> 10:45.512
is the look on
Phoebe's face right now.

10:45.612 --> 10:49.382
- Billy, "priceless" means
it's really expensive.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.652
- Where do these
words come from?

10:52.753 --> 10:54.487
- We could go
to jail for stealing.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.356
We've gotta get it back
before the auction starts.

10:56.456 --> 10:57.324
- [gavel raps]

10:57.424 --> 10:58.959
- Let's get
this auction started.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.594
- Yee-hoo!

11:10.103 --> 11:11.839
- We can't let
anybody buy that vase.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.941
How are we gonna fix this?
- We?

11:14.041 --> 11:15.608
This is a you problem,

11:15.743 --> 11:18.245
as in you an art thief, girl.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.617
- All right, Billy,
it's up to us.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.286
As soon as I get
that vase, you take it

11:26.386 --> 11:27.888
and return it to the museum.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.390
- Good evening, parents,
students...

11:30.490 --> 11:32.760
Joyce.

11:32.826 --> 11:34.762
I'd like to introduce
the only parent

11:34.828 --> 11:36.797
who would agree
to be the auctioneer,

11:36.897 --> 11:39.032
Hank Thunderman.
- [cheering]

11:39.132 --> 11:41.134
- Ha, that's my wife.
[chuckles]

11:41.234 --> 11:44.905
- I'm as surprised
as everyone else.

11:45.005 --> 11:48.776
- All right, let's get
the evening started with...

11:48.876 --> 11:50.510
- Not the vase, not the vase!

11:50.610 --> 11:53.046
- ...this beautiful vase,

11:53.146 --> 11:55.916
which is made by...
Phoebe Thunderman?

11:56.016 --> 11:59.319
Is there another Phoebe
Thunderman at this school?

11:59.419 --> 12:01.088
- Max, did you help
her with that?

12:01.188 --> 12:03.290
- Nope, she stole
it from a museum.

12:03.390 --> 12:07.795
- Oh, silly,
don't be so jealous.

12:07.861 --> 12:11.031
- Okay, let's get
the bidding started at $25.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.466
Do I hear $25--$25.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.335
Thank you, ma'am.
- This is good.

12:15.435 --> 12:17.637
When Mom buys the vase, we can
trick her into giving it to me.

12:17.805 --> 12:20.540
- Fifty dollars.
- What?

12:20.640 --> 12:22.409
- Seventy dollars.

12:22.509 --> 12:24.912
My daughter made that
vase, so you understand.

12:25.012 --> 12:26.713
- I totally get it.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.649
Eighty dollars.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.852
- Oh, it's gonna be like that.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.353
One hundred dollars.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.122
- Okay, could I get $120

12:35.222 --> 12:37.958
from someone I do not
share a bank account with.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.996
One-twenty... anyone?

12:43.096 --> 12:44.597
- Yes, over here.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.834
I can't raise my hand.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.401
- Flapping counts.

12:48.501 --> 12:49.636
- Does it, Hank?

12:49.736 --> 12:53.006
Does it?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.842
- Well, I mean, according
to the auctioneer's handbook--

12:54.942 --> 12:57.144
- Hank!
- Sold to my wife

12:57.244 --> 12:59.479
who is clearly the boss of me.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.149
- [applause]

13:04.651 --> 13:05.919
- Mom, you won my vase.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.320
Here, let me get
it wrapped for you.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.989
Take this to the museum--
I'll handle Mom.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.224
- Okay.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.426
- [vase shatters]

13:13.526 --> 13:16.196
- Oh, no, my masterpiece.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.998
- Phoebe, what happened?

13:18.098 --> 13:19.732
I don't know--it just slipped,

13:19.867 --> 13:21.701
but I will make you
another one, I promise.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.436
In fact, I'll go
do that right now.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.938
- Aww, that's too bad.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.307
Yeah... make sure she pays.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.712
- What's going on?

13:32.880 --> 13:33.947
Why are you smiling?

13:34.047 --> 13:35.949
- Just taking care of problems.

13:36.049 --> 13:39.887
- I was too late--
the museum's closed.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.521
- Why are you still smiling?

13:41.621 --> 13:45.025
- 'Cause my face
freezes when I freak out.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.426
- It's okay, Phoebe.

13:46.526 --> 13:49.963
I hear we get pudding in jail.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.899
- No one's going to jail.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.166
We are still gonna
return the vase.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.903
We just have to sneak in after
hours without permission.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.505
- You mean break in?

13:58.605 --> 14:00.373
- Don't put Max
words in my mouth.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.910
You make it sound so...
- Evil?

14:03.010 --> 14:04.311
Because it is.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.914
In fact, a break-in selfie
is just what I need

14:06.947 --> 14:08.949
to get my followers
back on Evilgram.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.919
- Ugh, I'm so gonna regret this,
but I could use your help.

14:11.952 --> 14:14.587
Nora, Mom and Dad can't
find out that we're...

14:14.687 --> 14:17.690
- ...breaking into a museum.

14:17.790 --> 14:19.192
- Yeah, sure, what he said.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.294
Just keep the auction
going until we get back.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.495
- ...from breaking
into a museum.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.965
- Stop it!

14:25.065 --> 14:30.203
- [suspense music]

14:30.303 --> 14:33.340
- [whistling]

14:48.655 --> 14:50.257
- Okay, we're in.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.524
We just gotta make this quick.

14:51.624 --> 14:54.594
I don't want to know what
jail pudding tastes like.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.497
- Phoebe, relax--I disabled
the security cameras.

14:57.597 --> 15:00.467
- And I found a free
King Tut lollipop.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.802
Mmm... history.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.340
- Art thief action selfie.

15:09.042 --> 15:10.377
- GUARD: [whistling]
- Oh, no.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.711
- Somebody's coming and
we're gonna get caught

15:11.811 --> 15:13.313
and I can't stop smiling again
because I'm freaking out.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.415
What are we gonna do?
- Phoebe!

15:15.515 --> 15:17.617
Stop smiling and hide!

15:24.324 --> 15:27.627
- [whistling]

15:32.499 --> 15:35.235
- [sighs] This
pitcher's getting heavy.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.504
- Technically the Egyptians
called that a ewer.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.172
- Technically it's gonna
make the same noise

15:39.272 --> 15:42.742
when it hits the floor.

15:42.842 --> 15:46.046
- Hang in there, guys,
he'll be gone soon.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.549
- Time for my nightly break.

15:49.649 --> 15:52.019
My nightly dance break.

15:52.085 --> 15:55.388
[beatboxing]

16:00.627 --> 16:02.629
- I don't know who
looks more ridiculous...

16:02.729 --> 16:04.664
us or him.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.468
I'm gonna go with him.
- Yeah, definitely him.

16:13.040 --> 16:16.109
- Okay, folks, we are
down to our last item.

16:16.209 --> 16:18.511
- Last item... oh, no.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.380
- Oh, that must be
Max's painting.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.748
Where is he, anyway?

16:21.848 --> 16:22.782
- With Phoebe.
- Where's Phoebe?

16:22.882 --> 16:23.783
- With Billy.
- Where's Billy?

16:23.883 --> 16:24.817
- With Max.
- Where's--

16:24.917 --> 16:27.287
- Shh... the auction's starting.

16:27.387 --> 16:29.056
- Who wants to start the bidding

16:29.122 --> 16:31.791
on my son's one-of-a-kind...

16:31.891 --> 16:34.461
bearded girl?

16:34.561 --> 16:37.630
Um, who would like to start
the bidding at $25.

16:37.730 --> 16:38.931
- Twenty-five!

16:39.066 --> 16:41.101
- I've got $25 from
the girl I keep telling

16:41.201 --> 16:43.803
to stay out of my yard.

16:43.903 --> 16:46.206
Do I have $30... anyone?

16:46.306 --> 16:47.840
Anybody?

16:47.940 --> 16:50.843
- You gonna bid on Max's
painting, Mom?

16:50.943 --> 16:54.814
That? Looks like it
came from a dumpster.

16:54.914 --> 16:57.784
- I get it--you love
Phoebe the most.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.920
- That's not true.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.823
- If only there was a way
for you to prove it.

17:03.923 --> 17:06.126
- HANK: Twenty-five going
once, going twice...

17:06.226 --> 17:07.660
- [shouting] Twenty-six dollars.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.363
I love my son!

17:10.463 --> 17:14.201
- Twenty-seven...
I love your son more.

17:14.301 --> 17:15.802
- Twenty-eight dollars.
- Twenty-nine.

17:15.902 --> 17:17.504
- Thirty!

17:23.743 --> 17:25.312
- [clang]

17:25.412 --> 17:28.515
- [techno music from headphones]

17:33.253 --> 17:35.955
- This is not the kind
of evil I was hoping for.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.390
- I know, all this gold

17:37.490 --> 17:40.127
is giving me a kink in my neck.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.429
- That's what
you're thinking about?

17:42.529 --> 17:44.931
- Well, that and I
shouldn't care so much

17:45.031 --> 17:46.466
about competing with you.

17:46.566 --> 17:47.967
- Phoebe, it's not a
competition.

17:48.135 --> 17:50.270
We're on a team--
I'm the captain,

17:50.370 --> 17:53.173
you're the weird bus driver
that takes us to away games.

17:53.273 --> 17:57.610
- I am not Bus Driver Sally.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.546
- BILLY: Uh-oh, bad news, guys!

17:59.646 --> 18:01.181
- Oh, do you have to go
to the bathroom?

18:01.281 --> 18:03.916
- Well, I do now.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.918
I was talking about the guard.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.988
He knows the vase is missing.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.991
- Joe... Joe, you
gotta get down here.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.960
The bird vase is missing.

18:14.060 --> 18:16.896
[laughs] No, I wasn't dancing!

18:19.466 --> 18:20.933
- Billy, his back
is turned--go now.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.570
- You want me to go to
the bathroom in the ewer.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.538
Okay...
- PHOEBE: No!

18:25.638 --> 18:27.407
Go put the bird vase back!

18:27.507 --> 18:29.209
- Oh, right.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.847
- Good job, Billy.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.417
Max?

18:37.517 --> 18:39.419
Yeah, I snuck in here,

18:39.519 --> 18:42.189
but don't tell your mummy.

18:44.424 --> 18:46.359
- This isn't happening!

18:46.459 --> 18:48.094
Get back here, Max!

18:56.403 --> 18:58.571
- Wait...

18:58.671 --> 19:01.341
something's not
right here, either.

19:03.243 --> 19:06.446
- All right, what's
going on, Happy Feet?

19:06.546 --> 19:08.948
- I was patrolling, not dancing,

19:09.048 --> 19:10.950
when I noticed
the bird vase was gone.

19:14.020 --> 19:17.357
- What are you talking
about--it's right there.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.226
- [clank echoes from far away]

19:22.795 --> 19:24.964
- You want to explain that?

19:29.101 --> 19:31.371
- I am not a good guard, am I?

19:35.808 --> 19:38.711
- Escape selfie.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.950
- One-hundred and forty.
- Hundred and forty-one.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.918
- One-hundred and forty-two.
- One-hundred forty-three.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.288
- One-hundred forty-four.
- Two hundred dollars.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.790
[gasps] I don't
have that much money.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.593
- [gasps] Then I guess ya lose.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.896
- This doesn't
have to end, Sarah.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.698
You can borrow money
from your parents,

19:58.798 --> 20:02.001
skip college, get
a small business loan.

20:02.101 --> 20:03.770
- Or...

20:05.738 --> 20:07.807
I win, suckas!

20:07.907 --> 20:10.477
[laughs maniacally]

20:10.577 --> 20:12.945
- Never bet on crazy.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.448
- Well, that's it, folks.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.617
As they say
in the auction game,

20:17.717 --> 20:19.419
I bid you farewell.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.521
- Go home, Hank.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.423
In fact, let's
all get out of here.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.792
Joyce, you with me?

20:25.892 --> 20:28.561
Where's Joyce?

20:28.661 --> 20:31.864
I hate this school.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.133
- So you're probably
still wondering

20:34.233 --> 20:36.202
where Max, Phoebe,
and Billy are.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.870
Don't get mad, but they're--

20:37.970 --> 20:41.040
- They're right here.

20:41.140 --> 20:43.743
- And Phoebe didn't
make you a new vase.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.978
Maybe you're right
to love Max more.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.348
- [scoffs] Guys,
I want to talk to you

20:48.448 --> 20:49.849
about something Nora said.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.652
- Nora's a liar!

20:52.752 --> 20:54.220
- [sighs]

20:54.321 --> 20:56.222
- She's just confused.

20:56.323 --> 20:58.758
I don't love Phoebe
more than you.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.728
I love you both equally.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.564
- [whispers loudly]
I don't think she knows.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.499
- BARB: Knows what?

21:06.599 --> 21:12.439
- That we love you...
more than Dad?

21:12.539 --> 21:15.342
- Awww... you know,
I always suspected it,

21:15.408 --> 21:17.844
but it's just nice to hear.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.178
Shh.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.755
- [phone jingles]
- Haha!

21:28.855 --> 21:31.558
Thanks to my museum break-in,
my followers are coming back.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.826
- It wasn't a break-in.

21:33.926 --> 21:36.763
I left admission fees
on one of the displays.

21:36.863 --> 21:40.032
- You mean the money I took
to pay for this ice cream?

21:40.132 --> 21:42.835
- Well, it's fine, 'cause
I took the money from you.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.039
I do have one question, though.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.708
Do you have Billy steal your
artwork 'cause you're lazy

21:48.808 --> 21:50.543
or 'cause you're just
horrible at art like me.

21:50.643 --> 21:51.744
- It's 'cause I'm lazy.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.513
I'm actually really good at art.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.482
Here, check this out.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.452
- Wow, that's amazing.

21:59.552 --> 22:02.522
- Yeah, something I threw
together this morning.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.156
- Wait a minute, wasn't
that in the museum?

22:04.256 --> 22:06.393
- Yes, I'm back!

22:11.998 --> 22:16.403
- *
