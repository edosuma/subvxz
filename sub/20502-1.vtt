00:52.268 --> 00:54.069
No, don't!

00:54.769 --> 00:57.633
Stop it! Step off! Step back!

01:05.233 --> 01:06.819
Fuck!

01:41.702 --> 01:44.506
This is yours now! This is your life!

01:47.301 --> 01:49.101
What use are you?

01:50.797 --> 01:53.230
This ain't worth it!

01:53.901 --> 01:55.755
Fuck it!

01:57.534 --> 01:58.920
Fuck everyone!

03:04.369 --> 03:06.252
It's fine.

03:08.635 --> 03:10.685
I mean, you want me to call anyone?

03:13.302 --> 03:15.552
Nah, no, no. I...

03:15.968 --> 03:19.818
Just have to, uh... won't be here long. Um...

03:25.934 --> 03:27.902
- Clover, you're...
- No, I... I'm fine.

03:28.002 --> 03:30.202
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.

03:30.302 --> 03:32.919
Well, let me know about
the funeral, won't you?

03:37.502 --> 03:39.385
Yeah, of course.

03:40.701 --> 03:42.302
Now, if there's anything else I can do...

03:42.402 --> 03:44.969
Can you make it my dad instead of my brother?

03:45.069 --> 03:46.886
Can you make that happen?

03:50.302 --> 03:52.386
Just trying to help, Clover.

05:59.302 --> 06:01.768
Right, then. Take care.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.585
You...

06:13.369 --> 06:15.185
...you came!

06:16.935 --> 06:18.986
Bloody good show, Clover.

06:20.801 --> 06:22.685
Well done, that girl.

06:25.034 --> 06:27.168
What's all the mess?

06:27.268 --> 06:29.934
- Did you have a party?
- Yes.

06:30.134 --> 06:32.019
Yes, for Harry.

06:32.902 --> 06:34.035
Why?

06:34.135 --> 06:36.620
Well, his taking over the farm.

06:38.269 --> 06:40.734
Harry didn't tell me
you'd given him the farm.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.850
You... you didn't want to come,
did you, to the party?

06:43.950 --> 06:46.153
You never want to come.

06:47.734 --> 06:51.420
Well, you're here now. Stay for the funeral.

06:52.768 --> 06:54.601
Of course.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.019
What's this?

07:01.802 --> 07:03.369
Home.

07:03.968 --> 07:07.402
- Since when?
- Since the house flooded.

07:07.501 --> 07:09.769
Our very own refugee camp.

07:10.269 --> 07:12.069
But that was months ago.

07:12.568 --> 07:15.452
Bloody insurance company wouldn't pay out.

07:35.302 --> 07:37.269
What happened?

07:37.668 --> 07:39.485
Helen wouldn't say.

07:47.002 --> 07:48.852
He took...

07:50.501 --> 07:52.353
He was...

07:56.235 --> 07:58.269
Oh, gun in the loo.

07:58.768 --> 08:00.835
- But...
- Everyone was plastered.

08:00.935 --> 08:04.834
- He shot himself?
- It was a bloody stupid accident.

08:05.334 --> 08:07.669
Hello. Aubrey?

08:11.202 --> 08:13.020
Oh, James.

08:20.335 --> 08:22.153
Just wanted to check...

08:23.534 --> 08:25.594
...see if you needed anything.

08:26.169 --> 08:28.053
Isn't he wonderful, Clover?

08:29.434 --> 08:33.486
James came to check on us.
He's a rock, a bloody rock.

08:34.769 --> 08:36.668
Has anyone heard a forecast?

08:36.967 --> 08:39.135
I'm sure they said it was gonna rain.

08:39.235 --> 08:41.919
- You hear that, James?
- Yes, sir.

08:43.102 --> 08:45.634
Probably think about digging
some ditches, shouldn't we?

08:45.734 --> 08:47.735
I can talk to some of the others.

08:48.334 --> 08:50.192
Good boy.

09:06.601 --> 09:08.652
Aubrey said it was an accident.

09:18.269 --> 09:21.969
What did the police say?
Did they find a note?

09:22.069 --> 09:23.939
You know as much as I do.

09:26.134 --> 09:27.989
Was it still loaded?
I didn't know it was still loaded.

09:28.089 --> 09:30.685
Well, it must have been.
It blew his face off.

09:39.468 --> 09:41.352
Can you pull over?

09:47.668 --> 09:49.485
Pull over now.

10:12.734 --> 10:14.285
Sorry.

10:15.002 --> 10:16.885
It's fine.

12:03.401 --> 12:05.285
Oh, Harry.

13:16.134 --> 13:17.669
Milo?

13:28.534 --> 13:30.621
What are you doing in there?

13:53.469 --> 13:54.988
Aubrey?

14:02.134 --> 14:03.986
Clever boy, Milo.

14:13.501 --> 14:17.369
Oh. Bloody animal. Wonder where he got to.

14:17.969 --> 14:19.835
He was locked in the shed.

14:20.334 --> 14:22.969
Must have been in there for days.
He was starving.

14:23.368 --> 14:25.186
There was shit everywhere.

14:26.768 --> 14:29.820
- What was he doing in there?
- Can't find a shirt.

14:32.368 --> 14:35.769
- Did you put him in there?
- No, I bloody didn't.

14:36.268 --> 14:39.669
If we get an animal like that at
the practice, Aubrey, we call the police.

14:40.568 --> 14:44.268
Oh, perhaps someone
shut him in during the party.

14:44.368 --> 14:46.803
He's a bugger around sausages.

14:50.835 --> 14:53.166
Look, we've got to sort out
this funeral. Um...

14:53.266 --> 14:57.669
...the morgue wants to know
about the, uh, date and our wishes.

14:57.968 --> 14:59.001
- Later.
- So...

14:59.201 --> 15:01.419
We need to milk the cows.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.552
Get your wellies on.

15:06.802 --> 15:08.886
I didn't bring any wellies!

15:35.802 --> 15:38.620
Come on! Come on!

15:39.569 --> 15:41.402
Come on!

15:41.702 --> 15:43.585
Go on.

15:43.968 --> 15:45.552
Hey!

15:46.419 --> 15:48.145
Come on.

16:04.702 --> 16:07.352
No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait. Wait.

16:29.368 --> 16:31.732
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.

16:31.832 --> 16:34.485
Get it straight. See?

16:35.502 --> 16:39.722
Spread 'em out. Right hand.
Right hand. You remember.

16:46.835 --> 16:49.149
Yeah, feel for it. Feel for it.

19:29.301 --> 19:31.185
Ah, come on.

19:44.201 --> 19:45.769
Milo.

20:50.234 --> 20:53.202
- Should I take these ones back to the field?
- No, into the barn.

20:53.302 --> 20:56.734
- What? Why?
- Hatfield's coming to take them away.

20:56.834 --> 20:59.501
You selling stock? How many?

20:59.600 --> 21:02.001
Just half the herd.

21:02.101 --> 21:05.134
Keep some bloodline. Build it up again.

21:05.234 --> 21:09.135
- But you're keeping the pregnant ones?
- No. He's taking those.

21:09.235 --> 21:12.169
- I hope you're getting double the price.
- It's all sorted.

21:12.269 --> 21:15.685
You don't have to worry
your little head about it.

21:24.568 --> 21:26.568
They're here in the barn waiting.

21:26.668 --> 21:29.435
Thought you said noon. Don't think I'm wrong.

21:29.535 --> 21:31.985
Call me back. Cheers, Roger.

21:36.402 --> 21:38.568
Was this Harry's idea?

21:38.668 --> 21:40.486
The sale?

21:40.902 --> 21:42.701
Need the money.

21:44.002 --> 21:46.235
The stock is our only asset.

21:46.335 --> 21:49.102
We sell the stock. We get the money.

21:49.202 --> 21:51.102
The farm is saved.

21:51.202 --> 21:53.269
Harry gets the farm.

21:53.369 --> 21:55.985
We have a party. Everyone's happy.

21:59.634 --> 22:01.719
I don't think Harry was happy.

22:06.169 --> 22:08.835
It was just a bloody stupid accident.

22:10.869 --> 22:14.922
Catto here. Yeah. That's right.

22:15.022 --> 22:17.252
Canceled? What?

22:19.068 --> 22:22.735
Yeah, well, Harry was in charge,
but he should've run that by me.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.601
Course we want to sell them.

22:28.335 --> 22:31.976
Yeah, check. Do that. Call me back.

22:34.002 --> 22:35.869
It's canceled?

22:36.269 --> 22:40.435
Bloody idiots, they've screwed up somewhere.
Harry would never have done that.

22:40.534 --> 22:42.501
Maybe he did.

22:42.601 --> 22:44.135
Don't be so stupid.

22:44.934 --> 22:46.752
I'm not stupid.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.402
- What? What are you on about?
- Stop calling me stupid.

22:50.501 --> 22:53.452
I've got 4 "A" levels, 2 degrees,
and I'm about to be fully qualified as a vet.

22:53.551 --> 22:55.353
I'm not bloody stupid.

23:00.234 --> 23:03.869
So are we leaving the stock up here
or are we taking 'em out to the field?

23:03.969 --> 23:05.882
It's your farm.

23:14.402 --> 23:16.369
Bloody marvelous.

23:16.468 --> 23:18.020
Oh.

23:20.534 --> 23:24.402
- You all came. Bloody marvelous.
- You want some digging done?

23:24.501 --> 23:28.302
Damn right. Uh, you know what
you're doing, where you're going?

23:28.402 --> 23:30.869
- Afraid the bloody digger's buggered.
- We brought spades.

23:30.969 --> 23:33.785
Good man. Let me take you up there.

23:34.335 --> 23:38.386
Uh, sort this, will you?
I'll walk the boys up to the site.

23:43.701 --> 23:45.235
Hello.

23:45.934 --> 23:48.601
Are you, uh... are you Mrs. Catto?

23:48.701 --> 23:51.902
Uh, Clover. What's going on?

23:52.302 --> 23:54.402
We've released the licensed weapons.

23:54.501 --> 23:57.934
I've got 'em here as well as
Harry's clothes and things.

23:58.034 --> 24:01.234
- What weapons?
- There's shotguns.

24:01.334 --> 24:04.902
We had to take 'em away on the night,
but we've, uh... we've released 'em now.

24:05.002 --> 24:06.501
Right.

24:07.101 --> 24:08.919
You need to lock them up.

24:33.969 --> 24:36.035
This was round his neck.

24:36.634 --> 24:38.452
Don't know if you...

24:43.468 --> 24:45.869
Do you have a day for the funeral yet?

24:46.468 --> 24:48.335
Not yet.

24:48.434 --> 24:50.734
You're not waiting for us, are you?

24:50.834 --> 24:52.635
Well, um...

24:53.734 --> 24:57.401
There will be an inquest
as with all suicides, but...

24:57.501 --> 25:01.069
...there won't be any further investigation
if that's what you're worried about.

25:01.169 --> 25:04.620
So you're ruling it a suicide,
not an accident?

25:06.935 --> 25:09.760
I... I mean, it's not official yet, but...

26:23.668 --> 26:26.300
<i>Steady. Stop laughing as well.</i>

26:26.800 --> 26:28.634
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

26:29.433 --> 26:33.698
- <i>How does it feel?</i>
- <i>Like tiny butterflies kissing my wrist.</i>

26:33.798 --> 26:35.334
<i>Fuck.</i>

26:35.934 --> 26:38.135
<i>So we never forget. Yeah.</i>

26:38.235 --> 26:43.035
<i>Only moving 200 cattle off our land in
four foot of water at 2:00 in the morning.</i>

26:43.634 --> 26:45.719
<i>Then, fuck, for you, man.</i>

26:47.534 --> 26:49.418
<i>Your tur...</i>

27:00.668 --> 27:03.568
<i>Steady. Stop laughing as well.</i>

27:03.668 --> 27:05.486
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

27:16.668 --> 27:20.035
- So were you at the party, then?
- Yep.

27:20.135 --> 27:22.155
Is that where you got the shiner?

27:36.334 --> 27:38.852
Was Harry happy about getting the farm?

27:39.401 --> 27:42.634
- Was a pretty big deal for him, wasn't it?
- Yeah, of course.

27:42.734 --> 27:45.201
I mean, finally Aubrey trusted him.

27:45.301 --> 27:47.585
He's not the easiest dad in the world.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.952
Harry was really chuffed.

27:52.834 --> 27:55.601
I think maybe Aubrey
was still trying to run the farm...

27:55.701 --> 27:58.785
...with the sale and everything,
like he didn't trust Harry?

28:00.034 --> 28:03.452
Is that why he canceled the sale,
do you think? He had other plans?

28:06.201 --> 28:07.184
What's that?

28:07.284 --> 28:09.935
I don't know. Think we should
just smooth around and carry on.

28:10.035 --> 28:11.919
Hang on.

28:21.234 --> 28:23.652
Is that a badger? Jesus Christ.

28:27.434 --> 28:30.935
- There are more.
- Can you tell what happened to them?

28:32.134 --> 28:34.356
They've been shot. For fuck's sake.

28:35.401 --> 28:38.334
No, Milo! Oh, can you get him away?
Could you just go lock him up somewhere?

28:38.434 --> 28:41.035
Where are you going?
You're not going to call the police, are you?

28:41.134 --> 28:43.619
Fucking Aubrey. Fuck!

28:45.764 --> 28:48.601
Very well. Bye.

28:58.069 --> 28:59.134
Where are you going?

28:59.234 --> 29:01.869
Roger needs some more paperwork
for this damn sale.

29:01.969 --> 29:05.168
- They think you're hiding something, do they?
- Oh, don't be so bloody ridiculous.

29:05.268 --> 29:06.970
I just found dead badgers
buried out the back.

29:07.070 --> 29:09.470
- What? Where?
- Shot dead.

29:10.869 --> 29:14.983
Killing badgers is the fastest bloody way
to get thrown in clink. I'm not that stupid.

29:15.083 --> 29:17.332
Okay, fine. You know best.

29:19.968 --> 29:24.569
I didn't have the keys to the gun cupboard.
I gave them to Harry about 6 months ago.

29:24.669 --> 29:26.434
Harry?

29:26.534 --> 29:30.201
Well, he wouldn't. He's not stupid.
He... he isn't that stupid.

29:30.301 --> 29:33.434
Frankly, the only stupid thing
he's done is burying them.

29:33.534 --> 29:38.199
He should've burned the bloody things.
If they'd had T.B., we'd be buggered!

29:57.734 --> 29:59.785
The police say it was suicide.

30:00.402 --> 30:02.285
Accidental death.

30:06.234 --> 30:08.905
You don't accidentally
put a gun in your mouth.

30:09.534 --> 30:13.219
- You weren't here.
- James was, and he agrees.

30:14.568 --> 30:19.085
But he didn't mean to shoot himself.
I'd just given him the farm, for God's sake.

30:22.735 --> 30:24.401
Did he say anything to you?

30:24.501 --> 30:27.335
About what, the bloody badgers?
He was a grown-up.

30:27.435 --> 30:29.234
Before he shot himself.

30:30.033 --> 30:32.062
He was drunk!

30:52.368 --> 30:54.603
Your first letter from boarding school.

30:56.101 --> 30:58.702
You wrote it to Sandy,
because you were cross with me.

30:58.802 --> 31:01.134
Sandy? The dog Sandy?

31:01.234 --> 31:03.102
The one you shot.

31:03.562 --> 31:08.151
"Please tell Daddy that I have to eat
corned beef here and it's not beef at all."

31:08.901 --> 31:13.335
"It's bloody freezing here
and my socks all have holes in them."

31:21.669 --> 31:23.502
I hated boarding school.

31:24.101 --> 31:27.302
No, you didn't. Harry hated boarding school.

31:27.902 --> 31:31.920
- He never went. He got to stay here.
- He did. He went for a term.

31:32.502 --> 31:34.302
Cried the whole time.

31:35.101 --> 31:39.385
Came back home to the farmyard
happy as a pig in shit.

31:40.802 --> 31:42.635
You loved it there.

31:43.034 --> 31:47.272
"Give mummy a big lick from me
and tell her I'll be home soon."

31:50.134 --> 31:52.902
The riding, too. You were pony mad.

31:53.001 --> 31:56.019
- Kept me busy, didn't it?
- Hmm?

31:59.001 --> 32:00.553
Nothing.

32:12.569 --> 32:14.619
When did you leave the army?

32:16.602 --> 32:19.085
Uh, my father got ill.

32:20.401 --> 32:22.202
My mother was dead.

32:22.502 --> 32:26.569
Your mother wanted to have children,
so we came back to the farm.

32:26.669 --> 32:30.101
- They're good places for children, farms.
- What about you? Didn't you want children?

32:30.201 --> 32:32.085
Of course I did.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.735
Only if they were like you.

32:36.835 --> 32:39.252
Well, I got that, didn't I? Bloody hell.

32:41.402 --> 32:44.355
I never knew what made my mother
so angry until I heard you...

32:44.455 --> 32:46.469
...telling me how to run my farm.

32:47.368 --> 32:49.252
You were impossible.

32:49.669 --> 32:51.919
Never met such a born farmer.

32:54.401 --> 32:56.469
So you gave the farm to Harry?

32:56.569 --> 32:58.452
You left.

33:03.768 --> 33:05.585
You told me to go.

33:06.301 --> 33:09.402
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did. I was 18.

33:09.502 --> 33:12.101
You told me to get the hell out of here...

33:12.201 --> 33:14.002
...and then nothing.

33:14.802 --> 33:17.702
- No phone call. No apology.
- You were being bloody impossible.

33:17.802 --> 33:19.334
I was 18.

33:19.434 --> 33:21.675
Exactly. You weren't in charge.

33:21.775 --> 33:24.201
- It was my farm.
- You expected my respect?

33:24.301 --> 33:27.583
Yes, I bloody expected your respect.
I was your father.

33:27.683 --> 33:31.152
You were the man who left me at
boarding school when my mother died.

33:32.101 --> 33:33.802
Didn't bring me home for her funeral.

33:33.901 --> 33:36.502
What's that got to do with it?
That was years before.

33:36.602 --> 33:38.420
So it didn't matter?

33:40.834 --> 33:43.077
Was it better to forget about it?

33:45.502 --> 33:47.068
My mother?

33:47.168 --> 33:49.185
Yes, Clover, yes.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.197
That's how it works.

33:53.734 --> 33:56.369
You have to forget about it and then move on.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.302
And change the subject
every time she's mentioned?

33:58.402 --> 34:01.735
You have to get up, get out of bed...

34:01.834 --> 34:04.253
...and milk the bloody cows.

34:24.101 --> 34:25.985
You sure this thing's up here?

34:30.400 --> 34:32.471
I shouldn't think so for a minute.

34:35.868 --> 34:37.753
Should we go, then?

35:02.101 --> 35:05.268
Hi. Mr. Jones? It's Clover.

35:05.368 --> 35:07.202
Hi. Uh...

35:07.602 --> 35:10.819
...I'm okay. Uh, it's fine. Um, I just, uh...

35:12.301 --> 35:14.520
I've just found some badgers on the farm.

35:15.469 --> 35:18.102
Dead ones, shot.

35:18.202 --> 35:19.706
Um...

35:20.137 --> 35:23.435
...I just wondered if...
I know. I know. I just, um...

35:23.535 --> 35:27.612
...I need them off the farm. I...
could you ask animal health if they...

35:27.801 --> 35:31.665
No, no... not the police. Um, please.

35:32.901 --> 35:34.785
You'll be my best friend.

35:37.385 --> 35:39.185
Thank you.

35:39.635 --> 35:41.220
Thanks.

37:21.269 --> 37:22.768
Right.

39:36.202 --> 39:37.752
Clover.

39:41.335 --> 39:43.969
- It's me, Helen.
- Helen.

39:44.568 --> 39:46.453
How are you doing?

39:47.435 --> 39:49.315
I'm so sorry, my love.

39:50.034 --> 39:52.969
How are you? Did you do all this?

39:53.069 --> 39:56.001
Oh, well, it was a big occasion...

39:56.101 --> 39:58.102
...Harry finally getting the farm.

39:58.202 --> 40:01.837
Lovely for everyone, really,
after the year we've had.

40:03.702 --> 40:06.369
- Were you here?
- No.

40:06.868 --> 40:09.035
No, I'd gone to bed by then.

40:09.135 --> 40:11.019
Bit late for me.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.320
This is for you and your dad.

40:15.235 --> 40:17.035
Shepherd's pie.

40:17.135 --> 40:19.135
Stew. Easy stuff.

40:19.235 --> 40:22.468
Don't worry about the Tupperware.
I'll get that back whenever.

40:22.568 --> 40:24.103
Okay.

40:24.602 --> 40:26.835
Do you need anything else, my love?

40:27.335 --> 40:29.186
I'm all set.

40:32.802 --> 40:34.386
Helen.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.020
Thanks for calling me.

40:40.369 --> 40:42.634
Aubrey wouldn't have thought to.

40:42.734 --> 40:44.835
He asked me to ring you.

40:44.935 --> 40:47.459
You're never far from his thoughts.

40:52.335 --> 40:54.219
Thank you.

40:56.269 --> 40:58.110
Look who I found.

41:01.468 --> 41:03.568
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:03.668 --> 41:06.935
I thought he could do with some grub.
Been working like a packhorse out there.

41:07.035 --> 41:10.720
- I just need the loo.
- Oh. Light a match, will you?

41:12.702 --> 41:16.798
- I saw Helen. She gave us some food.
- Did she? Oh, good.

41:16.898 --> 41:20.734
- I'm starving. What have we got?
- Shepherd's pie and stuff, I think.

41:21.214 --> 41:23.070
Want a drink?

41:24.468 --> 41:26.814
- Want a drink, James?
- It's a bit early for me.

41:26.914 --> 41:29.289
- Come on. We've got, um...
- Shepherd's pie.

41:29.388 --> 41:31.189
Shepherd's pie.

41:31.289 --> 41:34.633
Oh, come on, Harry. Don't be such a girl.

41:38.102 --> 41:39.919
You be mum.

41:42.501 --> 41:44.020
Mmm.

41:47.601 --> 41:49.469
Where's yours?

41:49.869 --> 41:53.885
- I don't eat meat, Aubrey.
- This isn't meat. This is Shepherd's pie.

41:55.135 --> 41:57.169
You can just eat the potato.

41:57.269 --> 41:59.502
There you go. Just eat the potato.

42:00.002 --> 42:02.253
It's cooked with the meat, though, isn't it?

42:07.501 --> 42:10.661
Vegetables scream. Do you know that? They do.

42:10.761 --> 42:13.534
They scream blue murder
when they're being chopped down.

42:13.634 --> 42:16.334
- That's not true.
- Bloody is.

42:16.434 --> 42:19.601
- You know that, don't you?
- I heard they swear, too.

42:19.701 --> 42:22.069
- In French.
- Oh, <i>Mon dieu.</i>

42:22.169 --> 42:25.041
That's what leeks say. "Mm...

42:25.802 --> 42:27.640
Oh, my roots."

42:27.740 --> 42:31.369
Like some cheap whore.
Oh, look out. There you go.

42:31.469 --> 42:33.434
She's eaten some. Call the papers.

42:33.534 --> 42:35.334
It's just potato.

42:36.235 --> 42:38.053
Look at that smile.

42:39.401 --> 42:40.891
One in a million.

42:58.601 --> 43:00.886
Did you know Harry killed the badgers?

43:03.002 --> 43:04.502
Yes.

43:04.902 --> 43:08.752
How? Did he tell you? Did you catch him?

43:09.935 --> 43:11.769
I helped him shoot them.

43:12.069 --> 43:13.652
Why?

43:14.701 --> 43:16.702
He asked.

43:19.534 --> 43:21.619
Are you gonna tell the police?

43:33.634 --> 43:35.379
What happened at the party, James?

43:35.969 --> 43:37.986
How did he end up in that bathroom?

43:39.634 --> 43:42.669
Why did you never come home after the floods?

43:43.668 --> 43:47.669
Well, we talked about it,
but Harry told me not to.

43:48.368 --> 43:50.986
He said he was fine, he could manage.

43:52.902 --> 43:56.085
- He knew he could ask me anytime.
- You know they're broke, don't you?

43:56.734 --> 43:59.069
The house is a wreck.
Their insurance fucked up.

43:59.169 --> 44:03.035
The land is still full of glass
and all kinds of shit from the floods.

44:03.135 --> 44:06.802
What about all of you, then? How are they
paying all of you? They can't be that broke.

44:06.902 --> 44:10.352
No one's paying us.
No one's paid us for months.

44:13.268 --> 44:15.801
Well, it'll be fine. We're selling stock.

44:15.901 --> 44:19.334
Perfect, so you can sweep in and take over
now. You get everything you always wanted.

44:19.434 --> 44:20.986
What?

44:24.634 --> 44:27.719
- Did Harry say that?
- I gotta go.

44:42.135 --> 44:45.234
So shall we start by choosing the readings?

44:45.334 --> 44:48.135
- Shall I get my Bible?
- No, I came prepared.

44:48.934 --> 44:51.552
Clover, would you like to do a reading?

44:53.201 --> 44:54.768
Sure. Fine.

44:54.868 --> 44:58.598
Is there anything particular
you want to express?

44:58.968 --> 45:03.902
Any part of Harry's life
you want to honor or...

45:04.002 --> 45:06.202
...anything that you're struggling with?

45:07.002 --> 45:08.852
Not sure.

45:12.234 --> 45:13.786
Um...

45:18.601 --> 45:20.669
Don't know what I want to say.

45:21.268 --> 45:24.469
What would you have said about him last week?

45:25.668 --> 45:27.735
Last week, he wasn't dead...

45:28.634 --> 45:31.301
...and I can't un-know
these things about him.

45:31.401 --> 45:35.074
That's the person you're going to miss,
isn't it, the one from last week?

45:36.201 --> 45:38.085
But that person's gone.

45:41.002 --> 45:43.431
And I don't know if he ever really existed.

45:45.819 --> 45:48.048
That person would never have done this.

45:49.101 --> 45:51.119
Would never have killed himself.

45:52.702 --> 45:55.602
When people commit suicide unexpectedly...

45:55.702 --> 45:59.219
...it's natural to want
to make sense of their actions...

45:59.319 --> 46:03.335
...but you're also trying to work out
your place in that story...

46:04.334 --> 46:05.886
...so...

46:06.205 --> 46:09.679
...maybe what you're struggling with is...

46:09.779 --> 46:12.819
...is about you, not him.

46:13.802 --> 46:18.728
Guilt is incredibly common
for survivors of suicides.

46:18.828 --> 46:20.886
I'm not feeling guilt.

46:24.935 --> 46:26.822
I wasn't even here.

47:05.502 --> 47:07.385
Come, Milo!

47:09.402 --> 47:11.252
Milo, come!

47:11.769 --> 47:13.619
Come on.

47:14.802 --> 47:16.626
Good boy.

47:32.269 --> 47:33.520
Milo?

49:10.169 --> 49:12.602
Oh, God.

49:12.802 --> 49:14.853
Oh, shit.

49:50.034 --> 49:51.553
Aubrey.

51:50.402 --> 51:53.432
Hi. I've got lunch.

51:56.702 --> 51:59.734
What was that petrol doing
in the kitchen? The place stinks.

51:59.834 --> 52:02.319
What? What petrol?

52:03.469 --> 52:06.235
Did you have to run a generator
in there or something?

52:14.535 --> 52:16.385
How is the river?

52:18.969 --> 52:20.520
Wet.

52:23.801 --> 52:25.803
We need to talk about the funeral.

52:29.069 --> 52:30.869
About what?

52:31.369 --> 52:35.402
Are we gonna have people here afterwards?
Shall I talk to Helen about it?

52:35.502 --> 52:37.769
Larry's offered the king's arms.

52:38.169 --> 52:40.053
Can do it all there.

52:44.701 --> 52:47.701
And after that, what are
you gonna do on the farm?

52:48.401 --> 52:51.403
You okay to look after it
by yourself? Because...

52:51.503 --> 52:55.251
...I should get back to college,
really, but...

53:00.102 --> 53:01.685
Aubrey.

53:04.535 --> 53:06.369
Just go.

53:06.668 --> 53:10.019
You always did what you wanted.
No reason to stop now.

53:11.802 --> 53:13.336
What?

53:14.435 --> 53:16.520
You're not cut out for this.

53:20.502 --> 53:22.085
Fine.

53:25.801 --> 53:30.734
Hi. Um, we were just working around
the back ad there's a new calf there.

53:30.834 --> 53:32.669
- Where?
- In the barn.

53:32.769 --> 53:35.252
Oh, bloody hell.

53:36.435 --> 53:38.802
Ah, stupid bloody animals.

53:38.902 --> 53:40.719
She'll be fine.

53:44.701 --> 53:47.135
Ah, well done, girl.

53:47.235 --> 53:50.852
Good job. Bloody good job.

53:52.135 --> 53:54.019
Seems healthy.

53:54.602 --> 53:57.801
- He's breathing well. Yep.
- Excellent.

54:00.301 --> 54:02.102
It's a boy.

54:02.901 --> 54:05.535
What do you want to do, send it to market?

54:05.634 --> 54:09.235
No use for it here,
and Hatfield won't want it.

54:09.335 --> 54:12.170
- Best to cull it.
- Now?

54:12.869 --> 54:14.669
You're the vet.

54:15.169 --> 54:18.470
- You want me to shoot it?
- Guns are in the cupboard, aren't they?

54:18.570 --> 54:21.069
Can't we give it a day
for them to be together?

54:21.169 --> 54:24.135
She's gonna be full of hormones and
colostrum. We need that out of her.

54:24.235 --> 54:28.102
Best done as soon as possible.
Don't want them getting attached.

54:28.701 --> 54:31.186
Or I could get one of the boys to do it.

56:54.769 --> 56:58.253
- Hi. What's going on?
- Can I show you something?

56:59.701 --> 57:01.519
Yeah, sure.

57:16.634 --> 57:18.169
What?

57:18.568 --> 57:22.202
- Where are you going?
- I just want to show you something in here.

57:22.302 --> 57:24.185
Uh, look...

57:26.035 --> 57:27.824
What, James?

57:27.924 --> 57:30.556
- What's wrong?
- Not that way.

57:30.824 --> 57:33.202
No? Why not?

57:33.302 --> 57:37.320
- Not with that torch.
- Why not, James? Tell me.

57:40.668 --> 57:42.253
Okay.

57:44.401 --> 57:46.269
Let's just go.

57:54.835 --> 57:56.685
So everyone was here.

57:59.634 --> 58:01.886
Aubrey made this big speech about...

58:02.735 --> 58:04.935
...passing it on to Harry...

58:05.834 --> 58:08.515
...future of farming being in our hands.

58:10.434 --> 58:12.286
Then we got drunk.

58:13.434 --> 58:15.235
Really drunk.

58:15.834 --> 58:20.441
We were fire-walking in the back field.
Matilda's lot had laid out the coals.

58:22.501 --> 58:25.108
It was all fun and games till Harry did it.

58:27.634 --> 58:29.734
He wouldn't get off.

58:29.834 --> 58:32.035
He was just standing on the coals...

58:32.434 --> 58:34.519
...beating his chest, and roaring.

58:35.334 --> 58:37.153
Everyone was cheering him on.

58:38.601 --> 58:40.802
I was scared, you know?

58:41.701 --> 58:43.769
His feet, they were burning.

58:44.768 --> 58:47.176
So I pulled him off, and he punched me.

58:48.568 --> 58:50.969
Which was fucking out of order, you know?

58:51.368 --> 58:54.349
So I tell him to fuck off,
and he turns to me, and he says...

58:54.449 --> 58:56.286
"Let's have a drink."

58:57.635 --> 59:00.886
He chases me through the courtyard. He's...

59:02.568 --> 59:06.220
...screaming like Superman.

59:07.835 --> 59:12.485
We come in here, and...
he makes us drink something foul.

59:15.068 --> 59:17.122
And he says he's got something to show me...

59:18.001 --> 59:21.007
...his new plan... his new new plan.

59:21.835 --> 59:23.902
We've had a few plans already.

59:25.201 --> 59:28.090
So I'm a bit fucking fed up
with his plans, but, you know...

59:30.401 --> 59:32.253
...it's Harry.

59:33.401 --> 59:35.285
He's my best friend.

59:38.902 --> 59:40.720
So I take a look...

59:42.401 --> 59:44.202
...in the kitchen.

59:44.801 --> 59:48.453
He's got this gleam in his eye,
like, "This is it. This is everything."

59:52.568 --> 59:54.569
He wants to burn the house down.

59:55.468 --> 59:57.669
He says, "If we do it tonight,
we can say we didn't know...

59:57.769 --> 01:00:00.102
...and it might have been the party, and...

01:00:00.202 --> 01:00:04.020
...we'll get the insurance from the house
and all the money problems will be over."

01:00:08.334 --> 01:00:10.364
He was out of his fucking mind.

01:00:12.534 --> 01:00:16.634
Told him no way. I told him,
it'd never work and he'd get locked up.

01:00:16.734 --> 01:00:21.619
Told him we probably should get locked up,
and he grabbed my face, and he spat at me.

01:00:26.135 --> 01:00:29.135
I took the matches from him,
and I told him that was it...

01:00:29.234 --> 01:00:31.053
...he was on his own.

01:00:33.902 --> 01:00:35.903
He yelled something at me.

01:00:37.202 --> 01:00:39.020
I can't remember now.

01:00:50.234 --> 01:00:52.069
And then what?

01:00:52.468 --> 01:00:54.285
I don't know.

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:57.602
I saw him talking to Aubrey,
and then he disappeared.

01:00:57.702 --> 01:00:59.552
To Aubrey?

01:01:00.569 --> 01:01:02.568
What was he talking about?

01:01:02.668 --> 01:01:07.046
I couldn't hear. Aubrey was
giving him an earful as usual.

01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.024
Then I heard a bang.

01:01:21.635 --> 01:01:23.335
You found him?

01:01:36.268 --> 01:01:38.920
So Aubrey was the last person to talk to him.

01:01:51.819 --> 01:01:53.719
Wasn't your fault, James.

01:01:56.635 --> 01:01:58.152
What?

01:02:00.234 --> 01:02:01.886
Don't blame yourself.

01:02:12.535 --> 01:02:14.272
Fuck you.

01:02:21.268 --> 01:02:24.302
That would be marvelous. Thank you.

01:02:24.702 --> 01:02:26.769
Yes. Uh...

01:02:27.268 --> 01:02:31.069
...11:00 Friday, All Saints church.

01:02:31.168 --> 01:02:32.569
Yeah.

01:02:32.669 --> 01:02:34.552
Thank you, Bridget.

01:02:36.501 --> 01:02:39.368
James says you were
talking to Harry at the party.

01:02:39.468 --> 01:02:42.519
- What?
- Before he shot himself.

01:02:43.434 --> 01:02:46.453
James says you were talking to Harry,
and then he shot himself.

01:02:48.569 --> 01:02:52.225
- What did you say?
- For God's sake, Clover.

01:02:52.835 --> 01:02:55.601
We were talking all night. It was a party.

01:02:55.701 --> 01:02:59.560
So you can't remember the last thing you
said to your son before he killed himself?

01:03:07.168 --> 01:03:09.253
I don't want this to be your fault!

01:03:18.652 --> 01:03:22.270
We are not just gonna sit here
and pretend that this didn't happen...

01:03:23.501 --> 01:03:26.753
...that it's okay not to talk
about it, not again.

01:03:35.168 --> 01:03:38.736
Or maybe you can just put your family in
the ground one by one and not give a shit.

01:03:38.836 --> 01:03:40.402
Get out.

01:03:41.002 --> 01:03:44.814
Get out now! Get the hell out!

01:07:15.301 --> 01:07:16.602
Hello. Can I help you?

01:07:16.702 --> 01:07:20.169
Hello, my love. Animal Health,
here to collect the animals.

01:07:20.769 --> 01:07:23.458
- Oh! I can just take you to them.
- Got all the details here...

01:07:23.558 --> 01:07:26.902
- ...list of all the reactives.
- What?

01:07:27.002 --> 01:07:29.868
Oh, the infected cattle,
the one's we're collecting.

01:07:29.968 --> 01:07:32.535
- The cattle?
- Yes, my love.

01:07:32.635 --> 01:07:36.837
- I thought you were here for the badgers.
- Badgers? What badgers?

01:07:43.369 --> 01:07:45.168
They have T.B.?

01:07:45.268 --> 01:07:47.526
Is there someone in charge around here?

01:08:06.934 --> 01:08:08.818
What happened?

01:08:09.402 --> 01:08:12.400
Apparently they sent the results
last week to Harry.

01:08:12.868 --> 01:08:15.094
See why he canceled the sale.

01:08:15.934 --> 01:08:17.740
Why didn't he tell you?

01:08:21.968 --> 01:08:25.430
I better call Roger, tell him it's all over.

01:09:17.102 --> 01:09:18.685
Aubrey.

01:09:26.669 --> 01:09:28.185
Aubrey?

01:09:29.104 --> 01:09:32.001
Milo. Where's Aubrey, Milo?

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.924
Where is he?

01:09:59.535 --> 01:10:01.420
Good boy, Milo.

01:10:27.469 --> 01:10:29.694
<i>And you will pass my number on to James?</i>

01:10:32.302 --> 01:10:34.085
It would just, uh...

01:10:34.902 --> 01:10:37.769
...it would really just be great
just to talk to him...

01:10:37.869 --> 01:10:39.685
...before tomorrow.

01:10:40.701 --> 01:10:42.581
He is coming tomorrow, isn't he?

01:10:44.735 --> 01:10:46.303
Okay.

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:49.403
Thanks, Sheila. Okay.

01:10:50.402 --> 01:10:51.969
Bye.

01:12:00.185 --> 01:12:01.685
Morning.

01:12:03.034 --> 01:12:05.685
Do you have a shirt
or anything you need ironed?

01:12:15.718 --> 01:12:17.569
Where have you been?

01:12:19.185 --> 01:12:21.002
I was just in bed.

01:12:22.405 --> 01:12:24.249
We needed you.

01:12:24.935 --> 01:12:26.953
We needed you here.

01:12:31.402 --> 01:12:33.220
I know.

01:12:36.568 --> 01:12:38.585
Why didn't you come?

01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:45.920
I'm sorry.

01:12:49.469 --> 01:12:51.353
I'm so sorry.

01:12:58.302 --> 01:13:01.569
He should've told me. He should've
told me he needed me. I asked him.

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:04.644
You knew how soft he was.
You knew he couldn't cope.

01:13:04.744 --> 01:13:07.369
You don't wait for him to ask.

01:13:07.468 --> 01:13:11.502
- I know.
- He shouldn't have to call you.

01:13:12.102 --> 01:13:15.303
He shouldn't have to ask me to call you.

01:13:16.601 --> 01:13:18.469
For Christ's sake.

01:13:19.369 --> 01:13:22.220
- What?
- I trusted him!

01:13:23.802 --> 01:13:26.902
I gave him the farm.
He promised me he could cope.

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:31.069
- What are you talking about?
- He needs you to come home.

01:13:31.169 --> 01:13:34.969
What the hell am I supposed to say?
"Oh, yes, of course you can.

01:13:35.069 --> 01:13:39.369
You just go running to Clover.
She'll get you out of it."

01:13:39.468 --> 01:13:41.169
No, I bloody didn't.

01:13:41.269 --> 01:13:44.069
"Don't you dare," I said. "Don't you dare."

01:13:44.169 --> 01:13:46.669
You knuckle down, and you deal with it.

01:13:46.769 --> 01:13:50.169
"This is your farm now. This is your life.

01:13:50.269 --> 01:13:54.086
You bloody better get on with it,
or what use are you?"

01:13:59.434 --> 01:14:00.947
When...

01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:03.197
...when did he want to call me?

01:14:05.035 --> 01:14:06.635
During the party?

01:14:07.434 --> 01:14:11.659
It's a bloody ridiculous time
to call someone!

01:14:26.769 --> 01:14:28.652
I'll get that.

01:14:32.069 --> 01:14:34.992
- Morning.
- Morning, love. You ready?

01:14:35.092 --> 01:14:36.469
Just getting ready now.

01:14:36.569 --> 01:14:39.634
- How's Aubrey holding up?
- He's fine.

01:14:39.734 --> 01:14:42.369
I don't know what you have for clothes
but it's supposed to rain today...

01:14:42.469 --> 01:14:45.102
...and I thought you might like
something smart for the church.

01:14:45.202 --> 01:14:46.701
Thank you. That's so kind.

01:14:46.801 --> 01:14:49.332
And I just wanted you
to take a look at the flowers.

01:14:49.431 --> 01:14:52.035
We've all pitched in,
but I wanted you to be sure...

01:14:52.135 --> 01:14:55.018
- ...that they were what he would've wanted.
- I'm sure they're perfect.

01:14:55.118 --> 01:14:57.186
Will you come and have a look?

01:14:58.601 --> 01:15:00.419
Yeah, of course.

01:15:08.235 --> 01:15:11.123
- They're lovely. Thanks, Helen.
- Are you sure?

01:15:11.223 --> 01:15:15.202
'Cause briony put some yellow in hers
and I'm not sure what you felt about yellow.

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:17.502
I didn't want them to look weddingy.

01:15:17.902 --> 01:15:21.572
- Where are you going?
- Just gotta get something from the house.

01:15:21.672 --> 01:15:25.835
- Morning, Helen. Lovely flowers.
- Morning, Aubrey.

01:15:25.935 --> 01:15:28.735
You better get back. Thank you, Helen.
We'll be over in a minute.

01:15:28.835 --> 01:15:32.254
Lovely. You go and get ready,
and I'll see you there.

01:16:28.002 --> 01:16:29.568
Daddy!

01:16:53.268 --> 01:16:54.786
Daddy.

01:16:56.268 --> 01:16:57.820
Daddy!

01:16:58.935 --> 01:17:00.335
Daddy!

01:17:17.069 --> 01:17:19.535
Daddy! No, Daddy! Stop!

01:17:20.234 --> 01:17:21.752
Stop!

01:17:23.102 --> 01:17:24.685
Stop.

01:17:28.534 --> 01:17:30.385
Just stop.

01:17:32.502 --> 01:17:34.301
No more. No more.

01:17:34.401 --> 01:17:37.419
- It's over.
- No.

01:17:38.639 --> 01:17:40.432
Stop. No more.

01:17:40.902 --> 01:17:42.787
Daddy, please.

01:17:46.002 --> 01:17:47.802
Just go.

01:17:48.201 --> 01:17:51.035
Go! Go! Go live your life!

01:17:51.135 --> 01:17:53.022
I don't want to go.

01:17:57.169 --> 01:17:58.719
I...

01:18:00.869 --> 01:18:02.719
I want to stay here.

01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:19.719
You want me to go?

01:18:21.952 --> 01:18:24.223
There's nothing left for you here.

01:18:30.569 --> 01:18:32.452
You're here.

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:36.769
You're here.

01:18:45.802 --> 01:18:47.619
Give me the gun.
