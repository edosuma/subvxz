WEBVTT

00:12.595 --> 00:18.101
(hissing)

00:18.184 --> 00:19.602
What are you doing?

00:19.686 --> 00:20.979
Sometimes I hum
warp engine sounds

00:21.062 --> 00:22.647
just to, you know,
soothe myself.

00:22.731 --> 00:24.441
Well, that is not what
the engine sounds like.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.443
Duh. That was Enterprise-D
at warp 4.

00:26.526 --> 00:27.944
This is Cerritos.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.904
(whooshing in different pitch)

00:29.988 --> 00:31.406
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I get it.

00:31.489 --> 00:33.616
It's like...
(making whooshing sounds)

00:33.700 --> 00:36.453
Fletcher, no. The Cerritos has
inverted plasma distributors,

00:36.536 --> 00:37.996
so it's a little bit
higher pitch, like...

00:38.079 --> 00:39.247
(higher-pitched whooshing)

00:39.330 --> 00:42.459
Wrong. The shhz doesn't come
from the distributors.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.627
It's the vibrations in the
dilithium dispersement manifold.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.962
It's like this.
Fzzzzz...

00:46.045 --> 00:47.630
No, guys, guys, it's like this.
Shhh...

00:47.714 --> 00:49.632
Dude, I'm telling you,
it's Fzzz...

00:49.716 --> 00:51.426
And Voyager was all...
jzzz...

00:51.509 --> 00:53.303
(gasps)
Are we doing the engine sounds?

00:53.386 --> 00:54.304
Hchhhh...

00:54.387 --> 00:56.848
(chant-like resonance)

00:56.931 --> 00:58.475
Security to Deck 11.

00:58.558 --> 00:59.976
Something is very wrong
down here.

01:00.059 --> 01:01.770
On the ground, now!

01:01.853 --> 01:02.979
-Ah!
-We're just humming the...
-I said freeze!

01:03.062 --> 01:04.439
(cries out)

01:04.522 --> 01:06.983
Oh, it is a little higher.

01:07.066 --> 01:09.110

01:26.586 --> 01:28.630

SHAXS:
Security log, stardate 57663.9.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.852
Our standoff with Drookmani
scavengers continues.

02:23.935 --> 02:27.397
Their claim of salvage on
Starfleet cargo is ludicrous.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.900
Thus far, my recommendation of
full assault has been ignored

02:30.984 --> 02:32.068
in favor of a more...

02:32.151 --> 02:34.112
diplomatic approach.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.072
As I've already said, Captain,

02:36.155 --> 02:39.075
while we appreciate your
discovery of this cargo,

02:39.158 --> 02:41.411
we can only offer you
a finder's reward.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.872
This trash is ours.
We claim salvage.

02:43.955 --> 02:44.956
It has "Starfleet"
stamped on it.

02:45.039 --> 02:45.999
That's our trash.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.458
It's been abandoned

02:47.542 --> 02:48.960
for more than 100 years!

02:49.043 --> 02:50.920
That means it's clear
for salvage.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.505
We're taking it!

02:54.507 --> 02:56.593
BARNES: Captain, they're
attempting to load that cargo

02:56.676 --> 02:58.428
-with their tractor beam.
-Oh, no, they didn't.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.637
Engage our tractor beam.

03:05.226 --> 03:08.104
Those crates are brimming with
unique Starfleet technology.

03:08.187 --> 03:09.606
We can't let them have it.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.733
If we fire on them,
it's an act of war.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.902
-I advise we fire on them.
-Shaxs!

03:13.985 --> 03:15.153
Shields up.
Yellow alert.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.196
Our goal is that
this doesn't turn violent.

03:17.280 --> 03:21.117
But if it does, our crew is
ready and focused.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.786
ALL (chanting):
Fletcher! Fletcher! Fletcher...

03:23.870 --> 03:25.705
That's like three cantaloupes
worth of purée.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.790
-He could beat the record!
-He's doing it!

03:27.874 --> 03:29.167
Come on, Fletcher,
sloupe that 'loupe!

03:29.250 --> 03:32.128
-Whoo-hoo! Ooh...
-Aah! (bleep)

03:32.211 --> 03:34.464
Do you know how hard it is
to get cheese out of fur

03:34.547 --> 03:35.924
in a sonic shower?!

03:36.007 --> 03:38.134
Oh, no, I am so, so sorry.
I didn't mean to.

03:38.217 --> 03:40.094
Don't try to butter
my bread, Ensign.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.638
I've heard about you.

03:41.721 --> 03:43.973
-But I didn't-- What?
-You're a disgrace.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.976
You want to goof around?
Go work on Starbase 80.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.978
-(all gasp)
-MALE: Damn. Starbase 80?

03:49.062 --> 03:51.773
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize
cats ate nachos.

03:51.856 --> 03:52.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.484
All right, all right, all right.
Here, Doc.

03:54.567 --> 03:55.985
-Here's a warm towel.
-Give me that!

03:56.069 --> 03:58.780
And some freshly replicated
nachos.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.532
Try the carnitas.
It's delicioso.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.035
At least someone around here
appreciates rank.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.912
-Mm...
-Don't listen to her.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.956
-She's just a cat in a coat.
-(exhales sharply)

04:08.039 --> 04:08.998
Thanks for defusing that,
Fletch.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.625
I was about to go nuts.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.543
Fletcher's like a natural
peace negotiator.

04:12.627 --> 04:13.753
He was always getting us
out of trouble

04:13.836 --> 04:14.545
back in the Academy.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.673
Ha. Remember when
those Nausicans

04:16.756 --> 04:18.174
tried to eat your heart?

04:18.257 --> 04:20.510
Yeah, until you convinced them
just to spit in my face.

04:20.593 --> 04:21.511
I was lucky you were there.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.680
Uh, Mariner, you were lucky
he was here, too.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.139
You know,
it's not very Starfleet

04:25.223 --> 04:26.641
to take a swing
at the bridge crew.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.643
(scoffs)
Whatever. I'm Starfleet as hell.

04:28.726 --> 04:30.019
And if somebody brings up
Starbase 80,

04:30.103 --> 04:31.521
they better be ready
to throw down.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.855
Hey, Mariner, don't let
the senior officers

04:32.939 --> 04:33.856
get in your head.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.858
You wouldn't be here
if you weren't great.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.527
'Cause there's a baseline
of goodness

04:37.610 --> 04:38.945
to everyone in Starfleet.

04:39.028 --> 04:40.530
Even Boimler.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.657
(laughter)

04:42.740 --> 04:46.202
So, um, what do you think's
in that cargo

04:46.286 --> 04:47.745
that has everyone so wound up?

04:47.829 --> 04:49.163
A bunch of cryo-frozen
princesses

04:49.247 --> 04:50.540
or maybe some fruit?

04:50.623 --> 04:52.041
Ooh, I hope it's
old communicators.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.543
You know, the original
clamshell design.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.044
Ah! Do you think
we're going to find out?

04:55.128 --> 04:56.879
Once they figure things out
with those aliens,

04:56.963 --> 04:58.881
they'll probably us space walk
to get everything cataloged.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.550
Uh, space walk? Really?

05:00.633 --> 05:02.552
W-Why can't we just use
the cargo transporter?

05:02.635 --> 05:03.803
-That stuff's too massive.
-Ah...

05:03.886 --> 05:06.222
Wait, what's wrong? I thought
you loved archival cataloging.

05:06.305 --> 05:07.724
You talk about it
all the time.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.726
I have a horrible secret.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.020
I never finished my space-walk
unit at the Academy.

05:12.103 --> 05:13.229
What? How did you graduate?

05:13.312 --> 05:14.689
I don't know.
He just gave me a "B,"

05:14.772 --> 05:15.898
and I didn't say anything.

05:15.982 --> 05:16.899
It must have been
a clerical error.

05:16.983 --> 05:19.277
I'm a monster.
Why didn't I just confess?!

05:19.360 --> 05:21.070
Spacewalking is easy.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.906
You just float and magnet.
Float and magnet.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.575
But what if I forget to magnet?!

05:25.658 --> 05:26.951
I'll spin out into
the void of space

05:27.035 --> 05:29.037
and burn up in the atmosphere
of a gas giant.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.079
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Calm down.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.080
That's not gonna happen.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.082
Listen, I've been working on
this new holodeck

05:33.166 --> 05:34.083
training program.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.001
I think it can help you.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.919
-You want to try it out?
-Oh, my gosh, yes.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.213
Thank you. Thank you
so much, Rutherford. Ah!

05:39.297 --> 05:41.758
The holodeck. Gah, why didn't I
think of that sooner?

05:41.841 --> 05:43.760
Yeah, you know, it's not just
for hanging with Sherlock Holmes

05:43.843 --> 05:46.095
and Robin Hood and Sigmund Freud
and Cyrano de Bergerac

05:46.179 --> 05:47.722
and Einstein and da Vinci
and Stephen Hawking

05:47.805 --> 05:48.890
and Socrates...

05:48.973 --> 05:52.769
Oh, five isolinear
cores down and,

05:52.852 --> 05:54.312
ugh, just a ton more to go.

05:54.395 --> 05:57.106
You know, when you call
something a "core,"

05:57.190 --> 05:58.816
it implies there's going to be
one big one,

05:58.900 --> 06:00.318
not a million little ones.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.320
Ugh, we're not gonna make it
to the Chu Chu dance.

06:02.403 --> 06:04.322
I traded Kowalski 12 shifts
so I could go.

06:04.405 --> 06:05.948
Chu Chu dance?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.950
That sounds awesome.
Is it really that good?

06:08.034 --> 06:09.744
Oh, yeah.
I saw the Zebulon Sisters do it

06:09.827 --> 06:11.287
back on Deep Space 3,
and I am just now

06:11.370 --> 06:12.955
coming down from the high.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.040
-Chu Chu!
-Chu Chu.

06:14.123 --> 06:17.293
-Oh, great.
Everybody's going except us.
-Guys.

06:17.376 --> 06:18.795
I can handle this on my own.

06:18.878 --> 06:19.796
Go get your Chu Chu on.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.131
Oh, no, no, no, we would not
make you do that.

06:22.215 --> 06:24.300
You would do the same for me.
I've got this.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.010
Lower Deckers stick together.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.096
Fletcher,
that is super cool, man.

06:28.179 --> 06:29.931
Hell yeah. Thanks, Fletcher.

06:30.014 --> 06:30.973
Mariner, let's go get
our Chu Chu shirts.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.141
We have Chu Chu shirts?

06:32.225 --> 06:33.643
Yeah, I made us Chu Chu shirts,
come on.

06:33.726 --> 06:34.811
BOTH:
Chu Chu!

06:34.894 --> 06:37.814
(chuckles)
Ah, back to work.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.650
RUTHERFORD:
All right, don't you worry.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.360
My program will
have you spacewalking

06:42.443 --> 06:43.653
with the best of 'em.

06:43.736 --> 06:47.281
Computer, load Rutherford
Training Beta 2.5.

06:48.866 --> 06:49.826
Aah!

06:49.909 --> 06:51.661
Hi. Can I teach you a lesson?

06:51.744 --> 06:53.287
Aw. Well, who's this little guy?

06:53.371 --> 06:54.664
This is Badgey.

06:54.747 --> 06:56.374
He's a virtual tutor
who can walk you through

06:56.457 --> 06:59.001
any Starfleet exercise
you can imagine.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.336
Aw, look at his little arms.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.838
Yeah, I made him cute.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.132
Hi, Badgey, I'm Tendi.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.175
Hi. Can I teach you a lesson?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.718
Yes, um, can you show me
how to perform

07:07.802 --> 07:09.679
an untethered cargo retrieval
in open space?

07:09.762 --> 07:12.014
(trilling)

07:12.098 --> 07:14.350
Sometimes it takes a second.
(nervous chuckle)

07:14.433 --> 07:16.477
You got it.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.690
Wow, you coded this yourself?

07:20.773 --> 07:21.732
Yeah, it's just a hobby.

07:21.816 --> 07:24.026
-But the gravitational waves
were tricky.
-Ah!

07:24.110 --> 07:26.070
Oh, uh, uh...

07:26.154 --> 07:27.363
So this is spacewalking?

07:27.446 --> 07:28.698
(chuckles)
I like it.

07:28.781 --> 07:29.866
Just don't get your magnet boots
too close to...

07:29.949 --> 07:31.033
Oh!

07:31.117 --> 07:32.869
(both laughing)

07:32.952 --> 07:34.704
Oh, we're stuck together.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.080
I think we're stuck together.

07:36.164 --> 07:39.208
Oh, sorry. Yeah.
Let me just... (grunts)

07:39.292 --> 07:41.878
Looks like you want
to recover lost cargo.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.046
-Did I get that right?
-Oh, yeah. Almost forgot.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.214
Coming right up.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.549
(trilling)

07:48.801 --> 07:50.219
Wow, look at him--
Look at him try.

07:50.303 --> 07:51.888
Ugh, that shouldn't happen.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.765
Badgey, restart cargo recovery.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.018
Badgey, restart sequence!

07:57.101 --> 07:58.060
Sorry, it usually works.

07:58.144 --> 07:59.187
Badgey, stop it!

07:59.270 --> 08:00.396
Uh, no, it's-it's nothing,
really.

08:00.479 --> 08:02.106
Come on, you stupid glitch.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.360
We're back in business.
(laughs)

08:06.444 --> 08:09.906
(ominous music plays)

08:09.989 --> 08:12.408
I can't believe
I actually made eye contact

08:12.491 --> 08:14.410
with one of the Zebulon Sisters.

08:14.493 --> 08:16.245
Oh, God, I forgot
how to breathe.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.748
Oh, my God, and then,
when they added the third Chu,

08:18.831 --> 08:21.083
and they were doing
the Chu Chu Chu dance?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.126
They're geniuses.

08:22.210 --> 08:25.087
(chuckling) I'm glad we
did this together, Boims.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.298
Sometimes you can be, like,
really not annoying.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.467
Yeah. Sometimes you can be
not annoying, too.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.509
(Fletcher groans)

08:30.593 --> 08:31.761
Fletcher!

08:31.844 --> 08:34.764
-Oh, no, I'm so woozy.
-Are you okay?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.265
-What happened?
-Oh...

08:36.349 --> 08:39.477
The core.
I was working on the core.

08:39.560 --> 08:43.272
Everything was going fine,
until...

08:43.356 --> 08:45.942
(pained cry)

08:46.025 --> 08:48.444
I couldn't move.
I-I couldn't breathe.

08:48.527 --> 08:50.112
Fletcher, you tell me
who did this to you.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.447
Uh, I don't know.

08:51.530 --> 08:53.282
Next thing I knew,
you were here,

08:53.366 --> 08:54.992
and now I'm saying this.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.911
Guys, somebody made off with
one of the isolinear cores

08:56.994 --> 08:57.954
for the shield array

08:58.037 --> 08:59.497
Is that important?

08:59.580 --> 09:02.124
Kinda. They regulate auto-repair
when the shield's damaged.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.251
I messed up the shields?

09:03.334 --> 09:05.795
Hey, hey, it's okay.
It's like a backup of a backup.

09:05.878 --> 09:06.963
Seems like somebody wanted
to get you in trouble

09:07.046 --> 09:08.005
without damaging the ship.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.966
The next time the bridge
runs a shield diagnostic,

09:10.049 --> 09:11.300
they'll definitely notice
it's missing.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.803
(crying)
I'm gonna get court-martialed.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.137
No, you're not.
We can figure this out

09:15.221 --> 09:16.305
before anyone notices.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.306
We're the ones who
left you alone.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.350
We have to work together
to get that core back.

09:19.433 --> 09:21.269
Okay, who's shady as hell

09:21.352 --> 09:23.020
and knows this system
as well as we do?

09:23.104 --> 09:25.815
ALL:
Delta Shift.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.984
These creepy Delta Shift guys
have always

09:28.067 --> 09:29.151
rubbed me the wrong way.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.988
I mean, what, they do our jobs
while we sleep? So weird.

09:32.071 --> 09:32.989
KARAVITUS:
Check it out, guys.

09:33.072 --> 09:33.990
Beta Shifters.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.450
Shouldn't you guys be
getting ready for bed?

09:36.534 --> 09:38.995
(laughs)
Hey, which one of you jerks

09:39.078 --> 09:41.163
never bothers to wipe down
the diagnostic panel?

09:41.247 --> 09:42.456
Other people use that thing.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.166
-Um...
-Look, we don't want to be here.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.127
I don't like us being awake
at the same time.

09:46.210 --> 09:48.212
It feels wrong, okay?
But we need some answers.

09:48.296 --> 09:51.340
Oh, damn, this must be
the Beta Shift's version

09:51.424 --> 09:52.383
of a badass.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.051
Mariner's a total badass!

09:54.135 --> 09:55.553
And if you don't come clean,
she's gonna

09:55.636 --> 09:57.013
(bleep) your (bleep) off!

09:57.096 --> 09:59.223
Whoa, Fletcher, ease up, man.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.516
Guys, I'm not gonna do that.
I'm so sorry.

10:00.599 --> 10:02.184
Just give us the core,
we'll go,

10:02.268 --> 10:04.270
-and this can all be over.
-What core?

10:04.353 --> 10:07.023
Oh, please. Puh-lease!

10:07.106 --> 10:09.066
Look, someone knocked
Fletcher out

10:09.150 --> 10:10.609
and stole an isolinear core.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.361
Are you accusing us of assault?

10:12.445 --> 10:13.237
Get out of here!

10:13.321 --> 10:15.031
We don't know anything
about a core.

10:15.114 --> 10:16.866
That's it.
You want some of this?

10:16.949 --> 10:18.075
Where's the core?
Where's the core?

10:18.159 --> 10:19.076
-Where's the core, dude?
Where's the core?
-Guys, no, no.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.536
-Don't undo your flaps.
-Do you want to dance?

10:20.620 --> 10:22.163
I'll take you to the dance.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.081
I'll pick you up
at your mom and dad's house.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.374
You don't talk about my dad!

10:25.458 --> 10:27.209
Wait, hold on.
When did this all go down?

10:27.293 --> 10:29.045
Uh, I don't know.
A few hours ago.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.547
What? We were at
the Chu Chu dance with you.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.883
Oh, yeah.
(laughs)

10:33.966 --> 10:35.551
-Oh!
-Chu Chu-- Chu Chu dance.

10:35.634 --> 10:36.886
Wow. A double dance.
Chu Chu dance.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.429
Oh, my God, Chu Chu dance.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.556
And at the end,
when they added the third Chu

10:40.639 --> 10:42.224
and it became
the Chu Chu Chu dance,

10:42.308 --> 10:44.393
I cried. I saw you crying, too.
Don't even lie.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.103
Oh, damn, you were there.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.564
Yeah, that checks out.
It had to be someone else, man.

10:48.647 --> 10:49.899
Don't you remember anything?

10:49.982 --> 10:51.400
I don't know. It was dark.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.277
It was totally dark.
Couldn't see anything.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.278
-(loud bang)
-ALL: Whoa!

10:54.362 --> 10:56.405
Did they just fire on us?

10:56.489 --> 10:58.407
Impossible. These guys
don't even have weapons.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.242
The Drookmani have reversed
their tractor beam

11:00.326 --> 11:02.995
to launch the cargo
against our hull.

11:04.038 --> 11:07.375
These guys are lucky
I'm so ethical and considerate.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.710
(laughing maniacally)

11:17.009 --> 11:18.594
Captain, something is wrong
with our shields.

11:18.677 --> 11:20.096
They shouldn't be fading
this fast.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.430
Permission to destroy
the enemy ship.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.140
They're trying to bait us
into a fight.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.434
We have to find a way
to end this peacefully.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.353
We're Starfleet, damn it.

11:30.648 --> 11:32.983
(electricity crackling)

11:33.067 --> 11:33.984
-Whoa!
-What? Aah!

11:34.068 --> 11:36.112
COMPUTER:
Non-essential power diverted.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.613
Safety protocols disabled.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.073
What the heck?

11:39.156 --> 11:40.616
Uh, we should get out of here.
Computer, end program.

11:40.699 --> 11:43.411
-(electronic chime)
-I said computer, end program.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.620
-(electronic chime)
-That's not good.

11:44.703 --> 11:45.955
Badgey, run diagnostic.

11:46.038 --> 11:47.456
You got it.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.457
Ow!

11:48.541 --> 11:50.292
Sorry about that.

11:50.376 --> 11:54.130
I didn't mean to hurt you.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.256
Badgey, what the hell?

11:55.339 --> 11:58.676
Oh, guess I'm just
a stupid, worthless glitch!

11:58.759 --> 11:59.969
Oh. Badgey?

12:00.052 --> 12:01.470
Computer, re-engage
safety protocols.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.097
COMPUTER:
Safety protocols are
unavailable.

12:03.180 --> 12:05.099
(roars)

12:05.182 --> 12:06.684
-(cries out)
-(screams)

12:06.767 --> 12:08.227
Get off me.
He's corrupted!

12:09.603 --> 12:12.523
Can I teach you a lesson?

12:12.606 --> 12:16.652
(Badgey laughing)

12:17.486 --> 12:20.614
Computer,
load Bajoran marketplace!

12:22.575 --> 12:24.410
Put this on, put this on.
We got to blend in.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.539
(people screaming)

12:29.748 --> 12:31.667
We got to keep going.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.002
-(male screaming)
-Fun fact,

12:33.085 --> 12:35.004
I'm gonna rip your eyes out!

12:35.087 --> 12:36.630
That fact wasn't fun!

12:36.714 --> 12:38.257
(laughs)

12:50.436 --> 12:52.855
Our shields can't take
much more of this.

12:52.938 --> 12:54.106
These guys are begging
for a fight.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.691
I say we give it to 'em.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.359
Phasers locked
onto their warp core, Captain.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.653
Please, please let me
shoot their warp core.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.030
I have been very good
this month.

13:01.113 --> 13:04.158
-Evasive pattern Sulu-Alpha.
-Oh, come on!

13:04.241 --> 13:07.912
I thought you said this trash
wasn't worth fighting for.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.121
We're not fighting.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.915
Avoiding damage is fighting.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.167
(groans)
We can talk this out.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.418
(bleep) you.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.381
(shouting)

13:19.465 --> 13:21.717
Oh, man, the shields
must be slammed.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.178
If they fall below 50%,
they'll realize the core's gone.

13:24.261 --> 13:25.721
-And then I'll be gone.
-Wait, wait, wait.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.014
I thought Drookmani
were just scavengers.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.308
The Drookmani!
I bet they took the core,

13:29.391 --> 13:30.976
to mess with our defenses.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.394
The guy who zapped me
was definitely an alien.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.896
We got to report this
to the bridge.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.898
Whoa, hold up. We got to scan
the ship for intruders,

13:35.981 --> 13:37.358
I'm not going to the captain
without proof.

13:37.441 --> 13:40.194
Okay, let's go.
Let's go get our scanners.

13:40.277 --> 13:41.695
Okay, listen.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.030
I'll search decks
two through ten.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.074
Fletcher, you-- the... Huh?

13:45.157 --> 13:48.244
The core?
Fletcher, it was in your bunk?

13:48.327 --> 13:50.955
Uh, uh, aliens.
It's, uh, aliens.

13:51.038 --> 13:53.249
Those frickin' aliens,
I knew they'd do this.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.708
They're gonna frame me.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.210
-I knew it.
-Fletcher.

13:56.293 --> 13:59.255
(grunts)
I messed up, you guys.

13:59.338 --> 14:01.090
Oh, man, I really messed up.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.800
-I'm the worst! I'm slime!
-Stop it!

14:02.883 --> 14:05.094
-Get ahold of yourself
and shut up.
-Stupid, stupid Fletcher!

14:05.177 --> 14:07.179
Just tell us what you did.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.265
When you guys went
to the Chu Chu dance,

14:09.348 --> 14:12.101
I was doing all that
rewiring on my own,

14:12.184 --> 14:15.396
and it was getting so hard,
so, I was like,

14:15.479 --> 14:18.232
"This would be so much easier
if I were smarter."

14:18.315 --> 14:20.776
And then I was like,
"Wait. The computer's smart.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.279
-Maybe it can make me smart."
-What?

14:23.362 --> 14:25.281
FLETCHER:
So I hooked it up
directly to my brain,

14:25.364 --> 14:27.157
and let it run
so it would make me smarter.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.326
MARINER:
Ooh, boy,
that is not a good idea.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.453
COMPUTER:
Neural pathway established.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.122
(Fletcher shouting)

14:36.000 --> 14:37.251
FLETCHER:
But I didn't get smarter.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.253
It broke and I peed my pants.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.963
So I hid down here
and told you guys

14:41.046 --> 14:42.923
I had been attacked
so you wouldn't feel let down.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.092
Yeah, I don't kn-- uh, I don't
know what to do with this.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.303
We're supposed to have each
other's backs, Fletcher!

14:47.386 --> 14:49.805
You were gonna lie to the
captain about an alien attack?

14:49.888 --> 14:51.098
You could have started a war.

14:51.181 --> 14:52.766
Come on, just back me up.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.977
All we do is back you up,
and all you do is lie!

14:55.060 --> 14:57.354
I just wanted you
to be proud of me.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.773
-I messed up.
-(exhales)

14:59.857 --> 15:01.775
It's-- ugh-- it's okay.

15:01.859 --> 15:03.986
We can reformat the core
and put this all behind us.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.988
-I guess.
-Really?

15:06.071 --> 15:08.157
Oh, thanks, you guys.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.159
You know, I've actually
learned a lot today.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.328
This has been, like,
a learning experience for me.

15:12.411 --> 15:14.163
That's all that matters.
And you know what?

15:14.246 --> 15:17.207
We're Starfleet.
We are Starfleet.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.252
-And when we make
mistakes, we learn...
-(shouts)

15:28.636 --> 15:29.845
Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!

15:29.928 --> 15:32.181
-What did you do to it?
-I don't know!

15:32.264 --> 15:34.558
CORE (Fletcher voice):
Make me smarter.
Make me smarter.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.226
Ugh, Fletcher, your brain waves
corrupted that thing.

15:36.310 --> 15:39.146
It's incorporating anything
it can get its grabber on.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.899
-Fletcher, you've got
to call this in!
-But I'll get in trouble!

15:41.982 --> 15:44.568
-If this thing gets loose
it could mess up the ship.
-CORE: Show me something!

15:44.652 --> 15:46.070
Alert the captain right now!

15:46.153 --> 15:48.822
You're right. Just let me
get my tricorder here--

15:48.906 --> 15:52.034
Hello! Die! Die! Die!

15:52.117 --> 15:54.578
-Fletcher!
-CORE: Dummy!

15:54.662 --> 15:57.706
Dummy! Party of dumbass!

15:57.790 --> 16:00.334
-Me smart.
-Get off of me! Let go!

16:00.417 --> 16:03.712
You help me or I'll say
this was all your idea.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.089
I'm not going down for this.

16:05.172 --> 16:07.966
Dude, what you're doing
is so not Starfleet.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.218
You break rules all the time.

16:09.301 --> 16:10.844
Only dumb rules
that shouldn't be there

16:10.928 --> 16:12.221
so I can do a better job.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.764
I would never
put anyone in danger.

16:13.847 --> 16:16.100
-(clears throat)
-Except sometimes maybe Boimler.

16:16.183 --> 16:18.852
-(both shout)
-Stupid, stupid Fletcher!

16:20.187 --> 16:21.814
(all screaming)

16:21.897 --> 16:24.066
(panting, grunting)

16:25.025 --> 16:26.402
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.986
Here's a tip.

16:28.070 --> 16:33.242
I'm going to burn
your hearts in a fire!

16:33.325 --> 16:35.619
-Leave us alone, Badgey!
-No!

16:35.703 --> 16:38.956
-You were only trying to help.
-No, I was trying to show off.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.208
I knew Badgey wasn't ready yet,
but I wanted to impress you.

16:41.291 --> 16:44.044
I just think you're really cool.
I'm an idiot.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.755
Aw, Rutherford,
you impress me every day.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.257
You're very scientific.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.259
I mean, Badgey's
an amazing piece of programming,

16:50.342 --> 16:53.053
-even if he does
want to kill us.
-Yeah. (laughs)

16:53.137 --> 16:54.930
he is a killing machine,
isn't he?

16:55.013 --> 16:57.391
It's actually weird
that he hasn't murdered us yet.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.268
(panting)
Hope you're ready to die.

16:59.351 --> 17:03.897
Just as soon as I...
get up there...

17:03.981 --> 17:06.150
gonna kill you.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.735
Aw. Poor little guy's
really having trouble

17:07.818 --> 17:09.111
with those stairs.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.697
You've got this, Badgey!
Wait, what am I doing?

17:11.780 --> 17:12.948
He shouldn't be affected
by the physical parameters

17:13.031 --> 17:14.241
of the simulation.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.910
I'm gonna wear your skin!
(blabbers)

17:16.994 --> 17:18.412
Wait, if we're tiring him out,

17:18.495 --> 17:20.289
then maybe we can
freeze him out.

17:20.372 --> 17:23.792
Computer, load environment 83.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.169
(panting)

17:25.252 --> 17:27.796
(grunts)
Quick. Come on.

17:28.964 --> 17:30.340
Shield integrity 40%
and dropping.

17:30.424 --> 17:33.177
Automatic repair is down,
switching to manual.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.304
CORE:
Dummy! Dummy!

17:36.930 --> 17:38.390
Quick. Grab that edge,
we got to drag it...

17:38.474 --> 17:40.267
Guys, wait. I know what to do.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.685
You figured out how to fix it?

17:41.769 --> 17:42.853
I wish. No.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.730
We let this thing
beat us up a little,

17:44.813 --> 17:46.148
then later we say
that a Q showed up

17:46.231 --> 17:47.816
and caused all of this.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.985
Nobody will doubt us
'cause we'll be all busted up

17:50.068 --> 17:51.820
and, you know,
Qs are super unpredictable.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.155
Here, help me feed some stuff

17:53.238 --> 17:54.323
into this thing
so it gets bigger.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.200
CORE:
Delicioso.

17:56.283 --> 17:59.328
Oh, real nice, guys.
Let me out of here! Come on!

17:59.411 --> 18:01.371
-The Q thing's a good idea!
-CORE: Let go!

18:03.081 --> 18:05.042
Uh, it just incorporated
a light panel.

18:05.125 --> 18:06.210
We've got to get it
to the transporter

18:06.293 --> 18:07.711
before it's too big to move.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.213
I know you guys were friends
at the Academy,

18:09.296 --> 18:11.465
but I am just gonna say it:
I do not like Fletcher.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.467
-(Core laughs)
-Ow! We got to rethink
this whole

18:13.550 --> 18:15.177
"Lower Decks stands together"
thing.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.137
-CORE: What you got?
-You know, it's kind of nice

18:17.221 --> 18:18.722
that we aren't
fighting for once.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.140
Yeah. I guess we make
a good team.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.391
-CORE: What you got?
-From now on,

18:21.475 --> 18:23.018
some Lower Deckers
stand together.

18:23.101 --> 18:24.019
CORE:
Come on, bro, square up.

18:24.102 --> 18:26.063
Whoa! Oh, no.

18:26.146 --> 18:28.232
(Core screams)

18:28.315 --> 18:29.483
Oh, (bleep), there's no way

18:29.566 --> 18:31.276
we're gonna make it
to the transporter.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.361
(gasps)
Airlock.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.029
Aliens. It's, uh, aliens.

18:34.112 --> 18:35.280
Those frickin aliens!

18:35.364 --> 18:36.907
Here. Fetch!

18:36.990 --> 18:39.159
CORE:
Whoa! I got this.

18:40.869 --> 18:43.038
You don't talk about my dad!

18:43.121 --> 18:44.748
BOIMLER:
Whew.

18:44.832 --> 18:48.210
-Oh, that was close.
-Ooh, yeah. Disaster averted.

18:48.293 --> 18:51.547
MARINER:
Wait, wait. Is it drifting
towards the Drookmani?

18:51.630 --> 18:54.049
BOTH:
No, no, no, no...

18:55.634 --> 18:57.553
BOIMLER:
Oh, no.

18:57.636 --> 18:59.930
We are so getting fired
for this.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.393
Shields are down, Captain.

19:04.476 --> 19:08.188
I have done everything I can to
respect their sanctity of life,

19:08.272 --> 19:11.275
to avoid conflict, and give them
the benefit of the doubt.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.819
The Drookmani
have given me no choice.

19:13.902 --> 19:15.445
Shaxs, target their warp core.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.906
Yes!

19:17.990 --> 19:20.117
No! We waited too long.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.077
Weapons systems are down.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.246
We need to get the crew
into escape pods now.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.581
Prepare to abandon ship.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.332
Wait, Captain. Look.
What is that?

19:34.548 --> 19:37.467
-Uh...
-We did it!

19:37.551 --> 19:40.304
I don't know what we did,
but we did it!

19:40.387 --> 19:42.097
(laughs)

19:42.180 --> 19:44.975
Stay awake, Tendi.
We can do this.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.519
Did... did we lose him?

19:47.603 --> 19:49.605
(panting)

19:51.023 --> 19:52.608
Uh, yeah. We're doing fine.

19:52.691 --> 19:55.152
We're so good. Keep going.

19:55.235 --> 19:58.071
Ah. Not running anymore, Father?

19:58.155 --> 19:59.573
This ends now, Badgey.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.575
After I gut you, I'm gonna slit

20:01.658 --> 20:03.452
your little green friend's
throat

20:03.535 --> 20:05.954
and take a bath in her blood.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.956
No, you're not!
(shouts)

20:20.052 --> 20:22.471
I'm gonna wear your skin!

20:29.937 --> 20:32.481
(thunder crashes)

20:35.525 --> 20:37.319
(laughs)

20:37.402 --> 20:39.613
You can't hurt me, Father.

20:41.949 --> 20:47.037
Maybe with your disappointment,
but not with your fists.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.247
I'm sorry I yelled at you, son.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.166
I was just trying
to impress Tendi.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.335
I mean, look at her.
She's so cute.

20:53.418 --> 20:56.046
It's too late for apologies.

20:56.129 --> 20:58.507
It's too...

20:58.590 --> 21:00.968
Kill you...

21:01.051 --> 21:03.178
So cold. Father?

21:03.261 --> 21:05.180
(ragged exhale)

21:05.263 --> 21:07.391
I'm so sorry
it came to this, Badgey.

21:07.474 --> 21:08.892
I'm gonna cut off your foot.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.436
(shushes)
No. Don't talk.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.399
-It's over now.
-Diplomatic immunity.

21:17.317 --> 21:21.321
(crying):
Badgey!

21:23.782 --> 21:26.118
Got it. Restoring main power.

21:26.201 --> 21:29.079
COMPUTER:
Safety protocols restored.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.539
(grunts)

21:30.622 --> 21:32.290
Hi. Can I teach you a lesson?

21:32.374 --> 21:34.084
-Oh, hey. Hi, Badgey.
-Um...

21:34.167 --> 21:36.920
Um, does he remember
he was trying to, uh...

21:37.004 --> 21:39.172
Remember what?
Can I teach you a lesson?

21:39.256 --> 21:40.924
Nope, nope, nope, nope.
Actually, you know what?

21:41.008 --> 21:42.509
-We were just heading out.
-Yeah, yeah, we're-we're good.

21:42.592 --> 21:44.052
Thanks, Badgey.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.556
You got it. If you need me,
Badgey's here.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.933
I'm always here.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.185
Ow, my frickin' wrists
are all chafed.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.562
Good. Shut up.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.564
That core had my brain pattern
all over it.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.566
If they find it
and kick me off the ship,

21:57.649 --> 21:59.067
you're going down with me.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.444
What the hell is going on
down here?

22:00.527 --> 22:02.404
We've got an unauthorized
airlock ejection,

22:02.487 --> 22:04.364
a missing computer core,
and somebody attacked

22:04.448 --> 22:06.033
that Drookmani ship.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.118
You three better have one hell
of an explanation.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.746
Oh, I'll tell you
exactly what happened.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.040
SHAXS:
Ensign Fletcher's

22:13.123 --> 22:15.042
brilliant improvisation,

22:15.125 --> 22:17.294
updating the isolinear core
to weaponize it

22:17.377 --> 22:19.421
against the Drookmani
saved the Cerritos.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.965
Fletcher demonstrated
the sort of selfless heroism

22:22.049 --> 22:23.633
that Starfleet's all about.

22:23.717 --> 22:26.970
It's that heroism that
earned him a promotion

22:27.054 --> 22:29.973
and a transfer to the Titan!

22:30.057 --> 22:31.266
-(cheering, applause)
-FLETCHER: Oh, man.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.643
Wow.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.562
Did we have to get him promoted?

22:35.645 --> 22:37.272
Eh, you know what they say,
keep your friends close

22:37.355 --> 22:39.483
and your enemies
way the hell somewhere else.

22:39.566 --> 22:41.068
Whoa. The Titan.

22:41.151 --> 22:42.444
Isn't that, like,
your dream gig?

22:42.527 --> 22:44.321
Yeah. It is.
(sighs)

22:44.404 --> 22:46.281
But you know what, maybe this
is just what Fletcher needs

22:46.365 --> 22:47.407
to turn things around.

22:47.491 --> 22:49.284
New ship, new duties.

22:49.367 --> 22:51.453
It might just make him
a better man.

22:53.246 --> 22:54.998
I got frickin' fired!

22:55.082 --> 22:56.458
What? You, fired?

22:56.541 --> 22:58.627
Who would fire you, ever?

22:58.710 --> 23:00.587
It's like, who says you're not
supposed to empty trash

23:00.670 --> 23:02.756
into the warp core?
It all burns up anyway.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.008
Oh, yeah, who wouldn't make
that mistake?

23:05.092 --> 23:06.093
I thought maybe you guys
could, like, put in

23:06.176 --> 23:07.677
-a good word for me or...
-Uh, hey, Fletcher?

23:07.761 --> 23:09.596
Fletcher. Sorry,
you're breaking up.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.515
I think you're going through
a temporal rift or something.

23:11.598 --> 23:14.392
-A rift? What a-- Hello?
-Whoa, Fletcher, there's a Q.

23:14.476 --> 23:16.478
-I'm holding my badge up...
-There's a Q
doing crazy Q stuff.

23:16.561 --> 23:18.271
-Got to go.
-Can you hear me? Guys...

23:18.355 --> 23:20.148
Well, he's Earth's problem now.

23:20.232 --> 23:22.025
Got to say, I'd rather serve
with a dozen of you

23:22.109 --> 23:23.360
than one Fletcher.

23:23.443 --> 23:24.736
I mean, yeah, you break
the rules all the time,

23:24.820 --> 23:26.446
but at your heart,
you're Starfleet.

23:26.530 --> 23:28.156
Aw, Boimler. That's really nice.
Thanks, man.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.658
Now come on. I got the keys
to the captain's yacht.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.118
Wait, what?
You shouldn't have those.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.619
No, it's cool.
I signed them out in your name.

23:32.702 --> 23:33.662
-Last one there's a Fletcher.
-Wait. No, no, no.

23:33.745 --> 23:34.955
That's not the lesson here!

23:35.038 --> 23:36.248
MARINER:
Lower Decks, let's go!
