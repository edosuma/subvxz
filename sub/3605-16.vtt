MR. BENNET:
Previously on Heroes.

00:03.045 --> 00:04.546
No matter what happens
in your world,

00:04.630 --> 00:06.086
you can always
come back to this one.

00:06.174 --> 00:07.334
I know.

00:07.425 --> 00:08.756
I'll find my way.

00:09.218 --> 00:10.253
Nice to meet you.

00:10.386 --> 00:11.501
PETER: Mom, this is Emma.

00:11.596 --> 00:13.427
She's going to kill
thousands of people.

00:13.556 --> 00:14.841
It will be a bloodbath.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.014
Tell me exactly
what you saw.

00:17.101 --> 00:18.932
You cannot save her.

00:19.020 --> 00:20.931
But someone else can.

00:22.565 --> 00:25.056
ANGELA: People think
that dreaming the future
is a gift.

00:25.151 --> 00:26.482
They’re wrong.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.567
SYLAR: I don't want
to be alone,

00:28.654 --> 00:30.485
and somehow
you're supposed
to help me.

00:30.615 --> 00:34.733
I can only imagine
what having
a bunch of excuses

00:34.827 --> 00:36.328
could do to
someone's humanity.

00:36.454 --> 00:37.694
In order to become
human again,

00:37.788 --> 00:40.780
he has to get rid
of all of his powers.

00:43.628 --> 00:44.959
Now was that so hard?

00:45.129 --> 00:46.869
I'm sorry. I'm Gabriel.
Friend of Matt's.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.500
I'm sorry.
He's not here
right now.

00:48.633 --> 00:50.169
Is there any way
that you could tell me
where he is?

00:50.259 --> 00:51.669
It's really important
that I speak with him.

00:52.011 --> 00:53.467
This is your fantasy.

00:53.596 --> 00:54.881
This isn't my life.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.678
Something wrong, sir?

00:57.016 --> 00:58.847
Yeah, something is wrong.

00:59.977 --> 01:01.308
(GRUNTING)

01:42.186 --> 01:44.097
lt's quiet.
Where is everyone?

01:44.272 --> 01:46.684
The carnival
is closed, Samuel.

01:49.986 --> 01:52.773
Everybody saw
what you did
to that town.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.364
They're afraid of me.

01:54.532 --> 01:56.363
Can you blame them?

01:57.368 --> 01:59.700
We finally have
a home here.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.036
A place to make a life.
It's what we wanted.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.035
It's what you told us
that you wanted.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.617
You don't trust me
anymore, do you?

02:07.712 --> 02:08.952
You haven't
for a long time.

02:09.046 --> 02:11.378
So show me why I should.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.211
Part of trust
is faith, Lydia.

02:18.848 --> 02:21.806
Must be very hard
for you to come by

02:21.892 --> 02:26.181
when you can steal a look
into someone's very soul
with just a touch.

02:26.522 --> 02:30.140
After all I've done for you,
for all of them,
I'm the villain?

02:30.234 --> 02:34.398
And you, you, it seems,
have become the empath
to replace Joseph.

02:35.823 --> 02:39.657
Everyone's looking to you now
for their voice, aren't they?

02:39.744 --> 02:42.076
What have you
been telling them?

02:44.040 --> 02:46.372
Nobody respects you anymore.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.917
And I'm gonna win it back.

02:51.589 --> 02:53.204
I love them.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.752
I need them.

03:00.222 --> 03:04.682
And I'll do
whatever I have to do
to prove my worth.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.618
(GIRL SCREAMING)

03:35.966 --> 03:38.799
Don't worry.
I'm here to save you.

03:40.805 --> 03:42.045
(GASPING)

04:00.825 --> 04:04.283
Hey, it's Peter Petrelli.
ls Emma Coolidge there?

04:06.831 --> 04:09.994
Look,Wsimpoﬂant
Just”

04:11.627 --> 04:14.960
Yeah. I already
went by her place,
she's not there.

04:15.506 --> 04:18.498
Look, if you see her,
call me, okay?

04:19.552 --> 04:21.133
Yeah. Thanks.

04:23.264 --> 04:24.470
(SIGHS)

04:25.474 --> 04:27.260
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

04:33.357 --> 04:34.437
Ma?

04:39.363 --> 04:41.399
Janice, honey, you home?

04:41.490 --> 04:42.900
Janice.

04:42.992 --> 04:44.027
SYLAR: Wow.

04:44.535 --> 04:46.617
Haven't you ever heard
of making two trips?

04:46.704 --> 04:49.821
Oh, God. Are you back
inside my head?

04:50.207 --> 04:51.538
(CHUCKUNG)

04:52.293 --> 04:55.660
That's so two months ago.
Here, let me give you a hand.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.462
Calm down, Parkman.
If I wanted you dead,
we wouldn't be talking.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.884
Then what the hell
do you want?

05:03.971 --> 05:05.802
lt's complicated.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.298
My life's taken a turn
since our time together.

05:08.392 --> 05:11.976
I suppose you could say
I'm on a fact-finding mission.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.140
Matt, honey.
MATT: Janice.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.062
Hey. I thought
you'd be at work
by now.

05:16.192 --> 05:18.649
Well, I took Matty
to day care,
my client canceled,

05:18.736 --> 05:20.601
so lucky I was home
because your friend Gabriel

05:20.696 --> 05:22.311
was in the neighborhood.

05:22.406 --> 05:24.692
He is full of stories.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.201
Stories?

05:26.660 --> 05:29.322
From when we were
partners on the force.

05:29.413 --> 05:31.495
So I figured that
you guys would
like to catch up,

05:31.582 --> 05:34.244
so I put a little
late lunch together.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.917
Looks so good.
Thank you.

05:37.379 --> 05:40.746
Parkman, take a load off.
Have a nosh.

05:41.717 --> 05:43.924
We really need
to catch up.

05:50.392 --> 05:53.520
You know, this is
probably not a good time.

05:54.563 --> 05:57.179
In fact, it's not
even a big deal.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.147
It's over. I don't
need to tell him.

05:59.235 --> 06:00.850
You kind of do.

06:00.945 --> 06:04.358
A super-powered serial killer
shape-shifted into a co-ed

06:04.448 --> 06:07.360
and then made
a pie chart
of your life.

06:07.785 --> 06:10.367
It wasn't a pie chart.
It was more like a...

06:10.454 --> 06:12.319
Whatever.
You have to
tell your dad.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.665
Really?

06:14.124 --> 06:17.958
'Cause when Sy|ar
killed my real dad,
he didn't tell me.

06:19.213 --> 06:22.956
I know.
You're right, but...

06:24.552 --> 06:26.383
I know. I know.

06:26.637 --> 06:28.218
"How long are you
gonna hold a grudge?

06:28.305 --> 06:31.388
"The whole silent treatment
is getting old."

06:32.810 --> 06:35.768
We were in a good place
before all this.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.727
Do you want me
to come with?

06:45.281 --> 06:46.566
Yes.

06:49.994 --> 06:53.111
No. This is something
I have to do alone.

06:55.583 --> 06:57.119
I could wait.

06:57.501 --> 06:59.583
It's probably
gonna be a while.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.503
The list of things
we have to talk about, Sy|ar,

07:03.007 --> 07:04.588
the cover-up
of my dad's death.

07:04.675 --> 07:05.915
Let's not forget
about the carnival.

07:06.010 --> 07:10.253
I'm sure there is plenty
my dad's been wanting
to say about that.

07:10.681 --> 07:11.921
Yeah.

07:13.183 --> 07:15.515
Well, good luck.

07:16.437 --> 07:18.598
You're gonna feel better
when it's all over with,

07:18.689 --> 07:21.476
or if not, at least
you'll be caffeinated.

07:55.476 --> 07:56.465
Claire?

07:56.560 --> 07:57.970
Lauren. Hey.

08:00.564 --> 08:02.395
You gonna let me in?

08:03.567 --> 08:05.307
Yeah. Of course.

08:14.370 --> 08:16.326
Where is my dad?

08:16.413 --> 08:19.029
He just stepped out
for a moment.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.574
I brought some coffee.

08:22.836 --> 08:26.044
I thought it was time
to talk things
over with him.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.679
I'm sorry, but why
are you here, exactly?

08:36.266 --> 08:37.597
(STUTTERS)

08:39.770 --> 08:41.681
Your father and l are...

08:41.772 --> 08:45.060
No, no. That's not
what I was talking about.

08:46.026 --> 08:51.441
I mean, you have
Primatech files
and satellite maps,

08:51.532 --> 08:57.152
and this is everything
that my dad said that
he would put behind him.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.702
Claire, I'm just trying
to help a friend.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.872
Friends do dinners
and movies.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.540
Okay, you wanna help?

09:03.627 --> 09:06.209
You tell my dad
whatever it is
that he's doing here,

09:06.296 --> 09:08.127
he needs to stop.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.289
I wish it was that simple.

09:10.384 --> 09:12.375
Why? What's going on?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.426
There was an incident.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.925
It was Samuel Sullivan.

09:26.817 --> 09:28.557
What did he do?

09:28.652 --> 09:32.236
They're saying
it was a landslide,
but we know it was Samuel.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.984
Wait. You think
he buried that town?

09:35.743 --> 09:37.654
Can he even do that?

09:37.786 --> 09:41.244
He gains more power
the more specials
he has around.

09:42.332 --> 09:45.574
Two hundred are dead,
and they're still
digging out the bodies.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.001
What are you
planning to do?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.918
You know, your dad's
gonna be back any minute.
Why don't you just take...

09:52.009 --> 09:54.170
Actually,
I have class.

09:55.345 --> 09:57.336
But it looks like
you guys have this
under control.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.046
Sojust tell him
I stopped by.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.221
Claire, wait.

10:00.309 --> 10:01.298
Enjoy the coffee.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.633
Claire.

10:02.728 --> 10:03.717
(SlGHS)

10:10.778 --> 10:13.110
I've always loved
the black and whites.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.778
Are they still
Matty's favorite?

10:14.865 --> 10:16.355
How'd you know that?

10:16.492 --> 10:19.780
Like I said, Parkman and I
used to be pretty tight
back in the day.

10:19.870 --> 10:23.454
We even went through
addiction
counseling together.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.535
We faced
our mutual demons.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.703
You know what, honey,
I'm gonna show Gabe here

10:27.836 --> 10:29.212
what I've been doing
in the basement.

10:29.338 --> 10:32.205
Yes. The wonderful
world of Matt's projects.

10:32.341 --> 10:33.797
You're gonna love it
down there.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.840
I'm sure I will.
(JANICE CHUCKLING)

10:45.562 --> 10:50.556
You're on
a "fact-finding mission".
What the hell does that mean?

10:51.401 --> 10:54.438
I had to make sure
I remembered it right.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.313
Husband and father.

11:00.369 --> 11:03.953
You've really figured out
a way to live
with your ability.

11:05.082 --> 11:07.619
You know,
you may not believe this,

11:08.043 --> 11:10.159
but in some ways
you're actually
stronger than I am.

11:10.254 --> 11:11.835
Look, I'm not
afraid of you, okay?

11:11.922 --> 11:13.287
So if this is
about revenge...

11:13.382 --> 11:16.545
Well, after
what you did to me,
I was tempted.

11:17.469 --> 11:20.461
But I don't want to be
that person anymore.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.472
I need you to go
inside my head again.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.845
(LAUGHING)

11:25.936 --> 11:27.722
You're serious?

11:28.522 --> 11:30.638
Wow. You are insane.

11:32.276 --> 11:36.064
If I am, it's because
that's what my powers
have made me.

11:36.822 --> 11:39.734
I can't live with them
anymore, Parkman.

11:40.409 --> 11:42.775
So you need to
take them away.

11:46.957 --> 11:48.743
You want me to...

11:49.042 --> 11:50.782
How am I supposed
to do that?

11:50.878 --> 11:53.039
You can create
a mental block,
repress them.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.542
I don't really care,
to be honest.

11:56.049 --> 12:00.042
All I know is that
once I'm free from the
temptation of my ability...

12:00.137 --> 12:02.469
Mmm-hmm.
You're gonna be normal?

12:02.556 --> 12:06.048
I'm sorry.
That ship sailed,
what, 50 murders ago.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.638
I'm asking nicely.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.094
The last time that
l was inside your head,

12:10.188 --> 12:12.270
you turned my life
into a living hell.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.393
What makes you think
I'm gonna risk that?

12:14.484 --> 12:16.816
Janice and the kid.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.320
I really do
want to change,

12:21.074 --> 12:24.032
but I'm insane,
remember?

12:25.746 --> 12:28.408
And all I have to do
is point.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.748
Fine. lwill try,

12:32.753 --> 12:35.210
but you have to
let Janice go.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.879
Consider it
a gesture of good faith.

12:50.062 --> 12:51.552
(DOOR CLOSING)

13:01.782 --> 13:03.318
Hey, Mom.

13:04.576 --> 13:05.816
What's wrong?

13:05.911 --> 13:07.776
Oh, it's Nathan.

13:08.205 --> 13:10.161
The stone-cutters called.

13:10.248 --> 13:13.035
They needed
the final wording
for his headstone,

13:13.126 --> 13:15.583
and I didn't know
what to say.

13:15.671 --> 13:18.128
lguess
it's the finality of it.

13:19.508 --> 13:23.467
I mean, they're just words,
but when you write them down,

13:23.595 --> 13:26.007
when you etch them
in stone...

13:26.765 --> 13:28.346
I know, Mom.

13:29.393 --> 13:33.636
Maybe it was selfish
of me, Peter, but
I just needed to see you.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.142
I needed to be sure
you were okay.

13:36.233 --> 13:38.315
Because of your vision?

13:39.820 --> 13:42.027
I had the dream, too, Mom.

13:42.781 --> 13:44.646
I saw all the people,

13:45.075 --> 13:46.406
and Sy|ar,

13:47.119 --> 13:49.735
I think he was trying
to help Emma.

13:51.623 --> 13:53.363
You saw that, too?

13:57.337 --> 14:00.875
Whatever this vision is,
Peter, remember this,

14:02.092 --> 14:06.051
one isolated act
does not make Sy|ar
your friend's savior.

14:17.899 --> 14:20.481
I need you to help me
find him, Mom.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.692
I know you know
where he is.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.441
Sy|ar's never been
far from my thoughts,

14:27.034 --> 14:29.275
but I'm begging you,
don't go.

14:29.703 --> 14:30.692
He murdered Nathan,

14:30.787 --> 14:33.529
and the last time
you faced him,
he almost killed you.

finds out...

through the air,

they had powers
just like us.

But when
we went backstage,

18:36.908 --> 18:40.366

the only power he had
was gravity.

it was always there
to catch him.

If you hurt her,
I swear to God...

32:03.214 --> 32:04.454
That's the problem,
isn't it?

32:04.548 --> 32:05.799
One cruel thought
is all it takes.

32:05.883 --> 32:07.839
These powers
make it so easy.

32:07.927 --> 32:11.715
I understand that, believe me.
But you don't have to
use them like this.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.383
Except I do.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.177
The powers are me now.

32:16.936 --> 32:19.427
You've been there,
dealt with the abilities,
the constant temptation.

32:19.522 --> 32:21.513
Tell me, how do you
compartmentalize?

32:21.607 --> 32:24.314
How do you keep them
from overwhelming
the rest of your life?

32:24.401 --> 32:29.020
You start by accepting
the fact that you're more
than just your abilities.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.948
Come on,
we're people first.

32:33.035 --> 32:35.196
Please, let her go.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.202
(GROANING)

32:45.089 --> 32:47.125
Look, I'll try to do
what you want,

32:47.216 --> 32:49.548
but you got to give me
a couple of minutes,
make sure she's okay.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.375
Last chance, Parkman.

32:52.054 --> 32:53.385
MATT: Come on.

32:53.722 --> 32:54.848
It's okay. Come on.

32:54.932 --> 32:56.138
That's Sy|ar, wasn't it?

32:56.225 --> 32:58.056
I'm so sorry.

32:58.394 --> 32:59.930
This is crazy.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.642
He wants me
to take away his powers
and make him normal.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.472
Meanwhile, I looked
inside his head
long enough to realize

33:05.568 --> 33:07.229
that he's serious,
but I can't give him
what he wants.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.434
Well, forget
what he wants.

33:08.571 --> 33:12.234
I've worked with
monsters like this.
He's broken inside, Matt.

33:12.324 --> 33:16.738
We have to bury him
so that he cannot
hurt anyone else.

33:18.455 --> 33:19.661
Yeah, okay.

33:19.748 --> 33:23.081
Just go. Go.
And don't come back
until I call you.

33:24.461 --> 33:25.962
(DOOR CLOSING)

33:26.130 --> 33:28.337
All right,
get on with it.

33:28.424 --> 33:31.040
You were right.
I was holding back.

33:31.135 --> 33:33.251
It's all about motivation.

33:39.602 --> 33:41.718
GABRIEL:
What ifl told you
that I can be special?

33:41.812 --> 33:45.350
But to do it, I'd have to
hurt a lot of people.
Should I?

33:46.650 --> 33:49.266
You? You can never
hurt anyone.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.230
Mommy.

33:57.286 --> 33:59.277
(BOTH PANTING)

34:04.251 --> 34:06.458
I don't feel any different.

34:07.421 --> 34:10.288
Try something.
Go ahead. On me.
Come on.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.342
You did it.

34:20.935 --> 34:22.846
My powers are gone.
No, they're not gone.

34:22.937 --> 34:26.225
They're just buried
somewhere that you can
never get to them.

34:26.315 --> 34:29.057
You've threatened
my family for the last time.

34:29.151 --> 34:30.311
What did you do?

34:30.444 --> 34:33.277
I know exactly
what scares you,
Gabriel,

34:33.364 --> 34:35.355
and it's being alone
with your immortality.

34:35.491 --> 34:36.606
What did you do to me?

34:36.700 --> 34:39.316
I have trapped you
inside your twisted mind.

34:39.453 --> 34:42.536
You're gonna be alone,
Sy|ar, very much alone,

34:42.623 --> 34:45.865
in this nightmare
that will last forever.

34:45.960 --> 34:47.416
And the best part
about it is

34:47.503 --> 34:49.494
that when I leave here,
you're not gonna
remember what I did,

34:49.588 --> 34:52.625
and you're going to
live every empty day
like it's real.

34:52.716 --> 34:54.217
You said you would help me.

34:54.343 --> 34:57.801
Yeah. Well, I guess
there's still a little of you
left inside me,

34:57.888 --> 34:59.503
because I lied.

35:02.518 --> 35:04.008
Enjoy hell.

35:08.357 --> 35:09.688
Parkman?

35:14.989 --> 35:16.229
Parkman?

35:47.563 --> 35:48.723
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

35:48.814 --> 35:50.020
PETER: Matt?

35:52.901 --> 35:54.152
Matt!

36:30.105 --> 36:33.097
Samuel said you'd come.
Thank God you're here.

36:33.192 --> 36:35.057
He needs your help.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.363
(WOMAN CRYING)

36:40.407 --> 36:42.489
(SAMUEL CHUCKLES)

36:43.118 --> 36:45.951
Finally, there's a doctor
in the house.

36:46.914 --> 36:48.279
What happened?

36:48.374 --> 36:49.363
We were attacked.

36:49.458 --> 36:51.449
You were attacked?
By who?

36:52.127 --> 36:55.619
People who don't
understand us, Emma.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.710
People who fear us.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.458
It doesn't matter.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.554
What matters is
that you're here.

37:08.310 --> 37:10.972
You're notjust going
to heal me, Emma,

37:11.480 --> 37:15.314
you're going to help us
make a new world
for ourselves.

37:16.610 --> 37:17.816
Yeah.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.768
We'll show them, Emma.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.482
We'll show them
how great we can be.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.740
Matt?

37:34.503 --> 37:35.788
Matt!

37:40.759 --> 37:43.341
Hey, man. Sorry.
I was working downstairs.

37:43.470 --> 37:45.006
It's okay, man.
Been a long time.

37:45.139 --> 37:46.925
Yeah. How are you?

37:50.686 --> 37:51.721
What?

37:51.812 --> 37:52.927
Sy|ar is here.

37:53.021 --> 37:54.306
What are you talking about?

37:54.398 --> 37:56.514
I'm talking about
what you're thinking.

37:56.692 --> 37:58.523
You're gonna take him.
You can'tjust take him.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.022
People die, Matt.
Sy|ar has to save them.

38:01.113 --> 38:03.024
Peter, he's
a murderer. Hey!

38:04.116 --> 38:07.449
Come on, stop. Listen,
he's trapped, Peter.

38:09.746 --> 38:11.532
What the hell
did you do?

38:11.665 --> 38:14.702
I went inside his head
and I trapped him
in his worst nightmare.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.954
He'll never hurt
anyone again.

38:17.171 --> 38:18.286
I have to bring him back.

38:18.380 --> 38:19.790
No. No, you can't do that.

38:19.882 --> 38:21.213
You go into his head,
you might not come out.

38:21.300 --> 38:24.212
Peter! Peter, don't!
Peter! No! Peter!

38:40.277 --> 38:41.517
Matt!

38:53.999 --> 38:55.284
Hello!

38:59.421 --> 39:00.706
Hello!

39:06.053 --> 39:07.259
Hello!

39:14.102 --> 39:15.353
Hello!

39:18.106 --> 39:19.357
(WINCING)

39:30.160 --> 39:31.445
(RINGING)

39:37.084 --> 39:38.620
Tracy Strauss.

39:39.169 --> 39:42.753
Noah Bennet told me to call
if anything went wrong.

40:19.459 --> 40:21.165
I went to Bennet.

40:22.212 --> 40:23.452
I thought...

40:23.547 --> 40:25.538
Look what they've done.

40:26.008 --> 40:28.169
These so-called
normal people.

40:32.264 --> 40:34.755
How could you
let this happen?

41:01.960 --> 41:04.576
What I did was wrong,
I know that,

41:06.340 --> 41:10.049
but I was willing
to sacrifice myself
to protect you,

41:11.303 --> 41:14.841
to save this family
that we've all come to love.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.798
But the outside world
has proven once again

41:17.893 --> 41:21.260
that people like us
will never be accepted.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.559
We've all seen it

41:25.651 --> 41:28.768
in the eyes of those
who come to see our shows,

41:28.862 --> 41:31.023
dazzled by our abilities,

41:32.199 --> 41:35.783
but filled with revulsion
over who we are.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.987
I saw it again yesterday,

41:41.583 --> 41:43.995
in that small town
over the hill.

41:46.421 --> 41:50.881
And today, in the bullets
that struck me and
murdered our dear Lydia.

41:55.055 --> 41:56.591
It's time.

42:00.185 --> 42:03.018
It's time we put fear
behind us.

42:06.149 --> 42:08.265
It's time we show the world

42:10.070 --> 42:11.731
what we truly are.
