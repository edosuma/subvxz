00:34.535 --> 00:36.453
I'm telling you,
everything means something.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.439
No, everything does not
mean something, okay?

00:38.539 --> 00:40.541
Sometimes a movie is just a movie.

00:40.791 --> 00:44.461
Sometimes a song is just a song,
sometimes a joke is just a joke.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.697
- Remember those, jokes?
- Yeah, I remember 'em.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.741
Okay. So lighten up.
We have a black President now.

00:48.841 --> 00:49.950
- Be excited.
- Half black.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.869
- A little bit. Just a little excited.
- Half black! Half black!

00:51.969 --> 00:53.662
And whenever something goes well
in the country,

00:53.762 --> 00:56.123
the white people go, "The President's
doing such a great job."

00:56.223 --> 00:57.583
And then whenever there's a problem,
it's like,

00:57.683 --> 00:59.376
"That nigga's ruining everything!"

00:59.476 --> 01:01.795
Nope. We are going to have
a woman president next

01:01.895 --> 01:04.047
- and she is going to be Latina.
- Yeah? Okay.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.691
And she might even be gay.

01:05.858 --> 01:07.968
- And we'll have an Asian president.
- A balanced budget.

01:08.068 --> 01:11.013
And we will have
another handicapped president.

01:11.113 --> 01:12.848
Okay, hold on. We're not gonna
have a handicapped president.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.224
Yes. Yes, we will. We already had one.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.434
- We already had one.
- No, no. I'm talking about

01:15.534 --> 01:16.935
out-the-closet handicapped president.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.520
He was out of the closet.
What is wrong...

01:18.620 --> 01:20.022
- Okay. That...
- Hey, hey. Don't get me wrong.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.231
People knew that he was handicapped.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.483
No, I got nothing
against the handicapped,

01:22.583 --> 01:24.860
but everybody's not as liberal as me,
okay?

01:24.960 --> 01:25.986
The media wasn't better then.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.405
I mean, you "run" for president,
you don't "roll" for president.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.741
Like, you'll "run" a campaign,
you don't "roll" a campaign.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.076
- You are horrible.
- I'm not horrible.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.827
That is sick. What is wrong with you?

01:33.927 --> 01:34.912
- I'm sick?
- Yes.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.247
I'm the one voting for the Mexican
lesbian handicapped president.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.917
Oh, my God. You know what?
People are more accepting now.

01:40.017 --> 01:43.337
And thank God for that because
it is literally rough for women, okay?

01:43.437 --> 01:44.463
Yeah.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.507
But I am hopeful,
because people are changing, okay?

01:46.607 --> 01:47.716
- Really?
- Things are changing.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.093
You need to wake up
and smell the progress.

01:49.193 --> 01:50.177
No, no, no, no.
You need to wake up, okay?

01:50.277 --> 01:51.303
Wake up and smell the progress.

01:51.403 --> 01:52.471
- Nothing's changed.
- Yes!

01:52.571 --> 01:53.555
Some things never change.

01:53.655 --> 01:54.723
- Thank God things change!
- Hey, look at this.

01:54.823 --> 01:57.601
Black man trying to get a cab
in New York City.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.103
- Watch this bullshit.
- What's up, Hammy!

01:59.203 --> 02:00.771
Black man trying to get a cab.

02:00.871 --> 02:03.040
Look at this! Taxi, taxi!

02:03.415 --> 02:04.917
Taxi, taxi! Yeah.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.491
Thank you for joining me
at this special edition of my program

02:12.591 --> 02:14.259
at this great university.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.957
In 2005, Time magazine

02:20.057 --> 02:23.894
voted today's guest
"The Funniest Man in America."

02:24.102 --> 02:27.840
By 2010,
the former stand-up had hit it big

02:27.940 --> 02:34.488
with a string of blockbuster movies,
including Hammy the Bear 1, 2 and 3.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.226
All right, Sanchez, here's the plan.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.478
I need you to get that box
of guns across the street.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.913
We don't got time for that.

02:43.539 --> 02:48.252
Sanchez, you got plenty of time.
You got Hammy Time! Now go!

02:49.878 --> 02:53.465
It's Hammy Time! It's Hammy Time!
It's Hammy Time!

02:53.757 --> 02:54.883
It's Hammy Time!

02:56.885 --> 02:59.429
When you were in school,
were you the class clown?

02:59.888 --> 03:01.098
When's the next Hammy movie?

03:02.808 --> 03:07.646
And after some run-ins with the law
due to a battle with alcoholism...

03:07.896 --> 03:10.732
I mean, I was at this restaurant
the other day,

03:10.941 --> 03:13.610
and I saw this guy drink half a beer.

03:14.403 --> 03:17.281
And I was like, wow,
how the hell he do that?

03:17.781 --> 03:19.491
Do you think you're ever
gonna go back to stand-up?

03:22.119 --> 03:26.540
I am past stand-up.
I've done it. I had fun with it.

03:26.790 --> 03:27.858
Here's the thing.

03:27.958 --> 03:29.751
To me, there's nothing better

03:30.043 --> 03:36.241
than the first day your movie comes out,
and sneaking into the back of a theater,

03:36.341 --> 03:39.078
and just watching people
enjoy themselves.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.638
Did you lose your taste though
for comedy?

03:42.055 --> 03:44.808
I want to make uplifting entertainment.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.602
- I wanna make...
- Like Uprize?

03:46.935 --> 03:50.397
Like Uprize. I want to make
thought-provoking entertainment.

03:51.148 --> 03:52.508
This weekend is big.

03:52.608 --> 03:55.944
Opening today, you can see him
play the Haitian revolutionary

03:56.195 --> 03:59.031
Dutty Boukman in his new movie, Uprize.

04:03.785 --> 04:07.998
And you can also see him getting married
to reality star Erica Long

04:08.498 --> 04:09.583
on Bravo.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.509
Hi!

04:21.178 --> 04:22.596
Look who's here.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.640
- Hi, doll.
- Hey, beautiful.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.543
Dre, my man.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.711
Hey, would you mind getting in
on the other side of the car

04:29.811 --> 04:31.338
and then exiting this side?
Please, it's for the show.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.106
Fuck you, Benny. I'm not on your show.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.234
No, you are on the show,
you're just not getting paid.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.760
Guys, play nice, please.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.070
I always play nice.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.847
It's not me.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.783
Mr. Groom, baby, we are almost there.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.602
We've got three more days
and then we're married.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.745
You happy?

04:46.912 --> 04:50.624
I'm happy. I'm just a little stressed out
from this movie. That's all.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.001
Why are you stressed?
Baby, you did great work.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.319
- I know. I know.
- You murdered that role.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.838
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Okay?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.047
Where's my kiss?

04:57.214 --> 04:58.615
Do we have to do this on camera?

04:58.715 --> 05:00.534
Let's just get off camera.
Let's go back in the car.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.219
If it's not on camera, it doesn't exist.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.224
Our thanks to Andre Allen!

05:09.268 --> 05:11.270
Hammy! Hammy!

05:14.356 --> 05:17.568
You know, today's one of those days
I feel like having a drink.

05:17.776 --> 05:18.969
Not funny. Don't talk like that.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.304
I don't want to hear about you drinking

05:20.404 --> 05:22.431
and I don't feel like
getting you out of jail.

05:22.531 --> 05:24.183
Don't worry, no slip-ups.

05:24.283 --> 05:25.476
- Hey.
- Thanks.

05:25.576 --> 05:27.853
You know, I can't wait to see the movie
play in a theater later!

05:27.953 --> 05:29.396
It's gonna be packed.

05:29.496 --> 05:32.165
It's gonna be something else.
I can't wait.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.985
I love me a big girl.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.837
You moving with confidence.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.423
By the way,

05:39.756 --> 05:41.867
Erica wants you to
wear a red shirt on the plane,

05:41.967 --> 05:44.369
and when you get off, she will have
a camera crew waiting for you.

05:44.469 --> 05:45.929
Camera crew, red shirt.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.998
What, are they scared
they're not gonna be able to find me

05:48.098 --> 05:50.501
amongst the sea of niggas
getting off of private jets?

05:50.601 --> 05:51.585
I'm not wearing the shirt.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.129
Okay, whatever, man.
Let's move on to the next interview.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.940
Next interview? I thought I was done
until XM and the junket.

05:57.107 --> 06:00.194
Well, Charles just texted me this one.
They need you for a few hours.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.347
A Wyclef movie is hard to sell.

06:03.447 --> 06:06.141
Everybody in the barber shop
wants to see you in that bear costume.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.602
They love you in that bear costume.
You gotta wear it, baby.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.937
Yeah, but they can't even see my face.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.898
But they feeling you, son.
That's who you are! You Hammy!

06:12.998 --> 06:15.192
I told you, I don't feel like
doing funny movies anymore.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.294
I don't feel funny.
We talked about this.

06:17.753 --> 06:19.630
Save some of that stuff
for your Times interview.

06:19.963 --> 06:21.548
Times? Fuck the Times.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.634
You act like you've never
had a bad review before.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.969
I could take one, but every one?

06:26.220 --> 06:27.329
"Every one," really?

06:27.429 --> 06:28.972
Come on, man. Look at this shit.

06:29.473 --> 06:34.603
"Andre Allen is the most
pathetic character in cinema today.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.464
"If he ever put out another movie,

06:37.564 --> 06:40.592
"I would not see it
if it was playing in my glasses."

06:40.692 --> 06:43.195
Why the fuck would somebody
say some shit like that?

06:43.362 --> 06:45.097
That's James Nielson.
That's what he does.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.282
He's a critic.
And he won't show his face.

06:47.533 --> 06:48.892
No, fuck James Nielson.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.327
He's been ripping my shit apart
for years.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.662
The next one's a chick.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.689
She just wants to do
a profile piece on you.

06:53.789 --> 06:55.207
And I think she's a big fan of yours.

06:55.374 --> 06:56.542
Fuck the Times.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.235
You're gonna do this, okay?

06:58.335 --> 07:00.112
I'm not going to go
back and forth with you about this.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.506
We talked about it.
It's The New York Times.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.842
Do you hear me? The New York Times!

07:05.175 --> 07:06.285
Let me ask you a question.

07:06.385 --> 07:07.494
When you told me that you wanted to do

07:07.594 --> 07:08.912
that movie Crossbusters,
what'd I say to you, Andre?

07:09.012 --> 07:10.038
"Not a good idea."

07:10.138 --> 07:11.248
When you tell me that you wanted to do

07:11.348 --> 07:12.724
that little baseball movie,
what I say to you, Andre?

07:12.891 --> 07:14.393
You said it wasn't a good idea.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.044
Now, when you tell me
you wanted to do that movie

07:16.144 --> 07:17.963
about the Haitian revolution,
Andre, what'd I say to you?

07:18.063 --> 07:19.690
You said it wasn't a good idea, okay?

07:19.857 --> 07:22.259
No. No, no, no, no, you're wrong, Andre.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.486
That's not what I said.
I said, "Nigga, is you crazy?"

07:24.736 --> 07:26.697
I emailed it! I sent the email out

07:26.905 --> 07:29.808
with a bunch of racial slurs
and bad English

07:29.908 --> 07:31.268
to my own company account!

07:31.368 --> 07:33.812
The reason why I did it, Andre,
was 'cause I wanted to be on file

07:33.912 --> 07:35.689
to show people that I was against this!

07:35.789 --> 07:38.442
I was against this project!
I jeopardized my job.

07:38.542 --> 07:40.085
You know that? I almost ruined my job.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.670
What are you talking about?

07:41.879 --> 07:43.881
A nigga can't get fired
for saying "nigga" to a nigga.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.300
You've never been more wrong.
A nigga can...

07:48.635 --> 07:50.704
A nigga can get fired
for saying "nigga" to a nigga.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.164
A nigga don't run this damn company.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.166
Matter of fact,
if niggas at this company

07:54.266 --> 07:56.126
found out that I was using
the word nigga in here,

07:56.226 --> 07:57.795
my black ass would be on the street.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.171
So you're wrong, nigga.

07:59.271 --> 08:01.799
I guess you're right, nigga,
but I don't want to do this.

08:01.899 --> 08:03.133
I hate James Nielson.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.053
I hate the Times.
Everything I do, they trash.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.262
Not the funny stuff.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.406
Look, Andre,
they're gonna write the story anyway.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.683
And I mean, it's hard enough
getting you a job as it is.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.811
I mean, it's not like everybody's
knocking on your door for work.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.746
It's really hard to get you work.
You know that, I know that.

08:15.913 --> 08:17.289
Do you think the wedding is hurting me?

08:17.456 --> 08:18.941
Are you kidding me? Listen, Andre,

08:19.041 --> 08:21.193
the wedding is the best thing
that you got going right now.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.486
And let's be honest.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.029
Andre, if this thing flops,

08:24.129 --> 08:25.589
we could be talking
Dancing With The Stars, man.

08:25.714 --> 08:27.116
Dancing With the Fucking Stars?

08:27.216 --> 08:29.593
Yes. Dancing With The Stars.
That's where you're at right now.

08:29.927 --> 08:32.346
Andre, all these people want to do
is follow you around for one day.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.181
Let them follow you around!

08:34.306 --> 08:37.458
You know, if I get the word out,
this movie could still be a big hit.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.186
It could be like a Haitian Django.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.005
If you say so, Andre, then yes.
Hold on. Hold on.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.440
Hey! Hey! Hey!

08:43.565 --> 08:44.842
What is going on?
Where's everyone running to?

08:44.942 --> 08:46.885
Zoolander's in the conference room!

08:46.985 --> 08:49.488
Ben Stiller's in the conference...
These white people don't tell me shit!

08:50.072 --> 08:52.407
Yo, Silk! Where's the car?

08:52.824 --> 08:54.326
It's in range.

08:54.618 --> 08:56.620
Hey, how'd it go with Charlie Rose?

08:57.579 --> 08:58.914
Chelsea Brown.

08:59.498 --> 09:00.499
From the Times.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.167
Yes, from the Times.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.170
How'd it go? I thought
you were supposed to be watching.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.589
You a real journalist,
or like Miss Detroit?

09:07.965 --> 09:09.007
Funny.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.034
Look, they just told me
that you're gonna be doing this.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.578
I'm sorry if I'm late.

09:12.678 --> 09:13.804
Congratulations on the wedding.

09:14.096 --> 09:15.097
And the movie.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.792
You know, some friends and I saw you
a few years back at Purchase.

09:18.892 --> 09:19.935
You were really great.

09:20.143 --> 09:22.212
Thank you very much
for doing this interview.

09:22.312 --> 09:25.466
Why, 'cause your boy James Nielson
said he wouldn't watch my next movie

09:25.566 --> 09:27.276
if it was playing in his glasses?

09:27.734 --> 09:30.070
James.

09:30.404 --> 09:33.182
Hey, who would have thought Google
would have made that possible, right?

09:33.282 --> 09:36.660
Look, you're about a half hour late.
If I were you, I would get started.

09:36.994 --> 09:39.913
Okay. I just need to go home first.

09:40.163 --> 09:42.332
They just told me
that we were doing this.

09:42.499 --> 09:43.667
I don't have my recorder.

09:43.876 --> 09:46.044
Recorder? What are you, Lois Lane?

09:46.170 --> 09:48.238
- Just use your phone.
- No, you don't understand.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.841
I can't do an interview without it.
It's kind of my thing. I'm sorry.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.518
You take these?

10:03.979 --> 10:05.189
Yes.

10:07.482 --> 10:08.509
They're good.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.027
I do photography on the side.

10:10.485 --> 10:13.488
I do a little poetry on the side,
I do a little music on the side.

10:13.739 --> 10:15.073
That's nice.

10:15.407 --> 10:19.244
It's always good to make sure
you never get too good at any one thing.

10:19.912 --> 10:21.814
Okay, I'm almost done.
I just need to change really quickly.

10:21.914 --> 10:23.107
I'm gonna surprise my boyfriend
for his birthday.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.375
A word of advice.

10:25.751 --> 10:27.085
Never surprise anyone.

10:27.252 --> 10:28.337
Why?

10:28.462 --> 10:31.548
Hey, I call my mother before I go over,

10:31.673 --> 10:33.367
'cause I don't want to
walk in there one day

10:33.467 --> 10:35.427
and catch her hugging up
on some other kid!

10:35.719 --> 10:38.889
Hi. Are you going to marry
Princess Erica on TV?

10:39.515 --> 10:40.516
Can I see your phone?

10:43.060 --> 10:44.837
Did you have a baby when you were 10?

10:44.937 --> 10:47.064
Don't take his phone. Mom?

10:47.439 --> 10:49.525
Okay, what are you doing with my phone?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.135
Playing Angry Birds.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.070
But I don't have Angry Birds.

10:53.362 --> 10:54.346
You do now.

10:54.446 --> 10:58.909
Grace? Go finish your work, mamita.
And give the man back his phone.

11:00.244 --> 11:01.353
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.247
I'm Gladys, Chelsea's mother.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.415
Are you ready for the big day?

11:06.083 --> 11:07.918
The wedding. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.170
You're so lucky you found someone.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.865
I hear that being
a cougar is a big thing,

11:12.965 --> 11:15.342
but I can't find anybody
that wants to be couged.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.095
So, I read this stuff
to try to better understand men.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.263
Listen to this.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.098
"Men love it when you gently..."

11:21.431 --> 11:22.416
What are you talking about?

11:22.516 --> 11:24.209
- "...lick their..."
- Okay, no more Cosmo.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.936
Wait a minute.
I thought you wrote this one.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.689
Wait, wait, get out of here.
So you are a real journalist.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.149
I'm sorry,
I didn't know it was a secret.

11:31.275 --> 11:33.402
Shakira Simmons?
What's that? Your stripper name?

11:33.527 --> 11:34.695
Shakara Simmons.

11:34.862 --> 11:37.281
I don't use my real name
for the fluffy stuff.

11:37.781 --> 11:40.576
Okay, I found my Flip,
and we can go now.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.495
So what's up
with all this Cinderella stuff?

11:44.788 --> 11:45.856
Those are my daughter's.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.792
A little girl's reading
The Cinderella Effect.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.044
- Okay, that one's mine.
- Okay.

11:51.461 --> 11:55.365
Don't you think it's kinda odd that
a grown woman is still into Cinderella?

11:55.465 --> 11:58.243
Don't you think that it's kinda odd that
a grown man is still into the Yankees?

11:58.343 --> 12:00.871
Yes, but the Yankees are a real team.

12:00.971 --> 12:03.557
- A-Rod is real?
- Okay, you got me on that one.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.878
And for your information, my daughter
is working on a school project.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.839
You know, where they have to
rewrite a classical story

12:10.939 --> 12:13.317
and she's doing one
on the real Cinderella.

12:14.026 --> 12:15.552
According to my child,

12:15.652 --> 12:19.139
Cinderella was born a nanny
in the Bronx in 1995, okay?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.683
Her mama was a nanny and her secret
father was the mean white landlord,

12:21.783 --> 12:22.893
who had three daughters.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.187
Cinderella had to do all the things
that a nanny has to do,

12:25.287 --> 12:27.815
she had to cook and clean,
and do everything for her sisters.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.292
And then one day, Prince came into town

12:30.501 --> 12:33.086
and was doing a concert
that everyone wanted to attend.

12:33.295 --> 12:37.508
But the landlord forbid her to go,
so she waited until her sisters left,

12:37.716 --> 12:40.411
and then snuck into the concert
and was the prettiest girl there.

12:40.511 --> 12:42.179
Prince didn't want to hang
with anyone else,

12:42.304 --> 12:43.580
and then she noticed
that her sisters were leaving

12:43.680 --> 12:45.182
and she knew she had to go.

12:45.349 --> 12:48.143
But she also knew
that she wanted to see Prince again.

12:48.519 --> 12:51.772
So, she did what girls do
when they want to see a guy again.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.190
Hand job?

12:55.359 --> 12:56.401
She left something.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.697
Only two days
until the Wedding Spectacular.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.850
The jury's still out
on which shoes Erica will wear.

13:02.950 --> 13:05.144
So were you the class clown growing up?

13:05.244 --> 13:06.578
Class clown?

13:07.037 --> 13:08.814
Is that why we went back
to get this recorder,

13:08.914 --> 13:11.708
so you can ask me
if I was the class clown?

13:12.584 --> 13:14.194
Look, I am really sorry
to break it to you,

13:14.294 --> 13:16.321
but not everybody knows
your origin story.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.448
You know what?

13:17.548 --> 13:19.424
Why don't you just skip
the hack questions

13:19.550 --> 13:20.759
and go right to something good?

13:21.218 --> 13:23.554
All right. Good questions, huh?

13:23.762 --> 13:25.305
How come you're not funny anymore?

13:25.556 --> 13:27.224
And what's up with this wedding?

13:27.516 --> 13:29.351
I mean, it seems really out of control.

13:29.560 --> 13:30.894
Who the fuck are you?

13:31.562 --> 13:33.564
You don't know me. Are you my agent?

13:34.398 --> 13:36.508
You had your kid so young
you guys share math class,

13:36.608 --> 13:38.068
and you're judging me?

13:38.402 --> 13:40.596
You're asking me if my relationship

13:40.696 --> 13:42.573
- with my fiancee is real.
- Yes.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.741
Wait, hold on a second.

13:45.742 --> 13:46.869
It's my career move.

13:47.119 --> 13:48.161
Go on.

13:49.413 --> 13:50.414
Hey, honey.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.065
- Hey, baby.
- What's going on?

13:52.165 --> 13:54.943
Yeah, no. I'm here at the place.
And it looks sick.

13:55.043 --> 13:58.130
It's like epic, babe, it's epic.
It's a story.

13:58.422 --> 13:59.490
Yeah, we're doing the blocking

13:59.590 --> 14:01.492
and I'm looking at head shots
of flower girls.

14:01.592 --> 14:02.885
She's got buck teeth.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.720
Is my stand-in as nervous as I am?

14:04.887 --> 14:07.164
Stop it.
Everything looks just great, okay?

14:07.264 --> 14:08.932
I just wish you were here to see it.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.334
How's your press going?

14:10.434 --> 14:12.769
It's going okay
when they ask about the movie.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.506
Baby, don't worry
about what they're saying.

14:15.606 --> 14:18.217
Your movie is way over their heads.
Did you pick up your tux?

14:18.317 --> 14:20.569
No, not yet. I'm running a little late.

14:20.777 --> 14:22.112
I look bad, you look bad.

14:22.446 --> 14:23.614
Champagne, Mr. Allen?

14:23.739 --> 14:24.907
Yeah, sure.

14:26.450 --> 14:28.685
Are you gonna drink that,
Mr. Ankle Bracelet?

14:28.785 --> 14:30.145
I always say yes.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.414
'Cause whenever you say no,
people want an explanation.

14:32.623 --> 14:35.292
Yeah, I'm the same way with meth.
I just take it.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.961
Is it true that Erica
helped you get clean?

14:38.295 --> 14:39.963
Do you even know what my movie's about?

14:40.172 --> 14:41.740
It's about Dutty Boukman,

14:41.840 --> 14:44.368
a self-educated slave
who, once in Haiti,

14:44.468 --> 14:45.744
became one of the leaders
of the revolution

14:45.844 --> 14:48.372
where Haitian slaves
killed over 50,000 whites.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.499
Yay, dead white people.

14:50.599 --> 14:52.059
Dutty did not shut up and play nice.

14:52.226 --> 14:55.354
You know, normally, after someone says
they saw your movie,

14:55.938 --> 14:59.091
they give you some sort of opinion,
you know...

14:59.191 --> 15:02.094
They go, "I saw your movie
and I thought it was good."

15:02.194 --> 15:04.596
And you know, sometimes
they don't like your movie and they go,

15:04.696 --> 15:06.615
"I saw your movie
and I thought it was interesting."

15:06.782 --> 15:11.019
Yeah, it was interesting how
you ended the movie before you showed

15:11.119 --> 15:13.897
how the French had cut his head off
and paraded it around the country.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.666
But I'd like to ask you
this question first.

15:16.834 --> 15:20.170
How do you think being sober
has affected your career?

15:20.546 --> 15:21.672
It hasn't.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.426
I think it has. I know it has.

15:26.844 --> 15:28.470
I mean, really.
What do you know about sobriety?

15:28.804 --> 15:31.473
What do I know about sobriety?
What don't I know?

15:31.640 --> 15:34.643
"God grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change...

15:34.768 --> 15:36.228
"...the courage
to change the things I can

15:36.395 --> 15:39.214
"and the wisdom to not smoke crack."

15:39.314 --> 15:40.315
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:40.691 --> 15:44.027
Is that more research,
or are you in recovery?

15:45.612 --> 15:46.697
Four years.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.950
Four years? I'm four years.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.286
I drank everything, it didn't matter.

15:52.536 --> 15:55.539
It got really bad
when I started guzzling hand sanitizer.

15:55.706 --> 15:57.541
Hand sanitizer?

15:58.083 --> 16:00.544
- Did you ever drink Sterno?
- What the fuck is Sterno?

16:00.878 --> 16:04.590
Yeah, Sterno, you know those little cans
they put at the buffet to keep food warm.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.592
That's some Amy Winehouse shit.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.181
Can we get back to this idea that
your sobriety hasn't affected your work?

16:13.724 --> 16:16.210
Did Erica actually get you clean,
as rumor has it?

16:16.310 --> 16:19.463
No, I got myself clean.
You need to stop listening to rumors.

16:19.563 --> 16:20.547
Hammy!

16:20.647 --> 16:22.399
What got you clean, Miss Sterno?

16:23.483 --> 16:27.070
I don't know. My mother. My kid.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.407
Maybe I just got tired of waking up
with strange dicks in my face.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.786
Too much info. What...

16:34.912 --> 16:37.581
Okay, your turn
Mr. "I Got Myself Clean."

16:37.915 --> 16:39.917
- Rigorous honesty?
- Yes.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.611
You guys rip me apart
every chance you get.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.279
Why should I talk to you?

16:44.379 --> 16:45.714
I've got nothing to do with that.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.366
Yeah, but that's your people.

16:47.466 --> 16:49.493
Look, if you're gonna
just cut my head off

16:49.593 --> 16:52.746
and parade it around the square,
I don't need to help you with that.

16:52.846 --> 16:55.849
I'm not here to hurt you.
I just want a decent story.

16:56.266 --> 16:59.269
You give me a couple
of really great honest things,

16:59.728 --> 17:02.064
stuff you haven't told everybody else,

17:02.272 --> 17:05.275
some real inside stuff,
rigorous honesty stuff,

17:05.943 --> 17:09.279
and I promise you...
I will be more than fair.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.449
- On the record.
- On the record.

17:14.451 --> 17:15.618
Deal.

17:16.954 --> 17:19.039
Nice to meet you, Andre Allen.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.415
I look forward to interviewing you,
Andre Allen.

17:22.542 --> 17:26.713
Okay, let's try this again.
First truthful question.

17:26.922 --> 17:28.257
What was your bottom?

17:28.966 --> 17:32.302
First truthful answer. Houston.

17:38.767 --> 17:41.270
So I get off the plane in Houston.

17:44.648 --> 17:47.968
Now, I'm expecting the comedy club
to send some kid to pick me up.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.530
But I get to the gate
and to my surprise, I'm met by...

17:53.824 --> 17:55.726
Hey, wassup? You came to pick me up?

17:55.826 --> 17:58.562
Yeah, man. Hey, sorry I didn't have
one of them little signs, man.

17:58.662 --> 18:01.774
I'm Jazzy Dee, CEO
at the Code J Enterprises, man.

18:01.874 --> 18:03.358
- Welcome to Houston.
- Thanks a lot.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.944
We promoting your show, man.
You know what I'm saying?

18:06.044 --> 18:07.529
- How was your flight? Good?
- Yeah, it was pretty good.

18:07.629 --> 18:08.655
That's great. Great, man.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.158
You know, tickets are a little slow
'cause of the hair show in town,

18:11.258 --> 18:13.243
but don't worry,
we're gonna have a big walk-up, dawg.

18:13.343 --> 18:16.471
Okay. Okay. So about...
How far is the hotel? I'm starving.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.916
About 45 minute.
Bruce Bruce is already there.

18:19.016 --> 18:20.334
Like I say, this my town.

18:20.434 --> 18:22.252
Anything you need,
you let a brother know.

18:22.352 --> 18:24.004
I'm the motherfuckin' man
in Houston, dawg.

18:24.104 --> 18:27.107
Anything you need, coke, weed, drank.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.735
You know, syrup.
You want some of that syrup?

18:29.860 --> 18:31.011
- No, no, I'm good.
- That's good.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.763
'Cause I'm the motherfuckin' man
in Houston, man.

18:32.863 --> 18:34.056
I'm gonna tell you that right now.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.158
I'm the motherfuckin' man
in Houston, baby!

18:37.201 --> 18:39.536
Hey, you see how I do it, right?

18:39.870 --> 18:41.105
No check-in or nothing.

18:41.205 --> 18:43.190
I just walk through the door,
through the lobby, man.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.401
They just giving me the key.
You know what I'm saying?

18:45.501 --> 18:47.778
I told you, I'm the motherfuckin' man
in Houston, dawg.

18:47.878 --> 18:49.446
I got you a suite.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.698
Everything.
All the amenities, everything good.

18:51.798 --> 18:55.219
Jacuzzi tub, a little living room.
Bed got a duvet on it.

18:55.385 --> 18:58.388
You can lay down all over that, man.
So you straight?

18:58.639 --> 19:00.791
I'm straight. I'm straight.
Yo, check this out.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.643
So, I gotta get dressed, right?

19:02.893 --> 19:06.213
But a little later, why don't you come by,
scoop me up,

19:06.313 --> 19:08.715
then we hit some clubs,
and you know, promote the show?

19:08.815 --> 19:12.136
I like that. I like that.
You're about your paper, boy.

19:12.236 --> 19:13.804
I'm about it, baby.
I'm about it 'bout it.

19:13.904 --> 19:14.972
I'm gonna see you about 11:00.

19:15.072 --> 19:16.949
- By 11:00. By 11:00.
- Okay. All right, cool.

19:17.074 --> 19:18.075
Hey...

19:18.534 --> 19:20.686
Dre, you mind if I get
some of them hangers, man?

19:20.786 --> 19:22.329
I need some wooden hang... Damn it.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.081
They got the...

19:24.414 --> 19:26.750
They got the lock on 'em!
They got the lock on 'em!

19:26.917 --> 19:28.919
They hip to your boy.
Who the man in Houston?

19:29.336 --> 19:31.421
- Jay Dizzle!
- Motherfuckin' man!

19:34.258 --> 19:35.759
This is Andre Allen.

19:36.093 --> 19:37.594
Come on out tomorrow night,

19:37.928 --> 19:42.266
to see me and my man, Bruce Bruce,
at the Laugh Shack!

19:45.936 --> 19:47.271
Laugh Shack.

19:59.741 --> 20:01.685
This is how I do it every day.
It's how I live.

20:01.785 --> 20:04.354
Strictly V.I.P. for me and my nigs.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.397
You know, I told you,

20:05.497 --> 20:07.374
I'm the motherfuckin' man
in Houston, dawg!

20:07.541 --> 20:09.376
You don't even know
what it's like out there, man.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.779
Nigga be on the other side
of the ropes talkin' about,

20:11.879 --> 20:13.864
"Hey, Jazz, how can I get in V.I.P.?"

20:13.964 --> 20:16.133
I'm like, "Nigga, get a better life!"

20:19.052 --> 20:22.723
You crazy, Jazzy.
But, look, we got to make a run.

20:22.973 --> 20:25.559
- Bye, Andre. Bye-bye, Bruce.
- Bye.

20:25.893 --> 20:28.478
See you all later.
Hey, beep me, Jazz. Don't forget.

20:28.979 --> 20:30.814
Don't run too far.

20:30.981 --> 20:32.399
- Yeah.
- Beep you, all right.

20:33.150 --> 20:34.318
- Bye.
- Yeah.

20:34.651 --> 20:35.652
Take care, ladies.

20:35.903 --> 20:37.721
Could we get another bottle over here?

20:37.821 --> 20:38.906
Thank you!

20:39.072 --> 20:40.157
Yes.

20:40.490 --> 20:41.783
Yeah.

20:41.992 --> 20:44.995
Hey, man, like I said, dawg,
them two girls right there?

20:45.120 --> 20:46.997
They gonna come by the hotel later.

20:47.206 --> 20:48.207
Get out of here!

20:48.415 --> 20:49.483
I'm the motherfuckin' man, dawg!

20:49.583 --> 20:50.734
Oh, man!

20:50.834 --> 20:52.669
Yo, yo, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz!

20:52.920 --> 20:54.922
My wife's family's from Houston, man!

20:55.380 --> 20:58.033
One of those bitches might know
her cousins or something, playa!

20:58.133 --> 21:00.677
No doubt, no doubt, Bruce,
I respect that.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.514
I'll give you a full, official time-out
on that, nigga.

21:03.680 --> 21:04.832
- But you!
- Yo.

21:04.932 --> 21:07.684
You, my nigga!
I know you can handle two bitches!

21:08.143 --> 21:09.878
If I hadn't been drinking all night,

21:09.978 --> 21:13.023
I would have known
this was too good to be true. But...

21:13.524 --> 21:14.675
Bring four, nigga! Bring four.

21:14.775 --> 21:16.260
- Four bitches?
- Four. Four. Four.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.429
I tell you, if I had four bitches,

21:18.529 --> 21:20.347
I'd have one of 'em
braiding my motherfuckin' hair,

21:20.447 --> 21:22.099
and the other motherfuckin'
doing my taxes!

21:22.199 --> 21:24.101
Goddamn, nigga! Goddamn.

21:24.201 --> 21:25.853
Is some smart hos out here.

21:25.953 --> 21:27.913
Some of these hos are smart, nigga,
that's what I'm saying.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.707
I seemed confident,
but that was the liquor talking.

21:31.041 --> 21:34.711
H-town! Who the motherfuckin' man?

21:34.962 --> 21:36.363
I mean, what you gotta understand is

21:36.463 --> 21:40.676
even when you're a little famous,
and that's all I was, a little famous,

21:40.926 --> 21:43.595
people lie and exaggerate to you
all the time.

21:43.804 --> 21:48.058
I need to borrow $10,000, man, okay?
I'll never ask you for money again.

21:48.392 --> 21:50.294
Dude, for only 50 grand,

21:50.394 --> 21:53.313
we can control all the water
on the Internet.

21:53.730 --> 21:56.733
Don't worry, I won't get pregnant.
My pussy's broken.

21:58.068 --> 22:00.012
Anyway, I get back to the hotel

22:00.112 --> 22:02.364
and get what I used to call
some "ho sleep."

22:02.489 --> 22:04.141
That's that horrible sleep you get

22:04.241 --> 22:06.994
when you think there's a chance
a ho might come over.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.097
Hey, Andre.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.391
Hey, wassup? I forgot about you two.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.043
What you got poppin' up in here?

22:31.143 --> 22:32.186
I can't wait for your show.

22:32.436 --> 22:35.480
Bruce Bruce is so funny.
I'm friends with his wife's cousin.

22:35.647 --> 22:36.690
Do you got a minibar?

22:36.857 --> 22:38.525
Yeah, yeah, I got a minibar.

22:39.067 --> 22:42.070
What y'all want?
Chicken fingers? Breakfast?

22:42.279 --> 22:43.447
Jalapeno poppers?

22:43.614 --> 22:47.701
Jalapeno poppers?
Okay, just let me call and see...

22:49.912 --> 22:51.079
Chicken.

22:51.413 --> 22:52.748
This is good.

22:55.459 --> 22:57.377
They were wildin' at the club
when you left.

22:58.587 --> 23:00.214
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

23:00.923 --> 23:02.257
You want some?

23:02.591 --> 23:04.510
Room service is my jam.

23:09.348 --> 23:10.833
- We got some more.
- What? I'm a...

23:10.933 --> 23:12.142
We got whatever you need.

23:24.780 --> 23:26.198
Okay.

23:45.342 --> 23:46.426
Yeah.

24:00.107 --> 24:01.233
Oh, yeah.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.196
Yeah.

24:07.990 --> 24:09.892
I mean, honestly, I couldn't believe

24:09.992 --> 24:12.661
God had blessed me
with these two angels.

24:17.374 --> 24:20.544
Hey, do not disturb!

24:21.003 --> 24:23.338
- Beat it.
- I don't need anything!

24:24.464 --> 24:25.632
Fucking maids.

24:29.178 --> 24:30.370
Well, well, well.

24:30.470 --> 24:32.222
- What do we have here?
- Hey, hey.

24:32.389 --> 24:34.099
Are you all doing a pillow fight?

24:34.224 --> 24:35.893
That's my shit right there.

24:39.313 --> 24:41.064
Oh, my God. Were you scared?

24:41.231 --> 24:42.841
Yes, I was scared. I'm naked

24:42.941 --> 24:45.427
and a man walks in the room
and starts undressing.

24:45.527 --> 24:47.262
That look good, man.

24:47.362 --> 24:48.530
Hey, let me get some of that.

24:49.865 --> 24:52.017
- Hi, Jazzy.
- Hey, Jazzy.

24:52.117 --> 24:54.995
My dick was gone,
it looked like a button on a mink coat.

24:55.204 --> 24:56.522
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

24:56.622 --> 24:58.440
Yeah, daddy Dee's getting it!

24:58.540 --> 24:59.733
Who the motherfuckin' man in Houston?

24:59.833 --> 25:01.110
You're the motherfuckin' man!

25:01.210 --> 25:02.753
You're the man. We love you.

25:03.462 --> 25:04.988
Look at that tow truck.
Look at that tow truck.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.340
Back that thing up on it.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.842
Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep.

25:09.051 --> 25:10.619
- Harder. Harder.
- Yeah.

25:10.719 --> 25:13.055
Jazzy Dizzle. Gettin' it.

25:14.056 --> 25:16.141
I wanted to run away, but I was naked.

25:17.267 --> 25:18.477
Yeah.

25:18.894 --> 25:19.895
How did you feel?

25:20.103 --> 25:21.480
I was terrified.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.273
Yeah, yeah.

25:23.482 --> 25:25.776
Hey, bitch. Get your ass over here.

25:26.235 --> 25:27.277
Me?

25:29.404 --> 25:30.739
Coming, Daddy.

25:31.198 --> 25:34.309
These girls that I thought were angels
two seconds ago,

25:34.409 --> 25:36.870
are now the most disgusting things
I've ever seen.

25:37.955 --> 25:39.248
Oh, yeah.

25:41.208 --> 25:42.334
What'd the room smell like?

25:42.751 --> 25:45.796
What did the room smell like?
What kind of question is that?

25:45.963 --> 25:46.947
Come on.

25:47.047 --> 25:49.716
Scared motherfucker, ass
and smoked ribs.

25:50.133 --> 25:51.927
But the most disgusting part...

25:52.135 --> 25:55.013
- No!
- Yes!

25:55.222 --> 25:57.057
I think, I think I'm coming!

26:01.812 --> 26:03.438
It was like Old Faithful.

26:05.190 --> 26:07.359
It was just everywhere.

26:07.985 --> 26:11.697
Like the garbage truck had to come
and lay salt to get rid of it.

26:12.781 --> 26:14.283
So finally, they leave.

26:14.491 --> 26:16.226
I assume it's to do coke.

26:16.326 --> 26:18.203
You know, people get real stingy
with their coke.

26:39.683 --> 26:40.684
Hey, wassup?

26:41.018 --> 26:42.352
Where's Jazzy?

26:42.644 --> 26:44.922
I don't know.
I thought you all went somewhere.

26:45.022 --> 26:46.215
Yeah, right.

26:46.315 --> 26:48.509
You don't know where
your best friend Jazzy's at?

26:48.609 --> 26:50.194
Best friend?

26:50.527 --> 26:53.739
Hey, I just met him today.
He's not really my best friend.

26:54.156 --> 26:56.867
I mean, is something wrong?
Is there a problem?

26:57.034 --> 26:58.535
Yeah, there's a fucking problem.

26:58.869 --> 27:01.480
Your best friend said
if we came over here and fucked you,

27:01.580 --> 27:02.606
we'd get $1,000.

27:02.706 --> 27:04.149
$1,000? What the... Hey, hey, hey...

27:04.249 --> 27:06.485
And now I cannot find his ass.

27:06.585 --> 27:09.338
Hey, he ain't tell me shit,
and even if he did,

27:09.671 --> 27:12.007
why would I pay you to fuck him?

27:12.424 --> 27:14.201
I mean, I'm nasty, but I'm not a freak!

27:14.301 --> 27:15.969
I don't care!

27:16.470 --> 27:18.414
You better get us our money and soon,

27:18.514 --> 27:20.499
or I'm gonna yell
"rape" up in this bitch

27:20.599 --> 27:23.227
and your ass is gonna go to jail!
Do you hear me?

27:23.352 --> 27:25.129
- I ain't givin' y'all...
- Do you hear me?

27:25.229 --> 27:26.396
I got nothing to do with Jazzy!

27:26.563 --> 27:27.648
Rape!

27:31.026 --> 27:33.470
I told you I'm the motherfuckin' man
in Houston, right?

27:33.570 --> 27:35.697
If I didn't know that judge,
you might still be in there.

27:35.864 --> 27:37.241
Look, I'm gonna drop
Dede off at practice,

27:37.366 --> 27:39.576
then get you back to the hotel,
you get some rest.

27:40.536 --> 27:41.870
I mean, after Houston,

27:42.079 --> 27:44.081
I totally quit drinking.

27:44.790 --> 27:47.626
From that point on,
I never had a drink again.

27:49.670 --> 27:52.339
No donuts!
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

27:52.714 --> 27:55.325
There it is,
let me be your prisoner of love.

27:55.425 --> 27:56.785
- How about that?
- You know you need to back up.

27:56.885 --> 27:58.662
Lock me up! Put the key in your bra!

27:58.762 --> 28:00.264
Let me come and get it with my teeth!

28:01.098 --> 28:02.432
Yeah, Charles.

28:02.641 --> 28:04.393
It's just the matinees.

28:04.977 --> 28:07.729
Hey, people are still at work.
It'll pick up tonight.

28:08.063 --> 28:11.692
Look, I just walked in the jewelry store,
and I will check in with you later, okay?

28:17.072 --> 28:18.407
Here you go.

28:22.828 --> 28:25.080
- These aren't the rings.
- They're not?

28:25.455 --> 28:27.583
I mean, those are the rings,
but there's an extra ring there.

28:27.833 --> 28:31.086
Let me go get Michele.
I think she dealt with it.

28:34.423 --> 28:36.800
- Hey, excuse me, sir. No, no, no.
- I just wanted...

28:37.426 --> 28:39.136
Mr. Allen, hi.

28:39.261 --> 28:40.804
Is there a problem with your ring?

28:41.138 --> 28:42.556
Well, there's another ring there.

28:43.432 --> 28:44.725
You're right.

28:44.850 --> 28:48.061
I mean, we're just getting married,
we're not winning the Super Bowl.

28:48.353 --> 28:51.690
Miss Long came by earlier this week and

28:52.274 --> 28:54.776
added onto the order.

28:55.569 --> 28:57.237
Added to the order?

29:03.452 --> 29:04.786
Hammy!

29:06.496 --> 29:08.165
Hey, yo, Hammy!

29:09.833 --> 29:10.859
Hey, Hammy!

29:10.959 --> 29:12.294
Let's go.

29:13.962 --> 29:15.005
So, here are your lines.

29:15.172 --> 29:17.549
The engineer will cue you
when he is ready.

29:17.966 --> 29:19.159
You good?
You need a coffee or anything?

29:19.259 --> 29:20.969
- No, I'm good.
- All right, great.

29:21.762 --> 29:22.930
So,

29:23.680 --> 29:25.082
are you okay now?

29:25.182 --> 29:27.392
I saw you yelling on the phone earlier.

29:27.518 --> 29:28.852
No, I'm fine.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.313
What's on your mind?

29:31.522 --> 29:34.967
Ask me a question. Interview me.
Get in my business.

29:35.067 --> 29:37.553
That's what I'm trying to do.
What happened?

29:37.653 --> 29:39.655
Okay. Let me ask you a question.

29:39.821 --> 29:43.158
If a guy you loved
gave you a wedding ring,

29:43.283 --> 29:45.410
a ring you said you've always wanted,

29:46.119 --> 29:48.247
would you exchange it
because your boss told you to?

29:48.372 --> 29:50.707
Why'd you change the rings
without talking to me?

29:50.916 --> 29:54.069
Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.
I meant to tell you.

29:54.169 --> 29:55.504
I've been so busy, I just forgot.

29:56.547 --> 29:57.714
How does that make you feel?

29:57.840 --> 30:01.218
I didn't say it was me,
I just said if a guy you loved...

30:01.844 --> 30:03.871
So this guy I love...

30:03.971 --> 30:05.389
Which ring did he get me?

30:05.597 --> 30:07.624
The network, those jerks,

30:07.724 --> 30:09.585
they just thought
they weren't camera-friendly enough,

30:09.685 --> 30:10.919
and I would have never
allowed them to do it

30:11.019 --> 30:12.563
if I thought there was
gonna be a problem.

30:13.355 --> 30:15.732
She's a reality star.
Everything's for sale.

30:15.941 --> 30:17.860
Everything's not for sale.

30:19.611 --> 30:21.446
Okay! You ready?

30:22.823 --> 30:27.244
What's up? This is Andre Allen
and when I listen to satellite radio,

30:27.411 --> 30:30.414
I listen to Sirius Hits One.

30:30.914 --> 30:33.917
That's... That's good, just...

30:34.293 --> 30:35.586
Just make it a little funnier.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.755
- Funnier?
- You're a funny guy.

30:40.883 --> 30:42.384
Make it more funny.

30:43.093 --> 30:44.344
Okay.

30:44.845 --> 30:49.666
Hey, wassup, this is Andre Allen
and when I listen to satellite radio,

30:49.766 --> 30:51.768
I listen to Sirius Hits One!

30:53.395 --> 30:56.982
Just, you know, say...
Just put a little...

30:57.274 --> 30:58.400
Put a little stank on it.

30:59.693 --> 31:00.694
Stank?

31:01.778 --> 31:03.363
Stank. Stank.

31:03.614 --> 31:05.616
- Stank?
- Give it stank.

31:05.949 --> 31:08.160
Okay, I don't really know
what you mean.

31:08.327 --> 31:09.494
Could you show me?

31:11.163 --> 31:14.166
You're the funny... I'm not...
Okay, all right. It's like...

31:14.458 --> 31:17.294
Hey! This is Andre Allen,

31:17.669 --> 31:20.339
and when I listen to satellite radio...

31:21.465 --> 31:23.967
I listen to Sirius Hits One!

31:24.468 --> 31:25.802
It's a brand new movie.

31:26.094 --> 31:28.180
- Uprize?
- Uprize. Uprize.

31:28.388 --> 31:29.890
It's in theaters today.

31:30.182 --> 31:31.808
You're playin' a Haitian revolutionary?

31:32.142 --> 31:33.977
- This is a...
- Homosexuals.

31:34.144 --> 31:35.812
- ...homosexual radio station.
- Yeah.

31:36.021 --> 31:38.482
I just want to say, "What's up?"
to all my Haitian fans

31:39.107 --> 31:40.467
that listen to Opie and Anthony.

31:40.567 --> 31:41.802
First of all, who's going to believe

31:41.902 --> 31:44.613
that Hammy the Bear
is a revolutionary out of Haiti?

31:44.947 --> 31:46.532
Hammy's not in the movie.

31:46.698 --> 31:49.226
They should let children out of school
to see this movie.

31:49.326 --> 31:50.494
They should show it in school.

31:50.661 --> 31:55.457
First hundred gay people
get three dollars off their tickets.

31:55.749 --> 31:58.252
If you look at my comedy,
it was always serious.

31:58.502 --> 32:00.070
Just prove your gayness...

32:00.170 --> 32:01.672
- How do we prove we're gay?
- ...and we...

32:01.797 --> 32:03.882
I have some... Some goat meat.

32:04.049 --> 32:06.552
I brought you some Haitian food.

32:06.677 --> 32:08.011
- Goat meat.
- Goat meat?

32:08.178 --> 32:10.497
- Spaghetti with ketchup...
- What is...

32:10.597 --> 32:13.225
...which Haitians actually
eat for breakfast.

32:13.851 --> 32:16.253
- Really?
- Yes. This... This...

32:16.353 --> 32:17.354
Sounds awful.

32:17.521 --> 32:20.966
Yes, spaghetti with ketchup
is the Cheerios of Haiti.

32:21.066 --> 32:23.735
Now, is there going to be
a Hammy the Bear 4?

32:23.986 --> 32:28.156
I hate Hammy the Bear.
I gave you three Hammy the Bears.

32:28.490 --> 32:30.309
I want people to take me serious.

32:30.409 --> 32:33.270
I want people to stop
walking up to me on the street

32:33.370 --> 32:35.314
and making bear sounds.

32:35.414 --> 32:37.858
Andre, what do you have to say
to the white audience here

32:37.958 --> 32:40.878
that is insulted, disgusted,

32:41.211 --> 32:44.865
by your movie, watching 50,000
of their people being killed?

32:44.965 --> 32:49.119
George Bush kills a lot of brown people.
Nobody had a problem with that.

32:49.219 --> 32:50.220
It wasn't a movie.

32:50.345 --> 32:52.723
He killed some...
Like, really killed them!

32:52.890 --> 32:55.209
I fake-kill white people
and it's a problem.

32:55.309 --> 32:56.435
There's outrage.

32:56.560 --> 33:00.564
How many of these white people
actually die on screen?

33:00.856 --> 33:03.801
Probably two, three thousand.

33:03.901 --> 33:04.943
That's it, dawg?

33:06.403 --> 33:08.280
- Stank.
- Stank.

33:13.243 --> 33:14.912
Nice and funny. Go!

33:15.579 --> 33:19.416
Wassup, motherfuckers?
This is motherfucking Andre Allen!

33:19.666 --> 33:24.129
And when I listen to satellite radio,
or scratch my nuts, that is,

33:24.922 --> 33:28.759
I listen to Sirius motherfucking 101,

33:29.051 --> 33:30.219
biatch!

33:31.470 --> 33:32.554
First take was good.

33:33.263 --> 33:34.932
I was wrong on the stank note.

33:35.098 --> 33:38.560
First take had a lot
of wonderful stuff in there.

33:43.440 --> 33:45.609
I hope you're writing
nice things about me.

33:45.943 --> 33:46.944
Let's go.

33:54.618 --> 33:56.453
- What's up, dawg?
- Hammy!

33:57.955 --> 33:59.957
Hammy, don't get brand new.

34:00.791 --> 34:02.960
Hollywood. Hollywood!

34:03.293 --> 34:05.487
Holly, hey, Holly! Hollywood! Get...

34:05.587 --> 34:08.590
Get your ass over here!

34:08.966 --> 34:11.301
Look at who's... Look who's slummin'!

34:12.052 --> 34:14.121
Come here. Come here, boy!

34:14.221 --> 34:16.639
Hollywood! Hollywood!

34:16.806 --> 34:21.311
Roll out the red carpet. There it is.
Hollywood, come on, boy.

34:21.436 --> 34:24.005
What you... I thought you'd be in L.A.,

34:24.106 --> 34:25.815
you know, getting ready
for that big wedding.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.609
I see commercials for it all the time.

34:27.818 --> 34:31.054
Yeah, yeah, I'm in town
just doing some press for this movie.

34:31.154 --> 34:32.322
I leave tonight.

34:33.322 --> 34:34.933
Chelsea here is doing a story on me.

34:35.033 --> 34:36.201
Hello.

34:36.994 --> 34:38.312
So I see.

34:38.411 --> 34:40.022
That's why you bring your ass
around here.

34:40.121 --> 34:42.040
What, you telling her
how bad you had it?

34:42.206 --> 34:43.542
Is that what it is?

34:43.833 --> 34:46.879
Come on, man.
You're coming to the party, right?

34:47.670 --> 34:49.547
Some people got to work.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.134
I'll tell you what.
I'll come to your next bachelor party.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.347
- It's not funny, man.
- Hey, tell me something.

34:57.514 --> 34:58.582
Your next wife,

34:58.682 --> 35:01.143
is she going to be white
or she gonna be Asian?

35:02.978 --> 35:04.521
Still not funny, man.

35:04.688 --> 35:07.733
It's only funny
when you say mean shit, right?

35:09.651 --> 35:10.803
- You know what?
- What?

35:10.903 --> 35:13.989
Imma get out of here.
I'll catch you later, okay?

35:14.406 --> 35:16.575
Hey, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

35:16.867 --> 35:19.745
Come here, come here. Come here.

35:20.037 --> 35:22.981
Look, can you break me off
a little something?

35:23.081 --> 35:24.274
I...

35:24.374 --> 35:27.044
I haven't got my check...
Haven't cashed it yet.

35:33.926 --> 35:34.927
Here.

35:35.802 --> 35:36.887
Really?

35:37.179 --> 35:38.222
Thanks.

35:38.388 --> 35:39.415
I'll put it on your tab, okay?

35:39.515 --> 35:41.291
Thanks, Hollywood.

35:41.391 --> 35:43.602
Thank you, Hollywood!

35:43.894 --> 35:45.312
Hey, nice meeting you.

35:45.521 --> 35:48.232
Hey, don't you believe
a thing he says, okay?

35:49.608 --> 35:51.276
Hollywood! Damn!

35:51.401 --> 35:52.569
Who was that?

35:53.237 --> 35:54.805
My father.

35:54.905 --> 35:56.949
- Hammy!
- Yo, Hammy!

35:57.574 --> 35:59.785
You don't even know what celibacy mean!

36:00.410 --> 36:03.413
Oh, my gosh! Hi! Andre!

36:03.664 --> 36:05.190
Yo! Look what the cat dragged in!

36:05.290 --> 36:06.275
Yes!

36:06.375 --> 36:08.777
- Akil, give your uncle a hug.
- Hey, man, what's up?

36:08.877 --> 36:10.904
Shit, hide the liquor. God damn it!

36:11.004 --> 36:12.239
Hide the liquor?

36:12.339 --> 36:13.924
Look who's talking. Hide the crack.

36:17.177 --> 36:19.413
Yo, homeboy,
well, that wasn't necessary, man.

36:19.513 --> 36:20.664
That was the '80s.

36:20.764 --> 36:24.601
Either you was using or you was selling.
Either way, you got swept up in it.

36:24.768 --> 36:27.521
Hey, man, I'm being nice. I didn't
mention that five grand you owe me.

36:27.688 --> 36:31.091
When I get my income tax check,
you're gonna get yours off top, my man.

36:31.191 --> 36:32.968
You know what,
you gotta have a income first

36:33.068 --> 36:34.736
before you get a check.
You can't tax zero.

36:35.404 --> 36:37.072
Is this Come Down On Fred Day?

36:37.948 --> 36:39.658
Yeah, he's allergic to jobs.

36:40.242 --> 36:42.536
He takes job Benadryl. Just take it.

36:42.661 --> 36:45.289
When he feel a job coming on,
he just take a Benadryl.

36:47.791 --> 36:50.319
Hey, everybody, this is Chelsea Brown.

36:50.419 --> 36:53.130
She's doing a story on me
for The New York Times.

36:53.714 --> 36:56.800
Now, she's gonna ask a few of y'all
some questions. Feel free to answer.

36:57.301 --> 36:59.970
But remember, no snitching!

37:00.596 --> 37:01.789
You must be out your mind!

37:01.889 --> 37:03.557
We're gonna tell all his shit.

37:03.724 --> 37:06.643
You want me to be quiet, you gotta
clear the five thousand, my man.

37:06.852 --> 37:08.687
I said five thousand to be nice.

37:08.896 --> 37:12.049
When it come to me, baby girl,
I'm gonna turn over like a apple pie.

37:12.149 --> 37:15.360
You know what, you just ate a apple pie,
you fat motherfucker. Shut up!

37:19.072 --> 37:20.407
Can I say something?

37:20.657 --> 37:22.893
Jealousy will get y'all nowhere!

37:22.993 --> 37:26.146
I watch Erica's show every week.
I can't wait to see the wedding.

37:26.246 --> 37:27.664
When you gonna bring her around here?

37:27.915 --> 37:28.899
Soon.

37:28.999 --> 37:30.275
That's what you said last time.

37:30.375 --> 37:32.503
And you know what,
I'm still waiting on my invitation.

37:32.794 --> 37:35.172
Hey. I'm not in charge
of the guest list. Okay?

37:35.297 --> 37:36.824
I'm just the groom.
I'm not in charge of all this stuff.

37:36.924 --> 37:38.842
Tell the truth. Tell the truth.
That bitch don't like me.

37:39.176 --> 37:40.761
No, she likes you. She asks about you.

37:40.928 --> 37:42.079
She asks about me?

37:42.179 --> 37:43.247
She asks about you all the time.

37:43.347 --> 37:44.348
What does she say?

37:44.515 --> 37:46.083
She say, "How your big friend doing?"

37:46.183 --> 37:47.351
My big...

37:47.851 --> 37:50.854
Is that what that bitch think about me?
I'm big like that? For real?

37:50.979 --> 37:51.964
I'm just saying.

37:52.064 --> 37:54.133
That's that Hollywood shit, Andre!
That's that Hollywood shit!

37:54.233 --> 37:55.609
I'm just playing. I'm just playing.

37:55.776 --> 37:56.927
Why I ain't got my invitation?

37:57.027 --> 37:58.153
Well, 'cause...

37:58.862 --> 38:00.431
'Cause they figure we could,
you know... The hotel...

38:00.531 --> 38:01.807
Andre, you're full of shit right now.

38:01.907 --> 38:03.408
And the airfare.

38:03.700 --> 38:05.310
Everybody's coming to
the bachelor party, right?

38:05.410 --> 38:08.439
I want to, but General Tao over here...

38:08.539 --> 38:12.609
I said no, 'cause he don't know how
to come home and shit, making it rain...

38:12.709 --> 38:14.278
We need our fucking ones.

38:14.378 --> 38:15.696
Put that down and have a fucking seat.

38:15.796 --> 38:18.699
I mean, come on,
there's gonna be a TV crew there.

38:18.799 --> 38:19.992
Erica picked out everything.

38:20.092 --> 38:21.927
They're even giving out gift bags.

38:22.052 --> 38:24.555
Gift bags? Nigga, kill yourself.

38:25.055 --> 38:28.100
What's wrong, man?
What's wrong with a gift bag?

38:28.225 --> 38:29.585
They got lots of cool shit in there.

38:29.685 --> 38:31.061
Nigga and gift bags.

38:32.396 --> 38:34.356
- He's a corny-ass nigga.
- All right.

38:35.357 --> 38:37.693
I got another five grand. What you got?

38:40.153 --> 38:41.864
Can I get one of them gift bags?

38:43.615 --> 38:45.768
Hey, bro-bro, check this out.

38:45.868 --> 38:48.537
I got the new jawn. The 2016 jawn.

38:48.662 --> 38:52.316
It's real light. Matter of fact,
if you take it off, you won't even sweat.

38:52.416 --> 38:54.318
I can take yours off, too,
if you want me to.

38:54.418 --> 38:56.253
Nah, that's okay, but thanks.

38:56.670 --> 39:00.674
Nigga, put your bracelet back on!
I don't want the cops running in here!

39:00.966 --> 39:04.303
Me? I was there first time
he got on stage.

39:04.845 --> 39:07.598
- How was he?
- He sucked.

39:07.806 --> 39:12.436
Nothing about him was funny.
He was like a bag of dead kittens.

39:12.936 --> 39:16.440
Son, when Nas focus,
he better than Jay, man, I'm sorry.

39:16.607 --> 39:17.733
That's some real shit.

39:17.900 --> 39:19.760
'Cause Tupac was headed for the Oscar.

39:19.860 --> 39:21.987
Or Tupac would be
one of our political leaders.

39:22.446 --> 39:26.241
Tupac might be a political leader,
if he was alive.

39:26.533 --> 39:30.229
But then again, Tupac might be
in a Tyler Perry movie right now.

39:30.329 --> 39:31.413
So you don't know.

39:31.622 --> 39:33.665
- You don't know.
- You never know.

39:33.790 --> 39:36.502
He might be... Tupac might be

39:36.710 --> 39:40.380
the bad dark-skinned boyfriend
in a Tyler Perry movie.

39:40.506 --> 39:42.007
I gotta agree
with that shit right there.

39:42.257 --> 39:44.259
I would hope he's a senator.

39:45.385 --> 39:48.347
But he might be kicking Jill Scott
down a flight of stairs.

39:50.724 --> 39:52.893
Yo. Dre. Yo, Dre!

39:53.060 --> 39:54.378
Who was the funniest?

39:54.478 --> 39:57.356
I think I was the funniest.
I'm tight funny. Yeah.

39:57.648 --> 39:59.216
Yeah? You ever do any stand-up?

39:59.316 --> 40:01.610
Nah, nah, I'm like, you know...

40:01.735 --> 40:04.638
I'm not stand-up funny,
I'm just, like, the funny dude.

40:04.738 --> 40:08.200
Like, you know, put me in a scenario,
and I'll go buck wild.

40:08.492 --> 40:10.561
I always been funnier than Dre!

40:10.661 --> 40:12.579
When my ma's water broke, I was funny.

40:12.704 --> 40:15.916
She went into labor, she wasn't crying,
she wasn't screaming.

40:16.041 --> 40:17.209
She was laughing!

40:17.334 --> 40:19.002
The doctor said,
"What's wrong with her?"

40:19.253 --> 40:20.712
She said, "I'm having Fred."

40:21.171 --> 40:23.073
I'm just saying... I'm just saying,

40:23.173 --> 40:24.950
if it don't work out
with me and this nigga,

40:25.050 --> 40:26.410
I'm gonna get me a white man.

40:26.510 --> 40:28.579
Do you ever think about
how different your life would be

40:28.679 --> 40:29.747
had you stayed together?

40:29.847 --> 40:31.849
It just didn't work out.

40:32.766 --> 40:34.268
I broke up with him.

40:35.185 --> 40:37.688
Yeah. I'm happy where I'm at.

40:38.856 --> 40:40.774
But you must think about it sometimes.

40:42.359 --> 40:44.194
Every fucking day.

40:44.653 --> 40:46.029
I mean, girl,

40:46.321 --> 40:48.991
I used to get mad at him
for playing PlayStation.

40:49.616 --> 40:51.268
What kind of shit was that?

40:51.368 --> 40:53.412
If I'd have known
how successful he was gonna be,

40:53.579 --> 40:55.581
I woulda built him my own PlayStation.

40:55.789 --> 40:57.107
Dre ain't funny.
You know who's funnier than Dre?

40:57.207 --> 40:58.876
Nick Cannon.
That motherfucker hilarious.

40:59.168 --> 41:01.003
Put your top five...
Who's your top five?

41:01.253 --> 41:07.593
Slick Rick, Kane, Rakim,
KRS-One, and Biggie is my fifth man.

41:08.051 --> 41:10.888
And Jay Z is my sixth man.

41:11.054 --> 41:12.247
Would you write any jokes for him?

41:12.347 --> 41:15.058
Yeah, I would, I would,
but, see, everything up here with mine.

41:15.225 --> 41:19.396
My top five is Jay, Nas, Scarface...

41:19.605 --> 41:20.714
Okay, okay.

41:20.814 --> 41:24.151
Scarface, 'cause everybody
got their shit from Scarface.

41:25.485 --> 41:27.154
- Rakim.
- Rakim.

41:27.279 --> 41:31.200
Rakim, and then
I might let Biggie get in there.

41:31.366 --> 41:33.368
Once his mother died, man,
it changed a lot.

41:33.577 --> 41:36.538
He ain't even wanna be funny anymore.
He was like... He was a different Dre.

41:36.747 --> 41:38.749
My top five. Ice-T...

41:39.082 --> 41:41.668
- Ice-T?
- Ice motherfucking T!

41:42.669 --> 41:45.155
Six in the mornin' police at my door

41:45.255 --> 41:47.925
Fresh Adidas squeak
across the bathroom floor

41:48.050 --> 41:50.411
We started drinking young, man,
we was like 12 years old.

41:50.511 --> 41:53.122
We used to get O.E. cans,
and cut 'em out

41:53.222 --> 41:54.431
and make gold teeth out of 'em.

41:54.723 --> 41:56.433
My sixth man's LL Cool J.

41:58.185 --> 42:01.188
Before the show! Before the show!

42:02.689 --> 42:05.884
He was funnier drunk.
Everybody's funnier drunk.

42:05.984 --> 42:08.153
You ever see Oprah drunk?
She's hysterical.

42:08.362 --> 42:09.805
Once he stopped drinking,

42:09.905 --> 42:12.433
once the nigga stopped getting oddy
with the 40s,

42:12.533 --> 42:14.685
something was gone, like, 95% was gone.

42:14.785 --> 42:15.994
This nigga was bugged out.

42:16.203 --> 42:17.521
You think he funny now?

42:17.621 --> 42:19.414
You should've seen him
in the pissy staircases.

42:19.623 --> 42:21.083
This nigga was hilarious.

42:21.416 --> 42:23.152
Dre, if I get married, man,

42:23.252 --> 42:25.529
I'm gonna do the Suge Knight speech
at my wedding.

42:25.629 --> 42:28.991
"If y'all don't want the preacher
all up in the wedding,

42:29.091 --> 42:32.636
"the ring boy all up in the wedding,
come to Death Row!"

42:33.220 --> 42:34.888
Good morning, Buffalo!

42:35.389 --> 42:37.057
Wassup, San Antonio!

42:37.182 --> 42:38.934
This is not another Hammy movie.

42:39.142 --> 42:41.478
And it's about the Haitian revolution.

42:41.645 --> 42:44.314
The greatest slave rebellion
of all time.

42:45.065 --> 42:46.733
Slave rebellion.

42:47.401 --> 42:48.819
It's when slaves rebel.

42:49.152 --> 42:51.154
Taraji P. Henson,

42:52.406 --> 42:54.725
Gabby Sidibe,

42:54.825 --> 42:56.368
Anthony Anderson.

42:57.578 --> 43:00.747
I play a guy named Dutty Boukman.

43:03.834 --> 43:04.835
Yeah.

43:05.419 --> 43:07.946
Well, I've been... I read up on him,

43:08.046 --> 43:10.883
and I've been wanting to do this movie
for a long time.

43:12.718 --> 43:15.220
Yeah, I just found
the story fascinating.

43:18.599 --> 43:21.376
Yeah, well, this is the kind of stuff
I'm trying to get into now,

43:21.476 --> 43:22.811
more serious stuff.

43:25.689 --> 43:29.359
Yes, it's fun for the whole family.
It's educational.

43:29.776 --> 43:31.028
Watch this dunk.

43:31.195 --> 43:32.429
He splits the defenders...

43:32.529 --> 43:33.514
And jams it home!

43:33.614 --> 43:36.617
Yeah, yeah.
It's about the Haitian revolution.

43:37.117 --> 43:38.619
Yeah, the Haitian revolution

43:38.785 --> 43:42.331
was the largest slave uprising
in the Western Hemisphere.

43:42.497 --> 43:44.733
Andre, I know
this party's gonna be crazy,

43:44.833 --> 43:47.611
so if we don't get to talk to each other,
make sure you call me back.

43:47.711 --> 43:48.654
I'll call you.

43:48.754 --> 43:50.380
All right, now,
if my husband answers the phone,

43:50.589 --> 43:53.033
don't hang up,
'cause he knows what time it is.

43:53.133 --> 43:54.968
Now come here, give me a hug.

43:56.553 --> 43:59.456
Hey, Dre, stay black, nigga!
Keep it one hundred!

43:59.556 --> 44:02.893
You heard?
Don't forget where you came from, son!

44:09.149 --> 44:12.694
You got that "I'm texting my boyfriend"
look on your face.

44:13.278 --> 44:14.613
What's his name?

44:16.031 --> 44:17.199
Brad.

44:17.866 --> 44:19.868
So what's he do, Brad?

44:20.160 --> 44:23.330
He's a D.J. He spins at Greenhouse
on Monday nights.

44:23.580 --> 44:25.165
So, how old's he turning again?

44:25.332 --> 44:26.834
- Thirty.
- Thirty.

44:27.209 --> 44:29.211
Hey, man, 30's that birthday.

44:29.545 --> 44:31.864
I remember when I turned 30.
30's scary.

44:31.964 --> 44:33.657
You know,
30's that age where you realize,

44:33.757 --> 44:35.759
"I gotta get my shit together.

44:36.051 --> 44:38.428
"I could actually become homeless."

44:38.762 --> 44:41.640
I mean, not Will-Smith-
Pursuit-of-Happyness homeless.

44:42.516 --> 44:44.977
I mean, like blow-job-
in-the-bus-station homeless.

44:45.227 --> 44:46.211
So, that's what you think?

44:46.311 --> 44:49.339
He's deep in thought right now
about not being homeless?

44:49.439 --> 44:50.674
If he's smart.

44:50.774 --> 44:52.676
If he's not,
he won't think about it till he's 40.

44:52.776 --> 44:53.819
Then it'll be too late.

44:55.612 --> 44:57.030
- You okay?
- Is everybody okay?

44:57.364 --> 44:58.365
My apologies.

44:58.490 --> 44:59.741
Out! Let's get out.

44:59.908 --> 45:01.368
- Let's get out of here.
- Gotta go.

45:01.952 --> 45:03.495
What the hell? We can't just leave.

45:03.871 --> 45:06.373
- Let's go, go, go.
- What are you doing?

45:07.207 --> 45:08.859
- Let's go!
- Come on.

45:08.959 --> 45:10.778
So, what, you're just leaving
the scene of an accident now?

45:10.878 --> 45:13.547
I didn't have an accident.
My driver had an accident.

45:13.672 --> 45:17.301
But if the person that hits us finds out
I was in the car, then they will sue me.

45:17.551 --> 45:19.303
He's right in front of me.

45:19.636 --> 45:21.972
- Not now... Not now, ma'am.
- I hope your dick falls off!

45:22.097 --> 45:24.124
Where's Ralph at?
Get him over here right now.

45:24.224 --> 45:26.210
You know,
if he wasn't clearing a path for you,

45:26.310 --> 45:27.644
I'm sure she wouldn't
even have noticed you.

45:27.811 --> 45:29.021
Is he always so bodyguardy?

45:29.229 --> 45:30.564
"Bodyguardy"? That's a word?

45:30.689 --> 45:31.899
You know what I mean.

45:32.107 --> 45:35.736
Jay-Z is seen walking around
by himself all the time.

45:35.903 --> 45:37.888
Yeah,
but Jay-Z's got a fucking gun, okay.

45:37.988 --> 45:39.406
That's Silk. That's my boy.

45:39.907 --> 45:42.868
We've been together for, you know,
since third grade. He's seen a lot.

45:45.412 --> 45:46.747
You think it's a game?

45:46.872 --> 45:49.374
I'll kill you, motherfucker!
You think it's a game?

45:52.419 --> 45:54.571
I'm not talking about firing him.

45:54.671 --> 45:56.423
I'm just saying, this is New York,

45:56.632 --> 45:58.700
and only people who wanna get paparazzi

45:58.800 --> 46:00.244
roll with their bodyguard all the time.

46:00.344 --> 46:02.162
But if you're too scared
to talk to me one-on-one

46:02.262 --> 46:04.665
without your bodyguard,
your little security blanket,

46:04.765 --> 46:06.141
I completely understand.

46:06.433 --> 46:07.601
Hold on a second.

46:07.851 --> 46:10.254
Okay, I got a new car coming.
It's gonna be about an hour, though.

46:10.354 --> 46:12.214
We should hop on a cab
and head back over to XM,

46:12.314 --> 46:13.982
and finish up all our
West Coast satellite stuff.

46:14.441 --> 46:15.609
You know what?

46:15.943 --> 46:17.219
I'm good.

46:17.319 --> 46:19.012
Just meet me over at the junket,
all right?

46:19.112 --> 46:20.197
What do you mean you're good?

46:20.322 --> 46:21.657
Hey, Brad. It's me...

46:21.907 --> 46:23.183
I'm gonna walk.

46:23.283 --> 46:24.451
Outside?

46:25.035 --> 46:26.036
Yeah.

46:26.787 --> 46:29.690
It's a rough neighborhood,
you're gonna walk around by yourself?

46:29.790 --> 46:31.275
You got an interview in 20 minutes.

46:31.375 --> 46:34.211
Hey, man, I'm good.
Just text me the information, okay?

46:35.295 --> 46:37.631
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure. I'm good.

46:37.965 --> 46:40.968
It's supposed to rain.
I got an umbrella right here.

46:41.218 --> 46:42.369
I'm all right, man.

46:42.469 --> 46:43.537
Silk, don't act like you don't know me.

46:43.637 --> 46:45.472
- If you need me, text me!
- I'll text you!

46:45.681 --> 46:47.599
- What's up?
- It's Angie.

46:48.058 --> 46:49.726
He's scared I'm gonna need him.

46:50.686 --> 46:53.856
No. He's scared
you're not going to need him.

46:54.189 --> 46:56.133
It's staring you
right in the face, all right.

46:56.233 --> 46:59.403
Every Planet of the Apes movie
is about race. Every one.

46:59.820 --> 47:01.805
Okay, I'm assuming you're talking
about the trilogy

47:01.905 --> 47:06.702
that starts off with Charlton Heston
frolicking naked with a black astronaut.

47:06.952 --> 47:09.413
That typical sci-fi movie
that's about the future

47:09.538 --> 47:11.940
and about how the human race
is out of control.

47:12.040 --> 47:13.567
Yeah, it's about race,
but the human race.

47:13.667 --> 47:16.779
No, no, no. It's about
the white man's fear of a black planet.

47:16.879 --> 47:18.363
The darker apes
are bigger and stronger.

47:18.463 --> 47:21.075
The lighter apes are smarter.
That's racist bullshit.

47:21.175 --> 47:23.494
Do you realize
that the original Planet of the Apes

47:23.594 --> 47:26.038
came out on April 3, 1968?

47:26.138 --> 47:28.473
Now, we both know
what happened the next day.

47:28.640 --> 47:29.975
Martin Luther King was killed.

47:42.279 --> 47:44.114
Why don't you just jump in?

47:44.531 --> 47:48.143
You're telling me that James Earl Ray
saw Planet of the Apes

47:48.243 --> 47:49.770
and decided to shoot
Martin Luther King?

47:49.870 --> 47:50.938
Perhaps.

47:51.038 --> 47:53.190
It wasn't the fact
that he was organizing

47:53.290 --> 47:54.817
the Poor People's March
on Washington...

47:54.917 --> 47:56.402
- That, too.
- ...or criticizing

47:56.502 --> 47:58.112
the war or our foreign policy.

47:58.212 --> 48:01.298
What got him shot was talking apes!

48:01.632 --> 48:03.283
Go, Hammy! Go, Hammy!

48:03.383 --> 48:04.718
Go in!

48:07.304 --> 48:08.472
Jump in already!

48:08.722 --> 48:10.791
What I'm saying is,
it's not a coincidence

48:10.891 --> 48:14.378
that a movie about niggas taking over
the world comes out the day before

48:14.478 --> 48:18.006
the most powerful black man on earth
is assassinated.

48:18.106 --> 48:19.591
It's not a coincidence. It's not.

48:19.691 --> 48:21.677
You actually believe that.

48:21.777 --> 48:24.221
Okay, you know what?
I will give it to you.

48:24.321 --> 48:25.639
There are some subliminal messages
in that movie.

48:25.739 --> 48:26.765
Yes, there are.

48:26.865 --> 48:29.560
But you know what? It's just a movie.

48:29.660 --> 48:31.395
It's never... It's never just a movie.

48:31.495 --> 48:32.646
Yes, sometimes it's just a movie.

48:32.746 --> 48:34.706
It's never just a song!
It's never just a book.

48:35.082 --> 48:36.917
I don't care what Michelle Obama says.

48:37.417 --> 48:38.961
I'm like, fry or die.

48:40.170 --> 48:41.238
Give me some fries.

48:41.338 --> 48:42.489
I thought you didn't want none.

48:42.589 --> 48:44.091
Fry or die.

48:48.512 --> 48:51.181
Now, do you always keep
hot sauce in your bag?

48:51.682 --> 48:53.350
Yeah, I like my shit hot.

48:53.684 --> 48:57.020
In my apartment, I keep a bottle
in every room, like smoke detectors.

48:57.396 --> 49:00.774
Hammy! Hammy! Hammy! Hammy!

49:01.024 --> 49:02.526
Jump in already!

49:02.734 --> 49:04.236
Come on, hurry up!

49:05.153 --> 49:06.238
Hey!

49:10.868 --> 49:11.977
Bill Murray?

49:12.077 --> 49:13.412
Bill Murray's like,

49:13.954 --> 49:16.273
you know, perhaps top three

49:16.373 --> 49:18.458
funniest human beings
to ever walk the earth.

49:19.042 --> 49:21.361
And the guy you most likely
want to hang out with

49:21.461 --> 49:23.447
and drop his name, like,
"Yeah, I know Bill Murray.

49:23.547 --> 49:24.865
"I was just talking to Bill Murray
the other day."

49:24.965 --> 49:27.050
- Charlie Chaplin?
- Charlie Chaplin.

49:27.301 --> 49:29.970
He started this shit.
He's the KRS-One of comedy.

49:31.138 --> 49:32.139
The KRS-One.

49:32.264 --> 49:34.266
He's the Grandmaster Flash of ha-ha.

49:34.391 --> 49:35.626
I don't think people
actually read Capote.

49:35.726 --> 49:36.835
That's one of my tests to people.

49:36.935 --> 49:38.504
I say that and they're like, "Yeah,

49:38.604 --> 49:41.215
"you know, I really loved
Breakfast at Tiffany's."

49:41.315 --> 49:43.300
And I'm like, "You haven't read
Truman Capote. Stop."

49:43.400 --> 49:45.469
Bill Cosby is the greatest storyteller.

49:45.569 --> 49:46.929
- Richard Pryor?
- Richard Pryor is like

49:47.029 --> 49:48.263
the most honest human being.

49:48.363 --> 49:51.141
Even Jesus
didn't tell his followers everything.

49:51.241 --> 49:52.309
Like Rich...

49:52.409 --> 49:53.435
Eddie Murphy.

49:53.535 --> 49:57.981
I once saw Murphy and Michael Jackson
within two months of each other,

49:58.081 --> 49:59.358
and Eddie was better.

49:59.458 --> 50:00.859
- Love in the Time of Cholera.
- Yes, yes.

50:00.959 --> 50:04.213
And he says, "Too much love
is as bad for this as no love at all."

50:04.338 --> 50:05.506
That kind of broke my heart.

50:05.631 --> 50:08.300
Yeah, I mean, it's hard to
fuck somebody on a pedestal.

50:23.982 --> 50:26.009
- Beautiful. Taraji!
- Andre!

50:26.109 --> 50:27.194
Gabby, over here!

50:27.319 --> 50:28.887
- This way, Gabby!
- Hammy, this way!

50:28.987 --> 50:30.489
Andre, over to the right.

50:30.614 --> 50:32.115
Big smile, Gabby.

50:33.867 --> 50:35.202
Married.

50:38.080 --> 50:40.415
You're getting married, huh?

50:40.624 --> 50:42.125
You couldn't tell me?

50:43.126 --> 50:44.862
Can I get you two to smile?

50:44.962 --> 50:46.739
Thank you. Thank you very much.

50:46.839 --> 50:47.840
Taraji, this way.

50:51.885 --> 50:56.874
How can you keep your private life
separate from your public life

50:56.974 --> 50:59.251
when you're going through
something this weekend

50:59.351 --> 51:00.519
which combines the two?

51:00.644 --> 51:05.190
Your upcoming marriage
is getting more press than this movie.

51:05.566 --> 51:07.593
I mean, I'm watching,
like, television...

51:07.693 --> 51:10.053
Everybody's talking about that.
Nobody's talking about this.

51:10.153 --> 51:11.388
Can we talk about the movie?

51:11.488 --> 51:13.490
What kind of ratings
do you think you're gonna get?

51:13.949 --> 51:15.017
I was hoping for a little more comedy.

51:15.117 --> 51:16.994
Okay, you got two minutes, everybody.
Two minutes.

51:17.286 --> 51:18.645
Do you think they only wanna see you...

51:18.745 --> 51:21.273
You maybe stereotyped yourself
and, you know,

51:21.373 --> 51:23.166
that people don't wanna accept you
in a serious role?

51:23.375 --> 51:24.710
We want to see you funny.

51:25.335 --> 51:28.197
I already told you.
I ain't got time for your bullshit, Silk.

51:28.297 --> 51:29.423
I'm seeing somebody.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.925
Hey, no problem. Come on.

51:32.759 --> 51:34.511
If you don't get the fuck out my face...

51:37.723 --> 51:39.016
How do you think it went?

51:40.100 --> 51:42.853
The press was all over the place.
I'm just glad they showed up.

51:42.978 --> 51:45.756
I mean, honestly,
the most important thing right now

51:45.856 --> 51:47.508
is that people come out
and see the movie.

51:47.608 --> 51:48.926
You mean,
the most important thing isn't

51:49.026 --> 51:50.469
the "Wedding Spectacular Spectacular"?

51:50.569 --> 51:51.904
I did not say that.

51:52.487 --> 51:53.847
Okay, so you don't wanna be funny.

51:53.947 --> 51:55.182
Excuse me.

51:55.282 --> 51:56.950
So, you don't wanna make
funny movies anymore.

51:58.118 --> 52:00.687
And they don't want to take
your "serious" seriously.

52:00.787 --> 52:01.788
I'm sorry.

52:02.122 --> 52:05.375
So why not embrace
the wedding spectacle?

52:06.043 --> 52:09.505
I'm a guy, come on.
I didn't grow up dreaming of a wedding.

52:09.713 --> 52:12.491
There's no Grooms magazine.
They don't have a groomal registry.

52:12.591 --> 52:14.368
Weddings aren't for guys.

52:14.468 --> 52:16.929
I'm not talking about guys.
I'm talking about you.

52:17.054 --> 52:18.889
Why don't you embrace it?

52:19.056 --> 52:21.183
If you hate it so much,
why are you even doing it?

52:22.684 --> 52:24.603
Erica helped me get clean.

52:30.067 --> 52:31.693
I don't have time for this, Dre.

52:32.903 --> 52:34.696
I'm not gonna be your audience.

52:37.199 --> 52:38.575
"I'm not gonna be your audience"?

52:38.909 --> 52:40.786
Audience to my bullshit.

52:42.412 --> 52:44.164
If you don't have an audience,
it's hard to put on a show.

52:46.291 --> 52:47.459
Brad?

52:47.626 --> 52:49.920
Hey.

52:50.379 --> 52:52.756
- Happy birthday. Oh, my God.
- Thank you.

52:54.091 --> 52:56.076
How are you? I tried calling you all day.
I was so worried.

52:56.176 --> 52:58.954
Yeah, yeah... No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I was just in meetings.

52:59.054 --> 53:00.430
Hey, Andre Allen!

53:00.722 --> 53:02.182
Hey! White Brad!

53:02.432 --> 53:03.433
Happy birthday.

53:03.559 --> 53:05.769
Thank you, man.
I cannot wait to see the movie.

53:06.061 --> 53:08.355
I'm so glad somebody's
finally telling Boukman's story.

53:08.480 --> 53:10.482
I mean, no one talks about
the Maroon slaves.

53:10.607 --> 53:12.192
I know, they're so overlooked.

53:12.484 --> 53:13.819
- It's crazy.
- It's crazy.

53:14.152 --> 53:17.155
Okay, so what have you
been doing all day?

53:17.281 --> 53:19.783
Well, it's my birthday.
You know, I've been treating myself.

53:20.534 --> 53:23.312
Went uptown, did a little shopping,
didn't find anything.

53:23.412 --> 53:24.788
What are you doing here?

53:25.497 --> 53:26.940
I just was, like, going to check out

53:27.040 --> 53:29.068
the gift shop. 'Cause you never know...

53:29.168 --> 53:30.169
Is that Ryan?

53:31.170 --> 53:32.504
Yeah, Ryan's here.

53:32.880 --> 53:33.864
Hey, Ryan!

53:33.964 --> 53:36.158
Ryan, look who I ran into.

53:36.258 --> 53:38.302
Hey, Chelsea. How's it going, guys?

53:39.803 --> 53:41.597
I'm also here because Ryan,

53:42.222 --> 53:44.208
was just showing me the lounge here

53:44.308 --> 53:46.018
because he knows
the manager of the hotel

53:46.143 --> 53:48.604
and he's thinking maybe
I could be spinning here soon, so...

53:49.146 --> 53:50.981
And that's why you couldn't contact me?

53:51.523 --> 53:55.819
My phone is, like, going nuts lately.

53:55.986 --> 53:58.238
I don't know what's going on.
I'm changing plans.

53:59.990 --> 54:02.117
Is he wearing the shirt
that I bought you?

54:02.951 --> 54:04.953
I have to go.

54:07.206 --> 54:08.357
Look, I was gonna call you, okay?

54:08.457 --> 54:10.792
How much longer are you guys
gonna be doing this thing?

54:12.294 --> 54:14.129
I think you should go after him.

54:38.987 --> 54:40.697
Look, it's Hammy!

54:47.871 --> 54:49.498
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

54:50.040 --> 54:51.458
Hey, you okay?

54:52.709 --> 54:54.211
Yeah. No.

54:54.753 --> 54:55.879
I'm...

54:56.338 --> 54:58.757
I'm going to call my sponsor, okay?
I'm sorry.

54:59.508 --> 55:01.285
Just because he had a room key

55:01.385 --> 55:03.620
and was wearing a shirt
you bought Brad,

55:03.720 --> 55:05.581
that doesn't mean anything.

55:05.681 --> 55:09.184
I mean, guys trade clothes
in hotel rooms all the time.

55:09.560 --> 55:11.395
Maybe it was chilly,
you know what I mean?

55:11.562 --> 55:14.231
Maybe they called up each other...
"Hey, man, I'm freezing."

55:14.648 --> 55:15.632
"Me, too.

55:15.732 --> 55:19.152
"Why don't you meet me at a hotel
so we can switch clothes?"

55:19.653 --> 55:23.949
Kelly? Can I... I need to talk to you.
Please. Thank you.

55:25.909 --> 55:27.077
Great.

55:27.244 --> 55:30.455
I can say I've dated every race,
and now I've dated gay.

55:31.123 --> 55:32.249
Asian?

55:32.583 --> 55:33.917
Yes, Asian.

55:34.877 --> 55:36.837
Karate Asian or nerdy Asian?

55:37.129 --> 55:39.590
Asian-Asian.
You know, there's a billion Chinese.

55:39.715 --> 55:42.926
I think it's proven that their dicks work.
Yeah.

55:43.468 --> 55:45.721
I've dated married.
I've had a girlfriend.

55:46.305 --> 55:47.639
Two girlfriends.

55:47.806 --> 55:52.186
Okay, so you can go all k.d. lang,
but if he's with one guy, he's gay.

55:52.394 --> 55:53.921
Whatever, I don't make up the rules.
Who cares?

55:54.021 --> 55:55.898
It's not about that.
That's not the point.

55:56.106 --> 55:58.817
You know, stuff like this
doesn't come out of the blue.

55:59.568 --> 56:01.737
There must have been some sort of sign.

56:02.446 --> 56:03.614
I'm not gonna tell you.

56:03.780 --> 56:05.616
- Come on, tell me something.
- I'm not telling you.

56:06.158 --> 56:08.994
Come on, Teen Mom. Let it out.

56:13.624 --> 56:15.626
Okay, so we had a normal sex life.

56:21.131 --> 56:23.467
Then one day, out of the blue...

56:23.926 --> 56:25.244
Put a finger in my ass.

56:25.344 --> 56:26.578
You know, I'd never done that before.

56:26.678 --> 56:28.831
I didn't want to do it.
Like, this was not my thing,

56:28.931 --> 56:30.249
and luckily, no one
had ever asked me before,

56:30.349 --> 56:31.475
so it never really came up.

56:32.142 --> 56:33.435
But he asked me.

56:33.810 --> 56:36.104
And then my grandmamma
popped into my brain.

56:36.647 --> 56:38.982
Whatever he wants you to do

56:39.149 --> 56:40.317
you better do it.

56:40.484 --> 56:42.819
Or some other bitch will.

56:43.028 --> 56:44.363
I like your grandma.

56:44.863 --> 56:47.741
So I did it and he liked it.

56:50.244 --> 56:52.162
Oh, yes. That's it.

56:52.287 --> 56:54.039
- Like that?
- Yeah, yeah.

56:54.164 --> 56:56.917
In a weird way, I was happy
to be doing something he liked.

56:57.084 --> 56:59.545
But then he wanted it all the time.
Everywhere.

57:00.170 --> 57:01.380
On a plane.

57:01.505 --> 57:03.157
Go another knuck. Knuck it up, girl.

57:03.257 --> 57:04.675
- Knuck it up.
- Yeah? Yeah?

57:08.720 --> 57:10.247
At my friend's party.

57:10.347 --> 57:12.099
Yes, yes, yes!

57:12.432 --> 57:15.602
What's my motherfuckin' name? Jigga!

57:17.020 --> 57:18.605
Pretty soon, that's all he wanted.

57:18.897 --> 57:22.593
So one night, we're at dinner
with Ryan and his "girlfriend."

57:22.693 --> 57:24.428
So, Chels, you've been
looking for a place, right?

57:24.528 --> 57:25.596
What's been going on with that?

57:25.696 --> 57:30.158
Yeah. I'd like to buy a house, you know,
but everything's still so expensive.

57:30.367 --> 57:32.035
I thought the market was down.

57:32.327 --> 57:33.662
Babe, are you kidding?

57:33.871 --> 57:37.374
With your credit, you couldn't get a loan
if Bill Gates cosigned it.

57:39.209 --> 57:40.460
Good one!

57:41.628 --> 57:43.964
Hey, Alexa, how's your place
down in Costa Rica doing?

57:44.339 --> 57:46.466
Wait a second.
You got a place in Costa Rica?

57:46.675 --> 57:49.453
I felt completely humiliated,
but it was, you know, just let it go.

57:49.553 --> 57:51.388
It's not a big deal.
You know, you're bigger than that.

57:51.680 --> 57:52.790
You got a babysitter.

57:52.890 --> 57:54.558
We can have make-up sex.
It's gonna be fine.

58:07.571 --> 58:09.056
What? What?

58:09.156 --> 58:10.657
I have to go to the bathroom.

58:10.866 --> 58:13.243
Okay. All right, go, go, go. Go.

58:23.587 --> 58:26.924
I think it's dance night, baby.
You ready?

58:29.134 --> 58:30.469
You know I am.

58:32.262 --> 58:33.889
Come give Papa what he needs.

58:35.682 --> 58:37.851
I looked at his ass,
just stuck up in the air.

58:38.101 --> 58:40.646
And I thought about what he did.

58:41.396 --> 58:42.731
Good one!

58:47.319 --> 58:49.613
If Bill Gates cosigned you.

58:49.947 --> 58:52.783
I don't know, something just snapped.

58:54.451 --> 58:57.162
I reached into my purse
and pulled out a tampon.

58:57.746 --> 58:59.081
Then I pulled out my hot sauce.

58:59.456 --> 59:00.457
No, no!

59:01.625 --> 59:02.960
Don't say it!

59:03.627 --> 59:04.795
And I...

59:04.920 --> 59:05.963
Don't say it!

59:06.088 --> 59:07.297
I shoved it up his ass.

59:09.925 --> 59:11.635
What is that?

59:15.264 --> 59:16.206
Yup.

59:16.306 --> 59:18.058
Why? Why?

59:18.559 --> 59:21.144
Why are you doing this to me?
Take it out of here now!

59:21.311 --> 59:23.939
Hey, smartass,
I don't hear you laughing now!

59:29.945 --> 59:31.905
He's such an asshole!

59:33.448 --> 59:34.700
What are we doing?

59:50.924 --> 59:54.386
You know, Grace really loves him.
Like, a lot.

59:55.554 --> 59:57.347
And then he's just gonna be gone.

01:00:00.893 --> 01:00:02.561
What am I supposed to tell her?

01:00:03.145 --> 01:00:04.897
Just tell her the truth.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.734
I mean, you don't want her to think
she's supposed to stay with some guy

01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:11.069
out of some false sense of obligation.

01:00:11.987 --> 01:00:14.114
She's gonna see her mom fall down

01:00:14.323 --> 01:00:17.034
and then she's gonna see her mom
pick herself back up.

01:00:17.534 --> 01:00:20.204
No, what she's going to see is her mom

01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:24.249
having paraded yet another dude
through the house who's a loser!

01:00:33.675 --> 01:00:36.178
Oh, my God. My favorite.

01:00:36.553 --> 01:00:37.930
My favorite.

01:00:43.268 --> 01:00:44.561
You're right.

01:00:45.521 --> 01:00:48.982
I'm just going to have to
start the process again

01:00:49.107 --> 01:00:50.943
of vetting another dick.

01:00:52.653 --> 01:00:54.947
You're not gonna have a hard time
meeting anybody, come on.

01:00:55.447 --> 01:00:57.641
I mean, you're smart, you're beautiful.

01:00:57.741 --> 01:00:59.643
I'm really not fishing
for compliments right now.

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:01.286
No, no. I'm serious.

01:01:01.745 --> 01:01:02.996
I am, too.

01:01:03.163 --> 01:01:04.498
You're beautiful.

01:01:05.582 --> 01:01:06.917
You know that, right?

01:01:08.794 --> 01:01:10.462
Can we get out of here?

01:01:17.553 --> 01:01:20.222
What happened after that? What,
you just went to brunch after that?

01:01:20.722 --> 01:01:24.376
Yes, as a matter of fact.
We didn't even talk about it.

01:01:24.476 --> 01:01:27.337
I thought we were breaking up,
but apparently not, you know.

01:01:27.437 --> 01:01:28.922
And that's why
I've been feeling so guilty,

01:01:29.022 --> 01:01:30.257
and texting him and calling him all day

01:01:30.357 --> 01:01:31.800
and trying to figure out
what to do with his birthday.

01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:33.510
Come on,
he's not gonna break up over that.

01:01:33.610 --> 01:01:34.595
Why not?

01:01:34.695 --> 01:01:36.305
'Cause what's
he supposed to tell people?

01:01:36.405 --> 01:01:38.223
"Yeah, we broke up 'cause my girlfriend

01:01:38.323 --> 01:01:40.434
"shoved a red hot chili pepper
up my ass."

01:01:40.534 --> 01:01:41.602
No, no, no.

01:01:41.702 --> 01:01:44.855
He's gonna wait to do something
like cheat on you or hit you.

01:01:44.955 --> 01:01:46.565
You know,
like, a nice respectable break-up.

01:01:46.665 --> 01:01:48.567
- Hit me? Hit me?
- Not...

01:01:48.667 --> 01:01:50.961
Something respectable
like cheat on me or hit me.

01:01:51.336 --> 01:01:53.864
So basically, what you're saying
is that you're taking his side.

01:01:53.964 --> 01:01:55.574
- I'm not taking his side. I mean...
- Awesome.

01:01:55.674 --> 01:01:57.451
- Clearly you are.
- Come on. Come on.

01:01:57.551 --> 01:01:58.619
You're saying it's my fault.

01:01:58.719 --> 01:02:00.537
I can't believe
you didn't see this shit.

01:02:00.637 --> 01:02:02.414
I mean, he was wrong, okay?
He was wrong.

01:02:02.514 --> 01:02:04.641
But he wasn't burning-ass wrong.

01:02:05.017 --> 01:02:07.811
See, that's why
I didn't want to tell you.

01:02:07.978 --> 01:02:10.422
I open up to you and you laugh at me.

01:02:10.522 --> 01:02:12.341
- It's funny.
- It's not funny!

01:02:12.441 --> 01:02:14.176
What's funny about being cheated on?

01:02:14.276 --> 01:02:16.470
Come on. If you think
this is just about cheating,

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:18.447
then you're very naive.

01:02:19.406 --> 01:02:21.617
Naive? I'm naive?

01:02:22.951 --> 01:02:26.288
Mr. "The network picks out my rings."

01:02:26.496 --> 01:02:29.733
Mr. "I owe somebody a wedding."

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:30.818
I'm naive?

01:02:30.918 --> 01:02:33.404
Okay, first of all, you don't know me...

01:02:33.504 --> 01:02:34.488
You know "naive" well.

01:02:34.588 --> 01:02:38.909
Miss "I used my boyfriend's ass
as a hand puppet." Yeah, yeah.

01:02:39.009 --> 01:02:42.079
I don't need to know you
to know that something is wrong.

01:02:42.179 --> 01:02:44.014
Why do you even care, okay?

01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:45.807
Why don't you care?

01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:47.851
Can we just talk about my movie?

01:02:48.519 --> 01:02:50.687
Fuck your shitty movie!

01:03:10.457 --> 01:03:11.708
We should stop.

01:03:12.543 --> 01:03:13.544
What the fuck are we doing?

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.714
We gotta get out of here.

01:03:18.131 --> 01:03:19.383
Yes.

01:03:20.342 --> 01:03:22.553
- But first...
- What?

01:03:22.678 --> 01:03:24.680
You gotta get your hands out my pants.

01:03:25.264 --> 01:03:27.291
You gotta get your hands
out of my pants.

01:03:27.391 --> 01:03:29.226
- You first.
- You first.

01:03:30.936 --> 01:03:32.212
Okay, on three.

01:03:32.312 --> 01:03:34.006
Okay. At the same time.

01:03:34.106 --> 01:03:35.466
- Same time.
- Okay.

01:03:35.566 --> 01:03:37.150
Same time, motherfucker.

01:03:37.734 --> 01:03:39.236
One,

01:03:39.486 --> 01:03:40.863
two,

01:03:42.573 --> 01:03:43.699
three.

01:03:48.203 --> 01:03:49.872
Goddamn.

01:03:53.208 --> 01:03:54.334
Okay.

01:03:59.923 --> 01:04:01.800
We should get out of here?

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.996
Yeah, yeah, but you go first.

01:04:06.096 --> 01:04:08.724
We can't get out of here
at the same time.

01:04:10.350 --> 01:04:11.894
Okay, I mean, you know...

01:04:13.061 --> 01:04:15.063
Remember, nothing happened, right?

01:04:15.439 --> 01:04:17.007
Yeah, like, just because we didn't fuck

01:04:17.107 --> 01:04:18.467
it doesn't mean
that we didn't fuck around.

01:04:18.567 --> 01:04:22.863
So you go first and then I'll come out
in a couple seconds. A couple minutes.

01:04:24.114 --> 01:04:26.433
Okay, so I'm going to get out of here.

01:04:26.533 --> 01:04:28.285
- Okay.
- I gotta make a call anyway.

01:04:30.245 --> 01:04:33.415
Shit, my phone's dead.
I gotta call fucking London.

01:04:35.626 --> 01:04:37.002
Here, use mine.

01:04:37.794 --> 01:04:38.795
Okay.

01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:43.300
Code, 1999.

01:04:43.634 --> 01:04:44.843
Thanks.

01:04:49.056 --> 01:04:50.207
Yo, yo, Silk.

01:04:50.307 --> 01:04:51.750
You're Hammy the Bear!

01:04:51.850 --> 01:04:55.187
Yeah, yeah, have him pick me up
at the Coffee Shop.

01:04:55.312 --> 01:04:56.647
Yeah, Union Square.

01:04:57.272 --> 01:04:59.191
Two iced coffees!

01:05:03.987 --> 01:05:05.322
Hammy!

01:05:22.464 --> 01:05:24.466
Hammy, I love you, man!

01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:46.780
What the fuck?

01:05:47.239 --> 01:05:49.575
Chelsea is James Nielson?

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:53.161
Why, 'cause your boy James Nielson
said he wouldn't watch my next movie

01:05:53.287 --> 01:05:54.663
if it was playing in his glasses?

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:56.290
James.

01:06:04.173 --> 01:06:05.883
I love you, Andre!

01:06:07.551 --> 01:06:08.677
Andre!

01:06:09.303 --> 01:06:11.388
Oh, my God, it's Andre Allen!

01:06:12.139 --> 01:06:14.057
When are you gonna do
another Hammy movie?

01:06:16.476 --> 01:06:18.228
Your boss is looking for you.

01:06:20.022 --> 01:06:21.315
Okay.

01:06:24.651 --> 01:06:26.904
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:06:32.743 --> 01:06:34.536
You're James Nielson.

01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:36.413
Were you going through my phone?

01:06:36.663 --> 01:06:38.832
I went through your phone
looking for naked pictures.

01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:40.250
That's going through my phone.

01:06:40.375 --> 01:06:43.670
That's beside the point.
You're James Nielson.

01:06:45.422 --> 01:06:46.924
It's not what you think.

01:06:47.382 --> 01:06:50.160
You trashed me for years.

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:53.263
And then you hang around me
like you're my friend?

01:06:53.597 --> 01:06:54.665
I'm sorry.

01:06:54.765 --> 01:06:56.959
I've been wanting to say something
all day, I just didn't know how.

01:06:57.059 --> 01:07:00.712
Shut the fuck up.
Now you're lying on top of your lies.

01:07:00.812 --> 01:07:02.648
- I'm not lying.
- You're lying.

01:07:02.773 --> 01:07:04.925
I remember
in one of your reviews, you go,

01:07:05.025 --> 01:07:06.735
"O.J.'s been brought to justice.

01:07:06.944 --> 01:07:09.279
"Bin Laden's been brought to justice.

01:07:09.446 --> 01:07:12.391
"When will Andre Allen
be brought to justice

01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:15.118
"for his crimes against humanity?"

01:07:16.745 --> 01:07:18.997
My mother read that shit.

01:07:22.334 --> 01:07:23.961
Andre Allen.

01:07:26.296 --> 01:07:27.297
Andre?

01:07:28.006 --> 01:07:29.341
Hammy!

01:07:34.847 --> 01:07:35.931
Andre.

01:07:37.307 --> 01:07:38.542
Okay, maybe I took it too far.

01:07:38.642 --> 01:07:39.810
You think?

01:07:40.477 --> 01:07:41.478
Yeah.

01:07:42.604 --> 01:07:44.606
I was so happy 10 minutes ago.

01:07:44.815 --> 01:07:45.941
Me, too.

01:07:46.441 --> 01:07:48.218
- You told me you were in the program.
- I am.

01:07:48.318 --> 01:07:49.553
You're not in the program.

01:07:49.653 --> 01:07:50.988
I am. That's the truth.

01:07:51.363 --> 01:07:53.015
What do they tell you in the program?

01:07:53.115 --> 01:07:55.517
What do they tell us?
"Rigorous honesty."

01:07:55.617 --> 01:07:56.560
I know.

01:07:56.660 --> 01:07:59.246
- Rigorous fucking honesty.
- I know.

01:08:00.747 --> 01:08:03.292
You wanna know why
I won't make any funny movies?

01:08:03.709 --> 01:08:05.210
'Cause I never did it clean.

01:08:06.962 --> 01:08:10.174
Every time you ever seen me be funny,
I was drunk or high, or both.

01:08:10.382 --> 01:08:13.302
Every time. Every show.
I was fucked up.

01:08:13.802 --> 01:08:15.579
And now people want me to be funny.

01:08:15.679 --> 01:08:17.973
And you know what?
I don't know if I can do it.

01:08:20.017 --> 01:08:21.350
And I'm scared.

01:08:21.852 --> 01:08:24.062
I am scared.

01:08:25.689 --> 01:08:27.024
Rigorous honesty.

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:52.799
The wedding is tracking like crazy.
There are no more ads to buy.

01:08:53.008 --> 01:08:55.719
You sure you can't talk him
into doing a few more receptions?

01:08:56.678 --> 01:08:58.122
No, I don't think so.

01:08:58.221 --> 01:09:01.250
But I'm pretty sure I can sell him
on more honeymoon stuff.

01:09:01.350 --> 01:09:03.393
Don't worry. I'll get him on board.

01:09:03.935 --> 01:09:05.562
How's the movie tracking?

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:11.801
- So, what's the line for?
- Boo.

01:09:11.902 --> 01:09:12.970
What's that?

01:09:13.069 --> 01:09:14.638
It's the new Tyler Perry movie.

01:09:14.738 --> 01:09:17.241
It's where Madea
gets trapped in a haunted house.

01:09:17.366 --> 01:09:19.368
- It's doing great.
- Yo, Hammy!

01:09:19.535 --> 01:09:21.078
Good for him. So, how am I doing?

01:09:33.131 --> 01:09:35.216
So how's it playing
on the other screens?

01:09:35.551 --> 01:09:37.636
This is the only screen it's playing on.

01:09:59.950 --> 01:10:01.118
Stop here.

01:11:09.978 --> 01:11:10.979
Yeah.

01:11:19.863 --> 01:11:22.015
Hey, yo, man, you mind if I get
a picture with you real quick, man?

01:11:22.115 --> 01:11:24.226
I'm a big fan of your movies.
I love all of it, man.

01:11:24.326 --> 01:11:26.370
Not right now, man, not right now.

01:11:27.829 --> 01:11:29.873
Come on, let me get
one picture with you.

01:11:34.169 --> 01:11:35.504
Hey, what's that?

01:11:44.429 --> 01:11:45.639
Hey!

01:11:46.890 --> 01:11:48.600
Hammy the fucking beer?

01:11:50.394 --> 01:11:51.436
Fuck you, Hammy!

01:11:52.938 --> 01:11:54.648
Hammy the fucking beer?

01:12:03.574 --> 01:12:04.616
No!

01:12:04.741 --> 01:12:06.243
- I need you to relax.
- Get away from me!

01:12:10.539 --> 01:12:11.623
Come on!

01:12:19.423 --> 01:12:20.591
Hammy!

01:12:21.258 --> 01:12:22.801
Wassup, Ham?

01:12:23.177 --> 01:12:24.469
You saw me, man. You heard me.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:27.097
Hammy!

01:12:27.222 --> 01:12:30.392
...when he flew into a wild rage
at a grocery store in Manhattan.

01:12:31.602 --> 01:12:33.520
Out, please. Thank you.

01:12:34.938 --> 01:12:38.108
Can we clear the room, please?
Quickly, thank you.

01:12:38.358 --> 01:12:40.194
- Thank you.
- All right, let's go.

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:45.824
Dre?

01:12:46.783 --> 01:12:48.452
Hey, hey.

01:12:49.119 --> 01:12:51.622
I cannot believe you did this to me.

01:12:51.872 --> 01:12:54.958
Are you kidding me?
Right before our wedding? Really?

01:12:55.292 --> 01:12:58.921
It is on CNN, Fox, TMZ,
Media fucking TakeOut!

01:12:59.463 --> 01:13:01.407
As soon as I get out of here,
I'm gonna come right to you.

01:13:01.507 --> 01:13:03.158
No, no, no.
You're not gonna come to me.

01:13:03.258 --> 01:13:05.385
You're gonna go
to your fucking bachelor party!

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:06.970
You can still make this right, Dre.

01:13:07.971 --> 01:13:10.474
I'm an alcoholic. I'm a fucking drunk.

01:13:10.766 --> 01:13:13.977
Do you really think
I need to go to a party?

01:13:14.269 --> 01:13:15.604
You have to do this.

01:13:15.896 --> 01:13:17.923
Did you forget who the fuck I am?

01:13:18.023 --> 01:13:19.967
I turned down Bradley Cooper!

01:13:20.067 --> 01:13:22.110
Matt Kemp! Matt fucking Kemp!

01:13:22.444 --> 01:13:24.613
I could have had anybody!

01:13:25.155 --> 01:13:26.615
I chose you, Dre.

01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:29.618
Everybody wanted to wife me,
and I chose you.

01:13:30.035 --> 01:13:31.370
Dre, what do I do?

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:35.249
Every time I see you after
we've been separated, what do I do?

01:13:35.499 --> 01:13:36.750
We have sex?

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.419
No, no, no. Not just sex.

01:13:40.212 --> 01:13:42.656
After every time
we have been separated,

01:13:42.756 --> 01:13:44.508
the moment I see you,

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:47.010
the second you walk through the door,

01:13:47.344 --> 01:13:49.346
I suck your dick! Every time!

01:13:49.513 --> 01:13:51.682
Do you think I wanted to do that? Dre?

01:13:52.683 --> 01:13:55.519
I didn't know
you were keeping a blowjob tab.

01:13:55.686 --> 01:13:58.188
That's not what I'm saying.
What I am saying, Dre,

01:13:58.355 --> 01:14:01.525
is that I sucked your dick for us!

01:14:01.942 --> 01:14:05.487
I sucked it for us
because I knew, sooner or later,

01:14:05.654 --> 01:14:08.223
I was gonna need you
to do something for me

01:14:08.323 --> 01:14:09.908
that you didn't want to do.

01:14:10.409 --> 01:14:11.869
You owe me.

01:14:12.578 --> 01:14:14.329
Do you hear yourself?

01:14:14.705 --> 01:14:16.665
You're addicted to this shit.

01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:20.544
See, what you're not understanding,

01:14:21.253 --> 01:14:23.088
this is all I have.

01:14:24.423 --> 01:14:27.384
Okay? I don't have a talent.

01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:30.579
Right? I don't sing.

01:14:30.679 --> 01:14:33.957
I don't dance. I don't act.
I don't tell jokes.

01:14:34.057 --> 01:14:36.059
I'm not you, Dre.

01:14:38.312 --> 01:14:40.464
You have to... You have to choose me.

01:14:40.564 --> 01:14:41.673
Erica?

01:14:41.773 --> 01:14:43.734
Okay?
Everyone needs to see you choose me.

01:14:43.859 --> 01:14:45.569
- Erica.
- I am finally famous.

01:14:45.694 --> 01:14:47.029
Don't ruin this for me!

01:14:47.404 --> 01:14:49.489
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.

01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:01.585
Don't say nothin'.

01:15:01.919 --> 01:15:04.129
Look at you. You look great.

01:15:04.671 --> 01:15:07.758
Didn't I tell you?
These streets are dangerous. I said it.

01:15:09.468 --> 01:15:11.036
This reminds me of eighth grade.

01:15:11.136 --> 01:15:13.472
We got locked up for playing hooky.
Remember that?

01:15:14.556 --> 01:15:16.099
Don't say "we."

01:15:16.975 --> 01:15:18.519
The cops grabbed me.

01:15:19.311 --> 01:15:20.896
You let 'em catch you.

01:15:21.355 --> 01:15:24.483
What was I supposed to do,
let you get locked up by yourself?

01:15:26.485 --> 01:15:28.570
Dre, next time they give you one call,

01:15:30.239 --> 01:15:31.490
call me.

01:15:34.451 --> 01:15:36.453
Here's what you are going to do.

01:15:37.621 --> 01:15:40.165
You are going to attend
your bachelor party.

01:15:41.208 --> 01:15:42.901
And then you're going to
climb up on that jet

01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:45.462
and you, my man,
are going to get married.

01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:48.507
And then, and only then,

01:15:48.882 --> 01:15:50.701
I will make sure
that your little incident

01:15:50.801 --> 01:15:52.594
plays into the press
like it was part of the show.

01:15:52.803 --> 01:15:55.664
I will tell the media, the cops,
your parole officer,

01:15:55.764 --> 01:15:57.124
that we all thought
the alcohol was fake.

01:15:57.224 --> 01:15:59.059
Everybody knows
that these shows aren't real.

01:15:59.226 --> 01:16:01.979
But if you decide
to do something drastic,

01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:05.858
you are on your own.

01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:07.985
Your own.

01:16:13.031 --> 01:16:14.366
It's okay.

01:16:52.821 --> 01:16:56.158
Hey, young lady,
it is way past your bedtime.

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:58.869
Come on, two more minutes?
I got some more pigs to kill.

01:16:59.328 --> 01:17:00.746
Turn off Grandma's phone.

01:17:00.871 --> 01:17:02.581
It's not Grandma's. It's mine.

01:17:03.498 --> 01:17:04.708
Yours.

01:17:05.542 --> 01:17:06.835
Who gave you a phone?

01:17:07.211 --> 01:17:08.378
The Prince sent it.

01:17:14.009 --> 01:17:16.803
I got strict orders to have you
out of here in 45 minutes.

01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:18.263
Sorry about the movie.

01:17:18.430 --> 01:17:20.849
There's always word of mouth.
It could still be a hit!

01:17:21.141 --> 01:17:22.309
If you say so.

01:17:39.785 --> 01:17:41.119
You guys ever been here?

01:17:41.495 --> 01:17:42.996
I have not been here.

01:17:43.622 --> 01:17:47.067
No. My wife gave me 20 minutes
and said, "Get in, get out."

01:17:47.167 --> 01:17:48.168
We're not here now.

01:17:49.837 --> 01:17:51.530
Watch your pockets, too,
they will pick it.

01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:52.990
That's a guarantee. Not being racist.

01:17:53.090 --> 01:17:54.283
- That's being ho-ist.
- Who?

01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:56.885
Some of these chicks need money
and you fuckin' know it. Relax.

01:17:57.010 --> 01:17:58.428
You been here before, Whoopi?

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.848
Hey, Whoopi.

01:18:01.014 --> 01:18:02.040
Hi, Jasmine.

01:18:02.140 --> 01:18:03.208
Hi, Jerry.

01:18:03.308 --> 01:18:04.643
My niece.

01:18:05.018 --> 01:18:06.854
She goes to my temple.

01:18:07.896 --> 01:18:10.065
Whatever you do, don't get a mistress.

01:18:10.274 --> 01:18:11.675
Can't do it. You'll get caught.

01:18:11.775 --> 01:18:14.344
Just be a good person.
You can handle that. Just be good.

01:18:14.444 --> 01:18:15.637
Stay good to her.

01:18:15.737 --> 01:18:18.031
Stay true to her. Whack off.

01:18:18.532 --> 01:18:19.825
- Whack off.
- Whack off.

01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:21.118
Whack off.

01:18:21.618 --> 01:18:24.788
And if it does happen, do not confess.

01:18:25.247 --> 01:18:27.357
You will get caught. Just because...

01:18:27.457 --> 01:18:31.528
No matter what, even if she finds
an actual vagina in your pocket.

01:18:31.628 --> 01:18:33.297
- Don't confess.
- "I don't know how it got there."

01:18:33.505 --> 01:18:36.466
My wife found two pussies
in my glove compartment.

01:18:36.592 --> 01:18:39.803
And I had to convince her, you know,
it's a standard option on a Mercedes.

01:18:41.722 --> 01:18:44.391
You can lie as much as you want,
she's going to know.

01:18:44.516 --> 01:18:45.501
It takes a village.

01:18:45.601 --> 01:18:46.602
Don't cheat.

01:18:46.727 --> 01:18:47.853
I have no plans to cheat.

01:18:47.978 --> 01:18:49.021
I know, no one does.

01:18:49.146 --> 01:18:50.564
No one plans to speed.

01:18:51.481 --> 01:18:54.902
Biggie, Jay, Nas, Ghostface, Jadakiss.

01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:56.386
If you gonna say Gang Starr,

01:18:56.486 --> 01:18:58.806
then you need to say
C.L. Smooth, Pete Rock.

01:18:58.906 --> 01:19:00.908
You the one that picked
The Scenario over...

01:19:01.533 --> 01:19:02.643
What's the other one?

01:19:02.743 --> 01:19:04.453
- The Symphony.
- The Symphony.

01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:08.207
Fucking Scenario is better
than Symphony, nigga!

01:19:08.415 --> 01:19:09.917
Can I finish?

01:19:36.193 --> 01:19:37.428
So how you doing?

01:19:37.528 --> 01:19:40.764
I'm all right. I mean,
all that stuff that's on TV, that was...

01:19:40.864 --> 01:19:43.700
That was just for the show.
I'm not really drinking.

01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:47.746
Okay, I got married a lot of times.
You've been at several of my weddings.

01:19:48.038 --> 01:19:50.541
But I always knew
that wasn't what I was into.

01:19:50.666 --> 01:19:53.544
I wasn't into the wedding
and everyone knew it.

01:19:53.961 --> 01:19:57.464
I should have been into the guy.
As you should be into the girl.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.033
- Make her sign the prenup.
- Prenup.

01:20:00.133 --> 01:20:03.303
It's a hard conversation,
but just do it.

01:20:03.428 --> 01:20:05.222
You will be happy in the long run.

01:20:05.347 --> 01:20:06.582
- My money.
- Whose money is it?

01:20:06.682 --> 01:20:07.666
My money!

01:20:07.766 --> 01:20:09.543
- Who wrote the jokes?
- I wrote the jokes.

01:20:09.643 --> 01:20:11.854
Keep that fucking cash. Sign that shit.

01:20:12.104 --> 01:20:13.522
Did you get one?

01:20:14.398 --> 01:20:15.732
I did not.

01:20:15.858 --> 01:20:17.025
Fuck!

01:20:41.216 --> 01:20:43.494
Gonna go outside and check on the car.
Got a plane to catch.

01:20:43.594 --> 01:20:45.788
All right, hurry up.
We gotta get out of here.

01:20:45.888 --> 01:20:47.598
I'm on it! You know I'm on it.

01:20:49.766 --> 01:20:51.602
Hey, Andre, she really loved the phone.

01:20:55.022 --> 01:20:56.356
James Nielson!

01:20:57.983 --> 01:20:59.318
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:20:59.443 --> 01:21:01.486
- I don't want to talk to you, James.
- Please?

01:21:01.612 --> 01:21:03.822
No! I don't want to talk.
Hey, everybody!

01:21:04.448 --> 01:21:07.784
This man right here is a journalist!

01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:10.245
He is not to be trusted!

01:21:10.495 --> 01:21:12.164
Okay. I'm sorry.

01:21:12.581 --> 01:21:15.359
Okay, James is a character
I created a very long time ago,

01:21:15.459 --> 01:21:17.836
and unfortunately,
he's still a very popular character.

01:21:17.961 --> 01:21:20.797
Character?
What are you, Sasha Fierce?

01:21:20.964 --> 01:21:23.575
I got it. Shakira Simmons.

01:21:23.675 --> 01:21:25.010
- Shakara.
- Shakara Simmons.

01:21:25.135 --> 01:21:26.762
- Yeah.
- Who gives a fuck?

01:21:29.223 --> 01:21:30.916
- Was it all a lie?
- Of course not.

01:21:31.016 --> 01:21:32.434
Were you in character the whole time?

01:21:32.601 --> 01:21:33.769
No!

01:21:34.978 --> 01:21:36.355
Any of it?

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:39.441
Your mother, your kid.
Your Cinderella bullshit.

01:21:39.816 --> 01:21:44.112
I'm really sorry. What I did was wrong
and it was creepy and it was weird.

01:21:44.655 --> 01:21:45.806
And I know you won't believe me,

01:21:45.906 --> 01:21:48.725
but I actually did it because I like you.
All right?

01:21:48.825 --> 01:21:50.160
The fan in me just wanted to know

01:21:50.285 --> 01:21:52.062
what happened to that guy
that I saw at Purchase.

01:21:52.162 --> 01:21:53.188
You liked me?

01:21:53.288 --> 01:21:54.857
Yes, that made me laugh and cry.

01:21:54.957 --> 01:21:56.108
You can't touch the girls.

01:21:56.208 --> 01:21:59.111
She took my wallet. I don't know
where it is, but she has it.

01:21:59.211 --> 01:22:02.030
I don't have any clothes on.
Where am I gonna put it?

01:22:02.130 --> 01:22:03.882
Do I have to say it?

01:22:04.341 --> 01:22:06.677
We got drama. Come on. We gotta go.

01:22:07.135 --> 01:22:09.513
- Let's get out of here.
- Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

01:22:10.597 --> 01:22:11.682
Hey, Andre?

01:22:15.143 --> 01:22:16.812
Are you going my way?

01:22:29.032 --> 01:22:30.659
So are you okay, alky?

01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:36.081
Yeah, I'm real good.
It's not as bad as it looks.

01:22:39.209 --> 01:22:42.796
I got a Google alert that said
that the incident was part of the show.

01:22:43.547 --> 01:22:46.216
But I could tell
that you were really drinking.

01:22:46.383 --> 01:22:47.618
You're not that good of an actor.

01:22:47.718 --> 01:22:49.386
Nice one, James.

01:22:54.725 --> 01:22:56.226
Hey, where are we going?

01:22:56.602 --> 01:22:58.979
I thought we were just dropping her off.

01:22:59.396 --> 01:23:00.647
We're just making a little stop first.

01:23:01.231 --> 01:23:02.566
Stop where?

01:23:09.239 --> 01:23:10.407
Yo, come on.

01:23:14.369 --> 01:23:15.871
Thank you.

01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:21.026
I thought we'd just see a couple,

01:23:21.126 --> 01:23:23.504
and then, you know,
we can just get out of here.

01:23:25.255 --> 01:23:26.590
Yo, Hammy!

01:23:26.882 --> 01:23:28.383
Wassup, Hammy!

01:23:32.804 --> 01:23:34.139
What's happenin', man?

01:23:34.264 --> 01:23:35.916
- You going on?
- No, no.

01:23:36.016 --> 01:23:37.267
All right.

01:23:41.438 --> 01:23:42.673
Look around the room,
look around the room,

01:23:42.773 --> 01:23:45.676
look around the room,
any guy not laughing at that right now,

01:23:45.776 --> 01:23:46.944
is on a date.

01:23:48.403 --> 01:23:51.849
There is a battle going on at the table
between the man and the woman.

01:23:51.949 --> 01:23:53.283
- What's up, man?
- The man wants leverage.

01:23:53.408 --> 01:23:54.952
- How's it going?
- The woman wants leverage.

01:23:55.118 --> 01:23:57.771
See, when the check comes,
if the girl puts money on the table,

01:23:57.871 --> 01:23:59.790
that's called the "no pussy deposit."

01:24:01.625 --> 01:24:02.960
She just put a deposit down

01:24:03.085 --> 01:24:05.963
on not having to do shit with you later
on that night.

01:24:06.129 --> 01:24:08.198
You ever see how the girl,
when she drops the twenty,

01:24:08.298 --> 01:24:10.242
she holds her hand up
like she shot a three-pointer,

01:24:10.342 --> 01:24:12.135
then gets back on defense? Bam!

01:24:13.971 --> 01:24:16.749
Oh, my gosh, look at this outfit.
This is me trying.

01:24:16.849 --> 01:24:19.017
This is what you look like
when you start giving up.

01:24:19.184 --> 01:24:21.462
Take a note. People keep asking me
if I'm from Michigan.

01:24:21.562 --> 01:24:24.231
I'm like, "No, I'm done.
It looks the same."

01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:28.652
It looks exactly the fucking same.

01:24:28.861 --> 01:24:30.721
I don't wear anything
that doesn't transition well

01:24:30.821 --> 01:24:32.406
to bed from now on.

01:24:32.781 --> 01:24:35.617
If I can't pull the bra out the sleeve,
I'm not interested in you.

01:24:36.410 --> 01:24:37.703
I'm not interested.

01:24:37.911 --> 01:24:40.914
Yeah, how come every movie
with slaves always has that one scene?

01:24:51.341 --> 01:24:53.343
It's like... It's like Slave Idol.

01:25:00.184 --> 01:25:02.352
You guys ain't going to believe this.

01:25:02.853 --> 01:25:06.523
The one, the only, Andre Allen!

01:25:34.551 --> 01:25:36.553
What can I say?

01:25:37.054 --> 01:25:38.597
Please lower your expectations.

01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:42.559
It's not gonna be that good.

01:25:43.268 --> 01:25:47.397
What the hell am I doing up here?
I haven't done this in a long time.

01:25:48.065 --> 01:25:51.135
A lot of people don't like dates.
It's like, "I hate dating. I hate dating."

01:25:51.235 --> 01:25:53.403
I like dates. Dates are cool.

01:25:53.695 --> 01:25:57.241
'Cause a date means
someone is considering fucking you.

01:26:01.662 --> 01:26:03.956
They have to, like, ponder it.
It's just...

01:26:05.916 --> 01:26:09.878
Anybody you can eat with,
you might have a chance of fucking.

01:26:11.213 --> 01:26:14.049
So, and they're just pondering
fucking you.

01:26:14.591 --> 01:26:17.161
They're weighing it in their head.
They're going...

01:26:17.261 --> 01:26:20.722
Girls are going,
"His dick, my mouth. I wonder."

01:26:21.390 --> 01:26:24.726
And even if it doesn't happen,
you just feel... I feel good.

01:26:25.185 --> 01:26:28.981
I mean, any day somebody thinks
about fucking you is a good day.

01:26:30.649 --> 01:26:32.926
That's the thing with women.
Like... They don't...

01:26:33.026 --> 01:26:36.446
No matter what you do for a woman,
if it doesn't end in marriage,

01:26:37.114 --> 01:26:38.574
this was a waste of time.

01:26:38.782 --> 01:26:42.953
I don't care what you do for her.
You could... Got her a job,

01:26:43.829 --> 01:26:46.456
you know, cured her diabetes,

01:26:47.374 --> 01:26:49.084
taught her how to read.

01:26:49.543 --> 01:26:51.487
But if it's over
and you don't marry her,

01:26:51.587 --> 01:26:54.131
it's like, "I can't believe
I wasted my time with you."

01:26:54.339 --> 01:26:55.841
"Fuck you and your letters."

01:26:57.301 --> 01:27:00.262
"I could have been married
with diabetes by now."

01:27:02.097 --> 01:27:03.682
What can I say?

01:27:03.974 --> 01:27:08.604
All I can say is, don't make
any major decisions after a blowjob.

01:27:12.274 --> 01:27:14.943
You know, let the blowjob wear off.

01:27:16.820 --> 01:27:19.364
Then you figure out
what you want to do, you know.

01:27:19.615 --> 01:27:21.533
That's just my advice to you.

01:27:21.825 --> 01:27:24.186
I'm sure that's what
happened to J.F.K, you know.

01:27:24.286 --> 01:27:26.830
Marilyn Monroe gave him a blowjob and,

01:27:27.122 --> 01:27:29.958
you know, he was, like,
"I'm gonna get me a convertible."

01:27:39.092 --> 01:27:41.678
One more time! Andre Allen!

01:27:42.554 --> 01:27:44.415
- Come on. Hurry up!
- That was incredible!

01:27:44.515 --> 01:27:46.016
Hammy!

01:27:46.517 --> 01:27:48.435
- You still got it! I told you!
- Yes.

01:27:49.102 --> 01:27:51.588
- Amazing. Oh, my God.
- Get in there, get in there.

01:27:51.688 --> 01:27:52.940
Hammy, keep it real.

01:27:53.065 --> 01:27:54.258
Yo, Hammy.

01:27:54.358 --> 01:27:56.235
Come on, go, go, go, go!

01:27:57.528 --> 01:27:58.862
That was incredible!

01:27:59.196 --> 01:28:00.973
- Amazing. As always.
- Wasn't he amazing?

01:28:01.073 --> 01:28:02.282
You were amazing. You were so great.

01:28:07.037 --> 01:28:08.080
How do you feel?

01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:09.540
I feel...

01:28:09.873 --> 01:28:12.543
Insane, man! I feel like,

01:28:13.043 --> 01:28:17.214
you know, it's like I took the pill
and I'm in the Matrix.

01:28:17.422 --> 01:28:21.535
Like, I can't believe it.
I'm just watching the people.

01:28:21.635 --> 01:28:24.847
And I can hear them laugh,
and I could feel the laughter.

01:28:24.972 --> 01:28:27.808
Okay, what got you up there?
What did it?

01:28:28.725 --> 01:28:30.394
When I met you this morning,

01:28:30.644 --> 01:28:34.731
you mentioned this show that I did
at your school like 15 years ago.

01:28:35.357 --> 01:28:37.025
And I remembered it.

01:28:37.901 --> 01:28:39.152
It was a good show.

01:28:39.611 --> 01:28:40.946
It was.

01:28:41.864 --> 01:28:45.868
You just got me thinking
about being on stage.

01:28:48.412 --> 01:28:49.913
So, that's all it took, huh?

01:28:50.914 --> 01:28:52.249
That...

01:28:53.834 --> 01:28:55.169
...and jail.

01:28:56.753 --> 01:28:59.214
- Jail.
- You were barely in there.

01:29:00.757 --> 01:29:03.093
After I got off the phone with Erica,

01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.012
I thought I was at bottom.

01:29:05.429 --> 01:29:09.099
I was like, "This is it,
I have fucked up everything."

01:29:09.766 --> 01:29:13.478
And at that moment,
I heard this crazy sound.

01:29:29.453 --> 01:29:30.787
DMX.

01:29:31.955 --> 01:29:33.081
What are you doing here?

01:29:33.790 --> 01:29:35.959
Really? What am I doing here?

01:29:36.251 --> 01:29:38.170
I'm X, man.
I live in this motherfucker, man.

01:29:38.295 --> 01:29:39.296
Don't you watch the news?

01:29:39.922 --> 01:29:41.089
Damn, homie.

01:29:41.632 --> 01:29:44.760
I respect the fuck out of your shit, man.
Uprize?

01:29:45.302 --> 01:29:46.637
I'm gonna see that
as soon as I get out, man.

01:29:47.304 --> 01:29:50.641
Yo, man, thanks a lot, man.
I'm a big fan of yours, too.

01:29:51.141 --> 01:29:54.645
One thing I really respect about you,
why I fuck with you for real, son,

01:29:54.937 --> 01:29:57.940
is that you won't let the industry
box you in.

01:29:58.148 --> 01:29:59.983
We're pretty much
on some same shit, yo.

01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:02.319
I'm kind of tired of rapping, man.

01:30:02.653 --> 01:30:04.613
Plus, I got so much more to offer.

01:30:04.988 --> 01:30:08.325
That's what I always say, man.
I got so much more to offer.

01:30:08.825 --> 01:30:10.661
- You got a minute?
- Yeah.

01:30:10.953 --> 01:30:12.287
Check this out.

01:30:13.497 --> 01:30:16.500
Smile, though your heart is aching

01:30:17.292 --> 01:30:20.128
Smile, even though it's breaking

01:30:21.004 --> 01:30:23.173
When there are clouds in the sky

01:30:23.507 --> 01:30:25.008
You'll get by

01:30:25.342 --> 01:30:27.344
Smile through the pain and sorrow

01:30:27.469 --> 01:30:28.512
What?

01:30:28.846 --> 01:30:31.348
Smile and maybe tomorrow

01:30:31.682 --> 01:30:33.851
You'll see the sun come shining through

01:30:33.976 --> 01:30:34.918
For you

01:30:35.018 --> 01:30:36.061
Shut the fuck up!

01:30:36.186 --> 01:30:37.354
I'm expressing myself over here, nigga.

01:30:37.688 --> 01:30:40.257
Light up your face with gladness

01:30:40.357 --> 01:30:42.693
Hide every trace of sadness

01:30:43.026 --> 01:30:46.363
And although a tear is ever so near

01:30:46.697 --> 01:30:49.767
That's the time you must keep on trying

01:30:49.867 --> 01:30:51.185
Smile, what's the use of crying?

01:30:51.285 --> 01:30:52.269
You suck!

01:30:52.369 --> 01:30:55.038
You'll find that life
is still worthwhile

01:30:55.372 --> 01:30:58.208
If you just smile
Motherfucker!

01:30:58.709 --> 01:31:00.027
Shut the fuck up!

01:31:00.127 --> 01:31:02.212
Smile, though your heart is aching...

01:31:02.379 --> 01:31:03.922
Rap, you motherfucker!

01:31:04.047 --> 01:31:05.048
Rap!

01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:24.401
Take care of yourself.

01:31:24.735 --> 01:31:25.861
You, too.

01:31:29.907 --> 01:31:31.074
Well,

01:31:32.534 --> 01:31:33.644
you got everything?

01:31:33.744 --> 01:31:36.079
Yep. Got my cell phone.

01:31:36.914 --> 01:31:38.248
Everything.

01:31:41.084 --> 01:31:42.586
That's good.

01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:44.922
Have a safe flight.

01:31:45.589 --> 01:31:46.757
Thanks.

01:31:48.258 --> 01:31:50.928
Listen, I'm going to be in L.A.
in October.

01:31:51.220 --> 01:31:54.389
This gallery wants to
showcase my photos.

01:31:54.848 --> 01:31:56.183
Send you an invite.

01:31:57.768 --> 01:31:59.436
You can bring your wife.

01:32:00.437 --> 01:32:02.272
You know I can't go, right?

01:32:05.609 --> 01:32:08.612
It's very nice to meet you, Andre Allen.

01:32:08.946 --> 01:32:11.782
It's great to finally meet you,

01:32:12.282 --> 01:32:13.951
Chelsea Brown.

01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.455
Fry or die.

01:32:32.135 --> 01:32:33.595
Yo, Chels!

01:32:38.976 --> 01:32:40.435
What's your top five?

01:32:49.027 --> 01:32:50.696
Salt-N-Pepa,

01:32:51.655 --> 01:32:53.323
Tribe Called Quest,

01:32:53.824 --> 01:32:55.158
The Roots,

01:32:55.993 --> 01:32:57.661
Public Enemy,

01:32:59.329 --> 01:33:00.664
Kanye.

01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:06.670
And I get six, man.
Slick Rick the Ruler!

01:33:07.671 --> 01:33:09.006
Slick Rick.

01:33:12.509 --> 01:33:13.844
Take care.

01:33:14.052 --> 01:33:15.387
You, too.

01:33:46.043 --> 01:33:48.212
She's a little skinny for my taste.

01:33:48.545 --> 01:33:51.507
But if it was me,
I would be up there right now.

01:33:54.843 --> 01:33:56.453
I wouldn't worry about Erica.

01:33:56.553 --> 01:33:59.723
One way or another,
she's going to end up on top.

01:34:00.682 --> 01:34:02.684
Can't have 'em all, man.

01:34:03.227 --> 01:34:05.521
I'm not talking about having 'em all.

01:34:06.230 --> 01:34:08.190
I'm talking about having her.

01:34:13.904 --> 01:34:15.531
What you got in that gift bag, man?

01:34:16.573 --> 01:34:18.742
Let me check.

01:34:20.911 --> 01:34:23.939
Got some vodka. Okay.

01:34:24.039 --> 01:34:25.874
In my gift bag.

01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:29.086
Somebody wasn't thinking about me.

01:34:31.088 --> 01:34:32.589
I'll take that off your hands.

01:34:33.257 --> 01:34:34.383
What else you got, man?

01:34:34.591 --> 01:34:38.804
Got a jasmine-scented candle.

01:34:38.929 --> 01:34:41.457
Definitely something I would give a man.

01:34:41.557 --> 01:34:44.434
I got a Mexican chica.
She loves candles. She's a candle bitch.

01:34:44.726 --> 01:34:45.936
What else you got?

01:34:48.897 --> 01:34:50.566
Gourmet nuts.

01:34:50.774 --> 01:34:53.051
You know I love some nuts.
That's for me. Give me those.

01:34:53.151 --> 01:34:54.178
There you go.

01:34:54.278 --> 01:34:55.612
Hopefully honey-roasted.

01:34:55.821 --> 01:34:58.015
When they put the honey on the nuts?

01:34:58.115 --> 01:34:59.575
That's a whole
different world right there.

01:34:59.783 --> 01:35:01.018
And let's see.

01:35:01.118 --> 01:35:03.287
A gift certificate for...

01:35:03.787 --> 01:35:05.022
That's when they took it to a new level.

01:35:05.122 --> 01:35:06.356
You know me, I'm a snacker.

01:35:06.456 --> 01:35:09.001
Now, if they could find a way
to put the honey inside the...

01:35:09.626 --> 01:35:11.920
Some kind of cloning shit, I don't know.
Is that cloning?

01:35:23.974 --> 01:35:25.475
Yo, Silk.

01:36:04.848 --> 01:36:06.975
- You want the top five?
- Yes!

01:36:07.226 --> 01:36:08.227
Yes.

01:36:08.352 --> 01:36:09.686
Here it is.

01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:11.522
Sugarhill Gang,

01:36:11.855 --> 01:36:13.190
- Eminem...
- Right.

01:36:13.524 --> 01:36:14.858
Wale,

01:36:15.192 --> 01:36:16.860
Ice Cube...

01:36:17.194 --> 01:36:18.695
...and Sir Mix-A-Lot!

01:36:19.196 --> 01:36:20.531
Yes!

01:36:21.198 --> 01:36:23.200
"Put 'em on the glass"!
