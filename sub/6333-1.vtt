WEBVTT

02:19.723 --> 02:22.058
-Amsterdam, motherfucker.
-Okay.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.976
Come on, let's go.
Where are we going?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.145
Red-light district. Time for sneepur.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.940
Let's go to the coffee shop first,
then get some sneepur.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.359
Hey, I think the Anne Frank
house is around here.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.322
Did we come to Europe
just to smoke pot?

02:36.490 --> 02:37.990
I came all the way from Iceland.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.785
-Yeah, what if we did?
-We did that every day in college.

02:40.953 --> 02:43.120
Why not, like, you know,
check out a museum?

02:43.288 --> 02:45.248
No, you're right.
We should go to a museum.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.666
How about the hemp museum?

02:51.129 --> 02:52.839
Oli proudly presents. . .

02:54.842 --> 02:56.509
. . . Isabella.

02:57.678 --> 02:58.970
She's cute.

02:59.137 --> 03:02.515
But we can't rail a girl
who's in a coma.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.934
I think that's illegal
even in Amsterdam.

03:05.102 --> 03:08.020
-Hey, I'm just warming up, man.
-Fucking Oli.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.314
The Icelandic--
Oh, God, how are you?

03:10.482 --> 03:14.277
You want to get stoned?

03:14.820 --> 03:17.321
-This will wake you up.
-What the fuck?

03:19.908 --> 03:24.036
This is good Amsterdam shit.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.625
That's the shit right there, dude.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.502
Trust me.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.592
Yeah.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.719
-It's all good, bro.
-Yeah, dude, smoke it!

03:41.889 --> 03:44.307
-Dude, what happened?
-Any Dutch people in Amsterdam?

04:00.532 --> 04:02.116
All right, this is my friend, Josh.

04:02.284 --> 04:04.577
-Well, hello.
-Hi.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.582
-Do you guys want another round?
-Yes, okay.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.250
Yeah?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.339
We will be right back.

04:20.302 --> 04:21.928
-What are you doing?
-What?

04:22.095 --> 04:26.223
Do you see a single other person
in here with a fucking fanny pack?

04:26.391 --> 04:27.433
Wait. There's a guy.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.936
Why don't you go have
fanny-pack sex with him. . .

04:30.103 --> 04:32.688
. . .and jizz all over each other's
storage compartments?

04:32.856 --> 04:35.858
I can't put my passport in my pocket.
It chafes my thighs, bitch.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.777
-All right?
-Yeah.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.111
Where's Oli?

04:43.867 --> 04:45.201
He's fucking genius.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.791
Sneepur alert, 3 o'clock.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.210
-She smokes.
-Dude, it's Europe!

04:54.378 --> 04:57.755
Every fucking chick smokes.
Stop being a pussy.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.883
You are so easy sometimes.

05:01.259 --> 05:05.471
The power of the pack is yours.
I'm out of here.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.522
I'm sorry.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.941
Yeah, I--
No, I don't even speak Dutch.

05:17.109 --> 05:19.193
No, I'm sorry, I--

05:19.361 --> 05:22.113
Get off me, you fucking
faggot-ass elf. Fuck off.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.864
-Hey, what the fuck?
-Hey. Hey.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.825
Come on, faggot.

05:28.704 --> 05:31.831
-Fucker!
-Get your fucking hands off me.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.500
-I'm an American, I got rights.
-Get the fuck out.

05:34.668 --> 05:38.004
-Your fucking club sucks ass, bro.
-Kiss my American ass, fucker.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.006
-Fuck you.
-Let's get out of here, bro.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.133
Hey, I don't know why
you guys are waiting.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.469
It's a fucking fag fest in there.
Wall-to-wall fucking cock.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.014
You need one of these
to get in, bro. Sorry.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.682
That shit was classic, dude.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.852
He was gonna throw down
with a 400-pound Dutchman.

05:53.020 --> 05:55.396
I'm fucking awesome!

05:56.189 --> 05:57.398
I don't fucking know what--

05:57.566 --> 06:00.401
I thought you were a Jew, man.
This guy's a fucking Israeli !

06:00.569 --> 06:02.153
You are fucking Israeli.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.032
Oh, God, I hope bestiality
is legal in Amsterdam. . .

06:06.199 --> 06:09.243
. . . because that girl's a fucking hog.
Look at that, man.

06:09.661 --> 06:11.746
Hey, guys,
I think she likes me, man.

06:11.913 --> 06:15.207
Oh, look at that.
Josh, my gift to you, man.

06:15.375 --> 06:19.211
Thanks, but paying to do whatever
you want to someone isn't a turn-on.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.715
How are you gonna get over your chick
if you don't bang some new pussy?

06:22.883 --> 06:25.176
You can't go home
without getting some hot chick.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.386
I agree, but I shouldn't
have to pay for it.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.597
Hey, come on, I'm paying, man.

06:55.457 --> 06:57.041
Hey.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.502
Are you okay?

07:00.712 --> 07:03.464
Hello? Hello?

07:08.595 --> 07:11.639
Hey, close the door.
You watch, you pay.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.516
Sorry. Jesus.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.851
You're up, slugger.

07:16.645 --> 07:20.314
Man, I'm fucking-- I'm tired, man.
I can, like, barely stand up.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.483
Josh, you want
to be a fucking writer?

07:22.651 --> 07:25.444
How about some life experience,
right there in that room.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.574
-What do we have in here?
-Hey, you watch, you pay.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.160
I pay. I pay, man. Come on.

07:41.711 --> 07:42.795
Hey.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.090
Come, sit.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.304
Your friends are so funny.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.849
Yeah.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.395
You can wash over here, by sink.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.870
It was fine.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.290
What do you mean? That bitch had
the best fucking tits in Amsterdam.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.667
It was fine. It was whatever.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.132
What was that?

08:28.300 --> 08:31.260
-It's fucking after curfew, man.
-Curfew? What are we, 1 3?

08:31.428 --> 08:35.014
Let us the fuck in,
we're freezing our balls off.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.765
We paid to stay here.
They can't just, like, lock us out.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.184
This is bullshit.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.602
Hello?

08:40.770 --> 08:42.354
Open the fucking door.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.362
-What did you tell him?
-He just told them to let us in.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.326
-Shut up!
-Jesus.

08:55.493 --> 08:58.245
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking Americans.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.247
Hey, I know what to do.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.836
Shut up.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.715
Hey, hey, guys. Up here.
Climb quickly.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.009
Come on.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.344
Go. Go, go, go.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.519
Oh, don't mind them.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.565
They are so fucked up they don't
know what planet they are on.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.403
-Thanks, bro.
-It's no problem.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.573
Not everyone
want to kill Americans.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.201
Paxton.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.581
Alexei. But call me Alex.

09:42.749 --> 09:47.336
What's up, Alex.
This is Josh and Oli.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.546
Guys, this is fucking awesome, man.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.258
I'm the first in line for sneepur.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.345
Oh, that's Icelandic for "clit."

09:57.764 --> 10:00.641
Clitoris or clitoris,
however you wanna say that.

10:00.809 --> 10:01.892
Women have it.

10:02.060 --> 10:06.105
It's, like, right near the labia.
Like, it hangs.

10:06.273 --> 10:09.441
Oh, yeah.
Very good sneepur in Iceland.

10:09.609 --> 10:12.027
-Yeah.
-Come on, guys, have a seat.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.287
Where you travel to?

10:21.454 --> 10:24.623
We started in Paris,
which is where we met this drifter.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.417
Anyway, we went all over France. . .

10:26.584 --> 10:29.503
. . .and then Switzerland, Belgium,
and now we're in Amsterdam.

10:29.671 --> 10:32.172
Yeah, kind of over Amsterdam.
Way too many Americans.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.384
Yeah, but Oli's got a friend
with a flat in Barcelona. . .

10:35.552 --> 10:38.762
. . .and he's supposed to hook us up
with some hot-ass seÃ±oritas.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.889
Looking for girls?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.226
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.813
So talk to Alex.

10:48.315 --> 10:51.900
He open up the pussy
all over the Europe.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.235
I can help you.

10:53.778 --> 10:57.156
Oh, shit.
Alex is a pimp, apparently.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.451
Thanks, bro,
but I think we'll be okay.

11:00.618 --> 11:02.077
-Yeah.
-Good.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.835
You looking for girls like this?

11:19.137 --> 11:22.097
These are fucking magnificent.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.143
-Who the hell are these girls?
-You have to go east, my friend.

11:26.311 --> 11:28.354
This is where the best girls are.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.855
The best.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.857
How far east?

11:32.025 --> 11:34.985
You can go as far as Ukraine,
around Odessa.

11:35.987 --> 11:39.114
These girls I met
at this one hostel in Slovakia. . .

11:39.282 --> 11:40.866
. . .just outside Bratislava.

11:41.451 --> 11:44.495
The girls there are so hot
you cannot believe it.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.290
And they love anyone foreign,
especially American.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.043
They hear your accent,
they fuck you.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.380
So wait, this place
is near Bratislava?

11:54.547 --> 11:55.672
Josh.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.634
You won't find this hostel
in any guidebook.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.971
Barcelona, so many Americans.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.265
But Slovakia? No one there.

12:05.433 --> 12:09.353
There is so much pussy, and because
of the war, there are no guys.

12:09.771 --> 12:12.815
You go to this hostel,
you will have any girl you want.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.567
They go crazy for any foreigner.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.528
You just. . .

12:18.905 --> 12:20.656
. . .take them.

12:48.643 --> 12:50.436
Fuck, man.

12:53.273 --> 12:56.483
Can't you keep your Viking ass
in your pants for, like, two seconds?

12:56.651 --> 12:58.444
Hey, man, I shaved my ass
just for you.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.696
-Okay, all right.
-My Viking balls too.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.281
Okay, stop.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.794
I'm sorry.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.463
My daughter.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.631
She miss her daddy,
and Daddy miss her.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.425
Yeah, no problem, dude, it's cool.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.306
-Saskia.
-Cute.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.435
-She's adorable.
-She's a little cutie, yeah.

13:33.188 --> 13:35.647
This is Sunneva, my daughter.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.399
-Very pretty.
-She's 6.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.610
She's starting school this year.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.196
Wait, you have a daughter?

13:42.363 --> 13:45.199
Yeah, of course, my horse.
I was married for eight years.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.994
Okay. All right.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.914
-You are on vacation?
-Yeah, we're backpacking.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.540
Our next stop is Bratislava.

13:56.294 --> 13:59.171
-What?
-Slovakia.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.008
You will like it.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.594
Casino, girls.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.807
You can pay to do anything.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.726
Anything.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.772
-How are the girls?
-Very beautiful.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.275
They will love you.
Handsome American like you.

14:22.445 --> 14:25.948
Handsome devil. He is handsome.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.993
That's-- That's awkward.
That's awkward.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.546
That's awkward too.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.384
-You need a fork there, chief?
-No, no, no.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.053
I prefer to use my hands.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.639
I believe. . .

14:50.932 --> 14:54.768
. . . people have
lost their relationship with food.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.521
They do not think:

14:57.689 --> 15:01.358
"This is something who gave its life
so I would not go hungry."

15:02.068 --> 15:05.404
I like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.989
I appreciate it more.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.616
Well, I'm vegetarian.

15:09.784 --> 15:12.244
And I am a meat-eater.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.371
It's human nature.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.499
Well, I'm human,
and it's not in my nature.

15:18.459 --> 15:21.211
Tell me, what is your nature?

15:22.046 --> 15:24.464
Don't touch !
Don't fucking touch me!

15:24.924 --> 15:26.550
I'm sorry.

15:27.969 --> 15:29.428
Excuse me.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.472
Fucking freak.

15:34.309 --> 15:35.392
Jesus.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.024
Edward Saladhands
just groped Josh.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.944
Dude, you finally hooked up.
That's awesome.

15:46.237 --> 15:48.530
Yeah, that's fucking hilarious.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.389
Or we could visit some factories.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.183
Should be cool.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.185
In this area. . .

17:00.353 --> 17:04.897
. . .we make plastic for Slovakia.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.193
Is that so?

17:30.633 --> 17:32.384
Look at this.

18:16.053 --> 18:19.347
-Nice, eh?
-This is a fucking hostel?

18:20.475 --> 18:22.768
Holy shit.

18:28.858 --> 18:31.777
You can have that, man.
I'm too scared.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.783
Hey, hey. The party has arrived.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.703
-You are saved from boredom.
-Let me guess.

18:41.871 --> 18:45.290
You must be
the King of the Swing.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.709
You made a reservation under
"King of the Swing?"

18:47.877 --> 18:49.628
-Yeah, of course, my horse.
-I'm sorry.

18:49.796 --> 18:53.673
-He doesn't get out of his cage much.
-I can see that.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.136
Here are your keys.

18:58.429 --> 19:01.264
You leave your passports
at the desk.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.188
That was taken when I was like 1 3.
I was kind of husky.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.731
Not anymore, though, you know?

19:09.899 --> 19:12.859
Do you have any private rooms?
We're probably gonna need them.

19:13.027 --> 19:17.197
The rooms are semiprivate,
so you will have roommates.

19:17.365 --> 19:20.283
Roommates, huh? That's gay.

19:28.251 --> 19:29.668
Sorry.

19:30.127 --> 19:33.255
-Oh, my God.
-It's okay.

19:33.422 --> 19:36.341
The room is yours.
We are going to the spa.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.679
You should come.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.309
Spa.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.076
Jugs.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.124
-Hey.
-Hello.

20:09.292 --> 20:11.293
Oh, Jesus.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.380
-Hi. Hey.
-Hi.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.385
How you doing?

20:23.431 --> 20:26.224
I'm so happy I shaved my balls.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.521
What? I have the smoothest balls
in Iceland.

20:31.689 --> 20:34.733
-You wanna see?
-No, no, no, you're not-- I'm good.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.193
Put your anteater away,
it's totally creepy.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.573
-You're not from Iceland, no?
-No. Fuck, no. American.

20:41.741 --> 20:44.451
Yeah, unlike him,
I had my foreskin removed at birth.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.245
Hygiene and-- Am I talking?

20:47.663 --> 20:50.206
-I'm Josh.
-Natalya.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.626
-And this is Svetlana.
-Hi.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.961
Hi, I'm Paxton.

20:55.463 --> 20:58.131
-And this is Oli.
-The King of the Swing.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.926
Hello.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.429
Face on the ass. Never gets old.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.056
Jesus.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.141
So where are you girls from?

21:08.309 --> 21:10.602
I'm from Italy,
but my parents are Russian.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.812
Prague.

21:13.773 --> 21:16.775
Prague's cool. Kafka.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.445
So, Natalya. . . .

21:20.613 --> 21:23.239
-Yeah?
-You're Russian, eh?

21:44.762 --> 21:48.431
Oh, my God.
Look, there are too many girls.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.437
-This is awesome.
-Yes.

22:35.646 --> 22:38.106
I mean, I was a senior,
you know, she was a junior. . .

22:38.274 --> 22:40.692
. . .and then I graduated,
and it was weird, you know.

22:40.860 --> 22:45.196
I mean, I'm totally over it.
It's-- You know, it's cool.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.823
It's okay.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.533
Look, Vala is here.

22:48.701 --> 22:52.203
-Who?
-Vala, from front desk. Vala.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.249
-All right, Oli.
-Hey, I told you, man.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.543
I'm the King of the Swing.

22:59.045 --> 23:02.047
Come, let's dance.

23:09.930 --> 23:12.766
-Does the cigarette bother you?
-No, it's--

23:12.933 --> 23:14.726
I put away.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.145
It's fine, I. . . .

23:17.313 --> 23:20.231
I'm gonna go get some fresh air.

23:20.483 --> 23:23.401
But I'll be back, okay?

23:45.674 --> 23:49.469
Cigarette.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.221
Aren't you a little young?

23:51.388 --> 23:53.181
-Dollar.
-What?

23:53.808 --> 23:55.100
Dollar.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.690
-Dollar.
-Here you go.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.450
Here, children commit
the most crime.

24:12.868 --> 24:15.995
They don't care.
They will attack anyone.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.207
-You're okay?
-Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

24:21.627 --> 24:23.670
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.380
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.925
Hey, Josh.

24:29.093 --> 24:30.552
Faggot.

24:30.886 --> 24:33.346
Go with your friends. It's okay.

24:33.514 --> 24:35.348
I wanted to say sorry about earlier.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.559
About the way I reacted.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.727
We cool?

24:44.525 --> 24:47.777
I would have done
the same thing at your age.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.031
It's not easy. . .

24:52.658 --> 24:54.868
. . . but from my experience. . .

24:55.035 --> 24:58.371
. . .choosing to have a family
was the right choice for me.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.083
Now I have my little girl. . .

25:02.251 --> 25:06.004
. . .who means more to me
than anything in the world.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.841
But you should do. . .

25:10.009 --> 25:12.385
. . .whatever's right for you.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.640
Excuse me, it's my turn now.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.200
Should we be doing this
with them there?

25:35.367 --> 25:37.202
Yeah, it's okay.

25:38.746 --> 25:42.916
-Yeah, baby. Josh, give it to me, baby.
-Okay, all right. Okay, stop!

25:43.083 --> 25:45.543
-All right.
-Come on, big boy.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.129
-We go to spa.
-Spa.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.965
Spa, spa, spa.
Being dirty while getting clean.

25:51.133 --> 25:52.717
Bye.

27:18.429 --> 27:20.179
Mission accomplished.

27:23.434 --> 27:27.312
You know that Amsterdam kid
with the thing on his lip?

27:27.479 --> 27:30.189
I'm gonna send him
a really nice thank-you note.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.483
Be quiet.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.614
They're showering together.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.870
Shit, man. We're never leaving here.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.665
I guess Oli's not back yet.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.585
No, dude, he probably
took that desk girl home.

27:50.753 --> 27:52.295
We'll see him at breakfast.

28:06.101 --> 28:10.313
-What's the name?
-Oli ErÃ­ksson, 237.

28:13.233 --> 28:15.860
How are we supposed to
understand this without subtitles?

28:16.028 --> 28:17.153
Fucking gay.

28:17.321 --> 28:19.364
Yeah, he checked out this morning.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.908
You mean he took his
passport to go out?

28:22.076 --> 28:24.452
No, it say he checked out
this morning.

28:25.371 --> 28:27.622
-When this morning?
-I don't know exact time.

28:27.790 --> 28:29.957
I could find out tomorrow.

28:36.256 --> 28:39.175
Hey, Oli, it's Pax.
Are you still with that chick?

28:39.343 --> 28:41.260
Can I leave a note
in case he comes back?

28:41.428 --> 28:43.471
Okay, cool. Yeah.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.267
All right.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.817
He's probably still with Vala.
When she call me, I call you, okay?

28:55.984 --> 28:57.777
Okay.

28:57.945 --> 28:59.529
-We see you later, right?
-Yeah.

29:00.197 --> 29:01.781
Okay.

29:02.866 --> 29:04.075
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

29:04.243 --> 29:08.913
Oli, hey, it's me again.
We're gonna go into town, so call us.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.748
You're gay.
Damn voice mail again.

29:10.916 --> 29:14.127
-Hi ! Hi ! Hi !
-Hi.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.003
Your friend.

29:17.256 --> 29:20.341
-What the hell?
-Your friend, my friend.

29:20.509 --> 29:22.385
What does that say?

29:23.429 --> 29:25.096
Sayonara. Your friend.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.889
What, they left? Like, together?

29:27.057 --> 29:29.934
That doesn't make any sense.
Oli doesn't even like Asian girls.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.727
I mean, no offence, but--

29:31.895 --> 29:33.438
When did she send this to you?

29:33.605 --> 29:35.731
This picture. Today?

29:36.275 --> 29:39.193
Could you do me a favour
and send this picture to my phone?

29:39.361 --> 29:40.403
This picture.

29:42.739 --> 29:44.115
That water looks fucking cold.

29:44.283 --> 29:46.784
You know, if you fell in,
you'd die in 90 seconds.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.412
Dude, did I tell you I saw
a girl drown when I was 8?

29:50.080 --> 29:52.373
-Where?
-Lake Michigan.

29:52.541 --> 29:57.462
It was fucked up, man.
This little girl, probably 4 or 5.

29:57.838 --> 30:01.299
We made eye contact,
which was a weird thing, you know. . .

30:01.467 --> 30:04.093
. . .and she was yelling for me
to help her.

30:04.261 --> 30:05.636
Yeah? What did you do?

30:05.804 --> 30:09.640
I ran to the lifeguard, who was busy
talking to her boyfriend at the time. . .

30:09.808 --> 30:12.351
. . .and I yelled, you know,
"There's this girl drowning."

30:12.519 --> 30:15.396
And she couldn't see her.
Probably thought I was making it up.

30:15.564 --> 30:19.609
And then a second later all you could
hear was this horrible screaming.

30:20.068 --> 30:22.361
It was that little girl's mother, dude.

30:23.071 --> 30:24.489
Her kid was dead.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.700
-Jesus.
-I had nightmares for years after that.

30:27.868 --> 30:31.621
I mean, I'd wake up every fucking
night hearing that mother scream.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.372
I just. . . .

30:33.540 --> 30:35.333
I just felt like I could have
done more.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.127
You did the right thing.
Could've been a double drowning.

30:38.295 --> 30:40.505
Yeah, well, I didn't see it
that way at the time.

30:40.672 --> 30:44.342
All I knew was this little girl was dead
and her mother's life was ruined.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.677
What makes you think of this now?

30:50.849 --> 30:51.891
Bubble gum.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.853
-Sorry, kid.
-No, no. Give him some.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.359
What are you doing?

31:02.444 --> 31:05.029
These fucking kids are dangerous.

31:05.781 --> 31:07.240
Hey, Oli.

31:07.407 --> 31:09.617
-Hey, Oli.
-Hey.

31:12.246 --> 31:14.163
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:14.331 --> 31:17.625
-Hey, Oli. Hey!
-Oli !

31:22.631 --> 31:24.423
It's your lucky day, Josh.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.217
A museum.

32:12.014 --> 32:13.347
How's it hanging?

32:15.475 --> 32:18.269
-What the fuck?
-Holy shit.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.396
-He got you.
-Yeah, that's hilarious.

32:20.564 --> 32:21.772
Okay.

32:22.482 --> 32:27.445
Hey, Oli.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.946
Hey, hey.

32:30.824 --> 32:32.116
Excuse me?

32:32.951 --> 32:36.078
I'm sorry, I thought you
were someone else.

32:36.246 --> 32:38.873
Well, I'm not.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.625
Where did you get that jacket?

32:43.045 --> 32:46.589
-Hey, I'm talking to you, man.
-Get your fucking hands off me.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.885
This is my jacket.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.653
It's from Oli.

33:10.072 --> 33:11.113
"I go home"?

34:09.840 --> 34:12.425
I don't know,
maybe his battery died.

34:13.635 --> 34:16.053
Hey, Kana, when are you leaving?

34:17.389 --> 34:20.683
I'm sorry. When are you going away?

34:21.268 --> 34:23.393
Tomorrow, I go.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.937
Okay, because we may go too.

34:25.105 --> 34:28.899
Do you wanna go to the train with us?
To the train station?

34:30.652 --> 34:32.610
Tomorrow, train?

34:32.779 --> 34:34.447
Yeah, yeah.

34:37.199 --> 34:39.076
-Hello, Josh.
-Hey.

34:39.244 --> 34:41.203
-Hey.
-Come, we go for disco?

34:41.371 --> 34:45.081
Actually, I just wanna find my friend
and get the fuck out of here.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.212
Okay, we'll see you.

34:55.969 --> 34:59.680
Hey, guys, hold up a sec.
We'll be right out.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.474
Okay.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.437
-Josh, come here, dude.
-Yeah, what?

35:06.938 --> 35:10.191
It's not their fault Oli disappeared,
so stop acting like it is.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.485
-I'm annoyed he'd ditch us.
-I'm pissed too.

35:12.652 --> 35:14.153
But we're not in America.

35:14.321 --> 35:17.281
I mean, people meet each other
and split without saying shit.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.366
It's just how they do it over here.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.453
As well as we may think we know Oli,
we don't really know him.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.497
He could've gone
somewhere with that girl.

35:24.664 --> 35:27.708
Fuck, maybe he's in Iceland.
The guy's got a daughter.

35:27.876 --> 35:29.210
So let's look at our options.

35:29.377 --> 35:32.630
We can A, fuck these girls one more
night and then head to Barcelona. . .

35:32.798 --> 35:36.133
. . .or B, not fuck them,
then head to Barcelona anyway.

35:36.301 --> 35:40.137
Think about it. When I'm studying for
the bar and you're writing your thesis. . .

35:40.305 --> 35:42.389
. . .this is the shit
we're gonna think about.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.643
Okay. All right, he doesn't show up,
it's his problem.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.145
-It's his problem.
-All right.

35:48.313 --> 35:50.439
All right.

35:50.607 --> 35:53.901
Hey, Kana, you wanna go
to the disco with us?

35:54.319 --> 35:55.820
You know, disco?
Dancing?

35:56.905 --> 35:58.322
No?

36:39.281 --> 36:41.365
Josh?

36:41.533 --> 36:44.326
-I'm gonna go back.
-Are you okay?

36:44.494 --> 36:45.828
I'm, like-- I'm tired.

36:45.996 --> 36:48.539
Actually, I have, like, a headache.

36:49.374 --> 36:51.500
If you want, I will go with you.

36:52.085 --> 36:56.171
No, no, no, I'll just see you
back at the room.

36:58.216 --> 37:00.342
Goodbye.

37:05.390 --> 37:06.473
Fucking pussy.

37:38.965 --> 37:40.507
-Josh.
-Vala.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.509
You don't look well.

37:42.677 --> 37:44.929
-No, I--
-Here, let me help you.

37:45.096 --> 37:48.140
I feel sick.

37:58.652 --> 38:01.528
Where is. . .?
Where is Oli?

38:01.696 --> 38:03.739
You need rest.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.435
Where's the restroom?

38:34.062 --> 38:36.480
Past the bar, in the back.

38:43.488 --> 38:44.571
You guys cool?

38:45.323 --> 38:47.658
-Vodka Red Bull.
-Vodka Red Bull, danke.

38:52.539 --> 38:53.998
Yeah.

39:34.998 --> 39:39.710
Hey!

40:02.734 --> 40:04.610
Open the door.

40:25.381 --> 40:27.257
Oh, fuck.

40:32.889 --> 40:34.389
What the f--?

40:52.575 --> 40:54.451
Oh, fuck.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.468
What. . .? Who are you?

41:11.970 --> 41:13.637
What the f--? Where the fuck am I?

41:13.805 --> 41:16.265
What the fuck is this shit?

41:17.142 --> 41:19.309
Please, please--
Fuck. Please, please, please--

41:19.477 --> 41:21.728
I didn't fucking do shit to you,
what the fuck!

41:23.815 --> 41:25.732
Please, please, what the--?

41:25.900 --> 41:29.319
Please, no, sir.
Please fucking stop. Please!

41:29.487 --> 41:30.654
What the fuck?

41:31.281 --> 41:33.490
Please, I didn't fucking do anything.

41:34.576 --> 41:36.160
What the fuck?

41:36.327 --> 41:40.372
What the fuck?
This is such fucking bullshit.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.040
What the fuck is this?

41:42.208 --> 41:44.042
What? No! No, please don't--!

41:44.210 --> 41:46.336
What the--?
No, no, fucking don't you-- No, no!

41:46.713 --> 41:49.173
Oh, my God, no, no!
Oh, my fucking God !

41:49.340 --> 41:51.341
Oh, my God ! No, no, no, no!

41:51.509 --> 41:53.760
Oh, please. What the fuck?

41:53.928 --> 41:56.346
No, no, no, no, fuck! No!

42:05.023 --> 42:08.275
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

42:40.850 --> 42:42.059
You.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.358
Why?

42:52.528 --> 42:56.406
I always wanted to be a surgeon. . .

42:56.991 --> 42:59.785
. . . but the boards wouldn't pass me.

43:00.954 --> 43:02.246
Can you guess why?

43:13.007 --> 43:14.508
You see?

43:16.135 --> 43:18.387
So I went into business. . .

43:18.554 --> 43:21.223
. . . but business is so boring.

43:21.933 --> 43:25.978
You buy things, you sell them.
You make money, you spend money.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.896
What kind of life is that?

43:28.606 --> 43:30.857
A surgeon. . .

43:31.025 --> 43:34.778
. . . he holds the very essence
of life in his hands.

43:35.113 --> 43:36.655
Your life.

43:36.823 --> 43:39.283
He touches it.

43:40.785 --> 43:43.287
He has a relationship with it.

43:43.663 --> 43:46.164
He's part of it.

43:48.793 --> 43:51.586
Please, please.
Just let me go, please.

43:51.754 --> 43:54.298
You want to go?

43:54.799 --> 43:57.301
Is that what you want?

44:16.362 --> 44:18.822
Oh, my God !

44:24.871 --> 44:27.331
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

44:38.051 --> 44:40.052
You are free to go.

45:04.827 --> 45:08.330
Oh, fuck. No!

45:08.498 --> 45:11.541
No. No, fuck. No, fuck--

45:12.585 --> 45:15.253
Please, I have money.
I'll fucking pay you.

45:15.421 --> 45:17.297
Ten times, two times,
whatever you want--

45:17.465 --> 45:18.882
-Pay me?
-Yes.

45:19.050 --> 45:20.550
No one is paying me.

45:20.718 --> 45:24.262
In fact, I am the one paying them.

45:34.857 --> 45:37.692
Relax. Relax, bro.

45:38.111 --> 45:39.569
Oh, shit.

45:55.628 --> 45:57.879
-Two thirty-seven, please.
-Two three seven.

45:58.464 --> 45:59.714
Didn't you check out?

46:01.008 --> 46:02.259
No, not yet.

46:02.677 --> 46:04.177
Not yet.

46:04.345 --> 46:08.056
-This your bag?
-Yeah.

46:08.224 --> 46:10.809
The maid brought it here.
You're checked out.

46:11.102 --> 46:12.727
-I didn't check out.
-It says.

46:12.895 --> 46:14.563
It happened this morning.

46:14.730 --> 46:16.857
This is bullshit.
Did somebody leave a note?

46:17.024 --> 46:19.109
Because I didn't
fucking check out, dude.

46:19.610 --> 46:22.821
No, man, just this bag.
If it's a mistake--

46:22.989 --> 46:25.574
Yeah, it's definitely a mistake.
We need a fucking room.

46:25.741 --> 46:29.119
Chill out, man. You're on vacation.

46:30.663 --> 46:32.289
Two three seven.

46:35.626 --> 46:39.129
Hey, was there a Japanese girl
waiting in the lobby for somebody?

46:39.297 --> 46:42.382
No, think they left this morning.

46:42.550 --> 46:44.050
Yeah.

46:46.846 --> 46:48.638
I'm sorry, dude.

46:56.355 --> 46:58.773
Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

46:59.942 --> 47:02.819
It's okay. We are going to the spa.

47:02.987 --> 47:04.988
You will join us?

47:09.827 --> 47:11.786
You should come.

47:18.419 --> 47:20.462
Hey, Josh, call me
soon as you get this, man.

47:20.630 --> 47:22.839
I got locked in that club.
It was retarded, dude.

47:23.007 --> 47:24.674
I'm at the hostel.

47:27.678 --> 47:33.016
Svetlana!

48:03.714 --> 48:04.923
Hey!

48:11.055 --> 48:12.264
You little fucker.

48:29.448 --> 48:30.824
Jesus.

48:30.992 --> 48:32.742
Wait at hostel for your friends.

48:32.910 --> 48:35.412
They will look for you there
no matter what.

48:35.580 --> 48:39.833
Yeah, I know. But, see, my friend
Josh is the kind of guy who--

48:40.001 --> 48:43.795
He just wouldn't check out without
so much as leaving a note, you know.

48:44.672 --> 48:46.590
He's the responsible one.

48:46.757 --> 48:49.759
Yeah, but maybe he worried
his belongings get stolen. . .

48:49.927 --> 48:51.928
. . .so he take them when he go out.

48:52.096 --> 48:54.639
Someone misplace if he leaves note.

48:55.266 --> 48:56.725
It is not uncommon.

48:59.520 --> 49:02.063
Yeah, well, is there
anything else that I can do?

49:03.399 --> 49:06.026
There's nothing right now.

49:06.444 --> 49:07.652
We have his picture. . .

49:07.820 --> 49:11.072
. . . if we see him, or he is picked up,
or something happen. . .

49:11.240 --> 49:13.992
. . .we contact you at hostel, yeah?

49:14.160 --> 49:15.619
Okay.

49:17.622 --> 49:19.122
Where are you from?

49:19.999 --> 49:21.291
California.

49:23.210 --> 49:25.879
You are so far from home.

50:49.380 --> 50:52.382
Paxton. Come, have a drink.

50:55.553 --> 50:58.304
Hello, Mr. American.

51:00.558 --> 51:02.934
-Did you get my messages?
-Which one?

51:03.394 --> 51:04.644
There are so many.

51:04.812 --> 51:07.522
I call you back, but child answer.

51:08.023 --> 51:09.441
Yeah, I know.

51:09.608 --> 51:11.192
Have you seen Josh?

51:16.157 --> 51:17.866
In English, please.

51:18.993 --> 51:20.744
He is with your friend. . .

51:20.911 --> 51:22.746
. . .the King of the Swing.

51:23.372 --> 51:26.374
-He's with Oli.
-Why you leave last night?

51:26.917 --> 51:30.795
Did you not listen to my messages?
I got locked in a storage room.

51:30.963 --> 51:34.299
I don't know,
I got sick and passed out.

51:37.678 --> 51:40.597
-What?
-She said you met another girl.

51:40.765 --> 51:42.640
Where are my friends?

51:48.647 --> 51:50.690
The art show.

51:51.901 --> 51:54.444
-You mean like a museum?
-No, no, no.

51:55.279 --> 52:00.950
Not museum.
They went-- How you say, for artist?

52:01.118 --> 52:04.120
-Exhibit.
-Exhibit for artist.

52:04.288 --> 52:05.789
No, that doesn't make any sense.

52:05.956 --> 52:07.624
Why? What is wrong?

52:07.792 --> 52:10.919
Well, they didn't leave a note.
They didn't call or do anything.

52:11.170 --> 52:12.545
They tell us to tell you.

52:12.713 --> 52:14.672
Yeah, but I tried calling them all day.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.967
Yes, but their phone, the battery die
and they do not have--

52:18.135 --> 52:20.136
How you say, for electricity?

52:20.304 --> 52:23.306
Converter. Okay, whatever,
where is this art show. . .

52:23.474 --> 52:25.099
. . . because I wanna go.

52:25.267 --> 52:27.101
-Have a drink.
-I don't want a drink.

52:27.269 --> 52:29.437
All right? I wanna see some art.

52:29.605 --> 52:32.273
Okay? So can we go?

52:44.995 --> 52:46.287
You're not going?

52:47.039 --> 52:49.082
I've seen this show.

52:55.506 --> 52:57.507
You want gum?

52:58.175 --> 52:59.551
No.

53:21.740 --> 53:23.324
Too bad for you.

53:29.874 --> 53:31.040
We are here.

54:29.808 --> 54:31.935
Are you coming or what?

54:34.021 --> 54:36.940
Excuse me. Excuse me.

54:37.274 --> 54:38.608
How is it in there?

54:40.027 --> 54:41.611
Be careful.

54:43.447 --> 54:44.781
Why is that?

54:45.491 --> 54:49.702
You could spend all your money. . .

54:50.120 --> 54:51.788
. . . in there.

55:27.032 --> 55:28.282
How much is it?

55:28.909 --> 55:30.535
For you, free.

55:47.845 --> 55:49.345
There.

55:51.181 --> 55:52.515
That's the show?

55:54.727 --> 55:56.310
Yes.

56:11.785 --> 56:14.412
-What?
-Nothing.

56:14.580 --> 56:19.459
You're so serious,
Mr. Serious American.

57:23.232 --> 57:25.274
You fucking whore.

57:26.777 --> 57:28.444
You fucking bitch.

57:29.113 --> 57:30.780
You fucking bitch !

57:32.116 --> 57:35.034
I get a lot of money for you. . .

57:35.202 --> 57:38.287
. . .and that make you my bitch.

57:40.958 --> 57:44.127
Fuck. Get the fuck off me!

57:45.671 --> 57:47.797
This is fucked !

57:47.965 --> 57:51.968
Get the fuck off me!

58:50.819 --> 58:52.236
Fuck.

59:21.892 --> 59:23.059
Talk.

59:26.521 --> 59:28.064
Talk. Speak.

59:29.358 --> 59:31.192
What the fuck
do you want me to say?

59:33.111 --> 59:34.820
American.

59:37.282 --> 59:38.699
No. No, wait!

59:38.867 --> 59:41.244
I'm not fucking American !

59:42.120 --> 59:45.289
I'm not fucking-- Look at me.
I'm not fucking American.

59:46.124 --> 59:47.750
American.

59:50.295 --> 59:53.256
Please, what the fuck is this?

59:58.512 --> 01:00:01.931
Let me go. Please.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:05.810
I promise I won't tell anybody.

01:00:05.978 --> 01:00:09.522
Just please let me go.

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.800
Don't. Don't.

01:00:37.968 --> 01:00:39.635
Please don't.

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:51.897
Don't, please.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.444
God.

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:30.644
Oh, please, stop!

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:33.606
Please stop it. Please stop it.

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:37.360
I know you don't wanna do this.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.028
Please don't do this.

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:57.453
Fuck.

01:12:18.001 --> 01:12:19.835
Oh, shit.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.734
What the fuck?

01:13:26.736 --> 01:13:28.153
What do you think?

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:31.615
How do I look?

01:13:31.783 --> 01:13:34.868
I feel like a butcher or a surgeon
or some shit, know what I mean?

01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:38.872
I feel fucking ridiculous in this thing,
but I guess you need it, huh?

01:13:41.501 --> 01:13:44.503
Yeah. I'll tell you something. . . .

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:48.632
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Wait a sec.

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:51.760
How was it?

01:13:56.182 --> 01:13:57.599
Good.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:01.103
Well, goddamn, motherfucker,
for this money, it better be. Shit.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.563
What did you go for, a local?

01:14:03.731 --> 01:14:04.940
What, European?

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:08.568
-American.
-An Amer--?

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:12.280
Ain't that a bitch. Big spender.
I fucking-- I love it.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:15.283
I just fucking love that shit.
You know what they got for me?

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:17.452
They told me they lined up
something special.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.746
I've been waiting almost a week
for this shit.

01:14:19.914 --> 01:14:21.665
For 50 grand,
she better be worth it.

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:24.084
But it's supposed to be
a real rush, right?

01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:28.922
It's like-- They told me
it's like a real fucking rush, right?

01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:30.632
Come here.

01:14:31.551 --> 01:14:34.427
I've been all over the world.
You know, I've been everywhere.

01:14:34.595 --> 01:14:37.430
And the bottom line is,
pussy's pussy.

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:41.685
You know, every strip club,
every whorehouse, every. . . .

01:14:41.853 --> 01:14:43.520
It's all the same shit.

01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:47.732
I just fucked a girl two days ago, I don't
even remember the colour of her tits.

01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:53.655
But this, this is something
you never forget, right?

01:14:55.366 --> 01:14:56.408
Right?

01:14:58.244 --> 01:15:00.036
-Never.
-Never, right.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.707
Let me show you something.
Pretty sweet. Check this out.

01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:06.835
What do you think of this?
Come on, let me see yours.

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:11.047
Come on, let me see yours.
We're all in the same club.

01:15:11.883 --> 01:15:13.383
I'll be out in a second, guy.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:17.762
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you mind?

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:20.348
How'd you do it?

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:23.226
Did you do it real slow. . .

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:26.479
. . .or did you just get it over with
right away?

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:28.398
That's why I asked for
the fucking gun.

01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:30.692
Because I just wanted
to fucking do it quick.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.444
I just wanted to get it over with.

01:15:32.612 --> 01:15:35.197
But now I'm thinking maybe
I wanna feel it, you know?

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.032
I wanna fucking feel that shit.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.535
So I don't know what to-- I'm thinking--
What do you think I should do?

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:45.665
-Make it quick.
-Make it quick.

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:47.792
Yes.

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:50.378
Yeah, that's-- No, fuck that shit.

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:53.840
Fuck this, too fucking American, dude.
I'm going fucking old school.

01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:55.717
Who wants this, motherfucker?

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:58.553
Who wants this shit?
Come on, motherfucker.

01:15:58.721 --> 01:16:00.430
Bring it.

01:17:28.686 --> 01:17:30.061
Hey, buddy.

01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:32.939
Get your own fucking room.
I paid for this.

01:17:35.818 --> 01:17:37.152
What are you, fucking deaf?

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:47.329
Kana.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:58.006
-Oh, my God.
-What do you want me to do, Kana?

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:05.180
What? I don't understand
what you're saying. What?

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:17.567
Fuck. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Hold still. Hold still.

01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:22.030
-Fuck. Oh, God. God.
-No. No!

01:18:22.281 --> 01:18:24.199
-Shit.
-No!

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:27.744
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:53.603
Fuck!

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:12.265
We're gonna get the fuck
out of here, Kana.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.875
Move this fucking truck!

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:43.166
Fuck.

01:22:55.929 --> 01:22:57.430
We're almost there.

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:04.062
Oh, my God.

01:23:07.483 --> 01:23:08.733
Oh, no.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.489
Fuck.

01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:52.587
Kana.

01:25:02.181 --> 01:25:04.140
Come here.

01:25:13.233 --> 01:25:16.068
No. No, Kana. Kana.

01:25:20.407 --> 01:25:21.949
No, Kana.

01:26:17.047 --> 01:26:21.175
No, thank you.
I prefer to use my hands.

01:26:21.552 --> 01:26:25.012
I believe people have lost
their relationship with food.

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.222
They do not think:

01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:29.684
"This is something who gave its life
so I would not go hungry."

01:26:29.852 --> 01:26:34.438
I like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

01:28:19.753 --> 01:28:21.712
Oh, Jesus.

01:28:33.642 --> 01:28:34.684
Goddamn !

01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:36.811
Fucker.

01:29:07.509 --> 01:29:08.884
No, please!

01:33:03.036 --> 01:33:05.955
I get a lot of money for you. . .
