WEBVTT

00:02.236 --> 00:03.836
( all scream )

00:03.838 --> 00:06.105
<i> PREVIOUSLY</i>
<i> ON</i> PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:06.107 --> 00:08.640
CHECK IT OUT.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.709
<i> Hanna: IT'S</i>
<i> ALISON'S COLOR.</i>

00:10.711 --> 00:13.445
<i> YOU CANNOT SERIOUSLY THINK</i>
<i> THAT A BLIND GIRL BROKE</i>
<i> INTO MY HOUSE.</i>

00:13.447 --> 00:15.547
I DIDN'T SAY
THAT JENNA WAS ALONE.

00:15.549 --> 00:18.384
LET'S NOT GO TO
THE TOBY PLACE, OKAY?

00:18.386 --> 00:20.419
<i> Aria: YOU GUYS THINK</i>
<i> HER GUIDE DOG</i>

00:20.421 --> 00:22.321
<i> LEFT BEHIND</i>
<i> HIS LIPSTICK?</i>

00:22.323 --> 00:23.956
DO YOU LIKE THE COLOR?

00:23.958 --> 00:25.457
UH-HUH.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.694
SHE LIVES IN THIS TOWN.
I HAVE TO SEE HER. I HAVE...

00:28.696 --> 00:31.230
<i> Mike: DO YOU THINK THEY'RE</i>
<i> GONNA WORK THIS OUT?</i>

00:31.232 --> 00:32.564
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.366
IF YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER
ANY MORE QUESTIONS,

00:34.368 --> 00:37.336
<i> LET ME GET IN THE OFFICE</i>
<i> AND SEE WHAT I CAN FIND.</i>

00:37.338 --> 00:39.605
<i> PSYCHOTHERAPY.</i>

00:39.607 --> 00:41.907
YOU'RE HER THERAPIST!
UH!

00:41.909 --> 00:44.076
YOU AND I HAVE
VERY DIFFERENT IDEAS
OF WHAT'S FRIENDLY.

00:44.078 --> 00:46.178
THAT'S AN ANGRY SERVE.
<i> Hanna: IF YOU WANT</i>
<i> TO TAKE SOMEONE ELSE</i>

00:46.180 --> 00:48.414
<i> TO HOMECOMING,</i>
<i> SEAN, YOU SHOULD.</i>
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

00:48.416 --> 00:50.149
IT'S NOT LIKE I'D ACTUALLY
GO WITH ANYONE ELSE.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.089
<i> PRETTY. WHO MADE THAT?</i>

00:57.091 --> 00:58.557
SOMEBODY FROM SCHOOL.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.958
<i> WELL, WHOEVER MADE IT</i>
<i> MUST LIKE YOU A LOT.</i>

01:02.430 --> 01:04.830
<i> DUDE, YOU ARE</i>
<i> SO SCREWED.</i>

01:04.832 --> 01:07.666
WHEN THIS IS ALL OVER,
SHE'S GONNA GET HER DIPLOMA.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.402
YOU'RE GONNA GET A PINK SLIP
AND AN ORANGE JUMPSUIT.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.503
HOW MANY OF YOUR FRIENDS
DID YOU TELL?

01:11.505 --> 01:13.138
I DIDN'T.
'CAUSE IF "A" KNOWS,

01:13.140 --> 01:14.473
I'M THINKING "B"
AND "C" AND EVERYBODY
ELSE DOES, TOO.

01:19.847 --> 01:22.347
¶¶

01:34.695 --> 01:36.195
HEY.
MM.

01:36.197 --> 01:37.463
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:37.465 --> 01:38.664
AN INTERVENTION.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.799
WE BROUGHT TAKEOUT
AND RAG MAGS.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.668
BUT YOU CANNOT HAVE
ANY OF THOSE

01:42.670 --> 01:44.570
UNTIL YOU GET
OUT OF THESE SWEATS.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.872
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THESE?
NOTHING...

01:46.874 --> 01:48.707
EXCEPT THEY'RE STARTING
TO GRAFT TO YOUR SKIN.

01:48.709 --> 01:49.975
WELL, THEY'RE COMFY.

01:49.977 --> 01:52.711
SO ARE MOM JEANS
AND PLATFORM FLIP-FLOPS.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.380
PLUS, HOW ARE WE GONNA HELP YOU
CHOOSE A HOMECOMING DRESS

01:55.382 --> 01:57.282
IF YOU DON'T TRY
SOME ON FOR US?

01:57.284 --> 01:59.118
THAT'S EASY.
I'M NOT GOING.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.152
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE NOT GOING?

02:00.154 --> 02:01.587
YOU CAN'T
JUST NOT GO.

02:01.589 --> 02:03.155
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING INSTEAD?

02:03.157 --> 02:05.324
I DON'T KNOW. I GUESS
I'LL JUST READ THESE

02:05.326 --> 02:07.993
AND THEN INHALE A GALLON
OF CHUNKY MONKEY.

02:07.995 --> 02:11.997
HEY, LOOK, CUTTING YOURSELF OFF
FROM THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

02:11.999 --> 02:14.500
IS NOT GONNA HELP
YOUR PARENTS.

02:14.502 --> 02:16.535
AND BESIDES, THEY STILL
MIGHT WORK IT OUT.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.070
THEY'RE BARELY SPEAKING
TO EACH OTHER.

02:18.072 --> 02:19.872
PEOPLE GET ANGRY.
THEY BLOW UP.

02:19.874 --> 02:21.807
DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S OVER.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.142
EMILY, THEY
DIDN'T BLOW UP

02:23.144 --> 02:24.543
OVER HER DAD MISSING
THEIR ANNIVERSARY.

02:24.545 --> 02:27.479
HE SLEPT WITH ONE
OF HIS STUDENTS.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.114
SORRY.

02:29.116 --> 02:31.617
I'M JUST SAYING
THINGS CAN LOOK OVER ON FRIDAY,

02:31.619 --> 02:33.585
AND BY MONDAY
ALL IS FORGIVEN.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.721
SOME THINGS
JUST TAKE TIME.

02:35.723 --> 02:38.657
YEAH, MAYBE.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.059
OKAY, SO YOU'RE COMING!
COME ON!

02:41.061 --> 02:42.327
GOD...

02:42.329 --> 02:43.829
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.097
IF YOU'RE NOT COMING,

02:45.099 --> 02:47.232
CAN YOU AT LEAST CAST
AN ABSENTEE BALLOT?

02:47.234 --> 02:49.001
WHAT? I NEED
HER VOTE.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.536
HANNA, STOP ALREADY!

02:50.538 --> 02:52.471
YOU'VE GOT HOMECOMING
QUEEN LOCKED DOWN.

02:52.473 --> 02:54.439
REALLY? YOU CAN RIG
THE ELECTION?

02:54.441 --> 02:57.476
SORRY, I HAVE ENOUGH
TO DO ALREADY, THANKS.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.677
I'M HEAD
OF THE COMMITTEE,

02:58.679 --> 03:00.546
HALF OF WHICH IS OUT
SICK WITH THE FLU,

03:00.548 --> 03:04.016
SO I'LL BE RESTOCKING
THE ICE AND REFILLING
THE HUMMUS BOWL...

03:04.018 --> 03:05.450
AND TRYING TO LOOK CUTE

03:05.452 --> 03:06.952
FOR MY FIRST
OFFICIAL DATE.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.320
WITH ALEX?

03:08.322 --> 03:10.522
WAIT, YOU'RE BRINGING HIM
TO HOMECOMING?

03:10.524 --> 03:11.890
SO, THIS IS REAL!

03:13.894 --> 03:15.294
LOOK AT HER BLUSH!

03:15.296 --> 03:18.797
STOP!
DAMN! NOW I HAVE TO COME.

03:18.799 --> 03:19.932
SERIOUSLY, YOU GUYS,

03:19.934 --> 03:21.233
HE'S NOT GONNA KNOW
ANYBODY THERE,

03:21.235 --> 03:22.701
SO CAN YOU JUST
DO YOUR BEST

03:22.703 --> 03:23.936
TO MAKE HIM
FEEL INCLUDED?

03:23.938 --> 03:25.971
NO, WE WERE PLANNING
ON FREEZING HIM OUT.

03:25.973 --> 03:27.539
ALL RIGHT,
MOVING ON.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.541
EM, WHO ARE YOU
GONNA BRING?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.210
I THINK I'M GONNA GO STAG.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.245
I WILL, TOO.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.746
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
COME TOGETHER?

03:34.748 --> 03:36.481
OH, YOU'D MAKE
SUCH A CUTE COUPLE.

03:36.483 --> 03:39.451
HOW DID I JUST GO
FROM WEARING MOM JEANS

03:39.453 --> 03:41.653
TO BEING SAMANTHA RONSON?

03:41.655 --> 03:43.255
( chuckles )

03:43.257 --> 03:46.225
WHO CARES WHO ANYONE
GOES TO THIS THING WITH?

03:46.227 --> 03:47.759
I MEAN,
IT'S JUST A DANCE.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.661
YOU SHOULD BRING SOMEONE
WHO YOU HAVE FUN WITH.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.067
I MIGHT WANT TO GO
WITH SOMEONE.

03:55.069 --> 03:57.936
I JUST DON'T WANT PEOPLE
THINKING IT MEANS
MORE THAN IT DOES.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.404
ARE YOU AND BEN
BACK TOGETHER?

03:59.406 --> 04:02.107
NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.610
SO... WHO'S
THE MYSTERY DUDE?

04:04.612 --> 04:06.545
I'M STARVING.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.127
WHAT'S WRONG?
BAD FORTUNE?

04:22.129 --> 04:24.496
YEAH, CONFUCIUS SAYS
STOP BEING SUCH A DRAMA QUEEN.

04:24.498 --> 04:28.300
"LIONS AND TIGERS
AND BITCHES, OH MY!

04:28.302 --> 04:30.569
"THERE'S NO PLACE
LIKE HOMECOMING.

04:30.571 --> 04:32.604
SEE YOU THERE. 'A.'"

04:56.030 --> 04:57.296
The Pierces:
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET ¶</i>

04:57.298 --> 04:58.830
<i> ¶ CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

04:58.832 --> 05:00.899
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

05:00.901 --> 05:03.402
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

05:03.404 --> 05:06.071
<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

05:06.073 --> 05:08.140
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THEN I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

05:08.142 --> 05:11.276
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

05:11.278 --> 05:13.445
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>
<i> CAN KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

05:13.447 --> 05:15.347
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD ¶</i>

05:18.085 --> 05:20.986
SO, MY PARENTS ARE GOING
OUT OF TOWN THIS WEEKEND,

05:20.988 --> 05:23.221
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU COULD STAY THE NIGHT.

05:25.025 --> 05:28.994
I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF
THINKING, AND I'M READY...

05:28.996 --> 05:30.495
TO DO IT.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.201
SEAN, I'M NOT READY.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.837
I MADE A COMMITMENT
TO MYSELF...

05:38.839 --> 05:41.373
A COMMITMENT
I WANT TO HONOR.

05:41.375 --> 05:45.977
GOOD. NICE WORK, YOU GUYS.
SIT DOWN.

05:45.979 --> 05:49.247
MAY I HAVE
TWO OTHER VOLUNTEERS, PLEASE?

05:52.286 --> 05:53.552
HANNA.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.020
YOU WANNA GIVE IT A GO?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.555
NO.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.724
SEE? I CAN SAY NO.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.592
SO CAN I. GET UP.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.693
YOU CAN BE
THE INSTIGATOR.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.365
LUCAS!

06:08.168 --> 06:11.403
UH, NO, I'M REALLY
MORE COMFORTABLE

06:11.405 --> 06:14.539
IN AN OBSERVATIONAL ROLE
DURING SEXERCISE.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.608
COME ON, YOU TWO.
LET'S GO.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.684
( sighs ) SO, YOU WANT
TO COME UP TO MY ROOM?

06:28.822 --> 06:30.822
I CAN'T DO THIS.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.824
BUT YOU MAKE ME SO HOT.

06:32.826 --> 06:37.396
NO, I MEAN, I CAN'T
DO THIS WITH YOU.

06:37.398 --> 06:40.098
GIRLS LIKE HER DON'T
APPROACH GUYS LIKE ME

06:40.100 --> 06:41.366
UNLESS THEY HAVE

06:41.368 --> 06:42.634
DEEP-SEATED
SELF-ESTEEM ISSUES

06:42.636 --> 06:44.603
AND A SERIOUS
DRINKING PROBLEM.

06:44.605 --> 06:46.138
JUST PLAY ALONG, LUCAS.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.677
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.
WHY?

06:52.679 --> 06:55.380
BECAUSE I DON'T NEED TO KNOW
HOW TO REBUFF THE ADVANCES

06:55.382 --> 06:58.950
OF A GENETIC SPLICE BETWEEN
BARBIE AND SHAKIRA.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.685
IT'S JUST NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.487
THE POINT OF THIS
IS TO BE PREPARED

07:02.489 --> 07:04.322
FOR THE SITUATION
WHEN IT DOES ARISE--

07:04.324 --> 07:06.224
MR. MAZARRA, LET'S
LOOK AT THE FACTS.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.593
I HAVE THE UPPER-BODY
STRENGTH OF SCREECH,

07:08.595 --> 07:12.431
AND I SPEND MY WEEKENDS
PLAYING Wii... ALONE.

07:12.433 --> 07:13.732
I THINK
MY VIRGINITY

07:13.734 --> 07:14.966
IS PRETTY WELL
SAFEGUARDED.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.502
BOTH OF YOU,
START AGAIN.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.908
SO, YOU WANNA COME UP
TO MY ROOM?

07:22.910 --> 07:24.109
YES.

07:25.379 --> 07:26.578
( chuckles )

07:26.580 --> 07:28.914
( period bell rings )

07:30.918 --> 07:33.552
HEY. CAN I TALK
TO YOU?

07:33.554 --> 07:35.554
NO, I CAN'T.
I HAVE A STAFF MEETING.

07:35.556 --> 07:36.888
NO, I JUST NEED--
I'M LATE.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.438
HEY.

07:53.440 --> 07:55.307
HEY.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.042
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
IN A WHILE.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.945
YEAH. THINGS HAVE
BEEN KIND OF BUSY.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.680
ME AND THE GIRLS
HAVE BEEN WORKING

08:01.682 --> 08:03.482
ON THE MEMORIAL
FOR ALISON.

08:03.484 --> 08:04.950
OH, RIGHT.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.991
YOU GOING TO HOMECOMING?

08:12.993 --> 08:16.761
UM... I DON'T THINK SO.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.631
DANCE MUSIC
ISN'T MY THING.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.867
I'M NOT REALLY GAGA
FOR GAGA.

08:27.140 --> 08:31.643
SO... MAYBE WE SHOULD...

08:31.645 --> 08:33.712
TRY TO CATCH UP SOMETIME?

08:33.714 --> 08:35.881
YEAH. WE SHOULD.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.219
I HAVE TO GO TO CLASS.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.964
WAY TO SNEAK UP
ON PEOPLE.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.833
SORRY. LOOK, CAN YOU
GET IT TODAY?

08:54.835 --> 08:56.501
GET WHAT?
JENNA'S FILE.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.670
NO. THEY CANCELED
MY SHIFT AT WORK.

08:58.672 --> 08:59.938
WELL, GO IN ANYWAY.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.273
IT'S A THERAPIST'S OFFICE.

09:01.275 --> 09:02.574
PRETEND YOU'RE HAVING
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

09:02.576 --> 09:04.509
WELL, IF I LOSE THE CROWN
TO HEATHER PEREZ,

09:04.511 --> 09:05.744
I WON'T HAVE TO PRETEND.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.112
HANNA, I'M SERIOUS.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.780
THAT FILE MIGHT BE
OUR ONLY CHANCE

09:08.782 --> 09:10.949
TO FIND OUT WHAT JENNA
KNOWS ABOUT THAT NIGHT,

09:10.951 --> 09:13.118
AND IF SHE
AND HER CREEPY STEPBROTHER
ARE PLANNING REVENGE--

09:13.120 --> 09:15.120
SPENCE, I'LL GET IT.
WHY THE PANIC ATTACK?

09:15.122 --> 09:16.621
IS IT BECAUSE
OF THE FORTUNE COOKIE?

09:16.623 --> 09:18.356
IT'S BECAUSE TOBY CAVANAUGH,

09:18.358 --> 09:20.325
WHO'S NEVER HAD
A DATE IN HIS LIFE,

09:20.327 --> 09:21.693
JUST BOUGHT TWO TICKETS
TO HOMECOMING.

09:23.297 --> 09:25.063
SO, JENNA'S COMING, TOO.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.899
WELL, THEY DID PROMISE
TO SEE US THERE, RIGHT?

09:27.901 --> 09:31.369
HEY, HANNA. SPENCER.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.405
SO, IS IT TRUE
YOU'RE TAKING

09:33.407 --> 09:36.207
THE COUNTRY CLUB'S TOWEL BOY
TO HOMECOMING?

09:36.209 --> 09:38.543
HIS NAME IS ALEX,
AND YES, I AM.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.045
KNOCK IT OFF, MONA.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.279
WHAT?

09:41.281 --> 09:43.315
I THINK IT'S CUTE
SHE'S TAKING

09:43.317 --> 09:45.517
HER CINDERFELLA
TO THE BALL.

09:45.519 --> 09:47.619
CAN YOU GO GET ME
A FRO-YO WITH SPRINKLES?

09:52.826 --> 09:57.195
WOW, THAT WAS EXACTLY
THE REACTION I WANT TO AVOID.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.763
DON'T PAY
ANY ATTENTION TO HER.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.265
SHE'S JUST INSECURE.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.733
YEAH, LIKE A PIT BULL.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.234
WHY ARE YOU FRIENDS WITH HER?

10:03.236 --> 10:05.904
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HER,
SHE'S REALLY FUNNY...

10:05.906 --> 10:08.039
AND SHE'S ALWAYS
THERE FOR ME,

10:08.041 --> 10:10.575
EVEN IF IT'S JUST TO
WATCH ME TRY ON SHOES.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.876
LOOK, SHE'S
A GOOD PERSON.

10:11.878 --> 10:13.845
SHE JUST TALKS TOUGH
SO PEOPLE WILL FORGET

10:13.847 --> 10:15.914
WHAT A GEEK
SHE USED TO BE.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.817
OW! OKAY,
YOU NEED TO CHILLAX,

10:18.819 --> 10:21.353
OR I NEED TO START
CARRYING A TRANQ GUN.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.121
SHH.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.823
WHAT IS THAT?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.302
HI.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.536
HEY.

10:38.538 --> 10:40.639
I WAS ABOUT TO LOOK FOR YOU.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.974
YOU WERE? HOW COME?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.843
WELL, I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.847
UM...

10:50.150 --> 10:51.983
DO YOU WANT
TO HANG OUT TOMORROW?

10:51.985 --> 10:55.520
UM, I WOULD,
BUT I CAN'T.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.889
I'M GOING WITH MY FRIENDS
TO HOMECOMING.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.891
THAT'S TOO BAD. I...

11:01.962 --> 11:03.928
I WAS HOPING MAYBE
YOU'D GO WITH ME.

11:03.930 --> 11:06.164
TO HOMECOMING? UH...

11:06.166 --> 11:09.467
I DIDN'T THINK
THAT WAS YOUR SCENE.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.503
I HAVE A SCENE?

11:11.505 --> 11:13.471
I DIDN'T THINK LISTENING
TO THE SMITHS

11:13.473 --> 11:15.473
ALONE IN MY ROOM
WAS A SCENE.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.078
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.016
I THINK WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO WITH ME.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.352
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

11:27.354 --> 11:29.154
IT'S JUST...

11:29.156 --> 11:31.856
I WOULD'VE THOUGHT YOU THINK
HOMECOMING IS LAME.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.259
IT IS PRETTY LAME, BUT...

11:36.129 --> 11:37.362
YOU'RE NOT.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.202
OKAY.

11:44.204 --> 11:47.505
SO... I'LL PICK YOU UP
AT 9:00.

11:47.507 --> 11:51.710
SURE... BUT IT
STARTS AT 8:00.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.378
LAME.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.518
¶ WHAT YOU GONNA DO
WHEN YOUR MOM SAYS NO ¶

12:00.520 --> 12:02.754
¶ BUT YOU GOTTA SAVE PRIDE
AND YOU GOTTA GO? ¶

12:02.756 --> 12:06.391
¶ I'M GONNA HAVE TO RUN
I'M GONNA HAVE TO RUN ¶

12:06.393 --> 12:09.194
¶ WHAT, YOU THINK LIFE
CAN BE PUT ON HOLD? ¶

12:09.196 --> 12:11.529
HEY, NEED ANY HELP?

12:11.531 --> 12:13.364
YOU'RE A LITTLE EARLY.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.366
THE DANCE DOESN'T START
FOR 27 HOURS.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.335
BUT I WANTED
TO DO A DRY RUN,

12:17.337 --> 12:18.603
TEST OUT THE ROUTE,

12:18.605 --> 12:20.371
TIME MYSELF
DOOR-TO-DOOR.

12:20.373 --> 12:23.608
YOU SOUND LIKE ME.
YEAH, BUT... I WAS JOKING.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.744
OH.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.113
I'M ABOUT TO BUY A SUIT,
AND I WANTED TO KNOW

12:28.115 --> 12:30.048
WHAT COLOR YOUR DRESS IS
SO WE CAN MATCH.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.350
OH! DON'T BOTHER.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.519
LOOK, I'LL MATCH
MY OUTFIT TO YOURS.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.020
JUST WEAR WHATEVER
YOU HAVE.

12:36.022 --> 12:38.556
OKAY, WE CAN'T BOTH SHOW UP
IN JEANS AND A T-SHIRT.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.925
YOU'RE SURE
THAT YOU WANT TO?

12:40.927 --> 12:43.228
YES, I WANT TO.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.396
IT'S A GOOD EXCUSE
TO BUY A SUIT,

12:45.398 --> 12:47.932
AND, UH... HERE.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.567
WHAT'S THAT FOR?

12:49.569 --> 12:51.169
THE TICKETS.

12:51.171 --> 12:53.438
NO, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.573
THIS IS MY TREAT.

12:55.575 --> 12:58.676
I JUST... I KNOW
HOW HARD YOU WORK.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.812
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO SPEND YOUR MONEY

13:00.814 --> 13:02.280
ON SOME STUPID DANCE.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.916
WELL, TOUGH LUCK...

13:04.918 --> 13:07.018
'CAUSE I WANT TO.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.494
I'M WEARING A SILVER
STRAPLESS DRESS.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.031
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
YOU IN IT.

13:26.773 --> 13:27.939
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

13:27.941 --> 13:28.940
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.482
THANK YOU SO MUCH, GUYS.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.616
HI!

13:38.618 --> 13:40.051
HEY.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.820
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE IN A BAND.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.489
JAZZ BAND.
I DON'T MARCH.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.424
AND, YES,
I'M VOTING FOR YOU.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.626
THANK YOU. UM...

13:51.231 --> 13:54.098
OKAY, WELL, I'LL SEE
YOU AT HOMECOMING.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.100
I DON'T THINK SO.

13:56.102 --> 14:00.371
TOO BAD. I KNOW EMILY
REALLY WANTED YOU TO COME.

14:00.373 --> 14:03.041
OH. WELL, UM...

14:04.678 --> 14:05.910
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.422
HEY.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.626
SORRY I'M LATE.

14:21.628 --> 14:23.361
WERE YOU TALKING TO HER?

14:23.363 --> 14:25.430
WHO?
EMILY.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.168
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

14:30.170 --> 14:31.502
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

14:31.504 --> 14:33.104
( scoffs ) YOU KNOW

14:33.106 --> 14:35.006
YOU'RE ONLY FOOLING
YOURSELF, RIGHT?

14:35.008 --> 14:36.875
I MEAN, ONCE
SHE FINDS OUT

14:36.877 --> 14:39.043
THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU,
SHE'LL HATE YOU.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.478
WHO'S GONNA TELL HER?

15:11.811 --> 15:14.012
CAREFUL WITH THAT!
ARE YOU BLIND?

15:16.049 --> 15:17.916
CAN WE HELP YOU?

15:17.918 --> 15:19.384
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

15:19.386 --> 15:21.386
BAKING A CAKE!

15:21.388 --> 15:24.589
WELL, ARE YOU GONNA
BE DONE SOON?

15:24.591 --> 15:25.523
NO!

15:33.366 --> 15:35.433
<i> Aria: HOW LONG</i>
<i> DID YOU WAIT?</i>

15:35.435 --> 15:39.203
I FINALLY LEFT WHEN CHEWY'S
FIVE-'O-CLOCK SHADOW
TURNED INTO A BEARD.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.406
DID YOU TELL SPENCER?

15:41.408 --> 15:43.141
RELAX. I RIGGED
THE DOOR SO WE

15:43.143 --> 15:44.776
CAN GET BACK INSIDE
LATER THIS WEEKEND.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.210
HEY, DO YOU
HAVE ANYTHING

15:46.212 --> 15:47.245
A LITTLE LESS HIPPIE

15:47.247 --> 15:48.579
AND A LITTLE
MORE BOURGIE?

15:48.581 --> 15:50.114
WHATEVER'S IN THERE
IS WHAT I HAVE.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.449
OKAY, SO,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.418
"IT'S AN HONOR
JUST TO BE NOMINATED,"

15:53.420 --> 15:55.386
OR "IT'S ABOUT TIME.
WHERE'S MY THRONE?"

15:57.724 --> 15:59.857
THEY BOTH LOOK GOOD.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.431
ARIA, I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

16:06.433 --> 16:09.300
WHEN MY PARENTS
WERE FIGHTING,
I BARELY LEFT MY ROOM.

16:09.302 --> 16:13.271
I WORE MY HEADPHONES
AND BLASTED JAY-Z
TO DROWN THEM OUT.

16:13.273 --> 16:16.441
IT GOT TO THE POINT
WHERE I'D ONLY TAKE
THEM OFF TO SHOWER.

16:16.443 --> 16:20.411
LIKE, THE WORST PART
IS NOW, WAITING,

16:20.413 --> 16:23.114
WHICH IS WHY YOU NEED
TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.016
WE WILL HAVE
AN AMAZING TIME TONIGHT,

16:25.018 --> 16:27.952
AND I KNOW SOMEONE WHO
HAS A HUGE CRUSH ON YOU.

16:27.954 --> 16:29.387
WHO?

16:29.389 --> 16:30.521
CHRIS BUZZINI.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.490
I THOUGHT
HE WAS BRINGING LISA.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.159
HE IS, BUT HE TOLD SEAN
HE'D RATHER TAKE YOU.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.961
HE JUST THINKS
YOU'RE NOT INTO HIM.

16:36.963 --> 16:39.130
WELL, I'M-- I'M NOT.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.431
SO WHO ARE YOU INTO?

16:43.470 --> 16:45.636
OH, MY GOSH,
I KNEW IT!

16:45.638 --> 16:48.473
YOU'RE ALREADY
SEEING SOMEONE.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.074
NO!

16:50.076 --> 16:52.810
YES, YOU MET SOMEONE
WHEN YOU WERE LIVING
IN ICELAND.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.412
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

16:54.414 --> 16:55.913
FORGET IT.
I PROBABLY CAN'T

16:55.915 --> 16:57.815
PRONOUNCE IT,
ANYWAYS.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.418
LOOK, ARIA, THIS GUY
MAY BE CUTE AND ALL,

17:00.420 --> 17:03.187
BUT THAT BOOTY CALL
IS A LONG DISTANCE.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.056
IT'S TIME
TO SAY GOOD-BYE

17:05.058 --> 17:07.025
TO YOUR VIKING
AND MOVE ON.

17:07.027 --> 17:10.695
YOU'RE IN TWO COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT PLACES RIGHT NOW.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.130
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.664
OF COURSE I AM!

17:13.666 --> 17:15.666
SO, WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA WEAR,

17:15.668 --> 17:17.068
"THE BELL JAR,"

17:17.070 --> 17:18.603
OR "LET'S GET
THIS PARTY STARTED"?

17:22.108 --> 17:26.210
¶ FOR AS LONG,
LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER ¶

17:26.212 --> 17:28.880
¶ IT'S BEEN DECEMBER ¶

17:28.882 --> 17:32.283
¶ NO SUN AND NO SUMMERTIME
TO TREASURE ¶

17:32.285 --> 17:34.052
¶ WE WEREN'T GROWN ¶

17:34.054 --> 17:36.687
¶ AND EVERY TIME
THAT THEY TOLD US ¶

17:36.689 --> 17:39.457
¶ "SURRENDER,
IT WILL BE BETTER" ¶

17:39.459 --> 17:43.227
¶ WE'D JUST GO HOLDING ON
TO FOREVER ¶

17:43.229 --> 17:46.230
¶ FOR WHAT WE KNOW ¶

17:46.232 --> 17:48.399
¶ BROKEN LOVER ¶

17:48.401 --> 17:51.069
¶ GUESS I MADE YOU ¶

17:51.071 --> 17:53.037
¶ BELIEVE THAT I ¶

17:53.039 --> 17:56.641
¶ WOULD BE THE ONE
TO HEAL YOU ¶

17:56.643 --> 17:59.544
¶ AND IF YOU GO NOW ¶

17:59.546 --> 18:02.146
¶ OUT THAT DOORWAY ¶

18:02.148 --> 18:03.881
HI! THERE SHE IS.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.616
I WAS WORRIED
YOU WERE GONNA BAIL.

18:05.618 --> 18:09.620
NO! NO, I'M READY TO HAVE
A FANTASTIC TIME TONIGHT.

18:09.622 --> 18:12.156
WITH NO DATE?
MY, HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.060
WHATEVER. SHE CAN
SHARE MY DATE.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.096
YEAH. I HAVE
NO PROBLEM WITH THAT.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.697
AND MINE.
YEAH.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.199
HEY, I'M ARIA.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.533
ALEX. NICE TO MEET YOU.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.068
YOU TOO.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.003
UNFORTUNATELY,
YOU HAVE TO WORK
BEFORE YOU CAN PLAY,

18:26.005 --> 18:28.906
'CAUSE YOU'VE GOT
THE FIRST SHIFT
AT THE BEANBAG TOSS!

18:28.908 --> 18:30.108
YOU'RE A HERO.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.348
UM, WILL YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR JUST ONE SEC?

18:37.350 --> 18:38.683
YEAH, SURE.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.251
TALK TO HIM.
YEAH.

18:44.557 --> 18:47.425
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU, TOO.

18:47.427 --> 18:48.860
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

18:48.862 --> 18:50.595
NICE TO SEE YOU,
TOO, SIS.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.730
NO, SERIOUSLY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:52.732 --> 18:54.599
I WAS ASKED.
THE ALUMNI HAS

18:54.601 --> 18:56.567
A FORMER HOMECOMING QUEEN
PRESENT THE CROWN.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.637
RIGHT, AND THIS YEAR
IT'S SOME CHICK
FROM THE CLASS OF 2000.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.105
I'M FILLING IN.

19:01.107 --> 19:04.475
APPARENTLY SHE'S BEEN
VOMITING SINCE THURSDAY.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.644
GREAT.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.279
OH, BY THE WAY...

19:08.281 --> 19:10.615
THEY POSTED THE WINNING
GOLDEN ORCHID ESSAYS ONLINE,

19:10.617 --> 19:13.151
AND I HAD A CHANCE
TO READ YOURS...

19:13.153 --> 19:14.886
OR, SHOULD I SAY, MINE?

19:14.888 --> 19:17.188
LOOK, I'VE ALREADY
TOLD MOM AND DAD,

19:17.190 --> 19:18.723
AND THEY THINK
A RETRACTION

19:18.725 --> 19:20.958
WOULD BE MORE OF
AN EMBARRASSMENT FOR US.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.294
IT WAS A REALLY
STUPID THING TO DO,

19:23.296 --> 19:24.962
AND I'M SO SORRY--
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.564
YOU NEVER ARE.

19:26.566 --> 19:28.432
HEY, TRISH.

19:34.340 --> 19:37.308
UGH, THAT'S AWFUL!
IS THAT BECKY NEWMAN?

19:37.310 --> 19:39.577
IT LOOKS LIKE HER HAIR
GOT IN A FIGHT

19:39.579 --> 19:41.445
WITH HER FACE
AND THEY BOTH LOST.

19:45.718 --> 19:49.687
YEARBOOK PICTURES! HEY.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.689
HEY. NICE BOWTIE.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.659
OH, THANKS.
IT'S MY GRANDPA'S.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.228
HEY. I'M LUCAS.

19:57.230 --> 20:00.331
GREAT. CAN YOU BE LUCAS
OVER THERE?

20:00.333 --> 20:03.034
( chuckles ) UM...

20:05.138 --> 20:06.504
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND, HANNA.

20:06.506 --> 20:08.406
YEAH, SEE YOU AROUND.
HAVE FUN.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.011
RUDE MUCH?

20:14.013 --> 20:15.947
AM I IN
A PARALLEL UNIVERSE,

20:15.949 --> 20:18.149
OR DID YOU JUST ENGAGE
IN CONVERSATION

20:18.151 --> 20:20.718
WITH HERMIE-- ISN'T THAT
WHAT ALISON CALLED HIM?

20:20.720 --> 20:22.887
HE IS NOT
A HERMAPHRODITE, OKAY?

20:22.889 --> 20:24.288
HE'S A NICE GUY.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.390
SAYING HI TO HIM'S
NOT A CRIME.

20:26.392 --> 20:27.692
IT SHOULD BE.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.794
YOU DIDN'T BUST YOUR ASS
TO BECOME ROSEWOOD'S

20:29.796 --> 20:31.662
"IT GIRL" JUST TO MAKE
CHIT-CHAT WITH SHIM.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.933
IF YOU AND I START
SLIPPING UP, WE'RE

20:35.935 --> 20:38.002
GONNA BE RIGHT BACK
AT THE BOTTOM AGAIN.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.404
YEAH, WELL, I'M STARTING
TO THINK I'VE LOST

20:40.406 --> 20:42.039
A FEW THINGS
ON THE CLIMB UP.

20:45.612 --> 20:49.547
LOOK, YOU CAN GO
KAMIKAZE IF YOU WANT,

20:49.549 --> 20:51.449
BUT I WILL CUT
YOUR RIP CORD

20:51.451 --> 20:53.417
BEFORE I LET YOU
DRAG ME DOWN WITH YOU.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.735
HELLO?

21:17.644 --> 21:19.110
HEY.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.245
HI, I'M MELISSA,
SPENCER'S SISTER.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.680
ALEX. NICE TO MEET YOU.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.148
WE'VE MET.
AT THE CLUB.

21:24.150 --> 21:26.917
ARE YOU ON THE HOMECOMING
COMMITTEE, AS WELL?

21:26.919 --> 21:29.287
ALEX DOESN'T GO HERE.
HE GOES TO SCHOOL ACROSS TOWN.

21:29.289 --> 21:30.288
WHERE DO YOU GO?

21:30.290 --> 21:32.123
P.S. 187 ON ELMHURST.

21:32.125 --> 21:34.125
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE HEARD
OF IT, MELISSA.

21:34.127 --> 21:36.694
IT'S NOT IN THE SAME ZIP CODE
AS THE PRADA OUTLET.

21:43.269 --> 21:44.902
UM, CATERING CRISIS.

21:47.240 --> 21:49.573
BUT--
BYE.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.980
I DIDN'T PLAN THIS.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.249
I ALREADY SAID
I BELIEVE YOU.

21:58.251 --> 21:59.984
YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.019
I DO. CAN YOU HAND ME
THOSE, PLEASE?

22:07.894 --> 22:09.160
HEY, NICE HAIRCUT.

22:10.596 --> 22:12.229
THANKS.

22:19.772 --> 22:21.706
GREAT. WELL DONE.

22:27.980 --> 22:30.014
I DIDN'T TELL ANYONE
ABOUT US.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.782
LET'S JUST
DROP THIS, OKAY?

22:31.784 --> 22:33.517
I'M JUST GRATEFUL
IT ENDED BEFORE

22:33.519 --> 22:35.353
ONE OF US
GOT SERIOUSLY HURT.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.621
TOO LATE FOR THAT.

22:40.093 --> 22:41.759
IT WASN'T A FRIEND
WHO SENT THAT TEXT.

22:44.097 --> 22:45.096
HI.

22:50.236 --> 22:51.469
OH, WELL,
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.404
YOU JUST MISSED IT,
BUT THERE YOU GO.

22:53.406 --> 22:55.539
HAVE A GOOD ONE,
REST OF YOUR NIGHT.

22:55.541 --> 22:56.841
SO...

22:56.843 --> 22:58.676
WHO'S "A"?

22:58.678 --> 23:01.912
IT'S SOMEONE
WHO'S MESSING WITH ME.

23:01.914 --> 23:04.248
ARIA, WHY WOULD SOMEONE
WANT TO MESS WITH YOU?

23:10.056 --> 23:12.156
BECAUSE LAST SUMMER...

23:16.095 --> 23:17.094
I DON'T KNOW.

23:18.831 --> 23:20.865
IT'S COMPLICATED.

23:20.867 --> 23:23.501
IF YOU'VE HAD ENOUGH,
I'D BE HAPPY TO RELIEVE YOU.

23:23.503 --> 23:26.537
OH, THANKS,
MS. WELCH. I'M FINE.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.905
I WAS TALKING
TO HER.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.876
OH, I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.380
SO, WHO'S UP?

23:44.056 --> 23:46.724
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE SHOWING
A FRITZ LANG DOUBLE FEATURE

23:46.726 --> 23:48.893
AT ROSEWOOD CINEMA TONIGHT.

23:48.895 --> 23:51.128
IF WE LEAVE NOW,
WE'LL ONLY MISS THE CREDITS.

23:53.032 --> 23:55.166
I... MIGHT BE
A LITTLE OVERDRESSED.

23:58.371 --> 24:01.205
THIS MAY SOUND STUPID,
BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN

24:01.207 --> 24:02.973
TO ONE OF THESE
THINGS BEFORE.

24:02.975 --> 24:06.610
WHAT ARE YOU
SO NERVOUS ABOUT?

24:06.612 --> 24:08.212
MEETING UP
WITH MY FRIENDS?

24:08.214 --> 24:09.780
WHO THINK I'M A FREAK.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.248
NOT ALL THEM.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.284
I MEAN, THEY'LL
GET OVER IT

24:13.286 --> 24:15.186
BECAUSE THEY WANT
ME TO BE HAPPY.

24:18.224 --> 24:19.657
IT'S JUST A PARTY.

24:19.659 --> 24:22.026
YOU KNOW, IF WE GET HUNGRY,
WE EAT SOME CHIPS,

24:22.028 --> 24:23.794
HAVE SOME PUNCH...

24:23.796 --> 24:26.330
PUNCH, REALLY?

24:26.332 --> 24:28.098
ARE WE GONNA
JITTERBUG, TOO?

24:28.100 --> 24:30.034
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DANCE.

24:30.036 --> 24:31.602
GOOD, 'CAUSE I--
I DON'T.

24:33.172 --> 24:36.240
OKAY, SO HOW ABOUT YOU
STAND THERE AND DO THIS...

24:39.045 --> 24:41.679
AND I'LL DANCE
AROUND YOU.

24:41.681 --> 24:44.548
I THINK I'D RATHER
DRINK THE PUNCH.

24:44.550 --> 24:45.516
OKAY.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.087
HEY, THAT WAS
A QUICK SHIFT.

24:50.089 --> 24:51.255
YOU OKAY?

24:51.257 --> 24:54.658
NO, MY CLAUSTROPHOBIA
KICKED IN.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.228
CAN YOU FIND SOMEONE
TO TAKE MY PLACE?

24:57.230 --> 24:59.196
YEAH. ALONE IN
A DARK BOOTH WITH FITZ?

24:59.198 --> 25:01.332
IT'S, LIKE, EVERY
FRESHMAN GIRL'S DREAM.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.466
HEY, HANNA.

25:02.468 --> 25:04.635
HI! HEY.
HEY.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.237
UM, HAVE YOU GUYS
SEEN EMILY AROUND?

25:06.239 --> 25:07.505
NO, I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO TEXT HER.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.542
DON'T BOTHER.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.518
( song ends; applause )

25:45.044 --> 25:46.176
HEY, GUYS.

25:50.283 --> 25:51.849
I'LL GO GET US SOME DRINKS.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.122
YOU'RE HERE
WITH TOBY?

25:58.124 --> 25:59.590
EITHER YOU'VE GOT
SOME GENIUS PLAN

25:59.592 --> 26:00.824
OF SLEEPING
WITH THE ENEMY,

26:00.826 --> 26:02.126
OR YOU'VE LOST
YOUR MIND!

26:02.128 --> 26:03.327
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

26:03.329 --> 26:04.628
Spencer: WHAT IS
THERE TO KNOW?

26:04.630 --> 26:06.030
WHO ELSE COULD'VE
HELPED JENNA?

26:06.032 --> 26:08.132
HE HAS EVERY REASON
TO HATE US.
HE DOESN'T.

26:08.134 --> 26:10.634
EMILY, IF IT WALKS LIKE A DUCK
AND QUACKS LIKE A DUCK,
IT'S A FRICKING DUCK.

26:10.636 --> 26:13.804
WOW. I THOUGHT AT LEAST
YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

26:18.110 --> 26:19.610
EMILY, WAIT.

26:19.612 --> 26:21.111
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

26:21.113 --> 26:23.447
AREN'T YOU THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
TO FOLLOW MY FEELINGS

26:23.449 --> 26:25.649
AND NOT TO LET OTHER PEOPLE'S
OPINIONS STOP ME?

26:25.651 --> 26:28.786
YES, YES, I DID,
BUT THAT WAS WHEN I THOUGHT
YOU WERE TAKING MAYA.

26:28.788 --> 26:31.822
MAYA?! WHY WOULD
I TAKE MAYA?

26:33.926 --> 26:34.925
HEY.

26:38.965 --> 26:41.932
YOU WANNA GO
PLAY SOME GAMES?

26:41.934 --> 26:43.601
SURE.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.846
Melissa: SO, DID YOU BUY
A RAFFLE TICKET YET?

26:55.848 --> 26:57.715
NOT YET.

26:57.717 --> 26:59.850
WHERE'S SPENCER?

26:59.852 --> 27:01.952
DID SHE LEAVE YOU
ALL ALONE?

27:01.954 --> 27:04.054
IT'S COOL.
I LIKE PEOPLE-WATCHING.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.656
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

27:05.658 --> 27:08.359
I MEAN, MOST GUYS
WOULD BE UNCOMFORTABLE

27:08.361 --> 27:11.495
BEING... USED LIKE THIS,
BUT IF YOU'RE NOT,

27:11.497 --> 27:13.831
THEN NO ONE'S
GETTING HURT.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.966
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.468
I'M TALKING ABOUT SPENCER,

27:17.470 --> 27:19.837
YOU KNOW, DATING YOU
TO PISS OFF OUR DAD.

27:19.839 --> 27:23.307
SHE'S ALWAYS
TRYING SOMETHING NEW
TO MAKE HIM CRAZY.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.580
YOU REALLY SHOULD
BUY A TICKET.

27:29.582 --> 27:31.448
THAT IS
A BEAUTIFUL CAR.

27:36.555 --> 27:38.088
DID I MISS SOMETHING?

27:38.090 --> 27:40.391
WHEN DID SHE START
HANGING OUT WITH TOBY?

27:40.393 --> 27:42.893
I HAVE NO IDEA.
I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN
HER TALK TO HIM.

27:44.430 --> 27:45.696
THERE YOU ARE.

27:45.698 --> 27:47.064
YOU KEEP
DISAPPEARING ON US.

27:47.066 --> 27:49.433
YEAH, WE...
HAD TO... GET ICE.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.536
HEY, WANNA DANCE?

27:52.538 --> 27:54.338
LET'S DO IT.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.363
WHAT'S WRONG?

28:53.365 --> 28:54.832
NOTHING. I'LL
BE RIGHT BACK.

28:56.202 --> 28:59.236
ARIA? I'M SORRY.
CAN YOU COME HERE?

28:59.238 --> 29:01.071
PLEASE, HANNA.
I'M SORRY.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.878
I FIGURED OUT
WHAT TOBY'S TATTOO MEANS.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.180
WHAT?
"901 FREE AT LAST?"

29:10.182 --> 29:11.615
IT'S SEPTEMBER 1st.

29:11.617 --> 29:12.916
THAT'S THE DAY
ALI DISAPPEARED.

29:16.756 --> 29:18.255
HANNA, YOU'VE GOTTA
GET THAT FILE.

29:18.257 --> 29:19.757
TONIGHT?

29:19.759 --> 29:21.358
EMILY'S NOT GOING
TO BELIEVE US WITHOUT PROOF.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.060
SHE COULD BE WALKING
INTO A TRAP.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.795
COULD WE DO IT
AFTER THEY ANNOUNCE

29:24.797 --> 29:26.597
THE HOMECOMING
QUEEN? PLEASE.

29:26.599 --> 29:28.465
OKAY, FINE. FINE.
I'LL GET IT.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.434
KEEP AN EYE ON EMILY
UNTIL I GET THE FILE.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.602
WAIT, WHAT ABOUT ME?

29:31.604 --> 29:33.637
KEEP AN EYE ON SEAN.
WHAT?

29:33.639 --> 29:35.239
I CAN'T EXACTLY TELL HIM
WHERE I'M GOING.

29:35.241 --> 29:37.341
IF I MAKE SOMETHING UP,
HE'LL WANT TO COME WITH ME.

29:37.343 --> 29:38.342
JUST KEEP HIM BUSY.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.043
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

29:40.045 --> 29:42.546
I DON'T KNOW.
JUST FIGURE IT OUT.

29:42.548 --> 29:43.680
COME ON.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.258
SPENCER, WANNA GO
TO THE FORTUNE TELLER?

29:54.260 --> 29:55.492
SPENCER.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.927
WHAT?

29:56.929 --> 29:59.196
I ASKED IF YOU WANTED TO
GO TO THE FORTUNE TELLER.

29:59.198 --> 30:02.866
UM, NO, I DON'T
REALLY THINK SO.

30:02.868 --> 30:06.170
IT'S NOT REALLY
MY KIND OF THING.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.437
YOU KNOW,
ON SECOND THOUGHT,

30:07.439 --> 30:08.672
IT MIGHT BE
KIND OF FUN.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.643
SEAN, HEY.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.845
HEY. WHERE'S HANNA?

30:14.847 --> 30:17.114
OH, SHE'S WITH SPENCER,
GETTING SOME MORE ICE.

30:17.116 --> 30:20.584
MORE? IS THERE A HEAT WAVE
GOING ON IN HERE?

30:20.586 --> 30:22.352
OH, RIGHT!

30:22.354 --> 30:24.488
RIGHT, SHE ACTUALLY SAID
THAT THERE WAS...

30:24.490 --> 30:28.625
UH, A CRISIS
WITH THE BAND OR...

30:28.627 --> 30:30.661
DO YOU WANT SOME FOOD?

30:30.663 --> 30:33.397
HI, COULD I GET A CAB
TO ROSEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL, PLEASE?

30:33.399 --> 30:34.998
GREAT. THANKS.

30:38.904 --> 30:40.070
HEY.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.172
THE HOMECOMING QUEEN
IS LEAVING?

30:42.174 --> 30:45.275
NOMINEE, AND YEAH,
SORT OF.

30:45.277 --> 30:48.312
ISN'T THAT KIND OF LIKE
HAN SOLO ABANDONING
THE<i> MILLENNIUM FALCON?</i>

30:48.314 --> 30:51.081
UH, HONESTLY,
I HAVE NO IDEA.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.916
WHY ARE YOU LEAVING?

30:52.918 --> 30:54.918
GOT ENOUGH PHOTOS
FOR THE YEARBOOK.

30:54.920 --> 30:57.454
YOU CAME JUST
TO TAKE PHOTOS?

30:57.456 --> 31:00.524
YEAH. AND TO CAST
MY VOTE FOR YOU.

31:05.030 --> 31:07.598
LISTEN, UM, I LEFT
A CHECK FOR THE BAND

31:07.600 --> 31:08.932
AT THE OFFICE
WHERE I WORK.

31:08.934 --> 31:10.601
WOULD YOU MIND DRIVING
ME THERE AND BACK?

31:10.603 --> 31:13.203
IT'S EITHER THAT
OR WATCH

31:13.205 --> 31:16.240
THE NEW<i> HOARDERS</i> EPISODE
WITH MY PARENTS, SO YEAH.

31:16.242 --> 31:18.342
HERE, UH, YOU LOOK COLD.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.143
THANK YOU.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.578
LET'S GO.

31:21.580 --> 31:24.982
<i> THERE'S A LOT</i>
<i> OF ANXIETY IN THESE CARDS.</i>

31:24.984 --> 31:26.316
ARE YOU A WORRIER?

31:28.220 --> 31:29.219
SPENCER?

31:31.457 --> 31:32.656
HMM?

31:32.658 --> 31:33.924
QUESTION.

31:33.926 --> 31:36.126
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

31:36.128 --> 31:39.129
THIS INDICATES
A JOURNEY.

31:39.131 --> 31:40.664
IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER
IT'S A JOURNEY

31:40.666 --> 31:42.366
FROM THE PAST
OR IN THE FUTURE,

31:42.368 --> 31:44.434
BUT I'M SEEING
AN IMAGE.

31:44.436 --> 31:46.436
YOU COULD BE
TAKING CARE OF SOMEONE.

31:46.438 --> 31:47.871
THEY COULD BE... HURT.

31:50.476 --> 31:51.808
WHAT ELSE
DO THEY SAY?

31:51.810 --> 31:53.243
YOU KNOW, THIS IS
TYPICAL HANNA.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.811
SHE MAKES A BIG DEAL
ABOUT COMING

31:54.813 --> 31:56.813
TO THIS THING TOGETHER,
AND THEN SHE DITCHES ME.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.282
LET'S DANCE.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.050
COME ON.

32:00.052 --> 32:01.985
COME ON,
I LOVE THIS SONG.

32:01.987 --> 32:03.320
YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LEAVE ME

32:03.322 --> 32:04.922
TO BUMP AND GRIND
BY MYSELF, ARE YOU?

32:13.265 --> 32:15.198
I'LL BE BACK
IN A SEC, OKAY?

32:29.315 --> 32:32.516
WHAT DID YOU
TELL HANNA ABOUT US?

32:32.518 --> 32:34.217
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

32:34.219 --> 32:36.253
WHY DID SHE THINK
YOU'D BE MY DATE?

32:36.255 --> 32:38.722
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE CAME UP TO ME.

32:40.993 --> 32:43.393
SHOULDN'T YOU BE
WITH YOUR DATE?

32:43.395 --> 32:45.729
DON'T MAKE A BIG DEAL
OUT OF THIS.

32:45.731 --> 32:49.066
I'M NOT, YOU ARE,
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY,

32:49.068 --> 32:51.234
SINCE YOU'VE CLEARLY
MOVED ON, ANYWAY.

32:51.236 --> 32:53.704
I TOLD YOU
I NEEDED SPACE.

32:53.706 --> 32:56.306
YEAH, AND I'M
GIVING YOU SPACE...

32:59.478 --> 33:02.212
TO COME TO GRIPS
WITH WHO YOU ARE,

33:02.214 --> 33:04.348
NOT TO HIDE IT.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.549
I'M NOT HIDING ANYTHING.

33:05.551 --> 33:06.917
THEN LOOK ME IN THE EYE

33:06.919 --> 33:09.386
AND TELL ME YOU HAVE
NO FEELINGS FOR ME...

33:11.757 --> 33:13.757
AND I'LL LEAVE YOU
ALONE FOR GOOD.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.032
¶ LET ME DOWN EASY ¶

33:22.034 --> 33:27.771
¶ BUT STAY WITH ME TONIGHT ¶

33:27.773 --> 33:29.973
¶ SAID YOU DON'T NEED ME ¶

33:29.975 --> 33:35.212
¶ BUT STAY WITH ME TONIGHT ¶

33:35.214 --> 33:37.481
¶ LET ME DOWN EASY ¶

33:37.483 --> 33:40.317
¶ BUT STAY WITH ME TONIGHT ¶

33:40.319 --> 33:42.919
¶ TONIGHT ¶

33:42.921 --> 33:45.255
¶ SAID YOU DON'T NEED ME ¶

33:45.257 --> 33:47.824
WHEN THE GENII CARD
IS REVERSED,

33:47.826 --> 33:50.127
IT INDICATES SOMETHING
FROM WHICH YOU ARE RUNNING AWAY.

34:00.773 --> 34:03.073
THE LOVERS
IS A JOYFUL CARD,

34:03.075 --> 34:04.841
BUT PAIRED WITH JUDGMENT,

34:04.843 --> 34:06.977
IT MEANS THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THIS COUPLE.

34:06.979 --> 34:08.211
IT'S A BAD MATCH.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.213
HERE, THERE'S
DARKNESS IN HIM,

34:10.215 --> 34:12.749
MAYBE EVEN VIOLENCE
OR VENGEANCE.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.623
WHERE DID THIS
COME FROM?

34:32.571 --> 34:33.703
EZRA, WAIT!

34:36.775 --> 34:39.309
JUST LET ME TALK
FOR A SECOND, PLEASE.

34:39.311 --> 34:42.145
I DON'T WANT TO ARGUE
OR TRY TO CONVINCE YOU--

34:42.147 --> 34:45.048
I KNOW IT'S OVER,
I KNOW THAT!

34:48.287 --> 34:50.821
BUT-- I JUST,
I CAN'T STAND THE IDEA

34:50.823 --> 34:53.356
OF YOU WALKING AROUND
AND HATING ME.

34:53.358 --> 34:54.825
HATE YOU?

34:54.827 --> 34:57.227
THE ONLY PERSON
I HATE RIGHT NOW

34:57.229 --> 35:00.130
IS MYSELF FOR ASKING
TOO MUCH OF YOU.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.665
SEEING YOU
OUT THERE TONIGHT,

35:01.667 --> 35:02.933
OUT ON
THE DANCE FLOOR,

35:02.935 --> 35:04.634
HAVING FUN WITH GUYS
YOUR OWN AGE,

35:04.636 --> 35:07.304
NOT SNEAKING AROUND
AND HOLING UP

35:07.306 --> 35:08.705
WITH ME
IN MY APARTMENT

35:08.707 --> 35:10.674
TO WATCH VIDEOS
AND EAT ONE

35:10.676 --> 35:12.642
OF THE THREE THINGS
I CAN ACTUALLY COOK?

35:12.644 --> 35:14.010
BECAUSE...

35:17.416 --> 35:19.683
BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE YOU
TO THE MOVIES.

35:19.685 --> 35:23.019
I CAN'T TAKE YOU OUT
TO A NICE RESTAURANT,

35:23.021 --> 35:24.921
AND FOR THE RECORD...

35:28.894 --> 35:31.194
I COULD NEVER HATE YOU.

35:31.196 --> 35:33.130
I FIGURED YOU'D
BE HERE TONIGHT.

35:35.167 --> 35:37.734
THE NEW HAIRCUT
WASN'T TO IMPRESS
MRS. WELCH.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.508
I GOTTA GO.

36:01.994 --> 36:06.029
CAN YOU WAIT HERE?
I'LL ONLY BE A COUPLE
OF MINUTES, OKAY?

36:06.031 --> 36:07.430
OH, YEAH,
TAKE YOUR TIME.

36:07.432 --> 36:10.267
<i> HOARDERS</i> ALWAYS HAS,
YOU KNOW, TWO CASES.

36:34.459 --> 36:35.625
YOU OKAY?

36:40.699 --> 36:43.200
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?

36:43.202 --> 36:44.367
( revelers shouting )

36:52.878 --> 36:55.712
WHY DON'T WE GO UPSTAIRS
TO THE CHEM LAB?

36:55.714 --> 36:57.781
IT'S QUIET UP THERE.

37:07.926 --> 37:09.025
<i> Alex: WHAT'S GOING ON?</i>

37:10.229 --> 37:11.962
YOU SEEM DISTRACTED.

37:11.964 --> 37:13.597
( phone ringing )

37:14.900 --> 37:16.967
I'M SORRY.

37:16.969 --> 37:20.270
I'M SO SORRY.
I PROMISE, THIS IS
THE LAST TIME.

37:20.272 --> 37:22.272
THE PHONE'S
NOT THE PROBLEM.

37:22.274 --> 37:24.774
MAYBE MY WORK
FOR THE NIGHT'S DONE.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.476
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

37:26.478 --> 37:28.878
JUST GO AHEAD. ANSWER IT.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.748
I'M SORRY.
I'LL JUST BE A MINUTE.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.183
SORRY.

37:33.185 --> 37:34.618
WHAT IS IT?

37:34.620 --> 37:36.820
HEY, I'M LOOKING THROUGH
THE ENTIRE "M" SECTION,

37:36.822 --> 37:39.022
AND THERE'S
NO JENNA MARSHALL.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.323
WELL, CHECK
UNDER CAVANAUGH.

37:40.325 --> 37:41.558
SHE'S TOBY'S
STEPSISTER.

37:41.560 --> 37:42.792
MAYBE HIS DAD
ADOPTED HER.

37:42.794 --> 37:45.061
HEY, MY PHONE'S DYING.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

37:45.063 --> 37:47.130
<i> I SAID CHECK</i>
<i> UNDER CAVANAUGH!</i>

37:47.132 --> 37:49.966
BUT WHAT IF THE--

37:49.968 --> 37:50.934
HANNA!

37:55.807 --> 37:57.607
WHERE'S ALEX?

37:57.609 --> 37:58.842
HE LEFT.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.143
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

38:00.145 --> 38:02.279
HE LEFT.

38:02.281 --> 38:04.147
DO YOU NEED ME
TO TWEET IT TO YOU?

38:04.149 --> 38:05.415
WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO HIM?

38:05.417 --> 38:06.950
I DIDN'T HAVE
TO SAY MUCH.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.818
YOU SCREWED UP THIS ONE
ALL BY YOURSELF.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.316
IT'S SO WEIRD
TO BE HERE AT NIGHT.

38:41.353 --> 38:43.453
WANNA TALK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

38:45.457 --> 38:47.590
I JUST GOT UPSET.

38:47.592 --> 38:49.459
DID IT HAVE TO DO
WITH MAYA?

38:49.461 --> 38:50.794
NO.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.966
YES.

38:56.968 --> 38:59.135
EMILY...

38:59.137 --> 39:01.304
DID YOU COME WITH
THE WRONG PERSON TO HOMECOMING?

39:04.409 --> 39:05.909
MAYBE.

39:08.146 --> 39:10.046
I UNDERSTAND.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.216
WHY DO YOU LIKE ME?

39:13.218 --> 39:14.451
WHAT?

39:14.453 --> 39:16.419
WHY ARE YOU SO NICE
TO ME WHEN--

39:16.421 --> 39:19.155
WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT ME
AND MY FRIENDS DID?

39:21.593 --> 39:23.727
OH.

39:23.729 --> 39:27.330
I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE
I'VE ALSO DONE THINGS
THAT I'M NOT PROUD OF.

39:31.770 --> 39:34.237
WE'VE ALL GOT
SECRETS, EMILY.

39:39.811 --> 39:42.679
AND DON'T FORGET
TO BUY YOUR RAFFLE TICKETS

39:42.681 --> 39:45.448
FOR A CHANCE TO WIN
A BRAND-NEW TOYOTA COROLLA.

39:45.450 --> 39:48.251
THAT IS ONE SWEET RIDE.

39:48.253 --> 39:50.053
AND NOW, FOR THE REASON
WE'RE ALL HERE.

39:50.055 --> 39:53.256
I CAN STILL REMEMBER
THE FEELING OF JOY I HAD WHEN,

39:53.258 --> 39:56.659
AS A ROSEWOOD STUDENT,
I HEARD MY NAME CALLED.

39:56.661 --> 40:00.263
PLEASE WELCOME YOUR NEW
HOMECOMING KING AND QUEEN,

40:00.265 --> 40:03.166
SEAN ACKARD
AND HANNA MARIN!

40:09.374 --> 40:11.775
SEAN ACKARD
AND HANNA MARIN!

40:16.214 --> 40:17.647
IS THAT JENNA'S FILE?

40:17.649 --> 40:18.982
NO, I GOT TOBY'S.

40:18.984 --> 40:21.050
TURNS OUT JENNA
WASN'T THE PATIENT.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.886
THE THERAPIST HAD HER
COME IN FOR ONE SESSION

40:22.888 --> 40:24.988
TO SEE HOW SHE FELT ABOUT
TOBY COMING BACK HOME.

40:24.990 --> 40:28.191
OH, MY GOD.
WELL, WHAT ELSE DOES IT SAY?

40:28.193 --> 40:31.594
WELL, THE DATES PROVE
HE WASN'T AWAY AT SCHOOL
WHEN ALI DISAPPEARED.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.062
HE WAS STILL HERE
IN ROSEWOOD.

40:33.064 --> 40:34.431
WHAT ELSE?

40:34.433 --> 40:35.665
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

40:36.902 --> 40:39.769
SESSION 12, AUGUST 15th.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.638
THINK I DIDN'T SEE WHAT
WAS GOING ON IN THERE?

40:41.640 --> 40:42.939
IT'S NOT WHAT
IT LOOKED LIKE.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.073
MAYBE NOT TO YOU.

40:44.075 --> 40:45.241
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE, ANYWAY?

40:45.243 --> 40:46.776
WHAT THE HELL DID I
EVER DO TO YOU?

40:46.778 --> 40:48.278
YOU'VE BEEN PEEPING
IN MY WINDOW FOR YEARS.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.512
I NEVER LOOKED
IN YOUR WINDOW.

40:49.514 --> 40:51.014
WELL, I'VE LOOKED
IN YOURS,

40:51.016 --> 40:52.549
AND WE'RE NOT TAKING
THE BLAME FOR THIS.

40:52.551 --> 40:53.983
OH, YES, YOU ARE.

40:53.985 --> 40:56.519
NO, NOT UNLESS YOU WANT
THE ENTIRE WORLD TO KNOW

40:56.521 --> 40:58.655
HOW CLOSE YOU ARE
WITH YOUR STEPSISTER.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.390
YOU TALK, AND I'LL MAKE SURE

41:00.392 --> 41:02.725
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'VE
BEEN DOING IT WITH HER.

41:02.727 --> 41:05.094
SO THAT'S WHAT ALI
HAD ON HIM?

41:05.096 --> 41:06.830
IT'S ENOUGH
TO WANT HER DEAD.

41:06.832 --> 41:07.831
AND US.

41:09.501 --> 41:10.500
EMILY!

41:16.842 --> 41:18.641
( phone ringing )

41:20.378 --> 41:22.045
CAN YOU PLEASE
NOT ANSWER THAT?

41:22.047 --> 41:24.047
WHY?

41:24.049 --> 41:25.715
BECAUSE I'M TRYING
TO FIND A WAY

41:25.717 --> 41:27.650
TO TELL YOU ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED LAST SUMMER.

41:27.652 --> 41:29.452
( ringing )

41:29.454 --> 41:31.354
I WANT YOU
TO HEAR IT FROM ME.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.592
SHE'S NOT PICKING UP.
TEXT HER!

41:37.562 --> 41:39.896
WE HAVE TO FIND HER.
COME ON!

41:46.037 --> 41:48.705
TOBY, YOU'RE SCARING ME.

41:48.707 --> 41:50.206
PLEASE STOP.

41:50.208 --> 41:51.908
I HAVEN'T SAID
ANYTHING YET.

41:51.910 --> 41:53.510
PLEASE STOP TALKING.

41:53.512 --> 41:56.379
SO, YOU'RE ALLOWED TO BE
HONEST, BUT I'M NOT?

41:56.381 --> 41:58.147
( message tone beeps )

42:00.318 --> 42:02.752
WHO'S THAT FROM?

42:02.754 --> 42:04.087
IS THAT FROM
ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS?

42:04.089 --> 42:06.155
I'VE GOTTA GO.
WHY? WAIT.

42:06.157 --> 42:07.991
NO, I'VE GOTTA GO.
WAIT. JUST HEAR ME OUT!

42:28.213 --> 42:30.113
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

42:30.115 --> 42:32.115
EMILY, WAIT!

42:36.821 --> 42:38.354
WHERE IS SHE?

42:38.356 --> 42:39.822
MAYBE THEY LEFT.

42:39.824 --> 42:42.559
( sobbing )
SOMEBODY HELP ME, PLEASE!

42:42.561 --> 42:46.329
( chatter )

42:46.331 --> 42:48.298
Emily: GET AWAY FROM ME!
( gasps )

42:48.300 --> 42:49.265
THAT'S HER.

42:50.769 --> 42:52.569
SOMEBODY HELP! SOMEBODY!
EMILY!

42:55.440 --> 42:56.973
