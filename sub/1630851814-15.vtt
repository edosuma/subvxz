WEBVTT

00:50.675 --> 00:53.052
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION
BASED IN A DYSTOPIAN KOREA

00:53.136 --> 00:55.597
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

01:53.196 --> 01:54.364
Judge Kang.

01:54.447 --> 01:57.700
The Ministry of Justice
has just ordered a stay of execution.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.620
On whose orders?

02:00.703 --> 02:03.665
Judge Kim Ga-on
held a press conference just now.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.175
<i>All trials</i>

02:15.301 --> 02:16.386
<i>of the </i>Live Court Show

02:17.637 --> 02:19.139
<i>were manipulated.</i>

02:23.226 --> 02:24.644
Please tell us more in detail.

02:24.727 --> 02:27.564
Are you saying that Judge Kang has been
manipulating the trials all this time?

02:36.573 --> 02:38.241
Let me answer that question.

02:39.909 --> 02:43.538
<i>Yes, it's true Judge Kang Yo-han
has been manipulating the trial.</i>

02:44.372 --> 02:47.333
<i>After deciding on
their conclusions in advance,</i>

02:47.417 --> 02:49.377
he forged evidence to support his stories

02:49.460 --> 02:52.505
and even bribed the counsel
to partake in his scheme.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.258
-Bribed the counsel?
-Is that real?

02:56.092 --> 02:57.135
<i>Is this all true?</i>

02:58.177 --> 03:01.890
Judge Kim Ga-on here has already
given his testimony to the Supreme Court,

03:01.973 --> 03:05.184
and a fact-finding committee
will soon be constituted.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.937
<i>Then what will become
of the Department of Live Court Show?</i>

03:08.021 --> 03:09.439
Once the truth comes to light,

03:09.522 --> 03:11.566
all trials presided over
by Judge Kang Yo-han

03:11.649 --> 03:14.903
will be invalidated
in the Court of Appeals.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.864
<i>Does that mean the department
will be disbanded?</i>

03:17.947 --> 03:19.866
<i>What will become of Judge Kang Yo-han?</i>

03:25.538 --> 03:28.917
STAY OF EXECUTION

03:29.000 --> 03:30.251
As you can see,

03:32.378 --> 03:33.796
the execution of the sentence

03:35.465 --> 03:36.716
has been halted.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.471
As for my position on this matter,

03:41.554 --> 03:44.057
I will address it in a separate statement.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.143
<i>My fellow Koreans, thank you.</i>

03:53.441 --> 03:55.193
Release the Defendant.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.838
Good work, Judge Kang.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.549
Best of luck to you,

04:20.426 --> 04:21.469
Mr. Kim.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.307
We'll be seeing each other again,
so you better look forward to it.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.285
What on earth is going on?

04:45.368 --> 04:47.161
Now they're busy attacking each other.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.623
We don't need to dirty our hands now,
Mr. President.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.376
Cheers.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.089
Anyway, as for Jukchang,

04:59.632 --> 05:01.509
he's lasted longer than I thought.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.847
I thought you promised him that
you'll cut off the power to save him.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.807
I was just saying, you know?

05:08.391 --> 05:10.268
You're a lot more innocent than you look.

05:10.351 --> 05:12.020
I was just bluffing.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.315
So no tweaking with the electric chair?

05:15.398 --> 05:17.817
Oh I did, yes.

05:18.735 --> 05:22.322
In case Jukchang failed to hang in there

05:23.781 --> 05:27.535
and opened his mouth like this,

05:27.618 --> 05:30.246
I would have turned up
the voltage to the max

05:30.330 --> 05:32.915
until he dies. That's all.

05:32.999 --> 05:36.377
Sizzle, sizzle.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.258
I must give it to you!

05:43.593 --> 05:46.637
That's why you were able to
remain so composed.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.931
I'm in awe, Mr. President.

05:51.017 --> 05:55.271
I just don't understand those guys
who pretend to be all righteous and just.

05:55.354 --> 05:57.106
They hold down each other

05:57.190 --> 06:00.735
only to trip over
after getting on their high horse

06:01.319 --> 06:03.446
until they fall to their own demise.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.657
I mean, what's with that?
I just don't get it.

06:08.576 --> 06:10.369
You should win, shouldn't you?

06:24.884 --> 06:26.135
Judge Kim.

06:28.304 --> 06:29.388
I'm sorry.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.894
Is it true? Did Judge Kang
really do such a thing?

06:36.854 --> 06:37.939
Yes.

06:38.981 --> 06:41.150
I'm sorry for keeping it from you.

06:44.737 --> 06:46.322
So I knew nothing all this time.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.787
Then what about the allegations
that he bribed Jang Ki-hyeon?

06:52.870 --> 06:54.497
Was that also true?

06:54.580 --> 06:56.541
Were Judge Kang's explanations all lies?

07:00.586 --> 07:03.840
-So I was just a background.
-Judge Oh.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.758
But even if I was, I don't care.

07:07.093 --> 07:10.263
In fact, I believed in Judge Kang.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.850
I thought he's a real judge unlike me.

07:46.549 --> 07:52.597
AFFIDAVIT

07:52.680 --> 07:56.225
OFFICE OF THE FACT-FINDING COMMITTEE

07:58.311 --> 07:59.520
<i>I…</i>

08:00.354 --> 08:02.982
<i>first met Judge Kang at…</i>

08:13.493 --> 08:14.577
<i>It's nice to meet you.</i>

08:34.680 --> 08:36.140
What is it, may I ask?

08:36.224 --> 08:39.268
It's nothing. I'm sorry.
So your name is Kim Ga-on?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.187
-Yes, I look forward--
-Welcome.

08:42.271 --> 08:43.523
To the battlefield.

08:48.903 --> 08:50.112
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

08:52.031 --> 08:53.616
Why am I doing this?

08:54.242 --> 08:55.117
Yes.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.246
-Because I can.
-Pardon?

08:58.955 --> 09:00.665
The possibility is like ecstasy.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.719
It's sad, but there is no justice
in the real world.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.930
Only a game exists.

09:16.013 --> 09:17.682
A game that's terribly unfair.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.027
AFFIDAVIT

09:43.165 --> 09:44.500
<i>This again, is it?</i>

09:45.334 --> 09:47.086
<i>Treating me like a monster?</i>

10:07.773 --> 10:11.402
<i>Ever since then,
the children called him a monster.</i>

10:16.198 --> 10:17.617
<i>One day, Yo-han will swallow</i>

10:18.951 --> 10:20.411
<i>his brother whole.</i>

10:22.079 --> 10:23.789
Yo-han, I'm worried about you.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.666
There was that incident at school too.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.710
Who knows
what you will get yourself into next?

10:27.793 --> 10:29.378
<i>I should say you're admirable.</i>

10:30.254 --> 10:32.423
After removing your idiot brother,

10:32.506 --> 10:37.345
you rescued his daughter like a hero
so you won't be suspected.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.389
Say that again.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.517
Is that why you killed your brother?

10:51.025 --> 10:54.070
That's how you should calculate.
One is a smaller number than two.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.742
Sir, don't you think you're a little
obsessed with playing with numbers?

10:59.825 --> 11:03.287
You're going to make the ruling based
on the number of votes by our audience?

11:03.371 --> 11:06.832
Do you call that "playing with numbers?"
I call it democracy.

11:15.007 --> 11:18.135
<i>All I did was to choose the fastest way</i>

11:19.345 --> 11:20.679
<i>for them.</i>

11:42.118 --> 11:43.452
Why are you here?

11:44.912 --> 11:47.123
What business could you have left with me

11:48.207 --> 11:50.459
after stabbing me in the back?

11:53.337 --> 11:55.005
I'm here to say my farewells.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.177
I told you, didn't I?

12:02.138 --> 12:05.266
That I don't want to see you
cross the point of no return.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.814
I realized everything
after seeing you in the courtroom.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.775
Getting Jukchang to talk
was just another excuse too.

12:15.359 --> 12:17.653
Whether he opened
his mouth to speak or not,

12:17.736 --> 12:20.072
you just wanted people to
get blood on their hands.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.075
Because after that,

12:24.452 --> 12:26.662
they will have no choice
but to side with you.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.457
Yes.

12:31.125 --> 12:35.212
Men are obsessed in believing
that their decision was right.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.592
Only the devil

12:41.760 --> 12:43.345
uses man's weakness against him.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.144
Say that again.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.953
This is a dog-eat-dog world.

13:08.704 --> 13:11.207
"Let's not cross the line
even though we're in battle?"

13:12.041 --> 13:13.417
You're too naive.

13:15.002 --> 13:19.590
I merely chose the fastest way.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.178
Because as humans, we hesitate.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.016
Even though we are weak,

13:29.892 --> 13:31.310
we know how to hesitate

13:32.895 --> 13:34.772
and stop ourselves because we're human.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.191
If not,

13:38.317 --> 13:40.486
we'll only be left with
the same old monsters.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.698
Those monsters indulging in self-pity.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.248
So it's that again.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.002
That's what I've been told all my life.

14:03.384 --> 14:04.718
Are you the same too?

14:08.722 --> 14:09.890
Are you scared of me?

14:20.276 --> 14:22.611
Don't you want to become
a monster like me?

14:23.487 --> 14:24.572
Well?

14:29.243 --> 14:30.828
If you want to kill me,

14:32.663 --> 14:33.789
kill me.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.095
Such a weak loser.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.894
Now get lost.

15:00.691 --> 15:01.692
I honestly wished

15:08.532 --> 15:10.701
that you would stop, Judge Kang.

16:02.419 --> 16:06.340
<i>Despite the shocking revelations
that the </i>Live Court Show<i> trials</i>

16:06.423 --> 16:09.176
<i>had been manipulated,
Judge Kang is yet to make a statement</i>

16:09.259 --> 16:10.970
<i>and continues to hold his silence.</i>

16:11.053 --> 16:13.806
<i>The recent revelations
sent the entire nation into shock</i>

16:13.889 --> 16:15.975
<i>as the </i>Live Court Show<i>
had promoted delivery of justice,</i>

16:16.058 --> 16:18.769
<i>and the negative publicity
surrounding Judge Kang</i>

16:18.852 --> 16:21.021
<i>continues to increase.</i>

16:22.356 --> 16:24.066
Did you see that?

16:24.733 --> 16:28.237
Youn-jeong, now do you see
what a great man your husband is?

16:29.029 --> 16:30.197
Of course I do, yes.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.241
And about Justice Min,

16:32.908 --> 16:34.785
he's absolutely livid right now

16:34.868 --> 16:36.870
thinking that his terrorist was

16:36.954 --> 16:38.956
one of Kang Yo-han's supporters.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.625
Yes, are the police on their way yet?

16:42.126 --> 16:43.252
This is urgent!

16:49.591 --> 16:52.261
But it was actually Jukchang!

16:53.971 --> 16:58.976
It's all because
I sowed the seeds in advance

16:59.059 --> 17:02.604
that we're seeing
my efforts come to fruition!

17:02.688 --> 17:04.773
Of course!

17:04.857 --> 17:07.026
You're the best, Honey.

17:07.776 --> 17:08.902
You're a genius!

17:10.821 --> 17:14.116
But you know, I still have regrets.
In fact, huge regrets.

17:14.199 --> 17:17.119
I should have seen some blood while at it.

17:17.202 --> 17:21.707
I ought to have used this chance to
wipe out the malcontent with tanks

17:22.416 --> 17:25.711
and leave just the patriots behind

17:25.794 --> 17:28.839
to build a great Korea
that would go down in history!

17:28.922 --> 17:30.215
Honey.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.427
Making history is great,

17:34.553 --> 17:37.347
but let's not forget
our humble beginnings.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.434
What beginnings?

17:41.185 --> 17:44.104
"A great Korea! A homogeneous Korea!"

17:45.522 --> 17:49.985
That had been our concept
when we started our show, wasn't it?

17:50.069 --> 17:52.321
I think you've become
too immersed in your role.

17:53.655 --> 17:54.823
And that worries me.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.203
Am I too much of a method actor?

17:59.286 --> 18:01.997
Let's be honest.
We came here to earn money.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.541
So let's not forget that.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.585
In the end, money is all that matters!

18:09.755 --> 18:14.176
You're right, we did talk about
how I'd become the first president

18:14.259 --> 18:16.303
to cash in on the country.

18:17.888 --> 18:21.809
But Youn-jeong, there's something
that's more important than money.

18:23.852 --> 18:26.647
What is that?

18:28.190 --> 18:30.109
To leave our mark in history.

18:30.776 --> 18:34.530
To see our names imprinted

18:34.613 --> 18:36.740
in those glorious credits called history

18:36.824 --> 18:39.034
as the eternal protagonists!

18:40.786 --> 18:43.497
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

19:05.602 --> 19:06.937
I saw the news.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.814
Did you?

19:10.858 --> 19:12.276
Are you okay?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.403
You're worried about me, are you?

19:15.195 --> 19:16.864
Worried about you? Please.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.366
If you're arrested,

19:21.827 --> 19:23.453
this house is all mine.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.917
It's always been yours from the beginning.

19:34.256 --> 19:35.716
So I guess Ga-on…

19:39.970 --> 19:41.597
won't be coming here anymore.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.851
Things are simply going back to
how it was in the beginning.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.312
And in the beginning,

19:49.605 --> 19:51.356
it was just us two, wasn't it?

20:54.002 --> 20:55.128
Cheers.

21:12.187 --> 21:13.939
-Yes, Professor.
-<i>Ga-on.</i>

21:15.315 --> 21:17.150
I can't help but think that

21:18.443 --> 21:20.654
Kang Yo-han is associated
with Su-hyeon's death.

21:22.656 --> 21:23.949
Professor.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.286
I'm telling you.
He's not someone like that.

21:29.329 --> 21:31.665
He's not someone to kill
his brother for his wealth

21:33.166 --> 21:35.419
<i>and Su-hyeon to cover it up.</i>

21:36.044 --> 21:39.089
He's not. He's not such a monster.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.717
Despite how this world views him,

21:42.718 --> 21:44.511
I know. I know that…

21:46.221 --> 21:47.556
he really is a poor soul.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.475
I see it's not that you don't believe me,

21:51.601 --> 21:53.353
but that you don't want to believe me.

21:53.437 --> 21:54.521
Professor.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.691
<i>I know. It's been a long day, right?</i>

21:58.775 --> 22:00.027
<i>I'll leave you to rest.</i>

22:25.844 --> 22:28.513
Kang Yo-han isn't a threat to us anymore.

22:28.597 --> 22:30.766
It's time you lift the state of emergency

22:30.849 --> 22:32.309
and handle the public unrest--

22:32.392 --> 22:33.852
What are you talking about?

22:33.935 --> 22:35.896
Since we started it,
we should see an end to it!

22:35.979 --> 22:38.398
Let's include more regions
to our virus map,

22:38.482 --> 22:41.485
and increase the number of migrants.

22:41.568 --> 22:45.197
Mr. President, that's not quite
in line with our original plan.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.492
To start, the concentration camps
would not be able to handle…

22:48.575 --> 22:49.785
From now on!

22:56.374 --> 22:57.709
From now on…

22:59.294 --> 23:01.630
the stage is all mine.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.550
When I make a lonely decision
in the face of history,

23:05.634 --> 23:10.055
the rest of you simply need to
follow me, all right?

23:10.722 --> 23:11.556
And you!

23:11.640 --> 23:14.810
Honestly, since back in the days,

23:14.893 --> 23:18.897
why do you always have to get so cheeky?
You wench.

23:28.990 --> 23:30.450
First and foremost,

23:30.534 --> 23:34.496
we'll take this chance
to wipe them all out!

23:34.579 --> 23:37.833
Those old geezers and bums
who gnaw at our welfare budget

23:37.916 --> 23:42.629
when they contribute nothing
to our country!

23:42.712 --> 23:46.800
And not to mention the grumps
who are always protesting in groups!

23:46.883 --> 23:50.262
We should cleanse out
those scums from our society

23:50.345 --> 23:53.431
to build a new nation!

23:53.515 --> 23:56.351
A young and powerful nation!

23:56.434 --> 23:59.938
I've been proclaiming it
on my online channel, haven't I?

24:00.021 --> 24:02.357
Let's change Korea totally!

24:05.360 --> 24:08.780
This… this is a revolution!

24:08.864 --> 24:10.991
It's a revolution to restore order

24:11.074 --> 24:15.036
to our country, the Republic of Korea!
Do you get it?

24:18.540 --> 24:20.876
What an inspiring speech.

24:21.459 --> 24:25.005
But did you ever think
about the consequences?

24:27.007 --> 24:28.133
What consequences?

24:28.216 --> 24:30.635
The more you let things get out of hand,
the bigger the resistance.

24:30.719 --> 24:32.929
What will you do if the angry citizens

24:33.013 --> 24:35.557
take to the streets in protest?

24:35.640 --> 24:36.641
What else?

24:37.434 --> 24:41.521
I'm also the Commander-in-Chief.
I'll just wipe them clean!

24:41.605 --> 24:43.857
I'll deploy tanks in Gwanghwamun,

24:43.940 --> 24:46.902
and round up the airborne division too.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.445
I mean, why can't we?

24:48.528 --> 24:50.739
That's what they did
in the old days, wasn't it?

24:50.822 --> 24:52.908
Damn it…

25:03.001 --> 25:04.419
What the…

25:09.925 --> 25:10.759
What?

25:14.471 --> 25:15.472
Hold on.

25:16.473 --> 25:19.726
Hey! What was that just now?
Are you crazy?

25:19.809 --> 25:21.519
You crazy wench…

25:23.772 --> 25:24.940
Look at her!

25:26.399 --> 25:27.442
Oh what?

25:28.193 --> 25:30.695
You're in this too, are you?
What the hell is this?

25:32.864 --> 25:36.660
There's a limit to my patience,
you dumbfuck.

25:37.327 --> 25:40.622
You're just a clown
that I took as my puppet.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.998
Didn't you know?

25:42.082 --> 25:45.543
What? You think you've become
some great leader, do you?

25:49.172 --> 25:51.174
Hey! Secretary Kim!

25:51.258 --> 25:54.261
This is a coup! A coup d'etat!

25:55.470 --> 25:57.264
Hey! Secretary Kim!

25:59.140 --> 26:00.225
Listen to me carefully.

26:00.308 --> 26:02.435
I guess you don't know
what's going on here.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.604
But I'm not joking,
so you have to believe me.

26:04.688 --> 26:07.649
You have to believe me.
Go on and shoot them.

26:07.732 --> 26:10.902
You need to believe me. This is a coup
and I've just given you orders.

26:10.986 --> 26:11.987
Go on and shoot them.

26:12.070 --> 26:16.116
Now get a grip on yourself
and start with her first. Shoot her!

26:16.199 --> 26:17.409
Now!

26:21.246 --> 26:22.289
Chairwoman Jung.

26:26.626 --> 26:27.877
What?

26:44.853 --> 26:46.187
Don't scare us.

26:47.188 --> 26:48.773
It's okay, you may leave.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.526
Yes, ma'am.

26:56.239 --> 26:57.782
Hey! Secretary Kim!

27:06.374 --> 27:08.668
What are you doing? Get up!

27:10.920 --> 27:13.840
Now go stand next to that <i>taegukgi</i>,
so you're not in the way.

27:30.523 --> 27:33.818
Excuse me, Mr. President, Your Honor.

27:35.028 --> 27:37.197
This is all business!

27:37.280 --> 27:40.825
Revolutions don't bring in cash.
Neither does history!

27:40.909 --> 27:43.453
So why should the Foundation
back such a thing?

27:44.871 --> 27:46.373
What a total idiot.

27:57.425 --> 28:02.055
I'm sure you've already guessed by now
why I asked to see you in private.

28:02.138 --> 28:04.516
What else can it be

28:04.599 --> 28:07.060
other than to talk about
someone who's not here?

28:07.769 --> 28:10.605
Like our honorable
Mr. President, for example.

28:10.688 --> 28:13.775
So? What are your thoughts?

28:15.026 --> 28:16.820
He seems to be having a ball, I'd say.

28:17.695 --> 28:20.949
After being a supporting act all his life,
he finally has the stage all to himself.

28:21.032 --> 28:22.867
So I can understand.

28:24.285 --> 28:26.830
Though pushing his limits
will knock him down.

28:27.789 --> 28:31.459
I hear he ordered to kill Jukchang
if he ever opens his mouth to talk

28:31.543 --> 28:33.336
in front of the entire nation.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.214
I know, right?

28:36.297 --> 28:39.968
He never thinks about the consequences.
I say he's been watching too many movies.

28:40.051 --> 28:42.470
I asked him what he'll do
should the people rise against him,

28:42.554 --> 28:44.723
and he said he'll bulldoze them down!

28:44.806 --> 28:46.975
Every time he opens his mouth to talk,
it's all blackmail.

28:47.058 --> 28:50.478
This is a project to redevelop Seoul
and sell it to foreign capital.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.356
Honestly, that man knows
nothing about business.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.695
Do you want to hear
something more shocking?

28:59.863 --> 29:00.864
What?

29:01.906 --> 29:03.450
Our President…

29:04.159 --> 29:07.620
was seriously thinking of
leaking the virus in Seoul.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.584
What are we going to do with that moron?

29:12.667 --> 29:15.587
Is he crazy?
Who'd buy something that's contaminated?

29:17.338 --> 29:19.466
He lacks business sense

29:20.216 --> 29:21.676
because he's an artist.

29:22.594 --> 29:25.054
I'm not so sure about him anymore.

29:31.644 --> 29:34.439
We should think of a plan B.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.649
An elite who's not so volatile.

29:43.740 --> 29:46.201
The president and the chief justice too

29:46.284 --> 29:48.703
are all non-regular seats
filled at our discretion.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.623
Yet why do they always
let it get to their head?

29:51.706 --> 29:54.709
There are still
the unchanging protagonists,

29:54.793 --> 29:56.503
and why can't they see that?

30:15.522 --> 30:17.023
Oh, shut up!

31:08.449 --> 31:10.410
Now you look a little lonely.

31:14.789 --> 31:18.084
That's some courage
coming to see me at your own will.

31:18.877 --> 31:19.961
Why?

31:20.044 --> 31:22.714
You want to get revenge
for your friend's death?

31:22.797 --> 31:26.175
Come on. You're not that much of an idiot.

31:27.051 --> 31:30.889
What's happened has happened,
and there's nothing to gain from it.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.765
I know you're not irrational.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.906
Let me give you one last chance.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.166
I want to give you one last chance

32:01.586 --> 32:03.212
because you're my Young Master.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.515
On one condition. Don't get so cocky.

32:14.599 --> 32:17.268
I'm offering
a once-in-a-lifetime chance, you know.

32:17.852 --> 32:21.105
A chance to go to the Blue House
instead of to prison.

32:21.773 --> 32:22.899
Why?

32:24.025 --> 32:25.985
You need a new puppet, do you?

32:28.363 --> 32:30.239
Is Heo Joong-se not to your taste?

32:36.871 --> 32:39.290
You want to go to prison
for rigging trials then?

32:39.374 --> 32:43.461
Where those trashy bastards
that you put away are waiting for you?

32:44.128 --> 32:45.922
Can you honestly handle that?

32:49.425 --> 32:51.928
You're working so hard.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.099
I admire that about you.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.938
You're always squirming and struggling

33:03.439 --> 33:06.192
to satiate the thirst you cannot quench,

33:06.943 --> 33:09.821
and dare to own what you cannot have.

33:12.407 --> 33:13.658
You really are…

33:14.826 --> 33:16.536
a pathetic soul, aren't you?

35:50.106 --> 35:55.486
JUDGE KANG YO-HAN'S STATEMENT
ON ALLEGATIONS OF TRIAL RIGGING

35:55.570 --> 35:57.655
How will that bastard
try and con us this time?

36:29.061 --> 36:30.313
Fellow Koreans.

36:32.273 --> 36:33.649
I am a sinner.

36:34.817 --> 36:35.693
What?

36:36.360 --> 36:37.820
What's he playing at here?

36:42.700 --> 36:46.454
The allegations raised against me
are all true.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.834
I have betrayed your faith.

36:58.674 --> 37:02.053
I have been abusing the law
to punish the criminals.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.685
What I have come to painfully
realize as a judicial officer

37:11.687 --> 37:12.897
is that the law

37:15.399 --> 37:17.443
is silent in front of power.

37:18.819 --> 37:21.072
<i>After witnessing with my own eyes
how people with power and money</i>

37:21.155 --> 37:24.784
<i>escape through loopholes
despite the crimes they committed,</i>

37:26.661 --> 37:28.454
I wanted to use whatever means

37:29.163 --> 37:31.624
to make them pay the price.

37:36.003 --> 37:37.296
<i>That's right.</i>

37:40.508 --> 37:44.262
I had been using my fury against
this reality where justice does not stand

37:45.972 --> 37:47.640
to cross the line

37:50.351 --> 37:51.644
that must not be crossed.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.652
<i>My deepest apologies to you all.</i>

38:00.444 --> 38:03.572
I have no right to serve the law anymore.

38:04.699 --> 38:05.783
As of today,

38:06.575 --> 38:08.286
I will resign from my post

38:09.245 --> 38:11.872
and gladly receive any punishment
that is bestowed upon me.

38:15.251 --> 38:17.878
I am a sinner.

38:19.171 --> 38:21.382
So please hurl stones at me.

38:27.888 --> 38:29.765
<i>This way, Judge Kang!</i>

38:29.849 --> 38:32.310
Do you ever plan on returning?

38:40.526 --> 38:43.571
Judge Kang, no!

38:43.654 --> 38:45.031
Don't leave us, Judge Kang!

38:47.950 --> 38:49.535
Judge Kang, wait!

38:49.618 --> 38:51.120
Judge Kang!

38:56.375 --> 38:57.585
Thank you, Judge Oh.

38:57.668 --> 38:58.961
Judge Kang…

39:04.216 --> 39:07.678
-And you too, Director.
-No, Judge Kang.

39:07.762 --> 39:10.514
Judge Kang…

39:10.598 --> 39:12.475
Judge Kang, you did nothing wrong!

39:15.686 --> 39:18.272
Kang Yo-han for president!

39:18.356 --> 39:19.774
Kang Yo-han for president!

39:19.857 --> 39:25.196
-Kang Yo-han! Kang Yo-han!
-Kang Yo-han! Kang Yo-han!

39:25.279 --> 39:31.160
-Kang Yo-han! Kang Yo-han!
-Kang Yo-han! Kang Yo-han!

39:34.538 --> 39:37.166
<i>The public's support for
Judge Kang Yo-han remains strong.</i>

39:37.249 --> 39:41.670
<i>There have been movements across
the nation rallying in support of him. </i>

39:41.754 --> 39:43.130
What a scary bastard.

39:45.925 --> 39:47.051
Chairwoman Jung.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.346
What are we going to do about this?

39:51.847 --> 39:54.308
Isn't Mr. Heo Joong-se a lucky man?

39:55.393 --> 39:58.104
Looks like he'll be staying
at the Blue House for a little longer.

40:04.151 --> 40:05.319
<i>Yes, Seon-a.</i>

40:06.570 --> 40:08.447
Mark the Opposition.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.991
<i>Judge Kang Yo-han's apology
to the nation earlier today</i>

40:11.075 --> 40:14.078
<i>has resulted in a stronger support
nation-wide…</i>

40:14.161 --> 40:15.579
Thank you for your offer, Governor,

40:16.497 --> 40:18.666
but I think it's too early
for such discussions.

40:20.584 --> 40:21.961
I apologize.

40:33.639 --> 40:35.391
<i>A quick opinion poll showed that</i>

40:35.474 --> 40:37.351
<i>as much as 57.6% of the respondents</i>

40:37.435 --> 40:41.772
<i>are willing to support Judge Kang Yo-han
should he run for presidency.</i>

40:41.856 --> 40:44.692
<i>This has sparked a competition
among the opposition parties,</i>

40:44.775 --> 40:48.070
<i>who had no strong candidates
for the presidency to recruit Judge Kang.</i>

40:48.154 --> 40:52.158
<i>Many eyes are now on
Judge Kang Yo-han's next steps.</i>

41:19.393 --> 41:20.227
Ga-on…

41:29.904 --> 41:33.157
This is Su-hyeon's keepsake.

41:36.494 --> 41:37.786
POLICE POCKETBOOK

41:55.221 --> 41:57.640
Right until her death,

41:57.723 --> 42:00.267
Su-hyeon had been digging
into the cathedral fire.

42:01.060 --> 42:03.854
I'm sure she'd come to see you
to tell you something that day.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.946
INSPECTOR YOON SU-HYUN

42:13.948 --> 42:15.741
POLICE POCKETBOOK

42:16.325 --> 42:19.703
Yes, that detective lady
was quite determined.

42:19.787 --> 42:22.540
I don't know how many times
she's visited this neighborhood!

42:22.623 --> 42:24.333
When was her last visit?

42:25.084 --> 42:26.710
Not so long ago, I believe.

42:26.794 --> 42:28.837
Was it a fortnight ago?

42:29.505 --> 42:32.508
She said she managed to
track everyone down

42:32.591 --> 42:36.679
except for this Jung Joseph who used to
work odd jobs at the cathedral.

42:36.762 --> 42:38.013
Is this him?

42:39.682 --> 42:41.600
Yes, that's Joseph all right.

42:44.061 --> 42:45.854
After she visited,

42:45.938 --> 42:50.359
someone told me that
they'd seen Joseph in Seoul.

42:51.193 --> 42:52.361
And, ma'am?

42:52.444 --> 42:55.239
So I called that detective lady
and let her know.

42:56.490 --> 42:57.658
Is that the…

43:00.828 --> 43:04.248
"Old house, blue gate,
end of the street," right here?

43:05.749 --> 43:08.377
Yes, that's it! That's what I'd told her.

43:09.003 --> 43:11.171
-May I have the name of his neighborhood?
-Sure.

43:11.255 --> 43:13.424
I'm sure I've written it down somewhere.

43:15.426 --> 43:19.680
So did something happen
to that detective lady?

43:23.851 --> 43:26.353
No. I just wanted to check something.

43:57.676 --> 43:58.802
Is anyone home?

44:01.388 --> 44:02.556
Hello.

44:13.525 --> 44:14.652
Mr. Jung Joseph!

44:17.279 --> 44:18.238
Is anyone home?

44:27.539 --> 44:28.874
Mr. Jung Joseph!

44:46.350 --> 44:47.601
Is anyone there?

44:47.685 --> 44:49.603
Then have you ever seen this man in your--

44:49.687 --> 44:53.065
No! Don't you know
we're in a state of emergency?

45:06.453 --> 45:07.788
Is anyone there?

45:10.207 --> 45:11.792
Is anyone home?

45:20.217 --> 45:22.344
Who are you?

45:26.056 --> 45:28.016
You're Mr. Jung Joseph, aren't you?

45:29.309 --> 45:31.353
You're that judge who works with Judge…

45:31.437 --> 45:32.688
Yes, I'm…

45:33.605 --> 45:35.107
Mr. Jung!

45:35.190 --> 45:36.483
Wait. Mr. Jung!

45:40.904 --> 45:42.448
Mr. Jung!

45:42.531 --> 45:44.741
Please don't kill me.
Please let me go, please!

45:45.325 --> 45:47.161
Why are you doing this? Get up.

45:47.744 --> 45:51.874
Judge Kang sent you to kill me, didn't he?

45:55.419 --> 45:57.671
Can I really trust you?

45:59.214 --> 46:02.801
If I was here under Judge Kang's orders,
why would I be doing this now?

46:02.885 --> 46:06.180
If you still feel anxious,
let me find you a place to stay tonight.

46:06.263 --> 46:08.098
I'm sure Justice Min Jeong-ho will help.

46:10.017 --> 46:14.354
-Do you really promise to hide me?
-Yes.

46:14.438 --> 46:17.733
If you want, I'll have
Justice Min Jeong-ho call you.

46:24.865 --> 46:28.118
There is footage that was recorded

46:28.827 --> 46:30.120
at the time of the fire.

46:31.497 --> 46:33.081
I had been in charge of maintaining it.

46:34.166 --> 46:35.959
Not so long after that fire,

46:36.919 --> 46:38.921
Judge Kang Yo-han had come to see me.

46:39.588 --> 46:43.133
He told me to hand over that recording
and to keep it a secret forever.

46:43.217 --> 46:44.927
In return, he promised me a new house

46:45.886 --> 46:48.305
and enough money for me
to get by in return.

46:48.388 --> 46:50.015
So that's what I did.

46:50.098 --> 46:51.183
But…

46:53.060 --> 46:54.394
I'm ashamed to say this,

46:55.062 --> 46:58.482
but I had created a copy

46:58.565 --> 47:00.943
in case I needed cash.

47:01.026 --> 47:03.237
Then a few months ago,

47:04.279 --> 47:06.573
Judge Kang Yo-han sent someone
who came to see me.

47:07.366 --> 47:09.409
They started to torture me

47:09.493 --> 47:11.620
asking whether I'd created a copy.

47:11.703 --> 47:13.747
I honestly thought I'd die,

47:14.414 --> 47:17.167
so I confessed the truth
and handed it over.

47:22.256 --> 47:24.925
Then what about these injuries?

47:26.385 --> 47:30.681
A few days ago,
a detective had come to see me.

47:34.142 --> 47:35.227
<i>Is anyone home?</i>

47:36.979 --> 47:38.188
Who…

47:40.315 --> 47:41.400
Mr. Jung Joseph?

47:43.235 --> 47:45.320
Wait!

47:46.321 --> 47:47.823
I'm Yoon Su-hyeon from the WAIS.

47:49.241 --> 47:50.701
<i>I told her I know nothing</i>

47:50.784 --> 47:52.869
<i>and told her to bring a warrant
if there's a problem.</i>

47:52.953 --> 47:55.080
But just when I'd managed
to turn her away,

47:55.163 --> 47:57.583
another of Judge Kang's henchmen
came to see me.

47:57.666 --> 48:01.670
He asked me if I had told her anything
or handed another copy to her.

48:01.753 --> 48:03.213
Then he did this to me…

48:10.887 --> 48:13.140
About this person who came to see you.

48:13.223 --> 48:15.976
Do you have his phone number or anything
that I can track him down with?

48:16.059 --> 48:17.144
No.

48:17.936 --> 48:19.688
He only came to see me in person, so…

48:21.440 --> 48:24.234
Oh! He'd parked his car

48:24.318 --> 48:25.819
right in front of my place.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.831
-Here you go.
-Thank you so much.

48:37.914 --> 48:38.874
Thank you so much.

48:38.957 --> 48:41.668
Don't mention it.
You can take your time with it.

49:01.855 --> 49:04.191
That's him. This is his car.

49:04.274 --> 49:05.400
-This car?
-Yes.

49:11.948 --> 49:14.951
<i>We need to catch Kang's henchmen
no matter what.</i>

49:15.035 --> 49:16.745
<i>If he really is the one
that killed Su-hyeon,</i>

49:16.828 --> 49:19.790
Judge Kang may kill him next
to try and eliminate evidence.

49:20.457 --> 49:23.919
Then do you think you can run
his plate number right now?

49:24.002 --> 49:26.546
<i>Yes, one of my old students
is at the Police Agency.</i>

49:26.630 --> 49:28.548
I'll call you back
once I get the information.

49:28.632 --> 49:29.883
Thank you.

49:40.435 --> 49:43.230
What was in that recording, anyway?

49:45.023 --> 49:46.775
That's something I cannot tell you.

49:46.858 --> 49:48.610
Please don't ask me about it.

49:48.694 --> 49:51.988
Judge Kang said
he'll chase me down to hell to kill me

49:52.072 --> 49:54.866
if I ever let it slip.

49:54.950 --> 49:57.577
And he's more than capable of doing so.

50:00.122 --> 50:02.582
Just wait. Just wait a little more.

50:02.666 --> 50:05.919
I'll expose Kang Yo-han's true face.
I'm almost there, Ga-on.

50:17.723 --> 50:19.558
<i>You have arrived at your destination.</i>

50:21.309 --> 50:23.395
261S3820

51:05.729 --> 51:06.980
Who's there?

52:02.452 --> 52:05.914
RECENT CALLS: YH

52:30.355 --> 52:31.481
<i>Hello?</i>

52:33.984 --> 52:35.151
<i>Hello?</i>

53:20.739 --> 53:22.824
<i>Who was it that shot Su-hyeon?</i>

53:24.659 --> 53:26.453
She wasn't their target.

53:27.287 --> 53:30.624
They were trying to eliminate us
amidst the chaos.

53:33.335 --> 53:35.170
If you want to save the world,

53:35.253 --> 53:38.840
cut off Yoon Su-hyeon from your life.

53:42.093 --> 53:45.555
You can't choose to be with her
if you're going to help me.

54:08.036 --> 54:09.204
<i>It must be hell.</i>

54:12.207 --> 54:14.751
<i>A hell you can never escape from.</i>

54:16.378 --> 54:20.256
Make those bastards
who did this burn in hell.

54:21.800 --> 54:24.594
That's the only way to survive it.

55:44.215 --> 55:45.884
Are you sure you won't regret this?

55:49.471 --> 55:52.599
I'm willing to die if you wish.

55:55.518 --> 55:57.020
But you'll regret it.

55:58.104 --> 55:59.314
For life.

56:23.338 --> 56:25.090
But you killed Su-hyeon.

56:30.678 --> 56:32.013
Ga-on.

56:33.306 --> 56:34.682
I know you're in pain.

56:35.350 --> 56:38.311
You're in so much pain that
you just want to blame someone.

56:39.062 --> 56:40.271
Shut up!

56:43.274 --> 56:44.651
I saw it with my own eyes.

56:45.527 --> 56:47.529
The proof that you're the culprit!

56:47.612 --> 56:49.697
I don't know what it is that you saw,

56:50.448 --> 56:52.283
but you'll realize it soon enough.

56:52.951 --> 56:54.869
How futile evidence is

56:54.953 --> 56:56.913
and how easily humans are deceived!

56:58.748 --> 57:00.625
It was you who killed your brother.

57:01.251 --> 57:02.168
What?

57:02.252 --> 57:04.921
What was in that recording
you seized from Joseph?

57:06.589 --> 57:09.759
You, setting fire to the cathedral?

57:37.495 --> 57:38.788
Did you meet Joseph?

57:43.084 --> 57:44.836
Did you?

57:47.547 --> 57:48.631
Stand back!

58:04.022 --> 58:06.316
Get away from Ga-on, right now!

58:16.075 --> 58:17.160
Mr. Kang Yo-han.

58:17.243 --> 58:20.705
You're under arrest for abetting
the murder of Inspector Yoon Su-hyeon.

58:20.788 --> 58:24.042
You have the right to an attorney,
the right to explain your actions,

58:24.125 --> 58:26.336
and the right to appeal to Court.

58:31.049 --> 58:33.092
Is that what you think of me?

58:33.176 --> 58:36.012
That I killed my own brother,
killed Yoon Su-hyeon,

58:36.095 --> 58:37.680
and used you too?

58:42.060 --> 58:45.355
That all that I'd told you were all lies?

58:51.319 --> 58:52.612
Ga-on…

59:16.094 --> 59:19.305
Wow, so tear-jerking.

59:20.473 --> 59:21.474
You…

59:21.975 --> 59:24.394
I've never seen you
with those eyes, Young Master.

59:25.061 --> 59:27.021
Why are you here and how…

59:29.107 --> 59:30.817
It's good to see you, Chairwoman.

59:39.576 --> 59:40.868
Professor.

59:44.080 --> 59:45.206
Don't tell me…

59:46.749 --> 59:50.003
There is no such thing
as overlapping coincidences.

59:51.087 --> 59:53.715
Yes, it's a coincidence that
you're just like Kang Yi-sak,

59:53.798 --> 59:56.217
but for you to work with Kang Yo-han?

59:57.802 --> 59:59.512
No, that can't be a coincidence.

1:00:00.305 --> 1:00:02.181
How dare you…

1:00:08.938 --> 1:00:10.773
<i>I, Kim Ga-on,</i>

1:00:10.857 --> 1:00:14.736
do solemnly swear
that I will administer justice

1:00:14.819 --> 1:00:20.783
with a clear conscience and in conformity
with the Constitution and other acts,

1:00:20.867 --> 1:00:23.036
and impartially discharge
and perform all duties

1:00:23.119 --> 1:00:28.583
incumbent upon me
to serve the people of Korea.

1:00:42.597 --> 1:00:44.599
He looks just like him.

1:00:45.433 --> 1:00:47.769
One, two, three!

1:00:49.771 --> 1:00:51.481
-Please.
-Hurry up.

1:00:52.649 --> 1:00:54.525
Come in closer.

1:00:54.609 --> 1:00:56.319
You two take one together without me.

1:00:56.402 --> 1:00:57.695
-Count me out.
-No.

1:00:57.779 --> 1:00:59.405
-Oh, come on.
-One more now.

1:00:59.489 --> 1:01:01.449
Please smile for this one.

1:01:01.532 --> 1:01:04.619
One, two, three!

1:01:16.297 --> 1:01:19.884
Who do you think it was that appointed
Judge Min to the Supreme Court?

1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:31.521
Professor.

1:01:32.105 --> 1:01:34.399
It was a decision for the greater good.

1:01:40.988 --> 1:01:42.782
You will understand me someday.

1:01:54.627 --> 1:01:55.586
Ga-on.

1:01:57.797 --> 1:01:59.048
Professor.

1:01:59.132 --> 1:02:00.341
Wait. Professor!

1:02:04.303 --> 1:02:07.306
You're the weakness
I planted into Young Master.

1:02:10.393 --> 1:02:11.644
Because…

1:02:14.105 --> 1:02:15.857
this man is awfully dangerous.

1:02:22.905 --> 1:02:26.617
I told you I'd make you lonely.
Didn't I, Young Master?

1:02:47.847 --> 1:02:49.265
It was all manipulated.

1:02:49.849 --> 1:02:51.309
All manipulated!

1:02:52.185 --> 1:02:54.395
It wasn't Kang Yo-han.

1:02:55.271 --> 1:02:56.731
It was her doing!

1:02:56.814 --> 1:02:57.857
It's no use.

1:02:58.983 --> 1:03:01.068
They are all bribed by this woman.

1:03:20.755 --> 1:03:22.173
It was you all along then?

1:03:26.135 --> 1:03:29.138
It was you who told that old lady
about Jung Joseph's whereabouts,

1:03:31.182 --> 1:03:33.476
and you who forced Jung Joseph to lie?

1:03:34.727 --> 1:03:36.062
That's not it.

1:03:37.271 --> 1:03:39.273
What Joseph said is all true.

1:03:42.652 --> 1:03:45.071
Young Master was
desperate to hide the truth.

1:03:45.154 --> 1:03:47.406
It's just that the man who tortured Joseph

1:03:47.490 --> 1:03:51.661
to take the footage from him
wasn't one of Young Master's men.

1:03:52.453 --> 1:03:54.455
In fact, he was someone I'd sent.

1:03:57.124 --> 1:03:59.168
Me. Jung Seon-a.

1:03:59.669 --> 1:04:02.046
Damn it.

1:04:11.222 --> 1:04:12.223
No.

1:04:13.891 --> 1:04:15.142
No!

1:04:15.226 --> 1:04:18.271
This is what the Young Master
tried desperately to hide.

1:04:18.354 --> 1:04:19.939
No!

1:04:22.942 --> 1:04:24.110
No, don't!

1:04:24.193 --> 1:04:25.653
No!

1:04:26.279 --> 1:04:27.822
Get off me!

1:04:34.287 --> 1:04:36.914
Don't!

1:06:07.713 --> 1:06:10.800
ST. VERENA'S CHATEDRAL

1:06:10.883 --> 1:06:12.301
Corpus Christi.

1:06:13.678 --> 1:06:14.679
Corpus Christi.

1:06:14.762 --> 1:06:15.972
Is Elijah here?

1:06:16.847 --> 1:06:18.599
I'm sure she's outside. Don't worry.

1:06:19.266 --> 1:06:20.851
Corpus Christi.

1:06:21.519 --> 1:06:23.229
Teddy, pray with me.

1:06:24.563 --> 1:06:25.856
Bring your hands together,

1:06:26.440 --> 1:06:29.235
bow your head, and close your eyes.

1:06:31.112 --> 1:06:34.615
Please make Mom, Dad and Elijah happy.

1:06:36.701 --> 1:06:39.704
Teddy, what did you wish for?

1:06:41.163 --> 1:06:43.207
Teddy, are you cold?

1:06:43.290 --> 1:06:45.167
I'll warm you up.

1:06:53.050 --> 1:06:54.468
It's hot!

1:07:00.141 --> 1:07:02.268
Good boy, Teddy.

1:07:04.645 --> 1:07:05.855
Now let's go.

1:07:14.530 --> 1:07:15.948
Corpus Christi.

1:07:18.451 --> 1:07:19.702
Corpus Christi.

1:07:22.204 --> 1:07:23.664
Corpus Christi.

1:08:21.222 --> 1:08:23.933
What a poor soul Young Master is.

1:08:25.184 --> 1:08:28.938
In case that child will find out
she was her parents' killer,

1:08:30.231 --> 1:08:32.900
he tried to hide it all his life.

1:08:51.585 --> 1:08:52.628
Ga-on?

1:08:54.421 --> 1:08:55.422
Elijah…

1:08:55.506 --> 1:08:58.884
Elijah. Elijah!

1:08:59.969 --> 1:09:02.847
-Elijah!
-Yo-han!

1:09:03.764 --> 1:09:04.765
Elijah.

1:09:06.142 --> 1:09:07.476
Yo-han.

1:09:07.560 --> 1:09:08.853
Elijah!

1:09:09.436 --> 1:09:10.479
Elijah!

1:09:11.105 --> 1:09:12.189
Yo-han!

1:09:16.735 --> 1:09:18.571
Yo-han! Let go of me!

1:09:18.654 --> 1:09:20.156
Elijah!

1:09:20.239 --> 1:09:22.324
Let go of me!

1:09:23.325 --> 1:09:25.411
-Yo-han!
-Elijah!

1:09:25.494 --> 1:09:28.622
-Let go of me!
-Now it's time for Miss Elijah

1:09:29.415 --> 1:09:30.749
to learn the truth too.

1:09:32.251 --> 1:09:35.004
Please. Don't tell her.

1:09:35.087 --> 1:09:37.131
-Let go of me!
-Please don't tell Elijah.

1:09:38.340 --> 1:09:39.341
Elijah…

1:09:43.888 --> 1:09:45.472
Don't tell her.

1:09:47.016 --> 1:09:49.518
Please… Please!

1:09:49.602 --> 1:09:50.603
Yo-han!

1:09:51.353 --> 1:09:53.939
Get off me! Yo-han!

1:09:54.023 --> 1:09:55.191
Please…

1:09:55.274 --> 1:09:56.942
Yo-han!

1:09:59.153 --> 1:10:00.779
All I ever wanted

1:10:04.325 --> 1:10:07.703
was for you to look at me with those eyes.

1:10:16.837 --> 1:10:17.922
Please…

1:10:20.549 --> 1:10:21.967
Take him away.

1:11:01.215 --> 1:11:02.174
Yo-han…

1:11:21.485 --> 1:11:22.861
<i>That was the moment</i>

1:11:28.742 --> 1:11:30.494
<i>I made up my mind to die.</i>

1:12:18.125 --> 1:12:22.796
