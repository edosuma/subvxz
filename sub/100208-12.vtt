Hi, Josh.

00:04.961 --> 00:08.704
Uh, I know that my father is in prison

00:08.747 --> 00:10.749
for murdering your sister,

00:10.793 --> 00:13.926
but I wanted to talk to you
about your mother

00:13.970 --> 00:17.234
and ask whether or not
she may have had

00:17.278 --> 00:19.976
homicidal feelings towards Lucy.

00:20.020 --> 00:20.933

Ah!

00:20.977 --> 00:21.934
Oh, my God.

00:21.978 --> 00:24.111
...killed by her mom?
Sorry.

00:24.154 --> 00:27.157
Bess, what are you doing here?

00:27.201 --> 00:29.159
I still have a key
from when I stayed over.

00:29.203 --> 00:32.554
Okay, but the question
still stands.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.252
Okay?

00:35.296 --> 00:36.558
Um, Aunt Diana...

00:36.601 --> 00:38.386
Aunt Diana Marvin...

00:38.429 --> 00:40.953
is sending me on a critically
important lunch meeting,

00:40.997 --> 00:42.303
and I am tired

00:42.346 --> 00:44.174
of everything I own.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.697
So you came to raid my closet?

00:45.741 --> 00:48.700
Yeah, but my expectations
are low, so...

00:48.744 --> 00:51.094
What's this about
Lucy Sable's mom? Turns out

00:51.138 --> 00:52.095
Lucy was afraid of her.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.054
And how do you know that?

00:54.097 --> 00:55.403
Because she talked to her

00:55.446 --> 00:57.970
high school guidance
counselor about it.

00:58.014 --> 01:00.843
And her guidance counselor
was my mom.

01:00.886 --> 01:03.715
Oh.
I know.

01:03.759 --> 01:05.195
I saw the transcript myself.

01:05.239 --> 01:09.286
Lucy said that her mom was
going to kill her

01:09.330 --> 01:11.114
because of the rumors
the Hudsons were spreading.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.420
Okay, whoa.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.813
This is getting incestuous.

01:14.857 --> 01:17.077
Do you really think
Lucy Sable's mom would do that?

01:17.120 --> 01:20.297
No. I'm betting
Lucy meant it metaphorically.

01:20.341 --> 01:25.085
But it shows me that
her mom knows something.

01:25.128 --> 01:27.087
And I am willing
to chase any lead

01:27.130 --> 01:28.436
that could prove
my dad is innocent.

01:28.479 --> 01:30.829
So...
Yeah.

01:37.532 --> 01:40.230

01:40.274 --> 01:41.449
And for what it's worth,

01:41.492 --> 01:42.319
I don't think Carson
murdered my sister.

01:42.363 --> 01:44.452
Lucy loved her talks with Kate.

01:44.495 --> 01:47.411
And she always said your dad
was really decent to her.

01:47.455 --> 01:50.022
Then help me prove
his innocence.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.112
If I could just talk
to your mom, then...

01:52.155 --> 01:55.158

unless they're family.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.208
What if I said that I thought

02:01.251 --> 02:03.688
that she might hold the clue
to finding Lucy's killer?

02:06.474 --> 02:09.041
I appreciate the effort. Really.

02:09.085 --> 02:11.174

hoping for justice.

02:11.218 --> 02:12.741

02:12.784 --> 02:14.221
I get that.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.962
I do. But I found some
new information about Lucy...

02:17.006 --> 02:19.008
My mom had a stroke
after Lucy died.

02:19.051 --> 02:20.531
She hasn't been the same since.

02:20.575 --> 02:23.578
I doubt she'd be able
to tell you much about anything.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.276
I'm sorry.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.365
It's okay.

So...

02:34.589 --> 02:38.419

with this Amaya Alston?

that... it sounds simple.

02:42.945 --> 02:46.383

want me to just make friends.

02:46.427 --> 02:47.776
Really? Yeah.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.081
What does Lisbeth think
about that?

02:49.125 --> 02:50.257
No, it's not romantic.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.346
That's not what I meant.
Diana wants Amaya

02:52.389 --> 02:54.565

02:54.609 --> 02:56.698
And yes, Lisbeth knows about it.

Oh. Nice.

investment strategies.

03:04.140 --> 03:06.490

a good impression

03:06.534 --> 03:09.232

that could open the doors

can work together.

03:12.409 --> 03:13.367

Ah.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.589
And what if I make an impression
that is mediocre, hmm?

03:18.633 --> 03:20.678
Who wants to mentor someone
who is mediocre?

03:20.722 --> 03:23.290
Bess, you are well above mediocre.

You have to say that;
you're my platanchor.

03:25.205 --> 03:27.946

my... contractual obligation

03:27.990 --> 03:29.992

10:18.748 --> 10:20.532
What? So-so, what...
I mean, your lawyer needs

10:20.576 --> 10:21.795
to get you out of there.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.232
No. I tried her already.
Radio silence.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.451
For all I know,
Everett threatened her.

10:26.495 --> 10:28.279
The Hudsons can reach anyone:

10:28.323 --> 10:30.455
inmates, attorneys, COs.

10:30.499 --> 10:31.674
That's why I need Nancy.

10:31.718 --> 10:33.676
She can find out who to trust.

10:33.720 --> 10:34.677
What about Chief McGinnis?

10:34.721 --> 10:36.723
No. Ace.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.681
They're not gonna
let me make another phone call.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.727
You're it. Okay?

10:42.119 --> 10:43.860
You got to get ahold of Nancy.

10:43.904 --> 10:45.340
I got to go.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.168
All right, just hang tight,
all right?

10:48.735 --> 10:50.911
Nancy, I know you're
in the middle of a thing,

10:50.954 --> 10:53.304
but I really need you
to call me back.

10:53.348 --> 10:56.351
But, uh, thing is that
your dad is in trouble

10:56.394 --> 10:57.831
and there's no time to wait.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.921
I'm sure, you know,
it's gonna be okay.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.574
Unless it isn't.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.621
But, uh... But it is.
It's gonna be, uh, good.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.623
Just call me, call me back
whenever you get a chance.

11:15.979 --> 11:18.765
[engine starts]

11:28.862 --> 11:30.864
Damn it.

11:38.262 --> 11:39.481
[beeps, clicks]

11:41.483 --> 11:42.614
[whispers]:
Now.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.660
You owe me, Drew.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.358
ORDERLY:
Excuse me.
Where's your badge?

11:47.402 --> 11:49.056
You're not supposed
to be in here.

11:51.014 --> 11:53.016
We got a runner.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.898
[muttering softly]

12:04.941 --> 12:07.509
[door closes]

12:14.168 --> 12:15.386
[exhales sharply]

12:25.092 --> 12:26.963
MAN [over radio]:
In pursuit now.

12:27.007 --> 12:29.313
There may be more on the loose.
Keep checking.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.905
"Temporarily relocated
out of the East Wing.

12:55.949 --> 13:00.780
Low-sodium vegetarian diet,
need help walking..."

13:26.893 --> 13:28.851
ORDERLY 2:
Hey.

13:28.895 --> 13:32.724
Where's your visitor's badge?
You're not supposed to be here.

13:32.768 --> 13:33.987
Hi. Sorry.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.989
Uh, I-I must've dropped it.

13:36.032 --> 13:40.210
Uh, I'm actually here
to visit my aunt's room...

13:40.254 --> 13:41.429
Hey, it's Sal.

13:41.472 --> 13:43.866
I found the runner.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.346
[exhales]

13:50.612 --> 13:52.396
I'm not a runaway visitor.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.398
I-I just think I dropped
my badge somewhere.

13:54.442 --> 13:57.662
Well, we're being
extra vigilant these days.

13:57.706 --> 13:59.839
Because of what's been going on?

14:01.536 --> 14:04.495
I can tell you-you really
care about this place.

14:06.323 --> 14:08.760
Y-You care about safety.

14:08.804 --> 14:11.894
Well, so do I.

14:11.938 --> 14:14.027
That's actually why I'm here.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.464
Who are you, really?

14:16.507 --> 14:19.771
I am from
The Horseshoe Bay Ledger.

14:19.815 --> 14:22.731
I'm writing a story about
what's happening here.

14:24.820 --> 14:27.779
You're here about the haunting?

14:27.823 --> 14:30.304
Yes.

14:30.347 --> 14:31.827
[laughs softly]

14:31.871 --> 14:33.960
I've been trying
to tell people for weeks.

14:34.003 --> 14:35.352
No one wants to talk about it.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.311
I want to talk about it,
for my story.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.748
And you can remain
totally anonymous,

14:39.791 --> 14:43.883
I just need you to
tell me everything.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.885
All right.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.586
Uh, excuse me, sir.

14:51.629 --> 14:52.543
Do you have a reservation?

14:52.587 --> 14:54.284
I have many, but
I'm here anyways

14:54.328 --> 14:57.070
because I saw Ryan Hudson's
car parked out front.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.115
Ah. There he is. Thank you.

15:03.728 --> 15:06.731
I need to talk to you.
It's urgent. Very important.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.733
Will you excuse me
for a minute, please?

15:08.777 --> 15:10.692
Thank you.

15:15.566 --> 15:17.046
Did your dad

15:17.090 --> 15:19.570
order a jailhouse hit
on Carson Drew?

15:22.922 --> 15:25.489
My father wouldn't
do anything like that.

15:25.533 --> 15:27.622
Your dad sank his own ship
and killed the entire crew.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.973
More recently, he had me and
my girlfriend run off the road.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.453
Carson represented you.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.063
He had your back

15:34.107 --> 15:36.457
after your wife died,
when nobody else would.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.762
Call off the hit.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.593
[clears throat]

15:44.682 --> 15:47.947
If Carson Drew is being targeted,

15:47.990 --> 15:50.906
the only way you're gonna
save his life

15:50.950 --> 15:52.952
is by getting him out of jail.

15:57.521 --> 15:58.522
[clears throat]

16:01.134 --> 16:03.092
I need you to talk to Ryan.
[whispers]: What are you doing?

16:03.136 --> 16:05.486
She's great, isn't she?
Check your texts.

16:06.487 --> 16:08.010
[chuckles]

16:08.054 --> 16:10.317
SAL:
The renovation is a total cover-up.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.449
The haunting began
three weeks ago.

16:12.493 --> 16:16.018
We-we had a supernatural attack
by mold and insects.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.194
What happened?

16:18.238 --> 16:21.328
Well, it started with this
ice-cold wind that kept blowing

16:21.371 --> 16:23.199
through the rooms
of the East Wing.

16:23.243 --> 16:24.722
Then the roaches came.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.463
We called in exterminators,

16:26.507 --> 16:28.291
but no matter what,
the bugs came back.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.424
After that, the mold started.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.730
That's when we moved everyone
out and called in a priest.

16:32.774 --> 16:36.908
He blessed the East Wing
and sealed the doors.

16:38.736 --> 16:41.478
These problems in the East Wing,

16:41.522 --> 16:45.874
did they happen to start after
the night of September 10?

16:45.917 --> 16:47.136
You did your homework.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.964
I got a report

16:49.008 --> 16:52.228
at the Ledger about some kids
who conducted a séance

16:52.272 --> 16:56.493
and may have unleashed
a dark spirit or two.

16:56.537 --> 17:00.062
Hey, did they move
the cafeteria?

17:00.106 --> 17:02.586
Let me guess.
Lactose intolerant?

17:02.630 --> 17:03.848
No, vegetarian.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.589
That's a weird guessing game.

17:05.633 --> 17:08.375
I pride myself on knowing every
patient's dietary restrictions

17:08.418 --> 17:10.159
without having to look
at their door labels.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.511
So which one means vegetarian?

17:14.555 --> 17:17.471
Green apple.
Cryptic, right?

17:17.514 --> 17:20.735
Come on, buddy. Let's
get you to the cafeteria.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.002
Okay, green apple
means vegetarian.

17:27.046 --> 17:31.702
Now, which one means low-sodium?

17:31.746 --> 17:33.269
When the 18th comes around,

17:33.313 --> 17:35.445
those put options will
be so far in the money

17:35.489 --> 17:37.056
you'll get your face ripped off.

17:40.581 --> 17:41.843
Gentlemen...

17:43.192 --> 17:44.498
...do we have a deal?

17:44.541 --> 17:45.542
I believe we do.

17:49.677 --> 17:51.026
Pleasure. Thank you.

17:53.420 --> 17:54.638
[sighs]

17:54.682 --> 17:57.119
Nice meeting you.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.643
Wait, that's it?

17:59.687 --> 18:03.778
Unless you want me to dumb down
the epic deal I just negotiated.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.780
I don't need you to bitchsplain
the stock market to me.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.303
[phone buzzing]

18:08.739 --> 18:10.654
Wha...
[gasps]

18:10.698 --> 18:12.482
Is this from that tall jar
of mayonnaise

18:12.526 --> 18:14.789
that has a mad-on
for Ryan Hudson?

18:14.832 --> 18:17.008
Look, the Hudsons have
killed before, okay?

18:17.052 --> 18:18.271
Ryan is the only one

18:18.314 --> 18:20.838
that can stop it
from happening again.

18:21.752 --> 18:24.755
Bess Marvin.

18:24.799 --> 18:27.802
You might be more interesting
than I thought.

18:30.848 --> 18:32.894
Mentoring moment. Come on.

18:32.937 --> 18:35.375
Hey. You...

18:40.815 --> 18:42.686
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

18:59.181 --> 19:01.444
GUARD:
Hold the line.

19:01.488 --> 19:04.012
Carson Drew. What is it?

19:04.055 --> 19:06.493
You're being transferred
to State.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.936
[buzzing]

19:27.905 --> 19:29.733
Sign here, please.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.692
ACE:
You got it.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.781
What are you do...
Shut up!

19:34.912 --> 19:37.176
We gonna have a problem?

19:37.219 --> 19:39.743
Can't stand
the chatty ones, man.

19:41.745 --> 19:43.660
I said get Nancy.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.096
Don't worry about it.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.663
I got a plan, Mr. D.

19:46.707 --> 19:49.144
[engine starts]

19:59.023 --> 20:00.764
Let me get this straight...

20:00.808 --> 20:02.462
Let's not say it out loud.

20:02.505 --> 20:06.205
You hacked into the Department
of Corrections database,

20:06.248 --> 20:09.164
ordered my official transfer
to the state prison,

20:09.208 --> 20:12.385
impersonated an officer
of the law, stole a van...

20:12.428 --> 20:14.300
Changed lanes without signaling.
That one just happened just now.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.780
And broke me out of prison.

20:16.824 --> 20:19.261
I am a prison escapee right now.

20:19.305 --> 20:22.221
Technically, yes.
But if we reframe it...

20:22.264 --> 20:23.918
No, no, no.
This doesn't get reframed.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.833
You need to take me back to jail

20:25.876 --> 20:27.400
before they realize
you took me, Ace.

20:27.443 --> 20:28.966
Yeah, I'm not gonna
do that, sir.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.577
What do you think
is gonna happen

20:30.620 --> 20:32.318
when I don't show up
at the state prison?

20:32.361 --> 20:33.754
There will probably

20:33.797 --> 20:35.756
be some confusion.
Yes.

20:35.799 --> 20:36.974
There probably will be.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.498
But if I bring you back,
you'll be killed.

20:38.541 --> 20:41.414
For Nancy's sake, and for yours,
I can't let that happen.

20:41.457 --> 20:44.939
So, all due respect, Mr. D,
I'm not turning around.

20:44.982 --> 20:46.984
[sighs]

20:52.294 --> 20:54.818
So what's this plan
that you have?

20:54.862 --> 20:58.039
Step one was get you
out of immediate danger.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.824
Step two is get
you someplace safe.

21:00.868 --> 21:03.958
Step three is to get proof
that your life is in danger,

21:04.001 --> 21:05.742
then we can ask a judge
to do something about it.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.447
This is Route 1.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.232
Please tell me
you're not just taking me

21:17.276 --> 21:19.103
to my house.

21:19.147 --> 21:22.498
Where would you like to pretend
that I'm taking you?

21:30.811 --> 21:31.855
Psst.

21:33.857 --> 21:36.077
Hi.
[exhales]: Hi.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.948
Ah, impressive.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.472
Yeah.

21:39.515 --> 21:42.126
So, we wait in here
till we meet Nancy

21:42.170 --> 21:44.955
in the East Wing
in seven minutes.

21:44.999 --> 21:47.001
So, what do we do
for seven minutes?

21:48.611 --> 21:52.354
I actually have some ideas
on restaurant management.

21:52.398 --> 21:55.966
Mm. So proactive.

22:00.188 --> 22:02.669
Your axe is huge, dude.

22:02.712 --> 22:05.367
My axe? Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:05.411 --> 22:07.282
Slow down. I'm gonna chop off your cuffs.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.197
Come on. I went to archery camp,
I got great aim.

22:09.240 --> 22:12.026
Archery camp? Sit.

22:12.069 --> 22:15.638
Look, the plan is to get
the cops here so we can prove

22:15.682 --> 22:17.248
your life's in danger
and negotiate your release.

22:17.292 --> 22:18.859
At least this way,
you'll be handcuff-free

22:18.902 --> 22:20.382
in the comfort of your own home.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.123
Put them up.

22:24.081 --> 22:26.040
Don't look at me.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.607
Three, two...
[thud]

22:38.226 --> 22:39.880
Mrs. Dodd?

22:39.923 --> 22:41.708
Yes?

22:44.841 --> 22:46.800
How are you feeling today?

22:46.843 --> 22:49.193
Just fine.

22:49.237 --> 22:51.108
What do you want?

22:51.152 --> 22:54.547
I actually want to talk to you
about your daughter. Lucy?

22:55.635 --> 22:57.637
What about her?

22:59.465 --> 23:03.686
Did Lucy ever do
anything to upset you?

23:03.730 --> 23:06.950
What hasn't she done
to upset me?

23:06.994 --> 23:10.693
Out all hours of the night
with the wrong people.

23:10.737 --> 23:12.956
Even last Friday.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.698
What date was last Friday?

23:15.742 --> 23:19.006
17th of September.

23:23.053 --> 23:25.534
In-in 1999?

23:25.578 --> 23:27.493
Of course.

23:27.536 --> 23:30.017
Wait.

23:30.060 --> 23:32.062
Come closer.

23:36.980 --> 23:39.592
Kate Drew. You're Lucy's
guidance counselor.

23:39.635 --> 23:42.116
I didn't recognize you
without my glasses.

23:42.159 --> 23:44.379
What do you want?

23:44.423 --> 23:47.077
Did Lucy finally convince
you I'm the Wicked Witch?

23:47.121 --> 23:48.731
Why would she do that?

23:48.775 --> 23:50.516
Because she's starved
for attention.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.039
Haven't you figured
that out yet?

23:54.084 --> 23:56.826
Mrs. Dodd,
Lucy's friends at school

23:56.870 --> 24:00.134
have started saying some
really unkind things about her.

24:00.177 --> 24:01.657
Rumors.

24:01.701 --> 24:03.746
That's all they are.
Rumors.

24:03.790 --> 24:06.923
Those kids will never know
the truth about my Lucy.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.969
I made sure of that.

24:10.057 --> 24:11.493
What did you do?

24:11.537 --> 24:14.278
Mrs. Dodd,
did you hurt Lucy?

24:14.322 --> 24:15.976
Course not.

24:16.019 --> 24:18.282
Do you know someone
who could have? Could have done what?

24:18.326 --> 24:20.110
Lucy's fine.

24:20.154 --> 24:23.200
Last time I saw her, she...

24:25.202 --> 24:28.162
[exhales, inhales sharply]

24:28.205 --> 24:29.903
I'm so sorry.

24:29.946 --> 24:32.035
I didn't, um... She didn't come home.

24:32.079 --> 24:34.081
Oh, no, no.

24:34.124 --> 24:35.778
Not my Lucy.

24:35.822 --> 24:37.954
She can't be gone.
She...

24:37.998 --> 24:40.261
Who the hell are you?

24:40.304 --> 24:42.959
You're not Kate Drew. I-I'm her daughter.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.700
All you want
to talk about is Lucy.

24:44.744 --> 24:45.875
You're just like
that other lady.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.181
What other lady?

24:47.224 --> 24:49.270
The one that left me the
key to Lucy's secret.

24:49.313 --> 24:50.967
But no one will ever
find it because I hid it.

24:51.011 --> 24:53.535
Where did you hide the key?

24:53.579 --> 24:57.147
Someplace no one
will ever find it.

24:58.627 --> 25:01.108
In the thin man's book. Is that here?

25:01.151 --> 25:02.892
At Larkspur Lane?

25:03.937 --> 25:07.593
He calmed the sea
with a whisper.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.029
Who are you talking about? He stilled

25:09.072 --> 25:10.813
the storm with a whisper,

25:10.857 --> 25:12.598
and the waves of
the sea were hushed.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.251
Patrice, I... Get out.

25:14.295 --> 25:17.167
Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get...

25:19.256 --> 25:21.258
Lucy!

25:31.268 --> 25:32.531
ACE:
Hello? Ace, it's Karen.

25:34.228 --> 25:35.664
Listen,

25:35.708 --> 25:37.448
I've told everyone here

25:37.492 --> 25:39.886
that you're a good kid.

25:39.929 --> 25:41.452
But I need you
to be honest with me.

25:41.496 --> 25:42.889
Okay, is anyone hurt?

25:43.933 --> 25:45.500
No.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.458
I-I mean, not yet.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.330
Did Carson put you up to this?

25:49.373 --> 25:50.897
No, this was my idea.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.638
Hey, Ace, give me the phone.

25:52.681 --> 25:55.162
No, I'm not...
I'm not gonna... Give me the phone. Okay.

25:55.205 --> 25:57.686
Then demand
an emergency hearing.

25:57.730 --> 26:01.037
I demand an emergency
hearing for Mr. D.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.170
That's not gonna happen. Okay?

26:03.213 --> 26:05.694
And this won't end well
unless you...

26:05.738 --> 26:07.696
ACE:
Unless you go get the footage

26:07.740 --> 26:10.133
from Seabury County Prison
that shows

26:10.177 --> 26:12.614
one of Everett Hudson's
goons was gonna kill Mr. D.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.964
What?
ACE: Everett Hudson

26:15.008 --> 26:17.793
put a hit on Mr. D's
life to punish Nancy,

26:17.837 --> 26:19.403
probably keep him

26:19.447 --> 26:21.014
from spilling whatever he
knows about the Hudsons.

26:21.057 --> 26:22.798
So if you check
the security tapes

26:22.842 --> 26:25.279
from between 9:00 a.m.
and noon today,

26:25.322 --> 26:27.150
you'll see what I mean.
Okay.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.326
But I need to speak to Carson.

26:29.370 --> 26:31.590
Nope. I'm not gonna let
you try to convince him

26:31.633 --> 26:33.374
to come out with
his hands up. He...

26:33.417 --> 26:36.290
He's my hostage.

26:36.333 --> 26:39.249
Now get that footage, Karen.

26:40.294 --> 26:41.556
Too strong?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.776
If you say anything
with enough authority,

26:43.819 --> 26:46.430
people will believe it.
[exhales]

26:46.474 --> 26:49.346
Thank you.
[clears throat]

26:51.827 --> 26:55.222
You are a Marvin. Start acting
like one and stop acting

26:55.265 --> 26:56.789
like a desperate little mentee.

26:56.832 --> 26:59.139
Fake it till you make it.

27:01.707 --> 27:03.665
Like you do?

27:03.709 --> 27:05.319
[chuckles]

27:05.362 --> 27:07.147
How you pretend
to be all ice-cold

27:07.190 --> 27:08.931
and don't give a crap
about anything?

27:08.975 --> 27:10.933
You know, I might not know a
lot about the business world,

27:10.977 --> 27:13.675
but I do know about
being a human.

27:13.719 --> 27:16.983
My guess is that that cocktail ring

27:17.026 --> 27:19.289
is a gift from someone you "hate"

27:19.333 --> 27:20.508
because they hurt you.

27:20.551 --> 27:22.292
And now you wear
it as a reminder

27:22.336 --> 27:24.947
to never let anyone get too close.

27:24.991 --> 27:28.255
You-you pretend
to not have a heart

27:28.298 --> 27:30.257
so no one takes advantage of it,

27:30.300 --> 27:31.954
but what you haven't figured out

27:31.998 --> 27:33.956
is that that's a strength.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.002
It's not a weakness.

27:38.004 --> 27:40.746
Bitchsplaining, was it?

27:40.789 --> 27:42.791
Yeah.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.319
ORDERLY [in distance]:
That makes six.

27:49.363 --> 27:52.192
[indistinct conversation]

28:04.683 --> 28:06.685
[children laughing]

28:11.080 --> 28:12.212
Nancy!

28:12.255 --> 28:13.953
Did you find

28:13.996 --> 28:16.129
Patrice's room,
or do we have to do more laps?

28:19.001 --> 28:20.960
Okay, is it just me,

28:21.003 --> 28:23.484
or is this mold
spreading really fast?

28:23.527 --> 28:25.878
Uh, yeah. It was by

28:25.921 --> 28:27.096
the security desk, too.
[sighs]

28:27.140 --> 28:28.532
When we opened the doors
to the East Wing,

28:28.576 --> 28:30.317
we must have unsealed
whatever was containing it.

28:30.360 --> 28:31.927
Great.
So, that's our cue to leave.

28:31.971 --> 28:33.537
[sighs]
Not yet. I talked to Patrice,

28:33.581 --> 28:34.756
but I didn't get anything

28:34.800 --> 28:35.931
that proves my dad's innocence.

28:35.975 --> 28:37.411
I think she has dementia.

28:37.454 --> 28:38.673
What'd she have to say
about Lucy?

28:38.717 --> 28:39.761
NANCY:
Only that she hid

28:39.805 --> 28:42.329
Lucy's secrets in a "thin man's book."

28:42.372 --> 28:44.157
Then she said something random.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.507
"He stilled the storm to a whisper.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.378
The waves of the sea were hushed."

28:48.422 --> 28:51.294
That's not random.
It's a Bible verse.

28:51.338 --> 28:52.948
From Psalms.

28:52.992 --> 28:55.690
Oh, so we go to church now? So,

28:55.734 --> 28:58.345
Patrice hid Lucy's secrets
in a thin man's Bible?

28:58.388 --> 28:59.520
Who's the thin man?

28:59.563 --> 29:01.435
I don't know.

29:02.523 --> 29:06.570
But I think I know
someone who does.

29:06.614 --> 29:07.702
GUARD:
Carson Drew!

29:07.746 --> 29:09.878
CARSON:
What is it?

29:09.922 --> 29:12.141
You're being transferred
to State.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.843
[phone rings]

29:17.886 --> 29:19.409
KAREN: Ace. Get the videos?

29:19.453 --> 29:21.020
Ace, give me the phone.

29:21.063 --> 29:23.022
Karen, listen to me.

29:23.065 --> 29:25.459
Neither of us want this
to escalate, right?

29:25.502 --> 29:27.461
Then put an end to this.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.028
Please.

29:29.071 --> 29:31.030
CARSON:
That footage

29:31.073 --> 29:33.467
proves that my life was
and is in danger,

29:33.510 --> 29:35.208
and if you show it
to Judge Edelstein,

29:35.251 --> 29:38.472
it'll get her to agree
to a pretrial release.

29:38.515 --> 29:42.302
Look, as much as I want to be
on board with that plan,

29:42.345 --> 29:44.434
the security footage
doesn't actually show

29:44.478 --> 29:45.827
anyone attempting to harm you.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.655
What?
KAREN: If someone went after you,

29:47.698 --> 29:49.222
they did it in a blind spot.

29:49.265 --> 29:51.180
Nothing was caught on tape.

29:51.224 --> 29:52.660
[sighs]

29:52.703 --> 29:54.705
Oh, no.

29:59.232 --> 30:00.407
BESS:
Why is there

30:00.450 --> 30:01.843
nothing on the tape?

30:01.887 --> 30:03.497
Ask him about...
[exclaims]

30:03.540 --> 30:05.194
Face on mute, please.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.979
[exhales]

30:07.022 --> 30:08.589
So, we need
the hit man to confess

30:08.632 --> 30:10.504
or-or some other proof?

30:10.547 --> 30:13.724
Otherwise, they're gonna send
Mr. D right back there to die.

30:13.768 --> 30:15.814
[sighs]

30:15.857 --> 30:17.511
[phone beeps]

30:17.554 --> 30:18.729
[sighs]

30:21.689 --> 30:23.125
Ryan.

30:24.605 --> 30:26.694
Carson Drew's life
is in your hands.

30:26.737 --> 30:27.782
What the hell is it
with you people?

30:27.826 --> 30:30.524
[sighs]
You can make one phone call

30:30.567 --> 30:32.134
and get him the proof he needs,

30:32.178 --> 30:34.528
or you sentence him to death.

30:34.571 --> 30:35.877
And that's on you.

30:35.921 --> 30:37.574
Not your daddy.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.534
It's not that simple.

30:40.577 --> 30:41.665
AMAYA:
Be a human, Hudson.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.667
It's a man's life.

30:43.711 --> 30:45.104
And I'll sweeten the pot.

30:45.147 --> 30:46.670
If you make this phone call,

30:46.714 --> 30:48.368
if you save Carson,

30:48.411 --> 30:49.673
the Marvins will owe you.

30:49.717 --> 30:51.458
You'll have a chip... Chit.

30:51.501 --> 30:55.549
Chit to call in with my family.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.899
You've been a Marvin for, like,
a week. Why the hell would they

30:57.943 --> 31:00.597
listen to you? Because...

31:00.641 --> 31:03.949
I made it this far
when I started out with nothing.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.951
I've done more in the last
six months to better myself

31:05.994 --> 31:07.387
than you've done
in your entire life,

31:07.430 --> 31:09.389
and because as of today,

31:09.432 --> 31:13.393
I have a badass mentor
from the Alston family empire.

31:13.436 --> 31:15.786
Assumptive close.
I hope you don't mind.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.788
I'll allow it.

31:17.832 --> 31:19.660
Anything you ask.

31:19.703 --> 31:23.011
As a Marvin,
I will make it happen.

31:28.321 --> 31:31.672
A bit ago, I saw this-this
very odd, very thin man

31:31.715 --> 31:32.803
walking down the hallway,

31:32.847 --> 31:34.283
and then every time
I looked back,

31:34.327 --> 31:36.546
it looked as though
he was farther away.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.941
Oh, mercy.

31:39.985 --> 31:41.638
You saw Mr. Roeper?

31:41.682 --> 31:43.249
Who's Mr. Roeper?

31:43.292 --> 31:45.381
Back in the 1870s,

31:45.425 --> 31:47.906
the East Wing of Larkspur Lane
was the Roeper mansion.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.517
One morning, the milkman

31:50.560 --> 31:52.301
found the parents
and their three kids

31:52.345 --> 31:54.695
lying side by side
in this one dark room...

31:54.738 --> 31:56.436
the Whisper Box.

31:56.479 --> 31:58.264
[child laughs]

32:00.092 --> 32:02.964
They'd all died overnight,
with smiles on their faces.

32:03.008 --> 32:05.488
Authorities couldn't
figure out the cause.

32:05.532 --> 32:07.708
The townspeople started saying

32:07.751 --> 32:10.754
there was something evil
that kept coming from that room.

32:10.798 --> 32:13.627
Up until about three weeks ago,

32:13.670 --> 32:15.803
the Whisper Box was
just the place

32:15.846 --> 32:17.718
where they stashed
the Roepers' old possessions,

32:17.761 --> 32:19.720
but when the hauntings
started happening,

32:19.763 --> 32:22.375
it's where the cockroaches
and mold came from.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.727
I believe it's the source
of the haunting.

32:26.770 --> 32:28.163
This is a terrible hospital.

32:28.207 --> 32:29.773
How do I get there?

32:29.817 --> 32:31.427
Nancy...
Don't do it.

32:31.471 --> 32:33.386
No one has been inside
the Whisper Box

32:33.429 --> 32:34.735
since the haunting started.

32:34.778 --> 32:37.564
I will be fine.
The Roepers died overnight.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.914
You seriously want to go
into this Whisper Box

32:39.958 --> 32:42.612
and see if Mr. Roeper's
Bible is in there?

32:42.656 --> 32:44.919
And risk a gruesome,
haunting death in the process?

32:44.963 --> 32:46.790
If it means finding
out Lucy's secrets

32:46.834 --> 32:48.923
that could exonerate
my dad, yeah.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.621
You really think we're gonna
let you go in there alone?

32:51.665 --> 32:54.189
You are on Larkspur
Lane's Most Wanted list.

32:54.233 --> 32:56.365
If they catch me with you,
this is all for nothing.

32:56.409 --> 32:58.585
What about the guy who's not
on their Most Wanted list?

32:58.628 --> 33:00.761
I will need him
to come in and save me

33:00.804 --> 33:02.937
if I am not back in ten minutes.

33:04.765 --> 33:07.072
It's gonna be great.

33:07.115 --> 33:09.944
Ten minutes!
That's it!

33:18.561 --> 33:20.563
[leaves rustling in wind]

33:21.564 --> 33:23.740
[soft, wooden creaking]

33:33.533 --> 33:35.535
[insects skittering]

33:56.295 --> 33:57.948
- ACE: Citizen Ace.
- Ace.

33:57.992 --> 33:59.994
Check your cloud.

34:03.476 --> 34:05.434
Got it.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.175
Good.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.612
Now, that link is the only thing
that there is.

34:09.656 --> 34:11.571
There is no digital footprint
that'll lead back

34:11.614 --> 34:13.660
to an identifiable source.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.662
Oh, and Ace,

34:15.705 --> 34:17.620
this makes us even

34:17.664 --> 34:19.448
for what my dad did to you.

34:19.492 --> 34:21.842
Understood.
Thank you.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.887
Yeah.

34:25.759 --> 34:27.804
DISTORTED VOICE:
Kill Carson Drew.

34:27.848 --> 34:29.850
MAN:
How do you want it done?

34:30.851 --> 34:32.635
That's Gus,

34:32.679 --> 34:34.768

By the way,

35:26.950 --> 35:28.300
I did convince Judge Edelstein

to go easy
on the 14 or 15 charges
