00:01.260 --> 00:03.421
Previously on Elementary...
WATSON: Emil Kurtz.

00:03.470 --> 00:05.267
Do I know you?

00:05.300 --> 00:08.030
We have a friend in common,
Morland Holmes.

00:08.070 --> 00:10.368
Oh, uh, nice to meet you.

00:10.410 --> 00:12.037
Morland asked me to find
the mole in his office.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.537
In other words,
he asked me to find you.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.104
What do you want?

00:16.150 --> 00:18.038
Same thing
that VinylVenue43 did.

00:18.080 --> 00:20.776
A mole inside
Morland Holmes' office.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.649
EMCEE:
Uh, our next comic tonight--

00:23.690 --> 00:25.487
I just want to warn you--

00:28.490 --> 00:31.425
(laughing)

00:31.460 --> 00:33.428
I'm serious,
but I'll-I'll let him explain.

00:33.460 --> 00:35.758
Please welcome to the stage
Mr. Eugene Hawes!

00:39.340 --> 00:41.137
Thanks. Wow.

00:41.170 --> 00:42.762
This is a good-looking crowd.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.766
Everyone's upright,
no signs of rigor mortis.

00:44.810 --> 00:46.402
I would know,
I work in a morgue.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.032
I'm a medical examiner.

00:49.610 --> 00:51.248
MAN: Hey, I thought
you were a comedian.

00:51.280 --> 00:54.477
Um, uh, well, then,
uh, sir, you'd be mistaken.

00:54.520 --> 00:56.681
Look around, this is clearly
a pathologist convention.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.154
(laughing)

00:59.190 --> 01:01.488
You were great!

01:01.520 --> 01:03.681
Four laughs, three groans;
a new personal best.
(laughs)

01:03.730 --> 01:07.222
(sighs) I have to be honest,
I was nervous for you.

01:07.260 --> 01:09.228
(scoffs) I mean, what's
the worst that could happen?

01:09.270 --> 01:10.419
A lot of these stand-ups
at these open mics

01:10.470 --> 01:11.869
talk about bombing,

01:11.900 --> 01:13.868
but, hey, I've lived
through a real bombing.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.437
People don't want to laugh
at my jokes, I'll be okay.

01:16.470 --> 01:19.371
Are you still going to therapy,
uh, the survivor meetings?

01:19.410 --> 01:20.775
Stuff like that?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:20.810 --> 01:22.175
This is just one more outlet.

01:22.210 --> 01:23.575
But I got to say,
it's my favorite.

01:23.610 --> 01:25.271
Feeling a lot better.

01:25.310 --> 01:27.119
Almost ready to get
back to work.

01:27.150 --> 01:28.617
Good. We miss you.

01:28.650 --> 01:31.141
Oh, Sherlock is sorry
that he couldn't make it.

01:31.190 --> 01:32.418
Uh, this girl that
he's been seeing,

01:32.460 --> 01:33.415
it's her birthday.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.280
"Seeing"?

01:35.320 --> 01:36.287
(phone chimes)
Like, a girlfriend?

01:36.330 --> 01:37.524
Tell me more.

01:37.560 --> 01:39.118
Oh, I wish I could.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.127
It's work.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.149
I have to go.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.792
Thanks for coming.

01:42.830 --> 01:43.865
I'll see you soon.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.720
You better.

01:55.780 --> 01:57.577
Bottom shelf.

01:57.610 --> 01:59.612
Barnaby's Historical
World Atlas.

02:02.850 --> 02:06.217
You know, we don't have to do
this whole secret agent thing.

02:06.260 --> 02:08.649
We could just, uh,
talk like normal people.

02:08.690 --> 02:10.248
That's easy
for you to say.

02:10.290 --> 02:12.656
_You're not the one
spying on Morland Holmes.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.656
KURTZ:
That's everything I could find

02:14.700 --> 02:16.327
on all our recent
dealings In Russna.

02:16.370 --> 02:20.363
I'm guessing what you're
really after is in the back.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.368
Wire transfers.

02:22.410 --> 02:24.298
He paid off four cops,
two correctional officers,

02:24.340 --> 02:27.332
and a prison warden,
all in the city of Novgorod.

02:27.380 --> 02:30.178
These are all
small sums.

02:30.210 --> 02:31.643
Do you think
they were bribes?

02:31.680 --> 02:33.238
Yeah, I made a couple calls.

02:33.280 --> 02:35.248
There's a manhunt on
for an escaped prisoner

02:35.280 --> 02:37.282
named Ruslan Krasnov.

02:37.320 --> 02:39.288
This guy killed
the wrong oligarch's son

02:39.320 --> 02:41.515
a couple years back,
got sentenced to life.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.357
Last month, he broke out.

02:43.390 --> 02:45.324
Seems Mr. Holmes
wants to find him

02:45.360 --> 02:48.329
before the Russian
authorities do.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.363
How much longer are you
gonna make me do this?

02:51.400 --> 02:52.765
I'll know when I know.

02:52.800 --> 02:56.429
You-you got me digging
into areas I don't belong.

02:56.470 --> 02:57.437
It's too risky.

02:57.470 --> 02:58.562
I'm gonna get caught.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.373
Would you rather
I tell Morland

03:00.410 --> 03:03.402
that you were selling secrets
to his competitor?

03:03.450 --> 03:05.441
Keep it up.

03:08.420 --> 03:10.741
(sighs)

03:10.790 --> 03:13.350
_ OFFICER:
Police! Stop right there!

03:13.390 --> 03:16.279
I said stop right there!

03:16.330 --> 03:17.922
I said stop!

03:17.960 --> 03:20.451
This is foot post 11-02, in
pursuit of a bag-snatch suspect.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.867
Headed west
on Sullivan and Ferris.

03:23.900 --> 03:25.788
There you go.

03:27.440 --> 03:28.338
Smart move, man.
I didn't do it.

03:28.370 --> 03:29.837
Yeah, you can save that
for the judge, man.

03:29.870 --> 03:32.509
I saw you snatch that bag.

03:32.540 --> 03:34.508
No, that's not what I mean.

03:34.540 --> 03:35.575
I didn't do that.

03:47.420 --> 03:48.819
*

03:57.870 --> 04:00.532
*

04:00.570 --> 04:03.767
(cat meows)

04:03.810 --> 04:06.529
See you've met Miss Purrdy.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.447
She was meant to be
a birthday present.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.675
Fiona, of course,
loves felines,

04:11.710 --> 04:13.268
but the feeling
was not mutual.

04:13.320 --> 04:14.378
This animal is
particular.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.671
Seems she
likes you though.

04:15.720 --> 04:17.938
She's not moving in,
is she?

04:17.990 --> 04:19.958
No, Miss Hudson seems
quite enthusiastic

04:19.990 --> 04:21.389
about adopting the beast.

04:21.420 --> 04:22.785
I'm dropping her off
later today.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.479
You may unclench.

04:24.530 --> 04:26.395
Oh.

04:26.430 --> 04:29.558
I understand Eugene had a more
successful evening than I did.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.761
Who told you that?

04:31.800 --> 04:33.768
You told an amateur comedian

04:33.800 --> 04:35.597
_ that I was _
In a new relationship,

04:35.640 --> 04:37.938
so he e-mailed me
the moment you left

04:37.970 --> 04:39.938
to get my opinion
on a five-minute riff

04:39.980 --> 04:42.346
he is developing
on the fairer sex.

04:43.680 --> 04:45.307
Wished us well on the new case,
by the way.

04:45.350 --> 04:46.510
The one which dragged you away.

04:46.550 --> 04:49.519
Mmm, it was a white lie.

04:49.550 --> 04:50.744
An old friend called to chat.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.348
I ducked out early.

04:52.390 --> 04:53.880
"An old friend." _
You're typically more expanswe

04:53.920 --> 04:55.888
after your first hit
of caffeine.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.888
Yeah, well, you brought
a bald cat to breakfast.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.989
I'm a little distracted.

05:00.030 --> 05:01.622
Well, when you recover
your wits, Marcus texted.

05:01.660 --> 05:03.525
There's been
a double homicide in Red Hook.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.390
Join us when you're ready.

05:10.610 --> 05:12.999
Good morning, Detective.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.008
BELL: I can think of two guys
who would disagree.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.406
So at first blush,

05:17.450 --> 05:19.418
it would seem that a carjacker
and his would-be prey

05:19.450 --> 05:20.849
opened fire on each other,

05:20.880 --> 05:23.019
but obviously all
is not as it appears.

05:23.050 --> 05:24.984
They both had I.D.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.385
Jared Talt's the driver.

05:26.420 --> 05:27.819
Vehicle's registered
to his company,

05:27.860 --> 05:29.828
Open Road Land Development.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.657
He might have been out here
looking at property.

05:31.690 --> 05:33.829
I don't know.

05:33.860 --> 05:35.919
Butch Callahan, meanwhile,
is an army vet.

05:35.960 --> 05:37.894
He's got a sheet,
but it's just petty larceny

05:37.930 --> 05:41.593
and a few misdemeanor
assaults and discons.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.608
Nothing in the vein

05:43.640 --> 05:45.528
of grand theft auto
or armed robbery?

05:45.570 --> 05:48.539
No, and this wouldn't
just be out of character.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.445
You-you see his belt?

05:50.480 --> 05:52.573
It was put on clockwise.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.871
I think he's a lefty.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.582
And yet the gun is
next to his right hand.

05:56.620 --> 05:58.417
Now, I can think of a few
reasons he might have ended up

05:58.450 --> 06:00.384
with the gun in his right hand,

06:00.420 --> 06:02.388
but the position of Talt's gun
looks funny to me, too.

06:02.430 --> 06:06.491
Guy gets blasted with a .45
from point-blank range,

06:06.530 --> 06:09.499
and then calmly lowers
the weapon into his lap?

06:09.530 --> 06:11.521
HOLMES:
You would expect it

06:11.570 --> 06:13.765
to end up somewhere on
the floor of the vehicle.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.768
I think someone else
killed these guys

06:15.800 --> 06:18.530
and made it look
like they shot each other.

06:18.570 --> 06:20.709
(camera flash charging)
Why is CSU using flash

06:20.740 --> 06:21.775
to take photographs
in broad daylight?

06:21.810 --> 06:23.573
They're not.

06:23.610 --> 06:25.578
Crime scene photog
went home ten minutes ago.

06:25.610 --> 06:27.419
Then what's that noise?

06:27.450 --> 06:28.644
What noise?
The norse.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.647
(camera flash charges)

06:29.690 --> 06:30.679
(camera shutter clicks)

06:34.690 --> 06:37.659
(camera flash charges)

06:37.690 --> 06:38.679
(camera shutter clicks)

06:40.560 --> 06:43.961
(camera flash charges)

06:44.000 --> 06:45.592
(camera shutter clicks)

06:48.500 --> 06:51.060
(camera flash charges)

06:51.110 --> 06:52.532
What is that?_
(camera shutter CIICkS)

06:53.940 --> 06:55.737
(camera flash charges)

06:55.780 --> 06:57.179
(camera shutter clicks)

06:57.210 --> 07:00.008
(camera flash charges)

07:00.050 --> 07:02.610
(camera shutter clicks)
HOLMES: If I had to guess,

07:02.650 --> 07:04.709
I'd say it was dropped
in Mr. Callahan's blood,

07:04.750 --> 07:07.913
cracking the lens and causing
the flash to malfunction.

07:07.960 --> 07:09.825
Probably why it was tossed.

07:09.860 --> 07:12.454
Guess he didn't want to walk
away from a double homicide

07:12.500 --> 07:13.819
carrying a strobe light.

07:15.630 --> 07:17.666
in the first place.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.497
(beeping)
BELL: What?

07:19.540 --> 07:21.565
He didn't take
a selfie, did he?

07:21.600 --> 07:23.568
No.

07:23.610 --> 07:26.670
But how often do you get to
see through the killer's eyes?

07:26.710 --> 07:28.632
(beeping)

07:30.880 --> 07:33.178
all of Jared Talt
and all the same.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.778
BELL:
Weird thing is

07:34.820 --> 07:36.617
none of them match
what we saw at the scene.

07:36.650 --> 07:41.553
Take a look at the pictures
CSU took this morning.

07:41.590 --> 07:44.184
GREGSON: He was slumped back
like that when you got there?

07:44.230 --> 07:46.152
First responders
didn't monkey with him,

07:46.190 --> 07:47.953
try to check his pulse
or something?

07:48.000 --> 07:50.594
BELL: No, we think the killer
moved him. He would have had

07:50.630 --> 07:52.598
to climb into the car to put
Mr. Talt's prints on the gun,

07:52.640 --> 07:54.198
take a shot,
stage all that.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.037
When he was through,
he left the body like this.

07:56.070 --> 07:57.537
HOLMES: There's little doubt
that those steps were taken,

07:57.570 --> 08:00.209
but they don't account
for every discrepancy.

08:01.710 --> 08:03.507
WATSON:
Why pry his eyes open?

08:03.550 --> 08:04.778
GREGSON:
That's a good question.

08:04.810 --> 08:06.710
Then again,
there are others.

08:06.750 --> 08:07.944
Why kill two guys

08:07.980 --> 08:09.618
and dress it up
like a carjacking?

08:09.650 --> 08:11.641
Why take pictures of it?

08:11.690 --> 08:13.578
Do we know if there was a
connection between the victims?

08:13.620 --> 08:15.588
Not yet. Right now
I couldn't tell you

08:15.620 --> 08:17.224
if one of them was
the intended target

08:17.260 --> 08:18.682
and the_other
was a Witness,

08:18.730 --> 08:21.096
or if they were both
victims of a thrill-kill.

08:21.130 --> 08:22.722
Well, we know that
Jared Talt was the one

08:22.770 --> 08:24.123
that the killer was
interested in.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.569
He was the wealthier of the two.

08:25.600 --> 08:26.794
Uh, maybe we should start there,

08:26.840 --> 08:28.728
get some background.

08:28.770 --> 08:30.135
I contacted his wife,
but she was up in Vermont

08:30.170 --> 08:31.569
visiting a sister.

08:31.610 --> 08:33.202
She's driving back
this afternoon.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.037
There's also a business
partner In Westchester.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.672
HOLMES:
On Butch Callahan's side,

08:36.710 --> 08:39.611
there's only his girlfriend,
Roxanne Ortiz.

08:39.650 --> 08:41.117
All right, you two
take the girlfriend.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.141
Joan and I will take
the business partner.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.112
MAN: Sorry I'm not dressed.

08:46.150 --> 08:48.948
Uh, after I got
the news about Jared,

08:48.990 --> 08:50.878
I could hardly get
out of bed.

08:50.930 --> 08:52.591
Please, don't worry about it.

08:52.630 --> 08:53.995
We're sorry for your loss.

08:54.030 --> 08:56.794
GREGSON: Uh, Mr. Potter,
we were wondering

08:56.830 --> 09:00.163
if you knew the second man
that was killed, Butch Callahan.

09:02.870 --> 09:05.202
This is the guy
who tried to carjack Jared?

09:05.240 --> 09:07.037
Well, we're not entirely
sure that's what happened.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.742
There's a good chance
that, uh, both men were killed

09:09.780 --> 09:11.179
by the same person.

09:11.210 --> 09:13.178
No.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.780
Nope, I've never seen
this man before.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.240
Um...

09:19.290 --> 09:20.814
is this Jared's desk?

09:20.860 --> 09:22.919
Yeah. (sniffles)

09:22.960 --> 09:25.724
A few deals went
belly-up last year.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.990
We could barely afford

09:28.030 --> 09:29.156
a real office,

09:29.200 --> 09:31.191
so about, uh, six months ago,

09:31.230 --> 09:32.834
my house
became our headquarters.

09:32.870 --> 09:34.599
Something like that
can put a lot of stress

09:34.640 --> 09:36.369
on a partnership.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.369
Yeah, it did.

09:39.410 --> 09:43.005
But we were friends first,
partners second.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.200
So what will happen
to your business now?

09:45.250 --> 09:48.219
Usually with
a setup like ours,

09:48.250 --> 09:50.081
assets are divided

09:50.120 --> 09:51.712
between the surviving partner

09:51.750 --> 09:54.253
and the heirs
of the deceased.

09:54.290 --> 09:57.680
Thing is we don't
currently have any assets.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.948
Just liabilities and a lawsuit.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.729
The lawsuit, was it contentious?

10:01.760 --> 10:02.966
Something that could've

10:03.000 --> 10:04.661
made Jared a target?

10:05.900 --> 10:07.265
No.

10:07.300 --> 10:08.631
I don't think so.

10:08.670 --> 10:11.104
(sniffles)

10:11.140 --> 10:12.698
We bought this acreage
a stone's throw

10:12.740 --> 10:15.379
from Lake Placid.

10:15.410 --> 10:19.198
Geologists told us there
was big fracking potential.

10:19.250 --> 10:23.209
We were just about to flip the
mineral rights to an oil company

10:23.250 --> 10:26.048
when the governor
banned fracking.

10:26.090 --> 10:28.217
Just our luck, only state
in the country to do it.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.989
The oil company put
the brakes on the deal,

10:30.030 --> 10:33.329
Jared and I got stuck
with this, a white elephant.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.759
So you're suing.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.121
The State of New York, right.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.968
Us and few other businesses.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.231
That is not looking good.

10:43.270 --> 10:45.830
Look, I'm not a big fan of
anyone in the governor's office.

10:45.870 --> 10:48.771
But no, I don't think
any of them wanted Jared dead.

10:48.810 --> 10:50.846
Uh, last question.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.438
We got to ask.

10:52.480 --> 10:53.674
Where were you last night?

10:53.720 --> 10:55.938
I was cooped up here all day,

10:55.980 --> 10:57.880
grinding on a re-fi,

10:57.920 --> 10:59.956
so I went to a Knicks game
to unwind.

10:59.990 --> 11:03.926
Not that they're making
unwinding very easy this year.

11:05.760 --> 11:08.194
I went with friends.

11:08.230 --> 11:10.790
I'll give you their names.

11:12.230 --> 11:13.788
This is the other guy?

11:13.840 --> 11:15.239
BELL:
Jared Talt.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.000
I don't know him.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.099
I don't think
Butch knew him.

11:21.140 --> 11:23.074
But then again,
what do I know?

11:23.110 --> 11:24.748
Butch was Butch.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.374
A lot of people loved him.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.742
We reviewed his arrest
record thIs mornIng.

11:30.790 --> 11:32.212
It would seem that
there were some people

11:32.250 --> 11:34.013
he didn't get along with.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.413
(laughs)

11:35.460 --> 11:36.757
You're talking
about the bar fights.

11:36.790 --> 11:38.781
But that was years ago.

11:38.830 --> 11:40.889
When I met Butch,
he'd come back from Afghanistan.

11:40.930 --> 11:43.364
He was drinking.

11:43.400 --> 11:46.119
He had a really hard time
readjusting.

11:46.170 --> 11:48.832
People do.

11:48.870 --> 11:51.407
But I got him into
a program at the VA.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.774
We were talking
about getting married.

11:57.980 --> 12:01.245
I think he was gonna ask me
one of these days.

12:03.420 --> 12:05.741
That would've been good.

12:05.790 --> 12:07.951
BELL:
I'm sorry, there's
just a few more things

12:07.990 --> 12:09.855
you could help us with.

12:09.890 --> 12:11.380
There was a gun
found next to Butch.

12:12.960 --> 12:15.349
Was it a .45?
A Colt?

12:15.400 --> 12:16.424
Yep.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.532
ROXANNE:
That was his dad's.

12:20.570 --> 12:21.889
He would carry it sometimes.

12:21.940 --> 12:24.306
I didn't like it.

12:24.340 --> 12:25.967
But it was the city.

12:26.010 --> 12:28.035
Butch would always say,
"It's dangerous out there."

12:28.080 --> 12:31.072
Looks like it was pretty
dangerous in here as well.

12:31.110 --> 12:32.771
What the hell is that?!

12:32.820 --> 12:34.469
Looks like a bloody shirt to me.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.873
You never seen it before?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.541
What about this one?

12:38.590 --> 12:39.545
No.

12:39.590 --> 12:41.785
No?

12:41.820 --> 12:43.378
(sucking)

12:44.830 --> 12:46.855
Food coloring.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.322
And corn syrup.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.260
That's not blood?
No.

12:50.300 --> 12:54.066
But it is proof
of a conspiracy.

12:54.100 --> 12:56.568
(elevator bell dings)

12:56.600 --> 12:58.932
Hi, got your text.
What's up?

12:58.970 --> 13:01.074
I need you to pick out
a shirt for me.

13:01.110 --> 13:03.908
Can you tell which one
of these Jared Talt

13:03.950 --> 13:06.305
was wearing when he
was killed last night?

13:09.990 --> 13:11.014
He wasn't wearing any of them.

13:11.050 --> 13:12.312
None of them have bullet holes.

13:12.350 --> 13:13.954
That's right.

13:13.990 --> 13:16.117
They are otherwise identical
to the one he died in.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.584
They're the same brand,
same size, same color.

13:19.630 --> 13:21.825
What?
Magic Marker--?

13:21.860 --> 13:23.862
What are these?
Failed experiments.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.458
This one was done
with food coloring.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.990
This one with paint.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.338
I found them
in Butch Callahan's rubbish bin.

13:29.370 --> 13:30.962
So, what was he doing
with three different versions

13:31.010 --> 13:34.138
of Jared Talt_'s shirts
spattered WIth red?

13:34.180 --> 13:35.932
He was trying to determine

13:35.980 --> 13:38.039
which type of fake blood
was most photogenic.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.275
Ultimate he went with pig's
blood from the butcher's--

13:40.320 --> 13:42.049
a wise, if obvious choice.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.048
The lab already confirmed it.

13:45.150 --> 13:48.017
So that camera you found,

13:48.060 --> 13:49.857
it didn't belong to the killer.

13:49.890 --> 13:51.323
It belonged to Butch Callahan.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.488
He took this photograph
of Jared Talt,

13:54.530 --> 13:57.522
while Mr. Talt was still
very much aIIve.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.030
That's why his body

14:03.070 --> 14:04.901
was in a different position
when we found him.

14:04.940 --> 14:06.202
Here he was still

14:06.240 --> 14:09.129
quite capable
of moving around.

14:09.180 --> 14:11.899
So they did know each other.

14:11.950 --> 14:15.374
Evidently well enough to engage
in a rather strange conspiracy.

14:15.420 --> 14:16.546
I'm quite convinced that they
were staging a fake murder,

14:16.580 --> 14:17.581
when they fell victim
to two real ones.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.320
So two nights ago,
Butch Callahan

14:25.360 --> 14:27.294
was helping to stage
Jared Talt's murder,

14:27.330 --> 14:29.093
when someone came along

14:29.130 --> 14:30.961
and shot them both for real.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.399
The shooter got Callahan first,

14:32.430 --> 14:36.366
and then he used
Callahan's gun to shoot Talt,

14:36.400 --> 14:39.335
so it looked like the two
of them killed each other.

14:39.370 --> 14:40.678
That's what we think.

14:40.710 --> 14:44.339
Does anyone have
any idea why Talt

14:44.380 --> 14:46.109
would fake his own murder?

14:46.150 --> 14:48.118
Well, we think perhaps
someone wanted him dead

14:48.150 --> 14:49.947
The photographs
that Callahan took

14:49.990 --> 14:51.946
were meant to fool
that individual.

14:51.990 --> 14:54.151
How long can you fool someone
without a body?

14:54.190 --> 14:55.214
WATSON:
Not very.

14:55.260 --> 14:56.318
But think of the scam

14:56.360 --> 14:57.622
the police use to catch people

14:57.660 --> 14:59.218
who want to hire a hit man.

14:59.260 --> 15:00.397
Husband wants his wife dead,

15:00.430 --> 15:01.522
so he contracts her murder.

15:01.560 --> 15:02.959
Only he doesn't realize

15:03.000 --> 15:04.365
he's hired an undercover cop.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.618
Cop takes pictures of his wife,
who looks dead.

15:06.670 --> 15:08.137
Shows them to the husband.

15:08.170 --> 15:09.330
Husband pays up.

15:09.370 --> 15:10.268
Cop arrests him.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.335
So, okay, in this scenario,

15:12.370 --> 15:14.304
Butch Callahan
is the cop, right?

15:14.340 --> 15:17.241
Someone hired him
to kill Jared Talt.

15:17.280 --> 15:20.078
Only instead of going
through with it,

15:20.120 --> 15:22.543
he went straight to Talt
and told him everything.

15:22.580 --> 15:24.514
And instead of going
to the police

15:24.550 --> 15:27.087
and asking them to build a case,

15:27.120 --> 15:29.680
they start doing it
themselves-- why?

15:29.720 --> 15:30.721
HOLMES: We think
that blackmail

15:30.760 --> 15:32.455
was their ultimate goal.

15:32.490 --> 15:34.048
BELL:
A couple days before he died,

15:34.100 --> 15:36.318
Butch Callahan went
to an electronics store

15:36.360 --> 15:39.158
and bought a pen with
a microphone hidden in the tip.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.395
We figure he was gonna use it
to record the conversation

15:41.440 --> 15:42.691
with the guy who hired him

15:42.740 --> 15:45.106
after the guy got a look
at the fake pictures.

15:45.140 --> 15:48.007
Except he and Talt
never got that far.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.576
The person who hired Butch

15:49.610 --> 15:52.204
must've caught
onto the double-cross.

15:52.250 --> 15:55.447
So he killed Butch
and Jared Talt himself.

15:55.480 --> 15:58.540
So the question is who wanted
Jared Talt dead so badly

15:58.590 --> 16:01.582
that he hired a hit man
to make it happen?

16:01.620 --> 16:03.656
Mrs. Talt is on her way here.

16:03.690 --> 16:07.490
Strikes me as
an excellent person to ask.

16:07.530 --> 16:11.022
I'm sorry again
I couldn't be here yesterday.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.288
But it was good
to be with my sister.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.433
She took care of me.

16:15.470 --> 16:17.358
Got me on the road this morning.

16:17.410 --> 16:20.436
Things were good
between you and your husband?

16:20.480 --> 16:22.630
Of course, why?

16:22.680 --> 16:24.272
Did he have any enemies?

16:24.310 --> 16:26.107
Anyone who might've
wished him ill?

16:26.150 --> 16:28.277
Jared was killed
by a car-jacker.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.641
They shot each other.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.510
So why do you want
to know about my marriage?

16:32.550 --> 16:34.586
Why would you ask
if he had enemies?

16:34.620 --> 16:36.178
Well, since yesterday,

16:36.220 --> 16:39.053
some, uh, new details
have come to light, so...

16:39.090 --> 16:41.399
And our theory about the
crime is a little bit,

16:41.430 --> 16:43.466
uh, fluid at the moment.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.320
There's a chance
your husband died,

16:45.370 --> 16:47.588
because someone
wanted hIm dead.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.596
I don't get it.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.461
Are-are you saying you think
what happened to Jared was...

16:52.510 --> 16:56.207
arranged by someone?

16:56.240 --> 16:58.674
It's something
we're considering.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.287
That son of a bitch!

17:03.320 --> 17:04.514
VVho?

17:04.550 --> 17:06.040
Davis.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.058
Davis Potter,
his business partner?

17:08.090 --> 17:10.126
MRS. TALT:
They've been arguing a lot.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.391
The company's been losing money
for a long time now.

17:13.430 --> 17:14.749
It was affecting me and Jared,

17:14.800 --> 17:16.495
our home life.

17:16.530 --> 17:18.498
I didn't love him any less.

17:18.530 --> 17:21.693
But we had to take out
a second mortgage.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.765
_ Cash out _
our |Ife Insurance po|Icy.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.233
We-we sold our boat,

17:26.270 --> 17:28.431
Jared's coin collection.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.448
Even my engagement ring.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.448
Davis, though,
he comes from money.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.277
He has a trust fund.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.515
He isn't married.

17:36.550 --> 17:38.586
And they got
in a huge fight last week.

17:38.620 --> 17:41.350
Jared wanted him to unload
some pIece of property,

17:41.390 --> 17:42.414
but he refused.

17:42.460 --> 17:44.758
"Don't push me," he said.

17:44.790 --> 17:47.554
You want to talk to someone
who would've hurt Jared?

17:47.600 --> 17:50.398
You talk to him.

17:50.430 --> 17:52.625
GREGSON:
Well, if she's right,

17:52.670 --> 17:54.399
Davis Potter really
is behind the shootings,

17:54.440 --> 17:56.431
he couldn't have
pulled the trigger himself.

17:56.470 --> 17:57.402
His story checked out.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.806
Three buddies and a couple
of security cameras

17:59.840 --> 18:01.171
put him at the Knicks game

18:01.210 --> 18:02.734
at the time of the murders.

18:02.780 --> 18:04.509
Of course they did--
would be a shame to let

18:04.550 --> 18:06.472
such an ironclad
aIIbI go to waste.

18:06.510 --> 18:09.445
Meaning what?
Well, I imagine the game

18:09.480 --> 18:11.448
was part of the original
plan of Butch Callahan.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.811
Why his partner was being
perforated several miles away,

18:13.860 --> 18:15.851
he's got club-level
seats at the Garden.

18:15.890 --> 18:18.723
When he realized that Butch
was planning to betray him,

18:18.760 --> 18:20.819
he hired a second hit man.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.498
A far more dependable
one, obviously.

18:22.530 --> 18:23.827
Hmm.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.395
Well, so much for catching him
by surprise.

18:26.430 --> 18:28.569
I'll have Marcus comb through
his phone records again.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.261
If he did hire a second gunman,

18:30.310 --> 18:32.870
maybe we'll find
some trace of it.

18:32.910 --> 18:35.276
Keep us posted, will you?

18:35.310 --> 18:37.608
What, you're not coming
back to the station?

18:37.650 --> 18:39.504
We have an appointment to keep
with a private client.

18:39.550 --> 18:41.609
I've, uh, summoned a car
to come pick us up.

18:43.490 --> 18:46.516
I'll let you know when
I get Potter on a leash.

18:46.550 --> 18:49.485
We don't have a meeting
with a private client.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.681
No, we've got business
to attend to here.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.618
Obviously, you want to poke
around in there, but I'm sure

18:53.660 --> 18:55.696
you saw the same alarm sensors
on the windows that I did.

18:55.730 --> 18:57.925
Mr. Potter's security system
is top of the line.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.564
I've defeated that brand on only
three out of 13 occasions,

19:00.600 --> 19:02.636
so breaking in would
virtually guarantee

19:02.670 --> 19:04.365
a visit from the police.

19:04.410 --> 19:05.763
So obviously we should do it.

19:05.810 --> 19:07.630
No, you misunderstand.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.830
I've got no intention
of infiltrating the house.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.610
Did you know, Watson, 90% of
homes with security systems

19:18.650 --> 19:21.517
fail to include sensors
on the garage doors?

19:21.560 --> 19:23.619
Well, I do now.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.252
I saw these through the window.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.655
Thought it might contain data,
which would shed

19:26.690 --> 19:28.248
a more vivid light
on the alleged rift

19:28.300 --> 19:30.723
between Messrs.
Potter and_ Talt.
(phone chImes)

19:32.570 --> 19:33.969
Hmm.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.262
I have to go.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.562
Now?
Yeah.

19:36.600 --> 19:37.498
It's my mother.

19:37.540 --> 19:38.802
My stepfather was supposed

19:38.840 --> 19:40.501
to take her to_see
her neurologIst,

19:40.540 --> 19:42.599
but he's stuck in a meeting
with his publisher.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.574
I've got a car
coming for real now.

19:44.610 --> 19:46.202
I'm gonna meet them
on the corner,

19:46.250 --> 19:47.547
so the driver
doesn't see you.

19:47.580 --> 19:49.946
I'll-I'll call you
when I'm done, okay?

19:59.390 --> 20:01.722
I didn't expect you to ask
for a meeting so soon.

20:01.760 --> 20:04.365
Yeah, well,
this is the last one.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.265
Excuse me?

20:06.300 --> 20:07.665
Yesterday, my assistant
was out sick.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.634
So I asked one of the
secretaries down the hall

20:09.670 --> 20:11.467
to print out a
contract I needed.

20:11.510 --> 20:13.398
And when I found my own
copy later that night,

20:13.440 --> 20:15.328
I realized something
was wrong, look.

20:16.610 --> 20:18.646
These look like
the same document.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.772
Exactly.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.539
They look like
the same document,

20:21.580 --> 20:22.672
but they aren't.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.847
Check the end of the
second paragraph.

20:24.890 --> 20:27.552
There's an extra space
after the period here,

20:27.590 --> 20:29.410
but not here.

20:29.460 --> 20:31.724
It isn't a typo-- I asked
a few other secretaries

20:31.760 --> 20:33.591
for copies of
the same contract.

20:33.630 --> 20:36.952
Every one has that extra
space in a different place.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.696
Mr. Holmes hired you to find
a mole in his office.

20:39.730 --> 20:41.288
You told him
there wasn't one,

20:41.340 --> 20:42.693
but obviously he
didn't believe you.

20:42.740 --> 20:44.298
You think he's fishing.

20:44.340 --> 20:46.433
He marked each copy differently.

20:46.470 --> 20:48.472
So that if the document
was leaked,

20:48.510 --> 20:49.875
he would know
where It came from.

20:49.910 --> 20:51.605
It's more than that.

20:51.650 --> 20:52.799
This morning,
he took me off

20:52.850 --> 20:54.442
of one project and
put me on another.

20:54.480 --> 20:55.617
No explanation.

20:55.650 --> 20:57.311
I think he's onto me.
Emil?

20:57.350 --> 20:58.942
No, we're done.

20:58.990 --> 21:01.914
Because if I keep helping you,
we are both gonna get caught.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.258
Don't contact me again.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.019
(door opens)

21:13.370 --> 21:14.598
(sighs)

21:18.440 --> 21:20.067
Uh, this is new.

21:20.110 --> 21:21.839
Well, actually, it's very old.

21:21.880 --> 21:24.371
It's a 1941 Indian Scout.

21:24.410 --> 21:27.447
Extremely rare
vintage motorcycle.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.072
Can I assume this is
the same VIntage motorcycle

21:29.120 --> 21:30.849
that was in_ Davis Potter's
garage thIs afternoon?

21:30.890 --> 21:33.814
You know me, Watson;
sticlq fingers.
Why...

21:33.860 --> 21:34.986
When the contents of
Mr. Potter's filing cabinet

21:35.020 --> 21:36.658
proved disappointing,

21:36.690 --> 21:38.851
I couldn't help but look over
his beautiful motorcycle.

21:38.890 --> 21:40.926
I only meant
to admire it,

21:40.960 --> 21:42.928
so imagine my surprise

21:42.960 --> 21:44.621
when I found this

21:44.670 --> 21:46.592
in the saddlebag.

21:46.630 --> 21:47.836
It's a mileage log.

21:47.870 --> 21:49.895
As you may
or may not

21:49.940 --> 21:52.363
be aware,
antique vehicle owners

21:52.410 --> 21:53.729
often keep records
of their trips

21:53.780 --> 21:55.008
so they can ensure
that maintenance

21:55.040 --> 21:56.803
is performed
at proper intervals.

21:56.840 --> 21:59.104
If you look at
the most recent entry,

21:59.150 --> 22:00.947
you'll see that Mr. Potter

22:00.980 --> 22:04.689
logged a trip of 580 miles
the same day

22:04.720 --> 22:07.814
that Butch Callahan
and Jared Talt were murdered.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.727
Well, he told me and the captain
that he never left the house.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.625
He lied. Presumably
because he doesn't want

22:12.660 --> 22:14.355
the police to know
where he'd been.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.699
Well, there are no destinations
in here, only mileages.

22:17.730 --> 22:20.119
Hence my borrowing
of the motorcycle.

22:20.170 --> 22:22.035
I wanted to know where
he'd been that day.

22:22.070 --> 22:23.935
I've been examining it
for the last few hours,

22:23.970 --> 22:26.461
and I've found
exactly two clues.

22:26.510 --> 22:29.035
First, a geological analysis
of the sediment

22:29.080 --> 22:30.968
in the tire tread has yielded,

22:31.010 --> 22:32.568
amongst other,
more common minerals,

22:32.610 --> 22:35.044
traces of migmatite,
granulite and monzonite.

22:35.080 --> 22:38.709
Secondly...

22:38.750 --> 22:40.752
this was trapped
in the air filter.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.988
An insect wing.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.749
From a Boreal Snaketail
dragonfly.

22:46.790 --> 22:48.997
So how do a dragonfly wing

22:49.030 --> 22:50.691
and some strange
minerals tell us

22:50.730 --> 22:52.721
where_Davis Potter
drove hIs motorcycle?

22:52.770 --> 22:55.762
If Mr. Potter logged a trip
of 580 miles,

22:55.800 --> 22:57.563
the very furthest
he could've driven

22:57.610 --> 22:59.430
in any one direction
is half that amount.

22:59.470 --> 23:00.801
290 miles.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.432
(snaps fingers)

23:02.480 --> 23:03.970
The radius of this red circle

23:04.010 --> 23:06.843
is exactly that distance.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.644
So Davis went to a point
somewhere inside it.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.819
The only area in there
with deposits of migmatite,

23:11.850 --> 23:14.751
granulite and monzonite
and a documented population

23:14.790 --> 23:16.712
of the Boreal Snaketail
dragonfly

23:16.760 --> 23:18.421
is a stretch of forest here,

23:18.460 --> 23:19.984
just southwest
of Lake Placid.

23:20.030 --> 23:21.054
Unfortunately,

23:21.100 --> 23:22.590
it has an area of

23:22.630 --> 23:24.166
20 square miles,
too large to suggest

23:24.200 --> 23:25.929
a specific answer to our query,

23:25.970 --> 23:27.835
but it's a start.
How's your mother, by the way?

23:27.870 --> 23:29.792
Uh... she's fine.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.603
Thanks.
WaIt a mInute.

23:31.640 --> 23:33.437
Davis said that he and Jared

23:33.480 --> 23:35.971
owned property a stone's throw
from Lake Placid.

23:36.010 --> 23:38.001
So that must've been
where he went.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.677
But why would he lie
to us about it?

23:41.720 --> 23:43.813
I know a way to find out.

23:43.850 --> 23:45.818
(duck quacks)

23:45.850 --> 23:47.989
WATSON:
So, I walked all the way

23:48.020 --> 23:50.818
to the eastern edge
of the property,

23:50.860 --> 23:52.487
and I did not find a thing.

23:52.530 --> 23:53.724
No dead bodies,

23:53.760 --> 23:55.853
no secret hideouts,

23:55.900 --> 23:57.868
no smoke monster.

23:57.900 --> 23:59.492
There's plenty of mud, though.

23:59.530 --> 24:00.861
I hope,
for Jared's sake,

24:00.900 --> 24:03.607
that he wasn't killed
over just some wet dIrt.

24:03.640 --> 24:04.834
What about you?

24:04.870 --> 24:06.758
How'd you manage
to stay so clean?

24:06.810 --> 24:08.175
I never left this spot.

24:08.210 --> 24:10.098
You're joking.

24:10.140 --> 24:11.949
We were supposed to split up.

24:11.980 --> 24:13.914
Have you seriously been
sitting there the whole time?

24:13.950 --> 24:15.770
Yeah.
But... look at me.

24:15.820 --> 24:17.549
Look at my clothes.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.649
I saw a freakin' bear out there.

24:19.690 --> 24:21.612
Did you also see plants
such as these?

24:23.890 --> 24:25.926
Yeah, they're ginseng plants.
They're everywhere. So?

24:25.960 --> 24:28.121
They're not just ginseng plants.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.822
They're old-growth
ginseng plants.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.638
I think this
root system

24:34.670 --> 24:36.262
is somewhere between
ten and 15 years old.

24:36.300 --> 24:39.508
Have you any idea how rare
old-growth ginseng is?

24:39.540 --> 24:41.735
I mean, I know it's expensive.

24:41.780 --> 24:43.748
Try $1,400 a pound.

24:43.780 --> 24:44.940
(sighs)

24:44.980 --> 24:46.277
There are plants as far
as the eye can see.

24:46.310 --> 24:48.039
While I awaited
your return,

24:48.080 --> 24:49.638
I did my sums.

24:49.680 --> 24:50.908
The current value
of old-growth ginseng

24:50.950 --> 24:52.815
times the square footage
of this property

24:52.850 --> 24:55.887
minus the areas occupied
by other visible flora...

24:55.920 --> 24:57.080
Davis Potter
told you

24:57.120 --> 24:58.929
this property was worthless.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.825
I'd estimate its value to be
somewhere in neighborhood of...

25:00.860 --> 25:02.691
$20 million?

25:12.870 --> 25:15.304
Is this some kind of a joke?

25:15.340 --> 25:17.979
Why would I want
Jared dead?

25:18.010 --> 25:19.204
The guy was
my best friend.

25:19.250 --> 25:20.911
Was your friend,

25:20.950 --> 25:22.815
until you paid
to have him killed.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.647
Why would I do that?

25:24.690 --> 25:26.942
Jared dying...
it's going to ruin me.

25:26.990 --> 25:29.185
That's true, but not
in the way that you mean.

25:29.220 --> 25:31.085
Taking on Jared's
share of your debt

25:31.130 --> 25:32.927
wouldn't have been cheap,
but it would've paled

25:32.960 --> 25:34.621
in comparison
to what you'd get

25:34.660 --> 25:37.629
as the sole owner
of your most valuable property.

25:37.670 --> 25:38.967
Which one?

25:39.000 --> 25:41.594
Our overgrown
Putt-Putt golf course

25:41.640 --> 25:44.837
or our condemned warehouse
full of asbestos?

25:44.870 --> 25:46.098
What about the
property you visited

25:46.140 --> 25:47.630
the day Jared
was killed?

25:47.680 --> 25:49.875
Your white elephant
near Lake Placid?

25:49.910 --> 25:52.049
We know it's covered
in old-growth ginseng.

25:52.080 --> 25:54.275
Wh... old-growth what?

25:54.320 --> 25:55.719
GREGSON:
Don't.

25:55.750 --> 25:58.241
We made calls to ginseng dealers

25:58.290 --> 25:59.689
all over the state.

25:59.720 --> 26:00.789
We found one,

26:00.820 --> 26:02.981
named Xiang Wu,

26:03.020 --> 26:05.329
who said he'd met you
at the property several times.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.918
You know how much it's worth.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.257
HOLMES:
Mr. Wu, however,

26:08.300 --> 26:09.722
was unaware that you owned

26:09.760 --> 26:11.227
the property with a partner.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.090
He says he's been negotiating
with you and you alone.

26:13.130 --> 26:14.893
BELL:
Jared's wife told us

26:14.940 --> 26:17.636
there was one property you
absolutely refused to unload.

26:17.670 --> 26:19.308
We're guessing this is the one.

26:19.340 --> 26:21.205
See, he didn't know
anything about the ginseng,

26:21.240 --> 26:23.777
so when he pressured you
to sell the place at a discount,

26:23.810 --> 26:25.209
you made a decision.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.274
He had to go.

26:28.080 --> 26:30.219
Okay.

26:30.250 --> 26:33.083
Okay, maybe I was thinking of
screwing Jared out of his share,

26:33.120 --> 26:35.259
but I'm not a killer.

26:35.290 --> 26:37.827
I told you,
I was a Knicks game.
We know, we checked.

26:37.860 --> 26:39.725
Your alibi
is airtight.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.227
But the thing is,

26:41.260 --> 26:43.057
the penalty in New York
for soliciting a murder

26:43.100 --> 26:44.294
is the same as if you committed

26:44.330 --> 26:45.968
the act yourself.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.297
WATSON:
You lied when you said

26:47.330 --> 26:49.298
you didn't know
Butch Callahan.

26:49.340 --> 26:51.763
You were both on Scoville
High School's 1989

26:51.810 --> 26:54.108
JV basketball team.
So you hired

26:54.140 --> 26:56.279
your former teammate
to kill your

26:56.310 --> 26:58.141
current partner.

26:58.180 --> 27:00.000
Somehow, you realized
Butch had teamed with Jared

27:00.050 --> 27:02.314
to blackmail you,
so you had them both killed.

27:02.350 --> 27:05.012
That's a grand total
of three counts of soliciting

27:05.050 --> 27:07.189
and two counts of murder.

27:07.220 --> 27:09.882
Look”.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.148
you're right.

27:11.190 --> 27:13.181
Okay?

27:13.230 --> 27:15.926
I talked to Butch about Jared.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.394
I gave him
$50,000 to...

27:18.430 --> 27:21.035
help me out.

27:21.070 --> 27:23.334
He was gonna get another $50,000
after it was done.

27:23.370 --> 27:25.930
But everything else
you're saying, no.

27:25.970 --> 27:27.904
I don't know anything
about any blackmail,

27:27.940 --> 27:29.874
I don't know anything about any
second hit man. That's crazy.

27:29.910 --> 27:31.241
Do yourself a favor:

27:31.280 --> 27:33.840
give us the name
of the second guy.

27:33.880 --> 27:35.848
I just told you, I can't.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.848
There was no second guy.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.084
Nobody was more surprised

27:39.120 --> 27:41.281
than I was when they
both wound up dead.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.856
I got an e-mail from Butch

27:42.890 --> 27:44.357
the-the day before it happened.

27:44.390 --> 27:46.085
It'll prove
I'm telling the truth.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.263
GREGSON:
"We can meet after it's done.

27:53.300 --> 27:55.188
"There's a bus stop
at Van Dam and 37th.

27:55.240 --> 27:56.889
Bring the money. 2:00 am."

27:56.940 --> 27:59.363
It's from an account he created
just so we could talk

27:59.410 --> 28:01.378
about this stuff.

28:01.410 --> 28:04.402
89Wi|dcatPF@odkermail.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.099
"PF" is power forward,

28:06.150 --> 28:08.118
his position
in '89.

28:08.150 --> 28:10.948
On the Wildcats.
HOLMES: Well, that
proves that your friend

28:10.990 --> 28:13.117
is terrible at dreaming up
digital aliases,

28:13.150 --> 28:15.414
but as far as exculpating you
from the murders, it doesn't.

28:15.460 --> 28:17.883
You don't get it.
I went to that meeting.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.990
Why the hell would I do that
ifI knew they were both dead?

28:21.030 --> 28:22.292
I swear.

28:22.330 --> 28:23.354
I sat on a bench

28:23.400 --> 28:26.119
for two hours

28:26.170 --> 28:28.798
with $50,000
in a bag at my feet.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.434
When Butch never showed, I left.

28:31.470 --> 28:33.870
Somebody there

28:33.910 --> 28:36.128
had to have seen me.

28:36.180 --> 28:38.239
He's right, actually.

28:38.280 --> 28:39.804
If he's telling
the truth,

28:39.850 --> 28:41.841
somebody would've.

28:43.250 --> 28:45.741
The captain
subpoenaed the MTA

28:45.790 --> 28:47.212
for the on-board
camera footage

28:47.250 --> 28:48.751
from all three buses
that passed that stop

28:48.790 --> 28:51.452
between 2:00 and 4:00 am.
the night of the murder.

28:51.490 --> 28:53.355
He wasn't lying.

28:53.390 --> 28:54.755
At least not about this.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.256
Looks like he waited
at least two hours

28:56.300 --> 28:57.494
to pay Butch off.

28:57.530 --> 28:59.361
It's hard to imagine
why he would do that

28:59.400 --> 29:01.891
if he really did hire someone
to kill Butch and Jared.

29:01.940 --> 29:04.465
So, aside from knowing
that he'll go to prison

29:04.510 --> 29:07.331
for soliciting a murder,
we're back to square one.

29:09.110 --> 29:11.101
Or-or perhaps square two.

29:12.580 --> 29:14.343
Aside from Davis Potter,

29:14.380 --> 29:16.314
does anything else
look familiar to you?

29:16.350 --> 29:17.783
"Crystal Radio."

29:17.820 --> 29:19.117
I've seen
those posters before.

29:19.150 --> 29:21.289
Yes. That's because

29:21.320 --> 29:23.788
they're plastered
up and down the block

29:23.830 --> 29:26.253
where Butch and Jared
were slaIn.

29:26.290 --> 29:28.497
Okay, but bands slap those
things all over the place.

29:28.530 --> 29:30.964
Some do; others have it
done for them.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.461
So they thought
the two locations

29:34.500 --> 29:36.161
were well-chosen.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.464
Other than the bus passing
every hour or so,

29:38.510 --> 29:40.330
they were devoid
of surveillance cameras.

29:40.370 --> 29:42.509
They seemed like good locations
to stage a fake murder

29:42.540 --> 29:44.474
and have an illicit drop.

29:44.510 --> 29:47.001
Question is,
who scouted those places?

29:47.050 --> 29:49.143
Now, when we visited
Butch's girlfriend, Roxanne,

29:49.180 --> 29:52.286
did you notice the shirt
she was wearing?

29:52.320 --> 29:54.117
It's that one,
isn't it?

29:54.160 --> 29:55.354
"Thunderclap 8."

29:55.390 --> 29:57.017
HOLMES:
Yeah.

29:57.060 --> 29:59.449
They would appear to be
Crystal Radio's label-mates

29:59.490 --> 30:01.424
at Overmorrow Records.

30:01.460 --> 30:04.964
And look who works
in the promotions department.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.127
Roxanne Ortiz.

30:07.170 --> 30:08.865
She could've hung
those posters.

30:08.900 --> 30:11.835
You think she was in
on the blackmail plan.

30:11.870 --> 30:13.906
Her connection to the two places

30:13.940 --> 30:15.532
might be a huge coincidence,

30:15.580 --> 30:18.003
but given that two men died
at one of them,

30:18.050 --> 30:21.440
I think she deserves more
conSIderatIon as a suspect.

30:21.480 --> 30:23.072
You're wasting
your time, you know.

30:23.120 --> 30:24.348
I loved Butch.

30:24.390 --> 30:25.982
You mentioned that
on our first visit.

30:26.020 --> 30:27.487
You did not mention
that you'd been

30:27.520 --> 30:29.909
to the scene of the crime
just a few days before.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.520
I told you, I hang posters
all over the city.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.892
Including the bus stop

30:34.930 --> 30:36.522
where Butch planned
to meet Davis Potter

30:36.560 --> 30:38.494
and gather blackmail
materials against him.

30:38.530 --> 30:41.567
I can't explain why Butch
did what he did, okay?

30:41.600 --> 30:43.431
Maybe it was because we kept
talking about marriage

30:43.470 --> 30:44.562
and he thought
we needed the money.

30:44.610 --> 30:46.066
But I'm telling you,
he never told me

30:46.110 --> 30:47.463
anything about
a blackmail plan.

30:47.510 --> 30:49.569
If he had, I would've
talked him out of it.

30:52.550 --> 30:53.300
Hey!

30:55.220 --> 30:57.609
You listening now?

30:58.920 --> 31:00.114
Good.

31:00.150 --> 31:01.549
IfI was in on it,

31:01.590 --> 31:03.080
tell me why
I would've killed Butch

31:03.120 --> 31:04.553
right before he was gonna
get a bunch of money

31:04.590 --> 31:05.659
from that Potter guy.

31:05.690 --> 31:07.248
Because you saw an opportunity

31:07.290 --> 31:08.951
to commit a murder
at a tIme and place

31:09.000 --> 31:10.592
where suspicion would not
fall on you and you took it,

31:10.630 --> 31:11.995
because you had another,
more meaningful way

31:12.030 --> 31:13.429
to profit from Butch's death.

31:13.470 --> 31:14.596
What are you talking about?

31:14.640 --> 31:16.335
BELL:
We're talking about

31:16.370 --> 31:18.634
the life insurance policy
he had through the Army.

31:18.670 --> 31:20.262
Almost half a million dollars.

31:20.310 --> 31:21.538
It was about to lapse last year

31:21.580 --> 31:23.536
when you started
paying the premiums.

31:23.580 --> 31:24.877
You also became
the sole beneficiary.

31:26.680 --> 31:28.216
I did.

31:28.250 --> 31:29.478
Right after I made Butch

31:29.520 --> 31:31.442
the beneficiary on my policy.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.639
Isn't that what people do

31:32.690 --> 31:34.317
for each other
when they're in love?

31:34.360 --> 31:35.611
You find it weird

31:35.660 --> 31:37.150
that I hung posters
in two places,

31:37.190 --> 31:39.556
but you know who helped me?
Butch.

31:39.590 --> 31:41.319
Posting bills
without permission

31:41.360 --> 31:44.124
is illegal, so most of the time,
I would do it at night.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.626
He came with me.

31:45.670 --> 31:47.968
To make sure I was safe.

31:48.000 --> 31:50.468
So he knew about the two
locations, thanks to you,

31:50.500 --> 31:52.161
but you think
he chose them himself?

31:52.210 --> 31:53.609
That would explain
why my posters

31:53.640 --> 31:55.039
were there,
right?
It would.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.536
If it's true.

31:56.580 --> 31:57.706
But if it's all
the same to you,

31:57.740 --> 31:59.469
we're just going to continue

31:59.510 --> 32:00.909
having a look around.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.482
MORLAND:
Joan.

32:11.530 --> 32:12.622
Good evening.

32:12.660 --> 32:14.651
Did I frighten you?

32:16.460 --> 32:18.269
As a matter of fact, you did.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.165
Sherlock didn't tell me
you were comIng.

32:20.200 --> 32:23.067
His communication has been poor

32:23.100 --> 32:24.636
these last few weeks.

32:24.670 --> 32:26.729
I left him a message, earlier.

32:26.770 --> 32:29.409
I explained that I had left
an item in storage here,

32:29.440 --> 32:31.146
and that _I wanted
to retrIeve It.

32:31.180 --> 32:33.444
But he never responded.

32:33.480 --> 32:36.278
Are you telling me he doesn't
even know you're here?

32:36.320 --> 32:38.641
I let myself in;
I hope you don't mind.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.146
(footsteps approach)

32:41.490 --> 32:43.685
This is Mr. Coin.
He's a member

32:43.720 --> 32:45.153
of my security team.

32:45.190 --> 32:46.589
Do you mind telling me

32:46.630 --> 32:48.222
what he was doing downstairs?

32:50.130 --> 32:53.361
I thought the item in question
might be in the basement.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.662
Mr. Coin was checking.

32:54.700 --> 32:56.736
So he was poking around
in my office.

32:56.770 --> 32:59.603
You do_ recall who owns
thIs bUIIdlng, don't you?

33:01.480 --> 33:02.629
Any luck?

33:03.510 --> 33:04.704
Mmm.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.706
Well... (clears throat)

33:06.750 --> 33:08.308
we'll be on our way.

33:11.720 --> 33:14.086
Maybe you could describe this
item that you're looking for.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.553
I could try and
help you find it.

33:18.090 --> 33:20.081
It's good to see you, Joan.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.594
(door closes)

33:24.630 --> 33:26.666
WATSON:
I take it

33:26.700 --> 33:28.691
the girlfriend did not
confess last night.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.709
She offered neither confession
nor aIIbI, so, consequently,

33:31.740 --> 33:33.708
we will spend the day
sorting through

33:33.740 --> 33:36.277
the flotsam of her sad life
with Butch Callahan.

33:36.310 --> 33:37.572
Oh. Wonderful.

33:43.250 --> 33:45.582
Did your father leave you
a voicemail yesterday?

33:47.120 --> 33:48.553
As a matter of fact,
he did. Why?

33:48.590 --> 33:51.127
Did he say he'd left
something here in storage

33:51.160 --> 33:52.752
before we moved in?

33:52.790 --> 33:55.793
You gonna tell me how you knew,
or shall I guess?

33:55.830 --> 33:58.594
He was here when I got home
last night; he'd let himself in.

33:59.770 --> 34:01.658
I'll change the locks,
post-haste.

34:01.700 --> 34:03.167
Set a few traps.

34:03.200 --> 34:05.464
Do you think he was
telling the truth

34:05.510 --> 34:08.707
about wanting to, uh,
dig something out of storage?

34:08.740 --> 34:10.605
Why would he not be?

34:10.640 --> 34:12.073
(phone chimes)

34:14.220 --> 34:16.677
You'll have to continue
WIthout me.

34:16.720 --> 34:18.608
Where are you going?

34:18.650 --> 34:21.710
Marcus has asked me to return
to the home of Roxanne Ortiz.

34:21.760 --> 34:22.818
Did you guys
miss something?

34:22.860 --> 34:24.384
We must have.

34:24.430 --> 34:26.182
She set fire to
the place an hour ago.

34:28.130 --> 34:30.121
(indistinct radio chatter)

34:36.700 --> 34:38.634
HOLMES:
There are less dangerous ways
to destroy evidence.

34:38.670 --> 34:41.571
She claims that's not
why she did it.

34:41.610 --> 34:42.634
I wanted to hurt him.

34:42.680 --> 34:43.874
Hurt who?

34:43.910 --> 34:45.844
Butch.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.848
I wanted to hurt Butch.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.609
But he's dead already.

34:49.650 --> 34:51.743
I figured this is
the next best thing.

34:51.790 --> 34:54.418
This is his family home.

34:54.460 --> 34:56.212
He grew up here,
he cared about it.

34:56.260 --> 34:58.228
So I splashed

34:58.260 --> 35:00.228
some gasoline around
and lit a match.

35:00.260 --> 35:03.457
Last night, you eulogized
your great love for him.

35:05.200 --> 35:07.760
I got a call last week
from this realtor in Tahiti.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.598
He said Mr. Taft's money still
hadn't come in over the wire.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.198
I thought it was
a wrong number,

35:12.240 --> 35:14.379
but this morning,
the same guy called back,

35:14.410 --> 35:16.674
saying he received the money,

35:16.710 --> 35:18.507
and the condo was all lined up.

35:18.550 --> 35:19.676
The condo.

35:19.710 --> 35:21.473
Where Butch was running away to.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.669
He was leaving me.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.211
You think he bought
property in Tahiti

35:25.250 --> 35:26.649
under an assumed name

35:26.690 --> 35:28.282
and was gonna move there
without you?

35:28.320 --> 35:29.685
The guy said he'd been assured

35:29.720 --> 35:32.188
that the condo would
only have one occupant.

35:32.230 --> 35:35.688
And when I asked him how much
money Mr. Taft had sent,

35:35.730 --> 35:37.527
he said 25 grand.

35:37.560 --> 35:39.460
Exactly half of
what you told me

35:39.500 --> 35:41.661
Butch got for saying
he would kill the developer.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.497
I was telling you
the truth last night.

35:43.540 --> 35:44.837
Butch never
said anything

35:44.870 --> 35:46.508
about his stupid
blackmail plan.

35:47.540 --> 35:49.906
He kept it from me.

35:49.940 --> 35:51.749
Now I know why.

35:51.780 --> 35:54.613
He was gonna go be "Myron Taft"

35:54.650 --> 35:55.674
in Tahiti.

35:55.720 --> 35:57.540
Myron Taft?

35:57.580 --> 35:59.389
Yeah.

35:59.420 --> 36:01.217
Ms. Ortiz, I don't think

36:01.260 --> 36:03.387
your boyfriend was a...
very good man,

36:03.420 --> 36:06.287
but I _don't think_he was
plannIng on leaVIng you.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.223
Nor do I think you murdered him.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.488
Marcus...

36:16.340 --> 36:18.638
You get that she just
gave us motive, right?
I do.

36:18.670 --> 36:19.637
A very strong motive.

36:19.670 --> 36:20.807
It just isn't hers.

36:27.480 --> 36:29.448
(Tahitian music playing loudly)

36:35.920 --> 36:37.785
Can't you just say
"I told you so,"

36:37.820 --> 36:39.629
like a normal person?!

36:39.660 --> 36:41.924
Oh, I can't hear you over
the Tahitian nose flute.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.789
(music shuts off)
You were right, okay?

36:46.830 --> 36:49.594
I just got off the phone
with Island Breeze Properties.

36:49.640 --> 36:50.834
Were you able
to identify the realtor

36:50.870 --> 36:52.428
that called Roxanne Ortiz?

36:52.470 --> 36:53.937
It wasn't
a wrong number.

36:53.970 --> 36:55.631
"Myron Taft's" application

36:55.680 --> 36:57.636
to lease a condo Papeete

36:57.680 --> 36:59.898
came with a deposit
from Butch's bank account.

36:59.950 --> 37:01.872
I asked the realtor to describe

37:01.920 --> 37:03.444
the driver's license
they had on file.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.619
It was Jared Talt, to a T.

37:05.650 --> 37:07.447
Or, more accurately,

37:07.490 --> 37:10.709
It was Jared Talt to an F.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.024
Passable
forged IDs--

37:20.070 --> 37:22.436
difficult to come by,
very expensive.

37:22.470 --> 37:23.869
Perhaps he doctored
his own papers

37:23.900 --> 37:25.731
before he ran out
on his wife and disappeared.

37:25.770 --> 37:27.863
So Butch was just doing
his new pal a favor,

37:27.910 --> 37:29.639
helping Jared
keep her in the dark.

37:29.680 --> 37:30.874
Clearly, it didn't work.

37:30.910 --> 37:34.004
I know Roxanne Ortiz
does not exactly dIspel

37:34.050 --> 37:36.473
the myth of the woman scorned,

37:36.520 --> 37:38.442
but why do you think Ida Talt
is behind the killings?

37:38.490 --> 37:40.014
I mean, she was
in Vermont, right?

37:40.050 --> 37:42.359
Not unless they moved the
Battery Tunnel to Montpelier.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.420
Captain just sent this over.

37:45.460 --> 37:47.781
She was spotted

37:47.830 --> 37:49.889
paying a toll in the city
one hour before the murders.

37:49.930 --> 37:52.569
Someone's got
some explaining to do.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.465
Too early to turn screws
just yet.

37:54.500 --> 37:57.333
Lying about an alibi is
one thing, motive is another,

37:57.370 --> 37:59.463
but proof-- that's
something else entirely,

37:59.510 --> 38:00.909
and that, we don't have.

38:00.940 --> 38:02.669
No.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.598
But I thinkI know
where we can find some.

38:08.420 --> 38:09.978
You lied to us,
Mrs. Talt.

38:10.020 --> 38:11.009
You weren't in Vermont
WIth your SIster

38:11.050 --> 38:13.689
when Jared died;
as a matter of fact,

38:13.720 --> 38:15.017
it looks like you were in

38:15.060 --> 38:17.016
the same borough
where he was killed.

38:17.060 --> 38:18.823
HOLMES:
It's actually not unusual

38:18.860 --> 38:20.020
for people to lie
about their whereabouts

38:20.060 --> 38:21.652
when their spouses
are murdered.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.349
Everyone knows
that the police take

38:23.400 --> 38:24.924
a hard look at the
husband or the wife,

38:24.970 --> 38:26.892
so when they don't
have an alibi,

38:26.930 --> 38:28.067
they cook up a false one,

38:28.100 --> 38:29.499
even when they've got
nothing to hide.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.030
But that's not
what happened here.

38:31.070 --> 38:33.334
So you're accusing me?

38:33.370 --> 38:36.430
Your husband was planning to
blackmail his business partner

38:36.480 --> 38:38.004
and leave his life behind.

38:38.040 --> 38:40.042
You had every reason
to feel betrayed.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.616
I don't know what
you're talkIng about.

38:41.650 --> 38:43.015
Jared never would have left me.

38:43.050 --> 38:44.074
GREGSON:
No, he would have.

38:44.120 --> 38:46.680
You just never
gave him the chance.

38:46.720 --> 38:48.358
We don't presume to know
all of the secrets

38:48.390 --> 38:49.687
of your marriage.

38:49.720 --> 38:50.914
We don't know, you know,
what you knew

38:50.960 --> 38:51.984
or how you came to know it.

38:52.030 --> 38:53.782
Somehow, you had knowledge

38:53.830 --> 38:55.627
of Jared and Butch's plan
to stage a fake killing.

38:55.660 --> 38:56.797
You saw your chance.

38:56.830 --> 38:57.899
You followed them

38:57.930 --> 38:59.397
to the site they had chosen.

38:59.430 --> 39:00.499
Brought a gun with you.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.359
You shot Butch first,

39:04.410 --> 39:05.934
but not before you realized

39:05.970 --> 39:07.460
he had a weapon of his own.

39:09.510 --> 39:10.875
GREGSON:
You got a little too cute

39:10.910 --> 39:13.504
when you decided
to stage the scene

39:13.550 --> 39:15.541
as if it was a carjacking
gone wrong.

39:15.580 --> 39:16.672
'Cause that meant
there had to be

39:16.720 --> 39:18.119
gunshot residue on their hands

39:18.150 --> 39:19.708
and you had
to take care of that,

39:19.750 --> 39:21.388
plant the weapons...

39:21.420 --> 39:22.717
The thing is,
you used Butch's right hand

39:22.760 --> 39:23.988
to fire his gun.

39:24.020 --> 39:26.159
And he's left-handed.

39:26.190 --> 39:27.987
No.

39:28.030 --> 39:29.952
I don't know where
you're gettIng thIs.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.126
Right here, actually.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.167
What is that?

39:37.200 --> 39:38.929
Broken auto glass.

39:40.770 --> 39:42.806
I don't understand.
GREGSON:
You lied

39:42.840 --> 39:45.047
when you said that you
sold your engagement ring

39:45.080 --> 39:46.479
'cause you couldn't
make ends meet.

39:46.510 --> 39:47.807
You just damaged it

39:47.850 --> 39:49.841
when you climbed
into your husband's car

39:49.880 --> 39:51.484
to fire his gun.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.919
WATSON:
The recoil knocked your hand

39:52.950 --> 39:54.486
into the window frame,

39:54.520 --> 39:56.681
jarring the diamond loose
from your ring.

39:56.720 --> 39:59.154
Jared's car was placed
in impound several days ago.

39:59.190 --> 40:01.693
The interior was covered
WIth that pebble glass,

40:01.730 --> 40:04.927
so you can imagine why...

40:04.970 --> 40:06.619
nobody noticed this.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.776
I didn't realize.

40:16.810 --> 40:19.506
I woke up the next morning
and it was gone.

40:19.550 --> 40:21.541
I didn't know where it went.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.714
What are you doing?

40:28.590 --> 40:31.013
Things did not work out between
Ms. Hudson and Ms. Purrdy,

40:31.060 --> 40:32.857
so I'm posting an ad

40:32.890 --> 40:34.619
that I hope will deliver
the animal to an owner

40:34.660 --> 40:36.525
less likely
to leave Greek manuscripts

40:36.560 --> 40:38.152
in places
they might be befouled.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.998
And you're using Marcus'
computer because...?

40:41.030 --> 40:42.964
He's out.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.968
He was called to _the scene
of a shootIng.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.205
So I was told
by DetectIve Nash.

40:47.240 --> 40:48.935
The details are
stI|| comIng In.

40:48.980 --> 40:50.231
If you go home,
I wouldn't get too comfortable.

40:50.280 --> 40:52.077
Our presence
might be requested.

40:52.110 --> 40:53.941
That is assuming, of course,
you don't have any

40:53.980 --> 40:56.210
last-minute plans
with parents or old friends.

40:58.620 --> 41:01.009
Yeah, I'll keep an eye
on my phone.

41:06.060 --> 41:09.029
Marcus Bell, Major Case.

41:13.100 --> 41:14.965
What do we got?

41:15.000 --> 41:16.490
Robbery gone bad,
sounds like.

41:16.540 --> 41:19.008
The cook was back there
when it happened.

41:19.040 --> 41:20.803
Kept his head down,
but he heard the whole thing.

41:20.840 --> 41:23.673
Apparently, the guy
wanted the cash drawer.

41:25.080 --> 41:26.570
So he shot two people?

41:26.610 --> 41:28.919
Four. We just
took two more

41:28.950 --> 41:30.144
over to St. Bede's.

41:30.180 --> 41:31.681
One woman was unconscious.

41:31.720 --> 41:33.085
I don't think
she's gonna make it.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.917
Anyone see which way he went?

41:34.960 --> 41:37.087
No. He emptied the till

41:37.120 --> 41:38.758
and just strolled out
like it was nothing.

41:38.790 --> 41:40.052
That's all we know.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.929
That's one
cold psycho.

41:46.970 --> 41:48.938
To do all of this

41:48.970 --> 41:50.198
for a couple hundred bucks.

41:54.340 --> 41:56.535
Uh, you're gonna help me
till the cavalry arrives.

41:56.580 --> 41:58.229
I'll check I.D.s,
you take notes.
Yeah.

42:07.120 --> 42:08.087
First victim: Emil Kurtz.

42:08.120 --> 42:09.109
