00:33.742 --> 00:39.122
You know what your classic car needs
to stand out at the classic car show?

00:39.122 --> 00:41.791
Me, spread-eagled on your hood.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.419
Hauling ass, huh?

00:45.003 --> 00:49.758
Man, get your dang ol' thumbprints, man,
talkin' about nicotine stains, too, man.

00:49.758 --> 00:53.136
This car looks like
it was made before 1980.

00:53.136 --> 00:56.473
Good eye, Bobby.
When'd you become such a car nut?

00:56.473 --> 01:01.144
Wednesday. When I found out
that cars built before 1980

01:01.144 --> 01:04.189
are responsible for most
of the pollution in the air.

01:04.606 --> 01:08.318
Sorry, I'm going to have
to write you a ticket, Mr. Boomhauer.

01:09.736 --> 01:10.779
Mm?

01:13.907 --> 01:17.911
"You have been ticketed
by The Environmental Court,

01:17.911 --> 01:21.039
Tom Landry Middle School." What the...

01:21.039 --> 01:25.293
I know. You should appeal that
all the way to the high school.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.837
Joseph issued me one of those yesterday

01:27.921 --> 01:32.092
for pouring used motor oil
down the kitchen sink. Fascist.

01:37.806 --> 01:40.975
A D-cell in the garbage? Oh, yes!

01:41.434 --> 01:44.604
Mom, I'm going to have to write you up
for not taking this

01:44.604 --> 01:47.315
to an approved battery recycling center.

01:47.315 --> 01:50.318
Two more tickets
and I get an "A" in history.

01:50.318 --> 01:51.653
Now, what the heck

01:51.653 --> 01:55.156
does annoying your mom and Boomhauer
have to do with history?

01:55.240 --> 01:58.284
Mr. McKay says that history is past,

01:58.368 --> 02:02.497
but saving the Earth is
our present to the future.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.670
Bobby, I will have you know
that I consider myself to be one

02:08.670 --> 02:10.922
of the great environmentalists of my time.

02:10.922 --> 02:14.926
I have a plastic grocery bag
filled with plastic grocery bags

02:14.926 --> 02:17.470
that I will bring back
to the grocery store one day.

02:18.429 --> 02:19.806
Sorry.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.278
Hank, those hobos are going through
our garbage again.

02:33.278 --> 02:36.906
Ah. Accidentally throw away
one regulator valve,

02:36.990 --> 02:38.825
now we're the talk of the freight yards.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.743
There's a phone book.
- What the...

02:40.827 --> 02:44.664
- Bobby, shouldn't you be in school?
- I am in school.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.001
History with Mr. McKay.

02:48.543 --> 02:52.338
The pizza box is recyclable,
the crust is compostable, eww.

02:52.422 --> 02:56.926
And the cheese...
Don't get me started on the cheese.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.972
Huh. So you're the Mr. McKay
Bobby keeps talking about.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.349
I guess I pictured a woman.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.852
Oh, Bobby's told me a lot about you,

03:06.311 --> 03:09.272
and how you flush your urine
whether or not you've also left feces.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.775
What? You discuss this in school?

03:14.027 --> 03:16.738
Look, if you care so much
about the environment,

03:16.738 --> 03:21.576
why don't you teach these kids about
clean-burning, energy-efficient propane.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.328
"Clean-burning" propane?

03:23.328 --> 03:25.455
It's... that's funny.

03:25.788 --> 03:30.460
See, propane grills just perpetuate
the whole culture of backyard barbecues.

03:30.460 --> 03:34.255
Plastic forks, paper plates... meats.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.925
I've sold three grills today

03:36.925 --> 03:41.429
using those exact same words,
but with a more positive attitude.

03:43.723 --> 03:46.392
Don't worry. I know where he lives.

03:47.727 --> 03:52.607
And there's a summons to appear in
the middle school's environmental court.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.735
You can't just put something
in a mailbox without a stamp.

03:55.735 --> 03:59.072
- That's a federal offense.
- Oh, Hank, it is no big deal.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.407
I was in and out of court in five minutes.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.576
What? You actually went?

04:03.660 --> 04:05.119
Well, I work at that school.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.747
I cannot afford to have
any blemishes on my record.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.376
Oh, come on. Do it for Bobby.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.211
Hank, this could be his first "A"

04:13.211 --> 04:15.838
since he was in the same math class
as that Bobby Hall

04:15.922 --> 04:17.507
and brought home the wrong report card.

04:20.927 --> 04:24.138
...so help me, God.
Hey, this isn't the Bible.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.848
It's a Harry Potter book.

04:25.932 --> 04:27.934
We're not allowed to bring
the Bible to school.

04:29.477 --> 04:34.107
If it pleases the court,
I will show that my client, or Dad,

04:34.107 --> 04:38.152
is not a bad man, just an ignorant man.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.363
Here we go...

04:40.363 --> 04:44.659
Ignorance, no matter how profound
and pathetic, is not an excuse.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.787
Then I would like
to change my client's plea

04:47.787 --> 04:50.415
to guilty by reason of insanity.

04:50.415 --> 04:53.710
- What? I'm not insane.
- Your witness.

04:56.754 --> 04:59.549
I'm not a lawyer. I'm just a kid.

04:59.549 --> 05:03.052
But you, sir, disgust me.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.055
All right, that's it.
I do not plead guilty.

05:06.139 --> 05:10.810
We have a dumpster at Strickland Propane,
and we fill it with garbage.

05:10.810 --> 05:14.022
That's what it's there for.
This whole thing is ridiculous.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.940
Oh, I'll tell you what's ridiculous.

05:16.024 --> 05:20.695
The city council is considering putting
a new landfill in unincorporated Arlen.

05:20.695 --> 05:24.866
Well, what's wrong with a new landfill?
You've got to put the garbage somewhere.

05:24.866 --> 05:28.703
If we put garbage somewhere,
soon we'll be putting it everywhere.

05:28.703 --> 05:33.041
Uh, anybody want to sleep in a bed
of yucky garbage and drink toxic waste?

05:33.041 --> 05:34.208
No.

05:35.793 --> 05:40.423
Come on. McMaynerbury used the money
they got burying Houston's garbage

05:40.423 --> 05:44.635
to buy those new fire engines.
Who likes fire engines?

05:47.513 --> 05:52.060
But, Dad, if they put this one in,
it'll jeopardize an endangered species,

05:52.643 --> 05:54.645
"Algus Taxifolia."

05:55.313 --> 05:57.774
- Itchy algae.
- Itchy algae?

05:58.566 --> 06:00.693
Sounds like good riddance to me.

06:00.777 --> 06:05.031
Just because itchy algae
isn't cuddly or "good for anything,"

06:05.031 --> 06:08.451
it doesn't mean we should destroy
its habitat by draining the quarry.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.911
The quarry?

06:09.911 --> 06:12.163
That's where they're putting the landfill.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.921
I throw my insane client
on the mercy of the court.

06:20.797 --> 06:24.717
And after the weather, they did a story
about a squirrel that water-skis

06:25.051 --> 06:26.803
and I went to bed happy.

06:27.303 --> 06:32.058
Hey, uh, I just remembered that I left
my workbench in your basement, Dale.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.018
Three of us ought to be able to carry it.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.978
- Yo, man.
- No, no...

06:36.062 --> 06:38.856
Bill, Dale and I can handle it.
Thanks, anyway.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.193
Let's go, Bill and Dale.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.864
Okay.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.410
I know we agreed never
to speak of this again,

06:50.743 --> 06:53.079
but... they're going to drain the quarry.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.914
Oh, oh, God.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.417
But-but-but-but if they drain the quarry,

06:57.417 --> 06:59.710
Boomhauer will find out
what happened to...

06:59.794 --> 07:01.421
Sally!

07:08.428 --> 07:11.722
- No... no, no!
- No, no.

07:11.806 --> 07:14.183
We agreed never
to speak of that day again.

07:14.684 --> 07:18.813
I remember. Believe me... I remember.

07:20.857 --> 07:24.193
Naw, I wish
Boomhauer would let us ride in his car.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.697
How can we be wild and crazy guys

07:28.030 --> 07:29.991
if we're stuck standing around
all the time?

07:30.700 --> 07:33.369
Hey, baby.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.745
Yo.

07:40.376 --> 07:44.505
Wait a second. Kid Dy-no-mite has got it.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.675
Why don't we take Boomhauer's car
for a joyride?

07:47.675 --> 07:50.386
Joyride? That sounds fun.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.847
And you know what would be even more fun?

07:52.847 --> 07:56.058
If after we drive it, we fill it with gas

07:56.142 --> 07:59.770
so the next time Boomhauer uses it,
he's like, how'd that happen?

08:03.900 --> 08:07.236
Ooh, let's go to 31 Flavors
and ask for 31 samples.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.072
It's legal and there's nothing
they can do about it.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.043
Yeah!

08:23.252 --> 08:25.963
Zingo. I'll drive.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.548
You can't handle a stick.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.637
No!

08:32.637 --> 08:34.597
You're stripping the gears, Dale!

08:35.097 --> 08:36.307
Dale, stop!

08:39.560 --> 08:42.897
The left brake's not working!

08:43.773 --> 08:45.942
That's the clutch. Hit the other pedal!

08:55.701 --> 08:58.329
Whoo, that was close!
But I think I'm okay.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.430
Boomhauer thinks some Yankees came down
and stole the car,

09:16.514 --> 09:18.641
and he's going to go
to his grave thinking that.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.560
Boomhauer's grave?

09:20.560 --> 09:24.355
Are... are you suggesting
we kill Boomhauer?

09:25.022 --> 09:26.232
Well, you're the boss.

09:27.024 --> 09:28.859
We're not killing Boomhauer.

09:28.943 --> 09:32.113
Yeah, but when they drain that quarry,
they'll find his car

09:32.113 --> 09:36.367
with our letterman jackets right inside,
and he'll want to kill us!

09:36.367 --> 09:38.286
He won't find out.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.664
Let's just say Councilman Fred Ebberd
owes me one.

09:41.664 --> 09:42.999
I voted for him.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.335
I'm leaning back towards killing him.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.964
So, you can see, Councilman Ebberd,

09:49.964 --> 09:53.926
this is a far more suitable location
for a landfill than the quarry.

09:54.010 --> 09:57.263
No, they're using that land
to build one of those new multiplexes.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.516
Looks like I'm going to be out
of a job soon, Hank.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.522
What about that gray patch
of land over there?

10:06.606 --> 10:09.567
It looks pretty useless.
It would be perfect.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.444
That's the quarry.

10:14.655 --> 10:17.450
So if you stop using newspapers,

10:17.450 --> 10:22.663
I can give you a coupon for $20 off
your first purchase of a windmill.

10:22.747 --> 10:27.084
I'm sorry I can't help you, Bobby.
I don't use newspapers.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.920
You can cancel my subscription.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.591
I want to be part of the, uh,
the solution.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.969
I thought you said tree-huggers like me
and Mr. McKay

10:37.053 --> 10:39.472
were a bunch of noodle-brained Communists.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.432
No, no.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.809
No, no, no.

10:43.893 --> 10:44.727
No.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.978
This is great!

10:46.062 --> 10:49.523
I'm going to get extra credit
for bringing you all on board.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.485
We're going to save itchy algae!

10:52.485 --> 10:55.071
Yeah. Itchy algae.

10:55.071 --> 10:57.823
Earth first. Make Mars our bitch.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.075
Whoo-hoo!

11:02.161 --> 11:05.122
I thought we were just having
a few of your classmates over,

11:05.206 --> 11:08.042
not a bunch of, uh...
who are these people?

11:08.042 --> 11:10.336
They're from Mr. McKay's yoga group.

11:10.336 --> 11:14.256
Principal Moss says our class
can't get grades for protesting,

11:14.340 --> 11:16.509
so all the other kids dropped out.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.886
But don't worry, Dad, I still care.

11:18.886 --> 11:22.056
I even wrote a slogan,
"Drain the quarry..."

11:22.056 --> 11:24.975
Dang it, Bobby.
That's exactly what we don't want.

11:25.059 --> 11:26.310
I'm not done.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.313
"Drain the quarry, you'll be sorry."

11:29.397 --> 11:31.315
Oh.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.733
Now, that is good.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.195
This is the first time in my life

11:36.195 --> 11:39.073
I've gotten you to change
your mind about something.

11:39.073 --> 11:42.076
Which one of my arguments
did you love the most?

11:42.076 --> 11:45.037
Um... oh, you know...

11:45.496 --> 11:49.166
"spaceship Earth,"
uh, "we're all in this together."

11:49.250 --> 11:52.545
You know, "random acts of," uh, whatnot.

11:52.878 --> 11:55.756
Who wants some of Peggy Hill's
rainforest cookies?

11:55.840 --> 11:58.843
They are made with sustainably
harvested Brazil nuts.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.262
All profits go
to save the rainforest.

12:03.681 --> 12:07.643
Mm!
- Uh, are those paper plates?

12:13.357 --> 12:14.608
Yes.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.571
Dang, looks like Woodstock over here.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.157
Talkin' 'bout what the dang
Sha Na Na doin' in there, man?

12:21.157 --> 12:25.953
Oh, hey, Boomhauer. Uh, we're
just saving an endangered species...

12:25.953 --> 12:27.288
Go away!

12:27.288 --> 12:29.415
You know, itchy algae that might...

12:29.415 --> 12:30.583
You heard him. Beat it.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.043
Man, dang ol' fine, man.

12:33.127 --> 12:35.880
Dang ol' do my grocery shopping
my dang self, man.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.342
Drain the quarry, you'll be sorry!

12:40.426 --> 12:43.387
Drain the quarry, you'll be sorry!

12:43.471 --> 12:45.890
Hank Hill, Strickland Propane.

12:45.890 --> 12:49.018
I am no stranger to city council meetings,

12:49.018 --> 12:52.396
having supported
your anti-skateboarding initiative,

12:52.730 --> 12:56.025
as well as the neon sign wattage limits.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.028
But today I present these petitions

12:59.028 --> 13:03.657
signed by 200 citizens
against the proposed landfill.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.619
Hank, I understand how you
and a fringe minority feel.

13:06.619 --> 13:11.999
But that quarry is a festering stinkhole
that the hobos use as a giant toilet.

13:11.999 --> 13:15.711
We're better off without it.
Let's turn trash into cash.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.963
Their slogan's better than our slogan.

13:18.047 --> 13:20.341
Let's put it to a vote. All in favor?

13:21.050 --> 13:25.012
Then it's settled. Draining of the quarry
will begin tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

13:25.012 --> 13:28.933
Dad, Dad, what are we going to do?

13:28.933 --> 13:32.478
Uh... Don't worry, son.
I'll think of something.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.151
I've got it.

13:39.235 --> 13:42.154
We create three new people, Hank Jones,

13:42.238 --> 13:44.782
Dale Smith, and Bill Manoogian.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.244
When they find our lettermen jackets
in the car,

13:48.244 --> 13:49.995
those guys take the heat.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.207
Now, we're going to need three dead guys.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.917
The Army might have some dead guys.

13:56.043 --> 13:59.922
Why couldn't it have been me and Boomhauer
that did something horrible to you guys?

13:59.922 --> 14:01.924
'Cause Boomhauer's a saint.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.095
Okay, I've got a plan
that might actually work.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.347
Dale, we're going to need your scuba gear.

14:08.347 --> 14:09.598
Why?

14:09.682 --> 14:13.769
Because they can't find Boomhauer's car
if it's not there.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.437
But it is there.

14:15.521 --> 14:18.858
Maybe we should use Dale's scuba gear
to pull the car out.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.111
Now that's a plan, Hank.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.164
Piece of cake. I found her
right between my old lawnmower,

14:34.248 --> 14:38.335
and what I'm fairly certain
is a genuine Egyptian sarcophagus.

14:38.419 --> 14:41.213
- Okay, Bill, crank her up.
- Yup.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.347
Damn it, Dale.

14:50.431 --> 14:55.978
Strange. Another frogman must
have switched the hook after I surfaced.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.855
But why?

15:09.074 --> 15:13.245
My God... look at Boomhauer's car.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.248
At least it won't be too hard
to chop it up and bury it.

15:16.332 --> 15:20.169
Look. Our old letterman jackets.

15:24.632 --> 15:28.427
You can still see
where Dale's says "Towel Manager."

15:28.427 --> 15:30.846
Dad.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.265
Oh, this is nice. Very nice.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.643
Now, you see what Hank is doing, Darren?

15:36.226 --> 15:39.897
He's blocking the draining equipment
with a pile of debris.

15:39.897 --> 15:43.943
He's fighting garbage with garbage.
Good work, Hank.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.569
That's my dad!

15:45.653 --> 15:48.197
Uh... yeah... thanks.

15:48.197 --> 15:51.784
Okay, everybody, let's go get our chains
and our bag lunches

15:51.784 --> 15:53.744
and meet back at Hank's barricade.

15:55.204 --> 15:58.791
Uh, I should see if my dad wants
the peanut butter and lentil sandwich

15:58.791 --> 16:00.918
or the soy eggs and soysage.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.629
What are we going to do, Hank?

16:03.629 --> 16:05.547
If there's a protest, there will be cops,

16:05.631 --> 16:07.883
and if there are cops,
they'll try to pin it on me.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.052
And since I did it, they will succeed.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.680
Oh, my God, you know
he'll take us down with him.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.433
- That does sound like me, Hank!
- Pull it together, guys.

16:16.517 --> 16:20.354
I haven't spent all this time
acting like an environmental nut job

16:20.354 --> 16:23.565
just so Boomhauer could find out
we dumped his car here.

16:28.153 --> 16:32.074
Mr. McKay, may I borrow
your cell phone, please?

16:32.074 --> 16:36.996
Yeah, uh, this is unincorporated Arlen.
There might be roaming charges.

16:36.996 --> 16:37.997
I'll pay them!

16:43.085 --> 16:46.338
<i>Yo.</i>
- Mr. Boomhauer, it's Bobby Hill.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.674
I found your car, "Sally."

16:49.008 --> 16:52.803
Yeah, I think you want to get down
to the quarry as fast as you can.

16:52.803 --> 16:58.767
Oh! Man, I gotta run, man. Need you get
move the ice cream truck, man.

17:01.603 --> 17:03.981
<i>♪ Kum-ba-ya ♪</i>

17:03.981 --> 17:06.942
<i>♪ Kum-ba-ya, my Lord ♪</i>

17:07.026 --> 17:09.069
<i>♪ Kum-ba-ya ♪</i>

17:09.153 --> 17:10.988
I can't hear you, Mr. Hill.

17:11.405 --> 17:13.282
Uh, yeah.

17:13.282 --> 17:16.368
Hey, you know,
with all that junk sitting here,

17:16.452 --> 17:20.247
the quarry already looks like a landfill.
Maybe I should straighten up a bit.

17:20.247 --> 17:23.959
Bill, Dale, help me push
that car into the bushes.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.085
Too late!

17:28.255 --> 17:32.801
Okay, everybody, link arms
and form a human chain of defiance!

17:47.357 --> 17:51.695
Hi. Uh, we have to get in here
to drain the quarry?

17:51.779 --> 17:55.157
Over our bloody and beaten bodies!

17:55.157 --> 17:59.495
Oh, oh, I see, well,
this is a protest. Okay, okay.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.498
I, I hadn't heard anything about it.
You know, new girl at the office.

18:02.498 --> 18:06.710
Still breaking her in. Okay, so, uh,
I guess I'll go call the cops?

18:09.630 --> 18:11.215
Oh, no!

18:12.216 --> 18:14.301
Boomhauer? What are you doing here?

18:20.974 --> 18:23.811
I can't believe, man... it's her, man!

18:23.811 --> 18:25.896
Dang ol', didn't think
I'd see you till heaven.

18:25.896 --> 18:30.484
Oh, man, like...
like closure, man, dat der...

18:31.276 --> 18:35.155
Boomhauer... there's something
you need to know.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.541
I'm sorry. It was a prank
that just got out of hand.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.252
Dang ol'... Hank.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.461
Dang, man.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.172
Oh, my God. It was... Hank?

18:52.756 --> 18:55.259
Boomhauer, did you find any other jackets

18:55.259 --> 18:58.053
which might prove
if Hank had any accomplices?

19:01.306 --> 19:06.019
No accomplices.
Hank committed this tragedy all alone.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.232
How could you, Hank?

19:10.232 --> 19:13.152
Man, I d-dang ol'
"Three Faces of Hank," man.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.070
You don't talk 'bout dat real...

19:15.154 --> 19:16.947
Thanks for the heads-up, Bobby.

19:17.739 --> 19:21.118
You called Boomhauer on me? But... why?

19:21.118 --> 19:26.790
You acted like an environmental nut job
for a week? But, why?

19:29.126 --> 19:32.754
Bobby, you've got to believe me,
I didn't mean for you to hear that.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.843
Oh, oh, oh, it's the cops. Wonderful!

19:37.843 --> 19:40.804
I've always wanted
to get arrested for my principles.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.222
Okay, everybody,

19:42.681 --> 19:44.600
dead weight.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.686
Please lie on your stomach
and spread your arms and legs.

19:47.686 --> 19:52.941
Me, too? But, but I'm not even
getting extra credit anymore.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.359
You heard me.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.862
This is crazy. You can't arrest him!

19:56.862 --> 20:01.074
He's just a misguided seventh grader
trying to save some pond scum.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.993
I'm the one who did something wrong.

20:02.993 --> 20:08.207
I've always been against stealing cars
and lying to my son.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.625
Now, I've done both.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.960
If anyone should be arrested, it's me.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.716
What do you say we go home, Bobby?

20:17.716 --> 20:20.802
Stop resisting. On your stomach.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.679
All right,
let's take him out of here.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.349
Let's go, pal.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.643
That's it, Dad! Dead weight!

20:27.643 --> 20:30.520
- Boomhauer!
- Yo, man.

20:41.240 --> 20:45.077
That's just great. Hank was our lift.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.663
Hey, if you're taking Bobby,
can you take us too?

20:47.663 --> 20:50.249
Man, I'll tell you what, man.
You dang ol' drove it here, man.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.418
Talkin' 'bout drive it back, man.
Dang ol' traitors, man.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.005
Ah, what gave us away?

21:10.185 --> 21:13.689
Come on...

21:14.273 --> 21:16.608
Come on...
You're flooding it.

21:19.528 --> 21:24.366
- Mr. Boomhauer, can I ask your advice?
- Yo.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.703
How long should we stay angry at my dad?

21:27.703 --> 21:31.415
Well, you know, Bobby, I tell you,
time don't take from me, man.

21:31.415 --> 21:34.376
You know, life's too short, man.
You don't want to hold no grudge, man.

21:34.376 --> 21:37.504
Talkin' 'bout let ol' bygones
be bygones, man.

21:39.047 --> 21:41.049
Maybe two weeks, probably three.

21:41.133 --> 21:45.971
You know, Mr. Boomhauer, I can see
why my dad is always quoting you.

21:45.971 --> 21:49.349
Man, your daddy quote me?
Gotdang, ol', man.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.102
Maybe just one week.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.847
<i>No, no. No.</i>

22:28.847 --> 22:30.015
<i>No.</i>
