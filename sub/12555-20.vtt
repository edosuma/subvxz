17:26.002 --> 17:27.585
WICKWIRE.

17:27.672 --> 17:28.833
WE'RE VERY
CONFUSED.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.292
WE NEED HELP.

17:30.383 --> 17:34.126
WELL, SIT DOWN,
MY BOYS, SIT DOWN.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.961
COME ON,
SIT DOWN.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.921
WHAT IS IT?

17:38.015 --> 17:39.301
NOW, YOU SAID

17:39.392 --> 17:41.724
THAT WE WERE
IN A CEMETERY.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.176
WHAT DID
YOU MEAN?

17:43.271 --> 17:44.682
JUST
EXACTLY THAT.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.683
BUT BEFORE
I EXPLAIN

17:46.774 --> 17:49.687
YOU MUST GIVE ME
SOME INFORMATION.

17:49.777 --> 17:53.486
IF YOU WERE GRANTED
YOUR DEAREST WISH

17:53.573 --> 17:55.655
WHAT WOULD
YOUR WISH BE?

17:55.741 --> 17:57.482
I'M NOT SURE I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.238
I MEAN, WHERE
WOULD YOU RATHER BE

17:59.328 --> 18:00.944
RIGHT NOW?

18:01.038 --> 18:04.702
I'D LIKE TO BE ON THE SHIP
HEADED FOR HOME.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.204
AND YOU, CAPTAIN.

18:07.295 --> 18:09.707
I'LL GO ALONG
WITH THAT.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.799
SPLENDID, AND JUST
ONE THING MORE.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.469
WHEN YOU LEFT EARTH,
WHAT WAS THE DATE?

18:18.556 --> 18:19.887
SEPTEMBER.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.806
NO, NO, THE YEAR.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.350
2185.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.771
2185?
[chuckles]

18:27.857 --> 18:29.564
NOW I UNDERSTAND.

18:29.650 --> 18:30.936
WELL, THAT'S NICE.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.233
WE DON'T!

18:32.320 --> 18:33.810
WHEN YOU ARRIVED

18:33.904 --> 18:36.032
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
FROM HAPPY GLADES.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.697
BUT BY YOUR BEHAVIOR

18:37.783 --> 18:39.569
<i>OF COURSE, I SEE
YOU COULDN'T BE.</i>

18:39.660 --> 18:41.321
WE'RE STILL
NOT FOLLOWING YOU.

18:41.412 --> 18:42.743
WHAT'S HAPPY GLADES?

18:42.830 --> 18:44.821
THE WORLD'S
GREATEST MORTUARY.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.498
AT LEAST, THAT'S
WHAT IT USED TO BE.

18:47.585 --> 18:50.623
YOU SEE, THE MANAGEMENT
HIT UPON THIS SCHEME

18:50.713 --> 18:53.626
AS A SERVICE TO THOSE
VVHO COULD AFFORD IT.

18:53.716 --> 18:55.081
"THIS SCHEME"
BEING?

18:55.176 --> 18:56.837
THIS LITTLE
ASTEROID

18:56.927 --> 19:00.261
WHERE WE WOULD RECREATE
THE EXACT CONDITIONS

19:00.348 --> 19:03.636
UNDER VVHICH THE DEAR
DEPARTED COULD BE MOST HAPPY.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.467
FOR AN EXAMPLE,

19:05.561 --> 19:08.724
IF THE DECEASED ALWAYS
WANTED TO BE ELECTED MAYOR

19:08.814 --> 19:10.771
HE WOULD ACHIEVE
HIS AMBITION HERE

19:10.858 --> 19:14.476
<i>FOR ALL ETERNITY.</i>

19:14.570 --> 19:16.857
YOU MEAN THOSE PEOPLE
ARE ALL DEAD?

19:16.947 --> 19:20.360
NO, NO, NOT ALL OF THEM.
JUST A SELECT FEW.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.567
THE OTHERS ARE IMITATIONS.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.370
<i>(Professor) IN OTHER
WORDS, THIS IS THE PLACE</i>

19:25.456 --> 19:28.869
VVHERE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE
AFTER YOU'VE STOPPED DREAMING.

19:28.959 --> 19:32.452
YES, THAT MIGHT BE ONE
VVAY OF PUTTING IT.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.378
YES, THAT'S
VERY GOOD.

19:34.465 --> 19:37.628
YOU EXPECT US TO BELIEVE
THAT EXPLANATION?

19:37.718 --> 19:40.096
I HADN'T THOUGHT OF THAT.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.386
DON'T YOU?

19:42.473 --> 19:45.181
IT'S TRUE, YOU KNOW.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.803
WELL, I'LL ADMIT

19:46.894 --> 19:50.137
WE HAVEN'T COME UP
WITH ANYTHING BETTER.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.602
BUT A CEMETERY
OUT IN SPACE.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.060
MILLIONS OF MILES
FROM EARTH.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.234
WHY?

19:57.321 --> 19:58.402
WHY?

19:58.489 --> 20:00.321
YES, WHY?

20:00.408 --> 20:03.275
NOVV, YOUR BOSS COULD HAVE
BOUGHT A PIECE OF DESERT.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.655
OH, NO, NO

20:04.745 --> 20:07.032
YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND AT ALL.

20:07.123 --> 20:10.161
HAPPY GLADES PROMISES
ETERNAL PEACE

20:10.251 --> 20:11.787
EVERLASTING PEACE.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.665
YOU COULDN'T
HAVE THAT ON EARTH

20:14.755 --> 20:17.463
NOW, COULD YOU?

20:17.550 --> 20:20.383
HE HAS A POINT.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.630
UH, WHAT
ABOUT YOU?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.303
ME?

20:23.389 --> 20:26.177
YES, YOU, HOVV DO YOU
FIGURE IN ALL THIS?

20:26.267 --> 20:28.759
WHY, I'M
THE CARETAKER.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.140
IT'S MY JOB
TO MAKE SURE

20:31.230 --> 20:33.938
THAT OUR GUESTS
ARE NOT,

20:34.024 --> 20:37.892
DISTURBED.

20:37.987 --> 20:43.983
VVELL, VVHEN DID THIS MORTUARY-
OR VVHATEVER IT IS- BEGIN?

20:44.076 --> 20:48.411
1973, I BELIEVE.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.909
YES, YES.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.741
THAT'D MAKE
YOU A BIT

20:52.835 --> 20:54.371
ON THE
ELDERLY SIDE

20:54.462 --> 20:56.829
WOULDN'T IT,
MR. WIREWICK?

20:56.922 --> 20:59.334
WICKWIRE.
[chuckles]

20:59.425 --> 21:01.211
NOW, I'M AFRAID
YOU'RE FORCING ME

21:01.302 --> 21:05.296
INTO A RATHER
EMBARRASSING ADMISSION.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.802
YOU SEE, I'M NOT
ACTUALLY HUMAN,

21:08.893 --> 21:10.975
<i>OH, IAM NOW</i>

21:11.061 --> 21:12.802
BUT WHEN YOU'VE GONE

21:12.897 --> 21:17.516
I SHALL GO BACK TO SLEEP
AGAIN UNTIL I'M NEEDED.

21:17.610 --> 21:22.355
YOU SEE, I'M-- I'M MERELY
A SCIENTIFIC DEVICE.

21:22.448 --> 21:26.191
I GO ON AND OFF AGAIN
LIKE A MACHINE.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.572
YOU UNDERSTAND.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.830
YES, IT'S NOT
VERY COMPLICATED

21:32.917 --> 21:34.032
IS IT, REALLY?

21:34.126 --> 21:35.958
HE GOES
ON AND OFF.

21:36.045 --> 21:40.835
YES, I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN
OFF FOR ABOUT 200 YEARS.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.791
LOOK, MISTER,
YOU THINK--

21:42.885 --> 21:46.253
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, PETE.

21:46.347 --> 21:48.304
MR. WICKWIRE

21:48.390 --> 21:50.518
WE'RE
STAYING HERE.

21:50.601 --> 21:53.844
YES, I KNOW.

21:53.938 --> 21:58.182
YES, BUT YOU
SAID SOMETHING

21:58.275 --> 22:01.563
ABOUT OUR
BEING GONE.

22:01.654 --> 22:05.272
OH, THAT'S A FIGURE
OF SPEECH, CAPTAIN.

22:05.366 --> 22:07.073
I MEANT "DEPARTED."

22:07.159 --> 22:10.277
"GONE ON" AS IT WERE.

22:10.371 --> 22:13.204
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT HE'S SAYING

22:13.290 --> 22:16.828
DON'T YOU?

22:16.919 --> 22:19.206
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO TRUST HIM.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.457
I TOLD YOU!

22:29.098 --> 22:30.884
WE MEANT YOU
NO HARM.

22:30.975 --> 22:34.843
I REALIZE THAT AND I'M SORRY.

22:34.937 --> 22:36.302
