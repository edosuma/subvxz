00:22.732 --> 00:23.733
7 YEARS AGO

01:55.699 --> 01:59.036
Caco, for Christ's sake,
you've never sung well.

01:59.245 --> 02:00.538
You've always liked it.

02:00.830 --> 02:03.082
Look, the worst thing about a bad singer

02:03.207 --> 02:05.626
is thinking they can sing.
They have bad ears.

02:06.335 --> 02:09.672
Thanks for the morning pep talk, Camila.

02:10.923 --> 02:13.592
If you need honesty, you count on me.

02:14.218 --> 02:15.553
I've made your tapioca.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.762
Thank you.

02:20.975 --> 02:22.017
Want a banana?

02:23.853 --> 02:26.188
Camila, is that carpaccio thing

02:26.272 --> 02:27.314
a childhood trauma?

02:27.398 --> 02:29.024
Yeah, now it's your turn.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.067
Take it.

02:30.568 --> 02:35.281
You guys are great.
You love to eat sliced cheese, right?

02:36.073 --> 02:36.991
Come on, Joana,

02:37.074 --> 02:38.075
I need to work.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.037
Have a great one.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.205
You, too.

02:43.414 --> 02:45.416
I left a mango in the fridge,

02:45.791 --> 02:47.710
sliced into normal pieces, okay?

02:58.220 --> 02:59.221
Is everything okay?

03:03.726 --> 03:05.185
Do you agree with Camila?

03:06.061 --> 03:06.896
About what?

03:06.979 --> 03:08.105
Am I a bad singer?

03:08.856 --> 03:11.817
-Of course. Take it easy, let me talk.
-You agree.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.652
Of course not.

03:13.986 --> 03:15.571
Your gift is unquestionable.

03:16.447 --> 03:19.825
Look, I know an amazing band.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.036
They want a new guitar player.

03:22.119 --> 03:22.953
Really?

03:23.871 --> 03:24.788
Interested?

03:25.331 --> 03:27.791
Of course I am. Of course, Joana.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.168
You're great.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.547
Praise the Lord.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.927
Jeez, what a gorgeous man.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.011
I told you.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.721
Be careful, Camila.

03:40.971 --> 03:44.099
The key to seeing a gorgeous man
is making him think he's ugly,

03:44.266 --> 03:46.060
and beauty isn't important to you.

03:46.310 --> 03:47.728
Come again?

03:47.811 --> 03:48.646
Yeah, Conga.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.648
His self-esteem is up here.

03:51.190 --> 03:52.983
And yours is down here,

03:53.192 --> 03:54.652
so you gotta lower his.

03:54.777 --> 03:56.612
And who'll boost mine after this?

03:58.822 --> 04:01.784
The important thing
is making him totally insecure.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.786
Focus on flaws.

04:04.203 --> 04:05.454
You're evil.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.789
I'm pragmatic.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.089
Hi.

04:15.839 --> 04:16.882
Thanks.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.517
I came here to tell you something.

04:27.518 --> 04:28.435
Tell me.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.562
You're gorgeous, this is not happening.

04:31.105 --> 04:34.108
I can't do this right now,
at this point of my life.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.652
You barely got here and you're leaving?

04:37.194 --> 04:40.823
I can't even go to the bathroom.
Women look at men like you.

04:43.033 --> 04:45.119
I don't see any women looking at me.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.002
Please,

04:53.293 --> 04:56.171
at least tell me you have debts,

04:56.255 --> 04:58.007
are unemployed and have no house.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.258
No, I...

05:00.134 --> 05:03.053
I work in the hotel sector,
I'm an investor.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.638
Right.

05:05.139 --> 05:06.265
A hotel owner.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.019
This is so not gonna happen.

05:10.728 --> 05:14.565
Look, this is the best hot dog
in the whole city, okay?

05:14.898 --> 05:15.774
The best.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.322
Let's sum it up.

05:24.450 --> 05:27.661
You'll get me into bed
with all this charm of yours.

05:27.745 --> 05:32.416
I'll wait for a call that won't happen,
I'll get nervous and eat a lot.

05:32.791 --> 05:33.667
That's really...

05:34.668 --> 05:36.086
This hot dog is really good.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.173
I'll find a reason

05:39.256 --> 05:40.549
to go to the gym

05:40.883 --> 05:42.634
and I'll see you with another girl.

05:43.302 --> 05:44.344
What for?

05:44.845 --> 05:46.555
Why do I have to go through this?

05:47.931 --> 05:48.849
What's this?

05:54.438 --> 05:55.272
Take it.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.528
Let's spare your time

06:01.779 --> 06:03.906
and my mental health and end this already.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.533
Do you know why?

06:07.493 --> 06:08.869
Gorgeous men are a handful.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.204
I'm gorgeous?

06:11.622 --> 06:12.581
Thanks.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.340
This way I'll have to kiss you.

06:22.841 --> 06:23.675
No, you won't,

06:23.967 --> 06:26.136
because this is really not gonna happen.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.109
Come on.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.111
Let me drop you at home.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.196
There's no need.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.615
I thought that was the restaurant.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.827
I parked far away not to pay the valet.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.455
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

06:57.793 --> 06:58.752
I'll call you.

06:59.336 --> 07:02.214
There's no need.
I told you, this ends here.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.814
Hey, sir! Hi.

07:19.648 --> 07:20.482
Sir.

07:20.566 --> 07:22.025
Hey!

07:34.246 --> 07:35.080
Hi.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.333
Something terrible just happened.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.711
Can you pick me up?

07:46.008 --> 07:47.843
Why doesn't anything ever work out?

07:52.389 --> 07:54.725
I'm working hard to pay off my part.

07:56.310 --> 07:59.313
Now the My New Fabulous car was towed.

08:01.356 --> 08:05.194
I know that saying about
blessings in disguise is hokey,

08:05.319 --> 08:07.446
but, I don't know,

08:07.988 --> 08:11.992
sometimes we gotta think
the hardships show us the right path.

08:13.327 --> 08:16.872
I see it clearly now, with everything
I've been through with Petrosil.

08:16.955 --> 08:20.375
That gave me the strength
to go after my teenage dream,

08:20.459 --> 08:21.835
which is being a musician.

08:23.712 --> 08:24.671
What, Caco?

08:26.215 --> 08:27.382
A musician?

08:27.466 --> 08:28.383
Pull over.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.052
Pull over!

08:35.224 --> 08:37.559
Go back to work, I'd rather walk.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.993
Hi, how are you?

08:55.160 --> 08:56.536
<i>Didn't I tell you I'd call?</i>

08:57.329 --> 08:58.455
Did I forget anything?

08:58.705 --> 09:00.832
I'm kinda busy right now.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.919
<i>No, I'm calling you</i>
<i>so you don't get nervous</i>

09:04.002 --> 09:07.923
<i>and eat a lot and go to the gym</i>
<i>and see me with another girl.</i>

09:08.048 --> 09:10.259
<i>I'd like to have lunch with you tomorrow.</i>

09:10.342 --> 09:11.635
Thank God.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.636
<i>Really?</i>

09:12.719 --> 09:13.595
<i>When?</i>

09:13.679 --> 09:15.806
No, it was something else.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.307
I can't tomorrow.

09:17.599 --> 09:20.852
I have an important My New Fabulous event
at Rio Convention.

09:21.353 --> 09:22.646
Right.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.815
How about after? When does it end?

09:26.149 --> 09:29.528
Around 5:00 p.m.,
but I really can't tomorrow.

09:29.945 --> 09:32.614
Camila, it looks like
you're turning me down.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.199
I'm doing you a favor.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.410
Look, my life is a mess,

09:36.493 --> 09:38.954
my car was towed, I can't fit you in.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.331
Move on, everything's gonna be fine...

09:41.790 --> 09:43.041
A friend is calling me.

09:43.417 --> 09:45.127
Okay? We'll talk later, bye.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.169
Bye.

09:46.378 --> 09:49.089
-Hi, Pat.
<i>-Hi, where's the gorgeous guy?</i>

09:49.172 --> 09:51.091
No, I've already dumped him.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.970
-I don't have time to do this right now.
-What?

09:55.095 --> 09:58.348
I can't believe it, Conga.
You broke up with that gorgeous guy.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.694
Joana, baby. I'm here.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.235
Caco,

10:52.861 --> 10:53.695
are you there?

11:01.036 --> 11:02.079
I'm coming, baby.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.378
Go!

11:09.669 --> 11:11.963
<i>She started from scratch</i>
<i>and in record time</i>

11:12.047 --> 11:14.841
managed to lead sales in Rio de Janeiro,

11:14.925 --> 11:17.636
empowering hundreds of rookies

11:17.719 --> 11:20.180
to achieve financial independence.

11:20.722 --> 11:22.349
She was the first carioca

11:22.432 --> 11:25.143
to be rewarded for her hard work

11:25.227 --> 11:27.104
with our company's highest honor,

11:27.604 --> 11:31.817
the My New Fabulous car.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.569
Camila Silva!

11:34.820 --> 11:35.904
Please...

11:40.075 --> 11:41.243
Beautiful!

11:43.912 --> 11:46.623
Good afternoon, my dear fabulous.

11:46.748 --> 11:51.503
You know our products sell more
because they're better.

11:51.837 --> 11:55.549
Imagine expanding
into a highly profitable market.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.592
It's a great honor to present to you

11:57.717 --> 12:02.931
the My New Fabulous new unisex line.

12:06.351 --> 12:09.980
<i>My New Fabulous</i>

12:13.650 --> 12:16.153
<i>When it touches your skin</i>

12:18.405 --> 12:20.907
<i>Summer all year long</i>

12:23.285 --> 12:25.704
<i>Refresh your peachy skin</i>

12:28.248 --> 12:31.877
A treatment you can make at home
for a very affordable price.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.463
<i>You, too, can be part of this family.</i>

12:40.218 --> 12:41.178
Now,

12:41.303 --> 12:45.390
I'd like to know who wants
to be the first volunteer to try

12:45.474 --> 12:48.560
the My New Fabulous new collagen device.

12:50.228 --> 12:51.062
Me!

12:51.938 --> 12:52.772
Me!

12:53.064 --> 12:54.774
Guys, what's this? Jeez!

12:55.442 --> 13:00.197
You see, girls?
Men care more and more about skincare.

13:01.072 --> 13:05.494
If My New Fabulous sent me him
instead of a car, I won't mind.

13:10.123 --> 13:10.957
Well...

13:11.458 --> 13:13.418
I'm gonna apply

13:13.502 --> 13:17.506
only on the right side of his face
so you can see the difference.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.591
The effects begin within five minutes.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.968
Put some on his abs already!

13:22.219 --> 13:24.429
Why so little?

13:24.763 --> 13:25.680
Do I take it off?

13:25.764 --> 13:26.806
There's no need.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.393
-Like this?
-Girls.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.354
Have you seen Helen around?

13:32.812 --> 13:33.730
She's gone.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.440
-A while ago.
-She bounced.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.067
Really?

13:39.778 --> 13:42.197
Look, I guess I'm gonna need you

13:42.280 --> 13:47.744
to apply this product on me again. Only
the right side of my face looks young.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.789
-Bad joke, right?
-Silly.

13:50.872 --> 13:51.706
Okay, look.

13:52.082 --> 13:53.166
Let's have dinner.

13:53.291 --> 13:54.125
Shall we?

13:54.209 --> 13:56.503
I'm not that lucky.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.964
If I were you, I'd skip to dessert.

14:02.092 --> 14:02.926
Okay.

14:03.218 --> 14:06.638
But, look, I'm not sure
if I made myself clear last time.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.015
Nothing's gonna happen.

14:09.641 --> 14:10.809
Okay?

14:14.312 --> 14:15.480
Look...

14:15.564 --> 14:16.940
This ends here, okay?

14:22.529 --> 14:24.072
Just to frighten you away,

14:24.155 --> 14:26.116
I have a lot of problems.

14:26.324 --> 14:28.952
I'm about to lose my place
and I have bad credit.

14:29.661 --> 14:30.745
I snore, okay?

14:31.121 --> 14:32.998
I can't stand myself during PMS

14:33.206 --> 14:35.875
and I have daddy issues confirmed
by a shrink.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.460
I still live with my ex.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.088
Wait, what do you mean?

14:41.006 --> 14:42.382
You two sleep together?

14:42.716 --> 14:44.801
No, different bedrooms.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.599
Is there anything between you two?

14:51.558 --> 14:52.642
God forbid.

14:53.184 --> 14:56.396
Caco's broke,
and I can't afford to live by myself now.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.277
If there's nothing between you,
introduce me to him.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.117
How did you become a famous actor?

15:09.451 --> 15:11.453
At first, it's hard, of course.

15:11.578 --> 15:14.164
Things don't work out,
it takes time to get going,

15:14.331 --> 15:17.834
but I persevered because I believed

15:18.418 --> 15:20.754
at one point my work would be recognized.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.297
And it was.

15:23.131 --> 15:25.216
I think our talk here is a divine sign.

15:25.342 --> 15:27.052
My teenage dream

15:27.135 --> 15:30.930
was being a musician, being in a band,
and now you're in my car.

15:31.181 --> 15:33.224
Nothing happens by chance.

15:35.060 --> 15:35.935
Camila!

15:37.270 --> 15:40.774
Camila, you won't believe
who got in my car today. Camila...

15:41.024 --> 15:43.234
You won't believe whom I've just met.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.030
Camila!

15:56.915 --> 15:58.291
Camila is taking a shower.

16:06.049 --> 16:06.883
Caco?

16:09.928 --> 16:10.845
Roberto Carlos.

16:12.931 --> 16:13.765
Caco.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.476
No, Roberto Carlos.

16:17.852 --> 16:18.687
Caco.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.293
You've already met.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.505
Roberto Carlos singing Roberto's songs.

16:45.588 --> 16:46.840
I'll get emotional.

16:46.923 --> 16:50.218
How can I have the king's name
and not know how to reign?

16:50.677 --> 16:52.262
Listen, she messes with me

16:52.554 --> 16:55.181
because I watch
the king's Christmas concert.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.725
-You're kidding.
-No.

16:56.808 --> 16:57.892
-You're kidding.
-No.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.310
-You're kidding.
-No.

16:59.394 --> 17:00.687
You're kidding, Caco.

17:00.854 --> 17:02.522
Camila, for Christ's sake,

17:02.605 --> 17:03.440
look,

17:03.565 --> 17:06.484
this king's Christmas concert
is a tradition.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.319
I got it.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.665
So... Can we go?

17:20.832 --> 17:23.251
It's hard to find a parking spot
at the movies.

17:25.003 --> 17:25.837
Yeah?

17:26.171 --> 17:27.005
Yeah.

17:27.088 --> 17:28.590
We can go later

17:28.673 --> 17:31.593
and catch the next screening
so we don't have to hurry.

17:32.177 --> 17:33.636
Stay with us a little longer.

17:34.804 --> 17:37.557
-From the chorus.
-From the chorus? Let's do this.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.654
Go!

18:33.446 --> 18:34.447
There you go!

18:43.039 --> 18:44.916
It's not what you're thinking.

18:53.007 --> 18:55.218
Guys, stop it!

18:55.760 --> 18:57.595
Caco, let's celebrate. Come on!

19:07.188 --> 19:09.649
I was finally able to pay the fines.

19:10.525 --> 19:11.901
So you got your car back?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.487
No, Caco, the tax wasn't paid yet.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.531
It means that, if you don't pay it,

19:16.948 --> 19:19.409
we get rid of the panties blue for good?

19:20.743 --> 19:22.370
You're kidding.

19:22.453 --> 19:23.746
Can I talk to you?

19:32.839 --> 19:33.798
I'm coming.

19:56.070 --> 19:57.655
Camila, where's Roberto?

19:59.282 --> 20:00.783
I don't know.

20:04.037 --> 20:05.955
Did you fight over the car?

20:07.248 --> 20:08.458
Don't tell me...

20:09.083 --> 20:10.209
-you...
-I broke up.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.129
How could you do something so stupid?

20:13.588 --> 20:14.964
He's a nice guy,

20:15.089 --> 20:16.799
rich, a very good singer,

20:17.550 --> 20:18.426
handsome...

20:18.760 --> 20:20.845
-You'll end...
-Leave me alone.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.182
You'll end up alone this way.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.571
How will I perform to the band now?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.658
I needed to rehearse with Roberto.

20:42.575 --> 20:44.827
Go find a therapist, Caco!

20:50.875 --> 20:51.751
Hey.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.879
-I'm here for the band audition.
-What's your name?

20:54.963 --> 20:55.922
I'm Caco.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.715
Joana told me about you guys.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.759
Nice to meet you, I'm the singer.

21:00.009 --> 21:02.345
-This is Dani, the bass player.
-Hi.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.513
On the drums, Leo.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.973
What's up, Leo?

21:05.056 --> 21:06.099
Joana's your fan.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.141
Joana is...

21:08.309 --> 21:11.354
I'd like to thank you.
I always wanted to be in a band.

21:11.729 --> 21:12.563
So...

21:12.647 --> 21:13.898
This is not any band.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.692
This band has a mission,

21:15.858 --> 21:17.443
to touch people's hearts.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.821
That's cool.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.531
Shall we? Follow us.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.282
-It's easy.
-Let's go.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.626
<i>The day</i>

21:34.168 --> 21:36.462
<i>You'll come back</i>

21:37.088 --> 21:40.049
<i>Come back into my hands</i>

21:40.550 --> 21:42.176
<i>Glory, my brother</i>

21:42.260 --> 21:45.430
<i>Jesus will save us</i>

21:45.555 --> 21:47.223
<i>The day</i>

21:47.640 --> 21:50.018
<i>You come back</i>

21:50.435 --> 21:53.896
<i>Come back into my hands</i>

21:54.313 --> 21:55.690
<i>Glory, my brother...</i>

21:55.815 --> 21:57.567
I couldn't stay with Joana.

21:57.859 --> 22:00.236
She's into gospel, I'm into rock 'n' roll.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.572
Why should I pretend?

22:02.697 --> 22:04.407
It's hard to give up on a dream.

22:04.615 --> 22:06.826
My career ended without even starting.

22:06.909 --> 22:09.245
Dreams don't pay bills.

22:09.454 --> 22:11.914
Do you know who can follow dreams? Heirs.

22:12.415 --> 22:16.377
Do you think I dream of wearing a suit
in Rio de Janeiro's weather?

22:18.421 --> 22:19.797
If you're interested,

22:20.339 --> 22:21.466
here's my card.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.343
You have a good background,

22:24.427 --> 22:25.928
you're very well prepared.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.013
Who knows?

22:27.472 --> 22:28.639
You can work with us.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.312
That's Caco. Isn't it?

22:35.855 --> 22:37.148
Caco.

22:38.399 --> 22:39.817
I was going to get off here.

22:52.538 --> 22:53.372
Caco.

22:53.581 --> 22:54.582
Where's Joana?

22:54.874 --> 22:58.002
He'd rather break up with her
than joining the church's band.

22:58.127 --> 22:59.170
Really, Caco?

22:59.629 --> 23:01.589
An amazing woman like Joana.

23:01.798 --> 23:04.509
You break up with her
over a silly prejudice?

23:04.592 --> 23:06.177
You'll end up alone that way.

23:06.427 --> 23:08.888
Camila, go find a therapist.

23:09.931 --> 23:11.265
Do you really think...

23:13.184 --> 23:14.018
Hey.

24:19.083 --> 24:20.042
I'm sorry, baby.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.086
Blue's my favorite color.

24:23.796 --> 24:24.630
Camila...

24:26.799 --> 24:27.884
Will you marry me?
