00:38.140 --> 00:40.950
Whoa! Would you look at that.

00:40.950 --> 00:42.780
It's amazing.

00:42.780 --> 00:45.640
I've never seen anything like
it Mr. President.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.500
Me neither.

00:50.570 --> 00:53.040
Here we go Mr. President.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.820
Mr. President.

00:58.740 --> 01:01.680
Sophie is ready for you haircut sir.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.830
Well you can tell her unless
she's planning for my

01:03.830 --> 01:06.510
assassination, it's not a good
time right now.

01:06.510 --> 01:08.460
Why don't we wait till we're on
the ground.

01:08.460 --> 01:11.520
We can always get that together
before the photo ops.

01:11.520 --> 01:12.640
Yeah yeah yeah.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.030
I'll let her know Mr. President.

01:14.030 --> 01:16.950
Besides, I kinda like a little long.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.730
Reminds me of my blue collar days.

01:21.410 --> 01:22.880
Geez.

01:24.210 --> 01:25.580
Mr. Green.
-Yeah.

01:25.580 --> 01:27.670
Can you ask the pilots if they
can take us above this please?

01:27.670 --> 01:29.660
I'll go speak with the crew.

01:35.550 --> 01:36.710
Are you ok sir?

01:36.710 --> 01:38.920
Yeah, uh...
I got a little headache.

01:38.920 --> 01:40.770
I have some ibuprofen sir.

01:40.770 --> 01:42.160
Good idea.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.640
Green, what's going on up there?

01:48.640 --> 01:50.050
Get the pilots to level the
plane.

01:50.050 --> 01:52.810
I think it's about time we get up front
and get strapped in Mr. President.

01:52.810 --> 01:56.870
Thank you. We are flying over
the Bermuda Triangle after all.

02:04.770 --> 02:07.210
We need to evacuate now Mr. President!

02:07.210 --> 02:09.240
Get him out of here!

02:10.050 --> 02:12.120
Let's get him out!

02:18.740 --> 02:20.540
Hold on to him!

02:22.050 --> 02:24.130
Alright! Go! Clear!

02:24.830 --> 02:26.470
Alright go ahead!

02:28.500 --> 02:29.760
Mr. President.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.870
The pod is equipped with atmospheric
and pressurization controls,

02:32.870 --> 02:34.220
As well as oxygen recyclers.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.400
So you have plenty of air to breathe.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.090
The maximum crush
depth is 20,000 feet.

02:39.090 --> 02:42.010
You'll have enough food and
water to last you for 7 days.

02:42.010 --> 02:45.470
There is also a deep water satcom
transmitter that only we can pick up,

02:45.470 --> 02:48.420
So we will be monitoring you
every second of the way.

02:48.420 --> 02:52.150
And you've got a 40 caliber pistol
with 100 rounds of ammunition.

02:52.150 --> 02:53.080
Good Luck Sir.

02:53.080 --> 02:55.110
We've sent an encrypted message
to the White House Sir.

02:55.110 --> 02:58.680
Vice President MacKenzie has
been notified! Good Luck Sir.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.930
Alright! Try to save yourselves men!

03:00.930 --> 03:02.280
Close the pod.

03:02.280 --> 03:03.420
Stand back Stand back!

03:03.420 --> 03:04.350
Don't close the pod!

03:04.350 --> 03:05.700
God bless you!

04:08.360 --> 04:10.940
We'll refuel and will you
find out what's going on?

04:10.940 --> 04:13.810
Yes sir! And hopefully this
won't take too long.

04:17.540 --> 04:20.170
Good morning sergeant Oliver.
Soldiers.

04:20.170 --> 04:21.850
Good to see you again sir.

04:21.850 --> 04:23.440
We have a situation.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.640
Will you and your second
accompany me to the bridge?

04:25.640 --> 04:26.950
Of course sir.

04:28.090 --> 04:30.590
You guys hang loose until I
find out what's going on.

05:00.560 --> 05:04.380
Yes sir, we are in the process of
locating that signal as we speak.

05:06.680 --> 05:10.030
Captain Oliver and team are
reporting for duty Admiral.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.090
At ease.

05:12.090 --> 05:13.790
Chairman Leary.

05:13.790 --> 05:16.400
Chief Oliver is present as you
requested.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.240
Good morning Chief Oliver.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.590
Good morning Chairman.

05:19.590 --> 05:23.220
I know you've been gone on a
long rotation, and

05:23.220 --> 05:26.530
you and your men are certainly
in need of a break.

05:26.530 --> 05:31.070
But, we have a situation of the
utmost urgency,

05:31.070 --> 05:33.560
and we need your assistance.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.490
Yes, sir. Whatever you need sir.

05:35.490 --> 05:37.480
The President of United State

05:37.480 --> 05:43.490
was jettisoned from Air Force One in his
escape pod at 0517 hours this morning.

05:44.380 --> 05:47.800
You and your team willcoordinate
with Admiral Hanson,

05:47.800 --> 05:49.720
and CPO Vincent.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.880
You will rescue the president.

05:51.880 --> 05:56.090
I'll call Hurlburt personally, and
inform them of your new orders.

05:56.380 --> 05:57.660
Yes, Sir.

05:57.660 --> 06:00.440
Bring the President back alive, son.

06:01.020 --> 06:02.660
Yes sir.

06:06.590 --> 06:09.540
Nice to be working with you again Admiral.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.340
Chief Oliver.

06:11.570 --> 06:15.300
You were asked to run this
operation by the JCS, not by me.

06:15.300 --> 06:19.220
So please take not that this is
still my operation.

06:19.550 --> 06:21.790
I know that you are a risk taker.

06:21.790 --> 06:26.635
And risk taking often ends up
with unnecessary loss of life,

06:26.661 --> 06:28.855
as you and I both know.

06:29.250 --> 06:33.410
There will be no risk taken
onthis mission without my orders.

06:33.410 --> 06:36.900
This is the President of the United States.

06:36.900 --> 06:39.440
You will follow my orders to the
letter.

06:39.440 --> 06:43.300
Failure to do so, will result in
your immediate court martial.

06:43.300 --> 06:45.700
Do we understand each other?

06:46.010 --> 06:48.130
Yes Admiral.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.350
Captain Phillips.

06:50.350 --> 06:54.020
Have Dr. Zimmer and Lieutenant Plummer
meet us on the deck, Immediately.

06:54.020 --> 06:54.970
Yes Admiral.

06:54.970 --> 06:59.740
Chief Oliver. Assemble your team,
and meet us on the deck as well.

06:59.740 --> 07:02.080
Yes Admiral Hanson.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.170
Dismissed.

07:04.750 --> 07:07.010
Your team is still prepped and
ready to go?

07:07.010 --> 07:07.860
Yes Admiral.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.270
Very good.

07:26.310 --> 07:27.710
Hey Rivas.

07:28.010 --> 07:29.250
What's up?

07:34.180 --> 07:35.650
What is it?

07:36.340 --> 07:37.660
No clue.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.150
Boy she still has it in for you huh?

07:42.160 --> 07:44.190
Yeah well the feeling is mutual.

07:44.190 --> 07:45.520
Just glad we got the call.

07:45.530 --> 07:50.260
You'll be fine.
Hey, It's only the President.

07:56.970 --> 07:58.740
All units to general quarters, this is not

07:58.740 --> 08:01.110
a drill, all units to
general quarters.

08:01.620 --> 08:02.820
Bridge! Report!

08:03.240 --> 08:04.500
Bridge!

08:06.970 --> 08:09.680
We're under attack, it's
some kind of...

08:15.070 --> 08:17.020
Get to your team.

08:25.030 --> 08:26.470
Come on. Let's go.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.200
I've never seen nothing...

08:51.200 --> 08:53.130
Whoa! Careful Doctor.

08:54.780 --> 08:56.770
What the hell are those?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.820
Riftia pachyptila.

08:58.820 --> 09:01.730
But of course they very
extravagant embodiment.

09:01.730 --> 09:03.960
Non scientific name please, Doctor.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.790
Tubeworms, Admiral.

09:05.790 --> 09:10.890
But they seem to possess some sort of
bioelectrogenesis, which is contrary

09:10.890 --> 09:14.800
to any species in its
respective phylum...

09:14.800 --> 09:17.640
They would appear to be
surveying us at the moment.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.570
Tell me about.

09:23.510 --> 09:25.950
Do they seem hostile?

09:26.310 --> 09:29.020
I don't know, they're worms.

09:31.090 --> 09:33.640
But they do seem angry.

09:35.220 --> 09:37.640
All teams lock and load.

09:37.640 --> 09:40.190
Woman: Chief, you seeing this?

09:40.190 --> 09:41.980
Confirmative Rivas.

09:41.980 --> 09:44.590
Lock and load and get the team
port side.

09:44.690 --> 09:48.360
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
-That's what I'm talking about.

10:01.930 --> 10:04.130
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

10:04.130 --> 10:06.890
It does not look good.

10:06.890 --> 10:09.310
Nice and ease.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.020
The second that thing makes a move,

10:21.020 --> 10:23.490
I'll blast his ugly ass to hell.

10:41.040 --> 10:41.810
ENGAGE!

10:41.810 --> 10:43.070
ALL ENGAGE! ALL ENGAGE!

10:43.070 --> 10:44.710
Engage! Engage!

10:50.180 --> 10:52.940
Go go go go go.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.170
Free Fire Zone!

11:12.260 --> 11:18.100
We are cleared hot for Tangos!
We are cleared hot for Tangos!

11:30.620 --> 11:33.110
None of the artillery or SAMsare
having any effect, Admiral.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.470
Suggestions?

11:34.470 --> 11:35.880
Zimmer?

11:59.280 --> 12:01.170
We need air support now!

12:01.170 --> 12:02.950
Get us airborne.

12:26.870 --> 12:29.170
What are those things?

12:29.170 --> 12:30.790
I don't know Rivas.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.460
Preacher, Lay down some coverwhile
I'll I get into position.

12:53.460 --> 12:54.970
You gotta keep that thing busy.

12:54.970 --> 12:56.650
Alright Hondo.

13:05.290 --> 13:07.910
NOW! The one in the middle is wounded.
12 o'clock.

13:07.910 --> 13:09.000
Roger that.

13:09.000 --> 13:12.340
Concentrate fire on the
wounded ones, 12 o'clock!

13:14.060 --> 13:16.320
Bring the 8-4.

13:22.140 --> 13:24.200
Suck on this.

13:37.340 --> 13:41.000
Captain Phillips. Commencedamage control.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.950
Weapons systems are our first priority.

13:43.950 --> 13:47.100
I want to keep some aircraft up there.

13:47.100 --> 13:51.410
Get the tankers airborne to
refuel and recall the rest.

13:51.990 --> 13:57.900
Dr. Zimmer. I want a completeassessment
of what those things were.

14:04.820 --> 14:07.220
Attention on deck.

14:07.660 --> 14:09.210
At ease.

14:09.210 --> 14:12.670
Chief Oliver you still have a
job to do.

14:12.820 --> 14:14.190
CPO Vincent.

14:14.190 --> 14:17.250
We've established an approximate
location of the President's pod.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.600
At 7,000 meters deep.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.480
Now that's beyond the
maximum crush capacity.

14:22.480 --> 14:26.390
The structure of the hull
seems to be fully intact.

14:26.390 --> 14:29.500
Butthere me a compromise in
the oxygen recycler.

14:29.500 --> 14:34.390
We estimate that there may be as little
as 4 hours of oxygen remaining.

14:34.390 --> 14:39.180
Now it's gonna take you 3 hoursto safely
descend to that depth in the diving bell.

14:39.180 --> 14:43.680
Upon your arrival, you'll deploy with
the fluorocarbon liquid ventilators.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.980
You don't have much time gentlemen.

14:45.980 --> 14:50.120
So if you're not up to task, I
expect you to be forthcoming now.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.380
We can handle it.

14:52.710 --> 14:54.250
Admiral Hanson?

14:54.250 --> 14:55.760
Yes Lt. Plummer?

14:55.760 --> 14:59.930
Perhaps we should use
the Prometheus DSRV2 prototype.

15:02.480 --> 15:06.600
Forgive me. This is Lieutenant Plummerl
from the Office of Nava Research.

15:06.600 --> 15:11.370
She's an expert on physical oceanography
and marine electronics engineering.

15:11.370 --> 15:14.190
She will also yourmission advisor.

15:16.050 --> 15:18.850
Can you tell us a little more
about the Prometheus, Lieutenant?

15:18.850 --> 15:21.690
It's a prototype deep sea
piloted submersible that was

15:21.690 --> 15:24.840
set to be free cleared for
duty this month.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.510
Now, it would take a quarter of
that time to reach that depth.

15:28.510 --> 15:31.930
And give these circumstances,
we should consider it.

15:31.930 --> 15:36.050
But it's also not equipped with
any type of armament.

15:36.050 --> 15:41.300
CPO Vincent, when are your Sub Surface
Assault Vessels scheduled to arrive?

15:41.300 --> 15:42.640
Within the hour,

15:42.640 --> 15:46.410
And then another 30 minutes to
prep and deploy, Admiral.

15:46.410 --> 15:48.490
Alright. Let's do it.

15:48.720 --> 15:53.790
Lt. Plummer, tell the Prometheus crew
to prep and diagnostics, immediately.

15:53.790 --> 15:55.330
Yes Admiral.

15:55.330 --> 15:56.530
Chief Oliver.

15:56.530 --> 16:00.260
When the SSAV's arrive to
provide escort, you will launch.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.120
With all do respect Admiral, I
don't think we have time for that.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.230
We don't know when these thing
will strike again.

16:05.230 --> 16:06.270
Duly noted.

16:06.270 --> 16:08.090
And I appreciate your concern.

16:08.090 --> 16:11.410
But without a security escort,
the mission is jeopardizes

16:11.410 --> 16:15.580
and more importantly so is
President's life. We will wait.

16:15.820 --> 16:19.870
We'll be standing by, awaiting
your orders Admiral Hanson.

16:20.050 --> 16:22.560
Very well. Dismissed.

16:22.750 --> 16:26.080
CPO Vincent. Dr. Zimmer. Come
with me. I want to know what the

16:26.080 --> 16:28.880
hell it was that attacked
my fleet.

16:29.570 --> 16:32.650
Alright gear up.
We've got a job to do.

17:20.490 --> 17:22.480
How much time is left?

17:22.480 --> 17:23.680
Over 3 hours.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.660
This is ridiculous we got to
wait for Vincent's equipment.

17:26.730 --> 17:28.610
Admiral's got a point though.

17:28.610 --> 17:31.600
Those things attack us
down there, we're screwed.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.560
It is highly maneuverable.

17:35.490 --> 17:37.400
Ok. Ah ten hut!

17:37.590 --> 17:39.140
At ease!

17:39.140 --> 17:40.920
Soldier!

17:41.190 --> 17:43.910
I am commander Lt. Jude Barclay.

17:43.910 --> 17:46.540
I'll be piloting the Prometheus.

17:46.830 --> 17:49.280
Means through your gear aboard now!

17:49.550 --> 17:51.330
Thank you sir.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.710
Alright you heard him!

17:54.710 --> 17:56.840
Grab your gear and load up.

18:05.570 --> 18:07.990
We being attacked again?

18:14.000 --> 18:20.470
I need gunnery teams to coordinate, choose
one organism and concentrate their fire--

18:20.470 --> 18:22.310
On that one only.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.870
Same with air assets.

18:23.870 --> 18:28.570
Flight helicopters, Fixed wing. Pick one.
Kill it and move on to the next!

18:28.570 --> 18:30.150
I. I.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.750
Alright, that's it.
Everybody listen up.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.050
I'm through screwing around down here.
I'm taking that sub out right now.

18:45.050 --> 18:47.100
We will not be able to defend
ourselves down there.

18:47.100 --> 18:49.940
Vincent will never get his equipment
aboard with those thing attacking us.

18:49.940 --> 18:52.220
And we're just gonna loose more
time.

18:52.220 --> 18:53.420
You wanna come?

18:53.420 --> 18:55.180
Appreciate the company.

18:55.180 --> 18:57.300
If not, that's fine too.

18:57.440 --> 19:00.740
Just to be clear, Admiral Hanson
will probably have me Court

19:00.740 --> 19:03.080
Martialed for going
against her orders.

19:03.540 --> 19:07.020
Which probably means she'll court martial
everybody else that comes along.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.880
The hell with it.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.410
I'm with you Chief.

19:11.970 --> 19:13.900
I'm ready to rock.

19:14.500 --> 19:18.150
I don't know how I feel about it.
I'm in.

19:18.150 --> 19:19.600
Let's do this.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.630
What are we waiting for?

19:21.630 --> 19:22.480
Hoo-yah!

19:22.480 --> 19:24.010
Hoo-yah!

19:24.990 --> 19:26.710
Sergeant Oliver.

19:26.710 --> 19:27.790
Yes Lieutenant.

19:27.790 --> 19:30.150
Are you sure this is the right
thing to do?

19:30.150 --> 19:32.970
Ma'am our job is to save lives.

19:32.970 --> 19:37.570
Regardless of the consequences or
what may or may not be the protocol.

19:37.570 --> 19:42.150
Now that's the President of theUnited States
of America at the bottom of that ocean.

19:42.150 --> 19:45.440
So if it means saving hislife...

19:45.440 --> 19:48.390
I'm willing to suffer the consequences.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.900
Prometheus preparing for launch.

20:05.860 --> 20:08.280
Alright, Rivas get the coordinates.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.340
Got it.

20:09.340 --> 20:10.650
Elfman, do we have sonar?

20:10.650 --> 20:12.030
Ready to roll.

20:12.030 --> 20:13.980
Alright, Captain Williams...

20:13.980 --> 20:15.290
You're all set Chief.

20:15.290 --> 20:17.150
Alright, let's do this guys.

20:18.170 --> 20:20.410
You don't have to do this.

20:21.110 --> 20:22.940
Listen up team...

20:22.940 --> 20:25.610
there are a lot of under water
currents as well as other

20:25.610 --> 20:27.890
variables that can affect this
ships systems.

20:27.890 --> 20:29.820
You're gonna need me for this.

20:29.820 --> 20:32.430
Plus there's no telling what we
might find down there.

20:32.430 --> 20:33.730
Right?

20:35.080 --> 20:37.570
Welcome aboard Lieutenant.

20:37.840 --> 20:40.030
Commander Lieutenant.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.480
Still waiting for our orders.

20:49.490 --> 20:50.710
Did you see that?

20:50.850 --> 20:52.490
Yes ma'am.

20:53.010 --> 20:55.450
They seem to be communicating.

20:55.450 --> 20:58.600
When one gets injured,
it retreats to the rear.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.380
And the others-

21:01.380 --> 21:03.640
Very sophisticated.

21:04.040 --> 21:08.300
CPO Vincent, What's the sitrep
on getting those SSAVs aboard?!

21:08.300 --> 21:11.770
Copy that Admiral.
They're coming in now!

21:11.950 --> 21:16.350
We need more heavy ordinance
port side, amidships! Now!

21:16.930 --> 21:20.860
I repeat, heavy ordinance
port side, amidships!

21:26.420 --> 21:28.890
TAKE COVER!

21:34.110 --> 21:36.450
You still need orders?

21:37.280 --> 21:39.390
Let's go!

21:44.680 --> 21:46.580
Admiral!

21:46.580 --> 21:48.530
Admiral!

21:50.790 --> 21:53.760
We just lost the Super Stallion.

21:54.290 --> 21:56.950
With the SSAV's?

21:57.260 --> 21:58.690
Damn!

22:06.980 --> 22:08.180
Sir!

22:08.180 --> 22:09.840
The Prometheus is launching!

22:09.840 --> 22:13.840
Man: Prometheus launch come in.
This is Prometheus launch, go ahead.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.790
What are you doing? Why is that
sub launching?

22:15.790 --> 22:18.940
Lieutenant commander Barclay
ordered it sir.

22:19.190 --> 22:23.410
Bridge. Bridge. The Prometheus
is launching.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.380
Admiral Hanson?

22:25.380 --> 22:28.660
The officer on the deck says that
the Prometheus has launched.

22:41.130 --> 22:42.630
Raise them.

22:42.630 --> 22:44.430
Yes Admiral.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.770
Prometheus.

22:46.770 --> 22:50.110
This is the USS Nemesis.
I repeat this is the USS Nemesis.

22:50.110 --> 22:51.950
Please respond.

22:52.470 --> 22:54.130
How do I respond?

22:54.130 --> 22:56.080
Don't respond.

22:56.080 --> 22:57.510
I've got to say something.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.990
Do not respond!

23:00.510 --> 23:03.520
DSRV 2 please respond.

23:04.200 --> 23:07.700
I say again Prometheus please respond.

23:07.850 --> 23:10.340
You're killing me man.

23:14.570 --> 23:20.800
Chief Oliver you will respond and comply
by immediately returning the Prometheus.

23:24.350 --> 23:27.060
Wow! Really?

23:41.260 --> 23:42.460
Hey.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.170
We all know what we're doing.

23:46.280 --> 23:48.020
Damn right.

23:48.660 --> 23:50.830
I didn't vote for him but what
the hell.

23:50.830 --> 23:53.280
Let's go get the President.

23:53.380 --> 23:56.040
Let's go save the President!

24:12.600 --> 24:16.430
Dr. Zimmer, I need you to get up
there on that deck

24:16.430 --> 24:19.830
and get some
kind of analysis on that thing.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.570
Copy that.

24:31.500 --> 24:35.250
You and the Admiral don't have such a
good working relationship, do you?

24:35.250 --> 24:37.470
No ma'am we do not.

24:37.470 --> 24:40.410
What's going on between you two
Chief?

24:40.430 --> 24:46.520
Because if I'm in the middle of it I'd
like to know what I've gotten myself into.

24:48.700 --> 24:50.110
Alright.

24:50.750 --> 24:55.330
Three years ago she was station
aboard the U.S.S. Harry Truman,

24:55.330 --> 24:59.710
We go a call to rescue one of her Tomcats
that had gone down in Afghanistan.

24:59.710 --> 25:02.540
The Intel was...

25:02.540 --> 25:05.700
Her Intel was shaky.

25:05.940 --> 25:08.970
We were almost to thecoordinates
we were last given,

25:08.970 --> 25:13.120
And Admiral Hanson decided to
pull from the mission.

25:15.460 --> 25:18.690
We were so close that I
instructed my team to go on.

25:18.690 --> 25:24.160
We lost radio contact, and the
LZ turned out to be a trap.

25:24.160 --> 25:27.440
We took some casualties...

25:27.440 --> 25:30.010
One if which is my best friend.

25:30.010 --> 25:31.980
And there was a down Tomcat.

25:31.980 --> 25:34.630
No more then 2 clicks away from us.

25:34.630 --> 25:39.210
If Admiral Hanson would have had her
act together then the pilot, my team,

25:39.210 --> 25:43.600
and my best friend... would
still be alive.

25:44.510 --> 25:46.630
- I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

25:46.630 --> 25:49.760
The loss of life is truly
regrettable.

25:49.760 --> 25:50.920
But uh...

25:50.920 --> 25:52.520
But what?

25:53.070 --> 25:55.210
She did call the mission.

25:55.210 --> 25:57.880
You continued on.

25:57.880 --> 26:04.040
Had you take orders, your friend
and teammates might still be alive.

26:05.470 --> 26:07.690
You don't understand...

26:07.690 --> 26:09.820
But we do.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.390
Sir!

26:12.390 --> 26:15.520
We have something coming in on
starboard side and it's big.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.440
It's coming in fast. I'm
clocking it at 30 knots.

26:18.440 --> 26:19.980
Alright, full throttle ahead.

26:19.980 --> 26:21.720
I. Full throttle.

26:30.090 --> 26:33.740
Barclay's down! Trip get up here!

26:35.520 --> 26:38.070
- Rivas give us a hand!
-Yeah.

26:38.690 --> 26:40.430
Come on!

26:42.480 --> 26:44.180
Woman: We're loosing it sir!

26:44.180 --> 26:45.720
Hold it tight.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.560
Hold this tight!

26:48.140 --> 26:50.090
We can't control her!

26:51.170 --> 26:52.930
Oh my God!

27:08.680 --> 27:10.630
All compartments secured.

27:10.630 --> 27:11.980
Oh no.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.730
Cut the power!
Cut the power!

27:15.730 --> 27:17.160
Lieutenant.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.240
Cut the power!

27:18.240 --> 27:19.650
Yes! That's what's attracting it.

27:19.650 --> 27:22.800
- Are you sure about this?
-Yes. I'm sure. Cut it off!

27:23.210 --> 27:25.390
Cut the power!
Cut the power!

27:27.360 --> 27:29.740
Our system is down.

27:31.000 --> 27:32.720
Power down.

27:41.530 --> 27:44.210
Your call Plummer.

27:47.310 --> 27:49.030
Alright Sir.

27:49.030 --> 27:50.880
It looks like it's moving.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.870
Give it a few seconds.

27:52.870 --> 27:56.270
We power up now we're liable to
attract more of those things.

27:56.270 --> 27:59.460
And we got less then 3 hours to
find this pod.

27:59.810 --> 28:02.880
The Gulf's stream runs through here.

28:02.900 --> 28:07.310
If Mr. Elfman will allow me, I
can navigate us into it.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.720
Let's see.

28:10.340 --> 28:13.640
We intermittently feather the
power on and off.

28:13.640 --> 28:16.620
Let the current do the rest.

28:17.240 --> 28:19.420
He's coming around.

28:19.940 --> 28:22.240
Hey hey, Take it easy.

28:23.690 --> 28:25.060
Rivas.

28:25.060 --> 28:28.230
Can you feed me the...
Pod encryption code?

28:28.230 --> 28:29.550
Yes ma'am.

28:29.550 --> 28:30.840
Alright guys.

28:30.840 --> 28:34.340
I've honed in the pod's location and
programmed the sub to take us there.

28:34.340 --> 28:37.470
We'll use the Gulf stream to get
us there.

28:37.470 --> 28:40.790
Margin of error, less the 1 percent.

28:42.150 --> 28:44.190
How'd you do that Lieutenant?

28:44.190 --> 28:47.460
Well it's simply a matter of
modulating the frequencies to

28:47.460 --> 28:50.400
compensate for the changes
in the ocean as descend.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.950
Temperature, Salinity.
Half a dozen other variables.

28:53.950 --> 28:56.990
But right now I suggest you hold
on to something tight.

28:56.990 --> 29:00.310
Because we are in for it. It's
about to get ugly.

29:24.810 --> 29:26.400
It's fascinating.

29:26.760 --> 29:31.360
Although it's Riftia pachyptila
or common Tubeworm.

29:31.360 --> 29:35.880
Such an enormous mutation of these
quantities is highly unlikely.

29:36.830 --> 29:42.070
They span 30 meters... above the surface
of the water. It's just the tentacles.

29:42.070 --> 29:49.600
They seem to have a centralnervous system
of another... Sea baring creature.

29:49.600 --> 29:55.110
If this is the case, the tentacles
can be as long as 7,000 meters.

30:24.440 --> 30:25.870
Help!

30:32.310 --> 30:34.530
Help!

30:50.090 --> 30:51.090
Thank you.

30:51.590 --> 30:54.800
Admiral: Dr. Zimmer, are you on
deck yet?

30:56.150 --> 30:58.200
Actually no.

30:59.150 --> 31:03.440
But I managed to get a more
manageable piece of specimen.

31:03.880 --> 31:06.720
I will be in my lab.

31:15.710 --> 31:18.260
Now watch this.

31:22.160 --> 31:26.530
You are telling me that these are appendages
that attached to something bigger.

31:26.530 --> 31:28.420
How does this experiment tell you that?

31:28.420 --> 31:30.800
Elementary neurology Admiral.

31:31.090 --> 31:34.470
You see where we inserted the
catheters into the specimen?

31:34.470 --> 31:37.930
These pathways are not too
similar to nerves.

31:38.010 --> 31:43.570
This deeper network of innovative wiring,
is congruous with the peripheral nerves

31:43.570 --> 31:47.010
of living organisms as we
know it here on earth.

31:47.010 --> 31:52.270
Now, in order to initiate the electrical
impulse I just demonstrated, it must originate

31:52.270 --> 31:57.080
from a central command center ora
central nervous system if you will.

31:58.010 --> 32:00.710
This organism, in of itself...

32:00.710 --> 32:03.674
it is not capable of
producing the electrical...

32:03.700 --> 32:06.905
...discharge that we witnessed
during those attacks.

32:07.170 --> 32:10.570
What did you mean by here on earth?

32:12.390 --> 32:15.500
This is clearly anon-terrestrial organism
Admiral.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.700
Look at it.

32:17.700 --> 32:20.690
But earlier you called it a
reptia-

32:20.690 --> 32:22.160
Riftia pachyptila.

32:22.160 --> 32:24.040
Yes you called it a Tubeworm.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.160
Until I dissected it, yes.

32:26.160 --> 32:29.850
It did display some Riftia
Pachyptila DNA

32:29.850 --> 32:36.190
but this is much more complex. I mean it's
simulated in a bio-mechanical organism

32:36.190 --> 32:40.230
from elsewhere other then our world. I mean
the components that make up this energy

32:40.230 --> 32:42.840
pathways are anything other then
this world.

32:42.840 --> 32:47.260
And you think that these are attached
to something bigger below the surface?

32:47.900 --> 32:52.210
I assure you my hypothesis is
not mere conjecture, Admiral.

32:53.890 --> 32:55.070
Captain Phillips.

32:55.070 --> 32:56.190
Admiral.

32:56.190 --> 33:01.600
I want to run deep surface detection
for massive organic life.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.440
Yes Admiral.

33:04.540 --> 33:07.050
Good work Dr. Zimmer.

33:17.390 --> 33:18.680
Hey sir.

33:19.030 --> 33:20.960
The water.

33:20.960 --> 33:24.040
It's going shallow. I'm reading
depths of 7 fathoms.

33:24.040 --> 33:25.080
What?

33:25.080 --> 33:26.340
7 fathoms.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.880
That can't be.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.160
Did you run diagnostic on your
equipments?

33:30.160 --> 33:32.870
Yes ma'am everything is
completely intact.

33:32.870 --> 33:35.860
Sir, the satellites are reading
that we are approximately 7

33:35.860 --> 33:37.990
fathoms of the same plain
of the pod encryption.

33:37.990 --> 33:41.140
That can't be. Something must
have broken during the attack.

33:41.990 --> 33:47.880
We could be in an under water cavern which
explains why the system is reading us 7 fathoms.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.180
It's reading off of a falsebottom.

33:50.180 --> 33:51.880
She's right.

33:51.980 --> 33:53.680
Blow ballasts.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.670
Blow ballasts.

34:12.870 --> 34:14.550
Check that out.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.929
Instruments are reading there's
oxygen.

34:17.929 --> 34:20.790
And pressure reads...

34:20.790 --> 34:23.550
1.03 atmospheres.

34:23.550 --> 34:27.860
That's impossible. That's normal AAP.
We're over 7,000 meters under sea level.

34:27.860 --> 34:29.639
Look for yourself.

34:29.639 --> 34:32.290
That would not make any sense.

34:32.290 --> 34:35.320
Unless it's being controlled
somehow.

34:36.540 --> 34:42.199
U.S.S. Nemesis, This is the Prometheus.
DSRV 2. Come in Nemesis?

34:42.570 --> 34:46.080
Admiral: This is the Nemesis.
We copy you Prometheus.

34:46.080 --> 34:49.330
Chief Oliver, what is your
location?

34:49.330 --> 34:54.320
We've landed in what appears to
be an underwater cavern, Admiral.

34:54.679 --> 34:57.310
Our depth however, isunknown.

34:57.310 --> 35:00.230
But the encryption appears to be
within our perimeter.

35:00.230 --> 35:03.440
Approximately two clicks from
our present location.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.060
Very well...

35:05.060 --> 35:08.380
Lieutenant Plummer is
with you?

35:09.790 --> 35:11.780
Yes Ma'am.

35:17.620 --> 35:19.710
Chief Oliver.

35:19.710 --> 35:21.910
Admiral: You have a mission to
do.

35:21.910 --> 35:26.510
Admiral: So do it. And keep me
apprised, do you understand?

35:26.510 --> 35:27.940
Yes Admiral.

35:27.940 --> 35:29.990
Nemesis out.

35:36.400 --> 35:40.170
That was weird. I could havesworn the Admiral
was gonna chew you a new one.

35:40.170 --> 35:42.300
She has too much to deal with up
there.

35:42.300 --> 35:47.530
Now look, we have now less then a hour to find
that Pod before the oxygen supply runs out.

35:47.530 --> 35:50.120
And the President dies.

35:50.120 --> 35:52.290
If he's not already dead.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.150
Admiral.

35:59.150 --> 36:01.100
You ok?

36:07.660 --> 36:10.080
Incoming!

36:41.540 --> 36:43.530
Get back!

36:57.720 --> 36:58.930
I've got it.

36:58.930 --> 37:01.970
We're approximately 2 kilometers
dead ahead.

37:11.440 --> 37:12.980
You hear that?

37:12.980 --> 37:14.330
Yeah.

37:14.570 --> 37:17.620
Elfman. Pipe in what's going on
out there.

37:17.620 --> 37:19.340
Copy that.

37:21.810 --> 37:24.560
What in the hell is that?

37:28.190 --> 37:29.600
I don't know.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.180
My god.

37:31.180 --> 37:34.280
Look at the walls and the
ceiling.

37:39.030 --> 37:40.880
It's mechanical.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.910
More like Bio-mechanical.

37:42.910 --> 37:46.990
cause if were fused with living
tissue...

37:46.990 --> 37:49.890
It's definitely something constructed.

37:49.890 --> 37:52.270
But not man made.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.530
It's non-terrestrial.

37:54.930 --> 37:56.460
She's right.

37:56.460 --> 38:00.480
Something is really controlling
the atmospheric pressure.

38:02.390 --> 38:04.130
Oh my god.

38:04.130 --> 38:06.600
It's like an airplane graveyard.

38:07.630 --> 38:11.280
Guess we're not the first ones
down here.

38:19.110 --> 38:23.050
Do you think anyone's alive down here?

38:23.260 --> 38:25.270
Let's hope so.

38:28.570 --> 38:29.850
Hey guys.

38:29.850 --> 38:32.300
I think that light up there is
the President's Pod.

38:35.030 --> 38:36.610
It's possible.

38:36.610 --> 38:40.130
Could be some for of
bioluminescence.

38:41.290 --> 38:44.750
This could be an alien outpost.

38:47.160 --> 38:49.000
Cuts right were we gotta go.

38:49.000 --> 38:53.420
Alright. Let's keep our eyes
peeled for a place to dock.

38:54.140 --> 38:56.590
This is absolutely amazing.

38:59.280 --> 39:03.630
This is the first real contact
with non-terrestrial life.

39:03.630 --> 39:05.870
As far as we know it.

39:05.870 --> 39:08.280
I'm sorry we do have more time
to explore this.

39:08.280 --> 39:09.810
We have a job to do.

39:09.810 --> 39:11.200
I know.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.580
Alright, we've got 45 minutes.

39:13.580 --> 39:15.720
Rivas, is there any change in
that signal?

39:15.720 --> 39:18.910
No Chief still dead ahead.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.060
Hanson.

39:30.060 --> 39:32.940
Set up temporary command HQ.

39:33.170 --> 39:36.210
And make sure instrumentation is
up and running.

39:38.990 --> 39:40.150
Yes!

39:40.500 --> 39:41.640
Yes!

39:46.080 --> 39:49.230
Yes Chairman Leary sorry. We
were just hit on the bridge.

39:49.230 --> 39:52.730
Chief Oliver and his team
are the Prometheus Prototype.

39:52.730 --> 39:57.580
We just received transmission from them that
they had surface in an underwater cavern.

39:57.580 --> 40:00.397
Yes. They located the
Presidentsescape Pod beacon.

40:00.423 --> 40:02.640
They set out on foot
to search for him.

40:02.640 --> 40:05.190
Admiral we have to get inside.

40:05.850 --> 40:07.590
Chairman: Have you heard from
them since?

40:07.590 --> 40:08.960
No sir.

40:16.380 --> 40:18.930
This is one hell of a junk yard.

40:18.930 --> 40:21.350
Bermuda Triangle is no joke.

40:23.840 --> 40:25.080
Alright.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.510
The eagle has landed.

40:27.510 --> 40:29.770
Ok team, suit up in your
bio gear.

40:29.770 --> 40:33.040
We don't know what organisms are in
this environment.

40:33.440 --> 40:36.570
Command Barclay, it's probably
best if you remained in the sub.

40:36.570 --> 40:38.270
I'll be fine Chief.

40:38.270 --> 40:39.630
Go do what you need to do.

40:39.630 --> 40:40.860
Alright.

40:40.860 --> 40:42.800
We'll be back.

41:42.640 --> 41:45.670
This would explain the Bermuda Triangle.

41:46.680 --> 41:50.140
These ships. This aircraft.

41:51.050 --> 41:53.830
They were drawn here to power this city.

41:54.040 --> 41:58.100
And that ship, that ship,
I don't believe it.

41:58.680 --> 42:01.730
That's the U.S.S. Cyclopes.

42:01.730 --> 42:04.010
It has to be.

42:05.130 --> 42:07.700
What's a U.S.S. Cyclopes?

42:07.700 --> 42:10.890
It was a cargo ship carrying coal.

42:10.890 --> 42:17.540
It vanished without a trace with the
entire crew of 106. After March 4th 1918.

42:17.540 --> 42:20.900
In the Bermuda Triangle.

42:21.520 --> 42:23.610
You sure about that?

42:23.610 --> 42:25.420
I'm positive.

42:25.420 --> 42:29.150
I studied old photographs of it.
100 times.

42:29.150 --> 42:33.170
Then I guess this been going on
for a hell of a long time then.

42:34.390 --> 42:37.830
I got the President's signal.
We're triangulating right now.

42:37.830 --> 42:41.330
Alright everyone, we got to spread out.

42:41.330 --> 42:45.850
We have 29 minutes until the oxygen
runs out in that escape Pod.

42:46.760 --> 42:50.020
Keep constant radio
contact and stay frosty!

42:50.020 --> 42:53.440
We don't know what kind of life
is down here.

42:55.760 --> 42:59.720
Hondo, Elfmam... Let's take the
left flank.

43:00.380 --> 43:02.740
Right behind you.

44:02.190 --> 44:03.840
Dammit!

44:12.730 --> 44:14.580
Alright.

44:14.580 --> 44:17.540
Everybody move out.

44:41.250 --> 44:45.520
Captain Phillips, I need you to find
out where that Ohio class nuke is?

44:45.520 --> 44:47.450
Yes Admiral.

44:50.190 --> 44:54.520
U.S.S. Maine. This is U.S.S.
Nemesis. What's your ETA?

44:54.520 --> 44:57.670
Man: This is the USS Maine, we
 are approximately 105 nautical

44:57.670 --> 45:01.460
miles from your location, ETA
80 ZERO minutes.

45:03.970 --> 45:05.850
Dammit!

45:18.810 --> 45:22.500
Well that sure as hell
ain't nobioluminescence.

45:22.680 --> 45:25.900
Hey chief you gotta see this.

45:28.320 --> 45:30.680
Yeah Honda.

45:30.990 --> 45:33.170
We see it.

45:51.310 --> 45:54.390
Guys we're running interference.

45:59.780 --> 46:01.790
Rivas! Come in!

46:01.790 --> 46:03.370
Rivas!

46:05.270 --> 46:08.900
Chief it's her tracking device,
but no Rivas.

46:13.090 --> 46:16.470
Chief it's another one of those
worms!

46:22.190 --> 46:24.590
Where's Rivas?

46:26.170 --> 46:28.430
What the hell were you shooting at?

46:28.430 --> 46:29.940
It was--

46:29.940 --> 46:33.210
It was one of those
creatures we saw at top sir.

46:33.210 --> 46:35.890
Son of a bitch.

46:35.890 --> 46:39.180
I told everyone "watch you six".

46:39.180 --> 46:42.950
Now we've got just over 14 minutes left!
We have to spread out to cover ground,

46:42.950 --> 46:44.820
and obviously we're not alone
down here.

46:44.820 --> 46:48.510
So stay sharp! And don't make me
say that again!

46:56.090 --> 46:58.560
Chief! I got! I got it!

47:04.720 --> 47:09.190
I found the president's
pod,30ft from your position.

47:10.600 --> 47:13.300
Good work Preach.

47:19.800 --> 47:23.760
You guys we got company, what ever
you gotta do, you gotta do it quick.

47:25.650 --> 47:28.490
We're working on it.

47:29.590 --> 47:32.530
He's got a pulse. The President
is alive.

47:32.530 --> 47:34.560
I need reserve oxygen.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.400
Get that mask on him
immediately.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.670
I don't know what that is.

47:48.010 --> 47:51.000
You guys we don't have much time.
You gotta do this quick.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.190
We almost got him.

47:55.160 --> 47:57.320
Hello Mr. President.

47:57.730 --> 47:59.120
Come on sir.

47:59.120 --> 48:01.070
We gotta move now!

48:02.330 --> 48:05.650
Alright frag it preach,
fire it up!

48:07.040 --> 48:09.230
Come on this way.

48:10.210 --> 48:11.540
Ha!

48:16.860 --> 48:19.600
Pull back! Pull back!

48:26.890 --> 48:29.530
Hondo! Hondo!

48:41.630 --> 48:44.990
President: What's going on?

48:48.220 --> 48:50.190
Are we clear?

48:56.240 --> 48:58.400
The city's lit up.

49:03.450 --> 49:05.420
Come on.

49:09.400 --> 49:11.230
President: Where am I?

49:11.230 --> 49:15.490
Mr. President you are 7000 meters
below the ocean surface, sir.

49:15.490 --> 49:19.540
I'm Chief petty officer Trip Oliver
with the United States Navy.

49:19.540 --> 49:21.400
President: Thank god.

49:21.400 --> 49:23.020
Let's get out of here.

49:23.020 --> 49:24.700
Oliver: Are you ok to walk?

49:24.700 --> 49:25.730
Yeah I'm fine.

49:25.730 --> 49:28.320
- Follow me.
- I'm fine.

49:31.100 --> 49:33.440
What in god's name is this place?

49:33.440 --> 49:35.970
We believe it's a city Mr. President.

49:35.970 --> 49:40.510
What we have seen suggests It was
built by an alien civilization.

49:41.280 --> 49:47.310
What information do you have to say that
there are aliens associated with this?

49:57.570 --> 50:00.550
Extra terrestrial intelligence
could be the only answer but

50:00.550 --> 50:03.040
something obviously
went wrong down here.

50:03.040 --> 50:05.030
Obviously.

50:05.030 --> 50:09.880
This would explain the legendary magnetic
forces of the Bermuda Triangle sir.

50:10.380 --> 50:12.740
Alright, we gotta get going sir.

50:12.740 --> 50:15.330
We've got a rescue submersible
waiting. Follow me.

50:15.330 --> 50:19.270
Chief, do you think we should
call in a strike force?

50:19.560 --> 50:21.670
I won't do that.

50:21.670 --> 50:23.870
We don't know enough about this
thing sir.

50:23.870 --> 50:28.160
If this has anything to do with those
tentacles up top, I say we blow them to hell.

50:28.160 --> 50:30.480
Tentacles?

50:44.490 --> 50:46.340
What have we got chief?

50:46.340 --> 50:50.850
Alright guys, we're surrounded by tentacles,
we're gonna have to shoot our way out of here.

50:50.850 --> 50:55.930
Preacher you take 9 o clock, Williams
take 3 o'clock. I'll get them 12.

50:55.930 --> 50:57.050
Got it.

50:57.050 --> 50:59.210
Copy that. Let's go!

51:02.070 --> 51:04.590
That ship's coming down guys,
it's on the move!

51:04.590 --> 51:05.670
Go go go!

51:05.670 --> 51:07.950
Go go go go!

51:47.210 --> 51:49.800
Go go go go!

52:06.560 --> 52:08.240
Come on!

52:15.080 --> 52:16.970
Preacher let's go!

52:21.840 --> 52:23.700
PREACHER!

52:29.320 --> 52:30.730
Where's Preacher?

52:30.730 --> 52:32.730
Where's Preacher?

52:32.730 --> 52:34.270
It's too late for Preacher.

52:34.270 --> 52:37.050
Begin preparations for getting
under way.

52:37.050 --> 52:38.070
Copy that.

52:38.070 --> 52:40.120
All stations are ready to
get under way.

52:40.120 --> 52:41.200
Ready for dive.

52:41.200 --> 52:42.130
Copy that.

52:42.130 --> 52:43.890
Rigging for dive.

52:47.700 --> 52:49.260
Dammit power is out.

52:49.260 --> 52:52.100
Chief hit the auxiliary pump on
the stern ballast.

52:52.930 --> 52:55.100
Stern ballast miles engaged.

52:55.100 --> 52:56.740
Main Ballast!

52:57.360 --> 52:59.250
Main Ballast Engaged!

52:59.250 --> 53:01.180
Auxiliary pump is down.

53:01.180 --> 53:03.000
Hey! You need to talk to me.

53:03.000 --> 53:04.760
I need you to stay on the pumps.

53:04.760 --> 53:06.980
Lieutenant get back here!

53:07.040 --> 53:08.140
Copy that commander.

53:08.140 --> 53:10.850
I know how to handle the wires.

53:12.350 --> 53:14.130
Come on you guys! You're right on!

53:14.130 --> 53:15.770
Hold the blue wires.

53:15.770 --> 53:17.070
You got that.

53:17.070 --> 53:19.390
All engines in reverse.

53:19.500 --> 53:20.620
Full speed!

53:20.620 --> 53:21.800
Copy that!

53:22.320 --> 53:23.270
Hit me!

53:23.270 --> 53:24.780
Hitting you.

53:25.300 --> 53:26.900
Come on you guys let's go!

53:26.900 --> 53:28.200
Hit me again!

53:28.700 --> 53:30.010
Hitting you again.

53:30.010 --> 53:32.450
They're attacking to the windows!
Let's go!

53:32.740 --> 53:35.080
2...1. Hit!

53:35.080 --> 53:36.180
We got power!

53:36.180 --> 53:38.010
Alright come on!
Let's go!

54:06.570 --> 54:08.290
Nice work commander.

54:08.290 --> 54:10.130
Thank you. You too.

54:12.600 --> 54:15.910
Lieutenant commander, I
don't know we've met yet.

54:15.910 --> 54:18.320
Lieutenant commander Jude
Barclay Mr. President.

54:18.320 --> 54:20.160
I want to thank you for your
service.

54:20.160 --> 54:21.700
Yes sir. My pleasure sir.

54:21.700 --> 54:25.990
You. You and your team for your
sacrifice.

54:26.360 --> 54:29.450
I know how it is to loose
men under my command.

54:29.860 --> 54:31.480
Thank you sir.

54:31.660 --> 54:33.570
But we're not out of the woods
yet sir,

54:33.570 --> 54:34.750
Right.

54:34.750 --> 54:36.080
It's coming guys.

54:36.080 --> 54:37.800
HOLD ON!

54:44.020 --> 54:45.380
Hydraulics at full.

54:45.380 --> 54:46.550
What's happening?

54:46.550 --> 54:49.220
Is that that thing that was
chasing us outside?

54:49.220 --> 54:51.910
No Mr. President, No it's the Gulf stream.
It's what got us here.

54:53.070 --> 54:55.210
Hang on tight sir.

55:01.670 --> 55:03.440
I don't remember that!

55:03.440 --> 55:04.700
Full speed ahead.

55:04.700 --> 55:06.900
We're at 30 knots sir!

55:07.150 --> 55:09.160
Come on! Come on!

55:12.780 --> 55:15.790
We're not gonna make it.
Give it some more juice!

55:15.790 --> 55:17.740
I'm giving it all she's got sir.

55:17.940 --> 55:19.890
The doors are closing.

55:24.220 --> 55:28.000
Suggest going left to course zero niner five,
forty five degrees sir.

55:30.030 --> 55:32.660
Do it! We don't have any otherchoice!

55:32.660 --> 55:36.040
Taking her 90 degrees left.
Everybody hold on tight.

55:52.120 --> 55:53.860
Whoo!

55:54.440 --> 55:55.640
Whoo Yah!

55:55.640 --> 55:56.870
Whoo Yah!

55:56.870 --> 55:58.820
Good job Lieutenant!

55:58.940 --> 56:00.660
Good Job men.

56:04.080 --> 56:06.210
What's that?

56:12.540 --> 56:14.770
Are we inside that thing?

56:14.770 --> 56:16.810
It's unbelievable.

56:24.600 --> 56:26.900
This is not good.

56:34.460 --> 56:35.960
It's coming at us!

56:35.960 --> 56:38.050
Blow all tanks! Blow everything!

56:38.050 --> 56:39.640
Ballast Release!

56:46.920 --> 56:49.180
- Look out!
- Watch out!

56:49.610 --> 56:52.080
Coming from port side.

56:53.300 --> 56:54.770
Look out!

56:59.770 --> 57:00.930
Abort!

57:13.530 --> 57:17.100
The ship's not designed for that.
It will breach the haul.

57:17.100 --> 57:18.800
Is there anything we can do?

57:18.800 --> 57:21.120
Just can't get hit.

57:21.320 --> 57:22.650
Oh stop!

57:22.650 --> 57:23.520
All stop!

57:23.520 --> 57:25.450
Hard right rudder!
Hard right rudder!

57:31.190 --> 57:32.990
The hull has been compromised!

57:32.990 --> 57:35.520
Pressure system is at 70% sir.

57:36.520 --> 57:38.900
Can't take another hit like that.

57:42.130 --> 57:44.370
That thing is catching up to us guys!

57:44.370 --> 57:46.260
We're not gonna make it out
with a rate like this.

57:46.260 --> 57:50.150
Lieutenant Commander Barclay?
What's the power source for this vessel?

57:50.420 --> 57:53.010
Silver Zinc batteries?

57:53.010 --> 57:56.020
If we bypassed the regulator and
overload protection device,

57:56.020 --> 57:59.380
we could in effect, deliver a
surgeto the primary thrusters right?

57:59.750 --> 58:02.670
It would give us a boost to go home right?

58:02.670 --> 58:05.860
It would get us to the surface,

58:05.860 --> 58:09.950
because the overload could
short out the electric batteries.

58:09.950 --> 58:11.790
And that would leave us dead in
the water.

58:11.790 --> 58:13.100
Yes sir.

58:13.100 --> 58:15.150
Chief any thoughts?

58:15.580 --> 58:18.010
I've always been one for risks sir.

58:18.010 --> 58:19.980
I say we go for it.

58:19.980 --> 58:22.320
I'm with Chief Oliver Mr.
President.

58:22.320 --> 58:23.600
I saw we do it.

58:23.600 --> 58:24.810
Yeah Barclay?

58:24.810 --> 58:25.720
Yes sir!

58:25.720 --> 58:26.610
Let's go!

58:26.610 --> 58:27.480
Keep it steady.

58:27.480 --> 58:28.290
Will do.

58:28.290 --> 58:29.820
Plummer bypass regulator.

58:30.750 --> 58:32.790
Copy that commander.

58:32.790 --> 58:34.800
By passing regulator.

58:38.710 --> 58:40.140
She's ready.

58:40.520 --> 58:43.400
You realize the battery overload
could explode?

58:43.400 --> 58:44.870
We know that!

58:44.870 --> 58:45.970
Let's engage!

58:45.970 --> 58:47.290
Yes sir!

58:49.010 --> 58:50.530
It's almost at us!

58:50.530 --> 58:53.490
Alright I think we have to stay
in our seats for this.

58:53.490 --> 58:54.460
Lieutenant?

58:54.460 --> 58:55.190
Yes?

58:55.190 --> 58:57.570
Just let me know when the
battery is fully charged.

58:57.570 --> 59:00.020
Yes sir, we are at 70%.

59:00.210 --> 59:01.800
It's coming for us.

59:01.800 --> 59:03.110
80%. 90%.

59:03.110 --> 59:04.000
90%.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.670
3.2.1.

59:06.670 --> 59:08.040
Now at 100%.

59:08.040 --> 59:10.050
Alright, Now!

59:29.360 --> 59:30.630
At ease.

59:30.630 --> 59:32.040
The Prometheus is on board.

59:32.040 --> 59:33.720
Great. Go meet them.

59:33.720 --> 59:36.700
get a chopper ready for the President
to immediate evacuation.

59:36.700 --> 59:39.900
And get Lieutenant Plummer and Chief
Oliver down here immediately.

59:39.900 --> 59:41.330
I. I. Admiral.

59:41.600 --> 59:44.370
We need a medic down here!

59:56.970 --> 59:59.190
Mr. President. Welcome aboard sir.

59:59.190 --> 01:00:02.670
Captain. Can you fill me in on
what's going on up here?

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:04.060
- If you'll follow me?
-Thank you.

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:05.160
Watch your head.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:07.340
We are preparing for your
immediate evacuation.

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:09.020
And I'll fill you in.

01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:10.760
I want you to bring me to the
bridge first.

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.080
The bridge is gone sir.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:16.350
We have suffered some serious damage. And I
have orders to evacuate you immediately.

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:18.840
Well, you have new orders Captain.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:21.430
Take me up to the Admiral.

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:24.620
Yes Mr. President.

01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:38.030
Mr. President so glad you're alright sir.

01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:41.020
We have a helo for your
immediate evacuation.

01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:45.100
Do you currently have any
strategic submarines in your fleet?

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:48.250
We're awaiting for the arrival
of an Ohio Class SSBN.

01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.220
But Sir, we need to get you
off this ship.

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.040
I am not going anywhere.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.380
Now, Lieutenant Plummer and
Chief Oliver I want you to tell

01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:58.590
the Admiral what it was that we
encountered down there.

01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:01.350
I need to contact Washington
immediately.

01:01:01.350 --> 01:01:05.200
Sir, it is to the utmost importance
that we get you off this ship now--

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.620
I said, I am not going anywhere.

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:11.980
You're familiar with my record
as a Marine, in combat.

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:13.840
Of course. But your safety--

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.720
And we both took the same oath,
Admiral.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:21.600
We both swore that we would defend the
constitution of the United States against

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:24.060
enemies both foreign and
domestic.

01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.150
I took that oath and a few
others.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.020
Yes sir.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:32.600
Now we are in contact, with an
alien civilization for the first

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.980
time in history and we're
being attacked.

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:38.850
It's my duty.

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:40.910
To handle that attack.

01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:42.140
Mr. President.

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.320
The White House.

01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:44.460
Thank you.

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:46.690
Yes this is the President.

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:48.370
President: Yes.

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:51.750
I warned you about taking risks.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:54.610
This time you got lucky.

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:56.830
Yes Admiral.

01:01:56.830 --> 01:02:03.210
Admiral Hanson, we discovered these tubeworms
are connected to something much larger.

01:02:03.210 --> 01:02:06.320
Yes, Dr. Zimmer arrived
at thesame conclusion.

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:08.390
What else did you learn?

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:13.200
There's a city at it's core and a massive
graveyard with ships and aircrafts.

01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:16.037
They are being are being drawn
in by huge lighting panels...

01:02:16.063 --> 01:02:17.780
...that seem to be
powering the city.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:20.060
Zimmer: Most likely the tentacles as well.

01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:23.190
Now there must be a limit to how much
energy this creature can expel

01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:25.470
before it need to power
down and regenerate.

01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:29.800
That would corroborate with the behavior
that our specimen manifested.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:33.680
So we should direct an attack
while it's in this recovery mode?

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.900
I believe so.

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:36.980
Yes.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:38.140
You have a plan?

01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:39.320
Yes sir.

01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:44.130
We will coordinate our sub surface surge
with the U.S.S. Maine and we will attack

01:02:44.130 --> 01:02:46.550
the creature while they appear
to be in recover mode.

01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:48.190
Alright good.

01:02:48.640 --> 01:02:51.170
Do you have any theories?

01:02:51.170 --> 01:02:54.050
We don't have much to go on
right now Admiral. But we do

01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:56.480
know that they've been here
for quite sometime.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:03:00.890
Those energy panels were erected to fuel
the city and sustain life by gathering

01:03:00.890 --> 01:03:05.180
machines powered by nuclear
energy or fossil fuels.

01:03:05.180 --> 01:03:08.250
And they're clearly hostile so I
believe we are doing the right thing.

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:11.570
Take the fight to it while it's
still vulnerable.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.210
What the hell was that?

01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.160
Admiral!

01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:23.880
I believe out hypothesis is
accurate!

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.850
Admiral: God all mighty.

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:24.350
It's gonna attack.

01:04:24.350 --> 01:04:26.280
We need to strike first.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.880
The Chief is right Admiral.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.520
I suggest we attack.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.510
Do it now!

01:04:33.290 --> 01:04:36.830
All ships! All Ship!
Authorized to engage!

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:39.090
Authorized to engage!

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:14.660
Nothing has any affect on it.

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:20.000
It's gonna attack again.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.690
We've got to get the President back.
Come on let's go! Go go go go!

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:25.560
Let's go inside!

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:32.190
Mr. President, I am not sure
that we have any other options.

01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:37.140
President: How long before that
thing hits the coast?

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.160
Approximately 55 minutes sir.

01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:49.680
I'm authorizing the use ofnuclear weapons.

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:52.770
Contact the U.S.S. Maine.

01:05:52.770 --> 01:05:54.720
Immediately.

01:05:55.860 --> 01:06:00.730
You do realize Mr. President that the use if
nuclear weapons this close to the shoreline

01:06:00.730 --> 01:06:02.490
will likely result in a nuclearfallout.

01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:03.690
Please Doctor.

01:06:03.690 --> 01:06:06.680
People will die! Including us.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:11.280
A huge portion of the land will become
uninhabitable for years to come.

01:06:13.770 --> 01:06:15.670
I'm well aware of that doctor.

01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:19.320
I'm also aware that 7 billion
people on this planet.

01:06:20.310 --> 01:06:23.780
This alien race has declared
unprovoked war on us.

01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:27.220
And in war, there will always be
casualties.

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:30.700
My job is to minimize that loss
of life.

01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:35.880
So if a small percentage relative to the
entire world's population must perish,

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:39.780
then those are the
unfortunate consequences.

01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:48.670
I want a 50 mile radius
no fly zone declared.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.630
This is ground zero.

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:54.010
Yes, Mr. President.

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:59.180
U.S.S. Nemesis to U.S.S. Maine.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.850
Do you copy?

01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.500
U.S.S. Maine: We copy over?

01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:07.400
U.S.S. Nemesis: Arm
the nuclear weapons.

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:10.010
U.S.S. Maine: Roger that.
Nuclear weapons are hot.

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:15.050
It is preparing to attack.

01:07:22.950 --> 01:07:24.190
Now.

01:07:30.570 --> 01:07:32.670
What was that?

01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:34.370
U.S.S. Genesis.

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:37.040
The U.S.S. Genesis, is gone.

01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.050
Where did it go? Did we hurt it?

01:07:48.050 --> 01:07:48.960
Ensign?

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.850
Current velocity and course will put it at
Cape Hatteras in approximately 40 minutes.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.300
We can't do a nuclear
strike over the continent.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.220
It is one thing to do it out to
sea, but over the continent--

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:03.960
We don't have a choice doctor.

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.460
People will die!

01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:07.460
Millions!

01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.319
Mr. President.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:20.340
Soldier.

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:22.840
What about a strike to the
center core of the spaceship.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.540
Point blank.

01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:27.029
What are you proposing Chief?

01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:30.120
Those lightning panels we saw at
the city.

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:32.880
That's what's manufacturing
power to this thing, right?

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:34.080
Yes Chief.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:38.930
So if we hit it as it's source, couldn't
we produce some sort of implosion?

01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:43.220
Yes, it's very possible.

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:47.510
We can't just fire a missile
into the core of that ship and

01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:50.580
hope to hit this
city that you're talking about.

01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.710
Not from the sub. No.

01:08:52.710 --> 01:08:55.689
Well if not from a sub then how
soldier?

01:08:55.859 --> 01:08:59.490
We rig a conventional warhead
to a portable launcher.

01:08:59.490 --> 01:09:01.660
Captain Warren flies me in.

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:04.540
And I deliver the strike point
blank.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.399
We're your best option Mr.
President.

01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:10.740
It could work.

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.260
Right. Well what do you think?

01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:22.290
I'm not sure Mr. President.
Possibly it could be done.

01:09:22.290 --> 01:09:26.000
What concerns me is the amount of
time it would take to orchestrate it.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.830
The ship would be that muchfurther in land.

01:09:30.990 --> 01:09:32.229
Soldiers.

01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:34.229
You men know what you're doing,
don't yeah?

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:35.380
Yes sir.

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.100
Yes sir.

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:39.029
You've got 15 minutes.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.540
Got it?

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:43.050
- Sir yes sir.
- Move fast!

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.340
Chief Oliver.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.940
- Chief!
- Yes Lieutenant?

01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:05.710
Yes.

01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:08.460
You were right about your
decision.

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:13.870
I see you when I get back.

01:10:29.230 --> 01:10:33.810
Ok team, this is your standard AT4,
but with some special modifications.

01:10:33.810 --> 01:10:38.120
We will equip the round with a specially
modified low yield conventional warhead.

01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:40.670
No one's ever fired anythinglike it before.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:42.930
So I wish I could tell you more
about the trajectory.

01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:45.480
But truth is, I don't know.

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:46.780
Good luck Chief,

01:10:46.780 --> 01:10:47.990
Thanks Gunny.

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:50.800
You know I can fly this bird in
on my own Captain.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.660
I lost a lot of my team today and there's
no reason to add you to my casualty list.

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:58.160
Flown a lot of missions together
chief. This one's no different.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.860
Yes sir.

01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:08.170
Give me a direct line to Chief Oliver.

01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:10.720
Let's get a direct line to Air Hawk 1.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.320
Copy that.

01:11:12.610 --> 01:11:14.580
Here you go sir.

01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:17.710
Chief Oliver.

01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.450
Yes Mr. President?

01:11:19.450 --> 01:11:22.060
President: We only have one
shot, you know that?

01:11:22.060 --> 01:11:23.430
Yes Mr. President.

01:11:23.430 --> 01:11:26.760
Don't worry.
One shot is all I need sir.

01:11:29.060 --> 01:11:31.120
I'm grateful for your service son.

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.440
Thank you sir.

01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:35.240
Good luck.

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.420
You ready Chief?

01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:47.740
Let's do it!

01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:53.890
Radio: Foxtrot Romeo 1-33
ready for take off.

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:57.400
Radio: Air hawk one, you are clear
for take off, go get 'em boys.

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.970
Copy that!

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.410
Warren: That thing is huge!

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:22.060
My god! you were inside that thing?

01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:23.450
Yeah!

01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:27.030
You really think this is gonna work?

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.280
Hell yes!

01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:34.580
Good enough for me.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.300
Dr. Zimmer.

01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:40.190
How long did it take that tentacle
to regenerate in your experiment?

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:42.040
2 minutes.

01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:49.110
The spacecraft is still on
line with Cape Hatteras.

01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:52.050
It's approximately fifteen
minutes out, and the U.S.S.

01:12:52.050 --> 01:12:53.850
Maine is less than 10 minutes away.

01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:58.250
Air hawk 1. The U.S.S. Maine is
10 minutes out. What's your status?

01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:02.660
We will engage in the next
6minutes and 30 seconds Admiral.

01:13:04.170 --> 01:13:05.520
Admiral Hanson?

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:06.790
Yes, Lieutenant?

01:13:06.790 --> 01:13:10.720
The spacecraft takes exactly 2 minutes
to regenerate between attacks.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.450
The same as Dr. Zimmer's
experiment with his specimen.

01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:18.040
Air hawk 1.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:21.790
The alien spacecraft is attacking
you in exactly 2 minutes intervals.

01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:25.330
You must wait until the next attack.
You won't make it to the

01:13:25.330 --> 01:13:28.260
core with the time that you have left.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.120
The thing is going to attack Hatteras next.
We don't have time to wait.

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:37.850
That's a negative Admiral.
We're out of time.

01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:40.130
Cape Hatteras is the next
probable target.

01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:42.060
We need to take the shoot.

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:45.480
No offense Admiral,
but we can't wait.

01:13:46.450 --> 01:13:48.280
Oh dammit.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:55.160
If he doesn't get this done. We
have to launch the nukes.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:00.280
Air Hawk 1, you will ceaseengagement
immediately. You must wait.

01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:04.440
If we abort, 20 thousand
peoplewill be killed!

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:09.190
You don't have time! The greater
population density takes precedence!

01:14:09.190 --> 01:14:13.540
If you fail, the aircraft will
go and attack Tampa or Miami

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:18.660
and we will be force to fire nuclear
weapons over a greater population.

01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:21.520
Cape Hatteras is a necessary sacrifice.

01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:39.570
He's going in.

01:14:39.570 --> 01:14:44.590
Chief Oliver, you will stand down.
I repeat, you will stand down!

01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:46.700
Admiral: Do you hear?!

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.840
Plummer: We have 4 minutes 45
seconds left Admiral.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:52.900
Radio: Foxtrot Romeo 1-33 we
are entering enemy airspace.

01:14:53.070 --> 01:14:58.020
Listen, you and I don't likeeach
other and we probably never will.

01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.070
I understand that you blame mefor
the death of you best friend

01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:04.200
based on orders that I gave you
3 years ago.

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.690
But at this moment you will listen
and you will obey my orders.

01:15:08.690 --> 01:15:11.720
You are to stand down till
afterthe next attack.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:14.720
And the you are clear to engage.
Do you hear me?

01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:18.790
If we wait, we may not even
survive to attack this thing.

01:15:18.790 --> 01:15:20.470
Look. Look.

01:15:20.470 --> 01:15:23.910
If you go in now maybe you save
20 thousand lives,

01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:28.260
but if you go in and you fail,
and if you are killed...

01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:32.690
then millions, and I tell you
millions of people will die

01:15:32.690 --> 01:15:36.260
and that is because you have
left us with no choice!

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:41.650
Sometimes you must accept a moderate casualty
rate, in order to prevent a large one.

01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:43.840
That's just the way it is!

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.180
You cannot save everyone!

01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:52.510
Chief Oliver?

01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:56.320
Chief Oliver, do you copy?

01:15:57.710 --> 01:15:59.390
FLANK RIGHT!

01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:01.380
My god.

01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:04.280
Chief Oliver.

01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:07.000
Oh my god.

01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:09.070
What happened?

01:17:09.070 --> 01:17:12.990
Cape Hatteras has been destroyed.

01:17:14.290 --> 01:17:16.110
It's gone.

01:17:16.110 --> 01:17:20.570
Oh my god. 20 thousand people.

01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:32.530
Chief Petty officer. You get in there
and you destroy hell out of that ship!

01:17:33.630 --> 01:17:35.800
Copy that Admiral.

01:17:36.900 --> 01:17:38.560
Let's do this Captain!

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:41.500
Keep him apprised of how much
time he has left.

01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:43.760
Yes Admiral.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.500
Chief Oliver?

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.480
This is Lieutenant Plummer.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.660
Copy Lieutenant.

01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:53.790
I'll keep you up on your time.

01:17:53.790 --> 01:17:57.570
Plummer: You have exactly 1
minute 45 seconds left.

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:01.860
Copy that Lieutenant.

01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:06.420
Warren: Foxtrot Romeo
1-33 entering the fisher.

01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:22.370
You see this Trip?

01:18:23.330 --> 01:18:25.480
It's incredible.

01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:29.770
Plummer: One minute 25
seconds left Chief.

01:18:30.020 --> 01:18:32.090
Copy that Lieutenant!

01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:34.080
How far away are you from the center?

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:35.660
Chief: It's hard to tell.

01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:37.480
But we're gonna make it.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:40.300
Tell everyone not to worry.

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:44.070
We know we can do this Chief.

01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.800
We got trouble.
Hang on!

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:53.440
Hold it steady!

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.370
I can't!

01:18:54.370 --> 01:18:56.630
It's too many of them!

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.350
I can't fire!

01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:09.280
Rotate it on it's axis!

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.370
Why? So I can kill us before they do?

01:19:11.370 --> 01:19:12.740
Just do it!

01:19:32.050 --> 01:19:33.610
Whoa!

01:19:34.250 --> 01:19:36.260
Great job Chief!

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.960
Thanks Captain!

01:19:42.330 --> 01:19:45.400
You have exactly 1 minute 10 seconds.

01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:48.630
Copy that Lieutenant!

01:19:49.940 --> 01:19:53.420
They won't have enough
time to get out of there.

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:55.680
He'll do it.

01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:58.830
Plummer: 1 minute left Chief.

01:19:58.830 --> 01:20:00.490
Chief: Copy that Lieutenant!

01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:04.530
I'm glad it was you giving me
the countdown.

01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:06.150
Me too.

01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:09.010
It would be a great time to use
that thing!

01:20:09.010 --> 01:20:10.250
Hold on a second!

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:12.250
We don't have a second!

01:20:25.150 --> 01:20:26.460
Trip!

01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:28.470
Trip! Where the hell are you?

01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:30.670
I'm exterior the bird, Captain!

01:20:30.670 --> 01:20:31.910
I'll be right up!

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:34.710
Well get some pass on that thing!

01:20:35.020 --> 01:20:37.070
It's pulling us down!

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:49.300
Plummer: 30 seconds left Chief.

01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.270
Plummer: 10.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.290
9.

01:20:59.290 --> 01:21:02.090
Alright Captain bring us back
around. I'm ready to engage!

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:02.890
Plummer: 7.

01:21:02.890 --> 01:21:03.970
You got it.

01:21:04.180 --> 01:21:05.750
Plummer: 6.

01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:07.580
5.

01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:09.030
4.

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:11.790
- Take that son of a bitch out.
- Plummer: 3.

01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:14.020
Plummer: 2.

01:21:14.290 --> 01:21:15.790
Plummer: 1.

01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:21.800
Get us out of here!

01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:32.990
Nothing happened.

01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:36.800
Nothing...happened.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.950
Air hawk 1. Do you read?

01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:41.530
Chief Oliver?

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:43.450
Captain Phillips...

01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:47.210
Would you please call the U.S.S. Maine.

01:21:48.350 --> 01:21:50.400
Yes. Admiral.

01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:56.100
U.S.S. Maine. This is the U.S.S. Nemesis.

01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:06.070
What happened? What was that?

01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:22.870
It didn't work.

01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:25.420
The explosion might have been absorbed.

01:22:51.970 --> 01:22:55.330
Yes! Yes!

01:22:55.770 --> 01:22:57.300
Whoo!

01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.400
Look! Up there!

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.460
It's the Chief!

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:25.090
Warren: Foxtrot Romeo 1-33 to U.S.S. Nemesis
requesting permission to land.

01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:27.970
We're coming home.

01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:47.290
HOO-YAH!
