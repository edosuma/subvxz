01:04.664 --> 01:07.001
<i>Despite some
encouraging economic news today,</i>

01:07.134 --> 01:09.769
<i>not all working Americans are
feeling a positive impact.</i>

01:09.904 --> 01:12.440
Many millennials are still
struggling financially,

01:12.572 --> 01:14.874
especially when compared
to past generations.

01:15.009 --> 01:17.044
<i>Let's bring in my good friend
George "Tyrus" Murdoch...</i>

01:17.178 --> 01:19.646
Millennials blame Baby Boomers
for ruining their lives.

01:19.779 --> 01:22.016
<i>Fifty-one percent of
millennials surveyed by...</i>

01:22.149 --> 01:24.784
<i>...the "Burn Out"
generation, with the stress caused</i>

01:24.919 --> 01:27.487
<i>by several factors
like anxiety, work ethic...</i>

01:27.620 --> 01:30.890
<i>Millennials: Are they just having
a negative overall impact on this economy?</i>

01:31.025 --> 01:33.327
...debt in this country
has topped $1 trillion.

01:33.461 --> 01:36.263
No appreciation for the work ethic.
There's also a lack of skills.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.698
...of the recent college
graduates are getting jobs...

01:38.832 --> 01:41.801
<i>...worried about these home
invasion robberies happening...</i>

01:41.936 --> 01:43.503
Is this the next
financial crisis?

01:52.779 --> 01:56.750
<i>They don't even have a clear picture
of the gunmen's faces, minus the masks...</i>

01:56.883 --> 02:00.121
<i>In all, Chicago police
have issued two community alerts.</i>

02:05.525 --> 02:07.995
<i>Now police need
your help finding them.</i>

02:08.129 --> 02:10.730
<i>Definitely want to
catch up with this crew.</i>

02:32.219 --> 02:34.422
- <i>I'm in.</i>
- <i>Throw this on before you get out.</i>

02:34.554 --> 02:36.790
- <i>Says you're joining us.</i>
- <i>You are new here...</i>

02:36.924 --> 02:39.626
- <i>You trust me?</i>
- <i>Don't you think you deserve...</i>

02:39.759 --> 02:41.195
- <i>Lance.</i>
- <i>Lance.</i>

02:41.328 --> 02:42.463
Lance.

02:43.464 --> 02:47.134
I want to thank you for
agreeing to talk with me.

02:47.268 --> 02:51.238
With this book, you will
have the opportunity

02:51.372 --> 02:55.842
to tell your story,
from your point of view.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.112
Can you give that to me?

02:59.779 --> 03:01.714
I can give you
my point of view,

03:01.848 --> 03:04.919
but I can't guarantee
you'll understand it.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.886
Why is that?

03:08.456 --> 03:10.257
Bit of a generation gap.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.526
You're right.

03:12.659 --> 03:15.496
I've got
a few years on you.

03:16.230 --> 03:18.099
I think you'll
find me up to speed.

03:19.133 --> 03:22.669
But I really, really want to
learn something along the way.

03:24.572 --> 03:27.007
You can help me bridge that gap.

03:30.044 --> 03:31.078
Okay.

03:32.645 --> 03:33.981
Okay.

03:34.115 --> 03:36.283
When did this all
begin for you?

03:37.184 --> 03:39.086
With a train
ticket to Chicago.

03:44.291 --> 03:46.826
<i>I'll never forget
how much that ticket cost.</i>

03:53.633 --> 03:55.035
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

03:55.702 --> 03:57.704
Yes, I made it safe.

03:57.837 --> 03:59.940
No, Jack's picking me up.

04:00.074 --> 04:03.410
He said he put in
a good word, it'll be fine.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.080
All right, I love you.

04:06.646 --> 04:07.948
Bye.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.924
Hey, Lance.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.659
- Hey, Jack!
- What's new, baby boy?

04:19.792 --> 04:21.562
- Man, it's good to see you.
- What's going on?

04:21.694 --> 04:23.230
Good to see you.
You're looking good.

04:23.364 --> 04:24.999
Give me this stuff.
Let's get out of here.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.268
- Thank you, man.
- Of course. Oh, my God!

04:27.401 --> 04:28.835
Thanks for picking me up.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.905
Come on, what,
do you think I'm gonna make you walk?

04:31.038 --> 04:33.040
I can't believe
you drive a Porsche.

04:33.174 --> 04:34.975
Yeah, man,
it does the trick.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.876
So, how's everyone
back in Dixie?

04:37.011 --> 04:38.811
They're good, man.
They miss you.

04:38.946 --> 04:42.316
If they miss me that much, they can
come up and visit me once in a while.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.717
That's true.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.520
How's life been
treating you, post-college?

04:48.088 --> 04:50.024
- It's been rough.
- Why is that?

04:50.157 --> 04:52.626
I mean, I can't even tell you
how many job interviews

04:52.759 --> 04:54.328
I've struck out on
since I graduated school.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.696
I'm looking for someone
with real-world experience.

04:56.829 --> 05:00.067
- Never worked in an art gallery?
- This is a highly competitive intern position.

05:00.201 --> 05:02.336
- You are way too qualified for this.
- If anything changes...

05:02.469 --> 05:05.039
- Gonna give you some valuable...
- We'll keep your resume on file.

05:05.172 --> 05:07.041
Wouldn't you be happier
in your own field?

05:07.174 --> 05:09.809
I hear you.
Job market was kicking my ass too,

05:09.944 --> 05:12.046
but that's why I took
matters into my own hands.

05:12.179 --> 05:14.481
It's just a start-up, but, like,
you'll be doing what you love,

05:14.615 --> 05:17.017
- I think you'd be perfect for it.
- Thank you, Jack.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.953
I know it's been like
three years or something,

05:19.086 --> 05:20.554
but I've been keeping
my eye out for you.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.855
I saw on Facebook that you
graduated and I was like,

05:22.990 --> 05:25.292
"Shit, who better to
ask than my own cousin?"

05:25.426 --> 05:27.860
I didn't even know that
you were involved in art.

05:28.929 --> 05:31.898
Well, I mean,
it's not really about the art.

05:32.032 --> 05:33.968
Just pays well.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.270
Well, then,
what's the business?

05:36.403 --> 05:39.473
How about no more questions, hmm?
Tonight's for catching up, man.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.808
- I'll lay everything out tomorrow.
- Come on, Jack.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.611
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

05:43.743 --> 05:45.179
You told me to come
all the way here

05:45.312 --> 05:47.481
- and you won't tell me anything?
- All right, fine.

05:47.615 --> 05:51.518
You'd be working
in acquisitions.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.188
- Acquisitions.
- Mm-hmm.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.856
- I like that.
- Good!

05:56.991 --> 05:58.158
Acquisitions.

05:58.292 --> 06:00.527
Yeah. And just know
that from now on,

06:00.661 --> 06:02.396
your troubles
are officially over.

06:04.131 --> 06:07.134
Thank you, man. Seriously.

06:07.268 --> 06:09.203
<i>Jack had always been
ahead of the curve,</i>

06:09.336 --> 06:12.072
<i>so I made it my goal to learn
all that I could from him.</i>

06:12.206 --> 06:16.143
<i>Lesson #1: It's all
about who you know.</i>

06:18.012 --> 06:19.680
Come on in.

06:19.812 --> 06:20.948
Drop your shit anywhere.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.150
Couch is all yours.

06:29.356 --> 06:30.624
Come on, let's go!

06:30.758 --> 06:33.727
- Where are we going?
- Downstairs.

06:33.860 --> 06:37.064
Man, you're really going to love
your co-workers. Guys, open up!

06:39.600 --> 06:41.868
- Jack, is that your truck?
- Yeah, one of them.

06:43.537 --> 06:46.940
Chill! Are you done?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.442
Yeah, I'm done.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.982
- I swear you're a child.
- Oh, don't act like you didn't miss me.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.051
Lance, this is Allie,
the lady of the house.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.485
- Hey, Lance.
- Hey.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.990
That's Stewart,
Chandler, and that's Ellis.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.525
- What's up, bro?
- Hey.

07:05.559 --> 07:06.994
Take a seat.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.595
Thank you.

07:11.864 --> 07:13.067
$500 buy-in.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.369
You in?

07:18.739 --> 07:22.810
Oh, no. Guys, I don't have 500
bucks to blow on a poker game.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.512
Jack says you're
joining us tomorrow.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.184
Yeah, he is.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.319
Just a trial period.

07:32.453 --> 07:35.855
Spot him the five, he's good for it.
Family, right?

07:40.294 --> 07:42.262
Jack, Jack...
where we going, man?

07:42.396 --> 07:44.031
Picking up and
moving a new piece.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.165
Why you looking like that?

07:45.299 --> 07:47.101
You trust me, right?
Come on.

07:53.240 --> 07:56.176
I hope you know art
like he says you do.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.178
Yeah.

07:59.646 --> 08:03.117
You know enough not to get your
clammy hands all over the art, right?

08:10.924 --> 08:14.027
Oh yeah, throw this on
before you get out.

08:19.566 --> 08:20.968
So, are you in or not?

08:24.772 --> 08:26.006
Yeah, I'm in.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.397
<i>I was absolutely speechless.</i>

08:53.600 --> 08:56.103
<i>I mean, they were breaking into
these homes in broad daylight,</i>

08:56.236 --> 08:58.071
<i>and they would just
make a sport out of it.</i>

08:58.205 --> 09:00.507
<i>They would steal
anything of value,</i>

09:00.641 --> 09:02.509
<i>and then just destroy
the rest for fun.</i>

09:02.643 --> 09:06.647
<i>I mean, these guys were
true artists of destruction.</i>

09:06.780 --> 09:09.450
<i>They could tear down what took
someone else years to build up.</i>

09:11.051 --> 09:12.453
<i>It's very poetic.</i>

09:12.586 --> 09:15.556
<i>But who were they?</i>

09:15.689 --> 09:18.459
<i>Let's start with Chandler
Gaines and Stewart Magenty.</i>

09:18.592 --> 09:20.394
<i>Chandler was
the getaway driver.</i>

09:20.527 --> 09:22.262
<i>He served a short stint
in Afghanistan that</i>

09:22.396 --> 09:24.131
<i>fucked him up pretty badly.</i>

09:24.264 --> 09:26.567
While some US veterans
thought they had left

09:26.700 --> 09:30.671
the worst of the war behind, only to
discover the war came home with them.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.207
<i>And he came home and
couldn't even find a factory job.</i>

09:33.340 --> 09:38.078
Twenty-six percent of vets between
the ages of 18 and 24 are out of work.

09:38.212 --> 09:40.147
<i>He felt
rejected and lost.</i>

09:40.280 --> 09:42.683
<i>Just around that time, he
got a call from an old buddy.</i>

09:46.753 --> 09:48.722
<i>Stewart was
the security expert:</i>

09:48.856 --> 09:51.926
<i>alarms, cameras, safes.
I mean, he could get past anything.</i>

09:52.059 --> 09:53.694
<i>He'd moved to Silicon Valley
with big dreams</i>

09:53.827 --> 09:55.964
<i>but learned the hard way
that most people don't make it.</i>

09:56.096 --> 09:58.565
<i>The unemployment
rate of the Silicon Valley area</i>

09:58.699 --> 10:01.401
<i>is 8.5% higher than
the national average.</i>

10:01.535 --> 10:03.437
<i>Then he got stuck
working in the nerd squad</i>

10:03.570 --> 10:05.472
<i>at one of those big
electronic chains.</i>

10:05.606 --> 10:07.875
<i>This may not be
the image that comes to mind</i>

10:08.008 --> 10:10.077
<i>when you think of Silicon
Valley, but it's a scene</i>

10:10.210 --> 10:12.412
<i>that's become
all too familiar here.</i>

10:12.546 --> 10:15.849
- What do you think it's worth, art major?
- <i>Next is Allie Tucker.</i>

10:15.984 --> 10:20.287
<i>She made sure the message was clear. She was
the glue that kept the whole group together.</i>

10:20.420 --> 10:22.089
<i>Her and Ellis started
dating in college,</i>

10:22.222 --> 10:23.423
<i>where they were
both activists.</i>

10:23.557 --> 10:25.359
- Occupy!
- Wall Street!

10:25.492 --> 10:27.962
- Occupy!
- Wall Street!

10:28.095 --> 10:30.397
<i>And at first, it
was just the two of them.</i>

10:30.531 --> 10:32.799
<i>Kind of a Bonnie and Clyde,
but with a message.</i>

10:32.934 --> 10:35.302
<i>Here is Clyde
Barrow and Bonnie Parker</i>

10:35.435 --> 10:37.972
<i>who died as they lived:
by the gun.</i>

10:38.105 --> 10:42.442
<i>We've got to win by
building a new civil rights movement</i>

10:42.576 --> 10:46.580
<i>that's prepared to fight
by any means necessary.</i>

10:46.713 --> 10:49.316
<i>And Ellis Beck
was the puppeteer.</i>

10:49.449 --> 10:54.321
<i>His philosophy was simple: Why try to work
for a system that's failed you so horribly?</i>

10:54.454 --> 10:57.357
The richest 1%
controls more wealth now

10:57.491 --> 10:59.961
than at any time in more
than a half century.

11:00.093 --> 11:03.564
<i>And he believed that we were
the wake-up call that the system needed.</i>

11:03.697 --> 11:06.233
<i>So, that's what they did,
and they did it well.</i>

11:06.366 --> 11:09.703
<i>They'd gotten away with it long enough
to get incredibly efficient at it.</i>

11:09.836 --> 11:14.808
<i>Lesson #2: When the system is
corrupt, why play by their rules?</i>

11:22.182 --> 11:24.451
- I got you.
- You got it?

11:26.720 --> 11:27.922
How long is the drive?

11:28.056 --> 11:29.556
45 minutes.

11:29.991 --> 11:31.224
Jack.

11:31.825 --> 11:32.859
Your cousin.

12:05.994 --> 12:07.361
Lance.

12:17.105 --> 12:18.605
Let's go, man.

12:34.421 --> 12:36.823
<i>And Mel Donnelly
is how they made money.</i>

12:36.958 --> 12:38.525
Where's the rest?

12:38.659 --> 12:40.861
We almost got
everything on your list.

12:42.896 --> 12:45.599
You got 15 minutes.

12:45.732 --> 12:49.971
<i>Mel owned a shipping container company
in the city, completely legit business.</i>

12:50.104 --> 12:52.839
<i>But every now and then,
he'd fill up one of those containers</i>

12:52.974 --> 12:55.342
<i>with stolen goods,
ship it overseas,</i>

12:55.475 --> 12:57.411
<i>and make an extremely
large amount of cash.</i>

12:57.544 --> 12:58.946
- Got it?
- Yep.

12:59.846 --> 13:01.214
Right there.

13:07.421 --> 13:09.389
There was supposed to be
a couple of Van Goghs

13:09.523 --> 13:11.025
and an emerald bracelet.

13:11.159 --> 13:13.593
- Just one Van Gogh.
- Just one?

13:13.727 --> 13:15.362
Yeah,
but the bracelet's in there,

13:15.495 --> 13:17.531
plus a few other things
that weren't listed.

13:17.664 --> 13:20.968
We also got the mail
and a couple of passports.

13:21.102 --> 13:22.335
Hmm.

13:24.105 --> 13:26.306
So, he's with you?

13:29.043 --> 13:30.210
Yeah.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.645
Does he know that?

13:31.778 --> 13:34.247
He's an art major,
helps us tell us what art

13:34.381 --> 13:35.515
is valuable and what's not.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.085
Plus we need the extra hand.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.685
He's cool, Mel.
He's my cousin.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.620
Oh, that's supposed
to make me feel better,

13:40.754 --> 13:42.656
that he fell out of
your family tree?

13:52.100 --> 13:53.333
Hello.

13:56.403 --> 13:58.005
What, you find me attractive?

13:59.539 --> 14:02.642
- I, what?
- Well, you won't look at me.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.878
That means either you're not
into what's going on here,

14:05.012 --> 14:07.814
or my good looks are
making you uncomfortable.

14:09.150 --> 14:10.184
The first.

14:10.317 --> 14:12.352
Uh-huh.

14:12.486 --> 14:16.857
You add someone without asking me and
bring him to my place of business?

14:16.991 --> 14:18.625
I didn't see anything.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.528
Oh, yeah, you did.

14:26.700 --> 14:29.003
You say one word to anyone...

14:30.871 --> 14:32.506
I dare you.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.376
<i>Comprende,</i> cousin?

14:50.557 --> 14:52.759
Here's another address,

14:52.893 --> 14:56.097
and a list of what I expect
you to find when you go there.

14:57.198 --> 14:59.066
<i>When you buy
homeowner's insurance,</i>

14:59.200 --> 15:02.702
<i>anything particularly valuable
has to be listed separately,</i>

15:03.938 --> 15:06.540
<i>photos, certificate of
authenticity, proof of purchase...</i>

15:06.673 --> 15:09.243
<i>so basically the insurance
companies know what everybody has.</i>

15:09.376 --> 15:10.610
Smile.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.681
<i>All you need is
one dirty agent and...</i>

15:14.815 --> 15:16.817
<i>and that's where
Mel comes in.</i>

15:18.351 --> 15:21.855
<i>Mel had a place to sell everything,
and he paid extremely well.</i>

15:21.989 --> 15:25.826
<i>Even with the smaller loads,
the mail usually made up the difference.</i>

15:25.960 --> 15:29.362
Yeah, well, I'll
round it up to 30K.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.967
But you better make it
up to me next time.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.269
<i>Credit cards,
social security numbers,</i>

15:35.402 --> 15:38.471
<i>bank account numbers...
and they all knew what he did with those.</i>

15:38.605 --> 15:40.107
What's your name?

15:41.408 --> 15:42.375
Lance.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.946
Lance? Lance what?

15:45.812 --> 15:46.948
Zutterland?

15:47.681 --> 15:49.449
Are you asking me?

15:50.985 --> 15:53.988
Don't show up here again unless
you're going to pull your weight.

15:58.159 --> 15:59.759
Lock it up when you're done.

16:10.604 --> 16:12.706
Aw, come on, man, really?

16:12.839 --> 16:14.175
Again?

16:14.308 --> 16:17.844
- Thirty split five ways is six.
- And we get four?

16:17.979 --> 16:20.614
You wouldn't know what to do with
this shit if it wasn't for my guy.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.816
And you couldn't do without us,
so fuck you.

16:22.950 --> 16:26.820
You know, we got eight minutes.
Let's wrap it up.

16:26.954 --> 16:27.989
Bullshit.

16:28.122 --> 16:29.623
Fucking piece
of shit.

16:32.826 --> 16:35.595
I'm sick of loading shit up.

16:35.729 --> 16:37.898
Yeah, yeah, I got it,
come on.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.835
What's wrong
with this guy?

16:41.969 --> 16:44.638
- I think we spooked him.
- He'll be fine.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.910
I get it,
but you wouldn't have come.

16:49.043 --> 16:50.912
Of course I wouldn't
have, that was fucked up!

16:51.045 --> 16:54.081
Okay, I don't want anything
to do with this, seriously.

16:58.986 --> 17:00.388
Here's your cut.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.058
Actually, half of mine. The guys
didn't think you deserved anything

17:04.191 --> 17:06.360
since you stood there with
your thumb up your ass.

17:06.493 --> 17:09.729
- But you're family, so I'm willing to cut you some slack.
- Cut me slack?

17:09.863 --> 17:13.533
I came all the way out here because you
told me you had a legit job offer for me.

17:13.667 --> 17:16.670
The family in the house we robbed? They're
the reason you can't get a legit job.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.572
- What are you talking about?
- You're focusing on the wrong part of this.

17:19.706 --> 17:22.742
Come out with us tonight.
I'll tell you what this is really about.

17:23.978 --> 17:25.879
- I know what this is really about.
- God, Lance,

17:26.013 --> 17:28.748
nobody is forcing you
to do it again, okay?

17:29.883 --> 17:31.919
Just stop, you got
a place to stay,

17:32.053 --> 17:34.288
couple bucks in your pocket to
help you look for a legit job.

17:34.422 --> 17:37.490
I'm not touching that money, Jack.
I don't want anything to do with this!

17:37.624 --> 17:38.725
- Okay, fine.
- I'm serious!

17:38.858 --> 17:39.961
Okay, I know you're serious.

17:40.094 --> 17:41.963
You don't have to
touch the money.

17:43.130 --> 17:44.564
Lance, come on, stop.

17:44.698 --> 17:46.033
Look at me.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.802
Hey...

17:51.138 --> 17:53.407
I'm sorry, okay?

17:53.540 --> 17:55.042
I should have told you.

17:56.110 --> 17:57.610
But it's done.

17:57.744 --> 18:01.082
You did it already, so you
might as well enjoy it.

18:01.215 --> 18:03.985
And plus, it's
cocktail night tonight.

18:04.118 --> 18:05.852
Kind of a big deal.

18:07.088 --> 18:09.256
- Come on.
- <i>Where did they take you?</i>

18:09.390 --> 18:11.292
<i>Where they went
after every heist.</i>

18:11.425 --> 18:14.428
- He okay?
- Yeah, he's fine. He's just shell-shocked.

18:14.561 --> 18:17.231
- He's with us, isn't he?
- Fucking better be after the shit he's seen.

18:17.365 --> 18:19.934
- Just do your pitch and reel him in.
- <i>They celebrated,</i>

18:20.067 --> 18:22.669
<i>and blowing through most of
what they made wasn't uncommon.</i>

18:22.802 --> 18:25.239
<i>I mean, their money didn't
go towards savings or 401(k)s.</i>

18:26.173 --> 18:28.242
<i>What did
they spend it on, then?</i>

18:28.909 --> 18:30.810
<i>Instant gratification.</i>

18:30.945 --> 18:32.980
<i>They thought the well
would never dry up.</i>

18:33.114 --> 18:35.916
<i>So, easy come, easy go.</i>

18:36.384 --> 18:37.418
<i>Exactly.</i>

18:40.087 --> 18:42.023
<i>Even though I said no to the
money, I did the math.</i>

18:42.156 --> 18:44.624
<i>It would have taken me
three weeks and two days</i>

18:44.758 --> 18:46.793
<i>working those 12-hour shifts
at an art gallery</i>

18:46.927 --> 18:49.629
<i>to make as much as what Jack had
offered me after the first hit.</i>

18:49.763 --> 18:51.531
<i>And they were doing
these a few times a week.</i>

18:51.664 --> 18:53.600
Hey, Lance, take a seat.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.705
Lance, I want to thank you
for entertaining all of us.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.142
What am I entertaining?

19:01.909 --> 19:04.278
How much do you owe
in student loans?

19:05.379 --> 19:06.414
$60,000.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.581
Fuck me. Wow.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.118
I owe $120,000.

19:11.252 --> 19:12.953
Why did you borrow?

19:13.087 --> 19:15.356
- What do you mean, why did I borrow?
- Why'd you borrow?

19:15.489 --> 19:17.724
Because I couldn't afford
school, that's what you do.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.826
What were your grades?

19:21.628 --> 19:23.164
3.8.

19:23.297 --> 19:24.664
Mine were 4.0.

19:24.798 --> 19:26.633
Don't you feel cheated?

19:26.766 --> 19:29.769
We fucking did everything
that they told us to do.

19:29.904 --> 19:32.572
We got the grades, we got
to the end of the line.

19:32.705 --> 19:33.706
For what?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.976
What was waiting there, hmm?

19:36.709 --> 19:38.546
Fucking nothing,
no bueno, no good.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.880
Nothing, no job.

19:41.015 --> 19:43.284
Yeah, but still,
you're stealing from people.

19:43.417 --> 19:44.952
Fuck the people.
Fuck 'em.

19:45.086 --> 19:48.688
The insurance company covers
what that shit is worth.

19:48.822 --> 19:50.757
They pay double for it.

19:51.959 --> 19:55.396
Listen, everybody knows very few
people have all the wealth,

19:55.529 --> 19:57.198
and they like to
keep it that way.

19:57.331 --> 20:00.367
Each generation it gets worse
and worse, ours being latest.

20:00.501 --> 20:03.938
We're not just stealing...
we're sending a message.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.008
Woo!

20:08.142 --> 20:10.277
Look at this.
Look at all that.

20:12.980 --> 20:15.583
Don't you think that you
deserve all of this?

20:15.715 --> 20:19.420
Don't you think that you
deserve all of this?

20:19.553 --> 20:22.323
Hey, take one
of these puppies.

20:27.428 --> 20:29.430
- Hey, come on.
- What is it?

20:29.563 --> 20:30.830
Our generation's
drug, man.

20:30.965 --> 20:32.665
Guarantee he's
not going to do it.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.068
Aw, give him a sec.

20:36.070 --> 20:40.174
<i>Lesson #3: Never
take no for an answer.</i>

20:40.307 --> 20:43.244
Hey, Lance,
welcome to cocktail night.

20:55.055 --> 20:56.890
Ever done this
before, Lancey-pansey?

20:57.024 --> 20:59.160
So, you do it
through your eye.

20:59.293 --> 21:01.929
How do you get that clean line?
I can never do a fucking clean line.

21:02.062 --> 21:04.231
You've always been sloppy.

21:04.365 --> 21:06.833
I got to do it for Lance.
This is all you, baby boy.

21:06.967 --> 21:08.302
It won't work, man!

21:08.435 --> 21:09.736
Nah, he's fine.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.238
Have I got it on
my face still?

21:11.372 --> 21:12.705
Big one. Oh!

21:12.839 --> 21:15.509
A good time, huh?

21:15.643 --> 21:19.079
You guys want to stay in here longer?
It smells great. Let's go.

21:20.281 --> 21:21.881
<i>I wasn't sure
if I was sold on what</i>

21:22.016 --> 21:24.318
<i>Ellis was saying yet,
but I did know this:</i>

21:24.451 --> 21:28.088
<i>for once in my life, I felt
like I was part of something.</i>

21:28.222 --> 21:31.091
<i>I wasn't the outsider
anymore, I was accepted.</i>

21:31.225 --> 21:32.993
<i>We blew through most of
that money that night,</i>

21:33.127 --> 21:35.329
<i>but for a moment,
we were kings.</i>

21:36.430 --> 21:41.235
<i>Lesson #4: Experiences are
better than bank statements.</i>

22:24.078 --> 22:27.348
<i>By the time the money ran out, they were
already gearing up for the next hit.</i>

22:27.481 --> 22:29.283
<i>And as reckless as
the hits seemed,</i>

22:29.416 --> 22:31.685
<i>they were actually thought
out pretty carefully.</i>

22:31.818 --> 22:35.489
<i>Like the truck... I mean,
they ordered six or seven sample decals</i>

22:35.623 --> 22:38.192
<i>just so that they would change
them from one hit to the next.</i>

22:38.325 --> 22:40.494
<i>Eyewitnesses and street
cameras were less likely</i>

22:40.628 --> 22:42.429
<i>to ID the same truck.</i>

22:47.201 --> 22:49.536
<i>And the truck's license plates
were another thing.</i>

22:49.670 --> 22:53.207
<i>How many people actually know their
license plate numbers by heart?</i>

22:53.340 --> 22:56.277
<i>Most wouldn't even notice until
next time they were at the DMV.</i>

23:05.653 --> 23:07.955
<i>And if someone sees a shitty
car in a nice neighborhood,</i>

23:08.088 --> 23:10.357
<i>I mean, someone's
going to be suspicious.</i>

23:10.491 --> 23:12.993
<i>But a nice car in
a nice neighborhood?</i>

23:13.661 --> 23:15.362
<i>No one thinks twice.</i>

23:16.563 --> 23:18.299
<i>After Mel gave
them the address,</i>

23:18.432 --> 23:20.567
<i>they'd spend a day
or two casing the place,</i>

23:20.701 --> 23:23.237
<i>making sure they knew when
the homeowners left for work,</i>

23:23.370 --> 23:26.740
<i>when the maid showed up, when the
husband came home with his mistress.</i>

23:26.873 --> 23:28.375
<i>All the good stuff.</i>

23:30.010 --> 23:33.213
<i>Once Jack laid this all out for me,
I realized he actually had a point.</i>

23:33.347 --> 23:37.384
<i>They'd been doing this for a while without
getting caught, and the money was good.</i>

23:37.518 --> 23:41.555
<i>All I had to do was put
away my moral objections.</i>

23:41.689 --> 23:44.191
<i>You know, Lance,
you're a pretty good kid.</i>

23:44.325 --> 23:46.760
And I'd like to offer
you a job, minimum wage.

23:46.893 --> 23:48.895
You're not going to
get rich doing this.

23:49.029 --> 23:52.933
But if you stick to it, you're going
to learn a lot about the art world.

23:53.067 --> 23:55.436
And there's a lot
of room to grow.

23:55.569 --> 24:00.007
You just need to focus,
get involved, learn what you can,

24:00.140 --> 24:03.177
and this is a great place
for you to begin.

24:16.123 --> 24:19.226
<i>The masks were the
final touch to their message,</i>

24:19.360 --> 24:23.330
<i>that they'd rather be dead
than submit to the system.</i>

24:24.164 --> 24:26.100
<i>When Lance
decided to join,</i>

24:26.233 --> 24:28.802
<i>I knew then that
he would never fit our mold.</i>

24:28.936 --> 24:32.239
<i>Honestly, he was
the hardest to figure out.</i>

24:33.474 --> 24:34.808
What does that mean?

24:34.942 --> 24:37.311
Welcome to
the group, baby boy.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.615
Yo, Slim, pull me up.

24:44.518 --> 24:46.120
Well...

24:47.588 --> 24:50.557
what you go for first
says everything about you.

24:51.558 --> 24:57.030
<i>You go for the furniture,
pictures, Dad's golf trophies,</i>

24:57.164 --> 24:59.099
<i>Mommy's wine set.</i>

24:59.233 --> 25:01.368
<i>Everyone had their own thing.</i>

25:02.669 --> 25:04.471
<i>Stewart always went
for the glass.</i>

25:04.605 --> 25:09.977
He liked to think of himself
as a bull in a china shop.

25:10.911 --> 25:13.680
Stewart got picked
on a lot as a kid.

25:15.349 --> 25:17.518
<i>He wasn't a bull at all.</i>

25:17.651 --> 25:19.186
<i>He was just...</i>

25:19.686 --> 25:21.121
<i>insecure.</i>

25:26.593 --> 25:29.463
<i>Jack had this thing
for family pictures.</i>

25:30.297 --> 25:32.900
<i>He couldn't stand them.</i>

25:33.033 --> 25:35.969
<i>Especially
the fake happy ones.</i>

25:49.383 --> 25:51.852
<i>Jack had mommy
and daddy issues.</i>

25:52.853 --> 25:54.855
<i>They didn't give a shit
about his businesses.</i>

25:54.988 --> 25:57.958
<i>They didn't even visit him once
since he moved to Chicago.</i>

26:07.334 --> 26:10.204
<i>He felt neglected
and abandoned.</i>

26:13.207 --> 26:15.976
<i>When he was destroying
someone else's life...</i>

26:18.779 --> 26:21.181
<i>I think he felt in control.</i>

26:25.185 --> 26:28.755
<i>Chandler hated seeing
a kid's room full of toys.</i>

26:32.659 --> 26:36.697
<i>Chandler had nothing as
a kid except maybe a beating</i>

26:36.830 --> 26:40.133
<i>from his dad when he got
drunk and pissed off that</i>

26:40.267 --> 26:42.302
<i>he couldn't provide
for his family.</i>

26:45.105 --> 26:49.710
<i>Breaking into someone's house
would make anyone feel violated.</i>

26:51.044 --> 26:53.046
<i>But messing with
a kid's room...</i>

26:54.882 --> 26:57.784
<i>that's what messed the parents up
the most when they'd come home.</i>

27:14.835 --> 27:16.503
That shit was fucked up.

27:20.274 --> 27:22.509
<i>Ellis never knew his parents.</i>

27:22.643 --> 27:26.480
<i>He went from foster home to
foster home until he turned 18.</i>

27:27.015 --> 27:28.582
<i>He always wanted a family.</i>

27:28.715 --> 27:30.584
<i>And because of that,</i>

27:30.717 --> 27:33.554
<i>he was the thread that
brought them all together.</i>

27:33.687 --> 27:37.658
<i>He gave this group of misfits
something to believe in.</i>

27:38.625 --> 27:42.629
<i>For me, I couldn't stand
the vanity of it all.</i>

27:43.697 --> 27:46.433
<i>Cologne, perfume, suits,
dresses, makeup,</i>

27:46.567 --> 27:48.002
<i>Tom Ford, Gucci, Prada.</i>

27:48.135 --> 27:51.204
<i>More and more excess, excess.</i>

27:54.741 --> 27:59.446
You said that Lance
was hardest to figure out.

28:00.714 --> 28:01.748
<i>Why?</i>

28:03.317 --> 28:07.154
<i>He didn't fit in, because he
wasn't scarred by his past like the others.</i>

28:07.287 --> 28:11.758
<i>He was just someone who had followed
the rules and got screwed over.</i>

28:13.627 --> 28:18.131
<i>In a way, he understood Ellis'
ideas better than anyone.</i>

28:19.299 --> 28:21.835
<i>So, when he had
the chance to destroy,</i>

28:22.469 --> 28:24.738
<i>he saw it as an art form.</i>

28:30.210 --> 28:31.278
<i>It had meaning.</i>

28:36.951 --> 28:40.387
<i>I think most people deep down
want to do what we did.</i>

28:40.520 --> 28:42.957
<i>But Lance let
himself go all-in.</i>

28:43.091 --> 28:44.791
<i>It became his addiction.</i>

28:46.393 --> 28:50.230
<i>The excitement, the thrill.</i>

28:50.897 --> 28:52.633
<i>He loved it.</i>

29:42.582 --> 29:46.353
<i>When I finally gave in, it was one
of the greatest feelings I've ever had.</i>

29:46.486 --> 29:48.156
<i>I remember looking
up at that house,</i>

29:48.321 --> 29:51.458
<i>and as it towered over me
it made me feel so small.</i>

29:51.591 --> 29:53.894
<i>And that's how the people who
live there wanted me to feel.</i>

29:54.028 --> 29:57.698
<i>And I realized that's
why they deserved this.</i>

29:58.598 --> 30:01.868
<i>Lesson #5... you know what,
actually, fuck that.</i>

30:02.003 --> 30:04.504
<i>They weren't lessons
anymore, they were rules.</i>

30:04.638 --> 30:10.444
<i>Rule #5: If they won't let us
dream, we won't let them sleep.</i>

30:21.055 --> 30:23.423
<i>I don't know what I was
feeling at that point.</i>

30:23.557 --> 30:25.492
<i>I just know it felt right.</i>

30:34.735 --> 30:36.570
<i>Maybe we were all in
it for different reasons,</i>

30:36.703 --> 30:39.339
<i>but for me it was about
the rush, the high.</i>

30:39.473 --> 30:41.341
- <i>It all felt like...</i>
- Stop!

30:42.409 --> 30:44.277
Bring that over here.

30:51.485 --> 30:53.320
Someone want to explain this?

30:53.453 --> 30:56.157
Must have ripped
when we were loading it.

30:56.289 --> 30:58.592
I'm sorry, is that
your explanation?

31:00.228 --> 31:01.828
Hey, Zutterland.

31:03.330 --> 31:04.966
What's this worth?

31:05.799 --> 31:07.969
I mean, it's
insured for probably 100K.

31:08.102 --> 31:09.336
Could flip it for around 60?

31:09.469 --> 31:14.441
Yeah. What's it worth now?

31:14.574 --> 31:16.043
Probably cost
more to repair it

31:16.177 --> 31:17.410
than what it's actually worth.

31:17.544 --> 31:19.546
So, nothing, right?

31:22.582 --> 31:24.618
Lance, let's talk.

31:42.904 --> 31:47.275
You know, you're
part of this now.

31:47.407 --> 31:50.945
Plausible deniability
was over two houses ago.

31:52.013 --> 31:53.580
Yeah, I understand that.

31:54.514 --> 31:56.650
Take a look at me,
tell me what you see.

31:57.851 --> 31:59.053
A businessman.

31:59.187 --> 32:01.956
Someone 20 years
older than you.

32:02.089 --> 32:06.693
I lead a comfortable life, but I have
a lot less left of it than you do.

32:06.827 --> 32:08.029
So...

32:08.162 --> 32:10.697
So you don't want to spend
what's left of it in a cell.

32:10.831 --> 32:15.036
Exactly.
It's about risk, reward.

32:15.169 --> 32:18.438
All that aside, I'm sure you alone
amongst your cohorts over there

32:18.572 --> 32:21.708
might have a little compassion for
that piece of destroyed history,

32:21.842 --> 32:26.613
so I want to ask you to help
me keep these kids in line.

32:28.481 --> 32:30.117
Can you do that for me?

32:33.054 --> 32:34.421
Yes, sir.

32:34.956 --> 32:35.990
Great.

32:37.325 --> 32:39.459
You don't got
to call me sir.

32:42.896 --> 32:46.666
This is 20K
and another address.

32:51.571 --> 32:54.708
You think your old man
ever held 20K in his hand?

32:56.776 --> 32:57.510
No.

32:57.644 --> 33:00.014
Yeah, me neither.

33:02.616 --> 33:04.018
You know what?

33:04.151 --> 33:05.953
Don't tell them what I said.

33:07.188 --> 33:09.556
- You know they're going to ask.
- Oh, of course they will.

33:09.689 --> 33:12.492
But, you see, that's what I'm doing,
I'm giving you the upper hand.

33:12.626 --> 33:14.195
I'm giving you a secret.

33:14.328 --> 33:16.863
You got to keep it from
them, see what happens.

33:26.439 --> 33:27.641
Another address, Mel?

33:27.774 --> 33:29.509
Yeah, I gave it to Lance.

33:30.177 --> 33:31.678
Cut rate for the ripped art.

33:31.811 --> 33:34.015
When you're finished, get out.

33:34.148 --> 33:36.117
You bring me a piece in
that condition again,

33:36.250 --> 33:37.985
we're done here,
you hear me?

33:48.162 --> 33:49.462
<i>What did Mel say?</i>

33:49.596 --> 33:51.431
Told you, dude,
he said it's a secret.

33:51.564 --> 33:53.600
Ah, man,
he just playing you.

33:53.733 --> 33:56.137
He told me the same thing
when I first came on.

33:56.270 --> 33:58.438
Just another reason why
this shit won't last.

34:01.309 --> 34:03.177
Luckily, I got a way out.

34:04.111 --> 34:05.413
What did you just say?

34:05.545 --> 34:06.981
I said, this
isn't going to last.

34:07.114 --> 34:08.983
But what I'm saying
is I have a way out.

34:09.116 --> 34:11.252
Mel isn't the only one that's
been buying addresses

34:11.385 --> 34:12.585
from that insurance agent.

34:12.719 --> 34:14.322
Ellis bought their
most expensive client.

34:14.454 --> 34:18.491
Some paranoid old fuck sitting
on an ungodly amount of cash.

34:18.625 --> 34:20.860
- Cash?
- Enough to last a lifetime.

34:20.995 --> 34:23.763
Ellis only sees it as
a last resort kind of thing.

34:23.897 --> 34:26.233
That's why my plan is
to hit it without him.

34:26.367 --> 34:27.634
Without Ellis.

34:28.702 --> 34:30.537
Without anybody.

34:31.405 --> 34:33.207
What are you
talking about, Jack?

34:33.341 --> 34:36.509
We have something good going here.
Why do you want to screw this all up?

34:36.643 --> 34:38.346
What is good about
Ellis getting more money

34:38.478 --> 34:40.982
than us on every house, hmm?

34:41.115 --> 34:43.317
We don't have to do this today,
but we got to get his phone

34:43.451 --> 34:45.419
and the pictures so we're
ready when the time comes.

34:45.552 --> 34:48.289
Jack, you're saying "we" like
I'm already a part of this.

34:48.422 --> 34:51.158
This is us having enough money to
get out of here before it's too late.

34:51.292 --> 34:54.228
No, this is us completely
fucking everybody else over!

34:55.162 --> 34:57.098
Man, I thought these guys
were your best friends.

34:57.231 --> 34:59.433
You made this huge deal of
introducing them all to me

34:59.566 --> 35:01.002
saying how much
I would love them and...

35:01.135 --> 35:03.904
These guys do not give
a shit about friends.

35:04.504 --> 35:06.374
They just don't.

35:06.506 --> 35:08.909
All right, Jack, no more bullshit.
What do you want from me?

35:09.043 --> 35:11.811
Am I here because you guys want
to use me for my art expertise?

35:11.946 --> 35:14.181
Do you want me so you can fuck
over your friends? What is it?

35:14.315 --> 35:16.649
Because you have not been
honest with me since I got here.

35:16.783 --> 35:18.452
I'm being honest
with you right now.

35:18.585 --> 35:21.489
These guys think you're some art
kid who likes doing weird shit,

35:21.654 --> 35:23.757
who likes going to
his little theater plays

35:23.890 --> 35:25.359
and his little art galleries.

35:25.493 --> 35:27.894
You don't owe them anything.

35:28.895 --> 35:30.264
I'm looking out for you.

35:30.398 --> 35:32.967
It is just you and me on this.

35:34.301 --> 35:35.903
I don't know, man.

35:41.409 --> 35:43.543
All right,
all right, throw them down.

35:43.676 --> 35:45.612
Oh, throwing it
down big, baby boy.

35:45.745 --> 35:47.348
- What you got?
- Throw 'em down.

35:47.481 --> 35:49.649
- Pair of threes.
- Oh!

35:49.783 --> 35:52.053
- Almost, baby boy, almost.
- So confident.

35:52.186 --> 35:54.388
We should go...
Caitlyn's always on time.

35:54.522 --> 35:56.123
No, think
I'm going to stay.

35:56.257 --> 35:57.690
I already told them
you were coming.

35:57.824 --> 35:59.559
Plus if you go,
you lose big.

35:59.692 --> 36:00.961
You should take Lance.

36:03.763 --> 36:07.567
What, he hasn't left my apartment since
he got here. You should take Lance.

36:08.335 --> 36:09.602
That okay with you?

36:09.736 --> 36:12.173
Yeah, I mean, you'd be
doing him a favor.

36:12.306 --> 36:16.310
Lance, you want to come hang out
with me and my old college friends.

36:16.444 --> 36:19.879
Nah, I'm all right.
And it'd be kind of weird, right?

36:22.383 --> 36:24.784
Why would it be weird? Hmm?

36:24.919 --> 36:27.988
- No, I was saying that...
- It'd only be weird if there was something

36:28.122 --> 36:30.657
- going on between you two.
- Oh, my God.

36:31.825 --> 36:33.893
Is there something
going on between you two?

36:34.028 --> 36:36.663
- No, there's nothing...
- You're stuttering on your fucking words

36:36.796 --> 36:40.201
- like there's something going on. Hang on.
- Sounds like there might be...

36:41.368 --> 36:43.037
Are you sure?

36:43.170 --> 36:45.973
- This is fucking stupid.
- Oh, he's getting a little red in the face.

36:46.107 --> 36:47.740
You got a little
boner going on there?

36:47.874 --> 36:50.010
- He's got a little boner.
- We're all friends here.

36:50.144 --> 36:51.979
If we can't trust each
other, who can you trust?

36:52.113 --> 36:53.914
- Just go with her, come on.
- You should go.

36:54.048 --> 36:56.117
Because if you're not,
I might go. Is that cool?

36:56.250 --> 36:59.019
- You're not invited.
- Is that cool, Ellis, can I go?

36:59.153 --> 37:01.255
You're not worried about me, are you?

37:01.388 --> 37:04.125
- Just go. We're all friends, go on.
- All right, I'll go.

37:04.258 --> 37:07.027
- Yeah! All right.
- Let's go.

37:07.161 --> 37:09.696
- See you back later?
- See you back later.

37:09.829 --> 37:11.065
I hope this is good with you.

37:11.198 --> 37:13.200
I'm in need,
in definite need.

37:13.334 --> 37:16.137
- Wait, who's small, who's big?
- I think you are.

37:16.270 --> 37:18.205
<i>I haven't talked
to Caitlyn in a while,</i>

37:18.339 --> 37:20.807
so when she called
I was really curious

37:20.941 --> 37:22.742
to see what she's been up to.

37:23.410 --> 37:25.012
Why has it
been so long?

37:25.678 --> 37:27.281
We're into
different things.

37:27.881 --> 37:29.617
- Hi! How are you?
- Hey.

37:29.749 --> 37:32.785
- This is Lance. Ellis got tied up.
- Hi. We have a table.

37:32.920 --> 37:36.323
- Nothing prepares you for how much work it is having a kid.
- It's worth it.

37:36.457 --> 37:38.791
- I forgot to show you Tibet.
- My God, this is beautiful.

37:38.926 --> 37:41.661
That looks like
a village we stayed at in Haiti.

37:41.794 --> 37:43.830
I jumped into the start-up
right after...

37:43.964 --> 37:46.400
It's not exactly a dream job
yet, but we're getting there.

37:50.070 --> 37:51.871
What about you, Allie?

37:52.373 --> 37:53.607
Um...

37:53.740 --> 37:57.211
Where do I even start?

37:58.845 --> 38:01.881
Africa, mostly.

38:02.016 --> 38:06.020
I got a group of ten investors
together to help develop

38:06.153 --> 38:08.255
an affordable option
for clean water.

38:08.389 --> 38:09.990
That's amazing!

38:10.823 --> 38:12.226
How about you, Lance?

38:12.725 --> 38:14.094
I own an art gallery.

38:14.228 --> 38:17.298
Okay, I know I took it
a little bit far, but I had to.

38:17.431 --> 38:19.133
Didn't you hear all
the stuff they're doing?

38:19.266 --> 38:22.036
- They only told you the good stuff.
- What?

38:22.169 --> 38:25.072
They only told you the good stuff.
No one actually tells you

38:25.206 --> 38:27.274
what they're really
doing in life.

38:28.209 --> 38:30.377
You're probably as close
to the truth as they were.

38:30.511 --> 38:32.379
It didn't seem that way.

38:33.447 --> 38:35.882
Hey, what about that art
gallery that you own, then?

38:36.016 --> 38:38.785
Oh, come on, you started it.

38:46.060 --> 38:47.760
How was it?

38:48.996 --> 38:50.797
Where is everyone?

38:50.931 --> 38:52.765
They just left.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.268
What's up?

38:56.604 --> 38:58.505
- Thanks for hanging out.
- Yeah.

38:58.639 --> 39:00.174
You going
back to Jack's?

39:00.307 --> 39:02.910
Yeah, I think I'm
going to call a cab right now.

39:03.344 --> 39:04.777
Thanks again.

39:13.886 --> 39:16.823
Hey, Lance, take a seat.

39:16.957 --> 39:18.392
Nah, man, I'm going
to go back to Jack's.

39:18.525 --> 39:20.461
No, no, no, take a seat.

39:20.594 --> 39:23.464
We can talk about what we
spoke about the other night.

39:25.165 --> 39:26.233
Okay.

39:27.701 --> 39:29.536
You know, uh...

39:32.306 --> 39:34.141
I didn't think that you
were going to make it.

39:34.275 --> 39:38.078
But you, you seem all right.

39:38.212 --> 39:40.481
I think that when you learn
where to stick your nose,

39:40.614 --> 39:45.085
and where not to, I think
you'll be a good fit.

39:47.021 --> 39:48.989
- Thanks.
- Mm.

39:49.123 --> 39:51.558
What did Mel say
to you the other day?

39:53.227 --> 39:56.430
Ah, nothing. I think he was
just trying to size me up.

39:57.398 --> 39:58.465
Okay.

40:02.336 --> 40:09.410
You know, if Allie ever asks
you to go to a club or a bar...

40:10.544 --> 40:12.346
or get her fucking mail...

40:13.047 --> 40:15.015
you say no, okay?

40:16.383 --> 40:18.885
Yeah. I got it.

40:19.019 --> 40:20.521
I honestly didn't
mean anything by it.

40:20.654 --> 40:22.723
I don't give a fuck
if you meant anything by it.

40:22.889 --> 40:24.958
Just make sure it
doesn't happen again.

40:25.693 --> 40:26.960
Yeah.

40:31.699 --> 40:32.933
Well, if you
got nothing to say,

40:33.067 --> 40:35.135
get the fuck out
of my apartment.

40:39.839 --> 40:44.945
<i>Rule #6: There's a thin
line between a friend and an enemy.</i>

40:48.182 --> 40:50.984
See what I mean about Ellis?
Not your fucking friend.

40:51.118 --> 40:54.321
But still, it doesn't
justify us doing this hit.

40:56.657 --> 40:57.658
Look at that guy.

40:57.791 --> 41:00.227
Middle-aged, wife, two kids.

41:00.361 --> 41:03.931
Had a nice job, but then, boom,
the economy crashes, loses his job.

41:04.064 --> 41:07.301
And now he's stuck getting me refills
and asking me how I'd like my steak.

41:07.434 --> 41:08.769
Why?

41:08.901 --> 41:11.238
Because he didn't
have a backup plan.

41:12.439 --> 41:14.441
Can I get
that out of your way?

41:18.412 --> 41:21.148
What suggests to you in any
way that I'm done with my food?

41:21.281 --> 41:22.950
Does it look like
I'm fucking done?

41:23.083 --> 41:24.451
Well, you
pointed at me.

41:24.585 --> 41:27.588
Uh-uh. Do you still
see food on my plate?

41:27.721 --> 41:28.756
Jack, come on, man.

41:28.922 --> 41:30.357
You can answer, I'll wait.

41:30.491 --> 41:34.995
- You're right. My mistake.
- Yeah, your mistake.

41:35.129 --> 41:37.831
It isn't just a steak,
this is an experience.

41:37.965 --> 41:40.167
An experience you
just fucking ruined.

41:40.300 --> 41:42.469
Get your fucking
shit together, man.

41:45.439 --> 41:47.141
You don't need
to talk to someone like that.

41:47.274 --> 41:49.777
I'm sorry, okay. Just listen.
It's all a lesson.

41:49.910 --> 41:52.780
I'm trying to tell you what's going
to happen to you if we don't do this.

41:52.913 --> 41:55.215
Forget about the waiter.
I'll give him a nice big tip.

41:55.349 --> 41:59.219
What's important is getting the
pictures off of Ellis' phone.

42:00.087 --> 42:02.089
I guess it couldn't
hurt to have those photos.

42:02.222 --> 42:05.125
Okay. So you're in? I'm only telling
you this shit because we're family.

42:05.259 --> 42:08.929
All right, listen, this is what I'm going to do for you.

42:09.062 --> 42:13.000
I'm going to do the same thing I did
for me when I got my first big paycheck.

42:13.133 --> 42:15.702
- And what's that?
- You'll see.

42:16.770 --> 42:19.273
This suit was crafted
in Florence, Italy.

42:19.406 --> 42:23.076
- One of our best.
- Mm. How's it feel?

42:23.210 --> 42:25.746
- I mean, it fits.
- We'll take it.

42:25.879 --> 42:27.381
<i>Rule #7...</i>

42:27.514 --> 42:30.484
The best things
in life are expensive.

42:30.919 --> 42:32.152
Remember that.

42:33.987 --> 42:38.225
Your total
is $6,348.52.

42:48.937 --> 42:50.337
You made coffee?

42:52.539 --> 42:53.707
No.

42:55.242 --> 42:56.977
I've been thinking.

42:59.246 --> 43:01.348
I don't want to
do this anymore.

43:04.451 --> 43:07.254
It's not rewarding,
it's unsustainable.

43:08.455 --> 43:10.224
Where is
this coming from?

43:11.058 --> 43:13.760
We don't have a plan
for us either, Ellis.

43:13.894 --> 43:18.298
I feel like I'm wasting any
potential that I might have had.

43:19.867 --> 43:21.635
You don't think
I have a plan.

43:22.236 --> 43:23.905
I've been saving up.

43:24.037 --> 43:25.706
And not a small amount, either.

43:25.839 --> 43:28.575
This is not the end result.

43:28.709 --> 43:33.714
Every time we do a hit,
I see everything I love about you.

43:36.850 --> 43:38.552
Stick with me, okay?

43:39.586 --> 43:41.655
We're not that
far from the end.

43:48.795 --> 43:50.364
Allie, you're late.

44:23.830 --> 44:25.666
Hey, guess what I found?

44:27.701 --> 44:31.672
"It appears to be the work
of the same band of youths,

44:31.805 --> 44:35.809
leaving a message in
their wake of discontent.

44:37.244 --> 44:42.249
Could this possibly be the built up
anger from the Millennial generation?"

44:45.285 --> 44:48.355
Can anyone tell me why
writing this load of crap

44:48.488 --> 44:51.625
on a kitchen wall
is a total waste of time?

44:54.328 --> 44:56.730
You accomplish nothing by
destroying these places.

44:56.863 --> 45:00.801
The only thing you're doing is
establishing a pattern, a calling card.

45:00.935 --> 45:04.471
A calling card that's gonna help
the police hone you down to:

45:04.605 --> 45:09.077
"The suspects are believed to be
in the age range of 18 to 29."

45:09.209 --> 45:10.711
Mel, we get it.

45:12.013 --> 45:14.548
You get it? Good. Good.

45:14.681 --> 45:17.851
So, now how many of you
still feel the need to make

45:17.986 --> 45:19.620
these brave statements?

45:25.792 --> 45:28.228
Well, are you
guys going to answer him?

45:29.596 --> 45:31.732
Come on, this is
what you sold me on.

45:32.833 --> 45:34.901
Yes, Mel, we have
to make our point.

45:36.136 --> 45:38.538
Well, let me tell you what your
points are going to get you.

45:38.672 --> 45:40.707
While you're out making
these statements, the police...

45:40.841 --> 45:43.276
Mel, you just told me
how you wanted me

45:43.410 --> 45:45.445
to get these guys
on track, right?

45:46.546 --> 45:48.382
If you want
us to stay in line,

45:48.515 --> 45:50.884
you got to give
us our freedom.

45:51.019 --> 45:52.954
It's what makes it fun.

45:53.787 --> 45:55.455
Well, then there's
good news and bad news.

45:55.589 --> 45:58.692
You can keep doing it.
You can keep having your fun.

45:58.825 --> 46:01.662
But the bad news is your
little trail of destruction

46:01.795 --> 46:04.531
is leading back to my guy
who's giving us this info,

46:04.665 --> 46:08.869
so he's decided he will no longer
supply us with the addresses.

46:09.503 --> 46:12.205
That's on you,
from now on.

46:18.745 --> 46:19.780
Fuck.

46:22.849 --> 46:24.551
Any of you guys
have an idea on an address?

46:24.685 --> 46:26.319
Just stay in
your fucking lane.

46:27.287 --> 46:30.158
I got a guy who caters
to high-end events...

46:30.323 --> 46:32.325
business events,
charity and shit.

46:32.459 --> 46:33.794
He can get us in.

46:33.928 --> 46:36.263
Okay, so what do
we do when we get there?

46:44.571 --> 46:45.907
<i>Act like them.</i>

46:46.873 --> 46:48.809
<i>With a drink in hand,
but don't get fucked up.</i>

46:48.943 --> 46:51.445
<i>Try and find the guy in the
room that everyone's talking to.</i>

46:51.578 --> 46:53.513
<i>Then you get your addresses.</i>

46:54.581 --> 46:56.550
<i>Thinking about moving
somewhere out of the city.</i>

46:56.683 --> 46:59.921
Somewhere peaceful.
Where did you say you lived again?

47:05.525 --> 47:08.729
<i>It was funny how many people
acted like they knew who we were.</i>

47:08.862 --> 47:11.364
<i>And we consistently got asked
the same question every time.</i>

47:11.498 --> 47:13.034
- What department you in?
- Accounting.

47:13.167 --> 47:14.701
- Accounting.
- Part of accounting.

47:14.835 --> 47:16.369
- I work in accounting.
- Accounting.

47:16.503 --> 47:18.338
Accounting, huh? You boys
keeping us in line?

47:18.472 --> 47:20.407
Yeah, that's what we do.

47:39.760 --> 47:41.328
Yeah, I used to
be afraid of numbers.

47:41.461 --> 47:43.030
I dabble in
a bit of charity work.

47:43.164 --> 47:44.198
I'm a philanthropist.

47:44.331 --> 47:45.332
If you'll excuse me,

47:45.465 --> 47:47.101
I need to step out for a moment.

47:58.045 --> 48:00.248
Thinking about moving out of the
city, somewhere more quiet.

48:00.380 --> 48:03.583
- Any suggestions?
- Well, I live in South Barrington, off Bosworth.

48:03.717 --> 48:05.619
<i>Biggest house on the block.</i>

48:05.752 --> 48:09.656
New sound system,
custom-made drapery from Spain.

48:09.790 --> 48:12.960
<i>One of the most beautiful
pools I've ever seen.</i>

48:19.033 --> 48:20.134
Fuck you!

48:51.364 --> 48:52.399
Ah fuck.

48:54.936 --> 48:56.570
- Oh, shit.
- <i>Guys,</i>

48:56.703 --> 48:58.139
<i>we have a serious problem
outside.</i>

48:58.272 --> 48:59.606
Fuck.

49:02.043 --> 49:03.144
Greetings!

49:03.277 --> 49:04.477
How you doing?

49:04.611 --> 49:07.014
Ah, so, what's going on?

49:07.148 --> 49:10.051
Ah, the mister
is moving out.

49:10.184 --> 49:11.418
- The mister?
- Yeah.

49:11.551 --> 49:13.887
- Got a name?
- Oh.

49:16.489 --> 49:17.757
Mr. Stan Lieberman.

49:17.891 --> 49:18.859
Ah.

49:18.993 --> 49:20.427
- Is he home?
- No.

49:20.560 --> 49:24.664
I'm thinking he's afraid
of being here right now.

49:24.798 --> 49:27.801
We were warned to clear out,
too, in case the wife comes home.

49:27.935 --> 49:31.272
Oh. They seemed
like such a nice couple.

49:31.404 --> 49:34.141
- She was too nice, from what I heard.
- What does that mean?

49:34.275 --> 49:37.611
You ever see any guys come
around here during the day?

49:39.546 --> 49:41.615
Wow. Uh...

49:41.748 --> 49:43.483
that doesn't sound like Linda.

49:43.617 --> 49:45.619
You can call Mr. Lieberman
if you want confirmation.

49:45.752 --> 49:48.322
Not about the fact that she was
screwing everything in sight,

49:48.455 --> 49:50.523
because you'll have me
in the shit for that.

49:50.657 --> 49:52.059
But about the move.

49:52.626 --> 49:54.694
- Poor Stan.
- Yeah.

49:54.828 --> 49:56.964
Yeah. You think
you know somebody.

49:57.098 --> 49:59.233
Wow! Yeah.

49:59.367 --> 50:01.035
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

50:03.037 --> 50:04.804
<i>Guys, we
got to leave now.</i>

50:07.341 --> 50:10.644
<i>Despite some close calls,
our plan was working great.</i>

50:10.777 --> 50:14.081
<i>Mel was still paying us, and we were
getting to do everything our own way.</i>

50:14.215 --> 50:16.716
<i>As far as I was concerned,
we could do this forever.</i>

50:16.850 --> 50:19.452
<i>I had hoped Jack would see this
for himself and forget about</i>

50:19.586 --> 50:22.123
<i>his whole backup plan,
but if anything,</i>

50:22.256 --> 50:23.523
<i>it just encouraged him more.</i>

50:23.657 --> 50:25.393
Not bad, huh, Mel?

50:25.525 --> 50:28.329
I mean, this shit's just as good as
anything you would ask for, right?

50:28.461 --> 50:31.798
The insurance guy, he was just getting
in the way, being too complicated.

50:31.933 --> 50:34.368
But, this?
This is airtight.

50:34.501 --> 50:36.904
What do you want,
a weekend at the spa?

50:37.038 --> 50:38.838
No, no.

50:38.973 --> 50:40.908
We were just thinking
that, I mean,

50:41.042 --> 50:44.178
we're basically doing
two jobs for you now.

50:44.312 --> 50:45.745
We cut out the middleman.

50:45.879 --> 50:48.916
Yeah, we did.
So we should make more money, right?

50:50.717 --> 50:52.485
You think you
deserve more money?

50:54.587 --> 50:56.057
I mean, yeah.

50:57.925 --> 51:01.162
Why, because you
get the addresses now?

51:02.129 --> 51:06.000
Oh, was that your idea to
get the addresses yourself?

51:06.766 --> 51:08.735
- It was Ellis.
- Ellis.

51:08.868 --> 51:11.906
Right, you're not much
of an idea guy, are you?

51:12.039 --> 51:13.975
I drive and
load the truck.

51:14.108 --> 51:15.709
Grunt work, basically.

51:15.842 --> 51:17.544
Except when somebody
speaks to you,

51:17.677 --> 51:19.646
then you're full
of brilliant ideas.

51:19.779 --> 51:24.517
Like your absolute classic to talk
to the fucking neighborhood watchman.

51:24.651 --> 51:26.553
I was trying to get rid of the guy!

51:26.686 --> 51:29.256
Yeah? What if that guy
could identify you,

51:29.390 --> 51:31.825
- pick you out of a lineup?
- I'm so careful, Mel,

51:31.959 --> 51:34.694
- I'd never get caught in a lineup.
- Maybe, maybe not.

51:34.828 --> 51:37.630
How do I know where the fuck you guys
will end up? You're unpredictable.

51:37.764 --> 51:42.236
So I'm supposed to pay you more
money to keep being unpredictable?

51:43.803 --> 51:46.773
That doesn't make
good business sense!

51:46.907 --> 51:48.508
Does it?

51:50.011 --> 51:53.114
Now shut up and get
back to fucking work.

51:59.053 --> 52:02.490
<i>An alert neighborhood watchman
managed a good look at one of the men.</i>

52:02.622 --> 52:05.692
- Oh, great!
- <i>Police released a sketch and ask if anybody</i>

52:05.825 --> 52:08.595
<i>recognizes him to contact
the authorities immediately.</i>

52:08.728 --> 52:11.165
Look at that, I'm so fucked!

52:11.298 --> 52:14.402
- Think anybody's gonna recognize you from that?
- What are you trying to say?

52:14.534 --> 52:16.137
Come on, you wish
you looked like that!

52:16.270 --> 52:17.405
Aw, come on, handsome!

52:17.537 --> 52:18.472
Fuck!

52:18.605 --> 52:19.907
Oh shit, come on!

52:20.041 --> 52:22.376
Shit. I'm going to go
check on George Clooney,

52:22.510 --> 52:23.877
make sure he's not crying.

52:24.011 --> 52:26.147
Man, he always
gets so sensitive.

52:26.280 --> 52:29.417
Okay, you're right, the sketch is funny.
But today was a close call.

52:29.549 --> 52:31.419
We really gotta be more careful.

52:31.551 --> 52:33.487
You don't think Ellis
is being careful?

52:33.620 --> 52:35.122
- I didn't say that.
- You literally just did.

52:35.256 --> 52:38.159
You don't think I
got things under control?

52:38.292 --> 52:42.129
Actually, no, you were freaking out
when Chandler was talking to that guy.

52:42.263 --> 52:45.399
- Can we not do this here?
- Yeah, can we not? It's a little intense.

52:46.467 --> 52:49.970
- Fuck both of you.
- Oh, come on, don't be a drama queen!

52:56.676 --> 52:58.678
You're no fucking help.

53:03.583 --> 53:05.519
Pass me the phone.

53:05.652 --> 53:08.355
- Look, Jack, he's...
- Come on, this is the only chance we get.

53:08.489 --> 53:10.657
Pass it to me now, let's go.

53:12.159 --> 53:13.194
Okay.

53:13.327 --> 53:15.062
- Jack, you got to hurry.
- Shh.

53:15.196 --> 53:17.031
Sure, that sketch
didn't look anything like him,

53:17.164 --> 53:19.100
but that doesn't mean
we shouldn't be more careful.

53:19.233 --> 53:21.701
- Jack, you got to hurry.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

53:21.835 --> 53:24.305
Jesus Christ, how many
pictures are there? Okay.

53:24.438 --> 53:27.508
That's not the point. Point is when you
say shit like that, it undermines me.

53:27.640 --> 53:29.143
What the fuck does that mean?

53:29.276 --> 53:31.112
Okay, we're not boss-employee
in this, Ellis.

53:31.245 --> 53:33.514
- We're a team. Aren't we?
- Are we?

53:33.646 --> 53:36.484
Because if I remember correct,
you told me you wanted out.

53:36.616 --> 53:40.321
- Jack.
- Just wait, it's going. Almost there.

53:40.454 --> 53:43.591
So we couldn't even be together
if I wasn't part of this?

53:44.624 --> 53:45.926
Huh?

53:46.527 --> 53:47.727
Answer.

53:47.861 --> 53:49.196
It's not that fucking hard.

53:51.532 --> 53:53.067
I'm done.

53:58.472 --> 54:00.040
Jack, pull it.
Pull it, Jack.

54:00.174 --> 54:02.176
Wait, wait,
almost there, almost there.

54:06.447 --> 54:09.716
- Wait, no, no, no.
- Okay, we got, got it, got it.

54:11.585 --> 54:13.087
Just shuffle, man.

54:13.220 --> 54:16.357
Jeez, I thought there was going
to be bloodshed for sure.

54:18.926 --> 54:21.328
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

54:24.265 --> 54:27.601
Just when you thought things couldn't get more exciting.

54:27.734 --> 54:29.904
- Jack, that was so close.
- Mm-hmm.

54:31.639 --> 54:32.640
All right.

54:32.772 --> 54:34.942
Some guy called
Daniel Wardlaw.

54:35.075 --> 54:37.144
Jesus, these photos
are out of a magazine.

54:37.278 --> 54:40.581
Most home systems
aren't rated by a UL system.

54:40.713 --> 54:42.917
This is a TL-60.
It can withstand attacks

54:43.050 --> 54:44.751
by common tools for
over an hour.

54:44.884 --> 54:46.287
Define common tools.

54:46.420 --> 54:48.022
Explosives, torches.

54:48.155 --> 54:50.624
I mean, Jack, this thing has
a military-grade vault door.

54:50.790 --> 54:52.493
We might as well
take the whole thing.

54:52.626 --> 54:54.861
- It's a room.
- Yeah.

54:54.995 --> 54:57.097
No wonder they're
showing it in a magazine.

54:58.165 --> 55:00.467
Jack, if we're going
to do this, we need Stewart.

55:01.602 --> 55:03.504
Mmm, fuck.

55:03.637 --> 55:05.239
He's put a
lot of work into this.

55:05.372 --> 55:07.641
It'd take time to
get in that safe.

55:07.774 --> 55:10.077
Digital lock will be
impossible to break.

55:10.211 --> 55:11.811
We'll have to burn our way.

55:11.946 --> 55:14.847
- Not easy to get, or cheap.
- Can you do it?

55:16.016 --> 55:17.284
Yeah, I could figure it out.

55:17.418 --> 55:19.886
Great, let's split
it three ways, even.

55:22.855 --> 55:24.857
Four. I'm not doing it
without Chandler.

55:24.992 --> 55:28.095
Two of you guys and one of me?
I don't know what else you're planning.

55:28.229 --> 55:30.130
It's not about you.
It's about Ellis.

55:30.264 --> 55:32.266
This is back pay for all
the times he screwed us over.

55:32.399 --> 55:34.168
Fine,
if this is just about Ellis,

55:34.301 --> 55:36.437
then you should have no
problem bringing Chandler on.

55:36.570 --> 55:40.274
Plus I don't want that crazy
PTSD bastard on Ellis's side.

55:40.407 --> 55:43.510
You know Ellis is going to be
pissed the fuck off if he finds out.

55:43.644 --> 55:46.547
Yeah, and that's why we're
counting on him not finding out.

55:46.680 --> 55:50.317
- Makes you feel better, you want him, done.
- Okay.

55:50.451 --> 55:53.420
There has to be a connection between
the value of the house and no schedule.

55:53.554 --> 55:55.456
This guy is so rich,
he never has to leave.

55:55.589 --> 55:57.790
I saw online the guy's
a big donor at a conference

55:57.925 --> 55:59.892
in New York in a couple weeks.

56:00.027 --> 56:01.929
Great, we'll do it then.
Can you get us a new car?

56:02.062 --> 56:03.763
No reason we drive
the moving truck in here.

56:03.896 --> 56:05.599
- I can get a van.
- All right, perfect.

56:05.733 --> 56:08.435
Let's do it then. But find out
exactly when this conference is.

56:08.569 --> 56:10.471
I don't want to show up
and find the housekeeper.

56:10.604 --> 56:13.007
No, you guys, this is
supposed to be a backup plan.

56:13.140 --> 56:15.075
Lance, dude,
you are new here, okay?

56:15.209 --> 56:17.244
Been dealing with his bullshit
way longer than you have.

56:17.378 --> 56:20.347
- Been trying to tell him.
- I vote we do Wardlaw when he's in New York.

56:20.481 --> 56:22.549
- I second that.
- All right, fine.

56:22.683 --> 56:26.287
- But we should keep doing what we've been doing.
- Lance is right.

56:27.388 --> 56:28.489
For now.

56:34.528 --> 56:35.629
She's not answering.

56:35.763 --> 56:37.564
We should have Lance try.

56:40.601 --> 56:41.801
She's not coming.

56:41.935 --> 56:43.237
Does she know
where we're going?

56:43.370 --> 56:45.838
- Yeah, so what?
- She's pissed at you.

56:45.973 --> 56:47.975
Nobody's seen her in days,
she could have flipped.

56:48.108 --> 56:49.943
I'm not doing this shit
till you figure it out.

56:50.077 --> 56:51.912
Doesn't feel right.

56:56.016 --> 56:58.485
Fine, I'll call her.

57:01.588 --> 57:02.656
Fucking phone.

57:02.790 --> 57:05.159
Something wrong
with your phone?

57:05.292 --> 57:08.395
- Give me your fucking phone.
- You know what? Fuck this, I'm out.

57:08.529 --> 57:11.532
- I'm out, I'm not doing this bullshit.
- Sorry, dude.

57:12.199 --> 57:14.435
This is a
fucking joke, right?

57:15.636 --> 57:17.204
You're joking.

57:18.339 --> 57:21.841
- Lance!
- If we're not in this together, it's nothing, Ellis.

57:25.179 --> 57:27.114
Telling you,
we gotta hit this place

57:27.247 --> 57:29.583
- whether this old fuck is there or not.
- Fuck it, I'm in.

57:29.717 --> 57:31.952
- I'm ready, let's do this!
- We shouldn't just make a decision

57:32.086 --> 57:34.788
- out of the spur of the moment!
- We gotta hit it now. You heard Ellis!

57:34.922 --> 57:37.624
You're putting us in this
position so we have to do this.

57:37.758 --> 57:40.260
Come on, you guys, we know that
Allie's not going to the cops.

57:40.394 --> 57:43.130
- I don't know, man, she's a wild card.
- I agree.

57:43.263 --> 57:44.998
Look, if we do this
when Wardlaw is in town,

57:45.132 --> 57:47.434
this whole thing goes from
a robbery to a kidnapping.

57:47.568 --> 57:50.137
And we're not here to
hurt anybody, right?

57:51.605 --> 57:53.340
Let me call Allie.

58:09.823 --> 58:11.225
I'm sorry...

58:12.760 --> 58:14.061
just...

58:15.796 --> 58:18.999
for not coming
around as much.

58:19.133 --> 58:22.770
I feel like, like I
disappointed you guys somehow.

58:22.902 --> 58:25.506
No, sweetie, not at all.

58:28.542 --> 58:31.478
I'm sorry, I have
to take this.

58:31.612 --> 58:32.546
Can I be excused?

58:32.679 --> 58:33.881
Of course.

58:35.649 --> 58:37.084
Sorry.

58:42.055 --> 58:43.323
I can't talk right now.

58:43.457 --> 58:47.361
Okay. Just wanted to call
and check up on you.

58:48.061 --> 58:49.530
They told you to call?

58:51.165 --> 58:53.133
Can we talk about this
in person?

59:05.045 --> 59:06.680
So this is where you grew up.

59:07.448 --> 59:08.549
Yep.

59:09.550 --> 59:11.718
This reminds me
of my aunt's house.

59:11.852 --> 59:13.220
Jack's mom.

59:15.622 --> 59:17.724
Why did you
come out here, Lance?

59:18.892 --> 59:21.662
Um, just wanted
to check on you.

59:24.498 --> 59:26.935
You know, we were
waiting for you, earlier.

59:27.067 --> 59:29.236
I'm sure you guys
did fine without me.

59:30.537 --> 59:31.940
We didn't go.

59:32.072 --> 59:33.407
Why not?

59:33.540 --> 59:36.743
I think you guys have been
doing this for so long

59:37.611 --> 59:39.246
that they didn't
really feel comfortable...

59:39.379 --> 59:41.081
They thought
I went to the cops.

59:43.417 --> 59:44.485
Yeah.

59:45.786 --> 59:47.321
I didn't, but...

59:49.289 --> 59:51.725
I just
needed to get away.

59:54.027 --> 59:56.396
But I don't belong
here anymore, either.

59:59.766 --> 1:00:03.070
What did you want to do,
before all this?

1:00:06.740 --> 1:00:08.709
Art.

1:00:08.842 --> 1:00:11.245
- Art?
- Yeah. But...

1:00:12.246 --> 1:00:13.547
guess that was
pretty pointless.

1:00:13.680 --> 1:00:15.415
No, you're not giving
yourself enough credit.

1:00:15.549 --> 1:00:18.418
You knew every expensive
piece in every house,

1:00:18.552 --> 1:00:20.521
made Mel a shit-ton of money.

1:00:21.522 --> 1:00:24.291
- You did!
- That's true.

1:00:24.424 --> 1:00:27.060
But the original plan was to
sell the art and not steal it.

1:00:27.194 --> 1:00:29.530
Right.

1:00:34.167 --> 1:00:35.569
What about you?

1:00:37.604 --> 1:00:41.508
I always
wanted to help people.

1:00:42.609 --> 1:00:43.810
Okay.

1:00:44.946 --> 1:00:46.413
Plan A was to be
a humanitarian,

1:00:46.547 --> 1:00:48.448
and Plan B was to rob houses.

1:00:48.582 --> 1:00:52.085
You're such an asshole.

1:00:52.586 --> 1:00:53.587
But, yes.

1:00:58.158 --> 1:00:59.726
You're coming back, right?

1:01:02.729 --> 1:01:04.064
Yeah.

1:01:05.799 --> 1:01:07.167
We need you.

1:01:08.835 --> 1:01:10.237
I know.

1:01:33.627 --> 1:01:35.095
I'm sorry.

1:01:37.798 --> 1:01:39.232
I'm sorry too.

1:01:41.768 --> 1:01:43.370
Are you going out?

1:01:44.137 --> 1:01:45.907
I've got to go see Mel.

1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:47.307
Why?

1:01:48.775 --> 1:01:50.410
Why do you think?

1:01:54.514 --> 1:01:56.550
You can come with me
if you want.

1:01:59.653 --> 1:02:00.787
Or not.

1:02:13.867 --> 1:02:15.669
Allie!

1:02:15.802 --> 1:02:17.237
Glad you could make it.

1:02:18.505 --> 1:02:20.240
Anybody know what the fuck
we're doing here?

1:02:20.374 --> 1:02:22.209
Got to explain
what happened today.

1:02:22.342 --> 1:02:24.444
- All of us?
- Not you.

1:02:24.578 --> 1:02:27.381
You don't explain shit,
keep your fucking mouth shut.

1:02:28.315 --> 1:02:30.350
Hey, right on time.

1:02:33.087 --> 1:02:35.322
I think you finally earned
the opportunity to meet

1:02:35.455 --> 1:02:38.325
one of my associates, Teddy.

1:02:39.526 --> 1:02:41.795
What do you think of
these jokers, Teddy?

1:02:42.796 --> 1:02:45.332
- Younger than the last crew.
- Uh-huh.

1:02:45.465 --> 1:02:47.135
There's no need to
introduce yourselves,

1:02:47.267 --> 1:02:48.769
he already knows
all your names.

1:02:48.902 --> 1:02:51.838
Mel, what happened
today won't happen again.

1:02:52.239 --> 1:02:53.807
That's nice.

1:02:54.808 --> 1:02:56.309
Yeah.

1:02:56.443 --> 1:02:59.613
You're such a nice group
of kids, tight-knit.

1:02:59.746 --> 1:03:02.349
Friendship, that's
everything, right?

1:03:03.017 --> 1:03:04.785
Like me and Teddy over here.

1:03:06.054 --> 1:03:08.355
But that's not what
we're here to talk about.

1:03:09.623 --> 1:03:12.292
We're here to discuss
the possibility that

1:03:12.426 --> 1:03:14.528
you may not have
taken the day off.

1:03:15.063 --> 1:03:16.563
Why would we lie to you?

1:03:16.697 --> 1:03:20.534
So you could unload what
you stole on someone else.

1:03:20.667 --> 1:03:22.536
We don't have
anybody else like that.

1:03:22.669 --> 1:03:24.237
I mean, it wasn't
that long ago

1:03:24.371 --> 1:03:25.839
you couldn't get
the addresses yourselves.

1:03:25.973 --> 1:03:27.808
And you've made
very clear, in the interim,

1:03:27.942 --> 1:03:30.178
that you think you deserve
more than I pay you.

1:03:30.310 --> 1:03:32.947
- Don't we?
- See? There you go.

1:03:33.081 --> 1:03:36.984
But you made the choice to
make it harder for yourselves.

1:03:37.118 --> 1:03:41.122
And for me too because,
since I don't get the addresses anymore,

1:03:41.254 --> 1:03:42.856
I can't even
follow up on this house

1:03:42.990 --> 1:03:45.059
you may or may not
have hit this afternoon.

1:03:45.193 --> 1:03:48.963
Can we just all take a moment
just to get on the same page here?

1:03:49.097 --> 1:03:52.532
Nah. I don't think we're on
the same page about anything.

1:03:52.666 --> 1:03:57.637
You see, some of you feel you
deserve more for the same work.

1:03:57.771 --> 1:03:59.806
And others think
they're entitled,

1:03:59.941 --> 1:04:03.510
and some of you think leaving
your statement makes you

1:04:03.643 --> 1:04:05.812
as special
as your mommy made you,

1:04:05.947 --> 1:04:08.448
each and every one
a little snowflake.

1:04:08.582 --> 1:04:13.286
But the only thing you have
in common is being lazy.

1:04:13.420 --> 1:04:15.889
We didn't do the hit
because we weren't feeling it.

1:04:17.191 --> 1:04:21.495
It was out of caution for
our sake and for your sake.

1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:30.037
Well, why did you have
a bad feeling about it?

1:04:30.171 --> 1:04:31.738
I had a feeling.

1:04:32.272 --> 1:04:33.306
Okay?

1:04:33.440 --> 1:04:35.076
And you should be thanking us.

1:04:37.410 --> 1:04:38.712
Holy shit.

1:04:38.845 --> 1:04:40.580
Mel, today was
just a minor setback.

1:04:40.714 --> 1:04:43.383
We're not selling
to anybody else.

1:04:44.584 --> 1:04:46.820
I think you're
going to have to.

1:04:47.621 --> 1:04:50.024
Because this, tonight?

1:04:50.657 --> 1:04:53.527
Is the end of this agreement.

1:04:56.797 --> 1:05:01.102
But those friendships,
they just got more important than ever.

1:05:02.003 --> 1:05:04.771
Because if someone considers
going off the tracks

1:05:04.906 --> 1:05:07.074
and ends up talking,
my friend Teddy here,

1:05:07.208 --> 1:05:08.341
he doesn't just
know your names.

1:05:08.475 --> 1:05:09.911
He knows where you live.

1:05:10.044 --> 1:05:13.214
He knows where your mom lives,
and what her maiden name was

1:05:13.346 --> 1:05:14.614
before she moved there.

1:05:14.748 --> 1:05:17.417
He knows what you drive,
and where you party.

1:05:17.551 --> 1:05:21.721
So if one of you even so
much as whispers my name,

1:05:21.855 --> 1:05:25.927
that man's face will be
the last thing all of you see.

1:05:26.760 --> 1:05:30.630
So, treasure your friendships.

1:05:36.971 --> 1:05:38.538
You're a fucking joke.

1:05:40.407 --> 1:05:41.808
Allie, come on.

1:05:44.912 --> 1:05:49.716
You are pushing 50
and peddling stolen shit.

1:05:50.750 --> 1:05:53.054
I think you might
be the problem, Mel.

1:05:53.187 --> 1:05:56.356
You think we'd be doing any of this
if it wasn't for someone like you?

1:05:56.489 --> 1:05:59.160
You can blame me
as much as you want,

1:05:59.293 --> 1:06:01.195
but don't lie to yourself.

1:06:01.329 --> 1:06:03.931
If you guys weren't doing this,
it'd be something else just as bad.

1:06:04.065 --> 1:06:05.967
I don't give a fuck
what you think.

1:06:06.100 --> 1:06:11.138
I just wanted to remind
you that you are just

1:06:11.272 --> 1:06:13.406
as pathetic as we are.

1:06:23.251 --> 1:06:26.586
<i>Ellis blamed me for what
happened that night, and I get that.</i>

1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:28.488
<i>But I hit the point
where I stopped caring</i>

1:06:28.622 --> 1:06:30.224
<i>if I was acting reckless.</i>

1:06:30.358 --> 1:06:33.793
<i>Ellis was pitching the guys on
some bullshit one-last-heist.</i>

1:06:33.928 --> 1:06:35.695
There's a guy
called Daniel Wardlaw.

1:06:35.829 --> 1:06:38.266
He has a vault underneath
his house, enough cash to...

1:06:38.398 --> 1:06:39.967
<i>I just tuned them out.</i>

1:06:42.636 --> 1:06:44.972
<i>I didn't give a fuck about
any of this anymore.</i>

1:06:58.386 --> 1:07:01.222
He leaves home for
three or four days next week...

1:07:01.355 --> 1:07:02.957
we can hit it then.

1:07:04.524 --> 1:07:05.993
My guy is here.

1:07:08.862 --> 1:07:10.965
We got to do this now,
before Ellis does.

1:07:11.098 --> 1:07:13.968
- I'm not doing it if someone's home.
- He's 100 fucking years old.

1:07:14.101 --> 1:07:16.703
He's probably not even going to hear us.
We've got to do this.

1:07:16.836 --> 1:07:18.538
Otherwise we're stuck with him.

1:07:18.672 --> 1:07:20.041
<i>The average
human body can handle</i>

1:07:20.174 --> 1:07:22.609
<i>anywhere up to
600 milligrams of Molly.</i>

1:07:24.811 --> 1:07:26.813
<i>I took more than twice
that amount that night,</i>

1:07:26.948 --> 1:07:29.183
<i>and a full three grams
of blow.</i>

1:07:35.089 --> 1:07:37.425
- Something happened to Allie. Ellis!
- Fuck off, ruining my high.

1:07:37.557 --> 1:07:41.262
- Ellis, listen to me, man! We gotta go!
- She's your fucking problem.

1:07:42.196 --> 1:07:44.531
<i>Rule #8: The most dangerous people</i>

1:07:44.664 --> 1:07:46.300
<i>are those with
nothing to lose.</i>

1:07:46.434 --> 1:07:50.037
How is she? Take a left.
Gotta get to the hospital.

1:07:50.171 --> 1:07:51.771
We're not going
to the fucking hospital.

1:07:51.906 --> 1:07:53.873
We've got drugs in the car,
we're fucked up.

1:07:54.008 --> 1:07:56.410
- We're going to get fucking busted.
- Jack, please!

1:07:56.543 --> 1:07:58.012
Keep her up,
she'll choke on her throw-up.

1:07:58.145 --> 1:07:59.813
Calm the fuck down, man!

1:07:59.947 --> 1:08:01.781
- We're going to take her home.
- Take her home?

1:08:01.916 --> 1:08:05.353
She's OD'ing, what are you
talking about? Jack, please.

1:08:05.485 --> 1:08:07.754
Okay, fine, we'll take her
to the fucking hospital.

1:08:15.562 --> 1:08:18.531
Now what?

1:08:18.665 --> 1:08:20.134
- I'm not taking her in.
- Fuck that.

1:08:20.267 --> 1:08:22.103
- I'm not fucking going in there.
- I'll take her.

1:08:22.236 --> 1:08:25.239
- Stay in the car.
- If we go in, we're getting arrested.

1:08:25.373 --> 1:08:28.075
- Someone needs to take her.
- Someone's gonna see us, Stewart. Hurry.

1:08:28.209 --> 1:08:30.478
- What the fuck do you want me to do?
- Just get her out.

1:08:30.610 --> 1:08:34.081
- Someone needs to stay.
- We do not have a choice. She cannot be in this car.

1:08:34.215 --> 1:08:36.883
- Security is coming. Hurry the fuck up!
- Fuck it!

1:08:38.119 --> 1:08:40.553
- Fucking kidding me?
- Lance, stay in the car!

1:08:40.687 --> 1:08:42.889
The fuck is wrong
with you guys?

1:08:43.590 --> 1:08:45.059
Oh, fuck.

1:08:47.361 --> 1:08:51.032
Hey! I need a stretcher,
I need a stretcher right now!

1:08:53.267 --> 1:08:55.436
Alicia, I need some
assistance over here.

1:08:56.037 --> 1:08:57.905
Coming, I'm coming.

1:09:03.010 --> 1:09:04.378
Looks like an OD.

1:09:04.512 --> 1:09:05.645
Let's get her
on the stretcher.

1:09:05.779 --> 1:09:07.547
Open her airways...

1:09:10.951 --> 1:09:12.420
We've still got a pulse.

1:09:12.552 --> 1:09:14.055
Let's get her inside.

1:09:27.700 --> 1:09:29.836
I'm ready to be done
with all of this.

1:09:31.571 --> 1:09:32.973
You should be.

1:09:34.741 --> 1:09:36.776
You don't owe them anything.

1:09:39.779 --> 1:09:41.082
What's your plan?

1:09:43.284 --> 1:09:44.684
I'll go home.

1:09:45.685 --> 1:09:47.021
Pack.

1:09:48.289 --> 1:09:49.356
I'll figure it out.

1:09:50.623 --> 1:09:52.259
I might have something.

1:09:54.495 --> 1:09:58.132
And if it works, it might
be a way out of all of this.

1:09:59.666 --> 1:10:01.068
I really hope so.

1:10:09.110 --> 1:10:11.644
Yo, you give
Chandler that gun?

1:10:11.778 --> 1:10:14.848
- No, why?
- Because he's actually shot one before.

1:10:14.982 --> 1:10:18.018
- I think I can shoot a gun.
- Who said anything about shooting?

1:10:18.152 --> 1:10:20.421
- I thought we were just using it to scare him?
- Yeah, exactly.

1:10:20.554 --> 1:10:22.822
- See, it doesn't even matter.
- Jesus Christ.

1:10:22.957 --> 1:10:25.092
I can't believe
you brought a fucking gun.

1:10:26.793 --> 1:10:28.529
What do you think,
Lance? Huh?

1:10:28.661 --> 1:10:30.630
I don't give a shit.
That's what I think.

1:10:30.763 --> 1:10:34.034
If you're still upset about Allie,
you need to get the fuck over it,

1:10:34.168 --> 1:10:36.971
- because we got work to do.
- You know what? Fuck you, Stewart.

1:10:37.104 --> 1:10:40.975
I can't just get over the fact we left one of
our best friends to die on a fucking sidewalk.

1:10:41.108 --> 1:10:42.943
Hey, none of us
wanted to do that, okay?

1:10:43.077 --> 1:10:44.478
Yeah, none of us
wanted to do it,

1:10:44.612 --> 1:10:45.845
but you fucking did it, right?

1:10:45.980 --> 1:10:47.515
You threw her right
on the street!

1:10:47.647 --> 1:10:48.983
Because I didn't
want to go to jail!

1:10:49.116 --> 1:10:51.318
No one wants to
go to jail, dumb fuck!

1:10:51.452 --> 1:10:53.988
I spent the whole night in the
hospital, and guess where I am?

1:10:54.121 --> 1:10:56.656
- Sitting right in front of you, right?
- Stop!

1:10:58.725 --> 1:11:00.261
Get the fuck out of here.

1:11:00.394 --> 1:11:02.029
Get the fuck out of here.

1:11:02.930 --> 1:11:04.864
Fucking idiot.

1:11:06.267 --> 1:11:08.768
You know what's
the best part about this?

1:11:09.370 --> 1:11:10.604
What?

1:11:10.737 --> 1:11:13.073
That I never have
to see you fuckers again.

1:11:13.773 --> 1:11:15.342
You said it.

1:11:48.509 --> 1:11:49.842
What?

1:12:04.491 --> 1:12:05.693
Alarm's off.

1:12:06.460 --> 1:12:07.494
Fuck this guy.

1:12:17.638 --> 1:12:19.073
You deal with the cameras.

1:12:19.540 --> 1:12:20.507
Let's find him.

1:12:20.641 --> 1:12:22.009
Copy.

1:12:32.052 --> 1:12:33.921
Don't move.

1:12:34.455 --> 1:12:35.923
Don't you fucking move.

1:12:36.690 --> 1:12:38.592
- Jack!
- Get up.

1:12:38.726 --> 1:12:41.262
- Anybody else in the house?
- No, no, please, take what you want.

1:12:41.395 --> 1:12:43.530
- What's the code for the safe?
- What safe?

1:12:43.664 --> 1:12:48.002
- Do not fuck with me! Think I give a fuck about your life?
- 9-12-23.

1:12:48.135 --> 1:12:50.237
- Did you catch that, Stewart?
- I got it.

1:12:50.371 --> 1:12:52.139
- Get down!
- Jack!

1:12:52.273 --> 1:12:55.808
Give me your fucking hands.
There we go.

1:12:55.943 --> 1:12:57.711
- Jack.
- Get the fuck off me!

1:12:57.844 --> 1:12:59.380
Roll over.

1:13:01.382 --> 1:13:03.783
Don't make a fucking noise.

1:13:03.917 --> 1:13:07.820
Come on.

1:13:31.178 --> 1:13:34.214
Open sesame,
motherfucker. Open it.

1:13:45.025 --> 1:13:45.959
Holy shit.

1:13:46.093 --> 1:13:47.361
Holy shit's right.

1:13:47.494 --> 1:13:49.363
Okay, come on,
let's fill it up.

1:13:59.506 --> 1:14:02.409
- Shit, it's just spilling everywhere!
- So much fucking money.

1:14:10.084 --> 1:14:12.252
I've never seen this
much money in my whole life.

1:14:12.386 --> 1:14:15.656
Fuck Ellis.
Fuck all those assholes.

1:14:16.757 --> 1:14:21.462
We're rich. I'm going
to buy a boat, buy a house.

1:14:22.162 --> 1:14:24.264
Get my mom something nice.

1:14:24.398 --> 1:14:26.500
Take my brother out to dinner.

1:14:42.049 --> 1:14:45.419
Yo, yo-yo-yo.
Hold this, hold this open.

1:15:07.708 --> 1:15:10.244
<i>What the fuck is
wrong with you guys?</i>

1:15:50.784 --> 1:15:55.956
<i>Rule #9: Emotions are more
powerful than rational thought.</i>

1:16:05.232 --> 1:16:07.701
Yo, open the fucking door!

1:16:07.835 --> 1:16:08.937
No!

1:16:18.178 --> 1:16:19.980
- What happened?
- They're locked in.

1:16:20.113 --> 1:16:23.083
- What?
- We got to go, now!

1:16:39.366 --> 1:16:41.168
Go, go, go, go, go.

1:16:42.903 --> 1:16:45.172
What the fuck was that?

1:16:45.974 --> 1:16:48.408
- The door shut.
- The door shut?

1:16:48.542 --> 1:16:52.713
The door shut by itself?
Lance, did you fucking close the door?

1:16:52.846 --> 1:16:55.215
- Maybe I did.
- Are you fucking kidding me with that shit, Lance?

1:16:55.349 --> 1:16:58.552
- Do you not understand they're going to rat now?
- We'll just fucking lay low.

1:16:58.685 --> 1:17:00.754
You're just pissed,
that's why you closed them in there.

1:17:00.888 --> 1:17:04.091
You pissed at me? Because I was
in that car when we threw her out.

1:17:04.224 --> 1:17:07.227
Yeah, well, maybe you were lucky
you weren't in that vault too.

1:17:10.197 --> 1:17:14.501
- Allie, listen to me.
- Allie... Allie, really? My fucking God.

1:17:14.635 --> 1:17:16.236
No, I don't have
any time to explain.

1:17:16.370 --> 1:17:18.038
Please, you got to pack
your bag right now.

1:17:18.171 --> 1:17:19.941
I got to get you out of
the city, Allie, please.

1:17:20.073 --> 1:17:25.379
Goddamn it, Lance, slow the fuck down.

1:17:25.512 --> 1:17:29.017
You gotta be fucking kidding me with this
shit, Lance. Come on, think for a second.

1:17:29.149 --> 1:17:33.820
- Stay and watch the fucking van.
- Stay in the fucking van? You're gonna fuck this up for her?

1:17:33.955 --> 1:17:36.991
You don't think she's going to tell
Ellis what we did? What you did?

1:17:37.124 --> 1:17:38.492
The cops are on their way,

1:17:38.625 --> 1:17:41.094
so this is not
the time for this.

1:17:41.228 --> 1:17:43.130
You're not going
to listen to me now?

1:17:43.263 --> 1:17:44.431
After all of this...

1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:48.869
I can take you out.

1:17:55.442 --> 1:17:58.478
Don't fucking
touch me, Jack.

1:18:02.583 --> 1:18:06.720
Lance, this is embarrassing. What do you
think is going to happen? Give me the keys.

1:18:06.853 --> 1:18:09.590
- What the fuck, Lance?
- Allie, let's go.

1:18:09.723 --> 1:18:12.092
- You asked me to get you out of this shit.
- But how?

1:18:12.225 --> 1:18:14.127
- Tell her why we're here.
- Tell me what?

1:18:14.261 --> 1:18:15.930
- Jack, shut up!
- Tell her.

1:18:16.064 --> 1:18:19.033
We have more cash in the van than
we've ever made, or ever will make.

1:18:19.166 --> 1:18:22.502
Stewart and Chandler got caught. You and
Ellis will be next too if you don't come.

1:18:22.636 --> 1:18:25.105
- What did you do?
- We hit the Wardlaw house.

1:18:25.238 --> 1:18:28.709
- That's your plan to get us out?
- It wasn't my plan but that's what happened. Let's go.

1:18:28.842 --> 1:18:30.844
Did I hear
that correct?

1:18:36.084 --> 1:18:39.186
You come to my house and you
pull a fucking gun on me?

1:18:40.654 --> 1:18:43.790
You know, there's
two kinds of dogs.

1:18:43.925 --> 1:18:48.362
There's the ones that bark,
fucking yappy little fuckers.

1:18:48.495 --> 1:18:51.032
Yap-yap-yap-yap.

1:18:51.164 --> 1:18:53.433
And then there's
the ones that bite.

1:18:56.037 --> 1:18:58.705
I know what kind of dog you are.

1:18:58.839 --> 1:19:00.741
Okay, Lance, let's get
out of here, come on.

1:19:00.874 --> 1:19:01.909
Allie.

1:19:03.176 --> 1:19:04.778
Are you coming
with me or not?

1:19:04.912 --> 1:19:06.713
She ain't
going anywhere.

1:19:08.382 --> 1:19:09.816
Allie, please.

1:19:12.152 --> 1:19:13.921
Fuck both of you.

1:19:14.655 --> 1:19:16.090
Lance, let's go, come on.

1:19:16.223 --> 1:19:17.557
Come on.

1:19:59.900 --> 1:20:03.203
I mean, that just
went great for you, huh?

1:20:09.743 --> 1:20:13.114
Fuck, okay. It all started
with this guy Mel Donnelly.

1:20:13.246 --> 1:20:14.848
He's basically like our boss.

1:20:14.982 --> 1:20:16.316
<i>We got our addresses from Mel.</i>

1:20:16.450 --> 1:20:17.784
- <i>I think he got 'em from...</i>
- Fuck.

1:20:17.919 --> 1:20:21.354
<i>...some insurance guy
from State By State Insurance,</i>

1:20:21.488 --> 1:20:24.257
<i>some bullshit like that.
I think they were that guy's clients.</i>

1:20:24.391 --> 1:20:29.796
<i>Once we got the addresses,
we'd stake out a house for like a week.</i>

1:20:53.420 --> 1:20:57.290
<i>I know that Jack was as
guilty as Stewart and Chandler.</i>

1:20:57.424 --> 1:21:00.794
<i>But in the end,
he was all I had.</i>

1:21:06.333 --> 1:21:09.003
<i>Reports now
indicate that the Wardlaw robbery</i>

1:21:09.137 --> 1:21:12.472
<i>was just one of a string of
robberies in the Chicago suburbs.</i>

1:21:12.606 --> 1:21:14.808
<i>At least 70 robberies
from the past two years</i>

1:21:14.942 --> 1:21:17.011
<i>are believed to be
part of the string.</i>

1:21:17.145 --> 1:21:20.781
<i>Four suspects have been apprehended
in connection to the robberies.</i>

1:21:20.915 --> 1:21:23.517
<i>Three more are
currently at large.</i>

1:21:27.387 --> 1:21:30.323
Fuck, it's hot in here.

1:21:36.730 --> 1:21:38.698
Dude, I'm going
to get some ice.

1:21:39.200 --> 1:21:40.801
Fuck.

1:22:08.262 --> 1:22:10.363
- You okay?
- No, I'm not okay, Jack.

1:22:10.497 --> 1:22:11.999
None of this is fucking okay.

1:22:12.133 --> 1:22:14.501
Let's just get some rest.
We'll get out of here tomorrow.

1:22:14.634 --> 1:22:17.470
We can't go anywhere with
our faces all over the news.

1:22:19.472 --> 1:22:21.842
Lance, come on. Sit down.

1:22:32.485 --> 1:22:37.258
I promise, first thing in the morning, we're out of here.

1:22:38.391 --> 1:22:40.861
But we got each other, and right
now, that's all I care about

1:22:40.995 --> 1:22:44.798
because I would not want to be stuck
in this situation with anyone else.

1:22:44.932 --> 1:22:49.103
I know you may not feel the same way.
And that's okay.

1:22:49.237 --> 1:22:52.139
You've been through a lot today
and you're upset, and I get it.

1:22:53.874 --> 1:22:55.910
We've all done
shitty things here.

1:23:00.881 --> 1:23:03.717
I wouldn't have shut that vault
door if you were in it, Jack.

1:23:04.384 --> 1:23:05.619
I know.

1:23:08.055 --> 1:23:10.423
Maybe I would have
deserved it if you did.

1:23:11.791 --> 1:23:12.559
Wow.

1:23:12.692 --> 1:23:13.995
But I forgive you.

1:23:15.296 --> 1:23:17.898
Just like you forgive me
because we're family, right?

1:23:21.235 --> 1:23:22.937
First thing
in the morning...

1:23:25.139 --> 1:23:26.673
let's ditch the van.

1:23:28.508 --> 1:23:30.077
We'll get the money
and we'll head west.

1:23:30.211 --> 1:23:31.745
First thing
in the morning.

1:23:31.878 --> 1:23:35.182
But right now, seriously,
we need to get some sleep.

1:23:35.316 --> 1:23:38.785
- Jack, I can't sleep.
- Oh, yes, I think you can.

1:23:38.920 --> 1:23:41.655
You'll be out as soon as your
head hits the pillow, I promise.

1:23:41.788 --> 1:23:44.191
It's been a long, long day.

1:23:46.027 --> 1:23:47.061
Go on.

1:23:53.167 --> 1:23:54.634
Deep breaths.

1:23:57.771 --> 1:24:02.076
And when the heat's off,
we'll go wherever we want to go.

1:24:03.543 --> 1:24:05.478
Do whatever we want to do.

1:24:06.780 --> 1:24:08.815
Be whoever we want to be.

1:24:10.483 --> 1:24:11.885
We'll go anywhere.

1:24:13.220 --> 1:24:14.621
Blend in.

1:24:16.357 --> 1:24:17.691
We'll leave
all this behind.

1:24:17.824 --> 1:24:19.759
It'll be nothing
but a memory.

1:24:22.997 --> 1:24:26.566
Like a dream you can only
remember a few details of.

1:24:27.834 --> 1:24:29.703
We'll finally be free...

1:24:32.505 --> 1:24:34.674
and live the life
we've always wanted.

1:26:04.831 --> 1:26:06.833
<i>I had nowhere to go.</i>

1:26:06.967 --> 1:26:10.337
<i>No money, no chances
of getting away.</i>

1:26:11.205 --> 1:26:13.240
<i>I thought if
I turned myself in,</i>

1:26:13.374 --> 1:26:16.010
<i>they'd have a better chance
of catching Jack.</i>

1:26:18.611 --> 1:26:20.580
Just wasn't fast enough.

1:26:21.881 --> 1:26:25.486
So, do you think that
was Jack's plan all along,

1:26:25.618 --> 1:26:30.757
to bring you in just
to leave you behind?

1:26:33.494 --> 1:26:36.330
<i>It's not really about the art. You did
it already, might as well enjoy it.</i>

1:26:36.464 --> 1:26:38.865
<i>Just you and me on this.
You should take Lance.</i>

1:26:38.999 --> 1:26:41.068
<i>She's a wild card.
Because we're family, right?</i>

1:26:42.269 --> 1:26:43.703
I have no idea.

1:26:45.172 --> 1:26:48.675
- I'm glad I told them everything.
- You get a reduced sentence?

1:26:48.808 --> 1:26:53.414
Yeah. But I shouldn't be in here, anyway.
I'm a political prisoner.

1:26:53.547 --> 1:26:55.483
Excuse me?

1:26:55.615 --> 1:26:58.519
Everything I did,
I did in rebellion against this system.

1:26:58.651 --> 1:27:01.788
- I was terrified at the time.
- I didn't see what was going on in front of me.

1:27:01.922 --> 1:27:04.158
It really was all
about the joy of destruction.

1:27:04.291 --> 1:27:06.360
- I was in a weak psychological state.
- He used me.

1:27:06.494 --> 1:27:09.330
- I'm happy we were caught.
- Hey lady, you should write that down.

1:27:09.463 --> 1:27:12.765
- It's not gonna get better than that.
- Tell me about Ellis.

1:27:12.899 --> 1:27:15.136
You testified
you don't know where he is.

1:27:15.269 --> 1:27:18.838
Do you still feel
the need to protect him?

1:27:20.807 --> 1:27:22.409
Just from me.

1:27:23.511 --> 1:27:24.578
Would you do it again?

1:27:24.711 --> 1:27:25.645
Fuck no!

1:27:25.778 --> 1:27:27.515
- No.
- No.

1:27:27.647 --> 1:27:29.883
- What was your sentence?
- Seven years.

1:27:30.017 --> 1:27:32.052
- Thirteen years.
- Nine years.

1:27:32.186 --> 1:27:33.954
- 55 counts of breaking and entering.
- 56 counts...

1:27:34.088 --> 1:27:35.889
- 24 counts...
- One count armed robbery.

1:27:36.023 --> 1:27:37.024
- Robbery...
- Vandalism.

1:27:37.158 --> 1:27:39.260
- Vandalism.
- One kidnapping,

1:27:39.393 --> 1:27:40.427
but I appealed.

1:27:50.037 --> 1:27:52.239
You gave
me only nine rules.

1:27:53.107 --> 1:27:55.209
Is there
a tenth commandment?

1:27:59.180 --> 1:28:00.214
Yeah.

1:28:01.582 --> 1:28:05.319
The tenth commandment is that the rest
of those rules are a bunch of bullshit.

1:28:08.788 --> 1:28:10.457
What was your sentence?

1:28:11.525 --> 1:28:13.093
Twelve years.

1:28:15.029 --> 1:28:18.165
Fifteen counts
of robbery and vandalism.

1:28:19.799 --> 1:28:21.602
I'll be out in eight, I think.

1:28:22.369 --> 1:28:26.773
Lance, you mentioned
a generation gap

1:28:26.907 --> 1:28:29.076
when we first started.

1:28:29.210 --> 1:28:32.213
I feel obligated to tell you
that I have a pretty fair

1:28:32.346 --> 1:28:34.481
understanding
of your age group.

1:28:34.615 --> 1:28:40.654
Statistics indicate that your
generation, by and large,

1:28:40.787 --> 1:28:44.191
is much more than
an echo of anything.

1:28:44.325 --> 1:28:50.197
Crime among your age group
is down 70%.

1:28:51.065 --> 1:28:55.835
Tobacco and alcohol,
lower than ever.

1:28:55.970 --> 1:28:59.806
Much more diverse, so much
more racially tolerant.

1:28:59.940 --> 1:29:03.010
You're going to put
people to sleep with that book.

1:29:05.346 --> 1:29:06.947
Okay, Lance.

1:29:07.081 --> 1:29:09.450
I have one last question.

1:29:10.451 --> 1:29:12.453
Would you do it again?

1:29:31.305 --> 1:29:32.973
In a heartbeat.
