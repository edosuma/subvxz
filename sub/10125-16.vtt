ARNIE COHEN, SPORTS,

09:32.033 --> 09:35.133
AND FILLING IN FOR
VACATIONING CAL KILBRIDE,

09:35.133 --> 09:36.133
ERIC MATTHEWS, WEATHER.

09:36.133 --> 09:37.200
THAT'S ME!

09:39.500 --> 09:41.200
SO? HUH?
DID YOU SEE ME?

09:41.200 --> 09:42.400
YOU WERE
SO GOOD.

09:42.400 --> 09:44.500
AND YOU WERE
SO HANDSOME.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.033
WAY TO GO,
PAL.

09:46.033 --> 09:47.500
BRAVO, ERIC.

09:47.500 --> 09:48.900
THANK YOU, MR. FEENY.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.500
WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO BE
A WEATHERMAN AT 3,

09:51.500 --> 09:54.834
WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE TAKEN YOU
TO THAT DOCTOR.

09:54.834 --> 09:58.700
I'M ASKING YOU THIS
'CAUSE YOU DON'T LOVE ME
AS MUCH AS THEM.

09:58.700 --> 10:01.200
DID YOU LIKE ME BETTER ON
THE 5:00 OR 10:00 EDITION?

10:01.200 --> 10:04.200
I'M ACTUALLY HERE
TO TALK ABOUT
YOUR HISTORY PAPER

10:04.200 --> 10:05.800
AND THE CLASSES
YOU'VE MISSED?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.033
ERIC, MR. FEENY SAYS

10:07.033 --> 10:10.600
THAT YOU'RE
IN SERIOUS DANGER
OF NOT GRADUATING.

10:10.600 --> 10:13.767
BUT YOU'RE LUCKY.
HE'S ALLOWING YOU
TO MAKE UP THE WORK.

10:13.767 --> 10:16.600
UH, GREAT.
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

10:16.600 --> 10:20.500
A 2,000-WORD ESSAY
ON RECONSTRUCTIONISM
AFTER THE CIVIL WAR.

10:20.500 --> 10:22.200
WHEN DO YOU NEED IT?

10:22.200 --> 10:24.767
ON MY DESK
BY 3:00 FRIDAY.

10:24.767 --> 10:27.300
OOH. NOT IN
MY FIVE-DAY
FORECAST.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.900
I'M ON CALL
ALL WEEK.

10:28.900 --> 10:32.200
PUT IT IN YOUR FORECAST.
YOU'RE DOING THAT ESSAY.

10:32.200 --> 10:36.000
I CAN'T DO BOTH.
YOU CAN'T MEAN
GIVE UP THE STATION.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.800
I'VE FINALLY
FOUND SOMETHING
I'M GOOD AT.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.133
THIS ISN'T
A DISCUSSION.

10:39.133 --> 10:41.667
ERIC, THINK
ABOUT THIS.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.200
I HAVE.

10:43.200 --> 10:45.667
I'M GOING
TO THE STATION
WHERE I BELONG.

10:45.667 --> 10:48.500
I DON'T BELONG
IN SOME CLASSROOM
PRETENDING TO LISTEN.

10:48.500 --> 10:50.500
NO OFFENSE,
MR. FEENY.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.100
ERIC, SEE, THAT
IS YOUR PROBLEM.
YOU DON'T LISTEN.

10:53.100 --> 10:56.734
DAD, I'M GOING
TO BE 18 TOMORROW...
IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.

10:56.734 --> 10:58.567
I THINK I CAN MAKE
MY OWN DECISIONS.

10:58.567 --> 11:01.100
ERIC, I URGE YOU
TO RECONSIDER.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.500
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
TO THINK ABOUT.

11:03.500 --> 11:04.900
ERIC.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.667
ARE YOU...
OR ARE YOU NOT

11:06.667 --> 11:08.567
GOING TO GO
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW?

11:10.000 --> 11:11.300
I'M NOT GOING.

11:22.500 --> 11:25.500
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M RELATED
TO A DROPOUT.

11:25.500 --> 11:28.200
HE'S NOT
A DROPOUT...
YET.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.767
NO, HE'S JUST TAKING
A LEAVE OF ABSENCE,
RIGHT?

11:30.767 --> 11:33.233
LIKE THE GUY
WITH THE TINFOIL HAT

11:33.233 --> 11:34.834
WHO PUSHES
THE BABY CARRIAGE

11:34.834 --> 11:37.567
FILLED WITH EMPTY
TUNA FISH CANS?

11:37.567 --> 11:41.367
LOOKS LIKE<i>I'LL </i>BE
THE FIRST MATTHEWS TO
GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.400
WHAT ABOUT ME?

11:43.400 --> 11:44.867
YEAH, RIGHT.

11:49.934 --> 11:50.967
MORNING.

11:50.967 --> 11:52.867
MORNING.
MORNING.

11:52.867 --> 11:54.500
OH. ERIC--

11:54.500 --> 11:56.600
COR, I'M REALLY NOT
IN THE MOOD RIGHT NOW.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.500
O.K. I WAS JUST
GOING TO WISH YOU
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.300
HEY, TAKE A HAT.

12:02.300 --> 12:05.133
ANOTHER STORM FRONT'S
COMING IN.

12:05.133 --> 12:06.867
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD
AT THAT STUFF.

12:06.867 --> 12:08.500
CORY, SCHOOL.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.500
OH, I'M THERE.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.767
CORY MATTHEWS?
HERE.

12:14.200 --> 12:18.367
SO, I HOPE WE HAD
A GOOD NIGHT'S REST.

12:18.367 --> 12:20.567
SLEPT LIKE A BABY.

12:20.567 --> 12:22.100
'CAUSE YOU ARE ONE.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.767
ALAN, WE AGREED.

12:23.767 --> 12:25.400
WE'LL COOL DOWN,
CLEAR OUR HEADS,

12:25.400 --> 12:28.300
AND HAVE
A LOGICAL DISCUSSION
IN THE MORNING.

12:28.300 --> 12:29.600
RIGHT.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.700
ERIC, HONEY,
I KNOW THAT LAST NIGHT

12:32.700 --> 12:35.467
WAS LIKE
A DREAM COME TRUE.

12:35.467 --> 12:37.600
LOOK, MOM, I KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.934
I'M GOING BACK
TO THE STATION.

12:39.934 --> 12:41.767
AND I'M
GOING TO YELL.

12:41.767 --> 12:43.000
ALAN, IT WON'T HELP.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.300
I WON'T REMAIN QUIET

12:44.300 --> 12:47.667
WHILE MY SON MAKES
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
OF HIS LIFE.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.600
YOU MAY BE SOME
BIG-SHOT WEATHERMAN

12:50.600 --> 12:52.133
AT CHANNEL
WHATEVER IT IS,

12:52.133 --> 12:54.400
BUT HERE
YOU'RE STILL MY SON

12:54.400 --> 12:55.967
LIVING IN MY HOUSE.

12:55.967 --> 12:57.600
BUT I'M 18 TODAY.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.066
YOU WANT TO PLAY ADULT?
THEN LET'S PLAY.

13:00.066 --> 13:03.133
YOU WANT TO CONTINUE
SLEEPING UPSTAIRS?
YOU PAY RENT.

13:03.133 --> 13:05.200
CAR INSURANCE,
YOU PAY THAT, TOO.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.667
GROCERIES.
YOU GET THE IDEA?

13:07.667 --> 13:09.100
YEAH, I GET IT.

13:09.100 --> 13:12.300
YOU DON'T REALIZE
HOW IMPORTANT
THIS JOB IS TO ME.

13:12.300 --> 13:14.500
IF PAYING RENT
IS MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT,

13:14.500 --> 13:15.934
THEN HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO ME.

13:15.934 --> 13:19.467
YOU WANT YOUR RENT?
HERE'S YOUR RENT.

13:19.467 --> 13:21.667
WELL...BREAKFAST ANYWAY.

13:24.033 --> 13:26.233
ERIC--
WHAT?

13:26.233 --> 13:28.967
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

13:28.967 --> 13:30.800
THANKS, MOM.

13:32.934 --> 13:34.600
ALAN.

13:47.300 --> 13:48.567
WHERE ARE THEY?

13:48.567 --> 13:51.600
WHAT KIND OF DATE
GOES PAST 9:00?

13:51.600 --> 13:53.700
SHAWN, YOUR PACING'S
MAKING ME NERVOUS.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.834
AND YOU'RE NAGGING,
LIKE THAT'S HELPING ME?

13:55.834 --> 13:58.100
SEE WHAT
THEIR GOING OUT
IS DOING TO US?

13:58.100 --> 14:01.367
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE SHOULDN'T FIGHT.

14:01.367 --> 14:03.233
WE STILL HAVE
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

14:03.233 --> 14:05.233
WHICH IS GOING
QUITE WELL.

14:05.233 --> 14:06.900
WAIT.

14:06.900 --> 14:10.033
WHAT IF THEY REALLY
LIKE EACH OTHER
AND GET MARRIED?

14:11.934 --> 14:13.934
I'M GOING TO CALL
THE RESTAURANT.

14:13.934 --> 14:14.767
WHERE'D THEY GO?

14:14.767 --> 14:16.100
SOME ITALIAN RESTAURANT.

14:16.100 --> 14:18.900
O.K., O.K.
ITALIAN, ITALIAN...

14:18.900 --> 14:21.400
THERE'S MORE THAN ONE.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.200
HI, GUYS.

14:25.200 --> 14:26.400
STAY OUT OF TROUBLE?

14:26.400 --> 14:29.700
WE SHOULD BE ASKING YOU
THE SAME THING.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.000
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?

14:31.000 --> 14:34.500
JUST CHECKING
TO SEE IF SHE LEFT
ANY LIP-PRINTS.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.967
SHE? SHE HAPPENS
TO BE MY MOTHER.

14:36.967 --> 14:39.767
SHE HAPPENS TO BE
SEDUCING MY BUDDY.

14:39.767 --> 14:41.600
WE'VE BEEN
INSULTED ENOUGH.
LET'S GO.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.000
NOBODY'S GOING ANYWHERE.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.100
WE HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

14:45.100 --> 14:46.100
OH, NO.

14:46.100 --> 14:48.700
WE'RE SISTERS.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.100
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.000
NOBODY IS
NOBODY'S SISTER.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.000
LOOK, WE HAD
A GREAT TIME TONIGHT.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.300
OH, NO.

14:57.300 --> 15:00.800
BUT IT WOULD BE
TOO AWKWARD
FOR YOU GUYS,

15:00.800 --> 15:03.300
SO WE WON'T
SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

15:03.300 --> 15:06.500
WHAT, MY MOTHER ISN'T
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?

15:06.500 --> 15:08.400
YOU JUST NEVER
GAVE HIM A CHANCE.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.367
DANA!

15:10.367 --> 15:11.400
[DOOR SLAMS]

15:11.400 --> 15:12.934
DANA!

15:12.934 --> 15:15.400
AS BLIZZARD WATCH '96
CONTINUES,

15:15.400 --> 15:18.300
SCHOOLS TOMORROW
ARE ONCE AGAIN CLOSED.

15:18.300 --> 15:20.000
AH, THAT TAKES ME BACK.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.100
WE'RE GONNA--

15:21.100 --> 15:22.967
THIS JUST IN.

15:22.967 --> 15:26.767
WE JUST RECEIVED A CALL
FROM PRINCIPAL GEORGE FEENY,

15:26.767 --> 15:30.100
WHO SAID IT'LL TAKE
MORE THAN 32 INCHES OF SNOW

15:30.100 --> 15:31.967
TO CLOSE DOWN
JOHN ADAMS HIGH.

15:31.967 --> 15:35.133
AND "ERIC, YOUR REPORT
IS STILL DUE."

15:35.133 --> 15:37.967
HAPPY 100th BIRTHDAY,
MR. FEENY.

15:37.967 --> 15:40.467
LET'S TAKE ONE LAST LOOK
AT THE BIG MAP, SHALL WE?

15:40.467 --> 15:42.500
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

15:42.500 --> 15:45.100
AW, GUYS!

15:45.100 --> 15:47.600
THAT IS SO NICE.
WHO TOLD YOU?

15:47.600 --> 15:49.133
YOU DID.

15:49.133 --> 15:52.600
OH, WELL, I'D JUST
LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU.

15:52.600 --> 15:56.200
THESE LAST COUPLE DAYS
HAVE BEEN LIKE
A DREAM COME TRUE.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.100
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW,
PHILADELPHIA.

15:58.100 --> 16:00.300
AND WE'RE OUT.

16:00.300 --> 16:02.967
GUYS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WHAT A NICE THOUGHT.

16:02.967 --> 16:04.934
HEY, I'M CUTTING THE CAKE.

16:04.934 --> 16:07.000
OH, PAT, PAT...

16:07.000 --> 16:10.400
THE BIRTHDAY WISHES,
THE BALLOONS, THE CAKE,

16:10.400 --> 16:12.000
BUT ESPECIALLY THE JOB,

16:12.000 --> 16:15.400
THIS THE NICEST THING
ANYBODY'S EVER
DONE FOR ME.

16:15.400 --> 16:18.200
THERE'S NOT A NICE WAY
TO TELL YOU THIS.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.867
I APPRECIATE
YOU HELPING ME OUT,

16:19.867 --> 16:24.000
BUT I GOT
A REAL WEATHERMAN
COMING FROM BOSTON.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.400
I'M...SORRY?

16:26.400 --> 16:29.000
YOU DID GREAT, ERIC.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.100
THEN HOW COME
YOU'RE FIRING ME?

16:31.100 --> 16:32.600
COME ON, YOU'RE A KID.

16:32.600 --> 16:37.100
DID YOU EXPECT ME
TO HAND YOU THE JOB
FULL-TIME?

16:37.100 --> 16:40.500
NO. I WAS JUST
HAVING A LOT OF FUN,

16:40.500 --> 16:42.033
BUT...

16:42.033 --> 16:45.200
YEAH, I GUESS IT WAS
TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.367
BUT I LOVE BEING
AN INTERN HERE,

16:47.367 --> 16:49.000
SO I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.800
AFTER BEING ON THE AIR,

16:50.800 --> 16:53.100
CAN YOU GO BACK
TO BEING A GOFER?

16:53.100 --> 16:54.500
I GOT TO DO
SOMETHING.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.667
I'M NOT IN SCHOOL
ANYMORE.

16:57.367 --> 16:58.500
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:58.500 --> 17:00.400
WELL, I KIND OF
DROPPED OUT

17:00.400 --> 17:02.300
TO GIVE YOU GUYS
100%.

17:02.300 --> 17:05.367
OH, ERIC,
WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE.

17:05.367 --> 17:09.300
YOU DO KNOW
THE INTERNSHIP'S
ONLY OPEN TO STUDENTS.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.800
NO, NO, PAT.
DON'T DO THIS TO ME.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.300
YOU CAN'T TAKE THIS
AWAY FROM ME.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.967
I GOT NO PLACE
TO GO.

17:15.967 --> 17:18.000
IT'S NOT FAIR.

17:18.000 --> 17:21.767
LOOK, ERIC,
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

17:21.767 --> 17:24.300
AFTER COLLEGE,
YOU GIVE ME A CALL.

17:24.300 --> 17:27.100
I'LL BE HAPPY
TO GIVE YOU A JOB.

17:27.100 --> 17:28.200
YOU'RE A GOOD MAN.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.867
YOUR PARENTS
SHOULD BE REAL PROUD.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.033
[THUD]

17:50.100 --> 17:51.200
CARDBOARD.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.300
FIGURES.

17:53.300 --> 17:56.100
OH, ERIC,
THERE YOU ARE.

17:56.100 --> 17:57.867
DAD?

17:57.867 --> 17:59.467
YEAH.

17:59.467 --> 18:02.767
IF YOU CAME TO FIGHT,
I REALLY DON'T HAVE
THE STRENGTH--

18:02.767 --> 18:05.500
I JUST CAME TO SEE
HOW YOU'RE DOING,

18:05.500 --> 18:07.200
SEE WHERE YOU WORK.

18:09.500 --> 18:14.367
BOY, YOU KNOW, THIS PLACE
LOOKS A LOT BIGGER ON TV.

18:14.367 --> 18:16.667
DAD, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

18:16.667 --> 18:21.233
UH, WELL, I CAME
DOWN HERE 'CAUSE...

18:21.233 --> 18:23.800
WELL, I REALLY BLEW IT
THIS MORNING,

18:23.800 --> 18:26.734
AND I REALLY NEED
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

18:26.734 --> 18:28.000
WHAT?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.767
AFTER HIGH SCHOOL,
I NEVER WENT TO COLLEGE.

18:30.767 --> 18:32.667
I WENT INTO THE NAVY.

18:32.667 --> 18:33.834
I KNOW THAT.

18:33.834 --> 18:38.867
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW IS
HOW ANGRY MY DAD WAS.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.767
ANGRY ENOUGH
NOT TO WISH YOU
A HAPPY BIRTHDAY?

18:43.667 --> 18:44.734
I DESERVE THAT.

18:44.734 --> 18:48.033
HE TOOK OUT ALL HIS
FRUSTRATIONS ON ME

18:48.033 --> 18:49.800
THE WAY I DID ON YOU,

18:49.800 --> 18:54.934
AND THINGS WERE
NEVER THE SAME BETWEEN
ME AND HIM AFTER THAT.

18:54.934 --> 18:57.400
I DON'T HAVE
TO AGREE WITH YOU,

18:57.400 --> 18:59.000
BUT DROPPING OUT
OF SCHOOL

18:59.000 --> 19:00.467
MADE LIFE HARDER FOR ME.

19:00.467 --> 19:05.767
BUT THAT GIVES ME
NO RIGHT TO TURN
MY BACK ON YOU.

19:05.767 --> 19:07.300
YOU'RE MY SON.

19:07.300 --> 19:08.500
ALWAYS.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.734
I KNOW THAT.

19:11.734 --> 19:15.100
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKE
MY FATHER DID.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.800
NEITHER DO I.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SON.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.400
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, DAD.

19:26.800 --> 19:28.400
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

19:35.400 --> 19:37.400
AHEM.

19:37.400 --> 19:39.400
MR. MATTHEWS.

19:40.967 --> 19:44.500
YOU'RE PRETTY EARLY
FOR SOMEONE WHO'S
NO LONGER A STUDENT.

19:44.500 --> 19:46.600
UH, YEAH,
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.667
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT
ALL NIGHT, ACTUALLY,

19:48.667 --> 19:51.200
WHILE I WAS
WRITING THIS.

19:51.200 --> 19:52.934
YOUR HISTORY PAPER.

19:52.934 --> 19:54.500
IT'S JUST WHAT YOU WANTED.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.600
20,000 WORDS
ON THE CIVIL WAR.

19:56.600 --> 19:59.767
I SAID 2,000.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.033
WHOA. UH...

20:04.400 --> 20:05.934
THAT SHOULD DO IT.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.867
JUST LIKE THAT, HMM?

20:09.867 --> 20:11.734
THINK IT'S THAT EASY?

20:11.734 --> 20:13.300
YOU WALK IN HERE,

20:13.300 --> 20:15.100
TURN IN YOUR PAPER,

20:15.100 --> 20:17.033
AND ALL IS FORGOTTEN?

20:17.033 --> 20:20.567
I JUST HAD
MY BUTT KICKED OUT THERE
IN THE REAL WORLD.

20:20.567 --> 20:25.400
THEY FIRED ME,
AND I NEED SOMEBODY
TO CUT ME SOME SLACK.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.867
WHY SHOULD I
CUT YOU SOME SLACK?

20:27.867 --> 20:30.667
YOU GOT A JOB,
YOU LOST A JOB,

20:30.667 --> 20:32.400
SO GO AND FIND
ANOTHER ONE.

20:32.400 --> 20:34.834
WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL
DIPLOMA?

20:34.834 --> 20:37.500
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
KNOW THIS OR NOT,

20:37.500 --> 20:40.567
BUT IT'S REALLY TOUGH
OUT THERE.

20:40.567 --> 20:42.000
IS IT REALLY?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.900
YEAH.

20:43.900 --> 20:47.700
THEN PERHAPS YOU DID
LEARN SOMETHING
FROM THAT INTERNSHIP.

20:50.300 --> 20:51.800
WELCOME BACK.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.967
OH, THANK YOU,
MR. FEENY.

20:53.967 --> 20:55.033
DON'T HUG ME.

20:55.033 --> 20:56.734
[BELL RINGS]

21:03.834 --> 21:07.734
YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE'S
ONE OPEN IN THE BACK.

21:16.300 --> 21:19.767
I WOULD LIKE
TO SHIFT GEARS SLIGHTLY

21:19.767 --> 21:23.934
AND DISCUSS THOSE
TRAVELING ENTREPRENEURS

21:23.934 --> 21:25.867
CALLED THE CARPETBAGGERS.

21:35.033 --> 21:37.200
IT'S GOOD TO BE
LIKE THIS AGAIN.

21:37.200 --> 21:39.500
YEAH. BACK AT
EACH OTHER'S LIPS

21:39.500 --> 21:41.233
INSTEAD OF EACH OTHER'S
THROATS.

21:41.233 --> 21:44.367
SO WHAT IF YOUR MOM
WANTED TO DATE MR. TURNER.

21:44.367 --> 21:46.500
IT PROBABLY SHOULD'VE
NEVER AFFECTED US.

21:46.500 --> 21:48.600
I THINK
WE ACTED IMMATURE.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.667
PEOPLE SHOULD DATE
WHOEVER THEY WANT.

21:50.667 --> 21:51.934
I TOTALLY AGREE.

21:51.934 --> 21:55.033
LET'S PUT THIS
IN THE PAST
AND MOVE ON.

21:55.033 --> 21:56.467
MY MOM DOES.

21:56.467 --> 21:57.900
SO DOES MR. TURNER.

21:57.900 --> 22:01.200
HE'S MEETING A DATE
HERE TONIGHT
AT CHUBBIE'S.

22:01.200 --> 22:02.700
ISN'T THAT GREAT,
DANA?

22:02.700 --> 22:04.700
DANA?

22:04.700 --> 22:06.233
DANA?

22:08.133 --> 22:09.367
OH, MY GOD.

22:09.367 --> 22:11.867
MR. TURNER'S
HITTING ON MY AUNT.

22:11.867 --> 22:15.133
WE'RE GONNA BE COUSINS!

22:15.133 --> 22:17.200
AAH!
AAH!
