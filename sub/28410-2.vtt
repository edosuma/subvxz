10:17.992 --> 10:19.535
No, no. Please.

10:19.618 --> 10:21.037
{\an3}Please.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.540
(repeated electronic chime)

10:30.629 --> 10:32.631
{\an6}Would you?

10:30.629 --> 10:32.631
I got you, all right.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.845
Okay, uh...

10:37.928 --> 10:39.013
Yep.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.223
{\an1}Hello.
Sorry to bother you.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.059
But... (chuckles)

10:43.142 --> 10:45.394
{\an1}Um...

10:45.478 --> 10:47.396
Is that a bird out there?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.732
Uh, outside, before,
in the-the engine?

10:49.815 --> 10:51.692
Just-just now, like...

10:51.776 --> 10:53.903
Um, did we hit a bird?

10:53.986 --> 10:55.279
{\an3}Um...

10:56.530 --> 10:58.491
{\an5}I wouldn't know.

10:56.530 --> 10:58.491
{\an1}Okay.

10:58.574 --> 11:00.743
Do you think there's a way
we could maybe ask the pilot?

11:00.826 --> 11:01.535
{\an1}Um...

11:01.619 --> 11:03.245
I'd hate to trouble him
right now.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.289
Here's the thing, is that...

11:05.373 --> 11:07.291
We're still flying
and at an altitude

11:07.375 --> 11:08.751
where there are
no more birds.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.753
No more birds? Okay.

11:10.836 --> 11:12.922
{\an6}How do you know
there's no birds?

11:10.836 --> 11:12.922
{\an3}Sir?

11:13.005 --> 11:14.006
{\an3}Sir?

11:13.005 --> 11:14.006
I-I mean...

11:14.090 --> 11:15.925
{\an5}What? What?

11:14.090 --> 11:15.925
Sir, I need you
to lower your tone.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.094
{\an6}I'm not...

11:16.008 --> 11:18.094
{\an3}We'll be, we'll be
starting in-flight service

11:18.177 --> 11:19.929
{\an3}in a minute, so if you'd
like anything further,

11:20.012 --> 11:21.680
please let me know.

11:23.682 --> 11:26.268
Okay, I'll just-- I'll, um--
I'll shut up. I'm sorry.

11:26.352 --> 11:29.563
(chuckles)
I'm sorry. Thank you.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.488
(thunder rumbling softly)

11:37.571 --> 11:39.031
JOE:
It was.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.411
A bird.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.621
Real headache
coming out of Dulles.

11:45.704 --> 11:47.289
{\an1}I used to pilot
for Northern Gold Star.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.834
{\an1}They let us catch rides
on flights if there's room.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.794
{\an1}Yeah, this is
a good flight crew.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.295
{\an1}Donner, the pilot.
Nick and Tammy.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.755
I worked with them a lot.

11:54.839 --> 11:56.799
But the thing is,
they don't know.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.676
They'll never tell you
what's really going on.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.679
I don't fly anymore. One too
many mistakes I can't take back.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.475
{\an1}Yeah, that was a birdie.
(sighs)

12:06.559 --> 12:08.936
{\an1}Yeah.

12:09.019 --> 12:11.021
(thunder rumbling)

12:30.583 --> 12:32.168
(eerie music playing)

12:32.251 --> 12:36.005
{\an5}RODMAN:
So what do we really know
about Flight 1015?

12:36.088 --> 12:38.424
{\an5}We know that the last words
spoken by the pilot

12:38.507 --> 12:42.511
{\an5}to air traffic control were,
"Good night, New York."

12:42.595 --> 12:47.016
{\an5}We also know that it disappeared
at 11:15 p.m.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.018
(quietly):
I'm running out of time.

12:49.101 --> 12:51.687
{\an5}What could have happened
to cause the flight to vanish

12:51.770 --> 12:54.690
{\an5}without a trace?

12:51.770 --> 12:54.690
(electronic chime)

12:54.774 --> 12:56.192
{\an5}DONNER:
Folks, this is
the flight deck again

12:56.275 --> 12:58.986
{\an5}just to let everyone know
this storm system up ahead's

12:59.069 --> 13:01.489
{\an5}developing a little bit faster
than we anticipated.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.782
{\an5}We'll be maneuvering around it
as best we can,

13:03.866 --> 13:05.743
{\an5}but we do expect to hit
some rough patches.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.745
{\an5}Shouldn't be anything
to worry about,

13:07.828 --> 13:10.706
{\an5}but we ask you to all remain
in your seats if you can.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.541
Thank you.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.717
(thunder rumbling)

13:21.800 --> 13:26.597
{\an8}RODMAN: Chapter three:
"Every Detail Counts."

13:26.680 --> 13:30.017
{\an8}With a tragedy as enormous
as Flight 1015,

13:30.100 --> 13:33.062
{\an8}it's devastating
to think of the cost.

13:33.145 --> 13:37.066
{\an5}117 lives lost
when the pilot signed off

13:37.149 --> 13:39.068
from air traffic control

13:39.151 --> 13:43.030
{\an5}and the flight disappeared from
radar over the North Atlantic.

13:43.113 --> 13:44.406
Without any forensic evidence,

13:44.490 --> 13:46.909
{\an5}we have to start
looking for patterns,

13:46.992 --> 13:49.161
looking for clues,

13:49.245 --> 13:53.624
{\an5}small signs that could tell us
the bigger problem.

13:53.707 --> 13:57.753
{\an5}Most famous aviation mysteries
come from small beginnings:

13:57.836 --> 14:01.882
{\an5}a mechanical failure,
or fire in one of the cabins,

14:01.966 --> 14:05.427
{\an5}leading the crew to panic
and to bring the plane down.

14:05.511 --> 14:09.056
{\an5}The passengers would've looked
to the flight attendants

14:09.139 --> 14:12.893
{\an5}and known immediately
that something was wrong.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.229
{\an8}We know that the cockpit
of this particular aircraft

14:15.312 --> 14:16.814
{\an8}was equipped with cameras

14:16.897 --> 14:20.067
{\an8}that allowed the passengers
to watch the flight crew

14:20.150 --> 14:22.278
{\an8}through multiple monitors.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.238
{\an5}If the pilot were doing
something unusual,

14:24.321 --> 14:28.659
{\an5}it's likely that the whole cabin
would have noticed and reacted.

14:28.742 --> 14:32.288
{\an5}What seems more likely is
the idea that it was something

14:32.371 --> 14:34.748
truly unexpected and unique.

14:34.832 --> 14:38.210
{\an5}As the plane flew close
to a thunderstorm,

14:38.294 --> 14:40.004
{\an5}the pilot would need
to calmly communicate

14:40.087 --> 14:44.008
{\an5}with his fellow crew and keep
the flight under control.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.843
Was there something on board

14:45.926 --> 14:48.679
{\an5}that could've disrupted
the plane's communications?

14:48.762 --> 14:50.306
(quiet chatter)

14:50.389 --> 14:53.434
(sportscast playing over video)

14:56.020 --> 14:57.646
{\an1}JUSTIN:
Hi.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.316
Hello. Uh, I'm Justin.

15:00.399 --> 15:03.777
{\an1}I'm sorry, I-I know
this isn't really my business,

15:03.861 --> 15:05.988
but I just think
you may need to turn that off.

15:07.239 --> 15:08.991
Thank you for your input.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.452
{\an1}But, uh, you know
we are Sikh, right?

15:11.535 --> 15:13.621
Yeah. Absolutely.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.373
Yeah, and equal to us all. So...

15:17.416 --> 15:20.753
Okay, Justin.

15:20.836 --> 15:22.713
Then leave us all alone.

15:22.796 --> 15:25.633
Okay, I just, I feel like you do
need to turn that off, though.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.843
{\an1}It's on airplane mode.
It's on Wi-Fi.

15:27.926 --> 15:29.011
{\an6}JUSTIN: Are you gonna
turn it off or, like...?

15:27.926 --> 15:29.011
TAMMY: Mr. Sanderson?

15:29.094 --> 15:31.680
{\an4}Yes?

15:29.094 --> 15:31.680
{\an3}I'm gonna need you to go
back to your seat, please.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.390
But these guys, they're not
turning it off, so I...

15:33.474 --> 15:34.808
{\an1}Mr. Sanderson, I understand
that you're concerned.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.477
{\an1}I need you
to go back to your seat.

15:39.605 --> 15:40.522
Now.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.191
Okay.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.193
OMESH: What is he,
the cricket police?

15:44.276 --> 15:46.195
{\an3}TANVEERA:
Crazy.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.030
{\an1}TAMMY:
Guy needs to sit down.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.493
(seat belt clicks)

15:56.830 --> 15:59.708
{\an5}RODMAN:
Without any forensic evidence
to analyze,

15:59.792 --> 16:01.377
{\an5}we have to consider
other records

16:01.460 --> 16:04.380
left behind by Flight 1015.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.091
{\an5}This includes
the passenger manifest.

16:07.174 --> 16:09.093
And one infamous individual

16:09.176 --> 16:12.721
{\an5}at the front of the plane
immediately stands out:

16:12.805 --> 16:16.225
Russian citizen Igor Orlov.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.894
Igor was in witness protection

16:18.977 --> 16:22.106
{\an5}and was taking Flight 1015
to Tel Aviv

16:22.189 --> 16:25.943
{\an5}in order to testify
against the Russian mafia.

16:26.026 --> 16:29.029
{\an5}We know the Russian mob would do
anything in their power

16:29.113 --> 16:31.532
{\an5}to prevent Orlov
from testifying.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.868
{\an5}Is it possible that
they targeted Flight 1015

16:34.952 --> 16:36.954
in order to kill him?

16:39.039 --> 16:42.126
{\an5}Another detail
might fill in the picture.

16:42.209 --> 16:46.588
{\an5}Also listed on the passenger
manifest is a U.S. air marshal.

16:46.672 --> 16:50.718
{\an5}Was he on board the flight
in order to protect Igor Orlov?

16:50.801 --> 16:54.972
{\an5}Would he be able to tell us
of any threats to the aircraft?

16:57.891 --> 16:59.643
Excuse me.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.020
{\an5}Hi.

16:59.727 --> 17:02.020
I am very sorry

17:02.104 --> 17:04.522
about everything
from before, but, um...

17:06.358 --> 17:09.153
{\an1}...I really need to talk
to the air marshal.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.405
I don't know that there's one
aboard this flight.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.281
Uh, there is.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.284
{\an4}Okay?

17:13.365 --> 17:15.284
You know that?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.661
{\an5}Yeah. I do.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.661
{\an3}Okay.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.663
Mr. Sanderson, I don't know

17:19.747 --> 17:21.665
that there's an air marshal
aboard this flight.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.959
They don't notify the captain of
the presence of an air marshal.

17:24.041 --> 17:25.669
They definitely don't tell
the flight attendants.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.797
Okay, yeah, no, I get it.

17:28.881 --> 17:29.965
{\an1}I get it.

17:30.048 --> 17:31.008
You get it?

17:31.091 --> 17:33.135
I get it. Thank you.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.137
Could you do me a huge favor
and just-just sit?

17:35.220 --> 17:36.513
Yeah.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.265
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thank you.

17:38.348 --> 17:39.767
Okay.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.315
{\an1}Hi.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.109
{\an3}Hi.

17:49.193 --> 17:52.112
{\an1}(chuckles)
Mr. Popular.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.781
{\an3}Look, I know you
said you're a pilot.

17:53.864 --> 17:55.199
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

17:55.282 --> 17:56.742
{\an3}But you're an air
marshal, aren't you?

17:56.825 --> 17:59.328
Told you, I'm a pilot.

18:01.079 --> 18:02.873
{\an3}(sighs)

18:02.956 --> 18:05.793
{\an3}Listen, I'm an investigative
reporter, okay?

18:05.876 --> 18:08.378
{\an3}And I can be pretty sure
that an air marshal

18:08.462 --> 18:11.673
{\an3}is gonna look a lot like
a marshal in the air.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.133
{\an1}No.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.301
{\an1}(laughs):
I'm not an air marshal.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.844
{\an1}What-what do you want me
to tell you?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.513
I don't know.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.513
{\an1}Uh, I'm...

18:17.596 --> 18:20.182
{\an1}sorry to disappoint you,
brother; I'm just a pilot.

18:20.265 --> 18:24.186
{\an1}But I know air marshals,
and I know their job, Justin,

18:24.269 --> 18:26.522
{\an1}is to think
like a terrorist.

18:26.605 --> 18:30.067
{\an1}Now, the best way
to spot deceptive behavior...

18:31.944 --> 18:33.987
{\an1}...act like
a deceptive person.

{\an3}Russian Premier League.
We play for Grozny.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.827
We're playing a friendly game

{\an3}Mr. Sanderson,
are you kidding me?

20:09.666 --> 20:11.501
This Russian soccer league thing
is total bullshit.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.503
{\an6}What are you talking about?
Mr. Sanderson...

20:11.585 --> 20:13.503
This guy, one of them

20:13.587 --> 20:15.005
{\an5}is Igor Orlov, all right?

20:13.587 --> 20:15.005
Listen. Listen to me.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.131
{\an6}TAMMY:
I've alerted the captain
to your behavior.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.175
{\an5}You need to check their I.D.s.

20:16.214 --> 20:18.175
Don't worry about it.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.969
The Russian mafia
wants to kill Igor Orlov.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.679
Okay? They want...

20:22.763 --> 20:25.265
(shouting in Russian)

Do not say it.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.237
{\an8}And incredibly,

33:09.320 --> 33:13.074
{\an8}every passenger
from Flight 1015 had survived,

33:13.157 --> 33:14.534
{\an8}except one.

33:14.617 --> 33:16.577
{\an8}None of the survivors
could explain it,

33:16.661 --> 33:18.538
{\an8}but Justin Sanderson
was missing,

33:18.621 --> 33:22.417
{\an8}his whereabouts,
still to this day, unknown.

33:30.425 --> 33:32.260
Hey, buddy.

33:32.343 --> 33:33.970
{\an1}Hey.

33:34.053 --> 33:36.097
Hey, where you going?

33:38.307 --> 33:41.060
(quiet murmuring)

33:46.649 --> 33:48.568
That's him.
Is that him?

33:48.651 --> 33:50.445
Hey, I tried to save us.

33:50.528 --> 33:54.198
(angry murmuring)

33:56.659 --> 33:58.453
Justin, you did this.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.330
How could you do this?

34:01.414 --> 34:03.458
What did you people do, huh?!
Nothing!

34:05.918 --> 34:07.920
What did you do?!
Get away from me!

34:08.880 --> 34:09.630
Get away!

34:09.714 --> 34:12.091
{\an5}How could you do this, asshole?!

34:09.714 --> 34:12.091
No! No!

34:12.175 --> 34:14.552
(angry clamoring)

34:17.179 --> 34:19.098
(clamoring fades)

34:19.181 --> 34:22.018
In his final moments,
Justin Sanderson made the case

34:22.101 --> 34:24.937
that he did everything he could
to avert disaster.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.648
But in the end,
he was an investigative reporter

34:27.732 --> 34:30.109
unwilling to
investigate himself,

34:30.193 --> 34:32.152
until it was too late.

34:32.235 --> 34:34.322
Justin discovered
that the flight path to hell

34:34.405 --> 34:36.491
is paved with good intentions,

34:36.574 --> 34:39.994
and it passes directly...

34:40.077 --> 34:42.121
through The Twilight Zone.
